00:08.240 --> 00:10.920
<i>Helene could be arriving</i> <i>
in London any minute now.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.280
Don't worry. I didn't get
anything out of her.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.920
Bravo, Eve.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.320
<i>So, Helene,</i> <i>
You want to kill her?</i>

00:15.360 --> 00:16.680
<i>Yes.
But she might</i>

00:16.720 --> 00:17.840
<i>be able to help you.</i>

00:19.400 --> 00:20.640
Carolyn.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.920
How many of us are there?

00:21.960 --> 00:24.080
<i>Johan is alive.</i>

00:24.120 --> 00:25.240
<i>But he drowned.</i>

00:25.280 --> 00:26.920
<i>The police found his body</i> <i>
in the lake.</i>

00:26.960 --> 00:28.520
I am sorry

00:28.560 --> 00:29.640
for having hit you over the head
with an oar.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.800
<i>Did you really think</i> <i>
I wouldn't get back at you?</i>

00:39.760 --> 00:41.000
It's not happening.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.880
None of this is sterilized. Relax.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.920
Have you lost your mind?

00:47.960 --> 00:50.200
- She's got their anatomy.
- Uh...

00:50.240 --> 00:51.840
Of corpses...
I mean, it's got to be

00:51.880 --> 00:53.960
impaling an organ.
Ah, so dramatic.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.360
It could be slicing into
an, uh... An artery!

00:55.400 --> 00:56.440
Can I see it?

00:56.480 --> 00:57.880
Please, keep still.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.160
No, don't! Don't...
She shouldn't see it.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.360
It's fine. Look.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.160
It's disgusting.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.680
Get it out of me!
We need a hospital.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.240
- We need a hospital.
- No way.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.080
Why is she here? Get rid of her.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.880
I need quiet. Let me focus.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.440
Bite down on this.

01:14.480 --> 01:17.000
I need you to breathe deeply and slowly.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.880
Faster your heart beats,
faster your blood pumps,

01:18.920 --> 01:20.240
and we don't want
your blood pumping fast.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.040
- Okay?
- Here.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.440
Just... Just squeeze down
on my hand.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.080
Squeeze down...
No, just squeeze down

01:26.120 --> 01:26.960
- on my hand
- I'm gonna count to three.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.320
Okay?
One, two...

01:32.200 --> 01:33.240
Better to surprise her.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.800
- You did great.
- Okay.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.080
I just need to clean it...
Ow!

01:58.400 --> 01:59.240
You've changed.

02:00.440 --> 02:01.440
You haven't.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.880
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

02:04.920 --> 02:05.680
It's a sad thing.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.200
How did you find me?

02:09.240 --> 02:11.240
Karolina.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.920
She's even a worse liar
than she was a novelist.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.080
- What do you want?
- There's someone coming for you.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.480
Is it you? Here to finish
what you started?

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
Fair, but wrong.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.920
I will tell you who it is.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.800
You tried to kill me
and left me for dead.

02:27.840 --> 02:32.000
Then you run an MI6 task force
trying to unmask The Twelve.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.440
Then you betrayed
your own country

02:34.480 --> 02:35.960
and jumped into bed
with the Russians.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.000
Why would I believe you?

02:40.040 --> 02:43.400
Because, Lars, the artist
formerly known as Johan,

02:43.440 --> 02:44.880
you have no choice.

02:44.920 --> 02:48.760
Someone is brutally
torturing your peers.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.240
And you're next.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.280
What do you want?

02:52.560 --> 02:53.480
I'm here to offer you a deal.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.400
I'll tell you
who's coming for you,

02:58.960 --> 03:03.360
if you tell me
who ordered my son's death.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.160
Remember your father?

03:05.320 --> 03:07.360
There's always
collateral damage.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.880
You of all people know that.

03:09.400 --> 03:10.680
Not my son.

03:15.880 --> 03:16.720
Tea's in the kitchen.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
Two sugars.

03:19.880 --> 03:20.880
Oh.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.880
So I'm making it, am I?

03:26.280 --> 03:28.200
Looks like gun
found you first, huh?

03:28.240 --> 03:29.800
This was gun?

03:29.840 --> 03:30.840
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's because of me.

03:31.840 --> 03:32.880
Why?
Helene.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.360
Punishing me.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.200
Get over yourself.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.280
It's because I didn't
finish a job she gave me.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.960
Or it's both.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.120
Helene likes to kill two birds
with one stone.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.640
One arrow.

03:50.960 --> 03:51.760
Hey, Pam?

03:52.640 --> 03:53.720
I'm impressed.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.120
Just a flesh wound.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.800
Which is insanely lucky.
Ha!

03:58.840 --> 04:00.480
It's not luck, gun missed.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.080
It was intentional.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.240
Did you get antibiotics
for your ear infection?

04:04.280 --> 04:05.800
- Yes.
- She's going to need them.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.040
What about my ear?

04:08.080 --> 04:10.040
Who cares about your ear?
Give them to her.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.920
Are you going to apologise
for shooting me?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.400
She shot you?

04:13.440 --> 04:14.200
Yes.
- Yes.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.640
Barely, just in the hand.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.440
That is an extremely
painful place.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.440
Acupuncture.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.640
All about working with
the invisible meridians
in our bodies.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.320
Yup. I do know
what acupuncture is.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.480
Was it you?

04:40.520 --> 04:41.720
Did I get your son killed?

04:44.320 --> 04:45.320
Maybe.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.760
Did you?

04:51.440 --> 04:52.960
No.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.480
So can you get me a name?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.720
Who's coming after me?

04:55.760 --> 04:57.240
Give me my name
and I'll give you yours.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.160
Come on.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.160
The only reason you're here
alone in the woods with me

05:03.200 --> 05:04.720
is because

05:04.760 --> 05:05.920
you've no other options.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.800
But can I be trusted?

05:10.080 --> 05:10.840
Tricky.

05:16.840 --> 05:17.920
- It's Helene.
- Helene?

05:20.720 --> 05:23.280
You surprised it's a woman?

05:23.320 --> 05:25.760
Anyone would think
that a vagina was
an invisibility cloak.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.200
What does she want from you?

05:29.240 --> 05:31.280
- Ask her.
- But you should.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.400
You will meet her.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.800
I will not.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.920
You will.
I'll ask you to meet me.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.560
And then you show up.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.640
Now that will really shock her.

05:39.680 --> 05:43.120
That's if you want to know
who ordered your son's death,
of course.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.240
Fine. Make the call.

06:37.920 --> 06:38.680
Go away.

06:47.880 --> 06:48.960
How's it feel?

06:49.000 --> 06:51.120
She just gave me stitches

06:51.160 --> 06:53.840
with a sewing kit from
a Christmas cracker, so...

07:00.760 --> 07:01.760
I'm serious, Eve.

07:03.440 --> 07:04.480
Go.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.160
Oh, oh.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.760
- Put this on.
- Give it to me.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.880
- Put your arm in...
- Uh, I can do it myself.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.200
Okay.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.560
You had me arrested.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.680
I thought locking you away
might be good for me.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.480
Was it?

08:55.240 --> 08:56.080
There.

08:57.920 --> 08:58.680
Suits you.

09:01.080 --> 09:03.240
Helene is going to try
and kill you again.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.680
What are you doing?

09:06.560 --> 09:07.840
Ah. Got to go.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.800
No, don't be ridiculous.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.200
Helene thinks you are ready,
but the first hit is never easy.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.320
Do you think you're ready?

09:26.240 --> 09:27.560
Yeah.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.760
How are you going to do it?

09:29.200 --> 09:30.360
Um...

09:34.320 --> 09:35.440
You need to have a plan.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.760
I'm working on something.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.840
Listen. What happened
to Villanelle

09:39.840 --> 09:40.840
will be me next.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.160
And then, one day,

09:44.200 --> 09:45.080
it will be you.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.160
No.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.400
She doesn't follow rules.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.760
I will.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.280
Once you kill The Twelve,
that's it.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.640
No going back.

09:59.880 --> 10:00.840
Hmm?

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
You want a ride?

10:25.920 --> 10:27.920
No.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.360
You know, you can just
get these at supermarkets?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.240
They have them
with the trolleys.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.520
Come on.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.800
It's fun.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.040
I thought I lost you there
for a minute.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.120
And?

10:48.280 --> 10:49.040
I didn't like it.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.880
Do you know who Lars Meyer is?

10:54.920 --> 10:57.320
He's high up in The Twelve,
and he's connected to Carolyn.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.960
I mean, maybe she's at the top.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.600
I have an address
to the squat in Berlin and...

11:04.960 --> 11:07.760
Look, I know
this is going to end badly.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.400
- But we can't just walk away.
- I don't care.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.800
I have my own stuff to do.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.720
- It's not going to end...
- Eve, just go!

11:22.880 --> 11:23.680
Okay.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.160
The brakes are a little...

11:54.920 --> 11:56.320
Remind me
why I'm doing this again.

11:56.360 --> 11:57.840
<i>Which part,</i> <i>
abducting minors,</i>

11:57.880 --> 11:58.840
<i>or leaving me in London?</i>

12:00.200 --> 12:01.400
All of it.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.680
<i>Because it's The Twelve,</i>

12:03.720 --> 12:05.960
<i>Bill, Kenny,</i>

12:06.000 --> 12:08.400
<i>and there's that time</i> <i>
they forked your husband</i> <i>
in the throat.</i>

12:08.440 --> 12:09.840
I can't believe...

12:09.880 --> 12:11.480
I can't believe
I believed her.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.720
<i>Villanelle?</i>

12:12.760 --> 12:14.560
No, Carolyn. She's Twelve.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.840
As in Original Twelve.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.000
She's played me since
the moment she knocked
on my front door.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.320
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:21.360 --> 12:22.840
<i>She should go to Vegas.</i> <i>
She'd clean up.</i>

12:24.680 --> 12:25.720
<i>All right.</i> <i>
Let me try and find her.</i>

12:26.200 --> 12:27.200
Thank you.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.720
Are you okay?

12:50.680 --> 12:51.680
Just a headache.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.320
Painkillers.

13:03.920 --> 13:04.680
Thanks.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
<i>Yes?</i>

14:04.520 --> 14:05.800
You said
the squat was in Berlin.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.280
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:07.320 --> 14:08.560
So is Carolyn.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.680
<i>Carolyn?</i>

14:09.720 --> 14:11.520
She's looking for Lars.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.960
<i>Wait, what?</i><i>
How do you know...</i>

14:27.000 --> 14:28.680
...meatballs, delicious!

14:28.720 --> 14:30.800
Juicy meatball subs!

14:32.200 --> 14:34.240
Cheesy, meaty sandwiches.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.760
Sandwiches!

14:37.800 --> 14:39.280
Best balls in town.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.040
Hey, baby.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.400
- You new?
- Yeah.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.360
Oh! Welcome aboard!

14:49.920 --> 14:51.320
How cute!

14:51.360 --> 14:52.520
Sandwiches!

14:53.520 --> 14:54.720
Sandwiches!

14:55.600 --> 14:56.680
Best balls in town.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.960
Sandwiches!

14:59.000 --> 15:00.680
Sandwiches, sandwiches.

15:00.720 --> 15:01.840
You wanna try?
Best balls in town.

15:04.840 --> 15:05.920
Tasty doner!

15:07.160 --> 15:09.320
Fiery beef!

15:09.360 --> 15:10.760
You're shy girl, yeah?

15:11.760 --> 15:13.320
- A bit, yeah.
- Aw.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.440
Don't worry.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.720
You're gonna be great.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.240
I was shy when I started too.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.080
Cheesy! Cheesy, hammy sandwich!

15:22.120 --> 15:24.360
I was alone
in this butthole country

15:24.400 --> 15:26.200
without a penny to my name.

15:26.240 --> 15:27.480
That must have been hard.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.400
Hard. <i>Ai, chica.</i>
Hard as marbles.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.360
But now look at me.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.160
Happy. Got a free
coffee this morning,

15:35.200 --> 15:38.040
and my mama is going to
fly out and visit me.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.440
Oh.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.880
I really love my mama.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.760
That's so great. Um...

15:46.800 --> 15:48.640
I'm just gonna go over here
and see if I have more luck.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.880
- Okay, baby.
- Okay.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.920
- Sandwiches!
- Sandwiches!

15:53.440 --> 15:54.840
Sandwiches!

15:54.880 --> 15:56.640
Are you sure she's
the right person?

15:56.680 --> 15:57.640
Yes. Why?

15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
Well, she's...

15:59.120 --> 16:00.160
nice.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.200
- <i>-
- Will she know</i> <i>what she's done wrong?</i>
- No.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.880
<i>We don't get to ask</i> <i>
and we don't get to think,</i>

16:08.360 --> 16:09.600
<i>just have to do.</i>

16:10.320 --> 16:12.000
It's not nice,

16:12.040 --> 16:13.640
but it is necessary.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.760
Sandwiches!

16:14.800 --> 16:16.440
She's just not
what I was expecting.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.920
This is the life
you're signing up for.

16:19.200 --> 16:19.960
Walk away now,

16:22.040 --> 16:22.880
or kill her.

16:23.880 --> 16:24.880
Your call.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.440
Sandwiches!

17:08.200 --> 17:09.200
Ah.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.520
Carolyn.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.520
You have a very large stride.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.120
Funny, my father
always said that.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.880
You also have a nasty habit
of scuppering my plans.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.920
Oh, yes. You want me dead.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.480
Oh, that's nothing
that can't be solved.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.160
I'll watch my back.

17:46.880 --> 17:50.800
I was so excited
when I received Lars's call.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.800
It was nice
to be noticed, but...

17:53.840 --> 17:56.120
You showing up,.
Now that really is a treat.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.800
Are you one of us, Carolyn?

18:02.160 --> 18:05.280
So sorry, I just had
a very vivid memory
of throwing up over there.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.360
Oh, so you've been here before?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.120
You really do get around.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.040
Well,
it was a long time ago.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.440
I was dared to down an
entire bottle of Krauterlikor.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.640
I was spinning around
in circles.

18:13.680 --> 18:14.800
It was really quite awful.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.200
I mean, the vomit just

18:19.720 --> 18:21.760
erupted out of me
like Mount Vesuvius.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.080
Well, that's the chit-chat
done, so...

18:26.360 --> 18:27.800
Why are you targeting Lars?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.800
Why are you doing
his dirty work?

18:30.800 --> 18:32.120
How do you know
he's not doing mine?

18:32.160 --> 18:33.120
Oh, well, I don't.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.480
I want the name of his superior.

18:38.520 --> 18:41.480
He can give it willingly,
or it will be taken by force.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.080
You're familiar with my work?

18:43.120 --> 18:43.880
Yes.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.640
You seem to have
a sort of foot fetish.

18:46.680 --> 18:48.280
It's a very nice touch.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.000
Thank you.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.800
That means a lot
from someone like you.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.640
My father knew your father.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.280
You're not...

19:03.320 --> 19:04.680
You are... You...

19:06.040 --> 19:07.680
You're Jacques' daughter?

19:07.720 --> 19:08.720
I am.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.280
My father loved him.

19:14.320 --> 19:19.600
It strikes me that
we're quite similar, you and I.

19:19.640 --> 19:25.680
- Both masters of our own games.
- In very different rules.

19:25.720 --> 19:29.400
Why are you risking your life
for the human equivalent
of a lump of ham?

19:29.440 --> 19:30.760
Am I risking my life?

19:34.680 --> 19:37.880
The name of the superior,
and I might spare his life.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.920
But I'm not a patient woman.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.680
Righty-ho.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.840
You're not going to shoot me
in the back, are you?

19:49.880 --> 19:51.160
Oh, that wouldn't
be very polite.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.000
Good. You're learning.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.240
I think it was a big guy.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.360
I would've had...

20:12.120 --> 20:13.120
Hey.

20:14.200 --> 20:14.960
What's wrong?

20:16.600 --> 20:17.600
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
Of course.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.160
Did someone upset you?

20:32.160 --> 20:34.160
That happens.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.040
But you grow a thick skin
like a big elephant.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.480
Just give it a week or two
and then you'll be fine.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.520
You'll stop caring.

20:40.520 --> 20:41.600
I'm sorry.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.640
Hmm?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.440
Come on here!

20:53.120 --> 20:54.120
Come on!

21:00.760 --> 21:01.760
No!

21:03.520 --> 21:04.760
No! Oh, please!

21:06.120 --> 21:06.880
No!

21:12.880 --> 21:15.280
You don't have to do this.
Please!

21:17.760 --> 21:18.800
Thank you for being kind to me.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.840
Is Kreuzberg far?

21:45.880 --> 21:46.760
No, 10 minutes.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.880
Stop, stop!

21:52.920 --> 21:53.680
<i>Danke. Danke.</i>

21:54.080 --> 21:55.360
Um...

21:55.400 --> 21:56.600
Can you push... Forward?

21:56.640 --> 21:58.120
Go ahead, forward, thank you.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.840
<i>Guten tag. Guten tag!</i>

22:03.880 --> 22:04.680
I'm sorry.
Do you speak...

22:04.720 --> 22:06.120
Do you speak English?

22:06.160 --> 22:08.080
- Yeah.
- Uh... Uh, that French lady who just left,

22:08.120 --> 22:09.640
I... I was supposed to meet her.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.760
Did she say where she was going?

22:10.800 --> 22:12.160
No, no,
I'm afraid not.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.080
She was just here with a...
A... A British lady.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.280
- British...
- Yeah.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.680
- Tall, red hair.
- Yeah. A good knot.

22:17.720 --> 22:18.800
- Is she still here?
- No. No.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.800
She left about...
About 15 minutes ago.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.280
Thank you.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.880
I wanna follow that car
that turned right. Thank you.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.680
This is embarrassing.

22:40.720 --> 22:41.800
I'll blow my brains out

22:41.840 --> 22:43.880
before I betray anyone
for that bitch.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.760
Have you got me a name?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.280
I'll tell you who killed Kenny.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.520
You.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.240
You didn't pull the trigger,

22:52.280 --> 22:54.040
but you killed him.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.800
Try and tell me something
I don't already know.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.360
Still, I need a name

22:59.400 --> 23:01.080
and I am relying on your honour.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.320
If you've got any left.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.480
Why are you not eating?

23:27.480 --> 23:29.200
She seemed like a good person.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.680
When this job get easy,
then it's time to get worried.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.680
So, embalming.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.600
- Did you enjoy it?
- I loved it.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.440
What are you doing here?

23:44.760 --> 23:45.920
Do you think I'm crap
or something?

23:47.400 --> 23:48.200
You keep trying to make me quit.

23:48.640 --> 23:49.640
No,

23:50.160 --> 23:52.000
I just don't

23:52.040 --> 23:54.400
normally train girls like you.

23:55.720 --> 23:58.800
Usually people who have
no other chance,

23:58.840 --> 23:59.840
or options.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.120
Why are you here?

24:07.840 --> 24:09.360
Helene's the first person
who believed in me.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.680
And I think that could be
good at it.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.480
Why are you here?

24:19.400 --> 24:20.760
Things kind of, uh,

24:21.360 --> 24:22.200
snowballed.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.200
- Hamster-
- Hamster.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.200
Fancy seeing you here.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.680
Uh...

24:30.720 --> 24:31.640
- Are you gonna skate or...
- I'm busy.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.760
Oh.
- I'm sorry.

24:34.960 --> 24:35.720
Okay.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.280
Pam.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.560
Life is miserable.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.080
Go and take the joy
when it comes along.

25:02.240 --> 25:03.800
Oh, don't worry,
I won't bother you again.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.640
Mmm.

25:53.960 --> 25:54.720
Huh.

26:01.480 --> 26:02.680
Mmm-hmm?

26:04.240 --> 26:05.440
Good.

26:07.320 --> 26:08.760
Let's have Pam do it.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.800
A challenge.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.800
You're stalking me again.

26:52.840 --> 26:53.800
What did Carolyn
have to say?

26:55.600 --> 26:56.600
Carolyn?

26:57.920 --> 26:58.880
Oh, you had the squat.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.280
So you're working together.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.680
Please. She wishes.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.960
Drink?
No.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.080
Cheers.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.720
I hear Villanelle
had a lucky escape.

27:19.320 --> 27:20.320
What a relief.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.840
So,

27:24.920 --> 27:25.880
we have a bath,

27:27.080 --> 27:27.840
you kiss me,

27:30.320 --> 27:32.000
and now you come to my hotel.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.320
What is it you want, Eve?

27:35.360 --> 27:37.280
Where's Carolyn?

27:37.320 --> 27:38.920
God...

27:38.960 --> 27:40.760
You're always, "Go. Go, go!"

27:43.400 --> 27:44.400
Come.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.480
Sit.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.760
Ahhh!

27:57.000 --> 27:57.840
Surprise!

28:02.800 --> 28:04.800
There's gonna be consequences,
Villanelle, you know that.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.000
You...

28:10.080 --> 28:11.080
Eve!

28:13.720 --> 28:14.720
Ah!

28:32.920 --> 28:34.800
Make it glorious. Huh?

29:16.400 --> 29:17.160
Where are you going?

29:18.960 --> 29:19.760
I'm done with you.

30:01.960 --> 30:02.920
Yusuf?

30:04.000 --> 30:05.040
<i>Cobra Cabs, Berlin.</i>

30:06.000 --> 30:08.160
Huh?

30:08.200 --> 30:09.920
<i>Carolyn paid for a taxi</i> <i>
with them this morning.</i>

30:13.400 --> 30:14.960
Thank you. Oh, my God.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.440
Thank you.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.120
<i>Don't get yourself killed.</i>

30:37.240 --> 30:38.720
Hello.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.520
Are you sure you're...

30:39.560 --> 30:40.920
Hey.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.880
Maybe. I wondered
if you could help me.

30:45.920 --> 30:46.880
Have you seen

30:47.640 --> 30:48.640
this lady?

30:51.280 --> 30:52.160
Oh, yeah.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.560
Earlier today.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.560
She left my car in a hurry.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.320
Oh, did she say
where she was going?

30:57.360 --> 30:58.960
Nope.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.680
The thing is, if people don't
interfere with me,

31:02.680 --> 31:04.200
I don't interfere with them.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.320
That's my moral code.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.760
Ah.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.360
Yeah.

31:11.400 --> 31:15.200
Yeah, well,
this lady was a boss from hell.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.520
She made me a pawn in her
international killing ring.

31:17.560 --> 31:19.320
She got me shot,
and she never paid.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.800
Is that breaking the moral code?

31:21.840 --> 31:23.120
Damn right it is.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.480
Homie!

31:52.080 --> 31:53.080
Well?

32:23.920 --> 32:27.320
Fred is the only other driver
working out that far.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.200
Your lady got
another cab after me

32:29.240 --> 32:30.840
and it was with Fred.

32:33.640 --> 32:34.920
Was this lady older?

32:34.960 --> 32:35.840
Uh, yes.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.520
Yeah, I drove her.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.240
It's just I get so many fares
every day, you know,

32:42.760 --> 32:44.080
it's hard to remember.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.040
If you want a bribe,
can you just tell me how much?

32:52.240 --> 32:54.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's be chill. 50's a lot.

32:56.360 --> 32:57.120
20 is fine.

32:58.240 --> 32:58.960
Do you have change?

33:00.160 --> 33:01.160
Thank you.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.320
Well, you really are
like a bad penny.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.360
Switching taxis doesn't work
when the driver has
a moral code.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.920
A word of advice, Eve,

33:44.960 --> 33:47.160
killing Lars
would be a very bad move.

33:47.200 --> 33:48.440
Who says he is the one
I want to kill?

33:50.360 --> 33:52.400
Janice.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.960
You were a member
of The Twelve all along.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.360
No.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.560
I was infiltrating
an anarchist group.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.280
- It was my first...
- Just stop.

34:02.320 --> 34:03.960
Lars went by
the name Johan then.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.200
He was there at the beginning.
He was a...

34:05.240 --> 34:06.320
Beginning of what?

34:06.360 --> 34:07.320
Stop interrupting.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.040
They were revolutionaries.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.960
Johan and his chums
had ideas about causing chaos,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.560
you know,
just disrupting the status quo.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.360
Whatever. I'm sure
it all seemed very

34:19.400 --> 34:20.560
alluring at the time.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.760
But of course, he went astray

34:21.800 --> 34:23.840
because power
inevitably corrupts.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.840
Evidently.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.480
I am not Twelve.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.920
You are full of shit.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.800
You don't care who you betray.
You are rotten to the core.

34:33.840 --> 34:35.920
God's sake, Eve.
We both want the same thing.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.520
I'm just doing
a much better job.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.840
So stop stomping around
threatening to kill people

34:40.880 --> 34:42.600
and let me do my thing.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.480
I am this close!

34:49.440 --> 34:51.560
If I thought
that man killed my son

34:51.600 --> 34:52.880
he'd be dead already,

34:54.040 --> 34:55.440
but he didn't.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.440
He can tell us who did though.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.960
This isn't about Kenny.

35:04.240 --> 35:05.320
It is.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.760
For me.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.520
Just give me
an evening with him.

35:18.680 --> 35:19.800
Fine.

35:28.960 --> 35:29.720
Carolyn!

35:34.200 --> 35:36.440
Mmm, yeah. Tree.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.800
Tree, tree, tree.

35:50.040 --> 35:52.120
I'm sorry you saw me like that.

35:52.160 --> 35:53.640
You and me both.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.680
You're not like the other women.

36:06.400 --> 36:07.760
You can keep up with me.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.320
I need a name.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.000
I know.

36:20.200 --> 36:20.960
I was angry.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.280
I'm working on it.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.960
You should really
lock your door.

36:28.000 --> 36:28.760
Eve, don't.

36:31.720 --> 36:32.720
No!

36:33.960 --> 36:35.320
How does it feel?

36:52.280 --> 36:53.320
Well done.

36:56.920 --> 36:57.680
You've killed one

37:00.880 --> 37:01.680
and they'll just replace him.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.360
Again and again.

37:12.800 --> 37:13.720
Over

37:15.240 --> 37:17.920
and over and over.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.560
No-one can save you.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.200
Hey.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.720
My back hurts.

41:16.880 --> 41:17.800
Can I stay here?

41:38.320 --> 41:40.000
<i>Paid for the pickle</i> <i>
and a Coke.</i>

41:40.040 --> 41:42.200
<i>Hey, what was the last
really fun thing that you did?</i>

41:42.240 --> 41:43.680
<i>I can't remember.</i>

41:43.720 --> 41:46.040
Oh, you're in luck,
because I put the "F" in "fun."

41:46.080 --> 41:47.720
I hope you don't
mind the intrusion.

41:47.760 --> 41:50.720
I bought us both an aperitif.

41:50.760 --> 41:55.760
<i>All we can do in life</i> <i>
is try to find some joy</i> <i>
in the little things.</i>

41:55.800 --> 41:58.000
- What can you see?
- Hairy pigs.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.320
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

41:59.360 --> 42:00.760
You look like
an angry Santa Claus.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.520
It's an incredible feeling

42:02.560 --> 42:03.920
<i>being inches</i>

42:03.960 --> 42:05.640
<i>from the thing</i> <i>
you've been looking for.</i>
