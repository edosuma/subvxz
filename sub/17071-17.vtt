Whoo! Another round!
[ Laughs ]

17:31.151 --> 17:33.386
Then if I was with
my Chinese friends,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.888
I could just let it fly
because they understood.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.690
Hey, I think it spread
to my eyelid.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.359
Hey, check this out!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.228
[ Laughs ]

17:42.562 --> 17:44.131
I got that butt thing
again.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.199
Oh, Hank!
Hank!

17:46.233 --> 17:49.302
If I pass out,
I've got $2 worth

17:49.336 --> 17:51.238
of Bob Seger
in the jukebox.

17:51.271 --> 17:53.540
If "Like a Rock" comes on,
wake me up.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.708
Can someone turn
the A.C. up?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.278
It is hot as hell in here.
The twins are drenched.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.413
[ Laughter ]

18:00.447 --> 18:03.150
Louis: And then, eventually,
I developed a pre-game routine

18:03.183 --> 18:04.617
to fight it
the best I could.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.154
My Flush Pack --
Before I drink,

18:07.187 --> 18:08.288
I take these precautions

18:08.321 --> 18:10.123
and it lessens
the side effects --

18:10.157 --> 18:14.427
PEPCID, inhaler,
eye drops, TUMS.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.096
You have to do all this nonsense
every time you drink?

18:17.130 --> 18:19.732
I don't write checks
my body can't cash.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.168
Also,
there's some cash in here.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.304
I don't understand.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.239
Why didn't you just tell me
about the tickets?

18:26.273 --> 18:28.775
Well, because every little thing
sets you off...

18:28.808 --> 18:30.677
Honey --
...because you're
a road grump.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.345
[ Sighs ]

18:32.379 --> 18:34.147
What are you
talking about?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.915
As soon as things
don't go your way,

18:35.948 --> 18:39.118
you get super sensitive
and make everyone tense.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.953
No, I don't.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.455
I run on a schedule,

18:42.489 --> 18:44.157
but that's just to make things
more efficient.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.525
I'm a road boss.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.627
Road trips are supposed
to be fun.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.296
If I knew
it was gonna be like this,

18:49.329 --> 18:51.164
I would have just given you
the $20

18:51.198 --> 18:52.632
to buy the chair
back in Orlando.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.067
[ Sighs ]

18:56.803 --> 18:58.205
You both feel this way?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.474
I didn't know.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.443
I don't want
to be a road grump.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.812
I want to have fun
on this trip, too.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.514
It's too late.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.382
You're already mad
about the parking tickets.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.620
[ Gasps ]

19:13.653 --> 19:15.655
What parking tickets?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.290
Jessica, they can track you down
by your license plate.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.658
Oh, yeah?

19:18.691 --> 19:21.228
**

19:23.730 --> 19:25.998
Anyone asks,
our plates got stolen

19:26.032 --> 19:28.167
and someone else
got those tickets.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.538
Uh [laughs]
an unmarked car?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.973
Now it's a road trip!
Yes!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.475
Let's go see
that peanut!

19:35.508 --> 19:37.544
Yes! Let's do it!
Let's go!

19:37.577 --> 19:39.346
And last,
just to be safe,

19:39.379 --> 19:41.814
I rubber-band these gauze pads
in my armpits

19:41.848 --> 19:43.149
to soak up the sweat.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.818
First we can't drink milk,
and now this.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.654
Asians got jobbed.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.489
Why did you never
tell me about this?

19:49.522 --> 19:52.259
I was going to when you were
old enough to start drinking.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.093
I guess I didn't realize
you were there.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.496
Yeah, well,
I learned my lesson.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.398
Your mom and I will take that
into consideration

19:58.431 --> 19:59.566
when we figure out
your punishment.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.068
Damn. [ Sighs ]

20:02.101 --> 20:04.704
Well, if it helps,
it wasn't planned.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.439
It just sort of happened.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.441
Honestly, this weekend
I was just hoping

20:08.475 --> 20:11.177
to sit around in our underwear
watching TV...

20:11.210 --> 20:12.512
Both:
Not brushing our teeth.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.713
[ Chuckles ]

20:13.746 --> 20:15.214
This all seems like
a lot of work

20:15.248 --> 20:16.716
for something
that tastes like garbage.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.184
Well, if you want
to talk about it,

20:18.217 --> 20:20.186
or anything else,
I'm here.

20:20.219 --> 20:24.123
I actually do have some
questions about kissing.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.726
How do you know
if you're good at it?

20:26.759 --> 20:29.228
Well, if she's anything
like your mother --

20:29.262 --> 20:31.197
You know what?
I'm not feeling so great.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.198
Maybe we can
talk more later.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.933
Whenever you want.

Come on.
Let's get the rest

20:35.101 --> 20:36.068
of the beers
and dump them out.

20:36.102 --> 20:37.404
Oh.
It was just the one.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.906
The five of you were going
to split one beer?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.374
It was all
he could afford.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.142
Trent paid his sister
60 bucks for it.

She said she
was losing money.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.388
Why do they have a swimming pool
at a police academy?

Don't start asking questions,
or it all falls apart.

Nope.

the chair.

Goodbye, Big Peanut.
