00:02.035 --> 00:03.737
( bell rings )

00:03.770 --> 00:06.072
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.106 --> 00:09.042
 <i>* I don't think</i>
 <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.075 --> 00:11.978
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.012 --> 00:15.415
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:15.448 --> 00:19.586
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.187 --> 00:24.224
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.257 --> 00:27.227
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.260 --> 00:30.130
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.163 --> 00:33.600
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

00:33.633 --> 00:38.004
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:51.985 --> 00:55.055
   <i>* It's all right</i>
   <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:55.088 --> 00:57.891
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:57.924 --> 01:01.528
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:17.177 --> 01:19.079
Welcome to
the mid-semester blues.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.847
  Not a single
  vacation in sight.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.351
   Next year, I'm asking
   for weekdays off.

01:24.384 --> 01:28.221
You guys, you guys!
Johnny,
limousine, now, school!

01:28.254 --> 01:31.491
Lisa, relax, you're going
to crack your make-up!

01:32.158 --> 01:34.127
 But him, hunk, here.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.429
Oh boy! Oh boy!
Oh boy!

01:36.463 --> 01:38.465
  What are you
  "oh boying" about?

01:38.498 --> 01:39.966
Johnny Dakota,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.169
  my favorite
  Hollywood hunk, he's here!

01:43.203 --> 01:45.972
 - Excuse me.
 - Oh boy! Bye, girl.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.943
 I think she's a fan.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.579
 - That would've been my guess.
 - Hey, Johnny Dakota.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.115
  I'm Zack Morris.
  I loved you in
  "Skateboard High."

01:55.115 --> 01:58.118
 Thanks, guy. Could you tell me
 how to get to
 the principal's office?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.387
Sure. Easy.
Moon a teacher.

02:02.555 --> 02:05.258
   The principal's
   office is right
   down the hall over there.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.861
 I'll take you, Johnny.
 It's like a second home to me.

02:07.894 --> 02:10.295
 When you did
 the skateboarding...

02:10.330 --> 02:12.465
   Hey, sorry, guy.
   You okay?

02:12.499 --> 02:14.067
  I'm fine, no thanks to you

02:14.067 --> 02:16.536
 and your wanton disregard
 for hallway courtesy.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.839
 Come on, no hard feelings.
 Name's Johnny Dakota.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.208
   Yeah, right,
   and I'm Madonna!

02:31.184 --> 02:32.852
( Zack coughs )

02:32.886 --> 02:35.121
 This is our principal, Mr.
 Belding.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.623
 Yes, may I help you?

02:36.656 --> 02:39.959
 Mr. Belding, I want you to
 meet a close friend of mine...
 Johnny Dakota.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.896
 Johnny, Dick;
 Dick, Johnny.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.132
   Guys, let's rap.

02:46.166 --> 02:50.503
 Johnny Dakota? What brings
 a big movie star
 like you to Bayside?

02:50.537 --> 02:52.105
   We're looking
   for a high school

02:52.105 --> 02:55.008
to tape an anti-drug
commercial for NBC TV.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.476
   Wow, NBC!

02:56.509 --> 02:59.112
  We'd like to use
  some of the students in it.

02:59.145 --> 03:02.182
 - This is my director,
 Dean Yoblonsky.
 - Yo.

03:03.483 --> 03:07.053
 It's certainly an honor
 that you've selected Bayside.

03:07.053 --> 03:09.389
 Actually, Bayside was
 just the first school we saw

03:09.422 --> 03:12.058
 when we got off the freeway.

03:12.092 --> 03:14.060
  Hey, freeway close!

03:14.060 --> 03:17.197
 Just one of
 the many advantages
 here at Bayside, right, Dick?

03:17.230 --> 03:19.265
   Good point, Zack.

03:19.299 --> 03:22.235
 We've got to
 look at a few other
 schools after we leave here.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.970
   Wait a moment.
   I can't let Johnny leave.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.572
   He's a big star.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.208
  Where there's a big star,
  there's lots of
  beautiful girls.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.210
   I gotta act fast.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.079
  Well, Johnny,
  that's the school.

03:33.079 --> 03:36.549
 Unless you want to go
 by the cafeteria again
 for some more good eating.

03:36.583 --> 03:40.220
   Thanks, Mr. Belding, but I'm
   still full from
   the Salisbury steak.

03:40.253 --> 03:43.390
   That wasn't steak.
   That was tapioca pudding.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.229
  So, shall I tell the students
  you'll shoot the commercial
  here at Bayside?

03:49.262 --> 03:51.364
   I still haven't decided,
   Mr. Belding.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.101
Oh yeah?
Then, let us help you.
Come on, guys.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.404
Hey, Bayside,
tell them who you are.

03:57.437 --> 04:00.040
 ( rap music playing )

04:00.040 --> 04:01.541
  Here we go!

04:01.574 --> 04:03.777
  <i>* We're Bayside students</i>
  <i>and we're no fools</i>

04:03.810 --> 04:05.478
   <i>* We don't use drugs</i>
   <i>'cause it's just not cool</i>

04:05.512 --> 04:06.880
   <i>* So if you get the offer</i>

04:06.913 --> 04:08.081
   <i>* Make sure you refuse</i>

04:08.114 --> 04:11.051
  <i>* When it comes to drugs</i>
  <i>just don't use! *</i>

04:17.957 --> 04:20.060
Do we have
school spirit or what?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.394
  That was pretty impressive.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.963
  Spirit is not all we have
  here at Bayside.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.132
 As class president
 and school newspaper editor,

04:26.166 --> 04:29.202
- let me tell you
more about Bayside.
- Sure.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.306
Is he here?
Is Johnny Dakota here?

04:33.340 --> 04:36.142
He might be shooting
an anti-drug
commercial at Bayside.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.411
 No way. He's my favorite actor
 in the whole world!

04:38.445 --> 04:40.880
Really? I'll introduce you.
We're buds.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.083
No, I can't.
I'd be too embarrassed.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.085
He's a big movie star.
What do I say?

04:45.118 --> 04:47.087
It's no big deal.
Just talk to him, girl.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.090
 I almost did.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.592
   You see, Bayside is not
   only strong academically,

04:52.625 --> 04:55.161
  but everyone here
  loves your movies.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.831
Gentlemen,
is Bayside your choice?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.432
  Yo!

04:59.466 --> 05:01.368
 - All: Yeah!
 - I'm still not sure.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.371
   Johnny,
   I want to introduce you
   to our head cheerleader,

05:04.404 --> 05:06.506
 - Kelly Kapowski.
 - Hi.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.508
Hello.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.181
   Mr. Belding, I definitely
   want to shoot at Bayside.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.785
- All right!
- Yeah!

05:18.818 --> 05:21.855
 This storyboard will show you
 how we shoot the commercial.

05:21.888 --> 05:23.857
   This is so neat!

05:23.890 --> 05:26.459
   Are you really
   going to pick students
   to be in the commercial?

05:26.493 --> 05:31.064
  Yeah,
  and as far as I'm concerned,
  you already have the part.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.234
- Me? Really?
- Yeah.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.369
  In fact, this is you here.

05:38.605 --> 05:41.841
  Except I'd say
  you have a few more curves.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.144
  Cut it out!

05:44.177 --> 05:46.479
 I bet you have
 a lot of boyfriends.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.815
   Well, not a lot.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.351
- How many?
- Well... none.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.420
Really?

05:53.453 --> 05:56.089
 You know, I don't have
 a girlfriend either.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.927
Oh boy!

06:01.027 --> 06:04.230
 Where have you been?
 I'm almost out of doorknobs
 touched by Johnny.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.066
  Don't worry, Zack,

06:06.099 --> 06:08.935
  I've got one
  pair of sunglasses
  complete with Johnny sweat.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.370
  All right!

06:10.403 --> 06:12.806
   Hot off the set,
   new Johnny Dakota props!

06:12.839 --> 06:14.407
  Come and get them!

06:14.441 --> 06:16.509
   Lisa: Items? Let me see!

06:16.543 --> 06:20.880
   I have here
   an actual pair of sunglasses
   worn by Johnny Dakota.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.050
Whoo,
Lisa, if you look closely,
you can see an eyelash.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.052
I've got to have them!

06:26.052 --> 06:28.254
- But I'm broke.
- Sorry, Lisa.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.056
  Cash only.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.926
Don't make me hurt you.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.528
  Take it, take it.
  It's yours.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.897
  Lucky for you,
  I'm a lady.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.869
 Get your Johnny Dakota
 souvenirs!

06:42.902 --> 06:45.071
   Johnny souvenirs?

06:45.105 --> 06:47.073
  Exploiting our guest, Zack?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.542
 We have a date in my office.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.144
  A date in your office, sir?

06:51.177 --> 06:54.881
  Actually, I prefer
  the drive-in movie.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.549
   Zack, you are
   in deep trouble.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.519
 You are not supposed
 to be making
 money off of Johnny!

06:59.552 --> 07:02.122
 It's okay, Mr. Belding.
 I gave Zack the okay

07:02.155 --> 07:05.125
 as long as the profits go
 to the Teen Drug Foundation.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.394
- Right, Zack?
- Uh...

07:07.427 --> 07:09.896
right, right.
Didn't I mention that?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.431
  Oh.

07:11.464 --> 07:16.036
Well, in that case,
keep buying, kids!
It's for a good cause!

07:18.204 --> 07:21.307
 - Thanks, Johnny.
 - It's okay.

07:21.341 --> 07:24.144
 You remind me a lot
 of someone I
 knew in high school.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.446
 - Really? Who?
 - Me.

07:26.479 --> 07:31.384
 I leased the school
 parking lot to a Chevy
 dealer on the weekends.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.387
 Here. See what you can
 get for this.

07:34.421 --> 07:37.791
 Hey, I'm gonna
 keep this for myself.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.929
   Hey, Slater, admit it,
   the guy is cool.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.831
  Why, because of
  his Hollywood hype?

07:44.864 --> 07:46.533
   He's no different
   than anyone else.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.269
  Hey, we all put pants on
  one leg at a time.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.071
We do?

07:52.305 --> 07:53.506
  ( sniffs )

07:53.540 --> 07:55.575
 I smell pot.
 You smell it?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.311
 Yeah.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.214
   Hey, look, it's a roach.

08:01.247 --> 08:04.918
 Slater, don't let it get away.
 My pet roach
 Herbert needs a wife!

08:07.020 --> 08:09.022
Someone's been getting
stoned in the bathroom.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.025
  Great! And we're about
  to shoot an anti-drug spot.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.527
 If Johnny finds out,
  it'll blow
 the whole commercial.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.830
 Don't let him see...

08:16.863 --> 08:18.798
  What's going on here, guys?

08:26.773 --> 08:28.775
   - We just found it.
   - I believe you.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.577
  ( exhales deeply )

08:30.610 --> 08:32.746
   I want to use you
   guys in the spot.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.080
- Really?
- Cool!

08:34.114 --> 08:37.717
 Absolutely. I need guys
 like you to help me
 get the message out.

08:37.751 --> 08:41.520
  - Both: Hey, deal!
  - We better get
  rid of this thing.

08:41.554 --> 08:44.256
 - I told you he
 was a great guy.
 - He's okay.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.461
   - See you, Johnny.
   - Oh man.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.662
   Okay, where's the roach?

08:49.696 --> 08:52.766
 Herbert wants to
 meet his bride to be.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.701
Sorry, Screech,
we flushed her.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.336
Sorry.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.171
You murderers!

08:59.572 --> 09:02.175
 You've committed insecticide!

09:04.177 --> 09:06.713
  Guys, I'd like to hear
  what you think about drugs.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.183
   - Screech, you go first.
   - I hate drugs.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.218
   But my doctor says
   I got to keep taking them

09:12.252 --> 09:16.122
if I want to get rid
of my post-nasal drip.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.592
 Screech, he's talking
 about illegal drugs,
 like pot, cocaine...

09:19.626 --> 09:21.327
 I don't know
 anything about those.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.364
One Twinkie,
and I'm out of control!

09:24.397 --> 09:26.332
 See, that's an honest answer.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.301
   Dumb, but honest.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.836
  You want to know
  about dumb?

09:29.869 --> 09:33.306
My brother used
drugs to get high
and drive to the beach.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.643
 Now I have to drive him.
 He's in a wheelchair.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.445
That kind of thing
happens a lot.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.714
 Remember Len Bias,
 the basketball star?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.583
  Had everything,
  including cocaine.

09:43.616 --> 09:46.419
One night, he had too much
and his heart stopped.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.888
   It's a shame too.
   He could have been great.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.257
   Same thing happened
   to John Belushi.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.294
  - Drugs wreck a lot of lives.
  - I just don't get it.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.863
 I don't know why people do it.

09:56.896 --> 10:00.300
 I had a problem with drugs
 that were legal.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.503
 I got hooked on
 caffeine pills,
 so I could stay up and study.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.239
Not only did I hurt myself,
I hurt my friends.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.208
  This is really good stuff.

10:08.241 --> 10:11.344
  I'll go find Dean so
  we can put it down on tape.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.480
Hey, yo, Dean!

10:13.513 --> 10:15.215
Hey, Blaze, let's roll!

10:15.248 --> 10:17.617
 The Leathershack
 has a special on dog collars.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.487
 - I want to get
 one for my mother.
 - Keep your chains on, Scud,

10:20.520 --> 10:22.789
   - I'm working on
   something here.
   - Oh. Oh.

10:22.822 --> 10:27.193
  Hey, I'll be in the bathroom
  giving some nerd a mohawk!

10:27.227 --> 10:30.864
  You guys, wasn't Scud leaving
  the bathroom when
  we found that joint?

10:30.897 --> 10:34.300
 That's right.
 I think we found our pothead.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.506
   All right, pally,
   up against the wall.
   Citizen's arrest!

10:39.539 --> 10:41.775
  You have the right
  to remain silent...

10:41.808 --> 10:44.344
   Relax.
   He's smoking a cigarette.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.813
 You have the right
 to punch my face in.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.716
 However, any bones
 you break will be used
 against you in a court of law.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.384
  ( growls )

10:51.418 --> 10:53.753
   Chill out, Scud.
We thought you
   were smoking pot.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.889
 - I'm not that stupid!
 - Oh yeah?

10:55.922 --> 10:58.758
 This can kill you too, genius.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.428
  Tell us about the pot
  we found in here yesterday.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.731
I don't know anything
about any pot!

11:04.764 --> 11:08.168
  I don't know why,
  but I believe him.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.769
 Look, Scud,
 we're sorry.

11:09.803 --> 11:13.673
  I guess we just got misguided
  by your thug-like exterior.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.442
  It happens.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.313
I can't believe I'm sharing
french fries
with Johnny Dakota.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.615
 Hey,
 we could've had a hamburger.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.484
 You know what I mean.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.886
  One week ago, I had
  this huge crush
  on a movie star...

11:26.920 --> 11:29.923
   - You had a crush on me?
   - No, Tom Cruise.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.326
Gotcha!

11:36.596 --> 11:40.300
  Lisa,
  why do I have to come along
  if you want to meet Johnny?

11:40.333 --> 11:44.571
   Because with you by my side,
   it will be easier
   for me to talk to him.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.141
 - Hello.
 - Hi.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.511
 Johnny, Lisa would like
 to ask you a few questions
 for her gossip column.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.214
   - Sure. Shoot, Lisa.
   - Thanks.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.485
So, Johnny, what are...
( stammers )

12:00.587 --> 12:02.322
 Okay.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.825
  What I mean is, how do you...
  ( laughs )

12:08.495 --> 12:10.363
  Jessie, ask the questions
  for me, please.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.333
  Pretty please, do it, Jessie.
  Thank you.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.737
 Lisa would rather
 I ask the questions instead.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.809
  ( softly )
  I can't ask these.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.881
- Do it.
- Okay.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.785
  "Do you sleep in pajamas?"

12:31.818 --> 12:33.887
 "Do you kiss on a first date?"

12:33.920 --> 12:35.588
 "Will you marry me?"

12:36.389 --> 12:38.792
  No, yes, and maybe.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.928
- ( gasps )
- That is,
if Kelly turns me down.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.635
   Johnny, stop.
   Lisa, don't write that.
   That's personal.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.804
Hey, Johnny,
I need a favor.

12:50.837 --> 12:54.641
 Mr. Belding is driving me
 crazy to get an autographed
 picture for his wife.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.710
Not a problem.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.245
- What should I write?
- I got it right here.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.447
 Okay.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.782
 "Dear Mrs. B,

13:02.816 --> 13:07.120
 You're lucky to be married
 to such a buff-looking hunk."

13:07.153 --> 13:10.190
   - Is he for real?
   - I'm afraid so.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.592
 - Thanks, Johnny.
 - No problem.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.395
 I want to
 invite you to a party
 at my house tonight.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.130
 In fact, everyone's invited.

13:17.163 --> 13:18.531
 - Hey!
 - All right!

13:18.565 --> 13:20.567
 Wow! My first Hollywood party.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.869
  I wonder if
  the Simpsons will be there.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.405
 ( pop music playing )

13:52.265 --> 13:55.335
  I have never seen so many
  great-looking girls

13:55.368 --> 13:57.270
   in one room
   in my whole entire life!

13:57.303 --> 13:59.506
  Get used to it.
  You're going to
  be here a lot more.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.708
   Johnny,
   your place is beautiful.

14:01.741 --> 14:05.178
   Especially with you here.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.614
  Johnny,
  we've been in town a week.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.750
   - You haven't come by.
   - We've missed you, baby.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.186
   I've been a little busy.
   This is Kelly.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.788
Martha, Ingrid.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.856
 Let me introduce you
 to my newest co-star

14:16.890 --> 14:19.492
  - Zack Morris.
  - Co-star!

14:22.562 --> 14:25.365
  Hey, Johnny, can't wait
  to start shooting tomorrow.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.800
 Tsk!

14:27.734 --> 14:29.836
  Hey, Preppie, why don't you

14:29.869 --> 14:32.472
 introduce me to
 your two friends? Wink, wink.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.608
- Sure.
Girls, this is AC Slater...
- Ladies.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.877
 ...my driver.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.746
Shouldn't he
be waiting in the car?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.448
Oh yes.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.387
Jessie, guess
who I just danced with!

14:47.420 --> 14:49.155
  - Who?
  - Storm Sutherland!

14:49.189 --> 14:51.925
  Storm Sutherland?
  I just danced
  with Luke Diamond.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.361
 Luke Diamond?
 Can you believe this?

14:54.394 --> 14:55.762
   Both: No!

14:55.795 --> 14:58.698
 - Aren't you glad we came?
 - Both: Yes!

15:02.168 --> 15:04.838
  Hey, Screech, why are you
  dressed like that?

15:04.871 --> 15:07.574
Johnny gave me some clothes
to wear while mine dry.

15:07.607 --> 15:11.211
 I had a little accident
 with the avocado dip.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.481
I can tell. There's still
guacamole in your ear.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.518
 - Hey there.
 - Hi.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.256
 Did anybody ever tell you
 you look like Johnny?

15:23.289 --> 15:25.125
  A lot of people
  make that mistake.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.260
 Actually,
 I'm his stunt double.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.497
Your arms are so firm.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.799
 That's my elbow. I work out.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.468
   ( clears throat )

15:35.502 --> 15:38.705
   Let's move over here
   before we catch
   this guy's cold.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.277
 Did you do that stunt
 in "Freeway Warrior"

15:44.310 --> 15:46.579
   where you jumped
   out of the exploding car?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.215
  Do it? Ha! It was my idea!

15:49.249 --> 15:51.184
 Watch, I'll show you.

15:52.686 --> 15:54.487
  Oh no, the car is on fire!

15:54.521 --> 15:56.222
  ( screams )

15:58.825 --> 16:01.161
Screech:
Slater, need your help!

16:01.728 --> 16:04.798
 I think it's my back.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.534
 - Oh man, you're hurt.
 - Better take you back home.

16:07.567 --> 16:11.171
 - Good idea.
 - Kelly, you can't leave yet.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.440
 I'm sure these guys can
 take care of Screech.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.242
 Oh yeah, you stay, Kelly,
 I'm all partied out.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.711
  ( screams )

16:18.378 --> 16:19.546
We'll help you.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.582
 Yeah, we might as well leave.
 Our hunks have already split.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.884
 Hey, Slater, I'll help you
 get him to the car.

16:24.918 --> 16:27.654
  Hey, Johnny,
  I'll be right back.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.889
Bye! Have a nice time!

16:34.294 --> 16:36.463
  Thanks for staying, Kelly.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.400
 Just wouldn't have been much
 of a party without you here.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.510
   Man: Hey, Johnny!

16:50.543 --> 16:53.380
   - Hey, guy!
   - You got some
   good stuff here.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.148
 Thanks, man.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.488
Here, Kell, take a hit.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.734
 - I don't think I want to.
 - Uh-oh, Johnny,

17:15.769 --> 17:18.038
   looks like she's
   "just saying no."

17:18.038 --> 17:19.906
   ( crowd laughs )

17:19.939 --> 17:22.608
 Hey, guys, I'm back.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.612
 - What's going on?
 - Nothing,
 Zack, let's go home.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.181
Stay! It's early.
Hey, Zack, want a hit?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.483
You smoke pot?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.752
 Yeah, sure.
 Who doesn't?

17:32.786 --> 17:35.655
   - I don't.
   - I don't either.

17:35.689 --> 17:37.791
   Come on.
   Are you serious?

17:37.824 --> 17:41.161
Yeah, we're serious.
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.130
  Hey, today is the big day.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.932
  Did you brush your
  teeth for those close-ups?

17:45.965 --> 17:47.534
  Johnny, we've got to talk.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.669
 We'll talk later.
 No time. We've got...

17:49.703 --> 17:52.806
 Shooting this commercial
 doesn't seem right after
 what happened last night.

17:52.839 --> 17:54.207
 It was a great party,
 wasn't it?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.509
   Come on, you know
   what I mean.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.078
   Come on, give me a break.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.412
   It was just a little pot.

17:59.446 --> 18:02.482
 How can you smoke pot
 last night and tell them
 not to do it today?

18:02.515 --> 18:05.018
 What I do at
 home is my business.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.786
  Come on, buddy, lighten up.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.588
  And I thought
  you were real cool.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.824
 A million other kids still do,
 but you know what?

18:10.857 --> 18:13.193
  - We were wrong.
  - What do you want from me?

18:13.226 --> 18:16.763
- Don't do this commercial.
- Forget it, friend.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.498
 No...

18:18.531 --> 18:20.533
 I'm not your friend.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.169
   All right, guys,
   let's go!

18:23.203 --> 18:25.772
 Let's make
 some Bayside history!

18:27.741 --> 18:30.543
 Hey, Dean, here's your star.

18:30.577 --> 18:34.047
 - So did you talk to Johnny?
- Yeah,
 but he wouldn't listen to me.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.517
  Okay, hold the talk.
  Places, people.
  We've got a spot to shoot.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.086
  Come on, Zack.
  You're over here beside me.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.655
   Sorry... I can't do this.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.158
   - Me neither.
   - I'm with them.

18:47.227 --> 18:51.164
  You know, when I wanted
  to talk to you, I couldn't.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.967
   Now that I can,
   I don't want to.

18:57.671 --> 18:59.506
  Ditto for me, bub.

18:59.539 --> 19:03.009
  Tonight, all my Johnny Dakota
  action figures
  become lawn mulch.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.514
Hey, hey, hey,
what is going on here?

19:07.547 --> 19:11.184
  Let them go.
  We'll just give
  the lines to Kelly.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.019
   Goodbye, Johnny.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.721
 Fine!

19:14.754 --> 19:16.656
   I don't need
   this aggravation.

19:16.690 --> 19:18.591
   In fact,
   I don't need your school!

19:18.625 --> 19:22.929
- I'm out of here!
- Johnny, don't leave!

19:23.029 --> 19:25.432
 We just felt it was wrong
 to be a part of his lie, sir.

19:25.465 --> 19:27.567
We weren't just
thinking of ourselves.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.136
 Bayside's integrity
 would have been compromised.

19:30.170 --> 19:33.773
 You did the right thing.
 I am very proud of you guys.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.609
 I guess this
 means NBC won't be
 shooting the commercial here.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.911
Bummer.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.713
   Hold on a minute.

19:39.746 --> 19:43.183
  I know somebody at NBC
  that just might
  be able to help us.

19:44.651 --> 19:48.054
 Hi, I'm Brandon Tartikoff,
 chairman of NBC Entertainment,

19:48.088 --> 19:51.524
   and I've got a hit idea
   for the new fall season:

19:51.558 --> 19:53.927
Don't do drugs.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.063
  There's no hope with dope.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.132
Cut!
That was great!

20:00.700 --> 20:03.069
 Brandon, thanks for letting us
 do the commercial.

20:03.103 --> 20:05.839
   The least I could do
   for the man who
   changed my life.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.141
 - Get out of here.
 - It's true!

20:08.174 --> 20:10.777
  How could Mr. Belding have
  possibly changed your life?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.178
 Well, I'll tell you.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.515
 When we were growing up
 together, I wanted to go
 into show business,

20:15.548 --> 20:18.051
   and Brandon wanted to be
   a high school principal.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.953
 Back then, Dick and I
 were chasing

20:19.986 --> 20:23.723
   after the same girl...
   Becky Floogelman.

20:23.757 --> 20:26.893
  Dick won her.
  She was the school
  superintendent's daughter.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.928
He got to become
the principal,

20:28.962 --> 20:31.698
   and I had to settle
   for running NBC.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.733
It worked out great
for both of us.

20:33.767 --> 20:37.537
 Maybe for you.
 I don't get the summers off.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.675
 Besides, I really envy you
 being around these great
 kids all the time.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.977
 Come back and visit any time.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.546
You know, maybe
there's something here.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.984
 Maybe at NBC, we should
 do a sitcom about a school
 principal and his kids.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.519
Really?

20:52.552 --> 20:55.121
Nah, it'll never work.

20:55.155 --> 20:58.725
- Playback coming
over the monitors.
- Let's watch.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.464
  ( beeping )

21:07.967 --> 21:09.169
 Dumb.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.638
Stupid.

21:12.072 --> 21:13.540
Crazy.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.974
  Dangerous.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.210
Stinks.

21:17.243 --> 21:19.879
   In one word,
   would I use dope?

21:19.913 --> 21:21.648
 Nope.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.551
 These kids are right.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.754
   Drugs will hurt your mind,
   your body and your life.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.591
 Hi, I'm Brandon Tartikoff,
 chairman of NBC Entertainment,

21:31.624 --> 21:34.561
   and I've got a hit idea
   for the new fall season:

21:34.594 --> 21:37.263
Don't do drugs.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.733
  There's no hope with dope.

21:46.006 --> 21:48.508
( instrumental
theme music plays )
