00:02.135 --> 00:04.262
You can tell the best year
of your father's life.

00:05.605 --> 00:09.006
Because they freeze that clothing style
and just ride it out to the end.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.166
It's not like they don't
continue shopping.

00:11.344 --> 00:14.006
It's just they somehow manage
to find new old clothes.

00:14.381 --> 00:17.043
Every father is like
this fashion time capsule.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.276
It's like they should be
on a pedestal...

00:19.452 --> 00:22.853
...with someone next to them going,
"This was 1965."

00:23.423 --> 00:25.414
To me, the worst thing
is shopping for pants.

00:25.592 --> 00:27.184
I hate undressing
in the little room.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.056
What men need is a place
to shop where you go in...

00:30.230 --> 00:33.825
...check your pants at the door
and walk around in your underwear.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.969
That would be best. Then you'd
really have to lie to the salesman.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.503
"Need some help?"
"No, just getting some air."

00:45.311 --> 00:48.212
How would you describe
the smell in this house?

00:48.815 --> 00:50.612
Dandruff?

00:51.151 --> 00:53.984
Yeah, that's part of it. Kasha?

00:55.321 --> 00:58.848
-There's some kasha.
-Yeah. Dandruff, kasha, mothballs...

00:59.025 --> 01:00.959
...cheap carpeting.
It's potpourri, really.

01:02.128 --> 01:04.358
-All right, let's go. Come on.
-You're going?

01:04.531 --> 01:08.058
Yeah. We shouldn't have bowled
that last game. I'm gonna be late.

01:08.435 --> 01:09.902
These aren't candies, are they?

01:11.071 --> 01:14.097
Did you use those?
These are guest soaps.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.003
Well, I'm a guest.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.640
Now my parents are gonna know
I had people over.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.006
You're not allowed?

01:20.180 --> 01:23.081
I can't have any parties
while they're out of town.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.046
This is a party?

01:25.218 --> 01:28.676
Not anymore. Come on, get your ball.
We're leaving. Let's go.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.223
-Who put this cup on the new table?
-I was having coffee.

01:33.393 --> 01:36.089
-I put it on the coffee table.
-But you didn't use a coaster!

01:36.262 --> 01:38.025
You left a stain!

01:39.299 --> 01:41.563
Whoa, boy, there's always one
at every party, huh?

01:41.734 --> 01:43.827
Come on.

01:44.003 --> 01:46.437
-What's the big rush?
-I'm having people over.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.801
-Who?
-The girls, for poker night.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.466
You know, Joanne, Renee, Winona...

01:51.644 --> 01:53.111
Winona's gonna be there?

01:53.513 --> 01:55.708
Yeah. And she broke up
with the vitamin guy.

01:55.882 --> 01:58.646
-Really?
-I'll put in a good word for you.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.877
Thanks. Because
I would really like...

02:01.087 --> 02:04.181
-All right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-This not coming out.

02:04.357 --> 02:07.884
-Just put a coffee-table book over it.
-My parents don't read.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.187
They'll wonder what a book
is doing on the table.

02:10.363 --> 02:13.730
Hey. You know what would make
a great coffee-table book?

02:13.900 --> 02:16.994
A coffee-table book
about coffee tables.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.270
Get it?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.498
-Got it. Come on, let's go.
-Wait. Not so fast.

02:22.675 --> 02:25.075
Jerry, you gotta take me
to get this thing refinished.

02:25.245 --> 02:27.236
-Now?
-Yes, now. It'll take a few days...

02:27.413 --> 02:30.075
...and my parents will be back.
I gotta have it before then.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.613
Jerry, you promised
you'd get me home by 7.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.219
-We'll take the subway.
-That'll get you home in time.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.856
-The subway? From Queens?
-Jerry, I'm gonna get my coat.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.049
I'm sorry, Elaine,
I'll make it up to you.

02:40.226 --> 02:42.592
I need something to read
on the subway.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.492
-Here, read this.
-<i>TV Guide</i> ?

02:48.067 --> 02:52.970
Like a history of coffee tables.
Celebrities and their coffee tables.

02:53.139 --> 02:57.007
It's a natural. This is a story
that must be told.

02:57.577 --> 02:59.704
So you're gonna talk to your boss
about it, huh?

02:59.879 --> 03:02.347
-First thing in the morning.
-Yes indeed.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.848
-<i>Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.</i>
-Queensborough Plaza.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.483
This stop is famous for its gyros.
You want one?

03:09.822 --> 03:12.518
How will you get something
and get back on the train in time?

03:12.692 --> 03:15.058
Well, they got a stand right out
on the platform.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.219
The gyros are cooked, wrapped
and ready to go.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.456
Three dollars, no change.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.259
-You want one?
-No, thanks.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.664
All right. But no bites.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.939
Highlighter?

03:32.111 --> 03:34.204
-Excuse me?
-To highlight the programs...

03:34.380 --> 03:36.348
...you plan to watch.

03:36.950 --> 03:41.284
-Look, really, I'm just trying to read.
-Fine, okay.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.150
It's just I've never seen...

03:44.324 --> 03:47.384
...a beautiful lady
reading the <i>Guide</i>...

03:48.895 --> 03:51.955
...so far away from a TV.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.399
You must really like television.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.828
Elaine!

04:03.843 --> 04:06.778
Guess your boyfriend
will have to catch the next train.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.777
-He's not my boyfriend.
-He's not?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.417
Interesting.

04:16.889 --> 04:18.857
Maybe I should get
Elaine something.

04:19.058 --> 04:21.026
-Why?
-Well, I didn't drive her home.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.185
Plus, I give her a gift
in front of Winona...

04:23.363 --> 04:25.957
...how does that hurt me?
-Can't hurt you.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.391
What about this thing?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.570
The Indian?

04:31.738 --> 04:33.797
Yeah, you know,
kind of a peace offering.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.702
It's cute.

04:35.875 --> 04:39.675
Well, I can have the table ready
for you on Monday.

04:39.846 --> 04:42.007
All right, but no later.
My parents are coming back.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.477
They left you home alone, huh?

04:50.023 --> 04:54.255
Okay, see,
on this particular Tuesday...

04:55.228 --> 04:59.358
...you could have watched
six hours of Lucy.

05:00.099 --> 05:03.398
There's <i>I Love Lucy</i>...

05:03.569 --> 05:06.299
...<i>The Lucy Show</i>...

05:06.472 --> 05:08.406
...<i>Here's Lucy</i>.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.312
It's my stop.

05:15.848 --> 05:17.679
Bye-bye.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.610
Hey, miss, you forgot this.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:29.929 --> 05:33.194
They don't make these anymore.
The work is all done by hand.

05:33.366 --> 05:35.926
It takes years and years. Sylvia.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.332
For crying out loud,
you're 45 minutes late.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.199
Yeah, yeah.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.671
Is that your car out there?

05:43.776 --> 05:46.301
-No, it's his.
-Oh, nice.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.674
You guys are obviously
from Manhattan.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.884
Well, he is. I live around the corner.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.417
Really?

05:54.620 --> 05:57.748
I didn't think any cool guys
lived in this neighborhood.

05:59.592 --> 06:01.457
Well, they do now.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.422
The neighborhood's changing.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.896
-All right, I'll take it.
-Smart choice.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.731
You bought the Indian?
Oh, you guys have great taste.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.872
Well, we're collectors.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.905
We see objects of great beauty...

06:19.011 --> 06:20.740
...and we must have them.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.321
Bluffed you out, jack. Pair of deuces.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.894
-Who is it?
-It's Jerry.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.965
-Jerry.
-Surprise!

06:43.369 --> 06:44.893
What is this?

06:45.071 --> 06:48.302
Well, I felt bad about this afternoon,
so I got you something.

06:48.474 --> 06:51.238
Oh, you did?
Do you guys all know Jerry?

06:51.511 --> 06:53.604
-Hi, Jerry.
-Hi. Hi, Winona.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.005
Nice to see you again.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.409
-Elaine, is it your birthday?
-No.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.519
I don't need a reason to give gifts.

07:01.687 --> 07:04.713
It's my nature.
I love to make people happy.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.325
Oh, that is so sweet.

07:07.493 --> 07:08.960
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.767
It's a cigar-store Indian.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.133
Read the card.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.438
That's very nice.
Thank you very much.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.378
-Read it out loud.
-I don't think so.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.108
We had a little fight this afternoon.

07:34.287 --> 07:38.223
"Let's bury the hatchet.
We smokem peace pipe."

07:38.391 --> 07:40.450
You know, it's late.
I really should go.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.254
I don't blame you, Winona. I...

07:50.703 --> 07:54.605
Are you out of your mind?

07:54.874 --> 07:56.273
It's kitschy.

07:56.542 --> 08:00.069
Winona is a Native American.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.472
She is?

08:05.184 --> 08:08.085
You've got very unusual taste.

08:09.755 --> 08:11.655
I hope prune juice is all right.

08:15.628 --> 08:19.155
-It's the only thing that was chilled.
-Oh, that's fine.

08:19.332 --> 08:22.495
I'm sorry about that lock
on the liquor cabinet.

08:22.668 --> 08:26.160
The combination must have
just flown out of my head.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.000
It's a mental block.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.268
Is this your son
in the bubble bath?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.903
No, that's me.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.448
You don't see too many guys
your age...

08:37.616 --> 08:40.552
...who keep baby pictures
of themselves around.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.210
I like it.

08:42.388 --> 08:45.482
It's consistent with the rest
of the house.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.591
Yes, it is consistent.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.160
I've tried to maintain a consistent feel
throughout the house.

08:51.330 --> 08:55.130
-What is this we're listening to?
-The Ray Conniff Singers.

08:59.605 --> 09:02.506
What's that smell? Kasha?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.945
It's a potpourri. May I..?

09:08.447 --> 09:11.041
May I show you
the master bedroom?

09:13.920 --> 09:17.048
-<i>Who is it?</i>
-Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

09:18.257 --> 09:19.690
Yeah?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.421
<i>Listen, I really felt bad
about what happened.</i>

09:22.595 --> 09:24.961
I'd really like to apologize.
Could I come up?

09:25.398 --> 09:26.990
I'll come down.

09:29.602 --> 09:32.036
-I came by to get my ball.
-It's right over there.

09:32.204 --> 09:33.535
Yeah, thanks.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.469
Yeah, it's got the magic grip.

09:35.641 --> 09:38.075
How do you think
I bowled that 220 today, huh?

09:38.444 --> 09:39.843
Yo.

09:40.613 --> 09:43.548
-Where did this come from?
-Do you want it?

09:43.849 --> 09:45.544
-I can have this?
-Yeah.

09:45.718 --> 09:49.484
-You wanna lug it uptown, it's yours.
-Oh, I'll lug.

09:50.990 --> 09:53.254
It's just that it's
a very sensitive issue for me.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.623
And well it should be. I think
if you spent any time with me at all...

09:56.796 --> 09:59.594
...you'd see I'm very sensitive
to these matters as well.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.926
You wouldn't be hungry
by any chance, would you?

10:02.101 --> 10:03.261
I could go for a bite.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.303
Do you like Chinese food?
I went to a Szechwan restaurant...

10:06.472 --> 10:09.032
...in this neighborhood.
I don't remember the address.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.768
Excuse me, you must know
where the Chinese restaurant is.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.844
Why must I know?
Because I'm Chinese?

10:14.013 --> 10:16.607
You think I know where
all the Chinese restaurants are?

10:16.782 --> 10:19.945
Oh, ask honorable Chinaman
for location of restaurant.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.213
I thought because you're the mailman
you would know the neighborhood.

10:23.389 --> 10:28.452
Oh, hello, <i>American Joe</i>, which way
to hamburger/hot-dog stand?

10:29.895 --> 10:31.886
-I didn't know...
-You know what, it's late.

10:32.064 --> 10:34.624
-I should probably just go home.
-I had no idea...

10:35.368 --> 10:37.836
Hey, Jerry, look what I got.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.906
He...

10:54.987 --> 10:56.818
-Looks pretty good.
-Yeah, did a good job.

10:56.989 --> 11:00.186
-I don't think they'll be able to tell.
-You know, I don't get it.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.920
I'm not allowed to ask a Chinese
person where a Chinese restaurant is?

11:04.096 --> 11:06.690
I mean, aren't we all getting
a little too sensitive?

11:06.866 --> 11:10.358
Somebody asks me which way
is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.940
-Anyway, what's the status with..?
-Well, she kind of calmed down.

11:19.111 --> 11:20.601
I'm gonna see her tonight.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.975
-Oh, great.
-Yeah. But I'm a little uncomfortable.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.174
-I'm afraid to make another mistake.
-Come on.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.613
Hello, hello.

11:27.653 --> 11:30.247
-Hey, you're home.
-Hello, Georgie.

11:32.825 --> 11:35.259
-The house looks very nice.
-Yeah, huh?

11:35.428 --> 11:36.952
-Where's the mail?
-Hello, Jerry.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.892
-Hello.
-So how was the trip?

11:39.065 --> 11:40.532
Oh, your father.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.069
Is there anything wrong with
getting a receipt at a tollbooth?

11:46.639 --> 11:48.607
I'm going upstairs.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.902
This stack should be bigger.
Where's the <i>TV Guide</i> ?

11:54.780 --> 11:57.647
-What <i>TV Guide</i> ?
-I'm missing <i>TV Guide</i>.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.479
Volume 41, number 31.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.618
Elaine took it to read
on the subway.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.020
-Elaine took it?
-I didn't know she took it.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.455
Well, it's two weeks old.

12:08.627 --> 12:10.595
How could you let her take
the <i>TV Guide</i> ?!

12:10.963 --> 12:12.828
He collects them.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.261
You collect <i>TV Guide</i> ?

12:17.436 --> 12:18.698
The nerve of that woman.

12:18.871 --> 12:21.738
Walking into my house,
stealing my collectibles.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.966
Oh, my God!

12:24.710 --> 12:27.577
This was in our bed.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.112
What is this?

12:29.281 --> 12:30.976
A prophylactic rubber?

12:37.089 --> 12:40.081
What is this doing on my bed?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.691
I don't know.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.464
I'll see you later.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.441
You were having sex on our bed?

13:00.813 --> 13:02.212
Yes.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.543
Who told you you could have sex
in our bed?

13:06.719 --> 13:10.120
-Well, my bed is too small.
-Your bed is too small?

13:10.289 --> 13:13.019
I'm gone two weeks,
and you turn our house...

13:13.192 --> 13:15.319
...into Bourbon Street?

13:15.661 --> 13:17.094
Where am I going to sleep?

13:18.063 --> 13:20.691
-What are you talking about?
-I can't sleep in there.

13:20.866 --> 13:22.959
-Of course you can.
-I can't.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.966
I can't!

13:28.007 --> 13:29.406
That's it.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.304
You're grounded.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.415
You can't ground me.
I'm a grown man.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.079
You wanna live here...

13:40.252 --> 13:43.983
...you respect the rules of our house.
You're grounded!

13:46.992 --> 13:48.755
So where are we gonna go eat?

13:48.928 --> 13:50.725
I thought we'd eat
at the Gentle Harvest.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.955
I love that place,
but it's usually so crowded.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.930
-Can we get a table?
-Oh, don't worry. I made reser...

13:58.370 --> 14:00.338
-You made what?
-I...

14:00.906 --> 14:04.239
I arranged for the appropriate
accommodations.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.477
And then...

14:09.215 --> 14:12.207
...Knick tickets. Floor seats.

14:12.384 --> 14:16.047
-How did you get these?
-Got them on the street from a scal...

14:18.357 --> 14:19.756
From who?

14:22.161 --> 14:23.992
One of those guys.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.364
-What guys?
-You know, the guys...

14:26.532 --> 14:29.126
...that they sell the tickets
to the sold-out events.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.327
Wait a second. You've got
the Mark McEwen <i>TV Guide</i>.

14:32.771 --> 14:36.207
-That's Al Roker.
-They're both chubby weathermen.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.538
I get Dom DeLuise
and Paul Prudhomme mixed up too.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.441
-Could I have this?
-Sure, take it.

14:41.614 --> 14:42.876
Thanks.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.779
So Winona had the <i>TV Guide</i>.
Told you I'd make it up to you.

14:47.486 --> 14:50.250
-Mr. Costanza was pretty mad, huh?
-Yeah.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.913
You almost ruined his life's work.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.520
-He collects these?
-Yeah.

15:00.799 --> 15:03.597
All right, well, I will personally
go out to Queens...

15:03.769 --> 15:07.034
...and deliver his Al Roker
<i>TV Guide</i> to him.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.071
What did you do
with the one you took?

15:09.475 --> 15:10.965
I don't know.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.851
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.988
Yeah. Elaine, what did..?
What did he say, huh?

15:23.155 --> 15:25.783
-What did who say?
-Your boss.

15:25.958 --> 15:28.586
Didn't you tell him
about the coffee-table book?

15:31.463 --> 15:36.264
-Yeah, you didn't tell him, did you?
-Kramer, it is such a dumb idea.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.528
-I'd be totally embarrassed...
-Wait a minute...

15:38.704 --> 15:42.140
-I would be embarrassed to bring it up.
-I thought it was a pretty good idea.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.435
It's about coffee tables,
it's on a coffee table.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.706
Yeah, right. And on the cover
is a built-in coaster.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.176
-All right, I'm gonna go.
-Where are you going?

15:54.353 --> 15:57.789
I'm gonna go to the cigar stores.
I'm gonna see if I can sell that Indian.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.118
-My Indian?
-I think it's worth something.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.919
It's kitschy.

16:07.199 --> 16:12.535
How do you just walk into a house
and take a <i>TV Guide</i> ?

16:14.239 --> 16:17.208
How does she expect you
to watch TV?

16:17.409 --> 16:19.843
Am I just supposed to turn it on...

16:20.079 --> 16:23.571
...and wander aimlessly
around the dial?

16:25.384 --> 16:27.818
Hello. Is Elaine home?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.420
Elaine Benes?

16:29.621 --> 16:31.555
Oh, she's my son's friend.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.987
And she's not welcome
in this house.

16:34.760 --> 16:38.787
Because I made her
this very special gift, okay?

16:38.964 --> 16:42.695
It's a bouquet of paper
from her <i>TV Guide</i>.

16:42.868 --> 16:45.894
That's my <i>TV Guide</i>,
ripped to shreds!

16:46.071 --> 16:48.266
-She gave that to you?
-Hey...

16:48.440 --> 16:51.671
...is that <i>The Twilight Zone</i>
you're watching?

16:52.378 --> 16:56.280
-Yeah.
-Oh, this is a good one.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.712
<i>Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.</i>

17:02.421 --> 17:03.854
<i>Gyro.</i>

17:17.169 --> 17:19.729
I like your place.
It's very unassuming.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.169
Well, why would I assume?
I never assume.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.332
It leads to assumptions.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.977
Oh, by the way, that <i>TV Guide</i>
I gave you, I need it back.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.042
-Why?
-I'm doing a report...

17:30.215 --> 17:33.514
...on minorities in the media, and I
wanted to use the Al Roker interview.

17:33.685 --> 17:36.711
It's too late. I gave it to Elaine
to give to George's father.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.881
Jerry, I really need it back.
It is mine.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.859
You can't give something and then
take it back. I mean, what are you, a..?

17:45.597 --> 17:46.894
What?

17:47.966 --> 17:51.595
-A person that...
-A person that what?

17:51.770 --> 17:54.796
Well, a person that gives something
and then they're dissatisfied...

17:54.973 --> 17:58.067
...and they wish they had never
given it to the person...

17:58.243 --> 18:02.509
...that they originally gave it to.
-You mean, like an Indian giver?

18:02.748 --> 18:05.080
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar
with that term.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.501
I like the special fall preview issues
the best.

18:26.472 --> 18:29.305
Those. I've been saving those
from the beginning.

18:31.143 --> 18:33.873
These are worth, like,
a lot of money.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.441
-Oh, hello, Elaine.
-Hello.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.449
Elaine. Hello.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.118
You look scrumptious.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.515
Why'd you take my <i>TV Guide</i> ?

18:47.693 --> 18:51.322
I'm so sorry about that,
Mr. Costanza. But look, look.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.796
-I brought you another one.
-I made this for you.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.958
Thank you.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.002
What is this?
You got stains all over it.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.764
What the hell did you do?

19:02.007 --> 19:05.841
-Hey, you can't talk to her like that.
-I'll talk to her any way I want.

19:06.011 --> 19:07.672
Come on, Elaine. Let's go.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.240
My coffee table!

19:12.985 --> 19:16.785
I don't understand. How can you have
a cigar store without an Indian?

19:16.955 --> 19:18.547
It's unseemly.

19:18.724 --> 19:21.522
-I'll give you a box of coronas for it.
-Forget it.

19:21.693 --> 19:25.185
Excuse me, are you selling
this Indian?

19:25.364 --> 19:28.527
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-I'm just redecorating my office...

19:28.700 --> 19:31.396
...in a southwestern motif,
and this would be perfect.

19:31.570 --> 19:34.539
-Give you $500 for it?
-Giddyup.

19:34.706 --> 19:37.607
Yeah? Could you help me
bring it up to my office?

19:37.776 --> 19:39.903
I'm right next door.
Pendant Publishing.

19:40.579 --> 19:44.379
Pendant Publishing.
Giddyup again.

19:47.219 --> 19:50.382
Mr. Lippman, I'm sorry.
I was in Queens...

19:51.156 --> 19:53.556
-Kramer.
-Yeah. Hi, Elaine.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.587
What are you doing
in here with that?

19:55.761 --> 19:58.195
Well, it's a business transaction.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.025
Listen, petty cash
just had 10s and 20s.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.031
-Go ahead. Count it.
-Yeah.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.193
I'm sure it's all here.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.998
I was just admiring
your coffee table out in the hall.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.640
You like that, huh?

20:09.808 --> 20:11.708
I had that custom-made
for me in Santa Fe.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.971
-You mind if I use it in my book?
-What book?

20:15.147 --> 20:18.207
Well, I'm doing a coffee-table book
on coffee tables.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.249
About coffee tables?

20:21.420 --> 20:23.320
That's fantastic.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.421
-Who's your publisher?
-I'm still shopping it around.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.419
Yeah? You see?

20:28.594 --> 20:32.257
This is the kind of idea
you should be coming in with.

20:32.431 --> 20:35.764
What the hell do you do
around here all day anyway?

20:35.934 --> 20:41.668
-Well, I read manuscripts...
-The Indian really completes the room.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.569
Don't you think?

20:47.446 --> 20:50.643
I know this coffee table.
It's George Costanza's.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.579
It's mine. I'm his mother.

20:52.951 --> 20:56.478
Oh, I haven't seen George for a while.
He must be working very hard.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.486
George doesn't work.

20:58.657 --> 21:00.386
He's a bum.

21:01.059 --> 21:03.254
That's why he lives at home with us.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.086
He does?

21:06.932 --> 21:09.867
I don't know why we think of this.
We just could call <i>TV Guide</i>.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.434
I don't know.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.037
Well, it's going to make
Mr. Costanza very happy.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.740
I guess.

21:15.907 --> 21:18.501
-What's the matter?
-What do you think is the matter?

21:18.677 --> 21:22.636
I've been assigned to work
on Kramer's coffee-table book.

21:22.848 --> 21:25.112
It is a good idea, Elaine.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.718
<i>Next stop, Queensborough Plaza.</i>

21:27.886 --> 21:30.150
-Do you want a gyro?
-I don't think so.

21:35.694 --> 21:37.286
Elaine!

21:39.197 --> 21:42.462
Well, I guess your boyfriend's
gonna have to catch the next train.

21:42.801 --> 21:45.895
-He's not my boyfriend.
-He's not?

21:46.071 --> 21:47.595
Interesting.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.588
I was always excited as a kid when
that new <i>TV Guide</i> would come.

22:04.756 --> 22:06.587
When that front cover
is nice and flat...

22:06.758 --> 22:09.454
...it seems like there's
good, fresh TV shows.

22:09.628 --> 22:12.096
Then as the week goes by,
you start to hate the TV.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.824
All the shows stink.
Everything's getting all crumpled...

22:15.000 --> 22:17.560
...and ripped from being sat on,
thrown across the room.

22:17.736 --> 22:20.296
<i>TV Guide</i>'s always thrown,
never handed to another person.

22:20.505 --> 22:23.201
It's the world's most thrown
reading material.

22:23.375 --> 22:26.344
"Where's the <i>TV Guide</i> ?"
"There it is."

22:27.512 --> 22:29.912
In the back of the <i>TV Guide</i>,
they have a phone number.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.676
Ninety-five cents a minute,
they'll give you the answers...

22:32.851 --> 22:35.581
...to the <i>TV Guide</i>
crossword puzzle.

22:36.421 --> 22:39.322
My question is if you can't do
the <i>TV Guide</i> crossword puzzle...

22:39.491 --> 22:42.585
...where are you coming
across 95 cents?
