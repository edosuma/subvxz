00:00.520 --> 00:02.610
-mom?
-yes.

00:02.610 --> 00:05.020
Oh,god.You will never believe what he's gone and done now.

00:05.020 --> 00:06.720
He's remarrying his first wife 

00:06.720 --> 00:10.780
and he's taking the kids on a 1-month honeymoon to--wait for it--europe.

00:10.780 --> 00:14.290
Oh,honey.I stopped watching those trashy soap operas in 1982.

00:14.290 --> 00:16.890
Joe,mom.My trashy soap opera.

00:16.890 --> 00:19.580
The one that is my life.

00:20.070 --> 00:23.960
Well,change is always difficult,but change is like the wind.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.720
It's inevitable,and you can't hold it back.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.170
Did you just hear what I said,mom?Joe is remarrying his first wife.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.710
You know how that makes me feel?

00:31.710 --> 00:35.650
I was a pit stop on their highway to eternal happiness.

00:35.650 --> 00:38.180
Well,we must not turn these things inward.

00:38.180 --> 00:41.890
It is not always about us.Many times they reflect a more universal-- 

00:41.890 --> 00:44.810
who are you,and what have you done with my mother?

00:44.810 --> 00:48.830
Oh,I'm right here.I just got these very wise books,that's all.

00:48.830 --> 00:51.950
You've been browsing the self-help section again.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.270
Well,what do you suggest?

00:54.270 --> 00:57.550
My--my son has disappeared,and I'm desperate.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.510
-Are they helping?
-No.

00:59.510 --> 01:02.240
And since when does joe get the kids for that long?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.860
Well,he doesn't unless I agree to it.

01:03.860 --> 01:05.540
You know what really annoys me,mom?

01:05.540 --> 01:09.530
Is that he can suddenly afford a 1-month honeymoon in europe.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.950
-Who knew that joe was just one stupid...
-hey,mom.

01:11.950 --> 01:14.300
"Washin' and dryin'" jingle away from-- 

01:14.300 --> 01:16.230
wait a second?Joe wrote that?

01:16.230 --> 01:17.930
I love that song.Mom,you've heard that.

01:17.930 --> 01:24.190
I'm not washin' and dryin',so stop screamin' and cryin' start spinnin'and grinnin' with twirl 

01:24.190 --> 01:27.090
yeah,I can't believe you let him go.The guy's a musical genius,sarah.

01:27.090 --> 01:29.930
Really?Well,maybe when he puts out his first album,

01:29.930 --> 01:32.470
you could buy it for your girlfriend and you could-- 

01:32.470 --> 01:34.690
oh,no,that's right.She dumped you.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.130
That's not funny.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.430
-In fact,that actually hurts me a little bit,sarah.
-All right,that's enough.That's enough.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.810
Okay,okay,okay.I gotta get back to work anyway and 

01:40.810 --> 01:47.110
continue pnning what we are now optimistically referring to as a unity party.

01:48.260 --> 01:50.490
Mom?

01:50.490 --> 01:52.090
I told you about it.

01:52.090 --> 01:54.150
Sarah,I'm sorry.I'm not gonna come.

01:54.150 --> 01:56.720
-Wait a second.This is optional?
-No,it is not optional.

01:56.720 --> 02:01.080
-Mom-- 
-look,sarah,I am so glad you went back to ojai.I really am.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.320
But honestly,I don't feel compelled to celebrate happiness and unity

02:05.320 --> 02:08.530
as if everything is hunky-dory and no one has a clue where tommy is.

02:08.530 --> 02:12.330
-Mom,we all miss him.
-Of course,but we can't put our lives on hold.

02:12.330 --> 02:15.050
This is about solidifying the transition,

02:15.050 --> 02:19.110
and I will be extremely disappointed if you choose not to support me.

02:19.110 --> 02:20.410
yeah,me,too.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.810
Well,I'm sorry,both of you.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.100
I can't do it.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.320
Hey,I didn't see you this morning.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.140
Um,I had to leave early.

02:36.550 --> 02:37.930
Rebecca,are you okay?

02:37.930 --> 02:41.490
I'm just really busy trying to help my mom with this party and...

02:41.490 --> 02:43.900
are you sure?Because I feel like ever-- ever since 

02:43.900 --> 02:46.630
I cooked you dinner the other night,you've been acting kinda weird toward me.

02:46.630 --> 02:49.100
Was it the chicken?Was the chicken that bad?

02:49.100 --> 02:51.420
No,it was good.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.630
Well,look,I-I know I said some things that I probably shouldn't have said.

02:55.630 --> 02:59.430
Yeah,like you were gonna vote with my mom to get back at the walkers?

02:59.430 --> 03:01.570
Yeah.I'm sorry.

03:01.570 --> 03:04.570
Taking this job has really hit me a lot harder than I thought it was going to.

03:04.570 --> 03:06.790
I mean,it is william's company,and,I mean,

03:06.790 --> 03:09.980
you know that I've been blaming him for my mom's death,and--god,I gotta--

03:09.980 --> 03:13.300
I gotta quit laying this all on you and get a shrinkor something.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.970
You know what?Maybe we should all get a shrink.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.460
well,anyway,I-I was shooting my mouth off,and,uh,I'm sorry.

03:22.460 --> 03:23.640
It's okay,really.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.010
I mean,I...

03:25.010 --> 03:28.200
I kind of acted t as well when I went through what you're going through,so--

03:28.200 --> 03:29.940
 wait a minute.You acted out?

03:29.940 --> 03:32.150
And what'd you do?

03:32.150 --> 03:34.670
it's a long story.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.690
Hey,so what's this-- what's this thing tomorrow night?

03:37.690 --> 03:39.620
Do we really veto go?

03:39.620 --> 03:43.750
Well,we are the next generation of ojai.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.510
All right.

03:45.510 --> 03:47.850
hey,as long as it's mandatory,do you maybe wanna...

03:47.850 --> 03:49.980
go together,tag team?

03:49.980 --> 03:52.380
Um,yeah,okay.

03:52.860 --> 03:54.620
Justin won't have a problem with that,will he?

03:54.620 --> 03:56.440
No,no.Justin and I are friends.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.930
Okay,great.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.060
I will be there as soon as I can.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.060
No,I will.I will.I promise.

04:05.060 --> 04:08.810
No,he has not left yet.He'S...

04:09.430 --> 04:13.860
okay,yeah.No,that sounds great.I will,um,I will talk to you soon.

04:13.860 --> 04:16.029
All right.Bye.

04:16.029 --> 04:19.959
That's kevin going on and on and on about sarah's event at ojai.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.420
You know,she's really,uh,freakin' out about it.

04:22.420 --> 04:24.410
Kitty,stop.

04:24.410 --> 04:27.440
You already told me you're not seeing him anymore,you never slept with him.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.160
I didn'T.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.370
-Here.
-What's that?

04:33.370 --> 04:37.920
,It's just a little something to make your first day back at work a little easier.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.880
Why would it be hard?

04:39.880 --> 04:45.250
Well,I don't know.Maybe because you had a heart attack the last time you were there.

04:45.250 --> 04:49.480
It's jt a framed picture of evan for your desk.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.890
Thank you.

Can I send him up?

05:24.500 --> 05:26.230
No.Well,yes,yes.

05:26.230 --> 05:29.440
Can you please just--just stall him for about two minutes?

05:29.440 --> 05:30.780
How?

05:30.780 --> 05:32.190
I don't know.I don't know.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.730
Ask him--ask him-- ask him about the--the...

05:34.730 --> 05:37.050
the capital-- capital gains tax.

05:37.050 --> 05:38.880
-What?
-I'm sorry.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.410
I'm sorry,buit's--it's my dad.

05:40.410 --> 05:41.920
Is that my cue to hide in the closet?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.200
No,this would be your cue to leave.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.800
I'm very sorry to do this.I was having a very nice time.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.560
Kitty,dad's tend to be impressed by me.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.310
Yeah,well,but not this dad.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.890
Sorry,I'll call you.I'll call you.

05:53.470 --> 05:55.580
What am I gonna do?

06:00.570 --> 06:04.500
I need a book.Where's my book?

06:04.500 --> 06:07.190
book.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.490
Hey,daddy.

06:13.490 --> 06:14.520
Hi,sweetie.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.050
You weren't supposed to be here until tomorrow.

06:17.050 --> 06:19.340
I couldn't wait to see you,hon.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.500
Am I...interrupting something here?

06:22.500 --> 06:25.070
Oh,no.

06:25.070 --> 06:26.790
no,no,I was,uh...

06:26.790 --> 06:29.790
just,uh...I was reading.This is a very good book.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.350
You know,hanging out?

06:31.350 --> 06:36.170
Well,good.Then can i take you to dinner at that new place you told me about?

06:36.170 --> 06:39.700
I-I so hate to burst your bubble,but...

06:39.700 --> 06:41.760
this isn't pasadena.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.350
You can't-- you can't just get a-- a reservation at boule just--just like that.

06:46.350 --> 06:48.540
Oh,darn.

06:48.540 --> 06:52.680
They're holding a corner booth for us in an hour.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.480
No way.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.040
No,you...

06:56.040 --> 06:58.680
how on earth did you do that?

06:58.680 --> 07:03.570
Oh,I love you,baby,but I'm not gonna tell you all my secrets.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.090
all right.

07:10.090 --> 07:12.850
Alec.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.600
It is alec,isn't it?

07:15.600 --> 07:18.840
Whatever the hell you and my wife have going on is irrelevant to me.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.310
But what is relevant is that you never call my house again.

07:22.310 --> 07:23.470
Look,I understand that you're angry-- 

07:23.470 --> 07:26.200
oh,you can't begin to understand me.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.100
So let me make myself perfectly clear.

07:29.100 --> 07:34.300
I will do absolutely everything in my power to protect my marriage,

07:34.300 --> 07:37.520
and I'm a very powerful man.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.830
Maybe that's your problem.

07:39.830 --> 07:43.860
No,that's your problem.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.680
morning.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.150
Morning.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.830
You all right?

08:09.830 --> 08:12.180
Fine.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.150
It's just that the last time I was down here...

08:17.150 --> 08:19.470
I know.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.090
Come on.Let's go up.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.669
surprise!

08:36.929 --> 08:38.840
are you guys trying to put me back into the hospital?

08:38.840 --> 08:42.419
I told 'em jumping out and shouting "surprise" might not be the best way to welcome you back,

08:42.419 --> 08:46.250
but you can blame kitty for all of this.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.490
Well,thank you,guys.I mean...

08:49.490 --> 08:53.530
this is just...it's great to be back,and...

08:53.530 --> 08:56.480
this place really feels like home.So that's it.

08:56.480 --> 09:00.880
Have some cake,have some coffee,'cause andrew didn't write a speech for any of this.

09:07.220 --> 09:09.270
This is your idea?

09:09.270 --> 09:13.840
I really was on the phone with kevin this morning.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.990
You know,I have about...

09:15.990 --> 09:19.990
three months worth of work to do,so I should probably...

09:26.520 --> 09:27.820
I'm--I'm gonna go.I'll see you later.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.240
What?Come on.That was,like,the shortest surprise party in histor 

09:30.240 --> 09:32.520
you took longer choosing the cake than you did standing here.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.850
Yeah,well,he's got a lot of work to do,and--and I've gotta get back to evan and...

09:38.620 --> 09:40.280
so,uh,thank you for everything,

09:40.280 --> 09:44.070
and--and I'll see you tomorrow night at the--at the ojai party,right?

09:46.660 --> 09:51.350
Yes,joe,I realize you gave up christmas,but I still need to think about it.

09:51.350 --> 09:53.580
Because a month is a very long time,okay?

09:53.580 --> 09:56.600
And I've--I've gotta get my head around it.

09:57.020 --> 09:59.540
For-- listen,I'm at work.I need to call you back,okay?

09:59.540 --> 10:00.410
Thank you.

10:00.410 --> 10:01.860
I can come back.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.890
No,it's fine.

10:03.890 --> 10:04.720
What is it?

10:04.720 --> 10:07.970
Well,you know how this party is all about boosting morale and showing

10:07.970 --> 10:10.300
that you and i are in sync?

10:10.300 --> 10:11.240
Yes.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.160
Well,maybe we should do something memorable.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.740
An open bar,good food-- I think that's pretty memorable.

10:17.740 --> 10:20.790
Sarah,everyone knows our history.

10:20.790 --> 10:26.070
Why don't we shine a spotlight on it and make fun of ourselves?

10:26.070 --> 10:29.810
What I had in mind is doing a little number.

10:29.810 --> 10:31.180
A number?

10:31.180 --> 10:33.000
A song and dance.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.130
Oh,I forgot.You're an actress.

10:35.130 --> 10:39.450
Come on.It would be fun.We can make complete asses out of ourselves.

10:39.450 --> 10:40.980
-No.
-Okay.

10:40.980 --> 10:45.080
I guess you are in a terrible mood.

10:45.080 --> 10:47.440
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.830
Joe is getting remarried.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.360
have you met the other woman?

10:56.360 --> 10:59.490
Oh,yeah,yeah.His first wife.

10:59.490 --> 11:02.120
Apparently,he should never have left her.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.140
Simple girl,simple needs.

11:05.140 --> 11:08.570
Maybe I should learn to take it down a notch if I ever want to meet anybody.

11:08.570 --> 11:11.390
That is a fool's errand.

11:11.390 --> 11:14.560
No,you're right.I couldn't be bothered.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.650
You'll find the right person.

11:16.650 --> 11:18.260
I finally did.

11:18.260 --> 11:22.100
You just gotta go out there and make it happen.

11:22.100 --> 11:24.360
Have you tried online dating?

11:24.360 --> 11:30.400
Oh,come on,holly.You're just trying to thinup another way for me to make a complete ass of myself.

11:30.400 --> 11:35.540
you'll see.The employees would love it.

11:35.540 --> 11:38.070
All right,I'll do the number.

11:38.070 --> 11:41.950
Thattagirl.And I have the perfect song.

11:48.260 --> 11:49.350
Nora?

11:49.350 --> 11:50.760
What?I'm in the pantry.

11:50.760 --> 11:53.040
Would you stop taking your anxiety out on those baked beans

11:53.040 --> 11:56.990
and tell me why you're googling private detectives?

11:56.990 --> 11:59.800
I thought maybe I could find someone who would help me track down tommy.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.060
You know,has he been using his credit cards or his cell phone?

12:02.060 --> 12:04.200
I can't just sit around hoping he'll walk through the door.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.440
The answer isn't to go and get him and drag him through it.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.400
You know that.He needs to come back on his own.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.050
Stop telling me to let go.

12:11.050 --> 12:13.790
I can't let go.I can't do anything but...

12:13.790 --> 12:15.760
but wonder and--and worry-- where is he-- 

12:15.760 --> 12:17.750
okay,I--that's fair enough.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.700
Is that why you're not coming to the party?

12:20.700 --> 12:23.300
Oh,did they send you here to try to make me change my mind?

12:23.300 --> 12:25.810
No one sent me here,nora.

12:25.810 --> 12:29.830
I'm here because I'm worried about you.

12:30.130 --> 12:32.820
I'm so scared for him.I can't eat.I can't sleep.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.930
I have to do something.

12:36.620 --> 12:40.780
Sweetheart,promise me you won't be surfing the web looking for some second-rate detective,okay?

12:40.780 --> 12:42.110
Well,do you know one you trust?

12:42.110 --> 12:45.620
I don't think we need one.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.760
Oh,of course.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.510
I need you to call wade and gordon and get them the revised list of endorsements.

12:54.510 --> 12:57.930
Also,I need to know who my surrogates are gonna be at those san diego fund-raisers.

12:57.930 --> 13:00.340
Sure.

13:00.340 --> 13:02.940
is something going on between you and kitty?

13:02.940 --> 13:04.590
Because this morning,you two seemed kind of-- 

13:04.590 --> 13:08.500
you know what?If you want to know what's going on,you should ask your sister.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.940
I think you and i are way past that,and I'm not gonna get anything else done

13:11.940 --> 13:15.770
until you tell me what's going on.

13:20.150 --> 13:22.830
Kitty and I are...

13:22.830 --> 13:25.270
she's seeing someone.

13:25.270 --> 13:27.660
What do you mean?

13:27.660 --> 13:29.330
well,I'M...

13:29.330 --> 13:30.330
-w-who?
-I don't know.

13:30.330 --> 13:33.020
Some putz from the park with a diaper bag.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.120
W--oh,my god.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.770
How--how-- how far along is this?

13:35.770 --> 13:38.600
If you're asking me what base they're on,I don't know.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.510
She could be screwing him right now,and I wouldn't know.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.500
She's not gonna tell me.

13:42.500 --> 13:48.850
So if you're looking for gory details,like I said,you should...talk to your sister.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.970
I-I don't know what to say.

13:50.970 --> 13:52.720
Either do I.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.090
Do you want me to talk to her?

13:54.090 --> 13:55.450
Not on my acunt.

13:55.450 --> 13:57.380
Well,do you-- do you want to get...

13:57.380 --> 13:59.820
drunk or see strippers?

13:59.820 --> 14:04.790
I dot--i don't-- I don't know what you straight guys need in this situation.

14:04.790 --> 14:09.140
What this straight guy needs right now is for you to call wade and gordon.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.930
Because if my work's all I'm gonna have left,

14:10.930 --> 14:13.450
I'm damn well not letting anything fall by the wayside.

14:13.450 --> 14:16.130
Sure.I'll cl 'em right now.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.710
hey,is everything okay?I came as fast as I could.

14:23.710 --> 14:26.310
Uh,I hope so.

14:26.310 --> 14:29.170
I got a letter from-- from santa barbara-- the admissions office.

14:29.170 --> 14:31.050
Is thiabout med school?

14:31.050 --> 14:34.990
Yeah,it's a-- it's a dual program,so I can get my bachelor's at the same time.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.190
You didn't even tell me that you applied.

14:36.190 --> 14:39.300
No,I know.I told you I wanted to be a doctor,though.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.300
Well,why didn't you open it yet?

14:41.300 --> 14:42.930
Because you were at work.

14:42.930 --> 14:44.930
Becca,you're the first person I talked about this to,all right?

14:44.930 --> 14:47.610
M--I'm not gonna open it without you.

14:47.610 --> 14:50.010
Well,it looks thick.That's good,right?

14:50.010 --> 14:51.920
You think I would've called you if it was skinny?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.370
-No,no,no,no.No,no,come on.
-Justin!Justin,give it to me.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.060
-I can'T.I can't open it.Stop.
-I'm opening it.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.730
No,no,please.Seriously,I can'T...

14:57.730 --> 14:59.470
okay,hold on,hold on.

15:02.480 --> 15:08.230
"Dear mr.Walker,"it is our pleasure to inform you that you have been accepted"...

15:08.230 --> 15:11.660
-oh,my god justin,you got in.
-I got in.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.840
-Justin,you got in!
-I got in!I got in!I got in!I got...

15:14.840 --> 15:17.970
I am so...proud of you.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.280
Do we have to get up?

15:39.280 --> 15:40.990
What,you mean ever?

15:40.990 --> 15:42.530
Yes,ever.

15:42.530 --> 15:46.270
Well,I think I'm pretty much free until the fall semester starts.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.530
-about last night-- 
-oh,let's not.

15:51.530 --> 15:52.510
Not what?

15:52.510 --> 15:57.420
Overanalyze whether it was makeup sex or congratulations sex.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.040
Congratulations sex?

15:59.040 --> 16:02.560
I've never even heard of congratulations sex.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.980
It's still complicated with our families.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.290
Oh,I know.

16:08.290 --> 16:11.240
Speaking of which,please do not say anything about med school tonight,all right?

16:11.240 --> 16:14.170
-Why?
-It's just--I've applied to better schools in other states,

16:14.170 --> 16:18.340
and I just don't need my family weighing in on which ones I should go to,so...

16:18.340 --> 16:21.500
it would be pretty great,though-- up-and-coming med student,

16:21.500 --> 16:24.140
the high-powered ojai board member on his arm.

16:24.140 --> 16:26.500
Yeah,that sounds sexy.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.530
-Oh,god.
-What?

16:28.530 --> 16:31.610
I told ryan that I'd go with him.

16:31.610 --> 16:33.700
-You're kidding.
-No.

16:33.700 --> 16:34.930
As friends.

16:34.930 --> 16:38.400
Well,wait a second,last week,you're all,"I don't trust the kid,"and now you're like,"poor ryan"?

16:38.400 --> 16:42.330
-It's complicated.
-How is it complicated,rebecca?

16:46.280 --> 16:49.690
he thinks that his mom killed herself.

16:49.690 --> 16:51.970
What?

16:51.970 --> 16:55.770
William was with connie the night before it happened,in reno,

16:55.770 --> 16:58.890
and ryan thinks that something happened there that pushed her over the edge.

16:58.890 --> 17:01.830
That's cra-- does he have any proof?

17:01.830 --> 17:04.260
There are expense reports.

17:04.260 --> 17:06.460
Your dad billed the hotel to the company.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.060
Oh,no.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.700
I know.I know,justin.I wanted to tell you.I did.

17:10.700 --> 17:15.270
It's just not my place.And I honestly don't know if it's true.

17:15.599 --> 17:19.770
But if you don't want me to go with him...I understand.

17:20.810 --> 17:25.369
Look,go with him,all right?Just go be his friend.

17:25.369 --> 17:28.550
I mean,how could i say anything after that?Like...

17:28.550 --> 17:30.430
yeah.

17:30.430 --> 17:33.690
I--I'm sorry,but this is my future.This is my baby's future...

17:33.690 --> 17:35.810
-yeah,yes,it is.
-And I don't want to make a mistake.

17:35.810 --> 17:39.080
So what,so what,the whole world's supposed to come to some screeching halt

17:39.080 --> 17:40.680
while we wait for youto make up your mind?

17:40.680 --> 17:45.260
The only thing that is screeching around here is you.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.890
Did you?

17:48.300 --> 17:49.580
did I what,sleep with him?

17:49.580 --> 17:51.270
No.No,but you want to know something?

17:51.270 --> 17:54.960
Anybody else in my position would have.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.260
I mean,come on,kevin,you know better than anybody that--that--

17:57.260 --> 18:01.630
that robert has never completely let me in.

18:01.630 --> 18:03.950
I mean,claiming that evan and i are his first priority

18:03.950 --> 18:06.500
and then secretly going behind my back and running for governor?

18:06.500 --> 18:08.750
I know,I know.

18:08.750 --> 18:13.320
L-- you know what?This whole thing,it's confusing for me.

18:14.710 --> 18:18.260
It's interesting.You know,he reminds me a little bit of dad.

18:18.260 --> 18:20.800
And I refuse to forgive everything.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.220
I refuse to just let everything go.

18:24.220 --> 18:27.460
I don't want to be like mom.

18:27.460 --> 18:30.950
Doesn't having an affair make you more like dad?

18:31.260 --> 18:33.710
I told you,kevin...

18:33.710 --> 18:37.790
I am not having an affair.

18:37.790 --> 18:42.860
Look,I'm sorry that you feel like you're stuck in the middle,but I...

18:44.720 --> 18:47.240
I don't feel like I'm stuck in the middle.

18:47.240 --> 18:53.800
I think you are.You're surrounded by extremely imperfect men who love you.

18:57.640 --> 19:00.250
but I'm the lucky one.

19:00.250 --> 19:03.540
'Cause you can't get rid of me.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.650
robert.

19:07.650 --> 19:08.730
Nora.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.140
You didn't tell kevin I was here,did you?

19:11.140 --> 19:13.020
I didn't even know you were here.

19:13.020 --> 19:14.860
oh,right.C-could I...

19:14.860 --> 19:16.700
please.

19:21.830 --> 19:23.520
Look,if--if this is about kitty...

19:23.520 --> 19:25.540
what about kitty?Is something wrong with kitty?

19:25.540 --> 19:27.590
-What?
-Did you two have a fight?

19:27.590 --> 19:30.740
No.No.I'm--I'm so sorry.

19:30.740 --> 19:33.600
Please,tell me what brings you here.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.010
Robert,I-I know how you feel about using your office for personal favors,

19:37.010 --> 19:39.280
and I don't want to put you in an awkward situation.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.270
When justin was injured in iraq,and no one could tell me anything,

19:42.270 --> 19:43.700
you were the only person I could turn to.

19:43.700 --> 19:46.780
It's--it's fine.Just-- just tell me what you need.

19:46.780 --> 19:49.960
I need to find tommy.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.870
Right.

19:50.870 --> 19:54.820
Robert,you have access to people who can get information,and I'm going crazy.

19:54.820 --> 19:58.350
I--I'm going crazy.I'm trying not to imagine the worst.

19:58.350 --> 20:01.160
No,no,no.I'll make the calls.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.750
Really?

20:02.750 --> 20:09.740
But,nora,if I find him,you know,there's no guarantee that he's gonna want to see you.

20:09.740 --> 20:12.380
I know he doesn't want to see me.That'S...

20:12.380 --> 20:16.570
that's okay.I just need to know he's all right.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.550
I'll call you when I hear something.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.700
Thank you.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.370
Oh,robert,thank you.

20:38.930 --> 20:43.960
we are talking about a whack-job dictator who is stockpiling weapons of mass destruction,

20:43.960 --> 20:46.900
which,when he feels like it,he is using against his own people.

20:46.900 --> 20:50.080
America is trying to put this lunatic out of business.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.530
Could somebody please tell me why that is so wrong?

20:52.530 --> 20:55.490
We have time for one more caller.

20:55.490 --> 21:01.470
Oh,great.We have a call on line 1 from pasadena,california.Nora walker.

21:01.470 --> 21:02.330
Hi,mom.

21:02.330 --> 21:04.630
Well,I will give you thousands of reasons why that's wrong,

21:04.630 --> 21:09.140
because that's how many innocent civilians have been killed so far in this liberation scam.

21:09.140 --> 21:12.050
I mean,honestly,kitty,how can you defend this?

21:12.050 --> 21:15.710
I don't know.It's called democracy,liberty,patriotism--

21:15.710 --> 21:17.950
oh,blah,blah,blah,kitty.

21:17.950 --> 21:21.450
-Okay,we are out of time...But thank you for calling.
-kitty,are you well?

21:21.450 --> 21:26.110
And,uh,just for the record,I take after my father.

21:26.110 --> 21:29.600
So we will be back right after the news.

21:32.170 --> 21:34.800
do you see?Do you see?You
know,she never calls me.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.300
She never calls unlessshe
wants to rant on my show.

21:39.350 --> 21:41.430
honestly...

21:41.630 --> 21:44.730
don't you ever want to
tell her to put sock in it?

21:45.080 --> 21:48.260
You don't really want
me to answer at,do you?

21:49.830 --> 21:51.870
besides,I'm lucky to have her.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.100
Yeah,well,you're a saint,daddy.

21:54.220 --> 21:56.280
Sorry.This is business.

21:56.630 --> 21:58.170
hello.

21:59.020 --> 22:02.350
No,I can'T.I'm in new
york.I'll have to call back.

22:02.970 --> 22:04.390
oh,you didn't have to do that.

22:04.470 --> 22:05.760
I don't mind.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.570
I do.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.330
unbelievable.

22:11.410 --> 22:13.490
Is that the same person?

22:14.030 --> 22:16.170
yeah.Pain in the ass.

22:33.300 --> 22:34.930
I--I'm
sorry.You just...

22:34.970 --> 22:36.350
you look spectacular.

22:36.460 --> 22:38.040
Oh,thanks.

22:38.110 --> 22:39.370
You don't look so bad yourself.

22:39.450 --> 22:44.250
Oh,thanks.I,uh,threw on my
wedding/ funeral/unity party jacket.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.600
Well,I think the board
will be very impressed.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.310
Yeah,that's kinda what I was going for.

22:49.430 --> 22:51.190
You must have been at work at
the crack of dawn this morning.

22:51.270 --> 22:55.480
Oh,yeah.I had a lot of work to
do,so I stayed over at my mom'S.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.520
All right.Well,I'm ready.

22:57.600 --> 23:02.550
Hey,I-I just want to say,uh,you
know,thank you for being my date.

23:02.650 --> 23:04.690
Yeah.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.530
So let's go.

23:15.950 --> 23:19.000
There's mom.Mom.Mom.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.090
You said you weren't gonna come.

23:21.140 --> 23:22.120
Yeah,I know.

23:25.890 --> 23:28.050
I was taking out all
this tommy stuff on you.

23:28.090 --> 23:30.560
I'm here,and I want to be
totally supportive of you.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.030
Well,thank god for that,because
at some point this evening,

23:33.060 --> 23:37.180
I have to get up in front of all these
people and sing a duet with holly.

23:37.300 --> 23:38.320
What?Are you kidding me?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.180
Why?You're gonna sing a duet with holly?

23:39.250 --> 23:41.810
She's not joking.Come on.I
need to put a mike on you.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.200
- Okay,don't laugh.
- Let's go.Sorry.

23:44.240 --> 23:47.070
- Don't laugh.
- Oh,no,no.We won't laugh.No.

23:47.180 --> 23:48.210
Oh,yes,we will.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.390
- Sing a duet?
- She shouldn't do that to herself,mom.

23:51.450 --> 23:53.100
Kitty,I...

23:53.180 --> 23:55.260
I talked to robert today.

23:55.610 --> 23:56.630
Okay.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.400
- O-o--it's-- just
listen to me-- no,shh,shh.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.170
Look,please don't tell anyone.

24:00.240 --> 24:03.070
He's gonna help me try to find tommy.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.140
Oh,really?

24:06.890 --> 24:08.420
What did--what did you do?Did
you browbeat him into it?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.180
No,he...

24:10.230 --> 24:16.040
he was so supportive and just there for
me,and I've always been so hard on him.

24:16.390 --> 24:18.630
He's a really good man.

24:19.530 --> 24:20.750
Well,yeah.

24:20.810 --> 24:22.580
No,yeah,he is.

24:26.970 --> 24:29.320
Hey,iigured you'd be at the party.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.990
Yeah,I figured you wouldn't be.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.000
You talked to kitty.

24:34.590 --> 24:36.890
- Yeah.
- Yeah,how'd that go?

24:38.220 --> 24:40.180
Well,there was a lot of weeping.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.070
Then kitty told me to buck up.

24:42.150 --> 24:44.050
- Great.
- We've got you...

24:44.130 --> 24:47.660
exactly where you want
to be,in the middle.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.620
Look,robert...

24:51.900 --> 24:53.900
I love this job.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.880
But more importantly,I
love you both very much.

24:56.960 --> 25:03.120
So I have to assume that you'll find a way
to figure this out,because if you don'T...

25:04.660 --> 25:07.650
- I'm gonna ve
to-- take sides.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.240
Sure.I understand how that
works.I'm a politician.

25:11.630 --> 25:14.060
Does it help to be that cynical?

25:14.160 --> 25:17.260
No,not really.

25:17.810 --> 25:19.120
Come on.You're a senator.

25:19.160 --> 25:22.060
Can't you get this guy
drafted or something?

25:22.650 --> 25:24.970
he'd probably be 4-F.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.440
I love her,kevin.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.130
I want my marriage to work.

25:37.990 --> 25:40.300
So do I.

25:40.580 --> 25:44.090
You know what the real
tragedy is?I'd miss those...

25:44.250 --> 25:46.670
walker family meltdowns.

25:48.990 --> 25:51.660
what time do they get started tonight?

25:52.160 --> 25:54.000
Two hours ago.

25:57.960 --> 25:58.980
he kissed you?

25:59.060 --> 26:00.060
I said don't overreact.

26:00.180 --> 26:01.770
- How did this happen?
- I don't know.It was weird.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.290
- I-I didn't know what to do.- Did
you tell him we're back together?

26:04.360 --> 26:05.780
No,justin.We said we
weren't gonna tell anyone.

26:05.860 --> 26:06.900
You know what?This is
crazy.I'm gonna talk to him

26:06.980 --> 26:08.670
-- justin-- it's
fine,all right?

26:08.710 --> 26:10.830
Just--just
trust me.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.670
Can I talk to you for a second?

26:15.260 --> 26:16.130
Yeah.

26:16.210 --> 26:17.820
So,uh...

26:17.930 --> 26:20.030
you and rebecca?It's not gonna happen.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.030
That's funny,because we're on a date.

26:25.610 --> 26:27.490
N-no,you're not.

26:27.530 --> 26:31.220
All right,and I know you didn't know this when you tried
to kiss her,but we're actually getting back together.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.880
- Really?
- Then why did she kiss me back?

26:34.670 --> 26:38.350
You're a real piece of work,aren't you?

26:38.480 --> 26:42.330
Is this thing that you have for rebecca even real,or
is this just another way to screw with me and my family?

26:42.370 --> 26:43.430
What's that supposed to mean?

26:43.480 --> 26:46.200
I know,okay?I know.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.240
I know about your bad
feelings towards my dad.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.700
I know that's why you work at ojai.

26:49.740 --> 26:53.420
I know that's why you made a pact with holly
to vote with her at all the board meetings.

26:53.500 --> 26:56.920
- You must have kissed up to
holly-- I didn't kiss up to anybody.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.790
She came to me.

27:07.130 --> 27:08.930
There you e!

27:09.170 --> 27:10.390
We're on.

27:10.460 --> 27:11.970
I could kill you right now.

27:12.050 --> 27:14.150
Oh,no,no,no.You're just
nervous.Breathe,breathe.

27:14.230 --> 27:15.920
Start the music.

27:23.690 --> 27:26.430
i say either,and you say...

27:26.560 --> 27:27.620
either.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.450
You say neither,and I say...

27:30.530 --> 27:31.530
neither.

27:31.570 --> 27:33.340
Either either.

27:33.500 --> 27:34.780
Neither neither.

27:35.640 --> 27:40.110
Let's call the whole thing off
let's call the whole thing off.

27:40.230 --> 27:42.700
Ojai potato and ojai...

27:42.850 --> 27:43.930
potato.

27:44.010 --> 27:47.300
OjaI tomato and ojai tomato.

27:47.380 --> 27:49.270
Potato potato.

27:49.380 --> 27:51.460
To-mato
to-mato.

27:51.580 --> 27:54.930
let's call the whole thing off

27:55.780 --> 27:58.610
you deliberately sabotaged the act.

27:58.650 --> 28:01.430
You're lucky I didn't pull your
sash off and choke you with it.

28:01.510 --> 28:02.320
What did I do?

28:02.440 --> 28:04.130
You played me,holly.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.800
You manipulated me into
letting ryan on the board.

28:06.870 --> 28:08.200
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.

28:08.260 --> 28:10.140
You made some kind of deal with him.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.870
What,did he promise you his vote?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.180
I don't have any control over his vote.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.660
Why don't you give me some credit
for how hard I work around here?

28:17.740 --> 28:21.070
The only hard work you've ever done
is getting my father into the sack.

28:21.150 --> 28:22.570
So what did you say to ryan?

28:22.680 --> 28:25.210
I welcomed him to this company.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.540
You made an alliance.

28:26.620 --> 28:27.840
Please.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.590
You think I'm in bed with ryan lafferty?

28:30.670 --> 28:34.900
Not even I would go there,holly,but now that
you mention it,I wouldn't put it past you.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.830
You are upset.I understand.

28:36.910 --> 28:39.150
Your husband is remarrying.

28:39.220 --> 28:40.560
I would be upset,too.

28:40.600 --> 28:44.700
Really?Because I've begun to think that
you're incapable of having genuine emotions.

28:44.780 --> 28:48.700
The only way you know how to deal with
people is to make a deal with them.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.420
Espera.Espera.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.990
You're right.

28:54.070 --> 28:59.700
I was just trying to get some security in ojai
because I was never gonna get it from you,right?

28:59.860 --> 29:05.480
You have never given me one reason to believe
that I could ever be anything but your enemy.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.330
You can drop the sensitive act.

29:07.370 --> 29:08.860
The show's over,holly.

29:08.940 --> 29:12.660
So bottom line--you think
that I am a sociopath?

29:12.740 --> 29:13.960
Borderline.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.170
Well,you know what I think you are?

29:15.220 --> 29:17.340
No.I can't wait to hear,though.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.070
Unhappy.

29:20.950 --> 29:23.030
- Ryan.
- Hey,you guys still fighting over me?

29:23.700 --> 29:27.190
Ryan,I had no idea it was
a competition until tonight.

29:27.230 --> 29:30.190
Yeah?Well,don't worry,'cause after this
evening,there will be no competition.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.030
I'm gonna take care of myself,and
you guys can go to hell.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.520
Would you guys please stop it in
here?Everyone can hear what you're saying.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.300
Excuse me.I think you may
want to go back to the party,

29:36.340 --> 29:38.930
because your guests are
slightly freaked out.

29:38.970 --> 29:40.110
Uh,ryan,are you okay?

29:40.190 --> 29:43.340
Could you just leave us alone so
that I can talk with ryan and sarah?

29:43.450 --> 29:45.210
I don't want to talk to you.

29:45.290 --> 29:47.300
I don't trust you.I
don't trust any of you.

29:47.340 --> 29:48.570
- Ryan-- I don't want
to talk to you,either.

29:48.650 --> 29:50.300
You got me into this mess.

29:50.420 --> 29:53.240
I'm gonna go to your house,I'm gonna pack
my things,and I'll be gone in an hour.

29:53.280 --> 29:57.010
Would you people just
please leave me alone?

30:04.540 --> 30:06.500
I don't understand.I mean,what happened?

30:06.580 --> 30:08.530
What would make him lose it like that?

30:08.560 --> 30:09.820
Clearly,he's in trouble.

30:09.860 --> 30:11.570
Guys,I'm--I'm
sorry.This is my fault.

30:11.650 --> 30:12.830
Justin,no,it's not.

30:12.910 --> 30:13.890
It is.

30:13.970 --> 30:17.150
You told me not to talk to him,and I
talked to him,and I'm--I'm sorry,rebecca.

30:17.230 --> 30:19.390
Well,talk to him about what?

30:19.500 --> 30:21.910
Nothing,mom.This is
between me and rebecca.

30:21.990 --> 30:25.280
Justin,under the circumstances,if you
have any information about ryan,come on.

30:25.360 --> 30:27.250
He's right.You should say sometng.

30:27.310 --> 30:29.080
What do you know,justin?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.770
All right.We just need
to give this kid space.

30:31.810 --> 30:34.710
I mean,he's-- he's
really messed up.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.340
He thinks his mom committed suicide.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.830
Well,she died in a car accident.

30:38.940 --> 30:40.860
Well,he doesn't think
it was an accident.

30:40.940 --> 30:43.370
- Oh,my god.- And here's the kicker--
he thinks dad was responsible.

30:43.450 --> 30:44.870
But dad wasn't in the car.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.710
Yeah,how is dad responsible for that?

30:46.790 --> 30:50.010
He found receipts showing
that--that dad and...

30:52.180 --> 30:55.550
connie were in a hotel room the
night before she crashed her car.

30:55.590 --> 30:59.830
And he thinks that something happened
that night that drove her to do it.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.000
Well...

31:03.080 --> 31:04.290
where were they?

31:04.360 --> 31:05.660
Uh,reno.

31:05.740 --> 31:07.510
okay,okay.

31:07.580 --> 31:09.980
I will go to reno.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.470
Yes.

31:11.550 --> 31:13.040
Connie,listen to me.

31:13.120 --> 31:17.090
We'll talk about this when
I get there.I have to go.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.290
I'm sorry.I didn't,uh,didn't
mean to interrupt.

31:22.370 --> 31:24.530
No,I'm sorry.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.210
Well,it seems like you're-- you're
dealing with a-a crazy person.

31:28.290 --> 31:34.740
Well,this is what happens when you get into business with someone
who,uh,wants to change the terms of the contract midway through.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.460
So what are you gonna do?

31:37.540 --> 31:40.910
Right now I'm just trying to
terminate the relationship.

31:40.950 --> 31:43.550
So why go to reno?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.210
Damage control.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.750
Rebecca's not here.She's
probably at justin'S.

32:04.650 --> 32:06.850
Well,actually,I came to talk to you.

32:07.670 --> 32:11.110
Look,I-I know that-- that we haven't
spent a lot of time together,but--

32:11.190 --> 32:12.680
what do you want?

32:13.800 --> 32:15.370
I know what you think
happened to your mother.

32:15.410 --> 32:18.520
If you came here to tell me that I'm crazy or
I was out of line,then you can just go ahead--

32:18.560 --> 32:20.490
no,no,I came to tell you
that I think you're right.

32:20.650 --> 32:23.600
I think my father hurt
your mother very deeply.

32:25.880 --> 32:29.900
I,uh,I-I heard him on the phone once.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.120
He was talking to a woman named connie.

32:33.200 --> 32:36.910
And at the time,I thought it was
a-a business deal gone south,...

32:37.030 --> 32:43.300
but he was planning on meeting her in reno,and
I think he was planning on breaking it off

32:43.660 --> 32:45.590
for good.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.340
I mean,look,I...

32:48.380 --> 32:51.320
I loved my father.I-I loved him...

32:52.260 --> 32:54.080
more than anything.But...

32:55.530 --> 32:59.110
when he wanted to,he could be
a real tough son of a bitch.

32:59.200 --> 33:03.850
I mean,he had these terms he judged
relationships by,and if you tried to change them

33:03.970 --> 33:07.940
or you tried to change him,he just
would simply cut you out of his life.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.060
And so my mom must have
been a real problem for him.

33:13.810 --> 33:17.060
Yeah,I think she became
one eventually,yes.

33:20.320 --> 33:22.750
Well,thank you for telling me.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.340
I really needed to know.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.320
Yeah.

33:28.400 --> 33:31.380
Yeah,so did i.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.300
A hot tomato walks into a bar...

33:38.860 --> 33:41.050
very funny.

33:41.560 --> 33:43.330
Oh,it was the dessert,wasn't it?

33:43.410 --> 33:44.740
I knew the candied
ginger was pushing it.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.670
No,I loved the candied ginger.

33:46.710 --> 33:48.680
Everything was perfect.Thanks,scotty.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.060
I'm glad.

33:50.140 --> 33:55.900
Although we did go a little over on the champagne,so
your bill may unfortunately reflect that.

33:57.510 --> 33:59.970
Oh,I'm sorry.We should've alerted you
when we opened up the additional case--

34:00.050 --> 34:01.930
scotty,I don't care about the bill.

34:01.970 --> 34:04.050
Okay,well,I wouldn't worry about what
people heard between you and holly.

34:04.090 --> 34:05.110
I really don't think
they heard that much.

34:05.150 --> 34:07.280
It's not that,either.

34:09.550 --> 34:12.020
And it's not that joe
is getting remarried.

34:12.409 --> 34:14.060
And the kids,they'll love europe.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.340
Who wouldn't?

34:16.389 --> 34:17.719
Joe's getting remarried?

34:17.850 --> 34:19.380
Yeah...

34:19.590 --> 34:21.460
to his first wife.

34:22.659 --> 34:24.780
Apparently they're soul mates.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.739
Sarah,you--you don't still want
to be married to joe,do you?

34:26.780 --> 34:29.610
Oh,god,no.

34:30.510 --> 34:32.670
But I'm lonely.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.580
that's what she sees.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.750
- who is she?
- Holly.

34:39.239 --> 34:42.760

You just have to find a way,no
matter what else is going on.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.350
There's an amazing guy who has been
waiting his whole life to meet you.

35:03.390 --> 35:05.470
You just have to go
out there and find him.

35:05.550 --> 35:07.400

35:07.480 --> 35:11.060

brother and i finally got together.

might come down to that.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.520

37:18.800 --> 37:20.670
He got here early.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.200
I better start checking our options.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.530
Good idea.

37:24.590 --> 37:26.130
What about you?

37:26.240 --> 37:27.840
Oh,I've got some things
I've got to process.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.810

38:05.020 --> 38:07.780

38:07.850 --> 38:09.410
Oh,good.I'll-- I'll
go peek in on him.

38:09.500 --> 38:14.280
W-wait,wait,wait.Robert,I,um,I
spoke with alec.

38:15.150 --> 38:16.800

38:16.870 --> 38:19.020
- Good.-
It--it is.

38:20.040 --> 38:22.570

38:22.740 --> 38:25.350
But,um,that--
that doesn'T...

38:25.430 --> 38:28.030
make our problems go away.

38:29.160 --> 38:33.770
I-I-I-I don't recognize
myself anymore.

38:33.830 --> 38:35.800
I-I...

38:35.870 --> 38:40.210
do not want to be unfaithful,and
I certainly don't want to lie.

38:40.250 --> 38:45.340
We have a son,and--and at the end of the road,it's
not just gonna be us who's gonna get hurt.

38:45.380 --> 38:48.590
It's gonna be him,and I don't want to do
that.I don't want to be my father,robert.

38:48.650 --> 38:50.750
I don't want to do that.

38:50.780 --> 38:52.540
Just...

38:52.820 --> 38:56.820
just tell me what you
think we should do.

38:57.010 --> 38:59.590
I want to take a step back...

38:59.650 --> 39:02.290
spend some time apart.

39:02.390 --> 39:07.770
I think that we both need some
space so we can find our way back.

39:10.690 --> 39:13.410
you're asking me for a separation?

39:19.060 --> 39:20.600
I...I guess so.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.820
- I had a weird dream last night.
- You did?

39:27.930 --> 39:34.380
Yeah,that your mother and my sister were
singing show tunes in tomato-red dresses.

39:34.940 --> 39:40.530
that's so bizarre,'cause I actually had the exact
same one,only in my dream,we found out we were orphans.

39:41.260 --> 39:43.070
that's a good dream.

39:43.150 --> 39:45.110
all right.Tell me more.

39:45.210 --> 39:50.130
Well,then we decided to
sail off to thailand...

39:50.490 --> 39:51.960
and there were pirates.

39:52.040 --> 39:55.100
- I like pirates.
- I knoW.Tell me yours.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.590
Okay,mine.I,uh...

39:57.850 --> 40:00.280

40:02.270 --> 40:05.250

40:05.600 --> 40:12.220
And on sundays,we go for walks on the
beach,or we can go hiking with our dog buster.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.810
Does it have to be "buster"?

40:18.460 --> 40:20.680

40:22.860 --> 40:25.380

want to be a father,and it's all because of you,rebecca.
