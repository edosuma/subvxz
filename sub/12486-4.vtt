WEBVTT

00:04.016 --> 00:05.149
(Gasps)

00:05.150 --> 00:08.620
That is the cutest
thing I have ever seen!

00:08.621 --> 00:11.449
Why am I talking like this?

00:11.450 --> 00:14.759
Thank you. I know I normally
wear floral cardigans,

00:14.760 --> 00:17.995
but I thought I'd live on the
wild side and try unicorns.

00:17.996 --> 00:20.728
Not your sweater. That!

00:20.729 --> 00:22.407
Seth, what is that?

00:22.408 --> 00:26.938
It's a new species of animal I discovered
on my zoology expedition to Australia.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.663
It's a "puppenoala".

00:28.664 --> 00:31.776
A cross between a puppy,
a kitten, and a koala.

00:31.777 --> 00:36.517
Yeah, sure, it's cute,
but can it do this?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.084
Anyway, it's pregnant
with a litter and I...

00:40.085 --> 00:42.435
(Excitedly) I want one! I want one!

00:42.436 --> 00:45.022
Chyna, I can't give the
babies to just anyone.

00:45.023 --> 00:48.025
I need to make sure they'll
be properly cared for.

00:48.026 --> 00:50.539
Please give me one! I'll
take great care of it.

00:50.540 --> 00:52.153
Uh... I'm not so sure about that.

00:52.154 --> 00:55.800
One time, Chyna ran into the market and
left me tied to a parking meter out front.

00:55.801 --> 00:58.363
Quiet! Bad Olive!

00:58.364 --> 01:00.138
(Phone buzzes)

01:00.139 --> 01:03.007
Oh man. They've discovered
a bald eagle in crisis.

01:03.008 --> 01:06.702
They want me to lead the rescue team,
but... I need someone to feed my animals.

01:06.703 --> 01:09.881
(Excitedly) I'll do it! I'll do
it! Because I'm a good friend.

01:09.882 --> 01:11.750
And I'm super responsible!

01:11.751 --> 01:14.363
Responsible enough to have a puppenoala!

01:14.364 --> 01:17.922
Maybe two so they can snuggle!

01:17.923 --> 01:19.991
You sure it's not too much trouble?

01:19.992 --> 01:21.760
No way!

01:21.761 --> 01:24.641
(Animals screeching)

01:28.583 --> 01:30.683
No way!

01:30.852 --> 01:34.094

02:23.895 --> 02:26.511
Guys! Have you guys seen the chameleon?

02:26.512 --> 02:29.137
It looks like, well...

02:29.138 --> 02:31.418
Everything.

02:31.894 --> 02:36.682
You may not know this, but as a possum,
you are one of a variety of didelphimorphs

02:36.683 --> 02:40.556
that plays dead in order to
avoid pests and other nuisances.

02:40.557 --> 02:41.571
Interesting factoid...

02:41.572 --> 02:43.612
(Thuds)

02:44.006 --> 02:46.358
Fletcher, did you see that?
I was just talking about the

02:46.359 --> 02:48.731
defense mechanisms of
didelphimorphs, when suddenly...

02:48.732 --> 02:50.701
(Thuds)

02:50.702 --> 02:52.847
(Phone ringing)

02:52.848 --> 02:54.749
(Gasps) Oh no! It's Seth.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.774
- I don't want to talk to him.
- Okay, I'll do it.

02:56.775 --> 02:58.659
Hi, Seth.

02:58.660 --> 03:00.820
Horrible!

03:00.856 --> 03:01.884
(Chuckles)

03:01.885 --> 03:03.991
Um... what she meant was...

03:03.992 --> 03:06.563
We miss you horribly...

03:06.564 --> 03:11.333
Because we wish you were here
to see how well things are going.

03:11.334 --> 03:14.869
That's great! Mind if I have
a word with Daphne, my duck?

03:14.870 --> 03:16.003
A word?

03:16.004 --> 03:19.013
Yeah. Daphne is
exceptionally intelligent

03:19.014 --> 03:20.841
and I've taught her
to communicate with me.

03:20.842 --> 03:22.301
Oh, really?

03:22.302 --> 03:23.800
I can't let him talk to the duck!

03:23.801 --> 03:26.263
The duck will tell him
how bad a job we're doing!

03:26.264 --> 03:30.395
Um, now is not really
a good time because...

03:30.396 --> 03:33.369
The duck went for a walk.

03:33.370 --> 03:35.545
Well, a waddle.

03:35.546 --> 03:37.395
She went for a walk?

03:37.396 --> 03:42.036
Yes. I know duck is naturally fatty,
but that's no excuse to not exercise.

03:42.037 --> 03:45.066
But I'll tell you called. Bye!

03:45.067 --> 03:47.036
(Sighs) Chyna, how could you do that?

03:47.037 --> 03:49.762
Look, I'm sorry I lied, but
I didn't want Seth to worry.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.758
I meant calling the duck
fat! She's right there!

03:52.759 --> 03:54.979
(Quacking)

04:02.741 --> 04:05.580
Paisley, you're finally here!

04:05.581 --> 04:07.224
Sorry it took me so long.

04:07.225 --> 04:13.125
These rolling suitcases are not
as convenient as you would think.

04:15.757 --> 04:18.327
I have so many things
planned for your visit!

04:18.327 --> 04:21.029
This morning you can compliment my hair.

04:21.031 --> 04:23.132
At lunch, you can compliment my outfit.

04:23.133 --> 04:28.404
And after lunch you can compliment
me on how well I take compliments!

04:28.405 --> 04:32.141
Wow! Your new school looks amazing.

04:32.142 --> 04:38.016
Ha! It's supposed to be so fancy,
but they expect me to make my own bed.

04:38.017 --> 04:39.658
I'll make your bed.

04:39.659 --> 04:43.619
I just need a saw and some wood.

04:44.288 --> 04:49.292
Mr. Grundy, Sir, given that I
have an MBA degree from Harvard,

04:49.293 --> 04:52.548
I was hoping I could have some
responsibilities that didn't involve...

04:52.549 --> 04:53.746
(Shivers)

04:53.747 --> 04:55.907
Children!

04:56.066 --> 04:59.135
Look around. They're everywhere!

04:59.136 --> 05:03.005
You have plenty on your
plate as Den Mother.

05:03.006 --> 05:05.074
It doesn't take up that much time.

05:05.075 --> 05:07.276
When a kid gets hurt, I just
tell them to walk it off.

05:07.277 --> 05:09.212
If they have emotional
problems, "walk it off".

05:09.213 --> 05:11.080
If they're homesick, "walk it off".

05:11.081 --> 05:16.052
Sometimes, if I'm lucky, they walk
all the way home and never come back.

05:16.053 --> 05:19.121
Well, I do need someone
to test the new Z-Phone.

05:19.122 --> 05:21.290
Oh! I'm your man!

05:21.291 --> 05:22.750
I mean, I'm your woman.

05:22.751 --> 05:27.196
I mean, not your woman. Obviously
I'm way out of your league.

05:27.197 --> 05:30.333
But thank you for the opportunity!

05:30.334 --> 05:34.070
I need the new Z-Phone to be
so simple, anyone can use it.

05:34.071 --> 05:38.975
So I need you to test it out on the
least intelligent person on the planet.

05:38.976 --> 05:43.896
Where am I supposed to
find someone that dumb?

05:44.314 --> 05:48.184
Paisley, if you want to cut
that, you have to use the teeth.

05:48.185 --> 05:52.085
Well, that makes much more sense.

05:55.058 --> 05:57.393
That girl is the ideal test subject!

05:57.394 --> 06:00.096
I want to know what kind
of phone she would use.

06:00.097 --> 06:03.032
I want you to pick her...

06:03.033 --> 06:05.853
Let's say, brain.

06:09.239 --> 06:13.019
Let me introduce myself. I'm...

06:14.559 --> 06:18.279
I'm Winter. And your name is?

06:19.149 --> 06:23.289
Come on. Don't keep me in suspense.

06:27.090 --> 06:28.257
(Sighs)

06:28.258 --> 06:29.784
What a day.

06:29.785 --> 06:31.443
So far I've been roared at,

06:31.444 --> 06:34.263
pooped on, and almost lost a
finger trying to serve food.

06:34.264 --> 06:37.967
It's like Thanksgiving with my cousins.

06:37.968 --> 06:41.003
The only good part is I got to
spend the day with my best friend.

06:41.004 --> 06:43.704
Both: Thank you.

06:44.074 --> 06:46.714
I mean Eleanor.

06:47.344 --> 06:50.079
This chicken and I
have so much in common.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.960
We both love hugs.

06:53.050 --> 06:55.384
We both hate eating chicken.

06:55.385 --> 06:58.354
And we both cross the
road for the same reason.

06:58.355 --> 07:00.056
To get to the nail salon.

07:00.057 --> 07:04.857
See, we got matching
manicures. Look at that.

07:06.481 --> 07:08.570
(Device beeps)

07:08.571 --> 07:11.486
Ah, it's time to feed the...

07:11.487 --> 07:13.707
Alligator!

07:16.173 --> 07:18.074
(Growling)

07:18.075 --> 07:19.942
(All screaming)

07:19.943 --> 07:22.144
- Later gator!
- No.

07:22.145 --> 07:25.114
It's our responsibility to
take care of these animals.

07:25.115 --> 07:27.116
We have to do this.

07:27.117 --> 07:31.120
Now, where's the alligator's food?

07:31.121 --> 07:33.858
You're holding it.

07:33.859 --> 07:35.075
What?

07:35.076 --> 07:38.094
It says to feed the
chicken to the alligator.

07:38.095 --> 07:39.962
But I can't!

07:39.963 --> 07:43.132
She's a living creature, and my friend!

07:43.133 --> 07:46.002
Besides, we have a salon
appointment at three o'clock!

07:46.003 --> 07:50.263
We're both getting our hair feathered!

07:56.647 --> 08:01.639
Okay, Paisley. Your job is very simple.
I just need you to test the phone.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.461
You mean like a history test?

08:04.462 --> 08:07.562
Who was the twelveteenth President...

08:07.563 --> 08:11.523
Of the Un-tied Skates of America?

08:12.404 --> 08:14.538
Why did I bother getting an MBA?

08:14.539 --> 08:16.838
Mmm. You got us a sandwich?

08:16.839 --> 08:19.950
By the way, I think it's pronounced BLT.

08:19.951 --> 08:24.091
But don't ask me how it's spelled.

08:24.449 --> 08:27.922
Mr. Grundy, you're ruining
my weekend with Paisley!

08:27.923 --> 08:30.174
She's supposed to be
helping me arrange my clothes

08:30.175 --> 08:33.557
according to how inferior
they make people feel.

08:33.558 --> 08:37.000
Sorry, she's an employee of Z-Tech now.

08:37.001 --> 08:40.096
Although, after seeing her
try to eat a piece of wood,

08:40.097 --> 08:43.166
I regret giving her dental coverage.

08:43.167 --> 08:44.967
You hired Paisley?

08:44.968 --> 08:48.138
She's a total airhead. She
couldn't even get into this school.

08:48.139 --> 08:50.798
Well, our standards are very high.

08:50.799 --> 08:53.512
No. I mean she couldn't
even get into the building.

08:53.513 --> 08:56.822
She doesn't know how to work a door!

08:56.823 --> 08:59.115
Let's try something very simple.

08:59.116 --> 09:00.609
Try calling me.

09:00.610 --> 09:02.305
Okay.

09:02.306 --> 09:05.006
(Yelling) Winter!

09:08.392 --> 09:11.927
I can't feed Eleanor to an alligator.

09:11.928 --> 09:14.030
We don't have to feed the
alligator this chicken.

09:14.031 --> 09:17.167
Why don't we just get a rotisserie
chicken from the cafeteria?

09:17.168 --> 09:20.102
Obvious factoid, alligators are hunters.

09:20.103 --> 09:24.719
It's not going to eat a
chicken that's not moving.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.445
Fletcher: (High-pitched-voice)
La, la, la, la, la.

09:28.446 --> 09:30.079
I feel so...

09:30.080 --> 09:32.060
Alive!

09:32.528 --> 09:36.308
Get it closer to the alligator.

09:39.290 --> 09:42.158
I'm just going to go
for a little stroll!

09:42.159 --> 09:47.095
(Growling) Looking tasty
and showing a little skin.

09:47.096 --> 09:51.111
I hope I don't run into
a big, nasty alligator.

09:51.112 --> 09:52.850
Ooh.

09:52.851 --> 09:55.071
- This is a disaster.
- I know.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.832
Fletcher, your string
work is shoddy and the

09:56.833 --> 10:01.813
chicken's narrative is
hackneyed and predictable.

10:03.180 --> 10:05.281
Chyna, you can't keep
the chicken forever!

10:05.282 --> 10:07.217
You have to feed the alligator.

10:07.218 --> 10:09.051
You're just jealous!

10:09.052 --> 10:13.323
Jealous of the friendship
that Eleanor and I have!

10:13.324 --> 10:18.094
Well, you did take her on a
hot air balloon ride and not me.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.296
Chyna, your problem is solved.

10:20.297 --> 10:21.964
I fed the alligator.

10:21.965 --> 10:24.457
What are you talking about? The
chicken is right here with me.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.918
I fed it the other chicken.

10:25.919 --> 10:28.104
- What other chicken?
- The water chicken.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.392
The water chicken?

10:29.393 --> 10:32.108
Yeah, with the webby feet?

10:32.109 --> 10:34.176
You mean the duck?

10:34.177 --> 10:38.214
Whatever it's called.
I'm not a urologist.

10:38.215 --> 10:41.150
Fletcher! That duck was
a scientific miracle.

10:41.151 --> 10:43.253
The world's only talking duck!

10:43.254 --> 10:46.489
Well, then it should have said something
when I was feeding it to the alligator.

10:46.490 --> 10:48.711
Like what? "I'm not a water chicken"

10:48.712 --> 10:50.827
"because there's no such
thing as water chickens!"

10:50.828 --> 10:54.428
Something in that area, sure.

10:59.398 --> 11:01.749
Seth is never going to forgive me!

11:01.750 --> 11:03.699
I agree.

11:03.700 --> 11:08.171
This is why I'm better
friends with the chicken.

11:08.172 --> 11:13.143
All right. It wasn't easy, but I
got us a replacement water chicken.

11:13.144 --> 11:15.664
It's a duck.

11:16.180 --> 11:17.682
And where did you get it?

11:17.683 --> 11:21.285
Just down the road at
Lake Warning-Do-Not-Swim.

11:21.286 --> 11:24.021
Are those leeches? Are you okay?

11:24.022 --> 11:26.323
Not really.

11:26.324 --> 11:30.428
They should probably put up
a warning sign by that lake.

11:30.429 --> 11:33.297
But this duck looks just like Daphne.

11:33.298 --> 11:36.233
Seth will never know the difference.

11:36.234 --> 11:38.454
(Quacking)

11:39.606 --> 11:43.106
Well, I do notice one difference.

11:43.107 --> 11:46.243
This duck doesn't speak English.

11:46.244 --> 11:51.248
Well, if Seth taught one duck to
speak, maybe we could teach this one.

11:51.249 --> 11:52.272
How?

11:52.273 --> 11:54.326
Obviously, we should start
with Latin because that

11:54.327 --> 11:57.387
will make it much easier
to learn other languages.

11:57.388 --> 12:00.290
Let's try speaking English to it first.

12:00.291 --> 12:03.393
<i>Bonjour, mon petit poulet d'eau.</i>

12:03.394 --> 12:05.128
Why are you speaking French?

12:05.129 --> 12:07.064
I don't know what I'm saying.

12:07.065 --> 12:10.545
I've lost a lot of blood.

12:13.647 --> 12:15.867
(Quacking)

12:17.442 --> 12:19.611
To make this phone
as simple as possible,

12:19.612 --> 12:23.380
I've stripped away all of
its complicated features.

12:23.381 --> 12:25.635
Though, by the look on
your face, I can tell you

12:25.636 --> 12:30.796
have no idea what "complicated"
or "features" mean.

12:31.155 --> 12:34.935
Anyway, tell me what you think.

12:37.095 --> 12:39.429
I don't like the way it tastes.

12:39.430 --> 12:42.132
You don't put a phone in your mouth.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.234
You hold it up to your ear.

12:44.235 --> 12:46.203
I can't taste it with my ear.

12:46.204 --> 12:48.171
It doesn't have taste buds.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.206
It has ear buds.

12:50.207 --> 12:54.396
I think that's enough
for today. Or for...

12:54.397 --> 12:56.246
Ever.

12:56.247 --> 12:58.281
But I have so many other ideas.

12:58.282 --> 13:00.481
Like, I'm always losing my phone,

13:00.482 --> 13:03.583
so maybe it should have legs
so it can follow me around.

13:03.584 --> 13:09.484
Also, every phone has a camera, but how
come none of them have a back scratcher?

13:09.862 --> 13:12.963
Of course! Why didn't I think of that?

13:12.964 --> 13:17.704
Oh, because oxygen
actually reaches my brain.

13:18.970 --> 13:23.470
I'm hungry. Want to join me for an MBA?

13:25.581 --> 13:29.013
Winter, I need to talk to
you. I have a huge problem.

13:29.014 --> 13:31.433
Walk it off.

13:31.434 --> 13:35.287
I haven't gotten to spend any
time with Paisley, my best friend.

13:35.288 --> 13:39.114
And I'm at a new school where all people
care about are the unimportant things,

13:39.115 --> 13:42.355
like how smart you are.

13:43.127 --> 13:48.465
Paisley's the only one who cares
what I'm like on the outside.

13:48.466 --> 13:52.534
Believe me, if I could
get rid of her, I would.

13:52.535 --> 13:57.140
She's ruining my design
with her ridiculous ideas.

13:57.141 --> 14:01.011
Well, maybe you should use her ideas.

14:01.012 --> 14:02.932
What?

14:03.281 --> 14:07.800
Incorporate all of Paisley's
suggestions, give her all the credit...

14:07.801 --> 14:11.508
And when the phone is horrible,
Mr. Grundy will fire her.

14:11.509 --> 14:14.124
That's a great idea!

14:14.125 --> 14:16.093
You're brilliant!

14:16.094 --> 14:18.228
Brilliant? Ugh!

14:18.229 --> 14:20.064
You're just like all the others!

14:20.065 --> 14:22.074
You'd think in this day
and age a girl could just

14:22.075 --> 14:26.995
be judged on her hair
and what she's wearing!

14:30.141 --> 14:33.044
Come on! Say something!

14:33.045 --> 14:35.729
Please talk to me!

14:35.730 --> 14:40.830
Hey, how did you know
Kevin James's pickup line?

14:41.185 --> 14:44.387
Hey, you're Chris Rock!

14:44.388 --> 14:47.148
It's Chris Rock!

14:47.358 --> 14:48.911
What are you doing here?

14:48.912 --> 14:51.454
Well, I'm looking for
Seth, that zoology kid.

14:51.455 --> 14:56.199
My daughters heard about those
puppenoalas and they just gotta have one.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.368
You know what kind of pet
I had when I was a kid?

14:58.369 --> 15:00.137
A rock.

15:00.138 --> 15:04.975
Yeah! Not a pet rock, just a
nasty old rock from the street.

15:04.976 --> 15:06.309
And I was happy to have her.

15:06.310 --> 15:08.245
Called her Roxie Rock.

15:08.246 --> 15:11.126
I loved that rock.

15:11.149 --> 15:12.718
How did you know it was a girl?

15:12.719 --> 15:15.418
I just knew, okay.

15:15.419 --> 15:18.022
Well, maybe we could
help each other out.

15:18.023 --> 15:21.959
I could put in a good word for you
with Seth, then, you could help me.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.160
Sounds great.

15:23.161 --> 15:25.195
Now, what can I help you with?

15:25.196 --> 15:27.297
Well, I'm trying to
get this duck to talk.

15:27.298 --> 15:29.818
Easy. Tell me what you
want the duck to say.

15:29.819 --> 15:32.623
I'll say it to the duck and
then he'll repeat it back to you.

15:32.624 --> 15:34.304
You really think that will work?

15:34.305 --> 15:37.207
That's how we get Rob
Schneider to do all his lines.

15:37.208 --> 15:39.848
You can do it!

15:43.148 --> 15:45.282
Mr. Grundy, allow me to present you with

15:45.283 --> 15:49.119
a prototype designed
exclusively by Paisley.

15:49.120 --> 15:53.290
Keep in mind, that this has all of
Paisley's ideas and none of mine.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.092
I had nothing to do with it.

15:55.093 --> 15:57.094
All her, no me.

15:57.095 --> 16:00.395
Her, ah-huh. Me, uh-uh.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.102
And I would like to add...

16:05.103 --> 16:06.570
Yes?

16:06.571 --> 16:08.479
That's it. I would like to add.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.341
I don't know how.

16:11.342 --> 16:15.045
As a teenage girl
with disposable income,

16:15.046 --> 16:18.148
I'm interested to see
how this phone works.

16:18.149 --> 16:20.435
I hope it's good and not a mish-mash

16:20.436 --> 16:26.016
of foolish ideas, all from
Paisley and none from Winter.

16:26.124 --> 16:30.160
With no further ado, I give
you the world's first...

16:30.161 --> 16:32.501
Dumb phone!

16:34.265 --> 16:36.166
A phone with legs?

16:36.167 --> 16:38.863
<i>Yes. Once again...</i>

16:38.864 --> 16:42.224
<i>Paisley, da. Winter, nyet.</i>

16:43.208 --> 16:46.009
But wait. Is there more?

16:46.010 --> 16:49.179
There is more. It tastes
like peanut butter.

16:49.180 --> 16:52.780
And behold! A back scratcher.

16:56.287 --> 17:01.024
This is the stupidest
thing I have ever seen.

17:01.025 --> 17:04.204
I couldn't agree more.

17:04.229 --> 17:07.097
No person on Earth would
ever want to use this phone.

17:07.098 --> 17:08.742
I certainly would not.

17:08.742 --> 17:13.527
But almost every person on
Earth already owns a Z-Phone.

17:13.528 --> 17:17.288
However, you know who
doesn't have phones?

17:17.289 --> 17:19.388
Animals!

17:19.467 --> 17:21.387
What?

17:22.046 --> 17:25.214
I've been wanting to expand
into the pet market for years.

17:25.215 --> 17:28.996
We finally found our Zoo-Phone!

17:30.054 --> 17:33.378
It has a peanut butter taste
that dogs find irresistible.

17:33.379 --> 17:36.568
Legs to take pets for a walk...

17:36.569 --> 17:40.709
And a hand to scratch their bellies.

17:40.965 --> 17:44.034
This is incredible, Paisley.

17:44.035 --> 17:47.070
You have the mind of a lower life form.

17:47.071 --> 17:50.371
You think like a poodle!

17:51.009 --> 17:53.586
- Thank you.
- Wait, not a poodle.

17:53.587 --> 17:57.526
Poodles are very intelligent.
What's a dumber dog?

17:57.527 --> 17:59.316
A chipmunk?

17:59.317 --> 18:00.831
Marvelous!

18:00.832 --> 18:03.954
I want to hire you for
my new products division.

18:03.955 --> 18:05.122
Division?

18:05.123 --> 18:08.192
I can't do division. I can't even add!

18:08.193 --> 18:09.675
Don't worry.

18:09.676 --> 18:15.065
You'll be working hand in hand
with a remarkably intelligent...

18:15.066 --> 18:16.986
Duck.

18:17.969 --> 18:20.309
Mr. Grundy!

18:21.459 --> 18:23.941
Did I mention this
phone was all my idea?

18:23.942 --> 18:26.276
I just gave Paisley all
the credit because...

18:26.277 --> 18:29.379
- Because...
- Because you care about young people!

18:29.380 --> 18:34.017
That's why Den Mother is
the perfect position for you.

18:34.018 --> 18:37.321
Sir, I have a big problem with this.

18:37.322 --> 18:39.782
Walk it off.

18:41.125 --> 18:44.962
This is great! Now I'll be around more.

18:44.963 --> 18:48.232
What's the point of having you around
if you don't spend any time with me?

18:48.233 --> 18:51.644
I've been reduced to getting
compliments from strangers.

18:51.645 --> 18:56.139
Yes, it happens all the
time, but it's not the same.

18:56.140 --> 18:58.175
Don't worry, Lexi.

18:58.176 --> 19:00.177
I'll still be here for you.

19:00.178 --> 19:02.938
I made your bed.

19:09.153 --> 19:13.023
Olive! Check it out! I
thought the duck how to speak.

19:13.024 --> 19:15.662
Every town has the same two lakes...

19:15.663 --> 19:20.230
The one swans go to, and
the one swans used to go to.

19:20.231 --> 19:21.999
Chyna.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.202
Forget it, Chris. She's not buying it.

19:25.203 --> 19:26.178
That's Chris...

19:26.179 --> 19:29.973
Yeah, yeah. It's Chris
Rock. Now can we focus?

19:29.974 --> 19:33.176
Seth said he'll be back at
eight, which only gives us...

19:33.177 --> 19:35.279
No time!

19:35.280 --> 19:37.948
Seth! What are you doing here?

19:37.949 --> 19:40.666
Why are you back so early?
Why didn't you call me?

19:40.667 --> 19:42.737
Why don't you go answer
these and many other

19:42.738 --> 19:45.289
questions on a long
walk far away from here?

19:45.290 --> 19:47.257
We finished our rescue operation early.

19:47.258 --> 19:49.293
We gave the bald eagle a hair transplant

19:49.294 --> 19:51.962
and he's feeling much
better about himself.

19:51.963 --> 19:55.623
Hey, Daphne! Did you miss me?

19:57.268 --> 19:59.036
She seems different.

19:59.037 --> 20:01.033
Yes. She is very upset.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.595
She heard that you left
her to be with another bird.

20:03.596 --> 20:06.416
Ooh, that's cold.

20:07.145 --> 20:08.738
Exactly!

20:08.739 --> 20:12.115
She told me she was probably going
to give you the silent treatment.

20:12.116 --> 20:14.384
Possibly forever.

20:14.385 --> 20:16.353
She told you that?

20:16.354 --> 20:17.502
Let me talk to her.

20:17.503 --> 20:21.942
Uh... sorry, she's only
speaking to me right now.

20:21.943 --> 20:23.670
What's that, Daphne?

20:23.671 --> 20:27.271
Uh-huh. Oh, I got it, okay.

20:27.298 --> 20:30.067
Well, Daphne said that even
though she's mad at you,

20:30.068 --> 20:32.135
I did a great job taking
care of all the animals

20:32.136 --> 20:34.371
and I totally deserve a puppenoala.

20:34.372 --> 20:36.952
(Clears throat)

20:37.008 --> 20:40.110
Oh, yeah, and Chris
Rock deserves one too.

20:40.111 --> 20:43.213
Wow, I'm really surprised she said that.

20:43.214 --> 20:44.754
Why?

20:44.755 --> 20:47.365
Because ducks can't speak.

20:47.366 --> 20:49.549
It's physiologically impossible.

20:49.550 --> 20:54.453
That's what the doctor said about Rob
Schneider but we sort of proved them wrong.

20:54.454 --> 20:57.557
But, you said you
taught Daphne to speak.

20:57.558 --> 21:00.593
No, I said I taught her to communicate.

21:00.594 --> 21:02.206
She just quacks.

21:02.207 --> 21:03.891
Once for "yes," twice for "no,"

21:03.892 --> 21:09.402
and seventeen times for, "move it,
nerd! Your standing on my foot!"

21:09.403 --> 21:12.572
My point is, she could
never speak English.

21:12.573 --> 21:16.141
Well, she can now. It's a miracle!

21:16.142 --> 21:17.510
What's that Daphne?

21:17.511 --> 21:18.578
(Quacking)

21:18.579 --> 21:21.699
She said, "hallelujah!"

21:22.987 --> 21:24.985
What's going on, Chyna?

21:24.986 --> 21:27.626
And Chris Rock?

21:29.485 --> 21:32.554
Look, Seth, I'm sorry. I messed up.

21:32.555 --> 21:34.422
This isn't Daphne.

21:34.423 --> 21:38.064
I don't know how to tell you
this, but because of me...

21:38.065 --> 21:40.495
We accidentally fed
Daphne to the alligator.

21:40.496 --> 21:44.954
Now, keep in mind, this
was all Chyna's fault.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.469
Not mine. I had nothing to do with it.

21:47.470 --> 21:49.548
All her, no me.

21:49.549 --> 21:52.849
Her, ah-huh, me, uh-uh.

21:54.842 --> 21:56.010
Daphne!

21:56.011 --> 21:58.231
(Quacking)

21:59.290 --> 22:00.955
You're alive!

22:00.956 --> 22:02.303
How did this happen?

22:02.304 --> 22:05.587
When Fletcher put Daphne in with
the alligator, she must've escaped.

22:05.588 --> 22:07.008
Is that right, Daphne?

22:07.009 --> 22:08.222
(Quacks once)

22:08.223 --> 22:11.040
That makes perfect sense.
Fletcher can't do anything right.

22:11.041 --> 22:13.204
He even messes up at messing up.

22:13.205 --> 22:14.629
Isn't that right!

22:14.630 --> 22:16.216
(Quacks once)

22:16.217 --> 22:18.879
Seth, I'm sorry I lied to you.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.425
Can you forgive me?

22:20.426 --> 22:22.209
Well...

22:22.210 --> 22:26.508
My animals seem like they were
pretty well cared for, so, sure.

22:26.509 --> 22:29.923
And if you still want a
puppenoala, you can have one.

22:29.924 --> 22:35.047
You should know, however,
that they feast on human flesh.

22:35.048 --> 22:37.238
Okay, I'll pass.

22:37.239 --> 22:40.074
But thank you for not being angry.

22:40.075 --> 22:43.278
And I'm sure Daphne here
forgives me too, right?

22:43.279 --> 22:45.799
(Quacks twice)

22:46.115 --> 22:49.648
Ooh, ooh. Let me ask
this duck a question.

22:49.649 --> 22:52.345
Am I funnier than Adam Sandler?

22:52.346 --> 22:53.244
- (Quacks once)
- Wow.

22:53.245 --> 22:55.475
Not only is this duck smart...

22:55.476 --> 22:58.536
It's got good taste.

23:01.030 --> 23:02.411
Guess what?

23:02.412 --> 23:08.312
I told Chris Rock what a big fan I was and
that I was interested in doing stand-up.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.072
You? Do stand-up?

23:11.073 --> 23:13.908
You can barely stand up.

23:13.909 --> 23:19.113
Anyway, he said I should give it
a shot, so I put together an act.

23:19.114 --> 23:21.634
Check it out!

23:23.613 --> 23:27.451
(In high-pitched voice) My husband
always complains he's hen-pecked.

23:27.452 --> 23:32.657
Well, if he doesn't want to be hen-pecked,
he shouldn't have married a chicken.

23:32.658 --> 23:33.961
Ha-ha!

23:33.962 --> 23:36.273
La, la, la...

23:36.274 --> 23:37.916
La, la.

23:37.917 --> 23:42.047
I can't believe I paid a ten
