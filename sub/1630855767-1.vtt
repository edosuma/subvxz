00:01.484 --> 00:04.661
[♪]

00:17.239 --> 00:19.850
[Brewer] Where am I?
[cloth ripping off]

00:20.025 --> 00:22.070
[Julia] Couple miles outside of
Corp-Gov jurisdiction.

00:22.244 --> 00:24.072
[Giselle] Somewhere safe.

00:24.246 --> 00:26.770
What is this?!
Release me immediately!

00:26.944 --> 00:28.337
[Brewer] Do you know who I am?!

00:28.511 --> 00:30.165
Michael Brewer.

00:30.339 --> 00:33.386
Born 2011, no children,
widower...

00:33.560 --> 00:34.996
My condolences.

00:35.170 --> 00:36.737
[Julia] You've been employed
by Wrightcorp

00:36.911 --> 00:38.652
since practically the beginning.

00:38.826 --> 00:40.349
Making nuclear energy
innovations

00:40.523 --> 00:44.266
until transitioning
into the development

00:44.440 --> 00:46.573
and commercialization of--

00:46.747 --> 00:51.012
[violent coughing]
[wheezing]

00:51.186 --> 00:52.622
Artificial gravity engines,
which--

00:52.796 --> 00:55.669
[continued coughing]

00:56.322 --> 00:58.672
Which brings us to your
business with us.

00:58.846 --> 01:00.587
I'll have no business with you!

01:00.761 --> 01:02.197
Oh no?

01:02.371 --> 01:04.852
I don't do business
with infected criminals!

01:05.026 --> 01:07.724
Rest assured, Mr. Brewer

01:07.898 --> 01:09.509
the infection in our
lungs has not

01:09.683 --> 01:11.902
infected our business integrity.

01:12.077 --> 01:14.862
[rattling, wet cough]

01:15.036 --> 01:17.299
[whimpering inhale]

01:17.473 --> 01:20.998
[continued coughing]

01:28.049 --> 01:31.226
Between us, Mr. Brewer

01:31.400 --> 01:34.360
I think this might be her
last business trip.

01:34.534 --> 01:36.927
[Brewer] Look, if it's ransom
money you want

01:37.102 --> 01:38.190
the company's insurance policy
will more than--

01:38.364 --> 01:40.931
You can't buy what we
want, Mr. Brewer.

01:41.106 --> 01:43.238
You can only take it.

01:43.412 --> 01:45.762
Who-- who are you?

01:45.936 --> 01:48.156
[Edgar] Who am I?

01:48.330 --> 01:50.767
I'm not that different from you,
Mr. Brewer.

01:50.941 --> 01:53.640
We both serve a purpose.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.208
You serve a company;
you're a company man.

01:57.296 --> 01:59.820
I serve the people.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.170
So, I guess that makes me a--

02:04.129 --> 02:06.566
I guess that makes me
a people person.

02:07.915 --> 02:09.395
Oh, god.

02:09.569 --> 02:10.831
Are you--

02:11.005 --> 02:12.963
Are you People's Army?

02:13.138 --> 02:16.663
[Edgar] By stifling the voice of
the "infected" as you call us.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.405
[Edgar] Wrightcorp has
driven us toward desperation.

02:20.971 --> 02:22.930
And violence.

02:23.104 --> 02:25.280
In that way, I suppose

02:25.454 --> 02:28.065
your company has
criminalized change.

02:28.240 --> 02:30.024
[Brewer] Look, I-- I--
I'm sorry

02:30.198 --> 02:31.417
for what's happened to you.

02:31.591 --> 02:32.592
To all of you.

02:32.766 --> 02:34.550
I-- I really am.

02:34.724 --> 02:36.509
But none of that is my fault.

02:36.683 --> 02:37.771
No.

02:37.945 --> 02:39.903
That's true.

02:40.077 --> 02:43.342
You're just a symptom of a
much larger disease.

02:43.516 --> 02:45.039
But we have a cure for that.

02:45.213 --> 02:46.867
[Brewer] No, no, no no no no,
no! Please!

02:47.041 --> 02:48.738
[Brewer] No no no, listen, I,
I can't get--

02:48.912 --> 02:49.826
Please!

02:50.000 --> 02:53.047
[Ramone] Shhhhhh...

02:53.221 --> 02:56.485
Your air is precious now.

02:56.659 --> 02:57.791
[mask peeling off]
[air releasing]

02:57.965 --> 02:59.445
[sharp inhale]

03:01.490 --> 03:03.013
Now...

03:03.188 --> 03:05.190
I need to know where
Wrightcorp is developing the

03:05.364 --> 03:07.061
new gravity free-gen tech.

03:07.235 --> 03:09.977
[EDGAR] The good compact stuff,
you know what I'm talking about.

03:10.151 --> 03:11.196
[Edgar] So, Ramone here

03:11.370 --> 03:13.198
will hold on to your mask

03:13.372 --> 03:15.461
until you tell us.

03:17.811 --> 03:20.117
[Edgar] Now you have no voice.

03:22.337 --> 03:24.600
Now your every breath
is precious.

03:24.774 --> 03:26.428
[Brewer] [sputters air]

03:26.602 --> 03:29.301
[Edgar] How much longer until
you're the infected criminal?

03:34.393 --> 03:36.264
[hard exhale] Alright!

03:36.438 --> 03:38.048
[Brewer] There's a testing
bunker under

03:38.223 --> 03:39.659
the building at 1038 Shine
Street!

03:39.833 --> 03:41.878
Shine Street!
1038!

03:42.052 --> 03:44.664
They-- they store prototypes
and compact systems

03:44.838 --> 03:46.448
in different stages
of development.

03:46.622 --> 03:48.320
But you need special clearance!

03:48.494 --> 03:50.713
Who controls clearance?
[Brewer] Grav-tech

03:50.887 --> 03:53.020
department heads and earth-bound
security techs!

03:53.194 --> 03:54.326
Names, Michael!

03:56.066 --> 03:57.024
I need names.

03:57.198 --> 03:59.722
[heavy coughing]

03:59.896 --> 04:01.507
Larson! Howard Larson!

04:01.681 --> 04:03.944
Larson's the work-from-Earth
CSO.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.512
[Brewer] He can generate keys
and passes, whatever.

04:06.686 --> 04:09.297
He runs ground and
orbital security operations

04:09.471 --> 04:11.430
from his compound on Earth.

04:11.604 --> 04:13.388
Look I-- I can help you!

04:13.562 --> 04:15.434
Just please give me
my mask back, please!

04:15.608 --> 04:18.654
I-- I can't get A.C.H.E.

04:18.828 --> 04:20.700
Wright will take everything from
me!

04:26.227 --> 04:27.663
[confused grunt]

04:28.882 --> 04:30.753
[Brewer] Oh no-- no no no no
don't do--

04:30.927 --> 04:32.233
No, don't do this!

04:32.407 --> 04:34.757
No look, I--
I'm worth more to you alive!

04:34.931 --> 04:36.542
[Brewer] [whimpering]
Please.... no...

04:36.716 --> 04:38.370

Sportscaster] --got a hell of a
show for you folks tonight

05:32.206 --> 05:34.426
The two-year running MVP Nick
"The Iceman" Donovan

05:34.600 --> 05:36.210
will be joining us, remotely of
course

05:36.384 --> 05:38.604
to discuss his short-lived but
exceptional career

05:38.778 --> 05:41.128
as the premiere pitcher in the
Infected Baseball League

05:41.302 --> 05:43.173
and what his failing health can
teach

05:43.348 --> 05:45.045
other top-tier infected athletes

05:45.219 --> 05:47.221
about ACHE, and the impact that
repeated outbreaks

05:47.395 --> 05:48.396
might have on their careers.

05:48.570 --> 05:50.224
Donovan made headlines in 2053

05:50.398 --> 05:52.792
after his infected status meant
he had to drop out of the MLB

05:52.966 --> 05:54.620
sparking controversy when--
[static]

05:54.794 --> 05:57.449
[Nova] This is Nova Grave, and
thanks for tuning your auditory

05:57.623 --> 05:59.538
implants on tonight's edition
of Graveyard Shift.

05:59.712 --> 06:01.670
[Graveyard Shift jingle intro]

06:01.844 --> 06:03.455
[spooky voice]
Gra-a-a-aveyard Shift!

06:03.629 --> 06:05.718
[creepy voice] They're trying to
cut me!

06:05.892 --> 06:08.198
[Nova] Anyway this morning I
wake up, have a cup of coffee

06:08.373 --> 06:10.331
and start coughing blood out my
nose.

06:10.505 --> 06:12.420
Nothin' new, I know,
just another Tuesday

06:12.594 --> 06:14.944
in the good ol' U-S-of-ACHE.

06:15.118 --> 06:17.338
Except this time the blood's
some thick, purple color

06:17.512 --> 06:18.774
so, you know, hell with it

06:18.948 --> 06:20.646
I figure I'll stop by one of
those new

06:20.820 --> 06:23.562
Wrightcorp-sponsored health
clinics before I get here

06:23.736 --> 06:26.173
to the studio to do the
morning's 'Early Grave'.

06:26.347 --> 06:28.567
So they stick me with this newly
infected doctor

06:28.741 --> 06:29.959
real piece of shit

06:30.133 --> 06:32.571
who tells me that my particular
version of the

06:32.745 --> 06:34.790
Airborne Chronic Hemorrhagic
Syndrome

06:34.964 --> 06:37.663
is the earliest recorded
variant! [crowd cheering]

06:37.837 --> 06:39.969
[Nova] Meaning I am one of
the O.G. recipients

06:40.143 --> 06:41.971
of humanity's favorite plague.

06:42.145 --> 06:44.452
And one of the last O.G.s still
living.

06:44.626 --> 06:47.803
If you call life without a
non-exposure license "living".

06:47.977 --> 06:49.631
[digital HUD noises]

06:49.805 --> 06:51.894
[Nova] Maybe they'll take me up
to their fancy space station

06:52.068 --> 06:54.331
do some tests and I'll get to
meet a fine, uninfected lady

06:54.506 --> 06:56.943
with a thing for full-body,
airtight, rubber suits.

08:58.499 --> 08:59.892
[Edgar] Ah, looks like you got
in okay.

09:00.066 --> 09:00.936
You burn him?

09:01.110 --> 09:02.503
Yeah.

09:02.677 --> 09:04.592
[Edgar] Mmmm. Bet that smelled
ripe.

09:04.766 --> 09:06.594
I-- I mean I wouldn't know.
-Ah, right.

09:06.768 --> 09:08.553
I'm glad I don't have to wear
one of

09:08.727 --> 09:10.380
those things on my face
anymore.

09:10.555 --> 09:13.166
One of the benefits of having
a debilitating lung infection.

09:13.340 --> 09:15.734
You people with your masks are
missing all the smells of this

09:15.908 --> 09:17.562
brave new world.

09:19.302 --> 09:21.174
Okay, do we have login
credentials?

09:21.348 --> 09:22.697
All we had was the housekeeper.

09:22.871 --> 09:24.264
And you.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.918
She doesn't know where he keeps
his private stuff?

09:26.092 --> 09:27.833
Not that kind of housekeeper.

09:28.007 --> 09:30.139
[Edgar] Guess you're gonna have
to work your magic.

09:30.313 --> 09:31.576
[rapid typing]

09:31.750 --> 09:33.316
How'd you get her to
cooperate anyway?

09:33.490 --> 09:34.753
[Edgar] That's need-to-know.

09:34.927 --> 09:36.798
[James] Well, I 'need-to-know'
if she's gonna

09:36.972 --> 09:38.583
tip off anybody at Wrightcorp.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.803
Her brother works for me.

09:41.977 --> 09:43.588
She's not gonna tell anyone
anything--

09:43.762 --> 09:44.806
Wait, she's infected?!

09:44.980 --> 09:46.765
[Edgar] No! Her brother has the
aches...

09:46.939 --> 09:49.594
She doesn't. The house is clean.

09:50.943 --> 09:51.944
[Edgar] Look

09:52.118 --> 09:53.815
You don't know me yet.

09:53.989 --> 09:56.557
But you're gonna have to trust
me if you wanna get paid.

09:56.731 --> 09:57.993
This is how I work.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.387
You'll get used to it.

10:00.561 --> 10:03.216
[deep exhale]

10:03.390 --> 10:04.739
Well what's wrong with this guy
then?

10:04.913 --> 10:06.175
If he doesn't have A.C.H.E. then

10:06.349 --> 10:07.568
why's he gotta stay grounded?

10:07.742 --> 10:09.135
[Edgar] What do you mean?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.050
[James] I mean you'd think
they'd house their

10:11.224 --> 10:12.573
security team on the space
station.

10:12.747 --> 10:14.357
[scoff] Please.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.621
A one-bedroom apartment up there
goes for a billion dollars.

10:16.795 --> 10:18.361
You think they're gonna give the
real estate

10:18.535 --> 10:19.972
to house a keyboard monkey?
-Hey.

10:20.146 --> 10:21.234
[Edgar] I'm just saying

10:21.408 --> 10:23.236
they outsource everything down
here

10:23.410 --> 10:25.586
while they grow daffodils in
artificial gravity

10:25.760 --> 10:26.979
and shit in golden toilets.

10:27.153 --> 10:28.589
[grunts]

10:28.763 --> 10:30.243
Yeah, kinda makes the wealth
disparity between

10:30.417 --> 10:33.550
your people and my people pale
in comparison, doesn't it?

10:33.725 --> 10:35.422
Sure.

10:38.991 --> 10:40.427
[hard keystroke]
[access chime]

10:40.601 --> 10:42.255
And we're in.

10:42.429 --> 10:43.996
[Edgar] Cool. Look for anything
confidential or classified.

10:44.170 --> 10:45.693
Wait. Hold on. Dude.

10:45.867 --> 10:47.956
This is a very sophisticated
system, okay there's

10:48.130 --> 10:50.655
multiple firewalls, honeypots,
subsystem dead-ends that--

10:53.092 --> 10:55.007
The point is, I'm not going to
make all that go away.

10:55.181 --> 10:56.748
It's gonna take days.

10:56.922 --> 10:58.663
Which...

10:58.837 --> 11:00.665
is enough time for somebody at
Wrightcorp to notice a certain

11:00.839 --> 11:03.711
recently fired employee
not doing his job.

11:03.885 --> 11:06.453
[Edgar] I'm guessing you have a
plan for that.

Hi there! This is Howard Larson!

11:34.089 --> 11:36.135
I just want everyone to know
that I spent

11:36.309 --> 11:38.746
my life working for a spineless,
wack-job multi-trillionaire

11:38.920 --> 11:41.053

I have no conscience.

11:41.227 --> 11:42.576
And, in death

11:42.750 --> 11:44.317
I am a traitor to my

send that to anyone.

11:52.107 --> 11:53.935
I should be able to do all of
Howard's busy work remotely now.

11:54.109 --> 11:56.242
No one will ask any questions.

You're every bit as good

in 2043

12:47.423 --> 12:49.643
the world's foremost energy

12:49.817 --> 12:51.558

12:51.732 --> 12:53.995
Including national defense

12:57.259 --> 12:59.392
Hi! I'm William Wright.

12:59.566 --> 13:02.134
Now the world has undoubtedly
changed over the last decade.

And a global health crisis.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.227
But the earth as it was

13:08.401 --> 13:10.795
still lives inside each and

13:10.969 --> 13:11.970
In our hearts.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.952

13:38.126 --> 13:39.432

13:39.606 --> 13:42.217

13:45.568 --> 13:46.961

13:47.135 --> 13:49.007
we have brought the
unemployment rate down

13:49.181 --> 13:51.052
to nearly zero.

13:51.226 --> 13:53.011
So, from the lab tech in orbit

21:44.177 --> 21:45.396
[rifle activating]

21:45.570 --> 21:47.441
Follow.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.055
[Ayla] Now!

21:53.229 --> 21:54.405
[over PA] [Wilhelmj's "Air on
the G String"]

21:54.579 --> 21:56.058
[Ayla] Bullshit.
-Not bullshit.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.669
You don't act like a computer
program.

21:57.843 --> 21:59.845
Well then I'd say somebody did a
very good job.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.107
I've developed A.I.

22:01.281 --> 22:02.543
You don't fit the bill.
-How's that?

22:02.717 --> 22:03.849
You're missing the "I".

22:04.023 --> 22:06.808
[James] Oh! Haha! Good one!

22:06.982 --> 22:09.245
[James] Well, I'm something of a
rarity actually.

22:09.420 --> 22:12.292
I've been relegated to a normal,
human cognitive wavelength

22:12.466 --> 22:14.729
and imprisoned here within your
simulation.

22:14.903 --> 22:16.862
Yeah this whole simulation is
sort of like

22:17.036 --> 22:18.559
robot jail for me.

22:18.733 --> 22:20.169
I guess I got a little out of
control.

22:20.344 --> 22:22.041
Out of control?

22:22.215 --> 22:23.521
[James] But my memory banks were
wiped after whatever happened

22:23.695 --> 22:25.479
so I have no recollection of the
incident.

22:25.653 --> 22:27.307
[Ayla] Incident?
-Mmhmm.

22:27.481 --> 22:30.441
But, like I said... [whooshing
noise]

22:30.615 --> 22:31.833
[chuckle]

22:32.007 --> 22:33.922
Man...

22:34.096 --> 22:36.316
[James] You did all of this?

22:36.490 --> 22:38.492
Y-- yeah.

22:38.666 --> 22:40.276
Wow.

22:40.451 --> 22:42.453
[snort] I like the little
wingdings.

22:42.627 --> 22:43.976
Why do you look like that?

22:44.150 --> 22:46.282
Look like what?

22:47.327 --> 22:49.416
[James] Well this avatar was
just randomly assigned to me

22:49.590 --> 22:50.678
by my programming but, uh--

22:50.852 --> 22:52.288
If you'd like I can take the
shape of

22:52.463 --> 22:53.681
whatever your heart desires.

22:53.855 --> 22:55.466
Goat?!
-But--!

22:55.640 --> 22:57.468
It is unlikely that I will be
randomly assigned this

22:57.642 --> 23:00.384
particular avatar again, so...

23:04.866 --> 23:06.085
Eh.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.522
You can stay like that I guess.

23:08.696 --> 23:10.394
Awesome.

23:14.441 --> 23:17.357
So what is this supposed to be?

23:17.531 --> 23:19.664
What does it look like to you?

23:19.838 --> 23:22.928
Uh... Well, um...

23:23.102 --> 23:26.061
It's kinda got me thinking...

23:26.235 --> 23:28.542
I'm seeing a...

23:28.716 --> 23:30.675
I'm feeling.

23:30.849 --> 23:31.893
You know?

23:32.067 --> 23:33.417
Mmm. Yeah.

23:33.591 --> 23:35.767
[James] Mmmm.

23:35.941 --> 23:38.813
-That's what I was going for.
-Oh. Good.

23:38.987 --> 23:41.337
[Ayla] It's the transition
out of my blue period.

23:41.512 --> 23:43.252
[James] Right. Naturally.

23:43.427 --> 23:46.734
[Ayla] Honestly I haven't
worked on any of this in awhile.

23:46.908 --> 23:48.344
Why, you've been working on your

23:48.519 --> 23:50.346
big dangerous engine thing?

23:50.521 --> 23:52.958
What are you really doing here?!
-Your father assigned me

23:53.132 --> 23:54.307
the prestigious job of

23:54.481 --> 23:55.743
keeping you company--
-[mock buzzer]

23:55.917 --> 23:56.962
[Ayla] Wrong answer!

23:57.136 --> 23:59.704
Would you like to play again?

23:59.878 --> 24:00.966
Okay.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.098
My alternate functionality is

24:03.272 --> 24:04.273
[James] as a...

24:04.448 --> 24:05.231
security monitor.

24:05.405 --> 24:07.059
I knew it!

24:07.233 --> 24:09.453
[James] Yes, my charming
personality and witty banter

24:09.627 --> 24:11.150
serve as a fluffy cushion
surrounding my

24:11.324 --> 24:13.587
anti-malware and digital
policing protocols.

24:13.761 --> 24:15.110
[Ayla] Policing! [sarcastic
laugh]

24:15.284 --> 24:16.677
Well that's fun.

24:16.851 --> 24:18.592
Well hey, I think I deserve some
credit though.

24:18.766 --> 24:20.420
-Yeah? Why's that?
-I am programmed

24:20.594 --> 24:22.204
to lie to you about my
functionality.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.206
Well that makes me feel so much
better!

24:24.380 --> 24:26.687
[James] I just thought you
deserved to know the truth.

24:26.861 --> 24:28.646
[Ayla] And how exactly are you
able to

24:28.820 --> 24:30.604
circumvent your behavioral
programming?

24:32.519 --> 24:34.129
I guess I'm a little fucked up.

24:34.303 --> 24:35.566
[scoffs]

24:35.740 --> 24:38.003
Yeah. I'd say so.

24:48.666 --> 24:50.102
K Bye.

24:50.276 --> 24:51.843
Oh! Uh...

24:52.017 --> 24:53.801
Well it has been a pleasure
making your acquaintan--

24:53.975 --> 24:55.368
[laser rifle arming]
[James] --nnce.

24:55.542 --> 24:57.457
Okay.

25:00.547 --> 25:01.679
Wait!

25:02.636 --> 25:04.812
[Ayla] Where are you gonna be?

25:04.986 --> 25:05.944
[James] Oh I donno. Just

25:06.118 --> 25:07.598
around.

25:07.772 --> 25:08.947
I live here now

25:09.121 --> 25:10.514
so...

25:22.221 --> 25:24.266
[grinding digital transition]

25:26.007 --> 25:27.443
[surprised laugh]

25:27.618 --> 25:28.575
[James] And she's adorable!

25:28.749 --> 25:30.185
[Edgar] This is amazing.

25:30.359 --> 25:32.492
A little on the angry side but
that's probably

25:32.666 --> 25:33.841
just cabin fever--
-This is exactly

25:34.015 --> 25:36.017
the kind of thing we're looking
for. Now we

25:36.191 --> 25:38.193
can leverage this information--
-I know, I know

25:38.367 --> 25:40.282
I need to keep building trust,
pick her brain

25:40.456 --> 25:42.067
for information--
-You talked to her?!

25:42.241 --> 25:43.068
You saw her picture

25:43.242 --> 25:44.460
of course I talked to her.

25:44.635 --> 25:46.245
[Edgar] What were you thinking?!

25:46.419 --> 25:48.464
If Wright gets wind of
anything that we're doing

25:48.639 --> 25:50.118
we're done!
-It's fine man!

25:50.292 --> 25:51.859
I've developed a solid alter
ego.

25:52.033 --> 25:53.208
I'm basically like

25:53.382 --> 25:54.949
if James Bond was a phishing
scam.

25:55.123 --> 25:56.690
[Edgar] The number of people
relying on you

25:56.864 --> 25:57.996
not to fuck this up--

25:58.170 --> 25:59.214
[James] [heavy sigh] Dude.
Relax.

25:59.388 --> 26:00.520
[digital whoosh]

26:00.694 --> 26:02.304
She thinks I'm her imaginary
friend.

26:02.478 --> 26:05.003
Besides I think you're gonna
want in on this doohickey she's

26:05.177 --> 26:07.048
developing in her VR simulation.
-Doohickey?

26:07.222 --> 26:09.442
Yeah. Looks like she's doing
R&amp;D on some

26:09.616 --> 26:11.270
engine prototype.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.880
Looks complicated.

26:13.054 --> 26:14.708
[Edgar] [ironic laugh] Must run
in the family.

26:14.882 --> 26:16.667
Billy Wright is perpetually
finding new ways to

26:16.841 --> 26:18.277
suck the energy from under us.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.279
Do you know how much fuel
my drivers deliver

26:20.453 --> 26:21.715
to that goddamn station?
-Uh...

26:21.889 --> 26:23.587
Fifty terrawatt hours of nuclear
batteries

26:23.761 --> 26:25.589
and carbon biofuels every month?

26:25.763 --> 26:27.547
[Edgar] Yeah that's exactly
right.

26:27.721 --> 26:29.723
I know! Dude I'm going through
pages and pages of

26:29.897 --> 26:31.551
data in there man.
-Of course.

26:31.725 --> 26:33.988
Wrightcorp is covering up so
many flaws in its

26:34.162 --> 26:36.730
fuel storage and delivery
protocols man, it...

26:36.904 --> 26:38.123
[James] It's vile.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.341
You're tellin' me.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.734
[James] What's it like handling

26:40.908 --> 26:42.606
fuel shuttle dispatch knowing
that

26:42.780 --> 26:46.479
30% of your employees develop
acute radiation syndrome?

26:46.653 --> 26:50.222
You learn to be very convincing.

26:50.396 --> 26:53.355
[Edgar] You know what... I trust
you with the Wright girl.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.575
You've been doing a good job so
far and...

26:55.749 --> 26:58.099
I don't see any reason why
you can't handle it your way.

26:58.273 --> 26:59.318
I appreciate that.

26:59.492 --> 27:00.928
[Edgar] I just have one
question.

27:01.102 --> 27:02.756
What's that?

27:02.930 --> 27:05.498
Why are you helping us?

27:06.542 --> 27:09.284
Uhhh, because you offered
to pay me six million dollars?

27:09.458 --> 27:12.548
[Edgar] Right, but...

27:12.723 --> 27:13.767
"Acheys"...

27:13.941 --> 27:15.769
killed your family.

27:18.729 --> 27:21.166
Yeah but...

27:21.340 --> 27:24.082
It's not like they meant to.

27:24.256 --> 27:26.388
And besides it's people like
Wright that made infected

27:26.562 --> 27:28.956
citizens desperate enough to
ignore quarantine protocols

27:29.130 --> 27:30.610
and riot, so...

27:30.784 --> 27:33.091
[James] You wanna rob him?
Be my guest.

27:33.265 --> 27:35.484
I'm happy I can use my non-
exposure privilege to help out

27:35.659 --> 27:37.486
essential workers and

27:37.661 --> 27:38.400
ya know--

27:38.574 --> 27:41.360
people with A.C.H.E.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.015
Money's nice too.

27:44.189 --> 27:46.539
Money's very nice.

27:46.713 --> 27:48.715
Well...

27:48.889 --> 27:52.371
It's nice to have you on board.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.416
[end-transmission chime]

28:44.249 --> 28:45.467
[Ayla] Jesus Christ!

28:45.641 --> 28:47.295
[James] You have an Emily Bronte
poem

28:47.469 --> 28:49.428
graffitied in your art
mausoleum.

28:49.602 --> 28:50.995
I'm aware. Thank you!

28:51.169 --> 28:52.910
[James] That part of your blue
period?

28:53.084 --> 28:55.434
Ah, that was my Heathcliff
phase.

28:55.608 --> 28:56.870
[James] I don't get it.

28:57.044 --> 28:58.437
Wuthering Heights?

28:58.611 --> 29:01.135
[James] Gesundheit!

29:01.309 --> 29:04.748
[James] "I am the only
being whose doom

29:04.922 --> 29:08.055
No tongue would ask,
no eye would mourn

29:08.229 --> 29:10.884
I never caused a thought of
gloom

29:11.058 --> 29:13.844
A smile of joy since I was
born."

29:14.018 --> 29:15.584
What, do you have this
memorized?!

29:15.759 --> 29:16.629
Uh, yeah.

29:16.803 --> 29:18.718
I have lots of stuff memorized.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.633
[Ayla] Well, I am not about to
take

29:20.807 --> 29:23.549
literary criticism from a, um...

29:23.723 --> 29:25.290
glorified firewall.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.682
[scoff] Come on!

29:26.857 --> 29:27.858
I like it!

29:28.032 --> 29:30.034
It's misanthropic, depressing--

29:30.208 --> 29:32.776
Emo.

29:32.950 --> 29:35.517
Don't worry I've moved out
of my teenage years.

29:36.823 --> 29:38.520
Man...

29:38.694 --> 29:41.219
How long have you been up here?

29:41.393 --> 29:43.308
Ummm...

29:43.482 --> 29:46.528
I was eleven when I first
collapsed.

29:46.702 --> 29:49.183
and everybody thought that I had
gravity sickness, and then

29:49.357 --> 29:51.969
I was in and out of the hospital
until I was thirteen?

29:52.143 --> 29:53.666
And that's when they discovered
that I

29:53.840 --> 29:55.450
have a rare allergy to the

29:55.624 --> 29:57.191
hybrid plants

29:57.365 --> 29:59.150
they use to filter the air on
the main station.

29:59.324 --> 30:00.281
Oooooh. Damn.

30:00.455 --> 30:01.761
Yeah. So

30:01.935 --> 30:03.632
rather than have me spend my
eighth grade

30:03.807 --> 30:05.896
with my lungs on fire

30:06.070 --> 30:07.549
My dad decided to

30:07.723 --> 30:09.334
invest in a, um

30:09.508 --> 30:10.683
remote facility.

30:10.857 --> 30:12.685
[James] So eighth grade...

30:12.859 --> 30:14.339
well, you know...

30:14.513 --> 30:16.645
at least you got out
before your awkward phase.

30:16.820 --> 30:19.518
[emphatic snorting]

30:19.692 --> 30:21.694
[James] [laughing]

30:21.868 --> 30:23.391

30:23.565 --> 30:25.393
[James] [continued laughter]

30:26.525 --> 30:27.134
[subtle chime]

30:27.308 --> 30:28.396
[CARON] Miss Wright

30:28.570 --> 30:30.964
you have an incoming call from

30:31.138 --> 30:34.141
Wright Station.
[cheerful ringtone]

30:36.317 --> 30:39.016
[ringtone continues]

[confirmation beep]
[electrical whirring]

30:41.148 --> 30:43.411
[hologram zaps to life]
[Ayla] Hey Dad!

30:43.585 --> 30:44.499
Nice sweater.

30:44.673 --> 30:45.500
[Ayla] Oh yeah?

30:45.674 --> 30:46.675
You like it?

30:46.850 --> 30:47.981
It's just some, uh...

30:48.155 --> 30:49.113
space garbage

30:49.287 --> 30:50.375
that floated in.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.333
Expensive space garbage.

30:52.507 --> 30:53.639
Like me.

30:53.813 --> 30:55.336
[Wright] [hearty laugh]

30:55.510 --> 30:57.164
And what has my
favorite space garbage

30:57.338 --> 30:58.339
been up to today?

30:58.513 --> 30:59.906
Ahhh, the usual.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.342
Pacing back and forth.

31:01.516 --> 31:02.866
Sitting.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.563
I argued with CARON for a bit.
[chuckle]

31:04.737 --> 31:06.957
[Wright] Ahhh, busy day. Well
you haven't sent me a new

31:07.131 --> 31:09.698
composition in a long time. Does
the music interest you anymore?

31:09.873 --> 31:11.135
Or the painting?

31:11.309 --> 31:12.788
-Eh.
-I can upload you a new module

31:12.963 --> 31:13.746
for whatever hobby you like.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.400
Yeah. I know you can.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.619
And he's kind of become
a pain in my ass.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.883
[Wright] What?
[watch beeping]

31:23.974 --> 31:24.844
Nevermind.

31:25.018 --> 31:26.411
I know it's for my own good.

31:26.585 --> 31:28.674
I totally understand.

31:28.848 --> 31:31.372
I'll let you know if I
need anything, okay?

31:31.546 --> 31:32.417
Promise?

31:32.591 --> 31:33.505
[Ayla] Promise.

31:33.679 --> 31:34.767
Okay.

31:34.941 --> 31:35.986
Hey guess what I brought.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.596
What?

31:37.770 --> 31:40.991
[childish game music]

31:41.165 --> 31:43.602
Oh, no way!!

31:43.776 --> 31:45.430
[8-bit game noises]

31:45.604 --> 31:46.822
Are you sure? Do you...

31:46.997 --> 31:48.172
have time

31:48.346 --> 31:50.348
to be completely destroyed
today?

31:50.522 --> 31:51.566
Please.

31:51.740 --> 31:52.611
Alright, come on.

31:52.785 --> 31:53.829
Give me a question.

31:54.004 --> 31:55.222
You ready?
-Yeah.

31:55.396 --> 31:57.355
What is the atomic mass of

31:57.529 --> 31:59.139
Triton?

31:59.313 --> 32:00.749
[Ayla] Come on! I thought you
were going to upload

32:00.924 --> 32:02.012
a harder deck this time.

32:02.186 --> 32:04.449
3.015501

32:04.623 --> 32:06.842
[sad 8-bit tone]
[Ayla] Seriously this is easy.

32:07.017 --> 32:08.235
[cheerful tone]
Are you ready?

32:08.409 --> 32:09.671
-Yeah.
-How many moons

32:09.845 --> 32:11.238
orbit the exoplanet of

32:11.412 --> 32:14.459
Z5Q13

32:14.633 --> 32:16.200
-That's the one with--
-[mocking] Uuhhhh--

32:16.374 --> 32:17.897
No hints!

32:19.725 --> 32:21.031
14.

32:21.205 --> 32:22.293
Nice try.

32:22.467 --> 32:23.294
It is.

32:23.468 --> 32:24.643
-No it's not.
-It is!

32:24.817 --> 32:26.384
It's not! It's 15!!

32:26.558 --> 32:27.994
Ha-HAA!

32:28.168 --> 32:29.430
[Wright] They don't count that
one as a moon.

32:29.604 --> 32:30.736
[Ayla] They do!

32:30.910 --> 32:32.477
-That's not a moon.
-It's a moon.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.305
[James] No, I'm talking about an
isolated docking bay

32:34.479 --> 32:35.262
connected to the pod

32:35.436 --> 32:36.611
where Daddy sends her gifts

32:36.785 --> 32:38.396
food, whatever.

32:38.570 --> 32:40.354
[Edgar] Why didn't I know about
this? I don't remember

32:40.528 --> 32:42.008
delivering anything to
a remote satellite.

32:42.182 --> 32:43.531
He's probably using a private

32:43.705 --> 32:45.229
courier from the main station.

32:45.403 --> 32:47.796
He plays everything with her
pretty close to the chest. Hell,

32:47.971 --> 32:50.538
for all I know I might be the
only person that has access to

32:50.712 --> 32:53.063
her remote monitoring systems.
-This is very interesting.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.499
[James] I know.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.153
[James] So I had a thought.

32:56.327 --> 32:57.676
Okay.
-And this is just me thinking

32:57.850 --> 32:59.286
out loud here.

32:59.460 --> 33:00.984
[Edgar] You usually do.

33:01.158 --> 33:03.508
What if we sent her a package?
-Like a scented candle?

33:03.682 --> 33:05.640
[James] Mmmm. I was thinking
more like...

33:05.814 --> 33:08.904
remote access software?

33:09.079 --> 33:10.689
What if we planted a rootkit?

33:10.863 --> 33:13.735
Okay, that's not bad.

33:13.909 --> 33:17.130
[Edgar] In that case I need you
to run an errand for us.

33:17.304 --> 33:18.653
What, you mean like

33:18.827 --> 33:19.872
leave the house?

33:20.046 --> 33:20.873
Yes.

33:21.047 --> 33:22.701
[toaster dinging]

33:22.875 --> 33:24.790
Fuck.

33:24.964 --> 33:26.487
Okay, what?

33:26.661 --> 33:28.489
[Edgar] I need you to run
over to a Sani-Trade.

33:28.663 --> 33:30.535
[incredulous laugh]

33:30.709 --> 33:32.711
Oh come on man that's not still
a thing. Wrightcorp

33:32.885 --> 33:36.019
scrapped all of its sanitation
purchasing proxies years ago.

33:36.193 --> 33:38.369
There's no unauthorized trade
between infected and

33:38.543 --> 33:40.762
uninfected citizens.
-The black market didn't

33:40.936 --> 33:43.330
disappear just because the
government said so. Trust me.

33:43.504 --> 33:45.289
It's still a thing.

33:45.463 --> 33:46.551
[defeated sigh]

33:46.725 --> 33:48.031
Alright, where am I goin?

33:48.205 --> 33:50.685
I'm sending you the address
right now.

33:50.859 --> 33:52.339
[fork slamming]

33:52.513 --> 33:53.819
[rooster crowing] [chorus of
creepy voices]

33:53.993 --> 33:55.342
[sleepy, creepy voice] Early
Grave!

33:55.516 --> 33:57.649
[creepy voice] They're trying to
cut me!

33:57.823 --> 33:59.694
[Nova] Y'all, I been smacked by
beat cops and beat by

33:59.868 --> 34:01.392
smackhounds.

34:01.566 --> 34:04.264
I been slapped by a hooker and
kicked by my own mama.

34:04.438 --> 34:06.440
I spent years gettin' stabbed
and shot at

34:06.614 --> 34:08.355
runnin' with all kinds of
shady characters.

34:08.529 --> 34:09.922
Nova Grave has been around the
block

34:10.096 --> 34:11.750
a few damn times.

34:11.924 --> 34:14.144
So believe me when I tell y'all
that I ain't never seen

34:14.318 --> 34:15.710
a single one of these

34:15.884 --> 34:18.278
anti-corporate
militant socialist

34:18.452 --> 34:20.324
'People's Army' yahoos
the mainstream corpo media

34:20.498 --> 34:21.934
is always goin' on about.

34:22.108 --> 34:24.415
They do not exist.

34:24.589 --> 34:25.981
The People's Army graffiti?

34:26.156 --> 34:27.418
Corporate scare tactics.

34:27.592 --> 34:28.810
People's Army bombings?

34:28.984 --> 34:30.725
Planned demolitions.

34:30.899 --> 34:34.207
The Eastern Autonomous Zone?!
Shit, y'all that's just a place

34:34.381 --> 34:36.514
for the corp-gov city police
to dump bodies

34:36.688 --> 34:38.646
without havin' to file any
paperwork.

34:38.820 --> 34:40.170
I hate to be a downer folks

34:40.344 --> 34:42.476
but the people have no army.

34:42.650 --> 34:45.000
There's no one comin'
to save us, folks.

34:45.175 --> 34:46.654
And on that cheery note

34:46.828 --> 34:48.656
let's get back to the music.

34:48.830 --> 34:50.267
[jazzy music]
[outgoing dial tone]

34:50.441 --> 34:52.138
[receiver clicks]
[Edgar] What?!

34:52.312 --> 34:54.488
[James] Why are you sending me
to a residential district?

34:54.662 --> 34:56.664
[Edgar] Most of the houses
are abandoned.

34:56.838 --> 34:59.276
It's the perfect place to run a
middleman service like this.

34:59.450 --> 35:03.062
There's a Sani-Trade vending
machine hidden in the backyard.

35:03.236 --> 35:06.109
Infected delivery personnel
load the machine from

35:06.283 --> 35:07.632
underground and
transactions are handled by

35:07.806 --> 35:09.373
Black Market Buddha.

35:09.547 --> 35:11.114
[James] "Black Market Buddha"?

35:11.288 --> 35:13.028
[Edgar] It's the moniker for
the vending A.I.

35:13.203 --> 35:14.856
[James] Sounds offensive.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.771
[Edgar] Seems like it would be

35:16.945 --> 35:19.557
[chuckling] but the machine's
programming is faulty and

35:19.731 --> 35:21.211
it insists.

35:21.385 --> 35:22.255
He's...

35:22.429 --> 35:25.258
manageably insane.

35:29.480 --> 35:32.135
[digital warble]
[jazzy music fades]

35:35.964 --> 35:37.662
[digital clicks]

35:37.836 --> 35:39.577
[wind chimes]

35:40.491 --> 35:42.710
[airy button sound]
[mechanisms activate within]

35:42.884 --> 35:46.061
[welcoming startup theme]

35:46.236 --> 35:48.934
[Buddha][British] Have you come
for spiritual enlightenment?

35:49.108 --> 35:51.458
[James] Uh, no.
No. Electronics.

35:51.632 --> 35:53.678
[Buddha][British] Well, you
never know what you might find

35:53.852 --> 35:56.071
when you're looking in
all the wrong places.

35:56.246 --> 35:58.073
This isn't a Wrightcorp-run

35:58.248 --> 35:59.074
Sanitrade proxy, is it? I--

35:59.249 --> 36:00.902
[violent mechanical failure]

36:01.076 --> 36:03.166
[Buddha][Demonic] Down with
Wrightcorp! Anarchy! Anarchy!!

36:03.340 --> 36:04.863
[glitchy transformation]

36:05.037 --> 36:06.865
[Buddha][British] [clears
throat] Pardon me. No no.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.563
This facility has been
salvaged and repurposed.

36:09.737 --> 36:11.217
And is now under the
management of a rather

36:11.391 --> 36:12.740
different organization.

36:12.914 --> 36:14.351
That's good. [nervous chuckle]

36:14.525 --> 36:16.831
[Buddha][Cockney] You cheeky
bastard.

36:17.005 --> 36:18.311
Okay. Um...

36:18.485 --> 36:19.921
You sell electronics
though don't you?

36:20.095 --> 36:22.663
[Buddha][Scottish] Of course we
sell electronics! Who's askin?!

36:22.837 --> 36:23.882
Oh! I'm sorry. Uh--

36:24.056 --> 36:25.710
Edgar! Edgar sent me.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.886
[Buddha][British] Oh yes Edgar!
One of our very best clients.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.670
Do send him our best.

36:29.844 --> 36:31.498
[polite chuckle] I will. Thanks.
Umm...

36:31.672 --> 36:33.718
So anyway I need three
variable-connect

36:33.892 --> 36:35.589
Spydir-class remote patch units.

36:35.763 --> 36:38.244
[Buddha][Cockney] And why do you
need three variable-connect

36:38.418 --> 36:40.290
Spydir-class remote patch units?

36:40.464 --> 36:42.161
Uh-- because Edgar needs them.

36:42.335 --> 36:44.598
[Buddha][Cockney] Nooo but why
do you need

36:44.772 --> 36:47.862
three variable-connect
Spydir-class remote patch units?

36:48.036 --> 36:50.213
For Edgar.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.174
I'm sorry I don't think I
understand the question.

36:55.348 --> 36:58.003
[Buddha][British] My dear boy,
the man who embraces the leash

36:58.177 --> 37:00.353
will one day find that he is
no more than a dog.

37:00.527 --> 37:02.181
Uh, well I have no idea what
that means.

37:02.355 --> 37:03.443
But thank you for the insight.

37:03.617 --> 37:05.924
[Buddha][Cockney] [guffaw]
Woof!!

37:06.098 --> 37:07.404
[labored sigh] Okay.

37:07.578 --> 37:09.232
Listen, Edgar needs the three
Spydir units.

37:09.406 --> 37:11.625
I can't have them mailed to my
current address

37:11.799 --> 37:13.627
and this is the only place that
I can buy black market tech

37:13.801 --> 37:15.716
without risking exposing myself
to ACHE

37:15.890 --> 37:17.979
and coughing up blood until I
die, so--

37:18.153 --> 37:20.634
[Buddha][Scottish] Ah, don't
worry! If you catch ACHE

37:20.808 --> 37:22.767
you'll only probably cough up
blood until you die!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.595
[hearty guffaw]

37:24.769 --> 37:28.860
[polite, tired guffaw] I'll
pass. So, um...

37:29.034 --> 37:30.949
Spy.dir units?

37:31.123 --> 37:33.430
[confirmation tune]
[object dispensing]

37:33.604 --> 37:35.823
[Buddha][British] Product
sanitized.

37:35.997 --> 37:38.043
[Buddha][Scottish] Well are ya
gonna grab the thing

37:38.217 --> 37:40.001
or ain't ya?
-Oh, uh. Yeah.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.265
[heavy drawer opening]

37:45.572 --> 37:47.182
[devices rattle]
[mechanical whirring]

37:47.357 --> 37:49.272
[object drops]

37:52.536 --> 37:53.406
Cute.

37:53.580 --> 37:54.581
Thank you.

37:54.755 --> 37:56.017
[shutdown tune]
Yum yum.

37:56.191 --> 37:58.106
[lamp clanging]
Ahh!

37:58.281 --> 37:59.630
[defeated sigh]

38:03.460 --> 38:06.027
[massive door slamming]

38:06.201 --> 38:07.420
[digital zapping]

38:12.164 --> 38:14.427
Ayla?!

38:17.387 --> 38:20.303
[birds and cicadas chirp]

38:34.578 --> 38:36.623
[digital whoosh]

38:36.797 --> 38:39.104
[another digital whoosh]

38:40.975 --> 38:44.457
Uh... okay.

38:44.631 --> 38:45.850
[Ayla] Ten...

38:46.024 --> 38:47.460
[James] Ten what?

38:47.634 --> 38:49.462
[Ayla] Nine...

38:49.636 --> 38:51.159
Eight...
-Is this some kind of game?

38:51.334 --> 38:52.813
Yes. Seven...

38:52.987 --> 38:54.815
What if I die or get erased or--
-You won't. Six...

38:54.989 --> 38:56.774
-How do you know?
-I programmed it that way.

38:56.948 --> 38:58.253
Five...

38:58.428 --> 38:59.777
[Ayla] Four...

38:59.951 --> 39:00.952
Okay well what am I supposed
to-- am I--

39:01.126 --> 39:03.520
[Ayla] Three...

39:03.694 --> 39:04.999
[gun charging]
AYLA: Two, one!!

39:05.173 --> 39:07.698
[laser gunshot]

39:10.657 --> 39:12.050
[digital zapping]
JAMES: [gasp]

39:12.224 --> 39:13.573
Hey!!

39:13.747 --> 39:15.488
Come on!!
[Ayla] [imitating bird] Cuh-caw!

39:15.662 --> 39:17.360
[distant laser shot]
[shot collision]

39:20.275 --> 39:22.234
[Ayla] Where would you want to
live?

39:22.408 --> 39:24.454
If you were a real boy?

39:24.628 --> 39:26.891
Mmm. Probably Wright Station.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.023
Oh god! Why?

39:29.197 --> 39:30.503
I don't know.

39:30.677 --> 39:32.679
It's safe.

39:32.853 --> 39:35.421
There's good air.

39:35.595 --> 39:38.381
Nobody's sick.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.516
It's really bad isn't it?

39:49.870 --> 39:51.698
I'm really lucky.

39:51.872 --> 39:53.874
Well, you're a good person,

39:54.048 --> 39:56.181
you deserve good things.
-It's easy to be good

39:56.355 --> 39:58.139
when nothing bad has ever
happened to you.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.011
[James] Well...

40:00.185 --> 40:02.143
In my experience there aren't an
overabundance of good people.

40:02.317 --> 40:03.580
So--
-Well I'm sure that

40:03.754 --> 40:05.277
optimism isn't exactly
a useful tool

40:05.451 --> 40:06.713
for a security system.

40:06.887 --> 40:08.367
Touché

40:08.541 --> 40:11.675
[Ayla] People change when
they're scared.

40:12.589 --> 40:14.199
I mean, I haven't lived down
there.

40:14.373 --> 40:16.723
All the history of the world
I've learned from

40:16.897 --> 40:18.333
lessons on a screen.

40:18.508 --> 40:21.728
which I'm sure has been colored
by some perspective.

40:21.902 --> 40:23.121
But I'd imagine

40:23.295 --> 40:24.731
that in addition to having a

40:24.905 --> 40:26.429
chronic, life-threatening
illness...

40:28.648 --> 40:29.910
it would be crushing

40:30.084 --> 40:32.565
to live in a world where you are
told

40:32.739 --> 40:34.611
where to go

40:34.785 --> 40:37.178
what job you can do, who you can
see, where

40:37.352 --> 40:40.138
everything that you do

40:40.312 --> 40:43.010
is restricted to a bunch of
zones based off a diagnosis

40:43.184 --> 40:45.796
that has labeled you for life.

40:48.668 --> 40:50.931
I've spent a lot of time up here

40:51.105 --> 40:53.020
by myself.

40:53.194 --> 40:54.805
And when I first got here

40:54.979 --> 40:59.113
I spent most of my time
doing things for myself.

40:59.287 --> 41:00.724
Painting.

41:00.898 --> 41:02.987
Composing. Playing video games.

41:03.161 --> 41:05.946
Dabbling in poetry.

41:06.120 --> 41:07.426
[Ayla] But after awhile

41:07.600 --> 41:08.993
doing all those things for
myself

41:09.167 --> 41:12.475
just made me feel way more
isolated.

41:13.911 --> 41:17.392
I stare down at that huge, wide
world

41:17.567 --> 41:21.484
this massive society that
doesn't even know I exist

41:23.964 --> 41:27.272
and I want to do something.

41:27.446 --> 41:29.840
Something good.

41:30.014 --> 41:33.626
I have the time. I have the
resources...

41:42.461 --> 41:45.072
I wish more people were like
you.

41:49.512 --> 41:51.426
[James] [sniff]

41:51.601 --> 41:54.299
Where would you wanna live?

41:57.215 --> 42:00.218

42:00.392 --> 42:03.308

43:05.544 --> 43:07.720
[James] Okay the Spy.dir I'm
sending should allow you remote

43:07.894 --> 43:10.593
access to Ayla's pod. You'll
have full control so, you know,

43:10.767 --> 43:12.507
you can gather whatever
information you want.

43:12.682 --> 43:14.684
[Edgar] Great. Bring the devices
pre-programmed to

43:14.858 --> 43:16.990
Black Market Buddha. And...

43:17.164 --> 43:18.949
on the way, I need you to do
another job for me.

43:19.123 --> 43:20.559
[digital window opening]

43:20.733 --> 43:22.343
[James] Whoa whoa whoa, why am I
doing this?

43:22.517 --> 43:24.519
[Edgar] You're the only asset
that we have with

43:24.694 --> 43:26.260
a non-exposure license.

43:26.434 --> 43:27.740
None of my people can even
enter the district

43:27.914 --> 43:29.133
much less the building.

43:29.307 --> 43:31.222
[James] Right, but... why?

43:31.396 --> 43:33.485
[Edgar] Because there's another
two million in it for you?

43:33.659 --> 43:34.965
[James] [labored sigh]

43:35.139 --> 43:36.401
[Edgar] What's going on with
you?

43:36.575 --> 43:38.316
Why are you suddenly asking
questions?

43:38.490 --> 43:41.754
-I thought you trusted me, man.
-I do trust you, James.

43:41.928 --> 43:43.495
[Edgar] I'm just trying to
protect you.

43:43.669 --> 43:44.975
[James] Yeah. Woof.

43:45.149 --> 43:46.280
[Edgar] Sorry what was that?

43:46.454 --> 43:47.760
[James] Nothing.

43:47.934 --> 43:49.240
[Edgar] Right.

43:49.414 --> 43:50.720
Do your thing, get in and take
the

43:50.894 --> 43:52.547
elevator to the lowest level.

43:52.722 --> 43:54.985
You'll need priority clearance
to access the testing bunker

43:55.159 --> 43:56.682
underneath the building.

43:56.856 --> 43:58.597
[James] Ok, and what are they
testing exactly?

43:58.771 --> 44:00.555
-Need-to-know.
-Of course.

44:00.730 --> 44:02.601
[Edgar] Our guy inside was able
to leave the package for you.

44:02.775 --> 44:05.256
It's located on one of the
weapons testing platforms.

44:05.430 --> 44:07.432
[James] Oh sure, that's
a safe place to leave it.

44:07.606 --> 44:08.999
[Edgar] Shouldn't be hard to
find.

44:09.173 --> 44:11.044
Grab it, and bring it to Black
Market Buddha.

44:11.218 --> 44:13.003

[Edgar] And don't drop it.

46:25.265 --> 46:26.963
Ooooh. Ya know honestly I kinda

46:27.137 --> 46:29.792
consider myself an independent

46:31.576 --> 46:33.796
Just... gimme the grav--
Gimme the gravity thing.

46:35.058 --> 46:37.147
You're not gonna shoot me.

46:37.321 --> 46:39.149
I will too shoot you!

46:39.323 --> 46:40.585
-No you won't.
-Yes I will.

46:40.759 --> 46:42.282
You don't even know
how to fight.

46:42.456 --> 46:44.110
[intense scoff] Look who's
talking!

46:44.284 --> 46:45.546
[Garnet] Listen...

46:45.720 --> 46:48.680
I can't let you leave here
with this.

here

overpowered you and took off.

46:53.337 --> 46:55.208
I'll tie you to a chair or

Look I'm sure your corporate
overlords will understand.

46:57.645 --> 46:59.343
No. They won't.

46:59.517 --> 47:01.345
I could lose everything.
My job, my pension

47:01.519 --> 47:02.346

47:02.520 --> 47:04.261
Oh?! You get insurance??

47:04.435 --> 47:06.916
[Garnet] They can come
after my family...

47:07.090 --> 47:08.178
What?

47:08.352 --> 47:10.136
[Garnet] It's not unheard of.

47:10.310 --> 47:12.312
There have been stories.

47:12.486 --> 47:14.097
Jesus, man.

47:14.271 --> 47:16.708
And these are the kind of people
you're gonna take a bullet for?

47:16.882 --> 47:18.362
Listen, it's not just them.

47:18.536 --> 47:19.537
It's this.

47:19.711 --> 47:20.668
This is not a toy.

47:20.843 --> 47:22.148
Yeah. I'm well aware.

47:22.322 --> 47:24.629
[Garnet] No you don't
seem very aware!

47:24.803 --> 47:27.197
If this thing is activated
under the wrong circumstances

47:27.371 --> 47:29.852
it could implode a city block!

47:31.288 --> 47:32.680
Really?

47:32.855 --> 47:34.682
[Garnet] Really. But it won't
hurt anyone

47:34.857 --> 47:36.989
if it stays in the right hands.

47:37.163 --> 47:38.425
[scoff] Yeah.

47:38.599 --> 47:41.385
And those hands would be
Wrightcorp's?

47:44.344 --> 47:46.129
Look...

47:46.303 --> 47:48.740
either way it's my job to fetch
that box

47:48.914 --> 47:50.220
and one way or another

47:50.394 --> 47:53.005
I'm leaving with it.

52:14.571 --> 52:17.313
[James] So what is that, anyway?

52:35.896 --> 52:38.334
[James] Why don't you just ask
your dad for a lab?

[Ayla] What?

52:45.254 --> 52:46.472
Between you and your dad.

52:46.646 --> 52:48.300
[Ayla] Nothing.

52:48.474 --> 52:52.130
He is the father of the century

52:52.304 --> 52:54.437
Except nobody knows that

exist unless he wants them to.

52:58.876 --> 53:01.879
And your mom?

53:02.053 --> 53:05.187
[Ayla] I could have been a test

Anything.

they killed you?

[Ayla] You died?

55:11.487 --> 55:12.792
Yeah.

55:12.966 --> 55:13.880
I mean, I guess.

55:14.054 --> 55:16.143
Sure.

55:25.979 --> 55:28.286
Ah-- I guess I'll have to get
back to you?

55:28.460 --> 55:30.114

you feel it too?!

57:18.831 --> 57:20.659
I'll allow it.

57:20.833 --> 57:23.314
[James] It's just that I thought
of an answer to your question

57:23.488 --> 57:25.664
from earlier. About... you
know, what it feels like

57:25.838 --> 57:26.578
to be deactivated.

57:26.752 --> 57:27.710
Oh, yeah!

57:27.884 --> 57:29.886
[James] Well...

57:30.060 --> 57:32.018
I don't think being unplugged
is the same as what you would

57:32.192 --> 57:34.194
experience. I mean I've been
rebooted and repurposed

57:34.368 --> 57:36.283
countless times. It sort of
loses its novelty

57:36.458 --> 57:38.329
after awhile.
-Oh, okay.

57:38.503 --> 57:41.158
[James] But there's a lot of
stuff rolling around in my head

57:41.332 --> 57:43.334
from previous jobs that I've
been put to

57:43.508 --> 57:45.684
and I do have one outstanding
memory from my time as a

57:45.858 --> 57:47.077
footage irregularity monitor

57:47.251 --> 57:48.687
for a hospital security system.

57:48.861 --> 57:50.907
Footage irregularity monitor?

57:51.081 --> 57:52.909
[James] Yeah...

57:53.083 --> 57:54.780
You know some A.I.s can be use
to sabotage or fake security

57:54.954 --> 57:57.304
footage so another A.I. has to
be put in place in order to--

57:57.479 --> 57:59.785
Got it. [chuckle]
-Right.

57:59.959 --> 58:01.961
[James] Anyway... I have a
memory.

58:02.135 --> 58:05.661
A... fragmented memory from
that job of a young man

58:05.835 --> 58:07.706
Twenty-something maybe?

58:07.880 --> 58:10.579
The dossier I got from his face
scan showed that he'd already

58:10.753 --> 58:13.625
watched his father and sister
die from ACHE complications in

58:13.799 --> 58:15.975
the same hospital that week.
-Jesus...

58:16.149 --> 58:18.978
[James] And I watched as he was
talking to his mother remotely.

58:19.152 --> 58:22.634
Just like the rest of his famiy
she had to be quarantined.

58:23.548 --> 58:25.507
So anyway he's talking to her
from a computer

58:25.681 --> 58:27.726
in the waiting room.

58:29.336 --> 58:32.296
And I remember this kid

58:32.470 --> 58:33.515
watching his mother

58:33.689 --> 58:36.300
the last member of his family

58:36.474 --> 58:38.911
die.

58:39.085 --> 58:40.173
[James] He told her

58:40.347 --> 58:41.958
I'm scared, Mom.

58:42.132 --> 58:43.916
I don't want you to go.

58:44.090 --> 58:45.744
And she said...

58:45.918 --> 58:50.270
[sigh] Her vocal cords sounded
like razor blades, but...

58:50.444 --> 58:53.230
She said, "I'm scared too
James."

58:54.448 --> 58:56.712
And I don't want to go either.

58:57.626 --> 59:00.019
But I know it's not me that's
going.

59:01.499 --> 59:04.197
All that I am is all that I've
done

59:04.371 --> 59:07.113
here on this planet.

59:07.287 --> 59:09.855
I always wanted to leave this
place better than I found it

59:10.029 --> 59:12.336
and when I leave
you behind...

59:12.510 --> 59:15.513
I leaveyou behind.

59:16.427 --> 59:19.256
And I can rest easy knowing
that.

59:21.867 --> 59:24.043
I hope she can.

59:28.134 --> 59:30.267
I love you, Darion.

59:34.532 --> 59:37.056
I love you, too.

you ever

talk to me like you're the one
in charge!

01:00:12.352 --> 01:00:13.876
What?!

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:16.095
If I tell you to do a job then
you'd better finish it.

01:00:16.269 --> 01:00:18.489
You put the box in the machine!
There is nothing to discuss!

01:00:18.663 --> 01:00:20.099
Who do you think you are?!

01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:22.624
I think I'm the guy who's doing
everything for you, so--

01:00:22.798 --> 01:00:25.714
[Edgar] You're a gifted guy, but
there's a hundred people

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:28.499
talented as you who would bend
over backward to do the work

01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:30.936
I handed you.
-Okay. Look--

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.069
[Edgar] And for what I'm
paying you, you prick...

01:00:33.243 --> 01:00:35.158
So I send you on an errand,
you do it!

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:37.639
An errand?! I could've been
thrown in prison with acheys and

01:00:37.813 --> 01:00:39.379
had my rights stripped away!

01:00:39.553 --> 01:00:41.643
[Edgar] Oh, cry me a river.
-So I can put weapons in the

01:00:41.817 --> 01:00:44.123
hands of terrorists?! Huh?!

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:54.394
You sound like shit.

01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:55.657
Thanks.

01:00:55.831 --> 01:00:56.832
[James] You okay?

01:00:57.006 --> 01:00:58.485
[Edgar] Yeah, I'll be fine. Look

01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:00.749
you'll get your money and then
some.

01:01:00.923 --> 01:01:02.446
Just hand over the gravity
condenser.

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:04.578
[Edgar] Besides, I have another
job for you.

01:01:04.753 --> 01:01:06.276
No I'm not doin' another job for
you.

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:08.974
[Edgar] Stop the hardball shit,
kid, you're not good at it.

01:01:09.148 --> 01:01:11.324
Besides, all you have to do is
not do something.

01:01:11.498 --> 01:01:13.675
What are you talking about?

01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:15.589
We're gonna ground the girl.

01:01:15.764 --> 01:01:18.549
Ground her?!
-Think about the payday

01:01:19.855 --> 01:01:22.248
when we ransom her.

01:01:22.422 --> 01:01:23.685
No. No.

01:01:23.859 --> 01:01:24.860
That was not part of the plan.

01:01:25.034 --> 01:01:26.600
Oh no?

01:01:26.775 --> 01:01:29.212
What was the plan, then?
[James] I don't know, you said

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:31.954
you wanted to steal from Wright!
Like a heist or something!

01:01:32.128 --> 01:01:34.304
[Edgar] And you practically
bagged her up and brought her

01:01:34.478 --> 01:01:36.567
to us.

01:01:36.741 --> 01:01:39.004
[Edgar] Once the Spy.dir arrives
at her pod

01:01:39.178 --> 01:01:42.355
we'll have remote access. We
can land her wherever we want.

01:01:42.529 --> 01:01:44.967
[James] No, that pod wasn't
designed for that, okay?

01:01:45.141 --> 01:01:47.143
[Edgar] No, but it was designed
to keep her safe

01:01:47.317 --> 01:01:48.361
and that's all we want.

01:01:48.535 --> 01:01:49.711
[Edgar] We'll rescue her

01:01:49.885 --> 01:01:51.930
safe and sound from the crash
site

01:01:52.104 --> 01:01:54.977
and you're not gonna tell her a
thing.

01:01:55.151 --> 01:01:56.761
for both your sakes.

01:01:56.935 --> 01:01:58.545
[James] No, you can't do this.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.417
[Edgar] Why?

01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:02.332
[James] Because she-- she's
working on a-- a, a thing.

01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:04.377
[Edgar] You'll have to be more
specific...

01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:06.379
She's building a fusion engine,
okay?!

01:02:06.553 --> 01:02:08.817
[James] She's working on a
prototype for--

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:11.384
She's trying to make things
better for people down here!!

01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:14.431
I'm trying to make things better
for people down here! We're

01:02:14.605 --> 01:02:15.954
trying to make things better!

01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:17.303
She's a Wright, James!

01:02:17.477 --> 01:02:19.610
Okay, look...

01:02:19.784 --> 01:02:21.525
I didn't get into this to hurt
people, okay?

01:02:21.699 --> 01:02:23.396
That's not me.

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:25.921
[Edgar] Well that's the burden
of privilege, Jimmy.

01:02:26.095 --> 01:02:27.792
[incoming ringtone]

01:02:27.966 --> 01:02:29.925

hands dirty.

[digital chime]

01:02:31.927 --> 01:02:33.798
Honey! I thought I told you not
to call me on this number

01:02:33.972 --> 01:02:35.757
unless it was an emergency!
-I've done it!

01:02:35.931 --> 01:02:37.976
-Done what?
-I got the simulation to

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.804
stabilize. Real world tech and
physics!

01:02:39.978 --> 01:02:41.197
What?

01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:43.808
I've built a working fusion
engine!

01:02:43.982 --> 01:02:45.157
I don't think so, darling.

01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:47.464
I sent you the tests!

01:02:49.945 --> 01:02:52.338
[glasses activating]

01:02:52.512 --> 01:02:55.254
[interactive noises]

01:02:58.388 --> 01:02:59.563
[Ayla] So?

01:02:59.737 --> 01:03:01.173
What do you think?

01:03:01.347 --> 01:03:02.566
[Wright] Darling, I--

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.134
This is incredible.

01:03:05.308 --> 01:03:07.049
You did this?

01:03:07.223 --> 01:03:09.225
I did.
[Wright] But how did you--

01:03:09.399 --> 01:03:12.054
[Ayla] Well I had access to all
the company's research up until

01:03:12.228 --> 01:03:14.056
we stopped working on the
project in '54.

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:15.666
So I just

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.234
transferred everything to my
Worldsim program.

01:03:18.408 --> 01:03:19.888
I didn't realize we were this
close

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.151
before I decided to pull the
project.

01:03:22.325 --> 01:03:25.807
[Ayla] What?

01:03:25.981 --> 01:03:27.721
We can't show anybody this

01:03:27.896 --> 01:03:30.202
but I am proud of you.
-Well obviously we can't share

01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:31.464
it with anybody yet, but--

01:03:31.638 --> 01:03:32.944
[Wright] I love you

01:03:33.118 --> 01:03:34.946
and you have to know I am so
proud of you.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.818
Look...

01:03:36.992 --> 01:03:39.255
I understand that it's too
important to go into production

01:03:39.429 --> 01:03:41.257
based off of some sims, but

01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:44.086
if we patent this process and we
prove that it works

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.175
on the ground in real life

01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:48.438
then we actually have a chance
of moving forward with--

01:03:48.612 --> 01:03:50.309
The problem is not your engine,
darling.

01:03:50.483 --> 01:03:52.442
The problem is people--

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.235
Your mother always thought of
our company as trying to win

01:04:03.409 --> 01:04:06.108
some victory for all of
creation.

01:04:07.413 --> 01:04:10.852
She loved people.

01:04:11.026 --> 01:04:14.159
Often I'm glad she passed when
she did.

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:17.859
[Wright] Before Earth became
what it is today.

01:04:18.033 --> 01:04:20.905
Before people showed their true
colors.

01:04:23.647 --> 01:04:25.301
[Wright] But it's beautiful

01:04:25.475 --> 01:04:28.565
seeing that same naive look
in your eyes.

01:04:30.654 --> 01:04:32.090
Dad

01:04:32.264 --> 01:04:34.527
people are just fighting to
live down there.

01:04:34.701 --> 01:04:36.703
You can't paint everybody with
the same brush!

01:04:36.878 --> 01:04:39.315
Honey, you just don't know.
-I do!

01:04:39.489 --> 01:04:41.970
Darion told me! He told me all
about the suffering.

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.146
About how hard it was at the--
-Wait, wait wait wait.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.277
Who's "Darion"?

01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:46.757
The A.I.

01:04:46.931 --> 01:04:48.498
[Wright] Your A.I. is CARON.

01:04:48.672 --> 01:04:51.240
[Ayla] No! The--

01:04:51.414 --> 01:04:53.764
The gift you sent me.

01:04:53.938 --> 01:04:56.767
The A.I. that you embedded
in my simulation?

01:04:56.941 --> 01:04:59.204
[Ayla] The security monitor!
-Honey, have you been

01:04:59.378 --> 01:05:01.337
talking to someone inside of
your game?

01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:03.730
It's a private network. No one
should be able to--

01:05:03.905 --> 01:05:06.733
No I know but he said that you--
-If you've been interacting with

01:05:06.908 --> 01:05:09.171
an outside user inside your
game, I have to disable your

01:05:09.345 --> 01:05:11.564
account. And I need to wipe the
entire network!

01:05:11.738 --> 01:05:13.088
No! Dad! You can't do that!

01:05:13.262 --> 01:05:14.959
I will lose everything!

01:05:15.133 --> 01:05:17.788
Well I can't lose you!

01:05:20.573 --> 01:05:21.923
I'll call you later.

Ayla, where are you?!

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:49.254
Come on, Ayla, we don't have
time for games right now!

01:05:49.428 --> 01:05:51.822
It's important!

01:05:51.996 --> 01:05:54.999

Ayla! You are not safe here!

01:05:57.959 --> 01:06:00.396
I certainly don't feel safe.
-There are people coming for

01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:02.311
you. You have to listen to me!

01:06:02.485 --> 01:06:04.574

thing you tell me to do.

My father deleted

[James] [over PA] Ayla?
[Ayla] [roaring] No!!

Go away! CARON, disable the PA
system! Turn it off!

[James] I turned off CARON Ayla.
-Go away!!

01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:47.720
[James] Ayla, your pod has been
compromised.

01:07:47.894 --> 01:07:49.374
I need you to help me
stop them.

-Stop who?
-There's people coming for you

They have remote access to you

01:08:04.389 --> 01:08:06.130
stop them if you help me.
-I hate you!

01:08:06.304 --> 01:08:08.089
I need you to look around

if we disable it, but if we

don't do something, they're
gonna--

I'm gonna kill you.

01:09:59.504 --> 01:10:00.810
[Edgar] And how are you
going to do that?

01:10:00.984 --> 01:10:02.420
You don't know where we are.

01:10:02.594 --> 01:10:04.074
You don't have a plan.

01:10:04.248 --> 01:10:05.641
You can't do anything by
yourself.

01:10:05.815 --> 01:10:06.816
I trusted you!

01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:08.209
[Edgar] I trustedyou.

01:10:08.383 --> 01:10:09.819
We trusted you.

01:10:14.606 --> 01:10:15.999
You saw all that?

01:10:16.173 --> 01:10:17.653
[Edgar] Shouldn't be that
surprised.

01:10:17.827 --> 01:10:20.177
You gave us full access.

01:10:20.351 --> 01:10:22.962
This was all your plan.

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:25.574
You're gonna hurt her aren't
you?

01:10:25.748 --> 01:10:27.880
[Edgar] Not if Wright
cooperates.

01:10:28.054 --> 01:10:30.318
While he's busy firing all his
private security and building

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:33.103
new firewalls, we'll land her
pod on Earth

01:10:33.277 --> 01:10:35.323
and arrange a trade.
-No, Edgar, I told you

01:10:35.497 --> 01:10:37.934
that pod was not designed
to reenter the atmosphere!

01:10:38.108 --> 01:10:40.371
[Edgar] She'll get to Earth
one way or another.

01:10:40.545 --> 01:10:42.417
This girl is more than a payday,
Edgar, okay?!

01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:44.506
She's important!

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.508
[Edgar] She's up in a pod in
fucking space playing a video

01:10:46.682 --> 01:10:48.640
game while billions of people
rot beneath her in an

01:10:48.814 --> 01:10:50.599
apocalyptic soup.

01:10:50.773 --> 01:10:53.079
You have nothing in common
with her, James.

01:10:53.254 --> 01:10:54.472
Why don't you join us down here

01:10:54.646 --> 01:10:56.518
in reality?

01:10:56.692 --> 01:10:58.259
Your future is here

01:10:58.433 --> 01:11:00.304
where millions of people
are starving and suffering

01:11:00.478 --> 01:11:02.611
and dying for change.

01:11:02.785 --> 01:11:04.526
You're not gonna choose your
own self-interest

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.136
over peoples' lives.

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:08.486
[James] I am not the one acting
own self-interest.

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:11.576
Helping Ayla would create real,
lasting change.

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:14.144
Her engine could basically
provide free energy for

01:11:14.318 --> 01:11:16.364
everyone. It would upend
Wrightcorp entirely!

01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:19.149
You could save every single one
of your employees from getting

01:11:19.323 --> 01:11:21.543
radiation sickness, but instead
you're gonna choose petty

01:11:21.717 --> 01:11:22.979
retaliation!

01:11:23.153 --> 01:11:24.502
This girl is not her father!!

01:11:24.676 --> 01:11:26.243
[Edgar] I don't care!

01:11:26.417 --> 01:11:28.550
Change doesn't come from above.

01:11:28.724 --> 01:11:32.205
And promises don't drain the
blood from your lungs.

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.164
The only path to justice is if
they realize

01:11:34.338 --> 01:11:37.341
they are exactly the same
as us.

01:11:38.908 --> 01:11:41.954
You're gonna give her ACHE,
aren't you?

01:11:42.128 --> 01:11:43.869
That's the endgame here?

01:11:44.043 --> 01:11:45.654
[Edgar] They need to see this
affect one of their own.

01:11:45.828 --> 01:11:47.482
No. Edgar.

01:11:47.656 --> 01:11:49.397
Wright is not gonna change
anything that he's doing. Not

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:51.224
for his daughter, not for
anyone.

01:11:51.399 --> 01:11:53.749
[Edgar] Then we will expose him
to the world as the monster

01:11:53.923 --> 01:11:55.968
that he really is.
-The world doesn't even know she

01:11:56.142 --> 01:11:58.971
exists. He's just going to deny
it publicly, and then he's going

01:11:59.145 --> 01:12:00.973
to come after you!
-Be done with this, James.

01:12:01.147 --> 01:12:02.714
One day you'll see

01:12:02.888 --> 01:12:04.977
that you were on the right
side of history.

01:12:05.151 --> 01:12:08.198
Edgar, you-- [call disconnects]

01:12:08.372 --> 01:12:09.678
[digital warble]
[loading noises]

01:12:09.852 --> 01:12:10.679
[digital clicks]

01:12:10.853 --> 01:12:11.984

01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:24.910

01:12:53.025 --> 01:12:54.287
[digital warble]

01:12:54.462 --> 01:12:56.289
Ayla?

01:12:56.464 --> 01:12:57.595
I trusted you.

01:12:57.769 --> 01:12:59.118
And you lied to me.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.424
[James] I know, I'm sorry--

01:13:00.598 --> 01:13:03.427
I don't want your apology. I--

01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:06.517
I want you to be real.

01:13:06.691 --> 01:13:08.693
[James] I am real, I--

01:13:08.867 --> 01:13:10.913
What do you mean?

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:15.570
You were just using me to get to
my father.

01:13:15.744 --> 01:13:16.788
I don't know what I was doing.

01:13:16.962 --> 01:13:18.703
I-- I never know what I'm doing.

01:13:18.877 --> 01:13:20.662
How can you 'not know'
what you're doing?!

01:13:20.836 --> 01:13:22.098
That is a terrible excuse.

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:23.839
[James] I know. I know.

01:13:24.013 --> 01:13:25.754
But I am real.

01:13:25.928 --> 01:13:27.364
And I want to fix things.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:37.635
My whole life's work...

01:13:37.809 --> 01:13:40.769
was for nothing.

01:13:40.943 --> 01:13:42.074
[James] No, Ayla, that's...

01:13:42.248 --> 01:13:43.075
no...

01:13:43.249 --> 01:13:45.687
no, I backed it all up.

01:13:45.861 --> 01:13:46.427
What?!

01:13:46.601 --> 01:13:47.950
[James] Yeah!

01:13:48.124 --> 01:13:50.605
All your stuff about the fusion
reactor is here!

01:13:50.779 --> 01:13:53.129
I made copies of all your
research, prototypes...

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:54.435
It's all gibberish to me but

01:13:54.609 --> 01:13:55.871
I've got it!

01:13:56.045 --> 01:13:58.961
Really?!
-And some of the paintings.

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:01.354
Most of the "blue period"...

01:14:01.529 --> 01:14:04.793
Why did you save my work?

01:14:04.967 --> 01:14:06.751
I was gonna sell it.

01:14:11.887 --> 01:14:12.714
What's your name?

01:14:12.888 --> 01:14:15.151
Your real name?

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.459
James.

01:14:18.633 --> 01:14:21.157
My, uh--
My name is James Walsh.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:23.289
You're too messed up

01:14:23.464 --> 01:14:24.334
not to be real.

01:14:24.508 --> 01:14:25.727
Right?

01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:27.598
"James Walsh"?
-Oh, you bet I am.

01:14:27.772 --> 01:14:30.079
[Ayla] [laughing]
-Look, I'm gonna fix this. Ok?

01:14:30.253 --> 01:14:33.038
First you need to go to your
dad, tell them that they have

01:14:33.212 --> 01:14:35.867
control of the installation.
They're gonna try and land your

01:14:36.041 --> 01:14:38.435
entire station and it will not
survive reentry. So someone

01:14:38.609 --> 01:14:40.219
needs to give you a lift
out of there.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.004
Okay.
What are you going to do?

01:14:42.178 --> 01:14:43.788
I'm gonna try and stop them.

01:14:43.962 --> 01:14:45.311
[Ayla] By yourself?!

01:14:45.486 --> 01:14:46.791
Yeah.

01:14:46.965 --> 01:14:48.793
That's stupid!

01:14:48.967 --> 01:14:50.795
Yeah.

01:14:50.969 --> 01:14:52.405
[James] Listen, Ayla we have to
stop them, and I don't know

01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:53.581
what else to do.
-Well then we're going to have

01:14:53.755 --> 01:14:56.497
to figure out something else.

01:14:56.671 --> 01:14:58.368
No. I'll take care of it. You
get to Wright Station and--

01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:00.283
No.

01:15:00.457 --> 01:15:02.851
My father decided to stop work
on the fusion engine years ago

01:15:03.025 --> 01:15:05.593
because he didn't think that
people were

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:07.551
worth it.

01:15:07.725 --> 01:15:09.901
And by locking that away,
he has profited off

01:15:10.075 --> 01:15:12.687
the needless suffering of
millions for years.

01:15:12.861 --> 01:15:15.211
He tried to erase everything
that I have ever done

01:15:15.385 --> 01:15:18.214
because he was worried
it might cost him his empire.

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:22.871
Choosing

01:15:23.045 --> 01:15:24.046
to believe in people

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.049
doesn't make me "naive".

01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:32.489
I'm coming down there.

01:15:33.969 --> 01:15:37.102
And you're going to come get me.

01:15:47.025 --> 01:15:49.898
[massive door opening]

01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:02.084
[Buddha][Cockney] Good to see
you again James!

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:03.912
Good to see you, too, Buddha.

01:16:04.086 --> 01:16:06.044
[Buddha][Cockney] The People's
Army already left with today's

01:16:06.218 --> 01:16:07.785
shipment.

01:16:07.959 --> 01:16:10.309
What did they take?
-Why, the weapons, radar devices

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:13.051
and portable jamming equipment,
of course!

01:16:13.225 --> 01:16:14.836
Of course.

01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:16.881
Listen, I need access to my safe
deposit.

01:16:17.055 --> 01:16:19.536
[Buddha][Scottish] Alright,
what's the name on the account?

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:22.191
-Darion.
-And the password?

01:16:22.365 --> 01:16:24.106
Uhhh...

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.586
[Buddha][Scottish] [laughing]
I'm just messing with ya.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.326
[chuckle]

01:16:29.067 --> 01:16:32.505
[heavy drawer opening]

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.378
[Buddha][Scottish] Now laddie,
if you're lookin' to sell that

01:16:35.552 --> 01:16:37.946
device I'll knock 15
percent off my commission.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.601
No thanks. I've got something
special in mind for this.

01:16:40.775 --> 01:16:43.038
[Buddha][Scottish] Mmm! Workin'
for ourselves now are we?

01:16:43.212 --> 01:16:44.735
Woof.

01:16:44.909 --> 01:16:46.476
What'dya got in stock?

01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:48.609
[Buddha][British] Well we have
an assortment of off-brand

01:16:48.783 --> 01:16:50.349
protein bars

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:52.395
which won't damage anything but
your digestive system.

01:16:52.569 --> 01:16:54.310
-I'll pass.
-A litter of freshly sanitized

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:56.138
newborn kittens.
-Mmm!

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:58.096
[Buddha][British] And a
kinetic-assist, rapid

01:16:58.270 --> 01:16:59.271
pulse rifle.

01:16:59.445 --> 01:17:01.186
That I'll take.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.972
[Buddha][Scottish] Okay, we're
sanitizing everything now.

01:17:05.147 --> 01:17:06.931
[Buddha][Demonic] Hey!

01:17:07.105 --> 01:17:09.064
Do you want me to put this on
the People's Army

01:17:09.238 --> 01:17:11.066
credit account?

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.110
Rock on.

01:17:12.284 --> 01:17:14.156
[Buddha][Demonic] Rock on!

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:15.853
[Buddha][British] Sanitizing
complete!

01:17:16.027 --> 01:17:16.985
[heavy item dispensing]

01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:19.770
[heavy drawer opening]

01:17:20.858 --> 01:17:22.599
[heavy drawer closing]

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:26.124
Oh, and Buddha?
[Buddha][British] Yes?

01:17:26.298 --> 01:17:27.430
I'm gonna need one other thing.

01:17:27.604 --> 01:17:28.518
[♪] I'm gonna need one other thing.

01:17:28.692 --> 01:17:29.780
[♪]

01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:35.743
[package ripping]

01:17:43.315 --> 01:17:45.187
[leather flourish]

01:17:47.711 --> 01:17:48.625
[labored sigh]

01:17:54.805 --> 01:17:56.894
[James] Can you hear me alright?
[Ayla] Yeah.

01:17:57.068 --> 01:17:59.854
[James] Okay. Now I need you to
look around for a little

01:18:00.028 --> 01:18:02.378
piece of black tech. It's got
wires sticking out of it like

01:18:02.552 --> 01:18:04.162
legs. It looks like an insect.

01:18:04.336 --> 01:18:05.947
Could it get into the hardware?

01:18:06.121 --> 01:18:08.210
[James] No it doesn't like
actually walk around or

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:10.516
anything. That would be pretty
cool, though.

01:18:10.691 --> 01:18:12.518
It probably got delivered
with a shipment.

01:18:12.693 --> 01:18:14.129
It works wirelessly, so

01:18:14.303 --> 01:18:15.826
it could probably do that
from anywhere.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.480
[Ayla] Okay. What are you gonna
do?

01:18:17.654 --> 01:18:19.221
I'm headed to the Eastern
Autonomous Zone.

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:20.657
Achey territory.

01:18:20.831 --> 01:18:22.441
Seems like the most likely place
to drop you.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:24.400
[Ayla] It's not with any of the
deliveries.

01:18:24.574 --> 01:18:26.271
Wait a minute!

01:18:30.014 --> 01:18:32.060
I found it!

01:18:33.365 --> 01:18:35.411
James, this has eight legs.

01:18:35.585 --> 01:18:36.804
[James] So?

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.588
So it's not an insect, it's an
arachnid.

01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:40.721
-What are you, twelve?
-What are you, dumb?

01:18:40.895 --> 01:18:42.374
[James][laughing] God I love
you.

01:18:42.548 --> 01:18:44.899
We don't have time for this
right now! What am I supposed

01:18:45.073 --> 01:18:47.466
to do with this thing?!
-Okay, on the top there should

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.468
be some numbered toggles. I need
you to see

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:51.383
what it's set to and read the
numbers back to me.

01:18:51.557 --> 01:18:53.385
3-4-3-4-4

01:18:53.559 --> 01:18:55.736
[James] Okay, just flip any one
of the switches

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:58.042
and then read it back to me.
[grunting] [metal clang]

01:18:58.216 --> 01:18:59.348
[Ayla] Ehhh...

01:18:59.522 --> 01:19:01.045
4-4-3-4-4.

01:19:01.219 --> 01:19:01.959
Okay, so...

01:19:02.133 --> 01:19:03.221
What did I do this for?

01:19:03.395 --> 01:19:05.093
[gravel crushing]

01:19:05.267 --> 01:19:07.051
Because now I should be able to
connect to the Spy.dir unit and

01:19:07.225 --> 01:19:08.879
see the list of all the vital
programs

01:19:09.053 --> 01:19:11.012
the People's Army has control
of.

01:19:11.186 --> 01:19:11.795
[startup chime]

01:19:11.969 --> 01:19:13.362
[typing]

01:19:13.536 --> 01:19:15.059
[failure chime]

01:19:15.233 --> 01:19:17.235
Ah, yeah looks like they've got
control of gravity

01:19:17.409 --> 01:19:18.759
life support, the whole nine
yards.

01:19:18.933 --> 01:19:20.586
[typing]

01:19:20.761 --> 01:19:22.632
And it definitely looks like
they're going to land you

01:19:22.806 --> 01:19:24.068
in the Eastern Autonomous Zone.

01:19:24.242 --> 01:19:25.678
What about the Liferaft?

01:19:25.853 --> 01:19:27.463
-Liferaft?
-My escape pod.

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:29.682
My dad had it installed in case
of an emergency to

01:19:29.857 --> 01:19:31.075
get me back to Wright Station.

01:19:31.249 --> 01:19:33.991
Is that the big thing in the
kitchen?

01:19:34.165 --> 01:19:36.298
Would you be able to use the
Spy.dir unit to reprogram the

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:37.821
Liferaft to get me to Earth?

01:19:37.995 --> 01:19:39.605
Theoretically.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.259
Yeah, I should be able to
program it to follow a beacon

01:19:41.433 --> 01:19:42.957
that I send from my laptop!

01:19:43.131 --> 01:19:45.089
[Ayla] Great! I can follow it to
your location.

01:19:45.263 --> 01:19:46.569
Well, veer off a little.

01:19:46.743 --> 01:19:47.657
[Ayla] Nah, I'll just land right
on you.

01:19:47.831 --> 01:19:48.440
Heh. Do you know how to fly it?

01:19:48.614 --> 01:19:50.312
Yes.

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:52.444
Do you know how to land it?

01:19:52.618 --> 01:19:54.011
Theoretically.

"Theoretically"?!

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:56.666
[Ayla] I 'll figure it out!

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.015
How much time do we have

01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:59.756
before the initial landing
sequence?

[warning claxon]
[CARON] Oh, um... excuse me

01:20:01.889 --> 01:20:05.153
Miss Wright, but it appears the
emergency landing sequence

01:20:05.327 --> 01:20:06.937
has been engaged!

01:20:07.111 --> 01:20:09.505
Nevermind.

[large equipment shifting]

01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:17.687

[James] Alright, Ayla, what's
going on up there?!

01:20:59.642 --> 01:21:01.731
[Ayla] L ooks like I am
good to go.

01:21:01.905 --> 01:21:02.993
Whenever you are.

01:21:03.167 --> 01:21:04.908
Alright I think I found a good
spot.

01:21:05.082 --> 01:21:07.824
[James] In a few minutes, I'll
transmit the beacon. It looks

01:21:07.998 --> 01:21:10.958
like they'll try to land you a
few miles away, so we should

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:14.178
be far enough--

Close the Liferaft and enable
manual override!

01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:25.668
[error chime]

01:21:25.842 --> 01:21:27.409
[CARON] I'm sorry, Miss Wright

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:30.020
But I am not authorized to
enable manual override.

01:21:30.194 --> 01:21:32.631
CARON, I don't need you to
authorize anything. That's why

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:35.373
it's called "manual override".
[James] We have a problem. Looks

01:21:35.547 --> 01:21:38.333
like they changed the landing
trajectory. It looks like they-

Would you like me to play it
now?

01:21:52.129 --> 01:21:52.913
No.

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.626
Yeah, no, it looks like
they've changed the LZ to

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.672
right here. Must be some kind of
mistake. I need to make sure

01:22:13.846 --> 01:22:16.240
I'm not transmitting my own--

01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:41.787
We will welcome you with open

01:22:57.107 --> 01:22:59.544
Miss Wright! Please return my

01:22:59.718 --> 01:23:02.025
I'm afraid that without it I
won't be able to continue

01:23:14.472 --> 01:23:16.648
What was that?
-Just reliving our first date.

01:23:16.822 --> 01:23:18.781
Are you still at the apartment,
sweetheart?!

01:23:18.955 --> 01:23:21.305
[Ayla] I'm running a little
behind. You know I just had to

01:23:21.479 --> 01:23:23.438
do my makeup.
- I'm sure you look fine darling

01:23:23.612 --> 01:23:25.353
Can we go?!
-Entering the atmosphere

01:23:25.527 --> 01:23:27.659
requires a suitable ensemble.
Now, I'm going to lose you as

I'm gonna be down there in just
a couple minutes.

And eventually, the bodies and

She want's to help!

01:30:23.945 --> 01:30:26.034
[James] Violence isn't gonna
solve this, Edgar.

01:30:26.208 --> 01:30:28.079
That's all they understand is
violence.

01:30:28.253 --> 01:30:30.647
[James] No, Edgar
I don't believe that, okay?

01:30:30.821 --> 01:30:32.780
I don't believe that.

01:30:32.954 --> 01:30:34.564
[James] We have to be better
than this.

01:30:34.738 --> 01:30:36.348
You and I have to be better than
this.

01:30:36.523 --> 01:30:38.525
No I don't.

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.527
I've tried.

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.964
I'm done.

01:30:44.269 --> 01:30:46.315
Please put the gun down, Edgar.

01:30:46.489 --> 01:30:49.187
[James] Please put the gun down.

01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:52.016
[resigned chuckle]

01:30:53.931 --> 01:30:56.020
[Edgar] Ah, James.

01:30:58.022 --> 01:30:59.546
I tried.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:00.764
[gunshot]

01:31:00.938 --> 01:31:02.984

01:31:13.516 --> 01:31:15.344
[Ayla] Put the gun down!
[James] Stay down, Edgar--

01:31:32.535 --> 01:31:34.319
I...

01:31:34.494 --> 01:31:36.757
I--
I told him to put it down, I--

01:31:47.724 --> 01:31:48.508
[James] Hey. Hey, hey hey.

01:31:48.682 --> 01:31:49.552
Look at me.

01:31:49.726 --> 01:31:51.728
Look at me. It's okay.

01:31:51.902 --> 01:31:54.165
It's okay. Okay, we're gonna get
you up. Come on. Come on.

01:31:54.339 --> 01:31:55.427
Okay? You got that?

01:31:55.602 --> 01:31:57.429
Alright. That's Earth gravity.

01:31:57.604 --> 01:31:58.605
K?

01:31:58.779 --> 01:32:00.781
Your mask...

01:32:00.955 --> 01:32:02.391
[grunts]

01:32:02.565 --> 01:32:04.480
Okay, that's mine.

01:32:06.003 --> 01:32:07.657
[Ayla] [gasp]
[James] Ah! Look at me!

01:32:07.831 --> 01:32:08.615
Keep your eyes on me.

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.007
Keep your eyes on me, okay?

01:32:10.181 --> 01:32:12.967
You're gonna have to wear this
now.

01:32:13.141 --> 01:32:14.534
K.

01:32:14.708 --> 01:32:16.013
It's good!

01:32:16.187 --> 01:32:17.667
You look good!
[Ayla] [relieved sigh]

01:32:17.841 --> 01:32:19.669
[James] K...

01:32:23.543 --> 01:32:24.805
[James] Okay.

01:32:24.979 --> 01:32:25.893
Alright.

01:32:26.067 --> 01:32:27.459
I'm gonna help you out, okay?

01:32:27.634 --> 01:32:28.809
Come here.

01:32:28.983 --> 01:32:30.462
There ya go.

01:32:30.637 --> 01:32:32.639
Okay.

01:32:34.423 --> 01:32:36.730
[Ayla] [heavy breath]

01:32:36.904 --> 01:32:39.515
[James] What's going on here,
your dad can't afford shoes? Ok.

01:32:39.689 --> 01:32:42.039
Look at me. Stay with me, okay?
Don't look anywhere else, just

01:32:42.213 --> 01:32:43.432
look at me.

01:32:43.606 --> 01:32:44.999
[grunt]

01:32:45.173 --> 01:32:48.916

01:32:53.529 --> 01:32:55.662
[anchor] Violent protests
extending outward from the

Eastern Autonomous Zone over
allegations that

01:32:57.794 --> 01:32:59.317
corporate peacekeepers

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:00.710
had a hand in the murder of

01:33:00.884 --> 01:33:02.582
Edgar Bane

01:33:02.756 --> 01:33:04.540
an apparent leader in the
underground movement.

[anchor 2] --claiming to
be the estranged daughter of

01:33:07.543 --> 01:33:09.763
William Wright has declared
herself president of an

01:33:09.937 --> 01:33:11.678
organization called the New
Wright Alliance.

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:13.984
She says she wants to work
with the People's Army

01:33:14.158 --> 01:33:16.552
which until recently was
thought to be an urban myth

01:33:16.726 --> 01:33:18.641
to develop a publicly-owned
energy company based on

01:33:18.815 --> 01:33:20.469
fusion tech

01:33:20.643 --> 01:33:22.514
that she says Wrightcorp has
been hiding for years.

01:33:22.689 --> 01:33:25.300
[host] And if you're asking me,
she's painting a target on her

01:33:25.474 --> 01:33:28.129
back. With the energy
market taking such a steep dive

01:33:28.303 --> 01:33:30.000
infected citizens losing their
jobs!

01:33:30.174 --> 01:33:32.524
If she's really got some
magic-bullet energy source

01:33:32.699 --> 01:33:34.178
to share with the world...

01:33:34.352 --> 01:33:36.267
Now's the time, sweetheart!

01:33:36.441 --> 01:33:38.922
[anchor 3] And William Wright

01:33:39.096 --> 01:33:40.968
leaked company documents

that NWA president Ayla Wright

01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:46.016
is indeed his biological
daughter. The

01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:48.628
documents paint a disturbing
picture of a father
