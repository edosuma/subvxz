00:02.800 --> 00:06.634
(low, indistinct
conversation in distance)

00:21.150 --> 00:23.118
(door opens)

00:23.150 --> 00:25.710
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Mr. Medina.

00:25.750 --> 00:28.310
The eve before trial--
always a nightmare.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.622
You've met Kalinda?

00:29.660 --> 00:31.548
No.

00:32.830 --> 00:34.650
I'm Kalinda.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.658
ALICIA: Hal Peterman
speaks highly of you.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.395
He says you
helped him

00:39.440 --> 00:40.759
on the Michigan River
killings.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.336
And our client
suggested we meet.

00:42.370 --> 00:43.667
Yes, I've met Mr. Bauer.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.768
I like him.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.607
I do, too.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.835
Um, it's just that we already
have a jury consultant,

00:48.880 --> 00:50.802
and actually,
we already have a jury.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.148
I know. I don't pick juries.
KAléﬁDA:

00:53.180 --> 00:54.579
Then, what do you do?

00:54.620 --> 00:56.417
I read a jury's
micro-expressions

00:56.450 --> 00:58.418
to make sure that you
are persuading them...

00:58.450 --> 00:59.587
Ol‘ not.

00:59.620 --> 01:00.848
Micro-expressions?

01:00.890 --> 01:03.256
Uh, fleeting emotional displays

01:03.290 --> 01:05.155
revealing a person's
true feelings.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.555
KALIN DA:
And how much

01:06.600 --> 01:08.795
do you charge for
this... service?

01:08.830 --> 01:10.559
$60,000 a week.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.637
Or $250,000
for the full trial.

01:15.370 --> 01:16.667
Can we try a test?

01:16.710 --> 01:17.768
Sure.

01:17.810 --> 01:19.732
_ What does this
mrcro-expressnon mean?

01:21.740 --> 01:23.173
It's prejudicial.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.575
So you think
the prosecution

01:24.610 --> 01:25.679
won't try
to admit it?

01:25.710 --> 01:26.472
I know they will.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.340
But the judge
will see your job

01:28.380 --> 01:29.517
is irrelevant
to the crIme.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.882
Just... people hate
what I do.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.354
Spam.
Search engine
optimization.

01:34.390 --> 01:35.687
DERRICK:
Don't worry.

01:35.720 --> 01:39.258
The prosecution will be too busy
shoring up motive.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.120
They need to show that
you killed your father

01:41.160 --> 01:42.593
to keep him from
changing his will.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.120
My dad was my best friend.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.797
I would never hurt him.

01:45.830 --> 01:47.491
Get a good
night's sleep.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.430
It's good to
have you back.

01:51.470 --> 01:52.778
Thanks.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.368
I heard a lot happened.

01:54.410 --> 01:55.809
(door opens)

01:55.840 --> 01:57.649
60 grand a week.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.716
Contract him for two.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.388
And stop by my
office afterwards.

02:02.420 --> 02:03.739
I have a quick thing
on Stanton.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.382
Sure.

02:05.420 --> 02:06.717
WILL:
Really?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.886
A jury whisperer?

02:07.920 --> 02:10.286
Hey, if the client
wants to pay.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.854
Use him as a tool.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.721
Do you have a second?

02:14.900 --> 02:17.368
You need to
talk to Diane.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.891
I think you already know
I did talk to Diane.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.363
I know you threatened
to bar her

02:22.410 --> 02:24.537
from her office,
with security guards.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.208
Diane is going
out on her own.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.639
She's poaching
clients, partners--

02:27.680 --> 02:29.204
What would you do?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.399
Calm her.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.247
We need to keep her
on the reservation

02:32.280 --> 02:34.419
for two more months.
Why?

02:36.920 --> 02:39.855
I'm bringing in an independent
expenditure only committee.

02:39.890 --> 02:40.959
A super PAC?
Yes.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.719
One of the biggest.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.888
$100 million of unlimited
corporate spending.

02:45.930 --> 02:48.558
But we need to stay whole
another two months.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.397
We can't scare them off
With CIVII war.

02:50.430 --> 02:51.863
And after two months?

02:51.900 --> 02:54.630
We push her out.

02:54.670 --> 02:57.434
So, calm the waters.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.802
Keep Diane from leaving.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.774
I'm leaving.

03:01.810 --> 03:02.845
You're leaving?

03:02.880 --> 03:04.848
Okay. Where are
you leaving?

03:04.880 --> 03:06.245
Lockhart/Gardner.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.508
Do you need references?

03:08.550 --> 03:09.585
(laughs)

03:11.250 --> 03:13.787
I made a mistake, Cary,
letting you go.

03:13.820 --> 03:14.980
I've watched you grow

03:15.020 --> 03:16.578
at the state‘s
attorney's office,

03:16.630 --> 03:19.849
and I have to admit...
I've been awestruck.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.993
I like the state's
attorney's office.

03:22.030 --> 03:23.895
I know you do.
It's a good boot camp.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.261
But at a certain point,

03:25.300 --> 03:26.892
you need to get back
in the game.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.828
You don't think
I'm in the game?

03:28.870 --> 03:31.839
I don't think you're being paid
as if you're in the game.

03:31.870 --> 03:33.872
I'm starting a new firm--

03:33.910 --> 03:36.378
with David Lee,
Julius Cain--

03:36.410 --> 03:38.970
and I want to offer you
a key seat at the table.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.715
How key?

03:41.750 --> 03:42.978
Senior associate.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.545
Two-year path
to equity partnership.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.982
Who else is going?

03:48.020 --> 03:49.829
Samuels...

03:49.860 --> 03:51.623
Hunter, Bachner,

03:51.660 --> 03:53.525
Mazin.
KaHnda?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.425
I don't know.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.792
She plays it
close to the vest,

03:57.830 --> 03:59.969
but, um...
she's unhappy.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.604
Alicia?

04:02.640 --> 04:05.461
I... I asked her.

04:05.510 --> 04:07.432
My guess is
she stays with Will.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.777
I'll consider it.

04:08.810 --> 04:09.947
Good.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.642
I need to know in a week.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.318
Is that doable?
Very.

04:16.490 --> 04:17.946
Good luck in court tomorrow.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.786
I don't know why we're having
this conversation.

04:23.830 --> 04:24.922
Really.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.518
Just the polling.
Nothing else.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.027
(man laughing)

04:28.060 --> 04:30.324
The candidate's here?
Yeah.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.535
Eli, come over here.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.961
Eli, meet Adam.
Adam, Eli.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.932
Ah. Eli Gold,

04:40.980 --> 04:43.301
"the terror
of Michigan Avenue."

04:43.350 --> 04:45.739
Uh, just dropping by
for a visit?

04:45.780 --> 04:47.042
A visit with gifts.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.014
(laughing)
Oh, God...

04:49.050 --> 04:50.586
ADAM:
What was her name?

04:50.620 --> 04:52.986
It was, uh,
Melissa...
PETER:
Melissa!

04:53.020 --> 04:54.681
Advance team in 2004.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.529
Ah, this girl
right out of NYU--

04:56.560 --> 04:58.824
she brought in chili and gave
everybody food poisoning.

04:58.860 --> 04:59.895
(Peter and Adam guffawing)

04:59.930 --> 05:01.420
ADAM:
I mean, people...

05:01.460 --> 05:03.724
people were puking
for days. Anyway...

05:03.770 --> 05:05.863
Adam's got some ideas
for fund-raising.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.629
Really?

05:07.670 --> 05:09.865
Yeah, well, I... I heard
you were struggling a bit.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.559
Momentarily.

05:11.610 --> 05:12.907
Yeah, but it's the impression.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.635
And you know
how impressions

05:14.680 --> 05:15.908
become facts
with big donors.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.771
Adam did some
good work for me

05:17.810 --> 05:19.573
on my first run,
and I just thought

05:19.620 --> 05:21.417
he could do
the same here.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.987
I mean, that is,
if it works for you two.

05:25.620 --> 05:29.579
I'm just here to help...
not get in your way.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.450
It's Republican money.

05:31.490 --> 05:32.696
You don't know that.

05:32.730 --> 05:33.992
I know that.

05:34.030 --> 05:35.918
They want you to play spoiler.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.928
They want to damage
the Democrats going into fall.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.896
He's not coming in
above you, Eli.

05:41.940 --> 05:44.636
That's not what
this is about.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.604
Yes, it is-- and I'm
telling you right now--

05:46.640 --> 05:49.473
I am looking you in the eye--
you are the boss.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.649
Adam Boras works for you.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.615
But we need cash,
right now, or it's over.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.049
And if there
are strings attached?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.638
We say,
"No, thank you."

05:57.690 --> 06:00.989
And we hold our heads high
when we lose.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.829
Make this happen.

06:09.430 --> 06:10.397
(sighs heavily)

06:10.430 --> 06:12.432
Oh, good.

06:12.470 --> 06:13.767
You're on time.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.994
(grunts)

06:15.040 --> 06:16.564
(chuckles)

06:16.610 --> 06:17.861
What are you doing,
playing dress-up?

06:17.910 --> 06:20.174
Um, we're a little bit behind
on the Stanton suit,

06:20.210 --> 06:22.747
so I'm going to need you
to help the associates, uh,

06:22.780 --> 06:24.668
run some background
checks today.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.638
Did you hear me?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.489
They're real?

06:30.520 --> 06:32.044
Yes. Reading glasses.

06:32.090 --> 06:33.079
Oh.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.486
Um... look,

06:35.520 --> 06:38.023
you tell Bond to call
me in an hour.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.425
(sighs)

06:39.460 --> 06:41.018
Kalinda, I don't think
you're getting this.

06:41.060 --> 06:43.028
I assigned you a task:

06:43.070 --> 06:44.890
help the associates
on Stanton.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.795
I need it done now.

06:49.170 --> 06:51.900
Look, we've had our fun
and games,

06:51.940 --> 06:53.601
but it's over.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.848
I've been made your supervisor.

06:59.250 --> 07:00.444
(chuckles)

07:00.480 --> 07:02.016
You know what?
That's good.

07:02.050 --> 07:03.642
That's good. Have a laugh.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.988
Have a...
have a big laugh, okay?

07:06.020 --> 07:08.488
And go outside,
and then compose yourself.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.853
And then come back in,
ready to work.

07:14.730 --> 07:15.992
Thank you.

07:16.030 --> 07:18.021
For what?

07:19.230 --> 07:21.164
CARY:
Your client didn't want

07:21.200 --> 07:23.134
to be written out of a will,
so he pushed

07:23.170 --> 07:25.559
his rich father out
of a 12th-floor window.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.100
Have you seen these photos?

07:27.140 --> 07:28.607
WILL (on speaker):
Yeah, and they look

07:28.640 --> 07:30.176
pretty prejudicial to me.

07:30.210 --> 07:31.848
My guess is
the jury never sees them.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.074
You now what they did
in Roman times

07:33.120 --> 07:34.178
to people who killed
their fathers?

07:34.220 --> 07:37.519
Put them in a sack with
a snake, a chicken and a dog,

07:37.550 --> 07:38.642
and threw them in a river.

07:38.690 --> 07:41.887
Are we really plea-bargaining
down from Roman times?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.956
What'll you give me,
just a chicken?

07:43.990 --> 07:46.083
B_auer confesses
to his father's murder,

07:46.130 --> 07:48.018
and we'll bump it down to...

07:48.060 --> 07:49.027
(quietly):
Twenty-five.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.163
25 years.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.259
Now, that's a good day's work

07:52.300 --> 07:55.064
for Gardner, Bond.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.206
Hey, hold on one second, Cary.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.969
Your Honor!

08:00.010 --> 08:01.875
No, His Honor Weldon.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.105
Ah, that's why

08:04.150 --> 08:06.072
we're plea-bargaining during
the middle of your game, huh?

08:06.110 --> 08:09.147
I'm sorry, Cary. Could you
hold on one more second?

08:09.180 --> 08:10.010
Your Honor,

08:10.050 --> 08:12.109
it's your day
to collect cell phones.

08:12.150 --> 08:15.017
Ah. Girlfriend?

08:15.060 --> 08:16.618
Yeah. Her place or mine.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.957
Real negotiation.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.252
I'll be right with you, honey.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.154
Think that chicken in the sack's

08:20.200 --> 08:22.691
looking pretty good
about now, Cicero.

08:22.730 --> 08:24.197
Let's talk manslaughter.
Two years.

08:24.230 --> 08:26.118
We can get a recusal.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.091
Yeah, that's a good idea.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.700
Judges love to be asked
to recuse themselves

08:29.740 --> 08:30.968
on the first day of trial.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.261
We'll take it to
the chief judge.

08:32.310 --> 08:34.198
Hold on. I think he's here, too.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.639
And don't get all outraged.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.170
The state's attorney plays poker

08:37.210 --> 08:38.973
with half the judges
in Cook County.

08:39.010 --> 08:42.741
And Ms. Pine, you play tennis
with Chief Adler, don't you?

08:42.790 --> 08:45.213
Look, Cary, I'll be playing
for the next two hours.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.582
Phone my cell,
or we're going to court.

08:48.790 --> 08:51.258
We can offer second-degree.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.029
No.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.994
A year ago,
this guy killed a man,

08:54.030 --> 08:55.122
and the jury will see that.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.128
And Judge Weldon?

08:57.170 --> 09:00.662
Will's playing basketball
with him, that's all.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.907
Unless he can play
with the whole jury,

09:02.940 --> 09:04.134
I say we trust the evidence.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.798
Okay.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.270
(groans)

09:10.310 --> 09:12.107
I'm sorry.

09:12.150 --> 09:13.674
You were saying something
about skills?

09:13.720 --> 09:14.948
(all laugh)

09:16.120 --> 09:18.088
What are you doing?
Nothing.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.315
At least look like
you're trying.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.979
What, you afraid
to D me up?

09:24.030 --> 09:26.794
Ball in.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.597
You're going to
guard me now, Will?

09:35.640 --> 09:36.800
I'll guard you.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.330
You'll try.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.604
(grunts)

09:41.640 --> 09:42.948
What the hell was that?

09:42.980 --> 09:44.299
What? You said
to guard you.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.601
I didn't say
mug me!

09:45.650 --> 09:47.845
You want to call the
foul, call the foul.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.310
Ball up.

09:54.820 --> 09:57.789
Hey, sorry about
that back there.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.286
I got a little
carried away.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.854
No second gear.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.322
We're good, right?

10:07.170 --> 10:09.161
(chuckles)
Just messing with you.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.701
Yeah, we're good.
We're good.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.002
You sure?

10:13.310 --> 10:15.801
Yes.
What, you want me not to be?

10:15.840 --> 10:18.206
No, no.
As long as we're cool.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.376
Let's go.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.083
No, no, I...
I think I'm a bit tired.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.883
I'm heading home.

10:29.090 --> 10:32.059
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

10:43.110 --> 10:45.203
Thank you.

10:49.110 --> 10:50.771
I'm sorry.

10:50.810 --> 10:52.243
Excuse me?

10:52.280 --> 10:54.009
Don't make this harder.

10:54.050 --> 10:56.177
No, I literally didn't
hear what you said.

10:56.220 --> 11:00.259
I'm sorry that I threatened
to bar you from work.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.384
I'm sorry
that I lost my cool.

11:08.430 --> 11:10.796
So what do we do?

11:12.070 --> 11:14.197
I don't want you to leave.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.334
I want to make things different,
so you don't leave.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.408
You'll stop seeing
other women?

11:20.440 --> 11:22.431
(laughing)

11:25.980 --> 11:27.242
So what do you want?

11:27.280 --> 11:30.283
I want transparency.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.447
I want us to _share
our client lists.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.316
Share, as in...?

11:36.360 --> 11:39.989
Meetings, calls...
everything.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.264
Now, that would worry me
if you were leaving,

11:44.300 --> 11:47.997
because that would mean you
have time to solicit my clients.

11:49.070 --> 11:51.300
So it's a good thing
I'm not leaving.

11:51.340 --> 11:52.978
ALICIA:
As you can see, Your Honor,

11:53.010 --> 11:55.035
they're highly
prejudicial.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.229
And highly accurate.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.269
Overruled.

11:57.310 --> 11:59.198
It's best evidence. What else?

11:59.250 --> 12:01.878
Sorry, Your Honor.
I was, uh... delayed.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.115
Let the record reflect
that Mr. Gardner

12:04.150 --> 12:05.447
has joined our
little party.

12:05.490 --> 12:06.855
Anything else, counselors?

12:08.420 --> 12:11.389
Your Honor, we believe
our client's profession

12:11.430 --> 12:13.398
is irrelevant
to this crime.

12:13.430 --> 12:15.523
And every reference
to it would be prejudicial.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.891
CARY:
We agree,

12:16.930 --> 12:18.227
and we will make
no such reference.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.158
Good. Agreement.
How refreshing.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.895
CARY: But we ask
for the inclusion

12:21.940 --> 12:24.067
of evidence
of the defendant's drinking.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.066
He's denied this.
CARY: Yes, and we
would argue

12:26.110 --> 12:27.998
this denial is why
the victim threatened

12:28.040 --> 12:29.530
to write your client
out of his will.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.969
We ask to include
photographic evidence

12:32.010 --> 12:33.409
of the defendant
with an alcoholic beverage.

12:33.450 --> 12:34.917
When was this?

12:34.950 --> 12:36.349
A World War II
reenactment,

12:36.380 --> 12:38.280
October 2009.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.015
We found this photograph
during a search

12:40.060 --> 12:41.459
of the defendant's
apartment.

12:43.060 --> 12:44.322
Objection, Your Honor.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.827
You're kidding me.
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.828
Is that not your client
holding a beer?

12:47.860 --> 12:50.169
Yes, and we would stipulate he
had the occasional beer, but...

12:50.200 --> 12:51.462
Well, we don't have
to stipulate.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.933
We have a photograph
proving it.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.267
Your Honor, our client
is a World War II buff.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.495
It's just his hobby.
But without context...

12:56.540 --> 12:58.565
Then we suggest
the defense give it context.

12:58.610 --> 13:00.498
Your Honor, this is
not about drinking.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.509
This is about playing
on a jury's bias.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.472
This is about seeing
our client as a Nazi.

13:05.510 --> 13:09.071
I think the jury is smart
enough to distinguish

13:09.120 --> 13:12.385
between a World War II buff
and a murderer. Overruled.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.553
Let's get this
started.

13:18.530 --> 13:20.395
MAN: There was no sign
of forced entry.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.421
There was blood
from the victim

13:22.460 --> 13:25.020
on the balcony, here.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.095
And the victim was discovered
12 stories below.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.493
CARY:
Why did you arrest Mr. Bauer?

13:28.540 --> 13:31.862
Forensic technicians
found DNA

13:31.910 --> 13:34.572
under the victim's ﬁngernails,
which matched

13:34.610 --> 13:36.430
Mr. Scott Bauer.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.038
Neighbors had also complained
of hearing an argument

13:38.080 --> 13:40.048
between Mr. Bauer
and his father.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.513
CARY: And then you searched
Mr. Bauer's home?

13:41.550 --> 13:43.040
Yes, sir.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.148
And what did you find?

13:46.120 --> 13:48.088
This photo shows Mr. Bauer
holding a beer.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.054
Is that correct?
Yes.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.557
In his right hand.

13:51.590 --> 13:54.058
CARY: And he claimed he
didn't drink-- is that correct?

13:54.100 --> 13:56.989
There are seven
universal emotions:

13:57.030 --> 13:59.089
disgust, anger, fear...

13:59.130 --> 14:00.438
Just the bottom line.

14:00.470 --> 14:01.459
Four jurors

14:01.500 --> 14:04.139
were moved
to brief micro-bursts

14:04.170 --> 14:05.637
of disgust.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.433
At the crime scene photos?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.244
No. No, the crime photos
created universal disgust.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.975
The photos of Mr. Bauer

14:12.010 --> 14:13.910
engendered feelings
of directed disgust

14:13.950 --> 14:16.578
at Mr. Bauer.

14:16.620 --> 14:19.885
Great. They think we have
Colonel Klink as a client.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.478
We still have
the robbery evidence.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.420
Kalinda, can you get
everything together

14:23.460 --> 14:25.951
on the robberies?

14:30.630 --> 14:33.167
No.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.668
Look, I don't want to have
to go over your head.

14:35.700 --> 14:38.339
Good, because there
is no over my head.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.667
You spent too much
on push polling,

14:39.710 --> 14:42.429
and now your ego won't
let you back down.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.640
I've brought in
the cash that--

14:43.680 --> 14:46.103
Which buys you
a place at the table.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.378
Welcome.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.445
The most I have to do
is listen to you.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.345
I have listened,
and I have found you wanting.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.381
(chuckles)

14:56.560 --> 14:58.323
(clears throat)

14:59.690 --> 15:03.023
Unless that's Buddha
and Jesus on speed dial,

15:03.070 --> 15:05.630
I don't think we have
much to talk about.

15:05.670 --> 15:06.967
Jackie, how are you?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.537
Yeah.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.106
Yeah. Hi. It's Adam.

15:11.140 --> 15:12.562
You know, it's funny.
I'm sitting right here

15:12.610 --> 15:14.271
with Eli Gold.

15:14.310 --> 15:16.039
I'm sorry-- do you
know Peter's mother?

15:16.080 --> 15:18.605
We became friends
during the '04 campaign.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.117
She's the one who
phoned me to help.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.015
Uh-huh? No.
No, no, no, no.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.210
We're playing nice.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.649
(laughing)

15:24.690 --> 15:28.057
You are such
a kidder.

15:28.090 --> 15:31.150
ALICIA: You said there were
Signs of a struggle, Detective?

15:31.190 --> 15:32.384
MAN:
I did, yes.

15:32.430 --> 15:35.058
ALICIA: And you had been in
the neighborhood a week earlier

15:35.100 --> 15:37.318
and found a similar scene,
hadn't you?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.622
Objection.
Irrelevant and immaterial.

15:39.670 --> 15:40.989
Overruled.
You may answer.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.065
Your Honor,
may we approach the bench?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.134
JUDGE WELDON:
You may.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.569
You'll have to excuse us.

15:45.610 --> 15:48.374
We're not being rude
intentionally.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.608
Your Honor, the defense
is trying to draw a connection

15:51.650 --> 15:53.242
between this murder
and three unsolved robberies

15:53.280 --> 15:55.145
in the neighborhood.
We would ask for a proffer

15:55.180 --> 15:58.638
Oh, come on.
before they continue
with this line of questioning.

15:58.690 --> 16:00.055
There was no sign
of forced entry.

16:00.090 --> 16:01.580
ALICIA: There was no sign
of forced entry

16:01.620 --> 16:02.382
in the other burglaries, either.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.581
Doors were chosen
Without peepholes

16:04.630 --> 16:05.585
so the victim
would come to the door.

16:05.630 --> 16:06.483
The police
cross-referenced

16:06.530 --> 16:08.589
the victims' belongings
with an inventory

16:08.630 --> 16:10.222
_ filed with his
insurance carrier.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.328
Nothing was missing.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.689
Then let the
prosecution argue that,

16:12.730 --> 16:15.198
and let the jury
decide, Your Honor.

16:16.670 --> 16:19.309
I'm siding with the
prosecution on this.

16:19.340 --> 16:20.477
Unless you can
present evidence

16:20.510 --> 16:22.239
to support a theory
of robbery,

16:22.280 --> 16:23.577
I'll sustain
the objection.

16:23.610 --> 16:25.771
What objection?
There was none.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.072
Objection.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.008
Sustained.

16:31.750 --> 16:36.084
Do you have a problem,
Mr. Gardner?

16:36.120 --> 16:39.089
(chuckles)
Should I have a problem?

16:39.130 --> 16:41.690
Well, that's up
to you, isn't it?

16:45.770 --> 16:47.761
Could've gone either way.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.439
No. He's deciding
against us.

16:50.470 --> 16:52.563
What do you want to do?

16:52.610 --> 16:54.077
(sighs)

16:55.540 --> 16:57.440
ALICIA:
What's going on?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.674
What do you mean?

16:58.710 --> 17:00.143
You.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.612
What's your address?

17:08.660 --> 17:10.252
My address?

17:10.290 --> 17:12.588
Your old address,
before you worked here.

17:12.630 --> 17:15.451
2266 Weyburn. Why?

17:15.500 --> 17:18.765
I took this from
Blake's car.

17:18.800 --> 17:23.260
And for some reason, it has
your old address in it.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.766
What?

17:24.810 --> 17:27.608
He also wrote down a name.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.528
Um, Marcie Raines?

17:29.580 --> 17:31.104
That was my neighbor.

17:31.150 --> 17:34.176
Someone he interviewed
over a month ago.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.318
What are you doing?

17:43.360 --> 17:44.725
Excuse me?

17:44.760 --> 17:46.387
What are you doing
investigating me?

17:46.430 --> 17:49.228
You talked
to my neighbor?
Look”.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.399
Who the hell told you
you could talk to my neighbor?

17:51.430 --> 17:52.727
Look, Alicia...

17:52.770 --> 17:53.862
Don't you dare try to calm me.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.289
It was just a simple
background check.

17:56.340 --> 17:57.500
By who?

17:57.540 --> 17:58.802
Who told you
to background-check?

17:59.840 --> 18:02.400
I unfortunately can't say.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.544
Don't you ever look
into my background again.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.823
ALICIA:
Do you have a minute?

18:24.870 --> 18:26.792
Sure.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.667
Oh, that's right.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.736
You wanted to talk when
things calmed down.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.738
During the
death row appeal,

18:33.780 --> 18:35.668
you said you wanted to
talk about something.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.575
Oh, no. I mean, yes.

18:37.610 --> 18:38.872
Um, at some point.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.741
But this is
something else.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.839
Someone told Blake to do
a background check on me.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.848
Some...

18:44.890 --> 18:46.517
What?!

18:46.550 --> 18:47.858
He investigated my
old neighborhood.

18:47.890 --> 18:49.289
He talked to my
old neighbors.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.685
He said it was a
background check.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.823
What's going on?
I have no idea.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.623
It's just...
No, you don't have to explain.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.355
I'll find out.
I didn't ask for it.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.719
Diane didn't ask for it.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.466
And Bond?

19:02.240 --> 19:03.707
I'll find out.

19:06.370 --> 19:08.531
That's not what I
wanted to talk about

19:08.580 --> 19:09.899
when I asked before.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.703
It...

19:11.750 --> 19:13.513
I know what it is.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.187
You...?

19:17.220 --> 19:19.279
How do you know?

19:19.320 --> 19:21.481
Diane told me.

19:24.930 --> 19:27.649
Are we possibly talking
about two different things?

19:29.830 --> 19:32.162
Diane asked you
to join her at her new firm.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.798
Yes.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.808
That's what it was.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.298
I wanted to tell you,
but she invoked confidentiality.

19:41.340 --> 19:43.808
I get it. Don't worry.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.374
I don't want to go with her.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.640
Good.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.671
I'm glad.

19:54.890 --> 19:56.881
Okay. I'm going now.

19:56.920 --> 20:01.425
Maybe another time,
things will slow down.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.325
JACKIE:
Yes, I phoned him.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.258
If you don't mind
me saying so,

20:05.300 --> 20:06.494
that was a mistake.

20:06.530 --> 20:08.669
Oh, I don't mind
you saying so.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.429
The money he brings
has strings attached.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.665
You see, Mr. Gold,

20:12.710 --> 20:15.838
I've just been so out of touch
with the campaign.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.419
I... I wanted to help,
so I phoned an old friend,

20:20.450 --> 20:24.238
someone who always
kept me in touch.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.815
Ijust...

20:26.850 --> 20:29.353
haven't wanted
to trouble you, ma'am.

20:29.390 --> 20:31.688
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm sure that's it.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.893
Adam doesn't mind
troubling me.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.360
Your Honor.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.867
You didn't play tonight.

20:40.900 --> 20:44.404
Nope. Gotta prepare
for trial tomorrow.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.931
Look, Judge...

20:46.970 --> 20:50.007
I feel like the other night,
you and I got into it and...

20:50.040 --> 20:51.871
It was just a game.
That's all.

20:51.910 --> 20:52.842
I've already
forgotten about it.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.916
Uh, me, too.

20:54.950 --> 20:58.010
Except, in court,
it feels like...

20:58.050 --> 21:00.280
you know.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.459
No. I don't know.

21:02.490 --> 21:04.526
Why don't you enlighten me?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.380
You're not going to make this
easy for me, are you?

21:06.430 --> 21:09.319
Look, if you're trying to accuse
me of something, counselor,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.624
why don't you just
come out and say it?

21:11.670 --> 21:13.695
Okay.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.038
You're mad because
I fouled you,

21:16.070 --> 21:17.867
and you're taxing me in
court because of it.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.865
You're letting
the SA's office

21:18.910 --> 21:21.572
put any damn thing they
want into evidence.

21:21.610 --> 21:23.999
Maybe the SA's office would
like to know that you're having

21:24.050 --> 21:25.938
ex parte discussions
with me, about the case,

21:25.980 --> 21:28.710
behind their back.
You're one to talk.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.910
Watch it, Will.

21:29.950 --> 21:30.882
No, you watch it.
You're the...

21:35.560 --> 21:36.913
You need to recuse yourself.

21:36.960 --> 21:37.688
(laughs)

21:37.730 --> 21:39.482
I'm asking you
to recuse yourself.

21:39.530 --> 21:40.497
No.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.498
Then, let me withdraw,

21:42.530 --> 21:44.566
because right now I'm doing
a disservice to my client.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.727
No. We have got a jury.

21:46.770 --> 21:48.897
I am not giving anyone grounds
for mistrial.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.067
You took the case.
You try it.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.601
It's called defense.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.631
You should learn to play some.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.655
MEDINA: That's the one
to keep your eye on.

22:11.690 --> 22:14.056
Right there
in the center.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.897
He's the leader.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.124
Now, he's not
the most handsome.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.764
He's not the richest.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.497
He's not the... he's not
the most knowledgeable.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.008
But he's
the pack leader.

22:25.040 --> 22:28.373
You see,
people are like dogs.

22:28.410 --> 22:32.141
The way to read them
is like dogs.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.569
It's a pack mentality.

22:35.650 --> 22:38.778
How much do you
make in a year?

22:38.820 --> 22:41.709
I don't know. Varies.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.909
But you work.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.882
People actually hire you.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.819
Yes. I have an 80%
prediction rate.

22:47.860 --> 22:50.567
Yeah. I looked into
your past cases.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.022
You're very selective.

22:52.070 --> 22:55.164
You seem to choose cases
that are easy to predict.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.168
People don't complain.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.009
People want to
believe in magic.

23:00.940 --> 23:02.999
There. There they go.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.099
The pack disperses.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.778
It readjusts.
It follows.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.776
Some stay behind.

23:09.820 --> 23:12.414
That's not magic, ma'am.

23:12.450 --> 23:14.987
People are not unique.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.557
They are as predictable
as the tides;

23:17.590 --> 23:19.751
as trainable as pets.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.191
WILL: Here's what I think
we should do.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.798
Judge Weldon is biased.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.138
I think we can get
his bias to work for us.

23:32.170 --> 23:35.207
I'm going to provoke him
by asking for a recusal.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.073
And I'm afraid I need you
to bear the brunt of his anger.

23:38.110 --> 23:39.907
The jury will react more
if they see him

23:39.950 --> 23:41.076
being biased against you.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.849
You're going for
jury nullification?

23:42.880 --> 23:44.586
Yes, or a strong appeal.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.815
We can't undo his bias,
but we can push it.

23:46.850 --> 23:49.512
Okay.
Whatever you need.

23:52.530 --> 23:54.054
What's going on?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.954
What's going on
with Blake?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.524
You mean my supervisor?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.492
What are you talking about?

23:59.530 --> 24:01.691
Blake has been made
my superwsor.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.889
No, he hasn't.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.101
Wait.

24:06.740 --> 24:09.004
Alicia says he's been
doing background checks

24:09.040 --> 24:10.132
on the associates.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.148
Yeah. Partners, too.

24:12.180 --> 24:15.672
But I'm sure it's
all innocent.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.245
Anyway, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.054
Wait. Kalinda, stop.

24:23.220 --> 24:25.256
What can I do?

24:25.290 --> 24:27.258
I need you here, working.

24:27.290 --> 24:29.758
$50,000 a year increase.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.593
That's...

24:33.640 --> 24:36.859
too much.

24:36.900 --> 24:40.131
You just paid 120 grand
for a medicine man,

24:40.170 --> 24:43.071
so don't talk to me
about too much.

24:45.950 --> 24:49.215
ELI: His name is Adam Boras.
Part of Peter's

24:49.250 --> 24:51.081
2004 campaign.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.042
He jokes a lot
with Peter.

24:53.090 --> 24:55.558
Talks fondly
about old times.

24:55.590 --> 24:56.784
No.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.981
What?

24:59.030 --> 25:01.248
This only works when you don't
try to manipulate me, Mr. Gold.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.256
You want to get rid of someone,
get rid of someone.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.029
Mrs. Florrick, I wanted
to show you something.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.697
Excuse me.

25:06.730 --> 25:07.799
This is from
one of my friends.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.159
You see the label
on the bottle?

25:09.200 --> 25:10.963
It's a non-alcoholic beer.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.137
That's great.
I'll tell Will.

25:13.170 --> 25:16.071
Thank you.
I'm just nervous.

25:16.110 --> 25:17.179
As you can imagine.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.542
Go ahead, say it.

25:22.580 --> 25:24.639
No. No, I wasn't going
to say anything.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.011
Nazis need to be
defended, too.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.148
Feel better getting that out?

25:32.060 --> 25:34.153
You're right-- this Boras
thing is my problem.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.226
It's just that I found out
he was phoned by Jackie.

25:37.260 --> 25:39.262
That sounds about right.

25:39.300 --> 25:41.188
I need to talk to Peter

25:41.240 --> 25:43.094
abo_ut Jackie's influence
in the campaign.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.835
Any thoughts on that?
No.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.861
Thanks, anyway.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.642
Eli...

25:52.880 --> 25:55.769
There's only one thing
Jackie loves in life.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.948
She won't listen to me,
and she won't listen to you.

25:58.990 --> 26:00.855
She'll only listen to Peter.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.949
That's how you handle Jackie.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.249
You've got a motion, counselor,
before I call the jury?

26:07.290 --> 26:09.099
Yes, I do.

26:09.130 --> 26:12.793
We ask you,
with all due deference,

26:12.830 --> 26:14.036
to recuse yourself.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.100
(chuckles)

26:18.140 --> 26:19.869
The motion is denied.

26:19.910 --> 26:23.277
Your Honor, you have been
using a private grudge

26:23.310 --> 26:25.107
to rule from bias.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.845
You've got a lot of nerve.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.745
You've left me
no other option.

26:29.820 --> 26:31.219
Please address me
as "Your Honor."

26:31.250 --> 26:32.683
Your Honor,

26:32.720 --> 26:34.779
I fouled you
in basketball.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.288
_ You can sit down
right now, counselor.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.151
Your bias is clear to all.

26:39.190 --> 26:41.329
I have never held a lawyer
in contempt before, Mr. Gardner,

26:41.360 --> 26:42.793
but I will break that streak

26:42.830 --> 26:44.593
if you don't sit
the hell down-- now.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.105
Call the jury.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.703
And that's when I saw
Mr. Bauer and his son--

26:58.750 --> 27:00.149
there-- arguing.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.216
PINE: And did you hear
what they were arguing over?

27:02.250 --> 27:03.888
Yes. I'm not a snoop.

27:03.920 --> 27:08.050
It's just, as the building
manager, I hear a lot of things.

27:08.090 --> 27:11.719
Mr. Bauer was a_
recovering alcoholic.

27:11.760 --> 27:16.254
He expressed his disappointment
that his son was still drinking.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.427
Then he threatened to
write him out of his will.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.767
PINE:
Thank you, Mr. Kuney.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.234
No further questions.

27:22.270 --> 27:24.261
ALICIA:
So, just a few questions, sir.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.265
You've been a manager
at the apartments

27:25.310 --> 27:26.265
for how long, Mr. Kuney?

27:26.310 --> 27:28.130
Oh, my goodness.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.343
I guess it's been...
six years.

27:31.380 --> 27:33.200
Where has the time gone?

27:33.250 --> 27:35.241
And you recently put new locks

27:35.280 --> 27:36.269
on your apartment
door, didn't you?

27:36.320 --> 27:37.309
Objection.
Relevance.

27:37.350 --> 27:39.079
Your Honor, it is relevant

27:39.120 --> 27:41.213
because it's about the recent
burglaries at the apartment.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.683
Counselor,
I've already ruled on that.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.948
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
No harm, no foul.

27:46.990 --> 27:48.423
Excuse me?

27:48.460 --> 27:50.257
I said, "No harm, no foul."

27:50.300 --> 27:51.927
It's a basketball
collquIalism.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.461
Yes, I know what it is.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.695
Do you have a problem?

27:58.310 --> 27:59.402
No, I don't,
Your Honor.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.408
My apologies.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.237
May I proceed?

28:03.280 --> 28:06.306
WELDON: If you have something
to say, make a motion.

28:06.350 --> 28:09.239
Don't sneak it
into the record.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.010
Of course, I wanted to work with
Ike, but he's got his minions.

28:12.050 --> 28:13.756
We're having the status meeting
in here today, Peter.

28:13.790 --> 28:16.088
Oh, okay. Hey, listen.
Adam has a great idea

28:16.120 --> 28:17.382
of how we can get
some revenue...
Hello.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.388
(chuckling)
Mother?

28:19.430 --> 28:21.853
(chuckles)
Mother.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.421
What's going on?

28:26.470 --> 28:29.030
Jackie just wanted
to come to the status meetings

28:29.070 --> 28:30.264
to keep up
on the campaign.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.267
And you said yes?

28:31.310 --> 28:32.299
I didn't say anything.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.433
I just told her when we
were having the meetings.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.038
All right, well,
tell her she can't.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.809
She doesn't
belong here.
No.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.171
I'd love to, Peter...
she won't listen to me.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.347
Okay. You'll find

28:43.380 --> 28:45.143
the polling results
on page five.

28:45.190 --> 28:48.159
Oh, is the type too small
for you, Mrs. Florrick?

28:48.190 --> 28:50.829
No. No, this is perfect.
Thank you.

28:50.860 --> 28:53.124
Everybody, please
welcome Jackie.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.958
She'll be joining us, when she
can, at our status meetings.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.468
(applause)

28:58.500 --> 29:00.832
_Come on.
Please, ignore me. Please.

29:04.270 --> 29:06.465
There's been a shift.

29:06.510 --> 29:09.331
There was a micro-burst
of sympathy for Mrs. Florrick.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.076
_ But here's _
the interesting thing.

29:12.110 --> 29:15.443
That sympathy has turned
into sympathy for your client.

29:15.480 --> 29:18.347
Good job. I thought he was going
to jump down your throat.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.483
It was your idea.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.489
Okay, so we keep up
the pressure.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.181
One thing I'd like
to point out--

29:25.230 --> 29:27.425
the pack leader on the jury,
juror number three,

29:27.460 --> 29:29.348
the, uh, psychiatrist--

29:29.400 --> 29:32.892
still showing micro-bursts
of contempt toward Mr. Bauer.

29:32.930 --> 29:36.161
So we got a biased judge
and a biased jury.

29:36.200 --> 29:39.363
So we need to have someone
for them to be biased against.

29:39.410 --> 29:42.868
Kalinda, any other
suspects?

29:44.510 --> 29:48.446
Actually, I need to
ask my supervisor.

29:53.290 --> 29:56.214
WILL: I need_ to talk
to you a minute.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.421
I have to catch a plane.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.951
Some last minute details
on the super PAC.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.922
We'll talk later?

30:02.960 --> 30:05.326
No. Now.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.229
Why is Blake
investigating us?

30:12.240 --> 30:14.037
"Us"?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.502
My lawyers.

30:15.540 --> 30:16.871
My equity partners.

30:16.910 --> 30:19.208
Because I needed
to know who I was joining.

30:19.250 --> 30:22.970
No. Blake was investigating
even after you joined.

30:24.950 --> 30:27.418
What's going on, partner?

30:32.260 --> 30:34.956
What's going on
is information retrieval.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.126
That's all.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.297
I need information--

30:37.330 --> 30:39.321
some of it relevant,
some of it not--

30:39.370 --> 30:41.235
and I only know
if something is relevant if...

30:41.270 --> 30:44.433
Stop slinging the
New Age speak.

30:47.140 --> 30:50.109
I will ask him_
to stop investigating.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.875
Good.

30:56.480 --> 31:01.258
And Kalinda is to be given
a salary bump above Blake's.

31:01.290 --> 31:04.088
He is not her
superwsor.

31:05.560 --> 31:07.551
No.

31:08.930 --> 31:12.525
Then we got a problem,
because this is the deal.

31:14.440 --> 31:18.331
Either we bump Kalinda's
salary above Blake's,

31:18.370 --> 31:22.875
or the waters
won't be calmed.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.654
This is feeling a bit
like Groundhog Day.

31:35.690 --> 31:37.351
You going to
apologize again?

31:37.390 --> 31:39.620
We've been played.

31:39.660 --> 31:41.924
We had the superior numbers.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.598
We had the votes.

31:43.630 --> 31:46.519
And Bond played us
against each other.

31:46.570 --> 31:49.038
You thought I was plotting
against you; I wasn't.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.628
That's why you're leaving.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.530
We had this
conversation already.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.070
We agreed I wasn't leaving.

31:56.110 --> 31:58.169
Yes, but we were both lying.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.446
I'm listening.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.050
I don't like being played.

32:08.090 --> 32:11.958
So I suggest we do
the same to Bond.
How?

32:11.990 --> 32:13.582
In two months time,

32:13.630 --> 32:16.121
he's bringing in
a super PAC as a client--

32:16.160 --> 32:17.650
$100 million.

32:19.670 --> 32:24.004
At that point, Bond intends
to vote you out.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.668
Then he'll have the superior
numbers, and he'll isolate me.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.508
I say we convince him I'm still
on board for that plan,

32:29.540 --> 32:30.632
and in the meantime...

32:30.680 --> 32:32.238
We move against him.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.648
Okay.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.648
Okay.

32:39.690 --> 32:42.659
Let's not bicker anymore.

32:42.690 --> 32:45.386
ALICIA: The problem is,
there's nobody else.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.523
There's no other way
to get the robbery in.

32:47.560 --> 32:48.652
And there's no suspects.

32:48.700 --> 32:49.997
There's no wife, no descendents.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.668
No one else cut out of the will.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.191
Well, maybe he did it.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.958
When did you stop being helpful?

33:04.580 --> 33:07.174
$50,000 a year bump.

33:07.210 --> 33:09.610
And as a thank-you
for your years

33:09.650 --> 33:12.517
of continued service,

33:12.550 --> 33:15.110
membership at the St. Andrews
Country Club.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.610
Just what I wanted.

33:17.660 --> 33:20.288
You'll fit right in.

33:23.560 --> 33:26.097
I've got your back, Kalinda.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.189
Just make sure you got mine.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.731
I always have...

33:30.770 --> 33:32.465
and I always will.

33:38.410 --> 33:40.446
Oh, um,

33:40.480 --> 33:42.516
tell Alicia to target
the manager.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.745
The manager? Kuney? Why?

33:44.790 --> 33:46.610
His religion.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.653
Like you said, we need to
give the jury someone else

33:49.690 --> 33:51.681
to be biased against.

33:57.100 --> 33:58.727
Oh, my goodness.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.136
(laughing):
Oh, you startled me.

34:01.170 --> 34:02.467
Eli said you were out.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.138
What are you doing here?

34:04.170 --> 34:06.104
I want to talk to you.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.630
Really? Why?

34:07.670 --> 34:09.069
(sighs)

34:09.110 --> 34:11.101
Mom, you know I love you.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.210
Aw. You're a good son.

34:14.250 --> 34:17.310
But I need you to stop coming
to the status meetings.

34:17.350 --> 34:19.784
Oh?

34:20.820 --> 34:23.414
I need to do this on my own.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.624
Oh, of course. I...

34:28.660 --> 34:30.628
I'm sorry.

34:30.660 --> 34:33.720
No, no, no, please
don't apologize.

34:33.770 --> 34:37.695
I just want you to
understand that... I...

34:37.740 --> 34:40.129
I need to do this on my own.

34:43.280 --> 34:46.408
Is it still all right
if I phone for updates?

34:46.450 --> 34:48.475
Only if it's all
right with Eli.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.818
Of course.

34:52.850 --> 34:54.659
Good.

34:54.690 --> 34:56.681
Thank you.

35:09.540 --> 35:10.791
I'm tempted,

35:10.840 --> 35:13.161
but I need assurances
about the partner track.

35:13.210 --> 35:15.303
I don't want to be_
summarily fired again.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.371
I, um...

35:21.550 --> 35:23.575
Things have changed, Cary.

35:26.620 --> 35:29.885
(groans, laughs)

35:29.920 --> 35:32.821
What... what's changed?
My agreeing to join you?

35:32.860 --> 35:36.296
No, it's just, um...
we're a bit more in flux.

35:36.330 --> 35:37.820
Oh, yes.

35:37.860 --> 35:39.760
Flux-- that's one
of those great words

35:39.800 --> 35:42.189
that covers a whole
boatload of sins.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.272
Come back to us.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.378
Cary, come back to us.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.708
We made a mistake.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.741
We need you.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.888
At Lockhart/Gardner?

35:58.920 --> 36:00.547
Yes.

36:00.590 --> 36:02.558
I don't think so.

36:02.590 --> 36:04.751
I'm having too much fun
where I am.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.519
You sure?

36:11.570 --> 36:13.788
What's Alicia's salary?

36:13.830 --> 36:15.798
I don't know exactly,

36:15.840 --> 36:17.592
but I'm sure you
can imagine.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.839
Double it,
and put me in above her,

36:23.880 --> 36:25.677
and then I'll come back.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.648
You've grown up.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.910
Oh, yeah, I'm a big boy.

36:30.950 --> 36:32.838
It's good to talk to you.

36:37.990 --> 36:39.753
Good morning.

36:39.790 --> 36:41.792
I hope everybody
had a good evening.

36:47.770 --> 36:51.331
Uh, counselor, are you, uh,
ready for cross?

36:51.370 --> 36:52.632
Yes, Your Honor.

36:52.670 --> 36:54.501
All laced up
and ready to go.

36:57.580 --> 36:59.241
ALICIA:
Mr. Kuney, you talked

36:59.280 --> 37:01.646
about discussing many things
with the victim.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.375
What were they?

37:03.420 --> 37:05.445
Uh, what did I discuss?

37:05.490 --> 37:06.411
I don't know.

37:06.450 --> 37:08.714
What do managers discuss
with their tenants?

37:08.760 --> 37:09.715
I don't know.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.250
Your religion?

37:11.290 --> 37:12.427
Objection, Your Honor.

37:12.460 --> 37:13.950
I'm just trying to establish

37:13.990 --> 37:15.696
Mr. Kuney's familiarity
with the victim.

37:15.730 --> 37:17.550
I'll allow it.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.591
ALICIA:
Did you argue

37:19.630 --> 37:21.393
about your religion
with Mr. Bauer?

37:21.440 --> 37:22.691
Well, I wouldn't say argue.

37:22.740 --> 37:26.039
We had, uh,
spirited discussions.

37:26.070 --> 37:27.401
About your Scientology?

37:27.440 --> 37:29.328
KUNEY:
Yes. He thought

37:29.380 --> 37:30.802
I was proselytizing.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.671
I thought I was
just discussing

37:32.710 --> 37:33.938
the closed-mindedness

37:33.980 --> 37:37.768
of some countries like
Germany and France

37:37.820 --> 37:40.983
who refuse to recognize
Scientology as a religion.

37:41.020 --> 37:43.784
And during these
spirited discussions,

37:43.820 --> 37:46.288
did you discuss Scientology's

37:46.330 --> 37:48.298
ambivalence toward psychology?

37:49.500 --> 37:50.819
JUDGE WELDON:
Sustained.

37:50.860 --> 37:52.725
ALICIA: When the two
of you argued--

37:52.770 --> 37:54.635
excuse me-- discussed--

37:54.670 --> 37:57.594
these issues, did you do it--

37:57.640 --> 38:00.734
according to your neighbors--
with raised voices?

38:00.770 --> 38:02.078
Objection, Your Honor.

38:02.110 --> 38:03.407
Sustained.

38:03.440 --> 38:04.702
You have keys

38:04.750 --> 38:06.638
to Mr. Bauer's apartment,
don't you, Mr. Kuney?

38:06.680 --> 38:08.341
Yes.

38:08.380 --> 38:11.611
And you are the only one
who claimed to see a fight

38:11.650 --> 38:13.811
between our client
and his father.

38:13.850 --> 38:15.351
CARY:
Objection.

38:15.390 --> 38:16.709
WELDON: Sustained.
That's enough, counselor.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.785
No further questions,
Your Honor.

38:30.800 --> 38:33.303
(laughing)

38:36.410 --> 38:37.536
How you doing?

38:37.580 --> 38:39.047
All right, hold on, Tom.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.672
Was-was there something
that you needed?

38:40.710 --> 38:42.712
Hey!

38:42.750 --> 38:44.718
What...?

38:44.750 --> 38:46.718
Are you nuts?!

38:46.750 --> 38:49.389
That's mine!

38:49.420 --> 38:50.717
Get out.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.125
You are making one big mistake.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.582
Will you escort
Mr. Boras out?

38:53.630 --> 38:54.824
Don't forget
your coat.

38:57.630 --> 39:00.428
(phone ringing)

39:00.470 --> 39:01.698
Hello.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.765
Oh, yes, Adam?

39:03.800 --> 39:05.836
Oh.

39:05.870 --> 39:07.007
Oh, that's awful.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.099
Oh, you better do it
if that's what...

39:09.140 --> 39:11.643
if that's what Eli wants.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.477
The third quarter has improved.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.717
Although I think
there still needs to be

39:15.750 --> 39:16.717
some belt-tightening.

39:16.750 --> 39:19.617
We still ha_ve_s_ome
overcharges in litigation.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.816
Hello, Diane.

39:23.860 --> 39:24.827
Derrick.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.851
(clears throat)

39:31.800 --> 39:33.529
It's good to
have you back.

39:33.570 --> 39:35.060
It's good to be back.

39:36.640 --> 39:39.803
Anyway, we were discussing
the third quarter results.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.832
Uh, they're not as dire
as anticipated, but, uh,

39:42.880 --> 39:44.802
we still have
some overcharges

39:44.850 --> 39:46.841
in litigation. Um,

39:46.880 --> 39:48.177
I think this will be
the focus of what

39:48.210 --> 39:49.609
we're trying to get
accomplished next year.

39:53.020 --> 39:55.181
You seem happy.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.882
Yeah, I guess I am.

39:57.920 --> 39:59.922
Made peace
with yourself?

40:00.960 --> 40:02.848
Jury's in.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.765
You're kidding.
They just went out.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.563
Yeah, 20 minutes.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.919
Should be interesting.

40:24.650 --> 40:26.049
It's not guilty.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.045
Are you sure?

40:27.090 --> 40:31.049
Micro-bursts of calm
for Mr. Bauer.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.991
Good job.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.831
(clears throat)

40:57.620 --> 41:00.248
Members of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?

41:00.290 --> 41:01.689
We have, Your Honor.

41:02.720 --> 41:05.052
On the charge of
first degree murder,

41:05.090 --> 41:06.978
we find the
defendant guilty.

41:07.030 --> 41:08.827
You said...
Don't say a thing.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.122
We'll appeal.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.492
JUDGE WELDON:
Would the, uh, defense

41:12.530 --> 41:14.020
like to poll the jury?

41:14.070 --> 41:16.698
WILL: Yes, we would,
Your Honor.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.733
(sighs)

41:47.200 --> 41:49.259
Sir?

41:49.300 --> 41:50.767
Excuse me.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.903
I was with the defense.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.703
Yes, I recognize you.

41:53.740 --> 41:55.935
You don't have to answer
any of my questions,

41:55.980 --> 41:58.175
but it helps us learn
for the future.

41:58.210 --> 42:00.940
No, I'll answer your questions.

42:00.980 --> 42:03.016
It was just such
a quick verdict.

42:03.050 --> 42:07.009
Yes, there were, uh,
no disagreements.

42:07.050 --> 42:09.018
I see.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.880
And what decided it for you?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.729
"What" did?

42:12.760 --> 42:14.057
Yes. I mean, obviously,

42:14.090 --> 42:16.558
you didn't take the manager's
testimony seriously.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.966
And the judge--
did you believe he was biased?

42:19.000 --> 42:20.262
Oh, sure.

42:20.300 --> 42:22.097
You did. But that didn't
enter into your decision?

42:22.140 --> 42:23.789
No.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.001
Why not?

42:26.040 --> 42:27.268
I don't know.

42:27.310 --> 42:29.107
It didn't seem to matter.

42:29.140 --> 42:31.005
Then what did matter?

42:32.980 --> 42:34.971
He did it.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.938
I hope that helps.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.946
Have a good evening.

42:40.990 --> 42:44.949
