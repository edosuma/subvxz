26:09.568 --> 26:11.221
Welcome to my world.

26:14.834 --> 26:17.334
I have plenty. Do
you want to borrow?

26:17.358 --> 26:19.055
- Are you sure?
- Mhm.

26:26.323 --> 26:31.653
Marta, she lives next door.

26:31.677 --> 26:34.593
I just love how cute
your uniforms are.

26:42.949 --> 26:46.450
Do you wear them for
your job interviews too?

26:46.474 --> 26:49.105
- My jobs.
- You already have another job?

26:49.129 --> 26:50.585
All care service.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.283
When one home is done,
one job is done,

26:53.307 --> 26:55.807
they send us to another
home with another family.

26:55.831 --> 26:59.985
- Wow, that's a good job.
- I always have work.

27:00.009 --> 27:02.316
- Wow!
- Here, look she's very...

27:12.892 --> 27:14.850
- Nice to meet you.
- Bye.

27:16.809 --> 27:19.309
Are the people you
work for kind to you?

27:19.333 --> 27:21.398
Nah, not always.

27:21.422 --> 27:23.685
But those are the one I
feel more sorry for.

27:25.992 --> 27:31.277
Esmeralda, do you wanna
unpack my luggage for me?

27:31.301 --> 27:34.783
Ay, I forgot!

27:37.264 --> 27:39.483
[humming]

27:40.789 --> 27:42.854
What is this?

27:42.878 --> 27:45.576
I'm bringing this to
celebrate your new job.

27:47.622 --> 27:50.340
- Yes, what are we drinking?
- Mezcal.

27:50.364 --> 27:52.496
It's perfect for your first day.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.433
So when are you guys
gonna play here?

27:56.457 --> 27:58.740
Soon as I can get Brian
to listen to us.

27:58.764 --> 28:02.787
I know someone who thinks she
could put in a good word for you.

28:02.811 --> 28:04.876
When are you gonna
stop torturing her?

28:04.900 --> 28:08.314
When Ms. Dolores stops thinking
she's Brian's girlfriend.

28:08.338 --> 28:10.621
Can't you just tell her that
Brian is not interested?

28:10.645 --> 28:13.580
Oh, you know it and I know it.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.259
But it's way more fun this way.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.358
[music]

28:30.926 --> 28:34.776
- It's the last one.
- Oh, you are killing me, Massy.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.735
I'm sorry, Ben.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.389
What was going on in the
kitchen last night?

28:39.413 --> 28:41.783
The dishwasher.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.698
You haven't seen her yet?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.135
No, should I?

28:46.159 --> 28:48.683
Oh, you kick yourself
if you don't.

28:51.381 --> 28:54.578
I pass. Dolores says she's
gonna fire her tonight anyway.

28:54.602 --> 28:57.997
Huh, I can't wait to see who
will be most surprised then.

28:58.998 --> 29:00.042
What are you up to?

29:01.652 --> 29:04.438
You should be on
your knees, brother.

29:06.657 --> 29:09.225
You should be begging and
pleading, I'm telling you.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.338
[indistinct]

29:15.362 --> 29:17.470
Luiza, thanks for coming.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.429
We were gonna call you this
morning, but I thought we should

29:19.453 --> 29:20.865
tell you this in person.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.301
I'm sorry to tell you that

29:22.325 --> 29:23.849
we gonna have to let you go.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.523
Because we're promoting
you to waitress.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.873
- What, since when?
- Since one of your waiters

29:28.897 --> 29:31.833
called in sick, and we don't
have time to find a replacement.

29:31.857 --> 29:34.183
What, she can't be a waitress.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.817
She doesn't even have
the right uniform.

29:37.645 --> 29:38.777
Thanks.

29:43.651 --> 29:45.803
And she is an eyeballer.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.850
Welcome to Sundown Saloon, gentlemen.
My name is Georgia.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.677
Can I start you off with
something to drink?

29:50.701 --> 29:51.722
Well, hi there, Georgia.

29:51.746 --> 29:52.854
What I like to know

29:52.878 --> 29:54.551
is who is your friend there?

29:54.575 --> 29:57.119
That's Luiza. She's
trailing today.

29:57.143 --> 29:59.382
Luiza, trailing?

29:59.406 --> 30:02.602
- Hell, no.
- She's trailing?

30:02.626 --> 30:04.474
- Come over here.
- Yeah!

30:04.498 --> 30:06.084
Yeah. Luiza.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.694
Front and center.

30:07.718 --> 30:10.697
Luiza! Luiza! Luiza!

30:10.721 --> 30:15.093
OK, guys. Shall I be offended?
Who, me?

30:15.117 --> 30:17.269
Excuse me, you're drooling.

30:17.293 --> 30:18.662
After all I'm only your waitress

30:18.686 --> 30:21.012
and she's obviously
your destiny.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.256
Or your next ex.

30:24.953 --> 30:28.324
It's cool, it's cool, I'm not proud.
Let's compromise.

30:28.348 --> 30:32.023
I take your drink orders,
she delivers them.

30:32.047 --> 30:35.026
- Please.
- Deal.

30:35.050 --> 30:39.272
Luiza! Luiza! Luiza!

30:43.015 --> 30:45.210
He likes it when you
call the drinks out.

30:45.234 --> 30:48.934
- Call them out?
- You know, tell you what they are.

31:08.605 --> 31:11.521
- Hi!
- Thanks, Ben.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.439
How, how are you?

31:17.484 --> 31:18.702
I'm fine.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.464
Great!

31:21.488 --> 31:24.206
- Hi, you got an order there?
- Yeah, I do.

31:24.230 --> 31:27.252
So, we need, I need a Corona,

31:27.276 --> 31:31.498
a Pussy Charger, Doggy Style on
the Beach and Over the Rainbow.

31:33.456 --> 31:34.893
These guys yanking your chain?

31:36.764 --> 31:38.644
- They're messing with you?
- I'm sure they are.

31:39.985 --> 31:43.094
Well, you tell that guy that
Rainbow shivers are for sissies.

31:43.118 --> 31:47.794
Okay, you know, you can use some
Chambord and a bit of cream instead.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.319
These guys would never
notice the difference.

31:50.343 --> 31:51.798
What goes on top?

31:51.822 --> 31:53.650
Strawberry and sliced peach.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.629
How do you know all this?

31:56.653 --> 31:58.980
Oh, I know many things.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.851
Alright then.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.505
One Over the Rainbow
coming right up.

32:02.529 --> 32:04.986
- OK.
- For you, though.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.185
Not for him.

32:07.926 --> 32:08.927
Okay.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.887
[clearing her throat]

32:21.069 --> 32:22.244
[piano music]

32:23.550 --> 32:25.552
[clearing her throat]

32:28.468 --> 32:29.773
[coughing]

32:39.392 --> 32:41.481
[catching her breath]

32:43.874 --> 32:45.659
That is the last one.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.687
Luiza, you're suppose
to be trailing.

32:54.711 --> 32:57.168
I'm sorry, I know, but Georgia
thought it would be a good idea

32:57.192 --> 32:58.474
if I brought them the drinks.

32:58.498 --> 33:00.606
- Make them quiet.
- It better.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.719
This is a family restaurant,
not a frat house.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.797
There you are. Here you go.

33:17.821 --> 33:21.062
- What is this?
- It's yours, you deserve it.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.151
Biggest tip I ever
got in my life.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.979
Do you know who those guys were?

33:25.003 --> 33:27.938
Let's just say they weren't
from the neighborhood.

33:27.962 --> 33:30.288
- This was on the bar for you.
- For me?

33:30.312 --> 33:32.290
It's got your name on it.

33:32.314 --> 33:33.750
My name on it?

34:11.484 --> 34:12.484
[difficulty in breathing]

35:04.493 --> 35:06.452
[asthmatic breathing]

35:08.497 --> 35:09.933
Esmeralda!

35:11.457 --> 35:12.545
Esmeralda!

35:14.938 --> 35:19.397
- Look, it's all good.
- No, no, no.

35:19.421 --> 35:20.683
No doctors, please.

35:26.863 --> 35:27.951
Okay.

35:29.344 --> 35:30.867
[asthmatic breathing]

35:39.789 --> 35:42.420
[crowd cheering]

35:42.444 --> 35:46.100
[indistinct]

35:47.014 --> 35:49.147
I appreciate that,
I appreciate that.

35:50.322 --> 35:51.714
Thank you. Excuse me.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.129
Hi, you...

35:55.153 --> 35:56.434
- You made it.
- I did.

35:56.458 --> 35:57.566
It was so crowded

35:57.590 --> 35:58.567
I stood in the back.

35:58.591 --> 36:00.177
You were wonderful.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.178
Thank you.

36:01.202 --> 36:03.572
I'm glad you thought so.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.313
Do you want to get
out of here or...?

36:05.337 --> 36:06.836
Yeah, let's do it.

36:06.860 --> 36:07.904
- Great!
- Let's go.

36:13.910 --> 36:16.498
- So, how is everything?
- Good.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.717
- Are we walking?
- Yeah, I don't know.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.371
Walk into the sunset?

36:20.395 --> 36:21.851
Why don't we just
stick together?

36:21.875 --> 36:22.982
This is my car, right here.

36:23.006 --> 36:24.182
- Really!
- Right there.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.073
- Are you warm enough?
- I am, thanks.

36:27.097 --> 36:29.032
I come straight from the work.
It wasn't too busy.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.555
Georgia covered
my tables for me.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.557
She's great, isn't she?

36:32.581 --> 36:33.930
The place is really
good for that.

36:35.149 --> 36:38.892
- It is.
- Hey, close your eyes.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.697
Go on! Come on, close your eyes.

36:41.721 --> 36:44.526
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

36:44.550 --> 36:47.355
Alright, just relax.

36:47.379 --> 36:51.489
You are on board my yacht.

36:51.513 --> 36:55.276
- You have a yacht?
- No, I have yachts, plural.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.888
More than one. It's what
you're used to, right?

36:58.912 --> 37:02.220
- Can I confess, not really.
- No?

37:03.351 --> 37:05.764
- Seasickness.
- Sea...

37:05.788 --> 37:08.071
No, this is my country.

37:08.095 --> 37:12.249
I decree that will be no
seasickness in my country.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.362
Oh, so you're a prince?

37:15.494 --> 37:18.671
I guess I am because
you are my princess.

37:21.630 --> 37:22.936
[soft music]

37:25.286 --> 37:26.916
[cell phone rings]

37:26.940 --> 37:30.900
- You have to get that?
- No, not really.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.469
But I should.

37:36.123 --> 37:37.864
- Oh, shit!
- Good news?

37:39.431 --> 37:42.584
I forgot I'm supposed to drop off
some sound equipment in the city.

37:42.608 --> 37:45.785
- Tonight?
- Glamorous like a Rock Star, right?

37:47.395 --> 37:50.069
I'm so sorry. Let me drop
you off on the way, though.

37:50.093 --> 37:52.202
Oh, no it's OK. My
girlfriend is meeting me

37:52.214 --> 37:54.335
at the club and she's
picking me up there.

37:54.359 --> 37:55.510
I'll walk.

37:55.534 --> 37:56.859
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

37:56.883 --> 37:59.538
It's okay, please don't worry.

38:01.975 --> 38:04.606
Bye! I'll catch you
When I get home.

38:04.630 --> 38:05.674
- See you.
- Bye.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.501
[coughing]

39:13.525 --> 39:14.830
[asthmatic breathing]

39:19.618 --> 39:20.899
[coughing and
asthmatic breathing]

39:20.923 --> 39:24.163
Esmeralda? Esmeralda!

39:24.187 --> 39:26.427
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.887
Is this it?

39:30.716 --> 39:32.171
I'm taking you to the hospital.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.739
No. No hospital.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.089
I have no insurance.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.265
But I have money. I have a job.

39:39.289 --> 39:42.510
I'm proud of you.
I'm proud of you.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.794
Medicine it helps.

39:45.818 --> 39:48.144
I'll be better now.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.257
Medicine will help.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.269
[coughing]

40:05.185 --> 40:06.185
Here you go.

40:07.753 --> 40:10.296
This is good for you. And
a hot tea is on the way.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.690
But don't you suppose
to go to work?

40:12.714 --> 40:15.171
Esmeralda, it's more important
for me to take care of you.

40:15.195 --> 40:19.305
No! That's more important.
That's why you're here to work.

40:19.329 --> 40:21.133
You must go.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.594
You eat.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.214
Is it good?

40:46.879 --> 40:49.708
So, if there aren't
any more comments?

40:50.796 --> 40:53.818
No? Really? You usually
have much more to say.

40:53.842 --> 40:59.607
OK, our fearless leader Mr. Brian
Steal would like to say a few words.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.131
Let's give it up for Brian!

41:02.155 --> 41:07.005
Please stop, no. No, please I said stop!
I said stop!

41:07.029 --> 41:11.967
Thank you, Shamila for that
lovely physical introduction.

41:11.991 --> 41:15.971
And yes, I am fearless when it comes to
saying that we have an amazing team here.

41:15.995 --> 41:17.625
What, come on!

41:17.649 --> 41:19.825
Word, word!

41:23.350 --> 41:24.525
You're late.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.965
- There was a line.
- Mhm.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.403
Hope you brought
enough for all of us.

41:35.928 --> 41:39.081
- I, I... Sorry I'm gonna...
- Sit.

41:39.105 --> 41:40.976
Can I grab a chair?

41:42.282 --> 41:44.502
- Holy...
- Free dental work.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.264
Sorry, it's my coffee.

41:48.288 --> 41:50.943
Okay. We'll take that
off your pay check.

41:52.553 --> 41:54.662
Okay, where was I?

41:54.686 --> 41:57.665
We had a good summer. I
want to thank you for that.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.580
Now we want to keep
that momentum up

41:59.604 --> 42:02.539
as we start into the fall season
and on into the holidays.

42:02.563 --> 42:06.717
And we know many of you have
other interests you're pursuing.

42:06.741 --> 42:08.197
We're fine supporting those.

42:08.221 --> 42:10.440
As long as the
shifts stay filled.

42:25.194 --> 42:26.413
What's up?

42:31.418 --> 42:33.614
[Dolores] Do you know where your
base is yet? We have no base,

42:33.638 --> 42:36.094
we have Helena, Rossmore...

42:36.118 --> 42:37.944
- Good evening, may I help you?
- We'll

42:37.956 --> 42:39.794
be three of us. The
other two are coming.

42:39.818 --> 42:42.013
- Okay, just wait right here, please.
- Sure.

42:42.037 --> 42:43.952
I'm gonna put them in
your section, Luiza.

42:48.566 --> 42:51.545
It is you! I knew it!

42:51.569 --> 42:54.330
Everyone is dying to know
what happened to you.

42:54.354 --> 42:57.202
I mean [indistinct]

42:57.226 --> 43:00.902
- Do I know you?
- Don't worry.

43:00.926 --> 43:02.512
Your secret is safe with me.

43:02.536 --> 43:04.209
I mean, who hasn't
stashed a little

43:04.233 --> 43:06.409
rainy day offshore fund, right?

43:07.976 --> 43:09.151
Table is ready.

43:10.152 --> 43:11.501
Follow me. Let's go.

43:12.633 --> 43:14.853
Oh, I'll have a Vodka Stinger.

43:22.687 --> 43:26.299
- Come on. You got it?
- What you mean, you got it?

43:27.387 --> 43:30.888
We already spoke about this. I
told you I was gonna go down.

43:30.912 --> 43:32.455
Told them, OK. I know.

43:32.479 --> 43:34.500
Then why are you
shitting me right now?

43:34.524 --> 43:35.743
Why are you trying to flee me?

43:36.918 --> 43:38.766
- You gotta stop, OK.
- Stop what?

43:38.790 --> 43:40.463
- I just wanna leave the group.
- Why are you getting

43:40.487 --> 43:41.682
all soft right now, man?

43:41.706 --> 43:43.422
What the fuck is going on, man?

43:43.446 --> 43:46.600
- Just chill, man.
- I told you it was good.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.819
- Stop it, alright!
- You and me don't understand each other.

43:48.843 --> 43:50.908
- What you're gonna do?
- Yo!

43:50.932 --> 43:53.065
Did you think you could
get away with it?

43:59.724 --> 44:02.006
Your table is ready, Brian.

44:02.030 --> 44:04.400
Georgina is on tonight.

44:04.424 --> 44:06.382
Hey, seat me the in new
girl section, will you?

44:07.732 --> 44:10.299
I wasn't sure I should bother
telling you about her.

44:11.213 --> 44:14.976
Shamila hired her against
my recommendations.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.978
It's OK, I'll take care of it.

44:17.002 --> 44:19.067
Ouch, she was late for the
meeting this morning.

44:19.091 --> 44:21.373
And we've had nothing
but problems with her.

44:21.397 --> 44:23.201
You should have had a maître d'.

44:23.225 --> 44:25.227
I've tried my best
to cope with it.

44:30.189 --> 44:32.254
Is the calamari's gluten free?

44:32.278 --> 44:34.628
She's being very careful.
She just started.

44:35.803 --> 44:37.999
I don't think so, it's breaded.

44:38.023 --> 44:40.871
Luiza, would you like to go
with me to the Polo Club

44:40.895 --> 44:43.091
for the match tomorrow?

44:43.115 --> 44:47.075
These two zombies here
are terrible bored.

44:49.948 --> 44:52.709
Do you have any other seafood?
You're so close to the ocean here.

44:52.733 --> 44:58.696
See? I obviously need someone who appreciate
the finer things in life to go with me.

45:00.959 --> 45:02.264
You have a new table over there.

45:09.184 --> 45:11.119
Hi, my name is Luiza.

45:11.143 --> 45:12.947
I'll be your server
this evening.

45:12.971 --> 45:15.732
Can I start you with
something to drink?

45:15.756 --> 45:17.062
I already have a beer.

45:19.325 --> 45:22.154
Can I tell you this
evening specials?

45:24.069 --> 45:27.788
Where are you from, Luiza?
I can't quite place it.

45:27.812 --> 45:29.267
Brazil.

45:29.291 --> 45:30.704
Oh!

45:30.728 --> 45:33.445
- Do you like the US?
- I love it.

45:33.469 --> 45:35.907
It's beautiful. Greenwich
is so beautiful.

45:37.822 --> 45:39.040
How long have you lived here?

45:40.520 --> 45:41.739
Am I in trouble?

45:43.349 --> 45:44.674
What makes you think
you're in trouble?

45:44.698 --> 45:46.458
I can totally explain

45:46.482 --> 45:48.243
why I was late this afternoon.

45:48.267 --> 45:51.313
- I take the bus.
- Someone like you takes the bus?

45:52.880 --> 45:57.363
I like it. I can read and I don't
need to worry about parking.

45:58.277 --> 46:01.212
Ah, yeah, I think he should
be ashamed of himself.

46:01.236 --> 46:02.387
- What?
- Your boyfriend.

46:02.411 --> 46:03.824
I think he should be ashamed

46:03.848 --> 46:05.197
that he doesn't
drive you himself.

46:06.241 --> 46:07.982
- I think he should.
- Yeah.

46:09.244 --> 46:11.657
If I was your boyfriend,
I would drive you myself

46:11.681 --> 46:13.379
every day, what do
you think of that?

46:14.902 --> 46:18.166
Maybe you could give me a car, and
I could drive myself to work.

46:19.602 --> 46:21.604
I'm sure that can be arranged.

46:23.345 --> 46:25.304
Are we still talking
about my boyfriend?

46:27.001 --> 46:28.631
Is he in the picture?

46:28.655 --> 46:31.155
Should I be speaking
to my boss like this?

46:31.179 --> 46:34.704
Sure, if your boss wanted you
to be more than an employee.

46:35.967 --> 46:40.101
Excuse me. Should I call in Andrea
to come in and take over the shift?

46:41.886 --> 46:45.498
I think that's a good idea. I'll be
driving Luiza home early tonight.

47:03.472 --> 47:05.581
[Brian] I'm glad you're
working at the restaurant.

47:05.605 --> 47:08.018
You'll make it a
much better place.

47:08.042 --> 47:09.739
[Luiza] I love working
at your restaurant.

47:13.308 --> 47:14.527
[Luiza] Thanks for the ride.

48:00.747 --> 48:02.401
[phone ringing]

48:14.761 --> 48:19.046
- Jose!
- Esmeralda, I will... Let me! Let me!

48:19.070 --> 48:21.004
Hello, who is this?

48:21.028 --> 48:22.701
Jose?

48:22.725 --> 48:25.554
Why are you whispering?
I am listening.

48:27.600 --> 48:30.666
What? I... I can't hear you.

48:30.690 --> 48:32.363
Are you Okay?

48:32.387 --> 48:34.496
Where is it?

48:34.520 --> 48:36.628
1503rd and Gleason.

48:36.652 --> 48:38.674
I know someone who can take me.

48:38.698 --> 48:40.981
Okay, okay! I'll come alone!

48:41.005 --> 48:43.984
- Why would I call the police?
- No, no police! No Police!

48:44.008 --> 48:45.376
- It's OK. Esmeralda!
- He's a good boy, Please help, no Police.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.987
I'll take care of it.

48:47.011 --> 48:50.120
It's okay. Let's just
get you back in bed.

48:50.144 --> 48:52.407
- It's Ok. Let's go, come on now.
- Please.

49:15.387 --> 49:17.060
[Luiza] I think I see
Gleason Street now.

49:17.084 --> 49:18.757
I want you to call
the police, OK.

49:18.781 --> 49:21.717
[Luiza] No! I promised
Esmeralda I wouldn't.

49:21.741 --> 49:23.458
Alright, I'll come and
meet you there then.

49:23.482 --> 49:26.504
I think it's coming up.
153 Gleason, right?

49:26.528 --> 49:29.401
No, no, no. Stay in the car.
Don't get out of the car.

49:30.532 --> 49:33.990
I'm here. Thank you so
much for your help.

49:34.014 --> 49:35.973
No, Luiza don't get
out of the car.

49:37.365 --> 49:38.671
Shit!

49:58.299 --> 49:59.387
[message sound]

50:05.567 --> 50:06.699
[Jose] Drive!

50:10.224 --> 50:12.768
[Luiza] You're gonna
be fine, Jose.

50:12.792 --> 50:15.534
[Luiza] Just wait, okay?

50:17.710 --> 50:19.644
[Luiza] Just stay quiet.

50:19.668 --> 50:23.083
Jose, relax. I'm telling
you it's gonna be fine.

50:23.107 --> 50:26.086
Why're you worrying about it. I'm here.
I'll take care of everything.

50:26.110 --> 50:27.522
- OK, just relax.
-[Jose] It doesn't

50:27.534 --> 50:28.958
make sense what you just did.

50:28.982 --> 50:31.613
- Please, just...
- You're just gonna get me arrested.

50:31.637 --> 50:34.050
You gonna get us in trouble
if you don't stay quiet.

50:34.074 --> 50:35.312
[knocking on window]

50:35.336 --> 50:37.401
Hi, officer.

50:37.425 --> 50:39.210
- How many...
- Is everything okay?

50:41.125 --> 50:43.538
- How many people in the car?
- Two people.

50:43.562 --> 50:46.478
Could you please not wake him up?
He's had a long day.

50:49.568 --> 50:52.025
License and registration
for me please.

50:52.049 --> 50:53.876
- Fine here.
- Thank you.

50:55.443 --> 50:58.553
So, my aunty is sick. So
I went to pick him up.

50:58.577 --> 51:00.144
He's Jose.

51:02.885 --> 51:06.300
Where is this from? This
doesn't look Spanish to me.

51:06.324 --> 51:10.415
It's Portuguese, I'm from Belorizonte,
Brazil. Have you visited?

51:12.895 --> 51:14.395
No, I haven't.

51:14.419 --> 51:16.571
How long are you here?

51:16.595 --> 51:18.921
Less than a week. I'm
supposed to go back tomorrow.

51:18.945 --> 51:21.382
But my aunty is sick. So I don't
know when I'm going back.

51:26.953 --> 51:30.454
You know, this isn't
a safe area of town.

51:30.478 --> 51:33.327
- How far are you going?
- Thompson street, do you know it?

51:33.351 --> 51:34.351
Thompson street, OK.

51:36.267 --> 51:40.160
You know, I think I
better escort you, OK?

51:40.184 --> 51:44.381
We have some check points set up. It
could take you a while to get through.

51:44.405 --> 51:47.408
Just give me a few seconds to pull out
in front and then you tail behind, OK?

51:48.540 --> 51:51.586
That's really nice of you.
Thank you, officer.

51:53.936 --> 51:57.046
What good does that do? He'll
arrest me when we get there anyway.

51:57.070 --> 52:00.789
Jose, I promise you he's not even
gonna notice you. Don't you worry.

52:00.813 --> 52:01.964
I got this.

52:01.988 --> 52:03.555
It's fine. I got it.

52:21.355 --> 52:25.074
Yeah, if... If you
ever need anything

52:25.098 --> 52:26.902
don't hesitate to call, okay?

52:26.926 --> 52:28.991
This is a pretty
rough neighborhood,

52:29.015 --> 52:31.583
so I know how it can get.

52:33.367 --> 52:34.367
But...

52:36.240 --> 52:38.827
- Bye now.
- Thank you.

52:38.851 --> 52:41.003
- Good night, officer.
- Good night.

52:41.027 --> 52:42.202
- Thank you.
- Good night.

53:06.879 --> 53:11.599
I hear a car and I didn't see you coming.
I thought you were dead.

53:11.623 --> 53:13.233
- I'm here, mama.
- Jose!

53:14.321 --> 53:16.105
I help you clean up
in the bathroom.

53:18.891 --> 53:19.891
Mom, I'm here, okay?

53:30.685 --> 53:32.837
I'll sleep in here
on the floor, okay?

53:32.861 --> 53:36.319
Thank you, Jose. It's better
if I sleep with Esmeralda.

53:36.343 --> 53:37.779
You sleep in your room tonight.

53:46.571 --> 53:47.789
I have to tell you something.

53:51.489 --> 53:55.884
If I had a daughter, I
want her just like you.

54:20.082 --> 54:21.082
[sound of text message]

54:35.794 --> 54:36.794
[sound of text message]

54:39.754 --> 54:40.799
[sound of text message]

54:49.982 --> 54:50.983
[sound of text message]

54:55.988 --> 54:57.598
[happy music]

55:13.048 --> 55:15.007
[Brazilian song playing]

55:47.822 --> 55:50.366
Oh, everything is right, Luiza.

55:50.390 --> 55:52.194
Georgia called, she
says she's on her way.

55:52.218 --> 55:53.674
Thank you too.

55:53.698 --> 55:55.240
And Dolores.

55:55.264 --> 55:56.633
We should have called
you this morning,

55:56.657 --> 55:57.808
but we'd thought
it would be better

55:57.832 --> 55:59.462
to tell you this in person.

55:59.486 --> 56:02.359
We're sorry, but we've
gonna have to let you go.

56:03.838 --> 56:06.643
To the party!

56:06.667 --> 56:08.365
Why would I want to
go to the party?

56:09.540 --> 56:11.387
Gentlemen!

56:11.411 --> 56:14.434
Mr. Robles! Happy birthday!

56:14.458 --> 56:16.566
Thank you. Hello, gorgeous.

56:16.590 --> 56:18.525
I am looking forward
to the party today.

56:18.549 --> 56:19.854
We are glad to have you.

56:20.942 --> 56:22.988
Who is this beautiful
looking lady?

56:25.382 --> 56:28.385
I hope you will be free tonight,
for at least a drink at my table.

56:30.256 --> 56:33.148
Mr. Robles. Let me make
sure your table is ready.

56:33.172 --> 56:34.434
Absolutely.

56:42.268 --> 56:44.725
[Luiza] People paint a
picture of a perfect world.

56:44.749 --> 56:47.292
And it doesn't turn out,
their lives fall apart.

56:47.316 --> 56:49.512
But if you make home
wherever you are,

56:49.536 --> 56:52.776
you find happiness even if
it's not what you planned.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.430
I think this is true

56:54.454 --> 56:56.127
even for Burguesinha.

56:56.151 --> 56:57.283
[rhythmic music]

57:06.814 --> 57:10.514
[Luiza] Ben got his chance to sing
at the restaurant whenever he liked.

57:11.645 --> 57:15.083
Jose started his own music
production business.

57:16.607 --> 57:19.523
Esmeralda is even
started to date.

57:21.873 --> 57:24.852
It's Portuguese, I'm from
Belorizonte, Brazil.

57:24.876 --> 57:26.791
Have you visited?

57:28.270 --> 57:31.056
Are you having a sale for that
stupid church you go to? No!

57:31.926 --> 57:33.556
Shit!

57:33.580 --> 57:34.580
[laughter]

57:35.713 --> 57:37.342
[indistinct]

57:37.366 --> 57:38.890
What is a "inter locker"?

57:40.457 --> 57:43.460
You're fine. You're
here to sleep with me?

57:45.853 --> 57:48.900
Oh, you should be on
your knees, brother.

57:53.861 --> 57:56.449
- Is that what you're wearing?
- [Luiza] I know, I'm sorry

57:56.473 --> 57:58.475
I didn't have time to
go home and change.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.129
You can change back there.

58:04.350 --> 58:06.439
Can I start you with
something to drink?

58:07.788 --> 58:09.181
I already have a beer.

58:13.228 --> 58:15.990
Uh, uh. This is my country.
I decree

58:16.014 --> 58:19.297
that there will be no
seasickness in my country.
