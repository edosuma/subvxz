Does Bella take everything?
Does she take Cameron?

00:05.880 --> 00:09.320
Hey, Cam, you wanna join me
in the hall for the crowning today?

00:09.480 --> 00:10.960
What happened to my mother?

00:11.080 --> 00:14.760
Now you're head of the Circle,
can you help me find out the truth?

00:14.920 --> 00:18.080
What? What is it?
The end of Cameron.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.920
Cameron?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.560
# I left my friends for my new life

00:25.760 --> 00:28.680
# How will I know it's gonna be all right?

00:28.880 --> 00:35.560
# I gotta take control
And run my destiny

01:02.600 --> 01:05.600
When? When does it happen?

01:05.800 --> 01:08.760
When the sky turns green over Evermoor.

01:09.560 --> 01:11.000
Which means...

01:13.520 --> 01:14.840
it’s imminent.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
"The sky turns green"?
What does that mean?

01:19.160 --> 01:23.320
Every so often, the bog fouls the air
with the stench of rotting bogween,

01:23.480 --> 01:25.200
driving everyone indoors.

01:25.400 --> 01:30.040
(SIGHS)
The green sky... is its warning.

01:32.840 --> 01:36.680
So Cameron’s fate will come to pass

01:36.880 --> 01:39.840
on the next Night of the Stench.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.960
Sometime before the morning bells
give the all-clear.

01:55.560 --> 01:59.960
"Green sky bright,
the bog will stink tonight."

02:01.520 --> 02:03.920
Lacie, tell your father to ring the bells.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.800

Mr. Doyle, will you be holding
your usual stench marathon competition?

02:20.320 --> 02:22.280
I certainly will, Ms. Carmichael.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.800
And this time, the prize will be
a month’s supply of Yuck.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.040
That'll set the hogs honking.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.480
Did you hear that?
A month’s supply of chocolate!

02:34.600 --> 02:36.040

I’m not allowed to do that
without Esmerelda here.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.120

Yes, if you try to predict rain,

-you’ll only make it rain.
-Yeah, I got it.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.920

05:45.520 --> 05:48.920
I've been researching
the night Sarah disappeared.

05:50.280 --> 05:53.800
Cameron says she entered the woods
en route to the next village,

05:53.960 --> 05:57.920
but according to travel records,
she never showed up there.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.520
So she didn’t make it out of the woods?

06:01.400 --> 06:02.960
Look, I know it sounds nuts,

06:03.080 --> 06:06.040
but I found all these stories
of sightings in the woods,

glimpses of what the locals call
"the hermit."

06:09.040 --> 06:11.680

06:11.880 --> 06:16.400
Big question is,
why hasn’t she come back for Cameron?

06:19.960 --> 06:23.600
Good.
Now tape up the windows and the doors.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.640
Last girl kneeling: Lacie!

16:08.400 --> 16:10.320
My father’s the bell ringer.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.120
The early bell was my birthday present.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.560
(JAKE GRUNTS)

16:17.720 --> 16:21.440
Here.
(LUDO YELLS)

16:27.000 --> 16:29.960
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

16:38.640 --> 16:39.800
We were just talking.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.800
No. It’s more than that. It’s Fate.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.280
Tara, we have so much in common,
you know?

16:47.440 --> 16:51.240
We share the same interests;
practically the same thoughts.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.560
And Bella and I...

16:55.080 --> 16:57.880
We're matching heights.
Like wedding cake toppers.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.240
Perfect.
Right.

17:00.400 --> 17:04.000
But we’re also Fated.
My mother’s prophecy.

17:04.120 --> 17:07.840
I’ve tried to ignore it, but I can’t.
What prophecy?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.080
That her son would be the soulmate
of the Supreme Everine.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.160
It was written on the tapestry.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.600
It’s why she left the Circle.
It’s the reason I exist.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.760
Will you excuse me?

17:21.960 --> 17:24.760
-Where are you going?
-She’s not the Supreme.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.080
It’s me. I’m the Supreme Everine.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.320
-No. Esmerelda said --
-She was wrong.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.000
-Bella showed Esmerelda her magic.
-It was my magic.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.720
I’ll prove it to you.
Ask me anything. I’ll grant you any wish.

17:42.360 --> 17:47.280
I want to be with my mother.
Can you make that happen?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.160
(BRANCHES CRUNCHING)

17:55.520 --> 17:57.680
(CRUNCH)
The hermit?

17:59.280 --> 18:02.920
I bet you’re wondering
what I’m doing out in this stench?

18:03.040 --> 18:06.920
I just sent Esmerelda down the bog path,

18:07.040 --> 18:10.120
with no memory of discovering
the Supreme Everine.

18:10.280 --> 18:14.400
So the one person
you thought could stop me

18:14.600 --> 18:17.760
crumpled like a frozen bog leaf.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.440
Don’t get yourself so worked up.
It won’t do you any good.

18:27.080 --> 18:31.560
All hope is lost.
The Supreme Everine is on my side.

18:32.800 --> 18:37.200
There’s no one left
who can make you human again, Sarah.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.240
Sarah?

18:46.880 --> 18:52.000
(BREATHES)
Watch. You’ll like this.

18:59.640 --> 19:04.720
Oh, tapestry, great tapestry!
I grant Cameron’s wish!

19:04.880 --> 19:07.240
Bring him and his mother together.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.840
(WHIRRING SOUND)

19:38.440 --> 19:40.000
It really is you.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.760
Any second, you’ll be reunited
with your mom.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.720

19:52.440 --> 19:56.000
Tara!

19:58.920 --> 20:03.120
(CRACKLING CONTINUOUSLY)

20:08.160 --> 20:09.200
Cameron!

20:09.360 --> 20:11.760
Well then, Sarah.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.200
Things are going better than expected.

20:17.640 --> 20:22.600
(WIND HOWLING)

20:26.440 --> 20:27.440
Cameron!

20:30.280 --> 20:32.320
Next time...

20:32.520 --> 20:35.880
-Drifty?
-Hey, Princess. It's your old pal!

20:36.000 --> 20:38.360
This stuff should be called
golden problems.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.440
What is this, stuffed roadkill?

20:40.640 --> 20:46.000
Not only does it make me talk,
but my lullaby sends people to sleep.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.280
Forever!
