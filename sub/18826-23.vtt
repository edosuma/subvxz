- Presenting Dicky's double

00:11.250 --> 00:16.166
surprise... meatloaf.

00:19.750 --> 00:21.083
- That's a chicken.

00:21.125 --> 00:22.291
- Surprise!

00:24.875 --> 00:27.166
- [coughs]

00:24.875 --> 00:27.166
That tastes like meatloaf.

00:27.208 --> 00:29.083
- Double surprise!

00:29.125 --> 00:31.625
- Why did we let him cook again?

00:31.667 --> 00:35.125
- So, while this cools,

00:31.667 --> 00:35.125
how's school going?

00:35.166 --> 00:36.667
You guys excited

00:35.166 --> 00:36.667
about graduating?

00:36.709 --> 00:38.458
- Oh, well, graduation's

00:36.709 --> 00:38.458
cool and all,

00:38.500 --> 00:41.208
but we are way more psyched

00:38.500 --> 00:41.208
about our Sayonara Stunt.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.083
- The outgoing class

00:41.250 --> 00:43.083
does a stunt at the end

00:43.125 --> 00:45.500
of the school year so their

00:43.125 --> 00:45.500
legacy will be remembered.

00:45.542 --> 00:48.333

00:45.542 --> 00:48.333
a Sayonara Stunt is.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.709
- We invented that term

00:48.375 --> 00:50.709
30 years ago

00:50.750 --> 00:52.750
when we were on

00:50.750 --> 00:52.750
the Stunt Committee at Edgewood.

00:52.792 --> 00:54.667

00:54.709 --> 00:56.166

00:56.208 --> 00:58.583
Our first meeting is tonight

00:58.625 --> 01:00.625
and we wanna do

00:58.625 --> 01:00.625
something awesome.

01:00.667 --> 01:03.458
Like the Butt Bench.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.667
- See, a long time ago,

01:03.500 --> 01:06.667
the school had just put

01:06.709 --> 01:08.583
a new concrete bench

01:06.709 --> 01:08.583
in the front entryway.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.834
- Then, two anonymous kids

01:08.625 --> 01:10.834
left their butt prints

01:10.875 --> 01:12.583
in the wet cement.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.583
- And they've been there

01:12.625 --> 01:13.959
ever since.

01:12.625 --> 01:13.959
- Oh, we know

01:14.000 --> 01:15.542
what the Butt Bench is.

01:15.583 --> 01:19.250
In fact, does this ring a bell?

01:19.291 --> 01:20.625
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.500
- That's right.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.500
You guys, our behinds

01:24.542 --> 01:26.125
are the behinds left behind

01:24.542 --> 01:26.125

01:29.667 --> 01:31.333
How come you never

01:29.667 --> 01:31.333
told us before?

01:31.375 --> 01:32.834
- Oh, we didn't tell anybody.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.208
Not everyone approved

01:32.875 --> 01:34.208
of the stunt.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.583
- You have no idea

01:34.250 --> 01:35.583
how hard it's been,

01:35.625 --> 01:37.166
keeping it to ourselves.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.166
- [laughs]

01:37.208 --> 01:38.709
- It's like a crushing weight

01:37.208 --> 01:38.709
on our chest.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.917
I mean, it's so good to finally

01:38.750 --> 01:40.917
tell someone.

01:40.959 --> 01:43.375
But don't tell anyone!

01:43.417 --> 01:46.333
- Wow, I hope our stunt

01:43.417 --> 01:46.333
can last as long as yours did.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.333
- Aw, thanks, honey.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.333
It warms my heart to know

01:48.375 --> 01:51.041
that our gluteus made maximus

01:48.375 --> 01:51.041

01:51.083 --> 01:52.500

01:51.083 --> 01:52.500
- Right?

01:52.542 --> 01:54.625
[laughter]

01:54.667 --> 01:56.709
- Well, it's too bad

01:54.667 --> 01:56.709
they're getting rid of it.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.166
- The bench?

01:56.750 --> 01:59.166
What? Why?

01:59.208 --> 02:01.000
- Well, they're remodeling

01:59.208 --> 02:01.000
the whole front of the school

02:01.041 --> 02:03.542
next week and the bench

02:01.041 --> 02:03.542
is the first thing to go.

02:03.583 --> 02:05.375
- Apparently,

02:03.583 --> 02:05.375
it's a health hazard.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.667
Every time it rains, the butt

02:05.417 --> 02:08.667
puddles bring mosquitoes.

You can go and see if you can

02:16.542 --> 02:18.417
change their minds.

02:18.458 --> 02:20.792
- Yeah, and give us a ride

02:18.458 --> 02:20.792

02:20.834 --> 02:24.208
We've got a Sayonara Stunt

02:20.834 --> 02:24.208

02:24.250 --> 02:26.959
very hard on a nice meal for us.

So let's eat.

- Pick off

05:29.917 --> 05:31.709
the Sayonara Stunt list,

05:31.750 --> 05:34.041
or you will all be saying,

05:31.750 --> 05:34.041
"Konnichiwa" to summer school.

05:36.041 --> 05:39.291
That's Japanese for "hello."

the quads are right.

06:34.291 --> 06:35.333
all: What?

06:35.375 --> 06:37.208
- We need to go big.

06:37.250 --> 06:39.208
And I think the quad should be

06:37.250 --> 06:39.208
in charge of planning it.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.709
After all, who's better

06:39.250 --> 06:41.709
at going big than them?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.375

06:54.959 --> 06:57.000
super secret committee

06:57.041 --> 06:58.291
to come up with

06:57.041 --> 06:58.291
a Sayonara Stunt.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.917

07:00.959 --> 07:02.458
All right.

07:00.959 --> 07:02.458
So anybody got any ideas?

07:02.500 --> 07:05.542
- Ooh!

07:02.500 --> 07:05.542

07:05.583 --> 07:07.792

- Anything else?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.041
- I got nothing.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.041

07:15.083 --> 07:16.250

07:16.291 --> 07:18.333

07:18.375 --> 07:21.792
We don't have Chinese food.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.750
- Chinese food?

07:23.792 --> 07:25.709
- Yeah.

07:23.792 --> 07:25.709
Whenever they have to

07:25.750 --> 07:26.750
think of something in movies,

07:26.792 --> 07:28.125
they always get Chinese food

07:28.166 --> 07:29.834
and eat it right out of the box.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.000

07:43.625 --> 07:45.834
a flurry of ideas coming on.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.500
- That billboard on Main, right?

07:47.542 --> 07:49.166
- That's a good idea.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.166
- And we'll just do--

07:49.208 --> 07:50.500
Oh, hey, kids.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.500
I guess we'll have to

07:50.542 --> 07:51.875

07:50.542 --> 07:51.875

07:51.917 --> 07:53.375
- Wait, why do you guys

07:51.917 --> 07:53.375
need a classroom?

07:53.417 --> 07:55.458
- Oh, you know, for some

07:53.417 --> 07:55.458
very important stuff.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.250
- We were fighting

07:55.500 --> 07:57.250
to save the Butt Bench.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.000
And it seemed like

07:57.291 --> 07:59.000
everyone was against us.

07:59.041 --> 08:02.083
But then, all of a sudden,

07:59.041 --> 08:02.083
Principal Tarian picked us

08:02.125 --> 08:04.083
to form a super secret committee

08:04.125 --> 08:05.166
to figure out how to save it.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.375
- It's a pretty big honor.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.667
- Oh, yeah.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.667
- Wait, so Principal Tarian

08:09.709 --> 08:12.000
just suddenly changed

08:09.709 --> 08:12.000
everyone's minds?

08:12.041 --> 08:15.458
- And put you two in charge

08:12.041 --> 08:15.458

08:15.500 --> 08:17.291
- Doesn't that seem

08:15.500 --> 08:17.291
a little fishy?

08:17.333 --> 08:19.375
Like, maybe he was just trying

08:17.333 --> 08:19.375
to get rid of you.

08:23.041 --> 08:24.834

08:24.875 --> 08:26.750
- Well, what are you guys

08:24.875 --> 08:26.750
doing in here?

08:26.792 --> 08:29.709
- Oh, well, we are working on

08:26.792 --> 08:29.709
real very important stuff.

08:29.750 --> 08:32.041
- We were fighting to change

08:29.750 --> 08:32.041

08:32.083 --> 08:33.709
- It seemed like everyone

08:32.083 --> 08:33.709
was against us.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.667
- Then, suddenly,

08:33.750 --> 08:35.667
Natlee changed her mind.

08:35.709 --> 08:37.291
- Oh, and sent you

08:35.709 --> 08:37.291
in here to form

08:37.333 --> 08:38.792
a super secret committee?

08:38.834 --> 08:39.792

08:38.834 --> 08:39.792
Yeah!

08:39.834 --> 08:41.500
Ohh.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.583

08:48.625 --> 08:51.083
- Well, I mean, I'm sure

08:48.625 --> 08:51.083
it's just a misunderstanding.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.667
I mean, Mae would

08:51.125 --> 08:52.667
never trick us.

08:52.709 --> 08:56.083
I'll just go in there

08:52.709 --> 08:56.083
and ask her what's up.

08:56.125 --> 08:58.625
- If they didn't trick us,

08:56.125 --> 08:58.625
then why is the door locked?

08:58.667 --> 09:01.041

the door's locked

09:01.083 --> 09:02.917
doesn't mean that they meant--

Just 'cause they closed

09:06.542 --> 09:08.500
they meant to trick--

09:12.041 --> 09:14.959

09:15.000 --> 09:16.750

09:16.792 --> 09:19.125

09:22.166 --> 09:24.917

19:34.000 --> 19:36.250
Natlee has great penmanship.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.959
- It's not about

19:36.291 --> 19:37.959
the "penmanshop."

19:38.000 --> 19:42.500
- No, it's about you guys always

19:38.000 --> 19:42.500
messing everything up.

19:42.542 --> 19:45.667
- True, this wasn't

19:42.542 --> 19:45.667
our best day.

19:45.709 --> 19:48.667
- But if you guys

19:45.709 --> 19:48.667
give us another chance,

19:48.709 --> 19:51.709
the super secret committee

19:48.709 --> 19:51.709
has a plan to fix this.

19:57.917 --> 20:01.333

20:04.208 --> 20:07.792
- Today, I'm here to dedicate

20:04.208 --> 20:07.792
our school's new entryway.

20:07.834 --> 20:12.875
But before I do, I present the

20:07.834 --> 20:12.875
class of 2017's Sayonara Stunt.

20:16.667 --> 20:18.250
Move, kids,

20:16.667 --> 20:18.250
so everyone can see

20:18.291 --> 20:20.083
that adorable little

20:18.291 --> 20:20.083
inscription.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.250
Why are you stepping out

20:22.750 --> 20:25.250
of your shoes?

20:25.291 --> 20:27.792
What is the meaning of this?

20:27.834 --> 20:29.792
- Sorry, Principal Tarian,

20:27.834 --> 20:29.792
but we just wanted

20:29.834 --> 20:32.250
to pull off a stunt the whole

20:29.834 --> 20:32.250
class could call their own.

20:32.291 --> 20:34.375
- Something that actually

20:32.291 --> 20:34.375
represented us.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.709
- So we cemented our shoes

20:34.417 --> 20:36.709
into the ground.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.625
- I can only guess

20:36.750 --> 20:39.625
whose idea this was.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.709
This has Harper quads

20:39.667 --> 20:41.709
written all over it.

20:41.750 --> 20:45.917
- Um, actually, it has

20:41.750 --> 20:45.917
2017 written all over it.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.834
- Oh, yeah, I see it now.

20:52.875 --> 20:56.458
- But it wasn't just

20:52.875 --> 20:56.458
the Harpers, it was all of us.

20:56.500 --> 20:59.500
We wanted to tell future classes

20:56.500 --> 20:59.500
that the class of 2017

20:59.542 --> 21:02.208
left some pretty big shoes

20:59.542 --> 21:02.208
to fill.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.709
- Well, this wasn't on my list,

21:03.750 --> 21:07.250
and it certainly wasn't

21:03.750 --> 21:07.250
principal-approved.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.834
But it is pretty inspired.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.709
[all sighing]

21:10.750 --> 21:13.750
- Those are our kids, Tom.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.750
I've never been so proud.

21:13.792 --> 21:16.166
- Our Butt Bench brought out

21:13.792 --> 21:16.166
the best of them.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.917
- Your Butt Bench?

21:17.959 --> 21:19.750
- Ah, that's right, Arthur.

21:19.792 --> 21:24.333
The Butt Bench was brought

21:19.792 --> 21:24.333
to you by the Harper heinies.

21:24.375 --> 21:25.834
- Ding-a-ling-a-ling!

21:25.875 --> 21:27.458
- Ding-a-ling-a-ling?

21:27.500 --> 21:29.000
- Thanks for making our

21:27.500 --> 21:29.000
Sayonara Stunt

21:29.041 --> 21:30.917
way more memorable.

21:30.959 --> 21:34.333
- Maybe now our legacy won't be

21:30.959 --> 21:34.333
that we always quadded up.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.625
- You're right.

21:35.667 --> 21:39.083
This time,

21:35.667 --> 21:39.083
you were able to quad it up.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.583
- What do you know?

21:39.125 --> 21:40.583
We were able to turn

21:40.625 --> 21:43.041
"quad it up" into a good thing.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.959
- Good thing?

21:43.083 --> 21:44.959
Forget that.

My wig stunt it about to

21:45.000 --> 21:48.250

21:49.583 --> 21:51.125
