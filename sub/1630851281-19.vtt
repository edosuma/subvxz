Ow!
What is going on?

01:02.149 --> 01:03.802
That guy
is serial-killer creepy.

01:03.846 --> 01:06.588
Like, he tried to get me
to go inside with him.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.242
I'm calling 911.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.683
It's Bailey's

01:14.726 --> 01:15.901

01:15.945 --> 01:17.207
Oh, I hate it.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.079
House is too quiet.

01:19.122 --> 01:21.211
Keep making an extra cup of
coffee for her without thinking.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.213
I-I did laundry
last night --

01:23.257 --> 01:25.259
not a single, weird,
frilly thing

01:25.302 --> 01:27.043
that I don't know how to fold anyway.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.566
Kinda sounds like
you guys live together.

01:28.610 --> 01:29.828
Whoa! No!

01:29.872 --> 01:31.134
No, we're not ready
for that.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.918
She just stays over sometimes.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.572
A -- A lot of times.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.228
Oh, my God. Did we accidentally

you can survive

Signs of forced entry.

02:01.512 --> 02:02.687

Captions by VITAC--

03:02.007 --> 03:03.226
You sure you're okay?

03:03.270 --> 03:04.706
Yes, sir.
Just a little banged up.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.490
That explosion took out power
to most of the Valley.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.927
Gonna take at least 12 hours
to restore it.

03:08.971 --> 03:10.668
Here come the feds.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.241
Matt,
how have you been?

03:18.285 --> 03:20.069
Me? Anxious.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.679
We've been hearing rumors
about a potential terror attack

03:21.723 --> 03:23.551
for weeks,
and now it's happened.

03:23.594 --> 03:24.987
Have you met Agent Fox?

03:25.030 --> 03:26.641
- Sgt. Grey: No. Wade Grey.
- Casey Fox.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.034
That's Sergeant Bradford,
Officers Nolan and Chen.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.862
Clearly, you're the ones
who found the bomb.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.429
Can you describe it?

03:32.473 --> 03:34.126
Not really.
All I saw was a timer,

03:34.170 --> 03:36.041
some wires, and then I was
running for my life.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.696
Same, but my impression was that
it was fairly rudimentary.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.220
Well, the bomb guys
will get in there.

03:40.263 --> 03:41.264
They'll take a look
once it's safe,

03:41.308 --> 03:42.613
and hopefully
there's something left

03:42.657 --> 03:44.441
that we can trace back
to a source.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.835
Of all the targets in the city,
why hit this place?

03:46.878 --> 03:48.880
I mean, there's no potential
for casualties.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.839
All they can do is knock out
power to the Valley.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.275
I don't know yet,

03:52.319 --> 03:53.842
but there is a possibility
that this attack

03:53.885 --> 03:55.278
is only the beginning,

03:55.322 --> 03:56.888
which is why the FBI
is taking over.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.586
Matt, this guy almost killed
two of my officers.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.283
We're not just gonna stand
on the sidelines.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.114
Okay.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.550
Let's "Super Friends"
the investigation --

04:06.594 --> 04:08.552
joint task force.
The first thing we need to do

04:08.596 --> 04:11.163
is talk to all the witnesses
who called 911.

04:11.207 --> 04:12.295
Thanks for riding
with me today.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.688
Yeah, of course.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.472
I'm happy to keep filling in
on the detective side.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.865
Because it keeps you out
of uniform.

04:16.908 --> 04:18.301
God, yes.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.260
I feel like I'm already,
like, 90 months pregnant.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.306
What?!

04:23.350 --> 04:26.614
Uh, Professor Meadows,
I am Detective Harper.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.311
This is Detective Lopez.

04:28.355 --> 04:29.747
You called about
an intruder.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.228
Yes. Yes.
Thank you for coming.

04:35.579 --> 04:38.365
I woke up in the middle
of the night,

04:38.408 --> 04:39.540
and there was someone
in my bedroom.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.889
Can you describe him?

04:40.932 --> 04:42.847
I can do better.
I sketched him.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.504
Now, where did I put
that drawing?

04:47.548 --> 04:49.201
Uh, he was an alien.

04:49.245 --> 04:52.466
I can...tell you that much
to start.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.424
You could tell
he was undocumented

04:54.468 --> 04:55.947
just by looking
at him?

04:55.991 --> 04:58.298
No, no, no, no,
not that kind of alien.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.908
No, he was, uh...

04:59.951 --> 05:01.910
Oh.

05:01.953 --> 05:04.347
He was a Heptapod.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.175
With cosmically
awful breath.

05:07.611 --> 05:10.832
Oh, and, um, how do you know
it was a he?

05:10.875 --> 05:13.791
Well, it was more
of a feeling I got.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.794
I-I certainly didn't see
any external genitalia,

05:16.838 --> 05:18.753
or I would have put it
in the sketch.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.711
Mr. Meadows, are you on
any medications?

05:20.755 --> 05:22.670
Why does everyone
always ask me that?

05:22.713 --> 05:24.802
Listen to me.

05:24.846 --> 05:28.806
An alien broke into my house
and stole my manuscript --

05:28.850 --> 05:32.157
<i>the</i> definitive treatise
on Los Angeles traffic patterns.

05:32.201 --> 05:35.639
Why would an alien
travel across the galaxy

05:35.683 --> 05:38.207
for a book on traffic?

05:38.250 --> 05:41.558
Understanding traffic is the key
to human colonization.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.386
Right.
Of course.

05:43.430 --> 05:47.216
You -- You think I'm crazy,
but I-I can prove it happened.

05:47.259 --> 05:50.175
The alien attacked me.

05:50.219 --> 05:52.569
I only survived because
I managed to lock myself

05:52.613 --> 05:53.788
in the bathroom.

05:57.052 --> 05:59.359
He's white, dark hair, 30s.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.621
With a scar
under his left eye.

06:00.664 --> 06:01.665
And he had an accent.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.580
Um...couldn't quite
place it.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.016
Well, it was Russian.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.844
Yeah, he sounded just like
Vladislav Ivanov.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.455
- Who?
- Lelush.

06:10.544 --> 06:12.154
<i>The super-hot model</i> <i>
who was trapped</i>

06:12.197 --> 06:14.635
<i>on that Chinese
reality singing show. I mean...</i>

06:14.678 --> 06:17.159
Can that be right?
Oh, yeah,
Lelush is super cute.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.900
No, I mean, the -

06:18.943 --> 06:21.293
We need to pull them out.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.774
TID got a partial on a piece
of the explosive device.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.298
Prints came back
for an Ezekiel Freemont.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.039
That is not
a scar-faced Russian.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.041

with a terror cell.

08:32.294 --> 08:35.297
Where the hell did you learn
to drive like that?

08:35.340 --> 08:36.994
Claybourne High School
in D.C.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.649
I was a guidance counselor there
for 20 years.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.522
Taught Driver's Ed for
eight of 'em, till they realized

08:42.565 --> 08:45.263
I was using the time to teach
myself and my students

08:45.307 --> 08:47.222
advanced
driving techniques.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.529
I also coached
the wrestling team

08:49.572 --> 08:52.444
'cause I wanted to perfect
my hand-to-hand fighting style

08:52.488 --> 08:55.970
so I could pursue my dream
of becoming an FBI Agent.

08:56.013 --> 08:59.408
That's a...fun story.

08:59.451 --> 09:02.019
But the FBI has a very specific
way of doing things,

09:02.063 --> 09:04.065
and a 50-year-old --
48.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.893
48-year-old
former high school teacher

09:05.936 --> 09:10.767
with a "Fast & Furious" fetish
doesn't really fit our model.

09:10.811 --> 09:13.465
Did I make a single mistake
on the driving course?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.206
No.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.339
Did I successfully
pit-maneuver this car

09:17.382 --> 09:19.428
and put the suspect
under arrest?

09:19.471 --> 09:20.821
Yes.

09:20.864 --> 09:23.301
Alright, then I don't understand
what the problem is.

09:23.345 --> 09:26.653
Trainee...you are trying
to succeed at an agency

09:26.696 --> 09:30.482
where J. Edgar Hoover once fired
an agent for having acne.

09:30.526 --> 09:33.181
You're either FBI material
or you're not.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.930
- Simone Clark?
- Yes, sir.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.541
Do you remember a student named
Ezekiel Freemont?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.238
Zeke. Yes, sir.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.198
He's the main suspect in
a terror attack in Los Angeles.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.635
You're going to L.A. to brief
investigative agents

09:52.679 --> 09:53.941
on Mr. Freemont.

09:53.984 --> 09:54.811
Happy to help, sir.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.120
Have yourself
a very good day...sir.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.164
Keegan:
Let's go, Clark.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.959
Based on his history,
our suspect clearly shares

10:12.002 --> 10:13.874
several personality traits
with Ted Kaczynski,

10:13.917 --> 10:15.223
otherwise known
as the Unabomber.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.676
Whoops.
Don't mind me.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.852
I -- I'm just gonna
tuck in over here.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.682
Ooh.
Excuse me, handsome.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.250
No problem.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.731
As I was saying,
Ezekiel Freemont fits

10:44.774 --> 10:47.516
the classic mold of a high-IQ,
low-empathy psychopath.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.823
No,
that's not right.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.128
Did you say something?

10:51.172 --> 10:52.782
No, no, no.
Keep goin'.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.091
Becoming a bomber speaks
to his deep sense of anger

10:57.134 --> 10:58.483
and his impotency.

10:58.527 --> 10:59.702
But social and sexual tendencies...

10:59.746 --> 11:01.095
- Oh, Lord.
- Excuse me.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.400
This is... Who are you?

11:02.444 --> 11:04.968
I'm Simone Clark.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.492
I-I just flew in
from the Academy.

11:07.536 --> 11:10.147
I was Zeke's guidance counselor
for three years in D.C.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.976
Right. Step out so everybody
can see you.

11:13.020 --> 11:16.937
You clearly disagree
with Marlin's profile.

11:16.980 --> 11:20.288
I just don't recognize
the kid he's describing.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.246
Zeke grew up
in a violent home.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.771
Had sensory-overload issues
because of it.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.991
But I found him to be
a deeply empathetic person

11:28.035 --> 11:29.732
who isolated himself
from others

11:29.776 --> 11:32.387
as a protection mechanism.

11:32.430 --> 11:34.389
With all due respect,
you're a guidance counselor.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.957
I'm a trained
behavioral scientist

11:37.000 --> 11:38.567
with three decades'
experience.

11:38.610 --> 11:41.744
And I got mad respect for you,
even if you don't appreciate

11:41.788 --> 11:44.486
what a good guidance counselor
brings to the table.

11:44.529 --> 11:47.576
I've worked with literally
thousands of young men and women

11:47.619 --> 11:49.230
at their
most formative age,

11:49.273 --> 11:52.581
from future criminals
to future millionaires

11:52.624 --> 11:54.409
and everything
in between,

11:54.452 --> 11:56.628
and that made me
an expert on people.

11:56.672 --> 11:57.978
Where do you think Zeke
is hiding right now?

11:58.021 --> 12:00.545
Someplace dark and quiet.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.504
When the world
got overwhelming,

12:02.547 --> 12:04.767
he just went someplace
to hide.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.335
He feels safest underground.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.511
Thank you for your insight,
Trainee Clark,

12:09.554 --> 12:12.732
but I'm gonna trust our profiler
on this one.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.865
The guy that you knew in D.C.,
he's no longer the same guy.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.346
We think that he's part
of a terrorist cell

12:18.389 --> 12:20.435
intending to strike this city again.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.263
And we need to catch him
before they set off a bomb --

12:22.306 --> 12:23.917
one that kills innocent people
this time.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.266
So let's get to work.

12:33.883 --> 12:38.932
Um... I just want to say, I am so
sorry for speaking out of turn.

12:38.975 --> 12:42.283
So, w-what can I do now?
I mean, how can I help?

12:42.326 --> 12:44.459
Y-You can't.

12:44.502 --> 12:45.895
You should just go back
to the Academy.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.854
The travel office
is on the fourth floor.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.030
They'll give you a voucher for
a coach seat back to Virginia.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.162
So, no private jet?

12:52.206 --> 12:54.077
Pr--

12:54.121 --> 12:55.949
Je-- No.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.037
Excuse me.

13:06.742 --> 13:09.571
That was pretty brave,
the way you spoke up in there.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.924
Thank you, but I don't think
I did myself any favors.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.970
John Nolan.
Simone Clark.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.886
Did you hang back 'cause you
wanted to get my phone number?

13:19.929 --> 13:21.801
No, ma'am.
Just to tell you,

13:21.844 --> 13:23.933
I think they were wrong to
dismiss your insight so quickly.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.369
You're the only one
in that room

13:25.413 --> 13:27.415
who actually knows
our Mr. Freemont.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.678
In my book, that makes you
the only real expert.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.593
Ooh. Keep talkin'.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.290
Well, if you're not in a rush
to get back to Quantico,

13:33.334 --> 13:35.075
how would you like to ride
with me the rest of my shift,

13:35.118 --> 13:36.380
help us find our suspect?

13:39.427 --> 13:40.863
I'd love to.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.038
This way.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.737
Simone: How long you been
on the job?

13:45.781 --> 13:47.087
Nolan:
Only a couple years.

13:47.130 --> 13:50.307
I was just the oldest rookie
in the LAPD.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.179
What? That's funny

13:52.222 --> 13:55.791
because I'm the oldest trainee
at the Academy.

13:55.835 --> 13:59.012
So, why'd you change course
and sign up?

13:59.055 --> 14:01.753
Found myself in the middle
of a bank robbery.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.277
What?
Helping the people
on the inside

14:03.320 --> 14:04.756
made me want to do
more of it.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.367
What about yourself?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.673
I've always wanted to be
an FBI agent,

14:08.717 --> 14:11.111
but I ended up on an off-ramp
when I found out

14:11.154 --> 14:13.069
I was pregnant
with the twins.

14:13.113 --> 14:17.552
They in college now, so time for
Mama to finish what she started.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.945
It's not easy, though,
trying to keep up

14:18.988 --> 14:20.511
with these 20-somethings.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.861
Sheesh.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.167
Every day, I am determined
to beat them,

14:24.211 --> 14:27.170
and every night, I crawl into
bed feeling beaten.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.000
Can I offer you
some hard-won advice?

14:31.044 --> 14:32.697
Please.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.786
You are never gonna beat them
at being 20-something.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.397
But what you lack
in flexibility

14:36.440 --> 14:38.225
or the ability to run up
a flight of stairs

14:38.268 --> 14:39.879
without getting winded...

14:39.922 --> 14:43.012
...you more than make up for
in life experience.

14:43.056 --> 14:46.015
And that puts you way ahead of
the curve, day one on the job.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.541
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

14:50.585 --> 14:51.978
Anytime.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.026
Alright.

14:57.070 --> 15:00.160
This is the closest tunnel
to Zeke's apartment.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.249
- I'll go check it out.
- I'mma come with you.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.077
No, it's not safe.
You're not even armed.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.861
I'm telling you,
I know this kid.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.689
He's not
a violent person.

15:07.732 --> 15:09.952
And the bomb that nearly
killed me says differently.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.475
Well --
Stay here.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.296
7-Adam-15, I have eyes
on our bombing suspect.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.819
Heading east
toward King Street.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.604
Zeke. Zeke!

16:05.703 --> 16:07.009
Don't even think
about it.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.663
I got him.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.014
Did you just steal
my police vehicle?

16:12.058 --> 16:15.148
No. I borrowed it
to catch a fleeing suspect.

16:15.191 --> 16:16.845
You're welcome.

16:16.888 --> 16:19.413
Miss Clark, is that you?

16:19.456 --> 16:21.502
Yes, honey.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.330
Please don't let that man
kill me.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.594
What man?

17:18.385 --> 17:21.301
Simone: I know that look.
He's overloaded, shuttin' down.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.043
If he wasn't handcuffed to
that table, he'd be under it.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.784
Shouldn't you be on a plane
to Virginia?

17:26.828 --> 17:29.787
Oh, that's my fault.
I asked her to stay.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.920
W-Without Simone, we wouldn't
have our suspect in custody.

17:31.963 --> 17:33.487
Well, I'm glad
that she was of service.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.271
But tell me something, Trainee,
in the Bureau,

17:35.315 --> 17:36.838
what are you taught to do
when given an order?

17:36.881 --> 17:38.883
Follow it, sir,
to the letter.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.669
Matt, considering her
relationship with the suspect,

17:41.712 --> 17:43.888
we were thinking that she should
take point on the interview.

17:43.932 --> 17:45.760
Absolutely not.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.718
She's a NAT, nowhere even close
to being qualified.

17:47.762 --> 17:50.939
Garza: Agent Fox is right. We'll
conduct the interview ourselves.

17:50.982 --> 17:54.073
Get yourself back to Quantico
now, while you can.

17:55.944 --> 17:58.468
Mr. Freemont...

17:58.512 --> 18:00.122
<i>we're with the FBI.</i>

18:00.166 --> 18:02.255
<i>You are in a lot of trouble.</i>

18:02.298 --> 18:04.822
Nolan:
I'll, um, walk you out.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.348
If you need any recommendations
on places to eat

18:08.391 --> 18:09.827
before your flight...

18:09.871 --> 18:12.003
Thanks, but I know
all the good spots.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.528
At least, I used to.
I grew up here.

18:14.571 --> 18:17.139
Really? Any family you want
to see before you leave?

18:17.183 --> 18:20.099
None that wants to see <i>me.</i>

18:20.142 --> 18:21.926
Fox:
Trainee, hold up!

18:21.970 --> 18:23.450
Suspect says
he'll only talk to you.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.543
Can we lose
the shackles?

18:29.586 --> 18:30.718
Yes, of course.

18:30.761 --> 18:32.459
Hey, Zeke.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.983
It's me --
Miss Clark.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.724
<i>Remember to breathe,</i> <i>
okay?</i>

18:39.205 --> 18:43.383
When I first met Zeke, he was
really struggling in school.

18:43.426 --> 18:46.821
Every day, he was either
acting out,

18:46.864 --> 18:49.563
freaking out,
or zoning out.

18:49.606 --> 18:51.913
But then we spent
some time together,

18:51.956 --> 18:54.263
and I realized he just needed
help transitioning

18:54.307 --> 18:56.047
from the chaos at home.

18:56.091 --> 18:59.529
So I told him to come
in my office every morning.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.227
And what did you say?

19:03.620 --> 19:05.100
That I didn't wanna talk.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.362
<i>Mm-hmm, that's right.</i>

19:06.406 --> 19:07.972
And I told him
he didn't have to.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.018
He could use that time
to get quiet.

19:10.061 --> 19:12.499
And that's what we did.

19:12.542 --> 19:15.676
Every day for two years,
he would come to my office,

19:15.719 --> 19:19.984
sit for 15 minutes,
then go to class.

19:20.028 --> 19:23.118
And who became
an "A" student?

19:23.162 --> 19:26.208
Yeah, after a few weeks,
she bought me an MP3 player

19:26.252 --> 19:28.863
and some headphones so I could
listen to music in the morning.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.212
Mm-hmm.

19:32.606 --> 19:34.216
I'm in real trouble, huh?

19:34.260 --> 19:37.132
I'm afraid you are.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.483
What can you tell us about the
man with the scar on his face?

19:40.527 --> 19:43.225
I don't know who he is,
I swear.

19:43.269 --> 19:46.054
I needed money, so I've been
selling my engineering skills

19:46.097 --> 19:47.273
on the dark web.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.665
He paid you to build a bomb
for him?

19:48.709 --> 19:49.710
No,
just the detonators.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.191
Detonators?

19:52.234 --> 19:55.368
As in, more than one?

19:55.411 --> 19:59.241
I made him six,
along with a regular timer

19:59.285 --> 20:01.025
and five with GPS triggers.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.288
T-Those are special.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.638
I-I-I built them
so they'd go off

20:04.681 --> 20:06.857
when they reach a programmed set
of coordinates.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.032
And what were
the coordinates?

20:08.076 --> 20:09.469
Oh, he didn't tell me.

20:09.512 --> 20:11.819
I-I-I gave him
the instructions

20:11.862 --> 20:13.690
on how to program them in himself.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.779
You knowingly helped
a terrorist?

20:15.823 --> 20:17.433
He said he was
a research scientist

20:17.477 --> 20:19.348
and that it was for a project
that he was working on.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.264
I-I-I knew
it didn't sound right,

20:22.308 --> 20:23.439
but I was desperate
for money.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.572
And about the time I got
to the exchange,

20:25.615 --> 20:27.400
I realized I made a mistake,
but it was too late.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.837
He grabbed the detonators
and tried to shoot me.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.447
I ran away and hid.

20:31.491 --> 20:34.233
Zeke, is there anything else you
can tell us about this man?

20:34.276 --> 20:36.147
His name,
the kind of car he drives?

20:36.191 --> 20:37.975
I told you everything I know, man.

20:41.457 --> 20:43.807
<i>I'm sorry I let you down,</i> <i>
Miss Clark.</i>

20:50.597 --> 20:53.817
That is a very troubled
young man.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.428
You really believe he didn't
know he was making detonators

20:55.471 --> 20:58.126
for bombs?
I don't know.

20:58.169 --> 21:01.303
For such a smart kid,
he could sometimes act a fool.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.827
Now he's looking
at a lifetime of incarceration

21:03.871 --> 21:05.655
due to federal
mandatory minimums.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.527
I gotta get
this kid a lawyer.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.181
Uh, do you really think
that's a good idea?

21:10.225 --> 21:11.705
That's not gonna make you
any friends at the Bureau.

21:11.748 --> 21:14.316
I know, but Zeke's
one of my kids.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.753
I told my students
on day one,

21:16.797 --> 21:20.757
"Miss Clark will always have
your back, no matter what."

21:20.801 --> 21:23.760
That's not gonna stop
just 'cause he graduated.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.284
Is there anything
I can do to help?

21:25.327 --> 21:27.329
I appreciate that,
but I know somebody

21:27.373 --> 21:29.984
I can go to
about this.

21:30.027 --> 21:32.160
It was a pleasure
working with you, John.

21:32.203 --> 21:34.684
Wish I could stick around
to help you catch the guy.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.251
Me too.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.819
And, Simone,
don't let them get you down.

21:38.862 --> 21:40.037
You're the real thing.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.216
Lopez: Professor "Alien"
called again.

21:45.260 --> 21:48.307
He wants an update on
the Heptapod who stole his book.

21:48.350 --> 21:49.830
Well, according
to his colleagues,

21:49.873 --> 21:51.527
he was actually telling
the truth about one thing.

21:51.571 --> 21:54.574
He is the foremost expert
on urban planning.

21:54.617 --> 21:58.839
Unfortunately, he also pioneered
LSD micro-dosing.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.623
And accidentally fried
his brain?

22:00.667 --> 22:03.713
Yeah. He has been having
hallucinations ever since.

22:06.803 --> 22:09.371
Hello?

22:09.415 --> 22:12.374
Professor Meadows, we were just
discussing your case.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.377
Hold on.
Let me put you on speaker.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.423
Professor Meadows: <i>
And I just remembered something</i> <i>
about the break-in.</i>

22:17.466 --> 22:19.729
<i>When the alien fled,</i> <i>
I looked out the window</i>

22:19.773 --> 22:22.993
<i>and saw him jump</i> <i>
into a red flying saucer.</i>

22:23.037 --> 22:26.040
<i>Oh, it was more of an oval</i> <i>
now that I think about it.</i>

22:26.083 --> 22:28.912
Okay, got it. If you remember
anything else, let us know.

22:28.956 --> 22:32.568
So, should I put out a BOLO
for a red spaceship?

22:32.612 --> 22:35.441
No, but if we assume
that the attack is real,

22:35.484 --> 22:37.530
then it's possible
what he saw was a red car.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.706
So we should start pulling
traffic-cam footage.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.970
No problem. There's only about a
million red cars in Los Angeles.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.363
Hey, Grey wants
all hands on deck.

22:44.406 --> 22:46.408
Oh, thank God.

22:46.452 --> 22:50.020
Come on, people, can't rely on
the feds to solve this for us.

22:50.064 --> 22:53.284
Well, Zeke said he made
six detonators for our bomber.

22:53.328 --> 22:54.938
The first one,
a countdown timer that was used

22:54.982 --> 22:57.767
at the relay station,
and the other five GPS-enabled.

22:57.811 --> 22:59.465
If only we had an idea
what the targets are.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.075
Hey, maybe we could
extrapolate them

23:01.118 --> 23:02.816
from the first target,
the power station.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.644
There's got to be a reason
he hit that thing first.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.081
Not because he wanted
to hurt people.

23:07.124 --> 23:09.126
He only knocked out the power
to a big chunk of the Valley.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.696
What if
that was the point?

23:13.740 --> 23:16.438
What if he wanted to, uh,
get something or do something

23:16.482 --> 23:20.268
that he didn't have access to
unless the power was off?

23:20.311 --> 23:21.487
There's at least
a dozen banks.

23:21.530 --> 23:23.358
Jewelry stores,
a check-cashing place.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.664
I mean, there's no
high-value targets here.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.796
Nothing that is
a terrorist's wet dream.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.233
National Guard Armory.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.714
That --
That's gotta be it.

23:31.758 --> 23:33.934
And there are enough weapons
there for an entire platoon.

23:33.977 --> 23:37.328
And enough explosive munitions
to take out a hundred targets.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.559
Dobbs: I'm sorry, but the
armory's in lockdown right now.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.998
I'm the one who called you earlier...

23:55.042 --> 23:56.435
about your husband.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.742
Is Brady okay?

23:59.786 --> 24:02.223
For now.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.007
And so long as you do
as you promised,

24:04.051 --> 24:05.705
you'll see him tonight.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.184
Now, let's get to work.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.364
Tim: Control, 7-Adam-100,
be advised Adam-15,

24:13.408 --> 24:14.844
Adam-4, Adam-22, and us
are Code 3

24:14.888 --> 24:16.280
to the National Guard Armory

24:16.324 --> 24:17.760
for a possible 459
in progress.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.109
Will advise.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.154
Bailey,
we're three minutes out.

24:20.197 --> 24:21.895
Any sign
of our terror suspect?

24:21.938 --> 24:24.811
Not yet, but the armorer chief
isn't answering his radio.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.558
We're entering the cage.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.565

Got a man down!

24:41.436 --> 24:43.394
John, he's here.
Or he was.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.441
Stay with him.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.921
Everyone, on me.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.317

Russian -- at least, his accent.
Scar on his face.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.177
What did he steal
from my armory?

28:21.221 --> 28:24.093
200 kilos
of C-4 explosives.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.754
Now, nobody asked you
to cook.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.756

Bup-bup-bup-bup.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.514
Don't even come over here
reaching in these pots.

Mama's recipe,
Mama's rules.

about your mother...

29:01.391 --> 29:03.785
except her damn rules.

29:05.656 --> 29:08.834
You would always rope me in
as your accomplice

29:08.877 --> 29:11.662
to break every single
last one of them.

29:11.706 --> 29:14.230
We drove Mama crazy
with our foolishness.

29:14.274 --> 29:16.102
Yeah.

29:19.061 --> 29:22.369
We used to be
so close, Daddy.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.893
Well, that's on you.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.809
Joining the feds,
after everything I went through

29:27.853 --> 29:29.419
at the hands
of law enforcement --

29:29.463 --> 29:31.900
Everything <i>
we</i> went through.

29:31.944 --> 29:35.686
Really? Because I was
the one incarcerated

29:35.730 --> 29:38.080
for a crime
I didn't commit,

29:38.124 --> 29:40.691
away from you,
your mother.

29:40.735 --> 29:43.390
Which is why I'll find
a lawyer

29:43.433 --> 29:45.131
for your student
who is in trouble.

29:45.174 --> 29:49.396
But, Simone, you are on
the wrong side of this trouble.

29:49.439 --> 29:52.791
It was an FBI investigation
that got you exonerated.

29:52.834 --> 29:57.491
And it was FBI investigations
that tried to compromise Martin,

29:57.534 --> 30:00.755
Malcolm, Angela,
Black Lives Matter.

30:00.799 --> 30:04.498
Daddy, a good agent can make
more positive change

30:04.541 --> 30:07.283
with one case than most people
do in a lifetime.

30:07.327 --> 30:10.721
Oh, what's that?
Quote for the yearbook?

30:10.765 --> 30:14.073
Come on, give me a real reason
why you are doing this.

30:14.116 --> 30:17.293
Because we make up
less than 1%.

30:17.337 --> 30:21.123
Black women make up
less than 1% of the FBI.

30:21.167 --> 30:24.039
Speeches at rallies
only do so much.

30:24.083 --> 30:28.783
If we want real justice,
we need a voice on the inside.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.524
You just don't get it.

30:30.567 --> 30:34.180
Once you're in the FBI,
they'll change you.

30:37.183 --> 30:39.489
Well,
we will never know.

30:39.533 --> 30:43.363
'Cause I am about that close
to being kicked out.

30:46.148 --> 30:47.846
For what?

30:47.889 --> 30:50.892
Well, apparently, there two ways
of doing things --

30:50.936 --> 30:53.503
the FBI way
and the wrong way.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.202
And guess which one
I'm excelling in.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.638
So I'm screwed.

30:57.681 --> 31:00.032
Not according to
Miles Davis.

31:00.075 --> 31:03.383
He said, "When you hit
a wrong note,

31:03.426 --> 31:06.908
it's the next note
that makes it good or bad."

31:06.952 --> 31:08.867
They haven't
kicked you out yet.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.086
So what happens next
is on you.

31:11.130 --> 31:13.132
It's great advice, Daddy,

31:13.175 --> 31:15.917
but I thought you said you
didn't want me to be in the FBI.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.180
No, I don't.

31:18.224 --> 31:23.403
But nobody tells my baby girl
that she doesn't belong.

31:28.712 --> 31:31.367
Wow. The FBI doesn't really do
moderation, do they?

31:31.411 --> 31:33.674
Seriously, it's like
a spaceship.

31:33.717 --> 31:36.720
- Get any sleep?
- No, but, uh, Sleeping Beauty here

31:36.764 --> 31:38.157
got an hour
in the back of the shop.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.636
Sergeant's stripes
come with privileges.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.942
Don't be jealous.

31:40.986 --> 31:43.814
Okay, people, listen up.
Garza has an update.

31:43.858 --> 31:45.425
Garza:
It's a whole new ballgame.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.122
The amount of explosives stolen
sent shock waves

31:47.166 --> 31:48.863
through D.C. overnight.

31:48.907 --> 31:51.431
Homeland Security is now getting
involved, as is ATF,

31:51.474 --> 31:53.955
which means this is no longer
a joint task force.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.652
It's wholly federal now.

31:55.696 --> 31:58.090
All due respect, LAPD has busted
their ass in this case.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.656
Hey, I get it.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.745
I do,
but my hands are tied.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.400
A terrorist got away with
over 200 kilos of C-4,

32:04.444 --> 32:06.402
so that kind of changes
the complexion of things.

32:06.446 --> 32:08.970
Are you blaming my guys
- for that?
- Did I say that, Wade?

32:09.014 --> 32:11.277
Oh, no, uh,
we're all a little tired,

32:11.320 --> 32:14.106
but I think we can remember
we're all on the same team here.

32:14.149 --> 32:16.456
You're not talking
to security guards, Matt.

32:16.499 --> 32:18.980
We've investigators, and we're
not gonna stop hunting this guy

32:19.024 --> 32:20.590
because you tell us to.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.853
Can we talk about this
in private, please?

32:22.897 --> 32:25.291
You're damn straight.

32:25.334 --> 32:27.641
My office.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.646
I got a problem.
Me too.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.256
I've been scrubbing traffic-cam
footage for hours,

32:34.300 --> 32:36.084
hunting for
an extraterrestrial.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.391
No, no, I'm serious.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.088
What is it?
The baby?

32:40.132 --> 32:42.047
No.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.963
TID pulled partial prints
from the professor's rear door.

32:45.006 --> 32:47.269
You know, the one that
the aliens jimmied open?

32:47.313 --> 32:48.705
That's not a problem.
That's great.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.098
It has to belong
to the attacker.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.231
Exactly.
So I ran the prints,

32:52.274 --> 32:54.189
and they came back
as classified.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.670
What?
Yeah, so,
I called my friend

32:56.713 --> 32:59.455
over at the DEA
who has top-secret clearance,

32:59.499 --> 33:01.240
and I asked her to run
the prints,

33:01.283 --> 33:03.633
and she was denied
access, too.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.505
Who the hell
is our suspect?

33:05.548 --> 33:08.203
I don't know,
but the classified designation

33:08.247 --> 33:11.772
for our suspect
originated from...

33:11.815 --> 33:16.342
the Air Force base
at Groom Lake.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.083
Okay,
your vocal inflection

33:18.126 --> 33:19.345
leads me to believe
that's a big deal,

33:19.388 --> 33:21.129
but for the life of me,
I don't know why.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.044
How do you not know
about Groom Lake?

33:23.088 --> 33:25.612
Paradise Ranch?
Dreamland?

33:25.655 --> 33:28.397
Also known as Area 51.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.747
Isn't that where the government
supposedly keeps the --

33:30.791 --> 33:33.750
Aliens? Yeah.

33:40.322 --> 33:43.108
Sgt. Grey:
You think I'm pissed off because
you hurt our feelings?

33:43.151 --> 33:45.284
We don't care... What the hell
are you still doing here?

33:45.327 --> 33:47.634
Oh, I just need five minutes
with Agent Garza.

33:47.677 --> 33:49.592
You're supposed to be back
at Quantico.

33:49.636 --> 33:51.942
You and I both know that as soon
as I get back to the Academy,

33:51.986 --> 33:53.727
they gonna find
a reason to fire me.

33:53.770 --> 33:56.121
Here is the only place
I can prove I belong.

33:56.164 --> 33:58.949
You're still a trainee.
It's not gonna happen.

33:58.993 --> 34:01.691
Can you honestly say that
all my contributions

34:01.735 --> 34:03.215
haven't earned me a place
on this task force?

34:03.258 --> 34:04.912
Absolutely.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.828
A NAT who can't follow orders
has no place in the FBI.

34:07.871 --> 34:11.266
Okay. Look...my father
was incarcerated

34:11.310 --> 34:12.963
for a crime
he didn't commit.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.183
I know.
I read your file.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.533
Okay, w-well,
here's what's not in it.

34:17.577 --> 34:20.406
My father was
an amazing trumpet player.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.147
He was a jazz prodigy.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.323
After eight years
in prison,

34:24.366 --> 34:26.412
never picked up
his horn again.

34:26.455 --> 34:28.109
He let the system steal
that from him.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.545
He didn't even put up
a fight.

34:29.589 --> 34:32.287
He gave up on his music,
his dreams, all of it.

34:32.331 --> 34:35.029
But let me guess.
It's not gonna be you.

34:35.073 --> 34:39.381
Look at you,
finally starting to get me.

34:39.425 --> 34:40.991
Let me tell you
what I wish someone told me

34:41.035 --> 34:44.386
when I was a blue flamer,
trying to prove myself.

34:44.430 --> 34:47.346
The FBI isn't a safe space
for women's empowerment.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.217
It's a boys' club.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.611
Now, you still have
a chance to make it.

34:51.654 --> 34:54.179
All you have to do is fit in
by hiding who you really are.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.355
Honey, there's
no hiding this.

34:56.398 --> 34:59.184
Simone, I'm trying
to help you.

34:59.227 --> 35:02.752
I know, Casey --
Agent Fox.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.190
A-And I'm sorry for whatever
you had to put up with

35:05.233 --> 35:06.930
to do this job.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.889
But the one thing I learned
in this life

35:08.932 --> 35:10.891
is to be true
to who I am.

35:10.934 --> 35:14.373
So I'm waiting right here
for Agent Garza.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.418
Okay.

35:16.462 --> 35:17.898
Lopez:
Here's what we're gonna do.

35:17.941 --> 35:19.552
I'm gonna call a professional...

35:19.595 --> 35:20.640
...someone you could talk to
about all of this.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.642
But you're working
with the aliens.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.862
No, Professor, we are the ones
who are trying to help you.

35:25.906 --> 35:28.822
We believe that your attacker
is or was in the military.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.433
Yes,
the galactic alien army.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.610
Okay, okay, maybe your attacker
was an alien.

35:34.654 --> 35:38.440
The truth finally prevails
with you conniving WIBs.

35:38.484 --> 35:40.094
WIBs?

35:40.138 --> 35:41.574
Simone: Women in Black.

35:43.532 --> 35:47.188
Hi, y'all.
I'm Simone with the FBI.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.277
Can I speak to you two
for a hot sec?

35:53.716 --> 35:57.285
Hey, I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job,

35:57.329 --> 35:59.896
but that man is having
a clinical delusion.

35:59.940 --> 36:03.683
He's unable to process logic,
so you challenging him

36:03.726 --> 36:06.555
is only pushing him further
towards his beliefs.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.384
And you playing along
is just making him think

36:09.428 --> 36:11.386
his delusions are real.

36:11.430 --> 36:14.172
Are you a psychiatrist or...

36:14.215 --> 36:15.738
I was
a guidance counselor.

36:15.782 --> 36:18.611
I worked with kids
experiencing everything

36:18.654 --> 36:21.788
from schizoaffective disorder
to severe horniness.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.659
So, you think you can
get through to him

36:23.703 --> 36:25.095
in a way that we can't?

36:25.139 --> 36:27.446
I think I can charm
and disarm him,

36:27.489 --> 36:29.491
and it might bring him back
to reality.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.798
We could definitely use
some more reality.

36:31.841 --> 36:33.365
Give it a try.

36:33.408 --> 36:37.934
Simone: Hello, sir.
I am not a Woman in Black.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.067
See?
I'm wearing brown and tan.

36:40.110 --> 36:42.504
It's cute, right?

36:42.548 --> 36:45.899
Mind if we go somewhere
where we could talk?

36:45.942 --> 36:48.945
When I was a little girl,
I used to go out in the yard

36:48.989 --> 36:50.904
and look for UFOs.

36:50.947 --> 36:53.602
And then, one night,
they found me.

36:53.646 --> 36:54.951
Extraterrestrials?

36:54.995 --> 36:57.476
Well, no,
a family of possums

36:57.519 --> 37:00.218
rooting around
in our trash cans.

37:00.261 --> 37:01.741
I thought
they were ETs.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.265
Have you ever seen
one of those things up close?

37:04.309 --> 37:06.528
It's otherworldly.

37:06.572 --> 37:10.228
But I never stopped believing
that it was possible

37:10.271 --> 37:11.838
we're not alone
in the universe.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.796
We're not.

37:13.840 --> 37:18.236
I was attacked by a Heptapod who
smelled of chocolate and blood.

37:18.279 --> 37:22.892
Okay, see, now, Professor,
that makes me wonder

37:22.936 --> 37:28.681
why you're the only person
who saw this bizarre creature.

37:28.724 --> 37:31.597
Because he's a shape-shifter
who can take on many forms.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.990
Okay. Like what?

37:34.034 --> 37:37.255
A white man in his 30s.

37:37.298 --> 37:39.561
Okay, what else can you tell me
about him,

37:39.605 --> 37:41.911
when he was a white man
in his 30s?

37:41.955 --> 37:44.218
He spoke Russian.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.567
Well, at least,
he had an accent.

37:45.611 --> 37:46.873
It's hard to remember.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.788
W-Well, Professor,

37:48.831 --> 37:52.879
did the man have a scar
on the left side of his face?

37:52.922 --> 37:54.184
You've seen him, too.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.534
I'll be right back.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.015
Do you have
a task force BOLO?

37:59.059 --> 38:00.278
I can pull it up
on my phone.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.978
Professor...
is this the man

38:05.021 --> 38:07.807
that attacked you
inside your home?

38:07.850 --> 38:09.678
Yes! That's him.

38:14.596 --> 38:17.077
Okay, everybody, our suspect
is renting a house

38:17.120 --> 38:18.426
in Lincoln Heights under
the name Trevor Gurin.

38:18.470 --> 38:19.862
We tracked him there through
traffic-cam footage

38:19.906 --> 38:21.168
from his origin point
at the professor's house.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.691
That's great work, detectives.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.084
Actually, Simone deserves
the credit.

38:24.127 --> 38:25.564
She's the one who put it
all together.

38:29.002 --> 38:30.351
Good work.

38:30.395 --> 38:31.613
Thank you, sir.
I just --

38:31.657 --> 38:33.528
Mobilize additional agents
and HRT.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.008
And notify Homeland
and ATF.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.618
So, you two on me.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.359
Get schematics for the house,
send them to my box.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.143
I'll put in
- for a telephonic warrant.
- Alright.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.243
Garza: So, you think I should
put you on the task force?

38:56.290 --> 38:59.380
Honestly, only a fool
would keep me off it.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.382
Are you calling me
a fool?

39:01.426 --> 39:03.906
Are you putting me
on the task force?

39:06.431 --> 39:09.259
Yeah.

39:09.303 --> 39:10.783
You're riding with me.
Let's go.

39:12.437 --> 39:13.873
Yes!

39:16.266 --> 39:18.007
Officer #1: Go, go, go!

39:18.051 --> 39:20.270
Officer #2:
Secure the perimeter.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.576
Nolan:
We got a body!

39:21.620 --> 39:22.795
Is it our suspect?

39:22.838 --> 39:25.754
No, the abducted husband.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.843
Given how cold he is, I'd say
Gurin killed him last night

39:27.887 --> 39:30.106
when he got back
from stealing the explosives.

39:30.150 --> 39:31.673
House is clear.
For all we know,

39:31.717 --> 39:33.675
this guy's pulling off
his next attacks as we speak.

39:33.719 --> 39:35.460
So let's tear this place apart.
We're looking for anything

39:35.503 --> 39:37.505
that might indicate
our unsub's targets.

39:37.549 --> 39:40.508
Man: <i>All units, be advised</i> <i>
suspect still at large.</i>

39:40.552 --> 39:43.337
<i>Male Caucasian,</i> <i>
armed and dangerous.</i>

39:43.381 --> 39:45.295
Hey,
I-I think this is a map.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.036
It has to have been
of L.A.,

39:47.080 --> 39:48.647
and there were
other pins in it.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.300
If we could
find the publisher,

39:50.344 --> 39:52.825
maybe we could match
the pinholes with locations?

39:52.868 --> 39:54.609
Yeah. On it.
We got a whole department

39:54.653 --> 39:56.829
of eggheads who love solving
these kinds of puzzles.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.134
You got something?

39:58.178 --> 39:59.571
There's no mattress
in there.

39:59.614 --> 40:01.660
This guy was just sleeping
on a hard-ass floor.

40:01.703 --> 40:02.965
Alright, so, what do you think
it means?

40:03.009 --> 40:04.750
He's punishing himself.

40:04.793 --> 40:07.013
Nothing soft, nothing warm,
no creature comforts.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.884
Military man, maybe?

40:08.928 --> 40:10.495
Used to sleeping on the ground?
Finds a bed too soft?

40:10.538 --> 40:12.453
Or maybe too indulgent.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.455
So, what's a better way
to stay focused on the mission

40:14.499 --> 40:15.891
than to take away
every small pleasure?

40:15.935 --> 40:17.153
Sure, that tracks.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.285
What I can't
wrap my mind around

40:18.328 --> 40:20.374
is the connection
to Area 51.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.854
Why would they classify
his fingerprints?

40:21.897 --> 40:25.727
You know, stories about aliens
at Area 51 were only a cover

40:25.771 --> 40:27.599
that they were doing
covert operations there.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.035
So, what are we saying?

40:29.078 --> 40:32.299
Our suspect had ties
to classified U.S. operations?

40:32.342 --> 40:33.518
Geez, what a nightmare
that would be.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.302
Chen found something.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.522
Uh, I figured he would write
on the map,

40:37.565 --> 40:38.740
so I did a wall rubbing.

40:38.784 --> 40:39.959
Uh, I found a word.

40:40.002 --> 40:43.005
It's faint,
but I think it says "Enervo."

40:43.049 --> 40:45.965
- What does that mean?
- It's Latin. It means "to deprive of power."

40:46.008 --> 40:48.010
Yeah, I worked with a lot of CIA
guys in Afghanistan,

40:48.054 --> 40:49.447
and Enervo is just the type

40:49.490 --> 40:51.187
of pretentious code name
they'd give an op.

40:51.231 --> 40:52.885
"Deprive of power"
is exactly

40:52.928 --> 40:54.321
what he was doing
with the first bombing.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.236
You think he'd go after
more relay stations?

40:56.279 --> 40:59.500
No. In a ground war, what's
the military's first target?

40:59.544 --> 41:00.936
Take out the enemy's
infrastructure.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.460
Power, water --
Roads.

41:03.417 --> 41:06.376
That's why he stole the
professor's book on traffic.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.814
Quickest way to cripple this
city -- take out the freeways.

41:24.307 --> 41:27.485
Hello.
I'm Professor Meadows.

41:27.528 --> 41:29.530
I'm so pleased you all agreed
to help me

41:29.574 --> 41:31.097
with my little
research project

41:31.140 --> 41:33.665
on traffic patterns
in Los Angeles.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.623
Inside the envelope,
you'll find your first payment

41:35.667 --> 41:38.757
and your precise driving route
for the day.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.585
It's vital

41:40.628 --> 41:43.065
that you follow the exact
directions in your envelope.

41:43.109 --> 41:46.112
Otherwise, you won't get
your delivery payment.

41:47.766 --> 41:50.508
Excellent.
Then get going.

41:50.551 --> 41:52.510
And remember -- drive safe.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.557
Alright,
let's get going.
