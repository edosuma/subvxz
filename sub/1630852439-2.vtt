00:07.716 --> 00:10.218
A thousand years after the Breaking,

00:11.303 --> 00:14.682
battles still raged against
the forces of the Dark One.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.358
With the towers of Manetheren
to their backs,

00:24.442 --> 00:27.277
King Aemon and his army
defended their people.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.033
Battling through unrelenting
days and nights,

00:34.118 --> 00:38.456
they held their city against trollocs,
darkfriends and dreadlords,

00:38.539 --> 00:41.792
until they could no longer
hold the river from crossing.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.176
Behind the honor of the Red Eagle banner,

00:50.259 --> 00:52.677
retreat found no place amongst them.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.546
And the sword that could not be broken...

01:29.507 --> 01:31.174
was shattered.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.188
From behind the walls of the emptied city,

01:45.772 --> 01:48.901
Queen Eldrene sank
with King Aemon's death.

01:51.820 --> 01:56.325
And so her heart and kingdom
found their end.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.766
And today, in the Two Rivers,
where Manetheren once stood,

02:24.853 --> 02:26.980
the Wheel continues to turn.
