WEBVTT

00:06.924 --> 00:09.962
Gentlemen,
we are about to embark.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.420
Come on!

00:13.555 --> 00:16.093
I wanted to say something
all profound for posterity.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.636
Save it, "Hobbit" Oppenheimer.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.805
We don't even know
if it worked this time.

00:19.937 --> 00:20.895
Well?

00:20.896 --> 00:22.558
Seems like a apple.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.689
Take a bite.

00:23.774 --> 00:24.810
Uh, y-you.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.308
I'm gonna run diagnostics,

00:26.443 --> 00:28.560
make sure the genetic sequence
isn't compromised.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.106
Yeah, make sure
there aren't any,

00:30.239 --> 00:31.571
you know,
fly parts it in.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.486
Seriously, double
and triple fly-check.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.280
Diagnostics look clean.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.663
- Hmm.
- Well?

00:41.792 --> 00:44.830
It tastes like success!

00:44.962 --> 00:45.962
Yes!

00:46.046 --> 00:49.039
So who's gonna volunteer
to be our first human subject?

00:49.174 --> 00:51.632
Whoa, what? Yeah, look, no way.
You're crazy.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.440
We're nowhere near ready
for human testing.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.928
White, go find Hank.
He'd do it for the free apple.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.342
Doc, no!

00:57.474 --> 01:00.262
This is literally the first
apple we haven't massacred.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.727
We need to study it,
repeat the experiment,

01:02.854 --> 01:05.312
analyze and reanalyze
all the data

01:05.440 --> 01:09.059
and then, <i>maybe</i>, in a couple
of months, move up to mice.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.230
Ahoy, chairmen!

01:10.362 --> 01:11.648
If'n you're done fiddling

01:11.780 --> 01:13.988
with your fancy
food processor,

01:14.116 --> 01:16.358
we need your signature
on these here...

01:16.493 --> 01:18.325
Aah!

01:18.453 --> 01:21.036
Not ready
for human testing.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.996
Congratulations, Captain!

01:23.125 --> 01:26.539
You've just made
super science history!

01:26.670 --> 01:28.957
Now, right this way, Captain.
Billy's just gonna...

01:29.089 --> 01:30.089
He's done it!

01:30.173 --> 01:33.712
Repeat, Venture has done it!
We are go for extraction.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.176
Huh?
What the...

01:43.312 --> 01:45.429
Mayday! Mayday!
I've been spotted.

01:45.564 --> 01:46.850
Initiating evasive...

01:51.445 --> 01:54.188
No! No way!
Absolutely...

01:54.323 --> 01:56.861
I am not joining
some dumb team.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.403
You're not joining a team.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.697
You're just filling in
for one job.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.116
I had to pull a lot of strings
to get you this gig.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.241
Well, unpull them, then.
Push them back! Whatever!

02:06.376 --> 02:07.662
I don't want it!

02:07.794 --> 02:09.330
No, but you need it!

02:09.463 --> 02:11.204
The Guild wants this thing
so bad,

02:11.340 --> 02:13.548
they're offering
a full EMA level upgrade

02:13.675 --> 02:14.694
if the heist is successful.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.756
A heist? Sweet!
What's the score?

02:17.888 --> 02:19.254
Classified, Gary.
I'm sorry.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.301
It doesn't matter
because I'm not inter...

02:21.433 --> 02:23.720
Don't you dare put that
empty milk carton back!

02:23.852 --> 02:25.593
There's still some left!
It's a sip.

02:25.729 --> 02:29.063
A sip? <i>A</i> sip?
Go get more milk.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.934
Look, I'm just not
a team player, okay, honey?

02:32.069 --> 02:34.561
The Monarch is
strictly a solo act!

02:34.696 --> 02:36.187
Yes, I know, sweetness.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.781
You're a precious unicorn,
beautiful and unique,

02:38.909 --> 02:41.117
but can you at least just go
and meet with them

02:41.244 --> 02:45.033
before you make up your mind,
please, for me?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.370
Hi-o, guy-o!

02:52.506 --> 02:54.668
Glad you could come
on such short notice.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.258
Sashay on in here.
The meeting's started.

02:57.386 --> 03:00.595
Well, hey, all.
Look at what the me dragged in.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.931
Team, this here's Tiny Eagle's
replacement, the Mighty Monarch.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.096
Mighty Monarch,
meet the team.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.096
Dot Com,
hackstress extraordinaire.

03:09.231 --> 03:10.147
Hey.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.435
And to her lovely left
is Tunnel Vision,

03:12.567 --> 03:13.567
our resident digger.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.610
Hey there, chief.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.191
That funny-looking fella
is called Presto Change-O.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.359
Greetings!

03:19.491 --> 03:21.778
And over here
you've got Ramburglar,

03:21.910 --> 03:23.401
top-shelf smash-and-grab man.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.328
'Sup?

03:24.329 --> 03:26.286
Lastly, there's Driver X.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.701
Ooh, he ain't much for words,

03:27.833 --> 03:31.577
but his getaway driving's
poetry in motion.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.873
Hey.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.121
So, uh, I'm a little late
to this party, and my wi...

03:35.257 --> 03:38.250
the councilwoman, uh,
was kind of hazy on the details.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.923
Uh, what exactly is the job?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.797
Oh, you're in for a treat,
june bug.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.141
We're fixing to hit that there
Venture headquarters.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.556
Listen, Doc,
I really need to talk to you

03:49.688 --> 03:51.145
about this security breach.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.559
Oh, pfft, later.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.460
I want to get right to work
on my press release.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.004
I mean,
this is it, Brock.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.898
Telepor-freaking-tation.

03:58.029 --> 03:58.988
Can you believe it?

03:58.989 --> 04:01.447
Oh, this is
the kind of game-changer

04:01.575 --> 04:03.316
I've been working for
my entire life.

04:03.452 --> 04:06.945
Yeah, uh, got to make
a quick stop.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.415
Huh, didn't know we had tenants
on this floor.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.580
Or even this floor.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.578
Welcome back, Mr. Samson.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.875
Ohh.
Who's your little friend?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.339
You want to meet her?

04:19.468 --> 04:22.802
Heya, sexy.
A little later. What do you say?

04:22.929 --> 04:24.045
Hmm? Yeah.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.798
Well
Mm...

04:31.146 --> 04:33.809
And now my erection
is completely gone, thank you.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.806
What is all this?

04:35.942 --> 04:39.902
Doc, it's, uh...
Uh, it's time we had the talk.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.692
Now, at 21:00 sharp,

04:41.823 --> 04:43.985
Tunnel V. will move
into position underground,

04:44.117 --> 04:46.655
snug as a bug
next to ol' Doc Venture's lab.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.028
With the subway as cover,

04:48.163 --> 04:49.807
I can tunnel through
the foundation over there,

04:49.831 --> 04:50.892
and no one will
even hear a peep.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.499
At 21:20, I reach
the Ven-Tech ventilation access.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.414
Oh!
That's where I come in!

04:55.545 --> 04:57.753
The vents are laser-shielded
and too small

04:57.881 --> 04:58.962
for any old dum-dum,

04:59.090 --> 05:02.128
so I just presto change-o
into a snake

05:02.260 --> 05:04.297
and slither into the lab.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.886
Presto plugs
this transmitter

05:06.014 --> 05:07.550
into Venture's
security mainframe,

05:07.682 --> 05:10.265
and voilÃ ,
his whole system is my bitch.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.430
Once Dot shuts off the alarms
and opens the doors,

05:12.562 --> 05:14.645
I grab the goods,
load them into Presto.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.891
After I presto change-o
into a human hand truck,

05:18.026 --> 05:20.734
Ooh! A <i>man</i> truck.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.070
We haul them out
the loading dock, south exit.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.406
Where Driver X will be waiting
to whisk y'all

05:25.534 --> 05:27.821
to the safe house
for champagne and revelry.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.069
Questions?

05:29.204 --> 05:30.536
New guy.
How'd I guess?

05:30.664 --> 05:32.584
Yeah, uh, where am I
while all this is happening?

05:32.707 --> 05:35.165
Oh, you're our eyes in the sky,
pretty bird.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.750
Aerial reconnaissance.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.165
You'll be making a big old
loop-de-loop all around

05:39.297 --> 05:40.297
that there Ven-Tech.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.710
- So I'm a lookout?
- Now he gets it.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.425
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute!

05:44.553 --> 05:46.761
If anyone should be taking lead
on this thing,

05:46.888 --> 05:47.969
it's the Mighty Monarch.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.841
I've got decades
of hot skinny on Venture.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.184
I know how he thinks,
how he takes his coffee.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.973
I... I can tell you
his Sleep Number!

05:55.105 --> 05:56.892
Sure.
That sounds super useful.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.390
It's 25!
He's soft.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.564
I say we scrap this whole plan
and start from the top.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.777
You don't arch a Venture

06:03.905 --> 06:05.487
by sneaking around
in his crawl space.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.777
You hit him high,
and you hit him hard!

06:07.909 --> 06:09.866
Copycat, you have, like,
a Copy-copter

06:09.995 --> 06:11.702
for the initial aerial assault?

06:11.830 --> 06:14.038
Told you we should've
just bought a drone.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.406
Looky here now, songbird.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.249
I'm the leader
of this here band,

06:17.377 --> 06:19.790
and I say we ain't changing
the set list

06:19.921 --> 06:21.287
an hour before showtime.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.959
An hour before...
Wait. What?!

06:23.091 --> 06:24.172
Oh, yes, sir.

06:24.301 --> 06:29.513
Curtain goes up at 21:00 sharp,
tonightsville.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.596
So you've licked
teleportation, huh?

06:31.725 --> 06:33.466
Well, give yourself
a fat pat on the back.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.343
That's what we
in the supersecret biz

06:35.478 --> 06:36.844
call a game-changer.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.812
Right?
I was just telling Brock...

06:38.940 --> 06:40.647
- That's why you have to kill it.
- What?

06:40.775 --> 06:42.128
Decommission it.
Scrap it for parts.

06:42.152 --> 06:45.486
Torch all your files and never,
ever speak of it again.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.150
Uh, why would I do that?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.989
Okay, let's say
you grace the world

06:49.117 --> 06:51.325
with this technological
brain fart of yours.

06:51.453 --> 06:53.410
Have you given any thought
to what happens next?

06:53.538 --> 06:56.155
Pfft, you mean after
they slap a Nobel on me?

06:56.291 --> 06:59.329
I retire to Spanakopita
on a pile of money and women.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.498
What happens to FedEx
when grandma could just zap

07:01.630 --> 07:04.122
her famous fruitcake
to her kiddies in Kalamazoo?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.624
How about the auto industry,
the airlines, big oil?!

07:06.760 --> 07:09.298
Global economy would go ass
over teakettle, that's what.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.263
Some extremely powerful people
ain't gonna like that,

07:12.390 --> 07:14.382
and they're gonna
come a-gunning for you.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.600
Isn't it kind of your job
to protect me?

07:16.728 --> 07:19.721
We kind of are, Doc.
From yourself.

07:19.856 --> 07:21.563
Shut it down
and hand it over,

07:21.691 --> 07:24.650
or we'll shut it down
and get real handsy about it.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.770
Ugh, this is crazy.
It's a free country.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.147
Mm-hmm.
Is it, now?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.774
What, are you gonna
torture me now?

07:31.910 --> 07:32.910
Brock, what the "F"?

07:33.036 --> 07:36.154
- It ain't like that, Doc.
- More like group therapy.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.326
But wait a minute!
Where are you going, Brock?!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.324
What's gonna happen to me?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.043
Hello? Brock?

07:43.171 --> 07:45.208
Judas!

07:48.301 --> 07:50.543
<i>Greetings, Dr. Venture.</i>

07:50.679 --> 07:53.797
<i>We've been watching you
for some time.</i>

07:53.932 --> 07:55.423
And you are...?

07:55.558 --> 07:59.051
<i>Oh, we've gone by many names
throughout the centuries.</i>

07:59.187 --> 08:01.600
<i>- The Knights Templar.
- The Illuminati.</i>

08:01.731 --> 08:04.644
<i>The Rothschild/Bilderberg
Super Sentinels.</i>

08:04.776 --> 08:09.066
<i>We... Well, we kind of
secretly control the world.</i>

08:09.197 --> 08:11.780
<i>Until now we've been happy
to remain in shadows</i>

08:11.908 --> 08:15.151
<i>insomuch as your business
has not interfered with ours,</i>

08:15.286 --> 08:18.825
<i>but this teleporter of yours,
it's really a game-changer.</i>

08:18.957 --> 08:20.914
What is this,
some kind of threat?

08:21.042 --> 08:24.001
<i>No, Dr. Venture,
an invitation.</i>

08:24.129 --> 08:26.416
<i>As we said,
we've been watching you,</i>

08:26.548 --> 08:30.462
<i>and we think you have what
it takes to become one of us.</i>

08:30.593 --> 08:33.176
<i>Think of it...
power beyond your imagining,</i>

08:33.304 --> 08:37.092
<i>untold riches,
your every desire fulfilled.</i>

08:37.225 --> 08:40.592
<i>And all you need do is give up
one little invention.</i>

08:40.729 --> 08:41.311
Ugh.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.645
<i>You don't have to
make your mind up now.</i>

08:43.773 --> 08:47.392
<i>As it happens, we're convening
in secret this very night,</i>

08:47.527 --> 08:49.644
<i>and we'd very much like
to meet you...</i>

08:49.779 --> 08:51.736
<i>in the flesh, as it were.</i>

08:51.865 --> 08:54.949
<i>Come.
See what we can offer you.</i>

08:55.076 --> 08:57.068
<i>Then decide.</i>

09:01.666 --> 09:02.666
<i>Otra vez.</i>

09:02.709 --> 09:04.996
Come on.
<i>MÃ¡s fuerte.</i>

09:06.463 --> 09:08.420
<i>Mucho mejor.
Tiempo fuera</i>, Manolo.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.130
Hey. How's your
super-heist meeting?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.796
Super fucked! This heist
is going down tonight.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.795
Tonight? I thought it was
just a meet-and-greet.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.796
So did I!
Like a get-to-know-ya.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.514
- A go-see.
- Exactly!

09:19.642 --> 09:20.974
No, it's all happening
like now,

09:21.102 --> 09:22.329
and I'm supposed
to fly and shit,

09:22.353 --> 09:23.560
and I don't have my wings!

09:23.688 --> 09:24.974
Check your back, dude.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.314
No, smartass,
these are my cape wings.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.802
They're for showing,
not for going.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.943
I need the good wings,
the Glengarry wings.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.438
They're in the, uh,
basement, cave, whatever.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.111
- Find them!
- All right, all right! Hold on.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.700
Aerial reconnaissance.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.864
Dicks.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.158
Yeah, Copycat's place
is pretty rad, though.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.170
It's got these fancy
guest soaps that smell like

09:44.250 --> 09:46.617
an Italian gigolo
smoking a grapefruit cigarette.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.189
Hey, bug boy!

09:48.213 --> 09:49.690
What, you curling
your eyebrows in there?

09:49.714 --> 09:50.830
Giddyap!

09:50.965 --> 09:52.456
Just a minute!

09:52.592 --> 09:53.952
- Okay, I found them.
- Great.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.217
Now get them over here fast.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.007
And make up a good cover story,
will you?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.846
These people already look at me
like I'm a Johnny Stupid.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.221
Just a little further, Doc.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.393
Oh, did you say something?

10:04.521 --> 10:05.887
Because I don't speak
to traitors.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.638
It's for your own good.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.891
Oh, sure!
That's what the Nazis said!

10:10.026 --> 10:11.358
No, they didn't.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.478
Well, I... I thought you
were about to say

10:13.613 --> 10:16.151
you were only
following orders.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.865
All right.
You can take it off now.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.742
Get a load of this guy.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.035
I don't know if you should
trust him with your car.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.167
I'm not.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.580
Huh. So hard finding
good help these days.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.590
Uh...

10:33.591 --> 10:36.755
Your hosts
are all waiting inside.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.256
- May I take your coat, sir?
- What?

10:42.392 --> 10:45.681
Oh, uh, sure.
Uh, thanks.

10:47.000 --> 10:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:00.118 --> 11:01.154
Oh.

11:06.249 --> 11:08.662
I think I'm overdressed.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.083
<i>All right, team. This ain't
no dress rehearsal now.</i>

11:13.214 --> 11:15.627
Curtain's fixing to go up.
Y'all on your marks?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.841
We've, uh,
reached the entry point there.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.710
We're, uh, ready to drill
on Dot's signal.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.132
I'm all set up out here.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.130
All systems online
and ready to go.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.259
Sergeant Sloppy is about
to start his nightly rounds,

11:26.394 --> 11:29.057
and I've got a northbound
"A" train approaching

11:29.189 --> 11:32.648
in five, four, three, two...

11:32.775 --> 11:33.836
Okay, go.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.068
You've got 60 seconds.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.279
Swell, swell.
Right on schedule.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.490
Hey, Mighty Monarch,
how we looking topside?

11:41.618 --> 11:44.326
Uh, everything looks great
from up here,

11:44.454 --> 11:46.912
where I am currently flying.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.085
Oh. Hmm.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.924
You don't see that every day.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.052
Oh, hi!

12:00.094 --> 12:01.881
Are, uh...
Are you one of the guys

12:02.013 --> 12:03.720
I spoke to earlier
on the, uh...

12:04.724 --> 12:05.931
Ah.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.268
- Thinking of joining?
- Hmm?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.890
I haven't
made up my mind yet.

12:15.026 --> 12:19.361
Ohh! You mean joining
the, uh orgy?

12:19.489 --> 12:21.526
Perhaps a bit
of liquid courage?

12:21.658 --> 12:24.071
Ah!
Capital idea, Jeeves.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.945
Oh, uh, is it an open bar?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.196
But of course, sir.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.788
Ah! Swell.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.374
Don't suppose you know how to
make a Red Mocho Kooler, do you?

12:32.502 --> 12:33.913
Whatever you desire.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.088
Oh!
These are amazing.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.136
Yes.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.096
The orphan sashimi
is positively decadent.

12:46.224 --> 12:47.510
I'm sorry?
Orphan...

12:47.642 --> 12:49.759
Sashimi.
Extra virgin, of course.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.262
Our chef insists on only
the very cleanest orphans.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.233
Bah, ugh!

13:02.365 --> 13:03.981
Ooh, swell party, hmm?

13:10.665 --> 13:12.201
Having a good time?

13:12.333 --> 13:15.041
Well, apparently,
I just ate part of a small child

13:15.169 --> 13:16.876
and then washed it down
with penis, so...

13:17.005 --> 13:18.245
Hey, if that's
what you're into.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.831
What? No!
Actually, I'm a little lost.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.503
Are you a member
of this, uh...

13:22.635 --> 13:25.423
Pseudo-religious
capitalist crony club?

13:25.555 --> 13:26.555
God, no.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.138
Just an anonymous
working girl

13:28.266 --> 13:30.508
here to service
the masters of the universe.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.259
Oh. Ohh.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.978
This gig was a lot easier
before they inducted the guy

13:35.106 --> 13:36.563
who invented Viagra,
I'll tell you.

13:36.691 --> 13:40.105
That's him over there next
to big oil and big tobacco.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.898
They're the ones
double-teaming Patty.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.272
Uh, do I know you?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.444
No.
You don't want to do that here.

13:46.576 --> 13:52.038
Uh, then perhaps we should
go somewhere more private.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.407
May I borrow her?

13:54.584 --> 13:58.203
Meet me by the tapestries
in 20 minutes.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.006
Presto change-o, I'm in!

14:11.142 --> 14:12.142
<i>Good!</i>

14:12.185 --> 14:14.472
<i>Find the mainframe and get
that transmitter plugged in.</i>

14:15.605 --> 14:17.346
Ooh!
Someone's coming!

14:19.233 --> 14:22.943
It's Samson!
What do I do?

14:23.071 --> 14:25.438
Dude, what?!
He's not supposed to be here!

14:25.573 --> 14:26.842
Oh, good Lord.
This ain't good.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.986
Ah, that's it.
Let me at him.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.696
<i>Hold your position, Ramburglar.</i>

14:29.827 --> 14:31.467
You bust in before
I've hacked the system,

14:31.579 --> 14:33.115
you'll trigger
a total lockdown.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.704
Monarch, plan B.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.869
Plan B?
What... What plan B?

14:37.001 --> 14:40.210
<i>God, did you pay, like,
no attention at the meeting?</i>

14:40.338 --> 14:41.338
<i>Proceed to
the Venture penthouse</i>

14:41.339 --> 14:42.750
<i>and create a diversion</i>

14:42.882 --> 14:45.374
<i>to draw Samson away
from the lab stat!</i>

14:45.510 --> 14:47.923
- Okay!
- Uh! I'm here, I'm here.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.216
- Subway took forever.
- Oh, thank God!

14:50.348 --> 14:52.510
- You got my wings, Mr. Late?
- Yeah, yeah, here.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.508
Dude, can I use
Copycat's bathroom?

14:54.644 --> 14:57.307
Yeah, whatever. Wait.
What... What the fuck is this?

14:57.438 --> 14:59.475
It's your wings. That was
gonna be my cover story.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.224
Your cover story is
I shit myself?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.712
Hey, you make a lie
embarrassing enough,

15:03.736 --> 15:04.977
and nobody questions it.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.105
Eh, all right.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.908
Samson's going
for the teleporters.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.356
We ain't got time for this
flying fuck-up to make his move.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.037
I've got an idea.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.001
H.E.L.P.eR.
Heya, buddy.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.293
I didn't see you...
Ah, geez, did Doc paint you?

15:25.925 --> 15:29.214
Nice work, Presto.
I'm in.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.632
- H.E.L.P.eR.?
- Uh...

15:33.391 --> 15:35.974
Dot, do something!

15:42.024 --> 15:43.140
Oh, good Lord.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.892
Dottie, what in the "H"
did you do?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.268
I'm not doing that!

15:46.404 --> 15:48.487
It's some kind of
emergency evac or something!

15:48.614 --> 15:49.855
I can't stop it.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.620
Aha! I got one!

15:57.748 --> 16:00.957
Good for you, toy man.
Now you're gonna get dead.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.420
- Who needs a refill?
- Yeah!

16:13.556 --> 16:15.798
Rejiggered that
old emergency evac

16:15.933 --> 16:18.141
to send the goods
exactly where we want them.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.385
Swell hacking, Mac.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.136
Our little old decoy team

16:21.272 --> 16:23.730
must be in a whole heap
of hot water.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.316
That was the plan, my man.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.777
Not a good time!

16:32.909 --> 16:35.447
Dude, dude, you got to abort!
Abort!

16:35.578 --> 16:37.615
Copycat has got
another heist team!

16:37.747 --> 16:39.955
You're being set up!
You're decoys!

16:40.082 --> 16:41.082
You're

16:41.167 --> 16:44.160
You're breaking up.
Wait! What? Aah!

16:46.297 --> 16:48.505
Oh! Ah!

16:48.633 --> 16:51.046
Owie.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.294
Enh! Aah!

16:53.429 --> 16:55.421
Ow!

16:57.683 --> 17:00.016
What? No way.

17:07.151 --> 17:11.566
"The Unicorn is in Captivity
and No Longer Dead,"

17:11.696 --> 17:13.404
Late 15th century.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.900
A truly exquisite piece.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.071
And such an apt metaphor.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.038
Because, let me guess,
I'm the unicorn,

17:21.165 --> 17:22.326
and now I'm your prisoner.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.915
No, you're looking
at it all wrong.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.127
Look at that little unicorn,
the beatific smile.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.872
He's happy now.

17:30.007 --> 17:33.626
He gets to live
in a beautiful garden.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.047
Yeah, in a cage.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.045
A protective barrier.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.218
No one's hunting him anymore,

17:39.350 --> 17:42.138
nor can he hurt anyone
with that horn of his.

17:42.270 --> 17:43.932
Yeah, well,
if it's all the same to you,

17:44.063 --> 17:45.474
this little unicorn

17:45.606 --> 17:47.472
would rather take his chances
in the wilderness

17:47.608 --> 17:50.191
with his sweet-ass teleporter.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.237
Oh, I'm afraid that's not

17:54.365 --> 17:56.823
one of your options,
Dr. Venture.

17:56.951 --> 18:00.444
No doubt you've read
"The Lady or the Tiger"?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.287
Well, not word for word, but...

18:02.415 --> 18:05.032
Behind door number one,
the lady.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.375
I believe you two
have already met.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.961
Give up your teleporter
and join us,

18:10.089 --> 18:11.625
and she's all yours,

18:11.757 --> 18:13.589
as is anything else
you could ever desire.

18:13.718 --> 18:17.883
Behind door number two,
meet Tiger.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.007
Tiger has desires, too.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.349
Wha... What?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.513
Please tell me
this is another metaphor.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.604
Cold, hard truth,
Dr. Venture.

18:27.732 --> 18:32.147
In this world,
it's fuck or be fucked.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.362
So which will it be?

18:35.489 --> 18:37.822
Just go, Rambo.
We got one of them.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.532
No, job was for both.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.971
You're gonna drill
this boy's knees

18:40.995 --> 18:43.112
till he tells us
where the other one went.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.283
Oh, you are good, Monarch.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.455
Aah!

18:50.838 --> 18:52.670
Oh, dang, I'm hit!

18:54.508 --> 18:56.044
Aah! Uh, uh!

18:57.345 --> 18:59.803
- Oh, God.
- Oh, he's coming to! Grab it!

18:59.930 --> 19:01.046
I... How?!

19:01.182 --> 19:03.014
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:04.518 --> 19:07.056
Ahhh.
Amateurs.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.269
I need backup.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.810
Hostiles have taken the package,
and I'm in pursuit.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.649
Come on out of there
right now, Monarch,

19:13.778 --> 19:15.485
and I promise
I'll only wound you.

19:15.613 --> 19:16.694
Just come out of there!

19:16.822 --> 19:18.859
There really is no way out!

19:31.754 --> 19:35.794
Copycat 3 to Copycat Prime,
the package is secure.

19:35.925 --> 19:36.961
Aah!

19:40.763 --> 19:44.006
How in the...?
This is just bananagans!

19:53.025 --> 19:55.517
Listen, you guys don't know me,
but you got to trust me.

19:55.653 --> 19:57.144
You guys...
What the fuck?!

19:57.279 --> 19:59.862
- Dude, who the hell are you?
- I'm... I'm with the Monarch!

19:59.990 --> 20:01.218
You guys
got to get out of here!

20:01.242 --> 20:02.403
This whole thing
is a setup!

20:02.535 --> 20:04.572
- What did you do to Driver X?
- What? I didn't...

20:04.704 --> 20:06.570
There wasn't even
a guy in there.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.288
Start...
Start the truck, Chief.

20:08.416 --> 20:10.248
Samson is right on our tails.
I think

20:10.376 --> 20:12.242
Aah! Aaaah!

20:12.378 --> 20:14.119
You're Driver X now, fatty.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.622
Take this!
I'll slow him down!

20:16.757 --> 20:19.295
Presto change-o!

20:21.220 --> 20:24.054
Oh, stop!

20:24.181 --> 20:26.013
Stupid!

20:26.142 --> 20:27.929
Aaah!

20:28.686 --> 20:31.975
Whoa! W-T-F?!

20:33.774 --> 20:36.141
Aaaaah!

20:36.277 --> 20:37.563
Geez!

20:40.114 --> 20:42.572
Copycat 3 to Copycat Base,

20:42.700 --> 20:44.566
got a big old mayday
on my hands here.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.160
Holy mackerel, the engine
is shot, literal like.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.768
Abort-a-rooney time.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.293
Well, now doesn't that
just put a turd in your soup?

20:59.717 --> 21:01.549
Come on!

21:01.677 --> 21:03.168
Aah!

21:06.432 --> 21:07.639
Aaah!

21:17.443 --> 21:19.480
- 'Sup?
- Hey.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.989
Move, move,
move, move, move, move!

22:04.949 --> 22:08.283
Ah!

22:08.410 --> 22:09.742
You were right!

22:09.870 --> 22:13.409
Oh, this is the best decision
I ever made.

22:13.541 --> 22:17.205
I'm the king of the world!

22:17.336 --> 22:19.669
Ahh.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.629
Get a nerd laid,

22:21.757 --> 22:24.625
and they think
they're masters of the universe.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.171
Ooh!
