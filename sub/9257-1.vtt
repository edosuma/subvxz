00:38.665 --> 00:41.153
No. No.

00:41.321 --> 00:43.264
No!

01:18.769 --> 01:21.610
I sent Corrine's picture to hotels
with weekly and monthly rates.

01:21.650 --> 01:24.011
Night manager called
when he got the fax.

01:24.051 --> 01:27.946
Said she checked in about a week ago
as a… Jan Murphy?

01:28.115 --> 01:29.812
Which room?

01:29.845 --> 01:32.333
She's not alone up there, Vic.

01:32.692 --> 01:34.765
–I know. She's got my kids with her.
–No kids.

01:34.805 --> 01:38.318
There's someone else.
Ran the plates.

01:38.517 --> 01:41.230
Guy's name is Steven Linfield.
He owns a yoga studio.

01:41.270 --> 01:42.832
She's probably takin' classes with him.

01:42.872 --> 01:46.254
When my gash of an ex-wife
ditched me, first thing she did…

01:46.294 --> 01:48.215
was got that ass real tight.

01:48.248 --> 01:51.280
–Manager said the guy's
been up there every night.
–Which room?

01:51.320 --> 01:54.637
It's 209.
Vic, wait.

01:55.961 --> 01:57.685
Wait.

01:59.066 --> 02:01.587
Vic, don't…
don't do this.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.303
What the…

02:17.502 --> 02:20.983
What do you want?
Who are you?

02:24.479 --> 02:26.585
I'm s…

02:26.719 --> 02:28.956
I-I don't know. I…

02:29.120 --> 02:32.408
Manager confirmed two different photos,
swore it was her.

02:32.448 --> 02:35.513
You've been on this thing for a month.
You can't find three kids and a housewife?

02:35.553 --> 02:38.554
No money trail.
The kids haven't been in school.

02:38.594 --> 02:40.315
She's not with friends
or relatives.

02:40.355 --> 02:43.787
Look, if we don't expand
our search beyond So. Cal….

02:43.843 --> 02:45.764
You know,
maybe I should, uh…

02:45.797 --> 02:48.892
check hospitals, accident reports…
–Look, they're alive.

02:48.932 --> 02:50.907
Just find them.

02:53.061 --> 02:55.003
Come on. Hurry up.

02:56.326 --> 02:58.750
Fresh from Mexico.
Still has its cherry.

02:58.790 --> 03:00.579
Crack the seal.

03:09.065 --> 03:11.705
Two shipments in a week.
That's not bad.

03:22.699 --> 03:24.674
–We're pregnant.
–Beautiful.

03:27.692 --> 03:29.936
Wrap it up.
We'll follow you home.

03:34.541 --> 03:37.671
You know, when we double up on shipments,
sooner or later someone's gonna notice.

03:37.711 --> 03:41.606
Hey, Vic put me in charge, all right?
It's working, okay?

03:41.743 --> 03:46.316
So just roll with it.
Oh, Christ. Couple of salties.

03:46.513 --> 03:48.489
–They're gonna roust 'em.
–What do we do if they find that coke?

03:48.529 --> 03:51.626
–That's 50 grand each, gone.
–Three black guys with
a trunk full of cocaine…

03:51.666 --> 03:54.568
can't drive the goddamn speed limit?

03:54.705 --> 03:56.975
Ohh. Great.

03:57.138 --> 04:01.295
–I knew this was a mistake.
–Shut up. Let me think.

04:01.459 --> 04:03.794
Hey, you're in charge.

04:03.955 --> 04:05.803
Hey, we're in this together.

04:09.813 --> 04:12.945
Hey, lookee here, Clark.

04:14.358 --> 04:16.779
–Whoa!
–Don't shoot!

04:16.950 --> 04:19.439
–Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
–I'm a brother cop.

04:19.478 --> 04:22.128
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's all right.
It's cool. We're cops.

04:22.168 --> 04:23.891
Here you go.

04:27.449 --> 04:30.961
Look, uh, you're not gonna believe this,
but you just nailed my informant.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.810
We're on our way to a bust.
That's-That's our coke.

04:33.850 --> 04:36.116
–Who's in charge of the sting?
–Mackey's our team leader.

04:36.156 --> 04:38.355
I'll give him a call
and get him down here.

04:38.395 --> 04:40.534
–Who's your C.O.?
–Aceveda.

04:40.668 --> 04:42.978
Yeah, well, I'm gonna call him too.

04:43.036 --> 04:45.940
Sure, if you don't mind
waking up a captain.

04:47.101 --> 04:48.890
I don't mind.

04:51.294 --> 04:53.654
Burning necklaces
have been gaining popularity…

04:53.694 --> 04:56.470
in Central and South American
drug cartels.

04:56.510 --> 04:59.773
Only a matter of time
before se mueve Al Norte.

04:59.936 --> 05:02.840
South Africa's A.N.C also
used tire necklaces…

05:02.880 --> 05:04.664
to torture and kill impimpi.

05:04.704 --> 05:07.454
–Impimpi?
–Police informants.

05:07.713 --> 05:10.682
–And since when do you speak Spanish?
–I'm taking a class.

05:10.722 --> 05:12.994
I work in Los Angeles.

05:13.028 --> 05:18.440
Not knowing the language was limiting me
from being the best detective I could be.

05:27.845 --> 05:30.017
Hiya. I'm Detective Vic Mackey.

05:30.150 --> 05:32.420
–These your men?
–Depends.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.885
What'd they do?

05:35.015 --> 05:38.304
We pulled over these guys, found some
weapons and a sizable amount of cocaine.

05:38.344 --> 05:43.266
–These guys say it's for a buy-bust.
–That's right.

05:43.401 --> 05:45.505
They were supposed to
meet me over in Farmington.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.265
Nobody notified
our department.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.794
We're waiting on a Captain Aceveda
to clear things up.

05:49.834 --> 05:53.596
Ah, it's not necessary. We're late as it is.
By the time…

05:54.283 --> 05:56.771
Aceveda shows up…

06:03.341 --> 06:05.610
What's going on?

06:05.742 --> 06:08.390
We pulled over these men
with several kilos of cocaine.

06:08.430 --> 06:11.014
–I was gonna give you a heads-up.
–They claim they're on their way to a bust…

06:11.054 --> 06:14.024
you authorized in Farmington.
–I didn't have…

06:19.600 --> 06:22.729
I didn't forward the C-90.
I take responsibility.

06:22.769 --> 06:26.993
Apologize to your C.O for me.
I guarantee it won't happen again.

06:28.274 --> 06:32.301
Sure. Sorry to hold you guys up.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.571
No, no. You were right to call me.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.586
Look, I'm sorry about…

06:39.860 --> 06:41.901
–You're on your way to a bust, right?
–Yes, sir.

06:41.941 --> 06:45.073
–Then go arrest someone.
–Yes, sir.

06:50.039 --> 06:52.341
You and I need to talk…

06:52.503 --> 06:54.413
now.

07:12.219 --> 07:15.316
Hey, thanks for cutting us some slack
on that little paperwork snafu.

07:15.356 --> 07:18.132
You've been logging less hours.
Arrests are way down.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.086
Bad guys must be hibernating.

07:20.093 --> 07:21.846
–Is everything okay with you?
–Sure.

07:21.886 --> 07:24.182
Because you're a lot of things,
but sloppy isn't one of them.

07:24.222 --> 07:26.903
Why don't you just give me
a demerit and call it a night?

07:26.943 --> 07:29.303
A civilian auditor's
been assigned to the barn.

07:29.343 --> 07:31.223
She gets a whiff
of what I've been smelling lately…

07:31.263 --> 07:33.112
she's gonna slam a lid
on this whole place.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.880
Well, that's your problem.

07:34.914 --> 07:37.913
I don't think she'll be as understanding
of your paperwork snafus as I am…

07:37.953 --> 07:40.288
which makes it
our problem.

07:40.353 --> 07:44.699
–This drug business tonight…
–Shane and the boys are out
making arrests as we speak.

07:44.739 --> 07:47.579
You better find your game,
and you better find it quick.

07:47.619 --> 07:49.856
I never lost it.

07:55.012 --> 07:58.365
The two victims have been I.D'd
as Pablo Fernando and Christopher Reyes.

07:58.405 --> 08:00.445
Street names are
Bang Bang and Cuca.

08:00.485 --> 08:03.103
We got two dead bangers,
two different gang affiliations.

08:03.143 --> 08:04.834
A Los Mag and a Toro.

08:04.999 --> 08:07.007
Both high-level lieutenants
in the drug racket.

08:07.047 --> 08:10.368
You can understand why they'd want to kill
each other. Who'd want to kill 'em both?

08:10.408 --> 08:13.792
–Well, that's the mystery, isn't it?
–Keep an eye out for the tag.

08:13.832 --> 08:15.457
Talk to your contacts.
Find out what's brewing.

08:15.497 --> 08:17.697
Maybe it would help
to recreate the crime.

08:17.737 --> 08:20.072
¡Ay, Dios mio!
I'm burning!

08:23.626 --> 08:28.002
Hey, hey, Smitty.
Get these two to the morgue A.S.A.P.

08:29.902 --> 08:34.020
Just a reminder: Lanie Kellis will begin
observing activities today in the barn.

08:34.061 --> 08:35.784
She's a civilian auditor.

08:35.885 --> 08:38.664
I know, but there was a riot…
the whole Gilroy scandal.

08:38.703 --> 08:41.871
You can't expect the city council
to do nothing.

08:45.327 --> 08:47.913
Say hello to fall guy number one
and fall guy number two.

08:47.953 --> 08:51.240
–Hey, why are you turning in Tio's stash?
–It's not Tio's coke.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.674
–It's theirs.
–They had that much blow on 'em?

08:53.714 --> 08:56.169
–I thought they were small-time.
–They were until tonight.

08:56.209 --> 08:58.089
I see you've made some arrests.

08:58.129 --> 08:59.690
–Yes, sir.
–Good.

08:59.890 --> 09:03.179
Finish the paperwork, return the coke
to Property, and move on to your next case.

09:03.219 --> 09:04.746
Yes, sir.

09:05.811 --> 09:08.524
That's a ton of weight.
Did he say who's running 'em?

09:08.564 --> 09:10.542
–Alvarez.
–Well, we better go talk to him…

09:10.582 --> 09:12.429
find out why he's moving
from the minors to the majors.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.983
Aw, goddamn it. What now? Yeah?

09:16.502 --> 09:19.502
Tio, I don't like being here.
What's the problem?

09:19.542 --> 09:21.877
That.
He's puking up blood, man.

09:22.038 --> 09:24.079
–Aah!
–What the hell did you call us for?

09:24.119 --> 09:26.224
Like I'm gonna call a bunch
of paramedics to my drug crib.

09:26.264 --> 09:28.240
–Jesus Christ.
–What the hell's wrong with him?

09:28.280 --> 09:31.088
–I don't know, man.
He looks like he's gonna die.
–Well, did he eat something?

09:31.128 --> 09:33.201
He snuck a few lines
just to check the stuff out.

09:33.241 --> 09:35.314
Snuck a few lines?
What did I say about that?

09:35.354 --> 09:37.906
–Is he allergic?
–Oh, man, he's going into cardiac arrest.

09:37.946 --> 09:40.598
Shit. Get me a towel.
Towel, towel!

09:45.116 --> 09:47.418
Oh, shit.

09:50.909 --> 09:53.626
Come on.

09:53.821 --> 09:56.438
God, it's beating.
We gotta get him to a hospital quick.

09:56.478 --> 09:59.606
Drop him off. Don't answer any questions.
Just get the hell out of there.

09:59.646 --> 10:02.036
–Move.
–Hurry up.

10:05.088 --> 10:07.478
Jesus…
How much did he do?

10:07.648 --> 10:09.529
Just a couple lines. He's not allergic.

10:09.569 --> 10:11.945
Was he mixing?
Maybe the coke's bad.

10:12.097 --> 10:15.546
The coke is not bad. It's-It's fine.
Tio just needs to step on it a little more.

10:15.586 --> 10:17.496
You're so sure. Do a line.

10:17.634 --> 10:20.507
–Have the lab run a sample.
See if someone spiked it.
–Yeah.

10:20.547 --> 10:22.593
Who's gonna mess with my stash?

10:22.691 --> 10:25.343
Somebody with enough product
to step in.

10:25.540 --> 10:28.705
Asshole, 12:00.

10:31.397 --> 10:34.333
Hey, Alvarez.

10:34.470 --> 10:37.310
–You're out early.
–What do you want, man?
–Tell me something.

10:37.350 --> 10:39.199
How does a pissant
crack dealer like you…

10:39.239 --> 10:41.343
suddenly start carrying heavy weights
of high-grade coke?

10:41.383 --> 10:43.584
–I'm clean, brother.
–We picked up a couple of your guys.

10:43.624 --> 10:46.816
Who gave you the coke?
Who's trying to push their way in?

10:46.856 --> 10:49.217
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, man.

10:49.257 --> 10:51.963
Let's see if a car ride
jogs your memory.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.852
I guess you don't get to visit
One-niner territory that often…

11:02.892 --> 11:05.136
you being natural enemies and all.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.914
Hey, Mo!

11:08.109 --> 11:11.751
Your sister's ass really taste as sweet
as Alvarez here says it does?

11:11.791 --> 11:14.502
He wants to know what your mama's
putting in the corn muffins.

11:14.542 --> 11:18.471
Excuse me?

11:18.607 --> 11:22.318
–You messing with Tio's coke shipment?
–What? No.

11:22.512 --> 11:24.617
Who gave you the drugs?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.905
You don't help me out,
you're gonna have to find another ride.

11:28.945 --> 11:32.427
Hope those $ 100 pair of
Cortezes help him run faster.

11:32.467 --> 11:35.691
–All right. The Quintero brothers.
–Never heard of 'em.

11:35.731 --> 11:38.634
Armadillo and Navaro.
They're from Tijuana.

11:38.803 --> 11:42.508
They told me to get ready
to flood the streets with blow.

11:42.548 --> 11:45.005
They think they can just come
into Farmington and take over?

11:45.045 --> 11:48.690
–I guess so.
–Guessed wrong.

11:48.886 --> 11:50.800
Hey, get me
out of here, man.

11:50.902 --> 11:53.903
Get out of the way!

11:54.039 --> 11:57.071
Claudette? Your dead guys
may have been cooked up…

11:57.111 --> 11:59.792
by a couple of Mexican nationals.
–You got some names?

11:59.832 --> 12:02.320
One. Quintero.
They're brothers…

12:02.488 --> 12:04.463
Navaro and Armadillo.

12:11.546 --> 12:13.750
–See that guy with Vic?
–Yeah.

12:13.914 --> 12:17.171
He's been in a few times lately.
Any idea who he is?

12:17.211 --> 12:20.148
–Nope.
–He had to sign in at the front desk, right?

12:20.188 --> 12:23.222
–That's the policy.
–You wanna check the log?

12:23.357 --> 12:25.725
Love to.

12:25.885 --> 12:28.987
I'm part of a network
of private investigators.

12:29.022 --> 12:31.062
For a fee, I can get
your wife's info out…

12:31.102 --> 12:34.452
to over 200 P.Is throughout the U.S.
–How much?

12:34.624 --> 12:38.748
For 20 grand,
I can get to half the agencies.

12:38.912 --> 12:41.081
It's good coverage, but less bodies.
Things are gonna move slower.

12:41.121 --> 12:42.873
How much to make things
move faster?

12:42.913 --> 12:45.794
50 grand will cover the entire network.

12:45.828 --> 12:49.243
If she's anywhere in the free 52,
we'll find her fast.

12:49.283 --> 12:51.395
–Do it.
–They don't get started…

12:51.491 --> 12:54.065
unless they have half the fee up front.

12:54.147 --> 12:56.701
I need 25K, like, now.

12:56.900 --> 12:59.388
You'll have your money in an hour.

12:59.589 --> 13:01.469
Who would have wanted to kill your brother?

13:01.509 --> 13:05.139
–You know who Cuca was?
–Drug lieutenant for the Toros.

13:05.990 --> 13:09.312
He was killed along with his counterpart
from Los Mags.

13:09.352 --> 13:12.520
–Were they doing business together?
–Don't know.

13:12.711 --> 13:16.288
Your brother was burned to death. Is there
anything you do know that can help us?

13:16.328 --> 13:20.005
–Nope.
–Mrs Reyes?

13:24.746 --> 13:28.194
Does the name Armadillo
or Navaro mean anything?

13:28.554 --> 13:31.844
–Armadillo?
–Mayda doesn't know anything about this.

13:31.884 --> 13:35.332
–None of us do.
–Again…

13:38.829 --> 13:42.441
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.884
Hey, what's up?

13:51.984 --> 13:54.888
I need to make an emergency withdrawal
from our retirement fund.

13:54.928 --> 13:57.547
You got the key, right?

13:57.745 --> 14:00.434
Vic, there's nothing in there.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.985
–You gotta be joking me.
–No, we took it.

14:03.025 --> 14:05.706
Me, Lemon and Ronnie,
we took it to invest.

14:05.746 --> 14:10.630
–Without telling me?
–You put me in charge while
you were taking time off.

14:12.627 --> 14:14.508
A quarter of that stash is mine.

14:14.548 --> 14:17.584
And I'm in the process
of tripling it for you.

14:17.717 --> 14:19.598
It was… It was
gonna be a surprise.

14:19.638 --> 14:21.361
It is. A bad one.

14:21.558 --> 14:23.438
Look, I've been giving this thing
a lot of thought.

14:23.478 --> 14:26.359
Yeah? And what's your plan, exactly?

14:26.393 --> 14:29.744
I've been stepping up shipments.
I've been overseeing distribution.

14:29.784 --> 14:31.507
Distribution?

14:31.704 --> 14:34.801
We're middlemen keeping the peace, not
drug dealers. What the hell are you doing?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.755
I'm not doing anything
that we weren't doing before.

14:36.795 --> 14:39.602
–I'm just bumping things up a level.
–Well, what level is that?

14:39.642 --> 14:41.682
Prison?

14:44.891 --> 14:47.283
All right.
Where's my investment now?

14:47.323 --> 14:49.012
It's all tied up in the coke shipment.

14:49.052 --> 14:51.892
That coke that had Tio's guy
bleeding from every orifice?

14:51.932 --> 14:54.292
–We don't know that that was the coke.
–I need that money.

14:54.332 --> 14:56.056
Yeah?
Well, we all do.

14:56.253 --> 14:58.519
No, I need it now
to get back my kids.

14:58.559 --> 15:01.859
–What are you talking about?
–They're gone, Shane!

15:02.078 --> 15:04.599
Corrine took 'em and disappeared.

15:06.143 --> 15:08.794
What? When?

15:08.992 --> 15:13.183
–Five weeks ago. God.
–Oh, Jesus.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.641
And I need 25 grand right now
to find them.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.818
–Why didn't you tell me?
–You screwed me!

15:17.858 --> 15:19.516
I didn't…
I didn't screw you.

15:19.556 --> 15:22.875
–I-I was just trying to make things up to you.
–Goddamn it!

15:22.915 --> 15:24.541
I didn't know!

15:24.675 --> 15:27.291
–I lose my family, and now this?
–I didn't know.

15:27.331 --> 15:31.027
–What am I supposed to do now?
–If I'd known, I'd never…

15:32.005 --> 15:34.591
What am I supposed to do?

15:43.815 --> 15:46.653
Cuca's friends say
you were his girlfriend.

15:48.039 --> 15:50.179
You left him for Armadillo?

15:50.312 --> 15:52.582
No.

15:52.745 --> 15:54.468
Jessica Hintel…

15:54.665 --> 15:57.514
senior at the Wedney School for Girls.

15:57.548 --> 16:00.386
Father's chiropractor
to the stars in Bel Air.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.083
How does your father feel about you…

16:02.123 --> 16:05.288
trading down from Westside cheerleader…

16:05.419 --> 16:08.293
to barrio gang babe?
–That angel tattoo on your face…

16:08.333 --> 16:11.963
He must love seeing that
in the family Christmas cards.

16:12.877 --> 16:16.107
–It's a dove.
–Oh.

16:23.823 --> 16:26.704
Two weeks ago…

16:26.737 --> 16:29.192
Cuca and I were
walking down Olympic.

16:30.769 --> 16:33.868
Armadillo and a few
of his guys…

16:34.002 --> 16:36.786
came up to us…

16:36.820 --> 16:40.049
and asked Cuca
if he had changed his mind…

16:40.563 --> 16:43.051
and Cuca said no.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.975
Armadillo took me…

16:46.388 --> 16:49.553
away from Cuca…

16:49.717 --> 16:51.441
to his house.

16:53.685 --> 16:55.929
He told me to take my clothes off.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.706
When he'd finished with me…

17:06.617 --> 17:10.181
he held me down
while another one gave me this tattoo.

17:14.106 --> 17:16.560
A dove…

17:16.730 --> 17:19.119
to remember him by, he said.

17:22.172 --> 17:25.205
When I went back to Cuca…

17:25.339 --> 17:29.083
and he saw the tattoo…

17:29.277 --> 17:31.481
he called me puta.

17:35.486 --> 17:37.691
He wouldn't touch me anymore.

17:42.464 --> 17:45.880
Can you have my dad pick me up, please?

17:53.667 --> 17:55.838
Oh, God. I fell asleep.

17:55.971 --> 17:58.360
Yeah.

18:01.156 --> 18:03.036
What are you gonna tell your wife?

18:03.076 --> 18:04.898
She's out of town.

18:05.092 --> 18:07.798
This is, like, the fifth time this month.

18:08.358 --> 18:10.846
Is it?

18:10.982 --> 18:13.791
We're not wrecking something
that's working, are we?

18:13.831 --> 18:17.956
Nah. We won't let it
turn into a thing.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.892
Good, 'cause
I don't mind a thing. I just…

18:21.416 --> 18:23.681
I just don't want a thing.
You know what I mean?

18:23.721 --> 18:26.689
Yeah, sure.

18:31.946 --> 18:33.735
Hey.

18:38.572 --> 18:41.060
I'll see you around.

18:41.228 --> 18:44.774
Sit down.

18:44.973 --> 18:48.838
The coke's worthless.
It's got rosary pea mixed in it. It's poison.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.050
–Well, he tested it.
–For coke.

18:51.182 --> 18:53.639
Not if it was any good.
If this shit hit the street…

18:53.679 --> 18:55.111
God knows how many bodies
we'd be picking up.

18:55.151 --> 18:57.672
I'm telling you, man. That seal was intact.
These guys saw it.

18:57.712 --> 19:00.104
–You messed with it beforehand.
–I'm a customs guy, for Chrissake.

19:00.144 --> 19:02.056
I was making money
off this stuff too.

19:02.096 --> 19:04.393
If somebody screwed with it,
it happened on the Mexican side.

19:04.433 --> 19:07.113
Well, who handles things
on the Mexican side?

19:07.153 --> 19:10.056
It's, uh, Rosalina Imports in Tijuana.

19:10.194 --> 19:12.203
It's a front for some guy named Navaro.

19:12.243 --> 19:13.999
Navaro Quintero?

19:14.195 --> 19:16.781
Yeah, yeah. That's him.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.210
Jesus Christ.
These guys are up my ass.

19:20.373 --> 19:22.709
Better come out here. Oh!

19:22.743 --> 19:25.230
I got the other P.Is started on it.
You got the dough?

19:25.270 --> 19:27.474
Not yet.
There's a problem.

19:27.606 --> 19:30.447
These guys only started
without the deposit as a favor to me.

19:30.487 --> 19:32.335
You gotta front me.
You'll have the money soon.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.959
–It doesn't work like that.
–You make it work.

19:34.999 --> 19:38.385
–Just keep 'em looking.
–I don't have that kind of cash on hand.

19:38.425 --> 19:40.759
Gordie.

19:40.921 --> 19:43.671
These are my kids, man.
Please.

19:46.234 --> 19:48.498
I'll tell 'em the money's coming tonight.

19:48.538 --> 19:50.262
Thank you.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.728
But this is my reputation, Vic.

19:52.828 --> 19:54.708
You don't have that cash
in my hands by 10:00 tonight…

19:54.748 --> 19:58.048
I'm pulling them off the case,
and I'm off it too.

20:07.166 --> 20:11.288
Ditch your weapons. We're headed south
to get our money back from Navaro.

20:11.328 --> 20:13.638
–What?
–Just do as I say… for once!

20:19.873 --> 20:21.881
Vic, we've been looking for you.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.898
I'd like to introduce you
to Lanie Kellis.

20:23.938 --> 20:27.068
–I'm a little busy right now.
–Miss Kellis is our civilian auditor.

20:27.108 --> 20:29.339
There's some things I'd like
to talk to you about.

20:29.379 --> 20:30.873
I gotta go.

20:32.804 --> 20:34.844
Don't worry.
I'll handle this.

20:36.196 --> 20:38.116
What the hell are you doing?

20:38.150 --> 20:40.638
–I don't have time for this.
–Why? And where are you going?

20:40.678 --> 20:43.296
–Tijuana.
–Mexico? What for?

20:43.462 --> 20:46.366
Someone's putting poisoned coke
out on our streets. I'm gonna stop 'em.

20:46.406 --> 20:48.575
Well, you don't have
jurisdiction across the border.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.809
–Well, I'm taking the day off.
–I'm not authorizing it.

20:51.849 --> 20:54.624
Well, if you want dozens of potential voters
keeling over dead…

20:54.664 --> 20:57.250
so be it, but I'm taking the day off.

21:14.701 --> 21:17.865
Hi. What's the nature
of your visit to Mexico?

21:18.349 --> 21:20.138
Little bit of everything.

21:21.230 --> 21:24.459
Go ahead.
Welcome to Mexico.

21:43.155 --> 21:45.035
Okay, get out.
Go find some guns.

21:45.075 --> 21:48.235
–They got gun stores?
–It's Tijuana. Use your imagination.

21:48.275 --> 21:50.578
Got it.

21:50.740 --> 21:53.424
If we find him, we'll call you up.

21:53.620 --> 21:56.272
Where the hell is Calle Mar Campio?

21:56.469 --> 21:58.830
Come on. Nice girls.
Come on. Come on.

21:58.870 --> 22:01.838
Come in, inside, with girls, nice.
Nice ones. Come on.

22:01.878 --> 22:04.596
–Come over here please.
–Let's go.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.067
Rosalina Imports.

22:06.231 --> 22:08.409
It might as well read “dead end.”

22:08.472 --> 22:11.255
–Now what?
–Goddamn it!

22:11.449 --> 22:13.173
Police.

22:13.369 --> 22:15.737
Is everything okay?

22:15.898 --> 22:18.162
Yeah. We're just
looking for someone.

22:18.202 --> 22:20.341
We're police too, from L.A.

22:20.474 --> 22:23.603
You should be more careful.
This part of town isn't so tourist-friendly.

22:23.643 --> 22:27.473
–A lot of muggings.
–Yeah. Kidnappings too.

22:27.676 --> 22:29.588
A friend of mine's sister
got nabbed here two days ago.

22:29.628 --> 22:33.306
I am sorry to hear that.
Did your friend file a report?

22:33.501 --> 22:36.600
We'd rather pay the ransom
and get her back.

22:36.733 --> 22:39.109
We're looking for
a Navaro Quintero.

22:39.807 --> 22:42.874
Navaro.
I'm not surprised.

22:42.975 --> 22:45.813
He and his brother
are our biggest problem.

22:45.856 --> 22:48.761
Your own government has
a federal warrant for Navaro.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.649
But as long as he's on
our side of the border…

22:50.689 --> 22:53.131
Look, you know where
we can find him?

22:56.258 --> 22:59.520
–Where are we goin'?
–To get your guns.

22:59.682 --> 23:01.723
Keep following.

23:01.827 --> 23:04.379
You know, this place could
be nothing but casinos…

23:04.419 --> 23:06.814
and poontang,
and white-sand beaches.

23:06.854 --> 23:10.941
Instead, look at it.
It's the goddamn asshole of South America.

23:10.981 --> 23:13.186
Mexico's in Central America.

23:14.981 --> 23:17.621
Hey, man, where the hell
are these guns?

23:18.951 --> 23:21.253
Right here.

23:21.415 --> 23:24.001
Where is your money?

23:24.200 --> 23:26.142
Yeah! Your money!

23:27.401 --> 23:29.343
Come on.

23:29.481 --> 23:31.205
Aw, this is bullshit.

23:31.402 --> 23:34.719
Shit, man. Goddamn it.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.591
Give it.

23:39.787 --> 23:42.471
Come on! Give it!

23:42.668 --> 23:44.392
Come on.

23:47.821 --> 23:50.440
Now get out.

23:51.693 --> 23:53.669
Get out!

23:53.806 --> 23:55.748
Get out!

23:56.878 --> 23:59.748
–Detective Wagonback?
–Wagenbach.

23:59.887 --> 24:01.611
Oh, sorry.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.979
Lanie Kellis, civilian auditor.

24:04.112 --> 24:06.251
Oh, uh, right. Hi.

24:06.384 --> 24:08.745
I understand that you were
the lead detective…

24:08.785 --> 24:10.666
in Assistant Chief Gilroy's case.

24:10.706 --> 24:13.867
–Yes, I was.
–The hit-and-run or the land fraud scheme?

24:13.907 --> 24:15.598
Uh, knee-deep in both.

24:15.827 --> 24:19.083
Could I get a look
at your personal notes on that case?

24:19.123 --> 24:22.028
His bail hearing's coming in a few weeks,
and I want to make sure…

24:22.068 --> 24:25.261
that nothing surprises us.
–I'm certainly the man…

24:25.301 --> 24:28.268
to, uh, get you that file.

24:28.406 --> 24:31.472
Um, I'll get it to you
as soon as I can.

24:31.606 --> 24:34.180
–Thanks. I appreciate the help.
–Mayda.

24:34.198 --> 24:35.922
You forgot your notebook.

24:36.119 --> 24:38.421
–Thank you.
–Did you catch him?

24:38.583 --> 24:40.307
–Who?
–Armadillo.

24:40.504 --> 24:42.814
He's the one who
killed my brother.

24:43.928 --> 24:46.568
Armadillo,
he came to the house one day.

24:46.681 --> 24:49.849
He told Cuca
he could join him, or he could die.

24:50.234 --> 24:52.275
He said that with
you in the room?

24:52.315 --> 24:54.643
He kept looking at me,
like he was trying to scare me…

24:54.683 --> 24:57.172
but I'm not afraid of him like Topo is.

24:57.212 --> 24:59.830
Hey, sweetie, how you doin'?

25:00.028 --> 25:03.193
–Dutch.
–Be right back.

25:08.222 --> 25:10.710
–What's she doing here?
–She came in on her own.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.631
Where's the mother?
The brother?

25:12.671 --> 25:14.679
You're interviewing a minor
without a guardian present.

25:14.719 --> 25:16.599
She implicates Armadillo directly.

25:16.639 --> 25:18.424
He made threats to Cuca
right in front of her.

25:18.464 --> 25:20.344
What exactly are we supposed to do
with all that information?

25:20.384 --> 25:22.521
Put her in front of a grand jury,
arrest this guy.

25:22.561 --> 25:24.441
If she can lead us
in the right direction, great.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.682
–But her family doesn't want her to testify.
–She wants to testify.

25:26.722 --> 25:28.636
–And her family doesn't.
–So?

25:28.802 --> 25:31.454
So if you had kids,
you'd understand.

25:31.683 --> 25:33.723
–Mayda?
–Yes?

25:33.859 --> 25:36.445
Hey, come with me, baby.

25:36.643 --> 25:38.880
I'm gonna take you home.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.130
Oh, I lost my barrette.

25:43.301 --> 25:45.090
I'll get you a new one.

25:46.501 --> 25:50.758
–Is something wrong?
–No. I'm gonna take you home.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.737
Are you going to arrest
Armadillo?

25:52.777 --> 25:56.275
We are gonna try.
You're a brave girl for helping us.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.276
–I know.
–Mm-hmm.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.963
Only two guys. You'd think he'd have
more firepower around him.

26:05.003 --> 26:08.633
Probably thinks no one's
crazy enough to mess with him.

26:09.738 --> 26:12.935
Oh, great. We're after
the ugly one up high.

26:13.387 --> 26:15.652
–Give me a piece.
–We had a little problem with the guns.

26:15.692 --> 26:17.540
–What kind of problem?
–Montezuma's revenge.

26:17.580 --> 26:20.297
Oh, shit. They're leaving.
We gotta go.

26:20.493 --> 26:22.318
What?
Th-They're packin'!

26:22.351 --> 26:24.869
–Boss, this is nuts, man.
–Ronnie, go get the car.

26:24.909 --> 26:27.687
Shane, Lem, you take the two big guys.
Take their guns.

26:27.727 --> 26:30.345
I'll take el feo.

26:32.111 --> 26:34.184
Easy, easy.

26:38.448 --> 26:42.408
Hey, can you tell me where
the donkey shows are around here?

26:46.994 --> 26:50.672
Up against the wall!

26:50.868 --> 26:52.686
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

26:52.726 --> 26:56.555
–He's here! Come on!
–Don't even think about it.

26:58.101 --> 27:01.484
–Come on!
–Okay.

27:01.653 --> 27:04.371
Go! Go! Go! Go!

27:04.566 --> 27:07.074
–Here you go.
–You got my boy in here?

27:07.223 --> 27:08.815
–Randall?
–Are you his mother?

27:08.855 --> 27:11.891
–Yes. Why is he locked up?
–Buzz her in, John.

27:15.896 --> 27:17.776
–What did he do?
–A hardware store owner…

27:17.816 --> 27:20.657
caught him shoplifting some spray paint.
–No.

27:20.697 --> 27:25.235
He says he's seen him and his friends
tagging other buildings in the neighborhood.

27:25.275 --> 27:28.243
Is that true?
Did you steal?

27:28.379 --> 27:30.484
You vandalizing now?

27:33.981 --> 27:36.887
We don't usually bring them in this young,
but we couldn't get ahold of you…

27:36.927 --> 27:39.157
and this guy's pretty adamant
about pressing charges.

27:39.197 --> 27:42.038
Look, I cut back on my hours,
so I could be home nights.

27:42.078 --> 27:45.242
I am active in his school.
We go to church…

27:45.375 --> 27:47.415
and still he does this.

27:47.551 --> 27:49.788
What else can I do?

27:49.952 --> 27:51.862
Let me see if I can help.

27:56.673 --> 27:59.096
–She's pretty upset.
–She should be.

27:59.265 --> 28:02.140
He's only ten, and already
he's racking and tagging.

28:02.180 --> 28:05.115
Next, it'll be armed robbery. Before you
know it, we'll be mopping him off a sidewalk.

28:05.155 --> 28:07.292
The mother's doing the best that she can.

28:07.332 --> 28:09.212
I think I can make a difference here.

28:09.252 --> 28:13.278
Julien, come on. You want me
to tell you how this story ends?

28:15.205 --> 28:17.251
Okay, fine.
Knock yourself out.

28:17.349 --> 28:19.923
Who knows?
Maybe it could do some good.

28:27.719 --> 28:30.087
I ain't payin'you nothin', ese.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.289
–Really?
–You let me go right now…

28:33.322 --> 28:36.424
I'll let you get back
across that border alive.

28:37.450 --> 28:39.654
Toss me one of them.

28:43.659 --> 28:47.331
This what your brother Armadillo
does to people who don't cooperate?

28:47.371 --> 28:49.030
You're not cooperating!

28:50.700 --> 28:52.740
Douse him.

29:14.034 --> 29:15.757
Last chance.

29:17.362 --> 29:20.068
How much money are
we talking about, man?

29:21.171 --> 29:23.692
Three-fifty, American.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.615
I can do that.

29:25.812 --> 29:29.261
–Plus 50 for ruining my day.
–Come on, Vic. Don't push it.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.276
Shut the hell up!

29:42.807 --> 29:44.596
Armadillo Quintero?

29:47.352 --> 29:49.108
Yes?

29:49.305 --> 29:52.625
You're a hard man to find.
We'd like to talk to you.

29:52.665 --> 29:55.982
What are you doing
in Los Angeles, Armando?

29:56.154 --> 29:58.515
You mind if I call you Armando?
I have a hard time…

29:58.555 --> 30:02.317
keeping a straight face when I hear
the name “Armadillo.”

30:02.331 --> 30:04.666
I'm looking for
new opportunities.

30:04.828 --> 30:06.749
Those opportunities include…

30:06.782 --> 30:09.269
moving the Toros and the Los Mags
out of the drug business?

30:09.309 --> 30:13.237
It's a little early in the interrogation
to be showing all your cards.

30:13.277 --> 30:16.060
Where do you go now
when I say…

30:16.255 --> 30:19.801
“I don't know who the Toros
or Los Mags are”?

30:19.999 --> 30:23.896
–Our house, our rules.
–Oh, this hasn't always been your house.

30:23.936 --> 30:26.654
This used to be Mexico.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.881
And I've been reading
about your rules.

30:30.017 --> 30:31.866
Yes, we saw the law books at your place.

30:31.906 --> 30:35.260
You could only keep me here for six hours
without charging me with a crime.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.619
You're a prime suspect
in the fire murders of two men last night.

30:38.659 --> 30:42.108
–We can hold you for 24 hours.
–And I can provide many people…

30:42.148 --> 30:44.854
who will be happy to say
I was with them…

30:44.901 --> 30:47.487
when this awful crime took place.

30:47.685 --> 30:49.595
Six hours.

30:49.733 --> 30:53.346
You're not here to fight
the Toros and the Los Mags.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.779
You're here to unite 'em.

30:55.943 --> 30:59.074
One gang, one leader: you.

31:07.913 --> 31:10.274
Uniting the Toros and the Los Mags?
Come on. Think about it.

31:10.314 --> 31:14.115
They stop pissing on each other and turn
their guns on everyday folks… it's not good.

31:14.155 --> 31:16.995
–So how do we keep him here?
–The girlfriend won't testify.

31:17.035 --> 31:20.580
–Mayda will.
–I'm not putting a 12-year-old girl
in the middle of this.

31:20.620 --> 31:24.068
Not with him involved.
We'll find another way.

31:37.423 --> 31:39.366
Here, man.

31:42.992 --> 31:45.361
I have a bad feeling about this.

31:45.394 --> 31:48.907
Keep it to yourself.
All right. No guns, no games.

31:56.820 --> 31:58.734
Drop your guns on the ground!

31:58.868 --> 32:01.257
Okay.

32:06.006 --> 32:08.111
¡El dinero!

32:20.792 --> 32:23.182
What are you doing?

32:23.354 --> 32:25.721
Jesus Christ!

32:27.097 --> 32:30.098
Let's toss him!

32:41.085 --> 32:42.809
–Anybody hit?
–No, man.

32:43.006 --> 32:45.876
Holy shit.
I just leased this car!

32:46.014 --> 32:47.836
What are we doin'?

32:49.086 --> 32:50.808
He's got a federal warrant.

32:50.848 --> 32:54.136
If the feds want him,
I say we let him start doin' his time.

32:54.176 --> 32:56.056
We can't make arrests in Mexico.

32:56.096 --> 32:58.010
Once we get him back home,
won't matter how he got there.

32:58.050 --> 33:00.218
This is insane! His buddies are
out looking for us right now!

33:00.258 --> 33:02.457
We got our money.
Let's just dump him and go.

33:02.497 --> 33:05.819
This prick was willing
to poison dozens of strangers.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.410
If we leave him here, you think
he won't come lookin' for payback?

33:08.450 --> 33:11.035
–How we supposed to
get him across the border?
–In the trunk.

33:11.075 --> 33:13.948
–Same as the money.
–That's if we even make it to the border!
Look at the car!

33:13.988 --> 33:16.540
–How am I gonna pay for this?
–He'll be kicking and screaming
the whole way.

33:16.580 --> 33:20.222
There's 20 farmacias on every block.
We'll go and get a bottle of roofies.

33:20.262 --> 33:24.478
–What, the date rape drug?
–Don't pretend like you don't
know what they look like.

33:24.518 --> 33:26.241
We're gettin' 'em.

33:28.327 --> 33:30.241
Armando was an orphan,
lived on the streets.

33:30.281 --> 33:33.280
I spoke to a woman who
was a social worker years ago.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.422
On a hunch, she gave him
an I.Q test at age 11.

33:39.466 --> 33:42.436
–He lasted a week and a half.
–Didn't fit in?

33:42.570 --> 33:44.323
He raped and beat his teacher.

33:44.363 --> 33:49.219
–When he was 11?
–Two years in Sinaloa juvie,
back on the street after that.

33:49.259 --> 33:52.932
If he hasn't been caught since,
he's gotten a lot smarter.

33:52.972 --> 33:54.852
I'll call I.N.S., see if the rape's…

33:54.892 --> 33:57.334
a violation of his visa requirements.

34:04.046 --> 34:07.335
–Do you have that file for me?
–I'll get it to you soon.

34:07.375 --> 34:12.810
When I ask for something,
I ask politely because that's my nature.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.592
But when you make me ask a second time,
I lose my patience.

34:15.632 --> 34:20.237
This squad has been the epicenter
of police corruption…

34:20.434 --> 34:23.467
civil lawsuits,
and most recently a riot.

34:23.635 --> 34:27.793
The people I work for want answers.
They expect me to get them.

34:29.203 --> 34:32.043
I have the power to recommend changes,
get people fired…

34:32.083 --> 34:34.445
even shut down this entire building
if it's warranted.

34:34.485 --> 34:37.455
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Detective?

34:38.357 --> 34:40.114
Yes, ma'am.

34:42.038 --> 34:47.254
Good. Um, if you could
get me the Gilroy file…

34:47.415 --> 34:50.067
–I would really appreciate it.
–Sure.

34:51.288 --> 34:53.012
Thank you.

35:12.349 --> 35:14.968
–Oh, man.
–Shut up.

35:19.327 --> 35:22.491
How do we explain
400 grand in cash…

35:22.655 --> 35:25.373
and a doped-out
drug lord in our trunk?

35:25.536 --> 35:28.176
Nobody breaks a sweat,
we won't have to.

35:29.377 --> 35:33.087
Come on, boy.
Search.

35:41.955 --> 35:44.956
Any sign of Detective Mackey?

35:45.092 --> 35:47.776
He's still in the field.

35:47.972 --> 35:50.177
“In the field.”

35:50.308 --> 35:55.654
Is that code for “He pretty much goes
wherever he wants without any supervision”?

35:59.047 --> 36:02.347
You're not after Mackey, are you?
You're after me.

36:02.536 --> 36:03.922
I'm not after anyone.

36:07.529 --> 36:10.693
–You have enemies on the city council.
–Who?

36:10.857 --> 36:13.250
They're not thrilled that you
parlayed a scandal and a riot…

36:13.290 --> 36:16.962
into a 15-point lead over Karen Mitchell.
–17-point lead.

36:17.002 --> 36:20.843
They take the heat.
They get bashed in the press.

36:20.876 --> 36:23.012
While you come out
looking like a reformer?

36:23.052 --> 36:25.764
–I'm gonna be a reformer.
–Not if you don't get elected.

36:25.804 --> 36:27.322
I have a 17-point lead.

36:27.501 --> 36:30.405
They're hoping I'll find
something that will change that.

36:30.445 --> 36:32.933
They know I'll be fair,
but they also know…

36:32.973 --> 36:36.141
that if there's something to find,
I'll find it.

36:36.847 --> 36:40.143
I'm glad you know.

36:40.303 --> 36:42.736
Randall. The owner
left it up to me.

36:42.769 --> 36:44.968
He won't press charges
if I vouch for you.

36:45.008 --> 36:46.797
Let's go.

36:49.586 --> 36:51.594
Okay, tell me why
I should let you go.

36:51.634 --> 36:53.416
I don't want to go to jail!

36:53.554 --> 36:56.267
–I don't believe you.
–Henry and I needed some cans.

36:56.307 --> 37:00.236
Henry? Henry who?
Do I need to arrest him too for coercion?

37:00.371 --> 37:03.241
–No. I won't do it again.
–Are you sure?

37:06.901 --> 37:10.102
Okay.
I tell you what.

37:10.135 --> 37:14.675
I'm gonna give you this one.
But remember, I'm vouching.

37:15.062 --> 37:17.263
And if this happens again,
you will have to answer to your mother…

37:17.303 --> 37:19.824
and you will
have to answer to me!

37:20.919 --> 37:23.025
–You got it?
–Yes, sir.

37:30.490 --> 37:32.530
Go sit over there a minute.

37:35.963 --> 37:39.329
–Is he gonna be okay?
–He'll think twice next time.

37:39.740 --> 37:41.908
Thank you.
I'm so worried about him.

37:41.948 --> 37:45.396
You are doing your best.
It's tough these days.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.477
What church do you take him to?

37:47.517 --> 37:50.424
–Faith Temple.
–I've heard good things about them.

37:50.464 --> 37:54.103
–I go to Covenant.
–That's Reverend Cook. Bad smoker, good man.

37:54.143 --> 37:55.550
Yeah, that's him.

37:58.879 --> 38:01.084
So, you gonna be home tonight?

38:01.216 --> 38:03.802
I don't know. Why?

38:05.345 --> 38:09.690
Because I'm not allowed to ask someone
out on a date while I'm on duty and…

38:09.730 --> 38:12.600
Mmm.

38:12.738 --> 38:16.154
Come by.
Maybe I'll be home.

38:32.167 --> 38:34.306
Here you go.

38:34.439 --> 38:36.993
Thanks.

38:56.172 --> 39:00.428
–What's so funny?
–Nothing.

39:00.588 --> 39:03.162
It's been six hours.
You're free to go.

39:03.277 --> 39:06.638
I guess what I did
when I was 11…

39:06.672 --> 39:09.510
doesn't stop me from
visiting your country.

39:13.712 --> 39:17.673
–Okay, stop right there.
–Okay, work it.

39:18.032 --> 39:21.513
–Come on, boy. Work it.
–I.Ds, please,
and can you pop the trunk for me.

39:21.553 --> 39:24.849
Sure. Busy day
for you guys, huh?

39:25.010 --> 39:26.417
Work it. Come on.

39:26.578 --> 39:29.194
–You boys are cops?
–Farmington Division, L.A.

39:29.234 --> 39:32.812
–You guys have a rough time
on the other side?
–Bachelor party.

39:32.852 --> 39:35.692
–Can barely remember the last few days.
–Pop the trunk for me, please.

39:35.732 --> 39:39.726
Sure. Um,
the trunk latch is broke.

39:39.861 --> 39:41.775
Sir, stay in the car, please.

39:41.877 --> 39:44.496
–I will take the keys.
–Sure.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.236
What happened back here?

39:52.439 --> 39:54.163
Oh, uh…

39:54.360 --> 39:56.083
We were in Rosarita.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.769
Madame Marie introduced us
to some of her friends.

39:58.809 --> 40:00.401
Came out this morning,
and it looked like that.

40:00.441 --> 40:03.218
You boys are lucky
you got off with just a few stickers.

40:03.258 --> 40:05.619
Yeah. Hey, you need
some help back there?

40:05.659 --> 40:08.755
You're gonna need to get rid of that wire.
I think I got some pliers in here somewhere.

40:08.795 --> 40:11.130
No, that's all right.

40:11.291 --> 40:13.561
You guys have anything to declare?

40:13.692 --> 40:16.277
Just that it's great
to be back in the States.

40:16.317 --> 40:18.008
Welcome home.

40:31.103 --> 40:34.487
–Get in there.
–Give me the Polaroid.

40:36.321 --> 40:39.329
Quesadilla!

40:39.363 --> 40:43.917
Just wanted to give your little brother
something to remember you by.

40:47.907 --> 40:50.396
–It was creepy.
–How?

40:50.596 --> 40:53.950
The way he laughed to himself,
like something happened.

40:53.990 --> 40:56.477
He was sitting alone for an hour.
What could have happened?

40:56.517 --> 40:59.583
–I don't know.
–Maybe he's just creepy.

40:59.718 --> 41:02.435
No, he was reacting
to something.

41:02.598 --> 41:05.468
–Oh, Ms Kellis.
–Detective Mackey.

41:05.639 --> 41:08.063
I'm really sorry about
hustling out on you earlier.

41:08.103 --> 41:09.795
It did seem very abrupt.

41:09.992 --> 41:12.641
Well, we had a tip
about a Mexican drug lord being in town.

41:12.681 --> 41:14.625
Anyway, we just brought him in.

41:14.665 --> 41:17.282
Got him just as he was about
to head back across the border.

41:17.322 --> 41:20.354
Wanted by the feds on about 15 different
counts. Pretty bad guy.

41:20.394 --> 41:24.163
Uh, but I just wanted to sit with you
and answer a few of your questions.

41:24.203 --> 41:28.034
It can wait until tomorrow.
Congratulations on the arrest.

41:28.140 --> 41:31.589
–Aw, it's a team thing.
–So, we'll talk tomorrow.

41:31.788 --> 41:33.668
I look forward to it,
Ms Kellis.

41:33.708 --> 41:36.197
Me too.
And call me Lanie.

41:43.727 --> 41:46.345
Unbelievable.

41:46.543 --> 41:49.893
–Did anyone talk to him?
–Who?

41:50.064 --> 41:51.946
Armadillo, when
he was in interrogation.

41:51.986 --> 41:55.117
–Nobody was supposed to.
–You check the tapes?

42:02.611 --> 42:03.986
What was that?

42:13.653 --> 42:15.759
What is that?

42:16.790 --> 42:18.929
It's Mayda's barrette.

42:19.958 --> 42:23.254
Oh, God. He knows.

42:23.415 --> 42:26.253
Tio found someone with
an emergency supply.

42:26.296 --> 42:28.689
Enough to get him by till
the next shipment comes in.

42:28.729 --> 42:31.893
–Give me the leftover cash.
–Here you go.

42:34.617 --> 42:37.714
You know, even after writing off the car,
we still come out ahead on this deal.

42:37.754 --> 42:41.450
Asking for 50 grand
for ruining your day was sweet, man.

42:55.134 --> 42:58.431
–Give me your keys.
–What?

42:58.464 --> 43:02.094
I can't trust you with them anymore,
so give 'em to me.

43:06.272 --> 43:09.208
Come on.

43:09.345 --> 43:11.134
Here you go.

43:19.971 --> 43:22.460
–Where's Mayda?
–A friend's house. Why?

43:22.500 --> 43:25.370
Call and check.

43:25.508 --> 43:27.686
–Mayda came to talk to us.
–What?

43:27.716 --> 43:30.525
–She told us about Armadillo.
–No. I told her not to!

43:30.565 --> 43:33.217
We think he knows she spoke to us.

43:33.414 --> 43:35.684
She never what?

43:35.847 --> 43:38.911
–She never showed up. I'll make the call.
–Where is she?

43:38.951 --> 43:42.581
–We'll find her.
–He's gonna kill her!
–We'll find her.

43:50.346 --> 43:54.275
Hey. You okay?

43:55.755 --> 43:58.341
Hmm?

44:10.446 --> 44:12.519
–Mayda…
–No!

44:15.407 --> 44:19.270
–I'm here. It's okay.
–Topo, let us get her to a doctor!

44:19.408 --> 44:21.132
Stop!

44:21.328 --> 44:23.052
–Stay away from us!
–Stop!

44:28.914 --> 44:30.857
Topo! Please!

44:30.994 --> 44:33.744
Let us help her!

44:33.939 --> 44:35.728
Topo, let us help her!

44:42.132 --> 44:45.421
My guy in Denver got a hit
on Corrine's driver's license.

44:45.461 --> 44:48.110
She got a warning
for rolling a stop sign last week.

44:48.150 --> 44:50.454
–In Denver?
–Colorado Springs.

44:50.487 --> 44:53.167
He tracked the license plate,
the address she gave.

44:53.207 --> 44:55.063
Long story short…

44:55.097 --> 44:58.064
he took this photo
about three hours ago.

45:01.209 --> 45:03.795
That's them, isn't it?

45:03.993 --> 45:06.230
Yeah, that's them.

45:06.394 --> 45:08.216
My guy lost 'em in traffic…

45:08.314 --> 45:12.627
but if they're shopping for groceries there,
they gotta be close by.

45:12.667 --> 45:15.799
We're gonna get 'em, Vic.

45:15.931 --> 45:18.834
–Can I keep this?
–Yeah, sure.

45:18.972 --> 45:20.915
I'll call you in a few.

45:57.284 --> 45:59.924
Hey. I didn't know
you made house calls.

46:04.582 --> 46:08.773
This P.I you've been meeting with,
has he found them?

46:08.934 --> 46:12.929
–Found who?
–Your family.

46:13.064 --> 46:18.177
I assume if they were here, your place
would be in a slightly better condition.

46:18.217 --> 46:21.715
At least now I know
what's been making you so sloppy.

46:26.347 --> 46:29.507
By this time next year,
I'm gonna be on the city council.

46:29.547 --> 46:31.428
In six years,
I'm gonna be mayor.

46:31.468 --> 46:34.564
By then, I'll have
much bigger problems than you.

46:34.604 --> 46:37.640
In the meantime,
how do we solve this problem?

46:37.933 --> 46:39.913
–I don't see a problem.
–I do.

46:40.045 --> 46:42.348
Her name's Lanie Kellis.

46:42.414 --> 46:44.871
And as much as I'd love
to see her take you down…

46:44.911 --> 46:47.399
I don't need a scandal right now.

46:47.599 --> 46:49.927
So you and I need
to come to an understanding.

46:49.967 --> 46:53.797
You and me? Right.

46:56.113 --> 46:58.555
I don't see how
you have much choice.

47:01.489 --> 47:04.723
You don't want her and me
gunning for you, right?

47:04.882 --> 47:07.060
You're smart enough
to know that.

47:14.453 --> 47:17.687
–You're gonna watch my back.
–Until the election.

47:18.101 --> 47:20.174
In exchange for what?

47:20.310 --> 47:22.094
You get your head
back in the game.

47:22.134 --> 47:26.556
Get your boys under control,
and don't do anything to embarrass me.

47:28.631 --> 47:30.511
How do I know I can trust you?

47:30.551 --> 47:32.531
How do I know I can trust you?

47:35.129 --> 47:36.853
I guess we have a deal.

47:39.193 --> 47:40.917
Fine.

47:47.803 --> 47:51.765
This doesn't mean I like you.
Try to screw me on this…

47:52.125 --> 47:53.849
I'll bury you.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
⬄25000÷1000⬄
