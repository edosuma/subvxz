00:03.959 --> 00:05.792
and then, of course,
cement mixer.

00:05.875 --> 00:06.875
That's my favorite.

00:06.959 --> 00:07.875
Mine, too!

00:07.959 --> 00:10.250
Steve, your new friend
Barry is a delight.

00:10.333 --> 00:11.500
Where have you been hiding him?

00:11.583 --> 00:12.792
He's here all the time.

00:12.875 --> 00:14.250
No, no, no, you're thinking
of that other one --

00:14.333 --> 00:16.583
Whatsisname.
Fatman Joe.

00:16.667 --> 00:18.667
Did I miss one
of Barry's stories?

00:18.750 --> 00:19.667
Yes.

00:19.750 --> 00:22.625
Could we rewind the tape a bit
for ol' Francine?

00:22.709 --> 00:24.250
It's, uh, a little rude

00:24.333 --> 00:26.166
to ask someone
to repeat themselves

00:26.250 --> 00:27.917
just because you left the room.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.750
I left the room to get
cashew milk ice cream

00:30.834 --> 00:32.625
because someone
can't handle dairy.

00:34.166 --> 00:35.208
It's me, Barry.

00:35.291 --> 00:37.458
I can't handle
natural milks.

00:37.542 --> 00:39.208
I'm the asshole
she's talking about.

00:39.291 --> 00:40.250
Oh.

00:40.333 --> 00:41.750
On an unrelated point,
Francine,

00:41.834 --> 00:42.834
I wanted to mention

00:42.917 --> 00:44.875
the bathroom faucet
was dripping earlier.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.041
Is there a reason

00:46.125 --> 00:48.458
you never, ever turn
the handle all the way off?

00:48.542 --> 00:50.417
I-I sincerely want to help you
figure this out.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.500
You've had a strand
of Carolina-style pulled pork

00:53.583 --> 00:55.500
stuck in your teeth
since Wednesday.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.333
Maybe figure that out?

00:57.417 --> 00:58.709
Uh-oh.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.458
What, Barry? What's wrong?

01:00.542 --> 01:02.542
The way you guys
are sniping at each other.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.500
It's not good.

01:04.583 --> 01:05.542
This?

01:05.625 --> 01:07.125
Oh, this is normal.

01:07.208 --> 01:08.667
It's married-people stuff.

01:08.750 --> 01:09.667
Isn't it?

01:09.750 --> 01:11.709
No. It's not.

01:11.792 --> 01:12.709
You know, forget it.

01:12.792 --> 01:13.750
It's not my place.

01:13.834 --> 01:17.125
