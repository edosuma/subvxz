00:24.355 --> 00:26.650
- That's not Aya.
- Razer's right.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.437
<i>She doesn't know
what she's doing.</i>

00:28.505 --> 00:31.382
I think she knows
what she's doing, Jordan.

00:31.450 --> 00:33.642
And doesn't care.

Season 1, Episode 21:
<b>"Babel"</b>

00:43.840 --> 00:45.344
That's it.

00:45.373 --> 00:50.994
- Aya's stunt left us high and dry.
- I can see that. And my Ring is under 5%.

00:51.016 --> 00:55.083
- Yeah. I'm near that, too.
- It's a wonder we have any power left...

00:55.099 --> 00:57.187
Ring or otherwise.

00:57.254 --> 00:58.688
How's it look down there?

00:58.709 --> 01:01.625
The main battery is still as dry
as the Sigocean desert.

01:01.653 --> 01:03.235
What was Aya thinking?

01:03.259 --> 01:06.271
She wasn't. At least not
in the way she normally does.

01:06.295 --> 01:09.029
Once you two wizards find a way
to get the Interceptor moving,

01:09.054 --> 01:10.507
we can go find and help her.

01:10.547 --> 01:13.520
All in all, it still
could be worse. Whoa!

01:17.122 --> 01:18.408
And now it is.

01:18.455 --> 01:21.827
We've drifted into a planet's gravity well.
It's pulling us into the atmosphere.

01:21.833 --> 01:26.170
We're in no shape for a crash landing!
And our Rings are too low to abandon ship.

01:26.221 --> 01:29.049
We need to get more power to
the guidance system, so I can land us.

01:29.075 --> 01:32.863
But how?! Are you sure we can't hook up
a personal battery to do that?

01:32.899 --> 01:36.203
I told you, those things are sucked dry.
Nothing but junk now.

01:36.235 --> 01:39.704
- Mine still has a charge.
- Well, do you think we can use it?

01:39.748 --> 01:41.128
Do it!

01:41.746 --> 01:44.730
We will not be getting <i>the Seven
Comet</i> safety rating for this.

01:44.780 --> 01:47.515
It's a plumber's nightmare,
all right, but will it work?

01:47.583 --> 01:51.088
We have no choice but to find out.
Set your personal shields to maximum.

01:52.657 --> 01:55.761
By the way,
if we do explode,

01:55.828 --> 01:59.332
you two are acceptable souls
to be vaporized with.

01:59.399 --> 02:02.087
- Wait... what now?
- No time for good-bye speeches.

02:02.111 --> 02:03.562
Fire up the engine!

02:08.544 --> 02:11.147
We've got power!
Do your planet thing, Jordan.

02:11.214 --> 02:14.483
- Razer, keep that rig running.
- I'll do what I can.

02:21.826 --> 02:24.362
This is like trying
to fly a brick.

02:37.522 --> 02:39.590
Brace for impact!

02:39.948 --> 02:41.845
[grunting]

02:59.259 --> 03:02.589
All right. Any landing
you can walk away from, right?

03:02.632 --> 03:05.508
You say that a lot,
but I don't think it's true.

03:05.576 --> 03:08.579
- Razer, you all right?
- I'm fine.

03:08.646 --> 03:11.082
But my personal battery
looks worse than yours.

03:11.117 --> 03:13.218
I may need to steal a new one.

03:13.904 --> 03:15.698
Oh, great.

03:16.106 --> 03:17.613
Now what?

03:18.256 --> 03:20.479
No biggie. We'll wait
for the main battery to recharge,

03:20.503 --> 03:23.657
power up our Rings and seal
the cracks. Back in business.

03:23.684 --> 03:26.268
The main will take 10 hours
to recharge, Jordan.

03:26.294 --> 03:29.262
So we hang out till then.
I could use a nap.

03:29.534 --> 03:31.402
I don't believe
that would be wise.

03:31.469 --> 03:35.205
This planet's atmosphere is mostly
methane, and it's leaking into the ship.

03:35.273 --> 03:37.883
[cracking]

03:42.559 --> 03:45.616
- There!
- We need to get to that settlement.

03:45.651 --> 03:48.978
We'll use it as a life boat
until the main battery recharges.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.644
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

03:53.687 --> 03:56.251
Whoa!

03:56.629 --> 03:58.963
[all grunting and groaning]

03:59.758 --> 04:02.323
Not enough juice left
for flight.

04:02.354 --> 04:05.690
That citadel is easily
25 kilometers away.

04:05.806 --> 04:08.625
And nothing like a brisk
mid-day run for our lives.

04:08.654 --> 04:10.222

04:24.827 --> 04:27.162

04:27.229 --> 04:29.264
That doesn't even rhyme.

04:29.331 --> 04:31.399
Really? It does,
in my language.

04:31.434 --> 04:35.337
Our Rings just translate other languages.
They can't make 'em rhyme.

04:35.381 --> 04:37.194
Or make them less irritating.

04:37.218 --> 04:38.624
- Who's irritating?
- Who's irritating?

04:38.640 --> 04:42.411
- Anyone wearing green, apparently.
- Well, you're no picnic, either.

04:42.432 --> 04:44.384
Luckily, we're here.

04:49.585 --> 04:52.722
Hal Jordan, Green Lantern
sector 2814.

04:52.789 --> 04:54.857
These are my associates.

05:18.913 --> 05:22.040
Apparently they're not
big fans of the Law around here.

05:22.094 --> 05:25.327
No kidding. Let's think up
a plan before our Rings run out.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.629
Don't you remember anything
from boot camp?

05:27.668 --> 05:30.330
There's a Lantern protocol
for this type of situation,

05:30.357 --> 05:34.278
but it takes precision timing, and
above all, communication and teamwork.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.502
So listen carefully...

06:17.915 --> 06:19.974

06:20.001 --> 06:23.036
Your Rings have no power.
Your translators are offline.

06:23.245 --> 06:25.079
Then how come
I can understand you?

06:25.210 --> 06:27.177

06:27.425 --> 06:29.293
The same reason
you're still breathing.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.017
But I don't have
much power left, either.

06:31.063 --> 06:33.731
So I suggest we find a way
inside that dome.

06:39.270 --> 06:43.172

or just something you threw together?

08:57.095 --> 08:59.590
We need four more hours
until the battery recharges,

08:59.643 --> 09:02.011
then we have to find a way
to get back to the ship.

20:10.345 --> 20:12.920
What have you done to Mother?

20:13.439 --> 20:15.341
Time to go.

20:41.078 --> 20:45.042
Apparently my Lantern battery
was able to recharge itself, after all.

20:45.065 --> 20:47.550
Well, ain't that convenient.

20:47.581 --> 20:52.042
So, it was difficult, but we worked
together despite the obstacles,

20:52.082 --> 20:53.805
like Lanterns are supposed to.

20:53.827 --> 20:56.798
I guess my pep talk hits home
in any language, huh?

20:58.193 --> 21:00.630
- Pep talk?
- The one in the arena.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.889
The big "All for one
and one for all" speech?

21:02.924 --> 21:04.615
You guys got that, right?

21:05.403 --> 21:07.188
Oh, that. Yeah.

21:07.211 --> 21:10.150
- Real inspirational.
- Deeply moving.

21:10.290 --> 21:13.087
Now let's get off this rock
and find Aya.

21:14.936 --> 21:18.238
- Did you understand what he was...
- Not a word.

21:24.177 --> 21:27.177
