>> Dad: Technically, no.
But what i do is...
>> Step one -- remove a slice

12:45.065 --> 12:51.569
from the center of the pizza.
Step two -- eat the pizza slice.
Step three -- push the remaining

12:51.571 --> 12:57.108
halves of the pizza back
together and cover your tracks.
Step four -- put the pizza in

12:57.110 --> 13:00.712

Step five -- enjoy how clever
you are.

13:00.714 --> 13:06.117

wrong, isn't it?!
>> Anais: No, this is a good

We can finally buy all the
things we need.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.513
>> Mom: What do you mean?
We've got everything we need.
>> Anais: Mom, we've all been

13:35.515 --> 13:40.351
wearing the same clothes for the
past year, you three don't even
have any shoes, and i think it's

13:40.353 --> 13:45.356
time Darwin wore some pants.
>> Mom: [ Sighs ]
Wait a minute.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.860
Show me that.
Look at the crack down the
earth.

13:48.862 --> 13:52.530
And your father's eyes.
[ Gasps ]
I've got a bad feeling about

13:52.532 --> 13:55.834

[ Doorbell rings ]
>> Darwin: Are you sure this is
going to work?

15:14.781 --> 15:17.715
Because right now, it kind of
looks like a load of grass and
dirt.

15:17.717 --> 15:23.621
>> Gumball: It just needs some
mozzarella.
There.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.591
>> Oh, finally!
I've been on this Tibetan diet
where you're supposed to eat

15:26.593 --> 15:29.827

been really cloudy.
I think i need to eat something

15:29.829 --> 15:36.567
that actually exists!
Yum! Yum! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
[ Chokes ]

15:36.569 --> 15:47.412

>> Darwin: Dude, i think he's
stopped breathing!

Anais, did you see that?!
>> Anais: See what?

16:04.297 --> 16:07.966
Yeah, i know.
Running water.
Wasn't like that in your day,

16:07.968 --> 16:11.302
huh?
You know, when the world was in
black and white and you could

16:11.304 --> 16:15.673
leave your front door open and
everyone cycled to school on a
bike with one big wheel at the

16:15.675 --> 16:18.710
front.
>> Mom: I don't claim to
understand it, anais, but

16:18.712 --> 16:22.413
something is going wrong --
seriously wrong.
And i think it has to do with

16:22.415 --> 16:25.717
your father.
>> Anais: I think we're gonna
stop with the coffee now.

16:25.719 --> 16:30.588

from Italy, and sometimes has

>> All: ¶ pizza, pizza, pizza! ¶

is the name of the tower that

>> Mom: [ Whimpering ]
>> Anais: Mom, when you say dad

17:37.724 --> 17:42.193
having a job has upset the
fundamental balance of the
universe, are you sure you don't

17:42.195 --> 17:46.464
just mean he's changed the
balance of power in the house
and that upsets you because

17:46.466 --> 17:49.167
you're a little bit of a control
freak?
>> Mom: No.

17:49.169 --> 17:53.805

I don't know anymore.
>> Gumball: [ Humming ]

with your father?
Has something terrible happened?

few pizzas, so we delivered
them.
