00:01.436 --> 00:01.653
.

00:01.697 --> 00:03.699
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:03.742 --> 00:05.135
sexually based offenses

00:05.179 --> 00:06.658
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.704
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.747 --> 00:10.575
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.619 --> 00:12.142
are members of an elite squad

00:12.186 --> 00:14.231
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.059
These are their stories.

00:17.495 --> 00:18.931
- Some guy called 911,

00:18.975 --> 00:20.194
said he was out walking his dog

00:20.237 --> 00:21.934
and saw a dead body.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.414
Turns out he jumped the gun.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.242
Didn't leave a name.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.722
- No, it was one of those
what-do-you-call-its.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.508
- Anyway, someone didn't
like her face much.

00:33.294 --> 00:35.339
- Pulse is low, pupils dilated.

00:35.383 --> 00:36.819
Good news is, she's breathing.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.690
- Nada.

00:38.734 --> 00:41.519
- It's a little cold to be out
without a coat on.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.260
Hold up.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.349
Her stockings are on backwards.

00:45.393 --> 00:47.047
- Maybe she got dressed
in a hurry.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.396
- Maybe she didn't
dress herself.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.702
A hooker's night gone bad?
Maybe a pimp?

00:50.746 --> 00:52.095
- Pimps are rough,
but the girls

00:52.139 --> 00:53.444
are their bread and butter.

00:53.488 --> 00:54.967
They're not gonna
leave her to die.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.186
- So we're looking at a john.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.580
- That's not afraid to kill.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.195
- Multiple contusions.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.284
A few lacerations.
Strangle marks on her neck.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.069
In other words, someone
beat the hell out of her.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.983
- In and out.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.246
- Unclear.

01:12.289 --> 01:13.812
Waiting on a tox screen.

01:13.856 --> 01:16.119
There was extensive trauma
to the genital region.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.555
- Did you go ahead
and do a rape kit?

01:17.599 --> 01:20.167
- No semen, but there was
lubricant from a condom.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.038
- Okay, you mind if we ask her
a few questions?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.692
- Don't push it,
and don't expect much.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.781
- Okay.
We'll tread lightly.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.566
Hi.

01:28.610 --> 01:32.222
I'm Detective Rollins.
This is Detective Tutuola.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.487
- You're the ones
who brought me here.

01:36.531 --> 01:39.577
- We found you
unconscious in an alley.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.453
- Everybody has a name.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.804
- Okay.
And what's yours?

01:48.847 --> 01:52.286
- Sky.
- Keep going.

01:53.809 --> 01:56.028
- It's just Sky.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.729
Where did this happen, Sky?

02:00.772 --> 02:02.252
- We can't help you
unless you talk--

02:02.296 --> 02:04.776
- Maybe I just--
I just want to go home.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.562
- And we just want to
catch the guy who raped you.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.565
- What makes you think
I was raped?

02:10.608 --> 02:12.567
- Okay,
we want to catch the guy

02:12.610 --> 02:15.613
that used your face
as a speed bag.

02:15.657 --> 02:16.745
- I fell down.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.964
- And you--what,
you strangled yourself

02:19.008 --> 02:20.749
on the way down?
Okay.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.278
- We're gonna let you rest
a little bit, Sky,

02:28.322 --> 02:30.889
and maybe later
you'll feel like talking to us.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.806
- Yeah.

02:34.850 --> 02:37.287
Have a good day.

02:47.210 --> 02:54.391
â™ª

03:31.123 --> 03:32.342
- Hey, Lieu.
- Hey.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.430
- So forensics found
a footprint

03:33.474 --> 03:34.518
at the scene of the crime.

03:34.562 --> 03:35.998
It's a men's boot, size 11,

03:36.041 --> 03:37.652
going from the street
to where we found Sky.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.219
- No, not yet.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.482
But the thing is, the print
consisted of a mixture

03:41.525 --> 03:43.135
of tinted cement
and a light-colored,

03:43.179 --> 03:44.659
pebble-sized aggregate.

03:44.702 --> 03:47.139
- All right, so our guy walked
through a sidewalk repair?

03:47.183 --> 03:48.402
- That's what I'm thinking.
- So we could be looking

03:48.445 --> 03:49.751
at the whole damn city.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.622
- Yeah, but Sherlock here
has a theory.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.450
- All right, listen.
It was freezing last night.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.886
The high was 19 degrees,

03:54.930 --> 03:57.149
so I doubt this guy
was working outside.

03:57.193 --> 03:58.803
- So you're thinking
she was assaulted at the hotel

03:58.847 --> 04:00.065
and then moved to the alley?

04:00.109 --> 04:01.284
- Except there was no way

04:01.328 --> 04:02.546
that you get
an unconscious girl

04:02.590 --> 04:04.287
out of a place
like the Peninsula

04:04.331 --> 04:05.375
without anybody noticing.

04:05.419 --> 04:06.811
So I think that at best,

04:06.855 --> 04:08.248
we're looking
for a two-star hotel

04:08.291 --> 04:09.858
that's close to a sidewalk
getting repaired.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.252
Now, that leaves two options.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.558
You got the Abington.
That's 29th and 11th Avenue.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.343
And the Clinton Arms,
46th and 8th.

04:16.386 --> 04:17.344
- Very good.

04:17.387 --> 04:18.867
Okay, Carisi and I

04:18.910 --> 04:20.260
will take the Clinton Arms,

04:20.303 --> 04:22.000
and you two take the other one.

04:23.437 --> 04:25.265
Hey.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.745
You have a problem?

04:27.789 --> 04:29.791
- No.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.537
- I'm sorry about the girl,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.103
but I haven't heard
any complaints

04:38.147 --> 04:39.409
about noise or anything.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.411
- And you don't know
a girl named Sky?

04:41.455 --> 04:42.934
- Sorry.
- Okay.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.110
We're gonna need to check
your security footage.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.938
- Look, I--I don't want to get
in any trouble,

04:46.982 --> 04:48.810
detectives, but to--
to tell you the truth,

04:48.853 --> 04:51.203
the security cameras--
they-re--they're just for show.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.771
- Okay, maybe you could check
your records from last night.

04:53.815 --> 04:57.601
See if anybody checked in
and out for an hour or so.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.734
- Don't you need a warrant
or

04:59.777 --> 05:02.258
- Not unless you're the one
that did the beating.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
Maybe I should call a lawyer.

05:04.347 --> 05:07.089
- Now you're starting to look
real suspicious.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.613
Well, I suppose

05:09.657 --> 05:11.136
you could take a look...
- Yeah.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.138
- Without me noticing.
- Yeah, cool.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.358
Bring your eyes over here.
Look this way.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.534
Look at me.

05:18.492 --> 05:19.797
- I'm guessing
you don't check IDs.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.973
We got Mickey Mouse
in room 212,

05:22.017 --> 05:24.672
Elvis in 117.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.891
- You were gonna make us
get a warrant for that?

05:26.935 --> 05:29.590
- Hey, Grigor.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.200
This

05:31.243 --> 05:32.810
- It was turned in.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.726
- Condoms, lube, mouthwash.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.119
- Put your hands
behind your back.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.599
- Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

05:38.642 --> 05:39.600
All right, all right,
all right.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.036
There were three guys.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.430
They went running out,
and--and I went to--

05:43.473 --> 05:46.389
to see what was going on,
and--and that's when I saw her.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.043
- 117.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.960
- I knew it was Elvis.

05:56.181 --> 06:00.534
- Look, I--I'm sorry the maid
hasn't tidied up yet.

06:00.577 --> 06:02.231
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:02.274 --> 06:05.756
Right there, on the floor.
She was dead.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.975
- So why didn't you call
the police?

06:07.018 --> 06:08.106
- No, I did!

06:08.150 --> 06:09.325
- After you dumped her
in the street

06:09.369 --> 06:10.326
like a piece of trash.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.675
- Cops all over the place

06:11.719 --> 06:13.329
ain't exactly good
for business, no offense.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.026
I mean, the girl's dead.

06:15.070 --> 06:16.419
You know, who's it gonna hurt?

06:16.463 --> 06:18.029
- Except she's not dead.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.466
- That's...

06:19.509 --> 06:20.858
She's not dead?

06:20.902 --> 06:22.686
- No, and you endangered
an impaired person.

06:22.730 --> 06:23.818
That's a felony.
- Which means

06:23.861 --> 06:25.210
you're under arrest, dumbass.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.387
- Wait, wait, wait.
That--I was--

06:27.430 --> 06:29.519
No, you don't...
Ah, come on!

06:29.563 --> 06:31.695
- Vitals have stabilized.
Swelling has come down a bit.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.871
So she's gonna make
a full recovery.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.484
She was just here.

06:37.527 --> 06:40.182
Joyce, did she say
anything to you?

06:41.183 --> 06:43.707
- Looks to me
like she checked herself out.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.455
- New York's finest,
meet "New York's finest."

06:52.499 --> 06:53.804
- Yeah, something like that.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.545
I just don't figure Sky
for a street walker.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.636
- From the picture, it looks
like she has all her teeth.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.727
- I've been here, what,
seven years?

07:03.771 --> 07:04.989
I still don't get it.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.469
- World's oldest profession,
my friend.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.776
- I understand
why there are hookers, Carisi.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.386
I just don't get
why we give a damn.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.736
They--they know the risks.

07:12.780 --> 07:13.998
- Maybe they don't have
a choice.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.435
- Everybody's got a choice.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.001
Besides, there are plenty
of women out there

07:17.045 --> 07:18.568
who need our help,
and more importantly,

07:18.612 --> 07:19.961
want it.

07:22.485 --> 07:23.660
- Hold on, here we go.

07:23.704 --> 07:26.924
"Sky.
I will blow your mind."

07:26.968 --> 07:29.666
- Among other things.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.016
- Yeah.
Without the swollen eye.

07:32.060 --> 07:35.063
SkysTheLimitXXX.com.
It's classy.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.114
-She's late.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.769
- Come on, a player like you,
how could she stay away?

07:47.075 --> 07:50.382
- I think one of her colleagues
just got here.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.994
- Saving New York,
one hooker at a time.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.562
- I think they prefer
"sex worker."

07:55.605 --> 07:57.781
- Eh, if the shoe fits.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.178
Hey, you're on, Carisi.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.272
- Ooh,
you've got to be Sky.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.579
- Hey, sexy,
you must be Dominick.

08:12.622 --> 08:13.928
You get a room?

08:13.971 --> 08:15.886
- Well, I figured
we talk a little first...

08:15.930 --> 08:17.192
- It's your hour.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.934
- Down at the station.
- Damn it.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.980
- Hey.
Remember me?

08:23.024 --> 08:25.069
- Yeah.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.723
Whether you know it or not,
we're trying to help you.

08:34.688 --> 08:34.862
.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.994
- I never asked
to press charges.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.082
- That's not the way it works.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.344
- I don't know anything.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.345
- Now,
how can I believe anything

08:40.389 --> 08:41.738
if I can't see your eyes?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.396
That happen often?
- I get paid for this.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.919
You get paid to pretend
to worry about it,

08:48.963 --> 08:50.355
and the world goes round.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.574
- Speak for yourself.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.880
- Everybody's pretending.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.229
That's the way this works.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.100
I get paid to pretend
I enjoy my work.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.538
You get paid to pretend
you think yours is important.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.757
- You know what, you've wasted
enough of my time.

09:00.801 --> 09:03.281
How about you tell me
who smacked you around?

09:04.239 --> 09:05.719
- I forgot.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.983
- I could care less
what happened to you.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.288
To me, you're about, what,

09:10.332 --> 09:13.161
110 pounds of wasted skin
and lipstick.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.858
- All right--
- No, no. No, no.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.643
Hey, how much would it take
for you to just give me a name?

09:16.686 --> 09:18.122
30 bucks? I bet you'd let me
break your nose.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.428
- That's enough.
Sorry, green

09:19.471 --> 09:20.560
is the only language she knows.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.692
- Yeah, I'll take it from here.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.433
Detective.

09:27.741 --> 09:30.395
- I am so sorry.

09:30.439 --> 09:34.835
I apologize for
Detective Rollins' attitude.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.706
- Yeah, she's a real bitch,
with a capital C.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.361
- Listen, I'm--
I'm Olivia Benson,

09:39.404 --> 09:40.971
and I am the lieutenant here.

09:47.151 --> 09:50.241
So, Sky...

09:50.285 --> 09:52.853
three guys, one girl?

09:52.896 --> 09:54.594
You didn't stand a chance.

09:58.989 --> 10:01.296
I knew I couldn't trust him.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.081
- Sounds like you don't trust
a lot of people.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.257
- People are scum.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.563
- Yeah, some of them are,

10:07.607 --> 10:10.131
but in my experience, most--

10:10.174 --> 10:12.655
- Oh, do not tell me
they're good.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.962
- Okay.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.399
They're not all scum.

10:23.274 --> 10:26.974
I believe this belongs to you.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.759
- Thanks.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.893
- Well, it's the least
I could do for you, Sky.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.290
- Sandy.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.684
That's my name.
Sandy Ksenivich.

10:41.728 --> 10:46.515
You know, sand between my toes,
eyes in the sky.

10:46.558 --> 10:49.649
Hence, Sky.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.347
- It's clever.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.656
- Guy who called
said his name was Gus,

10:56.699 --> 10:58.919
but that's probably bogus.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.314
- Okay.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.838
Tell me,

11:04.881 --> 11:08.015
what do you remember
about them?

11:08.058 --> 11:11.758
There's no detail too small.

11:11.801 --> 11:13.585
Anything?

11:15.718 --> 11:17.807
- Uh, they had short hair.

11:19.722 --> 11:22.290
No hair.
- Okay.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.554
- One of them was young.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.687
- Maybe 20.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.253
It was his first time.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.865
He was sweet, actually.

11:31.908 --> 11:35.956
"Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am."

11:35.999 --> 11:37.522
He was supposed to be
the only one.

11:37.566 --> 11:40.351
It was the second guy
who hit me.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.179
He was old, like...

11:42.223 --> 11:44.181
40.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.966
Uh...

11:46.009 --> 11:49.186
He wanted a freebie.
I said no way.

11:49.230 --> 11:53.582
That's when he hit me
and forced me to...

11:57.281 --> 11:58.892
- Sounds like rape.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.197
Lieutenant's pretty good
at this.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.982
- After I teed it up for her.

12:02.025 --> 12:05.028
- You were pretty convincing
in there.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.726
You okay?

12:12.340 --> 12:15.125
- When he was done, he left,

12:15.169 --> 12:17.562
and the third guy came in.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.957
I hit him with a lamp,
he started bleeding,

12:21.001 --> 12:23.177
and that's when grandpa
came back

12:23.220 --> 12:25.135
and beat the crap out of me.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.923
- Sky...

12:29.966 --> 12:33.056
I just want to tell you
that I am...

12:33.100 --> 12:37.147
very sorry that
that happened to you.

12:40.324 --> 12:41.761
- Right.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.110
The joke's on them.

12:43.153 --> 12:44.894
The nervous virgin
left his money clip

12:44.938 --> 12:49.072
on the nightstand before
any of the drama went down.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.206
- I earned it.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.690
- U.S. Army.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.443
- March!

13:12.487 --> 13:14.358
Second squad, forward!

13:14.402 --> 13:16.621
- I'm not happy about this.
- Well, think of it like this.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.188
We're not investigating
the army.

13:18.232 --> 13:21.148
We're looking for a rapist.
- First squad, forward!

13:21.191 --> 13:22.802
- A lot of these guys
look alike.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.587
- But only one got hit
in the head with a lamp.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.937
We need to know if anybody
came in for stitches

13:27.981 --> 13:30.679
in the head on Saturday night
or early Sunday morning.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.246
- I'm not sure if I'm allowed
to disclose

13:32.289 --> 13:33.247
personal medical records.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.816
It says NYPD.
You know what that means?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.774
- Please excuse
my impertinent colleague.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.863
I'm sure you're aware that
the city has an arrangement

13:40.907 --> 13:43.910
made with the local Army bases.

13:43.953 --> 13:46.086
Yeah, they're willing to open
their files to us

13:46.129 --> 13:48.523
on any alleged crimes
committed off base.

13:48.566 --> 13:49.959
- You know what,
don't trouble yourself.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.613
We'll just go back
to your base commander,

13:51.656 --> 13:53.571
tell him that you refused
to help us.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.573
I'm sure he's gonna love
seeing us again.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.320
- Sergeant Jim Preston.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.235
Said he got cut in the gym.

14:05.279 --> 14:08.151
- Does the computer say
where he is right now?

14:08.195 --> 14:10.675
- He's with
the 303rd Infantry Brigade.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.330
That's on the east side
of the base.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.897
- Let's go!
Let's go!

14:14.941 --> 14:16.507
Shaughnessy, bring it in tight.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.728
- Busy here.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.122
- Detective Tutuola, NYPD.

14:22.165 --> 14:24.733
We need to talk to you
about Saturday night.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.871
- Not here.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.177
Not in front of my soldiers.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.787
Run it again.

14:35.831 --> 14:39.182
Back to Sector Tango.
Now! Move!

14:47.190 --> 14:47.408
.

14:47.451 --> 14:50.019
- Hey, boss.
We'll take it from here.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.368
- Mr. Preston.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.196
Is it all right
if I call you Jim?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.894
- Sure.
- All right.

14:54.937 --> 14:58.506
What can you tell me about
what happened Saturday night?

14:58.549 --> 15:01.161
You were at the Abington Hotel,
room 117,

15:01.204 --> 15:04.207
with a prostitute
named Sky, right?

15:04.251 --> 15:05.992
- James Preston.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.472
Sergeant.
United States Army.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.475
ID number
1-2-0-1-9-0-1-0.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.608
- Okay.
Got that.

15:13.651 --> 15:16.132
You want to tell me
anything else?

15:16.176 --> 15:17.438
- James Preston.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.353
Sergeant.
United States Army.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.747
ID number 1-2-0-1-9-0-1-0.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.228
- Name, rank, and ID number.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.230
- Did Carisi explain
we're not gonna torture him?

15:27.274 --> 15:28.579
- This guy wouldn't talk
even if we did.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.277
- Yeah, maybe his buddy will.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.148
I checked the base logs.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.758
Jim clocked back in on the base

15:33.802 --> 15:35.978
with a Private
William Shaughnessy.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.459
- Okay.
What do we do with him?

15:38.502 --> 15:41.810
- Let him sweat.
It's good practice.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.117
- This is a whole lot of work
for a whole lot of nothing.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.554
Go home.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.121
Back of the formation.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.949
- Private William Shaughnessy.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.254
- I'm Private Shaughnessy.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.213
- We want to talk to you.
We're NYPD.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.519
We want to talk to you
about Saturday night.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.260
- Okay.
What's up?

15:59.175 --> 16:01.047
- Yeah.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.439
- No one.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.354
- Well, the log says
you returned to base

16:04.398 --> 16:05.877
with Sergeant Jim Preston.

16:05.921 --> 16:07.183
- Yeah, we clocked back
around the same time,

16:07.227 --> 16:08.619
but we weren't together.

16:08.663 --> 16:11.971
- You didn't hook up
with a prostitute named Sky?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.973
- I...I don't know.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.758
- She's claiming she was raped
on Saturday night,

16:16.801 --> 16:19.152
and all the evidence points
to you or your buddies

16:19.195 --> 16:20.675
or all of the above.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.329
- Which means right now
is your chance to tell us

16:22.372 --> 16:24.287
your side of the story.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.161
- Hey, bud,

16:28.204 --> 16:32.730
rape one carries a sentence
of 25 years in prison.

16:34.732 --> 16:37.300
- It was me.
I raped her.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.957
- You're admitting to raping
and beating her?

16:43.263 --> 16:45.395
- Yeah.

16:46.222 --> 16:48.181
- Okay.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.835
- Then...
you're under arrest.

16:59.409 --> 17:01.672
- Number three
is Billy Shaughnessy.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.066
He's confessed
to raping and beating you.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.418
He didn't do anything bad
to me.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.726
- Looks like he's willing
to go down for his friends.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.336
- He's one of
those trustworthy people

17:13.380 --> 17:15.382
you were talking about.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.732
They really do exist.

17:17.775 --> 17:20.735
- Yeah. You offer absolution
in your spare time?

17:20.778 --> 17:23.694
- No, no, that's--
that's above my pay grade.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.088
But, um...

17:26.132 --> 17:30.005
but I can offer some solace,
and...

17:30.049 --> 17:31.398
some hope.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.923
- Because it matters.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.491
Because you matter.

17:37.534 --> 17:41.408
And what happened
to you matters.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.324
I'll tell you
what doesn't matter

17:44.367 --> 17:47.327
is why you were in
that hotel that night.

17:48.415 --> 17:52.114
- That I get paid to have sex.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.595
- My priority

17:54.638 --> 17:58.251
is putting away the person
who did this to you.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.427
But I need your help.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.476
- You will.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.001
- Eh...

18:10.045 --> 18:13.048
people looking at me,
judging me...

18:16.617 --> 18:20.795
The only opinion
that matters...

18:20.838 --> 18:23.493
is yours.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.501
- Look at the pictures, Sandy.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.646
- The last person
to call me Sandy was my mom.

18:45.689 --> 18:48.301
She, uh, passed away
a few years ago,

18:48.344 --> 18:51.173
some kind of brain thing,
but...

18:51.217 --> 18:52.740
I went to see her in hospice.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.655
She didn't know who I was,

18:54.698 --> 18:57.788
but as I was leaving,
she whispered, "Sandy."

18:59.225 --> 19:01.879
And then she died.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.582
Let me see these.

19:19.419 --> 19:22.726
That's the guy I hit
with the lamp.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.729
- Okay.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.166
Keep going.

19:36.784 --> 19:41.049
- And that's the bastard
who beat me up and raped me.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.184
- Staff Sergeant Tyler Jones.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.011
- You got her to talk.
- Well, it only takes time.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.491
- I'm sure it took
more than that.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.189
Look, I feel for her,
Lieutenant.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.713
I do, and I want a conviction
as much as you,

19:52.756 --> 19:55.324
but the fact is, to a jury,
her word won't be enough.

19:55.368 --> 19:59.676
- Listen, in a rape case,
a victim's ID goes a long way.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.289
- No.

20:03.332 --> 20:05.073
- No, but we do have
fingerprints.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.683
- That's right.

20:06.727 --> 20:07.989
- Along with, I'm guessing,
a thousand other

20:08.032 --> 20:09.730
sets of prints
and God knows what else.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.166
Look, I'm not trying
to be a hardass,

20:11.210 --> 20:13.342
but we need some kind
of corroboration.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.604
And the bottom line?

20:14.648 --> 20:16.389
If we want to nail
this bastard,

20:16.432 --> 20:17.955
one of his buddies has to rat.

20:24.788 --> 20:27.008
- I said all I'm gonna say.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.793
- Name, rank, and ID.
- That's it.

20:29.837 --> 20:32.622
- Ratting out your superior
isn't an easy thing.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.582
I was a ranger.
I get it.

20:35.625 --> 20:37.279
- You don't get it.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.368
- And you don't listen.

20:39.412 --> 20:41.370
Come on.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.676
I remember what it was like.

20:42.719 --> 20:45.766
Get a couple days off
to uncork.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.507
Throw a few dollars
at some ass.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.465
You can talk to me, James.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.598
I've seen things.
I've done things too.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.426
The good thing is,
this girl doesn't remember

20:53.469 --> 20:55.297
you doing anything to her.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.299
You could walk on this.

20:57.343 --> 20:58.779
- James Preston.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.303
Sergeant.
United States Army.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.914
ID number 1-2-0-1-9-0--

21:03.958 --> 21:05.438
- Then on the other hand,

21:05.481 --> 21:07.527
your blood is on the lamp.

21:07.570 --> 21:10.269
As soon as the lab returns
with the tests,

21:10.312 --> 21:12.096
we put you in that room.

21:17.188 --> 21:19.843
- I was there,
but I didn't do anything.

21:19.887 --> 21:22.846
I didn't rape her.

21:26.154 --> 21:28.852
Okay.
I'm thinking you did.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.854
Turn around and put your hands
behind your back.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.076
- I told you, I did it.

21:35.119 --> 21:37.252
I raped her.
- We both know that's not true.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.646
We both know that it was
Staff Sergeant Tyler Jones.

21:39.689 --> 21:42.257
- He's an upstanding soldier.
- Right...

21:45.216 --> 21:47.001
You know that night with Sky--

21:47.044 --> 21:49.177
that was your first time,
wasn't it?

21:49.220 --> 21:51.701
Hell no.

21:51.745 --> 21:54.704
- She told us you were
sweet and gentle.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.189
You like her.

22:02.712 --> 22:03.931
Your heart beats
a little faster

22:03.974 --> 22:06.020
when you think about her, hmm?

22:07.717 --> 22:10.067
What's your heart do when you--

22:10.111 --> 22:12.505
when you look at that?

22:12.548 --> 22:13.984
She was good to you, Billy,

22:14.028 --> 22:17.205
and that's what that
upstanding soldier did to her.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.860
And I know you guys live
by some sort of code.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.601
Wasn't that code violated
the second

22:21.644 --> 22:24.778
Staff Sergeant Jones's fist
hit her face?

22:24.821 --> 22:26.257
Okay, and--and who knows
what Jim did to her,

22:26.301 --> 22:30.087
enough for her to make her
swing a lamp at his head.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.268
You're the only one
that can help her, Billy.

22:42.099 --> 22:43.840
- Fine.

22:45.276 --> 22:47.801
I'll do it.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.589
- Good man.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.728
- Staff Sergeant.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.427
- I'm the guy
arresting you for rape.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.168
Put your hands
behind your back.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.128
Let's go.

23:15.437 --> 23:15.611
.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.439
- Rape in the first degree

23:17.483 --> 23:19.093
and assault
in the first degree.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.704
Ah.
The few, the proud.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.793
- Due respect, Your Honor,
that's marines.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.186
These men are army.

23:25.229 --> 23:29.233
- Ah, my bad.
Uh, let's hear some pleas.

23:31.714 --> 23:35.065
- Not guilty.
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

23:35.109 --> 23:36.937
- All right, what do we have
for bail, Mr. Stone?

23:36.980 --> 23:38.068
- Remand, Your Honor.

23:38.112 --> 23:39.330
The defendants are active duty,

23:39.374 --> 23:40.462
and geographic reshuffling

23:40.506 --> 23:41.550
isn't out of the question.

23:41.594 --> 23:42.899
- Oh, please, the army wants

23:42.943 --> 23:44.466
the names of these fine men
cleared

23:44.510 --> 23:45.772
as soon as possible.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.730
- Can I get
defense counsels' word

23:47.774 --> 23:50.341
that this court will be given
48 hours written notice

23:50.385 --> 23:51.995
before these men
are transferred?

23:52.039 --> 23:53.170
- Yes, Your Honor.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.650
- In that case,
these defendants

23:54.694 --> 23:57.914
will be held on $50,000 bail,
cash or bond.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.960
And I am off to lunch.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.180
- Peter.

24:03.224 --> 24:04.399
- You are a long way
from Chicago.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.792
- Well, representing
our fighting men

24:05.835 --> 24:07.228
is a moveable feast.

24:07.271 --> 24:08.621
Interesting case
we've got here.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.579
The word of a lying
lady of the night

24:10.623 --> 24:12.451
against two decorated soldiers.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.104
- Save your breath.
No deals.

24:14.148 --> 24:17.325
- She's a hooker, Peter.
- And your client's a rapist.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.200
- The older one.
- Staff Sergeant Tyler Jones.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.854
- That's right.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.422
He said Billy had only been
with me a couple of minutes.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.119
He said I owed him
for the rest of the money.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.861
I said the deal was for one
of them, that's it.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.387
- He punched me in the face.

24:36.431 --> 24:39.173
He threw me on the bed,
and then he held me down

24:39.216 --> 24:41.349
while he raped me.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.050
- When he was done,
the other one came in.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.403
- Yeah, uh...

24:52.447 --> 24:54.101
I wasn't about to put up
with another one,

24:54.144 --> 24:55.755
so I hit him with a lamp.

24:55.798 --> 24:59.062
That's when Tyler Jones
came in again

24:59.106 --> 25:01.717
and beat the hell out of me.

25:01.761 --> 25:04.633
He strangled me
until I passed out.

25:04.677 --> 25:07.157
And then I--I don't know
what happened to me.

25:07.201 --> 25:10.291
The next thing I remember is
waking up in the hospital.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.641
- Thank you, Ms. Ksenivich.

25:15.644 --> 25:18.473
- This was just
a business transaction?

25:18.517 --> 25:19.779
- Until it wasn't.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.215
- Have you ever
come across a client

25:21.258 --> 25:23.609
that likes it a little rough?

25:23.652 --> 25:25.219
- They have to tell me upfront.

25:27.917 --> 25:28.962
- I walk out.

25:29.005 --> 25:31.094
- I see,
you're a sensitive hooker--

25:31.138 --> 25:32.269
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.445
So if a client says,

25:34.489 --> 25:37.448
"I'd like to give you
a little pat on the butt."

25:37.492 --> 25:38.928
You turn him down?

25:38.972 --> 25:40.800
- No, as long as it doesn't
get out of hand.

25:40.843 --> 25:42.671
- So if a client gets
a little carried away,

25:42.715 --> 25:45.413
and a pat turns into a slap?

25:47.328 --> 25:49.722
- Mostly, it's okay.

25:49.765 --> 25:52.115
- So it's all a question
of degree?

25:52.159 --> 25:53.595
- Sure.

25:53.639 --> 25:57.338
- So it's normal
business practice to get hit?

25:57.381 --> 25:59.122
- Objection.
- There's a certain degree

25:59.166 --> 26:00.820
of brutality that is expected

26:00.863 --> 26:03.736
in Ms. Ksenivich's
chosen field of endeavor.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.042
And that exact degree
of such brutality

26:06.086 --> 26:07.696
is one of the many items

26:07.740 --> 26:09.872
that both parties
need to negotiate.

26:09.916 --> 26:13.006
- Your Honor.
- That's enough, Mr. Olson.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.574
- I have nothing else.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.011
- The guys made fun of me

26:18.054 --> 26:20.361
because I'd never been
with a woman.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.320
Staff Sergeant Jones, he said

26:23.364 --> 26:25.627
he was gonna put an end
to that.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.455
It's why we came to the city
that night.

26:29.457 --> 26:31.328
- Staff Sergeant found her
on the internet.

26:31.372 --> 26:32.721
He arranged the whole thing.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.681
- Tell us what happened
once you got to the hotel.

26:35.724 --> 26:37.291
- Staff Sergeant and Jimmy

26:37.334 --> 26:39.423
waited in the other room
while...

26:41.382 --> 26:43.602
I had sex.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.786
- We went back to base.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.012
- Did Staff Sergeant Jones
go in the bedroom

27:03.056 --> 27:04.840
with Ms. Ksenivich?

27:08.322 --> 27:09.715
No.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.631
I was done,
so we went home.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.893
- I'd like to read to you

27:13.936 --> 27:15.721
your testimony
from the grand jury.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.636
- You don't need to read that.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.249
I was lying back then.
I just wanted to get you

27:22.292 --> 27:24.904
and the damn cops off my back.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.870
- It's called perjury, Billy,

27:34.914 --> 27:36.393
and believe me,
I will prosecute.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.656
- They yell at me.
You yell at me.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.135
Why does everybody
have to yell at me?

27:39.179 --> 27:40.702
- That's gonna be the least
of your problems

27:40.746 --> 27:41.703
when you end up in prison.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.487
- They already told me!

27:43.531 --> 27:45.228
There's no way the jury
is gonna believe Sky

27:45.272 --> 27:46.752
over the Staff Sergeant.

27:48.754 --> 27:51.234
That means you lose, Mr. Stone.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.455
- And if you're convicted
in a military court

27:54.498 --> 27:56.457
of making unsubstantiated
allegations

27:56.500 --> 27:58.720
against a superior officer,

27:58.764 --> 28:00.766
you end up in Leavenworth.

28:04.465 --> 28:07.120
- I just wanted a woman.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.472
I wanted to be a man.

28:14.649 --> 28:19.872
I'd rather be a criminal,
Mr. Stone, than a traitor.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.483
Can I go?

28:28.707 --> 28:30.273
Just like that?

28:30.317 --> 28:32.449
- There's nothing we could
have said to convince him.

28:32.493 --> 28:35.278
- He has a beating heart.
He has a conscience.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.019
- Which isn't going
to get in the way of a loyalty

28:37.063 --> 28:39.195
that goes back 250 years.
We'll never break him.

28:39.239 --> 28:42.546
- So because he's a good man,
he's gonna do the wrong thing?

28:42.590 --> 28:43.983
- Our only hope

28:44.026 --> 28:46.725
is that Jim isn't
as good a man as Billy is.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.299
- You people.

28:56.343 --> 28:58.214
You all got some balls on you.

28:58.258 --> 29:01.522
- Unforeseeable things
happen in a trial.

29:01.565 --> 29:02.653
It's just the way it is.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.699
- I said
I didn't want to do this.

29:04.743 --> 29:05.700
I said leave it alone--

29:11.532 --> 29:13.316
You missed a couple days' work,
right?

29:13.360 --> 29:16.450
You know what, I can--
I can make that up to you, Sky.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.669
- It's Sandy.

29:18.713 --> 29:19.975
- Yeah, you're--

29:20.019 --> 29:21.890
you're always gonna be Sky
to me.

29:21.934 --> 29:25.415
What is it, 200, 300?
Here.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.117
- Yeah, it is.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.519
- You know, every morning,
I get up,

29:42.563 --> 29:43.694
look myself in the mirror.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.261
You know what I see?

29:47.307 --> 29:50.310
Not a damn thing.

29:50.353 --> 29:52.878
I'm invisible.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.836
Nothing.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.751
But after you people started
with me,

29:56.795 --> 29:58.448
when I looked in the mirror,
I began to see

29:58.492 --> 30:01.060
a piece of someone
looking back at me.

30:02.539 --> 30:05.455
You know, it felt good.

30:05.499 --> 30:06.892
But now,

30:06.935 --> 30:11.679
after being humiliated
like that in court,

30:11.722 --> 30:14.900
that little piece of pride,
or self-worth,

30:14.943 --> 30:18.120
or whatever it is you gave me

30:18.164 --> 30:22.168
is gone,
and it's never coming back.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.694
Here.

30:28.435 --> 30:30.872
Keep your money.

30:37.792 --> 30:38.967
- Sometimes this job--

30:39.011 --> 30:41.752
And life

30:41.796 --> 30:43.189
- Yeah, no, more like, uh,

30:43.232 --> 30:45.669
makes you want to pound
a fifth of Jameson.

30:45.713 --> 30:47.976
- We don't get to pick
and choose our victims.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.935
- I know.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.426
- Yeah.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.302
- I'll get over it.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.088
- Okay.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.744
Well, whatever it is, let's--

31:16.787 --> 31:19.312
let's not take it out
on Sandy.

31:22.445 --> 31:23.838
- I don't know why I'm here.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.492
I told the other guy,
I've got nothing to say.

31:25.535 --> 31:28.016
- You're willing to go
to prison for 25 years

31:28.060 --> 31:29.931
because your commanding officer
made a stupid--

31:29.975 --> 31:31.802
no, a sick decision?

31:33.152 --> 31:35.458
- Misdemeanor assault.
He pays a fine.

31:35.502 --> 31:37.460
- Look, we're trying
to help you.

31:37.504 --> 31:40.333
We know that you didn't
hurt Sandy Ksenivich.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.769
- You can let me go,

31:41.812 --> 31:43.684
you can pin a couple medals
on my chest

31:43.727 --> 31:44.946
and bump me up in rank,

31:44.990 --> 31:48.428
and my answer is still no deal.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.388
I think both of you
are gonna want to hear this.

31:54.347 --> 31:55.957
Lieutenant, you guys
are wasting your time.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.350
Jim Preston
is never gonna testify.

31:57.393 --> 31:58.960
- We just got to break
this damn military code.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.875
- It's got nothing to do
with any code.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.921
We just got the blood back
from the lab tests,

32:02.964 --> 32:04.487
and it's a match for Jim,

32:04.531 --> 32:07.969
but the DNA in the blood
is genetically female.

32:12.756 --> 32:14.976
Jim Preston is
a transgender man.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.025
- Well...

32:20.068 --> 32:22.114
that's why he won't testify.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.854
- The courts
will never uphold any law

32:23.898 --> 32:25.726
against transgender people
serving in the military.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.033
- That's right,
but there's a huge distance

32:28.076 --> 32:31.036
between the law and life.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.353
- Okay, here's the deal.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.007
As of this moment,
all charges against you

32:46.051 --> 32:47.530
are dropped with prejudice.

32:47.574 --> 32:49.750
In exchange, I expect you
to willingly testify

32:49.793 --> 32:51.360
against Staff Sergeant Jones.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.929
Now get out.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.287
If you refuse,
you will be subpoenaed,

33:05.331 --> 33:07.028
and failure to appear
will be met

33:07.072 --> 33:09.291
with the strictest punishment
the law allows.

33:15.123 --> 33:18.170
- You'll ruin his life,
if he testifies.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.868
- And if he doesn't,
you'll ruin Sandy's.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.478
It's your choice.

33:35.622 --> 33:35.839
.

33:35.883 --> 33:38.059
- Man, what is with
you people?

33:38.103 --> 33:40.192
- I'm just trying to get
something done here.

33:42.629 --> 33:43.760
- It's a little chilly
out here.

33:43.804 --> 33:46.024
Do you mind if I join you?

33:57.078 --> 33:58.775
- Thank you.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.867
- I didn't do anything,
Lieutenant.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.174
I didn't touch her.
- I know that, Jim.

34:08.307 --> 34:11.440
I know.

34:13.616 --> 34:16.967
I bet when you enlisted,
you were in high school.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.405
- College.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.885
- You could have done anything
with your life,

34:21.929 --> 34:24.932
and you chose
to serve your country.

34:24.975 --> 34:27.674
- And if I testify,
my country will attack me.

34:27.717 --> 34:28.936
- Not your country.

34:28.979 --> 34:31.591
Some closed-minded people
who work for--

34:31.634 --> 34:33.984
- A difference
without a distinction.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.119
I'd like to help you
put Staff Sergeant in prison,

34:38.163 --> 34:40.078
but if I do,
I'll be putting myself

34:40.121 --> 34:41.818
in a prison
of my own making.

34:41.862 --> 34:44.256
- Kind of like the one
you're in now?

34:44.299 --> 34:47.389
You're worried how your fellow
soldiers will see you?

34:47.433 --> 34:49.478
- I'm so far beyond that.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.045
The least of my worries

34:51.089 --> 34:53.134
is having people laughing at me
behind my back,

34:53.178 --> 34:55.571
craning to get a look
at me in the shower.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.356
But once I'm outed
to officials,

34:57.399 --> 34:59.880
there's no going back in.

34:59.923 --> 35:03.231
And by the stroke of a tweet
sent from Air Force One,

35:03.275 --> 35:05.451
I could lose my job.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.756
My career.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.498
Everything I've ever
worked for.

35:12.762 --> 35:16.157
- I know that things feel...

35:16.201 --> 35:18.203
uncertain.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.813
But do you get any comfort

35:19.856 --> 35:23.208
knowing that that tweet
did not become a law?

35:23.251 --> 35:24.687
- Today maybe.

35:24.731 --> 35:26.776
What about tomorrow?

35:28.082 --> 35:30.345
I don't know
what's gonna happen.

35:30.389 --> 35:32.565
Do you?

35:32.608 --> 35:34.654
- No, I don't.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.525
- Look at me!

35:37.613 --> 35:40.050
I'm a soldier, Lieutenant.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.661
A damn good soldier.

35:41.704 --> 35:45.708
I couldn't stand being
stuck behind a desk.

35:48.581 --> 35:50.757
I love what I do.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.716
This job is who I am.

35:57.067 --> 35:59.679
- Do you have any family
in the military?

35:59.722 --> 36:03.073
- No.

36:03.117 --> 36:05.206
- Just the ones I made
after I enlisted.

36:05.250 --> 36:09.993
- So when you enlisted,
you were just being a patriot?

36:10.037 --> 36:12.605
You just wanted to help people.

36:12.648 --> 36:16.739
In fact, you couldn't imagine
not helping people.

36:17.523 --> 36:20.743
Believe me, I get it.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.705
- I enlisted
to serve my country.

36:25.748 --> 36:29.839
- Then serve its people.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.545
- Tyler and I sat outside

36:39.588 --> 36:41.895
while Billy was in the bedroom
with Sky.

36:41.938 --> 36:44.376
When he came out, Tyler
went in and closed the door.

36:44.419 --> 36:47.030
- I heard Sky scream.

36:47.074 --> 36:49.511
- Definitely not.

36:49.555 --> 36:50.860
But then it got quiet.

36:50.904 --> 36:53.385
Maybe ten minutes later,
Tyler came out.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.561
I saw Sky sitting on the foot
of the bed,

36:55.604 --> 36:57.519
crying, holding her face.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.393
- Tyler pushed me
into the room with her

37:01.436 --> 37:02.916
and slammed the door closed.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.874
He thought I wanted
to have sex with her.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.399
- No.

37:07.442 --> 37:08.661
But Sky didn't know it.

37:08.704 --> 37:09.923
She hit me in the head
with a lamp.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.272
I needed five stitches.

37:11.316 --> 37:14.144
- What, if anything,
did Staff Sergeant Jones do?

37:14.188 --> 37:16.756
- I guess he heard
the lamp break or me scream.

37:16.799 --> 37:18.801
The next thing I knew,
he was in the bedroom,

37:18.845 --> 37:19.933
physically assaulting her.

37:21.456 --> 37:22.979
- That's right.

37:23.023 --> 37:25.504
When he started strangling her,
I pulled him away,

37:25.547 --> 37:27.245
and we all left.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.773
- Objection!

37:33.816 --> 37:35.078
- The witness just testified

37:35.122 --> 37:37.037
that unlike
most red-blooded men,

37:37.080 --> 37:39.953
he didn't want to have sex
with a beautiful woman.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.650
I'd like to know why.

37:41.694 --> 37:43.043
- Overruled.

37:44.871 --> 37:47.003
- No.

37:47.047 --> 37:49.310
- No.

37:49.354 --> 37:52.008
- Objection.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.324
- I'm a transgender man.

38:05.457 --> 38:08.024
I believe that's what
you were getting at, Counselor.

38:08.068 --> 38:10.113
You could have just asked me.

38:10.157 --> 38:11.985
And because
you're so interested,

38:12.028 --> 38:15.205
I'm physically able to have sex
with whoever I want.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.645
- So you're saying
you were once a woman?

38:19.688 --> 38:22.343
- No.
I was always a man.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.824
- But your birth certificate
says "female."

38:24.867 --> 38:26.391
Am I right?

38:26.434 --> 38:29.002
- I'm just trying to establish
that Sergeant Preston

38:29.045 --> 38:30.308
has been less than honest.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.005
- My point is,

38:32.048 --> 38:35.835
how can we trust a single word
this witness says

38:35.878 --> 38:38.011
because he's been lying
to the army for years!

38:38.054 --> 38:41.014
- Actually,
it's in my medical forms, sir.

38:41.057 --> 38:44.844
- Yeah, but your friends,
your foxhole buddies,

38:44.887 --> 38:46.541
they don't know the real you,
do they?

38:46.585 --> 38:48.543
- I am the real me.

38:49.370 --> 38:52.678
My gender identity
isn't relevant to what I do.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.593
Just as whatever's
in your pants

38:54.636 --> 38:56.856
isn't relevant to what you do.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.122
- Then tell me this, Sergeant.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.732
How can we be sure
that telling the truth

39:03.776 --> 39:05.386
here today is relevant?

39:05.430 --> 39:07.040
- Objection.

39:09.259 --> 39:10.870
- Withdrawn.

39:11.784 --> 39:13.220
For the record,

39:13.263 --> 39:15.527
in exchange for your testimony
here today,

39:15.570 --> 39:19.879
the state has agreed to drop
all charges against you.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.924
Isn't that right?

39:23.186 --> 39:25.232
- Yes.

39:25.275 --> 39:28.235
- Right.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.846
I'm done.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.729
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:43.772 --> 39:45.426
- We have, Your Honor.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.602
- On the charge of rape
in the first degree,

39:47.646 --> 39:49.865
how do you find?

39:49.909 --> 39:51.737
- We find the defendant,
Tyler Jones,

39:51.780 --> 39:53.521
guilty.

39:53.565 --> 39:56.132
- Members of the jury,
the State of New York

39:56.176 --> 39:58.831
thanks you for your service.

40:49.838 --> 40:52.624
- You didn't have to do this.

40:52.667 --> 40:55.844
- No.
No, an apology is due.

40:55.888 --> 40:59.369
- Well, accepted, but you don't
have to pretend you like me.

41:00.414 --> 41:02.503
- Truth is, I didn't.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.113
- Because of what I do.

41:08.466 --> 41:09.902
- Um...

41:09.945 --> 41:12.426
actually,

41:12.470 --> 41:14.689
I've been, um...

41:14.733 --> 41:16.865
dating this cardiologist,

41:16.909 --> 41:20.869
and I thought things
were going great,

41:20.913 --> 41:23.524
until he left
his credit card statement out,

41:23.568 --> 41:26.527
and it turns out,
while I've been working late,

41:26.571 --> 41:30.966
Dr. Al has been running around
with escorts.

41:31.010 --> 41:34.056
- Working girls who take Amex.

41:35.231 --> 41:37.799
I've...

41:37.843 --> 41:42.369
counseled hundreds of women,
but...

41:42.412 --> 41:45.981
when it happens to you,
you wonder...

41:46.025 --> 41:49.507
what do they have that I don't?

41:51.900 --> 41:53.380
- From my experience,

41:53.423 --> 41:54.903
guys don't come to girls
like me

41:54.947 --> 41:57.558
because their ladies
are lacking something.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.299
They come because they are.

42:02.302 --> 42:05.435
And the sad thing is,
they're never gonna find it.

42:20.581 --> 42:20.973
.

42:23.671 --> 42:30.939
