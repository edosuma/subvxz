[Angelina] <i>Previously on</i> Manifest...

00:21.646 --> 00:23.273
Angelina, you're alive?

00:23.273 --> 00:25.942
We always seem to find a way
to each other. We're connected, Cal.

00:25.942 --> 00:28.194
They're gone! The Callings are gone.

00:28.945 --> 00:29.988
[Michaela] Dad.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.782
- Dad! Dad!
- Your father suffered a massive stroke.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.869
- Autumn Cox? From the plane, right?
- You got anywhere we can go?

00:35.869 --> 00:37.495
[Angelina] I might know somewhere.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.998
[Saanvi] The ALNI patients are down there.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.792
Well, we still don't know
what the major did to them or why.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.962
Dr. Bahl, you need to come with me.
You've been transferred.

00:45.962 --> 00:48.339
- No! Ben! Ben! Ben!
- Hey!

00:48.339 --> 00:51.009
- Be a brave girl now.
- [Michaela chuckles]

00:51.009 --> 00:52.010
[Beverly chuckles]

00:52.010 --> 00:52.927
Thank you.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.513
I've spoken to Washington.
We're cleared for isolation protocol.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.849
You can't leave them here.
These are human beings.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.976
- What about their rights?
- The decision has been made.

01:04.189 --> 01:05.690
You texted. Was there--

01:05.690 --> 01:09.235
Oh, uh, yeah. I don't even...
I don't even remember what that was about.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.326
[mysterious music plays]

01:21.706 --> 01:24.876
[woman] It was bad enough you traipsed
through neighborhoods like this as a cop.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.253
God knows I'm glad
you came to your senses and quit.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.380
I'm more than happy
to float your current endeavor.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.591
- Thank you, Mom, but...
- [rock music playing]

01:31.591 --> 01:34.969
But why buy a decrepit building
in this dumpy neighborhood

01:34.969 --> 01:36.429
when you can afford anywhere?

01:37.222 --> 01:39.224
I showed you
that perfect little place in Tribeca--

01:39.224 --> 01:40.141
Near you.

01:40.141 --> 01:42.977
Exactly! It'll make going to
your doctor appointments so much easier.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.729
Enough, Mom, please.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.650
Well, I like the Sun's Breath
and Summer Faun.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.693
Once I see them on the wall,
I'll know for sure.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.320
I told you, just not yet.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.783
I just want you to see the whole vision
when it's finished.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.620
I'm sorry, but I appreciate
what you're doing for me so, so much.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.961
I just wish
you weren't playing house solo.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.254
I worry about you.

02:09.921 --> 02:12.507
- See you next week. Call me.
- [chuckles]

02:12.507 --> 02:13.675
- Okay.
- I love you.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.135
I love you. Muah.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.303
Bye, Mama.

[Joe] <i>Yo, Mayor Stone.</i>

03:21.534 --> 03:22.744
What have we got today?

03:22.744 --> 03:26.331
Well, I repaired the composter,
so Hector is much happier.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.292
Still can't get the elevator to work.
TJ won't let it go.

03:29.292 --> 03:30.543
He's working on it.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.504
The bathroom leak is finally fixed.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.341
That or they've turned off our water too.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.051
Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.136
All right. Thanks, Joe.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.559
- It's looking good, Sandy.
- [Sandy] Oh, thanks.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.479
[Randall] You wouldn't believe this joke.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.105
- [man] Hey, Ben.
- Hey.

03:51.105 --> 03:54.692
Turns out it was the red one all along.
[chuckles]

03:58.154 --> 04:01.449
Randall, I think Sandy
could use some help in the garden.

04:01.449 --> 04:05.745
Uh, you know, I would,
but, uh, my back is still killing me.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.916
- Listen, Randall, we need--
- Ben? We need a minute.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.503
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.588
Thomas and I
have been reviewing our rations,

04:15.588 --> 04:17.340
and it's not looking good.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.509
Our staples are running low.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.552
Canned goods almost gone.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.097
All right, let's start
by reducing portion sizes.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.392
Prioritize the young, the elderly.
You think that'll last us until--

04:27.392 --> 04:28.935
A month's a long time.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.479
And I mean, we'll do our best
to stretch it, but

04:31.479 --> 04:34.524
what about after the Death Date?

04:35.108 --> 04:38.820
Assuming we're still around,
we'll have to come up with a new plan.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.239
Thank you, both. Appreciate all you do.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.573
We got you, Ben.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.330
Hey, what did you find? Anything?

04:49.330 --> 04:54.043
I followed all Cal's clues to the letter.
Grain silo, train tracks.

04:54.711 --> 04:58.673
I searched every single area you marked.
I even roped in Luis to see if he'd help.

04:58.673 --> 05:02.760
You've been at this nonstop for days.
I need to be out there with you.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.721
No! Absolutely not.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.723
Listen to me.
That psychopath almost killed you.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.227
I'm so sorry. Listen, I just...

05:13.104 --> 05:14.564
I can't lose you again.

05:15.064 --> 05:17.025
[sentimental music plays]

05:20.820 --> 05:21.654
[coughs]

05:24.073 --> 05:25.992
Cal, you look exhausted.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.619
Are you sure you wanna go into this again?

05:28.619 --> 05:31.956
You've been pulling all-nighters for
the last couple months with the Callings.

05:31.956 --> 05:35.460
I'm fine. I can do this. I can do more.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.588
We got a lot of Callings ahead of us,
and Team Save-The-World

05:38.588 --> 05:41.174
automatically fails
if you run yourself into the ground.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.925
She's right, Cal.
You got nothing to prove.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.012
Well, I hear you guys,
but we've only got a month left.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.098
No one else gets Callings.
So if not me, then who?

05:49.098 --> 05:51.100
With your dad not here,
you're my responsibility.

05:51.100 --> 05:55.229
- Cal, I'm getting worried about you.
- Aunt Mick, please. Trust me.

- Okay, guys. Should we--
- Give him a sec to get the Calling.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.157
- He's gasping for air.
- Five seconds.

[thunder rumbles]

[suspenseful music plays]

06:58.751 --> 07:00.253
- We're out of time.
- Get him out now.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.587
Hey, Cal!

07:04.632 --> 07:07.885
- Cal, wake up! Cal!
- [gasping]

07:07.885 --> 07:10.430
- You scared us. You okay?
- [panting] 14 F.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.479
Autumn Cox.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.649
[Cal] I sat in her seat.
It must be her Calling.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.359
- Autumn? Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.695
Are we really about to blow our cover
for Autumn Cox?

07:25.695 --> 07:27.447
I mean, she's complicated,

07:27.447 --> 07:31.409
but no, we have to solve her Calling
no matter how we feel about someone.

07:31.409 --> 07:34.120
- We can't pick and choose.
- We trawled through Callings for months.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.706
Still no idea if it's balancing the scales
in the right direction.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.416
We might have to wait
until the Death Date.

07:38.416 --> 07:41.627
But we have to have faith for us,
for the passengers locked down,

07:41.627 --> 07:44.630
for the rest of the world,
which means we're solving this Calling.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.551
Come on. You heard the lady.
Let's go find Autumn Cox.

[theme music plays]

08:03.232 --> 08:04.233
[chuckles]

08:04.901 --> 08:06.861
Look who's training for the Baby Olympics.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.113
She has definitely got the drive.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.574
- She learned from the best. Right, Eden?
- Right.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.533
[chuckles]

08:12.533 --> 08:13.701
[Ben] How's Chloe doin'?

08:13.701 --> 08:14.911
[Polly] Okay, I think.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.370
But without Saanvi here,

08:16.370 --> 08:18.331
I worry about milestones
she should be hitting.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.291
I miss Saanvi too. Believe me.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.463
But even though I'm no doctor,
I have raised a few kids.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.548
She looks happy and healthy to me.

08:28.299 --> 08:31.677
Well, Olive and Eden have been great
in keeping her entertained.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.806
It's wild to think that the only world
she's ever known is this place.

08:35.806 --> 08:39.685
Be nice to get her outside
on the grass, sun in her face just once.

08:39.685 --> 08:40.978
[cries]

08:41.979 --> 08:42.897
Yeah.

08:43.689 --> 08:45.024
[rumbling]

08:46.108 --> 08:47.026
What is that?

08:47.818 --> 08:49.737
It's another tremor.
They're getting worse.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.949
Well, there's a volcano growing under us.
I'll check the fuse box.

Contractor, remember?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.175
[chuckles]

09:11.175 --> 09:13.719
- Used to see this in old buildings.
- Yeah, good point.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.181
Wonder if the tremors are causing
the lights to flicker. What've we got?

09:17.181 --> 09:18.182
Bad wiring.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.434
[rumbling]

09:22.436 --> 09:24.021
[man] Yeah. No, I felt that.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.356
[indistinct chatter]

09:25.356 --> 09:26.983
- [man 2] You okay?
- [man] More of a jolt.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.068
- You got a flashlight?
- Yeah.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.154
[sighs]

09:39.328 --> 09:41.122
[Randall] Oh, that doesn't look good.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.293
Tremor must have shorted the system.
Whole thing's down.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.462
[sighs] So when do you think
we could get it back up and running?

09:48.462 --> 09:50.423
Uh, there's no fixing this.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.758
Not without a lot of materials
we don't have.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.761
Help! Help! Ben, come quickly!

09:55.761 --> 09:58.014
They're dying. The ALNI patients.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.516
[devices beeping]

10:03.686 --> 10:04.812
[Ben] No, no, no.

10:04.812 --> 10:08.190
No power to the life support system.
They're gonna die.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.775
We have to do something.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.237
They're barely hanging on as it is!
What do you expect us to do?

10:13.237 --> 10:15.573
We're gonna do
whatever it takes to save them.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.699
Suit yourself.

10:16.699 --> 10:21.162
Okay, we need manual ventilation bags.
Henry, check supplies.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.750
I saw a small generator in storage.
It won't power the building,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.711
but it might have enough juice
to keep these machines running.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.087
[flat-line beep]

10:30.087 --> 10:34.050
Okay, go. We can't lose these people!
Henry, I need your help.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.135
[suspenseful music plays]

10:38.304 --> 10:39.430
Go. Go. Go.

10:42.975 --> 10:44.769
Come on. Come on. Stay with me.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.520
Come on.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.692
Hey! Look who's up
and walking around like a champ.

10:51.692 --> 10:52.693
[Steve chuckles]

10:52.693 --> 10:55.154
Attaboy. Come on, Steve. Sit down.

10:56.030 --> 10:56.906
[groans]

10:57.448 --> 10:59.158
[grunts] Thank you.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.201
[sighs]

11:00.201 --> 11:02.453
How's it going in here?
You guys find Autumn yet?

11:02.453 --> 11:05.665
I tried every possible resource.
She's not in the system.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.749
Completely off radar.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.167
Last known location of Autumn

11:08.167 --> 11:10.169
was with the missing passengers
at the safe house.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.046
Then they just vanished from thin air.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.215
Okay, so we find the passengers,
we find her.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.842
Did you find anything on the plane
that might be a clue?

11:16.842 --> 11:20.012
Those creepy vines
were squeezing the life out of me.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.224
There was something. Uh, a white grid?

11:23.224 --> 11:24.850
[thunder rumbles]

11:26.268 --> 11:28.020
But I could see reflections.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.146
Like a window?

11:29.146 --> 11:33.401
Yeah, but...
but with horizontal lines behind it.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.610
[Michaela] Slats?

11:36.028 --> 11:38.280
Like the ones at Beverly's?

11:38.906 --> 11:40.074
Exactly like that.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.827
Guys, that place has been empty.
No one's lived there for months.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.329
No, we haven't lived there for months.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.414
We gotta go home.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.043
- I'm gonna come with.
- Yeah, you're the boss.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.212
[grunts]

11:54.296 --> 11:55.381
Dad!

11:57.508 --> 11:59.969
What happened? Did you need something?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.430
- What happened?
- He fell. I gotta stay here with him.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.931
I'm not leaving you alone.

12:03.931 --> 12:07.768
I'll stick with Mick, Jared.
You and Cal go. It's okay. It's all right.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.562
Go. Every day counts.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.772
We'll stay in touch
and coordinate from there.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.024
I believe in you. We all do.
You got this, okay?

12:14.024 --> 12:15.151
I won't let you down.

Hey. Look out for him, okay?

I hope this works.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.913
For now.

- [sighs] Dad!

12:47.558 --> 12:51.020
We got most of them stabilized,
but we lost Victor and Simone.

12:51.020 --> 12:51.979
That's on me.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.316
- What can I do to help?
- [Ben] I don't know.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.943
We need to focus
on getting the main power back

12:57.943 --> 12:59.779
so we don't lose somebody else.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.114
How long will the generator last?

13:02.114 --> 13:05.743
Based on the fuel gauge,
gen'll give us three hours, tops.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.412
We'll need outside help,
or these guys won't see tomorrow.

13:08.412 --> 13:09.955
What if we made an SOS?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.625
Last time we tried
to make contact with the outside world,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.126
no one responded. No one cared.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.586
[Olive] Then make them care.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.589
I mean, let's make a banner big enough
for the outside people to see.

Let us know if anything changes.

not the old world

14:19.859 --> 14:22.444

That's Autumn. Why would she,
any of them, be with that killer?

Doesn't look like they have a gun to their
head, so they must be here by choice.

We gotta find a way to get inside
so we can isolate Angelina.

We didn't come here for Angelina.
We came here to talk to you.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.029
Look, we need to know
what these purple flower vines mean.

15:47.529 --> 15:48.781
What do they mean to you?

15:49.782 --> 15:52.242
Angelina wouldn't want me helping you.

from your seat on the plane.

You can be in serious danger. Please.
Please tell us what you know.
