02:10.440 --> 02:11.150
Gohan!

02:11.220 --> 02:12.860
Hurry! Hurry!

02:22.150 --> 02:23.450
Father!

02:26.160 --> 02:28.150
Goku is...

02:30.190 --> 02:32.420
K-Kakarrot!

02:35.170 --> 02:37.070
Goku has died.

02:38.250 --> 02:42.730
Everyone seals up the sorrow in their hearts their
own way,

02:42.770 --> 02:45.330
and peace continues for a short time.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.020
And then, half a year later...

02:53.180 --> 02:56.710
A devilish pair appears on an island in the south.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.180
The warriors step forward. However...

03:06.820 --> 03:08.730
Piccolo dies.

03:08.990 --> 03:09.900
So do Vegeta,

03:10.290 --> 03:11.190
Yamucha,

03:11.450 --> 03:12.420
Tenshinhan,

03:12.540 --> 03:13.680
and Kuririn.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.900
The world is plunged into the depths of terror as

03:18.940 --> 03:22.310
a result of these two Artificial Humans.

03:23.790 --> 03:27.870
This is the story of another future.

03:31.320 --> 03:37.750
"Defiance in the face of despair!! The remaining
superwarriors- Gohan and Trunks"

03:39.910 --> 03:42.900
And now, thirteen years later...

03:55.930 --> 04:00.060
The Artificial Humans! The Artificial Humans are
attacking!

04:09.370 --> 04:10.700
Somebody help!

04:19.880 --> 04:24.220
I'll give you all ten seconds. See if you can get
away in that time.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.050
I don't think it's very likely, though.

04:28.390 --> 04:28.880
10...

04:30.390 --> 04:31.330
9...

04:32.400 --> 04:33.380
8...

04:33.900 --> 04:34.390
7...

04:35.400 --> 04:36.370
6...

04:36.900 --> 04:37.730
5...

04:39.400 --> 04:40.060
4...

04:40.900 --> 04:41.560
3...

04:43.410 --> 04:44.400
2...

04:45.410 --> 04:46.380
1...

04:47.410 --> 04:48.380
0!

04:54.470 --> 04:57.460
Devils! They're devils!

04:58.470 --> 05:01.270
The Artificial Humans have appeared in
Peppertown. This is hell!

05:01.310 --> 05:03.540
It's as if hell had arrived on earth.

05:03.580 --> 05:09.070
Now that the military has been destroyed, is there
no one who can stand against them?

05:31.440 --> 05:34.270
They're pretty far away, we'll be okay here.

05:35.440 --> 05:40.400
But we don't know how long it might be before
they head this way, do we?

05:40.450 --> 05:44.750
The Artificial Humans continue to attack
mercilessly and indiscriminately!

05:44.780 --> 05:47.950
It's only a matter of time before Peppertown lies
in ruins!

05:54.960 --> 05:58.800
If the Artificial Humans are not defeated, there
can be no future!

05:59.470 --> 06:01.870
At this point, it's up to me to...

06:01.950 --> 06:04.110
Muten Roshi-sama, you mustn't!

06:05.460 --> 06:09.950
He's right! Piccolo, Vegeta, and even Yamucha
were taken out by them!

06:12.460 --> 06:14.020
If only Goku...

06:14.970 --> 06:17.300
If only Goku had lived...

06:31.630 --> 06:37.130
Please, all I ask you is to spare my life! Take as
many clothes as you want!

06:38.140 --> 06:42.370
Oh? You have such stylish clothes. I'm quite
pleased.

06:46.650 --> 06:47.810
They're letting me live!

06:55.990 --> 06:59.320
What, you did him in?

07:00.160 --> 07:04.600
This is no good, No. 17! Didn't I tell you to at least
leave the clothes?

07:05.650 --> 07:06.810
Oops. I forgot.

07:08.150 --> 07:10.750
The terror in Peppertown continues!

07:10.790 --> 07:15.160
What could this cruel, cold-blooded pair be
thinking?

07:20.660 --> 07:22.130
Run away! Run away!

07:22.170 --> 07:25.000
If you dawdle around, you'll get run over!

07:26.670 --> 07:29.760
Peppertown is experiencing the absolute worst of
all terrors!

07:29.810 --> 07:32.330
The Artificial Humans are running mad!

07:35.180 --> 07:37.650
Those miserable Artificial Humans! They won't get
away with this!

07:37.680 --> 07:39.650
I don't know what it is they're thinking,

07:39.680 --> 07:41.980
killing their creator Doctor Gero,

07:42.020 --> 07:44.180
and all those innocent people, one after another!

07:45.690 --> 07:48.320
They're just a pair of monsters who take pleasure
in killing.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.990
Can't anything be done about them?

07:52.200 --> 07:55.190
Mom, would you go on home without me?

08:00.200 --> 08:03.140
Trunks, what are you thinking of doing?

08:09.700 --> 08:11.660
You're not thinking...

08:19.710 --> 08:21.200
Trunks!

08:31.380 --> 08:34.049
Hey! That was awful!

08:37.220 --> 08:40.720
Hey, now! If you aren't lucky, you're headed for
hell!

08:51.740 --> 08:54.210
No. 17! How long are you going to play around!?

08:54.240 --> 08:56.900
Let's hurry up and wreck this city!

09:11.740 --> 09:13.230
Let's go, No. 17.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.920
I'm too late.

10:00.790 --> 10:05.450
Gohan-san! Why are the Artificial Humans doing
this!?

10:23.360 --> 10:30.330
I can't take this! I can't just let the Artificial
Humans keep having their way!

10:30.370 --> 10:34.330
I want to become stronger! I want to get stronger
and beat them!

10:34.370 --> 10:38.710
Gohan-san, please! Will you train me even harder??

10:40.380 --> 10:42.850
I can't just sit here doing nothing!

10:42.880 --> 10:47.820
I have my Dad's blood -the warrior-race Saiyajin
blood running through me!

10:51.890 --> 10:52.860
Gohan-san!

10:54.730 --> 10:57.700
You remind me a lot of when I was younger.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.030
No matter how hard my mother tried to stop me,

11:00.070 --> 11:02.000
I felt like, I had to train, I had to train...

11:03.390 --> 11:06.380
Trunks, those guys are incredibly strong!

11:08.390 --> 11:10.550
Right! I'll do my best!

11:13.900 --> 11:15.560
Way to go, Trunks!

11:16.400 --> 11:18.370
Trunks!

11:18.400 --> 11:19.890
It's Mom, Gohan-san!

11:22.910 --> 11:24.870
Please don't say anything about this, okay?

11:29.910 --> 11:33.210
Oh, good, Trunks, you made it back okay.

11:33.250 --> 11:36.410
I was worried you may have gone to Peppertown.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.890
Uh, ahem.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.910
Ah, Gohan-kun, you're here too.

11:41.420 --> 11:42.390
Yes.

11:42.430 --> 11:45.050
This is perfect. You're probably hungry, aren't
you?

11:45.090 --> 11:47.590
I brought plenty of groceries home, so you're
eating with us.

11:51.430 --> 11:54.930
And hey, you two, I don't want you playing
anything dangerous!

12:12.510 --> 12:14.670
Thanks to those Artificial Humans,

12:14.710 --> 12:17.410
I've been able to get less and less of what I've
wanted to lately.

12:17.450 --> 12:20.910
I'll just have to cover for what's missing with my
cooking skills.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.080
Well, go ahead and eat.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.380
I humbly accept.

12:26.630 --> 12:27.920
I humbly accept.

12:30.530 --> 12:31.960
Second, please.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.460
Amazing, so alike.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.970
What's that?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.670
Wearing that Gi, and eating the way you were,

12:40.670 --> 12:43.900
you seem just like your father Son-kun. It's
amazing.

12:46.110 --> 12:49.380
I made this Gi because I wanted to be strong, like
Father was.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.680
That's what I thought at the time, but I haven't
had much luck.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.310
Maybe, but sometimes I hear stories about you.

12:55.350 --> 12:59.190
You're facing off against the Artificial Humans all
by yourself.

12:59.230 --> 13:00.520
That's pretty cool.

13:02.330 --> 13:03.300
Well...

13:03.330 --> 13:05.230
But Trunks is starting to look up to those stories.

13:05.260 --> 13:08.720
I don't know what to do with him wanting to
imitate you. Can you make him listen to reason?

13:23.770 --> 13:27.600
An impressive Ki. He's every bit the son of
Vegeta.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.690
Help me!

13:54.400 --> 13:56.800
What's wrong? Is that all you've got?

14:12.050 --> 14:12.980
Here.

14:21.140 --> 14:22.330
Gohan-san,

14:22.940 --> 14:25.570
What kind of person was my dad?

14:27.280 --> 14:31.910
He died soon after I was born, and I never knew
him.

14:33.590 --> 14:36.650
Mom doesn't talk about him much, either.

14:37.490 --> 14:42.260
He was a hard man to please, but he was very
strong, and proud of who he was.

14:42.630 --> 14:46.930
Really. Mom says the same thing.

14:52.070 --> 14:53.940
I'm back!

14:54.810 --> 14:56.970
Welcome home. How did it go?

14:57.940 --> 15:00.380
I heard another city got destroyed.

15:00.410 --> 15:04.040
They say half the world's people have been killed
now.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.050
Everyone's livin' in terror.

15:06.820 --> 15:09.650
Oh yeah, an' I heard some stories about Gohan.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.420
About Gohan!? How's Gohan-chan doin'!?

15:13.510 --> 15:18.110
Sounds as though he's partnerin' up with Trunks
an' fightin' the Artificial Humans.

15:18.150 --> 15:21.610
I reckon he's still tryin' to avenge everyone else's
deaths.

15:22.420 --> 15:27.290
If it weren't for them, he would've been a great
scientist by now.

15:33.160 --> 15:40.660
Gohan, come home! I don't care about no Artificial
Humans. Just come home soon.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.800
Get angry! You must become more angry!

15:51.850 --> 15:53.940
Anger will make you a Super Saiyajin!

16:16.620 --> 16:17.960
Shoot!

16:17.960 --> 16:21.920
It's quite possible he might become an even
greater warrior than I am!

16:21.960 --> 16:24.560
He could even win against the Artificial Humans!

16:26.330 --> 16:30.100
I bet this is the only amusement park still doing
business these days.

16:30.140 --> 16:34.300
Our city still has a military presence, so the
Artificial Humans won't attack us.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.440
Hey there, no cutting in, keep your place in line.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.450
Stay in line? You must be joking.

16:50.490 --> 16:52.790
No you don't, go back to your pla-...

16:53.490 --> 16:55.150
I hate this guy.

17:05.670 --> 17:09.609
Hello? Is this the military? Hello?

17:10.339 --> 17:14.280
Hello? Hello? Hello...?

17:18.329 --> 17:20.270
We should have come here sooner!

17:20.940 --> 17:24.740
This stuff is too good to be used by regular
humans!

17:36.020 --> 17:36.810
Over there, Trunks!

17:36.850 --> 17:37.680
Right!

17:38.820 --> 17:40.980
No. 17, hurry, hurry!

17:48.760 --> 17:50.760
What, you guys again?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.660
And we were in such a good mood, too.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.400
No. 17, take care of them quickly.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.070
All right.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.340
Trunks, stay back!

17:59.640 --> 18:00.730
Right.

18:35.230 --> 18:37.460
He's winning! Gohan-san is winning!

18:53.910 --> 18:56.380
Don't interfere, No. 18!

18:56.420 --> 18:59.820
Don't cry sour grapes. You almost had it there.

18:59.850 --> 19:02.080
Let's take care of these guys so we can play!

19:02.420 --> 19:03.720
Gohan-san!

19:45.160 --> 19:46.430
Lousy brat!

19:59.710 --> 20:01.080
Damn!

20:04.950 --> 20:06.080
Trunks!

20:06.290 --> 20:07.250
You aren't getting away!

21:21.760 --> 21:24.730
Hmph. Well, we can't play here any more.

21:24.760 --> 21:27.820
We still have to finish them off.

21:28.230 --> 21:30.220
Surely they're already dead.

21:30.270 --> 21:33.240
And if they are alive, we'll see them again.

21:33.270 --> 21:34.260
Let's go home.

21:36.010 --> 21:36.980
All right then.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.660
T- this is the last Senzu.

22:43.940 --> 22:48.310
T- Trunks, you...take it.

22:50.280 --> 22:54.010
You're...our last hope.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.670
What happened, Trunks!?

23:33.710 --> 23:36.840
Gohan-san was protecting me, and he...

23:36.880 --> 23:40.080
Hurry and lay him down on the bed! We'll have to
call a doctor!

23:44.220 --> 23:47.680
It's all right. He's no longer in any mortal danger.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.320
Your mom knew all about what you were doing.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.860
About how you and Gohan-kun were fighting
together.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.870
I'm sorry, mom.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.600
If only Son-kun were alive...

24:01.840 --> 24:04.540
Pretty soon, the time machine will be finished.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.670
Once it's done, you'll be able to get inside it,

24:06.710 --> 24:09.240
and it will take you back in time to when Son-kun
was still alive...

24:14.490 --> 24:18.080
Damn you, Artificial Humans!

24:32.420 --> 24:34.220
Get angry! You've got to get angrier!

24:35.820 --> 24:39.160
Damn! While we're here doing this, who knows
what they're up to?

25:15.100 --> 25:16.500
Crap!

25:18.100 --> 25:20.800
Why can't I become a Super Saiyajin?

25:21.470 --> 25:23.340
Just a little farther, Trunks.

25:23.370 --> 25:25.310
It was awfully hard for me, too.

25:28.590 --> 25:31.530
Becoming a Super Saiyajin is a matter of anger.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.000
I thought about how Piccolo-san and Kuririn-san,

25:34.030 --> 25:36.730
and everyone else were killed by the Artificial
Humans.

25:36.770 --> 25:41.570
And as I dwelt on that, it finally happened, and I
became a Super Saiyajin.

25:41.610 --> 25:44.400
You've got Vegeta-san's blood flowing through
you.

25:44.440 --> 25:48.040
You'll be a Super Saiyajin before long. That's for
sure!

25:52.350 --> 25:54.110
The Metroplex!

25:55.950 --> 25:59.890
Damned Artificial Humans! They've finally come to
this city!

26:01.130 --> 26:02.790
This time you've had it!

26:06.700 --> 26:09.190
Gohan-san, are you in any shape for this?

26:09.630 --> 26:12.600
Trunks, you stay here, you hear me?

26:12.640 --> 26:15.610
No way! If you're going, Gohan-san, then I'm going
too!

26:15.640 --> 26:17.610
I'm a lot stronger than before!

26:17.640 --> 26:21.770
Trunks! Don't take the Artificial Humans' power so
lightly!

26:22.380 --> 26:24.440
I won't be a burden any longer!

26:24.480 --> 26:28.010
I want to fight alongside you, Gohan-san!

26:36.910 --> 26:39.780
Okay, you got it. Trunks, let's go!

26:39.810 --> 26:40.470
Right!

26:45.890 --> 26:49.190
Trunks, you're our last hope.

26:49.220 --> 26:54.690
If you were to die, there won't be any warriors left
to defend the earth.

26:54.730 --> 26:58.130
You're the last warrior, and a few years from now,

26:58.170 --> 27:01.760
you'll have the ability to defeat the Artificial
Humans.

27:19.890 --> 27:24.880
Give it up, No. 17. There are hardly any humans
left here.

27:24.930 --> 27:26.660
Let's go somewhere else.

27:26.750 --> 27:30.810
Chances are there's a place to the north of there
where the humans are hiding.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.810
Don't be in such a hurry!

27:32.850 --> 27:35.010
Let's be more though.

27:35.050 --> 27:37.450
If we don't carefully exterminate everyone,

27:37.490 --> 27:40.420
then where's the fun of it all for us?

27:43.700 --> 27:46.890
We could just as well blow it all up at once.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.530
Okay then, let's play some kind of game.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.870
You could run them over with a car or something.

27:56.780 --> 27:58.440
That might be fun too...

28:21.830 --> 28:24.600
No. 17, you look hilarious!

28:26.070 --> 28:30.770
I like these clothes. When they get ragged, it
annoys me.

28:30.860 --> 28:34.350
They're not as sturdy as our bodies, you
understand.

28:34.400 --> 28:37.090
I've only got four more sets like this.

28:38.370 --> 28:42.170
But never mind that, Son Gohan. You really are
still alive.

28:44.510 --> 28:46.570
We won't let you go this time.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.810
We're going to fight you at full power and kill you.

28:52.710 --> 28:56.210
I am not going to die! Not even if this body is
destroyed...

28:58.290 --> 29:02.050
There will be another who will arise and carry out
my last wish...

29:04.360 --> 29:07.890
And he will defeat you Artificial Humans!

32:07.890 --> 32:08.980
Gohan-san!

32:13.970 --> 32:17.530
I can't feel Gohan-san's Ki!

32:41.660 --> 32:43.720
Gohan-san...

32:57.910 --> 32:59.070
Gohan-san...

33:00.140 --> 33:01.340
Gohan-san!

33:01.780 --> 33:04.080
Goha- Gohan-san!

33:17.800 --> 33:19.560
Gohan-san...

33:34.460 --> 33:35.790
This can't be!

33:38.930 --> 33:44.100
Gohan-san! Gohan-san! Gohan-san!

33:44.840 --> 33:48.000
GOHAN-SAN!

34:28.739 --> 34:31.210
And so, three years later...

34:31.949 --> 34:36.040
I'm home, Mom. I managed to buy a lot of good
groceries today.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.409
Welcome back. Guess what, Trunks.

34:38.449 --> 34:40.750
We've got just about enough energy charged

34:40.840 --> 34:42.600
in the time machine for a round-trip journey.

34:43.270 --> 34:46.870
This will be enough to let you go about twenty
years into the past.

34:46.909 --> 34:49.239
It took nearly eight months to charge it this much;

34:49.280 --> 34:50.710
too bad we can't test it.

34:50.750 --> 34:54.310
I think it will get you there and back safely,
though.

34:55.550 --> 34:57.890
If only my lab hadn't been destroyed,

34:57.920 --> 35:01.260
I could have made it a lot better.

35:01.790 --> 35:07.860
Mom, with the strength I have now, I think it's
enough to defeat the Artificial Humans.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.260
I shouldn't need to go to the trouble of traveling
into the past and learning from them.

35:10.300 --> 35:11.960
You're just having wishful thoughts.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.200
Sure, you've become a lot stronger,

35:14.240 --> 35:18.270
but I'm sure you haven't forgotten how Gohan-kun
was killed three years ago.

35:18.310 --> 35:20.280
I don't think there's that much difference

35:20.310 --> 35:23.210
between how strong he was then and how strong
you are now.

35:23.980 --> 35:26.040
I've trained so much since then!

35:26.080 --> 35:28.920
Quite frankly, I know this time I can take them!

35:28.950 --> 35:32.750
We interrupt this program for an update on the
Artificial Humans.

35:32.790 --> 35:35.050
They are currently attacking Bridgetown,

35:35.090 --> 35:39.430
an area 900 meters south of Metro West.

35:39.500 --> 35:42.160
Residents in the area are advised to use caution.

35:43.150 --> 35:44.620
That's really close to here.

35:45.220 --> 35:48.520
N- Now hold on, Trunks. Don't get any crazy...

35:49.920 --> 35:54.290
I'll be back. I'm going to show you I can beat
them!

35:54.760 --> 35:57.160
Whoa, Trunks! Wait!

36:00.300 --> 36:03.900
Gohan-san, and everyone else, I will avenge you
this day!

36:03.940 --> 36:06.100
You just wait and see what's coming, Artificial
Humans!

36:23.020 --> 36:24.650
Let's head on back.

36:24.690 --> 36:26.180
I'm with you.

36:32.570 --> 36:35.630
Artificial Humans! You've had it this time!

36:35.670 --> 36:38.970
You killed Gohan-san, and I will take revenge!

36:39.010 --> 36:41.470
Such a brat. He never learns, does he?

36:41.510 --> 36:43.980
We don't like you guys.

36:55.920 --> 36:58.360
What nerve! Now you've done it!

38:12.880 --> 38:14.150
I did it!

38:21.090 --> 38:24.690
He's certainly become several times stronger than
last time.

38:24.730 --> 38:27.220
But his attacks are all so direct.

38:27.260 --> 38:29.630
I think that will just wear him out.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.540
They're dodging me.

39:00.580 --> 39:03.050
My energy is missing them by a hair's breadth...

39:25.110 --> 39:27.840
It's no use! They're dodging them!

39:34.010 --> 39:35.210
Where are they!?

39:37.450 --> 39:38.920
Where did they go!?

40:30.050 --> 40:32.280
You seem to be breathing pretty hard.

40:42.220 --> 40:48.520
Unfortunately for you, our energy lasts forever,
and is inexhaustible.

40:56.060 --> 40:59.760
Looks like you've completely lost your will to
fight.

40:59.800 --> 41:02.890
Let's put an end to this, No. 17.

41:58.910 --> 42:00.270
Is he dead?

42:02.880 --> 42:07.750
Artificial Humans! Why are you doing this!?

42:08.450 --> 42:12.410
Doctor Gero apparently built us for the purpose of
world domination,

42:12.460 --> 42:14.920
but that doesn't matter to us.

42:14.960 --> 42:19.690
Whenever we see humans, it angers us. We hate
humans.

42:20.600 --> 42:24.360
You can't get away with this! You can't get away
with this!

43:15.000 --> 43:16.470
And now to finish you...

43:18.670 --> 43:19.470
Wait.

43:20.010 --> 43:22.100
It will be me who finishes him off.

43:48.590 --> 43:52.390
Trunks! Trunks! You're okay!

44:02.070 --> 44:03.530
Mom...

44:03.700 --> 44:08.730
Thank goodness. Trunks, you've been out for the
last five days straight.

44:09.310 --> 44:17.050
Forgive me, Mom. You were right, I'm not nearly a
match for the Artificial Humans.

44:17.050 --> 44:19.510
I'm glad you came back to me alive.

44:19.550 --> 44:22.480
You've got a strong streak of luck, just like your
mom.

44:24.250 --> 44:28.690
As soon as I've recovered, I'm ready to take the
time machine.

44:29.360 --> 44:34.730
That sounds good. First you'll go twenty years
into the past and give Son-kun...

44:34.760 --> 44:37.890
I mean, Gohan-kun's father this medicine.

44:39.070 --> 44:41.940
If only he hadn't died from that heart disease,

44:42.020 --> 44:45.390
I doubt the terrible state the world is in would
have come about like this.

44:45.890 --> 44:50.560
This father of Gohan-san's, was he really all that
strong?

44:51.400 --> 44:54.160
He certainly was strong as well,

44:54.200 --> 44:56.960
but no matter what terrible thing happened...

44:57.000 --> 45:00.270
You felt like he would take care of things for
you...

45:01.570 --> 45:05.030
He always had a way of making you feel like that.

45:07.180 --> 45:08.880
I...

45:08.920 --> 45:12.320
I look forward to meeting Dad.

45:14.990 --> 45:17.920
I'm not sure you'll want to expect too much.

45:27.900 --> 45:30.960
Here. This is the cure for the heart disease.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.630
Be sure you give it to right to Son-kun, okay?

45:33.670 --> 45:35.500
Don't get in over your head.

45:40.760 --> 45:43.660
Right! You be careful too, Mom.

45:44.530 --> 45:46.470
So then,

45:46.500 --> 45:48.060
I'm counting on you!

45:53.780 --> 45:55.110
I'll be back.

45:59.420 --> 46:05.180
And so, Trunks boards the time machine, bound
for today's era.

46:05.220 --> 46:10.920
A whole new battle was waiting for him there.
