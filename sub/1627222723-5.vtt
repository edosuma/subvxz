But I grew up
without my biological mother,

21:07.943 --> 21:10.964
and it always made me feel
a little different

21:11.064 --> 21:13.364
and kind of lost.

Then, when we connected,

so many questions for me.

right now, I'd be there for her.

Well, that's you.
That's not Angie.

You know, every family

and we should never presume

21:29.988 --> 21:32.809

will work for someone else.

54:56.982 --> 54:58.882
I was just gonna head upstairs.

54:58.982 --> 55:00.982
Good night.

55:02.343 --> 55:05.223
Um, why don't you come sit
with us?

55:08.104 --> 55:11.045
I'm tired, and I don't want
to get into a whole thing.

55:11.145 --> 55:15.526
I-I just wanted to say that...
I behaved so poorly.

55:15.626 --> 55:18.487
I mean, I just acted so much

55:18.587 --> 55:22.067
out of my own fears that
I wasn't even able to hear you.

55:23.588 --> 55:25.708
And I feel really ashamed.

55:28.269 --> 55:30.309
I'm so sorry.

55:31.350 --> 55:34.510
And we... we love you.

55:36.831 --> 55:41.672
And-and we're open
to you reaching out to Marcus.

55:42.952 --> 55:45.333
You can meet him if you want to.

55:45.433 --> 55:47.213
We know how important
this is to you.

55:47.313 --> 55:48.974
Oh, my God.

55:49.074 --> 55:50.574
I forgive you.

55:50.674 --> 55:52.095
-I forgive you, and...
-[laughter]

55:52.195 --> 55:54.095
-thank you so much.

55:54.195 --> 55:55.455
[laughing]
Oh, my God.

55:55.555 --> 55:57.176
I love you, sweetheart.

55:57.276 --> 55:58.616
Thank you.

55:58.716 --> 56:00.256
-I love you.
-Thanks.
