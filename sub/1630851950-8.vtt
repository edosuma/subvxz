00:10.172 --> 00:11.413
- Sharon...

00:11.413 --> 00:12.482
Shit.

00:13.620 --> 00:14.931
I'm sorry.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.586
He just wants to talk to you.

00:16.586 --> 00:19.275
- Hi Mrs. Winthrop,
I trust your guest got in okay.

00:19.275 --> 00:20.413
Guest.

00:20.413 --> 00:22.068
- You know I'm not gonna
kill that bitch.

00:22.068 --> 00:23.620
Do I?

00:23.620 --> 00:24.862
Hey, you like porn?

00:24.862 --> 00:26.551
- Sir, I wouldn't
advise that.

00:27.896 --> 00:29.896
- You hit him?
- Yes ma'am.

00:29.896 --> 00:32.137
- Do it again.

00:32.137 --> 00:36.448
- I am going to make a man
out of you yet.

00:39.068 --> 00:40.931
Sure you don't want a drink?

00:40.931 --> 00:43.310
- I already told you
what I want.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.689
- To go home?
- Yes.

00:47.724 --> 00:49.344
- What are you gonna do
when you get there?

00:49.344 --> 00:51.689
That's none of your business.

00:51.689 --> 00:55.379
- You know, if you're just like
a little nice to me,

00:55.379 --> 00:58.413
it might be
really advantageous to you.

00:58.413 --> 01:01.000
- I don't have to be
nice to you.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.724
No, you don't.

01:03.724 --> 01:05.965
Can I leave?

01:05.965 --> 01:08.103
Yes, of course. Soon.

01:08.103 --> 01:11.724
But, you probably want to
hear what I have to say.

01:11.724 --> 01:13.517
What is it?

01:13.517 --> 01:15.862
Have a seat.

01:21.517 --> 01:23.172
I like you.

01:23.172 --> 01:25.206
You don't know me.

01:25.206 --> 01:29.310
- I know that you're
impossibly beautiful.

01:29.310 --> 01:34.000
- Well, thank you,
but this is creepy and wrong.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.137
Eh, depends on who you ask.

01:37.137 --> 01:38.655
- Just because
you're the president

01:38.655 --> 01:41.034
doesn't mean that
you can do this to me.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.034
Actually, it kinda does.

01:44.034 --> 01:45.689
Sir...

01:45.689 --> 01:47.586
Hunter.

01:47.586 --> 01:49.448
- Look, I just,
I just want to leave, alright?

01:49.448 --> 01:52.551
This is wrong
on so many levels.

01:52.551 --> 01:54.827
- Absolutely.
You can go.

01:54.827 --> 01:58.241
But, do you want to hear
what I have to say first?

02:09.586 --> 02:11.517
Open it.

02:20.793 --> 02:25.551
Those are keys to
a new apartment and a new car.

02:27.206 --> 02:30.034
Both of which are in your name.

02:30.034 --> 02:35.758
There's also an investment
account number in there

02:35.758 --> 02:39.965
that has also been opened
in your name.

02:39.965 --> 02:43.620
And as of right now, there is
$100,000 in that account.

02:46.655 --> 02:51.448
Every month,
I will give you a stock tip

02:51.448 --> 02:53.689
and you will buy that stock,

02:53.689 --> 02:59.586
and you will make anywhere from
500,000, 800,000.

03:00.068 --> 03:04.586
Maybe if I juice it just right,

03:04.586 --> 03:06.448
it'll be a million dollars.

03:08.068 --> 03:10.965
In return,

03:10.965 --> 03:15.862
I see you when I want,
we hang out when I want.

03:15.862 --> 03:20.310
We drink, get high,
maybe do some drugs,

03:20.310 --> 03:22.862
just the fun stuff.

03:22.862 --> 03:27.206
Maybe get naked, who knows?
We have a good time.

03:27.206 --> 03:29.172
It'll be a lot of fun.

03:29.172 --> 03:34.620
The only people that will know
will be you, me, and Kyle.

03:34.620 --> 03:38.379
That's it.
Super discreet.

03:38.379 --> 03:39.931
And in the end,

03:42.137 --> 03:44.000
you'll be set for life.

03:47.517 --> 03:50.413
You think I'm a whore?

03:50.413 --> 03:53.000
I know you're not a whore.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.793
I know everything about you.

03:54.793 --> 03:58.758
If you were a whore,
that's 500 bucks.

04:01.517 --> 04:03.310
This isn't happening.

04:03.310 --> 04:06.275
- Well, actually,
it kinda is.

04:06.275 --> 04:08.724
Sir.

04:08.724 --> 04:11.896
Hunter.

04:11.896 --> 04:15.241
- I'm not some whore that's on
the streets for sale.

04:15.241 --> 04:17.137
I value my life and my body.

04:17.137 --> 04:21.448
You cannot come and kidnap me
and bring me to your White House

04:21.448 --> 04:25.931
to be your Sally Hemings.
I'm not that girl.

04:25.931 --> 04:27.413
Be my who?

04:27.413 --> 04:29.793
- You know what I'm
talking about.

04:33.896 --> 04:35.551
- - you!

04:35.551 --> 04:37.827
- - your money and your power,
I am not that girl,

04:37.827 --> 04:40.862
now take me home. Now.

04:43.655 --> 04:46.586
- Ladies and gentlemen,
the President and First Lady.

05:09.413 --> 05:10.655
- If you think this is
helping your cause,

05:10.655 --> 05:12.137
it's the opposite.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.793
When you're mean to me,
it really turns me on.

05:13.793 --> 05:16.000
- Are you, are you
hearing me right now?

05:16.000 --> 05:20.206
- You are so beautiful.
It's painful.

05:20.206 --> 05:22.620
I am not playing with you.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.344
- You're really gonna
pass this up?

05:25.344 --> 05:27.137
Did you hear me?

05:27.137 --> 05:30.344
- You don't want to just
take a little bit of time

05:30.344 --> 05:32.275
to think about it?

05:32.275 --> 05:34.551
- There's nothing
to think about.

05:34.551 --> 05:38.862
Ooh, um...

05:38.862 --> 05:42.000
have you seen
your student loans?

05:42.000 --> 05:45.344
- How about your credit score?
- Alright, okay, okay,

05:45.344 --> 05:47.413
I see there's no
talking to you now.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.896
We are talking.

05:50.862 --> 05:53.068
- You're the president of the
United States of America,

05:53.068 --> 05:56.172
do you not think I will go
to the press with this?

05:56.172 --> 05:58.862
- You won't.
- I will.

05:58.862 --> 06:02.517
- No, you won't, because I'll
just say you're lying

06:02.517 --> 06:05.413
and you have no proof and
you'll look foolish,

06:05.413 --> 06:07.137
you don't want to do that.

06:07.137 --> 06:10.586
- What about all the phone calls
that you made to me?

06:12.620 --> 06:15.793
- You really think those
numbers are traceable?

06:17.724 --> 06:20.103
- Look, I don't want to do this,
okay?

06:20.103 --> 06:24.896
Just, please, just let me
go home, please.

06:24.896 --> 06:30.793
- Look come on, I'm not like
some 75-year-old orange dude,

06:30.793 --> 06:34.482
I'm the hot POTUS!
It'll be fun!

06:34.482 --> 06:36.586
You're disgusting.

06:36.586 --> 06:38.862
- You know, I warned you when
you're mean to me,

06:38.862 --> 06:41.310
it actually kind of turns me on.

06:41.310 --> 06:42.827
- And that little -- charade

06:42.827 --> 06:44.275
that you tried to pull with him,

06:44.275 --> 06:46.379
pretending like you didn't tell
him to come here

06:46.379 --> 06:49.379
and force me here
is bullshit.

06:49.379 --> 06:52.344
- I'm not forcing you
to do anything.

06:52.344 --> 06:55.551
I'm gonna make
your life amazing.

06:55.551 --> 06:58.413
Okay, are you done?

06:58.413 --> 06:59.931
- I don't know,
are we starting?

06:59.931 --> 07:02.000
I'm leaving.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.103
- Okay, okay, okay,
just hold on one second, just...

07:09.793 --> 07:11.517
Don't mention
this to the butler,

07:11.517 --> 07:13.413
and don't mention
this to Sam, alright?

07:13.413 --> 07:15.896
It'll go really horribly
for you,

07:15.896 --> 07:18.413
they'll arrest you for stalking

07:18.413 --> 07:19.965
and being on
White House grounds,

07:19.965 --> 07:21.896
and it just all goes sideways,

07:21.896 --> 07:25.137
so do yourself the favor and
just keep this between us.

07:25.137 --> 07:27.551
Hm.

07:27.551 --> 07:30.172
- - you.

07:33.965 --> 07:37.068
- Kyle? Get in here.

07:38.379 --> 07:40.413
Sir?

07:40.413 --> 07:45.931
- Hey Kyle, can you make sure
she gets off the grounds?

07:45.931 --> 07:47.137
Yes, sir.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.034
- And make sure
she gets home safely?

07:49.034 --> 07:50.413
Yes, sir.

07:50.413 --> 07:53.068
- Now watch yourself,
she is feisty.

07:53.068 --> 07:56.034
Yes, sir.

08:01.862 --> 08:03.724
- You need to let me
take you home.

08:03.724 --> 08:05.034
You people are crazy!

08:05.034 --> 08:06.827
- Just let me
take you home, Sharon.

08:06.827 --> 08:08.344
I don't trust you.

08:08.344 --> 08:10.862
- Okay, well then let me
escort you off the property

08:10.862 --> 08:14.413
and then you can call
whoever you want.

08:14.413 --> 08:15.896
I want to walk to the gate.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.275
- Okay.
Right this way.

08:19.275 --> 08:21.931
You lead the way.

08:28.482 --> 08:31.793
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

08:31.793 --> 08:34.517
Are you going somewhere?

08:34.517 --> 08:36.241
Can I get some air?

08:36.241 --> 08:39.931
- Oh, yes ma'am.
- Okay.

08:43.827 --> 08:49.758
- Do you have to follow me?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:49.758 --> 08:53.000
- I see.
Not so close.

08:55.793 --> 08:58.172
Yes, ma'am.

09:02.344 --> 09:05.448
- Come on, man, just do what
she's telling you to do.

09:05.448 --> 09:07.896
Okay! Okay!

09:10.034 --> 09:11.827
Okay.

09:13.172 --> 09:14.482
Ma'am?

09:14.482 --> 09:16.034
- What?
- Where you going?

09:16.034 --> 09:17.758
- I'm going to the
employee parking lot.

09:17.758 --> 09:21.620
- Ma'am...
- I'm going to see Allan.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.586
I want to talk to him,
is that okay?

09:23.586 --> 09:26.827
- Ma'am...
- Sam, shit.

09:34.655 --> 09:37.103
- Thank you, Grip.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:37.103 --> 09:40.413
- Ma'am?
- I'm just sitting in the car.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.137
Yes, ma'am.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.448
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

10:01.448 --> 10:03.172
What are you doing out here?

10:03.172 --> 10:05.413
- She asked me
to talk to him, sir.

10:07.965 --> 10:10.379
Wait for me in the break room.

10:10.379 --> 10:12.275
Yes, sir.

10:15.344 --> 10:18.206
How are you?

10:18.206 --> 10:21.275
Ma'am, please.

10:21.275 --> 10:25.068
- Just go and take a bullet
to that bitch's head,

10:25.068 --> 10:27.310
and all of the pain will stop.

10:27.310 --> 10:29.000
- Ma'am, Please--

10:29.000 --> 10:32.448
Just do what I tell you to do,

10:32.448 --> 10:35.931
okay? Okay.

10:48.586 --> 10:51.000
Everything okay?

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
- Yes. I think I'm going to go
and take a hot bath.

10:57.310 --> 10:58.862
Yes, ma'am.

10:58.862 --> 11:01.448
You want to watch?

11:01.448 --> 11:03.413
No, ma'am.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.931
You lie. You do.

11:07.931 --> 11:10.206
No ma'am, I don't.

11:10.206 --> 11:15.103
- Okay, well, that's where
I'll be, in the bathtub,

11:15.103 --> 11:20.896
naked, touching myself,
thinking of you.

11:37.724 --> 11:39.379
- Thanks
for coming over.

11:39.379 --> 11:41.241
Sure.

11:41.241 --> 11:42.620
Here.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.068
What's this?

11:46.034 --> 11:48.586
- Richard gave me the money
for the funeral.

11:48.586 --> 11:50.275
Oh.

11:51.655 --> 11:54.517
- Well, that's good.
- Yes.

11:54.517 --> 11:57.413
- Yeah, I talked to him,
he told me you two made up.

11:57.413 --> 11:59.758
Oh, we're making up.

11:59.758 --> 12:02.724
- Okay.
Y'all belong together.

12:02.724 --> 12:04.034
Yes, we do.

12:04.034 --> 12:07.344
Good for you.

12:07.344 --> 12:08.896
So, is...

12:08.896 --> 12:11.275
are things any better
between you and Sam?

12:12.758 --> 12:15.206
No, that's over.

12:15.206 --> 12:17.000
Oh, I'm sorry, Priscilla.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.931
Yeah, I am too.

12:18.931 --> 12:20.655
Are you sure it's over?

12:20.655 --> 12:22.931
- As sure as I'm
black and female.

12:22.931 --> 12:26.172
- But you love each other
so much.

12:26.172 --> 12:28.586
You don't know the half of it.

12:28.586 --> 12:31.068
- Well, is there anything you
can do to just make it work?

12:31.068 --> 12:32.724
Nancy, please don't start.

12:32.724 --> 12:35.620
Priscilla, that man loves you.

12:38.413 --> 12:43.172
- I've got one rule:
do not cheat on me.

12:44.758 --> 12:47.965
It's my only rule.

12:47.965 --> 12:51.172
He did that,
so I have nothing else to say.

12:51.172 --> 12:54.103
- Okay, well just, just
don't give up on him--

12:54.103 --> 12:56.827
- Nancy, it's over!
It is.

12:56.827 --> 13:00.137
Okay, okay.

13:00.137 --> 13:02.586
I get out of here.

13:04.448 --> 13:05.724
Priscilla?

13:07.517 --> 13:10.344
I'm worried about you.

13:13.689 --> 13:17.620
- Well good, because
I'm worried about me, too.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.689
- What can I do
to help you?

13:23.689 --> 13:26.068
- I don't know,
I'm just so outside of myself

13:26.068 --> 13:29.724
with this one, Nancy,
I don't know, just,

13:29.724 --> 13:33.517
just keep praying for me.

13:33.517 --> 13:36.034
- Honey, you know I'm
gonna do that.

13:36.034 --> 13:40.068
- Okay. It's gonna be
what it's gonna be.

13:40.068 --> 13:43.000
Priscilla...

13:43.000 --> 13:46.275
- I'm, I'm gonna go.
I love you, okay?

13:46.275 --> 13:48.551
- Okay.
I love you, too.

13:48.551 --> 13:50.344
Thank you.

13:52.931 --> 13:55.000
Alright.
I'm gonna go.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.620
- Okay.
Priscilla? Call me, okay?

13:59.620 --> 14:01.931
Okay.

14:01.931 --> 14:06.344
- Hey Ms. Cilla.
- Hey, Barry.

14:06.344 --> 14:08.758
- She ain't look
too alright, she okay?

14:08.758 --> 14:11.310
- She's just dealing
with a lot.

14:11.310 --> 14:14.206
- What's going on with her?
- None of your business.

14:14.206 --> 14:15.896
Did you take that girl home?

14:15.896 --> 14:17.758
I took her to the bus stop.

14:17.758 --> 14:20.172
- Barry...
- Yes?

14:20.172 --> 14:21.655
Who was that girl?

14:21.655 --> 14:24.862
- Ma, it was just some
random girl that I met.

14:24.862 --> 14:28.413
- Something is really
wrong with you.

14:28.413 --> 14:29.689
Yeah, okay.

14:29.689 --> 14:31.655
- You just wait 'til
your daddy gets home.

14:31.655 --> 14:35.586
- He's here.
What did I just walk into?

14:35.586 --> 14:37.413
Your son.

14:37.413 --> 14:39.586
Was that Priscilla just left?

14:39.586 --> 14:41.172
Yeah, it was.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.724
What did she want?

14:42.724 --> 14:44.758
- Well, I asked her to
come over to get the money.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.586
Oh, okay, good.

14:47.758 --> 14:50.310
Your son needs to talk to you.

14:50.310 --> 14:53.689
- No, I don't.
- I believe you do.

14:53.689 --> 14:55.241
What's going on?

14:55.241 --> 15:00.103
- Barry?
- What?

15:00.103 --> 15:05.137
- He had some strange-looking
woman in this house.

15:05.137 --> 15:08.586
- What?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

15:08.586 --> 15:10.586
Talk to him.

15:26.310 --> 15:29.482
- You want to tell me
what this is about?

15:29.482 --> 15:31.068
Not really.

15:31.068 --> 15:32.448
Who was she?

15:32.448 --> 15:35.413
- Dad, it was just some girl
that I met.

15:35.413 --> 15:37.310
- Son,
what is going on with you?

15:37.310 --> 15:39.862
- I don't understand why
this is such a big deal.

15:39.862 --> 15:41.206
I'm a man.

15:41.206 --> 15:44.206
- But you still living
in our house.

15:44.206 --> 15:46.172
And you know how your momma
feels about that.

15:46.172 --> 15:48.344
- Well, she let Ruth and Sharon
live here, too.

15:48.344 --> 15:50.068
- That's because you were in a
relationship, not--

15:50.068 --> 15:52.689
Not what? Hooking up?

15:56.137 --> 15:57.931
Don't let it happen again.

15:57.931 --> 15:59.275
- Yes, sir.
- I'm serious.

15:59.275 --> 16:02.206
Okay, Dad, I got you.

16:05.068 --> 16:07.103
Where did you meet this girl?

16:07.103 --> 16:09.034
Online.

16:10.551 --> 16:13.586
On one of those hook-up apps?

16:15.275 --> 16:17.034
What you know about that, man?

16:17.034 --> 16:19.310
- Okay son, look, I'm older
than you, but I'm not dead.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.551
Apparently.

16:26.551 --> 16:31.241
- Alright son, listen,
you be careful with her.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.413
- And don't let it happen again.
- I got you.

16:41.275 --> 16:44.931
Sharon! Sharon!

16:51.586 --> 16:53.310
Sharon!

16:58.034 --> 17:00.310
911, what's your emergency?

17:00.310 --> 17:02.758
- Uh yes, I'm calling from
Richardson Pharmacy.

17:02.758 --> 17:04.206
Yes, what is it?

17:04.206 --> 17:05.793
- One of my employees
is missing,

17:05.793 --> 17:07.275
there's shell casings
on the floor,

17:07.275 --> 17:09.551
I think something happened.

17:09.551 --> 17:12.620
Please hold for Sharon.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.620
What's going on?

17:15.620 --> 17:17.206
- You better tell him that
you're okay

17:17.206 --> 17:20.965
and that you'll explain
when you get there.

17:20.965 --> 17:22.655
Who is that?

17:22.655 --> 17:26.344
- If you want him to be safe,
tell him that you're okay.

17:33.172 --> 17:34.793
Hello.

17:34.793 --> 17:37.241
- Sharon?
- Yeah.

17:37.241 --> 17:40.172
- What the hell,
are you okay?

17:40.172 --> 17:41.620
Yes.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.689
- How did 911 know that I was
trying to--

17:43.689 --> 17:45.379
- Look, listen,
it's...

17:45.379 --> 17:47.172
it's a long story,
I'll explain later.

17:47.172 --> 17:48.724
- What's going on?
Where are you?

17:48.724 --> 17:50.310
I'm fine.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.586
I'll be back at the pharmacy
in less than 20 minutes.

17:52.586 --> 17:54.034
- No, Sharon,
tell me what happened!

17:54.034 --> 17:55.862
Where are you?

17:55.862 --> 17:57.103
Everything is fine.

17:57.103 --> 17:58.448
- Sharon, tell me,
where are you?

17:58.448 --> 18:01.827
- Everything is fine, bye.
- Sharon?

18:05.896 --> 18:08.344
Thank you.

18:10.068 --> 18:11.551
Can I go?

18:11.551 --> 18:13.310
- Yep, this road will lead you
to the main gate,

18:13.310 --> 18:16.206
and they'll let you out there.

18:16.206 --> 18:20.862
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

18:20.862 --> 18:22.689
Alright.

18:22.689 --> 18:25.103
And your phone.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.103
- What?
- Here.

18:27.103 --> 18:28.896
You had it this whole time?

18:28.896 --> 18:30.793
- It won't work until you
get off the property,

18:30.793 --> 18:33.206
and even still,
I will be monitoring it,

18:33.206 --> 18:35.448
that or any
other number you get.

18:40.034 --> 18:41.689
Alright, so I'm gonna go now.

18:41.689 --> 18:43.655
Go on.

18:59.448 --> 19:03.344
- Agent Gripley?
- Yes, sir

19:03.344 --> 19:05.965
- What was that about?
- Sir?

19:05.965 --> 19:08.965
- You chit-chatting with the
chief of staff's assistant?

19:08.965 --> 19:10.724
Nothing, sir.

19:10.724 --> 19:13.551
- It looked as if
you punched him.

19:13.551 --> 19:16.620
- No, sir.
- Don't -- lie to me.

19:16.620 --> 19:20.620
- I don't know what
you mean, sir. I didn't.

19:22.379 --> 19:24.931
What happened?

19:24.931 --> 19:28.551
- She asked me to see him,
he wanted to leave,

19:28.551 --> 19:31.586
and uh, I restrained him.

19:31.586 --> 19:33.551
- Why did she ask you
to see him?

19:33.551 --> 19:36.413
I'm not sure, sir.

19:36.413 --> 19:38.172
Are you bullshitting me?

19:38.172 --> 19:41.586
No, sir. Not at all.

19:41.586 --> 19:43.482
- You know,
if I find out you are--

19:43.482 --> 19:45.862
I'm not, sir.

19:45.862 --> 19:47.482
Get out of here.

19:47.482 --> 19:49.827
Yes, sir.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.896
Here we go...

19:59.344 --> 20:02.103
What the hell?

20:02.103 --> 20:04.137
You've got to be shitting me.

20:06.344 --> 20:08.379
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle,
get to my office right now,

20:08.379 --> 20:10.586
right now,
right away.

20:14.896 --> 20:16.137
- Look.
- Sir?

20:16.137 --> 20:19.413
Come here, look, look. Look!

20:19.413 --> 20:21.448
- What is it
that I'm looking at?

20:23.241 --> 20:25.689
- No way.
- Today Kyle, today!

20:25.689 --> 20:27.241
- How the hell
did he get in here?

20:27.241 --> 20:30.517
- She asked Allan to give him a
pass, he had a fake ID,

20:30.517 --> 20:32.000
it's all right here.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.758
Who is she?

20:33.758 --> 20:35.931
Lilly.

20:35.931 --> 20:37.655
- What?
- Yeah.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.344
- And why didn't the facial
recognition pick him up

20:42.344 --> 20:44.000
- and alert us?
- I don't know, Kyle,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.103
Do I look like I would know
something like that?

20:48.827 --> 20:53.931
- Great. Okay.
Well, where did he go?

20:53.931 --> 20:55.862
- How am I gonna know that,
Kyle? Huh?

20:55.862 --> 20:59.068
I just, I just literally
showed you.

20:59.068 --> 21:00.827
Okay.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.931
- Look, you find him Kyle,
you find him, you find him,

21:02.931 --> 21:05.448
and you bring that ass to me,
you hear me?

21:08.379 --> 21:13.000
- Yeah, I'm gonna find him,
but you have a problem at home.

21:15.206 --> 21:19.551
- Are we really, really
doing this right now?

21:19.551 --> 21:23.034
- Yeah.
Yeah, we sure are.

21:23.034 --> 21:24.931
You know what?

21:24.931 --> 21:29.482
I'll take care of my problem at
home, okay?

21:29.482 --> 21:31.724
Okay.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.517
- Why are you taking
all this -- time?

21:33.517 --> 21:35.482
Get the hell out of here!

21:37.241 --> 21:41.586
- Finally.
Get your hands off me.

21:41.586 --> 21:43.827
Get your ass and go.

22:00.034 --> 22:02.103
Hey.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.862
What the hell happened?

22:04.862 --> 22:07.379
I'm fine.

22:07.379 --> 22:10.551
Sharon, where were you?

22:10.551 --> 22:13.551
- I can't tell you.
- What?

22:13.551 --> 22:16.517
I can't tell you.

22:16.517 --> 22:19.310
Did you see my store?

22:19.310 --> 22:20.965
- Yeah, I--
- You see that?

22:20.965 --> 22:22.517
- I'm sorry,
I'll clean it up.

22:22.517 --> 22:25.344
- No, this isn't about
cleaning it up.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.137
I just want to know
what happened.

22:27.137 --> 22:32.000
- Kareem, I'm fine, alright?
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.172
- There's shell casings
on the floor.

22:35.172 --> 22:37.827
- Somebody came in
and they tried to rob me,

22:37.827 --> 22:40.689
- and I shot him.
- What?

22:40.689 --> 22:44.689
- Yeah, I shot him
and I missed.

22:44.689 --> 22:46.448
Did you call the police?

22:46.448 --> 22:50.862
- Yes, and I was with them,
I told them.

22:50.862 --> 22:52.862
- Well Sharon, there's no
footage on the tapes.

22:52.862 --> 22:54.620
- Kareem, look, I don't
know what to tell you.

22:54.620 --> 22:58.551
- There's entire periods
of time missing.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.275
- Can you please
just let this go?

23:00.275 --> 23:02.206
- How can I let this go?
- Please?

23:02.206 --> 23:04.137
No, you were gone!

23:04.137 --> 23:06.586
I'm scared for your life, you
look like you've seen a ghost,

23:06.586 --> 23:08.344
tell me what happened!

23:10.344 --> 23:13.310
- Can you just drop this,
please?

23:13.310 --> 23:17.793
Did somebody threaten you? Hm?

23:17.793 --> 23:21.551
- I need to go home.
- Hey, hey, hey hey, hey,

23:21.551 --> 23:25.068
hey, come here, come here,
okay.

23:25.068 --> 23:28.862
- Okay, you can stay with me.
- No.

23:28.862 --> 23:30.172
Why?

23:32.344 --> 23:34.965
- No, that's, that's, that's--
- Look Dale's at my place.

23:34.965 --> 23:38.137
Right? Least you can do,
just stay with him.

23:38.137 --> 23:41.344
- No, I just, I just,
I need to--

23:41.344 --> 23:43.517
What?

23:43.517 --> 23:47.517
- I need to think, alright?
I need to...

23:47.517 --> 23:48.931
Just let me think.

23:48.931 --> 23:50.931
- Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

23:50.931 --> 23:53.793
Um, I need to go to Barry's.

23:53.793 --> 23:55.724
I need to go to Barry's.

23:58.482 --> 24:00.103
Why?

24:00.103 --> 24:04.862
- I just need to go.
- Okay, okay, alright, alright.

24:04.862 --> 24:07.551
- I'll take you over there.
- No, no, um,

24:07.551 --> 24:09.379
I have my sister's car
and I'll go.

24:09.379 --> 24:10.448
Then I'll follow.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.586
- No!
Just...

24:12.586 --> 24:14.379
Alright, um,
where are my keys?

24:18.482 --> 24:20.793
- Sharon,
you're shutting me out,

24:20.793 --> 24:23.172
and I know something's wrong.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.206
It's for your own good.

24:27.206 --> 24:29.275
- I gotta go.
- What are you saying?

24:29.275 --> 24:32.068
- I gotta go.
- What are you saying, honey?

24:42.172 --> 24:46.103
- Why are we just
sitting here?

24:46.103 --> 24:49.275
They want to see all we know.

24:49.275 --> 24:53.310
- Well, it's a good thing
we don't know anything!

24:53.310 --> 24:58.620
- You do know that makes us
sound dumb as shit, right?

24:58.620 --> 25:02.379
About all this?

25:02.379 --> 25:04.206
I get it.

25:04.206 --> 25:06.241
But you should really be
thinking about what it is

25:06.241 --> 25:08.551
you're about to say
when they come in here.

25:08.551 --> 25:12.448
Okay. Okay.

25:12.448 --> 25:13.896
You know what?

25:13.896 --> 25:18.620
I can say that
I don't trust you.

25:18.620 --> 25:20.241
That's fine.

25:20.241 --> 25:23.206
- You know why?
'Cause you don't trust me.

25:23.206 --> 25:26.862
- Oh, a hell of a lot more
than you trust me.

25:26.862 --> 25:29.758
- That's not exactly
a ringing endorsement.

25:31.758 --> 25:33.206
It is what it is.

25:33.206 --> 25:35.068
- You're gonna move
away from me?

25:48.793 --> 25:51.862
Do you think this is
how it ends?

25:51.862 --> 25:54.793
- Probably.
- Yeah.

25:57.379 --> 25:58.965
It's not.

26:00.655 --> 26:02.344
Hello.

26:02.344 --> 26:05.206
- Mister Vice President?
- Yes, thank you for meeting me.

26:05.206 --> 26:07.103
- Well, it's not like we had a
choice, is it?

26:07.103 --> 26:08.310
Right.

26:08.310 --> 26:11.275
- Well, I'll cut to the chase.
- Please.

26:11.275 --> 26:13.000
- I know a lot
about you both.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.758
Diane Wilmont came to see me
before her death.

26:14.758 --> 26:16.793
Her murder.

26:16.793 --> 26:20.275
- Yes, her murder.
- You know about that?

26:20.275 --> 26:21.931
- I know about almost
all of it.

26:21.931 --> 26:23.758
I hear you have
the rest of what I don't.

26:23.758 --> 26:27.931
- Yeah.
But we're not talking.

26:27.931 --> 26:29.965
- Okay look, I know you
guys don't trust me--

26:29.965 --> 26:33.965
- No, we don't. I mean, we are
in the White House.

26:33.965 --> 26:37.379
- Okay. I'll go first.
Leave us.

26:44.344 --> 26:45.793
Here's what we know,

26:45.793 --> 26:47.586
the President killed a girl
in his bed.

26:47.586 --> 26:49.206
You have the mattress.

26:49.206 --> 26:51.551
They tried to cover it up by
killing an agent

26:51.551 --> 26:53.068
and blaming you for it.

26:53.068 --> 26:57.379
Now, the President and First
Lady are beyond corrupt.

26:57.379 --> 27:00.034
Her father's corrupt because he
put him here,

27:00.034 --> 27:01.724
and the President hasn't
made it through

27:01.724 --> 27:06.310
a single cabinet meeting without
being bored out of his mind.

27:06.310 --> 27:09.655
He's a danger to the country,
and we have to do something.

27:09.655 --> 27:13.172
Now, I can have him removed
using the 25th Amendment,

27:13.172 --> 27:15.172
but I need to be sure that
I have all the evidence

27:15.172 --> 27:18.034
before I take it to Congress,
where the party loves him

27:18.034 --> 27:21.068
because he's as dumb
as a box of rocks

27:21.068 --> 27:23.034
and they're getting most of
their agenda through,

27:23.034 --> 27:27.000
so this will be
an uphill battle.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.517
So what do you want from us?

27:29.517 --> 27:31.413
Testify before Congress.

27:31.413 --> 27:33.482
- Wow.

27:33.482 --> 27:36.482
- What good's that gonna do when
he has the House and the Senate?

27:36.482 --> 27:39.000
- I promise you,
once they hear your story,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.551
a vet, what they did to you,
left you for dead.

27:41.551 --> 27:43.586
Diane Wilmont story,
and the story of the maid--

27:43.586 --> 27:45.310
Maid?

27:45.310 --> 27:47.103
- Yes. We're told
that there is a maid

27:47.103 --> 27:49.206
that may have also been killed
in the White House.

27:49.206 --> 27:52.034
We believe he was sleeping
with her as well.

27:52.034 --> 27:55.586
Hey. Why should we trust you?

27:55.586 --> 27:56.931
You shouldn't.

27:56.931 --> 27:58.310
You shouldn't trust anyone,
really.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.379
Okay, who tried to kill him?

28:01.379 --> 28:03.206
We don't know.

28:03.206 --> 28:05.344
I'm not sure I'm buying this.

28:05.344 --> 28:07.827
- Okay.
Look, how would I know that

28:07.827 --> 28:09.241
he has the pillow top
of the mattress

28:09.241 --> 28:10.965
if Diane didn't tell me?

28:10.965 --> 28:13.000
- Why are we at
the White House?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.965
- No better place
than right under his nose.

28:14.965 --> 28:16.896
No, no, this is reckless.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.034
- You know,
I agree with Bobby for once.

28:20.034 --> 28:21.482
It is.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.620
Look, if they knew that I knew
any of this,

28:23.620 --> 28:25.206
I'd be dead and so would you.

28:25.206 --> 28:27.586
But, I promise you, there is a
small group of us here

28:27.586 --> 28:29.586
who are trying our best to
get this man out of office

28:29.586 --> 28:31.206
and protect the nation.

28:31.206 --> 28:33.655
He's a danger to the world
and to us.

28:33.655 --> 28:35.034
Okay.

28:35.034 --> 28:38.482
So, what do you expect us
to do about it?

28:38.482 --> 28:40.103
- I'll make you both members
of my cabinet

28:40.103 --> 28:42.448
if you help me pull this off.

28:42.448 --> 28:44.068
How?

28:44.068 --> 28:47.172
- Testify. Give me all the info
you have.

28:47.172 --> 28:49.206
And if we say no?

28:49.206 --> 28:50.448
- Then it won't matter,
'cause this man

28:50.448 --> 28:53.068
will destroy life
as we know it.

28:53.068 --> 28:55.793
Look, I'm just looking for
some patriots here, guys,

28:55.793 --> 28:57.103
like you, Max.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.137
You're a golden boy.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.517
I know you probably think
that this is bullshit,

29:01.517 --> 29:03.827
but I promise you, there are
some of us here

29:03.827 --> 29:05.758
who are trying
to do the right thing.

29:05.758 --> 29:08.103
And you're that someone?

29:08.103 --> 29:10.137
Yes, I am.

29:11.551 --> 29:16.000
- See, I hate to break it to
you, but I didn't vote for him.

29:16.000 --> 29:17.379
I know.

29:17.379 --> 29:18.965
- I didn't vote
for his ass neither.

29:18.965 --> 29:23.000
- Guys, please.
I need your help.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.172
The decision's all yours,
but I need you guys.

29:27.551 --> 29:30.379
- So you want us to help you
overthrow--

29:30.379 --> 29:32.206
- The president?
- That's what I said.

29:32.206 --> 29:34.448
- Oh.
- No.

29:34.448 --> 29:37.758
I want you to help me get
an evil person out of office.

29:37.758 --> 29:39.344
And you're not?

29:39.344 --> 29:44.551
- No, what, evil?
God, I hope not.

29:44.551 --> 29:47.379
Okay. Okay.

29:47.379 --> 29:51.655
So, we can just walk
on out of here, then?

29:51.655 --> 29:54.448
- Well, we'll have the van
take you guys off the property,

29:54.448 --> 29:55.862
set you guys free.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.862
- Yeah, I want to do that.
Definitely want to do that.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.793
- We.
- We want to do that.

30:00.793 --> 30:03.793
- Okay.
But think about my offer.

30:03.793 --> 30:05.827
My number's in both your phones.

30:05.827 --> 30:08.137
So we can just go?

30:08.137 --> 30:13.068
- Yeah.
And uh, follow these gentlemen,

30:13.068 --> 30:15.448
and uh, thank you
for your time.

30:15.448 --> 30:18.551
And uh, I wouldn't go back
to that abandoned house.

30:18.551 --> 30:21.206
If my guys can find you,
I'm sure his can, too.

30:21.206 --> 30:23.551
- I told you that was bullshit.
That was a bullshit plan,

30:23.551 --> 30:26.137
you gonna learn to listen to me
one day, I'm telling you.

30:26.137 --> 30:28.241
- And I'd stay away from the
chief of staff's attic.

30:28.241 --> 30:29.862
I know he'll
find out about that.

30:29.862 --> 30:33.241
Uh oh. Now who's the dipshit?

30:33.241 --> 30:35.517
Aw, that would be you.

30:41.655 --> 30:43.965
Agent.

30:43.965 --> 30:48.448
Look guys,
I need you to find him, okay?

30:48.448 --> 30:50.793
Don't tell Sam or any of
the other agents.

30:50.793 --> 30:53.206
You guys do it for me?

30:53.206 --> 30:55.620
Alright, do it,
get out of here.

31:10.137 --> 31:12.724
I'm outside his door.

31:18.655 --> 31:20.103
You're alive.

31:20.103 --> 31:22.206
You have no idea.

31:22.206 --> 31:24.103
What? He's a kid.

31:24.103 --> 31:26.068
He's a monster.

31:26.068 --> 31:28.931
Yeah? What do you mean?

31:28.931 --> 31:32.862
- He's gonna try to play all
types of mind games with you.

31:32.862 --> 31:34.275
Okay.

31:34.275 --> 31:38.344
- And he's gonna watch
so much damn porn.

31:38.344 --> 31:40.310
That's my kind of job.

31:40.310 --> 31:42.965
- Yeah, well I'm glad to be
getting out of there.

31:42.965 --> 31:46.551
- Yeah. So uh--
- Man.

31:46.551 --> 31:48.620
Anything else I need to know?

31:50.482 --> 31:53.551
- You need to be
direct with him.

31:53.551 --> 31:56.965
He tried to urinate on me,
and I hit him.

31:56.965 --> 31:59.172
- You did?
- Yeah.

31:59.172 --> 32:00.724
What'd he do?

32:00.724 --> 32:03.896
- He went crying to his mom
like a little bitch.

32:03.896 --> 32:06.586
And uh, what did she say?

32:06.586 --> 32:09.310
- She said,
"Hit him again." Yeah.

32:09.310 --> 32:12.379
- Damn.
- Yeah, she's a gangster.

32:12.379 --> 32:15.758
- Yeah, yeah,
I like that about her.

32:15.758 --> 32:17.931
You know her?

32:17.931 --> 32:20.655
- Yeah, I've known her
for a while.

32:20.655 --> 32:22.241
Oh, it's like that?

32:22.241 --> 32:27.206
- Come on, man, work-wise.
- Yeah, okay.

32:27.206 --> 32:30.689
- So, anything else
I need to know?

32:32.655 --> 32:37.000
- Don't slip for one second.
- Got it.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.862
I'll see you.

32:39.862 --> 32:42.413
- Goodnight.
- Night.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.206
Who are you?

32:56.206 --> 32:58.448
Sorry if I woke you, sir.

33:03.931 --> 33:09.034
- Are they really doing shifts?
- I'm afraid so, sir.

33:09.034 --> 33:10.827
Great.

33:10.827 --> 33:12.931
Sorry, sir.

33:12.931 --> 33:15.896
- So, what?
You're gonna, you're gonna

33:15.896 --> 33:17.793
watch me piss, too?

33:17.793 --> 33:22.551
- Sir, I'm not going to
take my eyes off of you.

33:22.551 --> 33:24.931
- You look like
you'll enjoy that.

33:24.931 --> 33:29.413
- You will also learn that
I have no sense of humor.

33:29.413 --> 33:32.724
- So what?
You gonna hit me too?

33:32.724 --> 33:34.620
If I have to.

33:34.620 --> 33:38.551
- So that's what you guys do,
you abuse kids?

33:38.551 --> 33:42.034
Only kids that abuse us, sir.

33:42.034 --> 33:44.862
You seem really trained.

33:44.862 --> 33:46.689
Thank you, sir.

33:46.689 --> 33:48.482
- So how come I haven't
seen you before?

33:48.482 --> 33:51.172
I'm from a different squad.

33:51.172 --> 33:54.275
- What, Secret Service?
- Yes, sir.

33:54.275 --> 33:57.862
- Huh.
You have a gun?

33:57.862 --> 34:00.344
Yes, sir.

34:00.344 --> 34:04.724
- Bet I can take it from you.
- I doubt that, sir.

34:04.724 --> 34:07.965
- I bet that I can make you
give it to me.

34:07.965 --> 34:10.275
I doubt that too, sir.

34:10.275 --> 34:12.482
Okay.

34:12.482 --> 34:16.862
Yeah, when I, when I do
make you give it to me,

34:16.862 --> 34:19.482
I'll just remind you that
we had this conversation.

34:19.482 --> 34:23.482
Okay, you do that.

34:23.482 --> 34:25.758
- How big is your --?

34:25.758 --> 34:28.172
- No matter what shocking
thing you try,

34:28.172 --> 34:30.448
it won't work, sir.

34:30.448 --> 34:34.689
- So probably small, right?
Like my dad's?

34:34.689 --> 34:36.896
You know,
that's really a thing, um,

34:36.896 --> 34:40.724
guys with big bravados,
all this macho energy like this,

34:40.724 --> 34:44.034
they usually have tiny,
little, teeny bitty,

34:44.034 --> 34:47.275
teeny teeny teeny --.

34:47.275 --> 34:50.689
- Sir, you really should
go to sleep.

34:50.689 --> 34:54.862
- Oh yeah? What are you
gonna do about it?

34:54.862 --> 35:00.172
- Well, if you'd like,
I can put you to sleep.

35:00.172 --> 35:01.758
What?

35:01.758 --> 35:05.655
- Yes, yes,
it's a move that I know.

35:05.655 --> 35:10.517
I will have you asleep
and not talking in four seconds.

35:10.517 --> 35:13.275
If you'd like, I can...

35:13.275 --> 35:14.896
Don't you dare touch me.

35:14.896 --> 35:19.034
- Then maybe you should
go to sleep.

35:30.827 --> 35:33.172
- Bobby?
- Yeah?

35:33.172 --> 35:35.482
- Oh god,
I was worried to death.

35:35.482 --> 35:37.103
I'm fine.

35:37.103 --> 35:38.758
Okay, what happened?

35:38.758 --> 35:41.793
- Can't tell you over the phone.
- Okay.

35:41.793 --> 35:45.448
- When are you coming back?
- As soon as I can.

35:45.448 --> 35:48.517
I'm fine, Lilly.

35:48.517 --> 35:52.827
- I know, I'm just um,
I'm so relieved.

35:52.827 --> 35:54.448
I'm sorry.

35:55.793 --> 35:57.689
- Well, did everything go
as planned?

35:57.689 --> 36:01.000
- Yeah. It's all good.
- Okay.

36:04.413 --> 36:06.896
- You should go.
He's coming through the door.

36:06.896 --> 36:09.275
- How do you know that?
- Call me when you can.

36:09.275 --> 36:11.517
Oh, okay.

36:28.758 --> 36:31.482
What are you doing here?

36:31.482 --> 36:34.448
- Where else am I gonna go,
Ellie?

36:36.448 --> 36:38.586
- Allan, what happened
to the apartment?

36:38.586 --> 36:42.275
- Really, Ellie?
Leave me alone, okay?

36:42.275 --> 36:43.896
Okay.

36:43.896 --> 36:48.448
So, what?
You don't want to move out,

36:48.448 --> 36:50.724
but you just stay
and break all my shit?

36:50.724 --> 36:53.413
- Ellie, I'm just gonna ask you
one more time,

36:53.413 --> 36:55.724
leave me alone.

36:55.724 --> 36:58.206
- Allan, I left you alone.
I wasn't even here.

36:58.206 --> 37:00.586
I've been working at that
White House all night

37:00.586 --> 37:03.931
on the assassination attempt,
and I come home to this?

37:03.931 --> 37:07.103
- You know you're in danger,
right?

37:07.103 --> 37:08.655
- If you're gonna
do something to me Allan,

37:08.655 --> 37:10.931
then just do it,
but do not threaten me.

37:10.931 --> 37:13.103
- I'm not
- - threatening you.

37:13.103 --> 37:16.172
- It's really starting
to sound like it.

37:16.172 --> 37:19.241
- Aren't you gonna even
ask what happened to me? Hm?

37:19.241 --> 37:21.586
For once?

37:27.068 --> 37:29.206
No, I'm not.

37:29.206 --> 37:31.310
- Really?
- Really.

37:31.310 --> 37:33.448
Okay.

37:33.448 --> 37:36.137
After everything
I've done for you.

37:37.586 --> 37:38.827
- Here we go again,
after everything--

37:38.827 --> 37:40.137
Yeah, here we go again!

37:40.137 --> 37:41.965
- What do you want from me,
Allan, what?

37:41.965 --> 37:44.103
It's called
a relationship, okay?

37:44.103 --> 37:45.862
I told you it was over,
I asked you to leave,

37:45.862 --> 37:47.931
and you refuse to leave,
so what?

37:47.931 --> 37:52.517
- I'm not leaving here, Ellie!
Get that through your head!

37:58.965 --> 38:02.896
- I can't do this
anymore, Allan.

38:02.896 --> 38:06.793
Do what you want.
Stay, don't stay.

38:09.137 --> 38:11.172
I'm going to bed.

38:13.827 --> 38:16.620
- He's not going to
take care of you, Ellie.

38:22.172 --> 38:24.206
I don't care anymore.

38:28.517 --> 38:32.827
- You will.
You will.

38:36.620 --> 38:39.931
- Honey, I'm home.
- Hi.

38:41.551 --> 38:45.586
How are you? Hm?

38:45.586 --> 38:48.344
- I'm okay.
- Yeah?

38:48.344 --> 38:50.172
And...

38:52.620 --> 38:55.482
how was your day
with the First Lady? Hm?

38:55.482 --> 38:58.689
Oh it uh, it went well.

38:58.689 --> 39:00.448
Did she like the dresses?

39:00.448 --> 39:02.689
Several.

39:02.689 --> 39:05.896
- And why did she need them
all of the sudden?

39:05.896 --> 39:08.827
- Oh, she's meeting with
the Second Lady tomorrow.

39:08.827 --> 39:11.448
- Oh, ah, I didn't know
that was on her schedule.

39:11.448 --> 39:15.620
- Well it is, apparently.
- I see.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.068
- You know, I think
she'll look nice.

39:17.068 --> 39:19.413
- Yeah, that's good,
that's good.

39:21.206 --> 39:24.103
- Yeah, well,
I'm gonna go to bed.

39:24.103 --> 39:27.965
- Wait wait, no hugs?
No kisses?

39:27.965 --> 39:31.965
- Well, like I said,
I'm gonna go to bed.

39:31.965 --> 39:36.655
- Oh no, no, no, no, no,
not so fast.

39:36.655 --> 39:39.068
Donald, I'm tired.

39:39.068 --> 39:42.344
- Yeah, so am I,
I'm tired, baby.

39:42.344 --> 39:44.758
- Well, why don't you go
get some rest upstairs?

39:44.758 --> 39:47.310
- Yeah, I'm tired,
I am tired of your lies,

39:47.310 --> 39:49.103
I'm tired of your bullshit.

39:49.103 --> 39:50.862
- Yeah, well that makes
two of us.

39:50.862 --> 39:52.482
- Why did you have him
at the White House?

39:52.482 --> 39:54.827
- Who?
- Bobby. Your boyfriend.

39:54.827 --> 39:56.724
Why? Why would you do that?

39:56.724 --> 40:00.344
- Why is your boyfriend
at the White House?

40:00.344 --> 40:02.724
- Do you know that I can have
you arrested right now?

40:02.724 --> 40:06.655
- For?
- For getting him access.

40:06.655 --> 40:08.724
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

40:08.724 --> 40:12.896
- We're gonna find him.
- Okay, then do it.

40:12.896 --> 40:16.310
- We are turning that place
upside down right now.

40:16.310 --> 40:19.241
- Good, then you'll see
that he's not there.

40:19.241 --> 40:21.000
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
he's there,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.586
- and when we find him--
- Okay, goodnight, Donald.

40:23.586 --> 40:27.103
- You are going to jail, baby,
yes you are.

40:27.103 --> 40:30.206
Then we all are,

40:30.206 --> 40:32.206
honey.

41:45.724 --> 41:47.931
The mayor is my mother.

41:47.931 --> 41:51.689
- Do what I ask you to do, and
she'll be fine at home.

41:51.689 --> 41:53.620
Barry!

41:53.620 --> 41:55.724
- Oh.
- Who is this?

41:55.724 --> 41:57.517
Uh...

41:57.517 --> 42:00.103
- Hi, Dale.
- Where is Sharon?

42:00.103 --> 42:01.896
She's not coming home tonight.

42:01.896 --> 42:03.137
- Fair warning,
things are about to get

42:03.137 --> 42:04.793
really intense around here.

42:04.793 --> 42:07.034
What are you doing up here?

42:07.034 --> 42:09.931
Oh, what is this?

42:09.931 --> 42:13.379
- Oh baby, you are gonna tell us
everything.
