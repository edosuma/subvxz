00:10.245 --> 00:11.212
(screams)

00:13.348 --> 00:15.015
(Baldwin screams)

00:41.276 --> 00:43.478
(screams)

00:46.213 --> 00:48.215
(crying)

00:50.285 --> 00:51.552
CORDELIA:
It's over.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.924
We know who you are.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.460
Your allies are all dead.

00:59.494 --> 01:01.195
You failed.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.265
I've already proven to you
that I can defy death.

01:04.299 --> 01:05.633
I'm just gonna bring her back.

01:05.666 --> 01:09.737
And when I do, my Ms. Mead will
stand by me as we watch you die.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.940
You can certainly go to Hell,
but you won't find her there.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.709
What have you done?

01:14.742 --> 01:17.612
Her soul is hidden
by a spell only I can break.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.281
You'll never see her again.

01:22.317 --> 01:23.818
You're alone.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.320
(voice breaking):
I'm never alone.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.323
I have my father.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.224
Where is he now?

01:30.257 --> 01:32.327
Why did he let this happen?

01:32.360 --> 01:34.395
You don't have to follow
this path

01:34.429 --> 01:36.331
your father laid out for you.

01:36.364 --> 01:38.333
You can write your own destiny.

01:38.366 --> 01:41.336
You can still turn away.

01:41.369 --> 01:44.238
There's humanity in you.

01:44.271 --> 01:48.142
I see it.

01:48.175 --> 01:51.946
If you come with me,

01:51.979 --> 01:55.950
maybe we can find it.

01:58.218 --> 02:00.521
Together.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.770
Somehow,

02:15.803 --> 02:19.540
some way, I am gonna
bring her back.

02:19.574 --> 02:23.411
And then I'm gonna kill
every last one of you.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.758
*

03:07.221 --> 03:09.424
*

04:05.646 --> 04:07.648
*

04:17.858 --> 04:21.462
I'm not going any further.

04:21.496 --> 04:25.432
Father, tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

04:29.504 --> 04:33.307
I'm not leaving this circle
until you talk to me.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.843
They're gone. The warlocks,

04:35.876 --> 04:38.613
my Ms. Mead.

04:40.615 --> 04:44.752
Burned alive at the stake
by the witches.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.455
(panting):
Until nothing was left

04:48.489 --> 04:52.493
but ash and smoke.

04:57.197 --> 05:00.467
You tell me what to do...

05:00.501 --> 05:03.470
or you let me die here.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.749
(birds cawing)

05:21.922 --> 05:23.891
(child laughs)

05:29.163 --> 05:30.831
Would you like a grape Fanta?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.468
Would you like
a grape Fanta?

05:34.501 --> 05:38.405
-No, I'm on a mission.
-GIRL: You're hungry.

05:38.438 --> 05:40.174
You need nourishment.
Take an apple.

05:40.207 --> 05:43.510
It's so juicy. It's so juicy.

05:44.779 --> 05:47.381
I have to talk to my father.

05:47.414 --> 05:49.516
You don't have-- you don't have
to do anything. All are welcome.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.052
Come to the light.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.590
Leave me alone.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.692
(Ã  la The Exorcist):
Why you do this to me?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.561
You left me to die. To burn.

06:00.595 --> 06:01.929
To burn.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.363
I'm afraid.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.531
I'm afraid.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.434
You're not real.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.403
None of this is re-real.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.438
Don't listen to her.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.574
You've done a great job.

06:13.608 --> 06:14.709
LANGDON:
No.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.377
I failed.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.547
I'm lost.
I don't understand my purpose.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.850
You're everything we expected.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.252
The Alpha and the Omega.

06:25.285 --> 06:28.222
Who is, who was,

06:28.255 --> 06:30.524
and who is to come.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.059
Liar!

06:32.827 --> 06:34.795
God loves you.

06:41.636 --> 06:42.970
(goat bleats)

06:47.507 --> 06:49.443
Are you my father?

06:49.476 --> 06:50.577
(goat bleats)

06:59.987 --> 07:01.689
(hissing)

07:08.128 --> 07:11.598
What do you want from me?!

07:11.632 --> 07:14.101
What am I supposed to do?!

07:15.135 --> 07:18.138
Fuck am I supposed to do?

07:21.441 --> 07:23.443
(siren wailing in distance)

07:45.632 --> 07:47.634
*

08:01.148 --> 08:03.150
You lost?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.704
(door locks)

08:23.738 --> 08:25.973
(congregation chanting)

08:26.006 --> 08:27.975
HANNAH:
People.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.643
Listen the fuck up.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.813
Just because we have a president
who's a total douchenozzle

08:32.847 --> 08:35.549
and global warming
is getting worse,

08:35.582 --> 08:39.486
that doesn't mean you can
sit here on your lazy asses

08:39.519 --> 08:42.156
and holler out
a few "Hail Satans."

08:42.189 --> 08:43.657
You think end-time's
just gonna show up

08:43.690 --> 08:45.392
like a herpes sore?

08:45.425 --> 08:49.396
So tired of preaching
to the goddamn choir.

08:49.429 --> 08:53.400
What aren't you getting?
You know the drill.

08:53.433 --> 08:57.071
The Antichrist is gonna ride in
on a wave of sin,

08:57.104 --> 09:00.540
and all we have here
is a weak piss dribble.

09:00.574 --> 09:04.111
Somebody, please help me out.
I'm about ready

09:04.144 --> 09:05.913
to gouge out my own eyes
so I don't have to look

09:05.946 --> 09:09.750
at this weak-ass congregation
anymore.

09:09.784 --> 09:12.519
I need to hear some sins.

09:12.552 --> 09:16.190
I need to feel
we're making way for him.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.758
You.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.627
What are your sins?

09:20.660 --> 09:23.563
What did you do
to usher him in this week?

09:23.597 --> 09:26.433
I stole a hundred dollars
from my register at work.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.103
HANNAH: Seriously?
A fucking rounding error?

09:29.136 --> 09:30.771
(chuckles):
You think that's gonna open up

09:30.805 --> 09:32.773
the Gates of Hell?

09:32.807 --> 09:36.043
-I slept with my wife's sister.
-I've seen bad face-lifts

09:36.076 --> 09:38.012
that are more evil than you.

09:39.914 --> 09:41.882
You want to know
what I did this week?

09:41.916 --> 09:44.151
You want to be inspired?

09:44.184 --> 09:48.588
You want to know how
I'm helping bring end-times?

09:48.622 --> 09:50.324
I robbed a nursing home

09:50.357 --> 09:53.928
and I gave all the money
to the NRA.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.231
Next week
I need to feel some evil.

09:57.264 --> 10:01.735
I need to be repulsed.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.439
I need to feel sick
to my stomach.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.508
I want to be inspired!

10:09.844 --> 10:12.679
(sighs)
Whatever. Okay.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.615
Let's speak in tongues
for a hot sec and...

10:15.649 --> 10:18.652
show some respect.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.221
(congregation murmuring
indistinctly)

10:23.390 --> 10:26.393
I don't have any money
right now.

10:27.694 --> 10:30.097
Or any food
from the looks of it.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.666
(murmuring continues)

10:34.668 --> 10:36.937
How long has it been
since you ate, kid?

10:36.971 --> 10:38.772
(Langdon sighs)

10:38.805 --> 10:41.508
What's it to you?

10:41.541 --> 10:42.877
Just...

10:42.910 --> 10:46.780
trying to help out
a fellow believer.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.049
You know...

10:49.083 --> 10:52.186
after the service...

10:52.219 --> 10:54.855
I could fix you something.

10:54.889 --> 10:58.225
My place is only
a couple of blocks from here.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.628
That's actually
really nice of you.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.763
What can I say?

11:05.065 --> 11:07.935
Nobody's perfect.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.885
What's your name, kid?

11:28.923 --> 11:30.757
Michael.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.826
You must have been starving.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.862
I seen a lot of young people
like you come to our church

11:35.896 --> 11:39.833
off the five stars on Yelp and
the free doughnut at check-in.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.536
They all had
the same look you do.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.239
Scared. Searching.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.475
Questioning what the hell
this all means.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.880
So...

11:53.914 --> 11:55.715
what's your story?

11:55.749 --> 11:58.452
How did you end up all alone

11:58.485 --> 12:01.922
and at our beloved
Satan's doorstep?

12:01.956 --> 12:04.158
My father abandoned me.

12:05.993 --> 12:08.528
And my mother tried to kill me.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.064
Humanity...

12:10.097 --> 12:13.934
is shit.

12:13.968 --> 12:17.904
This world is
a twisted black hole

12:17.938 --> 12:19.606
of sin and chaos,

12:19.639 --> 12:24.278
and that's why Satanism is
the way of the future.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.982
We are the fastest-growing
religion in the world,

12:28.015 --> 12:30.884
so we need people like you--

12:30.917 --> 12:33.753
bright, eager,
the next generation--

12:33.787 --> 12:35.922
to help spread the word
of Lucifer.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.492
'Cause here's
the beautiful secret, babe.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.961
Once you embrace
that at our core

12:40.995 --> 12:44.431
we are degenerate,
rotten beings,

12:44.464 --> 12:46.800
every last one of us...

12:46.833 --> 12:50.004
you'll be free.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.406
Satanism...

12:52.439 --> 12:54.908
is about giving in
to your urges,

12:54.941 --> 12:58.979
embracing sin, your true nature.

12:59.013 --> 13:01.748
I sold my soul to the Devil,

13:01.781 --> 13:05.852
and he gave me
everything I ever wanted.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.921
You sold your soul?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.624
Did you sign a contract
in blood?

13:10.657 --> 13:14.128
I made a deal in a Black Mass,
as one does.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.996
Through prayer.

13:16.030 --> 13:18.198
And by prayer--
I mean...

13:18.232 --> 13:20.767
killing people-- it works.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.004
You're standing in the proof.

13:24.038 --> 13:26.806
I offered up my soul, and...

13:26.840 --> 13:29.343
he gave me all this.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.012
Riches beyond compare.
(chuckles)

13:32.046 --> 13:35.282
I've got a... a La-Z-Boy,

13:35.315 --> 13:39.819
a-a cable package
with all the premium channels.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.122
I shoot up heroin

13:42.156 --> 13:44.858
as much as I want,
and I never get the sweats.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.994
And every Wednesday night
Brad Pitt comes over

13:48.028 --> 13:50.197
and fucks me
till the sun comes up.

13:51.865 --> 13:55.269
On Friday nights
I get Ryan Reynolds.

13:57.071 --> 14:00.074
So that's all it is, then.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.581
Satan is carnal pleasure.

14:07.614 --> 14:10.016
(chuckles)

14:10.050 --> 14:11.985
Hell no.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.054
We've got a greater purpose.

14:14.088 --> 14:17.991
We are moving towards
the beginning of the end.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.993
Our savior is coming.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.862
The spawn of Satan will...

14:22.896 --> 14:26.032
lead us off the cliff
and into the end-times.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.703
We just have to make things
terrible enough for him to rise.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.072
We are the fetid,

14:32.106 --> 14:34.074
rancid, contaminated soil

14:34.108 --> 14:37.411
from which he will bloom.
(panting)

14:37.444 --> 14:39.846
And then plunge us

14:39.879 --> 14:42.116
in eternal darkness

14:42.149 --> 14:46.553
so that we can walk with Satan
in eternal hellfire.

14:48.155 --> 14:51.024
I hate to break it to you...

14:51.057 --> 14:54.060
but you're waiting in vain.

14:57.131 --> 14:59.933
What are you talking about?

15:03.770 --> 15:06.540
I'm the one you're waiting for.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.942
How dare you blaspheme!

15:08.975 --> 15:13.113
Well, before you kill me,
dear believer...

15:13.147 --> 15:14.481
see me.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.154
(gasps)

15:21.821 --> 15:23.123
(knife drops to floor)

15:23.157 --> 15:25.925
Hail Satan!

15:25.959 --> 15:28.762
Our savior has risen!

15:28.795 --> 15:31.998
*

15:32.031 --> 15:33.066
(thunder crashes)

15:33.099 --> 15:35.169
CHOIR:

15:35.202 --> 15:37.337

15:37.371 --> 15:38.738

16:12.872 --> 16:14.374
(holding last note)

16:14.408 --> 16:16.943
-(music ends)
-Ladies and gentlemen,

16:16.976 --> 16:20.180
the volunteer All-Sinners choir!

16:20.214 --> 16:22.249
(cheering)

16:23.983 --> 16:27.954
They really know how to raise
some hell, don't they, kids?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.790
OTHERS:
Hail Satan!

16:30.824 --> 16:34.361
And, you ask, why does it rain
every time they sing?

16:34.394 --> 16:37.831
Because God is pissing
in his pants.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.133
OTHERS:
Hail Satan!

16:40.166 --> 16:43.570
Well, now that we're
in the mood,

16:43.603 --> 16:48.208
are you ready for an
old-fashioned human sacrifice?

16:48.242 --> 16:51.245
-OTHERS: Yeah!
-Black Mass...

16:51.278 --> 16:53.046
you are everything!

16:57.617 --> 16:59.719
(muffled sobbing)

17:02.256 --> 17:04.858
This is Leticia.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.860
She is a social worker.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.563
And she's dedicated
her entire life

17:09.596 --> 17:12.699
to easing the suffering
of those less fortunate.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.701
Bitch, please.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.202
(laughter)

17:16.236 --> 17:18.104
Theodore...

17:18.137 --> 17:22.208
is a lifelong member
of Doctors Without Borders.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.379
-(muffled whimpering)
-Isn't that just too precious?

17:27.247 --> 17:30.016
Minus the two of them,
I think the world will be

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
a little bit shittier.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.255
So why waste any more time?

17:37.557 --> 17:40.360
The honor
of today's killing goes

17:40.394 --> 17:42.228
to a new member-- Phil.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.198
MAN:
Go, Phil!

17:45.231 --> 17:49.403
Phil, tell us a little something
about yourself.

17:49.436 --> 17:53.307
Well, I was
the chief accountant at Gawker

17:53.340 --> 17:54.908
before, you know...

17:54.941 --> 17:58.244
-that whole thing.
-Ugh! Ouch.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.213
Then my girlfriend left me,

18:00.246 --> 18:03.950
and my life turned to shit...

18:03.983 --> 18:06.553
until I saw the darkness.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.089
Are you ready
to pledge your soul to Satan?

18:10.123 --> 18:12.459
(sighs):
Am I ever.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.128
They're all yours.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.331
Hail Satan!

18:17.364 --> 18:19.333
OTHERS:
Hail Satan!

18:19.366 --> 18:20.934
Hail Satan.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.269
Don't let me down, Phil.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.138
(muffled whimpering)

18:25.171 --> 18:26.673
MADELYN:
Wait!

18:27.774 --> 18:30.243
This honor belongs
to someone else.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.146
Someone else?

18:33.179 --> 18:34.848
His name is Michael.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.516
He's...

18:36.550 --> 18:38.318
new here.

18:38.352 --> 18:40.787
(congregation murmuring)

18:40.820 --> 18:42.989
Well, even if he's willing
to sell his soul,

18:43.022 --> 18:44.924
why should he go before...?

18:44.958 --> 18:49.363
Michael doesn't need
to sell his soul.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.935
The end-times

18:55.969 --> 18:59.172
are upon us.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.144
Behold.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.313
(lightning crashes)

19:07.347 --> 19:09.349
The mark of the beast.

19:11.351 --> 19:15.021
Is it possible that...

19:15.054 --> 19:16.356
you're the one?

19:16.390 --> 19:17.357
I am.

19:17.391 --> 19:20.560
ALL:
Hail Satan.

19:30.269 --> 19:35.509
* O Fortuna

19:35.542 --> 19:41.381
* Velut luna

19:41.415 --> 19:42.549
(whimpering)

19:42.582 --> 19:44.551
* Statu

19:44.584 --> 19:50.223
* Variabilis.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.533
(applause)

19:59.566 --> 20:03.470
-Hail Satan!
-ALL: Hail Satan!

20:17.316 --> 20:20.286
Is it too spicy?

20:20.319 --> 20:23.189
No. It's good.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.758
Oh, thank the Dark Lord.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.626
It's my mother's recipe.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.361
Now try the macaroni salad.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.396
No, the turkey meatballs.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.198
HANNAH:
May I touch your hair?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.367
MADELYN:
Let the kid eat.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.470
O-Or is something wrong?

20:36.503 --> 20:39.473
What can we get you?
What can we do?

20:39.506 --> 20:43.209
I just think everyone should do
what you normally do.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.411
Have fun.

20:45.445 --> 20:50.049
Enjoy your Wednesday
potluck dinner like always.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.485
You heard him.

20:51.518 --> 20:55.489
Our guest of honor eats
at his own pace.

20:55.522 --> 20:58.424
(soft chatter)

20:58.458 --> 21:00.460
(chuckles)

21:00.494 --> 21:04.731
Though I can personally vouch
for the spinach lasagna.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.502
It would be the honor of my life
to watch you eat it.

21:08.535 --> 21:12.506
So, what happens next?

21:14.541 --> 21:17.511
Probably your lasagna.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.078
(laughs)
No,

21:19.112 --> 21:22.315
I meant on
the global annihilation front.

21:22.348 --> 21:23.416
What do we do first?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.685
When do we do it?

21:25.719 --> 21:28.087
I'm not sure.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.857
What do you mean
you're not sure?

21:30.890 --> 21:33.459
I don't know what to do,

21:33.493 --> 21:35.529
where to begin.

21:35.562 --> 21:36.930
But you're the Antichrist.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.633
Which people
won't let me forget.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.701
Everyone keeps saying
that I'm special,

21:41.735 --> 21:44.538
that I'm the only one who
can bring about the end-times,

21:44.571 --> 21:47.541
but nobody gave me
a fucking instruction manual.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.475
And the one person
who always helped me,

21:49.509 --> 21:51.878
who I could always turn to
for advice,

21:51.911 --> 21:54.413
she's gone now.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.456
I have no one.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.659
Oh.

22:05.692 --> 22:09.395
I-I think there's some people
you need to see.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.466
Who?

22:13.499 --> 22:16.069
Just trust me.

22:16.102 --> 22:20.740
We are on the precipice
of oblivion, Michael.

22:20.774 --> 22:25.712
Now is not the time
to bury yourself in doubt.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.548
This person who helped you,

22:28.582 --> 22:31.384
what was her name?

22:31.417 --> 22:34.520
Ms. Miriam Mead.

22:34.554 --> 22:39.325
We have access
to private search engines

22:39.358 --> 22:42.161
that can find anyone.

22:42.195 --> 22:45.699
And... there she is.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.500
We'll just go and pick her up.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.503
It's not possible.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.406
I'm not powerful enough
to bring her back.

22:53.439 --> 22:56.710
Not anymore, at least.

22:57.711 --> 22:58.778
She's dead.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.581
Dead?

23:04.050 --> 23:07.721
That's something
we can work around.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.590
(chair scrapes)

23:12.592 --> 23:17.631
You are the son of Satan.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.566
There is no one

23:20.600 --> 23:23.569
or no thing

23:23.603 --> 23:27.206
you cannot have.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.408
-(gulls calling)
-LANGDON: I don't know why

23:29.442 --> 23:31.778
you won't just tell me
exactly where we're going.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.714
MADELYN (chuckles): I'm sorry.
I'm already a little freaked out

23:34.748 --> 23:38.417
I've said too much.
And you being who you are...

23:38.451 --> 23:40.586
(chuckles):
It's okay.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.622
You don't have to be nervous
around me.

23:42.656 --> 23:44.724
I'm the same guy I was
when you met me.

23:44.758 --> 23:48.327
(laughing):
That is so not true.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.297
Just tell me.

23:51.330 --> 23:53.232
Okay.

23:53.266 --> 23:56.435
We are, like,
this secret network.

23:56.469 --> 23:59.572
We all know each other.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.809
A secret network of people
who sold their souls.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.310
Yeah.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.245
And...

24:06.279 --> 24:09.248
if you think about this network
like it's a hotel,

24:09.282 --> 24:13.186
then I am taking you
to the penthouse.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.689
No one is gonna pass up a chance

24:15.722 --> 24:19.693
to meet the true son
of the most foul.

24:19.726 --> 24:23.629
If there is anyone who can help
get you back on track, they can.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.342
(shuts engine off)

24:47.887 --> 24:50.123
You're not coming with me?

24:50.156 --> 24:52.726
They're only interested in you.

24:52.759 --> 24:56.796
Just... go up the path
to the entrance.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.733
I really think
you're gonna be impressed.

24:59.766 --> 25:02.736
At least I hope so.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.839
Why are you so good to me?

25:05.872 --> 25:09.242
I've waited for you
my whole life.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.644
We all have.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.146
Could I ask you a favor?

25:13.179 --> 25:14.547
Anything.

25:14.580 --> 25:18.684
When you finally talk
to your father,

25:18.718 --> 25:22.355
could you maybe put in
a good word for me?

25:22.388 --> 25:24.257
When I get to Hell,

25:24.290 --> 25:27.060
I want to be
in the lowest circle.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.661
Circle?

25:28.694 --> 25:30.063
However it's structured,

25:30.096 --> 25:32.766
I want to be in the worst part.

25:32.799 --> 25:34.567
Or the best part.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.371
I want to burn
in blistering fire

25:38.404 --> 25:41.707
for all eternity in service.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.744
I'll see what I can do.

25:44.778 --> 25:47.213
-Okay?
-(giggles): Okay.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.951
Hail Satan!

25:51.985 --> 25:54.553
(chuckling)

26:11.170 --> 26:12.705
(grunts, sniffs)

26:12.738 --> 26:14.707
Tell me
that wasn't the last of it.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.976
I ordered more, bruh.
How you coming?

26:17.010 --> 26:18.812
Almost done.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.614
Okay.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.649
Let's try it.

26:26.853 --> 26:28.654
(whirring)

26:30.957 --> 26:33.827
(both chuckling)

26:33.860 --> 26:36.662
Holy shit, that's way better.
What'd you do?

26:36.695 --> 26:38.664
Eh, I tweaked the feedback
sensors on the finger joints

26:38.697 --> 26:40.233
and gave the lateral servos
a flush.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.001
The next auto-update,
all our Tiffany and Bambi users

26:42.035 --> 26:44.170
are going to be very happy.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.806
Fuck yeah, bro. I'm pitching
a tent just looking at that.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.641
Mm.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.776
-JEFF: Oh, shit!
-MUTT: Whoa, whoa!

26:50.810 --> 26:52.345
-Oh!
-Oh, oh! Well,

26:52.378 --> 26:55.181
5,000 of our clients
just got their dicks ripped off.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.616
-(laughs) It's okay, it's okay.
-(laughs)

26:57.650 --> 26:59.285
-I know what the problem is.
-Yeah, I know

26:59.318 --> 27:01.287
what my problem is--
I need another fix.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.823
Hey, babe, we're spiraling here.

27:03.857 --> 27:05.291
Do you have an ETA?

27:05.324 --> 27:06.926
Babe? Babe?

27:06.960 --> 27:08.694
Babe?

27:08.727 --> 27:11.030
VENABLE:
It's just arriving now.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.867
Terribly sorry for the delay.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.835
I'm so sorry, Ms. Venable.

27:15.869 --> 27:18.304
There was a bad accident
on the 101.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.107
Not as bad as the accident
that brought you into the world,

27:21.140 --> 27:22.441
I'm sure.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.510
I got back as fast as I could.

27:24.543 --> 27:26.712
You don't have
to insult me again.

27:26.745 --> 27:29.115
I certainly don't have to.

27:29.148 --> 27:34.888
But why deny myself one
of life's simple pleasures?

27:34.921 --> 27:37.656
Now set that down

27:37.690 --> 27:42.328
and summon all your brain cells
to clear your desk.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.901
Y-You can't treat people
like this.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.903
I'm gonna report you to HR.

27:49.936 --> 27:54.307
I am HR, bitch.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.843
And everything else that matters
around here, too.

27:57.877 --> 28:03.182
Now, do me a favor and get
the fuck out of my sight.

28:16.529 --> 28:21.067
("The Morning After"
by Maureen McGovern playing)

28:21.100 --> 28:22.868
MUTT:
Dude, this easy listening music

28:22.902 --> 28:24.537
you're always playing
is not helping.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.272
How many times do I have
to tell you,

28:26.305 --> 28:28.341
don't knock the playlist,
the playlist is everything.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.911
Light rock is soothing for me;
it is calming, it is focusing.

28:31.945 --> 28:34.948
Other than cocaine,
it is my cocaine.

28:34.981 --> 28:37.116
Ah. Yes.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.953
Oh, babe, you're a lifesaver.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.587
Hey, I was working.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.757
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.592
I forgot.

28:46.625 --> 28:50.863
* Oh, can't you see
the morning after? *

28:50.896 --> 28:52.731
MUTT:
Ha-ha.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.705
-Easy.
-(Mutt and Jeff snorting)

28:59.738 --> 29:00.906
CALL GIRL:
How do you guys not OD?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.742
Oh... hell if I know.

29:03.776 --> 29:06.412
-Devil of a mystery. (chuckles)
-VENABLE: The package

29:06.445 --> 29:09.315
of dog feces is on its way
to Mr. Zuckerberg's estate--

29:09.348 --> 29:10.984
fourth-class mail, of course.

29:11.017 --> 29:13.819
Rihanna's people called--
she'll be available all weekend,

29:13.852 --> 29:15.821
and I've already purchased
the island.

29:15.854 --> 29:18.557
-Oh, nice.
-Yes. Ms. Venable.

29:18.591 --> 29:20.626
What would our lives be
without you?

29:20.659 --> 29:22.761
Oh, I just can't imagine.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.897
(snorts) A lot less purple.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.932
Yeah, purple's Ms. Venable's
thing.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.135
Just as self-abasement is yours.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.769
(Jeff and Mutt laugh)

29:30.803 --> 29:33.272
-(whistles)
-(laughs)

29:35.108 --> 29:36.109
JEFF:
Zinger. Yeah.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.077
VENABLE:
Lastly, the front desk

29:38.111 --> 29:40.679
says there's a gentleman here
to see you.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.751
Apparently he claims
to have arranged this meeting

29:45.784 --> 29:47.753
-with you himself.
-Uh, yeah.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.024
If you could let him in
the private elevator, please?

29:51.057 --> 29:54.027
(snorting)

29:54.060 --> 29:55.828
VENABLE:
Certainly.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.305
Don't ever call me "babe."

30:10.976 --> 30:15.814
(scoffs) Sometimes, I swear,
she hates our guts.

30:17.250 --> 30:18.917
(elevator bell rings)

30:28.094 --> 30:30.096
(lock beeps, latch clicks)

30:40.706 --> 30:42.241
Dude.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.710
What's up?

30:44.743 --> 30:46.979
Come on in. (chuckles)
Dying to meet you.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.048
Yeah, Madelyn's really
been talking you up.

30:49.082 --> 30:52.851
-That lady is whacked, right?
-(both chuckle)

30:52.885 --> 30:56.255
But she seems totally convinced
that you're The One.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.591
No offense, but I thought you'd
be a little bit more jacked.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.426
Like, I was picturing you
totally ripped, like The--

31:00.459 --> 31:02.928
like The Rock when he was,
you know, The Rock.

31:02.961 --> 31:04.597
Yeah, that's, like,
stereotypical, dude.

31:04.630 --> 31:08.401
-What do you mean?
-Yeah, that's not cool.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.069
Uh, what's your name again?

31:10.103 --> 31:12.105
Michael.

31:12.138 --> 31:15.274
-Langdon.
-Michael Langdon.

31:15.308 --> 31:17.343
I mean, got to admit, that's
a little weak, right? (chuckles)

31:17.376 --> 31:19.078
JEFF (chuckles):
Yeah.

31:19.112 --> 31:20.846
Shouldn't you be like Beelzebub
or some shit like that?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.014
(Jeff and Mutt laugh)

31:22.047 --> 31:24.417
-Old Scratch?
-(laughing)

31:24.450 --> 31:26.619
-Oh, dude, dude, dude.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.053
-Wait. No, no, Dude. Dude.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey. Ho.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.255
-Dude, dude. No, no, no.
-Ho.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.056
No, no, no.
Uh, we-we-we believe you.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.192
It-- you know, I thought I'd be,
like, pissing my pants

31:33.226 --> 31:36.028
or something, and...

31:36.061 --> 31:38.097
I am dry as the Sahara, bro.

31:38.131 --> 31:40.065
JEFF: Yeah. You got to look
at it from our shoes here.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.868
I mean, how do we know
you're the Antichrist?

31:42.901 --> 31:44.737
Yeah, how do we know?

32:01.954 --> 32:03.889
Yeah, I mean, that's cool,

32:03.922 --> 32:06.091
but it's just a tattoo
on your scalp.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.927
No. It's true.
I can feel the darkness.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.197
It's making me sick
and it's coming from him.

32:15.201 --> 32:17.102
-Oh, shit!
-Holy shit!

32:21.106 --> 32:23.776
-(gasps)
-(pants)

32:23.809 --> 32:25.178
-Hail Satan.
-Hail Satan.

32:25.211 --> 32:27.780
JEFF AND MUTT:
Hail Satan.

32:27.813 --> 32:30.683
-Hail Satan.
-Satan, hail. Satan, hail.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.485
Dude, we owe everything
to your old man. Do you know

32:32.518 --> 32:34.520
how much time we wasted doing
the Silicon Valley grind

32:34.553 --> 32:37.356
-before we found our faith?
-For years we worked 20 hours

32:37.390 --> 32:39.325
a day in R&D for a company
whose nondisclosure agreements

32:39.358 --> 32:40.593
prevent us
from mentioning by name.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.927
But did Elon give us any credit?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.196
Any opportunity for advancement?

32:43.229 --> 32:45.264
-No!
-No! The fix is in, man.

32:45.298 --> 32:47.200
The world is run by prep school
failsons and Russian oligarchs.

32:47.233 --> 32:48.934
Everyone else just slaves away

32:48.967 --> 32:50.203
trying to make
these rich assholes richer.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.537
-Fuck that shit.
-Fuck it.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.138
-Fuck it.
-Fuck it.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.607
Why put in the work when there's
no reward, right?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.275
And then we learned the secret.

32:56.309 --> 32:58.010
The politicians,
the billionaires, the elite--

32:58.043 --> 33:00.145
they all made a deal to work
in his service.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.780
-My dad.
-MUTT (chuckles): Exactly.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.216
That's when we took
the plunge, too.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.318
Sold our souls. Did the whole
Black Mass thing.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.453
Now, we own
a robotics company worth...

33:07.486 --> 33:10.155
BOTH:
Billions.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.225
We inhale booger sugar
like it's fucking oxygen,

33:12.258 --> 33:15.127
and we bang Victoria's Secret
models every Tuesday.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.662
Fuck yeah.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.064
Thursdays we get Ryan Reynolds.

33:19.097 --> 33:22.235
MUTT: The point is, it would be
an honor to play even

33:22.268 --> 33:24.203
a small role in bringing
the cosmic skid mark

33:24.237 --> 33:26.339
that is Planet Earth
to a fiery end.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.341
JEFF:
We are your servants, Michael.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.376
Now and forever.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.646
How can we help, even
in the most microscopic of ways?

33:33.679 --> 33:36.014
I lost someone very dear to me.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.217
My one true ally.

33:38.251 --> 33:41.287
You want to help?
Bring her back.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.167
You came to the right place.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.204
Our AI tech makes HAL 9000
look like a fucking abacus.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.706
We can whip you up

34:00.739 --> 34:02.708
a new right-hand lickety-split,
player.

34:02.741 --> 34:04.076
You can?

34:04.109 --> 34:05.278
Tell us about her.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.280
Everything you can remember.

34:09.615 --> 34:12.251
(snorting)

34:12.285 --> 34:16.422
(sighs) No.
We owe him more than this.

34:16.455 --> 34:20.092
She's gonna be identical,
down to her final pube.

34:20.125 --> 34:21.794
No, it's not good enough, bro.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.729
Not when your client is
the spawn of Satan.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.097
Think.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.932
-I'm thinking!
-Think harder!

34:26.965 --> 34:29.034
-I'm thinking!
-Think faster!

34:29.067 --> 34:31.270
(panting)

34:31.304 --> 34:34.106
We need to make her Mossad.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.442
-Yeah!
-Mossad!

34:36.475 --> 34:37.910
JEFF:
Mossad!

34:37.943 --> 34:40.279
(machinery whirring)

34:46.752 --> 34:50.356
(whirring, beeping)

35:10.809 --> 35:13.479
MUTT:
240 terabytes of memory,

35:13.512 --> 35:16.915
over 11,000 processor cores.

35:16.949 --> 35:19.652
She could crush Watson at
Jeopardy! and kick the asses

35:19.685 --> 35:22.655
-of every roided actor in
the Expendables franchise.
-(Jeff chuckles)

35:22.688 --> 35:24.423
She's amazing.

35:24.457 --> 35:27.125
Why is she so cold?

35:27.159 --> 35:29.962
Oh, that'll change with the flip
of her "on" switch.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.365
She's got a nanowire-based
lithium ion battery.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.166
Basically the Energizer Bunny's
wet dream.

35:34.199 --> 35:37.436
We fire her up,
she goes on forever.

35:37.470 --> 35:40.205
MUTT: Just don't tell her
she's a biomechanical humanoid.

35:40.238 --> 35:42.107
At least not at first.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.677
It'll send her into the mother
of all existential crises.

35:44.710 --> 35:47.279
She could end up killing
herself, maybe others.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.548
Seriously, I've seen it happen.

35:49.582 --> 35:53.018
-Not worth the headache.
-(Mutt and Jeff chuckle)

35:54.353 --> 35:56.389
And now...

35:56.422 --> 36:01.126
Kineros Robotics proudly
presents...

36:01.159 --> 36:05.864
the Battle-Ax-- Miriam Mead 2.0.

36:08.367 --> 36:11.804
Now, don't expect her to be
her old self right away.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.972
It's gonna take her time.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.641
She needs to learn from you.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.476
Build a rapport.

36:17.510 --> 36:19.678
Like any relationship.

36:45.037 --> 36:47.440
How I've missed you, Michael.
