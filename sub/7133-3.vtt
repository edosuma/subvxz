13:48.734 --> 13:51.500
- So you were being altruistic?

13:51.567 --> 13:53.500
- Whatever.

13:53.567 --> 13:55.867
- So you weren't actually
committing a sin.

13:55.934 --> 13:57.734
- No, Father.

13:59.266 --> 14:01.200
- Then why did you come
to confession?

14:01.266 --> 14:04.033
- The truth?
- Sure.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.700
- I figured when I was done,
I could sneak a smoke.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.934
- They say
confession is good for the soul.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.033
You go into a confessional,

14:11.100 --> 14:13.133
and you can tell a priest
anything.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.300
Anything!

14:14.367 --> 14:16.967
And he can't repeat it.

14:17.033 --> 14:18.300
You go
into an interview room

14:18.367 --> 14:20.967
with your local PD
and say what you've done,

14:21.033 --> 14:22.967
well, the cops are telling
the DA and the papers

14:23.033 --> 14:24.533
and everybody else!

14:24.600 --> 14:25.700
So you do some deed,

14:25.767 --> 14:27.133
and you want
to clean your conscience

14:27.200 --> 14:29.500
and still get away with it?

14:29.567 --> 14:33.600
Well, tell your mama,
or tell a priest!

14:44.567 --> 14:46.200
- Psst.

14:46.266 --> 14:48.000
Psst!

14:48.066 --> 14:50.166
Hey, how you doing, man?

14:50.233 --> 14:51.300
- Okay.

14:51.367 --> 14:52.300
- Can you believe that shit

14:52.367 --> 14:53.834
that's going down around here?

14:53.900 --> 14:57.000
Three guys capped
in three weeks?

14:57.066 --> 14:59.000
It's fucked up.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.200
- Yep.

15:01.266 --> 15:02.834
- You're a lawyer, right?

15:04.767 --> 15:06.033
- I was disbarred automatically

15:06.100 --> 15:08.033
after I was convicted
of a felony.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.867
- Even so, how come
you ain't appealing your case

15:09.934 --> 15:11.633
and shit like that?

15:11.700 --> 15:14.300
- I did.
My appeal was rejected.

15:14.367 --> 15:15.533
- How come?

15:15.600 --> 15:17.633
- I was drunk driving.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.734
I killed a little girl.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.233
They decided
to make an example of me,

15:21.300 --> 15:24.033
so they sent me here instead
of some cushy Club Med.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.967
- Maybe you can help me out.

15:26.033 --> 15:27.800
My attorney was
a raging dick-brain.

15:27.867 --> 15:29.934
He just fuckin' rolled over
in court.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.467
Could you, um,
take a look at my case

15:32.533 --> 15:33.967
and see
if there's any way I can appeal?

15:34.033 --> 15:35.667
- I-I didn't do criminal law.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.200
I was in litigation.

15:37.266 --> 15:40.100
- I'm telling you, man,
I gotta get out of this place.

15:42.734 --> 15:45.667
- [sighs]
Okay.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.166
- Ryan O'Reilly.

15:48.233 --> 15:50.433
- Tobias Beecher.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.000
- When you pray,
do you go into a zone?

15:55.066 --> 15:58.000
Does the rest of the world
drop away?

15:58.066 --> 16:00.867
I never been there.
God in coma.

16:00.934 --> 16:02.300
I can say an "Our Father"

16:02.367 --> 16:04.333
and think about lunch
at the same time.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.500
all:
Our Father, who art in heaven...

16:07.567 --> 16:08.834
- Some people say

16:08.900 --> 16:10.533
that if you don't accept
Jesus Christ

16:10.600 --> 16:13.633
as the son of God,
as your personal savior,

16:13.700 --> 16:15.967
you won't go to heaven...

16:16.033 --> 16:17.300
but is there a guarantee

16:17.367 --> 16:18.967
that,
if you do believe in Jesus,

16:19.033 --> 16:20.633
you will be saved?

16:20.700 --> 16:23.300
Or will God,
the great practical joker,

16:23.367 --> 16:24.867
leave you hanging?

16:27.700 --> 16:30.467
- Hey, sweet pea.
How was church, huh?

16:30.533 --> 16:35.633
You feeling
all sanctified and pure?

16:35.700 --> 16:37.967
Get undressed.
We're taking a shower.

16:38.033 --> 16:40.467
- I already took a shower.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.333
- Oh, that's okay.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.433
- When I'm done with you,
you'll need another one.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.500
- So, my assistant got paroled.

16:52.567 --> 16:54.500
See, that's what's wrong
with this place:

16:54.567 --> 16:56.000
you finally break in
an assistant,

16:56.066 --> 16:57.667
he learns your rhythms,
he's good at the job,

16:57.734 --> 16:58.834
and then boom!

16:58.900 --> 17:00.000
The parole board decides

17:00.066 --> 17:01.500
that he's ready
to rejoin society.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.166
Meanwhile,
I am left with a stack

17:04.233 --> 17:06.667
of un-typed
psychiatric reports.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.467
- Sister, I'm glad
you thought of me for this job.

17:08.533 --> 17:09.867
I really wasn't suited
for factory work.

17:09.934 --> 17:13.433
- Oh, listen, when I heard
you knew Word and Lotus,

17:13.500 --> 17:15.967
I knelt down
and praised Jesus.

17:16.033 --> 17:18.133
- I'm lucky he heard you.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.967
He hasn't been listening to me.

17:20.033 --> 17:21.800
- Oh yes, he does.
He listens.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.967
- No, he doesn't.

17:24.033 --> 17:26.800
Since I got to Oz,
I've prayed more

17:26.867 --> 17:28.800
than the night
before my bar exam,

17:28.867 --> 17:33.300
more than the day
my son fell off his skateboard.

17:33.367 --> 17:36.600
Either God's hearing
has gotten bad, or...

17:36.667 --> 17:38.100
he's ignoring me.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.467
- No, listen, first of all,

17:39.533 --> 17:41.300
quantity of prayer
doesn't mean anything.

17:41.367 --> 17:44.300
And secondly,
maybe he has answered you,

17:44.367 --> 17:46.166
only it's not what you expect.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.834
- God Almighty,
creator of all things...

17:48.900 --> 17:51.000
including the loophole.

17:51.066 --> 17:53.667
- Come on.

17:53.734 --> 17:57.266
There's your desk,
such as it is.

18:02.066 --> 18:04.500
Tobias.

18:04.567 --> 18:07.333
What do you ask for
when you pray?

18:07.400 --> 18:09.500
- To get out of here.

18:09.567 --> 18:13.433
- Oh.
You don't need God for that.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.500
You just need a good lawyer.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.934
- I spent my life
dealing with the law,

18:20.000 --> 18:23.967
finding ways
over, under, around it.

18:24.033 --> 18:26.300
And then when I needed it
to be there for me,

18:26.367 --> 18:30.633
the system snapped back
into my face.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.467
I was a good lawyer.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.800
I was.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.133
I was a lot of things.

18:36.200 --> 18:39.467
A husband. Father.
Son. Brother.

18:39.533 --> 18:41.800
Friend.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.800
And then I made a mistake--
one huge, huge mistake,

18:44.867 --> 18:47.000
but one  mistake.

18:47.066 --> 18:50.633
And as a result...

18:50.700 --> 18:52.667
God took everything.

18:52.734 --> 18:56.000
- Listen,
maybe he stripped you

18:56.066 --> 18:59.000
of the superficial sense
of your self,

18:59.066 --> 19:01.166
you know,
doctor, lawyer, Indian chief,

19:01.233 --> 19:06.266
so that you could find
the real you through him.

19:06.333 --> 19:07.400
- That's what I'm saying.

19:07.467 --> 19:08.834
That's what I've
been trying to do,

19:08.900 --> 19:10.667
but God isn't in Oz.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.433
- Oh. Oh, yeah, he is.
He is everywhere.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.367
He is in you right now,
Tobias.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.433

19:25.834 --> 19:28.367

19:30.200 --> 19:34.467
She's gonna take the kids
and go live with her parents.

19:34.533 --> 19:39.600
If God is in me...
he's a tumor.

19:50.767 --> 19:53.000
- "Wow"?

19:55.867 --> 19:57.500
- It's "Mom".

19:57.567 --> 20:00.633

was trying to tell me

20:00.700 --> 20:02.533

an olive-colored skin.

49:44.700 --> 49:45.967
Look, I got a message here.

49:46.033 --> 49:48.100
You gotta call Maritza
right away.

49:50.533 --> 49:52.100
Father.

49:53.200 --> 49:56.800
Ever since the baby was born,

49:56.867 --> 50:00.800
you know, I-I've been bragging
to all the other guys about him.

50:00.867 --> 50:04.000
About how beautiful he is
and shit like that.

50:04.066 --> 50:05.667
I mean, you really gotta admit,
I mean,

50:05.734 --> 50:09.100
he's the most beautiful baby
in the world.

50:09.166 --> 50:13.500
So now I'm thinking
that, like,

50:13.567 --> 50:16.500
like,
maybe I went a little overboard,

50:16.567 --> 50:18.333
because Maritza called me
this morning

50:18.400 --> 50:21.000
talking about, like,
the baby got a bad liver,

50:21.066 --> 50:25.500
and-and he's still
in the hospital,

50:25.567 --> 50:28.433
and they think
that he's gonna die.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.000
So now I'm thinking

50:30.066 --> 50:33.333
that maybe God heard me
bragging so much,

50:33.400 --> 50:37.700
and he decided to...

50:37.767 --> 50:40.567
you know, punish me.

50:40.633 --> 50:43.467
- Oh, Miguel.
God doesn't work that way.

50:43.533 --> 50:44.800
- I mean, growing up, you know,

50:44.867 --> 50:46.166
I knew I was the best-looking
in my hood.

50:46.233 --> 50:47.867
You know, I told everybody,

50:47.934 --> 50:49.700
you know,
I was the best athlete.

50:49.767 --> 50:53.200
I was the best lover.
You know, even my fucking car.

50:53.266 --> 50:56.400
So now I'm thinking that,
you know, God's pissed off.

50:56.467 --> 51:02.700
I'm wondering if--
if you could talk to God for me,

51:02.767 --> 51:07.266
and-and tell him
that if he saves my baby...

51:09.100 --> 51:11.867
You know, I'll stop
being such a bigmouth.

51:11.934 --> 51:15.133
Could you do that
for me, Father?

51:17.233 --> 51:20.500
- I will, but...

51:20.567 --> 51:23.333
you got to pray to God too,
you know?

51:23.400 --> 51:25.333
Don't negotiate.

51:25.400 --> 51:27.000
You gotta stop bragging
for your own good.

51:27.066 --> 51:28.767
- I know that.

51:28.834 --> 51:31.333
But if my baby dies,

51:31.400 --> 51:36.166
you know, I-I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

51:36.233 --> 51:38.667
I mean, it-it's like I'll die.

51:38.734 --> 51:44.700
- Miguel, you should pray to God
for your son's health,

51:44.767 --> 51:47.033
but you should also ask God
to give you and Maritza

51:47.100 --> 51:49.200
the strength
to face whatever happens.

51:49.266 --> 51:51.867

that the doctor says

51:51.934 --> 51:54.200
that all this is going on
because of the drugs

51:54.266 --> 51:56.533
that we did
before she was pregnant.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.066
You know,
and after she was pregnant,

51:58.133 --> 51:59.700
you know,
people were fucking telling us,

51:59.767 --> 52:03.033
you know, not-not to, you know,
and Maritza didn't want to,

52:03.100 --> 52:04.533
you know,
and I thought nothing bad

52:04.600 --> 52:07.233
was gonna fucking happen to me.

52:10.100 --> 52:11.767
Me.

52:13.533 --> 52:15.000
Pray for me.

52:15.066 --> 52:17.767
Pray for my baby.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.734
- I will.

52:24.567 --> 52:27.500

52:27.567 --> 52:31.166
