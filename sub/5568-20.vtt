00:02.670 --> 00:06.205
¶¶

00:06.207 --> 00:09.141
<i>That's</i> what you're eating
for breakfast? Beef jerky?

00:09.143 --> 00:11.844
You've been chewing that piece
for six minutes.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.613
(electricity crackles)

00:14.615 --> 00:16.382
Eddie! What happened?!

00:16.384 --> 00:19.351
I don't know. I was just making
a Pop-Tart bagel sandwich.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.222
The Pop-Tarts were the bread,
and the bagel was the meat.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.024
Can somebody in this family

00:25.026 --> 00:26.959
just have a normal breakfast?

00:26.961 --> 00:28.727
Bite of jackfruit?

00:28.729 --> 00:31.230
No, thank you.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.999
That toaster was on its way out.
We need new one, anyway.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.367
Yes! Are we going to Sears?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.336
They have the best
men's fragrance section.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.405
No, we'll just go to the bank.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.473
They give you a free toaster
when you open a new account.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.575
But we both
already have accounts.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.577
So we'll get one of the boys
a new account.

00:45.579 --> 00:49.048
(breathes deeply)

00:51.052 --> 00:53.485
It's funny.
You never know when the moment

00:53.487 --> 00:56.255
you've been waiting for
will finally arrive.

00:56.257 --> 00:59.158
FDIC-insured, here I come.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.527
(coins clink)

01:01.529 --> 01:03.996
Okay. So, Evan, we'll open you

01:03.998 --> 01:06.265
a free-toaster checking account.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.833
Yo, where did you get
all that cash?

01:07.835 --> 01:10.202
I haven't bought candy
in three years.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.870
That's why you're my favorite.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.105
I know.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.243
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:18.245 --> 01:19.845
¶ I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go ¶

01:19.847 --> 01:21.613
¶ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ¶

01:21.615 --> 01:23.215
¶ Fresh off the boat ¶

01:23.217 --> 01:25.384
¶ Homey, you don't know
where I come from ¶

01:25.386 --> 01:26.919
¶ But I know where I'm goin' ¶

01:26.921 --> 01:29.588
¶ I'm fresh off the boat ¶

01:37.264 --> 01:40.299
(breathes deeply)
Let's do some banking.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.701
Why do we all have to be here?

01:42.703 --> 01:44.736
'Cause we're a family.
We do things together.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.905
Remember when we all went to buy
your basketball?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.874
<i>That</i> was a long day.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.443
Each one has
its own signature bounce.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.418
I'll be signing
my first official documents.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.553
I've been practicing
all morning.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.089
(slowly) Evan.

02:04.091 --> 02:07.426
It just flows.
I'm so glad it's my name.

02:07.428 --> 02:10.062
It really suits you.
It does, doesn't it?

02:10.064 --> 02:11.430
It's perfect for me.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.799
Which is good
'cause it was totally random.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.467
(chuckles softly)
What do you mean?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.402
Well, both of your brothers
had "E" names,

02:17.404 --> 02:19.638
so we knew we wanted yours
to start with "E," too.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.574
We were at the hospital, and
there it was on a name tag...

02:22.576 --> 02:23.809
Nurse Evans.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.077
What?

02:25.079 --> 02:26.512
She was the nurse
who delivered you.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.914
Uh, no, she was the nurse
who checked us out.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.582
Doesn't matter...
We know she wasn't the doctor.

02:30.584 --> 02:33.952
Hi there. I'm Frank.
How can I help you folks?

02:33.954 --> 02:37.623
We're going to be opening him
a free-toaster account.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.692
Ah, our most popular account.
Right this way.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.928
You brought along
the whole crew, huh?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.897
Apparently,
that's how we do it, Frank.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.467
So, what is the lucky
new account holder's name?

02:48.469 --> 02:50.202
His name is Nurse Evans.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.303
(laughs)

02:51.305 --> 02:53.272
My name is random?

02:53.274 --> 02:55.207
I thought you picked "Evan"
just for me.

02:55.209 --> 02:57.709
I thought you looked
into my little baby eyes

02:57.711 --> 02:59.344
and knew I was an Evan.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.180
But I could have been anything.

03:01.182 --> 03:04.383
It's not a big deal.
Names are meaningless.

03:04.385 --> 03:08.453
Did I ever tell you the story
of how I got my name?

03:08.455 --> 03:11.323
Me and my family
had just moved to the U.S.

03:11.325 --> 03:15.727
¶ Lord, I was born
a ramblin' man ¶

03:15.729 --> 03:18.063
Your parents must be so proud.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.401
Hi, sister.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.705
Nice robe.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.907
Whose name is that?

03:28.909 --> 03:34.112
I decided my American name
is going to be... Connie.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.952
Well, I'm going to keep
my Chinese name.

03:42.156 --> 03:44.990
I respect your choice.

03:47.261 --> 03:50.495
I was starting
my freshman year at Maryland.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.331
YOUNG WOMAN:
Welcome to freshman orientation.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.867
Let's go around the room, and
everyone introduce themselves.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.036
Hi, I'm Honey St. Claire.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.605
LOUIS: Wait a second.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.374
Honey, Marvin, and Deidre
didn't go to college with you.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.943
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
All white people look the same.

04:07.514 --> 04:10.048
Hello. I'm Chu Tsai Hsia.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.350
Choo Tie Sa?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.719
Chu Tsai Hsia.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.787
Choo Sigh Ta.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.690
(slowly) Chu Tsai Hsia.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.693
(slowly) Choo Tie Chi-ah?

04:21.695 --> 04:24.096
Chu... What does it mean?

04:24.098 --> 04:26.031
Colorful sunset glow.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.033
That is beautiful.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.370
Maybe we can call you "Glow,"
which everyone can pronounce.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.804
But that's not my name.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.439
Hey, a nickname's
a great idea, though.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.141
I don't want to brag,
but I'm the official

04:36.143 --> 04:37.643
nickname giver
on my lacrosse team.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.212
That's okay. I wanted...
How about, uh, Mitsy?

04:40.214 --> 04:41.913
Koko? Skags?

04:41.915 --> 04:43.482
(gasps) Moose.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.083
(laughter) Moose.

04:45.085 --> 04:46.451
Yeah, Moose, huh?

04:46.453 --> 04:48.754
That guy never stopped
giving me nicknames.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.323
Skooter, Toto, Bubba.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.659
But I wanted to keep
my Chinese name.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.328
So, how did you get
the name Jessica.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.297
Because of something
that happened

04:58.299 --> 05:00.132
in one of my business classes.

05:00.134 --> 05:03.635
So, today,
we're gonna be talking about...

05:04.738 --> 05:07.172
Butt Juice? (Laughs)

05:07.174 --> 05:10.575
Actually, it's pronounced
Butte Juice with a long "U."

05:10.577 --> 05:14.146
Named after the town it was
produced in... Butte, Montana.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.982
Looks like Butt Juice
to me. (Laughs)

05:16.984 --> 05:19.117
And you're making my point
for me.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.119
Butte Juice was almost a failure

05:21.121 --> 05:24.122
because outside Montana,
people pronounced it wrong.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.857
Luckily someone had
the foresight to change it,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.793
and they turned the company
around.

05:27.795 --> 05:31.496
Can anyone tell me
what Butte Juice became?

05:32.299 --> 05:33.598
Carol-Joan?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.368
Uh... Tab?

05:36.370 --> 05:38.036
Close.

05:38.038 --> 05:42.474
Butte Juice became the fruit
drink sensation known as...

05:42.476 --> 05:44.609
Geyser Mist. Huh.

05:44.611 --> 05:48.180
And what business principle
does this illustrate?

05:50.184 --> 05:51.850
Honey?

05:51.852 --> 05:55.120
(gasps) Are we in? Did we start?

05:55.122 --> 05:57.522
That's right... branding.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.891
Now, branding
is a key component...

05:59.893 --> 06:02.661
Excuse me? Professor Roberts?

06:02.663 --> 06:04.830
Why do you never call on me?

06:04.832 --> 06:07.632
Well, it's a big class.
I probably just didn't see you.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.334
I sit in the front.

06:09.336 --> 06:12.170
Today you called on sleepy Honey
all the way in the back.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.173
(snores)

06:15.175 --> 06:18.977
Okay, the truth is,
I can't pronounce your name.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.812
You can learn
how to pronounce it.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.316
Are you really gonna have this
conversation with everyone you meet?

06:24.318 --> 06:26.251
With everyone
who reads your résumé?

06:26.253 --> 06:28.820
It's my name. People
should learn how to say it.

06:28.822 --> 06:32.724
Yes, but they probably won't.
It's like Butte Juice.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.326
It was always delicious,

06:34.328 --> 06:36.995
but people didn't know that
till it became Geyser Mist.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.164
It was the same drink.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.099
It just went
by a different name.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.368
That's what made it successful.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.204
That is so funny.
I don't know about you guys,

06:46.206 --> 06:49.174
but I'd drink the heck out
of some Butt Juice.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.842
(laughs) (scoffs)

06:50.844 --> 06:53.845
That professor was a jerk,
but he had a point.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.547
Why was I being stubborn

06:55.549 --> 06:59.050
and making it harder than it
already was in a new country?

06:59.052 --> 07:01.853
I wasn't losing my identity.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.856
I still had my Chinese name,
but by giving myself

07:04.858 --> 07:07.626
a name that was easier
for people pronounce,

07:07.628 --> 07:10.362
I was opening the door
to more opportunity.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.797
ROBERTS: So, can anyone tell me

07:11.799 --> 07:14.032
the benefit for
above-competition pricing

07:14.034 --> 07:17.235
for a product looking
to break into the marketplace?

07:17.237 --> 07:19.104
Yes? Bob?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.605
"Bob"?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.707
It was my favorite haircut.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.610
I didn't realize it was also
the most popular male name.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.279
I changed it after a week.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.748
You still haven't told us
how you got the name Jessica.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.317
Oh, from the Allman Brothers
song "Jessica."

07:32.319 --> 07:35.086
You know I love
country jam-rock instrumentals.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.757
Uh, Jessica, I think if you
were trying to convince Evan

07:38.759 --> 07:40.325
that names aren't a big deal,

07:40.327 --> 07:42.427
that<i> maybe</i> wasn't
the best story.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.762
No, it wasn't.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.831
Deciding what name to sign

07:45.833 --> 07:48.400
is even more important
than I thought.

07:48.402 --> 07:51.236
I mean, should I use
my Chinese name, Chih Fu?

07:51.238 --> 07:52.337
Shoo Foo?

07:52.339 --> 07:54.473
Chih Fu. Seafood?

07:54.475 --> 07:57.742
<i>Yes,</i> Frank, that's my name...
Seafood.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.578
We don't have time for this.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.848
My name is about to be
officially entered into record.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.983
Do I use my American nurse name

08:04.985 --> 08:08.420
or my Chinese name that
will cause me endless struggle?

08:08.422 --> 08:09.721
GRANDMA HUANG: Hey!

08:13.927 --> 08:15.760
Do you know her?

08:15.762 --> 08:16.762
No.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.768
O-kay.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.438
I'm just gonna leave this form
here while you decide

08:26.440 --> 08:29.674
what name you want to open
the account under.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.376
"Sure, Lauren,
I'll take your shift.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.612
Nothing much happens at the bank
on a Saturday."

08:33.614 --> 08:35.447
I only practiced signing
Evan Huang,

08:35.449 --> 08:36.781
so maybe I stick with that.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.284
Or do I go with Chih Fu Huang?

08:39.286 --> 08:41.386
But cursive F's are so hard.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.522
Dude, we're just trying to get
a toaster.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.991
So they picked the name Evan
at random? So what?

08:45.993 --> 08:48.326
Eddie and Emery's names
were just as random.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.895
It's true.
I thought of Emery's name

08:49.897 --> 08:51.830
while I was filing my nails
on an emery board.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.332
I have chills.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.368
And Eddie was named after
the child villain

08:56.370 --> 08:58.203
in "The Lion, the Witch
and the Wardrobe,"

08:58.205 --> 09:00.505
who betrayed his siblings
for some Turkish delight.

09:00.507 --> 09:04.009
I don't know what Turkish
delight is, but I'd do it again.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.244
They're not the ones
about to sign their name

09:06.246 --> 09:09.147
to their first official document
for all of time.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.917
You want to know how unimportant
and random the name Louis is?

09:11.919 --> 09:15.687
Basically, I loved Lou Ferrigno
and the Incredible Hulk.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.689
(growling on TV)

09:17.691 --> 09:20.091
(explosion)

09:20.093 --> 09:21.393
Stay angry, Lou!

09:21.395 --> 09:24.162
(growling)

09:24.164 --> 09:26.765
Lou, Louis. Simple as that.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.035
Okay, yeah. That does make me
feel a little better.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.203
But wait. You hate
the Incredible Hulk.

09:32.205 --> 09:33.705
No, I don't. Yeah, you do.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.740
Remember? I was trying to buy
that comic book,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.709
and you said
he was the worst superhero ever

09:37.711 --> 09:39.210
because all he does is get mad.

09:39.212 --> 09:41.413
You said,
"That's not superpower.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.014
That's a character flaw."

09:43.016 --> 09:46.217
Eddie, I'm just trying to make
your brother feel better

09:46.219 --> 09:49.020
with a simple story
of how I got my name.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.590
Wait.
Is that not the real story?

09:51.592 --> 09:53.925
(sighs) No.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.561
The real story
is more complicated.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.463
It was 1981.

09:58.465 --> 10:01.633
I just arrived in the States, and I
didn't know how anything worked.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.603
I answered a roommate ad, which
is how I met your uncle Barry,

10:04.605 --> 10:06.471
who got me a job
as a busboy in a diner.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.973
Hey, Hong. It's Huang.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.741
Hong, Huang, it don't matter.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.543
It is important to make clear

10:11.545 --> 10:13.745
that Barry is
no one in this family's uncle.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.046
He's a bum.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.615
Continue.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.617
I'm gonna give you some
of Barry's secrets of the trade.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.952
When I walk around
and I see French fries

10:20.954 --> 10:23.788
uneaten and untouched,
I put them in a little baggie

10:23.790 --> 10:25.457
and put them back in my bin.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.159
When I get home, I put them
on a plate with my regular food.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.562
Mm! (Laughs) Smart. (Chuckles)

10:30.564 --> 10:33.632
Hey, uh, Barry? Who's that guy?

10:33.634 --> 10:37.469
¶¶

10:37.471 --> 10:39.738
He looks like a gangster.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.339
He's a gangster, all right.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.341
That's Louis.
He owns the aquarium.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.610
He's what we call a fish boss.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.278
Fish boss?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.580
Bloop, bloop, bloop.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.181
Bloop, bloop, bloop. (Chuckles)

10:50.183 --> 10:51.449
Yeah.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.984
What is that... Bloop, bloop?

10:52.986 --> 10:55.854
Oh, that's the bubbles coming...

10:55.856 --> 10:58.657
Fish, water. I-I get it, I get it.
I get it.

10:58.659 --> 11:02.160
He looks like
he has it all figured out.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.629
He hasn't figured out
how refill his own water.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.664
Go get him.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.332
(clears throat)

11:07.334 --> 11:09.234
(clears throat)

11:11.204 --> 11:14.139
Uh, more water?
(chuckles awkwardly)

11:14.141 --> 11:18.677
Water? Water?!
I got plenty of water, kid.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.378
I traffic in water.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.016
But, yeah, I'll take some water.

11:29.890 --> 11:33.191
That guy had it together.
He even ordered cool.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.293
"Patty melt... Real cheesy."

11:35.295 --> 11:36.695
Onions or no onions?

11:36.697 --> 11:37.796
Extra onions.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.997
(whistles)

11:38.999 --> 11:40.331
Emery gets it.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.467
So, I borrowed his style.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.670
Changing my look gave me
confidence and swagger.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.840
It made me feel
like I was gonna be okay here.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.376
BARRY: How great is this?

11:51.378 --> 11:54.379
All you-can-eat seafood medley
for $4.99.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.849
(chuckles) I'm never leaving.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.585
Does you food
have a metallic aftertaste?

12:00.587 --> 12:04.022
I don't know. I'm eating
so fast, I can't taste it.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.658
Would guys like some more water?

12:08.028 --> 12:10.462
(as Cool Louis)
I got plenty of water, kid.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.068
Oh, my gosh. I don't what I'm
gonna do with myself here.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.069
I'm in heaven.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.838
(stomach gurgles) Ugh.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.407
This octopus po' boy
is not sitting well.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.110
I'll be back.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.613
LOUIS: Apparently, the medley had
taken down half the restaurant,

12:28.615 --> 12:31.382
and they only had
one unisex bathroom.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.218
I was finally on deck

12:33.220 --> 12:36.087
when I saw the prettiest girl
I'd ever seen.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.889
(gags)

12:37.891 --> 12:41.760
Uh, you, uh, eat
the po' boy, too?

12:41.762 --> 12:44.429
(inhales sharply)
And some shrimpy nuggets.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.897
Ohh...

12:45.899 --> 12:50.235
(clears throat)
You, uh, like nuggets, woman?

12:50.237 --> 12:51.870
I know a great nugget spot...

12:51.872 --> 12:52.971
Can I cut in front of you?

12:52.973 --> 12:56.541
Ooh, that's a big ask.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.878
Here's an even bigger one.
(exhales sharply)

12:59.880 --> 13:03.548
You, me, nuggets, Saturday.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.583
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.619
I don't like nuggets.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.788
That's fine.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.157
Never nuggets or no nuggets now?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.460
I'll give you my number.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.229
On the way out. Okay.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.231
I'll be here.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.300
(sighs) What's your name?

13:25.672 --> 13:27.238
Louis.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.910
I'm Jessica.

13:31.912 --> 13:32.977
Oh...

13:34.948 --> 13:36.815
Jessica...

13:36.817 --> 13:39.617
Isn't it amazing?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.586
That restaurant is<i> still</i> open.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.087
Shocking.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.790
Anyway, that was the first time
I ever used my name.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.792
And now that your mom knew me
as Louis,

13:47.794 --> 13:50.061
I didn't want to be known
as anything else.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.299
Sounds like the opposite
of unimportant and random

13:54.301 --> 13:55.500
to me, Louis.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.308
Was that it?

14:03.310 --> 14:05.610
You never saw
the aquarium gangster again?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.245
Oh, I saw him again.

14:08.782 --> 14:10.448
I ate the shells.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.218
COOL LOUIS: What?!

14:13.220 --> 14:16.154
You're the busboy
from the diner.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.822
You copied my look.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.057
No, I didn't.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.391
What's your name?

14:20.393 --> 14:23.561
My name? Oh.
(chuckles awkwardly) Louis.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.464
That's my name. There's only
room for one Louis around here.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.166
Look, I'm sorry,

14:28.168 --> 14:31.202
but I just told a beautiful
woman with food poisoning

14:31.204 --> 14:32.637
that Louis is my name,

14:32.639 --> 14:34.672
and I'm not gonna have her think
I'm a liar.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.574
(sighs)

14:36.576 --> 14:39.177
¶¶

14:39.179 --> 14:40.678
Oh.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.747
Uh... Barry?

14:42.749 --> 14:45.083
Uh, Barry?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.485
Barry.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.824
LOUIS: So we decided to fight
for the name.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.425
¶¶

14:58.565 --> 15:04.936
(retches, vomits)

15:04.938 --> 15:06.371
(coughing)

15:06.373 --> 15:09.874
Damn, bro!
What are those? Tentacles?

15:09.876 --> 15:11.542
Guess I didn't get
all the octopus out.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.946
That's disgusting.
And I work at an aquarium.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.781
Well, I work in...

15:16.783 --> 15:19.050
(retches, vomits)

15:19.052 --> 15:20.852
Ugh! Ugh.

15:20.854 --> 15:24.088
Take the name. You can have it.
I don't want it.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.557
(coughs) Nasty.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.928
(chuckles)

15:29.930 --> 15:32.363
(retches, vomits)

15:32.365 --> 15:34.565
You've always been
an intense vomiter.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.368
Remember that time you ate
that entire gingerbread house?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.871
Those gumdrops came out
like bullets.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.873
Okay.
You decide who you are yet?

15:41.875 --> 15:45.410
No. Mom chose the name Jessica,
and it changed her life.

15:45.412 --> 15:48.413
Dad chose the name Louis,
and it changed his life.

15:48.415 --> 15:52.317
What I choose today
could change my life.

15:52.319 --> 15:55.486
What if I told you
there was a<i> third</i> option?

15:55.488 --> 15:57.322
Is the third option

15:57.324 --> 15:59.684
going to a store
and just buying a toaster?

16:06.900 --> 16:09.400
So, what's the third option?

16:09.402 --> 16:12.337
Little bro, you can have
the name your parents give you,

16:12.339 --> 16:14.272
the name the culture gives you,

16:14.274 --> 16:16.307
or the name
the streets give you.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.742
Meadowridge Lane?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.744
No, not the name <i>of</i> your street.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.245
Your name<i> from</i> the streets.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.148
Calvin Broadus
became Snoop Dogg.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.951
O'Shea Jackson became Ice Cube.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.393
Reginald Dwight
became Elton John.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.091
(sighs)

16:33.093 --> 16:35.626
That's what I'm gonna do.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.795
When I take over
multiple industries

16:37.797 --> 16:39.364
and become a business mogul,

16:39.366 --> 16:42.433
I'm gonna earn myself
a dope-ass name.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.635
¶¶

16:44.637 --> 16:46.337
¶ D-I-C-K is my name ¶

16:46.339 --> 16:47.672
¶ I spell things to the... ¶

16:47.674 --> 16:50.041
There is no world,
real or imaginary,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.610
where you will ever have
a face tattoo.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.447
¶ We gots to show ¶

16:56.449 --> 16:59.283
(funk music playing)

17:01.654 --> 17:03.974
Topaz, your Pop-Tagel is ready.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.557
The bagel is the meat.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.093
Also, the President
is on the line for you.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.065
'Sup, President Shaq?

17:14.067 --> 17:16.634
Topaz, I'm calling to thank you.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.403
When you promised me
Army uniforms

17:18.405 --> 17:20.505
that not only could
the soldiers fight in

17:20.507 --> 17:22.340
but also dance in,
I was skeptical,

17:22.342 --> 17:24.142
but you delivered.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.512
Got the idea when I dropped
my G.I. Joe into some crayons.

17:27.514 --> 17:31.382
¶¶

17:31.384 --> 17:32.917
We still on for golf Wednesday?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.986
You know it. Is
Vice President Barkley coming?

17:34.988 --> 17:36.988
Of course...
Somebody got to carry the bags.

17:36.990 --> 17:41.392
Ohhhh! Ohhhh!

17:41.394 --> 17:44.062
Sorry about the interruption.
What were you saying again?

17:44.064 --> 17:47.331
I said I really
wasn't feeling too good

17:47.333 --> 17:50.001
about this concert that you want
me to do for you on the moon.

17:50.003 --> 17:52.370
They ain't got no air
up there, bro.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.905
Listen to me, Busta Rhymes.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.374
People expect greatness
from Topaz Industries.

17:56.376 --> 18:00.878
That's what my name means, and
that's what I expect from you.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.448
When my father died after
swallowing all those buttons,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.883
I didn't take over his
steakhouse and turn it into

18:05.885 --> 18:10.054
the number-one hip-hop label/
clothing line/multimedia empire

18:10.056 --> 18:12.123
to play it safe.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.127
They ain't got
no air up there! None!

18:16.129 --> 18:17.895
How I'm supposed to rap
with a helmet on?

18:17.897 --> 18:19.697
Where all this dread gonna go?

18:19.699 --> 18:22.219
I'll design the helmet.
You just write the songs.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.535
Okay.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.742
Topaz? Really?

18:31.744 --> 18:33.244
It's my birthstone, dawg.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.313
It's the<i> worst</i> stone.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.447
It really is.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.916
I died from swallowing buttons?

18:38.918 --> 18:41.085
None of your stories
have been any help,

18:41.087 --> 18:43.254
especially not yours, Topaz.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.922
Hey, I don't care
what y'all say...

18:44.924 --> 18:46.924
That name is hella cool.

18:46.926 --> 18:51.062
I need to go splash some water
on my face, clear my head.

18:51.064 --> 18:53.664
"Moon Rock Festival."

18:53.666 --> 18:55.166
What?

18:55.168 --> 18:57.735
You could call it
the Moon Rock Festival...

18:57.737 --> 18:59.837
If you have a concert
on the moon.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.973
Hmm.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.008
(door opens)

19:04.010 --> 19:06.711
Oh, sorry. The door wasn't...

19:08.915 --> 19:11.883
You probably think
I should use my Chinese name.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.589
Let me guess...
You have a long, unhelpful story

19:18.591 --> 19:20.191
about how you chose your name.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.067
So, what do you think
I should do?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.212
What do you mean?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.493
(speaks Chinese)

19:55.495 --> 19:57.128
Thanks, Grandma.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.998
Yeah, so, our insurance
actually isn't too bad here.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You know, they cover
six doctor's visits a year,

20:03.002 --> 20:05.503
plus the colonoscopy that
I was supposed to have today

20:05.505 --> 20:07.004
and had to reschedule,
even though I drank

20:07.006 --> 20:09.507
all that magnesium.
- I've made my decision.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.575
- Oh.
- Finally.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.143
- Thank God.
- I'm dying!

20:12.145 --> 20:13.344
EMERY: Congrats.

20:13.346 --> 20:15.313
Mnh-mnh.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.714
(sighs)

20:16.716 --> 20:21.385
¶¶

20:21.387 --> 20:24.155
Look at it... even the temporary
checks are beautiful.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.157
(clatter)

20:27.493 --> 20:30.161
I definitely saw that coming.
Me too.

20:30.163 --> 20:32.830
Here, Mom.
Use this to buy a new one.

20:32.832 --> 20:36.100
It's my treat.
I wrote "Toast" in the memo.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.037
After all that, you can't even
tell what name he chose.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.006
His signature's illegible.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.841
It's the signature of a doctor.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.843
Doesn't matter
what name he chose.

20:45.845 --> 20:49.614
Everyone will call him
Dr. Huang.

20:56.689 --> 21:00.024
(laughing)

21:00.026 --> 21:02.193
(sighs)

21:08.034 --> 21:10.701
And what name would you like to
put your library card under?

21:10.703 --> 21:12.803
Jenny. Mm.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.874
Perfect. That's all I need.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.710
Welcome to the D.C.
Public Library system, Jenny.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.993
I'll see you back in five days
when the books are due.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.619
Okay.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.055
Have a great day. Bye, Jenny.
