00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
<i>Now, you see,</i>

00:46.960 --> 00:49.554
<i>this is what we could be
doing on a holiday.</i>

00:50.560 --> 00:53.950
<i>Not all the hiking-up-mountains stuff
you're planning.</i>

00:54.240 --> 00:56.470
Tickles. Tickles.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.278
You want me to stop?

00:59.440 --> 01:00.589
No.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.193
But it's 6:15.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.998
- 6:15?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.153
Oh, I gotta go.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.314
I'll cook tonight.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.998
<i>Don't even think about it.</i>

01:36.200 --> 01:37.519
<i>It's pouring.</i>

01:47.040 --> 01:48.837
- Freddie! Ooh, whoa!
- Watch it!

01:49.040 --> 01:50.314
Yeah, listen, I'm on it.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.198
All right, the West Coast
will still be up.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.432
I'll call Carmichael now
and we can close this.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.199
Taxi!

01:59.720 --> 02:01.278
Yeah, we won't. Don't worry.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.760
Look out!

02:32.920 --> 02:34.069
<i>Bye now!</i>

02:34.240 --> 02:36.231
<i>Take care, John!</i>

02:39.080 --> 02:41.435
<i>Um... How many in this one?</i>

02:41.640 --> 02:43.232
170 calories.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.470
You did have that one yesterday.

02:46.360 --> 02:47.634
What about that one, then?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.074
220.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.593
But it is less
if you eat them standing up.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.434
- Oh!
- Yeah. Should we put them in a bag?

02:55.600 --> 02:58.751
- Please. Come on.
- Yeah! Thanks, Frank.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.954
I don't think I can finish this.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.792
Shall we wrap it up for you, Daphne?

03:12.000 --> 03:13.911
Have it later? Yeah.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.439
I'm really sorry.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.280
<i>A month's money.
That's big of him.</i>

04:07.440 --> 04:09.237
<i>Given she's worked
like a Trojan in that café</i>

04:09.400 --> 04:10.674
for the past six years.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.671
He's closing down, love. He had no choice.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.273
What the hell is she gonna do now?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.416
Treena can't get any more
hours in the flower shop.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.635
Lou will get another job.
She has a lot of potential.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.679
There are no jobs, Josie. I should know.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.637
Look, I'm just saying,

04:25.520 --> 04:27.351
we needed that money.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.272
Let's not panic, eh?

04:29.440 --> 04:31.590
She'll find something. Won't you, Lou?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.317
That's it, Callum! Go on!

04:36.520 --> 04:37.794
<i>Run with me, babe!</i>

04:39.040 --> 04:40.837
- Come on!
- Nah. Uh-uh.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.116
- Only got two laps to go.
- Oh, God!

04:45.120 --> 04:46.678
You just gotta get back out there.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.876
Think what you wanna do.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.336
- Estate agent, maybe.
- Ooh! Yeah.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.873
Shop assistant. Catering.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.598
Do we have to discuss this again?

04:53.760 --> 04:55.478
Well, you can't just mope around.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.720
All the best entrepreneurs,

04:56.800 --> 04:58.480
they fight their way back
from rock-bottom.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.560
Just look at me, eh!

04:59.720 --> 05:01.199
Oh! But I'm not you, Pat.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.231
I toast tea cakes.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.958
Look, can't you slow down?

05:05.120 --> 05:06.917
I'm wearing the wrong bra.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.594
I'm just saying,

05:12.760 --> 05:15.149
put on a smile, and head back
to the job center.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.072
Don't worry about the holiday.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.639
I'll pay.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.035
So the last two weeks,

05:26.200 --> 05:27.997
we've tried the chicken
processing factory...

05:28.160 --> 05:29.816
I'm still having nightmares
about those giblets.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.216
- We've tried beautician.
- Turns out

05:31.240 --> 05:32.309
hot wax is not my friend.

05:32.480 --> 05:34.550
I'm running out of options
for you here, Louisa.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.790
Syed, please! I'll take anything.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh!

05:40.200 --> 05:41.713
This is new in.

05:41.880 --> 05:43.916
It's not far from your home.

05:44.080 --> 05:47.436
But you might need to do something
about your wardrobe for this one.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
Hmm?

05:48.760 --> 05:51.433
Care and companionship for a disabled man.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.760
What kind of care?

05:52.920 --> 05:55.115
Needs someone to drive, feed and assist.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.748
Six-month, fixed-term contract.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.429
Oh! And it's good money.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.238
It's actually excellent money.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.073
It's the fifth time
they've tried to recruit.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.878
They're desperate.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.112
There's nothing on here
about needing skills.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.349
It's perfect for you.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.714
Yeah?

06:13.360 --> 06:15.078
I know it's not how you like to dress.

06:15.240 --> 06:17.276
Is it how anyone likes to dress?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.118
- It served me very well.
- Oh!

06:19.280 --> 06:21.236
In 1983!

06:21.440 --> 06:23.112
Styles change, love,

06:23.320 --> 06:26.357
- but smart remains smart.
- Uh-huh.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.157
- Thank you.
- Bye, love.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.397
Oh!

07:03.760 --> 07:05.478
- You must be Louisa Clark.
- Yeah.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.995
I'm Camilla Traynor. Do come in.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.353
Please, sit down.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.635
Oh, okay.

07:26.640 --> 07:29.473
Do you have any experience of caregiving?

07:29.640 --> 07:31.640
Um, I've never done it,
but I'm sure I could learn.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.560
Do you have any experience
with quadriplegia?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.358
Er, no.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.276
We are talking about complete
loss of the legs,

07:38.440 --> 07:40.510
and very limited use
of the arms and the hands.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.680
Would that bother you?

07:41.840 --> 07:44.035
Not as much as it would
bother him. Obviously.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
Sorry.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.719
Sorry. No, I didn't... No, uh...

07:46.880 --> 07:48.029
No, I...

07:50.560 --> 07:52.596
- Are you all right?
- Um, I'm...

07:52.840 --> 07:53.840
I'm just a little hot.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.036
Do you mind if I take off my jacket?

07:59.240 --> 08:01.549
<i>Your previous employer, here, says</i>

08:01.720 --> 08:05.235
you are a warm, chatty
and life-enhancing presence

08:05.400 --> 08:06.674
with a lot of potential.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.359
Yes, I paid him.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.556
So, what exactly do you
want to do with your life?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.034
Sorry?

08:14.200 --> 08:16.794
Do you have aspirations for a career,

08:16.960 --> 08:19.633
or a professional dream
that you wish to pursue?

08:19.800 --> 08:20.915
- Um, well...
- Miss Clark,

08:21.080 --> 08:24.914
why should I employ you
instead of, say, the previous candidate?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Um...

08:28.040 --> 08:31.077
Really, you can't think of a single reason
why I should employ you?

08:31.280 --> 08:33.635
Well, no. Yes, Mrs. Traynor.
I'm...

08:33.799 --> 08:35.597
I'm a fast learner.

08:35.760 --> 08:36.794
And I'm never ill.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.428
And I only live on
the other side of the castle.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.909
And I'm stronger than I look.
And I just...

08:42.120 --> 08:43.758
I make a mean cup of tea.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.696
You know, there really isn't
much that can't be solved

08:45.720 --> 08:47.551
by a decent cup of tea.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.235
Not that I'm saying that your husband's
paraplegia... Quadriplegia

08:51.400 --> 08:52.760
- can be solved by...
- My husband?

08:53.840 --> 08:55.159
It's my son.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.954
Your son.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.793
Will was injured in
a road accident two years ago.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.109
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:03.280 --> 09:06.477
When I'm nervous, I just say stupid stuff.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.517
<i>I'm just popping out.</i>

09:08.680 --> 09:10.716
Oh, another interviewee.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.800
Will you be back this evening?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.428
I'll do my best. Why?
Do you need me for something?

09:15.600 --> 09:16.919
No, darling. Fine.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.278
Hello. I'm Stephen. Will's father.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.471
Louisa Clark.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.119
Nice to meet you.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.032
Lovely to meet you.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.993
- See you later, darling.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.678
So.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.474
Hmm.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.239
Would you like the job?

09:45.840 --> 09:46.840
Yes!

09:47.000 --> 09:48.149
Can you start immediately?

09:48.320 --> 09:49.469
Yes!

09:49.640 --> 09:50.640
Good.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.030
Then let's go and meet Will.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.475
Right, yeah. Okay. Um, sure.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.074
The hours are 8:00 to 5:00,
Monday to Saturday.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.315
If, for whatever reason,

09:59.480 --> 10:01.357
you're running late
or you need to leave early,

10:01.520 --> 10:03.317
- please call and let me know.
- Okay.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.198
I must stress

10:05.360 --> 10:08.955
that Will should not be left alone
for longer than 15 minutes.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.194
And, uh...

10:11.920 --> 10:14.309
You might want to wear something
a little less revealing.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.712
Oh, yes, of course.

10:19.880 --> 10:20.915
This is the annex.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.992
It was the stables before
we had it adapted for Will.

10:26.040 --> 10:30.192
Um, I'll give you a set of car keys,
and put you on the insurance.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.440
Nathan will show you how to use the ramp.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.917
There's a bathroom in here.

10:38.360 --> 10:42.672
<i>Tea and coffee are in this cupboard here.</i>

10:43.360 --> 10:44.759
You're welcome to help yourself.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.596
And there is always food in the fridge.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.388
You and Will can work out
your level of interaction yourselves.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.039
Um, obviously...

10:54.200 --> 10:56.509
Well, I would hope that you could get on.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.760
It would be nice if he could
think of you as a friend

10:58.880 --> 11:00.711
rather than a paid professional.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.632
Do you have any questions?

11:02.800 --> 11:03.800
No.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.256
Then let's introduce you to Will.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.400
He should be dressed by now.

11:10.240 --> 11:12.754
He has good days and bad days.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.593
Mrs. Traynor, I won't let you down.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.755
Good.

11:18.280 --> 11:20.475
I have someone to meet you.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.676
<i>Yeah, he's decent, Mrs. T.</i>

11:23.760 --> 11:26.354
Will, this is Louisa Clark.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.429
I'm Lou!

11:36.880 --> 11:38.336
<i>Will.</i>

11:38.360 --> 11:39.429
William.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.119
William, please.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.993
Hello, Louisa Clark. I'm Will Traynor.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.711
You appear to have a problem
with your skirt.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.677
You're a bad man, Mr. T.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.273
G'day. I'm Nathan.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.155
<i>Right.</i>

12:04.320 --> 12:05.560
Well, I'll leave you to get on.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.275
Miss Clark, Nathan will talk you
through Will's routines and equipment.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.476
You don't have to talk across me, Mother.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.471
My brain isn't paralyzed.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.360
Yet.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.155
I'm Lou!

12:33.640 --> 12:35.870
Yeah. You already said that.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.757
Shall I make us all a cup of tea?

12:41.120 --> 12:42.678
Wrench! Where's my wrench?

12:42.840 --> 12:44.831
Mum, did you turn down the gas on my veg?

12:45.000 --> 12:46.400
That's the cutlery drawer, Bernard.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.656
And you're getting oil everywhere.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.816
Everything will be soggy again.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.400
Yeah, well, things turn up in
strange places in this house.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.869
- Auntie Lou! Auntie Lou!
- Oh!

12:55.840 --> 12:58.195
- You got it, didn't you?
- Uh...

12:58.760 --> 12:59.829
Yeah!

13:03.880 --> 13:04.880
Yay!

13:05.040 --> 13:07.190
Louisa Clark, working for the Traynors.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.839
Wonders will never cease.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.040
Uh, yeah.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.029
<i>Okay.</i>

13:19.880 --> 13:23.429
This tells you pretty much
everything you need to know.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.556
Now, I do most of the heavy lifting,

13:25.720 --> 13:29.508
but there's a timetable here
so you can see what he has, when.

13:31.280 --> 13:32.713
I have to handle drugs?

13:32.880 --> 13:36.395
Blood-pressure meds to raise it
in the morning when he gets up.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.913
Anti-spasm tablets.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.514
Four times a day
to control muscular spasms.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.557
Tablets for nerve pain.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.757
Um, now, you can give him
painkillers, if he asks.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.559
Just try to resist giving him
sleeping pills, if possible.

13:48.760 --> 13:52.196
They tend to make him
a little bit, um, you know, irritable.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.193
No, uh... More irritable.

13:57.600 --> 13:58.715
It's a lot to remember.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.279
Well, it's all written down.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.754
You know, he knows what's what.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.433
Though, he might deny it.

14:03.600 --> 14:04.749
And you got my number.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.280
Most of my other patients are nearby,
so I'm never far away.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.550
What if he needs to... Uh...

14:09.720 --> 14:10.755
No, don't worry.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.797
You're not here for
any of the physical stuff.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.399
What am I here for?

14:17.400 --> 14:18.799
To cheer him up, I guess.

14:33.480 --> 14:34.480
Hello.

14:35.600 --> 14:36.999
Hello.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.256
So I thought we could
go out this afternoon.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.560
Where do you have in mind?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.520
Well, I was told that you had a car
that was adapted for wheelchair use.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.074
And you thought a drive
would be good for me.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.748
A breath of fresh air.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.114
What do you usually do?

14:50.320 --> 14:51.600
I don't do anything, Miss Clark.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.791
I sit. I just about exist.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.155
Okay. Well, I could get you your computer.

14:57.320 --> 14:59.993
Have you found a good quad
support group I could join?

15:00.160 --> 15:01.639
Quads "R" Us?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.631
The Tin Wheels Club?

15:04.840 --> 15:07.832
Or perhaps we could
get to know each other a bit.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.073
You know, because then you could tell me
what you do like to do.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.679
May...

15:14.840 --> 15:16.034
Maybe.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.035
Here's what I know about you, Miss Clark.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.679
My mother says you're chatty.

15:27.840 --> 15:28.875
Yeah.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.155
Can we strike a deal?

15:30.360 --> 15:34.717
Whereby you are very un-chatty around me?

15:41.880 --> 15:43.029
Okay.

15:45.560 --> 15:49.109
Yeah, well, I'll just be in the kitchen
if, you know, need anything.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.034
Lovely.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.990
<i>So, how was he?</i>

16:26.520 --> 16:29.671
He done his Stephen Hawking impression yet
or just stuck with <i>My Left Foot?</i>

16:30.080 --> 16:31.080
Ah, he's fine!

16:31.240 --> 16:33.435
Okay. Well, you can take lunch now.

16:33.600 --> 16:37.036
Me and Mr. T. have a few things
to take care of at this time of day.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.113
Good morning!

17:13.960 --> 17:15.313
Hi!

17:19.440 --> 17:20.440
Not a great day.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.959
Would you like a cup of tea?

17:33.040 --> 17:34.234
Sorry.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.749
<i>Val d'Isère.</i>

17:41.960 --> 17:43.473
Good snow that year.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.914
Sorry. I was... I was...

17:45.120 --> 17:47.680
You were just looking at my photographs,

17:47.840 --> 17:50.195
thinking how awful it must be
to have lived like that

17:50.360 --> 17:51.679
and ended up like this.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.720
The rest are in the drawer
if you'd like to snoop around further.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.839
Good morning.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.954
Every time I speak,
he looks at me like I'm stupid.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.151
To be fair, you are pretty stupid.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.880
Yeah, but he doesn't know that yet.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.352
Maybe he's like that with everyone

18:27.520 --> 18:29.376
until he knows whether
they're gonna stick around.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.680
I mean, it's only been 10 days.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.029
Feels like a lifetime.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.553
Well, you can't quit, Lou.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.870
Yeah? Watch me.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.080
Um...

18:42.240 --> 18:45.073
Look, I'm thinking of
going back to college.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.896
Someone's dropped out of business studies
and they can take me back.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.353
What? What about Thomas?

18:49.560 --> 18:52.757
There's a nursery on campus.
We'd come back at weekends.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.136
<i>I don't have a Patrick, Lou.</i>

18:55.160 --> 18:57.674
I don't think I'm ever gonna
have a Patrick.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.034
<i>I need this.</i>

18:59.240 --> 19:00.434
Oh, I get it.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.875
You just need me to stay here
in my miserable job,

19:03.040 --> 19:04.268
so I can help Mum and Dad.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.556
- I've done my fair share.
- Yeah?

19:07.640 --> 19:10.632
I can't stay here.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.870
<i>You know I can't.</i>

19:13.040 --> 19:15.873
Please, for me and Tom.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.719
Louisa, some visitors are on their way.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.074
Friends of Will's. It's unexpected.

19:40.600 --> 19:41.635
You might need to...

19:41.800 --> 19:43.518
Oh, I'll make some tea or coffee.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.477
And I'll make myself scarce.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.751
Yes, that would be good.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.918
I think I'll...

19:52.320 --> 19:54.231
I think I'll leave them to it.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.280
So how's the physio and stuff?

20:03.440 --> 20:05.670
<i>All coming on? Any improvements?</i>

20:05.840 --> 20:07.159
No.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.069
Well, you look great.

20:09.240 --> 20:10.639
- Yeah.
- So...

20:13.160 --> 20:14.309
So.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.431
To what do I owe this pleasure?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.616
I'm sorry it's been so long.
I've been so busy.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.696
They've been really working me hard.
I mean, weekends.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.517
Yeah, things are manic at the office, too.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.874
New chap from New York.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.296
Bains! You ever come across him at all?

20:26.320 --> 20:27.435
No.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.795
Fearsome. Total monster!

20:29.960 --> 20:32.394
Most days I feel I can
hardly leave my chair.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.197
<i>Please say something.</i>

20:52.200 --> 20:54.270
Congratulations.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.152
Neither of us meant for this to happen.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.356
We were just friends for ages.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.635
And if truth be told,

20:59.800 --> 21:02.040
Rupert was the most terrific
support after your accident.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.309
Big of him.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.708
Oh, Will, please. I...

21:06.600 --> 21:08.636
We should probably go.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.029
I'm sorry, Will. I really am.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.200
We both are.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.591
And I... We really do hope
things improve for you.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.480
Thank you.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.278
You know, I tried for months.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.160
He just pushed me away.
Didn't want me here.

21:47.840 --> 21:51.719
You can only help someone
who actually wants to be helped.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.959
I was wondering if you wanted me to...

22:20.440 --> 22:23.056
Right, well, you better not move
until I've cleaned that up because

22:23.080 --> 22:26.038
I've got no idea what I'd do
if you pop a tire.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.472
It was awful!

22:34.640 --> 22:38.349
It's his girlfriend and his best friend.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.078
You can't blame her.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.776
Are you really saying that
you'd stick around with me

22:41.800 --> 22:43.176
if I was paralyzed from the neck down?

22:43.200 --> 22:45.111
Of course I would.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.397
Well, I wouldn't want someone
staying with me out of pity.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.994
I mean, strangers wipe your arse. Jesus!

22:51.160 --> 22:52.880
And think of all the things
you couldn't do.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.793
No more running, no more cycling.

22:55.960 --> 22:56.995
No more sex.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.776
Of course, you could have sex.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.756
It's just the girl would
have to be on top.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.150
- Oh, well, we'd be doomed, then.
- Mmm.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.632
- Hey, listen.
- Yeah.

23:05.800 --> 23:07.711
- About the holiday.
- Yeah.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.474
How do you fancy...

23:10.760 --> 23:11.760
Norway?

23:11.920 --> 23:13.273
Norway.

23:13.800 --> 23:14.800
Wow.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.999
Yeah! Okay. Whoo!

23:18.280 --> 23:19.633
- Great!
- Yeah.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.475
Boys, I'm in.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.870
- What?
- Yes! Nice one!

23:25.040 --> 23:27.349
Um, no, wait.
We're, you're in what?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.831
The Viking Triathlon.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.673
Sixty miles on a bike, 30 miles on foot,

23:32.840 --> 23:35.752
and then a nice swim
through sub-zero Nordic seas.

23:35.920 --> 23:36.989
Yeah!

23:37.160 --> 23:38.639
That's our holiday?

23:38.800 --> 23:40.119
Yeah, but not all of it.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.919
Just the beginning,
and then we'll sightsee, or whatever.

23:43.080 --> 23:45.594
Look, I have never been fitter, Lou.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.830
This is the year to do it.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.954
I just thought I'd see
if I could fix some of these.

24:15.240 --> 24:17.276
Or, um, if you wanted to get new ones,

24:17.440 --> 24:18.696
I could go into town at lunch time.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.720
Or we could both go.

24:19.880 --> 24:20.995
<i>Do you know what, Louisa?</i>

24:21.160 --> 24:23.754
Me smashing those photographs
was not an accident.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.592
Sorry. I didn't think...

24:26.760 --> 24:28.876
You thought you knew best.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.880
Well, I don't want those
pictures staring at me

24:30.960 --> 24:32.080
every time I'm stuck in bed,

24:32.160 --> 24:34.549
waiting for someone to bloody
get me out again. Okay?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.870
I wasn't going to fix the one of Alicia.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.519
I'm not that stupid.

24:38.680 --> 24:39.908
Spare me the cod psychology.

24:40.120 --> 24:42.509
Just go and raid your grandma's wardrobe,

24:42.680 --> 24:44.910
or whatever it is you do
when you're not making tea.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.870
You don't have to be an arse!

24:50.800 --> 24:52.320
<i>Your friends got the shitty treatment.</i>

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
<i>Fine. They deserved it.</i>

24:53.520 --> 24:55.954
I'm just trying to do my job
as best I can.

24:56.120 --> 24:57.160
So it would be really nice

24:57.280 --> 24:59.120
if you didn't try and make
my life as miserable

24:59.160 --> 25:01.071
as you apparently make everyone else's.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.992
What if I said I didn't want you here?

25:03.160 --> 25:05.879
I'm not employed by you.
I'm employed by your mother.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.952
So unless she says she doesn't want me
here anymore, I'm staying.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.874
<i>Not because I care about you,
or particularly enjoy your company,</i>

25:13.040 --> 25:15.315
but because I need the money.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.271
I really need the money.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.070
Just put them in the drawer.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.234
Hi. Am I needed?

26:01.400 --> 26:03.630
DVD weather, I think.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.236
<i>Des Hommes Et Des Dieux.</i>

26:13.880 --> 26:15.313
Something about men?

26:15.760 --> 26:17.955
Yes, it's French gay porn.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.790
You really don't enjoy sarcasm, do you?

26:21.960 --> 26:24.633
Sarcasm is fine.
I just don't like superiority.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.631
You must hate me, then.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.270
I've never hated anyone.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.469
Let me know if you need anything.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.798
Have you seen it?

26:40.040 --> 26:42.349
I don't really like those kind of films.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.558
Those kind of films?

26:44.720 --> 26:46.199
Films with subtitles.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.430
What, did your school
not teach you to read?

26:49.360 --> 26:50.360
<i>Sit down.</i>

26:50.800 --> 26:52.950
Watch this with me. That's an order.

27:24.920 --> 27:27.275
- So?
- Well, they could have left.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.510
- They chose to stay.
- Yeah, no, I get it.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.096
Being there gave their lives more meaning.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.600
- But that's...
- But you don't agree.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.910
Well, to sacrifice themselves like that!

27:35.080 --> 27:36.256
I mean, could you even imagine?

27:36.280 --> 27:37.952
But you liked the film?

27:38.120 --> 27:39.473
I loved it.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.560
Oh, if you're laughing at me,

27:42.760 --> 27:43.936
I swear to God,
I'll push you out that chair.

27:43.960 --> 27:45.837
I'm not laughing at you.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.232
The sky is clearing.
Shall we get some air?

27:51.560 --> 27:52.754
I'm just amazed

27:52.920 --> 27:54.911
that you could reach
the ripe old age of, what?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.080
Twenty-six.

27:56.240 --> 27:59.391
Twenty-six, and never have
watched a film with subtitles.

27:59.560 --> 28:04.315
Oh, well, I'm just amazed
that you've reached the ripe old age of 31

28:04.480 --> 28:07.756
without being locked in a cupboard
for being such a snob.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.069
What?

28:09.240 --> 28:11.071
<i>E.T.</i> is my favorite film.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.992
<i>E.T.</i> is everyone's favorite film.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.390
- I've seen every Bond.
- So has the world.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.313
And I've got a soft spot for Armageddon.

28:18.480 --> 28:19.549
<i>Bruce Willis.</i>

28:19.760 --> 28:22.877
<i>Oil driller has to save the world
from an asteroid. He does.</i>

28:23.040 --> 28:24.632
That's better.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.473
So what do you do with yourself
when you're not here, Louisa Clark?

28:29.600 --> 28:31.636
I, uh... I spend time with my family.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.916
And I go to the pub.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.548
I watch TV.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.358
I... Oh, I watch Patrick running.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.317
- Patrick's your boyfriend?
- Yeah.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.478
But you don't run with him?

28:42.640 --> 28:44.710
I'm not exactly built for it.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.791
This is an impressive list of hobbies.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.155
Well, no, no. Okay, I read a bit.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.276
And I like clothes.

28:51.440 --> 28:53.158
You like clothes?

28:55.320 --> 28:56.878
I don't do much, okay?

28:57.040 --> 28:59.270
I go to work and I go home, and that's it.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.589
Wow.

29:01.480 --> 29:03.914
Your life's even duller than mine.

29:08.400 --> 29:10.277
He's in a good mood.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.671
He told me all about you offering him
the pasta with green gravy.

29:13.840 --> 29:17.150
I've... I've never
had pesto sauce before.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.880
No, whatever. It's all good.

29:20.040 --> 29:23.237
It's a long time since
he's laughed at anything.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.195
Hey.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.400
Hello there, Mr. Traynor.

29:51.440 --> 29:52.634
How are you doing today?

29:52.800 --> 29:54.280
Nathan, what are they doing in there?

29:54.720 --> 29:56.676
He has a checkup every six months.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.398
To see if he's getting better?

29:58.920 --> 30:00.751
No, it's a spinal-cord injury.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.856
He's not... He's not going to get better.

30:03.880 --> 30:06.519
But you do all those exercises with him.

30:06.920 --> 30:08.911
Yeah. That's to stop
his muscles atrophying.

30:10.680 --> 30:14.229
Will's body no longer works below here.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.550
Yeah, but he's still trying, right?

30:17.080 --> 30:19.435
He threw everything
into physio the first year,

30:19.600 --> 30:23.275
and all he got from it was
slight movement in his thumb and finger.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.910
Then the first bout of pneumonia hit,
then autonomic dysreflexia...

30:27.080 --> 30:28.559
What does that mean?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.352
Right. So his blood pressure

30:30.520 --> 30:31.560
- goes up and down.
- Yeah.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.233
He's constantly open to infection.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.710
But there's medical advances
taking place all the time. Right?

30:36.880 --> 30:38.711
Well, yeah.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.394
But no one's worked out
how to fix a spinal cord yet.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.951
Oh, I hear this one's good.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.235
Oh, because we suddenly speak Spanish?

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
No, it's got subtitles.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.710
It gets so you don't notice after a while.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.719
Two for the Will Ferrell, please.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.640
Oh.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.029
Is he okay?

31:34.240 --> 31:36.595
He's not great. Bit of a chill.

31:36.760 --> 31:37.875
Where's Nathan?

31:38.080 --> 31:39.593
I've called him. He'll be here soon.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.320
Look, Camilla's had to go up to London.

31:41.480 --> 31:42.680
Are you going to be all right?

31:43.560 --> 31:44.834
- Of course.
- Yeah?

31:45.000 --> 31:46.069
Yeah.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.510
I'm on my mobile, if you need me.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.835
Okay.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.832
Will, can I do anything?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.313
My pillows aren't right.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.308
Um, what do I do?

32:06.480 --> 32:11.156
Put your hand under my head,
on my neck, and just lift gently.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.588
Okay.

32:17.680 --> 32:19.716
- Oh, Jesus.
- What have I done?

32:19.880 --> 32:21.677
Your hands are freezing.

32:29.520 --> 32:30.748
Better.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.195
Can I get you some painkillers?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.630
- Yeah? Okay.
- Thank you.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.914
Will.

33:02.600 --> 33:03.749
Will?

33:07.360 --> 33:08.918
Will? It's...

33:10.720 --> 33:11.755
It's Lou.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.668
I know.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.600
Is there something
I should be doing?

33:19.760 --> 33:20.909
Some drugs or something?

33:21.080 --> 33:22.911
I'm just getting really worried.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.816
<i>Hello. This is Stephen.</i>

33:35.840 --> 33:39.515
<i>Please leave your name and number,
and I'll call you back.</i>

33:40.240 --> 33:41.912
Hi, Mr. Traynor. It's Lou. I'm just...

33:42.120 --> 33:43.553
I'm getting concerned about Will

33:43.720 --> 33:46.029
and I was wondering if
you could just call me back.

33:46.200 --> 33:47.838
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.798
G'day. This is Nathan.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.076
<i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>

34:00.760 --> 34:01.795
<i>Don't ring Mum.</i>

34:01.960 --> 34:02.960
What?

34:03.440 --> 34:05.510
We'll be fine, Clark.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.520
<i>Oi!</i>

34:18.199 --> 34:19.996
Sorry. Had to walk here.

34:20.199 --> 34:21.800
Took ages, the bloody weather, you know.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.920
How's things?

34:23.120 --> 34:25.280
Not great. He's in and out
and he's not drunk anything.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.456
How long's he been like this?

34:26.480 --> 34:27.674
Maybe four or five hours.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.496
I tried to call.
I did give him painkillers.

34:29.520 --> 34:30.856
Might as well have given him M&Ms.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.400
Well, he said he just wanted to sleep.

34:32.520 --> 34:33.953
Yeah, it's in the folder, Lou.

34:34.120 --> 34:35.871
Will doesn't sweat the way we do.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.440
If he gets even a slight chill,
his temperature goes haywire.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.216
- Yeah, but he said...
- Just go and get us a fan

34:40.239 --> 34:42.800
- and a damp towel, real quick.
- Okay.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.792
Hey, buddy. You all right?

34:45.960 --> 34:48.076
Will? You all right?

34:48.840 --> 34:50.068
I got you, mate. Come on.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.559
Come on. Yeah.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.835
Here.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.076
Hey, focus. Lou, you gotta
watch what I'm doing.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.316
- Sorry.
- That's right.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.991
<i>He's going to be okay.</i>

36:05.840 --> 36:07.136
There are very few people out there

36:07.160 --> 36:09.355
who can claim to have
out-Bonded James Bond.

36:09.560 --> 36:13.519
But birthday boy "Wild Willy" Will Traynor
is certainly one of them.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.557
<i>So, Will, any final thoughts, bro?</i>

36:15.760 --> 36:17.398
I'm thinking you should be next, mate.

36:17.560 --> 36:18.834
<i>Yeah, right!</i>

36:21.920 --> 36:23.056
<i>We're all thinking it.</i>

36:23.080 --> 36:25.435
<i>Is there really nothing he can't do?</i>

36:25.600 --> 36:27.989
- Do we hate him? Yes.
- We do!

36:28.200 --> 36:31.431
<i>But there's no point
in dwelling on that on his birthday.</i>

36:31.600 --> 36:33.955
<i>Thank God he's not good-looking.</i>

36:37.040 --> 36:38.234
Ah, stop!

36:38.400 --> 36:41.597
<i>You're watching
French gay porn, I hope.</i>

36:42.960 --> 36:45.554
Wi-Fi connection's not strong enough.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.752
What time is it?

36:47.920 --> 36:49.273
Where's... Where's Nathan?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.590
<i>Half eight. He had to
go to another patient.</i>

36:52.800 --> 36:54.677
Snow got pretty bad.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.630
Shouldn't you be at home?

37:00.960 --> 37:02.871
You're stuck with me.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.636
Will, can I ask you something?

37:12.800 --> 37:14.597
I suspect you're going to.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.635
What happened?

37:16.800 --> 37:19.633
My mother didn't tell you?
It's her favorite story.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.976
Some sort of traffic accident...

37:21.000 --> 37:23.434
- Motorbike.
- You were riding a motorbike?

37:23.600 --> 37:25.477
Actually, I wasn't.

37:27.400 --> 37:29.311
The bike hit me.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.718
Sorry. Sorry, I'm being chatty again,

37:33.880 --> 37:36.792
and you need to rest.

37:37.880 --> 37:38.880
No.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.553
Stay.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.400
<i>Tell me...</i>

37:42.920 --> 37:44.069
Tell me something good.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.475
I used to say that to my dad.

37:46.640 --> 37:49.359
But if I told you what he said back,
you'd think I was insane.

37:49.520 --> 37:51.511
Oh, that ship has sailed, Clark.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.435
When I had a nightmare or
something he used to sing.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.600
Go on.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.990
He used to sing the Molahonkey song.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.310
- The what?
- The Molahonkey song.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.560
I thought everyone knew it.

38:01.720 --> 38:04.792
Trust me, Clark. I'm a Molahonkey virgin.

38:04.960 --> 38:06.871
You're gonna make me sing it now?

38:28.200 --> 38:29.918
You're insane.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.758
<i>Your whole family is insane.</i>

38:31.920 --> 38:33.239
<i>And you're a God-awful singer.</i>

38:33.400 --> 38:35.152
I hope your dad was better.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.496
I think what you mean to say is,

38:36.520 --> 38:38.720
"Thank you, Miss Clark,
for attempting to entertain me."

38:39.360 --> 38:40.918
Okay, Clark.

38:41.680 --> 38:42.908
Tell me something else.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.640
Something that doesn't involve singing.

38:44.800 --> 38:45.835
About what?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.194
<i>Anything.</i>

38:48.000 --> 38:49.149
Well...

38:50.040 --> 38:52.634
When I was little,

38:52.800 --> 38:56.110
my mum got me a pair of glittery wellies,

38:56.280 --> 38:58.919
and I refused to take them off.

38:59.080 --> 39:03.392
I wore them in bed, in the bath,
all summer long.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.994
My favorite outfit

39:06.160 --> 39:08.799
was the glittery boots
and my bumblebee tights.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.234
Bumblebee tights?

39:10.400 --> 39:12.470
- Black and yellow stripes.
- Oh, dear God.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.837
I just... I really, really, really
liked having stripy legs.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.998
So what happened to these gorgeous wellies
and stripy tights?

39:19.160 --> 39:20.912
Ah! I outgrew them.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.354
It broke my heart.

39:22.520 --> 39:23.896
And they don't make those tights anymore.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.353
Not for grown women, anyway.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.669
Strange, that.

39:26.880 --> 39:29.599
Oh, you can mock. Didn't you
ever love anything that much?

39:31.800 --> 39:33.233
Yes.

39:34.200 --> 39:35.713
Yes, I did.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.160
<i>Interesting choice of footwear.</i>

40:19.680 --> 40:22.638
Patrick says they make me look
like a leprechaun drag queen.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.949
He was being nice.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.160
- Don't smile at me like that.
- Why not?

40:27.360 --> 40:28.998
Because I don't know what it means.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.470
Where did you pick up your exotic tastes?

40:31.640 --> 40:33.696
- What do you mean by that?
- It can't be from around here.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.720
Why not?

40:34.880 --> 40:36.216
Because this is the kind of
place people come to

40:36.240 --> 40:38.435
when they've got tired of actually living.

40:38.600 --> 40:40.397
People here think excitement is a new

40:40.560 --> 40:42.630
"Please be quiet" sign
going up in the library.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.520
You should be out there,
claiming the world as your own.

40:46.680 --> 40:48.671
Showing your leprechaun shoes
to dodgy men.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.189
- I like my life.
- You like everything.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.078
- I'm happy here.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

40:53.240 --> 40:55.754
Oh, you want me to be more
like the girls you know, do you?

40:55.920 --> 40:58.718
Go to London, marry somebody like Rupert.

40:58.880 --> 41:00.154
I believe he's taken.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.216
And ignore the fact that
he's shagging his secretary

41:02.240 --> 41:03.514
within five years.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.200
And bitch about him at dinner parties,

41:05.280 --> 41:07.561
knowing he won't leave because
he's scared of the alimony.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.551
And have sex once every six weeks,

41:09.720 --> 41:12.871
and listen to him going on and on about
how much he adores the children,

41:13.040 --> 41:15.429
while doing nothing
to actually take care of them.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.192
And have perfect hair,

41:17.360 --> 41:18.839
but get this kind of pinched face

41:19.000 --> 41:21.150
through never saying
what you actually mean.

41:21.320 --> 41:24.790
And develop an insane Pilates habit,
and buy a dog, or a horse,

41:25.000 --> 41:26.696
and develop a crush
on your riding instructor.

41:26.720 --> 41:29.871
And watch your husband take up
jogging when he hits 40

41:30.040 --> 41:31.040
and buy a Harley.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.998
And know that every day,
he goes into the office

41:34.160 --> 41:38.233
and looks at the young men,
and feels like, somehow, he got suckered!

41:38.400 --> 41:42.518
And leave him anyway, and come back here
to give the children a happy childhood.

41:42.880 --> 41:43.880
Whoa!

41:44.080 --> 41:46.878
There were a lot of divorce
handovers at the café.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.040
Sorry.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.838
How did you end up in that café?

41:50.000 --> 41:53.470
Treena made a bet
that I couldn't get a job in 24 hours.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.471
I proved her wrong.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.358
And stayed there six years. Way to go!

41:57.520 --> 41:58.953
I was supposed to leave.

41:59.160 --> 42:01.116
I had a place at Manchester.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.508
What were you going to study?

42:03.080 --> 42:04.308
Fashion.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.789
Mmm. So, why didn't you go?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.456
You know what I see when I look at you?

42:12.480 --> 42:15.074
- Don't say "potential."
- Potential.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.155
You need to widen your horizons, Clark.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.912
You only get one life.

42:20.080 --> 42:23.117
It's actually your duty
to live it as fully as possible.

42:24.240 --> 42:26.754
Well, you need a shave!

42:26.920 --> 42:29.559
If that beard gets any longer,
I'll be picking food out of it.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.917
And then I'll have to sue you
for undue distress in the workplace.

42:33.080 --> 42:34.798
- You're changing the subject.
- Yes.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.632
I am.

42:36.800 --> 42:37.869
Fine.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.199
I'll let you.

42:44.960 --> 42:46.951
You're really going to do this?

42:47.880 --> 42:48.995
I'm, uh...

42:49.160 --> 42:50.639
I'm really gonna do this.

42:50.800 --> 42:52.631
My mother's gonna be so happy.

42:52.840 --> 42:53.840
Yes, well,

42:54.480 --> 42:57.074
we won't let that put us off.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.309
You've got a funny look on your face.

43:39.480 --> 43:42.677
<i>Please don't tell me
you shaved off my eyebrows.</i>

43:42.840 --> 43:44.478
Only the one.

43:49.520 --> 43:51.795
<i>Freedom? You call this freedom?</i>

43:51.960 --> 43:53.234
<i>We all agreed to it.</i>

43:53.440 --> 43:55.396
Not the specifics. Jesus!

43:55.560 --> 43:57.200
If I hadn't noticed the Swiss postmark...

43:57.320 --> 43:59.311
We made an agreement with Will.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.799
Six months.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.394
<i>No. I only agreed
so that we had six months</i>

44:03.560 --> 44:04.788
<i>to change his mind.</i>

44:04.960 --> 44:08.748
<i>I cannot believe that you are willing
to help our son end his life!</i>

44:08.920 --> 44:12.913
I'd rather that than
risk him trying again, alone.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.957
It wasn't a cry for help, Camilla.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.917
He meant it. You know that.

44:17.080 --> 44:21.358
Now, this way we can be with him,
supporting him, loving him.

44:21.520 --> 44:24.080
- He's my son!
- Yes, he's my son, too!

44:25.440 --> 44:28.716
It's his choice. This is what he wants.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.075
You know how much pain he's in.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.155
He gave me six months.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.318
We can still persuade him.

44:51.240 --> 44:53.993
And you think the pretty waitress
is going to do that.

44:59.600 --> 45:03.036
Now, can I have the letter, please?

45:05.520 --> 45:06.839
Please.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.475
Apparently, the shave was your idea.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.798
Nice one! It looks great.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.309
<i>Now,
Arsenal, four. Liverpool, one.</i>

45:35.480 --> 45:36.480
Bye.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.753
I need you.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.636
I know we need the money,
but this is horrible.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.314
I'm basically just on suicide watch.

46:01.480 --> 46:03.152
I am not going back.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.351
- Yeah.
- What?

46:05.840 --> 46:07.478
<i>Come on. Say it.</i>

46:09.280 --> 46:11.236
I was thinking about him.

46:12.360 --> 46:13.998
Lou, you can't leave him.

46:15.720 --> 46:16.789
They've got money, right?

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
I don't want their money!

46:18.160 --> 46:19.991
No, not for you, idiot-girl!

46:20.160 --> 46:21.309
Look.

46:21.480 --> 46:24.199
If this is what he really wants,

46:24.680 --> 46:26.318
then use the time he's got left.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.118
Make it special.

46:29.640 --> 46:33.269
Ask the Traynors for a budget
and go crazy.

46:33.440 --> 46:36.750
Organize, I don't know,
swimming with dolphins, sky-diving.

46:36.920 --> 46:38.672
A nice, sexy lap dance.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.200
City boys always like a lap dance.

46:40.400 --> 46:41.799
Katrina Clark!

46:41.960 --> 46:43.393
A bucket list.

46:43.920 --> 46:46.150
Show him how good this time can be.

46:46.360 --> 46:49.397
Take him places. Make him laugh.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.233
Bloody hell.

46:53.960 --> 46:57.999
But, Treen, what if that list
could do more than that?

46:58.160 --> 47:01.072
What if it could make him change his mind?

47:39.040 --> 47:40.936
<i>Will's barely left
the house in two years.</i>

47:40.960 --> 47:41.995
We have tried.

47:42.200 --> 47:45.112
Yes, but we haven't succeeded.
If Louisa can come up with things

47:45.280 --> 47:46.952
that Will is able and prepared to do,

47:47.120 --> 47:49.031
then that's all for the good, surely.

47:49.480 --> 47:51.869
Sports, concerts.

47:52.040 --> 47:53.871
I'd love to see him
do any of these things.

47:54.040 --> 47:55.473
Okay. Okay.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.160
Louisa, if you can get me a schedule,

47:57.320 --> 47:59.136
I'll see if I can shift things
around in my diary.

47:59.160 --> 48:00.479
<i>No!</i>

48:00.640 --> 48:02.278
<i>Let him do it for himself.</i>

48:02.480 --> 48:05.790
Will needs to be allowed
to feel like a man.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.073
There you go.

48:41.560 --> 48:43.152
Oh, my God!

48:43.320 --> 48:44.639
What have you come as?

48:44.800 --> 48:45.994
I don't care what you think.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.310
Even if you have got a new haircut.

48:48.480 --> 48:49.959
You look like a madwoman.

48:50.120 --> 48:51.951
An oddly cheerful madwoman.

48:52.120 --> 48:55.351
We're taking Nathan
to see the horse racing.

48:55.680 --> 48:56.680
Horse racing?

48:56.840 --> 48:58.239
Yeah. Nathan's never been.

48:59.200 --> 49:00.679
Yeah. It's true.

49:00.840 --> 49:04.355
And, besides, I've got
five pounds on Man-Oh-Man

49:04.520 --> 49:05.999
at eight to one.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.515
My dad's mate, Jimmy,
says he's a sure thing.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.829
Just a wild guess,

49:10.000 --> 49:11.216
but you haven't been
racing before, either,

49:11.240 --> 49:12.355
have you, Clark?

49:15.520 --> 49:17.317
<i>The perfect spot.</i>

49:17.960 --> 49:20.155
<i>Look, we're so lucky.</i>

49:20.320 --> 49:22.356
Are you sure? This is too soft,
he's going to sink.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.416
Oh, no. He'll be fine.
It's gonna be great.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.317
Right. That's all right.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.635
Yeah?

49:29.240 --> 49:30.400
- Ah... Um...
- You all right?

49:31.400 --> 49:33.520
- What, do we need to?
- Look, you pull and I'll push.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.439
Okay.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.509
Oh! Shit. Um...

49:38.920 --> 49:41.229
Don't worry. It's only cashmere.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.400
Yeah. He's stuck

49:42.560 --> 49:44.176
I know, it's going to be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.634
- Oh, excuse me! Hi!
- You okay?

49:46.800 --> 49:48.392
- Hi. Sorry. Do you...
- Clark.

49:48.560 --> 49:50.357
Would you be able to help us?
With the, um...

49:50.520 --> 49:51.696
- Because we're a bit stuck.
- We're fine.

49:51.720 --> 49:53.216
- We're fine. We're fine.
- No, we're fine.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.560
Yeah? Would that be... Very kind.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.976
Come on, Will.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.434
You okay? Yeah! You're okay, aren't you?

49:58.640 --> 50:00.073
There we go. There we go.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.798
Brilliant! Thank you so much.

50:01.960 --> 50:03.336
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thanks, boys. Thanks, fellas.

50:03.360 --> 50:04.360
<i>No worries!</i>

50:04.560 --> 50:06.755
Guys, we're here!
It's gonna be fun!

50:09.080 --> 50:10.798
<i>Just a quick recap now...</i>

50:10.960 --> 50:12.359
Look, look, look. There he is.

50:12.520 --> 50:15.751
Don't you think he looks like
a sure thing, huh?

50:15.920 --> 50:16.920
Will?

50:17.080 --> 50:18.513
You're going to lose.

50:18.680 --> 50:19.874
How would you know that?

50:20.040 --> 50:23.794
His ears are flat, his coat is dull,
and he's got a funny walk.

50:23.960 --> 50:24.995
Great.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.040
So, you know everything
about horse racing, too.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.160
No.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.756
I just look, process information
and make decisions.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.790
<i>And that horse is
definitely not gonna win.</i>

50:35.040 --> 50:36.393
Yeah, well, I like him.

50:36.560 --> 50:38.869
Sometimes you just have to
go with your gut.

50:39.040 --> 50:41.349
I'm gonna go and place my bet.

50:46.560 --> 50:48.949
<i>They're lining up
at the gate now.</i>

50:49.120 --> 50:51.111
<i>Good to see My Blue Heaven
back after injury.</i>

50:51.280 --> 50:53.316
<i>State of Grace always
a bit reluctant going in.</i>

50:53.760 --> 50:55.273
<i>They're under starter's orders.</i>

50:55.440 --> 50:56.440
<i>And they're off!</i>

50:56.600 --> 50:59.512
<i>Greek God setting a good pace
on the inside with Little Jim ju... Oh!</i>

50:59.680 --> 51:00.880
<i>We seem to have a non-starter.</i>

51:01.040 --> 51:03.270
<i>Man-Oh-Man apparently having a day off.</i>

51:03.440 --> 51:06.398
<i>No, Aiden O 'Connor looks like
he's just not going to get him going.</i>

51:06.560 --> 51:08.456
<i>Well, the rest of the field
are now making their way</i>

51:08.480 --> 51:10.000
<i>along the straight at a cracking pace.</i>

51:12.560 --> 51:14.073
This is nice.

51:14.240 --> 51:16.151
Yeah, I love being spoon-fed in public.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.629
Hello! We'd like
a table for three, please.

51:18.840 --> 51:20.520
Of course. If I could just see your badge.

51:20.720 --> 51:21.720
Sorry?

51:21.880 --> 51:23.600
This restaurant's for
Premier Badge holders.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.958
Oh, well, we've got the pink badges!

51:27.120 --> 51:29.953
I'm sorry, we can only serve
Premier Badge holders.

51:30.560 --> 51:33.120
Um, okay, are there any other restaurants?

51:33.280 --> 51:35.794
Well, there's our relaxed dining area,

51:36.440 --> 51:38.351
and there are stalls outside.

51:38.520 --> 51:41.398
The Pig in a Poke does
a nice hog roast in a bun

51:41.560 --> 51:42.754
with apple sauce.

51:43.560 --> 51:46.552
Sharon. Can I call you Sharon? Yeah?

51:46.720 --> 51:51.032
So it's a quiet Monday afternoon
and you've got a lot of empty tables.

51:51.200 --> 51:54.317
We want to buy a really expensive meal.

51:54.480 --> 51:56.357
We don't want to
eat pork rolls at a stall,

51:56.520 --> 51:58.397
even with apple sauce.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.560
Oh, I'm really sorry.

51:59.760 --> 52:01.591
You need a Premier Area Badge.
It's policy.

52:01.800 --> 52:05.475
Okay, okay, okay. So how much
for a Premier Area Badge?

52:05.680 --> 52:07.680
What are we talking, like,
another 10? Another 20?

52:07.840 --> 52:09.831
We don't sell badges, madam.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.353
This is a restaurant.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.676
You'll have to go to the ticket office.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.876
Louisa. Let's go.

52:16.040 --> 52:17.216
<i>No, no, no. This is nuts.</i>

52:17.240 --> 52:18.593
We've come all this way.

52:18.760 --> 52:19.829
Louisa.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.194
I'm not hungry.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.874
I'm just gonna run
and get the badges,

52:24.040 --> 52:25.837
and then we will have our meal.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.036
We'll be fine once we've eaten. Yeah.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.394
Lou.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.755
I think Will wants to go home.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.912
You know what, Sharon?

52:39.920 --> 52:44.391
You can stick your Premier Badge
right up your relaxed dining area.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.320
Okay. Okay.

52:47.480 --> 52:49.072
Everything's fine.

53:05.320 --> 53:07.096
Great. So we're going to
paralyze your eardrums

53:07.120 --> 53:08.758
as well, now, are we?

53:14.240 --> 53:17.630
<i>So, maybe horse racing
wasn't my best idea.</i>

53:21.240 --> 53:24.596
<i>But this, I think you'll enjoy.</i>

53:24.800 --> 53:27.519
So Nathan's never been to
a classical music concert now?

53:27.720 --> 53:28.755
No. I haven't.

53:30.800 --> 53:32.916
Will you please come with me?

53:33.920 --> 53:35.478
<i>I bought the tickets a week ago.</i>

53:36.040 --> 53:37.439
You can say "no."

53:37.600 --> 53:39.318
A wind concerto?

53:39.480 --> 53:41.710
I've been assured
it doesn't involve farting.

53:43.520 --> 53:44.794
There's no chance of Jay-Z?

53:44.960 --> 53:48.589
Sadly, his tickets had just sold out.

53:51.200 --> 53:52.792
Mozart it is, then.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.514
Okay. Would this

54:01.680 --> 54:04.274
be the right sort of thing
to wear to a concert?

54:04.440 --> 54:06.590
<i>Metallica, no.</i>

54:06.800 --> 54:08.472
<i>Neil Diamond, possibly.</i>

54:08.680 --> 54:10.080
<i>I thought Pat was training tonight.</i>

54:10.200 --> 54:11.200
Oh, no. He is.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.557
<i>He is. I'm taking Will to a concert thing.</i>

54:14.720 --> 54:16.438
Sorry, you're going on a date?

54:16.600 --> 54:18.033
<i>It's too booby.</i>

54:18.200 --> 54:19.349
Way too booby.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.920
Given it's a man for whom your
boobs are mostly at eye-level.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.789
<i>Oh, you're so annoying!</i>

54:24.960 --> 54:27.872
You are so going on a date
with Will Traynor.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.675
Get the red dress out.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.273
<i>Really?</i>

54:34.040 --> 54:35.598
Kapow!

54:43.720 --> 54:45.119
Lose the scarf.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.474
The scarf? Why?

54:46.640 --> 54:48.995
If you're going to wear
a dress like that, Clark,

54:49.160 --> 54:50.878
you have to wear it with confidence.

54:51.040 --> 54:52.871
<i>Only you, Will Traynor,</i>

54:53.040 --> 54:56.032
would tell a woman
how to wear a bloody dress.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.189
- Here?
- Mmm-hmm.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.390
- Am I good?
- Yeah! Yeah.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.150
Yep, yep, yep. Yep.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.472
- Okay.
- Okay.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.039
Is everything okay?

55:29.320 --> 55:30.320
Mmm-hmm.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.829
Actually, no, there's something
digging into my collar.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.319
Okay.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.159
It's a tag.

55:40.320 --> 55:42.436
Have we got any scissors in the bag?

55:42.600 --> 55:43.669
I don't know, Clark.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.520
Believe it or not,
I rarely pack it myself.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.638
Um... Okay, hang on.

55:51.680 --> 55:53.796
Got it!

55:53.960 --> 55:56.080
We should just be grateful
it wasn't in your trousers.

55:56.200 --> 55:58.236
Oh, look. They're starting.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.470
So you're not a classical
music person, then?

56:45.640 --> 56:46.675
Hated every minute.

56:46.880 --> 56:48.279
Yeah, I could tell.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.478
Especially during that oboe solo.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.596
There was something in my eye.

56:54.320 --> 56:55.548
<i>I loved it.</i>

56:56.600 --> 56:58.192
<i>Did you?</i>

57:00.160 --> 57:01.309
Yeah.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.120
Right, we'd better get you in.

57:05.200 --> 57:06.269
Wait a minute, Clark.

57:06.480 --> 57:07.674
You okay?

57:07.840 --> 57:09.114
I don't...

57:10.000 --> 57:11.956
I don't want to go in yet.

57:14.840 --> 57:16.831
I just want to be a man
who has been to a concert

57:17.000 --> 57:18.831
with a girl in a red dress.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.356
Just a few minutes more.

57:56.560 --> 58:00.155
So, um...
Patrick wants to meet you.

58:01.120 --> 58:02.553
Running man? Why?

58:02.720 --> 58:05.792
I think he wants to know who I'm spending
all these late nights with.

58:06.280 --> 58:07.395
My parents do, too.

58:07.560 --> 58:10.438
I get nervous when a girl
asks me to meet her parents.

58:11.080 --> 58:14.755
They wanted me to invite you to
my birthday dinner next Thursday.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.831
But don't worry, I said
you wouldn't want to go.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.000
Why?

58:18.160 --> 58:19.200
Because you hate strangers

58:19.320 --> 58:20.616
and you don't like eating
in front of people.

58:20.640 --> 58:22.596
Seemed pretty obvious.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.794
I'll come.

58:25.480 --> 58:26.595
If you want me to.

58:31.080 --> 58:33.275
<i>Ah! Lads, welcome.</i>

58:33.440 --> 58:34.839
Bernard Clark.

58:35.960 --> 58:37.440
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

58:37.520 --> 58:39.397
A curtsy will be fine.

58:43.640 --> 58:45.596
Curtsy. Nice one.

58:45.760 --> 58:48.069
- This is Josie. My wife.
- Hello.

58:48.240 --> 58:50.549
- Come on in.
- Yeah! Come in, come in.

58:50.720 --> 58:52.073
Thank you.

58:52.520 --> 58:54.158
Listen, have fun.

58:54.880 --> 58:56.233
Thank you!

58:59.280 --> 59:00.349
Dear Lord,

59:00.520 --> 59:03.114
thank you for the food we eat,
and the company we keep.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.635
Thank you for the
opportunities you give us,

59:05.800 --> 59:09.315
and the strength to face the challenges
we meet on our journey.

59:10.520 --> 59:11.714
Amen.

59:11.880 --> 59:13.632
Amen.

59:17.800 --> 59:19.631
<i>So, Will.</i>

59:19.800 --> 59:21.870
You bought and sold companies?

59:22.480 --> 59:23.959
Something like that.

59:24.160 --> 59:27.197
Would you know this fella,
Alan Stonehouse?

59:27.360 --> 59:29.316
The one who...

59:29.480 --> 59:30.480
What is it?

59:30.640 --> 59:33.279
Asset stripped our firm?

59:33.440 --> 59:35.158
I'm afraid I trained him.

59:38.440 --> 59:39.953
Hmm.

59:40.240 --> 59:41.673
Oh, well...

59:41.840 --> 59:43.398
That's the door.

59:44.840 --> 59:45.875
Some chicken, love?

59:50.200 --> 59:52.760
Six miles in 28 minutes.

59:52.920 --> 59:55.514
And a happy birthday to my girlfriend!

59:55.680 --> 59:56.999
Yes! Happy birthday!

59:57.160 --> 59:59.151
- Sorry I'm a bit late.
- Oh, no!

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.999
Only 28 minutes.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.753
So couldn't you go back to it, Will?

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.656
I mean, clearly you're
still sharp as a tack.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.272
- Dad!
- No. It's fine.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.760
Truth is,

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:13.076
I thought I could crack this
and then go back,

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.673
as if nothing had changed.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.279
Uh, I was wrong.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.272
This is delicious, Mrs. Clark.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.239
Oh! Josie, please!

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.277
Well, we wanted to make today special.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.632
<i>Wish Treena could have been here.</i>

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.358
<i>She's the brains of the family.</i>

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.869
She got put up two years at school,
didn't she, Bernard?

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.189
Overtook our Lou.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.035
Not bright enough to stop herself
getting up the duff though.

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.233
Pat, shall I help you
to some more chicken?

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.075
So, Patrick, Louisa tells me
you're a personal trainer.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:50.713
Um, life coaching,
physical training, motivation.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:54.111
Local young entrepreneur of the year,
two years running.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.776
Lou tells me you were
a bit of an action man before.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:56.835
Pat.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.275
I bet if we got you on
a really good fitness regime.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.896
There's actually a Swedish study about

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.216
how you can train muscles to remember...

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240
Patrick!

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.671
What? I'm just trying to...

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.831
Yeah, well, don't.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.309
I'll bear it in mind.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.839
Thank you.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.433
Um, so, I just wanted to say
we're very proud of you, love.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.832
And, um... I don't know what we would
have done without you this past year.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.399
Aw, Dad.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.993
And, Will, thank you for employing her.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.355
- Someone had to.
- Hey!

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.275
Pleasure's all mine.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.555
Really.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:55.759
- Oh!
- Here.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.955
It's not much, but...

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.749
Granddad saw something on TV
about making your own presents.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.280
Aw!

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.959
Granddad, thank you.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.434
Thank you.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.675
I love it. Mum, thank you.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.518
Thank you.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.033
Mine next.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.159
Oh!

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.472
Go on, open it.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.671
- I had it made specially.
- Oh...

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.516
Thank you, Patrick.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.840
Oh!

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:43.960
Oh, wow.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.276
There's something for you
in my bag as well.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.273
You got Lou a present?
That's very kind of you.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.839
Wasn't that kind, Bernard?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.513
That's very kind.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.360
Okay.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.520
Oh!

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.518
It's very lovely.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480
Oh!

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.280
Oh, my God! I don't believe it!

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.194
- What?
- But where did you get them?

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.554
It's a secret.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.039
Tights?

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.191
Only the best pair of tights, ever!

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.799
Oh, I'm gonna go try them on.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.871
I'm gonna go try them on!

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.599
Oh, um...

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.314
I can't tell you how much I love them.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.710
Really! Thank you.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.436
I put some cake in your bag.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.991
Thank you, Josie.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.559
It's good to meet you all.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.029
And, Patrick, thank you for the

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.832
fitness advice.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.072
Just helping my girlfriend
get the best out of her job.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.593
Oh, you're a lucky man.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.352
She certainly gives a good bed bath.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.515
<i>Funny guy. I like him.</i>

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.957
So, I could take you
to a Shakespeare festival.

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.599
It's happening today and tomorrow.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.478
Or there's a sculpture park
we could visit.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.471
Or there's... Ooh, there's wine tasting.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.439
This came.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.315
<i>Ah.</i>

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.430
Can I take you somewhere?

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.632
<i>First kiss I ever had
was on that rampart.</i>

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.792
Probably didn't hurt
that you owned the castle.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.473
Maybe I should have told her.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.712
She dumped me a week later for a boy
who worked at the local shop.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:57.469
You're never gonna fit through there.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.151
Oh, wow. It's amazing!

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.797
Will? Will! No, please!

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.035
Will, stop!

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.633
Are you coming?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.710
This is a very bad idea.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.476
It's very dangerous.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.236
It's very, very high up.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.997
- And windy.
- Hmm.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.909
When I was a kid, this used to
be my favorite place

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.354
in the whole world.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.990
Did you walk around up here
pretending you were a warrior prince?

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.833
Even nicked a sword
from one of the exhibits.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.672
Weighed a ton.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.912
I think this would still be
my favorite spot.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.120
- That's because you haven't been anywhere.
- Oh...

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.636
So where's better than this, then?

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.440
Val d'Isère?

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.235
Paris.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:54.831
Place Dauphine, right by the Pont Neuf.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.514
Sitting outside a café
with a strong coffee

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.553
and a warm croissant
with unsalted butter and strawberry jam.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.030
So, let's go! We could get on
the Eurostar right now.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.633
- No.
- But you just said...

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:08.552
You don't get it, Clark.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.150
I want to be in Paris as me.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.157
The old me.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.078
With pretty French girls
giving me the eye.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.675
Could be something to look forward to.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.312
If I shut my eyes now,

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.712
I know exactly how it feels
to be in that little square.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.995
I remember every sensation.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.711
I don't want those memories erased
by the struggle to fit behind a table,

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.918
the taxi drivers who refuse to take me,

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.390
and my wheelchair power pack
that won't charge in a French socket.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.910
I'll tell you where we will go, though.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.229
Where?

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:53.995
Alicia's wedding.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.513
Really?

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.152
Will you come with me?

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.072
If you want me to.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.712
<i>Hello?</i>

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.272
- Whoo! Jesus, Mum, hello!
- Too much?

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.589
Oh, sod it. I don't care.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.955
<i>We are celebrating, Lou.</i>

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.596
- I've got a job!
- Oh!

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.119
Dad, that is fantastic!

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.909
You are looking at the new
Head of Maintenance at the castle.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.836
- God, that's just...
<i>- I know. I know.</i>

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.195
Mr. Traynor rang me himself.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.828
So I'm starting tomorrow
morning, month's trial.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.389
Isn't it brilliant? It's good money, Lou.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:35.154
- And he gets his own van.
- Oh!

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.360
See you.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.555
Okay.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.470
I thought you'd be pleased.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.792
<i>No, I am! I am pleased.</i>

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.030
<i>I just... I don't know. I feel weird.</i>

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.997
Well, don't.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.628
Your dad needed a job,
mine needed a head of maintenance.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.518
Yeah, but it's just the timing.

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:53.829
It's just a bit...

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.513
It's good.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.636
Your dad will be great.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.273
And it means...

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.153
It means what?

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.471
<i>It means... It means that one day
you can go off and spread your wings</i>

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:07.194
<i>without worrying about everyone else.</i>

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.669
<i>Put yourself first, for once.</i>

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.120
Hello.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:21.675
Michael Lawler.
I'm here to see Mr. Traynor.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.671
Oh, no, no, no. You've got the wrong door.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:25.558
- He lives...
- It's okay, Clark.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.038
How was traffic, Michael?

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.880
Oh, you know. Once you're out of London...

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.519
We'll sit in the courtyard.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:32.750
You can leave us. Thanks, Clark.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:36.037
How have you been?

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.679
Oh, well, thank you.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.156
I thought he seemed happier.
He was smiling, laughing.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.639
Me, too.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.352
Well, thank you for telling me.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.591
- Louisa.
- Yeah?

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.274
You will look after him
at the wedding, won't you?

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:33.156
I still don't know
why we're doing this.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:34.840
We're going to behave admirably.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.752
Just so you know,
if you do the <i>My Left Foot</i> thing,

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.435
I will drive home and leave you stuck here
with all your ex-girlfriends.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.953
Spoilsport.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.313
Ah!

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.472
Will, hi.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.870
It's, uh... It's so good to see you again.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.560
The office isn't the same without you.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.921
One minute you were there
running everything and everyone,

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.475
and the next, well,
it's, uh, just not the same.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.870
It's kind of you to say so, Freddie.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.080
Ah, oh...

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.992
Louisa Clark, Freddie Foster.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.912
Yes! Yes, I saw you at the church.

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.634
Life isn't all bad then, eh?

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.068
Will.I.Am.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.999
Anyway, anyway, must mingle.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.240
It's good to see you, Will.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:52.396
And you, Miss Clark.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.753
He's a nice guy.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.920
He fancies you.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:58.672
He needs glasses.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.353
<i>Don't do that.</i>

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.588
You look beautiful.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.316
Well, you don't look so shabby yourself.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.877
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.068
<i>I give you the bride and groom,
Mr. and Mrs. Rupert Collins!</i>

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.949
Oh, God!

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:39.556
There ought to be a law
against Englishmen on dance floors.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.235
Bride or groom?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:43.873
Oh, neither.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:45.915
You?

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.595
Godmother to the bride.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.115
Which makes me morally
responsible for her.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.878
Not one of my finer acts.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.600
Oh, you don't think much of her, then?

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.159
This is a bit depressing.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:57.320
Mmm.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.120
Still, one can't do these things sober.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.390
Oh, no, wait,
there's alcohol in this stuff?

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.551
Absolutely, darling.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.518
And I firmly encourage you
to get as drunk as possible.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.240
I hear rumors

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:10.549
that the father of the bride

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.880
is going to inflict another speech on us.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.430
Oh, no. I'm supposed to be
driving Will home.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.596
Ah, yes. Young Will.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.512
He was her chance, you know.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.148
Only one of that lot
that was worth a damn.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.435
Terrible shame.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.715
Well, he's not dead.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.313
No, I meant for her, not him.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.433
No, Rupert's an arsehole.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.191
You take care of him.

01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:33.839
He's a good one.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.276
Take it from one who knows.
Four marriages and counting.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.110
Thank you so much for coming, Will.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.474
It was a lovely day.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.278
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.880
You remember Louisa?

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.678
<i>Oh, yes. Yes.</i>

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.035
Anyway, you're a real star for being here.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.475
And thank you for the, um...

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:13.235
- For the...
- Mirror.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:15.516
Yes, the mirror.
Absolutely love that mirror.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.913
Anyway, thank you.

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:21.833
You didn't buy her a mirror.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.314
I know.

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:24.799
Okay, you.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.711
And, what do you say?
You gonna give me a whirl?

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.150
What? How many of those did you drink?

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.357
Come on, let's give these tossers
something to talk about.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.839
- All right.
- Whoo.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.516
- He's ruining everything.
- And her.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.033
Are they all appalled?

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.519
Yes.

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.995
Yeah.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:49.949
Move closer. You smell fantastic.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:54.351
You never would've let
those breasts so near to me

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.669
if I wasn't in a wheelchair.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.840
Oh, yeah?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.976
Well, you never would've been
looking at these breasts

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.400
if you hadn't been in a wheelchair.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.520
What? Of course, I would.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.033
No, you wouldn't.

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.400
You would've been too busy
looking at the leggy blondes.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:08.671
The ones who can smell
an expense account at 40 paces.

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.519
And, anyway, I would've been
over there serving the drinks.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.193
One of the invisibles.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.759
Am I right?

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.195
Yes, but in my defense...

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.952
I was an arse.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.348
Yep.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.475
Do you know something, Clark?

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.437
You are pretty much the only thing

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.320
that makes me want to get up
in the morning.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.191
Then let's go somewhere.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.039
Anywhere in the world. Just you and me.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.639
What do you say?

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.116
Say yes, Will.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.549
Go on.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.757
- Okay.
- Yeah?

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.154
All the way to the hotel.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.120
This is going to go very wrong.
You know that?

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.310
No, this is going to be brilliant!

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.560
Oh...

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:56.757
I don't think you're driving
in a straight line!

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.576
Why didn't you return
any of my calls?

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.238
I was worried sick.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.440
Are you all right?

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:16.296
I think I'm old enough to
spend a night in a hotel

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.197
without permission, Mother, okay?

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.275
Okay.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.274
Right.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.832
I'm guessing she didn't do your tubes.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.116
She did manage to get the
porter to help me into bed.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.316
This is not good, mate. You're sweating.

01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:40.436
Look at me. How's your eyesight?

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.995
I'm pretty sure you're Nathan. Am I right?

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:45.833
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you've
been on the drink. Am I right?

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.035
I'll be fine.

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.269
Jesus, Will.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:50.630
We had a nice time.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.639
You what?

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.515
I'm not coming to
Xtreme whatever-it's-called.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:56.999
To Norway.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.879
They need me at work!

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.240
But you said you'd support me.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.992
I am supporting you, Patrick!

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.794
I hate cycling, and you know I do.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.308
But there's this trip
I've got to go on with Will.

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.637
Why can't they just get an agency nurse?

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.998
Because it's my job!

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.316
What is this, Lou?

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:22.994
Your job seems to take priority
over everything these days.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:26.152
Patrick, this is important, okay?
Trust me.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.753
But it's Norway!

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.038
It's meant to be our holiday!

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.038
I just can't.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.788
Oh, Pat.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.599
He's stable.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.750
But pneumonia?

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.558
He only had a cough on Saturday morning.

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:07.877
His lungs are weak,
any bacteria hits him hard.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.473
Can I go in?

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.551
Oh, Camilla's with him.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.676
Best leave her to it.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.474
It's his fourth bout in two years.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.915
The last one nearly killed him.

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.115
Thank you.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:49.313
How's he doing?

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.390
He's a little better, I think.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.952
Would you like me to
take over for a while?

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:03.593
I would really like to change my clothes.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.909
Sure.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:38.909
Hey.

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.031
How are you feeling?

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.635
Been better.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.195
Oh, I don't know.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.828
You'll do anything
for attention, Will Traynor.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.152
I don't think I can do witty today, Clark.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.399
Hey, just dropping off

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.320
- some meds for when he gets back.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.349
You all right?

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.239
Yeah, yeah.
Just, um, canceling everything.

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.556
You know, don't you?

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.553
Yeah.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.029
Oh, I've been with him two years.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.519
His life is hard.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.112
He hides his pain when he's with you.

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.160
But there have been times
when I've stayed over,

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:51.793
and I hear him screaming.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:55.032
In his dreams, he's still
running or skiing,

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.428
doing things, you know.

01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:00.315
And then he wakes up
and there's nothing I can say to him.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.397
Now, I can't judge what he wants to do.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.118
That's his choice.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.914
But that was before me.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:13.517
Yeah, and I know that he did pretty much
anything to make you happy.

01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.116
Look, I want him to live, Lou.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.871
But only if he wants to live.

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.111
I can't just let this happen.

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:23.954
I can't.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.270
And we're running out of time.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:32.117
So, if I could come up with another trip
that the doctors would agree to,

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.589
would you come with us?

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.553
Yeah.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.199
Of course I would.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.435
Hi.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.995
This is unexpected.

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.271
I've bought your parents cinema tickets

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.670
and Granddad's in his room.
Asleep, I think.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.035
You bribed my parents
and jailed my granddad.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:05.349
Good.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.953
I am an idiot.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:09.190
But this job of yours
is just for a few more weeks.

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.715
Things will soon be back to normal.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:16.150
I should be proud that you're
doing something worthwhile.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.794
I don't want to argue with you, Lou.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.314
- Less than 300 calories.
- Mmm.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.879
What's this?

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.516
Oh, it's the trip I told you about.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.238
I thought you meant Lourdes or something.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.916
"Hot tub under the stars."

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.514
"Massages. Swim with dolphins."

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.911
Oh, look. "Five-star luxury,
24-hour room service."

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.312
This isn't work.

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:56.336
Do you really expect me to just sit here

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.749
while you swan off with
another man on a honeymoon?

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.319
His other caregiver's coming, too.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:02.914
Oh, two guys. That's all right, then.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.036
Patrick, this is really important.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.591
Do you know how this feels?

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.548
It's like I'm running permanently

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.359
just a little behind
the rest of the field.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:17.512
It's like, there's something
bad around the bend,

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.671
and everyone seems to
know what it is except me.

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.909
Patrick...

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.759
Seven years we've been together, Lou.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.831
You've known him five months.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.109
But he needs me.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.033
And I don't?

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.233
I'm sorry.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.871
Well, you got him here.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.069
- Cheers, mate.
- Thank you, sir.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.754
<i>Bienvenue.</i>

01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.957
Let me show you to your rooms.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.593
Hey, you.

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.599
How are you feeling?

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:55.720
Better.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.195
So, what's the plan for today?

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.280
Um, well, we can stay here for a bit.

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.112
Because they rent DVDs at the front desk.

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.556
We didn't come all this way
to watch DVDs, Clark.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.238
Stop, stop. Hey!

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.480
Oh!

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.035
Is there alcohol in that?

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.832
Rum, vodka and Cointreau, sir.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.592
She'll have two, please.

01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.478
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.914
Oh, I booked you in
for scuba diving tomorrow.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.152
Even after I said I didn't want to. Will!

01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:58.709
- Hey!
<i>- Hi.</i>

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.393
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hi.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.437
I'm gonna walk Karen back to her hotel.

01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:04.750
I'm just not sure she should
walk back alone.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.194
Very chivalrous of you.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.316
Yeah, it's very civic-minded.

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.311
Oh, piss off, the both you.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.416
Yeah, I've got everything
covered, don't worry.

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.440
We'll be fine.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.398
All right. Yeah, we'll see you later.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:19.391
- Bye!
- Have fun.

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:32.715
No, don't.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.598
<i>Leave them open.</i>

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.875
I wanna see it.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.113
Don't go back to your room tonight, Clark.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.558
- Just do it.
- No, I can't! I can't.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.153
It's gonna be too deep, so I can't.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.799
You can. You can do anything.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.548
Mmm-mmm.

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:06.511
Why didn't you make me do that earlier?

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:07.999
That was amazing!

01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.633
I don't know, Clark!

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:11.756
Some people just won't be told!

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:22.076
I don't wanna go home.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.673
This has...

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.836
This has been the best.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.273
<i>You're glad you came, right?</i>

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.509
Yes.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.509
You.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.158
You are something else, Clark.

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.555
Well.

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.875
I have to tell you something.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.040
I know.

01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.748
I know about Switzerland.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.995
I have known for months.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:38.188
Listen, I know this is not
how you would have chosen it,

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.717
but I can make you happy.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.711
- No.
- What?

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.194
No, Clark.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.432
I get that this could be a good life.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.114
But it's not my life.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.757
It's not even close.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.996
You never saw me before.

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.191
I loved my life.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:06.392
I really loved it.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.837
I can't be the kind of man
who just accepts this.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.070
You're not giving it a chance.

01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.999
You're not giving me a chance.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:22.793
I have become a whole new person
these last six months because of you.

01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:26.311
I know. And that's why
I can't have you tied to me.

01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:29.158
I don't want you

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.590
to miss all the things that
someone else could give you.

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:37.192
And selfishly, I don't want
you to look at me one day

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:40.352
and feel even the tiniest bit
of regret or pity.

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:41.913
I would never think that!

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.479
You don't know that.

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.590
I can't watch you

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:50.196
wandering around the annex
in your crazy dresses.

01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.874
Or see you naked and not...

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.874
Not be able to do...

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.596
Oh, God, Clark, if you had any idea
what I wanna do to you right now.

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:10.311
I can't live like this.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:13.478
Please. Will, please.

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.273
Listen.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.713
This,

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.792
tonight, being with you

01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:27.829
is the most wonderful thing
you could have ever done for me.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.114
But I need it to end here.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:37.790
No more pain and exhaustion

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:42.238
and waking up every morning
already wishing it was over.

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:47.074
It's not going to get better than this.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.913
The doctors know it and I know it.

01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:57.509
When we get back,
I am going to Switzerland.

01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.551
So I'm asking you

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:02.917
if you feel the things you say you feel,

01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.232
come with me.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.478
I thought that
I was changing your mind!

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.551
Nothing was ever going to change my mind.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:17.113
I promised my parents six months,
and that's what I've given them.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.711
No!

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.359
No.

01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.954
Don't say another word.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.951
You're so selfish.

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:34.911
I tore my heart out in front of you,
and here all you can say is no.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.558
And now you want me to come and watch

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:40.354
the worst thing
you could possibly imagine.

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:42.875
Do you have any idea what you're asking?

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.030
I wish I had never taken this stupid job!

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.714
I wish I had never met you.

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.388
Louisa.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.588
Louisa!

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.237
You all right?

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.549
Fine.

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.876
Oh, look at you.

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.600
- You look wonderful!
- You do.

01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:59.954
Great photos of you on the beach.
Swimming, too?

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.633
Yeah, it was great.

01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.794
How was the flight?

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.996
Well, we got here in one piece.

01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:11.637
Are you hungry? 'Cause we can eat
at the restaurant in the Intercontinental.

01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:13.711
- I could eat.
- Excellent.

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:16.155
Louisa, let me give you a hand with those.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.914
Actually, I need to get home.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:21.469
Come on. We want to know how you got on.

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:22.993
Let her go.

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.315
Louisa!

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.114
Louisa!

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.194
Louisa!

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.355
Wait. Louisa, please.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:43.999
You don't need to pay me.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.039
I'm sorry.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Well?

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:45.434
Sit down, Josie, love. Please.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.238
Lou's upset enough.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.277
And his parents know?

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:53.991
I mean, what kind of people are they?

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.118
Mrs. Traynor doesn't know
what else she can do.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.595
It's his choice.

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.990
Some choices you don't get to make.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.479
He's not in his right mind.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.136
People that are vulnerable
should not be given a chance to...

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.593
It's complicated, Mum.

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.478
- It is not. It's simple.
- Mum.

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.313
No. You can't be a part of this.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.599
It's no better than murder.

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.036
I tried, Dad.

01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.990
I tried so hard,

01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.678
but I failed.

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:02.229
Who says you failed?

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.957
I'm not sure anyone in the world

01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:14.433
could ever persuade that man,
once he'd set his mind to something.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.910
You can't change who people are.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.112
Then what can you do?

01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:21.599
You love them.

01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:25.600
No one could have done more than you.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:30.233
You have a heart as big as that castle,
and I love you for it.

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.036
Have you seen them? Mr. Traynor?

01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.674
They left. This morning.

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:42.754
Dad, have I made a huge mistake?

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.679
Call them.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.311
You still have time.

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.955
<i>Don't worry. Mum will come round.</i>

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.872
<i>I'll talk to her.</i>

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.598
<i>You're doing the right thing, Lou.</i>

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.038
You have to go.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.314
You were useless until you met him.

01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.989
Hello.

01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:54.989
Hello.

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:56.673
He's just through there.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:57.840
Okay.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.115
Here.

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.111
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:13.554
Oh!

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.199
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.796
The familiar sound of Louisa Clark
making an entrance.

01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.077
We'll leave you be.

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:30.515
Thank you.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.719
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.075
You're here to make my last cup of tea.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:47.238
Actually, no.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.356
I'm here to kidnap you.

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.080
I'm gonna steal you and
I'm gonna take you to...

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.400
<i>Where?</i>

01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:54.834
<i>- Rio.
- Mmm.</i>

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:58.195
<i>Or my mum and dad's.
I haven't quite decided yet.</i>

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.753
Open the doors, Clark.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.034
Come here.

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.279
Closer.

01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.473
Look at me.

01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.270
Please, look at me.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.389
I can't.

01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:02.709
Tough.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:04.836
I need to see that face.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.469
I need to see that face of yours.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:12.438
Even if it is all pink and blotchy.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.072
You really are the most
impossible man, Will Traynor.

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:22.312
And the world will definitely
be a better place without me.

01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:23.674
No.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.034
No, it won't.

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.750
Don't be sad, Clark.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.275
Tell me something good.

01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:11.430
Will you stay?

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:15.720
For as long as you want me to.

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:07.269
Can you call my parents in?

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.148
<i>Clark.</i>

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.957
<i>A few weeks should have passed
by the time you read this.</i>

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:09.078
<i>If you followed the instructions,
you'll be in Paris</i>

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:12.471
<i>on one of those chairs that never sit
quite level on the pavement.</i>

01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.750
<i>I hope it's still sunny.</i>

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.799
<i>Across the bridge to your right
you will see L 'Artisan Parfumeur.</i>

01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.599
<i>You should try the scent
called Papillons Extrême.</i>

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.149
<i>I always did think
it would smell great on you.</i>

01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:34.516
<i>There are a few things
I wanted to say and couldn't,</i>

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:38.673
<i>because you would have got all emotional
and you wouldn't have let me finish.</i>

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:43.274
<i>So, here it is.</i>

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.029
<i>When you get back home,</i>

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:47.509
<i>Michael Lawler will give you
access to a bank account</i>

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.148
<i>that contains enough
to give you a new beginning.</i>

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.117
<i>Don't start panicking.</i>

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:54.874
<i>It's not enough for you to sit around
for the rest of your life,</i>

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.554
<i>but it should buy you your freedom.</i>

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.553
<i>At least from that little town
we both call home.</i>

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.151
<i>Live boldly, Clark.</i>

01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:05.554
<i>Push yourself.</i>

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.153
<i>Don't settle.</i>

01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:10.868
<i>Wear those stripy legs with pride.</i>

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:14.237
<i>Knowing you still have
possibilities is a luxury.</i>

01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:19.076
<i>Knowing I might have given them to you
has eased something for me.</i>

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:22.674
<i>So, this is it.</i>

01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:26.837
<i>You are scored on my heart, Clark.</i>

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.991
<i>You were from the first day you walked in</i>

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:31.754
<i>with your sweet smile
and your ridiculous clothes.</i>

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.558
<i>And your bad jokes</i>

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:37.469
<i>and your complete inability to ever hide
a single thing you felt.</i>

01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:40.910
<i>Don't think of me too often.</i>

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:43.477
<i>I don't want you getting sad.</i>

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:45.232
<i>Just live well.</i>

01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.998
<i>Just live.</i>

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.431
<i>I'll be walking beside you
every step of the way.</i>

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.192
<i>Love, Will.</i>

01:45:56.305 --> 01:46:02.498
