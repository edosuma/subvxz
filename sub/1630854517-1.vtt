WEBVTT

00:58.641 --> 01:00.351
Hmm.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.897
Hmm!

01:03.980 --> 01:06.149
I think I outdid myself
with this one.

01:08.109 --> 01:11.279
Thank you for agreeing
with me.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.662
Oh. Hi, there!
Welcome to Chloe's Cakes!

01:19.746 --> 01:23.249
-What can I get you fellas?
-I'm looking for the owner,
Ms. Chloe Donner.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.126
Well, that is me.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.754
-Hello, my name is Jeb.
-Hi, Jeb. I'm Chloe.

01:27.837 --> 01:30.423
-I work in the city
for Landmark Real Estate.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.592
You have 30 days
to vacate these premises.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.137
No.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.224
No. That can't be right.
You're evicting me
at Christmas?

01:39.307 --> 01:42.727
This building
is being repurposed to
maximize financial positions.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.104
-Look, it's nothing personal,
it's just--

01:49.108 --> 01:50.401
-Seriously?
-I'm sorry.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.571
That's okay,
I will just take it back.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.284
Yeah.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.331
No, that can't be right.
You're evicting me at--

02:03.414 --> 02:05.917
-I'm Sorry!
-Oh, dude! What?

02:06.000 --> 02:07.460
Oh, my God.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.087
-Okay, let's cut!

02:09.170 --> 02:10.463
-That's a cut.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.799
What is this guy,
allergic to Christmas?

02:12.882 --> 02:15.510
...I need a block.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.639
Want me to handle it?

02:19.722 --> 02:21.891
No, I got it.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.560
All right, everybody,
take five!

02:30.066 --> 02:32.735
Hey, are you all right?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.822
I'm sorry.
I'm allergic to dogs.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.950
Daniel?

02:39.033 --> 02:43.204
It is specifically noted
in the casting call:
no dog allergies.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.415
I really needed this job.

02:45.498 --> 02:49.878
-All right. Can we get you
an allergy pill or something?
-I took two already.

02:49.961 --> 02:54.048
-Okay, take a break. And--

02:54.132 --> 02:55.717
Bless you.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.469
...get a snack
at the craft services table.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.513
And we'll use you later.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.472
I'm so sorry.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.058
Thank you.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.810
-Um, Jessica?
-Yes.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.854
-I have a quick question.
-Sure.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.815
When Zooey barks,
how do I know
what she's saying?

03:12.650 --> 03:14.652
You don't actually.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.113
Okay, so,
I don't speak dog language?

03:17.196 --> 03:22.201
It's more like Zooey
reflects your inner feelings
back to you.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.370
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.872
So, she's a psychic dog?

03:26.539 --> 03:27.415
Um...

03:29.792 --> 03:30.960
Yeah.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.588
She is a little bit psychic.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.008
-That's wild.
-Right?

03:37.091 --> 03:38.259
Okay, cool.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.427
Okay, let's try this again.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.013
Wow.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.727
Back to one, everyone!

03:47.810 --> 03:50.396
Wait. Jeb needs three lawyers
with him.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.565
-It'll work with two.
-It needs to be three.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.322
-Sorry.
-Okay. You! Go outside!

04:01.282 --> 04:02.116
You!

04:03.952 --> 04:04.994
Come fill in here.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.332
-Me?
-Yes, come on.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.167
-Let's go.
-You want me to... What?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.211
-What's your name?
-I'm Christopher.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.380
Christopher,
are you allergic to dogs?

04:15.463 --> 04:17.924
-No.
-Great.
You're in the scene now.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.384
-Come on.
-Okay.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.928
I'll hold these.
Let's get you in there.

04:22.011 --> 04:25.515
So, you follow those guys,
Christopher. You are
one of the lawyers now.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.308
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.726
I always thought
I'd be a good lawyer.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.020
Let's put a pin in that,
and just...

04:31.938 --> 04:33.648
break a leg.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.234
Costumes, can we
have the jacket flown in
for our new lawyer, please.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.403
Let's make this happen, people.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.322
Thank you.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.496
Oh, no, don't do that...
Yeah, just blend into
the background, yeah.

04:49.580 --> 04:51.457
Okay, new guy.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.502
Yeah, okay, over here.
So, this is how
it's gonna work.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.379
He's gonna open the door.

04:56.462 --> 05:00.049
You're going to file in fourth,
and you're going
to land back left.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.217
-Cool.
-You clear?

05:01.300 --> 05:03.720
-Yeah.
-All right. Let's go.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.930
Clear the set.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.807
Everyone in first positions.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.517
Ready, Jess?

05:11.310 --> 05:12.228
Call it, Daniel.

05:12.311 --> 05:15.189
Roll sound! Roll camera!

05:16.315 --> 05:17.150
Rolling.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.446
Scene three. Take two. Mark.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.323
Action.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.884
Reena?

05:42.967 --> 05:45.928
-Right here.
-How many singers do we have
for the caroling scene?

05:46.012 --> 05:48.765
I asked Daniel for 12
like you said, so we got six.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.724
Perfect.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.645
I sent you my notes
on the bakery logo, Cooper.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.731
I got them.
Uh, making the changes.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.098
Excuse me,
Jessica?

06:31.974 --> 06:34.477
Lawyer guy. Christopher, right?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.229
Did you not
get your chips back?

06:36.312 --> 06:38.314
I grabbed another bag.

06:38.397 --> 06:41.400
Great. Well, thanks
for jumping in there.
The second AD can sign you out.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.823
Oh.
I'm not an extra.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.158
Well, you weren't the lead.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.412
No, I just started working with
the network. I came by the set
today to introduce myself.

06:54.997 --> 06:56.749
Oh.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.001
I'm sorry, I...

07:00.002 --> 07:01.671
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

07:01.754 --> 07:03.631
What?
And miss out on my big break?

07:03.714 --> 07:07.176
Sorry.
Uh, it's just, you know,
the suit, kind of, threw me.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.803
But it's really nice
to meet you.

07:09.929 --> 07:10.805
You too.

07:13.057 --> 07:16.811
Oh, and I'm supposed
to tell you we're shutting down
the Christmas Movie division.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.650
That is a funny joke,
Christopher. You do make
a good lawyer.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.279
I'm afraid it's not a joke.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.867
What? Uh...

07:32.326 --> 07:34.704
Does Kelly know about this?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.789
She's no longer
with the company.

07:36.873 --> 07:41.627
-What about Steven?
-He's moved on, also.
Theresa is in charge now.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.423
-Who's Theresa?
-It's a whole new team.
Massive shake-up.

07:45.506 --> 07:50.595
Geez. You guys should
really think about putting out
a newsletter or something.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.806
The market is dominated by
the two "Christmas channels."

07:53.890 --> 07:56.058
It's not a financial win
for us to compete,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.269
so we're trying
a whole new direction
for programming.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.229
-Which is?
-Thrillers, mostly.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.607
Women in peril,
ripped-from-the-headlines,
that kind of thing.

08:02.690 --> 08:06.360
So, you want the cupcake girl
to be abducted by terrorists?

08:06.444 --> 08:08.738
That's actually
a really good idea.

08:08.821 --> 08:12.116
-I have a contract for three
more Christmas movies.
-Not with the new team.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.578
Everyone loves
Christmas movies.

08:16.871 --> 08:20.208
Do they? Aren't they all
a little predictable?

08:20.291 --> 08:24.420
That's a feature, not a bug.
That's the whole point
of Christmas movies.

08:24.503 --> 08:25.421
Tell him, Reena.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.676
Big city boy
meets small town girl,
they have conflict.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.013
Small town charm wins out
over the cruel unfeeling
corporate world.

08:34.096 --> 08:37.808
The lovers use Christmas magic
to save the day
and fall hopelessly in love.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.482
Oh, and, if he's secretly
a prince, it's a double whammy.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.526
Aren't you bored
just talking about it?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.779
It's not boring,
it's comforting.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.281
It's curling up
with a cup of hot cocoa

08:52.365 --> 08:55.117
or snuggling in front of
a fire on a snowy night.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.954
-Are those things
boring to you?
-Those things are simple.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.456
That's why they're comforting.
Our movies need to be complex.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.833
They need to have layers.
They need to surprise
the audience.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.586
This is my brand,
Christopher.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.755
I'm good at this.

09:07.838 --> 09:11.592
Do you know how hard it is
for a female director to build
a reputation in this town?

09:11.676 --> 09:13.970
I'm gonna finish this movie
on my terms,

09:14.053 --> 09:15.721
because apparently after this,
I'm out of a job,

09:15.805 --> 09:17.723
because some suits don't
believe in Christmas magic.

09:17.807 --> 09:21.602
Christmas magic is like snow
in LA. There's no such thing.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.398
Okay. Thank you
for the heads up.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.235
We can talk more
about it tomorrow if you want.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.907
-What's tomorrow?
-It's day two, right?

09:34.991 --> 09:37.451
I'm going to be on set
for all of production.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.328
That's not necessary.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.163
The network wanted me
to keep a close eye
on the budget spend.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.582
I guess some
of their recent movies
went way over.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.502
I'm from finance.
Numbers are kinda my thing.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.338
Well, making movies
is kinda my thing.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.632
But you can't make movies
without money.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.468
-Come on, we can work together.
-Super.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.804
-Have you worked
on a lot of movies?
-This is my first.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.806
-Lucky me.
-Oh, wait.

09:58.889 --> 10:02.476
If I had some ideas
about the script? Do I talk
to you about those, or...

10:03.602 --> 10:05.062
Let's just put a pin in that.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.231
Where are you headed?

10:07.315 --> 10:10.276
Oh, I'm that grey
little number out--

10:16.532 --> 10:17.366
Uff.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.243
Excuse me.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.470
You okay?

10:39.388 --> 10:41.515
Okay, that my life just
got turned upside-down?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.977
No. I need a moment.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.563
It's gonna work out.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.566
Why are you smiling?

10:50.649 --> 10:53.903
-This is a Christmas movie.
-Yeah, that nobody cares about.

10:53.986 --> 10:58.324
Not the movie, this.
This whole thing
is a Christmas movie.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.410
What are you talking about?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.372
You're the lead, like Chloe,
trying to do this special
Christmas thing,

11:04.455 --> 11:07.625
and Christopher is Jeb,
the big city hotshot,
trying to shut you down.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.586
-I'm a big city hotshot, too.
-Not in this case.

11:10.669 --> 11:13.589
You're the small town girl
who knows what makes
Christmas special.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.925
I know how to make
Christmas movies special.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.427
Same thing.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.304
Well, big city hotshots
who don't know what
they're talking about

11:20.388 --> 11:22.056
are not limited to Christmas.

11:22.139 --> 11:23.724
-There's me too.
-You?

11:23.808 --> 11:26.102
Your plucky, young sidekick
trying to talk sense into you.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.561
Classic Christmas
movie character.

11:27.645 --> 11:29.814
Can I trade you in
for a talking dog?

11:29.897 --> 11:31.357
Not according to my contract.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.692
You're missing one thing.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.112
-What's that?
-It's July.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.031
You can't always contain
Christmas magic to December.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.141
Hey. Which way to set?

12:05.224 --> 12:06.976
-Up on the left.
-Thanks.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.578
So, now we have to make sure
this movie comes out perfect.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.039
So, I can get the network
to reconsider Christmas movies.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.499
Shouldn't be a problem.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.084
Did you say there's a problem?

12:32.168 --> 12:34.336
Oh, good. You're here.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.380
No. There's no problem.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.549
We have a problem.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.885
Ashley?

12:40.968 --> 12:43.345
-She doesn't wanna come to set.
-Of course, she won't.

12:44.722 --> 12:45.890
-I'll go talk to her.
-Yep.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.224
Yeah, we should go talk to her.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.692
So, how do you wanna play this?
Good cop, bad cop?

12:56.775 --> 12:58.277
No, I can handle this.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.534
Hey, Ashley, hon?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.995
You okay?

13:08.078 --> 13:10.623
Did you see what Michael posted
on Instagram?

13:11.957 --> 13:13.292
I did not.

13:13.375 --> 13:16.545
My co-star hates
working with me.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.589
Do you know
how many followers he has?

13:20.508 --> 13:24.428
-That's not nice.
-No, it's not, and he's a jerk.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.225
You know,
I think he was probably
just trying to be funny

13:29.308 --> 13:30.559
and generate some likes.

13:30.643 --> 13:35.231
At my expense?
I don't think so.

13:41.153 --> 13:44.406
-Just give her some time.
She'll come around.
-There is no time.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.617
Every day
is precisely planned out
from start to finish.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.745
Every 15 minutes that goes by
is a shot lost from the movie.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.080
Can't you just replace her?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.791
What are you talking about?

13:53.874 --> 13:56.252
Hey, if your portfolio
has a dud, you sell it,

13:56.335 --> 13:58.546
buy something new,
stay on top of the market.

13:58.629 --> 14:02.716
We would lose the entire day,
and we have to re-shoot
everything from yesterday.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.302
Besides,
I don't think she's a dud.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.596
-I think she's quite talented.
-Hmm.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.306
Okay.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.435
Do you mind if I? Thanks.

14:16.397 --> 14:20.651
Hey, Ashley. It's Christopher.
I'm the network executive
on the movie.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.784
Yeah?

14:28.867 --> 14:33.247
You know it's so great
to meet you. I loved your part
on<i> Euphoria.</i>

14:33.330 --> 14:37.084
-You saw that?
-My college roommate
actually wrote the episode.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.628
-He was lucky to have you.
-Really?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.672
Look,

14:41.755 --> 14:43.549
between you and me,

14:43.632 --> 14:45.843
you can act circles
around Michael.

14:45.926 --> 14:47.303
I can see why he's so jealous.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.308
-Do you think he is?
-It's kind of obvious,
isn't it?

14:54.768 --> 14:57.229
Don't let a fragile male ego

14:57.313 --> 15:00.524
rob you of another
incredible performance.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.151
You got this.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.987
Oh, my God. You're so right.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.531
Wow, it is so good
to connect with you.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.658
Pleasure's all mine.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.204
Okay. Um.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.339
I'm pretty good at this, huh?

15:26.342 --> 15:30.179
Oh, yeah,
flattering an actress.
You really cracked the code.

15:30.262 --> 15:34.933
Mmm-hmm. He's your antagonist,
but he's got a helpful side.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.102
-Checks that box.
-Not now, Reena.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.106
I'll be in the trailer
if you need me.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.030
Okay, everyone let's get ready
to shoot this.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.574
Okay,
we're second away, people.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.201
Just waiting on lighting.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.953
Where's the dog?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.039
He should be in the scene.
He's cute.

15:57.122 --> 16:01.835
He's a she. And she's expensive
to have around.
So, we use her sparingly.

16:01.919 --> 16:06.548
Oh, yeah, if she's expensive,
we should use her less.
Save the money.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.927
You know, this was
all planned out before you
and Theresa came around, right?

16:10.636 --> 16:11.804
Right, right.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.186
-Okay, stop. That's so hard.
-Okay. Ready, Jess.

16:19.269 --> 16:22.690
Okay, everyone, let's make
some Christmas magic.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.525
Quiet on set.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.069
-Roll sound.
-Speedy.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.405
-Roll camera.
-Rolling.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.531
Is this one for me?

16:38.956 --> 16:41.458
Scene 13. Take one. Mark.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.170
Okay, action.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.805
Coffee's here.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.015
Thanks.
Will you help me over here?

16:58.016 --> 17:00.102
Sure. What can I do?

17:00.185 --> 17:03.439
You know,
I'm really starting
to like this town.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.733
Oh, good. You're here.

17:07.025 --> 17:09.903
-Is something wrong, Chloe?
-Oh, Jeb.

17:09.987 --> 17:13.157
They're just not decorating
the tree the way
that they used to, and...

17:13.240 --> 17:16.618
The old way was perfect.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.997
-I think it looks very nice.
-Well, what do you know?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.793
Well, I know the bakery
isn't making enough dough.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.338
Get it? It's bakery... Dough.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.800
You're closing me down
and now you're making jokes?

17:31.884 --> 17:35.888
-Yeah, I'm sorry, I--
-It's not funny, because
that place is everything to me.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.141
-Yeah, I shouldn't have--
-You think you are
so much better than me.

17:39.224 --> 17:43.812
And that just because you're
a man, you can trash
my reputation?

17:43.896 --> 17:48.317
-Because I'm a man?
-I see you. I see you.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.236
And I know what you're doing,
so just back off!

17:57.826 --> 18:02.748
-Yo, Jess.
Are there new pages or--?
-Cut!

18:02.831 --> 18:04.917
That's a cut.
Background, back to one--

18:05.000 --> 18:07.711
This is so hot.
Can you just take this, please?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.924
Okay, okay, go, go.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.264
-Oh! I was just trying
something new.
-I saw.

18:19.348 --> 18:23.101
Okay, um,
are we allowed to improvise or?

18:23.185 --> 18:24.311
I'd prefer not.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.396
Oh, but I was
really feeling that.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.357
-I totally saw that.
-Yeah.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.859
But, you know, I just think
it's a little strong

18:30.943 --> 18:33.195
for where Chole is
at this point in the story.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.823
Mmm-mmm. No, no. Chloe needs
to stand up to Jeb.

18:35.906 --> 18:39.785
-Okay, my question is,
are we doing the scene--
-We're doing the scene. Yes.

18:39.868 --> 18:43.956
-As written. Okay?
-Yeah. That would be great.

18:44.039 --> 18:47.209
Michael?
Can you give us a moment?

18:48.627 --> 18:51.088
Female time... Yeah.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.424
Sure.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.970
I really like
what you're doing.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.055
-Okay. Thank you. Nice!

19:00.138 --> 19:04.977
But remember,
Chloe doesn't overpower Jeb
by arguing with him.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.564
-No?
-No, no.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.900
Chloe just has to stay true
to what she believes in.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.237
-Mmm.
-That's what inspires Jeb
to have a change of heart.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.826
-I think I get it, yeah.
-And, between you and me,

19:20.909 --> 19:24.496
Christopher was right.
You are acting circles
around him.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.125
I get it!

19:28.208 --> 19:30.085
-Let's try it again, yeah?
-Okay.

19:30.168 --> 19:31.545
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.629
Wardrobe.

19:33.755 --> 19:34.715
Last looks.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.734
-Why don't you
just go talk to him?
-This is better. Trust me.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.447
How long do we give him?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.991
As long as it, and he's doing
such amazing work.

20:01.074 --> 20:04.244
Oh, hey.
I was just talking about you.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.371
-Can I walk with you?
-Sure.

20:06.455 --> 20:10.542
So, I really love the tension
between your character,
Jeb, and Chloe.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.295
-I can really feel it.
-Yeah, it gets
pretty intense sometimes.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.799
-So I wonder if I can maybe
harness your superpowers here.
-Mine?

20:17.883 --> 20:21.762
-Yeah, you have such
a natural charm and magnetism.
-Right?

20:21.845 --> 20:25.933
I wonder if you could get
a little more friendly
with Ashley, off set.

20:26.016 --> 20:30.896
Maybe you can, I don't know,
bring another aspect
to her performance.

20:30.979 --> 20:34.358
Just make her feel like
you really see her, you know.

20:34.441 --> 20:38.153
-I think that will help us
in the later scenes.
-For you, anything.

20:38.236 --> 20:41.073
-Thank you, Michael.
-I got it, Jess.

20:41.156 --> 20:42.199
Can I give you these?

20:42.866 --> 20:43.909
Absolutely.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.838
Come in.

21:00.634 --> 21:04.513
Hey, there you are.
You kinda snuck out on me
back there.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.265
-Did I?
-You know,
I have learned so much.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.558
I'm so glad.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.230
Um...

21:13.313 --> 21:15.399
Do you wanna join me
for dinner?

21:15.482 --> 21:19.278
I would love to pick
your brain, get to know you
and this movie stuff better.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.824
I have a lot
to prepare for tomorrow.

21:23.907 --> 21:28.203
-But you gotta eat.
-Well, I have a bar.

21:28.286 --> 21:31.164
-Like, with scotch?
-No, a protein bar.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.875
Oh, well, that's not dinner.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.711
It is, tonight.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.301
-It's Reena, right?
-I'm not here.

21:43.385 --> 21:47.347
Reena, what would you say
is Jessica's biggest flaw?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.141
I would say
she doesn't have any.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.976
That's
a good answer.

21:51.059 --> 21:54.229
But, really. What would
bring her to the next level?

21:54.312 --> 21:56.857
I think she's doing great work.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.901
Yeah, her Christmas movie work,
sure. But...

22:01.361 --> 22:02.612
What's holding her back?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.245
Well, now I'm kinda
curious myself.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.751
Her perfectionism
gets in her way.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.586
-Boom.
-My what?

22:17.669 --> 22:20.172
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't be sorry.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.592
-I think we're on to something
here. I think--
-You know...

22:25.052 --> 22:26.511
Let's go get that dinner.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.431
-Great. Awesome.

22:29.514 --> 22:32.517
-I will meet you on
the soundstage in ten.
-And then?

22:33.852 --> 22:35.645
And then,
I'll take care of the rest.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.945
-My perfectionism
gets in the way?
-That's all I could think of.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.199
Why not just tell him I still
wet my bed? It would be
less embarrassing.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.575
You still wet the bed?

22:49.284 --> 22:50.452
No, Reena.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.329
Right.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.582
Now I have to get dinner
with him.

22:56.875 --> 22:59.044
Right on schedule.

22:59.127 --> 23:00.295
I'm sorry?

23:00.378 --> 23:02.422
For the Christmas story
of all this.

23:02.506 --> 23:05.258
You two get to know each other.
You see a side of him
you hadn't before.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.303
He finds a new appreciation
for what you do.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.473
What if I murder him at dinner?
Is that part of your
Christmas movie?

23:11.556 --> 23:14.684
Then you'd be making one
of the network's thrillers.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.394
That I could
probably live with.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.158
Christopher?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.743
Yeah.
I'm right back here.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.541
Honestly, I did have to
put out a few fires.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.876
It's good I got here.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.212
We did lose a shot.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.257
No, we'll work it out.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.759
Oh, hey, Jessica's here.

23:49.177 --> 23:51.763
Yes. Yes, of course.

23:53.098 --> 23:53.932
Okay.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.726
Oh, say hi to Theresa.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.689
-Hi, Theresa.
-Did you hear her?

24:01.773 --> 24:03.525
Theresa says "hi."

24:03.608 --> 24:05.402
-Great.
-Okay.

24:05.485 --> 24:06.695
Okay, bye.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.866
We got the whole place
to ourselves.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.160
I didn't know this set
had a working kitchen.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.954
No, one of our other movies
was serving dinner, and,

24:16.037 --> 24:17.247
wait, no, they...

24:18.206 --> 24:20.709
They went into second meal.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.252
That's a thing, right?

24:22.335 --> 24:24.588
-Yes.
-Yes.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.174
-So, I grabbed these.
-Fancy.

24:30.010 --> 24:30.844
Not bad.

24:31.511 --> 24:32.596
Thank you.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.226
So, Ashley seems
to be doing better.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.061
She killed it today.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.063
Maybe Michael is the problem.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.232
Don't worry about Ashley
and Michael any more.

24:45.358 --> 24:46.860
Why not?

24:46.943 --> 24:50.030
It's the formula.
Boy meets girl.
They have conflict.

24:50.113 --> 24:54.993
Christmas magic brings
them together, makes them
fall hopelessly in love.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.203
Trust the formula.

24:59.873 --> 25:00.874
Oh.

25:00.957 --> 25:02.876
Oh, I got 'em.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.298
Thank you.

25:10.091 --> 25:13.178
-Hey, I liked
your ad lib today.
-Yeah. It got kind of hot.

25:13.261 --> 25:15.305
-Yeah, it definitely
got intense.
-Yes.

25:15.388 --> 25:18.225
-What are you, like, a Leo?
-Aries.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.644
I knew it.
You're total fire sign.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.604
-What are you?
-I'm a Libra.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.440
-Okay, that makes sense.
We're complete opposites.
-We're complimentary!

25:25.523 --> 25:30.070
-We're polarizing!
-We provide balance
for each other!

25:30.153 --> 25:31.863
-Oh.
-Yeah.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.282
It's, kind of, cold.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.381
-Here you go. Nice and warm.
-Thank you.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.640
Did you see my Insta post?

25:58.723 --> 26:02.060
-Yeah, yeah, I did!
-It was so funny, right?

26:03.979 --> 26:07.482
-Yes, it was so funny.

26:07.565 --> 26:09.150
-I know.
-Yes.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.902
Hey, do you wanna take
a selfie with me?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.613
Oh, yeah. Yes.

26:13.697 --> 26:14.906
What's your good side?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.783
-This one.
-I was gonna say that one.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.827
Really? Oh, thank you.

26:18.910 --> 26:20.120
Oh, my gosh, okay.

26:20.203 --> 26:23.123
-Let's break the Internet.
-Oh, please.

26:26.459 --> 26:31.715
-Rawr.
-Be a cat.

26:31.798 --> 26:36.011
So, when you say you come
from finance,
what is that exactly?

26:36.094 --> 26:40.015
Uh, mergers and acquisitions.
Venture capital.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.225
And who it is you do that for?

26:42.309 --> 26:44.436
Wherever my skills
have taken me.

26:44.519 --> 26:49.065
Wall Street, a couple
of start-ups, a hedge fund
out of Kansas City.

26:49.149 --> 26:51.359
From hedge funds to Hollywood?

26:51.443 --> 26:54.321
-That's a leap.
-Not really.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.156
Movies are crazy expensive.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.408
To be honest,

26:58.491 --> 27:00.368
I don't really know
where all the money goes.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.828
We do have a budget.

27:01.911 --> 27:05.623
Yeah, I was looking at that.
It is very complex.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.709
I mean, there's
so many line items, but,

27:08.626 --> 27:10.003
I'll figure it out.

27:10.086 --> 27:13.381
But what made you choose movies
as your next job?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.759
Oh, I went to
the same prep school as Carl.

27:15.842 --> 27:16.843
You know Carl?

27:18.094 --> 27:19.012
Lomax?

27:20.263 --> 27:24.225
-The CEO of our network?
-Yeah, he's a great guy.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.061
He thought I'd be a good fit
for the new team.

27:26.144 --> 27:29.064
-So now you just suddenly work
at a major network?
-Yeah.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.942
What Ivy League school
did you go to?

27:34.194 --> 27:35.695
-What makes you think I--
-Which one?

27:37.614 --> 27:40.075
-Princeton.
-Couldn't get into Harvard?

27:40.158 --> 27:41.910
I did. I chose Princeton.

27:41.993 --> 27:47.082
Yeah, okay. You don't live
in the same world
as us regular folk.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.919
The world just rises up
and gifts you a place in it.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.254
For the rest of us,
we have to carve out a place.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.425
We have to plant our flag
and defend our land.

27:57.509 --> 28:00.011
And your land
is Cupcake Christmas?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.471
My land is...

28:01.554 --> 28:04.516
warm, comforting,
predictable entertainment.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.977
Why did you pick
Christmas movies?

28:24.035 --> 28:25.703
This lady.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.498
We always spent Christmas
at my Grandma Pearl's.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.334
And every year, she and I
would snuggle up on the couch.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.586
And binge watch
Christmas movies together.

28:35.171 --> 28:38.341
I'm sure I've seen at least
a hundred of them in my life.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.595
It's what made me
want to get into filmmaking.

28:45.890 --> 28:49.477
Wait. Not<i> The Godfather?</i>
Or<i> Citizen Kane?</i>

28:49.561 --> 28:53.314
-Oh, no. Too complex.
Too many layers.
-Ah.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.817
I do this because I chose it.

28:55.900 --> 29:00.655
Not just because it was
my next stop on "wherever
my skills will take me."

29:05.577 --> 29:08.496
I binged watched all
of your six Christmas movies.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.458
-Starting with the first:
<i>Perfectly Christmas.</i>

29:12.333 --> 29:14.169
Yep.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.880
That movie put me
on the Christmas map.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.050
Wow. We basically had no money.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.471
I made so many mistakes.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.056
But people loved it.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.229
They did.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.066
How are we supposed
to be able to quantify that?

29:37.150 --> 29:40.904
It's not an equation,
Princeton. It's an art form.

29:40.987 --> 29:43.781
-Ooh. That was deep.

29:52.790 --> 29:53.625
For you.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.755
Where did you guys eat?
In an airplane?

30:02.842 --> 30:05.345
And, how did it go?

30:05.428 --> 30:06.971
It was good. Fine.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.936
So that's all
you're going to say?
Did you guys hit it off?

30:13.019 --> 30:15.104
Well, we're
very different people.

30:15.188 --> 30:18.191
-How so?
-Well, for one thing,
he's a Princeton grad.

30:18.274 --> 30:20.068
-A what?
-A Princeton--

30:20.151 --> 30:21.069
-A what?
-A Prince--

30:21.152 --> 30:22.654
A Prince?

30:22.737 --> 30:25.949
-...ton grad.
-Big city hotshot
is secretly a Prince?

30:26.032 --> 30:28.785
It's a Christmas movie
double whammy!

30:28.868 --> 30:29.994
That is a stretch.

30:31.287 --> 30:32.956
You can't write this stuff!

30:33.039 --> 30:36.459
Eventually, someone will.
Reena, can we get back
to work, please?

30:56.020 --> 30:57.897
Let's go a little lighter.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.942
Do you wanna do
a 24 or 35?

31:01.025 --> 31:02.860
-Thirty-five.
-Okay, I'm on it.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.154
Let's get the dog in.

31:08.366 --> 31:09.867
We have a problem.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.579
So, she was
in there with you...

31:12.662 --> 31:16.207
I put her wardrobe on,
you know, like I usually do.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.167
She was definitely fussy.

31:18.251 --> 31:21.629
I was getting these vibes
from her, like, I've never
gotten before, you know.

31:21.713 --> 31:25.758
-Maybe it was the vegan kibble
I gave her--
-And then?

31:25.842 --> 31:30.138
Well, and then, I went to grab
her treats for the next scene,

31:30.221 --> 31:32.724
and I turned around,
and she was gone.

31:32.807 --> 31:35.476
-She was gone!
-Okay, well, she can't get off
the lot, so--

31:35.560 --> 31:37.520
Wait. You think
she got off the lot?

31:37.604 --> 31:40.773
No, no, no. No one's going
to let a dog dressed like
an elf off a studio lot.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.818
-We need to start shooting,
Jessica.
-We gotta find Zooey first.

31:43.901 --> 31:45.570
-Yes, we have to find Zooey.
-Yes.

31:45.653 --> 31:48.531
Zooey! Zooey, come to me!

31:51.075 --> 31:52.869
It's a dog dressed
like an elf, people.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.495
Shouldn't be too hard to spot.

31:54.579 --> 31:58.499
Everyone, fan out and keep
your walkies on Channel one.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.252
This shouldn't take too long.
I hope not.

32:02.086 --> 32:03.129
Let's do it.

32:04.505 --> 32:06.090
Let's go check
with other productions.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.634
Oh, good idea.

32:08.217 --> 32:09.135
Yes? No?

32:10.595 --> 32:13.556
Okay, thank you. Uh, well...

32:13.640 --> 32:16.017
But if you do see her,
this is my cell.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.728
Okay.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.030
Do you think
maybe you're a jinx?

32:29.947 --> 32:31.658
In what way?

32:31.741 --> 32:33.701
Well, everything
that can go wrong on this movie
is going wrong,

32:33.785 --> 32:36.120
and you're always
around for it.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.373
Hmm. That's interesting.

32:38.456 --> 32:41.584
Or, these things are going
to go wrong anyway,

32:41.668 --> 32:45.546
and it's great that I'm here
for it. Think about that.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.048
Hey, excuse me. Have you...

32:48.966 --> 32:49.926
seen a dog?

32:51.052 --> 32:52.261
I'm sorry, no.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.639
This isn't gonna work.

32:54.722 --> 32:57.558
Wait, wait, wait.
<i>Grease</i> meets<i> The Walking Dead?</i>

32:57.642 --> 32:59.560
Are you kidding me?

32:59.644 --> 33:02.772
Why didn't I think of that?
Oh, I've an idea.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.960
-Well?
-Okay.

33:24.043 --> 33:27.672
-This is a dog call my dad used
to use on his fox hunts.
-Oh, stop.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.049
Let me try it. It might work.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.614
I guess Zooey isn't
a descendent
of British royalty.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.824
Maybe I didn't do it right.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.994
Hold on. Let's try this.

33:58.077 --> 34:01.414
-We can spread it far and wide.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.915
Hit it, Prince Harry.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.270
Sorry, your highness.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.022
It wasn't a terrible idea.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.524
<i> We got the dog!</i>

34:32.904 --> 34:35.281
Okay, everyone, back to set.

34:37.950 --> 34:39.827
I think
a thank you is in order.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.996
Why?
The walkie was my idea.

34:42.079 --> 34:44.332
Yeah, but the whistle was mine.
It wouldn't have worked
without the whistle.

34:44.415 --> 34:48.252
Yeah, well.
The whistle wouldn't have
worked without the walkie...

34:52.131 --> 34:55.551
-I drink away too much coffee.
-You look really good.

34:58.096 --> 35:02.850
-Oh, my goodness.
-Look at your little hat.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.685
All right, everyone.
Let's get ready to shoot.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.146
-Do we look cute together?
-You do.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.148
You guys all set?

35:09.232 --> 35:10.858
-Yo, Jess, can you take a photo
of us, please, real quick?
-Please.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.194
-You're killing me.
-Here.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.989
Hey, when my four million
followers watch this movie,
you're gonna thank me.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.700
-You're gonna
thank him.
-I got it. You go.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.410
Hey. Okay.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.079
Count to three. One...

35:23.162 --> 35:24.872
She's blocking my face.
Hang on.
She's blocking my face.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.040
All right. Okay.

35:26.123 --> 35:28.960
One, two, three.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.212
-You guys look so beautiful.
-Oh, yeah.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.006
-Okay.
-All right, everyone.
Quiet on set.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.717
-Say, "That's my Mommy
and Daddy."

35:42.765 --> 35:45.101
How'd you know
that dog whistle thing?

35:45.184 --> 35:47.895
I didn't. Christopher did.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.482
-Mmm-hmm. Team work...
-Don't.

35:51.566 --> 35:54.193
I will be in the trailer
if you need me.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.278
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.740
Wow.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.536
-Making movies is exciting.
-If you mean stressful,
then, yes, I agree.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.913
You know, it's really neat
the way everyone got
on board to help.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.082
It's their job.

36:08.165 --> 36:10.084
Okay, everyone,
quiet on set.

36:10.167 --> 36:12.044
It's nothing like the world
that I come from.

36:13.963 --> 36:14.922
This is cool.

36:19.719 --> 36:20.636
Time to work.

36:21.679 --> 36:22.597
Let's lock it up.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.558
Roll sound!

36:25.641 --> 36:27.810
-Roll camera!
-Rolling...

36:29.312 --> 36:31.772
-Scene 28.
Take one. Mark.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.483
And... action.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.154
Sprinkles, or no sprinkles?

36:38.237 --> 36:40.323
That's what
I was thinking.

36:44.577 --> 36:46.370
And let's remember
to check on the band

36:46.454 --> 36:47.955
for the Christmas
Celebration scene.

36:48.039 --> 36:48.873
On it.

36:55.212 --> 36:56.130
Hey, Jess.

36:57.506 --> 37:00.009
Can I give you
a lift to your trailer?

37:00.092 --> 37:02.470
No, it's right over there.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.306
Come on. Hop in.

37:07.391 --> 37:10.394
Time for a sleigh ride. Check.

37:18.694 --> 37:19.987
Where to, milord?

37:20.071 --> 37:22.990
Once around ye olde studio lot,
my lad.

37:23.741 --> 37:24.659
Giddy up!

37:44.136 --> 37:45.721
What have you done?

37:45.805 --> 37:47.682
I am embracing
the Christmas movie.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.684
Just had to deck out
the transport.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.978
This is a lovely
golf-cart sleigh, Christopher,

37:52.061 --> 37:54.647
but this is not what makes
a Christmas movie.

37:54.730 --> 37:57.441
-Why not?
-Because all the things
in Christmas movies,

37:57.525 --> 38:00.945
the sleigh rides, the caroling,
the tree lighting,

38:01.028 --> 38:03.489
it's just the window dressing.

38:03.572 --> 38:07.284
If that's all it took,
then<i> Die Hard</i> would be
a Christmas movie.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.453
That is literally
the best Christmas movie.

38:11.664 --> 38:16.877
Okay, well, the heart
of my Christmas movies
is the love story.

38:16.961 --> 38:21.257
It's finding true love
through the magic
of the Christmas season.

38:21.340 --> 38:23.968
You're saying
I spent all this money
on holly for nothing?

38:24.051 --> 38:26.262
It's not holly.
It's mistletoe.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.476
-Maybe I should have done
a little more research.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.939
-Whoa!

38:45.823 --> 38:47.783
I can walk from here.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.995
Wait, I have an idea
for Chloe's Cupcakes.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.288
Okay.

38:52.371 --> 38:53.998
Okay, so, right now,
the bakery gets saved

38:54.081 --> 38:57.001
because love
is the main ingredient
in the cupcakes.

38:57.084 --> 39:00.046
-Did I read that right?
-You did.
It's part of the magic.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.965
Okay, well,
I was just thinking,
what if, to save the bakery,

39:03.049 --> 39:05.509
Chloe does
something more active?

39:05.593 --> 39:08.012
-Like what?
-Like she creates
something new,

39:08.095 --> 39:09.930
and then it gets more attention
for the bakery.

39:12.308 --> 39:15.186
It just feels a little outside
of the formula.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.106
Oh, okay.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.567
Uh... Will you think about it?

39:21.650 --> 39:22.651
Yeah, I will.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.993
-And thanks
for the sleigh ride.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.121
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:34.914 --> 39:35.790
See you tomorrow.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.543
Yippee-ki-ay!

40:11.742 --> 40:13.661
Did you get
my script changes?

40:13.744 --> 40:15.788
Yep, props will have them ready
for this afternoon.
Not a problem.

40:15.871 --> 40:17.706
Okay, great.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.667
-We've got a problem.
-What is it?

40:19.750 --> 40:22.711
-Someone changed the cupcakes
from the bakery scene.
-I did that.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.713
You shouldn't mess
with the Christmas formula.

40:24.797 --> 40:26.423
It was a note from the network.

40:28.342 --> 40:29.885
Have you seen Christopher?

40:29.969 --> 40:32.555
He's not here. Do you want me
to get a hold of him?

40:32.638 --> 40:34.765
No. I can text him.

40:44.608 --> 40:46.026
Let's do it, Daniel.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.820
-Picture's up.
-Picture's up.

40:47.903 --> 40:49.697
Background,
to first positions.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.740
Okay, everyone, quiet on set.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.492
Let's get ready to shoot.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.913
Roll sound.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.123
Roll camera.

41:01.876 --> 41:02.710
Rolling.

41:07.882 --> 41:10.217
Scene 31. Take one. Mark.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.139
And...

41:16.265 --> 41:17.183
action.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.696
Yeah, the tree looks great.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.907
Um. Yeah, it does.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.951
You were right
about the ornament.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.537
Just because something
is different doesn't mean
it's bad.

41:41.498 --> 41:43.292
And what did you hang there?

41:44.293 --> 41:45.711
That's my mom.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.880
She started Chloe's Cakes
20 years ago.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.591
And now I'm shutting it down.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.635
Yeah.

41:56.263 --> 42:00.017
What if you create something
new to get your bakery
more attention?

42:02.186 --> 42:03.604
Hadn't really thought
about that.

42:05.731 --> 42:09.235
Yeah... I wonder if, um,

42:09.318 --> 42:12.571
I helped out, we could think
of something together.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.450
You'd help me save my bakery?

42:19.286 --> 42:20.913
I feel like I would...

42:20.996 --> 42:23.916
do almost anything
to help you out, Ms. Donner.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.131
There you are!

42:31.215 --> 42:33.342
I've been looking
all over this crappy
little town for you!

42:33.425 --> 42:35.928
Nadia, what are you doing here?

42:36.011 --> 42:39.640
What? I can't surprise
my fiancé as an early
Christmas present?

42:40.557 --> 42:41.475
Fiancé?

42:45.562 --> 42:48.232
Uh... Yeah.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.618
Uh, sorry.
Do you want us to cut, or...

42:59.702 --> 43:01.495
Are we, like, walking?
What are you...

43:02.871 --> 43:06.041
Oh, cut. Yeah, cut!
That's a cut!

43:06.917 --> 43:07.751
Cutting.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.132
-You okay?
-Yeah.

43:13.215 --> 43:16.135
-That was so awkward.
-Yeah.

43:16.218 --> 43:17.344
You guys can stop hugging now.

43:17.428 --> 43:20.973
-Uh... Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

43:21.056 --> 43:23.142
Hey, yeah,
you guys are killing it.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.852
Um, it's just a...

43:24.935 --> 43:26.854
You know,
it's just the lighting issue
we're trying to work out.

43:26.937 --> 43:29.398
But you keep doing
what you're doing.

43:29.481 --> 43:31.734
-That's good, right?
-Yeah, really good.

43:31.817 --> 43:36.363
Jess, Jess, Jess.
Uh, so I just have
a quick question.

43:36.447 --> 43:38.532
When I hang the ornament
on the tree,

43:39.700 --> 43:41.076
do you want me to cry a little?

43:42.578 --> 43:44.538
Do you want to cry a little?

43:44.621 --> 43:46.040
I can cry a little.

43:46.123 --> 43:48.292
I can do it whenever I want,
I can cry on command.

43:49.918 --> 43:53.922
-Well, let's try it.
It could be nice.
-Okay.

43:54.882 --> 43:56.967
Okay.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.972
-Okay, everyone, let's reset.
-Yeah

44:02.056 --> 44:04.266
-Let's try it again.
-What is she doing?

44:08.687 --> 44:10.314
-You okay?
-Yeah.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.985
All right, back to one,
everyone.

44:17.154 --> 44:18.364
Roll sound.

44:19.448 --> 44:20.491
Roll camera.

44:21.116 --> 44:21.950
Rolling.

44:32.211 --> 44:34.838
Are you going to lunch
or do you want me
to grab you something?

44:35.964 --> 44:37.716
Still no word from Christopher.

44:38.926 --> 44:39.885
Sorry.

44:41.762 --> 44:43.931
Hey, Jessica.
There's someone
here to see you.

44:44.014 --> 44:46.058
She's over on the office set.

44:47.434 --> 44:48.394
The office set?

45:23.721 --> 45:27.224
I'll just take this out
of your way. It's gotta
be dry by now.

45:28.892 --> 45:31.812
-Jessica, hi.
-Yes.

45:31.895 --> 45:35.566
I'm Theresa Frost.
I'm the New Network president.

45:35.649 --> 45:38.152
-Great to finally meet you.
-You too.

45:38.235 --> 45:41.071
We're really getting
a lot of attention
from you guys lately.

45:41.155 --> 45:45.951
Yes, we've been in such
a twister with this whole
Christmas movie thing.

45:47.327 --> 45:49.663
Well... This thing?

45:49.746 --> 45:52.374
We're going to dial back
your budget to completion.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.126
In the middle of production?

45:54.209 --> 45:57.004
Oh, you have no idea
the over-spending
that we inherited.

45:57.087 --> 45:59.173
We're tightening the belt
across the board.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.049
Wow. Okay.

46:02.926 --> 46:07.181
-Does Christopher know
about this?
-Um, it was his idea.

46:07.264 --> 46:08.891
So, clearly.

46:10.517 --> 46:11.810
I'm sure he told you
that we're shutting down

46:11.894 --> 46:13.187
the whole
Christmas Movie division.

46:14.021 --> 46:14.855
Oh...

46:15.731 --> 46:18.192
He did. Yeah.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.236
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.198
There's just...

46:24.281 --> 46:26.825
so much better content
available out there.

46:26.909 --> 46:30.078
Right? I mean, no offense.
You know what I mean.

46:30.162 --> 46:33.832
Anyway, I will leave you to it.
It was so nice
to meet you though.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.751
-So vibrant.
-Thanks.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.394
Christopher knew about this?

46:55.854 --> 46:57.064
Something's not right.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.857
Theresa shouldn't
be cutting your budget.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.692
She should be the girlfriend
that's wrong for Christopher.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.072
I'm texting Christopher.

47:05.155 --> 47:07.616
This is because you changed
the script! It's spilling over
into your story line.

47:07.699 --> 47:09.243
I don't have a story line,
Reena!

47:09.326 --> 47:12.079
This is my life,
and it's falling apart!

47:23.006 --> 47:23.966
I got it.

47:38.021 --> 47:40.148
You better have a real good
explanation for this.

47:56.915 --> 47:57.875
What did he say?

48:02.254 --> 48:03.880
I'm not dealing
with this right now.

48:06.425 --> 48:08.844
Ugh. Is this how he's climbed
the corporate ladder?

48:13.974 --> 48:15.809
He has a girlfriend.
Did you know
he had a girlfriend?

48:15.892 --> 48:19.146
-No, I just found out
she is his wife.
-No! He said girlfriend.

48:19.229 --> 48:22.441
-Christopher told you
he has a girlfriend?
-Who is Christopher?

48:22.524 --> 48:26.695
-Who are you talking about?
-Stupid sexy Michael!

48:26.778 --> 48:28.530
-Michael has a girlfriend?
-Yes!

48:28.614 --> 48:31.491
-And that's made you
this mad because...

48:31.575 --> 48:33.160
You slept together?

48:33.243 --> 48:35.787
Yeah. You told me
to make her feel
like I see her.

48:35.871 --> 48:38.165
-By complimenting her.
-I did.

48:38.248 --> 48:39.708
Well, it worked too well!

48:39.791 --> 48:42.127
I feel like it kind of worked
just the right amount.

48:42.210 --> 48:43.837
She said you have a girlfriend.

48:43.920 --> 48:45.839
Yeah, I do,
but she's an actor, too.

48:45.922 --> 48:49.259
And, she and I have this deal
that sho-mances don't count
as cheating.

48:50.761 --> 48:54.222
So, your girlfriend
is fine with it?

48:54.306 --> 48:55.724
Yeah, it was her idea!

48:56.475 --> 48:57.351
Okay.

48:58.268 --> 49:00.103
Well...

49:00.187 --> 49:02.814
Did you ever think that Ashley
might not be fine with
being a sho-mance?

49:05.359 --> 49:07.361
I mean, we didn't discuss it.

49:09.696 --> 49:12.115
Well, you might have a girl
who's falling for you here.

49:14.242 --> 49:15.702
Hmm.

49:16.995 --> 49:19.081
Oh, boy.

49:19.998 --> 49:20.874
Michael,

49:21.958 --> 49:23.377
listen to me, uh...

49:26.129 --> 49:29.049
You can't play games
with people's hearts.

49:29.132 --> 49:33.428
And you can't predict when
and where someone might find
a true love story.

49:33.512 --> 49:35.555
Even on a movie set,
it happens.

49:39.685 --> 49:40.977
Okay, I'll talk to her.

49:42.312 --> 49:43.522
Thank you.

49:53.824 --> 49:54.700
Daniel.

49:55.909 --> 49:59.913
Sorry...
It just helps me relax.

49:59.996 --> 50:01.373
Have you seen
the new budget numbers?

50:01.456 --> 50:02.916
I've heard some things.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.001
Mmm-hmm. What? We're gonna have
to make some cuts--

50:05.085 --> 50:07.129
No. I'm not
compromising one frame.
I need to talk to Christopher.

50:07.212 --> 50:09.089
-Okay, but we
should start thinking--
-I will handle this.

50:09.172 --> 50:11.842
-We should start thinking
about it now.
-I will handle this!

50:16.430 --> 50:19.433
-What the--

50:21.393 --> 50:23.061
Did Zooey come by here?

50:23.145 --> 50:25.105
-That way.
-Oh!

50:25.188 --> 50:26.732
Do you need some help?

50:26.815 --> 50:28.066
No, I got her!

50:30.861 --> 50:32.112
-Jess.
-Yeah.

50:32.195 --> 50:33.780
Christopher has
been looking for you.

50:33.864 --> 50:36.992
-And...?
-And he's here. In our trailer.

50:59.097 --> 51:00.265
What just happened to me?

51:01.016 --> 51:01.933
I'm so sorry.

51:02.017 --> 51:03.643
Was this the plan all along?

51:03.727 --> 51:05.562
Just pretend you care and then
pull the rug out from under us?

51:06.396 --> 51:07.647
I do care.

51:07.731 --> 51:08.899
Is that why you suggested
cutting our budget?

51:10.150 --> 51:12.068
-Is that what Theresa said?
-Yes.

51:12.152 --> 51:15.864
Did she also say that they
were gonna stop production
all together?

51:15.947 --> 51:18.867
Jessica, today I was told
to shut you down.

51:20.285 --> 51:21.328
Shut us down?

51:25.165 --> 51:27.417
It's my fault.

51:27.501 --> 51:32.214
I didn't understand
some of the finishing cost
in the budget,

51:32.297 --> 51:35.008
I didn't realize we needed
that much money

51:35.091 --> 51:36.343
for the completion of the film.

51:36.426 --> 51:37.844
You're supposed to
be the numbers guy.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.513
I know, I know.

51:39.596 --> 51:42.516
And I'm so sorry.

51:42.599 --> 51:46.061
But when Theresa saw
the correct amount,
she freaked.

51:46.144 --> 51:49.272
I had to convince her
we could still finish but...

51:50.106 --> 51:52.150
with what we have left.

51:52.234 --> 51:54.486
It can't get finished
for less, Christopher!

51:54.569 --> 51:56.029
Our budget was perfect!

51:57.364 --> 51:58.573
Well, now you
have a new budget.

52:00.325 --> 52:02.869
So... Okay. So what?

52:02.953 --> 52:04.663
It's either this or nothing?

52:15.298 --> 52:17.425
<i> Okay, everybody,</i>
<i>we're back from lunch.</i>

52:19.803 --> 52:21.012
I'm gonna finish my damn movie.

52:28.562 --> 52:29.437
Excuse me.

52:46.663 --> 52:47.539
Hey...

52:52.252 --> 52:55.255
Daniel, did we change
the cupcakes to keto cupcakes?

52:55.338 --> 52:57.299
Loading them up now.

52:57.382 --> 53:00.552
It's not too late
to change them back
to cupcakes made with love.

53:01.803 --> 53:03.597
Just get everyone ready
to shoot.

53:03.680 --> 53:06.850
Pictures up.
Whitney, keto cupcakes?

53:06.933 --> 53:07.851
seconds away.

53:15.358 --> 53:16.443
Keto cupcakes.

53:17.235 --> 53:18.737
I like it.

53:18.820 --> 53:21.323
-Was that the surprise
you texted me about?
-Get out.

53:22.699 --> 53:26.286
-What?
-Go on.
This is now a closed set.

53:30.206 --> 53:31.166
Reena?

53:31.833 --> 53:33.501
Yes?

53:33.585 --> 53:34.878
Can you please escort
our network executive
off of the set?

53:36.421 --> 53:37.547
Me?

53:37.631 --> 53:38.798
We are on a very tight budget

53:38.882 --> 53:40.759
and I can't afford
any distractions.

53:45.221 --> 53:46.556
Fine.

53:46.640 --> 53:48.141
I'll go.

53:48.224 --> 53:50.393
I'm just relieved that
this is still happening.

53:51.561 --> 53:52.646
Clock's ticking.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.191
Good luck.

53:56.274 --> 53:58.193
We say "break a leg"
in this business.

54:03.823 --> 54:05.158
Daniel,

54:05.241 --> 54:06.576
is the dog here yet?

54:06.660 --> 54:07.577
Flying in.

54:08.912 --> 54:10.080
Big gesture.

54:11.498 --> 54:12.582
What's that?

54:12.666 --> 54:14.417
That's how you get
her past this.

54:15.251 --> 54:16.753
-I do?
-Yes.

54:16.836 --> 54:19.506
Big city hotshot screws up,
but then makes a big gesture

54:19.589 --> 54:20.924
because he has
come to appreciate

54:21.007 --> 54:22.592
what the small town girl
believes in.

54:22.676 --> 54:26.179
I tried. What else
am I supposed to do?

54:26.262 --> 54:27.514
You'll figure it out.

54:27.597 --> 54:28.890
We're here!

54:28.974 --> 54:30.558
We're here! Zooey's here!

54:30.642 --> 54:32.102
I got her! She's fine!

54:32.185 --> 54:35.814
She's absolutely fine!
She is fine! Zooey flying in.

54:37.607 --> 54:38.525
Excuse me.

54:47.283 --> 54:48.702
I think that's everyone.

54:48.785 --> 54:50.495
Do you want
to roll sound on this?

54:50.578 --> 54:52.956
Not on this.
It's for the montage.

54:53.039 --> 54:55.542
Okay, sound stand down.

54:55.625 --> 54:57.752
Everyone else, let's do this.

54:58.920 --> 55:00.130
Quiet on set.

55:01.089 --> 55:02.549
Roll camera.

55:02.632 --> 55:04.676
-Rolling.
-Stop the MOS.

55:12.308 --> 55:13.184
And...

55:14.477 --> 55:15.353
action.

57:17.600 --> 57:18.643
Okay, cut!

57:36.619 --> 57:37.829
All of this and rain?

57:38.746 --> 57:40.039
We made it to the last day.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.376
What time tomorrow?

57:43.459 --> 57:44.794
1:00 p.m. crew call.

57:47.213 --> 57:48.840
How many townspeople
do we have?

57:51.050 --> 57:51.885
None.

57:52.635 --> 57:54.095
What?

57:54.179 --> 57:55.763
I told you we're gonna have
to make cuts along the way,

57:55.847 --> 57:57.015
and you didn't want to,

57:57.098 --> 57:58.474
so now we have
no money for extras.

58:00.143 --> 58:03.062
A town-wide celebration
with no townspeople?

58:04.647 --> 58:06.107
We have a Santa.

58:06.191 --> 58:09.777
-How many kids
to meet Santa?
-Oh, God, no.

58:09.861 --> 58:12.947
-You know how much onset
teachers cost.
-How about a band?

58:13.031 --> 58:14.908
-No.
-A singer?

58:14.991 --> 58:16.117
No, nothing.

58:19.495 --> 58:22.999
Christmas Celebration has
to be big and magical.

58:23.082 --> 58:25.877
It's where the lovers kiss
for the first time!

58:33.760 --> 58:34.928
It's Christopher.

58:36.512 --> 58:39.724
He says he has an idea
for the Christmas Celebration.

58:39.807 --> 58:41.935
-Oh, that's a good timing.
-Call him.

58:42.018 --> 58:45.396
-No, we don't need him.
-It wouldn't hurt
to talk to him.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.608
-He's still around.
-What? Where?

59:10.838 --> 59:11.798
Oh, boy.

59:13.132 --> 59:14.968
-Hi.
-What are you doing here?

59:15.051 --> 59:17.804
You never said
I couldn't be involved,
just not on the set, so...

59:17.887 --> 59:19.597
Brett's been letting me
watch the dailies.

59:23.685 --> 59:25.853
About the
Christmas Celebration,
I have some really--

59:25.937 --> 59:28.523
Don't you think you've
caused enough problems?

59:28.606 --> 59:30.358
Hear me out.

59:30.441 --> 59:32.360
Uh, my nephew
is in a summer theatre program
at his high school.

59:32.443 --> 59:33.820
It is 15 kids.

59:33.903 --> 59:35.780
They could be in the movie
for work-study credits.

59:35.863 --> 59:37.740
We don't even have to pay them.

59:37.824 --> 59:39.659
Fifteen high school kids?

59:39.742 --> 59:41.828
That's not a town-wide
celebration, that's a tenth
of a senior prom.

59:41.911 --> 59:43.997
We can throw big hats and coats
on them.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.540
We need bodies,
that's what matters most.

59:45.623 --> 59:48.167
We already had
the perfect background actors.

59:48.251 --> 59:49.419
Well, now we don't.

59:49.502 --> 59:51.170
I also go
to First Presbyterian Church,

59:51.254 --> 59:54.757
and they have a 25-member choir
plus musical accompaniment.

59:54.841 --> 59:57.010
I made a deal with the pastor
that they could be in the movie

59:57.093 --> 59:58.720
as part of a community
outreach event,

59:58.803 --> 1:00:00.555
so, we don't have
to pay them either.

1:00:00.638 --> 1:00:02.223
Amateur musicians, great.

1:00:02.307 --> 1:00:04.809
-What is going on with you?
-We're just plugging holes.

1:00:04.892 --> 1:00:07.687
What other options
do we have right now?

1:00:07.770 --> 1:00:10.023
Christopher,
these are great ideas.

1:00:10.106 --> 1:00:12.191
Do you have time to draw up
the paperwork with me?

1:00:19.032 --> 1:00:20.450
Only if it's okay with Jessica.

1:00:26.914 --> 1:00:29.208
Everything doesn't
have to be perfect.

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:39.218
Fine.

1:00:40.094 --> 1:00:43.556
Okay, good.

1:00:43.639 --> 1:00:45.725
Let's just spend
the final day herding cats.

1:00:46.476 --> 1:00:47.643
Make it happen.

1:01:58.714 --> 1:02:01.050
Well, that was it.

1:02:01.884 --> 1:02:03.302
This is our last day.

1:02:03.386 --> 1:02:06.055
The bakery
is officially closed.

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:11.602
The Christmas Celebration?

1:02:11.686 --> 1:02:13.729
I'm not really in the mood
for celebrating.

1:02:15.148 --> 1:02:17.150
I don't care that Jeb's going
to be there.

1:02:17.233 --> 1:02:19.068
I never want
to see his face ever again.

1:02:28.911 --> 1:02:30.288
Christmas is ruined.

1:02:32.498 --> 1:02:34.584
Okay, cut!

1:02:34.667 --> 1:02:37.336
-That was good.
-That was great.

1:02:38.713 --> 1:02:40.256
-Good shot.
-Good?

1:02:40.339 --> 1:02:42.008
We got it. Moving on.

1:02:42.091 --> 1:02:44.886
All right,
that's lunch everyone.

1:02:44.969 --> 1:02:48.973
Next scene is
at the Town Square
for the Christmas Celebration.

1:02:52.059 --> 1:02:54.228
I don't ever wanna see
your face again.

1:02:54.312 --> 1:02:56.564
-Look, I just wanna show
you something.
-What?

1:02:56.647 --> 1:02:58.816
-Look.
-Oh, God.

1:02:58.900 --> 1:03:01.110
-What filter is that?
Clarendon?
-Yeah.

1:03:01.194 --> 1:03:04.280
-Could you be any more basic?
-Hey, look at the likes.

1:03:05.990 --> 1:03:07.909
Notice
anything different?

1:03:10.953 --> 1:03:14.874
I have 400,000 new followers.
I have 400,000 new followers.

1:03:14.957 --> 1:03:17.251
She's got 400,000
new followers.

1:03:17.335 --> 1:03:19.212
-Okay, uh...
-We broke the Internet.

1:03:19.295 --> 1:03:23.049
Let's go take photos wearing
each other's wardrobe.

1:03:23.132 --> 1:03:24.425
-It's brilliant.
-Let's go.

1:03:24.509 --> 1:03:26.469
I'm obsessed.

1:03:26.552 --> 1:03:28.763
Well, thank you
for letting us know.

1:03:35.770 --> 1:03:36.896
We have a problem.

1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:43.236
The paperwork didn't go through
for the church

1:03:43.319 --> 1:03:45.613
to be able to participate as
community outreach.

1:03:45.696 --> 1:03:46.906
So, now we have...

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:49.283
no choir
or musical accompaniment.

1:03:50.743 --> 1:03:51.577
Oh, no.

1:03:55.957 --> 1:03:58.668
-Um...

1:03:58.751 --> 1:04:03.297
Maybe the theatre kids
will be enough.

1:04:03.381 --> 1:04:06.759
15 teenagers
representing an entire town?

1:04:06.842 --> 1:04:08.678
Well, we can,
we can...

1:04:08.761 --> 1:04:12.557
We can reuse them.
We can stack 'em, shoot 'em,
move 'em around.

1:04:14.350 --> 1:04:17.436
So now we have to lose
the musical part of the scene.

1:04:19.814 --> 1:04:21.649
I think so.

1:04:21.732 --> 1:04:23.109
This ruins everything.

1:04:24.819 --> 1:04:27.071
Daniel, I needed this.

1:04:27.154 --> 1:04:29.615
How can I get the network
to reconsider Christmas movies

1:04:29.699 --> 1:04:31.117
if this one looks like a joke?

1:04:33.578 --> 1:04:34.453
I'm sorry.

1:04:35.538 --> 1:04:37.582
No, it's not your fault.

1:04:38.583 --> 1:04:40.084
It's... mine.

1:04:51.887 --> 1:04:53.222
I ruined Christmas.

1:05:06.110 --> 1:05:07.278
We can fix this.

1:05:08.112 --> 1:05:08.946
How?

1:05:10.114 --> 1:05:12.158
We need to follow the formula.

1:05:12.241 --> 1:05:15.494
-What formula?
-Is Christopher here today?

1:05:15.578 --> 1:05:17.538
-He's in editing.
-Get him.

1:05:21.375 --> 1:05:23.127
I'm sorry
about the church extras.

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:25.504
Forget that. This isn't about
the Christmas movie right now.

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:26.672
It's about Jessica.

1:05:27.923 --> 1:05:29.383
-Me?
-Yes.

1:05:29.467 --> 1:05:31.177
You need to confront
your character flaw.

1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:33.012
That's what
needs to happen right now.

1:05:33.095 --> 1:05:36.098
-Wait. Like, in
a Christmas movie?
-Yes.

1:05:38.851 --> 1:05:40.186
Do you have a better idea?

1:05:43.898 --> 1:05:44.940
Then let's get to it.

1:05:47.902 --> 1:05:50.529
That's what I've
been saying this whole time.

1:05:52.615 --> 1:05:53.949
You know what you need to say.

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:55.951
So just say it.

1:06:01.540 --> 1:06:04.085
Okay.

1:06:04.168 --> 1:06:09.006
-So, you want me to say my
perfectionism gets in my way?
-Yep.

1:06:09.090 --> 1:06:11.676
-That's it.
-I'm afraid so, yeah.

1:06:15.513 --> 1:06:16.722
Okay, then.

1:06:19.141 --> 1:06:21.185
So, let's unpack that.

1:06:21.268 --> 1:06:22.812
Where do you think
that comes from?

1:06:23.479 --> 1:06:25.147
I don't know.

1:06:25.231 --> 1:06:27.692
Jessica, think.

1:06:27.775 --> 1:06:30.277
Haven't you ever been
to therapy?

1:06:30.361 --> 1:06:32.279
It's always a tether
to your childhood.

1:06:33.364 --> 1:06:34.532
What was it for you?

1:06:37.326 --> 1:06:38.202
Well...

1:06:40.496 --> 1:06:42.915
I guess
my parents fought a lot.

1:06:42.998 --> 1:06:44.250
-I'm so sorry.
-Shh.

1:06:49.714 --> 1:06:52.550
And I always just tried so hard
to be perfect, you know.

1:06:54.009 --> 1:06:55.553
Like,

1:06:55.636 --> 1:06:57.888
just so I wouldn't give them
another thing to fight about.

1:07:00.766 --> 1:07:05.354
But every year when we went
to visit my Grandma Pearl
at Christmas time,

1:07:07.815 --> 1:07:10.151
everyone would be
on their best behavior.

1:07:12.695 --> 1:07:14.989
Cuddling up with Grandma Pearl

1:07:16.574 --> 1:07:19.618
and watching people fall
in love at Christmas time.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:22.621
That was, um...

1:07:24.123 --> 1:07:25.833
That was my safe space.

1:07:28.461 --> 1:07:31.464
That's the feeling that I
always wanted to create

1:07:31.547 --> 1:07:34.467
with my movies, you know.

1:07:34.550 --> 1:07:36.635
To give everyone else
that feeling.

1:07:39.388 --> 1:07:40.723
And...

1:07:40.806 --> 1:07:43.267
if I can't get it perfect,
I just...

1:07:44.894 --> 1:07:47.229
feel like I'm just letting
everyone down.

1:07:49.190 --> 1:07:51.108
So...

1:07:51.776 --> 1:07:52.651
There it is.

1:07:55.571 --> 1:07:58.115
You can't make a perfect movie,
Jessica.

1:07:59.992 --> 1:08:01.702
I bet all those movies
the two of you watched together

1:08:01.786 --> 1:08:02.953
weren't perfect either.

1:08:03.037 --> 1:08:07.041
No, not by a long shot.

1:08:07.124 --> 1:08:10.252
Um... Neither was my movie,
<i>Perfectly Christmas.</i>

1:08:10.336 --> 1:08:11.796
And people loved it anyway,
because--

1:08:11.879 --> 1:08:13.172
Because it had heart.

1:08:17.092 --> 1:08:18.636
It's not an equation.

1:08:19.386 --> 1:08:21.263
It's an art form.

1:08:21.347 --> 1:08:24.475
It's an art form where all
these people get to come
together and contribute

1:08:24.558 --> 1:08:27.394
to make this one special thing.

1:08:27.478 --> 1:08:31.357
And that is what's
on the screen. It's the love.

1:08:36.278 --> 1:08:38.155
You guys are right.

1:08:38.239 --> 1:08:40.658
Everything does not have
to be perfect.

1:08:44.036 --> 1:08:46.789
Okay, boom. There it is.

1:08:46.872 --> 1:08:48.624
We have addressed
your character flaw.

1:08:50.459 --> 1:08:53.587
Now the final resolution
to the main conflict
can present itself.

1:09:02.429 --> 1:09:03.806
Can present itself.

1:09:27.746 --> 1:09:29.164
Santa!

1:09:31.250 --> 1:09:32.835
Ho, ho, ho!

1:09:35.462 --> 1:09:38.132
Where are all the children?

1:09:38.215 --> 1:09:41.343
I heard there was a Christmas
Celebration happening here.

1:09:44.722 --> 1:09:47.600
Yes, I am sorry.

1:09:47.683 --> 1:09:49.476
I can get you signed in, Santa.

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:53.480
Santa doesn't sign in.
Santa comes down the chimney!

1:09:54.023 --> 1:09:55.274
Okay.

1:09:55.357 --> 1:09:57.109
Were you able
to find parking all right?

1:09:57.192 --> 1:09:59.987
Oh, no trouble at all. I've got
the reindeer up on the roof.

1:10:00.070 --> 1:10:01.822
Of course.

1:10:01.906 --> 1:10:03.616
Just what we need,
a method Santa.

1:10:03.699 --> 1:10:05.117
Where are my elves?

1:10:05.201 --> 1:10:07.912
-I can lead you
to your trailer.
-Okay.

1:10:08.996 --> 1:10:11.123
Music! There must be music!

1:10:11.206 --> 1:10:13.792
I can play you music
on my guitar, Santa.

1:10:13.876 --> 1:10:15.294
Oh!

1:10:15.377 --> 1:10:17.880
-Daniel, wait!
-Yeah?

1:10:20.007 --> 1:10:22.468
Can you play Christmas songs
on your guitar?

1:10:22.551 --> 1:10:24.511
I can play the chords
to just about anything.

1:10:24.595 --> 1:10:25.763
It won't be perfect, though.

1:10:25.846 --> 1:10:27.222
Doesn't matter.

1:10:27.306 --> 1:10:29.016
Does anyone else on the crew
play an instrument?

1:10:32.478 --> 1:10:33.979
The editor does.

1:10:34.063 --> 1:10:35.481
How do you know that?

1:10:35.564 --> 1:10:37.900
I spent a lot of time
with him in there.

1:10:37.983 --> 1:10:39.985
He's a little weird.

1:10:40.069 --> 1:10:42.488
Well, maybe we can put together
a band after all.

1:10:42.571 --> 1:10:45.491
Let's ask everyone on the crew
if they play an instrument.

1:10:45.574 --> 1:10:47.242
If they do, they're in
the band, if they don't,

1:10:47.326 --> 1:10:50.454
then we'll use them as
townsfolk for the celebration.

1:10:50.537 --> 1:10:51.664
We'll still need a singer.

1:10:53.916 --> 1:10:55.167
You got it.

1:10:55.250 --> 1:10:56.752
Just follow me this way, sir.

1:10:59.546 --> 1:11:01.048
All hands-on deck,

1:11:01.131 --> 1:11:03.342
and maybe with the help of
a little Christmas magic--

1:11:03.425 --> 1:11:05.636
Love can save Christmas!

1:11:09.848 --> 1:11:13.519
Hey, fellas, bring it in.
Bring it in.
Over here. Let's go.

1:11:13.602 --> 1:11:15.396
Quick little team meeting.

1:11:19.441 --> 1:11:22.111
Guys, I need your help.

1:11:23.779 --> 1:11:25.239
Hey, Brett.

1:11:25.322 --> 1:11:26.865
Any chance you got your violin?

1:11:32.579 --> 1:11:35.124
Who wants to be on camera
for once?

1:11:37.209 --> 1:11:38.544
I have an idea for you.

1:11:39.795 --> 1:11:41.088
Who wants to be in a movie?

1:11:54.059 --> 1:11:54.935
Look at that.

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.087
-Oh, that's good...

1:12:22.171 --> 1:12:24.923
-Chloe.
-What do you want?

1:12:25.007 --> 1:12:26.592
I have something to show you.

1:12:26.675 --> 1:12:29.303
Your bakery doesn't
have to close.

1:12:29.386 --> 1:12:30.804
You two seem good.

1:12:30.888 --> 1:12:32.723
-Yeah, we're great.
-Yeah, we're really good.

1:12:32.806 --> 1:12:35.100
-We're so good.
-So, his girlfriend actually
met someone

1:12:35.184 --> 1:12:37.936
on the movie that she's doing
and dumped him.

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:40.147
-So, it's like perfect timing.
-Perfect timing.

1:12:40.230 --> 1:12:41.356
I love you.

1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:44.318
-You're so hot.
-You're so... hot.

1:12:44.401 --> 1:12:46.570
Shut your beautiful lips. Stop.

1:12:46.653 --> 1:12:48.572
Okay,
Christmas miracles everywhere.

1:12:53.577 --> 1:12:55.120
Daniel.

1:12:55.204 --> 1:12:57.081
Did you call our Santa to set?

1:12:57.164 --> 1:13:00.334
I did, 20 minutes ago.

1:13:00.417 --> 1:13:01.877
He's not in his trailer.

1:13:01.960 --> 1:13:03.754
But Christopher's out looking
for him now.

1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:08.008
Okay... Well...

1:13:08.092 --> 1:13:09.134
Hey, Daniel!

1:13:11.178 --> 1:13:12.471
Coming!

1:13:12.554 --> 1:13:14.848
The dog pooped on set.

1:13:14.932 --> 1:13:16.850
Did the dog poop
on set?

1:13:16.934 --> 1:13:18.894
Bob, don't... Bob!

1:13:24.274 --> 1:13:26.860
-We have a problem.
-Yeah, we do.

1:13:30.572 --> 1:13:33.534
Theresa! Hi!

1:13:33.617 --> 1:13:35.285
Uh, what brings you to set?

1:13:35.369 --> 1:13:38.163
Christopher insisted
that I come see this...

1:13:38.247 --> 1:13:41.041
-Christmas Celebration shoot.
-Oh.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:43.627
He did? That's, that's...

1:13:44.586 --> 1:13:47.548
That's great.

1:13:47.631 --> 1:13:48.966
Okay, but when is it
gonna start?

1:13:49.049 --> 1:13:51.176
'Cause I haven't got all night.

1:13:51.260 --> 1:13:53.429
We're just
about ready to shoot.

1:13:53.512 --> 1:13:54.680
Shouldn't be too long.

1:13:54.763 --> 1:13:56.223
What...

1:13:56.306 --> 1:13:58.684
What in the world is
that supposed to be?

1:14:01.103 --> 1:14:04.731
We couldn't afford to have
any actual children
in the scene...

1:14:06.442 --> 1:14:07.359
for tonight.

1:14:09.027 --> 1:14:11.864
-It looks ridiculous.
-We'll make it work.

1:14:11.947 --> 1:14:13.365
Will you?

1:14:13.448 --> 1:14:16.493
It's gonna look great,
once the lights come on and...

1:14:17.494 --> 1:14:20.038
-our lenses.
-And Santa?

1:14:21.165 --> 1:14:22.249
What about Santa?

1:14:25.335 --> 1:14:27.087
He is on his way.

1:14:27.171 --> 1:14:28.881
Little reindeer here
about this big?

1:14:28.964 --> 1:14:34.511
Yeah, like this big,
and I also wanted you
to name it Lima.

1:14:36.263 --> 1:14:38.390
-What are you doing?
-Oh!

1:14:38.473 --> 1:14:40.976
These wonderful children
just needed a little
Christmas magic.

1:14:41.059 --> 1:14:43.854
They're ready to shoot.
I have to get you to set.

1:14:43.937 --> 1:14:47.482
No, no, no, I need a few
more minutes with these
delightful youngsters.

1:14:47.566 --> 1:14:49.776
Hi. We don't have
a few more minutes!

1:14:49.860 --> 1:14:52.863
Every 15 minutes that ticks by
is another shot lost
from the movie.

1:14:54.323 --> 1:14:56.408
Santa, you're coming with me.

1:15:15.552 --> 1:15:19.181
We're just waiting for the sun
to go down a little bit more...

1:15:19.264 --> 1:15:20.098
Yeah.

1:15:20.182 --> 1:15:21.683
-For the shot.
-Mmm.

1:15:21.767 --> 1:15:23.602
-It just needs to be...
just right.
-Right.

1:15:23.685 --> 1:15:28.232
I wonder maybe if this is why
our movies go over budget.

1:15:31.026 --> 1:15:33.987
-On Dasher!

1:15:37.199 --> 1:15:39.284
I just read this article.

1:15:39.368 --> 1:15:43.914
This woman whose husband
locked her in the basement
for six months.

1:15:45.707 --> 1:15:48.293
That... would make
a great movie.

1:15:51.046 --> 1:15:51.880
Hello!

1:15:53.632 --> 1:15:54.758
Careful now.

1:16:00.055 --> 1:16:00.889
Hey!

1:16:07.771 --> 1:16:09.147
Well, I think I've seen enough.

1:16:09.231 --> 1:16:11.066
Have Christopher
give me a call.

1:16:12.109 --> 1:16:13.610
He and I have
a lot to discuss.

1:16:13.694 --> 1:16:14.528
Mmm-hmm.

1:16:18.156 --> 1:16:20.200
-All right, we're here!

1:16:20.284 --> 1:16:22.494
-I've got Santa!
-Ho, ho, ho.

1:16:22.577 --> 1:16:25.664
-Theresa, hi.
-Ho, ho, ho.

1:16:25.747 --> 1:16:28.000
Now this is a celebration!

1:16:28.083 --> 1:16:30.836
Oh, hello. Have you been
a naughty girl this year?

1:16:30.919 --> 1:16:32.337
-Daniel!
-Yes.

1:16:32.421 --> 1:16:34.006
-No, no, no.
Santa, how are you?
-Hey.

1:16:34.089 --> 1:16:35.841
-It's nice to have you back
on set.
-Okay.

1:16:35.924 --> 1:16:37.926
Let me escort you
to your throne.

1:16:38.010 --> 1:16:39.970
Um, I am leaving.

1:16:40.053 --> 1:16:41.388
No, no, you can't go.

1:16:41.471 --> 1:16:42.889
You gotta stay for
the Christmas Celebration.

1:16:42.973 --> 1:16:45.559
I think I've seen
what I need to see.

1:16:45.642 --> 1:16:49.062
Come on, everybody
on this movie has worked
so hard to make this special.

1:16:49.146 --> 1:16:54.192
Special? There's crew members
in the movie. There's sandbags
dressed up as children.

1:16:54.276 --> 1:16:56.028
At least I know now that I made
the right decision

1:16:56.111 --> 1:16:57.529
shutting
all of this down.

1:17:03.243 --> 1:17:04.411
What a Grinch.

1:17:05.412 --> 1:17:06.413
Grinch.

1:17:07.539 --> 1:17:09.583
Her heart
is two sizes too small.

1:17:10.459 --> 1:17:12.461
Ms. Frost... Wait!

1:17:16.298 --> 1:17:18.383
-You can't go.
-Why not?

1:17:20.010 --> 1:17:21.887
By any chance,
is there something

1:17:21.970 --> 1:17:25.057
that happened to you
to make you hate Christmas?

1:17:25.140 --> 1:17:27.476
What? Don't be ridiculous.

1:17:29.102 --> 1:17:32.773
-Nothing from when you
were a little girl?

1:17:32.856 --> 1:17:35.400
Did you enjoy Christmas
when you were young?

1:17:35.484 --> 1:17:37.277
Yeah, I enjoyed it enough.

1:17:39.905 --> 1:17:41.406
But...

1:17:41.490 --> 1:17:43.075
there is something.

1:17:44.993 --> 1:17:47.412
Ugh...

1:17:50.665 --> 1:17:54.503
Well, I was finally
going to be the lead
in our Christmas pageant.

1:17:54.586 --> 1:17:55.420
Yeah?

1:17:57.172 --> 1:17:58.715
And then, the choir director's
daughter

1:17:58.799 --> 1:18:01.093
transferred into our school
and she got to do it.

1:18:02.511 --> 1:18:04.346
And you...

1:18:04.429 --> 1:18:06.390
Oh, there weren't
any other parts left
for me to play,

1:18:06.473 --> 1:18:09.935
so, I sat in the audience
and watched her sing
the final song, and,

1:18:10.018 --> 1:18:11.061
get all the attention.

1:18:14.689 --> 1:18:15.524
Theresa.

1:18:18.944 --> 1:18:21.488
You were meant
to be our singer.

1:18:21.571 --> 1:18:24.574
-For what?
-For our Christmas Celebration.

1:18:24.658 --> 1:18:27.619
-Oh--
-You were born
to play this part.

1:18:27.702 --> 1:18:31.206
Oh, no.
No, I'm not a performer.

1:18:31.289 --> 1:18:34.793
You were and it was taken away
from you.

1:18:34.876 --> 1:18:37.254
But I can give it back to you.

1:18:41.633 --> 1:18:44.928
Me? Singing in
a Christmas musical?

1:18:46.179 --> 1:18:50.100
I got you. I believe in you.

1:18:50.183 --> 1:18:52.144
-Just take some breaths.
-Oh...

1:18:52.227 --> 1:18:58.191
And tonight,
you get to share your gifts
with the entire world, at last.

1:18:58.275 --> 1:18:59.568
I would really like that.

1:19:01.153 --> 1:19:01.987
I mean...

1:19:03.071 --> 1:19:04.990
-I guess.
-Let's do this.

1:19:05.574 --> 1:19:06.741
Okay.

1:19:13.707 --> 1:19:14.666
Okay.

1:19:15.876 --> 1:19:17.461
Call it, Daniel.

1:19:17.544 --> 1:19:20.547
All right, party people.
It's celebration time.

1:19:20.630 --> 1:19:22.215
Roll sound.

1:19:22.299 --> 1:19:24.843
Roll camera.

1:19:24.926 --> 1:19:27.304
-Scene 68. Take one. Mark.

1:19:31.057 --> 1:19:33.768
And... action.

1:19:37.814 --> 1:19:39.774
Mmm.

1:19:41.943 --> 1:19:45.447
-Chloe. Hey, Chloe.
-What do you want?

1:19:45.530 --> 1:19:47.240
-I have to show you something.
-What?

1:19:47.324 --> 1:19:49.451
Your bakery
doesn't have to close!

1:19:50.202 --> 1:19:51.369
Why not?

1:19:51.453 --> 1:19:53.997
Our parent company
also owns Landmark Foods.

1:19:54.080 --> 1:19:57.542
I brought your cupcakes to them
and they were a huge hit.

1:19:57.626 --> 1:19:59.920
-The keto cupcakes?
-No, no.

1:20:00.003 --> 1:20:02.839
You were right all along.
It was your original cupcakes.

1:20:02.923 --> 1:20:06.259
Well, yeah, that makes sense.
They're made with love,

1:20:06.343 --> 1:20:08.178
and nothing
is better than that.

1:20:09.513 --> 1:20:11.389
Look. This is a contract

1:20:11.473 --> 1:20:14.059
for Chloe's Cupcakes
to be sold worldwide.

1:20:16.853 --> 1:20:18.730
"Chloe's Cupcakes
will all be made and shipped

1:20:18.813 --> 1:20:22.275
from the original
Chloe's Cakes kitchen
that your mother founded."

1:20:23.318 --> 1:20:25.570
-Right here?
-Right here.

1:20:25.654 --> 1:20:29.908
-I don't want you to have to
leave this beautiful town, and,

1:20:29.991 --> 1:20:32.285
I mean, frankly,
I don't wanna leave either.

1:20:35.830 --> 1:20:37.332
Will you let me stay
and help you?

1:20:39.417 --> 1:20:41.836
Wait. What about Nadia?

1:20:41.920 --> 1:20:43.755
I broke it off with her.

1:20:43.838 --> 1:20:45.924
I should have done it
a long time ago.

1:20:48.677 --> 1:20:54.766
Okay, so, you want to stay here
and help me sell cupcakes?

1:20:56.059 --> 1:20:57.477
Nothing would make me happier.

1:21:00.897 --> 1:21:04.109
-Yeah, I think you're right.

1:21:04.192 --> 1:21:08.488
Oh, we are going to need
a bigger kitchen.

1:21:11.866 --> 1:21:15.787
Welcome, everyone
to the Christmas Celebration.

1:21:15.871 --> 1:21:19.916
<i>This song goes out</i>
<i>to all the Christmas lovers</i>
<i>out there.</i>

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.918
<i>The ones who love Christmas,</i>

1:21:22.002 --> 1:21:25.797
-<i> and the ones who find love</i>
<i>at Christmas.</i>
-Aw!

1:22:43.625 --> 1:22:46.878
Oh, Jeb. This is
the best Christmas ever.

1:22:48.838 --> 1:22:50.715
-Cut!
-That's a cut.

1:22:52.008 --> 1:22:53.134
Where's the snow?

1:22:57.889 --> 1:22:59.933
We can't have the kiss
without the snow.

1:23:00.016 --> 1:23:02.268
I'm sorry, Jessica.
I don't know what's wrong.

1:23:02.352 --> 1:23:03.770
Give me a minute.

1:23:03.853 --> 1:23:05.897
Sorry, guys. That was great.

1:23:05.980 --> 1:23:09.067
Just chill for a second
while we get this situated.

1:23:09.150 --> 1:23:10.068
-Okay.
-Uh...

1:23:10.151 --> 1:23:11.403
Let's go rehearse the kiss.

1:23:11.486 --> 1:23:12.487
Ooh.

1:23:15.281 --> 1:23:18.118
I thought that was going
pretty well until the snow.

1:23:18.201 --> 1:23:20.036
We'll get it. I'm not worried.

1:23:23.873 --> 1:23:25.917
I wanted to tell you that I
tried to convince Theresa

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:29.254
that we needed your Christmas
movies for our international
streaming launch.

1:23:29.337 --> 1:23:31.256
I thought that going worldwide,
like,

1:23:31.339 --> 1:23:33.133
Chloe's Cakes,
would save the day.

1:23:34.384 --> 1:23:35.301
And did it?

1:23:36.845 --> 1:23:38.513
It did not.

1:23:38.596 --> 1:23:40.181
Because that's
not how it works.

1:23:41.099 --> 1:23:42.434
What? Why not?

1:23:42.517 --> 1:23:45.061
You saw the scene.
Logic doesn't save Christmas.

1:23:45.145 --> 1:23:46.938
Love saves Christmas.

1:23:47.772 --> 1:23:49.482
It always does.

1:23:49.566 --> 1:23:51.943
Well, love can save cupcakes,

1:23:52.027 --> 1:23:54.237
but maybe it can't save
a movie deal.

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:59.659
Oh, my! That was
so exhilarating!

1:23:59.743 --> 1:24:01.536
-I loved it!
-You were amazing!

1:24:01.619 --> 1:24:03.037
-I was okay?
-Amazing.

1:24:03.121 --> 1:24:06.166
I was amazing? Oh, gosh,
I just...

1:24:06.249 --> 1:24:07.459
I forgot the feeling, you know,

1:24:07.542 --> 1:24:09.753
that you get from
Christmas movies.

1:24:09.836 --> 1:24:12.464
And that
our network needs this.

1:24:12.547 --> 1:24:14.299
It... does?

1:24:14.382 --> 1:24:18.094
Nobody wants to watch
women-in-peril at Christmas,
right?

1:24:18.178 --> 1:24:21.973
We need these kinds of movies
to hold onto our audience.

1:24:22.056 --> 1:24:23.600
I feel like I said
something like that.

1:24:23.683 --> 1:24:25.393
I completely agree with you.

1:24:25.477 --> 1:24:27.312
I am going to honor
your contract

1:24:27.395 --> 1:24:30.064
for three
more Christmas movies.

1:24:30.148 --> 1:24:34.360
I am officially reopening
the Christmas Movie division!

1:24:35.570 --> 1:24:37.030
As long as I can be in them.

1:24:37.113 --> 1:24:39.407
Just kidding. I mean, I might.
Guess we'll find out.

1:24:41.910 --> 1:24:42.744
Wow.

1:24:44.287 --> 1:24:45.914
Love saved Christmas.

1:24:46.915 --> 1:24:48.291
Of course, it did.

1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:53.505
Jessica,

1:24:53.588 --> 1:24:54.964
do you remember
when you were talking

1:24:55.048 --> 1:24:56.549
about planting
your flag?

1:24:57.509 --> 1:24:59.302
Yeah.

1:24:59.385 --> 1:25:01.846
This is where I want
to plant my flag.

1:25:01.930 --> 1:25:04.766
Right next to yours,
if you'll let me.

1:25:08.144 --> 1:25:11.272
What about your career
in finance?

1:25:11.356 --> 1:25:13.483
I am done with that.

1:25:13.566 --> 1:25:16.152
I want to be the guy
who helps create this...

1:25:16.236 --> 1:25:18.321
this warm, comforting,
safe place

1:25:18.404 --> 1:25:20.490
that the world gets
to live in at Christmas time.

1:25:22.992 --> 1:25:24.869
Do you need a producer, maybe?

1:25:27.956 --> 1:25:31.960
I don't know. I mean...
uh, a producer...

1:25:32.043 --> 1:25:34.963
You probably gonna have to be
on set with me every day.

1:25:36.881 --> 1:25:38.716
Nothing would make me happier.

1:25:44.556 --> 1:25:47.141
Wait. Stop.
What about your wife?

1:25:48.601 --> 1:25:49.602
My what?

1:25:49.686 --> 1:25:52.897
Your wife. Theresa.

1:25:52.981 --> 1:25:54.023
-Theresa?
-Yes.

1:25:54.107 --> 1:25:55.066
Why are you calling her
my wife?

1:25:55.149 --> 1:25:56.067
Because you did.

1:25:56.150 --> 1:25:58.194
-When?
-In your text.

1:26:00.071 --> 1:26:01.948
Oh, stupid voice-to-text.

1:26:02.031 --> 1:26:03.908
It's keeps dropping words,
not my...

1:26:03.992 --> 1:26:07.787
Not my real wife.
My work wife.

1:26:07.871 --> 1:26:11.332
There it is. Classic romantic
misunderstanding.

1:26:11.416 --> 1:26:15.253
How did I not figure that out?
Right, guys?

1:26:15.336 --> 1:26:16.671
Miscommunication.

1:26:16.754 --> 1:26:18.590
That goes way back to,
like, Shakespeare, and,

1:26:18.673 --> 1:26:20.383
<i>He's Just Not That Into You.</i>

1:26:20.466 --> 1:26:21.968
-Reena?
-Yes.

1:26:22.844 --> 1:26:25.722
Can you give us a moment?

1:26:25.805 --> 1:26:27.140
In the trailer?

1:26:27.223 --> 1:26:29.183
No, just like, a step
or two off to the side.

1:26:32.604 --> 1:26:35.857
I mean, okay...

1:26:36.691 --> 1:26:37.650
So...

1:26:38.943 --> 1:26:39.819
what do you think?

1:26:43.489 --> 1:26:44.365
I think...

1:26:46.367 --> 1:26:48.161
This is
the best Christmas ever.

1:26:58.713 --> 1:26:59.547
I knew it.

1:27:04.052 --> 1:27:05.428
Well, look at that.

1:27:12.185 --> 1:27:15.146
Okay, save some snow
for the movie.

1:27:15.229 --> 1:27:17.315
-That's not me.

1:27:26.157 --> 1:27:27.033
Huh.

1:27:28.409 --> 1:27:29.369
Snow in LA.

1:27:31.245 --> 1:27:33.873
I guess you just can't
contain Christmas magic.
