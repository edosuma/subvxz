00:26.340 --> 00:27.300
And cut!

00:30.260 --> 00:31.460
Got it! Print!

00:32.980 --> 00:33.860
Let's move on.

00:34.060 --> 00:37.820
Next up, scene 55!
Company, move to the stages!

00:46.900 --> 00:49.180
Audrey, your costume's in your room.

00:49.620 --> 00:52.500
Oh, wait, um, and with this.

00:53.060 --> 00:55.660
- I'll try this then. Thanks.
- I'll be on set.

00:55.900 --> 00:56.700
Thank you, sweetie.

01:11.060 --> 01:13.740
The truth will set you free...

01:13.900 --> 01:15.260
The truth will set you free!

01:18.700 --> 01:19.460
Don't move.

01:20.460 --> 01:21.340
Okay.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.420
- I got him. You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.380
Perp is down. Subject is safe.

01:28.580 --> 01:31.140
Good job. Let's take
him in for questioning.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.500
That was easy.

01:33.780 --> 01:35.060
A little too easy.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.540
If you ever want to change jobs,
you'd make a great stunt double.

01:49.060 --> 01:51.020
Jumping out windows
and falling down stairs?

01:52.260 --> 01:54.420
- That's too dangerous for me.
- Well, you get shot at.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.220
- Yeah, but I can shoot back.
- Ha. Touché.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.660
Here she is. She's fine.

02:00.060 --> 02:00.980
Good job.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.660
- You're not hurt?
- Not at all.

02:04.260 --> 02:06.140
And please thank Michel again for me.

02:06.340 --> 02:07.060
I will.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.100
- He's a good man.
- Well, you're all incredible.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.540
Thank you. So, um, this...

02:14.020 --> 02:16.460
this guy, you've... you've
never seen him before?

02:16.700 --> 02:18.740
No. Never. Excuse me.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.220
Uh, you're absolutely sure?

02:24.540 --> 02:26.540
Stalkers usually get
close a number of times

02:26.660 --> 02:29.780
before working up the stones
to make contact with their prey.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.180
"Prey?"

02:31.820 --> 02:35.290
- You make me sound so helpless.
- It's not you, it's them, really.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.220
Stalkers can sometimes
be very dangerous people.

02:38.340 --> 02:39.820
Especially if they are delusional.

02:40.980 --> 02:44.580
We think that you may not be his first.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.340
Tonino Piovani received
the same hate mail as you.

02:50.220 --> 02:53.220
"All false idols must die"? Piovani and me?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.100
Yeah.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.420
Okay, we're ready for touch-ups, Audrey!

02:56.660 --> 02:57.380
Right...

02:58.340 --> 03:00.220
We will contact you
about making a statement.

03:00.740 --> 03:01.700
Anything you need.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.340
- You take care.
- Thank you.

03:08.580 --> 03:09.420
Okay.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.820
Theo, it's me.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.300
They got him. Let's hope
this is all over now.

04:09.740 --> 04:12.780
Clément Blanc is a French
citizen, 25 years of age.

04:12.980 --> 04:16.019
He has a juvenile record of
various drug-related offenses.

04:16.180 --> 04:16.940
Mostly possession.

04:17.060 --> 04:19.220
Right. Disappeared off the
grid about three years ago.

04:19.380 --> 04:20.060
Disappeared?

04:20.220 --> 04:22.019
No records, cell phone, bank card usage,

04:22.340 --> 04:25.460
no IP address, nothing.
As if he ceased to exist.

04:25.740 --> 04:28.260
You searched him, he had nothing on him?

04:28.420 --> 04:30.620
Only the tranquilizer
gun and that necklace.

04:30.780 --> 04:31.540
The dart gun,

04:31.660 --> 04:35.180
very different from the
murder in Rome two months ago.

04:35.540 --> 04:39.140
Piovani didn't get sedatives.
Just a knife, four times.

04:39.260 --> 04:41.740
Maybe Piovani wasn't
supposed to die immediately?

04:41.940 --> 04:45.180
To what end? Kidnapping? Ransom?

04:45.300 --> 04:47.060
Torture? Maybe he wanted information?

04:47.220 --> 04:49.540
About what?
- $64,000 question.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.980
Why warn the potential targets by mail?

04:52.620 --> 04:53.740
It doesn't make sense.

04:54.380 --> 04:56.500
All it did here was allow us to catch him.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.660
We've been here almost half an hour,

05:04.460 --> 05:08.100
and all we've done is
memorize each other's faces.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.060
This isn't about making things worse.

05:14.500 --> 05:15.980
You were caught in the act.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.140
I'm not trying to incriminate you.

05:19.740 --> 05:23.700
I just want to give you the
chance to explain yourself.

05:24.380 --> 05:25.900
To tell me your truth.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.820
Is there something about the truth?

05:30.060 --> 05:31.460
There is no truth here.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.420
Maybe you can provide some.

05:33.820 --> 05:35.620
Stop defending the lies.

05:37.020 --> 05:38.300
What prevails,

05:39.460 --> 05:41.180
what survives, will be the truth.

05:42.340 --> 05:43.500
That makes sense.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.180
Audrey St. Marie?

05:52.460 --> 05:53.740
Do you think she lied to you?

05:54.060 --> 05:56.700
She lies to the world.
She's the queen of lies.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.900
She pretends to be other people.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.140
You wanted to what,
make her tell the truth?

06:07.780 --> 06:10.580
Kill her so she would stop lying?

06:14.220 --> 06:17.260
- Carl, what do you think?
- Don't know yet.

06:21.860 --> 06:22.980
Seeger, incoming.

06:39.980 --> 06:41.140
Oh, man.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.140
When's the last time you
were in Italy, Clément?

06:50.860 --> 06:52.260
The name Piovani?

06:54.060 --> 06:55.100
Ring a bell?

06:56.300 --> 06:57.180
Hmm?

06:58.780 --> 07:00.140
No? You know,

07:00.300 --> 07:01.260
I'm just trying to get

07:01.660 --> 07:04.180
a reading on whether you're
a garden-variety asshole, or

07:04.700 --> 07:06.380
full-on Looney Tunes psychopath?

07:08.100 --> 07:08.860
You know,

07:10.940 --> 07:13.260
at first I thought this
was just for a quick buck.

07:13.580 --> 07:16.500
You know, threaten an
actress, take her hostage,

07:16.620 --> 07:18.740
get the insurance company
for the film to pay up.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.180
There's no profit in falsehood.

07:25.340 --> 07:27.540
You have a problem with us
thinking that you profited?

07:27.700 --> 07:30.540
- You're making false accusations.
- Which accusation is false?

07:31.620 --> 07:33.500
You were going to kill
her, or just take her?

07:35.140 --> 07:38.860
- What was your goal?
- They are all false idols.

07:39.780 --> 07:44.220
That is just the phrase in these letters.

07:45.700 --> 07:46.860
They were sent to...

07:47.420 --> 07:48.740
Audrey St. Marie

07:50.060 --> 07:52.460
and Tonino Piovani.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.900
He was stabbed to death. Did
you do that, Clément, hmm?

07:56.460 --> 07:57.740
Did you hack him up?

08:02.620 --> 08:04.900
There are many false idols.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.900
So why Audrey? Hmm?

08:10.660 --> 08:11.980
She is only a symbol,

08:13.100 --> 08:16.820
a mask for the lies. There
is no profit in falsehood.

08:17.020 --> 08:18.300
Yeah, so you said.

08:19.140 --> 08:21.140
Well, uh, no worries.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.620
You're not going anywhere,
and we have forever.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.140
Forever may not be as long as you think.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.659
What do you mean?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.820
This world ends soon.

08:38.059 --> 08:42.700
It will be reborn from night into day.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.860
But not before the weekend, right?

08:46.980 --> 08:48.980
Because I got tickets for a hockey game...

08:55.980 --> 08:57.500
What's going on there, Clément?

09:05.460 --> 09:06.500
We need a medic.

09:11.490 --> 09:12.650
That was the hospital.

09:13.170 --> 09:16.770
He has serious concussion, and
there may be cerebral damage.

09:16.930 --> 09:18.370
Not that we need any more bad news,

09:18.490 --> 09:21.410
but I can't find any indication
that Clément was ever in Italy.

09:21.530 --> 09:24.050
So we are certain the
two murders are connected,

09:24.170 --> 09:26.050
but we don't have any
evidence to that effect.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.290
Aside from one delusional nutter?

09:28.410 --> 09:31.330
An Italian film agent, a French
actress filming in Holland,

09:31.530 --> 09:33.330
and a French perpetrator.

09:33.450 --> 09:35.730
It's almost too random to be random.

09:35.890 --> 09:37.970
Maybe he's a movie critic.
The French can be tough.

09:38.530 --> 09:40.530
"The world reborn from night into day."

09:41.090 --> 09:44.890
Don't apocalyptic visions usually
come from a group mentality?

09:46.370 --> 09:49.810
Yeah, they do. Like a cult, with followers.

09:50.010 --> 09:52.690
There could be more assailants
and potential victims.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.530
So the crimes can be connected
even if Clément isn't.

09:55.930 --> 09:57.570
There has to be a connection
between the victims.

09:57.690 --> 10:01.170
Carl, Sebastian, Tommy, go back
to the crime scene in Italy.

10:01.290 --> 10:04.330
Arabela, we are going to France
to talk to Clément's mother.

10:20.010 --> 10:23.690
Wow. I didn't know film agents
lived as good as film actors.

10:23.810 --> 10:26.530
10% of everything and no
paparazzi following you around?

10:26.770 --> 10:28.130
Nice gig, if you ask me.

10:28.850 --> 10:30.250
Someone followed this guy.

10:32.210 --> 10:33.690
Piovani didn't show up to work.

10:34.770 --> 10:36.130
Assistant found the body.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.330
Plastic bag over his head.

10:46.970 --> 10:48.810
He was nailed to the door through his...

10:50.890 --> 10:53.970
feet and hands, then stabbed four times.

10:54.730 --> 10:56.530
- He bled out.
- Piovani weighed what,

10:57.050 --> 10:58.050
about a hundred kilos?

10:59.450 --> 11:01.010
And how the hell did Clément do that?

11:01.250 --> 11:03.730
You couldn't nail a guy up to
a door like that without help.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.490
Here we go, it's cooking all the data.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.130
That's Piovani.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.770
Pool of blood collecting
there under his feet.

11:29.810 --> 11:30.970
What does that look like to you?

11:33.130 --> 11:35.090
Imprint of a shoe. Let me zoom in.

11:36.850 --> 11:37.690
A trainer.

11:38.610 --> 11:39.770
Yeah, the right one.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.650
Stab, stab, stab, stab...

11:50.410 --> 11:51.530
Four times...

11:52.850 --> 11:55.490
from this angle,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.530
the perp was standing in
this position right here.

12:00.530 --> 12:01.690
He was right-handed.

12:02.050 --> 12:02.810
And?

12:05.690 --> 12:06.930
Clément's a lefty.

12:13.050 --> 12:14.250
When may I see him?

12:15.210 --> 12:18.170
Unfortunately, we have not
finished interviewing him yet.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.450
I do not know what more I could have done.

12:20.970 --> 12:21.890
I know what you feel.

12:23.930 --> 12:24.970
Do you have children?

12:25.890 --> 12:27.130
I had a son.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.610
Oh, so sorry.

12:31.010 --> 12:33.050
What was Clément like as a boy?

12:33.450 --> 12:35.770
At 16, he became involved in drugs.

12:37.170 --> 12:39.930
If it's any consolation,
he tested clean for us.

12:40.770 --> 12:42.570
He stopped completely
a couple of years ago.

12:43.010 --> 12:43.970
How'd he do it?

12:47.370 --> 12:48.450
He found someone.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.570
That's Nicholas Wells. He's a New Yorker.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.170
Yeah, he's a big-time director.

13:07.450 --> 13:08.570
Yeah, he was killed, too.

13:08.930 --> 13:10.890
Yeah, about six months ago.

13:11.610 --> 13:14.250
Yeah, Upper West Side.
Major news. Big case.

13:14.410 --> 13:15.970
And he and Piovani knew each other.

13:17.050 --> 13:18.810
- Who are you calling?
- Amanda.

13:19.370 --> 13:21.490
In New York? Do you know
what time it is there?

13:21.770 --> 13:24.010
Yeah, she won't care.
She's all about the job.

13:26.850 --> 13:29.170
- Amanda, it's me.
- Do you know what time it is?

13:29.530 --> 13:31.410
- What?
- It's 2:00 in the morning.

13:31.530 --> 13:34.250
Oh, it is? Sorry about that.

13:34.490 --> 13:35.410
I didn't mean to wake you.

13:36.010 --> 13:37.850
But as long as you're up,
I got something for you.

13:38.330 --> 13:39.850
Is this going to mean
another trip to Europe?

13:40.010 --> 13:40.810
Yeah.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.370
The young man's name was Mathis...

13:45.490 --> 13:48.250
and they started to spend
all their time together,

13:48.610 --> 13:51.450
and just like that,
Clément stopped the drugs.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.490
- But then he met the others.
- The others?

13:57.490 --> 13:58.730
Friends of Mathis.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.250
Clément didn't share much,

14:01.410 --> 14:03.330
but I had the impression they were

14:03.730 --> 14:06.250
part of a spiritual society of some kind.

14:07.090 --> 14:08.650
And he changed?

14:09.810 --> 14:11.010
He became...

14:12.530 --> 14:13.450
distant.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.450
Told me our relationship was a lie.

14:18.010 --> 14:21.170
Can you believe it? His own mother.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.570
Did he mention any other names?

14:25.850 --> 14:28.650
Or maybe where the group might be located?

14:29.650 --> 14:33.330
No, just that it was here
in France, and that...

14:34.730 --> 14:39.450
uh, it would be a... a
a rebirth, or something.

14:40.450 --> 14:42.970
Did he say something
about the end of the world?

14:44.490 --> 14:48.690
My world ended three years
ago when Clément vanished.

14:58.570 --> 15:01.330
This photo was taken yesterday.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.130
Clément...

15:31.890 --> 15:32.610
Theo.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.890
I need to meet you. Tonight.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.610
Meet? Why?

15:38.690 --> 15:41.850
It's important. We must meet tonight.

15:42.850 --> 15:46.610
If you insist. How about
11:00 on Prinsestraat?

15:47.130 --> 15:48.890
Blink your lights, I'll come to you.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.530
You're not a journalist, you're a cancer,

15:59.930 --> 16:01.530
spreading your lies to the world.

16:02.170 --> 16:06.250
Do you know who can never, ever tell a lie?

16:07.690 --> 16:08.690
A dead man.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.820
Just can't live without me, can you?

16:32.740 --> 16:34.580
Fly all night, and then straight to work.

16:35.820 --> 16:36.860
That's impressive.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.460
I was reviewing the case on the plane.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.620
I don't want to waste any time.

16:39.740 --> 16:40.980
Let's get right to it.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.180
This way.

16:49.060 --> 16:52.740
Clément Blanc, this
here is Detective Andrews,

16:52.860 --> 16:54.540
she came all the way from New York City.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.380
She took a red-eye.

17:01.140 --> 17:02.220
Nicolas Wells?

17:03.300 --> 17:05.060
He was murdered six months
ago. Did you know him?

17:11.380 --> 17:12.579
Help me out here.

17:15.380 --> 17:18.180
You brought me 3,500 miles to meet a mime?

17:18.700 --> 17:19.859
This is good for him.

17:19.980 --> 17:21.900
Last time, he tried to put
his head through a table.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.220
I read the transcripts
from your interview, Clem.

17:29.380 --> 17:31.180
Seems like you're pretty
interested in the truth.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.060
How about this truth?

17:33.540 --> 17:35.660
Either you or your good buddy killed Wells,

17:35.780 --> 17:39.060
but I can't... I can't find any
record of you entering the U.S.

17:40.780 --> 17:42.340
I like Mathis for this one.

17:44.460 --> 17:45.420
Mathis?

18:02.660 --> 18:04.580
All right, we've got good
news and we've got bad news.

18:04.740 --> 18:05.580
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.260
Clément Blanc confessed to the murder
of Nicholas Wells in New York City.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.740
That is the good news?

18:11.900 --> 18:14.620
Bad news is he also confessed
to killing Tonino Piovani.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.500
Yeah, he's a liar. He lies.

18:16.700 --> 18:19.620
"All false idols will be
destroyed by their own lies.

18:19.940 --> 18:22.620
Those who worship them
shall choke on their ashes.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.100
We shall bring truth to the world."

18:25.380 --> 18:27.380
I think the key word here is "we."

18:27.540 --> 18:29.700
Nicolas Wells received
nearly identical letters.

18:29.980 --> 18:31.780
Nicholas Wells was shot four times.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.340
Any one of those shots
would have been fatal.

18:35.380 --> 18:39.260
Four nails, then four stab
wounds in the Italian case.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.740
Each victim was killed on
the fourth day of the month.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.260
Nice and symmetrical, but a connection?

18:45.540 --> 18:47.780
I could never get that
past a D.A. in Brooklyn.

18:47.940 --> 18:50.660
Well, I mean, it might have a
significance. Four, four, four...

18:50.780 --> 18:53.100
- Could be mathematically symbolic.
- Or spiritual.

18:53.220 --> 18:56.380
The mother mentioned a group,
a spiritual group, a cult.

18:57.020 --> 18:58.300
This could be the symbol of that.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.220
I'm running the design
against known cults right now.

19:01.380 --> 19:02.460
Well, if this is cult-related,

19:02.620 --> 19:04.140
and they're talking about
the end of the world,

19:04.300 --> 19:05.580
this might be a little
bit bigger than we thought.

19:05.700 --> 19:08.460
We've had some real nightmare
scenarios with cults worldwide.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.020
- Yeah, Sarin gas, Tokyo.
- Jonestown. Waco.

19:11.260 --> 19:12.900
Uh, nothing.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.780
There's no record of a cult
using a symbol like this.

19:16.420 --> 19:19.340
It could be new, though. Too
recent to have been reported.

19:20.740 --> 19:22.260
Yeah. Madame Blanc?

19:22.460 --> 19:23.900
Major Daniel. Yes.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.060
I think it is time for you
to be reunited with your son.

19:37.740 --> 19:38.460
Audrey.

19:41.020 --> 19:41.740
Yeah.

19:42.540 --> 19:43.460
Okay.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.820
Yeah, bye. So sorry. Terry, my director.

19:48.700 --> 19:52.940
As I said, "The hardest
working woman in show business"

19:53.420 --> 19:56.380
You are the hardest working
man in your business.

19:58.340 --> 20:00.580
I ordered the crispy herring for starters.

20:00.740 --> 20:02.900
Oh! Parfait.

20:03.020 --> 20:05.860
- You... you remembered?
- I did.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.220
No, thank you. I gave up alcohol last year.

20:08.340 --> 20:09.860
- You did?
- Mm-hm.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.780
Oh, goodness me. You so loved champagne.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.140
So, what shall we eat?

20:17.660 --> 20:20.020
Doctor said they got the
results of his CAT scan.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.580
It's good news, they didn't find any.

20:23.860 --> 20:26.620
- Cats.
- You've been using that joke for 15 years.

20:26.780 --> 20:28.740
Yeah, and it's been working for 15 years.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.940
- No, it doesn't work.
- Yes, it does.

20:35.450 --> 20:36.210
So...

20:38.530 --> 20:39.770
Shari?

20:44.450 --> 20:45.410
Have you tried?

20:47.490 --> 20:48.770
Still giving her space.

20:49.330 --> 20:51.050
- Chicken shit.
- Whatever.

21:08.810 --> 21:09.730
This is for you.

21:10.650 --> 21:13.530
All he wants is that you
don't hurt his friend Mathis.

21:13.970 --> 21:14.890
It's okay.

21:17.930 --> 21:18.810
Thank you.

21:23.730 --> 21:27.170
Louis. We've got Mathis'
address. He's in The Hague.

22:24.450 --> 22:26.690
- That was delicious.
- Aw, look at the time.

22:29.810 --> 22:30.570
Yes, Sir.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.250
I'll introduce you to
your security team tonight.

22:34.370 --> 22:36.770
I have my own security staff at the studio.

22:37.450 --> 22:39.730
And surely with that
young man in custody...

22:39.890 --> 22:42.930
It's just for a few days,
until we sort things out.

22:43.650 --> 22:45.770
They'll be waiting when I
take you back to the hotel.

22:46.290 --> 22:49.410
Oh, don't fuss, Michel. I
have a friend picking me up.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.770
The phone belongs to Theo
Baudouin, a French film journalist.

22:54.890 --> 22:58.290
He had a 30-second conversation with
Audrey St. Marie, this afternoon.

22:58.530 --> 22:59.690
Yeah. We tried to call her immediately,

22:59.810 --> 23:01.170
but it went to voice mail.

23:01.370 --> 23:04.010
- I've tracked the signal, though.
- She's with Dorn, Prinsestraat.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.210
I'll get Eva.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.090
Oh, that's for me.

23:17.370 --> 23:19.250
Thank you for a wonderful evening.

23:19.650 --> 23:23.810
You're ravishing, Audrey.
Quite simply the best company.

23:27.930 --> 23:28.890
Yes, Louis?

23:29.010 --> 23:32.410
Dorn, stay with Audrey, she's in danger.

23:32.610 --> 23:33.570
Audrey, stop!

23:37.010 --> 23:38.650
Stay back! Drop it!

23:39.250 --> 23:40.810
- Drop it!
- Drop it! Now!

23:55.930 --> 23:57.210
We need an ambulance here!

23:57.530 --> 24:00.690
Audrey... come... come away. Come away!

24:04.250 --> 24:05.530
Another true believer.

24:11.310 --> 24:14.990
Louis? They lost him. He
died on the operating table.

24:15.110 --> 24:17.470
- Christ of almighty!
- My thoughts exactly.

24:17.710 --> 24:18.750
Who was this young man?

24:18.910 --> 24:23.430
Mathis Carteaux, French,
20. Same M.O. as Clément.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.470
They were both wearing identical
talismans around their necks.

24:26.670 --> 24:29.430
Between Clément's self-mutilation
on the interrogation table,

24:29.590 --> 24:31.870
and this guy Mathis throwing
himself in front of traffic,

24:31.990 --> 24:34.670
these guys are like suicide
bombers without a bomb.

24:34.950 --> 24:38.670
But they butchered the other victims,
and tried to drug Audrey instead.

24:38.950 --> 24:40.510
I'll let her know what's happening.

24:40.630 --> 24:43.270
Is there nothing more we can
get from this Mr. Clément Blanc?

24:43.390 --> 24:44.630
He's completely brainwashed.

24:44.790 --> 24:46.230
If we can crack the
spell, we can get to him.

24:46.350 --> 24:47.870
What about the apartment?

24:47.990 --> 24:51.070
Transient place, sublet of a sublet.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.830
Paid in cash. No computers, no cell.

24:53.990 --> 24:55.590
But I haven't been able to find anything

24:55.750 --> 24:57.270
on the internet that matches that necklace.

24:57.670 --> 25:01.310
The lab tested it. It's an alloy
of bronze, silver, and copper.

25:01.470 --> 25:02.310
It's highly unusual.

25:02.470 --> 25:04.150
Something like that would
have to be custom made.

25:04.310 --> 25:05.790
Well, can we find out where it's made?

25:05.910 --> 25:07.110
Sure something as unusual as that

25:07.270 --> 25:09.230
could just as easily be
made in someone's garage.

25:09.430 --> 25:13.350
Or... it was made in one of
only six foundries in Europe

25:13.510 --> 25:16.270
- that casts bespoke metal.
- Any located in France?

25:16.670 --> 25:17.710
Mm-hmm, one.

25:19.350 --> 25:20.830
And if they made these medallions,

25:21.190 --> 25:22.750
they will have the address on the order.

25:31.910 --> 25:35.190
Yes, Madame St. Marie. My name is Dorn.

25:36.790 --> 25:38.470
That's nonsense.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.390
I brought her there myself last night.

25:41.430 --> 25:44.350
Uh... Okay. I will try her cell. Thank you.

26:05.150 --> 26:07.030
I found something odd.

26:07.990 --> 26:09.870
Two years ago, Audrey St. Marie

26:10.030 --> 26:11.910
attended the film festival outside Cassis,

26:12.870 --> 26:15.230
along with Nicolas
Wells and Tonino Piovani.

26:15.470 --> 26:17.190
Thousands of celebrities
attend these events.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.510
It doesn't mean they
actually know each other.

26:19.790 --> 26:21.190
Looks like they did.

26:21.510 --> 26:23.110
Yeah. Nicholas Wells received an award

26:23.230 --> 26:24.750
the night this picture was taken.

26:24.990 --> 26:27.150
April 4th, 2012.

26:27.990 --> 26:30.950
Copyrighted by our dead
journalist, Theo Baudouin.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.830
So that makes four victims.

26:32.950 --> 26:35.830
I don't think we're getting the
whole story from Madame St. Marie.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.950
I wonder if we should
believe any of her story.

26:38.110 --> 26:39.230
No word from her yet?

26:39.510 --> 26:43.670
Dorn has everyone under watch...
airports, roads, everything.

26:43.790 --> 26:45.630
Starting to look like
she wanted to disappear.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.630
"Centre de Vérité."

26:58.870 --> 26:59.990
"Center of Truth."

27:00.710 --> 27:02.750
- Well, the medallion makes sense.
- How so?

27:03.830 --> 27:06.910
One side it depicted a number
four, on the other, a griffin.

27:07.190 --> 27:09.870
- That bird-beast thing?
- It's European mythology.

27:10.430 --> 27:14.270
The wings, feet, and head of
an eagle on the body of a lion.

27:14.710 --> 27:17.670
According to the myth, you can only
speak the truth around the griffin.

27:17.950 --> 27:19.870
You know why I can't lie
to a mythical creature?

27:20.310 --> 27:21.870
Because they don't bloody exist.

27:24.550 --> 27:26.230
Welcome to the Centre de Vérité.

27:29.390 --> 27:31.230
We need to speak to whoever's in charge.

27:32.190 --> 27:32.990
Follow me.

27:56.190 --> 27:57.390
The truth-teller.

28:09.910 --> 28:12.270
Élu? I'm Carl Hickman.

28:12.430 --> 28:14.750
Detectives Seeger and McConnell.

28:14.870 --> 28:16.550
You'll pardon me if I
don't shake your hand.

28:16.910 --> 28:18.470
I wouldn't if you offered.

28:19.430 --> 28:22.070
A handshake is a pact
that only two may enter.

28:23.110 --> 28:24.430
Thus, a secret of a kind.

28:24.750 --> 28:27.270
Actually, a handshake just shows
that you don't have a weapon.

28:28.070 --> 28:29.910
There are no secrets here.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.830
The griffin cannot be lied to.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.390
Well, glad we got that cleared up.

28:36.670 --> 28:38.270
You have a couple of members of your choir

28:38.390 --> 28:40.590
that are suspects in multiple homicides.

28:40.830 --> 28:42.670
Clément Blanc and Mathis Carteaux.

28:43.470 --> 28:46.510
Those... unhappy, broken men.

28:46.710 --> 28:48.230
Isn't it your job to fix them up.

28:53.870 --> 28:57.070
This is no longer simply
a centre of rehabilitation.

28:57.710 --> 29:01.550
I saw death, and was given
the gift of enlightenment.

29:02.470 --> 29:04.590
- You don't say.
- I have seen it.

29:05.150 --> 29:07.350
I felt the griffin talons in my flesh.

29:07.550 --> 29:10.550
It tore out my illusions
and showed me reality.

29:11.510 --> 29:15.070
I share that reality with all of
the pure-hearted that will listen.

29:15.190 --> 29:17.590
What a coincidence, I'm
all about truth and reality.

29:17.830 --> 29:20.070
So, about these two guys...

29:20.230 --> 29:22.550
Those men left our sanctuary a year ago.

29:23.030 --> 29:25.670
Did they say anything or
leave any indication what...

29:25.830 --> 29:27.430
- What they planned?
- Exactly.

29:27.550 --> 29:29.510
We can only plan for the end of the world.

29:30.030 --> 29:32.630
- Do you know what happens then?
- The world ends?

29:32.790 --> 29:36.270
It is transfigured. A new
beginning for the pure.

29:36.590 --> 29:39.470
I, for example, shall become the Griffin.

29:41.470 --> 29:43.270
You're going to become a lion with wings?

29:43.390 --> 29:44.630
I'd like to see that.

29:44.830 --> 29:48.550
I will become of the
Griffin at the end of days.

29:49.270 --> 29:52.710
Today we prepare a feast to
celebrate the imminent new dawn.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.230
- It's like the Last Supper.
- For some.

29:55.710 --> 29:59.150
- And this end of the world is...
- At the break of day, tomorrow.

29:59.870 --> 30:02.510
April fourth. Do the
Mayans know about that?

30:02.630 --> 30:04.310
The fourth day of the fourth month.

30:05.270 --> 30:06.950
The four talons of the griffin.

30:07.750 --> 30:10.910
- The four imperishable truths.
- Are we really listening to this?

30:11.750 --> 30:13.790
I understand it is difficult to comprehend,

30:14.510 --> 30:15.550
but it is the truth.

30:15.830 --> 30:19.030
Are you categorically deny
knowing anything about Clément

30:19.390 --> 30:21.310
or Mathis or what they're doing?

30:21.510 --> 30:24.190
My apologies, I cannot help you.

30:25.270 --> 30:28.430
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

30:28.990 --> 30:30.910
You know, end of the world day.

30:47.950 --> 30:50.830
The picture was taken two years
ago on the fourth of April.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.270
And tomorrow...

30:53.390 --> 30:54.910
is the fourth of April.

30:55.070 --> 30:57.310
Ah, you must be the ICC?

30:58.630 --> 31:01.190
Yes. Major Daniel from the
ICC. This is Detective Berger.

31:01.350 --> 31:02.870
Nice to meet you. Hugo Tati,

31:03.150 --> 31:05.190
Head of Security here. What
can I do for you gentlemen?

31:05.430 --> 31:07.710
- Were you on duty two years ago?
- Every year.

31:07.870 --> 31:11.350
Do you remember seeing the actress
Audrey St. Marie here that year?

31:11.790 --> 31:15.950
Oh, yes. She was drunk and belligerent.

31:17.150 --> 31:18.630
Not a very nice sight.

31:18.870 --> 31:21.310
- Was she alone?
- No, no, there was a group of them.

31:22.950 --> 31:24.470
I remember we had to throw them out.

31:25.470 --> 31:26.990
I remember one of them tried to hit me.

31:27.390 --> 31:30.950
Some American film director
who had just won a prize.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.870
- Nicolas Wells.
- Yeah, that was him.

31:33.070 --> 31:37.070
So they got into a car and
they drove off to the hotel.

31:37.230 --> 31:38.590
What route were they taking?

31:38.710 --> 31:39.830
There's only the one from here.

31:40.830 --> 31:43.270
- It's called La Griffe.
- "The claws."

31:43.470 --> 31:46.790
That's what the locals call
it. A perilous stretch of road.

31:47.470 --> 31:51.030
Twists and turns, cliffs on one side.

31:52.590 --> 31:54.190
Do you recall who was driving that night?

31:55.230 --> 31:56.150
Yes.

31:57.030 --> 31:59.230
It was Audrey St. Marie.

32:00.230 --> 32:01.110
Are you sure?

32:01.750 --> 32:03.070
Oh, yes, I'm sure.

32:35.430 --> 32:38.630
- Hello. I'm Audrey St. Marie.
- Yes, I know who you are.

32:41.030 --> 32:42.430
But what are you doing here?

32:42.590 --> 32:44.470
Does Bruno Antoine live here?

32:45.510 --> 32:47.990
My father died about a year ago.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.270
I'm sorry for your loss.

32:52.790 --> 32:54.790
May I speak with you for a moment?

32:56.030 --> 32:57.790
Sure. Come in.

33:02.750 --> 33:05.270
So not only did all the
victims know each other,

33:05.390 --> 33:08.030
- they also partied together.
- Audrey is a liar.

33:09.070 --> 33:12.510
Hang on. I've been doing some
digging with the local police.

33:12.950 --> 33:15.710
There was a hit-and-run reported
the same night as the film festival.

33:15.990 --> 33:18.150
Late night on the 4th of April, 2012.

33:18.470 --> 33:20.310
A couple was hit by an unidentified car.

33:22.110 --> 33:23.230
La Griffe.

33:24.230 --> 33:28.550
According to this, the couple was
thrown down the cliff into the sea.

33:28.710 --> 33:31.710
She died on impact and her body
was recovered a few kilometres away.

33:32.590 --> 33:36.590
Her husband survived, but
incurred serious brain trauma,

33:37.110 --> 33:38.870
And who reported the accident?

33:40.870 --> 33:43.950
First responding officer
who wrote the report...

33:45.030 --> 33:46.310
Bruno Antoine.

33:47.110 --> 33:48.430
Then we have to find his address.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.390
I only found out about this

33:50.590 --> 33:53.990
charity fund you set up
just before my father died.

33:56.510 --> 33:58.710
I think it's very strange

33:58.870 --> 34:01.150
that a movie star would
be in contact with a

34:01.790 --> 34:03.310
small town policeman.

34:03.790 --> 34:06.230
We met, about two years ago.

34:07.030 --> 34:12.389
And you thought my father should
be the chairman of a charity

34:12.750 --> 34:14.710
for traffic accident victims?

34:15.110 --> 34:17.870
With an annual income of 50,000 euros?

34:18.070 --> 34:19.630
He was the best man for it.

34:20.790 --> 34:23.670
Actually, I would love you to take over.

34:23.989 --> 34:26.270
No. I'm not interested.

34:30.190 --> 34:33.030
Did your father say anything to you?

34:35.190 --> 34:36.989
What do you mean exactly?

34:37.310 --> 34:39.469
About charity or... or me?

34:41.429 --> 34:43.670
He became quite agitated near the end,

34:44.310 --> 34:46.630
wanted me to deliver a letter.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.310
A letter? To me?

34:49.110 --> 34:53.630
No, to a center nearby, some
sort of a spiritual retreat.

34:56.110 --> 34:57.910
But I believe it had
something to do with you.

35:34.562 --> 35:35.602
You meet the high priest?

35:35.882 --> 35:37.322
Well, I hope you don't have any big plans,

35:37.482 --> 35:39.522
because apparently, the end
of the world is tomorrow.

35:40.202 --> 35:42.402
Dammit, I just sent in
my credit card payment.

35:42.642 --> 35:44.282
Hey, I bought hockey tickets.

35:44.442 --> 35:49.202
- They have hockey here?
- Go Amsterdam G's! How's Clément?

35:49.362 --> 35:51.442
Oh, you know, chatty as ever.

35:51.562 --> 35:54.122
Yeah, he was like that even
before he busted his head.

35:56.242 --> 35:59.122
Hang on. How long did you
say he was unconscious for?

35:59.242 --> 36:01.482
Um... couple of days. Why?

36:03.642 --> 36:05.442
We may be able to get
what we need out of him,

36:06.082 --> 36:07.682
but we'll need Sebastian's help.

36:09.322 --> 36:12.402
I'll see you in about three
hours. All right. Taxi!

36:14.402 --> 36:15.562
Can I help you?

36:15.722 --> 36:18.602
Yeah. Major Daniels from
the ICC. Detective Berger.

36:18.802 --> 36:20.642
We're looking for Bruno Antoine.

36:20.882 --> 36:25.122
My father is very popular
today, for a deceased man.

36:25.522 --> 36:26.322
Pardon me?

36:26.882 --> 36:28.722
Well, first a movie
star is looking for him,

36:28.882 --> 36:30.202
and now you, police.

36:30.562 --> 36:33.042
Perhaps you can tell me what's going on?

36:33.202 --> 36:34.882
Are you saying Audrey St. Marie was here?

36:37.322 --> 36:39.882
- Okay, that's odd.
- What is it?

36:40.922 --> 36:43.042
She came with that car,
and I saw her get out.

36:48.042 --> 36:49.242
- Major Daniel.
- Yeah?

36:49.962 --> 36:51.602
- There's no one here.
- Thank you.

36:52.442 --> 36:55.362
Audrey St. Marie tried to
call Dorn, but was cut off.

36:55.802 --> 36:57.202
I found the phone next to her car.

36:57.442 --> 36:58.402
Élu knows we're onto him.

36:58.562 --> 37:00.122
Maybe he's trying to
get a jump on Armageddon.

37:00.442 --> 37:03.722
One of my contacts in Paris
has new information for us.

37:04.362 --> 37:08.562
Two years back, Audrey checked
into rehab on the sixth of April.

37:08.962 --> 37:12.002
She was in a drink-driving
accident only two days before that.

37:12.202 --> 37:14.682
This is the hit-and-run
victim, Frédéric Roubert.

37:14.802 --> 37:16.562
The psycho otherwise known as Élu.

37:17.082 --> 37:20.242
Maybe they returned Audrey
to the scene of her crime.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.362
Come on, let's go.

37:27.382 --> 37:28.502
Look who's back.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.262
Did you miss us?

37:34.622 --> 37:36.902
We suspect your Master Élu
has taken Audrey hostage

37:37.062 --> 37:38.102
and we need to know where.

37:39.662 --> 37:41.382
It's all part of becoming true.

37:42.262 --> 37:43.702
And the end of things.

37:45.182 --> 37:48.982
Which... happens on the fourth of April.

37:49.502 --> 37:51.742
- Correct? Right? Fourth?
- Mm-hmm.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.742
Humanity will be reborn.

37:54.662 --> 37:57.182
It's funny, I just... I
don't feel any different.

37:57.342 --> 37:59.622
- I'm totally good.
- Mm-hmm.

38:01.982 --> 38:04.542
Today is the fifth of April, Clément.

38:09.582 --> 38:10.862
It cannot be.

38:12.262 --> 38:14.542
You were out for a full three days.

38:14.662 --> 38:17.542
You were. Here, look. Look for yourself.

38:21.822 --> 38:23.222
The world didn't end, Clément.

38:25.862 --> 38:27.982
And lucky for me I didn't
tear up my hockey tickets.

38:28.622 --> 38:31.062
Élu used you and your friend Mathis.

38:31.862 --> 38:34.502
He wanted revenge. His real
name is Frédéric Roubert,

38:35.022 --> 38:36.462
and he is no prophet.

38:36.942 --> 38:38.822
He is a sick, cunning murderer.

38:39.182 --> 38:41.902
Now, we need to know where
Audrey is before it's too late,

38:42.102 --> 38:44.022
and you are the only
one who can save her now.

38:45.702 --> 38:47.942
Don't make your mother live with
you making the wrong decision.

39:09.182 --> 39:11.462
They got a tranquilizer gun for
her, so they didn't want to kill her.

39:14.582 --> 39:15.502
Yeah, Carl.

39:16.062 --> 39:19.062
A cliff. Clément says they're
taking Audrey to a cliff.

39:19.222 --> 39:21.702
- I've got the coordinates.
- We know exactly where she is.

39:23.582 --> 39:25.822
Now we can fulfill the prophecy!

39:27.382 --> 39:32.702
A blood sacrifice! Blood
polluted with putrid lies!

39:35.902 --> 39:37.182
Her blood!

39:43.062 --> 39:45.382
Take the sins of the world with you.

39:46.662 --> 39:50.502
Let the lies die with
you on those jagged rocks!

39:50.702 --> 39:52.102
Let the truth be reborn!

39:52.222 --> 39:53.582
Liar!

39:56.102 --> 39:57.902
No, listen! Listen!

39:58.342 --> 40:00.542
I was driving the car
that killed your wife.

40:00.742 --> 40:03.702
I was drunk! I didn't
mean for it to happen!

40:04.542 --> 40:06.662
Please, I beg forgiveness.

40:06.942 --> 40:10.662
Make me as you are, let me be pure.

40:13.182 --> 40:15.662
See how now she even performs for us!

40:16.062 --> 40:18.262
Do not be fooled by this puppet!

40:18.382 --> 40:21.862
No, no, no, this is no act, I swear!

40:22.262 --> 40:24.142
I made a dreadful mistake.

40:26.742 --> 40:29.582
Please, believe me. Please...

40:30.262 --> 40:31.942
Please. Believe me.

40:46.502 --> 40:47.982
Throw her from the cliff!

40:49.022 --> 40:49.982
Now!

40:53.302 --> 40:55.782
Wait! Don't move. Get down?

40:56.022 --> 40:57.782
All of you, get down!
Get down on the ground!

40:58.222 --> 40:59.502
Get down now!

41:01.502 --> 41:03.062
Don't move. Don't move.

41:03.422 --> 41:04.902
Don't move!

41:12.702 --> 41:15.302
- The truth will set you free.
- No!

41:39.542 --> 41:43.462
So you used us to protect
yourself, to hide the truth.

41:44.862 --> 41:47.502
Why did you do it? It was an accident.

41:49.302 --> 41:51.742
Now we have five more people dead.

41:56.822 --> 41:57.862
All right.

42:02.062 --> 42:03.502
Looks like we got company.

42:04.102 --> 42:06.142
I hope she's ready for her close-up.

42:10.062 --> 42:11.902
... A spiritual retreat near Cannes.

42:12.422 --> 42:14.822
The cult leader is
alleged to have manipulated

42:14.942 --> 42:16.902
his followers into a killing spree.

42:17.182 --> 42:20.782
Allegedly, actress Audrey
St. Marie was intoxicated

42:20.902 --> 42:23.222
when her vehicle struck and killed a woman,

42:23.422 --> 42:25.902
perpetuating a cover-up of the incident,

42:26.022 --> 42:28.662
which occurred exactly two years ago.

42:30.262 --> 42:31.222
Well...

42:33.262 --> 42:34.302
Time to go?

42:35.102 --> 42:37.182
Some victories are gratifying, Hickman.

42:38.462 --> 42:39.742
Others just...

42:40.342 --> 42:42.502
make one tired.

42:42.822 --> 42:45.062
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:47.382 --> 42:51.982
Well, the world has been spared at
least until the fourth of next month.

42:52.502 --> 42:54.622
Yeah, we're just like the Justice League.

42:55.142 --> 42:57.022
You're still using that one, too, huh?

42:58.142 --> 43:00.902
- I need new material, don't I?
- You do. You really do.

43:01.102 --> 43:04.942
Come on. You know what? I jumped
on a plane to save your ass,

43:05.102 --> 43:08.342
yet again, the least you
could do is take me for dinner.

43:09.382 --> 43:11.422
There is no place in this town at this time

43:11.582 --> 43:12.982
that I can take you that you would like.

43:14.022 --> 43:15.342
Are you calling me a snob?

43:15.462 --> 43:18.462
No, no, no, I'm just saying, you
don't favor ptomaine poisoning.

43:20.142 --> 43:24.022
Remember what we used to do
late at night at the squad?

43:25.502 --> 43:26.462
Hmm?

43:27.582 --> 43:31.262
Okay, here we go, dessert,
energy bar or candy bar?

43:31.582 --> 43:32.622
I'll have whatever you don't want.

43:32.822 --> 43:34.742
- Energy bar it is.
- Oh, dammit.

43:36.022 --> 43:36.942
You're funny.

43:37.942 --> 43:40.382
You know that? You make me laugh.

43:44.822 --> 43:48.902
So have you really not
spoken to Shari since I left?

43:50.902 --> 43:53.142
- I tried a couple of times.
- Mmm.

43:55.382 --> 43:56.662
She's not feeling it.

43:58.582 --> 43:59.982
I, uh...

44:03.262 --> 44:06.102
I didn't come here just for the case.

44:07.862 --> 44:09.182
I, uh...

44:21.462 --> 44:22.462
What is this?

44:22.702 --> 44:23.662
I did some research,

44:25.302 --> 44:27.582
and since the wars, they
have made incredible progress

44:27.702 --> 44:29.782
with limb medicine for wounded vets.

44:31.102 --> 44:33.422
Arms, legs, hands.

44:34.982 --> 44:39.142
They have made huge strides with bionics.

44:42.782 --> 44:44.022
Like a bionic hand?

44:44.142 --> 44:44.942
I checked with the department,

44:45.102 --> 44:47.982
and they have changed a lot of
the requirements around handicaps

44:48.102 --> 44:50.382
because of all the wounded vets.

44:52.982 --> 44:53.902
So you would just have to,

44:54.062 --> 44:55.862
you know, demonstrate
that you could do your job,

44:57.502 --> 44:58.982
and... they may let you come back.

45:01.022 --> 45:02.662
I mean, I know it would
be... you know, it would be

45:03.502 --> 45:07.822
a lot of treatment,
and it wouldn't be easy,

45:09.502 --> 45:11.582
but I could help you, and
I would be there with you.

45:11.702 --> 45:13.262
I would go with you to your appointments...

45:23.302 --> 45:25.262
- Didn't see that coming, did you?
- Uh, no.

45:27.542 --> 45:29.262
You just could never guess my next move.
