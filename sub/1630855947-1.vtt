WEBVTT

00:22.647 --> 00:24.065
{\an8}Hey! Yeah, I just landed.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.151
{\an8}Hey babe.
So, how's it being home?

00:26.151 --> 00:28.194
{\an8}Uh, so far so good.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.155
{\an8}You're still flying out tomorrow
morning, right?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.698
{\an8}I promised everyone
they'd finally get to meet you.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.367
{\an8}Yes. But there is something
else I have to tell you.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.702
{\an8}Okay. What?

00:35.702 --> 00:36.953
{\an8}Do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

00:36.953 --> 00:39.039
{\an8}Oh... jeez. I... I don't
know, bad.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.832
{\an8}I didn't land
the Kingstead Building.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.625
{\an8}What? They... they said they
weren't making any decisions

00:42.625 --> 00:43.710
{\an8}until the new year.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.753
{\an8}I know.

00:44.753 --> 00:45.962
{\an8}Well, what's the good news?

00:45.962 --> 00:47.714
{\an8}I got it.

00:47.714 --> 00:48.715
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

00:48.715 --> 00:50.550
{\an8}No. I closed this morning.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.635
{\an8}Wait. I'm on a flight
for five hours and you decide

00:52.635 --> 00:55.055
{\an8}that's an appropriate time
to poach my client?

00:55.055 --> 00:58.433
{\an8}No. It isn't personal.
It's just that they trust me

00:58.433 --> 01:01.353
{\an8}a little bit more with this
level of responsibility.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.395
{\an8}Wow.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.063
{\an8}There actually is
one other thing.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.983
{\an8}I know you really want me
to spend the whole week

01:06.983 --> 01:08.360
{\an8}out there...

01:08.360 --> 01:09.944
{\an8}but I sort of promised Laurence

01:09.944 --> 01:11.696
{\an8}that I would take him to that
really fancy sushi restaurant.

01:11.696 --> 01:15.408
{\an8}Well, you're supposed
to be my partner.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.201
{\an8}My teammate.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.702
{\an8}Not go behind my back

01:17.702 --> 01:19.913
{\an8}and steal a client I've been
working on for two months.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.083
{\an8}Ash, come on.
We can get past this.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.751
{\an8}It isn't personal, Trevor.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.420
{\an8}It's just become very obvious

01:27.420 --> 01:29.714
{\an8}that you are not ready for this
level of responsibility.

01:32.050 --> 01:37.764
{\an8}Yeah, I just landed.
I'm in Idaho Lake, or...

01:37.764 --> 01:42.310
{\an8}Idaho Creek, or... something
with Idaho and water.

01:42.310 --> 01:43.728
That's great, Scott.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.438
Yeah. So, hey, if I get called
up to this Boise team,

01:45.438 --> 01:47.607
there's a game the 24th
in Tucson.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.235
I was thinking I could drive up
to Phoenix and meet you.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.361
You don't have to do that.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.487
I thought you wanted me

01:52.487 --> 01:53.947
to spend Christmas
with your family.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.699
This... this is our chance.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.618
I wanted you to want to spend
Christmas with us.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.788
But it's become pretty clear
that's just not who you are.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.498
Do you wanna come here?

02:03.498 --> 02:05.417
We could find a nice
Chinese restaurant.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.002
Scott, you're not hearing me.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.128
I admire your ambition,

02:09.128 --> 02:11.965
we just don't have
the same goals in life.

02:11.965 --> 02:12.882
So, you're cutting me.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.426
Hey, look on the bright side.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.469
At least now you can have
a real, fresh start

02:16.469 --> 02:19.097
out there in Idaho...
whatever it's called.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.808
Yeah. Can't wait.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.767
Bye Scott.

02:22.767 --> 02:23.810
See ya.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.279
Oh... um...

03:02.557 --> 03:04.559
Okay. I think they heard you.

03:04.559 --> 03:05.727
Be there in a second.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.606
Sorry. It's just, it's, uh...

03:09.606 --> 03:12.317
it's... it's been a bit of
a morning.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.818
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:13.818 --> 03:16.363
Well, I've just been traded
to what I can only assume

03:16.363 --> 03:19.407
is the fishing capital
of the world.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.575
I just got off the phone...

03:24.329 --> 03:25.372
You didn't mean literally.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.414
No.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.082
Sorry.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.667
No, it's okay.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.377
Look, I know this place can be
a little jarring at first

03:30.377 --> 03:32.045
but, you know, we've got
some of the best hockey fans

03:32.045 --> 03:33.505
in the country. So...

03:34.839 --> 03:35.840
It's that obvious. Huh?

03:37.425 --> 03:38.718
Yeah, well the stick
and the single duffel

03:38.718 --> 03:40.220
kinda gave it away.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.889
Sorry about the wait.
Cash or card?

03:42.889 --> 03:43.973
Card.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.228
Thanks.

03:48.228 --> 03:48.978
So, you on business
or something?

03:48.978 --> 03:50.397
No, no.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.940
I'm just here visiting family
for the week.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.900
I grew up here but I've been
in New York the last five years.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.776
Hmm.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.569
You should come to a game.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.571
Not that I'm gonna play
for them for very long.

03:58.571 --> 03:59.739
Oh no?

03:59.739 --> 04:01.491
Nah, it's kind of a formality,
you know.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.368
Once they kinda see me in action

04:03.368 --> 04:06.121
they're probably gonna
fast track me up to Boise.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.790
And after that it's just
one stop to the NHL.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.088
Well, it sounds like
you've got a very bright future

04:15.088 --> 04:16.505
ahead of you.

04:16.505 --> 04:17.757
- There you go.
- Thank you.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.761
Oh.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.682
Oh, and that's my ride.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.435
Welcome to Idaho Falls.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.688
So, I'll see you
at the game then.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.027
Julie! and Becca! Hi!

04:37.027 --> 04:38.069
Ash.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.155
Oh.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.282
You look so... sophisticated.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.867
Is that a compliment?

04:43.867 --> 04:48.121
You always look gorgeous!
Just a little less Idaho Falls.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.539
Grandma knitted you a new scarf.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.708
Oh my, she did.
I love it.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.043
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.046
Oh my gosh, you smell so good.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.213
Do I?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.798
Yeah. That must be some
secret shampoo

04:58.798 --> 05:00.925
that they only sell to folks on
Saks Fifth Avenue or something.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.636
You know it's not
a real avenue, right?

05:03.636 --> 05:05.055
Oh.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.848
Well, doesn't matter.
I'm just so happy to see you.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.183
Me too.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.184
Oh hey, congrats on your
real estate license.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.518
- Oh.
- That's awesome.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.729
Well, I'm no big fancy agent
like you

05:12.729 --> 05:14.939
but it sure beats waiting tables
at the Drunken Puck.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.025
Oh yeah, do not remind me
of that place.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.945
So, how are you?
How's Trevor?

05:20.945 --> 05:22.530
Good. Great!

05:22.530 --> 05:25.367
I'm great. Uh...
everything is really good.

05:25.367 --> 05:29.079
Tell me what's new and exciting
in Idaho Falls.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.830
Um... Oh!

05:30.830 --> 05:33.458
We got a new water
treatment plant.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.877
Wow. That sounds important.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.005
Well, to be honest,
the most exciting thing is

05:39.005 --> 05:40.674
is that you're here.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.384
- We miss you.
- I miss you too.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.593
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.388
Come on.
I'm so glad you're here.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.683
We're so happy
to have you back.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.642
You look so...

05:50.642 --> 05:51.559
Pale.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.477
Mom!

05:53.478 --> 05:54.813
No. That's... that's fair.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.481
I have been holed up in
the office a lot lately.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.566
Well, at least you've got
Trevor in the office with you.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.360
Your father and I have been
running the store together

06:00.360 --> 06:02.821
for 30 years now and
that's turned out pretty well.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.031
Yeah, but it's not like
we actually work together.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.701
I mean, it's the same broker
but it's really just...

06:07.701 --> 06:09.244
it's everyone for themselves.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.413
That's too bad.
He still flying in tomorrow?

06:12.747 --> 06:13.748
Um...

06:15.750 --> 06:18.294
Yeah. Yeah, we just have
to figure out his flight.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.005
Well, I'm sure he's worth
the wait.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.756
Well, he'd better be,
'cause any guy that dates

06:21.756 --> 06:25.010
my little sister better treat
her the way that she deserves.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.344
Like my Dave treats me.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.303
Did someone say my name?

06:27.303 --> 06:28.513
Hey! There he is.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.556
Hey. Welcome home, little sis.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.765
Thank you.
Good to see you.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.395
Oh... great fruitcake, Grandma.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.896
Aunt Ashley!

06:36.896 --> 06:39.649
Hey, there's my wild man.
What are you up to today?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.568
Dad and I are going to play
some hockey.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.861
You should come with.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.571
Ah... well, I would but
I promised your grandpa

06:44.571 --> 06:46.072
I'd help him out at the store.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.282
But I hear that you're playing

06:47.282 --> 06:48.408
in the big Christmas game
this year?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.451
You're going to watch?

06:49.451 --> 06:50.910
Uh, yeah.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.287
I mean, someone's gotta keep
the ref on their toes.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.371
Okay Parker, let's roll.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.372
See you later.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.582
Bye! Have fun.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.499
Don't drink too much
hot chocolate

06:56.499 --> 06:57.876
and don't break any bones.

06:57.876 --> 06:58.668
He won't, babe.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.502
I wasn't talking to him.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.181
Hey, Scott!

07:11.181 --> 07:13.058
Assistant Coach Gus.
How you doing?

07:13.058 --> 07:14.809
My ankle still hurts, my
girlfriend broke up with me

07:14.809 --> 07:16.478
and I'm playing hockey
in Idaho Lake.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.271
Um... Idaho Falls.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.940
Idaho Lake's about
20 miles up the road.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.275
Great fishing though.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.027
But, uh, you gotta
use night-crawlers,

07:24.027 --> 07:26.321
them lures ain't gonna
help you at all up there.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.655
Okay.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.074
Now, what else we got
for you Mr. Briggs?

07:29.074 --> 07:32.952
Hey... you have any relation
to Wayne Briggs?

07:32.952 --> 07:35.538
Yeah. He's my dad.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.207
Well, ain't that something.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.125
Two time NHL defenseman
of the year.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.628
Stanley Cup champion.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.713
Hey, isn't he up for the Hall
of Fame here in a few days?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.423
Ah, somebody said something
about accommodation's

07:45.423 --> 07:46.800
free for the first month.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.177
Oh, got that for you
right here, here you go.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.470
Here's this for you.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.638
Now, there's a main house
on the property,

07:51.638 --> 07:53.306
you got a little cottage
in the back.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.766
Perfect.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.685
And being as how you've got
a game in five hours,

07:56.685 --> 07:58.853
we should get you out there
with the rest of the team.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.198
That's it, that's it.
Good job!

08:10.198 --> 08:11.741
Come on Zetner,
move your feet!

08:18.790 --> 08:20.041
Alright boys, bring it
in! Bring it in!

08:25.755 --> 08:27.257
Now this is Scott Briggs.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.843
He just got traded here from
the East Coast Hockey League.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.803
Hey, I played in the ECHL.
What team were you on?

08:31.803 --> 08:33.179
It'd be a lot easier
to tell you

08:33.179 --> 08:34.222
what teams I didn't play for.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.142
Hey. How old are you, Grandpa?

08:37.142 --> 08:38.308
You looking for a fight, son?

08:38.308 --> 08:39.309
Maybe. You wanna start
something or what?

08:39.309 --> 08:40.812
Ah, ah, ah...
settle down Pierre.

08:42.397 --> 08:43.648
Back it up.

08:46.401 --> 08:50.113
Alright. Let's give Briggs here
a big Fighting Trout welcome.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.953
Let's get back to practice

08:56.953 --> 09:00.040
and, uh, Pierre... how about you
lead us in the drills? Let's go.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.752
Have fun out there.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.143
Dad! Hi.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.854
Hey. There she is.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.398
Oh, it's so good to see you, kiddo.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.359
It's good to see you too.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.486
Mom said that you could use some
help with the Christmas stuff?

09:29.486 --> 09:32.739
Well you know me, I never could
turn down a set of extra hands.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.080
So how's the job going?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.123
You sell the Empire State
Building yet?

09:42.123 --> 09:43.958
Ah, you know I'm still working
on that one.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.795
Well, we all need to stop
and smell the pine cones

09:46.795 --> 09:48.254
every now and then.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.131
Or every day if you work here.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.638
Your mom said the boyfriend
had some kind of a delay?

09:56.638 --> 09:58.807
Uh, yeah.
Something like that.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.726
Well, silver lining, that means
you have tonight wide open.

10:01.726 --> 10:02.936
Dad, I don't know.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.398
Oh, I know it's not a fancy
NHL game...

10:06.398 --> 10:07.774
but tonight's should be
a good one

10:07.774 --> 10:09.109
and the whole family's
gonna be there.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.861
I was just hoping to stay home
and relax a bit.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.656
What's not relaxing about
a hockey game?

10:18.493 --> 10:20.078
Okay, I'll be there.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.122
You know I can't pass up
a night with the family.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.082
Mm-hmm. That's my girl.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.458
Oh, I almost forgot.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.252
Your mom wants a fresh wreath
for the front door.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.462
You mind picking one up from
Chuck's while I close up here?

10:29.462 --> 10:30.839
Of course.

10:30.839 --> 10:31.840
Thanks.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.391
Aren't you a little old

10:41.391 --> 10:43.018
to still be chasing
the dream still, pops?

10:43.018 --> 10:46.938
Hey, you didn't hear?
32 is the new 22.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.356
I'm just coming into my prime.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.900
Now that's what
I'm talking about,

10:50.900 --> 10:52.777
great practice today, boys.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.320
We'll see you all
in a few hours.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.074
Oh, uh... right.
One more thing.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.243
As most of you already know,
tomorrow starts

11:00.243 --> 11:03.163
the long-standing
Fighting Trout tradition.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.415
We'll be hosting a series
of holiday events

11:05.415 --> 11:09.377
for the community, leading up
to the big jamboree.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.171
Gus is handing out
the schedules.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.424
And as always I expect all
of you to be your kindest,

11:14.424 --> 11:16.259
most courteous selves,

11:16.259 --> 11:18.511
and hopefully we'll have a
little fun in the process.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.055
Uh, hey Coach.

11:21.431 --> 11:26.603
Um... no offense, I'm... I'm not
much of a holiday guy.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.814
Any chance I could just get more
rink time while you guys are out

11:29.814 --> 11:33.818
singing carols and handing out
candy canes to the locals?

11:33.818 --> 11:37.280
Those locals come out
and support us all year long.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.532
And they happen to be paying
your salary at the moment.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.826
So, I don't think
it's too much to ask

11:41.826 --> 11:44.329
to show a little gratitude.

11:44.329 --> 11:47.415
I just wanna show gratitude
by playing my tail off

11:47.415 --> 11:48.750
out on the rink.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.628
Briggs...

11:51.628 --> 11:54.381
every player who walks
through my door

11:54.381 --> 11:58.343
has the exact same goal as you,
to get the heck outta here.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.387
But guess what?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.056
Nobody gets to Boise
unless I put 'em on the ice

12:03.056 --> 12:04.599
and I don't put nobody
on the ice

12:04.599 --> 12:07.102
unless they can act like
a part of this team.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.147
I don't care who their dad is.

12:11.147 --> 12:15.276
Now... do you wanna be a part
of this team or not?

12:24.285 --> 12:25.161
Yes.

12:25.787 --> 12:26.913
Good answer.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.417
Now hit the showers,
you guys stink!

12:35.046 --> 12:39.134
After tax that will be...
$57.23.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.305
Oh, sorry.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.937
I can help pay for that
if you're struggling, dear.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.940
Oh, uh... no.
No, that's okay.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.943
I... I promise I'm very
financially responsible.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.820
Is that why you're using
a card with the name

12:58.820 --> 13:00.405
Scott Briggs on it?

13:00.405 --> 13:02.032
What? Let me see that.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.575
Sorry. Since it's not your card

13:03.575 --> 13:04.951
I have to hold onto this
for now.

13:04.951 --> 13:08.204
Uh... okay. Well look,
I... I'm sorry.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.166
I have no idea
who Scott Briggs is.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.462
Yes, I do.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.632
Yeah. I do.
It's the guy from the airport.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.010
It's the guy from the airport.
The woman switched our cards.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.471
She switched our cards.

13:24.471 --> 13:28.558
Great. That'll be $57.23.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.268
I have $1.50.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.354
Can any of you help out
this poor, young woman?

13:34.856 --> 13:36.483
You know what?
It's fine.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.487
Who's next?

13:41.446 --> 13:42.572
Hi.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.328
Wow, you guys...

13:48.328 --> 13:49.913
you guys really like to fill up
before a big game, huh?

13:49.913 --> 13:51.039
Thanks for buying, Scott.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.123
Yeah.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.333
Well, you know, I didn't
really make

13:53.333 --> 13:54.834
the best first impression
back there.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.127
So I wanna show you all

13:56.127 --> 13:58.546
that I am in fact a stand-up,
decent guy.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.256
This isn't your debit card.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.217
What?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.386
It says Ashley Derrieux on it.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.098
I don't know an
Ashley Derrieux.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.933
And yet you have
her debit card.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.646
The woman!

14:14.646 --> 14:16.773
Uh, the woman at
the airport must've...

14:16.773 --> 14:18.692
she must've mixed up
the cards.

14:18.692 --> 14:19.609
Ah.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.154
Can any of you boys pay
for this?

14:24.739 --> 14:27.117
Well, hold on.
I... guys...

14:27.951 --> 14:30.912
Well, maybe I...
guys, don't...

14:30.912 --> 14:32.831
Okay, you know, well I'll get
the next one.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.332
How about that, huh?

14:34.332 --> 14:36.626
I'll... I'll... I'll get
the next one.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.461
It's on me next time.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.046
Could happen to anybody.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.173
It should be a fun game tonight.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.036
<i>Here comes...
he's cutting in.</i>

15:11.036 --> 15:13.580
<i>... oh, struck down by Cairns.</i>

15:13.580 --> 15:17.751
<i>That's going to be a replay
at center ice, a penalty shot.</i>

15:17.751 --> 15:22.047
<i>Cairns get's a penalty
shot with 59 seconds
left in the third period.</i>

15:22.047 --> 15:25.425
<i>This is a big moment for Idaho.
Let's see what happens.</i>

15:41.316 --> 15:44.444
<i>And it's no good.
No goal for the Trouts.</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:50.617
Briggs. Your line's up.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.160
Let's go.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.746
Well... how's it feel
to be back

15:54.746 --> 15:57.123
in the old Trout pond, honey?

15:58.041 --> 16:00.293
You know, it's actually
not bad.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.296
I've been dealing with real
estate sharks for so long

16:03.296 --> 16:07.634
that it's just nice to be around
kind, normal people.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.594
Hey! Come on, ref!

16:09.594 --> 16:10.762
I've got cataracts in both eyes

16:10.762 --> 16:14.391
and I could see that high stick
from here!

16:16.518 --> 16:18.978
Phew. I had to go to three
different concession stands

16:18.978 --> 16:21.106
but here are your
peppermint teas.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.857
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.026
Well... it's not every night

16:25.026 --> 16:27.487
I get to watch a game
with the whole family.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.030
Um... where's mine?

16:29.030 --> 16:31.658
Honey, I'm pretty sure Dave's
got you covered there.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.868
Oh, thanks Dave.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.829
Oh, did you guys
want something too?

16:35.829 --> 16:36.705
Yeah.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.417
So, Mom says you lost
your debit card at the airport?

16:40.417 --> 16:41.626
No, no, no.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.420
I didn't lose it, it got
switched with a guy

16:43.420 --> 16:44.254
at the gift shop.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.130
Well, did you get his name?

16:45.130 --> 16:47.382
Yes, Briggs. Scott Briggs.

16:47.966 --> 16:51.136
In fact, he said he's playing
for the Trouts.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.768
Wait. Wait, that's him!

17:00.395 --> 17:03.565
Hey! Hey! Hey!

17:03.565 --> 17:05.108
You have my debit card!

17:05.108 --> 17:06.608
Hey, you have my debit card!

17:06.608 --> 17:08.236
Meet me after the game!

17:08.236 --> 17:09.154
What?

17:09.154 --> 17:11.573
Meet me after the game!

17:11.573 --> 17:12.531
I can't hear you!

17:14.992 --> 17:15.785
Oh!

17:19.622 --> 17:23.042
Ooh. Yup, I think he got
the message.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.423
Obviously it's not
the result we wanted.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.675
Uh... we need to get the pucks
in the net and, you know,

17:30.675 --> 17:33.136
I need to be better on
the breakaways, you know.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.929
It's just, it is what it is.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.014
Oh, hi.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.182
Oh...

17:39.809 --> 17:42.896
Uh... I'm so sorry that I
distracted you back there.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.356
How's my face?

17:45.648 --> 17:46.816
I've seen better.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.693
Thanks.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.612
I'm Ashley, by the way.

17:50.612 --> 17:51.821
- Scott.
- Hi.

17:51.821 --> 17:52.947
Sorry about the mix up.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.240
Yeah.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.950
So where's my card?

17:57.577 --> 18:00.413
Ah, it's at the Drunken Puck.
Yeah, they kept your card.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.748
Oh.

18:01.748 --> 18:02.832
- So...
- Okay.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.293
Give me mine.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.504
Are those comfortable shoes?

18:08.463 --> 18:09.464
Why?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.299
We have to go
for a little walk.

18:15.804 --> 18:16.846
Ow.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.728
Okay. One card down,
one to go.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.855
Next stop is Chuck's
Christmas tree lot.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.235
So... what do you think
of your new town?

18:30.235 --> 18:32.696
Uh, my very temporary new town.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.322
Ah, yes.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.157
So sorry, I forgot it's just a
pit stop on your way to Boise.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.701
You got it.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.869
Well, what did you think
of your first game

18:39.869 --> 18:41.663
as a Fighting Trout?

18:41.663 --> 18:44.249
Well, besides the jet lag
and learning that I have

18:44.249 --> 18:46.334
to volunteer for an entire
week of Christmas...

18:46.334 --> 18:51.047
Christmas activities, I'd say
I played pretty well.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.173
Really?

18:52.173 --> 18:53.883
You had six shots on nets,

18:53.883 --> 18:57.429
scored zero goals and you had
a plus/minus of negative three.

18:57.429 --> 18:59.514
I mean, call me crazy
but I don't think the boys

18:59.514 --> 19:02.350
up in Boise would call
that playing pretty well.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.852
Why don't you tell me
what you really think?

19:03.852 --> 19:05.145
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.688
No, it's fine. I... I
appreciate the honesty.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.190
I just, I'm surprised you cared
that much to pay attention.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.775
Don't flatter yourself
too much.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.569
It's just something I picked up
after years of going to games

19:12.569 --> 19:13.653
with my dad.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.447
The plus/minus?

19:15.447 --> 19:16.698
I mean, nobody tracks that.

19:16.698 --> 19:18.324
Oh, I disagree.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.702
It shows how well the team
does when you're in the game,

19:20.702 --> 19:22.328
whether you make them
better or worse.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.165
And for me, that's the most
important stat there is.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.416
Alright, you know your hockey.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.793
Yeah, I used to have time
to be a fan.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.754
I mean, not so much anymore.

19:30.754 --> 19:32.464
It did look like you were
having fun to me.

19:32.464 --> 19:33.882
No.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.216
I was having fun with my family
but I can assure you,

19:35.216 --> 19:37.469
I was not enjoying a single
second of the game.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.554
Even when I smashed
my face in the ice?

19:39.554 --> 19:41.639
No. Yeah, that was
rather enjoyable.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.900
I promise you, it's his card.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.403
But how do I know it's his card
unless I see some photo ID?

19:55.403 --> 19:58.990
I told you, I left my wallet
in my locker.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.326
I know. It's quite a conundrum.

20:08.291 --> 20:12.545
Oh! Wait a second.
Here. This is his photo ID.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.840
Right here.
That's him. See?

20:15.840 --> 20:16.675
See?

20:18.176 --> 20:22.347
I didn't know you were a Trout.
My apologies, Mr. Briggs.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.683
Welcome to Idaho Falls.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.311
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.238
What was all that about?

20:38.238 --> 20:39.447
Well, what can I say?

20:39.447 --> 20:41.783
For some crazy reason,
people in this town

20:41.783 --> 20:43.952
actually respect
their hockey players.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.414
What do you do
in New York again?

20:47.414 --> 20:50.166
Uh... it's not
that interesting.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.418
Or you just don't think

20:51.418 --> 20:52.836
I'm gonna think
it's that interesting.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.089
I sell commercial real estate.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.508
Interesting.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.177
Like hotels and office
buildings, things like that?

21:01.177 --> 21:02.804
Exactly.

21:02.804 --> 21:06.349
And for the last two months I've
spent all my time and energy

21:06.349 --> 21:08.935
trying to land this client
with one of the biggest

21:08.935 --> 21:10.729
shopping centers in the city.

21:10.729 --> 21:11.563
Sounds cool.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.314
It would've been very cool.

21:13.314 --> 21:16.026
But at the last minute
they decided to hire

21:16.026 --> 21:17.235
my now ex-boyfriend.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.737
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

21:18.737 --> 21:20.905
I'm sorry if I haven't been
exactly cheery,

21:20.905 --> 21:23.158
it's just that it's been
a stressful couple of days.

21:23.158 --> 21:24.617
It's fine. Yeah.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.244
You know, it's a lot
like my life.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.704
Oh yeah? Try me.

21:27.704 --> 21:30.206
Well, for the last six months
I've been playing hockey

21:30.206 --> 21:31.207
for this team in Michigan.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.542
Mm-hmm.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.960
Trying to get called up
to the Red Wings.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.670
Some of the best hockey
I have played in my life.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.756
Week after week, some kid
with half the talent

21:37.756 --> 21:39.591
gets called up
because he's younger.

21:39.591 --> 21:40.759
So why don't you quit?

21:40.759 --> 21:42.385
I've been playing since
I was four.

21:42.385 --> 21:46.222
My dad was in the NHL but
it's never been an option.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.557
How do you keep yourself going?

21:47.557 --> 21:50.226
Well, you take the hit,

21:50.226 --> 21:53.480
you shake it off and
you get back out there.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.814
If you do that over
and over again,

21:54.814 --> 21:58.568
eventually you're gonna get
where you wanna go.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.111
That was a good pep talk.

22:00.111 --> 22:01.988
It helps when you say it
every morning in the mirror.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.407
Oh.

22:06.409 --> 22:11.206
Well... it's been a very
interesting evening.

22:11.206 --> 22:14.751
I'm glad you got your card back
and good luck in Idaho Falls.

22:14.751 --> 22:15.919
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.426
Hey. Um...

22:25.303 --> 22:26.680
You mind if we share the cab?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.516
It's... it's kinda late.
You do kinda owe me one.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.101
I do? How do I owe you?

22:31.101 --> 22:34.104
I humiliated myself in front
of my teammates using your card.

22:34.104 --> 22:35.689
I humiliated myself

22:35.689 --> 22:38.108
trying to use your card
in my home town!

22:40.568 --> 22:43.071
Yeah. Sure.
Yeah. Yeah.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.698
Thank you. Here.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.450
Thank you.

22:53.206 --> 22:56.835
845 Deerfield Court.
Wait. That's where I live.

22:56.835 --> 22:57.919
Are you
following me?

22:59.129 --> 23:00.338
That's my parents' house.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.257
I'm staying in
the guest cottage.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.133
You're paying!

23:09.139 --> 23:12.267
That's right, just take
the hit, shake it off...

23:12.267 --> 23:13.601
get back on the ice.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.812
Take the hit, shake it off,
get back on the ice.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.148
Okay.

23:18.773 --> 23:20.984
You got this.
You got this, girl.

23:23.778 --> 23:25.238
Hi!

23:25.238 --> 23:27.032
Donna, this is Ashley Derrieux
over at Atlas Real Estate.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.366
How are you?

23:28.366 --> 23:30.910
I am looking at your property
on East 37th.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.121
Brian! Hi. Listen...

23:33.121 --> 23:35.123
Anyway, just thought I'd call
and see if you had

23:35.123 --> 23:36.583
any irons in the fire.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.710
Call me when you get this,
I'll be around any time.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.503
Well, if anything comes up,

23:40.503 --> 23:43.214
please don't hesitate
to give me a call. Okay?

23:43.214 --> 23:46.426
Happy holidays.

23:46.426 --> 23:47.594
Yeah, happy holidays.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.478
Well, you certainly
got up early.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.271
Yeah, I'm sorry
if I was too loud.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.564
Not at all.

23:59.564 --> 24:00.607
You look very nice.
What's the occasion?

24:00.607 --> 24:02.776
It's my Cider Social dress.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.904
Oh, right.
Getting ready.

24:05.904 --> 24:06.654
Good.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.552
Can I help you?

24:29.552 --> 24:32.055
Uh, yeah. I'm... I'm one of
the hockey players.

24:32.055 --> 24:34.057
Briggs, right?

24:34.057 --> 24:35.058
Yeah, that's right.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.476
You're staying at
our guest house.

24:36.476 --> 24:39.062
I'm James Derrieux,
nice to finally meet you.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.814
Nice to meet you too.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.901
No one told me that I had
to dress up for this.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.904
Listen, you don't happen to sell
sports goods here, do you?

24:49.614 --> 24:50.740
Follow me.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.746
This place is basically
my second home.

24:56.746 --> 24:59.416
I'm sure I'll be able to find
something for you.

24:59.416 --> 25:02.877
Ah... let's see.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.337
No, no.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.255
Ah!

25:06.881 --> 25:10.969
This hasn't fit me for years
but I'm sure it'll work for you.

25:10.969 --> 25:12.303
Thank you.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.930
Hey, you're a part of
the Fighting Trout family.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.266
That makes you a part of
the Derrieux family now too.

25:17.434 --> 25:21.062
Oh. Don't forget your hat.

25:21.062 --> 25:21.938
Uh...

25:21.938 --> 25:24.315
Merry Christmas.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.539
Okay. What'd I miss?

25:39.539 --> 25:41.166
Oh, well...

25:41.166 --> 25:42.751
they just crowned
little Abigail this year's

25:42.751 --> 25:47.255
Cider Social princess and little
Annie-Sue is not happy about it.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.135
What am I supposed
to do?

25:52.135 --> 25:56.348
Oh! Well, you pick up
the cider...

25:56.348 --> 25:57.390
Yeah.

25:57.390 --> 25:58.683
Like this.

25:58.683 --> 26:01.561
And then you politely
approach the table

26:01.561 --> 26:04.397
and you pour it
into their cups.

26:06.107 --> 26:07.984
Okay. I can do that.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.569
Ah, what... what table?

26:13.323 --> 26:14.199
Oh.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.409
And always remember to smile.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.411
Okay.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.042
Good morning, ladies.

26:24.042 --> 26:26.086
Mr. Briggs, looking rather
dapper today.

26:26.086 --> 26:28.004
Thank you, Miss Derrieux.

26:28.004 --> 26:30.757
So, this is the famous
debit card thief.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.177
Pleasure to meet you.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.929
Can I offer anyone here
some cider?

26:35.929 --> 26:38.223
Yes please.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.182
Alright.

26:40.934 --> 26:43.186
There you are.

26:43.186 --> 26:46.064
Don't forget Mr. Wiggles.

26:46.064 --> 26:49.567
How could I forget Mr. Wiggles?
There we are.

26:51.069 --> 26:53.488
Now, can you do me a favor?

26:53.488 --> 26:57.242
And can you let Mr. Wiggles
know that this cider is hot

26:57.242 --> 27:00.036
and it should sit for a moment
before he drinks it.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.164
Thank you.

27:03.164 --> 27:05.208
Um... are we all good?

27:05.208 --> 27:06.376
Mm-hmm.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.627
Perfect, thank you.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.048
Well... he seems sweet.

27:13.216 --> 27:15.427
He's wearing Dad's jacket.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.513
So? Dave used to borrow Dad's
clothes all the time.

27:18.513 --> 27:21.099
Yeah, and Dave gave you rubber
worms for your anniversary.

27:21.099 --> 27:23.018
Because he knows I don't like
to put the real ones

27:23.018 --> 27:24.144
on the hook.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.270
Mm-hmm.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.107
I think what Ashley is trying
to say is that she has

27:29.107 --> 27:31.276
a perfectly suitable man
in her life

27:31.276 --> 27:34.029
that we will all be meeting
very soon.

27:34.029 --> 27:35.238
Isn't that right?

27:36.531 --> 27:37.782
Yup.

27:37.782 --> 27:40.285
So, now we can all enjoy
this rare time

27:40.285 --> 27:42.245
that we get to spend together.

27:47.834 --> 27:50.628
Looks like someone's finally
got that warm and fuzzy feeling.

27:50.628 --> 27:51.588
Huh?

27:51.588 --> 27:52.881
What?

27:52.881 --> 27:54.215
Well, you said
you're not a holiday guy,

27:54.215 --> 27:56.760
but I can see that Christmas
twinkle in your eye.

27:58.678 --> 28:00.138
It's not a twinkle.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.891
It's a tear because
the longer we're here,

28:02.891 --> 28:04.142
the less time
we're at practice.

28:04.142 --> 28:06.394
We can practice any time.

28:06.394 --> 28:07.812
This only comes around
once a year.

28:07.812 --> 28:08.813
My time's running out.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.023
So if I want to get moved up,

28:10.023 --> 28:12.150
it has to happen,
like... yesterday.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.861
I'm behind schedule, okay?

28:14.861 --> 28:18.615
So... if we could just
get these crumpets out,

28:18.615 --> 28:20.075
we could get back to work.

28:21.826 --> 28:23.119
Wow.

28:23.119 --> 28:26.164
You sure know how to ruin
a cider social.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.054
Well, that was lovely.

28:41.054 --> 28:43.098
I have some last-minute
shopping to do.

28:43.098 --> 28:44.557
Anyone interested in joining me?

28:44.557 --> 28:46.017
Oh...

28:46.017 --> 28:47.727
I told Becca that I would go
see her new office

28:47.727 --> 28:49.020
but I'll see you guys later.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.480
Oh. Have fun, sweetie.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.523
I will. I love you.

28:51.523 --> 28:52.732
Love you.

28:52.732 --> 28:53.566
- Ready?
- Yeah.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.651
Let's go.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.822
Uh huh. Oh, perfect.

28:58.822 --> 29:00.240
Okay, I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

29:01.282 --> 29:02.534
Bye.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.537
Hey! Look at you.
Making deals, taking names.

29:05.537 --> 29:06.454
Hi.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.707
Um... okay.

29:08.707 --> 29:10.375
I am so sorry, I know
this is last minute

29:10.375 --> 29:12.127
but I have to go show
this house real quick.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.378
That's okay, that's fine.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.337
Okay.

29:15.588 --> 29:18.383
Hey... you wouldn't wanna come
with, would you?

29:18.383 --> 29:19.926
Oh...

29:19.926 --> 29:22.053
It's... it's just that I get
so nervous at these showings

29:22.053 --> 29:24.931
and I know how experienced
you are.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.517
Christmas manis on me
if you come.

29:27.517 --> 29:29.686
Well, you've clearly got
the negotiating part down.

29:29.686 --> 29:30.603
I'm sold.

29:30.603 --> 29:31.813
You are the best.

29:35.233 --> 29:36.609
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

29:39.279 --> 29:42.198
And, uh, this is
the family room.

29:43.950 --> 29:47.620
This is charming, Becca.
How many bathrooms does it have?

29:47.620 --> 29:49.497
Um... 35.

29:50.123 --> 29:55.253
Wait! No. Uh... three
point five.

29:55.253 --> 29:57.213
There's a period.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.798
You know, it's a good size.

29:58.798 --> 30:02.052
I just wish you could see the
lake as soon as you walked in.

30:02.052 --> 30:05.263
Um... yes.
Uh... that would be great.

30:05.263 --> 30:07.557
You know, there's a really
easy fix for that.

30:07.557 --> 30:08.433
Is that so?

30:08.433 --> 30:09.434
Oh yeah, yeah.

30:09.434 --> 30:12.270
If you take out
this wall here,

30:12.270 --> 30:15.398
it would open everything up
and then you would have

30:15.398 --> 30:19.235
this beautiful view
as soon as you walk in.

30:19.235 --> 30:23.239
I mean...
look at those mountains.

30:23.239 --> 30:25.492
That would be perfect actually.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.577
And, you know, I love

30:27.577 --> 30:30.538
the original hardwood
floors out here.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.707
I just wish it matched
the kitchen.

30:32.707 --> 30:34.250
Um... you know,

30:34.250 --> 30:37.420
my uncle actually has a flooring
business in town.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.465
Uh, he could match any hardwood
you find here

30:40.465 --> 30:43.510
and we could get you
a great price too.

30:46.179 --> 30:48.139
I think this could work
for us, Rex.

30:48.139 --> 30:49.599
I think so too.

31:08.410 --> 31:09.577
Sorry.

31:09.577 --> 31:10.912
Hey, Zetner.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.831
Maybe if you aim for the stands
you'd hit the net.

31:16.710 --> 31:17.544
Hey!

31:18.545 --> 31:20.005
You want some unsolicited
advice?

31:20.005 --> 31:21.423
At this point
I'll take anything.

31:21.423 --> 31:22.841
You're holding the stick
too tight.

31:22.841 --> 31:24.801
Loosen up a bit, yeah.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.263
Now with your wrist I want you
to turn the blade.

31:29.764 --> 31:30.724
Yeah.

31:31.558 --> 31:32.767
Now shoot.

31:32.767 --> 31:33.810
Here goes nothing.

31:37.772 --> 31:38.606
Hey!

31:39.691 --> 31:40.734
Thanks Scott.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.208
Alright, boys.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.961
We've got two days to turn this
place into a winter wonderland.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.338
Let's get to it.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.341
Hey pops.

32:05.342 --> 32:06.634
Yeah, what do you want, Pierre?

32:08.595 --> 32:11.514
Can I, uh... talk to you
for a second?

32:17.437 --> 32:25.111
I saw what you did with Zetner
and I was, um...

32:25.111 --> 32:26.571
wondering if...

32:26.571 --> 32:28.156
If you could get some help
on your breakaways.

32:28.156 --> 32:29.240
You know?

32:29.240 --> 32:30.742
Yeah, everyone knows.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.410
That's why you haven't been
called up to Boise yet.

32:32.410 --> 32:35.413
It's those one-on-ones.
I always seem to miss high.

32:35.413 --> 32:37.248
That's 'cause you're
full of adrenaline.

32:37.248 --> 32:39.209
You freeze up.
You need to breathe.

32:39.209 --> 32:40.710
I think I know how to breathe.

32:40.710 --> 32:44.506
Well then try it but slowly.
Through your nose.

32:45.632 --> 32:49.094
Okay. Thanks.
I'll give it a try.

32:49.094 --> 32:52.138
Guys!
Come on, back to work.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.515
Um...

32:58.186 --> 33:01.189
I think you might've just
helped me sell my first house.

33:01.731 --> 33:03.900
This is the perfect way
to celebrate.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.193
Teamwork makes
the dream work.

33:05.193 --> 33:06.653
Oh yeah.

33:06.653 --> 33:08.279
No wonder you're doing
so well out there.

33:08.279 --> 33:12.659
Eh... it's really not as
exciting as you think it is.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.577
What? I thought you loved it
out there.

33:14.577 --> 33:18.581
I did. At first.

33:18.581 --> 33:21.376
I really loved the people
and the sounds of the city

33:21.376 --> 33:23.545
and the thrill of being anywhere
but here.

33:23.545 --> 33:24.671
Oh, that makes sense.

33:24.671 --> 33:27.048
Yeah, but lately I don't know.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.633
I keep getting passed
over by clients

33:28.633 --> 33:31.386
who would rather be wined
and dined at a golf course.

33:31.386 --> 33:32.470
What about Trevor?

33:32.470 --> 33:33.805
Trevor...

33:35.682 --> 33:36.766
I broke up with him.

33:36.766 --> 33:38.184
What?

33:38.184 --> 33:39.644
When did this happen?

33:39.644 --> 33:40.770
The day I landed.

33:40.770 --> 33:41.980
Why?

33:41.980 --> 33:43.732
I... I thought everything
was going great.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.400
And then as soon as I invited
him home for Christmas

33:45.400 --> 33:48.570
to meet my family he turned into
every other self-centered jerk

33:48.570 --> 33:50.363
I've dated in
the last five years.

33:50.363 --> 33:53.158
Jeez.
What did your parents say?

33:53.158 --> 33:54.951
I haven't told them.

33:54.951 --> 33:57.328
Ashley, you have to tell them.

33:57.328 --> 33:59.122
I know, I will.
I will tell them.

33:59.122 --> 33:59.998
Mmhmm.

34:00.749 --> 34:02.751
It's just, I always do this.

34:02.751 --> 34:04.878
I... I make a big deal
about a guy,

34:04.878 --> 34:09.674
thinking that he's perfect and
how he could be the one, and...

34:09.674 --> 34:12.635
I just really hate feeling
like I'm letting them down.

34:12.635 --> 34:14.596
Please. Your parents
aren't gonna care.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.848
They're, like, the sweetest
people in Idaho Falls.

34:16.848 --> 34:18.350
They are the sweetest people

34:18.350 --> 34:21.770
and that is what makes it
so hard to give them bad news.

34:23.396 --> 34:25.190
Look...

34:25.190 --> 34:28.610
You broke up with your boyfriend
and you lost one client.

34:28.610 --> 34:30.445
You will bounce back.

34:30.445 --> 34:31.279
How do you know?

34:31.279 --> 34:32.781
I just do.

34:32.781 --> 34:35.074
You know, any day now some
new client is gonna call

34:35.074 --> 34:37.243
looking for the amazing
Ashley Derrieux

34:37.243 --> 34:39.913
and you won't even remember
what you were down about.

34:41.498 --> 34:42.456
Thank you.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.000
You're welcome.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.920
Come on. With these sparkly
beauties on your fingers...

34:46.920 --> 34:48.838
I would say you're bouncing
back already.

34:48.838 --> 34:49.880
Yeah.

34:51.091 --> 34:51.966
Do they bring out the sparkle
in my eyes?

34:51.966 --> 34:53.967
They really do,
you're glowing.

34:59.516 --> 35:01.768
Briggs! Hey, Briggs!

35:01.768 --> 35:02.977
I'm locking up here.

35:02.977 --> 35:05.730
Gus! Come on,
30 more minutes.

35:05.730 --> 35:07.107
I'm trying to get to Boise.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.650
And I'm trying to get home
to get my wife's

35:08.650 --> 35:12.237
homemade Christmas fudge
before the grandkids eat it.

35:12.237 --> 35:14.531
Look, there's a public
rink on the edge of town

35:14.531 --> 35:16.866
if you need to get your fix in.

35:28.670 --> 35:29.838
I pick Cameron.

35:29.838 --> 35:31.715
Oh man, you always
pick Cameron.

35:31.715 --> 35:33.049
And we always kick
your butt.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.891
I pick him.

35:41.891 --> 35:43.184
Hey you!

35:44.936 --> 35:46.062
What?

35:49.774 --> 35:52.902
Hey. Do you know how
to play hockey?

35:52.902 --> 35:55.530
According to the head coach
of the Grand Rapid Griffins...

35:55.530 --> 35:56.698
No.

35:56.698 --> 35:58.992
Well, you're on our team.
Come on.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.118
What?

36:00.118 --> 36:02.495
I'm Parker.
I picked you for my team.

36:02.495 --> 36:05.290
If you don't know how to play,
just follow my lead.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.541
Just follow your lead?

36:06.541 --> 36:07.751
Come on!

36:23.558 --> 36:25.435
You're going down again, Parker.

36:38.490 --> 36:40.033
Is that all you got?

36:50.085 --> 36:51.294
Yeah!

36:56.049 --> 36:58.426
Next one wins, which means
you lose again.

37:08.436 --> 37:11.189
- Yeah!
- Woohoo!

37:11.189 --> 37:12.941
Yeah!

37:16.861 --> 37:18.321
I get him tomorrow.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.408
Alright. So what
you're gonna do

37:21.408 --> 37:24.160
is present the puck to the
defender, then drag it around.

37:26.204 --> 37:28.498
- Put it in.
- Can I try?

37:28.498 --> 37:29.916
Yeah. Yeah.

37:33.253 --> 37:34.295
Like this?

37:37.674 --> 37:38.550
Nice!

37:38.550 --> 37:40.051
Yeah.

37:40.051 --> 37:41.094
Hey, where was that move
in last night's game?

37:41.094 --> 37:43.471
Hey!
What are you doing here?

37:43.471 --> 37:44.931
I'm picking up my nephew.

37:44.931 --> 37:46.975
Aunt Ashley,
come for a skate.

37:46.975 --> 37:48.810
Alright, fine.
I'm coming out.

37:48.810 --> 37:51.104
But if I break a nail,
you're buying.

38:00.864 --> 38:03.450
- So, Parker's a pretty good kid?
- Yeah.

38:03.450 --> 38:04.492
Great hockey player.

38:04.492 --> 38:05.994
Yeah, he's really sweet.

38:05.994 --> 38:08.163
And Julie and Dave,
they never miss a game.

38:08.163 --> 38:10.790
It's kind of a... a big
to-do in the family.

38:10.790 --> 38:12.125
Lucky kid.

38:14.085 --> 38:15.920
Did your parents not come
to your game?

38:15.920 --> 38:17.505
Well, my mom did.

38:17.505 --> 38:20.425
But she passed when I was 10
so it was just me and my dad.

38:20.425 --> 38:21.593
When you're in the NHL

38:21.593 --> 38:23.303
your career sorta takes
your priority.

38:23.303 --> 38:26.556
So, he never coached
your team or anything?

38:28.224 --> 38:31.895
Those that can't play, coach.
His favorite saying.

38:33.396 --> 38:34.564
Okay.

38:34.564 --> 38:35.815
Well still, he must've taught
you something.

38:35.815 --> 38:37.275
Yeah. He taught me that to make
it in hockey

38:37.275 --> 38:38.693
you can't be distracted
by anything.

38:38.693 --> 38:39.569
Mm.

38:40.737 --> 38:42.489
Even your family.

38:42.489 --> 38:43.907
Yeah, I relate to that.

38:44.991 --> 38:46.618
Why, what do you mean?

38:46.618 --> 38:48.078
Yeah. I mean,

38:48.078 --> 38:49.704
I've spent the last five years
trying to build this

38:49.704 --> 38:56.211
perfect life and career in New
York and I have not given myself

38:56.211 --> 38:58.296
a lot of spare time to come
back home and visit.

39:01.049 --> 39:02.634
So then why don't you
just move back?

39:03.551 --> 39:05.220
To Idaho Falls?

39:05.220 --> 39:06.513
Yeah.

39:06.513 --> 39:08.431
I mean, can't you just sell
real estate here?

39:08.431 --> 39:10.225
It might not be as prestigious
as New York

39:10.225 --> 39:12.143
but I'm sure you could make
a living.

39:12.143 --> 39:13.937
I wish it were that simple.

39:15.271 --> 39:16.439
Why isn't it?

39:17.982 --> 39:19.609
I... I don't know.

39:21.695 --> 39:23.780
I mean, my parents sacrificed
a lot

39:23.780 --> 39:26.574
just for me to get out
of this town.

39:26.574 --> 39:28.827
You know, while all of their
friends were busy going

39:28.827 --> 39:31.329
on big cruises and buying
luxury RVs,

39:31.329 --> 39:35.417
they spent their entire savings
on my college fund.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.085
They even paid for
my first apartment

39:37.085 --> 39:39.379
before the commission checks
were coming in.

39:39.379 --> 39:42.090
That's all good and well, but
I mean, if you're not happy...

39:44.843 --> 39:46.344
What about you?

39:46.344 --> 39:48.555
You know, I mean, don't you get
tired of moving around

39:48.555 --> 39:50.140
all the time?

39:50.140 --> 39:53.476
Chasing big dreams but never
having a place to call home?

39:53.476 --> 39:54.477
I'm different.

39:54.477 --> 39:55.478
Why?

39:56.980 --> 39:58.940
Because I never had
what you have.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.526
Our family was never together.

40:01.526 --> 40:03.987
No, this... this has always
been my safe space.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.115
I always felt at home
on the ice.

40:22.964 --> 40:25.133
Just breathe.

40:25.133 --> 40:28.470
<i>And Pierre Chaison
will take the penalty
shot for the Trouts.</i>

40:33.850 --> 40:34.976
<i>Can he put
the Trout in the lead?</i>

40:44.194 --> 40:45.987
That's how you do it?

40:52.118 --> 40:52.994
Hey.

40:54.871 --> 40:56.081
Nice shot, kid.

40:56.081 --> 40:57.374
Thanks pops.

41:00.585 --> 41:02.170
I overheard Coach on the phone.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.089
I think someone in Boise
got hurt.

41:04.089 --> 41:05.548
They're gonna bring
one of us up.

41:05.548 --> 41:06.966
No, we'd have heard
about an injury.

41:08.051 --> 41:08.968
Gus!

41:08.968 --> 41:10.053
Yeah?

41:10.053 --> 41:11.096
Did somebody in Boise
get hurt?

41:11.096 --> 41:12.806
Yeah, Walker,
about two hours ago.

41:12.806 --> 41:15.183
Separated his shoulder, he'll
be out for a couple of months.

41:15.183 --> 41:16.351
Walker plays right wing.

41:16.351 --> 41:18.019
You play right wing.

41:18.019 --> 41:19.229
I remember.

41:19.229 --> 41:21.773
Briggs. Come see me
in my office.

41:31.032 --> 41:32.117
Scott.

41:32.117 --> 41:33.034
Hey.

41:36.746 --> 41:38.581
Ty Walker in Boise separated
his shoulder

41:38.581 --> 41:40.083
against the Bobcats.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.210
Yeah. I... I heard.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.379
They need a new right wing.

41:44.379 --> 41:46.965
Coach, um...

41:46.965 --> 41:49.009
I just wanna say how much
I appreciate this.

41:49.009 --> 41:49.968
I am...

41:49.968 --> 41:51.011
They're calling up Zetner.

41:53.638 --> 41:54.472
What?

41:54.472 --> 41:56.725
Zetner is moving up to Boise.

41:56.725 --> 41:57.684
Zetner?

41:57.684 --> 41:58.810
Mmhmm.

41:58.810 --> 41:59.853
I had to teach him how
to keep the puck

41:59.853 --> 42:01.146
from killing half
our fan base.

42:01.146 --> 42:03.314
What... why, why Zetner?

42:03.314 --> 42:05.233
Because he's a lot faster
than you.

42:05.233 --> 42:06.985
Look, I know it's disappointing

42:06.985 --> 42:10.113
but the big club isn't looking
for 32-year-old rookies.

42:11.573 --> 42:13.491
But I want you to know
that I see the way

42:13.491 --> 42:14.826
you've been helping out
the younger guys.

42:14.826 --> 42:16.953
Yeah. So I can help
them move up.

42:18.329 --> 42:20.457
There's one more thing.

42:20.457 --> 42:21.374
You're cutting me.

42:21.374 --> 42:22.667
No.

42:22.667 --> 42:23.835
Zetner was supposed to coach

42:23.835 --> 42:26.129
the kids' Christmas hockey
game tomorrow.

42:26.129 --> 42:28.048
I need you to step in.

42:28.048 --> 42:29.132
- Seriously?
- Mmhmm.

42:30.800 --> 42:34.554
Uh... I don't know anything
about coaching a bunch of kids.

42:34.554 --> 42:36.097
You taught Pierre
how to actually score

42:36.097 --> 42:37.849
on the penalty shot.

42:37.849 --> 42:39.976
I'm sure you can handle
a pee-wee hockey game.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.106
Wow. Are these all
for Parker?

42:45.106 --> 42:47.317
No, no. Just some donations
for the jamboree.

42:47.317 --> 42:48.902
Oh. Oh!

42:48.902 --> 42:50.737
Grandma's donating
a family scarf?

42:50.737 --> 42:53.448
Oh, no. She made that
for Trevor.

42:53.448 --> 42:54.783
Did he get his flights
figured out?

42:54.783 --> 42:57.327
We only have a few days
'till Christmas.

42:57.327 --> 42:58.495
Uh...

43:00.121 --> 43:01.873
Oh honey, what's the matter?
Is the coffee too bland?

43:01.873 --> 43:05.085
No! No, no, no.
No, the coffee's fine.

43:05.085 --> 43:06.002
Um...

43:07.796 --> 43:11.466
No, it's Trevor.
He's not coming.

43:11.466 --> 43:13.176
Oh. Well that's alright, sweetie.

43:13.176 --> 43:15.804
I mean, there's always
next year.

43:15.804 --> 43:19.974
No, he probably won't come
next year either.

43:19.974 --> 43:20.767
Oh.

43:22.060 --> 43:24.020
I'm so sorry, I should've told
you guys sooner.

43:24.020 --> 43:26.022
I just...

43:26.022 --> 43:29.484
I don't know. Julie has Dave,
and you two have each other,

43:29.484 --> 43:31.569
and I just thought that this
would finally be

43:31.569 --> 43:36.366
a perfect Christmas where
I bring someone home and...

43:36.366 --> 43:37.909
and when it all fell apart, I...

43:40.995 --> 43:43.206
I don't know, I just felt
very embarrassed.

43:43.206 --> 43:44.916
Oh, Ashley.

43:44.916 --> 43:46.876
We don't need some hot shot,
who clearly is not good enough

43:46.876 --> 43:49.170
for our daughter, to make it
a perfect Christmas.

43:49.170 --> 43:52.841
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm a bit relieved.

43:52.841 --> 43:54.259
You are?

43:54.259 --> 43:56.261
I didn't like this Trevor
fellow from the beginning.

43:56.261 --> 43:58.138
Dad, you never even met him.

43:58.138 --> 44:00.557
That's why I didn't like him.

44:00.557 --> 44:03.935
You ask me, you dodged a real
bullet with this one.

44:07.897 --> 44:09.691
Thanks guys.

44:12.110 --> 44:13.903
<i>As always

44:13.903 --> 44:17.157

44:19.367 --> 44:20.618
Hey, you made it!

44:20.618 --> 44:22.287
Yeah, I made it.

44:22.287 --> 44:23.872
Where's Dave?

44:23.872 --> 44:25.707
He's not allowed within 50 feet
of the referee anymore.

44:32.213 --> 44:33.631
Forget Dave.

44:33.631 --> 44:34.841
It's the new coach you should
be worried about.

44:37.093 --> 44:38.678
What? Scott's coaching?

44:38.678 --> 44:40.347
More like nervously pacing.

44:41.598 --> 44:42.932
Hey, rookie!

44:44.059 --> 44:45.393
Hey!

44:45.393 --> 44:47.854
How are you doing?
You look a little pale.

44:47.854 --> 44:49.439
Well, they threw me
into this last minute.

44:49.439 --> 44:52.108
I... I have no idea
what I'm doing.

44:53.109 --> 44:55.779
Okay.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.197
You remember how you told me
your dad was never around

44:57.197 --> 44:58.656
to coach you?

44:58.656 --> 45:00.658
Bringing up my absentee father
right now, is...

45:00.658 --> 45:02.702
it's not helping.

45:02.702 --> 45:04.996
Just be the coach
you wanted him to be.

45:07.957 --> 45:09.000
You got this.

45:14.214 --> 45:16.424

Yeah, must have something
to do with the coach.

48:16.104 --> 48:18.273
Pretty easy when you got
a player like Parker.

48:18.273 --> 48:19.774
He's quite the athlete.

48:19.774 --> 48:21.609

48:33.246 --> 48:36.124
I know you, you said that you
feel more at home on the ice.

48:36.124 --> 48:38.043
But we're... we're headed back

48:38.043 --> 48:42.339
to our actual home to have
dinner if you'd like to join?

48:42.339 --> 48:44.632
Might be more fun than reading
old copies of Sports Illustrated

48:44.632 --> 48:46.760
in the guest house.

48:46.760 --> 48:47.886
Have you been spying on me?

48:47.886 --> 48:49.804
Well... it was either that

48:49.804 --> 48:52.098
or old Stanley Cup highlights
on YouTube.

48:55.060 --> 48:57.228
So, do you wanna come
to dinner or what?

49:00.357 --> 49:01.316
Sure.

49:01.316 --> 49:02.025
You do?

49:02.025 --> 49:02.942
Yeah.

49:03.610 --> 49:04.861
I mean, a guy's gotta eat.

49:04.861 --> 49:06.071
Yeah. Yeah.

49:17.248 --> 49:18.958
Okay, so... just a heads up.

49:18.958 --> 49:22.212
After dinner my grandma is going
to offer you eggnog.

49:22.212 --> 49:23.505
Just say no.

49:24.214 --> 49:25.799
Why? I love eggnog.

49:25.799 --> 49:28.218
Oh, I love eggnog too
but this is no eggnog.

49:28.218 --> 49:32.389
No, no, no.
No, this is a witch's brew.

49:32.389 --> 49:34.516
I'm no expert for family dinners
but if somebody

49:34.516 --> 49:36.726
offers me something, I think
it'd be rude to say no.

49:36.726 --> 49:40.021
Trust me. If you drink it,
you will regret it.

49:42.107 --> 49:43.400
I'll be fine.

49:45.026 --> 49:46.277
Okay.

49:47.487 --> 49:49.698
I used to play a little puck
back in the day.

49:49.698 --> 49:53.535
If they ever need a right winger
to slap 'er like a rocket-ship,

49:53.535 --> 49:56.538
you tell them to give
old Dave a call.

49:56.538 --> 49:57.247
Oh!

49:57.247 --> 49:59.624
Oh, easy there Gretzky.

50:00.667 --> 50:02.544
Who's ready for some eggnog?

50:03.044 --> 50:03.920
Not me.

50:03.920 --> 50:04.713
I have to clean up.

50:04.713 --> 50:05.547
I'll help.

50:07.924 --> 50:09.009
Dave?

50:09.009 --> 50:10.802
Uh... sorry Stella,
I'm on a diet.

50:10.802 --> 50:12.637
Scott...

50:12.637 --> 50:14.973
You have to try
my homemade recipe.

50:14.973 --> 50:17.851
Um... okay.

50:17.851 --> 50:19.269
Ow!

50:19.269 --> 50:22.814
Uh... yow, yeah.
I'll try it, I mean.

50:22.814 --> 50:25.859
It's not like it's gonna kill me
to have a little taste, right?

50:25.859 --> 50:27.444
You drink up now,
there's plenty more

50:27.444 --> 50:29.612
where that came from.

50:29.612 --> 50:30.697
Okay.

50:57.098 --> 50:58.558
Well?

50:58.558 --> 51:02.437
It's really good.
It's really good.

51:02.437 --> 51:06.274
Finally someone around here
who doesn't get all paranoid

51:06.274 --> 51:07.859
about that salmonella.

51:10.195 --> 51:11.279
Oh God.

51:14.074 --> 51:15.450
I remember when Dave
first came to dinner.

51:15.450 --> 51:16.993
I thought I was gonna
have to take him to the ER.

51:18.536 --> 51:20.163
Same thing happened
with your father.

51:20.163 --> 51:21.498
I gave him fair warning,

51:21.498 --> 51:23.333
it's not my fault he was afraid
to offend Grandma.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.876
Aw, I thought it was sweet.

51:27.379 --> 51:29.089
This always makes Dave
feel better.

51:29.089 --> 51:30.131
Okay.

51:35.011 --> 51:36.346
Perfect.

51:36.346 --> 51:38.056
It's great. Thank you.

51:45.397 --> 51:47.148
Well... how do I look?

51:47.148 --> 51:48.858
I'm sorry, you don't have to
wear that if you don't want to.

51:48.858 --> 51:50.527
Why?

51:50.527 --> 51:52.028
You don't think I can pull off
the whole Derrieux family look?

51:52.028 --> 51:53.363
Oh, is that how we look?

51:55.115 --> 51:57.367
You know, I don't think I have
ever been given anything

51:57.367 --> 51:59.786
that somebody's actually
made before.

52:01.538 --> 52:02.914
It's kinda nice.

52:05.750 --> 52:08.586
Well here, I brought you
some pie.

52:08.586 --> 52:10.547
It'll help wash that really
good eggnog outta your mouth.

52:10.547 --> 52:14.092
I've got the decorations
for your tree out front.

52:14.092 --> 52:16.136
Uh, my back's a little sore.

52:16.136 --> 52:17.387
Since we got him here,

52:17.387 --> 52:18.680
maybe Scott wouldn't mind
lending a hand?

52:18.680 --> 52:19.389
Oh, yeah.

52:19.389 --> 52:20.265
You up for it, Briggs?

52:20.265 --> 52:21.266
Happy, happy... happy to help.

52:21.266 --> 52:22.517
What do I say?

52:22.517 --> 52:24.227
You can always count on
a Fighting Trout.

52:24.227 --> 52:25.770
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

52:26.396 --> 52:27.897
I... I know I'm kinda new
to this whole thing

52:27.897 --> 52:31.401
but isn't a Christmas tree,
like, inside the house?

52:31.401 --> 52:32.777
No, I've never heard of that.

52:37.198 --> 52:39.284
So... explain this to me again.

52:39.284 --> 52:40.702
So when I was little,

52:40.702 --> 52:44.581
I loved decorating the Christmas
tree so much

52:44.581 --> 52:46.708
that when we had
to throw it away,

52:46.708 --> 52:49.669
I would have a full-on meltdown.

52:49.669 --> 52:52.172
Just... temper tantrum
for days.

52:52.172 --> 52:53.757
You? No. I don't believe it.

52:55.258 --> 52:57.719
Anyway... one day my dad
comes home

52:57.719 --> 53:00.305
with a little, itty-bitty tree.

53:00.305 --> 53:03.058
And he tells me that
if I help him plant it,

53:03.058 --> 53:06.561
we will have a Christmas tree
all year long.

53:06.561 --> 53:10.315
And that was... gosh,
that was 20 years ago.

53:10.315 --> 53:12.317
And we still decorate it
to this day.

53:12.317 --> 53:13.568
The only thing my dad
ever got me

53:13.568 --> 53:16.821
was a bunch of
used hockey pucks.

53:16.821 --> 53:19.199
I think what you have's
really sweet.

53:19.199 --> 53:21.659
It's, um... it's really special.

53:29.334 --> 53:31.127
I should get, um...

53:32.796 --> 53:34.547
- I should get going.
- Yeah.

53:34.547 --> 53:36.591
I gotta get up early tomorrow

53:36.591 --> 53:39.302
and help decorate for that whole
Christmas jamboree.

53:39.302 --> 53:40.637
Right. Right.

53:40.637 --> 53:42.555
And I promised Becca
that I would wake up early

53:42.555 --> 53:44.182
and help her show
another house.

53:44.182 --> 53:45.725
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:45.725 --> 53:46.976
You're gonna come...

53:46.976 --> 53:49.479
you and your family are
gonna come tomorrow.

53:49.479 --> 53:51.481
Yeah. Yeah, we'll be there.

53:51.481 --> 53:52.774
Okay. Good.

53:52.774 --> 53:55.110
Well... I'll see you tomorrow.

54:11.876 --> 54:13.253
Hey. What book
are you reading?

54:13.253 --> 54:14.462
<i>Diary of a Christmas Elf.</i>

54:14.462 --> 54:17.340
I thought so.
You know, I loved that book.

54:17.340 --> 54:18.842
She loves all books.

54:18.842 --> 54:20.760
Honestly, we can't keep up
with her reading habit.

54:20.760 --> 54:22.345
Oh yeah? Well, you'll be
able to here.

54:22.345 --> 54:24.514
There's a library
two minutes away.

54:24.514 --> 54:25.807
Is that so?

54:25.807 --> 54:27.058
Oh yeah.

54:27.058 --> 54:28.518
We used to spend hours
in there after school.

54:28.518 --> 54:29.686
Yeah.

54:29.686 --> 54:30.687
She would absolutely love it.

54:30.687 --> 54:32.856
Well, that's what's important.

54:32.856 --> 54:35.066
I really think that we can
be happy here.

54:40.488 --> 54:41.364
Thank you.

54:41.364 --> 54:42.365
Oh, you're welcome.

54:42.365 --> 54:43.992
You are so welcome, sweetie.

54:43.992 --> 54:45.326
See you guys.

54:45.326 --> 54:46.578
- Bye.
- Bye.

54:47.912 --> 54:51.374
Oh my gosh.
That was so sweet.

54:51.374 --> 54:52.292
Adorable.

54:52.292 --> 54:53.752
Yeah.

54:53.752 --> 54:55.879
You know Becca,
you're a natural at this.

54:57.172 --> 54:59.466
You know, I think this is
the first job

54:59.466 --> 55:02.260
I've ever had where
I actually feel...

55:02.260 --> 55:04.554
really good about what
I'm doing.

55:04.554 --> 55:05.430
I love that.

55:05.430 --> 55:06.514
Yeah.

55:06.514 --> 55:07.974
But I have to admit,

55:07.974 --> 55:10.894
it's really nice to see someone
who's actually happy

55:10.894 --> 55:12.937
about what they're buying
for a change.

55:12.937 --> 55:15.315
What? 'Cause your clients
aren't happy?

55:15.315 --> 55:17.609
Oh no, they're happy about
the deal that I get them.

55:17.609 --> 55:20.153
But it's not like
they're starting families

55:20.153 --> 55:22.655
or making memories.

55:24.074 --> 55:25.575
You know...

55:25.575 --> 55:28.078
I was thinking about how you
were looking for new clients.

55:28.078 --> 55:29.496
Yeah.

55:29.496 --> 55:32.123
I just found out that
Wendy Vaughn, who sells, like,

55:32.123 --> 55:35.960
half the houses in this town,
is retiring.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.922
That means a lot more
potential clients.

55:38.922 --> 55:40.131
I see.

55:40.131 --> 55:42.926
I know it's crazy,
I just thought...

55:42.926 --> 55:46.429
maybe, if things weren't
working out in New York,

55:46.429 --> 55:48.139
you and I could start a team.

55:49.808 --> 55:51.393
Well I have to admit,

55:51.393 --> 55:53.228
you're a lot more fun to work
with than my current colleagues.

55:53.228 --> 55:54.145
Agreed.

55:55.855 --> 56:00.402
I don't know. That's just...
that's a really big change.

56:00.402 --> 56:02.570
You know, I'm not...

56:02.570 --> 56:05.448
I'm not sure that I'm quite
ready for that.

56:05.448 --> 56:08.785
No, no, of course.
It's just an idea.

56:08.785 --> 56:11.579
Think of it as a backup plan
in case you decide

56:11.579 --> 56:14.040
you wanna come back
to this crazy little town.

56:15.375 --> 56:17.335
- Thanks.
- Okay.

56:27.220 --> 56:30.432
Nice hustle out there boys,
even you Pierre.

56:30.432 --> 56:31.558
Good work.

56:31.558 --> 56:32.976
Briggs, hang back.

56:32.976 --> 56:34.936
I need to talk to you
for a minute.

56:37.856 --> 56:39.399
Now, I know it's a little early

56:39.399 --> 56:42.110
for Christmas presents but, um...

56:42.110 --> 56:43.695
there's something
I wanna give you.

56:46.072 --> 56:49.242
You got me a...
you got me a book?

56:49.242 --> 56:51.327
A book that smells surprisingly
like our locker room.

56:53.038 --> 56:55.790
It's not just any book, that's
the book that changed my life.

56:59.836 --> 57:02.130
I don't understand.

57:02.130 --> 57:04.841
I know you got your heart
set on making it to the bigs,

57:04.841 --> 57:07.010
but I heard you did
a pretty great job

57:07.010 --> 57:08.678
coaching those kids
the other day.

57:08.678 --> 57:13.558
Oh. That, uh... that was...
that was just for fun.

57:13.558 --> 57:16.811
No, I... I don't wanna
become a coach.

57:16.811 --> 57:19.731
A coach isn't something
you just become.

57:19.731 --> 57:22.776
The way you helped Zetner,
the way you helped Pierre.

57:22.776 --> 57:24.235
It's already who you are.

57:28.406 --> 57:32.077
Listen, I am...
I appreciate this.

57:32.077 --> 57:37.457
I do, but I... I have been
trying so hard to get called up.

57:37.457 --> 57:40.126
I... I can't throw that away.

57:41.670 --> 57:46.257
Okay. But let me
ask you something.

57:46.257 --> 57:48.968
When you put on that jersey
on Friday night,

57:48.968 --> 57:52.180
are you still having any fun
or maybe you're just doing it

57:52.180 --> 57:54.432
to prove something
to somebody else?

57:55.475 --> 57:56.601
Coach, I...

57:56.601 --> 57:58.353
Look, finish out the season.

57:58.353 --> 58:01.231
Hopefully you get picked up by
some team from who knows where.

58:01.231 --> 58:02.941
But if you're
still interested...

58:04.609 --> 58:06.277
we'll have a home for you
right here.

58:09.906 --> 58:11.408
I'll think about it.

58:42.397 --> 58:43.440
Ooh!

58:43.440 --> 58:44.232
Hey Scott.

58:44.232 --> 58:45.650
Come on, Scott.

58:45.650 --> 58:47.444
You gotta keep your head up,
you should know that.

58:47.444 --> 58:48.695
Solid advice.

58:48.695 --> 58:50.405
Well, the team sure did
a bang-up job this year.

58:50.405 --> 58:52.115
Yeah, everything
looks amazing.

58:52.115 --> 58:54.117
You know, you've really
outdone yourselves.

58:54.117 --> 58:56.119
Well, it's worth it to show
a little gratitude

58:56.119 --> 58:58.288
to such great fans
like you guys.

59:00.749 --> 59:02.792
Scott, come be on my team.

59:02.792 --> 59:04.419
Um... I should...

59:04.419 --> 59:05.587
I should probably get you guys
some drinks or something first.

59:05.587 --> 59:07.088
Oh, come on!
You've worked hard enough.

59:07.088 --> 59:10.425
It is time for you to have a
real Idaho Falls experience.

59:16.222 --> 59:18.641
Um... you know, I think this is
where I draw the line.

59:18.641 --> 59:20.685
Alright, well we could have
Dave take you real fishing

59:20.685 --> 59:22.312
with his buddies.

59:22.312 --> 59:23.772
Trust me, this is getting
off easy.

59:24.731 --> 59:26.024
I'll take your word for it.

59:26.024 --> 59:27.400
You're going down, buddy.

59:29.402 --> 59:30.528
Okay.

59:30.528 --> 59:32.989
Alright folks, welcome
to Merry Fishmas.

59:32.989 --> 59:34.741
Now the rules of the game
are simple.

59:34.741 --> 59:37.827
First team to have every member
pull up a trout

59:37.827 --> 59:41.331
within the 60-second time limit
will be crowned victorious.

59:42.957 --> 59:43.958
Team one, are you ready?

59:43.958 --> 59:45.251
- Yes!
- Yeah!

59:45.251 --> 59:46.670
Team two, are you ready?

59:46.670 --> 59:48.088
Yeah!

59:48.088 --> 59:49.506
Let's get fishing.

59:49.506 --> 59:50.340
Whoo!

59:54.344 --> 59:55.387
You got this, Parker!

59:55.387 --> 59:57.055
Oh, you got this, Parker!

59:57.055 --> 59:58.598
That was almost in.

59:58.598 --> 01:00:00.058
Oh, oh, oh!

01:00:00.058 --> 01:00:01.810
Slow and steady
wins the race.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.603
I almost got it.
Oh man.

01:00:03.603 --> 01:00:05.480
Got it!

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.482
Yes, Parker.
Coming in quick!

01:00:12.278 --> 01:00:14.030
Oh, I got one! I got one!

01:00:19.744 --> 01:00:22.288
Oh, my god!

01:00:22.288 --> 01:00:24.207
Not much time left.

01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:25.834
Come on, it's all up to
you, Dave.

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:30.213
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:00:30.213 --> 01:00:32.298
- Go, come on!
- I need one more.

01:00:32.298 --> 01:00:33.591
Time's ticking down.

01:00:33.591 --> 01:00:35.051
Come on, Dave.
You got this.

01:00:39.973 --> 01:00:41.266
Stop!

01:00:42.642 --> 01:00:44.978
It's all you, Dave.
Remember what I taught you.

01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:46.146
You can do it.

01:00:46.146 --> 01:00:48.064
Slow and steady
wins the race.

01:00:57.073 --> 01:00:58.658
Oh!

01:00:58.658 --> 01:01:00.618
- Very nice!
- Whoo!

01:01:02.328 --> 01:01:04.456
Well, team Briggs comes through
in the clutch

01:01:04.456 --> 01:01:06.750
and takes home
the championship.

01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:16.426
Admit it, you had fun.

01:01:16.426 --> 01:01:18.428
Ah... I wouldn't go that far.

01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:20.847
Although it was kinda nice
to take down Dave.

01:01:20.847 --> 01:01:24.225
Mm-hmm. I think we make
a pretty decent team.

01:01:24.225 --> 01:01:25.352
Yeah.

01:01:26.603 --> 01:01:28.813
Hey, can I ask you
a serious question?

01:01:28.813 --> 01:01:30.565
Sure.

01:01:30.565 --> 01:01:33.109
You grew up here so you've seen
a bunch of players come and go.

01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:34.319
Mm-hmm.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.240
Do you think I have what
it takes to get to Boise?

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.658
Are you serious?

01:01:41.284 --> 01:01:42.577
Yeah.

01:01:43.995 --> 01:01:46.539
Yeah, it's just...

01:01:46.539 --> 01:01:50.335
I have pursued this
my whole life

01:01:50.335 --> 01:01:54.923
and sometimes I wonder
if I'm being delusional.

01:01:54.923 --> 01:01:58.259
You know, like if I should start
considering other options.

01:01:58.259 --> 01:01:59.511
What other options?

01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:03.848
Coaching.

01:02:04.724 --> 01:02:07.644
Coach Jensen said
that there might be...

01:02:07.644 --> 01:02:09.270
there might be an assistant
coaching position

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:11.940
for me next year.

01:02:13.024 --> 01:02:14.526
You wanna coach the Trouts?

01:02:16.695 --> 01:02:17.612
I don't know.

01:02:18.988 --> 01:02:19.698
Maybe.

01:02:21.282 --> 01:02:23.493
It'd be nice to settle
down somewhere.

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:28.998
Sorry.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:34.629
Oh... I should really see
who this is.

01:02:35.797 --> 01:02:37.257
I'm sorry.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:38.842
Can... can I just meet you
over by the gingerbread table?

01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:41.636
Yeah. Yeah, I'll just be over
at the gingerbread table.

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.142
This is Ashley Derrieux.

01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:48.351
Hi Ashley.

01:02:48.351 --> 01:02:50.103
This is Bonnie Sullivan
from Main Financial.

01:02:50.103 --> 01:02:51.521
You left us a message
the other day?

01:02:51.521 --> 01:02:54.774
Bonnie, yes.
The West Village Hotel.

01:02:54.774 --> 01:02:56.234
That's us.

01:02:56.234 --> 01:02:58.194
That property is so beautiful.

01:02:58.194 --> 01:02:59.362
Yeah, we think so too.

01:02:59.362 --> 01:03:00.947
And going over
your recent sales,

01:03:00.947 --> 01:03:03.074
I think you might be the right
agent for the job.

01:03:03.074 --> 01:03:04.784
Well, I'd hate to disagree
with you on that.

01:03:06.036 --> 01:03:07.328
Listen, there's one catch.

01:03:07.328 --> 01:03:08.872
Okay.

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:10.373
I have these heavy hitters
in from out of the country

01:03:10.373 --> 01:03:11.916
and they've been hounding me
to go see the place.

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.335
You already have
potential buyers.

01:03:13.335 --> 01:03:14.252
Mm-hmm.

01:03:14.252 --> 01:03:15.920
When do you need me by?

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.590
I know it's a lot to ask, but
can you be here by the 23rd?

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.551
So... I'm actually in Idaho
Falls right now.

01:03:21.551 --> 01:03:24.679
I... I really don't know
if I can even find a flight.

01:03:24.679 --> 01:03:26.598
I'll tell you what, if you can
make this deal happen for me,

01:03:26.598 --> 01:03:29.434
I have three more buildings
coming up in the new year.

01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:37.442
Okay. Let me look at some
flights, see what I can do,

01:03:37.442 --> 01:03:40.487
and I will get back to you
as soon as possible. Okay?

01:03:40.487 --> 01:03:41.613
Sounds good.

01:03:41.613 --> 01:03:42.614
Okay.

01:03:48.286 --> 01:03:49.412
How's everybody doing?

01:03:49.412 --> 01:03:51.247
- Hey Dad.
- Dad.

01:03:51.247 --> 01:03:52.749
Have, uh, you seen Parker?

01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:54.751
Yeah, he's over there playing
a game with Coach Gus.

01:03:54.751 --> 01:03:56.544
Alright. Come on,
come on, come on.

01:03:56.544 --> 01:03:59.422
- You got it, you can do it.
- You got it.

01:03:59.422 --> 01:04:01.216
Oh, you got it.
There you go.

01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:03.426
- That's it.
- Well, he's got it.

01:04:03.426 --> 01:04:04.594
There you go.

01:04:04.594 --> 01:04:06.096
There she goes,
there she goes.

01:04:08.014 --> 01:04:11.101
I swear, sometimes I feel like
I have two children.

01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:12.143
I agree.

01:04:21.486 --> 01:04:23.780
Hey.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.283
This is my first gingerbread
house ever,

01:04:27.283 --> 01:04:29.786
so... don't judge.

01:04:29.786 --> 01:04:30.829
Mm-hmm.

01:04:32.664 --> 01:04:33.957
Is everything okay?

01:04:33.957 --> 01:04:37.335
Yeah. That was just a very
unexpected phone call.

01:04:37.335 --> 01:04:39.170
Ex-boyfriend?

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:40.463
No.

01:04:40.463 --> 01:04:42.924
No, it's this mid-century hotel
in New York

01:04:42.924 --> 01:04:44.843
that I've had my eye on
for years

01:04:44.843 --> 01:04:47.846
and they called wanting me
to represent it.

01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:52.809
So... that doesn't sound
so bad.

01:04:52.809 --> 01:04:54.811
Well, they want me there
in two days.

01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:56.354
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:04:56.354 --> 01:04:58.773
I mean, it's a great
opportunity. I...

01:04:58.773 --> 01:05:03.653
I... just don't know that I
wanna rush back there right now.

01:05:09.743 --> 01:05:13.830
Well, do you have to decide
this second?

01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:14.748
No.

01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:18.043
Good.

01:05:21.046 --> 01:05:23.340
Because this house is about
to fall over

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.759
unless it gets some
serious assistance.

01:05:25.759 --> 01:05:28.053
Okay, I think I can handle that.

01:05:28.053 --> 01:05:29.220
Please, help me.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.638
Oh brother.
What'd you do?

01:05:30.638 --> 01:05:31.765
I don't know.

01:05:39.064 --> 01:05:40.273
- It was him!
- It was her!

01:05:40.273 --> 01:05:42.025
Oh yeah? Is that how you guys
wanna play it?

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:43.526
Oh boy.

01:05:43.526 --> 01:05:45.320
Well, that just means...
you both are going to get it.

01:05:48.698 --> 01:05:50.867
Got him!

01:05:50.867 --> 01:05:52.077
Get him, Parker!

01:05:57.415 --> 01:06:01.503
That's enough fun.
It's time for serious business.

01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:03.046
Oh yeah.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:04.631
Scott, are you gonna help?

01:06:04.631 --> 01:06:06.716
Uh... I'd love to
but I've, uh...

01:06:06.716 --> 01:06:07.676
I gotta get to practice.

01:06:07.676 --> 01:06:08.802
Wait, wait, wait.

01:06:08.802 --> 01:06:10.261
Have you ever built
a snowman before?

01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:12.347
Uh...

01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:13.807
Okay. Alright.

01:06:13.807 --> 01:06:15.975
This is way more important
than hockey.

01:06:19.104 --> 01:06:20.563
Okay.

01:06:20.563 --> 01:06:21.981
Hey Parker.

01:06:21.981 --> 01:06:24.275
Did you know that you might
be building a snowman

01:06:24.275 --> 01:06:27.654
with a future Fighting Trout
assistant coach?

01:06:27.654 --> 01:06:29.906
You're gonna be coaching
the Trout?

01:06:29.906 --> 01:06:31.282
That would be so cool.

01:06:31.282 --> 01:06:33.243
Well, nothing is official yet.
Alright?

01:06:33.243 --> 01:06:35.203
I have a whole other season
playing on the ice.

01:06:35.203 --> 01:06:37.956
It's just... something to think
about in the future, that's all.

01:06:37.956 --> 01:06:39.958
Well, take it from me...

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:41.084
you could do a lot worse

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:43.628
than making a home here
in Idaho Falls.

01:06:43.628 --> 01:06:46.131
It's always done right by us.

01:06:46.131 --> 01:06:49.718
And on that note,
Dad... carrot please.

01:06:49.718 --> 01:06:50.802
Thank you.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:56.016
I think you should do
the honors. Right?

01:06:57.559 --> 01:06:58.268
Alright.

01:06:59.352 --> 01:07:00.520
Let's see if I can figure
this out.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.938
It can't be that hard.

01:07:01.938 --> 01:07:04.357
Uh... what do you think?
Right, uh... right about here?

01:07:04.357 --> 01:07:05.525
Maybe on the face?

01:07:07.736 --> 01:07:10.321
Okay.
Like, uh... here?

01:07:10.321 --> 01:07:11.614
Hmm, a bit higher.

01:07:11.614 --> 01:07:12.824
A bit higher?
Right around here?

01:07:12.824 --> 01:07:13.908
A bit...

01:07:13.908 --> 01:07:15.201
Right around...
just say when.

01:07:15.201 --> 01:07:16.077
Perfect.

01:07:16.077 --> 01:07:17.120
- If you say so?
- There you go.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.079
Nice.

01:07:26.671 --> 01:07:28.840
Anyways, welcome.

01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:37.390
Who was that?

01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.059
That is the new right wing.

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:41.353
Wait, you play right wing.

01:07:43.646 --> 01:07:44.898
I remember.

01:07:44.898 --> 01:07:46.816
The new guy's here.

01:07:46.816 --> 01:07:49.944
There's 24 guys
on the roster max.

01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:53.948
Someone's getting cut.

01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:55.784
Maybe they're moving
one of us up.

01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:56.701
Hey Gus.

01:07:56.701 --> 01:07:57.660
Yeah?

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.579
Anybody in Boise get injured?

01:07:59.579 --> 01:08:00.997
Uh... no, no.

01:08:00.997 --> 01:08:03.166
Anyone there get moved up
to Seattle?

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.376
Hmm... no.

01:08:08.713 --> 01:08:10.590
Briggs. My office, 15 minutes.

01:08:16.845 --> 01:08:19.140
Scott...

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:20.140
So sorry.

01:08:21.725 --> 01:08:23.144
Yeah, sorry man.

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:26.231
It's... it's fine.

01:08:27.607 --> 01:08:29.859
I... you know, I...

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:31.403
I've been cut before, guys.

01:08:34.154 --> 01:08:36.533
Best thing to do is just
walk in there

01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:39.035
and face the music
like a man.

01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:49.045
Listen, um... before you
say anything.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.049
I've been thinking about
the coaching offer.

01:08:58.388 --> 01:09:02.225
I know you're gonna cut me.
So if the offer still stands...

01:09:02.225 --> 01:09:04.060
Who said anything
about cutting you?

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:05.979
Well, you didn't have
to say anything.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:07.856
My... my replacement's standing
outside the locker room.

01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:09.399
Oh, that's right.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.152
While he's replacing you,
you're replacing Zetner.

01:09:13.028 --> 01:09:14.319
Well, Zetner's in Boise.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:15.529
Was in Boise.

01:09:17.448 --> 01:09:20.618
Some guys move up too fast.
They can't handle the pressure.

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:22.828
Uh...

01:09:22.828 --> 01:09:24.288
Zetner wasn't ready.

01:09:24.288 --> 01:09:25.957
So he's gonna take some time off

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:29.419
but Boise's gonna hold
his spot when he returns.

01:09:29.419 --> 01:09:30.587
Until then...

01:09:30.587 --> 01:09:33.423
You... you're saying that...

01:09:33.423 --> 01:09:35.258
You're going to Boise.

01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:36.468
I'm...

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:40.638
I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm going to Boise.

01:09:40.638 --> 01:09:41.930
Yes, you are.

01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:44.725
I'm... I'm... I'm going
to Boise.

01:09:44.725 --> 01:09:47.562
Thank you, uh...
so much, sir!

01:09:47.562 --> 01:09:50.273
I'm going to Boise, so...

01:09:50.273 --> 01:09:52.399
Alright. Hey, guys! Guys!
I'm going to Boise!

01:09:57.947 --> 01:09:59.991
Wow, okay.

01:10:02.327 --> 01:10:03.828
So, have you decided
whether you're going back

01:10:03.828 --> 01:10:05.288
for that big hotel deal?

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:07.999
No, I have to call her today.

01:10:07.999 --> 01:10:11.419
Well, I know it's
a great opportunity.

01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:14.214
I just hate the idea of spending
Christmas without you.

01:10:16.174 --> 01:10:18.760
Do you ever regret
staying here?

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.429
We're different, Ash.
You were always the smart one.

01:10:21.429 --> 01:10:22.847
Oh, please!

01:10:22.847 --> 01:10:24.766
It's true, even when
we were little kids.

01:10:24.766 --> 01:10:26.976
Everyone used to say
you'd go off and do big things.

01:10:26.976 --> 01:10:28.645
Well, you were always
a lot braver.

01:10:28.645 --> 01:10:30.063
- Ah...
- You were!

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:32.190
I mean, you did whatever
you wanted to do,

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:33.858
and you never cared
what anyone else thought.

01:10:33.858 --> 01:10:37.487
Sure, I made my mind up about
how I wanted my life to be.

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:40.156
But that doesn't mean there
aren't days where I wonder

01:10:40.156 --> 01:10:43.326
if the grass isn't greener
on the other side.

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:44.452
You do?

01:10:44.452 --> 01:10:47.372
Of course.
You have so much freedom.

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:50.000
You get to travel,
you wear fancy dresses,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.961
go out for expensive dinners.

01:10:52.961 --> 01:10:54.713
But whenever I talk to you...

01:10:57.132 --> 01:10:58.842
I don't know, the stress.

01:10:58.842 --> 01:11:00.385
Constantly running
from meeting to meeting,

01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:03.722
these boyfriends who don't know
how to treat you right.

01:11:05.932 --> 01:11:07.183
I just don't want you
to miss out

01:11:07.183 --> 01:11:08.810
on the things you love the most.

01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:11.396
Like what?

01:11:11.813 --> 01:11:13.481
Like... this.

01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:15.859
Sipping hot chocolate
in a cozy home,

01:11:15.859 --> 01:11:17.110
surrounded by people
that you know

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:19.195
will always be there for you.

01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:21.781
We're home.

01:11:21.781 --> 01:11:23.616
Hey, you two.

01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:24.701
Everything okay, buddy?

01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:25.744
I'm fine.

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:30.206
Where'd he get
that jersey from?

01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:31.499
Scott gave it to him.

01:11:31.499 --> 01:11:32.584
He did? Why?

01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:33.877
I guess you didn't hear
the big news.

01:11:33.877 --> 01:11:35.045
He got called up!

01:11:35.045 --> 01:11:36.338
You're kidding.

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:38.590
Well, don't act so surprised.

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:41.634
The man's practically turned
the whole team around in a week.

01:11:41.634 --> 01:11:44.429
Sure gonna miss him around here,
but if you ask me,

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:46.222
it couldn't happen
to a better guy.

01:11:47.766 --> 01:11:50.435
Yeah. So when does he leave?

01:11:50.435 --> 01:11:52.562
I'm taking him to the airport
in a couple hours.

01:11:52.562 --> 01:11:54.814
So you'd better hop to it if you
wanna say your goodbyes.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.948
Among the 12 potential inductees

01:12:03.948 --> 01:12:07.827
into this year's NHL Hall of
Fame class is Wayne Briggs.

01:12:07.827 --> 01:12:09.329
The former defenseman
led his team

01:12:09.329 --> 01:12:11.790
to two Stanley Cup championships.

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:15.627
And in my opinion, is the most
deserving of the bunch.

01:12:22.842 --> 01:12:24.803
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:26.888 --> 01:12:28.098
Do, uh... do you wanna come in?

01:12:28.098 --> 01:12:29.349
Thank you.

01:12:31.184 --> 01:12:35.438
Hey. I... I, um...
I heard you got promoted.

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:36.564
Yeah, I did.

01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:38.108
I was actually just about
to call you.

01:12:38.108 --> 01:12:43.071
Wow. That's amazing.
I'm... I'm so happy for you.

01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:44.239
Well, Boise's not too far away.

01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:45.407
If you wanna come down
for the first game

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:46.783
I can probably get you tickets.

01:12:46.783 --> 01:12:49.160
Well I would, but...

01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.955
I'm flying back to New York
for that client.

01:12:52.872 --> 01:12:55.667
It's everything I've been
working towards, so...

01:12:56.418 --> 01:13:00.630
Um... congratulations.

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.882
Looks like we're both finally
having our big break.

01:13:02.882 --> 01:13:03.800
Yeah.

01:13:07.012 --> 01:13:08.471
Well, I got you something.

01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:10.432
It's a little early, I know,

01:13:10.432 --> 01:13:12.350
but I'm not sure when
I'll see you again.

01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:15.979
I know it's sentimental,
I just thought...

01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:17.230
It's perfect.

01:13:18.773 --> 01:13:20.275
This way you'll always
have a family on Christmas.

01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:26.489
It's perfect. Thank you.

01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:27.449
You're welcome.

01:13:31.619 --> 01:13:33.246
I, uh... I actually
got you something too.

01:13:33.246 --> 01:13:34.664
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

01:13:34.664 --> 01:13:35.874
Oh.

01:13:35.874 --> 01:13:37.542
I was gonna put it
under your tree, but...

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:39.669
seeing as how you're here,
why don't you open it?

01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:41.463
Hmm. Okay.

01:13:47.135 --> 01:13:50.805
It's a plastic fish?

01:13:50.805 --> 01:13:52.057
It's not just a plastic fish,

01:13:52.057 --> 01:13:55.185
that's the plastic fish
you helped me catch.

01:13:55.185 --> 01:13:57.562
I thought you could hang it
on your tree.

01:13:57.562 --> 01:13:59.356
Just something
to remember me by.

01:14:01.232 --> 01:14:02.359
I like it.

01:14:05.820 --> 01:14:07.947
Hey, I wanna say something
to you before you go.

01:14:07.947 --> 01:14:09.324
Okay.

01:14:11.493 --> 01:14:13.536
I know that you wanna make it
in the NHL

01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:18.083
and I know that you wanna prove
you're just as good as your dad.

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:19.876
But I want you to know
how special

01:14:19.876 --> 01:14:23.171
this week has been for me.

01:14:23.171 --> 01:14:24.881
How special you are.

01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:29.260
And no matter where you end up,
nothing can take that away.

01:14:31.596 --> 01:14:32.597
Okay?

01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:36.976
I, um... I appreciate that.

01:14:36.976 --> 01:14:38.395
Mmhmm.

01:14:38.395 --> 01:14:41.231
And... I appreciate
you letting me act

01:14:41.231 --> 01:14:44.234
like I was a part of the family.

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:45.944
Even if that eggnog almost
killed me.

01:14:45.944 --> 01:14:47.237
Oh... woof.

01:14:51.241 --> 01:14:54.244
Seriously though,
I had a great time.

01:14:54.244 --> 01:14:55.912
Yeah, me too.

01:14:55.912 --> 01:14:58.164
And you know, if I, uh...

01:14:58.164 --> 01:14:59.749
if I ever play
Madison Square Garden.

01:14:59.749 --> 01:15:01.376
Mmm.

01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:02.252
You bet there'll be a front row
seat with your name on it.

01:15:02.252 --> 01:15:03.253
Oh, there better be.

01:15:03.253 --> 01:15:04.546
Yeah, it's a deal.

01:15:12.846 --> 01:15:14.305
Well, I should go.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.769
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

01:16:35.595 --> 01:16:36.429
Hey Scott.

01:16:36.429 --> 01:16:38.139
Parker. Hey.

01:16:38.139 --> 01:16:39.766
Scott, guess what?

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:42.227
We played the Grizzlies today
and we won.

01:16:42.227 --> 01:16:45.814
I used the grip that you taught
me and I scored two goals.

01:16:45.814 --> 01:16:49.109
Wow! That's so great,
buddy. I'm so proud of you.

01:16:51.319 --> 01:16:54.614
Listen, is, uh... is your
Aunt Ashley still around?

01:16:54.614 --> 01:16:58.201
I think she's outside.
You want me to get her?

01:16:58.201 --> 01:17:01.705
No. That's... that's alright.

01:17:01.705 --> 01:17:06.584
I, um... I... I want you
to tell everyone

01:17:06.584 --> 01:17:09.671
I just called to say
Merry Christmas.

01:17:09.671 --> 01:17:12.090
And that you're all welcome
to come up and see a game,

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:13.091
whenever you want.

01:17:13.091 --> 01:17:14.467
Cool. Thanks.

01:17:14.467 --> 01:17:16.094
Alright. I'll talk
to you later?

01:17:16.094 --> 01:17:17.137
Later.

01:17:19.305 --> 01:17:20.306
Bye.

01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:30.900
Hey kiddo.

01:17:31.901 --> 01:17:33.028
Are you all packed up?

01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:34.362
Yup, I sure am.

01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:38.158
Scott was trying to give you
a call.

01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:40.368
Must be quite an adjustment
being up there all by himself.

01:17:42.328 --> 01:17:43.455
Yeah.

01:17:43.455 --> 01:17:45.165
Oh sweetie.

01:17:45.165 --> 01:17:47.375
I know you two had
something special.

01:17:52.422 --> 01:17:59.512
Yeah. But it's not just Scott.
I mean, yes he's great, but...

01:17:59.512 --> 01:18:01.473
it's all of you guys.

01:18:01.473 --> 01:18:03.224
I mean, I wanted this client
so bad,

01:18:03.224 --> 01:18:06.144
but now I'm not even gonna be
here on Christmas.

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:08.980
Well, maybe it's okay to take
a step back for a little while.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.815
I'm sure they can find
another agent.

01:18:10.815 --> 01:18:12.901
Well, it's not really
that simple.

01:18:12.901 --> 01:18:14.611
I mean, if I bail on this deal,

01:18:14.611 --> 01:18:17.072
word will get around real fast
and then...

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:21.534
And you guys sacrificed
so much

01:18:21.534 --> 01:18:23.328
just for me to get
outta here that...

01:18:24.954 --> 01:18:27.499
I mean, it wouldn't be
fair if...

01:18:27.499 --> 01:18:29.125
if I threw that all away.

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:32.921
Ashley, we are so proud of you
and what you've accomplished.

01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:34.798
You don't have to do
anything for us.

01:18:36.591 --> 01:18:38.051
And you wouldn't
be disappointed?

01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:40.970
The only thing we'd be
disappointed in...

01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:43.807
is if you weren't living the
life that truly makes you happy.

01:18:47.143 --> 01:18:48.853
What if I don't know
what that is?

01:18:48.853 --> 01:18:53.692
Well, sometimes we don't know
what makes us happy

01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:56.236
until it's standing
right in front of us.

01:18:57.445 --> 01:18:59.030
But no matter what,

01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:02.033
we're always here
to support you.

01:19:02.033 --> 01:19:03.076
Thank you.

01:19:05.161 --> 01:19:07.664
- I really love you, guys.
- Baby...

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:09.124
Love ya, hon.

01:19:18.174 --> 01:19:19.592
We're here
with the newest member

01:19:19.592 --> 01:19:23.596
of the NHL Hall of Fame.
Congratulations Wayne Briggs.

01:19:23.596 --> 01:19:25.056
Your family must be
proud of you.

01:19:25.056 --> 01:19:27.642
Well, you know,
in this business

01:19:27.642 --> 01:19:29.185
your teammates
are your family.

01:19:29.185 --> 01:19:31.563
So I'd like to give a big
shout out to my family,

01:19:31.563 --> 01:19:34.607
especially that great goalie
we had on the Stanley Cup team,

01:19:34.607 --> 01:19:36.401
Victor Zalapski.

01:19:36.401 --> 01:19:39.863
Not to mention my boys who could
take a hit, shake it off,

01:19:39.863 --> 01:19:42.073
and get back out on the ice.

01:19:42.073 --> 01:19:43.742
I couldn't have done it
without them.

01:19:43.742 --> 01:19:44.951
You're talking
about the team

01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:47.370
you helped lead to two
Stanley Cup champion...

01:20:47.263 --> 01:20:50.642
You know, I've read
that one too.

01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:54.396
It turns out being alone
at Christmas...

01:20:54.396 --> 01:20:56.481
isn't something I wanna
survive anymore.

01:20:58.024 --> 01:21:02.028
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in Boise.

01:21:02.028 --> 01:21:03.613
I was.

01:21:03.613 --> 01:21:05.532
You know, I couldn't stand the
thought of spending Christmas

01:21:05.532 --> 01:21:09.327
with 23 guys I barely know,

01:21:09.327 --> 01:21:11.371
when I already have the perfect
team right here.

01:21:13.707 --> 01:21:15.250
Yeah, but that was your dream.

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:21.673
You know, I think my dream was
to prove to myself that I'm...

01:21:21.673 --> 01:21:23.216
I'm just as good as my dad.

01:21:25.927 --> 01:21:30.432
Because of you,
and your crazy family,

01:21:30.432 --> 01:21:33.977
I realized that I don't have
to play hockey to do that.

01:21:36.187 --> 01:21:38.273
So what are you going to do?

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:48.783
I took the coaching job.
And I was thinking...

01:21:48.783 --> 01:21:54.205
if I stuck around Idaho Falls, maybe...

01:21:54.205 --> 01:21:57.584
maybe I could see you again
next Christmas.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:07.052
You took a...
a coaching job...

01:22:07.052 --> 01:22:09.179
just on the off-chance
that you might see me

01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:10.680
one week out of the year?

01:22:14.059 --> 01:22:17.270
Well... maybe that wasn't
the only reason.

01:22:17.979 --> 01:22:19.522
They have pretty great
medical insurance.

01:22:19.522 --> 01:22:20.899
Yeah.

01:22:20.899 --> 01:22:23.401
Full physio.

01:22:23.401 --> 01:22:24.402
A dental plan.

01:22:24.402 --> 01:22:25.320
Yeah.

01:22:39.292 --> 01:22:41.127
Those are really good benefits.

01:22:41.127 --> 01:22:42.003
Yeah.

01:22:44.255 --> 01:22:48.093
So... what
happens now?

01:22:49.552 --> 01:22:51.971
Okay. First thing in the
morning I am calling Becca.

01:22:51.971 --> 01:22:54.265
We have a real estate office
to set up.

01:22:54.265 --> 01:22:55.809
Sounds great.

01:22:55.809 --> 01:22:56.935
And actually, I have no clue
where I'm gonna stay tonight,

01:22:56.935 --> 01:22:58.144
so maybe you could find me
a place.

01:22:58.144 --> 01:23:00.021
Well, I may know of
a cute little cottage

01:23:00.021 --> 01:23:01.481
that just opened up.

01:23:01.481 --> 01:23:02.399
How are the neighbors?

01:23:02.399 --> 01:23:03.566
A little goofy.

01:23:03.566 --> 01:23:05.235
But their youngest daughter
is delightful.

01:23:05.235 --> 01:23:06.569
You should really get
to know her.

01:23:06.569 --> 01:23:07.529
I can't wait.

01:23:13.118 --> 01:23:15.036
845 Deerfield Court.
