Colt's really coming back!

00:24.357 --> 00:26.234
Get down here! Colt's coming back!

00:26.317 --> 00:29.029
Why is this such a big deal?
You watch that show every week.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.865
He's been in a Tijuana jail
for months, Kevin.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.242
Poor guy tried to open
a steakhouse down there,

00:34.325 --> 00:36.870
but instead of paying off the mayor,
he fucked his wife.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.997
It took a letter from Lee Trevino
to get him out.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.999
It's Luger time!

00:41.082 --> 00:42.667
Hey, Dad, Dad, Dad! Take my chair.

00:42.751 --> 00:45.754

-[chuckles] You're goddamn right!

00:56.264 --> 00:57.348
Who's Elvis?

00:57.432 --> 00:59.809

01:20.455 --> 01:21.539
He looks like hell.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.084
The man spent the last two months
shitting in a coffee can, Bill.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.210
Can you show some respect?

01:25.293 --> 01:28.671

All right, all right, not so loud.

We don't have to waste four hours

We just drink some booze, break a crib,

Frank, one hug cannot erase
40 years of hard feelings.

a lot of anger to work out.

-Next Sunday--
-Sunday! Sunday!

05:12.520 --> 05:14.230
Sorry, I can't turn it off.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.442
-Next day after Saturday...
-Thanks, man.

05:17.525 --> 05:20.737
...we will officially be The Kweeze.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.699
And change the annual KwockToberfest
to KweezeToberfest.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.660
KweezeToberfest?
Hey, man, why didn't I think of that?

05:27.744 --> 05:29.704
I love that! That's good shit!

05:30.705 --> 05:32.332
Thanks for your enthusiasm, Vic.

05:32.415 --> 05:36.919
KweezeToberfest will feature a lineup
of sizzling singer-songwriters

05:37.003 --> 05:39.672
that will get Robert Plant's cock
out of everyone's face

05:39.756 --> 05:42.008
so we can finally see a sunset.

05:42.091 --> 05:46.095
Oh, man, I got just what you need, man!

05:46.179 --> 05:49.265
Remember that band I liked
that you said was old and out of touch?

05:49.349 --> 05:53.061
Well, good news,
I want to play them again for you!

05:53.144 --> 05:56.898
Oh, Vic, Vic, Vic, Vic.
Don't you understand?

05:56.981 --> 06:00.234
You're a dinosaur, and the meteor hit.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.738
But a lot of people love dinosaurs,

06:03.821 --> 06:06.240
old people, in their 30s and 40s.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.076
Hey, I'm only 30, man.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.994
The odometer flipped, Vic.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.081
Okay, back to this century.

06:13.164 --> 06:16.667
I can walk backwards
and reverse the mileage.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.795
You're making me sad, man.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.173
[Frank]
Okay, what's wrong with it this time?

06:22.256 --> 06:24.926
Well, to put it in technical terms,

06:25.009 --> 06:27.553
you people don't know
what the fuck you're doing.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.723
-What are you talking about?
-[sighs] Where do I begin?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.810
There are claw marks
on the inside of the machine.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.187
It's full of melted duct tape.

06:36.771 --> 06:40.274
And someone turned the X-rays up
to a dangerous level

06:40.358 --> 06:44.695
to warm up a can of Dinty Moore stew
and overheated the core.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.323
Why the hell is the machine able
to go up that high in the first place?

06:47.407 --> 06:52.578
[sighs] Why is the speed limit 55,
but every car can do a hundred?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.248
Why are women's bikes
designed the way they are,

06:55.331 --> 06:57.458
yet we are the ones that have balls?

06:57.875 --> 07:02.422
You want to do this all day, or do you
want to solve the fucking problem?

07:02.505 --> 07:06.175
[sighs] Okay. Red, you're off X-ray duty.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.969
Go to the curb and do Rosie's job.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.638
Uh...
I don't know if I can do that, Frank.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.849
Ah, you'll be great.
Just turn on that Southern charm.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.852
I'm going to change my flight
to a different airline.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.146
Would you kindly hand me back my bag?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.523
Ma'am, on behalf of Mohican Airways,

07:20.606 --> 07:24.735
why don't you take off your girdle
and go fuck yourself?

07:24.819 --> 07:26.154
Oh.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.114
Jesus Christ, Red! What the fuck was that?

07:28.197 --> 07:30.408
I'm sorry, man.
I can't work with the public.

07:30.491 --> 07:34.120
My shrink at the VA says I get set off
by people telling me what to do.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.456
-Okay, okay.
-I'm like a wild horse

07:36.539 --> 07:38.082

07:38.166 --> 07:39.917
They're innocent creatures, Frank!

07:40.001 --> 07:42.670
They just want to graze and fuck, but no!

07:42.753 --> 07:46.966
We put blinders on them
so they can't see this beautiful world.

07:47.049 --> 07:48.926
And don't get me started on Mister Ed!

07:49.343 --> 07:51.053
[exhales] Just breathe, Frank.

07:51.137 --> 07:56.309
His mouth said lies,
but his eyes screamed the truth!

07:57.768 --> 08:00.354
[Menard] For the first time
in our school's history,

08:00.438 --> 08:03.191
the boys' hockey team has a winning record

08:03.274 --> 08:07.320
and will play for the Quint City
Championship next weekend.

08:07.403 --> 08:10.323
To celebrate them,
I request your enthusiasm

08:10.406 --> 08:13.784
for the next four to six minutes of pep.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.454

as well as the semi-regular replacement
of the urinal cakes,

08:46.400 --> 08:51.030
First, our goalie, a kid with a big heart
and a bigger head.

08:51.113 --> 08:56.953
Give it up for Little Ken Dryden,
Mr. Phillip Bonfiglio!

08:57.036 --> 08:59.288

08:59.872 --> 09:04.293
We fight and die for your glory!

09:04.377 --> 09:05.962
[cheering]

09:06.045 --> 09:09.590
Now that Amy's sick, I get to be the lead
in the play. Isn't that great?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.260
Yeah, it's bitchin'. Guess what else?

09:14.011 --> 09:17.265
My stupid goldfish choked to death
on some shotgun pellets.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.850
[gasps] Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.811
Yeah, but that's not the funniest part.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.231
I hammered the dead fish
till it was nothing but stink,

09:25.314 --> 09:29.569
then I carried it around in a sandwich bag
waiting to make my move.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.738
The next player is like a son to me

09:32.822 --> 09:36.659
because, according to the paternity test,
he is my son.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.703
Our center, Jimmy Fitzsimmons.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.580
[cheering]

09:41.914 --> 09:46.669
Thank you, Coach Dad.
Webster's defines "teamwork" as--

09:46.752 --> 09:48.546
-All right, shut up, bookworm.
-[grunts]

09:48.629 --> 09:49.463
[cheering]

09:49.547 --> 09:53.175
I brought the bag of dead fish smashings
to school,

09:53.259 --> 09:57.638
and when Amy wasn't looking,
I put it in her sloppy joe.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.473
Oh, my God.

09:59.974 --> 10:03.227
That's why she got sick? You poisoned her?

10:03.311 --> 10:05.062
Yep.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.859
Thank you so much!

10:09.942 --> 10:13.362
Last but not least, he wears number 16

10:13.446 --> 10:16.991
but averages 17 penalty minutes a game.

10:17.074 --> 10:20.995
My superstar, Bill Murphy!

[crowd] Rat! Rat! Rat! Rat! Rat! Rat!

10:25.791 --> 10:28.002
We're going to war with Stoughton
on Sunday.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.632
And we will slaughter them,
because I am The Rat!

10:32.715 --> 10:36.260
And this is Rat Poison!

10:36.344 --> 10:37.637
[Scott] Wouldn't that kill you?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.639
-Shut up, Scott!
-Ah!

10:40.097 --> 10:41.140
That's my Rat.

10:42.558 --> 10:44.977
Yeah! Yeah! [grunts]

10:45.061 --> 10:47.396
Bridget, I'll never be able to repay you.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.983
Yes, you will.
Give your brother this note for me.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.111
I usually don't chase old flames,

10:54.195 --> 10:58.574
but that little fire ant
has got the pipes flowing again.

11:02.411 --> 11:04.080
This has to stop.

11:04.163 --> 11:09.794
Every time that darned skeleton machine
breaks down, we lose precious income.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.922
And we are this close
to having our operator's license

11:13.005 --> 11:15.174
pulled by the Fa-hay-hay.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.301
It's terribly worrisome.

11:17.385 --> 11:21.931
Mrs. Dunbarton,
might I indulge in just one M?

11:22.014 --> 11:24.725
My doctor's keeping me on a strict diet,

11:24.809 --> 11:28.020
but with everything going on,
I think I've earned a sweetie.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.189
-Go ahead, Bob.
-Thank you.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.653
[moaning]

11:35.736 --> 11:37.488
Mrs. Dunbarton, uh...

11:38.072 --> 11:42.451
it may have been a mistake to try
and save money by not having the men

11:42.535 --> 11:44.912
do the recommended training
on the machine.

11:44.995 --> 11:48.207
And that's why I'm sending the two of you
to the factory in Cleveland

11:48.290 --> 11:52.128
where they make the X-rays,
to get trained on the thing,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.755
so you can then train the employees.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.675
Frank, we're going to Cleveland!

11:57.758 --> 12:01.929
I love a city that isn't afraid
to stand up to the surgeon general.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.182
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can't leave town.
My wife is close to her due date.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.602
I don't give a shit
if Christ is pushing the rock back

12:08.686 --> 12:11.147
and he's gonna guest host
for Johnny Carson!

12:11.230 --> 12:14.775
[gasps] You are going
to Cleveland with me tomorrow!

12:14.859 --> 12:16.986
Tomorrow? I can't, goddamn it! I just--

12:19.238 --> 12:20.906
[exhales]

12:20.990 --> 12:24.243
Mrs. Dunbarton, it might be better
if you sent one of the guys

12:24.326 --> 12:26.203
who actually operates the thing.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.456
You're right, Frank. You stay home.

12:28.539 --> 12:30.750
And I think it's wonderful that your wife

12:30.833 --> 12:34.378
has put on all that weight
and you still support her.

12:34.462 --> 12:37.673
I never experienced that
in a relationship.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.383
Fuck him.

12:39.467 --> 12:44.388
And, Bob, now that you're not fat,
you have no excuse to be a meanie-weenie.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.266
Of course. My apologies.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.770
Mrs. Dunbarton,
might I trouble you for another?

12:50.853 --> 12:51.979
Jesus Christ.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.064
Go ahead.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.066
Oh! Oh! Oh!

12:56.150 --> 12:59.069
The M stands for "my God"!

13:00.279 --> 13:02.865
<i>♪ Sailing on my catamaran ♪</i>

13:02.948 --> 13:06.952
<i>♪ Won't you call me Mr. Catamaran ♪</i>

13:07.912 --> 13:08.871
What do you think?

13:08.954 --> 13:12.750
It's good, but isn't that the song
you wrote about me?

13:12.833 --> 13:15.294
Yeah, but I'm trying
to get it on the radio,

13:15.377 --> 13:18.798
and more people know about catamarans
than know who you are.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.883
So I had to change the lyrics.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.927
It's a logistics thing.

13:23.010 --> 13:23.928
Okay.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.681
[sighs]
Kevin, I liked the old song better.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.893
It sounded more like you.
You don't care about boats.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.854
Okay, fine, I don't.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.483
But my manager, Vic, told me it's
really hip to sing about stuff like that.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.860
And I live under my parents' house,

13:39.944 --> 13:44.907
so I wrote some shit about some dildo
on a catamaran so I can have a hit,

13:44.990 --> 13:48.452
move out of the basement, and live
in a place that has a fucking window

13:48.536 --> 13:50.496
so I can tell what fucking time it is!

13:50.579 --> 13:53.123
-Why are you yelling at me?
-Because you're yelling at me!

13:53.207 --> 13:57.169
-I'm not yelling at you.
-Well, it sounded like you were.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.423
I don't know why
I just flipped out like that.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.760
Oh, man, I'm acting just like my dad.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.345
I'm sorry, Alice.

14:06.428 --> 14:09.723
It's okay. I accept and believe
your apology.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.059
You do? Whoa.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.603
In my house, after we yell at each other,

14:14.687 --> 14:17.189
people don't speak again
until the next major sporting event.

14:17.273 --> 14:19.525
Well, good news, we're not related.

14:19.608 --> 14:21.569
[chuckles] That'd be really messed up.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.071
It would mean
I touched my sister's tits last night.

14:24.154 --> 14:25.114
[chuckles] Ew!

14:25.197 --> 14:28.158
[chuckles] Yeah. Ew, I know.

14:30.119 --> 14:33.330
Welcome back, Frank.
Sue tells me you got a new crib.

14:33.414 --> 14:38.794
Congratulations.
You've done the bare minimum as a father.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.546
-And you've been a f--
-Frank.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.548
Let me finish. [inhales]

14:43.173 --> 14:44.592
Phenomenal help.

14:44.675 --> 14:49.138
Oh. And you are
so full of shimmering energy.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.306
[sighs]

14:51.891 --> 14:54.351
-Thank you, Frank.
-What? Like I said, everything's fine.

14:54.435 --> 14:55.394
Let's rub some belly!

14:56.395 --> 14:57.730
Hey, it's Jack Jibbons!

14:57.813 --> 15:00.149
That's Jim Jeffords, and it's not me!

15:04.278 --> 15:07.615
Hey, hey, Sandy! Sandy!
Can I talk to you about my band?

15:07.698 --> 15:08.657
[groans]

15:08.741 --> 15:11.869
I'm telling you and your drug-induced
dementia for the last time.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.997
I don't want to hear about your band
or that old fart music.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.916
Oh, I get it, man.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.335
But these kids, they don't rock anymore.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.754
They changed their name.
They changed their sound.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.548
They're mellow as fuck. Check this out.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.426
[Vic] <i>You are Vic. You are cool.</i>

15:28.052 --> 15:32.431
<i>You fucked a lifeguard at 14,</i>
<i>but that is not when your life peaked.</i>

15:32.514 --> 15:34.725
Oops! [chuckles] Wrong track.
Sorry about that.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.520
[Vic] <i>She bent over</i>
<i>in that tollbooth and--</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:40.064
[chuckles] Almost got it.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.231
I got to go, Vic.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.068
[stammering] I really need this, man.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.613
If you give my band a spot
at KweefToberfest,

15:47.696 --> 15:50.407
-I promise I won't disappoint you.
-[sighs]

15:50.491 --> 15:53.077
Fine, but it's on you.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.579
They fail, you sail.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.332
Away. Into the sunset.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.876
While a turtle watches.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.721
You look so handsome
with your hair like that, Kevin.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.182
Thanks. I also shaved my arms.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.227
-Over here, Dad! I saved you a seat.
-[Big Bill chuckles]

16:18.310 --> 16:20.646
[piano playing]

16:20.729 --> 16:25.067
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Southwick Elementary Fourth Grade

16:25.150 --> 16:29.905
presents <i>Alfred P. Southwick:</i>
<i>Spark of Inspiration!</i>

16:31.281 --> 16:32.616
[woman] What happened to Amy Jenkins?

16:33.701 --> 16:34.910
That's my princess.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.538
You've done a great job with her, son.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.580
Thanks, Dad.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.582
Jesus, get a room, you two.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.543
Shut the fuck up, asshole.

16:42.626 --> 16:45.004
Hi, I'm Kevin's dad. You must be Alice.

16:45.087 --> 16:49.717
Let me tell you the story
of how my husband, Alfred P. Southwick,

16:49.800 --> 16:52.136
invented the electric chair.

16:52.219 --> 16:57.016
It all started in a beautiful day
of a botched hanging.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.102
Oh, how I wish I was dead already!

17:00.185 --> 17:05.524
My Quincy's a performer,
just like his mama.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.530
My good and chaste wife,
there must be a better way

17:11.613 --> 17:14.033
to execute murderers and the poor.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.745
And I know you will find
that better way, Alfred.

17:18.495 --> 17:22.291
<i>♪ Better way</i>
<i>We need a better way ♪</i>

17:22.374 --> 17:27.171

17:39.600 --> 17:41.769
[woman] Oh, isn't that's special?

17:42.686 --> 17:45.814
There will now be a brief intermission.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.941
[indistinct chatter]

17:49.401 --> 17:52.654
The guy who killed
all the people up there? That's my son.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.784
These should get me through winter.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.579
English is my favorite subject.
I guess I've always been a bit of a nerd.

18:00.662 --> 18:04.291
Mom, she's so good at reading.
Go ahead, show her!

18:05.501 --> 18:07.419
-Oh, it's The Rat!
-What a badass!

18:07.503 --> 18:09.588
Phillip's head is so much bigger
in person!

18:10.130 --> 18:11.048
Dick flick!

18:11.131 --> 18:13.342
-Ow!
-Nice try, psycho.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.636
Nobody flicks The Rat's dick but me.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.931
He makes me feel worthless.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.893
I love that redheaded piece of shit.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.396
Little Bill made his first girl cry.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.940
[chuckles]

18:28.023 --> 18:30.109
You raised him right, son.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.777
I don't like that he's The Rat.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.196
But he is a popular rat.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.157
-Ah.
-Ah.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.535
Frank, don't you think you've had enough?

18:39.618 --> 18:41.203
You have to drive us all home.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.247
Ah, I drive better drunk.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.374
When I'm buzzing, Sue,
I always let people in.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.335
Yeah, when he's sober,
he's giving them the finger.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.212
[both laugh]

18:53.132 --> 18:56.718
Oh, Sue, don't be such a wet blanket!
Come on, we're having a good time!

18:56.802 --> 18:59.972
[chuckles] Yeah, enjoy the evening.
Your daughter's a star.

19:00.055 --> 19:03.642
All you have to do is stand back
and watch her blossom.

19:03.725 --> 19:04.810
[chuckles]

19:04.893 --> 19:08.647
Well, it looks like you've learned
a thing or two about that over the years.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.108
Oh, how so?

19:11.191 --> 19:14.069
Well, you know, you're...
you're so encouraging now.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.405
I've always been encouraging.

19:16.488 --> 19:20.200
Yeah, well, you know, when I was a kid,
you encouraged me to get off the stage.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.577
Frank, don't.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.913
No, no, no, no. I'm not mad.
I'm not mad. I'm just making a joke.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.542
Honestly, I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:30.043 --> 19:33.463
Come on, Dad. We're okay now.
[stammers] You can admit what you did.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.715
Did what?

19:34.798 --> 19:37.384
[breathes deeply]

19:38.594 --> 19:40.512
You're not gonna deny this, are you?

19:40.596 --> 19:43.182
Tell me you're not gonna still deny
what you did to me.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.601
-Frank.
-Nah, it's okay, Sue. Dad, just say it.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.645
It was 30 years ago. Just say it,
and we'll bury it forever.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.857
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:51.940 --> 19:55.903
I just came down here
to watch my beautiful granddaughter.

19:55.986 --> 19:59.865
Oh, okay, all right. I get it. I get it.
The sweet-old-man routine, right?

19:59.948 --> 20:05.204
It's not a routine. I was always sweet.
You were just too sensitive.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.252
Francine.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.795
You son of a bitch!

20:13.879 --> 20:14.963
[all gasp]

20:15.047 --> 20:17.132
Hey, maybe you'd like to heckle
your granddaughter

20:17.216 --> 20:19.676
for the second half of the play
for old times' sake, huh?

20:19.760 --> 20:22.596
For the last fucking time,
I didn't heckle you!

20:22.679 --> 20:24.306
-Yes, you did!
-Bullshit!

20:24.389 --> 20:26.350
You forgot your goddamn fucking lines,

20:26.433 --> 20:28.810
and I was covering for you
with a couple of jokes!

20:28.894 --> 20:31.271
Well, I forgot my lines
because my own father

20:31.355 --> 20:34.650
was laughing at me
in front of the entire fucking town!

20:34.733 --> 20:37.736
You looked like Red Skelton's dick!

20:37.819 --> 20:40.447
Ah, there it is! There it is!

20:40.530 --> 20:42.491
Just once! Just fucking once,

20:42.574 --> 20:45.327
can you admit
what a selfish fucking asshole you were?

20:45.410 --> 20:49.414
Oh, you were always just like your mommy!

20:49.498 --> 20:55.003
A whiny bitch who turned on the waterworks
every time things got tough!

20:55.087 --> 20:58.882
-I'll show you tough, you piece of shit!
-Mr. Murphys, take your seats.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.425
The play is about to begin.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.636
-[both] Stay out of this, lady!
-Aw.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.891
Great news, Alfred. The governor called.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.893
The execution can proceed.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.521
-[Frank] Ah, you're full of shit!
-Huh?

21:12.604 --> 21:14.731
Oh, you think you're a big man now?
Here, what?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.441
Take a swing at me. Go on, hot shot!

21:16.525 --> 21:19.820
I've wanted to take a swing at you
for about 35 fucking years!

21:19.903 --> 21:22.364
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Go ahead! Right here!

21:22.447 --> 21:25.909
I'll give you the first shot,
you little fucking sissy!

21:25.993 --> 21:27.577
-Jesus!
-[crowd gasps]

21:27.661 --> 21:28.870
-Frank!
-[Kevin] Shit!

21:30.122 --> 21:32.624
Come on, let's finish this thing,
you fucking bastard! Get up!

21:32.708 --> 21:34.584
Hey, buddy, he's an 80-year-old man.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.963
No, he isn't! He's only 73!
So fucking butt out!

21:54.104 --> 21:55.105
[groans]

21:55.188 --> 21:56.606
What? He told me to hit him.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.826
Maureen, honey, I'm so sorry. I just--

22:07.909 --> 22:12.039
-Just please, let me make it up to you.
-I can never go to school again.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.334
All my friends were there.
They all saw it.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.626
[Sue] Maureen!

22:17.169 --> 22:18.420
It's okay, honey.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.048
You were so great tonight.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.758
[Maureen crying]

22:23.425 --> 22:28.180
-Do you want me to drive?
-I want you to walk into traffic.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.646
And the award for Dildo of the Century
goes to...

22:45.989 --> 22:47.240
Oh, boy.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.079
-[barking]
-Jesus!

22:52.996 --> 22:55.916
Okay. Not everybody in this house
hates me.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.668
Time to turn on the old Murphy charm.

22:59.252 --> 23:01.046
-Wish me luck, buddy.
-[whimpers]

23:03.382 --> 23:04.383
Hey, honey.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.426
Nice night for a walk. [chuckles]

23:07.594 --> 23:08.804
Okay. You're right.

23:09.679 --> 23:12.307
My father and I probably have
some unfinished business

23:12.391 --> 23:14.393
when it comes to talking about our past.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.521
And admittedly,
we got a little out of control

23:17.604 --> 23:19.189
at the function this evening, and I--

23:19.272 --> 23:22.734
I told you one hug
doesn't make everything better.

23:22.818 --> 23:26.321
You ignored me.
And tonight you embarrassed me.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.407
You embarrassed your sons.

23:28.490 --> 23:31.243
And you absolutely devastated
your daughter.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.036
In my defense,
I think I behaved pretty good

23:33.120 --> 23:35.372
-for the first half of the play.
-Shut up!

23:35.455 --> 23:37.749
Do you realize what you did
to that little girl tonight?

23:37.833 --> 23:39.501
Hey, why are you just coming at me?

23:39.584 --> 23:41.711
What about my dad?
He was right there with me!

23:41.795 --> 23:44.923
-How come you didn't give him any shit?
-Because I'm not married to him!

23:45.006 --> 23:47.759
For God's sake,
stop it with the self-pity!

23:47.843 --> 23:50.929
Well, no one else is gonna pity me!
Like every fucking thing else around here,

23:51.012 --> 23:53.348
if I want to get something done,
I got to do it myself!

23:53.432 --> 23:54.641
I mean, you never support me!

23:54.724 --> 23:57.853
You're always taking
other people's fucking sides!

23:57.936 --> 24:00.105
How about an "attaboy"
every once in a fucking blue moon?

24:00.188 --> 24:01.148
Would that kill you?

24:02.065 --> 24:02.983
Huh?

24:03.066 --> 24:06.319
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you got nothing
to say about that, do you? Huh?

24:06.987 --> 24:09.030
Of course not! No!

24:09.114 --> 24:12.117
Sitting there
with your arms crossed, right?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.577
Staring at the wall.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.788
Trying to make me feel uncomfortable.

24:17.330 --> 24:19.499
Well, it's not gonna work, lady. Okay?

24:21.710 --> 24:22.752
You hear me?

24:24.838 --> 24:27.549
You are not sleeping in this bed tonight.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.967
[scoffs]

24:29.634 --> 24:30.635
[scoffs]

24:31.845 --> 24:33.513
[panting]

24:34.806 --> 24:36.725
-Get off me.
-[whimpers]

24:39.895 --> 24:40.896
Princess?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.150
Oh.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.744
You were the lucky one, Chet.

25:12.719 --> 25:13.845
Eh.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.016
[grunting]

25:20.685 --> 25:22.812
[Dolores]
Aren't you coming to bed, Robert?

25:22.896 --> 25:25.899
I am watching an important program!

25:25.982 --> 25:28.944
[announcer] <i>Here's Hobo Jojo!</i>

25:30.153 --> 25:31.780
<i>What's happening, kids?</i>

25:31.863 --> 25:32.948
[grunts]

25:33.031 --> 25:34.199
What the fuck?

25:34.282 --> 25:36.701
A couple assassinations,

25:36.785 --> 25:40.205
-and they get whatever they want.
-[phone rings]

25:40.288 --> 25:41.206
What?

25:41.289 --> 25:42.749
[Frank] <i>Bob, it's me, Frank.</i>

25:42.832 --> 25:44.417
Are you seeing this, too?

25:44.501 --> 25:45.502
Bob, listen.

25:46.461 --> 25:47.712
I changed my mind.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.923
I need you to put me on that plane
to Cleveland tomorrow.

25:50.006 --> 25:53.468
Do you mean it?
You better not be joshing me.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.012
Oh, we're gonna have fun, Frank.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.807
Just put me on the plane.
I know where I'm wanted.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.892
I deserve a happy scoop!

26:00.976 --> 26:02.227
[grunts]

26:02.310 --> 26:05.146
I better warn you, I'm a snorer.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.316
Oh, who am I kidding?
We're not gonna get any sleep.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.151
We're going to Cleveland.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.321
<i>Birthplace of one of the guys</i>
<i>who thought of Superman.</i>

26:13.405 --> 26:15.824
<i>We'll be the most handsome fellas there.</i>

26:15.907 --> 26:19.369
<i>We can sneak down to Dayton</i>
<i>and catch a Phil Donahue taping.</i>

26:19.452 --> 26:23.415
<i>We can go to The Arcade,</i>
<i>which isn't an arcade,</i>

26:23.498 --> 26:29.170
<i>but an indoor shopping center,</i>
<i>with an entire court just for food.</i>

26:29.254 --> 26:32.507
<i>Lou "The Toe" Groza</i>
<i>has three car dealerships</i>

26:32.591 --> 26:34.342
<i>and an ice cream shop.</i>

26:34.426 --> 26:39.097
<i>We can go to Frankie Yankovic's polka bar</i>
<i>and point at the tuba player.</i>

26:39.180 --> 26:40.098
[gasps]

26:40.181 --> 26:43.810
<i>We can go visit the house</i>
<i>that Jim Brown used to live in</i>

26:43.893 --> 26:47.355
<i>before he moved to Hollywood. </i>[gasps]

26:47.439 --> 26:49.399
<i>We can take a whiz in Lake Erie.</i>

26:49.482 --> 26:50.358
[whirring]

26:50.442 --> 26:51.943
[gunshot]
