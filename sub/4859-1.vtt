01:21.566 --> 01:23.234
It's time.

01:25.236 --> 01:26.779
Hey there...

01:26.988 --> 01:30.700
...good morning. How are you today?

01:30.908 --> 01:33.244
Hey. What are you doing up?

01:33.453 --> 01:34.454
Moo.

01:36.205 --> 01:37.707
Is that Daddy?

01:41.586 --> 01:43.880
Hey there, cowgirl.

01:44.881 --> 01:47.467
She's a little feisty today.

01:48.468 --> 01:50.595
Babies should be sleeping.

01:51.554 --> 01:54.432
"I'm too hungry for my own good."
Yes.

01:58.269 --> 01:59.771
I gotta get ready.

02:05.902 --> 02:08.488
Wrong day to be forgetting stuff.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.949
You know how lucky you are.
Don't screw this up.

02:12.158 --> 02:14.118
All right! Jesus.

02:15.078 --> 02:18.289
- She go back to sleep?
- Yes. Ate like a pig.

02:18.498 --> 02:23.836
I know I'm lucky. I ace this job,
the department's wide open.

02:24.128 --> 02:28.633
Get my own division someday.
You should see their houses.

02:35.473 --> 02:36.849
Hello?

02:40.603 --> 02:41.604
Well, yes.

02:42.605 --> 02:44.023
Don't worry, I will.

02:44.649 --> 02:47.151
He's right here.
<i>It's Alonzo.</i>

02:54.075 --> 02:55.118
- Hello.
<i>- Hoyt?</i>

02:55.326 --> 02:56.369
Yes, sir.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.288
<i>- Going to roll call?</i>
- I'm leaving now.

02:59.497 --> 03:00.581
<i>- Hoyt?</i>
- Yes, sir?

03:00.790 --> 03:04.377
<i>- Fairies go to roll call. We don 't.</i>
- Good to know.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.755
<i>There's a coffee shop on 7th.</i>
<i>Be there at 10.</i>

03:07.964 --> 03:11.509
<i>Be in comfortable shoes.</i>
<i>Got a backup gun?</i>

03:11.718 --> 03:15.513
- Only the standard issue Beretta.
<i>- Bring it. Cuffs too.</i>

03:15.722 --> 03:19.183
<i>Maybe we'll do some business.</i>
<i>We're aggressive.</i>

03:19.392 --> 03:24.063
I know. That's why I signed up.
I want to thank you for this...

03:33.531 --> 03:34.907
What's wrong?

03:37.660 --> 03:39.579
Feels like football tryouts.

03:39.787 --> 03:43.750
I wish it was tomorrow
so I'd know if I made the squad.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.711
Listen, it's not tomorrow, it's today.

03:47.378 --> 03:50.715
- I know it's gonna work out.
- You do?

04:14.030 --> 04:15.531
Good morning, sir.

04:19.702 --> 04:21.245
No, thank you, ma'am.

04:21.454 --> 04:23.915
Get some chow in you.
My dollar.

04:24.457 --> 04:26.417
Thank you, sir, but I ate.

04:26.626 --> 04:27.919
Fine. Don't.

04:34.592 --> 04:36.219
It's nice here.

04:37.595 --> 04:38.638
May I read?

04:39.389 --> 04:41.557
- I'm sorry, sir. I...
- Thank you.

04:42.183 --> 04:46.187
- I'll get something to eat.
- Hell, no you won't. You fucked up.

04:46.437 --> 04:49.023
I'm trying to read. Please shut up.

05:08.501 --> 05:12.255
I'll like not being in a hot
black and white all summer.

05:17.260 --> 05:19.470
Tell me a story, Hoyt.

05:20.972 --> 05:24.434
- Like my story?
- Not your story, a story.

05:25.101 --> 05:29.230
Since you can't shut up
so I can read, tell me a story.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.607
- I don't know any.
- You don't?

05:31.816 --> 05:33.359
- No.
- I'll tell you one.

05:33.651 --> 05:37.864
This is a newspaper, right?
It's 90 percent bullshit.

05:38.072 --> 05:40.616
But it's entertaining. So I read it.

05:40.825 --> 05:45.538
It entertains me. You won't let me
read it, so you entertain me.

05:45.788 --> 05:47.832
Tell me a story now. Go.

05:48.416 --> 05:51.336
- There was a DUI stop.
- A DUI stop?

05:51.544 --> 05:53.212
Let me load up!

05:53.421 --> 05:56.424
- A DUI? Oh, shit!
- Well, I...

05:56.632 --> 05:59.635
- Listen, we were on midwatch...
- We who?

05:59.844 --> 06:02.805
- Oh, me and Debbie.
- Who's Debbie?

06:03.765 --> 06:06.184
Debbie Maxwell, my training officer.

06:06.851 --> 06:09.604
- A female training officer?
- Yes, sir.

06:09.854 --> 06:13.024
Okay. All right.

06:13.232 --> 06:14.901
Was she black, white?

06:15.109 --> 06:16.486
She was white.

06:17.654 --> 06:19.906
- Lick-her license?
- A what?

06:20.239 --> 06:23.493
A lick-her license.
Was she a dyke, a lesbian?

06:24.202 --> 06:26.996
- Is she any good?
- She's pretty good.

06:27.205 --> 06:29.624
- Okay, Debbie, midwatch. Go.
- Right.

06:29.832 --> 06:31.918
- It was a quiet night...
- Boom!

06:32.126 --> 06:36.047
- What the fuck?
- You never know, that's the point. Go.

06:36.255 --> 06:38.758
It was quiet and we're rolling...

06:39.008 --> 06:42.512
...I'm driving. This Acura,
just a beautiful car...

06:42.720 --> 06:47.433
...comes out a side street, all over
the median. I hit the wailer.

06:47.642 --> 06:50.895
He drives for 10 blocks
before he pulls over.

06:51.104 --> 06:54.023
Plates run clean,
so I test and arrest.

06:54.232 --> 06:57.527
I'm belting in our unit,
and she's tossing his car.

06:57.777 --> 07:02.490
She shows me a.38
and two loaded shotguns.

07:02.699 --> 07:05.243
- No shit?
- No shit! So...

07:05.451 --> 07:09.288
...she calls and I'm searching.
I find 500 grams of meth.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.417
Turns out he's on bail
for distribution...

07:12.834 --> 07:16.254
...on his way to smoke
his ex-partner before trial.

07:16.462 --> 07:17.505
Boom.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.259
- Prevented a murder.
- You got him. It's amazing.

07:22.010 --> 07:24.387
It is. That you're out there...

07:24.595 --> 07:29.767
...with a fine bitch for a year and
the best story you can tell me...

07:30.018 --> 07:31.728
...is a drunk stop.

07:34.772 --> 07:39.485
But I don't believe you.
You tapped that ass, didn't you?

07:41.321 --> 07:44.324
Tell the truth.
You know you tapped that ass.

07:44.574 --> 07:46.451
In the back, bam! Code X.

07:46.951 --> 07:49.412
- I got a wife.
- You got a dick.

07:51.289 --> 07:53.291
- You do have one, don't you?
- Yes.

07:53.499 --> 07:57.962
Your dick lines up straight.
Right and left of it are pockets.

07:58.171 --> 08:02.383
In those pockets are money.
Look in either one. Pay the bill.

08:11.684 --> 08:14.562
Grab that menu off that window for me.

08:21.653 --> 08:23.363
Get in, it's unlocked.

08:28.868 --> 08:31.204
Throw that in the glove box.

08:31.412 --> 08:35.332
- This is not from the motor pool.
- No. Sexy, though, huh?

08:36.000 --> 08:40.672
- Where's the office, at division?
- You're in the office.

08:43.424 --> 08:44.550
Going up.

09:09.575 --> 09:11.411
Today is a training day.

09:12.328 --> 09:14.747
Give you a taste of the business.

09:15.164 --> 09:17.542
I got 38 cases pending trial...

09:17.750 --> 09:21.004
...63 active investigations,
250 I can't clear.

09:21.379 --> 09:24.382
I supervise five officers.
Five personalities.

09:24.590 --> 09:27.343
Five sets of problems.
You could be six.

09:27.552 --> 09:29.929
I ain't holding no hands.

09:30.138 --> 09:33.141
You got today to show me
what you're made of.

09:33.599 --> 09:37.395
You don't like Narcotics,
get the fuck out of my car...

09:37.603 --> 09:40.732
...get a job chasing bad checks.
You hear me?

09:40.940 --> 09:42.483
- I hear you.
- Okay.

09:45.361 --> 09:47.113
Why do you want to be a narc?

09:47.405 --> 09:51.909
To serve my community by ridding
it of dangerous drugs.

09:52.118 --> 09:53.953
Right, but why a narc?

09:56.331 --> 09:58.082
I want to make detective.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.168
Stick with me, you can do it.

10:00.543 --> 10:02.795
Unlearn that academy shit.

10:03.004 --> 10:05.882
Don't bring that here.
It'll get you killed.

10:06.090 --> 10:08.468
I'll do anything you want me to do.

10:11.512 --> 10:13.181
My nigga.

10:13.598 --> 10:16.142
Roll your window down. Start there.

10:18.144 --> 10:21.898
- Got to hear it, smell it, taste it.
- Right.

10:22.649 --> 10:24.359
How's your <i>Español</i> ?

10:25.860 --> 10:27.111
Learn that shit.

10:27.904 --> 10:29.572
That will get you killed.

10:29.781 --> 10:32.909
They plot all kinds of shit
behind your back.

10:33.284 --> 10:37.497
You gonna teach me that
old-school Rodney King shit?

10:37.705 --> 10:40.416
We don't roll like that no more.

10:40.625 --> 10:41.959
Now we use this.

10:42.168 --> 10:44.253
These niggas are too strong.

10:44.462 --> 10:47.715
- Think I'm crazy?
- I don't know what to think.

10:47.924 --> 10:49.634
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:50.218 --> 10:51.427
Good.

10:56.099 --> 10:57.100
Good.

11:07.151 --> 11:08.486
Been married long?

11:08.695 --> 11:10.446
- About a year.
- Yeah?

11:10.655 --> 11:13.533
- You got a kid?
- A girl, 9 months.

11:14.325 --> 11:17.453
I got four. Boys.

11:17.662 --> 11:20.999
You need a son,
I'll hook your lady up. Can't miss.

11:22.208 --> 11:26.337
Can we not talk
about my family, all right?

11:26.546 --> 11:27.547
I respect that.

11:28.339 --> 11:31.092
I'm married, I got my queen too.

11:31.551 --> 11:33.761
I remember having a young bride.

11:34.012 --> 11:37.223
You probably fuck her face-to-face,
don't you?

11:37.432 --> 11:39.100
Let's not talk about her.

11:39.350 --> 11:43.062
That's my point. You're so in love,
it's coming right out.

11:43.563 --> 11:46.190
The day you bring
that here is the day...

11:46.399 --> 11:50.153
...you don't make it back.
Hide it deep inside of you.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.739
The maggots out here
will find it...

11:52.947 --> 11:55.575
...use it against you
and chew you up.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.077
Never wear the ring to work.

11:59.412 --> 12:01.706
- I'm serious about that.
- Thanks.

12:33.446 --> 12:34.822
What's here?

12:37.116 --> 12:38.284
Transactions.

12:39.577 --> 12:44.248
You see that guy trying to act
like he's not slanging dope?

12:44.499 --> 12:47.543
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.

12:47.752 --> 12:50.296
That's my boy, Neto.

12:50.922 --> 12:52.757
Only 17, but he can kill.

12:53.466 --> 12:55.593
- Works for me.
- He's an informer?

12:55.802 --> 12:57.887
Teammate. I got eyes everywhere.

12:58.096 --> 13:03.226
He gets to make some cash.
Lets me know when big things happen.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.311
Big transactions.

13:08.940 --> 13:11.234
- You trust him?
- Damn right I do.

13:11.442 --> 13:15.905
Sprung his mom from INS detention.
Here we go. Watch this.

13:18.116 --> 13:22.620
That's right. Come on down.

13:22.829 --> 13:26.082
Come on. Look at it. Sexy, ain't it?

13:27.500 --> 13:29.002
That's right.

13:30.378 --> 13:32.630
- See the hand-to-hand?
- I saw it.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.134
- When was your last felony stop?
- Two weeks ago.

13:36.342 --> 13:37.427
You need practice.

13:37.635 --> 13:40.972
- College kids.
- They'll get an education today.

13:41.180 --> 13:44.308
I want them grabbing glass.
You take the back.

13:44.517 --> 13:47.270
Stay off of the Rover.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.938
Let's go.

13:53.192 --> 13:56.279
- You little fuckers.
- Run, baby, run.

14:09.709 --> 14:12.003
Police! Let's see your hands!

14:12.211 --> 14:13.963
Put them up! Put them up!

14:14.172 --> 14:16.716
Put your hands on the windshield!

14:16.924 --> 14:21.512
- Put your hands on the glass.
- Driver, put it in park!

14:21.721 --> 14:25.892
- It's a stick shift!
- Throw the keys out the window!

14:26.267 --> 14:28.478
Put your hands on your chest!

14:30.396 --> 14:32.607
All right, fork it over.

14:32.815 --> 14:33.983
- What?
- You know.

14:34.192 --> 14:36.819
The marijuana. Give it to me!

14:37.028 --> 14:39.155
- Give it!
- Sorry, sir.

14:39.364 --> 14:44.160
- Shut up! Give me that pipe.
- My mom gave me that pipe.

14:44.369 --> 14:48.706
She can pick it up in jail.
Give me the cigarettes too.

14:48.956 --> 14:52.293
- Control your suspect!
- Palms on the glass!

14:52.502 --> 14:57.548
Move the hands, I'll slap you!
Face against the glass! Right there!

14:59.217 --> 15:01.803
You know this is a gang neighborhood?

15:02.428 --> 15:05.807
- Yeah!
- Then don't come down here.

15:06.015 --> 15:10.728
I see you down here again,
I'll make you walk home.

15:10.979 --> 15:15.149
I'll let the homeboys run
a train on her. Know what that is?

15:15.483 --> 15:17.527
Yes, sir.

15:17.735 --> 15:22.448
All right, gentlemen.
Thanks for your cooperation.

15:23.157 --> 15:26.077
Let's go. Safe your iron, son.

15:27.870 --> 15:29.080
Shit!

15:39.757 --> 15:41.384
I like that shit.

15:41.592 --> 15:44.679
I like how you move.
You were trained well.

15:44.887 --> 15:49.851
Check that out. It's a bad dime.
See the hairs, undeveloped seeds.

15:50.059 --> 15:51.978
You see how immature it is.

15:52.186 --> 15:54.605
That's classic Mexican garbage.

15:54.814 --> 15:57.817
Let me see. It's old.
Probably last year's.

15:58.443 --> 15:59.569
To be truly effective...

15:59.777 --> 16:04.907
...a good narcotics agent
must know and love narcotics.

16:05.158 --> 16:07.744
A good narcotics agent should have...

16:07.952 --> 16:10.121
...narcotics in his blood.

16:11.581 --> 16:14.459
- What, you gonna smoke that?
- No, you are.

16:16.294 --> 16:18.254
- Hell if I am!
- Yes.

16:18.713 --> 16:20.173
- You're not?
- No.

16:20.381 --> 16:23.134
- Why? You a Mormon?
- I'm not losing my job.

16:23.343 --> 16:24.510
This is your job.

16:24.719 --> 16:26.262
- Smoke it.
- No.

16:26.471 --> 16:28.473
This ain't a test. Take a hit.

16:29.766 --> 16:33.603
Listen, I became a cop
to stop people from using...

16:34.979 --> 16:38.316
- That ain't cocaine. Take a hit.
- No, man.

16:42.070 --> 16:44.739
- Jesus Christ!
- Yeah, right.

16:45.406 --> 16:47.659
If I was a dealer, you'd be dead!

16:47.909 --> 16:51.454
Turn shit down out here,
and your wife gets a flag.

16:51.663 --> 16:53.206
What's wrong with you?

16:54.832 --> 16:56.000
You know what?

16:56.209 --> 17:01.297
I don't want you in my unit.
Get the fuck out of my car, rookie.

17:03.341 --> 17:04.342
Poo butt-ass.

17:08.179 --> 17:11.848
- What's the holdup?
- Move it!

17:12.058 --> 17:13.476
Give me that thing.

17:14.268 --> 17:16.436
I'll smoke it. Give it to me.

17:18.815 --> 17:20.733
You want me to, I'll smoke it.

17:33.162 --> 17:37.333
Virgin lungs. Man up now.
Man up, nigga. Man up.

17:37.709 --> 17:38.876
Go ahead. Get it.

17:39.085 --> 17:42.588
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up and just wait!

17:50.596 --> 17:53.933
- Man the fuck up! Finish that shit!
- Geronimo.

17:58.938 --> 18:01.024
Let's go, nigga. Let's go.

18:52.283 --> 18:55.578
Oh, shit!

19:06.339 --> 19:08.341
You okay, kid?

19:08.591 --> 19:13.346
That's a man size hit you took.
When's the last time you smoked weed?

19:14.931 --> 19:17.016
The last... Twelfth grade.

19:17.433 --> 19:19.018
We were...

19:20.311 --> 19:22.855
- Well, we were...
- Smoking weed.

19:23.064 --> 19:24.565
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:26.859 --> 19:29.904
Left that out of your service jacket.

19:30.113 --> 19:33.282
I know you got secrets.
Everybody got secrets.

19:33.491 --> 19:37.620
- Didn't know you liked it wet, though.
- What's wet?

19:37.870 --> 19:43.001
Butt-naked. Ill. Sherm. Dust.

19:43.209 --> 19:47.922
PCP. Primos. P-dog.

19:48.464 --> 19:50.216
That's what you had.

19:51.009 --> 19:52.885
You couldn't taste it?

19:55.179 --> 19:58.516
- I never done it.
- I haven't, but you have now.

20:04.897 --> 20:06.441
Shit!

20:06.858 --> 20:10.028
Shit. I'll get piss-tested,
and I'll get fired.

20:10.278 --> 20:13.281
The boss has our back.
We know before we piss.

20:15.575 --> 20:17.869
- Shit!
- Boom!

20:18.077 --> 20:19.537
Why did you do this?

20:19.746 --> 20:22.498
You're an adult.
Nobody made you smoke.

20:23.374 --> 20:25.752
You made a decision. Live with it.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.714
Not like I put a gun to your head.

20:34.844 --> 20:35.928
Man...

20:50.109 --> 20:54.280
- Oh, man, shit.
- Come on, get your shit together now.

20:55.114 --> 20:56.866
This is my dog's house.

20:57.116 --> 20:59.410
We'll see what he thinks of you.

21:10.755 --> 21:14.133
- Get your ass in here!
- Roger, what's up?

21:14.342 --> 21:16.928
- How are they treating you?
- All right.

21:17.136 --> 21:20.014
- I didn't wake you up?
- I never sleep.

21:20.223 --> 21:22.350
Right. This my new guy, Jake.

21:22.558 --> 21:24.143
Come on. Get in here.

21:24.352 --> 21:27.897
Yeah. Time to get my swerve on here!

21:28.106 --> 21:30.525
- What you drinking?
- The best.

21:30.733 --> 21:33.653
The best, I know. Best for the best.

21:34.112 --> 21:37.824
I heard about Vegas.
Got a green light on your ass.

21:38.032 --> 21:39.575
No problem.

21:39.826 --> 21:42.328
Russians want you. I got your back.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.706
I know that. Thank you.

21:46.624 --> 21:50.545
Here. Get that medicine up in you.

21:53.339 --> 21:55.967
- Back to the world.
- Back to the world.

21:59.804 --> 22:03.141
Went and got yourself
a daisy-fresh rookie.

22:10.398 --> 22:14.569
He's high as a motherfucker.
What did you give him?

22:14.777 --> 22:17.363
- A little of Mexico's finest.
- Yeah.

22:22.410 --> 22:23.828
Garbage.

22:24.620 --> 22:27.206
- Where'd you grow up?
- North Hollywood.

22:27.415 --> 22:29.375
- What's your last name?
- Hoyt.

22:29.584 --> 22:33.671
Hoyt. Hoyt...

22:34.756 --> 22:38.009
- Strong safety, North Hollywood High.
- Right.

22:39.135 --> 22:41.596
- How'd you know that?
- How did you?

22:42.138 --> 22:45.808
- I follow all the good players.
- No doubt.

22:46.017 --> 22:48.770
Excuse me. Shit.

22:49.854 --> 22:53.358
- Strong safety, huh?
- It's me. What's up?

22:54.442 --> 22:58.821
I can't do anything.
Clean up your own mess. Don't call me.

22:59.656 --> 23:04.077
Hey! Here's a joke, boy.

23:04.702 --> 23:09.832
Man walks out of his house,
sees this snail lying on his porch.

23:10.041 --> 23:13.920
So he picks it up,
chucks it into the backyard.

23:14.128 --> 23:18.591
Snail bounces off a rock,
busts its shell up all to shit...

23:18.841 --> 23:20.510
...lands in the grass.

23:20.718 --> 23:24.097
Snail lies there dying.

23:26.057 --> 23:27.225
But...

23:27.433 --> 23:30.603
...snail doesn't die.
Soon it can crawl again.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.564
And one day...

23:35.233 --> 23:38.569
...snail heads back
to the front of the house.

23:38.778 --> 23:42.865
Finally, after about a year...

23:43.074 --> 23:46.160
...the little guy crawls
back on the porch.

23:46.369 --> 23:49.455
Right then the man walks
out of his house...

23:50.123 --> 23:51.833
...sees this snail again.

23:52.041 --> 23:53.584
So he looks at it...

23:53.793 --> 23:55.628
...and he says:

23:58.006 --> 24:00.091
"The fuck's your problem?"

24:06.472 --> 24:08.558
That's not funny.

24:08.766 --> 24:10.977
What you laughing for then?

24:11.185 --> 24:14.605
- I don't know, man. I...
- Hey!

24:14.814 --> 24:18.526
Figure that joke out,
you'll figure the streets out.

24:19.485 --> 24:22.989
Nothing to figure out.
It's senseless bullshit.

24:23.197 --> 24:27.618
- You know... I already figured it out.
- Really?

24:27.827 --> 24:31.414
- Yeah.
- You already figured the streets out?

24:31.622 --> 24:35.460
Well, it's all about smiles and cries.

24:36.085 --> 24:39.130
- Put the drink down. What is that?
- Hold on!

24:39.339 --> 24:41.007
Hold on. Smiles and cries.

24:41.257 --> 24:44.761
Smiles and cries.
Smiles and cries. I hear you.

24:45.428 --> 24:49.390
Yeah, you gotta control
your smiles and cries...

24:49.641 --> 24:53.853
...because that's all you have,
and nobody can take that away.

24:56.147 --> 24:58.107
Oh, shit.

25:02.904 --> 25:08.117
What you think, dog? Think this
greenhorn can handle undercover?

25:09.243 --> 25:13.998
You were just like him.
Same silly-ass look and everything.

25:14.207 --> 25:16.125
Saving the goddamn world.

25:17.168 --> 25:20.838
Now that's some smiles
and cries for your ass!

25:21.047 --> 25:23.716
- That was you.
- Shit lasted a week.

25:24.550 --> 25:25.885
Gotta get back to it.

25:26.469 --> 25:27.804
Thanks for the snort.

25:28.012 --> 25:29.472
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

25:29.681 --> 25:31.808
Yes, sir. What you doing later?

25:32.016 --> 25:33.977
Stay home. Save some cheddar.

25:34.185 --> 25:39.148
My dream's less than a year away.
Philippine Islands, here I come.

25:39.357 --> 25:41.359
- Let me go too.
- You're invited.

25:57.041 --> 26:02.296
Hey. Open your eyes, man.
You'll feel a lot better.

26:06.759 --> 26:09.762
Boom! Come on, man. Sit your ass up.

26:16.227 --> 26:17.228
Who are you?

26:19.731 --> 26:22.275
I'm the Zig-Zag man. Who are you?

26:22.525 --> 26:25.653
- I'm a cop. Watch out!
- Don't shoot nobody.

26:25.862 --> 26:28.281
Get that beer in you for ballast.

26:28.865 --> 26:32.243
- No, man.
- Get it in you. You'll feel better.

26:49.969 --> 26:50.970
Stop the car!

26:51.179 --> 26:53.181
Stop the car! I saw something!

26:53.389 --> 26:54.807
- Just relax.
- Stop!

26:55.016 --> 26:57.977
All right! Hold the fuck on... Hey!

27:04.651 --> 27:06.903
Fuck me, man! Shit.

27:09.322 --> 27:12.075
Police officer!
Get away from the girl!

27:12.283 --> 27:15.203
- I'm gonna fuck you too, cop!
- Get the...

27:48.987 --> 27:51.531
We didn't do shit! Bitch is crazy!

27:55.702 --> 27:58.538
Roll over, man. Roll the fuck over!

27:59.247 --> 28:00.540
Fucking ass prick!

28:04.752 --> 28:06.295
My nigga!

28:06.504 --> 28:09.382
Go ahead, cowboy,
you got mad squabbles.

28:10.466 --> 28:13.678
- Thanks for the help.
- You should've shot them.

28:14.053 --> 28:15.221
What's happening?

28:15.430 --> 28:17.807
- You're dead!
- Okay! Wait! Hold it!

28:18.016 --> 28:19.934
- You too, white boy!
- Okay...

28:20.184 --> 28:23.396
- My cousins will blast you fools!
- Calm down.

28:23.604 --> 28:25.940
- Calm down. You okay?
- No, I'm not!

28:26.149 --> 28:28.151
- Look at my nose!
- I see it.

28:28.359 --> 28:32.155
Put ice on it. You'll be fine.
What're you doing here?

28:32.363 --> 28:34.907
- I was just...
- They probably got AIDS.

28:35.116 --> 28:36.701
Why you not at school?

28:36.909 --> 28:39.203
I was going to a ditch party and...

28:39.412 --> 28:41.873
You almost became the ditch party.

28:42.081 --> 28:44.709
- Where your cousins from?
- Hillside <i>Trece</i>!

28:44.917 --> 28:48.629
- Remember that!
- Tell your cousins to get your back.

28:48.838 --> 28:51.049
Grab your bag and go home now.

28:51.257 --> 28:54.635
- No! I need a statement...
- Don't need no statement.

28:54.844 --> 28:58.014
- They'll fuck you up.
- We gonna let them go?

28:58.222 --> 29:00.600
You wanna beat them up, go ahead.

29:00.850 --> 29:04.854
I got a punching bag at home.
They should be off the streets.

29:05.563 --> 29:06.731
You hear that?

29:07.523 --> 29:10.735
- Wanna go home or to jail?
- What you think?

29:12.737 --> 29:15.740
Got room at the booty house.
You been there?

29:17.742 --> 29:20.370
- You'll grab your ankles.
- Suck my dick!

29:20.578 --> 29:23.581
- I know people.
- That's how it starts.

29:23.831 --> 29:26.125
What about you? What you got?

29:26.334 --> 29:27.919
- Got nothing?
- No.

29:28.127 --> 29:29.462
- You sure?
- Yeah.

29:29.671 --> 29:32.882
- Where's your horn?
- Got none.

29:35.927 --> 29:37.720
You got money, though.

29:37.929 --> 29:41.599
You lied to me!

29:42.725 --> 29:44.936
Lucky I don't make you eat that.

29:45.603 --> 29:49.774
Stand up, you. Stand the fuck up!

29:55.613 --> 29:57.824
Yeah. Oh, shit, huh?

30:05.665 --> 30:08.751
Turn around, sucker. Turn around.

30:10.336 --> 30:12.296
So you like raping girls?

30:13.923 --> 30:16.009
- Like to rape girls?
- No, man.

30:16.217 --> 30:18.302
- That's what you like?
- No...

30:19.887 --> 30:21.973
That what you like? Don't lie.

30:22.181 --> 30:25.643
Told me to suck your dick.
Is that what you said?

30:27.478 --> 30:28.646
Look at me.

30:29.647 --> 30:32.650
You wanted me
to suck your dick, right?

30:32.859 --> 30:35.069
Isn't that what you said?

30:35.278 --> 30:38.614
Didn't you say suck it?
Don't lie. Am I a liar?

30:38.865 --> 30:40.158
You didn't say that?

30:40.366 --> 30:43.995
That's not what you said?
So I'm lying?

30:44.203 --> 30:47.498
- No, please!
- Where is it? I can't find it.

30:48.249 --> 30:50.001
Pull your pants down.

30:53.671 --> 30:56.924
Which nut you want?
I'll leave you one.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.095
Your choice. Just make a decision.

31:01.721 --> 31:05.433
All right.
Put your hands on your head.

31:07.226 --> 31:11.272
Close your eyes. Close your eyes.

31:15.860 --> 31:17.654
Lucky I got other business.

31:17.862 --> 31:23.409
I'd cut your fucking dick off
and stick it up your funky ass. Bitch.

31:23.618 --> 31:27.664
Damn! I'm thirsty.
I want a beer. What about you?

31:28.039 --> 31:29.540
You want a beer?

31:33.711 --> 31:36.047
I'm gonna leave you three to it.

31:42.220 --> 31:44.097
Pussy-ass bitch!

31:44.305 --> 31:47.058
I see you again, I'll fuck you up!

31:47.850 --> 31:49.727
You won't see shit coming!

31:49.936 --> 31:53.439
I'll dent your mouth,
I'll crack your head open.

31:53.648 --> 31:55.316
You fucking pig! Come on!

32:07.203 --> 32:10.039
- That girl's 14.
- She all woman, though.

32:10.248 --> 32:13.960
You tax that ass for days, man!
Keep walking, bitch!

32:25.096 --> 32:26.347
You want a beer?

32:27.682 --> 32:31.352
- No, I don't want a beer, man.
- No? You mad?

32:43.781 --> 32:45.742
Want to book that $60, huh?

32:45.950 --> 32:48.619
Here, go ahead, book it into evidence.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.372
Where the suspects? Go get them.

32:51.581 --> 32:53.291
You let them go.

32:53.499 --> 32:55.084
- I let them go?
- You did.

32:55.293 --> 32:58.463
You want to run and gun,
stay in Patrol.

32:58.713 --> 33:00.590
This is Investigations.

33:00.840 --> 33:02.633
Garbage men handle garbage.

33:02.842 --> 33:05.595
Professional anglers
go after the big fish.

33:05.803 --> 33:08.306
Chasing them crackhead
motherfuckers...

33:08.514 --> 33:11.184
- They'd have killed you.
- They belong in jail.

33:11.392 --> 33:13.978
Why? They got beaten,
lost their money.

33:14.312 --> 33:17.649
Hillside's <i>éses</i> will smoke them.
What more you want?

33:17.899 --> 33:19.859
- I want justice.
- That's not justice?

33:20.318 --> 33:22.028
- That's street justice.
- So?

33:22.236 --> 33:24.572
- Let them kill each other?
- God willing.

33:24.947 --> 33:27.158
Fuck them!
Everybody looking like them.

33:27.367 --> 33:29.410
Reality is, the good guys...

33:29.619 --> 33:32.830
...they die first.
The school kids and moms...

33:33.081 --> 33:36.417
...family men, don't want to catch
any bullets.

33:36.626 --> 33:40.213
To protect the sheep,
you got to catch the wolf.

33:40.421 --> 33:43.299
It takes a wolf to catch a wolf,
understand?

33:43.591 --> 33:44.550
What?

33:44.759 --> 33:47.804
- Protect the sheep by killing wolves.
- I heard you.

33:48.012 --> 33:50.807
- You didn't hear me.
- All right. Whatever.

33:51.015 --> 33:52.767
Whatever the fuck-ever!

34:05.113 --> 34:09.367
Do you ever lock anybody up?
You seem busy keeping people out.

34:09.574 --> 34:11.202
You don't know shit!

34:11.411 --> 34:14.914
Shit, they build jails because of me!

34:15.206 --> 34:19.335
Judges gave over 15,000 man-years
of incarceration time...

34:19.543 --> 34:23.089
...based on my cases.
My record speaks for itself.

34:23.297 --> 34:25.216
How many felons have you got?

34:27.467 --> 34:28.761
I rest my case.

34:34.309 --> 34:39.480
- I'm not smoking crack, all right?
- I'm glad. Put it in the glove box.

34:39.981 --> 34:41.858
Put the $60 in there too.

34:42.065 --> 34:46.446
That'll come in handy.
We'll use it like a credit card.

34:55.163 --> 34:58.416
No matter what I say,
you did the right thing.

35:00.835 --> 35:04.756
Reminds me when I was
chasing down bad guys.

35:04.964 --> 35:07.592
Pretty amazing shit you did
back there.

35:09.594 --> 35:10.887
Thanks.

35:11.471 --> 35:14.974
I noticed you applied that chokehold
though, huh?

35:16.059 --> 35:17.852
That's a no-no procedure.

35:19.729 --> 35:23.566
- I was getting my ass kicked.
- You did what you had to do.

35:23.775 --> 35:26.402
You did what you had to do.

35:27.820 --> 35:29.155
That's right.

35:32.533 --> 35:35.036
What a wolf does. You a wolf?

35:36.162 --> 35:38.956
Come on, wolf! Come on, dog!

35:41.959 --> 35:45.088
No, I said a wolf,
not a rooster, a wolf.

35:49.133 --> 35:52.512
- That's a rooster, give me a wolf!
- Give me a beer!

35:52.762 --> 35:54.973
There you go! That's my nigga.

35:56.557 --> 35:58.601
You got the magic eye, Hoyt.

35:58.810 --> 36:01.854
You have the magic eye.

36:02.271 --> 36:04.065
You up your street IQ...

36:04.315 --> 36:06.901
...you'll do some damage,
I guarantee.

36:09.028 --> 36:10.029
Crime fighter.

36:53.031 --> 36:54.699
- What you need?
- Crack.

36:55.867 --> 36:57.827
- Uh, 20 bucks...
- Crack?

37:00.330 --> 37:04.250
Smell like bacon!
Do I look like a sucker to you, nigga?

37:05.251 --> 37:06.919
Fuck you, rookie!

37:12.050 --> 37:13.092
Go fetch, dog.

37:13.509 --> 37:15.178
You want me to...

37:17.055 --> 37:20.058
Oh, come on, man, it's...

37:26.397 --> 37:28.733
Give me a break! Hey, you! Slow up!

37:34.155 --> 37:35.323
Come on, stop!

37:35.531 --> 37:39.243
Police officer! Police officer! Stop!
Come on, man!

37:39.452 --> 37:40.953
Give me a break! Shit!

37:41.204 --> 37:45.249
Get out! Get out of here
or I call police.

37:46.417 --> 37:50.254
Police officer, ma'am, calm down.
I said stop! Stop!

37:50.463 --> 37:52.632
Get the fuck off me. Fuck off.

37:58.554 --> 38:01.933
You're making this so much harder!
Just calm down!

38:08.690 --> 38:10.650
You love this shit, huh?

38:11.484 --> 38:13.361
Hey, man, hey!

38:14.070 --> 38:15.071
Pick him up!

38:15.279 --> 38:18.533
Civil rights violating motherfuckers!

38:18.741 --> 38:19.784
Fuck!

38:20.576 --> 38:23.913
- Watch the fucking legs, man!
- Pick his legs up.

38:24.122 --> 38:28.167
Ain't got nothing better to do
than fuck with me, man? Shit!

38:31.546 --> 38:33.006
Who you working for?

38:33.214 --> 38:36.009
I ain't work for nobody!
I'm on disability!

38:36.217 --> 38:38.136
Shit! You know you cracking.

38:38.344 --> 38:40.138
I don't sell no more.

38:41.222 --> 38:42.682
- No rocks?
- No rocks.

38:43.474 --> 38:45.810
- But I found this.
- No, you don't.

38:46.019 --> 38:49.188
That motherfucker planted
that shit on me.

38:49.397 --> 38:52.608
Put me in the front seat,
I'll whup his ass!

38:55.069 --> 38:56.487
Who you working for?

38:56.696 --> 39:00.450
Told you I don't work for nobody, man!

39:01.034 --> 39:02.076
Where the rocks?

39:02.535 --> 39:04.829
I got nothing on me.
I gave it up.

39:08.666 --> 39:09.667
Where the rocks?

39:11.669 --> 39:12.837
Open your mouth.

39:13.254 --> 39:14.547
You a doctor now?

39:14.756 --> 39:16.341
A dentist. Open it.

39:17.508 --> 39:18.843
Lift up your tongue.

39:20.470 --> 39:24.015
Your partner already searched me.
I'm straight.

39:24.223 --> 39:25.850
Yeah, okay.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.353
You got a pen, got a writing pen?

39:29.479 --> 39:32.023
Didn't see the motherfucker coming!

39:33.691 --> 39:35.026
Nothing in there?

39:37.862 --> 39:39.280
Nothing, man!

39:39.489 --> 39:41.157
Ain't got nothing, huh?

39:44.035 --> 39:45.536
God!

39:46.079 --> 39:48.414
- Damn!
- Now what is that?

39:48.623 --> 39:51.334
- Crack, man!
- Right. Jimmy crack corn.

39:51.584 --> 39:53.795
One, two, three, four, five, six.

39:54.003 --> 39:56.422
Oh, you federally fucked now.

39:56.881 --> 39:59.717
You got crack and a gun.

39:59.926 --> 40:03.680
With your record you'll get
10 years per bullet, you know?

40:03.888 --> 40:05.431
Give me a name, now.

40:06.140 --> 40:09.394
- You know I ain't no snitch!
- I know you ain't.

40:10.395 --> 40:11.437
Give me a name.

40:12.480 --> 40:14.190
- Twenty. A name!
- Fuck!

40:15.483 --> 40:17.193
That's 30 years!

40:17.485 --> 40:19.862
You want to go to jail or go home?

40:20.905 --> 40:22.365
- He in County.
- Who?

40:23.157 --> 40:26.869
This nigga named Sandman.
That's all I know! Shit!

40:27.120 --> 40:28.162
Sandman?

40:29.122 --> 40:30.581
See how easy it was?

40:34.377 --> 40:36.963
- Unhook him.
- Sick of this shit, man!

40:37.171 --> 40:38.715
Want the evidence?

40:38.923 --> 40:41.050
- Fuck that, man.
- My nigga.

40:56.190 --> 40:57.442
<i>- It's Bob.</i>
- Hello.

40:57.650 --> 40:59.319
<i>- How's it going?</i>
- It's Alonzo.

40:59.527 --> 41:01.154
- Got your gang book?
<i>- Why?</i>

41:01.404 --> 41:05.366
I need a res on a Sandman.
He may be in custody.

41:05.575 --> 41:07.869
<i>- Hold on. I'll check.</i>
- No problem.

41:08.077 --> 41:11.080
That doesn't fly anymore.
Shoving a pen down.

41:11.289 --> 41:13.624
- What if he complains?
- To who?

41:13.875 --> 41:18.421
<i>23130, 113th Street.</i>
<i>Kevin Miller, a.k.a. Sandman. Got it?</i>

41:18.629 --> 41:20.256
I know where it is.

41:20.465 --> 41:23.968
- Out there by Imperial Courts?
<i>- Exactly, uh-huh.</i>

41:24.177 --> 41:26.012
- Thanks a lot.
<i>- No problem.</i>

41:28.723 --> 41:31.476
- We go after Sandman?
- We go after him.

42:20.024 --> 42:21.526
Opening a Circuit City?

42:21.734 --> 42:24.153
No, unclaimed shit from Property.

42:24.362 --> 42:27.490
Hand it out to my CI's, witnesses,
victims.

42:27.699 --> 42:30.868
Try to help out their families.
Put this on.

42:32.412 --> 42:33.871
Come on, let's go.

42:34.372 --> 42:39.711
Intel says she lives here alone.
She got two female juveniles...

42:39.919 --> 42:41.671
...possibly a male juvenile.

42:41.879 --> 42:45.300
- If he's not here, why are we?
- To serve this warrant.

42:45.550 --> 42:49.137
- We can't do that.
- Yes, we can. We the police.

42:49.345 --> 42:51.723
- Why not get a real warrant?
- We trying to get shit done.

42:51.931 --> 42:54.684
Stand over there
and don't get me killed.

42:57.895 --> 43:01.190
- Police, we got a search warrant!
- L.A.P.D., open up!

43:02.483 --> 43:04.402
Kevin ain't here!

43:04.610 --> 43:06.863
Just open the door!

43:07.071 --> 43:08.614
Kevin ain't here!

43:08.823 --> 43:12.118
- Open the door, ma'am!
- He ain't even here!

43:12.910 --> 43:15.246
I said Kevin ain't even over here!

43:15.455 --> 43:17.707
We got a search warrant.
Open up.

43:18.416 --> 43:19.876
Ain't nobody here!

43:20.376 --> 43:23.046
Get your big ass down!
Right down! Down!

43:23.296 --> 43:26.090
Don't move, spread them out!
Don't move!

43:26.341 --> 43:29.427
Anybody in the house?
Is anybody in the house?!

43:29.636 --> 43:32.388
My nephew, Dimitri! In the bedroom!

43:32.639 --> 43:36.643
Okay. I'm gonna clear the house,
check it for weapons.

43:45.985 --> 43:47.487
Kitchen's clear!

43:58.081 --> 43:59.290
- Dimitri?
- Yeah?

43:59.957 --> 44:02.001
Put your hands up, son.

44:02.627 --> 44:04.128
- Anybody else?
- No.

44:04.337 --> 44:06.005
- You sure?
- Yeah.

44:06.714 --> 44:10.635
Okay, just stay right there.
Don't move! Don't you move.

44:11.219 --> 44:14.263
Stand up. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

44:14.472 --> 44:17.934
Sit down and place them
on your knees.

44:18.142 --> 44:20.311
Sit down. We're the good guys.

44:20.812 --> 44:24.232
Just sit down right over there
next to your auntie.

44:24.440 --> 44:25.733
Right over there.

44:26.192 --> 44:28.861
House is Code-4.
I'm starting the search.

44:41.416 --> 44:43.835
- I wanna see that warrant.
- The what?

44:44.043 --> 44:45.795
The warrant. I need a copy.

44:46.004 --> 44:48.881
My partner has it.
He'll be out soon.

44:50.842 --> 44:52.218
Where's your backup?

44:53.428 --> 44:57.181
Just be quiet until we're through
with our investigation.

44:57.390 --> 45:00.351
- You got the gun, don't you?
- That's right.

45:00.560 --> 45:03.438
Punk-ass, bitch-ass, crooked-ass cop!

45:04.939 --> 45:06.065
You a rookie.

45:07.233 --> 45:09.068
Give me a break, okay?

45:14.782 --> 45:16.367
How you doing over there?

45:16.576 --> 45:20.496
You cool? Come on.
Don't worry about it, you're cool.

45:20.830 --> 45:22.540
Just stay cool.

45:23.583 --> 45:24.667
All right.

45:29.380 --> 45:33.092
- Ma'am, please sit down.
- You act like you pay the rent!

45:33.301 --> 45:35.053
- Sit down!
- You all stink!

45:35.261 --> 45:37.805
You gotta get drunk to come
up here!

45:38.014 --> 45:39.974
- Sit down now!
- Y'all stink!

45:40.308 --> 45:42.435
You're gonna shoot me, boss?

45:45.104 --> 45:48.316
Close your eyes.
This punk cop is gonna shoot me!

45:48.524 --> 45:50.568
- Sit down, right now!
- Okay.

45:50.777 --> 45:52.487
Okay! Everything is fine.

45:52.820 --> 45:54.489
We made a mistake.

45:55.865 --> 45:59.786
Didn't find a damn thing.
I'm very sorry.

46:00.161 --> 46:02.497
Thanks for your cooperation.
Let's go.

46:02.830 --> 46:04.874
- Show me that warrant.
- What?

46:05.083 --> 46:07.960
I want to see that goddamn warrant!

46:11.172 --> 46:13.257
Here you go. Let's go!

46:17.762 --> 46:18.972
Shit!

46:22.433 --> 46:23.643
Motherfuckers!

46:24.102 --> 46:27.438
Hey, jackers! Give me my money back.

46:27.647 --> 46:30.733
You ain't no police!
Give me my money back!

46:30.984 --> 46:35.238
Jackers, why you all standing
over there?! Blast them fools!

46:35.446 --> 46:38.199
You ain't no police!

46:38.408 --> 46:40.368
I want my money back!

46:40.576 --> 46:42.286
Start, you motherfucker!

46:42.745 --> 46:44.038
Fuck! Gun!

46:44.247 --> 46:46.874
- Just get out of here!
- Stay in the car!

46:51.587 --> 46:53.298
Yeah, motherfuckers!

47:15.570 --> 47:19.115
That was not cool, all right?
That was not cool at all!

47:19.324 --> 47:21.534
Opening fire in a neighborhood.

47:21.743 --> 47:25.955
Where was the Sandman?
What were you doing back there?

47:26.164 --> 47:31.461
Checking for narcotics activity.
Drugs, guns, baggies, you know?

47:31.669 --> 47:34.088
- Yeah, cash!
- Speak on it, son.

47:34.297 --> 47:36.924
- She's screaming about money...
- Bullshit.

47:37.133 --> 47:39.719
She's screaming
about having us killed!

47:39.927 --> 47:44.974
I'll be on the 6:00 news
in handcuffs because of you.

47:45.183 --> 47:48.603
With the scandals,
it is open season on misconduct.

47:48.811 --> 47:51.522
- They'll nail us to the wall.
- Pull over.

47:52.523 --> 47:54.108
- Pull over.
- Here?

47:54.359 --> 47:56.152
- Yeah, pull over.
- Shit!

48:15.755 --> 48:16.756
What?

48:19.092 --> 48:20.093
Listen.

48:21.052 --> 48:23.680
You're in a privileged position
to learn.

48:23.888 --> 48:25.932
Keep your mouth shut, eyes open.

48:26.140 --> 48:29.352
Want to do some good,
this is the place to learn.

48:29.727 --> 48:33.690
You can't take it, maybe you
should go back to your division.

48:33.940 --> 48:38.403
Get a nice job lighting flares
or measuring car wrecks.

48:39.028 --> 48:42.615
You got to decide
whether you're a wolf...

48:43.741 --> 48:45.201
...or a sheep.

48:49.622 --> 48:52.250
Get your ink...

48:55.920 --> 48:57.672
...or go give him a hand.

49:28.286 --> 49:30.913
What are we doing here?
We'll get killed.

49:31.122 --> 49:34.751
- You know about this place?
- It's the Jungle, right?

49:34.959 --> 49:38.087
They say don't come with anything
less than a platoon.

49:48.056 --> 49:50.016
This is the heart of it.

49:50.475 --> 49:52.518
Jungle. Damu headquarters.

49:53.770 --> 49:55.188
Stoners.

49:55.396 --> 49:58.274
A lot of murder investigations
lead here.

49:58.650 --> 50:00.777
One way in, one way out.

50:01.402 --> 50:03.571
Thought we were going to eat.

50:03.946 --> 50:08.076
Don't ever come here without me.
I'm serious. For your safety.

50:13.831 --> 50:16.834
- How'd you get a golden pass?
- I treat them fair.

50:17.210 --> 50:20.672
They know if they cross the line,
I tax that ass.

50:34.352 --> 50:35.979
What's that, up there?

50:36.854 --> 50:40.191
They flipping pigeons
to signal I'm here.

51:07.844 --> 51:10.054
- What's up, Bone?
- What's up?

51:10.305 --> 51:12.140
- What's up?
- It's all good.

51:12.390 --> 51:15.768
I appreciate what you did
for my nephew.

51:15.977 --> 51:17.687
For sure. For sure.

51:19.981 --> 51:21.441
You better call me.

51:25.987 --> 51:28.281
I'm sick of it.
I can't stand him!

51:28.656 --> 51:32.118
- Who are they?
- Nobody. I got them under my thumb.

51:32.368 --> 51:36.414
- What's up, Alonzo?
- All right, Spider. What's happening?

51:36.622 --> 51:40.043
Hey, what's up, girl? Look at you.
Go ahead.

51:40.251 --> 51:42.545
All that jelly and no toast.

51:42.920 --> 51:46.382
- Who lives here?
- Just one of my lovelies.

51:46.591 --> 51:49.260
A loving touch, you know?
Don't worry.

52:14.577 --> 52:16.621
New guy, Jake.

52:18.956 --> 52:22.001
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to my house.

52:22.251 --> 52:25.755
- Give him some food. Take care of him.
- Of course.

52:28.591 --> 52:32.303
- Of course. How are you?
- Good, good.

52:34.013 --> 52:38.184
I have cable.
You watch whatever you want, okay?

52:38.643 --> 52:41.104
- Thanks.
- This is your house.

52:42.772 --> 52:44.232
I'll be right back.

52:53.992 --> 52:56.202
- How you doing?
- Fine.

53:02.625 --> 53:07.088
Now, this is all El Salvadorian food.

53:07.297 --> 53:09.173
Thank you. It looks great.

53:12.677 --> 53:13.636
I have to go.

53:14.178 --> 53:16.556
Yeah, all right.

54:01.643 --> 54:04.437
Let's go.
We got a meeting in 15 minutes.

54:05.063 --> 54:07.607
- I just need to...
- Forget it. Let's go.

54:08.858 --> 54:10.234
I'll see you, buddy.

54:39.263 --> 54:40.515
You okay?

55:18.845 --> 55:20.138
Here, use this.

55:21.389 --> 55:23.182
- Who's here?
- L.A.P.D.'s finest.

55:23.391 --> 55:25.768
Don't speak till you're spoken to.

55:26.019 --> 55:27.061
Come on.

55:44.537 --> 55:45.538
Good to see you.

55:45.747 --> 55:49.876
That's my new guy. Jake Hoyt.
Captain Lou Jacobs.

55:50.084 --> 55:52.712
Need to talk to the feds,
go to him first.

55:52.962 --> 55:54.797
He'll take your back for you.

55:55.048 --> 55:57.800
Stan Gursky,
he runs the D.A. Shooting team.

55:58.009 --> 56:00.637
Think about him
before you shoot someone.

56:00.845 --> 56:04.182
If you're wrong,
he'll use your nuts for dice.

56:04.390 --> 56:07.518
Right here,
Detective Doug Rosselli...

56:07.727 --> 56:11.522
...handles theft cases
for the French-poodle crowd.

56:11.773 --> 56:13.775
He's a good man.

56:13.983 --> 56:16.361
- Pleased to meet you.
- Good man.

56:17.362 --> 56:18.988
- Should I...?
- Shoo.

56:19.197 --> 56:21.491
Get yourself a steak or something.

56:22.617 --> 56:24.410
All right, gents.

56:25.536 --> 56:29.415
I don't know why I'm meeting you.
I don't talk to dead men.

56:30.041 --> 56:31.668
I ain't dead yet.

56:31.918 --> 56:34.629
Fucking prick. Excuse me.

56:36.965 --> 56:38.508
Why the long face, Doug?

56:39.092 --> 56:42.720
- Feds seize your house or something?
- Fuck yourself.

56:43.429 --> 56:45.098
Tell him the story.

56:45.807 --> 56:47.350
Come on, tell the story.

56:47.558 --> 56:51.312
- If it's so funny, you tell him.
- It's your story.

56:52.772 --> 56:54.107
Asshole.

56:57.235 --> 56:59.779
All right.
There's a serial burglar.

57:01.990 --> 57:04.367
Chased him for a year.
A real slickster.

57:04.575 --> 57:07.161
Captain's riding my ass
the whole time.

57:07.620 --> 57:10.331
- Sentencing was today.
- Judge is female.

57:10.623 --> 57:12.250
That's right. Landers.

57:12.458 --> 57:14.877
I know Landers. She's a sharp lady.

57:18.256 --> 57:19.299
No?

57:19.549 --> 57:24.304
Guy gets a hold of some peanut butter,
packs his ass-crack with it.

57:25.221 --> 57:29.434
He's standing before the bench,
waiting to give his statement.

57:29.642 --> 57:34.147
Shoves his hand down his pants,
comes out with extra-chunky Jif.

57:37.442 --> 57:39.402
Bailiffs won't come near him.

57:43.656 --> 57:46.993
Now he looks the judge
right in the eyes...

57:47.201 --> 57:49.454
...and licks his fingers clean.

57:51.622 --> 57:52.999
Holy shit.

57:53.750 --> 57:55.668
So the judge says:

57:55.918 --> 57:58.671
"This man's insane.
He can't go to prison."

57:58.880 --> 58:01.883
- Sends him to Psychiatric.
- She fell for it.

58:02.091 --> 58:03.968
Yeah! She's so fucking smart.

58:04.344 --> 58:08.806
By the time she found out,
the guy's already been transferred.

58:14.395 --> 58:17.106
- Proceedings closed.
- Yeah, closed.

58:17.523 --> 58:20.735
He'll do six months
in the puzzle factory...

58:20.985 --> 58:22.445
...and they'll let him go.

58:22.654 --> 58:24.822
Never, ever do a day in prison.

58:25.239 --> 58:29.160
Give him credit. He worked the system,
deserves his freedom.

58:29.410 --> 58:31.412
Yeah? Think so?

58:31.913 --> 58:33.122
Or not.

58:34.707 --> 58:36.167
I'll tell you what.

58:36.834 --> 58:39.212
I'll find this guy on the street...

58:39.754 --> 58:41.214
...and I'll do him.

58:45.885 --> 58:48.388
Better take his bullets away,
Stan.

58:49.347 --> 58:50.807
Shit!

58:54.519 --> 58:57.605
Heard you had an expensive weekend
in Vegas.

58:58.481 --> 59:02.068
How did you ever screw up so bad?

59:02.276 --> 59:05.321
It's nothing.
I didn't know. It's not my town.

59:05.530 --> 59:08.074
The Russians don't care
if you're a cop.

59:08.700 --> 59:11.744
They'll whack you.
You ought to get on a plane.

59:11.953 --> 59:13.162
Why?

59:13.705 --> 59:15.707
- It's an easy fix.
- How?

59:15.915 --> 59:17.875
I'll just cash in an account.

59:19.085 --> 59:21.921
- Whose?
- One of my old ones. My first one.

59:23.423 --> 59:25.842
The guy's a high-security risk.

59:26.050 --> 59:29.345
If I'm not around,
who will keep him off the radar?

59:29.554 --> 59:33.224
I'm just taxing him, that's all.
Okay?

59:41.566 --> 59:43.109
It's your call.

59:44.277 --> 59:46.195
Don't dick this up.

59:46.446 --> 59:50.700
I do not want to see you
on the front page like the others.

59:51.743 --> 59:53.244
Yeah, I understand.

59:54.620 --> 59:55.621
Who's driving?

59:56.581 --> 59:58.416
Me. Gray Mercedes.

01:00:01.419 --> 01:00:02.587
Get the car.

01:00:05.089 --> 01:00:09.135
Black Monte Carlo there,
back windows shot out.

01:00:23.316 --> 01:00:26.069
It's me.
Listen, we got the green light.

01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:29.739
Fax a copy
of the warrant to the clerk.

01:00:29.947 --> 01:00:34.619
Get it signed by the judge, and I want
you and Paul to bring it to me.

01:00:34.827 --> 01:00:38.289
Tell Jeff to pick up some tools.
Picks and shovels.

01:00:38.498 --> 01:00:42.794
Make sure he signs them out
from maintenance. Copy?

01:00:43.378 --> 01:00:45.797
That's right. Hurry up! Later.

01:00:47.632 --> 01:00:50.176
So how much cash was in that jacket?

01:00:50.802 --> 01:00:52.637
Forty G's.

01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:54.806
What's that for?

01:00:55.348 --> 01:00:57.976
- Really want to know?
- Yes, I do.

01:00:59.143 --> 01:01:03.272
Nothing's free in this world.
Not even arrest warrants.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.609
Shit, man, I didn't want to know.

01:01:17.912 --> 01:01:20.748
Check this out.
Nice suit, Mark.

01:01:20.957 --> 01:01:23.918
- Beautiful suit.
- Yeah, fuck you guys!

01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:43.646
All right. Nice, nice.

01:01:44.105 --> 01:01:45.648
What's up, Alonzo?

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:48.693
- The picks and shovels?
- In the trunk.

01:01:49.027 --> 01:01:50.194
Digging a ditch?

01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:54.991
No, you are.
Nice suit you got on there.

01:01:55.199 --> 01:01:57.035
That's what I said.

01:01:57.952 --> 01:02:00.538
- What up, killer?
- What's up with you?

01:02:00.747 --> 01:02:04.167
- Heard you ran into trouble.
- It's all good.

01:02:04.375 --> 01:02:06.711
Don't worry, everything's fine.

01:02:06.919 --> 01:02:10.590
Shit, if we can get away with it,
I'm with you.

01:02:11.507 --> 01:02:16.095
- Who the fuck is this?
- Jake Hoyt. It's my first day.

01:02:16.304 --> 01:02:18.848
You're a long way from Starbucks.

01:02:21.225 --> 01:02:25.104
- Why the fuck is he here?
- Gotta get his cherry popped.

01:02:25.313 --> 01:02:27.231
Stay the fuck out of my way.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.318
This is for the big dogs. Feel me?

01:02:30.902 --> 01:02:34.614
Here it is, all legit,
signed by the judge, okay?

01:02:34.822 --> 01:02:37.158
Thanks to the Sandman.
Now listen.

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:38.993
Safety is first.

01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:41.788
He gives us shit,
we give him lead.

01:02:41.996 --> 01:02:45.375
Let's do this right
so we can all go home.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:48.378
Time to punch in, ladies.

01:03:36.426 --> 01:03:38.511
Freeze! On the floor!

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.222
- Down!
- What are you clowns doing?

01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:43.808
Hey, new guy, watch him!

01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:47.854
- I'm on him.
- You know what you're doing?

01:03:48.062 --> 01:03:49.314
Drop your gun!

01:03:49.564 --> 01:03:52.275
Five. Four. Three.

01:03:54.068 --> 01:03:55.695
Boom!

01:03:57.864 --> 01:04:00.033
Give me a reason.

01:04:00.491 --> 01:04:03.077
Alonzo's gonna have your ass.

01:04:03.453 --> 01:04:05.204
What's up, Roger?

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:09.834
- What's going down, brother?
- Oh, it's all good, baby.

01:04:12.211 --> 01:04:14.005
It's all good.

01:04:16.841 --> 01:04:19.010
That's for you.

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:24.390
What am I supposed to do with this?
Wipe my ass?

01:04:27.185 --> 01:04:29.228
Bad news, dog.

01:04:29.437 --> 01:04:32.565
Gimme some of that $300-a-glass shit.

01:04:32.774 --> 01:04:34.942
Please.

01:04:35.777 --> 01:04:38.446
Had lunch with the wise men.

01:04:38.655 --> 01:04:40.740
You gotta render unto Caesar.

01:04:40.948 --> 01:04:44.369
- Those vampires want my pension.
- No, no.

01:04:49.791 --> 01:04:51.125
Just a tax.

01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:55.546
They got their boats and mistresses,
house payments.

01:04:55.755 --> 01:04:59.592
Nothing I can do.
I'm just a lowly civil servant.

01:04:59.884 --> 01:05:02.011
You're their bitch.

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:04.973
- What about me?
- I got your back.

01:05:05.223 --> 01:05:09.227
Don't worry, we won't
take anything you'll miss.

01:05:11.062 --> 01:05:13.314
I'm sorry. Orders, dog.

01:05:13.523 --> 01:05:14.899
No you ain't, cop.

01:05:17.068 --> 01:05:18.945
In the kitchen, fellas.

01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:21.656
Give me the bitch.

01:05:22.949 --> 01:05:25.368
You guys hold him down.

01:05:26.244 --> 01:05:28.579
- Who'll pay for my floor?
- The city.

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:39.215
Right here.

01:06:17.587 --> 01:06:20.089
That's what I'm talking about.

01:06:28.306 --> 01:06:29.974
What's in here? Coke?

01:06:30.183 --> 01:06:31.684
You'll see.

01:06:31.893 --> 01:06:35.730
Grab that hammer
and knock this lock off.

01:06:38.149 --> 01:06:40.485
One, two...

01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:51.120
That's $250,000 you're holding.

01:06:51.329 --> 01:06:53.790
Over four million in here.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.000
A $3 million bust on day one.

01:06:56.209 --> 01:06:59.462
- You said four.
- Minus tax, brother!

01:06:59.671 --> 01:07:02.173
Nothing's free in this world.

01:07:02.465 --> 01:07:06.844
Buy your wife a car.
Put the kids through college.

01:07:07.053 --> 01:07:10.181
The only checks I cash say "L.A.P.D."

01:07:11.849 --> 01:07:14.602
Somebody didn't sleep
through Ethics.

01:07:15.895 --> 01:07:18.356
You don't want a piece of this?

01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.694
No, right?

01:07:23.653 --> 01:07:25.113
Not like this.

01:07:25.363 --> 01:07:27.365
No.

01:07:28.116 --> 01:07:30.243
No?

01:07:33.871 --> 01:07:38.543
First time, you're not comfortable.
I'll hold it for you.

01:07:38.793 --> 01:07:41.671
- What about you?
- Oh, I'm comfortable.

01:07:42.588 --> 01:07:45.341
- How about you?
- I'm very comfortable.

01:07:45.675 --> 01:07:47.719
Let's wrap this up.

01:07:50.805 --> 01:07:53.850
Don't touch a thing! Evidence.

01:07:58.438 --> 01:08:01.482
Alonzo, what are
those pricks thinking?

01:08:01.733 --> 01:08:06.195
That I'm gonna stand still and
let them horsefuck me?

01:08:06.446 --> 01:08:09.615
Could put you out of your misery.

01:08:11.159 --> 01:08:12.452
Hey, Jake, here.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.331
Sit down.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.502
Here's a secret:

01:08:22.754 --> 01:08:24.881
When you kill someone on duty...

01:08:25.089 --> 01:08:28.968
...they have to be your slave
in the afterlife.

01:08:32.805 --> 01:08:34.932
There you go.

01:08:35.265 --> 01:08:36.934
Start an entourage.

01:08:40.604 --> 01:08:41.939
- Shoot him?
- Yeah.

01:08:42.148 --> 01:08:44.817
Come on, kid. Do me a favor.

01:08:45.026 --> 01:08:46.819
Come on.

01:08:47.153 --> 01:08:49.238
Do yourself a favor. Hit him.

01:08:49.447 --> 01:08:50.782
Are you serious?

01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:53.868
Hey, close the blinds.

01:09:04.127 --> 01:09:06.673
- All right, I'll shoot him.
- Go.

01:09:11.135 --> 01:09:12.303
- Pow!
- Boom!

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:17.015
Shoot him.

01:09:17.392 --> 01:09:18.893
No, man.

01:09:20.728 --> 01:09:23.523
Kids these days.
Not gonna do it?

01:09:23.731 --> 01:09:26.359
All right, give it to me.

01:09:26.693 --> 01:09:27.777
Rookies!

01:09:27.986 --> 01:09:30.988
You want shit done,
you gotta do it yourself.

01:09:32.532 --> 01:09:33.533
Holy shit!

01:09:35.283 --> 01:09:37.286
Come on, breathe.

01:09:37.495 --> 01:09:39.663
Breathe, there you go.

01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:44.042
Just let it go.

01:09:45.211 --> 01:09:46.837
Breathe, dog!

01:09:55.847 --> 01:09:56.848
He's finished.

01:09:58.099 --> 01:10:00.643
- Where's the stinger?
- Right here.

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:05.481
All right, Jeff.

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.483
You took fire coming in.

01:10:07.692 --> 01:10:10.194
I need some time off, but...

01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:14.782
- Watch the shades.
- All right.

01:10:18.328 --> 01:10:19.829
- Ready?
- Kiss me.

01:10:20.038 --> 01:10:21.623
One...

01:10:24.292 --> 01:10:25.501
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:25.752 --> 01:10:28.171
I gotta give you one more, though.

01:10:28.379 --> 01:10:29.422
Do it.

01:10:30.214 --> 01:10:32.050
Fuck!

01:10:32.467 --> 01:10:35.470
It's not what you know,
it's what you prove.

01:10:35.678 --> 01:10:39.140
Here it is.
Mark and Paul kick the door.

01:10:39.349 --> 01:10:42.310
Jeff's in first.
Roger fires twice.

01:10:46.648 --> 01:10:48.608
What, one go through?

01:10:48.816 --> 01:10:52.028
- You shot him!
- You fucking shot me, man!

01:10:52.236 --> 01:10:54.447
- Don't worry.
- Call an ambulance!

01:10:55.281 --> 01:10:57.492
Go to jail, or go home?

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.911
All right, here's the scenario.

01:11:00.161 --> 01:11:03.539
Mark and Paul kick the door.
Jeff runs in.

01:11:03.748 --> 01:11:06.000
Roger opens fire, hits Jeff.

01:11:06.209 --> 01:11:10.880
Hoyt is in second,
drops Roger with the shotgun.

01:11:11.089 --> 01:11:13.257
- Who shot Roger?
- New guy.

01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:14.926
- New guy.
- You two?

01:11:15.134 --> 01:11:18.513
- Hoyt.
- Fuck Hoyt. Ambulance time!

01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:21.140
Done. Paul, call them up.

01:11:21.349 --> 01:11:24.143
11-49. 998. Shots fired.

01:11:24.352 --> 01:11:26.980
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

01:11:27.230 --> 01:11:29.607
5951 Baxter Street.

01:11:30.066 --> 01:11:34.696
Congratulations. You're gonna get
a medal of valor for this.

01:11:34.904 --> 01:11:37.448
- I didn't shoot him.
- Four cops saw it.

01:11:37.657 --> 01:11:39.993
But I didn't. You did.

01:11:42.829 --> 01:11:48.418
"An L.A.P.D. Narcotics officer
was killed today...

01:11:48.626 --> 01:11:51.254
...serving a warrant
in Echo Park."

01:11:51.462 --> 01:11:52.964
Give me the bitch.

01:11:56.342 --> 01:12:00.680
"A spokesperson said
the officer is survived...

01:12:02.098 --> 01:12:03.683
...by a wife and child."

01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:06.519
There's more. You get the picture?

01:12:06.769 --> 01:12:08.313
Yeah, I get it.

01:12:09.397 --> 01:12:12.984
That's the second time
you pointed a gun at me!

01:12:13.192 --> 01:12:15.653
Goddamn, boy! That's it, Jake!

01:12:15.945 --> 01:12:18.489
Y'all see this?
That's it!

01:12:18.698 --> 01:12:22.118
- I'll put a bullet in that melon.
- Wait, wait.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:24.954
I'm gonna be cool. Drop the gun!

01:12:25.163 --> 01:12:27.290
Shoot me.
He's coming with me.

01:12:27.498 --> 01:12:29.334
- I'll shoot!
- He's a fed.

01:12:29.542 --> 01:12:34.047
No, he ain't. He's just a kid
that got the drop on y'all.

01:12:34.255 --> 01:12:38.843
Let's take a deep breath
and just diffuse this. Jake?

01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:41.804
I didn't sign up for this!

01:12:42.013 --> 01:12:45.725
I know you're angry.
Everybody, put the guns down.

01:12:45.933 --> 01:12:48.519
- Hell, no.
- Choirboy first.

01:12:48.728 --> 01:12:51.064
Listen! That's an order!

01:12:51.272 --> 01:12:53.191
Put them down!

01:13:00.907 --> 01:13:03.368
Use your ears, Jake.

01:13:03.576 --> 01:13:06.537
Sometimes we take this shit
all the way.

01:13:06.746 --> 01:13:09.248
It's the nature of the business.

01:13:09.457 --> 01:13:14.379
You'll never have to pull
the trigger again, all right?

01:13:14.796 --> 01:13:17.799
- Mark, where are you transferring?
- S.I.S.

01:13:18.383 --> 01:13:19.550
Detective.

01:13:19.759 --> 01:13:23.805
You give me 18 months,
I give you a career.

01:13:24.055 --> 01:13:26.891
We make the big seizures, Jake.

01:13:27.141 --> 01:13:31.270
But if you're in my unit,
you gotta be in it all the way.

01:13:31.479 --> 01:13:34.607
I thought you were man enough
to handle this shit.

01:13:34.816 --> 01:13:38.695
Five decorated officers say
that you shot Roger.

01:13:38.903 --> 01:13:42.740
They will check your blood
for intoxicants.

01:13:42.949 --> 01:13:44.909
What are they gonna find?

01:13:45.702 --> 01:13:48.871
You've been smoking PCP all day.

01:13:49.122 --> 01:13:52.959
- You've been planning this all day.
- All week, son.

01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:56.754
You talk, your blood gets to the lab.

01:13:56.963 --> 01:14:00.883
You wanna take a walk?
You won't make it out of here.

01:14:01.092 --> 01:14:03.803
If you're cool, you're a hero.

01:14:04.012 --> 01:14:06.014
You're above suspicion.

01:14:06.222 --> 01:14:08.558
Alonzo, there's two shots left.

01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:12.603
We need to kill him now
and say Roger got him.

01:14:14.731 --> 01:14:17.025
No, we ain't killing nobody.

01:14:17.275 --> 01:14:20.528
This is a good man. I can feel it.

01:14:20.737 --> 01:14:24.699
Just had a little freak-out,
that's all.

01:14:24.907 --> 01:14:26.826
I say he's cool.

01:14:27.035 --> 01:14:29.829
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

01:14:30.038 --> 01:14:32.248
You do have a decision to make.

01:14:32.457 --> 01:14:36.794
Because this place is gonna
be overrun with blue suits.

01:14:37.003 --> 01:14:41.799
So why don't you please
go outside, clear your head.

01:14:43.426 --> 01:14:45.678
Or shoot me.

01:14:58.650 --> 01:14:59.651
Hey, Paul?

01:15:04.989 --> 01:15:08.242
You're dead, motherfucker!
You hear me?! Dead!

01:16:25.069 --> 01:16:28.072
Well, lay off the device.

01:16:28.406 --> 01:16:29.782
All right.

01:16:31.534 --> 01:16:33.953
Make sure that tub is clean.

01:16:34.787 --> 01:16:36.289
All right?

01:16:39.125 --> 01:16:41.544
All right, later.

01:16:45.757 --> 01:16:47.508
You all right?

01:16:53.431 --> 01:16:56.934
It behooves you not
to dick around on this one.

01:16:57.810 --> 01:17:00.521
Justifiable homicide
in the line of duty.

01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:03.775
- Now, what happened...
- What happened was murder.

01:17:04.025 --> 01:17:06.611
And armed robbery.

01:17:06.861 --> 01:17:09.113
We had badges, so it's different?

01:17:09.322 --> 01:17:12.158
Son, open your eyes! Can't you see?

01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:17.080
That man was your friend,
and you killed him like a fly.

01:17:17.288 --> 01:17:19.082
My friend? Tell me why?

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:22.377
Because he knows my first name?

01:17:22.585 --> 01:17:25.421
This is the game.
I played his ass.

01:17:25.630 --> 01:17:27.799
That's our job.

01:17:28.049 --> 01:17:32.929
Roger sold dope to kids.
The world's better off without him.

01:17:33.972 --> 01:17:38.977
This man was the biggest
major violator in Los Angeles.

01:17:39.185 --> 01:17:43.648
I watched that cocksucker for years
and now I got him.

01:17:43.856 --> 01:17:45.817
This is chess, not checkers!

01:17:53.866 --> 01:17:57.704
What'd you think?
We'd roll up in a black and white?

01:17:57.912 --> 01:17:59.956
Slap the cuffs on him?

01:18:00.164 --> 01:18:02.166
He's a high roller, dog.

01:18:06.087 --> 01:18:08.172
- Take the money.
- I'm not taking it.

01:18:08.381 --> 01:18:09.841
- Just take it.
- No!

01:18:10.049 --> 01:18:14.178
Look, I don't give a fuck, but
the boys'll feel better.

01:18:14.387 --> 01:18:16.639
Fuck their feelings!

01:18:16.848 --> 01:18:18.474
Jake, we're a team.

01:18:18.683 --> 01:18:20.643
A team?

01:18:20.852 --> 01:18:23.479
You guys are fucking insane.

01:18:23.688 --> 01:18:27.400
I'll go back to the Valley,
I'll cut parking tickets.

01:18:31.779 --> 01:18:34.324
- It can't be like this.
- It is.

01:18:34.532 --> 01:18:36.284
I'm sorry, but it is.

01:18:36.492 --> 01:18:38.870
It's ugly, but it's necessary.

01:18:39.078 --> 01:18:44.208
I became a cop to put away
dealers and criminals, not to be one.

01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:45.960
You sound just like me.

01:18:46.336 --> 01:18:49.255
I know what you're
going through and feeling.

01:18:49.464 --> 01:18:50.965
- You're scared.
- I'm not.

01:18:51.174 --> 01:18:55.762
Yes, you are. Everyone goes
through that the first time. I did.

01:18:56.763 --> 01:19:01.184
The sooner you match
what's in your head...

01:19:01.392 --> 01:19:04.228
...with what's in the real world...

01:19:04.437 --> 01:19:06.272
...the better you'll feel.

01:19:06.481 --> 01:19:08.191
In this business...

01:19:08.399 --> 01:19:12.028
...you gotta have dirt on you
to be trusted.

01:19:12.945 --> 01:19:17.575
When all this is behind you, a whole
other world will open up for you.

01:19:19.911 --> 01:19:22.288
I walk a higher path, son.

01:19:22.497 --> 01:19:25.375
I have the keys to all the doors.

01:19:27.001 --> 01:19:28.419
What do you mean?

01:19:29.545 --> 01:19:32.882
My guys aren't leaders, they're clowns.
You're a leader.

01:19:33.132 --> 01:19:34.884
You want my job?
You got it.

01:19:35.134 --> 01:19:38.846
You want to lock up poisoners?
This is the place to do it.

01:19:40.765 --> 01:19:43.059
But you gotta take your time.

01:19:43.267 --> 01:19:46.229
You'll make detective,
you'll grow wise.

01:19:46.437 --> 01:19:49.524
And then you can change things.

01:19:49.941 --> 01:19:52.610
But it's gotta be from the inside.

01:19:55.989 --> 01:20:00.618
Let's go downtown to the station.
Talk to my guy, Stan.

01:20:01.286 --> 01:20:04.747
He'll go through what you
gotta say to the D.A.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.258
What are we doing now?

01:20:57.508 --> 01:21:01.929
I told an informant I'd take care
of his family for him.

01:21:05.183 --> 01:21:07.810
Bring them food, stuff like that.

01:21:08.019 --> 01:21:11.481
Gotta help out the family.

01:21:12.023 --> 01:21:15.401
Believe it or not,
I do try to do some good.

01:21:19.197 --> 01:21:21.366
You know where you're at, dog?

01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:29.958
The fuck you looking at?

01:22:05.326 --> 01:22:08.663
Hey, we got some things
for the family.

01:22:21.592 --> 01:22:23.553
Kitchen's this way.

01:22:30.977 --> 01:22:32.729
Put it on the counter.

01:22:32.937 --> 01:22:36.232
- Where's the head?
- Right through.

01:22:43.781 --> 01:22:47.910
I'm gonna go to the head.
Two seconds, we're gone.

01:22:48.494 --> 01:22:51.164
Hey, let me get the CD player.

01:22:52.665 --> 01:22:54.459
No, the CD player's mine.

01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:56.127
Dreamer! Come here!

01:22:58.046 --> 01:23:00.381
Count that shit, all right?

01:23:01.382 --> 01:23:03.801
Thanks a lot, I was busy.

01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:07.055
Learn how to count, fucking math whiz.

01:23:09.807 --> 01:23:11.559
- You looked!
- I didn't.

01:23:11.768 --> 01:23:14.312
You calling me a cheater, <i>ése</i> ?

01:23:14.562 --> 01:23:16.189
Deal again, Sniper.

01:23:19.359 --> 01:23:21.611
You play cards, cop?

01:23:21.819 --> 01:23:23.321
No, not really.

01:23:23.529 --> 01:23:24.781
Want a beer?

01:23:24.989 --> 01:23:26.324
Have a cold one.

01:23:26.991 --> 01:23:28.952
No, thanks, I'm good.

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.956
Come on, sit down.
Play a card game with us.

01:23:33.164 --> 01:23:35.833
Don't be rude, <i>ése.</i> You're a guest.

01:23:36.042 --> 01:23:38.002
Why don't you play one hand?

01:23:38.795 --> 01:23:41.297
Don't worry, we ain't betting money.

01:23:41.506 --> 01:23:43.424
We gotta roll in a second.

01:23:43.633 --> 01:23:45.677
Alonzo's taking a shit.

01:23:48.972 --> 01:23:51.516
All right, I'll play one hand.

01:23:52.433 --> 01:23:54.352
Is this five-card draw?

01:23:54.936 --> 01:23:57.730
Yeah, jokers are wild.

01:23:58.022 --> 01:24:00.483
Why don't you tell us something?

01:24:00.692 --> 01:24:03.403
How long you been a pig?

01:24:03.778 --> 01:24:05.989
My bad. My bad.

01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:09.117
I meant a police officer.

01:24:09.409 --> 01:24:11.536
I've been a pig for 19 months.

01:24:11.744 --> 01:24:13.955
Is that right? You like it?

01:24:14.163 --> 01:24:17.375
I should've been a fireman.
One more.

01:24:20.461 --> 01:24:23.256
- What you got, dog?
- Three of a kind.

01:24:23.464 --> 01:24:25.883
I didn't get shit.

01:24:26.134 --> 01:24:28.136
Boo-ya, baby!

01:24:28.845 --> 01:24:31.889
Two pair!

01:24:34.642 --> 01:24:35.685
What the fuck?

01:24:36.894 --> 01:24:38.187
He won.

01:24:39.022 --> 01:24:41.524
I got two pair!

01:24:42.150 --> 01:24:46.279
Three of a kind beats two pair,
you fucking dumb truck.

01:24:48.364 --> 01:24:51.743
You're fucking stupid.
Take your medication.

01:24:51.993 --> 01:24:54.412
Seriously. I know I'm number one.

01:24:54.662 --> 01:24:59.125
See why we don't play for money?
Because of this <i>vato.</i>

01:24:59.834 --> 01:25:01.961
- Show me your <i>cohete.</i>
- What?

01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:05.840
Your gun, homes.
Underneath your shirt.

01:25:06.257 --> 01:25:08.426
What is it, .380 stainless?

01:25:08.635 --> 01:25:10.386
- 9mm Beretta.
- Like that?

01:25:13.598 --> 01:25:15.350
- Just like it.
- Yeah?

01:25:15.933 --> 01:25:17.477
Here's the problem.

01:25:18.728 --> 01:25:21.939
I seen this one.
I want to see yours.

01:25:23.483 --> 01:25:26.944
Come on, <i>ése,</i>
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.

01:25:29.822 --> 01:25:32.200
Let me check it out.

01:25:42.585 --> 01:25:44.712
Learn that in the Academy?

01:25:44.921 --> 01:25:47.715
Neat trick.
This is nice.

01:25:47.924 --> 01:25:51.970
Nice.
You could fuck a <i>vato</i> up with this.

01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:57.308
What you do is, you aim like that.

01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:02.814
I'm just playing.

01:26:03.064 --> 01:26:05.817
Yeah, I gotta go.
Alonzo!

01:26:06.818 --> 01:26:08.903
Kick back and party.

01:26:09.112 --> 01:26:11.698
Ain't nothing out there for you.

01:26:11.906 --> 01:26:14.117
What are you talking about?

01:26:17.328 --> 01:26:18.705
Hey, white boy.

01:26:19.289 --> 01:26:23.459
If you ask me homes,
that's just, of course, if you ask...

01:26:23.668 --> 01:26:25.712
...Alonzo played you, <i>ése.</i>

01:26:26.212 --> 01:26:28.506
Big time.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.301
Wait, where you going?

01:26:32.385 --> 01:26:35.263
It's your deal.

01:26:45.023 --> 01:26:47.275
It's all there.

01:26:47.650 --> 01:26:50.653
- Sure?
- You can count it yourself.

01:26:56.075 --> 01:26:58.828
Alonzo pulled off a miracle.

01:26:59.412 --> 01:27:01.831
Times are tight.
Scared up a lot of cash.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.334
Who'd he jack, homes?

01:27:04.792 --> 01:27:06.127
I don't know.

01:27:09.964 --> 01:27:12.342
He jacked Roger.

01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:14.093
Blasted that fool.

01:27:14.302 --> 01:27:18.222
Alonzo's a low-down, ruthless <i>vato.</i>

01:27:18.431 --> 01:27:20.308
But I like that.

01:27:22.268 --> 01:27:24.979
That's why I never shake his hand.

01:27:25.271 --> 01:27:27.899
He don't respect <i>nada.</i>

01:27:28.107 --> 01:27:30.568
Know what the money's for?

01:27:30.777 --> 01:27:33.863
Alonzo, he's a hothead.

01:27:34.072 --> 01:27:37.533
Last week in Vegas, some Russian
starts talking shit.

01:27:37.742 --> 01:27:40.703
Alonzo, he just snapped.

01:27:40.912 --> 01:27:43.247
Beat his ass to death.

01:27:43.456 --> 01:27:47.085
Turns out, that Russian,
he's a somebody.

01:27:47.335 --> 01:27:52.256
Now, Alonzo's into the Russians
for a million.

01:27:52.632 --> 01:27:54.634
How do you know that?

01:27:58.596 --> 01:28:01.224
Alonzo has until tonight to pay up.

01:28:01.432 --> 01:28:03.977
But he's still on their list.

01:28:04.352 --> 01:28:07.188
Nobody thought he could
get the cash.

01:28:08.272 --> 01:28:11.776
Good thing he did.
They're looking for him.

01:28:12.694 --> 01:28:18.449
If he don't turn up downtown with
the cash by midnight...

01:28:18.658 --> 01:28:20.368
Your <i>vato...</i>

01:28:20.576 --> 01:28:21.953
...he's dead.

01:28:22.829 --> 01:28:23.955
Hey, pig.

01:28:24.163 --> 01:28:26.666
Ever had your shit pushed in?

01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:28.835
Simple question.

01:28:29.043 --> 01:28:30.336
- No?
- No.

01:28:30.712 --> 01:28:33.298
- Had my shit pushed in.
- Yeah, man.

01:28:33.506 --> 01:28:37.427
I had my shit pushed in, bro!

01:28:37.635 --> 01:28:39.262
Big time!

01:28:41.014 --> 01:28:42.640
Smiley?

01:28:42.849 --> 01:28:46.811
Sure, I always get love
from the homeys.

01:28:57.196 --> 01:28:59.032
You guys fucked him up!

01:28:59.282 --> 01:29:00.617
Go next door.

01:29:00.825 --> 01:29:03.119
Get the fuck out of here!

01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:07.665
You fucked up.

01:29:07.957 --> 01:29:09.834
You're under arrest!

01:29:10.043 --> 01:29:14.672
For being a cop, dogging me
in the mouth in my own pad.

01:29:15.256 --> 01:29:19.093
You got the right
to be bitch-slapped!

01:29:22.513 --> 01:29:23.973
Drag him to the tub.

01:29:24.182 --> 01:29:25.850
Punk motherfucker!

01:29:28.311 --> 01:29:30.188
Raid his ass!

01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:53.836
Do it!

01:29:54.045 --> 01:29:55.797
It's gonna be loud.

01:30:00.051 --> 01:30:01.886
Let me get his money.

01:30:02.595 --> 01:30:04.305
- Wait.
- Hurry up.

01:30:11.437 --> 01:30:13.398
Smiley, check it out.

01:30:13.606 --> 01:30:16.067
Is that your little cousin?

01:30:23.408 --> 01:30:25.868
- What's this?
- I found it!

01:30:26.077 --> 01:30:27.704
- Who had it?
- I found it!

01:30:28.496 --> 01:30:29.539
Where?

01:30:29.747 --> 01:30:33.584
I found it in MacArthur Park!
MacArthur Park!

01:30:38.589 --> 01:30:40.800
Wait up, I can't even see.

01:30:41.009 --> 01:30:42.427
Shut the fuck up!

01:30:42.635 --> 01:30:44.762
Get in your last prayer.

01:30:44.971 --> 01:30:46.597
Listen to me, man.

01:30:46.806 --> 01:30:48.433
She was being raped.

01:30:48.641 --> 01:30:51.644
Two crackheads were attacking her...

01:30:51.853 --> 01:30:54.814
...and I stopped them!
I swear to God!

01:30:55.064 --> 01:30:58.901
- You're lying to me!
- I am not lying!

01:30:59.277 --> 01:31:01.529
She was being raped!

01:31:01.738 --> 01:31:03.072
I stopped them!

01:31:03.323 --> 01:31:04.907
Please! I got a kid.

01:31:05.116 --> 01:31:07.994
- Shut up, fag!
- Blast his ass.

01:31:08.536 --> 01:31:11.873
I have a little girl!

01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:13.625
Do it!

01:31:15.251 --> 01:31:19.797
I'm gonna get to the bottom of your
bullshit. She's my cousin, homes.

01:31:20.006 --> 01:31:21.966
Ain't right involving her.

01:31:22.216 --> 01:31:23.301
You fucked up.

01:31:27.764 --> 01:31:29.974
If you're lying to me...

01:31:30.183 --> 01:31:31.809
...I blow your balls off.

01:31:32.018 --> 01:31:33.645
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hey, Letty.

01:31:33.853 --> 01:31:35.813
- What's up?
<i>- Hey, Smiley.</i>

01:31:36.022 --> 01:31:38.816
Just doing homework. You want Tony?

01:31:39.025 --> 01:31:40.401
No, I want you.

01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:43.613
- You go to school today?
- Yeah.

01:31:44.030 --> 01:31:46.157
- You didn't ditch?
<i>- Nope.</i>

01:31:46.366 --> 01:31:48.993
I went to every class. Why?

01:31:49.243 --> 01:31:51.120
I heard different.

01:31:53.706 --> 01:31:55.625
Cops talk to you today?

01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:01.506
- No, no.
<i>- All right, Letty...</i>

01:32:01.756 --> 01:32:03.341
...don't bullshit me.

01:32:07.762 --> 01:32:10.348
I got jumped by two crackheads.

01:32:10.556 --> 01:32:14.769
- You got jumped?
<i>- I think they wanted to rape me.</i>

01:32:14.978 --> 01:32:17.355
<i>But nothing happened, okay?</i>

01:32:17.563 --> 01:32:19.607
Because this cop came.

01:32:19.816 --> 01:32:22.026
<i>They almost killed him...</i>

01:32:22.235 --> 01:32:24.320
<i>... but he kicked their ass.</i>

01:32:24.529 --> 01:32:25.905
Describe him.

01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:30.660
He was a white boy.
He looked real young.

01:32:31.286 --> 01:32:33.913
- You're okay?
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

01:32:34.163 --> 01:32:35.498
- Hey, Letty.
- Yeah?

01:32:35.707 --> 01:32:37.000
We're not done.

01:32:37.375 --> 01:32:38.418
Okay.

01:32:39.752 --> 01:32:40.920
What's up?

01:32:41.504 --> 01:32:42.880
You gonna blast him?

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.094
<i>Vato</i> was telling the truth.

01:32:48.303 --> 01:32:50.054
Life's a trip, <i>qué no</i> ?

01:32:50.388 --> 01:32:52.348
This is some trippy shit.

01:33:06.696 --> 01:33:09.532
That's for getting my cousin's back.

01:33:11.242 --> 01:33:14.412
Cover your head.
You'll mess up my floor.

01:33:15.288 --> 01:33:18.249
You know this was just
business, right?

01:33:21.836 --> 01:33:23.630
Right?

01:33:25.298 --> 01:33:27.300
Right.

01:34:41.082 --> 01:34:44.961
What you doing here?
You know you don't belong here.

01:34:49.007 --> 01:34:51.759
- What's up?
- Must be lost, motherfucker!

01:34:53.094 --> 01:34:56.180
Gonna need more than that
up in here, boy!

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:11.321
You got business here, rookie?

01:35:11.738 --> 01:35:13.865
I'm here for Alonzo.

01:36:23.768 --> 01:36:26.604
Hey. Is your dad home?

01:36:26.813 --> 01:36:29.190
- In the bedroom.
- He's in the bedroom?

01:36:29.399 --> 01:36:32.068
All right, you wanna open up the door?

01:36:32.277 --> 01:36:35.947
Okay. Thanks. You watching TV?

01:36:37.198 --> 01:36:38.866
Yeah, anything good on?

01:36:47.458 --> 01:36:50.878
- Do you want me to call my mom?
- No, I don't.

01:36:52.005 --> 01:36:54.007
I'll tell you what I want.

01:36:54.632 --> 01:36:56.426
Find a good hiding spot.

01:36:56.634 --> 01:36:59.470
Do you have a favorite place to hide?

01:37:00.388 --> 01:37:03.933
- The closet.
- In the closet? That's perfect.

01:37:04.475 --> 01:37:08.438
Okay, open up the closet.
All right. Good, good.

01:37:08.646 --> 01:37:10.857
Can you sit down in there?

01:37:11.274 --> 01:37:15.320
All right. Now stay in here
and be very quiet.

01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:18.364
I'll be right back. All right?

01:37:45.892 --> 01:37:47.685
It's all good, baby.

01:37:55.318 --> 01:37:56.861
You, against the wall.

01:37:57.070 --> 01:38:00.406
Move real slow.
Put the money in that bag...

01:38:00.615 --> 01:38:04.702
...take your weapons and place them
inside that pillowcase.

01:38:06.663 --> 01:38:10.583
Congratulations, son. You made it.

01:38:10.833 --> 01:38:13.086
You passed the test. You're a narc.

01:38:13.294 --> 01:38:16.798
Put the gun down before you give
her a heart attack.

01:38:17.006 --> 01:38:19.425
I said put the money in that bag.

01:38:19.634 --> 01:38:22.762
Place your weapons
inside that pillowcase.

01:38:22.971 --> 01:38:26.015
Fuck your appointment
with the Russians.

01:38:26.224 --> 01:38:28.351
Oh, okay.

01:38:29.352 --> 01:38:31.771
Okay. Hand me the pillowcase, baby.

01:38:32.397 --> 01:38:34.565
Baby! Hand me the pillowcase.

01:38:35.233 --> 01:38:36.734
You're gonna book me?

01:38:37.151 --> 01:38:38.695
You smoked the dust.

01:38:38.903 --> 01:38:42.824
You ran out, and you're the one
that shot Roger.

01:38:44.367 --> 01:38:47.412
- Here you go.
- And the one on your ankle?

01:38:47.954 --> 01:38:50.665
Want the one in my back pocket too?

01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:56.879
One problem: You got no witnesses.

01:38:57.088 --> 01:39:00.883
Who are your witnesses, huh?
Roger? Smiley?

01:39:01.092 --> 01:39:02.802
You think they'll help you?

01:39:03.428 --> 01:39:08.099
It's not what you know.
It's what you can prove.

01:39:11.811 --> 01:39:14.689
What can you prove, huh? Nothing.

01:39:14.897 --> 01:39:17.025
- Where's your evidence?
- There.

01:39:20.695 --> 01:39:21.821
Oh, shit!

01:39:26.993 --> 01:39:28.953
It's on now, Jake.

01:39:30.246 --> 01:39:31.664
Don't move.

01:39:34.334 --> 01:39:35.960
Where you at, Jake?

01:39:36.919 --> 01:39:38.004
Come on out, dog!

01:39:51.434 --> 01:39:54.646
- Ah! I see you.
- Shit!

01:40:00.610 --> 01:40:03.988
I'm surgical with this bitch.
How you want it?

01:40:04.197 --> 01:40:08.493
That fool in the wheelchair?
How you think he got there?

01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:14.248
- Mommy.
- Alonzito!

01:40:17.126 --> 01:40:18.461
You see what I see?

01:40:19.379 --> 01:40:23.591
Officer Hoyt, job number one:
Preserve life.

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:26.511
There's my son. Don't hurt him.

01:40:26.719 --> 01:40:28.930
We're walking out together.

01:40:47.699 --> 01:40:50.576
Alonzito! Alonzito!

01:40:55.498 --> 01:40:57.750
- You all right?
- I want my mommy.

01:40:57.959 --> 01:40:59.502
I know, I know, I know.

01:40:59.711 --> 01:41:02.213
Just sit tight, all right?

01:41:02.422 --> 01:41:06.134
It's gonna be all right. I know.

01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:09.178
Shut the fuck up!

01:41:11.931 --> 01:41:15.184
All right, let me see your hands!
Where is he?

01:41:15.935 --> 01:41:17.603
- The window.
- Come on!

01:41:17.812 --> 01:41:20.106
- Get your kid, stay down.
- Alonzito!

01:46:22.408 --> 01:46:24.369
Hey, man, you tripping?

01:46:24.702 --> 01:46:27.789
It's no fun when the rabbit
has the gun, is it?

01:46:29.499 --> 01:46:31.042
My nigga.

01:46:34.045 --> 01:46:38.216
Hey, first Damu puts one
in his head...

01:46:39.842 --> 01:46:41.928
...I'll make you a rich man!

01:46:42.929 --> 01:46:44.389
Come on now.

01:46:44.597 --> 01:46:45.807
Who wanna get paid?

01:46:47.684 --> 01:46:49.227
Who wanna get paid?

01:46:53.147 --> 01:46:54.857
They're not like you.

01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:58.152
You know what I learned today?

01:46:58.861 --> 01:47:03.074
- I'm not like you.
- That's good. I'm glad to hear that.

01:47:04.450 --> 01:47:08.288
Good. So, what now? Huh?

01:47:09.414 --> 01:47:11.291
What you gonna do, shoot me?

01:47:11.499 --> 01:47:14.335
You gonna bust your cherry
killing a cop?

01:47:20.174 --> 01:47:21.759
There it is, Jake.

01:47:23.594 --> 01:47:24.637
Hit me.

01:47:26.014 --> 01:47:30.310
You never killed nobody before.
It ain't like stepping on ants.

01:47:30.852 --> 01:47:32.478
Takes a man to kill.

01:47:34.230 --> 01:47:36.274
Are you man enough to kill?

01:47:38.651 --> 01:47:39.902
Hit me right there.

01:47:44.365 --> 01:47:48.328
Get me, Jake. Get me.
Hit me. Hit me.

01:47:48.536 --> 01:47:53.249
You can't do it.
Somebody drop this fool for me.

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:14.228
You got us twisted.
You got to put your own work in.

01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:19.233
- All right. It's like that, Bone?
- It's like that.

01:48:23.029 --> 01:48:26.616
Player to player, pimp to pimp.

01:48:26.824 --> 01:48:29.702
- I don't believe you'd shoot me.
- Don't do it.

01:48:30.995 --> 01:48:34.040
- Don't.
- I don't believe you got it in you.

01:48:44.926 --> 01:48:47.887
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

01:48:48.137 --> 01:48:50.098
You ain't gonna do a thing.

01:48:50.306 --> 01:48:53.601
You ain't gonna shoot no cop
in the back.

01:48:54.519 --> 01:48:56.938
- Don't do it.
- You know what you'd get?

01:48:57.188 --> 01:49:00.566
The gas chamber.
You know what it smells like?

01:49:00.775 --> 01:49:05.071
Pine oil. That's where you headed,
to pine oil heaven.

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.907
I'm gonna get that gun and that money.

01:49:08.116 --> 01:49:11.619
I don't think you got it in you.
I'm gonna go get it.

01:49:13.204 --> 01:49:17.166
Shit! Ah, you motherfucker!

01:49:17.625 --> 01:49:19.585
The next one will kill you.

01:49:19.794 --> 01:49:23.047
Son of a bitch!
You shot me in the ass!

01:49:23.256 --> 01:49:24.799
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

01:49:25.008 --> 01:49:26.467
Okay, okay.

01:49:26.718 --> 01:49:30.430
All right. Come on, I need
the money. Give me the money.

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:34.350
- Give me that money!
- It's not gonna happen.

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:37.812
You gonna take my own money from me?

01:49:38.062 --> 01:49:41.733
That's my evidence.
You wanna go to jail or go home?

01:49:44.444 --> 01:49:46.112
I wanna go home, Jake.

01:49:47.989 --> 01:49:50.950
Give me the money,
and let me go home.

01:49:51.159 --> 01:49:54.245
- You wanna go home?
- Yeah, let me go home, Jake.

01:49:54.454 --> 01:49:56.706
Give me the money,
and let me go.

01:49:58.333 --> 01:50:01.336
Give me the money,
and let me go home, Jake.

01:50:01.544 --> 01:50:03.046
That's right, come on.

01:50:06.466 --> 01:50:08.301
You don't deserve this.

01:50:09.719 --> 01:50:11.054
Okay, motherfucker.

01:50:16.851 --> 01:50:18.770
Jake, go and bounce, homey.

01:50:18.978 --> 01:50:22.023
Get up out of here. We got your back.

01:50:23.066 --> 01:50:24.192
What?

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:27.070
- It's like that.
- Oh, no, you didn't!

01:50:27.278 --> 01:50:30.990
Wait a minute! No, you...
Hey, hey, Jake!

01:50:31.199 --> 01:50:34.702
Hey! Jake! Jake!

01:50:34.911 --> 01:50:36.913
Jake, come back here!

01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:39.540
Jake!

01:50:42.085 --> 01:50:45.380
You disloyal, fool-ass,
bitch-made punk.

01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:49.467
I need my money!

01:50:51.928 --> 01:50:53.346
Jake!

01:50:56.307 --> 01:51:00.103
Oh, you motherfuckers! Okay.

01:51:00.436 --> 01:51:03.982
All right! I'm putting cases
on all you bitches!

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:07.568
Huh? You think you can do this shit?
Jake!

01:51:08.403 --> 01:51:10.822
You think you can do this to me?!

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:15.702
You motherfuckers will be playing
basketball in Pelican Bay...

01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:18.288
...when I get finished with you!

01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:20.957
Shoe program, nigga!

01:51:21.666 --> 01:51:23.876
Twenty-three hour lock-down!

01:51:24.085 --> 01:51:26.212
I'm the man up in this piece!

01:51:26.879 --> 01:51:29.882
Who you think you fucking with?!

01:51:30.091 --> 01:51:34.846
I'm the police! I run shit here!
You just live here!

01:51:35.972 --> 01:51:38.516
That's right, you better walk away.

01:51:38.725 --> 01:51:41.394
I'm gonna burn this motherfucker down!

01:51:41.978 --> 01:51:45.815
King Kong ain't got shit on me!

01:51:57.535 --> 01:52:00.330
That's all right. That's all right.

01:52:00.538 --> 01:52:02.582
Shit, I don't fuck...

01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:06.127
I'm winning anyway. I'm winning.

01:52:07.003 --> 01:52:09.881
I'm winning anyway. I can't lose.

01:52:10.381 --> 01:52:14.594
Shit, you can shoot me,
but you can't kill me.

01:52:20.725 --> 01:52:23.061
Oh, what a day.

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:25.396
What a motherfucking day!
