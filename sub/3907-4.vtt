-I gave it to her.
-What the fuck you do that for?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.303

-That’s messed up, Rick.

No, sure, granted, but they called you
slow, small, weak.

That's why you went undrafted,
isn't it, Victor?

real competition. You're not good enough."

after getting hit?

14:53.477 --> 14:54.808
Uh, we recovered the ball.

or your actual memory?

15:05.781 --> 15:07.362
Okay. Uh...

15:09.534 --> 15:14.995

the following set of downs after we scored.

21:11.479 --> 21:14.061
-"Rumblings"?
-Nothing specific. Murmurs. Guys are talking.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.140
I don't know shit about murmurs,
rumblings, or any of that shit,

21:16.234 --> 21:19.647
but I do know I'm gonna stick
my size-11 Air Jordan up somebody's ass.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.989
The organization will not respond well to that.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.062
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

21:23.700 --> 21:26.908
Now, if you screw with team chemistry,
it will not shine kindly on either of us.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.906
-I gambled on you.
-And I appreciate you, Mr. Siefert,

21:28.997 --> 21:30.407
for giving me this opportunity.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.786
All I want to do is play football
without looking over my shoulder.

21:33.877 --> 21:36.243
You're a man of faith.
Try turning the other cheek.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.501
Yeah, you're right. Okay.
All right, do the godly thing.

21:40.592 --> 21:44.130
Good. Now I want to suggest something else
that I think will help.

21:44.220 --> 21:45.426
It's called a mantra.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.554
You mean like a sexual thing?

21:49.934 --> 21:51.310
No.

21:51.394 --> 21:54.227
It's a phrase you repeat to yourself
to help control the rage.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.898
It goes like this,
"I am bigger than my problems."

21:58.735 --> 22:00.145
I'm bigger than my problems.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.524
When Alonzo or anybody else
does something to get under your skin,

22:03.615 --> 22:05.947
you just say this till the anger subsides.

22:06.034 --> 22:08.150
-Go on, try it. Close your eyes.
-Okay.

22:08.244 --> 22:09.745
All right. All right.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.528
I'm bigger than my problems.

22:12.624 --> 22:13.989
Breathe deep. That's the key.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.285
(EXHALES) I'm bigger than my problems.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.370
In through the nose, out through the mouth.

22:20.757 --> 22:21.963
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

22:23.843 --> 22:25.583
I am bigger than my problems.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.219
I am bigger than my problems.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.175
I am bigger than my problems.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.102
Open your eyes. How you feeling?

22:39.776 --> 22:41.107
Like I'm bigger than my problems.

22:42.237 --> 22:46.196
-There you go.
-Oh, shit. This shit's legit.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.488
What, Shula teach you that?

22:47.575 --> 22:50.942
Phil Jackson seminar. The Zen Master.
Got me through my first divorce.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.699
Well, it's clutch, bro.
And I can't thank you enough

22:53.790 --> 22:55.655
for opening these doors and being a friend.

22:56.834 --> 22:58.119
Here, take this.

22:58.628 --> 23:01.085
-What is it?
-That's where you'll find your car, Ricky.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.673
My car's not a car, Mr. Siefert.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.289
It's a Ferrari.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.511
-Thanks for everything.
-Okay.

23:07.595 --> 23:08.880
Close the door on your way out.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.012
I'm bigger than my problems.

23:11.349 --> 23:14.307

23:21.401 --> 23:23.187
Hey, Joe, we gotta do this again.

23:23.778 --> 23:26.110
JOE: Any time, man. You just say the word.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.196
You're a fun dude, Joey.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.696
-You are fun, Joe-Joe.
-You're a fun dude, Joey.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.573
You're a fun dude and a lot more.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.155
-| underestimated you, Joe.
-Oh, that happens all the time.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.956
Shit, I'm a fucking dead man.

23:46.009 --> 23:48.170
Hey, Victor, come here for a minute, man.

23:49.345 --> 23:52.758
Listen, urn, all those guys
that got drafted when you didn't,

23:52.849 --> 23:54.430
how did you prove to everybody
that you were better?

23:54.517 --> 23:56.758
-By busting my ass.
-Yeah, you wanted it more, right?

23:56.853 --> 23:58.468
-Absolutely.
-Same with me and Spencer.

23:58.563 --> 24:01.270
There's no magic formula to what it is we do.

24:01.357 --> 24:04.099
All financial firms are more or less the same.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

24:04.193 --> 24:07.481
But what separates us is the work we put in
all phases of the game.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.437
We're building something big, right?

24:09.532 --> 24:11.944
We're building something huge.
We're building something great.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.117
And we're gonna make a lot of people
a lot of money.

24:14.203 --> 24:15.329
We want you to be part of it.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.242
-Let's set up a meeting.
-Yeah, okay.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.699
Okay, good. Good, good, good.
I got your number, all right?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.408
-Sounds good.
-Uh-oh. What's happening?

24:22.503 --> 24:24.880
-Uh-oh.
-What's he doing? What's he doing now?

24:25.256 --> 24:26.371
-(LAUGHS)
-Did he just get a touchdown?

24:26.466 --> 24:28.252
-That's actually pretty good.
-It's pretty good, right?

24:28.343 --> 24:31.005
Don't underestimate me, man.
I keep telling you.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.960
Hey, Mr. Anderson.

24:33.056 --> 24:36.765
Say hello to our potential
new client, Victor Cruz.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.011
Nice boat, Mr. Anderson.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.055
Hi, Katya.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.387
We'll get off. We'll get off. Let's go.

24:44.025 --> 24:47.233
See, there she is.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.989
Wow, I've never seen them do that before.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.734
(GASPING) I am...

24:56.871 --> 25:00.455
Ooh, I am bigger than my problems.
I am bigger...

25:00.541 --> 25:03.078
I am bigger than my... What the fuck!

26:00.184 --> 26:01.685
Yo, Spence, what you doing here, man?

26:01.769 --> 26:03.851
Ladies, do you mind
if I steal him for a minute?

26:03.938 --> 26:05.144
-Not at all.
-Sure, go ahead.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.096
-You're hot.
-(LAUGHING)

26:07.191 --> 26:10.649
-Did you just say that?
-Yeah. I know.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.103
Keep your panties on, all right?
Please. Excuse me.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.776
-Spence.
-I said talk to Vernon. Only Vernon.

26:15.867 --> 26:18.574
Yo, fuck you, man.
When it comes to dollars, I go wherever he go.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.277
-What the fuck did you just say to me?
-Hey, come on, chill, Spencer.

26:21.706 --> 26:23.287
You know I don't talk money without Reggie.

26:23.374 --> 26:25.581
-You hung up on Jason?
-No, I did.

26:26.961 --> 26:30.249
Vernon, he got you
$71 million with 40 of it guaranteed.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.830
That's enough money
to take care of your family, buy Morn a house,

26:32.925 --> 26:35.007
and do whatever you need to do
for the kids in the community.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.710
-It's a good deal, Spence.
-But that's not the number we wanted.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.591
-So, we shouldn't have to settle.
-"We," huh?

26:40.475 --> 26:44.309
Is he the one putting his body on the line?
His bones, his blood, his sweat?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.932
He's been here from the start.
It's called loyalty.

26:47.023 --> 26:48.183
Well, thank you.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.356
What about your loyalty to Jason, huh?

26:51.444 --> 26:53.981
He went toe-to-toe with one of
the toughest negotiators in the league

26:54.071 --> 26:55.982
and he came back to you with a contract

26:56.073 --> 26:58.735
that makes you one of the highest paid
defensive players in the game.

26:58.826 --> 27:00.782
Vernon, I need you to smarten up.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.826
We let the next contract be about your ego.

27:02.914 --> 27:07.078
Right now the only thing that matters
is $40 million guaranteed.

27:07.168 --> 27:08.908
We're not afraid to play
the free agency market.

27:09.003 --> 27:11.460
If he gets hurt, you get nothing.
Both of you get nothing.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.959
-I'm not gonna get hurt.
-You know how many times I've heard that?

27:14.050 --> 27:16.291
You got to think positive, Spencer. Come on.

27:20.932 --> 27:21.921
Is this your final answer?

27:22.016 --> 27:25.349
Look, I love and I respect you, cuz,
but it is what it is.

27:26.354 --> 27:28.310
I'm sorry, Spence. It'sjust business.

27:28.731 --> 27:30.346
Okay, well, here's my final answer.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.265
You do whatever the hell you want to do.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.318
And when you realize, Vernon,
this has been the mistake of a lifetime,

27:35.404 --> 27:36.814
-don't come running back to me.
-(YAWNS)

27:36.906 --> 27:38.771
Because the moment
you give me my 300K back,

27:38.866 --> 27:41.699
me and you, my friend, we're done. Fuck off.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.401
Yo, Spencer. Come on, man.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.493
-Come back here. Why you got to be like that?
-Let his ass go.
