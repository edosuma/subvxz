01:59.240 --> 02:00.924
Don't think I don't see you, little one.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.364
I think there's enough
for both of us, though.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.207
<i>Mary.</i>

02:19.000 --> 02:20.206
Fear not,

02:20.680 --> 02:24.128
for you have been favored by God
to conceive and bear a son.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.647
A son?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.251
But how?

02:28.560 --> 02:30.480
The Holy Spirit will overshadow you,

02:30.560 --> 02:32.483
and the child will be called the Son of God.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.282
For nothing is impossible with God.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.600
Thank you.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.445
Do I say thank you? I mean, yes.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.003
Let it be done, just as you say.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.564
Guys! Guys!

03:07.440 --> 03:09.204
You're not gonna believe this!

03:48.600 --> 03:50.240
Okay. You are not gonna believe this,

03:50.320 --> 03:52.600
but I think a new star
just appeared in the sky...

03:52.680 --> 03:53.760
No, no, no.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.440
What have I said
about looking through that thing?

03:56.520 --> 03:57.880
Come on. Wait.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.291
This doesn't happen every day.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.883
There's nothing out there for you, kid.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.720
Things are changing.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.450
That star means something.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.925
And I'm not gonna be here forever.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.400
I love the smell of freshly
ground grain in the morning.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.120
Kid, your unemployed bird friend's here.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.247
Dave!

04:36.920 --> 04:38.729
- Hey, pal.
- What's new out there today?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.523
You know, not a whole lot.

04:41.880 --> 04:42.880
I mean, it's Nazareth.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.800
That rooster on Fifth Street overslept again.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.120
And, that horse...

04:46.200 --> 04:48.280
What is his name? Jeremiah? Hezekiah?

04:48.360 --> 04:49.600
There's an "iah" in there. I know that.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.727
He lost a shoe.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.444
And then, well...

04:52.600 --> 04:53.960
I mean, it's barely worth mentioning,

04:54.040 --> 04:57.600
but the royal caravan is rolling
through town today.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.200
What? The royal caravan?

04:59.280 --> 05:01.400
- Are you kidding?
- No, buddy! For real!

05:01.480 --> 05:02.840
I spotted them outside of town

05:02.920 --> 05:04.720
and had to come straight here to tell you.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.360
Today's the day we've been waiting for.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.240
Nazareth can kiss my gleaming
white tail feathers good-bye.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.846
See? I told you that star was a sign.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.765
We're meant for something greater than this.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.600
This is our job, and once you accept that,

05:17.680 --> 05:19.887
you'll be a glowing picture of happiness.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.401
Like me.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.240
We're talking about the royal caravan here.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.651
It's the ultimate job.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.720
<i>You get to go from town to town,
see the world, visit important people,</i>

05:32.800 --> 05:35.080
<i>and you get to march
with the biggest, strongest,</i>

05:35.160 --> 05:37.040
<i>greatest horses in the world.</i>

05:37.120 --> 05:38.120
Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave!

05:38.200 --> 05:40.600
<i>All the animals in every town
watching us go by.</i>

05:40.680 --> 05:41.680
Dave! Dave! Dave!

05:41.760 --> 05:43.888
<i>And we'll finally be doing
something important.</i>

05:45.800 --> 05:48.087
A miniature donkey in the royal caravan?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.680
- That'll be the day.
- Don't listen to him.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.120
And what's a dove gonna do,
carry one grape at a time?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.680
At least he's not
locked up in a mill like us.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.081
I'm telling you,
folks in this town just don't get it.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.080
And, I could carry two grapes,

06:01.160 --> 06:03.003
one in each talon, thank you very much.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.681
Bells.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.006
Wait. Bells.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.721
That's them.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.681
It's time to activate Operation Prison Break.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.600
Okay.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.960
All I have to do is kick
this sharp metal killer stick

06:22.040 --> 06:23.520
towards my head and duck.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.720
It'll cut your harness...

06:24.800 --> 06:25.920
And I'll finally be free.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
I love Operation Prison Break.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.889
- Such a good idea.
- Here we go.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.201
Okay, that's not good.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.521
Oh, boy.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.564
See? I knew that would work.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.681
Just like we planned.

06:54.520 --> 06:56.329
With a momentary near-death hiccup.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.610
Well, old-timer, it's been real.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.331
- Good luck to you.
- Wait, Dave.

07:00.640 --> 07:01.720
We can't just leave him.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.291
Buddy, I get where you're coming from,

07:03.400 --> 07:06.120
but it's the royal caravan,
not the retirement caravan.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.565
Look at him. He's like 300 years old.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.770
All right. What's going on in...

07:21.720 --> 07:23.723
Now, this ought to keep you where you belong.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.488
You're nothing but a great big, rotten...

07:34.280 --> 07:35.361
Oh, boy.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.640
...good-for-nothing bully!

07:39.720 --> 07:41.529
Yeah, you better walk away.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.171
Who needs the royal caravan?

07:44.600 --> 07:47.046
There's plenty of excitement
here in Nazareth.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.802
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm very upset right now.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.129
I'm gonna go find someone to poop on.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.170
If that miller thinks
this yoke is gonna stop me...

07:57.520 --> 08:00.720
Boy, do I have a surprise for him.

08:00.800 --> 08:04.248
I'll be riding with kings any day now.
You'll see.

08:15.960 --> 08:16.960
Still no Mary.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.560
Okay. Just a little late.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.000
It's normal to be late
to your wedding feast. Totally normal.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.880
Just like it's normal to talk to yourself.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.040
There he is!

08:24.120 --> 08:25.200
- Hey.
- Hi, Joseph.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.281
Looking good!

08:30.960 --> 08:32.769
Mary. You made it.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.924
You look beautiful.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.246
So do you.

08:39.200 --> 08:40.280
Well, handsome.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.767
I've missed you.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.320
You're a little late, you know.
I was starting to worry.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.527
Sorry.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.680
That's our fault. We're always late.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.411
"We" who? You were driving.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.607
She was such a big help to us
these past several months.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.320
- Wasn't she, John?
- Sorry, big guy.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.280
I know how great she is,
but I'm taking her back.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.407
Joseph?

09:00.840 --> 09:02.920
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.120
Of course.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.124
And, just warning you,
it might be a lot to take in.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.400
Mary, it's our wedding feast.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.084
Of course. You can tell me anything.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.487
She's here!

09:18.240 --> 09:20.160
Sorry, what did you want to talk about?

09:20.240 --> 09:21.685
It can wait.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.211
Let's enjoy the party.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.960
So, any new escape plans, kid?

09:31.040 --> 09:32.087
What's the point?

09:32.920 --> 09:35.880
I'm always gonna be stuck on the
same old wheel with the same old view.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.405
What's wrong with the view?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.884
I know it feels like
we're just going in circles.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.689
- We are.
- Look, kid.

09:48.920 --> 09:50.206
We're mill donkeys.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.960
We grind grain. We don't carry kings.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.041
Yeah.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.121
Should've listened to you
and given up a long time ago.

10:14.320 --> 10:15.480
What is happening?

10:15.560 --> 10:17.802
Kid, it's my leg. Go get help.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.330
These good-for-nothing animals.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.841
What is it now?

10:27.120 --> 10:28.724
Just what I needed.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.803
- Are the gates open?
- What?

10:34.920 --> 10:36.040
- Yeah.
- You!

10:36.120 --> 10:37.531
What are you doing...

10:39.520 --> 10:40.960
Kid, get out of here.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.280
Wait, but I thought you said...

10:42.720 --> 10:44.768
- What about you?
- I'll be fine.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.407
I just hope you find what you're looking for.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.006
I don't know what to say.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.486
You're welcome, kid.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.960
Now, get going.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.165
No, you don't!

10:58.440 --> 11:00.443
You're free, kid. Make it count.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.681
What?

11:12.680 --> 11:13.807
Where do you think you're going?

11:14.400 --> 11:15.731
Get back here!

11:16.000 --> 11:17.320
Look, I'm not gonna be here long.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.280
Runaway donkey! Somebody grab him!

11:19.360 --> 11:21.040
Sorry, hon. Looks like I'm leaving
sooner than I thought.

11:21.120 --> 11:22.326
Never forget me!

11:23.080 --> 11:25.925
You broke out! Yes, the dream is back on.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.680
See, not free yet.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.091
The miller! The miller's on my tail!

11:29.200 --> 11:31.200
Yeah, and he does not look happy.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.640
I am not happy!

11:32.720 --> 11:33.720
Follow me.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.840
- This way. Up here.
- No, no, not up.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.411
No, donkey don't like up!

11:45.080 --> 11:46.445
Sorry. Sorry.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.370
I'm a really nice guy.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.885
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

11:59.080 --> 12:00.286
- What now?
- Jump.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.090
Jump? What, are you crazy?

12:03.600 --> 12:04.601
Just jump!

12:09.600 --> 12:10.931
A flying donkey!

12:11.240 --> 12:13.686
Well, greetings, ladies.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.920
Wait a second. Are they eating chicken?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.684
Ladies, run!

12:29.040 --> 12:30.724
Other way. Other way!

12:35.120 --> 12:36.884
No, no. Where'd you go?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.411
Dave? Dave? Where are you?

12:43.920 --> 12:45.251
I got you now.

12:49.480 --> 12:50.527
No.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.411
- No, no, no.
- There's no way out of this.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.245
Here we go!

13:13.280 --> 13:15.089
Okay. Here goes.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.090
He's a good man. He'll understand.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.281
Thanks.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.962
Zechariah! Party's over.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.520
Let's go.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.760
Great party, guys.

13:27.840 --> 13:28.921
- Bye, now.
- Joseph,

13:29.160 --> 13:31.766
you must be the happiest man in the world.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.691
Or second happiest.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.720
Clearly, I'm the happiest.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.406
You know, I think I liked you better
when you couldn't talk.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.960
Our place is a mess.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.167
"Our place."

13:45.440 --> 13:46.567
I like the sound of that.

13:47.880 --> 13:48.961
Me, too.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.000
Well, this place isn't gonna clean itself.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.161
I'm starting with the dishes.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.368
Okay. And I'll start down here.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.922
Where I figure out how to tell him about you.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.929
It's all good news. Promise.

14:03.920 --> 14:04.967
All good news.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.481
Yep.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.651
I'm caught again.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.171
There's gotta be a better hiding place.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.091
Okay, maybe not here.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.201
Nope, not that one, either.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.286
Why couldn't I be smaller?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.363
The one time I wish I was smaller.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.324
No.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.491
You poor thing.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.281
You're hurt.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.687
What is she doing?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.281
That can't be good.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.406
If I'm going to help you,
you're gonna have to let me, okay?

15:17.040 --> 15:18.041
Okay.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.921
Better?

15:31.680 --> 15:33.762
Good. Nice to meet you.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.361
I'm Mary.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.040
Hey. You gonna bring me up any more dishes?

15:41.120 --> 15:43.088
You didn't tell me you had a donkey.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.521
I don't.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.885
No, he must be a stray.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.411
Go on, boy. Shoo!

15:57.560 --> 15:59.961
You're scrappy. Scrappy little donkey.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.685
Come on.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.122
All right, that's how it's gonna be?

16:14.920 --> 16:17.526
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. It's just a...

16:18.760 --> 16:21.640
Well, I'm glad to see
that the donkey survived.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.320
Poor little guy is hurt.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.120
- Give him a break.
- Hello!

16:25.200 --> 16:26.680
Has anyone lost a donkey?

16:26.760 --> 16:28.683
- Because, if you have, he's here!
- What should we call you?

16:28.800 --> 16:30.086
And I do not want him!

16:30.520 --> 16:32.160
How about...

16:32.240 --> 16:33.720
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Boaz.

16:33.800 --> 16:34.880
You're naming it?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.849
What do you think, Bo?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.611
Bo? No way.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.760
Bo's a good name for you. Isn't it?

16:40.840 --> 16:43.650
- Isn't it?
- Yeah, Bo's great. Love it.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.291
Mary, no.

16:45.560 --> 16:48.360
No, if you name him, you're gonna start
feeling affectionate toward him.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.440
And once you feel affectionate,
you're gonna want to keep him.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.808
And if there is one thing
we are definitely not going to do...

16:55.280 --> 16:56.771
Do you think he'll be warm enough down here?

16:59.560 --> 17:00.800
That's my workshop.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.483
Let's just let him stay here
till he's all better.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.251
Don't you think we should at least...

17:16.160 --> 17:17.287
Mary?

17:19.240 --> 17:21.367
Come on. Let's go talk upstairs.

17:27.119 --> 17:29.771
Okay...

17:31.120 --> 17:34.124
Finally. They are gone, and I am out of here.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.241
There you are.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.441
I am so glad you're okay.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.600
Do you know how much flying around
I have done looking for you?

17:49.680 --> 17:51.920
I thought that maybe the miller
caught you and was gonna eat you.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.880
Eat me? Yeah, I don't think
he was gonna do that.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.680
You don't know! He had crazy in his eyes.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.922
So keep it down.
He's still out there someplace.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.329
- Do you think he heard?
- Nah. I think we're good.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.926
This is the last place he'd check.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.965
Nothing special ever happens
in an old shack like this.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.487
The Messiah?

18:10.160 --> 18:13.448
You're saying that baby
is the actual Messiah?

18:14.080 --> 18:16.600
Like from the prophets?
I do need to sit down, actually.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.684
I know. I know how it sounds, but yes.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.808
And God wants you and me to raise him.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.528
Me? Are you sure...

18:28.400 --> 18:29.970
I mean, did the angel mention me?

18:30.880 --> 18:32.080
Well, no, but it's...

18:32.160 --> 18:34.000
Look, I can't raise the Son of God.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.280
He's a king. I'm just a carpenter.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.328
He needs someone with a little
more experience being...

18:38.880 --> 18:40.530
I don't know, king-ish?

18:40.720 --> 18:41.847
I mean, who am I?

18:44.760 --> 18:46.205
You're my husband.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.600
I am so sorry.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.960
This is just so much to take in right now.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.963
Can I have a little time?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.404
Okay. We got it this time.

19:06.040 --> 19:07.720
We're making progress, though, right?

19:07.800 --> 19:09.643
Hate to say it, but even if we got you out,

19:09.880 --> 19:11.803
you're never gonna make it
to the royal caravan on that leg.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.727
Dave, look, I don't want to hold you back.

19:14.840 --> 19:15.967
You fly ahead without me.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.641
I'll catch up once my leg heals.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.160
No. We're in this together,
and I'm not gonna leave you here.

19:20.240 --> 19:21.760
- Friends don't do that.
- Are you sure?

19:21.840 --> 19:24.491
Yeah, and besides,
you'd never make it without me.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.280
I am a bird of the world.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.283
I know how things work out there.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.324
You are a donkey of a barn.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.125
A very small, ill-smelling barn.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.051
- You need me.
- Okay.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.407
So, now what?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.523
Hide out here until your leg heals,

19:37.640 --> 19:39.360
and then just get yourself kicked out.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.124
And we'll be back on track, pal.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.646
Bo, actually.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.200
My name is Bo now. Mary named me.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.281
"Bo."

19:46.720 --> 19:48.760
That's got a nice ring to... Wait.

19:48.840 --> 19:50.570
That lady person named you?

19:50.680 --> 19:53.360
I said hide here,
not settle in and get a name.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.001
- Have I taught you nothing?
- No one is settling in, okay?

19:57.200 --> 20:01.240
Once my leg is healed,
it's time for Operation Kick Me Out.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.480
Good. Now, I'm an expert
at this type of thing, so listen up.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.688
Things I found that tend to tick people off.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.485
Jumping out and scaring them.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.449
Singing really loudly early in the morning.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.569
Staring at them while they eat.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.005
At the risk of stating the obvious,
a well-placed number two.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.441
Breaking things.

20:16.760 --> 20:17.761
Setting things on fire.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.004
Licking things that don't want to be licked.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.810
<i>What child is this</i>

20:27.280 --> 20:31.080
<i>Who laid to rest</i>

20:32.560 --> 20:36.281
<i>On Mary's lap</i>

20:37.960 --> 20:41.169
<i>ls sleeping</i>

20:43.440 --> 20:47.809
<i>Whom angels greet</i>

20:48.760 --> 20:52.890
<i>With anthems sweet</i>

20:53.600 --> 20:57.200
<i>While shepherds watch</i>

20:57.280 --> 20:58.611
<i>Joseph.</i>

20:59.320 --> 21:02.927
<i>Are keeping?</i>

21:05.240 --> 21:10.200
<i>This, this is Christ the King</i>

21:10.280 --> 21:15.760
<i>Whom shepherds guard and angels sing</i>

21:15.840 --> 21:18.120
<i>Haste, haste</i>

21:18.200 --> 21:20.851
<i>To bring him laud</i>

21:20.960 --> 21:26.729
<i>The babe, the Son of Mary.</i>

21:33.640 --> 21:34.846
<i>Wait a minute! Wait a minute!</i>

21:34.960 --> 21:37.160
<i>We three kings</i>

21:37.240 --> 21:39.607
<i>Of Orient are</i>

21:40.240 --> 21:42.560
<i>Bearing gifts</i>

21:42.640 --> 21:45.007
<i>We traverse afar</i>

21:45.720 --> 21:48.000
<i>Field and fountain</i>

21:48.080 --> 21:49.120
<i>Moor and mountain</i>

21:49.200 --> 21:50.360
Hang on!

21:50.440 --> 21:52.920
<i>- Following yonder star</i>
- Cyrus! Deborah!

21:53.040 --> 21:55.320
Come on, guys! Wait up!

21:55.400 --> 21:57.600
I expected a left turn two deserts ago.

21:57.680 --> 21:58.680
I'm dying back here!

21:58.760 --> 22:00.400
I can't believe we passed that last oasis.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.323
- I'm getting thirsty.
- Lost!

22:03.520 --> 22:05.124
These wise guys are lost.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.160
Wise men don't get lost, Felix.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.680
So you're saying they know
where this birthday party is?

22:09.760 --> 22:12.080
And what makes you so certain
it's a birthday party?

22:12.160 --> 22:13.161
Here we go.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.880
Have you seen the presents
these guys are bringing?

22:15.960 --> 22:18.480
Gold, myrrh, frankincense.

22:18.560 --> 22:19.846
Could be a baby shower.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.520
- You bring gifts to a baby shower.
- Baby shower?

22:22.600 --> 22:25.320
What is a baby gonna do
with frankincense, silly camel?

22:25.400 --> 22:26.891
It's a birthday party.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.320
Baby shower.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.640
- Birthday party.
- Baby shower.

22:29.720 --> 22:30.840
Birthday party.

22:30.920 --> 22:31.920
- Baby shower.
- Birthday party!

22:32.000 --> 22:33.400
What if it's not a party at all?

22:33.480 --> 22:36.928
What if we're on our way
to do something important like,

22:37.040 --> 22:39.520
I don't know, meeting the Son of God?

22:41.680 --> 22:44.570
Deborah's crazier than a box of rocks.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.840
I believe the expression is,
"Dumb as a box of rocks."

22:48.920 --> 22:50.320
You ever shake a box of rocks?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.720
They sound crazy.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.280
<i>You're westward leading</i>

22:55.040 --> 22:57.088
<i>Still you're proceeding</i>

22:57.760 --> 23:01.321
<i>Guide us to the light</i>

23:07.760 --> 23:09.683
So floridly written.

23:10.480 --> 23:12.360
It makes one wonder how the emperor

23:12.440 --> 23:15.091
has so much time for counting his subjects.

23:15.520 --> 23:20.765
But if Caesar decrees a census,
then a census he will get.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.520
Send the royal guard to round up
every man and woman.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.968
- Sire.
- Let the counting of the sheep begin.

23:27.360 --> 23:31.331
Your Majesty, three magi
bearing gifts for the king.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.648
Hold it right there, camels.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.120
I bet they can play that game we made up.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.720
That was fun. What was it called again?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.086
"How High."

23:44.800 --> 23:48.009
On three. One, two...

23:48.600 --> 23:49.681
Three!

23:54.760 --> 23:56.444
- How high?
- Camel high.

24:01.400 --> 24:04.882
Your gifts are unexpected,
though not unwelcome.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.480
Your Majesty, these gifts are not for you.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.563
Yes, they're for the new king.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.244
- What new king?
- The one foretold by the star.

24:15.240 --> 24:16.240
I knew it.

24:16.320 --> 24:18.080
It's a birthday party for the new king.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.120
No, no. I'm pretty certain
it's a baby shower.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.680
Or maybe they're referring
to the coming Messiah.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.327
The Son of God.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.647
Okay, now I'm starting to worry about her.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.805
Deborah, are you okay?

24:32.120 --> 24:34.248
How many hooves am I holding up?

24:35.840 --> 24:37.360
Now bring in my scribes.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.640
There is a prophecy.

24:38.720 --> 24:39.926
What are they saying?

24:40.200 --> 24:44.240
I can't make it out, but it's something
about the king of the... Shoes?

24:44.320 --> 24:46.448
King of the shoes? That's what this is about?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.480
- That can't be right.
- Look!

24:48.560 --> 24:51.280
Look! Dude has gold slippers.
King of the shoes, no doubt.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.760
That, Felix, is money and no taste.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.120
Can we move past the shoes?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.760
- I think...
- Look at that guy.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.600
- You see him?
- He's just the royal dog walker.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.400
Trust me. Felix, I know these things.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.080
What? Dog walker?

25:02.160 --> 25:03.924
He's like a nightmare wearing a helmet.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.282
We must find this king at once.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.888
I will set my scribes to the task.

25:11.120 --> 25:15.887
In the meantime, I invite you to stay
in the palace as my royal guests.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.886
No, no, that's not necessary, sire.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.491
But, I insist.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.640
Okay. That was sinister.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.960
Yep. We're leaving.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.602
We're not gonna do any slumber parties
with any evil shoe kings.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.051
No, thank you.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.441
Too late.

25:41.720 --> 25:44.769
This new king is a problem.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.446
Get rid of the problem.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.851
The room was filled with magical light.

26:06.040 --> 26:10.728
And then the angel said
that the child would be the new king.

26:11.600 --> 26:12.681
New king?

26:13.360 --> 26:15.567
And I thought, "I'm not ready to be a mom."

26:16.240 --> 26:18.527
But then I realized
the angel was talking to the lady.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.882
Wait, wait. I'm not done.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.211
That's usually everyone's favorite part.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.441
Nice story, rat. Here's how it ends.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.040
The end.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.929
Rufus, spit it out.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.730
We need that rat to talk.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.360
I am not a rat.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.600
- I'm a pygmy jerboa.
- What's a jerboa?

26:42.680 --> 26:46.440
It is in the rodent family
but an entirely different species.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.887
Rufus, enough. Spit it out.

26:49.800 --> 26:52.485
I was just starting to
get a little bit of the flavor.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.289
You've been telling this story
to every critter in Galilee.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.888
Now it's our turn to hear it.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.487
From the beginning.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.485
From the beginning?

27:05.000 --> 27:07.207
Okay. Well...

27:08.040 --> 27:10.480
I was born in a sack of barley
somewhere in Capernaum.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.802
Skip to the end! Who's the woman?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.960
Her name is Mary. She lives in Nazareth.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.800
But, please, don't hurt her.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.360
- She's really nice.
- Don't worry.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.530
We're harmless.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.205
That's mine!

27:39.480 --> 27:40.480
No.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.005
Mary!

27:43.960 --> 27:45.485
Looks like you're healed up.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.160
Feeling better?

27:49.240 --> 27:51.680
All I'm saying is it's unfair, you know,

27:51.760 --> 27:54.809
to make all these people
drop everything for the census.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.760
And for us to travel to Bethlehem,
especially in your condition.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.680
Joseph, I'm not dying.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.842
It's just a little road trip. We'll be fine.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.520
This feels right.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.240
You know, Mary, most donkeys have to work.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.400
You are spoiling him.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.005
She is spoiling you.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.690
Hey, look at you.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.007
- Your leg's all better.
- Hey, Dave.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.760
All right, time to activate
Operation Kick Me Out.

28:20.840 --> 28:21.880
What's your plan of attack?

28:21.960 --> 28:25.960
First, I thought I'd let her finish
this belly rub.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.200
Snap out of it!

28:27.280 --> 28:28.280
A little bird named Methuselah

28:28.360 --> 28:31.569
told me the royal caravan will be
passing through not too far from here.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.045
We can catch them if we leave soon.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.730
All right, let's get kicked out of here.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.480
All packed up. Is the donkey ready?

28:37.560 --> 28:39.320
Yes, his leg looks good as new.

28:39.400 --> 28:40.845
Finally. Time for him to earn his keep.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.200
All right, Bo, let's get you
hitched up to this cart

28:43.280 --> 28:44.771
so you can take us to Bethlehem.

28:45.480 --> 28:47.164
- Bethlehem?
- Bethlehem?

28:47.400 --> 28:48.760
Not good, not good.

28:48.840 --> 28:50.729
The royal caravan is nowhere near Bethlehem.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.365
Don't worry. He's gotta catch me first.

29:01.760 --> 29:05.447
- Joseph, maybe if you just...
- Don't worry, Mary. I've got this.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.443
Well, looks like you got me.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.091
Come here!

29:27.440 --> 29:29.283
- That looked like it hurt.
- It did.

29:30.440 --> 29:31.805
- How was that?
- Bo, look out!

29:35.080 --> 29:36.764
Come on. See?

29:37.160 --> 29:38.730
Under control.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.406
Joseph!

29:41.800 --> 29:43.600
No, no, I'm okay.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.160
You know what? We can walk to Bethlehem.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.886
- No problem.
- Useless donkey.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.880
- Nicely done.
- I thought so.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.880
Did you see how I laid him out on the ground?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.327
Those caravan horses have nothing on you.

29:57.440 --> 29:59.443
- Okay, so now what?
- Easy.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.840
All we have to do is slip through the gate

30:01.920 --> 30:03.490
when they're on their way out.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.807
No, no, no, don't close the gate!

30:06.840 --> 30:08.570
Don't worry. We'll be back soon.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.963
I guess that was good-bye?

30:21.520 --> 30:23.921
You're not gonna cry, are you?

30:24.320 --> 30:26.766
Come on, we gotta figure out a way
to open this thing.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.689
This is what I get
for having a friend who can't fly.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.840
You know what? Gates were never
a problem before I met you.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.960
There's gotta be something we can use here.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.200
There's that table, that lumber, those tools.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.010
A giant knife.

30:52.040 --> 30:53.167
Hide!

31:04.600 --> 31:06.682
Okay, Bo. What haven't you told me?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.484
- You been making some new friends?
- No.

31:09.080 --> 31:12.243
I bet the miller sent them
to bring me back to the mill.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.001
- They left the gate open.
- I'll make a run for it.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.720
Dave, you jump out and create a distraction.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.960
What? No. Terrible plan.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.282
Why don't you make the distraction
and I run for it?

31:22.400 --> 31:25.210
Because I'm the one trapped in here,
and you can fly,

31:25.360 --> 31:27.442
- as you like to keep telling me.
- All valid points.

31:28.440 --> 31:29.840
I got a scent.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.840
I smell a dog!

31:31.920 --> 31:33.800
Thaddeus, there's definitely a dog here.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.211
Yeah!

31:35.400 --> 31:38.404
- I smell me.
- Hey! Scary dogs!

31:38.680 --> 31:40.330
You guys here for the show?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.730
- What show?
- What...

31:44.520 --> 31:46.807
"What show," the silly dog asks.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.280
You're adorable.

31:48.360 --> 31:51.967
"The Dance of the Royal Dove," of course.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.243
Played in Rome six years.

31:54.400 --> 31:55.686
Great reviews.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.564
Caesar saw it twice. Made him cry.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.080
He won't admit that because,
you know, he's Caesar and all.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.640
But he definitely cried like a baby.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.760
- But I digress.
- We don't have time for this.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.161
No! Wait! The show is about to start.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.363
Okay. You can...

32:23.840 --> 32:26.002
What are you doing? Don't watch me.

32:26.680 --> 32:29.763
Yeah. This bird can dance.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.400
No, guys. Guys, guys, guys, no,
this is the best part.

32:37.480 --> 32:38.760
Okay, there you go. They're gone.

32:38.840 --> 32:41.127
- Where's your owner?
- Yeah! Where's your owner?

32:41.280 --> 32:43.600
Who, the miller? I don't know a miller.

32:43.680 --> 32:46.923
My owner's a nice pregnant lady.
You would love her.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.128
- That's her.
- Where is she?

32:49.240 --> 32:53.325
Wait, you're looking for Mary?
Did I say "pregnant lady?"

32:53.640 --> 32:55.085
I meant "miller."

32:55.200 --> 32:57.282
I'm just a mill donkey on vacation.

32:57.480 --> 33:00.370
- Who's Mary?
- Keep talking.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.360
Okay, that was pathetic.
Let me handle this, Bo.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.480
- Guys, donkeys are stubborn.
- Yeah.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.130
- He's not gonna tell you anything.
- Sorry, guys.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.000
You would have to torture it out of him.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.445
Wait, what?

33:14.520 --> 33:17.205
- He didn't bandage himself.
- That's her scent.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.323
Now we just gotta figure out
which way she went.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.528
We'll tell her you said hello.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.327
They left the gate open.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.560
Okay. The royal caravan is right this way.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.880
We'll catch it in no time.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.400
Wait. Where you going? Dream is that way.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.926
- Right, but Mary is this way.
- No.

33:47.040 --> 33:49.088
Royal caravan cannot wait
for a rescue mission.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.080
Especially when that guy is after her.
He is major bad news.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.160
I'm not gonna just let her get hurt, Dave.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.480
- She was nice to me.
- Come on, Bo.

33:57.560 --> 34:00.484
- We've been waiting for this.
- It'll just take a second.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.640
Once Mary's safe, we'll turn right around

34:02.720 --> 34:04.200
and join the royal caravan.

34:04.280 --> 34:08.045
- Deal?
- Fine! Deal.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.884
So we turn right around.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.889
Okay, leave this to me. I know a shortcut.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.440
He'll lead us right to her.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.762
- And then what?
- Then we find the baby.

34:29.960 --> 34:31.880
That baby messed with the wrong dogs.

34:31.960 --> 34:35.521
Nothing scares us.
Not even a baby. Right, partner?

34:35.760 --> 34:37.400
Just stop.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.245
Thaddeus, do you think I'm bad at being bad?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.205
I got it.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.760
Okay, Dave, be honest.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.440
- Are we lost?
- No.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.560
'Cause this doesn't exactly
look like the beaten path.

35:03.640 --> 35:05.882
It's a shortcut. Trust me.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.200
Bo? Bo, right here. Look at me, buddy.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.248
Just breathe. Breathe.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.010
Breathe.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.800
Nope. That's it.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.884
No more of your terrible shortcuts. We are...

35:27.120 --> 35:29.720
Look. It's Mary. That's them.

35:29.800 --> 35:31.803
Guess we'll have to take
my terrible shortcut.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.485
You're welcome.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.400
Wait. No, no, no, no. Okay.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.000
Come on. Really?

35:38.080 --> 35:40.322
- Which way am I supposed to go?
- It's a cliff.

35:40.440 --> 35:41.965
You go down.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.760
- Hi.
- Could you help me get down, please?

36:03.840 --> 36:05.126
Just let go.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.646
- Here, let me.
- Wait, no, no, no.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.089
- I'm Ruth.
- Hi, Ruth. I'm Bo.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.927
Ruth? You're a little close.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.840
- You know, personal space?
- Sorry.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.120
Flocking. It's a sheep thing.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.045
So, what are you doing
all alone on a cliff like this?

36:35.120 --> 36:37.320
Well, actually,
I'm here with my friend, Dave.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.560
I'm meeting him at the bottom.
We're on the road to Bethlehem

36:39.640 --> 36:41.882
so we can catch up with
my friend Mary and save her.

36:42.080 --> 36:46.244
And once we do,
we will be joining the royal caravan.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.450
Sounds exciting.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.200
Well, I guess I'll get back
to following the star.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.280
The star? You mean the...

36:53.360 --> 36:55.680
- You mean that super bright one?
- Yeah, that one.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.444
Have you noticed
how it's been getting brighter?

36:57.600 --> 36:59.880
Totally. And the weird way
it kind of pulsates.

36:59.960 --> 37:01.200
Yes! It's like it's...

37:01.320 --> 37:03.400
- Like it means something.
- Exactly.

37:03.480 --> 37:06.848
Okay, come on. We're almost down.
One more chasm.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.680
This is really easy for you, isn't it?

37:10.760 --> 37:13.366
You got it, Bo. Just don't look down.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.930
Okay, great. Now, just...

37:20.080 --> 37:21.760
Just try to get your hooves in...

37:21.840 --> 37:24.969
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Spread-eagle.
We're going for a wedge thing here.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.960
That's it. You got it. You're a wedge.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.200
- How does that feel?
- Fantastic.

37:31.280 --> 37:35.080
Great. Okay. Next, just lift that hoof
and take a step down.

37:36.160 --> 37:39.562
- No, no, no.
- You can do it. Just one hoof at a time.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.121
That's it.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.924
What is taking him so long?

37:49.480 --> 37:52.080
Well, didn't exactly stick the landing,
but that was good.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.128
You're a fast learner.

37:54.280 --> 37:59.082
- Dave? Dave?
- I'm under you and in a lot of pain.

37:59.800 --> 38:01.962
- Dave?
- Yeah. Right here. On your butt.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.243
Come on. Let's get moving.

38:10.240 --> 38:13.960
You must be Dave.
I've heard great things about you.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.804
- I'm Ruth.
- Pleasure.

38:16.040 --> 38:19.169
Well, we've got places to be,
people to save, caravans to join.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.608
- See you around.
- Thanks, Ruth.

38:25.760 --> 38:28.889
Have you ever been to Bethlehem before?

38:29.160 --> 38:32.440
- We've never been anywhere before.
- Well, you're in for a treat.

38:32.520 --> 38:35.840
The Samaritan Mountains
are beautiful this time of year.

38:35.920 --> 38:38.651
Deadly steep, but great views.

38:40.040 --> 38:42.327
- You've been to Bethlehem?
- Are you kidding?

38:42.480 --> 38:45.080
I grew up around there.
I know all the ins and outs,

38:45.160 --> 38:47.402
how to avoid predators
and treacherous high cliffs.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.842
The treacherous cliffs.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.610
You're not really considering this, are you?

38:52.800 --> 38:54.404
Come on, Ruth. Lead the way.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.841
Sheep are usually better at following,
but I will do my best.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.611
- Let's go, flock.
- Yippee.

39:16.840 --> 39:19.650
- Felix, come on.
- Shouldn't we be sneaking out?

39:19.800 --> 39:22.280
Why are we sneaking in?

39:27.560 --> 39:31.201
King Herod is up to something.
And we are gonna find out what.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.766
With the help of a little
well-placed distraction.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.604
Come on, fellas. Hurry.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.720
Still no report from my hunter?

39:43.800 --> 39:46.451
- Has he found the child?
- No, sire.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.920
But your scribes are ready
to present their findings.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.526
Well, finally, someone's doing their job.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.324
So tell me where he is.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.440
According to the prophecy, Your Majesty,

39:55.520 --> 39:57.523
the new king is to be born in Bethlehem.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.960
And? That's all? To what family?

40:01.040 --> 40:03.520
Who are they? I am the king.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.560
I am the king of Judea.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.768
If you people can't find this one child,

40:12.960 --> 40:14.769
then I'll just have to kill them all.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.611
See? I told you.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.087
Shall we send soldiers to track him down?

40:21.760 --> 40:22.761
No.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.407
You three, come.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.800
- It's the wise men.
- Hide, quickly.

40:27.880 --> 40:31.521
- So, any word of the new king?
- Yes.

40:32.280 --> 40:35.045
Look for him in Bethlehem. You're free to go.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.487
Our humblest thanks, Your Majesty.

40:37.600 --> 40:41.082
When you find him, send word to me.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.846
I dearly wish to know where he is

40:44.160 --> 40:46.845
so that I, too, may honor him

40:49.120 --> 40:50.531
with a gift.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.360
You know, I think
he might be up to something.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.360
He's using the wise men
to track down the new king.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.683
Yeah! Plus, did you see him
crumple that flower?

41:05.960 --> 41:08.725
- We have to warn the new king.
- Pack your bags, boys.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.360
Looks like we're going to Bethlehem.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.640
And now our tour will continue
past these pebbles on the path.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.200
Watch your step. Watch your step.
And watch your step.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.324
I blame you for this.

41:20.640 --> 41:21.641
There they are.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.445
Come on.

41:35.720 --> 41:36.801
Mary.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.485
Are you sure you don't want
to sit in the cart?

41:38.600 --> 41:40.840
No, it's hard enough for you as it is.

41:40.920 --> 41:42.684
Just let me fix my boot.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.080
- I don't believe it.
- Really, I'm fine.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.129
No, not that. That.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.121
Bo?

41:52.120 --> 41:53.960
Mary. You're in danger.

41:54.040 --> 41:56.885
You need to listen to what I'm about
to say extremely carefully.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.400
You ever feel like he's trying to talk to us?

42:02.480 --> 42:04.403
Why is he here? Where did he come from?

42:04.920 --> 42:06.126
She's not getting it.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.328
Okay, new plan.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.960
Can you two act like dogs?

42:10.040 --> 42:13.560
- What do you think?
- Yes. I do a great dog.

42:13.640 --> 42:16.769
- Dogs are my fourth best animal.
- Great. Just follow my lead.

42:18.880 --> 42:22.726
"Look at me. I'm Mary. I'm so pregnant."

42:24.040 --> 42:26.805
"I'm Joseph. I'm in a bad mood."

42:27.640 --> 42:30.405
Wait, wait, wait. Is that supposed to be me?

42:31.200 --> 42:32.327
It's totally you.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.762
"No! Look! Here come the dogs!"

42:34.920 --> 42:36.081
That's you guys.

42:40.720 --> 42:43.120
Throw me a stick,
and I'll bring it right back.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.680
What's this? It's a tail?

42:44.760 --> 42:45.760
- I'm gonna get you.
- Seriously?

42:45.840 --> 42:47.365
We're doing this
instead of the royal caravan?

42:47.480 --> 42:50.882
No, Ruth, you're a scary dog. Just be meaner.

42:51.360 --> 42:54.887
Meaner? You mean like this!

42:56.960 --> 42:58.520
No! They got me!

42:58.600 --> 43:01.524
If only a certain donkey had warned me.

43:05.600 --> 43:08.560
There is something seriously
wrong with those animals.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.720
I think Bo's trying to tell us something.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.370
Come on, come on.

43:15.160 --> 43:20.451
I think he wants a belly rub.

43:20.560 --> 43:24.281
What? No. I mean, yes, always, but not now.

43:24.680 --> 43:25.920
This is not working.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.202
Guys, I hate to break this up,
but we've got trouble.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.040
- Mama!
- Those guys?

43:33.120 --> 43:35.360
Yeah, they've been following us
since we came down the cliff.

43:35.440 --> 43:37.120
Couldn't you have pointed that out sooner?

43:37.200 --> 43:39.040
No. They followed us right to her.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.726
Well, why don't we hide
in that big flock over there?

43:41.880 --> 43:43.484
That's what a sheep would do.

43:43.760 --> 43:45.205
Yes. Great idea.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.446
Bo, what are you...

43:47.560 --> 43:49.210
- Joseph?
- Right behind you.

43:51.240 --> 43:52.321
Okay.

43:52.600 --> 43:53.965
You must be really thirsty.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.800
I'm gonna grab some water. Do you want some?

43:55.880 --> 43:59.248
Sure. Yeah, I guess I'll just take
a look at that wheel, then.

44:01.960 --> 44:04.645
- Don't carry too much, okay?
- I won't.

44:05.800 --> 44:07.040
Sorry.

44:12.080 --> 44:15.243
- Fresh figs! Get your fresh figs here.
- I got them.

44:17.520 --> 44:20.205
Hello, sir. You look like a man
who appreciates fine pottery.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.401
I...

44:23.800 --> 44:26.326
Hurry up. We need three buckets of water.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.040
- Do you see anything?
- What are we looking for?

44:31.120 --> 44:32.640
What...

44:32.720 --> 44:34.640
Here we are, minutes away from being chopped

44:34.720 --> 44:37.400
into tiny little pieces
by a knife-wielding psycho.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.689
- We could've been riding with royalty.
- Look! They're here.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.720
Dave, let's try and lead them away.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.560
Ruth, you stay here and guard Mary.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.280
If they find her, get our attention.

44:46.360 --> 44:49.728
- Yeah. We should have a secret signal.
- Sounds great.

44:56.520 --> 44:57.726
Help me.

45:01.280 --> 45:03.931
Gosh. The signal. Okay.

45:24.440 --> 45:25.885
- No.
- I'll take care of this.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.005
Looks like it's up to me.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.526
Nope, too big. Too big.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.287
- Ruth, looks like it's up to you.
- Me?

45:39.440 --> 45:41.522
I knew this day would come.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.529
For the flock!

45:59.000 --> 46:00.411
Look out!

46:03.280 --> 46:05.362
- No!
- Get back! Get back!

46:11.640 --> 46:12.846
Watch out!

46:14.480 --> 46:15.720
Hold it up!

46:16.080 --> 46:17.207
No!

46:19.880 --> 46:20.927
Yes!

46:22.200 --> 46:24.203
Bo, are you okay?

46:25.320 --> 46:27.720
- What has gotten into you?
- That donkey did it.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.200
He destroyed everything.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.407
Did you do this?

46:30.520 --> 46:34.240
- It was the donkey.
- Who owns that?

46:34.320 --> 46:35.685
Oh, boy.

46:36.360 --> 46:37.880
We stopped him!

46:37.960 --> 46:39.480
That went great, right?

46:39.560 --> 46:41.290
Hey, you big mutts!

46:41.600 --> 46:43.880
- Come here.
- Hope your boss knows how to swim.

46:43.960 --> 46:45.325
You want some of this?

46:46.840 --> 46:48.808
What's the matter, guys? All tied up?

46:51.800 --> 46:53.211
That's it, you're dead.

46:55.280 --> 46:56.805
Thank you. Thank you very much.

46:57.480 --> 47:01.485
- I hate that dancing bird.
- I know. He's so talented.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.444
- Joseph.
- No, no.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.967
I do not want that donkey
near you or the baby.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.203
Go! Get out of here!

47:20.600 --> 47:22.680
- Joseph, it's fine.
- Fine?

47:22.760 --> 47:25.040
Mary, this is not going well, all right?

47:25.120 --> 47:28.880
I just promised four people
I'd repair the carts that he smashed.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.849
Yeah, trying to save her life.

47:31.040 --> 47:34.203
Maybe if you pulled the cart,
Joseph would want you to stay.

47:34.360 --> 47:37.160
- No, he is just too much to deal with.
- He's just a donkey.

47:37.240 --> 47:40.760
"Just a donkey?" Yeah, he is.
Just a good-for-nothing donkey

47:40.840 --> 47:43.161
that has only ever brought us trouble.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.920
Come on, Dave. Let's go.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.400
- Where are we going?
- Where do you think?

47:51.480 --> 47:53.120
To join the royal caravan.

47:53.200 --> 47:56.090
Where we'll finally do something important.

48:00.520 --> 48:04.160
Bo, wait a minute. What about the star?

48:04.240 --> 48:06.720
It means something. You said so yourself.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.803
You follow the star. I'm done with that.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.085
But what about our tiny flock?

48:12.560 --> 48:14.369
Flocks stick together.

48:14.880 --> 48:16.245
We're not a flock.

48:16.680 --> 48:18.410
I never should have followed you.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.851
Bo?

48:35.280 --> 48:36.805
Bo!

49:05.040 --> 49:06.770
We're gonna die. We're gonna die!

49:08.560 --> 49:10.528
We're gonna live. We're gonna live!

49:13.080 --> 49:15.083
Someone's gonna die.

49:23.320 --> 49:29.441
<i>Why should I feel discouraged?</i>

49:31.280 --> 49:36.491
<i>Why should the shadows come?</i>

49:39.080 --> 49:45.008
<i>Why should my heart be lonely?</i>

49:46.760 --> 49:52.529
<i>And long for Heaven and home?</i>

49:54.360 --> 50:01.050
<i>I sing because I'm happy</i>

50:02.320 --> 50:08.851
<i>I sing because I'm free</i>

50:10.280 --> 50:15.491
<i>His eye is on the sparrow</i>

50:17.760 --> 50:23.847
<i>And I know He watches me.</i>

50:33.480 --> 50:34.925
Is that the royal caravan?

50:35.040 --> 50:36.371
I can see them!

51:03.760 --> 51:06.161
Royal caravan-van-van-van-van!

51:06.320 --> 51:08.766
The royal caravan!

51:09.720 --> 51:11.085
Dave?

51:11.600 --> 51:13.523
I don't think I can go with you.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.320
Of course you can. What do you mean?

51:16.400 --> 51:18.004
Look...

51:18.160 --> 51:22.240
I know we've always talked about
joining the royal caravan,

51:22.320 --> 51:24.163
being a part of something important,

51:24.320 --> 51:28.405
but now that we're here,
I don't think this is it.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.880
You know, Mary may not be big and royal,

51:31.960 --> 51:33.883
but she's important.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.731
She's important to me.

51:36.040 --> 51:37.565
I know this was our dream,

51:37.720 --> 51:41.008
and even though I can't come,
I think you should go.

51:42.320 --> 51:43.845
Say hi to the horses for me.

51:45.840 --> 51:47.840
- Come on.
- No, really, I mean it.

51:47.920 --> 51:49.604
Bo, yes, you're right.

51:49.880 --> 51:51.723
The royal caravan was our dream.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.130
But the best part
was that it was gonna be us.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.600
If all I wanted was to flap
around a bunch of fancy wagons,

51:58.680 --> 52:00.489
I could have gone and done that
a long time ago.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.810
I mean, I can fly, you know?
You realize that?

52:04.240 --> 52:06.129
Yeah. I guess so.

52:06.560 --> 52:09.080
Look, you lead the way, and wherever you go,

52:09.160 --> 52:12.005
your best friend Dave
will be right behind you.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.245
You ready?

52:36.480 --> 52:39.131
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Let me help.

52:39.240 --> 52:42.528
- Mary, you're in no condition to help.
- Stop saying that.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.680
- I'm fine.
- No, you are not fine.

52:44.760 --> 52:48.080
- None of this is fine.
- Joseph, God chose us.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.200
But why? Why us?

52:50.280 --> 52:53.204
Look at us. We'll be lucky
just to make it to Bethlehem.

52:53.320 --> 52:56.449
And we're supposed to raise the Son of God?

52:58.200 --> 53:00.320
This must be part of God's plan.

53:00.400 --> 53:02.687
Well, so far, this plan is going great.

53:02.800 --> 53:04.723
I can't wait to see what happens next.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.921
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

53:11.280 --> 53:16.491
<i>That your baby boy
will one day walk on water?</i>

53:16.640 --> 53:18.160
What are you looking at?

53:18.240 --> 53:20.163
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

53:20.600 --> 53:27.085
<i>That your baby boy
will save our sons and daughters?</i>

53:27.680 --> 53:29.330
Lord, I can't do this.

53:30.240 --> 53:32.080
All right? I am not the father of a king.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.766
I'm just a carpenter. Please, give me a sign.

53:37.480 --> 53:44.409
<i>This child that you delivered
will soon deliver you</i>

53:45.920 --> 53:47.763
Really?

53:48.520 --> 53:49.760
The donkey?

53:51.680 --> 53:53.808
Stop it.

53:56.560 --> 54:01.080
<i>Mary, did you know?</i>

54:01.160 --> 54:02.491
Mary?

54:07.560 --> 54:08.925
Hi, Ruth.

54:09.520 --> 54:11.800
Look, I'm sorry for what I said back there.

54:11.880 --> 54:13.723
It was mean, and...

54:14.280 --> 54:15.930
I'm glad we followed you.

54:17.520 --> 54:20.205
You know, that night I saw the star,

54:20.400 --> 54:23.000
I tried to get my old flock to follow me,

54:23.080 --> 54:24.680
but they wouldn't.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.331
And so I struck out on my own,

54:27.440 --> 54:31.240
which has been hard
'cause, well, I'm a sheep.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.129
Thank you for coming back.

54:36.120 --> 54:40.762
- Can you help me with these?
- Of course! You're back!

54:41.400 --> 54:44.802
- Sorry, personal space.
- Come here.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.001
Mary.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.282
Are you okay? I am so sorry.

54:57.240 --> 55:00.449
No, Joseph. You were right.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.082
I was? About what?

55:03.600 --> 55:04.761
This is hard.

55:05.560 --> 55:07.767
Trust me, I know it is.

55:08.800 --> 55:12.646
Just because God has a plan
doesn't mean it's going to be easy.

55:13.680 --> 55:15.523
And that scares me.

55:16.640 --> 55:18.370
I'm scared, too.

55:19.280 --> 55:21.965
But I'm here. And I am yours.

55:22.120 --> 55:24.362
And I will give everything that I have

55:24.880 --> 55:27.087
to keep you and the baby safe.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.446
I mean, I may not have a lot...

55:40.600 --> 55:43.365
Speaking of which,
what happened to all our stuff?

55:48.360 --> 55:50.363
- Bo!
- I always liked that donkey.

55:50.560 --> 55:53.291
I always did. I didn't say it enough.
That's true.

55:54.160 --> 55:56.640
- Hello.
- Did the baby kick?

55:56.760 --> 55:58.490
No, that was something different.

55:58.880 --> 56:01.451
Different? What "different?"
Like, baby's coming now?

56:02.120 --> 56:05.408
We've got some time, but, yeah, I think so.

56:05.760 --> 56:08.684
Okay! Nobody panic!
I've got the clothes. I've got the bag.

56:08.800 --> 56:11.007
I've got the sheep. Why do I have the sheep?

56:12.200 --> 56:14.646
Bo, can you carry her?

56:16.440 --> 56:20.331
<i>One dark night</i>

56:20.680 --> 56:24.207
<i>Something said follow the light</i>

56:24.600 --> 56:28.400
<i>So you look up and see the word</i>

56:28.520 --> 56:32.366
<i>That's written upon the sky</i>

56:32.720 --> 56:36.611
<i>Strong and wise</i>

56:36.920 --> 56:40.607
<i>Keeping the Lord as your guide</i>

56:41.040 --> 56:44.886
<i>And through the doubt you realize</i>

56:45.160 --> 56:48.120
<i>He's with you all the while</i>

56:48.200 --> 56:52.171
<i>Follow that star above you</i>

56:52.640 --> 56:56.725
<i>Should the world try to break you down</i>

56:57.400 --> 57:00.643
<i>There is one who waits for you</i>

57:01.000 --> 57:04.368
<i>Though you can't see Him now</i>

57:04.480 --> 57:08.724
<i>Thunder and rain surround you</i>

57:08.920 --> 57:12.242
<i>But His love's just a breath away</i>

57:12.360 --> 57:16.520
<i>If you follow your heart, follow the light</i>

57:16.600 --> 57:20.730
<i>Follow that star</i>

57:24.400 --> 57:28.960
<i>If you follow your heart, follow the light</i>

57:29.040 --> 57:31.520
<i>Follow that star</i>

57:44.240 --> 57:47.642
<i>I have traveled</i>

57:48.520 --> 57:52.680
<i>Many moonless nights</i>

57:52.760 --> 57:56.367
<i>Cold and weary</i>

57:56.880 --> 58:01.360
<i>With a babe inside</i>

58:01.440 --> 58:03.760
<i>And I wonder</i>

58:03.840 --> 58:05.440
All right. Shall we?

58:05.520 --> 58:06.851
<i>What I've done</i>

58:11.440 --> 58:14.091
All right, buddy, just wait here,
and we'll be back out in a second.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.602
And they're inside.

58:17.920 --> 58:19.684
Thank goodness. This has been so stressful.

58:20.400 --> 58:21.840
I don't know how we held it together.

58:21.920 --> 58:23.240
Well, we made it.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.800
Safe and sound in Bethlehem.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.730
Something's not right.

58:32.400 --> 58:33.765
Excuse me.

58:37.040 --> 58:38.087
You.

58:38.200 --> 58:40.440
- No, no, no.
- Easy. Easy, boy.

58:40.520 --> 58:41.760
It's okay.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.280
Just hold still.

58:43.360 --> 58:45.080
Let me go!

58:45.160 --> 58:47.640
No, you don't,
crazy-eyed, donkey-eating miller.

58:47.720 --> 58:49.085
That's my best friend!

58:50.040 --> 58:51.246
- Move on!
- Dave!

58:51.600 --> 58:53.523
Dave, are you okay?

58:54.600 --> 58:56.603
Where did they go? Who was that?

58:56.720 --> 58:57.881
Bad news.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.440
- I'm sorry. The inn is full.
- What?

59:00.520 --> 59:02.680
But, no, can't you see
she's about to have a child?

59:02.760 --> 59:04.683
What can I do? Blame the census.

59:05.120 --> 59:07.240
You know what? We will pay double.

59:07.320 --> 59:08.760
Just hold that thought.

59:08.840 --> 59:10.046
I'll be right back.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.289
- I left the money with Bo.
- Joseph?

59:13.000 --> 59:14.240
Bo?

59:14.920 --> 59:16.160
Where's Bo?

59:18.640 --> 59:20.640
Joseph, we're running out of time!

59:20.720 --> 59:21.760
Mary.

59:21.840 --> 59:22.921
Bo...

59:23.120 --> 59:24.929
Bo, where are you?

59:25.040 --> 59:27.160
Ruth, I know we have had our personal issues,

59:27.240 --> 59:29.402
but we need to set them aside and find Bo.

59:29.760 --> 59:31.808
We have personal issues?

59:31.920 --> 59:34.241
Dave, I think you are a delight.

59:34.440 --> 59:37.040
I am a delight. Thank you for noticing.

59:37.120 --> 59:40.169
Okay, time to activate Operation Rescue Bo.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.006
She's here.

59:54.200 --> 59:55.840
Down the street. Try them.

59:55.920 --> 59:58.651
You don't understand.
We just came from there.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.646
Sorry.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.806
Where do we go now?

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.561
We will find a place.
We just have to keep looking.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:11.400
So this is Bethle-ham.

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.440
It is pronounced "Bethle-hem."

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.329
- That's what I said. "Bethle-ham."
- "Hem."

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.200
"Hem." As if you're clearing your throat.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.400
- Boys.
- That's what I've been saying.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:20.560
- You need to get your ears checked.
- Boys, focus.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.080
The new king's in danger.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.491
Right. Let's go find him.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.000
They've secured our restraints.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.400
Yeah, and they tied us up, too.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.120
We have to find the new king.

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.720
Wise men indeed.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.080
Okay, okay, think. What do kings look like?

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:35.880
In most cultures,
a king is set apart from the plebeians

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.480
with an ornamental headdress.

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:38.680
A ornamel what?

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.091
They wear hats.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.240
They're coming for you, Your Majesty!

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.811
Run for your life!

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.600
- Run like the wind!
- Will you cut that out?

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.120
We'll never find him tied up here.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.040
- We have to go out and search.
- That's it.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.640
I'm biting through the reins.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.721
Don't you dare.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.640
That is fine Corinthian leather.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.688
Do you have any idea how much that cost?

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.484
- You kidding me?
- No, he's right.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.240
Well, we'll have to untie
these knots ourselves.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.440
Just follow my instructions.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:08.200
First, Felix, we'll need you in the middle.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:09.805
Deborah, on the left.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.280
- Excuse me. Pardon me.
- No.

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.560
- Let me... Move.
- No. Over.

01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:14.920
- Would you move?
- The other way.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.400
- Sorry about that. Sorry. My bad.
- I got it.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480
- Move.
- No, around.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.687
No, the other...

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.960
- The other left.
- Stop!

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.371
Would you stop pinching me?

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.364
Come on. Come on.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.208
No, no, no. Don't do this. Please!

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.685
I can't let them down.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.962
I could try praying.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.247
Let's see...

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.050
Okay, how did Mary do this?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:47.961
Never mind.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.327
It's fine.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.523
God? Hello?

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.600
I don't really know how this works

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.480
or if You listen to prayers from donkeys,

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.120
but I've seen Mary do this many times,

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.487
and I don't know what else to do.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.251
My friends need help.

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.045
I thought, if I followed the star,

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.322
it would lead me to where I'm supposed to be,

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.891
but I failed them.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.010
What do you want me to do?

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.441
Begone! Away with you!

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:22.446
- God?
- Now it's talking back.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.920
There's nothing to fear, Zach.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.520
It's all a figment of your imagination.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.360
This really realistic vision
of a donkey who's talking to God

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.522
- and won't stop eyeballing you.
- Zach.

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.765
Pull yourself together.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.406
What's your name, sweetie?

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.200
Bo.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.040
Bo is a funny word.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:39.440
Bo, Bo, Bo.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.960
- Bo, Bo.
- What?

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.040
- Bo, Bo!
- He has a name?

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.040
- And she's singing him a song?
- I'm doomed.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:45.560
- Bo!
- I kind of like that.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.040
They're not usually like this.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.611
You caught us at a bad time.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.680
We haven't slept in nine months.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.603
- Nine months?
- Not a wink.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.680
So that explains your eyes.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.649
What? What's wrong with my eyes?

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.366
Nothing.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.360
Yep, no sleep at all

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.966
since that giant night light turned on.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.520
- Light?
- All you can do

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.126
is lie awake and listen to the crickets.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.726
Ta-da.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.800
Sorry. So excited.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:21.080
Zach and Edith don't like the spotlight,

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.208
but I think it's beautiful.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.607
It's here.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.125
I can't believe this.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240
- Me, neither.
- You don't understand.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.084
That light, that's the star.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.282
This is where it's been leading me.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.880
But Mary... Joseph...

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.610
Guys, I gotta get out of here.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.287
- Can you help me?
- I got you. I'm gonna chew him free.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.243
- Woody.
- No. Try biting the...

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.164
I know! I'll sing you free.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.600
That was beautiful, but not helpful.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.603
I think I got a splinter in my tongue.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.646
Step aside.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.284
Yes, yes! That's perfect.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.168
Now I just gotta get past that gate.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.160
Has that ever worked for you?

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.651
No, actually.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.170
Come on. Up you go.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:27.800
Thanks, guys.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.647
Gotta run. Mary's having a baby!

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.680
- A baby?
- I love babies.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.360
Bring 'em back here.
There's plenty of room in the stable.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.841
Great. Now we'll never sleep.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.880
What?

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.485
No, no, no, no.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.680
Bo, buddy, where are you?

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.808
Bo, are you there?

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.721
Bo? Bo!

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.803
Bo! Hey, Bo.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.201
Bo!

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.080
- Ruth.
- You're here.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.840
- Dave.
- We've gotta help Mary and Joseph.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.000
I know. Where are they?

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:01.889
Yeah, we hadn't gotten that far.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.487
The dogs are here.
We can't take them on our own.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.640
We need to find help.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.962
- You can count on us!
- We won't let you down!

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.010
They went that way.

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.560
What are we doing? We're not gonna
stop those giant, scary dogs

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.160
with a fluffy sheep and a tiny donkey.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.208
Even with a very masculine and brave dove.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.760
We need backup.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.491
Where do you find a dog-eating
hippopotamus in Bethlehem?

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.962
A three-headed camel? Nice.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.804
Help! Help!

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.850
Help! Anybody!

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.571
Look, a flock of sheep.

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.243
That kind of looks like my...

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.124
That's my flock.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.960
Help.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.963
Is there anybody else?

01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.808
No? Okay.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.040
Bo needs my help.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.963
Okay, you can do this. Here we go.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.363
Hey, everybody.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.720
What's up?

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.930
It's me, Ruth.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.165
Okay.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:17.600
I know you guys think I was crazy
to leave and follow the star,

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:21.120
but you wouldn't believe
all the adventures I've had out there.

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.600
And the biggest one of all
is happening tonight.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.280
I've made new friends,
and they need our help.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:29.125
So, this time, you gotta follow me.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.931
Guys?

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.284
This is important!

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:46.961
Fear not.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.680
I bring good tidings of great joy.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:52.570
For unto you is born this day a savior,

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.445
Christ, the Lord.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.882
Told ya it was important.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.322
I'm sorry. There's no room.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.961
Sorry.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.207
I'm sorry.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.166
Joseph, I can't go any further.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.444
All right, all right, Mary, here.

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.645
Just...

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:15.691
Here. Lay here.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.960
Mary? Mary, look at me.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:21.880
You're doing great.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.280
Remember, God chose us for a reason.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:25.930
This must be part of His plan.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.730
Help us. Help us.

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.851
Please, God, help us.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.283
Mary! Joseph!

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.045
Not good.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.208
No, no, no, no, that's not good at all.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.763
- Bo?
- Bo? You're back!

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.162
Buddy, we need somewhere to go.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.970
Mary, let's go.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.210
Guys, guys.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.640
- I found them.
- We're all set.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.041
It's not much, but there's plenty of light.

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:07.439
No, no, no, this isn't gonna work.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.966
We can't have the baby here.
Mary, we need stronger bedding.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.764
- You know, we need warmer...
- Joseph.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.251
It's time.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.240
Thank you.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:39.203
Well, well...

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:40.970
Look who it is.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:43.560
We should've eaten him
the first time we met him.

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.041
But, Rufus, if we had eaten him,

01:09:46.439 --> 01:09:48.647
he would never have led us here.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.048
We've been meaning to thank you.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.403
Now, be a good little donkey and run along.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.728
You've served your purpose.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.920
You guys are pretty scary.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.120
Yeah. And you might be stronger than I am.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.760
But if you wanna get to my friends,

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.127
you're gonna have to get past me first.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.601
No problem, donkey!

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:08.882
Getting past you is my middle name.

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.560
What is that?

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.080
What's what? I wasn't
supposed to look, was I?

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:15.605
Donkey kick!

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.728
You just made a big mistake.

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.931
You're mine!

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.923
Not gonna let you do this!

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.365
No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.526
No. Mary! Joseph!

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:13.520
Mary.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.931
I'm sorry.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.049
For the flock!

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.084
Coming at you, bro!

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.522
- I don't wanna die!
- Somebody, help.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.165
It's just another cliff.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.481
Grab hold of this.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:08.246
Come on.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.691
Bo?

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.487
Bo, you're doing it.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.800
Excellent climbing form, Bo.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.450
Be the wedge.

01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.490
We're bad dogs.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.891
You don't have to be.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.045
You're free now.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.000
Bo, where are you going?

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.440
We've got a baby to meet.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:26.726
Come on.

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.880
After all that, it is a baby shower.

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.644
You were right the whole time.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.880
You had it right as well.
It is a birthday party.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.486
Literally, it's the day of his birth.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.489
I'm gonna let 'em have this one.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.367
<i>Holy</i>

01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:02.520
<i>Holy</i>

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.687
<i>O holy night</i>

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:13.120
<i>The stars are brightly shining</i>

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.880
<i>It is the night</i>

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.603
<i>Of our dear Savior's birth</i>

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.245
<i>Long lay the world</i>

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.328
<i>In sin and error pining...</i>

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.971
Hey, little guy.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.285
It's okay, Bo.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.369
<i>A thrill of hope</i>

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.320
<i>The weary world rejoices</i>

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.960
Everybody, everybody, listen up.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.960
There's this huge guy with two dogs
coming after Mary,

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.202
and if we don't do something now,
then the baby's not gonna...

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.720
Looks like...

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.200
Looks like you guys handled it.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.361
Sweet.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.446
This seat taken?

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:10.846
Everyone,

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:12.605
this is Mary and Joseph.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.211
And that's their new baby.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.251
The flock is growing.

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.046
No. Not happening. Don't even think about it.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.203
It's okay. Let them in.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.404
Look with your eyes.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.920
See?

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.411
He's just a baby.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.760
Look at him.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.491
Thaddeus, are we good dogs now?

01:15:57.960 --> 01:15:59.769
We have to try.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.561
Is...

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:19.040
I'm sorry. Is this your stable?

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.320
No, no, no.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.687
We've come to honor the new king.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200
I'm sorry.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.089
King? Where? What...

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.091
What is he talking about? A king?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.286
What's his name?

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.484
His name is Jesus.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.043
For Jesus, gold.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:37.926
Myrrh.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.889
Do you guys like frankincense?

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.771
I never know what to get.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.087
Thank you.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.920
For the newborn king.

<i>For yonder breaks</i>

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.000
<i>A new and glorious morn</i>

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.160
<i>Fall on your knees</i>

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.920
Guys, I carried a king on my back.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
We're never gonna hear
the end of this, are we?

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.287
And I hope we never do.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.606
You know, I think people
are gonna remember this night.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.080
What happened here around this manger

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.720
will be celebrated for thousands of years.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:29.560
Families will come together
and exchange presents and sing carols.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.680
All to remember the grace of this moment
that we are witnessing right now.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.882
- Okay, Deborah.
- She's back to talking crazy again.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.767
Hey. It's okay.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.087
