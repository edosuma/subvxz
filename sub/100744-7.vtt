00:11.200 --> 00:13.160
<i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:13.600 --> 00:15.600
<i>After the battle at Tettenhall,</i>

00:16.040 --> 00:18.480
<i>Brida has been captured and enslaved</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:20.040
<i>-in Wealas.</i>
-[screams, grunts]

00:20.120 --> 00:23.640
<i>Aethelred's death has left Mercia</i>
<i>with an empty throne</i>

00:24.080 --> 00:25.960
<i>and many vying for influence.</i>

00:26.040 --> 00:28.520
As you know, Lady Aelfwynn is dear to me.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.440
I should like her to be betrothed
to a man I trust.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.640
Could you be such a man, Eardwulf?

00:33.720 --> 00:38.440
[Uhtred] <i>With Aelfwynn's hand in marriage,</i>
<i>Eardwulf was to become ruler of Mercia.</i>

00:38.520 --> 00:42.880
They cast me aside,
treat my child as a bag of silver.

00:42.960 --> 00:47.400
<i>But I was compelled to disrupt their plans</i>
<i>and took Aelfwynn into hiding.</i>

00:47.480 --> 00:49.280
[Eardwulf]
Find me 12 men to leave immediately.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.440
If Wessex is incapable,
we'll find the fugitives ourselves.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.920
<i>Rumors of fever break out in the land...</i>

00:55.000 --> 00:57.720
-[splutters]
<i>-...bringing fear and desperation.</i>

00:57.800 --> 00:59.560
People are abandoning their villages.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.000
[Ludeca]
<i>It ravages worse than any Dane invader.</i>

01:02.360 --> 01:07.000
Two of my grandchildren
travel on open ground in time of sickness.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.239
[Uhtred] <i>Eadith betrayed her brother</i>
<i>to protect Lady Aelfwynn.</i>

01:10.319 --> 01:12.880
He murdered Lord Aethelred!
I witnessed it!

01:12.960 --> 01:16.680
<i>But she has been struck by illness</i>
<i>and may not survive.</i>

01:16.760 --> 01:18.160
I fear she's getting worse.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.800
<i>We must return to Aegelesburg,</i>
<i>reveal Eardwulf's treachery.</i>

01:21.880 --> 01:24.200
And we tell him what kind of a man
he trusted.

01:24.280 --> 01:29.320
<i>A new ruler must be found to bring peace,</i>
<i>or all will be lost.</i>

01:29.920 --> 01:31.160
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:31.440 --> 01:34.360
[intense vocalizing]

02:14.800 --> 02:18.840
[priest] <i>In nomine Patris, et Filii,</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti...</i>

02:20.320 --> 02:24.200
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filii,</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti...</i>

02:24.960 --> 02:26.720
[somber vocalizing]

02:26.800 --> 02:28.240
<i>In nomine Patris...</i>

02:43.680 --> 02:45.880
[crowd murmuring]

02:45.960 --> 02:46.840
[spits]

02:48.000 --> 02:51.120
-Ignore it.
-Such disrespect.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.360
I wasn't fond of Aethelred,
but he was Lord here.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.400
A curse upon the line of Aethelred!

03:10.000 --> 03:10.960
[whispers] Quickly!

03:18.960 --> 03:21.600
-You will get me executed.
-You've survived so far.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.200
Can you hide them? She's my daughter.
And he's the King's bastard.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.320
-What?
-Do not ask.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.200
It is just until I can get Edward
to listen.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.920
I fear we are beyond that. This place
is like a tinder waiting for a spark.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.480
-Which is why I need you to help me.
-[Pyrlig panting]

03:35.560 --> 03:36.400
Thank you.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.960
Come on, this way.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.000
[somber vocalizing]

03:42.080 --> 03:44.160
[woman] Curse upon the line of Aethelred!

03:45.160 --> 03:47.280
Is this defiance caused by hunger?

03:48.200 --> 03:52.240
-Hunger, fever, a lack of leadership.
-[crowd shouting]

03:52.320 --> 03:53.800
How long will the grain last?

03:54.800 --> 03:58.240
That depends on how much the Ealdormen
have kept for themselves.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.200
[man] May God forgive you!

04:04.640 --> 04:08.080
Lord Burgred speaks against me yet again.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.560
Ignore the chatter.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.920
Truly dangerous men do not issue threats.

04:20.280 --> 04:21.360
Look at them.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.720
I know that look. You have no plan.

04:28.160 --> 04:29.040
I have a plan.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.600
[woman] Shame on you!

04:31.880 --> 04:34.080
We tell the Ealdorman
we'll kill their lord.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.160
[Finan scoffs]

04:36.920 --> 04:38.480
Forgive me, but there is news.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.560
The Ealdormen have called their Witan
for after the funeral.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.600
Why was I not informed?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.920
They say you do not need to know
and that you may not enter the Witan.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.360
[priest] <i>Pater noster qui es in caelis.</i>

04:56.600 --> 04:58.440
May your name be hallowed.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.120
May your will be done...

05:02.480 --> 05:03.840
What has happened here?

05:06.120 --> 05:11.640
-Slaughter, betrayal and now ambition.
-[Finan] So, when they come to kill you,

05:11.720 --> 05:14.400
-what would you like me to do?
-They will not kill me.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.440
I am the only one who knows
where Aelfwynn hides.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.880
We will strike a deal.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.480
-[Witan clamoring]
-The King cannot be trusted.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.560
He calls himself leader of all Saxons,

05:24.640 --> 05:27.280
yet he-he schemes against us
to make us submissive!

05:27.360 --> 05:29.120
We will ask him to explain himself.

05:29.200 --> 05:32.200
So he can lie about Lady Aelfwynn,
as he lied about her mother?

05:32.280 --> 05:36.080
-The time has come to take a bolder step!
-Isolating ourselves from Wessex

05:36.160 --> 05:38.920
would serve Mercia no better
than King Edward's tyranny!

05:39.000 --> 05:42.400
-Then let us put it to the Witan!
-Who would...

05:42.760 --> 05:44.360
[clamoring stops]

05:48.200 --> 05:49.640
Please, continue.

05:51.360 --> 05:56.080
-The Witan is closed to all but Mercians.
-I am Mercian in blood through my mother.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.320
Lord, no. We must be able to speak freely.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.800
I do not deny that.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.240
[Witan murmuring]

06:07.640 --> 06:10.960
Speak. I come merely to listen
to your discussions.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.520
You were saying I lied
about Lady Aelfwynn?

06:14.800 --> 06:17.680
Everyone knows
Eardwulf hunts her on the road.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.880
[Edward] Yes, to bring her here to safety.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.640
We are waiting until the sickness passes
and Eardwulf and Lady Aelfwynn return.

06:23.720 --> 06:24.560
Lies!

06:24.640 --> 06:25.640
[indistinct chatter]

06:25.720 --> 06:28.800
That seems an unwise thing to say.

06:28.880 --> 06:34.720
You said we could speak freely
and I say this is lies!

06:34.800 --> 06:35.720
[Witan shouting]

06:35.800 --> 06:37.920
Lord Burgred, remember who I am.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.840
You move in your troops,
leader of the Mercian Guard disappears,

06:42.920 --> 06:45.800
so yet again we cannot defend ourselves.

06:45.880 --> 06:50.000
Then suddenly, from nowhere,
a fever closes the city

06:50.080 --> 06:52.640
-and starves the people!
-Burgred! You go too far!

06:52.720 --> 06:55.600
You cannot be suggesting
I created this situation.

06:55.680 --> 06:59.520
The people are hungry
because you hoard the grain!

06:59.600 --> 07:02.800
We hoard it
so it cannot fatten Wessex fighters.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.400
-Enough! Enough!
-[Witan murmuring]

07:05.480 --> 07:07.080
-The outlaw returns!
-No outlaw.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.400
Just a man who's seen enough conflict
in Mercia. Let me speak.

07:12.880 --> 07:15.440
I am Lord Uhtred,
who, with Lady Aethelflaed,

07:15.520 --> 07:19.080
has led Mercian fyrds to victory
against the Danes at Tettenhall.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.600
I spilled blood for you.
I ask that you listen to me in return.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.880
Lord Uhtred, explain to these people

07:24.960 --> 07:27.920
Lady Aelfwynn is safe
and about to return for her betrothal.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.080
She is safe, but she cannot be betrothed.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.000
Eardwulf has confessed to the murder
of Lord Aethelred

07:35.080 --> 07:36.880
-and he has fled Mercia.
-[murmuring]

07:36.960 --> 07:39.400
Ignore the heathen!
He's just a troublemaker!

07:39.480 --> 07:43.080
Why do you seek to humiliate Mercia
with these outrageous lies?

07:43.160 --> 07:46.200
It is no lie. Eardwulf has near
confessed it before his men.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.280
This was found on him.

07:49.960 --> 07:53.160
It belonged to Lord Aethelred
and was stolen from his dying hand.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.960
Eardwulf has done many things
to harm Mercia.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.240
You all chose to turn your eyes from it.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.840
This is the consequence.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.720
[indistinct chatter]

08:30.600 --> 08:31.440
What is it?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.640
-I'm not going to tell you.
-Is it wormwood?

08:37.760 --> 08:40.919
It will not work. I've heard it kills men.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.799
Poison can sometimes be a cure.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.600
Mixed with holy water,
it will cool the fever.

08:46.559 --> 08:48.760
Look at her. She is dying.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.880
-If she does, we will be blamed.
-There's sickness everywhere, Eadith.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.080
Yes, and who gets accused?
Sinners, people like me.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.600
You have not been shunned as I have.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.480
-I will not take the risk.
-[scoffs]

09:03.200 --> 09:05.920
And I thought you were amongst
the bravest of warriors.

09:14.000 --> 09:14.840
There.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.480
Now she and I are both<i> </i>doomed.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.320
[Aelfwynn breathing heavily]

09:22.400 --> 09:23.240
Aelfwynn?

09:27.560 --> 09:28.600
[sighs]

09:32.240 --> 09:35.440
-[Aelfwynn coughing]
-[Edward]<i> Where is my niece, Uhtred?</i>

09:35.800 --> 09:38.600
We know you traveled the road
with children from Saltwic.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.240
-Where are they?
-I will not tell you.

09:44.280 --> 09:48.240
Not until I have your word that Aelfwynn
and Lady Aethelflaed will be protected.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.080
You are in no position to bargain!

09:50.160 --> 09:51.080
[Uhtred sighs]

09:51.160 --> 09:53.800
So, I will ask you this one more time.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.560
-Where is my niece?
-[sighs]

09:58.800 --> 10:01.360
Tell me or I shall have you seized.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.040
I've done nothing wrong. You know this.

10:04.120 --> 10:08.240
Your actions have caused chaos,
disturbed a smooth transition of power

10:08.320 --> 10:10.680
and launched an uprising
amongst the Ealdormen!

10:12.080 --> 10:15.320
So, even you will understand
why I call you traitor.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.000
Take him away.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.240
[scoffs]

10:29.160 --> 10:33.200
Find out where he hides her. The girl is
our only way to maintain the alliance.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.800
If we cannot betroth her,
we lose that bond.

10:36.560 --> 10:38.480
But who to betroth her to?

10:39.560 --> 10:42.280
You said there are no suitable candidates.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.480
[breathes deeply] Yes.

10:44.920 --> 10:48.160
Perhaps instead of seeking
to make a bond with the Ealdormen...

10:49.480 --> 10:51.240
we should find a way to break them.

10:55.360 --> 10:58.560
-[bleating]
-[Rhodri] <i>Why haven't we slaughtered them?</i>

10:58.640 --> 11:01.320
-[guard] We were tricked!
-You say you have them under control,

11:01.400 --> 11:03.760
and then I hear they've taken
our villages to the south!

11:03.840 --> 11:05.400
I've never seen men like this before.

11:05.480 --> 11:09.480
I do not want this news to reach
my brother whilst he's on holy pilgrimage.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.360
-You will tell no one of these defeats.
-They are terrifying.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.320
[chuckles]

11:16.160 --> 11:17.000
What was that?

11:17.400 --> 11:18.640
Huh? Uh...

11:20.400 --> 11:21.640
Are you thirsty?

11:36.040 --> 11:38.240
-[Rhodri laughs]
-[Brida groans]

11:43.880 --> 11:46.840
[panting]

11:48.240 --> 11:49.080
[yells]

11:50.840 --> 11:52.800
[Burgred] Stay back! Come on, move aside.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.640
We are taking it to storage,
so that Wessex cannot steal it.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.040
[Cenric] Seize the carts!

11:58.120 --> 12:01.400
The King demands the grain
be shared fairly amongst the people.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.720
The King does not care for the people.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.160
Mm...

12:05.240 --> 12:07.120
[both grunting]

12:08.960 --> 12:09.880
Guards!

12:11.080 --> 12:12.880
-Stand aside!
-[woman groans]

12:20.800 --> 12:21.640
With me!

12:22.560 --> 12:24.440
[indistinct chatter]

12:27.320 --> 12:29.360
I would call this provocation.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.480
[horse neighs in distance]

12:41.000 --> 12:42.080
[Aldhelm] What is it?

12:42.160 --> 12:44.320
We're being followed. Come on!

12:44.400 --> 12:45.240
[Aldhelm] Go!

12:46.800 --> 12:48.920
[suspenseful music plays]

13:01.480 --> 13:03.600
-[whinnies]
-Could we have been discovered?

13:03.680 --> 13:06.040
-[Aldhelm] We cannot outrun them.
-[both panting]

13:06.120 --> 13:08.680
We must hide. Hyah! Away!

13:32.120 --> 13:33.000
Lord King!

13:33.080 --> 13:36.920
Why do you continue to impound our grain
and occupy our citadel?

13:37.000 --> 13:41.880
May I remind you, this hall is only
for the Lord of Mercia and his Ealdormen!

13:41.960 --> 13:44.920
And so I shall remain here
until the new Lord is chosen.

13:45.280 --> 13:49.280
Yet the Witan are minded
to separate from Wessex.

13:49.360 --> 13:50.200
Really?

13:55.560 --> 13:58.240
You do not speak for the Ealdormen.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.760
You are merely grasping
like a greedy child,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.360
and I shall not indulge it.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.360
If you want me to leave the hall,

14:04.880 --> 14:09.320
one of your men will have to lay hands
on a King,

14:09.640 --> 14:15.160
a man anointed by God to rule in his name
and a son of Alfred.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.720
They dishonor me,

14:18.320 --> 14:22.560
you dishonor Mercia for breaking
the accord so long held between us.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.440
Who will be the man to do it?

14:26.960 --> 14:29.360
Drag a King through the hall?

14:29.440 --> 14:33.240
Who dares throw himself
before God like this?

14:38.120 --> 14:39.000
[Burgred] I will.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.600
I will fight for Mercia.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.240
You forget I am King
and wield power like a King.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.120
Lord Burgred...

14:59.000 --> 15:02.440
we have taken your son to Wessex
for religious instruction.

15:03.680 --> 15:04.680
[horse snorts]

15:07.600 --> 15:11.720
[Edward] <i>He will be cared for</i>
<i>until his father finds better judgment.</i>

15:21.800 --> 15:24.760
[suspenseful music plays]

15:24.840 --> 15:27.240
[breathing heavily]

15:37.040 --> 15:38.720
-[Sihtric] Lady Aethelflaed.
-Run.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.920
-We know you're there!
-I'll hold them off.

15:41.000 --> 15:41.840
No, no!

15:48.400 --> 15:49.240
Sihtric!

15:50.760 --> 15:51.600
[sighs]

15:52.360 --> 15:53.720
Lady, it's Uhtred's men!

15:53.800 --> 15:55.200
[breathing heavily]

15:56.720 --> 15:58.600
-[Aldhelm] Thank God it's you.
-My lady.

15:59.560 --> 16:00.400
Aldhelm.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.640
You are not easy to find.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.000
Did Uhtred send you?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.400
What news of my daughter?

16:08.160 --> 16:11.160
She is safe.
Uhtred has returned to Aegelesburg

16:11.240 --> 16:14.240
-to bargain for your protection.
-Is Aelfwynn with him?

16:18.360 --> 16:21.920
She is being cared for,
but... she became unwell.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.000
-The sickness?
-[Young Uhtred] It may not be.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.520
She's traveled a great distance.

16:29.000 --> 16:29.840
Take me to her.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.480
Did the King ask you to do this?

16:40.760 --> 16:41.720
Do not speak.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.560
Were you sworn to Alfred?
Where will we have met?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.600
We have fought at Beamfleot.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.920
Must we extract this information
from you the hard way?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.319
[Aethelhelm sighs]

17:16.560 --> 17:20.960
Can't you just tell us
where Lady Aelfwynn is hiding?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.160
It's your choice.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.880
[both grunting]

17:57.680 --> 17:59.320
[grunting continues]

18:23.600 --> 18:24.440
Aelfwynn?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.520
[panting] Aelfwynn?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.040
[Aelfwynn wheezes]

18:28.120 --> 18:30.520
Aelfwynn, please wake up. Aelfwynn...

18:30.600 --> 18:31.560
You've killed her.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.120
No. Perhaps it is the poison
burning the fever in her body?

18:35.200 --> 18:38.360
-Or perhaps she's dead!
-No. No, she's still breathing.

18:41.360 --> 18:45.840
We must take her to a place of-of comfort.
Let us go back to Aegelesburg.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.280
-No, but Lord Uhtred said--
-I know what Uhtred said.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.200
But Uhtred is not my master
and we cannot stay here.

18:52.760 --> 18:56.280
We must get her to a healer in Aegelesburg
if she is to stand a chance.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.240
[quietly] Okay.

19:00.080 --> 19:00.920
[sniffles]

19:01.000 --> 19:05.560
[Osferth exhaling] Lord have mercy on us.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.040
How are your expressions of piety?

19:29.320 --> 19:30.440
Full-hearted.

19:32.120 --> 19:33.880
Where is Burgred's son?

19:34.520 --> 19:35.440
He is safe.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.200
It was a callous decision,
but I suspect a clever one.

19:42.240 --> 19:45.400
It has diminished Burgred
and you have averted a fight.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.240
For that, I am grateful.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.040
I do not think the conflict is over.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.920
But you've been decisive,
and that will help in times of chaos.

19:56.040 --> 20:00.280
Now you could play peacemaker yourself.
How will you proceed?

20:00.360 --> 20:03.240
I will not tell you,
for you will not keep it to yourself.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.640
Then I will tell you one thing.

20:07.400 --> 20:11.520
The people of Mercia are Saxon,
but they will never be of Wessex.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.560
Force them to be,
and they will fight back.

20:14.960 --> 20:18.560
If you do not seek to conquer,
all will be resolved.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.920
Continue to care for Mercia,

20:21.400 --> 20:25.440
find the right match for my granddaughter,
and peace will come.

20:26.400 --> 20:30.960
Did we discover if Uhtred
has all the children from Saltwic?

20:31.040 --> 20:33.360
He will not give us that information.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.960
Believe me, we tried to extract it.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.400
[groaning]

21:09.600 --> 21:13.840
Don't turn away from me.
This was done in your name.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.920
I did not order this, Uhtred.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.840
[groans]

21:24.200 --> 21:26.400
Aethelhelm claims he acts for you.

21:29.040 --> 21:29.880
Look at me!

21:45.880 --> 21:48.400
Fetch him food and water
and furs to keep him warm.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.320
Yes, Lord.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.600
[Edward] I did not order this,
because I knew it would not work.

21:56.080 --> 21:56.920
[Uhtred groans]

21:57.000 --> 22:00.440
Lord Aethelhelm was foolish
to think you would weaken.

22:02.040 --> 22:02.880
[chuckles]

22:08.080 --> 22:12.560
Tell me, where does it come from,
this courage?

22:14.120 --> 22:18.240
You have suffered greatly, and for what?
A child you barely know?

22:18.320 --> 22:19.440
Not for her.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.160
Then why?

22:21.240 --> 22:23.600
The same reason I fought at Tettenhall.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.280
My deep love of Mercian politics.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.920
You love my sister.

22:38.960 --> 22:42.760
Your sister is a widow.
She has my respect.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.640
I've always envied you
for choosing your own path.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.200
Looked at the way men followed you

22:56.280 --> 23:01.280
and felt... inspired,
if somewhat grudgingly.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.640
And now I wonder
if you are as imprisoned as I am...

23:08.600 --> 23:13.280
unable to escape a life
that was imposed upon you. [sighs]

23:13.360 --> 23:15.160
Neither of us asked to be here.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.720
For my part,
the choices are growing narrower.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.720
I have tried to find a solution here

23:22.800 --> 23:25.440
that respects the Mercians
and keeps order.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.600
But events have turned against me...

23:30.200 --> 23:35.040
and I have to ask myself,
does God want me to fight for this?

23:37.400 --> 23:39.760
I have followed the guidance of others
too long.

23:40.320 --> 23:42.600
I have made mistakes, yes.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.800
I have lived somewhat in Alfred's shadow.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.000
[inhales sharply]

23:53.280 --> 23:55.120
And now you see the light?

24:00.120 --> 24:04.360
I know he was speaking the truth when
he said the kingdoms are stronger united.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.080
So, perhaps I should be
unifying them myself...

24:12.480 --> 24:14.680
rather than making a child do it for me.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.480
You are free to go, Uhtred.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.640
[sighs] Return to Aelfwynn.

24:32.280 --> 24:37.280
Reunite with my sister and keep them safe
until the conflict passes.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.120
Matters may grow ugly here.
It is best they do not see it.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.840
[groans]

25:00.080 --> 25:03.960
[men laughing]

25:04.040 --> 25:06.120
[indistinct chatter]

25:08.880 --> 25:10.800
[man] You learn something every day...

25:10.880 --> 25:15.040
[Rhodri] They'll be pushed back to
the sea, drowning in their own blood!

25:15.400 --> 25:17.160
Picked on the wrong men this time!

25:19.400 --> 25:20.240
Hey!

25:21.400 --> 25:22.760
Did you hear that, bitch?

25:22.840 --> 25:24.920
-Do you want to congratulate us?
-[groans]

25:25.080 --> 25:28.560
Oh, she cannot speak for thirst.

25:29.240 --> 25:31.280
[Rhodri] Hey, want a drink?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.760
Come on. Come on.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.320
[men grunt]

25:37.400 --> 25:42.240
-[gasping]
-[men laughing]

25:42.920 --> 25:44.840
[whimpering]

25:45.480 --> 25:47.200
[men grunt and laugh]

25:47.280 --> 25:50.000
[hooves pattering]

25:59.280 --> 26:01.920
[dramatic vocalizing]

26:16.880 --> 26:18.000
[gasps]

26:19.800 --> 26:22.840
She says your daughter
passed into the next life.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.920
[breathes deeply]

26:25.320 --> 26:27.240
And her body was taken to Aegelesburg.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.680
[sniffles]

26:51.400 --> 26:55.880
Has Uhtred finally realized the stupidity
of his defiance?

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
I would say not.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.960
But I have asked him to leave Aegelesburg.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
-And I would like you to do the same.
-Lord?

27:04.080 --> 27:07.520
More than once
you have taken it upon yourself

27:07.600 --> 27:11.480
to interpret my wishes in a way
that I find unchristian.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.760
I have tried to guide you
on a bolder course.

27:14.840 --> 27:17.680
Is it boldness to confine a widow?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.880
Beat a man as he was chained?

27:19.960 --> 27:24.920
I simply placed myself between you
and some necessary unpleasantness.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.480
-I did what you asked.
-But not what I wanted.

27:28.400 --> 27:32.200
Once again, you used my orders
to suit your own wishes.

27:32.880 --> 27:37.120
Perhaps being so far from home
has clouded your judgment.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.840
Return to Winchester,
and all will be well.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.120
Very well, I shall do as you request.

27:46.280 --> 27:49.000
I hope your mother advises you better
than I have.

27:52.320 --> 27:56.680
Wonderful news, Edward! The word is that
Aelfwynn has been brought to the gates.

27:57.080 --> 27:57.960
She is here?

27:58.040 --> 28:00.760
-Shall I bring her into the town?
-Yes, of course! Bring her to me!

28:02.080 --> 28:02.960
Open the gate!

28:03.040 --> 28:07.160
See? It is a sign!
The Lord did not want you to be a tyrant

28:07.240 --> 28:08.800
and now has sent you your reward!

28:08.880 --> 28:11.640
-[guard] Move, move!
-[crowd clamoring]

28:15.200 --> 28:18.360
[Aelswith panting] Oh, dear God!
We will need a priest.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.680
We've tried everything.
She needs the final rites, Lord.

28:21.760 --> 28:25.280
Find me every healer in town.
Do not speak a word of this to anyone.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.720
Yes, Lord. Come with me.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.040
[Edward] Go.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.960
Do you think she will survive?

28:45.080 --> 28:47.160
[sighs] Dear God!

28:48.480 --> 28:50.040
I'll find the man who did this.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.480
[Uhtred sighs]

28:52.080 --> 28:54.080
Eh, don't, don't, don't.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.800
-[Uhtred sighs]
-What now?

28:57.800 --> 29:00.760
There's nothing for us here, Finan.
Where's my daughter?

29:00.840 --> 29:04.360
She's insisting on helping Father Pyrlig
and I've tried to dissuade her, but--

29:04.440 --> 29:07.240
She is too stubborn
because she is my daughter?

29:07.680 --> 29:09.000
-[both] Hm.
-[Finan scoffs]

29:09.400 --> 29:10.240
Where is she?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.560
[indistinct chatter]

29:26.600 --> 29:28.600
The King continues to take the town.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.200
He feeds the people.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.240
Truly, you have lost your judgment.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.480
Think on your son!

29:37.880 --> 29:39.800
-[man 1] There's grain!
-[man 2] Come with me.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.720
[woman] The cart's here!

29:42.840 --> 29:45.440
-Okay, there's plenty to go around.
-[Stiorra] Form a line.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.000
-[crowd clamoring]
-Don't push!

29:48.080 --> 29:50.560
[Stiorra] Here. [grunting]

29:51.200 --> 29:53.400
Stand back and form a line!

29:54.440 --> 29:56.480
-[man] You don't need it!
-Hold on!

29:56.560 --> 29:58.440
You would think the grain was silver.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.960
Hey, calm yourselves. Calm yourselves!
There's more than enough.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.600
-Stop this!
-[Pyrlig] Stand back!

30:04.680 --> 30:07.040
-[woman] Get off me!
-[Stiorra] Get off!

30:08.440 --> 30:10.600
[all grunting]

30:10.680 --> 30:11.840
[Uhtred] Stiorra!

30:11.920 --> 30:13.280
[grunting continues]

30:17.880 --> 30:20.680
-[Stiorra coughing]
-Finan, take Stiorra!

30:20.760 --> 30:24.160
-[Finan] Look at me. You're fine.
-[Uhtred] Stop! Drop it!

30:25.880 --> 30:28.120
-Enough! Get back!
-[man grunting]

30:31.160 --> 30:32.720
[Stiorra groaning]

30:35.080 --> 30:38.320
I know you suffer, but turning on
each other will not save you!

30:40.040 --> 30:44.040
You must work as one rather than
quarreling amongst yourselves.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.160
Now, get back behind the cart
and form a line.

30:47.240 --> 30:49.040
Each person will be given what they need.

30:49.360 --> 30:52.000
-Look how he influences them.
-[Uhtred] Trust me.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.360
-He will make them rise against you.
-[Uhtred] Mercian must not fight Mercian.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.520
Anyone who wants grain
must keep the peace.

31:00.800 --> 31:03.000
-Finan, help me with the bags.
-[Finan] Lord.

31:06.640 --> 31:07.840
Bring him before me.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.160
[Pyrlig] Bless you.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.600
[woman] Thank you. [grunts]

31:15.200 --> 31:17.720
[indistinct chatter]

31:24.880 --> 31:27.800
[groaning softly]

31:39.400 --> 31:42.200
[straining]

31:45.280 --> 31:47.520
[panting]

31:58.120 --> 32:00.920
[crowd yelling in distance]

32:03.720 --> 32:05.920
[yelling continues]

32:07.280 --> 32:09.800
Kill anyone who looks like
they cannot work!

32:10.240 --> 32:13.960
Fat ones we can sell as slaves. [roars]

32:15.200 --> 32:18.960
[yelling and grunting]

32:32.360 --> 32:34.080
Secure the fort!

32:36.640 --> 32:38.760
[screaming]

32:45.400 --> 32:47.760
[grunting]

32:49.600 --> 32:50.800
[leader] Spare him!

32:50.880 --> 32:53.960
[Rhodri panting] You want the silver?

32:55.920 --> 32:57.880
I have no interest in silver.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.680
We are looking for a Dane named Brida.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.920
Too late. I killed her.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.560
[Brida] You did not!

33:25.680 --> 33:26.640
[sighs]

33:33.920 --> 33:37.320
[Uhtred] Lord King,
I was leaving as we agreed.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.440
But then you chose to be part
of a disturbance in the town.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.840
I did not choose to be part of it.

33:43.600 --> 33:46.560
You were just guided by forces
beyond your control?

33:47.360 --> 33:49.960
As ever,
Uhtred is but a plaything of his gods.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.200
[Edward] You wanted to bring peace
to Aegelesburg.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.280
Which is better than wanting
to start another battle.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.920
You truly think I seek battles?

34:06.000 --> 34:10.040
Perhaps not, but that is what will happen.
The Ealdormen will not back down,

34:10.120 --> 34:13.239
so you will finish the slaughter
that the Danes have started.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.400
I fear you are right.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.520
There is a risk of great slaughter.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.080
Innocent people will suffer.

34:19.679 --> 34:23.199
I will crush them, leave the town
in the care of the Wessex Guard.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.600
They will run the place
as they feel they need to,

34:25.679 --> 34:28.000
which is rarely an easy life
for the people, is it?

34:29.360 --> 34:31.480
Strange things happen
in times of conflict.

34:32.280 --> 34:35.639
The Ealdormen are passionate
that they could repel us for a while.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.639
Whichever way,
the conflict would continue.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.440
They might try to hunt down my sister.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.159
They would not find her.

34:45.239 --> 34:48.520
So you will live as fugitives for months,
years? Is that how you see it?

34:48.600 --> 34:50.159
I've spent many years on the road.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.600
True, but it is not the life
that was meant for Aethelflaed.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.639
-Hardly what she deserves.
-That is a choice you are making.

34:59.199 --> 35:04.840
If I place someone to rule here
who might forge a path to peace,

35:04.920 --> 35:07.640
someone who might not necessarily please
the Ealdormen,

35:07.720 --> 35:11.120
but whose popularity with the people
might force them to accept it...

35:12.800 --> 35:17.640
Let us call him a Lord and Protector
who would rule here

35:17.720 --> 35:20.920
just for a few years
until things are less volatile.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.560
I wondered if that person should be you.

35:32.000 --> 35:32.840
Me?

35:39.080 --> 35:40.840
I do not want to rule here.

35:40.920 --> 35:44.080
Yes, but as we know,
you rarely get to make your own choices.

35:45.760 --> 35:50.200
Find an equilibrium,
wait for an Ealdorman to come of age,

35:50.680 --> 35:53.880
if my niece survives, betroth her
to someone Aethelflaed chooses.

35:54.200 --> 35:58.640
It is clear to me you have the respect
of the people here.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.400
They listen to you.

36:01.600 --> 36:04.400
So, perhaps we should use that
to our mutual advantage.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.880
I do not seek advantage.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.280
Even to bring peace?

36:08.200 --> 36:11.720
You accept,
you ensure Mercia returns to how it was,

36:11.800 --> 36:14.160
before Aethelred destroyed everything.

36:14.240 --> 36:17.360
-If I do not?
-As you said, there will be slaughter.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.760
And that will be a choice you are making.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.400
Accept and your reputation
will be restored

36:26.480 --> 36:28.720
and your men given status and wealth.

36:30.240 --> 36:34.040
And in a few years, you will be free
to pursue whichever dreams you may have.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.920
I could give you the troops you need
to retake the fortress you lost.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.080
And in return?

36:45.120 --> 36:48.000
I would be your King
and expect your loyalty.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.280
I expect an answer by tomorrow.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.200
[Brida groans]

37:26.800 --> 37:28.400
How do I know you are Brida?

37:29.480 --> 37:33.480
[stammering] I fought with Guthrum.
I followed Ragnar.

37:33.800 --> 37:35.200
I killed men at Tettenhall--

37:35.280 --> 37:39.440
So, you have heard of Saxon battles.
That does not make you Brida.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.640
[sighs]

37:43.720 --> 37:45.600
[groaning]

37:50.320 --> 37:52.840
It is Cnut's babe you carry,
or that of a Welshman?

37:54.560 --> 37:58.680
The babe was made by Cnut,
but Cnut's fallen.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.440
I do not know you.

38:03.640 --> 38:07.080
Cnut's cousin, Sigtryggr of Irland.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.720
Sigtryggr was defeated and killed.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.360
Defeated, yes,
driven from his settlements, yes.

38:14.160 --> 38:17.000
But at this moment, quite alive.

38:20.960 --> 38:25.800
-And who do you belong to now, Brida?
-No man. I am a warrior alone.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.920
You do not look like a warrior.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.920
Give me your sword and I will show you.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
Give you my sword? You might kill me.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.160
No, the Brida I have heard of is cunning,
so I will stay armed.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.120
If you are who you say you are,
then show me.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.640
[Sigtryggr sighs]

39:05.000 --> 39:07.960
Listen to me. Talk.

39:12.320 --> 39:17.000
Prepare to be broken,
as you tried to break me.

39:23.240 --> 39:25.920
[groaning]

39:26.000 --> 39:28.520
[men laughing]

39:28.600 --> 39:33.560
[Sigtryggr] Brida!
You have the anger of a she-wolf! [laughs]

39:33.920 --> 39:35.040
[door closes]

39:39.200 --> 39:41.320
[indistinct chatter]

39:41.400 --> 39:43.000
-Is he joking?
-[Uhtred] No.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.680
So, he's either lost his mind,
or he's a genius like his father.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.200
He says that Aethelflaed will be defended.
And it is true.

39:54.200 --> 39:57.000
No other leader in Mercia
would protect her like I would.

39:57.760 --> 39:58.600
But?

39:59.320 --> 40:01.560
But I was not born to be
the Lord of Mercia.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.200
I never sought that kind of power.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.320
Well, perhaps that in itself
makes you the best man.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.640
Mercia has suffered from being led
by ambition.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.560
So, apart from the silver and the power

40:15.120 --> 40:18.560
and saving the woman you love,
what is holding you back?

40:18.640 --> 40:22.720
Giving my loyalty to another Saxon king.
I swore to myself I would not do that.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.520
I swear I will not drink too much ale
and I frequently go back on my word.

40:30.600 --> 40:34.320
Nobody wants to rip the two kingdoms
apart, least of all Aethelflaed.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.560
It is a path to peace.
And she would be safe.

40:42.520 --> 40:46.480
So, we have no conclusion
other than Edward has outwitted you.

40:47.200 --> 40:48.040
For now.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.960
So, he is as clever as his father.

40:50.800 --> 40:54.120
Which will be good for all Saxons,
including you.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.920
-[gulping]
-[men laughing and chattering]

40:59.000 --> 40:59.840
[Brida sighs]

41:00.840 --> 41:04.000
How did Cnut fall?
Was it his arrogance or his anger?

41:05.600 --> 41:09.200
Both, but mainly his betrayal.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.440
So, who did he murder
to further his ambition?

41:15.200 --> 41:17.560
He took Ragnar, who I loved,
and blamed another.

41:17.640 --> 41:20.800
Mm. The man had a reputation for cunning.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.480
I had always admired that.

41:23.480 --> 41:27.040
But he died dishonored, if he allowed
his woman to be enslaved.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.920
That was the work
of Uhtred the Dane Slayer.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.600
But I will have my revenge on him.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.040
I have heard of this Dane Slayer

41:37.560 --> 41:40.120
and what he has done
to our people for years.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.920
Why did Cnut not come
when we requested help?

41:49.320 --> 41:50.560
We had our own battles.

41:55.440 --> 41:56.280
What?

41:57.400 --> 42:00.560
-You escaped without our help.
-My kinsfolk did not.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.200
Our women and children
were murdered by the Irish

42:04.280 --> 42:06.280
before we had a chance to save them.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.240
Then you should avenge them
and make more children.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.080
Perhaps you're right.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.760
Grow strong here.

42:17.200 --> 42:21.480
Rest the men, get more silver,
then retake Dyflin.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.480
-[guard groaning]
-It seems empty, no?

42:29.240 --> 42:32.200
Yes, the greatest riches are in Wessex.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.480
Sadly, the Saxons do not like to share.

42:35.160 --> 42:38.200
And yet they say their faith
is based on love.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.480
They talk a lot of shit.

42:40.280 --> 42:43.480
More shit than the Irish?
This I can't believe.

42:43.800 --> 42:47.640
You have a lot to learn.
What are you gonna do for now?

42:47.720 --> 42:50.440
I'll cut off the head of this man
and send it to Hywel.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.560
[Pyrlig] It's just around the next corner.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.800
-Where are we going?
-It's a safer place to hide.

43:06.880 --> 43:07.800
[Pyrlig] Let's go.

43:12.520 --> 43:13.600
That's it. Go inside.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.160
Go.

43:19.240 --> 43:20.080
Stay there.

43:24.160 --> 43:26.360
[Aelswith]
Show me that child, Father Pyrlig.

43:27.360 --> 43:28.600
Do not hide him from me.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.800
[sighing]

43:36.680 --> 43:39.640
[exhales] He is here?

43:40.280 --> 43:42.640
-You know about him?
-Indeed.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.560
I fear he had been taken, or lost forever.

43:50.320 --> 43:51.880
Did Uhtred bring him here?

43:52.840 --> 43:55.480
Apparently, even Aegelesburg
is better than the road.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.360
-Had quite the adventure by all accounts.
-Then I thank him for it.

43:59.720 --> 44:03.120
I know you dislike him,
but maybe Edward is right this time.

44:04.160 --> 44:06.240
Father Pyrlig, what have I not been told?

44:09.600 --> 44:12.800
[dramatic vocalizing]

44:42.560 --> 44:45.040
There is a rumor
you have struck a bargain.

44:45.560 --> 44:46.400
[Edward] Indeed.

44:47.320 --> 44:50.720
-I do not like the man.
-I do not need your approval.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.560
But it may be the only compromise.

44:52.880 --> 44:54.320
The Ealdormen will complain,

44:54.960 --> 44:57.360
but this time,
do not treat them too harshly.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.160
Then you will find some redemption.

45:00.520 --> 45:04.800
-I do not need redemption, either.
-Oh, my son, you do.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.320
If only for the sins of your mother.

45:19.560 --> 45:23.360
-[Edward] Who is this?
-He is Aethelstan.

45:26.200 --> 45:27.760
He cannot be here.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.000
I know it is difficult
for you to acknowledge him,

45:31.680 --> 45:35.240
but I wondered,
now that certain threats are absent...

45:36.440 --> 45:39.400
perhaps the moment has come
for you to be reconciled.

45:39.480 --> 45:41.480
-Mother, I cannot.
-Please.

45:42.600 --> 45:46.720
He has lived a life of lies,
and that must be righted.

45:50.480 --> 45:55.600
I was wrong to wrench you apart,
and it's something that I deeply regret.

45:56.560 --> 46:01.640
I thought my past actions
were protecting you and Wessex,

46:02.080 --> 46:03.680
that I acted in the name of God.

46:04.160 --> 46:11.120
But God put love in your heart,
for your first wife and this child.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.120
And I should not have ignored that.

46:17.840 --> 46:21.040
So, I ask for your forgiveness...

46:22.480 --> 46:23.320
and his.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.480
He needs your protection.

46:36.320 --> 46:38.400
Place him back to where he was concealed.

47:09.880 --> 47:13.120
[all vocalizing]

47:24.960 --> 47:26.360
[grunting]

47:28.560 --> 47:29.400
My King.

47:47.480 --> 47:50.120
-[Edward] Have you made your choice?
-I will accept.

47:52.760 --> 47:54.400
If I can rule as my own man.

47:56.080 --> 47:59.760
I've never wanted to control Mercia.
Only see it at peace.

47:59.840 --> 48:01.920
Good, then we are of one mind.

48:03.760 --> 48:07.000
At long last, I strike a bargain
with Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

48:07.640 --> 48:11.800
That is a name from another life,
but yes, for now, we strike a bargain.

48:20.000 --> 48:20.840
Guards!

48:21.920 --> 48:23.840
Cenric, stand down your men.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.680
Lady, I cannot. The King forbids it.

48:27.200 --> 48:29.560
I am told this is
where my daughter's body is.

48:30.720 --> 48:32.680
This is where your King has led us.

48:33.400 --> 48:38.440
Cenric, please, in the name of Alfred,
open the gates and stand down your men.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.920
[Cenric] Open the gates!

49:05.640 --> 49:09.120
-Oh, my dearest girl, you've come home.
-[crying] Aelfwynn is dead.

49:09.680 --> 49:10.840
No, child.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.600
A miracle has occurred
and you are mistaken in your heartbreak.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.680
[gasping]

49:25.840 --> 49:28.880
-[sighs, sniffles]
-Mama?

49:44.760 --> 49:45.600
[sighs]

49:51.960 --> 49:54.160
-[Finan] <i>♪ This night together! ♪</i>
-[laughter]

49:54.240 --> 49:58.840
Oh, oh! Eh, eh! To Eadith,
for not killing the Lady Aelfwynn.

49:59.320 --> 50:00.960
-[all] <i>To Eadith!</i>
<i>-Yes!</i>

50:01.480 --> 50:04.680
Your brother has restored peace,
the people are being fed,

50:05.760 --> 50:07.080
and the fever passes.

50:07.480 --> 50:10.480
To Sihtric and Aethelflaed
and Young Uhtred, too.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.160
May they return safely.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.640
But if there's ale still left
when they get here,

50:14.720 --> 50:16.720
then we have let ourselves down.

50:16.800 --> 50:21.000
[laughing]

50:21.600 --> 50:24.480
Mostly, everyone now looks forward
to the new Lord.

50:25.040 --> 50:26.080
Who is that to be?

50:27.560 --> 50:29.920
He has asked Uhtred.

50:32.800 --> 50:36.760
To the lands, to the silver
and to the women!

50:37.000 --> 50:39.240
To Uhtred of Mercia!

50:39.480 --> 50:41.520
[all] Uhtred of Mercia!

50:41.600 --> 50:43.520
[laughter]

50:43.600 --> 50:45.720
[Finan] Finally, he can pay us some money!

50:45.800 --> 50:47.320
[Pyrlig] I very much doubt it.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.280
[intense vocalizing]
