Another human just discovered
that they're Inhuman.

00:07.174 --> 00:09.174
Now they're out there
with their new powers.

00:09.176 --> 00:12.811
(YAWNS) There's too many
all-nighters since
the Terrigen wave, Cap.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.214
I'm just exhausted.
Sorry, Iron Man.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.516
Still plenty
of Inhuman cocoons left
to check out.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.284
Can you finish without me?
(CRASHING IN DISTANCE)

00:19.286 --> 00:21.020
I'm heading back

I'm gonna guess you're
a straggler Ultron bot

00:37.238 --> 00:38.804
that didn't get destroyed
with the others.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.175
Huh. Now your turn.

00:43.177 --> 00:46.412
You get to guess why
they call me Inferno.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.889
Whoa! That's right.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.959
(GROANS)

01:02.562 --> 01:05.164
Watch that first step,
Inferno. It's a doozy.

01:10.203 --> 01:12.571
Captain America
and Iron Man?

01:12.573 --> 01:15.507
That's cool you're here
and all, but, uh...

01:15.509 --> 01:17.342
I've got skills.
Check it.

IRON MAN:
We checked it.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.289
You just blew up
a nice hotel.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.458
I know you mean well,
but your powers are too wild

01:32.460 --> 01:34.760
and out of control.

All of them.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.742
Except maybe Inferno.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.744
You can stay safe

I'm not dreaming.
This is real life.

Inferno, Ms. Marvel,
target the bot's legs.

04:18.259 --> 04:22.127

(CAPTAIN AMERICA

04:45.919 --> 04:48.987
So, you're both Inhumans.

04:48.989 --> 04:52.457
No. We're new heroes...
Or trying to be.

04:52.459 --> 04:55.327
I mean, we gotta do something
with our powers, right?

04:55.329 --> 04:56.561
Well, the choice is yours.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.897
No one says you have
to use your powers.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.899
But maybe you can
become heroes.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.335
Maybe even someday
you can become Avengers.

05:03.337 --> 05:06.838
Whoa, simmer down.
They're just kids.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.373
What? I like their moxie.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.177
What, does no one say
"moxie" anymore?

05:13.913 --> 05:16.014
Fine. I'm bringing
"moxie" back.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.818
I don't have time for this.
Just send the kids to Attilan.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.620
The Inhumans will take care
of them, teach them how

05:21.622 --> 05:23.388
to use their powers,
and keep them out of our hair.

05:24.957 --> 05:27.993
Well, new heroes,
seeing as how you helped us,

05:27.995 --> 05:30.195
I know a good way
to thank you.

No...

I thought I'd give them
a Tower tour.

06:39.333 --> 06:40.599
To thank them
for their help.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.534
This lab's got space.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.935
Way bigger than
his old lab.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.238
But his old lab was closer
to his bedroom.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.440
This one's all the way at
the other end of everything.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.542
How do you know so much about
the Tower?

06:50.544 --> 06:53.245
Floor plans
are on the Internet,
except the basement.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.681
For some reason,
no one knows what's in
the Avengers Tower basement.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.019
You can tell us!
What's in the basement?

07:01.021 --> 07:04.222
Is it a spaceship? Oh, I bet
there's an Avengers tank.

to scrub all

07:06.193 --> 07:08.393
the floor plans off
the Internet.

Phase Projector.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.098

some sleep.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.734
Never knew you were so good
at microelectronics.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.303
Eh, it's how I build
and fix my arrows.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.105
But if people knew
I was good at this,

07:20.107 --> 07:21.807
you'd expect me to
do more around here.

You remember Inferno.

07:24.445 --> 07:26.478

It's our

I can't get a hold
of Falcon or Hawkeye

because somebody cut
the communications.

my presence.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.854
With authority.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.656
I don't think we've met.

Thinks he's slick.
But he's just a common,
ordinary thief.

08:52.900 --> 08:55.233
While everyone's busy
with Inhumans and bots,

08:55.235 --> 08:57.869
I made my move
on Avengers Tower.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.305
That doesn't make me
a common thief.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.741
That makes me
a very uncommon thief.

If Ghost thinks
he's taken us out,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.161
it gives us a chance
to find Falcon and Hawkeye.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.830
That's Thor's room.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.632
(GASPS)

12:16.869 --> 12:19.904
Man! Thor's place
is decked out.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.073
Who knew Asgardians
had such good taste?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.942
Um, everybody knows that.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.844
Will you please focus?

12:25.846 --> 12:28.113
I need to be looking
for Falcon and Hawkeye,

12:28.115 --> 12:30.281
not babysitting annoying kids.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.550
Uh, hey!
Those annoying kids...

12:32.552 --> 12:34.786
Yeah, they just saved
your life back there.

12:34.788 --> 12:38.456
Yeah, you know what?
Iron Man used to be
my third favorite hero.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.793
But not anymore.
My new third favorite
is Captain America.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.428
Uh, let's leave me
out of this.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.330
Get down!
(GRUNTS)

12:46.766 --> 12:49.134
(YELLS, GROANS)

12:50.903 --> 12:52.203
Kid!

12:53.105 --> 12:55.240
(LAUGHING)

12:55.242 --> 12:57.776
You want him?
And Falcon and Hawkeye?

12:57.778 --> 13:00.712
Come get them.
We'll be waiting downstairs.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.447
(LAUGHING)

13:02.449 --> 13:05.216
I'm used to whipping Ghost.
Not the other way around.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.552
Need a way to fight back
without my armor.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.388
You were a tough guy before
you built the armor, right?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.123
She has a point, Tony.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.226
Yeah, but being tough's
not gonna beat Ghost.

13:15.228 --> 13:18.630
The three of us?
We've gotta be creative
and outsmart him.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.131
Sounds like fun.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.901
Our next move.
We go right at Ghost.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.569
Hit him where it hurts.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.471
He's luring us
into a trap.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.940
He's got Falcon,
Hawkeye, and Inferno.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.708
We don't have a choice.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.313
(GROANING)

13:35.315 --> 13:38.483
I could unfaze them now,
but in their
current positions...

13:38.485 --> 13:42.120
Well, let's just say
it'd get a bit messy.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.622
No shield and no armor.

13:44.624 --> 13:48.960
Not much of a challenge
in two helpless Avengers
and a kid.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.530
You're wrong.
I'm not my shield,
he's not his armor,

13:52.532 --> 13:55.300
and the kid's got skills.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.367
(SQUEALS SOFTLY)

13:56.369 --> 13:58.937
Aw. That's a nice pep talk.

13:58.939 --> 14:02.974
But while you
were running around,
I got what I came for.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.209
Friday.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.712
The most advanced
computer AI system ever.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.048
With all the secrets
of Tony Stark,

14:10.050 --> 14:13.484
(GROANING)
the Avengers, and the world,
and it's mine.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.954
Now comes the fun.

14:16.889 --> 14:19.224
(RUMBLING)

14:19.226 --> 14:22.994
Uh, New York's not supposed
to have earthquakes. Right?

14:22.996 --> 14:25.864
I'm phasing the ground
underneath the Tower,

14:25.866 --> 14:27.532
making it like quicksand.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.900
(RUMBLING)

14:28.902 --> 14:30.735
(CAR ALARM BLARING)

14:30.737 --> 14:33.137
I just got a better idea.

14:33.139 --> 14:36.407
I'll be watching all of you
get buried alive.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.042
(ALL GROAN)

14:39.712 --> 14:41.546

14:42.481 --> 14:44.315
(GROANS)

14:45.417 --> 14:46.918
(GRUNTS)

14:49.255 --> 14:51.022
What just happened?
Where are we?

14:51.024 --> 14:52.924
Later. We've got
to get out of here.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.631
We're too late.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.504
Inferno, blast us
a hole out of here!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.673
One hole, coming up.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.209
It's not working.
We're too deep!

15:11.211 --> 15:12.944
What else we got?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.046
(LAUGHS)
Nowhere to go,

15:15.048 --> 15:17.348
other than straight down.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.017
In here!

15:21.120 --> 15:23.121
Run! We gotta get upstairs

15:23.123 --> 15:25.356
faster than
the Tower's sinking!

15:25.358 --> 15:27.926
(GLASS SHATTERING)

15:27.928 --> 15:29.694
How'd you know where
the stairs were?

15:29.696 --> 15:31.763
Oh, we know everything about
Avengers Tower.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.966
Didn't you know?
Apparently it's all online.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.469
Okay, assuming our lungs
don't blow up from
all this stair climbing,

15:38.471 --> 15:40.571
what are we gonna do
when we get to the top?

15:40.573 --> 15:43.041
I have an idea,
but I don't have the time.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.643
If you've got the idea,
then we'll get you the time.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.545
Ms. Marvel, take Tony.

15:49.815 --> 15:51.549
I know this is weird, but...

15:51.551 --> 15:53.484
(GRUNTING)

15:55.087 --> 15:56.955
(GRUNTS)

15:56.957 --> 15:59.824
The rest of you,
we need to slow down
or stop the Tower.

15:59.826 --> 16:03.795
Oh, is that all?
I was worried you were going
to ask for something hard.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.297
(SIGHS)
Ghost phased the ground
into quicksand.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.599
So if the force pulling
the Tower down is gravity,

16:08.601 --> 16:10.969
we need a way
to overcome gravity.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.171
Overcome gravity.
Good thinking.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.974
Dante, we need you
to make like
a rocket engine.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.143
You might want to step back.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.412
(GRUNTS)

16:23.082 --> 16:24.916

16:24.918 --> 16:26.017

CAPTAIN AMERICA:
Keep it up, Inferno!
It's working.

16:55.482 --> 16:58.649
Keep it straight,
otherwise we're gonna tip
the building over.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.752
(GLASS SHATTERING)

17:02.054 --> 17:04.288
Now it's up to Tony.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.558
I may not have my armor,
but I've still got
my best weapon.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.493
MS. MARVEL: Your mind, right?
But barring that,

17:09.496 --> 17:11.295
I can use my Phase Projector.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.064
I'll try to match
the Ghost's frequency

17:13.066 --> 17:14.531
and reverse
his phase polarity.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.967

Keep that ceiling

17:20.640 --> 17:21.973
Um, this is too heavy.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.909
(GRUNTING)

17:24.911 --> 17:28.212
You can do it.
I believe in you.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.182
Why do they make buildings
so heavy?

17:31.184 --> 17:33.484
I can't find
the right frequency.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.986
Give me a few
more seconds!

17:34.988 --> 17:36.487
I can't hold it!

17:36.489 --> 17:38.256
You're stronger
than you think.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.624
Got it!

17:42.094 --> 17:43.227
(GRUNTS)

17:58.243 --> 18:00.278
Well, this can't be happening.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.582
Huh? (GRUNTS)

18:04.584 --> 18:06.784
Something's jamming
my phasing!

18:06.786 --> 18:08.453
Stark!

18:11.924 --> 18:14.158
Oh, leaving so soon?

18:15.694 --> 18:17.695
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)

18:19.231 --> 18:20.131
We're unarmed.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.766
You still think
we're helpless?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.769
How's this possible?
I had you!

18:24.771 --> 18:26.471
IRON MAN: It was easy.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.040
After I blocked your powers,

18:29.042 --> 18:32.243
I busted up the jammer
you had on the Tower
communications systems.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.544
So I could do this.
(BEEPS)

18:41.453 --> 18:43.087
Big deal.

18:43.089 --> 18:47.024
I can still take you apart
piece by piece!

18:52.297 --> 18:53.931
Did we get him?

18:53.933 --> 18:56.801
No. He's in the basement.
Yes! The basement.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.210
Spread out.
There's a ghost
in here somewhere.

Sorry.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.711
(GROANS)

19:40.713 --> 19:45.449
I suppose I should give you
a chance to surrender.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.186
Nah. Ms. Marvel,
you wanna finish him?

19:48.188 --> 19:51.889
You're totally my third
favorite Avenger again.
Embiggen!

19:52.558 --> 19:55.693
(GROANING)

19:55.695 --> 19:59.030
Don't come back
here ever again!

20:05.237 --> 20:07.438
I got our girl Friday.

20:13.712 --> 20:18.015
"In recognition of
Avengers Day in the city
of West Burbank."

20:18.017 --> 20:20.218
What an honor.
INFERNO: That's it?

20:20.220 --> 20:23.821
The secret of Avengers
basement is old junk?
(FLIES BUZZING)

20:25.390 --> 20:27.225
I am so disillusioned.

20:33.332 --> 20:36.067
FRIDAY: <i> Structural tests</i>
<i>have passed.</i>
Good.

20:36.069 --> 20:39.503
I've got a few ideas on how
to upgrade the Tower.

20:39.505 --> 20:42.607
Have Falcon oversee
the cleanup.

20:42.609 --> 20:45.443
No, wait.
Have Hawkeye do it.

20:45.445 --> 20:48.212
He needs to do more
around here.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.214
Inferno and Ms. Marvel
are about to leave.

20:50.216 --> 20:51.949
Thought you might want
to say something to them.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.718
I don't want to say anything
to anybody.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.586
I'm so sleepy
I can't even...

20:56.521 --> 20:58.256

20:58.924 --> 21:00.291
Tony...

21:01.693 --> 21:03.728
Couldn't have done it

21:03.730 --> 21:06.264
For kids,
you're all right.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.299

21:08.301 --> 21:11.102
Wow. He was actually
nice to us.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.070
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
That's because you earned
his respect.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.605
You kids aren't Avengers yet.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.974
But if you keep it up,
you will be.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.809
Um, Cap?

21:18.811 --> 21:22.413
Before we leave, I never got
to take that selfie with you.

21:22.415 --> 21:26.017
Actually, I never got
to take a selfie with you.
