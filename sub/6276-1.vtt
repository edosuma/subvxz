00:14.041 --> 00:15.750
TERRY:
The old man made parole.

00:15.834 --> 00:17.750
He wasn't supposed to be out
for five more years.

00:17.834 --> 00:18.917
He's out, Ray.

00:19.000 --> 00:19.750
RAY:
You let him near this family,

00:19.834 --> 00:22.208
everything we worked for...

00:22.291 --> 00:23.250
it'll be over.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.500
DEONTE:
She's dead, dawg.

00:24.583 --> 00:25.792
RAY: You think
you're the first person

00:25.875 --> 00:26.917

woke up in bed with a dead body?

coming out in a month

00:31.792 --> 00:33.417

to get you out of this.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.417

Since he's been back here,

00:41.834 --> 00:42.625
he's been putting shit
in your head.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.625
I'm a sexual anorexic.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.667

Great guns you got there.

00:48.417 --> 00:49.291
TERRY:
You're cheating on him.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.792
You can't go
from his bed into mine.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.959

Dad's girlfriend, Claudette?

00:57.208 --> 00:59.250

His name's Daryll.

Hell yeah, I'm a Donovan.

01:03.959 --> 01:05.625
Then get used to that prick
letting you down.

01:05.709 --> 01:07.750
I stole half a
million for you.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.375
Ray said you'd stolen
a lot of money from Sully.

01:10.458 --> 01:12.041
You'd be dead
if it weren't for us.

01:12.125 --> 01:14.125
What did you say to him?
I don't remember.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.917
You have to remember.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.166
I can't.

01:17.250 --> 01:18.792

11:52.709 --> 11:54.500
It's not all bad.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.834
So, you're still having sex
two times a day?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.625
Why are you so obsessed
with that?

11:58.709 --> 12:00.083
I know women who would love

12:00.166 --> 12:02.458
to be fucked by their husbands
two times a day.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.458
Abby...

12:04.542 --> 12:07.125
is it possible his-his...

12:07.208 --> 12:08.667
hypersexual behavior

12:08.750 --> 12:09.542
is a symptom of his abuse?

12:09.625 --> 12:12.959
Is it possible
he just likes to fuck?

12:13.041 --> 12:14.959
Until he can face
his molestation,

12:15.041 --> 12:17.709
I'm afraid your marriage
is going to be in trouble.

12:17.792 --> 12:20.083
I should never have
told you about that.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.792
(sighs)

12:26.875 --> 12:27.959
(footsteps depart)

12:28.041 --> 12:28.875
(door opens)

12:33.834 --> 12:36.041
(sighs)

12:36.125 --> 12:37.333
(phone rings)

12:37.417 --> 12:38.500
(phone chimes)

12:38.583 --> 12:39.291
Yeah.

12:39.375 --> 12:40.500
FRANK (over speakerphone):
Ray.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.166
We're fucked.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.375
The director's back.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.458
He's not buying the story.

12:45.542 --> 12:46.500
What'd you do, Frank?

12:46.583 --> 12:49.500
(sighs)
Ray, calm down.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.917
What'd you fucking do?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.041
I'm coming there.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.166
(phone chimes)

12:54.250 --> 12:55.125
Ray...?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.208
(sighs)

13:07.917 --> 13:08.834
Ballistics came back.

13:08.917 --> 13:09.917
What are you
talking about?

13:10.000 --> 13:11.375
The fucking ballistics, Ray.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.333
So how'd you fuck it up, Frank?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.583
They pulled the bullet
from Avi's chest,

13:14.667 --> 13:16.333
and it matched Sully's gun.

13:16.417 --> 13:18.917
They know he was there,
and they know he works for you.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
What was I supposed
to do, Ray, huh?

13:21.083 --> 13:22.458
He knew I was fucking lying!

13:22.542 --> 13:24.709
(under breath):
Piece of shit.

13:24.792 --> 13:26.125
Ray, give me a fucking minute,
will you?!

13:26.208 --> 13:27.959
Ray. Ray.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.834
This isn't Volcheck
we're dealing with.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.291
Cochran's the
next in line

13:31.375 --> 13:32.542
to take over
the Bureau.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.500
Fuck, Ray,
don't do this.

13:34.583 --> 13:36.375
How are we supposed to keep
our stories straight?

13:36.458 --> 13:37.625
We're not.

13:37.709 --> 13:39.917
Excuse me. Can I help you?

13:44.834 --> 13:46.375
I'm Ray Donovan.

13:46.458 --> 13:48.583
Yeah, oh, I know who you are.

13:48.667 --> 13:51.041
You're a bag man
for movie stars.

13:51.125 --> 13:55.250
You're also an extortionist
and a wiretapper.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.709
Well, basically, you're
an all-around piece of shit.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.458
So, why am I standing here?

13:59.542 --> 14:00.375
Because you were
on that dock that night,

14:00.458 --> 14:02.125
and I would really
like to know why.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.000
(clears throat)

14:06.083 --> 14:07.417
Okay, look...

14:07.500 --> 14:09.417
uh... I have
a press conference today.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.542
I was all set to give
the Medal of Valor

14:11.625 --> 14:13.375
to Agent Volcheck...

14:13.458 --> 14:15.750
and this fucking idiot,
when I got this

14:15.834 --> 14:17.583
ballistics report back.

14:17.667 --> 14:20.834
Now, would you like to tell me
what really happened?

14:20.917 --> 14:23.583
You don't want to know
what really happened.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.291
Your father
is Mickey Donovan, right?

14:27.375 --> 14:28.458
So what?

14:28.542 --> 14:29.792
Why was he there that night?

14:30.959 --> 14:32.208
You don't want to know.

14:32.291 --> 14:33.583
Oh, I've had enough
of this shit.

14:33.667 --> 14:34.750
I'm putting you away, pal.

14:34.834 --> 14:37.000
I brought Sully out here
to kill my father.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.458
Paid him $2 million
to do it.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.834
Jesus fucking Christ, Ray.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.458
Will you shut the fuck up?

14:47.542 --> 14:48.834
(hangs up phone)

14:48.917 --> 14:50.750
Wow.

14:50.834 --> 14:52.750
(laughs)

14:52.834 --> 14:54.625
That didn't work out so well,
now, did it?

14:54.709 --> 14:56.792
(laughs)
No.

14:56.875 --> 14:58.417
Either of you two guys

14:58.500 --> 15:01.375
want to tell me
who the fuck shot Sully?

15:01.458 --> 15:05.125
My father.

15:09.875 --> 15:12.417
Uh, okay, so actually...

15:12.500 --> 15:14.291
Get the fuck out of my sight.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.208
All right, I need your father
in this office right away.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.000
What for?

15:23.083 --> 15:24.250
I'm not gonna
take your word

15:24.333 --> 15:26.166
for all this shit, now, am I?

15:26.250 --> 15:27.500
Listen to me.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.959
Do yourself a favor--

15:31.041 --> 15:32.542
have your
press conference,

15:32.625 --> 15:34.625
tell your story...

15:34.709 --> 15:37.000
enjoy your moment.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.333
America's Most Wanted
is dead.

15:39.417 --> 15:40.583
You're a hero.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.917
God bless America.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.750
Ray.

15:44.834 --> 15:47.333
You don't know
where he is, do you?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.625
Fuck you.

15:52.709 --> 15:53.166
(door shuts)

15:55.500 --> 15:57.709
Faster taps.
Speed is power.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.125
Flip it. Flip it.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.917
All right,
on the balls of your feet.

16:01.000 --> 16:01.417
Right there. Right there.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.709
Beautiful.

16:04.792 --> 16:07.458
Terrance, what the fuck?

16:07.542 --> 16:09.709
What's on your mind?

16:09.792 --> 16:11.792
(hip-hop music playing)

16:11.875 --> 16:12.583
Nothing.

16:12.667 --> 16:16.041
(panting):
Take over.

16:22.542 --> 16:24.875
Oh, shit!

16:24.959 --> 16:26.375
Pat Riley up in
this motherfucker.

16:26.458 --> 16:29.208
I look okay?

16:29.291 --> 16:30.917
You look clean, yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.750
You got any long pants?

16:32.834 --> 16:34.667
No.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.917
Don't worry about it.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.125
You look good.

16:45.959 --> 16:46.917
All right, hands up.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.250
Hands up, on your toes.
Come on.

17:00.875 --> 17:03.291
(line ringing)

17:03.375 --> 17:05.250
FRANCES:
Hello?

17:06.500 --> 17:09.291
Hello?

17:09.375 --> 17:10.291
(hangs up phone)

17:13.542 --> 17:14.166
Where's Mick?

17:17.750 --> 17:19.583
He's in Mexico.

17:19.667 --> 17:21.291
But I don't know where.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.625
I need to find him, Terry.

17:24.709 --> 17:27.583
Ray... come on.

17:27.667 --> 17:28.667
Leave it alone.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.959
No. I can't.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.625
It's for business.

17:32.709 --> 17:35.625
It's not business.

17:35.709 --> 17:38.375
It's just you.

17:43.542 --> 17:44.458
Hey.

17:44.542 --> 17:45.875
Hey, Bunch.

17:45.959 --> 17:48.041
Do I look okay?

17:48.959 --> 17:49.792
I don't have
any long pants!

17:49.875 --> 17:52.291
You look fine, Bunch.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.375
You know where Mick is?

17:54.458 --> 17:55.750
No.

17:55.834 --> 17:57.333
He left town.
What do you care?

18:00.959 --> 18:02.375
Where's Daryll?

18:02.458 --> 18:04.333
(phone ringing)

18:06.458 --> 18:08.166
What up?

18:08.250 --> 18:10.041
It's Ray. Where's Mick?

18:10.125 --> 18:12.542
Oh, so now you call me?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.166
I need to find him, Daryll.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.792
You're the Magnum, P.I.,
motherfucker.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.375
(laughs)
You find him.

18:18.458 --> 18:20.208
Shit.

18:42.875 --> 18:45.750
(phone ringing)

18:48.125 --> 18:48.917
Yeah?

18:49.000 --> 18:49.750
Yo, I fucked up, dawg.
(women shouting)

18:49.834 --> 18:52.041
I fucked up big.

18:52.125 --> 18:53.917
You have to get over here ASAP.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.542
MARVIN:
♪ Slippin' into darkness, yo,
these niggas wanna kill me... ♪

19:02.625 --> 19:03.667
It's my sister's
boyfriend.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.583
He hangs out at my
house all the time.

19:05.667 --> 19:06.083
I love this song.

19:06.166 --> 19:08.291
He's full of shit.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.208
He's always saying

19:09.291 --> 19:11.208
he knows all these
fucking famous people.

19:11.291 --> 19:12.875
Tommy Wheeler...

19:12.959 --> 19:13.917
Marvin Gaye Washington.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.542
(phone clatters on ground)
Oh...

19:16.625 --> 19:17.125
(grunts)

19:17.208 --> 19:19.291
BOY:
Oh, dude...!

19:19.375 --> 19:20.667
You all right?

19:20.750 --> 19:22.041
(groaning)

19:22.125 --> 19:23.375
GIRL:
You all right?

19:23.458 --> 19:25.291
WOMAN (shouting):
I cannot believe this.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.875
I cannot believe... this!

19:26.959 --> 19:29.917
I leave my house for 24 hours.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.709
GIRL (crying):
I'm sorry!

19:32.792 --> 19:34.834
WOMAN:
And I come back to find you

19:34.917 --> 19:37.333
and my husband in my bed.

19:37.417 --> 19:39.208
What is wrong with you?!

19:39.291 --> 19:40.667
How old are you?

19:40.750 --> 19:42.583
(girl crying, gasping)

19:42.667 --> 19:44.458
GIRL:
It doesn't matter, okay?!

19:44.542 --> 19:46.208
(indistinct arguing)

19:48.333 --> 19:49.500
It ain't snow, dawg.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.417
It ain't snow,
so she came home early.

19:51.500 --> 19:52.083
It's that global warming;

19:52.166 --> 19:54.083
Big Bear, they have no snow.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.208
She's home.

19:56.291 --> 19:58.083
(women shouting)

19:58.166 --> 19:59.917
Who's the girl?

20:00.000 --> 20:00.750
I-I was at American Idol
last night.

20:00.834 --> 20:01.750
She's top three.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.208
What's her name?

20:04.291 --> 20:06.250
Bitch can sing!
She-she gonna win.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.333
You don't know her name, do you?

20:08.417 --> 20:09.834
GIRL:
Let me explain!

20:09.917 --> 20:11.250
WOMAN:
I am going to kick your ass!

20:11.333 --> 20:12.834
And after I kick your ass,
I'm kicking his ass.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.458
You got guns in there?
Hell, no.

20:14.542 --> 20:16.417
They locked up downstairs,
like you told me.

20:16.500 --> 20:16.792
I got kids in here, man.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.583
(gunshot)

20:18.667 --> 20:20.792
(girl screaming, crying)
Oh, shit!

20:20.875 --> 20:23.000
(girl crying)

20:24.083 --> 20:26.000
(gasping):
Oh, my God.

20:26.959 --> 20:30.417
I'm sick and tired
of this motherfucker, Ray.

20:30.500 --> 20:31.625
Yeah, I know you are.

20:31.709 --> 20:33.750
(panting)

20:33.834 --> 20:34.792
(sighs)
He's a piece of shit.

20:34.875 --> 20:35.917
(crying):
Yes.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.041
You should shoot him.

20:38.125 --> 20:39.291
Huh?
What?

20:39.375 --> 20:39.500
Go ahead.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.500
(crying)

20:48.417 --> 20:49.458
(crying)

20:49.542 --> 20:50.750
Keep pressure on that.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.583
Oh, my God,
I'm dying.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.750
I was supposed
to perform tonight.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.375
Now I'm gonna die
at number three.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.625
(sniffles)

21:02.709 --> 21:04.000
(shuddering)

21:04.083 --> 21:06.583
My insurance card
is in the inside pocket.

21:06.667 --> 21:07.500
(panting)

21:09.625 --> 21:10.792
What are you doing?!
Are you crazy?!

21:10.875 --> 21:11.667
(phone ringing)

21:11.750 --> 21:14.500
Keep your mouth shut,
you hear me?

21:14.583 --> 21:16.125
(phone beeps)
Yeah.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.291
AMATO (over phone): Mr. Donovan,
it's Principal Amato.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.125
There's been an incident here
at the school

21:19.208 --> 21:21.375
involving your son, Conor.

21:21.458 --> 21:22.667
Your wife is on her way.

21:22.750 --> 21:23.083
(panting)
Is he all right?

21:23.166 --> 21:24.667
He's fine,

21:24.750 --> 21:25.583
but he is in serious trouble.

21:25.667 --> 21:27.917
You need to come in here
right away.

21:29.250 --> 21:30.500
(screams, grunts)

21:30.583 --> 21:33.208
(tires screeching,
engine revving)

21:33.291 --> 21:35.208
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

21:35.291 --> 21:36.375
(panting)

21:36.458 --> 21:37.458
(crying)

21:37.542 --> 21:39.291
Shut up.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.709
(tires screech)

21:42.083 --> 21:44.250
(gasps)

21:44.333 --> 21:45.500
(gun cocks)

21:45.583 --> 21:46.041
(panting)

21:46.125 --> 21:48.709
Get out of the car.

21:53.041 --> 21:54.166
You want to go
onstage tonight

21:54.250 --> 21:55.583
and have a chance to win?

21:55.667 --> 21:57.166
Or do you want
to be the girl

21:57.250 --> 21:58.542
that got fucked
by Deonte Brown

21:58.625 --> 22:00.709
and shot by his wife?

22:00.792 --> 22:02.917
Huh?
(crying)

22:03.000 --> 22:04.500
(mutters):
I gotta go.

22:11.917 --> 22:13.250
(car door closes)

22:13.333 --> 22:14.500
(panting)

22:16.041 --> 22:17.458
All right, wait here.

22:17.542 --> 22:20.083
No, I want to go
to Cedar's right now.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.250
Do what I tell you,

22:21.333 --> 22:22.500
you'll be there
in a few minutes.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.834
(screaming)

22:27.917 --> 22:30.125
(gasps)

22:30.208 --> 22:31.208
Listen to me.
(whining):
No!

22:31.291 --> 22:33.250
You were mugged, you understand?

22:33.333 --> 22:34.417
Big guy with a hoodie,

22:34.500 --> 22:35.750
you didn't see his face,
all right?

22:37.542 --> 22:40.041
No, please don't leave me.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.417
Hey, how you doing?

22:45.500 --> 22:48.291
How do you think I'm doing?

22:48.375 --> 22:49.750
I'm fucking dying!

22:49.834 --> 22:51.709
Calm down,
take a deep breath.

22:51.792 --> 22:52.125
(gasping)
Okay?

22:52.208 --> 22:53.417
(phone clicks)

22:53.500 --> 22:55.083
Yeah, hi. I'd like
to report a mugging.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.208
A girl's just been shot,

22:57.291 --> 22:58.458
and she's bleeding,
so please hurry.

22:58.542 --> 22:59.834
Uh, it's at the park
(grunts)

22:59.917 --> 23:01.959
at North Beverly and Sunset.
(crying)

23:02.041 --> 23:03.208
(car engine starts)

23:03.291 --> 23:04.625
Thank you.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.000
You're a good singer.
I've seen you perform.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.542
You watch the show?

23:08.625 --> 23:09.792
Oh, yeah, I love it.

23:09.875 --> 23:11.750
And I think you
got a real shot, too.

23:11.834 --> 23:13.417
But if you
don't follow the story

23:13.500 --> 23:14.750
I'm about to tell you...

23:14.834 --> 23:17.542
we're gonna shoot you again.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.542
(Reggaeton music playing)

23:26.458 --> 23:28.917
Gracias.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.417
I was born in Veracruz.

23:30.500 --> 23:33.125
Near Coatzacoalcos.

23:33.208 --> 23:33.709
Do you know where that is?

23:36.375 --> 23:38.208
I was raised by Catholics.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.834
By the time I was ten, though,

23:39.917 --> 23:41.458
they figured out
that I had dyslexia.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.959
Ay, como chingas.
It was so crazy.

23:45.041 --> 23:46.041
(laughing):
Hey, boy!

23:46.125 --> 23:47.375
Hey, yo!

23:47.458 --> 23:49.542
My... my boy.

23:49.625 --> 23:51.834
(laughing)
Good to see you, Pop.

23:51.917 --> 23:53.000
You look good.
Yeah.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.000
You ready?
Hell, yeah.

23:55.083 --> 23:55.834
Come on, Pop,
I stay ready.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.291
So, how big is this guy?
Is he big?

23:57.375 --> 24:00.125
He's a Mexican.
How big could he be?

24:00.208 --> 24:01.166
(both laughing)

24:01.250 --> 24:02.959
Don't worry about it.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.041
Here, have a seat.

24:05.125 --> 24:06.208
Hola.
Hi.

24:06.291 --> 24:07.291
Sit. Eat.

24:07.375 --> 24:09.500
We got fresh red snapper.

24:09.583 --> 24:10.542
What's your name again,
sweetheart?

24:10.625 --> 24:11.500
Como chingas, Mickey.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.125
How many times
I got to tell you?

24:13.208 --> 24:14.792
Jazmin.
MICKEY: This is Daryll.

24:15.375 --> 24:17.500
Whoo.
My son.

24:17.583 --> 24:18.875
Wow. This looks great.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.125
So, I'll see you
and I'll see you.

24:21.208 --> 24:22.667
Here you go.
MAN: Mickey...

24:22.750 --> 24:24.458
I was just looking
for you, man.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.041
Oh, yeah? What for?

24:26.125 --> 24:27.792
Too late.

24:27.875 --> 24:29.041
I want the room another month.

24:29.125 --> 24:31.291
How much do I owe you?

24:31.375 --> 24:32.166
Uh, $300 for the room
and $100 for the puta.

24:32.250 --> 24:33.333
Don't insult the lady.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.125
I'll knock your
fucking teeth out.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.333
You know how much

24:37.417 --> 24:39.417
an ass like that
would cost in L.A.?

24:40.792 --> 24:42.625
Boop.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.375
You'll help me out, kid?

24:47.333 --> 24:47.875
(sighs)

24:47.959 --> 24:51.333
Um...

24:51.417 --> 24:53.875
Yeah, I mean, uh...
I'll see how much I got.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.917
This is...
Let's see. There we go.

24:57.291 --> 24:58.083
There.
I'll give you the rest

24:58.166 --> 25:00.250
after the fight tonight.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.083
(speaks Spanish)

25:02.166 --> 25:04.375
(grumbles)

25:05.291 --> 25:07.500
How are the boys?

25:08.667 --> 25:09.041
You know, they're all right.

25:09.125 --> 25:11.000
They miss me?

25:14.500 --> 25:15.792
You seen Ray?

25:15.875 --> 25:16.792
Mm-mm.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.291
Are you the fighter?

25:21.375 --> 25:22.750
Yes, I am.

25:22.834 --> 25:24.125
You gonna come tonight?

25:24.208 --> 25:25.750
Oh, you want my autograph?

25:25.834 --> 25:27.458
Yes.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.875
El Negro?
What kind of shit is this?

25:29.959 --> 25:31.625
Pop, they're calling me
negro down here.

25:31.709 --> 25:33.917
It's El Negro.

25:34.000 --> 25:34.875
It's Mexican. It's...

25:34.959 --> 25:37.166
It's different.
Nah, it's
fucked-up.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.083
You're fine.
No, it's fucked-up.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.166
What's your name,
little man?

25:41.250 --> 25:42.625
My name is Noe.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.041
Noe?

25:44.125 --> 25:46.125
Well, I'm Daryll Donovan.

25:46.208 --> 25:47.709
Black Irish.

25:49.375 --> 25:51.625
Here you go, homie.

25:51.709 --> 25:52.792
Thank you.
You're welcome.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.375
Here.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.250
Have a drink. Relax.

26:02.542 --> 26:03.917
Relax? Pop, I'm
about to have a fight

26:04.000 --> 26:07.625
in a couple hours, and you're
offering me a fucking drink?

26:08.709 --> 26:11.125
Good point. (laughs)
(chuckles)

26:14.917 --> 26:16.875
I made my dad
leave my apartment.

26:19.917 --> 26:21.083
Living on my own again.

26:21.166 --> 26:23.709
Like a grown-up.

26:25.583 --> 26:29.542
It ain't all roses
and rainbows.

26:31.458 --> 26:35.417
Sometimes I get lonely.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.125
The good part is
I'm not around

26:38.208 --> 26:40.208
his porn no more.
(short chuckle)

26:40.291 --> 26:42.208
No. No more booze.

26:42.291 --> 26:44.417
No more coke.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.625
No more hookers.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.667
I... I got a job interview
at a bike shop today.

26:52.750 --> 26:54.417
You'd be good at that, Bunchy.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.250
You look good, Bunch.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.333
I like the tie.

27:01.208 --> 27:02.709
Thanks.

27:02.792 --> 27:03.959
Thanks, guys.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.250
(quiet applause)

27:09.667 --> 27:10.750
(exhales)

27:18.834 --> 27:20.166
RAY:
You trace the call?

27:20.250 --> 27:21.291
AVI (over phone):
Yeah.

27:21.375 --> 27:22.542
My guy from AT&T

27:22.625 --> 27:26.333
says that Daryll was driving
past a cell phone tower in Baja.

27:26.417 --> 27:27.542
Heading south.

27:27.625 --> 27:29.125
All right. Stay on it.

27:29.208 --> 27:30.500
I will.

27:30.583 --> 27:31.834
Av...

27:31.917 --> 27:33.125
Yeah?

27:33.208 --> 27:34.792
You feeling okay?

27:34.875 --> 27:35.166
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.250
I'm fine.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.625
I'm healing nicely.

27:38.709 --> 27:40.917
Thanks.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.917
We'll put it
on your account, Ray.

27:50.000 --> 27:50.834
Thanks, doll.

28:15.250 --> 28:17.959
Hi.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.875
I'm Stan.

28:21.792 --> 28:23.667
Bunchy.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.125
That's a great tie.

28:25.208 --> 28:28.041
Thanks.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.709
I'm new to all this.

28:37.375 --> 28:40.458
I wish I could put my abuse
behind me the way that you have.

28:41.875 --> 28:44.333
Yeah?

28:44.417 --> 28:46.959
I didn't put it behind me
so much as I buried it.

28:50.542 --> 28:53.500
I really connected with you.

28:57.041 --> 28:57.542
Do you want to maybe...

28:57.625 --> 28:59.792
grab a bite to eat?

28:59.875 --> 29:01.625
Talk about it?

29:01.709 --> 29:04.291
Aw... nah, I...

29:04.375 --> 29:05.333
got to get to my job interview.

29:05.417 --> 29:07.959
Oh, y... (laughs)

29:08.041 --> 29:09.125
Um...

29:09.208 --> 29:11.375
Well, uh, maybe another time.

29:11.458 --> 29:12.792
Yeah.

29:12.875 --> 29:14.375
Maybe.
Okay.

29:14.458 --> 29:17.333
Hey, good luck.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.000
I really like bikes.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.917
Anything on two
wheels, I can fix.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.875
Handlebars, gears,
you know, doesn't matter.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.542
I can fix anything
in this store.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.542
Brendan, there's a blank here.

29:58.625 --> 29:59.208
Who's your previous employer?

29:59.291 --> 30:01.542
Uh...

30:01.625 --> 30:02.291
Uh, The Boston Globe.

30:02.375 --> 30:04.959
Oh, really?

30:05.041 --> 30:06.208
That's impressive.

30:06.291 --> 30:06.667
What did you do there?

30:06.750 --> 30:08.375
I delivered it.

30:11.500 --> 30:12.625
(quiet chuckle)

30:13.917 --> 30:15.542
AMATO:
There were words exchanged.

30:15.625 --> 30:19.000
The other boy knocked Conor's
cell phone out of his hands.

30:19.083 --> 30:22.750
Conor retaliated by pushing
the boy down a flight of stairs.

30:23.875 --> 30:25.166
So the other kid
started it?

30:29.875 --> 30:32.583
He has a broken
collar bone, Ray.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.000
We have a zero-tolerance

30:34.083 --> 30:37.291
policy for violence here
at Calabasas High School.

30:37.375 --> 30:39.417
This is a very
serious situation.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.041
We have to be prepared now
for a potential lawsuit

30:42.125 --> 30:44.000
or even a criminal
investigation.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.542
Five days, Con?

30:48.625 --> 30:50.625
What am I supposed to do?

30:50.709 --> 30:52.583
Stay home and babysit?

30:52.667 --> 30:54.250
I have a life, too.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.417
(sighs)

30:56.500 --> 30:58.208
Come here.

31:09.375 --> 31:10.208
We'll take care of this.

31:10.291 --> 31:12.834
All right?

31:12.917 --> 31:14.750
We're gonna call
the kid's parents.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.542
Go over to their house
and we'll apologize.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.500
For what? He threw my phone
on the ground and broke it.

31:19.583 --> 31:21.542
You pushed him
down the stairs.

31:21.625 --> 31:23.375
We can get sued.

31:23.458 --> 31:26.625
Really?
Yeah, really.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.083
It's all right.

31:31.166 --> 31:32.792
We'll sort it out
tonight.

31:32.875 --> 31:34.625
Get in the car.

31:34.709 --> 31:37.125
Sweetheart.

31:37.208 --> 31:38.291
Thank you.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.166
For what?

31:40.250 --> 31:42.125
For coming here
to deal with this.

31:42.208 --> 31:44.291
I know you're busy.

31:44.375 --> 31:45.834
Nothing's
more important.

31:45.917 --> 31:48.792
I'll see you later.
(phone rings)

31:56.750 --> 32:00.166
I need you, Raymond.

32:00.250 --> 32:02.917
(applause, whistling)

32:03.000 --> 32:05.208
(speaking Spanish)

32:08.291 --> 32:10.583
(speaking Spanish)

32:10.667 --> 32:13.291
...Hollywood, California,

32:13.375 --> 32:16.125
Daryll "El Negro" Donovan!

32:16.208 --> 32:18.083
(booing, applause)

32:28.083 --> 32:30.291
The crowd is gonna be
against you on this one.

32:30.375 --> 32:31.542
You got to use that shit

32:31.625 --> 32:32.792
to fuel your fire.
Yeah.

32:32.875 --> 32:36.375
Make 'em remember El Negro. Huh?

32:36.458 --> 32:37.917
Okay, yeah.
All right, breathe.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.375
(emcee speaking Spanish)

32:43.458 --> 32:48.917
...Miguel "La Fuerza" Montago!
(cheering, applause)

32:49.000 --> 32:50.250
(trumpets play a tune)

33:09.125 --> 33:12.583
You kidding me, Mickey?
That guy's fucking huge.

33:12.667 --> 33:15.500
All right, he's a little
bit bigger than I thought.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.375
But who the fuck
trained you?

33:17.458 --> 33:18.250
Keep dancing,

33:18.333 --> 33:21.375
keep moving.
Stick him when you can.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.125
You can take
this cocksucker.

33:25.834 --> 33:28.500
Look at me.
You can take him.

33:28.583 --> 33:30.458
(referee speaking Spanish)

33:42.458 --> 33:46.375
(referee speaking Spanish)

33:48.667 --> 33:50.542
(applause, whistling)

33:54.583 --> 33:56.417
(spits)

34:00.041 --> 34:00.583
Mind over matter.

34:00.667 --> 34:03.625

35:26.917 --> 35:29.417
He works for you, right?

35:29.500 --> 35:31.959
I hire his company
from time to time.

35:32.041 --> 35:34.792
What kind of, uh, business
do you hire him for?

35:34.875 --> 35:36.625
Well, he's also a client,

35:36.709 --> 35:38.709
which means I can't
discuss anything about him.

35:38.792 --> 35:40.250
Right. I see.

35:40.333 --> 35:43.375

also a client?

35:43.458 --> 35:46.375

35:46.458 --> 35:46.875
I don't know
anything about him.

35:46.959 --> 35:48.166
So I guess, uh, you

35:48.250 --> 35:51.083
couldn't tell me
where he is, then?
No.

35:51.166 --> 35:52.750
Is there an investigation
I should know about?

35:52.834 --> 35:53.875
Not at this time.

35:53.959 --> 35:55.041
I don't know. I just...

35:55.125 --> 35:57.542
wanted this to be
an informal chat.

35:57.625 --> 35:58.709
Oh, look.

35:58.792 --> 36:00.709
Here's your boy now.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.333
He's not my boy.
How dare you.

36:03.417 --> 36:06.000
You need to find your
father. You got, uh...

36:06.083 --> 36:06.542
24 hours.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.333
Mr. Goldman.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.083
Pleasure chatting with you.

36:21.125 --> 36:21.875
What'd you tell him?

36:21.959 --> 36:24.208
I didn't tell him anything.

36:24.291 --> 36:25.834
But where were you?

36:25.917 --> 36:27.250
Why is he looking for Mickey?

36:27.333 --> 36:28.709
I thought all
that was over.

36:28.792 --> 36:30.083
What does he want?

36:30.166 --> 36:31.291
Relax, Ezra.

36:31.375 --> 36:32.750
I can't relax.

36:32.834 --> 36:33.667
Don't you know what's at stake?

that means, Ezra.

36:43.750 --> 36:45.750
"To repair the world."

36:45.834 --> 36:47.583
We must repair
the world, Raymond.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.208
Right.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.709
The Ruth Goldman Cancer Center

36:52.792 --> 36:55.333
is the most important thing
in my life.

36:55.417 --> 36:56.792
Yeah, I know.

36:56.875 --> 36:59.709
While I was ill last year,
a lot of people took advantage.

36:59.792 --> 37:01.041
They stopped digging
at the site, Raymond.

37:01.125 --> 37:03.792
We're at least
$50 million short.

37:03.875 --> 37:05.417
You're gonna have to help me
make good on these pledges.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.792
It's gonna be the toughest
thing we've ever had to do.

37:08.875 --> 37:09.875
I need your help.

37:09.959 --> 37:11.333
I know you do.

37:11.417 --> 37:14.333
I can't spend the rest
of my life in prison.

37:14.417 --> 37:17.667
Do you have it all
under control, Raymond?

37:17.750 --> 37:20.542
Yeah. Yeah.

37:20.625 --> 37:22.291
I love Sylvia Plath.

37:22.375 --> 37:24.166
Sylvia Plath was a freak.

37:24.250 --> 37:25.792
She should have
been on Lexapro.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.125
She had no one.

37:27.208 --> 37:29.250
I mean, her husband
fell in love with someone else.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.959
And she wrote all
the poems in Ariel,

37:31.041 --> 37:32.834
and it was so cold
that winter.

37:32.917 --> 37:34.208
She should've moved.

37:34.291 --> 37:35.291
She couldn't. You know,

37:35.375 --> 37:36.625
she had two little kids.

37:36.709 --> 37:38.083
She was so brave.

37:38.166 --> 37:41.125
You're a freak, Bridg.
