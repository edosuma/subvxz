Uh, you might want to check

02:18.951 --> 02:20.188

02:20.222 --> 02:20.923
No, no, no!

02:20.956 --> 02:21.692
Don't do that.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.862
Can't you read?

02:22.895 --> 02:24.900
He's the guy that rips it off.

02:42.043 --> 02:42.912

02:49.895 --> 02:52.569

02:52.602 --> 02:54.741
But we can still go back

02:54.775 --> 02:55.877
through the power of

02:55.910 --> 02:56.746
imagination.

03:26.326 --> 03:28.365
Prizes include a new car or a

03:28.398 --> 03:30.704

03:30.737 --> 03:31.974
At wong burger, when it's

03:32.007 --> 03:35.082

03:37.153 --> 03:37.989

03:38.022 --> 03:39.626
I knew he said that!

03:39.659 --> 03:40.662
What? About the teriyaki

03:40.696 --> 03:41.564
fries?

03:48.515 --> 03:50.052
Oh, my--Carl, hide.

03:50.085 --> 03:51.689
I ain't hidin' from nobody.

03:51.723 --> 03:52.358
Who is it?

03:53.494 --> 03:55.132
I don't know, but they got

03:55.165 --> 03:56.702
sharp hooks and long necklaces

03:56.736 --> 03:58.139
made out of dicks.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.075
Uh, ok. Just to be safe,

03:59.108 --> 04:00.779
I'm--i'm gonna hide down here.

04:00.812 --> 04:02.189
Carl, in here.

04:02.222 --> 04:04.127
No one won't never look in here.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.531
Don't no one never want to get

04:05.564 --> 04:06.701
near here.

04:06.734 --> 04:08.538
You, uh, you sure about this?

04:08.571 --> 04:11.011
Oh, just do it.

04:11.044 --> 04:12.280
Aah!

04:12.314 --> 04:13.517
Whoops! My bad.

04:13.551 --> 04:14.686
I told y'all this closet's

04:14.720 --> 04:15.623
not to be opened.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.458
It is a horrible, horrible

04:16.491 --> 04:17.260
place in there.

04:17.293 --> 04:18.730
Well, there's knob there.

04:18.764 --> 04:19.464
Why do you think I put the

04:19.498 --> 04:20.233
sign there?

04:20.267 --> 04:21.170
You think I was being cute?

04:21.202 --> 04:22.205
I don't know.

04:22.239 --> 04:24.044
Ding-dong the dick is dead,

04:24.077 --> 04:25.079
Carl!

04:25.112 --> 04:26.149
Oh. I'm gonna go in--i'm in

04:26.182 --> 04:27.919
this cabinet.

04:27.953 --> 04:28.956
Ahem. Can I help you?

04:28.989 --> 04:30.560
Yes, you can!

04:35.772 --> 04:37.042
Uh, you're from wong's,

04:37.075 --> 04:37.711
aren't you?

04:37.744 --> 04:38.679
Yes, I am.

04:38.713 --> 04:41.119
So who's gonna get their dick

04:41.152 --> 04:43.893
ripped off tonight?

04:43.926 --> 04:44.728
Well, he ain't here.

04:44.761 --> 04:46.064
Who's not here?

04:46.099 --> 04:48.204
Carl, the guy that it ain't

04:48.237 --> 04:49.206
happening to.

04:49.239 --> 04:50.643
So someone won.

04:50.676 --> 04:51.445
I don't even know what

04:51.478 --> 04:52.180
you're talking about.

04:52.214 --> 04:53.216
Nobody won anything here.

04:53.249 --> 04:54.853
Mind if I look around?

04:55.588 --> 04:57.961
Yes, I do mind.

04:57.994 --> 04:59.732
Oh. Scratch off and win.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.179
Every cup's a winner!

05:02.212 --> 05:03.849
1 in 3 chance of getting

05:03.883 --> 05:05.319
your dick ripped off.

05:05.352 --> 05:06.355
Dude, look. You're wasting

05:06.389 --> 05:07.492
your time because no one won

05:07.525 --> 05:08.427
that.

05:08.460 --> 05:09.530
Oh. Well, that's not what he

05:09.563 --> 05:10.465
said.

05:10.499 --> 05:11.735
Who won it, little man?

05:11.768 --> 05:13.072
'Cause someone's dick is

05:13.106 --> 05:15.645
coming with me tonight!

05:15.678 --> 05:17.450
Next door and shut up!

05:17.483 --> 05:18.184
shake!

05:18.219 --> 05:18.920
I'm trying to watch this

05:18.953 --> 05:19.722
show.

05:19.755 --> 05:20.758
Will you shut the hell up?

05:20.791 --> 05:21.527
God!

05:21.560 --> 05:23.866
Good-bye.

05:23.899 --> 05:25.637
Carl, come on out.

05:25.670 --> 05:26.572
are they gone?

05:26.605 --> 05:28.377
Yeah. To your house.

05:28.410 --> 05:29.179
They're gonna turn it inside

05:29.212 --> 05:30.683
out, Carl, until he gets ahold

05:30.716 --> 05:32.219
of your dick.

05:32.253 --> 05:33.623
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!

05:33.657 --> 05:34.525
He's over here!

05:34.559 --> 05:35.227
Where'd you go?

05:35.261 --> 05:36.731
Would you shut up?

05:36.765 --> 05:37.567
Apparently, Carl, when you

05:37.600 --> 05:38.803
bought that medium drink, you

05:38.836 --> 05:40.173
entered a binding contract.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.242
It enables them to rip off your

05:41.276 --> 05:42.044
dick.

05:42.078 --> 05:42.746
Oh, no!

05:42.780 --> 05:43.682
Yeah.

05:43.715 --> 05:44.617
And there's really nothing I

05:44.650 --> 05:46.072
can do about it.

05:54.308 --> 05:55.176
Hello?

05:55.211 --> 05:56.346
Did you get the dick yet?

05:56.379 --> 05:57.482
We're working on it,

05:57.516 --> 06:00.891
Mr. Wong Burger.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.469
Finally tonight, I will have

06:02.502 --> 06:04.540
enough dicks to complete the

06:04.574 --> 06:06.244
dickship and return to dick

06:06.278 --> 06:07.180
planet.

06:07.213 --> 06:11.156
Yes, Mr. Wong Burger.

06:11.190 --> 06:11.925
How we gonna get out of

06:11.958 --> 06:13.128
this, fry man?

06:13.161 --> 06:15.266
Well, I have an idea, but

06:15.301 --> 06:16.770
it's not very good.

06:16.804 --> 06:17.639
Those dicks, will you,

06:17.672 --> 06:18.642
please, somebody stack them

06:18.675 --> 06:19.311
better?

06:19.344 --> 06:20.346
The dicks won't hold

06:20.379 --> 06:22.318
together, Mr. Wong Burger!

06:22.351 --> 06:23.220
We're gonna have to wrap

06:23.253 --> 06:25.258
these dicks with something,

06:25.291 --> 06:27.998
maybe with a--a dick.

06:28.032 --> 06:28.900
Are you telling me that I

06:28.934 --> 06:30.739
don't know dick?

06:30.772 --> 06:32.108
If anyone knows how to build a

06:32.142 --> 06:33.880
ship out of dicks, it is me!

06:33.913 --> 06:35.918
Yes, Mr. Wong Burger.

06:35.952 --> 06:37.556
because I am king dick!

06:37.589 --> 06:38.925
We're missing a dick for the

06:38.959 --> 06:40.229
nose cone!

06:40.263 --> 06:41.331
The dick ship will never

06:41.365 --> 06:42.802
hold together.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.707
What's taking them so long?

06:44.740 --> 06:45.776
He entered a binding legal

06:45.809 --> 06:46.945
contract the moment he took a

06:46.979 --> 06:47.747
sip.

06:47.781 --> 06:49.619
You don't think they're...

06:49.652 --> 06:50.855
Dicking around over

06:50.889 --> 06:52.192
there, do you?

06:52.225 --> 06:53.328
I doubt it.

06:53.361 --> 06:54.163
They're professional dick

06:54.197 --> 06:55.567
hunters.

06:55.601 --> 06:59.878
They crave dick, as we all do.

06:59.912 --> 07:00.814
you can get up now, Carl.

07:00.847 --> 07:01.616
I think we're done.

07:01.649 --> 07:02.892
Oh, man.

07:02.925 --> 07:03.761
Feel all right?

07:03.794 --> 07:04.529
Where'd you get these

07:04.563 --> 07:05.198
painkillers?

07:05.231 --> 07:06.033
They're awesome.

07:06.067 --> 07:07.236
Yeah. Maybe you should just,

07:07.270 --> 07:11.413
like, use pills forever.

07:11.446 --> 07:13.050
Yeah. You're right.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.256
This was a, uh, very bad idea.

07:15.290 --> 07:17.696
Hey, Carlina, wow!

07:17.729 --> 07:18.664
Oh. I get it.

07:18.698 --> 07:20.135
Yeah. You put me under, dressed

07:20.168 --> 07:21.538
me like a woman, took pictures

07:21.571 --> 07:22.441
of me.

07:22.474 --> 07:23.644
Laugh's on me, huh?

07:23.677 --> 07:24.679
Well, no, Carl.

07:24.713 --> 07:27.185
See--heh--uh, you're not just

07:27.220 --> 07:29.959
dressed like a woman.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.396
Oh, do go on, please.

07:31.430 --> 07:32.298
Well, it's pretty simple

07:32.332 --> 07:33.034
really.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.270
I removed your dick so no one

07:34.303 --> 07:36.476
will have no need to remove it.

07:36.509 --> 07:37.545
So the giant blood stain is,

07:37.578 --> 07:39.851
uh--what is that, me having my

07:39.884 --> 07:40.920
period, I guess?

07:40.954 --> 07:41.689
Heh heh!

07:41.722 --> 07:43.125
It could be, or it could be

07:43.159 --> 07:44.095
just the spot where I snipped

07:44.128 --> 07:46.433
your dick off.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.269
You're taking this pretty

07:47.303 --> 07:49.107
good, Carl.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.377
Kudos.

07:50.410 --> 07:51.212
Seems like this whole thing

07:51.245 --> 07:52.282
kind of defeats the purpose,

07:52.315 --> 07:53.050
you know?

07:53.084 --> 07:53.986
Yep.

07:54.019 --> 07:55.289
And what I just did was a very

07:55.322 --> 07:56.158
bad idea.

07:56.192 --> 07:56.994
You think, uh, maybe I

07:57.027 --> 07:58.698
could, uh, have my dick back?

07:58.731 --> 07:59.767
Oh, wait. You know what?

07:59.801 --> 08:01.605
Maybe you should keep my dick

08:01.638 --> 08:02.513
so you could, uh,

08:02.547 --> 08:04.686
hump yourself!

08:04.719 --> 08:05.755
Technically, that would not

08:05.789 --> 08:07.493
be, uh, doing yourself, just

08:07.526 --> 08:08.395
for the record.

08:08.428 --> 08:09.731
Hey, Carl. Look at that.

08:09.765 --> 08:11.069
You can still pick your dick

08:11.102 --> 08:11.904
out of the garbage.

08:11.937 --> 08:12.572
Is that it?

08:12.606 --> 08:13.508
Is that mine?

08:13.541 --> 08:14.210
Of course it is.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.345
It's got that curve to the left.

08:15.379 --> 08:17.417
No, no, no!

08:17.451 --> 08:19.122
Why'd you let them take it?

08:19.155 --> 08:20.224
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

08:20.258 --> 08:21.260
I have a better plan.

08:21.294 --> 08:22.664
Meatwad, you got a big dick,

08:22.698 --> 08:23.432
right?

08:23.466 --> 08:24.803
Oh, yeah. Huge, but I need

08:24.836 --> 08:26.808
it for tonight.

08:26.841 --> 08:28.278
But it's detachable, so that

08:28.312 --> 08:29.247
helps us.

08:29.280 --> 08:29.949
No!

08:29.982 --> 08:31.820
No way I'm having a dick made

08:31.853 --> 08:32.587
of hamburger.

08:32.621 --> 08:33.625
I'm not giving it to you.

08:33.658 --> 08:35.361
Good because I don't need it

08:35.395 --> 08:37.366
because I'm huge between the

08:37.400 --> 08:38.236
legs!

08:38.269 --> 08:39.505
Who wants to see my dick?

08:42.547 --> 08:43.482
see?

08:43.515 --> 08:44.718
Dick Nixon.

08:44.753 --> 08:46.089
Old Tricky Dick.

08:46.122 --> 08:47.793
I have another idea.

08:47.826 --> 08:48.863
All the dicks are polished,

08:48.896 --> 08:49.698
sir.

08:49.731 --> 08:50.733
Probably needs just a couple

08:50.767 --> 08:54.209
more dick rotors, maybe a dick

08:54.242 --> 08:55.312
wheel or two.

08:55.345 --> 08:57.284
Yes, Mr. Wong Burger!

08:57.317 --> 08:59.589
and, uh, do we have to fuel

08:59.623 --> 09:00.391
it up with some dicks?

09:00.425 --> 09:02.029
Yes. We got a full tank of

09:02.062 --> 09:03.071
dicks.

09:03.104 --> 09:05.310
Full tank. Good, good, good.

09:05.344 --> 09:06.813
Wall-to-wall dick carpeting?

09:06.848 --> 09:08.417
Yes. You've mentioned that,

09:08.451 --> 09:10.055
Mr. Wong Burger.

09:10.089 --> 09:11.058
Agh! Dicks!

09:11.091 --> 09:12.896
Everywhere I turn, it's dicks!

09:12.929 --> 09:14.934
Intruders!

09:14.968 --> 09:16.003
Stop them!

09:16.036 --> 09:21.851
Close the dick gate!

09:21.885 --> 09:22.753
What are you doing touching

09:22.787 --> 09:23.589
my dicks?

09:23.622 --> 09:24.424
You can't just run around,

09:24.457 --> 09:25.795
ripping off people's dicks to

09:25.828 --> 09:27.365
make a giant dickship.

09:27.399 --> 09:28.868
I have an advanced degree in

09:28.902 --> 09:29.838
dicknology!

09:29.871 --> 09:31.409
You're a madman, Wong Burger!

09:31.442 --> 09:32.645
This ship will never fly.

09:32.678 --> 09:34.316
Well, how else am I supposed

09:34.349 --> 09:36.655
to get home?

09:36.688 --> 09:42.536
Call someone to pick you up.

09:42.569 --> 09:45.109
I will.

09:45.143 --> 09:46.512
Hey. Hey. You don't know

09:46.546 --> 09:47.549
which one of these is Carl's.

09:47.582 --> 09:48.251
It don't matter.

09:48.284 --> 09:49.086
Just get one.

09:49.119 --> 09:50.088
You grab one.

09:50.121 --> 09:52.494
I'm not touching those dicks.

09:52.527 --> 09:53.429
Hopefully, the swelling in

09:53.464 --> 09:55.368
your chest should go down once

09:55.401 --> 09:57.273
the testosterone fully

09:57.306 --> 09:58.642
circulates around your body.

09:58.676 --> 09:59.779
Ohh.

09:59.812 --> 10:01.048
What about my voice?

10:01.082 --> 10:02.018
Oh. I added a third testicle

10:02.051 --> 10:03.762
to speed up the process.

10:03.795 --> 10:05.800
I'll have to cut it out later.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.037
Otherwise, you'd just go insane

10:07.070 --> 10:07.940
with rage.

10:07.973 --> 10:08.908
Whoa! Check it out!

10:08.942 --> 10:10.245
Somebody's suing Wong Burger!

10:10.278 --> 10:11.314
Wong Burger could not be

10:11.348 --> 10:12.885
reached for comment as he left

10:12.918 --> 10:14.790
the press conference in a giant

10:14.823 --> 10:17.363
spaceship made of dicks, which

10:17.396 --> 10:19.167
crashed into a building made of

10:19.201 --> 10:21.273
dicks.

10:21.306 --> 10:22.241
Apparently that's what the

10:22.275 --> 10:23.612
building was made of, if you've

10:23.645 --> 10:24.681
ever seen it from the

10:24.714 --> 10:25.717
interstate.

10:25.750 --> 10:29.426
Clearly, the act of a total...

10:29.459 --> 10:33.603
Total, uh--you know, a total,

10:33.637 --> 10:35.909
Uh...

10:35.942 --> 10:36.811
Uh, what's the word I'm looking

10:36.844 --> 10:37.714
for here?

10:37.747 --> 10:40.153
Uh...Uh...

10:40.186 --> 10:41.323
Total, uh...

10:41.356 --> 10:42.158
While you guys are busy

10:42.191 --> 10:44.463
wasting, I found a perfectly

10:44.497 --> 10:47.103
good hot dog in the trash

10:47.137 --> 10:49.877
sitting right on top of two

10:49.910 --> 10:52.350
soggy walnuts.

10:52.383 --> 10:53.519
Mm.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.622
Still in the wrapper.

10:54.656 --> 10:55.825
I mean, there's hair on them,

10:55.859 --> 10:57.195
but, hey, a little brush off.

10:57.228 --> 10:58.699
Delicious.

10:58.732 --> 10:59.869
Mm.

10:59.902 --> 11:01.840
This tastes like blood.

11:01.874 --> 11:02.882
Wow!

11:02.916 --> 11:05.088
This hot dog.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.358
I think the gum is blood

11:06.391 --> 11:07.995
flavored.

11:08.029 --> 11:09.967
Wait.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.738
Yeah. Definitely blood flavored.
