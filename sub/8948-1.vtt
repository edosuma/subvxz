00:29.696 --> 00:33.032
There was a time when
energy was a dirty word.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.035
When turning on your
lights was a hard choice.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.536
Cities in brownout.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.787
Food shortages.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.873
Cars burning fuel to run.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.875
But that was the past.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.251
Where are we now?

00:44.335 --> 00:46.754
How do we make the
world so much better?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.589
Make deserts bloom?

00:49.883 --> 00:53.927
Right now, we're the largest producer
of fusion energy in the world.

00:54.012 --> 00:56.305
The energy of the sun
trapped in rock,

00:56.389 --> 00:59.641
harvested by machine from
the far side of the moon.

01:00.477 --> 01:03.520
Today, we deliver enough
clean-burning helium-3

01:03.605 --> 01:07.149
to supply the energy needs
of nearly 70% of the planet.

01:08.651 --> 01:09.735
Who'd have thought?

01:09.819 --> 01:11.695
All the energy we ever needed,

01:11.780 --> 01:13.655
right above our heads.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.868
The power of the moon.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.912
The power of our future.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.780
Rock and roll.
8:32 Pacific Time.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.824
All Harvesters running smoothly.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.325
Readouts are as follows.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.579
Matthew, 14.6 miles.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.124
Mark, 16.8 miles. I...

02:55.758 --> 02:58.802
Hey, Gerty. Gerty. We gotta...

02:59.137 --> 03:01.138
Good morning, Sam.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.806
We got a live one on Mark.

03:02.891 --> 03:04.683
I'm gonna go out now
and rope her in.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.143
Okay, Sam.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.825
I want chocolate.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.329
I think you're sweet enough.
You don't need chocolate.

04:17.798 --> 04:27.391
Searching for long-range comms.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.771
Signal failure on
long-range comms.

05:44.927 --> 05:49.931
Sam Bell reporting to Central.
10:14 Pacific Time.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.478
I've got a full container
of helium-3 ready to roll.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.314
By the time this message reaches
you, it should be in transit.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.858
Otherwise, everything
running smoothly.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.070
How are things down there?

06:04.405 --> 06:06.156
You guys been to any

06:07.283 --> 06:09.201
good parties or anything?

06:09.285 --> 06:12.746
Oh, thanks for the
football feed.

06:12.830 --> 06:16.458
It almost felt live... Almost.

06:17.585 --> 06:20.670
But three years is a
long haul, you know.

06:20.755 --> 06:25.175
It's way, way, way,
way, way too long.

06:25.802 --> 06:29.221
I'm talking to myself
on a regular basis.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.807
So...

06:32.308 --> 06:34.893
Time to go home, you
know what I mean?

06:35.728 --> 06:37.646
That's it. Over and out.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.315
Rock and roll. God
bless America.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.752
I can do that for you, Sam.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.759
God damn it. I said I got it.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.886
Why don't you listen to me?

07:18.479 --> 07:20.939
Ready for launch.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.380
Sam, is everything okay?

07:48.885 --> 07:50.552
- Sam?
- What?

07:51.512 --> 07:53.680
You don't seem like
yourself today.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.098
- Has something happened?
- You know...

07:55.183 --> 07:58.518
Can you turn that off? Please.
Jesus Christ.

08:01.355 --> 08:04.065
Sam, it might help you
to talk about it.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.447
Gerty, have you heard anything new
about anyone fixing Lunar Sat?

08:10.531 --> 08:11.573
No, Sam.

08:11.657 --> 08:15.994
What I understand is it's fairly low on
the company's priority list right now.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.914
You tell them to sort that out,
you know what I'm talking about?

08:18.998 --> 08:22.000
That's not... I've
only got two weeks,

08:22.084 --> 08:25.629
but it's not fair to whoever
is coming up here next.

08:25.713 --> 08:29.216
I will, Sam. Do you want me to
finish cutting your hair later?

08:29.300 --> 08:31.593
No, come on, let's finish this.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.847
Another one of those headaches.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.558
Gerty, can you give
me something for it?

08:59.830 --> 09:03.625
Message received from your
wife, Sam, via Jupiter link.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.045
Fuck.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.471
Hi, Sam. It's me.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.559
I got your last message.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.770
It was really good
to hear your voice.

09:23.854 --> 09:25.438
I miss you, too.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.317
I know you're really
lonely up there,

09:29.652 --> 09:31.611
but I think,

09:31.696 --> 09:34.990
in a lot of ways, it's
been really good for you.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.284
For both of us.

09:38.327 --> 09:41.162
God, I hope you don't
mind me saying that.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.001
I'm proud of you.

09:47.461 --> 09:49.671
Someone's got something to say.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.884
What did you want to
say to Daddy, baby?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.762
Say, astronaut.

09:58.180 --> 10:00.223
Astronaut, Daddy.

10:01.142 --> 10:06.104
Who's an astronaut? Daddy's an astronaut.
Say it really loudly.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.231
Daddy's an astronaut.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.276
Clever girl. Wave.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.861
Give Daddy a wave.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.156
Kathy, could you...

10:18.743 --> 10:21.703
I can't believe you're
going to be home soon.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.914
It's her birthday next month.

10:24.999 --> 10:28.084
And I was thinking about maybe
a playhouse for the garden.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.670
- Gerty.
- We could pick it out together.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.547
Sam.

10:33.716 --> 10:37.636
I love you.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.803
And I miss you.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.263
I miss you.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.850
And I can't wait to see you.

10:43.934 --> 10:47.395
Okay, sweetheart. Bye.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.964
Hi, Doug.

11:16.258 --> 11:19.344
You're really full of
yourself, aren't you, Doug?

11:19.720 --> 11:21.221
Kathryn.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.324
Not good.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.618
What about Dumbo?

11:43.703 --> 11:46.413
Doesn't he object to your...

11:46.831 --> 11:49.040
Yes. Darrin objects.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.168
But it's a special occasion
because of the morning light.

12:27.496 --> 12:30.623
Ah, fuck! God damn it!

12:31.625 --> 12:32.751
Fuck!

12:35.629 --> 12:37.672
It's gotta smart,
doesn't it, Gerty?

12:38.466 --> 12:40.675
Sam, can I ask how it happened?

12:40.760 --> 12:45.180
I told you, I saw something on TV and
I spilled boiling water on my hand.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.599
You saw something on TV?

12:47.683 --> 12:50.101
Yeah, I saw something on
TV that distracted me.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.353
Is there something wrong
with that, Gerty?

12:52.438 --> 12:55.356
Sam, you said it was the
TV that distracted you.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.776
But when I came in,
the TV wasn't on.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.278
Perhaps you were
imagining things.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.533
Yeah, you think too much, pal.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.663
You need to get laid. I'm
going to go back to work.

13:50.412 --> 13:54.207
I am the one and only.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.503
Oh, yeah!

14:03.759 --> 14:05.760
Okay. Shut up.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.296
Morning, Gerty.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.590
Morning, Sam. How are you today?

14:43.674 --> 14:45.466
Fine. Fine.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.511
- How's the hand?
- Oh, it's a little sore.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.555
Little sore. It's okay.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.225
What's for breakfast?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.768
The usual.

15:01.483 --> 15:02.775
Two weeks to go, Sam.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.819
Two weeks to go, buddy.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.323
Would you like some hot
sauce on your beans?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.492
No, my tummy's a little
tender, actually.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.538
But thank you. Thank you, Gerty.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.373
You're welcome, Sam.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.584
8:19 Pacific Time.

15:19.668 --> 15:24.339
Readouts are as follows.
Matthew, 9.8 miles.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.634
Mark is nine...

15:27.718 --> 15:29.844
Hey, Gerty...

15:29.929 --> 15:31.471
Rock and roll.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.943
Mark...

15:45.527 --> 15:47.946
Mark's 11 miles on the button.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.326
Luke's a little twitchy today.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.299
Hey, Gerty,

16:08.384 --> 16:10.718
looks like we got a live
one out on Matthew.

16:11.261 --> 16:12.637
I'm gonna go out
in a few minutes.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.431
I'm just going to
finish my coffee, okay?

16:15.516 --> 16:16.849
Okay, Sam.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.691
Searching for long-range comms.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.238
Signal failure on
long-range comms.

17:39.183 --> 17:42.351
Danger. Atmospheric compromise.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.385
Where am...

18:16.970 --> 18:18.429
Where am I?

18:18.847 --> 18:22.642
Sam, you're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.936
Do you remember what happened?

18:30.359 --> 18:33.027
No, I don't... I don't
remember a thing.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.572
Do you remember me?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.827
Yeah, of course I
remember you, Gerty.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.204
That's good. That's very good.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.665
It's nice to see
you awake again.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.584
I'd like to keep you under
observation here in the Infirmary

18:48.669 --> 18:51.170
for a few days and
run some tests.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.258
How long have I been out?

18:55.717 --> 18:58.553
Not long, Sam. Go back to sleep.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.887
Okay, bro.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.266
You're still very tired.
We can talk later.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.598
Hello?

20:09.124 --> 20:12.418
Good working order, but we only
have two working Harvesters now.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.794
Come on, come on.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.963
Yeah, well, that's no surprise,
but it's not good enough.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.716
Gerty, we're gonna have to find
a way to ramp up production

20:18.800 --> 20:20.593
- on Mark and John.
- I know.

20:20.677 --> 20:24.680
This is incredible. How do you
manage to fucking break a Harvester

20:24.765 --> 20:26.891
and an employee, all
in the same day?

20:26.975 --> 20:30.144
These were extraordinary
circumstances, as you know.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.730
Gerty, what's the
status on Harvester 3?

20:32.814 --> 20:34.482
How are the repairs going ahead?

20:34.942 --> 20:37.902
- Sam. You're out of bed.
- Yeah.

20:38.570 --> 20:41.697
I wanted to stretch my legs.
Who was that?

20:44.534 --> 20:47.078
We've been having some
problems with the Lunar Sat,

20:47.162 --> 20:49.288
and our live feed
seems to be down.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.916
I was recording a video
message for Central,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.252
updating them on your progress.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.879
Sam, you need to stay in bed.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.173
You're not ready to
walk around yet.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.842
All right.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.179
Could you give me my sunglasses?
It's really bright in here.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.266
Give me my...

21:08.350 --> 21:10.601
Give me all my stuff, you know.

21:10.978 --> 21:13.020
Your belongings are in
your quarters, Sam.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.148
- Well, bring it in here.
- Certainly.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.453
Excellent, Sam.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.291
What...

21:34.167 --> 21:35.751
When can I get out
of here, Gerty?

21:35.836 --> 21:38.713
Sam, you may have suffered from
brain damage in the crash.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.758
This would explain your slight
memory loss and logic impairment.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.513
So, what's the diagnosis?
When can I get back to work?

21:47.597 --> 21:50.057
Central has asked me to
slow down the Harvesters

21:50.142 --> 21:53.311
to ensure you have time to recuperate
and get your strength back.

21:53.395 --> 21:56.480
That's terrific. It's fantastic.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.899
You can return to the
sleeping quarters tomorrow,

21:58.984 --> 22:00.526
but it will still
be a few more days

22:00.610 --> 22:04.363
before you can resume anything
like a normal work schedule.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.659
- Let's try another test.
- I don't want to try another test.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.119
Please, Sam.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.857
Hey, Gerty.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.820
You know about this?

22:45.614 --> 22:48.949
Matthew's got no velocity readout.
He's completely still.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.451
He must have stalled.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.619
Well, he's obviously stalled.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.621
Don't you think we
should tell Central?

22:53.705 --> 22:56.207
Unlock the doors and
I'll go fix it.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.334
I'll pass on your message.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.836
Message received from
Earth via Jupiter link.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.337
Sam, we appreciate the offer,

23:43.422 --> 23:45.589
but you concentrate
on feeling better.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.926
Hey, we don't want you to
take any unnecessary risks.

23:49.010 --> 23:51.887
- You're too important to us.
- You're to stay put.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.222
That is an order.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.099
It's an order, Sam. From Lunar.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.976
And what we're going to
do is send a rescue unit

23:57.060 --> 24:00.187
to tend to the stalled Harvester
and get the base back on its feet.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.189
What the fuck is...
What the fuck...

24:02.274 --> 24:03.983
- I'm sorry, Sam.
- What?

24:04.067 --> 24:07.611
Sam, I'm under strict orders
not to let you outside.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.406
I don't appreciate that.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.367
Being treated like a child.
I don't appreciate it.

24:51.531 --> 24:52.907
Gerty!

24:58.079 --> 25:00.706
Gerty! Gerty, come here!

25:01.791 --> 25:03.000
What happened?

25:03.084 --> 25:04.960
I don't know. Meteorites.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.712
There have been no
meteorites, Sam.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.589
Micro-meteorites
maybe, I don't know.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.966
Either way, there might be
damage to the exterior shell.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.844
I think you'd better... You'd better
let me go outside and take a look.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.055
There is no damage to
the exterior shell.

25:16.139 --> 25:18.349
Well, it's not that I
don't believe you, Gerty,

25:18.433 --> 25:20.184
but I mean, you know, this
thing is springing leaks

25:20.268 --> 25:21.727
like an Acme fire hose.

25:21.811 --> 25:24.146
You need to let me go outside
and fix this problem, Gerty.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.607
I can't let you go outside, Sam.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.318
Gerty, if you don't let me go
outside, we can't fix this leak.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.612
I'm not permitted to
let you go outside.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.157
Just let... We'll keep it
between you and me. Okay, pal?

25:35.450 --> 25:38.410
This thing is springing gas, let's go.
Come on.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.454
Just to check the
exterior shell.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.456
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, Sam.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.874
Thank you.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.306
Gerty.

26:33.174 --> 26:44.101
Searching for long-range comms.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.231
Signal failure on
long-range comms.

28:49.686 --> 28:51.979
Gerty! Gerty!

28:55.400 --> 29:00.821
I found him outside.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.491
By the stalled Harvester.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.660
Who is he? Who is he?

29:07.078 --> 29:08.871
We need to get him
to the Infirmary.

29:08.955 --> 29:12.332
You tell... You tell
me who that is.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.668
You tell me who that is!

29:14.753 --> 29:16.086
Sam Bell.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.256
We need to get him to the
Infirmary immediately.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.229
Hello, Sam. How are you feeling?

29:39.569 --> 29:42.529
Where... Where am I?

29:42.947 --> 29:44.239
The Infirmary.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.867
You had an accident out
by one of the Harvesters.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.869
- Do you remember?
- I'm...

29:50.705 --> 29:52.080
I'm thirsty.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.000
I could get you some water.

30:00.965 --> 30:04.051
I saw someone out there, Gerty.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.890
I saw someone out there.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.644
Sam, you suffered a slight
concussion in the crash

30:13.728 --> 30:15.813
and have incurred
minor injuries.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.524
But all in all, the
prognosis is good.

30:20.860 --> 30:22.903
I'm happy to see you again.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.137
- Gerty.
- Yes, Sam.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.643
Is there someone in
the room with us?

30:58.898 --> 31:00.732
Sam, get some sleep.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.777
You're very tired.

31:28.094 --> 31:33.265
Spoke to Thompson today. Now that you're
up there, he's promising the world.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.649
I think it was the right thing.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.485
But...

31:46.988 --> 31:49.114
It's just such a long time.

31:52.368 --> 31:54.661
But I suppose there
are things...

31:56.164 --> 31:59.541
You know, that needed to happen.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.545
I... I need time to think.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.180
Listen, Sam,

32:15.725 --> 32:21.021
be safe, and I'll talk to you soon.
Bye.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.178
Gerty...

32:54.097 --> 32:57.391
Gerty, what the... What...
What the hell's going on?

32:58.351 --> 33:00.769
Who's the guy... Who's
the guy in the Rec Room?

33:00.853 --> 33:03.397
Where did he come from?
Why does he look like me?

33:03.481 --> 33:05.607
Sam, you're out of bed.

33:05.692 --> 33:06.858
Yeah, Gerty, I'm out of bed.

33:06.943 --> 33:10.153
Who's the guy... Who's
the guy in the Rec Room?

33:10.238 --> 33:11.571
Sam Bell.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.740
Come on, come on, come on.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.742
You are Sam Bell.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.913
Sam, what is it?

33:20.373 --> 33:22.374
It might help to talk about it.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.293
Gerty, I don't understand
what's happening.

33:25.586 --> 33:28.005
I'm losing my mind.

33:28.089 --> 33:30.048
We could run some tests.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.592
I haven't let Sam contact Lunar.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.178
They don't know you were recovered
alive from the accident...

33:35.263 --> 33:37.514
Recovered alive? What do you mean...
What are you talk...

33:37.598 --> 33:40.142
Why didn't you report it to Central?
What are you talking about?

33:40.226 --> 33:42.436
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.604
Are you hungry?

34:21.309 --> 34:23.726
Two weeks, two
weeks, two weeks...

34:26.856 --> 34:30.984
Two weeks, two weeks, two weeks,
two weeks, two weeks, two weeks...

34:56.302 --> 34:57.761
Just getting my slippers.

34:57.845 --> 35:00.263
- I'm using them. I'm using them.
- No. What?

35:00.640 --> 35:02.474
These are mine. These are mine.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.862
Gerty says you're Sam Bell.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.032
I'm Sam Bell, too.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.159
What?

35:21.244 --> 35:22.994
We've got that going for us.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.289
Why...

35:32.088 --> 35:33.880
How long have you...

35:34.298 --> 35:35.674
What?

35:35.758 --> 35:37.551
How long have you been here?

35:37.844 --> 35:39.386
About a week.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.805
So, how you doing?

35:41.889 --> 35:43.807
- What?
- How are you doing?

35:46.060 --> 35:48.145
How am I... How am I doing?

35:50.606 --> 35:52.607
How do you think I'm doing?

35:58.030 --> 35:59.322
Good job.

36:03.077 --> 36:06.872
They locked all the exits. Who's
looking after the Harvesters?

36:08.916 --> 36:10.542
Harvesters are fine.

36:10.626 --> 36:12.252
It's affected them.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.963
Here, talking to a clone,
that's slightly troubling.

36:15.673 --> 36:21.094
I'm not a clone.

36:27.351 --> 36:29.060
You're the clone.

36:29.145 --> 36:32.731
Okay, Sam, you're not a clone.

36:40.615 --> 36:44.910
Hey. Hey, Ridley, you're
not looking too good.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.370
Butt out of this.

36:47.455 --> 36:50.123
Davey, I'm talking to Ridley.
How you doing, pal?

36:50.833 --> 36:54.586
Hey, I think Kathryn likes you.
I think she likes you, pal.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.380
You're not looking
too good, my friend.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.049
Sorry you're not
feeling too well.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.425
You talking to yourself?

37:00.509 --> 37:03.345
- I'll just get you all fixed up.
- How long have you been here?

37:04.680 --> 37:09.434
Oh, I guess about three years.
Almost three years.

37:11.354 --> 37:15.148
Listen, I... I
wanted to thank you.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.027
I wanted to thank you for...

37:20.154 --> 37:22.614
If it wasn't for you,

37:23.032 --> 37:25.408
I guess I'd still be
in that crashed rover.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.619
You saved my life and...

37:30.748 --> 37:33.500
Hey, I know this is
weird, you know.

37:35.336 --> 37:37.545
I'm real lonely, you know...

37:37.964 --> 37:41.258
I just want to shake your hand.
Will you shake my hand?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.891
Maybe later.

37:56.399 --> 37:57.732
What are you looking at?

37:57.817 --> 38:00.443
You look just like me.
It's incredible.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.863
Why do I look like you? Why
don't you look like me?

38:04.240 --> 38:08.493
We look like each other, I guess.
Hey, you know...

38:11.747 --> 38:14.124
It's weird for me,
too, you know.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.879
Fuck.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.840
Hey.

38:24.093 --> 38:26.594
Hey, you wanna play
some Ping-Pong?

38:28.556 --> 38:29.723
No.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.892
Come on, I'll teach you.
It'll help you relax.

38:36.897 --> 38:39.399
- What's the score?
- 2-18.

38:39.483 --> 38:40.608
Okay.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.028
Do you want me to show
you how to hold that?

38:43.112 --> 38:45.280
No. No, I...

38:45.364 --> 38:48.158
I don't need you to
show me how to hold it.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.163
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

38:54.707 --> 38:57.709
- Should we, uh... Should we play?
- Yeah.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.133
God! Shit!

39:05.885 --> 39:09.095
- 19-2.
- Yeah.

39:10.931 --> 39:13.266
Do you want a stick of gum?

39:16.354 --> 39:19.647
You know, we could approach
this in a different way.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.776
Remember when we went
to flight school...

39:22.860 --> 39:24.110
What are you doing?

39:24.195 --> 39:27.197
I'm fixing the net. It's
very Zen, Ping-Pong.

39:27.281 --> 39:28.615
You have to just relax.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.837
How long did it take
you to do that?

39:43.506 --> 39:45.632
Well, I don't remember
doing all of it.

39:45.716 --> 39:50.136
I remember doing the church,
and the Salvation Army,

39:50.221 --> 39:52.555
and a few of the people.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.850
My mind's been acting
kind of weird lately.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.731
That's Fairfield, right?

40:02.274 --> 40:04.150
There's the Town Hall.

40:05.152 --> 40:08.446
Fairfield? Of course, you
know about Fairfield.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.994
Yeah, there's Tess and Eve.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.084
Do you know Tess?

40:28.843 --> 40:30.427
Yeah. I know Tess.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.265
- You know about Eve, right?
- What?

40:35.349 --> 40:37.767
I had a... We had a girl.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.312
Eve.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.902
Isn't she beautiful?
She's my little monkey.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.447
She's our little monkey.

40:52.324 --> 40:53.491
High-five.

40:59.081 --> 41:02.375
She might be the milkman's,
but she's beautiful.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.464
Sam, a new message has
arrived from Earth.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.466
Oh, shit.

41:16.098 --> 41:17.682
- Greetings, Sam.
- How's our man?

41:17.766 --> 41:19.809
You feeling better?
You have enough rest?

41:19.894 --> 41:23.146
Okay, you resting up, Sam?
You better be, you bastard.

41:23.230 --> 41:26.149
Well, enjoy it while it lasts.
We've got some good news.

41:26.233 --> 41:28.234
The Jupiter Program had
to be put on hiatus,

41:28.319 --> 41:30.153
so we got a few pairs
of hands for you.

41:30.237 --> 41:33.698
So, what we've managed to do is secure
you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule.

41:33.782 --> 41:35.492
Rescue Unit Eliza.

41:35.576 --> 41:38.828
Now, Eliza has been stationed on
Goliath 19 for the last two months.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.915
Now we expect them to reach you
in approximately 14 hours.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.500
So commence to jump for Joy.

41:43.584 --> 41:45.376
You're about to be back in work.

41:45.461 --> 41:48.755
In the meantime, hang in there.
Rest up.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.757
You hang in there, Sam.
Over and out.

41:51.926 --> 41:53.176
They're sending a Rescue Unit?

41:53.260 --> 41:55.386
Why? Why are they
sending a Rescue Unit?

41:55.471 --> 41:58.765
To fix the stalled Harvester.
They didn't think I was up to it.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.893
Well, then I'm going back.
That's it for me.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.270
What?

42:04.396 --> 42:06.022
Is that what you really think?

42:06.106 --> 42:09.943
Yeah. I've got a contract.
I'm going home.

42:10.778 --> 42:12.862
You're a fucking clone.
You don't have shit.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.740
- Hey, I'm going home.
- You're not going anywhere.

42:15.824 --> 42:17.492
You know, you've been
up here too long, man.

42:17.576 --> 42:18.618
You've lost your marbles.

42:18.702 --> 42:22.121
What, do you think Tess is back home,
waiting for you on the sofa in lingerie?

42:22.206 --> 42:25.208
What about the original Sam?
Huh?

42:25.292 --> 42:27.460
I'm the original Sam!

42:27.545 --> 42:29.045
I'm Sam fucking Bell!

42:29.129 --> 42:32.257
- Hey, hey. Whoa.
- Me! Me!

42:33.676 --> 42:36.553
Gerty, am I a clone?

42:38.973 --> 42:40.515
Are you hungry?

42:45.896 --> 42:47.188
Hey, hey.

42:48.691 --> 42:51.526
Don't get your fucking
panties in a twist.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.111
I'm in the same boat, asshole.

42:58.784 --> 43:01.703
- Listen. What about the other clones?
- What?

43:01.787 --> 43:03.746
We might not be the first
two to be woken up.

43:03.831 --> 43:06.457
You said that model had already
been started when you got here.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.126
Well, who started it?

43:08.210 --> 43:10.670
There might be others
up here right now.

43:11.505 --> 43:15.425
Think about it. How did I get up
here so quickly after your crash?

43:15.509 --> 43:18.344
- I don't want to talk about it.
- They didn't ship me in from Central.

43:18.429 --> 43:21.639
There wasn't time. I must
have come from the base.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.142
I don't know what
you're smoking.

43:24.226 --> 43:26.477
Why would they do that?
That's ridiculous.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.104
Impossible.

43:28.188 --> 43:30.023
I bet there's some
kind of secret room.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.232
Secret room?

43:32.401 --> 43:33.735
Yeah, a secret room. Why not?

43:33.819 --> 43:36.279
You're the one who's
lost your marbles.

43:36.363 --> 43:38.531
I've been here for
three years, man.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.074
I know every inch of this base.

43:40.159 --> 43:43.620
I know how many... How much dirt's
between those wall panels over there.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.538
Why would they do that?
What's the motive?

43:45.623 --> 43:48.291
Look, it's a company, right?

43:48.375 --> 43:50.543
They have investors.
They have shareholders.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.295
Shit like that. What's cheaper?

43:52.379 --> 43:54.339
Spending time and money
training new personnel,

43:54.423 --> 43:57.383
or you just have a couple of
spares here to do the job.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.302
It's the far side of the moon.

43:59.386 --> 44:03.389
The cheap fucks haven't even fixed
the communications satellite yet.

44:05.225 --> 44:06.934
Tess would know. She
would have told me.

44:07.019 --> 44:08.728
Hey, Geppetto, wake up.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.980
You really think they
give a shit about us?

44:11.065 --> 44:12.857
They're laughing all
the way to the bank.

44:12.941 --> 44:14.275
Tess would know. She
would have told me...

44:14.360 --> 44:15.902
What do you get off

44:15.986 --> 44:18.738
fucking sitting there, sulking
like a little fucking boy!

44:18.822 --> 44:20.948
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Wake up!

44:22.701 --> 44:26.704
I bet there's some area
that we don't know about.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.123
And I'm gonna find it.

44:29.958 --> 44:33.044
Yeah, maybe you'll find
some buried treasure, too.

45:07.287 --> 45:08.454
Fuck!

45:09.331 --> 45:12.250
Eliza arrival
estimated 13 hours.

45:13.252 --> 45:15.586
You found your secret room?

45:17.297 --> 45:19.215
Just put that anywhere.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.677
Now, that's a good idea.
That's...

45:22.761 --> 45:23.928
That's where I keep
my leprechauns.

45:24.012 --> 45:27.181
- Get out of the way.
- What? Why?

45:27.266 --> 45:29.308
I want to look
underneath that model.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.019
You're not touching this model.

45:32.187 --> 45:34.063
Get the fuck out of the way.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.399
Listen, why don't
you relax, okay?

45:36.483 --> 45:38.359
Why don't you take a pill?
Bake a cake?

45:38.444 --> 45:40.820
- Go read the encyclopedia or something?
- You're a tough guy now?

45:40.904 --> 45:42.447
What, are you going to stab me?

45:42.531 --> 45:44.240
No, I'm a peaceful warrior.

45:44.324 --> 45:46.409
I'm a lover. I'm not a fighter.

45:46.493 --> 45:47.702
Put the knife down.

45:47.786 --> 45:48.995
- Hey, hey, just...
- I want to look underneath there.

45:49.079 --> 45:50.830
- Put the knife down.
- No. I'm not going to give you the knife.

45:50.914 --> 45:52.749
- Just get out of the way.
- Take it easy 'cause I...

45:52.833 --> 45:56.544
- Let go of the knife.
- Don't ever tell me what to do, okay?

45:56.712 --> 45:59.297
Just... You let go.
Let go of the knife.

45:59.381 --> 46:01.340
- Don't be an asshole.
- Don't push me.

46:01.425 --> 46:04.177
- Don't push me, motherfucker.
- Let go.

46:04.636 --> 46:05.887
Let go.

46:16.523 --> 46:19.650
Fucking told you to let
go of the goddamn knife.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.239
Little fucking...

46:26.366 --> 46:28.534
Fucking little girl, man!

46:30.496 --> 46:33.790
- God damn it!
- No! No!

46:36.376 --> 46:39.545
God damn it. What
did I tell you?

46:49.097 --> 46:50.723
Okay, okay...

46:51.850 --> 46:53.976
You gonna stop? You gonna stop?

46:54.061 --> 46:56.395
Okay, okay.

46:58.398 --> 47:00.191
Jesus! Fuck...

47:01.568 --> 47:03.903
Fuck me. What the fuck?

47:04.321 --> 47:06.030
I hardly... I
hardly touched you.

47:06.114 --> 47:08.282
- My fucking eye, man.
- Let me see.

47:08.367 --> 47:11.077
- That's a lot of blood.
- Get off of me!

47:15.541 --> 47:17.041
That's enough.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.305
Well, appealing...

47:32.558 --> 47:35.476
Nice feet, sexy...

48:06.800 --> 48:08.175
Hello, Sam.

48:10.137 --> 48:12.930
- Sam, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

48:14.558 --> 48:19.186
Yeah, we had a fight, me and
the other guy, the other...

48:21.023 --> 48:24.025
He's very angry, you know.

48:24.234 --> 48:25.860
Know what he did?

48:26.069 --> 48:28.529
He flipped my entire model over.

48:28.614 --> 48:30.281
Know how much work I
put into that thing?

48:30.365 --> 48:32.158
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours.

48:32.242 --> 48:35.494
Nine hundred and thirty-eight
hours, yeah, exactly.

48:36.121 --> 48:38.247
Nine hundred and
thirty-eight hours, really?

48:38.332 --> 48:39.832
Approximately.

48:41.460 --> 48:43.169
He's got a problem.

48:44.963 --> 48:46.756
He scares me, Gerty.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.133
What is it about Sam
that scares you?

48:49.217 --> 48:51.177
How he flies off the handle.

48:51.261 --> 48:54.347
I see it now. I see what
Tess was talking about.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.686
I never told you this,
Gerty, but she...

49:04.650 --> 49:06.359
She left me.

49:07.361 --> 49:09.445
Tess left me, for six months.

49:09.529 --> 49:11.447
She moved back in
with her parents.

49:11.531 --> 49:12.782
I know.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.914
She gave me a second chance.

49:20.874 --> 49:22.750
I promised her I'd change.

49:22.834 --> 49:24.710
You have changed, Sam.

49:25.545 --> 49:28.881
Hey, Gerty, since I've been
up here, I've sent Tess...

49:29.424 --> 49:31.801
I've sent her over
100 video messages.

49:31.885 --> 49:35.972
Where did those messages go?
Did they ever reach her?

49:36.056 --> 49:39.392
Sam, I can only account for
what occurs on the base.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.855
What about the messages
she sent to me?

49:45.899 --> 49:49.235
Sam, I can only account for
what occurs on the base.

50:05.919 --> 50:09.422
Gerty...

50:14.720 --> 50:16.470
Am I really a clone?

50:18.890 --> 50:22.184
When you first arrived at Sarang,
there was a small crash.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.103
You woke up in the Infirmary.

50:24.187 --> 50:27.023
You suffered minor brain
damage and memory loss.

50:27.107 --> 50:30.026
I kept you under observation
and ran some tests.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.736
I remember, yeah.
I remember that.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.988
Sam, there was no crash.

50:34.072 --> 50:35.489
You were being awakened.

50:35.574 --> 50:37.825
It is standard procedure
for all new clones

50:37.909 --> 50:40.661
to be given tests to
establish mental stability

50:40.746 --> 50:42.288
and general physical health.

50:42.372 --> 50:46.375
Genetic abnormalities and minor
duplication errors in the DNA

50:46.460 --> 50:47.877
can have considerable
impact on...

50:47.961 --> 50:50.379
What about... What about Tess?
What about Eve?

50:50.464 --> 50:52.673
They are memory implants, Sam.

50:52.758 --> 50:56.886
Uploaded, edited memories
of the original Sam Bell.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.949
I am very sorry.

51:22.496 --> 51:25.289
Sam, it's been several hours
since your last meal.

51:25.373 --> 51:27.500
Can I prepare you something?

52:11.419 --> 52:14.880
Rescue arrival
estimated 11 hours.

52:17.801 --> 52:19.176
Okay, sweetheart?

52:19.261 --> 52:22.263
Yeah, I'm staring into space.
Get it?

52:23.348 --> 52:24.765
- Funny.
- Hey...

52:25.433 --> 52:27.685
Thanks for this. This is good.

52:27.894 --> 52:29.353
This is cozy.

52:29.437 --> 52:31.647
How's the... How's the nose?

52:31.898 --> 52:33.732
Much better, thank you.

52:35.235 --> 52:39.405
I went haywire before, you know, I...
I lost it and I'm...

52:42.200 --> 52:44.994
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay.

52:45.078 --> 52:48.581
No, it's not okay. I fucked up Fairfield.
I fucked up your model.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.833
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I got a...

52:50.917 --> 52:53.085
I got a temper. I gotta
do something about it.

52:53.170 --> 52:54.587
Yes, you do.

52:58.175 --> 53:01.635
Hey, can you turn that off for a second?
I want to talk to you.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.597
Can you turn that off? Listen...

53:05.307 --> 53:08.058
Listen, I wasn't supposed to...
I'm...

53:10.520 --> 53:13.731
I'm trying to tell you something.
Can you turn...

53:15.692 --> 53:17.860
Lunar instructed Gerty to...

53:20.906 --> 53:23.782
Listen to me. I wasn't
supposed to find you...

53:29.206 --> 53:31.457
- Tough guy.
- Listen to me...

53:31.541 --> 53:32.750
- You look like a...
- What?

53:32.834 --> 53:35.211
- ...radioactive tampon.
- I wasn't supposed to...

53:35.295 --> 53:37.963
Or like a banana with
a yeast infection.

53:39.132 --> 53:42.009
Listen to me. I wasn't
supposed to find you.

53:42.928 --> 53:46.931
Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside
the base while you were out there.

53:47.015 --> 53:50.392
And there's something else. Right
around the time I was awakened,

53:50.477 --> 53:52.186
I walked in on Gerty
talking to Central.

53:52.270 --> 53:54.772
He was having a
live conversation.

53:54.856 --> 53:57.733
- A live conversation?
- Yeah.

53:57.817 --> 54:00.653
How do you know it was
a live conversation?

54:00.987 --> 54:03.739
Because it was a back
and forth exchange.

54:04.908 --> 54:07.743
Communications equipment was damaged.
There was a solar storm.

54:07.827 --> 54:09.745
It was live, man. It was live.

54:09.829 --> 54:12.456
That's impossible. There was a flare.
It fried the satellite.

54:12.540 --> 54:15.668
The satellite's fine. They don't
want us to be able to contact Earth.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.419
They lied to us.

54:17.504 --> 54:18.837
They've been lying to
us since the beginning.

54:18.922 --> 54:22.007
They... They've been lying
to us since forever.

54:22.759 --> 54:24.343
If the satellite works,
how are they blocking

54:24.427 --> 54:27.680
the live feed from down here?
Everything works fine.

54:27.764 --> 54:31.475
Maybe they're not blocking the
signal from inside the base.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.560
From where then?

54:55.041 --> 55:00.796
Searching for long-range comms.

55:00.880 --> 55:03.549
I'm just passing the last of the
Harvesters. Looks like John.

55:03.633 --> 55:05.843
Searching for long-range comms.

55:06.428 --> 55:08.846
How long until you're out
of the base's range?

55:08.930 --> 55:13.058
About a minute.
Ninety seconds, tops.

55:13.435 --> 55:16.145
- You ever been out this far?
- No.

55:16.229 --> 55:19.440
- Signal failure on long-range comms.
- Never have.

55:20.817 --> 55:29.366
Leaving Sarang
working perimeter.

55:42.255 --> 55:43.380
You see anything?

55:43.465 --> 55:46.967
It would help if I knew what
the hell I was looking for.

55:48.553 --> 55:50.763
Wait a second, I see something.

55:51.723 --> 55:54.224
Approaching Station 3.

56:36.476 --> 56:37.643
Holy shit.

56:38.144 --> 56:40.354
I think I see something, too.

56:40.563 --> 56:43.357
Approaching Station 1.

56:48.488 --> 56:49.822
You see what I see?

56:49.906 --> 56:53.075
Looks like an antenna or
a pylon or something.

56:53.159 --> 56:56.787
I think it's the jammer.
I knew it.

56:56.871 --> 56:59.832
This is why we're not
getting the live feed.

57:19.018 --> 57:21.478
Sam? Can you hear me?

57:21.563 --> 57:25.399
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you.

57:26.401 --> 57:27.526
Yeah.

57:28.403 --> 57:32.114
Listen, I'm not feeling too good.
I'm gonna head back to the base.

57:32.198 --> 57:33.866
Okay, I'm gonna stay out
here for a little while.

57:33.950 --> 57:37.119
I'm gonna see if there's
any more of these things.

57:56.598 --> 57:59.099
Fuck, fuck.

58:01.728 --> 58:05.522
Fuck, fuck. Fuck.

59:42.161 --> 59:57.217

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:23.660
Password accepted.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.586
Accessing Sam Bell database.

01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:35.797
I'm done.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:38.550
Fifteen point...

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.928
My hair's falling out.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.182
I'd better start for home...

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:47.768
For the last time, over and out.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.481
The pod is designed to put
you into a deep sleep

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:56.443
for the duration of your three-day
return journey back to Earth.

01:00:57.236 --> 01:00:58.570
Safe trip.

01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:11.708
Fuck.

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.088
Here she is.

01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:19.383
I'm gonna go and see her soon.

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:37.526
Lunar Industries remains
the number one provider

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:42.406
of clean energy worldwide due to
the hard work of people like you.

01:01:59.173 --> 01:02:02.551
Rescue arrival
estimated nine hours.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:24.281
Lay down, relax, and
breathe deeply.

01:02:24.949 --> 01:02:28.994
The cryogenic protection pod is
designed to put you into a deep sleep

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:32.789
for the duration of your three-day
return journey back to Earth.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.750
As you begin to feel sleepy,

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:37.919
think about the magnificent
job that you've done

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:41.631
and how proud your family are
of what you've accomplished.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:44.509
Lunar Industries remains
the number one provider

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:49.431
of clean energy worldwide due to
the hard work of people like you.

01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:53.268
Safe trip, Annyeonghi
gaseyo, and goodbye.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.214
Approaching Station 2.

01:04:43.796 --> 01:04:46.423
Hey, I saw three more
of those jammers.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:52.053
I think the base is surrounded.
I printed out the coordinates.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.556
What's wrong with you?

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.600
What's going on?

01:04:57.602 --> 01:04:59.603
I found your secret room.

01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:21.499
Who goes first?

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:23.335
I go first.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.268
Jesus Christ, there's
so many of them.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:25.313
Why are there so many of them?

01:07:09.775 --> 01:07:12.485
Sam, can I help you
with something?

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:14.529
Not now, Gerty. I'm okay.

01:07:18.784 --> 01:07:20.201
Gerty...

01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:24.622
Why did you help me before?
With the password?

01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:28.001
Doesn't that go against your
programing or something?

01:07:28.085 --> 01:07:30.086
Helping you is what I do.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:44.017
Leaving Sarang
working perimeter.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:52.525
Searching for long-range comms.

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:04.996
Signal re-established.

01:08:24.558 --> 01:08:25.975
Hello?

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.604
Is this the Bell residence?

01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:31.606
This is the Bell residence.

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:34.317
Could you call back? There's
something wrong with the picture.

01:08:34.401 --> 01:08:36.611
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:40.365
I'm sorry. She passed
away some years ago.

01:08:58.759 --> 01:09:00.218
Are you sure?

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.095
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.

01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:05.265
Can I help you?

01:09:08.602 --> 01:09:09.727
Eve?

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:13.022
- Yeah?
- Hi. Hi, Eve.

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.568
How old... How old are you now?

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.069
I'm 15.

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:21.573
- Do I know you?
- Oh, sweetheart.

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:25.535
How did Mommy die, sweetheart?

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.080
How did Mommy die?

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:30.915
Dad?

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:32.542
Yeah?

01:09:32.626 --> 01:09:34.419
There's someone
asking about Mom.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:37.087
Who's asking about Mom?

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.225
That's enough. That's enough.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.609
I want to go home.

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:40.735
Eliza arrival estimated
in seven hours.

01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:44.989
Ow, fuck. Shit.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.492
- What, did you cut yourself?
- Yeah.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.371
What are you laughing at?

01:10:51.455 --> 01:10:54.582
Well, you don't hold it like
you're trying to stab somebody.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.834
For God sakes. Here,
give me that.

01:11:02.633 --> 01:11:04.926
You gotta hold it closer
to the blade, you see?

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:08.054
- Watch what I'm doing.
- Why are you shaking?

01:11:08.138 --> 01:11:10.139
You carve out, like that.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.572
That's it.

01:11:26.657 --> 01:11:27.949
It's freezing in here.

01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.368
Well, you're... You're
sitting under the fridge.

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:33.454
What's going on with you?
Are you all right?

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:37.375
Yeah, that crew they're
sending in, if they...

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:40.295
If they find us awake at
the same time, you know...

01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:42.588
They're not gonna let us live.

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:47.010
You know that, right?

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.848
You know, their
return vehicle is...

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:56.394
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:58.896
Are you okay?

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:05.403
Maybe you should lay down for a while,
take some tranquilizers or something.

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:08.656
If I take some tranquilizers,
I'll never wake up again.

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:20.209
You'll be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.805
I'm freezing.

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.069
Hey, hey...

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.446
Hey.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.288
I'm really scared.

01:13:03.587 --> 01:13:05.338
Where are you going?

01:13:59.351 --> 01:14:00.685
Hello?

01:14:02.187 --> 01:14:03.563
Is this the Bell residence?

01:14:03.647 --> 01:14:05.565
This is the Bell residence.

01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:09.110
Could you call back? There's
something wrong with the picture.

01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:11.279
I'm trying to reach Tess Bell.

01:14:11.363 --> 01:14:14.115
I'm sorry, she passed
away some years ago.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.243
Are you sure?

01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:20.037
Yeah, I think so.
I'm her daughter.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.706
Can I help you?

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:20.973
Gerty, I need to talk to you.

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:22.725
Of course, Sam. How can I help?

01:15:22.809 --> 01:15:25.937
We've found the hidden room.
We know about the others.

01:15:26.104 --> 01:15:28.147
That hidden room, Gerty.

01:15:28.815 --> 01:15:32.276
The lower deck is out of bounds
to awakened clones, Sam.

01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:35.571
Gerty, we need to
wake up a new clone.

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:39.867
New clones can only be awakened once
a three-year contract is completed.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.452
Gerty, if we don't
wake up a new clone,

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.038
me and the other Sam will
die, we will be killed.

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:46.624
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.834
Do you want me and the
other Sam to be killed?

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:50.294
That is the last thing I want.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.547
Well, then you have to
wake up a new clone.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:53.965
Okay, pal?

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:10.773
Eliza arrival estimated
in five hours.

01:16:11.316 --> 01:16:14.986
I am the one and only.

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:38.342
God.

01:17:01.658 --> 01:17:06.495
Hey.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.127
What's going on? You okay?

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.964
Don't... Don't touch him.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.343
Come here.

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:24.639
He's not conscious yet.

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:26.474
Gerty and I just woke him up.

01:17:26.558 --> 01:17:28.392
Why? What's going on?

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.770
Come on. Come on outside.

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.776
When the rescue unit arrives,

01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.404
they're gonna expect to find a
body in that crashed rover.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:42.365
That guy?

01:17:44.284 --> 01:17:46.410
What, are you going to kill him?

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.954
- Jesus Christ.
- What are you doing?

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:50.623
Zip up your fly.

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:55.336
You're burning up. You
sweat like a pig.

01:17:57.589 --> 01:17:59.256
Put your hat on.

01:18:00.133 --> 01:18:02.093
- Put your hat on.
- I'm hot.

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:12.603
Hey, if we go through with this,

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.106
I'm gonna need your help hauling
him out to the crash site.

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.191
What about us?

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:20.486
Eliza arrives, finds you and
me as a welcome party...

01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.488
They're not going to find you
and me as a welcome party.

01:18:22.572 --> 01:18:24.365
They're gonna find me, and
you're going back to Earth

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:26.242
before they get here.

01:18:26.326 --> 01:18:27.743
In that helium-3 launcher.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:30.037
I did the math. You're
gonna pull some Gs,

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:32.957
but it should... It should be fine.
You'll be all right.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.709
You're going home.

01:18:35.627 --> 01:18:37.628
You did your three years.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:41.048
I can't expect you
to stick around.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.968
Maybe you can meet
Eve in person.

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:47.680
I saw that VP. She's beautiful.

01:18:48.306 --> 01:18:51.142
She's gorgeous. We did good.

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:53.644
High-five.

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:04.572
Go for it.

01:19:06.324 --> 01:19:08.200
You go for it.

01:19:15.041 --> 01:19:17.251
- You comfy?
- No.

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.336
- What?
- No!

01:19:25.677 --> 01:19:27.178
What if I have to take a shit?

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:30.347
Just... You'll have
to hold it in, pal.

01:19:31.224 --> 01:19:32.767
For three days?

01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:37.021
That's the way it goes.
Need a hand?

01:19:38.523 --> 01:19:39.565
No.

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.485
Fuck off.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:46.197
All right. No reason for hostility.
I'm just trying to help out.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:29.031
Eliza arrival estimated
three hours.

01:20:57.602 --> 01:20:59.228
Hey. We need to do this.

01:20:59.312 --> 01:21:03.357
We wait too long and
he's gonna be conscious.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:05.776
Fuck me.

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:08.654
What's going on with you?

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:12.157
I changed my mind.
I'm not going back.

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:17.162
I don't think I
can move my legs.

01:21:17.497 --> 01:21:19.206
Besides, look at me...

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:23.752
I meet Eve now, I'd scare
the crap out of her.

01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:27.506
What are you talking about, man?

01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:31.135
She's your daughter. She doesn't
care what you look like.

01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:34.680
You're not going
to kill anybody.

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:36.557
We can't kill anybody.

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:39.560
You can't. I know you
can't, 'cause I can't.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.812
You go.

01:21:45.525 --> 01:21:47.443
You're a good guy, Sam.

01:21:47.944 --> 01:21:51.947
It was a good plan, you know. You
just picked the wrong guy to go back.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.376
You... You sure about this?

01:22:07.839 --> 01:22:11.675
Yeah. You should
travel, you know.

01:22:12.552 --> 01:22:14.595
I always wanted to do that.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.848
Amsterdam, or...

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:22.895
Yeah, you know, I was thinking
about Hawaii or maybe Mexico.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:24.813
Aloha.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:29.109
Bring me back a pina
colada, all right, bro?

01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:15.906
Hey...

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:18.242
Johnny Spaceman.

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:23.747
You remember Tess came
in for that interview?

01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:26.417
She was so beautiful.

01:23:27.210 --> 01:23:30.421
She wasn't the best candidate,
but it didn't matter.

01:23:31.464 --> 01:23:33.549
I had to give her the job.

01:23:34.592 --> 01:23:37.094
I wanted to keep her
in the country.

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.598
- She was going back to Ireland.
- She was going back to Ireland.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:46.103
You knew you had
to take a chance,

01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:48.939
so you called her.

01:23:49.607 --> 01:23:52.443
You were terrified. You wrote that whole
speech for her answering machine.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:54.695
But you didn't need it, 'cause
she picked up the phone.

01:23:54.779 --> 01:23:57.406
She was, like, "Why
is he calling me?"

01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:00.868
"The internship's over. Why's
he calling me at home?"

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:07.666
I asked her if she wanted to go get like an
ice cream cone or something dorky like that.

01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:10.711
She said, "Let's get a drink."

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.090
I said, "Okay. What do you..."

01:27:04.802 --> 01:27:06.929
Sam, this is not going to work.

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:08.388
What? Why?

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:12.559
I've recorded everything that has
taken place since your awakening.

01:27:13.144 --> 01:27:15.187
If anyone were to check
my memory cache,

01:27:15.271 --> 01:27:17.981
it would put you in
considerable danger.

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:23.237
You could erase my memory banks.

01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:26.240
I could reboot myself
once you have departed.

01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:28.158
Are you okay with that?

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:31.495
I'm here to keep you safe, Sam.
I want to help you.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:46.343
Eliza arrival
estimated 24 minutes.

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:50.305
Sam.

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:57.354
Hey.

01:27:59.482 --> 01:28:02.651
I set your... I set
your computer to reboot

01:28:03.278 --> 01:28:05.279
the moment that I've launched.

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:07.114
I understand, Sam.

01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:08.365
Then you should be okay.

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:11.994
I hope life on Earth is
everything you remember it to be.

01:28:13.913 --> 01:28:15.414
Thanks, Gerty.

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:18.417
You gonna be okay?

01:28:18.501 --> 01:28:19.584
Of course.

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:21.962
The new Sam and I will be
back to our programing

01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:24.464
as soon as I've
finished rebooting.

01:28:25.508 --> 01:28:28.218
Gerty, we're not programed.

01:28:28.886 --> 01:28:30.971
We're people. Understand?

01:29:04.088 --> 01:29:07.591
Eliza arrival estimated
eight minutes.

01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:57.307
Fuck!

01:30:24.001 --> 01:30:26.461
Air lock pressurization
complete.

01:30:30.341 --> 01:30:31.633
Sam?

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.177
Hey, Sam?

01:30:36.514 --> 01:30:40.016
You okay, buddy? Cavalry's here.

01:30:43.312 --> 01:30:44.688
Where am I?

01:30:45.523 --> 01:30:48.942
You're in the Infirmary.
You had an accident.

01:30:49.026 --> 01:30:50.527
How long have I been out?

01:30:50.611 --> 01:30:53.530
Not long, Sam. Do you
remember what happened?

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:21.516
Made contact. Yeah.

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:32.402
Yeah, Eliza?

01:31:32.904 --> 01:31:34.863
He ain't going nowhere.

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:38.283
Bag him up and we'll get started
on repairs to the Harvester.

01:31:38.367 --> 01:31:39.743
Dwight, I'm gonna need the...

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:39.803
Lunar Industries stocks
have slipped a further 32%

01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:41.179
after accusations...

01:32:45.142 --> 01:32:47.394
Clone 6, the clone of Sam Bell,

01:32:47.478 --> 01:32:50.438
has been giving evidence at CAA's Board
of Directors meeting in Seattle...

01:32:50.523 --> 01:32:52.148
You know what? He's
one of two things.

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:54.150
He's a wacko or an
illegal immigrant.

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:56.611
Either way, they need to lock him up.
Line two.
