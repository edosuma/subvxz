01:20.575 --> 01:22.964
There's a bee on Maggie.

01:22.965 --> 01:28.187
Okay, Maggie, just calmly and
carefully back away.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.226
Beehive!

01:31.419 --> 01:32.809
Blueberries!

01:40.154 --> 01:43.229
I told you not to mock
me at picnics.

01:45.190 --> 01:47.419
Uh, attention, everyone.

01:47.425 --> 01:49.870
Uh, Luann and I
have some big news.

01:49.871 --> 01:51.212
Is it that you're
brother and sister?

01:51.211 --> 01:53.414
Because you really
look a lot alike.

01:53.412 --> 01:54.033
No.

01:54.039 --> 01:55.392
Half-brother
and half-sister?

01:55.395 --> 01:55.942
No!

01:55.956 --> 01:57.822
Siamese twins who've been
surgically separated?

01:57.828 --> 01:58.541
No.

01:58.546 --> 01:59.883
We're getting remarried.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.890
- Oh, that's great.
- Great. Ooh, cool.

02:01.908 --> 02:04.260
Way to go.
Many happy returns.

02:04.268 --> 02:06.421
This is so awesome.

02:06.426 --> 02:08.301
Finally you guys will stop using

02:08.306 --> 02:10.223
me as a pawn in your fights.

02:10.228 --> 02:12.472
Milhouse, you're
not a pawn.

02:12.478 --> 02:13.611
I know, I know.

02:13.618 --> 02:15.121
Did your father
say you were?

02:15.125 --> 02:16.283
No. I swear.

02:16.287 --> 02:18.691
I made it up.
Like kids do.

02:18.698 --> 02:20.751
Well, now that we're
a family again,

02:20.765 --> 02:22.783
you can stop your lying.

02:25.266 --> 02:26.382
Homer.

02:26.386 --> 02:28.160
The wedding's in 20 minutes.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.670
Just pick a tie.

02:30.577 --> 02:32.563
There are so many choices.

02:32.566 --> 02:34.783
Bolo? Clip-on? Piano keys?

02:34.786 --> 02:36.461
Ten Commandments of Beer?

02:36.505 --> 02:39.242
The cornerstones
of the Brewish faith.

02:39.287 --> 02:41.063
Why don't you wear a tie

02:41.068 --> 02:42.922
that goes with my eyes?

02:42.925 --> 02:45.460
And what color would that be?

02:45.478 --> 02:48.080
You don't know what
color my eyes are?!

02:48.085 --> 02:49.932
Of course I know.

02:49.938 --> 02:51.220
No peeking.

02:51.785 --> 02:53.400
I'm waiting.

02:53.485 --> 02:54.430
Uh....

02:54.497 --> 02:56.911
You really don't
know, do you?

02:56.916 --> 02:58.871
Is "beautiful" a color?

02:58.876 --> 02:59.701
No.

02:59.708 --> 03:01.072
Marge, give me a break.

03:01.075 --> 03:03.120
I don't notice the color
of people's eyes.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.203
I just judge them on
the color of their skin.

03:05.208 --> 03:05.711
Fine.

03:05.715 --> 03:07.291
Since the color-- ah!--

03:07.296 --> 03:08.800
of my eyes isn't-- ooh!--

03:08.808 --> 03:10.353
important to you-- aah!--

03:10.355 --> 03:11.970
then you don't get to-- Mmm!--

03:11.978 --> 03:12.970
see them until you--

03:12.978 --> 03:14.953
ow!-- remember.

03:15.008 --> 03:16.180
Oh!

03:16.617 --> 03:18.731
<i>Please do not kick sea turtles</i>

03:27.127 --> 03:28.483
She's wearing white?

03:28.487 --> 03:31.680
She must have rolled
the odometer back to zero.

03:33.867 --> 03:36.600
So you're good at
noticing dress colors,

03:36.608 --> 03:39.560
but not the eyes
that make your dinner.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.711
We are gathered here in the sight of

03:43.718 --> 03:46.473
God and this unsafe-for-swimming beach

03:46.477 --> 03:51.483
to celebrate the holy un-divorcing
of Kirk and Luann.

03:51.486 --> 03:53.143
Ow! What the...?

03:53.275 --> 03:54.682
Little help?

03:57.435 --> 03:58.443
Spaz.

03:59.766 --> 04:04.492
Do you, Kirk,
take Luann to re-have and re-hold?

04:04.495 --> 04:05.272
I do.

04:05.275 --> 04:08.090
And do you, Luann, take Kirk--

04:08.095 --> 04:10.923
despite the fact that he is
fundamentally the same man

04:10.926 --> 04:14.130
that you said in court was unfit
to load your dishwasher?

04:14.828 --> 04:16.963
Whose very touch repulsed you?

04:16.966 --> 04:19.081
- Uh, your...
- Whose many annoying...

04:19.088 --> 04:21.493
Uh, you're readingan
early draft of our vows.

04:21.498 --> 04:22.442
Just say "I do."

04:22.447 --> 04:23.110
I do.

04:23.118 --> 04:25.012
You may now kiss the bride.

04:25.017 --> 04:25.891
But make it quick.

04:25.895 --> 04:28.413
The seagulls have gotten
into the hors d'oeuvres.

04:29.385 --> 04:31.203
My friends, do not eat.

04:31.206 --> 04:32.862
Is made with seagull meat.

04:33.537 --> 04:35.381
See you in a week, Milhouse.

04:35.388 --> 04:37.321
Have fun at the Simpsons'.

04:37.328 --> 04:39.301
If you don't like
Mrs. Simpsons' cooking,

04:39.307 --> 04:40.903
you have your "mommy meals."

04:40.905 --> 04:42.221
I got 'em. Mm, mm.

04:42.325 --> 04:45.813
Why does every kid who stays
with us bring "mommy meals"?

04:45.815 --> 04:48.293
So I put pineapple
in my potato salad.

04:48.296 --> 04:49.991
Live a little, huh?

04:51.805 --> 04:54.383
That's why, to this day,

04:54.397 --> 04:58.630
you never see a shark
with monkey arms.

04:58.637 --> 05:01.523
Great story, Mr. Simpson.

05:01.528 --> 05:02.931
But why do all your bedroom stories
have

05:02.945 --> 05:04.691
commercials in them
for The Container Store?

05:04.698 --> 05:06.663
Because if I do it enough,

05:06.666 --> 05:09.053
maybe they'll start to pay me.

05:09.705 --> 05:11.131
Sleep tight.

05:11.135 --> 05:13.873
The Container Store, no wat
five convenient locations.

05:13.875 --> 05:17.010
Ah... now that my mom and
dad are back together,

05:17.015 --> 05:18.763
I'm happy every day.

05:18.767 --> 05:21.922
I can't wait to wake up
so tomorrow can start.

05:22.425 --> 05:24.420
<i>Countdown to wake-up time</i>

05:34.966 --> 05:36.681
Whoa...

05:38.677 --> 05:39.981
Uh-uh-uh.

05:39.985 --> 05:42.160
We're gonna start
this marriage off right.

05:42.166 --> 05:46.542
This time, I'm gonna carry you
over the threshold.

05:53.745 --> 05:54.880
Dear God!

05:54.886 --> 05:57.231
I need more nickels!

05:59.176 --> 06:02.642
Luann, is that you
nibbling on my knee?

06:05.628 --> 06:08.580
Check it out, an animal hole.

06:09.308 --> 06:10.952
Where does it go?

06:10.955 --> 06:12.611
Only one way to find out.

06:19.766 --> 06:22.153
Ah...! Tarantulas!

06:22.158 --> 06:24.820
I'll save you,
Baby Burps-A-Lot.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.350
Ah...! Spider burps!

06:33.796 --> 06:35.763
This week is the best.

06:35.768 --> 06:38.710
I don't care if my parent
sever come back.

06:53.948 --> 06:56.662
Milhouse Van Houten?

06:56.668 --> 06:58.253
Yes?

06:58.466 --> 07:02.042
Son, your parents
have been lost at sea.

07:02.047 --> 07:02.941
I'm sorry.

07:02.945 --> 07:04.381
Oh my God!

07:04.386 --> 07:07.091
I said I didn't care if
they ever came back!

07:07.098 --> 07:09.213
This is my fault!

07:10.718 --> 07:13.740
Drown, monster, drown!

07:16.857 --> 07:18.192
Hey, who died?

07:18.208 --> 07:20.911
My parents, probably.

07:20.915 --> 07:24.493
So you guys aren't
ice cream men?

07:28.865 --> 07:31.860
If my parents are lost at sea,

07:31.877 --> 07:33.952
are you gonna find 'em?

07:33.956 --> 07:37.343
We'll try, but have you ever
been to the sea?

07:37.345 --> 07:38.360
It's huge.

07:38.365 --> 07:39.672
And we have to search all of them--

07:39.687 --> 07:41.383
'cause they all,you know, connect.

07:42.298 --> 07:43.510
Don't worry, boy.

07:43.518 --> 07:45.332
They'll find your parents soon.

07:45.335 --> 07:47.930
And until they do, you can stay here.

07:47.936 --> 07:51.203
And we'll move your bedtime
to an hour later,

07:51.207 --> 07:54.570
so you'll have more time to
be alone with your thoughts.

08:01.191 --> 08:02.552
Hey, hey, come on.

08:02.551 --> 08:06.024
Why don't you cheer up
with a glass of Ocean Spray?

08:07.312 --> 08:08.773
Oh, boy forget that.

08:08.779 --> 08:09.652
How about some...?

08:09.657 --> 08:10.603
Cap'n crunch

08:11.535 --> 08:13.603
Uh, Seven Seas Italian dressing?

08:13.607 --> 08:14.843
Ooh! No, no!

08:14.845 --> 08:16.460
Uh, Chicken of the Sea tuna?

08:17.328 --> 08:20.181
Billy Ocean CD?
The History of Atlantic Records?

08:20.195 --> 08:21.551
Stop naming things!

08:21.557 --> 08:22.760
I want to, but I can't!

08:22.767 --> 08:24.153
Then go to Moe's!

08:24.156 --> 08:25.100
Good idea.

08:25.106 --> 08:27.450
I'll drown my sorrows
in Anchor Steam Beer.

08:27.455 --> 08:29.370
Oh! I'm sorry...

08:32.696 --> 08:36.419
Why don't we do something special for you
get you all snazzed up.

08:36.428 --> 08:38.770
Like I'm going to a funeral?

08:38.778 --> 08:40.693
No! Don't talk like that!

08:40.696 --> 08:42.222
There's always hope.

08:42.225 --> 08:44.761
We just wanted to let you know,
we've stopped searching.

08:46.185 --> 08:47.232
This'll cheer you up.

08:47.246 --> 08:50.163
I'll let you kill me in Bar Brawl Four: Final Fracas.

08:50.996 --> 08:53.250
Take that I'll cut ya...!

08:53.656 --> 08:55.592
Uh-oh. I slipped on some blood.

08:55.596 --> 08:57.250
I'm totally vulnerable to

08:57.255 --> 08:59.072
a full-body jukebox slam.

09:00.476 --> 09:02.430
Oh, come on, it's easy.

09:02.447 --> 09:06.352
Just push A, B, up, up, left trigger,
right trigger, and both triggers at once.

09:06.357 --> 09:09.921
Isn't there already enough pain in this world?

09:09.925 --> 09:13.211
Let's just pay the check and go.

09:27.938 --> 09:29.490
Thanks, Mags.

09:29.495 --> 09:32.000
I could use a pick-me-up.

09:38.836 --> 09:40.822
Oh, my God.

09:40.827 --> 09:43.501
I've become the world's oldest baby.

09:43.507 --> 09:46.593
Men don't get their moo-moo from a ba-ba.

09:47.955 --> 09:51.143
They get their moo-moo
from a big-boy cup!

09:53.517 --> 09:56.011
I can't be a baby anymore.

09:56.026 --> 09:57.491
I'm alone now.

09:57.498 --> 09:59.852
I have to be a man!

09:59.855 --> 10:01.403
Thanks, Mags.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.572
Where is it?

10:10.605 --> 10:14.183
I gotta find out what
color Marge's eyes are.

10:14.188 --> 10:14.910
Ah...

10:15.156 --> 10:16.853
Cha-ching!

10:19.667 --> 10:20.451
Oh!

10:21.125 --> 10:23.030
Oh, Marge, darling,

10:23.035 --> 10:25.953
what's the combination
to our wedding album?

10:25.955 --> 10:27.751
Our anniversary!

10:29.376 --> 10:30.113
D'oh!

10:31.848 --> 10:34.130
All right, Dragon's Eye,

10:34.145 --> 10:37.241
may your path be true
and your caroms many.

10:37.246 --> 10:38.492
Just shoot!

10:39.605 --> 10:41.912
Uh-oh, it's rolling to wards that loner!

10:41.916 --> 10:43.222
Who is it?

10:48.128 --> 10:49.800
It's Milhouse!

10:49.805 --> 10:52.151
That's not the Milhouse I know.

10:52.155 --> 10:52.953
Ha! ha!

10:52.957 --> 10:54.712
You know Milhouse!

10:54.926 --> 10:55.790
Okay, everyone.

10:55.796 --> 10:57.341
My best friend
is a little messed up,

10:57.345 --> 10:59.940
so everyone
be extra nice to him.

11:00.965 --> 11:02.191
Hey, loser, your mom called.

11:06.805 --> 11:10.521
One day, you'll be more haunted
by those words than I am.

11:11.008 --> 11:12.451
Why aren't you crying?

11:12.887 --> 11:14.633
I wish I could cry.

11:14.746 --> 11:16.820
Tears would cleanse my soul.

11:17.125 --> 11:18.450
Oh, Milhouse!

11:19.236 --> 11:21.363
You're very brave.

11:22.175 --> 11:23.922
Go ahead, beat me up.

11:24.275 --> 11:26.260
Maybe then I'll feel something.

11:32.987 --> 11:35.093
Eh, what's the point?

11:37.105 --> 11:39.890
Milhouse, that was the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

11:40.318 --> 11:42.721
I always wanted you
to hold my hand, Lisa.

11:42.978 --> 11:45.982
And now that you are, I'm
too numb to feel anything.

11:46.405 --> 11:49.650
It's like you're wearing oven mitts
and I'm in my winter parka.

11:50.856 --> 11:52.561
That's so poetic.

11:53.468 --> 11:56.073
Looks like you're not the coolest
kid in school anymore.

11:56.385 --> 11:59.191
Hey, I'm happy to see Milhouse
get some hand-on-hand action.

11:59.515 --> 12:02.801
But no one is cooler than
Bartholomew J. Simpson.

12:03.185 --> 12:05.921
Really?
See ya at lunch.

12:08.255 --> 12:10.311
Anyone want to sit over here?

12:10.637 --> 12:12.013
You can have my pizza crust.

12:12.696 --> 12:15.380
Young man, you look like
you enjoy fun and excitement.

12:15.706 --> 12:18.111
Please, Bart, you're
embarrassing yourself.

12:25.376 --> 12:28.001
Milhouse, call me
if you need to talk.

12:29.756 --> 12:33.571
If you want to come to my place,
I've got a squirrel in a shoebox.

12:33.978 --> 12:35.152
I'm just sayin'...

12:35.455 --> 12:38.293
Thanks, but I want to take
a walk alone...

12:39.748 --> 12:41.682
...and work some stuff out.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.883
Come on!
Look at me, I'm cool.

12:47.818 --> 12:49.671
I've got my backpack on frontwards,

12:49.976 --> 12:51.170
and I'm krumping!

12:55.026 --> 12:56.203
Check it out!

12:56.376 --> 12:58.052
This image has not been speed up.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.121
There's a time for krumping,
and this isn't it.

13:10.396 --> 13:12.453
I'll krump with you, sweetie pie.

13:28.067 --> 13:30.090
Look at these poll numbers.

13:31.005 --> 13:32.332
Ay, caramba!

13:33.066 --> 13:34.112
Oh, man.

13:34.446 --> 13:37.551
Milhouse has gone from being
a comic figure to a tragic one.

13:37.927 --> 13:39.461
If he could go back to being happy,

13:39.816 --> 13:41.112
I could go back to being cool.

13:41.647 --> 13:43.073
Boy, stop talking to yourself.

13:43.678 --> 13:45.233
Your thoughts should stay
in your head.

13:46.138 --> 13:47.192
I sure told him.

13:47.498 --> 13:49.703
Now what am I going
to do about Marge?

13:50.406 --> 13:51.333
Let's see.

13:51.607 --> 13:55.291
Milhouse would be happy again
if he had family to take care of him.

13:55.677 --> 13:57.332
Family, family.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.260
Every Christmas...

13:59.717 --> 14:02.151
Milhouse gets
Danish butter cookies from...

14:02.627 --> 14:04.433
Solvang, California...

14:04.937 --> 14:08.721
where he has a beloved un... cle!

14:11.285 --> 14:13.073
Directory assistance for Solvang,

14:13.346 --> 14:16.052
a little bit of Denmark
on California's central coast.

14:16.965 --> 14:18.413
We have three Van Houtens.

14:18.898 --> 14:20.872
Fine, I'll call three numbers.

14:21.325 --> 14:22.153
What are they?

14:22.457 --> 14:24.490
Butter cookie 8-2147,

14:24.796 --> 14:27.150
Hans Christian Anderson 5-5166,

14:27.426 --> 14:29.731
and Aquavit 3-2599.

14:41.786 --> 14:44.583
Okay, so which one of these losers

14:44.737 --> 14:46.441
is Milhouse's Uncle Norbert?

14:46.816 --> 14:48.282
Norbert? Norbert?

14:48.686 --> 14:50.330
Oh, this guy's a total Norbert.

14:50.515 --> 14:51.513
Norbert? I wish.

14:51.717 --> 14:54.281
My name is Gaylord Q. Tinkledink.

15:05.666 --> 15:08.470
Bart, I'm Norbert Van Houten,
but everyone calls me Zack.

15:08.748 --> 15:09.892
You're Uncle Norbert?

15:10.118 --> 15:12.072
Well, I'm one
of the Danish Van Houtens,

15:12.366 --> 15:14.940
not the Dutch Van Houtens.

15:15.246 --> 15:17.792
Now, my nephew Milhouse needs
me and I'm here for him.

15:18.017 --> 15:21.843
And I'm here to find my nephew
Nerdletaub Z. Pantybottom.

15:22.328 --> 15:24.242
Let us join forces.

15:26.517 --> 15:27.542
Would you be my uncle?

15:27.626 --> 15:29.270
No, but have a butter cookie.

15:38.588 --> 15:40.850
Milhouse, there's someone
who wants to see you.

15:43.536 --> 15:44.572
Uncle Zack?

15:44.806 --> 15:48.323
Milhouse, your parents may be
gone, but I'm here for you now.

15:48.777 --> 15:51.082
Well, I don't need you.

15:51.435 --> 15:53.423
I've learned to take care of myself.

15:53.885 --> 15:54.772
I see.

15:54.977 --> 15:56.320
You've become quite a young man--

15:56.558 --> 15:57.902
self-reliant, mature.

15:58.186 --> 16:00.880
You've shed your Dutch ways
and become a true Dane.

16:01.357 --> 16:03.480
But, uh, perhaps you're not too cool

16:03.636 --> 16:05.431
to give your uncle a hug?

16:07.786 --> 16:11.580
I promise you won't be
alone anymore, son.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.751
And that takes care of that.

16:21.486 --> 16:23.600
Oh, man, now he's
even more popular.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.352
He's troubled, but I can save him.

16:26.635 --> 16:28.502
Oh, for crying out loud.

16:30.977 --> 16:34.603
Oh, I'll never remember
what color Marge's eyes are.

16:35.008 --> 16:37.332
Uh... brown? No.

16:37.626 --> 16:38.930
Orange? No.

16:39.227 --> 16:41.603
Elm? Rake?
Guessing?

16:44.775 --> 16:48.420
Well, well, look who's strolling
down Alzheimer Avenue.

16:48.677 --> 16:51.083
You used to know everything
about that wife of yours,

16:51.307 --> 16:52.883
even wrote a song about her.

16:53.426 --> 16:54.683
A song?

16:55.236 --> 16:57.402
Wait, it's coming back to me.

17:00.625 --> 17:04.970
The girl I love's
got beautiful hair

17:05.477 --> 17:07.082
A blue bouffant

17:07.436 --> 17:09.981
From here to there

17:10.375 --> 17:12.153
Snow white teeth and lips so red

17:12.157 --> 17:13.930
She's the Wilma to my Fred

17:17.828 --> 17:20.342
Oh, the girl I love's got beautiful...

17:20.694 --> 17:21.609
Eyes

17:21.965 --> 17:25.362
When happy, they sparkle,
when sad, they cries

17:25.536 --> 17:27.829
Those eyes are gems beyond appraisal

17:28.017 --> 17:29.611
Stunning shade of purest...

17:30.016 --> 17:31.152
Oh, what is it?

17:31.466 --> 17:32.603
I was so close.

17:32.837 --> 17:34.211
Let's see, what rhymes
with appraisal?

17:34.515 --> 17:36.130
Basil, nasal.

17:36.636 --> 17:38.050
None of these are colors.

17:38.367 --> 17:39.381
Oh, it's hopeless.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.432
She'll never love me again.

17:42.037 --> 17:43.382
Oh, Homie.

17:43.618 --> 17:47.501
I'd forgotten that beautiful
song you wrote for me.

17:50.648 --> 17:51.793
Hazel!

17:52.096 --> 17:54.402
Your eyes are hazel.

17:54.847 --> 17:58.600
Hazel like the pussy willows
by the pond where we first kissed,

17:58.996 --> 18:01.090
like the almond paste
in the bear claw I ate

18:01.205 --> 18:03.203
after we first made love.

18:15.375 --> 18:16.983
Milhouse, that was a perfect landing.

18:17.388 --> 18:19.302
Oh, did you remember to
cut off the gas flow?

18:19.576 --> 18:20.521
The what?

18:27.116 --> 18:28.202
Lis, I don't get it.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.972
Why does Milhouse's happiness
make me sad?

18:31.298 --> 18:32.570
Bart, Bart, Bart.

18:32.805 --> 18:34.700
You're worried
you're losing Milhouse,

18:34.965 --> 18:36.850
and love is a selfish thing.

18:37.118 --> 18:39.063
Shut up! I don't love Milhouse.

18:39.278 --> 18:39.952
Oh, really?

18:40.176 --> 18:41.642
The more you deny it,
the more I know it's true.

18:41.877 --> 18:44.592
Oh, yeah? Well, when you're mean,
I'm a trampoline,

18:44.808 --> 18:46.953
so everything you said goes
back and hits your ugly head.

18:48.496 --> 18:50.750
God, that was lame.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.022
Where did you get that?

18:52.278 --> 18:53.300
From Milhouse!

18:53.845 --> 18:56.370
Oh, I love him so much!

18:56.898 --> 18:58.451
Aw, it's okay.

18:58.906 --> 19:01.770
Students, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.420
The coolest student in school,
Milhouse Van Houten,

19:04.545 --> 19:05.372
is leaving us.

19:06.877 --> 19:09.451
He and his uncle,
who is also very cool,

19:09.757 --> 19:13.291
will be returning to Solvang
forever via hot air balloon.

19:13.626 --> 19:16.203
Our trip will be fraught
with hardship and peril,

19:16.445 --> 19:18.973
but it still beats third-period
gym with Mr. Johnson.

19:20.526 --> 19:23.472
Hey, in the real world,
rope-climbing skills are vital.

19:24.057 --> 19:25.291
Good-bye, old life.

19:29.196 --> 19:30.271
Wait, Milhouse!

19:30.458 --> 19:31.151
Don't go!

19:31.555 --> 19:32.702
You're my best friend.

19:32.895 --> 19:34.003
I have to go.

19:34.156 --> 19:35.652
Well, then I'm going with you.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.672
Bart, climb up.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.353
I... can't.

19:40.625 --> 19:43.921
Well, what do you think of
Mr. Johnson's rope-climbing class now?

19:44.305 --> 19:46.653
- Still sucks!
- Come on.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.370
So who's up for a
trip around the world?

19:57.708 --> 19:59.043
I am, I am!

20:06.037 --> 20:07.730
If we can catch the trade winds,

20:07.855 --> 20:10.421
we'll be in the Florida Keys
by tomorrow morning.

20:16.356 --> 20:17.970
I can't wait to see our little...

20:18.578 --> 20:19.553
Milhouse!

20:20.235 --> 20:21.682
Mom and Dad!

20:21.868 --> 20:22.760
Mr. and Mrs. Van Houten!

20:23.025 --> 20:24.050
Damned Dutchmen!

20:30.336 --> 20:32.440
I'm so glad you're alive!

20:32.586 --> 20:35.251
I'll never have to be
self-reliant again.

20:35.457 --> 20:38.480
Not so fast, son.
We are trapped on this island.

20:38.665 --> 20:41.130
No worries. I've already
radioed for a rescue boat

20:41.358 --> 20:43.143
sailed by brave Danish sailors.

20:43.505 --> 20:45.832
More like swishy Danish sailors.

20:46.158 --> 20:47.681
You're going down, Dutchman.

20:49.426 --> 20:50.872
You grapple like a girl!
