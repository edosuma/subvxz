<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.000 --> 00:06.625
<i>Stardate 43930.7.</i>

00:06.625 --> 00:08.542
<i>The</i> Enterprise

00:06.625 --> 00:08.542
<i>has been in attendance</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:10.458
<i>at the biennial Trade</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:10.458
<i>Agreements Conference</i>

00:10.458 --> 00:12.166
<i>on Betazed.</i>

00:12.166 --> 00:14.375
<i>For the first time,</i>

00:12.166 --> 00:14.375
<i>the Ferengi are present</i>

00:14.375 --> 00:16.375
<i>and I have reluctantly</i>

00:14.375 --> 00:16.375
<i>consented</i>

00:16.375 --> 00:18.125
<i>to their boarding</i>

00:16.375 --> 00:18.125
<i>the</i> Enterprise

00:18.125 --> 00:20.000
<i>for the closing reception.</i>

00:20.000 --> 00:21.834
(<i> people talking, laughing</i> )

00:21.834 --> 00:23.834
(<i> rhythmic music playing</i> )

00:43.041 --> 00:45.500
Check and mate.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.834
WESLEY:

00:45.500 --> 00:47.834
Perfect.

00:47.834 --> 00:51.291
The Queen's Gambit, finished off

00:47.834 --> 00:51.291
with the Aldabren Exchange.

00:51.291 --> 00:53.458
Unfair.

00:53.458 --> 00:55.625
I-I couldn't concentrate

00:53.458 --> 00:55.625
with all that noise.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.083
WESLEY:

00:55.625 --> 00:57.083
Noise?

00:57.083 --> 00:59.291
It's Algolian

00:57.083 --> 00:59.291
ceremonial rhythms.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.291
(<i> snorts</i> )

01:08.041 --> 01:10.000
A toast to the success

01:10.000 --> 01:11.792
of the Trade Conference,

01:10.000 --> 01:11.792
Reittan.

01:11.792 --> 01:13.250
I must admit...

01:13.250 --> 01:15.959
I had some doubts

01:13.250 --> 01:15.959
when you invited the Ferengi.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.667
They made a profit

01:15.959 --> 01:17.667
and behaved themselves.

01:17.667 --> 01:18.959
What more

01:17.667 --> 01:18.959
could one ask?

01:18.959 --> 01:20.875
Still, they trouble me.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.709
We Betazeds are uncomfortable

01:22.709 --> 01:25.500
with species

01:22.709 --> 01:25.500
like the Ferengi

01:25.500 --> 01:27.291
whose minds we can't read.

01:27.291 --> 01:29.083
DATA:

01:27.291 --> 01:29.083
Perhaps your

01:27.291 --> 01:29.083
telepathic skills

01:29.083 --> 01:31.500
are ineffective owing

01:29.083 --> 01:31.500
to the anomalous construction

01:31.500 --> 01:33.250
of the Ferengi brain,

01:31.500 --> 01:33.250
which is composed

01:33.250 --> 01:34.250
of four different...

01:34.250 --> 01:35.792
Thank you, Mr. Data.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.583
It was thoughtful of you

01:35.792 --> 01:38.583
to invite Lwaxana Troi to be

01:38.583 --> 01:39.875
part of the Betazed

01:38.583 --> 01:39.875
delegation.

01:39.875 --> 01:42.542
REITTAN:

01:39.875 --> 01:42.542
Yes, Lwaxana and I

01:39.875 --> 01:42.542
go way back.

01:42.542 --> 01:44.375
Her first husband and

01:42.542 --> 01:44.375
I were old friends,

01:44.375 --> 01:46.417
and I've known Deanna

01:44.375 --> 01:46.417
since she was a child.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.166
I'm sure Counselor Troi

01:46.417 --> 01:48.166
appreciates the opportunity

01:48.166 --> 01:50.208
to spend time

01:48.166 --> 01:50.208
with her mother.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.750
LWAXANA:

01:50.208 --> 01:53.750
<i>Little One, you could at least</i>

01:50.208 --> 01:53.750
<i>pretend you're happy to see me.</i>

01:53.750 --> 01:57.125
Mother, we're

01:53.750 --> 01:57.125
among non-telepaths.

01:57.125 --> 01:59.625
It's impolite not

01:57.125 --> 01:59.625
to speak aloud.

01:59.625 --> 02:02.500
<i>You mean talk</i>

01:59.625 --> 02:02.500
<i>with my mouth full?</i>

02:02.500 --> 02:03.875
<i>Deanna, please.</i>

02:07.250 --> 02:08.500
Well, all right.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.291
You want me

02:08.500 --> 02:10.291
to say something aloud.

02:10.291 --> 02:13.166
Have you ever considered,

02:10.291 --> 02:13.166
if you'd stayed on Betazed,

02:13.166 --> 02:15.208
you might have been

02:13.166 --> 02:15.208
a happier person?

02:15.208 --> 02:17.959
Let's not guess

02:15.208 --> 02:17.959
what might have been.

02:17.959 --> 02:20.834
I love my work

02:17.959 --> 02:20.834
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

02:20.834 --> 02:22.417
Yes, of course you do,

02:22.417 --> 02:24.792
but it's all business

02:22.417 --> 02:24.792
and no play.

02:24.792 --> 02:27.166
You've got to enjoy life, relax.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.750
Like I do.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.667
Find yourself

02:28.750 --> 02:30.667
the right man.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.125
Think of your future.

02:32.125 --> 02:34.291
Think of<i> my</i> future.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.041
Lwaxana, Deanna.

02:36.041 --> 02:37.417
Anything I can do for you?

02:40.834 --> 02:42.792
Could I...?

02:50.667 --> 02:52.709
She's as repulsive

02:50.667 --> 02:52.709
as the rest of them.

02:52.709 --> 02:54.709
Repulsive?

02:54.709 --> 02:57.000
I find her exotic.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.375
And what an advantage

02:58.875 --> 03:01.375
her telepathy would be

03:01.375 --> 03:03.125
in our negotiations.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.709
To read our

03:03.125 --> 03:05.709
competitors' minds.

03:05.709 --> 03:08.041
Yes, that would

03:05.709 --> 03:08.041
be valuable.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.333
But she'd never agree

03:10.333 --> 03:12.625
to use her powers

03:10.333 --> 03:12.625
to help us.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.583
I'm not so sure.

03:16.917 --> 03:20.417
Lwaxana Troi of

03:16.917 --> 03:20.417
Betazed, I believe.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.166
I am DaiMon Tog

03:22.166 --> 03:23.709
of the Ferengi vessel<i> Krayton.</i>

03:23.709 --> 03:24.667
May I join you?

03:24.667 --> 03:26.208
I was just

03:24.667 --> 03:26.208
going to see

03:26.208 --> 03:27.208
Captain Picard.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.375
Excuse me.

03:34.959 --> 03:36.250
Oh, Jean-Luc. Jean-Luc!

03:36.250 --> 03:37.792
Come have a drink with me.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.417
Tell me what you've been up to.

03:39.417 --> 03:40.875
Perhaps later, Lwaxana.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.542
Mr. Data and I were about

03:40.875 --> 03:43.542
to show Reittan Grax

03:43.542 --> 03:45.583
the, um... the, um...

03:45.583 --> 03:48.583
the new door mechanisms

03:45.583 --> 03:48.583
on the aft turbolifts.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.125
If you'll excuse us.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.625
Lwaxana Troi,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.625
I desire you.

03:59.625 --> 04:01.375
What?

04:01.375 --> 04:05.250
You see, your Betazoid

04:01.375 --> 04:05.250
skills would be

04:01.375 --> 04:05.250
very useful to me,

04:05.250 --> 04:07.417
and I find you

04:05.250 --> 04:07.417
very attractive.

04:07.417 --> 04:12.000
I am willing to pay

04:07.417 --> 04:12.000
handsomely for you.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.875
I don't believe this.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.792
You must be aware

04:15.792 --> 04:19.000
that every female has her price.

04:25.208 --> 04:28.625
Let's get one thing

04:25.208 --> 04:28.625
straight, little man.

04:28.625 --> 04:30.375
I am not for sale.

04:30.375 --> 04:34.000
And if, by some chance,

04:30.375 --> 04:34.000
I were to become available,

04:34.000 --> 04:35.542
I would rather eat

04:35.542 --> 04:38.041
Orion wing-slugs than

04:35.542 --> 04:38.041
deal with a toad-faced

04:38.041 --> 04:40.000
<i>troll</i> like you!

04:40.000 --> 04:43.333
So go away and find yourself

04:40.000 --> 04:43.333
somebody else to become

04:43.333 --> 04:44.792
your property.

04:44.792 --> 04:47.041
As you wish.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.875
Now that you've totally

04:50.375 --> 04:53.875
humiliated us,

04:53.875 --> 04:56.750
may we return

04:53.875 --> 04:56.750
to our vessel?

04:56.750 --> 05:00.625
She is exhilarating,

04:56.750 --> 05:00.625
isn't she?

05:00.625 --> 05:02.041
(<i> chuckles</i> )

05:02.041 --> 05:06.291
And now I want her

05:02.041 --> 05:06.291
more than ever.

05:06.291 --> 05:10.000
Lwaxana Troi, you will be mine.

05:37.875 --> 05:42.250
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

05:42.250 --> 05:46.250
<i>These are the voyages</i>

05:42.250 --> 05:46.250
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

05:48.125 --> 05:52.125
<i>to explore</i>

05:48.125 --> 05:52.125
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

05:52.125 --> 05:56.667
<i>to seek out new life</i>

05:52.125 --> 05:56.667
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

05:56.667 --> 06:01.166
<i>to boldly go</i>

05:56.667 --> 06:01.166
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

07:02.333 --> 07:04.625
Are we at war

07:02.333 --> 07:04.625
with the Ferengi yet?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.709
DaiMon Tog has returned

07:04.625 --> 07:06.709
to his vessel

07:06.709 --> 07:08.375
and the Ferengi

07:06.709 --> 07:08.375
have left orbit.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.667
My mother will be relieved.

07:10.667 --> 07:13.083
I hear she handled

07:10.667 --> 07:13.083
the situation

07:13.083 --> 07:14.792
quite skillfully.

07:14.792 --> 07:16.792
An admirable woman.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.959
I'll be sure to tell her

07:16.792 --> 07:18.959
you said so.

07:18.959 --> 07:21.959
LWAXANA:

07:18.959 --> 07:21.959
<i>Come in, Little One.</i>

07:21.959 --> 07:23.625
(<i> sighs</i> )

07:27.125 --> 07:30.667
Mother?

07:30.667 --> 07:33.792
Mother, please.

07:36.083 --> 07:37.625
Oh...

07:37.625 --> 07:41.375
Oh, after that awful

07:37.625 --> 07:41.375
little Ferengi insulted me,

07:41.375 --> 07:43.375
I needed to center myself.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.458
Can you imagine

07:43.375 --> 07:46.458
that dreadful little creature

07:46.458 --> 07:48.041
talking to me like that?

07:48.041 --> 07:49.667
Doesn't he realize

07:49.667 --> 07:53.083
that I am the daughter

07:49.667 --> 07:53.083
of the Fifth House of Betazed,

07:53.083 --> 07:55.709
Holder of the Sacred Chalice

07:53.083 --> 07:55.709
of Rixx?

07:55.709 --> 07:59.333
The Sacred Chalice of Rixx

07:55.709 --> 07:59.333
is an old clay pot

07:59.333 --> 08:01.417
with mold growing

07:59.333 --> 08:01.417
inside it.

08:01.417 --> 08:04.125
Oh, well, perhaps one day,

08:01.417 --> 08:04.125
when you're older and wiser,

08:04.125 --> 08:05.959
you'll understand.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.458
Come on, Little One, sit down.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.917
Talk to me.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.625
We spend

08:08.917 --> 08:10.625
so little time together.

08:10.625 --> 08:12.625
That's true.

08:12.625 --> 08:17.625
I'm sorry, and I didn't mean

08:12.625 --> 08:17.625
to get so upset with you

08:17.625 --> 08:19.583
at the reception.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.375
Oh, no.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.375
Deanna, try to understand.

08:22.375 --> 08:24.125
You're all I have.

08:24.125 --> 08:27.000
My only concern

08:24.125 --> 08:27.000
is for your happiness.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.875
I am happy.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.417
Why can't you believe that?

08:31.417 --> 08:35.000
Oh, I wish I could,

08:31.417 --> 08:35.000
but how much happiness is there

08:35.000 --> 08:37.917
in always being there

08:35.000 --> 08:37.917
for someone else

08:37.917 --> 08:39.500
and never being there

08:37.917 --> 08:39.500
for yourself?

08:39.500 --> 08:42.792
I get a great deal

08:39.500 --> 08:42.792
of satisfaction out of my work.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.417
Oh, well, I'm sure you do.

08:44.417 --> 08:46.834
I'm sure it's very rewarding

08:44.417 --> 08:46.834
in its way, but...

08:46.834 --> 08:47.959
(<i> sighs</i> )

08:47.959 --> 08:50.000
...what about a family?

08:50.000 --> 08:53.250
This is my family--

08:53.250 --> 08:55.834
my friends,

08:53.250 --> 08:55.834
here on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

08:55.834 --> 08:58.959
All right, in case I have

08:55.834 --> 08:58.959
to spell it out for you,

08:58.959 --> 09:02.625
I am talking about finding

08:58.959 --> 09:02.625
a husband, having a child.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.333
That's what made me happy.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.917
At least, until now.

09:05.917 --> 09:10.792
Mother, look, perhaps

09:05.917 --> 09:10.792
someday I will marry,

09:10.792 --> 09:13.458
but you have to let me

09:10.792 --> 09:13.458
make my own choices,

09:13.458 --> 09:16.375
live my own life,

09:13.458 --> 09:16.375
and not the life

09:16.375 --> 09:17.834
that you would

09:16.375 --> 09:17.834
choose for me.

09:17.834 --> 09:20.667
You had your chance

09:17.834 --> 09:20.667
with Commander Riker.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.375
Look how you ruined that.

09:22.375 --> 09:23.875
I did not ruin anything.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.166
We've become

09:23.875 --> 09:26.166
very good friends.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.625
Well, all the better.

09:27.625 --> 09:30.750
You certainly wouldn't want

09:27.625 --> 09:30.750
to marry an enemy.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.917
I see we can't talk

09:30.750 --> 09:32.917
about this.

09:32.917 --> 09:36.375
Very well, have it your own way,

09:32.917 --> 09:36.375
Little One.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.667
Little One?!

09:37.667 --> 09:40.709
You called me that

09:37.667 --> 09:40.709
when I was five.

09:40.709 --> 09:44.750
Now stop demeaning me

09:40.709 --> 09:44.750
and address me as an adult.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.375
<i>I'll be home on Betazed</i>

09:46.750 --> 09:49.375
<i>if you need me, Little...</i>

09:49.375 --> 09:51.625
<i>Deanna.</i>

09:55.500 --> 09:58.166
Adding preprocessors

09:55.500 --> 09:58.166
to the neutrino counters

09:58.166 --> 09:59.667
boosted efficiency by 11%.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.792
Of course, Commander La Forge

09:59.667 --> 10:01.792
and Commander Data

10:01.792 --> 10:02.834
did most of the work...

10:02.834 --> 10:04.208
Not so fast, Wesley.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.333
Reprocessing the data

10:04.208 --> 10:06.333
with an optical chip

10:06.333 --> 10:07.500
was your idea.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.625
That is correct, sir.

10:09.625 --> 10:12.041
Although Commander La Forge

10:09.625 --> 10:12.041
and I designed the chip,

10:12.041 --> 10:14.792
Mr. Crusher derived the equation

10:12.041 --> 10:14.792
governing its operation.

10:14.792 --> 10:17.417
The point is, you completed the

10:14.792 --> 10:17.417
upgrade well ahead of schedule.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.500
Very impressive.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.667
Indeed. Fine work.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.583
We shall miss you,

10:20.667 --> 10:22.583
Mr. Crusher.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.458
As you've guessed, final

10:22.583 --> 10:25.458
entrance examination scores

10:25.458 --> 10:27.834
from Starfleet Academy

10:25.458 --> 10:27.834
have arrived.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.166
Congratulations.

10:29.166 --> 10:31.583
As soon as you have

10:29.166 --> 10:31.583
completed the oral exam,

10:31.583 --> 10:33.500
you'll be formally admitted.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.375
We'll have you

10:33.500 --> 10:35.375
back at Betazed

10:33.500 --> 10:35.375
in plenty of time

10:35.375 --> 10:37.291
to meet up with the

10:35.375 --> 10:37.291
Academy transport ship.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.917
Thank you, sir.

10:38.917 --> 10:40.709
That'll be all.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.709
Number One, a moment.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.041
Yes, Captain?

10:46.041 --> 10:49.250
You'll agree that this is a

10:46.041 --> 10:49.250
fairly routine mapping mission?

10:49.250 --> 10:50.458
Yes, sir.

10:51.875 --> 10:53.750
Counselor Troi

10:51.875 --> 10:53.750
had the good sense

10:53.750 --> 10:55.291
to<i> ask</i> for shore leave.

10:55.291 --> 10:58.250
I can see I'm going to have

10:55.291 --> 10:58.250
to<i> suggest</i> it to you.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.458
Have a good time, Number One.

11:10.250 --> 11:13.250
(<i> indistinct conversation</i> )

11:20.333 --> 11:21.542
(<i> Deanna laughing</i> )

11:21.542 --> 11:23.375
RIKER:

11:21.542 --> 11:23.375
...your mother.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.792
I think it's around here

11:26.083 --> 11:27.792
somewhere.

11:27.792 --> 11:29.083
Well, maybe it died.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.625
It has been a few years.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.208
<i>Muktok</i> live

11:30.625 --> 11:33.208
for hundreds of years.

11:33.208 --> 11:34.834
Here it is.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.125
Oh!

11:36.125 --> 11:41.500
Oh... oh, it's lovely.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.291
(<i> musical tinkling</i> )

11:43.291 --> 11:45.667
I remember that sound

11:45.667 --> 11:49.083
and all the good times we had.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.959
I remember a certain

11:49.083 --> 11:52.959
junior officer

11:52.959 --> 11:56.834
meeting a very serious

11:52.959 --> 11:56.834
psychology student.

11:56.834 --> 12:00.333
The best part about

11:56.834 --> 12:00.333
being assigned to Betazed.

12:03.166 --> 12:05.792
LWAXANA:

12:03.166 --> 12:05.792
Ah, this is the perfect spot.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.792
Put the food down

12:05.792 --> 12:07.792
over there, Mr. Homn.

12:07.792 --> 12:11.709
Oh, isn't it a beautiful day

12:07.792 --> 12:11.709
for a picnic?

12:11.709 --> 12:13.709
(<i> sighing</i> )

12:11.709 --> 12:13.709
Oh, they'll be joining us

12:11.709 --> 12:13.709
in a moment.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.583
No, no, not that.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.583
Here, I-I-I...

12:15.583 --> 12:17.250
Put the food over there.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.709
No, no, you can

12:17.250 --> 12:18.709
go back...

12:18.709 --> 12:21.792
Mother, how did you know

12:18.709 --> 12:21.792
about this place?

12:21.792 --> 12:24.834
Your father used

12:21.792 --> 12:24.834
to bring me here.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.208
Sit down.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.375
RIKER:

12:26.208 --> 12:28.375
And you even brought provisions.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.834
Very thoughtful.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.834
Here, Will, Deanna.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.458
Try an oskoid.

12:33.458 --> 12:35.250
They're delicious.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.083
You see, that sap

12:41.083 --> 12:43.083
running through the veins

12:41.083 --> 12:43.083
helps keep it warm.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.333
Very tasty.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.125
So, tell us, Lwaxana,

12:48.333 --> 12:50.125
the last time we met,

12:50.125 --> 12:51.583
you were looking

12:50.125 --> 12:51.583
for a husband.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.083
Have you had any luck?

12:53.083 --> 12:58.959
Alas, no, but what happens to me

12:53.083 --> 12:58.959
isn't important.

12:58.959 --> 13:00.625
I am much more concerned

13:00.625 --> 13:03.542
with other people

13:00.625 --> 13:03.542
getting on with their lives.

13:03.542 --> 13:05.041
Mother.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.917
Mr. Homn,

13:07.917 --> 13:11.500
I noticed some uttaberries

13:07.917 --> 13:11.500
back along the path.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.709
Pick some.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.000
Well, Mr. Homn and I

13:15.250 --> 13:18.000
could go back home

13:18.000 --> 13:20.041
if you two

13:18.000 --> 13:20.041
would like to be alone.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.291
It's, uh,

13:20.041 --> 13:22.291
such a romantic setting.

13:22.291 --> 13:23.667
Mother, stop it!

13:23.667 --> 13:26.792
Darling, you have been

13:23.667 --> 13:26.792
so excitable lately.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.667
Have you ever thought

13:28.667 --> 13:29.709
of a leave of absence?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.291
I could talk

13:29.709 --> 13:31.291
to Jean-Luc.

13:31.291 --> 13:32.709
Try the oskoid.

13:32.709 --> 13:33.875
Very different.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.083
(<i> hum of an active transport)</i>

13:39.291 --> 13:40.917
What the...?

13:39.291 --> 13:40.917
Oh.

13:40.917 --> 13:43.500
For one whose beauty surpasses

13:40.917 --> 13:43.500
even these pericules.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.083
DaiMon Tog,

13:45.083 --> 13:47.458
I thought the<i> Krayton</i>

13:45.083 --> 13:47.458
left orbit hours ago.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.000
It did.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.709
But when I tried to get

13:49.000 --> 13:51.709
the image of Lwaxana Troi

13:51.709 --> 13:54.166
out of my mind,

13:51.709 --> 13:54.166
I could not succeed.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.875
This is ludicrous.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.959
You mean, you came all the way

13:56.875 --> 13:59.959
back to Betazed for me?

13:59.959 --> 14:01.709
Why continue to search

13:59.959 --> 14:01.709
for perfection

14:01.709 --> 14:03.875
once you have

14:01.709 --> 14:03.875
found it?

14:03.875 --> 14:06.583
I don't believe this.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.083
Now, look,<i> demon</i> Tog

14:08.083 --> 14:09.500
or whatever

14:08.083 --> 14:09.500
you call yourself,

14:09.500 --> 14:11.208
I am the daughter

14:09.500 --> 14:11.208
of the Fifth House,

14:11.208 --> 14:13.166
Holder of

14:11.208 --> 14:13.166
the Scared Chalice of Rixx,

14:13.166 --> 14:14.875
Heir to the Holy Rings

14:13.166 --> 14:14.875
of Betazed,

14:14.875 --> 14:17.500
and unless you want to create

14:14.875 --> 14:17.500
an interstellar incident,

14:17.500 --> 14:19.333
you had better

14:17.500 --> 14:19.333
beam back to your ship.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.917
Returning to my ship

14:19.333 --> 14:21.917
is exactly what I had in mind.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.500
<i>Krayton,</i> transport four

14:23.166 --> 14:25.500
immediately.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.291
No, Tog...

14:44.667 --> 14:47.792
FERENGI:

14:44.667 --> 14:47.792
Pawn takes Knight,

14:44.667 --> 14:47.792
King's Level.

14:47.792 --> 14:50.333
(<i> chuckling</i> )

14:57.709 --> 15:01.750
FERENGI 2:

14:57.709 --> 15:01.750
Bishop takes Knight,

14:57.709 --> 15:01.750

15:08.792 --> 15:10.917
Rook to Queen Four.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.208
(<i> groans</i> )

15:13.208 --> 15:15.250
(<i> Ferengi chuckling</i> )

15:17.667 --> 15:19.625
Lwaxana?

15:19.625 --> 15:21.458
Oh...

15:21.458 --> 15:23.250
Deanna?

15:23.250 --> 15:24.458
Where are we?

15:24.458 --> 15:26.041
From the smell

15:24.458 --> 15:26.041
of things

15:26.041 --> 15:28.458
I'd say we're aboard

15:26.041 --> 15:28.458
a Ferengi vessel.

15:28.458 --> 15:29.667
The Ferengi can't do that.

15:29.667 --> 15:30.959
You're Starfleet officers.

15:30.959 --> 15:32.792
Well, Tog must not

15:30.959 --> 15:32.792
have read that chapter

15:32.792 --> 15:34.417
in the Ferengi

15:32.792 --> 15:34.417
<i>Book of Etiquette.</i>

15:34.417 --> 15:36.000
<i>Enterprise?</i>

15:38.041 --> 15:40.542
Must be too far

15:38.041 --> 15:40.542
out of range.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.792
Oh...

15:48.750 --> 15:50.000
(<i> yelps</i> )

15:50.000 --> 15:51.375
(<i> both gasp</i> )

15:51.375 --> 15:54.250
DaiMon, they have

15:51.375 --> 15:54.250
regained consciousness.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.792
Very good.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.083
(<i> gasps</i> )

16:07.083 --> 16:08.625
I should have known.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.583
Even their transporters

16:08.625 --> 16:11.583
can't be trusted.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.500
Why have you removed

16:16.500 --> 16:17.875
our clothing?

16:17.875 --> 16:21.500
Females do not deserve

16:17.875 --> 16:21.500
the honor of clothing.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.667
They're as bad as humans.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.166
Look at that leer

16:22.667 --> 16:24.166
on his face.

16:28.834 --> 16:33.417
No, his is an expression

16:28.834 --> 16:33.417
of revulsion,

16:33.417 --> 16:36.333
but it is a feeling that

16:33.417 --> 16:36.333
I do not share, Lwaxana.

16:44.542 --> 16:45.709
Oh, uh...

16:45.709 --> 16:47.041
Well, it's cold in here.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.750
Do you want me to become ill?

16:49.750 --> 16:51.417
You must forgive the Doctor.

16:51.417 --> 16:54.750
He is not accustomed to dealing

16:51.417 --> 16:54.750
with Betazoid females.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.333
Now, Lwaxana,

16:57.333 --> 17:00.458
I have a, uh,

16:57.333 --> 17:00.458
business proposition for you.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.625
Thanks, but I'm not interested

17:00.458 --> 17:02.625
in any of your propositions.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.333
Hear me out.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.333
Your telepathic powers could

17:04.333 --> 17:07.333
bring us both great profit.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.417
Huh. Why would I want

17:07.333 --> 17:09.417
to bring you profit?

17:09.417 --> 17:14.333
In order to keep your daughter

17:09.417 --> 17:14.333
alive and healthy, for one.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.959
TOG:

17:14.333 --> 17:16.959
There is no need for threats.

17:16.959 --> 17:19.750
Lwaxana is a sensible female.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.750
<i>I don't like the sound of this,</i>

17:19.750 --> 17:21.750
<i>Mother.</i>

17:21.750 --> 17:25.000
<i>I believe I can control him,</i>

17:21.750 --> 17:25.000
<i>Little One.</i>

17:25.000 --> 17:28.959
I'm sure that, uh...

17:25.000 --> 17:28.959
we can talk about this.

17:28.959 --> 17:31.792
Just the<i> two</i> of us.

17:31.792 --> 17:34.667
A wise choice.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.625
Farek, leave us.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.000
Wel...

17:45.333 --> 17:47.333
And you may rejoin

17:47.333 --> 17:48.375
your friend.

17:48.375 --> 17:49.959
<i>Mother, are you sure?</i>

17:49.959 --> 17:51.750
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

17:52.750 --> 17:54.000
(<i> console beeps</i> )

18:00.375 --> 18:01.917
Mm.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.500
(<i> chuckles nervously</i> )

18:09.500 --> 18:12.083
And now, Lwaxana Troi...

18:12.083 --> 18:15.000
let us talk.

18:34.959 --> 18:37.917
15 hours from Gamma Erandi

18:34.959 --> 18:37.917
and already the subspace static

18:37.917 --> 18:39.959
is playing hell

18:37.917 --> 18:39.959
with the communications.

18:39.959 --> 18:42.458
Just what you'd expect

18:39.959 --> 18:42.458
from a stellar nursery.

18:42.458 --> 18:43.834
Wesley, congratulations

18:43.834 --> 18:46.333
on passing your Starfleet

18:43.834 --> 18:46.333
written examination.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.667
An excellent achievement.

18:47.667 --> 18:49.125
Thanks, Data.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.417
Now, if I can just do as

18:49.125 --> 18:51.417
well on the oral exams.

18:51.417 --> 18:52.583
Not to worry, you will.

18:52.583 --> 18:54.041
And when you return,

18:54.041 --> 18:56.333
we'll be gaining the best ensign

18:54.041 --> 18:56.333
in the fleet.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.917
There is no guarantee

18:57.917 --> 19:00.542
that Wesley will be reassigned

18:57.917 --> 19:00.542
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

19:00.542 --> 19:03.959
91% of Starfleet graduates

19:00.542 --> 19:03.959
are not posted

19:03.959 --> 19:06.417
to Galaxy-class starships

19:03.959 --> 19:06.417
on their first assignment.

19:06.417 --> 19:08.333
I never thought of that.

19:08.333 --> 19:11.083
I always assumed I'd be

19:08.333 --> 19:11.083
coming back to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

19:11.083 --> 19:14.041
Well, I'm sure Captain Picard

19:11.083 --> 19:14.041
will request you.

19:14.041 --> 19:15.667
That is, if he's still

19:15.667 --> 19:18.959
commanding the<i> Enterprise</i>

19:15.667 --> 19:18.959
when you graduate.

19:18.959 --> 19:22.458
I never thought of that either.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.625
I never thought

19:22.458 --> 19:24.625
I'd feel this way

19:24.625 --> 19:27.166
about leaving you guys

19:24.625 --> 19:27.166
and the<i> Enterprise.</i>

19:27.166 --> 19:29.667
Is that not part

19:27.166 --> 19:29.667
of the human experience?

19:29.667 --> 19:31.125
Growth and change?

19:31.125 --> 19:32.375
Well, I suppose so, but...

19:32.375 --> 19:34.542
Listen, Wesley,

19:32.375 --> 19:34.542
I felt the same way

19:34.542 --> 19:36.375
when I left my family

19:34.542 --> 19:36.375
to go to the Academy,

19:36.375 --> 19:38.333
but it was one

19:36.375 --> 19:38.333
of the best times of my life.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.709
You're going to meet new friends

19:38.333 --> 19:40.709
and have adventures

19:40.709 --> 19:42.709
that you can't

19:40.709 --> 19:42.709
even imagine yet.

19:42.709 --> 19:44.667
I hope you're right, Geordi.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.792
LWAXANA:

19:47.083 --> 19:48.792
<i>Oh, Little One,</i>

19:48.792 --> 19:51.750
<i>Tog's given me something</i>

19:48.792 --> 19:51.750
<i>perfectly hideous to wear.</i>

19:51.750 --> 19:53.291
<i>He says it flatters my beauty.</i>

19:53.291 --> 19:54.709
(<i> chuckles</i> )

20:01.458 --> 20:04.166
So far, Mother's

20:01.458 --> 20:04.166
in no danger.

20:04.166 --> 20:08.291
I hope she knows

20:04.166 --> 20:08.291
what she's doing.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.750
Well, she's bought us

20:08.291 --> 20:09.750
some time.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.041
Let's make the most of it.

20:13.625 --> 20:14.709
I wouldn't do that.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.834
I don't need your help.

20:17.834 --> 20:19.291
The hell you don't.

20:19.291 --> 20:21.375
You're two moves away

20:19.291 --> 20:21.375
from being mated.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.000
(<i> growls</i> )

20:27.000 --> 20:28.625
See? You should have

20:27.000 --> 20:28.625
listened to me.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.500
Now you've only got

20:28.625 --> 20:30.500
one possible escape...

20:30.500 --> 20:32.041
(<i> grunts</i> )

20:38.166 --> 20:39.291
That wasn't it.

20:41.583 --> 20:44.208
(<i> laughs</i> )

20:45.542 --> 20:47.166
You should have moved

20:45.542 --> 20:47.166
the bishop.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.667
Ridiculous!

20:47.166 --> 20:49.667
The bishop was pinned.

20:49.667 --> 20:51.083
Don't listen to me.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.041
Forget the fact

20:51.083 --> 20:54.041
that I beat you in 30 moves.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.750
Pure luck.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.000
I was being polite.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.333
I could have won in 20.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.000
Then prove it.

21:08.959 --> 21:12.959
Pawn to Queen Four,

21:08.959 --> 21:12.959
King's Level.

21:12.959 --> 21:16.458
Pawn to King's Bishop Three,

21:12.959 --> 21:16.458
Queen's Level.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.583
I must admit, when you, uh,

21:24.083 --> 21:27.583
first approached me

21:27.583 --> 21:31.083
aboard the<i> Enterprise,</i>

21:27.583 --> 21:31.083
I was... intrigued.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.917
(<i> chuckles</i> ):

21:31.083 --> 21:32.917
You mean revolted.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.667
Perhaps a little.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.875
Do you forgive me?

21:36.875 --> 21:39.041
Yes.

21:39.041 --> 21:41.041
But with your powers,

21:41.041 --> 21:44.792
we could be a

21:41.041 --> 21:44.792
formidable team.

21:46.834 --> 21:51.750
My, you have great strength

21:46.834 --> 21:51.750
in your hands.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.667
And you like that?

21:53.667 --> 21:57.959
(<i> sighs</i> ):

21:53.667 --> 21:57.959
I have always admired

21:53.667 --> 21:57.959
strong males.

21:57.959 --> 22:00.583
You are beautiful.

22:00.583 --> 22:04.875
It is impossible

22:00.583 --> 22:04.875
for me to resist you.

22:04.875 --> 22:09.000
Then, uh... don't.

22:30.834 --> 22:34.625
Initial scans of ionization

22:30.834 --> 22:34.625
patterns complete, sir.

22:34.625 --> 22:37.125
Now correlating sensor readings.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.000
It's almost

22:39.500 --> 22:43.000
incomprehensible--

22:43.000 --> 22:45.417
the amount of energy

22:43.000 --> 22:45.417
being expended.

22:45.417 --> 22:49.834
Actually, it is 5.34 times

22:45.417 --> 22:49.834
ten to the 41st watt, sir.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.959
Well within the norm for

22:49.834 --> 22:51.959
this type of phenomenon.

22:51.959 --> 22:53.959
Yes, yes, yes, perhaps, Data.

22:55.250 --> 22:58.417
But that takes away

22:55.250 --> 22:58.417
none of the wonder.

23:05.792 --> 23:07.291
Check.

23:07.291 --> 23:08.750
I'm sick of this game.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.834
Of course, now that

23:08.750 --> 23:10.834
you are losing.

23:10.834 --> 23:12.083
Who's losing?

23:12.083 --> 23:14.166
I'm just tired of standing up.

23:14.166 --> 23:16.208
You can't resign now.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.500
It's hard to play from in here.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.959
I can't even see

23:17.500 --> 23:18.959
the whole board.

23:18.959 --> 23:20.291
Ah.

23:20.291 --> 23:22.125
Then you'll finish the game

23:20.291 --> 23:22.125
if I let you

23:22.125 --> 23:23.542
out of the cell?

23:23.542 --> 23:24.667
I might.

23:24.667 --> 23:26.291
(<i> laughs</i> )

23:26.291 --> 23:28.166
Clever, human,

23:26.291 --> 23:28.166
but I'm not that foolish.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.500
What, do you think

23:28.166 --> 23:30.500
I'm going to try to escape?

23:30.500 --> 23:31.667
What would that get me?

23:31.667 --> 23:33.000
You've already got her.

23:35.792 --> 23:37.375
Besides, where would I go?

23:37.375 --> 23:40.375
I do not trust you.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.834
Fine.

23:41.834 --> 23:43.375
Thanks for the game.

23:52.834 --> 23:54.709
Come out here.

24:09.291 --> 24:12.750
Now save your

24:09.291 --> 24:12.750
rook, if you can.

24:17.041 --> 24:19.709
...and that was

24:17.041 --> 24:19.709
my first husband.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.125
Not much

24:19.709 --> 24:22.125
of a conversationalist

24:22.125 --> 24:26.375
but, uh... what a lover.

24:26.375 --> 24:29.625
Well, then I met...

24:29.625 --> 24:33.834
I do not want to hear

24:29.625 --> 24:33.834
about your other romances.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.917
It makes me jealous.

24:37.875 --> 24:43.375
My, my, what, uh...

24:37.875 --> 24:43.375
big ears you have.

24:43.375 --> 24:46.667
Has anyone ever told you

24:43.375 --> 24:46.667
how attractive they are?

24:46.667 --> 24:47.750
Some females

24:47.750 --> 24:49.417
think they are my best feature.

24:51.250 --> 24:56.083
No one has ever given me

24:51.250 --> 24:56.083
<i>oo-mox</i> like this before.

24:56.083 --> 24:57.667
<i>Oo-mox?</i>

24:57.667 --> 25:00.083
There's no translation,

25:00.083 --> 25:03.834
but the ear is

25:00.083 --> 25:03.834
one of our most

25:03.834 --> 25:04.959
erogenous zones.

25:06.125 --> 25:10.583
Those Ferengi

25:06.125 --> 25:10.583
have iron jaws.

25:10.583 --> 25:14.917
LWAXANA:

25:10.583 --> 25:14.917
<i>Little One, if Tog were</i>

25:10.583 --> 25:14.917
<i>a kitten, he'd be purring.</i>

25:14.917 --> 25:16.667
Good work, Mother.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.166
According to Mother,

25:18.166 --> 25:21.667
DaiMon Tog is extremely

25:18.166 --> 25:21.667
relaxed at the moment.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.583
Tell Lwaxana

25:21.667 --> 25:23.583
to keep him relaxed

25:23.583 --> 25:25.625
while we call in the cavalry.

25:25.625 --> 25:29.083
COMPUTER:

25:25.625 --> 25:29.083
Access to communications denied.

25:29.083 --> 25:32.291
All transmissions

25:29.083 --> 25:32.291
to be authorized by DaiMon Tog.

25:34.458 --> 25:38.250
Let's see just how

25:34.458 --> 25:38.250
relaxed DaiMon Tog is.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.542
<i>Mother, we're out of the cell</i>

25:40.542 --> 25:42.417
<i>and we're trying</i>

25:40.542 --> 25:42.417
<i>to contact the</i> Enterprise,

25:42.417 --> 25:44.250
<i>but we can't do it</i>

25:42.417 --> 25:44.250
<i>without Tog's access code.</i>

25:44.250 --> 25:45.667
<i>Do you think</i>

25:44.250 --> 25:45.667
<i>you could manage to...</i>

25:45.667 --> 25:49.083
LWAXANA:

25:45.667 --> 25:49.083
<i>Say no more, Little One.</i>

25:49.083 --> 25:54.041
Lwaxana, you and I are going

25:49.083 --> 25:54.041
to make such a wonderful team.

25:54.041 --> 25:58.500
With your telepathy

25:54.041 --> 25:58.500
and my cunning, I foresee...

25:58.500 --> 26:00.667
A very profitable future.

26:00.667 --> 26:02.500
(<i> chuckles in agreement</i> )

26:09.125 --> 26:12.125
Subspace interference

26:09.125 --> 26:12.125
is subsiding, sir.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.208
Communications

26:12.125 --> 26:14.208
have been restored.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.375
Good.

26:15.375 --> 26:17.709
Contact Commander Riker

26:15.375 --> 26:17.709
on Betazed.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.792
Message coming in

26:17.709 --> 26:19.792
from Betazed, sir.

26:19.792 --> 26:21.166
Priority one.

26:22.375 --> 26:24.375
On screen.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.125
Captain Picard, at last.

26:26.125 --> 26:28.208
We have been trying to reach you

26:26.125 --> 26:28.208
for two days.

26:28.208 --> 26:30.458
Our communications have been

26:28.208 --> 26:30.458
blocked by the nebula, Reittan.

26:30.458 --> 26:32.333
Is there a problem?

26:32.333 --> 26:34.166
I'm afraid so, Captain.

26:34.166 --> 26:37.208
Lwaxana, Deanna,

26:34.166 --> 26:37.208
and Commander Riker

26:37.208 --> 26:38.959
have disappeared.

26:45.041 --> 26:48.417
I knew I wanted you

26:45.041 --> 26:48.417
the moment I saw you.

26:48.417 --> 26:51.458
You have fulfilled

26:48.417 --> 26:51.458
all of my expectations.

26:51.458 --> 26:52.709
How sweet.

26:52.709 --> 26:55.542
Farek thought

26:52.709 --> 26:55.542
it was a bad idea,

26:55.542 --> 26:56.959
but I knew better.

26:56.959 --> 26:58.208
How clever.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.792
I knew best.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.709
I always know best.

27:01.709 --> 27:03.834
(<i> low voice</i> ):

27:01.709 --> 27:03.834
How repugnant.

27:03.834 --> 27:04.959
What?

27:04.959 --> 27:06.333
Oh, I said, "How romantic."

27:06.333 --> 27:08.125
I can't

27:06.333 --> 27:08.125
resist a man

27:08.125 --> 27:11.959
who knows what he wants

27:08.125 --> 27:11.959
and goes after it.

27:11.959 --> 27:15.750
That's me and that's why

27:11.959 --> 27:15.750
I am DaiMon of this ship.

27:15.750 --> 27:18.291
I take charge

27:15.750 --> 27:18.291
in every situation.

27:18.291 --> 27:20.959
More to the left, woman.

27:20.959 --> 27:23.542
Whatever you say.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.792
(<i> moaning happily</i> )

27:26.792 --> 27:30.458
My darling, would you care

27:26.792 --> 27:30.458
for something to drink?

27:30.458 --> 27:32.583
Mmm. You're so attentive.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.542
Does your food

27:32.583 --> 27:34.542
synthesizer

27:34.542 --> 27:37.417
know how to make

27:34.542 --> 27:37.417
an Arcturian Fizz?

27:37.417 --> 27:39.125
I don't think so.

27:39.125 --> 27:42.709
They have certain

27:39.125 --> 27:42.709
pleasure-enhancing qualities.

27:42.709 --> 27:44.291
Hmm.

27:44.291 --> 27:47.917
Uh... let me teach

27:44.291 --> 27:47.917
your computer

27:44.291 --> 27:47.917
how to make one.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.959
Oh!

27:52.959 --> 27:55.834
I'll need your access code.

27:55.834 --> 27:57.875
Yes, my beloved.

27:57.875 --> 28:01.333
Computer, access code<i> Keh-ee</i>

28:01.333 --> 28:03.542
<i>Yoor-ee Dah-teh-ee...</i>

28:03.542 --> 28:05.250
Tog, be silent!

28:06.959 --> 28:10.041
I knew you were

28:06.959 --> 28:10.041
not to be trusted.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.917
Doctor Farek, I was

28:10.041 --> 28:12.917
just going to make

28:10.041 --> 28:12.917
DaiMon Tog a drink.

28:12.917 --> 28:16.208
Save your lies

28:12.917 --> 28:16.208
for this fool.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.542
B-But he's...

28:17.542 --> 28:18.834
But, oh, please,

28:17.542 --> 28:18.834
don't listen to him, don't.

28:18.834 --> 28:19.834
No, he's misunderstood.

28:19.834 --> 28:20.834
No, Tog.

28:20.834 --> 28:22.250
<i>You</i> have

28:20.834 --> 28:22.250
misunderstood.

28:22.250 --> 28:25.083
You have been tricked

28:22.250 --> 28:25.083
by a sly female

28:25.083 --> 28:26.875
who finds you repulsive.

28:26.875 --> 28:30.750
She was only trying

28:26.875 --> 28:30.750
to serve me a drink.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.041
You almost gave her

28:32.041 --> 28:34.000
complete access

28:32.041 --> 28:34.000
to the ship's computer--

28:34.000 --> 28:36.750
a security breach

28:34.000 --> 28:36.750
severe enough

28:36.750 --> 28:38.709
to cost you

28:36.750 --> 28:38.709
your command.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.208
It's time you took my advice.

28:42.208 --> 28:44.291
Let me study her.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.291
Study her?

28:46.291 --> 28:49.542
Your mind probes

28:46.291 --> 28:49.542
could kill her.

28:49.542 --> 28:52.709
You brought her aboard

28:49.542 --> 28:52.709
for her telepathic powers.

28:52.709 --> 28:54.250
If I can determine

28:54.250 --> 28:57.250
what neural configuration

28:54.250 --> 28:57.250
gives her those powers,

28:57.250 --> 29:00.125
I may be able

28:57.250 --> 29:00.125
to duplicate them.

29:00.125 --> 29:03.000
We could still profit from this.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.667
I don't know.

29:04.667 --> 29:08.500
A true DaiMon would not

29:04.667 --> 29:08.500
be blinded by lust.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.667
Give her to me

29:10.667 --> 29:14.125
or I may be forced

29:10.667 --> 29:14.125
to report your transgressions.

29:16.291 --> 29:17.291
Very well.

29:17.291 --> 29:18.709
Oh...

29:17.291 --> 29:18.709
Take her.

29:32.667 --> 29:35.625
WORF:

29:32.667 --> 29:35.625
When you're finished here,

29:32.667 --> 29:35.625
survey in that direction.

29:35.625 --> 29:36.834
Aye, sir.

29:41.083 --> 29:45.083
I wish I had some answers

29:41.083 --> 29:45.083
for you, Lieutenant Worf.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.667
Mr. Homn was no help?

29:46.667 --> 29:47.834
None. He last saw them

29:47.834 --> 29:49.333
as he was leaving

29:47.834 --> 29:49.333
this clearing.

29:49.333 --> 29:51.291
When he returned, all

29:49.333 --> 29:51.291
three of them were gone.

29:51.291 --> 29:53.917
Lieutenant Foley discovered this

29:51.291 --> 29:53.917
in the pond.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.625
The species is Zan Periculi.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.834
It is not indigenous to Betazed

29:58.834 --> 30:01.375
but to Lappa IV,

29:58.834 --> 30:01.375
a Ferengi world.

30:07.250 --> 30:10.417
Now we have a reasonable

30:07.250 --> 30:10.417
hypothesis as to whom.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.417
The difficult

30:10.417 --> 30:12.417
question is where.

30:12.417 --> 30:14.709
The Ferengi ship is almost

30:12.417 --> 30:14.709
as fast as the<i> Enterprise.</i>

30:14.709 --> 30:16.458
She could be anywhere by now.

30:16.458 --> 30:18.792
Commander Riker will assume

30:16.458 --> 30:18.792
we'll be searching for them.

30:18.792 --> 30:20.500
He'll find some way

30:18.792 --> 30:20.500
to send us a message.

30:20.500 --> 30:21.542
Mr. Worf,

30:21.542 --> 30:22.709
I want continual

30:21.542 --> 30:22.709
monitoring

30:22.709 --> 30:24.709
of Ferengi

30:22.709 --> 30:24.709
subspace frequencies.

30:24.709 --> 30:26.250
Mr. La Forge, can you extend

30:26.250 --> 30:27.875
our sensor range?

30:27.875 --> 30:29.458
If I narrow the band and tie in

30:27.875 --> 30:29.458
the long-range sensors

30:29.458 --> 30:31.542
to the subspace scanners,

30:29.458 --> 30:31.542
I can boost the gain.

30:31.542 --> 30:32.917
Make it so.

30:36.583 --> 30:38.291
Do you wish to leave orbit, sir?

30:38.291 --> 30:40.917
Not until we have

30:38.291 --> 30:40.917
some place to go.

30:47.625 --> 30:49.125
(<i> sighs</i> )

30:49.125 --> 30:51.542
I've done everything I know how.

30:49.125 --> 30:51.542
It's no use.

30:51.542 --> 30:53.000
Without Tog's security code,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.250
I can't get near

30:53.000 --> 30:55.250
their communication system.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.917
We're running

30:55.250 --> 30:56.917
out of time.

30:56.917 --> 30:59.875
Farek's about to begin

30:56.917 --> 30:59.875
the neural scan on Mother.

30:59.875 --> 31:02.667
Maybe I'm going about this

30:59.875 --> 31:02.667
in the wrong way.

31:02.667 --> 31:07.041
If I pick a minor subsystem,

31:02.667 --> 31:07.041
something non-essential...

31:09.417 --> 31:11.542
Like this-- warp field

31:09.417 --> 31:11.542
phase adjustment.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.959
All this does is suppress

31:11.542 --> 31:13.959
the subspace interference

31:13.959 --> 31:15.375
generated

31:13.959 --> 31:15.375
by the warp engines.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.750
Meaning what?

31:16.750 --> 31:18.750
Meaning, if I set up

31:16.750 --> 31:18.750
a simple oscillation,

31:18.750 --> 31:20.000
I can send out a signal.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.583
The trick is

31:20.000 --> 31:21.583
to create a message

31:21.583 --> 31:23.291
the<i> Enterprise</i> will understand

31:23.291 --> 31:25.834
but the Ferengi will think is

31:23.291 --> 31:25.834
just normal subspace static.

31:26.959 --> 31:28.417
(<i> electronic zapping</i> )

31:28.417 --> 31:30.792
(<i> Lwaxana groaning</i> )

31:30.792 --> 31:32.667
(<i> Lwaxana yells</i> )

31:34.458 --> 31:36.542
Oh...

31:36.542 --> 31:38.375
What's wrong?

31:38.375 --> 31:40.458
Mother.

31:44.041 --> 31:47.542
Will... we have to help her.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.291
Thanks for your help, Wes,

32:01.291 --> 32:02.709
but you'd better get

32:01.291 --> 32:02.709
aboard the<i> Bradbury.</i>

32:02.709 --> 32:04.625
They were ready to break

32:02.709 --> 32:04.625
orbit an hour ago.

32:04.625 --> 32:06.291
As soon as I'm sure

32:04.625 --> 32:06.291
this works.

32:10.959 --> 32:12.458
Initiating scans now, Captain.

32:12.458 --> 32:17.625
(<i> static hissing and beeping)</i>

32:17.625 --> 32:19.750
Can you locate the<i> Krayton?</i>

32:19.750 --> 32:21.125
Ferengi transmissions

32:21.125 --> 32:23.834
are routinely scrambled

32:21.125 --> 32:23.834
and encoded, sir.

32:23.834 --> 32:25.875
Without breaking the

32:23.834 --> 32:25.875
code, we will be unable

32:25.875 --> 32:27.959
to identify

32:25.875 --> 32:27.959
any specific

32:25.875 --> 32:27.959
Ferengi vessel.

32:27.959 --> 32:30.834
Ferengi codes are damn near

32:27.959 --> 32:30.834
impossible to break.

32:30.834 --> 32:32.709
Gentlemen, I have

32:30.834 --> 32:32.709
the utmost confidence

32:32.709 --> 32:34.959
in your ability to

32:32.709 --> 32:34.959
perform the impossible.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.959
(<i> static popping and beeping)</i>

32:42.667 --> 32:44.417
Captain, the<i> Bradbury</i>

32:42.667 --> 32:44.417
is hailing us.

32:44.417 --> 32:46.458
They can no longer delay

32:44.417 --> 32:46.458
their departure.

32:46.458 --> 32:47.667
Mr. Crusher,

32:47.667 --> 32:49.250
now.

32:49.250 --> 32:50.834
No lengthy farewells.

32:50.834 --> 32:52.166
Good luck.

32:52.166 --> 32:54.333
Thank you, sir.

33:01.375 --> 33:04.834
DATA:

33:01.375 --> 33:04.834
The repetitive nature

33:01.375 --> 33:04.834
of the subcarrier pattern

33:04.834 --> 33:07.875
implies a modified

33:04.834 --> 33:07.875
Huffman-Greenlaw encoder

33:04.834 --> 33:07.875
scheme...

33:07.875 --> 33:10.625
Deck six.

33:13.291 --> 33:15.083
Wesley.

33:19.542 --> 33:21.166
Take care.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.625
You too, Mom.

33:25.750 --> 33:27.166
Something the matter?

33:27.166 --> 33:30.709
We've been scanning

33:27.166 --> 33:30.709
Ferengi transmissions

33:30.709 --> 33:33.500
trying to locate the<i> Krayton.</i>

33:33.500 --> 33:35.208
One of the signals was...

33:35.208 --> 33:37.542
I don't know, familiar somehow.

33:37.542 --> 33:38.834
Something in the message?

33:38.834 --> 33:42.000
No, the message was scrambled.

33:43.834 --> 33:45.834
It was the static!

33:45.834 --> 33:47.250
Where are you going?

33:47.250 --> 33:49.709
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

33:55.500 --> 33:57.583
Captain.

33:57.583 --> 33:59.583
The<i> Bradbury</i> has informed us

33:59.583 --> 34:03.333
they can no longer wait

33:59.583 --> 34:03.333
for Mr. Crusher to come aboard.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.542
Wesley.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.709
Captain, I think

34:04.542 --> 34:05.709
there's a pattern

34:05.709 --> 34:06.959
to the subspace

34:05.709 --> 34:06.959
interference

34:06.959 --> 34:08.291
I heard in one

34:06.959 --> 34:08.291
of the Ferengi messages.

34:08.291 --> 34:09.709
Wesley, unless you

34:08.291 --> 34:09.709
leave immediately,

34:09.709 --> 34:11.125
you're going to miss

34:09.709 --> 34:11.125
the<i> Bradbury.</i>

34:11.125 --> 34:12.709
The interference itself

34:11.125 --> 34:12.709
could be a message.

34:12.709 --> 34:15.458
If I could just hear a replay

34:12.709 --> 34:15.458
of the subspace scans.

34:17.125 --> 34:19.250
Signal the<i> Bradbury</i>

34:17.125 --> 34:19.250
they may leave.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.500
Play back

34:19.250 --> 34:21.500
the Ferengi transmissions.

34:21.500 --> 34:26.000
(<i> static hissing and popping)</i>

34:26.000 --> 34:27.750
Wait, repeat that one.

34:27.750 --> 34:30.667
Put it on continuous replay.

34:30.667 --> 34:33.792
Hear that popping noise?

34:33.792 --> 34:36.375
Data, can you filter out

34:33.792 --> 34:36.375
everything but that sound?

34:36.375 --> 34:38.291
(<i> popping, rhythmic beeps</i> )

34:38.291 --> 34:40.208
That's Cochrane distortion--

34:40.208 --> 34:42.208
a fluctuation in the phase

34:40.208 --> 34:42.208
of the subspace field.

34:42.208 --> 34:44.959
All warp engines generate

34:42.208 --> 34:44.959
that kind of interference.

34:44.959 --> 34:46.834
But listen to the pattern.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.750
It's the Algolian

34:48.750 --> 34:50.750
ceremonial rhythm

34:50.750 --> 34:53.041
that the musician played

34:50.750 --> 34:53.041
at the reception.

34:53.041 --> 34:54.667
Mr. Crusher

34:53.041 --> 34:54.667
is correct, sir.

34:54.667 --> 34:56.417
There is a temporal

34:54.667 --> 34:56.417
correlation.

34:56.417 --> 34:58.625
Then it is a signal

34:56.417 --> 34:58.625
from Commander Riker.

34:58.625 --> 34:59.875
Ingenious.

34:59.875 --> 35:02.458
He selected a signal

34:59.875 --> 35:02.458
we'd recognize

35:02.458 --> 35:04.917
but one the Ferengi

35:02.458 --> 35:04.917
would dismiss as static.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.542
(<i> console beeping</i> )

35:09.542 --> 35:10.917
WORF:

35:09.542 --> 35:10.917
Signal source located, Captain.

35:10.917 --> 35:12.500
Plot an intercept course.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.667
Course plotted and laid in,

35:12.500 --> 35:14.667
sir.

35:14.667 --> 35:15.709
Well done, Mr. Crusher.

35:15.709 --> 35:16.709
Warp eight.

35:16.709 --> 35:17.959
Aye, sir.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.291
Engage.

35:21.208 --> 35:24.041
(<i> groaning loudly</i> )

35:24.041 --> 35:25.291
Get away from her.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.709
What do you think

35:25.291 --> 35:26.709
you're doing?

35:29.959 --> 35:31.875
Standoff, Commander.

35:37.125 --> 35:40.709
DaiMon Tog, can't we

35:37.125 --> 35:40.709
strike a bargain?

35:40.709 --> 35:43.291
All I am concerned about

35:43.291 --> 35:44.750
is my daughter's safety.

35:44.750 --> 35:46.917
What happens to me

35:44.750 --> 35:46.917
isn't important.

35:46.917 --> 35:48.792
What are you suggesting?

35:48.792 --> 35:51.417
Well, let me be candid,

35:48.792 --> 35:51.417
DaiMon Tog.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.583
Deanna's of no use to you.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.125
She's only

35:52.583 --> 35:54.125
half Betazoid.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.542
And if you keep Riker,

35:55.542 --> 35:57.875
Starfleet will never stop

35:55.542 --> 35:57.875
chasing you.

35:57.875 --> 35:59.875
Release them.

35:59.875 --> 36:03.417
Release them and I will stay

35:59.875 --> 36:03.417
with you willingly.

36:03.417 --> 36:05.083
I'll even use

36:03.417 --> 36:05.083
my telepathy

36:05.083 --> 36:07.959
to aid in your negotiations.

36:07.959 --> 36:09.542
A tempting offer.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.166
I would like to believe you.

36:12.166 --> 36:14.625
The offer is genuine.

36:14.625 --> 36:18.709
I give you my word as a daughter

36:14.625 --> 36:18.709
of the Fifth House of Betazed.

36:18.709 --> 36:19.917
Lwaxana, don't.

36:19.917 --> 36:21.250
I've made up my mind.

36:21.250 --> 36:22.583
I can't let you do this.

36:22.583 --> 36:24.125
William, I am a grown woman.

36:24.125 --> 36:25.875
I can make my own decisions.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.125
Mother, we can't

36:25.875 --> 36:28.125
just leave you here.

36:28.125 --> 36:29.458
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

36:29.458 --> 36:32.333
<i>And before he</i>

36:29.458 --> 36:32.333
<i>changes his mind.</i>

36:32.333 --> 36:36.333
Please, Little One,

36:32.333 --> 36:36.333
do this for me.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.667
Just this once.

36:45.875 --> 36:47.542
Do we have an agreement?

36:54.417 --> 36:56.583
I give you my word.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.667
I will release your daughter

36:58.500 --> 37:01.667
and the Commander.

37:01.667 --> 37:04.625
CREWMAN:

37:01.667 --> 37:04.625
DaiMon, a Federation ship

37:01.667 --> 37:04.625
approaching at high warp.

37:04.625 --> 37:06.625
The<i> Enterprise</i> has found us.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.834
Slow to impulse.

37:08.834 --> 37:10.792
Raise shields.

37:10.792 --> 37:14.000
Inform the<i> Enterprise</i>

37:10.792 --> 37:14.000
that two of our guests

37:14.000 --> 37:15.500
are ready to return.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
The other will be

37:15.500 --> 37:17.500
staying with us

37:17.500 --> 37:19.166
at her own request.

37:19.166 --> 37:21.166
I must protest, DaiMon.

37:21.166 --> 37:23.583
Lwaxana has given her word.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.709
<i>Oo-mox</i> is only the beginning.

37:58.291 --> 37:59.834
Are you both all right?

37:59.834 --> 38:01.667
None the worse for wear.

38:01.667 --> 38:03.667
My mother bought

38:01.667 --> 38:03.667
our freedom, Captain.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.667
She doesn't want

38:03.667 --> 38:05.667
to stay with Tog.

38:07.667 --> 38:09.041
Hail the<i> Krayton.</i>

38:09.041 --> 38:13.875
Frequencies open.

38:09.041 --> 38:13.875
DaiMon Tog responding.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.458
On screen.

38:15.458 --> 38:19.166
Captain Picard, so good of you

38:15.458 --> 38:19.166
to meet us.

38:19.166 --> 38:23.917
We were on our way to Betazed

38:19.166 --> 38:23.917
to return our guests.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.834
Of course you were, DaiMon.

38:25.834 --> 38:28.542
But you're still holding

38:25.834 --> 38:28.542
Lwaxana Troi.

38:30.667 --> 38:32.792
When will you get it

38:30.667 --> 38:32.792
through your thick head

38:32.792 --> 38:34.959
that it's over

38:32.792 --> 38:34.959
between us, Jean-Luc?

38:37.375 --> 38:40.250
I think I know

38:37.375 --> 38:40.250
what she's doing.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.458
You have to fight

38:41.458 --> 38:43.625
to get her

38:41.458 --> 38:43.625
back, Captain.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.625
Open.

38:52.792 --> 38:56.583
Um, uh, uh... it's not over

38:52.792 --> 38:56.583
between us, Lwaxana.

38:56.583 --> 38:59.083
Um, uh...

38:56.583 --> 38:59.083
you're mine and, um...

38:59.083 --> 39:00.750
I-I will not let you go.

39:00.750 --> 39:03.375
I-I insist you

39:00.750 --> 39:03.375
return to my side

39:03.375 --> 39:04.458
immediately.

39:04.458 --> 39:06.166
You mean, you

39:04.458 --> 39:06.166
still care?

39:09.667 --> 39:15.458
"My love is a fever,

39:09.667 --> 39:15.458
longing still for that

39:15.458 --> 39:18.166
which longer nurseth

39:15.458 --> 39:18.166
the disease."

39:18.166 --> 39:19.667
Tell me more.

39:19.667 --> 39:24.667
"In faith, I do not love thee

39:19.667 --> 39:24.667
with mine eyes,

39:24.667 --> 39:28.041
"for they in thee

39:24.667 --> 39:28.041
a thousand errors see,

39:28.041 --> 39:33.166
"But 'tis my heart

39:28.041 --> 39:33.166
that loves what they despise,

39:33.166 --> 39:36.667
"Who, in despite of view,

39:33.166 --> 39:36.667
art pleas'd to dote.

39:36.667 --> 39:40.333
"Shall I compare thee

39:36.667 --> 39:40.333
to a summer's day?

39:40.333 --> 39:42.583
Thou art more lovely

39:40.333 --> 39:42.583
and more temperate..."

39:42.583 --> 39:46.000
You didn't tell me that you

39:42.583 --> 39:46.000
and Captain Picard were...

39:46.000 --> 39:49.709
You said you didn't

39:46.000 --> 39:49.709
want to hear about

39:46.000 --> 39:49.709
my other romances.

39:49.709 --> 39:51.792
I have a new love, Jean-Luc.

39:51.792 --> 39:53.208
And you can't

39:53.208 --> 39:54.542
keep killing all my lovers.

39:54.542 --> 39:55.750
Now, that simply has to stop.

39:55.750 --> 39:57.375
Killing?

39:57.375 --> 39:58.834
Oh, he's insanely jealous.

39:58.834 --> 40:00.709
Listen, Tog,

39:58.834 --> 40:00.709
I must possess Lwaxana,

40:00.709 --> 40:03.709
and if that means destroying

40:00.709 --> 40:03.709
your ship in the process,

40:03.709 --> 40:04.959
so be it.

40:04.959 --> 40:07.834
Captain, I had

40:04.959 --> 40:07.834
no idea Lwaxa...

40:07.834 --> 40:09.917
Don't let him

40:07.834 --> 40:09.917
threaten you.

40:09.917 --> 40:11.458
You can defeat him.

40:11.458 --> 40:14.250
The only way you'll

40:11.458 --> 40:14.250
ever get me back

40:14.250 --> 40:16.250
is over Tog's dead body.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.875
That can be arranged.

40:17.875 --> 40:21.041
Mr. Worf, arm phaser banks

40:17.875 --> 40:21.041
and photon torpedoes.

40:21.041 --> 40:24.458
If Lwaxana Troi is not

40:21.041 --> 40:24.458
in my arms in ten seconds,

40:24.458 --> 40:27.542
throw everything you've got

40:24.458 --> 40:27.542
at the<i> Krayton.</i>

40:27.542 --> 40:29.750
But you will destroy Lwaxana.

40:29.750 --> 40:32.208
"When I have pluck'd the rose,

40:32.208 --> 40:35.583
"I cannot give it

40:32.208 --> 40:35.583
vital growth again.

40:35.583 --> 40:37.625
It needs must wither."

40:37.625 --> 40:39.875
Nine, eight...

40:39.875 --> 40:43.000
"'Tis better to have loved

40:39.875 --> 40:43.000
and lost

40:43.000 --> 40:46.250
than never to have loved

40:43.000 --> 40:46.250
at all."

40:46.250 --> 40:48.208
Seven... six...

40:48.208 --> 40:49.417
No, wait.

40:49.417 --> 40:51.375
Five... four...

40:51.375 --> 40:53.500
Beam her to their Bridge now.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.417
Two... one...

41:04.667 --> 41:08.250
You wonderfully

41:04.667 --> 41:08.250
jealous fool, you.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.000
TOG:

41:08.250 --> 41:10.000
Captain...

41:10.000 --> 41:12.166
I-I trust there will be

41:10.000 --> 41:12.166
no further action

41:12.166 --> 41:13.792
taken against us?

41:13.792 --> 41:16.041
Such as my reporting this

41:13.792 --> 41:16.041
incident to your superiors

41:16.041 --> 41:17.959
who may question

41:16.041 --> 41:17.959
your competence as DaiMon?

41:17.959 --> 41:19.083
I will think about it.

41:19.083 --> 41:20.542
Screen off.

41:21.959 --> 41:23.792
Thank you, Jean-Luc.

41:23.792 --> 41:26.041
You were most convincing.

41:26.041 --> 41:28.333
You certainly

41:26.041 --> 41:28.333
convinced me.

41:28.333 --> 41:30.500
I am truly grateful,

41:28.333 --> 41:30.500
Mrs. Troi,

41:30.500 --> 41:33.542
that you risked your life

41:30.500 --> 41:33.542
to save my people.

41:33.542 --> 41:35.417
I'll have you home

41:33.542 --> 41:35.417
in a few hours.

41:35.417 --> 41:36.500
Oh, no, no, no, no.

41:36.500 --> 41:37.625
That won't be necessary.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.041
I'd just love

41:37.625 --> 41:39.041
to hear more

41:39.041 --> 41:40.375
of your poetry.

41:40.375 --> 41:41.458
Ah...

41:41.458 --> 41:42.959
Perhaps another time.

41:44.667 --> 41:46.000
Please.

41:48.083 --> 41:49.834
Mr. Crusher.

41:49.834 --> 41:51.542
Set course for Betazed.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.417
(<i> quietly</i> ):

41:51.542 --> 41:53.417
Warp nine.

42:01.417 --> 42:03.166
(<i> door chimes</i> )

42:01.417 --> 42:03.166
Come.

42:06.375 --> 42:08.000
You wanted to see me, Captain?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.542
I've been in touch with Admiral

42:08.000 --> 42:10.542
Hahn at Starfleet Academy.

42:10.542 --> 42:12.500
He regrets your missing

42:10.542 --> 42:12.500
the oral examination

42:12.500 --> 42:14.917
but hopes that you will

42:12.500 --> 42:14.917
reapply next year.

42:14.917 --> 42:16.834
I understand, sir.

42:16.834 --> 42:19.542
And I do intend to reapply.

42:19.542 --> 42:22.750
In the interim,

42:19.542 --> 42:22.750
the Academy's loss is our gain.

42:22.750 --> 42:24.083
The<i> Enterprise</i>

42:24.083 --> 42:25.291
will continue to benefit

42:25.291 --> 42:26.709
from your talents

42:25.291 --> 42:26.709
for another year.

42:26.709 --> 42:28.041
Thank you, sir.

42:28.041 --> 42:31.375
(<i> inhales deeply</i> )

42:32.959 --> 42:34.625
Is that all?

42:35.959 --> 42:37.500
No.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.041
Is there something wrong,

42:37.500 --> 42:40.041
Captain?

42:40.041 --> 42:42.792
I'm just thinking that...

42:42.792 --> 42:48.208
I'm saying good-bye to you

42:42.792 --> 42:48.208
as you are today.

42:48.208 --> 42:51.250
But I thought you said I

42:48.208 --> 42:51.250
wasn't going to be able to go.

42:51.250 --> 42:54.792
The Academy must make you wait,

42:51.250 --> 42:54.792
that's true.

42:54.792 --> 42:59.667
But when I review your service

42:54.792 --> 42:59.667
to this ship, your crew mates,

42:59.667 --> 43:01.875
I cannot in all conscience

43:01.875 --> 43:04.792
make you wait

43:01.875 --> 43:04.792
for the Academy.

43:04.792 --> 43:07.208
You see, Wesley...

43:07.208 --> 43:13.083
in my eyes, you're an

43:07.208 --> 43:13.083
acting Ensign in title only.

43:13.083 --> 43:17.750
I hereby grant you

43:13.083 --> 43:17.750
field promotion to full Ensign

43:17.750 --> 43:20.125
with all the commensurate

43:17.750 --> 43:20.125
responsibilities

43:20.125 --> 43:22.166
and privileges

43:20.125 --> 43:22.166
of that rank.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.458
Congratulations.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.792
You're dismissed.

43:41.458 --> 43:45.166
Lwaxana Troi has beamed down

43:41.458 --> 43:45.166
to Betazed, Captain.

43:45.166 --> 43:48.125
Notify Starfleet we are en route

43:45.166 --> 43:48.125
to the Xanthras system

43:48.125 --> 43:50.417
for our rendezvous

43:48.125 --> 43:50.417
with the<i> Zapata.</i>

43:50.417 --> 43:51.667
Aye, sir.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.750
Ensign Crusher,

44:10.083 --> 44:12.750
take us out of orbit.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.166
Set a course for Xanthras III.

44:15.166 --> 44:16.750
Warp factor six.

44:16.750 --> 44:18.750
Aye, sir.

44:18.750 --> 44:20.709
Course is set.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.333
Engage.
