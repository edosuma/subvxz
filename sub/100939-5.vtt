00:19.410 --> 00:21.369
â™ª

00:32.989 --> 00:34.599
One, two, three, four.

00:38.299 --> 00:40.257
â™ª

00:50.528 --> 00:52.463
No one goes to Afghanistan
thinking it's gonna be pretty.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.141
I understood.

00:54.184 --> 00:57.100
Everybody in the unit understoodthat
people were gonna die.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.122
- But what he did...
- By "he,"
you mean the defendant?

00:59.146 --> 01:01.061
Yes, Sergeant Meyer.
What he did wasn't about

01:01.104 --> 01:04.020
fighting the enemy.
For him, it was a game.

01:04.064 --> 01:07.110
He picked off this one old
womanwith a sniper rifle.

01:07.154 --> 01:09.025
She wasn't a threat,
she was just...

01:12.246 --> 01:13.638
She was just walking.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.466
The body was still lying there
an hour later

01:15.510 --> 01:16.728
when we passed in a convoy.

01:16.772 --> 01:18.034
And the sergeant had us stop

01:18.078 --> 01:19.558
so he could yank out
one of her teeth.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.255
- Her teeth?
- The sergeant must have

01:21.298 --> 01:22.995
seen my look, because he said,

01:23.039 --> 01:25.085
"It's like antlers from a deer.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.695
You can't go thinking
they're human."

01:26.738 --> 01:31.091
Later, I found out he had a...
a mason jar full of teeth.

01:33.571 --> 01:36.096
Did you witness him
murder a child?

01:37.184 --> 01:40.274
A ten-year-old boy.

01:40.317 --> 01:41.666
Ghulam Dawood.

01:43.668 --> 01:46.018
I knew the kid a little.

01:46.062 --> 01:49.544
He came up to me once with
a picture of LeBron James.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.286
Big smile on his face.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.722
That boy was no jihadi.

01:53.765 --> 01:56.028
Once you were convinced
Sergeant Meyer

01:56.072 --> 01:57.682
went on a rogue killing spree,

01:57.726 --> 02:00.032
- did you take action
to stop him?
- I did.

02:00.076 --> 02:02.600
I fixed his sniper rifle
so he couldn't get off a shot.

02:02.644 --> 02:05.037
And when that didn't work,
we went to the platoon leader.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.823
We trusted the chain of command.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.523
- How's it been?
- You know what it's like

02:12.567 --> 02:14.046
to testify against
your superiors.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.439
Some hate you, most ignore you,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.137
- a few get it.
- In what proportions?

02:17.180 --> 02:18.268
A lot more hate.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.404
What's that about?

02:23.447 --> 02:27.059
Hey, De', you know, you said
you fixed Meyer's rifle.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.646
How'd you do that?-LANEY:
I hacked his scope. Why?

02:28.670 --> 02:30.715
- Oh, shit. You don't think...
- Don't say anything.

02:30.759 --> 02:31.910
If it's about you,
don't say anything.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.544
- Oh, fuck.
- No, Demarcus, listen to me.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.218
Ask for Captain Trudo.
He's thebest of the military lawyers.

02:35.242 --> 02:36.741
- Corporal Demarcus Laney,
you're under arrest.
- Mention me.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.743
- What did I do? What? What?
- Hey, Lan-Laney. Shut up.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.117
And remember,
ask for Captain Trudo.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.393
- Do you need something?
- Oh, no.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.352
No, it's just hard
to get used to this.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.832
A limo driving me up
to a private jet.

03:00.876 --> 03:03.792
Do it enough times,
you get used to it.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.273
What are enough times?

03:06.316 --> 03:07.796
Five.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.412
- I got it.
- Oh, no. My parents

03:15.456 --> 03:16.781
always taught me
to carry my own luggage.

03:16.805 --> 03:19.111
So did mine, and I'm being paid.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.157
Thank you.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.726
- Hi.
- You got babysitting?

03:24.769 --> 03:26.293
- I did.
- And you brought a swimsuit?

03:26.336 --> 03:27.468
I... No.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.383
- I'm going to work, right?
- Uh,

03:29.426 --> 03:32.386
yeah, but, uh, you know,
it's by the beach.

03:32.429 --> 03:33.648
I have extra.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.476
- Come on.
- Hey, what's wrong?

03:35.519 --> 03:37.149
Oh, nothing.
I just broke up with somebody.

03:37.173 --> 03:39.219
- What, just now?
- Don't worry.

03:39.262 --> 03:40.916
He was an asshole.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.616
And then

03:45.660 --> 03:48.576
- he asked if I would look over
his business plan.
- Oh, God.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.795
It's a version of Bird

03:50.839 --> 03:53.363
but with Segways instead.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.497
He only needs a few mil
to get started.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.150
I'm so sorry.

03:58.194 --> 04:02.198
Three dates,
and they always want something.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.896
What about you?

04:04.940 --> 04:06.550
Do I want something?

04:06.594 --> 04:08.465
No. Do you get the same thing?

04:08.509 --> 04:10.250
Do men want me for my money?

04:10.293 --> 04:11.816
Oh, yeah, all the time.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.383
It's a burden.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.690
No, really.
What's going on with you?

04:15.733 --> 04:18.170
Nothing.
I'm not that interesting.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.824
Fuck you.
I'm always the one talking.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.262
- You never share.
- There's nothing to share.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.265
I have a toddler.
I'm trying to make partner.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.484
Have you heard
of the lawyer's dilemma?

04:27.528 --> 04:29.704
Work, family,

04:29.747 --> 04:31.836
fitness, friends, sleep.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.621
You get to choose three
of those.

04:33.664 --> 04:36.841
- Which are yours?
- Work, family, sleep.

04:36.885 --> 04:40.236
Trade sleep for friends,
and we have a deal.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.850
Oh, shit, I left my phone on.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.330
Lucca.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.550
It's my plane.
You can have it on.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.598
Marissa, hey.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.793
- What's up?
- Diane wants you

04:55.817 --> 04:57.273
in the partner meeting
in five minutes.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.777
What? N-No, I'm...
Marissa, I'm...

04:59.821 --> 05:01.301
I'm joking.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.911
Don't do that.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.869
-So, what's it like?
Is there a hot tub?
-No.

05:04.913 --> 05:05.977
You're kidding.
Why have a private jet

05:06.001 --> 05:07.219
if you don't have a hot tub?

05:07.263 --> 05:08.612
Since when?

05:08.656 --> 05:10.397
So, you'll check in

05:10.440 --> 05:11.702
on Francesca for me?

05:11.746 --> 05:13.182
This is the longest

05:13.225 --> 05:14.551
- that she's looked
after Joseph.
- Got it.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.228
She's not gonna replace me
as a friend?

05:16.272 --> 05:17.839
- Francesca?
- No, your rich friend.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.363
- Just remember, I'm funnier.
- Oh, yeah.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.540
I'll remember when I'm sitting
in a hammock on the beach.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.934
- See you in a few days.
- Buy me something.

05:25.977 --> 05:28.632
I'm on my way there right now.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.950
I need a month off.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.560
No.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.954
- Then this is my notice.
- Wait.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.916
You're my eyes and ears
down there.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.790
I know. And I need a month off
to defend someone.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.792
- Who?
- Someone I owe my life to.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.663
Who?

05:59.707 --> 06:01.012
An Army corporal.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.493
He's been charged
with insubordination,

06:03.537 --> 06:06.366
- sabotage
and negligent homicide.
- All right.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.431
- So he has a military lawyer.
- Yeah, and they replaced him

06:08.455 --> 06:09.717
with a bad one.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.414
- He's going to court tomorrow.
- Okay.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.763
Wait.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.465
- Come with me.
- Where?

06:18.508 --> 06:20.292
Don't be so suspicious.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.859
Just come with me.

06:36.352 --> 06:37.788
Uh, wait.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.573
- Uh...
- What? You're not

06:39.616 --> 06:41.357
doing this alone.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.711
- Mr. Firth.
- Liz.

06:47.755 --> 06:49.713
- Where's Adrian?
- Uh, New York.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.455
- At a legal conference.
- Oh. You two

06:52.499 --> 06:54.326
- know each other?
- Uh...

06:54.370 --> 06:55.632
- Not so much.
- Ye...

06:55.676 --> 06:56.696
- But to a certain degree.
- But we did the...

06:56.720 --> 06:57.852
- the one case.
- Sure.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.332
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:00.376 --> 07:04.336
So, I need you to help Caleb
with a case in military court

07:04.380 --> 07:05.816
as a personal favor.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.838
I'd like Caleb to stay
involvedwith things down here.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.341
- Okay?
- Sure.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.647
Thanks.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.913
- I didn't ask...
- I know.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.654
- And you don't have to...
- No, it's...

07:17.698 --> 07:18.873
It's my job.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.618
Listen, um...

07:26.489 --> 07:28.448
I just want you to know

07:28.491 --> 07:31.494
that I've never done
anything like that before.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.931
Me, neither.
Wait, what are we talking about?

07:33.975 --> 07:35.977
Going off together.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.068
Um, I-I haven't been with
anyonesince my divorce.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.549
It was just experimentation.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.593
- Right?
- Right.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.117
And we move on.

07:46.161 --> 07:48.859
Exactly. Moving on.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.779
So, uh, what's the case?

07:55.823 --> 07:57.520
Corporal Demarcus Laney.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.480
He's a friend I served with
in the Baghlan Province.

08:00.523 --> 08:03.047
-How long were you in the Army?-Five years.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.701
You don't seem like the type.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.660
- What's the type?
- I don't know.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.009
J-Just not you.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.098
Where is Baghlan Province?

08:10.141 --> 08:11.621
Afghanistan.

08:11.665 --> 08:14.058
Laney testified
against a superior

08:14.102 --> 08:16.626
and admittedhe'd sabotaged
his sniper rifle.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.716
Next day, his superior killed
an Afghan translator,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.501
and they're blaming
Laney's sabotage.

08:21.544 --> 08:22.850
Why'd he sabotage the gun?

08:22.893 --> 08:24.765
Because his superior
was committing war crimes.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.898
Laney wanted to keep the rifle
from firing.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.596
Okay, well, we'll...

08:29.639 --> 08:31.815
We'll get a quick continuance
to buy us some time.

08:31.859 --> 08:32.990
All rise.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.081
Okay.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.735
Where are we on this?

08:38.779 --> 08:40.234
Plaintiff is ready to proceed,
Your Honor.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.565
Defense asks the court
for a continuance of 60 days.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.587
Your Honor, that would be
their fourth continuance.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.458
I'm arguing an appeal
before the Seventh Circuit

08:46.482 --> 08:48.440
on Thursday. Can't be helped.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.747
Your Honor, the last
two continuances were granted

08:50.791 --> 08:53.576
because Mr. Jansen was going
out of town for depositions.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.056
Before that, he was on vacation.

08:55.099 --> 08:56.753
Even litigators need a holiday.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.450
This is a way
to starve our case.

08:58.494 --> 09:00.452
They are a deep pocket
who can outwait us.

09:00.496 --> 09:01.889
They'll get
constant continuances,

09:01.932 --> 09:03.586
and then afterwards,
they'll appeal.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.153
And then they'll appeal
those appeals,

09:05.196 --> 09:06.937
and not because they think
that they can win

09:06.981 --> 09:08.611
but because they know
we don't have the money

09:08.635 --> 09:10.158
to keep the case going.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.203
So we'll quit.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.209
60-day continuance granted.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.907
Marked final.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.648
All rise.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.529
My God.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.617
Look at yourself.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.619
Go away. You don't exist.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.926
You're damn right.
A conservative with principles?

09:38.969 --> 09:40.730
There don't seem to be any
of those around here.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.017
Well, it's very easy
for you to stay true

09:43.060 --> 09:44.821
to your principles. You don't
live in the real world.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.542
Go ahead. Make excuses

09:46.586 --> 09:47.954
- for what you've become.
- What's that?

09:47.978 --> 09:49.501
A bad judge.

09:49.545 --> 09:51.765
Someone slides a piece
of paperacross your desk

09:51.808 --> 09:54.637
with "Memo 618,"
and you fold like origami.

09:54.681 --> 09:55.943
Yeah, well...

09:56.987 --> 09:58.206
Attention!

10:02.689 --> 10:04.255
At ease.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.784
Sergeant.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.786
Corporal Laney, what was wrong

10:12.829 --> 10:14.309
with the attorney
assigned to you?

10:14.352 --> 10:16.243
-I prefer the ones
I have now, Your Honor.
-The Army

10:16.267 --> 10:17.660
doesn't pay
for civilian counsel.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.793
Our firm has taken the case
pro bono, Your Honor.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.396
He will not be charged
for our services.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.891
Military attorneys receive

10:30.934 --> 10:32.719
- specialized training.
- I've served

10:32.762 --> 10:34.721
in the Army, Your Honor.
Sergeant Garlin.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.287
You have legal training
in the Army?

10:37.332 --> 10:38.594
No, ma'am.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.813
We understand there are

10:39.856 --> 10:41.597
differences between civilian

10:41.641 --> 10:44.600
and military practice
and, uh, we move for

10:44.644 --> 10:46.709
a continuance to give us
time to familiarize ourselves

10:46.733 --> 10:48.212
with the case and the rules

10:48.256 --> 10:50.562
- of court-martial.
- Denied.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.628
Your Honor, we are only trying
to ensure a fair trial.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.132
So am I... justice delayed
is justice denied.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.699
Corporal Laney will not

10:56.743 --> 10:58.179
get extra time
just for rejecting

10:58.222 --> 10:59.876
the counsel provided to him.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.052
Opening statements begin
tomorrow at 0900 hours.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.098
Maybe we can get
a real chair by then.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.798
â™ª

11:40.874 --> 11:43.267
â™ª

12:10.033 --> 12:12.166
â™ª

12:27.964 --> 12:29.966
â™ª

12:49.290 --> 12:51.335
I'll get the exhibits ready.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.207
Okay. Jay!

12:53.250 --> 12:55.078
Hey.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.385
Listen, this is a list of men
who served in Afghanistan

12:57.428 --> 12:59.169
with a soldier
that we're defending.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.451
Can you see if they'll
testify for him?

13:00.475 --> 13:01.693
When do you need them?

13:01.737 --> 13:04.261
We're in court tomorrow,
so hurry.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.568
Okay.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.137
Your firm argue
in military court?

13:10.180 --> 13:12.443
Diane?

13:12.487 --> 13:15.272
That bird has been
staring at me.

13:15.316 --> 13:17.579
Okay.

13:17.622 --> 13:20.103
It's been there for ten minutes.

13:23.454 --> 13:25.630
Are you all right?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.284
Oh, yes, sorry.

13:27.328 --> 13:29.286
I just have nothing to do.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.177
Wait, I thought you were chasingall
those disappearing cases.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.855
The Memo 618?

13:32.899 --> 13:35.205
Yeah, well, I've moved on.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.467
Why?

13:36.511 --> 13:37.642
Threats.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.296
- We received threats.
- "We"?

13:39.340 --> 13:40.863
- Kurt and I.
- Well, it makes sense.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.734
Once swatted, twice shy.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.128
Listen, your old firm,

13:45.172 --> 13:46.738
did you argue in military court?

13:46.782 --> 13:49.611
Um, my partner did,
Will Gardner.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.526
Was he in front of Leora Kuhn?

13:51.569 --> 13:52.788
He was, yes.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.616
Okay, what do you know
about her?

13:54.659 --> 13:56.139
You know, I'll...

13:56.183 --> 13:57.247
- I'll come back.
- Uh, no, uh...

13:57.271 --> 13:58.838
Kuhn is tough.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.275
By the book, but fair.
Uh, Will ended up

14:01.318 --> 14:03.146
liking her.
She just needs you

14:03.190 --> 14:05.192
- to follow the rules
of evidence.
- Got it, thanks.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.432
Excuse me?

14:28.476 --> 14:31.218
Uh, yes?

14:32.959 --> 14:35.265
â™ª

14:35.309 --> 14:36.876
Uh, how do I know you?

14:36.919 --> 14:38.312
I don't know.

14:38.355 --> 14:39.704
Who are you?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.489
Diane Lockhart.

14:41.532 --> 14:42.838
Oh! Oh, you're Diane.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.187
It's nice to meet you.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.797
I've heard some good things.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.496
Some interesting things.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.324
Oh.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.716
I-I'm sorry, it's just,

14:51.760 --> 14:53.544
I had a dream and...

14:53.588 --> 14:54.589
you were in it.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.547
You were Weinstein's lawyer.

14:56.591 --> 14:57.722
Really?

14:57.766 --> 14:58.941
Oh, my God.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.639
Well, I didn't do
very well, did I?

15:01.683 --> 15:03.293
It was nice meeting you.

15:05.774 --> 15:07.732
Uh, hey, Diane?

15:07.776 --> 15:09.821
Do you have a minute?

15:09.865 --> 15:12.346
I'm arguing in front of the
judge who used to work here.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.869
- Oh, Julius?
- Yes, Judge Cain.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.436
And I...

15:15.479 --> 15:16.959
was wondering...

15:17.003 --> 15:18.700
if you could sit at my table?

15:18.743 --> 15:20.373
- It won't make any difference.
- Maybe not.

15:20.397 --> 15:22.530
But we need any edge we can get.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.751
May I ask you something?

15:26.795 --> 15:28.928
What were you writing in there?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.799
- In your notes?
- Oh, nothing.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.410
It looked like... dots.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.239
It's just something I do.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.588
You draw dots?

15:37.632 --> 15:38.633
Yes.

15:38.676 --> 15:39.982
Can I see?

15:44.813 --> 15:46.946
I know, people think I'm crazy.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.556
I've been doing it
for a while now.

15:48.599 --> 15:51.689
I'm up to 989,000.

15:51.733 --> 15:52.952
Why?

15:54.344 --> 15:55.824
It's calming.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.870
I used to take notes.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.350
Verbatim notes

16:00.394 --> 16:03.266
on every deposition,
every meeting,

16:03.310 --> 16:04.659
trial, negotiation, and then

16:04.702 --> 16:07.401
I would go home and make
notes on those notes.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.924
And then I would
review those notes

16:08.968 --> 16:10.534
and make even more notes and...

16:10.578 --> 16:12.797
I... was an obsessive writer.

16:12.841 --> 16:16.279
As a kid, it was my diary.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.586
And then in college, my journal.

16:18.629 --> 16:22.416
And then five years ago, I...

16:22.459 --> 16:24.679
lost my notebooks in a cab.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.898
And then my hair fell out...

16:26.942 --> 16:29.945
because I was so worried.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.078
But you know what happened?

16:33.514 --> 16:34.819
Nothing.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.319
Everything I ever wrote,
it didn't matter.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.885
Everything everybody wrote...
Pointless.

16:37.909 --> 16:40.564
And that's when I started
drawing dots.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.784
I felt... like

16:42.827 --> 16:44.829
I accomplished something

16:44.873 --> 16:46.744
every time I completed a book.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.008
And I'm almost up to a million.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.490
So now when I watch the news,

16:53.534 --> 16:57.016
when I... see what's
going on in the world...

16:58.843 --> 17:01.542
when I realize how little
impact I have...

17:03.674 --> 17:05.676
I draw dots.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.473
There is no work here, is there?

17:19.516 --> 17:21.344
- Sure there is.
- Where?

17:21.388 --> 17:23.738
We spent the whole day
at a resort.

17:23.781 --> 17:24.826
Don't you like it here?

17:24.869 --> 17:26.045
Yes, but I feel guilty.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.524
I need to work.

17:27.568 --> 17:28.873
- This iswork.
- Bianca.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.527
Seriously!

17:30.571 --> 17:32.355
This...

17:32.399 --> 17:33.530
is the work.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.402
- "This"?
- Yep.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.578
I want to buy it.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.362
The whole resort.

17:39.406 --> 17:41.756
I'm not joking. Here.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.063
See if you think
it's a good deal.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.679
And you're all
willing to testify?

17:51.722 --> 17:52.897
Yeah.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.421
I saw Meyer kill a girl.

17:54.464 --> 17:55.746
She couldn't have been
more than 12.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.380
One shot with a sniper rifle.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.904
Do you think Laney went too
far, sabotaging his gun?

17:59.948 --> 18:02.777
No, we complained about Meyer
up the chain of command.

18:02.820 --> 18:05.084
But nobody did anything.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.868
So we use

18:06.911 --> 18:09.610
their testimony to
substantiateLaney's account.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.525
Yeah, and go after Meyer.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.615
Wait, isn't it a mistake to go
after a superior officer?

18:14.658 --> 18:16.834
No, Laney's being
court-martialed

18:16.878 --> 18:19.881
under Article 92,
which is a double-edged sword.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.753
It's wrong to "willfully
disobey a lawful command

18:22.797 --> 18:24.407
of a superior officer."

18:24.451 --> 18:25.669
The key word is "lawful."

18:25.713 --> 18:27.497
A soldier has an affirmative
duty to disobey,

18:27.541 --> 18:29.499
or even prevent,
an unlawful order.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.848
So we prove

18:30.892 --> 18:32.589
that Meyer's command
was unlawful,

18:32.633 --> 18:34.765
and that Laney was... was right

18:34.809 --> 18:36.811
- in trying to stop him?
- Yeah.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.164
Did you enjoy serving?

18:42.208 --> 18:43.948
Uh...

18:43.992 --> 18:45.602
in Afghanistan, yeah, I did.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.474
Why?

18:47.517 --> 18:50.129
- I liked my squad.
- Oh.

18:51.695 --> 18:52.827
Did you ever kill anyone?

18:52.870 --> 18:55.482
I did, from afar.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.918
Was that hard?

18:56.961 --> 18:58.180
No.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.616
Would you go back?

18:59.660 --> 19:00.922
Yeah.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.880
So why lawyering?

19:02.924 --> 19:05.187
I like this country.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.971
I've seen other places
I don't like.

19:07.015 --> 19:09.757
And I want it to stay the same.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.456
Well...

19:13.500 --> 19:14.631
What are you thinking?

19:14.675 --> 19:15.893
Uh...

19:15.937 --> 19:17.634
I was just thinking
that I haven't

19:17.678 --> 19:18.983
lived much of a life.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.028
No.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.161
No, you have.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.207
I know enough to know
that you have.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.474
This, this,

19:31.518 --> 19:33.017
this is how we got
in trouble last time.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.216
Yeah, I know.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.697
But I...

19:36.740 --> 19:38.264
I didn't mind it.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.572
Caleb, I am your...

19:42.616 --> 19:44.183
Superior?

19:50.058 --> 19:52.234
Where should we go?

19:54.802 --> 19:56.543
Get me the defense motion
from...

19:56.586 --> 19:58.719
How are you, Judge?

19:58.762 --> 20:00.634
Good.

20:00.677 --> 20:02.940
Who are you?

20:05.160 --> 20:07.162
Just a visitor.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.991
I was hearing about you when
you were at Reddick/Boseman.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.298
You were on everyone's
shortlist for a judgeship.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.607
Is there, uh, something
I can help you with, sir?

20:17.651 --> 20:19.696
Oh, no, no, you're
doing great already.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.611
Your instincts are
right on the money.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.135
And you're young enough
to go the distance, so...

20:24.179 --> 20:26.225
- maybe I can help you.
- With what?

20:26.268 --> 20:28.227
I move people up the ladder.

20:29.576 --> 20:31.186
What are you talking about?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.667
You don't become an appellate
judge by seniority.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.843
You get there by listening.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.280
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.064
Just wanted to say hello.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.283
Who are you?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.633
My number.

20:43.677 --> 20:46.288
Oh, I ran into Oscar Griegson
in the hall.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.681
He's before you today.

20:47.724 --> 20:48.899
He's a big donor.

20:53.339 --> 20:55.166
I'll tell him I spoke to you.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.696
All stand.

21:02.739 --> 21:05.655
Mr. Oscar Griegson
and Ms. Chang,

21:05.699 --> 21:07.788
approach, please.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.575
I've read your papers in
supportof a 60-day continuance,

21:12.619 --> 21:15.143
Mr. Griegson. Denied.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.927
Excuse me,

21:16.971 --> 21:18.601
- Your Honor?
- Ms. Chang, are you ready
to proceed?

21:18.625 --> 21:20.148
- I am.
- I-I would like to remind

21:20.191 --> 21:23.325
the court that... the defense

21:23.369 --> 21:25.849
simply isn't prepared
to go forward at this time.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.851
You've got
until 1:00 p.m. today.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.331
If that's still not enough time,

21:29.375 --> 21:31.768
I'm sure Ms. Chang here
would be happy

21:31.812 --> 21:34.945
to accept my default judgment
against you.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.599
Next case, people! Let's go!

21:36.643 --> 21:39.776
The facts of the case
aren't in dispute.

21:39.820 --> 21:42.126
Corporal Laney
confessed on the stand

21:42.170 --> 21:45.304
that he stole an M24 sniper
rifle from Sergeant Meyer,

21:45.347 --> 21:49.220
his superior, and sabotaged it.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.329
The next day, Sergeant Meyer
tried to use that weapon

21:51.353 --> 21:53.660
on a patrol, and,
instead of killing the target,

21:53.703 --> 21:58.012
his bullet hit translator
Ahmad Mowad in the head,

21:58.055 --> 21:59.187
killing him instantly.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.145
This should be cut and dried.

22:01.189 --> 22:04.148
But the civilian defense team
will try to muddy the waters.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.629
They'll tell you
the problem isn't Laney.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.892
It's Sergeant Meyer.

22:08.936 --> 22:12.635
So let me tell you about him,
before they do.

22:12.679 --> 22:16.073
Sergeant Meyer
is an exemplary soldier.

22:16.117 --> 22:18.859
- So brave in combat...
- -Let me take the opening.

22:18.902 --> 22:21.078
- Why?
- Who delivers it matters.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.080
What? Because I'm a woman?

22:23.124 --> 22:26.170
No, because you're a
civilian.-BRIGHAM: The defense will try

22:26.214 --> 22:27.409
to vilify Sergeant Meyer
in an attempt

22:27.433 --> 22:30.392
- to shore up their weak case.
- No, let me.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.786
But I think you will agree,
Corporal Laney

22:32.829 --> 22:34.657
committed a criminal offense
contrary

22:34.701 --> 22:36.833
to Article 92 of the UCMJ.

22:36.877 --> 22:39.358
That is all, Honor Advocate.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.360
Thank you. Defense?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.711
Good morning.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.366
- The prosecutor...
- There's no prosecutor here.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.411
Trial counsel and defense.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.674
Of course.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.850
Trial counsel,
Mr. Brigham...

22:53.894 --> 22:55.461
Major Brigham.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.812
Thank you, Your Honor.

22:58.855 --> 23:02.032
Major Brigham would have
you believe that the defendant

23:02.076 --> 23:03.686
is a rogue actor

23:03.730 --> 23:05.688
and that his behavior was driven

23:05.732 --> 23:07.951
by resentment
of a superior officer.

23:07.995 --> 23:12.391
Instead, he had real
and justified anxiety

23:12.434 --> 23:15.263
that Sergeant Meyer...

23:15.306 --> 23:17.265
was a dangerous man.

23:17.308 --> 23:19.006
As you listen
from the jury box...

23:19.049 --> 23:20.268
There is no jury here.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.792
That is a panel of members.

23:23.837 --> 23:24.925
Of course.

23:31.235 --> 23:33.847
We will prove to you
that Corporal Laney's actions

23:33.890 --> 23:36.197
were brave and reasonable

23:36.240 --> 23:38.199
in light of the circumstances.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.421
And now my cocounsel

23:42.464 --> 23:44.205
will walk you
through those reasons.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.818
You're right.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.387
Corporal Laney tried,

23:52.431 --> 23:54.084
repeatedly,

23:54.128 --> 23:56.870
to get Sergeant Meyer
to change his behavior.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.219
So did other men in the unit,

23:58.262 --> 23:59.438
other men who will testify

23:59.481 --> 24:02.484
about Meyer's disregard
for human life,

24:02.528 --> 24:04.138
recklessness,

24:04.181 --> 24:06.445
and unwillingness
to follow military protocols

24:06.488 --> 24:09.926
or the laws of war.

24:09.970 --> 24:13.495
What Major Brigham here
wants you to forget

24:13.539 --> 24:16.237
is that there are limits
to obedience,

24:16.280 --> 24:17.934
even in the Army.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.936
Apparently,
he forgot his training.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.111
But I haven't.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.504
I'm sure you haven't either.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.333
The chain of command
doesn't mean

24:25.376 --> 24:27.814
that you do anything
your C.O. tells you.

24:29.032 --> 24:32.296
Every grunt learns
on the first day

24:32.340 --> 24:34.298
that there are commands

24:34.342 --> 24:38.868
and commanders you must disobey.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.393
This is a chess clock.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.526
When you argue motions,
start it,

24:44.570 --> 24:47.529
and you'll have 45 seconds
to complete your argument.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.141
- That is unfair, Your Honor.
- Only for those

24:51.185 --> 24:52.858
- who want to give speeches.
- This is a rocket docket.

24:52.882 --> 24:54.318
That's what you are doing.

24:54.362 --> 24:55.557
If you're objecting, Counselor,

24:55.581 --> 24:58.366
start the clock.

25:00.020 --> 25:03.153
I can't distill my
argument downto 45 seconds.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.415
We're fine over here.

25:04.459 --> 25:07.070
The legal doctrine of laches
says

25:07.114 --> 25:08.985
that when one party
delays unreasonably,

25:09.029 --> 25:10.291
the court may intervene.

25:10.334 --> 25:13.294
So, Mr. Griegson,
you're on notice.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.861
No more delays.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.229
Ms. Chang,
you're the plaintiff here.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.298
You're up first.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.517
Let's go.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.519
Sergeant Meyer, isn't it true

25:20.562 --> 25:22.235
that you are being
court-martialed for murder

25:22.259 --> 25:24.305
-down the hall?
-Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.829
Ms. Reddick wants to distract
from her own client's crimes

25:26.873 --> 25:28.546
- by smearing the witness.
- The accusations

25:28.570 --> 25:31.051
against Sergeant Meyer
are essential

25:31.094 --> 25:34.358
to putting our client's
actionsinto context.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.360
Overruled.
You may answer, Sergeant.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.841
On the advice of counsel,
I assert my right

25:38.885 --> 25:41.452
under the Fifth Amendment
against self-incrimination.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.542
Sergeant, you understand,
if you assert that right,

25:43.585 --> 25:45.544
you cannot answer any question
put to you?

25:48.198 --> 25:50.118
- Yes, Your Honor.
We move
to release the witness.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.438
- If he's not gonna answer
the questions...
Your Honor,

25:51.462 --> 25:52.875
the defense is entitled
to question the witness.

25:52.899 --> 25:54.161
If he doesn't want to answer,

25:54.204 --> 25:55.945
the panel can draw
its own conclusions.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.532
The defense is just hoping
the panel will hold

25:57.556 --> 26:00.210
this exercise of
constitutionalrights against him.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.082
I agree.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.086
You may proceed, Ms. Reddick.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.133
Sergeant Meyer,
isn't it true that you used

26:10.177 --> 26:13.397
a 15-year-old girl
wearing a blue hijab

26:13.441 --> 26:16.313
crossing the town square
as target practice?

26:17.401 --> 26:19.273
I assert
my Fifth Amendment right

26:19.316 --> 26:20.622
against self-incrimination.

26:20.666 --> 26:24.060
Didn't you strangle
a 17-year-old Afghan boy

26:24.104 --> 26:25.168
who was seeking
medical treatment?

26:25.192 --> 26:26.149
I refuse to answer

26:26.193 --> 26:27.300
on the grounds that doing so

26:27.324 --> 26:28.282
may incriminate me.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.631
Isn't it also true

26:29.675 --> 26:33.417
that you collected teeth
and trophies

26:33.461 --> 26:35.265
- from your victims?
- My answer to this question

26:35.289 --> 26:36.986
and to future questions

26:37.030 --> 26:39.336
is I will assert
my Fifth Amendment right

26:39.380 --> 26:41.600
- against self-incrimination.
- If I were innocent,

26:41.643 --> 26:43.427
hearing all these accusations
against me,

26:43.471 --> 26:46.169
I would feel an overwhelming
desire to defend myself.

26:46.213 --> 26:47.344
Objection.

26:47.388 --> 26:49.651
- Sustained.
- Nothing further.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.150
- You may step down, Sergeant.
- Your Honor,

26:51.174 --> 26:52.587
I also have questions
for the witness.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.264
Major Brigham
just finished arguing

26:54.308 --> 26:55.614
that questions were useless.

26:55.657 --> 26:56.658
And he was overruled.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.790
Go ahead, Major.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.401
Isn't it true that Ms. Reddick

27:00.444 --> 27:03.926
hopes that, by making
wildaccusations that you can't deny,

27:03.970 --> 27:06.625
she'll persuade the panel
that you're a dangerous man?

27:10.237 --> 27:11.673
I assert
my Fifth Amendment right

27:11.717 --> 27:13.588
against self-incrimination.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.024
Just to make it clear
how ludicrous

27:15.068 --> 27:16.591
this defense strategy is,

27:16.635 --> 27:18.506
could you please confirm,
Sergeant Meyer,

27:18.549 --> 27:21.161
that you are, in fact,
an alien sun god?

27:23.076 --> 27:25.121
I refuse to, on the grounds

27:25.165 --> 27:26.708
- it may incriminate me.
- Isn't it also true

27:26.732 --> 27:28.647
that you slaughter unicorns,
Sergeant?

27:28.690 --> 27:30.257
On the advice of counsel,

27:30.300 --> 27:31.954
I refuse to answer,

27:31.998 --> 27:33.521
on the grounds
it may incriminate me.

27:33.564 --> 27:36.045
â™ª

27:39.179 --> 27:40.484
Yeah. So, the resort

27:40.528 --> 27:41.660
is in great condition.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.009
No major debts.

27:43.052 --> 27:44.358
Good. So what's the worry?

27:44.401 --> 27:45.576
Hurricane insurance.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.666
That's why the ask is so low.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.972
You'll just have to get
another million off the price.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.234
You play poker?

27:51.278 --> 27:52.583
Do I... What?

27:52.627 --> 27:54.324
Play poker.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.457
I want you to meet some friends.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.067
What?

27:58.111 --> 27:59.068
What is this?

27:59.112 --> 28:00.983
Some friends.

28:01.027 --> 28:03.725
It used to be a book group,
but then we got bored, so...

28:03.769 --> 28:05.292
now it's poker.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.728
What friends?

28:08.251 --> 28:10.166
Oh. Oh, my God.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.168
She's a... she's a mogul,
a billionaire.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.648
No.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.519
Half a billion, on a good day.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.434
And.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.742
- As in...?
- Yes.

28:20.786 --> 28:21.743
The performer?

28:21.787 --> 28:23.179
We call her Tee.

28:23.223 --> 28:24.461
She's just like
everyone else here.

28:24.485 --> 28:26.095
Yeah, Bianca, she's-she's not.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.445
- She's...
- Lucca, you're gonna be fine.

28:28.489 --> 28:29.751
You're late.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.753
- This is your friend?
- Yes. Lucca.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.668
This is, , and.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.365
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hi.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.628
I'm-I'm sor...
I didn't know we were...

28:37.672 --> 28:40.414
- coming or I'd have worn pants.-

28:40.457 --> 28:41.850
Okay!

28:41.894 --> 28:43.480
Let's play or I won't have
timeto kick your asses.

28:43.504 --> 28:45.767
- I'm not really that much
of a poker player.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.682
Oh, we mostly play for charity.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.118
Where are we starting the pot,

28:49.162 --> 28:51.120
- ten or 20?
- Last time, we did 20.

28:51.164 --> 28:54.210
Uh, Bianca,
can I ask a question?

28:55.255 --> 28:56.386
Um...

28:56.430 --> 28:58.345
"Ten or 20," that's...?

28:58.388 --> 29:00.347
- Thousand.
- Yeah, I'm gonna watch.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.175
- No, I'm spotting you.
- No, please,

29:02.218 --> 29:03.500
- I can't pay.
- I'm spotting you.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.047
I want to have some fun tonight.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.222
Come on.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.094
I'm good for it.
I'll spot you 50.

29:08.137 --> 29:09.312
What if I lose?

29:09.356 --> 29:11.097
It goes to charity.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.446
Sit down.

29:12.489 --> 29:13.664
Have some fun.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.319
What's wrong?

29:16.363 --> 29:18.321
Come on. Sit down.
We don't bite.

29:18.365 --> 29:20.759
- We sure don't.
- No. Relax, girl.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.412
We are starting at 15.

29:22.456 --> 29:24.153
- Hey.
- Yeah, on the table.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.589
The champs.
The champs.

29:25.633 --> 29:26.633
The champs.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.702
Currently on C-SPAN,

29:51.746 --> 29:53.095
a glimpse of President Trump

29:53.139 --> 29:55.184
during his valuable
executive time.

29:55.228 --> 29:58.231
We go now to President Trump
in the Oval Office.

30:00.973 --> 30:02.757
Mike Pence!

30:02.801 --> 30:04.933
Where is Mikey Pence?!

30:04.977 --> 30:07.936
All the presidential portraits
are staring at me!

30:07.980 --> 30:11.244
And no one will tell me
which one is Hamilton.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.812
- You called for me,
Mr. President?

30:13.855 --> 30:16.379
What's the latest
on the evangelicals?

30:16.423 --> 30:17.728
Are they still with me?

30:17.772 --> 30:19.121
Till the end of the world.

30:19.165 --> 30:20.340
Or November.

30:20.383 --> 30:21.907
Whichever comes first.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.473
Good, good.

30:23.517 --> 30:27.260
Then I can have
some executive time.

30:29.175 --> 30:30.741
Who's at the door?

30:30.785 --> 30:32.221
Is that the pizza guy?

30:33.919 --> 30:35.224
Thank you.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.879
I smelled hamberders.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.973
â™ª

30:59.422 --> 31:01.207
Scuse me!

31:04.297 --> 31:06.952
It's disgusting,
the way they write about Meghan

31:06.995 --> 31:08.364
compared to the way
they write about Kate.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.129
Well, it is
the British tabloids.

31:10.172 --> 31:11.957
The one-drop rule
is alive and well.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.784
Imagine if Meghan
didn't straighten her hair.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.831
- Okay, where are we?
- It's you.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.354
- I call.
- Pair of sixes.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.530
- I got nothing.
- Read 'em and weep, ladies.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.142
- Full house, twos and nines.
- Damn it.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.317
Three fives.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.535
Lucca?

31:26.972 --> 31:30.410
I swear,
this has never happened to me.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.803
- Oh, just put 'em down.
- What?

31:32.847 --> 31:34.457
Four jacks.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.156
Wow!

31:37.199 --> 31:39.549
Well, go ahead,
take the pot, bitch.

31:39.593 --> 31:42.335
- Okay, sushi break.
- A short one.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.903
Give me time to win it back.

31:46.078 --> 31:48.123
Um, no, Bianca, I...

31:48.167 --> 31:51.344
- I can't take this.
- Sure you can.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.148
They can afford it.
Plus, they're having a blast.

31:53.172 --> 31:55.478
Uh, yeah, but, uh, it wasn't
my money to start with,

31:55.522 --> 31:57.524
- it was yours.-So?
If someone gives you money

31:57.567 --> 31:59.352
to go to a carnival, and you win

31:59.395 --> 32:01.876
a stuffed animal or a goldfish,
do you give it back?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.487
Yeah, but this-this is nota
goldfish or a stuffed animal.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.489
How about I quit,

32:06.533 --> 32:09.405
- and youplay with my winnings.
- No. You're being ridiculous.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.973
You can pay me back the
original50, but the rest is yours.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.976
Look, if you're
that uncomfortable, just lose.

32:16.369 --> 32:18.980
Okay. So, how much is there?

32:19.024 --> 32:20.112
Half a million.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.852
What?

32:21.896 --> 32:23.854
But don't forget: 20%...

32:23.898 --> 32:25.856
goes to charity.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.402
â™ª

32:54.450 --> 32:56.061
Out.

33:02.589 --> 33:03.938
Call.

33:05.157 --> 33:07.115
- Let's see it.
- I have nothing.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.030
Two threes.

33:10.249 --> 33:12.381
Damn it. It's yours.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.600
What? What-what do you have?

33:13.643 --> 33:15.036
Nothing.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.907
It's yours, Lucca!

33:16.951 --> 33:18.561
Congratulations!

33:18.605 --> 33:21.912
A million and a half dollars!

33:21.956 --> 33:23.436
â™ª

33:29.007 --> 33:31.226
- We got a problem.
- What?

33:31.270 --> 33:33.011
Trump's Twitter feed?

33:33.054 --> 33:34.360
Damn. "Sergeant Meyer

33:34.403 --> 33:35.926
"is one of our great fighters.

33:35.970 --> 33:38.364
"Effective immediately,
I'm pardoning him

33:38.407 --> 33:41.280
- so he can continue to serve
this great country."
Jesus.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.195
"Stop hounding him,

33:43.238 --> 33:44.500
and get back to business."

33:49.679 --> 33:53.118
Okay, okay,
so we-we still havethe squad members

33:53.161 --> 33:56.077
to testify to what Meyer did;
the pardon doesn't matter.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.687
No. They're not testifying.

33:57.731 --> 33:59.646
- What? How do you know?
- I called them.

33:59.689 --> 34:01.450
First thing I did.
They're worried about Meyer,

34:01.474 --> 34:03.495
now that he's pardoned,
that he's gonna come after them.

34:03.519 --> 34:05.260
Oh, my God.

34:05.304 --> 34:08.959
These guys fight terrorists
and they dismantle IEDs.

34:09.003 --> 34:12.963
- I don't understandwhy they're afraid
to speak up.-It's not cowardice.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.680
Meyer keeps his command, he's
back to being their superior.

34:14.704 --> 34:17.142
They got to work with him again.
They may have to work

34:17.185 --> 34:20.188
- with him for years.-All right, that...
makes sense.

34:20.232 --> 34:22.277
You know, there is...

34:22.321 --> 34:26.020
one witness we can call now.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.721
Thank you.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.731
Wake up, Cinderella.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.344
Ten-hut!

34:47.520 --> 34:49.043
At ease.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.090
Does the defense
have anything else?

34:52.133 --> 34:53.502
We have one more witness,
Your Honor.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.373
The defense recalls
Sergeant Meyer to the stand.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.399
The defense has already wasted
the court's time

34:57.443 --> 35:00.098
-with this cynical tactic,
Your Honor.
-The sergeant made it clear

35:00.141 --> 35:02.032
- he would not answer
your questions, Ms. Reddick.
- Yes.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.450
But within the last 24 hours,
the sergeant has been pardoned

35:04.493 --> 35:06.147
for his actions in Afghanistan,

35:06.191 --> 35:08.323
so he no longer has
a Fifth Amendment right.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.387
- He must answer.
- Your Honor...

35:09.411 --> 35:10.543
The Supreme Court precedent

35:10.586 --> 35:12.545
is Burdick v. United States.

35:12.588 --> 35:15.069
The relevant passages are there.

35:16.723 --> 35:19.073
Recall Sergeant Meyer.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.166
Sergeant, isn't it true

35:25.210 --> 35:27.777
that Mr. Ahmad Mowad was shot

35:27.821 --> 35:30.128
in the afternoon
around 3:00 p.m.?

35:30.171 --> 35:31.955
Uh... 1500 hours?

35:31.999 --> 35:33.957
I plead the Fifth,
same as before.

35:34.001 --> 35:36.569
You must answer
the questions, Sergeant.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.179
You have
no Fifth Amendment right.

35:41.487 --> 35:45.099
So it's true you shot
Mr. Mowadat 1500 hours?

35:47.667 --> 35:49.712
- Affirmative.
- And Corporal Laney

35:49.756 --> 35:52.672
has admitted to taking
your gunaround dinnertime

35:52.715 --> 35:54.630
the evening before.
Can you confirm that he had

35:54.674 --> 35:55.954
access to your gun at that time?

35:55.979 --> 35:57.503
- Yes.
- And at no other time

35:57.546 --> 35:59.200
before Mr. Mowad was killed?

35:59.244 --> 36:01.550
- That's right.
- I have a document here

36:01.594 --> 36:03.465
stating that you practice

36:03.509 --> 36:05.641
- every morning with your gun.
- Objection.

36:05.685 --> 36:07.208
Trial counsel
has not been given a copy

36:07.252 --> 36:09.055
- of this mysterious document.
- This is a transcript

36:09.079 --> 36:11.125
of your opening statement,
Major.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.520
I'm assuming you told the truth.

36:14.563 --> 36:16.522
Overruled, Major.

36:16.565 --> 36:19.655
Actually, we did more
than assume; we checked.

36:19.699 --> 36:24.007
The AAMS keeps a log
of bullets used

36:24.051 --> 36:25.487
during target practice.

36:25.531 --> 36:29.012
Sergeant, isn't this your name
right here,

36:29.056 --> 36:31.232
practicing on the morning
that Mr. Mowad was killed?

36:31.276 --> 36:32.842
- Yes.
- So you knew

36:32.886 --> 36:35.715
that your gun was working fine
that morning,

36:35.758 --> 36:38.674
whatever Corporal Laney did
the night before?

36:38.718 --> 36:39.849
- No.
- Sergeant.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.677
Before you continue,

36:41.721 --> 36:44.550
uh, please understand
that you were only pardoned

36:44.593 --> 36:46.813
for your actions in Afghanistan.

36:46.856 --> 36:48.989
And if you lie
on the stand today,

36:49.032 --> 36:50.599
that's a new crime:

36:50.643 --> 36:52.079
perjury.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.212
And that's why
the prosecutor's here.

36:54.255 --> 36:56.910
So you knew
that your gun was working fine

36:56.953 --> 36:59.608
when you shot the translator?

37:00.653 --> 37:02.220
Sergeant?

37:04.874 --> 37:06.920
I may... I may have.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.922
Nothing further.

37:11.751 --> 37:14.710
Sergeant, the difference
betweena civilian and a combatant

37:14.754 --> 37:16.277
isn't quite as clear
in Afghanistan

37:16.321 --> 37:17.931
as we might imagine, is it?

37:17.974 --> 37:19.933
- No, it isn't.
- For example,

37:19.976 --> 37:21.935
don't terrorists send children
and the elderly

37:21.978 --> 37:24.024
to find American sniper nests,

37:24.067 --> 37:25.721
assuming we'll be
too squeamish to shoot,

37:25.765 --> 37:27.941
so they can use that
informationto set traps

37:27.984 --> 37:30.160
- for our soldiers?
- That is correct.

37:30.204 --> 37:33.120
In this tweet, President Trump
calls you a warrior...

37:33.163 --> 37:34.904
-Objection.-This is our commander in chief,

37:34.948 --> 37:37.864
Your Honor, speaking to an issue
pertinent to this court.

37:37.907 --> 37:39.953
Ask your question.

37:39.996 --> 37:42.129
President Trump calls you
a warrior, Sergeant,

37:42.172 --> 37:46.089
and says, "I see nothing wrongwith
how Sergeant Meyer behaved.

37:46.133 --> 37:48.831
"He was only doing his duty.

37:48.875 --> 37:52.095
We need our warriors
to be tough these days."

37:52.139 --> 37:53.575
Do you believe...

37:53.619 --> 37:55.751
Corporal Laney,
your subordinate,

37:55.795 --> 37:57.884
not only disobeyed orders

37:57.927 --> 38:01.017
but prevented you
from doing your duty?

38:01.061 --> 38:02.671
Yes.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.978
Nothing further.

38:05.979 --> 38:07.720
Well?

38:07.763 --> 38:09.287
I can't tell.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.775
There you go.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.951
- What's this?
- A file.

38:21.995 --> 38:23.823
- For what?
- Some case.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.870
Well...?

38:27.914 --> 38:29.089
Well, what?

38:29.132 --> 38:30.743
Tell me. What'd you do?

38:30.786 --> 38:33.006
I... helped her buy a resort.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.356
You're kidding.
Oh, my God.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.010
But I'm still
the better friend, right?

38:37.053 --> 38:38.968
Always.
So, I have a question for you.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.622
Hit me.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.364
I won some money playing poker,

38:43.408 --> 38:45.801
- and she lent me my stake.
- How much?

38:45.845 --> 38:48.804
- How much did she lend?
- No, how much did you win?

38:50.371 --> 38:52.330
Fifteen hundred.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.636
Oh. Well,
that was anticlimactic.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.639
But she lent me the money
to bet, so...

38:57.683 --> 38:59.902
shouldn't I give her
all the winnings?

38:59.946 --> 39:02.165
No. She doesn't need $1,500.

39:02.209 --> 39:04.167
- Keep it.
- What if it's a lot more?

39:04.211 --> 39:05.821
Don't ask me how much.

39:05.865 --> 39:07.127
- Okay?
- Okay.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.347
- How much?
- No matter how much money,

39:09.390 --> 39:11.653
- I should give it all
to her, right?
- No.

39:11.697 --> 39:13.176
If you feel guilty,
get her a gift.

39:13.220 --> 39:14.874
Something a rich person needs.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.658
What does a rich person need?

39:16.702 --> 39:17.877
Love.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.711
Have you, um... started?

39:28.061 --> 39:29.671
- Mm.
- All rise.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.847
- You look calmer.
- Well...

39:31.891 --> 39:33.675
what have we got?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.416
Lonergan vs. Syncrest, Inc.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.896
Eminent domain.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.898
Ah. Counselors,

39:38.941 --> 39:40.682
welcome back.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.162
Is everybody ready to get going?

39:42.205 --> 39:44.251
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Actually, Your Honor,

39:44.294 --> 39:46.340
my client is unable
to be here today.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.081
- Aw. Why is that?
- He's in New York

39:48.124 --> 39:50.213
ringing the opening bell
at the stock exchange.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.781
- Oh. Impressive.
- Your Honor,

39:52.825 --> 39:55.741
the defendant is still harming
my client's business.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.806
You're suggesting, Counselor,
that any further delays

39:57.830 --> 39:59.745
- might be prejudicial?
- Yes,

39:59.788 --> 40:01.790
- and if I may explain...
- No need.

40:01.834 --> 40:04.097
I agree.
Injunction granted.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.447
- Your Honor, if I...
- No. You had 24 hours

40:06.491 --> 40:08.449
to present your client...
You failed.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.756
Judgment for the plaintiff.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.281
Congratulations.

40:17.327 --> 40:18.764
Well, thank you, Diane.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.766
I think he saw you over here.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.986
No, I don't think that was it.

40:28.121 --> 40:29.514
Enter.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.256
Diane. What's up?

40:33.300 --> 40:35.389
I think you and I
should have lunch.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.913
- Why?
- To trade information

40:37.957 --> 40:39.959
about Memo 618.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.098
So, what do you think?

40:49.142 --> 40:51.318
I can never tell.

40:52.493 --> 40:55.540
Have you reached a verdict?

41:07.813 --> 41:09.815
Corporal Laney, please stand.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.296
On the charge
of negligent homicide,

41:13.340 --> 41:16.299
the panel finds the defendant,
Army Corporal Demarcus Laney,

41:16.343 --> 41:17.518
not guilty.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.781
On the charge
of insubordination,

41:19.825 --> 41:21.217
not guilty.
And on the charge

41:21.261 --> 41:24.133
of damage to military property, guilty.

41:24.177 --> 41:27.876
The panel imposes a sentence
of time served.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.399
Corporal Laney, you may go.

41:29.443 --> 41:33.099
- Court adjourned.
- Attention!

41:37.190 --> 41:40.236
- Nice work.
- You, too.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.500
- Feels good to win for a change.-

41:45.328 --> 41:47.505
You have to get home to Malcolm?

41:47.548 --> 41:49.507
Oh, uh...

41:49.550 --> 41:52.161
no, Malcolm is, uh,
with his father tonight.

41:52.205 --> 41:54.294
Want to grab dinner?

41:55.338 --> 41:57.210
â™ª

42:09.396 --> 42:10.919
What are we doing?

42:10.963 --> 42:12.486
We're experimenting.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.835
Yeah.

42:13.879 --> 42:15.881
â™ª

42:20.450 --> 42:22.409
How much?

42:22.452 --> 42:24.150
Without the frills.

42:24.193 --> 42:26.544
Someone left a gift for you.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.546
â™ª

42:30.243 --> 42:32.027
No. Come to me in good faith,

42:32.071 --> 42:33.855
and I might change my mind.

42:33.899 --> 42:36.031
I'll call you back.
