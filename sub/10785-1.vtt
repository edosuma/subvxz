WEBVTT

00:28.583 --> 00:30.417
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:31.917 --> 00:33.834
A KISS.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.250
I THINK.

00:37.667 --> 00:39.291
YOU KISSED ME.

00:41.667 --> 00:42.250
I KNOW.

00:49.500 --> 00:53.041
SO...

00:53.041 --> 00:54.750
UH...

00:54.750 --> 00:57.875
SO...

00:57.875 --> 01:00.917
YEAH, WELL...

01:00.917 --> 01:02.542
WELL, WHAT?

01:02.542 --> 01:04.125
WELL, THAT WAS A KISS.

01:05.542 --> 01:07.667
I'LL SAY.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.041
SO NOW WHAT?

01:13.708 --> 01:14.208
I DON'T KNOW.

01:16.375 --> 01:17.625
ME, EITHER.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.417
WELL, UM...

01:21.417 --> 01:23.208
MAYBE WE COULD--
WHAT?

01:25.417 --> 01:26.333
UH, NOTHING.

01:26.333 --> 01:28.667
NO, NO. YOU WERE
GONNA SAY SOMETHING.

01:28.667 --> 01:30.417
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA SAY?

01:30.417 --> 01:32.417
NOTHING. I--I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW.

01:32.417 --> 01:36.000
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS GOING TO SAY.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.041
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

01:37.041 --> 01:39.959
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING, RIGHT?

01:39.959 --> 01:42.417
ACTUALLY, DAWSON,
I DON'T HAVE A THOUGHT
IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW.

01:42.417 --> 01:45.250
BUT, APPARENTLY, THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING,
SO--

01:45.250 --> 01:47.125
NO, NO. I--

01:48.083 --> 01:50.750
LOOK...
LET'S SLEEP ON IT.

01:52.041 --> 01:56.291
NOT TOGETHER!
I MEAN, YOU IN YOUR BED
AND ME IN MINE.

01:56.291 --> 01:57.375
RIGHT. ABSOLUTELY.

01:57.375 --> 01:58.500
O-OBVIOUSLY.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.542
WE'LL SLEEP ON IT...

02:00.542 --> 02:02.583
WAKE UP, AND, UM...

02:02.583 --> 02:05.208
THIS'LL ALL BE A DREAM.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.625
YOU MEAN,
LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED?

02:09.625 --> 02:11.000
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.708
IS THAT WHAT YOU  WANT?

02:14.333 --> 02:17.083
O-OK. POOF.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.166
DIDN'T HAPPEN, DAWSON.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.458
SEE YA LATER.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.417
JOEY!

02:22.625 --> 02:25.250
JOEY.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.542
DON'T EVEN THINK OF CLIMBING
THROUGH THAT WINDOW.

04:07.792 --> 04:10.041
HI.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.000
HI.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.667
IS EVERYTHING OK?

04:12.667 --> 04:14.083
MM-HMM.

04:14.083 --> 04:18.208
I WAS JUST
LYING HERE WAITING.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.125
WAITING FOR WHAT?

04:20.125 --> 04:21.416
WELL...

04:21.416 --> 04:23.625
I DON'T HAVE TO BE IN
UNTIL 9:00 TODAY.

04:23.625 --> 04:28.041
AND OF ALL THE POSSIBLE WAYS
TO SPEND A FREE MORNING,

04:28.041 --> 04:29.417
THERE IS ONE IDEA

04:29.417 --> 04:34.125
THAT JUST KIND OF
SEEMS TO STAND OUT.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.125
MMM, GALE...

04:37.125 --> 04:40.667
YOU CAN PROTEST
IF YOU WANT,

04:40.667 --> 04:43.250
BUT RESISTANCE WILL
ONLY MAKE THE CONQUEST
THAT MUCH SWEETER.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.792
GALE, GALE,
I HAVE TO SHOWER.

04:45.792 --> 04:46.875
I HAVE A MEETING.

04:46.875 --> 04:50.125
THAT'S OK. THIS ACT
PLAYS UNDERWATER, TOO.

04:51.667 --> 04:52.166
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.667
GALE...GALE.

04:56.792 --> 04:57.375
RIGHT.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.917
SHOWER...MEETING.

04:59.917 --> 05:01.875
YEAH.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.625
I COULD JUST OPEN
MY MOUTH AND SCREAM.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.041
I HATE THIS TRUCK!
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING!

05:19.041 --> 05:20.625
HEY, THESE THINGS
HAPPEN, BESSIE.

05:20.625 --> 05:22.333
DON'T LET IT
GET YOU DOWN.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.834
YOUR MORNING GLOW
IS HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS.

05:25.834 --> 05:28.125
HOW MANY CUPS OF COFFEE
DID YOU HAVE?

05:28.125 --> 05:30.291
CAN'T A PERSON BE
IN A GOOD MOOD?

05:30.291 --> 05:32.375
A PERSON CAN, BUT YOU?
YOU'RE MISS PERMA-SCOWL.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.959
SO WHAT AREN'T
YOU TELLING ME?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.500
NOTHING.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.333
THEN WHAT'S
WITH THAT LOOK?

05:38.333 --> 05:39.291
WHAT LOOK?

05:39.291 --> 05:40.834
YOU HAVE THIS LOOK,

05:40.834 --> 05:44.000
THIS CHEERY YET SNEAKY
I-GOT-LUCKY LOOK.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.708
I KNOW THIS LOOK.
BESSIE!

05:45.708 --> 05:48.875
NOW, WAIT A SECOND.
WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

05:48.875 --> 05:50.417
NOWHERE.

05:51.792 --> 05:52.291
DAWSON'S.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.375
START TALKIN'.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.959
YOU KNOW,
I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON
YOU GOT ME UP THIS MORNING

05:56.959 --> 05:58.000
FOR THE MORNING TRIM.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.250
SO COME ON, SET THE STAGE.
I WANT DETAILS.

05:59.250 --> 06:02.333
UM...WELL,
IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.417
IT WAS, IN A WORD...

06:04.417 --> 06:05.500
Joey: HOT.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.083
EXTREMELY HOT.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.000
SO WHAT KIND
OF KISS WAS IT--

06:09.000 --> 06:10.500
PECK ON THE CHEEK,
PROBING TONGUES,

06:10.500 --> 06:11.333
FINGERS CLAWING
AT YOUR NECK?

06:11.333 --> 06:12.291
BESSIE--
DID HE TOUCH YOUR...

06:12.291 --> 06:14.583
THINGAMAJIG?
GET OUT OF THE GUTTER.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.041
NO THINGAMAJIGS INVOLVED.

06:16.041 --> 06:17.750
IT WAS JUST, UM...

06:17.750 --> 06:21.125
THE SWEETEST, MOST ROMANTIC,
FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKY,

06:21.125 --> 06:23.041
WAVES CRASHING ON THE SHORE

06:23.041 --> 06:25.291
BEYOND ANY MOVIE I COULD
EVER IMAGINE KISS.

06:25.291 --> 06:26.542
CONGRATULATIONS, DAWSON.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

06:26.542 --> 06:29.375
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
ARE YA GONNA DO IT?

06:29.375 --> 06:31.708
DON'T GO THERE,
BESS,

06:31.708 --> 06:33.417
OR I'LL EXTINGUISH
THIS CONVERSATION
RIGHT NOW!

06:33.417 --> 06:35.959
OK. ALL RIGHT.

06:35.959 --> 06:37.708
SO...WHAT'S NEXT?

06:37.708 --> 06:39.917
AFTER YOU KISS SOMEBODY,
THINGS CHANGE.

06:39.917 --> 06:40.917
QUESTIONS ARISE.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.375
WHAT QUESTIONS?

06:42.375 --> 06:44.959
DOES THIS KILL FRANCE?

06:44.959 --> 06:47.333
WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED IT.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.458
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.125
AFTER YEARS
OF GRATUITOUS
SELF-EXAMINATION,

06:50.125 --> 06:51.375
YOU FINALLY DID IT.
YOU ACTED.

06:51.375 --> 06:52.500
I THOUGHT YOU AND JOEY
WERE GONNA DRAW OUT

06:52.500 --> 06:54.667
THIS WHOLE WILL THEY/
WON'T THEY DRAMA

06:54.667 --> 06:55.959
FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER
COUPLE OF YEARS,

06:55.959 --> 06:57.375
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
SAM AND DIANE,

06:57.375 --> 06:59.667
THEY DIDN'T GET TOGETHER
FOR AT LEAST 4 SEASONS,

06:59.667 --> 07:00.500
AND MULDER AND SCULLY,
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN KISSED

07:00.500 --> 07:04.083
THIS REALLY
INSPIRES ME, MAN.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.041
IF YOU AND JOEY
CAN GET PAST

07:06.041 --> 07:07.792
THE WHOLE ROMANTIC
CHECKMATE THING

07:07.792 --> 07:09.583
YOU'VE BEEN IN FOR
GOD-KNOWS-HOW-MANY YEARS,

07:09.583 --> 07:10.333
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

07:10.333 --> 07:13.083
ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN, PACEY.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.750
NO. I'M SERIOUS HERE.
I CAN CHANGE, TOO.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.542
I CAN BE PACEY WITTER,BAD-ASS
STUD AND MAN ABOUT TOWN.

07:17.542 --> 07:21.166
I CAN SCORE WITH
HIGH-QUALITY CHICKS.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.291
CHRISTY LIVINGSTONE,
PAR EXEMPLE.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.083
SENIOR CHEERLEADER?

07:27.083 --> 07:29.792
LET'S NOT ABANDON
ALL SENSE OF REALITY HERE.

07:29.792 --> 07:32.125
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO MORE
NEGATIVE THOUGHTS.

07:32.125 --> 07:35.583
YOU KNOW WHAT, MOLLY?
I NEED A NEW LOOK.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.500
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE--WE FROST MY TIPS
OR SOMETHING?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.083
FROST YOUR TIPS?

07:41.083 --> 07:42.417
YEAH.

08:08.125 --> 08:09.667
HEY! CHRISTY!

08:12.834 --> 08:14.208
[STARTS ENGINE]

08:17.041 --> 08:18.750
OH, GOD!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.875
OH!

08:21.875 --> 08:24.542
THIS IS GREAT.
MY FATHER'S GONNA KILL ME.

08:27.959 --> 08:30.625
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.125
OFFICER, PLEASE,
I AM SO SORRY.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.582
OFFICER?
I DIDN'T SEE
YOU PULL OUT.

08:33.582 --> 08:34.958
I MEAN, I DID
SEE YOU PULLING OUT,

08:34.958 --> 08:37.041
BUT IT WAS
SO ABRUPT THAT--

08:37.041 --> 08:37.917
MM-HMM.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.082
OH, GOD. I JUST
GOT MY LICENSE.

08:39.082 --> 08:41.542
PLEASE BE KIND?

08:41.542 --> 08:44.750
I'LL HAVE TO SEE THAT LICENSE
AND YOUR REGISTRATION, TOO,
LITTLE MISS.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.583
MM-HMM.

08:52.583 --> 08:55.750
ANDIE McPHEE. RHODE ISLAND
DRIVER'S LICENSE?

08:55.750 --> 08:58.208
UH, YES, SIR.
SEE, MY FAMILY
JUST MOVED TO TOWN.

08:58.208 --> 09:01.166
WE LIVE OVER ON WINDSOR.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.041
COUNTRY CLUB.

09:03.041 --> 09:06.083
YES. IS THAT
A DETRIMENT?

09:06.083 --> 09:11.125
DO YOU REALIZE THE SEVERITY
OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE, HMM?

09:11.125 --> 09:12.291
DO YOU?

09:12.291 --> 09:15.750
SITTING BEHIND THE WHEEL
OF A VERY POWERFUL

09:15.750 --> 09:18.834
AND DANGEROUS
AUTOMOBILE IS
A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.250
ONE LAPSE IN JUDGMENT,
AND YOU COULD RUN OVER
A CAT,

09:21.250 --> 09:23.250
A CHILD, A NUN.

09:23.250 --> 09:27.375
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE THIS
LICENSE REVOKED--[SNAP]--
JUST LIKE THAT.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.208
IN FACT, I THINK
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE YOU IN
AND BOOK YOU RIGHT NOW.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.500
OH, NO, YOU CAN'T--

09:33.500 --> 09:35.208
I MEAN, UM, PLEASE.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.375
DON'T DO THAT.

09:37.375 --> 09:40.792
I JUST GOT THIS LICENSE.
PLEASE DON'T REVOKE IT.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.792
OK. MAYBE I CAN JUST LET
THIS ONE INCIDENT SLIDE,

09:46.792 --> 09:49.250
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I GOT MY EYES ON YOU NOW,
BLONDIE.

09:49.250 --> 09:52.250
YOU CAUSE ANY MORE TROUBLE
IN CAPESIDE,

09:52.250 --> 09:55.291
OFFICER PACEY'S
COMIN' AFTER YOU, HMM?

09:55.291 --> 09:56.250
OK. I UNDERSTAND.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.250
THANK YOU.

09:58.250 --> 10:01.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

10:02.291 --> 10:04.208
OH! UM, IT WAS REALLY
NICE MEETING YOU.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.250
THANK YOU.

10:10.041 --> 10:14.583
THANK YOU, MR. ELLARD.
I APPRECIATE ALL
OF YOUR ADVICE, BUT...

10:19.125 --> 10:21.083
HI.

10:21.959 --> 10:23.166
HEY.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.792
HOW ARE YOU?

10:30.792 --> 10:31.917
UH, GOOD. I'M--I'M--

10:35.125 --> 10:36.875
YEAH. HOW--HOW ARE YOU?

10:41.458 --> 10:44.875
I DON'T KNOW, DAWSON.

10:44.875 --> 10:49.000
I THINK...I MIGHT HAVE MADE
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE.

10:51.834 --> 10:54.667
FRANCE.

10:54.667 --> 10:59.166
I TOLD MR. ELLARD I JUST
WASN'T GOING TO GO.

11:04.291 --> 11:07.208
SO JOEY POTTER'S
STICKING AROUND CAPESIDE
FOR SOME GUY.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.125
MAYBE, IF YOU LIKE,
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU
TO HIM SOMETIME.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.917
OH. OK.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.542
WELL...

11:14.542 --> 11:17.041
HE'S A VERY LUCKY GUY.

11:26.708 --> 11:29.959
BUT SERIOUSLY, DAWSON...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:29.959 --> 11:34.375
I'M--I'M RELIEVED.
I'M...ECSTATIC.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.166
I'M PSYCHED.
I'M--I'M...

11:36.166 --> 11:38.875
AROUSED.

11:38.875 --> 11:39.875
AROUSED?

11:39.875 --> 11:41.250
YEAH.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.500
WELL, PUT YOUR HORMONES
ASIDE FOR NOW, DAWSON.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.291
NO. DAWSON,
JUST FOR A SECOND.

11:45.291 --> 11:49.875
ME NOT GOING TO FRANCE,
YOU AND ME TALKING DIRTY
IN THE HALLS.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.375
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK

11:51.375 --> 11:53.417
WE'RE MAKING SOME
MASSIVE, MONUMENTAL
MISTAKE?

11:53.417 --> 11:55.917
I MEAN, 'CAUSE THINGS
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO
COMPLICATED BETWEEN US.

11:55.917 --> 11:58.375
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

11:58.375 --> 12:02.208
GRANTED, YOU AND I ARE
ENTERING SOME UNCHARTED
BOY/GIRL TERRITORY,

12:02.208 --> 12:03.458
BUT I HONESTLY THINK
THAT REGARDLESS

12:03.458 --> 12:06.208
OF HOW COMPLICATED
THINGS ARE
ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS,

12:06.208 --> 12:08.041
WE'LL BE FINE.

12:08.041 --> 12:12.000
WE'LL JUST CONCENTRATE
ON THE SIMPLE STUFF.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.625
LIKE WHAT?

12:14.625 --> 12:17.125
LIKE A DATE.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.000
A DATE?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.667
MM-HMM.
ME AND YOU
ON A DATE?

12:19.667 --> 12:20.667
YEP.

12:20.667 --> 12:21.708
HMM.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.291
UH, I DON'T KNOW,
DAWSON.

12:24.291 --> 12:26.125
I WAS GONNA
WATCH TV TONIGHT.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.792
I HEAR LUKE PERRY'S
BACK ON 90210.

12:27.792 --> 12:30.500
LOOK, SATURDAY NIGHT
THE RIALTO IS CLOSING.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.166
IT'S THEIR LAST SHOW,
AND I THINK THAT
WE SHOULD GO.

12:34.166 --> 12:37.917
WELL...WILL YOU
STILL BE AROUSED
ON SATURDAY NIGHT?

12:37.917 --> 12:41.250
AH HEH. I THINK I CAN
GUARANTEE IT, YEAH.

12:43.250 --> 12:43.583
Jen: HEY, GUYS.

12:43.583 --> 12:45.792
JEN.

12:45.792 --> 12:46.792
HEY.
HEY.

12:46.792 --> 12:47.792
HOW ARE YA?

12:47.792 --> 12:48.875
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

12:48.875 --> 12:50.291
NOT GREAT.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.458
MY...

12:51.458 --> 12:53.417
MY, UH...

AN OFFICER IS A FELONY.

THE POLICE STATION
AND REPORT YOU.

OF MEDICATION,

YOUR STUPID STUNT,

SPINNING SCENARIOS
IN MY HEAD ABOUT BEING
CARTED OFF TO PRISON

14:22.125 --> 14:26.250
AND BECOMING A SEX SLAVE
TO SOME SADIST NAMED
BOMBER BERTHA.

OK. NOW, CORRECT ME
IF I'M WRONG,

HAVING A LITTLE FUN.

UP A DIFFERENT TREE.

STOP BARKING ALTOGETHER.

LOVELORN LOSERS

15:56.917 --> 16:00.125
THERE ARE PEOPLE
IN THIS COMMUNITY
WHO RELY ON THESE DONATIONS.

BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THAT IT'S A LITTLE EARLY

16:04.041 --> 16:05.250
TO BE CLEARING OUT

16:05.250 --> 16:08.625

NEEDING THESE THINGS.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.291

WE HAVEN'T EVEN
BURIED HIM YET.

16:20.166 --> 16:23.625
WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE ME DO, JENNIFER?

16:23.625 --> 16:26.834
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S
JUST THAT YOU'RE--YOU'RE
NOT EXACTLY THE PICTURE

16:26.834 --> 16:28.000
OF--OF THE GRIEVING WIDOW.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.417
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, JENNIFER.

16:31.417 --> 16:32.959
I LOVED
YOUR GRANDFATHER,

16:32.959 --> 16:35.625
FROM OUR VERY FIRST DATE
THROUGH 43 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE,

16:35.625 --> 16:36.250
AND WHEN HE HAD
HIS STROKE,

16:36.250 --> 16:38.125
I SAT BY HIS BEDSIDE,

16:38.125 --> 16:41.834
AND FOR MONTHS,
ALL I DID WAS PRAY
FOR HIS RECOVERY.

16:41.834 --> 16:42.792
BUT WHEN HIS CONDITION
WORSENED,

16:42.792 --> 16:45.041
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I PRAYED FOR?

16:45.041 --> 16:48.834
NOT FOR HIS RECOVERY...
FOR HIS RELEASE.

16:48.834 --> 16:51.834
I WATCHED HIM WASTE AWAY
IN THAT BED

16:51.834 --> 16:53.458
FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS.

16:53.458 --> 16:58.333
SO WHETHER I CLEAN OUT
HIS CLOSET TODAY OR NOT...

16:58.333 --> 16:59.959

YOU MUST BE THINKING,

THOUGHTS GET THE BEST OF YOU,

HERE IS THE TRUTH.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.000

RAN LONG,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.541
AND AFTER THAT, THERE WAS
TRAFFIC ALL THE WAY UP I-95,

GIVE MORE THAN ONE EXCUSE

YOURSELF TO SOMEBODY,

17:27.959 --> 17:32.041

NEED YOU TO BELIEVE ME.

38:16.667 --> 38:20.125
IT WAS
ONE MEETING, GALE.

38:20.125 --> 38:22.083
WHY?

38:22.083 --> 38:24.250
BECAUSE YOU
WANT A DIVORCE?

38:25.583 --> 38:30.375
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
I CAN STAY MARRIED TO
A WOMAN I LOVE

38:30.375 --> 38:32.458
AND HATE

38:32.458 --> 38:33.542
IN EQUAL MEASURE.

38:37.375 --> 38:39.959
THE REASON THAT
I WENT TO SEE MR. DRAKE

38:39.959 --> 38:42.625
IS BECAUSE
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE.

38:42.625 --> 38:47.875
WELL, YOU CAN EITHER
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE,

38:47.875 --> 38:49.917
WHOLEHEARTEDLY,

38:49.917 --> 38:54.250
OR YOU CAN GO BACK
TO MR. DRAKE AND WRITE
HIM A VERY LARGE CHECK

38:54.250 --> 38:57.375
AND MAKE THIS MARRIAGE
ANOTHER STATISTIC.

38:58.625 --> 39:03.667
EITHER ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS
SOUND APPEALING, MITCH?

39:03.667 --> 39:05.000
YES.

39:07.458 --> 39:10.166
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHICH ONE YET.

39:24.333 --> 39:27.834
I WAS HOPING
YOU MIGHT BE HERE.

39:30.083 --> 39:32.208
THIS IS BEGINNING TO SOUND
LIKE A RIDICULOUS REFRAIN,

39:32.208 --> 39:35.708
BUT, JOEY, YOU HAVE TO KNOW

39:35.708 --> 39:37.000
THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY OF
THOSE FEELINGS LEFT FOR JEN,
I SWEAR TO YOU--

39:37.000 --> 39:39.583
DAWSON, IT'S OK.

39:40.792 --> 39:41.959
IT IS?

39:41.959 --> 39:43.500
YES.

39:45.375 --> 39:47.583
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T GO TO FRANCE,
DAWSON?

39:49.875 --> 39:52.625
BECAUSE I WANTED
YOU SO BADLY.

39:56.458 --> 40:01.417
I MEAN, FRANCE, I COULD
HAVE STARTED OVER.

40:01.417 --> 40:04.083
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T
BE JOEY THE WAITRESS

40:04.083 --> 40:05.917
OR JOEY THE DAUGHTER
OF A CONVICT,

40:05.917 --> 40:11.250
OR JOEY, HALF OF THE
"WILL THEY, WON'T THEY"
COUPLE OF THE CENTURY.

40:11.250 --> 40:14.000
I DIDN'T GO
TO FRANCE BECAUSE

40:14.000 --> 40:16.542
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
THE EASY WAY OUT,
YOU KNOW,

40:16.542 --> 40:18.875
THE EASIEST ESCAPE
FROM MY LIFE,

40:18.875 --> 40:21.000
WHICH, IN SPITE
OF A FEW HIGHLIGHTS,

40:21.000 --> 40:22.834
IS PRETTY PATHETIC.

40:22.834 --> 40:25.500
BUT I DIDN'T
WANT TO TAKE THAT
EASY WAY OUT, DAWSON.

40:25.500 --> 40:28.208
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
STICKING AROUND HERE

40:28.208 --> 40:30.208
WOULD ONLY
MAKE ME STRONGER.

40:30.208 --> 40:33.250
AND THERE WAS YOU, TOO.

40:33.250 --> 40:35.166
DAWSON LEERY,

40:35.166 --> 40:36.750
WHO FINALLY GOT A CLUE.

40:39.708 --> 40:41.708
BUT I HAVE TO
TELL YOU, DAWSON,

40:41.708 --> 40:43.667
AS COMPLICATED AS
OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS,

40:43.667 --> 40:45.500
IT DOESN'T EVEN COMPARE
TO HOW COMPLICATED

40:45.500 --> 40:47.917
WHATEVER YOU AND I HAVE
HERE IS BOUND TO BE.

40:47.917 --> 40:49.750
I DON'T KNOW.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.125
YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:53.917 --> 40:56.917
WHAT YOU AND I HAVE
MAY NEVER BE SIMPLE,

40:56.917 --> 41:00.875
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE SCORCHING.

41:04.417 --> 41:05.458
BESIDES, WHO'S TO
SAY THAT YOU CAN'T
HAVE SOME OF FRANCE

41:05.458 --> 41:07.792
RIGHT HERE
IN CAPESIDE, HUH?

41:07.792 --> 41:10.333
HERE WE ARE
ALONG THE RIVER SEINE,

41:10.333 --> 41:11.542
A TOUR OF
THE ISLE DE LA CITé,

41:11.542 --> 41:15.458
THE FAVORITE SPOT
OF LOVERS AND FRIENDS,

41:15.458 --> 41:17.458
AND...

41:17.458 --> 41:21.500
FROM HERE,
WE ALSO HAVE A VIEW
THE MAGNIFICENT STRUCTURE

41:21.500 --> 41:24.041
THAT WE SIMPLISTS
HERE IN CAPESIDE
LIKE TO CALL...

41:24.041 --> 41:26.959
ZE SWING SET.

41:28.959 --> 41:30.417
GRANTED,
IT'S NO EIFFEL TOWER,

41:30.417 --> 41:33.625
BUT IT'S ALL WE GOT.

41:33.625 --> 41:37.500
BUT DON'T FORGET ABOUT
THE OTHER FRANCOPHILE
OPPORTUNITIES IN TOWN...

41:38.250 --> 41:40.291
FRENCH FRIES...

41:40.291 --> 41:43.667
FRENCH TOAST...

41:43.667 --> 41:44.792
FRENCH DOORS...

42:18.500 --> 42:20.083
FRENCH KISS.

42:22.875 --> 42:25.291
THE SECOND KISS,

42:25.291 --> 42:27.875
THE RATIONAL ONE,

42:27.875 --> 42:30.208
THE ONE THAT
REQUIRED THOUGHT.

42:34.542 --> 42:39.166
YOU KNOW, I FOUND OUT
WHAT THEY'RE REPLACING
THE RIALTO WITH--

42:39.166 --> 42:41.250
ANOTHER MOVIE THEATER.

42:42.583 --> 42:45.083
THEY'RE REPLACING ONE
THEATER WITH ANOTHER?

42:45.083 --> 42:46.417
YEAH, THEY'RE UPGRADING.

42:46.417 --> 42:50.041
BIGGER SEATS, BIGGER SCREEN,
BETTER SOUND.

42:50.041 --> 42:52.083
THEY SAY IT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE GREAT.

42:52.083 --> 42:53.500
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

42:53.500 --> 42:54.708
THEY HAVE TO
CHANGE SOMETHING
IF IT ALREADY WORKS.

42:54.708 --> 42:58.166
BECAUSE MAYBE IT'LL
WORK EVEN BETTER.

43:03.291 --> 43:05.542
IT'S GONNA
BE SO SIMPLE, JO.

43:06.875 --> 43:10.792
YOU KNOW, ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT A SECOND KISS?

43:10.792 --> 43:11.917
YEAH?

43:11.917 --> 43:15.166
HAS KINDA PUT ME
IN THE MOOD FOR A THIRD.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.750
ME, TOO.

43:19.041 --> 43:20.917
I TOLD YOU IT
WAS GONNA BE SIMPLE.
