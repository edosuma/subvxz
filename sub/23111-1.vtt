Morning.

02:38.208 --> 02:39.208
Ward.

02:40.666 --> 02:42.541
Red sauce? Green sauce?

02:53.625 --> 02:54.500
Babe, you up?

02:55.458 --> 02:57.250
It's after noon, you gotta get up.

02:57.791 --> 02:59.458
I made some coffee, come on.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.083
There he is.

03:06.458 --> 03:09.083
-Morning.
-Afternoon.

03:11.958 --> 03:12.958
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:13.041 --> 03:13.875
Hi.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.375
- Coffee.
- I know.

03:16.458 --> 03:17.583
What the hell's this in my--

03:17.666 --> 03:19.250
-What's that shit in there?
-What?

03:23.458 --> 03:24.625
-Whoops.
-Yeah.

03:24.708 --> 03:26.625
Ran out of coffee filters,
had to use a napkin.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.875
-It'll be fine.
-I'll just chew that up next time.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.166
Oh, come on.

03:31.250 --> 03:33.750
Why is the Fairy in the bird feeder again?

03:33.833 --> 03:36.125
-I-- I thought--
-You told me that you killed it.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.875
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you.
All right?

03:38.958 --> 03:40.500
-Please.
-I don't fuck with no Fairies.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.000
You need to fuck with that one.

03:42.083 --> 03:45.916
When I was little, my cousin DayDay
was throwing rocks at this Fairy.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.291
-The Fairy shit in his own hand...
-Uh-huh.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.250
...threw the shit,
and it went in DayDay's eye,

03:50.333 --> 03:52.000
and it was like a fucking cantaloupe.

03:52.083 --> 03:54.125
-Bullshit story.
-No, he almost lost his eye.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.291
-I'm telling you. Listen--
-That's not true.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.041
$200. Pay the man.
Same man that does the bees.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.583
No, I'm not paying $200.

04:00.666 --> 04:03.750
I got this big, handsome, strapping man
standing right in front of me.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.666
Go kill that Fairy, please.
Thank you so much.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.500
I'll kill the Fairy.
Let me finish my coffee.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.166
-I'mma kill the Fairy. All right?
-Okay.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.250
That may kill you. You should do it
before you finish the coffee.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.333
-How was work?
-Eh, work. Work is good, you know?

04:15.416 --> 04:18.458
Just, a lot of stab wounds lately.
There's, uh...

04:18.541 --> 04:21.791
We had this homeless guy come in,
throwing equipment everywhere.

04:21.875 --> 04:22.958
It was wild.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.583
A lot of traffic accidents,

04:24.666 --> 04:27.875
- and this older guy, he coded out on me.
- What about that cop that's an Orc

04:27.958 --> 04:30.291
that's now on the LAPD force?

04:30.708 --> 04:33.041
- How does that work?
- He's not blooded.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.166
He's not part of any blooded clan.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.416
He's like a finger
that got cut off the hand.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.791
He's dead to us.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.708
This is shock trauma at its finest.

04:42.791 --> 04:45.083
...and then you see the humans
and the Elves...

04:49.250 --> 04:50.875
I don't want this guy in my car either.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.166
Baby, I don't want you to get shot again.

04:55.666 --> 04:58.125
Five years, I'm gonna retire.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.791
But... I can't fuck up my pension.

05:03.791 --> 05:07.708
All right? I mean,
that's my fucking worst nightmare.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.916
You know what my worst nightmare is?

05:10.708 --> 05:12.791
It's them wheeling you in
when I'm at work.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.750
That's my nightmare.

05:17.958 --> 05:19.541
Come on. Come here.

05:20.791 --> 05:23.250
Fairy. Now.

05:36.833 --> 05:40.000
Hey, y'all, I want y'all to trip off
my police-ass neighbor. He's a trip.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.750
-Good afternoon, Officer.
-Hey. What up, Mike?

05:45.041 --> 05:47.791
Yo, that Fairy been all up in my crib,

05:47.875 --> 05:49.708
eating up my dog food and shit.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.458
I'm about to call the city, man.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.375
I am the city.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.750
All right? You save your dime.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.291
Fairy lives don't matter today.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.458
Check this out, y'all.
This is probably gonna be good.

06:03.125 --> 06:05.375
It's on now!

06:07.791 --> 06:10.041
Ring the bell, y'all.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.958
Oh!

06:14.375 --> 06:16.250
Damn. Look at this nigga, man.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.416
Oh, that's it right there.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.666
Oh, you got it now. Take the homie out
LAPD-style like you do.

06:22.833 --> 06:23.750
Oh!

06:23.833 --> 06:26.250
You ain't gotta do him like that. Damn!

06:26.416 --> 06:27.625
That was nasty.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.291
- Man.
- Come on, G.

06:29.416 --> 06:31.166
- It's what I do.
- Oh, shit.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.541
Oh, and, uh, you keep doing
all your gangsta stuff.

06:33.625 --> 06:36.416
I'm just trying to sell my house.
Don't worry about that.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.958
Thanks for the show, Officer.

06:38.541 --> 06:42.000
He's a trip. That motherfucker's crazy.
Got a fine-ass wife, too.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.291
Are you in trouble?

06:45.666 --> 06:47.791
Am I in trouble?
What your mother say to you?

06:48.250 --> 06:51.083
Mom said that Nick got you in trouble
because Orcs are dumb.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.875
That's not true, all right?
Orcs are not dumb.

06:54.458 --> 06:58.375
Just, uh-- All of the races
are-are different. Okay?

06:58.458 --> 07:02.416
And just 'cause they're different
doesn't mean anybody's smarter

07:02.500 --> 07:04.208
or dumber, you know,

07:04.291 --> 07:06.458
better or worse than anybody.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.375
All right? It's just-just...

07:08.916 --> 07:11.833
You know, everybody's just trying
to get along and-and...

07:12.416 --> 07:13.625
have a good life.

07:15.916 --> 07:16.875
What the hell?

07:16.958 --> 07:19.458
Hey, baby, you gotta take some clothes.
Get some clothes.

07:19.541 --> 07:20.416
Fine.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.625
Hey, hey!

07:22.791 --> 07:23.875
Hey, partner.

07:24.375 --> 07:26.708
Ready to get back to work? All healed up?

07:26.791 --> 07:28.708
What the hell are you doing at my house?

07:29.083 --> 07:30.958
Why are you at my house?
Why are you on my lawn?

07:31.041 --> 07:32.291
Your lawn's dead, Ward.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.125
Exactly. Which is why I seeded it

07:34.208 --> 07:36.250
and spread cow shit everywhere
so it grows back.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.583
That's not really cow shit.

07:37.666 --> 07:41.000
-What do you mean it's not cow shit?
-It's sewage, from toilets.

07:41.458 --> 07:43.250
From the treatment plant, swear to God.

07:43.625 --> 07:44.875
I paid $400 for this.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.750
-That's bullshit.
-Human shit.

07:47.416 --> 07:50.125
-Why do you think I compost?
-Whatever. Whatever. Whatever.

07:50.208 --> 07:53.333
You don't ever come here in that
ever again.

07:53.416 --> 07:57.208
I was at diversity training. Your house
is on the way to the bar. I thought--

07:57.291 --> 08:00.166
-Hi, Nick.
-Hey, Sophia. What's up, rock star?

08:00.250 --> 08:01.500
We're gonna go to Grandma's.

08:01.583 --> 08:04.166
-Grandma's? Hop in, we'll give you a ride.
-Shut up.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.291
-This ain't no Uber, man.
-Don't tell Nick to shut up.

08:07.375 --> 08:08.750
He's a person, too.

08:08.833 --> 08:10.000
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.208
That's an enlightened kid you got there,
Daryl.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.625
Don't worry about me.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.708
Just Crip-walk your asses
on back to the barbecue.

08:20.791 --> 08:21.958
Be nice to give you a ride...

08:22.041 --> 08:23.958
-Shut up.
-...on your first day back.

Uh...

All right, baby. What's up?

09:05.250 --> 09:07.125
What's happening? What's up?
Why you sad?

09:08.083 --> 09:08.958
What happened?

09:10.083 --> 09:11.458
I don't want you to die.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.833
I'm not gonna die. What are you--

09:14.916 --> 09:18.250
-What you talking about?
-Mama said Nick's gonna get you killed.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.291
I don't know why she said...

09:22.708 --> 09:24.500
Nick is not gonna get me killed,
all right?

09:25.833 --> 09:27.833
Why do you have to be a policeman?

09:28.416 --> 09:30.208
Everybody hates policemen.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.250
Hey...

09:51.375 --> 09:53.166
Know what?
You smell like you haven't slept.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.750
I have melatonin in my war bag.
You take one before bed,

09:56.833 --> 10:00.458
-turn off the laptop, get--
-Maybe I'm having trouble sleeping

10:00.541 --> 10:02.000
because of the nightmares I'm having

10:02.083 --> 10:05.500
from being blasted across the street
with a shotgun

10:05.583 --> 10:07.458
while your ass was getting a burrito.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.541
But I was getting a burrito for you.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.541
-Yeah--
-I don't eat cow flesh.

10:11.625 --> 10:14.125
Do you think that you could get a burrito

10:15.000 --> 10:16.125
and do your job?

10:16.625 --> 10:18.875
You think you could get a burrito
and watch my back

10:18.958 --> 10:21.541
-like every other cop manages to do?
-Yes.

10:23.583 --> 10:26.875
Look, I know... you're disappointed in me.

10:26.958 --> 10:29.791
I know that you think that I let you down.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.541
-Yeah. You know what?
-But I--

10:31.625 --> 10:33.791
You know what? It's a new day.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.916
Back to work. We hitting the reset button.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.791
Copy that. Copy that.
We're hitting the reset button.

10:40.958 --> 10:42.500
Moving forward together.

10:42.958 --> 10:44.541
As friends, together.

10:48.916 --> 10:51.541
We will not be listening
to no Orkish music.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.875
That is one of the greatest love songs
ever written.

10:55.958 --> 10:58.750
That's a love song in prison.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.083
I believe that you're lacking in love,
Ward.

11:03.291 --> 11:05.208
-I'm what?
-By love, I mean...

11:06.458 --> 11:10.541
like... physical love.

11:11.833 --> 11:13.375
Yeah. Um...

11:13.458 --> 11:14.416
Right?

11:15.000 --> 11:19.208
I'm straight. I don't need
no physical love. Trust me, I'm good.

11:19.541 --> 11:20.750
You can't hide it, Ward.

11:21.416 --> 11:23.291
Humans have physical tells.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.458
-Tells, huh?
-Yeah.

11:26.708 --> 11:28.916
-It's called a face.
-I ain't making no face.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.125
-Like the face you're making right now.
-I ain't making no face.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.250
All right.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.166
What face am I making?

11:35.250 --> 11:39.083
"A human who needs a lot more
conjugal love" type face.

11:41.291 --> 11:44.125
"Conjugal love" face.
So you know human face--

11:44.208 --> 11:45.541
Show me another human face.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.291
-What's another one we make?
-Oh, uh...

11:50.041 --> 11:54.041
-What's that face?
-Human who doesn't get anymore pancakes.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.750
-We do like our pancakes, for real.
-I got a lot of 'em.

11:58.833 --> 12:00.333
-You got a lot?
-I got a lot of them.

12:00.416 --> 12:04.833
Show me the face an Orc makes
when he just shut the fuck up,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.250
and don't say shit,
and just drive to work.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.708
Yeah, that's it! That's it!
Oh, you got that one!

12:13.791 --> 12:16.625
Yeah, you killing that one.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.625
You should do that one.
Do that one, like, all the time.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Whoa. Whoa. Why you going this way?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.166
It's fine, it's a shortcut.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.583
See? They're very nice here.

12:33.666 --> 12:36.083
Dude, you can't go through Elftown.

12:36.291 --> 12:39.375
You are killing me. Killing me, dude.

12:41.166 --> 12:44.541
So, what, you trying to...
get yourself some designer shoes?

12:44.875 --> 12:47.708
Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass Elves

12:47.791 --> 12:50.125
just running the world and shopping.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.000
I hate Elftown.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.583
Even the chauffeurs are snobs.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.166
♪ I'm running for the crown ♪

13:24.375 --> 13:27.041
♪ Running for the crown ♪

13:27.750 --> 13:30.041
♪ So heavy on my, heavy on my bones ♪

13:30.166 --> 13:32.666
♪ When I'm sittin' on my
Sittin' on my throne ♪

13:32.750 --> 13:34.000
♪ I'm running for the ♪

13:38.166 --> 13:39.916
Hey. Back already, Ward?

13:40.583 --> 13:42.791
Where's the, uh,
diversity hire you ride with?

13:42.875 --> 13:46.125
Yeah, what kind of partner is Jakoby?
Is he your dance partner?

13:46.333 --> 13:47.375
Your sexual partner?

13:47.458 --> 13:49.500
'Cause he fucking sucks
at catching bad guys.

13:50.583 --> 13:52.250
That's Clan Law shit, dog.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.291
Orcs got each other's backs.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.333
Hey, look, why y'all acting like
I put this dude in my car?

13:57.416 --> 14:00.250
So what are you doing to get him
the fuck out of this division?

14:00.333 --> 14:02.833
Hey, long as he pull his weight,
I ain't got no beef with him.

14:02.916 --> 14:04.416
No. No, no, no. You could do shit, man.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.541
You could write a letter.
His ass would be gone if we back you up.

14:07.666 --> 14:08.833
That's a fact.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.166
-But you only care about yourself, Ward.
-Right.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.541
Did I... Did I ask you for advice?

14:13.916 --> 14:17.833
'Cause I'll probably wait till I'm on my,
like, ninth divorce,

14:17.958 --> 14:19.875
then your advice
will come in really handy.

14:19.958 --> 14:22.541
That's good. That's fucking good. Noted.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.583
Meanwhile, that Orc fuck
is still out there

14:24.666 --> 14:26.833
because Jakoby chose clan blood
over the badge.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.708
Or the motherfucker just got away.

14:28.791 --> 14:30.416
He got away 'cause Jakoby let him.

14:31.375 --> 14:32.458
What happens next?

14:32.791 --> 14:35.666
What happens the next time
this pig motherfucker

14:35.750 --> 14:38.125
makes a cop suck-start
his fucking 12-gauge?

14:38.208 --> 14:40.000
Only this time, it's Brown,

14:40.083 --> 14:42.166
or it's Hicks, or it's fucking me.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.416
How you gonna feel, Ward?
'Cause that shit is on you.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.125
Well, if you in the box,
I'll probably be like...

14:49.333 --> 14:52.000
Ward, you son of a bitch.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.708
Hey, look, I got a dude in my car,

14:54.791 --> 14:56.958
the whole world is watching, all right?

14:57.041 --> 15:00.500
I didn't ask for it, I don't want it,
but I don't get a vote.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.083
And what happens if they hire more?
You know what they say.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.166
Once with the Dark Lord,
always with the Dark Lord.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.541
They chose evil.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.708
Here's the thing I can't understand.

15:09.041 --> 15:13.083
How do a bunch of dudes who can barely
remember their baby mama's birthday

15:13.166 --> 15:15.291
have beef with a whole race

15:15.375 --> 15:17.833
over some shit that happened
2,000 years ago?

15:17.916 --> 15:19.125
Here's the fucking deal, man.

15:19.208 --> 15:21.875
You keep Jakoby
the fuck away from me. Okay?

15:21.958 --> 15:23.833
I'll drop an Orc. I don't give a fuck.

15:23.916 --> 15:27.083
My ancestors killed them
by the fucking thousands in Russia.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.000
- Attaboy, Ward!
- About time, Ward.

15:34.250 --> 15:37.416
All right, settle down,
settle down. The captain's coming.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.541
Ward, I saved you a seat.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.125
Take it away, boss.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.708
Ward, nice to see you back.

15:44.791 --> 15:45.750
Cap.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.750
- Tonight's the trifecta.
- Hey, is that your cousin?

15:48.833 --> 15:50.250
Full moon, Friday night...

15:50.333 --> 15:52.083
-No.
-...summer heat wave.

15:52.166 --> 15:55.250
That means: clear your calls fast,

15:55.333 --> 15:57.000
help your colleagues clear theirs,

15:57.083 --> 16:00.125
get me out of this deployment period
without another murder,

16:00.208 --> 16:01.333
I'll buy you all coffee.

16:01.416 --> 16:02.958
Sergeant Ching, all yours.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.875
All right, after I call your name,
get your shotguns and radios and deploy.

16:06.958 --> 16:10.541
I don't want to see you here
unless there's bad guys under the desks.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.166
Three-Mary-25, Pollard.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.000
Three-Mary-55, Kim.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.041
Three-Mary-60, Thomas.

16:17.458 --> 16:19.833
Three-A-21, Pippen and Gosser.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.750
Three-A-54, Hancock and Wheeler.

16:22.833 --> 16:25.041
Three-A-80, Crawford and Duncan.

16:25.458 --> 16:28.333
Three-A-9, Jakoby and Ward.

16:28.416 --> 16:31.250
-Three-A-34, Jones and Morengo.
-Hey, uh, hit the kit room.

16:31.333 --> 16:34.125
-Three-A-82, Ortiz and Mencia...
-I'll meet you at the gas pumps.

16:34.208 --> 16:36.333
-I'll be right down. I just need to--
-Okay.

16:37.791 --> 16:39.083
Three-A-99...

16:40.291 --> 16:42.583
-No.
-Yes. Put him in another car.

16:42.666 --> 16:45.583
What the fuck about my demeanor
gives you the impression

16:45.666 --> 16:49.041
that I want to be a target
on the department's Orc-diversity radar?

16:49.625 --> 16:52.541
These decisions are made
nine miles above me.

16:53.416 --> 16:56.666
No. They're made right on your paper,
right there.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.708
Scratch him out.

16:57.791 --> 17:00.208
Scratch his name out.
Put another name, anybody.

17:00.291 --> 17:03.000
Ward, no one wants to ride with you.

17:04.916 --> 17:07.375
Goodbye. Don't get shot again.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.416
Good luck.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.750
- Hey, looking good, bud.
- Looking real good. Real good.

17:27.083 --> 17:28.291
Be safe, guys.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.125
What's up, homies?

17:49.166 --> 17:50.875
Your ass still alive?

17:51.458 --> 17:52.958
You know something about that?

17:53.041 --> 17:54.416
It wasn't me.

17:56.958 --> 17:59.083
Get the fuck off of the street
or I'mma call your PO,

17:59.166 --> 18:01.000
tell him you out drinking
with the homies.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.458
I ain't gonna tell you two times.

18:05.833 --> 18:06.791
Let's go.

18:27.583 --> 18:30.666
I need to know if the shit pop off
with these Fogteeth fools

18:30.750 --> 18:33.083
that you got my back,
that you a cop first.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.291
Are we clear?

18:34.791 --> 18:35.625
Clear.

18:35.708 --> 18:39.500
I'm about dope, money, and guns.
That's my job.

18:39.875 --> 18:42.250
Your job is to make sure
I go home at night.

18:42.333 --> 18:45.083
-I don't like this small talk.
-This ain't no small talk.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.625
This is big-ass talk.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.000
We doing real shit out here.

18:49.083 --> 18:51.708
All Westlake units,
three-A-4 is requesting assistance.

18:51.791 --> 18:54.166
Sixth and Whitmore. Sixth and Whitmore.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.541
All Westlake units, Three-A-4...

19:04.000 --> 19:05.916
Get him the fuck on the ground!

19:06.500 --> 19:07.625
Back the fuck up!

19:07.708 --> 19:10.541
Stay there! Stay right fucking there!

19:10.958 --> 19:14.041
- Do not resist! Don't--
- Shut the fuck up!

19:14.125 --> 19:16.166
I need to know if you're a cop first...

19:16.750 --> 19:18.333
or an Orc first.

19:18.708 --> 19:20.750
-I need to hear you say it.
-Ward, I...

19:21.208 --> 19:24.833
I wanted to be a cop
since I was a little kid.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.083
I am nothing else.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.541
My badge means more to me
than the air I breathe.

19:32.916 --> 19:34.208
So don't question me.

19:41.416 --> 19:44.083
Three-A-9, 415. Fifth and Westlake.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.166
Code two, incident 2415.

19:46.666 --> 19:48.750
Three-Adam-9. Roger, show us en route.

19:49.375 --> 19:50.625
Three-A-9, roger.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.666
The fuck outta here.

19:52.750 --> 19:56.416
God damn it!

20:02.125 --> 20:05.208
Rodriguez. Hey.

20:05.291 --> 20:09.000
Oh, shit, man. I thought you were dead.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.000
Nah, man, too many bills to pay.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.250
I hear ya.

20:12.333 --> 20:15.000
I thought you were out
having your, like, zillionth baby.

20:15.083 --> 20:18.791
Ah, nah, man. Marisol's a week late.
We're inducing next week, though.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.875
Number five.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.708
-Five.
-Lot of mouths to feed.

20:22.791 --> 20:23.666
Yeah, man.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.666
Sir...

20:26.083 --> 20:27.875
drop the sword.

20:28.458 --> 20:29.291
You.

20:31.708 --> 20:34.541
The Army of Nine Races
fought shoulder to shoulder

20:34.625 --> 20:37.000
to give you the world you neglect.

20:37.083 --> 20:39.125
- Hey, tell him to shut up.
- 2,000 years ago,

20:39.208 --> 20:41.291
-we fought them with swords and arrows.
-Sir--

20:41.375 --> 20:46.708
And now, the Dark One returns
to reclaim Orc hearts!

20:47.208 --> 20:50.625
Everywhere I go, why have Orcs
always gotta be the bad guys?

20:50.708 --> 20:53.541
Hey, don't look at me, man.
Mexicans still get shit for the Alamo.

20:53.625 --> 20:56.791
Get back! Get back!

20:58.375 --> 21:02.500
Sir, unless you wanna die,
you drop that sword right fucking now!

21:05.750 --> 21:08.375
Hey, you got me shot,
don't get me stabbed.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.250
Turn around, sir.

21:12.083 --> 21:15.083
-Hands on your head.
-I'm doing it, man. Jeez.

21:15.291 --> 21:17.791
-On your knees.
-I-- All right.

21:18.958 --> 21:21.291
Don't move.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.500
Having a little fun.

21:23.875 --> 21:25.416
Aah! Shit!

21:26.416 --> 21:27.875
All right. Damn.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.083
I'm not resisting, man.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.916
Three-Adam-9, one in custody.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.375
All units, code four.
Fifth and Westlake, suspect in custody.

21:42.291 --> 21:45.250
Okay, man, easy. Gimme a-- Gimme a-- Ow!

21:49.666 --> 21:50.541
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:50.625 --> 21:51.458
Real quick.

21:51.958 --> 21:54.791
Gang intel said Fogteeth's been smashing
like a motherfucker,

21:54.875 --> 21:57.875
and Altamira's gangbanging like it's 1999.

21:57.958 --> 21:59.833
-Watch your backs out there.
-Hey, you too.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.916
-All right, brother.
-Kiss your family.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.041
Sir, can you sit back?

22:12.708 --> 22:15.083
You-You stink like shit. Can you sit back?

22:15.333 --> 22:16.208
Thank you.

22:22.583 --> 22:23.416
Come on.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.208
That's bad.

22:30.791 --> 22:32.875
I have a message
from the Shield of Light.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.041
Remember the old ways.

22:35.458 --> 22:37.000
Remember what you are.

22:37.083 --> 22:38.541
Is that Orkish?

22:41.208 --> 22:43.375
How the hell do you know
how to speak Orkish?

22:44.875 --> 22:45.833
What'd he say?

22:47.750 --> 22:49.750
Remember your traditions.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.541
Only clan ways can save you.

22:52.833 --> 22:56.166
The Prophecy has chosen you.

22:57.041 --> 22:59.625
The man with you is blessed.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.666
Jakoby!

23:05.375 --> 23:06.666
Come on, man.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.250
What the hell is your problem?
What'd he say?

23:10.041 --> 23:11.583
He's not making any sense.

23:31.708 --> 23:32.833
Where's Jakoby?

23:33.125 --> 23:35.083
Uh, booking our body, ma'am.

23:35.583 --> 23:37.333
Um, I love your hair.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.083
Who are you?

23:40.166 --> 23:43.625
I'm the unemployment line,
or a prison sentence.

23:44.208 --> 23:47.333
I could be the Angel of Mercy,
but it's up to you, buddy.

23:47.500 --> 23:48.375
Ah.

23:49.291 --> 23:50.500
Internal Affairs.

23:50.583 --> 23:54.291
That's right, all fucking day long.
Now, let's review, kids.

23:54.375 --> 23:58.625
Some pigskin piece of shit puts a load
of buckshot into your trauma plate.

23:58.708 --> 24:01.000
-Shithead foot-bails, Jakoby pursues...
-Hey!

24:01.583 --> 24:03.541
Hey!

24:04.166 --> 24:05.416
Police! Stop!

24:05.750 --> 24:08.208
...corners his asshole in, what,
a dead-end alley?

24:09.000 --> 24:11.916
Jakoby states dude tackled
and disarmed him.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.125
Then jumped on a fire escape ladder
and evaded arrest.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.208
Jakoby's signed statement.

24:18.291 --> 24:20.416
Ladder's 13 feet off the ground.
We measured.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.833
- Mm-hmm.
- No Orc has a six-foot vertical.

24:22.916 --> 24:25.583
Perhaps the suspect
was light on his feet, sir.

24:25.916 --> 24:28.083
Do Orcs have, uh, mad hops?

24:28.416 --> 24:29.708
How many Orcs are ballers?

24:30.125 --> 24:32.000
-Excuse me?
-You fuckin' heard the detective.

24:32.083 --> 24:34.416
-How many Orcs play pro basketball?
-None.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.958
They're slow, they're heavy.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.333
That's why half the NFL
defensive lines are Orkish.

24:38.416 --> 24:39.708
It's not racism, it's physics.

24:39.791 --> 24:42.458
Jakoby kicked loose that pigskin fuck
who blasted you.

24:42.833 --> 24:43.750
Do the math.

24:43.833 --> 24:46.750
Orcs hold Clan Law above all else.
That's a fact.

24:50.625 --> 24:53.541
The Jakoby issue is sensitive.
The world's watching.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.416
- We can't fire him without cause.
- Which is why...

24:57.416 --> 24:59.083
you're gonna get him to admit it...

25:00.000 --> 25:01.500
and you're gonna record him.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.750
The fuck outta here.

25:06.416 --> 25:08.708
I want the guy out of my car, but...

25:09.166 --> 25:11.333
I snitch, I'm done as a street cop.

25:11.916 --> 25:15.375
We know, uh, you got a house note
you can't pay down.

25:16.125 --> 25:18.041
Right? Drowning in debt.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.208
Raising a little girl
you can't afford to pay for.

25:21.625 --> 25:22.583
Mmm.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.083
Father of the fucking year.

25:28.625 --> 25:32.083
You talk about my family again,
I'll split your fucking head open.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.000
Ward.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.083
You need this job.

25:36.958 --> 25:38.333
Don't throw it away for Jakoby.

25:39.291 --> 25:41.291
Get off me. Get off me.

25:49.750 --> 25:50.666
Give it to me.

25:55.125 --> 25:56.458
No testifying...

25:57.500 --> 25:59.000
no depositions,

25:59.083 --> 26:00.291
no paperwork.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.250
Good man.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.000
Very smart.

26:08.041 --> 26:10.000
Shave your mustache, bitch.

26:14.375 --> 26:15.625
It's just business.

26:28.875 --> 26:30.208
Place is a shithole.

26:34.916 --> 26:36.625
An Orc with a badge.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.416
Incredible.

26:38.500 --> 26:42.250
That's some shit you don't see every day.
Like an Elf with a mop.

26:43.375 --> 26:45.000
Did you see those two guys?

26:45.291 --> 26:48.125
I think they're feds.
Could they be here for me?

26:48.916 --> 26:51.875
Feds don't give a shit
about the LA Orc community.

26:52.208 --> 26:53.333
Yeah, you're right.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.250
S... So, my-my daughter...

27:18.000 --> 27:19.041
um...

27:19.333 --> 27:20.333
Sophia...

27:21.166 --> 27:25.500
she be doing shit all the time, man,
that she don't have no business doing.

27:25.750 --> 27:26.666
Um...

27:27.791 --> 27:30.791
But... she comes clean.

27:32.166 --> 27:33.625
She always tells the truth.

27:34.916 --> 27:37.541
'Cause she realized it feels good.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.541
Feels good to her, feels good to me.

27:41.875 --> 27:44.208
And, uh, truth just has a way...

27:45.125 --> 27:47.750
of clearing the air between people.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.458
If it cleanses--
cleanses some shit, you know,

27:51.541 --> 27:53.500
it's like, just tell the truth.

27:53.583 --> 27:56.708
I know something very bad happened
at the station.

27:58.000 --> 27:58.833
I know.

28:00.708 --> 28:02.666
So are you gonna tell me about it or no?

28:02.750 --> 28:04.041
I'm talking about you. All right?

28:04.125 --> 28:06.416
Don't be trying to twist this.
Nothing happened at the--

28:06.500 --> 28:08.375
- I'm not--
- ...trouble, 341 Abrams.

28:08.458 --> 28:10.583
Code two, incident 2815.

28:12.916 --> 28:14.708
Three-Adam-9, show us en route.

28:15.333 --> 28:18.041
341 Abrams.

28:18.125 --> 28:19.458
Three-A-9, roger.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.291
How long you been in Shield of Light?

28:28.083 --> 28:28.916
What's that?

28:29.625 --> 28:31.208
God!

28:31.833 --> 28:32.916
You little fuck-up.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.875
Aah! Shit! What are you doing, man?

28:36.958 --> 28:38.666
No questions, just shut up.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.416
Hey, nice Shield of Light tattoo!

28:42.583 --> 28:44.625
-Good one.
-You know who we are?

28:44.791 --> 28:46.791
Housekeeping.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.708
You might wanna look at this.

28:50.083 --> 28:52.083
Fuck. Magic Task Force.

28:52.166 --> 28:55.458
Right. The magic feds.

28:55.791 --> 28:59.958
You know, Serling,
if you're gonna play stupid games,

29:00.541 --> 29:02.416
you're gonna win stupid prizes.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.333
Fuck you.

29:03.666 --> 29:04.916
You wanna test me, asshole?

29:05.000 --> 29:06.583
Okay! I'm not your enemy, man.

29:09.333 --> 29:11.166
What do you know about the Inferni?

29:12.458 --> 29:14.750
Um... they're Elves.

29:14.958 --> 29:16.375
Renegade Elves.

29:17.458 --> 29:19.125
Renegade Elves, sorry.

29:20.333 --> 29:23.083
Because Elves are awesome, right?

29:24.291 --> 29:26.500
They're gonna bring back the Dark Lord.

29:27.083 --> 29:28.833
Fairy fucking tales.

29:30.083 --> 29:31.583
How do they plan to do that?

29:32.166 --> 29:35.500
When they get three Magic Wands,
they can raise him from the dead.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.583
You recognize her?

29:40.375 --> 29:41.416
That's Leilah.

29:42.958 --> 29:45.000
She's an Inferni coven leader.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.666
She's a Bright.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.791
You ever notice how
most Brights are Elves,

29:53.291 --> 29:55.083
and Elves run the world?

29:56.166 --> 29:57.250
Coincidence?

29:57.583 --> 29:59.333
There are human Brights.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.250
One in a million.

30:03.500 --> 30:06.250
But you know how you know
if you're a Bright?

30:08.500 --> 30:10.083
When you touch a Wand...

30:10.708 --> 30:12.291
with your bare hand...

30:14.875 --> 30:16.291
and don't explode.

30:17.583 --> 30:18.708
Would you do that?

30:19.666 --> 30:22.708
Would you die to learn the truth
about yourself?

30:24.125 --> 30:26.750
If I had a Wand... I'd try.

30:26.833 --> 30:28.208
Let's get back on track.

30:28.541 --> 30:32.125
So Leilah has a Magic Wand,
and she's coming after Tikka, right?

30:32.875 --> 30:34.916
And she'll shred this city to do it.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.833
We get Tikka,
we can set a trap for Leilah.

30:38.916 --> 30:40.625
We hunt Wands, we hunt Brights.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.916
That's what we do,
and we're pretty fucking good at it.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.208
You wanna help us?

30:45.541 --> 30:46.375
Come on.

30:47.708 --> 30:49.500
The Dark Lord's coming.

30:53.833 --> 30:56.333
What, are you gonna to fight him with,
with tanks?

30:57.041 --> 30:59.166
Huh? You gonna drone him?

31:01.833 --> 31:05.625
Two thousand years ago, magic stopped him.

31:06.500 --> 31:09.083
And magic will stop him again.

31:10.583 --> 31:14.458
One day, you all are gonna come begging
for our help.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.625
And we'll be there. We'll stop him.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.083
The Shield of Light will stop him.

31:21.875 --> 31:22.750
I'm done.

31:24.916 --> 31:25.833
We're done.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.458
If you act like my enemy...

31:31.625 --> 31:33.000
you become my enemy.

31:42.458 --> 31:43.375
See that?

31:44.166 --> 31:46.291
- Oh, it's a spotter.
- Mm-hmm.

32:05.333 --> 32:06.666
Get down! Down! Go!

32:09.083 --> 32:12.625
Oh. Yeah, that's-- That's not good.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.041
-Yeah.
-We could die.

32:16.791 --> 32:18.750
-First time being shot at?
-Yeah.

32:18.916 --> 32:21.291
I have to say, I dislike it very much.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.083
Yeah, it fucking sucks.

32:24.166 --> 32:27.708
All right, look... on three,
we're gonna dump this asshole.

32:27.791 --> 32:29.166
All right?

32:29.583 --> 32:32.083
- Right. That makes sense.
- Use force.

32:32.166 --> 32:33.333
-All right.
-Yeah.

32:33.625 --> 32:36.333
One, two, three.

32:43.166 --> 32:44.750
-You all right?
-Hmm? Yeah.

32:44.833 --> 32:46.583
-No holes?
-Huh? Uh...

32:46.708 --> 32:48.500
Only the ones that I was born with.

32:49.333 --> 32:50.333
How are your holes?

32:51.500 --> 32:53.500
The fuck can you make
a shootout awkward?

32:54.166 --> 32:55.000
Sorry.

32:55.750 --> 32:56.791
Sorry.

33:03.250 --> 33:05.125
Wait for the reload! All right?

33:05.208 --> 33:07.125
-He's gonna have to reload.
-Reload.

33:07.208 --> 33:08.458
Now!

33:12.875 --> 33:14.458
Shit.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.250
We got him.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.000
Get the door. Get the door.

33:29.125 --> 33:32.083
-Shouldn't we wait for the cavalry?
-We are the cavalry.

33:33.250 --> 33:36.041
Ward, can't we wait for backup? Ward.

33:37.958 --> 33:39.000
Go, go, go.

33:40.500 --> 33:43.416
I smell blood, Ward.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.708
Lots of blood.

33:50.541 --> 33:52.500
- What's that?
- Don't know.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.375
Oh, shit.

33:59.458 --> 34:00.958
- Body. Body.
- What?

34:02.750 --> 34:05.250
Shit. Shit.

34:08.458 --> 34:09.458
Cover the hall.

34:09.541 --> 34:11.083
-What the fuck is that?
-Cover the hall.

34:11.166 --> 34:12.041
Okay.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.708
Oh, shit.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.208
Don't touch anything.

34:23.291 --> 34:24.541
Yeah.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.000
- Body.
- Wh--?

34:33.875 --> 34:35.375
That's our shooter, he's down.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.833
Someone's in here. I can smell them.

34:42.541 --> 34:44.541
These people died so bad.

34:45.875 --> 34:46.708
Clear.

34:56.791 --> 35:00.125
Something unusual has happened here.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.541
Three-Adam-9, 341 Abrams.

35:02.625 --> 35:04.666
Possible Bright at our location.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.750
Request additional units and a supervisor.

35:06.833 --> 35:09.416
I repeat: Possible magic-user on scene.

35:15.125 --> 35:16.625
Hey! Freeze!

35:17.750 --> 35:19.625
You! Wait, stop!

35:20.833 --> 35:22.208
Hey! Hey!

35:25.333 --> 35:26.791
Stop running!

35:33.875 --> 35:36.291
-Hold her, hold her!
-Stop! Stop! Stop!

35:36.375 --> 35:37.375
What has she got?

35:37.458 --> 35:40.208
What is that? What is that?

35:44.208 --> 35:45.458
Go get the homies.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.833
Put it down or I'm gonna shoot you
in your face!

35:56.833 --> 35:57.666
Is that...?

35:58.875 --> 36:00.458
It's a Magic Wand.

36:03.875 --> 36:05.208
Who, uh...

36:06.750 --> 36:07.625
Who are you?

36:07.708 --> 36:09.541
Please protect me.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.166
She's speaking Elvish.

36:11.750 --> 36:13.041
I don't speak Elvish.

36:14.250 --> 36:17.125
Well, I took two years in high school,
but, uh...

36:21.291 --> 36:23.291
She said somebody's coming.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.416
Please protect me and the Wand.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.125
As far as I can tell, a Bright came in,
used the Wand, and...

36:35.000 --> 36:37.583
magicked everybody the fuck up. Uh...

36:37.916 --> 36:40.833
We need to evacuate this neighborhood,
secure the scene,

36:40.916 --> 36:42.708
hold the perimeter till the feds get here.

36:42.791 --> 36:44.333
What the fuck are you, new?

36:45.416 --> 36:48.291
- This is way above our pay grade.
- That's magic right there.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.375
That's whatever you want.

36:52.625 --> 36:54.208
You want a million dollars?

36:55.083 --> 36:56.333
You want ten million?

36:57.250 --> 36:59.083
You wanna be taller or shorter?

36:59.875 --> 37:01.208
Make your dick bigger?

37:01.916 --> 37:04.958
You wanna go back in time, marry the girl
who didn't blow you on prom night?

37:05.041 --> 37:06.708
That's how you do it, right there.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.416
Well, clearly,
we had different prom nights.

37:10.541 --> 37:13.416
But that is a Magic Wand,

37:13.500 --> 37:15.291
and you don't know how to use it.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.625
And you're gonna kill us all trying.

37:18.666 --> 37:22.041
Only a Bright can use a Wand,
and you don't look like a wizard to me.

37:22.416 --> 37:25.166
Don't put your hands on that Wand.

37:25.250 --> 37:27.500
- Hey, don't touch the Wand.
- I got it.

37:27.750 --> 37:28.916
Don't touch it.

37:29.500 --> 37:32.000
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be--

37:35.875 --> 37:37.166
Fucking ice cold.

37:46.125 --> 37:48.791
-All right, you're not stealing that Wand.
-Nobody's coming, Ward.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.166
Whoa. Hey--

37:53.125 --> 37:55.166
Fuck is you squaring off on, bitch?

37:55.833 --> 37:58.666
Hey, Sarge,
you need to talk to your boys right now.

37:58.750 --> 38:02.125
You need this just as much as we do,
maybe more.

38:02.250 --> 38:05.375
Your family depends on you.
Don't you wanna be there for them?

38:05.958 --> 38:07.125
What about Jakoby?

38:08.458 --> 38:12.041
Can you tell me your name?

38:13.708 --> 38:15.208
- Tikka.
- Tikka.

38:16.125 --> 38:17.625
My name is Tikka.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.291
We have to leave before she comes.

38:21.375 --> 38:23.541
Before who comes?

38:30.083 --> 38:31.416
It's not happening.

38:32.208 --> 38:34.416
No. No.

38:34.500 --> 38:35.500
Pollard, he's spinning.

38:35.583 --> 38:38.291
- No, he's not spinning worth shit.
- He's fine, he's fine.

38:38.375 --> 38:39.583
-This is stupid.
-Calm down.

38:39.666 --> 38:41.666
-Hey, fucking chill. He's fine.
-Back up.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.583
-He's fin-- Hey, hey!
-The fuck you gonna do?

38:43.666 --> 38:46.666
Calm down. Fucking calm down.
Back the fuck up.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.416
Back the fuck up. Listen. Listen.

38:50.583 --> 38:51.625
This is happening.

38:52.666 --> 38:55.000
- This is fucking happening.
- Fuck off of me.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.208
All right?

38:56.291 --> 38:57.583
-Fuck.
-It's okay.

38:58.583 --> 38:59.458
It's okay.

39:00.375 --> 39:04.458
There's no version of you walking out
of here with life as you know it intact.

39:04.541 --> 39:07.208
Fuck this. We are taking the Wand,
and the Orc dies.

39:07.291 --> 39:09.125
And you got a big decision right now.

39:09.833 --> 39:13.458
Either your little girl grows up
without a daddy  and  Jakoby dies,

39:13.541 --> 39:17.041
or just Jakoby dies.
And it is time to make a choice.

39:17.125 --> 39:19.500
You or him, Ward. You or him.

39:19.583 --> 39:23.083
Is tomorrow's  LA Times  gonna say
one cop died here, or two?

39:23.875 --> 39:27.125
Yeah, there it is .
He just caught up to it.

39:27.208 --> 39:28.333
Everyone wins.

39:28.416 --> 39:33.250
Department gets rid of Jakoby,
he dies a hero, public's happy.

39:33.791 --> 39:35.333
This report writes itself.

39:35.791 --> 39:37.375
The perfect storm, bro.

39:39.333 --> 39:40.708
It's the perfect storm.

39:53.000 --> 39:53.958
You okay?

39:54.041 --> 39:56.500
Hey. Take Sophia,
get out of town right now.

39:56.583 --> 39:57.833
What? Why?

39:58.416 --> 40:01.125
Get out of town right now. I love you.

40:05.708 --> 40:09.041
Ward, where is everyone?
We haven't even set a perimeter.

40:09.125 --> 40:11.750
I'm pretty certain that pee-wee gangster
saw the Wand.

40:11.833 --> 40:14.666
And she is spooked.
Says somebody's coming.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.833
Like-- Like, someone bad.

40:17.875 --> 40:18.875
But what's...?

40:19.333 --> 40:21.791
You seem like you-you have
bigger troubles.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.208
You let the shooter go, didn't you?

40:26.000 --> 40:27.416
'Cause he was clan blood?

40:27.500 --> 40:30.875
Now? You wanna fucking go through this
right now?

40:31.458 --> 40:32.875
What else you lie about, pigface?

40:32.958 --> 40:35.041
Don't put your fucking hands on me!

40:36.666 --> 40:37.625
You fucked me.

40:38.625 --> 40:40.125
You fucked us both.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.208
Pigskin piece of shit.

40:42.666 --> 40:47.250
You fucked my whole life
over some stupid Orc knucklehead.

40:47.333 --> 40:49.458
Fuck you, Ward.

40:49.541 --> 40:50.458
Fuck off.

40:52.250 --> 40:53.958
-What--?
-I dare you.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.333
I dare you to pull your gun. Please.

40:57.666 --> 40:58.583
Go ahead.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.375
I will fuck you up in a gunfight.

41:07.458 --> 41:09.875
I gave you plenty of time
to talk about this shit.

41:09.958 --> 41:12.583
-Karma is a bitch, and here it come.
-I let him go.

41:14.125 --> 41:15.708
So what's the real plan?

41:16.291 --> 41:17.791
Two cops die tonight.

41:18.708 --> 41:19.833
What about the Elf?

41:20.250 --> 41:21.541
I'll kill her.

41:21.625 --> 41:23.125
- You good?
- Yes, sir.

41:23.750 --> 41:25.083
-Yeah.
-Sarge?

41:27.875 --> 41:29.625
You see my teeth? They're filed.

41:29.708 --> 41:33.333
I'm not blooded, my father's not blooded,
his father's not blooded.

41:33.750 --> 41:36.958
I've been shit on by Orcs
my whole fucking life.

41:37.208 --> 41:40.875
Huh? You know what that feels like,
when your own people hate you?

41:41.500 --> 41:42.708
Why'd you lie, Nick?

41:42.791 --> 41:44.625
It wasn't clan politics.

41:46.541 --> 41:48.083
I just had the wrong guy.

41:48.458 --> 41:49.416
Oh.

41:49.708 --> 41:50.541
Story time?

41:50.625 --> 41:53.291
The guy that shot you,
I lost him in the crowd.

41:53.375 --> 41:57.708
I circled back, and I thought I had
that fucking guy dead to rights.

41:57.791 --> 42:00.208
But it was a different kid.
He was just tagging.

42:00.291 --> 42:01.583
And the troops are coming.

42:01.666 --> 42:05.166
Jacked-up humans with guns
looking for an Orc who'd shot a cop.

42:06.416 --> 42:08.083
You think that kid had a chance?

42:08.166 --> 42:09.166
Go, go, go!

42:09.250 --> 42:12.541
They would've dropped him on the spot,
so I did the right thing.

42:13.291 --> 42:14.291
-Code four.
-Clear.

42:14.875 --> 42:18.458
You never saw his face. How'd you know
it wasn't the motherfucker that shot me?

42:18.791 --> 42:20.125
His fucking smell.

42:21.916 --> 42:24.791
Yeah, years of evolution haven't
taken away our sense of smell.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.208
And he smelled different.

42:26.291 --> 42:29.541
-What human jury would believe me?
-What, he have Axe body spray?

42:29.625 --> 42:31.791
Yeah, see, this is what
I have to fucking deal with.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.916
The Orc that shot you...

42:36.125 --> 42:37.500
-got away.
-Ward!

42:38.291 --> 42:39.250
It's time.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.666
"It's... time"?

42:43.291 --> 42:45.166
Time for-- Time for what?

42:48.625 --> 42:50.208
All four of 'em standing there?

42:51.416 --> 42:53.875
-Yeah.
-Your left to right, who is it?

42:54.625 --> 42:58.000
Brown, Hicks, Pollard, and Ching.

Don't.

43:53.458 --> 43:54.541
Partner, no!

43:55.500 --> 43:57.500
Drop it, or I will fucking kill you.

43:58.208 --> 44:00.250
Hey, listen to me.

44:00.583 --> 44:01.791
This isn't like you.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.666
All right, calm down.

44:07.750 --> 44:10.208
-I know it looks bad.
-Shut up. Shut up, show me your hands.

44:10.291 --> 44:12.291
-I didn't have a choice, Nick.
-Shut up.

44:12.375 --> 44:13.708
Now turn back around!

44:14.375 --> 44:15.375
What's your plan?

44:15.958 --> 44:16.791
I'm...

44:17.750 --> 44:19.916
I'm gonna arrest you, so... so shut up!

44:20.250 --> 44:22.208
First of all, stop telling me to shut up.

44:22.291 --> 44:24.000
Second, I need  you  to shut up

44:24.083 --> 44:25.625
-and listen to me.
-Shut up!

44:25.708 --> 44:28.250
Turn around! Get on your fucking knees!

44:29.416 --> 44:32.375
Gonna have to fuckin' kill me if you think
you're gonna put me in handcuffs.

44:36.916 --> 44:39.625
Ward...

44:45.625 --> 44:46.666
Three-Adam-9.

44:47.625 --> 44:50.708
I got four officers down,
one officer conscious and breathing.

44:50.791 --> 44:51.875
Three officers...

44:52.666 --> 44:53.500
KMA.

44:53.625 --> 44:55.833
All units,
officer needs help, 341 Abrams.

44:55.916 --> 44:57.791
Officer needs help, 341 Abrams.

44:57.875 --> 44:59.791
- Roger on the RA.
- Oh, this is bad.

45:00.291 --> 45:01.500
This is so bad.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.958
Put your big girl panties on.

45:06.333 --> 45:09.666
They were gonna kill us...
over that Wand, all right?

45:09.750 --> 45:10.750
They were acting crazy.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.625
Don't you say a word.
Not to me, not to anybody.

45:13.708 --> 45:15.666
Jakoby?
Jakoby, who are these people?

45:15.750 --> 45:18.166
Oh, shit. Put her in the truck.
Put her in the truck.

45:18.833 --> 45:20.083
Keep the Wand safe!

45:23.916 --> 45:24.958
Motherfucker, what?

45:25.375 --> 45:26.875
Protect the Wand.

45:27.208 --> 45:30.208
Those cops there... they okay?

45:31.416 --> 45:32.750
That's a lot of blood, homes.

45:33.541 --> 45:35.000
That ain't none of your concern.

45:35.375 --> 45:38.666
Maybe you should go over and give 'em
a little mouth-to-mouth. Huh?

45:39.166 --> 45:40.958
This is an active crime scene.

45:41.791 --> 45:44.708
We ain't never had no beef, Poison.
Why don't you take your people home.

45:44.833 --> 45:47.625
Word on the street,
there's a Wand in this hood.

45:47.708 --> 45:48.958
Where's it at, man?

45:49.041 --> 45:50.833
-My hood.
-Altamira.

45:50.916 --> 45:52.583
Alta-fucking-mira, eh?

45:53.000 --> 45:54.000
That's right.

45:54.125 --> 45:58.583
So, when the little homies tell
that the cops are shooting each other

45:59.166 --> 46:00.083
in my hood...

46:02.083 --> 46:04.458
makes me wonder. Hmm?

46:05.250 --> 46:06.291
Where's the Wand?

46:06.375 --> 46:07.666
Ghetto rumors, homie.

46:08.583 --> 46:11.291
Don't wanna get shot in your face
over a rumor, do you?

46:11.500 --> 46:12.833
Why don't you go head home?

46:12.916 --> 46:14.666
The Wand belongs to the people.

46:14.750 --> 46:16.666
- To the barrio.
- Get back!

46:17.750 --> 46:18.791
Homeboy.

46:18.875 --> 46:20.750
-You heard me.
-Smooth.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.666
It's mine...

46:24.000 --> 46:27.166
if I have to kill every fucking cop in LA.

46:27.250 --> 46:30.625
You're gonna get your chance,
'cause SWAT is about 90 seconds out.

46:31.791 --> 46:33.083
Nick, get in the truck.

46:33.666 --> 46:34.875
Get in the fucking truck, Nick!

46:34.958 --> 46:37.291
-Listen to your master. Get in the truck.
-Fuck you.

46:37.375 --> 46:38.875
-Fuck you, homie.
-Fuck you.

46:38.958 --> 46:41.541
What is that,
a fuckin' Labradoodle you dipped in ink?

46:41.625 --> 46:44.708
- Messed with puerco, homie.
- Fucking ugly-ass motherfucker.

46:44.791 --> 46:47.416
Looks like a  puerco to me.

46:50.916 --> 46:52.500
Get me that Wand.

46:52.583 --> 46:53.791
Windows up, bulletproof.

46:54.666 --> 46:57.125
-Is a SWAT team coming?
-No, Nick. Go. Go!

47:04.000 --> 47:06.625
-Wrong way, Nick.
-Yeah, well, someone was on the car.

47:11.458 --> 47:13.500
Come back, you motherfucker!

47:14.541 --> 47:16.541
Bulletproof, dickhead.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.708
Go, go, go, go!

47:23.208 --> 47:25.333
Let's get the fuck outta here.
Drive like you stole it.

47:32.250 --> 47:35.125
Altamira gang, homie.
Let's get these motherfuckers.

47:50.791 --> 47:52.125
Go! Go!

48:10.875 --> 48:13.666
Drive straight, not sideways!

48:22.625 --> 48:23.750
Shit, I'm out.

48:26.250 --> 48:28.250
-Shit.
-Butterfingers.

48:29.041 --> 48:30.500
We were doing so good.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.708
They don't teach that at the academy.

49:10.875 --> 49:12.125
No, they do not.

49:17.625 --> 49:20.416
We have to turn back.
Stop the car. Inferni!

49:20.500 --> 49:22.333
-Inferni! Inferni!
-Relax, relax.

49:22.416 --> 49:24.791
- The hell is she saying?
- She won't let it go!

49:24.875 --> 49:27.708
Oh, shit!

49:28.000 --> 49:29.208
What's happening? Hey!

49:29.291 --> 49:31.958
Hey, shut up! Shut up! What is that?

49:32.625 --> 49:35.000
Shut up!

49:55.083 --> 49:57.541
-The fuck?
-Problem?

49:57.625 --> 50:00.708
Tech services is flagging
some weird-ass cell phone inter...

50:03.708 --> 50:05.416
Talking about a Magic Wand.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.875
Help me. Help.

50:54.250 --> 50:55.375
Larika.

51:00.875 --> 51:02.750
Oh...

51:04.333 --> 51:07.125
Leilah. The traitor escaped.

51:11.958 --> 51:14.333
She has your Wand.

52:34.166 --> 52:36.708
I got blood in my eye.
What the fuck did we hit?

52:36.791 --> 52:37.750
Oh, that was the Wand.

52:38.166 --> 52:40.041
You know what a binding spell is?

52:40.125 --> 52:43.166
It stops it from getting too far away
from its owner.

52:43.500 --> 52:44.500
Pulls it back.

52:44.583 --> 52:46.875
Owner? Who owns a Wand?

52:48.750 --> 52:49.791
A Bright.

53:02.333 --> 53:03.666
Please, sir.

53:15.416 --> 53:17.083
Tell me what happened.

53:17.833 --> 53:19.375
Tell me.

53:21.541 --> 53:24.833
Cops started shooting at each other,

53:25.291 --> 53:27.875
and a black cop killed them all.

53:28.625 --> 53:31.416
He left with an Orc cop and an Elf girl.

53:31.791 --> 53:33.708
An Elf?

53:38.416 --> 53:41.416
No! No!

53:57.833 --> 54:02.416
Okay, you know what?
You need to sit your crazy ass down.

54:03.250 --> 54:06.583
Look, half of our division is on some
old-school Rampart shit, a'ight?

54:06.666 --> 54:09.791
They're gonna kill you first,
then they're gonna kill me,

54:09.875 --> 54:11.000
they're gonna take the Wand,

54:11.083 --> 54:13.250
and that's when the stupid shit's
gonna start.

54:13.708 --> 54:17.250
And by the way, that's only
if the gangstas don't get it first.

54:17.833 --> 54:20.541
And that's when the triple stupid shit's
gonna start.

54:20.625 --> 54:22.375
We gotta get out of this neighborhood.

54:22.458 --> 54:26.458
Yeah, but the Wand is gonna stop us.
The binding spell is gonna stop us.

54:27.208 --> 54:28.458
We'll hide the Wand.

54:28.541 --> 54:30.375
We'll hide it here
and come back and get it.

54:30.458 --> 54:32.083
I am not abandoning the Wand.

54:32.166 --> 54:36.416
-We are not the fucking Wand police.
-You want bodies on the street? Huh?

54:36.541 --> 54:37.791
All of LA on fire?

54:37.875 --> 54:41.083
This is like a nuclear weapon
that grants wishes.

54:41.166 --> 54:44.541
No. The feds have people

54:44.625 --> 54:46.000
that deal with magic.

54:46.083 --> 54:48.916
- We call them. We ask--
- You wanna call the feds?

54:49.000 --> 54:50.958
I got bodies on my gun, remember?

54:51.041 --> 54:53.625
Yeah, well, don't look at me,
I just let an Orc go.

54:53.708 --> 54:54.541
Really, Nick?

54:55.500 --> 54:56.333
Really?

54:56.416 --> 54:57.250
That was irony.

54:57.333 --> 54:59.916
-No, that's just being an asshole.
-Oh.

55:00.541 --> 55:03.125
Gonna call Rodriguez.
He's a sheriff, he's not LAPD.

55:03.208 --> 55:05.666
-He's solid as fuck. We can trust him.
-That's a good idea.

55:05.750 --> 55:07.125
Shh, shh.

55:07.208 --> 55:09.708
- They're coming for the Wand.
- Ah, shit.

55:12.416 --> 55:14.250
- What is it?
- The lock.

55:14.916 --> 55:17.583
We left the lock outside on the ground.
Go.

55:24.375 --> 55:26.166
Partner, look out!

55:27.833 --> 55:29.208
Come on! Come on! Come on!

55:46.416 --> 55:48.583
Let's go! Let's go!

55:51.833 --> 55:53.500
Nick, let's go.

55:53.583 --> 55:55.083
Come on, let's go!

55:55.166 --> 55:56.291
What is your problem?

55:56.875 --> 55:58.208
Wait! I dropped the Wand.

55:58.291 --> 55:59.875
Don't you fucking touch that!

56:14.791 --> 56:16.166
Where did they all go?

56:16.958 --> 56:18.666
I think we're breathing 'em.

56:29.416 --> 56:32.291
-Hey, do me a favor.
-Uh-huh?

56:32.375 --> 56:34.250
Don't drop that shit no more.

56:35.250 --> 56:36.541
What? No.

56:37.041 --> 56:38.083
Why would I?

56:49.416 --> 56:52.166
Ah, shit! Ah!

56:56.000 --> 56:56.916
Ward...

56:58.541 --> 57:00.791
I shot a human. Did you see?

57:00.875 --> 57:03.333
Yeah, I'll get you some ice cream later.
Damn.

57:07.041 --> 57:08.833
- I'm hit.
- What?

57:10.458 --> 57:13.708
They're not gonna stop.
They're gonna keep coming. Let's go.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.333
What are you doing here?

57:22.708 --> 57:24.083
You fucking traitor.

57:26.291 --> 57:27.500
Keep walking.

58:20.500 --> 58:21.375
Tikka!

58:26.916 --> 58:28.000
Where's Tikka?

58:29.000 --> 58:29.916
Tikka!

58:30.291 --> 58:32.333
On my back! Get on my back!

58:51.583 --> 58:52.833
Get those fucking cops.

58:53.541 --> 58:54.375
Tikka!

59:00.041 --> 59:01.333
Ward?

59:03.125 --> 59:05.041
Ward!

59:06.625 --> 59:07.833
You want some of this?

59:08.958 --> 59:11.791
I found Tikka. Let's go!

59:15.041 --> 59:16.708
Tikka! Get down!

59:18.250 --> 59:20.291
Ward, this way!

59:32.583 --> 59:34.416
-Execute.
-Sir.

59:35.208 --> 59:38.583
- Move! Let's go! Move!
- Confirmed use of magic.

1:00:04.166 --> 1:00:05.500
She's Inferni.

1:00:10.583 --> 1:00:11.666
What a shitshow.

1:00:12.416 --> 1:00:15.166
You want to, uh, unpack this for me, boss?

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:16.916
Leilah.

1:00:21.791 --> 1:00:22.750
Leilah was here.

1:00:23.250 --> 1:00:24.750
What are you talking about?

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:30.291
She was sent to kill Tikka,

1:00:30.875 --> 1:00:33.208
-then Tikka did that.
-She wants her Wand back, right?

1:00:33.291 --> 1:00:34.750
-Yes.
-And Tikka has it.

1:00:34.833 --> 1:00:38.875
-Yes.
-And those cops she ran off with, uh...

1:00:40.375 --> 1:00:42.041
Ward and--

1:00:42.125 --> 1:00:43.916
What? Jakoby.

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.875
The Orc cop we saw at the station.

1:00:46.208 --> 1:00:48.083
They have no idea who Tikka is.

1:00:48.958 --> 1:00:50.291
It's been 20 years.

1:00:50.375 --> 1:00:51.958
What does that even mean?

1:00:52.041 --> 1:00:53.833
Twenty years I've been hunting Leilah.

1:00:54.958 --> 1:00:56.083
Without her Wand...

1:00:56.875 --> 1:00:58.125
she's vulnerable.

1:01:08.375 --> 1:01:10.791
Now's a bad time to go shopping, Ward.

1:01:10.916 --> 1:01:13.625
Everybody's looking for two cops.
We gotta switch it up.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.416
Oh, yeah.

1:01:15.791 --> 1:01:19.708
Running through a Fogteeth party
is not good community policing.

1:01:20.041 --> 1:01:22.791
Yeah, well, we're alive,
and we got the Wand.

1:01:23.125 --> 1:01:25.791
Orcs hold grudges. That's all I'm saying.

1:01:26.208 --> 1:01:28.666
Tell me about it.
Hey, follow me. Let's go.

1:01:28.750 --> 1:01:30.375
Tikka.

1:01:31.208 --> 1:01:32.958
-Oh, thank you, ma'am.
- Go.

1:02:00.250 --> 1:02:01.916
-That's good.
-Thank you.

1:02:11.791 --> 1:02:14.875
Take your old lady,
get the fuck outta here. Go. Go.

1:02:18.916 --> 1:02:21.000
I need you to get the fuck outta here.
All right? Go.

1:02:21.083 --> 1:02:21.958
Jesus.

1:02:41.125 --> 1:02:41.958
Whoo!

1:02:47.625 --> 1:02:50.583
Seven dudes with choppers
down the right, five down the left.

1:02:50.666 --> 1:02:52.000
Bunch of motherfuckers in the middle.

1:02:58.416 --> 1:02:59.500
Officer Ward...

1:03:00.958 --> 1:03:02.166
I think we need to talk.

1:03:02.250 --> 1:03:03.833
Hey, Poison, how you doing?

1:03:03.916 --> 1:03:06.041
Some fucked-up shit went down tonight.

1:03:06.125 --> 1:03:09.541
My homies wanna cut your fucking head off,
the cops wanna cut your fucking head off,

1:03:09.625 --> 1:03:11.833
the Fogteeth gang
wanna cut your fucking head off.

1:03:11.916 --> 1:03:14.041
Yeah, I got that effect on people, Poison.

1:03:14.166 --> 1:03:15.750
Imagine how my old lady feels.

1:03:15.916 --> 1:03:18.000
Me? I just wanna protect you.

1:03:18.458 --> 1:03:19.583
Mmm.

1:03:19.666 --> 1:03:24.083
Get you home safe and sound,
with all your sins forgiven.

1:03:24.166 --> 1:03:25.750
But you gotta give me that Wand.

1:03:25.833 --> 1:03:27.541
You wanna do the right thing?

1:03:28.583 --> 1:03:30.083
Help me walk again.

1:03:30.458 --> 1:03:32.500
Help me make love to my old lady again.

1:03:32.583 --> 1:03:34.333
Help me get rid of this shit again.

1:03:36.833 --> 1:03:40.750
Give me the fucking Wand, or I will nail
every door in this place shut

1:03:40.833 --> 1:03:43.083
and burn this place down
to the fucking ground.

1:03:43.166 --> 1:03:47.958
And then I will pick up the Wand
from the ashes, and I will laugh.

1:03:49.791 --> 1:03:52.291
Chopping it up with the homie for a sec,
Poison.

1:03:52.375 --> 1:03:55.250
I'm running out of patience, Officer Ward.

1:04:04.833 --> 1:04:07.291
-Let's give this motherfucker the Wand.
-What?

1:04:07.375 --> 1:04:10.166
Look, we gonna get
everybody in here killed,

1:04:10.250 --> 1:04:12.208
and then he's gonna
take the damn Wand anyway.

1:04:12.583 --> 1:04:14.250
I'm not giving that guy the Wand.

1:04:15.250 --> 1:04:16.458
Over my dead body.

1:04:17.125 --> 1:04:18.833
He's gonna have to kill me first.

1:04:18.916 --> 1:04:21.000
So you wanna die in a gunfight

1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:23.500
in a nasty-ass titty bar?

1:04:23.583 --> 1:04:25.083
That's what you want?

1:04:25.375 --> 1:04:27.291
I don't wanna die anywhere.

1:04:27.375 --> 1:04:31.541
You know what? Now I do. Fuck it.
I wanna die. Let's do it right now.

1:04:31.625 --> 1:04:33.083
We gonna titty-bar-gunfight die.

1:04:33.166 --> 1:04:34.958
Let's do it right here, right now. Ready?

1:04:35.041 --> 1:04:36.875
I just wish your dumb ass
was a better shot.

1:04:39.458 --> 1:04:41.875
-What she say?
-She says the devil is coming.

1:04:41.958 --> 1:04:44.041
The devil's ass is out there
in that wheelchair.

1:04:44.875 --> 1:04:47.125
-Let's go. On three. One...
-Let's do it.

1:04:47.208 --> 1:04:48.750
-...two... three.
-Yeah.

1:05:10.208 --> 1:05:11.500
Oh, shit.

1:05:11.583 --> 1:05:13.541
Go, go, go!

1:05:19.958 --> 1:05:21.083
Go! Go, go, go!

1:05:21.541 --> 1:05:22.416
Move!

1:05:30.416 --> 1:05:32.250
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

1:05:34.250 --> 1:05:35.166
Hurry!

1:05:36.375 --> 1:05:38.541
LAPD!

1:05:40.041 --> 1:05:42.333
- Oh, fuck. Come on!
- Who is she?

1:05:42.750 --> 1:05:45.083
Inferni! She wants her Wand.

1:05:48.666 --> 1:05:49.500
Move!

1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:20.791
I'm not a cop after tonight, am I?

1:06:21.375 --> 1:06:23.416
No. Neither am I.

1:06:25.708 --> 1:06:28.750
I think we should probably spend our time

1:06:29.458 --> 1:06:32.333
-just trying to survive this shit.
-Survive?

1:06:34.708 --> 1:06:36.833
Being a cop is all I've got.

1:06:37.416 --> 1:06:39.750
Right now I'm still a cop,
and if I die tonight,

1:06:39.833 --> 1:06:41.791
I'll be a cop forever. I'll be a...

1:06:41.875 --> 1:06:43.375
I'll be a hero forever.

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:48.250
Why the fuck do you wanna die for a world
that doesn't give a shit about you?

1:06:49.833 --> 1:06:52.458
Orcs chose the wrong side a long time ago

1:06:52.541 --> 1:06:54.416
and they've been paying for it ever since.

1:06:55.750 --> 1:06:57.375
You know, when an Orc sees me...

1:06:59.166 --> 1:07:02.083
they see a man... a wannabee human.

1:07:02.166 --> 1:07:04.791
When humans see me, they see an animal.

1:07:05.166 --> 1:07:06.125
They hate me.

1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:08.416
They don't hate you.

1:07:08.500 --> 1:07:11.458
We know when people like us
and when they don't.

1:07:11.541 --> 1:07:12.791
Like you, Ward.

1:07:13.250 --> 1:07:17.708
When you came out of that house
with pure hatred in your eyes.

1:07:18.666 --> 1:07:21.250
Pure... hatred.

1:07:23.375 --> 1:07:25.583
Look, I told you what that was, all right?

1:07:30.083 --> 1:07:34.125
Why didn't you tell me the truth
about helping the Orc kid?

1:07:36.041 --> 1:07:37.916
I'm not saying it would've changed...

1:07:39.041 --> 1:07:41.208
anything, but, shit, it might have.

1:07:42.250 --> 1:07:43.500
I got confused.

1:07:44.791 --> 1:07:48.916
And with humans, you understand,
everything is so definite.

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.375
Like, you say something,
and all of a sudden it's law,

1:07:52.458 --> 1:07:54.125
and you can't walk it back.

1:07:54.208 --> 1:07:55.458
You gotta tell me...

1:07:56.291 --> 1:07:58.083
if I'm supposed to be your partner.

1:07:58.708 --> 1:08:01.500
I don't care what we'll say to them,
but you gotta tell me the truth.

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:03.250
You can't lie to  me .

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:06.791
Oh, so I'm supposed to trust you
when you don't trust me?

1:08:09.583 --> 1:08:10.666
That's a good point.

1:08:17.541 --> 1:08:18.666
You're a good cop.

1:08:20.250 --> 1:08:23.208
And people are really hard on you, so...

1:08:24.708 --> 1:08:26.416
you're really hard on yourself.

1:08:38.583 --> 1:08:39.916
Come on, crazy.

1:08:40.458 --> 1:08:44.041
Ward, do you know that you are
who I wish I was?

1:08:44.666 --> 1:08:45.708
You're fearless.

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:48.375
You always know what to do.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:50.375
What you did tonight,

1:08:50.750 --> 1:08:53.875
that's what it takes for an Orc
to get blooded.

1:08:54.625 --> 1:08:56.416
An act of great bravery.

1:08:57.875 --> 1:09:00.375
To me, you're like a blooded human.

1:09:02.166 --> 1:09:03.666
I used to be like you.

1:09:04.875 --> 1:09:08.083
Think you can save everybody
and fix everything and...

1:09:11.166 --> 1:09:13.416
Now I just pretend to be a good dude.

1:09:17.541 --> 1:09:18.916
You still are one.

1:09:22.458 --> 1:09:23.708
Are we friends?

1:09:24.333 --> 1:09:26.875
Nah, Nick. We're not friends, man.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.791
You don't want me as a friend.

1:10:01.708 --> 1:10:03.208
Show me your fucking hands, Ward.

1:10:03.291 --> 1:10:04.958
Whoa, Rodriguez, what are you doing?

1:10:05.041 --> 1:10:06.750
Show me your fucking hands.

1:10:06.833 --> 1:10:09.125
-Hey! I called you.
-Show me your fucking hands.

1:10:09.208 --> 1:10:11.291
-Are you a part of this?
-Part of what?

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:14.500
All I know is I heard chatter on the radio
saying you killed a bunch of cops.

1:10:14.583 --> 1:10:17.125
-Put your gun down. Listen, the guys--
-Shut the fuck up.

1:10:17.208 --> 1:10:19.041
- Hey!
- Yo! Drop the weapon.

1:10:19.625 --> 1:10:22.250
-Tikka, stop. All right. Relax.
-Drop the fucking weapon!

1:10:22.333 --> 1:10:23.500
Drop it now!

1:10:23.583 --> 1:10:26.291
-Rodriguez. Listen to me.
-Get away from the gun!

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:27.208
Listen!

1:10:27.791 --> 1:10:32.083
The guys on our watch tried to do us
over a Wand.

1:10:32.416 --> 1:10:33.750
We have a Wand.

1:10:34.041 --> 1:10:35.458
We have a Magic Wand.

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.416
-All right, show me the Wand.
-Don't show him shit.

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:42.041
-He's gonna shoot us and take it.
-Slow.

1:10:42.125 --> 1:10:43.916
Jakoby!

1:10:58.625 --> 1:10:59.791
Shit.

1:11:02.708 --> 1:11:06.125
Okay, first thing we gotta do
is keep that away from the bad guys.

1:11:06.208 --> 1:11:08.833
-I'm gonna make a phone call. Put it down.
-All right.

1:11:08.916 --> 1:11:11.083
-Put it down. Now step back!
-Rodriguez--

1:11:11.166 --> 1:11:13.833
Step the-- God damn it!
What the fuck? Is that an Elf?

1:11:13.916 --> 1:11:16.000
-Rodriguez, put the phone down.
-Step the fuck back!

1:11:16.083 --> 1:11:18.250
-Put your phone down.
-I'm calling the feds.

1:11:18.333 --> 1:11:20.416
-It's what we're supposed to do.
-Listen to me.

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:23.583
-Chill. Chill. Chill.
-Listen. We don't know who's dirty.

1:11:23.666 --> 1:11:25.708
-Rodriguez, put the phone down.
-Shut the fuck up.

1:11:25.791 --> 1:11:26.916
-Put the phone do--
-Hold on!

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:28.083
Don't tell 'em shit.

1:11:29.958 --> 1:11:31.791
I got a deputy claiming to have the Wand.

1:11:34.208 --> 1:11:35.208
Yes?

1:11:35.291 --> 1:11:36.833
They wanna know where we're at.

1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:38.583
Give me the phone.

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:40.458
Give me the phone.

1:11:42.291 --> 1:11:43.291
Who is this?

1:11:43.875 --> 1:11:44.875
Who's this?

1:11:45.583 --> 1:11:46.958
The motherfucker with the Wand.

1:11:50.541 --> 1:11:53.166
You called us. Where are you?

1:11:54.083 --> 1:11:55.458
All right, look...

1:11:57.166 --> 1:11:59.625
I got the Wand, but I need something.

1:12:00.583 --> 1:12:03.458
-You need forgiveness.
-If I give you this Wand.

1:12:04.083 --> 1:12:05.333
And let's just say...

1:12:06.208 --> 1:12:10.416
I don't know, somebody accused me of,
uh, some dumb shit, like...

1:12:10.791 --> 1:12:12.291
killing a bunch of cops.

1:12:12.375 --> 1:12:14.791
A man like you could fix that shit, right?

1:12:15.208 --> 1:12:20.041
If you were protecting a weapon of magic
from, let's say, corrupt individuals...

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.041
there would be no charges.

1:12:22.125 --> 1:12:23.833
That's exactly what happened.

1:12:24.041 --> 1:12:24.958
Hypothetically.

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:27.166
A man like you could dead that noise,
right?

1:12:27.250 --> 1:12:30.250
- Do you have the Elf girl?
- Yeah.

1:12:32.458 --> 1:12:33.750
Yo.

1:12:40.750 --> 1:12:42.916
-Can only narrow it down to a few blocks.
-Okay.

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.250
Come on, let's go! Move out! Move out!

1:12:49.166 --> 1:12:51.041
-The phone died.
-Shit.

1:12:53.416 --> 1:12:56.041
-All right, look--
-Okay. No, hold the-- Hold the fuck up.

1:12:56.125 --> 1:12:57.875
-Hey, Rodriguez--
-Have to cuff your partner.

1:12:57.958 --> 1:13:00.666
-Nobody's handcuffing anybody.
-It doesn't look good.

1:13:00.750 --> 1:13:02.625
A fucking Orc and a bunch of dead cops?

1:13:02.708 --> 1:13:04.708
All right.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1:13:04.791 --> 1:13:06.500
I'm just being real with you, man.

1:13:06.750 --> 1:13:08.083
They want it to be Jakoby.

1:13:08.375 --> 1:13:09.625
Okay? Whether it's him or not.

1:13:09.750 --> 1:13:11.666
If he's not cuffed
by the time they get here,

1:13:11.750 --> 1:13:13.375
they're gonna smoke
both of you motherfuckers.

1:13:13.458 --> 1:13:14.583
-Cuff your partner.
-Don't--

1:13:14.666 --> 1:13:16.916
-Ward, it's okay.
-Don't reach on me like that.

1:13:18.041 --> 1:13:19.458
We can't run all night.

1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:21.541
Let's do it.

1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:25.125
It's time to end this.

1:13:25.208 --> 1:13:26.291
Let's go in.

1:13:29.666 --> 1:13:31.750
Take my gun.

1:13:34.416 --> 1:13:35.250
Turn around.

1:13:36.541 --> 1:13:37.500
Hey, Ward...

1:13:37.916 --> 1:13:39.458
I can't go to prison.

1:13:40.166 --> 1:13:41.541
They'll skin me alive.

1:13:41.625 --> 1:13:44.291
You're not going to jail.
You didn't do shit.

1:13:44.666 --> 1:13:45.750
I shot everybody.

1:13:45.958 --> 1:13:48.291
Ward, shut the fuck up and lawyer up.

1:13:48.375 --> 1:13:49.375
Aah!

1:13:50.375 --> 1:13:52.541
Get inside! Get inside! Go!

1:13:57.625 --> 1:14:00.083
Shit. What was that?

1:14:01.500 --> 1:14:04.208
Good girl. Let me out. Let me out.
You see anything?

1:14:04.291 --> 1:14:07.208
- No, I can't see anything.
- Sir, get away from that window!

1:14:09.125 --> 1:14:12.083
Oh, shit! Move! Come on!

1:15:05.833 --> 1:15:07.250
Traitor.

1:15:35.750 --> 1:15:37.625
Oh, shit, shit.

1:15:51.541 --> 1:15:53.708
Get me out. Get me out.

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:54.958
Get me out!

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.041
Oh, God.

1:16:33.208 --> 1:16:35.750
Oh, shit.

1:16:39.041 --> 1:16:41.291
I told you Orcs hold grudges.
Huh? What'd I say?

1:16:41.375 --> 1:16:44.208
All right, look. I'm gonna cut you a break
on the reckless driving.

1:16:44.291 --> 1:16:47.875
But I need you to return to your vehicles
and drive home safely.

1:16:47.958 --> 1:16:52.000
So I need you to take your fat
Shrek-looking ass

1:16:52.625 --> 1:16:56.250
back to your vehicle
and drive the fuck home to Fiona. A'ight?

1:16:56.333 --> 1:16:58.333
- Do you wanna go to jail?
- Fiona?

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.958
Tell these dickheads in Orkish

1:17:01.541 --> 1:17:04.583
to get the fuck back in their vehicles
and drive home,

1:17:04.666 --> 1:17:08.208
-or they're all going to jail.
-But... they speak English.

1:17:08.791 --> 1:17:11.833
But-- You understand, right?
Speak English?

1:17:11.916 --> 1:17:13.541
Yeah. Of course.

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:23.750
Take 'em to the church!

1:17:41.416 --> 1:17:42.625
You know...

1:17:44.291 --> 1:17:45.416
I'm not from here.

1:17:46.541 --> 1:17:47.958
I grew up in Miami.

1:17:48.875 --> 1:17:52.583
Great Orc communities there,
strong Orc communities.

1:17:52.666 --> 1:17:55.750
We'd have block parties
with dwarves and humans.

1:17:56.166 --> 1:17:58.416
It was fucking fun, man.

1:18:00.541 --> 1:18:02.375
I wasn't in the game then.

1:18:03.666 --> 1:18:04.958
I was a bus driver.

1:18:07.291 --> 1:18:08.583
Then I moved to LA.

1:18:08.916 --> 1:18:10.875
Fucking City of Angels, right?

1:18:11.833 --> 1:18:13.291
Listen, I would really appreciate it

1:18:13.375 --> 1:18:16.000
if you gave me the respect
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

1:18:17.416 --> 1:18:20.083
I get here and I see
how broke the system is.

1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.416
Orcs caught between the police
and the gangsters.

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.625
Elves making money off us.

1:18:27.166 --> 1:18:29.083
- So I organize...
- Tikka.

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:30.583
...my community.

1:18:31.541 --> 1:18:33.500
We got our own thing now.

1:18:34.083 --> 1:18:36.041
Every month...

1:18:37.666 --> 1:18:40.791
- Look at me, motherfucker.
- Sorry.

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:43.000
Every month...

1:18:44.791 --> 1:18:46.208
I throw a big party.

1:18:47.458 --> 1:18:49.291
Get everyone drunk, feed 'em.

1:18:50.458 --> 1:18:51.666
All races...

1:18:52.166 --> 1:18:54.541
partying together, with one rule.

1:18:56.291 --> 1:18:57.250
No guns.

1:18:59.166 --> 1:19:00.833
After years of peace...

1:19:02.708 --> 1:19:04.208
who brings in the guns?

1:19:06.125 --> 1:19:07.083
We did, yeah.

1:19:07.166 --> 1:19:09.500
-The drama?
-Us.

1:19:11.875 --> 1:19:14.083
Disrespects our celebration?

1:19:15.416 --> 1:19:17.000
The motherfucking police!

1:19:18.916 --> 1:19:21.416
An unblooded Orc.

1:19:22.083 --> 1:19:26.458
Grew up with humans. Never had a hand
raised for him in respect.

1:19:26.541 --> 1:19:28.791
What's he saying?

1:19:28.875 --> 1:19:32.416
- Playing the nice guy.
- Nothing I haven't heard before.

1:19:32.833 --> 1:19:36.125
Your buddy's so happy to say
he's got a Orc friend.

1:19:36.208 --> 1:19:41.375
Shit. I'm stuck with this motherfucker.

1:19:41.458 --> 1:19:42.791
-Seriously?
-I'm just saying,

1:19:42.875 --> 1:19:45.500
ain't like we's stomping
through the club together.

1:19:45.583 --> 1:19:46.541
Ward.

1:19:50.125 --> 1:19:52.416
Where is the Wand?

1:19:53.125 --> 1:19:54.541
What Wand?

1:19:55.250 --> 1:19:57.583
- Hey, man, we're family.
- Hey, Nick.

1:19:57.916 --> 1:20:00.500
He's just trying to get in your head.
Don't let him in your head.

1:20:00.583 --> 1:20:03.541
I'm not trying to get in his head, man.
I'm in his soul.

1:20:04.958 --> 1:20:06.458
We're the same thing.

1:20:07.291 --> 1:20:09.875
-I'll tell you where the Wand is.
-Yeah?

1:20:11.708 --> 1:20:13.666
It's up your fucking ass.

1:20:21.500 --> 1:20:22.666
Where's the Wand?

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:27.333
Whip these motherfuckers.

1:20:46.625 --> 1:20:49.416
Get them!

1:20:50.375 --> 1:20:51.625
Don't hurt 'em.

1:20:52.166 --> 1:20:53.208
Pussy.

1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.166
Roundtooth.

1:20:59.250 --> 1:21:00.416
False Orc.

1:21:01.583 --> 1:21:02.625
Unblooded coward.

1:21:04.666 --> 1:21:07.666
Where is the Wand?

1:21:07.750 --> 1:21:10.833
What-- What Wand?

1:21:13.708 --> 1:21:16.083
You motherfucking dickhead!

1:21:17.083 --> 1:21:20.583
Where is the Wand?

1:21:23.041 --> 1:21:24.791
What Wa-- Wand?

1:21:24.875 --> 1:21:26.625
There's no Wand!

1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:37.500
Altamira thinks there's a Wand.

1:21:38.333 --> 1:21:40.375
The police think there's a Wand.

1:21:41.208 --> 1:21:43.875
The feds think there's a Wand.

1:21:44.708 --> 1:21:48.291
I think there's a Wand!

1:21:50.041 --> 1:21:52.500
There's no Wand.

1:21:52.583 --> 1:21:54.458
Ghetto Fairy tales.

1:21:58.750 --> 1:21:59.791
Bring me the Elf.

1:22:06.166 --> 1:22:08.875
I will cover you with her hot blood.

1:22:08.958 --> 1:22:10.791
She don't have shit to do with this.

1:22:10.875 --> 1:22:13.958
Where is the Wand?

1:22:14.041 --> 1:22:16.250
We are police off--

1:22:16.750 --> 1:22:17.750
officers.

1:22:18.666 --> 1:22:20.583
And you can't do this to us.

1:22:34.791 --> 1:22:35.958
Kill them!

1:22:45.333 --> 1:22:47.416
Watch your friends die, Elf.

1:22:58.250 --> 1:22:59.916
You didn't break.

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:01.750
You deserve to be blooded.

1:23:04.625 --> 1:23:06.791
You would have made a great Orc.

1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:12.541
I am... a great Orc.

1:23:22.333 --> 1:23:24.250
My son earns his colors tonight.

1:23:26.291 --> 1:23:27.208
Mikey.

1:23:47.541 --> 1:23:48.791
Bye, partner.

1:23:55.375 --> 1:23:57.125
Why are you waiting?

1:24:04.333 --> 1:24:06.958
Father... I know him.

1:24:08.916 --> 1:24:09.875
Ward...

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.916
He helped me escape from the police.

1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:15.500
That's the guy...

1:24:16.541 --> 1:24:17.666
that I let go.

1:24:19.416 --> 1:24:22.416
He saved my life. I cannot kill him.

1:24:29.208 --> 1:24:30.291
Go home.

1:24:33.666 --> 1:24:34.791
You can't be here.

1:25:16.125 --> 1:25:18.833
Fuck you, you green pig-nose
piece of shit.

1:25:18.916 --> 1:25:19.833
Shoot, bitch.

1:25:19.916 --> 1:25:22.166
-Beg for it! Beg!
-Shoot me, bitch. Shoot, bitch!

1:25:22.250 --> 1:25:23.416
Fuck you.

1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:25.875
-Show your respect!
-Fuck you! Do it! Shoot!

1:25:25.958 --> 1:25:29.041
-Shoot, motherfucker! Bring it!
-Give us respect! Here it comes!

1:26:26.125 --> 1:26:28.583
This is a Prophecy, for he has risen.

1:26:57.083 --> 1:26:59.583
Hey, hey.

1:27:04.208 --> 1:27:07.208
W-Ward?
What happened?

1:27:07.583 --> 1:27:09.708
Uh... Nothing. Why?

1:27:09.875 --> 1:27:12.791
Well, something happened. I feel great.

1:27:13.166 --> 1:27:14.208
Uh...

1:27:15.250 --> 1:27:17.583
- Nah, just go, go, go.
- Okay.

1:27:31.791 --> 1:27:32.958
You're a Bright?

1:27:33.625 --> 1:27:34.916
You're a fucking Bright?

1:27:35.708 --> 1:27:38.791
Would've been nice to know that
when we was getting fucked up.

1:27:38.875 --> 1:27:41.916
Could've had a magic helicopter
take us somewhere.

1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.125
I only started my training.

1:27:44.791 --> 1:27:46.291
I only know a few spell words.

1:27:47.458 --> 1:27:49.750
She speaks English pretty good now, too.

1:27:49.916 --> 1:27:52.291
- Now I trust you.
- Um...

1:27:53.166 --> 1:27:55.666
You gonna need to unfuck this, okay?

1:27:55.916 --> 1:27:59.083
A'ight? You gonna magic us to Palm Springs
or some shit.

1:27:59.166 --> 1:28:01.083
I saved your friend's life.

1:28:02.375 --> 1:28:03.625
Isn't that enough?

1:28:05.833 --> 1:28:07.333
It's a start, but--

1:28:07.416 --> 1:28:10.291
Uh, Ward, stop.
I happen to think it's a pretty big deal.

1:28:11.291 --> 1:28:12.250
Thank you.

1:28:13.541 --> 1:28:17.250
Now, Tikka, who are these Elves
who are hunting us?

1:28:18.625 --> 1:28:20.541
They're aiding the return
of the Dark Lord...

1:28:21.875 --> 1:28:24.125
so he can slaughter billions

1:28:24.208 --> 1:28:27.958
and enslave the survivors
to serve him in a new age of magic.

1:28:28.208 --> 1:28:29.875
Oh. That's all.

1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:32.333
Just some Illuminati shit.

1:28:32.458 --> 1:28:33.583
They're Inferni.

1:28:34.208 --> 1:28:36.833
They destroyed the Illuminati
a hundred years ago.

1:28:36.916 --> 1:28:38.208
How do you know all this?

1:28:38.916 --> 1:28:40.583
I, too, am Inferni.

1:28:43.666 --> 1:28:45.125
But I escaped.

1:28:46.916 --> 1:28:49.000
The Shield of Light hid me.

1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:53.041
Leilah gave an assassin her Wand
to kill me.

1:29:00.083 --> 1:29:02.333
But I got the Wand from her.

1:29:06.708 --> 1:29:08.541
Keep it away from Leilah.

1:29:09.416 --> 1:29:11.708
She mustn't get her Wand back.

1:29:11.958 --> 1:29:15.000
With it,
she can restore the Dark Lord to power.

1:29:15.083 --> 1:29:17.500
Hey, what is that? What's the shit?
What's the black stuff?

1:29:17.583 --> 1:29:20.916
Hey. Look-- All right.

1:29:21.791 --> 1:29:25.000
All right, hey, look,
don't-don't-don't check out on us.

1:29:25.291 --> 1:29:29.791
Keep it away from her.
Keep the Wand away from Leilah.

1:29:30.208 --> 1:29:31.583
-Promise me.
-Yes.

1:29:31.666 --> 1:29:34.666
All right. She needs medical attention.
We gotta get her to an emergency room.

1:29:35.250 --> 1:29:37.833
But how?

1:29:39.583 --> 1:29:40.750
Got it. Let's go!

1:29:41.333 --> 1:29:42.333
Go, go!

1:29:45.416 --> 1:29:46.666
We won't let you die.

1:29:47.291 --> 1:29:48.666
How do we save you?

1:29:49.625 --> 1:29:52.458
Only the Shield of Light can help me.

1:29:53.166 --> 1:29:54.375
Where are they?

1:29:54.750 --> 1:29:56.083
Home.

1:29:57.125 --> 1:29:59.125
- Home.
- Home? Where's home?

1:29:59.416 --> 1:30:02.416
Wait, home.
Uh... the Abrams' house?

1:30:03.208 --> 1:30:04.708
Everybody was dead there.

1:30:05.458 --> 1:30:07.375
There's a pool.

1:30:09.958 --> 1:30:13.666
The pools are... connected like...

1:30:14.666 --> 1:30:17.708
the roots of a holy tree.

1:30:19.916 --> 1:30:22.750
Ward, she's dying. We have to take her
back to where we found her.

1:30:22.833 --> 1:30:24.916
-No. We are not going back to that house.
-Yes.

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.666
We're gonna get to the hospital.
There's doctors there.

1:30:27.750 --> 1:30:30.291
We're gonna turn her and the Wand
over to the feds.

1:30:30.375 --> 1:30:32.000
-Ward. Ward.
-I want my life back.

1:30:32.083 --> 1:30:35.833
She brought me back from the dead.

1:30:35.916 --> 1:30:38.416
Hey, don't kook out on me right now,
all right?

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:40.583
We don't know exactly what happened.

1:30:40.666 --> 1:30:42.291
You have to accept the miracle.

1:30:42.375 --> 1:30:46.625
-We're not going back to that house.
-You and me are simple people.

1:30:47.083 --> 1:30:48.333
We mean nothing.

1:30:48.500 --> 1:30:50.333
People don't write about us.

1:30:50.458 --> 1:30:53.583
But this, don't you see,
is like a time of heroes?

1:30:53.875 --> 1:30:57.666
Jirak was unblooded like me.

1:30:57.750 --> 1:31:00.166
An Orc that nobody cared about.

1:31:00.875 --> 1:31:01.708
He...

1:31:02.625 --> 1:31:07.375
He united the Nine Armies,
and they defeated the Dark Lord. He...

1:31:07.541 --> 1:31:11.125
He was a farmer who changed the world.

1:31:12.875 --> 1:31:14.791
They raised their blades to him.

1:31:14.916 --> 1:31:17.833
He was blooded in that very moment.

1:31:18.958 --> 1:31:21.083
He fulfilled a great Prophecy, Ward.

1:31:22.875 --> 1:31:24.791
I think we might be in a Prophecy.

1:31:25.708 --> 1:31:28.625
-We're not in a Prophecy, all right?
-How do you know?

1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:31.416
We're in a stolen Toyota Corolla.

1:31:31.583 --> 1:31:34.250
-No.
-Okay? Look at my face.

1:31:34.583 --> 1:31:37.875
All right? This is not a Prophecy face.

1:31:37.958 --> 1:31:40.458
This is a bad-night face.

1:31:41.083 --> 1:31:43.250
Okay? And we're gonna get to the hospital,

1:31:43.333 --> 1:31:44.958
and the feds are gonna put an end to it.

1:31:45.041 --> 1:31:48.208
Shut the fuck up, Ward, and listen to me.

1:31:48.291 --> 1:31:49.750
We have to go back.

1:31:49.958 --> 1:31:51.625
There's nothing ahead of us.

1:32:08.666 --> 1:32:11.083
Ah, man. These guys are feds.

1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:12.541
Oh, shit.

1:32:43.083 --> 1:32:44.625
I get the big gun.

1:32:48.166 --> 1:32:49.083
Ah.

1:32:49.583 --> 1:32:51.708
I didn't mind having the big gun.

1:33:13.541 --> 1:33:15.083
That-- That's a bomb.

1:33:15.166 --> 1:33:16.000
Yes, it is.

1:33:17.083 --> 1:33:19.291
-You want me to hold it?
-Yes, I do.

1:33:19.375 --> 1:33:21.083
W... Why?

1:33:21.750 --> 1:33:22.708
You never know.

1:33:30.208 --> 1:33:34.416
I sit before you, Lord of Darkness.

1:33:34.500 --> 1:33:38.541
Serving your will is my honor.

1:33:38.625 --> 1:33:41.708
I will return you to this world.

1:33:43.750 --> 1:33:46.250
They're coming!
There! In the wall!

1:33:46.333 --> 1:33:47.458
Shoot through the wall!

1:33:51.291 --> 1:33:52.875
Ward!

1:34:09.541 --> 1:34:11.250
Nick!

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.458
Nick! Let's go!

1:34:19.666 --> 1:34:20.916
Jakoby!

1:34:34.250 --> 1:34:35.500
I gave her the bomb.

1:34:36.250 --> 1:34:37.166
You never know.

1:34:37.708 --> 1:34:38.625
Swipe left.

1:34:58.458 --> 1:34:59.541
Oh, shit.

1:35:43.875 --> 1:35:45.958
Shoot her!

1:35:47.958 --> 1:35:49.750
Shoot her!

1:35:49.833 --> 1:35:51.750
Nick, will you please shoot her!

1:35:51.833 --> 1:35:53.208
Shoot! Shoot her!

1:36:12.250 --> 1:36:13.083
Good work.

1:36:31.666 --> 1:36:35.750
The water. Put me in the water.

1:36:35.833 --> 1:36:39.375
Hey. You're done. I got it from here.

1:37:21.625 --> 1:37:22.875
So what now?

1:37:24.583 --> 1:37:26.125
Have faith.

1:37:39.708 --> 1:37:41.083
She's coming.

1:37:45.041 --> 1:37:45.875
Nick!

1:38:41.750 --> 1:38:43.041
The hell are you?

1:38:43.708 --> 1:38:44.958
I'm a warrior.

1:38:45.500 --> 1:38:47.458
A priestess, a lover.

1:38:48.208 --> 1:38:51.166
I am whatever my Lord needs me to be.

1:38:58.458 --> 1:39:00.083
Come home.

1:39:02.166 --> 1:39:04.041
Please, come home.

1:39:04.750 --> 1:39:07.416
I can't go back.

1:39:08.750 --> 1:39:11.250
Dream with me again.

1:39:12.500 --> 1:39:16.125
What you love is broken, rotten.

1:39:20.916 --> 1:39:23.208
This man and the Orc...

1:39:24.416 --> 1:39:26.333
...what are they to you?

1:39:28.458 --> 1:39:30.666
- They're good.
- No.

1:39:40.208 --> 1:39:43.125
It's time to come home.

1:39:44.750 --> 1:39:46.583
It's time to come home.

1:39:46.875 --> 1:39:50.916
- It's too late. I can't come home.
- It's time to wake up.

1:39:58.333 --> 1:40:01.500
So just shut up and kill me.

1:40:01.583 --> 1:40:03.500
Just shut up and kill me!

1:40:03.583 --> 1:40:06.000
- This is not you!
- Shut up and kill me!

1:40:06.083 --> 1:40:08.916
This is not you! This is you!

1:40:09.583 --> 1:40:12.375
What have you done to my sister?

1:40:12.958 --> 1:40:16.291
What have you done to her?
What did you do?

1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:27.375
Shit.

1:40:27.875 --> 1:40:31.541
Nick, if you were aiming at the Wand,
that was a really good shot.

1:40:31.625 --> 1:40:33.458
But shoot her in her head!

1:40:34.666 --> 1:40:35.541
Like this?

1:40:39.083 --> 1:40:40.083
I can't.

1:40:40.583 --> 1:40:42.416
I'm out.

1:40:48.041 --> 1:40:49.750
No!

1:40:50.666 --> 1:40:51.791
You're not a Bright.

1:40:53.250 --> 1:40:54.916
You touch my Wand...

1:40:55.416 --> 1:40:58.958
and it will splatter you
all over the walls.

1:40:59.875 --> 1:41:01.791
I think that's kind of the plan.

1:41:02.750 --> 1:41:04.333
Think I'mma just kill us all.

1:41:11.541 --> 1:41:12.541
Ward...

1:41:13.208 --> 1:41:14.583
I wouldn't do that.

1:41:15.083 --> 1:41:16.166
It's all right.

1:41:17.500 --> 1:41:19.041
We're in a Prophecy, right?

1:41:29.125 --> 1:41:31.125
Oh... Oh!

1:41:31.208 --> 1:41:32.875
This is impossible.

1:41:36.166 --> 1:41:38.916
Hey, Nick, I got the Wand.

1:41:39.083 --> 1:41:40.375
Um, what now?

1:41:40.458 --> 1:41:44.000
Maybe you're a-- You're a Bright, Ward.

1:41:46.166 --> 1:41:47.208
Use it!

1:41:47.583 --> 1:41:48.833
Oh, good idea.

1:41:49.958 --> 1:41:51.083
Give it to me...

1:41:54.500 --> 1:41:56.000
or she dies.

1:41:56.750 --> 1:41:58.375
Vykwarus.

1:41:59.333 --> 1:42:01.083
The war word is  Vykwarus.

1:42:01.333 --> 1:42:03.750
Vykwarus!

1:42:11.666 --> 1:42:13.208
We got a Bright in there!

1:42:19.208 --> 1:42:20.125
Aah!

1:42:24.041 --> 1:42:25.583
Tikka. Tikka.

1:42:28.333 --> 1:42:30.666
-Tikka!
-Ward! It's okay.

1:42:30.750 --> 1:42:32.666
-She just-- She rolled in.
-Come on, Ward!

1:42:32.750 --> 1:42:35.041
-She's gone. It's okay.
-I didn't hurt her.

1:42:35.125 --> 1:42:37.916
-Tikka!
-Ward, Tikka's okay.

1:42:38.166 --> 1:42:39.166
She's gone.

1:42:39.250 --> 1:42:41.250
-Tikka!
-Ward, think of Sophia.

1:42:41.333 --> 1:42:42.333
Come on, Ward!

1:42:58.791 --> 1:42:59.708
Orc!

1:43:00.708 --> 1:43:01.875
Stand down.

1:43:02.416 --> 1:43:03.541
Stand down.

1:43:03.625 --> 1:43:04.750
Ward!

1:43:07.083 --> 1:43:08.208
Ward!

1:43:09.125 --> 1:43:11.083
No!

1:43:11.166 --> 1:43:12.000
Daryl!

1:43:13.083 --> 1:43:14.208
You're safe now.

1:43:14.791 --> 1:43:17.125
Ward!

1:43:22.833 --> 1:43:24.041
Daryl!

1:43:28.583 --> 1:43:30.333
Ward!

1:43:31.041 --> 1:43:32.500
Ward!

1:43:53.875 --> 1:43:55.833
I know. I gotcha.

1:44:06.291 --> 1:44:07.375
Got him!

1:44:07.583 --> 1:44:10.000
Ward! We made it!

1:44:10.416 --> 1:44:11.583
We got out!

1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.666
I got you. You're okay.

1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:16.333
Are you okay?

1:44:16.416 --> 1:44:18.375
Breathe, Ward.

1:44:19.708 --> 1:44:20.875
Say something.

1:44:24.916 --> 1:44:27.916
Nick... look.

1:44:29.958 --> 1:44:30.875
Oh.

1:45:12.750 --> 1:45:15.166
Still not my friend.

1:45:18.625 --> 1:45:22.541
I never really liked you anyway.

1:45:24.250 --> 1:45:26.916
Think you're a big dog
now you're blooded, huh?

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.291
Yeah, pretty big.

1:45:31.583 --> 1:45:32.708
Hey, Nick.

1:45:33.750 --> 1:45:34.583
Yeah.

1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:36.916
Fuck magic.

1:45:38.166 --> 1:45:42.041
Well, I don't know.
I still think it's kinda cool.

1:45:45.958 --> 1:45:47.333
How you doing, fellas?

1:45:47.833 --> 1:45:49.791
- Good?
- Hey.

1:45:50.833 --> 1:45:53.416
Nick, the firemen are here.

1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:56.166
- We should've been firemen.
- Yeah.

1:45:56.708 --> 1:45:59.416
Hey, can I get a aspirin?

1:46:25.791 --> 1:46:27.250
Hey, Clan Blood.

1:46:27.958 --> 1:46:28.791
Daryl.

1:46:29.708 --> 1:46:31.083
Oh, Daryl.

1:46:31.666 --> 1:46:32.875
How are you feeling?

1:46:33.875 --> 1:46:35.166
You feeling okay?

1:46:38.291 --> 1:46:39.375
Uh, yeah.

1:46:39.458 --> 1:46:41.166
Okay, I get it.

1:46:44.666 --> 1:46:45.833
Oh, shit.

1:46:46.041 --> 1:46:47.541
Well, that can't be good.

1:46:47.750 --> 1:46:48.583
Yeah.

1:46:49.416 --> 1:46:50.833
Why you not locked up?

1:46:51.625 --> 1:46:54.750
I think they think
you're more dangerous than me.

1:46:57.125 --> 1:46:57.958
Hey.

1:47:00.208 --> 1:47:02.541
Don't say shit.

1:47:16.708 --> 1:47:19.625
- Sir, we were just responding to a call.
- Mmm.

1:47:19.708 --> 1:47:23.125
My partner and I, we--
But there was all this crazy magic stuff.

1:47:23.208 --> 1:47:25.208
I mean, everything that happened
with Brown...

1:47:25.291 --> 1:47:27.583
-Hey, hey, hey.
-...and Hicks and Pollard and Ching--

1:47:27.666 --> 1:47:30.166
-They wanted Officer Ward to shoot me.
-Hey. Nick.

1:47:30.250 --> 1:47:34.125
They wanted to him to kill me
so they could get the Wand, remember?

1:47:34.208 --> 1:47:36.458
And he wouldn't do it
'cause he's a stand-up guy.

1:47:36.541 --> 1:47:39.291
He wouldn't do it. But then they said
they would kill me, so he--

1:47:39.375 --> 1:47:40.875
he had to take action,

1:47:40.958 --> 1:47:43.583
-like, with his gun, right?
-No. That's not my recollection.

1:47:43.666 --> 1:47:45.458
Hey, Nick, why don't you just--

1:47:45.541 --> 1:47:46.583
If you hold up a second...

1:47:46.666 --> 1:47:49.125
-What?
-...they'll ask us questions.

1:47:49.208 --> 1:47:51.875
It's what happened, I swear to God.
We just returned to the call.

1:47:51.958 --> 1:47:55.666
But there are forces at play
that are beyond.

1:47:55.750 --> 1:47:57.625
-There was, uh, an Elf woman.
-Hey, Nick.

1:47:57.708 --> 1:47:59.250
She owned the Wand. Right?

1:47:59.333 --> 1:48:02.625
It must've been hers. Not a nice lady.
Dressed very well, but-- Like you.

1:48:02.708 --> 1:48:05.041
But she was a terrible woman. She--

1:48:05.125 --> 1:48:07.500
-Uh, she served the Dark Lord.
-Nick--

1:48:07.583 --> 1:48:08.666
-I know it.
-Let them--

1:48:08.750 --> 1:48:11.083
-Let them ask us questions.
-They need to know this.

1:48:11.166 --> 1:48:13.458
-Let him ask us questions.
-There was an Angel.

1:48:13.541 --> 1:48:16.291
All right. That was then
when the gangsters were chasing us.

1:48:16.375 --> 1:48:19.416
- Uh, the context is a little off.
- Tikka.

1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:21.458
Oh, Tikka.

1:48:21.541 --> 1:48:24.375
So sad. Tikka--
Tikka was a young Bright.

1:48:24.458 --> 1:48:25.833
She-- She-- She--

1:48:26.208 --> 1:48:29.583
She-- She used the Wand
and she saved my life.

1:48:29.708 --> 1:48:34.833
I was-- My soul was leaving my body,
and she brought me back.

1:48:37.083 --> 1:48:37.916
Officer Ward?

1:48:38.333 --> 1:48:40.708
We responded to a 415 disturbance call.

1:48:41.208 --> 1:48:45.541
Uh, upon approaching the residence,
we realized that it was a safe house

1:48:45.625 --> 1:48:48.833
-for an extremist group.
-Full of weird--

1:48:48.916 --> 1:48:50.833
We immediately took fire,

1:48:51.208 --> 1:48:53.791
uh, at which point we called for backup.

1:48:54.208 --> 1:48:56.750
And... unfortunately...

1:48:57.291 --> 1:49:01.750
-officers were killed in the exchange.
-I've never seen shooting like it.

1:49:01.833 --> 1:49:03.791
He turned around, sight unseen,

1:49:03.875 --> 1:49:06.916
four of them, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Dropped...

1:49:07.708 --> 1:49:09.375
like it was one bullet.

1:49:09.458 --> 1:49:10.833
Sorry, keep going.

1:49:12.208 --> 1:49:14.458
Gangsters showed up,

1:49:14.541 --> 1:49:17.750
and it just went really sideways
from that point.

1:49:17.833 --> 1:49:19.875
And had you guys not shown up...

1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:23.708
it would've-- it would've been really bad.

1:49:23.958 --> 1:49:26.875
Uh, so the real heroes in this
are you guys.

1:49:27.416 --> 1:49:29.041
So we wanna say thank you.

1:49:29.166 --> 1:49:32.791
Nick, thank the nice federal agents.

1:49:34.625 --> 1:49:35.541
Thank you.

1:49:36.041 --> 1:49:40.041
So, let me say, unequivocally...

1:49:40.958 --> 1:49:45.000
there was no Wand.

1:49:46.375 --> 1:49:49.125
And there was no magic.

1:49:49.208 --> 1:49:51.333
Just a couple of street cops...

1:49:52.416 --> 1:49:53.833
doing our job.

1:49:55.583 --> 1:49:57.583
Oh, I know what this is.

1:49:58.875 --> 1:50:00.416
Then that's what happened?

1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.166
Yes, sir. That's exactly what happened.

1:50:03.750 --> 1:50:04.666
Yes?

1:50:04.750 --> 1:50:06.291
No, I'm with him.

1:50:07.916 --> 1:50:10.125
Unequivocally.

1:50:10.458 --> 1:50:14.625
Faced with armed terrorists obsessed
with myths from thousands of years ago,

1:50:15.041 --> 1:50:17.166
two of our officers held the line.

1:50:17.791 --> 1:50:21.000
I hate seeing those scumbags
up there with Rodriguez.

1:50:21.583 --> 1:50:23.041
Let it go, Ward.

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.291
We know, okay? That's enough.

1:50:27.375 --> 1:50:32.250
Officer Daryl Ward, and our nation's first
Orkish police officer, Nicholas Jakoby.

1:50:34.250 --> 1:50:35.166
Officer Jakoby.

1:50:46.416 --> 1:50:47.541
Congratulations, Ward.
