20:12.111 --> 20:13.670
My journey was over,

20:13.671 --> 20:16.308
and it wasn't the ending
that I had hoped for.

20:16.309 --> 20:19.443
So I went back to the place
where it all began.

20:19.444 --> 20:24.877
And suddenly, it was all so clear.

20:24.878 --> 20:25.941
My whole life,

20:25.942 --> 20:28.988
all I ever wanted
was to live in "The Far Side."

20:28.989 --> 20:30.925
I thought that by meeting Gary Larson,

20:30.926 --> 20:33.357
I'd be one step closer.

20:35.154 --> 20:37.373
But if I've learned anything
from "The Far Side",

20:37.374 --> 20:39.551
it's that life is absurd

20:39.552 --> 20:42.952
and it's not always
supposed to make sense.

20:42.953 --> 20:47.568
So in a way, bynotmeeting Gary Larson,

20:47.569 --> 20:50.306
I'm actually closer
to "The Far Side" than ever.

20:50.307 --> 20:51.736
♪♪

20:51.737 --> 20:54.228
Gary may have created "The Far Side",

20:54.229 --> 20:55.835
but by making this film,

20:55.836 --> 20:58.431
I'm the one who discovered
its true meaning.

20:58.432 --> 21:01.615
And now, I'm sharing it with all of you,

21:01.616 --> 21:03.445
especially my wonderful family

21:03.446 --> 21:05.955
who were so supportive of this journey.

21:05.956 --> 21:08.766
So welcome to "The Far Side."

21:08.767 --> 21:11.628
Gary and I will see you around.
