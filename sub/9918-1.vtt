00:43.336 --> 00:47.966
<i>No land more beautiful in this time</i>

00:48.174 --> 00:52.804
<i>Than ours here, whether far or near...</i>

00:55.473 --> 00:57.016
Don't worry.

00:57.642 --> 01:00.228
Adenauer will handle it. He's the captain.

01:00.395 --> 01:01.479
Am I right?

01:03.648 --> 01:06.234
I have two troublemakers in 6b.

01:06.401 --> 01:10.238
I've never seen anything like it.
Completely wild.

01:10.405 --> 01:12.657
And the parents won't do anything.

01:12.824 --> 01:14.993
That's the way it is nowadays.

01:18.496 --> 01:19.998
Hi there, pal.

01:20.665 --> 01:22.208
Need a light?

01:25.628 --> 01:27.797
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:39.434 --> 01:43.396
LABYRINTH OF LIES

01:52.697 --> 01:54.532
Public Prosecutor's Office

01:54.699 --> 01:55.700
<i>Your Honor,</i>

01:56.242 --> 02:00.205
according to paragraph 2,
section 2 of our Constitution,

02:00.371 --> 02:02.874
human life is the highest inalienable right.

02:03.708 --> 02:05.919
<i>The prosecution is convinced</i>

02:06.544 --> 02:09.255
that the accused
acted maliciously and on base motives,

02:09.422 --> 02:12.550
the preconditions for paragraph 211, murder.

02:13.218 --> 02:18.681
<i>I cannot see a justification for
the defense's plea of acting under duress.</i>

02:18.765 --> 02:22.227
Therefore, the prosecution
requests the maximum sentence,

02:22.393 --> 02:24.270
life imprisonment.

02:26.815 --> 02:28.817
- Morning, Radmann.
- Morning.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.735
How have the first weeks been?

02:30.902 --> 02:32.737
Very exciting.

02:32.904 --> 02:35.156
I'm only dealing with traffic violations.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.783
We all had to do it.

02:37.283 --> 02:40.912
Give it one or two years
and you'll get to do the proper stuff.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.625
Great.

02:46.584 --> 02:50.171
<i>...as it stands,
women are still only allowed to work</i>

02:50.338 --> 02:52.507
<i>with their husband's permission.</i>

02:52.590 --> 02:54.592
<i>And now, Vico Torriani.</i>

02:54.968 --> 02:57.345
Always do the right thing
Your father

03:33.464 --> 03:35.508
Mr. Prosecutor, how nice of you to drop by.

03:35.967 --> 03:38.344
- I apologize.
- We've started without you.

03:38.511 --> 03:42.223
The defendant, Marlene Wondrak,
admits the offense,

03:42.390 --> 03:45.643
but cannot afford the fine
of 50 deutschmarks.

03:45.810 --> 03:50.231
It was my boss' car. She mustn't find out,
and I only have 30 marks.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.736
- Mr. Radmann.
- Yes?

03:54.903 --> 03:59.324
With the prosecution's consent, we will
reduce the fine to 25 deutschmarks.

04:00.241 --> 04:04.746
And you promise you'll use your pretty
little head to concentrate on traffic,

04:04.913 --> 04:07.165
if you absolutely have to drive a car.

04:07.332 --> 04:08.750
All agreed?

04:10.627 --> 04:11.753
No.

04:12.712 --> 04:13.838
Come again?

04:14.172 --> 04:18.760
The law determines the amount of the fine.
There are no grounds for an exception.

04:18.927 --> 04:20.595
But I told you I don't have it.

04:20.762 --> 04:22.889
The law doesn't allow for this.

04:23.056 --> 04:27.352
You stickler, you monster!
You want to send me to jail for three days?

04:27.518 --> 04:29.187
No, but...

04:32.231 --> 04:35.693
So, Mr. Prosecutor, what are we going to do?

04:39.072 --> 04:42.116
There, I've paid.
Can I go now or must I still go to jail?

04:42.283 --> 04:45.036
Don't think I'm grateful to you.
You'll get it back.

04:45.203 --> 04:46.746
When I have it.

04:46.913 --> 04:48.748
What an impossible person!

04:48.915 --> 04:51.250
Damn it, she's got some spunk.

05:02.428 --> 05:05.556
It's a scandal, an outrageous scandal!

05:05.723 --> 05:08.559
There's a murderer on the loose out there.

05:08.768 --> 05:10.812
Mr. Kirsch here recognized the man.

05:10.979 --> 05:14.899
We've tried three police stations,
but none of them were interested.

05:15.066 --> 05:16.943
Good day, Mr. Gnielka.

05:19.237 --> 05:22.407
Desperate to find a story
for the <i>Rundschau</i> again?

05:22.573 --> 05:24.909
I already have the story, Chief Prosecutor.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.744
There's a murderer out there,

05:26.911 --> 05:29.163
a former member
of the Waffen-SS at Auschwitz.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.500
He now teaches children. Interested?

05:32.667 --> 05:36.254
You really are a magnificent hothead.

05:36.462 --> 05:38.256
I want to leave now, Gnielka.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.591
This is just pointless.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.020
Alois Schulz, Unterscharführer
in the Waffen-SS,

05:52.186 --> 05:54.605
now teaches at the Goethe School.
Interested?

05:55.606 --> 05:57.025
You?

05:58.276 --> 05:59.485
You?

06:03.531 --> 06:04.532
Out!

06:08.119 --> 06:11.039
Come on, Simon, let's go.
Before I have to puke.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.626
Throw this away.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.880
Show is over, gentlemen. Back to work.

06:40.526 --> 06:44.405
- Where is the school board, Schmittchen?
- At the Römer.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.074
I'm sensing something.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.034
And I don't like it.

07:10.848 --> 07:13.726
- Eintracht will win the league.
-If Egon stays fit.

07:13.893 --> 07:18.898
I checked out the records on this Schulz.
The years from '39 to '45 are missing.

07:19.065 --> 07:20.108
On who?

07:20.274 --> 07:22.860
That teacher the journalist talked about.

07:25.029 --> 07:27.115
Well, someone's ambitious here.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.618
After '45 the US confiscated
truckloads of documents.

07:31.202 --> 07:34.038
The denazification by the Allies is a fact.

07:34.205 --> 07:36.749
Gnielka has no loyalty to the fatherland.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.211
Don't be fooled.

07:58.938 --> 08:00.773
Excuse me, the document center?

08:00.940 --> 08:02.942
- Second floor.
- Thank you.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.781
Sorry, but the document center
isn't open to the public.

08:08.948 --> 08:10.825
I'm researching this person's past.

08:10.992 --> 08:14.078
He teaches children.
I need to know what he did in the war.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.247
He was a Nazi.

08:16.414 --> 08:18.082
You were all Nazis,

08:18.249 --> 08:21.335
just like in the Eastern Sector,
suddenly you're all Communists.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.337
Jeez, you Germans!

08:24.255 --> 08:28.426
If little green men landed from Mars,
suddenly you'd all be little green men.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.429
Kid, you're too young.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.764
But your father was a Nazi.

08:33.931 --> 08:37.143
What? No. He hated the Nazis.

08:37.309 --> 08:41.772
Yeah, sure. Everyone became
a resistance fighter after '45.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.817
And you are here by which authority?

08:47.111 --> 08:49.530
Public Prosecutor's Office, Frankfurt.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.367
Good morning.

09:34.533 --> 09:35.701
Good morning.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.914
Therefore I shall request
a three-year sentence.

09:40.081 --> 09:41.874
Good work, Haller.

09:42.041 --> 09:47.004
If you have nothing else, Attorney General,
I'll close this meeting.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.091
Chief Prosecutor.

09:50.925 --> 09:53.010
Yes, Mr. Radmann?

09:53.177 --> 09:55.721
- This teacher, Mr. Schulz...
- Which Schulz?

09:55.888 --> 09:57.431
Mr. Gnielka's matter.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.850
I beg your pardon?

10:00.017 --> 10:03.521
I did some research.
Schulz was indeed in the Waffen-SS.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.943
He didn't disclose this
when he was employed in 1947.

10:10.528 --> 10:13.739
He's not allowed to work as a teacher.
I wrote a report.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.574
Let's have a look.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.380
Yes, interesting.

10:29.547 --> 10:32.883
You know what?
I'll forward this to the Ministry of Education.

10:33.384 --> 10:36.429
Gentlemen, same time next Wednesday.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.899
Your mother left this for you.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.985
- What? When?
- Just now.

10:51.152 --> 10:54.655
She wanted to wait, but your father
outside was honking impatiently.

10:54.822 --> 10:55.990
That's how men are!

10:57.116 --> 10:59.410
That's not my father.

11:01.579 --> 11:04.498
He's been missing since '45. Eastern front.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.751
I'm sorry.

11:12.006 --> 11:15.009
- He didn't really say that!
- Scout's honor.

11:15.176 --> 11:16.594
Mr. Gnielka.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.263
- Do you remember? You...
- I know who you are.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.265
I took care of that Schulz matter.

11:21.432 --> 11:23.351
The ministry has suspended him.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.270
Suspended?

11:27.605 --> 11:30.274
What do you accuse him of?
Who do you think he killed?

11:30.441 --> 11:33.694
He was stationed at Auschwitz.
Don't you know what that means?

11:33.861 --> 11:36.364
Wasn't it a protective custody camp?

11:36.530 --> 11:41.035
Believe me, no one was protected there.
I can't believe this.

11:41.202 --> 11:42.203
Watch this.

11:42.370 --> 11:44.872
Ever heard of Auschwitz, darling?

11:45.039 --> 11:46.624
- No.
- That is what's scandalous.

11:47.792 --> 11:50.628
- Ever heard of Auschwitz?
- No, and I'm busy.

11:51.921 --> 11:53.881
- How old are you?
-20.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.634
- And you've never heard of Auschwitz?
- No.

11:57.510 --> 12:02.014
Mankind's biggest atrocity
is simply denied and forgotten.

12:02.181 --> 12:03.974
What are you talking about?

12:05.059 --> 12:10.064
A German prosecutor not knowing
what happened at Auschwitz is a disgrace.

12:12.691 --> 12:16.404
And if this Schulz has been suspended,
I'll eat my hat.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.997
We don't have any guidebooks on Poland.

12:27.164 --> 12:29.083
No one ever goes there.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.709
And as to this...

12:30.876 --> 12:33.003
- Auschwitz.
- That's it, Auschwitz.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.339
There are two books on it.

12:35.506 --> 12:38.509
One is out of print,
the other should be in Kassel.

12:38.676 --> 12:40.177
- Shall I order it?
- Please.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.346
It will take eight to ten weeks.

13:07.163 --> 13:08.747
Yes, can I help you?

13:19.383 --> 13:22.219
Chief Prosecutor, may I have a word?

13:22.386 --> 13:25.639
Magnificent, I would like one of those.

13:27.475 --> 13:28.476
What's up?

13:28.642 --> 13:31.729
Schulz is still teaching.
I went to the Goethe School.

13:31.896 --> 13:35.441
There was a shortage of teachers.
It's a matter for the ministry.

13:35.608 --> 13:38.819
It's beyond my authority,
and definitely beyond yours.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.071
But Schulz was stationed at Auschwitz.

13:41.238 --> 13:44.241
They all had those camps.
The Americans, the Russians.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.494
I myself spent a year in a French one.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.289
Don't tell my wife,
but their cooking was better than hers.

13:53.751 --> 13:56.837
I was forced
to watch a film about it after the war.

13:57.004 --> 14:00.007
It's all propaganda.
The victors get to make up stories.

14:00.174 --> 14:04.303
That's what happens when you lose a war.
But why start digging now?

14:07.598 --> 14:09.433
Hi there. You were right.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.978
- What do you mean?
- That teacher is still teaching.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.314
Well, what can you do?

14:18.984 --> 14:21.695
That reporter was waiting for you
in your office.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.531
What a funny guy.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.467
"Young and ambitious prosecutor Radmann

14:43.634 --> 14:47.721
"researched the past
of senior teacher Schulz.

14:47.888 --> 14:51.475
"The Ministry of Education
was already informed on March 25th

14:51.642 --> 14:55.312
"and has been ignoring his Waffen-SS
membership for six weeks."

14:55.479 --> 14:57.648
And so on... "Outrageous scandal."

14:58.816 --> 14:59.817
Oh, boy.

15:00.651 --> 15:03.529
I wouldn't want to be
in your shoes right now.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.490
The Attorney General wants to see you.

15:08.659 --> 15:11.704
Mr. Radmann, the article
contains internal information.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.038
Did you pass this on?

15:14.415 --> 15:15.833
No.

15:21.422 --> 15:25.509
- But why didn't the ministry take action?
- Don't be so naive.

15:26.176 --> 15:30.514
Do you think all Nazis vanished
into thin air after Hitler's death?

15:30.681 --> 15:33.225
I can assure you they did not.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.358
They did not.

15:43.444 --> 15:45.946
But he can't be allowed to teach children.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.866
What we should do is put the man on trial.

15:49.074 --> 15:55.039
But having been stationed at this camp is
no criminal offense according to our law.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.707
Shameful as it is.

15:56.874 --> 16:00.127
And any crimes would have been
time-barred three years ago.

16:00.294 --> 16:02.087
Except for murder.

16:02.212 --> 16:05.215
But do we have one? An actual murder?

16:05.549 --> 16:07.384
Is there an actual victim?

16:07.593 --> 16:09.720
Open your eyes, Mr. Radmann.

16:10.387 --> 16:13.932
The public sector is full of Nazis,
big ones as well as little ones.

16:14.016 --> 16:16.602
And none of them has anything to fear.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.737
Latest evening edition!

16:26.904 --> 16:30.157
Evening edition!
Khrushchev renews ultimatum!

16:30.324 --> 16:34.453
Report on the anniversary of Hiroshima!

16:37.748 --> 16:39.083
Have you lost your mind?

16:39.249 --> 16:40.334
The article was a hit.

16:40.501 --> 16:43.671
- I'll sue you for stealing the file.
- I'm quaking in my boots.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.007
You nearly had me fired.
You should be ashamed!

16:47.174 --> 16:50.928
I'd be ashamed if I didn't make
this kind of story public.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.683
I just don't get it.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.434
How can all this be kept secret?

16:57.601 --> 17:00.938
How? Easy!
They all did the same thing Schulz did.

17:01.105 --> 17:05.192
They came home, hung up their uniforms
and carried on as if nothing had happened.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.362
No one asks questions
because no one wants to know.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.699
Are you free tonight? I'm sorry.

17:11.865 --> 17:15.202
Reporters sometimes bend the rules.
Not to worry.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.954
Come by.

17:17.121 --> 17:19.373
There'll be pretty girls, sausages, beer.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.666
Not necessarily in that order.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.191
Typical male. They need water.

17:46.859 --> 17:49.653
I'm Inge. The beer is back there.

17:49.820 --> 17:50.988
Thanks.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.058
She has class, hasn't she?

18:21.560 --> 18:23.020
Come, I'll introduce you.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.439
I can do that myself.

18:26.565 --> 18:30.944
Ladies and gents, friends and combatants,
I've discovered a rare specimen.

18:31.111 --> 18:36.241
An attorney whose armored chest still
contains a delicate flicker of humanity.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.869
- So you're a poet after all.
- Thanks, Simon.

18:39.036 --> 18:41.914
Please make him feel welcome
in our anarchic circle,

18:42.080 --> 18:45.751
so that the flicker
may eventually become a raging flame.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.901
That was theft, wasn't it?
Are you going to arrest me?

19:11.068 --> 19:14.571
Petty larceny.
I'll put you behind bars for six weeks.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.406
You wretched man.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.283
Are you always like this?

19:19.493 --> 19:21.245
Why don't you find out?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.497
Maybe I will.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.257
You're suffocating.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.479
- Someone needs to take Simon home.
- I'll drive.

20:29.646 --> 20:30.856
You're drunk.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.399
I can drive.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.820
Nice people, aren't they?

20:36.987 --> 20:38.906
I saw it straightaway.

20:39.573 --> 20:41.074
What do you mean?

20:42.326 --> 20:47.164
She's a cutie, a dame,
a doll face, a sugar babe.

20:47.331 --> 20:49.708
And Marlene likes you, Radmann.

20:57.341 --> 20:59.259
And he was actually imprisoned there?

21:00.010 --> 21:02.012
Yes, but he doesn't talk about it.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.579
<i>The Angel of Death.</i>

21:28.080 --> 21:30.958
The first painting he did after Auschwitz.

21:32.459 --> 21:36.838
Would you believe it, he's entitled
to compensation, but he doesn't want it.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.466
Because of that damned claim form.

21:39.633 --> 21:42.469
Those idiots want proof
that he was at Auschwitz.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.262
Is there anything I can do?

21:48.225 --> 21:49.851
Yes, give me a hand.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.399
There must be something here.

21:56.566 --> 21:57.943
Nothing.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.611
Get this suitcase down.

21:59.778 --> 22:01.446
But I can't just...

22:17.337 --> 22:19.297
No, let me do that.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.685
Jackpot

22:40.944 --> 22:42.779
What are you doing?

22:44.406 --> 22:45.907
We're helping you.

22:45.991 --> 22:47.117
How dare you?

22:47.284 --> 22:48.493
Simon.

22:48.618 --> 22:51.371
I don't want your help.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.374
You have no right to go through my things.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.834
- Simon...
- Out. Out!

22:56.793 --> 22:57.794
Out!

22:58.170 --> 22:59.171
Out!

23:00.797 --> 23:02.466
He's stubborn.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.053
But maybe these contain something.

23:06.136 --> 23:09.931
- So you learned something after all.
- I'll return them, of course.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.310
Nothing in here.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.895
Nothing in here either.

23:15.520 --> 23:19.107
This one has an Auschwitz
concentration camp letterhead.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.240
Have a look at this.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.119
"Shot while trying to escape."

23:31.203 --> 23:32.245
So?

23:33.330 --> 23:36.124
"Shot while trying to escape" means murder.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.252
And here it lists the names of the murderers.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.381
Order reigns supreme. Unbelievable, isn't it?

23:45.217 --> 23:46.760
Come with me.

23:50.764 --> 23:53.600
Sorry to disturb you,
but I think it's important.

23:54.935 --> 23:58.563
These are official lists
of the Auschwitz camp administration.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.108
The names of SS men who shot prisoners.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.735
Look, "Schmidt, Milde, Siebert..."

24:04.528 --> 24:08.365
That's what you wanted.
This is proof, isn't it?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.493
Come in.

24:26.174 --> 24:27.551
Where did you get this?

24:29.511 --> 24:31.096
From an Auschwitz survivor.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.726
Good.

24:38.770 --> 24:41.064
It's a start.

24:42.065 --> 24:43.233
- How?
- What?

24:43.650 --> 24:48.071
These are concrete criminal offenses,
perpetrators, victims, times.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.282
The prosecutor can act on this.

24:50.448 --> 24:51.908
So we'll investigate them?

24:52.075 --> 24:55.328
Why investigate?
That's nitpicking. Here are the names.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.747
These murderers must be arrested.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.332
Don't be silly, Mr. Gnielka.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.626
That alone won't be enough.

25:01.793 --> 25:06.464
Attorney General, if at all possible,
I would like to be involved.

25:07.591 --> 25:09.092
I would like to help.

25:09.301 --> 25:11.553
You won't help, Mr. Radmann.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.766
You will lead the investigations.

25:21.104 --> 25:23.982
And no more articles for the time being.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.193
Unless you want to warn the perpetrators.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.278
Agreed.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.115
Gentlemen,

25:32.282 --> 25:37.204
if we succeed in ultimately
charging these men in Germany,

25:37.787 --> 25:40.707
that would be quite extraordinary.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.089
Schmittchen!

25:53.929 --> 25:56.097
- What is it?
- No more traffic violations.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.141
The start of a new life.

26:09.819 --> 26:13.073
- I don't know what you want.
- We took some documents from you.

26:13.657 --> 26:16.660
There was a list.
I need to know where you got it from.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.453
Was it in my suitcase?

26:21.164 --> 26:23.166
I've no idea.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.336
The liberation was chaotic,
we grabbed what we could.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.129
Why do you want to know?

26:28.922 --> 26:31.508
I'm investigating the crimes at Auschwitz.

26:31.675 --> 26:35.595
You were there. Did you witness
criminal offenses during your stay?

26:36.304 --> 26:38.306
My "stay"?

26:38.473 --> 26:40.433
What did this Schulz do?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.852
He was a regular SS swine.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.021
But did you see him killing anyone?

26:46.940 --> 26:48.358
No.

26:51.111 --> 26:54.364
I need witnesses, Mr. Kirsch.
You need to give a statement.

26:54.531 --> 26:55.782
What for?

26:55.949 --> 26:57.450
Just look around.

26:57.867 --> 27:01.788
Petticoats in pink and baby blue.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.582
This country wants sugar-coating.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.876
It doesn't want to know the truth.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.881
Please let me get on with my work.

27:26.563 --> 27:29.983
These are the names
of the suspects we are after, Officer.

27:30.066 --> 27:32.360
You must find out their whereabouts.

27:32.652 --> 27:36.156
So, to summarize, they were at this camp
in Poland during the war,

27:36.323 --> 27:39.576
and the police
should find them for killing people?

27:40.243 --> 27:42.412
But they were soldiers?

27:42.579 --> 27:44.748
Wasn't that their duty?

27:55.925 --> 27:57.260
I'll be in touch.

28:03.516 --> 28:04.601
Good morning.

28:04.768 --> 28:08.563
Who's going to prosecute
the parking offenders now, Radmann?

28:16.696 --> 28:20.950
First: Addresses? Still alive?

28:36.299 --> 28:39.969
"You incur a speeding fine. Pay 100 marks."

28:40.136 --> 28:43.139
- Inge, lend your husband 100 marks.
- Serves you right.

28:43.306 --> 28:44.891
But I'm broke. Radmann.

28:45.058 --> 28:46.142
Then you lose.

28:46.309 --> 28:47.977
The prosecutor shows no mercy.

28:48.144 --> 28:51.481
- Some people must be punished.
- Sure, and all of them by you.

28:51.648 --> 28:52.816
Only the ones I catch.

28:52.982 --> 28:55.110
Who hears my plea and lends me some cash?

28:55.276 --> 28:59.322
I'll build a house on Goethe Street
and open my own fashion studio.

28:59.489 --> 29:02.992
Then I can stop sewing curtains
for Mrs. Brettschneider. Great!

29:03.660 --> 29:04.994
Oh, no!

29:05.662 --> 29:07.497
That's justice for you.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.297
Everything's fine, children.

29:31.146 --> 29:33.523
Show yourselves, you dirty cowards!

29:33.690 --> 29:35.358
You won't shut me up!

29:35.567 --> 29:38.862
- I write what I want about who I want!
- Thomas, are you crazy?

29:39.028 --> 29:40.613
Gnielka, please!

29:45.785 --> 29:48.204
I told you the article was a hit.

29:50.373 --> 29:53.460
Do you understand now?
They're still everywhere.

30:06.639 --> 30:10.810
I need the addresses of the survivors.
They are important witnesses.

30:11.519 --> 30:15.315
You pay them compensation,
so you should have their addresses.

30:16.065 --> 30:19.027
No, we'll pick them up ourselves, then.

30:19.194 --> 30:20.820
Yes. Good bye.

30:23.239 --> 30:25.909
Schmittchen, take a dictation, please.

30:26.075 --> 30:29.829
Hermann Langbein leads
the association of Auschwitz survivors.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.664
Please send him a telegram.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.542
Dear Mr. Langbein...

30:41.841 --> 30:43.676
- Mr. Langbein.
- Mr. Radmann.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.428
Thanks for coming.

30:46.262 --> 30:47.931
Where's the witness?

30:49.349 --> 30:51.267
Mr. Bichinsky, what's keeping you?

30:55.230 --> 30:57.273
Schmittchen, our first witness.

31:00.193 --> 31:02.946
Mr. Bichinsky, you were detained
at Auschwitz for two years.

31:03.446 --> 31:06.950
Yes, I was there from August 1943

31:07.116 --> 31:10.245
until the Russians liberated us
in January 1945.

31:17.752 --> 31:19.546
Just carry on, please.

31:28.429 --> 31:31.474
Do you recognize the names on this list?

31:37.146 --> 31:39.065
No.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.735
- Not a single one? Are you sure?
- Yes.

31:47.657 --> 31:51.995
Can you testify to the fact
that crimes were committed in the camp?

31:52.161 --> 31:53.246
Yes, I can.

31:54.998 --> 31:58.501
Hundreds of thousands were killed there.

32:12.432 --> 32:16.769
Well, we would need
the names of the victims.

32:22.775 --> 32:23.943
Didn't you hear?

32:24.110 --> 32:25.945
Hundreds of thousands, it was a factory.

32:26.070 --> 32:28.531
How is he supposed to know the names?

32:30.450 --> 32:31.659
All right.

32:34.162 --> 32:36.956
Then we'll write "victims unknown."

32:39.042 --> 32:42.629
My wife and my son were murdered there.

32:47.175 --> 32:48.676
I'm sorry.

32:56.809 --> 33:01.356
Can you tell me the date
when this happened?

33:02.065 --> 33:05.735
The SS didn't give us a calendar...

33:07.737 --> 33:10.073
What do you think Auschwitz was like?

33:11.157 --> 33:13.368
A little summer camp by a lake?

33:15.078 --> 33:17.747
Mr. Bauer, what kind of greenhorn is this?

33:23.461 --> 33:25.463
Can I talk to you for a minute?

33:26.547 --> 33:29.550
Would you like some coffee?
Schmittchen, coffee, please.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.427
We'll be back shortly.

33:36.432 --> 33:38.518
We can't investigate only that list.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.603
What do you suggest?

33:42.605 --> 33:46.734
I'll ask Bichinsky what he has seen.
Actual crimes he can testify to.

33:46.984 --> 33:50.947
This means that all SS men
who served at Auschwitz are suspects.

33:52.448 --> 33:55.243
- All of them.
- I'm aware of that.

33:55.410 --> 33:58.246
I want to know what happened there.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.223
Mr. Radmann...

34:17.806 --> 34:19.934
This is a labyrinth.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.145
Don't lose yourself in it.

34:31.320 --> 34:35.199
Mr. Bichinsky, please tell me
everything you experienced.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.368
Where should he start?

34:39.829 --> 34:41.456
At the beginning.

35:37.637 --> 35:38.638
What did he do?

35:39.013 --> 35:42.642
Hans Brandner hit my witness
with his whip until he passed out.

35:42.725 --> 35:44.393
My witness lost his right eye.

35:45.061 --> 35:47.146
And you know why Brandner did it?

35:48.147 --> 35:52.235
Because my witness dared
to glance at him during roll call.

35:58.741 --> 36:01.160
- And now we'll arrest him.
- What? No.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.246
- Why not?
- We have no charge.

36:03.371 --> 36:04.997
- But...
- There was no murder.

36:05.081 --> 36:07.416
Everything else is time-barred.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.253
So what are we doing here?

36:10.419 --> 36:12.255
I must look at him.

36:13.422 --> 36:14.841
I must see what he's like.

36:15.550 --> 36:17.760
- Thanks.
- You'll be as pretty as your mom.

36:17.927 --> 36:20.429
You're a charmer, Mr. Brandner.

36:20.596 --> 36:22.098
I see.

36:24.517 --> 36:25.768
Wait.

36:29.689 --> 36:31.190
- Mr. Brandner?
- Yes?

36:32.275 --> 36:33.860
I think we know each other.

36:34.777 --> 36:36.195
I can't remember.

36:36.362 --> 36:37.947
I'm certain.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.448
I never forget a face.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.953
I don't know.
You're not from around here, are you?

36:45.121 --> 36:48.291
Try one of these. You won't find any better.

36:49.584 --> 36:51.460
I've got to start my delivery.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.424
Come on.

37:09.312 --> 37:12.648
Get my robe, Schmittchen, hurry!

37:15.985 --> 37:17.612
Please stay seated.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.823
How do you expect this to work?

37:21.449 --> 37:25.328
You want to fly in people from Poland,
Israel and God knows where.

37:25.453 --> 37:28.581
We don't even have diplomatic ties
with these countries.

37:28.748 --> 37:30.082
And what for?

37:30.249 --> 37:34.337
To prove that someone did something
somewhere in Poland during the war.

37:34.503 --> 37:38.341
These people are witnesses
to thousands of murder cases.

37:38.507 --> 37:41.844
Murder? Be realistic. Where is the intent?

37:42.011 --> 37:46.098
We didn't have any choice.
Whoever refused was killed.

37:46.557 --> 37:49.936
Besides, all this was dealt with
at Nuremberg after the war.

37:50.353 --> 37:53.272
Only 150 men were convicted at Nuremberg.

37:54.273 --> 37:58.861
By the Allies, not by the German
justice system. So this isn't settled yet.

37:59.028 --> 38:03.783
I'm sorry, Chief Prosecutor, I thought
your court session was in the afternoon.

38:04.367 --> 38:05.868
It would be the first time

38:06.035 --> 38:10.498
that a country charges its own soldiers
for their actions during a war.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.541
It's a non-starter.

38:16.212 --> 38:17.463
You know what?

38:18.047 --> 38:20.091
I love this country.

38:20.174 --> 38:21.842
I still do.

38:22.093 --> 38:24.095
In spite of everything.

38:24.178 --> 38:26.347
It had to endure so much.

38:27.390 --> 38:30.059
All you will achieve
is re-opening old wounds

38:30.142 --> 38:32.478
that were just starting to heal.

38:38.901 --> 38:40.903
Did you know that Bauer is a Jew?

38:41.237 --> 38:43.698
He himself was in a camp in 1933.

38:43.990 --> 38:46.158
He probably never got over that.

39:04.343 --> 39:06.429
- Take it easy, Toni!
- Lenchen!

39:09.348 --> 39:11.100
Toni, I told you to take it easy!

39:11.267 --> 39:12.935
No harm done.

39:16.772 --> 39:20.735
Daddy, this is Johann Radmann.
He took me home after the movies.

39:20.901 --> 39:23.029
Very pleased to meet you.

39:24.030 --> 39:27.116
- Come on, I'll fix you dinner.
- Thanks, Lenchen.

39:41.088 --> 39:43.466
- Debts are a matter of honor.
- No, this...

39:53.142 --> 39:55.436
So, come again. What do you need?

39:56.103 --> 39:58.814
I'm investigating the Auschwitz camp.

40:00.107 --> 40:02.485
You're out of your mind.

40:02.651 --> 40:05.654
Nobody wants that. Not you, not us either.

40:05.946 --> 40:07.239
Just let things be.

40:07.323 --> 40:09.075
Man, Hitler is gone.

40:09.658 --> 40:12.828
The Russians, they are the new enemy.

40:13.829 --> 40:17.333
I'll need the files of the SS men
who served at Auschwitz.

40:18.626 --> 40:19.835
All of them.

40:28.344 --> 40:31.305
10 million Nazis. Incredible, isn't it?

40:31.514 --> 40:34.183
And those idiots wrote everything down.

40:35.309 --> 40:38.187
If you believe you'll get
one of them in front of a court,

40:38.354 --> 40:40.439
you might as well believe in Santa Claus.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.858
I'm only interested in the Auschwitz ones.

40:43.025 --> 40:44.944
Did you bring a truck?

40:46.028 --> 40:48.114
There you go, 600,000 SS files.

40:48.197 --> 40:50.825
About 8,000 of them served at Auschwitz.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.370
But you'll have to dig those out yourself.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.031
Thank you.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.259
It was a machine.

41:50.426 --> 41:51.844
What was?

41:52.011 --> 41:53.220
Auschwitz.

41:53.387 --> 41:56.599
It was a murder machine
made up of 8,000 parts,

41:56.765 --> 42:00.394
small ones, big ones,
bureaucratic ones, sadistic ones...

42:01.687 --> 42:05.941
Eight weeks ago, we had a list of 15,
now I've got 8,000 SS men serving there.

42:06.108 --> 42:09.028
That makes 8,000 suspects, Gnielka.

42:10.279 --> 42:13.032
My previous case
was driving without a license.

42:14.450 --> 42:17.953
Look at it this way,
more enemies, more honor.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.122
What are we drinking to?

42:22.666 --> 42:23.709
<i>Veritas.</i>

42:25.794 --> 42:27.796
That was my father's motto.

42:29.632 --> 42:31.133
To the truth.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.975
8,000 Schulzes and Brandners.

42:40.434 --> 42:43.270
And I need witnesses for every one of them.

42:52.321 --> 42:54.323
- Let us in.
- What do you want?

42:56.450 --> 42:57.493
You must testify.

42:57.701 --> 43:00.537
- To what?
- You are a witness, Mr. Kirsch.

43:00.704 --> 43:02.831
I need your statement.

43:03.999 --> 43:07.002
- I won't talk about it.
- Simon, please.

43:07.169 --> 43:10.297
You must testify. You owe it to the victims.

43:11.674 --> 43:13.175
What do I owe them?

43:13.342 --> 43:15.010
What do you want from me?

43:15.344 --> 43:17.221
Haven't you had enough?

43:17.680 --> 43:18.973
What do you want?

43:19.139 --> 43:21.183
You want to investigate Auschwitz?

43:21.350 --> 43:23.727
You think that will change anything?

43:24.520 --> 43:26.689
You have no idea.

43:27.606 --> 43:28.899
No idea.

43:55.217 --> 43:56.593
Why?

43:58.554 --> 44:00.264
My girls.

44:02.516 --> 44:04.560
Ruth and Klara.

44:05.602 --> 44:07.104
So young.

44:13.402 --> 44:18.240
We arrived in the middle of the night,
hundreds of us, thousands.

44:18.407 --> 44:20.701
We were cold and hungry. it was freezing.

44:20.868 --> 44:24.079
We were surrounded
by the SS with their dogs.

44:25.581 --> 44:29.418
Everyone out, quick, quick, lining up.

44:29.585 --> 44:33.505
My wife Hannah
was put on a truck straightaway.

44:33.589 --> 44:36.800
Suddenly, there was this doctor.

44:39.094 --> 44:41.096
He was wearing white gloves.

44:42.514 --> 44:44.516
He looked like an angel.

44:46.268 --> 44:48.312
He was very calm.

44:49.438 --> 44:55.110
And then he knelt down
to look at Ruth and Klara.

44:59.114 --> 45:03.744
He stroked Ruth's hair and smiled,
and then he said to me,

45:03.911 --> 45:05.829
"Your twins are cute.

45:06.038 --> 45:08.374
"I'll bring them to my ward."

45:08.832 --> 45:11.126
And I thought, "He's a doctor.

45:15.464 --> 45:17.633
"They'll be safe with him."

45:21.595 --> 45:25.599
Then the others told me
what Mengele did to twins.

45:31.814 --> 45:35.651
That he tortures them with his experiments.

45:36.318 --> 45:40.364
That he injects them with viruses,
typhoid, TB, diphtheria.

45:40.531 --> 45:44.493
He cut them open without anesthetic.

45:44.660 --> 45:47.037
He removed organs from their bodies.

45:47.204 --> 45:49.289
He stuck needles into their heads.

45:49.456 --> 45:51.834
He sewed twins together, little children,

45:52.000 --> 45:55.379
back to back, like Siamese twins.

45:57.506 --> 45:59.591
And I gave them to him.

46:12.020 --> 46:14.523
Why are they dead and I'm alive?

46:36.879 --> 46:39.256
We'll put this doctor on trial.

46:40.424 --> 46:41.884
I promise.

47:55.123 --> 47:57.584
There was a camp physician...

47:57.751 --> 47:59.962
Dr. Josef Mengele.

48:00.629 --> 48:02.256
So you know the stories?

48:04.967 --> 48:07.219
He's the one we must get, Dr. Josef Mengele,

48:07.302 --> 48:09.805
he's the one, he is Auschwitz.

48:11.431 --> 48:13.642
All those who participated,

48:13.725 --> 48:16.019
who didn't say no,

48:16.645 --> 48:18.522
they are Auschwitz.

48:25.279 --> 48:27.197
How are you getting on?

48:29.866 --> 48:33.870
Calmly and matter-of-factly,
just say what you clearly remember.

48:36.123 --> 48:37.249
Mrs. Mandelbaum.

48:42.004 --> 48:43.338
Please.

50:36.118 --> 50:37.953
All right, we will appeal.

50:38.120 --> 50:40.330
- You can do that, Haller.
- With pleasure.

50:40.497 --> 50:44.000
Chief Prosecutor, I request
support for my investigations.

50:44.751 --> 50:46.503
Have Mr. Haller join him.

50:46.670 --> 50:48.505
Attorney General, please.

50:48.672 --> 50:53.593
I can't do without Mr. Haller,
we're already stretched thin.

50:53.760 --> 50:56.471
This matter is of the highest priority.

50:56.638 --> 50:57.764
Please,

50:57.931 --> 51:00.600
even Chancellor Adenauer made it clear

51:00.684 --> 51:04.521
that we must draw a line
under this unfortunate chapter.

51:04.813 --> 51:06.314
A trial would be poison.

51:06.481 --> 51:07.983
On the contrary.

51:08.150 --> 51:10.026
Hushing this up is poison.

51:10.193 --> 51:12.863
Poison for our young democracy.

51:13.029 --> 51:17.325
And besides, I'm the one who decides
when to draw the line.

51:24.624 --> 51:25.834
This is my good suit.

51:26.001 --> 51:28.837
Right, you brief me,
then I'll develop a strategy,

51:29.004 --> 51:30.672
and you can then report to me.

51:30.839 --> 51:32.674
Don't worry, I won't bite.

51:32.841 --> 51:36.052
I'm in charge of the investigation,
on the General's orders.

51:36.219 --> 51:38.638
Well, well, look who's all grown up.

51:41.850 --> 51:43.018
Who are the suspects?

51:43.185 --> 51:44.686
- Everyone.
- What do you mean?

51:44.853 --> 51:47.689
- Everyone who served there.
- That's ridiculous.

51:59.534 --> 52:01.286
A small boy,

52:01.369 --> 52:05.123
about five years old, jumped off the truck.

52:05.415 --> 52:07.542
He was holding an apple.

52:07.626 --> 52:09.753
Boger was standing at the door.

52:10.045 --> 52:14.382
The boy stood next to the truck
and was so happy about the apple.

52:14.466 --> 52:17.427
Boger went up to the boy,
grabbed him by the feet

52:17.594 --> 52:20.430
and smashed his head against the wall.

52:20.514 --> 52:24.810
Boger then picked up the apple
and told me to clean up the wall.

52:25.101 --> 52:27.395
And then Boger ate the apple.

52:28.355 --> 52:31.024
Everyday life at Auschwitz.

52:31.191 --> 52:32.943
You find that ridiculous?

52:39.616 --> 52:41.701
How many of the addresses did you get?

52:41.785 --> 52:43.912
The authorities are stalling.

52:45.705 --> 52:48.124
- Get every phone book.
- Pardon me?

52:48.291 --> 52:51.795
I've had it!
Get every phone book in Germany.

52:51.962 --> 52:54.381
We'll look up the addresses ourselves.

53:50.937 --> 53:53.356
Mengele was the worst of all.

53:53.523 --> 53:55.317
And you know why?

53:55.859 --> 53:57.027
He's like you and me.

53:57.193 --> 53:59.821
He had opportunities, became a doctor,

53:59.988 --> 54:02.991
took the Hippocratic oath,
loves opera, he's cultured.

54:03.158 --> 54:07.329
He's like us.
He was your age when he came to Auschwitz.

54:09.039 --> 54:11.041
I look at his photograph...

54:11.207 --> 54:14.002
Have you seen his photograph? He looks...

54:16.171 --> 54:18.173
He looks like a nice guy.

54:21.676 --> 54:25.805
If we let someone like him run free,
we are doomed, do you understand?

54:25.972 --> 54:28.391
Come on, Gnielka,
I want to dance with my hubby.

54:28.558 --> 54:30.352
- Come on, Johann.
- Just a second.

54:30.977 --> 54:32.687
Our hero is tired.

54:39.027 --> 54:41.905
You will nail this guy. Don't worry about it.

54:43.365 --> 54:45.742
Ladies, here I am.

55:01.257 --> 55:04.177
<i>Marching in spirit</i>

55:04.344 --> 55:07.263
<i>Within our ranks</i>

55:08.556 --> 55:12.602
<i>Our comrades shot by the Red Front</i>

55:12.769 --> 55:14.938
What's going on there?

55:15.105 --> 55:17.065
It's my dad's war comrades.

55:17.232 --> 55:19.943
They meet once a month to get drunk.
It's awful.

55:20.110 --> 55:24.072
Pioneer Battalion 221,
"Every shot downs a Russian."

55:27.242 --> 55:29.285
I can't handle this today.

55:32.747 --> 55:35.041
Let's go down to the river.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.715
No, take me to your place.

55:48.596 --> 55:50.765
My landlady has ears like a bat.

56:16.291 --> 56:18.376
Come on, I'll take you home.

57:28.905 --> 57:30.573
My darling.

57:55.223 --> 57:57.225
Life is beautiful.

58:43.438 --> 58:47.775
Can you tell me which country and city
has the area code 005411?

58:49.068 --> 58:50.486
Thanks, I'll wait.

58:51.112 --> 58:52.530
I know where Mengele is.

58:52.655 --> 58:53.907
What? Where?

58:54.073 --> 58:57.118
The long-distance calls
of the Mengele family in Günzburg.

58:57.577 --> 58:58.620
Thank you.

58:59.454 --> 59:01.164
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

59:01.331 --> 59:02.624
I'll go to the BKA.

59:02.790 --> 59:06.794
We have enough evidence against
this baker, Brandner. Issue a warrant.

59:06.961 --> 59:08.421
Yes, I will.

59:08.588 --> 59:10.673
Mengele is in Buenos Aires.

59:11.466 --> 59:14.636
This is his telephone number,
that should be sufficient.

59:14.802 --> 59:17.472
Here's the warrant for his arrest.

59:17.639 --> 59:19.849
Please have him brought to Germany.

59:20.683 --> 59:22.685
Interesting theory.

59:25.313 --> 59:28.024
Unfortunately,
the Federal Police has limited means.

59:28.107 --> 59:30.944
And South America of all places.
It's so far away.

59:31.402 --> 59:34.197
But I'll be happy to pass it on.

59:38.701 --> 59:40.453
I'll take you to the station.

59:41.412 --> 59:43.623
- Don't worry.
- I insist. I'll drive you.

59:53.841 --> 59:55.551
Now we can talk.

59:57.971 --> 01:00:00.515
We knew that Mengele is in Buenos Aires.

01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:03.268
We have a thick file on him, but...

01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:04.602
But what?

01:00:05.853 --> 01:00:08.731
Those who fled after '45 are off-limits.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:11.401
An order from up high.

01:00:12.568 --> 01:00:14.570
Is there any way you can help me?

01:00:15.822 --> 01:00:18.574
We know he travels to Günzburg
to see his family.

01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:20.368
He comes back to Germany?

01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:23.830
Regularly. He knows there is hardly any risk.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:28.918
Thank you.

01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:38.261
I don't have time to take you to the station.
I just wanted to talk.

01:00:38.428 --> 01:00:40.054
I see. Of course.

01:00:43.558 --> 01:00:44.559
Thanks anyway.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:54.902
You've been to see the Federal Police.

01:00:55.695 --> 01:00:58.531
- How do you know?
- Have a seat.

01:01:04.245 --> 01:01:06.956
You're still not grasping the extent of this.

01:01:07.123 --> 01:01:11.085
Mengele, Eichmann and the rest
are protected by powerful friends.

01:01:11.252 --> 01:01:12.754
You can trust no one.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.297
No one at all.

01:01:14.464 --> 01:01:18.259
- But I know Mengele's whereabouts.
- I know, but you must let it rest.

01:01:18.426 --> 01:01:22.221
You obtained a warrant for his arrest,
just leave it at that.

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:26.100
Attorney General...

01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:29.103
Concentrate on the other suspects

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:31.939
and leave Mengele to me. Understood?

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:37.779
You did say all of them.

01:01:38.946 --> 01:01:41.783
And we're to comb through
all of them for our suspects?

01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:42.867
Yes.

01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:44.952
I'm not carrying them.

01:01:46.162 --> 01:01:49.457
Your ideas always mean work for me.

01:02:07.141 --> 01:02:09.310
Mengele's father died.

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:13.272
- Are your men at Günzburg?
- I told you what our position is.

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:15.983
That's all I can do.

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:41.134
Do you think he's inside?

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:44.470
If Mengele ever comes to Germany, it's now.

01:02:47.682 --> 01:02:49.684
That stays there.

01:02:55.565 --> 01:02:57.567
PRIVATE FUNCTION TODAY

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:09.829
Can't you read? This is a private function.

01:03:09.996 --> 01:03:12.874
Johann Radmann,
Public Prosecutor's Office, Frankfurt.

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:15.668
We are looking for Josef Mengele.

01:03:45.239 --> 01:03:47.074
You scared me.

01:03:47.617 --> 01:03:48.910
Thank you.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:54.749
Will you do something for me, too?

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.589
Do you know where Mengele is?

01:04:02.215 --> 01:04:05.134
Everyone in Günzburg
works at the Mengeles'' factory.

01:04:05.301 --> 01:04:06.928
They won't say anything.

01:04:09.764 --> 01:04:12.934
But my dad saw him at the cemetery today.

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.602
He recognized him.

01:04:14.769 --> 01:04:17.146
But then he drove off.

01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:20.149
I've got to go back in.

01:04:20.942 --> 01:04:22.944
You hear a lot around here.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:26.072
I urge you to call me if he turns up again.

01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:30.535
- He did this to children.
- I don't want to see it.

01:04:30.618 --> 01:04:34.956
Take a good look.
This is what Josef Mengele did to children.

01:04:41.921 --> 01:04:44.006
I am certain he was at Günzburg today.

01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:49.095
The Border Guard must check all passengers
to South America, flights and ships.

01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:52.682
No, not "Naegele", "Mengele."

01:04:52.848 --> 01:04:55.726
Mike, Echo, November,
Golf, Echo, Lima, Echo.

01:04:58.145 --> 01:05:03.276
Look again, he must be on the list.
There's a warrant out for him.

01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:07.822
There's no time for a written request,
he'll be gone by then!

01:05:12.827 --> 01:05:14.662
I can't believe it!

01:05:27.216 --> 01:05:29.093
- Where have you been?
- Why?

01:05:29.176 --> 01:05:31.387
The baker, Brandner. He's disappeared.

01:05:31.846 --> 01:05:33.598
- What?
- He's disappeared, gone.

01:05:33.681 --> 01:05:36.767
Because you didn't issue
the warrant you promised.

01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:39.520
- You had to go play Zorro.
- You know that...

01:05:39.729 --> 01:05:40.896
I don't care!

01:05:41.772 --> 01:05:45.610
We're public prosecutors.
Start acting like one.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.029
And stop drinking in my office.

01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:54.744
The Attorney General
wants to see you immediately.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:56.454
Good bye.

01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:04.378
You've acted against my orders.

01:06:04.545 --> 01:06:07.590
Quiet. How could you let
this Brandner get away?

01:06:07.757 --> 01:06:10.718
You were busy
making a fool of yourself in Günzburg.

01:06:10.885 --> 01:06:12.595
What were you thinking?

01:06:12.762 --> 01:06:14.305
He was at his father's funeral.

01:06:14.472 --> 01:06:17.933
Why does he dare
come back to Germany? Why?

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.977
Because he knows we'll let him go.

01:06:20.144 --> 01:06:24.106
You've been working on this case
for four months, Mr. Radmann.

01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:26.484
What have you got to show for it? Nothing.

01:06:26.651 --> 01:06:28.819
We're running out of time.

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:32.114
For now, the Justice Minister
still supports me.

01:06:32.281 --> 01:06:35.076
But the state elections could change that.

01:06:35.618 --> 01:06:37.244
Then I'll be gone.

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:39.664
There won't be a trial anymore.

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:41.999
Without Mengele, the trial is pointless.

01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:44.919
Do you want to try a mere phantom?

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:51.634
Your obsession with Mengele
jeopardizes the entire investigation.

01:06:51.801 --> 01:06:53.803
What about all the others?

01:06:53.969 --> 01:06:57.181
This Mulka, or Camp Commander Baer?

01:06:57.348 --> 01:07:01.268
These men are responsible
for hundreds of thousands of deaths.

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:03.729
Aren't they dramatic enough for you?

01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:07.775
Here.

01:07:11.654 --> 01:07:14.824
"If you carry on like this,
you'll be gassed, too."

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:19.203
"A traitor is the worst scum
in all the country."

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:25.626
"Death or life, Jew?" and so on and so forth.

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:27.878
That's why we're doing this.

01:07:27.962 --> 01:07:31.465
The Germans must see
the crimes that were committed,

01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:35.970
not just by Hitler and Himmler,
but by completely ordinary people

01:07:36.137 --> 01:07:38.514
who did it voluntarily, out of conviction.

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:41.183
They are the ones we're trying.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.018
One big trial.

01:07:43.185 --> 01:07:45.312
This is the way to do it.

01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:47.481
And this is your task.

01:08:02.204 --> 01:08:04.081
Mr. Mulka. Radmann, prosecutor.

01:08:04.248 --> 01:08:07.877
You couldn't answer our summons,
good to see you're well again.

01:08:08.043 --> 01:08:09.044
What do you want?

01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:12.256
You were Adjutant Camp Commander
at Auschwitz.

01:08:12.423 --> 01:08:15.009
- So?
- I'm investigating you.

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:17.428
Listen, I was a soldier.

01:08:17.595 --> 01:08:19.846
I never set foot in that camp.

01:08:20.014 --> 01:08:21.849
I don't know what happened there.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:25.685
Who are you trying to fool?
You were the commander's right-hand man.

01:08:25.853 --> 01:08:27.270
I'll bring you to justice.

01:08:27.438 --> 01:08:28.939
If you approach me again,

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:32.859
I'll cause you so much trouble
you won't know what hit you.

01:08:34.737 --> 01:08:37.072
- Let's call it a night.
- I'm carrying on.

01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:40.533
You know what, Radmann?

01:08:40.868 --> 01:08:42.870
You definitely are crazy.

01:08:43.746 --> 01:08:46.957
But you definitely aren't a little green man.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:50.752
Here, more photos of the ramp.

01:09:01.764 --> 01:09:03.765
Left, right,

01:09:03.933 --> 01:09:05.225
left, right,

01:09:06.227 --> 01:09:07.394
left...

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.729
Don't you know where left is, Anton?

01:09:09.897 --> 01:09:11.941
Right, left...

01:09:13.484 --> 01:09:15.653
Which of you rascals has misbehaved?

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:20.573
Alois Schulz, I'm arresting you for aiding
and abetting murder in hundreds of cases.

01:09:25.246 --> 01:09:27.247
I only did office work.

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:31.585
Here...

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:33.921
That's you.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.432
Yes.

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:48.810
Several witnesses testified
you made selections at the ramp.

01:09:48.978 --> 01:09:51.772
- You selected victims for the gas chambers.
- Yes, but...

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:54.024
Mr. Schulz, please.

01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:57.278
It's like this.

01:09:57.361 --> 01:10:00.114
You'll have to prove
that Mr. Schulz selected anyone.

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:03.117
The picture is out of focus.

01:10:03.784 --> 01:10:05.953
It seems this camp was a horrible place.

01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:10.082
I'm sure whoever arrived there,
after a grueling journey,

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.917
was in a state of shock.

01:10:12.167 --> 01:10:17.506
I doubt very much that the testimonies
of those pitiable people are still valid

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.466
after almost 20 years.

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:24.805
And assuming Mr. Schulz
did indeed select anyone,

01:10:25.097 --> 01:10:29.143
then the purpose was to prevent those
who were fit for work from being gassed.

01:10:29.518 --> 01:10:31.645
So he was in fact saving people's lives.

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:34.356
You shut your mouth now!

01:10:40.404 --> 01:10:43.657
I disagree with your legal interpretation.

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:47.536
Mr. Schulz has stated
that he only followed orders,

01:10:47.786 --> 01:10:48.913
which was his duty.

01:10:48.996 --> 01:10:52.666
Mr. Lichter, your client is a murder suspect
and stays in custody.

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:03.552
You should be gassed, you bastard.

01:11:06.847 --> 01:11:07.932
Gentlemen.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:16.273
None of us were thinking.

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:20.069
All we had to do was open our eyes.

01:11:25.616 --> 01:11:26.992
Shit.

01:11:44.385 --> 01:11:46.136
I've got one.

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:07.241
- Hello.
- Oh, dear.

01:12:07.992 --> 01:12:09.743
Wow.

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:11.078
- I forgot.
- And?

01:12:11.245 --> 01:12:14.748
- And what?
- This, you boor. I made it myself.

01:12:14.915 --> 01:12:16.667
- Yes, very nice.
- Respect.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:20.379
- Marlene, we're just...
- Come, we can't let the posh people wait.

01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:21.672
Off you go.

01:12:23.757 --> 01:12:24.842
Come on!

01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:27.261
The Americans had just let me go.

01:12:27.386 --> 01:12:31.181
I was 35 and had never worked as a lawyer.

01:12:31.473 --> 01:12:33.851
And then my first client walked in,

01:12:34.018 --> 01:12:37.521
looking for a lawyer
to register a patent for him.

01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:39.440
Free of charge, naturally.

01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:42.943
We've grown dramatically since then.

01:12:43.652 --> 01:12:46.447
- Why did they invite us?
- I don't know.

01:12:50.034 --> 01:12:52.161
But I have a suspicion.

01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:03.964
Boy, do they have potential.

01:13:04.131 --> 01:13:06.800
- I'm starving, Walter.
- Me, too.

01:13:07.134 --> 01:13:08.385
Shall we?

01:13:10.012 --> 01:13:12.556
I don't like to see
a good lawyer's talent wasted.

01:13:12.723 --> 01:13:14.391
Let me introduce you to Dr. Mertens.

01:13:16.727 --> 01:13:19.146
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

01:13:19.563 --> 01:13:23.358
Tell me, where in Frankfurt
can one find a dress like this?

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:24.526
Oh, this...

01:13:24.735 --> 01:13:26.320
At her shop, of course.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:29.406
You have your own fashion studio?

01:13:31.325 --> 01:13:33.535
I'm just starting out.

01:13:57.017 --> 01:13:59.561
Your fiancée? My compliments.

01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:01.438
But you're impressive, too.

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:05.526
Honors degree,
assistant to Professor Rimmelsbacher.

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:07.444
- That's correct, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:11.865
You're exactly the kind of person I need,
young, enthusiastic.

01:14:12.032 --> 01:14:14.618
All that's required
is to channel that energy properly.

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:17.079
- Thanks...
- I know.

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:22.376
You don't have to decide now,
just bear it in mind.

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:25.045
You know where to find me now.

01:14:30.134 --> 01:14:32.469
Four ladies ordered dresses from me.

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:35.764
It's been a lovely evening, Johann.

01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:49.903
This is Prosecutor Radmann.

01:14:50.779 --> 01:14:53.490
Mr. Radmann, this is Mr. Kleiner,

01:14:53.657 --> 01:14:56.410
German correspondent
or the <i>Jerusalem Post.</i>

01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:58.453
These two gentlemen are from Israel.

01:14:58.537 --> 01:14:59.830
Pleased to meet you.

01:14:59.913 --> 01:15:04.084
I asked Mr. Radmann to come because
he knows most about Josef Mengele,

01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:06.461
including his current location.

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:11.216
We're cooperating to apprehend
Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele

01:15:11.425 --> 01:15:14.344
in Argentina and bring them here.

01:15:14.511 --> 01:15:17.764
Please share your information
with these gentlemen.

01:15:24.104 --> 01:15:26.106
And you'll bring us Mengele?

01:15:27.024 --> 01:15:29.484
If anyone does it, it'll be us.

01:15:39.494 --> 01:15:42.206
Kleiner isn't just a journalist, is he?

01:15:42.289 --> 01:15:43.290
No.

01:15:48.003 --> 01:15:49.713
Can they be trusted?

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.049
Who can you trust?

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:56.762
I still live in exile,
only not in Sweden anymore.

01:15:56.845 --> 01:15:59.264
The moment I leave my office,

01:15:59.473 --> 01:16:01.934
I'm in enemy territory.

01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:12.486
I trust you.

01:16:28.377 --> 01:16:29.711
Watch out.

01:16:30.712 --> 01:16:32.172
It's not dry yet.

01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:36.677
It's beautiful, Simon. Thank you.

01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:38.011
Johann!

01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:45.852
Now then...

01:16:47.938 --> 01:16:49.940
This is the big moment.

01:16:54.194 --> 01:16:57.030
- As good as new.
- I've always wanted one like this.

01:16:57.197 --> 01:16:58.282
To Marlene.

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:00.701
Cheers.

01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:05.080
"Dear housewife, your dream has come true.

01:17:05.247 --> 01:17:07.541
"The new Pfaff Automatic 230,

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:11.628
"the sewing machine with endless
possibilities, is yours."

01:17:12.713 --> 01:17:14.339
Great, isn't it?

01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:17.759
We're nearly there.
We'll put Mengele on trial in Frankfurt.

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.809
"Make all your friends jealous

01:17:25.976 --> 01:17:28.770
"and bring a smile to your husband's face."

01:17:36.403 --> 01:17:40.115
This is unbelievable, falling asleep like this.

01:17:40.282 --> 01:17:44.453
Mr. Prosecutor can't get excited about
a sewing machine, even such a grand one.

01:17:44.619 --> 01:17:47.331
I was just closing my eyes briefly because...

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:52.794
Because I was blinded
by the beauty of your sewing machine.

01:17:52.878 --> 01:17:55.130
Careful, your nose is getting longer.

01:17:55.922 --> 01:17:59.176
A good businessman
keeps track of all transactions.

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.305
Of course.

01:18:04.598 --> 01:18:06.266
You are wonderful.

01:18:11.438 --> 01:18:12.981
Thank you, Joseph.

01:18:13.148 --> 01:18:14.316
Mr. Mulka.

01:18:15.359 --> 01:18:17.277
This is a warrant for your arrest.

01:18:17.444 --> 01:18:18.945
What's all this?

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:21.156
An accessory facilitates the offense.

01:18:21.323 --> 01:18:24.451
Here's an order for Zyklon B,
signed by Robert Mulka,

01:18:24.618 --> 01:18:26.787
Hauptsturmführer and adjutant.

01:18:27.662 --> 01:18:29.873
That was long ago, I don't remember it.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.459
You don't have to. This is enough.

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:37.130
I'm arresting you for aiding
and abetting murder in thousands of cases.

01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:41.510
Come with us, please.

01:18:46.973 --> 01:18:49.309
Have a drink with us, Chief Prosecutor.

01:18:49.476 --> 01:18:52.729
You're getting younger every day,
how do you do it?

01:18:52.813 --> 01:18:54.106
Cheers!

01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:58.902
- That looks delicious.
-It's home-baked.

01:18:59.486 --> 01:19:02.739
Of course, the bakers
are all fleeing from Mr. Radmann.

01:19:04.491 --> 01:19:06.827
Where's your sheriff's badge?

01:19:06.993 --> 01:19:09.329
- What?
- Considering your cowboy methods,

01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:12.499
you should wear
a cowboy hat and a sheriff's badge.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.836
This is outrageous.

01:19:17.045 --> 01:19:18.505
I beg your pardon?

01:19:18.672 --> 01:19:20.674
Why do you ridicule our work?

01:19:20.841 --> 01:19:23.427
Because this show trial
is harmful, disgusting,

01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.387
and has nothing to do with the law.

01:19:27.222 --> 01:19:29.516
Of course, you would think that.

01:19:32.561 --> 01:19:34.563
Come on, say it.

01:19:34.729 --> 01:19:36.523
You think I was a Nazi, too.

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:38.859
You're convinced of it, aren't you?

01:19:38.942 --> 01:19:41.069
For Mr. Radmann, everyone was a Nazi.

01:19:41.153 --> 01:19:43.363
Why don't you ask what I did in the war?

01:19:43.572 --> 01:19:45.949
I'll tell you if you're interested.

01:19:46.116 --> 01:19:48.743
Law studies at Heidelberg, then the Navy,

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:51.621
lieutenant commander, 7th submarine fleet.

01:19:51.788 --> 01:19:54.708
After the war,
one year as a French prisoner of war.

01:19:54.916 --> 01:19:59.045
Released in August 1946, sewed with honor.

01:19:59.129 --> 01:20:02.757
And by the way,
I was never a member of the Party.

01:20:05.135 --> 01:20:07.053
Do you still want to arrest me?

01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:10.891
These men must pay for their crimes.
It's a question of justice.

01:20:11.057 --> 01:20:13.560
Of course, justice is your exclusive domain.

01:20:13.727 --> 01:20:15.729
Parading around some small fish,

01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:18.565
while millions of others
are allowed to carry on.

01:20:18.732 --> 01:20:19.941
How is this justice?

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:21.985
Your "small fish" are criminals.

01:20:22.152 --> 01:20:24.070
Are you aware of the consequences?

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:28.158
Do you want every young German to ask
if their father was a murderer?

01:20:28.325 --> 01:20:30.243
Yes, that's exactly what I want.

01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:34.956
I want these lies and this silence to end.

01:21:16.456 --> 01:21:20.043
You are Richard Baer,
the last camp commander at Auschwitz.

01:21:21.378 --> 01:21:22.796
You're under arrest.

01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:25.549
You're under arrest.

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:29.010
You pushed the prisoner's head down
until he drowned.

01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:34.849
You forced the group to spend the night
outside the barracks in winter.

01:21:35.016 --> 01:21:36.810
Two of them froze to death.

01:21:41.481 --> 01:21:42.816
Dr. Berger, come with us.

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:45.902
You were involved
in the transport of prisoners.

01:21:53.577 --> 01:21:56.037
You kept kicking him with your boots

01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:58.331
until he lay dead on the ground.

01:21:59.499 --> 01:22:02.043
You shot the child being held by its mother.

01:22:02.210 --> 01:22:03.420
Both died.

01:22:03.587 --> 01:22:04.838
Mr. Rinke.

01:22:06.047 --> 01:22:07.507
You're under arrest.

01:22:07.674 --> 01:22:10.343
You fed the Zyklon B into the apparatus.

01:22:13.221 --> 01:22:17.392
You used the dogs to chase the prisoner
into the electric fence.

01:22:22.188 --> 01:22:25.108
That wasn't an order,
it was your own initiative.

01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:29.279
Start telling the truth.

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:45.211
The arrests of Richard Baer,
the last Auschwitz camp commander,

01:22:45.378 --> 01:22:49.883
and of Robert Mulka are the culmination
of our efforts at redressing these crimes.

01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:51.718
Chief Prosecutor, I have a question.

01:22:51.885 --> 01:22:53.970
- What will the charges be?
- Murder.

01:22:54.054 --> 01:22:56.556
Kirsch had a heart attack,
he's in the hospital.

01:22:56.765 --> 01:22:58.266
It was very close.

01:23:08.234 --> 01:23:10.487
I never said the Kaddish.

01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:15.909
What do you mean?

01:23:16.076 --> 01:23:18.119
In the camp, God was...

01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:21.915
He wasn't there.

01:23:22.457 --> 01:23:26.961
When I lay on the floor, waiting for
the ambulance, all I could think of was

01:23:28.254 --> 01:23:33.259
that I never said the Kaddish
for Ruth and Klara, my girls.

01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:39.265
I won't make it anymore, I can't go there.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.857
Please, you do it for me.

01:23:48.525 --> 01:23:50.610
Go to Auschwitz and do this for me.

01:23:50.777 --> 01:23:52.320
Say the Kaddish for them.

01:23:52.487 --> 01:23:55.115
You'll do that yourself
when you're well again.

01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:58.284
Today I cheated death for the second time.

01:23:59.285 --> 01:24:00.954
You do it for me.

01:24:01.621 --> 01:24:04.165
No, I must conduct this trial first.

01:24:06.501 --> 01:24:07.669
Please.

01:24:07.794 --> 01:24:09.796
No, Simon, I don't have time for this.

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:11.840
I must conduct this trial.

01:24:34.904 --> 01:24:36.072
Johann!

01:24:36.239 --> 01:24:37.490
Johann!

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:39.325
Johann!

01:24:40.326 --> 01:24:43.830
- Look, they've abducted Eichmann to Israel.
- What? Incredible.

01:24:44.497 --> 01:24:46.541
That is incredible!

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:49.669
Attorney General.

01:24:52.338 --> 01:24:54.007
This is great news.

01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:57.677
I would have preferred to have him here.

01:24:57.844 --> 01:25:01.347
But Bonn refused to file
an extradition request with Israel.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:05.018
So when will they bring us Mengele,
have they arrested him yet?

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:07.479
He must come straight to Frankfurt.

01:25:07.562 --> 01:25:09.606
Mengele has left Argentina.

01:25:11.608 --> 01:25:12.859
What? Where is he?

01:25:13.026 --> 01:25:15.361
There are rumors he's in Paraguay.

01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:17.363
Then the Mossad must get him there.

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:21.367
Please, Mr. Radmann, this isn't
a mail-order catalog to just choose from.

01:25:26.539 --> 01:25:28.875
It's a lot more complicated.

01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.813
You didn't want Eichmann, so we're doing it.

01:25:49.896 --> 01:25:52.732
Good. But you must bring
Mengele to Germany,

01:25:52.941 --> 01:25:54.400
then we'll try him here.

01:25:58.321 --> 01:26:00.657
Imagine two deer standing in a clearing.

01:26:00.824 --> 01:26:03.409
When you shoot one, the other one's gone.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:04.744
What do you mean?

01:26:04.911 --> 01:26:08.081
Mengele is gone.
He's not an issue for us at the moment.

01:26:12.919 --> 01:26:14.087
But you promised...

01:26:14.295 --> 01:26:17.507
Eichmann was always a priority for us.

01:26:17.674 --> 01:26:19.259
For Bauer, too.

01:26:19.926 --> 01:26:21.135
What?

01:26:21.511 --> 01:26:24.514
Eichmann organized the "Final Solution."
Mengele...

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:28.601
Bring Mengele to Germany, I implore you.

01:26:28.768 --> 01:26:31.938
The UN already gave us a hard time
because of Eichmann.

01:26:32.105 --> 01:26:37.026
We're a small country, a young country.
We can't afford to make any more enemies.

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:39.445
We're already surrounded by enemies.

01:26:43.741 --> 01:26:46.536
Mengele is cunning. He could be anywhere.

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.455
I have to get him in Europe.

01:26:50.498 --> 01:26:52.792
He must travel under a different name.

01:26:52.959 --> 01:26:56.212
Otherwise I would have found him
after Günzburg.

01:26:56.379 --> 01:26:58.548
I need that name, Mr. Fischer.

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:02.135
I was so close.

01:27:03.177 --> 01:27:05.221
It's not my car's fault.

01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:27.452
Hello.

01:27:29.996 --> 01:27:32.206
Kathi, isn't it? Please, have a seat.

01:27:32.373 --> 01:27:34.709
I don't have much time,
I have a train to catch.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:36.586
Mengele has been to visit.

01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:40.715
I heard his mother tell my boss.
He's flying back from Frankfurt today.

01:27:41.424 --> 01:27:44.552
I wanted to call the police, but my boss...

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:47.555
Thank you.

01:27:59.525 --> 01:28:01.069
I need to talk to Mr. Fischer.

01:28:01.736 --> 01:28:03.947
Where is he? It's urgent.

01:28:04.113 --> 01:28:06.199
Mr. Fischer has been suspended.

01:28:07.867 --> 01:28:10.787
Your generation has no sense of loyalty.

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:21.798
I need the name Mengele is traveling under.

01:28:21.965 --> 01:28:23.883
Please tell me.

01:28:41.442 --> 01:28:43.778
I warned you. It was leaking oil.

01:28:43.945 --> 01:28:46.072
- Can you fix it?
- The engine's seized.

01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:49.617
We don't even know what name he uses.
Why go to the airport?

01:28:49.701 --> 01:28:52.537
I'll know Mengele when I see him, believe me.

01:29:00.461 --> 01:29:02.255
Damn it.

01:29:15.893 --> 01:29:17.353
And?

01:29:22.859 --> 01:29:24.277
Mr. Radmann,

01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:26.612
who do you think you are?

01:29:26.779 --> 01:29:28.322
Mr. Wisnievska was very upset.

01:29:28.489 --> 01:29:33.119
I convinced him to testify about
his ordeal at Auschwitz and you stand us up.

01:29:34.704 --> 01:29:36.956
Mr. Langbein, I'm doing what I can.

01:29:50.845 --> 01:29:52.930
What are you doing in Frankfurt, Mother?

01:29:53.014 --> 01:29:55.141
If you don't call me...

01:29:55.349 --> 01:29:58.186
What's going on here,
are you moving offices?

01:29:59.896 --> 01:30:01.481
Son, I need to talk to you.

01:30:01.647 --> 01:30:02.607
I'm busy.

01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:05.401
Don't be stubborn, Johann, it's important.

01:30:06.319 --> 01:30:08.071
Please leave.

01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:13.159
Gustav asked me to marry him and I said yes.

01:30:13.409 --> 01:30:14.911
You're already married.

01:30:15.536 --> 01:30:17.580
No one comes back after 15 years.

01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:23.336
I've requested that he be declared dead.

01:30:27.882 --> 01:30:29.884
I want you at my wedding.

01:30:30.051 --> 01:30:31.719
But I don't. Gustav was a Nazi.

01:30:31.886 --> 01:30:33.721
How dare you?

01:30:33.888 --> 01:30:37.183
You don't even know him.
Gustav was in the Party. They all were.

01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:38.851
My father wasn't.

01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:40.353
Of course he was!

01:30:41.687 --> 01:30:42.688
What?

01:30:43.231 --> 01:30:46.901
Dad was a member of the Party.
He had no choice, just like Gustav.

01:30:48.277 --> 01:30:51.030
That's enough. You're lying. Get out.

01:30:52.031 --> 01:30:54.617
You sully Dad's honor to excuse this Gustav!
Get out!

01:30:54.784 --> 01:30:56.244
- Be reasonable.
- Get out!

01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:47.670
Dad?

01:32:16.741 --> 01:32:17.950
Don't do it.

01:32:19.118 --> 01:32:20.995
I must know.

01:32:21.996 --> 01:32:23.456
Don't do it.

01:32:24.457 --> 01:32:26.000
Kurt Radmann,

01:32:26.083 --> 01:32:28.711
born in Marburg in 1898.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:34.008
Can you find out
if he was a member of the Party?

01:32:45.978 --> 01:32:47.647
Wait in the lobby.

01:33:30.856 --> 01:33:32.441
Marlene.

01:33:32.733 --> 01:33:35.111
Johann, how nice. One second.

01:33:45.538 --> 01:33:46.998
You're drunk.

01:33:47.164 --> 01:33:49.083
How else can you cope?

01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:52.962
I have one drunkard at home,
I don't need another one.

01:33:54.422 --> 01:33:57.466
No, Miss Wondrak
runs with a better crowd now.

01:34:00.136 --> 01:34:02.763
You forgot something there.

01:34:03.931 --> 01:34:05.891
- Where's the swastika?
- What?

01:34:05.975 --> 01:34:08.519
The dress is for the wife
of some Nazi criminal.

01:34:08.769 --> 01:34:10.271
What? Are you crazy?

01:34:10.438 --> 01:34:14.233
Mertens, Lichter,
all these fine people are criminals.

01:34:14.358 --> 01:34:15.818
How do I know that?

01:34:15.943 --> 01:34:20.865
Because this is a nation of criminals
and they all act as if nothing happened.

01:34:21.115 --> 01:34:25.411
All these colors.
We Germans should wear black forever.

01:34:26.579 --> 01:34:27.913
Forever and ever.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:29.415
And you're making this.

01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:31.834
Careful!

01:34:32.001 --> 01:34:34.462
Are you crazy?
I need to deliver this tomorrow!

01:34:34.628 --> 01:34:38.007
You've become unbearable.
You only see the bad. You're blind.

01:34:38.174 --> 01:34:41.927
- Not everyone is bad!
- I'm blind? It's you who's blind.

01:34:43.679 --> 01:34:46.182
Pioneer Battalion 221.

01:34:47.516 --> 01:34:50.686
Your father was stationed in Poland,
I checked him out.

01:34:50.853 --> 01:34:52.521
Do you know what they did?

01:34:56.108 --> 01:34:58.652
Why don't you ask him why he drinks?

01:35:09.288 --> 01:35:11.290
I don't believe it.

01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:16.962
How dare you do this? Get out! Out!

01:35:18.297 --> 01:35:20.633
I never want to see you again! Out!

01:35:50.079 --> 01:35:51.330
Sheriff Radmann

01:35:51.497 --> 01:35:54.917
and his loyal companion, Chief Sharp Quill.

01:35:56.001 --> 01:36:00.005
They are outnumbered in their fight,
but in the end, the good prevails.

01:36:00.756 --> 01:36:03.759
In the end, the bad guys hang.

01:36:05.052 --> 01:36:07.430
Sheriff Radmann and Chief Sharp...

01:36:16.856 --> 01:36:19.567
- How did you know what it meant?
- What?

01:36:19.733 --> 01:36:22.778
What "shot while trying to escape" means.

01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:30.119
Tell me, how did you know?

01:36:30.578 --> 01:36:31.912
I was there.

01:36:33.873 --> 01:36:35.416
I'm sorry?

01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:40.087
At Auschwitz. I was there.

01:36:48.137 --> 01:36:50.973
You were at Auschwitz? During the war?

01:36:52.933 --> 01:36:54.477
- You're a liar.
- Stop it.

01:36:54.643 --> 01:36:56.729
- You are.
- You don't know what...

01:36:56.896 --> 01:37:00.232
I know way too much.
I know you're a liar and a hypocrite.

01:37:00.399 --> 01:37:01.817
That's the worst of all.

01:37:01.984 --> 01:37:05.070
Have you forgotten who I am, Johann?
Listen to me.

01:37:05.237 --> 01:37:06.989
You want to know what I did?

01:37:07.156 --> 01:37:08.657
I was 17.

01:37:08.824 --> 01:37:12.411
They recruited all the boys in my class
and then sent us to Auschwitz.

01:37:12.578 --> 01:37:15.247
Sure, you just followed orders,
the big excuse.

01:37:15.414 --> 01:37:18.083
And in the end it was all just Hitler's fault.

01:37:18.959 --> 01:37:22.588
You wanted to know, didn't you?
Now listen to me, damn it!

01:37:32.431 --> 01:37:34.600
We had to watch the inmates.

01:37:35.601 --> 01:37:38.020
There was a Polish professor,

01:37:38.187 --> 01:37:39.939
Tadeusz Rosenthal.

01:37:40.981 --> 01:37:45.611
I secretly slipped him bread and cigarettes,
but then they found it on him.

01:37:45.778 --> 01:37:49.615
To punish him, they stood him
next to the fence and threw his cap over.

01:37:49.782 --> 01:37:52.660
Then they ordered him to fetch it.

01:37:53.118 --> 01:37:55.120
And then they shot him in the back.

01:37:55.788 --> 01:37:59.667
"Shot while trying to escape."
Do you understand, Johann?

01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:03.045
Just like on those lists.

01:38:08.342 --> 01:38:09.802
You disgust me.

01:38:14.473 --> 01:38:16.475
You all disgust me.

01:38:46.922 --> 01:38:48.007
He's drunk.

01:38:48.173 --> 01:38:50.092
What did you do? Were you a Nazi?

01:38:50.259 --> 01:38:52.261
- Were you one of them?
- Idiot!

01:38:54.346 --> 01:38:55.347
You.

01:38:55.848 --> 01:38:58.017
Why didn't you do anything?
Why did you join in?

01:38:58.183 --> 01:38:59.184
Outrageous!

01:38:59.351 --> 01:39:00.769
You bum!

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.775
You were all in on it.

01:39:12.615 --> 01:39:14.366
You were a Nazi.

01:39:14.533 --> 01:39:15.784
You were one...

01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:48.734
Why me?

01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:54.114
- What do you mean?
- This trial. The investigations.

01:39:54.406 --> 01:39:55.783
Why me?

01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:58.827
Because you were born in 1930.

01:39:59.244 --> 01:40:01.580
- You're exonerated.
- No.

01:40:02.164 --> 01:40:04.958
Because I was naive enough
to burn myself out for you.

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:07.503
By the way, my father was a Nazi, too.

01:40:07.670 --> 01:40:09.505
What did you expect?

01:40:09.588 --> 01:40:12.299
Almost all the lawyers
were members of the Party.

01:40:14.259 --> 01:40:16.470
He was as guilty as the rest of them.

01:40:16.637 --> 01:40:21.767
If you think this is about
who's guilty, partly guilty or innocent,

01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:24.478
then you've learned nothing, nothing at all.

01:40:35.906 --> 01:40:37.491
I'm resigning.

01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:42.204
Radmann.

01:40:43.539 --> 01:40:45.541
You can't let us down.

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:56.468
I'm very pleased.

01:40:56.885 --> 01:40:58.971
I think you made the right decision.

01:40:59.847 --> 01:41:01.724
You'll start on Monday.

01:41:22.244 --> 01:41:24.246
I already know.

01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:27.791
Congratulations.

01:41:40.429 --> 01:41:43.515
I wanted to thank you
for all your help, Schmittchen.

01:41:45.684 --> 01:41:47.394
Save your breath.

01:41:55.110 --> 01:41:57.112
Your... Our client is in the wrong.

01:41:57.279 --> 01:41:59.406
He violated patent law. All we can...

01:41:59.573 --> 01:42:04.077
Son, we can't pay for all this
if our clients are in the wrong.

01:42:04.703 --> 01:42:05.913
Come in.

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:08.081
- Peter.
- Hans. Very good.

01:42:08.290 --> 01:42:09.625
Mr. Lichter, Mr. Radmann.

01:42:10.250 --> 01:42:13.879
I like to consult Mr. Lichter
if it gets a little dirty.

01:42:14.046 --> 01:42:17.424
I'm simply brilliant
and I do anything for our clients. May I?

01:42:17.508 --> 01:42:21.678
Gentlemen, work out a trial strategy.
Money is no object.

01:42:23.972 --> 01:42:26.558
I'm pleased we're working together now.

01:42:29.812 --> 01:42:31.063
Come on.

01:42:32.439 --> 01:42:34.817
Man is not born to be a hero.

01:42:34.983 --> 01:42:36.276
Right?

01:42:47.246 --> 01:42:48.497
Mr. Radmann?

01:43:25.033 --> 01:43:28.620
I was just as blind as everybody else.

01:43:29.496 --> 01:43:31.623
What are you going to do now?

01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:33.458
I don't know.

01:43:36.295 --> 01:43:39.006
But there's one thing I don't get, Simon.

01:43:39.172 --> 01:43:41.133
How can you still live here?

01:43:41.466 --> 01:43:43.844
How can you still live in Germany?

01:43:45.721 --> 01:43:46.889
Look.

01:43:48.849 --> 01:43:52.644
I came from Vienna when I was 18.

01:43:55.564 --> 01:43:57.649
I met my Hannah

01:43:59.651 --> 01:44:03.363
in the hat section
of Schneider's department store.

01:44:05.824 --> 01:44:08.660
My children were born
at the university hospital.

01:44:08.827 --> 01:44:11.997
I bought them their first ice cream
in the old town.

01:44:13.165 --> 01:44:16.668
We fed the ducks at the Grueneburgpark.

01:44:16.835 --> 01:44:19.421
One of them pecked Klara on the hand.

01:44:22.007 --> 01:44:23.508
Now tell me.

01:44:25.844 --> 01:44:28.096
Where else do I belong?

01:44:36.021 --> 01:44:38.899
I want to go to Auschwitz to say the Kaddish.

01:44:41.068 --> 01:44:43.570
I would very much like to do that.

01:44:46.073 --> 01:44:48.033
Will you give me the book?

01:44:58.377 --> 01:45:00.295
Gnielka must come with you.

01:45:00.545 --> 01:45:01.880
No, I'll go on my own.

01:45:02.047 --> 01:45:03.590
<i>Bubeleh.</i> ..

01:45:09.554 --> 01:45:11.098
All right.

01:46:47.569 --> 01:46:50.238
Why did you never talk about it?

01:46:51.323 --> 01:46:53.492
Because I'm ashamed.

01:46:54.534 --> 01:46:58.371
Because I just stood there
and watched, just watched.

01:46:58.830 --> 01:47:00.332
Kept my mouth shut and watched.

01:47:03.627 --> 01:47:05.629
What about the trial?

01:47:05.796 --> 01:47:07.589
How can you give all that up?

01:47:10.008 --> 01:47:13.095
I always wanted to fight for the good cause.

01:47:13.261 --> 01:47:15.347
But I don't know what that is anymore.

01:47:15.555 --> 01:47:17.349
How can I try another person?

01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:20.560
If I had been there...

01:47:27.359 --> 01:47:29.778
I don't know what I would have done.

01:47:29.945 --> 01:47:32.197
You're missing the point, Johann.

01:47:33.198 --> 01:47:35.534
Look around. What do you see?

01:47:38.954 --> 01:47:40.122
Auschwitz.

01:47:40.205 --> 01:47:42.666
No. You see a meadow.

01:47:42.874 --> 01:47:45.710
Trees, barracks, a fence.

01:47:46.211 --> 01:47:49.464
Auschwitz is the stories
that happened here and are buried here.

01:47:49.548 --> 01:47:53.176
Without the trial,
these stories will be forgotten.

01:47:53.468 --> 01:47:56.805
There is no appropriate punishment
for what happened here.

01:47:56.972 --> 01:47:58.723
It's not about punishment.

01:47:58.890 --> 01:48:01.768
It's about the victims, about their stories.

01:48:23.165 --> 01:48:24.958
What do we do now?

01:48:27.919 --> 01:48:29.963
Simon wrote it down.

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:55.048
Why have you come back?

01:49:57.509 --> 01:50:01.680
Because the only response to Auschwitz
is to do the right thing yourself.

01:50:17.988 --> 01:50:19.447
Good morning.

01:50:30.125 --> 01:50:31.751
You're back?

01:50:34.879 --> 01:50:35.964
I'm sorry.

01:50:36.131 --> 01:50:37.590
Forget it.

01:50:37.799 --> 01:50:39.384
Nobody's perfect.

01:50:39.592 --> 01:50:41.469
Apart from myself.

01:50:55.442 --> 01:51:00.030
Thank you. Goodbye.
I will get it on Monday, then.

01:51:00.989 --> 01:51:03.241
Hello. Can I help you?

01:51:03.408 --> 01:51:05.327
I have a repair job.

01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:07.746
I'll deal with this customer.

01:51:10.915 --> 01:51:12.167
How can I help?

01:51:16.463 --> 01:51:19.007
Can this be patched up?

01:51:21.343 --> 01:51:22.844
It's completely torn.

01:51:23.011 --> 01:51:24.512
I know.

01:51:26.097 --> 01:51:28.433
But it means the world to me.

01:51:34.272 --> 01:51:37.442
No, the tear is too big.

01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:40.362
It can't be saved.

01:51:41.863 --> 01:51:44.157
I will spare no expense, whatever it takes.

01:51:54.667 --> 01:51:57.128
Get yourself a new one.

01:51:57.212 --> 01:51:59.631
And then take better care of it.

01:52:05.345 --> 01:52:07.680
I guess I'll have to live with that.

01:52:08.973 --> 01:52:10.850
Yes, you'll have to.

01:52:48.221 --> 01:52:51.724
This is the life.
Good friends, cake and champagne.

01:52:51.891 --> 01:52:53.852
What more could you want?

01:52:57.522 --> 01:53:00.066
I didn't bring
my mom's cake back just for you.

01:53:00.233 --> 01:53:02.735
Let the boy eat, he's still growing.

01:53:11.369 --> 01:53:14.622
The trial date is set.
To the Prosecutor's Office, Frankfurt!

01:53:14.789 --> 01:53:16.541
And to you, Johann.

01:53:19.794 --> 01:53:21.296
<i>L'chaim.</i>

01:53:22.213 --> 01:53:23.256
To life!

01:53:23.423 --> 01:53:24.757
<i>L'chaim.</i>

01:53:24.924 --> 01:53:26.217
To life!

01:53:31.222 --> 01:53:32.557
That's all.

01:53:39.564 --> 01:53:40.815
Johann.

01:53:51.326 --> 01:53:53.244
I've brought your jacket.

01:53:53.995 --> 01:53:56.247
I thought the tear couldn't be fixed.

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:03.671
It's not completely fixed.

01:54:07.634 --> 01:54:09.594
The trial starts tomorrow.

01:54:09.761 --> 01:54:11.930
I know. Good luck.

01:54:42.126 --> 01:54:45.505
You'll give testimony on Friday.
Are you ready?

01:54:46.506 --> 01:54:48.007
Greenhorn,

01:54:49.467 --> 01:54:51.636
I've been ready for 20 years.

01:55:10.488 --> 01:55:11.823
I'll go in now.

01:55:19.247 --> 01:55:22.500
Gentlemen, today history is made.

01:55:29.215 --> 01:55:31.050
I'm proud of you.

01:56:03.458 --> 01:56:08.880
I declare the Jury Court
in Frankfurt now in session.

01:56:11.466 --> 01:56:14.344
The Auschwitz trial started in 1963.

01:56:14.427 --> 01:56:19.641
211 survivors of the concentration
and extermination camp gave testimony.

01:56:20.558 --> 01:56:23.686
19 SS men who had served at Auschwitz
were charged

01:56:23.770 --> 01:56:28.024
in the largest trial in the history
of the Federal Republic of Germany.

01:56:29.108 --> 01:56:31.611
17 of them were found guilty.

01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:37.283
Throughout the 20-month trial,
none of the defendants showed any remorse.

01:56:39.535 --> 01:56:43.956
Fritz Bauer died of heart failure in 1968.

01:56:45.792 --> 01:56:49.379
Josef Mengele lived undisturbed
in Brazil until his death in 1979.

01:56:49.462 --> 01:56:51.422
He died in a swimming accident.

01:56:54.217 --> 01:56:57.804
The trial is seen as a turning point in the
history of the Federal Republic of Germany.

01:56:57.887 --> 01:57:00.848
The crimes of the Nazi regime
could no longer be suppressed.

01:57:02.308 --> 01:57:06.354
In memory of attorney general Fritz Bauer
and public prosecutors Joachim Kügler,

01:57:06.437 --> 01:57:10.525
Georg Friedrich Vogel, Gerhard Wiese
and journalist Thomas Gnielka.
