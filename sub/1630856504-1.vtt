WEBVTT

00:06.214 --> 00:08.341
They forgot the chicken
in the chicken penne.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.636
What was the dinner
that you took the chicken from?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.137
Chicken spaghetti.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.555
You think that girl could have been

00:14.639 --> 00:17.016
- going through our trash?
- What?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.143
- Hi, Vic.
- Home sweet home.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.645
Right here, pause it.
Pause it.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.313
eLook at how uncomfortable he is.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.856
I thought about going back to New York,

00:23.940 --> 00:25.650
but there's nothing for me there, anyways.

00:25.734 --> 00:28.277
I'm just not any good
when I'm not working, you know.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.737
Hola, Fernando.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.073
We were thinking because the stores

00:32.157 --> 00:35.284
are closed right now,
we might need some security.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.994
Wait. What...
what did they just laugh at?

00:37.078 --> 00:39.664
Fernando fucking up a latte.
It's the only laugh.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.999
Our entire livelihood is based on the fact

00:42.083 --> 00:44.293
that you said they're probably
gonna pick up the series.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.087
Yeah, I know.
But that was before I saw this.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.672
He wasn't funny at all.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.174
Well, this is wack.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.776
Good morning, Martha!

01:50.860 --> 01:54.155
Well, you're a hard guy to get ahold of.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.032
Uh, yeah.
I'm sorry about that.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.200
I was just trying to find
the phone. That's all.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.994
Well, you did it, Dougie.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.662
You did it.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.080
I did.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.832
I did, didn't I?

02:04.916 --> 02:07.793
So, David finally got his eyes on the show

02:07.877 --> 02:10.171
and, um, he loves it.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.756
We're officially ordering

02:11.840 --> 02:13.674
ten episodes of Fliplanthropy...

02:13.758 --> 02:15.342
- Well, that's...
- ...for HGTV Go!

02:15.426 --> 02:17.178
That is such great news, Martha.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.389
And I know you're not gonna...

02:20.807 --> 02:22.350
Fuck!

02:27.021 --> 02:28.314
Come on.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.652
What the fuck?

02:41.077 --> 02:42.328
Come on.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.292
Fuck!

04:12.377 --> 04:13.586
Yo.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.339
Yo.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.522
Motherfucker.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.611
Under the big tree.

04:40.446 --> 04:41.405
The big tree,
I don't know what the fuck

04:41.489 --> 04:42.949
that means, but...

04:58.631 --> 05:00.341
All right.
Let's try you.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.640
Okay.

05:18.901 --> 05:20.278
Nope.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.670
Let's see.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.171
All right.

05:39.255 --> 05:41.340
Number two.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.010
Second time is the charm,
or so they say, right?

05:45.887 --> 05:48.556
There it is.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.809
All right.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.811
Jesus Christ!

05:53.895 --> 05:55.312
Get out of here!

05:55.396 --> 05:57.022
Get the fuck out of here, all right?

05:57.106 --> 05:58.607
Go.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.609
Go.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.486
Come on.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.990
Let me take this, move this here.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.616
All right.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.951
You stay.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.870
This place is fucking disgusting.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.874
All right.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.168
Under the big tree, right?

06:18.252 --> 06:19.545
Under.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.673
All right, let's go.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.511
How deep?

06:27.595 --> 06:30.014
How deep? How deep?
There is deep.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.422
Come on.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.507
Really?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.385
Come on. Nothing?

07:13.683 --> 07:15.101
Come on.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.396
Come on, Dougie.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.773
Come on.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.574
Think.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.618
Big tree. Big tree.

07:34.078 --> 07:35.621
Big tree.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.177
No fucking way.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.183
Of course.
Dougie, there's a reason

07:56.267 --> 07:58.102
you're a fucking genius, right?

08:01.939 --> 08:03.065
This is good.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.234
This is all very good.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.405
All right.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.073
Under.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.950
Under.

08:28.382 --> 08:29.800
It's me.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.357
Okay.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.193
Let's see.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.948
Kalvin, 8:30.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.381
Wyatt, 8:45.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.844
Kalvin and Wyatt.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.691
You guys just have such a thoughtful take

09:27.775 --> 09:30.360
on eco-friendly homes and integrating

09:30.444 --> 09:32.321
your buyers into the communit.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.198
We have nothing like this.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.034
I mean, we're just so excited
to be working with you.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.662
You... you have believed in us
from the very start.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.999
And we could not be more excited
to be in business with you.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.168
I-- I'm sorry.
You should see Asher right now.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.546
He is literally
pretending to play a guitar.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.049
We love that.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.384
I hope to see more of it on the show.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.553
Oh. You'll see more of a lot of stuff.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.722
All G-rated, of course.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.475
I would hope so.

10:01.559 --> 10:04.228
And as we move forward
thinking about the season,

10:04.312 --> 10:06.605
maybe also we aren't focusing so much

10:06.689 --> 10:09.441
on the people
who lived in the homes before.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.778
We love Fernando and his mother, so sweet.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.072
And we think it might be more digestible

10:15.156 --> 10:17.074
and exciting to portray them as people

10:17.158 --> 10:18.784
you're... you're helping in the community

10:18.868 --> 10:20.744
without pointing out
they've been displaced

10:20.828 --> 10:23.038
by your development or,
or development in general.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.831
But... but we don't need
to get into the weeds

10:24.915 --> 10:26.667
with that stuff right now.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.960
It's not something
our viewers wanna engage with.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.628
So, we're excited about that.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.129
That is so exciting.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.340
- That's so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.760
Wow, I can't believe
this is happening to me.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.428
This is... Oh.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.472
We'll set a Zoom with the whole team

10:40.556 --> 10:43.183
to talk more, but we wanted
to give you the headline.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.893
So, congratulations.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.187
Oh. Thank you so much, Martha.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.564
This is... this is really big.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.815
Spank you.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.109
Spank you very much.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.280
Hello. So... sorry.
Hello? Hello?

10:56.364 --> 10:57.864
- Hello.
- Hi. Sorry.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.700
I think you cut out
for a second. I'm sorry.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.952
Just thank you...
thank you so much.

11:02.036 --> 11:04.621
And, um, we will

11:04.705 --> 11:07.541
work on Asher's air guitar for the show.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.626
Fantastic.
Congrats.

11:09.710 --> 11:10.961
- Thank you.
- Okay.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.129
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.505
We'll talk to you soon. Bye.

11:13.589 --> 11:14.757
Ugh.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.219
Did you hear that stuff
that she was saying

11:19.303 --> 11:22.973
- about the displaced residents?
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.641
I mean, I thought
people really liked that stuff.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.977
- Yeah, they did. Yeah.
- They responded to it.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.479
But it's... it's... it's...
Whatever.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.356
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Yeah.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.816
Right? Because it's not
gonna change what we do

11:32.900 --> 11:33.859
in our real life, obviously.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.068
Of course not, no.

11:35.152 --> 11:36.486
- Okay.
- Yeah. Who gives a shit?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.572
Honestly, like, not everything

11:38.656 --> 11:40.198
has to be in the show, you know, like...

11:40.282 --> 11:41.533
Right.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.993
And I think just having a show

11:43.077 --> 11:44.953
is bringing awareness to the area

11:45.037 --> 11:46.204
on these issues, you know?

11:46.288 --> 11:47.873
And maybe it's actually good

11:47.957 --> 11:49.458
because then we can really
feature the homes

11:49.542 --> 11:51.835
and we can, like, push
the environmental aspect

11:51.919 --> 11:53.420
- which is...
- Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.589
- Well, how we started out.
- Yeah.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.965
And the...
and the community is still

11:57.049 --> 11:58.216
gonna be a part of it, obviously.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.801
That's never gonna change, ever.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.303
No.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.430
- Yeah. All right.
- You know,

12:03.514 --> 12:05.932
I wonder if we should delay

12:06.016 --> 12:09.227
listing Juniper Lane
until after the show airs.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.564
I bet we could ask way more for it.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.067
I'm gonna text Ed.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.259
Um, I was talking-- Oh, sorry.

12:41.343 --> 12:42.511
- Are you in the middle...?
- No.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.055
Okay.
I was just gonna say

12:45.139 --> 12:46.932
I was... I was talking to Wendy,

12:47.016 --> 12:51.687
um, and her brother,
I guess, did this corporate

12:51.771 --> 12:54.690
comedy class or something and...

12:54.774 --> 12:58.735
and she said that he found
it super beneficial.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.654
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:02.281 --> 13:05.575
I was just thinking
maybe something like that

13:05.659 --> 13:07.202
would be interesting for you

13:07.286 --> 13:09.413
just so you could feel more confident

13:09.497 --> 13:11.289
in front of the camera,
you know, just because you're...

13:11.373 --> 13:15.293
you're so confident and funny off camera.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.421
Well, if I'm already so funny,

13:17.505 --> 13:20.424
it's just a waste of money then, right?

13:20.508 --> 13:22.426
Yeah.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.178
I mean, but, you know, the focus group,

13:25.262 --> 13:27.514
what they said and maybe-- I know,

13:27.598 --> 13:31.811
but I just... I just
want them to see what I see.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.692
Are you gonna take the classes too?

13:43.364 --> 13:44.824
Maybe. Yeah.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.746
Oh, my God.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.831
Do you think that's
a gift from the network?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.834
Go, go, go, go.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.296
It has to be, but...

13:59.380 --> 14:00.797
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.591
It's Maria, from two blocks over.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.426
Oh, of course.
Uh, Maria, hi.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.094
It's Maria, Whit, from two blocks over.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.138
- Hi.
- Good to see you. How are you?

14:08.222 --> 14:10.640
Hi, Maria. How are you?

14:10.724 --> 14:13.185
Good. Uh, I'm very sorry to bother you,

14:13.269 --> 14:15.437
but I thought you would like to know, um,

14:15.521 --> 14:18.273
the young man who bought
your home on Montana Vista...

14:18.357 --> 14:20.484
- Mm-hmm.
- ...is distributing these notes

14:20.568 --> 14:22.569
to people on the block.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.362
He's accusing us, uh,

14:24.446 --> 14:27.699
all of the neighbors,
of stealing his packages.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.743
What, uh...

14:29.827 --> 14:31.411
"I wanna alert everyone

14:31.495 --> 14:33.246
that there's a package thief
in the neighborhood.

14:33.330 --> 14:34.873
This is the third time
it's happened to me.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.500
If it's one of you that's been doing this,

14:36.584 --> 14:38.251
I understand
it might be an honest mistake.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.003
And if it is returned,
there will be no hard feelings

14:40.087 --> 14:41.505
or consequences.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.256
Thank you.
Your new neighbor, Victor."

14:43.340 --> 14:48.011
I... I... I'm so sorry, Maria.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.847
I will go talk to him immediately.

14:50.931 --> 14:54.810
It's just that you assured us
that the people you brought

14:54.894 --> 14:58.230
into this neighborhood would be
in harmony with the community.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.774
- Yes.
- And those exact words.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.069
And we don't know
anything about his packages.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.029
Of course not.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.198
We will handle this, Maria.
I... I promise you.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.158
I'm so sorry this happened.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.868
- Thank you again.
- Hi.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.537
You are currently being recorded.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.830
Have a good day.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.206
It's nice to see you.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.833
It's just the... the door.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.919
We don't look at the footage from that.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.381
Can you believe that?

15:24.465 --> 15:25.924
- Are... are you gonna--
- Yes.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.217
Are you gonna talk to him?

15:27.301 --> 15:29.135
Of course.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.930
I was thinking, um, you know,
once we close on Palmer Lane,

15:32.014 --> 15:33.557
we're gonna have some extra cash.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.058
I should probably pull the trigger

15:35.142 --> 15:37.394
on that augmented reality guy, right?

15:37.478 --> 15:39.938
It'd be amazing if he could do
a mockup of Loma Vista

15:40.022 --> 15:42.941
that we could feature in the show.

15:43.025 --> 15:46.152
Yeah. Do we... do we have to
talk about this now?

15:46.236 --> 15:47.821
Sweetie, I can't find
my hat and I feel like...

15:47.905 --> 15:49.573
- It's just that...
- ...it was in here somewhere.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.241
It's just that our contact, you know...

15:51.325 --> 15:53.159
- Oh.
- ...for him is through Vic.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.329
And we're getting a significant
discount because of that.

15:56.413 --> 15:58.081
- Mm-hmm.
- So, you know,

15:58.165 --> 16:00.125
I don't know what you're
planning on saying to him,

16:00.209 --> 16:02.878
but, you know, I just don't
wanna lose the discount.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.922
Relax. I'm not gonna
punch him in the face.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.717
There are tons of people
who do AR, by the way.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.969
I know. This guy is just
really good at incorporating

16:11.053 --> 16:14.139
- natural light and...
- Sure. Yeah.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.725
- Yup, yup.
- The discount is significant.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.268
- Yeah.
- Um, I mean,

16:18.352 --> 16:20.145
also I think it would be a great way

16:20.229 --> 16:22.940
to premiere your new design.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.153
I love you.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.322
I love you.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.353
Hi, Angelica.

17:20.247 --> 17:21.873
Canelo. Canelo.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.833
Canelo. Canelo.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.544
Come here. Come here.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.965
Okay.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.508
Hi. I'm Whitney.
We live at the end of the block.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.510
- Bye-bye.
- I don't think I met you yet.

17:33.594 --> 17:34.803
I met your wife, Barbara.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.096
- Oh, yes.
- What's your name?

17:36.180 --> 17:38.556
- Leo.
- Leo. Nice to meet you.

17:38.640 --> 17:40.684
Oh.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.602
Say hi to Barbara.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.728
I will.

17:43.812 --> 17:46.064
It's such a beautiful day.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.524
So nice.

17:47.608 --> 17:48.775
Bye, buddy.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.242
The big news

17:57.326 --> 17:58.868
that is completely

17:58.952 --> 18:00.704
being ignored

18:00.788 --> 18:04.040
is what's happening

18:04.124 --> 18:06.626
in gold stocks and in gold.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.337
I mean, today, the GDX index

18:09.421 --> 18:11.715
of gold miners

18:11.799 --> 18:13.717
hit a new high for the year.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.177
In fact, it's at a new seven-year high

18:16.261 --> 18:18.555
and if you look at how much

18:18.639 --> 18:20.932
the index has moved up since its March low

18:21.016 --> 18:23.226
of about a month ago,

18:23.310 --> 18:25.937
The index has now doubled.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.856
So gold stocks

18:27.940 --> 18:31.067
have doubled in price

18:31.151 --> 18:33.028
in a month.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.739
Now, granted they doubled
from a price that

18:35.823 --> 18:38.116
was low because they went down...

19:32.588 --> 19:34.130
Oh. Hey, Whitney.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.757
- What's poppin'?
- Hi, Vic.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.801
Um, I was just strolling
in the neighborhood

19:37.885 --> 19:39.803
and I thought I'd check in.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.805
Um... Oh!

19:41.889 --> 19:43.264
We... we haven't told you yet.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.849
Our show got picked up to series.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.310
- Oh, congrats.
- Yeah.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.145
- It's very exciting.
- You don't need me

19:49.229 --> 19:51.189
for anything else, do you?

19:51.273 --> 19:53.316
No, no.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.151
Not if you don't want to. No.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.487
Yeah,
I'd prefer maybe no.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.572
- Hmm.
- Just wanna get settle in.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.241
We can talk about it later.

20:01.325 --> 20:05.036
Um, I noticed
the induction stove out there.

20:05.120 --> 20:08.581
Uh, yeah,
I swapped it out for a gas one.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.126
- I do a lot of stir fry.
- Mmm.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.422
You know, with a gas unit,

20:16.506 --> 20:22.011
this house no longer qualifies as passive.

20:22.095 --> 20:24.556
Ah, I didn't know that.

20:25.891 --> 20:30.019
So you're venting
the air then to the outside?

20:30.103 --> 20:31.688
The home is its own ecosystem.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.232
It's not designed for a gas stove.

20:34.316 --> 20:38.069
Well, I figured since it's my home,

20:38.153 --> 20:40.322
I just wanna make it how I love it.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.158
Yes, I am venting.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.036
Okay, good.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.789
So I, um, I heard

20:49.873 --> 20:51.666
that you're having an issue

20:51.750 --> 20:55.378
with packages going missing?

20:55.462 --> 20:57.505
Yeah, three of them.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.633
I feel very welcome here.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.385
I think everyone is just doing their best.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.637
And I know a lot of the neighbors

21:04.721 --> 21:05.930
share your concerns.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.724
Then why are they stealing them?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.559
And I really... I...

21:09.643 --> 21:11.978
I think you're handling it very well

21:12.062 --> 21:14.147
because you're alerting the neighborhood

21:14.231 --> 21:16.608
and you're not calling the police.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.485
Right?

21:19.569 --> 21:21.112
I haven't yet, no.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.614
Hmm.

21:22.698 --> 21:26.075
That's good because
there's really no reason

21:26.159 --> 21:27.952
to do something like that
over something like this.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.997
I mean, Amazon is not
gonna charge you, obviously.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.999
It was an Alienware computer.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.459
It didn't come from Amazon,

21:34.543 --> 21:36.294
and they're not giving me a refund

21:36.378 --> 21:37.962
because they said it was delivered.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.298
- So...
- Mm-hmm.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.926
I would just think about the language

21:43.010 --> 21:45.845
that you're using

21:45.929 --> 21:48.348
to alert the community because it could be

21:48.432 --> 21:51.351
misinterpreted as an accusation.

21:51.435 --> 21:52.686
You know what I mean?

21:55.731 --> 22:00.151
Um, okay, well, uh, it's good to see you.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.611
- Yeah.
- Have a good day.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.280
I gotta look up that Alienware stuff.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.282
- That's so cool.
- Yeah.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.867
I guess you really can learn

22:07.951 --> 22:09.327
some things from your neighbors, huh?

22:09.411 --> 22:11.996
- Mm-hmm. Okay.
- Have a good day, Vic.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.831
Yeah. Bye, Whitney.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.124
Bye-bye.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.948
- Hey. How did it go?
- Hi.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.201
Uh, Vic threw out his induction range

22:50.285 --> 22:51.911
and he replaced it with a gas stove.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.372
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.332
There has to be some type of clause

22:56.416 --> 22:57.792
that you can put in the contract

22:57.876 --> 23:00.086
that prevents buyers from ruining

23:00.170 --> 23:01.671
the passive home certification.

23:01.755 --> 23:04.007
- There has to be.
- I just don't think

23:04.091 --> 23:05.800
you can put anything
in a purchase agreement

23:05.884 --> 23:07.885
that prevents people

23:07.969 --> 23:10.305
from making changes
after we close. I mean...

23:10.389 --> 23:13.182
- But we...
- We can try to,

23:13.266 --> 23:15.184
you know, encourage that behavior, but--

23:15.268 --> 23:16.769
Then we need to be more discerning

23:16.853 --> 23:18.730
about who we're selling these homes to.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.275
People like Vic just do not deserve

23:22.359 --> 23:25.361
to be part of what we're building.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.072
But it ended okay, right?

23:28.156 --> 23:30.700
His... his nose is broken, but he'll live.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.285
Yeah.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.037
Don't worry.
We'll... we'll... we'll find

23:34.121 --> 23:35.246
the right people for this.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.081
I... I promise, okay, babe?

23:37.165 --> 23:38.374
For real.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.793
This is real now, you know?

23:40.877 --> 23:43.171
It's gonna be a lot of eyes on Española

23:43.255 --> 23:45.131
and on us.

23:45.215 --> 23:48.176
Oh, my God, he didn't even try
to sell the range.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.886
He just threw it out.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.637
Fucking stir fry.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.724
Oh, my God, the privilege.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.851
It's a $7,000 range.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.436
Yeah, I know.
And he... and he put it

23:58.520 --> 23:59.896
right next to the recycling bin

23:59.980 --> 24:01.064
which I thought was hilarious.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.441
Like, "Oh, he recycles."

24:03.400 --> 24:04.942
Is it damaged?

24:05.026 --> 24:06.861
No, it's in perfect condition.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.156
It's just sitting next
to a bunch of garbage bins.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.908
Oh, God.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.534
Anyway, all right,
I'll be home soon.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.286
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.622
Okay, bye. Love you.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.479
Hello.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.565
Yes, sorry to bother you

25:25.649 --> 25:29.652
but, um, I have some car keys here.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.321
And I'm wondering if somebody
here owns a big Mercedes.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.365
Oh, okay.

25:34.449 --> 25:36.076
I got it!

25:49.256 --> 25:51.800
What the fuck, man?
You said 8:30.

25:53.593 --> 25:54.844
I'm here, aren't I?

25:54.928 --> 25:56.220
Did you bring my car?

25:56.304 --> 25:57.680
- Kalvin!
- No.

25:57.764 --> 25:58.931
Give me the keys, quick.

25:59.015 --> 26:00.850
Kalvin, where is your car?

26:00.934 --> 26:02.518
- Kalvin?
- Don't worry, Mom, I got it.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.187
- It's just a delivery.
- Who is this man?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.688
He's an Uber messenger.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.857
Are you an Uber messenger?

26:07.941 --> 26:10.193
Yes.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.320
Okay. You know what,
if somebody doesn't tell me

26:12.404 --> 26:14.864
what's going on right now,
I'm calling the police.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.075
Kalvin!

26:18.702 --> 26:19.869
I don't know, Mom.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.871
He... he came to our school

26:21.955 --> 26:23.414
and started lecturing us outside

26:23.498 --> 26:25.208
about how his wife died drunk driving

26:25.292 --> 26:27.543
and then he tried to buy us beer
to teach us a lesson.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.962
You bought my son beer?

26:30.046 --> 26:32.882
Yes, I did, um, but they were asking me

26:32.966 --> 26:34.634
to buy them beer
outside of the liquor store.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.969
No, we didn't.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.262
You did.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.722
You were asking everyone who went inside

26:39.806 --> 26:41.224
if they would buy it for you.

26:41.308 --> 26:44.393
And... and the only reason that I did it

26:44.477 --> 26:46.646
was to supervise them, okay?

26:46.730 --> 26:48.940
And I made sure that they
gave me all of their car keys

26:49.024 --> 26:51.067
before I bought them the beer.
Look, look, look.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.110
How else would I have this, huh?

26:53.194 --> 26:54.946
Kalvin and your address.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.656
There it is right there.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.367
Huh?

27:00.827 --> 27:02.495
So you bought my son alcohol?

27:02.579 --> 27:04.622
You're lucky I was the one
who bought him alcohol,

27:04.706 --> 27:06.707
you know that?
You're lucky because otherwise

27:06.791 --> 27:08.417
he'd might be dead in a ditch somewhere.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.628
Dude, you stole my car and bought me beer.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.963
I'm a... I'm a minor.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.589
Such a baby. Sorry.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.092
Look, you can go crime
for crime if you want,

27:16.176 --> 27:17.593
all right, because I don't care.

27:17.677 --> 27:18.970
My life's over essentially.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.888
Anyways, he looks like a young man,

27:20.972 --> 27:22.765
young boy who wants
to go to college, right?

27:22.849 --> 27:24.559
I don't think...
I don't think a college

27:24.643 --> 27:26.143
is gonna want a criminal record on there,

27:26.227 --> 27:28.062
all right?
So you think about that

27:28.146 --> 27:29.897
because the only school
he's gonna be able to get into

27:29.981 --> 27:32.275
is Albuquerque
Community College, all right?

27:32.359 --> 27:34.402
I hear they have a good janitor program.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.445
Kalvin, do you know
where your car is? Answer me.

27:36.529 --> 27:37.947
Cleaning up shit for the rest
of his life. Excuse my language.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.323
- Do you know where your car is?
- Yes.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.950
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.285
- Please, leave.
- I appreciate the thank you

27:42.369 --> 27:43.786
- but you're welcome.
- Thank you.

27:43.870 --> 27:45.121
I'd like a thank you from him, please.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.998
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.293
All right. But my morning
is already ruined, okay?

27:50.377 --> 27:51.961
Believe it or not,
I have a job to do.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.462
I'm a TV producer.

27:53.546 --> 27:54.630
Okay.

27:54.714 --> 27:55.840
And my show just got picked up

27:55.924 --> 27:57.592
for ten episodes to series.

28:01.221 --> 28:02.471
Spoiled brat.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.439
- Hi, Abshir.
- Hello.

28:11.523 --> 28:12.815
- How are you?
- Good.

28:12.899 --> 28:14.609
Good? I got some, uh,

28:14.693 --> 28:17.153
goodies from the pantry for you.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.155
Oh, I get so much food

28:19.239 --> 28:20.656
from the grocery store, but thanks.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.825
Yeah. And Whitney got some supplements

28:22.909 --> 28:24.493
- for your neck pain.
- Yeah.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.120
So that's in here, too.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.165
Um, I, uh, I do have to, uh,

28:29.249 --> 28:30.875
come in to do a mold test.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.460
Oh, really?

28:32.544 --> 28:33.961
Yeah, it won't be long at all.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.171
You have to?

28:35.255 --> 28:37.048
As the owner of the property,

28:37.132 --> 28:40.551
if there is mold, you know,
that's a liability for me,

28:40.635 --> 28:42.345
so I do need to do it.

28:42.429 --> 28:43.929
Or else you could sue me.

28:44.013 --> 28:45.348
I'm not gonna sue you.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.682
No, no,
I know you won't sue me,

28:46.766 --> 28:48.184
but you could.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.186
So, um...

28:50.270 --> 28:51.771
- Okay.
- Yeah, but I won't be long.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.732
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, all right.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.026
- More goodies here.
- Okay.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.070
Do you like these beet chips?

29:08.329 --> 29:10.206
You guys eat a lot of pasta?

29:11.624 --> 29:14.252
Not me. She loves it.

29:15.336 --> 29:17.922
Oh, yeah?

29:18.006 --> 29:21.842
Nala, what's your favorite kind of pasta?

29:21.926 --> 29:23.595
Spaghetti.

29:24.637 --> 29:25.972
Spaghetti?

29:27.515 --> 29:29.058
Do you like penne?

29:30.268 --> 29:31.603
What's penne?

29:37.400 --> 29:38.943
That's macaroni.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.765
Kinda gross, huh?

30:09.849 --> 30:11.893
- Yeah.
- Yucky.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.444
How does that work?

30:21.528 --> 30:22.945
How does this work?

30:23.029 --> 30:26.115
I'm taking a sample with this Q-tip

30:26.199 --> 30:28.033
of all the gucky stuff

30:28.117 --> 30:30.077
and this is gonna go off to the lab

30:30.161 --> 30:32.830
and then they're gonna
tell us in a week or so

30:32.914 --> 30:36.876
if there's anything bad
in there or if it's fine.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.711
Pretty neat, huh?

30:38.795 --> 30:40.546
You like science?

30:40.630 --> 30:42.465
- Yes.
- Okay.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.676
Do you know what this is called?

30:46.094 --> 30:48.220
A Petri dish.

30:48.304 --> 30:50.723
So, we have to take the lid off

30:50.807 --> 30:54.226
and then we're going
to leave it just over here,

30:54.310 --> 30:55.853
so it sits right here

30:55.937 --> 30:58.147
and it has to stay for 48 hours.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.523
And then it's gonna test the air

30:59.607 --> 31:02.318
for, um, contaminants.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.986
And then maybe once we got the results,

31:04.070 --> 31:06.489
you can bring it into school
and you can say

31:06.573 --> 31:09.200
Uncle Asher helped you make it,

31:09.284 --> 31:11.494
if you want.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.288
Pretty cool, huh?

31:16.165 --> 31:19.752
Oh, I watched, uh,
some of those Tiny Curse videos.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.253
They're pretty cool.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.172
I saw one where a kid's homework

31:23.256 --> 31:26.884
disappeared and then turned into a DVD

31:26.968 --> 31:29.011
of the show 60 Minutes.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.181
So that's a real curse.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.892
What's 60 Minutes?

31:35.268 --> 31:38.145
Um, it's a news magazine.

31:38.229 --> 31:41.106
Um...

31:41.190 --> 31:45.027
It's a show for us old...
old geezers like me.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.947
Oh, oh, I'm so old.

31:48.031 --> 31:51.283
- That's not funny.
- Hi, I'm old.

31:51.367 --> 31:53.202
Ha-ha, you're so funny.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.496
You don't find this funny?

31:55.580 --> 31:57.206
- No.
- Hey,

31:57.290 --> 32:00.167
you should let me paint your nails.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.794
Okay.
You wanna paint my nails?

32:01.878 --> 32:02.878
Mm-hmm.

32:02.962 --> 32:04.255
I'd love that.

32:04.339 --> 32:05.756
Wait, did you do it on yourself?

32:05.840 --> 32:07.049
Yes.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.801
Just one nail.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.053
Hmm,
I could just have one.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.721
Okay. Which one are you gonna start with?

32:12.805 --> 32:14.557
- This one.
- I'd like to show you something.

32:14.641 --> 32:15.933
Okay. Right now?

32:16.017 --> 32:17.644
Yeah.

32:27.612 --> 32:31.115
Can you please, let's just
stop discussing curses

32:31.199 --> 32:33.617
- anywhere around here.
- Oh, it's a TikTok trend.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.077
She told me it's a TikTok trend.

32:35.161 --> 32:37.580
I know it's a trend, but it's...

32:37.664 --> 32:39.164
I had to work very hard for her

32:39.248 --> 32:40.666
to stop talking about it.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.127
And where I'm from,
we don't play with that.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.795
Just so, please, just stop it.

32:44.879 --> 32:47.047
Of course, of course. Um...

32:47.131 --> 32:48.299
Yeah.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.678
Do you mind if I ask where you're from?

32:52.762 --> 32:54.597
Uh, Minnesota.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.808
- Minnesota. Okay.
- Hmm.

32:57.892 --> 32:59.143
And...

33:00.144 --> 33:02.396
you, um...

33:02.480 --> 33:05.441
your culture, you believe in,

33:05.525 --> 33:09.570
um, curses or, uh...

33:09.654 --> 33:11.530
- No, no, no.
- Oh, okay.

33:11.614 --> 33:14.658
But if you put an idea in your head,

33:14.742 --> 33:17.202
it can become very real.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.371
And she's...
she's just a young girl.

33:19.455 --> 33:20.956
- Of course. Yeah, yeah.
- You know?

33:21.040 --> 33:22.291
Just... I want it to be stopped.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.876
No, of course, yes.
No problem.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.794
Yeah. We appreciate
everything you're doing,

33:25.878 --> 33:27.296
but just keep that at it.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.131
Just-- thanks.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.634
Of course.
Oh, you wanted to show me

33:31.718 --> 33:33.469
- something in here?
- Oh, it's nothing.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.942
♪ Upbeat music plays over stereo ♪

34:21.893 --> 34:24.353
Make sure not to catch
yourself in the reflection.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.938
Shoot from an angle.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.941
Okay.

34:29.942 --> 34:32.444
Do you, um...

34:32.528 --> 34:35.447
You spoke to Fernando yesterday, right?

34:35.531 --> 34:36.907
Yeah. He's really nice.

34:36.991 --> 34:38.534
We actually talked for a long time.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.079
Great.
Uh, did you see his belt?

34:42.371 --> 34:44.540
Um, he... he still has it.

34:44.624 --> 34:46.083
Did you tell him not to bring it?

34:46.167 --> 34:47.876
I talked to him about it

34:47.960 --> 34:51.380
but he didn't really answer me
when I asked him, so...

34:51.464 --> 34:53.716
Did you say
that it makes us uncomfortable?

34:53.800 --> 34:55.718
I said that it made you uncomfortable.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.015
Do you want me to talk to him again?

35:01.099 --> 35:02.349
That would be great.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.184
Yeah, if you don't mind.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.894
The coffee shop's reopening soon anyway,

35:05.978 --> 35:08.188
so we don't even need
him doing security anymore.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.066
Yeah. Thanks so much.

35:36.425 --> 35:38.678
Okay, cool. Let me know.

35:39.679 --> 35:40.971
Thank you. All right.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.390
Hello?

35:47.937 --> 35:49.772
I told him not to bring the gun anymore

35:49.856 --> 35:50.982
and he said, "Okay."

36:16.382 --> 36:17.966
Is he getting in his car?

36:18.050 --> 36:19.968
He's getting in right now.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.664
Okay. Let's go.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.666
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.501
Wait, wait, wait.

36:52.585 --> 36:54.753
I can't be seen in his security camera.

36:54.837 --> 36:57.589
Um, here, let me get out
and you can do it,

36:57.673 --> 36:59.174
and I'll meet you around the corner, okay?

36:59.258 --> 37:00.717
Oh, fuck.

37:00.801 --> 37:02.052
Sorry, sorry, I dented it.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.846
You're against a wall.
It's fine.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.097
There's probably no scratch there.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.557
Just back up so I can get out.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.016
That won't be easy for me to do, boss.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.185
These things are heavy.

37:10.269 --> 37:11.478
- Besides, it's garbage.
- It's...

37:11.562 --> 37:13.480
Who cares if we're taking it?

37:13.564 --> 37:16.733
It's unprofessional to be seen
on camera taking it.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.195
Here, just back up so I can get out.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.913
Just duck down in the back.

38:32.768 --> 38:34.561
I can't do this alone.
Can I get your help?

38:34.645 --> 38:36.480
Come on, man.
You're fucking jacked.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.065
You got this.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.608
You can do it.
You can do it on your own.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.110
Trust me.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.497
It fell.

38:54.540 --> 38:56.291
Oh, goddamn it, Freckle.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.501
Just leave it, let's go.

38:57.585 --> 38:59.169
Let me put it back on the curb.

38:59.253 --> 39:00.796
Just leave it.
It's fine. Just leave it.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.340
Oh, gosh.

39:08.262 --> 39:10.138
Go, go. Come on, Freckle.

39:10.222 --> 39:11.474
Hurry up.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.535
See, it's tough.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.495
The whole show is integrating
the two buyers

39:33.579 --> 39:35.330
into the community, so...

39:35.414 --> 39:37.165
I know, but Whitney doesn't wanna use Vic

39:37.249 --> 39:38.667
for anything beyond the pilot.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.335
And that's, like, for sure, for sure.

39:40.419 --> 39:43.463
So, can you do it
with our Palmer Lane buyers,

39:43.547 --> 39:44.631
Dennis and Lucinda?

39:44.715 --> 39:46.675
Yeah. I guess so.

39:46.759 --> 39:48.302
I just thought Vic would be pretty funny

39:48.386 --> 39:50.846
because, um, he's single.

39:50.930 --> 39:53.307
So, him at a fiesta would be kind of...

39:53.391 --> 39:55.434
I mean, he was also racist
to the entire neighborhood,

39:55.518 --> 39:57.602
so I don't think we can use him.

39:57.686 --> 39:59.938
Come on.
That's the kind of stuff

40:00.022 --> 40:01.398
I want in the show, man.

40:01.482 --> 40:02.858
Racism?

40:02.942 --> 40:05.277
No, but, like, conflict.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.362
I'm sure you can make,
uh, with your skills,

40:07.446 --> 40:10.741
Dennis and Lucinda seem racist, too, so...

40:10.825 --> 40:12.451
I'm obviously joking.

40:12.535 --> 40:14.286
Don't tempt me there.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.247
All right. Fine. No Vic.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.250
Look at us, huh?

40:25.506 --> 40:26.631
Making a TV show.

40:26.715 --> 40:27.924
Yeah.

40:28.008 --> 40:30.093
Boys are back.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.262
Asher and Big D back on the lake.

40:32.346 --> 40:34.432
Back on the lake.

40:40.688 --> 40:41.981
Look, man...

40:44.984 --> 40:47.069
I just wanna say I'm sorry,

40:47.153 --> 40:49.363
you know, for bullying you
all those years at camp.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.409
You never bullied me.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.119
There was the time at Sports World

40:56.203 --> 41:00.415
where we ditched you and
the pantsing at the swim meet.

41:00.499 --> 41:02.668
Uh, we were just joking around.

41:05.504 --> 41:07.005
Yeah, right?

41:07.089 --> 41:09.925
- Yeah.
- It was fun.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.427
All right. Look, the point I was
trying to make about Vic was

41:12.511 --> 41:14.846
just because Whitney has a moral issue

41:14.930 --> 41:17.099
with something that's happening,

41:17.183 --> 41:19.643
we just toss it away?

41:19.727 --> 41:22.646
Come on. You know our show
barely got picked up, right?

41:22.730 --> 41:25.190
- Really? The show?
- Yeah. Yes.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.650
The pilot could have been so good.

41:26.734 --> 41:29.111
You had you with the reporter, right?

41:29.195 --> 41:31.029
Chasing her around,
the little girl cursing you,

41:31.113 --> 41:33.782
the yogurt argument, all that stuff,

41:33.866 --> 41:36.034
we're letting them go,
throwing them in the trash.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.495
You know how hard it is to get that stuff?

41:38.579 --> 41:40.455
I don't know.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.499
I'm just trying to protect
what we've got here.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.626
And you know Whitney better than me,

41:44.710 --> 41:47.546
so, what can we do about it, right?

41:47.630 --> 41:50.549
Yeah. Well...

41:50.633 --> 41:52.342
my only advice would be to get used to it

41:52.426 --> 41:55.846
'cause she's not gonna change.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.139
Oh, great.

42:00.893 --> 42:02.310
What is this stuff?

42:02.394 --> 42:04.688
Oh, Stars and Stripes.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.231
Two-and-a-half-liter bottle.

42:06.315 --> 42:08.150
Local cola,

42:08.234 --> 42:10.902
about a dollar-ish.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.487
Maybe buck twenty-five, dollar-thirty,

42:12.571 --> 42:13.864
depending on where you shop.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.243
It's kind of crazy actually.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.038
The girl that did that curse thing...

42:23.165 --> 42:25.876
she was actually living
in one of the houses we bought.

42:25.960 --> 42:28.045
That's crazy.
Here. Let me have one.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.090
What do you think of this jacket?

42:32.174 --> 42:33.425
- Good?
- Nice, yeah.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.010
I can pull it off.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.344
Seventeen hundred bucks.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.513
It's a lot.
Yeah, it's nice.

42:38.597 --> 42:39.890
Cool.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.853
It's actually kind of funny, I...

42:44.937 --> 42:48.023
so I said to her, the girl,

42:48.107 --> 42:51.234
as like a joke,
I was, like, "Oh,

42:51.318 --> 42:53.570
what was the curse you did to me?"

42:53.654 --> 42:55.030
And, uh...

42:56.657 --> 42:58.742
she told me

42:58.826 --> 43:02.037
that she took the chicken
out of our pasta.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.538
But the night she did that,

43:03.622 --> 43:07.250
there's actually chicken
missing from our pasta.

43:07.334 --> 43:10.420
We had a chicken pasta
from our delivery thing.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.005
- Hmm.
- It's, like,

43:12.089 --> 43:13.591
what are the odds?

43:15.467 --> 43:18.971
So she... she said that
and then that happened, huh?

43:19.888 --> 43:21.307
Yeah.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.520
Well, it happened before.

43:27.813 --> 43:31.650
But I guess she thought it...
I don't know.

43:37.072 --> 43:38.282
What is it?

43:40.159 --> 43:42.703
Let me show you something.
Come here.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.084
- Can I sit?
- Yeah, yeah.

43:55.799 --> 43:57.134
Here, watch this.

43:58.636 --> 44:01.346
I curse you.

44:01.430 --> 44:03.807
Okay. Okay.

44:03.891 --> 44:05.642
- I'm gonna go get-- okay?
- You hear that?

44:05.726 --> 44:08.478
So I'll be right-- just stay here.

44:08.562 --> 44:10.272
I'm getting change.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.484
I curse you.

44:14.568 --> 44:16.444
Okay.

44:16.528 --> 44:17.946
Okay. I'm gonna go get-- okay?

44:18.030 --> 44:19.739
- The static?
- Yeah.

44:19.823 --> 44:21.199
Yeah. Right after she said, "I curse you,"

44:21.283 --> 44:23.160
it went...

44:25.204 --> 44:28.123
Isn't that just interference,
though, from the distance?

44:28.207 --> 44:30.000
Because I was far away from you guys.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.967
Look, I'm debating whether
I have to even tell you or not

44:39.051 --> 44:40.344
but...

44:42.680 --> 44:43.889
What?

44:55.901 --> 44:57.194
I was cursed.

44:59.822 --> 45:01.031
I'm serious.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.452
What? Wait, by who?

45:05.536 --> 45:07.037
I don't know.

45:07.121 --> 45:08.872
There's nobody that in particular

45:08.956 --> 45:12.334
that I can point to, but...

45:12.418 --> 45:14.669
there's no other way
I can explain what happened...

45:14.753 --> 45:18.048
with, um, Melanie.

45:20.092 --> 45:22.636
Oh. I thought... I thought
it was an accident.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.555
It was. It was, but...

45:25.639 --> 45:27.682
I happened to be drunk that night.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.560
Nothing, nothing makes sense.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.063
And then...

45:35.399 --> 45:37.735
I'm not-- I don't wanna talk
about this anymore, all right?

46:01.341 --> 46:02.884
Okay. So I'll be right--

46:02.968 --> 46:04.678
just stay here.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.430
I'm getting change.

46:08.140 --> 46:11.601
Okay.
Okay. I'm gonna go get-- okay?

46:11.685 --> 46:14.521
So I'll be right--
just stay here.

46:14.605 --> 46:16.022
I'm getting change.

46:36.251 --> 46:39.087
Breathe in and out.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.612
Um, is it possible to pre-pay

47:04.696 --> 47:06.406
for an appointment for someone else?

47:06.490 --> 47:07.574
Yes. Absolutely.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.368
Do they have insurance?

47:10.494 --> 47:11.995
Let's assume not.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.665
And then I'll just cover the whole thing.

48:18.103 --> 48:20.855
- Would you like to join us?
- Oh, that's okay.

48:20.939 --> 48:22.732
- I could just watch.
- Okay.

50:33.238 --> 50:36.533
♪ Suspenseful music ♪

50:40.912 --> 50:44.248
So with a younger workforce
coming into the corporate world,

50:44.332 --> 50:46.042
ironically, there are gonna be
a lot more words

50:46.126 --> 50:47.752
that we're gonna need to avoid.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.545
But the good news is, sometimes,

50:49.629 --> 50:52.382
uh, some of the funniest jokes
that we tell,

50:52.466 --> 50:55.009
we don't even know
why we're laughing, right?

50:55.093 --> 50:57.261
We don't even need words, right?

50:57.345 --> 50:59.639
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go around the circle

50:59.723 --> 51:01.182
and then we're gonna
try to see if we can make

51:01.266 --> 51:03.017
the whole group laugh...

51:03.101 --> 51:05.019
not using any words, okay?

51:05.103 --> 51:07.230
No words. So I'll go first.

51:10.525 --> 51:13.194
Yeah? All right.

51:13.278 --> 51:14.862
All right. Sarah, we're
gonna go-- you're gonna go next,

51:14.946 --> 51:17.240
and then we're gonna go clockwise.

51:20.202 --> 51:21.703
That's great.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.080
That's great.

51:26.458 --> 51:29.086
Uh-huh. Okay. Next.

51:32.297 --> 51:34.341
That's great, that's hilarious, go ahead.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.927
Don't worry about it.
Everybody's here,

51:38.011 --> 51:39.804
you know, we're supporting you.

51:39.888 --> 51:41.723
No wrong choices, go ahead.

51:41.807 --> 51:44.600
Oh.

51:44.684 --> 51:46.353
Hilarious.
Okay, go ahead.

51:47.687 --> 51:49.022
Yeah.

51:50.857 --> 51:52.900
That's great.

51:52.984 --> 51:54.569
That's hilarious. Yeah.

52:02.035 --> 52:03.953
That's great, yeah. Next.

52:09.584 --> 52:10.961
Uh, next.

52:20.011 --> 52:21.972
Okay. Go ahead.

52:29.271 --> 52:30.772
Go ahead.

52:30.856 --> 52:32.815
Yeah.

52:32.899 --> 52:34.234
That's hilarious.

52:41.283 --> 52:42.534
Great, yeah.

52:45.078 --> 52:47.413
Awww.

52:47.497 --> 52:49.249
Fuckin' comedy.

53:19.571 --> 53:23.908
Okay, last...

53:23.992 --> 53:26.327
That's great, guys.
Good job, that's hilarious.

53:26.411 --> 53:28.079
Give yourselves a round of applause.

53:28.163 --> 53:29.163
Good job, everybody.

53:29.247 --> 53:30.874
Great.
