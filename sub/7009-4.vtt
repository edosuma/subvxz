11:02.161 --> 11:03.411
DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY AIR HOCKEY?

11:03.621 --> 11:04.996
WITH YOU?

11:05.206 --> 11:07.207
OH, I'D LOVE TO,
BUT, UH...

11:07.416 --> 11:08.583
I'M KIND OF TIRED.

11:08.793 --> 11:09.626
AND MY WRIST HURTS.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.295
AND I THINK
I'M COMING DOWN WITH THE FLU.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.171
WELL,
IT'S JUST AS WELL.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.799
I'M PRETTY BAD
AT IT.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.468
YOU KNOW, ONE GAME
ISN'T GOING TO KILL ME.

11:19.428 --> 11:19.969
ALRIGHT,
YOU SERVE FIRST.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.513
OKAY.

11:23.557 --> 11:24.391
WHOA!

11:24.600 --> 11:25.975
NO WAY YOU COULD
STOP THAT.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.104
THAT WAS GOING SO FAST,
YOU COULDN'T EVEN SEE THAT.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.152
I SAW THAT.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.584
WHOO.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.128
WELL, THAT'S GAME.

11:58.926 --> 12:01.845
THAT'S...

12:02.054 --> 12:04.931
THAT'S GREAT.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.850
ARE YOU OK WITH THAT?

12:07.059 --> 12:08.685
SURE.

12:26.328 --> 12:27.662
BINGO.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.375
AH, CRAP.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.585
NO, NO, NO.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.587
NOW LOOK, WE JUST WILL
GET RID OF THESE CHAIRS,

12:35.796 --> 12:37.338
AND WE WILL SIT
ON THE FLOOR

12:37.548 --> 12:39.174
LIKE THOSE NICE
JAPANESE PEOPLE

12:39.383 --> 12:43.636
IN FLOWER DRUM SONG.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.513
I'LL HAVE TO MAKE NEW LEGS
FOR THE DAMN THING.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.890
I'LL BE IN THE GARAGE
IF YOU NEED ME.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.185
OK, WELL, NOW, YOU TAKE
YOUR TIME AND YOU DO A GOOD JOB.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.936
YOU CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.688
SHH!

12:56.567 --> 12:56.983
I MEAN, IF...

12:57.193 --> 12:59.986
SHH, SHH.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.321
IS IT ME...

13:01.530 --> 13:04.449
OR IS THAT REFRIGERATOR
TOO LOUD?

13:08.829 --> 13:11.080
WHAT REFRIGERATOR?

13:11.290 --> 13:14.000
RED, THERE IS NO NOISE.
THERE IS NO NOISE.

13:16.003 --> 13:16.961
♪ YOU'LL BE SWELL ♪

13:17.171 --> 13:18.671
♪ YOU'LL BE GREAT ♪

13:18.881 --> 13:21.841
♪ GONNA HAVE THE
WHOLE WORLD ON A PLATE ♪

13:31.936 --> 13:34.020
HEY, NICE SHOT.

13:34.230 --> 13:34.938
THANKS.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.397
YOU WANNA PLAY?

13:36.607 --> 13:38.191
I DON'T KNOW.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.277
OK. WHY NOT?

13:41.487 --> 13:44.405
LOOK, GAME TO 21.
I'LL TAKE IT OUT FIRST.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.662
HAVE YOU BEEN
PRACTICING?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.705
WELL...

13:52.915 --> 13:55.250
A LITTLE.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.554
MY GOODNESS,
WHAT A SUPER SHOT.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.098
DONNA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:10.307 --> 14:12.308
I'M...

14:12.518 --> 14:15.144
LOSING TO YOU, YOU BIG,
STRONG GRIZZLY BEAR.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.646
RRAAARRR...

14:21.902 --> 14:24.153
DONNA, YOU'RE INTENTIONALLY
THROWING THE GAME.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.822
I'M THROWING
THE GAME?

14:26.031 --> 14:26.948
DONNA?

14:27.157 --> 14:29.492
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT LOSING TO A GIRL AGAIN.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.454
WELL, THANKS, 'CAUSE BEING
PITIED IS SO MUCH BETTER.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.081
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CARE ABOUT THIS.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.292
ALL I DID WAS BEAT YOU
AT A FEW LOUSY GAMES.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.544
A FEW? NO, TWO.
TRY TWO LOUSY GAMES,

14:39.753 --> 14:40.795
NOT A FEW. TWO.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.130
AND I DON'T CARE,

14:42.339 --> 14:48.011
SO PLEASE
LEAVE MY PROPERTY.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.804
AS LONG AS
YOU DON'T CARE.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.850
GOD!

14:56.604 --> 14:58.187
HAVE YOU BEEN STANDING
THERE THE WHOLE TIME?

14:58.397 --> 15:01.691
NO. I CAME OUT TO GET ONE
OF YOUR FATHER'S TOOLS.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.986
HE'S IN THERE WORKING
ON MY REFRIGERATOR.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.697
SO I GATHER
YOU AND DONNA

15:07.907 --> 15:09.616
ARE GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.742
NO, MOM.

15:10.951 --> 15:14.120
WE'RE IN A SCHOOL PLAY ABOUT
TWO PEOPLE WHO HATE EACH OTHER.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.664
OH, OK.
OK, MR. SMART-MOUTH,

15:16.874 --> 15:18.625
BUT WHEN YOU GET OLDER,
YOU ARE GOING TO REALIZE

15:18.834 --> 15:20.501
THAT IT'S PRETTY
SILLY TO GET UPSET

15:20.711 --> 15:23.504
ABOUT LOSING A GAME
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.215
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

15:26.425 --> 15:26.966
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:27.176 --> 15:28.801
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS,

15:29.011 --> 15:31.596
BUT I WILL TELL YOU
ONE THING...

15:31.805 --> 15:34.807
YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE PLAYED
MANY, MANY GAMES OVER THE YEARS,

15:35.017 --> 15:37.936
AND WE NEVER KEPT SCORE,
AND WE ALWAYS HAD FUN.

15:38.145 --> 15:39.354
NOW, WHAT DID
I COME OUT HERE FOR?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.105
OH.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.275
YOUR FATHER'S FIXING
MY REFRIGERATOR.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.537
RED, HONEY...

15:56.747 --> 15:58.081
FORGET THE REFRIGERATOR.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.668
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE GARAGE DOOR.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.881
MICHAEL...

16:07.091 --> 16:09.968
WE NEED TO TALK.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.681
AND I AM OVER HERE...

16:16.558 --> 16:19.894
OH, GOD,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

16:20.104 --> 16:22.730
WELL, YOU COULD... AND I KNOW
THIS IS A RADICAL SUGGESTION...

16:22.940 --> 16:25.483
BUT, UM, BE A MAN?

16:27.861 --> 16:29.821
YOU'RE RIGHT, HYDE.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.782
NO MORE EXCUSES.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.202
SHE WILL
CRUSH HIM, YES?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.622
LIKE THE SPIRIT OF
YOUR MAYAN FOREFATHERS.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.917
MY FOREFATHERS
WERE NOT MAYAN.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.836
LIKE ANYONE CARES.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.090
SO, MICHAEL?

16:49.299 --> 16:52.135
SO, JACKIE...

17:00.269 --> 17:01.394
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE YOU HANG UP ON ME.

17:01.603 --> 17:04.147
I'M SORRY.
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

17:04.356 --> 17:04.856
THAT'S OK.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.608
YOU WERE OBVIOUSLY
UNDER A BAD INFLUENCE.

17:10.404 --> 17:11.529
YEAH.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.156
I'M THIRSTY.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.950
MICHAEL,
GET ME A POP.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.749
I'M SORRY.
I REMEMBER SAYING "BE A MAN,"

17:22.958 --> 17:25.543
NOT "BE A WUSS."

17:25.753 --> 17:28.671
I AM ASHAMED
TO KNOW YOU.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.052
UH-HUH.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.847
ALL RIGHT. ALL THOSE WHO
ARE GETTIN' SOME, HANDS UP.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.391
ANYBODY ELSE?

17:40.601 --> 17:41.726
GETTIN' SOME?

17:41.935 --> 17:43.895
HYDE? FEZ?

17:44.104 --> 17:46.522
YEAH.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.873
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.417
OH, JUST...
SHOOTIN' SOME HOOPS,

18:06.627 --> 18:08.961
WAITING FOR AN APOLOGY...

18:09.171 --> 18:11.506
WELL, WHEN YOU THINK OF ONE,
I'LL BE GLAD TO HEAR IT.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.055
OK, LOOK...

18:19.264 --> 18:20.932
WE WERE BOTH
ACTING LIKE JERKS.

18:21.141 --> 18:22.558
I'M SORRY.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.103
YEAH,
I'M SORRY, TOO.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.856
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T
PLAY BASKETBALL ANYMORE.

18:29.066 --> 18:31.734
OR ANY GAMES,
FOR THAT MATTER.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.236
YEAH. MAYBE.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.695
END OF AN ERA, HUH?

18:34.905 --> 18:36.364
HEY, REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE 8

18:36.573 --> 18:38.074
AND I BEAT YOU
AT WRESTLING?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.784
THAT WAS FUN.

18:39.993 --> 18:43.329
DONNA, YOU SAT ON MY CHEST
AND MADE ME EAT A CLUMP OF DIRT.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.998
ALL RIGHT, SCREW IT.
YOU WANT TO JUST PLAY?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.251
YEAH. YEAH, I DO.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.669
HEY, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE ME EAT

18:49.878 --> 18:51.504
A CLUMP OF DIRT AGAIN,
ARE YOU?

18:51.713 --> 18:53.131
WE'LL SEE.

18:56.969 --> 18:57.885
FORMAN HAS THE BALL.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.096
HE FAKES LEFT,
HE BLOWS BY PINCIOTTI...

19:00.305 --> 19:02.223
PINCIOTTI LEAPS
ON HIS BACK...

19:04.852 --> 19:05.726
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:05.936 --> 19:06.644
GIVE ME THE BALL!

19:06.854 --> 19:09.605
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.732
YOU WANT
SOME OF THIS?

19:17.948 --> 19:20.283
OK, FOUL.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.952
SO NOW SUDDENLY WE'RE
CALLING EVERY LITTLE THING?

19:23.162 --> 19:23.619
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:23.829 --> 19:24.996
REACHING FOR
A CLUMP OF DIRT.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.998
NO. DON'T.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.333
I MUST... REACH...
CLUMP OF DIRT.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.003
NOT WHILE I
STILL BREATHE.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.091
WHAT?
NOTHING.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.302
DONNA?

19:39.511 --> 19:39.927
YOU GOTTA GO.

19:40.137 --> 19:40.553
THAT'S MY DAD.

19:40.762 --> 19:41.179
RIGHT.

19:41.388 --> 19:41.888
SEE YA.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.056
BYE.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.558
HEY, WAIT. WHO WON?

19:45.767 --> 19:47.894
I WASN'T
KEEPING SCORE.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.604
COOL. ME, NEITHER.

19:55.152 --> 19:58.321
WELL, THAT WAS
PRETTY SAD, ERIC.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.530
WHAT?

19:59.740 --> 20:00.364
COME ON...

20:00.574 --> 20:02.325
I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
HOW TO PLAY BASKETBALL.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.160
WE GOT 4 HOURS
'TIL YOUR BEDTIME,

20:04.369 --> 20:08.539
AND WE ARE GONNA
DRILL, DRILL, DRILL.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.249
BUT I THOUGHT...

20:10.459 --> 20:12.001
THAT MOM
NEEDED YOUR HELP.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.711
Mrs. Forman: CAN'T HEAR YOU,
ERIC. I'M IRONING.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.297
♪ LA LA-LA-LA... ♪

20:16.506 --> 20:19.050
WE'LL START YOU OFF
WITH 100 SQUAT THRUSTS.

20:19.259 --> 20:20.885
BUT DAD, WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO WON.

20:21.094 --> 20:21.761
SHE DID.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.304
NOW, HIT IT.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.601
1...

20:28.810 --> 20:31.604
2...

20:31.813 --> 20:34.273
3...

20:34.483 --> 20:36.067
4...

20:36.276 --> 20:38.778
98...

20:38.987 --> 20:41.572
99...

20:41.782 --> 20:43.115
100.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.997
OK. LET'S PLAY.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.590
BUT BARBRA STREISAND
BECAME THIS HUGE STAR, RIGHT?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.260
BUT KRIS KRISTOFFERSON
COULD NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE,

21:02.469 --> 21:06.055
SO HE DRINKS AND DRINKS
AND CRASHES HIS CAR.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.932
ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC?

21:08.141 --> 21:11.686
SAY "YES, IT IS."

21:11.895 --> 21:13.187
YES, IT IS.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.399
OH, I JUST LOVE
ROMANTIC MOVIES, DON'T YOU?

21:16.608 --> 21:19.360
"YES, I DO."

21:19.569 --> 21:22.530
YES, I DO.

21:22.739 --> 21:25.533
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD
ROMANTIC SCENE IN A MOVIE?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.076
THAT NIGHT WE HAD
BY THE RESERVOIR

21:27.286 --> 21:29.120
WHEN WE WENT
SKINNY DIPPING.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.331
REMEMBER?

21:32.541 --> 21:36.502
"NO. DESCRIBE IT TO ME."

21:36.712 --> 21:38.337
NO. DESCRIBE IT TO ME.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.673
MICHAEL,
YOU'RE SO BAD.

21:40.882 --> 21:44.677
OK. THE WATER
WAS REALLY COLD,

21:44.886 --> 21:46.554
SO WHEN I DOVE IN...

21:46.763 --> 21:48.139
WELL, YOU KNOW.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.975
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.852
MICHAEL!

21:58.650 --> 21:59.775
UM...

21:59.985 --> 22:00.818
DAD, ABOUT THIS TABLE.

22:01.028 --> 22:01.527
ERIC...

22:01.737 --> 22:02.653
WHAT ABOUT THE TABLE?

22:02.863 --> 22:07.241
JUST THAT IT IS
SO DARN GREAT, RED.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.869
I THINK I OUGHT TO
SHAVE DOWN THE LEGS.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.080
NO. THAT WOULD
JUST RUIN IT, RED.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.083
FOR GOD'S SAKES, I KNOW HOW
TO CUT THE LEGS OFF A TABLE.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.879
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.590
WHAT WAS THAT?

22:22.799 --> 22:24.216
NOTHING, SIR.
