WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:03.303
>> Julie: IT'S BEEN A WILD FEW

00:03.370 --> 00:06.239
DAYS IN "THE BIG BANG THEORY"
HOUSE AND IT'S NOT OVER YET,

00:06.306 --> 00:12.278
TONIGHT THE NEW CELEBRITY WILL
BE WALKING OUT THE DOOR AND IT'S

00:12.345 --> 00:16.449
ALL HAPPENING LIVE ON CELEBRITY
BIG BROTHER.

00:16.516 --> 00:22.155
>> PREVIOUSLY ON CELEBRITY BIG
IMROAR, CHRIS KIRKPATRICK MADE A

00:22.222 --> 00:25.425
FINAL TWO DEAL WITH SHANNA.
>> I WANT TO DO A FINAL TWO.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.961
>> FOR SURE.
>> BUT HE WAS ALSO IN THE

00:28.027 --> 00:33.466
ATHLETE'S ALLIANCE WITH HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD MIESHA, TODRICK, LAMAR

00:33.533 --> 00:37.370
AND MIRAI.
>> NOTE TO SELF, DON'T CROSS

00:37.437 --> 00:40.807
MIESHA TATE.
>> WITH TODD AND CHRIS KATTAN

00:40.874 --> 00:44.644
NOT ALIGNED WITH ANYONE, AND
TEDDI SENT BACK TO BEVERLY

00:44.711 --> 00:47.280
HILLS.
>> Julie: YOU ARE THE FIRST

00:47.347 --> 00:50.550
CELEBRITY EVICTED FROM THE BIG
BROTHER HOUSE.

00:50.617 --> 00:55.555
>> IT APPEARED CLOSE ALLIES
CARSON AND BE CYNTHIA WERE IN

00:55.622 --> 00:57.323
TROUBLE.
>> I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS FOR

00:57.390 --> 01:02.562
CYNTHIA AND I BECAUSE IT SEEMS
LIKE THE REST OF THE HOUSE MIGHT

01:02.629 --> 01:04.764
BE AGAINST US.
>> Announcer: WITH THE HEAD

01:04.831 --> 01:12.639
OF HOUSEHOLD BACK UP FOR GRABS,
THE POP STAR BECAME THE POTATOE

01:12.705 --> 01:16.910
STAR.
>> CHRIS KIRKPATRICK YOU ARE THE

01:16.976 --> 01:20.680
NEW H.O.H.!
>> Announcer: CHRIS WANTED TO

01:20.747 --> 01:23.783
TAKE OUT MIRAI.
>> TO ME, I WANT MIRAI OUT.

01:23.850 --> 01:26.419
>> THE ONLY PERSON I'M NOT TIGHT
WITH IS MIRAI.

01:26.486 --> 01:30.790
AND THE FACT THAT SHE CAN WIN
COMPS, THAT'S DANGEROUS.

01:30.857 --> 01:35.261
>> Announcer: BUT MIESHA
TRIED TO STEER HIM IN A

01:35.328 --> 01:38.431
DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
>> YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT

01:38.498 --> 01:43.536
PUTTING CARSON AND MIRAI.
>> IN MY MIND, THERE'S JUST ONE

01:43.603 --> 01:46.005
TARGET AND THAT'S CARSON.
>> Announcer: WHICH LEFT

01:46.072 --> 01:49.108
KIRKPATRICK CONCERNED.
>> MIESHA STARTS TELLING ME WHAT

01:49.175 --> 01:52.145
SHE WANTS FOR HER GAME.
AND I'M THINKING IN MY HEAD,

01:52.212 --> 01:55.048
THIS IS MY H.O.H.
>> MIESHA THINKS SHE'S RUNNING

01:55.114 --> 01:58.351
THIS HOUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
THE H.O.H.

01:58.418 --> 01:59.519
>> RIGHT.
>> Announcer: WITH NO STRINGS

01:59.586 --> 02:02.589
ATTACHED TO ANY ONE ALLIANCE,
CHRIS BROKERED A DEAL WITH

02:02.655 --> 02:08.194
CARSON AND CYNTHIA.
>> I DON'T THINK ARE YOU REALLY

02:08.261 --> 02:10.296
GUNNING FOR ME, YOU.
>> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING

02:10.363 --> 02:11.464
TO GET WITH US.
>> YEAH.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.967
>> YOU'RE NOT, WITH ANYTHING
THAT I AM THINKING, YOU KNOW,

02:14.033 --> 02:17.237
YOU'RE NOT ON MY RADAR.
>> CHRIS TELLING ME I'M NOT HIS

02:17.303 --> 02:22.141
TARGET IS VERY GOOD NEWS.
CAN I BREATHE A LITTLE SIGH OF

02:22.208 --> 02:24.777
RELIEF.
>> Announcer: AT THE

02:24.844 --> 02:26.880
NOMINATION CEREMONY.
>> I HAVE NOMINATED YOU CHRIS

02:26.946 --> 02:30.250
AND YOU MIRAI.
>> Announcer: KIRKPATRICK PUT

02:30.316 --> 02:34.087
UP A PAWN AND HIS TARGET.
>> I GUESS CHRIS AND I ARE NOT

02:34.153 --> 02:38.525
AS IN SYNC THIS WEEK, BUT
CARSON, DON'T GET TOO

02:38.591 --> 02:40.360
COMFORTABLE.
>> Announcer: TONIGHT THE

02:40.426 --> 02:45.532
VETO COMPETITION PLAYS OUT LIVE.
WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE EITHER

02:45.598 --> 02:52.171
THE SKATER OR THE SNL ALUM?
PLUS ANOTHER FAMOUS FACE WILL BE

02:52.238 --> 02:55.742
EVICTED.
IT ALL HAPPENS RIGHT NOW, LIVE

02:55.808 --> 03:10.690
ON CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING, I'M

03:10.757 --> 03:13.326
ON CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING, I'M

03:13.393 --> 03:16.462
JULIE CHEN MOONVES WELCOME TO
CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.098
13 DAYS IN AND WE HAVE A HOUSE
DIVIDED.

03:19.165 --> 03:23.102
AFTER CHRIS KIRKPATRICK WON HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD IT SEEMS CERTAIN

03:23.169 --> 03:27.173
THAT HIS ALLY MIESHA AND THEIR
ATHLETE'S ALLIANCE WOULD GET

03:27.240 --> 03:30.777
THEIR WAY AND SEND CARSON OUT
THE DOOR.

03:30.843 --> 03:34.781
BUT THE FORMER BOY BAND SINGER
CHARTED HIS OWN COURSE CHOOSING

03:34.847 --> 03:39.619
INSTEAD TO KEEP THE BIGGEST
TARGETS IN THE GAME.

03:39.686 --> 03:43.823
HIS HOPE THAT THEY STAY AND GO
AFTER ONE ANOTHER.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.293
AT THE NOMINATION CEREMONY CHRIS
KATTAN AND MIRAI WERE SURPRISED

03:47.360 --> 03:50.597
TO FIND THEMSELVES ON THE
CHOPPING BLOCK.

03:50.663 --> 03:54.701
BUT TONIGHT THE FORMER SNL STAR
AND THE FORMER OLYMPIAN WILL

03:54.767 --> 03:59.472
HAVE A CHANCE TO SAVE THEMSELVES
IN THE LIVE VETO COMPETITION.

03:59.539 --> 04:03.443
THEN THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION
WILL SEND SOMEONE OUT THE FRONT

04:03.509 --> 04:06.512
DOOR.
BUT FIRST AS CHRIS KIRKPATRICK

04:06.579 --> 04:10.583
CONTINUES TO PLAY BOTH SIDES OF
THE HOUSE, THE OTHER CHRIS IS

04:10.650 --> 04:13.686
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
HOUSE HE'S IN.

04:13.753 --> 04:21.060
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

04:21.127 --> 04:25.765
>> I NOMINATED CHRIS KATTAN AND
MIRAI BUT MY TARGET IS MIRAI.

04:25.832 --> 04:29.102
I'M WORKING WITH MIESHA BUT I'M
WORRIED THAT MIRAI COULD GET IN

04:29.168 --> 04:33.206
HER EAR, THERE WAS A TIME LAST
WEEK WHEN MIRAI WAS OUT THE DOOR

04:33.272 --> 04:36.743
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE'S REALLY TIGHT WITH MIESHA

04:36.809 --> 04:41.948
AND TODRICK.
AND FOR MY GAME THAT MAKES ME

04:42.015 --> 04:48.154
REALLY NERVOUS.
>> I'M ON THE BLOCK AGAIN.

04:48.221 --> 04:53.092
OF COURSE I'M GOING TO KEEP
FIGHTING BECAUSE I AM NOT A

04:53.159 --> 04:56.629
QUITTER.
>> YOU OKAY?

04:56.696 --> 05:01.000
>> YEAH.
>> I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE

05:01.067 --> 05:02.435
FINE.
REALLY, FOR REAL.

05:02.502 --> 05:05.972
>> SO I AM SURPRISED TO SEE MY
FACE UP THERE, I DON'T WANT TO

05:06.039 --> 05:08.107
GO HOME.
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.543
I'M GOING TO TRY MY BEST TO WIN
THE VETO.

05:10.610 --> 05:15.381
OTHER THAN THAT, I'M JUST GOING
TO BE BE ME, ABOVE IT OR LEAVE

05:15.448 --> 05:23.723
IT I HOPE THEY DON'T LEAVE IT.
>> TO PUT IT SIMPLY CHRIS JUST

05:23.790 --> 05:28.428
IS NOT PICKING UP WHAT I'M
PUTTING DOWN.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.830
CARSON WAS THE BIG TARGET THIS
WEEK.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.465
HE IS THE ONE WE SHOULD BE
GUNNING FOR.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.401
BUT THIS ISN'T DEAD YET.
WE STILL HAVE A VETO

05:35.468 --> 05:37.403
COMPETITION.
WE COULD STILL GET CARSON UP

05:37.470 --> 05:39.639
THERE AND GET HIM OUT OF THIS
HOUSE FOR GOOD.

05:39.706 --> 05:42.141
>> YOU ALL RIGHT, CHRIS?
>> HUH?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.043
YEAH.
>> YOU OKAY, YOU SURE?

05:44.110 --> 05:45.945
>> YEAH.
>> OKAY.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.015
>> YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT?
>> YEAH.

05:49.082 --> 05:57.090
>> I KNOW.
>> I JUST THINK YOU'RE

05:57.156 --> 05:58.458
VERY-- AND GOING TO BE JUST
FINE.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.993
>> THANK YOU, CARSON.
>> SO I WOULD NOT STRESS BECAUSE

06:01.060 --> 06:03.463
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
>> I'M NOT STRESSED, IT'S FINE,

06:03.529 --> 06:06.065
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.
NOW THE GAME STARTS.

06:06.132 --> 06:08.835
>> YEAH, IT REALLY DOES.
BUT I FIRMLY.

06:08.901 --> 06:11.604
>> WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO GO
ANYWAYS.

06:11.671 --> 06:13.372
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> FROM WHAT I GATHER FROM

06:13.439 --> 06:15.675
EVERYBODY, I DON'T THINK I HAVE
DONE ANYTHING.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.678
>> NO.
>> I HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH GAME.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.713
>> RIGHT.
>> I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.149
>> YEAH NO, THAT'S FINE.
>> THAT IS WHAT I MEAN.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.219
>> YOU ARE UNDER THE RADAR.
>> I'M NOT HERE TO STRATEGIZE

06:26.285 --> 06:29.122
AND MAKE ALLIANCES.
BUT THAT BEING A REASON IS

06:29.188 --> 06:31.791
WIRD.
>> I'M SAD TO SEE CHRIS KATTAN

06:31.858 --> 06:34.961
UP THERE ON THE NOMINATION WALL
BUT I'M GLAD IT'S NOT ME, OKAY.

06:35.027 --> 06:39.599
THIS WEEK I'M JUST GOING TO LAY
LOW, BLEND IN, NOT MAKE EYE

06:39.665 --> 06:41.701
CONTACT.
BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO HIDE

06:41.768 --> 06:45.571
ALL THIS FABULOUSNESS.
>> YOU CAN ALWAYS WIN THE VETO

06:45.638 --> 06:48.174
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, I DID.
SO ANYONE CAN.

06:48.241 --> 06:57.150
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
>> OH MY GOD.

06:57.216 --> 07:00.787
>> I FEEL BAD BUT WHAT ARE MY
OPTIONS.

07:00.853 --> 07:03.289
>> YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
YEAH.

07:03.356 --> 07:08.194
>> I'M SO RELIEVED NOT TO SEE MY
FACE, OKAY, OR CARSON'S FACE ON

07:08.261 --> 07:13.032
THAT NOMINATION BOARD THIS WEEK.
BUT THERE COULD BE A REPLACEMENT

07:13.099 --> 07:16.836
NOMINEE AND I WOULD NOT BE
SHOCKED IF I ENDED UP ON THE

07:16.903 --> 07:19.438
BLOCK.
>> I MEAN HONESTLY I DON'T EVEN

07:19.505 --> 07:24.911
KNOW WHAT THEY GOING TO DO.
>> TODRICK IS STILL ALIGNED WITH

07:24.977 --> 07:25.845
HER.
>> I KNOW.

07:25.912 --> 07:29.549
>> AND SHE HAS MIRAI, HER
MINION.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.518
>> SHANNA IS MY ONE.
AND HER AND I ARE TRYING TO WALK

07:32.585 --> 07:36.055
THIS TIGHT ROPE EVEN THOUGH WE
ARE ALIGNED WITH MIESHA AND

07:36.122 --> 07:39.959
TODRICK, IT BENEFITS US IF WE
STILL HAVE CARSON AND MISS

07:40.026 --> 07:42.895
CYNTHIA IN THE HOUSE TO KEEP THE
TARGETS OFF OF ME AND SHANNA.

07:42.962 --> 07:46.999
SO I NEED TO WIN THIS VETO AND
KEEP NOMS THE SAME SO I CAN KEEP

07:47.066 --> 07:50.069
BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE HAPPY.
>> THEN MIESHA WON'TLET IT GO,

07:50.136 --> 07:54.040
SHE WANTED ONE OF US.
>> SHE WANTED MIRAI TO STAY, I'M

07:54.106 --> 07:55.441
THINKING, BECAUSE SHE CAN
CONTROL HER.

07:55.508 --> 08:00.313
>> BUT IF MIRAI STAYS, MIRAI
WILL DO THAT-- THAT WHOLE TIME.

08:00.379 --> 08:03.349
AND WE NEED TO SLOWLY START
BREAKING THAT UP.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.217
>> RIGHT.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

08:04.283 --> 08:06.752
>> IF NOT THEY WILL JUST PICK US
ALL OFF.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.956
>> IF MIRAI TAKES HERSELF OFF
THE BLOCK OR MIESHA WINS AND

08:10.022 --> 08:12.892
TAKES HER OFF THE BLOCK.
>> IF MIESHA TAKES HER OFF THE

08:12.959 --> 08:25.504
BLOCK THERE'S GOING TO BE HELL
TO PAY.

08:25.571 --> 08:29.508
>> HI BABE, HOW ARE YOU DOING?
>> OKAY.

08:29.575 --> 08:33.713
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
I AM VERY LOYALTY TO YOU AND

08:33.779 --> 08:38.618
MIESHA AND LIKE I WANT TO BE
HERE TO PROTECT YOU GUYS.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.953
>> YEAH, I WILL ADVOCATE FOR YOU
IN THE HOUSE.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.756
>> THANK YOU.
>> I'M TRYING MY HORDES TO

08:43.823 --> 08:46.626
ENCOURAGE MIRAI BECAUSE IF SHE
CAN WIN THIS VETO SHE COULD

08:46.692 --> 08:49.028
STILL BE HERE FOR A FEW MORE
WEEKS.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.730
I TRUST HER.
I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH

08:50.796 --> 08:53.933
HER AND I THINK SHE IS A BIGGER
TARGET IN THE HOUSE THAN I AM.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.837
I NEED HER TO REALLY STEP IT UP.
>> I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I

08:57.904 --> 08:59.839
WILL DO ANYTHING TO KEEP YOU IN
THE HOUSE.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.941
I THINK YOU ARE A REALLY SPECIAL
PERSON.

09:02.008 --> 09:05.278
>> THANK YOU.
>> AND IF IT IS MEANT FOR YOU TO

09:05.344 --> 09:20.226
BE HERE, YOU WILL WIN THAT VETO.
>> I HOPE SO.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.394
BE HERE, YOU WILL WIN THAT VETO.
>> I HOPE SO.

09:21.460 --> 09:30.102
>> WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT IN THE
BIG BROTHER HOUSE, IT IS

09:30.169 --> 09:44.483
ABSOLUTELY PITCH DARK.
IT IT IS SO DARK AND SO

09:44.550 --> 09:50.356
TREACHEROUS YOU CAN BUMP INTO A
REALITY STAR OR TRIP OVER A

09:50.423 --> 09:59.565
BEAUTY QUEEN.
>> RUN INTO LITTLE OLD ME.

09:59.632 --> 10:04.370
AND I WAS FLATTERED.
IT IS VERY LONELY IN THIS HOUSE

10:04.437 --> 10:06.205
BUT I WAS LIKE, KEEP IT IT
MOVING.

10:06.272 --> 10:21.153
TRYING TO GET MY BEAUTY REST.
>> WHAT IS THIS?

10:21.220 --> 10:25.825
TRYING TO GET MY BEAUTY REST.
>> WHAT IS THIS?

10:25.891 --> 10:28.661
>> I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S GO.

10:28.728 --> 10:31.063
>> OKAY, YOU READY?
>> YEAH.

10:31.130 --> 10:38.571
>> I KNOW H.O.H. IS STRESSFUL
BUT SINCE CHRIS AND I ARE SO

10:38.637 --> 10:44.243
NSYNC, I FIGURED WE WOULD DO
SOME SPOT MASKS.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.846
>> MIESHA FEELS LIKE SHE'S
RUNNING THE HOUSE.

10:46.912 --> 10:52.618
>> SHE'S GOT TODRICK AND MIRAI
AT HER BECK AND CALL.

10:52.685 --> 10:55.321
SHE IN HER HEAD IS RUNNING THIS
WITHIN RIGHT.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.991
AND WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GET ONE
OF THEM OUT.

10:59.058 --> 11:03.429
IF MIRAI IS GONE, THAT'S
BEAUTIFUL FOR OUR GAME WITHIN

11:03.496 --> 11:08.868
I'M TRYING TO GET MIRAI OUT NOW
BECAUSE IF I DON'T, THE NUMBERS

11:08.934 --> 11:11.670
ON MIESHA'S SIDE ARE GOING TO
GROW.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.939
HER CIRCLE WILL BE WHOEVER SHE
WANTS IT TO BE.

11:14.006 --> 11:18.277
AND IF I'M NOT IN THAT CIRCLE,
IF SHANNA IS NOT IN THAT CIRCLE,

11:18.344 --> 11:22.314
WE'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
>> IF MIESHA WINS THE VETO I

11:22.381 --> 11:25.284
NEED TO GO IT TO HER AND SAY YOU
GOT TO HELP ME ONE WEEK, YOU

11:25.351 --> 11:28.721
KNOW, WITH MIRAI.
>> THIS VETO COMPETITION IS

11:28.788 --> 11:31.757
GOING TO DEFINE A LOT.
>> BEST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT I

11:31.824 --> 11:36.062
WIN THE VETO.
>> YEAH.

11:36.128 --> 11:38.964
>> Julie: UP NEXT, WITH THE
LIVE VETO IN PLAY TONIGHT, COULD

11:39.031 --> 11:43.035
MIESHA PULL SOME STRINGS AND
STILL GET HER WISH TO GET CARSON

11:43.102 --> 11:48.340
OUT OF THE HOUSE?
THEN THE LIVE VETO COMPETITION

11:48.407 --> 11:50.309
COULD CHANGE.
EITHER CHRIS KATTAN OR MIRAI'S

11:50.376 --> 11:52.578
FATE.
STAY WITH US.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.495
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO STEL
EBB RIT BIG BROTHER.

12:09.562 --> 12:13.599
AS THE VETO COMPETITION DRAWS
NEAR CRACKS IN THE ATHLETE'S

12:13.666 --> 12:22.441
ALLIANCE ARE ARE STARTING TO
WIDEN AND NEW TARGETS EMERGE.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.877
>> YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SO GOOD
TO ME.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.245
>> YOU?
>> I THINK I NEED TO CRASH.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.613
>> WHAT HAPPENED.
>> I DREAMT MY SON LAST NIGHT.

12:27.680 --> 12:32.785
>> THE ONE THAT PASSED AWAY.
>> YOU DREAMTED.

12:32.852 --> 12:36.589
>> HE WAS TALKING.
>> MY SON PASSED AWAY FROM SIDES

12:36.655 --> 12:40.025
OF SIX MONTHS OLD, EVEN AT SIX
MONTHS OLD I WOULD SAY WE HAD A

12:40.092 --> 12:45.598
REALLY GREAT RELATIONSHIP.
BECAUSE WHENEVER I WOULD COME

12:45.664 --> 12:51.237
INTO THE ROOM, HIS EYES WOULD
JUST FOLLOW ME.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.239
WHEREVER I WENT UNTIL I PICKED
HIM UP.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.708
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS FROM
THOUGH.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.510
>> WHAT.
>> I DIDN'T GRIEVE PROPERLY, I

12:57.576 --> 12:59.311
DON'T THINK WHEN MY SON PASSED
AWAY.

12:59.378 --> 13:02.181
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
FROM.

13:02.248 --> 13:05.017
>> HEARING LAMAR THAT HE LOST A
KID HAS TO BE THE BIGGEST THING

13:05.084 --> 13:08.521
THAT SOMEONE HAS TO DEAL WITH.
AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO LAMAR

13:08.587 --> 13:10.823
BECAUSE HE HAS DEALT WITH SO
MUCH STUFF, THE PEOPLE ON THE

13:10.890 --> 13:14.326
OUTSIDE DON'T SEE THAT.
BUT THOSE OF US WHO ARE GETTING

13:14.393 --> 13:17.630
TO KNOW HIM ON THE INSIDE, WE
HEAR ABOUT IT AND WE CAN SEE

13:17.696 --> 13:25.137
THAT HE IS GOING THROUGH A LOT.
>> HE KEPT SAYING CAMP THE

13:25.204 --> 13:26.305
RAINBOW, DADDY.
>> REALLY.

13:26.372 --> 13:30.376
>> WHEN HE PASSED AWAY HE
COULDN'T TALK, HE WAS A REALLY

13:30.442 --> 13:34.380
SPECIAL BABY.
2006 WOULD HAVE MADE HIM RIGHT

13:34.446 --> 13:38.417
NOW I THINK 15 OR 14 YEARS OLD.
>> IT IS SOMETHING I DON'T THINK

13:38.484 --> 13:41.654
I WILL EVER GET OVER.
FOR HIM COMING TO ME IN A DREAM

13:41.720 --> 13:44.957
LETS ME KNOW THAT HE IS NOT TOO
FAR AWAY.

13:45.024 --> 13:49.328
AND YOU KNOW, I KNOW I WILL SEE
HIM IN THE AFTERLIFE.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.997
>> WHAT WAS HIS NAME.
>> JADEN.

13:52.064 --> 13:56.535
>> JADEN, THAT IS PRETTY.
>> JADEN ODOM.

13:56.602 --> 14:06.278
>> SNATCH THE RAINBOW, DADDY.
>> WHAT ARE WE THINKING HERE.

14:06.345 --> 14:10.516
>> TO US RIGHT NOW I TRUST HER,
I CONSIDER HER AN ASSET.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.085
>> I DON'T TRUST HER LIKE YOU
GUYS TRUST HER.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.788
I DON'T KNOW HER.
>> I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK THIS

14:15.854 --> 14:19.825
LAST WEEK TO SAVE MIRAI AND I
WAS REALLY HOPING TO CASH IN ON

14:19.892 --> 14:24.163
THE FAVOR THAT SHE OWES ME.
I AM ROOTING FOR HER TO PULL

14:24.230 --> 14:28.234
HERSELF OFF THE BLOCK SO WE CAN
CONTINUE WITH OUR GAME PLAN OF

14:28.300 --> 14:30.669
GETTING CARSON OUT OF THIS
HOUSE.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.305
>> YOU'RE GETTING RID OF SOMEONE
OFF THE TEAM.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.708
>> NOT MY TEAM, REMEMBER, SHE IS
YOUR TEAM MEMBER.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.377
>> SHE IS NOT MY TEAM MEMBER,
SHE HASN'T SAID.

14:38.444 --> 14:43.482
>> SHE WOULD TARGET CARSON.
>> CARSON HAS PROVEEN.

14:43.549 --> 14:48.454
>> YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE
PERSON WHO REALLY HAS ONE GOOD

14:48.520 --> 14:49.622
COMP.
>> I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.491
I KNOW WHEN I'M BEING
MANIPULATED.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.959
YOU'RE TRYING TO PITCH YOUR GAME
ON ME.

14:54.026 --> 14:57.363
WHY WOULD I PLAY MY GAME ON YOUR
H.O.H.

14:57.429 --> 15:00.666
>> THE ODDS OF CARSON WINNING
SOMETHING IS PUTTING-- ARE MUCH

15:00.733 --> 15:05.104
HIGHER THAN THEY ARE OF MIRAI
WINNING SOMETHING AND PUTTING

15:05.170 --> 15:06.972
YOU OUT.
YOU WOULD NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN.

15:07.039 --> 15:09.141
I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING LIKE EIGHT
MOVES AHEAD.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.144
>> THIS IS LIKE PLAYING CHESS
TRK IS GOOD TO IRON OUT ALL THE

15:12.211 --> 15:14.380
DETAILS.
>> I FEEL LIKE CHRISIS GETTING

15:14.446 --> 15:17.950
A LITTLE BIT TEMPERMENTAL ABOUT
THIS DISCUSSION AND I FEEL LIKE

15:18.017 --> 15:21.687
MIESHA AND I ARE JUST TRYING TO
OFFER HIM ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.257
AND MIRAI STILL BEING IN THE
HOUSE IS DEFINITELY NOT BAD FOR

15:25.324 --> 15:27.626
TODRICK'S GAME.
SORRY CHRIS.

15:27.693 --> 15:30.362
>> CARSON I GUARANTEE IS MY
BIGGEST THREAT.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.099
>> LAST WEEK WAS FOR YOU GUYS.
AND YOUR GAME, RIGHT.

15:34.166 --> 15:49.048
THIS WEEK IS FOR ME AND MY GAME.
>> WHAT IS THEIR PITCH TO YOU?

15:49.114 --> 15:53.519
THIS WEEK IS FOR ME AND MY GAME.
>> WHAT IS THEIR PITCH TO YOU?

15:53.585 --> 15:56.422
>> THEY SHE IS ONE OF THE
ALLIANCE, SHE'S NOT GUNNING FOR

15:56.488 --> 15:57.589
ME, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY

16:01.627 --> 16:05.497

WE DO OURS THIS WEEK.

16:05.564 --> 16:10.269
>> AND MIRAI IF SHE
GETS-- CHOICE SHE WILL PICK ONE

16:10.336 --> 16:12.271
OF THEM.
>> WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

16:12.338 --> 16:17.009
THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT.
>> WE CAN'T BACK DOOR THEM, MY

16:17.076 --> 16:21.113
ONLY OTHER OPTION IS LAMAR.
>> YEAH.

16:21.180 --> 16:28.253
>> OR TODD AS A PAWN.
>> I MEAN IF YOU NEED-- A-- PUT

16:28.320 --> 16:29.988
TODRICK UP.
>> I CAME HERE TO PLAY, AND

16:30.055 --> 16:33.559
MIRAI IS MY TARGET.
BUT IF SHE COMES DOWN, I'M GOING

16:33.625 --> 16:44.303
TO CONSIDER ALL OF MY OPTIONS
FOR A REPLACEMENT.

16:44.370 --> 16:48.807

A VETO EVERY ONE WANTS TO WIN.

16:48.874 --> 16:52.277
