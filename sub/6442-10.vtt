00:12.179 --> 00:14.909
Looking for something special?

00:17.885 --> 00:22.185
My mom's birthday's coming up.
How are you feeling?

00:22.623 --> 00:26.389
Still trying to get the taste
of hospital Jell-O out of my mouth.

00:29.496 --> 00:31.225
But the leg's feeling better.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.662
I thought of visiting, but....

00:36.069 --> 00:38.060
It's okay. I understand.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.309
I've gotta go. Bye.

01:07.534 --> 01:08.762
Sure about this?

01:08.936 --> 01:11.496
Follow the plan, Nathan.
Nobody will know you're there.

01:13.273 --> 01:17.437
You smash, I grab. It's done.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.271
Do your thing, kid.

01:27.955 --> 01:31.618
Last time Martha was in,
she made a point of trying these on.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.958
Did she try anything on
that didn't have four numbers in the price?

01:36.497 --> 01:40.297
Well, I just got in some nice
costume pieces from a local designer.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.560
Quite unique.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.434
Straight from outer space.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.704
Thanks, but I'll keep looking.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.067
Not another step.

02:30.083 --> 02:34.213
Don't you move.
The police are on their way.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.783
-Clark, are you all right?
-Lana?

02:40.961 --> 02:43.122
Lana, it's my eyes. I can't see.

03:43.423 --> 03:46.654
Here, honey. Sit back, there you go.

03:51.198 --> 03:54.656
Jonathan, we have to do something.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.099
Yeah, I know, sweetheart, but what?

03:57.971 --> 04:00.804
Clark's retinas were scarred
by that heat burst.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.566
You saw the doctor, he was baffled.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.938
He wasn't baffled. You handcuffed him.

04:05.112 --> 04:08.138
The last doctor we trusted
sold Clark's blood to Lionel Luthor.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.647
-We'll find one we can trust.
-We can't risk that.

04:10.817 --> 04:14.583
Clark has lost his sight. We may have
to risk someone learning his secret.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.719
Martha, this is not about Clark's secret.
His powers have hurt him.

04:18.892 --> 04:23.158
And before we run out and just
do something, we should think this through.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.724
Don't I get a vote?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.136
Of course you do, Clark.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.875
I think it may just be a question of time
before I get better.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.768
Sweetheart, it could be permanent.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.474
And there's a lot of people who learn
to live with disabilities every day.

04:45.352 --> 04:49.015
What's the worst that could happen?
Go to school and walk through a wall?

04:57.798 --> 05:00.232
Everyone's staring, aren't they?

05:01.034 --> 05:04.492
-They're just digging your shades.
-Yeah.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.199
Hey, man, let me give you a hand.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.003
I've been up on this combination
since third grade.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.542
Here you go.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.450
If it helps, the guy who did this
landed on my mom's court calendar.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.389
I don't think Judge Ross will be giving
this Masterson guy any breaks.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.224
Clark.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.528
-You're already back.
-It's nothing quite that heroic.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.534
It's just a pit stop.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.265
Well, if you need anything,
I'm here for you.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.138
Class notes, help writing papers....

05:53.754 --> 05:56.018
One thing I learned from my accident...

05:56.189 --> 05:59.090
...is that you can't go through
something like this alone.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.828
Just because I'm blind, doesn't mean
the issues between us disappeared.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.591
This doesn't change anything.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.797
I was just offering
a helping hand, Clark...

06:09.970 --> 06:12.063
...but I won't make that mistake again.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.802
Whoever said "absence makes
the heart grow fonder"...

06:18.979 --> 06:22.312
...obviously hasn't met the two of you.
Here you go.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.474
-What's the matter?
-Pete, did you hear that?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.739
-Hear what?
-Hello.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.110
-Chloe?
-She's not here, Clark.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.081
-Hello?
-Pete, I can hear her right now.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.719
What do you want?

07:00.887 --> 07:03.754
I'm at school.
This isn 't the best place to talk.

07:03.924 --> 07:07.690
I'm done with this.
Someone could hear me.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.728
I can't believe you're calling me
after all that's happened.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.663
Look, I told you before...

07:12.833 --> 07:14.858
...my researching Clark days are over.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.198
Really? I have such a vivid memory
of that young reporter...

07:18.371 --> 07:21.568
...just eager to work
for the Daily Planet.

07:21.741 --> 07:24.835
As an opportunity I provided for
with only one requirement.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.910
Well, I gave you all the information I had,
Mr. Luthor.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.677
Look, you have to look at Clark Kent
as a work in progress.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.188
Tell me it didn't arouse
your instincts as a journalist...

07:36.356 --> 07:38.756
...when you learned about
Clark's blindness.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.491
Especially when the others at the scene
had hearing-related traumas.

07:43.063 --> 07:47.500
Find someone else to connect the dots,
Mr. Luthor, because I'm done with this.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.931
What are you gonna do, then?
You gonna go running back to Lex?

07:51.104 --> 07:55.165
-Or what's left of him?
-Lex has a serious mental illness.

07:55.342 --> 07:59.836
It's as if there's a--
A crack in his foundation, you understand?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.410
The structure may look perfectly stable...

08:02.582 --> 08:04.447
...but it can't take any pressure.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.086
So we will let Lex sit in his office...

08:07.354 --> 08:08.878
...sharpening pencils.

08:09.256 --> 08:13.590
But I expect a full report from you
on Clark Kent, Miss Sullivan, by--

08:17.697 --> 08:19.028
Clark, what happened?

08:20.700 --> 08:23.897
Pete, there's something wrong.
You have to get me home right away.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.381
So these sounds, they--
They just hit you all at once?

08:37.549 --> 08:40.110
Like someone turned on
a giant stereo full-blast.

08:40.287 --> 08:43.688
-Suddenly all the sounds were magnified.
-Here's the couch.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.088
And then they just went away.
It was completely random.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.361
Well, with your x-ray abilities
and your heat vision...

08:50.530 --> 08:53.090
...I'm not really sure how
your senses should develop.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.756
It may be just a one-time thing.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.495
Or your body trying to compensate
for its lack of sight.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.462
I just hope it goes away.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.468
All the sounds, they were so loud.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.510
I didn't know where they were
coming from or what they were.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.642
Then there was Chloe and Lionel.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.617
What about them?

09:15.855 --> 09:18.323
They were on the phone.
They were talking about me.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.686
I don't think it was
for the first time, either.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.760
Hey.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.262
-Lex, it's nice to see you.
-How are you? Mr. Kent.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.163
I have to fill out paperwork
for Clark's principal.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.530
Yeah, that stuff's due tomorrow.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.809
Clark, I don't know what to say.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.515
How about hello?

09:43.683 --> 09:46.550
Come on. Behind the Ray-Bans,
I'm still the same old Clark.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.952
You know, when my father
lost his sight...

09:50.123 --> 09:53.115
...I contacted some of the world's
top ophthalmologists.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.784
You just say the word,
I'll get any of them for you.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.897
I appreciate that, Lex,
but this isn't a problem to be solved.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.056
It's something I need to
learn to live with.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.026
Look, I really don't wanna talk about it.

10:04.204 --> 10:08.072
Even when people don't mention it,
I can hear the concern in their voices.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.601
Trust me...

10:11.277 --> 10:13.211
...I know the feeling.

10:13.780 --> 10:18.479
I found there's an almost medieval prejudice
against the survivors of mental illness.

10:19.886 --> 10:25.153
The only way I can put the insinuations
behind me is by proving my worth.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.484
How are you gonna do that?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.619
By returning to LuthorCorp.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.691
My father's offered me
my old position back.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.366
Lex, do you think that job offer
is for real?

10:37.537 --> 10:39.004
Why, Clark?

10:39.672 --> 10:41.503
You know something I don't?

10:42.842 --> 10:47.176
I heard that that job offer's a sham.
Your dad doesn't really think you're better.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.784
So he thinks I'm just gonna sit in my office
and twiddle my thumbs?

10:54.954 --> 10:57.787
No, his exact words were
"sharpening pencils."

11:00.093 --> 11:02.027
Clark, where did you hear this?

11:03.696 --> 11:05.391
It doesn't matter where I heard it.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.534
The important thing is,
you need to be careful.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.567
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi.

11:20.146 --> 11:23.377
You know, Jonathan, I was thinking,
maybe we should hire extra hands.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.848
You look tired.
I'm concerned about you.

11:27.053 --> 11:31.387
No, Martha,
we're barely making ends meet as it is.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.885
It won't help if you wind up
in a hospital bed.

11:34.060 --> 11:37.757
I'll be all right, I just need....
Need to catch my breath.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.959
What are you doing?

11:40.133 --> 11:44.502
Board of education disability application
to get Clark a special teacher.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.668
His counselor said that
he could take his regular classes.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.241
Until when?

11:51.010 --> 11:52.568
His life has changed...

11:53.480 --> 11:56.142
...and so has yours,
but neither one of you will admit it.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.682
-Martha--
-You both think you're supermen...

11:58.852 --> 12:02.686
...who can do everything alone,
but you can't anymore.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.890
You need to start relying on people,
and so does he.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.406
So I got a letter
from the insurance carrier.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.709
Apparently, my entire medical bill
has been taken care of?

12:35.421 --> 12:38.549
Well, who said all insurance companies
are evil?

12:40.393 --> 12:42.486
It wasn't your fault, Lana.
It was mine.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.460
I pushed you into the stall.
That spooked the horse.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.463
-Lex, you were--
-Crazy?

12:48.968 --> 12:50.230
Not yourself.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.931
Semantics aside, you got caught
in the crossfire trying to help me.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.474
For that, I'm truly sorry.

12:57.810 --> 13:02.474
As much as I appreciate
the grand gestures...

13:02.649 --> 13:06.449
...you could've just stopped by the Talon
and said hello.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.411
Yeah, well, the grand gestures
have always come easier.

13:12.659 --> 13:15.822
I'm sorry I couldn't be there
during your rehabilitation...

13:15.995 --> 13:19.294
...but I'm sure Clark was more than able
to pick up the slack.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.591
Actually, Clark hasn't been around.

13:23.369 --> 13:26.270
We kind of decided the best way
to stop hurting each other...

13:26.439 --> 13:28.703
...was to stop seeing
each other altogether.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.803
Given his new reality, I'm sure
he could use your support right now.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.714
The brave front's an act, Lana.
My father did the same thing.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.718
Lex, I've tried to reach out to him.

13:42.121 --> 13:46.285
I don't think my presence
is going to raise his spirits.

13:49.696 --> 13:52.130
By the way, who's Adam?

13:56.002 --> 13:59.096
I noticed the Talon bills included some...

13:59.272 --> 14:02.070
...gift baskets sent to him
at the Smallville Medical Center.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.142
I'm going to reimburse the shop.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.608
You still haven't answered my question.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.642
He's a friend I made in physical therapy.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.253
Must've made quite an impression.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.514
Yeah, he did.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.158
Don't be a stranger.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.683
Clark?

14:48.254 --> 14:50.779
-Chloe.
-Hi.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.455
Look, as much as I try and avoid
unbearable cliches...

14:55.628 --> 14:58.529
...if there's anything I can do, just....

14:58.698 --> 15:00.256
I'll manage.

15:01.367 --> 15:05.098
You didn't come all the way out here
to check out the blind guy.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.705
Actually, I'm on something of a mission.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.739
Have you seen Pete?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.338
Sorry.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.641
It's....

15:14.414 --> 15:18.043
We were supposed to meet this morning
and double-team my Daily Planet column--

15:18.217 --> 15:21.482
Is that the column
Lionel Luthor helped you land?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.185
What's that supposed to mean?

15:28.294 --> 15:33.061
I may have lost my sight,
but things are becoming much clearer now.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.131
Exactly how long have you and Lionel
been looking into my life?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.400
Since last spring.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.810
The day after Lex's wedding.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.151
When you saw me and Lana together.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.520
Is that why you did this?

16:00.426 --> 16:02.826
Your silence is deafening.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.924
-What did you give him?
-Nothing.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.159
-Nothing he didn't already know.
-Then what is he sharing with you?

16:09.335 --> 16:10.859
Nothing.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.767
Believe it or not, Clark,
I was trying to help you.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.498
-By spying on me?
-No...

16:15.675 --> 16:19.873
...by trying to understand
why he's so intrigued with you.

16:20.046 --> 16:24.608
And if the Torch got new computers, or you
made a name for yourself, that's okay too.

16:25.451 --> 16:28.909
After accusing me of keeping secrets,
how could you do this to me?

16:29.422 --> 16:31.151
I was....

16:31.991 --> 16:34.926
He just-- He caught me
at an especially bad time...

16:35.328 --> 16:36.920
...and I caved.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.788
I'm trying to get out of it, but when
people like Lionel Luthor have you...

16:40.967 --> 16:42.730
...they don't want to let go.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.265
I thought that you, out of all people...

16:48.441 --> 16:52.377
...would understand making a stupid
decision in a moment of weakness.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.412
But I guess I was wrong.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.992
Clark!

17:18.704 --> 17:22.140
Your parents are ready to start
gluing your picture to milk cartons.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.002
How'd you get out here, anyhow?

17:24.176 --> 17:25.439
I walked.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.670
Turns out I do know
every inch of this farm.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.778
I really didn't mean to scare them.
I couldn't take all the noise.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.419
So your mega-hearing is back?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.583
Suddenly, I'm the ultimate eavesdropper.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.427
Did someone follow you?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.064
No. Why?

17:48.267 --> 17:49.734
Clark.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.532
Ross! Get in the truck!

17:55.241 --> 17:57.334
Pete, what's going on?

18:10.122 --> 18:12.886
-Pete?
-I said, get in the truck!

18:14.327 --> 18:16.227
Pete, who is that?

18:19.499 --> 18:21.899
Pete, what's going on? Talk to me.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.065
Pete!

18:33.746 --> 18:37.182
-So they didn't find anything by Pete's car?
-Nothing helpful.

18:37.350 --> 18:41.081
Whoever took Pete made the same sound
Clark heard at the jewelry store.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.778
There has to be a connection.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.513
I understand that, Mrs. Kent...

18:44.690 --> 18:48.683
...but frankly, your son's
ear-witness testimony isn't much help.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.954
No, it is too a help, sheriff.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.291
It means that Masterson
has an accomplice.

18:53.466 --> 18:57.197
And in a town of 45,000 people,
that doesn't exactly narrow things down.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.134
No, but I'd think it'd give you
a place to start. Abby?

19:00.740 --> 19:04.540
Judge Ross? You should be home
in case there's a ransom demand.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.869
They just called.
I asked your deputy to bring me here.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.514
Is Pete all right?

19:09.682 --> 19:11.616
So far.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.752
Abby....

19:16.989 --> 19:20.686
-What do they want?
-Masterson's pretrial hearing is tomorrow.

19:21.360 --> 19:26.354
Apparently, his attorney is going to make
a motion to dismiss all charges.

19:27.033 --> 19:31.766
If I don't grant it,
they're gonna kill my son.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.937
Oh, my gosh. Abby....

20:00.766 --> 20:03.428
Clark, you mind telling us
what's going on in here?

20:03.603 --> 20:07.198
-I'm trying to focus my hearing!
-I take it you're not having much luck!

20:07.506 --> 20:09.838
If I don't get a handle on this,
I can't save Pete.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.644
Clark, Judge Ross was at the house.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.454
I know. Dad, I heard.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.949
Playing chicken with the kidnappers
is not a good idea.

20:26.325 --> 20:30.318
They're gonna kill Pete.
I've gotta focus. Help me.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.225
All right, let's get to work, then.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.814
Listen for your father's voice.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.770
All right, Clark, concentrate.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.279
Concentrate on my voice, son.

21:23.249 --> 21:24.807
Dad!

21:30.823 --> 21:32.882
Clark. Clark!

21:33.426 --> 21:36.293
Dad, it's okay. It's okay.
For a second, I could hear you.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.390
That's great. I was barely whispering.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.864
Okay. Let's keep working.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.409
Focus, Clark.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.407
Focus on my voice.

21:54.213 --> 21:56.113
Can you hear me?

21:59.919 --> 22:01.511
Good.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.385
Lex?

22:10.563 --> 22:13.259
I'm sorry, son.
I'm afraid I don't have much time.

22:13.432 --> 22:16.993
I have to be back in Metropolis in an hour.
What did you want to talk about?

22:17.169 --> 22:22.038
When I was released from the institution,
you welcomed me back with open arms.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.199
That's right.

22:24.376 --> 22:28.676
I should've known better than to
take your promises at face value.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.580
I don't understand, son.
What are we talking about?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.810
Humiliation.

22:35.721 --> 22:40.055
Word's out that my position at LuthorCorp
will consist of a title and little else.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.524
That's foolish, son.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.562
I've always wanted you to work with me.
You know that.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.389
To do what? Sharpen pencils?

22:55.307 --> 22:58.902
Lex, please. Listen to me.

22:59.078 --> 23:02.639
If you thought you could throw me
behind a desk and forget about me...

23:02.815 --> 23:04.976
...you're making a grave mistake.

23:05.284 --> 23:08.481
Unless, of course, my source is wrong.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.948
It's true, Lex.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.286
I have been disappointed
with your performance in the past...

23:14.460 --> 23:16.360
...but it's nothing
I haven't said to you.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.895
And, evidently, to anyone who will listen.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.557
So I have to keep proving myself,
is that it?

23:23.235 --> 23:27.399
Unfortunately, we have to
prove ourselves every day.

23:27.573 --> 23:29.473
I've come to accept that...

23:29.642 --> 23:32.236
...and in time, so will you...

23:32.411 --> 23:33.969
...I hope.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.910
Lex, listen to me.

23:37.383 --> 23:42.150
If someone is trying
to drive a wedge between us...

23:42.321 --> 23:44.846
...someone we both know...

23:45.191 --> 23:47.955
...then that's treachery, son.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.159
Who is this source of yours?

23:53.032 --> 23:57.128
Who were you talking to when
you decided to trash me behind my back?

24:04.210 --> 24:07.668
Dad, I'm really worried about Pete.
We've looked everywhere.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.849
Well, we're at the Talon, Clark.

24:13.018 --> 24:16.044
I thought maybe you and l
could get an update.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.887
I'll be right back, son.

24:21.093 --> 24:24.221
-That was fast.
-Your dad told me you were out here.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.932
Lana.

24:27.333 --> 24:30.393
I thought you might want some company.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.802
-But if you don't....
-No, please stay.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.205
About this morning....

24:39.378 --> 24:41.903
It's okay, Clark. You were upset.

24:42.348 --> 24:45.681
No. It's not okay.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.820
All I've managed to do lately
is push people away...

24:48.988 --> 24:52.754
...and the truth is, Lana,
I miss having you in my life.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.853
But I understand why
you don't want me around.

24:59.798 --> 25:02.460
I was hurt and scared.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.626
Clark, I overreacted.

25:05.671 --> 25:09.004
The way I've been treating you,
I'm surprised you didn't bolt sooner.

25:10.242 --> 25:13.439
I know you had your reasons
for pulling away.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.748
Maybe those reasons are gone.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.445
What are you saying?

25:24.623 --> 25:27.615
What I'm saying is,
my life is different now...

25:27.927 --> 25:30.919
...and one thing I've realized is
I don't want to be alone.

25:35.701 --> 25:39.193
Clark, you're not alone.

25:57.456 --> 26:00.152
I should get back inside.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.751
Lana, what is that?

26:05.731 --> 26:08.029
What, the tow truck?

26:11.303 --> 26:14.431
-It's the same sound as when Pete--
-Pete?

26:14.606 --> 26:15.834
Clark, what's going on?

26:16.442 --> 26:18.808
Lana, this is very important.
Go get my dad.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.849
-Help!
-Pete?

27:05.024 --> 27:06.821
Can anybody hear me?

27:06.992 --> 27:08.653
Pete!

27:08.861 --> 27:10.556
Clark!

27:10.796 --> 27:12.286
Clark, help!

27:12.798 --> 27:14.060
Clark, help!

27:14.233 --> 27:15.530
Shut up!

27:28.847 --> 27:30.314
Pete!

27:31.050 --> 27:32.915
Pete, where are you?

27:51.703 --> 27:53.796
How's that, blind man?

27:57.209 --> 27:59.541
Come on! Come on!

28:00.979 --> 28:02.606
Pete!

28:15.928 --> 28:19.261
-Any more improvement?
-A little, but everything's still a blur.

28:19.431 --> 28:23.299
-At least I won't walk through walls.
-What about your other abilities?

28:23.769 --> 28:26.363
The x-ray vision and heat vision,
they're still gone.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.701
Well, the heat from the torch
must've broken up the scar tissue.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.275
Maybe the rest will just
take time to heal.

28:32.578 --> 28:35.604
-Pete's still out there.
-Clark, Pete could be anywhere.

28:35.781 --> 28:37.772
You already told
Sheriff Adams everything.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.611
Well, I can't just sit here.

28:42.054 --> 28:46.150
Okay, but before we do anything else,
there's one stop we have to make.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.457
Clark, come on out.

28:55.934 --> 28:58.334
-Sweetie, they look fine.
-Yeah?

28:58.504 --> 28:59.732
-Yes.
-Yeah.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.634
Now, what's your plan to find Pete?

29:02.074 --> 29:05.737
The Masterson hearing is in an hour.
We know he's trying to set up an exchange.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.811
If Mrs. Ross lets him go,
I'll follow him.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.738
Son, that is such a long shot.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.415
That's all I've got.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.295
Was there any result with the change?

29:31.069 --> 29:32.934
All right, do it again.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.871
How long will that take?

29:37.376 --> 29:39.970
All right, call me when you're done.

29:42.648 --> 29:46.175
I guess this is the part where
I'm supposed to cough suggestively?

29:46.351 --> 29:48.285
I don't have any
new information on Clark.

29:48.453 --> 29:53.390
And if I did, I would've happily e-mailed
it to you, sans the three-hour drive.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.687
Would that have been before or after
you spoke to Lex?

29:57.062 --> 29:58.359
What are you talking about?

29:58.530 --> 30:01.192
You know, Miss Sullivan,
these coy evasions may work...

30:01.366 --> 30:06.235
...when you're wheedling information out of
the high school librarian, but up here...

30:06.405 --> 30:07.963
...you're out of your league.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.299
Mr. Luthor, what's this about?

30:11.476 --> 30:14.775
We had what I assumed
was a private conversation...

30:14.947 --> 30:17.279
...but imagine my surprise to have Lex...

30:17.449 --> 30:20.543
...throw my very own words
right back in my face.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.914
You led me to believe that you were
no longer in communication with Lex.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.722
Well, I'm not...

30:28.393 --> 30:32.762
...but thank you for
the wildly offensive insinuation.

30:32.931 --> 30:35.491
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm on a deadline.

30:36.034 --> 30:39.265
Not anymore. Your column
at the Daily Planet's been canceled.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.097
What?

30:47.246 --> 30:49.840
All right, all right. Here's the deal.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.950
Tell me everything you fed to Lex,
I'll let things stand.

30:53.118 --> 30:56.144
I told you, I'm not Lex's source.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.516
And while I'm sure you could
kill my column...

30:59.691 --> 31:02.819
...this isn't the only piece I'm working on
for the Daily Planet.

31:02.995 --> 31:06.624
I know I could interest them in a story
about an eccentric billionaire...

31:06.798 --> 31:09.426
...with an obsessive interest
in a Kansas farm boy.

31:17.743 --> 31:19.438
Are you threatening me?

31:25.584 --> 31:28.451
I'd be careful, Miss Sullivan.
Very careful.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.184
I'll be whatever I want.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.652
Apparently, I don't work for you anymore.

31:53.612 --> 31:57.104
Judge, I've got people fanning out from
that garage trying to find your son.

31:57.282 --> 32:00.046
-But we are running out of time.
-I know.

32:00.218 --> 32:03.949
Releasing Masterson goes against
everything that I believe in.

32:04.122 --> 32:06.090
But if I don't...

32:06.425 --> 32:08.655
...it could mean Pete's life.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.696
Look at him.
He knows he has us over a barrel.

32:13.231 --> 32:14.528
What are you gonna do?

32:15.200 --> 32:17.259
Until the hearing starts, pray.

32:37.255 --> 32:38.916
Hello?

32:39.091 --> 32:41.355
-Nathan.
-Talk to me.

32:41.526 --> 32:42.823
Everything's set.

32:42.994 --> 32:45.588
If this judge is smart,
I'll be out in 20 minutes.

32:45.764 --> 32:48.597
Cool. Then it worked?
So what do you want me to do next?

32:48.767 --> 32:52.294
When I'm out, get rid of the Ross kid.
We'll meet as planned in Metropolis.

32:52.738 --> 32:56.174
Done. Ross 'll be a pile of junk in a minute.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.870
Pete!

33:33.712 --> 33:35.111
Hey, you work here?

33:35.714 --> 33:37.773
What the hell?
What are you doing here?

33:38.450 --> 33:41.112
-Where's Pete?
-ln a minute, neither one of you will care.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.171
Help me!

34:06.711 --> 34:08.303
Can anybody hear me?

34:08.947 --> 34:10.847
Help me!

34:11.183 --> 34:12.810
Help!

34:21.460 --> 34:23.690
Pete! Pete, are you okay?

34:24.429 --> 34:25.690
Clark.

34:36.208 --> 34:39.574
And that's the way I pulled myself
out of the compactor and got away.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.610
Oh, my God.
That's the bravest thing I've ever heard.

34:42.781 --> 34:46.842
Well, you know, if I didn't do something
fast, I'd be Spam in a can, so....

34:47.018 --> 34:49.213
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.518
Call me.

34:51.989 --> 34:54.254
I will do that.

34:54.626 --> 34:58.392
I have a feeling I'll be hearing
this story for a long time.

34:58.563 --> 35:00.190
Busted.

35:00.365 --> 35:03.391
Well, you know, what can I say?
Chicks dig a hero.

35:04.169 --> 35:06.160
Hope you don't mind
I'm bending the truth.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.829
Look who you're talking to,
the master truth-bender.

35:09.007 --> 35:12.374
After everything you've done for me,
it's the least I can do.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.072
What's the matter?

35:14.246 --> 35:17.340
My eyes are just adjusting.
I think I need a new prescription.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.777
Hey.

35:19.751 --> 35:23.050
Hey, Chloe.
Hey, I'm ready for my big Torch interview.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.883
Sorry, Pete,
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

35:26.057 --> 35:30.255
-I'm really glad you're feeling better.
-Chloe, what's the matter?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.225
-I just lost my Daily Planet column.
-What?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.458
Why?

35:38.637 --> 35:41.800
They didn't exactly spell it out
on the pink slip.

35:42.374 --> 35:47.141
In the "when it rains, it pours" category,
my dad just got laid off from LuthorCorp.

35:47.312 --> 35:49.872
That doesn't make sense.
He's worked there for years.

35:50.415 --> 35:53.441
If you want answers, ask Lex.
He's the one that dropped the ax.

36:04.529 --> 36:08.363
Clark. I heard about
your miraculous recovery.

36:08.533 --> 36:11.900
I just found out that you fired
Chloe's father today.

36:13.271 --> 36:18.072
Yeah, well, apparently,
his performance was seriously lacking.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.972
He's worked for the company for years.
This could ruin Chloe's family.

36:23.682 --> 36:28.176
My father suspects Mr. Sullivan was the one
spreading the malicious rumors about me.

36:28.353 --> 36:31.288
I assumed Chloe overheard the gossip
and passed it along to you.

36:31.456 --> 36:34.084
-No, this isn't right.
-It's not about being right.

36:34.259 --> 36:36.193
It's about positioning.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.762
-My father won a battle today.
-And Chloe's father is a casualty.

36:40.131 --> 36:43.259
True, but the war's just starting...

36:43.435 --> 36:45.926
...and I have the greatest advantage:

36:46.104 --> 36:47.332
He thinks I'm weak.

36:51.776 --> 36:54.142
Frankly, Clark,
I thought you'd be relieved.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.905
-Why would you think that?
-Because at least this way...

36:58.083 --> 37:00.779
...I was able to keep you out of it.

37:27.212 --> 37:29.703
Looks like you're back to normal.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.711
Hey, Lana.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.289
I'm glad you're here.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.526
I wanted to talk about
what happened in the truck.

37:43.928 --> 37:46.829
Right. I wanted to talk to you
about that too.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.191
I was way out of line.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.865
-I felt vulnerable, but I don't expect--
-Clark....

37:57.609 --> 37:59.907
The reason I pulled away...

38:01.112 --> 38:03.239
...is that...

38:04.416 --> 38:06.680
...I met someone at the hospital.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.752
And I'm not sure how I feel about him.

38:16.494 --> 38:21.431
Well, I mean, the fact you're telling me
about him means you already know.

38:25.336 --> 38:27.304
Maybe you're right...

38:28.073 --> 38:31.338
...but if you and l
are going to be friends...

38:31.509 --> 38:33.909
...I didn't want you to find out
from somebody else.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.847
Yeah. Yeah.

38:41.820 --> 38:45.312
Well, I should get back to the Talon.

38:50.628 --> 38:52.653
Hey, Lana?

38:57.035 --> 38:59.663
Thanks for being honest.

39:03.475 --> 39:06.808
Well, it's the only way
a relationship can last, right?
