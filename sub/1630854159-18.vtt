WEBVTT

00:02.174 --> 00:04.245
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i> You're back.

00:04.383 --> 00:05.419
Another crazy story--

00:05.557 --> 00:06.730
how could I stay away?

00:06.868 --> 00:08.767
This gonna take long?
Because, uh, we got work to do.

00:08.905 --> 00:09.906
I heard
you were happy with how

00:10.044 --> 00:11.149
the last documentary
came out.

00:11.287 --> 00:13.185
Oh, my God.
It was so good, and-- and--

00:13.323 --> 00:15.601
And I got so many compliments.

00:15.739 --> 00:18.259
Oh, that's great.
How about you?

00:18.397 --> 00:19.674
Didn't see it.

00:21.642 --> 00:24.438
We found four kilos of black tar
heroin inside of it.

00:24.576 --> 00:27.268
What? Yo, that's crazy.

00:27.406 --> 00:28.442
Um...

00:28.580 --> 00:30.030
That is disturbing.

00:31.134 --> 00:34.137
Captions by VIT--

00:35.518 --> 00:38.279
Oh, what is taking so long?

00:40.488 --> 00:42.007
- Do I look okay?
- You look hot.

00:42.145 --> 00:43.008
Right?

00:43.146 --> 00:44.665
God, I mean,
this lip balm.

00:44.803 --> 00:46.115
It's fire.

00:46.253 --> 00:48.048
So, what are we
doing here?

00:48.186 --> 00:49.221
Girl, you know
what we're doing.

00:49.359 --> 00:52.224
No.
For, like, posperiority.

00:52.362 --> 00:54.882
I think it's "posterity."

00:55.020 --> 00:56.780
Mnh-mnh. That don't sound
right, girl.

00:56.918 --> 00:58.127
Okay. So...

01:00.198 --> 01:02.200
...I'm waiting for Jake
to get out of prison.
Mm-hmm.

01:02.338 --> 01:03.925
He just did six months
on a drug charge,

01:04.064 --> 01:05.755
and I found out today
he's getting released early.

01:05.893 --> 01:07.067
Ooh.
For good behavior?

01:07.205 --> 01:08.378
Girl. Overcrowding.

01:09.552 --> 01:10.484
Baby!

01:10.622 --> 01:12.520
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:13.935 --> 01:15.903
Mmm!
Mmm.

01:16.041 --> 01:17.387
Baby.
Oh, I missed you.

01:17.525 --> 01:18.423
Yeah.
I missed you, too.

01:18.561 --> 01:20.218
Yo, Lisa!

01:21.357 --> 01:22.496
Hey!

01:22.634 --> 01:23.669
How are you doing?

01:23.807 --> 01:24.843
I'm good!
How are you?

01:24.981 --> 01:25.913
Good.
Alright. Alright.

01:26.051 --> 01:27.052
What do you want
to do first?

01:27.190 --> 01:27.984
You know what I want
to do first.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.503
No. After that.

01:29.641 --> 01:31.056
You know, you said
you been thinking in prison.

01:31.194 --> 01:33.334
Are we going straight
or what?

01:33.472 --> 01:35.647
Nah. Screw that.
Let's be bad.

01:35.785 --> 01:36.924
Yes.

01:38.236 --> 01:39.892
You ready?

01:41.031 --> 01:43.517
Ahh.

01:43.655 --> 01:45.726
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Drop the gun!

01:48.315 --> 01:50.420
Get off me!
Get off me!

01:50.558 --> 01:52.422
This was an assassination.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.044
Baby?
Baby, look out!

01:54.183 --> 01:55.908
Look out! Look out!

02:08.887 --> 02:10.026
Sergeant.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.027
Sgt. Grey:
Hey. Good morning.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.098
Good morning.
How you been?

02:13.236 --> 02:15.100
Fine. Uh, busy.

02:15.238 --> 02:16.274
Yeah?

02:16.412 --> 02:18.793
Yeah. Um...
I-I'm sorry.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.312
I'm still
a little unclear

02:20.450 --> 02:21.934
what your documentary
is about this time.

02:22.072 --> 02:23.729
I mean,
what are the odds

02:23.867 --> 02:25.490
that two cops would end up
arresting two criminals

02:25.628 --> 02:26.732
who look just like them?

02:26.870 --> 02:28.803
Small.
Infinitesimal.

02:28.941 --> 02:29.942
And this is gonna be, like,
a whole movie?

02:30.080 --> 02:31.047
I hope so.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.566
All I can do
is start filming

02:32.704 --> 02:33.981
and see
where it takes me.

02:34.119 --> 02:35.224
Here she is.

02:35.362 --> 02:36.156
Hi.

02:39.055 --> 02:40.746
I'm a little nervous.

02:40.884 --> 02:42.334
Why? You're an old pro
at this point.

02:42.472 --> 02:43.922
I-I know,

02:44.060 --> 02:45.165
but, you know,
the other documentaries,

02:45.303 --> 02:48.340
they weren't about... me.

02:48.478 --> 02:50.170
You're not interviewing me
with Tim this time?

02:50.308 --> 02:51.895
No, I thought
it would be valuable

02:52.033 --> 02:53.414
to hear from you separately.

02:53.552 --> 02:54.588
Okay.

02:54.726 --> 02:56.900
So, how did you first meet
Jake Butler?

02:57.038 --> 02:58.143
A case.

02:58.281 --> 02:59.489
My roommate, Tamara,

02:59.627 --> 03:01.250
bought a car
at a police auction,

03:01.388 --> 03:03.493
only to find drugs
hidden inside.

03:03.631 --> 03:06.358
So, we traced that back to Jake
and arrested him.

03:06.496 --> 03:08.153
Which brings us
to the elephant in the room.

03:09.913 --> 03:11.881
Right. Yeah.
The whole look-alike thing.

03:14.263 --> 03:15.747
He really didn't look
that much like me.

03:17.507 --> 03:19.544
How can you say that?
You look almost identical.

03:20.683 --> 03:21.960
Says you.

03:22.098 --> 03:24.445
Says me.
They could have been twins.

03:24.583 --> 03:26.102
Why do you think
they called him Dim?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.277
Wait. What?

03:28.415 --> 03:30.210
Oh, yeah.

03:30.348 --> 03:33.213
We nicknamed
Tim's doppelganger "Dim."

03:33.351 --> 03:34.938
That's funny,
but also a little prejudicial,

03:35.076 --> 03:36.526
don't you think?

03:36.664 --> 03:38.252
In what way?

03:38.390 --> 03:40.220
I mean, the fact that you were
denigrating his intelligence

03:40.358 --> 03:41.876
comes to mind.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.568
I mean, if the shoe fits.

03:43.706 --> 03:46.398
Look, when you have been doing
this job as long as I have,

03:46.536 --> 03:49.574
it becomes very clear
that most criminals are...

03:49.712 --> 03:51.300
well, dim.

03:51.438 --> 03:53.233
No comment.

03:53.371 --> 03:54.648
Well, just 'cause
you're too nice.

03:54.786 --> 03:59.342
I-I would say a good 70% of
the people we arrest

03:59.480 --> 04:03.070
couldn't explain
how a revolving door works.

04:03.208 --> 04:04.899
Okay. Maybe 30%.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.419
Yeah. Anyway, the job
is super stressful,

04:07.557 --> 04:09.318
and cops have
a dark sense of humor.

04:09.456 --> 04:11.837
- So a nickname was born.
- Wait.

04:11.975 --> 04:15.496
If you called Jake "Dim,"
what did you call Sava?

04:15.634 --> 04:16.739
Hello?!

04:16.877 --> 04:17.981
- Juicy.
- Juicy.

04:18.119 --> 04:19.397
Juicy.

04:19.535 --> 04:22.262
Juicy.

04:23.401 --> 04:25.748
They called her..."Juicy."

04:25.886 --> 04:27.267
"They"?

04:27.405 --> 04:29.510
We did.
We-- Look, I...

04:29.648 --> 04:32.962
I really tried not to,
but it was a losing battle.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.412
And then you
and Sergeant Bradford

04:34.550 --> 04:36.517
went undercover
as your doppelgangers,

04:36.655 --> 04:38.105
- Dim and Juicy.
- Yes.

04:38.243 --> 04:40.625
So, uh, Tim first,
and then I joined him

04:40.763 --> 04:42.316
on a UC operation in Las Vegas,

04:42.454 --> 04:44.974
where we put some
very bad people behind bars.

04:45.112 --> 04:46.044
And was it around
this time

04:46.182 --> 04:48.805
that you and Tim
became intimate?

04:48.943 --> 04:52.257
N-- [ Sighs ] N-No.

04:52.395 --> 04:54.086
We-- We had to pretend
at intimacy

04:54.224 --> 04:55.985
while we were undercover.

04:56.123 --> 04:58.470
But Tim and I were both
in relationships at the time.

04:58.608 --> 05:02.129
We didn't start dating
until after, you know,

05:02.267 --> 05:03.717
when-- when we were
both single again.

05:03.855 --> 05:04.890
I want to dial in
on that.

05:05.028 --> 05:06.444
Do we have to?
I...

05:06.582 --> 05:08.411
The odds of you and Tim
coming face-to-face

05:08.549 --> 05:11.380
with Dim and Juicy
are already astronomical,

05:11.518 --> 05:13.554
but for both couples
to hook up--

05:13.692 --> 05:15.384
Interview's over.
I need Chen. Hey.

05:15.522 --> 05:16.626
Hey.
Oh. What's wrong?

05:16.764 --> 05:17.558
Not here.

05:18.870 --> 05:20.216
Uh, excuse me.

05:20.354 --> 05:21.459
Yeah.

05:27.879 --> 05:30.744
Nolan and Celina responded
to a missing-persons call.

05:30.882 --> 05:32.711
It was Sava.
Jake's missing.

05:32.849 --> 05:33.747
What?

05:39.097 --> 05:40.236
Oh.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.687
Uh, my boyfriend, Jake,
he's missing.

05:42.825 --> 05:44.689
I-I-I can't find him.

05:44.827 --> 05:46.000
Hello?! Hello?!

05:46.138 --> 05:46.863
Yeah. No.
Okay. Yeah.

05:47.001 --> 05:48.762
Uh, just slow down.

05:48.900 --> 05:49.935
Start at the beginning.

05:50.073 --> 05:51.178
- Tell us what happened.
- Okay.

05:51.316 --> 05:53.214
Uh, we--
we were in the study.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.251
He was getting a beer,
grabbing me my lobster salad,

05:55.389 --> 05:57.046
and, um,
he just disappeared.

05:57.184 --> 05:58.944
- I don't know where he went.
- Back up.

05:59.082 --> 06:02.120
What were Dim and Juicy doing
at a Beverly Hills mansion?

06:02.258 --> 06:03.949
Have you seen the movie
"Parasite"?

06:04.087 --> 06:06.020
Yeah, after Dim got
out of prison,

06:06.158 --> 06:08.437
he and Juicy started targeting
rich people a-and celebrities,

06:08.575 --> 06:10.784
getting hired to work
at their homes.

06:10.922 --> 06:13.959
Handymen, chefs, nannies.

06:14.097 --> 06:15.340
When you say
"celebrities"...

06:15.478 --> 06:16.962
Lance Bass.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.792
I hired those two
to take care of my house.

06:18.930 --> 06:19.689
Is that Lance Bass?

06:19.827 --> 06:21.035
Well, Jake first.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.382
Hey, guys!

06:22.520 --> 06:24.901
Uh, but then
my sensualist quit,

06:25.039 --> 06:27.041
and, uh,
Jake recommended Sava.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.905
I'm sorry.
What's a sensualist?

06:29.043 --> 06:31.563
They optimize the pleasurability
of your surroundings.

06:31.701 --> 06:34.635
Every element, from the tactile
to the olfactory.

06:34.773 --> 06:36.637
I have an incredibly
stressful job,

06:36.775 --> 06:40.641
so I want every aspect
of my home experience to be...

06:40.779 --> 06:42.643
euphoric.

06:42.781 --> 06:44.956
Oh.

06:45.094 --> 06:46.889
More colorful.

06:47.027 --> 06:48.787
An alien would never dance
like that.

06:48.925 --> 06:50.824
Mm, uh...

06:51.790 --> 06:53.067
The mac and cheese.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.068
Sorry about that.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.587
No problem.

06:55.725 --> 06:57.002
So what happened
after you hired them?

06:57.140 --> 06:58.901
I fired them.
Why?

06:59.039 --> 07:01.110
During the three days
they worked for me,

07:01.248 --> 07:03.664
they had sex on every surface
of my house.

07:03.802 --> 07:05.183
By "every," you mean...

07:05.321 --> 07:08.013
Every even vaguely
flat surface--

07:08.151 --> 07:13.018
floors, beds, couches, dressers,
counters, the diving board.

07:13.156 --> 07:14.917
Even inside the dog crate.

07:15.055 --> 07:17.126
It was only
after Dim and Juicy were gone

07:17.264 --> 07:19.128
that he discovered
they'd also stolen

07:19.266 --> 07:22.372
several expensive watches
and some jewelry.

07:22.511 --> 07:24.133
- Were they arrested?
- No.

07:24.271 --> 07:26.204
By the time police
questioned them,

07:26.342 --> 07:28.171
the stolen property
was gone.

07:28.309 --> 07:30.035
Likely pawned,
so there wasn't

07:30.173 --> 07:31.865
enough evidence
to press charges.

07:32.003 --> 07:34.626
What we didn't know
at that point was

07:34.764 --> 07:38.250
that Dim and Juicy were already
casing out their next target.

07:38.388 --> 07:40.045
Mm.
The Baudelaires.

07:40.183 --> 07:41.633
Oh, baby,
this place is perfect.

07:41.771 --> 07:43.117
Oh. No.
It's on us.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.361
Ooh. Right there.
That's our in.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.570
Listen to me.

07:47.708 --> 07:49.538
You go back to that house,
I'll shoot you in the face!

07:49.676 --> 07:50.815
You got it?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.062
Sent the guy packing.
Took his job.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.478
Well, they caught a break

07:58.616 --> 08:00.238
when Jake showed up
to work on day one

08:00.376 --> 08:02.067
and discovered
that the Baudelaire family

08:02.205 --> 08:03.724
had recently lost their nanny.

08:03.862 --> 08:05.899
So Juicy
slid right in.

08:08.073 --> 08:09.903
What?

08:10.041 --> 08:13.354
That's just a really descriptive
way to put that.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.391
How long did they work there
before Dim went missing?

08:15.529 --> 08:17.151
Three weeks.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.740
And what can you tell me
about the Baudelaires?

08:19.878 --> 08:21.501
They were made of money.

08:21.639 --> 08:22.743
And-- And then he just disappeared.

08:22.881 --> 08:25.021
I-I don't know
what happened to him.

08:25.159 --> 08:27.230
Karen, why is there
a police car outside?

08:27.368 --> 08:28.646
Karen?

08:28.784 --> 08:30.751
I'm sorry,
Mr. Baudelaire, but, um,

08:30.889 --> 08:32.512
Skip is missing.

08:32.650 --> 08:35.307
Uh, sorry. And by Skip, you m--
you mean Jake?

08:36.792 --> 08:38.690
Yes. Yes.

08:38.828 --> 08:40.485
Uh, Skip and I, you know,
we got pet names for each other.

08:40.623 --> 08:41.762
He calls me Sava.
I call him Jake.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.039
It's not...

08:43.177 --> 08:44.593
That's not even--
Okay.

08:44.731 --> 08:47.009
So ha-- hang on a second.
I just need...

08:47.147 --> 08:48.079
First of all,
your name is?

08:48.217 --> 08:49.356
Charles Baudelaire.

08:49.494 --> 08:51.220
- And this is your house?
- Yes.

08:51.358 --> 08:53.394
I know, right?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.293
Oh, Meredith, you have to try
this cleanse.

08:55.431 --> 08:57.019
Like, I have dropped
an entire size.

08:57.157 --> 08:58.779
Yeah, and I have to get all
my clothes tailored now, but--

08:58.917 --> 09:00.712
Oh, my God.
The cops are here.

09:00.850 --> 09:02.127
Look at this.

09:02.265 --> 09:04.371
And this is my wife, Camille.

09:04.509 --> 09:06.062
Karen says
that Skip is missing.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.547
How awful.

09:07.685 --> 09:09.307
Oh, God.
Did you hear that?

09:09.445 --> 09:11.792
Apparently, now our handyman
is missing.

09:11.930 --> 09:15.037
Okay.
I need to unpack all of this.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.246
I think the fastest way
to do it would be

09:17.384 --> 09:19.973
to get a statement
from you first.

09:20.111 --> 09:21.319
Officer Juarez,
will you please

09:21.457 --> 09:22.734
take the Baudelaires
into the living room?

09:22.872 --> 09:24.978
Sure.
Sir, ma'am, do you mind?

09:25.116 --> 09:26.324
I'm super confused,
but okay.

09:26.462 --> 09:27.739
Hey, Meredith,
I have to go.

09:27.877 --> 09:28.982
But, girl, you have to try
this cleanse.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.604
I'm serious.

09:30.742 --> 09:32.330
This is why it took so long
to call you guys.

09:32.468 --> 09:33.573
Because you're doing
something illegal.

09:33.711 --> 09:35.747
No. No.

09:35.885 --> 09:37.231
Jake and I,
we have gone straight.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.062
I am working here
as a nanny.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.995
And he is a handyman.

09:42.133 --> 09:44.169
Like I said, a lot to unpack.
Let's stay on track.

09:44.307 --> 09:45.723
You said Jake
disappeared?

09:45.861 --> 09:46.724
Mm-hmm.

09:46.862 --> 09:49.830
Babe.
Hey!

09:49.968 --> 09:52.143
Hey, what-- what time--
what time they back?

09:52.281 --> 09:53.731
Like 3:00.

09:53.869 --> 09:55.111
3:00. Alright.

09:55.249 --> 09:56.112
Remind me to clear that
security footage, alright?

09:56.250 --> 09:57.666
We don't want
another mishap

09:57.804 --> 09:59.081
like that last
Halloween situation.

09:59.219 --> 10:00.738
Yeah.
That's true.

10:00.876 --> 10:02.291
Oh!

10:02.429 --> 10:03.948
I'mma get me
another beer.

10:04.086 --> 10:05.259
You want anything?

10:05.397 --> 10:07.192
Yeah.

10:07.330 --> 10:09.850
Can you see if they got
that lobster salad?

10:09.988 --> 10:11.024
Lobster salad. Yeah.

10:11.162 --> 10:12.025
Yeah, I'll get you
lobster salad.

10:12.163 --> 10:14.165
Lobster salad!
All day.

10:14.303 --> 10:15.235
Lobster salad life.

10:15.373 --> 10:16.443
Ooh!
You love it?

10:16.581 --> 10:19.204
Lobster sa--

10:19.342 --> 10:21.759
Okay, so Dim walked
into the hallway at 2:03 p.m.

10:21.897 --> 10:23.864
But there are no cameras
- in that hallway.
- Right.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.866
So he walked out of this shot
at 2:03.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.559
And never emerged
from the hallway.

10:29.698 --> 10:31.285
We have hours more footage
of those two rooms,

10:31.423 --> 10:33.391
but Dim never reappears.

10:33.529 --> 10:35.220
That's unusual,
to say the least.

10:35.358 --> 10:36.877
Do you have a theory
on what happened?

10:37.015 --> 10:38.879
No, but Juicy
sure did.

10:39.017 --> 10:40.640
Okay.

10:40.778 --> 10:42.469
Alien abduction.

10:42.607 --> 10:44.644
Oh, yeah.
Later, she added, uh,

10:44.782 --> 10:46.576
"portal
to another dimension."

10:46.715 --> 10:49.718
But she didn't appreciate
your suggestion.

10:49.856 --> 10:51.236
Spontaneous combustion.

10:51.374 --> 10:53.342
Oh. Like
the drummers in Spinal Tap.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.137
Thank you for getting
the reference.

10:55.275 --> 10:57.415
So we opened up
an investigation.

10:57.553 --> 10:59.313
Most likely the explanation
is just that

10:59.451 --> 11:01.315
there was a glitch
in the security system.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.558
Right.
But why wouldn't he tell Juicy

11:02.696 --> 11:04.146
where he was going?

11:04.284 --> 11:06.079
Relationships
are complicated.

11:06.217 --> 11:08.702
Every couple has their secrets,
you know?

11:08.840 --> 11:11.636
No matter how strong
their moral compasses may be.

11:11.774 --> 11:13.431
Mm.

11:13.569 --> 11:16.158
Which is something Jake and Sava
clearly didn't have.

11:16.296 --> 11:18.678
Do Tim and I keep secrets
from each other?

11:18.816 --> 11:21.266
I mean... nothing big.

11:21.404 --> 11:23.027
I-I feel that honesty is
the most important thing

11:23.165 --> 11:24.753
in a relationship.

11:24.891 --> 11:27.100
I'm literally sitting
in this office

11:27.238 --> 11:28.757
because of a secret
she kept.

11:28.895 --> 11:30.759
Despite everything,
it really did seem

11:30.897 --> 11:33.278
like Dim and Juicy
loved each other.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.695
Which made what happened next
so tragic.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.282
7-Lincoln-7.

11:37.420 --> 11:40.182
Code 6 at 911 call location.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.942
Any clarity on the smell
they reported?

11:42.080 --> 11:45.118
<i>That's a negative, 7-Lincoln-7.</i>

11:47.258 --> 11:49.570
I mean,
it's an alley in L.A.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.263
They all smell.
It'd be a miracle if it didn't.

12:15.424 --> 12:16.908
7-Lincoln-7.

12:17.046 --> 12:18.151
Send an R.A. to my location,

12:18.289 --> 12:19.877
and alert Sergeant Grey.

12:20.015 --> 12:22.362
I just found a body,
and it's Sergeant Tim Bradford.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.088
What?

12:24.226 --> 12:25.675
Give me that.

12:25.814 --> 12:28.540
No, it's not.
I'm at the station.

12:28.678 --> 12:30.508
I-It was Dim, obviously.

12:30.646 --> 12:33.200
But, you know, in the moment,
I-I-I thought it was Tim.

12:33.338 --> 12:35.064
And, um...

12:35.202 --> 12:36.825
you know, anybody could have
made that mistake.

12:36.963 --> 12:39.275
He's not wrong.
They looked so much alike.

12:39.413 --> 12:42.727
My mind broke a little
when I saw Dim's body.

12:42.865 --> 12:44.108
Why were you there?

12:44.246 --> 12:46.006
We responded to Aaron's call
for an ambulance,

12:46.144 --> 12:47.836
but there was nothing
we could do.

12:47.974 --> 12:49.976
Dim was... way dead. Yeah.

12:50.114 --> 12:52.702
Rigor mortis had come and gone,
blowfly eggs had been laid,

12:52.841 --> 12:54.118
but hair slippage
hadn't started yet,

12:54.256 --> 12:56.189
which placed
the time of death

12:56.327 --> 12:58.950
approximately 30 hours
before Aaron found the body.

12:59.088 --> 13:02.540
So around 6:00 p.m.
the day of Jake's disappearance.

13:02.678 --> 13:04.680
Did it bother you,
seeing his body?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.302
What do you mean?

13:06.440 --> 13:08.201
To see a version of yourself
dead in a dumpster,

13:08.339 --> 13:09.305
no matter how much
you protest

13:09.443 --> 13:11.135
that you don't see
the resemblance,

13:11.273 --> 13:13.240
I mean, it had to be
a little disconcerting.

13:14.483 --> 13:16.347
Yeah, a little, I guess.

13:16.485 --> 13:18.383
I have nightmares.

13:18.521 --> 13:20.040
Do you think Tim does?

13:20.178 --> 13:22.077
No.

13:22.215 --> 13:24.389
You know, he's been doing the
job a lot longer than I have,

13:24.527 --> 13:26.702
so his walls are pretty high.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.635
But, you know,
they have to be.

13:28.773 --> 13:31.155
Otherwise, the constant violence
would just consume you.

13:31.293 --> 13:33.019
Sounds like a part of you
is envious

13:33.157 --> 13:36.712
that he can divorce himself
from feeling a lot more easily.

13:36.850 --> 13:37.955
No, I...

13:38.093 --> 13:39.404
Listen.

13:39.542 --> 13:43.512
Empathy can be painful,
but the alternative,

13:43.650 --> 13:46.722
at least for me,
is unthinkable.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.068
I do this job to help people.

13:48.206 --> 13:49.656
You know, I have to feel
for them.

13:49.794 --> 13:52.210
Do the walls make it hard to be
in a relationship with Tim?

13:52.348 --> 13:53.591
No.

13:53.729 --> 13:57.491
But that's because I know,
behind those walls,

13:57.629 --> 14:00.149
he's just a big softy.

14:00.287 --> 14:02.738
Do I look like a big softy?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.188
No, sir.

14:04.326 --> 14:06.500
So, Officer Thorsen
found the body.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.089
Dim disappeared from the mansion
at 2:03 p.m.

14:09.227 --> 14:10.504
and was killed
four hours later.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.610
So we had new mysteries
to solve.

14:12.748 --> 14:14.336
How did Dim get out
of the house?

14:14.474 --> 14:17.270
Where was he for those
missing four hours?

14:17.408 --> 14:19.789
And how did he end up shot dead
in a dumpster?

14:19.928 --> 14:22.275
Unfortunately, there were
no security cameras

14:22.413 --> 14:23.483
around the alley,

14:23.621 --> 14:25.623
so they had no idea
who dumped the body.

14:25.761 --> 14:28.281
It was at this point
that Detective Lopez and I

14:28.419 --> 14:30.524
were assigned
to the investigation.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.423
Miss Wu, thank you
for coming in.

14:32.561 --> 14:33.838
Yeah. Sure.

14:33.976 --> 14:35.288
What's with
all the cameras?

14:35.426 --> 14:36.910
They're filming
a documentary.

14:37.048 --> 14:38.981
I would love to interview you
at some point.

14:39.119 --> 14:41.294
Don't worry about them.
Let's go talk.

14:41.432 --> 14:44.228
Uh, you want a water, coffee, anything?

14:44.366 --> 14:45.677
No, thank you.

14:45.815 --> 14:47.058
Okay, this way.

14:47.196 --> 14:48.301
Go. Go.
Get ahead of them.

14:55.446 --> 14:57.413
Did you guys
find anything?

14:57.551 --> 15:00.002
Uh, we-- we're following up
on a couple of leads,

15:00.140 --> 15:03.178
but, uh, we need your help to
get some clarity on some things.

15:04.179 --> 15:05.628
Do you mind
if we record this?

15:05.766 --> 15:07.596
No.
I-- Whatever you need.

15:09.460 --> 15:10.254
How you holding up?

15:13.464 --> 15:15.328
I mean,
I'm not gonna lie.

15:15.466 --> 15:17.571
You know, I'm struggling.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.332
I still can't believe
he's dead.

15:19.470 --> 15:21.921
Look, we know you
and Mr. Butler

15:22.059 --> 15:24.751
were engaged in
a host of illegal activities,

15:24.889 --> 15:26.856
but we're not focused
- on that right now.
- Yeah.

15:26.995 --> 15:29.169
All we care about is catching
the person who killed him.

15:29.307 --> 15:31.689
So, if you are holding back
because you're afraid

15:31.827 --> 15:34.450
that you are gonna
get in trouble, stop.

15:34.588 --> 15:36.004
You need to come clean.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.524
Hey.
Sorry to intrude.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.250
- Uh, you got a second?
- Uh, yeah.

15:41.388 --> 15:42.769
Excuse us.

15:48.154 --> 15:49.431
What's up?

15:49.569 --> 15:50.501
They found
another body.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.956
Sgt. Grey: In the days following
Dim's disappearance,

15:57.094 --> 15:59.096
officers were searching
the property, looking for him.

15:59.234 --> 16:02.099
In the confusion
after finding Dim's body,

16:02.237 --> 16:04.964
the call to stop the search
wasn't made.

16:05.102 --> 16:06.586
Whose body did they find?

16:12.523 --> 16:13.662
Holy

16:14.904 --> 16:17.286
It's the Baudelaires' nanny,
Holland Po.

16:17.424 --> 16:19.219
What-- I thought she was
out of the picture

16:19.357 --> 16:21.739
before Sava
and Jake showed up.

16:21.877 --> 16:25.398
Maybe they popped her
before Dim beat up the handyman.

16:25.536 --> 16:27.848
Well, the nanny's been dead
over a month.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.850
The handyman got beat up
three weeks ago.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.129
Why kill her and then wait
to strong-arm him?

16:32.267 --> 16:33.854
Let's go ask her.

16:40.723 --> 16:42.553
Tell me about Holland Po.

16:42.691 --> 16:43.968
Who's that?

16:44.106 --> 16:46.074
The Baudelaires' nanny
before you.

16:46.212 --> 16:48.593
Oh. I mean,
I-I never met her.

16:48.731 --> 16:51.596
She was gone before we even
knew about the Baudelaires.

16:51.734 --> 16:53.357
Can you prove that?

16:53.495 --> 16:55.186
Turns out she could. Yeah.

16:55.324 --> 16:57.016
Dim and Juicy were actually
on vacation in the Caribbean

16:57.154 --> 16:58.603
at the time
of the nanny's murder.

16:58.741 --> 17:00.088
Paid for by the sale
of the property

17:00.226 --> 17:01.675
they stole
from Lance Bass.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.091
Which turned our attention

17:03.229 --> 17:05.886
to the most obvious
suspects--

17:06.025 --> 17:07.612
The Baudelaires.
The Bau--
The Baudelaires.

17:07.750 --> 17:10.305
Sorry. No, you-- you--
you can say it. No.

17:10.443 --> 17:11.651
I just felt like
- I had some momentum.
- They'll just cut around me.

17:11.789 --> 17:12.893
I was building it up.
You kind of jumped in there.

17:13.032 --> 17:13.722
That's--
That's all right. Sorry.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.279
It's uncanny.

17:19.417 --> 17:21.661
It's freaky is what it is.

17:21.799 --> 17:23.387
You look like twins.

17:23.525 --> 17:25.527
Okay, let's get
back on track here.

17:25.665 --> 17:28.012
You say that Holland did not
show up for work that Tuesday.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.462
And you never heard
from her?

17:29.600 --> 17:30.980
That's right.

17:31.119 --> 17:33.880
No call, no text,
no e-mail, no Snapchat,

17:34.018 --> 17:35.640
no ClipTalk, no--We get it.

17:35.778 --> 17:38.298
And you were never aware
- that she went missing?
- No.

17:38.436 --> 17:39.644
We were paying her
under the table,

17:39.782 --> 17:41.129
so I guess no one knew
to contact us.

17:41.267 --> 17:42.406
Should we have
our lawyer here?

17:42.544 --> 17:43.510
That's up to you.

17:43.648 --> 17:44.994
But then it becomes
a whole thing.

17:45.133 --> 17:46.893
Yeah. Right now, we are just
trying to get some clarity.

17:47.031 --> 17:48.550
It can't be a coincidence

17:48.688 --> 17:51.139
that two people that work
for you showed up murdered.

17:51.277 --> 17:52.726
You're looking
at the wrong people.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.660
I mean, we were scammed
by Karen and Skip--

17:55.798 --> 17:57.490
Jake and Sava.
Whatever their real names are.

17:57.628 --> 17:59.423
We're the real victims here.
Of course.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.321
But without
another suspect,

18:01.459 --> 18:03.910
you can see why
we are talking to you.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.567
Jesse.

18:05.705 --> 18:06.671
Who's Jesse?

18:06.809 --> 18:08.846
So, Mr. Long,

18:08.984 --> 18:12.643
you worked for the Baudelaires
as a contractor for three years.

18:12.781 --> 18:13.885
That's right.

18:14.023 --> 18:15.818
What exactly
did you do for them?

18:15.956 --> 18:18.338
I'm sorry.
I can't say.

18:18.476 --> 18:21.686
I signed an NDA.
I don't want to get sued.

18:21.824 --> 18:25.173
Getting sued is the least
of your problems right now.

18:25.311 --> 18:27.175
Let's just say
that I handled everything

18:27.313 --> 18:29.694
from repairs
to new construction.

18:29.832 --> 18:31.800
What can you tell me
about Holland Po?

18:33.319 --> 18:34.389
What do you want to know?

18:35.976 --> 18:37.702
I mean...

18:37.840 --> 18:40.015
she worked as a nanny while
I did some repairs on the house.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.844
Nice girl.

18:41.982 --> 18:44.053
Did you two get along?

18:44.192 --> 18:46.711
Yeah.
I mean, I didn't see her much.

18:46.849 --> 18:48.541
You know, you stopped working
for the Baudelaires

18:48.679 --> 18:51.682
less than a week
after she disappeared.

18:51.820 --> 18:52.683
Got a better gig.

18:52.821 --> 18:54.443
We found Holland's body

18:54.581 --> 18:56.549
hidden
in the greenhouse yesterday.

18:56.687 --> 18:58.723
That's--
That's horrible.

18:58.861 --> 19:01.933
Before that, we found
the handyman... murdered.

19:02.071 --> 19:03.659
Leo?

19:03.797 --> 19:05.799
No. Jake. Um...

19:05.937 --> 19:07.456
Skip.

19:07.594 --> 19:09.389
I don't know
who that is.

19:09.527 --> 19:12.254
Look, I'm gonna put
our cards on the table.

19:12.392 --> 19:15.326
We got a warrant for
Holland's cellphone records.

19:15.464 --> 19:17.466
We have dozens
of texts from you,

19:17.604 --> 19:20.469
harassing her,
threatening her.

19:20.607 --> 19:25.233
And the M.E. found your DNA
under her fingernails.

19:25.371 --> 19:28.063
We are gonna arrest <i>you</i>
for murder.

19:34.138 --> 19:36.071
I'm so sorry.

19:42.319 --> 19:44.252
I didn't--
I didn't, uh...

19:44.390 --> 19:46.702
I didn't mean to kill her.
It just...

19:46.840 --> 19:47.600
It all got out of hand.

19:47.738 --> 19:49.153
I understand.

19:51.362 --> 19:54.262
But the best way to honor
her memory is to come clean.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.056
Tell us everything
that happened.

19:57.472 --> 19:59.059
Okay.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.785
Including what you did
to Jake.

20:00.923 --> 20:03.512
I told you,
I don't know that guy.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.100
I swear.

20:05.238 --> 20:08.207
You said
- he was murdered?
- Yes.

20:08.345 --> 20:11.520
After he vanished into thin air
at the Baudelaires' mansion.

20:11.658 --> 20:13.626
Did you check the...

20:13.764 --> 20:14.627
Check the what?

20:20.184 --> 20:21.737
Hey, guys. Wait.
Hold up.

20:29.952 --> 20:31.402
Sgt. Grey:
What do you got?

20:37.097 --> 20:38.306
Let's check it out.

20:38.444 --> 20:40.100
Be careful.

20:44.277 --> 20:45.727
Hey.
Stay back.

20:53.528 --> 20:55.599
Weird tunnel.

20:59.223 --> 21:00.086
Wow.

21:00.224 --> 21:02.053
What is this?

21:03.641 --> 21:05.333
It's dusty.

21:08.128 --> 21:11.511
Oof.

21:11.649 --> 21:13.341
- What is it?
- No way.

21:13.479 --> 21:14.514
Grey.

21:14.652 --> 21:15.619
Oh!

21:17.655 --> 21:18.622
What is it?

21:23.420 --> 21:24.766
You gotta be kidding me.

21:27.009 --> 21:29.702
Oh, my God.
It looks just like you.

21:33.153 --> 21:35.190
It's called "The Lost Emperor."

21:35.328 --> 21:37.710
Ferdinand had it for a while,

21:37.848 --> 21:40.609
but it went missing
after World War I.

21:40.747 --> 21:44.164
Rumor has it that Hitler had it
for a short stint,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.719
but it got looted
from the Fuehrerbunker.

21:46.857 --> 21:48.410
We believe it depicts

21:48.548 --> 21:51.793
the Haitian Revolution's
Battle of the Vertières,

21:51.931 --> 21:55.969
when the Haitian rebels defeated
the French in November 1803.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.041
The painting is one of
the generals--

21:59.179 --> 22:01.320
Gabart, Capois,

22:01.458 --> 22:04.150
possibly even
the great liberator

22:04.288 --> 22:06.739
Jean-Jacques Dessalines.

22:06.877 --> 22:08.465
Think George Washington.

22:08.603 --> 22:12.503
They say certain traits
are genetic--

22:12.641 --> 22:17.681
leadership, strength,
the ability to inspire people.

22:17.819 --> 22:19.096
I'm not aware of any connection

22:19.234 --> 22:20.580
between Dessalines
and my family,

22:20.718 --> 22:22.341
but, uh, well...

22:22.479 --> 22:24.204
I wouldn't be surprised.

22:26.310 --> 22:28.001
Why are you smiling?

22:28.139 --> 22:29.865
No reason. I just...

22:30.003 --> 22:32.696
Your reaction to the painting
has been pretty priceless.

22:36.907 --> 22:38.598
Go back to work.

22:52.405 --> 22:55.063
"Harlequin's Head"
by Picasso.

22:56.754 --> 22:59.688
Stalin's Bible.
Charles Manson's jockstrap.

22:59.826 --> 23:01.897
What is all this stuff?

23:02.035 --> 23:04.210
Stolen art, uh, antiques,

23:04.348 --> 23:06.971
and... cursed curiosities.

23:07.109 --> 23:10.147
All bought on the black market
by Charles and Camille.

23:10.285 --> 23:12.149
Yeah. They were all
worth a fortune.

23:12.287 --> 23:14.151
Which would explain
why they didn't tell us
about the hidden vault.

23:14.289 --> 23:16.981
But the most valuable thing
we found in that moment...

23:17.119 --> 23:18.397
I got something.

23:19.674 --> 23:20.640
...was the hatch.

23:29.477 --> 23:31.340
And that's how Dim got
out of the house.

23:31.479 --> 23:34.413
The ladder led up to
a hidden grate in the bushes.

23:34.551 --> 23:36.829
And from there, it was
a clear path with no cameras

23:36.967 --> 23:37.830
to get off the property.

23:37.968 --> 23:40.280
But one question remained--

23:40.419 --> 23:43.422
Where did Dim go,
and who killed him?

23:43.560 --> 23:45.769
Look alive, guys.
Here she comes.

23:49.635 --> 23:50.498
Thanks for meeting me.

23:50.636 --> 23:51.430
Of course.

23:55.054 --> 23:56.435
And you're okay
with the cameras?

23:57.643 --> 24:00.093
Oh, God. I guess.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.681
Um,
I'm a little confused

24:01.819 --> 24:04.960
as to why you're coming to me
and not the police.

24:05.098 --> 24:07.756
I don't trust them.

24:07.894 --> 24:09.862
If I showed them this,
they would find some way

24:10.000 --> 24:11.864
to use it against me.

24:12.002 --> 24:14.383
I'm not so sure about that,
but I'm happy to take a look.

24:14.522 --> 24:17.283
What exactly are you
gonna show me?

24:17.421 --> 24:19.388
It's a video.

24:19.527 --> 24:22.150
Two days before Jake
went missing, um...

24:22.288 --> 24:23.807
somebody tried
to kill us.

24:25.049 --> 24:26.775
Okay.

24:26.913 --> 24:28.018
<i>I love you, boo.</i>

24:28.156 --> 24:29.295
Mm.
Love you, baby.

24:29.433 --> 24:31.055
No, b-baby, you gotta say it
to the camera.

24:31.193 --> 24:32.298
Well, I'm driving, baby.

24:32.436 --> 24:33.299
Baby.
Alright.

24:33.437 --> 24:34.611
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

24:34.749 --> 24:35.888
I love you, baby.

24:37.579 --> 24:39.236
Damn!

24:39.374 --> 24:40.962
Who in the hell is that?

24:41.100 --> 24:42.446
Oh. Baby.
Baby, watch out.

24:42.584 --> 24:43.309
Watch out!

24:43.447 --> 24:44.621
God!

24:44.759 --> 24:46.139
Oh!

24:51.800 --> 24:53.733
Oh, God.

24:53.871 --> 24:54.734
Baby.
Yeah.

24:54.872 --> 24:55.908
We gots to go. Okay.

24:56.046 --> 24:56.978
Baby,
we got to go now!

24:57.116 --> 24:58.013
Okay! Okay! Okay!

25:02.639 --> 25:04.572
They didn't report it.
They just abandoned it.

25:04.710 --> 25:06.401
Well, we tracked down
the abandoned car,

25:06.539 --> 25:07.816
but the paint scrapings

25:07.954 --> 25:09.922
that we took
from the impact point

25:10.060 --> 25:13.339
showed the most common brand
of automotive paint.

25:13.477 --> 25:16.584
Which means we had added
another mystery to the case--

25:16.722 --> 25:18.102
Who was the driver?

25:18.240 --> 25:20.104
But that question
took a back seat.

25:20.242 --> 25:22.210
Oh,
because the text came.

25:22.348 --> 25:24.868
You have to show this
to the police.

25:35.292 --> 25:36.431
Geez.

25:36.569 --> 25:37.536
Stay with her.

25:40.849 --> 25:44.473
A text was sent from an unknown
number to Dim and Juicy,

25:44.612 --> 25:46.821
demanding the item
that had been promised.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.132
And the text
went on to threaten violence

25:48.270 --> 25:50.307
if Juicy didn't
turn the item over.

25:50.445 --> 25:53.862
It seemed likely that whomever
sent that text killed Dim.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.520
So it was time for me
to go undercover.

26:03.631 --> 26:05.218
You had no idea
what you were walking into.

26:05.356 --> 26:06.979
That's working undercover.

26:07.117 --> 26:08.636
Doesn't that scare you,
walking in by yourself?

26:08.774 --> 26:11.086
Th--
But I wasn't by myself.

26:15.712 --> 26:17.299
UC is in play.

26:36.318 --> 26:37.837
Heads up.
This could be our guy.

27:07.487 --> 27:08.592
Do you have it?

27:10.007 --> 27:12.044
Nope.

27:12.182 --> 27:14.218
What do you mean, no?

27:15.461 --> 27:16.980
Whatever you were into
with Jake,

27:17.118 --> 27:18.395
he didn't share it
with me.

27:18.533 --> 27:21.881
I got no idea who you are
or what you want.

27:22.019 --> 27:23.469
And now
that Jake is dead...

27:25.574 --> 27:28.543
That's not my problem.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.234
I need
what he promised...

27:31.891 --> 27:34.238
...or you're gonna learn
what battery acid tastes like.

27:36.102 --> 27:38.449
Is that what you said to Jake
before you killed him?

27:39.796 --> 27:41.729
Enough.
You're coming with me.

27:41.867 --> 27:42.661
Gun.
Move in.

27:44.697 --> 27:45.802
Don't move.

27:45.940 --> 27:46.665
- Copy that! Moving in!
- Get on the ground!

27:46.803 --> 27:48.183
Drop the gun!

27:48.321 --> 27:49.598
Get on the ground
right now!

27:49.737 --> 27:51.911
- Police! Don't move!
- Stay where you are!

27:52.049 --> 27:54.189
I got him on this side!

27:54.327 --> 27:57.089
- Don't move!
- Stay where you are!

27:57.227 --> 27:59.194
- Everybody freeze! Weapons down!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:59.332 --> 28:00.195
- Drop your weapon!
- Multiple targets!

28:00.333 --> 28:01.507
- Right there!
- Drop the gun!

28:01.645 --> 28:02.750
Whoa, whoa! Hey!
LAPD!

28:02.888 --> 28:03.958
Who the hell
are you guys?

28:04.096 --> 28:05.373
CIA.

28:11.413 --> 28:13.001
Thanks for taking
the time to speak with me.

28:13.139 --> 28:14.796
My pleasure.

28:14.934 --> 28:16.522
The agency is committed to
transparency wherever possible.

28:16.660 --> 28:18.248
Great. So, what can you tell me
about Emir Sadik?

28:18.386 --> 28:19.490
Nothing.

28:19.628 --> 28:21.285
Come on.

28:21.423 --> 28:23.771
It's common knowledge that
Mr. Sadik is a Turkish national

28:23.909 --> 28:25.462
who works
for Meyer Balik,

28:25.600 --> 28:26.877
an infamous international
arms dealer.

28:27.015 --> 28:29.535
I'm not prepared
to speak on that. Okay.

28:29.673 --> 28:31.537
Can you explain the connection
to Jake Butler?

28:31.675 --> 28:33.056
I'm not prepared
to speak on that.

28:34.885 --> 28:37.129
How about the mystery item that
Emir was so intent on getting

28:37.267 --> 28:38.717
from Mr. Butler
and Ms. Wu?

28:38.855 --> 28:40.960
I'm not prepared
to speak on that.

28:41.098 --> 28:43.066
Then why did you agree
to the interview?

28:43.204 --> 28:46.241
The agency is committed to
transparency wherever possible.

28:49.210 --> 28:52.627
It turns out Dim
and that arms dealer--

28:52.765 --> 28:53.973
Meyer Balik?

28:54.111 --> 28:56.079
Yeah.
That's the guy.

28:56.217 --> 28:59.323
Dim and Meyer
were distant cousins.

28:59.461 --> 29:02.671
I found out through
a back-channel source at the DOD

29:02.810 --> 29:05.053
that the, uh-- the agency
had been surveilling Emir

29:05.191 --> 29:08.091
for-- for months now,
while he and Meyer were working

29:08.229 --> 29:11.094
on a massive arms deal
for the Iranians.

29:11.232 --> 29:12.647
But during
the deal-making process,

29:12.785 --> 29:14.407
Emir went to Barbados.

29:14.545 --> 29:15.581
Where he met with Dim.

29:15.719 --> 29:17.652
But not Juicy?

29:17.790 --> 29:20.068
That's what she says.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.276
How you holding up?

29:23.313 --> 29:25.177
I'm heartbroken.

29:25.315 --> 29:27.662
I thought I knew him.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.526
I thought he loved me.

29:29.664 --> 29:32.253
To find out he had this whole
other life, I mean...

29:33.875 --> 29:35.704
I've been drunk
the whole week.

29:35.843 --> 29:37.672
So you had no idea
that the Baudelaires

29:37.810 --> 29:39.225
weren't just
a random target?

29:40.848 --> 29:43.195
Jake just said
they were crazy rich

29:43.333 --> 29:45.645
and that we'd be able
to party for a year

29:45.784 --> 29:47.786
off of what we'd get
out of their house.

29:47.924 --> 29:49.304
Well, what we now know

29:49.442 --> 29:52.204
is that Emir pointed Jake
at the Baudelaires.

29:52.342 --> 29:54.482
But it wasn't connected
to the Iranian arms deal

29:54.620 --> 29:56.553
that the CIA was
so keen to stop.

29:56.691 --> 29:58.451
It turns out, among
the stolen antiquities

29:58.589 --> 30:01.765
in the Baudelaires' vault
was a very special rifle.

30:01.903 --> 30:04.319
The miquelet,
one of the earliest

30:04.457 --> 30:07.219
and most sturdy flintlocks
ever made.

30:07.357 --> 30:10.118
And the most famous miquelet
belonged to the Turkish sultan

30:10.256 --> 30:13.812
Osman II,
or Osman the Young.

30:13.950 --> 30:14.985
I-I like to read.

30:15.123 --> 30:17.056
You sure do.

30:17.194 --> 30:18.747
But h-history lesson aside,

30:18.886 --> 30:22.579
as a proud Turk and a
professional weapon aficionado,

30:22.717 --> 30:26.755
Meyer Balik had been hunting for
the sultan's rifle for decades.

30:26.894 --> 30:29.897
And somehow, he discovered
that the Baudelaires had it.

30:30.035 --> 30:32.658
So he called up Cousin Jake

30:32.796 --> 30:35.454
and set up a meeting
with Emir in Barbados.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.637
I was probably getting a massage
at the time or a facial...

30:46.775 --> 30:48.191
or a seaweed wrap.

30:50.055 --> 30:51.539
Or body scrub.

30:53.644 --> 30:56.647
I spent most of that trip
just getting pampered, you know?

30:58.408 --> 31:00.099
Yeah, once we learned
about the rifle's existence,

31:00.237 --> 31:02.688
we quickly found the crate
it had been stored in.

31:14.424 --> 31:17.530
But the rifle was gone, which
meant that Dim had taken it,

31:17.668 --> 31:20.740
uh, before he had snuck out
of the Baudelaires' house.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.467
But he hadn't
- delivered it to Emir.
- No.

31:23.605 --> 31:24.952
Emir hadn't even landed
in the U.S.

31:25.090 --> 31:26.574
by the time Dim was killed.

31:26.712 --> 31:28.956
Which means Dim took it
somewhere else.

31:29.094 --> 31:30.958
Yeah.
Question was-- Where?

31:31.096 --> 31:32.373
To who-- whom?

31:32.511 --> 31:34.340
Yeah.
And what happened to it?

31:34.478 --> 31:35.686
You were about to find all that
out, though, weren't you?

31:35.824 --> 31:37.136
Yes.

31:37.274 --> 31:39.794
In the most
terrifying way.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.140
Drop the gun!

31:44.005 --> 31:45.800
Baby?
Baby, look out!

31:45.938 --> 31:46.801
Look out!

31:46.939 --> 31:48.561
Oh!

31:48.699 --> 31:50.770
With Emir out
of the picture as a suspect,

31:50.909 --> 31:52.496
we went back
to the car crash.

31:52.634 --> 31:55.810
Somebody tried to run
Jake and Sava off the road

31:55.948 --> 31:57.985
two days before Jake was killed.

31:58.123 --> 32:00.815
If it wasn't Emir, who was it?

32:00.953 --> 32:02.334
Well, we had previously

32:02.472 --> 32:03.991
gotten warrants
for Jake's phone records,

32:04.129 --> 32:05.785
but Sava told us

32:05.924 --> 32:08.340
that, uh, Jake always carried
a burner phone with him,

32:08.478 --> 32:09.617
and we didn't
have that number.

32:09.755 --> 32:10.652
Until the incident with Emir.

32:10.790 --> 32:12.240
Exactly.

32:12.378 --> 32:14.794
Even though the CIA kept us
from interrogating Emir,

32:14.933 --> 32:17.418
they did search
Emir's cellphone records

32:17.556 --> 32:19.523
and came up with
an anonymous number

32:19.661 --> 32:22.595
that we ultimately
tracked back to Dim.

32:22.733 --> 32:25.771
Let's just say that there were
several text messages

32:25.909 --> 32:29.361
sent to and from that phone
that were very... revealing.

32:29.499 --> 32:31.087
I...Interviewer:
What do you mean?

32:31.225 --> 32:34.366
Jake was clearly cheating
on Sava,

32:34.504 --> 32:37.748
and he was
the Shakespeare of Sexting.

32:37.886 --> 32:39.612
It was

32:39.750 --> 32:41.683
Would you read some
of those texts for me?

32:48.414 --> 32:50.140
Yeah. You-- Uh, no.
I can't. I'm sorry.

32:50.278 --> 32:51.210
I can't say any of this
on camera.

32:51.348 --> 32:52.729
My nana is gonna watch this.

32:52.867 --> 32:53.592
Oh.
You can--
Yeah. Sorry.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.629
Can you read some
of these texts to me?

32:56.767 --> 32:58.148
Are you kidding me?
Put that away.

32:58.286 --> 32:59.391
No. You couldn't get Lucy
to read them.

32:59.529 --> 33:01.807
What makes you think
I'm gonna read 'em?

33:01.945 --> 33:02.981
I'm serious. Okay.

33:03.119 --> 33:04.672
- I'm not reading them.
- Okay.

33:04.810 --> 33:07.364
Would you mind
reading some of these texts

33:07.502 --> 33:08.572
out loud?

33:11.127 --> 33:12.749
Um...

33:12.887 --> 33:14.475
I can't say that.

33:14.613 --> 33:16.856
I'm not saying that.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.582
I have no idea
what that even means.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.584
Let me just find some
PG content for you.

33:20.722 --> 33:22.241
Oh.
Here we go.

33:22.379 --> 33:25.831
"Stop calling.
I told you it's over."

33:25.969 --> 33:27.419
The breakup text.

33:27.557 --> 33:30.422
It was the, uh,
proverbial smoking gun.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.597
The text that would determine
Dim's fate.

33:33.735 --> 33:36.773
And just for clarity-- who was
Dim sending these texts to?

33:36.911 --> 33:38.982
Who was he having
an affair with?

33:39.120 --> 33:40.708
Uh, Lisa...
Lisa Miller.

33:40.846 --> 33:41.847
Li-- Miller?
Lisa Miller?

33:41.985 --> 33:43.607
That's Juicy's BFF.

33:43.745 --> 33:45.161
So, what are we doing here?

33:45.299 --> 33:46.334
Girl, you know
what we're doing.

33:46.472 --> 33:47.577
No.

33:47.715 --> 33:49.510
For, like, posperiority.

33:49.648 --> 33:51.581
I think it's "posterity."

33:51.719 --> 33:52.996
Mnh-mnh.

33:53.134 --> 33:54.170
That don't sound right, girl.

33:54.308 --> 33:55.723
Okay. So...

33:57.207 --> 33:59.175
I'm waiting for Jake
to get out of prison.
Mm-hmm.

33:59.313 --> 34:01.039
He just did six months
on a drug charge,

34:01.177 --> 34:03.110
and I found out today
he's getting released early.

34:03.248 --> 34:04.352
Ooh.
For good behavior?

34:04.490 --> 34:05.560
Girl. Overcrowding.

34:07.735 --> 34:08.943
Baby!

34:09.081 --> 34:10.979
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

34:12.429 --> 34:14.569
Mmm!
Mmm.

34:14.707 --> 34:16.019
Baby.
Oh, I missed you.

34:16.157 --> 34:17.055
Yeah.
I missed you, too.

34:17.193 --> 34:18.849
Yo, Lisa!

34:19.988 --> 34:21.749
Hey!

34:21.887 --> 34:24.959
At that point, it all started
coming together.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.581
Lisa couldn't handle the fact

34:26.719 --> 34:28.031
that Jake was breaking up
with her,

34:28.169 --> 34:29.964
so she tried to run them
off the road.

34:30.102 --> 34:31.586
- Look out!
- And when that failed,

34:31.724 --> 34:33.864
she called up Jake,
begged for his forgiveness,

34:34.002 --> 34:35.625
and asked him to meet her.

34:35.763 --> 34:37.144
Yeah, when he showed up,

34:37.282 --> 34:39.767
she shot him
with a .22-caliber pistol,

34:39.905 --> 34:41.872
then dumped his body
in the dumpster.

34:42.010 --> 34:43.564
So, we went to arrest her.

34:43.702 --> 34:45.152
I think that's her.

35:04.550 --> 35:06.690
Police!
Show me your hands!

35:06.828 --> 35:08.175
Move in on her!
Move in!

35:08.313 --> 35:09.176
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Drop the gun!

35:09.314 --> 35:10.694
Down!

35:10.832 --> 35:11.937
Shots fired! Shots fired!

35:12.075 --> 35:13.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Drop the gun!

35:13.594 --> 35:14.767
- Oh, John!
- Get in there.

35:16.079 --> 35:17.425
Officer down.

35:17.563 --> 35:20.359
We need an R.A.--
Flower and Lincoln.

35:20.497 --> 35:21.464
John.

35:24.052 --> 35:26.054
Oh, my God.
I'm just...

35:26.193 --> 35:28.574
I'm-- Roll me back.
Roll me back.

35:30.818 --> 35:33.131
Let me catch my breath.

35:33.269 --> 35:34.477
I'm good.

35:39.171 --> 35:41.208
The thing
about old guns is

35:41.346 --> 35:42.554
that they're
very imprecise weapons,

35:42.692 --> 35:44.072
and the muzzle velocity
was significantly less

35:44.211 --> 35:47.006
than even the most modern,
smallest handgun.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.733
Translation-- There is no way
that the miquelet bullet

35:49.871 --> 35:51.563
could have punched a hole
in Nolan's bulletproof vest.

35:51.701 --> 35:54.566
He's just lucky she didn't
shoot him in the face.

35:54.704 --> 35:56.568
Uh, not getting shot in
the face-- that's a daily goal.

35:56.706 --> 35:58.052
Yeah, it's true.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.053
The first thing
he taught me was

35:59.191 --> 36:00.986
don't get
shot in the face.

36:01.124 --> 36:02.919
All things considered, though,
I do-- I got very lucky.

36:03.057 --> 36:05.232
Yeah. It could have been
so much worse.

36:05.370 --> 36:07.337
Yeah. Like it was
for Sergeant Grey.

36:08.649 --> 36:11.617
He's probably not gonna love
that you said...

36:11.755 --> 36:14.862
This painting captures
a moment in world history

36:15.000 --> 36:17.934
where freedom won out
over oppression,

36:18.072 --> 36:20.316
which is why its recovery
is so important.

36:20.454 --> 36:24.699
It is my honor to present
"The Lost Emperor."

36:30.395 --> 36:31.430
Climate change!

36:31.568 --> 36:33.260
- No!
- Oh, my God!

36:33.398 --> 36:34.916
No!

36:35.054 --> 36:36.435
You bastard!

36:36.573 --> 36:37.747
How could you?!

36:37.885 --> 36:40.508
You son of a

36:40.646 --> 36:42.614
Shame on you!

36:42.752 --> 36:44.443
Shame on you!

36:44.581 --> 36:45.824
Let me go!

36:45.962 --> 36:47.929
Get off me!

36:48.067 --> 36:49.862
Polar bears are people, too!

36:50.000 --> 36:51.933
This was an assassination.

36:52.071 --> 36:54.004
I'm sorry.
I need a minute.

36:54.142 --> 36:56.110
I just...

36:59.044 --> 37:01.011
At least I still have this.

37:07.052 --> 37:09.399
Sorry, Sergeant.
You're needed in the bullpen.

37:11.781 --> 37:13.092
What the hell is this about?

37:22.619 --> 37:24.345
What do we have here?

37:24.483 --> 37:26.485
Well, we all know how much
you love that painting.

37:26.623 --> 37:29.557
Unfortunately, it was
completely destroyed.

37:29.695 --> 37:31.663
So, we had
another painting made.

37:38.463 --> 37:39.981
It reflects the way
that we see you.

37:40.119 --> 37:42.121
With my shirt off?

37:42.260 --> 37:45.055
As a dragon slayer.

37:46.781 --> 37:48.058
Um...

37:50.233 --> 37:51.510
I love it.
I love it.

37:51.648 --> 37:52.511
Yay!

37:56.481 --> 37:59.380
Well, uh, so Lisa was going
to prison

37:59.518 --> 38:01.865
for the murder of Jake and
the attempted murder of Nolan.

38:02.003 --> 38:03.246
But we were left
with the question

38:03.384 --> 38:05.524
of what to do with Juicy.

38:05.662 --> 38:08.527
At the end of the day, it didn't
make sense to charge her.

38:08.665 --> 38:10.218
We could prove
Dim's involvement,

38:10.357 --> 38:13.221
but all we really had
on Juicy was conspiracy.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.809
D.A.'s office debated
for a while,

38:14.947 --> 38:17.709
but ultimately,
we decided to cut her loose.

38:17.847 --> 38:19.055
How did you feel about that?

38:20.332 --> 38:21.782
On the whole...

38:21.920 --> 38:23.784
good.

38:23.922 --> 38:25.820
Whatever her faults, Juicy...

38:27.132 --> 38:30.825
Sava had suffered
a great tragedy--

38:30.963 --> 38:34.415
betrayal, murder.

38:34.553 --> 38:37.245
I'm hopeful that she'll take
this opportunity

38:37.384 --> 38:39.317
to learn
from the experience, you know,

38:39.455 --> 38:40.559
to change.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.907
Of course she said that.

38:44.045 --> 38:45.564
Listen.
People never change, okay?

38:45.702 --> 38:48.740
Sava is gonna end up in cuffs,

39:56.428 --> 39:58.223
You're working
too hard.

39:58.361 --> 39:59.880
Okay, l--

40:00.018 --> 40:01.329
I get it, alright?

40:01.468 --> 40:02.641
You're invested
in a certain answer

40:02.779 --> 40:04.471
because it makes
for a better documentary.

40:04.609 --> 40:08.820
But we are not
Jake and Sava, okay?

40:08.958 --> 40:10.269
I mean, they--
they are criminals

40:10.408 --> 40:12.513
whose lives
were based on deceit.

40:12.651 --> 40:15.309
O-Of course that duplicity
infected their relationship.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.931
But...

40:17.069 --> 40:18.554
we are in a very
different place.

40:18.692 --> 40:19.934
Mm-hmm.

40:20.072 --> 40:21.211
And what place is that?

40:23.317 --> 40:25.940
If you don't know, then you
haven't been paying attention.

40:26.078 --> 40:27.597
I mean...

40:27.735 --> 40:31.808
Okay. So, a place
of honesty, respect, love.

40:31.946 --> 40:34.017
Yeah. I mean, those are--
those are good words. Yeah.

40:34.155 --> 40:35.709
But do those qualities guarantee

40:35.847 --> 40:38.194
that your relationship will
succeed where theirs failed?

40:38.332 --> 40:39.575
Oh, w--
Well, you--Okay, you know what?

40:39.713 --> 40:41.197
Of-- Of course not.

40:41.335 --> 40:43.026
But at this moment,
I mean,

40:43.164 --> 40:46.133
Tim and I are in
a really beautiful place.

40:46.271 --> 40:48.446
And that's all
that matters.

40:48.584 --> 40:50.551
Yeah.

40:50.689 --> 40:53.140
Look, the thing you learn early
on as police officers

40:53.278 --> 40:56.384
is that your future
is never certain.

40:56.523 --> 40:59.491
Yeah. Anything can happen
to anyone at any time.

40:59.629 --> 41:01.700
Especially if they overstay
their welcome.

41:05.117 --> 41:06.705
Uh-- Oh.
Oh, does that mean...

41:06.843 --> 41:07.810
Yeah, we're--
Yeah. We're done.

41:07.948 --> 41:08.742
Sorry.
That's right.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.157
Sorry, guys.

41:11.917 --> 41:13.436
Do you want to get sushi?

41:13.574 --> 41:14.541
Oh, that's perfect.

41:14.679 --> 41:15.887
Okay.
Listen.

41:16.025 --> 41:17.198
We're gonna be back
in an hour.

41:17.336 --> 41:18.372
Place better be spotless.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.373
Oh, God.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.650
Yes, sir.

41:20.788 --> 41:21.651
Thank you.

41:21.789 --> 41:22.997
Yeah. Thank you.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.485
Okay.
Let's pack it up.

41:27.623 --> 41:29.176
You don't think he's
really mad at me, do you?
