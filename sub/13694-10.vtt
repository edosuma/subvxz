WEBVTT

00:17.145 --> 00:18.813
(EXCLAIMS) Golly!

00:20.398 --> 00:22.358
Isn't it a little bit early
for a shooting party?

00:22.442 --> 00:26.571
Molly, your front door
was open. You have
an intruder in the house.

00:26.654 --> 00:28.031
-What?
-Shh!

00:35.538 --> 00:37.540
(GIGGLING AT A DISTANCE)

00:38.750 --> 00:39.959
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:43.629 --> 00:45.048
(SIGHS)

00:45.131 --> 00:47.467
-What's going on here then?
-We are talking. That's all!

00:47.550 --> 00:49.969
At this time at night,
I thought you were at home.

00:50.053 --> 00:51.929
This a party?
Where's the nibbles?

00:52.013 --> 00:53.973
Shh-shh!
(WHISPERING) All of you!

00:55.933 --> 00:58.061
There's someone downstairs.

01:01.064 --> 01:03.941
-MOLLY: Can I get you a plate?
-Paul, call the police.

01:04.025 --> 01:05.485
Oh, no, wait a minute.

01:05.568 --> 01:07.195
I'm here to see
my wee girl Ali.

01:07.278 --> 01:08.404
I didn't want to wake
anybody up.

01:08.488 --> 01:09.697
There's no one here
called Ali.

01:12.742 --> 01:14.285
Hello, darlin'!

01:15.620 --> 01:17.872
GOLLY: Lexie,

01:17.955 --> 01:20.041
is this your father,
or do we call the police?

01:21.668 --> 01:23.920
Yeah. Yeah, that's my father.

01:26.422 --> 01:27.965
And yeah,

01:28.049 --> 01:29.676
call the police.

02:06.212 --> 02:08.756
London, Moscow, Nairobi...

02:08.840 --> 02:12.677
I had a dot-com business
in Silicon Valley before
the bubble burst.

02:12.759 --> 02:15.722
Piloted flying boats off
the great barrier reef.

02:15.805 --> 02:19.142
Last couple of years,
I've been chartering yachts
out of Glasgow.

02:19.225 --> 02:20.852
But you walked up here?

02:20.935 --> 02:24.397
I get the urge sometimes.
I'm a peripatetic sort of guy.

02:24.480 --> 02:26.441
Peri-pathetic, you mean.

02:26.524 --> 02:28.109
ALEX: I've known you were here
for ages, sweetheart.

02:28.192 --> 02:31.403
-Just didn't want to intrude
on your happiness...
-But here you are!

02:31.487 --> 02:34.198
I thought it might be time.

02:34.282 --> 02:36.075
Finish that, and Golly
will show you to the gate.

02:36.159 --> 02:39.412
-Ali!
-Thanks for dropping by.
See you in another 20 years!

02:43.332 --> 02:45.585
You did rather take her
by surprise.

02:45.668 --> 02:47.754
You know, designer stubble
is not really me.

02:48.921 --> 02:50.548
Any chance I could
borrow a razor?

02:54.302 --> 02:56.054
I can't believe you were
sneaking around after...

02:56.137 --> 02:58.097
Excuse me, but I was not
the one sneaking around!

02:58.181 --> 03:00.850
-Dad! We were just talking!
-Aye, so you say.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.977
Well, in future I want you
home by 11:00,

03:03.061 --> 03:05.021
and if you are going out,
I want to know
where you're going.

03:05.104 --> 03:06.939
I'm 22 years old!

03:07.023 --> 03:08.733
Glenbogle is an old-fashioned
sort of place.

03:08.816 --> 03:10.735
Once you get a reputation
around here, that's it!

03:10.818 --> 03:13.738
-Please!
-All right?

03:13.821 --> 03:15.740
And I'm disappointed
in you, Duncan.

03:17.241 --> 03:19.369
Is it Jess having a boyfriend
you object to,

03:19.452 --> 03:20.953
or Jess having me
for a boyfriend?

03:21.037 --> 03:23.664
Relationships at work
are a bad idea.

03:23.748 --> 03:25.708
They're unprofessional
and they cause complications.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.919
I thought it was my reputation
you were worried about.

03:28.002 --> 03:30.546
You two just better finish
this right now,

03:30.630 --> 03:33.091
-before it gets serious.
-Or what?

03:33.174 --> 03:34.967
GOLLY: Or you can go back
to your mother's.

03:35.051 --> 03:37.970
You live under my roof,
you live by my rules.
Simple as that!

03:44.393 --> 03:46.813
Oh, Amanda. You're here early.

03:48.022 --> 03:49.273
Actually, I never left.

03:50.149 --> 03:52.944
Ooh, I see.

03:53.027 --> 03:54.320
I hope that's all right
with you.

03:54.404 --> 03:57.365
Yeah, well, Paul's a grown-up,
allegedly.

03:57.448 --> 03:59.742
Anyway, it's open house
around here.

03:59.826 --> 04:02.870
-Ah, yes, I missed
your father.
-LEXIE: More than I did.

04:02.954 --> 04:05.790
How did you feel? Seeing him
again after all this time.

04:05.873 --> 04:09.293
You're um, chief executive
of the distillery.

04:09.377 --> 04:11.838
Shouldn't you be away
executing somebody?

04:14.090 --> 04:16.551
I'll go and polish my axe.
See ya.

04:19.971 --> 04:22.432
These are fine boots!

04:22.515 --> 04:25.976
-They yours?
-Well, I used to ride when
the children were little.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.936
-What happened?
-(INHALES)

04:28.021 --> 04:30.356
Well after a few years we
couldn't afford to keep
the horses,

04:30.440 --> 04:33.609
so the nearest I got
was a flutter on the gee-gees.

04:33.693 --> 04:35.862
Couldn't really afford
that either.

04:35.945 --> 04:39.782
-Do you ride?
-Came second
in the '93 Grand National.

04:39.866 --> 04:42.910
I thought that race
was declared void.

04:42.994 --> 04:46.205
(EXHALES) Story of my life.

04:46.289 --> 04:49.250
-Now, that is a distinct
improvement!
-(CHUCKLES)

04:49.334 --> 04:51.461
Must thank the laird,
if I ever get a chance
to meet him.

04:51.544 --> 04:54.672
We he usually rings once
a week, but we haven't heard
from him for a while.

04:54.756 --> 04:56.632
ALEX: All the things
you want to say to them, eh?

04:56.716 --> 04:59.927
You can never find the words
at the moment,
then it's too late.

05:00.011 --> 05:01.220
Don't worry,

05:01.304 --> 05:03.639
Lexie'll come round.
Give her time.

05:03.722 --> 05:05.516
Time's the one thing
I don't have.

05:06.768 --> 05:09.187
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:09.270 --> 05:11.689
-Why is he still here?
-Lexie, don't be too hasty.

05:12.231 --> 05:13.316
Your father...

05:14.692 --> 05:16.527
Your father might not
be with us very long.

05:18.404 --> 05:20.740
I cannot believe you told
Molly you were dying!

05:20.823 --> 05:23.201
I never actually said that.

05:23.284 --> 05:25.870
-Ali... Look...
-Don't call me that!

05:25.953 --> 05:28.456
I'm sure your mother said
lots of things about me,

05:28.539 --> 05:30.958
I'm lazy, unreliable,
I could never stick
at anything...

05:31.042 --> 05:32.794
I know my mother was no saint,

05:32.877 --> 05:35.004
but what did I ever do to you?

05:35.088 --> 05:38.341
You walked out on me
and I was six years old!

05:38.424 --> 05:39.634
-Seven.
-(SCOFFS)

05:39.717 --> 05:41.844
You really want to haggle
about this?

05:41.928 --> 05:43.554
Ali, I need your help.

05:43.638 --> 05:45.014
I was trying to expand
my business,

05:45.098 --> 05:47.183
I took on some partners
without checking them out.

05:47.266 --> 05:48.893
And they didn't bother
to check you out?

05:48.976 --> 05:51.854
-Turns out they're
Russian Mafia.
-(CHUCKLES)

05:51.938 --> 05:53.690
Russian? Yeah, of course!

05:53.772 --> 05:55.900
-Well, they think I owe
them ten grand!
-Ah!

05:55.983 --> 05:58.194
-Here we go...
-I not looking for money,

05:58.277 --> 06:00.780
I just need some
place to stay.
They'd never find me here.

06:00.863 --> 06:02.323
You're right! They won't!

06:03.491 --> 06:04.951
-Ali...
-Alex!

06:05.034 --> 06:07.870
You're about 20 years too late
with the fairy stories.

06:16.546 --> 06:19.090
I mean where does he get off
to tell me who to go off with?

06:19.173 --> 06:21.384
Next thing, he's gonna be
checking my wardrobe
for tight skirts

06:21.467 --> 06:23.219
and confiscating my make-up!

06:23.302 --> 06:25.638
So long. Nice to meet you.

06:25.722 --> 06:28.725
Aye. Uh, the road
out's that way.

06:28.808 --> 06:30.852
Is it? No sense of direction.

06:30.935 --> 06:32.311
JESS: You're Lexie's dad.

06:32.395 --> 06:34.230
Don't let her hear you
say that.

06:34.313 --> 06:36.733
You not about to start telling
her who she can go out with,
are you?

06:36.816 --> 06:39.610
Any sort of man at all,
you want to stop your kids
getting hurt.

06:39.694 --> 06:40.945
That never goes away.

06:44.866 --> 06:46.784
Who's that chap
wandering your gardens?

06:50.496 --> 06:53.374
-Ah, I don't believe it!
-DOROTHY: He's rather
striking.

06:53.458 --> 06:55.585
LEXIE: He's a convict
on day release!

06:55.668 --> 06:58.379
We used him for
shooting practice,
out of season.

06:58.463 --> 06:59.881
Really?

06:59.964 --> 07:01.924
(CLICKS TONGUE) I'm just
gonna go get my gun.

07:02.008 --> 07:05.428
But, before you do, I wondered
if you could recommend
a good chauffeur?

07:05.511 --> 07:08.181
-But, what happened to Hamish?
-Well, I had to let him go.

07:08.264 --> 07:11.975
He simply refused to wax
the car more than twice
a week.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.187
And I thought the Scots
had a strong work ethic.

07:14.270 --> 07:18.024
When I find someone with
a work ethic
as strong as yours,

07:18.107 --> 07:20.151
I'll be sure to send
them along.

07:20.234 --> 07:22.779
Oh, I say...

07:22.862 --> 07:25.948
-Isn't that Amanda McLeish
with your brother-in-law?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:26.032 --> 07:27.658
Quelle scandale!

07:28.826 --> 07:30.036
DOROTHY: Didn't you know?

07:30.119 --> 07:31.913
Amanda McLeish is married.

07:31.996 --> 07:33.456
To a businessman
twice her age,

07:33.539 --> 07:35.708
who spends most of his time
in the south of France.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.549
Oh, Alex, still hanging on,
I see!

07:45.051 --> 07:47.804
I was just admiring
the gardens.

07:47.887 --> 07:50.223
I was head gardener
at Ashford Castle
for a few years.

07:50.682 --> 07:52.266
Really?

07:52.350 --> 07:54.227
Oh, well, um...

07:54.310 --> 07:56.854
I wonder if you could
tell me...

07:56.938 --> 08:00.441
What this tree is called?
I can't seem to find it
in any book.

08:01.401 --> 08:03.194
Acer palmatum. Japanese maple.

08:04.445 --> 08:05.571
But you knew that already.

08:07.949 --> 08:11.619
So, I was under the impression
that you came to make
your peace with Lexie.

08:11.703 --> 08:12.787
I did but,

08:13.913 --> 08:16.791
I mean I didn't,
to start with.

08:16.874 --> 08:19.794
After I saw her, I realised
she's the only thing
that matters, and,

08:19.877 --> 08:21.045
I have to make it up with her.

08:23.006 --> 08:25.717
See, when I do tell the truth,
no-one believes me.

08:26.551 --> 08:27.760
GOLLY: Molly?

08:27.844 --> 08:30.430
-Were you looking for me?
-Yes.

08:30.513 --> 08:32.765
Alex and I were talking
about riding and I...

08:32.849 --> 08:35.476
Well, suddenly realised
how much I missed it.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.270
Now, you won't believe this,

08:37.352 --> 08:38.730
but I want to buy a horse

08:38.813 --> 08:42.275
Oh, I'm sorry, Molly,
but I'm completely
out of horses.

08:42.357 --> 08:45.069
The McDougal livery
up in Oglemore have
a mare for sale.

08:45.153 --> 08:47.405
It's obviously meant to be!

08:47.488 --> 08:49.490
Oh, well, could you drive me
up there?

08:49.574 --> 08:53.077
Oh, I don't know about that!
I think I might have to
consult my diary.

08:53.161 --> 08:55.371
(GIGGLES)

08:55.455 --> 08:57.373
(CLICKS TONGUE) I can give
you a lift to the village.

08:57.457 --> 08:58.791
Oh, I don't want
to put you out.

08:58.874 --> 09:01.627
You won't. You can give
me hand a with the horsebox.

09:08.092 --> 09:11.095
I worked as a butler
for a Spanish countess
for a while.

09:11.929 --> 09:13.556
A lovely woman!

09:13.639 --> 09:15.350
Husband got killed
in the bullring.

09:17.477 --> 09:18.895
Anyway,

09:18.978 --> 09:20.813
we were very close...

09:22.023 --> 09:25.401
-But?
-We each had our own place.

09:25.485 --> 09:28.780
It wasn't till we left
the castile and got away
from old associations

09:28.863 --> 09:30.740
we could be ourselves.

09:30.823 --> 09:32.658
Why are you not
sullying yourself in Spain

09:32.742 --> 09:36.371
instead of shovelling horse
manure here in Scotland?

09:36.454 --> 09:38.373
She wanted kids.

09:38.456 --> 09:40.667
I've never been
big on the dad thing.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.836
I've not won too many
medals there myself.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.963
They get so angry with you.
They blame you for everything

09:46.047 --> 09:47.882
that's ever gone wrong
in their lives.

09:47.965 --> 09:50.510
-Sometimes with
very good reason.
-Hey,

09:50.593 --> 09:52.095
I know I've screwed up,

09:52.178 --> 09:54.055
but what's the good
in holding on to the pain?

09:54.138 --> 09:56.891
Is it not better to face
the truth and get past it?

09:56.974 --> 09:59.686
How are me and Ali gonna do
that if she won't even see me?

10:08.861 --> 10:11.322
-Where are you going?
-Well, it's not
the launderette.

10:11.406 --> 10:13.366
Oh, please, just because
I asked you
to behave yourself?

10:13.449 --> 10:15.326
Ach, no, Dad. Don't start.

10:15.410 --> 10:17.995
Thank you very much
for putting me up.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

10:18.079 --> 10:19.997
(MUMBLING)

10:20.081 --> 10:22.542
That's you away back
to your mother's, then?

10:22.625 --> 10:25.086
No, I'm going to stay
in the big house.

10:25.169 --> 10:27.630
-Says who?
-Says Lexie.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.091
She doesn't think
I'm a 12 year old. Excuse me.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.306
-(GIGGLES)
-No peeking, mind!

10:37.390 --> 10:38.599
Right, another two steps!

10:38.683 --> 10:40.351
Right, another one.
Mind the, um,

10:41.102 --> 10:43.062
I mean, ta-da!

10:50.194 --> 10:53.865
I uh, got the idea
from you, actually.

10:53.948 --> 10:57.160
I wanted to go for
the "Turkish boudoir" look.

10:58.202 --> 10:59.996
Sumptuous and yet...

11:00.747 --> 11:02.165
Understated.

11:10.673 --> 11:12.300
Hmm?

11:12.383 --> 11:15.178
DUNCAN: Do you like
the curtains?

11:15.261 --> 11:18.014
-Oh, here, let me unpack
for you...
-No, no, Duncan. It's fine.

11:18.097 --> 11:20.558
-Flowers! I meant to get
you flowers.
-Duncan, I don't need any...

11:20.641 --> 11:21.893
Flowers.

11:24.645 --> 11:26.064
What I really need

11:27.023 --> 11:28.024
is a flamethrower.

to riding again.
You should try it, Lexie!

11:37.658 --> 11:39.118
No, I think I'll stick
to my bike.

11:39.202 --> 11:41.245
Not quite as romantic,
but at least they don't bite.

11:41.329 --> 11:44.332
-We may be back late.
-It's fine. I'll expect you
when I see you.

11:44.415 --> 11:46.042
Good! Thank you.

11:48.961 --> 11:50.797
So, is he away?

11:50.880 --> 11:52.965
-Who?
-That man.

11:53.049 --> 11:56.386
-My "father".
-He's staying with me.

11:56.469 --> 11:58.221
-Golly!
-Well, seeing as how
you're looking after

11:58.304 --> 12:01.182
one of my relatives,
I thought, I'll do the same
for you.

12:01.265 --> 12:03.893
(SIGHS) Look, you and Jess
need to work out
your own problems.

12:03.976 --> 12:05.687
Yeah, that's right.

12:05.770 --> 12:08.064
And you need to sort
your problems out
with your dad.

12:08.147 --> 12:10.525
Me and that man
have nothing to sort out.

12:10.608 --> 12:11.693
Ah, Lexie!

12:13.444 --> 12:16.030
I tell you it is not easy
being a dad.

12:16.114 --> 12:19.158
Try to make up for
your mistakes and it gets
chucked back in your face.

12:20.743 --> 12:23.121
Why don't you just try
giving the guy a break?

12:29.168 --> 12:31.295
MOLLY: She's gorgeous.

12:31.379 --> 12:33.548
She's a fine animal,
right enough.

12:33.631 --> 12:34.674
EDITH: Hello!

12:35.842 --> 12:37.927
-And who might you be?
-Oh, uh,

12:38.011 --> 12:40.221
Mrs McDougal? I'm Molly.

12:40.304 --> 12:43.641
-Hello.
-I saw your advertisement
for the grey mare.

12:43.725 --> 12:47.145
-I did try to telephone...
-Oh, I don't answer
a telephone.

12:47.228 --> 12:48.855
It's the devil's instrument.

12:48.938 --> 12:51.858
EDITH: I prefer to look
people in the eye.

12:51.941 --> 12:53.401
-Is this the horse?
-Mmm-hmm.

12:53.484 --> 12:55.945
Had a couple here this morning
wanting to buy her,

12:56.029 --> 12:57.739
but I soon sent them packing.

12:57.822 --> 12:58.906
Really?

12:58.990 --> 13:01.451
I want my horses to go
to good homes.

13:01.534 --> 13:03.161
Respectable homes.

13:03.244 --> 13:04.746
Well, we're
vaguely respectable!

13:04.829 --> 13:07.331
These people weren't
even married.

13:07.415 --> 13:10.168
And flaunted it, shamelessly!

13:10.251 --> 13:11.669
EDITH: So, you'll be
her husband?

13:12.670 --> 13:15.256
Yes! Yes, he is.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.966
Golly Mackenzie.

13:17.050 --> 13:19.761
Well, Mrs Mackenzie,
would you like to...

13:19.844 --> 13:22.180
-Saddle her up?
-Oh, please!

13:22.263 --> 13:23.848
Come on then,
we'll get the tack.

13:25.433 --> 13:27.477
After you, Mrs Mackenzie.

13:30.688 --> 13:33.775
ALEX: A convict on
day release?

13:33.858 --> 13:35.902
That daughter of mine
and her stories!

13:35.985 --> 13:39.405
(DOROTHY CHUCKLES) I knew
she was pulling my leg,
of course.

13:39.489 --> 13:41.115
She must get it
from her mother.

13:41.199 --> 13:43.242
So, you've never actually
been in prison?

13:44.619 --> 13:46.996
To be absolutely
honest, Lady Dorothy,

13:47.080 --> 13:50.333
I did serve two years
for assault after I put
two men in a coma.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.085
Really?

13:52.168 --> 13:55.171
Suffice to say it concerned
a lady's honour.

13:55.254 --> 13:57.590
Never worked for the Royals
again, after that.

13:57.674 --> 13:58.883
You've worked for
the Royal family?

13:58.966 --> 14:00.593
I'm not allowed
to discuss it, I'm afraid.

14:00.677 --> 14:02.095
In what capacity?

14:02.178 --> 14:04.222
Chauffeur, cook and bodyguard.

14:04.305 --> 14:07.308
These hands are registered
as deadly weapons.

14:07.392 --> 14:09.560
Oh, yes.

14:09.644 --> 14:12.021
I do like a man who knows
how to use his hands.

14:26.703 --> 14:29.080
Well, Mrs Mackenzie,
what did you think?

14:29.163 --> 14:32.917
Ah! Allainn's a
beautiful horse.

14:33.001 --> 14:34.460
How much do you want for her?

14:34.544 --> 14:38.423
Oh, now we can talk about that
as soon as I've finished here.

14:38.506 --> 14:40.091
Are you sure you can manage?

14:40.174 --> 14:43.386
Oh, I have to! You see,
my last hand's retired

14:43.469 --> 14:46.889
and that useless son
of mine is 7,000 miles away!

14:46.973 --> 14:49.517
Easy! Up. Let me get that.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.854
We can't stand here
and let you do it
all by yourself!

14:52.937 --> 14:54.397
You're very kind.

14:57.025 --> 14:59.360
(CHUCKLES) Room service.

14:59.444 --> 15:00.945
I brought you some sandwiches.

15:01.029 --> 15:03.906
Duncan, I really fancied
some fresh air.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.783
What's happened to all these?

15:05.867 --> 15:09.495
Well, um, either they sleep
on the floor, or I do.

15:09.579 --> 15:12.832
You do like all this,
don't you? I mean,
all the soft toys and that?

15:12.915 --> 15:15.084
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you know, I do like them.

15:15.168 --> 15:18.546
Good, because I was going to
get you some more
for your birthday.

15:18.629 --> 15:21.632
-My birthday?
-Damn it!

15:21.716 --> 15:23.551
That was meant to be
a surprise.

15:23.634 --> 15:25.928
No, really, Duncan,
don't bother.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.598
You have done so much.

15:28.681 --> 15:31.059
(CHUCKLING) Oh.
It's no bother.

15:34.103 --> 15:35.605
Right, now,

15:35.688 --> 15:36.898
where are we gonna eat these?

15:39.692 --> 15:41.444
Ah, Amanda. Hi.

15:42.612 --> 15:44.405
Ran out of people to execute.

15:44.489 --> 15:46.657
So you thought you'd just
come back here.

15:46.741 --> 15:48.868
Do you have a problem with
me being here?

15:48.951 --> 15:51.996
-LEXIE: No, no, not at all.
-Good.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.539
But I think your
husband might.

15:57.001 --> 15:59.003
We are pretty cut off
here at Glenbogle,

15:59.087 --> 16:02.632
but the odd carrier pigeon
does get through
now and again.

16:05.093 --> 16:06.594
I suppose you're shocked,
are you?

16:08.262 --> 16:10.890
No, I'm just surprised
that Paul's never
mentioned it.

16:15.144 --> 16:17.021
PAUL: Hi there.

16:17.105 --> 16:20.274
Oh! Is this a handbag and
shoes thing, or can
anyone join in?

16:20.358 --> 16:22.944
What on earth have you
been doing?

16:23.027 --> 16:24.862
Oh, I fixed that stile but
some of the signposts
are rotted.

16:24.946 --> 16:26.823
-I'll do them tomorrow.
-LEXIE: Okay.

16:26.906 --> 16:29.909
-Hello you.
-Oh, you're all sweaty
and revolting.

16:29.992 --> 16:32.203
PAUL: Yeah, but in a good way.

16:51.639 --> 16:52.724
Now,

16:53.433 --> 16:55.059
tell me!

16:55.143 --> 16:57.353
How long have you
two been married?

16:59.230 --> 17:02.025
-Actually, we're not married.
-Not married that long, no,

17:02.108 --> 17:03.484
just a few months.

17:05.236 --> 17:08.448
Molly lost her first husband,
Hector,

17:08.531 --> 17:11.576
-two years ago.
-Oh, how dreadful.

17:11.659 --> 17:15.454
Yes, and Golly was
a very dear and old friend.

17:15.538 --> 17:18.415
And the friendship
grew to something else.

17:19.584 --> 17:22.170
Yes. I mean at first
I thought...

17:22.252 --> 17:24.380
I should, you know,
I should keep my distance,

17:26.590 --> 17:28.134
then I realised

17:29.177 --> 17:30.720
what a terrible waste
that would be.

17:33.348 --> 17:36.392
-EDITH: So, he proposed!
-GOLLY: Yes, yes, I did.

17:39.062 --> 17:41.564
It was late in the spring,
one evening, and,

17:42.899 --> 17:46.027
you know just down
by the lochside,

17:46.109 --> 17:47.820
watching the sun set
over the mountain.

17:50.698 --> 17:53.158
I knew that, if I didn't
speak then...

17:55.161 --> 17:56.286
I would be lost forever.

18:04.295 --> 18:06.381
-How lovely!
-(MOLLY CLEARS THROAT)

18:07.215 --> 18:08.883
Yes. Yes, it was.

18:12.553 --> 18:14.389
Tell me about your son.

18:14.472 --> 18:15.598
Oh!

18:15.682 --> 18:17.934
Don't let's talk
about Charlie!

18:18.017 --> 18:19.727
Went off to Australia,

18:19.811 --> 18:22.480
haven't had so much as
a postcard since!

18:36.744 --> 18:40.123
See, that way we can talk
while you're in the bath.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.000
Oh, great. (CLEARS THROAT)

18:48.548 --> 18:50.550
DUNCAN: You know it's great
having you living
here with me.

18:50.633 --> 18:53.636
I don't mean with me,
but in the same house.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.388
Cause we get to be close,

18:55.471 --> 18:57.473
but we've each got
our personal space,

18:57.557 --> 18:59.559
so we don't get on
top of each other.

18:59.642 --> 19:01.310
That's what is best
about this place.

19:02.478 --> 19:04.731
I'd like to have a house
like this,

19:04.814 --> 19:06.441
not that that's ever
gonna happen.

19:07.942 --> 19:09.527
Not unless I get knighted,

19:10.278 --> 19:11.446
or win the lottery,

19:12.363 --> 19:13.781
which isn't likely.

19:13.865 --> 19:14.991
I don't play it.

19:21.039 --> 19:25.001
Oh, yes.
I get plenty of visitors.

19:25.084 --> 19:28.671
You can see their circles
in the long grass
up in the high field.

19:29.422 --> 19:31.382
Their...their circles?

19:31.466 --> 19:33.259
Where they land
their spacecraft.

19:34.761 --> 19:37.638
Mind you, they haven't
been here for a while.

19:37.722 --> 19:40.600
I think they prefer
the States this time of year.

19:44.020 --> 19:45.897
Anyway...

19:45.980 --> 19:48.107
Thank you for
a lovely evening.

19:48.191 --> 19:49.734
GOLLY: Indeed.

19:49.817 --> 19:52.570
If you want to bring Allainn
round, I'll put her
in the horsebox.

19:52.653 --> 19:55.073
Oh, you can do all
that in the morning.

19:55.156 --> 19:56.949
You'll be staying the night.

19:57.033 --> 20:00.328
-Um...
-I am sorry, Edith, but we
really are expected home.

20:00.411 --> 20:02.163
But you can't leave.

20:02.246 --> 20:04.916
Well...perhaps some
other time.

20:04.999 --> 20:08.544
No. I mean, you can't leave.

20:08.628 --> 20:09.837
I've locked the gates,

20:09.921 --> 20:12.674
and I never unlock them
until the morning.

20:12.757 --> 20:14.592
I'll just go and prepare
your room.

20:19.847 --> 20:21.391
(WHISPERING) We can't
stay here!

20:21.474 --> 20:23.226
She's obviously deeply lonely.

20:23.309 --> 20:24.936
She's obviously deeply mental.

20:35.822 --> 20:37.365
Now,

20:37.448 --> 20:39.283
here you are.

20:39.367 --> 20:41.452
EDITH: The bathroom's
just along the corridor.

20:41.536 --> 20:43.371
You have it to yourselves.

20:43.454 --> 20:46.499
-Actually, Edith, I think...
-This'll be fine.

20:46.582 --> 20:49.502
Grand. Oh, I'll find you
some towels.

20:53.297 --> 20:54.716
Right. Er...

20:56.592 --> 20:58.469
I take it I'll be sleeping
on the couch, then.

20:58.553 --> 21:00.263
Oh, don't be so silly.

21:01.014 --> 21:02.223
I mean...

21:03.141 --> 21:04.350
I'll sleep on the couch.

21:09.397 --> 21:10.857
Uh, Jess!

21:13.026 --> 21:14.193
(EXHALES)

21:16.779 --> 21:18.823
I thought you'd disappeared
down the plughole.

21:18.906 --> 21:22.076
JESS: I just fancied some
fresh air, Duncan.
And some space.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.536
Are you comfortable enough?

21:23.619 --> 21:26.414
-I can get you a cushion
from the house.
-Duncan look...

21:26.497 --> 21:29.751
I haven't had a minute
to myself since I moved in.

21:29.834 --> 21:32.337
-I thought the point was
we could be together.
-Aye, together.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.464
Not joined at the hip.

21:34.547 --> 21:37.550
I feel like I am being
smothered by cuddly toys.

21:43.014 --> 21:45.224
If you didn't like them,
why didn't you say?

21:46.934 --> 21:49.145
Look, maybe it was
a mistake moving in.

21:51.314 --> 21:52.774
Maybe we're taking
this too fast.

21:54.192 --> 21:55.693
Can we not talk about it?

21:55.777 --> 21:57.904
I don't want to talk, Duncan.
I just want some room.

21:59.322 --> 22:01.032
You want me
to leave you alone?

22:07.914 --> 22:09.040
Fine!

22:10.416 --> 22:11.584
I'll leave you alone.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.190
(WHISPERING) Are you asleep?

22:35.650 --> 22:36.818
Yes.

22:40.071 --> 22:42.323
She's going to let us go
in the morning, isn't she?

22:43.658 --> 22:46.119
I don't know, Molly.

22:46.202 --> 22:48.246
We might have to spend
the rest of our lives here

22:48.329 --> 22:50.373
pretending to be married.

22:53.376 --> 22:55.670
You were very convincing.

22:55.753 --> 22:58.631
That story of the proposal,
it was lovely.

23:00.425 --> 23:02.969
I never knew you
had such a vivid imagination.

23:05.138 --> 23:07.181
GOLLY: I've imagined it
a hundred times...

23:09.851 --> 23:11.394
But I would never ask.

23:13.896 --> 23:16.065
If I did, and you said no, uh,

23:16.149 --> 23:17.692
we'd lose what we have
now, and...

23:20.486 --> 23:22.321
I couldn't bear that.

23:23.406 --> 23:24.449
No.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.287
No. Neither could I.

23:32.582 --> 23:34.542
Would you have said no?

23:37.545 --> 23:39.172
You never asked.

23:48.389 --> 23:50.016
Egg soldiers?

23:50.099 --> 23:53.728
Actually, it's uovo alla coque
con pane tostado
alla scozzese.

23:55.063 --> 23:57.106
Yes, of course. Squisito.

23:57.982 --> 23:59.359
Bon appetit, ma'am.

24:01.319 --> 24:03.529
Oh, just a moment, Alex.

24:03.613 --> 24:07.158
I've decided to go
on a picnic this afternoon.

24:07.241 --> 24:10.620
There's a simply fabulous
ruined castle in the middle
of a loch

24:10.703 --> 24:12.080
not far from here.

24:12.163 --> 24:15.458
Very secluded.
Wildly romantic.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.211
-If you could prepare
a hamper?
-Certainly, ma'am.

24:18.294 --> 24:20.672
May I inquire as to how many
guests will be attending?

24:20.755 --> 24:21.798
Just two.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.217
You and me,

24:24.300 --> 24:26.386
and your superb
Italian cuisine.

24:28.137 --> 24:29.681
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

24:34.686 --> 24:35.978
(BUZZING)

24:41.609 --> 24:42.610
(BUZZING STOPS)

24:56.791 --> 25:00.003
You know, I can't thank you
two enough.

25:00.086 --> 25:03.297
Takes me the whole morning
to see to the horses
by myself.

25:03.381 --> 25:06.092
We'd love to stay longer,
but we really ought
to get going.

25:06.175 --> 25:09.012
If we could put
Allainn in the horsebox.

25:09.095 --> 25:11.180
Can I interest you
in anything else?

25:11.264 --> 25:12.849
I'm sorry?

25:12.932 --> 25:14.559
I mean the farm.

25:15.268 --> 25:16.602
Everything.

25:16.686 --> 25:19.939
The house, the land,
the livery, the lot.

25:20.023 --> 25:23.693
Â£25,000. Now, that's
a good price, eh?

25:23.776 --> 25:25.987
This place is far too much
for one old wifey,

25:26.070 --> 25:28.614
but you two could manage it.

25:28.698 --> 25:30.783
It'd make a home of it again.

25:30.867 --> 25:33.619
-Edith...
-Look, just take
some time, eh?

25:33.703 --> 25:35.079
Think about it.

25:35.163 --> 25:36.914
EDITH: In fact, come
back tomorrow,

25:36.998 --> 25:38.499
and if you don't want
the farm,

25:38.583 --> 25:40.293
you can take the horse then.

25:50.303 --> 25:51.512
See ya.

25:53.973 --> 25:56.851
Okay, okay.
She is my girlfriend.

25:58.978 --> 26:01.105
What?

26:01.189 --> 26:03.358
-Nothing.
-That's not a nothing look.

26:06.361 --> 26:08.738
Do you disapprove
of Amanda or something?

26:08.821 --> 26:10.573
I, uh, didn't know she
needed my approval.

26:10.656 --> 26:14.160
You ought to get to know her.
She's a good lass.

26:14.243 --> 26:16.245
I know her well enough
to know that she's married.

26:21.501 --> 26:22.752
What, didn't you know?

26:23.670 --> 26:24.796
I didn't know you knew.

26:25.797 --> 26:27.256
Then it doesn't bother you?

26:27.340 --> 26:29.133
Not as much as it bothers you.

26:29.217 --> 26:31.844
-It's not for me to judge.
-Well, I know Archie hasn't
phoned in ages.

26:31.928 --> 26:34.472
-What's that got to do
with anything?
-Everything.

26:34.555 --> 26:38.017
Whether Archie rings
or doesn't ring
is none of your business!

26:38.101 --> 26:41.145
I told you about her cause
I wasn't gonna sit here,
and wait for you to get hurt.

26:41.229 --> 26:43.106
PAUL: Well go and sit
somewhere else.

26:43.189 --> 26:45.358
I don't need you
to look after me. You're my
sister-in-law, not my mother.

27:00.331 --> 27:03.001
I could afford
McDougal's farm, Molly.

27:04.502 --> 27:05.962
I could buy it.

27:06.045 --> 27:07.213
We could buy it.

27:08.214 --> 27:09.674
Run the livery ourselves.

27:10.925 --> 27:12.593
And be Mr and Mrs Mackenzie?

27:33.322 --> 27:34.949
ALEX: You still walk like
my wee Ali,

27:36.659 --> 27:38.327
striding along, head up,

27:40.204 --> 27:42.415
ready to nut anything
in your way.

27:42.498 --> 27:43.916
What are you doing here?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.501
Apart from trespassing.

27:45.585 --> 27:47.045
ALEX: Trying to avoid Dorothy.

27:47.128 --> 27:49.589
I think she might have
designs on me.

27:49.672 --> 27:51.466
-(LAUGHING)
-What's funny?

27:53.092 --> 27:54.385
What's the problem?

27:54.469 --> 27:57.305
I thought you were
an expert in unarmed combat.

27:57.388 --> 27:59.974
That woman could snap your
neck with a single dirty look.

28:02.477 --> 28:03.686
Cheered you up, anyway.

28:06.981 --> 28:10.151
-Where did you get that from?
-This?

28:10.234 --> 28:12.195
I was diving for pearls
off Borneo,

28:12.278 --> 28:14.364
-and this hammerhead shark...
-Forget it.

28:14.447 --> 28:15.740
Hey! Hey!

28:16.324 --> 28:17.408
Hey!

28:19.786 --> 28:20.953
Go on.

28:22.789 --> 28:24.957
Go on, hit me.

28:25.041 --> 28:28.711
Get all that anger
out of your system.
It'll make you feel better.

28:28.795 --> 28:31.964
No, you mean it'll make
you feel better.

28:32.048 --> 28:36.761
I can't get this anger out
of my system
cause it's part of me now.

28:36.844 --> 28:40.264
I've got a scar, too,
you know, and it's in here
and you gave it to me.

28:40.348 --> 28:43.267
I've done some bad things
in my time, but leaving you
was the worst,

28:44.268 --> 28:45.353
easily.

28:47.271 --> 28:49.148
Thing is, at the time,
it was for the best.

28:51.192 --> 28:52.860
I thought it was for the best.

28:57.156 --> 28:59.283
You're a grown woman now.

28:59.367 --> 29:01.536
You know how messed up
and miserable love
can make us.

29:01.619 --> 29:03.996
How sometimes it's impossible
to do the right thing.

29:06.541 --> 29:08.418
Maybe I was just
being selfish, but...

29:09.794 --> 29:11.129
I'm truly sorry if...

29:15.967 --> 29:17.427
I am sorry...

29:19.095 --> 29:20.513
That I hurt you.

29:25.435 --> 29:26.936
Well, where's my hamster?

29:28.104 --> 29:29.439
What?

29:29.522 --> 29:32.275
You promised me
a hamster if I was good.

29:33.234 --> 29:35.778
And I was good.

29:35.862 --> 29:38.197
LEXIE: And when you left
I thought you were
going to buy me one,

29:39.949 --> 29:41.200
but you never came back.

29:42.076 --> 29:43.661
-Ali...
-I was good,

29:43.745 --> 29:45.621
(SOBBING) and you never
even came back.

29:46.664 --> 29:47.957
(SOBBING)

29:49.167 --> 29:50.335
Hey...

29:53.921 --> 29:57.216
-Hey...
-Don't. Just don't even
touch me, okay?

29:57.300 --> 29:59.218
I'll buy you a hamster.
I'll buy you a dozen hamsters.

29:59.302 --> 30:01.804
No, cause it doesn't matter,
now. Cause it's too late.

30:03.890 --> 30:06.392
I'm not leaving until you
say that you forgive me.

30:06.476 --> 30:08.978
Well, I'll never forgive you.
Ever.

30:13.483 --> 30:15.109
Then I'll be here
for a long time.

30:24.827 --> 30:26.245
You're doing
a fine job, Duncan.

30:27.789 --> 30:30.792
So, I should stick
to pruning, is that it?

30:30.875 --> 30:32.710
I know you won't
believe me, but...

30:32.794 --> 30:34.712
I feel really bad
about you and Jess.

30:34.796 --> 30:37.882
Aw, save it. You said yourself
I'm not good enough for her.

30:37.965 --> 30:41.010
Duncan, to a father nobody's
ever good enough
for their daughter.

30:42.470 --> 30:43.805
And all that...

30:43.888 --> 30:46.974
Laying down the law stuff,
I mean I just...

30:47.058 --> 30:49.352
That just helps you pretend
that she's still a wee girl,

30:49.435 --> 30:51.479
and you didn't miss
the best years
of her growing up.

30:53.231 --> 30:55.191
Look, I'm sorry that I screwed
things up for you.

30:56.526 --> 30:58.027
You didn't.

30:58.111 --> 30:59.696
Golly, I'm a grown man.

30:59.779 --> 31:01.447
I can screw things up
for myself.

31:16.421 --> 31:19.716
Paul? Don't tell me
you're here for lunch.

31:19.799 --> 31:22.635
I thought you just grabbed
a trout out of the river
and ate it raw.

31:23.970 --> 31:25.596
Turned out to be
someone else's river.

31:26.389 --> 31:28.641
What's the matter?

31:28.725 --> 31:31.019
I've never been
less than honest with you.

31:31.102 --> 31:33.688
I mean, I've got nothing
to hide, but even if I had,

31:35.106 --> 31:37.150
-I wouldn't.
-Oh!

31:39.402 --> 31:41.029
Lexie's been stirring it.

31:41.112 --> 31:42.697
Why did I have
to hear it from her?

31:43.906 --> 31:46.284
-It's complicated.
-I'm not busy.

31:50.955 --> 31:53.082
Actually, it's not
complicated.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.169
I like you. You like me.

31:56.252 --> 31:58.212
-There's just this...
-Minor detail,

31:59.047 --> 32:00.506
of a husband.

32:02.342 --> 32:04.177
We have an understanding.

32:04.260 --> 32:07.013
It's not something
I like to boast about.

32:08.306 --> 32:10.391
I was hoping you'd be
broad-minded.

32:10.475 --> 32:13.269
I am.
When I get the chance.

32:14.479 --> 32:15.772
I'm sorry.

32:15.855 --> 32:17.690
If I'd told you at
the beginning, then

32:17.774 --> 32:20.360
you'd never have come
near me, and the longer
I left it...

32:24.822 --> 32:27.200
We're having
a good time, aren't we?

32:28.785 --> 32:30.578
-Yeah.
-No commitments,

32:30.661 --> 32:33.664
no obligations,
no complications.

32:33.748 --> 32:34.999
No. None of that.

32:37.627 --> 32:39.212
Are we all right?

32:40.838 --> 32:43.299
So, it's just the one husband
you have, is it?

32:43.383 --> 32:44.509
(AMANDA LAUGHING)

32:46.344 --> 32:48.221
Come on. Let's get you
something to eat.

32:48.304 --> 32:51.099
No. I'll just uh, grab
a trout out of the river.

32:52.475 --> 32:53.643
I've got to go.

32:55.853 --> 32:57.105
See you later.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.487
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

33:15.248 --> 33:17.291
LEXIE: Well, where is it?

33:18.835 --> 33:21.546
-What?
-(GIGGLES) The horse?

33:21.629 --> 33:24.215
Oh! We're going
to collect her tomorrow.

33:24.298 --> 33:25.717
LEXIE: Well, what's she like?

33:25.800 --> 33:28.219
Ah! Beautiful.

33:28.302 --> 33:31.431
The whole place was beautiful.

33:31.514 --> 33:34.475
-In fact, we...
-I know. You stayed the night.

33:34.559 --> 33:35.727
Golly phoned me.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.523
It was a bit weird
you're not being around.

33:41.733 --> 33:43.609
Everybody else just
seems to...

33:44.736 --> 33:46.279
Come and go as they please.

33:48.322 --> 33:51.325
-Including Alex.
-Is he still here?

33:51.409 --> 33:53.745
Yeah. I told him
to get lost, but...

33:53.828 --> 33:55.038
Well, the trouble is...

33:55.913 --> 33:57.165
He already is lost.

33:58.332 --> 33:59.876
Oh, Lexie,

33:59.959 --> 34:02.378
it would be so wonderful

34:02.462 --> 34:05.131
-if you and he could just...
-No, Molly.

34:05.214 --> 34:06.507
You are my family.

34:07.508 --> 34:08.801
Okay? Not him.

34:10.678 --> 34:13.139
As long as you and Golly
are around, then...

34:14.139 --> 34:15.433
I can handle Alex.

34:16.851 --> 34:18.353
I can handle anything.

34:18.811 --> 34:19.937
Okay?

34:24.442 --> 34:25.943
Duncan?

34:26.027 --> 34:28.404
-What the...
-(SIGHS) What?

34:29.781 --> 34:31.991
It looks like a riot
in a charity shop.

34:32.074 --> 34:33.659
I thought Jess had more taste.

34:33.743 --> 34:35.370
She does.

34:35.453 --> 34:37.871
PAUL: Oh, you mean
this was you.

34:37.955 --> 34:39.956
Well, it's...
You know, it's not that...

34:41.292 --> 34:43.418
I mean, it isn't too, um...

34:44.504 --> 34:45.588
No, it's hideous.

34:47.297 --> 34:50.551
It was meant to be all cosy,
you know, warm and welcoming.

34:50.635 --> 34:52.929
I should have
left it like your room.

34:53.012 --> 34:55.306
-What do you mean?
-You know,
like an army barracks,

34:55.389 --> 35:00.186
all super-clean, and tidy.
No clutter, no personality.

35:00.269 --> 35:02.105
Bet you that's what
Amanda likes.

35:02.188 --> 35:04.649
-No personality?
-See, the thing is,

35:04.732 --> 35:06.150
I was...

35:06.234 --> 35:09.487
Having all these stupid
daydreams about marriage

35:09.570 --> 35:11.406
and kids, and

35:11.489 --> 35:14.033
-a life together.
-Hey,

35:14.117 --> 35:15.743
there's nothing stupid
about that.

35:17.412 --> 35:18.746
Is that what you see?

35:19.872 --> 35:20.998
For you and Amanda?

35:23.001 --> 35:25.420
Well, it's, um,
it's different with us.

35:25.503 --> 35:28.172
-How is it?
-Isn't it Jess's birthday
soon?

35:28.256 --> 35:30.675
Maybe you could do
something for her.

35:30.758 --> 35:32.468
Like get rid of this lot,
you mean?

35:38.016 --> 35:40.727
Dorothy's fired you?
(LAUGHS)

35:40.810 --> 35:42.812
You've only been up there
for about 12 hours.

35:42.895 --> 35:45.523
That's nothing. My record's
eight-and-a-half minutes.

35:47.608 --> 35:51.237
Why go for a job
as a chauffeur
if you can't even drive?

35:51.320 --> 35:52.572
I can drive.

35:52.655 --> 35:54.449
-As a matter of fact...
-Ah, don't tell me!

35:54.531 --> 35:56.826
You taught, uh,
Michael Schumacher everything
he knows.

35:56.909 --> 36:00.538
-Well, maybe not everything.
-Oh!

36:00.621 --> 36:02.290
The thing is, she was
getting kind of keen.

36:02.372 --> 36:03.999
(LAUGHING)

36:04.083 --> 36:07.170
I don't want to get
involved with Dorothy.
I came here to see you.

36:07.253 --> 36:08.838
Oh, I thought you
were on the run!

36:09.671 --> 36:11.090
Aye, that as well.

36:11.174 --> 36:12.675
Looks like you're gonna
have to keep on running.

36:12.758 --> 36:15.762
-I was gonna ask Golly
to let me move back in.
-Uh-uh.

36:15.845 --> 36:17.597
You leave Golly be.

36:21.559 --> 36:22.684
(SIGHS)

36:22.768 --> 36:25.563
All right okay, you can
stay here for a while.

36:25.646 --> 36:27.440
Until you get a place
of your own.

36:27.523 --> 36:29.776
-I promise, you'll
not regret...
-No!

36:29.859 --> 36:32.195
Don't make me
any promises, okay?

36:32.278 --> 36:35.865
-But I've changed...
-No more stories.

36:35.948 --> 36:39.035
Look, I don't want to hear
about the time that you,

36:39.118 --> 36:42.455
you wrestled with a polar bear
or walked on the moon.

36:42.538 --> 36:44.582
-How'd you know about that?
-Oh, stop it!

36:45.458 --> 36:46.584
I can't help it.

36:48.378 --> 36:50.922
All my life, I've made
things up as I go. It just...

36:51.005 --> 36:52.715
gets so tangled.

36:56.177 --> 36:58.471
The Russian Mafia? (GIGGLES)

36:58.554 --> 37:01.182
I mean for Pete's sake!

37:01.265 --> 37:03.309
-Sounded dramatic though, eh?
-Hmm.

37:05.728 --> 37:08.272
Look, if you need money,
just ask.

37:08.356 --> 37:11.901
I don't need money, Lexie.
I've no debts,
no reason to run.

37:13.569 --> 37:16.114
I want to settle down
and there's nowhere
I'd rather be.

37:20.702 --> 37:22.495
You just called me

37:25.248 --> 37:27.250
You could call me Dad.

myself to tell her.

until I found out
they'd split.

DUNCAN: Whoo-hoo!

52:59.432 --> 53:00.767
(CHEERING)

53:13.529 --> 53:14.864
(LAUGHING)

53:21.079 --> 53:22.330
(CLAPPING)
