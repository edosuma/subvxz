03:21.267 --> 03:23.894
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

03:27.481 --> 03:29.732
Fu... Fucking top five.

03:29.733 --> 03:32.486
That was fucking... top five.

03:38.825 --> 03:40.868
So what are you saying?

03:45.623 --> 03:49.542
Are you saying women
have it easier than men?

03:49.543 --> 03:53.128
Look, all I'm saying
is that you guys...

03:53.129 --> 03:55.381
women have one certain luxury

03:55.382 --> 03:57.299
that us men just do not have.

03:57.300 --> 03:58.508
Oh, yeah?

03:58.509 --> 04:02.221
And what is this one luxury,
might I ask, baby?

04:03.889 --> 04:05.890
Let me get my breath,
and I'm gonna tell you.

04:05.891 --> 04:07.475
I'm gonna spell it out for ya.

04:07.476 --> 04:09.394
How do I know it's gonna
be pure genius?

04:24.200 --> 04:25.367
Fine.

04:27.536 --> 04:29.997
No matter how I say this, I'm
gonna be the fucking asshole,

04:30.038 --> 04:31.497
so I'm just gonna come out
and say it, all right?

04:31.498 --> 04:33.249
Sweet!

04:33.250 --> 04:35.667
This whole equality thing...

04:35.668 --> 04:37.085
is crap.

04:37.086 --> 04:38.337
God, you've got
a gift for delivery.

04:38.338 --> 04:40.046
It's bullshit.
Look, just hear me out.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.632
All I'm saying is that
you and I are not equal.

04:42.633 --> 04:45.718
Sure, we all slave away
at our dead-end

04:45.719 --> 04:47.804
stupid-ass jobs
just like each other.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.680
But there's a difference:

04:49.681 --> 04:51.348
The luxury.

04:51.349 --> 04:54.059
The one luxury
that we do not have.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.687
And?

04:56.688 --> 04:59.523
It is not okay for us
to be dependent

04:59.524 --> 05:00.483
on someone else.

05:00.484 --> 05:02.692
What? Exactly that.

05:02.693 --> 05:03.777
You can work your ass off.

05:03.778 --> 05:05.236
You can go to college,
get a degree,

05:05.237 --> 05:07.655
and get a job just like me.

05:07.656 --> 05:10.116
But what I can't do
is say "Fuck it"

05:10.117 --> 05:11.992
and choose to depend
on someone else.

05:11.993 --> 05:13.619
Only women have that right.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.913
If I do it, I'm a bum
or a gigolo.

05:15.914 --> 05:17.331
If you do it,
you're a housewife.

05:17.332 --> 05:20.625
Or even better yet,
a domestic engineer.

05:20.626 --> 05:23.503
Give me a fucking break!

05:23.504 --> 05:26.172
You're right. I know.

05:26.173 --> 05:29.425
You're the fucking asshole.

05:29.426 --> 05:32.052
Come on.

05:32.053 --> 05:33.679
Where are you going?

05:33.680 --> 05:36.557
To flush down your demon seeds.

05:36.558 --> 05:40.644
You know, it's incredible
to me how someone

05:40.645 --> 05:43.688
who appears to be so smart
can be so fucking dumb!

05:43.689 --> 05:44.856
Yeah, well, you're
just pissed off

05:44.857 --> 05:46.607
that you know
that shit's all true.

05:46.608 --> 05:48.025
Fucking hamstring.

05:48.026 --> 05:50.194
Whatever.

05:50.195 --> 05:51.320
Tell me that it's not.

05:51.321 --> 05:52.571
Whatever! Yeah. You know.

05:52.572 --> 05:54.323
Kiss my ass.

05:54.324 --> 05:57.576
Why is it we always get
into these heated discussions

05:57.577 --> 05:58.857
right when we're done
having sex?

06:00.121 --> 06:02.414
Maybe because
I'm left unsatisfied

06:02.415 --> 06:05.875
and need to take my
frustrations out somewhere?

06:05.876 --> 06:08.461
That's not what you were
screaming a couple of minutes ago.

06:08.462 --> 06:10.629
Yeah? What was
I screaming, big guy?

06:10.630 --> 06:13.299
"Oh, Chris, stop. Chris, stop.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.634
"Oh, stop! Chris, please
don't stop." Shut up!

06:15.635 --> 06:17.302
Ow! You just
hit me in the balls.

06:17.303 --> 06:18.429
Good. You deserve it.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.940
Sit down.

06:36.654 --> 06:39.406
So... So...

06:39.407 --> 06:41.157
When do you think you're just
gonna come out and say it?

06:41.158 --> 06:43.118
Say what?

06:43.119 --> 06:45.453
How deeply in love
with me you are.

06:45.454 --> 06:47.705
In your dreams.

06:47.706 --> 06:51.584
Baby, it's all right. I know.

06:51.585 --> 06:54.461
Christopher, could you
be more full of yourself?

06:54.462 --> 06:56.213
I could.

06:56.214 --> 06:58.382
I just choose to keep
my arrogance toned down

06:58.383 --> 07:00.717
around women I'm giving
the hot beef injection to.

07:00.718 --> 07:03.261
What are you, in third grade?

07:03.262 --> 07:04.888
What, you don't like
"hot beef injection"?

07:04.889 --> 07:06.889
How about my one-eyed snake?
My Dodger dog?

07:06.890 --> 07:08.391
My giggle stick?

07:08.392 --> 07:10.726
You're impossible.

07:10.727 --> 07:12.686
I'm cheap and I'm easy.
Tell all your friends.

07:12.687 --> 07:14.730
Do you ever stop?

07:14.731 --> 07:17.649
I'll stop when you admit
your everlasting love for me.

07:17.650 --> 07:20.485
Well, then you better get
comfortable, Mr. Giggle Stick.

07:20.486 --> 07:22.320
Oh, I'm good.

07:22.321 --> 07:25.240
Okay.

07:25.241 --> 07:26.241
Good.

07:28.327 --> 07:31.495
Seriously, Leslie.

07:31.496 --> 07:34.456
I know that...

07:34.457 --> 07:37.251
you have feelings for me.

07:37.252 --> 07:39.127
Where is this coming from?

07:39.128 --> 07:40.921
I mean, I thought we were
just having fun here.

07:40.922 --> 07:42.964
Isn't that what you say?
We're friends who fuck.

07:42.965 --> 07:44.299
I'm being serious here.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.759
Like, why is that
so hard for you to admit?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.427
'Cause we're friends,
Christopher.

07:48.428 --> 07:50.930
That's all we ever are,
that's all we'll ever be:

07:50.931 --> 07:54.141
Friends.

07:54.142 --> 07:56.185
I mean, look at us.
It would never work.

07:56.186 --> 07:58.186
You're way too fast for me,

07:58.187 --> 08:03.066
and I'm way too
demanding for you, and...

08:03.067 --> 08:04.985
And I like the way things are.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.571
Don't you?

08:08.572 --> 08:10.574
I just thought...

08:12.701 --> 08:14.785
Never mind.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.413
What? No, never mind. You're right.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.085
You couldn't handle me anyway.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.462
Excuse me?

08:26.463 --> 08:29.298
I believe I just handled you
three times, if I'm not mistaken.

08:29.299 --> 08:31.258
Is that what you call handling?
Yeah.

08:31.259 --> 08:33.344
'Cause I was taking it
easy on you.

08:33.345 --> 08:36.388
I send broads
to the chiropractor.

08:36.389 --> 08:38.724
God, if only your dick
was as big as your ego.

08:38.725 --> 08:41.017
If it was, I wouldn't
be able to walk around.

08:41.018 --> 08:43.687
And neither would you,
for that matter.

08:47.900 --> 08:51.318
Anyway, I don't
hear you complaining.

08:51.319 --> 08:54.405
That's because you never shut up
long enough for me to get a word in.

08:54.406 --> 08:56.323
You love my dick
as much as you love me.

08:56.324 --> 08:58.450
Oh, shut up!

08:58.451 --> 08:59.868
You know what I think?

08:59.869 --> 09:01.203
Uh-uh, but I'm pretty sure
you're gonna tell me.

09:01.204 --> 09:03.204
I think that you're the one
who's in love with me

09:03.205 --> 09:04.747
and you're just projecting.

09:04.748 --> 09:06.416
Yeah, that's it! No, I'm ser...

09:06.417 --> 09:08.668
You're trying to get me
to admit to loving you

09:08.669 --> 09:10.461
because you're too much
of an insecure pussy

09:10.462 --> 09:11.662
to just come out and admit it.

09:13.298 --> 09:15.257
Well, you've obviously put
a lot of thought to this.

09:15.258 --> 09:17.884
Actually, no. It was just this
brilliant realization that came to me.

09:17.885 --> 09:20.513
Are you saying that...

09:20.555 --> 09:22.389
given the extreme unlikelihood

09:22.390 --> 09:24.517
that I actually did
have feelings for you,

09:24.558 --> 09:26.559
that if I were
to make those known,

09:26.560 --> 09:28.644
that you would then
step to the plate

09:28.645 --> 09:30.271
and acknowledge your
undying love for me?

09:30.272 --> 09:32.148
I'm not letting you
off the hook like that.

09:32.149 --> 09:34.233
Like what? It doesn't work
like that, Christopher.

09:34.234 --> 09:35.943
Love is not negotiable.

09:35.944 --> 09:38.904
Oh, baby,
everything's negotiable.

09:38.905 --> 09:40.906
No, not love.

09:40.907 --> 09:45.118
Not love. Love is...
a guessing game.

09:45.119 --> 09:47.286
And that's the beauty of it.
There's no guarantees.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.956
It's like... diving
into a pool of water

09:49.957 --> 09:52.458
without knowing
if it's shallow or deep.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.751
And sure, yeah, if it's shallow,

09:53.752 --> 09:57.297
you end up hurt and
paralyzed from the neck down.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.425
But if it's deep...

10:03.761 --> 10:04.803
you know...

10:08.474 --> 10:10.099
It's a leap of faith.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.852
It's like throwing yourself out
there without any guarantees, dude,

10:12.853 --> 10:14.396
and that's what life's about.

10:16.898 --> 10:19.649
Okay, you know
those carnival games, right?

10:19.650 --> 10:21.943
And you know how some of them
are really hard to win

10:21.944 --> 10:24.112
and some of them are super easy
and everyone wins?

10:24.113 --> 10:25.655
Sure.

10:25.656 --> 10:26.781
Well, it's just that
that's the difference

10:26.782 --> 10:28.283
between love and sex.

10:29.868 --> 10:32.203
Sex is the game where everyone

10:32.204 --> 10:35.748
wins a little prize,
and no one goes home a loser.

10:35.749 --> 10:40.461
And... love is the game
that's really hard to win.

10:46.050 --> 10:48.342
But if you do,
and you get to take home

10:48.343 --> 10:53.305
that life-sized
stuffed rhinoceros,

10:53.306 --> 10:55.891
it feels a whole lot better
than taking home

10:55.892 --> 10:58.019
that shitty little
plastic key chain.

11:13.658 --> 11:15.200
Hey.

11:15.201 --> 11:17.537
Yeah?

11:20.748 --> 11:24.000
You've got a fucked-up way
of explaining shit.

11:24.001 --> 11:25.919
I mean... fuck!

11:35.345 --> 11:36.846
Good night, Christopher.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.813
Good night.

I'm not gay now, am I?

13:15.854 --> 13:19.106
I don't know. Did you like it?

13:19.107 --> 13:21.775
No. Then no, you're not gay.

13:21.776 --> 13:24.444
But at least now you're sure.

13:24.445 --> 13:25.945
Yeah.

13:25.946 --> 13:29.490
You sore?

13:29.491 --> 13:31.450
A little. It gets better.

13:31.451 --> 13:32.619
Yeah? Yeah.

13:36.873 --> 13:38.665
I don't care.

13:38.666 --> 13:40.334
Whatever.

13:41.669 --> 13:44.254
You know, you don't have
to feel bad about this.

13:44.255 --> 13:45.964
About what? About us having fun.

13:45.965 --> 13:47.173
There's nothing wrong with it.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.175
Yeah, I know. I'm just...
I'm not gay, so...

13:49.176 --> 13:52.303
I just saying you don't
have to feel bad about it.

13:52.304 --> 13:54.179
Everyone fools around
at least once,

13:54.180 --> 13:56.014
whether they admit it or not.

13:56.015 --> 13:57.766
I can't tell you
how many straight boys

13:57.767 --> 13:59.309
I've had this same
conversation with.

13:59.310 --> 14:01.312
What conversation is that?

14:05.316 --> 14:08.694
The "talk you down from
the ledge" conversation.

14:10.737 --> 14:12.446
What ledge, man?
What are you talking about?

14:12.447 --> 14:15.783
You frat boys,
you're all the same!

14:15.784 --> 14:18.327
You're all caught up in
this bullshit machismo world

14:18.328 --> 14:20.829
that is forced upon you,

14:20.830 --> 14:22.497
so you're afraid to have
a sensitive side.

14:22.498 --> 14:24.415
Bullshit.

14:24.416 --> 14:25.833
Bullshit my ass.
Right now, you're a jumper.

14:25.834 --> 14:27.752
I so wish I knew what the fuck

14:27.753 --> 14:29.128
you were talking
about right now.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.963
You're on the ledge
ready to jump

14:30.964 --> 14:31.882
'cause you can't
deal with the fact

14:31.883 --> 14:33.323
that you liked
having sex with a man.

14:35.635 --> 14:38.595
It's true.

14:38.596 --> 14:41.723
And then I come in and I give you this
whole shtick about how you're not gay

14:41.724 --> 14:43.892
and everyone does it
at least once.

14:43.893 --> 14:46.644
And then eventually, you
come back down off that ledge.

14:46.645 --> 14:50.481
But now you're still left with
a hint of regret and guilt,

14:50.482 --> 14:52.358
and you push it
deep down inside,

14:52.359 --> 14:55.152
and it's locked away,
never to be mentioned again.

14:55.153 --> 14:58.488
Just a distant memory that you'll
come to deny ever even happened.

14:58.489 --> 15:01.366
It's a college campus cliché.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.493
The homophobic frat boy
that loves it in the ass,

15:03.494 --> 15:05.913
but doesn't want anybody
to know about it.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.666
It's sad, really.

15:12.961 --> 15:15.045
Not me. Whatever.

15:15.046 --> 15:16.214
Whatever.

15:18.966 --> 15:20.133
I'm not homophobic.

15:20.134 --> 15:22.385
You're kidding me!
I'm not homophobic.

15:22.386 --> 15:23.762
Then why keep it a secret?

15:23.763 --> 15:25.638
Because it's nobody's
fucking business.

15:25.639 --> 15:27.056
You think I can't read you?

15:27.057 --> 15:29.475
You're the definition
of homophobic.

15:29.476 --> 15:31.727
The mere thought of the
possibility of you being gay

15:31.728 --> 15:33.103
scares you beyond belief.

15:33.104 --> 15:34.480
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

15:34.481 --> 15:36.148
Whatever helps you
sleep at night.

15:36.149 --> 15:37.316
What the fuck's your problem?

15:37.317 --> 15:38.734
I'm not the one
with the problem, boy!

15:38.735 --> 15:40.903
Don't call me "boy,"
you fucking faggot!

15:44.782 --> 15:47.158
Well, there it is.

15:47.159 --> 15:48.784
I was waiting for it. What?

15:48.785 --> 15:50.453
You just proved my entire point.

15:50.454 --> 15:53.289
'Cause I called you a faggot?
Bingo.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.124
What the fuck does that mean, "bingo?"
You know what?

15:55.125 --> 15:56.667
I'm really tired,
and I'm sick of having

15:56.668 --> 15:58.085
to explain everything to you.

15:58.086 --> 16:00.296
So if you don't mind,
I'd rather you just leave.

16:02.340 --> 16:04.216
Why did you do it?

16:07.428 --> 16:09.471
What do you care?

16:12.849 --> 16:14.768
I want to know.

16:18.438 --> 16:21.773
You really want to know why?

16:21.774 --> 16:23.401
Yeah.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.533
Power.

16:32.576 --> 16:34.118
Power?

16:34.119 --> 16:36.537
Yeah.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.538
Power.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.666
Elaborate.

16:41.667 --> 16:45.503
My whole life, starting
from grade school

16:45.504 --> 16:46.879
up until the point
I came out of the closet,

16:46.880 --> 16:50.216
I was beaten up,

16:50.217 --> 16:51.842
ridiculed, made fun of,

16:51.843 --> 16:55.721
and completely alienated
because of the way I was born,

16:55.722 --> 17:00.685
because I'm attracted to guys.

17:02.770 --> 17:06.564
You can't fucking imagine how
powerless this makes someone feel,

17:06.565 --> 17:10.108
how powerless I felt.

17:10.109 --> 17:12.944
All through high school,
I had to hide who I was

17:12.945 --> 17:16.574
for fear of people
finding out the truth.

17:18.910 --> 17:21.036
I even dated girls.

17:21.037 --> 17:24.122
I had sex with them

17:24.123 --> 17:26.582
just so that...

17:26.583 --> 17:28.751
people thought
that I was straight,

17:28.752 --> 17:33.839
that I was... normal.

17:33.840 --> 17:37.302
And it tore me up inside.

17:41.264 --> 17:43.099
To the point where...

17:46.769 --> 17:48.520
Never mind.

17:48.562 --> 17:50.688
What?

17:50.689 --> 17:53.565
Nothing. Um...

17:53.566 --> 17:56.110
Forget it. Please. What?

17:59.447 --> 18:02.824
I tried to kill myself,
all right?

18:02.825 --> 18:05.493
I tried to commit
fucking suicide because...

18:05.494 --> 18:10.289
I couldn't deal with who I was.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.709
I was afraid of people
finding out the truth about me.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.961
Are you serious?

18:15.962 --> 18:18.422
Yeah.

18:18.423 --> 18:20.341
I hated myself for who I was.

18:23.385 --> 18:25.721
For who I am.

18:34.354 --> 18:36.230
Kinda pathetic, huh?

18:36.231 --> 18:37.732
No, man, it's not.

18:40.401 --> 18:44.362
Yeah, well, eventually...

18:44.363 --> 18:46.447
once I got to college, I
wasn't too different from you.

18:46.448 --> 18:49.283
I-I joined a frat
and drank lots of beer

18:49.284 --> 18:54.580
and made the usual
homoerotic gay jokes.

18:54.581 --> 18:57.208
Then I met a guy, and...

19:00.878 --> 19:02.922
He wasn't too different
from you and me.

19:05.716 --> 19:08.968
He helped me accept who I am.

19:08.969 --> 19:11.220
Just a regular person...

19:11.221 --> 19:13.014
just like everyone else.

19:15.934 --> 19:18.393
And it was kind of crazy because

19:18.394 --> 19:20.562
as soon as I made
the decision to come out,

19:20.563 --> 19:24.567
that feeling of
powerlessness just vanished.

19:26.777 --> 19:32.031
Granted, I still have to deal
with my family and friends, but...

19:32.032 --> 19:34.117
as soon as I made that
decision that I was happy,

19:34.159 --> 19:36.618
that I loved myself,

19:36.619 --> 19:39.788
it didn't matter
what anyone else thought.

19:39.789 --> 19:42.499
It was like, "Fuck them
if they can't deal with it."

19:42.500 --> 19:44.667
I'm gay.

19:44.668 --> 19:47.838
I've always been gay,
and I always will be gay.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.634
That's kinda cool, man.

20:25.289 --> 20:26.914
Think I'm like how you are?

20:26.915 --> 20:30.419
I'm not arrogant enough to
pretend to know who you are.

20:31.878 --> 20:36.089
You might be like me.
You might just be curious.

20:36.090 --> 20:38.967
But either way,
whatever you are,

20:38.968 --> 20:42.429
don't try and cater
to other people's ideas

20:42.430 --> 20:44.848
of what you should be.

20:46.475 --> 20:47.684
You just be you.

20:59.070 --> 21:01.197
So, are you?

21:02.406 --> 21:03.949
What, gay?

21:10.122 --> 21:11.581
Yeah.

21:14.542 --> 21:16.044
I don't know.

21:18.838 --> 21:20.798
Still trying to figure
out if I liked it.

21:25.970 --> 21:27.471
You wanna give it another shot?

21:30.432 --> 21:32.058
Maybe you're a pitcher.

21:35.437 --> 21:37.522
As long as you promise
not to tell anyone.

21:43.486 --> 21:45.446
Yeah, why not?

21:56.873 --> 21:59.916
You okay?

21:59.917 --> 22:01.502
I think so.

22:03.587 --> 22:05.506
Did you bleed?

22:10.052 --> 22:11.511
It doesn't look like it.

22:13.930 --> 22:16.015
Did the condom stay on?

22:23.314 --> 22:25.857
Did it feel good?

22:25.858 --> 22:27.192
Yeah!

22:32.197 --> 22:33.365
Did it feel good for you?

22:35.200 --> 22:36.325
I don't know.

22:36.326 --> 22:37.868
It kinda hurt,
but towards the end,

22:37.869 --> 22:39.536
I think it started to feel good.

22:39.537 --> 22:41.079
You think?

22:41.080 --> 22:44.082
Well, it all happened so fast.

22:44.083 --> 22:45.541
What do you mean?

22:45.542 --> 22:47.085
It was just over kinda quickly.

22:47.086 --> 22:48.419
It was my first time, too!

22:48.420 --> 22:51.630
Oh, no, I know!
I wasn't complaining.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.882
It was... I don't know.

22:53.883 --> 22:55.592
I feel kinda weird just
lying here naked with you.

22:55.593 --> 22:58.428
Yeah, me, too.

22:58.429 --> 23:00.555
The only other time
a girl's seen me naked

23:00.556 --> 23:02.849
was when Sherry Kelly gave me
a blowjob in the 10th grade.

23:02.850 --> 23:04.893
Sherry Kelly sucked your dick?

23:04.894 --> 23:06.477
You didn't know that?

23:06.478 --> 23:08.729
How would I know that?

23:08.730 --> 23:10.773
Everyone at school knows!

23:10.774 --> 23:12.274
I threw up on her.

23:12.275 --> 23:14.151
What?

23:14.152 --> 23:16.445
Yeah. It was my first blowjob.

23:16.446 --> 23:19.030
I came the moment her lips
touched my dick.

23:19.031 --> 23:22.409
Anyway, when she was
cleaning me up down there...

23:22.410 --> 23:23.993
I got so nervous, I threw up.

23:23.994 --> 23:25.328
On her?

23:25.329 --> 23:28.498
Yeah, all over.

23:28.499 --> 23:30.333
She's never spoken to me since.

23:30.334 --> 23:33.419
So, that's why she
doesn't talk to you?

23:33.420 --> 23:35.295
Yep.

23:35.296 --> 23:36.672
I can't believe
she told people that.

23:36.673 --> 23:38.757
Well, in her defense,

23:38.758 --> 23:40.550
the only person she told
was Becky Matsuhara.

23:40.551 --> 23:43.344
Becky was the evil bitch
who told everyone else.

23:43.345 --> 23:45.597
They called me
"Pukey Sam the Minuteman"

23:45.598 --> 23:47.306
for a whole year after that.

23:47.307 --> 23:51.393
Constant reminder of just how
much high school sucks ass.

23:51.394 --> 23:52.895
I'm sorry.

23:52.896 --> 23:55.606
Eh, don't worry about it.
It was a long time ago.

23:55.607 --> 23:57.566
Anyway, Becky got hit
by a garbage truck and died

23:57.567 --> 24:00.360
almost a year later to the day.

24:00.361 --> 24:02.697
The universe works in
wonderful and mysterious ways.

24:06.575 --> 24:10.077
So, this really was
your first time?

24:10.078 --> 24:11.246
Yeah.

24:13.373 --> 24:14.748
What? I don't know.

24:14.749 --> 24:17.292
It's just kinda cool,
that's all.

24:17.293 --> 24:19.253
Us losing our virginity
together.

24:22.131 --> 24:24.465
Oh, shit!

24:24.466 --> 24:26.384
What? Who is that? I don't know.

24:26.385 --> 24:28.052
I thought you said
your parents were at work.

24:28.053 --> 24:29.178
They were. I thought
they were. Fuck!

24:29.179 --> 24:31.305
Get dressed really quick. Shit!

24:31.306 --> 24:32.586
Get under the...
Get under the...

24:34.601 --> 24:35.685
I'm hurrying!

24:42.983 --> 24:44.235
Hey. Hi, Mom.

24:45.903 --> 24:48.029
What are you doing? Nothing.

24:48.030 --> 24:51.699
Just... lying down.
I'm a little tired.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.075
Well, were you
talking to someone?

24:53.076 --> 24:54.952
No.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.870
I mean, yeah. Um, it was Bree.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.330
I just got off
the phone with her.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.874
Kristy, what's going on here?

25:00.875 --> 25:01.916
What do you mean?

25:01.917 --> 25:03.418
Did you have someone over here?

25:03.419 --> 25:05.712
No, why? You sure?

25:05.713 --> 25:07.296
Yeah.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.882
Then why does it smell in here?

25:09.883 --> 25:13.135
Mom, I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:13.136 --> 25:16.013
Kristy, I want you to swear

25:16.014 --> 25:17.097
that no one was over here.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.349
I swear.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.477
Okay.

25:26.398 --> 25:29.358
Kristy, you know that
you can talk to me, right?

25:29.359 --> 25:30.818
Yeah, sure.

25:30.819 --> 25:34.780
I mean about boys
and, um... sex.

25:34.781 --> 25:36.532
Mom...

25:36.533 --> 25:39.826
I don't know if your
father and I ever had...

25:39.827 --> 25:41.286
<i>that talk with you.</i>

25:41.287 --> 25:42.370
Mom...

25:42.371 --> 25:43.788
You know, the sex talk.

25:43.789 --> 25:44.998
Anyway, it goes like this.

25:44.999 --> 25:46.374
It, um...

25:46.375 --> 25:49.001
When... When you reach
a certain age, you...

25:49.002 --> 25:51.754
you start having feelings and...

25:51.755 --> 25:53.631
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

25:53.632 --> 25:56.758
Oh, you do?

25:56.759 --> 25:58.885
Yeah. I've known
since the sixth grade.

25:58.886 --> 26:01.054
Don't you remember when
I walked in on you and Dad

26:01.055 --> 26:03.223
doing it dressed like
Superman and Lois Lane

26:03.224 --> 26:04.682
while Tim,
the creepy guy next door,

26:04.683 --> 26:07.101
took notes dressed
as Jimmy the reporter?

26:07.102 --> 26:09.521
Oh... yeah.

26:11.356 --> 26:12.399
Well, um...

26:14.275 --> 26:15.692
Good. Right. Uh...

26:15.693 --> 26:17.569
So I'm here if...
If you ever want

26:17.570 --> 26:18.695
to talk to me, all right?

26:18.696 --> 26:21.948
And, um, if you ever...

26:21.949 --> 26:24.325
are going to...

26:24.326 --> 26:28.788
do anything,
just please be careful.

26:28.789 --> 26:29.872
And, um...

26:29.873 --> 26:33.501
use, um... you know...

26:34.919 --> 26:36.461
a condom.

26:36.462 --> 26:37.963
Mom. Okay, okay!

26:37.964 --> 26:39.881
I just want you to be...

26:39.882 --> 26:41.633
I just want you to be all right.

26:41.634 --> 26:43.511
I'm fine, Mom, thanks.

26:52.269 --> 26:54.812
Kristy? Yeah?

26:54.813 --> 26:57.815
Better get him out of here
before your father gets home.

27:06.573 --> 27:08.242
Shit.

27:15.999 --> 27:18.041
I am so fucked. Are you?

27:18.042 --> 27:20.544
Yeah, and you are, too, unless
you get the hell out of here.

27:20.545 --> 27:22.171
Enough said.

27:23.255 --> 27:25.715
What are you doing?

27:25.716 --> 27:27.592
Going out the balcony.
What does it look like?

27:27.593 --> 27:28.552
Just go out the front door.

27:28.553 --> 27:30.261
My mom already
knows you're here.

27:30.262 --> 27:31.138
I'm not walking past your mom

27:31.139 --> 27:32.555
after she knows we just did it.

27:32.556 --> 27:34.598
You can deal with
an entire high school

27:34.599 --> 27:36.642
full of people knowing you threw
up during your first blowjob,

27:36.643 --> 27:38.769
but you can't walk past my mom?

27:38.770 --> 27:40.229
Good point.

27:47.319 --> 27:48.528
Nice.

27:48.529 --> 27:50.238
Yeah, it was nice.

27:52.157 --> 27:53.992
Get out of here!

28:08.589 --> 28:10.131
Bye.

28:10.132 --> 28:11.341
Bye.

28:37.448 --> 28:41.326
<i>♪ The specialness of today... ♪</i>

28:41.327 --> 28:43.036
Well, that was nice.

28:43.037 --> 28:45.288
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

28:45.289 --> 28:46.831
You wanna do it again?

28:46.832 --> 28:49.500
No, not right now. Okay.

28:49.501 --> 28:52.087
I just wanna marinate
in this for a while.

29:00.803 --> 29:04.722
You do know this is
just casual, right?

29:04.723 --> 29:06.182
Yeah, of course.

29:06.183 --> 29:07.391
Okay. Good.

29:07.392 --> 29:09.060
'Cause I don't want you
freaking out on me,

29:09.061 --> 29:11.062
catching feelings and shit.

29:11.063 --> 29:12.022
Look, I'm not into girls.

29:12.023 --> 29:13.939
I just like my pussy licked,

29:13.940 --> 29:16.233
and you like to lick it.

29:16.234 --> 29:18.568
That's our dynamic,
no more, no less.

29:18.569 --> 29:20.111
Yeah.

29:20.112 --> 29:21.821
I just want you to get it
through your head right now...

29:21.822 --> 29:24.199
No, it's understood.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.660
No feelings whatsoever. Okay.

29:28.370 --> 29:30.204
Anyway, I'm not...
I'm not gay either.

29:30.205 --> 29:31.956
You know, this is...

29:31.957 --> 29:33.624
It's fun.

29:33.625 --> 29:35.042
Okay, whatever.

29:35.043 --> 29:36.376
You don't have to hide
the fact that you're gay.

29:36.377 --> 29:38.712
I don't care. I'm not.

29:38.713 --> 29:40.297
Look, you can do
whatever you want.

29:40.298 --> 29:42.966
I just don't want you falling
in love with me, that's all.

29:42.967 --> 29:44.759
I don't have patience
for that type of of bullshit,

29:44.760 --> 29:46.136
man or woman.

29:47.930 --> 29:49.348
Okay.

29:52.767 --> 29:56.770
Nikki, you think I'm gay?

29:56.771 --> 29:57.897
Aren't you?

30:00.650 --> 30:02.901
I mean, I don't know.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.945
Well, anyone that likes pussy as
much as you do has got to be gay.

30:05.946 --> 30:08.948
All right!
I like guys, too, okay?

30:08.949 --> 30:11.951
Really? When was the last
time you were with a guy?

30:11.952 --> 30:13.410
Uh, high school.

30:13.411 --> 30:15.205
Okay. Did you like it?

30:16.998 --> 30:18.623
That's what I thought.

30:18.624 --> 30:19.624
Look, who cares, okay?

30:19.625 --> 30:20.834
You like pussy, I like dicks.

30:20.835 --> 30:22.460
No big deal. Whoa, whoa.

30:22.461 --> 30:24.128
Do you have to be
so crude about it?

30:24.129 --> 30:25.964
What's that mean?

30:25.965 --> 30:27.673
I mean, like... I don't know.

30:27.674 --> 30:29.759
You can be... You can be...

30:29.760 --> 30:33.304
really abrasive sometimes,
you know, that's all.

30:33.305 --> 30:35.848
No, that's the way I talk.

30:35.849 --> 30:38.392
If you don't like it,
too fucking bad, okay?

30:38.393 --> 30:40.352
I'm blunt; I call it
as I see it.

30:40.353 --> 30:41.978
Really? Yeah.

30:41.979 --> 30:43.021
You're an aspiring rug muncher

30:43.022 --> 30:45.273
who makes me come.

30:45.274 --> 30:48.192
Well, I'm a raging bitch
who loves the cock.

30:48.193 --> 30:50.528
That's the reality
of the situation.

30:50.529 --> 30:52.404
Look, the only reason
I let you go down on me

30:52.405 --> 30:54.323
is because it's been a little
slow around the dorms lately.

30:54.324 --> 30:55.866
And well, frankly,
I'm a little bored

30:55.867 --> 30:57.242
with the selection
of available fuck sticks

30:57.243 --> 30:58.870
around here, okay?

31:00.997 --> 31:04.208
Oh, Jesus, Kat, please, please
do not get emotional on me, okay?

31:04.250 --> 31:05.917
I'm not emotional! Yes, you are!

31:05.918 --> 31:08.336
I'm a cunt, and you
should know that, okay?

31:08.337 --> 31:09.754
You're my fucking roommate,
for Christ's sake!

31:09.755 --> 31:11.464
Have you ever seen me
be nice to anyone?

31:11.465 --> 31:12.340
No, no, I guess not.

31:12.341 --> 31:14.508
Okay, exactly.

31:14.509 --> 31:16.510
It's just that...

31:16.511 --> 31:19.222
you're so different when
we're fooling around, you know?

31:21.015 --> 31:23.850
Well, yeah! That's 'cause
you're getting me off.

31:23.851 --> 31:25.643
Oh, my God! Like...

31:25.644 --> 31:27.186
Well, maybe it's the only time

31:27.187 --> 31:28.980
I'm able to suppress my
fucking bitchiness long enough

31:28.981 --> 31:31.857
to appear like
a decent human being.

31:31.858 --> 31:34.651
Just in case I haven't
made it clear to you,

31:34.652 --> 31:36.154
Kat, I'm not.

31:40.241 --> 31:41.617
All right. Okay.

31:47.498 --> 31:51.083
You do know you're gay, right?

31:51.084 --> 31:53.168
Yeah.

31:53.169 --> 31:55.963
Is that the first time
you've ever said that?

31:55.964 --> 31:57.256
What, that I'm gay?

31:57.257 --> 31:58.757
Yeah.

31:58.758 --> 32:01.092
Yeah.

32:01.093 --> 32:02.969
Cool. I'm honored.

32:02.970 --> 32:04.554
Oh, shut up.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.848
Look, Kat, I'm serious, okay?

32:06.849 --> 32:09.433
Look, you're being honest with
yourself about who you are.

32:09.434 --> 32:12.937
I don't know. Maybe a little
bit of me is rubbing off on you.

32:12.938 --> 32:14.438
Oh, God forbid.

32:14.439 --> 32:16.899
What? As fucked up as I may be,

32:16.900 --> 32:19.276
I must have some
redeeming qualities, right?

32:19.277 --> 32:21.569
You definitely have a few.

32:21.570 --> 32:23.947
You are a slut.

32:23.948 --> 32:26.574
I can deal with that. Okay.

32:26.575 --> 32:29.577
Just do me a favor and don't
repeat this conversation, okay?

32:29.578 --> 32:32.788
Okay. As long as you don't tell
anybody that you give me steady orgasms.

32:32.789 --> 32:33.831
Deal.

32:33.832 --> 32:35.916
Okay.

32:35.917 --> 32:39.544
So, what, you don't
want anyone to know?

32:39.545 --> 32:41.796
No, it's not that. It's just...

32:41.797 --> 32:44.300
I want to do it on my
own timeline, you know?

32:44.341 --> 32:46.676
And besides,
it's nobody's business.

32:46.677 --> 32:49.053
Eventually, I am gonna come out.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.180
Do your parents know? Fuck no.

32:51.181 --> 32:52.765
They would shit
a solid gold brick

32:52.766 --> 32:54.350
if they were to find out.

32:54.351 --> 32:56.852
Well, listen to you,
Miss Potty Mouth.

32:56.853 --> 32:59.229
Well, it must be
sexually contracted.

32:59.230 --> 33:01.356
Oh, meh-maybe!

33:01.357 --> 33:03.525
But okay, I mean, listen, Kat...

33:03.526 --> 33:05.193
what are they gonna do
when they find out?

33:05.194 --> 33:07.403
Oh, first, they'll
probably disown me.

33:07.404 --> 33:09.447
Then after a while
of not speaking to me,

33:09.448 --> 33:10.906
they'll act like
they're doing me a favor

33:10.907 --> 33:13.742
by having me explain
to them exactly why

33:13.743 --> 33:17.829
I'm making the decision
to be gay.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.541
Oh, my God, that is
just so fucked up.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.544
Tell me about it.

33:25.587 --> 33:27.964
So what's it taste like anyway?

33:27.965 --> 33:29.840
What?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.051
Pussy.

33:34.304 --> 33:35.597
I don't know.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.434
Seriously, I want to know.

33:40.893 --> 33:42.311
Well..

33:43.854 --> 33:45.688
Wha... You wanna know.

33:45.689 --> 33:47.899
Oh, come on.
I don't want to know that bad, okay?

33:47.900 --> 33:48.900
I'm just curious is all.

33:48.901 --> 33:51.444
Oh.

33:51.445 --> 33:53.738
I don't know. It tastes good.

33:54.781 --> 33:56.156
I like it.

33:56.157 --> 33:59.117
Oh, really? I know
you like it, okay?

33:59.118 --> 34:02.162
I just... I mean, like,
what does it taste like?

34:02.163 --> 34:04.122
Look, does it
taste like chicken?

34:04.123 --> 34:06.207
Does it taste like potatoes?

34:06.208 --> 34:07.500
I mean, does it taste like tuna?

34:07.501 --> 34:09.210
Don't! Oh, I can't...

34:09.210 --> 34:10.668
No, it...
You know it smells like tuna.

34:10.670 --> 34:14.047
No, it depends, okay?
It... It depends.

34:14.049 --> 34:16.759
It's always a little
different and... and...

34:18.886 --> 34:20.721
I guess a little salty.

34:22.723 --> 34:24.099
And everybody's unique.

34:27.478 --> 34:28.853
What do I taste like?

34:31.731 --> 34:32.815
What... no...

34:32.815 --> 34:34.733
You asked, Nikki.

34:34.734 --> 34:37.819
I know, but I just...

34:37.820 --> 34:40.530
I just... I mean, like, I would
just assume it's nasty, so...

34:40.531 --> 34:42.157
Why?

34:42.158 --> 34:45.576
It's a moist cavity
between your legs, Kat.

34:45.577 --> 34:46.828
A moist cavity? I've nev...

34:46.829 --> 34:48.329
It is, okay?

34:48.330 --> 34:50.164
And it sometimes gets sweaty,

34:50.165 --> 34:51.456
so it sometimes smells.

34:51.458 --> 34:53.083
It's just...

34:53.083 --> 34:54.668
It's just a little gross.

34:54.668 --> 34:57.254
No, it's not. You definitely...

34:57.255 --> 34:59.298
You want it clean.

35:05.387 --> 35:07.306
You honestly want to know
what you taste like?

35:10.475 --> 35:12.476
Well, I asked didn't I?

35:12.477 --> 35:15.647
Okay. Come here.

35:23.779 --> 35:24.947
Open your legs.

35:42.129 --> 35:44.923
You taste...

35:44.924 --> 35:47.342
so fucking good.

35:50.637 --> 35:53.889
Okay, I'm no lesbo,
but that was really hot.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.683
Yeah. Uh-huh.

35:56.684 --> 36:00.187
Almost made me want
to go down on you.

36:00.188 --> 36:03.065
Really? Almost.

36:07.861 --> 36:11.322
Uhh! Oh!

36:11.323 --> 36:13.532
I forgot how fun that was!

36:13.533 --> 36:17.744
Well, speak for
yourself, old-timer.

36:17.745 --> 36:19.830
I'm gonna hunt down
and kill that doctor

36:19.831 --> 36:21.748
who gave you those pills.

36:21.749 --> 36:24.210
Mmwah!

36:26.337 --> 36:28.171
Can I ask you something?

36:28.172 --> 36:29.672
I hate when you do that.

36:29.673 --> 36:31.340
Ask me if you're gonna
ask me something.

36:31.341 --> 36:33.801
You're already asking
me something

36:33.802 --> 36:35.844
by asking if you can
ask me something.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.429
Okay, I'm sorry.

36:37.430 --> 36:39.097
So? Well...

36:39.098 --> 36:41.558
if you had the chance to go
back in time and change things...

36:41.559 --> 36:43.101
You know, like,
you and I being together,

36:43.102 --> 36:44.852
would you?

36:44.853 --> 36:48.689
Would I change anything
if I could go back in time?

36:48.690 --> 36:50.733
Yeah.

36:50.734 --> 36:52.651
No.

36:52.652 --> 36:54.486
God, no.

36:54.487 --> 36:59.449
Gene, I wouldn't change
a single thing.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.868
I couldn't have dreamed up
a better life

37:01.869 --> 37:05.455
in my best night's sleep.

37:05.456 --> 37:08.082
You're still my knight
in shining armor.

37:08.083 --> 37:10.668
Always have been,
always will be.

37:10.669 --> 37:14.380
You're just as amazing
as the first night I met you.

37:14.381 --> 37:17.884
Who would have thought we would
have found love at a gangbang?

37:23.389 --> 37:25.515
Do you remember that key party

37:25.516 --> 37:29.310
where old Walter Cotton couldn't
get his pecker out of my ass?

37:29.311 --> 37:30.936
Oh, yeah!

37:30.937 --> 37:32.354
Remember the look on his face?

37:32.355 --> 37:34.606
Oh, sure do! Ho ho!

37:34.607 --> 37:36.733
He was like a helpless pup

37:36.734 --> 37:37.986
locked up with a bitch in heat.

37:40.696 --> 37:43.615
All he was missing
was the amused owner

37:43.616 --> 37:46.034
chasing his little water hose.

37:46.035 --> 37:48.119
You remember what
his wife Diane said

37:48.120 --> 37:50.538
after he finally got it out?

37:50.539 --> 37:52.832
Oh, yeah. She said,
"Who wants pudding?"

37:52.874 --> 37:54.458
Whoa, what's wrong
with that crazy woman?

37:54.459 --> 37:58.211
Oh, God! So gross!

37:58.212 --> 38:01.756
Oh, he was a kick
in the pants, huh?

38:01.757 --> 38:02.924
And hung like a horse.

38:02.925 --> 38:04.050
You ain't lying.

38:04.051 --> 38:06.135
He had a dick so big
it'd choke a donkey.

38:06.136 --> 38:07.637
Looked like a baby's leg,
didn't it?

38:07.638 --> 38:09.306
Yeah... a fat baby.

38:11.141 --> 38:13.851
Sex was different back then.

38:13.852 --> 38:18.188
Yeah. Everything was so
much more free, you know?

38:18.189 --> 38:21.107
No rules, no ambitions, no jealousies.

38:21.108 --> 38:22.776
Mm-hmm.

38:22.777 --> 38:25.945
No shaved pubic hair. Mm-hmm.

38:25.946 --> 38:27.864
And no diseases that
you couldn't take care of

38:27.865 --> 38:29.282
with a visit to the doctor

38:29.283 --> 38:30.866
and a quick shot of penicillin.

38:30.867 --> 38:31.867
Today... let me
tell you something...

38:31.868 --> 38:33.202
These kids gotta wear
a coat of armor

38:33.203 --> 38:35.787
before they park their car
in any woman's garage.

38:35.788 --> 38:36.997
I would wear three or four.

38:36.998 --> 38:39.416
Yeah, you would.

38:39.417 --> 38:41.876
Do you remember the night

38:41.877 --> 38:45.129
I brought home
LouAnn and Cecilia

38:45.130 --> 38:48.049
after the Jefferson Airplane
show at the Fillmore?

38:48.050 --> 38:50.426
The summer of 1969. Uh-huh.

38:50.427 --> 38:52.636
I couldn't forget that
if I tried.

38:52.637 --> 38:53.804
No matter how long we live,

38:53.805 --> 38:56.139
I'll never be able to
repay you for that night.

38:56.140 --> 38:58.016
I didn't know
fisting was possible.

38:58.017 --> 38:59.893
Oh, yeah, it's possible.

38:59.894 --> 39:02.020
Hurts like a son of a gun,
but it's possible.

39:02.021 --> 39:05.023
That girl was cryin'! "Whaaa!" Yeah.

39:05.024 --> 39:06.941
She had pleasure
and pain at the same time.

39:06.942 --> 39:08.901
"Aahhh! Wahhhh!"

39:08.902 --> 39:10.694
Oh, God.

39:10.695 --> 39:11.488
Well, it hurt.

39:11.489 --> 39:13.405
Yeah. "Wahhhh!"

39:13.406 --> 39:14.615
I'd say, damn right it hurt.

39:14.616 --> 39:16.200
Somebody got their fist
up your damn thing, girl.

39:16.201 --> 39:18.076
Oh, God!

39:18.077 --> 39:20.453
It won't be feeling good.

39:20.454 --> 39:23.082
Mwah!

39:31.590 --> 39:33.716
What do you think
the kids would think

39:33.717 --> 39:36.260
if they knew about us?

39:36.261 --> 39:37.469
What, you mean about our past?

39:37.470 --> 39:39.679
Yeah.

39:39.680 --> 39:44.767
You mean the swapping
and the... sex stuff?

39:44.768 --> 39:47.145
Yes, you numbskull.

39:47.146 --> 39:48.312
I swear, sometimes I think

39:48.313 --> 39:50.398
you're as thickheaded as a mule.

39:50.399 --> 39:52.441
You don't have to be so nasty.

39:52.442 --> 39:54.151
Maybe they'll have
heart attacks.

39:54.152 --> 39:55.194
You think?

39:55.195 --> 39:56.987
Who would want to think
about their parents

39:56.988 --> 39:58.155
doing the bang-bang-bang?

39:58.156 --> 40:00.156
You know, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang.

40:00.157 --> 40:01.241
Daddy got his drawers off,

40:01.242 --> 40:02.700
big old butt sticking
up in the air.

40:02.701 --> 40:03.661
Bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang.

40:03.662 --> 40:06.663
Oh, shut up.

40:09.166 --> 40:11.251
I always wondered if they knew.

40:16.005 --> 40:20.508
Nah. No way. Mm-mmm.

40:20.509 --> 40:23.595
Do you think, uh...
You think they'd be ashamed?

40:23.596 --> 40:27.515
I don't know; It's hard to
figure out what they think.

40:27.516 --> 40:30.726
Yeah, well, I guess there's no
use in worrying about it now.

40:30.727 --> 40:33.103
No use at all.
Let me tell you something.

40:33.104 --> 40:36.398
We made our decisions, and we lived
through them, and now we're here.

40:36.399 --> 40:38.775
What more can we ask for?

40:38.776 --> 40:40.485
Yeah, you're right.

40:40.486 --> 40:42.737
I know I'm right, baby doll.

40:42.738 --> 40:44.239
Shit, after 40 years
of marriage,

40:44.240 --> 40:46.491
you think you would
figure that out by now.

40:46.492 --> 40:49.076
35 years, Gene.

40:49.077 --> 40:50.536
40, sugar dumplings.

40:50.537 --> 40:52.580
35, honey bun.

40:52.581 --> 40:55.165
Cupcakes, 40.

40:55.166 --> 40:57.000
Gene? Hmm?

40:57.001 --> 40:58.586
What year were we married?

41:00.254 --> 41:02.590
40 years ago.

41:13.141 --> 41:16.018
You ever think we'd end up here?

41:16.019 --> 41:17.311
What do you mean, "here"?

41:17.312 --> 41:20.897
You know, me, you,
together, old?

41:20.898 --> 41:23.358
We're not that old.

41:23.359 --> 41:25.109
Yeah.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.944
We're no spring chickens,
I'll tell you that.

41:26.945 --> 41:28.321
Well, we're not old.

41:28.322 --> 41:31.866
Old is Bea Arthur
and Bob Hope and...

41:31.867 --> 41:34.118
What's that guy
that owns everything?

41:34.119 --> 41:35.285
Ted Turner? Yeah.

41:35.286 --> 41:38.330
They're old. We're not old.

41:38.331 --> 41:40.332
We're... refined.

41:40.333 --> 41:43.209
But Bob Hope is dead.

41:43.210 --> 41:45.920
Yeah, true.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.923
But to answer your question,

41:48.924 --> 41:51.175
I don't know if I ever
thought we'd end up here.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.469
I don't know.

41:53.470 --> 41:55.304
I hoped.

41:55.305 --> 41:58.098
Yeah. Me, too.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.267
You know, out of all
the other women

42:00.268 --> 42:02.435
I buried my bone in...

42:02.436 --> 42:05.605
And you know me, I buried
my bone in a lot of them...

42:05.606 --> 42:09.358
There was never anyone but you.

42:09.359 --> 42:13.280
You've always had
a way with words, Gene.

42:16.115 --> 42:17.866
You old sweet thing, you.
Come on.

42:17.867 --> 42:19.201
Don't call me old.

42:19.202 --> 42:20.453
Bite you.

42:26.875 --> 42:29.502
Fucking... Gotta be...

42:29.503 --> 42:32.756
Goddammit! Get off me!

42:35.216 --> 42:36.925
Whoo!

42:36.926 --> 42:39.052
Can't you come a little quicker?

42:39.053 --> 42:42.972
No, bro.

42:42.973 --> 42:45.933
Oh, buddy.

42:45.934 --> 42:48.020
Mm! Oh, fuck, bro.

42:48.061 --> 42:50.688
Man, wow, that was rockin'.

42:50.689 --> 42:52.898
Rock and roll, man!

42:52.899 --> 42:54.566
Put 'er there, buddy.

42:54.567 --> 42:56.985
Aah! That hurts!

42:56.986 --> 42:58.236
Mmm!

42:58.237 --> 42:59.404
Oh, fuckin'...

42:59.405 --> 43:02.199
Uhh! Whoo!

43:04.743 --> 43:06.035
So what do you want to do?

43:06.036 --> 43:07.578
I don't know.

43:07.579 --> 43:09.205
What's everybody else
doing, man?

43:09.206 --> 43:10.289
They're going dancing.

43:10.290 --> 43:11.540
They're heading down
to Boys Town.

43:11.541 --> 43:13.543
It's '80s night at Rage.

43:15.086 --> 43:17.254
God, our friends are
so fucking gay, man.

43:17.255 --> 43:18.964
Tell me about it.

43:18.965 --> 43:22.050
So what do you think?
I don't know.

43:22.051 --> 43:23.968
Any other ideas? I don't know.

43:23.969 --> 43:25.053
We could stay up all night

43:25.054 --> 43:26.888
and have sex like rock stars,

43:26.889 --> 43:29.432
keep up the neighbors, sweat...

43:29.433 --> 43:30.976
shake the earth.

43:32.811 --> 43:35.729
Sounds pretty nice,
but... I wasn't joking.

43:35.730 --> 43:37.230
My ass kinda hurts.

43:37.231 --> 43:39.232
Wanna go catch a movie
or something?

43:39.233 --> 43:41.568
Oh, yeah? What's out?

43:41.569 --> 43:42.736
Not much.

43:42.737 --> 43:44.654
Seems the only entertainment
I've been getting

43:44.655 --> 43:47.990
from going to the theater is
watching some poor sap pay 12.50

43:47.991 --> 43:52.912
to see some half-assed recycled
excuse for a motion picture.

43:52.913 --> 43:54.872
Yeah, man.

43:54.873 --> 43:56.553
Well, we're two of those
poor saps, mister.

44:01.504 --> 44:04.172
I wanna drive.

44:04.173 --> 44:05.716
I'm driving.

44:13.139 --> 44:16.433
So, uh, how's this
gonna work, man?

44:16.434 --> 44:19.060
What do you mean?

44:19.061 --> 44:22.772
I mean, how's this gonna work?

44:22.773 --> 44:25.858
You mean us? Yes, Bob.

44:25.859 --> 44:28.778
I don't know, Neil.
Why do you ask?

44:28.779 --> 44:30.905
'Cause I wanna fucking know, that's why.

44:30.906 --> 44:32.782
Well, I don't have a
fucking answer, all right?

44:34.909 --> 44:37.661
My ass is so sore.

44:37.662 --> 44:39.996
Well, don't expect me
to be the fucking bitch

44:39.997 --> 44:43.333
in this relationship,
you got it?

44:43.334 --> 44:44.709
I'm the butch.

44:44.710 --> 44:46.627
I've always been the butch.

44:46.628 --> 44:48.338
I'll always be the butch.

44:50.632 --> 44:53.008
Neil's the fucking butch,
you know what I mean?

44:53.009 --> 44:54.134
Fucking Christ,
do we have to have

44:54.135 --> 44:55.761
the State of the Union
talk right fucking now?

44:55.762 --> 44:59.181
Yeah. Yeah, we do. What...

44:59.182 --> 45:00.307
I'm no bitch!

45:00.308 --> 45:02.726
Well, that's our
problem, Einstein.

45:02.727 --> 45:04.686
Why does it have to be
a fucking problem?

45:04.687 --> 45:06.521
'Cause that's the way
it fucking works, man.

45:06.522 --> 45:09.148
There's the bitch
and there's the butch.

45:09.149 --> 45:11.775
I don't make the rules, okay?

45:11.776 --> 45:13.736
That's so passé.

45:13.737 --> 45:14.612
Passé?

45:14.613 --> 45:17.572
Yes, passé.

45:17.573 --> 45:21.077
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe
we've found ourselves a bitch!

45:22.912 --> 45:24.037
Pull over.

45:24.038 --> 45:25.413
Pull over.

45:25.414 --> 45:28.416
So where were we?

45:28.417 --> 45:29.917
Oh, yeah.

45:29.918 --> 45:33.253
Listen, just because
the heterosexual public

45:33.254 --> 45:35.672
has a uniformed stereotype

45:35.673 --> 45:38.091
of what a normal gay
couple's dynamic should be

45:38.092 --> 45:40.552
doesn't mean that we,
the gay community,

45:40.553 --> 45:43.680
have to abide by their
small-minded perceptions

45:43.681 --> 45:46.307
and their inability
to think outside the box.

45:46.308 --> 45:48.267
So what are you proposing?

45:48.268 --> 45:50.186
I'm not proposing anything.

45:50.187 --> 45:52.438
I'm just saying that
just because people expect

45:52.439 --> 45:54.648
a bitch and a butch doesn't...

45:54.649 --> 45:58.735
That doesn't mean that's
the way it has to be.

45:58.736 --> 45:59.945
I mean, look at
Ingrid and Sarah.

45:59.946 --> 46:02.530
They're both fucking
butch as fuck,

46:02.531 --> 46:04.240
and they've been
happily together

46:04.241 --> 46:07.535
for fucking over
5-1/2 years now?

46:07.536 --> 46:09.120
You're right.

46:09.121 --> 46:11.622
Lesbians are so
ahead of the curve.

46:11.623 --> 46:14.875
They are. They're on top
of their fucking game, man.

46:14.876 --> 46:16.919
And you don't see the
two of them feeling bad

46:16.920 --> 46:20.130
for not fitting into the
socially expected archetypes

46:20.131 --> 46:22.549
of what a happy
gay couple should be.

46:22.550 --> 46:24.634
Neil, I just...

46:24.635 --> 46:27.887
I don't understand why this
is bothering you so much.

46:27.888 --> 46:29.597
I don't know, it's just that...

46:29.598 --> 46:33.267
all the gay couples we know,

46:33.268 --> 46:34.935
there's a masculine and a fem.

46:34.936 --> 46:36.812
So?

46:36.813 --> 46:40.273
I don't know, it's just
rare that a gay couple

46:40.274 --> 46:41.775
breaks the mold, that's all.

46:41.776 --> 46:42.901
I think you're forgetting

46:42.902 --> 46:45.403
about the first gay couple, man.

46:45.404 --> 46:46.446
Who's that?

46:46.447 --> 46:48.239
R2-D2 and C-3PO.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.573
What are you talking about?

46:49.574 --> 46:52.618
C-3PO was a total bitch.

46:52.619 --> 46:56.121
Oh, Lord, I do hope we make it
to the launch pad on time.

46:56.122 --> 46:58.874
Hurry, R2. Hurry.

46:58.875 --> 47:01.793
Faggots, man. Faggot talk.

47:01.794 --> 47:04.879
Yeah, but what was R2, then?

47:04.880 --> 47:07.465
Oh, okay. I think I see
where you're going with this.

47:07.466 --> 47:10.843
See? I mean, some can argue
that R2 was the bitch,

47:10.844 --> 47:13.554
I mean, for constantly
putting up with 3PO's shit.

47:13.555 --> 47:14.930
And continuing
to hang out with him

47:14.931 --> 47:16.098
even though
the persistent nagging

47:16.099 --> 47:19.518
by that fucking British twat.

47:19.519 --> 47:20.810
You made your point.

47:20.811 --> 47:23.813
But on a small side note,

47:23.814 --> 47:27.191
R2 and 3P0 weren't
the fist gay couple.

47:27.192 --> 47:29.485
What? Shut up.
Of course they were.

47:29.486 --> 47:31.529
Nope, you're wrong.

47:31.530 --> 47:32.905
Who was it, then?

47:32.906 --> 47:35.157
Gilligan and the Skipper.

47:35.158 --> 47:37.242
Oh, shit! Yeah.

47:37.243 --> 47:38.744
I never thought
about it like that.

47:38.745 --> 47:40.662
You never thought about that?
You kidding me?

47:40.663 --> 47:43.581
You never noticed
the pet name "Little Buddy"?

47:43.582 --> 47:44.875
Come on!

47:44.917 --> 47:46.959
And the fact that
Ginger and Mary Ann,

47:46.960 --> 47:49.420
those fine little pieces of ass,

47:49.421 --> 47:52.172
never got any action
from either one of them?

47:52.173 --> 47:53.757
They were fucking hot, too.

47:53.758 --> 47:56.927
Yeah, if they only had dicks.

47:56.928 --> 47:57.970
And a mouthful.

48:00.348 --> 48:01.848
Oh, yeah.

48:01.849 --> 48:05.476
So I guess no one
has to be the bitch.

48:05.477 --> 48:09.146
Neil, neither of us are
capable of being the bitch.

48:09.147 --> 48:10.940
You're the lead singer
of a hair band,

48:10.941 --> 48:13.150
and I'm a high school
football coach.

48:13.151 --> 48:15.527
We both hate the fuck
out of Barbra Streisand.

48:15.528 --> 48:17.112
Shit.

48:17.113 --> 48:18.488
Listen, I don't know
how it works,

48:18.489 --> 48:19.656
but it does, all right?

48:19.657 --> 48:23.118
And... I'm not gonna change,

48:23.119 --> 48:24.786
and I know you're
not gonna change,

48:24.787 --> 48:27.497
so why should we
fucking change, then?

48:27.498 --> 48:29.582
I mean, you're happy, right?

48:29.583 --> 48:30.542
Oh, yeah.

48:30.543 --> 48:32.251
And I'm happy, too. Yeah.

48:32.252 --> 48:34.170
So fuck everyone!

48:41.218 --> 48:44.679
Neil? Yeah?

48:44.680 --> 48:47.223
Thanks.

48:47.224 --> 48:48.391
For what?

48:48.392 --> 48:49.725
For just being you.

48:49.726 --> 48:51.645
Yeah, no problem.

48:53.271 --> 48:54.897
What?

48:54.898 --> 48:56.190
What what?

48:56.191 --> 48:58.900
I'm glad we're together,
you know, and...

48:58.901 --> 49:01.236
I'm really glad we...

49:01.237 --> 49:04.239
we can talk the way
we do, you know?

49:04.240 --> 49:07.533
I'm just... I'm...

49:07.534 --> 49:10.327
I've never been able to talk to
someone the way I talk to you.

49:10.328 --> 49:11.412
How did this suddenly turn into

49:11.413 --> 49:13.956
<i>an After School Special, man?</i>

49:13.957 --> 49:15.499
Come on, Neil...

49:15.500 --> 49:17.834
just 'cause you're a manly man

49:17.835 --> 49:19.920
doesn't mean you
can't have a heart.

49:19.921 --> 49:22.213
Yeah. Be Neil here.

49:22.214 --> 49:24.258
I'm just sayin' I don't...

49:28.303 --> 49:30.304
I just want you to know that...

49:30.305 --> 49:32.807
I appreciate you, you know?

49:32.849 --> 49:34.933
Are you serious?

49:34.934 --> 49:36.852
Yeah, I'm serious.

49:36.853 --> 49:38.812
Cool.

49:38.813 --> 49:40.231
Thanks.

49:43.526 --> 49:45.526
I appreciate you, too, you know.

49:45.527 --> 49:47.695
I'm sorry if I, uh...

49:47.696 --> 49:49.196
don't express my feelings.

49:49.197 --> 49:53.117
It's just... that's not
really my thing, you know?

49:53.118 --> 49:56.204
<i>Jesus, now I sound like
I'm an After School Special.</i>

49:58.456 --> 50:00.124
It's okay.

50:02.043 --> 50:04.378
I know your deal.

50:24.230 --> 50:26.773
Why do we do this?

50:26.774 --> 50:27.940
I don't know.

50:27.941 --> 50:30.276
It was good, though.

50:30.277 --> 50:31.944
It's always good.

50:31.945 --> 50:34.947
That was never the
problem with us, David.

50:34.948 --> 50:37.449
Yeah, so what was the problem?

50:37.450 --> 50:39.911
The problem is you.

50:42.955 --> 50:44.372
Me?

50:44.373 --> 50:45.957
Yeah, you.

50:45.958 --> 50:47.708
You're emotionally unavailable

50:47.709 --> 50:49.251
and completely unwilling

50:49.252 --> 50:51.545
to open yourself up to anyone.

50:51.546 --> 50:53.005
That is not true.

50:53.006 --> 50:55.632
I'm completely
open with Yesenia.

50:55.633 --> 50:58.468
Her name is Yesenia?

50:58.469 --> 50:59.886
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

50:59.887 --> 51:03.348
Nothing. Never mind.

51:03.349 --> 51:05.475
Anyway, that's why we're
no longer together,

51:05.476 --> 51:07.226
whether you want to
fess up to it or not.

51:07.227 --> 51:08.353
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:08.395 --> 51:09.812
So you're saying the only reason

51:09.813 --> 51:13.148
that we broke up
was because of me?

51:13.149 --> 51:14.233
Yeah.

51:14.234 --> 51:16.401
What about you?

51:16.402 --> 51:18.862
What about me? Hmm, let's see.

51:18.863 --> 51:21.865
You were totally jealous,
completely insecure,

51:21.866 --> 51:23.783
and always certain that
I was cheating on you.

51:23.784 --> 51:27.537
<i>You were always cheating on me.</i>

51:27.538 --> 51:30.915
Yeah, but you didn't know that.

51:30.916 --> 51:33.000
Here's what your
problem is, Jordy.

51:33.001 --> 51:35.419
You are unable to trust anyone.

51:35.420 --> 51:38.630
That's bullshit. I trust Greg.

51:38.631 --> 51:41.508
Wait. His name is Greg,
like Greg Brady?

51:41.509 --> 51:42.509
I love that guy.

51:42.510 --> 51:43.968
I used to watch
that guy growing up.

51:43.969 --> 51:45.638
I'm a big fan.

51:46.680 --> 51:48.264
Yeah, so? He's nice.

51:48.265 --> 51:50.642
And he doesn't stick his dick
in everything that moves.

51:53.311 --> 51:55.854
So I like women? So what?

51:55.855 --> 51:59.065
David, when you're with someone,

51:59.066 --> 52:01.526
you know, together,

52:01.527 --> 52:03.611
the idea is that
you're only with them.

52:03.612 --> 52:06.572
I told you my weaknesses
from the very beginning.

52:06.573 --> 52:08.699
You also told me you'd change.

52:08.700 --> 52:09.784
You said you loved me.

52:09.785 --> 52:12.578
I did love you.

52:12.579 --> 52:14.413
And yet you still
managed to fuck

52:14.414 --> 52:15.497
the majority of my friends,

52:15.498 --> 52:17.374
one in my own bed, no less.

52:17.375 --> 52:20.168
Oh, and this Greg is just the
king of monogamy, I presume?

52:20.169 --> 52:22.879
Greg and I have been
together for over a year,

52:22.880 --> 52:25.799
and he has not so much
as looked at another girl.

52:27.009 --> 52:28.384
That's what you think.

52:28.385 --> 52:31.053
That's what I know.

52:31.054 --> 52:33.806
Greg and I are in love.

52:33.807 --> 52:36.893
Then... why are you here?

52:36.935 --> 52:38.185
Why are you here?

52:38.186 --> 52:40.312
Look, I'm not the one
claiming to be in love.

52:40.313 --> 52:43.732
Yesenia's just a...
a thing, you know?

52:43.774 --> 52:45.483
She knows the deal.

52:45.484 --> 52:48.027
Oh. So...

52:48.028 --> 52:49.320
she'd have no problem

52:49.321 --> 52:50.780
knowing that you just
rented a room in a hotel

52:50.781 --> 52:53.074
so you could fuck
your ex-girlfriend?

52:53.116 --> 52:55.325
Don't analyze me. I don't
need that shit right now.

52:55.326 --> 52:56.994
Why, 'cause it's the truth?

52:56.995 --> 52:58.662
No, because you're not
a fucking psychiatrist.

52:58.663 --> 53:00.288
I'm not paying you
a hundred dollars an hour

53:00.289 --> 53:01.539
to figure out
what's wrong with me.

53:01.540 --> 53:05.001
You're just mad because
you know I'm dead-on.

53:05.002 --> 53:07.253
So what if you're dead-on.
What does that prove?

53:07.254 --> 53:09.172
It proves exactly
what I said before.

53:11.216 --> 53:13.176
You're fucking delusional,
you know that?

53:17.138 --> 53:19.681
If that's not the pot
calling the kettle black...

53:19.682 --> 53:21.766
What?

53:21.767 --> 53:23.768
Look, I know what I am,
and I'm fine with it.

53:23.769 --> 53:26.396
You, on the other hand, are caught
up in this fucking fantasy world

53:26.397 --> 53:27.522
where everyone
is who you want them to be,

53:27.523 --> 53:29.691
but not who they are.

53:34.029 --> 53:36.029
The truth hurts, don't it?

53:36.030 --> 53:38.031
Fuck you.

53:38.032 --> 53:39.908
Aw. Now you're gonna
get all mad at me

53:39.909 --> 53:41.284
because I told you the truth

53:41.285 --> 53:43.119
after you blasted me out of
the water with your judgment?

53:43.120 --> 53:45.080
Fuck you.

53:46.915 --> 53:50.960
And you wonder why I left.

53:50.961 --> 53:53.295
Oh, that's rich.
That's good, Jordy.

53:53.296 --> 53:55.589
You left. Well, that's not really
the way that I remember it.

53:55.590 --> 53:57.924
But that's okay. We can go back and
rewrite the book of "David and Jordy."

53:57.925 --> 54:00.468
Oh, just shut up, okay?

54:00.469 --> 54:02.596
Okay.

54:08.936 --> 54:10.061
You don't still
have feelings for me?

54:10.062 --> 54:13.314
No, of course not.
I am so over you.

54:13.315 --> 54:14.773
Okay, well, you never
answered me, then.

54:14.774 --> 54:16.400
Why are you here?

54:16.401 --> 54:18.735
You never answered me either.

54:18.736 --> 54:20.779
With what? Why are you here?

54:20.780 --> 54:21.988
Jesus Christ, Jordy.

54:21.989 --> 54:25.074
I thought we pretty much
covered this, didn't we?

54:25.075 --> 54:27.327
Okay, to paraphrase
the long and tedious subject

54:27.369 --> 54:30.621
that we just discussed,
I am a womanizer, okay?

54:30.622 --> 54:32.456
I like all different
types of women.

54:32.457 --> 54:33.707
I like the way that they smell.

54:33.708 --> 54:34.958
I like the way that they taste.

54:34.959 --> 54:36.210
I like the way that they fuck!

54:36.211 --> 54:37.669
The problem is I find it hard

54:37.670 --> 54:39.629
to stay loyal or honest
to one particular woman

54:39.630 --> 54:41.172
at one particular time.

54:41.173 --> 54:42.465
There, I said it.
Fine. Are you happy?

54:42.466 --> 54:44.552
Now why are you here?

54:46.595 --> 54:48.055
I don't know.

54:49.556 --> 54:52.392
I really don't know.

54:55.228 --> 54:57.771
Look, are you happy with... Tom?

54:57.772 --> 54:59.397
John? What the fuck
is his name again?

54:59.398 --> 55:00.732
Greg. Yeah, Greg.

55:00.733 --> 55:02.192
Aren't you happy with Greg?

55:02.193 --> 55:05.778
Yeah. I mean, yes, I am.

55:05.779 --> 55:06.779
Then why?

55:06.780 --> 55:07.864
I don't have an answer.

55:07.865 --> 55:09.990
I don't fucking know, all right?

55:09.991 --> 55:12.576
All right, Jesus.
No need to get hostile.

55:12.577 --> 55:14.578
I was just wondering,

55:14.579 --> 55:15.954
since we're in such
an honest mood here tonight,

55:15.955 --> 55:17.456
laying naked beside one another,

55:17.457 --> 55:19.624
just having shared the most
intimate of body fluids,

55:19.625 --> 55:22.836
I thought we could
just kind of... wshhhh,

55:22.837 --> 55:25.463
just get everything
out in the open.

55:25.464 --> 55:27.340
Look, we know why I'm
cheating on my girlfriend,

55:27.341 --> 55:28.466
because I'm a piece of shit.

55:28.467 --> 55:30.509
But at least I know what I am,

55:30.510 --> 55:32.469
and I'm honest
with myself about it.

55:32.470 --> 55:34.638
Yeah, unfortunately,
you're the only person

55:34.639 --> 55:37.141
you have the ability
to be honest to.

55:40.603 --> 55:42.003
It's only because
I'm compassionate.

55:44.064 --> 55:45.982
What the fuck are
you talking about?

55:45.983 --> 55:47.942
The only reason
that I lie to women

55:47.943 --> 55:49.568
is to protect them
from being hurt.

55:49.569 --> 55:51.278
Oh, my God!

55:51.279 --> 55:54.823
You drive me fucking crazy!

55:54.824 --> 55:57.117
I mean, it's just...
It's amazing to me

55:57.118 --> 56:00.370
how you can justify
your lying and womanizing

56:00.371 --> 56:03.040
by believing that you're
doing us women a favor.

56:03.082 --> 56:04.666
Like we couldn't
handle the truth.

56:04.667 --> 56:06.043
Well, could you?

56:06.085 --> 56:08.377
I don't know.

56:08.378 --> 56:11.922
But at least we wouldn't
end up with broken hearts.

56:11.923 --> 56:14.299
I mean, you think
you're doing us a favor?

56:14.300 --> 56:16.802
You think you're
being compassionate

56:16.803 --> 56:19.846
by letting us think
that we're the only ones?

56:19.847 --> 56:23.766
No, you're the one that's
fucking delusional, David.

56:23.767 --> 56:26.519
All you're doing
is delaying the process.

56:26.520 --> 56:27.979
Sneaking behind our backs,

56:27.980 --> 56:30.648
fucking anything with a
pair of tits and three holes,

56:30.649 --> 56:33.484
eventually making us look like
idiots, breaking our spirits.

56:33.485 --> 56:36.153
That is not
compassionate, David.

56:36.154 --> 56:38.113
That is fucking evil.

56:38.114 --> 56:39.489
Evil?

56:39.490 --> 56:41.491
Yeah, evil.

56:41.492 --> 56:42.826
And the sad thing is

56:42.827 --> 56:45.370
you can't even comprehend
why it's evil

56:45.371 --> 56:48.123
because you've never
had to feel anything.

56:49.374 --> 56:53.419
It must be so nice to be
as numb to the world as you,

56:53.420 --> 56:55.879
protected and sheltered
by your own shallowness.

56:55.880 --> 56:59.257
So much so that you don't
even realize what you're doing

56:59.258 --> 57:01.427
is downright wrong.

57:04.638 --> 57:05.848
You done?

57:09.309 --> 57:11.393
Why are you such an asshole?

57:11.394 --> 57:12.895
I don't know.

57:12.896 --> 57:15.230
It's a gift.

57:15.231 --> 57:16.899
No, it's just sad.

57:19.068 --> 57:22.070
I mean, I can't expect
you to understand

57:22.071 --> 57:23.030
what it feels like
to be heartbroken.

57:23.031 --> 57:24.906
You wanna know why?

57:24.907 --> 57:26.033
Why?

57:27.576 --> 57:29.036
'Cause you don't have a heart.

57:38.753 --> 57:41.212
By the way, I lied.

57:41.213 --> 57:44.382
It is small.

57:44.383 --> 57:46.801
<i>♪ And still I rise ♪</i>

57:46.802 --> 57:50.763
<i>♪ And still I rise ♪</i>

57:50.764 --> 57:53.307
<i>♪ Like the sun I'll shine ♪</i>

57:53.308 --> 57:56.185
<i>♪ Oh, and still I rise... ♪</i>

58:27.714 --> 58:29.549
Oh, yeah.

58:45.189 --> 58:48.190
Uh...

58:48.191 --> 58:51.402
What's your name again?

58:51.403 --> 58:52.444
Alanna.

58:52.445 --> 58:53.530
Ah.

58:55.406 --> 58:57.240
What was yours?

58:57.241 --> 58:58.450
Uh, Marco.

58:58.451 --> 58:59.577
Oh.

59:02.079 --> 59:02.830
It's nice to meet you again.

59:02.831 --> 59:04.290
Yes.

59:08.168 --> 59:10.587
You, too. R-Really.

59:13.298 --> 59:16.092
Where, uh... Where are you from?

59:17.176 --> 59:19.052
Arkansas. Huh?

59:19.053 --> 59:22.097
This little town
outside of Little Rock.

59:22.098 --> 59:25.183
Um... Little Rock?

59:25.184 --> 59:28.352
Yeah, it's one of the
bigger cities in Arkansas.

59:28.353 --> 59:30.646
Oh.

59:30.647 --> 59:33.650
No, no, never heard of it.

59:34.651 --> 59:37.486
Where are you from,
Mexico or something?

59:37.487 --> 59:40.155
Uh, well, I'm Spanish,
and, uh...

59:40.156 --> 59:42.407
I'm from Madrid.

59:42.408 --> 59:45.660
Is... What part
of Mexico is that in?

59:45.661 --> 59:48.163
Oh, no, it's... It's in Spain.

59:50.540 --> 59:53.667
I know, but isn't that
in Mexico?

59:53.668 --> 59:57.254
No, it's in Spain.

59:57.255 --> 59:59.548
It's a country?

59:59.549 --> 01:00:01.007
In Europe?

01:00:01.008 --> 01:00:04.469
Oh! Okay, like, by England.

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:06.638
Y-Yeah, kind of.

01:00:15.647 --> 01:00:19.483
What, um... What language
do they speak there?

01:00:19.484 --> 01:00:21.152
Spanish.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:25.154
I know, but isn't that
what they speak in, um...

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:28.574
In, uh... Mexico?

01:00:28.575 --> 01:00:29.825
Yes, but the language...

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.662
Uh, the language
originated in Spain.

01:00:34.956 --> 01:00:38.083
Are you sure?

01:00:38.084 --> 01:00:40.002
Yes, I'm positive.

01:00:42.713 --> 01:00:44.255
Yes. Positive.

01:00:44.256 --> 01:00:47.216
Hmm. See, 'cause I have a...

01:00:47.217 --> 01:00:48.593
I have a Mexican friend,

01:00:48.594 --> 01:00:50.387
and he speaks Spanish.

01:00:59.562 --> 01:01:02.730
So is tonight your first
night at the Spider Club?

01:01:02.731 --> 01:01:06.109
No. No, I've been there
quite a bit.

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:09.570
You? No, I'm there all the time.

01:01:09.571 --> 01:01:12.948
I'm surprised I've
never seen you there.

01:01:12.949 --> 01:01:14.909
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:01:24.585 --> 01:01:28.588
What's your favorite, uh...

01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:30.464
color?

01:01:30.465 --> 01:01:31.924
My favorite color.

01:01:31.925 --> 01:01:34.843
Um, I don't know. Gray, I guess.

01:01:34.844 --> 01:01:37.846
Oh, no, see, gray's not a color.

01:01:37.847 --> 01:01:40.432
Sure it is.

01:01:40.433 --> 01:01:43.101
I have a gray sweater.

01:01:43.102 --> 01:01:44.102
Oh.

01:01:45.979 --> 01:01:47.522
So what do you do?

01:01:47.523 --> 01:01:48.190
I'm an actor.

01:01:48.191 --> 01:01:49.690
Really?

01:01:49.691 --> 01:01:52.067
Yeah, well, an aspiring actor.

01:01:52.068 --> 01:01:54.653
Would I have seen you
in anything?

01:01:54.654 --> 01:01:57.656
Probably not, no. Oh.

01:01:57.657 --> 01:02:01.618
<i>Oh... Well, actually,
I was Cholo ♪3</i>

01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:03.369
<i>in an episodio of Oz one time.</i>

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:05.830
Oh, cool! Yeah.

01:02:05.831 --> 01:02:07.999
Yeah, my agent,
he says that, uh...

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.458
He says that things
are going to be

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.709
picking up for me very soon.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:11.752
Really?

01:02:11.753 --> 01:02:14.338
Well, he says I have
a unique quality

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:16.923
that sets me apart
from the pack.

01:02:16.924 --> 01:02:17.924
Hmm.

01:02:17.925 --> 01:02:19.342
It's only a matter
of time, he says,

01:02:19.343 --> 01:02:21.594
before I get my big break.

01:02:21.595 --> 01:02:23.304
Cool.

01:02:23.305 --> 01:02:25.932
He describes me
as the next, uh...

01:02:25.933 --> 01:02:27.266
the next Antonio Banderas.

01:02:27.267 --> 01:02:28.601
Oh, really? Yeah.

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:30.102
I love that guy.

01:02:30.103 --> 01:02:33.188
<i>I love Fantasy Island.</i>

01:02:33.189 --> 01:02:35.275
Oh, so good. Yeah.

01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:38.778
What do you do?

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.570
I'm a model.

01:02:40.571 --> 01:02:42.197
See, I would have guessed that.

01:02:42.198 --> 01:02:44.699
Really?

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.909
You look like a model.

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:49.036
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

01:02:49.037 --> 01:02:50.664
What kind of modeling do you do?

01:02:50.705 --> 01:02:53.749
Um...

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.459
Mostly print. Mm-hmm.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.879
Adult stuff, you know.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.880
Really? Yeah.

01:03:00.881 --> 01:03:03.174
Just for now, till I can find

01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:04.968
something better to do.

01:03:04.969 --> 01:03:07.387
Oh. It's cool.

01:03:11.057 --> 01:03:13.517
Would I have seen...
Seen you in something?

01:03:13.518 --> 01:03:17.020
<i>Maybe. Do you ever
pick up the L.A. Express?</i>

01:03:17.021 --> 01:03:18.897
That's, uh...

01:03:18.898 --> 01:03:21.066
That's the paper that
advertises for hookers.

01:03:21.067 --> 01:03:22.942
Uh... yeah.

01:03:22.943 --> 01:03:24.152
Call... Call girls or something?

01:03:24.153 --> 01:03:25.611
They're escorts.

01:03:25.612 --> 01:03:26.612
S-Sorry. Sorry.

01:03:27.948 --> 01:03:30.241
Actually, yeah. I've seen it...

01:03:30.242 --> 01:03:32.327
I've seen it a couple of times.

01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:42.335
I had... I had this...

01:03:42.336 --> 01:03:44.671
You are not a...

01:03:44.672 --> 01:03:46.506
you're not a professional,
though, are you?

01:03:46.507 --> 01:03:48.341
Yeah! What?

01:03:48.342 --> 01:03:51.510
Yeah, I'm an escort
from time to time.

01:03:51.511 --> 01:03:52.970
Why didn't you say something?

01:03:52.971 --> 01:03:56.181
'Cause you just
asked me right now.

01:03:56.182 --> 01:03:59.142
I mean, I just fucking
went down on you.

01:03:59.143 --> 01:04:01.102
Jesus Christ, don't you
think that's something

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.562
you should tell someone
before you...

01:04:02.563 --> 01:04:04.147
You sleep with them?

01:04:04.148 --> 01:04:06.816
No.

01:04:06.817 --> 01:04:09.193
You didn't tell me what you
did before you slept with me.

01:04:09.194 --> 01:04:10.319
That's different, okay?

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.447
I-I don't sleep with
random people for money.

01:04:14.032 --> 01:04:16.825
You're not upset, are you?

01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:19.620
A little bit.

01:04:20.705 --> 01:04:21.830
Oh, jeez.

01:04:21.831 --> 01:04:24.082
You don't have
something, do you?

01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:25.625
Like what?

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:27.126
Like a fucking
disease or something.

01:04:27.127 --> 01:04:28.961
No.

01:04:28.962 --> 01:04:32.215
No way. I make all
the guys wear condoms.

01:04:32.257 --> 01:04:33.258
It's my number one rule.

01:04:36.678 --> 01:04:38.053
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:38.054 --> 01:04:40.597
My fucking dong is going
to mush up and fall off.

01:04:40.598 --> 01:04:42.682
Come on, don't be angry.

01:04:42.683 --> 01:04:44.642
What were you doing
at the club tonight?

01:04:44.643 --> 01:04:48.229
Shouldn't you be out
working or something?

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:50.481
Silly. Escorts
like to party, too.

01:04:50.482 --> 01:04:53.359
Besides, it's a good place
to pick up work.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.819
Oh, my God.

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.738
You don't expect me
to pay for this, do you?

01:04:57.739 --> 01:05:00.324
No. I liked it.

01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:05.953
I like sex just like
the next person, you know?

01:05:05.954 --> 01:05:07.997
That's why I do what I do.

01:05:07.998 --> 01:05:11.917
Can we not... Let's not
talk about it, okay?

01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:13.669
Just be careful, yeah?

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:16.630
I don't know why you get
so uncomfortable about it.

01:05:16.631 --> 01:05:18.465
It's kinda cute.

01:05:18.466 --> 01:05:20.008
And you're for real, huh?

01:05:20.009 --> 01:05:22.927
Yeah, I mean, it's not like I
sleep with that many more men

01:05:22.928 --> 01:05:24.762
than every other
stupid girl at the club.

01:05:24.763 --> 01:05:27.473
I'm just smart enough
to get paid for it.

01:05:27.474 --> 01:05:28.392
But you're selling yourself.

01:05:28.393 --> 01:05:30.393
You're ashamed, no?

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:33.479
No. Why should I be?

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.356
I like what I do, and until
something more promising comes along,

01:05:36.357 --> 01:05:39.067
then I'm happy
getting paid to have sex.

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.736
I like to do the boopsy.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.030
Were you abused
as a child or something?

01:05:44.031 --> 01:05:45.991
No!

01:05:47.868 --> 01:05:49.910
How... How long have you
been doing this?

01:05:49.911 --> 01:05:51.954
Um... Right here.

01:05:51.955 --> 01:05:54.289
Since I moved here.

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:56.960
I was waiting tables,
and this guy made me an offer.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.087
And was he serious?

01:06:00.129 --> 01:06:01.921
Mm-hmm.

01:06:01.922 --> 01:06:04.966
Yep. He offered me a thousand
bucks to come home with him.

01:06:04.967 --> 01:06:07.510
Oh, Jesus. A thousand bucks.

01:06:07.511 --> 01:06:10.513
So I did it. Oh, he was so cute.

01:06:10.514 --> 01:06:11.972
And he was nice.

01:06:11.973 --> 01:06:14.099
I would have went home with him
for free if he would have asked,

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.351
but I figured I'd make me
some money, you know?

01:06:16.352 --> 01:06:18.520
Hmm.

01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:21.022
After that, you know,
I told my friend,

01:06:21.023 --> 01:06:22.690
and we both decided
to quit waiting tables

01:06:22.691 --> 01:06:24.567
and do it for a living.

01:06:24.568 --> 01:06:27.028
Not too bad. It's honest work.

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:29.196
I offer a service
and I get my rocks off

01:06:29.197 --> 01:06:32.283
in the meantime, so it
works out for everyone.

01:06:32.284 --> 01:06:33.909
Ooh!

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:34.910
I'm home, honey!

01:06:38.206 --> 01:06:39.206
Jesus.

01:06:42.835 --> 01:06:44.877
Uh, don't you come across
the scumbags, huh?

01:06:44.878 --> 01:06:48.381
Sometimes, but...

01:06:48.382 --> 01:06:50.549
that's where this comes in.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:52.551
Oh, Jesus! Okay.

01:06:52.552 --> 01:06:54.970
What, don't they have
guns in Mexico?

01:06:54.971 --> 01:06:56.638
Mexico, they're all
about the guns,

01:06:56.639 --> 01:06:57.681
but in Spain, no.

01:06:57.682 --> 01:07:00.141
Okay... be careful
with that, huh?

01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:02.727
Don't be scared.
I know how to handle a gun.

01:07:02.728 --> 01:07:04.938
I've been shooting
since I was six.

01:07:04.939 --> 01:07:07.315
Okay, uh...

01:07:07.316 --> 01:07:09.066
Put it... Put it in the bag.

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:11.777
Zip, zip, zip, zip,
zip it in the bag, okay?

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:12.779
Put it away.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.573
Aw, you're scared.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:18.241
Anyway, I try not
to worry too much,

01:07:18.242 --> 01:07:19.951
'cause I'm a pretty, uh...

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:24.122
I'm a pretty good judge
of character, you know?

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:25.832
Hey!

01:07:25.833 --> 01:07:28.709
I trusted you, didn't I?

01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:30.628
Ay.

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:32.630
Anyhoo,

01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:36.383
I don't worry too much.

01:07:36.384 --> 01:07:37.843
I do what I want to do,

01:07:37.844 --> 01:07:40.637
and if I'm not
feeling it, I don't.

01:07:40.638 --> 01:07:42.430
Oy.

01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:44.265
Are you all right?

01:07:44.266 --> 01:07:47.768
Oy, I... I don't know.

01:07:47.769 --> 01:07:50.104
Hey, look, don't let it
bother you, okay?

01:07:50.105 --> 01:07:51.772
I promise, I am clean.

01:07:51.773 --> 01:07:54.274
I use protection.

01:07:54.275 --> 01:07:56.068
Look, I'm just
a normal person like you

01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:57.903
except for I get paid to fuck.

01:07:57.904 --> 01:07:59.279
Okay, okay.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.072
Could you please stop
saying that, yes?

01:08:01.073 --> 01:08:03.700
What are you doing in there?

01:08:03.701 --> 01:08:06.202
I... I'm cleaning up.

01:08:06.203 --> 01:08:07.787
Okay.

01:08:07.788 --> 01:08:09.748
Oy.

01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:17.587
How... How old were you
when you first had the sex?

01:08:19.924 --> 01:08:21.634
12.

01:08:24.345 --> 01:08:25.970
Yes... Yes, 12. Okay.

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:27.220
Um...

01:08:27.221 --> 01:08:30.140
12? Yeah, 12.

01:08:30.142 --> 01:08:32.393
Okay. With... With who?

01:08:32.394 --> 01:08:35.062
Uh, my Uncle Danny.

01:08:35.063 --> 01:08:36.979
You fucked with
your Uncle Danny?

01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:39.149
Yeah, but I thought
it was my cousin.

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:42.527
Oh... Oh, Jesus.

01:08:42.528 --> 01:08:44.569
What can I say?
It was dark in my room.

01:08:44.571 --> 01:08:47.823
Okay, but you thought
it was your cousin.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:48.908
Yeah, well, me and my cousin,

01:08:48.908 --> 01:08:51.327
we've always fooled around.

01:08:51.328 --> 01:08:55.037
Why...
I told you I was from Arkansas.

01:08:55.038 --> 01:08:57.499
What is that supposed to mean?

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.417
It's just it's not that
uncommon of a thing, that's all.

01:09:00.419 --> 01:09:01.504
At least it wasn't my dad.

01:09:02.712 --> 01:09:04.339
What the fu... Oh, God.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.006
This is... This is
too much for me.

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:08.884
Calm down.
It was a long time ago.

01:09:08.885 --> 01:09:10.886
No, no, everything.

01:09:10.886 --> 01:09:13.889
First, you're a girl who's
laying in bed next to me,

01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:16.475
and then you're an escort
who's laying in bed next to me.

01:09:16.475 --> 01:09:18.727
Now you're an escort
who fucked her uncle

01:09:18.728 --> 01:09:19.978
who she thought was her cousin

01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:21.438
is laying in bed next to me!

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.064
This is too fucked for me!

01:09:23.064 --> 01:09:24.064
Relax.

01:09:25.274 --> 01:09:26.734
Relax.

01:09:26.777 --> 01:09:28.653
What is it? Relax? Huh, relax?

01:09:28.654 --> 01:09:29.737
You want me to relax?

01:09:29.738 --> 01:09:31.071
How the fuck am I
supposed to relax?

01:09:31.072 --> 01:09:32.573
I don't even know
who the fuck you are,

01:09:32.573 --> 01:09:36.158
and I just put my dick inside
you for... over an hour.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.618
Well, maybe you
should think twice

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.120
before you take a stranger home

01:09:39.121 --> 01:09:40.455
and have sex with her.

01:09:40.456 --> 01:09:42.040
You know, look at you.

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:45.042
You don't even realize how incredibly
fucked the situation is, huh?

01:09:45.044 --> 01:09:46.961
Why don't you just relax?
You'll get over it.

01:09:46.962 --> 01:09:51.506
No. No, I will not
get over it, okay?

01:09:51.508 --> 01:09:56.053
Having sex with an escort
is not something I get over.

01:09:56.054 --> 01:09:59.514
I have never paid
for the sex in my life.

01:09:59.515 --> 01:10:02.100
I already said this one
was on the house.

01:10:02.101 --> 01:10:04.852
You don't get it, do you, huh?

01:10:04.853 --> 01:10:06.813
Come on.

01:10:06.814 --> 01:10:08.731
Relax. Didn't we have fun?

01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:10.232
I thought we were having fun.

01:10:10.233 --> 01:10:12.651
Did you really fuck your uncle?

01:10:12.652 --> 01:10:15.696
Yes, but I told you
I thought it was my cousin.

01:10:15.697 --> 01:10:16.947
Oh, God! Why, why...

01:10:16.948 --> 01:10:18.615
Why do you keep saying that

01:10:18.616 --> 01:10:20.283
like it's supposed to
make me feel better, huh?

01:10:20.284 --> 01:10:22.118
Well, doesn't it?

01:10:22.119 --> 01:10:24.871
I mean, what if I fucked
my uncle knowingly?

01:10:24.872 --> 01:10:27.039
Now that's gross.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.624
You are twisted, you know that?

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:32.753
No, I'm not twisted.
I'm honest, okay?

01:10:32.754 --> 01:10:35.088
I mean, most girls
would have lied.

01:10:35.089 --> 01:10:37.758
If you had asked them what they did
for a living, they would have lied.

01:10:37.759 --> 01:10:39.384
They would have said
they were a runway model

01:10:39.385 --> 01:10:41.928
for Gucci or Dolce
or some bullshit.

01:10:41.929 --> 01:10:44.597
I'm not ashamed
of what I am, okay?

01:10:44.598 --> 01:10:46.307
Just 'cause you got
your hang-ups,

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:48.517
don't take them out
on me, Buster Brown.

01:10:48.518 --> 01:10:51.937
Buster Brown?

01:10:51.938 --> 01:10:54.606
Buster? What... What...

01:10:54.607 --> 01:10:55.608
What is this Buster...

01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:57.109
You are the craziest person

01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.403
I've ever met
in my life, you know?

01:11:02.323 --> 01:11:04.617
You got another round in you?

01:11:04.658 --> 01:11:07.119
Another round?

01:11:09.121 --> 01:11:11.664
What... What was that?
What was that?

01:11:11.665 --> 01:11:12.957
You got another round in you?

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.416
Another round, huh?

01:11:14.417 --> 01:11:16.043
Are you completely oblivious

01:11:16.044 --> 01:11:18.671
to everything that's just
taken place here, huh?

01:11:21.048 --> 01:11:22.048
What is this?

01:11:22.049 --> 01:11:24.717
What the fuck is so funny, huh?

01:11:24.718 --> 01:11:25.968
What is so... What is so funny?

01:11:25.969 --> 01:11:29.096
What...

01:11:29.097 --> 01:11:30.389
You don't laugh at me!

01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:31.390
You come into my house...
Just relax!

01:11:31.391 --> 01:11:33.226
I was just fucking with you.

01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:36.937
What?

01:11:36.938 --> 01:11:38.355
I was fucking with you.

01:11:38.356 --> 01:11:40.148
I'm not an fucking escort.

01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:42.317
What? What is this?

01:11:42.318 --> 01:11:43.152
You're... You're not an escort?

01:11:43.153 --> 01:11:44.944
No.

01:11:44.945 --> 01:11:47.989
Are you serious? Yeah!

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:52.118
You should have seen your face
when I said I fucked my uncle!

01:11:56.414 --> 01:12:00.166
Your... Your eyes,
like, bugged out.

01:12:00.167 --> 01:12:01.876
Okay, wait, wait,
All of this, this is...

01:12:01.877 --> 01:12:04.295
It was bullshit.

01:12:04.296 --> 01:12:05.672
It was complete bullshit.

01:12:05.673 --> 01:12:07.465
The gun. What about the gun?

01:12:07.466 --> 01:12:09.967
What about the gun?

01:12:09.968 --> 01:12:11.386
This is...

01:12:13.263 --> 01:12:14.930
It's a lighter.

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.140
You... It's a fucking lighter.

01:12:17.141 --> 01:12:18.934
You're pulling... You're
pulling my chain, eh?

01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:20.895
No, I'm serious. Look.

01:12:28.068 --> 01:12:29.318
Okay, this...

01:12:29.319 --> 01:12:31.403
I mean, it's bad...
It's bad enough

01:12:31.404 --> 01:12:33.322
that you're being a hooker,

01:12:33.323 --> 01:12:35.282
but the whole "fucking
your uncle," that's...

01:12:35.283 --> 01:12:36.575
I know. It's so fucked.

01:12:36.576 --> 01:12:38.368
That's just fucking disturbing.

01:12:38.369 --> 01:12:39.870
This is a... This is a lighter?

01:12:39.871 --> 01:12:41.038
You're not an escort, huh?

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.747
No. But I mean, come on,

01:12:42.748 --> 01:12:44.875
would it have all
really mattered, though?

01:12:44.917 --> 01:12:45.667
I mean...

01:12:45.668 --> 01:12:48.837
Yeah, I think... Yes, I...

01:12:50.088 --> 01:12:51.715
So...

01:12:51.756 --> 01:12:54.426
what... what do you
really do, huh?

01:12:57.929 --> 01:12:59.430
I'm an actress.

01:13:03.267 --> 01:13:05.352
