male announcer: ON THE LAST
EPISODE OF <i> INKMASTER,</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.215
FUELED BY BAD BLOOD,

00:07.298 --> 00:11.136
17 ARTISTS
FOUGHT TO SETTLE THE SCORE.

00:11.219 --> 00:14.848
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,
HOT MODELS BROUGHT THE HEAT.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.224
- I LOVE NAKED MODELS.
[chuckles]

00:16.306 --> 00:17.642
- IT'S PROBABLY ONE
OF MY FAVORITE CHALLENGES.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.018
- YOU JUST NEVER SHUT UP.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.438
- I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU.

00:21.521 --> 00:26.109
announcer: AND AN UNEXPECTED
TWIST SENT THE ARTISTS SPINNING.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.902
- USING THE MODEL YOU JUST
PAINTED AS YOUR REFERENCE,

00:27.986 --> 00:34.617
YOU MUST ALL TATTOO A PIN-UP.
- WHAT?

00:34.701 --> 00:37.078
announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION
TATTOO, THE ARTISTS

00:37.162 --> 00:38.747
BUCKLED UNDER THE PRESSURE.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.832
- THIS GUY
IS PERMANENTLY [bleep] UP

00:40.915 --> 00:42.250
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.294
YOU CAN'T DO
A [bleep]-UP FACE

00:44.377 --> 00:46.254
AND A [bleep]-UP HAND
AND A WEIRD-ASS

00:46.337 --> 00:49.132
POSE AND THEN SAY, "OH,
MY CLIENT MESSED IT ALL UP."

00:49.215 --> 00:50.592
- [bleep] YOU BOTH.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.845
- I SINCERELY HOPE THIS IS NOT
EVERYBODY'S BEST WORK.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.764
- TRUST ME, I KNOW BETTER.
- SO THEN KNOW BETTER.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.640
MAN, THIS NEEDS TO BE
THE WAKE-UP CALL.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.768
IF YOU CAN'T STACK UP,
THEN GET READY TO GO HOME.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.105
announcer: AND THE BROTHERS'
RIVALRY EXPLODED.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.983
- STOP POINTING THE FINGER AT ME
AND TELLING ME HOW [bleep] I AM.

01:07.066 --> 01:08.359
- BITCH-ASS LIAR.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.819
YOU MOTHER[bleep].

01:09.903 --> 01:11.154
THAT PIECE OF [bleep]

01:11.237 --> 01:14.282
[bleep] ACTS
LIKE I'M THE [bleep] BAD GUY

01:14.365 --> 01:16.701
WHEN I JUST WANT
TO [bleep] FIX IT!

01:16.785 --> 01:18.203
announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION,

01:18.286 --> 01:19.829
LT, ROBBIE,

01:19.913 --> 01:22.081
AND TIM WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.875
- ROBBIE, THIS THING'S
LIKE A ALIEN WITH A HUGE EYE

01:23.958 --> 01:26.377
AND THE LITTLE FEET.
- TIM.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.379
- THAT ONE HAND
THAT'S UP ON THE FRET BOARD,

01:28.463 --> 01:29.506
THAT [bleep] IS CRAZY.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.716
- KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A PAW.
- LT.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.426
- THAT'S A BIG-ASS MOUTH
SHE GOT.

01:33.510 --> 01:37.013
THE SMALLEST LITTLE MISTAKE
MAKES A BIG IMPACT.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.600
- LT, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INKMASTER.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.396
announcer: 16 ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:45.480 --> 01:50.360
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN
A $100,000 PRIZE

01:50.443 --> 01:52.612
AND THE TITLE OF INKMASTER.

LT HANGING ON.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.340

03:12.692 --> 03:14.777
- IT WAS, UM--
IT WAS CRAZY, MAN.

03:14.861 --> 03:16.362
- ROBBIE, YOU'VE BEEN
TATTOOING A LONG TIME,

03:16.446 --> 03:17.113
BUT IF I WAS STANDING
IN YOUR SHOES,

03:17.196 --> 03:18.948
I WOULDN'T FEEL SAFE.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.283

- TO ME,

03:22.160 --> 03:23.828
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
THAT HE DOES EVERY DAY.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.580
IT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME
THAT HE WAS HERE.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.999
MAYBE HE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
CALLING ME A [bleep] ARTIST

03:28.082 --> 03:29.250
ALL THE TIME.

03:30.543 --> 03:34.005
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
DID A PERFECT TATTOO.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.924
{\an8}- JAYVO GETS IN MY HEAD
SO MUCH.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.426
{\an8}HE'S REALLY PUTTING A LOT
OF MENTAL WARFARE ON ME.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.595
HIS FALSE
DELUSIONAL CONFIDENCE

03:40.678 --> 03:42.931
IS MAKING ME FEEL
LIKE I DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.308
YOU KNOW WHAT, BRO?

03:45.391 --> 03:47.977
YOU MAKE IT REAL [bleep] EASY
TO NOT WANT TO BE NICE.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.395
- YOU WERE
ON THE BOTTOM,

03:49.479 --> 03:51.814
AND NOW YOU WANT TO COME HERE
AND GANG UP ON ME?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.107
- I DIDN'T GANG UP ON YOU.
I KNOW I WAS ON THE BOTTOM.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.984
- DUDE, YOU JUST SAID YOU WANTED
TO LET GO OF THE GRUDGE,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.319
BUT EVERY TIME
SOME [bleep]

03:56.402 --> 03:58.696
COMES UP, YOU BRING UP
THE SAME [bleep] STUFF.

03:58.780 --> 03:59.989
- "YOU WERE ON THE BOTTOM."
YOU GO

04:00.073 --> 04:01.115
AND START TALKING [bleep]
TO ME AGAIN?

04:01.199 --> 04:02.241
- HOW DID I TALK [bleep]?

04:02.325 --> 04:04.994
YOU JUST STARTED IT.
- OH, MY GOD.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.412
THIS IS [bleep] RIDICULOUS.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.348
- WELCOME, ARTISTS.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.685
SO FAR, TWO OF YOU
HAVE DEFEATED YOUR RIVALS.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.186
THIS WEEK, THE REST OF YOU

04:30.269 --> 04:33.398
HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE TO PROVE
THAT YOU ARE THE BETTER ARTIST

04:33.481 --> 04:35.692
AND SEND YOUR RIVAL PACKING.

04:35.775 --> 04:40.071
IN THE END, ONE OF YOU
WILL WALK AWAY WITH $100,000,

04:40.154 --> 04:41.072
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

04:41.155 --> 04:43.282
AND THE TITLE OF INKMASTER.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.534
THIS WEEK, WE'RE TESTING A SKILL

04:44.617 --> 04:47.537
THAT'S A FOUNDATION
OF A STRONG TATTOO--

04:47.620 --> 04:51.290
LINES.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.751
{\an8}- LINES IN A TATTOO
ARE THE SKELETON OF YOUR TATTOO,

04:53.835 --> 04:56.212
{\an8}THE BASE.

04:56.295 --> 04:58.965
WITHOUT LINES IN A TATTOO, THEY
JUST KIND OF LOOK WISHY-WASHY,

04:59.048 --> 05:01.175
ESPECIALLY AFTER TIME.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.427
- FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE,

05:02.510 --> 05:05.346
YOU ONLY HAVE LINES
TO CREATE YOUR DESIGN.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.889
USING MATCH TAPE,

05:06.973 --> 05:10.310
YOU MUST CREATE A LINE DESIGN
ON AN 8-FOOT BY 8-FOOT CANVAS.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.769
WHEN THE TIME IS UP,

05:11.853 --> 05:14.022
THE MATCH TAPE WILL IGNITE
AND PERMANENTLY BURN YOUR DESIGN

05:14.105 --> 05:16.149
INTO YOUR CANVAS.

05:16.232 --> 05:19.861
AND YOU MUST WORK
IN TEAMS OF TWO.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.447
- DAMN.
- IT [bleep] SUCKS

05:22.530 --> 05:23.740
TO HAVE A TEAMMATE.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.243
{\an8}I DON'T WANT MY FATE
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HANDS.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.787

YOU WON THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.915
{\an8}IT'S UP TO YOU
TO ASSIGN THE TEAMS.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.126
{\an8}- I HAVE THE FIRST SKULL PICK
OF THIS COMPETITION,

05:35.209 --> 05:36.711
{\an8}AND I KNOW
HOW TO USE IT.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.588
{\an8}- JOSH IS AN EGOMANIACAL
CRAZY PERSON.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.007
{\an8}I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL
AS HE'S SLAMMING THESE SKULLS

05:41.090 --> 05:43.217
{\an8}INTO PEOPLE'S HANDS

05:43.301 --> 05:45.511
{\an8}THAT HE'S ENJOYING
EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.805
{\an8}- OUT OF ALL THE RIVALS HERE,
NOBODY CAN STAND EACH OTHER,

05:47.889 --> 05:49.474
{\an8}SO I'M GONNA PUT THEM TOGETHER
AND SEE A [bleep] STORM.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.271
- ARTISTS, ONE BY ONE,

05:55.354 --> 05:57.440
PLEASE READ THE NUMBER
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL

05:57.523 --> 05:58.691
TO DETERMINE YOUR TEAM.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.193
- SIX.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.236
- TWO.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.404
- THREE.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.239
- THREE.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.909
- TWO.
- [bleep].

06:07.992 --> 06:10.286
- FOUR.
- FOUR.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.288
{\an8}I GET PAIRED
WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.706
COLLABORATING WITH ROBBIE
IS GONNA SUCK.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.833
- SIX.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.627
- FIVE.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.128
- FIVE.
- [bleep].

06:19.212 --> 06:20.713
{\an8}- I KNEW HE WAS GONNA
STICK ME WITH THIS GUY.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.383
{\an8}JOSH IS GUNNING FOR ME BECAUSE
HE SEES THAT I'M A THREAT.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.928
- EIGHT.
- EIGHT.

06:27.011 --> 06:29.430
- SEVEN.
- LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.973
- ONE.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.476
- NUMBER ONE.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.268
- YOU HAVE 90 MINUTES,

06:34.352 --> 06:37.814
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.195
{\an8}- YOU'RE NOT A GOOD TATTOO
ARTIST TO BE IN THIS COMPETITION

06:44.278 --> 06:47.365
{\an8}IF YOU CAN'T DO
A STRAIGHT LINE.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.699
OUR JOB IS BASED

06:48.783 --> 06:50.493
AND PREDICATED ON GOING
LIKE THIS OR GOING LIKE THIS.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.788
IF YOU CAN'T DO
EITHER OF THOSE THINGS PROPERLY,

06:53.871 --> 06:54.831
YOU NEED TO GO LIKE THIS.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.753
- WHENEVER YOU DO,
DON'T TRY TO RUB IT, PAT IT.

07:00.837 --> 07:01.963
I WAS AN EXPLOSIVES EXPERT
IN THE MILITARY.

07:02.046 --> 07:05.133
{\an8}WE USED MATCH TAPE TO START
CERTAIN EXPLOSIVE FIRES.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.551
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT BURNS.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.262
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES,
THE KINDS OF LINES IT LEAVES.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.847
{\an8}- OW.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.598
- I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA
HAVE AN UPPER HAND.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.102
- DUDE, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
JUST CUT ME OUT,

07:16.185 --> 07:17.353
LIKE, 2-FOOT STRIPS.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.355
I DEFINITELY DON'T TRUST JOSH
AS A PERSON.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.941
{\an8}I MEAN, HE'S A FLIP-FLOPPING
MOTHER[bleep], THIS GUY, OKAY?

07:22.024 --> 07:23.776
- GOING LIKE, WHRRR.
- WELL, I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE--

07:23.860 --> 07:25.194
- YEAH, COME BACK
AND LOOK AT IT

07:25.278 --> 07:26.487
AND SEE IT UP CLOSE.
- MORE LIKE--MORE LIKE THAT.

07:26.571 --> 07:27.864
BUT I DO KNOW HIS STRENGTHS
AND HIS WEAKNESSES.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.575
IN A CHALLENGE LIKE THIS,
HE'S THE DEVIL I KNOW.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.502
- WE'LL GO 5.
- DON'T [bleep] UP.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.671
- DUDE, 5 IS GOOD.
- DUDE, ALL RIGHT.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.923
JUST DON'T DO [bleep] TOO MUCH.
WE GOT TO GET THIS DONE.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.633
{\an8}JAYVO HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A CAR PAINTER.

07:47.717 --> 07:48.843
{\an8}HE GOT ME
INTO CUSTOMIZING CARS.

07:48.926 --> 07:50.469
I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT
THAT HE'S GONNA BE

07:50.553 --> 07:53.639
ABLE TO PUT DOWN
A REALLY STRONG LINE DESIGN.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.058
THERE'S MORE SPACE
BETWEEN THESE TWO

07:56.142 --> 07:57.560
THAN THERE IS THESE TWO.
- THAT'S FINE.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.895
THIS ONE CAN BE BIGGER.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.980
AS LONG AS IT'S CONSISTENT
WITH ITSELF.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.899
- I WANT HIM ON MY TEAM
NOW, ODDLY ENOUGH.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.193
- 15 MINUTES.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.486
15 MINUTES LEFT.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.241
- I THINK YOU WENT
A LITTLE TOO BIG.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.577
I THINK YOU PUT A LITTLE MUCH
[bleep] FLAIR IN THESE WINGS.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.412
{\an8}- ANGEL'S ALWAYS
HAMMERING ME DOWN.

08:16.495 --> 08:19.373
{\an8}HE TRIES TO TAKE CONTROL
OF EVERYTHING THAT I'M DOING.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.209
{\an8}IF I DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT,
THEN YOU DO IT YOURSELF.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.716
{\an8}- OH, MAN.

08:28.799 --> 08:32.010
{\an8}I JUST CAN'T GET THIS MATCH TAPE
TO LINE UP RIGHT.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.933
{\an8}I'M WORRIED ABOUT
THIS WHOLE THING BLOWING OUT

08:37.015 --> 08:38.808
{\an8}AND THAT CIRCLE
TURNING INTO A BLOB.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.649
{\an8}- I HAVE NO CLUE

08:44.732 --> 08:46.192
{\an8}WHAT THIS IS GONNA LOOK LIKE
WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE.

08:46.275 --> 08:47.610
{\an8}- THE POINT WAS TO SHOW OFF
YOUR LINE WORK.

08:49.654 --> 08:53.366
- ONCE THIS IS LIT
AND IT GOES UP IN FLAMES,

08:53.449 --> 08:54.617
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.118
THERE'S NO CHANGING,
NO EDITING.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.704
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.581
- FIVE, FOUR,

09:00.665 --> 09:04.502
THREE, TWO, ONE.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.754
THAT IS IT.
TIME IS UP.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.012
- YEAH.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.640
- WHOO!

09:17.723 --> 09:17.807
- WOW.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.440
- YEAH.
[applause]

09:26.524 --> 09:28.859
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS.
IT'S TIME TO CRITIQUE YOUR WORK.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.237
DON AND ERIK,
TELL US WHAT YOUR PLAN HERE WAS.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.406
- I FIGURED GUNPOWDER,
MAKE A FIRE.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.116
- FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,
IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO TELL

09:35.199 --> 09:35.992
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IT.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.494
DEFINITELY HAS
THAT RIGID TAPE,

09:38.577 --> 09:41.038
STRAIGHT LINE LOOK THAT TAKES
AWAY FROM THE FLAME IMAGE.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.374
- CRIS AND ANGEL.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.168
IT'S AN EAGLE, CORRECT?
- YES.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.837
- I DON'T THINK
IT'S AN EAGLE.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.089
THERE'S A LOT OF MISSED
OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS DESIGN

09:50.172 --> 09:51.507
TO SHOW A LOT
MORE DETAIL.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.842
- YOU NEED TO TAKE THESE THINGS
AS SERIOUS AS YOU CAN.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.679
THE ADVANTAGE THAT YOU MIGHT WIN
WILL GIVE YOU A POSITION

09:56.762 --> 09:59.432
TO SHOW OFF
IN THE NEXT ELIMINATION.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.933
NOW YOU'RE LOOKING
AT GETTING ELIMINATED

10:01.017 --> 10:02.852
ON DOING A SILLY BIRD.

10:02.935 --> 10:03.936
- TIM AND CLEEN.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.896
- THERE ARE A LOT
OF INCONSISTENCIES

10:05.980 --> 10:06.939
THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.024
IT'S NOT REALLY SYMMETRICAL.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.193
IF YOU LOOK
AT THAT BOTTOM CORNERSTONE

10:11.277 --> 10:13.112
AND THEN LOOK
AT THE RIGHT BOTTOM CORNER,

10:13.195 --> 10:15.364
THOSE ARE NOT EQUAL.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.283
- ROBBIE AND JAYVO.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.242
- YEAH, THIS IS A GREAT JOB,
GUYS.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.493
IT'S READABLE.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.620
IT'S VERY CLEAN.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.121
EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE
HOPING TO SEE.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.581
{\an8}- ROBBIE THINKS
HE'S A BETTER ARTIST THAN ME

10:23.664 --> 10:25.249
{\an8}BECAUSE HE'S BEEN
DOING IT LONGER.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.125
BUT TODAY,
HE LET ME TAKE THE LEAD,

10:26.208 --> 10:30.421
AND WE DID A GREAT JOB.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.630
- JASON AND JOSH.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.508
- THIS DRAWING IS PITIFUL.
THE KOI FISH IS

10:34.592 --> 10:36.594
THE LEAST OUT-OF-THE-BOX THING
YOU COULD HAVE COME UP WITH.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.554
- THE WATER FLOWS,
AND YOU HAVE OTHER IMAGERY

10:38.637 --> 10:40.431
TO LOOK AT OTHER
THAN JUST ONE IMAGE.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.766
- I MEAN,
IT'S AN UGLY KOI.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.769
YOU TOOK YOURSELF
OUT OF THE HUNT.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.228
- MARK AND RYAN.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.065
- I THINK IT HAS A LOT
OF DYNAMIC ARRANGEMENT TO IT.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.816
IT'S A COOL MANDALA DESIGN
IN THERE.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.402
BITS AND ARROWS
BRINGING EVERYTHING TO IT

10:53.486 --> 10:54.612
AS A FOCAL POINT.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.322
GOOD JOB.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.075
- EMILY AND AARON,
HOW WAS IT TEAMING UP AS RIVALS?

10:59.158 --> 11:00.534
- HE SUCKS
AS A HUMAN BEING,

11:00.618 --> 11:03.579
BUT WE WORK TOGETHER
FAIRLY WELL, SURPRISINGLY.

11:03.662 --> 11:05.331
- THE EFFICIENCY YOU HAD TO BE
ABLE TO GET THIS MANY LINES

11:05.414 --> 11:07.792
AND USE THE ENTIRE CANVAS,

11:07.875 --> 11:10.002
I COULDN'T SEE A RIVALRY
IN THIS IF I WANTED TO.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.922
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- YOU GOT IT.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.258
- TY'ESHA AND JULIA,
IT'S A LITTLE UNDERWHELMING.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.637
- IT SHOWS A LACK OF CREATIVITY,
ESPECIALLY WITH THE FUSE LINE

11:19.720 --> 11:21.389
COMING OFF THE BOTTOM
OF THE TIP LIKE THAT.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.057
THAT LINE MAKES NO SENSE.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.141
IF YOU WOULD HAVE HAD
A ROPE COMING

11:24.225 --> 11:25.726
OFF THE TOP
OF THE ANCHOR,

11:25.810 --> 11:27.353
AT LEAST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PART
OF THE IMAGE THAT MADE SENSE.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.687
- WE WERE WORRIED
ABOUT IT FUZZING IN TOO MUCH,

11:28.771 --> 11:29.772
SO WE DIDN'T WANT
THIS--

11:29.855 --> 11:31.273
- SO A LINE OFF THE TOP

11:31.357 --> 11:33.150
THAT MAYBE WOULD HAVE POSSIBLY
LOOKED LIKE A ROPE ON THE ANCHOR

11:33.234 --> 11:37.071
WORRIED YOU MORE THAN THIS
SENSELESS LINE AT THE BOTTOM?

11:37.154 --> 11:38.489
- YEAH.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.407
- THERE'S AN ENTIRE CANVAS
FOR YOU TO USE.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.118
{\an8}BRANCH OUT, BABY GIRLS.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.328
IT WOULD BE A LOT NICER
TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

11:44.412 --> 11:46.455
OF COMPETITION
IN THE HOUSE BETWEEN THE WOMEN.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.624
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU
WANT TO ROLL OVER AND DIE,

11:48.707 --> 11:48.791
THAT WORKS, TOO.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.463
- TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE,
LINES.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.132
BOTTOM OF THE DAY,
ANGEL AND CRIS,

11:56.215 --> 11:58.384
THEY CAME UP
WITH THE EAGLE-LIKE BIRD.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.552
- IT JUST LOOKS JUVENILE.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.553
SOMETHING THAT A FOURTH GRADER
COULD DRAW.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.139
- JULIA AND TY'ESHA.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.266
- JUST DID A SMALL,
LITTLE ANCHOR IN THE MIDDLE.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.268
WE'RE NOT IMPRESSED.
- THE TWO TEAMS FOR ME

12:07.351 --> 12:10.312
THAT REALLY SHINED
THE MOST WERE JAYVO AND ROBBIE

12:10.396 --> 12:12.148
AND AARON AND EMILY.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.316
THE PIECE THAT EMILY
AND AARON CAME UP WITH,

12:14.400 --> 12:15.317
THEY USED THE WHOLE CANVAS.

12:15.401 --> 12:16.444
THEY USED IT WELL.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.320
I THINK IT PAID OFF.
- ROBBIE AND JAYVO.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.865
- IT WAS VERY READABLE,
VERY CLEAN, VERY SYMMETRICAL.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.491
A GREAT EXAMPLE
OF WHAT TO DO.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.659
- IT SOUNDS
LIKE WE HAVE A DECISION.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.119
- YEAH.
- LET'S LET THEM KNOW.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.039
TODAY, YOU HAD TO WORK
IN TEAMS

12:29.123 --> 12:33.377
USING ONLY LINES TO CREATE
A DESIGN ON YOUR CANVAS.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.547
SOME OF YOU
CREATED IMPRESSIVE WORK.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.215
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.967
THE WINNERS OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE ARE...

12:45.890 --> 12:47.892
EMILY AND AARON.

12:47.975 --> 12:49.351
- YOU COVERED A LOT OF SPACE,

12:49.435 --> 12:50.936
AND IT REALLY DIDN'T SHOW
LIKE THERE WAS A RIVALRY

12:51.020 --> 12:52.354
ON THE ENTIRE CANVAS.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.647
- EMILY AND AARON,

12:53.731 --> 12:56.650
YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

12:56.734 --> 12:59.737
AT THE ELIMINATION
TATTOO TOGETHER.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.447
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT
AND PREPARE TO MEET

13:01.530 --> 13:04.658
YOUR CANVASES
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.328
- FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO PICK
AND CHOOSE WHO GETS WHAT CANVAS,

13:07.411 --> 13:09.872
MUSIC TO MY EARS.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.042
EVERYBODY AROUND ME SHOULD BE
PRETTY NERVOUS RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.879
{\an8}- I WOULD LIKE A MANDALA
IN MY ARMPIT.

13:16.962 --> 13:17.880
{\an8}- [bleep].

13:17.963 --> 13:18.797
{\an8}- YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST STOP
TALKING.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.716
{\an8}- [bleep]
YOU, MOTHER[bleep].

13:20.799 --> 13:23.302
COME HERE.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.061
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA DO WITH THEM SKULLS?

13:32.144 --> 13:34.271
YOU GUYS GONNA, LIKE,
START MAKING ENEMIES AND STUFF?

13:34.355 --> 13:35.397
- MAYBE.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.732
- WHO ARE YOU GONNA SCREW?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.943
- THROW IT TO THE ONE
THAT YOU THINK SHOULD GO HOME

13:39.026 --> 13:41.654
THE FASTEST AND WATCH
THEM ROLL DOWN THE ROAD.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.030
- SOME PEOPLE
ARE JUST GONNA

13:43.113 --> 13:44.782
HANG THEMSELVES NO MATTER
WHAT YOU GIVE THEM.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.408
- ARE YOU SHOOTING AT TIM?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.910
- I COULD GIVE THE EASIEST ONE
TO TIM, AND HE'D STILL BLOW IT.

13:47.993 --> 13:51.038
- I TOTALLY,
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.373
- OH, YOU THINK SO, TOO?
- WOW.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.499
- YOU THINK HE'S
THE WEAK LINK HERE?

13:53.582 --> 13:54.833
- OF COURSE HE IS.
- OOH.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.085
- YOU AIN'T ALL
IN THE FRONTRUNNER

13:56.168 --> 13:57.670
YOURSELF THERE, GIRL,

13:57.753 --> 14:00.756
- SWEETHEART, I'VE BEEN ON TOP
OF MY GAME THIS ENTIRE TIME.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.091
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.259
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
THE EASIEST PERSON

14:03.342 --> 14:06.804
TO PICK OFF
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

14:06.887 --> 14:08.764
YOU'RE GOING HOME
WITH THIS TATTOO.

14:08.847 --> 14:08.889
I PROMISE.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.782
- WELCOME TO
THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

14:26.865 --> 14:30.578
ON THE LINE, $100,000,
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

14:30.661 --> 14:31.829
AND THE TITLE OF INKMASTER.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.539
YOU'LL BE JUDGED
BY OLIVER PECK.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.292
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.837
THIS WEEK, WE
HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE,

14:39.920 --> 14:41.964
THE OWNER OF TRADEMARK TATTOO
IN DELAWARE

14:42.047 --> 14:44.133
AND STATE STREET TATTOO
IN PENNSYLVANIA.

14:44.216 --> 14:48.762
HE'S KNOWN FOR HIS IMPECCABLE
LINE WORK, BJ BETTS.

14:48.846 --> 14:54.476
[applause]
- NO [bleep].

14:54.560 --> 14:56.145
{\an8}- I'VE BEEN
TATTOOING FOR 20 YEARS.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.772
I SPECIALIZE IN LETTERING,
FLOURISHING,

14:58.856 --> 15:01.150
AND ORNAMENTAL, CLEAN TATTOOING.
- HEY, BJ.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.693
- HEY, DAVE. HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

15:02.776 --> 15:03.527
{\an8}- THIS DUDE IS A LEGEND.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.030
HE DOES GREAT LINES,

15:06.113 --> 15:08.991
AND DEFINITELY HE IS GOING TO BE
ON HIS GAME POINTING OUT FLAWS.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.909
- THANKS FOR JOINING US.
- ABSOLUTELY.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.286
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.079
- AS YOU KNOW,
WE'RE NOT YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.291
EACH WEEK, YOU'LL ALSO
BE JUDGED BY AMERICA.

15:17.374 --> 15:21.420
VIEWERS AT HOME WILL SCOUR
EVERY DETAIL OF YOUR ELIMINATION

15:21.503 --> 15:24.673
TATTOO AT
INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

15:24.757 --> 15:26.091
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.510
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

15:28.594 --> 15:29.845
AT THE LIVE FINALE.

15:29.928 --> 15:34.350
THIS WEEK,
WE'RE TESTING LINES.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.101
{\an8}- LINES ARE THE BACKBONE
OF EVERY TATTOO.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.270
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
THAT BONE STRUCTURE,

15:38.354 --> 15:40.856
YOU'RE IMAGE IS GONNA
BE TOTALLY SCREWED UP.

15:40.939 --> 15:45.611
- ONE OF THE MOST RIGOROUS TESTS
OF LINES IS ORNAMENTAL TATTOOS.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.530
- [bleep].

15:48.614 --> 15:50.949
- ORNAMENTAL TATTOOS
ARE INTRICATE PATTERNS

15:51.033 --> 15:54.536
OF LINES REPEATED
TO CREATE A COMPLEX DESIGN.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.996
{\an8}- I AM [bleep] STOKED.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.373
{\an8}THIS IS RIGHT UP
MY ALLEY.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.374
THIS IS WHAT I DO
AT HOME.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.709
I'M READY TO GO.
LET'S DO THIS.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.587
- AND REMEMBER,
IN EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,

16:03.671 --> 16:06.215
YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE TATTOOING HEAD-TO-HEAD

16:06.298 --> 16:08.342
WITH AT LEAST ONE
OTHER ARTIST,

16:08.425 --> 16:10.969
GIVING AN APPLES
TO APPLES COMPARISON.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.389
TODAY, THE CANVASES
ARE IN PAIRS.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.724
EVERY CANVAS

16:15.808 --> 16:19.603
WANTS THE SAME SUBJECT MATTER
AS ONE OTHER CANVAS.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.647
THAT MEANS YOU WILL ALL
BE GOING

16:21.730 --> 16:25.526
HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH ONE OTHER ARTIST.

16:25.609 --> 16:30.239
AND THE JUDGES WILL DIRECTLY
COMPARE YOUR WORK IN CRITIQUE.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.573
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,

16:31.657 --> 16:34.201
AND ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.869
- THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.579
IF WE'RE GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD,
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.540
{\an8}THERE'S GONNA BE ONE WINNER,
ONE LOSER.

16:39.623 --> 16:40.708
THERE'S NO SAFE ZONE.

16:40.791 --> 16:41.792
THERE'S NO RIDING
IN THE MIDDLE.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.085
ONE PERSON'S
GONNA BE THE WORST.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.878
ONE PERSON'S
GONNA BE THE BEST.

16:44.962 --> 16:45.212
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.679
AARON AND EMILY,
YOU WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

16:53.762 --> 16:58.308
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL HUMAN CANVASES TOGETHER.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.727
BY ASSIGNING THE SKULLS,

16:59.810 --> 17:02.271
YOU'RE ALSO DETERMINING
WHO TATTOOS HEAD-TO-HEAD.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.857
YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE NO ONE
IN THIS COMPETITION

17:04.940 --> 17:09.737
HAS EVER HAD,
SO USE IT WISELY.

17:09.819 --> 17:14.031
{\an8}- HAVING CONTROL OF THE FIRST
SKULL PICK IS TRULY GOD-LIKE.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.909
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO?

17:15.992 --> 17:18.119
- I WANT TO GET A BLACK
AND GRAY REVOLVER ON MY THIGH.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.415
- I'M ALSO GETTING A BLACK
AND GRAY REVOLVER ON MY FOREARM.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.791
- I'M LOOKING
FOR THE WORST CANVAS

17:23.876 --> 17:26.170
POSSIBLE TO GIVE TIM.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.048
HE'S A SORRY EXCUSE
FOR A TATTOO ARTIST.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.800
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE GOES HOME.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.137
- I WANT A BLACK
AND GRAY MANDALA ON MY RIBS.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.139
- I WOULD LIKE A BLACK
AND GRAY MANDALA IN MY ARMPIT.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.809
- IN YOUR ARMPIT,
GOOD TO KNOW.

17:40.893 --> 17:44.438
{\an8}- A TRUE ORNAMENTAL TATTOO
IS 90% LINE WORK.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.814
TO HAVE
A CLEAN PRESENTATION

17:45.898 --> 17:47.149
OF A MANDALA
ON AN ARMPIT IS IMPOSSIBLE.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.234
THERE'S GONNA BE PARTS
THAT LOOK WRONG

17:49.318 --> 17:50.444
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET IT
ON A FLAT PLANE.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.448
- COLORFUL PAISLEY PATTERN
UNDER MY BREASTS.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.950
- BLACK AND GRAY PAISLEY PATTERN
UNDER MY BREASTS.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.035
- I'M LIKE ANY OTHER MAN.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.203
I LOVE LOOKING AT BOOBIES.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.162
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.663
{\an8}I DON'T WANT
TO TATTOO THERE.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.000
THAT AREA IS SO SENSITIVE.

18:05.083 --> 18:08.504
- YEAH, I WANT THIS ONE
TO GO WITH THIS ONE.

18:08.587 --> 18:11.089
- I LOVE WINNING A SKULL PICK,
ESPECIALLY WITH EMILY,

18:11.173 --> 18:12.800
{\an8}BECAUSE SHE'S A BITCH.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.176
SO NO MATTER
WHAT WE DECIDE ON,

18:14.259 --> 18:15.844
SHE'S GONNA LOOK
LIKE THE BAD GUY.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.305
- THANKS, EVERYBODY.
- THAT WENT BETTER THAN I

18:18.388 --> 18:18.972
THOUGHT.
- MM-HM.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.682
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:20.766 --> 18:23.352
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.604
- ANGEL.

18:25.687 --> 18:29.858
- TY'ESHA.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.401
- ERIK.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.990
- JASON.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.536
- WHAT?
- JOSH.

18:46.875 --> 18:52.256
- TIM.
- [bleep].

18:52.339 --> 18:54.258
- JOSH'S LINE WORK
IS DAMN NEAR IMMACULATE.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.678
IT'S A NO-BRAINER
TO PAIR UP TIM AND JOSH.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.221
{\an8}JOSH WILL TAKE HIM OUT.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.472
{\an8}- EMILY'S WORSE
THAN A BULLY.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.140
{\an8}SHE'S A STRAIGHT-UP BITCH
AND PROUD OF IT.

19:03.976 --> 19:04.268
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

19:06.603 --> 19:07.604
- DON.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.525
- AARON.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.570
- CRIS.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.864
- THIS IS WHAT I DO,
AND THIS ISN'T WHAT CRIS DOES.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.323
HE'S GOT SHAKY LINE WORK.
HE'S GREEN AS [bleep].

19:18.407 --> 19:22.035
{\an8}SO HE IS AN EASY TARGET,
AND I'M GONNA TAKE HIM DOWN.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.495
{\an8}- EMILY.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.205
{\an8}- JULIA.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.291
{\an8}- I'M ABSOLUTELY THE STRONGEST
GIRL IN THIS COMPETITION.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.878
I'M DEFINITELY
GOING TO PROVE IT.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.379
- MARK.
- RIGHT HERE.

19:32.462 --> 19:33.589
- JAYVO.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.092
- RYAN.

19:37.175 --> 19:38.051
- ROBBIE.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.386
- THAT'S ME, BRO.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.472
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,

19:42.556 --> 19:44.391
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:44.474 --> 19:47.436
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE ONE TATTOO

19:47.519 --> 19:50.314
THAT THEY THINK IS THE WORST
AND PUT THAT ARTIST

19:50.397 --> 19:51.481
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.692
TOMORROW,
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS

19:53.775 --> 19:56.069
TO COMPLETE
YOUR ORNAMENTAL TATTOO.

19:56.153 --> 20:00.073
AND BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.325
GOOD LUCK.

20:03.410 --> 20:05.746
- THE WORD ORNAMENT
IS TO DECORATE WITH BEAUTY.

20:05.829 --> 20:07.331
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR,

20:07.414 --> 20:09.082
{\an8}A WAY THAT THESE ARTISTS CAN
SHOW US BEAUTIFUL DECORATIONS

20:09.166 --> 20:11.710
{\an8}ON WHATEVER
THEIR SUBJECT MATTER IS--

20:11.793 --> 20:13.629
ANYTHING THAT'S
PRECISE AND PERFECT.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.130
- HOW INTRICATE
DO YOU WANT IT?

20:15.213 --> 20:16.924
- SEE, I WOULD WANT
IT PRETTY INTRICATE.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.258
- YOU DOING RIGHT OR LEFT?
- I WAS GONNA DO LEFT.

20:18.342 --> 20:21.511
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTS A MANDALA
ON HER ARMPIT.

20:21.595 --> 20:22.846
NOW I'VE GOT
TO TRY AND CHANGE THE PLACEMENT

20:22.930 --> 20:24.973
SO IT CAN FIT RIGHT.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.516
- YOU COULD DO
IT SOMEWHERE ELSE, LIKE,

20:26.600 --> 20:28.101
IF YOU'RE FLEXIBLE WITH THAT.

20:28.185 --> 20:29.645
IF YOU WOULD PREFER THAT,

20:29.728 --> 20:32.314
I WAS THINKING OF THE SHOULDER
CAP OF EITHER--EITHER SIDE.

20:32.397 --> 20:33.607
- EVERYBODY'S CRAZY REACTION

20:33.690 --> 20:36.318
TO THE ARMPIT ACTUALLY ENDED UP
HELPING ME OUT.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.196
- all: OH!
- [bleep]

20:39.279 --> 20:40.405
SHE WANTED TO CHANGE IT

20:40.489 --> 20:42.616
BEFORE I EVEN GOT
TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.284
YOU LOOKING TO DO COLOR
OR BLACK AND GRAY.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.786
- BLACK AND GRAY.
- OKAY.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.871
THANKS FOR GIVING ME ONE OF
THE HARDEST SKULLS IN THE ROOM.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.373
TOO BAD YOUR PLAN BACKFIRED,
EMILY.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.799
- YOU GOT THE SKULL PICK.
- YEP.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.759
- YOU ACTUALLY ARE CHOOSING
PEOPLE'S FATE.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.803
- YEP.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.096
- SO HOW DO YOU FEEL?
YOU LIKE IT?

21:04.179 --> 21:05.555
- A LITTLE GOD-LIKE, YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.057
SO I'M STILL
KIND OF CONFUSED.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.392
WHY DID YOU GIVE ME
THE RIVAL TATTOO WITH TIM?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.936
- BECAUSE I KNEW
YOU'D BE ABLE TO BEAT HIM.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.021
- OH.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.607
- HOLDING YOU TO IT.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.234
- YOU ARE KIND OF
A CRAZY BITCH.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.152
- I CAME PREPARED.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.612
THERE'S ALWAYS A PLAN.
- BE CAREFUL.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.782
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT
EVERYBODY'S TARGET ON YOUR BACK.

21:23.865 --> 21:25.617
- I CAN DEAL WITH TARGETS.
- ALL RIGHT.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.910
- I MOVE PRETTY QUICK.

21:28.578 --> 21:32.916
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE AN ORNAMENTAL TATTOO.

21:34.918 --> 21:38.547
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.673
- ALL RIGHT.

21:39.756 --> 21:40.882
- COME ON BACK.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.134
{\an8}- ORNAMENTAL TATTOOS

21:42.217 --> 21:46.138
{\an8}ARE INTRICATE DESIGNS
THAT RELY HEAVILY ON LINE WORK.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.681
WITHOUT STRONG LINE WORK,

21:47.764 --> 21:49.725
NO ARTIST IS GONNA LAST LONG
IN THIS COMPETITION.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.353
ONE LITTLE MISTAKE COULD JUST
DROP THEM TO THE BOTTOM.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.563
- PARTY TIME.
YOU READY?

21:54.646 --> 21:55.814
- LET'S GO.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.947
- I ALREADY BEAT MY RIVAL,

22:04.031 --> 22:06.575
SO I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.909
- GOOD FOR YOU, GIRL.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.412
{\an8}- TODAY, I'M GOING
HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAINST EMILY.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.915
AND I CANNOT WAIT
TO SHUT HER UP.

22:13.999 --> 22:17.002
THEY ALL MAKE FUN OF MY VOICE
AND CALL ME SQUEAKY,

22:17.085 --> 22:20.297
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE IN STORE FOR.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.590
EMILY IS A JOKE TO ME.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.258
SHE KNOWS HER ARTWORK
ISN'T GOOD,

22:23.341 --> 22:25.260
SO SHE HAS TO TALK [bleep].

22:25.343 --> 22:26.762
I GOT TO GET RID OF HER.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.430
{\an8}- JULIA HAS THESE BIG PLANS

22:28.513 --> 22:31.099
{\an8}OF KNOCKING ME
OUT OF THIS COMPETITION.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.100
CHILD, PLEASE.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.061
I SET YOU UP WITH ME
FOR A REASON.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.605
I'M NOT GOING HOME.
[both laughing]

22:36.688 --> 22:39.483
I'M DEFINITELY THE BEST FEMALE
ARTIST IN THIS COMPETITION.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.279
- HOW'S MY NEW RIVAL DOING?
- GOOD, MAN.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.614
{\an8}BEING PAIRED UP
AGAINST MARK

22:45.697 --> 22:47.407
{\an8}IS PRETTY FAIR
BECAUSE NEITHER OF US HAVE A LOT

22:47.491 --> 22:50.452
{\an8}OF EXPERIENCE
IN THE ORNAMENTAL TATTOOING.

22:50.535 --> 22:50.994
I'M GONNA FIGHT FOR THIS.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.746
I NEED TO WIN.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.625
- THAT DUDE
NEVER SHUTS THE [bleep] UP.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.210
HE MUST BE IN THE ZONE.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.336
- LINE WORK CHALLENGE, YOU GOT
TO BE ON YOUR GAME, RIGHT?

22:59.419 --> 23:02.130
- I'M GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH ROBBIE.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.341
I'M NOT COMPLETELY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.218
I WAS IN A HORRIBLE CAR
ACCIDENT.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.594
{\an8}NOW I HAVE A TREMOR
IN MY WRIST,

23:07.677 --> 23:10.680
{\an8}AND IT TAKES ME TWICE THE EFFORT
TO DO LINE WORK.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.475
THIS CHALLENGE,
IT COULD SEND ME HOME.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.310
- THREE MORE HOURS.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.028
{\an8}- EMILY THINKS I HAVE NO CHANCE
GOING UP AGAINST JOSH TODAY,

23:25.112 --> 23:26.530
{\an8}BUT SHE'S WRONG.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.156
YOU DON'T STAY STILL
VERY WELL AT ALL.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.617
AND I WANT YOU TO KEEP STRAIGHT.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.494
I'M A LITTLE FRUSTRATED
WITH MY CANVAS BECAUSE

23:32.577 --> 23:33.995
SHE'S BEING CONSTANTLY FIDGETY.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.163
- REALLY NOT NOTICEABLE.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.250
- YES, IT IS.
SIT BACK, RELAX, HOLD STILL.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.585
STOP MOVING WHILE I'M TRYING
TO RUN A LINE.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.088
- TIM LEES LOOKS
LIKE HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME

23:43.171 --> 23:45.549
WITH HIS CANVAS,
WHICH DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

23:45.632 --> 23:46.842
{\an8}THE GUY'S PERSONALITY SUCKS,

23:46.925 --> 23:48.093
{\an8}AND HE ALWAYS ARGUES
WITH HIS CANVASES.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.679
- YOU GOT TO STOP BEING SO ANTSY
AND MOVING AROUND.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.181
YOU REALLY DO.
- THE GUY'S JUST A JOKE.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.518
- I'M GONNA SEND AARON HOME.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.771
{\an8}- I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURE
ABOUT THAT.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.191
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW.
AARON, IS YOURS GOOD?

24:03.275 --> 24:04.943
{\an8}- ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE
THINK THAT THEY CAN DO

24:05.026 --> 24:06.194
{\an8}ORNAMENTAL-STYLE TATTOOS,

24:06.278 --> 24:07.696
{\an8}AND THEY CAN'T EVEN
RUN STRAIGHT LINES.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.198
I THINK IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.
ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHALLENGES,

24:10.282 --> 24:12.117
ONE OF THE ONES EVERYONE ELSE
IS SWEATING OVER.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.286
I DO THIS.
THIS IS WHAT I DO AT HOME.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.579
CRIS AND THE REST
OF THE ARTISTS HERE

24:15.662 --> 24:16.872
SHOULD BE WORRIED TODAY.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.000
- TWO MORE HOURS TO GO,
EVERYBODY.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.334
TWO MORE HOURS.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.967
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.302
- I AM RELIEVED.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.970
- IT'S WAY BETTER
THAN PIN-UP DAY.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.723
{\an8}- LAST WEEK'S PIN-UP CHALLENGE
WAS A DISASTER.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.352
THIS WEEK, WE'RE ACTUALLY
SEEING SOME QUALITY WORK.

24:39.436 --> 24:40.729
- JOSH'S IS REAL NICE, MAN.
- YEAH.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.231
- WHAT ABOUT TIM'S?
ON TOP OF HER SHOULDER THERE?

24:43.315 --> 24:44.858
- IT'S A LITTLE BEAT.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.569
I'D DEFINITELY HATE TO BE
DOING THAT ONE AGAINST JOSH'S.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.988
THAT'S FOR SURE.
- YEAH.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.661
- SON OF A MOTHER.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.871
- THAT WOKE YOU UP, HUH?

24:57.954 --> 25:01.208
{\an8}- GOING UP AGAINST JASON
IS NOT AFFECTING ME AT ALL.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.752
{\an8}BUT MY CANVAS
IS DEFINITELY IN A LOT OF PAIN.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.170
{\an8}MAKES YOU FEEL ALIVE,
DOESN'T IT?

25:06.463 --> 25:08.465
WELL, YOU GOT
TO EARN IT.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.425
THERE'S $100,000
ON THE LINE,

25:10.508 --> 25:12.427
AND I HOPE THAT MY CANVAS
DOESN'T TAP OUT.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.179
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY ELSE.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.976
- FIVE, FOUR,

25:20.060 --> 25:23.188
THREE, TWO, ONE.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.106
THAT'S IT, MACHINES DOWN.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.234
NO MORE TATTOOING.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.653
- YOU ARE DONE.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.779
- WOW, MAN.
THAT IS AWESOME.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.531
THAT'S THE BEST TATTOO
I EVER GOT.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.532
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

25:34.616 --> 25:35.784
- CHECK IT OUT, MAN.

25:35.867 --> 25:37.577
- THAT'S COOL, MAN.
THAT'S HOT.

25:37.661 --> 25:40.080
{\an8}- AARON CALLED ME OUT
BY CHALLENGING ME HEAD-TO-HEAD.

25:40.163 --> 25:42.499
MY LINES ON THIS TATTOO
ARE PERFECT AND PRECISE.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.626
I KNOW I'M A BETTER ARTIST
THAN HE'LL EVER BE.

25:44.709 --> 25:45.877
- CRIS'S TATTOO IS FLAT.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.380
IT'S SUPER-BUSY.
THERE'S NO CONTRAST.

25:48.463 --> 25:50.590
I'M GOING TO KICK
CRIS'S LITTLE SHORT, BOW-TIED,

25:50.674 --> 25:51.883
SUSPENDER-WEARING ASS.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.428
{\an8}- YOU ARE THE BIGGEST PIECE

25:55.512 --> 25:57.305
{\an8}OF [bleep]
I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.140
- JOSH'S IS MUCH CLEANER.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.934
- I WOULD DISAGREE
WITH THAT ALL THE WAY.

26:01.017 --> 26:01.601
- YOU'RE NOT ONE
OF THE JUDGES.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.654
- CAN I JUST POINT
SOMETHING OUT

26:12.737 --> 26:14.614
THAT I THINK
IS REALLY ENTERTAINING?

26:14.698 --> 26:17.951
I THINK AARON AND CRIS
DID VERY NICE SKULLS,

26:18.034 --> 26:20.912
BUT DID YOU HAPPEN TO NOTICE
ANY LIKENESSES BETWEEN THEM?

26:20.996 --> 26:23.206
THEY BOTH HAD EARS.
[all laughing]

26:23.290 --> 26:25.458
{\an8}- YEAH, DUDE.
YOURS, THE WAY YOU SHADED IT,

26:25.542 --> 26:28.211
{\an8}IT TOTALLY LOOKED LIKE A [bleep]
EAR, LIKE SIDEWAYS.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.337
{\an8}- BACKWARDS EAR.
- SKULL WITH AN EAR?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.339
{\an8}- YEAH, DUDE.
STRAIGHT UP LIKE AN EAR.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.674
- YOU KNOW YOU MESSED UP.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.467
- THAT'S A PART
OF THE [bleep] SKULL.

26:34.551 --> 26:35.135
- YOU DREW IT WRONG
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU DON'T

26:35.218 --> 26:37.554
KNOW HOW TO DRAW.

26:37.637 --> 26:38.972
- CRIS IS ABSOLUTELY
DELUSIONAL.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.807
MY SKULL KICKS THE [bleep] OUT
OF CRIS'S SKULL.

26:40.890 --> 26:43.893
THIS IS YOU KNOWING
YOU [bleep] LOST THIS.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.186
- YEAH.
BULL[bleep].

26:45.270 --> 26:46.604
- HOW IS THAT BULL[bleep]?

26:46.688 --> 26:47.897
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A PIECE
OF [bleep], THAT'S WHY,

26:47.981 --> 26:49.274
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY,

26:49.357 --> 26:50.525
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST STOP TALKING.

26:50.608 --> 26:52.861
- I CAN SCOTCH TAPE
A [bleep] EAR TO THE TATTOO

26:52.944 --> 26:55.155
AND HAVE THAT JUDGED WITH IT
AND STILL [bleep] WIN.

26:55.238 --> 26:56.698
- YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST STOP TALKING.

26:56.781 --> 26:57.949
- [bleep] YOU, MOTHER[bleep].
- YOU [bleep]!

26:58.033 --> 27:00.201
COME HERE, COME ON!
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.745
- DO IT AGAIN!
COME ON, DO IT AGAIN!

27:01.828 --> 27:03.038
- CALM DOWN.
- HEY, YOU WANT TO GO HOME?

27:03.121 --> 27:05.874
[all yelling]

27:05.957 --> 27:06.708
- CALM DOWN.
- RELAX.

27:10.253 --> 27:13.256
- CRIS, THE WORST PART IS
YOU'RE GONNA GET BEAT BY A SKULL

27:13.340 --> 27:14.341
WITH AN EAR.
- OH!

27:14.424 --> 27:16.301
- [bleep] YOU.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.068
- TODAY, YOU HAD TO USE
INTRICATE PATTERNS OF LINE WORK

27:33.151 --> 27:35.070
TO CREATE ORNAMENTAL TATTOOS.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.906
EACH OF YOU TATTOOED HEAD-TO-
HEAD WITH ANOTHER ARTIST,

27:37.989 --> 27:40.075
AND WE WILL DIRECTLY
COMPARE YOUR WORK.

27:40.158 --> 27:40.825
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,

27:40.909 --> 27:43.953
AND ONE OF YOU WILL LOSE.

27:44.037 --> 27:45.622
- I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM

27:45.705 --> 27:46.956
DID MUCH BETTER TATTOOS
THIS WEEK.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.710
SO I AM HAPPY FOR THE FACT
THAT EVERYBODY STEPPED UP.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.840
- CRIS, LET'S START WITH YOU.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.342
YOU WERE UP AGAINST AARON,

27:57.425 --> 27:59.677
AND AARON WAS PART OF A TEAM
THAT HANDED OUT THE SKULLS.

27:59.761 --> 28:03.264
SO HE GAVE YOU THIS CHALLENGE
AGAINST HIM.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.641
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT?

28:04.724 --> 28:06.726
- I DIDN'T REALLY LET IT
AFFECT ME TOO MUCH.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.269
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT
IN MY PIECE.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.105
- I LIKE THE LITTLE BIT
OF AREAS OF SOFTNESS

28:10.188 --> 28:12.357
THAT YOU HAVE, LIKE THE ONE
LITTLE PIECE OF FILLER

28:12.440 --> 28:13.608
THAT'S KIND OF OFF,
OUT OF FOCUS.

28:13.691 --> 28:17.779
OVERALL, YOU DO HAVE
SOME NICE LINE WORK IN HERE.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.697
- AARON.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.117
- THE BAD PART OF THE SKULL
LOOKS A LITTLE EAR-ISH,

28:22.200 --> 28:23.535
BUT I THINK THE LINES
ARE AMAZINGLY CLEAN.

28:23.618 --> 28:26.955
I LIKE THE USE OF THE RED
UP AGAINST THAT LIGHTER GRAY.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.164
IT'S A GREAT TATTOO, MAN.

28:28.248 --> 28:29.833
- THANK YOU.

28:29.916 --> 28:32.127
- IT'S TIME TO POLL
THE JUDGES IN TERMS

28:32.210 --> 28:34.671
OF THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPETITION
BETWEEN AARON AND CRIS.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.340
- THESE TWO TATTOOS
ARE BOTH VERY CLEAN,

28:37.424 --> 28:38.716
BUT THE LINES THAT AARON

28:38.800 --> 28:40.718
PUT IN THERE EDGE HIM OVER
THE TOP A LITTLE BIT FOR ME.

28:40.802 --> 28:41.970
- I'LL HAVE
TO SAY AARON AS WELL.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.304
- I'M GONNA GO WITH AARON
AS WELL.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.639
CRIS?
- AARON.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.724
- THE WINNER OF THE HEAD-TO-HEAD
COMPETITION IS AARON.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.729
- TY'ESHA,
YOU WENT UP AGAINST ANGEL.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.774
- WELL,
THIS IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.151
I LIKE THE TATTOO,

28:56.234 --> 28:59.112
BUT THE ACTUAL LINE
THAT IS THE TOP OF THE BARREL,

28:59.195 --> 29:00.405
IT'S NOT VERY STRAIGHT.

29:00.488 --> 29:00.947
TO WIN THE WHOLE THING,
GOTTA BE DEAD ON.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.035
- ANGEL.
- THERE'S A LOT

29:06.119 --> 29:07.745
OF INCONSISTENCIES
IN YOUR LINE WORK.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.289
THERE'S A LOT OF LINES
THAT OVERCROSS,

29:09.372 --> 29:13.001
AND THERE'S SOME LINES
THAT JUST DON'T LOOK FINISHED.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.502
- TIME TO POLL THE JUDGES
AND SEE WHO WON BETWEEN

29:14.586 --> 29:16.838
TY'ESHA AND ANGEL.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.174
- I REALLY FEEL
LIKE I SAW MORE IMPROVEMENT

29:19.257 --> 29:19.924
OUT OF TY'ESHA'S TATTOO.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.551
TY'ESHA FOR THE WIN.

29:21.634 --> 29:23.595
- TY'ESHA.
- TY'ESHA.

29:23.678 --> 29:26.931
- TY'ESHA, CONGRATULATIONS.
CLEEN.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.766
YOU WERE HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH DON.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.518
AND THE FACT
THAT YOU MADE IT A DARK,

29:30.602 --> 29:32.520
GRAPHIC IMAGE WAS A VERY,
VERY SMART MOVE.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.730
- THE BLACK IS SOLID.

29:33.813 --> 29:37.233
THE SHADE FROM BLACK
TO LIGHT IS SMOOTH.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.694
GOOD, CLEAN,
PROFESSIONAL TATTOO RIGHT HERE.

29:39.777 --> 29:41.029
- DON.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.198
- THE THING THAT BOTHERS ME
THE MOST ABOUT THIS,

29:43.281 --> 29:45.033
IN THE CENTER PART,
WHERE THOSE DOTS ARE,

29:45.116 --> 29:47.494
THE TWO LINES COMING OFF
THOSE ARE PRETTY SHAKY.

29:47.577 --> 29:47.869
IT JUST LOOKS INCONSISTENT.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.706
- NOW IT'S TIME
TO POLL THE JUDGES

29:51.789 --> 29:53.082
BETWEEN CLEEN AND DON.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.251
- I GOT TO GO WITH CLEEN.
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO

29:55.335 --> 29:56.586
WITH CLEEN ON THIS ONE, TOO.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.922
- OVERALL, CRAFTSMANSHIP,
TECHNICIAN, CLEEN.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.673
- AND I'M GONNA
GO WITH CLEEN, TOO.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.050
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.177
- THANK YOU.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.387
- EMILY.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.139
YOU HANDED OUT THE SKULLS
WITH AARON.

30:08.223 --> 30:12.727
WHY DID YOU GIVE JULIA THE SKULL
TO FACE OFF AGAINST YOU?

30:12.810 --> 30:15.396
- THERE WAS ONLY A FEW THAT
WERE INTENTIONALLY HANDED OUT.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.065
- WHO WERE THOSE FEW?
- TIM AND JOSH'S

30:17.148 --> 30:18.775
BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT JOSH WOULD SCHOOL TIM,

30:18.858 --> 30:20.652
AND I WANT TIM GONE.
- WHY IS THAT?

30:20.735 --> 30:22.237
- HE'S A POOR EXCUSE
FOR A SCRATCHER.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.279
I'D NEVER REFER TO HIM
AS A TATTOO ARTIST.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.698
- DAMN!
- WOW.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.658
- WOW!

30:26.741 --> 30:28.576
[whistles]
OKAY.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.912
OLIVER, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE HUMPS THAT EMILY TURNED IN.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.163
- IT LOOKS LIKE A WEIRD OVEN
MITT TO ME.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.957
YOU HAVE THE PATTERN
THAT GOES DOWN THE CENTER.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.793
THAT'S THE INTRICATE PART
OF THE DETAIL,

30:36.876 --> 30:39.087
AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR LINE WORK
SUFFERS THE MOST.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.713
THERE WAS JUST A LOT
OF POOR LINES IN IT.

30:44.342 --> 30:45.260
- JULIA.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.928
{\an8}- LOOKING
AT THE OVERALL LINE WORK,

30:47.011 --> 30:49.264
{\an8}YOU HAVE A LOT
OF NICE MOMENTS IN HERE.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.182
{\an8}BUT IF YOU LOOK
ABOVE YOUR BOLD LINE

30:51.266 --> 30:52.559
{\an8}THAT GOES THROUGH
THE CENTER,

30:52.642 --> 30:54.269
{\an8}THE SHADING
JUST LOOKS ROUGH AND QUICK.

30:54.352 --> 30:55.436
- I TOOK MY TIME
ON THAT WHOLE THING.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.479
THAT OUTLINE ALONE--

30:56.563 --> 30:57.564
- WELL, DOES IT
LOOK EVEN THROUGHOUT?

30:57.647 --> 30:58.940
- YEAH,
I THINK IT DOES.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.108
- IF YOU DON'T SEE
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,

31:00.191 --> 31:03.111
HOW ARE YOU GONNA KNOW
TO NOT DO IT AGAIN?

31:03.194 --> 31:08.116
- LET'S POLL THE JUDGES.
HEAD-TO-HEAD, EMILY AND JULIA.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.576
- I LIKE EMILY'S
A LITTLE BETTER.

31:09.659 --> 31:10.827
- I'M GONNA GO WITH JULIA.
- LOOKING AT LINE WORK,

31:10.910 --> 31:12.954
I WOULD HAVE
TO SAY JULIA.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.123
- PART OF MY GUT
JUST GOES ON WHICH TATTOO

31:15.206 --> 31:17.125
IS AESTHETICALLY
MORE PLEASING.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.459
GOING WITH JULIA.

31:18.543 --> 31:21.296
- THE WINNER OF THE HEAD-TO-HEAD
COMPETITION IS JULIA.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.383
ERIK, YOU WENT HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH JASON.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.635
- THIS CENTER, MAN,
MAKES ME HATE THIS TATTOO.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.886
LOOK AT THAT ONE LEAF.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.346
THE VEINS
IN THE LEAF JUST

31:30.430 --> 31:32.557
GO THE WRONG DIRECTION
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THEM.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.891
THAT'S WONKY AS HELL, MAN.

31:35.977 --> 31:36.978
- JASON.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.479
- AT FIRST GLANCE,
IT LOOKS GREAT.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.023
BUT WHEN YOU
GET UP ON IT,

31:40.106 --> 31:43.067
YOU SEE A LOT OF AREAS WHERE
YOUR THINNER LINE ON THE INSIDE

31:43.151 --> 31:45.236
AND YOUR BOLD LINE ON
THE OUTSIDE DON'T RUN PARALLEL.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.113
- YOU ALSO HAVE
QUITE A FEW HICCUPS.

31:47.196 --> 31:49.866
VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO A TATTOO
WITHOUT ANY LINE HICCUPS,

31:49.949 --> 31:51.826
BUT THAT'S WHAT
WE WANT TO SEE.

31:51.909 --> 31:53.786
- JASON CLAY DUNN
AGAINST ERIK.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.788
POLLING THE JUDGES HERE,
HEAD-TO-HEAD.

31:55.872 --> 31:56.831
- I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GO FOR JASON.

31:56.914 --> 31:57.749
- JASON.
- I'M GONNA GO WITH ERIK.

31:57.832 --> 31:58.875
- NOW WE HAVE
A SPLIT ROOM,

31:58.958 --> 32:01.127
'CAUSE I'M ERIK.
- AH, MAN.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.504
{\an8}- IF YOU JUST LOOK AT LINE WORK,
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.757
{\an8}- BUT THEY BOTH HAVE
INCONSISTENCIES IN THEIR LINES.

32:05.840 --> 32:06.924
{\an8}THEY BOTH HAVE NON-SYMMETRICAL
AREAS.

32:07.008 --> 32:09.135
{\an8}- I WOULD DISAGREE
WITH THAT ALL THE WAY.

32:09.218 --> 32:12.138
I CAN WALK UP THERE AND POINT IT
ALL OUT TO YOU GUYS.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.640
- YOU'RE NOT ONE
OF THE JUDGES HERE.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.016
- I KNOW, BUT I'M FIGHTING
FOR MY LIFE, DAVE, SO...

32:15.099 --> 32:17.977
- ON ERIK'S TATTOO,
THE LINE WORK IS MUCH CLEANER.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.520
IT'S JUST UNFINISHED.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.648
- LET'S TAKE A FINAL POLL
HERE FOR FINAL ANSWER.

32:21.731 --> 32:23.983
- STICKING WITH JASON.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.360
- I'M GONNA GO WITH ERIK.
- I'M ERIK.

32:25.443 --> 32:27.862
WITH ONE MORE PASS, THAT TATTOO
CAN BE MADE TO LOOK NICE.

32:27.945 --> 32:30.239
- I AGREE.
I WAS ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT,

32:30.323 --> 32:31.783
BUT I'LL HAVE
TO GO WITH ERIK.

32:31.866 --> 32:33.076
- ALL RIGHT, SO THE WINNER

32:33.159 --> 32:34.827
OF THE HEAD-TO-HEAD CHALLENGE
HERE IS ERIK.

32:34.911 --> 32:35.370
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.456
- THANK YOU.

32:38.539 --> 32:41.250
- JOSH, YOU WENT UP
AGAINST TIM.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.710
- THIS IS A NICE TATTOO.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.962
THE CONTRAST ON THE BLACK
COMPARED TO THE GRAY IS PERFECT.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.673
THE OUTLINE LOOKS
LIKE IT WAS DONE WITH A LASER.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.007
IT'S LASER-SHARP, MAN.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.635
- TIM.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.053
- I LIKE THE GRAPHIC SIDE
OF IT.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.722
BUT I SEE TONS
AND TONS OF IRREGULARITIES.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.015
AND THE IDEA
FOR THIS IS LINE WORK.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.601
- MOST OF MY LINES
ARE A CLEAN PASS,

32:58.685 --> 33:00.561
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON A CANVAS,
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT CASE.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.523
- YOUR LINE WORK IS THE BONES
TO THE REST OF THE BODY.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.150
IF THERE'S NOT GOOD BONES,
YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD BODY.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.444
- THIS IS OUR ONE CLEAR

33:08.528 --> 33:09.821
RUNAWAY WINNER FOR THE DAY, MAN.
JOSH NAILED IT.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.572
- THE BEST ONE FROM TODAY,

33:11.656 --> 33:13.074
IN MY OPINION.
- JOSH.

33:13.157 --> 33:15.702
- JOSH HAS WON THE HEAD-TO-HEAD
WITH TIM.

33:15.785 --> 33:16.994
CONGRATULATIONS, JOSH.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.415
- JAYVO,

33:20.498 --> 33:21.499
YOU WENT UP AGAINST MARK.

33:21.582 --> 33:23.418
- THE LINES
ARE A LITTLE INCONSISTENT.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.586
TO THE RIGHT, ON THAT LEAF
COMING UNDER THE EYE,

33:25.670 --> 33:27.380
YOU'VE GOT THREE OR FOUR LINES
ON THAT SIDE.

33:27.463 --> 33:28.965
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE,
THEY'RE NOT THERE.

33:29.048 --> 33:30.550
- IF YOU CAN'T PULL
THE DETAILS OFF THAT SMALL,

33:30.633 --> 33:32.969
DON'T DO THEM.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.679
- MARK.

33:34.762 --> 33:35.847
- IT'S A NICE, BRIGHT TATTOO,

33:35.930 --> 33:36.973
BUT THOSE LITTLE WHITE LINES
IN THE FLOWER

33:37.056 --> 33:39.767
AND UNDERNEATH THE EYE,
THAT'S A LINE,

33:39.851 --> 33:40.852
AND IT'S A PRETTY BAD ONE.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.103
IF THAT WAS A BLACK LINE,

33:42.186 --> 33:43.604
YOU WOULDN'T WANT
TO DO IT LIKE THAT.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.148
- I JUST NEED TO STEP UP
MY GAME.

33:45.231 --> 33:47.567
- TATTOOING LIKE THIS IS NOT
GONNA WIN THIS COMPETITION.

33:47.650 --> 33:49.068
{\an8}I'M SURPRISED
AT HOW CLOSE IT IS,

33:49.152 --> 33:52.822
{\an8}BUT BASED ON ALL THE MISTAKES
THAT WE SEE IN JAYVO'S TATTOO,

33:52.905 --> 33:54.323
{\an8}I'M GONNA GO WITH MARK.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.742
- I'M GONNA GO WITH MARK.
- I'M GOING WITH MARK.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.453
- THAT MEANS THE WINNER OF THIS
HEAD-TO-HEAD CHALLENGE IS MARK.

33:58.536 --> 33:59.579
NICE JOB, BUDDY.

33:59.662 --> 34:02.290
- THANK YOU GUYS.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.084
- ROBBIE, YOU WENT UP
AGAINST RYAN.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.711
- OVERALL,
I LIKE THIS DESIGN.

34:06.794 --> 34:09.255
AS FAR AS THE LINE WORK GOES,
YOU GOT A NICE, SCULPTED LINE

34:09.338 --> 34:10.297
AROUND THE OUTSIDE
AND EVERYTHING.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.507
IT LOOKS REALLY CLEAN.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.800
I LIKE THIS TATTOO.

34:13.967 --> 34:15.219
- RYAN,

34:15.303 --> 34:16.471
HOW ARE YOU
WITH LINE WORK?

34:16.554 --> 34:18.431
- MY HAND WAS [bleep] UP
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

34:18.514 --> 34:19.849
- OH.

34:19.931 --> 34:21.100
- I HAVE NERVE DAMAGE.
IT GOES HALFWAY UP ARM.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.726
BUT I'M NOT GONNA USE
THAT AS A CRUTCH, DUDE.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.103
WE CAME HERE TO GET GAME ON.
LET'S GET [bleep] GAME ON.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.438
- YOU DO HAVE A FEW HICCUPS
ON THIS OUTLINE.

34:25.521 --> 34:28.900
YOU DO HAVE A COUPLE AREAS
WHERE YOU GET THAT WOBBLE.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.443
THIS IS
ABOUT CRAFTSMANSHIP,

34:30.525 --> 34:32.487
AND YOUR LINE WORK
IS YOUR CRAFTSMANSHIP.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.489
YOU'VE GOT TO
TIGHTEN UP, MAN.

34:35.572 --> 34:36.991
- ALL RIGHT,
POLLING THE JUDGES HERE

34:37.074 --> 34:38.659
BETWEEN ROBBIE AND RYAN.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.161
- I THINK ROBBIE'S OVERALL
FILLED UP THE SPACE NICE.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.621
IT WAS JUST
A BIG, SOLID TATTOO.

34:42.705 --> 34:43.664
- I'M GONNA GO
WITH ROBBIE.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.998
- ROBBIE.
- ROBBIE.

34:45.081 --> 34:49.170
- CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU WON THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.215
ARTISTS, THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW,

34:52.297 --> 34:56.177
AND THEIR VOTE WILL PUT
ONE ARTIST UP FOR ELIMINATION.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.470
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

34:57.553 --> 34:58.137
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

35:06.103 --> 35:07.063
- WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

35:07.146 --> 35:08.606
- WHAT'S UP,
DEVILISH BITCH?

35:08.689 --> 35:11.025
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?
- I'M AWESOME COMPARED TO YOU.

35:11.108 --> 35:12.693
- OH, TALK ALL THAT [bleep].

35:12.777 --> 35:14.028
YOU'RE GONNA PUT ME UP AGAINST
THE STRONGEST ONE IN THE HOUSE.

35:14.111 --> 35:15.780
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME KNOW
YOU'RE THREATENED BY ME.

35:15.863 --> 35:16.948
I APPRECIATE IT.
- I'M NOT THREATENED BY YOU.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.491
I JUST WANT YOU
OUT OF MY [bleep] HAIR.

35:18.574 --> 35:19.283
- YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE, 'CAUSE YOU
TALK ALL THAT [bleep].

35:19.367 --> 35:20.409
- YOU ARE THE BIGGEST PIECE

35:20.493 --> 35:22.453
OF [bleep]
I'VE EVER MET IN MY LIFE.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.163
- OBVIOUSLY I'M ONE
OF THE BIGGEST THREATS IN HERE

35:24.247 --> 35:25.540
'CAUSE I'M THE ONE
YOU'RE GIVING [bleep] TO.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.166
SHE AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE
IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.209
- PLEASE.
- YOU REALLY AIN'T.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.126
- DUDE, YOU'RE GOING HOME,

35:29.210 --> 35:31.128
AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU...

35:31.212 --> 35:32.755
- YOU KEEP TRYING.
- WALK OUT THE DOOR.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.132
- I JUST WANT A POLAROID OF
YOUR FACE WHEN IT DON'T HAPPEN.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.299
- [bleep] YOU, DUDE.

35:35.383 --> 35:36.175
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.226
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY

35:45.309 --> 35:47.854
WE'RE LOOKING AT ORNAMENTAL
TATTOOS, TESTING LINE.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.146
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE BOTTOM.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.107
I GOT TO SAY, I'M LOOKING
AT JAYVO WITH THAT OWL.

35:51.190 --> 35:52.567
- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS
FROM A DISTANCE,

35:52.650 --> 35:54.652
YOU CAN'T REALLY
PULL MUCH LINE WORK OUT.

35:54.735 --> 35:55.903
- THE SHADING
ON THAT DIAMOND

35:55.987 --> 35:56.863
LOOKS VERY SIMILAR
TO THE PATTERN.

35:56.946 --> 35:59.031
IT JUST GETS
COMPLETELY LOST.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.116
IT'S A MESS.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.951
- I GOT TO PUT RYAN
ON THE BOTTOM.

36:02.034 --> 36:04.620
THIS BIRD HEAD
IS JUST NOT GOOD.

36:04.704 --> 36:08.249
- THE COMPOSITION
OF THIS IS SO FAR OFF.

36:08.332 --> 36:09.584
- NEXT UP, WE HAD TIM.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.586
- THERE'S A LOT OF LINES
THAT AREN'T SYMMETRICAL.

36:11.669 --> 36:12.670
- ESPECIALLY IN
THOSE MIDDLE CIRCLES.

36:12.753 --> 36:13.754
IT'S KIND OF ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.173
- ABSOLUTELY.

36:16.257 --> 36:17.633
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IT'S A REALLY TIGHT RACE HERE.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.678
IT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING TO SEE
WHO THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

36:20.761 --> 36:21.512
VOTES INTO THE BOTTOM.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.222
{\an8}- YEAH.

36:23.306 --> 36:26.142
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO DETERMINE WHO
HAS THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.310
- THIS IS MY TATTOO.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.603
MY ARTIST WAS TIM.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.229
I LOVE IT.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.522
- THAT LOOKS JUVENILE.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.608
THE LINES ARE,
LIKE, CROOKED.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.276
- IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM EVEN.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.944
- THE PATTERN REALLY
ISN'T SYMMETRICAL

36:37.028 --> 36:38.112
ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.113
- I DON'T THINK
HE DESERVES TO BE IN THE BOTTOM.

36:39.196 --> 36:42.366
I THINK HE KNOWS
HIS [bleep].

36:42.450 --> 36:45.661
- THAT'S MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST WAS EMILY.

36:45.745 --> 36:48.456
- THE EYEBALL SEEMS LIKE IT
COULD HAVE BEEN ON ITS OWN.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.124
- IT LOOKS
LIKE A REALISTIC TATTOO AND THEN

36:50.207 --> 36:51.876
A CARTOON TATTOO AROUND IT.
- YEAH.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.669
- THE HAND ISN'T
VERY WELL DEFINED.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.505
YOU CAN'T SEE THE FINGERS ON IT.
- THAT'S A HAMSA.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.634
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ACTUAL HAND.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.136
- THAT'S MY TATTOO,
AND MY ARTIST IS ERIK.

37:02.219 --> 37:05.473
- ERIK'S WAS THE ONLY ONE
THAT DIDN'T FEEL COHESIVE.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.350
- THEY LOOK LIKE TWO
DIFFERENT TATTOOS.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.018
- WHAT'S KILLING ME
IS THE VEINS IN THE LEAVES.

37:09.101 --> 37:11.145
- OH, YEAH.
- THEY ALL GO,

37:11.228 --> 37:12.230
LIKE ONE DIRECTION.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.439
- I THINK IT'S SO MINOR.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.066
LIKE, YOU COULD
BARELY SEE THAT.

37:15.149 --> 37:16.025
- LOOKING AT IT THE WAY
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT,

37:16.108 --> 37:19.111
THERE'S A LOT OF FLAWS.

37:19.195 --> 37:20.988
- HAVE WE REACHED
A DECISION?

37:21.072 --> 37:23.616
all: YES.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.284
- SO STRESSFUL.

37:31.457 --> 37:32.750
- OH, MAN, HERE WE GO.

37:34.877 --> 37:38.297
- ALL RIGHT,
THE JUDGES WANT TO SEE...

37:38.381 --> 37:40.049
RYAN,

37:40.132 --> 37:40.841
JAYVO,

37:40.925 --> 37:43.469
AND ERIK.

37:43.552 --> 37:45.888
WE'LL SEE YOU AND YOUR RIVALS
DOWNSTAIRS.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.643
- I DIDN'T EXPECT
THAT AT ALL.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.853
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, BUD.
I GOT BIG-ASS SHOULDERS.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.231
LET'S [bleep] DO THIS.
I AIN'T SCARED OF [bleep].

37:55.314 --> 37:56.691
- GOOD LUCK, RYAN.
- GOOD LUCK, BRO.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.151
- GOOD LUCK.

38:06.826 --> 38:09.704
- TODAY, WE ASKED YOU TO SHOW
CLEAN, SOLID LINE WORK

38:09.787 --> 38:11.455
WITH ORNAMENTAL TATTOOS.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.290
ERIK, JAYVO,

38:13.374 --> 38:17.044
AND RYAN, ANY ONE OF YOU
COULD JUSTIFIABLY BE ELIMINATED.

38:18.796 --> 38:22.675
ERIK, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:22.758 --> 38:26.804
DETERMINED THAT YOU HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:26.887 --> 38:29.265
- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE LOTUS
FLOWER WASN'T UP TO PAR.

38:29.348 --> 38:30.516
AND WHAT PISSES ME OFF MORE

38:30.599 --> 38:32.309
IS THAT THAT'S THE STYLE
I TATTOO IN.

38:32.393 --> 38:34.395
THERE'S JAPANESE
AND ASIAN-INSPIRED WORK.

38:34.478 --> 38:36.731
BUT AS FAR AS THE LINES ARE
CONCERNED, THEY'RE PRETTY CLEAN.

38:36.814 --> 38:37.940
{\an8}- YOU SEE HOW CLOSE IT WAS

38:38.024 --> 38:39.233
{\an8}JUST BETWEEN THE TWO TATTOOS
IN THIS HEAD-TO-HEAD.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.485
{\an8}AND HONESTLY, MAN,
I'M NOT REALLY

38:41.569 --> 38:43.988
{\an8}THAT SURPRISED THAT THIS IS
WHAT THE HUMAN CANVASES PICKED.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.158
- RYAN.

38:47.241 --> 38:49.243
- I FEEL LIKE THERE WASN'T A LOT
OF LINE WORK TO JUDGE.

38:49.326 --> 38:50.870
AND THE LINE WORK
THAT WAS JUDGED

38:50.953 --> 38:52.204
GETS A LITTLE
BELOW THE MARK.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.372
- I [bleep] MADE THAT
WITH MY HEART, DUDE.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.832
I DREW EVERY INCH
OF THAT [bleep].

38:54.915 --> 38:56.625
- RYAN, IF YOU GO FURTHER
IN THIS COMPETITION,

38:56.709 --> 38:58.085
TAKE THESE CRITIQUES
AND HIT THESE CHALLENGES.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.254
HIT THEM ON THE HEAD, MAN.

39:00.838 --> 39:03.507
- JAYVO.

39:03.591 --> 39:06.052
- TODAY IS ONE OF THOSE DAYS
WHERE REAL TECHNICAL PRECISION

39:06.135 --> 39:07.511
COME INTO PLAY.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.222
LOOKING AT THIS TATTOO, THERE'S
JUST A LOT OF DISCREPANCIES.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.307
- I HAVE THE MOST HEART
OUT OF ANYBODY HERE.

39:11.390 --> 39:14.018
I'M WORKING HERE,
AND I'M PUSHING.

39:14.101 --> 39:15.436
I'VE SHOWN
THAT I'M A COMPETITOR,

39:15.519 --> 39:18.064
AND I'VE SHOWN THAT I HAVE
THE HEART AND THE [bleep] RIGHT

39:18.147 --> 39:19.732
TO DESERVE TO BE HERE.

39:19.815 --> 39:23.277
- I ALWAYS RESENTED HIM BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T HAVE THAT PASSION.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.487
AND I [bleep] SEE IT NOW.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.405
WE CAME HERE
ON A REAL BAD BEEF,

39:26.489 --> 39:28.365
AND WE'VE BEEN
REALLY SORTING

39:28.449 --> 39:29.658
[bleep] OUT BIG TIME.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.285
THIS GUY'S REALLY FIGHTING
TO BE HERE.

39:31.368 --> 39:33.079
- YOU GUYS WOULD BE
DOING A BIG DISSERVICE

39:33.162 --> 39:34.497
TO THIS COMPETITION
TO LET ME GO.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.957
- YOU PUT THE EFFORT IN,
BUT THE THING STILL REMAINS

39:37.041 --> 39:38.834
THAT THIS GOT YOU
DOWN HERE.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.463
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:48.928 --> 39:53.599
JAYVO, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INKMASTER.

39:53.682 --> 39:55.476
- YOU LOST A TATTOO CONTEST,

39:55.559 --> 39:57.728
BUT YOU JUST WON A BROTHER.
- GODDAMN RIGHT.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.522
- AMEN.

39:59.605 --> 40:02.942
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:03.025 --> 40:06.070
- LOVE YOU, BRO.
I LOVE YOU, BRO.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.364
- WIN THIS [bleep] FOR ME.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.410
THERE'S NO [bleep] WAY
THAT I SHOULD BE GOING HOME.

40:16.914 --> 40:17.790
[exhales deeply]]

40:17.873 --> 40:19.333
I DID WHAT I CAME
HERE TO DO.

40:19.416 --> 40:20.876
I EARNED
MY BROTHER'S RESPECT.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.378
I CAN ONLY MOVE FORWARD
FROM HERE.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.466
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INKMASTER...</i>

40:27.550 --> 40:29.677
- I'M GONNA FOCUS
ON ONE MOTHER[bleep]

40:29.760 --> 40:32.346
AND PICK HIM OFF
LIKE A [bleep] ZIT.

40:32.429 --> 40:35.349
- YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
BE A STUPID BITCH.

40:35.432 --> 40:37.685
- YOU'RE GOING HOME
WITH THIS TATTOO, I PROMISE.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.854
- EMILY'S GOING OUT OF HER WAY
TO WAKE THE BEAST

40:39.937 --> 40:41.313
THAT I'M TRYING TO CONTAIN.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.023
- HOLY COW, THIS THING
IS HAMMERED IN THERE AND ROUGH.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.068
- YOU SHOULD FEEL INCREDIBLY
LUCKY THAT THERE'S PEOPLE

40:46.152 --> 40:47.027
THAT ARE JUST
WORSE THAN YOU.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.863
- I GAVE UP
BEFORE I STARTED.

40:48.946 --> 40:49.989
- THIS IS SUICIDE.

40:50.072 --> 40:51.031
- THE [bleep] ARE YOU DOING?

40:51.115 --> 40:52.116
STOP BEING A PUSSY, MAN.

40:52.199 --> 40:54.577
IF YOU'RE MY COMPETITOR,
GIVE ME A FIGHT.
