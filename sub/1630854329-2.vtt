01:20.580 --> 01:21.790
Like in Florence?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.155
Damn, that's really good.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.422
I'm writing
about the other love of my life.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.548
No, I only talk
to my mom and sister. That's it.

02:54.465 --> 02:55.800
Not your father?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.220
-No, I don't talk to my father.
-Oh.

03:03.641 --> 03:04.726
Let's just say…

03:08.188 --> 03:09.105
We are different.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.068
You're so beautiful.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.421
As thin as cardboard,
these walls.

05:08.766 --> 05:12.437
- My mother is one of a kind.
- Hmm.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.706
Shit.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.711
What I could do
with 20 minutes in this kitchen.

10:36.010 --> 10:40.222
Mama, I made
the risotto with almonds and broccoli.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.224
It's not like yours.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.809
And how is the work?

10:43.893 --> 10:47.021
You didn't tell me, is it
in the town center? Can you walk from--

10:47.104 --> 10:48.314
There is no center here, Mama.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.067
There is no city center here.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.485
No way. Impossible.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.572
Mama, I don't know what
to tell you. That's how it is here.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.862
I'm tired, amore.

14:01.882 --> 14:05.469
- You've been here, what?
-A month.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.805
Just long enough
to not get lost on the bus.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.308
Yes.

14:11.392 --> 14:12.601
A nice little place.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.062
I've heard of it, at least.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.450
Eggplant up and down the menu, I bet.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.581
You're Sicilian, right?

14:37.251 --> 14:38.836
-Yes.
-Ah.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.056
Uh,
that's absolutely no problem.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.100
I'm willing to work my way up.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.452
Damn, that's good.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.240
You're an artist.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.700
- One moment, please.
- Yeah.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.892
- This is polenta.
-Sì.

40:39.812 --> 40:42.314
You're Sicilian?
I'm from Castelleone! Near Cefalù.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.692
Yes! My father is Sicilian!

41:01.375 --> 41:03.419
But where
can I find decent coffee?

41:03.502 --> 41:04.336
I don't know.

41:04.420 --> 41:07.298
And La Repubblica? Americans
don't understand Italian politics.

41:07.381 --> 41:10.676
I don't
half understand it myself.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.429
-I don't understand. Cin cin.
-Cin cin.

45:36.650 --> 45:37.568
Hello.

45:39.111 --> 45:42.990
Listen, Dad. I'm calling with good news.

45:45.409 --> 45:46.452
I'm listening.

45:47.995 --> 45:49.496
Amy and I are getting married.

45:55.919 --> 45:56.754
Hello?

45:58.005 --> 45:58.839
Hello, Papa?

45:59.506 --> 46:00.758
I'm here.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.593
Say something.

46:05.137 --> 46:08.265
It would have been better
if I hadn't answered the phone today.

46:12.853 --> 46:14.480
Papa, what are you saying?

46:15.105 --> 46:16.648
First you leave home,

46:17.316 --> 46:20.194
leave your family's farm
to drop out of school.

46:21.612 --> 46:23.530
And that brought shame to this family.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.158
Then you move to America.

46:28.577 --> 46:29.703
And now this girl.

46:29.787 --> 46:31.038
Amy, Papa.

46:31.830 --> 46:32.790
Her name is Amy.

46:33.582 --> 46:34.792
An American.

46:35.876 --> 46:37.878
I don't know how much more I can take!
