WEBVTT

00:07.132 --> 00:09.342
- Previously
on "The Resort"...

00:09.384 --> 00:11.011
- What is "Pasaje"?

00:11.052 --> 00:13.888
- It must have been important
once 'cause it's right there.

00:13.930 --> 00:16.182
[dramatic music]

00:16.224 --> 00:18.393
- Who's Illán Iberra?

00:18.435 --> 00:21.187
- This mural is my attempt
to preserve my memories.

00:21.229 --> 00:22.605
[thud]
- [gasps]

00:22.647 --> 00:24.524
- Holy shit.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.317
[bell dings]
- Oh, shit.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.820
- What did you do, Alex?
- What did I do?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.197
- What did you do?
- Well, what did I do?

00:31.239 --> 00:34.075
Tell me what the fuck I did!

00:34.117 --> 00:35.952
This isn't the end.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.371
The second half is
a heartbreaker, man.

00:47.422 --> 00:50.050
- Baltasar,
my memory detective,

00:50.091 --> 00:51.718
things are crumbling fast.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.722
I don't know
when I am or when you are.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.974
Uh...

00:58.016 --> 00:59.893
God, I hope I'm not far off.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.895
[tense music]

01:01.936 --> 01:04.898
[birds chirping]

01:04.939 --> 01:12.113
* *

01:41.309 --> 01:46.189
- [echoing]
Alexander Vasilakis.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.191
* *

01:48.233 --> 01:49.734
Where did you come up

01:49.776 --> 01:51.945
with such
a stupid fucking name?

01:51.986 --> 01:55.198
Oceana, Oceana.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.200
[gasps]

01:58.618 --> 02:00.328
Ugh.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.508
[sniffs sharply]

02:15.552 --> 02:18.346
Size 30.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.102
[clattering]

02:24.144 --> 02:31.234
* *

02:35.864 --> 02:37.657
Ha!

02:44.831 --> 02:47.500
- What the fuck was that?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.960
- I think we should
make a run for it.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.505
- What about my pants?
- Fuck your pants.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.300
- Okay,
but they're my only pair.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.351
- Come on.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.894
- Oh, shit.
- Okay.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.730
- Oh, shit.
- Come on.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.773
[piano playing]

03:09.814 --> 03:11.316
- Where do you think
you're going?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.859
- Fuck.

03:12.901 --> 03:18.823
* *

03:18.865 --> 03:21.785
[thunder rumbling]

03:27.374 --> 03:29.501
- I think he's painting us.
- Oh, chill out.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.670
Stop moving your leg.
It's making me nervous.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.921
- I can't.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.214
He smells weird, right?

03:34.255 --> 03:35.548
I can't put my finger on it.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.551
It's like a mix
of blue cheese and patchouli.

03:38.593 --> 03:40.762
- Oh, my God,
I think I'm gonna vomit.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.514
- Please try not to,
because if you vomit,

03:42.555 --> 03:44.099
I'm gonna vomit,
and if we both start--

03:44.140 --> 03:46.226
- Stop talking.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.437
[thunder rumbling]

03:54.025 --> 03:56.986
[upbeat music]

03:57.028 --> 04:03.952
* *

04:16.840 --> 04:18.967
- As you can see,
my investigation

04:19.009 --> 04:22.262
is way more complex and serious
than that useless Silverio.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.930
And, first of all,
I want to say

04:23.972 --> 04:25.974
I'm sorry
for this ridiculous location,

04:26.016 --> 04:27.767
but the resort's business
center is booked,

04:27.809 --> 04:30.520
so their daycare center
will have to do.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.605
- You have everything.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.983
- Oh, yeah, I did my homework.
[chuckles]

04:35.025 --> 04:37.694
So the first question
we need to solve is,

04:37.736 --> 04:40.447
how were you in a painting
that a man with some kind

04:40.488 --> 04:43.450
of amnesia did 15 years ago?

04:43.491 --> 04:46.453
- Yeah.
Where do we start?

04:46.494 --> 04:49.164
- Let's start with Sam's phone.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.957
Do you remember
anything from it?

04:50.999 --> 04:53.918
- You know, I don't think,
besides that photo,

04:53.960 --> 04:55.503
there was much
that was substantial

04:55.545 --> 04:57.380
because there
was flirty texts...

04:57.422 --> 04:59.549
- Mm-hmm.
- There were some cat photos.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.468
- Yeah--oh, and the head.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.511
Sam had some kind
of head injury.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.347
- There was some
skateboarding incident.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.806
- Right, and I think that--

05:06.848 --> 05:10.143
we think that his girlfriend
was cheating on him.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.227
- Hm.
- Mm...

05:11.269 --> 05:12.729
- [chuckles]

05:12.771 --> 05:16.149
Do you recall seeing a picture
of a penis on his phone?

05:16.191 --> 05:17.609
- No, no, no.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.152
I think we would've remembered
something like that.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.528
- Yeah.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.155
- Hm, Sam was looking
a picture of a penis

05:22.197 --> 05:23.740
on his plane over on--

05:23.782 --> 05:26.534
I really believe it
actually belonged to a man

05:26.576 --> 05:29.037
that his girlfriend
was sleeping with.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.497
- I knew it.
- All right, all right.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.873
- Juicy tracksuit--
- All right, all right.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.249
- Like I said.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.170
- You know, I believe
that this entire thing began

05:37.212 --> 05:40.340
with a picture of a penis.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.467
- [snickers]

05:42.509 --> 05:44.135
- [laughs]

05:44.177 --> 05:45.470
- Sorry, I'm 12, okay?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.347
[laughter]

05:47.389 --> 05:48.556
- Where did you find the phone?

05:48.598 --> 05:51.017
- In the jungle.
I was on an ATV tour.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.602
- [speaking Spanish]

05:52.644 --> 05:54.270
The trail of the Naranjal.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.691
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.030
- How did you find it?

06:04.072 --> 06:06.950
- My ATV crashed,
and I fell down this hill.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.576
And then I landed next to it.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.871
- Did you find
anything else there?

06:11.913 --> 06:15.500
You did search the area
for more evidence.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.710
- Oh, well, we were going to--

06:16.751 --> 06:17.836
- Well, I mean that
makes sense to do--

06:17.877 --> 06:19.462
- After Silverio's--
- I think.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.214
- But we just thought--
- God!

06:21.256 --> 06:23.591
Oh, my God, you suck!
You're horrible detectives.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.260
- Whoa, whoa, okay.
- Oh, my God!

06:25.301 --> 06:27.220
- All right, okay, fine, yeah,

06:27.262 --> 06:29.723
but I mean, it's highly
unlikely that anything's

06:29.764 --> 06:31.558
gonna be out there
15 years later.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.892
- Yeah, is it?
Is it really?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.394
Is it really that hard
to believe,

06:34.436 --> 06:36.062
a shoe, a fucking condom.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.983
It's plastic, man.
That's gonna be there forever.

06:40.025 --> 06:43.361
- Okay, we'll go
back there tomorrow.

06:43.403 --> 06:48.158
- Okay, let's--let's move on.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.160
Let's move on.

06:50.201 --> 06:51.995
We know what was on the phone.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.664
And we know where
and how you found it.

06:54.706 --> 06:58.918
But now we need
to figure out why you found it.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.712
- I don't really think
there is a why.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.255
- Oh, no, there's always a why.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.631
And in order to understand why,

07:03.673 --> 07:07.302
I really need
to know you guys better.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.095
Who are you two, hm?

07:09.137 --> 07:12.932
Alex always said,
"Answers are in our memories."

07:17.354 --> 07:20.106
[thunder rumbling]

07:27.447 --> 07:29.783
- Sam, there's a sword.
- What?

07:29.824 --> 07:31.868
- Go get the sword.
- The sword?

07:31.910 --> 07:33.078
- We could, like,
sneak attack him.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.621
And then we could,
like, make a run for it.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.956
- You want to play
with my sword?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.545
[grunts]

07:46.591 --> 07:49.094
"There is
an egoless letting go

07:49.135 --> 07:52.055
that transcends the attachment
to life or death."

07:52.097 --> 07:55.100
What do you think
that means, guys?

07:58.770 --> 08:02.023
[percussive music playing]

08:02.065 --> 08:09.030
* *

08:10.031 --> 08:11.616
So what are you doing
in my room?

08:11.658 --> 08:14.077
- We were just trying to get
my skateboard back, that's all.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.453
- Seems like you're trying
to do a little bit

08:15.495 --> 08:16.579
of a fuck and steal.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.872
- The what?
- A fuck and st--

08:17.914 --> 08:18.915
- You're trying to rob me.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.333
- We weren't trying to rob you.

08:20.375 --> 08:23.503
- No!

08:23.545 --> 08:28.591
What are you doing
in my resort?

08:28.633 --> 08:29.718
- I'm on a vacation
with my family.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.094
- Yeah, no, same.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.096
My dad's, like,
a really intimidating guy.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.639
And he's probably
looking for me right now.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.974
- Yeah.
- So I should really get going.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.810
- Yeah, I doubt that.
Listen,

08:38.852 --> 08:42.272
what do you like
about this place?

08:42.313 --> 08:44.024
* *

08:44.065 --> 08:47.694
- I mean,
you have a wonderful resort.

08:47.736 --> 08:48.862
- We love it.
- You do?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.155
- We really do.
- Mm-hmm.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.156
- Yep, it's--

08:51.197 --> 08:52.240
- Tell me what
you like about it,

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
and I'll let you go.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.952
- Oh, the food.
- I was gonna say the food.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.495
- The food, right?
- Drinks.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.580
- You guys,
don't fucking lie to me.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.581
The food sucks.
- Oh, it's--

08:59.622 --> 09:00.582
- I know it does.
- It's awful.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.417
But honestly--
- It's not great.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.044
- Your drinks are good.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.795
- Okay, whatever.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.714
* *

09:07.756 --> 09:11.384
But what do you love about it?

09:11.426 --> 09:14.721
* *

09:14.763 --> 09:16.389
- I met her.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.766
- And you guys like each other?

09:17.807 --> 09:19.059
Of course you do.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.061
I smelled precum
in your GAP jeans.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.520
- Gross, man.
- Yeah.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.730
- Come on.

09:23.772 --> 09:24.939
- I just wish I could
be young like you

09:24.981 --> 09:27.108
and fall in love again.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.151
Back to business.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.861
People have been stealing
from me.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.947
So I'm gonna need you both
to cough it up,

09:32.989 --> 09:35.408
unload your bags,
your purse, whatever you got.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.660
Come on.
- Yeah.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.287
* *

09:39.329 --> 09:41.664
- Okay, let's see.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.625
* *

09:43.667 --> 09:45.710
Who's Hanna?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.045
Should we send her a pic?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.255
- Please don't.
- Yeah.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.924
Come on.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.926
Get closer together.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.595
Say, "breaking and entering."

09:55.637 --> 09:58.348
Yes,
I don't want to forget that.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.058
This will be useful someday.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.810
All right,
let's see in the bag.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.104
- You know,
there's nothing in my bag.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.939
- Well, it looks like there's
tons of shit in your bag.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.482
- It's my shit.
It's not your shit.

10:07.524 --> 10:08.817
- Could be.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.319
- What are you--

10:12.445 --> 10:13.780
Great.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.532
- What is this?
- We didn't steal anything.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.908
Can I just have that back?

10:16.950 --> 10:20.078
[eerie music]

10:20.120 --> 10:21.705
- What?

10:21.746 --> 10:24.165
[thunder crashing]

10:24.207 --> 10:25.625
* *

10:25.667 --> 10:27.168
- No, I'm just scared!

10:27.210 --> 10:28.837
* *

10:28.878 --> 10:31.256
- It's a condition
called tempus exhaurire.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.590
- What is Pasaje?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.426
- [hisses]

10:34.467 --> 10:35.927
- Where did you get this?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.016
- I need to know everything,

10:41.057 --> 10:42.350
partials and particulars.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.186
Like, how long have
you been together?

10:45.228 --> 10:46.855
- Well, why does that matter?
- Yeah.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.606
- Just, how long have
you been together?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.359
It's a simple question, no?

10:51.401 --> 10:55.822
- Yeah, okay, we've
been married for ten years.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.867
And we met 15 years ago.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.786
- Sam and Violet met
15 years ago too.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.204
Where did you guys meet?

11:03.246 --> 11:05.373
What did you feel the first
time you saw each other?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.917
- Why is that relevant?
- Okay.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.961
Okay, lady,
I'm gonna show you something.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.881
You are in a fucking painting
from 15 years ago.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.507
So as far as I'm concerned,

11:14.549 --> 11:18.053
everything is equally relevant
and irrelevant.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.805
- So you want to share
something with me?

11:24.225 --> 11:26.144
Oh, my God.
Okay, I'm gonna go first.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.063
My name is Baltasar Frías.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.273
I was born in 1975.

11:30.315 --> 11:34.277
My mother says
I was born with this dexterity

11:34.319 --> 11:36.738
that was gonna bring
the Frías into the future.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.406
So when I was ten years old,

11:38.448 --> 11:41.701
I was already sewing
the yellow snake onto garments

11:41.743 --> 11:42.869
for the most rich
and horrible people

11:42.911 --> 11:44.245
in my country.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.956
And that left me
pretty fucking depressed.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.959
And that year, my father,
who was also my best friend,

11:50.001 --> 11:52.504
died unexpectedly.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.423
And then, because of
this horrible incident caused

11:55.465 --> 11:59.094
by this terrible detective
novel called "El Espejo,"

11:59.135 --> 12:02.055
I realized
I could no longer be a Frías.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.391
So I ran away,
and I was adrift

12:04.432 --> 12:08.895
until I found this strange
and sweet man called Alex

12:08.937 --> 12:12.232
who saw in me...

12:12.273 --> 12:14.234
me.

12:17.654 --> 12:21.449
So you see, every single point,
every single turn in my life,

12:21.491 --> 12:24.452
was significant because it
brought me here, now,

12:24.494 --> 12:25.745
in front of you two.

12:25.787 --> 12:30.375
So please just tell me,
how did you guys meet?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.253
- Yeah, okay, I'll bite.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.589
We met at a bonfire
in Huntington Beach.

12:36.631 --> 12:40.844
And we pretty much
hit it off right off the bat.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.012
- Did you fuck
that first night?

12:42.053 --> 12:43.972
- Whoa, okay.
- What?

12:44.014 --> 12:45.140
- It's a simple question.
- Hey.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.266
- It's a simple question.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.434
Does it make you uncomfortable

12:47.475 --> 12:49.144
to talk
about your sexual activity?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.311
- Yes.
[laughter]

12:50.353 --> 12:51.646
It does, with you.
- Oh.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.023
- 'Cause we just met.

12:53.064 --> 12:56.067
- Yeah, and I just put
my whole heart and soul

12:56.109 --> 12:57.736
onto a platter for you.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.237
- You share too much.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.575
- Okay.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.036
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
whatever, whatever.

13:06.077 --> 13:08.288
We hooked up.
- How was it?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.790
- No, I--okay.
- I mean, we're still together.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.167
- Yeah.
- So do the math.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.335
- How many times did you
do it that first night?

13:13.376 --> 13:14.878
- It's fucking ridiculous.
- Wait!

13:14.919 --> 13:16.087
- I'm just trying
to break the ice.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.213
I'm just trying
to break the ice, okay?

13:17.255 --> 13:19.215
- Four times, four times.
- Noah, Noah.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.009
- I--yeah, I--
- That's my record too.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.886
- What are you doing?
- I'm on vacation.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.971
I don't know.
- Okay, let's move on.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.724
And then what?
Then you fall in love.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.142
You get married.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.685
What has been
the highest point

13:30.727 --> 13:32.187
in your marriage so far?

13:32.228 --> 13:35.607
- Well, I'd say the marriage.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.359
The marriage--the wedding.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.527
The wedding was--
it was pretty special.

13:39.569 --> 13:40.695
- Yeah.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.073
- What about the lowest point?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.000
- We were really broke
when we first got married

13:54.042 --> 13:55.085
because I didn't have a job,

13:55.126 --> 13:56.544
and we had a lot
of financial stress.

13:56.586 --> 14:01.549
And we got through it.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.051
- Financial stress?

14:03.093 --> 14:05.845
- That was the lowest point?

14:05.887 --> 14:08.765
- You wouldn't understand that.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.559
You were born rich.
- Ouch.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.103
- [laughs]

14:13.144 --> 14:15.480
Yeah, it's
very expensive to survive.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.899
Can we get back to the phone?
- Yeah, sure.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.275
Let's go back to the phone.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.861
Why didn't you turn in
the phone to the police

14:21.903 --> 14:23.238
when you found it?

14:23.279 --> 14:25.073
- Now I'm thinking
that I should have.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.866
- Yeah, yeah, I'm with her.

14:26.908 --> 14:30.328
I mean, we're just,
you know, just trying to help.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.996
- Do you like to help her?

14:32.038 --> 14:34.124
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

14:34.165 --> 14:37.544
- Did she ask you
for your help?

14:37.585 --> 14:40.463
- She--mm.

14:40.505 --> 14:44.467
[tense music]

14:45.969 --> 14:48.930
- I wanted your help.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.224
- Did you, really?
- Yeah.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.477
Yeah, I did.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.272
- Hm.
It's getting tense, no?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.565
- Okay,
that's enough for tonight.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.316
- No, no, no, no, no,
just one more question.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.902
Emma,
you said you fell off your ATV,

15:02.944 --> 15:06.156
and then you landed, no?

15:06.197 --> 15:09.284
What did you feel
when you first saw the phone?

15:09.325 --> 15:11.369
- I was confused,
and then I was like,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.163
why is there
an old phone out here?

15:13.204 --> 15:15.540
- Anything else?
You felt any other emotion?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.751
* *

15:17.792 --> 15:19.377
- No.
- Nothing?

15:19.419 --> 15:21.963
- No, nothing.
- Wow.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.256
I was wrong.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.674
I thought
Noah was gonna be tough,

15:24.716 --> 15:27.052
but you are a fortress.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.013
- Thank you.

15:30.055 --> 15:33.308
- Why is this
your mystery to solve?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.852
- Why is it yours?
- I ask you first.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.479
- [scoffs]

15:37.520 --> 15:41.649
I just--I'm trying to find,
you know, closure.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.069
I'm trying to bring closure
to these parents.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.529
- What did you lose?

15:50.658 --> 15:52.327
- There's a reason
I'm asking these questions.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.829
Every single person
in this lost something

15:54.871 --> 15:56.206
or someone they loved.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.625
And then they all ended up
in the Oceana Vista.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.044
You know,
they lost a fucking skateboard,

16:01.086 --> 16:04.506
a family member,
memory, a home, a phone.

16:04.547 --> 16:07.467
Can't you see that?
Loss is the common denominator.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.302
- Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.680
Everyone loses something
that they love at some point.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.932
- Yeah, but did you know

16:13.973 --> 16:16.476
that Violet lost her mother

16:16.518 --> 16:19.729
one year
before she disappeared?

16:19.771 --> 16:22.732
- No, I didn't.

16:22.774 --> 16:25.235
* *

16:25.276 --> 16:28.530
- I know that look
in your eyes.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.658
I recognized it
the minute I met you.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.160
What did you lose?

16:34.202 --> 16:41.334
* *

16:53.054 --> 16:54.764
- [gasps]

17:01.312 --> 17:04.274
Do you really want to go
with him tomorrow?

17:04.315 --> 17:07.652
- Yeah, yeah, I do.
Why, do you not?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.238
- I saw Sam and Violet's
parents' phone numbers

17:10.280 --> 17:12.407
in one of the binders.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.451
And I think that,
you know, yeah, we can go.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.202
And if we don't see anything,
which I don't think

17:16.244 --> 17:17.454
that we're going to,

17:17.495 --> 17:18.580
and we can just put it
behind us,

17:18.621 --> 17:21.291
I think,
you know, and call them.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.795
- Okay, yeah, I guess, yeah.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.008
Hey, are you doing all right?

17:30.050 --> 17:32.761
- Yeah.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.929
Are you?

17:34.971 --> 17:37.057
- Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine.

17:37.098 --> 17:41.603
I just--I guess I just hadn't
thought about it in a while.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.605
- Yeah.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.530
- What are you doing?

17:52.572 --> 17:54.282
- Who the fuck are you?

17:54.324 --> 17:55.950
And are you fucking with me?

17:55.992 --> 17:59.204
- What are you talking about?

17:59.245 --> 18:01.414
- This book is about me.
- No, it isn't.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.792
- I am Alejandro.
I am in this book.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.960
My name is Alex.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.796

18:07.837 --> 18:10.632
Look at this, "Alejandro
woke up on the beach.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.842
"And he witnessed
the beginning of the end.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.679
"With his retirement
came an unruly beard

"that his retirement
would be short-lived.

"And what
you will soon find out is

"that his next investigation
will truly be his last.

Alejandro will reach
the end of the line."

18:34.239 --> 18:36.574
I'm Alejandro.
This is about me.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.785
- Because you
also have a beard?

18:38.827 --> 18:40.954
- No, it's not
because I have a beard.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.331
You don't understand.
- You're psychotic.

to get our phones back,

just to check in
with our parents,

20:23.848 --> 20:25.016
so they don't think
we've been kidnapped.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.518
- No mames.

You'd tell your parents
that I actually did kidnap you.

bad sex, so, so much regret.

Yeah, I was in love once.

21:35.003 --> 21:37.589
- So, what, now we walk around
to try to find some bones?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.716
- Good idea.
Let's split in pairs.

21:39.758 --> 21:41.885
You and Noah,
you go follow the trail.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.845
And Emma and I,
we will go down the hill.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.513
- Or, Noah, you and I can go,

21:45.555 --> 21:48.058
and then you guys can--

21:48.099 --> 21:50.393
- No, no, that's okay.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.520
I can go with Luna.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.231
[soft tense music]

21:55.273 --> 21:57.192
- Okay.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.403
- Okay.

22:00.445 --> 22:06.159
* *

22:06.201 --> 22:10.914
- I am pretty sure

22:10.955 --> 22:13.458
it was here.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.001
- Here?

22:15.043 --> 22:17.629
You have
the original phone, right?

22:17.671 --> 22:19.547
* *

22:19.589 --> 22:21.049
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.592
Put it where it was.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.261
* *

22:25.303 --> 22:27.472
- Okay.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.433
Um...

22:30.475 --> 22:35.605
I was there, I think.

22:35.647 --> 22:39.567
- Are you sure it wasn't,
like, there?

22:39.609 --> 22:42.821
Try to be specific.

22:42.862 --> 22:46.408
- Okay, it was, uh...

22:46.449 --> 22:53.581
* *

22:59.963 --> 23:01.256
- Good!
- It was right there.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.799
- Good, and where were you
when you saw it?

23:02.841 --> 23:04.551
- Uh, here-ish.
- Mm-hmm.

23:04.592 --> 23:07.178
Yeah, you were
laying down, no?

23:07.220 --> 23:10.223

23:10.265 --> 23:11.766
[upbeat music playing]

23:11.808 --> 23:15.228
- This guy's fucking nuts.
- Looks like an alien.

23:15.270 --> 23:16.813
- What the fuck is going on?

23:16.855 --> 23:17.981
- What do we do?
Do we try to ditch him?

23:18.023 --> 23:19.149
- He has my book.
- Shit.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.359
- And he has our phones.
- That's right.

23:21.401 --> 23:28.533
* *

23:29.117 --> 23:31.119
I'm really sorry
about your mom.

23:31.161 --> 23:34.164
* *

23:34.205 --> 23:37.876
- Thanks, me too.

23:39.002 --> 23:42.005
- [echoing]
What the fuck is going on?

23:42.047 --> 23:44.174
- She was really sick
for a while.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.343
For whatever reason,
the last couple of weeks,

23:46.384 --> 23:48.678
I couldn't get myself
to step foot in her room

23:48.720 --> 23:50.597
to say goodbye to her.

23:50.638 --> 23:53.183
I don't know.
Maybe I was just scared

23:53.224 --> 23:56.019
to remember her like that,
or maybe,

23:56.061 --> 23:58.438
it was just easier
to not go in.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.607
It's pretty fucked up.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.109
- I don't think so.

24:03.151 --> 24:07.572
- I wish
I asked her more questions.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.199
- Sorry about last night.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.658
Baltasar means well,

24:10.700 --> 24:12.786
but he doesn't know
when to back off.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.205
- Well, yeah, I mean,
he wasn't totally off base.

24:15.246 --> 24:17.040
[soft music]

24:17.082 --> 24:21.670
Emma and I actually lost a kid.

24:21.711 --> 24:24.130
- Oh, no.
- A baby girl.

24:24.172 --> 24:27.550
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

24:27.592 --> 24:28.885
It's fine.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.470
- Let's try
to focus on the memory.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.554
Let's try--
- This is so stupid.

24:31.596 --> 24:32.889
- Mm.

24:32.931 --> 24:34.557
- I don't understand
how this is helpful.

24:34.599 --> 24:36.518
- I think you do.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.811
- Okay.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.563
- Don't you feel something
deeper happening?

24:40.605 --> 24:42.524
For some reason,
this is the place

24:42.565 --> 24:45.819
where your life intersected
with Sam's and Violet's.

24:45.860 --> 24:47.779
Is it a completely
random coincidence?

24:47.821 --> 24:50.365
Maybe, maybe not, hm?

24:51.866 --> 24:53.910
- You're suggesting
I was meant to find the phone.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.286
- I'm not suggesting anything.

24:55.328 --> 24:57.038
I'm just saying
that every single moment

24:57.080 --> 24:59.624
in your life led to this point.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.419
There are no isolated moments.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.796
They are all significant,

25:04.838 --> 25:07.799
even if you
don't think that way.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.346
- Okay.

25:13.388 --> 25:16.307
* *

25:16.349 --> 25:18.518
- Good.

25:18.560 --> 25:23.606
Now, maybe if...

25:23.648 --> 25:25.692
you allow yourself
to remember...

25:25.734 --> 25:26.943
- Mm-hmm.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.486
- You might learn
something new.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.697
- About what?
- About you.

25:30.739 --> 25:34.659
* *

25:34.701 --> 25:37.579
Let's go back
to the exact moment.

25:37.620 --> 25:42.000
* *

25:42.042 --> 25:43.668
What did you feel
when you opened your eyes?

- [sighs]

25:45.253 --> 25:50.300
* *

25:50.342 --> 25:55.472
- Yeah, the baby made it
about an hour, 63 minutes.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.057
* *

25:57.098 --> 25:59.434
And Emma never got to meet her.

25:59.476 --> 26:02.812
I mean, I got this memory
of this beautiful, perfect,

26:02.854 --> 26:05.482
pudgy little face,
and Emma doesn't.

26:05.523 --> 26:09.819
And that seems cruel.

26:09.861 --> 26:13.448
- What do you want, Emma, hm?

26:13.490 --> 26:15.283
- Nothing.

26:15.325 --> 26:17.577
* *

26:17.619 --> 26:19.662
- What do you need?

26:19.704 --> 26:23.792
* *

26:23.833 --> 26:26.169
- I'm fine.

26:26.211 --> 26:28.838
* *

26:28.880 --> 26:33.551
- What are you hoping
to find?

26:33.593 --> 26:36.137
- I don't think
this is working.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.106
- Sorry I scared you.
I scare myself sometimes.

26:46.147 --> 26:47.816
Listen, I think I remember
what I'm supposed

26:47.857 --> 26:49.275
to remember right now.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.069
And it's--I'm starting
to understand everything.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.404
Thank you for that book.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.531
It has shed a light
on a lot of things.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.866
And I think there's still time
that I can help.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.868
So--
- Help what?

26:58.910 --> 27:00.328
- Help you.

27:00.370 --> 27:02.455
Do not go to Pasaje.
- What?

27:02.497 --> 27:05.583
- Turn around, go home.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.461
- What are you talking about?

27:08.503 --> 27:09.921
- Fly, children.
- Where are you going?

27:09.963 --> 27:11.256
- Fly where?
- Go!

- What--go where?
- Go home!

27:27.480 --> 27:30.025
- Baltasar,
my memory detective,

27:30.066 --> 27:31.901
things are crumbling fast.

27:31.943 --> 27:35.655
I don't know when I am
or when you are.

27:35.697 --> 27:39.034
- Okay, this is clearly not
an ATV trail, so--

27:39.075 --> 27:40.910
- Should we just go back?
- Yeah, let's go back.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.245
- Yeah, let's go back.

27:42.287 --> 27:45.123
- God, I hope I'm not far off.

27:45.165 --> 27:47.208
- And after Alex died,

27:47.250 --> 27:48.793
I just left
and never looked back.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.962
But here I am again.
Ha!

27:51.004 --> 27:53.882
- Violet and... Swimmy?

27:53.923 --> 27:55.842
Whatever.
He had a forgettable name.

to find Illán Iberra.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.391
God, I hope they didn't.

28:03.433 --> 28:06.144
- Yeah, it's weird
how everything just comes

I'm sure I'll see you soon,

28:12.984 --> 28:15.653

what I'm talking about.
