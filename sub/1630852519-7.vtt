WEBVTT

00:02.915 --> 00:04.526
[clattering]

00:04.569 --> 00:06.310
- Any interest in a part-time
resident practice?

00:06.354 --> 00:08.660
Who better than someone
who knows what it's like
to be a cardiac?

00:08.704 --> 00:09.792
- I don't think so.

00:09.835 --> 00:12.099
It's not fair,
how you see me.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.841
- You're a fighter June,
I get that.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.147
- What are you telling me
to do here?

00:17.191 --> 00:19.584
- I'm not, I'm just pointing out
the landmines.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.066
- Are you free tonight?
- You're asking me on a date?

00:23.110 --> 00:25.155
- You had two major health
incidents.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.809
[Claire]: They're pushing
you out?

00:26.852 --> 00:28.332
- I'm not done, Claire.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.334
[in Arabic]:

00:35.035 --> 00:37.211
[prayer in Arabic]

00:41.737 --> 00:44.174
[Majid]: Welcome Brothers.
Couple of quick announcements.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.829
Unfortunately we begin
by offering our condolences

00:46.872 --> 00:50.006
to brother Karif Shahid,
who recently lost his father.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.443
So we pray that Allah
grants him mercy

00:52.487 --> 00:54.750
and gives him the highest
place in paradise.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.058
[muffled voice]:
In times of isolation,

00:58.101 --> 01:00.625
we look towards
our community for peace.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.634
[city rumble]

01:16.511 --> 01:19.514
- Hey, those stitches
still need to come out.

01:20.819 --> 01:23.779
Maybe tomorrow after school
you stop by the hospital?

01:24.127 --> 01:26.695
- Rania's coming to get
some things.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.525
- We're friends, Amira.

01:30.568 --> 01:33.136
She's still in both
of our lives.

01:38.359 --> 01:39.925
[sigh]

01:40.491 --> 01:43.103
[sirens blaring
in the distance]

01:45.714 --> 01:47.803
[gentle music]

02:03.732 --> 02:04.646
- What time is it?

02:04.689 --> 02:06.909
- It's late or early,

02:06.952 --> 02:08.737
depending on your point
of view.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.651
- You're working?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.480
- Yeah, I'm unwinding.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.483
- Unwinding.

02:16.701 --> 02:18.312
With Electro Cardiography
Interpretation?

02:18.355 --> 02:20.270
- Okay, unless you can show me
how to sleep

02:20.314 --> 02:21.967
like a stress-free toddler,
yes, that is--

02:22.011 --> 02:24.274
- I have stress! I stress!
- Mm-hmm.

02:24.318 --> 02:29.497
- But I also just had a really
good stress reliever.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.848
[laughing]

02:33.588 --> 02:35.198
- Okay.

02:36.895 --> 02:39.202
- Is that you?
- Mm-hmm.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.074
What stresses do you have?

02:42.423 --> 02:46.775
- Well, still trying to impress
Dr. Hunter, that's one.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.080
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.082
- You never seemed to worry
about that.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.172
- It's future Jake's problem.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.827
Current Jake is worried
about how he's gonna sleep

02:55.871 --> 02:57.481
with the light on.

03:00.702 --> 03:02.356
[sighing]

03:04.358 --> 03:06.360
Unless you want me to go?

03:09.232 --> 03:10.668
It's okay, I can go.

03:15.064 --> 03:17.936
Try and get some sleep,
weirdo.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.203
[gentle music]

03:35.215 --> 03:36.781
[city hubbub]

03:39.567 --> 03:40.568
- Hey.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.178
- Oh, do you need
your office back?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.658
- This isn't my office
this morning.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.268
Actually, I'm not even here.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.487
[chuckling]

03:46.530 --> 03:48.532
- Soap me.
- Excuse me?

03:48.576 --> 03:51.318
- Mnemonic device for
rapid sequence intubation.

03:51.361 --> 03:54.712
Suction, O2,
Airways, Positioning.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.759
- Medication and Equipment.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.848
- That's it.
- The exam's at noon?

03:59.891 --> 04:02.546
- Yes. Oh, I called in
for supplementals,

04:02.590 --> 04:04.418
but somebody had to cancel,
so I told Rhoda

04:04.461 --> 04:06.115
if she needs anything,
just text.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.247
- We'll be fine, Claire.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.987
Go kill it.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.343
- 32-year-old found down,
incoming.

04:18.301 --> 04:19.563
- You paged me Rhoda?
- Sorry.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.565
By mistake, it's not
a pedes trauma.

04:21.608 --> 04:23.350
I'm filling in for Claire
and we're just already swamped.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.960
- I have a window
if you need help.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.396
- We're good.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.572
- Fall from a ladder,
multiple contusions!

04:28.616 --> 04:31.880
BP's 100 over 80,
rate's 130. GCS 10.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.403
- You're a doctor?
- Yes, Kelsey's my daughter!

04:33.447 --> 04:35.275
I found her on the floor
of the bar she owns.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.841
She closed it to renovate.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.408
[indistinct shout]

04:38.452 --> 04:41.281
I did a quick neurological exam,
but she'll need a CT.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.848
I don't know how long
she's been there.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.372
- Two large bore IVs!

04:45.415 --> 04:47.025
- E-FAST.
Start with her chest?

04:48.070 --> 04:50.159
[dramatic music]

04:50.768 --> 04:52.944
Ray Grisholm.
Internist at Midcrest.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.598
I would've got her there,
but it's a 20-minute ride.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.426
- This is Dr. Bishop,
Chief of our emerg--

04:56.470 --> 04:58.080
- I saw you at the
Trauma Association conference

04:58.123 --> 04:59.777
a few years ago.
Is there any free fluid?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.605
- Your daughter is
in very good hands, sir.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.346
- Fast positive.
Belly full of blood.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.783
- We'll give her a gram of TXA
and activate MTP!

05:05.827 --> 05:07.437
- I'm calling the blood bank!
- No, no.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.352
She's AB negative, same as me!
You can use mine now!

05:09.396 --> 05:10.527
- That's not something
that we do.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.355
- Well, she's not
hemodynamically stable!

05:13.138 --> 05:15.227
Have either one of you
ever done a direct transfusion?

05:15.271 --> 05:16.751
- I have.
- I've got a donor card

05:16.794 --> 05:19.057
in my wallet
if you need to confirm.

05:19.754 --> 05:21.538
- Set up for a direct
transfusion.

05:21.582 --> 05:24.149
Let's take every step we can,
Dr. Grisholm.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.716
- Thank you.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.370
Thank you.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.546
- Guy brought his wife in
after a car accident.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.287
He's dazed, a little bit
cut up and she's--

05:31.331 --> 05:33.071
[woman screaming]
Well...

05:33.115 --> 05:34.899
- Displaced leg fracture

05:34.943 --> 05:37.075
and when's the last time
you delivered a baby?

05:37.946 --> 05:38.990
- Is she okay?

05:39.034 --> 05:40.557
And after you answer that,
please,

05:40.601 --> 05:42.385
tell me I can still get
the epidural!

05:42.429 --> 05:44.474
- Fetal heart rate's 140.
I paged OB, but--

05:44.518 --> 05:46.737
- It's okay, I'm on it.
Contractions are how far apart?

05:46.781 --> 05:49.827
- Not very! Ben was supposed
to time them, but...

05:49.871 --> 05:52.700
[screaming]
- It's really happening now?

05:53.396 --> 05:55.093
I just thought
the accident might--

05:55.137 --> 05:56.660
- What, push it back in, Ben?

05:56.704 --> 06:00.229
Go find someone
who can get me an epidural!

06:00.272 --> 06:02.623
- You two got in an accident
on your way to have a baby?

06:02.666 --> 06:05.190
- Ben ran a red...
- You were yelling at me!

06:05.234 --> 06:06.844
- Oh.
- I'm trying here, Tess.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.542
- Jake, ultrasound.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.894
- Oh...
- Her stomach's bleeding.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.504
Tess, oh!
- Ben!

06:14.548 --> 06:16.724
Remember, we took
those classes

06:16.767 --> 06:19.204
about how your one job
is to stay calm?

06:19.248 --> 06:22.469
Yeah? I need you to do
your job, Ben!

06:23.557 --> 06:25.515
My baby's gonna be okay,
right?

06:25.559 --> 06:27.212
- It's not deep,
just oozing.

06:27.778 --> 06:31.347
- Grab me a pair of forceps and
a vacuum just in case, Arnold.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.393
- Got it.
- Okay.

06:33.436 --> 06:36.744
Baby's heartrate looks good,
but it is sunny-side-up.

06:36.787 --> 06:40.443
Which is what Jake?
- Occiput posterior position.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.184
- Is that bad?
- For the baby, no.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.230
For mom, it could mean
a tougher delivery,

06:45.274 --> 06:46.710
but to answer
your question, Tessa,

06:46.754 --> 06:48.320
I have to get you
in position to push,

06:48.364 --> 06:51.672
there's no time for an epidural,
this baby is on its way now!

06:51.715 --> 06:54.457
You're ready?
And one, two, three!

06:54.501 --> 06:57.155
[screaming in pain]

07:00.115 --> 07:01.682
[steady beeping]

07:01.725 --> 07:03.945
- Sorry about
the heavy hand before.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.905
I had a boss who used
to say,

07:07.949 --> 07:11.039
"What this situation needs
is two of me and none of you."

07:11.082 --> 07:12.214
[chuckles lightly]

07:12.257 --> 07:14.085
I maybe followed a little
too closely

07:14.129 --> 07:16.653
in his footsteps.
- Pelvic fracture wrapped.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.176
- You're both what year?

07:18.220 --> 07:21.353
- I'm emerg PGY-two.
- I'm PGY-one.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.877
- But this is
his second residency.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.531
He was a trauma surgeon
in Syria.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.968
- Oh so you're ahead
of your peers, but also
behind them?

07:27.882 --> 07:30.058
It's a good thing Kelsey
isn't awake to see this.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.234
She hates it when I insert
myself in her life.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.323
- I'm guessing this is one time
she'd make an exception.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.934
- You know, I told her
that the bar would be
the death of her,

07:36.978 --> 07:38.501
I meant it was a money pit,
not this.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.547
- You said you didn't know
how long she was alone?

07:40.590 --> 07:43.506
- I knew she was trying to get
the place ready to re-open

07:43.550 --> 07:45.900
and we hadn't talked in
a few days.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.511
She used to always call
her mom, but...

07:48.555 --> 07:52.036
We buried her a month ago.
Ovarian cancer.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.038
- I'm sorry.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.867
- When it happens,

07:56.911 --> 08:00.741
you're distracted.
Then... everybody goes.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.484
We're still figuring out...

08:04.527 --> 08:07.051
not having her mom
as our bridge.

08:09.532 --> 08:10.968
- Temp's 39.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.753
- I'd feel a lot better
if her temp wasn't so high.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.886
- It could be an inflammatory
response due to the trauma.

08:15.930 --> 08:18.541
We'll get Kelsey up
to interventional radiology

08:18.585 --> 08:21.501
for an angio-embolization
to stop the pelvic bleed,

08:21.544 --> 08:23.546
and after that,
just let her rest.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.548
[Tessa screams]

08:25.592 --> 08:27.028
- Okay, the baby's
crowning, mom.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.509
I just need a couple more
pushes, okay?

08:30.379 --> 08:31.989
- Hang in there, Tess.
- Shut up.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.687
- I thought
I was supposed to--

08:33.730 --> 08:35.993
- No, no, no, don't speak,
don't move,

08:36.037 --> 08:37.472
don't even look at me!

08:37.517 --> 08:40.607
- Okay, Tessa,
let's try one more big push!

08:40.650 --> 08:42.826
- I can't, I can't,
I just can't anymore!

08:42.870 --> 08:44.915
[sobbing]
It hurts too much.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.657
Please, can you just
cut it out of me.

08:47.701 --> 08:51.095
My stomach's already bleeding,
you could use that opening.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.881
- The delivery I remember
the most was my youngest.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.361
My wife was up all night
with our oldest

08:56.405 --> 08:57.754
who was sick
with a stomach flu.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.495
She called me to tell me
she was in labour,

08:59.539 --> 09:02.106
but she couldn't leave
Abby home alone to come
to the hospital.

09:02.150 --> 09:05.457
So I drove like a maniac
and got there just in time

09:05.501 --> 09:07.938
to deliver Grace
on our kitchen floor.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.158
It was insane,
just like this.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.376
- Yeah?
- Okay.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.987
When we look back on it now,
we laugh.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.555
You two will have
the same kind of story!

09:15.598 --> 09:17.513
- I don't know...
- Yes, you will.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.820
- But Tessa, believe me.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.953
You've got this.
I need you to push. Okay?

09:22.997 --> 09:25.608
- Come on, you can do this.
Push.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.349
[screaming]
- Here she is, she's coming.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.133
She's coming,
she's coming.

09:29.177 --> 09:32.267
[baby crying]
Here she is. Here she is.

09:33.747 --> 09:36.314
[sobbing]
Here she is.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.143
[loud thud]

09:39.187 --> 09:40.623
[sobbing happily]

09:40.667 --> 09:42.277
- That's a man down.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.932
- Seriously?
- We'll check him out.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.890
You did it.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.326
Okay.

09:49.110 --> 09:50.285
Congratulations!

09:50.328 --> 09:51.895
- I already gave her
the head laceration.

09:51.939 --> 09:53.636
- The fractured wrist went
to imaging,

09:53.680 --> 09:55.420
back pain's on deck,

09:55.464 --> 09:58.728
Bash has a found down
in two and...

09:58.772 --> 10:00.948
- Have you been able
to find Peter?

10:00.991 --> 10:03.080
- Still looking, love.
Dementia.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.908
Doesn't know Peter's last name,
or how to reach him.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.432
[sighing]
- Okay. I'll get him back
to his room.

10:07.476 --> 10:08.956
Sir?

10:08.999 --> 10:10.871
- Hey. If you guys are swamped,
I can grab a patient.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.569
- Nausea in D?
Already been there awhile.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.832
[phone ringing]
York emergency!

10:15.876 --> 10:17.617
- Shouldn't be too long.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.010
- Ms. Crawford?

10:20.054 --> 10:22.665
Hi, I'm Dr. Curtis. I heard
you're feeling nauseated.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.754
- Nothing'll stay down.
Even water.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.103
I was trying to ride it out.

10:26.147 --> 10:27.931
- She refused to go
to the doctor.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.673
- But then the cramping started,
and my sister strong-armed me.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.763
- Sometimes severe food
poisoning can cause dehydration.

10:33.807 --> 10:36.505
- Actually, I had a gastric
bypass three months ago.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.289
I've been sick on and off
ever since.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.031
Before you ask, yes,
I stick to the diet plan.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.339
Yes, I exercise, no, I don't
have high blood pressure,

10:44.382 --> 10:45.819
diabetes,
or heart problems.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.430
- So about this bypass,
did you have that done here?

10:48.473 --> 10:50.650
- Yes.
Dr. Evelyn Roche.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.917
- Okay, well, sometimes,
after a bypass,

10:56.960 --> 10:59.920
our stomach will react
by rapidly emptying food

10:59.963 --> 11:01.486
in a way that can
make you feel sick.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.401
- Dumping syndrome.
I'm aware.

11:03.445 --> 11:06.448
That's only supposed
to happen if you reintroduce
food too fast,

11:06.491 --> 11:09.451
but I've been following
the eye-dropper meal plan
like a zealot.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.322
- Did you let them know that
in your postop visit?

11:11.366 --> 11:14.195
- All Roche said was
my system will only adjust

11:14.238 --> 11:17.328
when I commit to the lifestyle.
Didn't even run a single test.

11:17.372 --> 11:20.941
- Right. Well, Dr. Roche
is a renowned surgeon.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.508
- She's also a jerk, who
has a problem with fat people.

11:23.552 --> 11:24.988
- Maya!
- What can I say.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.686
The woman contains multitudes.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.339
- I'm gonna order a CT.

11:28.383 --> 11:32.039
- You will?
- I can't rule out rapid
gastric emptying,

11:32.082 --> 11:34.911
but we should consider other
post-surgical complications,

11:34.955 --> 11:38.306
like a bowel obstruction, or
another acute digestive problem.

11:38.349 --> 11:40.351
In the meantime, I'm gonna
get you some fluids

11:40.395 --> 11:41.483
and an anti-nauseant.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.006
You'll need to change
into a gown.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.921
- I'll need a second one
to wrap around the back.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.836
- I'll get you one, hon.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.407
You shouldn't have done that.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.801
- Excuse me?
- Given her false hope.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.977
- So you wanted me to tell her
to exercise and eat right?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.761
Because it seems like
she's already doing that.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.241
- Maya needs to hear
this is normal

12:00.284 --> 12:02.547
and that she just needs to get
through the worst of it.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.245
But when you don't find
something,

12:04.288 --> 12:07.291
I'll have to pick her up and
get her back on track.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.468
- Is there anything else?

12:10.512 --> 12:13.036
- Yes. Who can I ask
for a gown?

12:13.907 --> 12:16.300
- Here, this desk.
- Okay.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.565
[automated voice]: At the end
of your message, press 1.

12:20.609 --> 12:21.653
[beep]

12:21.697 --> 12:23.177
- I know you're
screening me, Mel.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.875
We need to talk about
you wanting sole custody.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.659
We only speak now
through lawyers,

12:27.703 --> 12:29.226
and every time I go
for pick up or drop off

12:29.270 --> 12:31.446
your mom's there just
glaring at me.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.405
I don't understand why
you're treating me like this.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.755
[clears throat]

12:40.977 --> 12:42.936
[sighs]
What is it, Jake?

12:42.979 --> 12:46.591
- Ben Lyons is still complaining
about left upper quadrant pain.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.637
Chest X-ray for pneumothorax

12:48.680 --> 12:50.334
and broken ribs came
back normal.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.596
- Okay?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.076
- You said to rule those
two things out.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.123
- Yes, I did. Can you think
of any other organs

12:56.166 --> 12:58.908
in that quadrant which might be
affected by blunt trauma?

12:58.952 --> 13:00.823
- Kidney, spleen, pancreas.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.564
But you didn't say
to rule those out.

13:04.827 --> 13:05.959
Ultrasound?

13:06.002 --> 13:09.310
- CT with contrast.
- CT with contrast.

13:12.704 --> 13:16.404
- So what this situation
calls for is two of you
and none of him?

13:16.447 --> 13:19.450
- You're defending him?
- No, I mean...

13:19.494 --> 13:21.801
You know, you could've walked
him through your thinking.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.498
- I have, Mags.
More than once.

13:23.541 --> 13:26.022
He's gotta start showing up
for work, which means

13:26.066 --> 13:28.329
coming to me with answers
instead of questions.

13:28.372 --> 13:31.419
- Kelsey Grisholm?
- Her bleed's under control,

13:31.462 --> 13:34.291
but her temp's still high.
- We're waiting on labs.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.640
- And her father?

13:35.684 --> 13:37.120
- Still insistent
about being looped-in.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.861
- I want you both
to stay on this.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.950
Ray's pretty senior
at Midcrest and eh,

13:40.994 --> 13:43.170
easier for all of us
if he's managed.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.482
- Bash?

13:53.049 --> 13:56.096
About the thing that
we're not...

13:56.139 --> 13:58.707
About the elevator
and like...

13:58.750 --> 14:00.883
That had nothing to do
with you. Okay?

14:00.927 --> 14:02.798
[stammering]

14:02.842 --> 14:05.845
The person in there
wasn't even me really.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.238
- Who was it?

14:09.936 --> 14:12.547
- Someone who'd had a
messed up day and a messed up...

14:12.590 --> 14:14.201
few months.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.639
- You're not alone there.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.249
Listen, I...

14:19.293 --> 14:22.644
I don't want it to get
between us either so...

14:23.863 --> 14:25.995
Let's just pretend it
never happened.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.563
- Exactly what I was gonna say.

14:32.045 --> 14:35.135
[Ray]: You really gave me
a scare, kid. What happened?

14:35.178 --> 14:36.788
- I was painting
the crown moulding.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.355
- I told you to call
the contractor.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.488
- I told you I wanted
to do it myself.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.707
- How are you feeling now?

14:43.273 --> 14:46.450
- Ah headache,
neck's a bit stiff,

14:46.494 --> 14:48.975
but I guess that's what happens
when you lie

14:49.018 --> 14:50.367
on the concrete
for a few hours.

14:50.411 --> 14:53.370
- We did a CT,
no intracranial injury.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.764
- So, you just fell?

14:55.807 --> 14:57.679
- Dad. The world
is an imperfect place.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.333
People fall.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.682
- There's, uh...

15:00.725 --> 15:03.554
concern because
you're maintaining a high fever,

15:03.598 --> 15:05.165
and we'd like to know why.

15:05.208 --> 15:08.864
- Were you feeling unwell
before this? Any dizziness?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.692
- She's always run down.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.520
Barely eats,
works until 2:00 AM,

15:12.563 --> 15:14.391
pouring all her energy
into slinging drinks.

15:14.435 --> 15:15.958
- I'm not bartending,
I'm running a business.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.004
- Look, that lifestyle
was fine in your 20s,

15:18.047 --> 15:19.266
but it's time to grow up!

15:19.309 --> 15:21.398
- We can give you a minute--
- No, it's fine.

15:23.052 --> 15:25.141
You may as well all hear this.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.842
I have ALS.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.019
That's why I fell.

15:33.802 --> 15:36.109
I found out near
the end with Mom.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.244
- No, that can't be right,
because...

15:41.288 --> 15:43.594
Wait a minute, you're not
showing any of the signs.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.031
- I've been covering.

15:45.074 --> 15:48.773
I noticed I was having
a hard time gripping things.

15:48.817 --> 15:50.950
I ignored it
at first, but...

15:52.342 --> 15:55.171
Then I started having
weakness in my legs.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.087
- Do you know
how advanced it is?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.396
- The neurologist said that
I should expect more trouble

16:02.439 --> 16:06.052
with mobility and eating
as I enter the mid-stage...

16:06.095 --> 16:09.751
And the average survival rate
is two to five years.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.667
So I guess...
that's where we are.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.974
- Which neurologist?
What's his name?

16:15.017 --> 16:16.627
- Dr. Vedder.
She's been great.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.934
- Never heard of her.
Joe Yoshida is a great
neurologist.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.283
I'll call him and
get a second opinion.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.459
- Dr. Vedder's done weeks
of tests. She's sure.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.113
- Honey, you gotta
trust me here.

16:24.157 --> 16:25.810
I can help us get
to the bottom of this.

16:25.854 --> 16:29.162
- Dad. Okay, this is why I
haven't told you for so long.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.077
I have doctors.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.601
Just help me by being my dad.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.695
- Let me get Yoshida
on the phone.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.049
[sighing]

16:48.746 --> 16:51.271
- Did you discharge
the guy in three? The new dad?

16:51.314 --> 16:54.056
- No, actually, I was going
to explain his imaging results.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.406
- I found this in his room.
I called OB,

16:56.450 --> 16:58.495
and he's not there either.
- We lost him?

16:58.539 --> 17:00.323
Are you guys doing okay
in there?

17:00.367 --> 17:01.716
- We didn't lose him,
he left.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.284
And yes, we're having
a small staffing issue,

17:04.327 --> 17:06.155
but we're managing
just fine.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.722
- I got it!

17:07.765 --> 17:09.506
Peter's not here yet, sir.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.508
Let's wait in your room,
okay?

17:11.943 --> 17:14.032
[Ray]: Did you start her on
the antibiotics?

17:14.076 --> 17:15.817
Let me call you back.

17:15.859 --> 17:18.646
- Broad spectrum, until
we figure out the cause
of her fever.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.604
- Well, that was
the neurologist I like.

17:20.647 --> 17:23.651
He advises we run a few exams
to rule out ALS.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.479
Spinal tap and EMG.

17:25.521 --> 17:28.002
- Kelsey was pretty firm
on not wanting to re-test.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.658
- She's febrile with a headache
and soar neck.

17:30.701 --> 17:33.008
An LP will rule out
meningitis, would it not?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.228
- Yes, and while meningitis
is plausible,

17:35.271 --> 17:38.753
there are less invasive ways
of narrowing down a fever.

17:38.796 --> 17:41.060
- My daughter runs on emotion,
Dr. Hamed.

17:41.364 --> 17:44.324
She'll make the right choice
if we lead her to it.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.021
Your boss said
to do everything we can.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.110
If you want to sign-off,
he's right over there,

17:48.154 --> 17:50.634
talking to the co-head
of emerg at UHN of all people.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.724
[indistinct chatter]

17:55.291 --> 17:58.294
- I've got three minutes before
a consult if you need me.

17:58.338 --> 18:02.255
- Uh, yeah. Actually, I just
caught this patient in emerg.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.779
She's 12 weeks post-op
from a gastric bypass,

18:04.822 --> 18:07.477
has nausea and vomiting.
But her imaging's clear.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.913
- She's aware
of dumping syndrome?

18:08.957 --> 18:10.959
- She is, but it could be
something else right,

18:11.002 --> 18:13.701
like a peptic ulcer,
an obstruction or Crohn's or--

18:13.744 --> 18:15.529
- What are you asking me
to approve, June?

18:15.572 --> 18:17.531
- A C-scope and a G-scope.

18:17.574 --> 18:20.534
- Okay, but you could have
ordered those anyway.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.362
- Right,
but not everybody would,

18:22.405 --> 18:23.972
based on her symptoms so...

18:25.495 --> 18:27.628
Okay, you're the one who's
always telling me to watch out

18:27.671 --> 18:29.151
for landmines.

18:29.847 --> 18:33.068
- Statistically, you know
it's unlikely this is anything

18:33.112 --> 18:35.288
other than side effects
from her bypass.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.638
- What I know is that I've made
the mistake in the past

18:37.681 --> 18:40.293
of listening to statistics
over patients.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.861
- Keep me in the loop.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.951
- Keep you in the loop.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.170
[knocking]

18:48.214 --> 18:51.042
- We're monitoring
Kelsey Grisholm closely.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.523
Her father's a handful,
but we're on top of it.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.004
- Let me know
if you need any input.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.268
Hey, I meant to ask,
how's your sister?

18:59.790 --> 19:01.270
Since her head laceration.

19:01.314 --> 19:04.708
- Oh, uh...
she's healing fine.

19:04.752 --> 19:07.581
I doubt it'll scar.

19:07.624 --> 19:08.756
- Good.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.934
The woman she came in with,
I'm told that's your fiancÃ©?

19:12.977 --> 19:15.110
- She was. Uh...

19:15.154 --> 19:18.157
Now, she's the reason
Amira won't talk to me.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.420
- Sorry to hear that.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.944
- Amira,
she takes everything on

19:22.987 --> 19:25.816
and I think
she learned that from me.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.168
- You're not alone, Bashir.

19:31.257 --> 19:37.393
Sir, that doctor that you were
speaking with earlier,

19:37.437 --> 19:39.656
are you hiring a co-chief?

19:41.528 --> 19:43.660
[sighs]

19:44.400 --> 19:45.923
- No.

19:46.924 --> 19:49.231
I've been asked to meet
candidates

19:49.275 --> 19:52.016
and lead the transition
to a new chief.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.803
- You're being pushed out?

19:56.717 --> 19:59.198
- Well, let's just keep this
between us for now.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.287
It's not something I wanted,
and to be frank,

20:01.330 --> 20:02.505
I don't know where it goes.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.159
- There must be something
that we can do.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.205
- Let me handle, okay.
I'll find a way to get

20:06.248 --> 20:07.989
the board on side again.

20:11.862 --> 20:14.604
I know you think you're only
here because of me,

20:14.648 --> 20:16.345
but you're not.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.173
You're here because of you.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.870
Do you understand?

20:23.961 --> 20:25.702
- Can we put her oxygen
up to eight litres

20:25.746 --> 20:27.835
and find out
where her chest X-ray is?

20:27.878 --> 20:31.055
Any nausea?
Cold extremities at all?

20:31.969 --> 20:33.971
- Just a bit short of breath.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.844
I assumed it was a touch
of the flu.

20:36.887 --> 20:39.803
- Which could be more dangerous
for ALS patients.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.457
- You sound like my dad.

20:43.590 --> 20:45.200
He's not a bad guy.

20:45.244 --> 20:49.073
I know how badly he wants
to fix me.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.424
Fix this.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.687
But when it comes
to relating to me?

20:53.730 --> 20:55.776
That's all he's ever known.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.169
- And what about you?

20:58.213 --> 20:59.910
What do you want?

21:01.085 --> 21:03.479
- To somehow meet this
on my own terms?

21:05.699 --> 21:07.657
Buying that bar
was a dream come true

21:07.701 --> 21:11.270
and I want to run it
for as long as I can.

21:13.228 --> 21:14.273
[knocking]

21:15.752 --> 21:17.363
- Her temp's up again.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.758
- Um...

21:21.802 --> 21:23.891
I was wondering if you would
consider letting us

21:23.934 --> 21:25.545
do a lumbar puncture?

21:25.588 --> 21:28.417
It would help us
rule out meningitis,
source your fever and...

21:28.461 --> 21:31.028
- Re-confirm my ALS diagnosis?

21:31.638 --> 21:33.857
My father ask you
to float that?

21:34.249 --> 21:35.729
- Yes, he did.

21:35.772 --> 21:38.122
- Resistance is futile
with Ray.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.212
Is that true about my fever?

21:41.996 --> 21:43.389
- Wait, you're in control here.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.913
Nothing's gonna happen
without your consent.

21:45.956 --> 21:48.916
Okay?
- Okay.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.355
[gentle music]

22:01.711 --> 22:03.800
- The maternity ward's
the other way.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.064
- I can't go up there.

22:07.108 --> 22:09.284
- So you--
Uh, you're just...

22:09.328 --> 22:10.894
You're leaving?

22:10.938 --> 22:12.896
- But then, I remembered
I totalled our car.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.769
I just finished paying it off
last month too,

22:15.812 --> 22:17.510
after nine years.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.250
I don't even have a job
right now.

22:19.294 --> 22:21.035
- Ben, why don't you
come with me?

22:21.078 --> 22:23.385
- I didn't want a baby,
Dr. Hunter.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.734
It kinda just happened.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.823
I thought if I cut
my losses now,

22:26.867 --> 22:29.130
I'd be doing that kid
a favour.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.091
I can see you judging me.

22:34.135 --> 22:37.268
- Look I would never say
running out on a new-born baby

22:37.312 --> 22:40.359
is a good idea,
but that's not why I'm here.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.709
You spleen is ruptured.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.275
You need surgery.

22:44.319 --> 22:45.451
- What?

22:46.408 --> 22:49.280
So I guess...
- Yeah.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.543
- Oh, okay.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.850
[indistinct chatter on PA]

22:57.941 --> 22:59.856
- Imaging's up.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.993
- Guys, what's happening?

23:06.559 --> 23:07.995
Just tell me, I can take it.

23:08.038 --> 23:09.910
- I'm hearing crackles
in your lungs.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.477
- Crackles? From what?

23:11.520 --> 23:14.480
- Based on your chest X-rays,
it's likely pneumonia.

23:14.523 --> 23:15.655
- Wouldn't I be coughing?

23:15.698 --> 23:17.221
- ALS makes it hard to cough

23:17.265 --> 23:19.180
due to the degeneration
of the airway.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.747
- Then you accept my diagnosis?

23:20.790 --> 23:22.966
- Until we get the results back
from the lumbar puncture,

23:23.010 --> 23:24.185
we have to assume--
- She's not...

23:24.228 --> 23:26.883
doing a lumbar puncture,
Dr. Grisholm.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.409
- Stop trying to work him, Dad.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.411
I've done the tests.

23:32.933 --> 23:36.110
I've come to terms--
- Let me talk next steps.

23:36.676 --> 23:39.113
- Well, we'll continue
O2 therapy,

23:39.156 --> 23:41.681
target the pneumonia
with macrolide antibiotics

23:41.724 --> 23:43.117
and monitor her levels
carefully.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.033
- Also, we should consider
mechanical ventilation.

23:46.076 --> 23:48.427
- What does that mean?
Is that intubation?

23:48.470 --> 23:51.299
- Yes. You're not coughing
due to the ALS,

23:51.342 --> 23:53.867
which means that without help
your body might not be able

23:53.910 --> 23:55.738
to clear the secretions
caused by pneumonia.

23:55.782 --> 23:57.523
- Dr. Hamed's right.
It's aggressive,

23:57.566 --> 23:59.394
but it's the best way
to prevent hypoxia.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.701
- Yes, but it's not your only
option here, Kelsey.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.225
We can try BIPAP for
supplemental O2.

24:04.268 --> 24:06.532
There's also postural drainage
and percussion--

24:06.575 --> 24:08.664
- Which might not be enough
to keep dangerous amounts

24:08.708 --> 24:09.926
of fluids from building.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.754
- But there's a chance
I could still

24:11.798 --> 24:13.234
recover on my own, right?

24:13.277 --> 24:15.584
- Yes.
This is your choice.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.239
- And intubation
is the right one.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.023
[sighing]

24:26.465 --> 24:28.292
- I've done my homework.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.513
If I'm intubated,

24:31.557 --> 24:33.254
I may never come off
the ventilator, right?

24:33.297 --> 24:35.212
That's what happens
with ALS, right?

24:35.256 --> 24:36.997
- No, this is an end-stage, Kel.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.216
It'll only help you breathe
until you fight off
the pneumonia,

24:39.260 --> 24:41.349
then they extubate you
in a day or two.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.442
- No.
- Come on, Kel.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.400
- I said no.
I don't want to be intubated.

24:49.444 --> 24:52.447
- Dammit, Kelsey! You need
a plan to deal with this!

24:52.491 --> 24:54.101
This is what I do!
Why can't you trust me?

24:54.144 --> 24:55.581
- Because you're not
hearing me!

24:55.624 --> 24:57.104
[sobbing]

24:57.147 --> 24:59.498
Just stop and listen
for once!

25:00.499 --> 25:02.501
[laboured breathing]

25:02.544 --> 25:05.460
You are doing exactly
what you did with Mom.

25:06.156 --> 25:08.811
And not just when she was sick,
her whole life.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.640
Your voice is always
the loudest.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.121
If I'm intubated,

25:14.164 --> 25:15.992
then you get to call
all the shots.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.907
You get to make
all my choices

25:17.951 --> 25:19.909
and I can't give that kind
of power to someone

25:19.953 --> 25:22.259
who's never listened to me.

25:22.999 --> 25:25.262
[sobbing]

25:34.707 --> 25:37.187
[soft music]

25:38.275 --> 25:39.538
[sighing]

25:42.541 --> 25:44.673
[indistinct chatter on PA]

25:44.717 --> 25:46.762
- Oh, apparently, he wandered
into an exam room

25:46.806 --> 25:48.634
while a patient
was getting changed?

25:48.677 --> 25:50.505
- Not intentionally.
He's just confused about--

25:50.549 --> 25:53.203
- We should've located
his people by now. What's
the hold up, Arnold?

25:53.247 --> 25:54.553
- We're trying.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.991
- The reason I put both of you
on Kelsey Grisholm

25:58.034 --> 26:01.298
was to make sure things
went smoothly.

26:02.212 --> 26:04.650
- Well, I know it took a while
to catch the pneumonia,

26:04.693 --> 26:06.608
but that's because she didn't
show the regular signs--

26:06.652 --> 26:08.001
- No, I understand
the diagnosis.

26:08.044 --> 26:10.699
What I don't understand
is why people I report to

26:10.743 --> 26:13.354
are telling me that my resident
is standing in the way

26:13.397 --> 26:15.574
of a patient getting the care
she needs.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.794
Ray has friends
in high places.

26:18.838 --> 26:20.535
- No, that's not at all
how it happened.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.624
He was steamrolling
his daughter into intubating--

26:22.668 --> 26:24.713
- I recommended mechanical
ventilation

26:24.757 --> 26:26.628
because I think Kelsey
should consider it.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.239
Dr. Grisholm agreed
and made a strong case for it.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.894
- By ignoring hers.
- We are never going to intubate

26:31.938 --> 26:34.114
a patient against their will,
Mags, you know that,

26:34.157 --> 26:36.856
but there's no law against
giving an opinion

26:36.899 --> 26:39.510
and Ray feels that you weren't
legitimately considering

26:39.554 --> 26:41.034
all the options.

26:42.426 --> 26:43.645
- Fine.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.865
Fine, I'll tread more
carefully.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.433
- Can you handle this
on your own?

26:49.782 --> 26:52.132
- What?
You're taking me off?

26:52.175 --> 26:54.656
- I'm ensuring there are
no more calls from upstairs.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.789
- Doctor Bishop, that is not--
- Mags!

26:57.180 --> 26:58.878
Don't push it.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.620
- Since when does Bishop
let politics

27:01.663 --> 27:03.360
get in the way of a patient?

27:03.404 --> 27:05.101
- That's not what he's doing.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.888
[steady beeping]

27:10.890 --> 27:14.067
[gentle music]

27:23.250 --> 27:24.686
- Dr. Roche.
- Dr. Curtis.

27:24.730 --> 27:27.254
Why is one of my post-op
patients in the endoscopy suite?

27:27.863 --> 27:31.214
- Maya Crawford presented
in emerg with significant
discomfort,

27:31.258 --> 27:33.390
thought it warranted
investigation, so I--

27:33.434 --> 27:34.870
- Decided to waste time
and resources?

27:34.914 --> 27:36.698
Ms. Crawford was here
two weeks ago.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.700
Her issue was diet.
She's my patient

27:38.744 --> 27:41.311
and I'm telling you
this procedure isn't necessary.

27:41.355 --> 27:44.358
- With respect, Dr. Roche,
Maya's following her diet.

27:44.401 --> 27:46.795
- With respect,
they all say that.

27:47.143 --> 27:49.015
And when you've been doing this
as long as I have,

27:49.058 --> 27:50.930
you learn to see
the patterns, right?

27:53.759 --> 27:55.586
- She's not a pattern,
she's a person.

27:55.630 --> 27:58.633
Doesn't she warrant
the same investigation
as any other patient?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.156
- Put her back
on a liquid diet.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.245
If there's no change,
I'll be happy to see her again

28:02.289 --> 28:04.726
in four to six weeks.
- She doesn't want to see you.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.206
- You're out of line, June.

28:06.249 --> 28:09.383
- It's fine, Aajay.
Let's see what she turns up.

28:13.430 --> 28:15.302
[gentle music]

28:28.315 --> 28:30.056
- Awn, she looks peaceful.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.622
- Now, she does.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.886
We just fought over my boob
for an hour.

28:33.929 --> 28:37.106
She refuses to latch, even
though I know she's starving.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.543
- You want them to be fighters.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.110
- Well, you've met her parents.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.547
Speaking of, there was
an ER nurse that came looking

28:43.591 --> 28:45.636
for Ben earlier.
Have you seen him?

28:45.680 --> 28:47.638
- He's in surgery.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.728
- What?
- He had a ruptured spleen,

28:49.771 --> 28:51.381
but he's gonna be fine.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.122
[scoffs]
- Why didn't he tell me?

28:53.166 --> 28:55.995
Or respond to my texts?

28:56.865 --> 28:58.171
I know we're that couple.

28:58.214 --> 29:00.782
You know, that breaks up
a thousand times and...

29:00.826 --> 29:03.480
gets married to try
to save the relationship,

29:03.524 --> 29:05.787
and then when that
doesn't work...

29:09.660 --> 29:12.925
The nurse that was looking for
him didn't know where he was.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.319
He was gonna leave,
wasn't he?

29:17.103 --> 29:18.539
- I'm sorry.

29:18.582 --> 29:19.845
[sighs]

29:20.454 --> 29:23.326
That's probably because...

29:23.979 --> 29:27.330
I didn't exactly let Ben in
on my decision

29:27.374 --> 29:28.810
to forget taking the pill.

29:28.854 --> 29:32.640
But I'm 36
and I wanted a baby.

29:32.683 --> 29:34.816
- So you planned
to get pregnant?

29:34.860 --> 29:36.818
- I know, I'm the worst.

29:37.906 --> 29:40.430
Money's tight,
things have been hard.

29:40.474 --> 29:41.954
I know I should probably
end things,

29:41.997 --> 29:43.825
but every time I think about
doing this on my own,

29:43.869 --> 29:45.784
I just chicken out.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.483
[baby fusses]

29:49.526 --> 29:51.441
Time for round two.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.226
- Let me help.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.187
Oh, yes.

30:02.757 --> 30:03.802
- Arnold.

30:03.845 --> 30:05.107
- Her BP dropped
so I came to check.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.587
She'd vomited
bright red blood.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.371
- Hematemesis.
I'll ultrasound!

30:08.415 --> 30:09.851
- A bleed from pneumonia?

30:09.895 --> 30:12.549
- What's happening?
- Possible esophageal bleed.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.334
- From what?
- Blunt force trauma

30:14.377 --> 30:17.337
can cause portal vein
thrombosis. Could she have
genetic varices?

30:17.380 --> 30:18.947
- It's possible.

30:19.730 --> 30:20.993
- Talk to me!

30:21.036 --> 30:22.864
- She's going
into hemorrhagic shock.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.867
We need to stop the bleed.
- Rhythm's erratic.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.522
- Give her her own fluids
and activate MTP.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.525
Unstable V-tach,
we need to cardiovert!

30:31.568 --> 30:33.527
- Stay with me, kid.
Stay with me.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.921
[machine beeping rapidly]

30:37.270 --> 30:39.098
[dramatic music]

30:45.844 --> 30:47.671
- Charging up to 100 J.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.064
Clear!

30:50.631 --> 30:52.067
- Charge it to 200,
try again.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.330
Her rhythm's going nowhere.
- Charging.

30:54.374 --> 30:56.202
Clear!

30:56.724 --> 30:58.987
- We're losing her!
We have to do something!

30:59.031 --> 31:00.423
- I could do a Blakemore.
- It's risky,

31:00.467 --> 31:02.643
considering the ALS.
Could damage her airway.

31:02.686 --> 31:03.992
- We don't even train
for that anymore!

31:04.036 --> 31:05.864
- No, I know how and we need
to stop the bleed.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.474
- You do it.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.302
- It has to be Dr. Hamed.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.392
- Please.
Save my little girl.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.917
- Give us room to work,
Dr. Grisholm.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.876
- I'll prep the Blakemore kit.
I'll need a laryngoscope

31:17.919 --> 31:19.094
and portable X-ray
to confirm placement!

31:19.138 --> 31:20.922
And have 50 mics
of octreotide

31:20.966 --> 31:22.358
and a gram of ceftriaxone
ready.

31:22.402 --> 31:23.882
- On it!

31:26.362 --> 31:28.495
[somber music]

31:33.717 --> 31:35.371
[hubbub]

31:40.115 --> 31:41.377
- Mags.
- What?

31:41.421 --> 31:43.902
- You almost done?
- There's other terminals.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.170
- What's up?

31:51.213 --> 31:53.563
- I think I hate everybody
we work with.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.826
Except you, obviously.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.091
- Well, give it time.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.962
If there's one thing
that I've learned,

32:01.006 --> 32:03.747
it's that everyone
disappoints you eventually.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.461
- Dr. Grisholm?

32:22.027 --> 32:25.073
The surgeons will update us
as soon as they know more,

32:25.117 --> 32:28.033
but we stopped the bleed long
enough to get Kelsey to the OR.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.643
- Thank you.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.124
Thank you, Dr. Hamed.

32:32.820 --> 32:36.563
My daughter didn't even
want to tell me she had this
horrible disease.

32:37.868 --> 32:41.002
She needs to know
I'm listening now.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.706
- Why would Mel play
my voice mail for her lawyer?

32:49.750 --> 32:51.621
[lawyer]: So he could play it
for yours,

32:51.665 --> 32:54.015
before we all have to hear it
in front of a judge.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.626
All you're doing is making
this worse, Theo.

32:56.670 --> 32:59.020
- It's her lawyers
that are making this worse!

32:59.064 --> 33:01.980
They're acting like nothing good
ever happened between us!

33:02.023 --> 33:05.548
Suddenly, I'm this villain
who isn't worthy

33:05.592 --> 33:07.159
of parenting his own kids!

33:07.202 --> 33:08.812
- Theo.

33:08.856 --> 33:11.641
You chose to take a job in a
different city from your family.

33:11.685 --> 33:13.295
You can't erase that.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.123
Of course, she was going
to ask for custody.

33:15.167 --> 33:18.170
And as your lawyer, I'm telling
you that if you don't stop

33:18.213 --> 33:20.999
being so stubborn then
you could lose everything.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.176
- Dr. Curtis!

33:24.219 --> 33:26.395
Maya's having some kind
of episode!

33:27.266 --> 33:29.877
[intense music]

33:30.878 --> 33:32.401
- She said
her heart's racing,

33:32.445 --> 33:34.664
she's shaking like a leaf,
so I'm putting her on a monitor.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.710
- Can you do a bedside glucose?

33:38.233 --> 33:40.061
- What's wrong with her?

33:40.105 --> 33:41.367
[machine beeping]

33:41.410 --> 33:42.803
- She's tachycardic.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.935
- Maya, if you can hear me,
can you say something?

33:44.979 --> 33:46.720
- Something.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.419
- So there is a problem?

33:50.898 --> 33:52.943
The testing.
What did you find?

33:54.249 --> 33:57.209
- Nothing.
- Yeah. There's no blockage.

33:57.252 --> 33:59.037
No polyps. No ulcer.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.386
- Glucose is 3,4.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.562
- Alright, she gonna need
one amp of D-50,

34:02.605 --> 34:04.564
then could you just
give us a second?

34:04.607 --> 34:06.609
- What does that mean?
The glucose?

34:06.653 --> 34:09.960
- Well, rapid emptying can cause
acute episodes of hypoglycemia.

34:10.004 --> 34:11.745
It's hard to keep your sugars
stable when your body

34:11.788 --> 34:13.268
rejects everything
you put in it.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.357
- So, we're back
where we started,

34:15.400 --> 34:16.663
with you telling me
to eat less.

34:16.706 --> 34:18.404
- No, Maya.
It's not what I'm saying.

34:18.447 --> 34:20.058
You haven't done
anything wrong.

34:20.101 --> 34:21.797
- Then why is this happening?

34:22.712 --> 34:25.585
- I don't know if Dr. Roche
made this clear,

34:25.628 --> 34:28.283
but gastric bypass
is a complex surgery

34:28.327 --> 34:30.024
that can have various
outcomes.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.678
- And mine varied into hell.

34:31.721 --> 34:34.289
- You had an extreme reaction
and it's gonna take some time

34:34.333 --> 34:36.900
for your stomach to recover
so you can intake normally.

34:38.206 --> 34:41.295
- I didn't even want the damn
surgery in the first place.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.907
If I'd know it would be
this bad...

34:44.429 --> 34:46.214
- There's nothing else
you can do?

34:46.649 --> 34:48.389
- Well, there are some
medications we can try.

34:48.434 --> 34:51.828
They slow the emptying from
the stomach into the intestine.

34:51.871 --> 34:54.527
And I can find
a nutritionist who's committed

34:54.570 --> 34:56.442
to something called
Health at Any Size,

34:56.485 --> 34:58.444
and they help you manage
meals and side effects.

34:58.487 --> 35:01.577
- What if I never adjust?
I just live like this?

35:02.143 --> 35:04.450
- You come back here when things
get bad again

35:04.493 --> 35:06.582
and bypass reversal
is an option.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.932
- Reversal.
You mean more surgery.

35:08.976 --> 35:11.674
- If you're serious about
wanting another choice,
then yeah.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.112
- Could that make things worse?

35:14.982 --> 35:17.898
- It's an open surgery,
so it can have complications,

35:17.941 --> 35:19.726
I would talk it over carefully
with your surgeon.

35:19.769 --> 35:24.034
But I can refer you to someone
who is not Dr. Roche.

35:24.992 --> 35:27.995
Think about it, Maya.
I'm here if you need me.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.654
- The surgeons have managed
to repair your spleen.

35:34.697 --> 35:37.004
A couple more days
and you'll be up and around.

35:38.223 --> 35:41.095
Ben, I didn't mean
to judge you before...

35:41.139 --> 35:43.402
- I thought we could call
her Crash?

35:43.445 --> 35:46.492
Dr. Hunter, do you mind bringing
her over to her daddy?

35:46.535 --> 35:48.058
- Of course.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.759
[gentle music]

36:03.030 --> 36:04.553
- Hello, there.

36:06.555 --> 36:08.166
Oh my God, hi.

36:09.558 --> 36:11.256
Welcome to the world.

36:15.695 --> 36:17.175
- She has your eyes.

36:19.002 --> 36:20.482
- I love you, Tess.

36:20.526 --> 36:21.875
- I love you too.

36:22.354 --> 36:24.747
We can make it work,
I know it.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.278
- Here. Uh...

36:34.192 --> 36:36.237
It's a beat-up 2013 Sedan,

36:36.281 --> 36:38.544
but she's got some good miles
left in her

36:38.587 --> 36:40.763
and there's an old car seat
in the trunk.

36:40.807 --> 36:42.417
- You're giving us your car?

36:42.461 --> 36:44.854
Dr. Hunter, I mean,
thanks, but--

36:44.898 --> 36:46.334
- You're gonna need one.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.901
- That is so generous,
but we can't accept.

36:47.944 --> 36:49.685
- You have to. I...

36:49.729 --> 36:51.992
I need to purge a few things.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.951
And I'll start jogging
to work,

36:54.995 --> 36:57.040
so I mean, really,
you're doing me a favour.

36:57.084 --> 36:59.478
- We don't know what to say.

37:00.392 --> 37:02.655
- Just say you'll give
that kid a great life.

37:05.571 --> 37:08.574
[soft music]

37:29.725 --> 37:32.250
- They stopped the bleed, but...

37:32.293 --> 37:34.991
apparently, the Blakemore tube
damaged the airway.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.776
They had to do a tracheotomy.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.518
- I was careful
with the inflation.

37:39.561 --> 37:40.606
- I know.

37:40.649 --> 37:41.911
And the surgeons agree,

37:41.955 --> 37:43.609
if you hadn't acted,
she would have died.

37:43.652 --> 37:47.700
But her body's weak and
couldn't take the pressure.

37:49.092 --> 37:51.660
Kelsey will live,
but she'll be attached
to a ventilator

37:51.704 --> 37:53.967
for the rest of her life
and unable to speak.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.795
- Oh, my God...

37:57.405 --> 37:59.886
- This is exactly what
she didn't want to happen.

37:59.929 --> 38:01.801
- I'm sorry, Bash.

38:09.765 --> 38:11.550
- We made the call together.

38:12.115 --> 38:15.293
A lot of doctors
would've been paralyzed,
you stopped the bleed.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.643
- And then, ruined
this woman's life.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.430
- It could've easily rolled
the other way.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.350
- But it didn't.

38:34.050 --> 38:36.531
[dramatic music]

38:42.885 --> 38:44.844
[hubbub]

38:47.499 --> 38:49.152
- You wanted to see me?

38:49.631 --> 38:51.633
- You're called
into a meeting.

38:52.068 --> 38:55.028
Roche isn't happy
about your little dispute
over Maya Crawford

38:55.071 --> 38:57.160
and she's making it known
to the division heads.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.555
- I came to you for advice.

39:01.077 --> 39:02.601
You just let me
walk right into that.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.517
- I didn't tell you to go
toe-to-toe with the head of GI.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.909
- But you stood there
and watched it happen.

39:06.953 --> 39:08.650
I just--
I thought you had my back.

39:10.304 --> 39:13.263
- You made an enemy
of the wrong person today.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.354
Maybe stop at one.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.276
[beeping]

39:32.282 --> 39:34.067
- This is my last coin.

39:35.285 --> 39:36.765
- Sir, we need to talk.

39:37.897 --> 39:40.247
- You're never wrong to fight
for your patients, Mags.

39:40.682 --> 39:41.814
- Thank you.

39:42.423 --> 39:45.687
Although, I'm not sure that
actually counts as an apology.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.823
- Ray was out of line,
as was I.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.695
Why do I get the impression
you're here to register

39:53.739 --> 39:55.088
another complaint?

39:55.131 --> 39:56.698
- Cardiology.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.831
I told you I wanted
to explore it.

39:58.874 --> 40:00.267
But you didn't hear me.

40:00.310 --> 40:01.573
- You also told me emerg

40:01.616 --> 40:02.922
was the only thing
you ever wanted.

40:02.965 --> 40:05.228
What's changed?
- I don't know.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.492
I don't know.

40:07.535 --> 40:10.582
I just know that I can't
get it out of my head

40:10.625 --> 40:13.454
and you need to let me
explore my future.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.238
Even if I mess it up.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.286
- Okay, well,
I'm hearing you now.

40:20.461 --> 40:23.508
I don't like the idea of sharing
you with another department,

40:23.551 --> 40:25.379
but if it's what you want...

40:27.555 --> 40:29.470
I'll talk to Dr. Fisher.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.863
- Appreciate that.

40:30.906 --> 40:33.343
You should really watch
your sugar intake.

40:36.912 --> 40:41.743
- His eyes are green, actually
they're sometimes blue.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.832
And he's funny.

40:43.876 --> 40:46.879
- I'm sorry. Sir--
- No, this is important.

40:46.922 --> 40:49.925
He gets very frightened
when he's on his own.

40:49.969 --> 40:52.537
- Gilbert?
- Claire!

40:52.580 --> 40:54.930
Where've you been all day?

40:56.149 --> 40:58.760
When did I get
to the hospital?

40:58.804 --> 41:00.327
- This morning, sir.

41:00.893 --> 41:02.721
- Ah, right.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.940
I'm looking for Peter.

41:04.984 --> 41:06.812
We've lost him again.

41:06.855 --> 41:09.597
- Your cat lives with your son
in Belleville.

41:09.641 --> 41:12.426
Andre takes very good
care of him.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.428
- Peter's a cat?
- Mm-hmm.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.125
- You never mentioned that.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.519
- You never asked.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.001
- I think I have your
son's number in my phone,

41:22.044 --> 41:24.003
should I give him a ring?
- Never leave again.

41:24.046 --> 41:26.919
Also, Bishop needs to see you
in his office.

41:27.310 --> 41:29.704
How about you tell me more
about your cat?

41:29.748 --> 41:31.227
- Okay.

41:31.271 --> 41:32.968
[knocking]

41:37.669 --> 41:39.148
[chuckles]

41:39.192 --> 41:41.368
- Oh wow!

41:48.375 --> 41:49.942
- Ta-da!
- What?

41:49.985 --> 41:51.334
- Congratulations, Claire.

41:56.252 --> 41:58.167
[laughing]

42:00.169 --> 42:02.302
- You're going to feel
really bad if I failed.

42:02.345 --> 42:04.478
[laughing]

42:04.522 --> 42:06.480
Oh, thank you.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.590
- I had a chance to fix things.

42:31.810 --> 42:34.203
To get to know her the way
I should have.

42:34.726 --> 42:38.338
Now, I never will.

42:40.079 --> 42:42.603
- I'm very sorry
that it went this way.

42:45.127 --> 42:47.913
- After what you took
from us...

42:48.827 --> 42:51.438
...sorry won't be good enough,
Dr. Hamed.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.572
This is your fault.

42:59.664 --> 43:02.884
Subtitling: difuze
