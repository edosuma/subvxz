needed him most, he vanished.</i>

<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

<i>he has a lot to learn before

00:37.710 --> 00:38.920
AANG: Oof!

00:39.040 --> 00:42.000
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:02.360 --> 01:04.610
More ferocious!

01:04.730 --> 01:06.360
Imagine striking through
your opponent's heart.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.740
( GROANS ) I'm trying.

like a tiger-dillo!

01:12.620 --> 01:14.370
( ROARS WEAKLY )

01:14.660 --> 01:16.410
That sounded pathetic.

01:16.790 --> 01:18.120

( ROARING )

01:22.420 --> 01:24.670

01:29.420 --> 01:31.050

01:31.180 --> 01:34.680
Hey, your lesson's not over yet!
Get back here!

01:34.810 --> 01:36.810
Come on, Zuko, just take a break.

01:36.890 --> 01:38.100
What's the big deal?

01:38.520 --> 01:40.060
Fine.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.440
If you wanna lounge around

01:42.560 --> 01:44.650

01:44.770 --> 01:46.980
- AANG: ( SLURPING )
- Maybe Zuko's right.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.190
Sitting around the house
has made us pretty lazy.

02:18.970 --> 02:21.100

02:21.230 --> 02:22.520
You're gonna love this.

02:40.410 --> 02:43.670
AANG: Is that a blubbering blob-monster?

02:43.790 --> 02:45.290
No, it's Suki!

02:45.630 --> 02:48.750

02:49.090 --> 02:50.420

I think it's sweet.

03:31.090 --> 03:32.590
What happened?

03:32.710 --> 03:34.300
Zuko's gone crazy!

03:34.380 --> 03:36.890
I made a sand sculpture
of Suki and he destroyed it!

03:38.640 --> 03:40.510
Oh, and he's attacking Aang.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.700
Get a grip before I blast
you off this roof!

04:02.120 --> 04:03.660
Go ahead and do it.

You could have hurt Aang.

04:49.710 --> 04:50.880

04:51.170 --> 04:52.920
What's wrong with all of you?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.590
How can you sit around
having beach parties

04:54.670 --> 04:57.090
when Sozin's comet
is only three days away?

04:59.630 --> 05:01.760
Why are you all looking
at me like I'm crazy?

05:01.890 --> 05:03.810
About Sozin's comet―

05:03.930 --> 05:05.850
I was actually gonna
wait to fight the Fire Lord

05:05.970 --> 05:07.390
until after it came.

05:07.480 --> 05:08.560
After?

05:08.690 --> 05:09.850
I'm not ready.

05:09.980 --> 05:12.190
I need more time to master firebending.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.270
And, frankly, your earthbending

05:14.400 --> 05:15.570
could still use some work, too.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.360
So, you all knew Aang was gonna wait?

05:18.820 --> 05:21.570
Honestly, if Aang tries to
fight the Fire Lord right now,

05:21.700 --> 05:22.990
he's gonna lose.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.240
No offense.

05:24.370 --> 05:27.200
The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord
before the comet

05:27.330 --> 05:29.290
was to stop the Fire Nation
from winning the war.

05:29.410 --> 05:32.170
But they pretty much won the war
when they took Ba Sing Se.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.540
Things can't get any worse.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.090
You're wrong.

05:37.210 --> 05:39.720
It's about to get worse
than you can even imagine.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.010
<i>The day before the eclipse,</i>

05:42.090 --> 05:44.800
<i>my father asked me to attend
an important war meeting.</i>

05:44.930 --> 05:47.970
<i>It was what I'd dreamed about
and wanted for so many years.</i>

05:48.100 --> 05:49.850
<i>My father had finally accepted me back.</i>

05:53.770 --> 05:55.770
OZAI: Welcome, Prince Zuko.

05:55.900 --> 05:57.570
We waited for you.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.490
General Shinu, your report.

06:07.830 --> 06:09.660
Thank you, sir.

06:09.750 --> 06:12.790
Ba Sing Se is still under our control,

06:12.920 --> 06:15.710
however, earthbender
rebellions have prevented us

06:15.840 --> 06:18.840
from achieving total victory
in the Earth Kingdom.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.670
What is your recommendation?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.760
Our army is spread too thin,

06:22.880 --> 06:25.850
but once the eclipse is over,
and the invasion defeated,

06:25.970 --> 06:29.680
we should transfer more domestic
forces into the Earth Kingdom.

06:29.810 --> 06:31.270
Mmm...

06:31.350 --> 06:34.560
Prince Zuko, you've been among
the Earth Kingdom commoners.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.860
Do you think that adding more troops

06:36.940 --> 06:38.360
will stop these rebellions?

06:40.610 --> 06:43.820
The people of the Earth Kingdom
are proud and strong.

06:43.950 --> 06:47.780
They can endure anything
as long as they have hope.

06:47.910 --> 06:49.370
Yes, you're right.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.790
We need to destroy their hope.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.210
Well, that's not exactly what I―

06:56.330 --> 06:58.460
I think you should take
their precious hope,

06:58.590 --> 07:02.670
and the rest of their land
and burn it all to the ground.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.680
Yes, yes, you're right Azula.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.510
Sozin's comet is almost upon us,

07:09.600 --> 07:11.600
and on that day, it will endow us

07:11.730 --> 07:14.480
with the strength
and power of a hundred suns.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.230
No bender will stand a chance against us.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.690
What are you suggesting, sir?

07:20.030 --> 07:24.360
When the comet last came,
my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin,

07:24.450 --> 07:26.570
used it to wipe out the Air Nomads.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.450
Now, I will use its power
to end the Earth Kingdom...

07:30.910 --> 07:32.370
Permanently!

07:33.750 --> 07:37.420
From our airships we will
rain fire over their lands,

07:37.540 --> 07:40.960
a fire that will destroy everything,

07:41.090 --> 07:44.630
and out of the ashes,
a new world will be born.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.640
A world in which all
the lands are Fire Nation,

07:47.720 --> 07:52.100
and I am the supreme ruler of everything!

07:52.310 --> 07:53.600
ALL: ( APPLAUDING )

07:53.680 --> 07:56.730
ZUKO: <i>I wanted to speak out</i>
<i>against this horrifying plan,</i>

07:56.810 --> 07:58.650
<i>but I'm ashamed to say I didn't.</i>

07:59.560 --> 08:00.690
My whole life, I've struggled

08:00.820 --> 08:03.230
to gain my father's love and acceptance.

08:03.360 --> 08:04.780
But once I had it,

08:04.900 --> 08:07.740
I realized I'd lost myself getting there.

08:07.860 --> 08:10.410
I'd forgotten who I was.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.910
I can't believe this.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.410
I always knew the Fire Lord was a bad guy.

08:15.540 --> 08:18.750
But his plan is just pure evil.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.880
What am I gonna do?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.750
I know you're scared.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.220
And I know you're not
ready to save the world.

08:25.510 --> 08:28.590
But if you don't defeat the
Fire Lord before the comet comes,

08:28.680 --> 08:30.800
there won't be a world to save anymore.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.730
Why didn't you tell me about
your dad's crazy plan sooner?

08:40.860 --> 08:42.400
I didn't think I had to.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.610
I assumed you were still gonna
fight him before the comet.

08:44.730 --> 08:47.200
No one told me you decided to wait.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.660
This is bad.

08:48.780 --> 08:51.160
This is really, really bad.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.370
Aang, you don't have to do this alone.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.960
Yeah, if we all fight
the Fire Lord together,

08:57.080 --> 08:58.750
we've got a shot at taking him down.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.500

09:09.720 --> 09:11.260
Fighting the Fire Lord

09:11.390 --> 09:13.430
is gonna be the hardest thing
we've ever done together.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.810

you need to know

09:35.200 --> 09:36.660
before facing my father...

09:37.370 --> 09:38.960
How to redirect lightning.

09:40.420 --> 09:42.830
If you let the energy
in your own body flow,

09:42.960 --> 09:44.380
the lightning will follow it.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.920
You turn your opponents'
energy against them.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.470
- That's like waterbending.
- Exactly.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.550
My uncle invented this technique himself

09:51.630 --> 09:52.800
by studying waterbenders.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.430
So, have you ever
redirected lightning before?

09:56.560 --> 09:57.680

after Azula shot you.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.280
First, Suki and I will draw his fire.

10:55.410 --> 10:58.990
Then Katara and Zuko charge in
with some liquidy hot offense,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.000
and while the Melon Lord is distracted,

11:01.120 --> 11:05.210

13:33.060 --> 13:34.610
You're going to defend him?

13:34.690 --> 13:36.440
No, I agree with you.

13:36.570 --> 13:38.570
Fire Lord Ozai is a horrible person,

13:38.700 --> 13:40.740
and the world will probably
be better off without him,

13:40.860 --> 13:42.570
but there's gotta be another way.

13:42.700 --> 13:43.990
ZUKO: Like what?

13:44.120 --> 13:45.280
I don't know.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.790
Maybe we can make some big pots of glue

13:47.870 --> 13:49.120
and then I can use gluebending

13:49.250 --> 13:50.540
to stick his arms and legs together

13:50.670 --> 13:52.130
so he can't bend anymore.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.170
Yeah, then you can show
him his baby pictures

13:54.290 --> 13:56.300
and all those happy memories
will make him good again.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.050
Do you really think that would work?

13:58.420 --> 14:00.260
- No!
-( SIGHS HEAVILY )

14:01.970 --> 14:04.800
This goes against everything
I learned from the monks.

14:04.930 --> 14:07.640
I can't just go around
wiping out people I don't like.

14:07.770 --> 14:10.060
Sure, you can. You're the Avatar.

14:10.180 --> 14:11.730
If it's in the name of keeping balance,

14:11.850 --> 14:14.150
I'm pretty sure the universe
will forgive you.

14:14.560 --> 14:16.520
This isn't a joke, Sokka!

14:16.650 --> 14:18.900
None of you understand
the position I'm in!

14:19.030 --> 14:21.280
Aang, we do understand. It's just―

14:21.360 --> 14:23.070
Just what, Katara, what?

14:23.160 --> 14:24.950
We're trying to help.

14:25.070 --> 14:27.290
When you figure out a way
for me to beat the Fire Lord

14:27.410 --> 14:29.910
without taking his life,
I'd love to hear it!

14:31.540 --> 14:33.790
Aang, don't walk away from this.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.420
Let him go.

14:37.550 --> 14:40.010
He needs time to sort it out by himself.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.150
( CHATTERING )

14:57.270 --> 14:58.610
Hey, Momo.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.820
I don't suppose you know what I should do.

15:01.190 --> 15:02.450
( SQUAWKS )

15:02.570 --> 15:03.860
I didn't think so.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.710
MEN: ( DEEP-TONED HYPNOTIC CHANTING )

15:37.020 --> 15:39.360
( HYPNOTIC CHANT CONTINUES )

16:03.840 --> 16:05.050
SOKKA: Okay, that's everything.

16:05.170 --> 16:07.800
No, it's not. Where's Aang?

16:12.350 --> 16:14.890
Aang? Aang?

16:15.020 --> 16:16.890
Come on, lazy bones, let's go!

16:18.770 --> 16:20.150
( DOOR CREAKS, THUDS )

16:30.830 --> 16:32.410
He left his staff.

16:32.540 --> 16:33.700
That's so strange.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.870
Aang's not in a house.
Let's check the beach.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.460
SOKKA: Look! There's his footprints.

16:41.590 --> 16:43.090
The trail ends here.

16:43.550 --> 16:46.720
So, he went for a midnight
swim and never came back?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.340
Maybe he was captured.

16:48.470 --> 16:50.800
I don't think so.
There's no sign of a struggle.

16:50.930 --> 16:52.600
I bet he ran away again.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.310
Uh-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.

16:55.430 --> 16:56.890
Then what do you think

16:57.020 --> 16:58.480
happened to him, oh, sleuthy one?

16:59.190 --> 17:01.060
It's pretty obvious.

17:01.190 --> 17:03.480
Aang mysteriously disappears
before an important battle?

17:03.770 --> 17:06.280
He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.160
But if he was,
wouldn't his body still be here?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.030
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.030
KATARA: Then he's gotta be
somewhere on Ember Island.

17:13.160 --> 17:14.700
Let's split up and look for him.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.580
I'm going with Zuko!

17:16.660 --> 17:18.210
What?

17:18.330 --> 17:20.880
Everyone else went on
a life-changing field-trip with Zuko.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.170
Now, it's my turn.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.470
CROWD: ( CHANTING ) Aang! Aang!

17:36.060 --> 17:37.850
( CHANTING CONTINUES )

17:39.730 --> 17:42.310
- Avatar State, yip-yip!
- CROWD: ( CHEERING )

17:42.400 --> 17:44.150
BOTH: ( GROWLING )

17:44.440 --> 17:47.150
TOPH: And then when I was
nine, I ran away again.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.400
- Uh-huh.
- I know I shouldn't complain.

17:49.530 --> 17:52.030
My parents gave me
everything I ever asked for.

17:52.160 --> 17:55.080
But they never gave the one
thing that I really wanted...

17:55.200 --> 17:57.160
Their love, you know what I mean?

17:57.250 --> 17:58.540
( GROANS )

17:58.660 --> 18:00.790
Look, I know you had a rough childhood.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.130
But we should really
focus on finding Aang.

18:04.670 --> 18:06.920
This is the worst field-trip ever.

18:07.050 --> 18:08.630
( BLOWS )

18:14.600 --> 18:15.890
Judging by the looks on your faces,

18:16.010 --> 18:18.270
I'm guessing you guys
didn't find Aang, either.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.350
No.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.940
It's like he just disappeared.

18:24.060 --> 18:25.520
Hey, wait a minute.

18:25.650 --> 18:27.730
Has anyone noticed that
Momo is missing, too?

18:27.860 --> 18:31.860
Oh, no! I knew it
was only a matter of time!

18:32.860 --> 18:35.120
Appa ate Momo!

18:35.320 --> 18:37.700
Momo, I'm coming for you, buddy!

18:37.990 --> 18:41.580
Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo.
He's probably with Aang.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.170
That's just what Appa wants you to think.

18:45.460 --> 18:47.460
ZUKO: Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka.

18:47.590 --> 18:49.260
We have a real problem here.

18:49.380 --> 18:52.430
Aang is nowhere to be found and
the comet is only two days away.

18:52.550 --> 18:54.890
What should we do, Zuko?

18:55.390 --> 18:56.800
I don't know.

18:59.850 --> 19:01.480
Why are you all looking at me?

19:01.680 --> 19:04.440
Well, you are kind of
the expert on tracking Aang.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.610
Yeah, if anyone's got experience
hunting the Avatar, it's you.

19:13.450 --> 19:15.570
Zuko, I don't wanna tell
you how to do your job,

19:15.700 --> 19:17.740
but why we are heading
towards the Earth Kingdom?

19:18.160 --> 19:19.740
There's no way Aang's there.

19:19.870 --> 19:21.580
Just trust me.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.140
Come on, slowpokes, faster!

20:04.790 --> 20:06.370
Sorry I'm late, Father.

20:06.500 --> 20:10.090
Good palanquin bearers are
so hard to come by these days.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.760
So, is everything ready for our departure?

20:12.880 --> 20:15.090
There has been a change of plans, Azula.

20:15.220 --> 20:16.220
What?

20:16.300 --> 20:20.350
I've decided to lead the fleet
of airships to Ba Sing Se alone.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.770
You will remain here in the Fire Nation.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.690
But, I thought we were
going to do this together.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.440
My decision is final.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.780
You... You can't treat me like this!

20:32.900 --> 20:34.740
You can't treat me like Zuko!

20:34.860 --> 20:37.360
Azula, silence yourself.

20:37.490 --> 20:39.990
But it was my idea to burn
everything to the ground.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.910
I deserve to be by your side!

20:42.030 --> 20:44.750
Azula!

20:44.870 --> 20:46.120
Listen to me.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.130
I need you here
to watch over the homeland.

20:49.250 --> 20:53.800
It's a very important job that
I can only entrust to you.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.300
Really?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.550
And for your loyalty,

20:57.680 --> 21:01.350
I've decided to declare you
the new Fire Lord.

21:02.140 --> 21:04.180
Fire Lord Azula?

21:04.310 --> 21:06.980
It does seems appropriate.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.560
But, what about you?

21:08.850 --> 21:12.190
Fire Lord Ozai is no more.

21:12.310 --> 21:15.360
Just as the world will be reborn in fire,

21:15.480 --> 21:19.990
I shall be reborn
as the supreme ruler of the world.

21:20.110 --> 21:23.740
From this moment on, I will be known as...

21:23.870 --> 21:25.830
The Phoenix King!

21:59.280 --> 22:01.530

is what now?

with the giant mole.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.500
KATARA: Mole? Her skin is flawless.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.000
SOKKA: No, she has this
giant mole-creature

22:14.130 --> 22:15.590
she rides around on.

22:15.790 --> 22:16.960
The Shirshu.

22:17.090 --> 22:18.880
It's the only animal that
can track Aang's scent

22:19.010 --> 22:20.550
anywhere in the world.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.510
It's the one shot we have of finding him.
