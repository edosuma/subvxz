00:12.371 --> 00:15.208
Everyone into the helicopter bay!

00:18.946 --> 00:21.915
Come on, soldiers! Get in there!

00:21.949 --> 00:23.517
Now, people! Move it!

00:23.550 --> 00:25.553
Move it!

00:27.487 --> 00:29.189
Do as you're told!

00:29.222 --> 00:32.192
Everybody stay where you are!

00:32.223 --> 00:34.527
Freeze! Freeze!

00:34.561 --> 00:35.830
Security breach!

00:37.064 --> 00:39.098
Where's the master-at-arms?

00:39.132 --> 00:41.936
We need the armory. Come on.

00:41.968 --> 00:43.770
M.A.!

00:48.942 --> 00:50.210
Now, people! Move it!

00:50.242 --> 00:52.446
Everybody, get in the helo bay now!

00:52.479 --> 00:53.981
This is our chance ...

00:54.013 --> 00:55.949
before they get reinforcements on board.

00:55.982 --> 00:57.885
No, we do anything to provoke them now,

00:57.918 --> 00:59.219
they'll mow everybody down.

00:59.251 --> 01:01.187
There'll be a time, but it's not now.

01:04.257 --> 01:06.794
You were vacationing in
Jamaica when the virus broke.

01:06.826 --> 01:08.495
You were stranded on the fishing boat.

01:08.528 --> 01:10.229
We picked you up there with bertrise.

01:10.263 --> 01:11.632
I don't understand.

01:11.665 --> 01:13.133
They're here to steal the cure.

01:13.166 --> 01:15.102
You cannot be related to Quincy.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.439
Come on, Quincy. Stay with us, okay?

01:18.472 --> 01:20.808
Quincy, look at me.

01:20.841 --> 01:23.143
He's losing a lot of blood.

01:23.175 --> 01:24.478
He's bleeding out!

01:24.511 --> 01:25.746
Hand me that rag!

01:25.771 --> 01:26.581
What? What? What ... what rag?

01:26.606 --> 01:28.381
Right there ... hand it to me!

01:28.406 --> 01:29.881
Okay.

01:29.906 --> 01:31.081
Okay.

01:31.106 --> 01:34.381
Listen, asshole, anything
happens to Dr. Scott,

01:34.406 --> 01:36.176
this man is your insurance policy.

01:36.201 --> 01:39.181
You need to get our
ship's doctor up here now!

01:55.049 --> 01:57.418
Search the lab. Find the primordial.

01:57.443 --> 02:00.322
We'll move the heavy equipment out
and load them onto the boats later.

02:00.347 --> 02:04.919
Right now, I want computers,
samples, cultures, research.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.356
We leave nothing behind.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.083
Do as you're told, and nobody gets hurt!

02:13.135 --> 02:15.701
This is not good. Not good.

02:17.060 --> 02:19.441
We get locked in there,
we're gonna be toast.

02:19.466 --> 02:21.167
What the hell are we supposed to do?

02:21.200 --> 02:23.669
Come on, people! Move it!

02:23.702 --> 02:25.171
We got to make a play here.

02:25.205 --> 02:28.001
Rally at the D.C. locker.
Get there when you can.

02:28.026 --> 02:29.294
What?!

02:29.319 --> 02:31.302
Stop!

02:54.611 --> 02:58.811
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -

03:11.838 --> 03:13.807
All right, let's get these pallets unloaded

03:13.832 --> 03:15.567
and get this van back to Avocet.

03:15.592 --> 03:17.427
All right, boss.

03:20.093 --> 03:21.795
Make sure those cases are sealed.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.196
Will do.

03:44.593 --> 03:46.128
Keys to the van.

03:46.153 --> 03:47.922
Now.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.332
Cobra team, this is
vulture team. Do you copy?

03:59.366 --> 04:00.807
- Daddy?
- Cobra team, do you copy?

04:00.832 --> 04:02.936
It's okay, sweetheart. We're okay.

04:02.961 --> 04:05.012
We're gonna make it through this.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.170
Do you copy?

04:06.195 --> 04:07.564
There's no contact.

04:07.589 --> 04:09.174
But the rally point's still
got to be the container yard.

04:09.199 --> 04:10.959
That hasn't changed.

04:11.311 --> 04:13.546
They're still killing
people inside that stadium.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.048
I know.

04:19.385 --> 04:21.954
How hard can they be to find?

04:21.988 --> 04:24.291
They're wearing Navy uniforms.

04:24.323 --> 04:27.159
They shot two troopers ...
probably long gone by now.

04:27.193 --> 04:29.695
Nothing slows down at Olympia. You hear me?

04:29.729 --> 04:31.031
The machine keeps moving.

04:31.063 --> 04:31.862
Yes, ma'am.

04:37.536 --> 04:39.873
All right, move it into the hangar.

04:39.906 --> 04:41.875
Let's go!

04:41.907 --> 04:43.542
Get them seated.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.206
Sit down! Put your hands
where I can see them!

04:46.231 --> 04:47.766
Do a sweep, see if we missed anyone.

04:47.791 --> 04:48.748
Yes, sir.

04:48.782 --> 04:50.484
- All right, hang in there, Quincy.
- Come on.

04:50.517 --> 04:51.885
- Bring him over.
- Hang in there.

04:51.918 --> 04:54.054
Doc!

04:57.056 --> 04:59.825
Okay, the doctor's here, okay?

04:59.859 --> 05:01.094
Let's see his wound.

05:02.395 --> 05:04.164
This man has to go to
the medical bay right now!

05:04.197 --> 05:05.297
Not wasting manpower.

05:05.322 --> 05:08.092
Whatever you're gonna
do, you got to do it here.

05:08.723 --> 05:10.659
He's burning up. Somebody open a hatch.

05:11.308 --> 05:12.377
Somebody open a hatch!

05:12.402 --> 05:13.469
Do it!

05:16.943 --> 05:19.712
Come on, come on, come
on. Stay with me, okay?

05:29.168 --> 05:31.672
Go ... now! Now!

05:37.857 --> 05:39.313
Is that too tight?

05:39.338 --> 05:40.841
I'm good. I'm good.

05:50.115 --> 05:51.317
Hold your fire!

05:51.342 --> 05:53.588
Captain. She took over our ship.

05:53.613 --> 05:55.718
Can't get through to comms,
the bridge, or the C.I.C.

05:55.743 --> 05:57.610
I don't get it. What's her game plan?

05:57.635 --> 05:58.810
You wouldn't believe it.

05:58.835 --> 06:00.304
What the hell country are we even in?

06:00.329 --> 06:02.160
Have you guys heard from Alisha?
Is she involved with this?

06:02.185 --> 06:03.154
Never mind that now.

06:03.410 --> 06:04.480
How you feeling?

06:04.505 --> 06:05.460
It was through and through.

06:05.485 --> 06:06.620
He's lost a lot of blood, sir.

06:06.645 --> 06:08.230
I'm fine. What's our play, sir?

06:08.255 --> 06:09.558
Got to get back to the James.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.886
Plenty of small boats in
the harbor. Maybe a rhib.

06:11.911 --> 06:13.880
Nah, she's taken the pier by now,

06:14.003 --> 06:15.800
and those helos circling our ship ...

06:15.825 --> 06:17.861
no way we could even make an approach.

06:18.041 --> 06:21.317
Right now, Dr. Scott's our primary mission,

06:21.342 --> 06:23.207
and she's Granderson's prisoner.

06:23.232 --> 06:25.154
Avocet's got armed guards, electric fences,

06:25.179 --> 06:26.293
security cams on every floor.

06:26.318 --> 06:28.447
We saw armored cars and
plenty of weapons at Olympia.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.511
So, then, what ... we take on

06:29.536 --> 06:31.038
all of her troopers without our ship?

06:31.063 --> 06:32.911
4 of us against 80 of them ...

06:32.936 --> 06:34.971
I don't like those odds.

06:37.125 --> 06:39.811
You guys remember Russ, right?

06:40.462 --> 06:42.164
Okay, guys, here's the plan.

06:42.197 --> 06:44.500
Russ is gonna hang with you guys
and grandpa for a while, all right?

06:44.532 --> 06:46.222
You're gonna die ... like mom.

06:46.247 --> 06:47.081
You can't leave us.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.409
No, no, Sammy, I'm not.

06:48.434 --> 06:50.838
It's okay, Sam, do what dad says.

06:51.239 --> 06:54.543
Come on. Give your pops a hug.
We all have things to do now.

06:55.777 --> 06:57.212
I love you, dad.

06:57.246 --> 06:59.916
I love you, too, son.

07:00.447 --> 07:01.962
Come here, sweet girl.

07:03.652 --> 07:06.488
Be safe, dad.

07:18.370 --> 07:19.405
Let's move.

07:19.430 --> 07:20.957
Where are we going, sir?

07:20.982 --> 07:22.757
Taking down the queen bee.

07:22.782 --> 07:25.185
To do that...

07:25.592 --> 07:28.162
We hit her where it hurts the most.

07:35.231 --> 07:39.380
We have successfully taken
control of the Nathan James.

07:39.405 --> 07:43.143
My people are collecting
all your work as we speak.

07:43.314 --> 07:46.880
Now, with your research and your samples,

07:46.905 --> 07:48.669
Dr. Hamada and his team

07:48.694 --> 07:51.425
will eventually learn to
make the cure themselves.

07:51.450 --> 07:53.610
Wouldn't it be better for everyone

07:53.635 --> 07:55.600
if you just agreed to work together?

07:55.625 --> 07:56.926
Work together?

07:57.371 --> 07:59.889
What, on your Darwinian experiment?

08:00.014 --> 08:02.444
Save those that you deem worthy

08:02.484 --> 08:04.897
and, what, just forget the rest?

08:04.922 --> 08:06.523
Perhaps I was overzealous in ...

08:06.548 --> 08:07.783
"barbarians at the gate,"

08:07.815 --> 08:10.018
I believe, is what you called them.

08:10.043 --> 08:14.725
Doctor, I watched a grown man
beat a 12-year-old boy to death

08:14.750 --> 08:16.458
over a gas mask.

08:16.483 --> 08:19.592
I saw a woman stab her sister in the back

08:19.617 --> 08:21.086
for a can of beans.

08:21.111 --> 08:22.613
The apocalypse is here.

08:22.638 --> 08:25.037
It's been here for a long time.

08:26.025 --> 08:29.704
But I am willing to adjust my philosophy

08:29.738 --> 08:31.530
to suit your sensibilities

08:31.555 --> 08:35.392
if you just help me get
the lab up and running.

08:36.407 --> 08:39.143
What about the captain?

08:39.746 --> 08:40.849
And my friends?

08:40.881 --> 08:42.501
The best thing you can do for your friends

08:42.527 --> 08:45.111
is to let them know you've
decided to cooperate with me.

08:45.136 --> 08:47.663
That will end this foolish bloodshed.

08:47.688 --> 08:50.291
You say you'll help everyone?

08:50.324 --> 08:51.158
I will.

08:51.183 --> 08:52.551
Well, then, prove it.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.896
And how do you suggest I do that?

08:54.929 --> 08:57.165
You're wasting doses
here on healthy people.

08:57.198 --> 08:59.901
Let me out into the street
with what I have left ...

08:59.934 --> 09:03.039
save people who are already sick.

09:06.623 --> 09:09.112
What, you think I'm gonna try to escape?

09:09.566 --> 09:10.935
I think it's silly.

09:11.131 --> 09:13.823
And given the state of the
world, I think it's small.

09:13.848 --> 09:18.887
But if that's what's important to you...

09:37.438 --> 09:39.442
All right, get ready.

09:53.822 --> 09:55.137
Clear!

09:55.162 --> 09:57.465
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.459
Come on.

09:59.484 --> 10:01.321
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

10:03.511 --> 10:05.614
Looks like there's power.

10:05.742 --> 10:07.917
Yeah, courtesy of my daughter-in-law

10:07.942 --> 10:10.205
and several thousand
other people at Olympia.

10:10.237 --> 10:12.542
You'll be safe here.

11:10.664 --> 11:12.068
Feel that heat?

11:16.747 --> 11:18.815
It's got to be O'Connor.

11:27.614 --> 11:29.823
This isn't it. It's got to be here!

11:29.848 --> 11:32.250
Search everything! I know it's here!

11:32.415 --> 11:35.264
Look in everything of hers!
Tear up the entire ship!

11:35.289 --> 11:37.057
We have to find the primordial!

12:09.558 --> 12:12.093
Next one goes between your eyes.

12:12.126 --> 12:14.630
Okay.

12:18.132 --> 12:19.468
Easy, kid.

12:19.501 --> 12:20.970
What are you doing here?

12:21.002 --> 12:22.237
You sick?

12:22.270 --> 12:23.680
Do I look like I'm sick? No.

12:23.705 --> 12:26.975
Just needed a place to crash for the night.

12:27.008 --> 12:28.844
Here.

12:28.876 --> 12:30.846
You look hungry.

12:30.879 --> 12:32.295
I don't want your food.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.856
I get what I need underground.

12:33.881 --> 12:35.383
And I'm not sick.

12:35.417 --> 12:39.388
I put that red "x" up there
to keep dirtbags like you away.

12:40.422 --> 12:41.990
All right, well...

12:43.191 --> 12:45.511
Put the gun down. We'll
talk like grown-ups.

12:45.536 --> 12:48.607
If you're here, you work
for the old lady at Avocet.

12:48.632 --> 12:50.935
You're not taking me to Olympia to die.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.595
No.

12:52.620 --> 12:55.257
I'm with the U.S. Navy
ship. I have the cure.

12:55.282 --> 12:57.518
Stay... Back.

12:59.106 --> 13:03.044
Kid, I'm telling you ...
I'm one of the good guys.

13:03.077 --> 13:05.646
And what are you talking about? Avocet?

13:05.679 --> 13:06.914
You mean Mrs. Granderson?

13:06.947 --> 13:08.449
Her workers come through at night,

13:08.474 --> 13:09.792
pretending to be doctors,

13:09.935 --> 13:11.785
but they're just clearing out the sick

13:11.810 --> 13:13.686
so she can move her people in.

13:13.772 --> 13:15.186
"Her people"?

13:16.342 --> 13:18.245
You really have no clue.

13:18.270 --> 13:19.738
No, man.

13:19.763 --> 13:20.903
I...

13:20.928 --> 13:24.186
Do me a favor. Grab a seat.

13:24.211 --> 13:27.381
Start from the beginning.

13:27.902 --> 13:30.105
Where are you taking me?

13:30.138 --> 13:32.173
The executive wing.

13:32.206 --> 13:33.855
Your mother wants you and Dr. Scott

13:33.880 --> 13:36.250
in more comfortable quarters.

13:36.477 --> 13:37.846
She cares about you.

13:37.879 --> 13:40.048
Eventually, you'll see that.

13:40.081 --> 13:44.086
... including Perseus,
Hercules, and Achilles.

13:45.887 --> 13:46.890
Make your lists.

13:46.915 --> 13:49.491
There'll be a quiz on this
at the end of the week.

13:50.820 --> 13:52.678
All these people...

13:54.062 --> 13:57.099
... do they know what my
mother's really got going on here?

13:58.332 --> 14:02.378
Ask any of them ...
you'll hear the same thing.

14:02.403 --> 14:03.505
They're grateful.

14:03.530 --> 14:05.979
Everyone here has a job.

14:06.004 --> 14:07.940
We all pitch in.

14:08.610 --> 14:10.178
It's a community.

14:17.418 --> 14:19.654
How could you not have
secured the lab first?

14:19.687 --> 14:21.521
It was the most important part of your job.

14:21.546 --> 14:22.478
I'll find it.

14:22.503 --> 14:23.476
You'd better,

14:23.501 --> 14:26.002
'cause we cannot make the
cure without the primordial.

14:26.027 --> 14:27.129
You understand?

14:33.201 --> 14:36.004
He's stabilized for now,
but he needs more stitches,

14:36.029 --> 14:37.914
and if this clamp comes loose,
he'll bleed out in seconds.

14:37.940 --> 14:40.915
You hear that, Quincy? You got
to be real careful how you move.

14:40.940 --> 14:43.610
Where's the primordial?

14:47.458 --> 14:49.274
Hey! He didn't steal it.

14:49.299 --> 14:51.152
It was on the bridge when
you took over the ship.

14:51.177 --> 14:52.979
Well, maybe he stashed it before.

14:53.362 --> 14:55.132
I'm sure you got some adrenaline

14:55.157 --> 14:56.508
or something in there to perk him up.

14:56.533 --> 14:58.607
I'm not pumping up his
heart rate. It'll kill him.

14:59.003 --> 15:01.440
Don't make me ask twice.

15:20.082 --> 15:21.391
Go ahead.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.918
Coming through.

15:27.389 --> 15:29.024
Here we go.

16:12.900 --> 16:15.436
- Back it up.
- Come on.

16:49.950 --> 16:50.918
Oh.

16:51.061 --> 16:52.062
You're late.

16:52.158 --> 16:54.861
What'd you guys do, take the scenic route?

16:54.886 --> 16:56.788
A couple of a-holes
tried to hijack our suits.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.052
Believe that?

16:59.077 --> 17:01.974
Yeah, this town, man ... crazy, crazy.

17:01.999 --> 17:04.269
Yeah. You're telling me.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.305
You guys new around here?
I've never seen you before.

17:29.459 --> 17:30.728
Let's go! Hands up!

17:30.753 --> 17:32.589
Now! Down!

17:32.614 --> 17:34.982
You guys over there ...
everyone, take a knee.

17:35.016 --> 17:36.250
Let us see your hands!

17:36.283 --> 17:37.752
Hands up!

17:37.786 --> 17:39.520
Let's go!

17:54.968 --> 17:56.904
Step right up, brother. Get your cure.

17:56.938 --> 17:58.840
Have your payments ready. Canned food only.

17:58.872 --> 18:00.342
Here you go.

18:00.374 --> 18:02.678
Remember, you got to take it
twice a day, morning and night,

18:02.710 --> 18:04.179
or else the cure's just not gonna work.

18:04.211 --> 18:06.314
All right, who's next? Don't be shy.

18:06.347 --> 18:09.483
Don't worry. I have enough for everyone.

18:09.516 --> 18:11.953
Oh, come on!

18:16.858 --> 18:19.194
People are actually doing this?

18:19.227 --> 18:21.530
People are always taking
advantage of the sick.

18:21.563 --> 18:23.480
Been going on for months.

18:24.631 --> 18:27.535
This is what we thought
we were fighting against.

18:30.205 --> 18:31.807
No.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.456
Please ...

18:33.481 --> 18:36.117
wait.

18:36.225 --> 18:39.763
I have something that will make you better.

18:39.788 --> 18:42.258
I have the real cure.

18:43.204 --> 18:46.401
Granderson thinks this is insignificant.

18:47.522 --> 18:51.059
It's not insignificant.

18:51.092 --> 18:52.701
You have to believe me ...

18:52.726 --> 18:55.070
I-I didn't know what
she was doing at Olympia.

18:55.095 --> 18:59.300
Aside from Hamada, most of
the doctors and staff ...

18:59.767 --> 19:01.202
we thought we were helping.

19:01.743 --> 19:03.378
You'll have time to redeem yourself

19:03.403 --> 19:04.905
when the others come for me.

19:05.873 --> 19:07.942
And they will.

19:39.407 --> 19:40.442
Stairs!

20:14.135 --> 20:16.471
Don't shoot! I'm on your side!

20:16.496 --> 20:18.441
I'm with Thorwald ... the rebels.

20:19.346 --> 20:20.214
What rebels?

20:20.247 --> 20:21.583
They call us warlords.

20:21.615 --> 20:24.519
I can show you. I can take you to the man.

20:32.259 --> 20:35.129
It's been hours. Where is he?

20:35.162 --> 20:37.731
He's all right, Ashley. He'll be just fine.

20:38.054 --> 20:40.824
Come on, Ash. Eat some soup.

20:42.303 --> 20:44.805
Yeah, hey, sit down over there.

20:44.839 --> 20:47.175
Have something to eat.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.276
Here.

20:54.282 --> 20:56.351
I always knew Tommy would get through this.

20:56.383 --> 20:58.690
If anybody could, it was my son.

20:58.715 --> 21:00.663
He knew what was at stake for everyone.

21:00.688 --> 21:03.024
He wasn't gonna let us
fail, and he won't now.

21:03.056 --> 21:05.293
I failed him.

21:05.325 --> 21:08.319
If he didn't get to Olympia when he did...

21:08.729 --> 21:10.720
If this city is any indication

21:10.745 --> 21:13.345
of what's become of our
country, Mr. Chandler,

21:13.668 --> 21:14.870
as far as I'm concerned,

21:14.902 --> 21:17.171
you're a hero for surviving this long.

21:22.839 --> 21:24.741
Sam, what's wrong?

21:24.766 --> 21:27.798
I... I don't feel so good.

21:33.321 --> 21:35.524
Understand. I'll take care of it.

21:43.534 --> 21:46.037
Hey, man, we've been
sitting here for hours.

21:46.062 --> 21:47.724
- Hey!
- Everybody's sweating their balls off.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.251
And people got to use the head.

21:49.276 --> 21:50.678
Cruz, come on.

21:50.703 --> 21:51.803
Come here! Take it easy.

21:52.702 --> 21:55.205
Yo, come on, baby!

21:55.230 --> 21:56.277
Get off me!

21:56.945 --> 21:58.580
All right!

21:58.612 --> 22:00.795
Do you see what's happening
here? Can you feel this?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.584
Yeah. It's hot. We'll open the door.

22:02.609 --> 22:04.178
The thermostat isn't the problem.

22:04.619 --> 22:05.754
The engine's overheating

22:05.786 --> 22:07.481
because no one's down there to correct it.

22:07.506 --> 22:09.090
If the reduction gear blows,

22:09.122 --> 22:11.426
the ship will be totally useless to anyone.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.660
I'm assuming this is an asset

22:12.693 --> 22:14.094
your people can't afford to lose.

22:14.128 --> 22:16.097
Can you fix it?

22:16.130 --> 22:18.366
My engineer can.

22:18.399 --> 22:21.102
But in exchange, you
move us to the mess decks.

22:21.134 --> 22:24.439
There's food, water.
People can use the bathroom.

22:24.471 --> 22:27.441
You're not in any position
to be horse-trading with us.

22:28.653 --> 22:30.522
You're right about that.

22:30.547 --> 22:32.106
You're absolutely right.

22:32.427 --> 22:34.997
But do you see what's happening here?

22:37.317 --> 22:39.720
I won't be able to control my people.

22:44.491 --> 22:46.460
Come on!

22:46.494 --> 22:47.629
Can't rush it.

22:47.661 --> 22:51.165
The whole engineering
plant could go up in flames.

22:52.667 --> 22:53.635
Okay.

22:59.439 --> 23:01.442
Okay, there. Just made it.

23:01.476 --> 23:03.545
How long till it cools down?

23:03.577 --> 23:05.980
The air pumping through
those vents is 40 degrees.

23:06.014 --> 23:08.449
It won't take long.

23:24.849 --> 23:26.976
Is this really necessary?

23:27.001 --> 23:28.837
How are we supposed to use the head?

23:28.969 --> 23:30.505
This is not what we agreed to.

23:30.537 --> 23:32.392
I said I'd move you.

23:32.417 --> 23:34.253
Didn't say you'd be comfortable.

23:35.208 --> 23:37.176
Let's go.

23:38.649 --> 23:40.419
Move!

23:42.970 --> 23:45.090
Keep moving.

23:54.357 --> 23:56.661
It's okay, buddy. Stay strong.

24:01.620 --> 24:03.121
He's burning up.

24:03.146 --> 24:04.959
You sure there's nothing
in those medicine cabinets?

24:04.984 --> 24:06.421
Not even an aspirin.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.466
We can't let Sam die. We can't.

24:08.491 --> 24:11.150
The cure works. I'm sure he's
just having a bad reaction.

24:11.175 --> 24:13.057
We got to get this fever down.

24:13.491 --> 24:15.738
You got water. Run him a cold bath.

24:15.763 --> 24:17.156
I'll be back in a few minutes.

24:17.181 --> 24:18.616
Where are you going?

24:18.641 --> 24:21.111
To find a pharmacy.

24:21.152 --> 24:23.855
Here. Let's get him upstairs.

24:23.887 --> 24:25.455
Come on, buddy.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.954
Is it gonna hurt?

24:27.979 --> 24:30.981
No. It won't hurt at all.

24:31.006 --> 24:33.276
We'll all feel better soon.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.907
I'm so sorry ... I...

24:43.941 --> 24:46.376
I only have one more.

24:50.246 --> 24:52.550
My baby will live?

25:10.887 --> 25:13.057
You're a big, brave boy.

25:24.447 --> 25:27.084
Welcome to Avocet.

25:27.117 --> 25:29.386
Inside and to the left.

25:29.419 --> 25:30.887
What's your qualification?

25:30.921 --> 25:31.889
Electronics.

25:31.922 --> 25:33.758
I need to see wristbands.

25:33.790 --> 25:35.556
Qualification?

25:35.581 --> 25:36.735
I need to see wristbands

25:36.760 --> 25:39.063
to prove you've already been tested.

25:39.096 --> 25:40.798
I need to see wristbands.

25:40.823 --> 25:43.189
- What's your qualification?
- I don't understand.

25:43.214 --> 25:45.069
But we're healthy ... all of us.

25:45.101 --> 25:46.704
Sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

25:46.736 --> 25:48.906
Well, if you won't let us in,
where are we supposed to go?

25:49.849 --> 25:51.551
Thank you. Welcome to Avocet.

25:51.576 --> 25:53.545
Thank you.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.946
What's your qualification?

25:55.971 --> 25:57.106
Security.

25:57.131 --> 25:58.832
Thank you. Welcome to Avocet.

25:58.857 --> 25:59.926
No, no, no.

25:59.950 --> 26:02.826
We'll need bigger explosives
if we go to that side.

26:03.612 --> 26:05.964
The hell are you doing here?
Why aren't you at the plant?

26:05.989 --> 26:08.948
- Freeze!
- No, no, no! They're cool. They're cool.

26:08.973 --> 26:10.503
They're with me.

26:10.528 --> 26:12.262
They took out the power plant,

26:12.296 --> 26:13.998
got a bunch of Granderson's guys.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.666
So we lost our jump? She's
gonna know we're coming.

26:16.700 --> 26:17.768
We took out the plant.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.636
Doesn't mean we cut off the electricity.

26:19.669 --> 26:22.686
As far as Granderson knows,
her empire's still intact.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.781
This is Lieutenant Burk.

26:24.873 --> 26:27.253
I'm commander Tom Chandler,
United States Navy.

26:27.278 --> 26:28.445
Our ship made port this morning.

26:28.479 --> 26:29.735
I know who you are.

26:29.760 --> 26:31.985
I saw you making nice with
Granderson at the pier.

26:32.010 --> 26:33.712
I don't know you.

26:34.018 --> 26:37.688
At this point, I don't trust
anyone I meet in this town.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.890
But I know Granderson fears and hates you,

26:39.915 --> 26:41.459
so I'm operating on the premise

26:41.492 --> 26:43.793
that my enemy's enemy can be my friend.

26:43.827 --> 26:46.463
If that's the case, we can help each other.

26:47.463 --> 26:50.134
Granderson's choppers
hovering over your ship ...

26:50.166 --> 26:51.968
not there for your protection?

26:52.002 --> 26:53.738
Not quite, no.

26:58.509 --> 27:00.178
Relax your weapons.

27:09.752 --> 27:10.887
She fooled you.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.790
She had good references.

27:12.822 --> 27:14.324
Is it true you have the cure?

27:14.357 --> 27:16.027
The doctor who invented
it is being held at Avocet,

27:16.059 --> 27:18.361
along with the facilities
she needs to make more of it.

27:18.395 --> 27:21.537
Both she and the lab
must survive the fight,

27:21.562 --> 27:22.332
no matter what.

27:22.366 --> 27:24.202
You're late.

27:24.234 --> 27:25.890
We're taking Avocet tonight.

27:25.915 --> 27:27.050
You guys?

27:27.075 --> 27:28.543
You're outmanned and outgunned.

27:28.568 --> 27:29.536
What?

27:29.873 --> 27:31.309
You two are gonna call Granderson

27:31.341 --> 27:32.576
ask for her surrender?

27:32.609 --> 27:35.011
As soon as we cut off
the flow of electricity,

27:35.044 --> 27:37.914
she'll send everything
she's got to get it back ...

27:37.947 --> 27:41.621
from Avocet and my ship.

27:42.171 --> 27:44.206
Both will be vulnerable.

27:44.599 --> 27:47.470
Both will be taken by us.

27:48.892 --> 27:51.028
Then we can stop the killing at Olympia

27:51.060 --> 27:54.665
and get back to the
business of curing the world.

27:54.697 --> 27:58.461
Help me execute my plan, and
we'll take her out together.

27:58.735 --> 28:01.838
Even if she does send two
dozen troopers to the plant,

28:01.871 --> 28:04.841
you can't take Avocet
with a frontal assault.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.377
You got a better idea?

28:07.081 --> 28:10.421
What do you think we're
all doing down here?

28:15.252 --> 28:17.975
It's okay, Quincy. Doing okay?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.723
I don't like this. I don't like it at all.

28:19.757 --> 28:21.792
If we just give it up, we can
get him to the medical bay.

28:21.817 --> 28:23.782
No, if they find what they're looking for,

28:23.806 --> 28:26.264
it'll be open season on all of us.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.470
Well?

28:30.495 --> 28:32.680
I can't rush the adrenaline
drip. It'll blow out his heart.

28:32.705 --> 28:34.580
I need a couple more minutes.

29:00.329 --> 29:02.032
Watch them.

29:42.688 --> 29:44.991
You got five minutes.

29:53.517 --> 29:56.187
You crazy mo-fo. How the hell
did you get back on the ship?

29:56.220 --> 29:58.732
Climbed up the anchor chain.
Came right over the nose.

29:58.757 --> 29:59.669
Unbelievable.

29:59.694 --> 30:00.436
Yeah.

30:00.461 --> 30:02.666
So, what the hell do we do now?

30:04.360 --> 30:07.197
Get to the armory. Blow it up.

30:07.231 --> 30:08.332
And kick some ass.

30:08.365 --> 30:09.901
And kick some ass.

30:27.305 --> 30:30.465
Found it in Dr. Tophet's cabin.

30:32.054 --> 30:34.758
Mom, you and the girl are coming with me.

30:34.791 --> 30:35.925
Hey, yo.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.395
They ain't going nowhere.

30:37.427 --> 30:38.898
No way, no how.

30:38.923 --> 30:41.559
Now, just hang on,
everybody. Let's just be cool.

30:41.638 --> 30:44.053
There's 170 of us on this ship

30:44.078 --> 30:46.100
and, what ... 25 of you?

30:46.125 --> 30:47.923
You might take down some of us,

30:47.948 --> 30:49.726
but we will overrun you.

30:57.588 --> 30:59.456
I'll go! I'll go.

30:59.481 --> 31:01.085
Just ... just leave my daughter here.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.372
- Mom!
- I'll be all right, darling.

31:05.295 --> 31:07.231
It's all right, sweetie.

31:07.256 --> 31:09.526
She's gonna see your dad,
and they'll be right back.

31:09.551 --> 31:11.625
Sit him down.

31:15.231 --> 31:18.328
Where'd you stash it, big
man? I know it had to be you.

31:18.353 --> 31:20.426
Even if I did...

31:21.036 --> 31:22.827
Why would I tell you?

31:23.312 --> 31:24.947
God damn it.

31:24.972 --> 31:26.429
You tell me, or I'm gonna blow your ...

31:26.454 --> 31:27.554
Nothing they can do to you, Quincy.

31:27.579 --> 31:28.848
They need both you and Dr. Scott.

31:28.873 --> 31:30.675
Got a present for you.

31:31.121 --> 31:32.476
Quincy!

31:32.501 --> 31:34.296
Whatever it is they want,
just give it to them!

31:34.321 --> 31:35.295
Please!

31:35.320 --> 31:37.421
Yeah. You might be right.

31:37.446 --> 31:40.132
We may need him, but we don't need her.

31:40.419 --> 31:42.089
So somebody better start talking.

31:42.114 --> 31:43.631
Goddamn coward!

31:46.199 --> 31:48.296
What the hell is wrong with you people?!

31:48.321 --> 31:50.216
Now, I'm gonna count to
five, and I don't think

31:50.241 --> 31:52.609
I need to explain what happens
if you don't come clean!

31:52.634 --> 31:53.996
Okay.

31:54.529 --> 31:56.132
Please.

31:57.815 --> 31:58.950
I hid it.

31:59.531 --> 32:00.966
I know where it is.

32:02.974 --> 32:04.268
I'll kill her. You know I will.

32:04.293 --> 32:06.262
Okay.

32:07.270 --> 32:10.204
Okay. Okay.

32:13.664 --> 32:15.987
I love you, Kelly.

32:18.711 --> 32:20.747
I'm so sorry.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.287
Where is it?!

32:23.206 --> 32:26.186
You'll never find it.

33:10.009 --> 33:13.680
Welcome to reject city.

33:13.705 --> 33:15.440
People live here?

33:15.472 --> 33:17.107
487 at last count.

33:17.141 --> 33:19.944
Most of them tried to get
into Avocet at some point

33:19.977 --> 33:22.382
but were deemed not valuable.

33:22.486 --> 33:26.125
Granderson offers her
handpicked people security,

33:26.150 --> 33:27.485
a sense of normalcy.

33:28.129 --> 33:31.697
Everyone else eventually
finds their way underground.

33:31.722 --> 33:34.325
She'll secure as much
of the city as she can,

33:34.357 --> 33:36.169
then she'll come for us here.

33:36.194 --> 33:37.628
It's only a matter of time.

33:37.747 --> 33:40.771
And the troopers that work for Granderson,

33:41.531 --> 33:43.600
they know what she's doing at Olympia ...

33:44.050 --> 33:46.419
leading the sick to the slaughter

33:46.444 --> 33:48.146
and burning them for fuel?

33:48.171 --> 33:50.585
People do whatever they can to survive.

33:50.610 --> 33:52.613
They make their choices.

33:52.724 --> 33:55.360
She must have tried to recruit you.

33:55.865 --> 33:57.468
She did.

34:02.220 --> 34:05.957
I know everything that's
gone on in the past few days

34:05.990 --> 34:08.592
has been very confusing for you.

34:08.626 --> 34:13.030
It's a confusing world
now ... for all of us.

34:13.063 --> 34:14.498
But I assure you,

34:15.257 --> 34:19.973
I am trying to do as
little harm as possible.

34:19.998 --> 34:22.701
But you should know ...

34:23.500 --> 34:25.402
Dr. Tophet has died.

34:25.427 --> 34:27.362
He took his own life

34:27.388 --> 34:30.492
rather than to tell us
where he hid the primordial.

34:31.342 --> 34:33.110
So...

34:33.884 --> 34:38.088
I need your help to put
a stop to all of this.

34:41.152 --> 34:44.828
The only way any of this is going to end

34:44.862 --> 34:47.098
is for you to give up.

34:49.224 --> 34:52.862
As a lieutenant in the United States Navy,

34:52.887 --> 34:56.391
I am qualified to accept your surrender.

34:58.989 --> 35:01.892
My surrender?

35:01.917 --> 35:03.454
No.

35:05.027 --> 35:08.165
You stay with me, little girl.

35:08.190 --> 35:11.986
You watch who surrenders to whom.

35:49.307 --> 35:51.543
You really think you're
gonna get away with this?

35:51.568 --> 35:52.970
Shut up!

36:00.270 --> 36:02.572
I have all of her research.

36:02.605 --> 36:04.975
I could make the cure,
even without her help...

36:05.009 --> 36:07.077
If I had the primordial.

36:08.498 --> 36:10.634
That is the big "if" now.

36:12.750 --> 36:14.533
Wait a minute.

36:17.704 --> 36:19.507
Get Granderson on the radio.

36:22.793 --> 36:25.430
They just tossed his body overboard.

36:28.166 --> 36:29.801
Lock this asshole in the chart room.

36:29.826 --> 36:32.295
What the hell are you doing?

36:33.410 --> 36:35.461
Want to go for round 2?

36:36.273 --> 36:39.344
He tries to come out
of there, you shoot him.

36:41.779 --> 36:44.983
Lieutenant Foster, you're
going on a little trip.

36:45.016 --> 36:45.934
N-no, wait ... no.

36:45.935 --> 36:46.851
Hey!

36:46.884 --> 36:49.619
Get your hands off of me! Let go of me! No!

36:49.652 --> 36:51.788
Watch it.

36:51.822 --> 36:54.291
Wait, no! Wait! No!

37:08.186 --> 37:09.521
I thought we were going to the lab.

37:09.546 --> 37:11.181
Granderson wants to see the genius.

37:11.206 --> 37:13.518
Apparently, her assistant
hid something important ...

37:13.543 --> 37:15.016
bit the bullet rather than give it up.

37:15.041 --> 37:16.810
Dr. Tophet?

37:16.835 --> 37:18.503
I don't know his name.

37:29.860 --> 37:31.632
Going down?

37:47.561 --> 37:48.863
Go ahead.

37:48.888 --> 37:51.058
I'll take care of him.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.251
I thought you left.

37:53.284 --> 37:55.320
Huh? Oh. I made a new friend.

37:55.353 --> 37:57.421
He told me what was going on down here.

37:57.454 --> 38:00.157
I figured I'd come see it for myself.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.003
How you doing, Sammy?

38:12.606 --> 38:14.072
It didn't work.

38:14.104 --> 38:16.275
Ice-cold bath, and he's still on fire.

38:16.307 --> 38:18.184
We got to call dad.

38:18.209 --> 38:21.099
No, no, no, no. We're not
dragging your father back here.

38:21.124 --> 38:22.892
Russ will come back.

38:22.917 --> 38:25.854
And... Sammy will be all right.

38:26.017 --> 38:28.752
I'm giving him 20 more minutes.

38:28.785 --> 38:30.098
You're not giving him anything.

38:30.123 --> 38:32.497
I can go out there! No one will see me!

38:32.522 --> 38:35.013
No! You're not going anywhere.

38:35.038 --> 38:37.174
You're staying here with us.

38:39.916 --> 38:41.985
I'm not gonna let Sam die.

38:42.292 --> 38:44.049
Ohhh.

38:44.074 --> 38:45.696
Look.

38:47.905 --> 38:51.008
The master chief ... he went on foot.

38:51.041 --> 38:52.810
It takes time.

38:52.843 --> 38:56.715
And if there's medicine
to be found, he'll find it.

39:04.421 --> 39:08.327
And if someone's gonna go, it'll be me.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.685
20 minutes.

39:41.792 --> 39:44.337
There's an old fire escape
... runs off the back,

39:44.362 --> 39:45.863
drops off behind a bunch of dumpsters.

39:45.896 --> 39:48.165
I scouted the joint. It's
the only safe way out.

39:48.198 --> 39:49.735
Let me go! I won't ...

39:49.767 --> 39:50.836
Let's go.

39:50.869 --> 39:53.005
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

39:53.037 --> 39:55.512
Is that Kara?

39:55.537 --> 39:57.273
Oh, God. No.

39:58.236 --> 40:00.044
They must have discovered the pregnancy.

40:00.286 --> 40:03.089
They're gonna use the
unborn child's stem cells

40:03.114 --> 40:04.749
to re-create a vaccine.

40:04.781 --> 40:06.650
You go on. Take the ladder from the roof.

40:06.683 --> 40:08.552
I'll take care of her, find Alisha, too.

40:08.585 --> 40:10.870
No way ... I think I know
where they'll take her,

40:10.895 --> 40:12.598
and I can show you.

40:12.849 --> 40:14.920
Difficult woman.

40:16.639 --> 40:17.778
Let's go. Come on.

40:17.803 --> 40:18.503
Yes, Doctor.

40:18.528 --> 40:21.487
Get her on the table.
Warm up the equipment.

40:21.512 --> 40:23.587
No! No!!

40:23.612 --> 40:25.401
Stop! No! Stop!

40:25.426 --> 40:27.807
Hurry up! Quickly! Take her coveralls off!

40:28.491 --> 40:29.549
I can't!

40:29.574 --> 40:30.876
Just open it up!

40:30.901 --> 40:31.643
Stop! Stop!

40:31.668 --> 40:32.753
Come on! Quickly!

40:32.778 --> 40:34.341
Help me!

40:36.171 --> 40:38.173
The Avocet sub-basement's right above us.

40:38.198 --> 40:39.401
She'll never hear us coming.

40:39.426 --> 40:40.993
We're gonna do this your way,

40:41.018 --> 40:43.041
so let's hope your guy keeps
the lights out long enough.

40:43.066 --> 40:44.500
Sundown is in five minutes.

40:44.525 --> 40:46.561
We need to find our
people and secure the lab.

40:46.586 --> 40:50.390
Do what you got to do.
I only want Granderson.

40:52.138 --> 40:53.023
Calm down!

40:53.048 --> 40:53.866
Lieutenant!

40:53.891 --> 40:54.547
No!

40:54.572 --> 40:55.489
Listen to me!

40:57.272 --> 40:59.367
Do you want to save your baby? Huh?

40:59.392 --> 41:01.695
Lieutenant, listen to me.
Do you hear what I'm saying?

41:02.048 --> 41:03.950
Do you want to save your baby?

41:04.223 --> 41:07.219
'Cause I haven't done
surgery since medical school.

41:07.244 --> 41:09.847
So if you want at least
one of you to survive,

41:09.872 --> 41:12.524
I'm gonna need you to
calm down and sit still.

41:12.549 --> 41:14.124
You understand?
