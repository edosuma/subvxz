00:03.200 --> 00:04.600
Shh!
I didn't say anything.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.200
Stop talking.
That's talking.

00:06.360 --> 00:08.955
You think she's asleep yet? I'm on the
same side of the door as you are.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.309
Stop talking.
Cam.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.471
Lily lost
her first tooth today,

00:12.560 --> 00:15.200
and she's very excited about
a visit from the tooth fairy.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.112
When I had
my first loose tooth-

00:17.240 --> 00:19.960
my mama tied
one end of a string to it...

00:20.080 --> 00:21.833
and the other to the tail
of a Guernsey cow-

00:22.000 --> 00:23.760
fired
off a 12-gauge shotgun,

00:23.840 --> 00:26.280
and the cow went runnin' out of the room.
That never happened.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.676
Tell that to the cow-shaped hole
in my bedroom wall.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.320
Shh.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.279
- Gotcha!
- Oh!

00:39.360 --> 00:42.194
What are you doing here?
You're not the tooth fairy.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.318
N-No. But we just wanted
to see if she'd come yet.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.000
No. She sure is taking
her sweet time.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.278
Maybe you should just go back to sleep,
sweetie, 'cause it could take a while.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.240
I've got nowhere to be.

00:55.840 --> 00:56.588
♪ Hey, hey ♪

01:03.800 --> 01:05.200
♪ Hey♪ ♪

01:07.520 --> 01:10.877
Mom, I can't be late today. Sanjay
Patel and I are dissecting a pig.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.680
- So sad what passes for a date in your life.
- Haley.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.757
He keeps asking me to hand him
all of the instruments.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.320
He wants me to act
like a nurse.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.040
Now it sounds like
a date in Haley's life.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.879
Luke!
Okay, before you say no-

01:21.000 --> 01:22.434
No. You haven't
even seen it yet.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.592
Mmm, I'm sticking with "no."
It's for Luke's Career Day.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.115
I thought I'd offer the kids
a chance to put their face on my body.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.431
- Ew!
- Ew. I just heard it too.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.121
How come you guys
never had a career day?

01:31.160 --> 01:32.514
Cutbacks.
Nor'easter.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.071
Today I get to talk
about the love of my life.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.919
Residential real estate.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.952
He really doesn't hear it.
I wanna make Luke proud.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.759
I wanna be his hero
like my dad was...

01:42.840 --> 01:45.400
when he talked to my class
about running a grocery store.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.949
He came in with two price guns
in holsters...

01:48.040 --> 01:50.999
and marked our teacher at $1.29
before she knew what hit her.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.037
I bet that produced
a lot of laughs.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.231
Claire, please.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.950
And Olivia Berman's mom works in the
rare books department at the library.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.793
Hope I get a chance
to pick that brain.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.872
Looks like you got quite
the Career Day lineup.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.634
So I guess they already got
a closet guy coming in, huh?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.160
No. I didn't think
you'd wanna do it.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.755
I don't, but I just
feel bad for the kids.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.681
A lot of interesting stories
in the closet biz.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.473
Oh. Why have you never
told us any?

02:13.560 --> 02:17.270
Okay. Well, for example,
there was this guy.

02:17.400 --> 02:19.790
Must have had over 100 hats.
Yes?

02:19.880 --> 02:21.519
And we had to fit them
in the closet.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.432
Okay.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.557
And we did.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.433
All right. Maybe it's not the most exciting
career in the world, but it pays the bills.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.553
No one is complaining. Were there
other things I'd rather do? Yes.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.195
But I had to make ends meet.
What other things?

02:36.280 --> 02:37.760
I always wanted to write thrillers.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.712
Like that hat story?
Spy thrillers.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.280
I've been kicking around
this character,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.636
C.I.A. agent Chuck Stone,
who doesn't care...

02:43.720 --> 02:46.110
how much his antics
annoy the brass in Arlington.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.113
- Why didn't you ever try it?
- I was busy with work and family.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.953
I was gonna start writing
after my divorce,

02:51.040 --> 02:53.999
but, you know,
life got in the way.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.675
Why do you point at me
when you say "life"? Am I "life"?

02:56.800 --> 02:59.759
I meant you keep me busy. You
had a three-hour nap on Sunday.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.360
I was tired.
From what?

03:01.440 --> 03:04.000
Your two-hour nap
on Saturday?

03:04.120 --> 03:05.713
Jay, I've been with you
for five years,

03:05.800 --> 03:08.076
and I've never heard you mention
anything about writing.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.958
Hey, I bought a typewriter.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.157
A typewriter?

03:12.240 --> 03:14.471
When is your book signing?

03:14.560 --> 03:16.233
1975?

03:16.320 --> 03:17.834
It's a hell of a character.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.992
They taught him how to kill,
but he never learned to love.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.237
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.880
Daddies! Daddies!
The tooth fairy came.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.913
What? No way!
Oh, that's so exciting!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.959
- What'd she bring you?
- Well-

03:33.600 --> 03:35.034
Oh! Fairy dust.
Ah.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.634
Nice touch. My gosh, it's a lot.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.473
- Uh-huh.
- Some stickers.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.829
Oh!
Ah!

03:39.920 --> 03:43.311
- A toothbrush.
- Ooh!

03:43.400 --> 03:44.914
And a hundred dollar bill!

03:45.040 --> 03:47.271
What? Come on. Okay.
Wow! Look at that.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.919
I love the tooth fairy.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.635
The tooth fairy gave
our daughter $100.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.952
Does she not know that the going rate
for a tooth is five at the most?

03:55.040 --> 03:57.555
Well, obviously, the tooth
fairy made a mistake.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.871
Maybe it's 'cause the tooth fairy
had too much chardonnay last night.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.758
I think the tooth fairy
can handle the chardonnay.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.036
What I don't think she can
handle is criticizing someone...

04:04.120 --> 04:06.237
who made an honest mistake
in the dark of the night.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.118
I'm gonna put this
in my clutch.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.760
I can't wait to tell
everyone at school.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.352
Okay, we cannot be the parents
of a six-year-old...

04:14.480 --> 04:16.360
who gets a hundred dollars
from the tooth fairy.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.869
It's bad enough we're the parents
of a six-year-old with a clutch.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.158
You know, that bag transitions
from day to night seamlessly,

04:22.280 --> 04:24.431
and I no longer have to carry crayons
in my front pocket.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.193
Can't have this argument again!

04:26.280 --> 04:30.718
Thank you, Dr. Ann, for showing
us how exciting and surprising...

04:30.800 --> 04:33.190
a real live
therapy session can be.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.397

09:13.640 --> 09:15.597
You said you want to write.
Write.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.070
Now? I've got a busy day.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.431
I already called your office and
told them that you can't come in...

09:20.520 --> 09:24.673
to walk around for 20 minutes saying
to everyone, "What's up, sport?"

09:24.760 --> 09:27.760
I know this is your subtle little way
of saying you don't think I can do it.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.309
No. It's life
getting out of the way.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.393
Fine. I'm gonna take you up on your little
challenge, but you should know this:

09:33.480 --> 09:36.154
This behavior of yours is not gonna
fly when you lose your looks.

09:36.240 --> 09:37.754
Mmm!

09:37.840 --> 09:39.957
You're gonna be
long gone by then.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.513
Hey! Dunphy.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.478
Yeah? Oh.
You okay?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.798
I'm fine, fine. Don't let that little
smart-ass bother ya, all right?

09:52.880 --> 09:55.315
Have you seen her mother?
Does not age well.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.040
Well, um, thanks
for rescuing me in there.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.271
And tell Phil I'm sorry
if I threw him off in there.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.556
I probably should learn just
to keep my big blowhole shut.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.917
Actually, it went a little better than
it did in rehearsal, to be honest,

10:06.080 --> 10:08.276
but I will tell him what you said.
All right.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.238
Your little meltdown
in there got me thinking.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.471
I'm building
a retail office development,

10:12.560 --> 10:15.553
and I could use a liaison
to work with the planning commission.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.911
Are you offering me a job?
Well, yeah.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.913
You know people in city hall,
and you did a hell of a job on that flip.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.040
And for the safety of you and your family,
I gotta get you out of that house.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.959
But you and Phil are competitors.
It-Not on this.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.271
Look, if this works out,
everybody's gonna win,

10:29.440 --> 10:31.750
except for that tropical fish store
we're bootin' outta there. Mmm.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.600
I don't feel bad about that at all.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.200
Can I take a couple of days to
think about it? Yeah, yeah.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.596
Take your time. No pressure. And when
you're ready, just give me a call.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.234
Okay.
Number's on the stick.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.835
Great. Oh, yeah.
Okay. Gil pickle!

10:42.960 --> 10:45.873
See ya! Thorpe! Thorpe! Thorpe!
Thorpe. Thorpe. Thorpe.

10:48.640 --> 10:53.840
Look what just came in the mail.
A letter addressed to you, Lily.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.754
- Really? I don't get much mail.
- Let's see here.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.433
Uh, yeah.
Oh, the tooth fairy.

10:58.560 --> 11:03.999
1 Tooth Fairy Lane, Tooth
City, Tooth Dakota. Mm-hmm.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.912
I hope it's another
hundred dollars.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.276
Oh. Well, lookee there.
Glitter!

11:08.400 --> 11:10.915
I guess the tooth fairy
doesn't have to worry about vacuuming.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.553
"Dear Lily, I'm writing because I made a
mistake and gave you too much money."

11:16.640 --> 11:17.994
Oh.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.754
"Please leave the hundred dollars
under your pillow tonight,

11:20.840 --> 11:23.036
and I'll give you a dollar.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.351
Sorry if that bites." Oh.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.080
Let me see that.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.640
I can't read.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.792
Uh, well, it sounds like
she's really in a jam.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.000
And I think we're gonna have to give the
tooth fairy her hundred dollars back.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.680
- Mm-hmm.
- No! I wanna keep it.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.995
I'm scared that she's gonna be the one
taking care of us when we're older.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.036
Yeah.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.555
Chuck Stone,

11:47.640 --> 11:50.553
6 foot 3 inches
of steely-eyed determination,

11:50.640 --> 11:53.075
sat at the interrogation table.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.516
His mind was a blank.

11:55.600 --> 11:59.799
A complete blank.

11:59.880 --> 12:03.715
He literally could not think
of one single, solitary thing.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.235
Then he noticed a spot.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.950
It looked like syrup left
over from breakfast-

12:10.080 --> 12:11.799
Which made him realize
it was lunchtime.

12:11.880 --> 12:13.712
Bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwich-

12:13.800 --> 12:15.678
or B. L. T.,
as Chuck Stone called it-

12:15.760 --> 12:18.070
would really hit the spot.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.834
The secret, Chuck realized,
was real mayonnaise.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.600
Mmm. Not that healthy crap his
wife kept buying for their son.

12:23.720 --> 12:24.790
Damn it!

12:24.880 --> 12:28.112
I mean, what's the point
of t-t-t-t-t-t-t?

12:28.200 --> 12:31.079
"Tea for two. Two for tea."

12:31.160 --> 12:33.231
It only gets worse from here.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.996
You can't be serious.
Gil Thorpe is my nemesis!

12:37.080 --> 12:39.117
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not Batman.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.716
Trust me. Gil is a snake, and he's
found the perfect way to mess with me.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.714
Did it ever occur to you that he was
hiring me because of-I don't know-me?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.598
Are you kidding?
What's your last name?

12:48.680 --> 12:50.672
Right now?

12:50.760 --> 12:54.151
I'm sorry, Claire. I hate to do
this, but I have to use my veto.

12:54.240 --> 12:57.870
- Veto? Oh, you don't get any vetoes.
- You veto me all the time.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.316
- 'Cause you have dumb ideas.
- Name one.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.357
That went on for a while.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.558
And let's not forget
shower snacks.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.071
I can't be the only one
who gets hungry in there!

13:12.240 --> 13:15.631
Hey, Jay. My mom
said you were writing a book.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.598
That's fantastic.
Uh-huh.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.911
By the way, Career Day
was a little weird.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.799
I think Claire's going through some pretty
dark stuff, and you might want to check-

13:22.880 --> 13:24.951
Enough chitchat. I've gotta get
a character out of a bind.

13:25.040 --> 13:28.477
- Ooh. What did he do?
- He told his wife he could write a book.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.519
Don't give up, Jay. Self-doubt
is part of the process.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.399
You can't be a good writer without
being critical of your own work.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.957
Hmm. Huh.
What?

13:39.080 --> 13:42.357
I'm racking my brain for a compliment here.
I know. It stinks.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.314
And your mom's gonna rub it
in my face pretty good. Okay.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.517
Why is Chuck Stone
interrogating this guy?

13:47.600 --> 13:49.671
He needs the codes.
If he doesn't get 'em,

13:49.760 --> 13:52.798
the International Space Station's gonna
crash into Times Square on New Year's Eve.

13:52.880 --> 13:55.315
- So he's short of time.
- Got about two minutes. He's desperate.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.153
How about this?

13:57.240 --> 13:59.914
"Chuck Stone smiled
and lit a cigarette,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.071
as if he had
all the time in the world,

14:02.160 --> 14:04.675
when in fact,
the world was about to end."

14:04.760 --> 14:06.274
Holy crap. What happens next?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.589
Move over. I'll type.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.112
Some coffee would be great.
Thanks.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.117
I don't understand why
we don't just go in there,

14:23.200 --> 14:25.032
we tell her we're taking
the money, and that's that.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.551
Because this is a teaching moment, and we
want her to want to give the money back.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.281
I'm just really worried
we're becoming...

14:30.360 --> 14:32.920
those overindulgent parents right now.
Don't be silly.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.793
Okay, you ready, tooth fairy?

14:34.880 --> 14:37.395
- Let's do this.
- All right.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.233
Lily, look who came to say hi!

14:47.320 --> 14:50.279
It's me, the tooth fairy.

14:50.360 --> 14:53.512
And I've come to ask you
for a favor!

14:53.600 --> 14:55.956
Are you really the tooth fairy?

14:56.080 --> 14:58.549
Why, yes, I am.
Look at my wings!

14:58.640 --> 15:01.758
Can you fly?
I wanna see you fly.

15:01.920 --> 15:06.790
Well, I can't right now,
because-Um-Well, because-

15:06.920 --> 15:10.596
Because the tooth fairy's too
sad to fly-

15:10.720 --> 15:13.952
Because she made a mistake
that only you can make better.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.713
Is this about the money again?

15:15.800 --> 15:17.757
Well, yes, it is.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.754
I need enough for all
the other children's tooths.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.433
Teeth.
Wait a minute.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.399
You're not the tooth fairy.
You're Haley.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.278
No! I am the tooth fairy!

15:28.360 --> 15:29.919
Look! Fairy dust!

15:30.000 --> 15:31.753
There's that glitter.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.275
Why did you lie?
You said lying was wrong.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.912
We also said that when someone
is in trouble, you help them.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.599
How do I know
you weren't lying?

15:40.680 --> 15:43.115
She is good. All right,
Lily, this is ridiculous.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.317
All right, the tooth fairy
has made a mistake.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.472
You need to put the $100 under the pillow,
and that is the end of the story.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.752
Because you believe it's the right
thing to do, don't you? Yes.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.071
But I wanna buy a scooter.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.231
That's what I'd do.

15:56.320 --> 16:00.917
I mean, who cares
what Santa thinks, right?

16:01.040 --> 16:04.078
Santa? Well, he sees everything,

16:04.160 --> 16:06.516
and this will probably
put you on the "naughty" list.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.513
But who needs presents
every year?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.990
You've got a hundred dollars.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.198
You can ride around that empty Christmas
tree until you're an old lady.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.920
Can I have some time
to think about it?

16:18.080 --> 16:19.799
You don't need any-
Of course, sweetie.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.870
Yeah. Okay.

16:24.240 --> 16:26.038
Haley?
Okay, that was brilliant.

16:26.120 --> 16:28.271
Thanks.
Oh, also, can I borrow this?

16:28.360 --> 16:30.397
- Why?
- I'd rather not say.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.552
You know,
after I put on the wig,

16:33.680 --> 16:35.797
I just-I felt
like the character.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.400
Hang on.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.671
Yello? Quick question.
Am I talking to live Phil...

16:39.760 --> 16:41.592
or video Phil?

16:41.720 --> 16:45.080
What do you want, Gil? I just wanna make
sure it's okay that your wife calls me boss.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.197
Good-bye.
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.796
I'm just messing with ya. Although I do think
your wife's gonna enjoy being under me.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.277
My son is in the car.
Hey, superstar! What's up?

16:54.360 --> 16:57.114
Listen, any time you wanna swing by the
beach house, I'll be glad to show ya...

16:57.200 --> 17:00.477
how to throw a tight spiral like
I did at Texas Tech-booyah!

17:00.560 --> 17:02.517
Tommy! He already
knows how to throw.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.075
Yeah, my gay uncle Cam taught me.
I got this.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.391
This was between us.
You don't bring family into it.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.278
Low blow getting
Claire's hopes up.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.876
Hey, I'm not getting her hopes up.
This is a real job with real bennies.

17:12.960 --> 17:15.520
One of which is I get to
tell you what I'm thinking...

17:15.599 --> 17:17.193
whenever she leans over
my desk!

17:18.920 --> 17:21.388
Oh, I'm gonna have
so much fun with this! Uh!

17:21.480 --> 17:23.199
Later, Dunphbags!

17:23.319 --> 17:25.039
What a jerk.
You know what?

17:25.119 --> 17:27.237
We're gonna tell your mom before she
goes into business with this guy-

17:27.319 --> 17:30.358
He's Gilty of being
a Thorpe in my side.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.154
Trying too hard.
Yeah.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.193
- Hello!

17:36.280 --> 17:37.999
Move!
Ow!

17:38.080 --> 17:39.878
You're fine.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.474
So?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.716
How was your first day
of writing?

17:44.800 --> 17:46.632
Gloria, shh!
Let me finish one thought.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.674
Got it.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.240
So you actually
wrote something?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.313
It was slow going at first, but
then the juices started flowing.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.877
May I? Sure. Uh, if it
helps, picture Tom Berenger.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.474
I always do.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.074
What?

18:05.160 --> 18:08.756
It's just this-This first
sentence is a bit long.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.559
Long or dynamic?

18:10.640 --> 18:13.633
No, long and confusing.
I can't tell who's talking.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.110
Maybe that's just to mimic
the fog of battle.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.550
Oh, okay.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.200
- Hmph.
- What now?

18:21.280 --> 18:24.830
Just that... there were
no cell phones in 1965.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.241
That's a mistake. I'm changing that.
You can't change that.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.351
It comes back in the end-
I-I presume.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.113
The point is, I can write.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.999
I probably won't pursue it,
but it's a viable career option.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.312
The C.I.A. had all sorts
of top secret technology.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.959
Who's to say
they didn't have cell phones?

18:39.040 --> 18:40.474
Manny, let it go.

18:40.560 --> 18:44.713
And this Chuck Stone-He doesn't
seem very good at his job.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.269
He's flawed. That's what makes
the character interesting.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.670
If you want someone perfect,
put in a robot.

18:49.760 --> 18:53.151
A robot!
I like a robot.

18:53.240 --> 18:57.234
No! You're not putting a robot
in my story. That's right-my story.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.591
You must be very happy.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.356
I would be, but life got in the way.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.916
- What are you doing?
- I just got out my old briefcase.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.232
It's still capable of doing
the job, just like me.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.921
Claire, you have to
understand something.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.440
You have
to understand something.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.479
I walked around all day on cloud
nine because somebody valued me.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.836
I value you.
We all value you.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.400
I know.
Of course you do,

19:25.480 --> 19:27.995
because I cook and I clean
and I pick up dirty underwear.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.560
No, honey,
it's different than that.

19:29.640 --> 19:31.871
I have been on the sidelines
for so long,

19:31.960 --> 19:35.032
I didn't know if anybody would ever
think I have what it takes again.

19:35.120 --> 19:38.796
I know. Gil's not the greatest
guy, but this is important.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.315
- And I think-
- I think you should take the job.

19:41.440 --> 19:44.877
But, Dad-No, Luke. She's right.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.758
Your mom's gonna be
amazing at this.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.110
Mmm!

19:51.200 --> 19:53.271
- I retract my veto.
- You never had a veto.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.440
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't, and I'll tell you why.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.154
And that went on for a while.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.439
- Lastly, this whole conversation would be happening in a yurt.
- It's the perfect structure.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.989
I have to go take the shoulder
pads out of all my old suits.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.079
You know he's gonna
keep teasing you.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.629
If it makes your mom happy,
I can handle a few phone calls.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.237
And texts. Wow!

20:15.400 --> 20:18.359
What does it say? Nothing I can't handle.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.910
"We all weave a web of lies.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.039
Some we tell to try
to help the ones we love.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.277
Some we tell to try
to fool ourselves.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.073
And some we tell because,

20:38.160 --> 20:41.949
when you're out of bullets and staring
down the barrel of a Kalashnikov,

20:42.040 --> 20:44.874
the only weapon
you've got left is guile."

20:45.000 --> 20:48.835
She's nuts. That's fantastic.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.798
Okay, guys, bring it in!

20:53.880 --> 20:55.792
Let's get this place shipshape
before she gets home.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.032
I'm sure she had a big first day.
Haley, I'm putting you on laundry.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.715
Alex, kitchen and vacuum.
Luke, you're cleaning the bathroom.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.951
- Why me?
- Because you always mess it up.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.918
Yeah, why can't you
pee straight?

21:06.040 --> 21:08.760
Hey, I'm doing a great job from
that far back. Okay, guys.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.354
Team Dunphy on three.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.274
One, two-That's right.
We got a lot to do!

21:14.480 --> 21:16.278
Honey, what are you
doing home so early?

21:16.360 --> 21:18.556
I quit. That man is a complete pig.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.599
He treated me like a servant and
showed me absolutely no respect.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.433
I'm so sorry.
You deserve better than that.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.716
I do. Oh!

21:25.800 --> 21:27.951
So what's for dinner?

21:28.040 --> 21:30.400
I feel like you heard me wrong.
I said, "What's for dinner?"

21:30.480 --> 21:31.470
I heard you!
