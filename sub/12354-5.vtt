WEBVTT

00:08.135 --> 00:11.103
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:11.103 --> 00:12.686
My name is
Julianne Hofschraeger.

00:12.687 --> 00:14.237
You know that we're
hemorrhaging business

00:14.305 --> 00:16.271
with the big guys
leaving, right?

00:16.389 --> 00:18.156
You're the new Jesus Christ
and I am counting on you

00:18.223 --> 00:20.024
to close like a motherfucker.

00:20.025 --> 00:22.108
But trust me, I'm not here
to outshine you.

00:22.175 --> 00:23.926
'Cause I'm the goddamn sun.

00:24.059 --> 00:25.742
I fucked my boss,
told the whole company.

00:25.843 --> 00:27.044
Left my handsome, rich

00:27.060 --> 00:29.311
fiancÃ© and got kicked out of our
stunning downtown loft.

00:29.478 --> 00:32.029
You put together six months
of sobriety...

00:32.095 --> 00:33.681
and I'll vanish.

00:33.814 --> 00:36.598
You're, like, the fucking
morality Nazi or something.

00:36.664 --> 00:38.265
Are you taking
Parkinson's drugs?

00:38.331 --> 00:39.565
Do the math.

00:39.649 --> 00:41.082
Night, Daddy.
Night, Mom.

00:41.149 --> 00:43.801
Is this some sort
of a legal custody grab?

00:43.935 --> 00:45.067
He's already here, Marty.

00:46.068 --> 00:48.003
(people chanting)

00:51.771 --> 00:53.071
Get my man right there.

00:53.138 --> 00:55.656
One percent took
my pants, yo.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.323
Pants?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.191
They're taking our jobs.

00:59.257 --> 01:01.392
Busting up our unions.

01:01.459 --> 01:03.059
He used to have
a pot to piss in.

01:03.126 --> 01:05.427
Corporate warmongers
took that shit, too.

01:05.494 --> 01:06.827
(crowd clamoring in agreement)

01:06.894 --> 01:08.261
See, it's real simple.

01:08.328 --> 01:10.896
I'm about getting brown folks
to see that our money

01:10.963 --> 01:12.763
is tied up in Wall Street, too.

01:12.830 --> 01:14.965
And I ain't stopping
until we get some

01:15.031 --> 01:16.865
economic equality
up in this bitch!

01:16.931 --> 01:18.466
Right, that's right.

01:18.532 --> 01:20.467
I'm a fighter.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.667
Guess I got that from my pops.

01:25.969 --> 01:28.120
JEREMIAH:
Empowering the disenfranchised.

01:28.186 --> 01:29.353
Mm.

01:29.421 --> 01:30.854
It's a powerful drug,
isn't it, son?

01:30.921 --> 01:32.121
Oh, yeah.
Mm.

01:32.173 --> 01:33.222
Yeah, anybody ever
tell you that, uh,

01:33.289 --> 01:35.290
double-dipping bread
is unsanitary?

01:35.457 --> 01:37.475
This bread is
why I invited y'all here.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.776
I've been jonesing
for it since my last visit.

01:39.842 --> 01:41.609
Last visit, what was it,
like, three years ago?

01:41.610 --> 01:42.275
It hasn't been
that long.

01:42.427 --> 01:43.860
Well, I was
into Soulja Boy,

01:43.927 --> 01:45.795
so, yeah, it's been forevs.

01:45.796 --> 01:46.712
My bad, little man.

01:46.779 --> 01:47.713
But I'm back.

01:47.779 --> 01:49.947
Hey, hey, oh, oh.
Hey.

01:50.014 --> 01:51.715
(Malcolm laughing)

01:51.781 --> 01:53.182
You got a very strong community

01:53.248 --> 01:54.415
of supporters
on that Twitter.

01:54.481 --> 01:56.016
ROSCOE:
They're his "tweeple," Grandpa.

01:56.099 --> 01:56.815
They're his what?

01:56.967 --> 01:58.567
His "tweeple."
Yeah, his "tweeple."

01:58.633 --> 01:59.800
I've been, uh,

01:59.867 --> 02:01.534
I've been talking to Cornel.

02:01.601 --> 02:03.469
(laughs) West?

02:03.535 --> 02:05.870
So, Cornel West knows you?

02:06.021 --> 02:07.021
Yeah. (clears throat)

02:07.087 --> 02:09.122
He retweeted me one time
and I retweeted him.

02:09.187 --> 02:10.555
There is dialogue.

02:10.622 --> 02:12.490
I think it's pretty fierce
that you've been living

02:12.556 --> 02:14.757
in a tent community--
hit me up next time.

02:14.775 --> 02:16.224
I got you.
See, Pops, he's already on...

02:16.291 --> 02:17.358
He's ready for the movement!

02:17.425 --> 02:18.692
It's in the blood,
it's in the blood.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.594
There's no chance in hell

02:20.661 --> 02:21.627
you're gonna be staying in some

02:21.694 --> 02:23.895
rat-infested candy shop
for pedophiles.

02:23.962 --> 02:25.529
So forget about it.
Shit, there's more

02:25.596 --> 02:27.163
sharks in your tank
than mine, Squirrel.

02:27.229 --> 02:28.697
Please don't call me that.

02:28.764 --> 02:30.565
What was that nickname--
Squirrel?

02:30.631 --> 02:32.165
'Cause your daddy was always
trying to get a nut.

02:32.231 --> 02:34.299
I'm stealing that, yo.
I think

02:34.366 --> 02:35.583
that's a bad idea, yo.

02:35.649 --> 02:37.284
So, uh,

02:37.368 --> 02:39.168
you running Galweather?

02:39.235 --> 02:41.002
I mean,

02:41.069 --> 02:43.871
all that tap-dancing, you got
to be the man by now.

02:43.937 --> 02:46.171
Wow, all up in
my nut sack again.

02:46.238 --> 02:47.739
The way you hoard that shit,

02:47.805 --> 02:49.489
ain't no way.
Why are you so concerned about my career?

02:49.555 --> 02:50.856
I'm just telling it like it is.

02:50.924 --> 02:52.057
(arguing indistinctly)

02:52.124 --> 02:53.324
Marty? Malcolm?

02:53.390 --> 02:55.291
Huh?

02:57.126 --> 02:58.510
Okay?

03:01.595 --> 03:02.795
You okay, Pop?

03:02.879 --> 03:04.379
Hmm?

03:04.446 --> 03:06.614
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

03:06.631 --> 03:07.847
Got my three men here.

03:07.914 --> 03:09.965
Everything is good, hmm?

03:15.751 --> 03:17.419
(Malcolm sighs)

03:20.637 --> 03:21.803
(sighs)

03:21.870 --> 03:23.437
Give it here.

03:23.504 --> 03:24.671
Come on.

03:24.722 --> 03:25.838
You sure, Dad?
I'm sure.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.173
'Cause I could...
You know... I know, next time.

03:28.240 --> 03:29.407
Thanks.

03:29.474 --> 03:30.807
Thanks for the invite, Malcolm.

03:30.891 --> 03:32.959
Well, if big-money
Squirrel is paying,

03:33.142 --> 03:34.760
I'm getting me
some pot de creme.

03:34.893 --> 03:38.545
Add pot de creme
to that to-go order.

03:38.610 --> 03:42.080
JEANNIE: <i>I just really don't see</i>
<i>why we have to actually do it.</i>

03:42.080 --> 03:45.131
Well, if we are going to give
Cupid Chemistry a real gut

03:45.197 --> 03:47.131
on how to expand
into niche markets

03:47.265 --> 03:50.400
for their online dating
Web site, using this matching

03:50.433 --> 03:51.582
algorithm, then we're gonna...

03:51.649 --> 03:52.716
Doug?

03:52.734 --> 03:54.051
Hmm?
New rule.

03:54.185 --> 03:56.368
You don't have to raise your
hand if you need to go tinkle.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.153
I want to ask you something--
is my index finger

03:58.187 --> 03:59.803
shorter than my ring finger,

03:59.937 --> 04:00.937
or the same length?

04:01.003 --> 04:02.488
ALL: Shorter.

04:02.571 --> 04:03.638
God, they are thorough,
I'll give them that.

04:03.823 --> 04:05.706
Yeah, you know why they ask
the question about

04:05.772 --> 04:06.772
the index finger, Doug?
Mm-hmm?

04:06.839 --> 04:08.407
Because a man's index finger

04:08.441 --> 04:10.308
is directly proportional
to the size of his...

04:10.575 --> 04:12.359
No.
100% accurate.

04:12.576 --> 04:14.260
(laughing):
Obviously it's not... no.

04:14.327 --> 04:16.094
Why do I suddenly want
to fuck Arsenio Hall?

04:16.195 --> 04:17.361
(laughs)
Please.

04:17.411 --> 04:18.761
I will put my finger
against Arsenio's dick

04:18.829 --> 04:20.228
any day of the week.

04:20.230 --> 04:20.978
Aw...
Wow.

04:21.029 --> 04:22.897
whoops.
Kiddies,

04:22.898 --> 04:24.531
Daddy's done.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.265
How are you done?
Not possible.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.034
There's like 500
fucking million questions

04:29.200 --> 04:30.249
on this idiotic
dating profile.

04:30.317 --> 04:31.250
MARTY: Yes,

04:31.451 --> 04:32.667
and I answered all of them

04:32.734 --> 04:36.603
with the careless abandon
of not giving a shit.

04:36.603 --> 04:37.720
Good job, Daddy.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.854
The Cupid Chemistry CEO
was kind enough to give us

04:39.921 --> 04:41.421
three weeks of membership
for free.

04:41.488 --> 04:43.189
I think it behooves all of us

04:43.190 --> 04:44.388
to give a shit.

04:44.507 --> 04:46.007
When you say all of us,
who do you...?

04:46.074 --> 04:48.142
Well, obviously not you,
Marty, I mean... Boo.

04:48.209 --> 04:50.043
Fuck me.
Come on. Shit.

04:50.210 --> 04:53.829
So, U.S. National Bank has
requested a sit-down with a team

04:53.893 --> 04:56.695
headed specifically by you.
Ah.

04:56.762 --> 04:59.430
Seems that you have made
quite a name for yourself.

04:59.496 --> 05:02.064
Oh, thank you.
Well, I'm all over it.

05:02.130 --> 05:05.166
And I think I'm gonna have one
of my new hires join you there.

05:05.231 --> 05:07.900
You, uh, worked with Tamara
in Vegas, right? No...

05:07.967 --> 05:09.968
Uh, yes, but if it's
all the same to you,

05:10.033 --> 05:11.901
I'd just rather take somebody
from my own team.

05:11.968 --> 05:13.101
Oh, yeah, sure, your call.

05:13.169 --> 05:15.070
I mean, I don't have
to tell you how valued

05:15.136 --> 05:16.437
you are here at Galweather.

05:16.504 --> 05:17.871
You are one of our stars.

05:17.971 --> 05:19.705
Translation--

05:19.806 --> 05:21.439
Galweather is sinking
and you need

05:21.640 --> 05:24.174
a new bank to make up
for the loss of Metrocapital.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.940
You can just talk to me
like a professional,

05:26.108 --> 05:27.892
Julianne-- you don't have
to tickle the balls.

05:29.309 --> 05:30.677
You're right.

05:30.694 --> 05:31.877
Neither of us has the time

05:31.944 --> 05:33.243
so I'm gonna get to it.

05:33.361 --> 05:36.496
Here is what I need
from the great Marty Kaan.

05:36.562 --> 05:39.597
Go to Chicago,
bat your eyes, French kiss

05:39.698 --> 05:41.949
some ass if that's what
it takes to bring

05:42.015 --> 05:43.415
this home for Galweather.

05:43.483 --> 05:45.367
Hope that didn't tickle.

05:47.118 --> 05:49.668
Clyde, you used the word
"cock" in every answer?

05:49.668 --> 05:51.786
That is not true.
"Clyde is more enthusiastic

05:51.853 --> 05:54.220
than most people about
his big cock." Big ol' cock.

05:54.370 --> 05:56.921
Sure, yeah, true.
"Clyde likes to work out in the mornings

05:56.922 --> 05:58.439
with his big cock."
With his big ol' cock, yeah.

05:58.505 --> 06:00.573
Maybe you and your big cock
should run off to Vermont

06:00.640 --> 06:02.240
and get married.
Oh, I wish.

06:02.306 --> 06:03.807
But we're just
not that compatible.

06:03.874 --> 06:06.442
Sometimes he likes fat chicks.

06:06.443 --> 06:07.877
Fam-a-lam, we are splitting up.

06:07.943 --> 06:09.744
One of you is coming
to Chi-town with me.

06:09.878 --> 06:12.629
Thank God-- see you
later, freak and geek.

06:12.795 --> 06:14.579
Uh, no, Jeannie.

06:14.580 --> 06:15.863
I'm taking Clyde.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.029
You and Doug are going
to San Diego.

06:17.031 --> 06:18.548
To take
on Cupid Chemistry.

06:18.631 --> 06:19.698
Oh.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.249
Okay, sure.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.250
DOUG:
San Diego?

06:25.417 --> 06:26.467
Doug Guggenheim calling.

06:26.534 --> 06:28.602
Prepare to be painted red.
(laughs)

06:29.969 --> 06:32.871
I'm feeling
something very real,

06:32.938 --> 06:35.639
very scary forming
between the two of us.

06:35.705 --> 06:37.906
Insert Clyde dick joke here.

06:37.973 --> 06:39.473
No, no, no, no.

06:39.540 --> 06:40.841
For real.

06:40.907 --> 06:42.674
Thank you for letting
me second this one.

06:45.843 --> 06:48.044
Jeannie is fucking
pissed though.

06:48.177 --> 06:49.377
(laughs)
Well,

06:49.445 --> 06:51.379
look, I can't play favorites,
you're both my kids.

06:51.379 --> 06:53.813
Aw, shucks, Dad.

06:53.879 --> 06:55.580
I've been waiting my whole life
to hear you say that.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.014
(laughs)

06:57.080 --> 06:58.882
(clears throat)

06:58.899 --> 07:01.166
Did you not bring her
because she was bad in bed?

07:01.183 --> 07:02.833
There he is.

07:02.984 --> 07:04.150
(laughs)

07:04.217 --> 07:06.686
Can't help it, can you?

07:06.752 --> 07:08.520
Seriously though.

07:08.587 --> 07:10.120
Thank you.

07:10.187 --> 07:11.821
I needed some extra
shine at the office.

07:13.755 --> 07:16.140
You work your ass off for these
motherfuckers and then...

07:16.239 --> 07:20.258
poof, vaginas are the new dicks
at Galweather.

07:20.324 --> 07:22.025
PILOT (over speaker):
Sit back, relax,

07:22.192 --> 07:23.392
enjoy the rest of the flight.

07:23.458 --> 07:24.775
We'll begin to descend
in about 15 minutes.

INSTRUCTOR (on TV):
To the right, to the left,

07:35.131 --> 07:36.532
to the right, to the left.
One, two, three.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.849
Mr. Criswell, the team
from Galweather is...

07:38.867 --> 07:40.600
Oh, hey, hold on one sec.

07:40.667 --> 07:42.134
So glad you guys could make it.

07:42.201 --> 07:43.968
To the left.
I know you're tired...

07:44.035 --> 07:45.152
Cool down's
coming up.

07:45.286 --> 07:46.418
And we are done.
(yells)

07:46.452 --> 07:48.169
Yeah!

07:48.204 --> 07:49.554
WOMAN:
Good job, good job.

07:49.621 --> 07:51.322
You got to take care
of the temple.

07:51.506 --> 07:52.555
You must.
You got it, buddy, you got it.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.605
(yelling)

07:57.591 --> 07:59.324
Good, okay.

07:59.391 --> 08:00.992
Carl, this is Marty Kaan.

08:01.092 --> 08:02.342
And?

08:02.427 --> 08:03.560
Clyde Oberholt.
Right.

08:03.561 --> 08:04.226
They're the team
from Galweather.

08:04.377 --> 08:05.577
Ah, my Galweather guys.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.746
Ow.
Thought you saw it coming.

08:08.846 --> 08:10.463
Sorry about that.
You work out, right?

08:10.680 --> 08:11.730
Uh, yes, I do.

08:11.931 --> 08:13.781
Yeah, what do you do?
I box.

08:13.932 --> 08:15.048
You look really, really good.

08:15.215 --> 08:17.600
Uh, thank you.

08:17.666 --> 08:19.316
I'm sure you've

08:19.317 --> 08:21.067
gotten a whiff
of the HSBC shit explosion?

08:21.135 --> 08:23.002
Uh, yes.

08:23.019 --> 08:25.303
Um, terrorist ties.
Yeah.

08:25.370 --> 08:26.736
Money laundering using,

08:26.854 --> 08:27.953
It's an outrage.
uh, U.S. bank accounts?

08:28.020 --> 08:29.421
Yeah, in a climate
where people already

08:29.488 --> 08:30.621
distrust the banking industry.

08:30.689 --> 08:32.456
My nana keeps her money
in her bra.

08:32.523 --> 08:34.057
Calls it God's pocket.

08:34.191 --> 08:34.990
(laughs)

08:35.140 --> 08:36.407
Mr. Criswell

08:36.525 --> 08:37.957
has worked very hard
at making U.S. National

08:38.025 --> 08:39.559
a different kind of bank.

08:39.626 --> 08:41.159
A bank you can trust.

08:41.227 --> 08:42.159
Family bank.

08:42.227 --> 08:44.126
(sighs)
A bank

08:44.227 --> 08:45.962
where every Jane
and John Smith,

08:46.062 --> 08:47.863
Hernandez, Jackson,

08:47.897 --> 08:49.146
hell, even Chang

08:49.197 --> 08:51.014
can come with their kids
on a Saturday

08:51.015 --> 08:52.381
and count the pennies
in their piggy banks.

08:52.448 --> 08:53.264
Sounds lovely.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.633
You open an account with us,

08:55.650 --> 08:58.969
not because you get a
cherry pie, which you do,

08:58.985 --> 09:01.552
but because
you trust us.

09:01.552 --> 09:02.669
Trust and pie.

09:02.737 --> 09:03.720
That's American,

09:03.786 --> 09:04.987
and that's where you come in.

09:05.120 --> 09:06.170
Oh, to be an American?

09:06.238 --> 09:07.371
Oh, nuts.

09:07.539 --> 09:09.722
Nuts.
I, uh, I forgot

09:09.723 --> 09:10.573
my, uh, birth sac-tificate.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.707
Certificate.
Certificate, at home.

09:12.908 --> 09:15.025
(laughs)
This guy.

09:15.042 --> 09:16.025
I got it.
Get it?

09:16.092 --> 09:17.392
Obama joke. Yes.
Yeah.

09:17.459 --> 09:19.259
'Cause he's black, it's
an Obama joke, sure.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.194
Yeah, it's good.
Right. Well, we would like you

09:21.260 --> 09:23.395
to perform a regression analysis
of our client base,

09:23.495 --> 09:25.363
account security
and lending practices.

09:25.463 --> 09:28.448
USNB takes its fiduciary
integrity very seriously.

09:28.514 --> 09:30.181
Well, of course.

09:30.182 --> 09:32.732
And we'll be working with
your compliance team? No.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.684
Uh, they have already done
their analysis,

09:34.751 --> 09:36.852
and you will be fresh eyes.

09:37.051 --> 09:38.184
Okay.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.935
Get you guys set up. All right.
Yep.

09:40.003 --> 09:41.236
And, Brynn?

09:41.303 --> 09:44.138
Yeah?
Do me a favor.

09:44.204 --> 09:46.805
Give these guys some cherry pie.

09:47.806 --> 09:49.940
Fresh eyes?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.573
That is a little bit...
Weird.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.275
Weird is right.
Yeah.

09:53.341 --> 09:55.276
Plus Criswell is a little
rah-rah-sis-boom-bah

09:55.342 --> 09:56.509
about America.

09:56.575 --> 09:58.510
Doth I smell
a run for office?

09:58.576 --> 09:59.743
I think thou dost.
Ah.

09:59.812 --> 10:01.578
Uh, excuse me, Brynn?
Yeah?

10:01.645 --> 10:05.215
What office is it
that your boy's gunning for?

10:05.215 --> 10:06.981
What?
Come on.

10:07.015 --> 10:09.332
We can smell a political
consultant a mile off.

10:09.399 --> 10:11.833
Did I walk past a mirror?

10:11.900 --> 10:13.734
You did. No reflection.

10:13.768 --> 10:15.051
(chuckles)
Damn it.

10:17.118 --> 10:19.520
He wants to be governor
next go-around.

10:19.686 --> 10:22.371
Governor?
Well, his congressman daddy wants him to be governor.

10:22.438 --> 10:24.122
He hasn't officially announced
an intention.

10:24.322 --> 10:26.523
This is just
the strategy phase,

10:26.689 --> 10:28.273
but I'm the lucky girl
that gets to eat,

10:28.340 --> 10:29.808
sleep, and breathe
his political future.

10:29.825 --> 10:32.843
So you're like a sexy Geppetto
in Manolos?

10:34.693 --> 10:37.094
Right now, he's just another
fantastically rich white guy

10:37.161 --> 10:39.329
with an unapologetic God complex

10:39.395 --> 10:40.995
and an electable head
of hair plugs.

10:41.079 --> 10:42.479
(chuckles)

10:42.547 --> 10:45.115
Well, don't be so cynical
about rich white guys.

10:45.181 --> 10:46.281
They're making a comeback.

10:46.348 --> 10:47.748
Oh, you give me four years.

10:47.816 --> 10:48.983
He'll be fucking Braveheart.

10:49.050 --> 10:50.750
Ooh, with the face
paint and everything?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.184
Mm-hmm.

10:52.201 --> 10:54.835
It's weird
that he took Clyde, right?

10:54.902 --> 10:57.604
Did you see the way
Clyde smirked at me?

10:57.669 --> 11:00.738
Are you kidding me?

11:00.804 --> 11:02.271
What?

11:02.272 --> 11:03.689
Doug, your dating
profile pic.

11:03.756 --> 11:04.990
What?

11:04.991 --> 11:06.323
"Thank the Second Amendment..."

11:06.324 --> 11:08.124
BOTH: "For these guns, ladies."
Yeah.

11:08.258 --> 11:10.826
No.
What? I'm... That's...

11:10.827 --> 11:13.193
What? That just says that
I'm fit and that I'm pro-NRA.

11:13.260 --> 11:14.593
Big deal.

11:14.628 --> 11:15.944
That's not what it says, Doug.

11:16.045 --> 11:18.213
(tablet dings)
My God. Jeannie, look.

11:18.379 --> 11:19.829
I have a 94% match

11:20.014 --> 11:22.531
with, uh,
Shy Sarah from San Diego.

11:22.531 --> 11:23.747
Oh, my God.
Should I...

11:23.814 --> 11:25.081
Should I ask her out?

11:25.149 --> 11:27.033
Hmm, Shy Sarah did not

11:27.182 --> 11:28.649
post a profile pic.

11:28.651 --> 11:30.101
Meh.
Do you know what that means?

11:30.168 --> 11:32.018
She's shy because she's fugly.

11:32.185 --> 11:33.185
Please don't say that.

11:33.252 --> 11:34.752
This could be my soul mate,
Jeannie.

11:34.936 --> 11:37.887
It means that you could forever
be known as Doug and Fug.

11:38.104 --> 11:39.337
And how do you know that?

11:39.522 --> 11:42.540
Because I will start it,
and obviously it will catch on.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.707
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.) Oh, God, 94%.

11:44.858 --> 11:46.708
That's high; I'm gonna
ask her out. I have to,

11:46.774 --> 11:48.942
and I think you should ask out
one of your matches.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.509
(scoffs) When the
fuck did I become you?

11:50.575 --> 11:51.909
(tablet dings)

11:51.911 --> 11:53.094
Look at this one.
This one's great.

11:53.228 --> 11:55.012
Cameron the kung fu lover.

11:55.013 --> 11:56.278
Are you logged on to my profile?
Well, yeah.

11:56.446 --> 11:57.562
I'm trying to help you, Jeannie.

11:57.729 --> 11:58.479
I'm not going out

11:58.546 --> 12:00.814
with some Internet loser.
Fine.

12:00.815 --> 12:03.016
Well, I did not want to have
to do this, Jeannie, but...

12:03.032 --> 12:04.248
you leave me
with no choice.

12:04.316 --> 12:05.683
All right, some...

12:05.700 --> 12:07.417
tough love.

12:07.484 --> 12:08.884
Here, this is you.

12:08.885 --> 12:11.019
Excuse me, bigger boobs,

12:11.202 --> 12:12.285
but patties, not links.

12:12.319 --> 12:16.505
Okay, well,
one is a little bigger

12:16.705 --> 12:17.905
than the other.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.406
I'm a stickler for
detail, all right?

12:19.539 --> 12:20.722
All right, fine, here.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.874
Okay, so this is you, right?

12:23.958 --> 12:25.342
And this your life,
and it's clear to me

12:25.408 --> 12:26.408
that your journey line

12:26.459 --> 12:28.042
has a pattern.

12:28.126 --> 12:29.776
All right,
so every relationship

12:29.910 --> 12:31.043
in your life has an endgame.

12:31.111 --> 12:32.294
So a society marriage

12:32.495 --> 12:33.978
with Wes,

12:33.996 --> 12:35.596
a promotion from the Rainmaker,

12:35.663 --> 12:37.414
uh, being Marty's go-to gal.

12:37.547 --> 12:40.131
Okay, and there
you are right there

12:40.331 --> 12:41.747
at the tippy-top, yeah?
Little miss control freak

12:41.815 --> 12:42.982
with, okay, yeah,
amazing patty tits.

12:43.083 --> 12:44.283
Thank you.

12:44.450 --> 12:46.000
And the data presents
a very clear result.

12:46.167 --> 12:49.002
That if you can't
control the outcome,

12:49.135 --> 12:50.752
then Mama ain't in it to win it,

12:50.818 --> 12:51.919
and yeah, guess what, Jeannie?

12:52.087 --> 12:54.070
You're Mama.
So come on,

12:54.305 --> 12:56.305
one date.

12:56.371 --> 12:58.506
One tiny little date, Mama.

13:01.341 --> 13:04.209
CLYDE:
Criswell's laying it on thick for new customers.

13:04.275 --> 13:05.876
MARTY:
Hey, they're future voters, right?

13:05.942 --> 13:07.777
Would you like
to have some pie?

13:07.843 --> 13:08.943
Welcome.

13:09.010 --> 13:11.611
Oh, man.

13:11.679 --> 13:13.379
This pie is so delicious.

13:13.445 --> 13:15.981
I'm trying not to eat it
too fast, take my time with it.

13:16.047 --> 13:18.915
Be careful.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.766
Mr. Oberholt,
do you know how many men--

13:20.833 --> 13:22.566
well, boys really,

13:22.633 --> 13:24.601
most of them with massive
emotional insecurities...

13:24.602 --> 13:26.252
How about physical?

13:26.401 --> 13:27.484
Oh, physical.

13:27.686 --> 13:30.304
Really? Do you know how many
of them have made the mistake

13:30.437 --> 13:31.636
of trying to analogize

13:31.704 --> 13:33.571
U.S. National's cherry pies
to my vagina?

13:33.604 --> 13:36.289
Brynn, I wasn't talking
about your pie.

13:36.490 --> 13:38.123
No? Sure?
No.

13:38.124 --> 13:40.308
I wouldn't do that;
I'm not a child, okay?

13:40.325 --> 13:42.308
Okay.
Yes, I was.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.476
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I was talking about her pie.

13:44.609 --> 13:45.742
MARTY:
Hey, Brynn? Yeah?

13:45.777 --> 13:47.394
What's the occasion?

13:47.411 --> 13:48.828
Criswell is announcing
his program

13:48.895 --> 13:51.163
to put vegetable gardens
in inner-city schools.

13:51.229 --> 13:52.462
Aw.
Isn't he dreamy?

13:52.529 --> 13:53.963
Yeah, he sure will be

13:54.030 --> 13:55.864
when his base does
a Google search in three years

13:55.931 --> 13:57.464
and finds this little
piece of gold.

13:57.582 --> 13:59.816
Politics isn't theater;
it's performance art.

13:59.817 --> 14:01.217
Yeah.

14:01.283 --> 14:02.550
So your work,

14:02.751 --> 14:04.050
how you guys doing?

14:04.118 --> 14:05.485
We're doing good.

14:05.552 --> 14:06.885
Uh, the financials
look strong.

14:06.952 --> 14:09.488
Compliance team's analysis
is actually on point.

14:09.504 --> 14:10.821
No fires in the
financial statements

14:10.888 --> 14:12.088
or the operating reports.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.589
So if you're asking
us how we're doing,

14:13.656 --> 14:14.756
we're actually
doing pretty great.

14:14.823 --> 14:16.657
Yeah, I think she was asking me
how we were doing.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.823
I was, actually, asking...

14:17.890 --> 14:19.291
Okay, only got
about ten minutes.

14:19.509 --> 14:20.491
What are those?

14:20.558 --> 14:22.492
Zucchini. I'm gonna hand them
out to the kids.

14:22.559 --> 14:23.793
No, that's not a good idea.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.962
Talking points, community,
healthy living,

14:27.011 --> 14:28.528
and USNB's
significant investment

14:28.596 --> 14:30.997
in the city's Farm
to Table initiative.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.931
Okay, direct your attention
to the kids.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.765
It's a simple grip and grin.

14:34.832 --> 14:38.835
I know how to talk
to my customers, No.

14:38.850 --> 14:40.066
Ms. Reed.

14:40.133 --> 14:42.234
Hey, everyone,
I'm Mr. Criswell

14:42.302 --> 14:43.602
from U.S. National Bank.

14:44.603 --> 14:47.871
Whoop, there it is.

14:47.871 --> 14:49.521
Huh?

14:49.689 --> 14:50.805
Did he just...

14:50.972 --> 14:52.589
Raise his zucchini in the air?

14:52.606 --> 14:54.824
Like he just don't care.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.125
Look at all you Michelle Obamas
working in the field.

14:57.274 --> 14:58.124
MAN:
What'd he say?

14:58.192 --> 15:00.109
The seÃ±or, the yellow. <i>Me gusta.</i>

15:00.393 --> 15:01.676
MAN: What the hell?
WOMAN: No, he did not.

15:01.777 --> 15:02.760
Somebody catch.

15:02.827 --> 15:03.960
Look at that, boom.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.295
It's in the genes, huh?

15:05.296 --> 15:06.595
"It's in the genes."
Oh...

15:09.030 --> 15:10.747
(low chatter)

15:23.620 --> 15:25.020
Blind date?

15:25.086 --> 15:26.421
(chuckles)

15:26.487 --> 15:28.154
Am I that obvious?

15:28.221 --> 15:30.523
It's on me.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.791
Good luck.
Thank you.

15:39.494 --> 15:41.027
Jeannie?

15:41.094 --> 15:42.894
Hi. Cameron
the kung fu lover?

15:42.961 --> 15:44.695
(chuckles)

15:44.762 --> 15:45.996
Jeannie Van Der Hooven.

15:46.062 --> 15:47.896
I just had a shot of tequila.

15:47.963 --> 15:50.165
Oh, well,
then I need a shot, too.

15:50.232 --> 15:52.266
You look, uh, you look great.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.500
Thanks.

15:53.566 --> 15:56.001
So do you.

15:56.001 --> 15:58.118
You got to check out
the Gaslamp District.

15:58.184 --> 16:00.319
But I feel like
that's too bar scene-y.

16:00.386 --> 16:01.852
Mm-hmm, there's that,
there is,

16:01.920 --> 16:03.620
but, uh, the architecture.

16:03.686 --> 16:05.688
I love the architecture
and the galleries.

16:05.755 --> 16:07.088
There's amazing art there.

16:07.154 --> 16:09.640
Oh, God, when I was ten, I
wanted to be an artist so bad.

16:09.707 --> 16:11.174
Yeah?
I started wearing a beret.

16:11.307 --> 16:12.825
I got very emo.

16:12.891 --> 16:14.892
Oh, wow.

16:14.959 --> 16:16.359
You know what?
Hey, um, excuse me.

16:16.426 --> 16:18.594
Could you, um,
could you grab us another round?

16:18.660 --> 16:20.195
Certainly.
Slow your roll, kung fu Cam.

16:20.261 --> 16:22.062
Hope I'm not gonna need
to know

16:22.128 --> 16:23.930
kung fu tonight.

16:24.063 --> 16:25.514
No, no, no, you're, uh...

16:25.580 --> 16:27.047
You're-you're fine.

16:27.114 --> 16:28.515
I'm just, uh, I'm
having a good time.

16:28.581 --> 16:31.750
So tell me more

16:31.816 --> 16:34.083
about Cameron the kung fu lover?

16:34.150 --> 16:35.484
Mm-hmm, well, um,

16:35.551 --> 16:37.385
as you keep reminding me,
I love kung fu.

16:37.451 --> 16:38.752
Mm-hmm.
There's that.

16:38.819 --> 16:39.952
Uh, I'm a...

16:40.020 --> 16:42.021
a kindergarten teacher
at a Montessori school.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.171
Oh.

16:43.238 --> 16:44.788
Uh, I sing a pretty sweet cover

16:44.855 --> 16:46.956
of all that is Bon Jovi
in the shower.

16:47.023 --> 16:49.374
And, uh,

16:49.440 --> 16:53.009
I'm a big brother to a kid named
Frederick Douglass, no lie.

16:53.025 --> 16:54.959
(chuckles)

16:56.426 --> 16:57.727
Thank you.

16:57.794 --> 16:59.194
You know, you are not, um,

16:59.261 --> 17:00.729
at all what I expected.

17:00.795 --> 17:03.964
Oh, wow, what did you,
uh, expect?

17:04.030 --> 17:06.365
I...
No, no, no.

17:06.431 --> 17:07.564
Come on, you can tell me now.

17:07.631 --> 17:09.065
Tell me, tell me.

17:09.132 --> 17:10.932
Well, considering how we met...

17:11.000 --> 17:12.400
Mm-hmm.

17:12.467 --> 17:15.068
Um...

17:15.135 --> 17:18.204
A socially awkward man-child
with absolutely no game.

17:18.269 --> 17:19.736
Hmm.

17:19.803 --> 17:22.538
So, uh, all right,
so you think I've got game then.

17:22.605 --> 17:25.272
Yeah, but the question

17:25.339 --> 17:27.573
is what's wrong with you?

17:27.640 --> 17:28.940
What do you mean?

17:29.008 --> 17:30.375
Like, in the real dating world?

17:30.441 --> 17:32.142
Well, what's the real
dating world?

17:32.209 --> 17:34.610
The one where
girls like me live.

17:34.676 --> 17:35.743
Uh...

17:35.810 --> 17:37.694
(chuckles)

17:37.761 --> 17:39.479
You're joking, right?

17:39.546 --> 17:41.913
No, my delivery was off,

17:41.980 --> 17:43.381
but I... no, I'm being serious.

17:43.447 --> 17:45.748
Well, I, uh,

17:45.815 --> 17:48.317
actually, I don't do so badly
in the real dating world.

17:48.383 --> 17:52.536
Huh. Then why troll the Internet
for desperate vag then?

17:52.602 --> 17:54.436
(clears throat)

17:54.503 --> 17:56.604
I mean, not mine.
I'm not... I'm...

17:56.670 --> 17:58.238
here on a dare
from my friend.

17:58.304 --> 17:59.404
(chuckles)

17:59.471 --> 18:00.471
Lucky me. Wow.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.906
Um...

18:02.973 --> 18:05.140
I joined the site
because I'm busy, you know?

18:05.207 --> 18:08.125
Kicking it with poor
little Frederick Doug?

18:08.191 --> 18:09.275
(snickers)

18:10.509 --> 18:13.144
Uh, wow. Um, you know,

18:13.210 --> 18:16.412
how do you do in the real
dating world, hmm?

18:16.479 --> 18:18.046
Cameron, I fare pretty well.

18:18.113 --> 18:20.264
I was engaged.

18:20.330 --> 18:23.064
Was, but then I kinda,

18:23.131 --> 18:27.335
I cheated on my frat boy fiancÃ©

18:27.399 --> 18:29.801
for my creepy
Mr. Burns boss.

18:29.867 --> 18:32.469
But that's for another night.

18:32.535 --> 18:34.269
Yeah.
Oh, God, did that just sound

18:34.336 --> 18:36.120
like I wanted to see you again?

18:36.187 --> 18:38.621
No, no, that's,
that's not gonna happen.

18:38.688 --> 18:39.988
No, I know that...

18:40.055 --> 18:41.455
I'm just actually gonna...

18:41.522 --> 18:43.056
pay my part of the bill
at the bar,

18:43.124 --> 18:44.441
okay?

18:44.508 --> 18:46.609
Good luck in the real world.

18:57.146 --> 18:58.380
(knocks)

18:58.447 --> 18:59.581
Hey.

18:59.647 --> 19:01.147
Hey.

19:01.148 --> 19:02.147
You wanted to see me?

19:02.215 --> 19:03.632
You alone?

19:03.699 --> 19:07.769
Oh, Clyde? Look, he's
a dickhead, but he's harmless.

19:10.001 --> 19:11.769
He reminds me
of my last boyfriend;

19:11.835 --> 19:14.103
a driven, oversexed

19:14.171 --> 19:17.589
22-year-old White House staffer

19:17.655 --> 19:21.141
who actually was
running the country

19:21.207 --> 19:24.426
hopped up on frappuccinos,
porn and hope.

19:24.491 --> 19:25.841
That's a weird diet.

19:26.042 --> 19:28.593
Anyway, I just wanted
to hang out with you.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.594
We speak the
same language. We do?

19:30.661 --> 19:33.530
Yeah. Politics,
corporate bullshit.

19:33.595 --> 19:34.962
It's all the same game

19:35.029 --> 19:36.696
of impression
management.

19:36.763 --> 19:38.096
Yeah, yeah.

19:38.164 --> 19:41.833
Trying to give the best
performance of yourself

19:41.899 --> 19:43.467
to endear yourself
to whoever has

19:43.533 --> 19:44.867
the keys to the castle.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.218
Like you. You got
those keys to the Criswell castle.

19:47.284 --> 19:49.519
I do?

19:49.586 --> 19:50.819
I think you do.

19:51.019 --> 19:52.386
Yeah, I do.

19:52.454 --> 19:54.455
Then we should talk.

19:54.521 --> 19:56.488
Mm-hmm.

19:56.555 --> 19:58.857
What's your, what's your play?

19:58.924 --> 20:01.558
Oh, you want to know my moves?

20:01.624 --> 20:03.058
Yeah. Depends.

20:03.126 --> 20:07.329
Um... sincerity.

20:07.393 --> 20:08.694
Mm, sincerity.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.395
People get drunk on sincerity.

20:10.461 --> 20:12.796
Yes, they do. You know what

20:12.863 --> 20:14.630
drunk people do,
right? What?

20:14.697 --> 20:16.798
They write big ol' checks

20:16.865 --> 20:22.235
with lots and lots
of little bitty zeroes.

20:22.300 --> 20:26.403
Sincerity is like,
it's like, a desert mirage.

20:26.468 --> 20:32.106
You could be utterly sincere
and completely insincere.

20:32.171 --> 20:33.304
No one can tell.

20:33.372 --> 20:35.874
That's what I love about
the shit.

20:35.939 --> 20:38.574
Me, too.
(chuckles)

20:38.641 --> 20:40.809
To sincerity!
Yes!

20:40.875 --> 20:43.509
The empty notion that
started religious reformation.

20:43.710 --> 20:47.513
And gave us guilty
liberal hipsters

20:47.578 --> 20:50.247
who wear trucker hats
and guzzle down

20:50.312 --> 20:52.080
Pabst Blue Ribbon in gallons.

20:52.147 --> 20:53.080
What's the quote?

20:53.147 --> 20:55.982
"It's dangerous
to be sincere..."

20:56.049 --> 20:58.166
BOTH:
"Unless you are also stupid."

20:58.233 --> 20:59.266
(both chuckle)

20:59.333 --> 21:00.667
Shaw.
Yeah.

21:00.734 --> 21:02.684
Ain't it the truth?
Mm.

21:07.653 --> 21:08.820
(chuckles)

21:15.824 --> 21:18.692
(both moaning)

21:18.758 --> 21:20.526
Know what else is true?

21:20.592 --> 21:22.159
What?

21:22.226 --> 21:23.727
That U.S. National Bank

21:23.793 --> 21:26.161
and Criswell would
really benefit

21:26.228 --> 21:28.763
from a long-term relationship
with Galweather.

21:28.829 --> 21:29.795
(both chuckle)

21:29.863 --> 21:31.564
I have to say it.

21:31.631 --> 21:35.366
Always closing
the deal, Mr. Kaan.

21:35.432 --> 21:40.753
As far as I'm concerned,
you and Galweather are in.

21:40.818 --> 21:43.486
I'd shake your hand
right not, but...

21:43.552 --> 21:45.553
It's busy.
It's a little busy.

21:45.619 --> 21:50.340
To think that your boss tried
to talk me out of hiring you.

21:50.339 --> 21:52.856
Uh, my boss what?

21:52.923 --> 21:54.390
Yeah, Julianne.

21:54.457 --> 21:56.057
I think it was Julianne.
(chuckles)

21:56.124 --> 21:58.292
When I tried to hire you.
Yeah?

21:58.359 --> 22:00.794
Hmm, really?
Yeah.

22:00.859 --> 22:02.927
What did ol' Julianne
have to say?

22:02.994 --> 22:07.063
She said that you were
a real Galweather gem,

22:07.130 --> 22:08.863
bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit,

22:08.930 --> 22:10.998
and she wanted me
to know that

22:11.064 --> 22:15.602
there were other partners
with more expertise

22:15.666 --> 22:20.737
in handling such high profile
banking institutions

22:20.801 --> 22:22.636
should I choose
to rethink my choice.

22:22.702 --> 22:25.471
Uh-huh.

22:25.538 --> 22:30.542
I told her that U.S. National
wanted Marty Kaan.

22:30.673 --> 22:32.658
Period.

22:32.724 --> 22:34.692
Still do.

22:34.758 --> 22:36.108
You pissed?

22:36.176 --> 22:37.459
What the fuck
do you think?

22:37.526 --> 22:41.178
Good. (moans)

22:41.244 --> 22:43.946
Is that zucchini
in your pants?

22:45.079 --> 22:46.847
Shut up.

22:46.913 --> 22:48.280
(gasps)

22:52.233 --> 22:54.334
Open up, Guggenheim!

22:54.516 --> 22:56.500
Hey, Jeannie.

22:56.501 --> 22:57.551
Hi.
Whoops.

22:57.602 --> 22:58.585
(chuckles)
Can we talk about

22:58.652 --> 22:59.819
whatever this is in the morning?

22:59.885 --> 23:01.653
It's kind of late.
No.

23:01.770 --> 23:03.938
Pretty please? (chuckles)
It's just...

23:03.971 --> 23:06.088
Doug, do you have Fug in there?

23:06.272 --> 23:08.156
Fug? No. Sarah?
No, of course not.

23:08.223 --> 23:09.490
I'm just... It's really late.

23:09.557 --> 23:11.408
I want to meet the ogress.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.893
Shh! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! I want to meet her.

23:13.942 --> 23:15.225
Doug, please. What?!

23:15.293 --> 23:17.594
What?
Ogresses or ogri? What is it? Whatever.

23:17.660 --> 23:19.093
Anyways, they have
very tiny ears.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.294
Did you not see <i>Shrek?</i>

23:20.362 --> 23:21.629
Mm-hmm.
I did, too,

23:21.729 --> 23:24.330
on pay-per-view, after my really
shitty date tonight.

23:24.331 --> 23:27.916
Hey, but you did it
That's great, kiddo. Good for you.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.833
Hey, listen, Jeannie,
Sarah and I have, um,

23:30.899 --> 23:32.300
we've kind of really hit it off.

23:32.367 --> 23:33.634
Doug!
Yeah?

23:33.701 --> 23:35.350
She sounds fat.
(gasps)

23:35.568 --> 23:36.735
Wait! No, no, no, no.

23:36.869 --> 23:39.520
That's your match?

23:39.520 --> 23:40.653
My match sucked balls.

23:40.954 --> 23:43.972
Oh, yeah? So did mine.

23:47.524 --> 23:50.692
(TV playing indistinctly)

23:50.759 --> 23:52.826
MALCOLM:
Hey, yo, what up?

23:52.893 --> 23:54.326
Lakers are pulling it out
in the fourth.

23:54.393 --> 23:57.328
How was San Diego?

23:57.394 --> 24:01.097
Chicago. Last-minute change.

24:01.163 --> 24:03.747
Chi-town!
I love Chicago.

24:03.813 --> 24:05.481
We were there last month

24:05.547 --> 24:06.914
picketing a chain
of bowling alleys.

24:06.982 --> 24:08.916
Fine women
in that city.

24:08.982 --> 24:11.750
Some pizza in the kitchen.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.184
I cracked open
your Scotch.

24:13.251 --> 24:14.784
It's the good shit, bro.

24:14.851 --> 24:17.953
Damn, I want to be you
when I grow up.

24:17.953 --> 24:20.287
Yeah? When do you think
that's gonna be?

24:20.288 --> 24:21.921
(turns off TV)
Squirrel, what the fuck?!

24:22.088 --> 24:23.872
(chuckles)

24:23.939 --> 24:25.606
What do you want, man?

24:25.673 --> 24:26.740
Why are you here?

24:26.807 --> 24:28.457
Plasma, 30-year-old Scotch,

24:28.524 --> 24:32.360
Amy's gluten free pizza,
Roscoe's empty bedroom.

24:32.426 --> 24:34.543
Oh, let me ask you
something.

24:34.560 --> 24:38.180
Are you sure that you're okay
with him living with Monica?

24:38.245 --> 24:40.997
I mean, she fine,
but cuckoo crazy.

24:41.062 --> 24:42.530
I'm not gonna talk to you
about my son, okay?

24:42.598 --> 24:44.198
I just want to ask you
one more time

24:44.265 --> 24:46.817
why you're here
and what you want?

24:46.883 --> 24:48.166
Because you don't
ever come around

24:48.233 --> 24:49.433
unless you want something.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.301
Really?
That's the way you see it?

24:51.368 --> 24:53.052
That's how it is.

24:53.119 --> 24:55.037
So just tell me what you want
and then you can keep it moving.

24:55.103 --> 24:56.837
To see my family, all right?

24:56.904 --> 24:58.604
We never talked
about Dad's illness.

24:58.671 --> 25:01.457
Oh, you goddamn right
about that, <i>we</i> never did.

25:01.523 --> 25:02.856
Nigga, what's your problem
with me?

25:02.923 --> 25:05.291
You're a fucking phony, Malcolm.

25:05.358 --> 25:07.192
And you're a fucking sellout,
<i>Martin,</i>

25:07.258 --> 25:08.925
but we're still brothers,
and Dad

25:08.942 --> 25:10.776
still needs us
to be a family. Okay, hold it.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.678
You don't, you don't give a shit
about Dad.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.529
I'm not falling
for all that,

25:14.578 --> 25:16.413
"I'm just like you, Pops"
bullshit

25:16.479 --> 25:18.280
that you been running on him
for years,

25:18.346 --> 25:19.612
getting all your bills paid.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.932
You want to talk about Dad?
Are you serious?

25:21.998 --> 25:23.215
You're a day late

25:23.282 --> 25:24.983
and a whole lot of dollars
short, little brother.

25:30.418 --> 25:32.886
Dad was in a pretty bad
car accident two weeks ago.

25:32.952 --> 25:36.372
The doctors think
his bradykinesia is advancing quickly.

25:36.437 --> 25:40.056
He's considering doing
some deep brain stimulation,

25:40.122 --> 25:41.339
but he's scared.

25:41.407 --> 25:45.944
So he asked <i>me</i>
to come home.

25:46.009 --> 25:47.492
What?

25:47.626 --> 25:50.344
All that caring for Dad...

25:50.427 --> 25:53.362
he didn't even tell you.

25:53.429 --> 25:54.795
(scoffs)

26:05.500 --> 26:07.834
Use a coaster, motherfucker.

26:16.978 --> 26:20.314
âª Something in me feels
like causing so much mischief âª

26:20.382 --> 26:22.983
âª Repercussions could kill,
it's my consequences âª

26:23.051 --> 26:24.485
âª Don't come near me âª

26:24.553 --> 26:26.888
âª One touch, your life,
man, I will end it âª

26:26.955 --> 26:29.957
âª Then go back in time,
take care of your descendants âª

26:30.025 --> 26:32.427
âª Why, why, why,
I like to see the pain âª

26:32.494 --> 26:34.395
âª I love when other people cry,
cry, cry âª

26:34.463 --> 26:35.797
âª You want to fight,
but you can't âª

26:35.864 --> 26:38.299
âª So don't try, try, try, try âª

26:38.366 --> 26:39.667
âª I hear death coming,
move if you wanna die. âª

26:39.735 --> 26:42.003
Meow.
