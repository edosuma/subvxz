00:06.963 --> 00:08.660
James took
everything from me.

00:08.660 --> 00:11.402
<i>He needs to be stopped.</i>
- It's a slow acting poison.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.317
Levi tried
to kill James today.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.319
I don't want you
anywhere near my family.

00:15.319 --> 00:17.321
<i>So he wants to go back
to when I was a kid.</i>

00:17.321 --> 00:19.497
<i>It's called
Project Blue Moon,</i>

00:19.497 --> 00:22.283
but he can't do it
without the journal.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.589
<i>James is obsessed
with getting that journal.</i>

00:24.589 --> 00:26.722
<i>He'll hurt anyone he needs to.</i>
- And I would never hurt her.

00:26.722 --> 00:29.377
I don't believe you!
He killed her!

00:29.377 --> 00:31.509
I don't think he did.
I think it was Kiera.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.078
Stay there.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.514
I don't want anyone
else getting hurt.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.342
She's now
in charge of Lazarus.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.431
<i>She'll never let you
near that building again.</i>

00:40.431 --> 00:45.219
We can get back inside
if you are willing to trust me.

00:51.007 --> 00:54.228
I still can't get over
how little time I had with her.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.012
I find myself thinking
the same thing

00:56.012 --> 01:00.234
and wondering how I could have
done things differently.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.540
But I am grateful
for the time we had together,

01:02.540 --> 01:05.543
even though we didn't always
see eye to eye.

01:05.543 --> 01:08.329
And I'm grateful
that we had a son.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.422
So what happens now?

01:14.422 --> 01:16.380
We honor
what your mother wanted--

01:16.380 --> 01:19.470
for you to have
a fulfilling life...

01:21.864 --> 01:23.561
Which is why we are going
to take the building

01:23.561 --> 01:25.389
back from Kiera,
fix the portal,

01:25.389 --> 01:26.999
and send your family home.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.914
And we're going
to get Ty back?

01:28.914 --> 01:30.090
Yeah.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.615
You think
all of this is possible?

01:33.615 --> 01:35.138
I've made contact
with an ally

01:35.138 --> 01:37.619
who has offered to help.
We can do this.

01:37.619 --> 01:41.144
I'm certain that together,
we can overcome any problem.

01:41.144 --> 01:42.493
I'm still worried about Levi.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.016
Nobody's seen him
since the wedding.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.410
Why is that a concern?

01:46.410 --> 01:48.717
Levi tried
to kill you yesterday.

01:48.717 --> 01:51.894
His wife died in the sinkhole.
He blames your project.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.026
The drink he tried
to give me at the wedding?

01:54.026 --> 01:57.334
- Yeah.
- You were there too.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.771
And she stopped him.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.949
Then I should probably
thank you for saving my life.

02:03.949 --> 02:07.823
And let me repay that
by getting your family home.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.670
- Hey, how's he doing?
- He's stable.

02:28.670 --> 02:29.932
He's burning up.

02:29.932 --> 02:31.542
It means his body's
fighting an infection.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.717
I'm going to get some herbs
to help with that.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.154
Thank you, Sam.

02:35.677 --> 02:37.722
- What can we do?
- You're doing it right now.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.202
When we go to the building,
stay here

02:39.202 --> 02:40.638
and keep helping Sam.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.684
Wait, what are we gonna do
about Levi?

02:42.684 --> 02:44.468
No one's seen him
since the wedding.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.819
Guys, he's not himself.
He needs us.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.169
We have to find him.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.476
Iz, what we have to do
is find a way home, OK?

02:52.476 --> 02:54.652
The longer we stay here,
the greater the chance

02:54.652 --> 02:57.786
my vision has of coming true.
- Dad, Levi is like family.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.744
Family doesn't do
what he did yesterday.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.572
Maybe yesterday
was him showing us

03:01.572 --> 03:02.747
that he needs us now
more than ever.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.358
Iz.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.797
OK, look, I know things have
been complicated with Levi,

03:08.797 --> 03:10.625
but we wouldn't have survived
without him.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.367
I know I couldn't have.
- Iz.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.978
Levi made his choice.
We have to make ours.

03:15.978 --> 03:16.935
That's it.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.026
Fine.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.290
Izzy.
Izzy!

03:23.290 --> 03:25.640
She'll calm down.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.250
You guys go.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.165
I'll make sure she's all right.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.689
We'll be back
as soon as we can.

03:40.829 --> 03:44.006
- OK, thanks.
- Great job, guys.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.486
All right.

03:45.486 --> 03:48.271
A water tower, huh?
Rad.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.404
Not bad for a little home
improvement project, right?

03:50.404 --> 03:52.406
What we can't forage,
we slap together

03:52.406 --> 03:54.364
with bubblegum and duct tape.
I like it.

03:54.364 --> 03:57.889
Ow!

03:57.889 --> 03:59.456
Hey!
You OK?

03:59.456 --> 04:04.156
Yeah.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.724
Do you hear that?

04:06.724 --> 04:08.987
Yeah.

04:08.987 --> 04:10.728
Where's it coming from?

04:10.728 --> 04:13.862
Is that an earthquake?
- No.

04:15.559 --> 04:18.997
I think
something's underneath us.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.569
Scott, what's happening?

04:29.051 --> 04:31.967
Good God.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.670
Are you sure
you saw a sextant?

04:39.670 --> 04:41.324
I don't remember one
in the clearing.

04:41.324 --> 04:42.717
Trust me, it was there.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.936
It came through
when the Aurora opened.

04:44.936 --> 04:48.592
If we do find it,
I can help you use it.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.028
Figure out where
those coordinates

04:50.028 --> 04:51.465
and that journal lead.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.423
May I ask why you're familiar

04:53.423 --> 04:56.513
with a celestial
navigation device?

04:56.513 --> 04:58.689
When you have
a Navy SEAL for a dad,

04:58.689 --> 05:00.952
you pick up all sorts
of weird things.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.174
Not that I mind the company,
but I got to ask.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.436
Why did you want to join me?

05:06.436 --> 05:09.004
We don't really
talk to each other.

05:10.701 --> 05:11.876
I know.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.531
I just thought
maybe I'd change that.

05:15.706 --> 05:18.448
Not a lot of people
our age down here.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.798
I bet you had a lot
of friends back home.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.757
Less than you'd think--

05:22.757 --> 05:25.499
at least the ones that matter.

05:25.499 --> 05:30.025
But I do miss
having someone to talk to.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.505
What's going on?

05:32.941 --> 05:36.597
I got into a fight with Josh.

05:37.859 --> 05:40.601
I'm just bummed,

05:40.601 --> 05:42.472
and I don't know
how to fix it,

05:42.472 --> 05:44.996
but I'm glad
I could be here with you.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.232
Where is everyone?

06:03.232 --> 06:05.234
This is super creepy.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.542
Anyone here?

06:13.198 --> 06:14.722
Ella?

06:24.427 --> 06:27.778
Shh, get in the truck.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.345
- What happened here?
- Get in the truck.

06:29.345 --> 06:31.042
I'll explain.
- No, explain now.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.435
Riley, if they hear us,
we're dead.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.872
If who hears us?

06:43.925 --> 06:44.795
No way!

06:57.721 --> 06:59.201
OK.

06:59.201 --> 07:02.160
They're going back
into their nests underground.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.206
If they get distracted
by something else,

07:04.206 --> 07:05.990
eventually, they'll retreat.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.427
What the hell
are those things?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.864
Officially, they're called
<i>Vespula maculifrons.</i>

07:09.864 --> 07:12.040
You may know them
as your pesky

07:12.040 --> 07:13.694
neighborhood yellowjacket wasp.

07:13.694 --> 07:15.870
But the Pleistocene version
are far bigger

07:15.870 --> 07:17.611
and immensely more toxic.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.309
Where did they come from?

07:20.309 --> 07:22.180
There weren't any bugs
in here yesterday.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.921
Yesterday,
they were still underground

07:23.921 --> 07:26.097
in their dormant stage,

07:26.097 --> 07:27.447
but this morning,
we woke them up.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.014
So please,
keep your voices down.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.581
These guys
are hypersensitive to noise,

07:31.581 --> 07:33.540
so any little thing
will set them off.

07:34.845 --> 07:37.021
Ella, have you seen her?

07:37.021 --> 07:38.806
I did.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.938
But the bugs came,
and I lost her in the chaos.

07:40.938 --> 07:43.332
I think she left
with everyone else.

07:43.332 --> 07:46.030
People were screaming
and running for their lives.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.510
The wasps
were about to sting me,

07:47.510 --> 07:50.252
so I jumped in here.
- How do we get rid of them?

07:50.252 --> 07:54.561
Uh, we could give them
a nice bath with water

07:54.561 --> 07:56.432
from the tower.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.608
Soap and water
can clog their spiracles,

07:58.608 --> 08:01.393
the pores they breathe through.
Then they're as good as dead.

08:01.393 --> 08:04.135
Or we skip bath time
and get the hell out of here.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.355
That too.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.794
No.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.143
That's Ella.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.064
Hang on.
I think she's alive.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.815
Are all security systems
under our control now?

08:31.815 --> 08:33.469
Good.
- On your knees.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.775
Now we move
to the portal room,

08:34.775 --> 08:36.646
upload the new protocols
from Moore's journal.

08:36.646 --> 08:38.474
And take these men
to containment.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.564
So now you're in charge.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.827
Now I give this project
what it's needed

08:43.827 --> 08:46.700
for some time, focus.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.267
Now we get back to the business
of helping the world.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.008
And those who don't agree?

08:54.751 --> 08:56.797
You're free to leave.

09:01.192 --> 09:02.498
Wait.

09:02.498 --> 09:03.673
If you really want to help,

09:03.673 --> 09:06.546
there are people here
who need it.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.592
Once you fix that portal,
please send my friends home.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.985
I can't do that.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.943
Look what's happened
since they came to Lazarus.

09:12.943 --> 09:15.511
A virus was uploaded,
nearly destroying everything.

09:15.511 --> 09:17.557
The project's been jeopardized
because of them.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.601
I am not going to invite
another problem

09:18.601 --> 09:20.951
into my building.
- Your building?

09:20.951 --> 09:23.519
Look, whatever anger you feel
at what's happened,

09:23.519 --> 09:26.261
you cannot let that
cloud your judgment.

09:26.261 --> 09:29.917
We are here because of
your project's mistakes.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.440
You owe us your help.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.573
I have a responsibility
to many more people

09:33.573 --> 09:36.097
than are down here.
I'm sorry.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.228
This is the way it has to be.

09:37.228 --> 09:38.882
You're making a mistake.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.884
My friends, the people here,
they will not let this go.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.233
If they don't,
I promise you,

09:42.233 --> 09:43.670
they will suffer more
than they already have.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.000
Levi.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.393
Sam.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.569
What are you doing here?

10:13.569 --> 10:15.440
Looking for medicine
to help Silas.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.312
The better question is,
what are you doing?

10:17.312 --> 10:18.313
Are those explosives?

10:20.271 --> 10:22.491
We need to talk about this.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.580
Why don't you go back
to the village?

10:24.580 --> 10:26.582
Why don't you
come back with me?

10:28.018 --> 10:30.238
Look, I heard what happened
with James yesterday,

10:30.238 --> 10:31.456
and I know you're hurting,

10:31.456 --> 10:33.154
and from the looks
of the explosives,

10:33.154 --> 10:34.416
it seems you're not done
with him yet.

10:34.416 --> 10:37.419
Sam, just go.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.987
I don't have any love
for Gavin's father either,

10:39.987 --> 10:42.685
but he's our only way home.

10:42.685 --> 10:45.166
What you're doing,
that's not the way to help.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.689
- It's the only way.
- Levi.

10:46.689 --> 10:49.474
- Stay back.
- I can't let you do this.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.693
I don't want
to hurt you, Sam,

10:50.693 --> 10:51.912
but if you don't walk away
right now,

10:51.912 --> 10:53.870
I won't have another choice.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.357
We gotta get to her now.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.967
No, no, no,
that is a terrible idea.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.927
The wasps have built an empire
beneath the dirt.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.363
You see that opening?

11:08.363 --> 11:10.582
They're all around
the clearing.

11:10.582 --> 11:11.932
That's where the wasps are.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.716
And there's one
right in front of Ella.

11:13.716 --> 11:17.502
We can't get close to her.
- What if we're super quiet?

11:17.502 --> 11:18.982
It's not just noise
that disturbs them.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.724
It's all sound vibrations,
including footsteps.

11:21.724 --> 11:25.162
Think of the ground between us
and Ella as a giant minefield.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.773
One step can be fine,
and then--

11:26.773 --> 11:29.514
The next could wake up
the sting squad.

11:29.514 --> 11:30.646
Ella's never abandoned me.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.126
There's no way
I'm abandoning her.

11:32.126 --> 11:34.041
If we were able
to get to her,

11:34.041 --> 11:35.520
how are we gonna help?

11:35.520 --> 11:36.739
It's not like we can give her

11:36.739 --> 11:38.741
a shot
of prehistoric antivenom.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.875
What about an EpiPen?

11:41.875 --> 11:43.833
My dad has one
in the med kit on the bus.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.836
Uh, I mean,
there are no cracks

11:46.836 --> 11:48.403
between here and the bus.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.840
That shouldn't be a problem
if we stay quiet.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.494
I think we can do this.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.933
Let's go.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.117
My contact
should be here any moment.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.206
I'm gonna go see
if he's nearby.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.381
All right.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.951
- Hey, you OK?
- Yeah.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.823
I just got a lot on my mind.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.738
If you're worried about James
and Project Blue Moon,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.652
I'm pretty sure
he's put it behind him.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.742
I do, too.
It's Levi.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.396
Maybe 'cause he has a point.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.746
Maybe we should
be helping him out.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.573
OK, Izzy's right
in that we treated him

12:28.573 --> 12:30.575
like family because he was,
but he's not anymore.

12:30.575 --> 12:32.795
I can forgive him
for everything

12:32.795 --> 12:35.755
that happened with you
because I had a part in that.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.408
But what he did yesterday,
that jeopardized

12:37.408 --> 12:39.236
our best hope
of keeping you safe

12:39.236 --> 12:41.412
and getting everyone home.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.023
What if we run
into him again?

12:43.023 --> 12:44.720
I don't think
he's gonna give up on this.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.202
When I see him, I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to stop him.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.423
Hey, what's that?

12:52.423 --> 12:54.512
It's the Lazarus
evacuation alarm.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.906
This is Elliot.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.822
He's been quietly by my side
for over two decades.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.606
He's gonna help us
get back in the building.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.434
I'll help,
but I don't think anyone

13:03.434 --> 13:05.610
should be in there right now.
- Why?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.569
Kiera's takeover
inadvertently corrupted

13:07.569 --> 13:08.831
the security network.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.790
Worse, all the animals
in the research lab

13:10.790 --> 13:13.401
have gotten loose.
They're running rampant.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.795
So everyone's getting out
as fast as they can.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.232
But we don't have a choice.
We have to get in the building.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.669
Eve?
Gavin?

13:22.149 --> 13:23.933
Ty.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.195
How did you get here?

13:25.195 --> 13:26.457
How did you get away
from Kiera?

13:26.457 --> 13:27.981
She had no use for me
once she made it

13:27.981 --> 13:29.460
back to the building.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.767
After she let me go,
I started to get this headache,

13:31.767 --> 13:34.726
and anyway,
then I found you guys.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.641
Whatever progress
you've made against the cancer

13:36.641 --> 13:37.947
goes away immediately

13:37.947 --> 13:39.688
if you're not doing
consistent treatment.

13:39.688 --> 13:42.386
When I take back the building,
I will get you your pills.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.867
Ty, you need to go back
to the village.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.477
Paara has been guiding an army
to come save you.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.870
You have to let her know
you're safe.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.567
No, I can't leave
you guys now.

13:49.567 --> 13:50.917
Kiera is not gonna let you
near that portal room

13:50.917 --> 13:52.483
without a fight.

13:52.483 --> 13:53.745
You need
all the help you can get.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.791
Whoever's going
needs to go now.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.662
I've disabled
all the security cameras,

13:57.662 --> 13:59.969
but they'll be back online
in minutes.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.276
You sure you're OK with this?

14:02.276 --> 14:03.886
Yeah, you guys would do
the same for me.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.983
- Thank you for everything.
- Good luck.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.365
Here we go.

14:48.365 --> 14:49.627
This is where
we launch our attack.

14:49.627 --> 14:51.586
From this computer,
I can implement a series

14:51.586 --> 14:53.066
of security protocols
that will allow me

14:53.066 --> 14:54.545
to take back the building.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.243
Then Elliot's team
can detain Kiera

14:56.243 --> 14:57.853
and the rest of her traitors.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.855
- How do you still have access?
- I don't.

14:59.855 --> 15:01.117
The first thing she will
have done is shut me out,

15:01.117 --> 15:02.510
but you do.

15:02.510 --> 15:05.121
It's the same way
that you helped load the virus.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.427
Your credentials
are hidden deep

15:06.427 --> 15:07.907
within the security network

15:07.907 --> 15:10.083
where Kiera will have
a very hard time finding them.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.954
All I need is your handprint.

15:14.826 --> 15:17.873
Yes, I'll take things
from here.

15:17.873 --> 15:20.267
Hey, won't this
alert Kiera we're here?

15:20.267 --> 15:22.486
Yeah, I'm sure it will.

15:22.486 --> 15:24.880
And it's gonna take time
to implement things on my end,

15:24.880 --> 15:28.057
so I need some of you to go
into the western corridors

15:28.057 --> 15:29.537
and manually seal them off.

15:29.537 --> 15:31.539
Every second
we can slow her down

15:31.539 --> 15:34.977
buys us valuable time.
- Understood.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.023
I'll go with Gavin.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.473
All right, I think
we've got enough herbs.

15:52.473 --> 15:55.476
We should get back to Silas.
- No, you go.

15:55.476 --> 15:58.305
I need to find Levi.
- Hang on, Iz.

15:58.305 --> 15:59.567
I'm worried about him, too,

15:59.567 --> 16:01.525
but we have no idea
where he is.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.180
Do you remember
when I was in the hospital

16:04.180 --> 16:07.357
after my accident?
- Of course.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.012
I couldn't have
gotten through without Levi.

16:10.012 --> 16:12.841
OK, On my bad days, when I
wouldn't do physical therapy

16:12.841 --> 16:15.235
or even get out of bed,
Levi was the one

16:15.235 --> 16:17.019
to snap me out of it.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.152
He would say, "I'm not
here to bring you flowers.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.110
I'm here to kick your ass."

16:21.110 --> 16:23.939
That does sound like Levi.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.767
And he told me
that he was gonna go down

16:25.767 --> 16:27.290
to the cafeteria
and get a cup of coffee,

16:27.290 --> 16:29.858
and he was not gonna leave
until I got out of bed,

16:29.858 --> 16:32.904
walked down there, and had
a cup of coffee with him.

16:32.904 --> 16:37.257
He waited in that cafeteria
for two days before I made it.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.649
He hadn't slept,
he looked like crap,

16:38.649 --> 16:41.304
but he was there for me.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.958
OK, now I need
to be there for him.

16:49.182 --> 16:52.054
- Oh, my God.
- Sam?

16:52.054 --> 16:53.055
Sam?

16:54.839 --> 16:56.972
What happened?
You OK?

16:58.191 --> 17:01.063
- I found Levi.
- He did this to you?

17:01.063 --> 17:03.065
Yeah, now he's headed
to the building

17:03.065 --> 17:05.067
with a bunch
of plastic explosives.

17:05.067 --> 17:08.070
I have to stop him.
- Easy, easy.

17:08.070 --> 17:11.421
We got to get you back
to the village, OK?

17:15.338 --> 17:17.993
Hey, Iz!
What are you doing?

17:17.993 --> 17:19.821
I need to get
to that building.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.562
- Izzy, don't!
- I'm sorry.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.781
I have to.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.609
Izzy!

17:33.487 --> 17:36.229
Great, let's get
to the next one.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.362
Hey, hey, are you OK?

17:39.362 --> 17:40.624
Yeah.
Come on.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.713
Ty, wait.
I'll take care of the doors.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.063
You should get
to the infirmary.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.065
There's nobody there.
You can get your pills.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.414
There'll be time
for that later--

17:47.414 --> 17:48.806
Hey, you don't know that, OK?

17:48.806 --> 17:50.591
You got to take the opportunity
while it's there.

17:50.591 --> 17:51.853
I can't leave you alone.

17:51.853 --> 17:52.984
There are animals
in these halls.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.899
Ty, you've done enough
for my family.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.771
It's time you did something
for yourself.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.384
Please.

18:03.517 --> 18:07.390
Thank you.
I'll catch up.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.796
Levi!
Hey!

18:21.796 --> 18:24.625
What are you doing with those?

18:25.843 --> 18:28.629
Levi, hey, look at me!

18:28.629 --> 18:31.153
Levi!
Stop!

18:31.153 --> 18:32.589
You don't have to do this.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.853
No, no, no, Levi!
Levi, look at me!

18:35.853 --> 18:37.464
We can talk this through!

18:37.464 --> 18:40.031
Hey, hey, Levi, listen!

18:40.031 --> 18:41.598
Hey, I know
you lost your wife,

18:41.598 --> 18:43.122
but this is not
how you honor her.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.037
It's not.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.955
You don't understand.

18:52.348 --> 18:54.045
This isn't just about her.

18:55.699 --> 18:59.312
The day she died...

18:59.312 --> 19:00.878
she wasn't alone.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.186
She had our daughter
with her too.

19:07.058 --> 19:08.321
I'm sorry.

19:08.321 --> 19:11.672
This project
has taken everything from me.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.286
I got to stop it.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.769
Levi!
Hey, hey!

19:25.251 --> 19:26.991
You need to leave.

19:26.991 --> 19:29.255
I'm gonna destroy
this entire building.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.649
No.

19:32.649 --> 19:35.565
Levi!
Hey!

19:40.004 --> 19:42.050
Levi!

19:45.532 --> 19:48.230
I need an update
on those stabilization numbers.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.537
We're 90% through
instituting the new directives.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.582
We're on the verge
of fixing the machine.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.544
- What now?
- Threat level breach.

19:57.544 --> 20:00.329
Someone in the executive lounge
accessed the security network.

20:00.329 --> 20:04.028
It appears to be Gavin.
- This is James.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.553
Get your team
to the executive lounge now,

20:06.553 --> 20:07.597
and watch yourselves.

20:07.597 --> 20:08.598
Those animals
could be anywhere.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.477
This is your only warning.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.479
Everybody leave
the building now.

20:22.351 --> 20:26.442
Ah-ah, Kiera,
put that journal down.

20:26.442 --> 20:28.009
You're staying.

20:28.009 --> 20:31.012
I need your help.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.335
Where's the EpiPen?

20:51.424 --> 20:53.121
I thought you said it was here.

20:53.121 --> 20:56.080
I thought it was.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.734
Well, you were wrong.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.562
And Ella's out there dying,
and there's nothing we can do.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.308
I don't know what to do.

21:06.308 --> 21:09.355
Veronica,
you need to breathe.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.750
If you're not calm,
you make mistakes.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.883
You can't see the things
that are right in front of you.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.319
OK?

21:17.319 --> 21:20.191
OK, let's just slow down
and find that EpiPen.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.932
OK?

21:21.932 --> 21:24.631
- OK.
- Wait a minute.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.851
Yes!
I'm all over it.

21:27.851 --> 21:30.027
Amazing.
How do we get it to Ella?

21:32.813 --> 21:34.293
I know.
Here's what we do.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.121
We just add soap
to that water

21:37.121 --> 21:39.123
and then quietly
connect the hose

21:39.123 --> 21:40.255
and get it into the crack.

21:40.255 --> 21:41.778
How will that kill
all of them?

21:41.778 --> 21:42.910
There's more than one crack.

21:42.910 --> 21:44.128
What about the one
in front of Ella?

21:45.434 --> 21:48.568
Wasp nests
are interconnected--

21:48.568 --> 21:50.134
typically.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.527
Typically?

21:52.876 --> 21:55.096
It's better odds
than we had five minutes ago.

21:56.532 --> 21:59.666
OK.
Then we have to do this.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.368
Nobody ever said
that killing wasps

22:06.368 --> 22:09.110
was environmentally friendly.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.428
Come on, baby.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.647
Come on.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.003
Do you think it's working?

22:33.003 --> 22:37.007
Oh, I'm sure they're dying
excruciating deaths down there.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.185
So what do we do now?

22:41.185 --> 22:44.058
Not we.
This is on me.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.494
I'm gonna bring
the EpiPen to Ella.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.104
No, no,
we're all going together.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.323
I'd like to say
we got all the bugs,

22:48.323 --> 22:50.020
but I just can't be sure.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.196
That's why
I'm gonna do it alone.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.156
She's my sister.
I got this.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.354
Ugh!

24:17.630 --> 24:20.633
We got to go.
Come here.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.684
OK.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.300
Come here.
Come here.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.650
Shh.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.348
Hey.
Shh.

24:42.350 --> 24:45.788
You're gonna be OK.
I brought an EpiPen.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.226
Here.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.447
Where is it?
Where is it?

24:54.536 --> 24:55.711
No.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.369
No.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.422
What's wrong?

25:15.949 --> 25:18.473
The EpiPen,
it fell out of my pocket.

25:18.473 --> 25:19.648
It's out there.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.351
It's OK.

25:27.351 --> 25:29.136
I'm just happy you're here.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.444
Stop it.
Stop talking like that.

25:33.444 --> 25:34.750
I know that tone.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.925
I heard it
when you were little

25:35.925 --> 25:37.492
whenever you were about
to give up,

25:37.492 --> 25:39.276
but I'm not going to let you.
We'll figure this out, OK?

25:39.276 --> 25:40.800
We still have stuff
we need to do together.

25:40.800 --> 25:44.281
Veronica,
I'm not gonna make it.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.462
You have to.

25:51.462 --> 25:55.554
Together, we were strong.
Alone is impossible.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.033
It's not.

25:57.033 --> 25:58.948
You were always the one

25:58.948 --> 26:01.211
who kept us going
when things got hard.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.736
You always saved me.

26:03.736 --> 26:06.347
You'll be fine.

26:08.349 --> 26:09.655
No.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.395
No, we're gonna
figure this out.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.883
What the hell
are we gonna do?

26:20.883 --> 26:23.233
We have to get to that EpiPen.
- Yeah.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.932
OK, think, Scott.
Think, Scott.

26:25.932 --> 26:29.065
Think.
Think.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.806
Oh!

26:30.806 --> 26:34.114
No, I got nothing.
Damn it!

26:39.728 --> 26:42.165
On second thought,
there may be a way.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.733
I'm gonna need coolant
from the engine,

26:44.733 --> 26:47.388
a roll of duct tape,
and some kind of helmet.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.870
- It sounds crazy.
- You're probably right.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.243
OK.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.682
Yes.
You've got this.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.945
You are not afraid.

27:25.687 --> 27:28.081
Come on.
Clear off!

27:32.433 --> 27:34.565
Come on!

27:37.960 --> 27:40.746
Yes, yes!
Come on!

27:40.746 --> 27:42.573
I can't believe it's working.

27:43.923 --> 27:46.447
Yes!
Come on!

27:51.757 --> 27:54.498
They're flying away.
Yes!

28:02.768 --> 28:04.987
I did it.
I think they're all gone.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.989
Ella, you're going to be OK.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.730
That's amazing.
Give me the EpiPen.

28:10.123 --> 28:13.604
- Oh, no.
- What? What?

28:16.303 --> 28:18.392
You were stung.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.397
I didn't even feel it.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.312
It must have been
the adrenaline.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.142
Veronica.

28:30.796 --> 28:32.972
- Give it to her.
- What?

28:32.972 --> 28:35.061
The shot, she needs it.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.845
No, you need to take it.

28:36.845 --> 28:41.154
Veronica, please.

28:41.154 --> 28:42.808
Please.

28:46.159 --> 28:49.640
- Is there another EpiPen?
- I'm sorry.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.425
There's only one.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.139
Can you give us a minute?

29:43.956 --> 29:45.218
Oh, my God.

30:06.326 --> 30:08.850
The infirmary, thank God.

30:15.988 --> 30:19.861
<i>- Help!</i>
- Gavin.

30:36.051 --> 30:39.228
[creature roaring softly

30:42.928 --> 30:44.581
Help!
Help!

30:55.766 --> 30:57.159
Thank you.

30:57.159 --> 30:59.422
But we have a bigger problem.

30:59.422 --> 31:01.903
Levi, he's about
to make a huge mistake.

31:01.903 --> 31:02.991
What?

31:07.039 --> 31:09.258
<i>We can't
debate this anymore.</i>

31:09.258 --> 31:13.349
You need to take the shot.
- No.

31:13.349 --> 31:16.265
Ella...

31:16.265 --> 31:19.312
you deserve
a long, happy life.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.053
No.

31:21.053 --> 31:23.359
It's your turn.

31:23.359 --> 31:26.145
I came down here
to save your life.

31:29.235 --> 31:32.151
Don't take that
away from me now.

31:36.155 --> 31:37.983
Take the shot.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.161
Please.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.083
Go on.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.694
It's OK.

32:03.573 --> 32:06.054
I can't do it.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.298
I love you.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.261
I love you too.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.600
Have a little faith, Eve.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.603
I'm about to retake the system.

33:20.041 --> 33:21.825
No, I'm--

33:21.825 --> 33:23.784
I'm worried about Gavin and Ty.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.742
They should be back by now.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.440
Oh, I'm sure they're fine.

33:29.659 --> 33:31.661
You know, for somebody
who said that they would do

33:31.661 --> 33:33.924
absolutely anything
to reunite with their son,

33:33.924 --> 33:35.187
I'm a little confused
why you're not

33:35.187 --> 33:36.362
as concerned as I am.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.538
Of course, I'm concerned.

33:38.538 --> 33:41.497
We all have our tasks
that require focus.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.199
- What aren't you telling me?
- Nothing.

33:47.199 --> 33:48.939
I asked that you trust me.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.593
Now, given the complexity
of what I'm trying to achieve,

33:50.593 --> 33:52.465
I wish that you would
honor that request.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.338
You're a smart man, James.

33:56.338 --> 33:58.036
You choose
your words carefully,

33:58.036 --> 34:01.256
and right now, you're choosing
your words very carefully.

34:01.256 --> 34:04.825
So I'm going to ask you again,
what aren't you telling me?

34:06.044 --> 34:08.568
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.787
OK, then let me see
what you're working on.

34:12.615 --> 34:14.574
And if I refuse?

34:16.228 --> 34:19.231
Then the trust you're asking
for doesn't go both ways.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.669
Eve, stop.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.888
Wait a minute,
Project Blue Moon.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.194
You're working
on Project Blue Moon?

34:26.194 --> 34:28.196
What the hell is going on here?

34:28.196 --> 34:29.719
Tell me that what you're doing

34:29.719 --> 34:32.331
isn't going to erase
my family forever.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.246
James!

34:35.073 --> 34:36.378
That's it.
I'm stopping this right now.

34:36.378 --> 34:37.858
No, you're not.

34:37.858 --> 34:39.947
Put it down now.

34:45.561 --> 34:46.910
A few hours ago,
you were making promises

34:46.910 --> 34:48.651
to your son
at your wife's grave.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.479
I thought this family
meant something to you.

34:50.479 --> 34:52.133
If you do this,
you're gonna be throwing

34:52.133 --> 34:53.352
all of that away.

34:53.352 --> 34:56.398
I'm not throwing
anything away.

34:56.398 --> 34:58.966
I am fixing what I broke.

34:58.966 --> 35:03.884
This way, I never lose Gavin,
and I never lose his mother.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.495
You're trading
my family for your own, James.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.933
Look, I get wanting to go back.
I do.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.979
There's not a person alive
who wouldn't want

35:11.979 --> 35:13.459
to go back
and fix their mistakes,

35:13.459 --> 35:15.069
but that's not how life works.

35:15.069 --> 35:18.159
This isn't going to make you
as happy as you think.

35:18.159 --> 35:20.118
Please.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.121
Please, don't do this.
- I've made my choice.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.089
Eve.
Eve, please.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.744
Eve, you don't want to have
to tell your husband

35:37.744 --> 35:40.486
that you killed his father.

35:41.530 --> 35:44.011
Please, put the knife down.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.322
Put the knife down!

36:27.881 --> 36:29.752
Hey,
I just wanted to say...

36:35.236 --> 36:38.587
I know no one
can fill Ella's shoes,

36:38.587 --> 36:41.199
but if you want,
I'm here to talk.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.305
Riley.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.228
I'm not good
at opening up to people...

37:13.056 --> 37:15.145
But I could
really use a friend.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.377
Thanks for being here.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.347
It's time you let me go.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.697
The entire building
has been evacuated.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.394
No, you still haven't
done your part.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.048
Which is what exactly?

37:48.048 --> 37:50.268
Shift all auxiliary power
to the portal.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.749
If I do that,
those explosives

37:53.749 --> 37:55.838
will destroy
the entire building.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.884
I guess they do put
the smart people in charge.

37:59.364 --> 38:00.930
I won't do it.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.629
I can't destroy this project.
It's too important.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.633
Think really hard about that.

38:20.210 --> 38:21.690
It's done.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.434
Maybe one day
you'll realize

38:26.434 --> 38:28.784
that that was the moment
you actually did something good

38:28.784 --> 38:31.352
for humanity.

38:35.269 --> 38:37.271
No, Levi!

38:37.271 --> 38:40.274
- Dear God.
- You need to stop this.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.320
- I told you to leave.
- Yeah?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.843
You know I can't do that.

38:43.843 --> 38:45.975
I made a promise
to my family to get them home.

38:45.975 --> 38:48.108
Gavin, if you don't
walk away now,

38:48.108 --> 38:49.849
what happens next is on you.

38:49.849 --> 38:51.198
What's that?

38:54.157 --> 38:55.202
Levi.

38:56.769 --> 38:57.987
You're gonna shoot me?

38:59.380 --> 39:02.252
After everything
we've been through?

39:02.252 --> 39:03.863
I don't want to.

39:05.212 --> 39:08.650
Please, it doesn't
have to end like this.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.827
Wait.

39:13.263 --> 39:14.352
Iz.

39:17.877 --> 39:20.401
Iz, you shouldn't be here!
- Izzy, he's right.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.185
You need to go now.

39:22.185 --> 39:23.970
That's exactly what I said
to you in the hospital,

39:23.970 --> 39:25.275
but you stayed.

39:26.581 --> 39:29.845
- No, Izzy, this is different.
- No, it's not.

39:29.845 --> 39:31.760
I needed help then
like you do now.

39:33.327 --> 39:36.504
OK, but I'm not gonna
help you here.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.027
What are you talking about?

39:38.027 --> 39:40.508
I'm gonna be
in the cafeteria.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.031
OK?

39:42.031 --> 39:44.033
When you're ready to talk,
I'm gonna be there.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.861
Izzy, this whole building
is gonna explode.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.776
Then it's gonna explode
with me in it.

39:53.216 --> 39:54.304
Levi.

40:01.311 --> 40:03.792
Izzy, wait.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.884
I won't lose you too.

40:23.072 --> 40:25.553
Levi, why isn't it stopping?

40:26.728 --> 40:28.687
I don't know.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.384
Pull the damn wire.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.910
What's happening?

40:34.910 --> 40:36.912
This was built
by someone in '98.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.566
They must have put in
a failsafe.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.089
- What does that mean?
- It's not gonna stop.

40:40.089 --> 40:42.570
Look, we've got to move now!
