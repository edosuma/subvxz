00:04.440 --> 00:06.360
You need to give my son a job.

00:06.480 --> 00:08.680
The old lady in the bungalownext door, she's not budging.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.120
I'm working on it.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.360
When I was in prison, Imet someone, and this man,

00:12.480 --> 00:13.840
he was not good to her.

00:13.960 --> 00:15.440
Apparently, he had alsodreamed of dumping his wife

00:15.560 --> 00:17.680
and fucking some little slutwho spread her legs for him.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.800
Evan has a pile of
these bearer bonds

00:19.920 --> 00:22.920
and many suitcases
of actual money.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.800
WOMAN: We're going to
take everything he owns,

00:26.920 --> 00:28.640

00:31.880 --> 00:32.680
MAN: Nowhere near this place.

00:32.800 --> 00:33.680
WOMAN: She took the bonds.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.920
How the fuck did that happen?

00:36.040 --> 00:36.840
You used me.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.160
What do you think?

00:42.280 --> 00:43.160
I like it.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.640
You're not just saying that?

00:44.760 --> 00:46.080
It's going to be animprovement on the water bed.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.240
Anything would be animprovement on that, Mike.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.840
There's only one way
to find out, right?

00:50.960 --> 00:52.240
I have no idea what you mean.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.480
[phone rings]

01:02.600 --> 01:03.440
Ignore it.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.960
Thanks for coming.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.720
Jesus, Rita.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.720
This better be fucking
important, dragging me

01:38.840 --> 01:39.920
halfway across town.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.600
[music playing]

01:54.160 --> 01:54.960
Stop checking your watch.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.400
It doesn't.
Help.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.320
It just makes it worse.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.680
She should be back by now.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.960
They'll be back
when they get here.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.440
Except if they don't.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.640
We try not to
think about that.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.840
Hey, hey.
Slow down.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.800
Jesus, Finnius.

02:14.920 --> 02:15.760
What the f--

02:18.400 --> 02:19.360
Wouldn't even
be doing this job

02:19.480 --> 02:22.000
if it wasn't for bloody Lefty.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.400
Well, the boys
have their own ways

02:23.520 --> 02:25.440
of dealing with these things.

02:25.560 --> 02:26.400
[engine revving]

02:26.520 --> 02:27.920
Ha, ha.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.720
Very funny.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.720
Don't be assholes, let me in!

02:33.840 --> 02:35.560
The boys and I
feel that you could

02:35.680 --> 02:38.600
use a bit of a walk to reflecton the error of your ways.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.680
MAN: By losing our
money, dipshit!

02:40.800 --> 02:41.920
That is fucking miles away?

02:42.040 --> 02:43.120
It will give
you time to think.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.000
Ta ta.

02:44.120 --> 02:46.720
[men chortling]

02:48.040 --> 02:49.480
You're just luck
Ngaire isn't here.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.880
She always hated
it when we wondered

02:51.000 --> 02:52.320
what the men were doing.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.600
Or Ngaire just didn'twant to think about Lefty.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.080
Yeah, there was that.

02:56.200 --> 03:00.000
I wonder if Ngaire misses us.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.440
[woman moaning]

03:05.000 --> 03:06.320
[popping sound]

03:06.440 --> 03:09.240
Oh!

03:09.360 --> 03:12.680
Abandon ship, we've run aground.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.840
Ngaire's get her
own life, Carol.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.560
It has nothing to do with us.

03:15.680 --> 03:17.600
Just wondering, that's all.[door opening]

[men laughing]

03:18.760 --> 03:20.560
Hey, lady.

03:20.680 --> 03:21.520
Hey.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.400
Hi, honey.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.320
How was it?

03:23.440 --> 03:24.560
We made Lefty walk home.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.920
It was choice.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.240
OK.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.640
It's the grown up way
of dealing with it.

03:28.760 --> 03:29.680
How was it?

03:29.800 --> 03:31.280
Ah, a walk in the park.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.480
Here?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.680
I want to fucking
throttle Rihanna.

03:34.800 --> 03:35.800
Good take?

03:35.920 --> 03:37.360
Enough for now.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.360
Is Lefty looking
after the money?

03:39.480 --> 03:40.680
No.

03:40.800 --> 03:43.720
Going to get his share
when he catches up.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.920
Long story.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.880
[knock at door]

03:49.000 --> 03:50.280
We were here all night.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.320
Doing what?

03:51.440 --> 03:52.240
Does it matter?
We were here.

03:52.360 --> 03:53.120
You know the drill.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.840
I apologize for the latenessof the hour, Mrs. Rita.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.080
But my needs, they
drove me here.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.520
What needs are these?

04:02.640 --> 04:05.880
The need for food thisis not deep fried potato.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.720
I think I am getting the scurvy.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.200
Well, you better come in then.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.400
Hallelujah.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.600
On the one condition
that you tell me

04:13.720 --> 04:14.920
what's going on at that flat.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.400
Oh.

[people shouting]

04:25.400 --> 04:28.240
[explosions]

04:31.800 --> 04:32.680
Oh, you should have a go.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.000
Yeah.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.840
The vacuum cleaner tube
is starting to melt.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.440
Is that what we fucking are?

04:37.560 --> 04:39.160
Shooting skyrockets
at the old lady

04:39.280 --> 04:40.320
next door until she moves out?

04:40.440 --> 04:41.960
This is the gig you got us.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.120
Yeah, free rent
and the piss money.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.520
It's a good gig.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.200
This is bullshit.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.880
We're living in
a dump being paid

04:49.000 --> 04:50.080
to party when we
should be out there

04:50.200 --> 04:51.480
making the fucking world ours.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.600
Sorry, you lost me
at being paid to party.

04:55.720 --> 04:58.280
We're better than this.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.080
We're way better than this shit.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.640
Should we resume
the rocket attack?

05:02.760 --> 05:03.560
Fire away.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.520
[muffled explosions]

05:13.600 --> 05:21.200
What you said to those
losers is so right.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.760
You should be
doing so much more.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.040
I've known that from the start.

05:37.960 --> 05:38.720
You don't need them.

05:41.080 --> 05:41.840
You don't need anyone.

05:53.120 --> 05:53.920
Except me.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.400
[rock music playing]

06:27.400 --> 06:28.640
Ah.

06:28.760 --> 06:29.520
What a shithole?

06:33.680 --> 06:35.960
Good morning, Mr. Evan.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.120
How are you this
beautiful morning?

06:38.240 --> 06:40.400
Not as perky as
you, obviously.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.960
Ah, Thankfully here's
the man I want to see.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.680
Wolf.
- Hey, Evan.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.040
Good to see my
troops in the war

06:46.160 --> 06:47.800
against decency are holding up[fly buzzing]

06:47.920 --> 06:49.440
Yeah, they're givingeverything for the cause.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.680
Good to hear.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.560
I bring supplies.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.360
So you'll be pleased toknow the old lady out back

06:57.480 --> 06:59.360
has finally given up the ghost.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.280
She died?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.320
Did a rocket hit her?

07:02.440 --> 07:03.440
Yeah, yeah.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.480
A rocket hit her,
and she's dead.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.080
No, numbskull.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.000
This morning she decided tocall the helpful real estate

07:10.120 --> 07:12.120
agent who's been
leaving cards for her,

07:12.240 --> 07:14.400
and tell him that
this neighborhood is

07:14.520 --> 07:17.000
gone to the dogs,
and she's selling up.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.920
OK, so we can move
on to something else.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.240
Are you kidding me?

07:21.360 --> 07:22.400
No, you guys are
naturals when it

07:22.520 --> 07:23.960
comes to anti-social behavior.

07:24.080 --> 07:27.160
Keep carrying on until
I own the whole suburb.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.800
- Lovely.
- Wait your turn.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.600
A little bi early in theday for that, isn't it?

07:30.720 --> 07:31.920
MAN: Not after the
morning I've had.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.240
Buying up houses?

07:33.360 --> 07:34.680
Apart from that.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.800
I've got some lawyers, pascoming back to haunt me.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.120
It's enough to drive
a man to drugs.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.000
Luckily.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.720
[snorting sound]

07:41.840 --> 07:44.720
Anything we can do to help.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.560
You're an ambitious
one, aren't you?

07:46.680 --> 07:47.840
Something wrong with that?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.840
Once upon a time,
I would have said no.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.720
But these days, I
wonder if I wasted

07:52.840 --> 07:54.520
my youth trying to get rich.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.440
Well, if you want the wholedeal, you can move in here.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.840
Let me run things for a while.

07:57.960 --> 07:58.760
Yeah.

07:58.880 --> 07:59.680
That's a hilarious idea.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.800
I love it.

08:01.920 --> 08:02.720
Are you serious?

08:02.840 --> 08:03.720
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.960
Patience my friend, is a virgin.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.000
Unlike some.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.640
I'm going to be
so fucking late.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.840
Donnie, can you give me a lift?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.920
Jeanette, this is Evan,
our landlord, sort of.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.720
Hi.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.520
Hi.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.040
Is that coke?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.080
You know what, Jeanette?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.680
It is.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.680
Would you like some?
- Hell, yeah.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.680
Shit.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.520
Mom.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.800
I know you.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.640
We should take this outside.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.560
This is Rita.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.480
Is that food?

08:50.760 --> 08:53.080
Mom, you really have to warnme when you're coming over.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.800
Why is that, Wolf?

08:54.920 --> 08:56.360
So you can tidy up?

08:56.480 --> 08:58.240
Well, good luck with
that in the squalor.

08:58.360 --> 09:02.040
Or is that so Evan fuckingLace isn't here when I arrive?

09:02.160 --> 09:04.240
I do have one question, though.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.920
What is that little
skank doing here?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.480
I presume you are
talking about Jeanette.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.400
Please tell me
that is Eric and not

09:11.520 --> 09:13.080
you sticking his dick into her.

09:13.200 --> 09:13.960
Bloody hell, mom.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.440
So it is you?

09:15.560 --> 09:19.360
Yes, she's kind of
like my girlfriend.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.240
Dump her, Wolf.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.280
She is trouble.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.240
I like her, OK?

09:24.360 --> 09:25.520
It's not like I'm
going to marry her.

09:25.640 --> 09:26.840
Well that would be
over my dead body.

09:31.080 --> 09:32.200
So was that food you brought?

09:35.360 --> 09:36.160
Yes.

09:39.720 --> 09:41.560
You are a
lifesaver, Mrs. Rita.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.520
She's such a bitch.

09:46.640 --> 09:50.120
I bet she's actually a dyke.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.560
Wolf's mom's a lesbian.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.200
Well, she looks like one.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.160
Plus, she was in prison.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.760
For real.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.720
Couple of years back.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.760
Apparently, she shot a guy.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.440
Ted.

10:08.560 --> 10:10.560
You need to go to that hovel,and bring our boy home.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.800
Kicking and screaming
if necessary.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.520
Uh, yeah.We can talk about it later.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.840
Goldilocks.
The one who robbed us.

10:15.960 --> 10:16.800
She's got her hooks into us.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
Doesn't sound good.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.600
But right now you
have a visitor.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.520
I do?

10:20.640 --> 10:21.400
Bathroom.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.560
G'day, Rita.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.560
[men shouting]

10:39.560 --> 10:41.640
Come on, you've got
two sisters, right?

10:41.760 --> 10:43.480
One of them must
be up for a party.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.360
Yeah?

10:52.640 --> 10:54.280
When someone is
wearing a hat, witnesses

10:54.400 --> 10:56.480
will always remember the hat,not the person wearing it.

11:01.840 --> 11:05.040
Did you have to burn
my fucking clothes?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.560
Huge bloody coconuts.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.200
Big ass bastards.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.480
One of them punched
me on the cock.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
[man grunting]
- Oh your cock?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.320
Yeah, on right on the cock.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.640
[man grunting]

11:18.560 --> 11:20.080
All this.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.280
All my cars.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.160
Gone.

11:25.840 --> 11:26.800
You need to give my son a job.

11:38.120 --> 11:38.880
You all right?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.520
Yes.
Yeah, bonzo.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.440
Bonzo.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.960
Top of the world.

11:43.080 --> 11:47.040
I was just, um, marvelingat how the universe works.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.200
You know, I um--

11:49.320 --> 11:50.720
I got a call from my
lawyer this morning.

11:50.840 --> 11:55.200
And then poof, thispathway suddenly opened up.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.000
Does he hit in
sometimes, you know?

11:57.120 --> 11:58.840
How the universe works.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.120
Doesn't it, Wolf?

12:00.240 --> 12:02.760
Yeah, I'm not sure
all that coke helps.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.920
Sometimes, Wolf, cocaineis great for providing

12:06.040 --> 12:07.160
the gift of clarity.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.120
You sure you're goingto be all right to drive?

12:14.240 --> 12:16.000
Oh yeah, you bet.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.520
One of the many things
I'm now certain of.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.840
[engine revving]

12:30.320 --> 12:32.000
Good.
Thank you.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.240
I'll have Eric bring themdown on his next run.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.560
Rod Nugent is such a cock.

12:36.680 --> 12:37.880
Ngaire, Can You
give us a minute?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.160
But Ingrid from
Clyde is calling

12:39.280 --> 12:40.280
back about the jade figurines?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.200
Ingrid can wait.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.240
Hello.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.640
Hello.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.560
10 minutes.

12:47.680 --> 12:48.440
You're the boss.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.640
Better than
nothing, I suppose.

13:07.760 --> 13:09.240
I would never cheat you.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.720
It's not exactly what wetalked about, though, was it?

13:10.840 --> 13:11.840
Do you think
you're the only one

13:11.960 --> 13:13.200
who is pissed off about this?

13:13.320 --> 13:14.320
It is what it is, Belinda.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.880
You know the most
disappointing thing?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.760
My jewelry.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.400
That's what I really wanted.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.480
More than any money.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.840
According to what
I heard, you threw

13:27.960 --> 13:29.160
your jewelry off your yacht.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.800
Well, what's gone
it's gone, I guess.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.080
Yeah.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.560
I need a job.

13:43.680 --> 13:44.680
Welcome to the real world.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.120
Look after this for me.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.240
Haven't I already done that?

13:53.360 --> 13:56.000
Rita, I got out of jailand I flew straight here.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.520
I won't be here for long.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.440
But right now, I
want two things.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.240
I want to go shopping.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.840
Fair enough.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.360
And I'm horny as fuck.

14:09.240 --> 14:13.960
Belinda, what we had
when we were inside--

14:14.080 --> 14:16.400
Which was, by mutual
agreement, very good

14:16.520 --> 14:17.960
as I recall.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.480
We had our moments.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.760
I'd happy go there again,but what I need right now,

14:22.880 --> 14:24.760
it involves cock.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.680
[music playing]

14:28.800 --> 14:30.120
Falani, you can't have it all.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.600
She gave it to me.

14:31.720 --> 14:34.560
Man, hand it over.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.480
Truly food made
by a mother's hand.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.880
It's food for the soul.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.800
[phone rings]

14:39.920 --> 14:40.720
Hey, someone get that.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.040
Yes.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.360
Wolf, just the man I'm after.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.680
Oh, you made it
home all right.

14:49.800 --> 14:50.560
Of course I did.

14:50.680 --> 14:52.040
Why wouldn't I?

14:52.160 --> 14:53.920
You know how you've beenbegging me to get you a job?

14:54.040 --> 14:55.080
Well, I wouldn't
say banging on.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.880
I would.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.880
But the point is, I
have something for you.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.160
Yeah, what is it?

15:00.280 --> 15:01.880
No, not over the phone.

15:02.000 --> 15:02.760
You and I need to meet.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.280
Where is she now?

15:15.400 --> 15:18.960
Shopping or fucking
some random guy.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.840
I wouldn't normally care,except whatever she's doing,

15:20.960 --> 15:22.960
she'll still be my problemwhen she's finished.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.600
Well, she can stay
for a while if it helps.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.640
She still thinks I owe her.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.320
You think I owe
her too, don't you?

15:31.440 --> 15:32.440
I'm not saying anything.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.720
Well, if you
want to be helpful,

15:33.840 --> 15:35.400
you can find her
the cock she craves.

15:35.520 --> 15:36.920
With any luck, she'll
move on to him.

15:37.040 --> 15:37.800
Yeah?

15:37.920 --> 15:38.760
Shouldn't be too hard.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.040
Really?

15:40.160 --> 15:41.440
Why is that, Ted?

15:41.560 --> 15:45.480
She's not exactly
hard on the eye, is she?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.080
I mean, for her age.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.320
Now, if you want a job,you're more than welcome.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.560
No, I'm just saying.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.120
Go on.

15:55.240 --> 15:59.240
I remember how horny you werewhen you got out of prison.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.600
There were days we
didn't get out of bed.

16:03.640 --> 16:05.880
What about Bilkey?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.520
He'd be up for the job.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.960
Uh, nah.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.080
Can't really see
those two together.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.160
Or Lefty?

16:13.280 --> 16:15.200
He's single, I think.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.360
I don't what the story is withhim and that Theresa girl.

16:18.480 --> 16:21.920
Mind you, even if he wasn'tsingle, that wouldn't stop him.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.560
Actually, there is
something in that.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.600
This is a lovely
house you have.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.600
Thank you.

16:28.720 --> 16:29.920
I've worked very hard for it.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.360
Nothing wrong with hard work.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.000
Exactly true
attitude that I admire.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.720
BELINDA LACE: As long as youenjoy the fruits of your labor,

16:34.840 --> 16:35.680
of course.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.280
[chuckling]

16:37.400 --> 16:38.160
The more you can mix businesswith pleasure the better,

16:38.280 --> 16:39.440
I say.
- And I concur.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.880
Good To know.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.760
I love a girl who
enjoys her work.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.560
And you're a friend of Rita's?

16:46.680 --> 16:47.800
We go back a few years.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.800
And you're looking for work?

16:49.920 --> 16:52.720
Unfortunately, circumstanceshave led me down that path.

16:52.840 --> 16:54.440
MAN: Dad?
- Not now, Hayden.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.040
But Vera Belani
called to say she

16:56.160 --> 16:58.720
is not coming in because she'sgoing to live in Isengard.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.000
Say what?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.120
Some commune orsomething up in the hills.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.720
Plus, she thinks
she's pregnant again.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.400
Yeah.
OK.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.080
Can this what?

17:06.200 --> 17:06.880
But the guy from the council'shere for his monthly freebie.

17:07.000 --> 17:07.800
Can't Theresa do him?

17:07.920 --> 17:09.120
She says no way.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.120
I mean, not after the
last time, when keep

17:10.240 --> 17:11.120
trying to do her in the ass.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.400
Hayden, go away.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.560
Go and sort it out.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.640
That's what I'm
training you to do.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.920
Sorry, we were--

17:18.040 --> 17:19.280
I believe we were
just getting to the bit

17:19.400 --> 17:20.720
where you offer me a job
in your knocking shop.

17:20.840 --> 17:21.840
Is that right?

17:21.960 --> 17:23.440
Oh, you do cut to the chase.

17:23.560 --> 17:24.600
Is that what you
think I'm suited

17:24.720 --> 17:25.920
for now, being a prostitute?

17:26.040 --> 17:28.240
You wanted cock
and you need a job?

17:28.360 --> 17:30.800
Two birds, one stone.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.880
Sorry, what did you think thiswas if it wasn't an interview?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.320
I thought I was meeting a guy.

17:37.440 --> 17:38.240
Oh.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.600
Geez.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.160
Normally I'd be in like
Flynn, but I'm married.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.400
And my wife would kill me ifI touched one of my girls.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.680
I'm not one of your girls.

17:44.800 --> 17:47.080
Well, I've got that now.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.480
Would you excuse me?

17:48.600 --> 17:50.080
I have a situation
I need to sort out.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.280
Look, you're not some
rich housewife anymore,

17:55.400 --> 17:57.040
and beggars can't be choosers.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.000
Drink?

18:10.120 --> 18:10.960
Sure

18:11.080 --> 18:12.360
Harvey Wallbanger?

18:12.480 --> 18:14.040
I don't know the bloke.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.920
Sounds American.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.560
It's what I'm
making, the drink.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.680
Rita said that you were
hoping to meet someone.

18:22.800 --> 18:23.960
I thought that might be him.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.000
Did she?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.480
TED WEST: In passing.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.560
It's a cocktail.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.880
TED WEST: I've got there now.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.560
Although I wouldn't
mind if it was a bloke.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.280
The name, as promised.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.640
Can I ask you a question?

18:34.760 --> 18:36.240
BELINDA LACE: Fire away.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.280
Is there a reason that youknow wearing actual clothes?

18:38.400 --> 18:40.120
I'm cooking your dinner.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.040
Right.

18:41.160 --> 18:42.840
Did Rita not I tell you?

18:42.960 --> 18:43.960
Tell me what?

18:44.080 --> 18:45.480
In a women's
prison, all cooking

18:45.600 --> 18:47.520
has done in your
underwear, unless you're

18:47.640 --> 18:50.400
using the deep fryer.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.160
You're taking the piss.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.600
I spilled some
sauce on my dress.

18:54.720 --> 18:58.120
I took it off to sponge it, andthen kind of liked how it felt.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.880
And no one else was home
till you arrived here.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.560
Cheers.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.440
Cheers.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.160
It doesn't make sense.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.520
Yes, it does.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.160
But shutting your eyes,
Indie and the hot chick

19:15.280 --> 19:17.800
were not witnesses to God'sfury, so they were spared.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.960
OK.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.320
You need to come with us.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.280
Why?

19:31.400 --> 19:33.840
Oh, because I fucking said so.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.200
Well, we're busy.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.640
Like fuck you are.

19:37.760 --> 19:38.720
Move.

19:38.840 --> 19:39.640
No.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.320
[slapping]

19:45.440 --> 19:46.680
Is this like a kidnapping?

19:46.800 --> 19:47.800
Yes.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.600
This is exactly
like a kidnapping.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.240
This is about you burningdown the fish factory?

19:51.360 --> 19:52.600
He paid me to burn it down.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.000
This has nothing to
do with fucking fish.

19:55.120 --> 19:55.960
Then what is it to do with?

19:56.080 --> 19:58.120
None of your fucking business.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.760
It is if we're
being kidnapped.

20:00.880 --> 20:04.760
Just fucking grab them.

20:04.880 --> 20:08.840
TED WEST: Oh, well I hopeyou've bloody washed them.

20:08.960 --> 20:11.080
Oh, g'day love.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.000
I want to ask,
but I'm too scared.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.680
No, Belinda's just beentelling me some prison stories.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.160
Well there goes thewhole what goes on inside,

20:19.280 --> 20:21.040
stays inside idea.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.720
You know me after she drinks.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.080
Definitely wasn't that easy tosmuggle booze into Mount Eden.

20:26.200 --> 20:30.080
So what part of thisexplains the lack of trousers?

20:30.200 --> 20:33.200
Oh, she started it.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.560
I definitely get that.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.160
Actually, I spoke spilledGaliano on my pants.

20:37.280 --> 20:40.040
Had to take them
off to sponge them.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.440
You live here, Ted.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.880
You have other pants.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.800
You know, that never
actually occurred to me.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.800
Come on, Rita.

20:50.920 --> 20:55.920
To old times, or mending
bridges, or to anything

20:56.040 --> 20:56.800
you want.

21:09.160 --> 21:09.960
Thanks for coming.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.160
Oh, I'm sorry Wolf.

21:12.280 --> 21:15.120
Did I keep you waiting?I had things to organize.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.160
Took a bit longer
than I expected.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.280
A thousand apologies if I'veinconvenienced you. mean

21:19.400 --> 21:20.760
No, I'm not
saying that at all.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.040
Well, what were you saying?

21:23.160 --> 21:24.720
I just don't know if youwere coming here at all.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.280
Well, I'm here now.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.200
Yeah.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.680
Hey, how's the flat?

21:33.800 --> 21:35.760
You guys having fun?

21:35.880 --> 21:36.800
Living it up at my expense?

21:40.240 --> 21:42.960
Yeah, it's good.

21:43.080 --> 21:44.120
Even, is there a problem?

21:44.240 --> 21:45.800
Yeah.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.200
Well, not, well there was.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.200
There is.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.640
Still is, to a certain degree.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.440
But we can sort that
out, you and me.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.520
Yeah, good deal.

21:58.640 --> 22:03.360
See, the problem is, Wolf,is that for a long time,

22:03.480 --> 22:05.480
things just didn't add up.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.920
But now they do.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.360
The islanders, for example,the ones who stole my cars.

22:10.480 --> 22:15.080
See the thing is Wolf, isthat dear Joanne is, was,

22:15.200 --> 22:16.640
as white bread as they come.

22:16.760 --> 22:19.040
She's from Crushers,
for fuck's sake.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.720
I mean, she probably hadn'teven seen a brown face

22:20.840 --> 22:22.200
until she got here.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.640
So where did she find a crewof cock punching pollies

22:25.760 --> 22:28.560
to do her bidding?

22:28.680 --> 22:31.720
You have an opinion
on this, Wolf?

22:31.840 --> 22:33.160
I don't know.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.440
I mean, I know what you'retalking about, but I--

22:36.560 --> 22:39.320
I don't know what you mean.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.920
Then there was my boat,
the love of my life.

22:45.880 --> 22:49.720
Now if you are stealing
everything from me,

22:49.840 --> 22:53.720
why would you burn
it to the water line?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.120
No, no.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.840
You burn it because
you want revenge.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.120
And you have a psychofire starter on your crew.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.080
Catching on now, Wolf?

23:08.560 --> 23:10.880
But you know what
really gave it away?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.720
Do you?

23:12.840 --> 23:14.640
The hat.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.160
The fucking stupid
Daniel Boone hat.

23:18.280 --> 23:22.120
The hat that your mate Eric waswearing the day that your crew

23:22.240 --> 23:26.160
fogged most everythingthat I own out of my house,

23:26.280 --> 23:29.920
onto some trucks,
never to be seen again.

23:30.040 --> 23:33.920
The same hat he
was wearing today.

23:34.040 --> 23:40.600
Cock punching around, whack jobasses, dipshit in a stupid hat.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.520
Sound familiar, Wolf?

23:45.280 --> 23:46.480
I think all the
coke you've been doing

23:46.600 --> 23:47.640
is messing with your head.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.680
Don't.

23:49.800 --> 23:54.400
Do not treat me
like I'm an idiot.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.880
I already feel
stupid enough funding

23:56.000 --> 23:58.400
the very lifestyle of thepeople that ripped me off.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.800
Talk about salt int the wound.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.280
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:18.160 --> 24:22.760
So, some
acquaintances of mine,

24:22.880 --> 24:26.000
they have you numbskull mates.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.720
Now, if I don't get
the answers I want,

24:27.840 --> 24:31.000
they're going to burythem in a very deep hole,

24:31.120 --> 24:32.760
and they will become
one with the land.

24:35.760 --> 24:36.560
You with me know?

24:36.680 --> 24:39.560
Can we cut the shit?

24:39.680 --> 24:41.120
I have questions.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.720
What do you want to know?

24:47.840 --> 24:48.920
Was Joanne in on it?

24:49.040 --> 24:49.800
No.

24:49.920 --> 24:51.080
Did you kill her?

24:51.200 --> 24:51.960
What?

24:52.080 --> 24:52.920
No.

24:53.040 --> 24:53.840
No, no, no.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.080
We're not like that.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.360
Then where the fuck is she?

24:59.480 --> 25:01.200
Last seen heading
for the States.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.960
I kind of tipped them off,and she saw her chance.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.440
Took the bearer bond
things and shot through.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.920
OK, well that makes sense.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.680
That must have pissed
quite a few people off.

25:13.800 --> 25:14.640
Whatever you're
going to do, just

25:14.760 --> 25:15.480
leave the guys out of this.

25:15.600 --> 25:16.160
They were just grunts.

25:16.280 --> 25:17.280
Oh.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.320
Yeah, I'm sure they were.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.960
It was me.
It was all me.

25:20.080 --> 25:20.920
It was all my idea.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.560
No, that's bullshit, Wolf.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.960
I call bullshit on that.

25:25.080 --> 25:28.120
It was your mom.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.560
I know.

25:29.680 --> 25:35.560
So you bring her to metonight, and then maybe we

25:35.680 --> 25:37.200
can talk about your
friends walking

25:37.320 --> 25:40.960
around on top of the Earth,instead of lying underneath it.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.520
I'll be at my home.

25:46.120 --> 25:49.480
[car starting]

26:22.520 --> 26:24.640
Oh, for God's sake.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.960
When you've got a
minute, we need to talk.

26:27.080 --> 26:27.840
Whoops.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.640
Before you even start,
I don't want to know.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.000
I wasn't going to.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.280
Evan's figure it out.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.320
What we did to him.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.600
How?

26:44.720 --> 26:45.840
Long story issomething to do with Eric

26:45.960 --> 26:49.840
and his Daniel Boone hat.

26:49.960 --> 26:50.840
Fuck.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.960
Fuck, Wolf.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.400
I fucking told you.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.280
I told you to get as faraway from him as possible.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.000
Maybe we shouldn't have thisconversation from you friend.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.040
We probably should, actually.

27:01.160 --> 27:02.720
Wolf, meet Belinda Lace.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.360
Is he going to go to the cops?

27:04.480 --> 27:05.520
No.

27:05.640 --> 27:06.560
You sure?

27:06.680 --> 27:08.000
How are you sure?

27:08.120 --> 27:09.920
Because they need have
to explain to the cops

27:10.040 --> 27:12.480
why he's kidnapped Eric,
Sparky, and Falani.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.400
Thinks he's going to burythem if you don't talk to him.

27:14.520 --> 27:15.400
Me?

27:15.520 --> 27:16.520
He knows it was all your idea.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.840
Not all our idea.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.200
What does he mean, bury them?

27:19.320 --> 27:20.520
Reckon he's got
some associates who

27:20.640 --> 27:21.640
will bury them
where there will be

27:21.760 --> 27:23.120
houses and shit on top of them.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.040
Fucking Dario, it's gotta be.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.120
Can you deal with that?

27:26.240 --> 27:27.320
Yeah, I got it.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.320
He's not going to hurt them.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.520
He hasn't got the guts.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.160
- OK, you can shut your mouth.- Wolf.

27:31.280 --> 27:32.800
He's too much of a wuss toget involved in shit like that.

27:32.920 --> 27:36.000
Hey, this is all your fault.So you can shut the fuck up.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.320
Wolf.

27:37.440 --> 27:38.360
You're the one who
talked her into this.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.440
So everything comes back to you.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.800
Happy with that?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.520
Wolf, just leave it,
and you tell him that I

27:42.640 --> 27:44.040
do not give into threats.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.800
So if he wants to talk tome, he lets those boys go.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.760
Actually, can keep Ericand his stupid fucking hat.

27:48.880 --> 27:49.800
Mom, just come with me.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.880
They walk, then we'll say.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.640
Does she not get
how these things work?

27:53.760 --> 27:55.720
If I let the hostages go,where is the incentive

27:55.840 --> 27:57.560
for her to do what I want?

27:57.680 --> 27:58.840
WOLF WEST: She said
you can keep Eric.

27:58.960 --> 28:00.240
I don't want Eric.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.800
I want your mother, rightnow, in front of me.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.560
Why don't we just go to her?

28:03.680 --> 28:06.560
I'm the one with the fuckinghostages, so she comes to me.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.000
Why are you even
bothered by her?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.720
Joane is the one who endedup with the real money.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.160
She's the one who
screwed us both.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.760
Why don't you go after her?

28:14.880 --> 28:20.400
When you say screwed,in what sense do you mean?

28:20.520 --> 28:24.720
I just mean and she gotaway with the real money.

28:24.840 --> 28:26.080
No.

28:26.200 --> 28:28.960
No you won't.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.560
You were banging
her, weren't you?

28:33.960 --> 28:35.600
I fell in love with her, yes.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.480
Love.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.040
No, you're far too young toknow the meaning of the word.

28:40.160 --> 28:45.520
You were fucking
her behind my back.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.440
You know, stealing aman's stuff is one thing,

28:47.560 --> 28:50.160
but rogering his lady, that's--

28:50.280 --> 28:51.040
that's low.

28:53.880 --> 28:54.680
You're rotten.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.160
Whatever.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.040
What do you want to do.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.560
I want your motherhere, or your friends die.

29:05.680 --> 29:29.280
That's what I want

29:29.400 --> 29:30.760
Ted Fucking West.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.920
Good to see you, my friend.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.200
Your friend?

29:43.320 --> 29:44.120
Really.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.840
Fucking off.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.160
I was just thinking about you.

29:48.280 --> 29:51.040
I was thinking, I need totalk to my friend Ted West.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.720
And you want to talkto me about a kidnapping?

29:53.840 --> 29:55.200
Kidnapping?

29:55.320 --> 29:57.600
Why would I talk to athief about the kidnapping?

29:57.720 --> 30:00.080
Because you kidnappedthree people from my son's

30:00.200 --> 30:01.040
flat today.

30:01.160 --> 30:02.960
That was not kidnapping.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.440
What was that?

30:04.560 --> 30:07.000
- Business.
- Evan Lace.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.080
Evan Lace, yes.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.280
So he asked me to put
these kids the place

30:12.400 --> 30:14.600
out of the picture for a while.- Uh-huh.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.040
Which is where?

30:16.160 --> 30:18.960
They are locked in a shedon some building site

30:19.080 --> 30:20.600
in the middle of nowhere.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.400
But they are fine.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.400
You better not
be bullshitting me.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.680
They have water, even
a damn key in the shed

30:28.800 --> 30:30.400
if they are smart
enough to find it.

30:30.520 --> 30:34.200
We will let them go as soonas Evan gives me the go.

30:34.320 --> 30:37.600
Ted West, I respect
you too much.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.400
I would never lie to you.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.880
OK.

30:43.000 --> 30:43.960
Good to know.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.560
MAN: Come, sit down.

30:49.680 --> 30:50.720
We need to talk.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.240
Oh, I really should
be getting back.

30:53.360 --> 30:56.040
What if I was
to tell you I know

30:56.160 --> 30:58.440
where you and I
could find $60,000,

30:58.560 --> 31:00.760
$100,000 on a good day?

31:00.880 --> 31:05.640
Just sitting on the
footpath waiting for us?

31:05.760 --> 31:07.160
I would say we
should go and pick it

31:07.280 --> 31:09.120
up before somebody else does.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.680
You and I, we are goingto do more crime together.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.560
Don't drink it.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.560
But I'm thirsty.

31:28.680 --> 31:30.920
But what if they poisoned it?

31:31.040 --> 31:32.520
Why would they poison it?

31:32.640 --> 31:34.760
Well, why would
they kidnap us?

31:34.880 --> 31:36.720
I don't know.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.560
Actually.

31:38.680 --> 31:39.720
So can we drink it or not?

31:39.840 --> 31:40.600
No!

31:47.720 --> 31:48.720
And you believe him?

31:48.840 --> 31:50.040
No reason not to.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.640
So you'll got
and get them then?

31:51.760 --> 31:52.560
Eventually.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.000
They're fine.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.360
And I got a bit ofbusiness to do here first.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.520
What, the delis?

31:59.640 --> 32:01.800
Something that could
benefit both our houses.

32:01.920 --> 32:02.840
Got to go.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.840
Wolf is here.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.400
You can tell
Lace to get fucked.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.160
We know where your idiotmates are, and they're fine.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.480
He still wants to talk to you.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.280
And I still have no
desire to talk to him.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.280
I think you should.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.280
Wolf, he has nothing over us.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.960
He has no proof.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.360
Eric and his stupid fucking hat,when he's ripped off his tits

32:19.480 --> 32:20.800
on coke is hardly evidence.

32:20.920 --> 32:23.360
I'm glad he knows.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.320
Saves me having to tell him.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.080
You would get to tell him?

32:31.200 --> 32:34.680
That I ruined his lifejust like he ruined mine?

32:34.800 --> 32:36.520
Fucking oath I was.

32:36.640 --> 32:40.840
It was the one thing
that kept me going.

32:40.960 --> 32:45.000
All the more reason to talk tohim, before shit gets crazier.

32:45.120 --> 32:48.320
Well, better to make a dealwith him now, then God knows.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.080
You don't talk to the devil.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.640
You leave him
twisting in the wind.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.000
Yeah.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.160
We should go talk to him.

33:08.680 --> 33:12.000
[door opens]

33:12.120 --> 33:15.960
[door shuts]

33:24.440 --> 33:27.280
[music playing]

33:40.040 --> 33:41.360
Love what he's
done with the place.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.080
Oh.

33:51.200 --> 33:51.960
Rita.

33:54.960 --> 33:58.400
I'd say something aboutthe mountain in my Hummer.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.800
But that wouldn't doneither of us any favors.

34:01.920 --> 34:02.680
What do you want?

34:08.440 --> 34:10.840
None for you, traitor.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.840
So, it must have reallypissed you off when Joanne

34:18.960 --> 34:20.520
walked away with the prize.

34:20.640 --> 34:21.920
No idea what
you're talking about.

34:22.040 --> 34:22.920
It's OK, Rita.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.520
You can talk freely.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.160
I just want to know everything.

34:26.280 --> 34:30.000
How you did it, how you
stripped my life bare.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.200
So you can pass
it on to the cops?

34:32.320 --> 34:33.680
No, no, no.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.560
I want to know because
I admire what you did.

34:36.680 --> 34:37.640
- Really?
- Yeah.

34:37.760 --> 34:38.960
Hell yeah.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.960
I mean, sure, I was
a little bit pissed

34:41.080 --> 34:42.840
off to start with, right?

34:42.960 --> 34:45.960
But stuff is just stuff.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.440
But the intelligence to
plan that so thoroughly.

34:52.640 --> 34:54.120
Rita, I want to give you a job.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.600
So what do you reckon?

35:00.720 --> 35:03.040
You went to all this
trouble to tell me that?

35:03.160 --> 35:04.520
Well, I had to get
your attention somehow.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.680
Didn't I?

35:05.800 --> 35:09.480
And bugger my
days, there she is.

35:09.600 --> 35:10.680
Nice place, Evan.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.840
Could use some furniture.

35:19.160 --> 35:19.920
Belinda.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.600
My lawyer informed
me that the justice

35:24.720 --> 35:27.120
system had failed to keep youlocked up where you belong.

35:27.240 --> 35:30.000
Isn't there something
about a parole condition

35:30.120 --> 35:32.120
that says you're not allowedin the same city as me?

35:32.240 --> 35:33.360
I must have missed that.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.200
Oh, well.

35:35.320 --> 35:39.120
I am touched that
you felt the need

35:39.240 --> 35:41.840
to come all this way togloat about your evil plan

35:41.960 --> 35:43.720
to ruin me.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.200
Except for one tiny detail.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.720
It failed.

35:48.840 --> 35:54.840
In fact, it has just
made me stronger.

35:54.960 --> 35:59.200
That must really piss you off.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.040
But as always, Evan.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.640
You're wrong.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.880
Am I?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.560
How so?

36:07.680 --> 36:10.240
By assuming that
I'm done with you.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.240
[stabbing sounds]

36:11.360 --> 36:12.120
Fuck!

36:26.280 --> 36:30.120
[opera music playing]

36:37.680 --> 36:38.560
Fuck, fuck.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.560
Call an ambulance!

36:42.680 --> 36:45.040
Call a fucking ambulance!

37:13.960 --> 37:16.880
[phone rings]

37:17.000 --> 37:18.120
Hello?

37:18.240 --> 37:19.040
Rita?

37:23.360 --> 37:25.160
I bought us some timeuntil McCarthy gets here.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.320
Why did you call him?

37:26.440 --> 37:27.760
Because he knows
us, and we really

37:27.880 --> 37:29.120
need that right about now.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.600
And you and I, we need
to work out our story?

37:30.720 --> 37:31.880
What story?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.120
She fucking killed him.
That's the story.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.000
You and I, Wolf.

37:34.120 --> 37:35.560
Why we are here.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.440
We really don't want themlooking too deeply into that

37:37.560 --> 37:38.760
in.

37:38.880 --> 37:39.720
In case they find out
that you started it,

37:39.840 --> 37:40.400
and this is all your fault?

37:40.520 --> 37:42.040
[slapping noise]

37:42.160 --> 37:43.280
Keep your fucking judgmentto yourself, because right now

37:43.400 --> 37:46.120
you and I, we need
to play the game.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.160
Jesus, Rita.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.080
This better be fucking
important, dragging me

37:55.200 --> 37:56.280
halfway across town.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.080
Holy shit.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.200
Couldn't you just dial 111?

38:08.320 --> 38:09.800
I wanted someone
who knows that we'd

38:09.920 --> 38:11.200
never do anything like this.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.400
My son.

38:30.520 --> 38:36.320
He's been working for Evan foralmost a years now, I guess.

38:36.440 --> 38:40.520
Odd jobs, helping out.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.960
He was teaching me in business.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.960
Yes, I know Belinda.

38:45.080 --> 38:46.920
We were in prison together.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.240
I met Evan through amutual friend, Des McEwen,

38:50.360 --> 38:53.400
and he was the one whohelped me get Wolf a job.

38:53.520 --> 38:58.120
It was only when I met Evan at aparty that I realized the link.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.120
Sure.

38:59.240 --> 39:02.200
Yeah, I spoke about his ex-wife.

39:02.320 --> 39:05.120
I was around this
morning, and he said

39:05.240 --> 39:07.400
he got a phone call from her.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.080
He seemed kind of thrown
by it, to be honest.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.520
No.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.000
I didn't know Belindawas in Auckland until she

39:12.120 --> 39:13.960
turned up at my place.

39:14.080 --> 39:18.560
Belinda was getting
drunk, saying

39:18.680 --> 39:21.600
all these things about Evan.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.880
And she wanted to
finish the job.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.960
Sorry, what was
the question again?

39:27.080 --> 39:29.000
RITA WEST: Wolf and
I decided that we

39:29.120 --> 39:33.360
needed to warn him about allthis shit that she was saying.

39:36.520 --> 39:40.560
I thought that she
was passed out.

39:40.680 --> 39:41.680
But she must have followed us.

39:41.800 --> 39:42.600
Yeah.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.280
She just showed up.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.880
I don't know how.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.240
I have had a lot
to do with the Wests

39:48.360 --> 39:49.680
over the years, which
is why Rita called me.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.600
They're rat bags, thieves.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.360
But did they have anythingto do with this murder?

39:59.480 --> 40:00.680
Wrong place, wrong time.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.600
That's what I'd say.

40:07.080 --> 40:12.400
I just think, what
if we hadn't left?

40:12.520 --> 40:19.440
What if we had stayed there andtalked to Evan later, you know?

40:19.560 --> 40:35.120
I can help but feel thatthis is kind of my fault.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.240
Get in.

40:37.360 --> 40:41.520
We'll get your stuff,
then we'll go home.

40:41.640 --> 40:42.880
Oh, Wolf.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.560
You cannot stay at that
house, not after this.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.920
You got to be joking, right?

40:47.040 --> 40:48.440
Not here, not now.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.440
Just get in the car.

40:49.560 --> 40:50.560
I'm going anywhere with you.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.040
Why the fuck would I do that?

40:53.160 --> 40:55.120
This is all down on you,
and you fucking know it.

40:55.240 --> 40:56.040
Wolf?

41:03.640 --> 41:06.840
MAN: Mrs. Lace, this is
a copy of the statement

41:06.960 --> 41:07.960
in which you
confessed to causing

41:08.080 --> 41:09.920
the death of your ex-husband.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.960
You should read it,
make sure it is correct.

41:22.040 --> 41:28.920
[door shuts]

41:29.040 --> 41:30.960
What happened?

41:31.080 --> 41:32.320
You'll read about it later.

41:32.440 --> 41:36.240
Is Rita all right?

41:36.360 --> 41:39.200
You need to get away from her.

41:39.320 --> 41:41.080
She's toxic.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.320
They all are.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.680
Where have you been?

41:56.800 --> 41:58.400
I've been here for hours.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.120
It's been so boring.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.920
Fuck off.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.240
- What?
- You heard.

42:04.360 --> 42:05.200
Piss off.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.080
Get the fuck out of my flat.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.080
What?

42:09.200 --> 42:11.080
Fuck off!

42:11.200 --> 42:12.480
[music playing]

42:12.600 --> 42:14.560
[SINGING] I hope Inever have to sigh again.

42:17.680 --> 42:23.520
I hope I never, I hope I
never have to cry again.

42:26.640 --> 42:31.000
I still want to feed my smile.

42:34.600 --> 42:40.960
Happiness is back in style.

42:41.080 --> 42:44.440
[sobbing]

42:58.480 --> 42:59.480
Hey.

42:59.600 --> 43:01.800
Do you think this
is significant?

43:01.920 --> 43:03.400
No, no.

43:03.520 --> 43:05.120
They leave things like thatin here to get our hopes up.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.680
Do you think we shouldhave at least tried it first?

43:10.800 --> 43:12.760
No.

43:12.880 --> 43:15.040
A tunnels is what we need.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.440
Yeah.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.680
We need to start digging.

43:19.800 --> 43:23.040
[music playing]
