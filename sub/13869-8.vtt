WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.679
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:02.703 --> 00:04.105
but no one noticed...

00:04.138 --> 00:05.173
(growling)

00:05.206 --> 00:06.316
until they began attacking,

00:06.340 --> 00:08.109
coordinating,

00:08.141 --> 00:09.143
evolving.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.045
The animals were mutating,

00:11.079 --> 00:12.656
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.547
(screaming)

00:13.581 --> 00:16.149
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.261
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.285 --> 00:19.820
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:19.853 --> 00:22.290
will be thriving once again.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.626
You cannot exterminate
every animal on the planet

00:25.659 --> 00:26.527
and then repopulate it.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.329
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.362 --> 00:30.164
could be catastrophic,

00:30.198 --> 00:31.841
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.368
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.402 --> 00:36.070
animal experts.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.405
Dariela Marzan,

00:37.438 --> 00:38.672
army ranger.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.474
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.508 --> 00:43.111
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.144 --> 00:46.280
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.750
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:49.783 --> 00:50.851
for the animals.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.221
Time is running out.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.256
Previously on Zoo...

00:55.289 --> 00:57.358
This sloth was capable
of creating an earthquake

00:57.391 --> 00:58.359
in Costa Rica.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.793
We need that sloth.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.795
Clearly, its switch is turned on

01:01.829 --> 01:03.564
and if I can
understand his switch,

01:03.597 --> 01:04.432
I might be able to
figure out a way

01:04.465 --> 01:06.600
to keep yours from
turning on at all.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.203
That's the first six
nucleotides of the ghost gene.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.604
How could Davies create a gas

01:10.638 --> 01:12.673
that targets a gene that
you can't even find?

01:12.706 --> 01:14.608
He'd have to have somebody
even smarter than me

01:14.642 --> 01:15.843
to figure it out.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.445
What if he was right?

01:17.478 --> 01:18.712
Who? Robert.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.381
What if something in his work

01:20.414 --> 01:22.616
could keep other people from dying?
It can't.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.186
Mom. Then why are you bringing

01:25.219 --> 01:26.887
all of this back?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.489
What about me? Does my father

01:28.522 --> 01:29.523
have this ghost gene?

01:29.557 --> 01:30.767
Maybe you didn't
inherit the gene.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.759
Maybe your dad

01:31.792 --> 01:33.761
made a synthetic version of it,

01:33.794 --> 01:35.363
and he injected you with it.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.836
The professor's
asking about his son.

01:36.864 --> 01:38.232
He's refusing to continue.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.700
Reach out to our asset.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.203
It's me.
Is Jackson Oz still on board?

01:42.236 --> 01:43.647
Yeah. You want me
to take care of him?

01:43.671 --> 01:45.439
No, sit tight. I'll be in touch.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.353
(growling) MITCH: Nope!

01:59.387 --> 02:01.189
All right, get the needle.
Get the needle.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.368
JACKSON: Why didn't
the nitrous oxide work?

02:04.392 --> 02:05.326
(hissing)

02:05.359 --> 02:07.528
MITCH: It froze before
it could take effect.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.696
Injection's the only way.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.364
ABRAHAM: Okay, I got him.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.167
JACKSON: Easy. Hold him tight.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.568
Okay, okay, okay.

02:14.602 --> 02:15.569
Injection's in.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.637
Okay.

02:16.670 --> 02:20.140
(growling)

02:22.343 --> 02:23.811
(growling continues)

02:23.844 --> 02:25.279
Is he unconscious?

02:25.313 --> 02:27.315
Looks like he's getting there.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.450
Damn, that thing is ugly.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.285
Imagine if it made it downtown.

02:31.319 --> 02:34.288
Would have turned South
Beach into the South Pole.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.257
Yeah, I've had enough
cold for a while.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.260
So, Logan and I are
gonna take the other SUV.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.861
Sounds good to me.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.599
Wish I could put Logan
in there with you.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.338
(tires screech)

02:53.507 --> 02:54.508
Let's go, move!

02:55.409 --> 02:56.529
(engine revs, tires screech)

03:00.013 --> 03:01.482
(phone chimes, buzzes)

03:05.553 --> 03:06.520
Everything all right?

03:06.554 --> 03:07.655
It's just my sister.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.590
She's a bit dramatic.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.527
Mom used to call
her Chicken Little.

03:13.561 --> 03:14.562
Look outside lately?

03:14.595 --> 03:15.863
The sky's falling.

03:15.896 --> 03:16.997
(chuckles)

03:17.030 --> 03:18.832
Do you think that
they would miss us

03:18.866 --> 03:20.601
if we just turned back around?

03:20.634 --> 03:23.237
We could go check out
a little beach bar.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.572
I'll buy you a drink.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.839
Are you serious?

03:25.873 --> 03:28.342
Dude, we're kind of in
the middle of something.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.653
Yeah, they got it.
Let's just go.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.911
We can't just take off.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.983
(laughs)

03:36.016 --> 03:37.685
Forget I said anything.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.553
Rain check.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.259
(drill whirring)

03:46.560 --> 03:49.630
First time we captured
a Triple-Helix animal

03:49.663 --> 03:50.831
before it was able

03:50.864 --> 03:52.833
to create an
environmental catastrophe.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.435
Local authorities
have been notified

03:54.468 --> 03:56.404
in case any more
flash-freezing lizards

03:56.437 --> 03:57.505
turn up in Florida.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.341
Well,
we're gonna try and have a cure

04:00.374 --> 04:01.609
before they do.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.477
So, what's the last
Triple-whatever animal

04:03.511 --> 04:05.279
that we need to track down?

04:05.313 --> 04:07.047
Triple-Helix.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.983
Try and keep up, genius.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.586
And to answer your
question, I don't know yet.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.521
The rest of these bones,

04:13.554 --> 04:15.356
I could put together
with my eyes closed.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.024
The vulture...

04:17.057 --> 04:18.926
the sloth, the snake.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.793
Lizard.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.297
This last set just
doesn't make any sense.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.641
Gonna take me a while
to figure it out.

04:24.665 --> 04:28.436
(coughing)

04:28.469 --> 04:29.470
ABRAHAM: Are you okay?

04:29.503 --> 04:31.939
Y-Yeah.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.874
I'm fine. (sniffs)

04:36.577 --> 04:37.545
Jackson.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.812
Jackson, are you all right?

04:38.846 --> 04:39.880
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.615
Really, I'm fine.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.451
We're going to fix this.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.321
(scoffs)

04:50.123 --> 04:52.526
I'm not so sure it can be fixed.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.027
What do you mean?

04:54.061 --> 04:57.698
When Mitch was poking
around inside my head,

04:57.731 --> 04:59.867
I remembered what
happened in Boston,

04:59.900 --> 05:01.635
with my father before we left.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.372
The experiments, the fire.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.006
The ghost gene.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.476
Abe, my father...

05:09.610 --> 05:11.111
injected me with it.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.112
Why?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.347
He must have had a reason.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.817
Maybe he was punishing me.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.753
I don't know what kind of father
does that to their own son.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.189
Jackson.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.358
So you asked me how I'm
doing and the truth is, Abe,

05:24.392 --> 05:26.326
is that I am barely holding on.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.664
It's taking everything I have
to just keep my head straight.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.904
Hey, keeping you in one
piece has always been my job.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.708
Perhaps some things
never change.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.675
(P.A. speaker chimes)

05:41.709 --> 05:43.453
TROTTER (over P.A.): We
got an emergency call

05:43.477 --> 05:46.113
from Allison Shaw.
She wants to talk to Jackson.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.449
Says it's urgent.

05:48.482 --> 05:49.650
Trotter, put her through.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.018
She wants to talk to you.

05:51.051 --> 05:52.553
Alone.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.789
(chirps)

06:02.663 --> 06:05.165
(hissing)

06:05.198 --> 06:07.668
We have to tell Jackson
about his father.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.902
He deserves to know.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.904
But we don't even know
if it is the truth.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.040
Jackson has just found
out that his father

06:13.073 --> 06:14.908
injected him with
the ghost gene.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.810
If Robert Oz is alive,

06:16.844 --> 06:18.746
he's the last person
he would want to see.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.614
If we tell Jackson now,

06:20.648 --> 06:22.049
it could break him.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.084
And I fear we would
never get him back.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.053
(sighs)

06:26.086 --> 06:28.021
Okay. So what do we do?

06:28.055 --> 06:31.024
We find out if Robert Oz
is, in fact, alive.

06:31.058 --> 06:35.429
Until then,
we say nothing of this to Jackson.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.176
ALLISON: Jackson,
there's something that we need to discuss.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.869
It concerns your mother.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.070
What about her?

06:43.103 --> 06:44.938
She was traveling with a group,

06:44.972 --> 06:47.174
fleeing Botswana. I'm aware.

06:47.207 --> 06:50.210
They were due at a checkpoint
in Mozambique three days ago.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.679
They never made it.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.113
What are you saying?

06:54.582 --> 06:57.585
No one's heard from her or
from anyone in her caravan.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.988
Jackson, your mother's missing.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.659
Okay, we are still on the
ground here in Florida.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.661
It'll be hours be...

07:07.695 --> 07:09.930
Allison,
you need to send an IADG team

07:09.963 --> 07:11.098
to find them, now.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.966
Jackson, I'm so
sorry, but there's

07:13.000 --> 07:14.478
no one left to send.
I wish that there was something...

07:14.502 --> 07:15.869
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't care.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.838
You find someone.
You find anyone.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.916
After everything that we have done for
you, don't tell me...

07:19.940 --> 07:21.985
don't tell me that you can't
send a team out there...

07:22.009 --> 07:23.043
(systems powering down)

07:23.076 --> 07:25.112
What the hell?

07:27.147 --> 07:28.982
Jillion dollars in
medical equipment

07:29.016 --> 07:31.151
and we can't afford
to keep the lights on.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.258
(indistinct radio transmissions)

07:38.291 --> 07:39.627
MAN (over radio): Clear.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.129
MAN 2: Target at twelve o'clock.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.797
MAN: Copy.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.033
Oh, hello.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.168
MAN: Down on your knees, now.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.170
Does that line ever
really work for you?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.672
(grunts)

07:56.544 --> 07:58.546
Where is Oz?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.147
Oz?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.683
Oh, the munchkins out
front didn't tell you?

08:02.716 --> 08:05.753
MAN: I'll radio
the perimeter team.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.855
Find Jackson Oz.
Non-lethal rounds.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.890
Davies wants him alive.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.271
MAN: Check the top deck.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.193
(whispering): Listen,
there's four of them on board.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.587
There's more outside.
They're here for me.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.956
I know. (plane engines whirring)

08:45.358 --> 08:46.960
(men shouting) They've
cut main power,

08:46.994 --> 08:49.663
but we still have control
of the critical systems.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.732
Trotter has sealed
himself in the cockpit.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.300
I've told him to
get us airborne,

08:53.333 --> 08:55.535
to stop reinforcements
from boarding.

08:57.705 --> 08:58.782
I wish we had more than tranqs.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.674
We'll be fine.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.586
They'll be using rubber bullets
if they want to take you alive.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.644
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.879
Shaw said that my mother's
caravan has gone missing.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.815
Missing? Outside Botswana.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.216
We have to get to Africa.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.018
If we let Davies'
men take control...

09:11.051 --> 09:12.531
Then it's time to
take back our plane.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.902
(indistinct radio transmission)

09:38.879 --> 09:39.880
Over here!

09:43.884 --> 09:46.053
(grunts)

09:46.086 --> 09:47.721
MAN: Down! Down!

09:49.289 --> 09:51.391
Ugh!

09:51.424 --> 09:52.359
Brown's been hit.

09:52.392 --> 09:55.162
Tango's on the upper level.
Move to flank.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.173
If they get behind us,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.274
we're finished.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.387
Unless I hit them first.
They'll never see it coming.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.013
Cover me! All right, you ready?

10:13.046 --> 10:15.649
Yes. One... two... three!

10:16.784 --> 10:17.417
(grunts)

10:17.450 --> 10:19.086
JACKSON: Abe, go! (grunts)

10:21.722 --> 10:23.623
(men grunting)

10:27.695 --> 10:29.062
Get on the ground, pretty boy.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.701
You wouldn't want to
shoot me this close.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.935
Ruin Davies' prize.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.036
That's not how this works.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.070
I've got the rifle.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.672
(both grunting)

10:47.715 --> 10:48.916
(yells)

10:48.949 --> 10:50.984
(both grunting)

10:55.155 --> 10:56.423
(Jackson yells)

10:58.759 --> 10:59.793
(wood clatters)

10:59.827 --> 11:00.928
(groans)

11:00.961 --> 11:02.996
Where's Davies?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.165
Where is Davies? (groaning)

11:06.233 --> 11:08.468
(grunts)

11:08.501 --> 11:10.370
Hello, Jackson.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.711
♪

11:56.383 --> 11:58.786
It's a good thing the
army ranger wasn't here.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.954
She could've complicated things.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.956
Just find Campbell.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.191
(scoffs)

12:04.224 --> 12:06.126
Triple-Helix animals,

12:06.159 --> 12:07.494
environmental anomalies,

12:07.527 --> 12:09.362
genomic fossils.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.898
You can't be serious.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.901
You want me to explain
it using smaller words?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.144
That research will
lead us to a cure.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.838
When are you going to accept
the fact that there is no cure?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.207
You found your cure once and it failed.
You failed.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.176
The Noah Objective is the only
way to stop the animals now.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.879
SOLDIER: Sir,
you should see this.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.282
Kovacs.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.819
Poor bastard.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.121
Went from a healer to a monster

12:34.154 --> 12:36.323
in a matter of weeks.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.827
This man right here is proof

12:39.860 --> 12:41.537
that we need to stop the
spread of this mutation

12:41.561 --> 12:43.130
by any means necessary.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.535
Before it happens again.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.305
That's right,
I know you've got the mutation.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.041
What I don't know is how or why.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.976
But I got a whole
team of scientists

12:56.009 --> 12:58.211
just waiting to pick you
apart to figure it out.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.248
Okay, Davies.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.115
I'll go with you.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.417
Your men can do
whatever you want to me.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.086
Under one condition.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.254
Jackson, no.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.490
My mother and her caravan are
missing outside of Botswana.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.826
No one knows what's happened.
You send a team for help,

13:12.860 --> 13:14.603
and I will tell Trotter to
land this plane right now.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.397
I will walk out of here with you
without a fight, do you hear me?

13:17.430 --> 13:18.866
I sympathize, Jackson, I do,

13:18.899 --> 13:21.101
but I'm afraid your
mother is a lost cause.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.136
Botswana has all but fallen.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.281
So I suggest that you focus on
the people that you can help.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.439
Namely your team.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.109
Because my men are gonna cut
through that cockpit door,

13:29.142 --> 13:31.411
and they are gonna
land this aircraft.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.147
And what happens then,
what happens to your team,

13:34.181 --> 13:36.349
is entirely up to you.

13:52.465 --> 13:53.901
(static)

13:53.934 --> 13:56.036
(whispers): Trotter.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.437
Trotter.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.506
LOGAN (whispers): The signal's blocked.
(exhales)

13:59.539 --> 14:01.308
Oh, Logan.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.642
Thank God.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.411
Where have you been?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.313
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.924
Davies has some kind of
scrambling device set up.

14:07.948 --> 14:08.916
You can't get anything out.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.183
Well, unless we disable it.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.919
Those are trained
killers down there.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.296
And they already
have everybody else.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.255
There's no fighting this thing.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.490
We need to go.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.160
What are you talking about?

14:22.095 --> 14:23.897
You and I, we need to jump.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.066
Together. Are you kidding me?

14:26.099 --> 14:27.200
We get out of this plane.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.344
We'll go back to South Beach.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.469
Any beach, okay?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.271
I could buy you a drink.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.339
Just come with me now.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.241
Uh...

14:35.442 --> 14:37.144
I'm not jumping out of a plane.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.979
And I'm not leaving my friends.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.280
You should know that.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.287
Yeah, I do.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.226
The scrambler should
be down by the cockpit.

14:55.462 --> 14:56.705
It'll be patched into the comms.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.165
Okay, just follow me.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.534
But don't say I didn't try.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.084
Miss Campbell.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.286
I was starting to
worry we'd lost you.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.454
Nice job, Logan.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.655
You son of a bitch! Jamie...

15:22.689 --> 15:24.391
Ginger's got a mean right.
(yells)

15:24.424 --> 15:25.558
LOGAN: Jamie,

15:25.592 --> 15:26.702
I tried to give
you an out twice.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.671
I thought you would've learned
your lesson in Caraquet.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.796
Why?

15:29.829 --> 15:31.869
Jamie, these days you have
to look out for yourself.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.140
You okay?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.750
You were right,
never should've trusted him.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.742
Hey.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.078
Money's in your account.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.182
(phone beeps)

15:49.216 --> 15:50.083
Yeah, that seems about right.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.185
You opened the door.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.286
I just walked through.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.324
(grunts) (yells)

16:01.761 --> 16:03.396
(both grunting)

16:05.032 --> 16:06.233
That's enough!

16:09.602 --> 16:11.138
Come here.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.706
Get them upstairs.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.009
This op's already taken
longer than it should have.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.450
(quietly): What did you do?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.085
The sloth can tear
the plane apart.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.686
Just go with it.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.088
(grunts)

16:32.259 --> 16:34.727
(seat belts jangling)

16:38.731 --> 16:40.167
It's okay.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.615
(low shrieking)

16:55.648 --> 16:57.184
(rumbling)

16:59.652 --> 17:01.754
(rumbling)

17:05.358 --> 17:07.060
Ouch.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.194
Ow.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.063
Hey!

17:10.097 --> 17:12.199
Could you give me
a little help here?

17:12.232 --> 17:14.267
It's supposed to
be uncomfortable.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.468
Well, look at these bruises.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.769
They're all over.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.106
Oh, we'll have to confirm that.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.073
Don't you dare touch her.

17:20.107 --> 17:22.142
What are you gonna do about
it, Beastie Boy?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.646
(low rumbling and
shrieking resumes)

17:26.679 --> 17:28.348
(loud shriek)

17:36.723 --> 17:38.091
(loud shrieking)

17:43.463 --> 17:44.631
(men yelling)

17:48.835 --> 17:50.437
(shrieking)

17:54.307 --> 17:56.843
(men grunting)

18:01.881 --> 18:03.082
(shrieking continues)

18:07.320 --> 18:08.555
Jamie, look out! (grunts)

18:08.588 --> 18:09.856
(yells)

18:15.728 --> 18:18.231
(grunting)

18:18.265 --> 18:20.500
(men groaning)

18:20.533 --> 18:22.535
JAMIE: Logan's getting away.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.208
(grunts)

18:29.409 --> 18:31.444
(both grunt)

18:31.478 --> 18:32.745
(hissing)

18:35.782 --> 18:37.317
Davies!

18:37.350 --> 18:38.318
(grunts)

18:38.351 --> 18:39.386
(Abraham yells)

18:39.419 --> 18:41.388
Son of a bitch!

18:44.957 --> 18:46.826
Go.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.230
Jamie, where are you going?

18:50.263 --> 18:52.165
To find Logan! The sloth!

18:52.765 --> 18:54.534
(groans)

18:55.868 --> 18:56.869
(loud shrieking)

18:59.772 --> 19:01.208
(shrieking stops)

19:18.658 --> 19:20.193
(grunting)

19:30.437 --> 19:31.771
Stay with me, Davies.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.641
You and I are going to
have a little conversation

19:34.674 --> 19:36.309
about Robert Oz.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.350
(alarm blaring)

19:56.296 --> 19:57.764
JAMIE: The whole time?

19:57.797 --> 20:00.567
You were working for
Davies the whole time!

20:00.600 --> 20:01.868
Come on, Jamie.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.446
I saw the moment that
you changed in Caraquet.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.414
When you held Gwen's arm
and you wouldn't let her go.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.240
In that moment,
you made the choice.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.942
You made the same
choice that I made.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.654
That you're gonna survive
in this new world.

20:11.678 --> 20:12.645
Whatever it takes.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.714
Was any of it real?

20:14.747 --> 20:15.948
I'm sorry.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.451
I really did want to
have a drink with you.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.987
Logan, wait.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.697
You're right.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.899
Whatever it takes.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.474
(tranquilizer dart fires)

20:47.480 --> 20:48.981
Good luck opening your chute.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.586
(plane engine roars)

21:09.502 --> 21:11.338
TROTTER (over P.A.):
Got the power back up.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.773
Comms, too.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.642
(typing on keyboard,
phone rings)

21:15.675 --> 21:16.709
(phone beeps)

21:16.743 --> 21:17.710
Jackson,
what is going on over there?

21:17.744 --> 21:18.854
Did you send a rescue
team to find my mother?

21:18.878 --> 21:22.382
No, I told you,
we're just spread too thin right now.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.215
I'm sorry, but...

21:23.249 --> 21:24.984
No, this is not a
request, Allison,

21:25.017 --> 21:26.719
this is a demand, okay?

21:26.753 --> 21:27.887
We have General Davies.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.656
What?

21:29.689 --> 21:30.523
General Davies
and some hired men

21:30.557 --> 21:33.426
tried to storm our
plane and kidnap me.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.528
But we stopped them.
You stopped them?

21:35.562 --> 21:37.864
Jackson, do you have any
idea what this could mean?

21:37.897 --> 21:39.065
Allison,

21:39.098 --> 21:41.801
If the IADG wants General Davies
to live through the night,

21:41.834 --> 21:44.404
I expect a rescue team
to have found my mother

21:44.437 --> 21:45.905
by the time we
land in Mozambique.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.039
Just think about this

21:47.073 --> 21:48.040
for a second, okay?

21:48.074 --> 21:49.542
You're holding hostages.

21:49.576 --> 21:50.777
You're making demands.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.044
You sound like a terrorist.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.113
If the government
finds out you've taken

21:54.146 --> 21:55.624
a four-star general
hostage, you'll be lucky

21:55.648 --> 21:57.650
if all they do is lock
you up in Guantanamo

21:57.684 --> 21:58.751
for the rest of your life.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.753
I guess we'll be sharing a cell.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.789
After the administration
discovers that

22:02.822 --> 22:04.624
you've been secretly
funding an operation

22:04.657 --> 22:06.459
in opposition of their
very public embrace

22:06.493 --> 22:07.960
of the Noah Objective,

22:07.994 --> 22:09.938
well, I'm pretty sure that
they'll consider that treason,

22:09.962 --> 22:11.431
don't you think, Allison?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.141
Just so we're clear,
if you go down this path,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.535
you're putting everything
that we do here at risk.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.670
Things will never be the same.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.072
Just find my mother
and bring her back.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.107
(phone beeps)

22:21.140 --> 22:22.609
(phone clatters)

22:28.615 --> 22:29.749
(both grunt)

22:29.782 --> 22:31.083
Abe.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.084
You're really doing this.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.786
Yes, I am.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.030
Has he said anything
about Robert Oz?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.389
No.

22:36.423 --> 22:37.189
And I won't.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.526
Even if Robert Oz
was still alive,

22:39.559 --> 22:41.027
what use would I
have for a lunatic

22:41.060 --> 22:44.531
who can't even get a job
teaching high school biology?

22:44.564 --> 22:45.974
We have it on good
authority that that lunatic

22:45.998 --> 22:46.833
is working for you.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.902
Once a reporter,
always a reporter, huh?

22:49.936 --> 22:51.404
Well, there's no story here.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.105
No matter how much
you make me bleed.

22:53.139 --> 22:56.676
Everyone talks, given time.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.977
(both grunting)

23:00.012 --> 23:01.814
I don't know how
much time we have.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.416
(chuckling)

23:03.450 --> 23:04.860
Remember the venom
dealer in Portugal?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.553
Are you serious?

23:06.586 --> 23:07.996
You said it yourself,
we're short on time.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.556
We need answers. Get the venom.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.424
Venom dealer?

23:11.458 --> 23:12.792
Well, that sounds scary.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.896
So, it never occurred
to you that blackmailing

23:16.929 --> 23:18.565
our only ally in Washington

23:18.598 --> 23:20.008
might not be in the best
interest to the team?

23:20.032 --> 23:21.468
I made a decision. Deal with it.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.135
What are you gonna
do if they say no?

23:23.169 --> 23:24.136
You gonna throw
Davies off the plane?

23:24.170 --> 23:25.481
Are you actually crazy
enough now to do that?

23:25.505 --> 23:27.807
You gonna kill him?
How is this any different from the time

23:27.840 --> 23:29.752
that you offered to turn the
Mother Cell over to Reiden

23:29.776 --> 23:31.053
to save Clementine?
Well, I can think of one big difference.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.455
Oh, yeah? What's that?
I didn't go through with it!

23:32.479 --> 23:35.214
That's not even true! Thinking about
betraying the team and doing it,

23:35.247 --> 23:36.215
not the same thing.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.517
JAMIE: Hey!

23:37.550 --> 23:38.651
What going on up there?

23:38.685 --> 23:39.619
Where's Davies?

23:39.652 --> 23:41.521
He's with Abe. What's the plan?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.692
Great,
while you guys figure that out,

23:45.725 --> 23:47.827
I'm gonna go help Abe.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.766
Jackson... I'm done talking.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.767
Me, too.

23:54.801 --> 23:57.003
We got a bigger problem.

24:02.008 --> 24:02.975
Oh.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.811
The lizard could be anywhere.

24:04.844 --> 24:08.581
Which is not good because planes
and ice don't really mix well.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.085
Oh, hey.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.654
Hey, hey.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.628
Is it alive?

24:21.661 --> 24:23.129
Barely.

24:24.931 --> 24:25.898
If this thing dies,

24:25.932 --> 24:26.932
the cure dies with it.

24:28.167 --> 24:32.772
This is the venom of
the inland taipan.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.774
Deadliest snake in the world.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.142
(scoffs)

24:41.848 --> 24:44.183
You are going to tell us

24:44.216 --> 24:46.586
what we want to know,

24:46.619 --> 24:51.090
or I am going to
inject you with it.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.628
Once it enters your bloodstream,

24:55.662 --> 24:56.629
it will feel like

24:56.663 --> 24:59.065
every nerve in your
body is firing at once.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.267
This pain

25:01.300 --> 25:05.271
will only end with antivenom...

25:05.304 --> 25:06.939
or your death.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.542
If I were you,
I'd start talking, General.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.844
Just do it already,
so I don't have to listen

25:11.878 --> 25:14.714
to your endlessly
inane clucking.

25:14.747 --> 25:15.882
Very well.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.753
(Davies grunts)

25:20.787 --> 25:23.222
(breathing heavily and groaning)

25:32.765 --> 25:34.000
Where is Robert Oz?

25:35.802 --> 25:36.769
Go to hell.

25:36.803 --> 25:37.937
We know about the TX gas.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.739
It's gonna kill
2.2 million people.

25:39.772 --> 25:43.309
(strained): It's going
to save seven billion.

25:43.342 --> 25:44.911
It's murder. Murder?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.946
The animals are slaughtering us.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.180
What do you call that?

25:48.214 --> 25:50.049
(yells)

25:50.082 --> 25:51.326
Abe, we got to give
him the antivenom.

25:51.350 --> 25:52.985
No. What?

25:53.019 --> 25:55.021
No.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.223
What does Robert Oz have
to do with any of this?

25:57.256 --> 25:58.658
(groaning)

25:58.691 --> 25:59.992
You are going to die

26:00.026 --> 26:01.327
if you don't you answer me.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.795
Where is Robert Oz?

26:02.829 --> 26:03.930
So...

26:03.963 --> 26:06.599
what if I die?

26:06.633 --> 26:10.970
The TX gas will be my... legacy.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.941
He'll-he'll make sure of that.

26:14.974 --> 26:15.808
Who?

26:15.842 --> 26:17.977
Who do you think?

26:21.413 --> 26:22.381
Robert Oz?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.382
He wanted this?

26:23.415 --> 26:26.285
Wa... wanted it?

26:26.318 --> 26:29.689
The gas, the Noah Objective.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.091
Repopulating the planet

26:32.124 --> 26:33.960
with animals

26:33.993 --> 26:36.663
using clean DNA.

26:36.696 --> 26:39.031
It was all... his idea.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.767
Why? Tell us why!

26:40.800 --> 26:42.268
(guttural groan)

26:44.270 --> 26:45.304
Davies?

26:48.374 --> 26:50.009
Davies!

26:52.011 --> 26:54.714
Abe, give him the antivenom now!

26:54.747 --> 26:56.082
(exhales)

26:56.115 --> 26:57.383
Abe!

27:06.959 --> 27:08.795
He's dead.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.775
(grunting)

27:32.051 --> 27:33.285
JAMIE: Anything?

27:33.319 --> 27:34.921
No.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.288
I'll get the defibrillator.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.690
Hurry. Hurry!

27:39.291 --> 27:41.027
MITCH: Gonna have
to open him up.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.262
See if there's any internal bleeding.
Sure it's safe?

27:43.295 --> 27:46.733
Well, its body temperature
is still within normal range.

27:46.766 --> 27:47.700
Yeah, for now, but happens

27:47.734 --> 27:49.736
when he wakes up and gets
all Mr. Freeze on us?

27:49.769 --> 27:51.714
Unless you want to turn this
plane around and go back...

27:51.738 --> 27:53.672
No, no, no, no,
we have to get to my mother.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.050
Oh, no, no, no.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.084
Crap.

28:06.919 --> 28:07.954
(electricity buzzing)

28:14.260 --> 28:16.328
This lizard is our only shot.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.130
And with the new
protocol, (phone rings)

28:18.164 --> 28:20.767
his DNA is only good to
us when he's still alive.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.169
It's Shaw, I have to take this.
What.. Hey...

28:23.202 --> 28:24.136
I can't do this surgery alone!

28:24.170 --> 28:25.504
Which is why I'll be quick.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.473
(Abe grunting)

28:27.506 --> 28:28.574
Where's the defibrillator?

28:28.607 --> 28:31.243
It's out of commission,
so I got the next best thing.

28:31.277 --> 28:32.144
Ants?

28:32.178 --> 28:33.789
A defibrillator delivers
an electric charge

28:33.813 --> 28:34.914
straight to the heart.

28:34.947 --> 28:38.050
So some electrically charged
ants ought to do the trick.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.786
Do we have a choice?

28:39.819 --> 28:42.121
Tell me you have good news for
me, Allison.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.289
A rescue team is en route.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.091
Thank you. Don't thank me.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.359
I had to falsify
documents to a fake crisis

28:47.393 --> 28:48.828
and lie to a decorated colonel.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.362
If your team finds my mother,

28:50.396 --> 28:52.507
then you will get the general
back when we land in Mozambique.

28:52.531 --> 28:53.499
You have my word.

28:53.532 --> 28:54.777
But right now,
I don't have time for this, okay?

28:54.801 --> 28:57.503
We are about to lose an animal
and our only shot at the cure...

28:57.536 --> 28:58.404
Whatever it is,

28:58.437 --> 29:00.139
I need to speak with
Davies right now.

29:00.172 --> 29:01.917
I need to make sure that
he's still breathing.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.375
Fine.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.543
Jackson?

29:04.576 --> 29:06.846
(electricity crackling)

29:06.879 --> 29:07.890
What the hell is going on here?

29:07.914 --> 29:08.881
Jackson.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.349
Is he dead? Just for a minute.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.152
Use the ants.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.988
(electricity buzzing)

29:16.022 --> 29:17.556
Jackson,
what the hell is going on?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.125
Just hold on a second, Allison.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.426
JACKSON: Okay, now what?

29:20.459 --> 29:22.528
I don't know,
they don't have an on/off switch.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.164
We are gonna lose this
lizard unless we... What the?

29:25.197 --> 29:26.508
Is that Mitch?
Put him on the phone.

29:26.532 --> 29:27.566
What are you doing?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.936
You put him on the phone now.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.139
Someone wants to talk to you.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.406
Uh...

29:34.440 --> 29:36.876
I need to speak with Davies.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.210
(electricity buzzes)

29:40.179 --> 29:42.481
Okay, let me see if I
can wake him up. What?

29:42.514 --> 29:44.483
What's plan B,
'cause it's not working!

29:44.516 --> 29:45.484
What's not working?

29:45.517 --> 29:46.594
MITCH: It's hard to explain.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.287
And harder to imagine.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.856
Phew.

29:49.889 --> 29:50.923
(grunts)

29:53.993 --> 29:55.127
ABRAHAM: He's back!

29:55.161 --> 29:57.496
He's back.

29:57.529 --> 29:58.931
You used

29:58.965 --> 30:00.166
the antivenom.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.968
You coward.

30:02.001 --> 30:06.472
The information you hold is far
more valuable than your life.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.974
Lucky for you.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.608
(wheezing exhale)

30:09.641 --> 30:11.477
Okay, Allison, you heard Davies.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.079
He's alive.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.047
Now find her. (phone beeps)

30:15.081 --> 30:16.415
Jackson?

30:16.448 --> 30:17.616
(dial tone, phone clatters)

30:17.649 --> 30:19.485
I don't know what happened here,

30:19.518 --> 30:22.855
and I don't want to,
but we've got a lizard to save.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.156
So, you, you, come with me.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.191
You, stay here with him.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.959
Try not to kill him this time.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.495
I'll try.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.131
(groans)

30:32.164 --> 30:34.266
(monitor beeping)

30:34.300 --> 30:36.402
Grab that syringe.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.270
Here.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.907
Now, I need you to
drain the bladder.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.975
What?
I've only got two hands here.

30:43.009 --> 30:44.319
They're both wrist-deep
in lizard guts.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.913
Come over here.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.891
See that thing right there,
looks like a little chestnut?

30:48.915 --> 30:49.949
Yeah. Just stick

30:49.982 --> 30:50.950
the needle in there

30:50.983 --> 30:52.151
and pull back on the plunger.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.086
Slowly. All right. There you go.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.189
Beautiful.
All right, that's enough.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.225
Well done, doctor.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.961
Hey. I grabbed the de-icer

31:01.994 --> 31:03.571
just in case our friend
decides to wake up.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.497
Hopefully we won't need it.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.234
Okay, tying off the bleeder.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.237
(lizard snorts) Uh-oh.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.972
Mitch...

31:14.406 --> 31:16.108
JAMIE: That's ice.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.519
Okay, that's enough. Back off.
Just give me a second,

31:17.543 --> 31:20.612
okay? I got it. (ice crackling)

31:20.646 --> 31:22.991
Mitch, I'm not messing around. Back off.
Jackson, you can't do that.

31:23.015 --> 31:24.383
Okay? You're gonna kill him.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.386
(rapid beeping) Guys,
his body temperature's dropping.

31:27.419 --> 31:30.489
Mitch, get away from the ta...
Not now, Jackson!

31:32.624 --> 31:33.926
Ah!

31:35.627 --> 31:37.096
Okay.

31:37.129 --> 31:39.331
Done. Grab the blanket. Go.

31:39.365 --> 31:40.532
Hurry up!

31:42.534 --> 31:43.669
All right.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.304
Here we go.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.705
All right.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.574
JACKSON: I'll get the freezer.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.551
(all panting) JAMIE: Oh.

32:02.188 --> 32:03.322
Anybody want a cold one?

32:03.355 --> 32:05.357
(blows)

32:05.391 --> 32:08.427
(both laughing)

32:08.460 --> 32:12.164
I'll wager that's the first
time since this started

32:12.198 --> 32:15.167
that an animal actually
saved someone's life.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.302
Keep your mouth shut.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.637
Seriously, how many people

32:18.670 --> 32:21.507
do the animals have to
kill before you wake up?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.475
The animals are sick.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.312
When people are ill,
you take them to the doctor.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.414
And when a dog has
rabies, you put it down.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.049
You don't travel
around the world

32:30.082 --> 32:31.383
looking for a magic wand.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.385
You may not like this,

32:33.419 --> 32:36.722
but the Noah Objective is the
only way to protect the people

32:36.755 --> 32:40.059
and save the animals.
Robert Oz said so himself.

32:40.092 --> 32:43.395
I'll believe that when I hear
it come out of his own mouth.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.999
Tell me where he is.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.434
No.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.637
And if you ask me that
question one more time,

32:51.670 --> 32:54.706
when your friend
Jackson comes back,

32:54.740 --> 32:57.676
(scoffs) I'm gonna tell
him your little secret.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.113
(chuckles)

33:02.148 --> 33:04.716
(sighs)

33:04.750 --> 33:06.785
What secret?

33:06.818 --> 33:10.456
That meeting Jackson
in Uwei as a young man

33:10.489 --> 33:11.757
wasn't a coincidence.

33:13.692 --> 33:18.497
That you knew Robert Oz
long before you met his son.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.600
Robert told you that?

33:21.633 --> 33:24.370
(laughs softly)

33:24.403 --> 33:26.272
Actually, you just did.

33:29.575 --> 33:30.576
(sighs)

33:35.347 --> 33:36.482
You okay?

33:36.515 --> 33:39.118
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.420
Did he say anything
about Jackson's dad?

33:48.327 --> 33:51.297
He doesn't know anything.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.418
ABRAHAM: You are going
to leave this plane

34:12.451 --> 34:13.460
without what you came for.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.254
Sounds like something
you should worry about,

34:15.286 --> 34:16.422
not me.

34:16.455 --> 34:17.623
If you want Jackson,

34:17.656 --> 34:19.625
you're going to have
to go through me.

34:19.658 --> 34:22.628
I killed you once.
And I will gladly do it again.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.130
(scoffs)

34:25.164 --> 34:27.333
There's going to
come a day very soon

34:27.366 --> 34:29.201
when you'll come looking for me.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.636
Today is not that day, General.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.603
So get the hell off our plane.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.540
Get.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.118
Ah, Allison.

34:46.152 --> 34:48.254
You look beautiful as always.

34:48.286 --> 34:50.556
You look like the dog's dinner.

34:50.589 --> 34:52.467
Your team may have had
something to do with that.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.226
I believe you're
confused, General.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.194
That's understandable,

34:55.226 --> 34:57.396
given the stress of
surviving a lion attack.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.797
A lion attack?

34:58.830 --> 34:59.865
You were taken hostage

34:59.898 --> 35:03.335
by a group of extremists
when your convoy was overrun

35:03.369 --> 35:04.803
by lions. Is that so?

35:04.836 --> 35:05.804
It is indeed.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.674
And why would I agree
to any of this nonsense?

35:08.707 --> 35:11.143
Because my staff is assembling
a committee to investigate

35:11.177 --> 35:12.778
this little black-ops
mission of yours.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.513
A congressional investigation

35:14.546 --> 35:16.682
would slow the Noah
Objective to a crawl.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.185
(sighs) Don't you think?

35:19.218 --> 35:22.688
Oh, I think even all your red
tape can't delay this, Allison.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.323
I have the international

35:24.356 --> 35:26.858
support I need to make the
Noah Objective a reality.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.327
We'll see.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.362
(scoffs)

35:32.331 --> 35:34.433
Next round of
voting is coming up.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.568
I trust you'll be there?

35:36.602 --> 35:38.704
I look forward to it.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.539
(laughs softly)

35:40.572 --> 35:42.174
SOLDIER: Sir.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.279
I trusted you.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.423
You undermined this mission,

35:48.447 --> 35:49.457
this team, and my authority.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.650
Just tell me where my mother is.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.853
The rescue team
found her caravan.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.322
It was...

35:56.355 --> 35:58.490
Well, there was some
sort of animal attack.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.692
An aid group is still
looking for survivors.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.696
Take me there.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.742
JAMIE: Oh, man.

36:16.775 --> 36:19.778
(sighing): It's even
worse with the lights on.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.414
Oh, don't worry about this.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.415
I don't know if you've noticed,

36:23.449 --> 36:26.785
but our messes seem to
get magically cleaned up

36:26.818 --> 36:30.188
despite the lack of a
crew on this plane. Drink?

36:32.458 --> 36:33.892
Yeah. Sure.

36:35.827 --> 36:36.928
(Mitch groans)

36:36.962 --> 36:38.830
(blows)

36:41.800 --> 36:43.869
Well, thanks for...

36:43.902 --> 36:46.538
helping me save the freeze-y lizard.
Well,

36:46.572 --> 36:47.839
yeah, that's kind of what I do.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.408
Jamie Campbell.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.943
Helper of Saving Stuff.

36:51.977 --> 36:55.514
That what you were
trying to do with Logan?

36:55.547 --> 36:56.948
Help save him?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.654
(sighs)

37:02.688 --> 37:04.690
Listen, I don't blame you
for trusting that guy.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.534
Especially when you...
you probably thought you had to.

37:06.558 --> 37:09.261
Stop.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.662
All I'm saying... Just stop.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.399
You don't have a
fraction of a clue

37:13.432 --> 37:14.833
what I had to do to survive.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.835
That's true.

37:16.868 --> 37:20.739
Because you haven't really been
sharing, have you?

37:21.907 --> 37:24.410
Well, what difference would that
make, exactly?

37:24.443 --> 37:27.946
I mean, you've been cocooned
in this flying Ritz-Carlton.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.849
You don't have a clue what's
actually happening out there.

37:33.552 --> 37:36.054
True again.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.124
But is it so wrong for me
to want to look out for you?

37:42.994 --> 37:44.830
You don't need to
look out for me.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.466
If you want to protect someone,
go be with your daughter.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.938
Wow.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.774
You're gonna make this about
Clementine now, really? No, no.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.309
It's about you.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.444
And me. This, this...

37:58.477 --> 38:00.455
If I don't have a fraction
of a clue about something,

38:00.479 --> 38:01.813
it's what this even is.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.882
Well, yeah,
that makes two of us.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.817
(glass shatters)

38:07.353 --> 38:09.421
Don't worry,
I'm sure somebody will clean it up.

38:19.030 --> 38:19.998
(bird caws)

38:20.031 --> 38:20.999
(men speaking Swahili)

38:21.032 --> 38:22.501
More bodies here.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.341
(man speaks indistinctly)

38:39.017 --> 38:41.019
ALLISON: Did you
know these people?

38:41.052 --> 38:42.554
ABRAHAM: Yes.

38:42.588 --> 38:45.357
They're from
Elizabeth's village.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.092
Jackson, these bodies...

38:47.125 --> 38:50.529
they look like the people
Kovacs killed in Patagonia.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.734
Hujambo. Hujambo.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.002
Are there any survivors?

38:57.035 --> 38:59.070
In the med tent over there.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.089
Is there no one else?

39:18.123 --> 39:20.091
I'm sorry.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.836
Jackson.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.704
Dede, have you seen my mother?

39:34.840 --> 39:36.842
Have you seen Elizabeth?

39:38.644 --> 39:39.911
What happened here?

39:40.946 --> 39:42.648
Dede, it's okay.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.583
We were sleeping,

39:44.616 --> 39:46.785
I heard screams of terror.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.820
Everyone was dead.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.657
Elizabeth ran into the woods.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.725
What did this?

39:58.630 --> 40:00.532
Your mother.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.069
She did.

40:04.102 --> 40:08.073
She killed all of them.
