00:07.519 --> 00:10.480
What happened when the host
of Frogger parked illegally

00:10.519 --> 00:11.759
outside the studio?

00:11.800 --> 00:13.119
His car got "toad".

00:13.160 --> 00:14.560
- Get it?
- Mm-hmm.

00:14.599 --> 00:17.160
"Toad"?

00:17.199 --> 00:17.879
Tonight...

00:17.920 --> 00:19.239
Get ’em going!

00:19.280 --> 00:20.519
Whoa!

00:20.559 --> 00:21.519
No way!

00:21.559 --> 00:22.600
Yes, way!

00:22.640 --> 00:23.920
Frogger’s back!

00:23.960 --> 00:25.600
Yeah... I’m good.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.120
And it’s wetter...

00:27.160 --> 00:27.679
Uh-oh.

00:27.719 --> 00:28.679
Wilder...

00:28.719 --> 00:30.719
Ow! Oh my God!

00:30.760 --> 00:32.679
And bitier...

00:32.719 --> 00:33.880
Here we go.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.159
Than ever before.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.640
[slurred]
Pedestrian coming through.

00:36.679 --> 00:37.880
Ped-eth-trian?

00:37.920 --> 00:40.320
He’s protecting his teeth,
Wayans!

00:40.359 --> 00:40.880
Sorry.

00:40.920 --> 00:41.759
Only the best...

00:41.799 --> 00:43.600
Oh! Down!

00:43.640 --> 00:45.000
Will battle their way

00:45.039 --> 00:47.759
to the Boss Toad
Bonus Round.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.840
And she’s off and
she is, oh!

00:49.880 --> 00:51.320
That is how you
play Frogger.

00:51.359 --> 00:52.320
Yeah!

00:52.359 --> 00:55.600
Up for grabs,
it’s cool...

00:55.640 --> 00:56.479
My man.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.479
Wow.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.880
It’s stuffed with cash.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.840
Ah! It’s crazy!

01:00.880 --> 01:03.560
It’s the Golden Fanny Pack.

01:03.600 --> 01:06.680
[screams]

01:06.719 --> 01:09.319
- I’m Damon Wayans Jr.
- I’m Kyle Brandt.

01:09.359 --> 01:11.560
- And this is "Frogger".
- And this is "Frogger".

01:16.120 --> 01:18.840
Tonight, six Froggers
will leap lily pads,

01:18.879 --> 01:21.319
hop highways and
splash through swamps.

01:21.359 --> 01:24.920
By the end, our top frog
will win $10,000 cash

01:24.959 --> 01:27.120
It’s anyone’s to win,
and it’s anyone’s to lose.

01:27.159 --> 01:29.319
Why, technically,
it’s Boss Toad’s to lose

01:29.359 --> 01:31.920
since that dude runs
the final crossing.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.920
Yeah, he’s not actually
our boss, though, right?

01:33.959 --> 01:35.599
He pays my salary.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.799
[Boss Toad growls]

01:37.840 --> 01:39.480
Oh.

01:39.519 --> 01:42.640
Tonight’s first Froggers are
also going to find themselves

01:42.680 --> 01:46.920
in troubled waters as
they head to Ribbit River.

01:46.959 --> 01:48.719
Froggers must pass
the powerful jets

01:48.760 --> 01:50.159
of the waterfall.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.519
Then call for the turtles and
jump a ride to the logs

01:52.560 --> 01:55.359
or take a tough shortcut through
the spinning lilies.

01:55.400 --> 01:58.079
Once they traversed the up and
down loco lilies,

01:58.120 --> 02:01.239
Froggers ride the gators
and scale the rocks

02:01.280 --> 02:03.480
before swinging home
to the landing pad.

02:03.519 --> 02:07.239
Look at the beautiful crossing.
Just captivating.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.159
It’s almost romantic.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.840
You got a turtle there.

02:11.879 --> 02:14.919
You’ve got some cattails.
Looks like a screensaver.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.840
Look at the little ducks
in the background.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.000
Oh, that’s beautiful,
look at that.

02:18.039 --> 02:20.080
- So slow.
- Migrators?

02:20.120 --> 02:20.919
Best duck impression?

02:20.960 --> 02:22.919
I can do mating ducks.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.759
And the floor is yours.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.240
[imitates mating ducks]

02:30.960 --> 02:32.560
[laughing]

02:33.960 --> 02:39.080
First up, we’ve got
Kylee versus Ayana.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.240
My name is Kylee Smith.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.879
I’m 26 years old.
I’m from Alpharetta, Georgia

02:43.919 --> 02:47.080
and I’m a professional
basketball player.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.719
My nickname is
Basketball Barbie.

02:50.759 --> 02:53.520
Mainly because I am super girly.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.560
I’ve been playing Frogger
my whole life,

02:55.599 --> 02:59.719
so there’s no-one or nothing
standing in my way.

02:59.759 --> 03:03.120
I’m Ayana, I’m 27 years old.

03:03.159 --> 03:05.159
I live in Chicago, Illinois,

03:05.199 --> 03:07.840
and I’m a professional dancer
and circus artist.

03:07.879 --> 03:11.599
People underestimate me because
I’m a 4’11" girl,

03:11.639 --> 03:15.479
but I am small and mighty
and I will bend, flip,

03:15.520 --> 03:18.120
crawl, climb,
leap my way through this course.

03:18.159 --> 03:21.319
And I am so competitive,
I will not give up.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.479
They should be
watching their backs.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.919
Here we go, folks.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.680
5’11" versus 4’11".

03:27.719 --> 03:29.319
What an even match-up.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.439
Sure.

03:30.479 --> 03:31.919
Ready, Frogger 1?

03:31.960 --> 03:34.240
Here we go.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.520
All right, Ribbit River
welcomes Kylee Smith.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.280
From the great state
of Georgia, 5’11".

03:40.319 --> 03:43.879
Basketball playing,
pink loving Frogger.

03:43.919 --> 03:47.400
Welcome to the teeth
of Jason Waterfall,

03:47.439 --> 03:49.000
our resident monster.

03:49.039 --> 03:52.479
That extra height she has
could give her the winning edge.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.080
Jump or use the rope.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.280
Anything to get her
safely on the other side

03:56.319 --> 03:59.120
while being thrashed
by the water cannons.

03:59.159 --> 04:01.800
Down on that low post,
feed her the ball.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.000
She’s calling for it.

04:03.039 --> 04:04.759
Okay!
I can do this!

04:06.400 --> 04:07.719
- Oh!
- Jeez!

04:07.759 --> 04:09.199
Is she okay?

04:09.240 --> 04:10.680
Oh, she might have
broke the thing.

04:10.719 --> 04:11.560
That was nuts!

04:11.599 --> 04:12.919
Hey... oh!

04:12.960 --> 04:14.719
She’s holding on!
She’s holding on!

04:14.759 --> 04:16.319
Is she alive?

04:16.360 --> 04:18.319
Now this is where the water
cannons start to take a toll.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.160
She will be blasted off.

04:20.199 --> 04:21.519
I got it, got it, got it,
got it, got it.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.800
Yes, yes...

04:22.839 --> 04:25.240
Oh! Down!

04:25.279 --> 04:28.399
Whistle the waterfall
for a flagrant two.

04:28.439 --> 04:31.680
So she jumps literally
organs first.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.879
Yep. Liver first.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.680
Watch, it’s a steady low stream

04:35.720 --> 04:38.319
and then just when you think
you’ve got it down, boom.

04:38.360 --> 04:39.160
Up high.

04:39.199 --> 04:40.600
This was the taller of the two.

04:40.639 --> 04:42.000
Imagine if that was Ayana.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.079
How would that have gone?

04:43.120 --> 04:44.759
Like a golf ball on a tee.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.000
Ayana, I hope
you’re taking notes.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.600
She would have skipped
like a rock.

04:47.639 --> 04:49.439
* I have what it takes *

04:49.480 --> 04:50.959
Oh, I like that.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.600
All right, ready, Frogger 2?

04:53.639 --> 04:54.519
Ready!

04:54.560 --> 04:56.040
Here we go.

04:56.079 --> 04:57.959
Here comes Ayana Strutz,
trying to strut

04:58.000 --> 05:00.399
her way through
Jason Waterfalls.

05:00.439 --> 05:03.279
Her body and her life
are about twisting

05:03.319 --> 05:04.839
into a pretzel, and
we’ve got some rolled gold

05:04.879 --> 05:06.519
right in front of us.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.519
I have the shortest legs!
How am I supposed to do this?

05:09.560 --> 05:12.360
Look forward to this replay,
I will say that.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.199
What replay are
you referring to?

05:14.240 --> 05:15.639
- [laughing]
- How dare you?

05:15.680 --> 05:18.480
We only do replays when
they fall into the water, Damon.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.839
Are you new here?

05:19.879 --> 05:22.120
Okay. You know what?
I’m gonna make it.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.040
I’m gonna reach for it.

05:23.079 --> 05:24.519
I think this is a mistake.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.199
That’s for people with legs
longer than that.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.240
Okay.

05:28.279 --> 05:29.360
Imagine what she’s thinking.

05:29.399 --> 05:31.600
A Frogger one foot
taller than her

05:31.639 --> 05:33.000
just got her eye blasted out.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.720
She’s made the neon bridge...

05:35.759 --> 05:36.879
Oh!

05:36.920 --> 05:39.759
- Down goes Ayana.
- Shucks.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.480
Oh my gosh.

05:41.519 --> 05:42.879
Smacktacular.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.480
Shout-out to the scrunchy
staying on her head.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.560
They don’t make ’em
like they used to.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.439
Let’s see that again.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.199
It’s like
she presented her head.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.160
She was like, would you
like to...

05:52.199 --> 05:54.279
Thank you, sir.

05:54.319 --> 05:56.800
Kylee opting for the goggles
after losing and replacing

05:56.839 --> 05:59.160
her contact lens
after her first crossing.

05:59.199 --> 06:00.920
This is high stakes stuff here.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.399
Oh, gosh, she is
a violent jumper.

06:03.439 --> 06:05.920
She lands directly on
the rib cage every time.

06:05.959 --> 06:08.199
She does not care
about her sternum.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.480
Every time she does that,
it hurts me.

06:10.519 --> 06:11.680
It hurts me, too.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.279
I saw the wind
get knocked out of you.

06:13.319 --> 06:15.680
Sacrifice the body sometimes
the name of the game.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.920
Now, it should be easy for her
to grab the rope because

06:17.959 --> 06:19.240
of the 5’11" frame.

06:19.279 --> 06:20.839
She’s in the
driver’s seat, folks.

06:20.879 --> 06:21.879
I got this.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.560
She can swing across the rope.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.600
She gets to dry land if she
can only focus.

06:26.639 --> 06:27.519
All right.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.040
One more swing!

06:29.079 --> 06:30.920
If we cross the waterfall,
you’re not home free.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.199
But you’re tap-dancing--

06:32.240 --> 06:33.319
Oh, she abandons the rope
and gets it.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.120
Get ’em going!

06:37.160 --> 06:40.720
Kylee Smith, welcome
to the next stage.

06:40.759 --> 06:42.279
Waterfall in the rearview,

06:42.319 --> 06:43.800
it’s got to feel good,
weight off the shoulders.

06:43.839 --> 06:46.920
That’s probably the hardest
part of this crossing.

06:46.959 --> 06:48.600
That might be the hardest
part of Frogger,

06:48.639 --> 06:49.600
I really mean that.

06:49.639 --> 06:50.759
Let’s go!

06:50.800 --> 06:52.160
Seems a little
nervous right now.

06:52.199 --> 06:53.560
This one’s it, this one’s it.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.879
Remember, she had
a vision crisis here.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.000
Can she focus on Tony?

06:57.040 --> 06:58.319
Oh, yes!
Oh, no.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.319
Oh, oh, uh-oh.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.199
Strength, strength.
Pull herself up.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.160
Come on, you’ve got a great
grip on the finger grooves.

07:03.199 --> 07:05.040
Wayans, can she pull
herself up?

07:05.079 --> 07:06.920
I think she can... ooh.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.000
- Oh, boy.
- And she’s down.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.800
Too much body in the bayou.

07:10.839 --> 07:12.720
Kylee Smith, great run.

07:12.759 --> 07:14.600
Tony the turtle, though,
got her.

07:14.639 --> 07:16.800
- Woo!
- You’ve got this.

07:16.839 --> 07:18.439
Chicago, Illinois’ Ayana Strutz

07:18.480 --> 07:19.720
coming back for a second life

07:19.759 --> 07:22.439
like Jordan’s sport
in the 45.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.240
I hate water!

07:23.279 --> 07:25.240
She just said I hate water.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.240
Great show to come on
if you hate water.

07:27.279 --> 07:29.759
It’s like the zoologist
who hates animals

07:29.800 --> 07:31.439
and the nanny who
can’t stand kids.

07:31.480 --> 07:32.639
You got it, you got it.

07:32.680 --> 07:35.839
Somehow that left foot
needs to join the party.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.199
There she goes,
and she’s on it.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.519
There we go, there we go.
There we go, yes!

07:38.560 --> 07:40.199
On to the rope!
She reached up to the rope.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.959
This is clutch. Can we get
to the third stepping stone?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.199
Ayana came to play.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.680
- Oh, my!
- Dry land!

07:46.720 --> 07:48.319
We got dry land!
Mating call.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.959
[screams]

07:52.000 --> 07:53.319
Ha! That’s a good mating call.

07:53.360 --> 07:54.360
- I’m familiar with that one.
- Yeah.

07:54.399 --> 07:55.839
Okay, that works.

07:55.879 --> 07:57.480
On to little rock now.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.480
- Good job, good work!
- Oh, wow! Hello.

07:59.519 --> 08:02.920
Wayans and I need an MRI
just watching Ayana.

08:02.959 --> 08:05.000
How do I get on
that thing?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.240
Tony’s all like,
get over here.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.360
Hop on, Ayana.

08:08.399 --> 08:11.120
And she’s off,
and she’s golden.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.759
No, you’re not coming
for me this time.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.319
Okay, ow!

08:14.360 --> 08:15.920
Oh my God!

08:15.959 --> 08:17.639
- That looked like it "hoit"!
- Ooh!

08:17.680 --> 08:20.199
And she’s aggressive, going
right to the lily pad shortcut!

08:20.240 --> 08:23.399
Ayana takes a lead,
a commanding lead.

08:23.439 --> 08:25.480
Now she’s got the log,
my friend.

08:25.519 --> 08:27.279
This is a six foot jump

08:27.319 --> 08:29.399
for a person less than
five feet tall.

08:29.439 --> 08:31.519
Oh my God, I’m going to
get dizzy on here.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.320
This is a tough one.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.799
Woo!

08:33.840 --> 08:35.759
Look out, she’s going to get
rocked off the turntable!

08:35.799 --> 08:37.320
Sneak up on ya.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.559
That was perfect.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.559
And she does it!

08:40.600 --> 08:42.159
Hey!

08:42.200 --> 08:43.480
Woo-hoo-hoo!

08:43.519 --> 08:44.639
Take that!

08:44.679 --> 08:45.960
That might be the
greatest jump

08:46.000 --> 08:48.320
these Frogger eyes
have ever seen.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.960
She may finish the
whole thing now,

08:50.000 --> 08:50.840
I’m not kidding.

08:52.759 --> 08:54.399
Oh, but this is a long jump.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.559
And now the loco lilies,
which are going to be tough

08:56.600 --> 08:57.799
for her, Wayans.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.759
Rising eight feet
out of the water,

08:59.799 --> 09:01.600
it’s all about timing

09:01.639 --> 09:03.480
and clearing that huge gap.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.799
Eh... Wow.

09:08.840 --> 09:09.879
Wow.

09:09.919 --> 09:10.879
Are you kidding me?

09:10.919 --> 09:12.039
- Yes!
- She’s up!

09:12.080 --> 09:13.320
- Wingspan!
- I love her.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.440
I love her.

09:14.480 --> 09:16.120
- 4’11" and still going!
- I love her.

09:16.159 --> 09:17.240
Ooh.

09:17.279 --> 09:18.360
What she’s got to do is
she’s got to get

09:18.399 --> 09:19.919
to the top of the
loco lily,

09:19.960 --> 09:22.000
then she has an eight foot
jump into the next one.

09:22.039 --> 09:24.519
Eight foot jump?
That’s two of her, almost.

09:24.559 --> 09:25.799
Absolutely, you’re right.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.559
Okay, okay.
Come on down, come on down.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.720
Just go, just go,
just go, just... yeah!

09:29.759 --> 09:30.919
Beautiful.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.399
- Yas queen.
- Yas queen indeed.

09:33.440 --> 09:37.639
Look at that frog just going,
"Oooh!"

09:37.679 --> 09:39.279
Keep going.

09:39.320 --> 09:40.080
This is scary!

09:40.120 --> 09:42.840
Okay, okay, this is... whoa.

09:42.879 --> 09:44.759
No way!

09:44.799 --> 09:47.320
That goes eight feet over
the surface of the water.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.440
If she falls, she is going
to plummet.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.320
I’m for real
going to throw up.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.519
[chuckles]

09:53.559 --> 09:55.120
And she’s off!

10:03.639 --> 10:05.960
If she falls, she is
going to plummet.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.240
And she’s off...

10:10.279 --> 10:12.039
Oh!

10:12.080 --> 10:14.120
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

10:14.159 --> 10:15.679
Human contortionist,

10:15.720 --> 10:19.720
she just went into a full
lowercase h, I think that was.

10:19.759 --> 10:21.360
For help.

10:21.399 --> 10:22.440
[laughing]

10:22.480 --> 10:24.519
Kylee’s on her last life now.

10:24.559 --> 10:27.080
She has to get to
the infamous loco lilies

10:27.120 --> 10:29.240
or she is done.

10:29.279 --> 10:31.200
And...

10:31.240 --> 10:33.440
- We’re playing now.
- Oh, look at that.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.440
I think that hurt Tony.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.679
It might have.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.799
And already, she’s on
to the spinning lily.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.840
Okay!

10:38.879 --> 10:40.320
She’s a foot taller than Ayana,

10:40.360 --> 10:43.000
so this jump might be easier
for her.

10:43.039 --> 10:45.840
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.000
Easy!

10:47.039 --> 10:48.440
Hey, easy, tigress.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.279
I got this.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.440
Woo!

10:50.480 --> 10:51.799
Boom!

10:51.840 --> 10:54.559
I wonder if she’s going to try
her same technique,

10:54.600 --> 10:55.639
the sternum jump.

10:55.679 --> 10:58.360
Yeah, she’s going to do
two-handed leap

10:58.399 --> 10:59.320
and she is off.

10:59.360 --> 11:00.799
And she is down.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.159
- Wait...

11:02.200 --> 11:03.320
- No, she’s alive!
- She’s not down!

11:03.360 --> 11:04.600
In for the fight of her life.

11:04.639 --> 11:07.360
She lives.
This is an infamous position

11:07.399 --> 11:09.440
at this exact point.
seen it a hundred times.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.720
Get your knee up.

11:10.759 --> 11:12.320
Never seen a 5’11" Frogger
try it though.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.320
She might have an advantage.
Go, go gadget arms.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.200
Now pull yourself up, Kylee.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.399
Oh boy, can she do it?

11:18.440 --> 11:19.320
She needs a jetpack
at this point.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.879
Oh...

11:21.919 --> 11:24.279
It’s okay, girl.
That was a good fight.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.240
If you’re going to lose,
that’s how you lose.

11:26.279 --> 11:29.200
Sometimes when you lose,
you really win.

11:30.399 --> 11:31.639
- Not today.
- Not today, though. No, no.

11:31.679 --> 11:33.240
I have won it!

11:33.279 --> 11:34.879
No doubt about it,
today the super small

11:34.919 --> 11:36.879
beat the super tall.

11:36.919 --> 11:39.559
Congratulations to Ayana,
who knocks out Kylee to become

11:39.600 --> 11:41.480
today’s first Frogger into
the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

11:41.519 --> 11:42.879
Who will be joining her
to battle it out

11:42.919 --> 11:45.519
for the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack?

11:45.559 --> 11:47.399
We’re about to find out.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.679
Good news for the best
pizza in the Froggerverse.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.279
We’re off to Frog City.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.200
After crossing Hopper’s Highway

11:55.240 --> 11:57.120
and engaging the crosswalk
signal,

11:57.159 --> 11:58.840
Froggers must leap
to the Croaklyn Bridge,

11:58.879 --> 12:00.840
and pass the Thunder Truck

12:00.879 --> 12:02.399
to order a pizza.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.240
Running a gauntlet
of drifting cars

12:04.279 --> 12:06.600
and ramming vans
to collect their pizza,

12:06.639 --> 12:10.039
it’s a final taxi hop
to the landing pad.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.200
Oh, yes finally
it is here.

12:12.240 --> 12:13.919
Piping hot pizza,
I’ve been hungry.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.480
I’m just going to dive
right into this thing, Wayans.

12:16.519 --> 12:17.159
Mmm.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.440
Like my pizza, man?

12:18.480 --> 12:19.679
No, actually,
I ordered out.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.440
This is from our competition.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.440
Want some?

12:22.480 --> 12:23.679
Can I have a second?

12:23.720 --> 12:25.879
- Can I have a moment?
- It’s come to that.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.240
I also went to Damon’s
comedy show

12:27.279 --> 12:29.440
and I... pulled up another
coming on my phone

12:29.480 --> 12:30.559
in the middle of a set.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.039
[Damon sobbing]

12:32.080 --> 12:35.360
He was really funny.

12:35.399 --> 12:38.200
It’s Blazia versus Bryan.

12:40.879 --> 12:42.519
I’m Blazia.

12:42.559 --> 12:45.639
I’m 32 years old from
San Clemente, California.

12:45.679 --> 12:48.080
And I teach yoga.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.879
My favorite yoga pose
is frog pose

12:50.919 --> 12:53.480
because it slightly
tortures everybody

12:53.519 --> 12:55.200
and I get a slight
joy out of that.

12:55.240 --> 12:59.039
I can win Frogger because
not only am I flexible,

12:59.080 --> 13:02.240
I also have that
mental capacity.

13:02.279 --> 13:03.679
I’ve got the mindfulness.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.159
I’m prepared.
I’m definitely gonna win it.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.480
My name is Bryan.
I’m 31 years old

13:08.519 --> 13:11.440
from San Francisco, California,
and I’m a data scientist.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.080
I’m definitely a nerd,
but also like I was

13:13.120 --> 13:15.200
kinda gifted physically.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.080
I’m happiest on the
baseball field, you know.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.720
When I’m in-between those
two chalk lines,

13:18.759 --> 13:21.440
there’s not a care in the world
other than the game at hand.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.840
When people first look at me,
they’re like, Bryan, nerd.

13:23.879 --> 13:27.840
But they don’t see that
really competitive, sporty side.

13:27.879 --> 13:30.200
Usually I’m crunching the
numbers, but this time

13:30.240 --> 13:32.320
I’m going to be crunching
the competition.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.039
This is so cool.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.720
I’m so excited.

13:35.759 --> 13:36.840
For sure.

13:36.879 --> 13:38.360
Ready, Frogger 1?

13:38.399 --> 13:41.159
- I’m ready.
- Here we go.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.120
Blazia Lyster, welcome
to our little world

13:44.159 --> 13:45.519
we call Frog City.

13:45.559 --> 13:47.399
Headband game on point.
Beautiful.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.360
I think that Pantone
color is Smurf.

13:50.399 --> 13:51.440
Yeah.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.759
It’s a dead ringer
for Smurf.

13:52.799 --> 13:54.639
Made it.
Made it to the first one.

13:54.679 --> 13:55.480
Oh, okay, now what?

13:55.519 --> 13:56.759
Now what do I do?

13:56.799 --> 13:58.240
On Hopper’s Highway
there’s some serious

13:58.279 --> 14:00.120
road rage going down.

14:00.159 --> 14:03.240
Traveling at 15
feet per second,

14:03.279 --> 14:06.159
it’s all about timing
and Blazia’s going to have

14:06.200 --> 14:07.480
to be quick on her feet.

14:07.519 --> 14:08.799
Ooh, ooh, okay.

14:08.840 --> 14:09.679
After the blue one.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.360
Ah!

14:11.399 --> 14:14.320
Oh, no!
Smurf-- oh, she’s down.

14:14.360 --> 14:15.240
Ow.

14:15.279 --> 14:17.639
Shot right to the mid-section.

14:17.679 --> 14:19.639
Seems to be okay,
she’s got a lot of spirit.

14:19.679 --> 14:22.000
You’re right, man,
it’s never over on Frogger.

14:22.039 --> 14:24.639
Until the other person wins.

14:24.679 --> 14:26.240
Ready, Frogger 2?

14:26.279 --> 14:27.240
Ready as can be.

14:27.279 --> 14:28.519
Here we go.

14:28.559 --> 14:30.120
All right, safety first here
as Bryan

14:30.159 --> 14:31.480
puts in his mouth guard.

14:31.519 --> 14:33.200
You can’t really
blame him, Damon.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.440
Data analyst, he’s done some
analysis right here.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.320
All right, whoa, boy.
Oh, no, no.

14:37.360 --> 14:38.320
Oh, oh, okay.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.840
Bryan alive.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.960
He’s got to get over, of course,
to that crosswalk button.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.720
I feel like we’re in for an
adventure right here, Wayans.

14:44.759 --> 14:45.759
Seven foot jump again.

14:45.799 --> 14:46.759
I like his jumps.

14:46.799 --> 14:48.440
Lot slipperier than I thought.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.039
This is no problem here.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.240
Like a pro right there.

14:51.279 --> 14:53.399
[slurred]
Pedestrian coming through.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.440
Ped-eth-trian?

14:54.480 --> 14:57.399
He’s protecting his teeth,
Wayans!

14:57.440 --> 14:58.720
Sorry.

14:58.759 --> 15:00.440
He’s also from a town
called Walnut, California.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.039
You can crack a crown
on those things.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.360
So dental safety,
a priority for him.

15:04.399 --> 15:06.440
All right, another
seven-foot jump.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.320
Does he get nervous
in front of the 5-0?

15:08.360 --> 15:09.600
Absolutely not.

15:09.639 --> 15:10.720
Going good.

15:10.759 --> 15:12.159
Croaklyn Bridge!

15:12.200 --> 15:13.759
- There it is.
- Oh boy. Oh boy.

15:13.799 --> 15:15.399
- Boom!
- Oh, wow!

15:15.440 --> 15:17.639
Five and a half feet wide,
12 feet long.

15:17.679 --> 15:19.639
Uh-oh, and he’s sliding.

15:19.679 --> 15:21.039
That bridge goes at
45 degree angles,

15:21.080 --> 15:22.320
can he get on to the lily?

15:22.360 --> 15:23.440
All right! Bryan’s playing here.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.600
Okay, Bryan.

15:24.639 --> 15:25.919
- This guy right here.
- What about him?

15:25.960 --> 15:27.559
He’s got the goods.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.320
Woo.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.080
Bryan, meet Thunder Truck.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.320
All right, Bryan!
Fast!

15:33.360 --> 15:35.159
Bryan is doing
the damn thing.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.840
Guess I gotta go
make a phone call.

15:36.879 --> 15:38.440
Order my pizza.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.000
It’s only one inch that
he can put those feet on.

15:41.039 --> 15:43.240
Can he get to the hotline?

15:43.279 --> 15:45.240
Definitely skinnier.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.559
He’s got a lot of
knee showing.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.200
Beautiful royal blue
right up to the knees.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.440
Love that close-up
of the "k-nees".

15:50.480 --> 15:52.120
Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.120
- Hold on.
- Whoo!

15:53.159 --> 15:56.080
I kind of like the socks now.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.240
[phone rings]

15:57.279 --> 15:59.879
Hello, Pizza Rana.
Please hold.

16:02.679 --> 16:04.399
I’m going to go home
and shower, is that cool?

16:04.440 --> 16:06.639
Yeah, go ahead,
shower, take a nap.

16:06.679 --> 16:08.240
Watch "Titanic" a few times.

16:08.279 --> 16:09.919
It’s fine, you got time.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.279
Hello?

16:20.720 --> 16:21.480
Hello?

16:21.519 --> 16:22.799
Hey, man.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.039
What’s up, Damon?
I’d like to order a pizza.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.039
Frog City pizza.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.200
We’re back, sorry.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.399
We had a lot of orders.
What do you want?

16:28.440 --> 16:31.159
I’d like to order
a pizza please.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.360
Extra flies for
some protein.

16:33.399 --> 16:37.519
Well we have the freshest flies
and the freshest pies.

16:37.559 --> 16:39.279
Amazing!

16:39.320 --> 16:40.679
You can hang up now.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Beautiful royal blue right
up to the knees.

16:45.039 --> 16:46.559
Love that close up.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.840
Bryan, honesty, I didn’t think
he had this in him.

16:49.879 --> 16:50.759
Back on the lily pad.

16:50.799 --> 16:51.759
I’m glad you said that.

16:51.799 --> 16:53.080
Bryan overachieving right now

16:53.120 --> 16:54.720
on to the lily pad,
but it get serious.

16:54.759 --> 16:58.960
It goes to R-rated here
with the Fast and the Froggiest.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.639
Look out, they’re
200 pounds each,

17:00.679 --> 17:03.080
and they’re coming
for Brian Lim,

17:03.120 --> 17:05.519
the pride of where?
Walnut, California.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.240
That’s a lot further
than it looks.

17:08.279 --> 17:09.799
Oh, that’s like a big jump.

17:09.839 --> 17:11.519
Six foot jump
to the lily pad,

17:11.559 --> 17:12.559
He’s got it.

17:12.599 --> 17:13.160
All right.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.079
And now, timing.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.599
This thing spins at
15 feet per second.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.000
And you will go into the water
at least three times that fast.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.720
Here he goes, one,
two, three, get off!

17:22.759 --> 17:24.359
Down!

17:24.400 --> 17:26.359
A brief hesitation
is all it takes,

17:26.400 --> 17:28.319
and Bryan’s going swimming.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.279
He froze on the last lily pad.

17:30.319 --> 17:33.160
We’re going to see this.
It’s classic.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.920
You cannot do this on Frog City.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.440
He looked behind.
No.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.759
[chuckling]

17:38.799 --> 17:40.200
I like that he tried to lay
a shoulder into the car

17:40.240 --> 17:41.960
as if he was going
to win that battle.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.759
The cars are undefeated.
You’re a frog!

17:44.799 --> 17:47.160
Bryan, that’s a car, buddy.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.720
Blazia’s on life two.

17:48.759 --> 17:50.680
And we got gridlock
here on Hopper’s Highway.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.960
Blazia Lyster,
that’s a fun name to say.

17:53.000 --> 17:53.960
Say it, Wayans.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.119
- Blazia Lyster.
- Blazia Lyster.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.039
Blazia Lyster.

17:58.079 --> 18:01.559
She says she’s equal
parts beach girl and cow girl.

18:01.599 --> 18:03.160
You know who doesn’t
like the beach?

18:03.200 --> 18:05.839
- Hmm?
- Cows.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.039
Ah!

18:07.079 --> 18:08.079
She’s on to the Croaklyn
Bridge...

18:08.119 --> 18:10.160
- And...
- She’s down.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.440
Listen, the bridge
is no joke.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.359
45 degree angle
down into the water,

18:13.400 --> 18:16.000
that was like a little
waterslide, wasn’t it?

18:16.039 --> 18:20.160
The yoga instructor doing
her downward dolphin position.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.559
Down into the water,

18:21.599 --> 18:23.519
we love ya, Blazia.
That’s two lives now.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.160
Bryan Lim.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.079
If he can finish
on this life, that’s it.

18:32.119 --> 18:33.200
He wins.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.880
I think he’s got it.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.440
And we saw this before.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.759
You don’t jump and stop,
jump and stop.

18:38.799 --> 18:42.599
You got two sprints
to get to the third pad

18:42.640 --> 18:44.640
in front of you,
then you take a breath.

18:44.680 --> 18:45.960
You just go.

18:46.000 --> 18:46.960
It’s a flow baby.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.759
You go one, two,
now get off!

18:48.799 --> 18:49.960
Yes!

18:50.000 --> 18:51.599
Well done, Bryan.

18:51.640 --> 18:53.680
Six foot leap here
for Bryan Lim.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.079
The double foot release ala
Charles Barkley in the 90s.

18:56.119 --> 18:57.519
Oh, that was great.
Wow, man.

18:57.559 --> 18:59.400
This guy’s got the goods.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.440
And now it’s van city.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.599
This is tough.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.799
The Jean Claude Ram Vans
just sitting there,

19:04.839 --> 19:06.759
saying come and get it,
Bryan.

19:06.799 --> 19:09.160
This is not a big gap.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.720
I think the gap between
his shorts and socks

19:10.759 --> 19:12.559
is the same as between
the vans here.

19:12.599 --> 19:14.359
We have arrived
at symmetry.

19:14.400 --> 19:17.200
Maybe its a sign
from the Frogger gods.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.559
As soon as this thing goes back,
I’m making a run for it.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.160
Woo!
Uh-oh.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.680
- Can he get the pizza?
- Oh, he got it.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.359
Bryan’s playing!

19:25.400 --> 19:26.880
- He timed it perfectly!
- Yes!

19:26.920 --> 19:28.440
Beautiful Frogger right there.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.599
That’s what you’re
supposed to do.

19:29.640 --> 19:30.720
Absolutely beautiful.

19:30.759 --> 19:31.759
That’s how you play.

19:31.799 --> 19:33.880
Bryan Lim is
two bounds away

19:33.920 --> 19:35.680
from finishing this thing.

19:35.720 --> 19:36.960
Definitely going to jump
on the tops here.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.279
They look like
the most stable.

19:38.319 --> 19:39.440
All right, now we should tell
you at home,

19:39.480 --> 19:41.000
the cabs are
extremely wobbly.

19:41.039 --> 19:42.960
Whoa!
Whoa-ho.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.319
I gotta say,
I underestimated Bryan.

19:45.359 --> 19:47.559
I underestimated Bryan.
I did.

19:47.599 --> 19:49.319
I don’t think I have to jump.

19:49.359 --> 19:51.599
Oh, they’re like floating.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.319
He’s going down
to the hood of the cab.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.640
Wow.

19:54.680 --> 19:56.160
He’s seeing how much room
there is for his feet.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.759
And his socks.

19:57.799 --> 19:59.160
Oh, he’s going that way.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.599
He’s going to crawl
this thing,

20:00.640 --> 20:01.680
and I like it.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.000
We always tell them
to stay low.

20:03.039 --> 20:05.079
Bryan Lim!

20:05.119 --> 20:06.119
Oh, baby!

20:06.160 --> 20:07.759
Pretty good.

20:07.799 --> 20:09.599
- Come on!
- Bryan...

20:09.640 --> 20:12.359
One giant leap for
knee-high socks!

20:12.400 --> 20:14.960
- He’s got it!
- Yes! Yes!

20:15.000 --> 20:16.759
All right!

20:16.799 --> 20:17.960
Woo-hoo!

20:18.000 --> 20:19.960
Bryan Lim,
take a bow, my friend!

20:20.000 --> 20:21.079
You crushed it!

20:21.119 --> 20:23.960
Well done, Bryan,

20:24.000 --> 20:27.759
Congratulations to the man,
the myth, the legend, Bryan.

20:27.799 --> 20:29.359
So who will be joining him
to battle it out

20:29.400 --> 20:31.759
for the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack?

20:31.799 --> 20:33.359
We’re about the find out.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.759
Up now, Frogs in Space.

20:36.799 --> 20:38.680
Bouncing to the craters,

20:38.720 --> 20:40.960
Froggers will climb the
satellite to start

20:41.000 --> 20:42.400
the launch sequence.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.160
They’ll have to leap from
the second satellite

20:44.200 --> 20:45.759
to the spinning space amphibian,

20:45.799 --> 20:48.000
dodge the space jets,

20:48.039 --> 20:49.559
and inch around
the galaxy hopper

20:49.599 --> 20:51.079
before facing
the space worms

20:51.119 --> 20:53.680
on their way to
the landing pad.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.559
It’s Jess versus Crystal.

20:57.599 --> 20:59.359
My name is Jessica Curl.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.319
I’m 33 years old, I’m from
Bismarck, North Dakota,

21:02.359 --> 21:04.480
and I’m a trainer and a coach.

21:04.519 --> 21:07.119
I own a gym.
We’re a dog-friendly gym.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.640
I think people actually join
the gym

21:08.680 --> 21:10.119
so they can pet the dogs.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.880
Which is really cool.

21:11.920 --> 21:13.079
I played professional soccer.

21:13.119 --> 21:14.920
It’s taken me all
over the world.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.240
I look really friendly
on the outside,

21:17.279 --> 21:19.359
but once I get to
the starting line, it’s over.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.680
To my opponent,
I’ve got one thing to say:

21:21.720 --> 21:23.359
go hard, or go home.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.279
Because I’m gonna bring it.

21:25.319 --> 21:28.480
I’m Crystal, 38,
from Houston, Texas.

21:28.519 --> 21:31.000
I’m a pole and dance
fitness instructor

21:31.039 --> 21:32.359
and performer.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.200
Internationally,
I’ve got a couple of medals

21:34.240 --> 21:35.279
clink, clink.

21:35.319 --> 21:36.680
Uh... but I’m not here to brag.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.440
I think I can win Frogger

21:38.480 --> 21:41.160
simply because I can
defy gravity

21:41.200 --> 21:42.720
at any given time.

21:42.759 --> 21:46.559
I’m a little pocket-sized
power house.

21:46.599 --> 21:48.000
I’m here for this.

21:48.039 --> 21:51.119
What else it there
but to take first place?

21:51.160 --> 21:53.400
All right, Wayans,
we love this stuff.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.160
This is the second crossing
this evening

21:56.200 --> 21:59.839
where we’ve got a battle
of height versus might.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.559
Ready, Frogger 1?

22:01.599 --> 22:02.599
Ready.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.400
Here we go.

22:04.440 --> 22:07.839
Dog loving gym owning
Jess Curl.

22:07.880 --> 22:09.440
Bismarck, North Dakota.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.039
All right, she gets right
to the rocket booster,

22:12.079 --> 22:13.720
and attempts and she does it.

22:13.759 --> 22:16.920
Jess Curl who was just
seemingly born

22:16.960 --> 22:18.400
to live and work
in a gym with that name.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.480
You got it, bud.

22:19.519 --> 22:21.640
Does she hesitate?
Not for a second.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.920
Jess Curl is here to play
a distinct height advantage,

22:24.960 --> 22:26.319
six-inch height advantage

22:26.359 --> 22:27.799
over Crystal Belcher.

22:27.839 --> 22:29.759
It will serve her well on
Satellite X here, Wayans.

22:29.799 --> 22:31.960
See, that’s when
the height comes in handy.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.359
Absolutely.

22:33.400 --> 22:34.720
Woo.

22:34.759 --> 22:36.400
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

22:36.440 --> 22:38.640
Hey! Turn it up! Let’s go!

22:38.680 --> 22:41.400
We’re seeing a repeating pattern
on this course.

22:41.440 --> 22:42.920
- Just go.
- Yes.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.440
Just go!

22:44.480 --> 22:47.480
The jump to that five...
and she’s got it! No problem.

22:47.519 --> 22:48.119
Woo!

22:48.160 --> 22:49.279
<i>T-minus five.</i>

22:49.319 --> 22:51.799
Come on, good vibes!
Save lives!

22:51.839 --> 22:54.559
Let’s go!

22:54.599 --> 22:57.759
The bravery, the courage,
the strength.

22:57.799 --> 22:59.359
That’s what Frogger is about.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.160
Sorry, my voice is a little...

23:01.200 --> 23:02.720
When I get excited,
it goes up.

23:02.759 --> 23:04.279
I heard you do that, yeah.

23:04.319 --> 23:05.319
[high pitched voice]
It’s what Frogger’s about!

23:05.359 --> 23:06.519
Yeah!

23:06.559 --> 23:10.240
And here come the
space amphibians.

23:10.279 --> 23:12.799
These spinning suckers
take no prisoners.

23:12.839 --> 23:17.759
It is a five-foot jump
for Jess to land on their backs.

23:17.799 --> 23:21.759
The great humbler of
men and women on this course.

23:21.799 --> 23:23.880
Can Jess Curl stand in the face

23:23.920 --> 23:27.200
and get to the spinning
space amphibian?

23:29.400 --> 23:30.759
[grunts]

23:41.559 --> 23:42.680
[grunts]

23:42.720 --> 23:43.559
Oh!

23:43.599 --> 23:44.720
- Oh ho!
- That was a great jump.

23:44.759 --> 23:46.480
- That was a bulls-eye.
- Wow, man.

23:46.519 --> 23:49.279
Dead center, the confidence
is surging.

23:49.319 --> 23:51.319
See? Long legs, man.

23:51.359 --> 23:53.079
Jess Curl completely
fearless.

23:53.119 --> 23:54.480
Second space amphibian.

23:54.519 --> 23:56.279
Wayans, this is
unbelievable.

23:56.319 --> 23:57.720
We don’t see this
on Frogs in Space.

23:57.759 --> 23:58.880
It doesn’t happen.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.480
Her height is really
helping her right now.

24:00.519 --> 24:02.559
I feel like
she’s getting taller.

24:02.599 --> 24:05.079
She’s about 6’3" now.

24:05.119 --> 24:06.319
Oh my gosh, number four!

24:06.359 --> 24:08.079
<i>- T-minus four.</i>
- Light it up!

24:08.119 --> 24:10.160
<i>Space station now activated.</i>

24:10.200 --> 24:13.920
Three to go and
welcome to the doors.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.400
Uh-oh! We got problems!

24:16.440 --> 24:19.279
She got clocked
by that cannon.

24:19.319 --> 24:20.599
Oh my goodness.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.119
Jess Curl, that core strength,
that lower body,

24:23.160 --> 24:26.039
and now she deals with
the golden doors.

24:26.079 --> 24:27.519
- Boom!
- Wow.

24:27.559 --> 24:28.720
Great job.

24:28.759 --> 24:29.279
Uh-oh.

24:29.319 --> 24:31.319
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

24:31.359 --> 24:32.480
- Got it.
- Golly.

24:32.519 --> 24:33.720
Confidence, here we go.

24:33.759 --> 24:36.599
This is awesome,
the final space amphibian.

24:36.640 --> 24:38.119
Another lily pad,
and then we get

24:38.160 --> 24:41.240
into the space worms,
and then through the numbers,

24:41.279 --> 24:43.079
and on to the red
launching button,

24:43.119 --> 24:45.640
and she has dropped perfection.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.599
Oh...

24:47.640 --> 24:48.799
It’s like you want
her to make it

24:48.839 --> 24:50.119
but you don’t want
her to make it.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.880
cause you want to be
able to win, ah!

24:51.920 --> 24:52.720
It’s crazy!

24:52.759 --> 24:54.039
Ah!

24:54.079 --> 24:55.839
Four jumps remaining.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.880
Space worms don’t even
bother her,

24:57.920 --> 24:58.920
like a fly swatted away.

24:58.960 --> 24:59.920
And here we go!

24:59.960 --> 25:01.720
Got to pull up.

25:01.759 --> 25:04.119
This is dangerous,
she’s up.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.079
<i>T-minus three.</i>

25:05.119 --> 25:06.680
[panting]

25:06.720 --> 25:08.920
I cannot believe what we are
seeing, ladies and gentlemen.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.400
Okay.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.200
Only the two and the one
and the red launch button.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.039
<i>T-minus two.</i>

25:13.079 --> 25:15.519
Two, no problem, Damon.

25:15.559 --> 25:17.039
Here we go.

25:17.079 --> 25:19.359
We’re at the five yard line,
about to cash this thing in.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.000
<i>T-minus one.</i>

25:21.039 --> 25:22.559
Wow.
Go to the one.

25:22.599 --> 25:25.880
Last jump remaining, it is
an eight foot gargantuan leap.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.920
It’s getting real, it’s getting
real, it’s getting real,

25:27.960 --> 25:29.039
it’s getting real

25:29.079 --> 25:30.680
Composing herself,
focusing.

25:32.119 --> 25:34.880
One of the biggest jumps we have
ever seen, ladies and gentlemen.

25:34.920 --> 25:37.599
First ballot hall of fame
jumper if she can land it.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.359
- She is off, and she’s gotta--
- No!

25:39.400 --> 25:40.960
- She is down!
- [laughing]

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
Oh my goodness,
she had it,

25:44.039 --> 25:44.960
- and fell.
- Wow.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.079
Shock and awe in Frogs in Space.

25:47.119 --> 25:50.200
I don’t believe what
we just saw.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.160
Well, she had it.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.559
She landed on
the launch button,

25:54.599 --> 25:56.319
and just slipped and
had nothing to grab onto.

25:56.359 --> 25:57.880
We still got a random foot
sticking out there.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.279
Look at that.

25:59.319 --> 26:00.720
It’s like she’s still
hanging on.

26:00.759 --> 26:02.640
Crystal Belcher.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.440
She needs to get
all the way

26:05.480 --> 26:07.559
to the very, very end.

26:07.599 --> 26:08.960
Welcome to Frogs in Space.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.240
All you need to do is cross
the entire thing,

26:11.279 --> 26:13.880
and you’ll be fine.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.480
Ready, Frogger 2??

26:15.519 --> 26:16.920
Ready!

26:16.960 --> 26:19.160
Here we go.

26:23.319 --> 26:25.440
Crystal Belcher, the pride
of Sugarland, Texas.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.480
And she’s going already!

26:26.519 --> 26:27.759
- Wow! Wow!
- Oh my gosh!

26:27.799 --> 26:29.759
Crystal Belcher, you are
already a legend.

26:29.799 --> 26:30.799
Woo!

26:30.839 --> 26:32.240
Off to a blistering
pace, Wayans.

26:32.279 --> 26:33.480
Jeez Louise, man.

26:33.519 --> 26:35.440
That was like a straight
double jump.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.039
And she’s not stopping.

26:37.079 --> 26:38.799
She is already onto the
second space rocket booster.

26:38.839 --> 26:41.079
I think she thinks this is a
race, and I’m here for it.

26:41.119 --> 26:43.279
There is no slowing
this cat down.

26:43.319 --> 26:46.400
Now, only 5’2", this is going
to be a tough reach for her.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.200
to start the launch sequence.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.559
But she is on there
like a squirrel!

26:50.599 --> 26:51.880
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

26:51.920 --> 26:53.079
This is incredible!

26:53.119 --> 26:54.640
- She is halfway home.
- All right.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.960
Good, well done,
well done!

26:57.000 --> 26:59.279
She doesn’t have height,
but she has speed

26:59.319 --> 27:00.799
and a clear fearlessness.

27:00.839 --> 27:03.119
- And she’s off and--
<i>- T-minus five.</i>

27:03.160 --> 27:04.279
No problem!

27:04.319 --> 27:05.759
- Was so easy for her.
- Wow!

27:05.799 --> 27:08.240
Red five standing by.

27:08.279 --> 27:10.279
We have already started
the launch sequence.

27:10.319 --> 27:11.880
Wayans, we may have
a time record here.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.200
Hmm...

27:13.240 --> 27:14.880
A pole fitness expert,
she knows how

27:14.920 --> 27:16.279
to transfer her bodyweight.

27:16.319 --> 27:17.839
Well done, well done.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.759
Crystal came to play!

27:19.799 --> 27:23.000
This woman came to
pliggity play.

27:23.039 --> 27:24.599
Absolutely, couldn’t
have said it better,

27:24.640 --> 27:26.599
or stranger,
but I like it.

27:26.640 --> 27:27.839
All right.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.039
We’re now going to try
to make that jump

27:29.079 --> 27:30.240
to the spinning space amphibian.

27:30.279 --> 27:31.599
You got this.

27:31.640 --> 27:32.279
Pole dancing, what you
really need right now

27:32.319 --> 27:33.680
is a pole vault.

27:33.720 --> 27:34.599
Big breath, big breath.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.359
And she’s off and she is-- oh!

27:37.400 --> 27:38.359
- Wow.
- That was awkward.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.880
Can she recover?
She does!

27:39.920 --> 27:42.160
Not bad, seen many
a face plant there.

27:42.200 --> 27:43.680
Yes, we have.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.880
This time, this time!

27:44.920 --> 27:48.440
And the second space amphibian,
is no problem.

27:48.480 --> 27:49.839
Oh, wow. Oh, my gosh.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.240
Remember, that
space amphibian she’s jumping on

27:51.279 --> 27:52.480
is very unsteady.

27:52.519 --> 27:55.480
It is not solidified,
it’s a wobbler.

27:55.519 --> 27:56.440
Come on.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.480
She’s doing this so fast.

27:58.519 --> 28:00.440
- It’s incredible.
<i>- T-minus four.</i>

28:00.480 --> 28:02.160
Stop what you’re doing
and watch Crystal Belcher

28:02.200 --> 28:03.920
play Frogger.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.480
<i>Space station now activated.</i>

28:05.519 --> 28:07.480
It’s astonishing,
we’re still doing her intro.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.359
Give us some bio nuggets before
she finishes this thing, Wayans.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.400
As a kid, she shaved a chunk
out of her hair,

28:12.440 --> 28:13.920
trying to copy
Salt-n-Pepa.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.440
So, uh... hopefully she’ll
push it to the limit.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.680
Hey, and she does!

28:17.720 --> 28:18.519
Hey!

28:18.559 --> 28:19.519
She got knocked a little bit.

28:19.559 --> 28:21.440
Remember, she’s small,

28:21.480 --> 28:22.839
one of these little pushes
could get her in,

28:22.880 --> 28:24.680
- and she’s still alive!
- She saved herself!

28:24.720 --> 28:26.720
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

28:26.759 --> 28:28.720
Time for damn worms.

28:28.759 --> 28:30.319
I’m already kind of sad

28:30.359 --> 28:31.839
that we’re going to
lose one of these Froggers.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.039
It’s not right.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.079
Both of the women
are warriors.

28:34.119 --> 28:35.680
Step.

28:35.720 --> 28:36.839
Oh!

28:36.880 --> 28:38.440
- Wait, wait, wait!
- We got to fight!

28:38.480 --> 28:40.279
We gotta fight!
Can she pull herself up?

28:40.319 --> 28:42.039
Crystal Belcher will
not be denied!

28:42.079 --> 28:43.039
She is still alive!

28:43.079 --> 28:44.160
Okay.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.359
Four jumps remaining.

28:45.400 --> 28:47.559
And this thing is over
if she finishes.

28:48.920 --> 28:50.480
She’s on to three!

28:50.519 --> 28:51.880
<i>- T-minus three.</i>
- She’s alive! Light it up!

28:51.920 --> 28:53.920
Only the two and the one
and the red launch button.

28:53.960 --> 28:54.880
Two more!
Two more!

28:54.920 --> 28:57.519
Crystal Belcher, you legend.

28:57.559 --> 28:59.079
Two... Okay.

28:59.119 --> 29:00.640
- 5’2"
- Yes!

29:00.680 --> 29:02.759
Sugarland, Texas,
I cannot believe

29:02.799 --> 29:04.880
what we are seeing,
ladies and gentlemen.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.839
Two jumps remaining.

29:06.880 --> 29:09.200
What is... this is like Frogger
all-stars.

29:09.240 --> 29:10.440
This is unbelievable.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.079
- And light it up.
- T-minus one.

29:12.119 --> 29:13.319
- Phew.
- You got it.

29:13.359 --> 29:14.880
Too easy!
Too easy!

29:14.920 --> 29:17.440
Can she launch the rocket?

29:17.480 --> 29:19.440
That red button is all
that is left.

29:19.480 --> 29:23.240
Wayans can barely even
look and I don’t blame him.

29:23.279 --> 29:25.279
Let’s go, last one!

29:25.319 --> 29:27.279
Here it goes.
That’s a huge jump.

29:27.319 --> 29:29.279
It’s the biggest jump on
the course by far.

29:29.319 --> 29:32.240
Ladies and gentlemen,
Crystal Belcher is off...

29:32.279 --> 29:33.319
And she’s on!

29:33.359 --> 29:34.640
Now we got it!

29:34.680 --> 29:35.880
Launch the rocket!

29:35.920 --> 29:39.440
You are moving on to
the Boss Toad Bonus Round,

29:39.480 --> 29:40.799
Crystal, great job!

29:40.839 --> 29:42.000
Ah!

29:42.039 --> 29:43.880
And we’ve got it, folks.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.240
That’s my bud.

29:45.279 --> 29:47.240
Proof that size doesn’t
always matter.

29:47.279 --> 29:51.000
She is now the final Frogger
through to

29:51.039 --> 29:53.720
the Boss Toad Bonus Round,
and what a showdown we got.

29:53.759 --> 29:56.079
Who is going to take home
the Golden Fanny Pack, guys?

29:56.119 --> 29:58.200
Let’s find out.

30:09.640 --> 30:14.839
They say he’s
a failed hand model.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.680
He once auditioned for
The Voice,

30:17.720 --> 30:21.519
and not a single chair turned.

30:21.559 --> 30:25.119
He was born with facial hair.

30:25.160 --> 30:29.440
He is Boss Toad.

30:31.839 --> 30:32.440
That’s Boss Toad.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.680
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

30:33.720 --> 30:35.720
Oh, and he’s eating garlic.

30:35.759 --> 30:37.799
[flatulence]

30:37.839 --> 30:41.640
- Oh!
- Can somebody light a candle?

30:41.680 --> 30:43.279
What’s worse is that
he’s frognapped

30:43.319 --> 30:45.559
five froglets,
and hidden them

30:45.599 --> 30:47.799
across the most challenging
Frogger crossing of them all,

30:47.839 --> 30:49.319
the Boss Toad Temple.
It happened.

30:49.359 --> 30:50.720
Only one of the Froggers can
take home the

30:50.759 --> 30:52.200
$10,000 Golden Fanny Pack
tonight.

30:52.240 --> 30:56.519
The question is, which one of
them can beat Boss Toad?

30:56.559 --> 30:58.200
In the Boss Toad round.

30:58.240 --> 30:59.680
our Froggers each get
five minutes

30:59.720 --> 31:02.480
to rescue those froglets,
as many as they can.

31:02.519 --> 31:03.839
Froggers start in the middle
of the crossing,

31:03.880 --> 31:06.079
and they can choose
any route they want

31:06.119 --> 31:07.680
to get the job done.

31:07.720 --> 31:08.960
But they only have one life,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
so if they fall in, game over.

31:11.039 --> 31:15.119
Facing Boss Toad tonight,
Crystal Belcher!

31:15.160 --> 31:18.680
AKA The CEO of the Pole.

31:18.720 --> 31:23.279
’80s day-glo fan and
Frogger’s smallest,

31:23.319 --> 31:27.960
mightiest contortionist,
Ayana Strutz.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.799
But first up, the Stats Boss,
who beat the Ram vans,

31:32.839 --> 31:37.519
Bryan Lim as his
long blue socks.

31:37.559 --> 31:39.400
Bryan, my friend.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.759
Yeah, Damon!

31:40.799 --> 31:43.079
The rules are simple,
five minutes,

31:43.119 --> 31:45.279
five froglets,
one life.

31:45.319 --> 31:47.079
I think I got the
formula figured out.

31:47.119 --> 31:49.160
I’m gonna factor the
Froggers out of the equation.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.000
[Boss Toad growls]

31:51.039 --> 31:52.799
Say what?

31:52.839 --> 31:54.119
All right!

31:54.160 --> 31:55.240
Here we go.

31:58.279 --> 32:00.000
All right, Bryan’s got an
athleticism and a little bit

32:00.039 --> 32:03.039
of a Daredevil streak.
Can he tap into that thing here?

32:03.079 --> 32:04.960
That lily pad is moving!

32:05.000 --> 32:06.319
And it’s not that close.

32:06.359 --> 32:08.559
He’s already facing a big jump.

32:08.599 --> 32:11.039
He’s 5’9", so sort of
modest height here

32:11.079 --> 32:12.640
for our male Froggers.

32:12.680 --> 32:14.359
Can he complete this jump?
He’s certainly taking his time.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.720
Heave-ho, broad jump, and ooh!

32:16.759 --> 32:17.960
Nice.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.200
Two foot landing, okay.

32:19.240 --> 32:22.079
Into the mouth of
the Venus frog trap.

32:22.119 --> 32:23.160
I’m impressed.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.200
Come on. Come baby froggy.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.880
Frog number one.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.079
Careful, careful.

32:28.119 --> 32:29.599
Bryan, I’d get out of
these real quick.

32:29.640 --> 32:33.200
Those fly traps haven’t
eaten for a while.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.400
All right.

32:34.440 --> 32:35.799
The clock is ticking.

32:35.839 --> 32:37.720
Toss and leave or
go up on the beach, Wayans?

32:37.759 --> 32:39.519
He’s going to toss and follow.

32:39.559 --> 32:43.039
All right, there’s the toss.

32:43.079 --> 32:44.480
Change your wikipage.

32:44.519 --> 32:47.640
Wayans got it right and
Bryan Lim is on the scoreboard.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.000
Oh my goodness,
that was fast.

32:51.240 --> 32:52.839
Oh! Yeah, Bryan.

32:52.880 --> 32:53.799
Come on, Bryan.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.799
All right, gonna
go back this way.

32:55.839 --> 32:58.240
He conquered Frog City,

32:58.279 --> 33:00.559
and now we got to take
down Toad Temple.

33:00.599 --> 33:02.160
Off to a good start.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.000
It’s the same eight foot jump,
but this next lily pad

33:05.039 --> 33:08.000
is half the size and
way harder to land on.

33:11.319 --> 33:13.200
Whoa!

33:13.240 --> 33:14.920
- Oh!
- Oh, Bryan!

33:14.960 --> 33:17.440
Oh no!

33:17.480 --> 33:19.359
Bryan Lim is finished.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.000
Total shock.

33:21.039 --> 33:23.200
Bryan only one froglet
on the scoreboard.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.680
Will that be enough?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.079
All right, here’s a replay.

33:26.119 --> 33:28.200
Big jump, too much momentum.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.799
Too much forward momentum.

33:29.839 --> 33:30.799
Splash.

33:30.839 --> 33:34.359
And then also the socks
add a good

33:34.400 --> 33:35.799
you know, five to ten pounds.

33:35.839 --> 33:37.039
- Shackles, basically.
- Yeah.

33:37.079 --> 33:39.119
Ooh!

33:39.160 --> 33:40.599
All right, this is heating up.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.319
Crystal’s next to play.

33:42.359 --> 33:44.759
You need to rescue two
or more froglets,

33:44.799 --> 33:48.519
or rescue one froglet but
faster than Bryan.

33:48.559 --> 33:50.200
Are you ready to
play some Frogger?

33:50.240 --> 33:52.519
All right, she likes
’80s mix tapes,

33:52.559 --> 33:55.359
let’s hope this tape
does not include "Footloose",

33:55.400 --> 33:58.200
"Free Fallin’", "Another one
Bites the Dust".

33:58.240 --> 34:00.559
Ready, Frogger?
Here we go.

34:06.200 --> 34:10.039
Crystal does an about face
and goes towards the bassinets.

34:10.079 --> 34:11.920
Here she goes.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.360
- Wow.
- Wow!

34:13.400 --> 34:14.800
Oh, what a jump!

34:14.840 --> 34:16.840
Understand, if she gets
this froglet now and

34:16.880 --> 34:19.400
beats 43 seconds,
Bryan is out.

34:19.440 --> 34:20.559
She’s already got it in hand.

34:20.599 --> 34:21.880
I love that she did this.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.079
Wow.

34:23.119 --> 34:24.559
She could’ve gone for two
the slow way,

34:24.599 --> 34:25.800
There you go.
There you go.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.400
We’re down to about 10,
15 seconds.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.880
We’re very close
to Bryan’s time.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.559
Open, please.

34:30.599 --> 34:32.320
That’s what happens
when I go first.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.000
Gets my strategy.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.880
Here we go.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.440
Flying squirrel.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.400
- Already, park it. Park it.
- Hold on. Hold on.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.400
That’s it.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.599
It’s probably going to
beat Bryan.

34:42.639 --> 34:45.039
Nothing is ever certain
in Toad Temple.

34:46.719 --> 34:49.320
I like how she’s using
the Venus frog trap

34:49.360 --> 34:50.239
Absolutely.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.800
She knows she’s small.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.599
She’s like how do I get here
without risking it all?

34:54.639 --> 34:55.920
Ooh!

34:55.960 --> 34:58.679
Wow.

34:58.719 --> 35:01.840
I think that first froglet
really shot up her confidence.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.239
She’s looking to take
down a bunch of them.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.519
Man, she is ripped in
those biceps.

35:04.559 --> 35:06.119
She is so strong.

35:06.159 --> 35:08.400
This is a big seven foot jump

35:08.440 --> 35:10.199
onto Harriet the hippo.

35:10.239 --> 35:12.679
All right, hungry hippo.

35:12.719 --> 35:13.760
[grunts]

35:13.800 --> 35:15.320
Oh, what a jump.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.119
Hello, knees.

35:17.159 --> 35:18.400
[Damon laughs]

35:18.440 --> 35:20.559
The hippo has been
messing people up.

35:20.599 --> 35:24.000
The hippo has been messing
small people up specifically.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.000
I know.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.400
Oh!

35:26.440 --> 35:28.480
I think she hit
her face right there.

35:28.519 --> 35:30.400
Crystal’s taking punishment.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.800
- She is a battle ax!
- Absolutely.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.000
Crystal’s good.

35:33.039 --> 35:35.840
Crystal’s got real, natural
Frogger talent.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.000
Nice, nice.

35:39.039 --> 35:40.800
Rounding the two minute mark,

35:40.840 --> 35:43.719
Bryan Lim can only watch,
and Ayana will be next.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.400
Buddy, you ready for a ride?

35:45.440 --> 35:47.679
- Crystal is composed.
- I like this.

35:47.719 --> 35:48.599
I do, too.

35:48.639 --> 35:49.599
Okay.

35:49.639 --> 35:51.000
Takes is out of the
burlap diaper.

35:51.039 --> 35:54.800
Classic thigh pinch technique.
I assume, yes.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.599
[chuckles]

35:55.639 --> 35:57.760
Hopper Chopper 1000.

35:57.800 --> 35:59.639
She deserves a hero shot,
don’t you think, Wayans?

35:59.679 --> 36:00.480
Woo!

36:00.519 --> 36:02.800
Wow, she’s having fun.

36:02.840 --> 36:05.119
Oh!

36:05.159 --> 36:06.599
Wee!

36:06.639 --> 36:08.480
Ooh!

36:08.519 --> 36:12.280
- Smooth.
- Wow.

36:12.320 --> 36:13.559
Crystal takes the lead,

36:13.599 --> 36:14.800
and looking to add to it.

36:17.039 --> 36:18.280
All right.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.519
This is high stakes stuff, here.

36:19.559 --> 36:22.320
Open says me.
We’re back.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.960
She jumps off and
she’s in business.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.360
[grunts]

36:26.400 --> 36:27.719
Now she has made her bed,

36:27.760 --> 36:28.880
The best she will finish with

36:28.920 --> 36:30.360
with the amount of
time remaining

36:30.400 --> 36:31.880
is three froglets.

36:31.920 --> 36:32.920
Got a rain shower.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.719
She can get that froglet
on the turtle,

36:34.760 --> 36:36.639
but time’s becoming a factor

36:36.679 --> 36:37.760
because she’s got to get back.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.639
Okay.

36:38.679 --> 36:40.199
You got it!
You got this!

36:40.239 --> 36:42.079
Great jumping, Crystal.

36:42.119 --> 36:43.719
Smooth operator,
right there.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.960
Riding on alligators.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.519
Jumping on frogs.

36:49.559 --> 36:51.239
The journey back to
Gilligreen’s Island

36:51.280 --> 36:53.199
takes at least 30 seconds.

36:53.239 --> 36:55.519
She’s got to cover
a lot of ground.

36:55.559 --> 36:57.039
Maybe I misjudged this.

36:57.079 --> 36:58.880
Nearing the five minute mark,
Wayans, at this point

36:58.920 --> 37:00.519
we’re due for
a desperation throw.

37:00.559 --> 37:02.559
Clock is ticking.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.519
Nervous face right there.
I don’t blame her.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.920
Can she make the jump?

37:18.559 --> 37:21.039
- Nervous face right there.
- Yeah.

37:21.079 --> 37:21.920
I don’t blame her.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.039
Can she make the jump?

37:24.079 --> 37:25.599
Ooh!

37:25.639 --> 37:26.840
She’s got a fight,
she’s still alive.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.159
- Held on.
- Oh! No way!

37:30.199 --> 37:32.400
And she’s holding on.

37:32.440 --> 37:34.280
Come on, pull yourself up.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.880
How did she do that?

37:35.920 --> 37:36.840
You got it!

37:36.880 --> 37:38.119
Yes!

37:38.159 --> 37:40.320
And there it is.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.440
Time is up,
that’s five minutes.

37:42.480 --> 37:43.639
Baby!

37:43.679 --> 37:46.119
- Gutsy run.
- Great effort.

37:46.159 --> 37:48.760
Two froglets in five minutes.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.039
She’s number one right now.

37:50.079 --> 37:51.639
- She’s in the lead,
- In the lead.

37:51.679 --> 37:55.840
And now we are down
to our final Frogger, Ayana.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.000
- Ayana
- Woo!

38:00.039 --> 38:00.880
Yes!

38:00.920 --> 38:03.519
- Did I scare you?
- Yes!

38:03.559 --> 38:05.039
Now, Ayana,

38:05.079 --> 38:06.800
as our final Frogger,

38:06.840 --> 38:09.920
you need to rescue
three baby froglets to win.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.440
If you get two, it will
come down to time.

38:12.480 --> 38:13.840
Ready, Frogger?

38:13.880 --> 38:14.960
Here we go.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.079
Okay.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.280
Wow. So we have massive
suspense here

38:20.320 --> 38:21.880
for Ayana Strutz.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.880
who merely needs to get two
froglets in under five minutes

38:24.920 --> 38:26.239
to get $10,000.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.719
Okay, all right.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.519
Ayana Strutz,
the windy city.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.280
- You got it.
- It’s just water.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.599
You got this.

38:33.639 --> 38:34.840
She’s got to make
that first jump, Damon.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.719
Already, the clock
ticking on Ayana.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.719
Probably want to jump.

38:38.760 --> 38:41.760
Here comes Harriet, and
Ayana is already in trouble.

38:41.800 --> 38:42.440
[shrieks]
- Oh, oh, oh!

38:42.480 --> 38:43.840
No!

38:43.880 --> 38:45.800
Ayana gonna have to fight
for her life right now.

38:45.840 --> 38:47.000
No!

38:47.039 --> 38:48.519
She’s holding on!
She’s holding on!

38:48.559 --> 38:50.320
-Oh! Oh!
-Get there!

38:50.360 --> 38:52.880
Ayana is a battler,
a dancer,

38:52.920 --> 38:53.960
a gymnast...

38:54.000 --> 38:55.519
Ballet and cheerleading.

38:55.559 --> 38:57.000
Come on, let’s cheer for her.

38:57.039 --> 38:57.840
Come on, Ayana!

38:57.880 --> 38:59.199
Oh, come on!

38:59.239 --> 39:00.039
Will yourself up!

39:00.079 --> 39:02.159
Ayana! Ayana!

39:02.199 --> 39:03.519
Ah!

39:03.559 --> 39:05.239
Ayana Strutz, fight of her
life right here.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.320
$10,000 hangs in the balance.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.519
Ah!

39:08.559 --> 39:09.960
I can do this!

39:10.000 --> 39:12.519
Pull yourself up,
this is the Boss Toad Temple!

39:12.559 --> 39:14.320
One life, it is over.

39:14.360 --> 39:16.039
She can’t stay here forever.

39:16.079 --> 39:18.719
This is the biggest moment
of her Frogger life.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.000
Dang it!

39:20.039 --> 39:21.320
Oh, this is brutal.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.519
This is high stakes
Frogger, Wayans.

39:23.559 --> 39:25.320
Help her out!

39:25.360 --> 39:27.800
Ah, I’m gonna give up, okay.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.039
She’s down and she’s out,
and she’s done!

39:32.760 --> 39:34.719
Ayana went down her way,
Wayans.

39:34.760 --> 39:35.880
I don’t know what way
that is,

39:35.920 --> 39:37.519
but she went down
with a smile.

39:37.559 --> 39:38.320
And I like it.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.719
Oh, wow.

39:39.760 --> 39:43.719
That means that Crystal Belcher
is getting $10,000

39:43.760 --> 39:45.000
the Golden Fanny Pack.

39:45.039 --> 39:46.199
What a night!

39:46.239 --> 39:48.000
Way to play the game.

39:48.039 --> 39:48.960
That was awesome.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.079
Congratulations.

39:50.119 --> 39:51.280
You rich, girl!

39:51.320 --> 39:53.400
Crystal Belcher!

39:53.440 --> 39:55.039
What a powerhouse.

39:55.079 --> 39:57.400
With all that sass,

39:57.440 --> 40:00.920
she kicked Boss Toad’s...
butt.

40:00.960 --> 40:01.920
Ah!

40:01.960 --> 40:03.360
Crystal who is not only
taking home

40:03.400 --> 40:06.559
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack,

40:06.599 --> 40:08.840
Crystal’s headed for the
ultimate Frogger championship.

40:08.880 --> 40:12.159
And the chance to win
$100,000.

40:12.199 --> 40:13.719
What a great night
for Frogger.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.840
I’m getting all
choked up in here. Woo!

40:14.880 --> 40:16.920
That was epic.
