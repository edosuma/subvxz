00:01.800 --> 00:04.000
having amnesia is like driving an obstacle course.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.200
I mean, I guess that's what it's like.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.700
Since my accident, no one will let me drive.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.700
look at you.You could be a model.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.000
No, last time that I wore this, mom,
you said I looked cheap.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.700
Well, you do,but in different clothes,
you could be a model.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.400
You know what?
I think I'm just gonna wait outside for dena.

00:21.450 --> 00:22.200
I'm serious, honey.

00:22.300 --> 00:25.700
On sunday, I'm hosting a solution six party,
and I really need your help.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.100
Beep, beep! Oh! She's here.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.600
I'm serious.
You're gonna love this.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.800
It's a revolutionary new clothing system--

00:31.000 --> 00:33.500
6 pieces give you outfits for 60 different occasions.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.600
It's like when jesus fed all those people
with bread and fish.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.500
Yeah, you know, I know that I don't remember the bible,
but I doubt it was anything like that.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.900
Well, honey, all my friends are gonna be there--
even doris janney.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.400
Come on.
Now that you're back in my life,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.200
I kinda wanna show you off.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.300
Mom, that's actually sweet.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.700
And when doris sees you model,

00:50.800 --> 00:54.000
I'll finally have something to lord over her
and her "daughter the actress."

00:54.100 --> 00:55.500
You know what?
I'm gonna have to pass, okay?

00:55.600 --> 00:59.600
I really don't wanna spend my sunday
making some mother feel bad about her child.

01:00.100 --> 01:01.100
I don't see why not.

01:01.700 --> 01:02.900
You do it every other day.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Ugh.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.200
come in.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.700
Hey. How's your dog?

01:09.900 --> 01:11.300
Well, much better.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.600
He really perked up after he puked in my car.

01:14.300 --> 01:15.400
Ready to party?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.800
Hmm. You know what?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.000
I have a better idea.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.000
Wait here.

01:25.300 --> 01:26.600
daddy?

01:27.000 --> 01:27.700
Uh-oh.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.500
Have you asked your mother?

01:29.500 --> 01:31.100
No. Silly.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.900
No. I was just thinking about, you know,

01:35.100 --> 01:38.300
independence and freedom

01:38.700 --> 01:42.700
and how those are really keys to being an american, you know?

01:43.100 --> 01:45.300
I mean, you like america,don't ya?

01:45.800 --> 01:48.800
You know who really loves america? Your mother.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.500
Dad, can I please borrow your car tonight?

01:50.600 --> 01:51.700
Not a chance.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.700
Yes! Why not? Come on, dad.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.600
The neurologist cleared me for driving a couple of weeks ago.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.400
Great.Then borrow his car.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.700
Come on, daddy. The amnesia only affected my memory.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.500
It did not affect my driving skills.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.400
You know what your driving skills
have gotten me in the past?

02:06.500 --> 02:10.000
Two busted garage doors and the death of a squirrel
that was like a little pet to me.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.700
You don't trust me.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.200
You don't think I've changed.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.100
Samantha,trust is not a given.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.400
It's earned.

02:19.600 --> 02:23.600
Look, I spend all day
explaining that to people.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.100
I don't wanna have to convince my own parents.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.500
doggone it.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.100
This is why I said to ask your mother.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.000
don't be a stinker.Use the blinker.
Okay.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.300
Ten and two is good for you.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.300
Speeding's a thrill,

02:48.600 --> 02:49.900
but it can surely kill.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
And don't ride
the damn brake.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.500
I don't have a rhyme for that.
Just don't do it.

02:56.000 --> 03:02.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:04.100 --> 03:06.100
whoo!

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
oh, my god! I'm free!

03:12.100 --> 03:14.200
I had the car windows down all day.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.000
You would have barely smelled anything.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.000
Oh, come on.You should be happy.
You don't have to drive me around anymore.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.900
I like driving you around.
That's why we're such good friends again.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.200
Oh, is that why you're worried--

03:24.400 --> 03:26.400
that I was just your friend for the rides?

03:26.500 --> 03:30.500
I'm afraid of how our friendship will suffer
when we're dead.Slow down!

03:31.000 --> 03:33.900
Okay, relax. I am in complete control right now.

03:34.100 --> 03:38.100
Just being behind the wheel is bringing back memories
of driving and instincts,

03:38.200 --> 03:39.800
skills--
raccoons!

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Maybe raccoons, too.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.600
No, raccoons!
Oh! Oh!

03:49.500 --> 03:50.400
oh.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.500
Raccoons.

03:56.500 --> 03:57.700
are you--are you all right?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.300
Maybe.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.100
Was I holding a drink in my lap before the crash?

04:03.500 --> 04:04.400
No.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.300
Then not so much.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.200
this is so not my fault.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.200
you can't see a raccoon at night.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.200
I mean, it's--
it's wearing a mask.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.700
See this speed?

04:29.800 --> 04:33.200
This is a nice speed.
People don't get hurt at this speed.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.100
My dad is never gonntrust me again.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.300
Good-bye, independence.
Good-bye, freedom.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.000
niCe knowing ya for...
6.2 miles.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.800
Please don't make me ride with you again.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.900
I mean it.I'll do anything you want.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.300
Anything?

04:54.300 --> 04:55.500
But I'm scared.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.700
You said "anything."

04:57.100 --> 05:00.700
I've never broken the law before.
This seems like an ambitious way to start.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.300
Well, then you shouldn't have said "anything."

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
Now just quit whining and help me,
or else you're going in next.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.100
you know,it's not to late to...

05:10.200 --> 05:11.800
stop before it gets illegal.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.100
You know, right now we're just pushing a car around a lake.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.700
That's good, clean fun.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.400
Just relax, all right?

05:19.600 --> 05:20.500
This is good.

05:20.700 --> 05:23.800
Everyone will assume
that the car was stolen out of the driveway overnight,

05:23.900 --> 05:25.500
and the insurance will buy a new one,

05:25.600 --> 05:26.900
and no one gets in trouble,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.600
and most importantly,
my dad will think that he can trust me.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.400
even though he can'T.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.200
you're pretty judgy for someone
who just dumped a car in a lake.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.600
wait. You are here.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.100
So where is the car?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.300
It's not in the driveway?

06:29.800 --> 06:30.700
I can't believe it.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.700
It played out exactly like I said--

06:32.800 --> 06:36.700
car gone, insurance,
bing-bang-boom. Easy peasy.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.600
"Dureen"?

06:37.800 --> 06:38.500
It's dena.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.100
Did they ask about me?
Was I implicated at all?

06:42.300 --> 06:43.200
No, no.

06:43.300 --> 06:46.300
And neither of us will be,
as long as we do not tell anyone else, okay?

06:46.400 --> 06:49.600
I can do that.Okay.
I've spent a lifetime keeping everything inside.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.800
"Siddhartha"?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.500
Oh, it's sama--
oh, forget it. Thank you.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.300
I've never done anything like that before.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.300
Well, neither have I.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.600
Yeah-huh.

06:59.100 --> 07:02.400
Yeah, okay, but that was old sam. That was bad sam.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.500
New sam is a good person who,

07:04.600 --> 07:08.100
just in an isolated incident,
made a rash decision,

07:08.300 --> 07:12.100
committed a small crime to save her dear father's heart.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.400
Okay, because maybe it was the moonlight or something,

07:14.500 --> 07:16.500
but you looked like something evil.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.500
Yes, i looked like,
but i wasn't, you know?

07:20.600 --> 07:24.600
It's like, um, you know,
it's like when a snake sheds its skin and, you know,

07:24.700 --> 07:28.200
you look, and the skin looks like it's a snake,
but actually, it's just a, you know, it's A...

07:29.300 --> 07:31.100
well, it's an empty shell.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.200
I really need to work on my examples, but anyway,

07:33.300 --> 07:35.900
what I'm saying is I'm not that person anymore.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.000
Where were you lasnight?

07:38.700 --> 07:39.900
Oh, my god.

07:40.100 --> 07:42.000
We didn't meet you at 8.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.000
We can totally explain.

07:44.500 --> 07:45.400
I'm waiting.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.600
Well, see, um...

07:50.000 --> 07:51.900
we were about to leave,and I got a phone call.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.100
From who?

07:53.800 --> 07:54.600
My dog.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.800
It was about her dog. She got a phone call from the vet.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.300
Are you two keeping something from me?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.200
No. Why?

08:06.500 --> 08:09.200
He called on a friday night?That's apecial vet.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.300
Well, it's a special dog.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
What'd he say?

08:12.800 --> 08:14.000
Nothing. He's a dog.

08:14.100 --> 08:14.900
I meant the vet.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.400
He said that we should watch the dog.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.200
Why?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.200
Because he's special.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.500
So you should watch him?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.700
I was talking about the vet.
I was talking about the dog.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.500
What do you wanna know?

08:22.700 --> 08:23.900
Why didn't you answer your cell?

08:24.000 --> 08:24.800
I was on the phone.

08:25.000 --> 08:25.700
All night?

08:25.800 --> 08:26.600
With the vet.

08:26.700 --> 08:27.300
Impressive.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.800
Like I said--
he's special.

08:28.900 --> 08:29.700
Mm-hmm.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.799
I'm getting a latte.

08:43.000 --> 08:43.600
what?

08:47.400 --> 08:48.600
Thought that went really well.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.000
ow!

08:53.100 --> 08:55.000
Oh, for crying out loud!

08:55.200 --> 08:57.000
Since when do we have an alarm?!

08:57.500 --> 09:00.300
Since your father spent a fortune on one...

09:00.400 --> 09:03.400
but refuses to pay a professional to install it.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.000
Well, I'm not gonna pay a professional
to do something any moron could do.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.200
Well, why are you doing it?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.800
Criminals were in our driveway,samantha,

09:13.100 --> 09:14.700
a few feet from where we sleep...

09:15.400 --> 09:16.900
occasionally in the buff.

09:17.100 --> 09:20.500
Well, all I can say is they must have been high on dope.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.900
There was an entire pallet of tulip bulbs on the porch,

09:23.000 --> 09:24.100
and they just left those.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.600
Well, don't, you know,

09:26.700 --> 09:30.500
overreact because of just one s-stolen car, you know?

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
I mean, cars get stolen all the time.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
It's--it's practically a tradition.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.300
Two stolen cars.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
What do you mean, two?

09:40.200 --> 09:42.900
Oh, that's right. You have that forgetting disease.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.300
My car was stolen four years ago.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.300
Just thinking about it
makes me need to chill some wine.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.400
Oh, now this is just the silliest thing
that you guys have ever done.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.100
That's not the only thing we did.

09:57.600 --> 09:58.800
Ta-da!
Ta-da!

10:01.100 --> 10:02.300
No.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.200
Yes!We got you a new car!

10:05.300 --> 10:09.300
Oh, guys, this is just way, way, way too much.

10:10.300 --> 10:10.900
But you know what?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.500
It's not unwrapped,so you can still return it.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.900
Sammy, this morning
when I came out and the car wasn't here,

10:17.400 --> 10:19.100
I was afraid you'd been in an accident.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.400
So there you are, dead,

10:21.600 --> 10:24.800
and your last thought would have been,
"my dad didn't trust me."

10:25.400 --> 10:27.800
Oh, no, no, no,don't say that.

10:27.900 --> 10:28.600
I was wrong.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.300
You have changed.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.700
You're not the same person that you were.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.500
So here you go,samantha newly--

10:35.600 --> 10:38.200
the keys to your brand-new car!

10:39.600 --> 10:41.700
oh, you sound like that man on the game show.
Say my name.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.700
Regina newly...
let's go inside and see what you've won.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.900
Oh! Ooh, look,it gave me chills.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.200
enjoy it, kid.

10:54.100 --> 10:54.800
Yay.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.700
the devil inside

11:03.100 --> 11:04.300
yeah, yeah

11:10.800 --> 11:13.700
samantha,What are you still doing out here?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.900
Aren't you ever gonna try out your new car?

11:16.100 --> 11:17.500
Yeah. Soon.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.200
Just, um, was it, uh,

11:20.300 --> 11:24.300
was it "ten and two works for you"
or "nine and three works for me"?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.400
I just don'T...

11:25.500 --> 11:27.600
you should see your father.He is so happy.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.800
Oh, this morning when he thought you'd been hurt,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.700
he told me he'd never been so worried.

11:34.700 --> 11:35.500
I was offended.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.500
I said, "what about that time when I had those polyps removed?

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
"I was under general anesthesia.
Anything could have happened.What if I had--"

11:41.700 --> 11:42.700
I pushed the car into a lake.

11:44.600 --> 11:45.600
You did what?!

11:45.900 --> 11:49.400
Some invisible raccoon with a mask

11:49.600 --> 11:51.000
made me crash into a tree,

11:51.100 --> 11:54.800
and I didn't want dad to think that he couldn't trust me,
so I panicked,and I sank the car.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.400
So you lied to us?

11:56.700 --> 11:59.400
Yeah. But I confessed.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.300
Did you see that?

12:00.400 --> 12:03.700
I-I confessed. I mean, old sam wouldn't have done that.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.800
Your father felt awful about not trusting you.
This is gonna break his heart.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.700
No, no, please, please,please, please don't tell him.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.500
Please,  can trust me, okay?

12:11.600 --> 12:12.900
I just--I just made a mistake.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.200
Look, I couldn't stand it
if I broke his heart.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.300
Well, I guess
we've all made mistakes.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.600
Mm-hmm, yeah.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.600
We all have.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.800
And I suppose telling him is
not gonna bring the car back.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.900
Oh, no. No, it probably won't come back at all.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.600
You know how I hate lying to your father.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.700
But I guess I could...

12:33.200 --> 12:34.500
keep this from him.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.800
Thank you. Thank you.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.900
I just need you to do one thing for me.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.600
Oh!

12:42.700 --> 12:46.600
and this elegant creation,"monaco nights,"

12:46.700 --> 12:48.300
can be easily accessorized

12:48.500 --> 12:51.800
by sliding the detachable cowl-neck

12:51.900 --> 12:54.800
down into... a belt.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.300
keep smiling.Doris los like she's gonna be sick.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.500
Ooh, was that a nice walk?

13:04.800 --> 13:06.600
Huh? Did we have a good walk?

13:07.600 --> 13:08.500
andrea,

13:08.800 --> 13:09.900
what are you doing here?

13:10.300 --> 13:13.600
Oh, I just dropped by to see how your dog is.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.800
Oh. He's good. Thanks.

13:16.900 --> 13:17.800
Yeah.

13:17.900 --> 13:18.700
Don't thank me.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.400
Thank that special vet.

13:20.900 --> 13:21.700
Okeydoke.

13:22.900 --> 13:26.100
Well, I, uh, I'd love to talk,
but I gotta run, so...

13:27.600 --> 13:29.500
don't worry.
It's only gonna take a minute.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.900
Oh, my.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.100
Probably less.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.200
You can't hurt me.
I have dogs.

13:34.300 --> 13:38.100
Oh, what is this I have here? Ah.
Lemon cookies.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.600
what do you wanna know?

13:47.200 --> 13:50.500
sorry! Sorry! Close it!
Quickly! Sorry!

13:51.000 --> 13:51.900
oh!

13:53.700 --> 13:54.700
What are you guys doing here?

13:55.300 --> 13:57.000
Guess who cracked like an egg?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.200
No, no, no. Oh!

13:59.300 --> 14:01.300
Get, get, get! Dena.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.500
What happened to a lifetime of keeping things inside?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.100
Her questions were really hard,

14:05.200 --> 14:08.300
and plus I really enjoyed
her finally taking an interest in me.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.800
nice scarf.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.200
Thanks.It's also a casual skirt.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.800
I can't believe you kept
a secret from me with her.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.500
I tell you everything.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.000
Okay, well, you know what?I'm sorry.

14:18.300 --> 14:21.400
But you should be happy
that I didn't draw you into this web of deceit.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.500
Honey, I'm an attorney.
Web of deceit is where I get my mail.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.000
samantha.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.000
We've still got 22 outfits left.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.000
Oh, hi, andrea.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.100
Oh, you know, there's a perfect dress for you in here.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.200
It looks just as good out at night
as it does stumbling home in the morning.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.900
Oh, oh.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.400
What is going on in there?

14:40.700 --> 14:41.500
nothing.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.300
My mother is blackmailing me
to model these stupid clothes.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.400
Blackmailing?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.000
Okay, I cracked, too.

14:47.100 --> 14:48.200
She knows everything.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.200
Everybody knows?
We are going down!

14:50.300 --> 14:50.900
Shh!

14:51.000 --> 14:52.700
Oh, you're not going down.

14:52.800 --> 14:53.600
Jeez!

14:53.700 --> 14:56.800
Do you remember the night
of the sacrificial shoe?

14:57.100 --> 14:58.200
Is that a nancy drew book?

14:58.300 --> 14:58.800
Oh.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.500
No, I don't remember it.

15:03.300 --> 15:04.700
That's not really how it works.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.800
Oh! The shoe.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.300
Oh!

15:12.000 --> 15:12.900
it's not moving.

15:13.900 --> 15:17.100
Use your legs.
That's why god gave you those big calves.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.100
Use your legs.It's your car.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.100
You can never just do something for me, can you?

15:22.700 --> 15:24.600
Why don't you just tell dad the truth?

15:25.500 --> 15:28.300
Because the last time I had an accident,

15:29.100 --> 15:33.100
he made me learn all these stupid... safety rhymes.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.300
I'm not going through that again.
Besides...

15:43.700 --> 15:44.800
I don't want him to not trust me.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.000
That's the scary face
she made at the lake.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.400
Bad sam is back.

15:58.800 --> 16:02.100
Oh, my god!
There's my baby girl!

16:02.200 --> 16:03.700
Oh,it's good to see you!

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
samantha!

16:06.100 --> 16:07.000
What are you gonna do?

16:07.200 --> 16:10.500
Right now I'm gonna go in there.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.400
I'm gonna smile,
turn this tube top into a turban,

16:14.600 --> 16:16.900
and then I'm gonna ruin her life.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.900
Yes, mother? I'm coming.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.100
Oh, no ?/

16:35.100 --> 16:36.100
oh, damn it.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.600
Hey, mom?

16:37.800 --> 16:38.700
in here.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.500
Look!

16:42.600 --> 16:44.100
I'm repainting your old birdcage.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.500
I didn't know I had any birds.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.700
Well, you didn'T.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.400
When you were little,
we put you in here to play.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.700
You locked me in a cage?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Well, you loved it.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.900
You'd eat crackers, and you'd repeat everything I said.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.100
Oh, we had so much fun,
till you chipped your tooth on that seed cake.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.700
Hey, you know what?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.200
Uh, speaking of fun,

17:01.300 --> 17:05.300
I was thinking maybe you and I could go down
to one of those places where you decorate pottery.

17:05.400 --> 17:09.400
You know, maybe paint a little piggy bank
shaped like a cat or somethin'?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.500
Oh, my lord. I've always wanted one of thE.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.300
Well,what are we waiting for?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.000
That would be wonderful.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.599
Oh, yes, and afterwards we could go to the mall
and get our makeup done

17:17.700 --> 17:19.800
so you won't look like a girl
who's trying so hard.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.599
this is gonna be so much fun.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.800
Hey, mom, do you mind driving?

17:31.100 --> 17:31.800
You...

17:32.400 --> 17:34.900
mom! Where you goin'?

17:35.200 --> 17:37.700
Don't you want your little cat bank?!

17:45.200 --> 17:46.300
who are you calling?

17:46.400 --> 17:47.200
A tow truck.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.100
Where are the t's?!

17:51.300 --> 17:53.000
Oh, you mean these?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.400
Samantha newly,

17:57.500 --> 18:00.200
you give me those right now,or I swear--

18:00.300 --> 18:01.000
what?What are you gonna do?

18:01.100 --> 18:04.700
You gonna make me a dress-up doll
for some hideous convertible clothes?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.800
that system is miracle!

18:06.900 --> 18:07.700
No, it is not.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.300
I looked in the bible,and it's not even close.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.300
I did not tell you to push
your father's car into the lake.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.200
You made that decision entirely on your own!

18:16.300 --> 18:18.600
Yeah, but I wouldn't have
thought about it if it wasn't for you,

18:18.900 --> 18:22.800
and then you knowingly make me
feel terrible and blackmail me?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.800
Which makes you even worse.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.000
Of course I am.I'm your mother!

18:27.800 --> 18:30.300
And my mother was worse than me. You...

18:32.100 --> 18:33.200
there is a streak of evil

18:33.300 --> 18:34.600
that runs back in this family.

18:34.700 --> 18:36.900
I am just praying that it gets diluted over time.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.600
Yeah, well,based on the parking lot in lake piedmont,
I'd say it's not.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.600
Well, you never met your great-grandmother ida.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.700
Trust me.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.900
Look, it is every generation's responsibility
to be better than the last.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.200
You're lucky that I'm not perfect.
You'd have nowhere to go.

18:51.800 --> 18:52.700
You know what?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
You're right.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.700
I should be better than you,

18:56.300 --> 18:59.400
which is why I'm gonna do something
that you could never do,

18:59.500 --> 19:01.500
which is tell dad the truth.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.300
And if you had any guts,
you would do the same thing.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.300
You're kidding.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.700
No. It's all true.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.300
And you did this, too,regina?

19:26.600 --> 19:29.100
I have no idea what she's talking about.Poor thing.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.000
Back to the neurologist, I say.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.200
I'm really sorry, dad.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.900
Please take my car back.

19:40.800 --> 19:41.600
Sammy...

19:42.500 --> 19:45.600
I spend a lot of time not thinking about my emotions.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.000
It's hard work,

19:47.200 --> 19:48.200
but it pays off.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.000
Then the other morning
when I thought about you dead by the side of the road--

19:53.100 --> 19:56.300
it just rushed in
how important you are to me.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.800
So if it cost me a car to remember that
every time I seyou in it,

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
I got off cheap.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.500
So...

20:07.300 --> 20:08.600
then I can keep it?

20:09.000 --> 20:09.700
Yeah.

20:10.000 --> 20:10.700
Yes!

20:11.300 --> 20:13.300
I just need you to do one thr g me.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.000
if my insurance found out
what your mother did, I'd fry.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.300
Now come on.Use those legs.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.800
I love you, dad.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
You, too, kid.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.200
so a bonk on the head
does make you free to change who you are.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
But there are curves in the road along the way,

20:51.800 --> 20:54.800
and no matter how far you've
gone to be who you wanna be...

20:55.000 --> 20:57.100
who you were
is always behind you...

20:58.200 --> 21:00.200
and closer than they appear.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.100
It's so good

21:02.200 --> 21:03.800
taking the road

21:03.900 --> 21:06.600
and never look back

21:07.305 --> 21:13.797
