17:33.594 --> 17:37.891
birds are my two best things.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.101
You have a very verbal daughter.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.188
Well, she loves to talk. She can

17:41.143 --> 17:44.188
just babble on about anything.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.441
It can be school, weather. She

17:44.230 --> 17:47.441
just talks, talks, and talks.

17:47.483 --> 17:51.571
I can't believe she does it. I

17:47.483 --> 17:51.571
have no idea where she gets it.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.823
Please, sit down.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.659
Thanks. Uh, you

17:53.865 --> 17:56.659
probably haven't noticed

17:56.701 --> 17:58.995
but I'm a little nervous.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.455
I noticed.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.166
It's just that this is the first

18:01.497 --> 18:04.166
time Stephanie hasn't been able

18:04.208 --> 18:05.668
to tell me what's bothering her.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.337
She may not be aware herself.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.841
We don't always know

18:08.379 --> 18:11.841
why we do the things we do.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.593
For instance..

18:13.634 --> 18:16.804
...do you know why

18:13.634 --> 18:16.804
you're dusting my table?

18:16.846 --> 18:18.932
Uh, I love to dust.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.018
Something wrong with that?

18:22.060 --> 18:23.770
What do you think?

18:25.563 --> 18:27.607
Well, when I was growing up

18:27.648 --> 18:30.860
all the other kids wanted

18:27.648 --> 18:30.860
to be astronauts or firemen.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.946
I wanted to be a maid.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.656
- I'm through coloring.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.656
- And not a moment too soon.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.701
Alrighty. Let's hang

18:35.698 --> 18:38.701
this up over here.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.120
Whoo, this is great!

18:42.080 --> 18:43.998
Who are all these people?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.751
Well, the one with

18:44.040 --> 18:46.751
the can of spinach is Joey.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.128
He does a great

18:46.793 --> 18:49.128
Popeye impression.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.255
[imitating Popeye]

18:52.757 --> 18:54.300
And this is my Uncle Jesse.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.970
He's got curly lips

18:54.341 --> 18:56.970
because he thinks he's Elvis.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.098
And this is my sister, D.J.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.977
What is this big red dot?

19:04.018 --> 19:05.979
That's her new zit.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.941
Stephanie, what's this

19:07.480 --> 19:09.941
squiggly line up here?

19:09.983 --> 19:11.776
That's a crack in the wall.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.821
- Well, how did that get there?

19:11.818 --> 19:14.821
- From the earthquake.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.740
And here's my sister Michelle

19:14.862 --> 19:17.740
and my dog, Comet.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.576
And here's me.

19:20.618 --> 19:23.871
I think I look taller in person.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.916
Well, now, who's this man

19:23.913 --> 19:26.916
standing outside the house?

19:26.958 --> 19:28.626
That's my daddy.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.130
Why isn't he inside

19:28.668 --> 19:32.130
with the rest of you?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.132
Because he was late.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.761
Was he late the day

19:36.342 --> 19:38.761
of the earthquake?

19:38.803 --> 19:43.265
Uh-huh. We didn't know where

19:38.803 --> 19:43.265
he was for three whole hours.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.685
Well, how did that

19:43.307 --> 19:45.685
make you feel?

19:45.726 --> 19:46.978
Terrible.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.982
I didn't know where

19:48.562 --> 19:50.982
you were or what happened.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.151
You should have been with me.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.778
I was so scared

19:53.192 --> 19:55.778
I'd never see you again.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.448
Oh, Steph, I'm right here.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.618
So you were scared

20:00.658 --> 20:02.618
after the earthquake

20:02.660 --> 20:04.912
because you didn't know

20:02.660 --> 20:04.912
where your Daddy was?

20:04.954 --> 20:06.372
Uh-huh.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.581
So do you think

20:06.413 --> 20:07.581
the reason you wanna

20:07.623 --> 20:09.542
be with Daddy all the time

20:09.583 --> 20:12.294
is so that you'll

20:09.583 --> 20:12.294
always know where he is?

20:12.336 --> 20:15.965
Yeah. What if there's

20:12.336 --> 20:15.965
another earthquake?

20:16.007 --> 20:18.425
Have you been thinking

20:16.007 --> 20:18.425
about that a lot?

20:18.467 --> 20:21.679
I try not to, but people

20:18.467 --> 20:21.679
are always talking about it

20:21.721 --> 20:23.263
and it's on TV

20:23.305 --> 20:24.765
and there are all

20:23.305 --> 20:24.765
those garbage trucks

20:24.807 --> 20:27.977
that feel like

20:24.807 --> 20:27.977
little earthquakes.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.730
When it comes to earthquakes,

20:28.019 --> 20:30.730
the best thing we can do

20:30.771 --> 20:32.690
is to be prepared for them.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.900
That's right.

20:33.941 --> 20:35.568
And we are prepared, Steph.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.320
We have all of our water

20:35.609 --> 20:38.320
and our food and our batteries

20:38.362 --> 20:40.948
and everything else

20:38.362 --> 20:40.948
we talked about. Remember?

20:40.990 --> 20:43.617
Uh-huh.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.617
But I still worry about you.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.955
I've got a good idea.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.249
Why not we make a list

20:47.997 --> 20:50.249
of things that you can do

20:50.290 --> 20:53.211
so you won't worry

20:50.290 --> 20:53.211
when your dad's away?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.504
Okay, like what?

20:55.546 --> 20:57.048
Well, your Dad can call you

20:57.090 --> 20:58.799
whenever he knows

20:57.090 --> 20:58.799
he's gonna be late.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.677
That's good. Then you'll

20:58.841 --> 21:01.677
always know where I am.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.972
Yeah, I like that.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.972
What else you got?

21:05.014 --> 21:06.682
Well, if you're

21:05.014 --> 21:06.682
still a little scared

21:06.724 --> 21:09.268
you can spend a couple

21:06.724 --> 21:09.268
more nights in dad's room.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.270
But in a sleeping

21:09.309 --> 21:11.270
bag on the floor.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.648
- Okay.

21:11.311 --> 21:14.648
- And only if you need to.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.109
We'll see what happens.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.028
Now, what can we do

21:16.150 --> 21:19.028
about those garbage trucks?

21:19.070 --> 21:21.822
What a racket!

21:21.864 --> 21:23.699
I'll call our councilman

21:21.864 --> 21:23.699
in the mornin'.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.576
Okay, I'll put this on the list.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.665
Alright, Steph, if you wanna

21:29.038 --> 21:31.665
camp out in my room

21:31.707 --> 21:33.500
the sleeping bag

21:31.707 --> 21:33.500
is still there.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.629
- Do you still snore, Daddy?

21:33.542 --> 21:36.629
- Yes.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.297
I'll stay here.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.383
Sorry.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.551
Listen, if you need anything

21:42.593 --> 21:44.428
I'll be right

21:42.593 --> 21:44.428
across the hall, okay?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.597
- Okay.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.597
- And I'm downstairs.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.850
But if you need me,

21:46.639 --> 21:49.850
I can be up here, like that.

21:51.769 --> 21:55.022
And if you guys need me,

21:51.769 --> 21:55.022
I'll be right here.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.276
That's my girl.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.736
- You're doing great.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.736
- Thanks.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.029
- Goodnight.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.029
- Goodnight, dad.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.697
- Goodnight, guys.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.697
- Goodnight.

22:03.739 --> 22:06.033
- Goodnight, Steph.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.201
Goodnight.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.205
D.J., could you do me a favor?

22:11.247 --> 22:12.790
Sure. What is it?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.667
Can you un-tuck me a little?

22:14.708 --> 22:16.502
I can't move.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.845
- There we go. Goodnight.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.845
- Goodnight.
