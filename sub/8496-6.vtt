00:02.900 --> 00:04.133
Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:04.233 --> 00:05.400
You're the director?

00:05.500 --> 00:06.800
Of my life story.

00:06.900 --> 00:08.667
No profits mean I get
to keep all the money.

00:08.767 --> 00:11.167
You want in for half?
Let's make a bomb.

00:11.267 --> 00:12.433
You kiss a guy
in front of everyone.

00:12.533 --> 00:16.167
You want my statement?
That's my statement.

00:16.267 --> 00:17.500
I regret letting
everyone else in on it.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.033
It's still just you and me.

00:19.133 --> 00:20.867
If making Lionel
suffer is your goal,

00:20.967 --> 00:22.367
you couldn't have picked
a better partner.

00:22.467 --> 00:23.767
Let's have revenge sex.

00:23.867 --> 00:26.167
There is something
you can do to make sure

00:26.267 --> 00:27.967
you never have to deal
with Lionel again.

00:28.067 --> 00:29.333
He sold us the arena.

00:29.433 --> 00:31.367
We're your new
landlords.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.367
I killed Olivia.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.767
I have to be German.
This has to be good-bye.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.600
People were asking
where you were.

00:39.700 --> 00:42.333
I had to finish
the scouting report.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.100
You work for Oscar.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.633
What's that for?
Your suicide note.

00:45.733 --> 00:47.100
This is the safest
place for me.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.067
I've never met
Oscar Kincade,

00:49.167 --> 00:50.267
but you're safe here.

00:50.367 --> 00:51.900
You said you never
met Oscar.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.467
You're working for him.
You can't keep me here.

00:54.567 --> 00:56.067
But I can take you down
to the station.

00:56.167 --> 00:58.067
For what?
Questioning.

00:58.167 --> 00:59.300
Under suspicion

00:59.400 --> 01:01.867
for the murder
of Olivia Vincent.

01:20.833 --> 01:22.767
Miss Hayes,
I'm Detective Curtis.

01:22.867 --> 01:24.300
Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.300
When I told the police
I'd testify against Oscar,

01:27.400 --> 01:29.433
I was told you would
protect me.

01:29.533 --> 01:31.133
And we are.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.433
I was taken,
held at knifepoint,

01:33.533 --> 01:35.400
and now one of your own people
is trying to set me up.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.633
I'll take a closer look
at Officer Halford,

01:37.733 --> 01:39.067
you have my word.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.333
You'll forgive me if I'm not
very trust these days?

01:42.767 --> 01:44.400
Is that her report?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.667
It is.

01:46.767 --> 01:48.400
She's documented
some rather

01:48.500 --> 01:51.067
harsh statements you've made
against Olivia Vincent

01:51.133 --> 01:52.833
while you were
in protective custody.

01:52.933 --> 01:54.533
That wasn't
protective custody.

01:54.633 --> 01:55.800
It was entrapment.

01:55.900 --> 01:56.967
She took me to that hotel

01:57.067 --> 01:58.433
knowing it would
bring back memories.

01:58.533 --> 01:59.900
She provoked me.

02:02.533 --> 02:04.467
"I've never hated
anyone so much--"

02:04.567 --> 02:07.067
That's--
"I could have killed her."

02:07.167 --> 02:09.167
I don't care
what Sloane said.

02:09.267 --> 02:11.433
She wouldn't hurt anyone.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.800
I know it's
frustrating, Pete.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.067
I'm just trying to get
at the truth.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.800
Well, the truth is,
Sloane is innocent.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.100
Well, she also
said that

02:18.200 --> 02:19.267
she's cheated
on her with Olivia.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.367
Oh, come on.
And that drove her

02:21.467 --> 02:23.533
to leave both you
and the Devil Girls.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.733
That was 20 years ago.

02:25.833 --> 02:27.400
I don't actually blame her
for any of it.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.100
So why did you tell
Officer Halford

02:29.200 --> 02:30.833
you never forgave her?

02:30.933 --> 02:33.500
Of course she forgave her,
why wouldn't she?

02:33.600 --> 02:36.067
Maybe she was bitter.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.733
Years of
watching Olivia

02:37.833 --> 02:39.333
live the glamorous
life of a Devil Girl

02:39.433 --> 02:41.633
while Sloane struggled
as a single mom?

02:41.733 --> 02:43.700
I've never looked back.

02:43.800 --> 02:45.400
I built a good life
for my daughter.

02:45.500 --> 02:50.067
And your daughter became
a Devil Girl under Olivia.

02:50.133 --> 02:51.967
Must've been hard for you.

02:52.067 --> 02:54.933
I understand you two
argued about Ahsha.

02:55.067 --> 02:57.133
Olivia was a bad influence.

02:57.233 --> 02:58.833
Sloane asked her
to back off.

02:58.933 --> 03:01.367
And she did...
back off.

03:01.467 --> 03:05.567
No, but--
So, in Sloane's eyes,

03:05.667 --> 03:06.867
Olivia took you,

03:06.967 --> 03:08.967
took her job

03:09.067 --> 03:12.233
and was about
to take her daughter.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.300
That's motive.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.133
Hey.

03:29.233 --> 03:31.267
I know you've been under
a lot of stress lately.

03:31.367 --> 03:32.467
What do you
think about

03:32.567 --> 03:34.800
driving up the coast
this weekend?

03:34.900 --> 03:36.067
Santa Barbara?

03:36.100 --> 03:37.800
Just the two of us.

03:37.900 --> 03:40.200
Yeah, sounds good.

03:42.700 --> 03:43.900
Hey, Coach?

03:44.067 --> 03:45.867
We start with scrimmage
or drills?

03:45.967 --> 03:47.533
Scrimmage.

03:47.633 --> 03:50.567
Or does the captain not bother
to read the practice schedule?

03:50.667 --> 03:53.167
Hey, those hotels
fill up fast.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.067
Let's pick one
before practice.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.433
Going to Santa Barbara
this weekend.

04:07.067 --> 04:08.200
You're in a good mood.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.433
Our kiss cost me
a sponsor,

04:10.533 --> 04:12.900
but it snagged me
two more.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.533
Rainbow Credit Card,
some type of gay aftershave?

04:17.633 --> 04:21.567
And I signed a book deal
for a million bucks.

04:21.667 --> 04:24.433
I mean, did you know
that there was a gay dollar?

04:24.533 --> 04:28.133
I'm rolling in it,
and it's awesome.

04:28.233 --> 04:30.733
That's great.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.133
Some people are asking

04:32.233 --> 04:33.833
how it's gonna
affect you long-term.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.667
Affect the team.

04:35.767 --> 04:37.900
Not everyone's gonna be
great about it.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.500
Screw 'em.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.200
I've seen you be a dozen
different poster boys.

04:43.300 --> 04:44.633
I'm glad you're
embracing this one.

04:44.733 --> 04:47.700
Al this money talk's
getting me worked up.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.767
I need a shower.

04:50.867 --> 04:52.733
Mind if I borrow that?

05:04.500 --> 05:06.167
I just got a text
from Jelena.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.067
She's tripling
the Devil's rent.

05:08.167 --> 05:10.400
You can afford it.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.100
You can't afford
the frown lines.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.300
It's not about
the money, Jackson.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.633
I'm calling Jude.

05:15.733 --> 05:18.367
Or come back to bed.

05:18.467 --> 05:21.867
Jelena and Terrence are
children with a new toy.

05:21.967 --> 05:24.833
Do not let them
ruin your morning.

05:30.167 --> 05:32.300
If we have sex, I'm only
gonna be thinking

05:32.400 --> 05:34.600
about sticking it
to them the entire time.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.167
Awkward.

05:37.267 --> 05:39.667
Yet I'm okay with it.

05:39.767 --> 05:42.700
Oh, my God.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.533
Oh, my God!

05:44.633 --> 05:47.900
I am having sex inside
Terrence Wall's locker!

05:50.600 --> 05:51.533
Cut!

05:51.633 --> 05:53.533
Hey.

05:53.633 --> 05:54.867
Only I can say that.

05:54.967 --> 05:56.367
Plus, we were
almost finished.

05:56.467 --> 05:58.700
Darling, you finished
three takes ago.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.767
What's next?

05:59.867 --> 06:01.300
All the Kyle-Raquel
scenes.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.600
Who's playing Raquel?

06:05.167 --> 06:06.667
I'm ready for my close-up.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.867
Kyle, meet Lexi.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.367
She came in an open
casting call

06:10.467 --> 06:13.567
and she was really,
really interested in you.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.100
So interested.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.300
Teddy, I know her.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.800
She's just here
to cause me trouble.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.367
Uh-- I'm here to launch
my acting career.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.900
Well, we could recast
but it would cost us.

06:24.067 --> 06:25.133
How much?

06:25.233 --> 06:27.700
100 grand.
$100,000?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.200
Mm-hmm.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.967
I just wanna help you
tell your story, Kyle.

06:37.267 --> 06:38.433
Jelena Howard?

06:40.067 --> 06:42.133
I'm looking for
Terrence... Wall.

06:42.233 --> 06:45.133
Terrence, I gotta go.

06:45.233 --> 06:46.333
And you are?

06:46.433 --> 06:48.400
Renee, I work
at his restaurant.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.133
Well, your restaurant,
Jelena's.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.833
I mean,
I used to work there.

06:52.933 --> 06:55.267
Terrence doesn't deal
with the hiring or firing.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.367
If you have a problem--

06:56.467 --> 06:58.367
No, I do,
but I wasn't fired.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.600
I have something
that belongs to him.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.533
Hi, baby, I'm sorry.
Hi.

07:22.633 --> 07:26.567
Lionel's swallowing
the rent hike.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.700
Not before some
solid choking, though.

07:30.133 --> 07:32.267
Oh, and I met
another chick

07:32.367 --> 07:33.800
looking to suckle off
your teet.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.600
Yeah, hopefully you turned
the hose on her.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.900
"A" for effort, though,
she got a job at Jelena's

07:38.067 --> 07:39.233
and then get herself
knocked up.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.833
Jelena's, who?

07:40.933 --> 07:43.400
Randy something.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.333
Renee?

07:51.067 --> 07:53.433
Look, it was one time.

07:53.533 --> 07:56.200
You and I were not together,
I was in a bad--

07:56.300 --> 07:58.267
You slept with this girl?

08:01.067 --> 08:02.667
You used protection.

08:02.767 --> 08:06.833
I was in the worst
place of my life.

08:06.933 --> 08:11.067
And we were apart,
my leg was wearing down.

08:11.167 --> 08:12.667
I was reckless.

08:12.767 --> 08:16.733
Reckless is running a yellow,
Terrence, you've--

08:19.967 --> 08:22.100
Just because she says
you're the father

08:22.200 --> 08:23.533
doesn't mean it's true.

08:24.833 --> 08:28.300
She needs to get tested.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.733
And so do you.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.633
I can see how your words
at the hotel

08:41.733 --> 08:43.733
could've gotten
away from you.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.533
Thank you.

08:45.633 --> 08:47.767
Your actions,
on the other hand...

08:47.867 --> 08:49.567
What actions?

08:49.667 --> 08:52.133
Taking Olivia's job
at the Devil Girls?

08:52.233 --> 08:54.900
I didn't take the job
to ruin Olivia.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.500
I did it
to take down Oscar.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.700
How do you think I got
access to the arena?

08:58.800 --> 09:00.600
Ask Michael Russell
at the League.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.367
He helped me investigate,
he knows.

09:02.467 --> 09:03.767
I spoke to him.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.567
He says your pursuit
of Oscar felt personal.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.900
He says it bordered
on... obsession.

09:10.067 --> 09:12.133
He said that?

09:12.233 --> 09:15.067
Olivia, Oscar.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.167
That's two people you seem
to be obsessed with.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.933
One might call that
a pattern.

09:21.767 --> 09:24.600
Sloane was not obsessed
with Olivia.

09:24.700 --> 09:27.300
Witnesses say they argued
multiple times

09:27.400 --> 09:28.833
before she was killed.

09:28.933 --> 09:31.800
Outside Sloane's house
and rehearsal studio.

09:31.900 --> 09:35.167
You walked in on
one of those, didn't you?

09:35.267 --> 09:36.533
I guess, but--

09:36.633 --> 09:38.867
Everything points
to Sloane being someone

09:38.967 --> 09:41.300
who takes things personally
and can't let go.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.133
Okay, even if that's true,
so what?

09:44.233 --> 09:46.700
It doesn't take much to go
from carrying a grudge

09:46.800 --> 09:48.133
to carrying out a vendetta.

09:48.233 --> 09:49.300
A vendetta?

09:49.400 --> 09:51.467
Olivia kept
winding her up.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.100
Maybe got to be
too much.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.833
Maybe Sloane's anger
took over.

09:54.933 --> 09:57.667
Maybe that's insane!

09:57.767 --> 09:59.567
Happens more often
than you think.

10:02.967 --> 10:06.433
Punching Oscar Kincade
in prison was bad.

10:06.533 --> 10:09.867
Punching a detective
in a police station?

10:09.967 --> 10:13.367
That's worse.

10:13.467 --> 10:17.367
Sloane had nothing to do
with Olivia's death.

10:31.533 --> 10:32.900
Thank you for coming.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.400
You called me.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.033
And I have somewhere else
I need to be, so...

10:39.533 --> 10:40.767
Thought you would
have traded that

10:40.867 --> 10:42.567
for a pack of
Parliaments by now.

10:45.567 --> 10:47.200
When you have
four blank walls,

10:47.300 --> 10:48.433
you create things
to look at.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.033
You expect me
to believe

10:50.133 --> 10:51.567
you've just been
staring at me.

10:51.667 --> 10:55.600
I'm disturbed, too.

10:55.700 --> 10:59.800
Mostly because it makes me
feel something I...

10:59.900 --> 11:03.367
don't like feeling.

11:03.467 --> 11:04.800
Regret.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.267
So toss it.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.633
I wish I could.

11:14.933 --> 11:21.267
My, uh... father,
he was a cold man.

11:21.367 --> 11:22.967
I got nothing
from him.

11:23.067 --> 11:28.133
When I became successful,
he got nothing from me.

11:28.233 --> 11:32.133
Family means nothing
to a Kincade.

11:32.233 --> 11:37.533
Yet, behind bars, it's all
I been thinking about.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.100
From the day
you were born,

11:44.200 --> 11:46.767
as far as I was concerned,
you didn't exist.

11:49.933 --> 11:54.300
Now I need you more than
I've ever needed anyone.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.967
You need me...
for what?

11:57.067 --> 11:58.633
I'm innocent, Jude.

11:58.733 --> 12:02.167
I need you
to help me prove it.

12:02.267 --> 12:04.300
How?

12:04.400 --> 12:06.600
The only evidence
they have

12:06.700 --> 12:08.900
is from a medical examiner
who skipped town.

12:09.067 --> 12:11.067
My lawyers can't
even question him.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.533
How fair is that?

12:13.633 --> 12:16.833
Help me find him
and clear my name.

12:18.867 --> 12:20.400
Why should I?

12:20.500 --> 12:22.567
So you can get revenge?

12:22.667 --> 12:24.100
So you can hurt
somebody?

12:24.200 --> 12:25.667
No.

12:27.367 --> 12:28.833
So I can get out.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.900
And so I can say
my son made it happen.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.900
Seconds on the clock.

12:53.067 --> 12:55.100
Half were Miami between me
and the basket.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.900
Pump, fake, shoot.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.467
Crowd goes wild.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.333
Bio's gonna be great.

13:00.433 --> 13:01.867
People love
their Zero.

13:01.967 --> 13:04.467
And there have been
so many.

13:04.567 --> 13:07.533
Christian, bad boy,
now you're gay.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.533
I'm not gay.

13:09.633 --> 13:10.767
The video of you
kissing your boyfriend

13:10.867 --> 13:13.067
has 8 million views
on YouTube.

13:13.133 --> 13:16.233
And then there's
that halftime pic
on your Instagram.

13:16.333 --> 13:17.400
I'm with a guy.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.133
Sure, last year
was a girl.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.633
I like everything.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.233
Everything
except labels.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.467
Let's talk about
your childhood.

13:23.567 --> 13:26.500
Past isn't really
my thing.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.167
I live in the moment.
Did you get that?

13:34.333 --> 13:35.633
Kyle!

13:35.733 --> 13:38.533
If you don't get it to stop,
I swear to God.

13:38.633 --> 13:39.867
Get what to stop?

13:41.200 --> 13:44.067
She's been following me
for the last hour.

13:44.100 --> 13:45.867
It's my process.

13:45.967 --> 13:47.567
I tried leaving, and she
trailed me in her car.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.400
It's like a bad
'70s cop show.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.767
I'll take care of it.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.333
Just go forth
with the knowledge

13:52.433 --> 13:55.433
this is all being handled
with dignity and respect.

13:55.533 --> 13:56.967
Lexi, here, girl.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.567
We've got another scene
to shoot.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.167
The sooner
you're done filming,

14:00.267 --> 14:01.700
the sooner I can kick your ass
back to the gutter.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.067
This is Chanel.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.167
Devil Girl, right?

14:09.267 --> 14:10.433
Used to be.

14:10.533 --> 14:13.167
You also used
to be straight.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.467
Me too.

14:16.567 --> 14:17.867
Look at us now.

14:17.967 --> 14:19.200
Look at us.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.467
I could use you,
actually.

14:21.567 --> 14:22.800
Use me?

14:22.900 --> 14:24.967
You sued to run
The Playground, right?

14:25.067 --> 14:28.167
Well, "Out" Magazine
is having a party
for me tonight.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.600
And I'll represent,

14:29.700 --> 14:31.933
but the party
has to represent me.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.367
Wanna help me run
quality control?

14:34.467 --> 14:36.733
You want me to help manage
your party?

14:36.833 --> 14:38.433
Yeah, yeah,
make sure it's cool.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.933
Maybe get
the dancers there.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.067
What do you say?

14:48.667 --> 14:51.067
We can hit a vineyard.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.067
Or rent bikes.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.833
Or bike a vineyard.

14:54.933 --> 14:57.467
Whatever.

14:57.567 --> 15:00.100
You don't sound
too into this.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.233
You're excited enough
for the both of us.

15:03.333 --> 15:04.800
Really excited.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.700
Okay.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.900
You wanna know
what's up?

15:12.067 --> 15:14.733
You said you weren't
at this dance.

15:22.133 --> 15:23.433
I don't trust him.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.733
I'm with you.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.867
This trip was
to prove it.

15:29.633 --> 15:32.600
The last time
you tried this hard,

15:32.700 --> 15:34.733
you'd just kissed Derek.

15:34.833 --> 15:39.300
And you felt guilty.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.133
Did you kiss him
again?

15:45.567 --> 15:46.867
Did you have sex
with him?

15:49.067 --> 15:50.167
Yes, but--

15:50.267 --> 15:51.700
Leave.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.233
German?
Go.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.400
Before I lose it.

16:17.900 --> 16:21.067
Look, I don't wanna
come between you two.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.300
Of course you don't.

16:22.400 --> 16:25.133
I can take care
of myself.

16:25.233 --> 16:27.533
I just want my son
to know his father.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.067
It's a boy?

16:33.533 --> 16:37.267
Let's see what
the paternity test says.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.433
Do you have a problem
with that?

16:39.533 --> 16:41.633
It's already been
a complicated pregnancy.

16:41.733 --> 16:44.733
I won't risk my baby just
to prove what I already know.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.533
It's just a blood test.

16:46.633 --> 16:49.267
Your blood, so,
no worries there.

16:49.367 --> 16:51.233
It's completely safe.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.400
I'll make
an appointment.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.600
I took care of it.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.633
My doctor in an hour.

16:59.767 --> 17:01.433
There's the address.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.900
You should leave now.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.167
Traffic's a bitch.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.067
All for me?

17:23.100 --> 17:26.200
Zero's party.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.200
I'm gonna throw
Jude some love.

17:28.300 --> 17:32.233
And Jelena
some battery acid.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.500
Mixed up with Jelena
and married to Oscar.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.233
What the hell happened
to you?

17:37.333 --> 17:38.967
A miscarriage.

17:39.067 --> 17:40.500
That's what happened
to me.

17:42.733 --> 17:44.467
Was it--
Pete's.

17:44.567 --> 17:47.533
Last gasp of
a dying marriage.

17:47.633 --> 17:52.733
I lost my career, I lost
my husband and then I...

17:52.833 --> 17:54.767
lost...

17:56.533 --> 17:58.300
Jelena saw how low I was.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.500
She offered me
a way out.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.467
It happened to involve
marrying Oscar.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.733
Sounds more like
a prison sentence.

18:07.833 --> 18:10.900
We need to break out
and sail to Fiji.

18:12.167 --> 18:14.300
You're an idiot.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.067
I'm a rich idiot

18:16.100 --> 18:18.533
who wants to see you out of
that dress and onto a beach

18:18.633 --> 18:21.833
with no blood-sucking
cheerleaders in sight.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.967
Sounds like a great opportunity.

18:39.067 --> 18:40.533
Call my reps next week.

18:44.133 --> 18:45.933
Another 500 Gs
in the piggy.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.967
That was
a passion project.

18:48.067 --> 18:49.333
Gay energy water?

18:49.433 --> 18:52.967
Eh, you know,
thirst is universal.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.067
Great party,
Zero.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.767
Yeah,
this is my life.

18:55.867 --> 18:57.100
Guaranteed best seller.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.367
Hmm, you know what would
really guarantee it?

18:59.467 --> 19:02.067
Your journey here
from foster care.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.800
Journey?

19:03.900 --> 19:06.900
I told you
the past is the past.

19:07.067 --> 19:08.067
I really wanna focus--

19:08.167 --> 19:09.900
I know what
you wanna focus on.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.700
Zero, you agreed to a biography,
not a coloring book.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.667
Your fans wanna
know the real you.

19:14.767 --> 19:16.867
Hey, bitch, Devil Girls
are about to dance.

19:16.967 --> 19:19.733
Come stand near me so I can see
if girls really do turn you on.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.300
The ladies need me.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.067
I'll bring him back,
maybe.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.267
Everybody move!

21:36.633 --> 21:40.333
I already told you where I was
when Olivia was killed.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.700
At home... alone.

21:46.067 --> 21:47.533
Then we have a problem.

21:49.233 --> 21:52.467
These are
your fingerprints

21:52.567 --> 21:54.733
at the scene
of the crime.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.667
I went to Olivia's,
but that was weeks--

21:57.767 --> 22:00.167
These were pulled the night
she was murdered.

22:00.267 --> 22:02.433
That's not right,
that's a lie.

22:02.533 --> 22:05.667
This is Oscar,
he's setting me up!

22:05.767 --> 22:08.067
Sloane, based on this,
I wouldn't be doing my job

22:08.100 --> 22:10.500
if I didn't get a warrant
to search your home.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.800
I'm gonna need
his number.

22:20.900 --> 22:23.200
Sloane's in a lot more trouble
than I realized.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.933
Yeah, call me back.

22:26.067 --> 22:27.367
Still here?

22:27.467 --> 22:29.133
I'm not leaving Sloane
to a witch hunt.

22:29.233 --> 22:31.533
I think
you should see this.

22:33.067 --> 22:35.300
Sloane's fingerprints
from the crime scene.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.067
That's impossible.

22:37.167 --> 22:38.867
Is it?
Mm-hmm.

22:38.967 --> 22:42.267
If she did this,
would she tell you?

22:42.367 --> 22:44.067
How she took
Olivia's job?

22:44.167 --> 22:45.400
Didn't tell you.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.500
I guess Oscar didn't
tell you.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.233
She had your child

22:50.333 --> 22:53.100
and she didn't
tell you, hmm.

22:55.067 --> 22:57.633
Isn't it possible she's
hiding another secret?

23:14.667 --> 23:16.967
Come on,
everybody follow me.

23:17.067 --> 23:18.567
They're gonna
search the house.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.067
There's a gun in a box
by the fireplace.

23:20.167 --> 23:21.600
You have a gun?
I need you
to get rid of it.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.367
It's unregistered,
if they find it...

23:23.467 --> 23:26.567
Pete, please
do this for me.

23:43.133 --> 23:45.867
Lionel,
thanks for coming.

23:45.967 --> 23:49.067
I'm so happy that
Jude's found love.

23:49.167 --> 23:50.900
I didn't think
it would be with you.

23:51.067 --> 23:54.067
Me either.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.067
If you hurt him,
I'll drive my car

23:56.133 --> 23:58.467
so far up your ass,
you'll taste wiper fluid.

24:01.067 --> 24:02.700
Great party.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.200
Hey, thanks for
letting us film here.

24:12.300 --> 24:15.200
You know, the sooner
we finish...

24:17.500 --> 24:19.700
He's looking at you
like you're lunch.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.133
He is 23 if a day.

24:22.233 --> 24:24.767
23-year-olds need
to eat, too.

24:24.867 --> 24:27.267
Kyle, I can't.

24:27.367 --> 24:29.233
All that it would be
is sex.

24:29.333 --> 24:31.600
You say that like
it's a bad thing.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.467
Raquel, you don't have
to hitch your wagon

24:33.567 --> 24:35.200
to every horse you spend
a little time with.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.533
Have some fun!
Ride that pony!

24:40.167 --> 24:41.167
You're a supportive wife.

24:41.267 --> 24:43.200
What, that?

24:43.300 --> 24:44.300
That, that was a joke.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.233
Your relationship's
a joke.

24:47.333 --> 24:50.067
I thought this movie
would get me an IMDB credit.

24:50.167 --> 24:51.800
Who knew it would give me
the chance

24:51.900 --> 24:53.533
to get back at you?

24:53.633 --> 24:55.733
You exposed my sham
relationship...

24:57.367 --> 24:59.067
I'm gonna expose yours.

25:01.567 --> 25:05.300
Lexi, the only one playing
pretend here is you.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.133
Let's go finish your
scenes so you can go back

25:07.233 --> 25:09.267
to being your real
sad little self.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.600
Okay, this is
the last Raquel scene.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.667
So I wanna make sure
it's perfect.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.900
This is Lexi's last scene,
what are we waiting for?

25:20.067 --> 25:21.133
Let's go, go, go.

25:21.233 --> 25:22.467
What's the scene?

25:22.567 --> 25:25.533
Oh, uh, the moment you
and Raquel fell in love.

25:25.633 --> 25:26.667
Oh, uh, I...

25:26.767 --> 25:29.233
made some changes
to the script.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.067
Lexi's idea,
she's a genius.

25:32.133 --> 25:34.233
Hold up.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.400
This says
they kiss.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.167
Mm-hmm.
Of course we kiss.

25:38.267 --> 25:40.867
I'm playing the woman
you love, Kyle.

25:40.967 --> 25:43.900
Is it a real
marriage or not?

25:44.067 --> 25:46.100
All right,
picture's up!

25:46.200 --> 25:48.867
We're rolling, slate.

25:51.067 --> 25:54.433
And... action.

25:54.533 --> 25:57.600
You're such
a good friend.

25:57.700 --> 26:00.133
Best friends.

26:00.233 --> 26:02.367
I love you.

26:05.067 --> 26:06.933
I...

26:08.133 --> 26:11.800
I-I love you...
Raquel.

26:13.100 --> 26:16.267
No, I love you

26:16.367 --> 26:18.300
with all my vagina.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.300
I know
you feel it, too.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.500
We are lady lovers,
Kyle.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.633
Don't reject your heart.

26:28.733 --> 26:29.833
Kiss me.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.567
What's it gonna be,
Kyle?

26:57.933 --> 26:59.700
I'd say we got
that in one take.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.167
Looked good to me.

27:01.267 --> 27:02.600
Lexi, you okay?

27:02.700 --> 27:06.333
Yeah.
I'm good.

27:10.067 --> 27:11.267
Really great work.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.500
Thanks.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.833
Hey, I gotta head out,
you gonna be okay?

27:25.933 --> 27:28.400
Yeah, sure.

27:29.433 --> 27:30.533
Taking off, too.

27:30.633 --> 27:33.767
Lot of, uh,
distractions here.

27:33.867 --> 27:35.467
I was hoping we could
talk this week.

27:35.567 --> 27:37.600
Maybe check out
the house you grew up in.

27:39.733 --> 27:40.633
He can't.

27:40.733 --> 27:41.967
We have a home game
against Dallas.

27:42.067 --> 27:43.567
No time
to jet to Colorado.

27:43.667 --> 27:46.267
Oh, it's not in Colorado,
it's here in L.A.

27:46.367 --> 27:47.400
I dug up the address.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.400
You said
you're from Denver.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.733
How many times
do I have to tell you

27:51.833 --> 27:53.667
that my past isn't
part of the deal?

27:53.767 --> 27:56.167
You're getting a million
dollars for a tell-all.

27:56.267 --> 27:58.733
Either you tell all
or there is no book.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.067
Screw the book.

28:01.100 --> 28:03.100
I'm going to get a drink.
I'll see you later.

28:15.100 --> 28:16.333
Hey, have you seen Derek?

28:16.433 --> 28:17.833
I need to give him a heads-up
about something.

28:17.933 --> 28:20.900
I heard he stayed home.
He's popular tonight.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.067
What do you mean?

28:22.133 --> 28:23.800
German was here
looking for him, too.

28:25.267 --> 28:26.467
I gotta go.

28:30.267 --> 28:32.367
You've got a dirty cop
in your house.

28:32.467 --> 28:34.567
Halford fabricated this case
against my client.

28:34.667 --> 28:38.133
Officer Halford has
an impeccable record.

28:38.233 --> 28:41.867
We found nothing to back up
Sloane's conspiracy claim.

28:41.967 --> 28:45.633
What we do have is physical
evidence putting her

28:45.733 --> 28:48.067
at Olivia Vincent's
the night of her murder.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.133
Go to hell!

28:52.133 --> 28:54.467
Your client appears to believe
that she's above the law

28:54.567 --> 28:57.167
when it comes to
what she feels is justice.

28:57.267 --> 28:58.833
I think
she murdered Olivia

28:58.933 --> 29:01.100
and tried to pin it
on Oscar Kincade.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.667
One stone, two birds.

29:02.767 --> 29:05.067
No one who knows me
would believe that.

29:05.100 --> 29:10.800
When I talked to Pete,
I saw it in his eyes.

29:10.900 --> 29:11.933
Doubt.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.567
I'm glad you came back.

30:07.467 --> 30:10.967
DME, I paid someone
to track him down.

30:11.067 --> 30:14.367
I got his phone number.

30:14.467 --> 30:16.233
You did?

30:16.333 --> 30:19.000
But you're still not sure
you can trust me.

30:24.833 --> 30:26.900
I think you had
that dancer killed.

30:28.200 --> 30:32.400
And I think you're using me
to try to get off for it.

30:32.500 --> 30:36.300
I'm risking signing
a man's death warrant.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.867
Risking being
an accomplice

30:38.967 --> 30:42.933
because I wanna believe
you really care about family.

30:43.033 --> 30:44.667
Care about me.

30:46.467 --> 30:49.533
We can absolutely get
to know each other.

30:49.633 --> 30:52.567
But here, one on one,

30:52.667 --> 30:54.567
while you let
the courts decide.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.400
If you call this number,

31:01.500 --> 31:03.633
it'll be the last time
you ever see me.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.667
What are you doing
in my house?

31:27.767 --> 31:30.800
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this disrespectful?

31:32.233 --> 31:33.933
Did I cross a line?

31:34.067 --> 31:37.233
Because you knew
all about crossing lines.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.533
Like when you had sex
with my girlfriend.

31:39.633 --> 31:42.333
You need to leave...
now.

31:42.433 --> 31:43.900
No, I'm just
getting started.

31:44.067 --> 31:45.300
Okay.

31:47.667 --> 31:48.933
Let's do this.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.300
You have no morals.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.967
No boundaries.

31:55.067 --> 31:58.067
No respect for other
people's relationships.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.467
Telling me that you're
coming for my girl?

31:59.567 --> 32:01.733
Yeah, if Ahsha was
really your girl,

32:01.833 --> 32:04.200
you wouldn't be here,
would you?

32:12.567 --> 32:14.833
You're a rabid dog.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.067
And rabid dogs need
to be put down.

32:17.133 --> 32:18.800
German!

32:27.333 --> 32:28.600
Are you okay?

32:29.633 --> 32:30.933
Yeah.

32:33.133 --> 32:34.933
German, wait!

32:38.433 --> 32:40.333
German,
please calm down.

32:40.433 --> 32:41.433
Why?

32:41.533 --> 32:42.633
So, you can lie
to me again?

32:42.733 --> 32:44.933
I never lied to you.

32:45.067 --> 32:46.300
I chose you.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.467
You chose me?

32:47.567 --> 32:49.400
Like you were doing
charity work?

32:49.500 --> 32:50.933
You're lying
to yourself, Ahsha.

32:51.067 --> 32:52.700
What are you
talking about?

32:52.800 --> 32:55.200
All you see when you look
at me is a killer.

32:59.500 --> 33:02.067
Tell me
you don't love him.

33:02.133 --> 33:04.333
Tell me you don't feel like
you're denying yourself

33:04.433 --> 33:06.167
not being with him.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.433
I can't.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.133
I'm sorry.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.067
Me too.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.333
Ahsha.

33:42.467 --> 33:44.833
I was hoping you'd be
having hot cage sex

33:44.933 --> 33:45.900
with Tweety Boy by now.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.400
Have yourself
a cockatoo.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.400
Guess you had to tuck
Miguel into bed, huh?

33:50.500 --> 33:53.867
Actually, Miguel's
at a sleepover.

33:56.800 --> 34:00.667
Looks like Mommy had
a sleepover, too.

34:06.833 --> 34:08.300
We're screwed.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.067
What are you talking about?
Today went great.

34:10.100 --> 34:12.067
Tragically great.

34:12.167 --> 34:14.467
Teddy got his daddy to leak
some of the footage he shot.

34:14.567 --> 34:16.333
It's online,
people are talking.

34:16.433 --> 34:17.633
About how bad it is?

34:17.733 --> 34:19.633
No, about
how good it is.

34:19.733 --> 34:21.933
"Biting indie satire
looks hilarious,

34:22.067 --> 34:24.867
already generating
buzz with distributors."

34:24.967 --> 34:27.467
The only way this game works
is if the movie loses money.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.667
If this thing takes off,
there's gonna be a whole lot

34:29.767 --> 34:32.067
of scary dudes coming to collect
their share of the profits.

34:32.133 --> 34:33.467
How scary?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.800
Hello, Thomas.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.067
It's Jude.

35:04.500 --> 35:07.167
You just lost your son.

35:07.267 --> 35:08.900
Good-bye.

35:55.633 --> 35:57.367
Where you been?

35:57.467 --> 36:00.333
I'd rather talk about this.

36:00.433 --> 36:02.867
You grew up in L.A.?

36:02.967 --> 36:04.067
So what?

36:06.533 --> 36:07.767
You wanna cash in
on coming out

36:07.867 --> 36:09.367
without
actually coming out.

36:09.467 --> 36:12.733
Where we at
the same party?

36:12.833 --> 36:15.133
I don't mean
coming out as gay.

36:15.233 --> 36:16.667
I mean coming out
as Gideon.

36:16.767 --> 36:18.500
People care
about your story.

36:20.467 --> 36:21.933
You don't know
how lucky you are

36:22.067 --> 36:24.133
having people who wanna
know who you really are.

36:29.067 --> 36:31.433
Okay.

36:31.533 --> 36:33.467
I'll go to that house,

36:33.567 --> 36:34.967
tell my story.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.933
But not to him.

36:40.333 --> 36:42.067
To you.

36:52.800 --> 36:54.600
You ready for Fiji?

36:55.967 --> 36:58.767
I'd love to when
I'm not so busy.

36:58.867 --> 37:02.533
Lionel, I own 17 companies,
and I'm not too busy.

37:02.633 --> 37:04.667
Two weeks,
we can leave tonight.

37:04.767 --> 37:08.167
I can't trust these people
alone here for two hours.

37:12.100 --> 37:14.800
It's that chair.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.200
You can't leave it
even for a second.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.067
Excuse me?

37:19.167 --> 37:20.567
You were in a bad place,

37:20.667 --> 37:23.200
and that chair gave you back
some control, I get it.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.267
But it's poisoning you.

37:27.367 --> 37:29.867
Can't you see that?

37:29.967 --> 37:31.467
I won't let this place
get to me.

37:31.567 --> 37:35.067
It already has.

37:36.967 --> 37:39.233
Jackson,
where are you going?

37:40.767 --> 37:42.933
I can't wait for you
to realize

37:43.067 --> 37:45.667
what you're doing
to yourself.

37:45.767 --> 37:46.900
I waited when
you were with Pete,

37:47.067 --> 37:48.867
and I won't do
that again.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.067
Why does it have
to be a choice?

37:53.133 --> 37:54.200
Obviously, it's not.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.600
People are coming
for you.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.500
For that chair.

38:01.167 --> 38:04.067
You may lose it.

38:04.133 --> 38:06.067
Then you could have
nothing.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.800
Good-bye, Lionel.

38:15.567 --> 38:17.300
Hey.

38:17.400 --> 38:19.600
I just passed Jackson,
the man looks a mess.

38:19.700 --> 38:22.633
Oh.
That didn't take long.

38:24.567 --> 38:25.833
I knew siccing
Jackson on Lionel

38:25.933 --> 38:27.633
would help us one way
or another.

38:27.733 --> 38:29.067
They'd run away together

38:29.133 --> 38:32.067
or he'd leave her
broken and alone.

38:32.133 --> 38:33.933
Either way, win-win.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.067
What?

38:43.667 --> 38:45.067
The results came back.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.100
The baby's mine.

39:00.367 --> 39:03.067
My officers finished
the search of the house.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.500
Forensics were
inconclusive.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.900
So no hard evidence.

39:08.067 --> 39:11.100
But we did find
something else.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.067
Sloane's signed confession
to killing Olivia Vincent.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.400
My what?

39:15.500 --> 39:17.133
"I can't outrun the past.

39:17.233 --> 39:18.767
"This guilt won't
leave me alone.

39:18.867 --> 39:20.100
"What I've done,
I can't undo.

39:20.200 --> 39:22.433
All I can do is beg
for forgiveness."

39:22.533 --> 39:23.467
Where'd you
get that?

39:23.567 --> 39:25.067
Detective!

39:28.067 --> 39:29.733
That's the guy that
tried to kill me.

39:29.833 --> 39:31.100
He forced me to write that!

39:31.200 --> 39:32.567
She okay?

39:32.667 --> 39:33.800
Sloane Hayes,
you're under arrest

39:33.900 --> 39:35.100
for the murder of
Olivia Vincent.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.400
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.733
No, this is wrong!

39:37.833 --> 39:39.600
If you refuse to remain
silent, anything you say

39:39.700 --> 39:42.133
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.
Get your hands off of me!

39:42.233 --> 39:43.733
No!

39:46.233 --> 39:48.367
Next time on "Hit the Floor"...

39:48.467 --> 39:51.367
I not only don't believe
that baby is Terrence's,

39:51.467 --> 39:53.067
I'm going to prove it.

39:53.100 --> 39:54.900
You ready to face
your past?

39:55.067 --> 39:56.467
You can handle this.

39:56.567 --> 39:58.067
One look at the paperwork,
and everyone's gonna know

39:58.133 --> 40:00.767
that it was a
scam, everyone.

40:00.867 --> 40:01.967
If I'm gonna
get out of this,

40:02.067 --> 40:04.500
I need to find who really
killed Olivia.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.833
German, my mom's been charged
with Olivia's murder.

40:06.933 --> 40:08.433
You can't hide
from this anymore.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.100
German?

40:10.200 --> 40:11.433
Is German okay?

40:11.533 --> 40:14.533
I just saw him,
and he looked really weird.
