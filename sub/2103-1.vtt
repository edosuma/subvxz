05:59.792 --> 06:01.553
Yes?

06:02.720 --> 06:07.260
- Nothing.
- Is there some words to follow that look?

06:07.360 --> 06:09.110
- No?
- No.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.760
- It's not that short.
- It's short.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.140
It's not that short.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.486
This is how short it was
when we met each other.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.241
- Yeah, you loved that guy, didn't you?
- It was not.

06:25.341 --> 06:28.580
- Yes, it was. It was actually exactly like this.
- 'Cause I would have...

06:28.680 --> 06:31.420
I would have thought that you
had looked like a criminal if, if...

06:31.520 --> 06:33.980
- I don't look like a criminal.
- ...if you had it that short when we met.

06:34.080 --> 06:39.550
I would've stayed... I would've avoided you
on the street with that haircut. Sorry.

06:43.360 --> 06:46.060
You're mad. I'm just trying
to make a... what,

06:46.160 --> 06:49.585
a smidge of an effort
for our little getaway.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.620
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.540
Why?

06:55.400 --> 06:58.060
Why are you making such an effort? It's like...
that's like, that's like something someone

06:58.160 --> 07:01.380
would do if they were, I don't know,
going to propose or something.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.900
- Going to propose?
- Yeah.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.940
People can get their hair cut
without it leading to marriage.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.620
You mental-head. Come here,
okay, while we're on the topic,

07:10.720 --> 07:11.940
- just answer this question.
- Okay.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.911
Marriage: why?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.060
Seriously, that's the question?

07:20.360 --> 07:22.580
"Marriage: why?" Because it shows
that two people love each other,

07:22.680 --> 07:24.260
- and care about each other and...
- No, it doesn't. No, it doesn't.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.940
- ...They want to spend the rest of...
- No! Incorrect. It does not.

07:28.040 --> 07:31.520
Okay, so tell me, what...
what does marriage mean to you, Mark?

07:31.640 --> 07:35.740
It means slavery, is what it means.
It means shackles, is what it means.

07:35.840 --> 07:41.200
It means going back to the bloody,
I don't know, 1800s. That's what it means.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.700
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.140
Think about it, right? Waking up every day
and choosing to be with somebody.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.380
That is a commitment, a commitment
that you can choose every day.

07:49.480 --> 07:54.460
Being... being legally bound to.
Yeah? Legally bound to.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.749
That is slavery.

07:58.800 --> 07:59.980
Yeah. Correct.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.900
So, what, are you saying
that you never want to get married?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.860
Well, I don't know. I don't want
to say never. Well, I mean...

08:05.960 --> 08:08.661
No. Probably not.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.750
You need to follow this road
until you come to a T-junction. Yeah.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.540
Aw, yeah...

08:27.640 --> 08:29.620
What was that? What was that?

08:29.720 --> 08:33.940
I'm giving the man The Guns.
"Hello, good to see you." I'm waving.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.380
That's not how you wave.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.740
- That's not how you wave?
- No.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.620
- You're going to tell me how to wave?
- Yeah.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.140
There's, like, a technique to it.
It's, like, a country wave.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.980
- The Country Wave!
- The Country Wave, yes.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.700
- That's a thing?
- You're going right here.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.460
- Is there really a Country Wave?
- It's a Country Wave.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.020
Yeah, it's like how people
in the country wave to each other.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.344
Yeah, right. You're off your face.

08:54.480 --> 08:58.820
Okay, so you're... Basically your hand
is on the steering wheel...

08:58.920 --> 09:01.458
and it should never leave.
It's just one finger.

09:01.558 --> 09:03.580
- Just one finger, yeah. By itself.
- Just one finger? By itself?

09:03.680 --> 09:05.340
- Like that? One finger?
- Yes.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.860
Okay, try these people.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.820
- Index finger?
- Index finger.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.140
- Hey!
- See?

09:11.240 --> 09:13.860
It does actually work!
Let's do these fellas there.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.700
Hey! I'm on fire right now.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.820
Congratulations.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.920
I'm gettin' it! I'm blending in.
They're accepting me as one of their own.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.660
Let's get this fella here, now.
Watch. You ready?

09:26.760 --> 09:28.354
Alright, hold on.

09:28.654 --> 09:30.020
You fuckin'...

09:30.120 --> 09:32.540
Do you know what, actually? Do you know what?
I've another one finger wave for you...

09:32.640 --> 09:34.500
Mark, don't!

09:34.600 --> 09:36.770
I'm joking.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.709
Recalculating...

09:59.720 --> 10:01.829
Mark, this isn't the road.

10:01.929 --> 10:04.340
- It is the road.
- Well, this is saying that it's not the road.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.140
I know, but... it is the road.
I'm telling you now.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.502
Look, I know exactly where I'm going.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.060
- Recalculating...
- "Recalculating, recal..."

10:15.160 --> 10:17.420
- I know where it is. Don't worry.
- Okay.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.740
It's basically straight.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.549
Straight...

10:23.800 --> 10:26.537
- Recalculating...
- Recalculating again.

10:26.637 --> 10:29.348
Just... put that thing in the bin.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.700
Okay, this isn't... Turn around.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.504
Give me a minute.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.663
Oh, fu...!

11:26.848 --> 11:30.644
For fuck's sake.

11:39.480 --> 11:43.060
Mark, it's properly stuck.
There's, like, it's... spinning around.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.660
Mark, stop! You can't!
You're going to wreck the car.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.888
- Fine.
- There's a massive hole there.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.660
Okay, look...

11:52.360 --> 11:56.000
I'm going to get out and push, yeah?
You reverse just a little bit. Okay?

11:56.100 --> 11:57.865
Yep, okay.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.356
Geez, this fuckin'...

12:03.760 --> 12:07.860
It's a massive fucking puddle...
I think we should just stay here.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.681
- This is a lovely spot.
- Oh, you're hilarious!

12:13.440 --> 12:15.269
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.784
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.346
Go!

12:31.820 --> 12:33.487
Mark...

12:38.480 --> 12:40.302
Shit.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.320
Here, hand me up my phone, will you?

12:48.720 --> 12:49.900
I'll just ring my dad.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.140
- You're not ringing your dad!
- It's fine. He'll know what to do.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.842
You're not ringing your dad.
Call AA, if you're calling anybody.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.063
- Have you a signal on that?
- No.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.650
Okay... New plan.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.428
What's the plan?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.500
I'm going to go find a house.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.280
- Okay, I'll go with you...
- No, no, no, no.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.500
I'm going to go find a house.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.180
You stay with the car.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.230
If, like, a car comes, see if you can get,
like, a tow rope or whatever.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.086
Okay?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.091
Okay?

13:32.480 --> 13:35.351
- So, just stay with the car?
- Stay with the car.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.383
Stay with the car...

18:42.360 --> 18:43.905
Hello?

18:52.680 --> 18:54.264
Hello?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.384
Hello?

19:44.240 --> 19:47.584
Hey, is there anybody...
Is there anybody home here?

19:52.240 --> 19:53.962
Hello?

19:54.600 --> 19:58.264
I just have a car stuck up the road there.
Is there anybody here?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.740
Hello?

20:10.040 --> 20:12.229
Is there anybody here?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.590
Hello?

20:58.240 --> 21:00.852
Hey, hey, sorry...

21:01.400 --> 21:04.709
My car is just stuck in mud
up the road there.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.188
Whoa, are you...?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.540
Come here.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.820
Sit down.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.250
Hey, sorry, listen. Hey, are you...

21:20.840 --> 21:23.269
What happened to your neck?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.830
Okay, here, hold on...

21:34.480 --> 21:37.504
Here, look. Hey...

21:39.352 --> 21:41.140
Here...

21:41.240 --> 21:43.783
Look... Hold that there, okay?

22:59.000 --> 23:02.380
- Sarah...
- Jesus Christ! You scared the shit out of me.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.700
There's an old farmhouse
not too far down that way.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.380
- Did you find someone?
- Well, I did but he needs our help.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.384
What? What do you mean
he needs our help?

23:12.240 --> 23:13.400
Mark, what do you mean
he needs our help?

23:13.500 --> 23:16.665
I found someone who needs our help.
Will you come on?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.340
I'm just confused.
What do you mean he needs our help?

23:21.440 --> 23:23.124
Come on, will you?

23:24.000 --> 23:26.940
- Just explain what happened.
- Okay. The guy in the house, yeah?

23:27.040 --> 23:29.980
He has, like, a big cut on his neck.

23:30.080 --> 23:34.166
- What happened to him?
- I don't know. He looked... freaked out.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.540
- So what exactly did he say?
- Well, he wasn't really saying much.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.260
He was mostly mumbling. I couldn't really
make out anything he was saying, you know?

23:46.360 --> 23:48.740
Do you suppose he was
in shock or something?

23:48.840 --> 23:50.710
I don't know.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.540
Shit...

23:56.640 --> 24:00.689
You're such a dick! You're such a...
You fucking asshole...

24:09.340 --> 24:10.300
Come on.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.384
- Yep?
- Yep.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.019
What?

24:26.119 --> 24:28.460
The lights were on earlier.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.424
It's like...

24:33.000 --> 24:35.309
The door's a bit stiff.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.504
Hello?

25:58.320 --> 25:59.885
Hello?

26:04.120 --> 26:05.665
Hello?

26:09.720 --> 26:11.020
Mark, what are you doing? Mark!

26:11.120 --> 26:12.860
- Just hold on.
- You can't...

26:12.960 --> 26:14.585
Hello?

26:16.920 --> 26:20.300
- Mark!
- He's hurt, Sarah. His neck is bleeding.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.164
Hello?

26:36.960 --> 26:39.601
Hello? It's me, Mark.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.229
Come on.

26:53.640 --> 26:54.500
Mark...

26:54.600 --> 26:58.643
Sarah, he needs to go
to a fucking hospital.

27:13.280 --> 27:17.743
What are you doing? Come on.
Mark, what are you doing?

27:23.880 --> 27:26.060
- What are you doing?
- Sarah, he was just right there.

27:26.160 --> 27:29.180
- Come on, let's go. Please, let's go.
- I'm serious, he was just right here.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.380
- Will you just wait one second?
- Come on, please, let's go!

27:30.480 --> 27:32.460
- Hello? Just wait a second.
- Let's just... Let's go!

27:32.560 --> 27:34.230
Hello?

27:55.440 --> 27:58.265
Get him off! Get him off!

27:58.960 --> 28:00.742
- Sarah!
- Mark!

28:27.040 --> 28:28.790
Sarah, will you come on!

28:31.040 --> 28:32.605
Come on.

28:46.680 --> 28:50.785
Mark, this is crazy.
Can we just go? Mark!

28:51.800 --> 28:54.346
Okay, come on.
Let's just get back to the car.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.620
- This isn't the way.
- It is the way.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.420
I said it about ten minutes ago.
It still isn't the way.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.580
This is the way, now will you shut up?

29:04.680 --> 29:06.160
- You know we're lost!
- We're not lost.

29:06.260 --> 29:08.420
- This isn't the way we came!
- Sarah, it's a straight line, okay?

29:08.520 --> 29:10.620
What, the same straight line we've been
walking in for the last twenty minutes?

29:10.720 --> 29:12.500
- Will you keep walking?
- Just admit that we're lost, Mark!

29:12.600 --> 29:14.220
We're not lost!

29:14.320 --> 29:17.100
- Oh, my God...
- Sarah, I want to get back to the car.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.120
Yeah, well, you're not going
to get back there any time soon

29:19.220 --> 29:21.640
- 'cause you're not going in the right direction.
- I am going in the right fucking direction!

29:21.740 --> 29:24.400
What are you now, what,
the fucking king of the bloody bogs?

29:24.500 --> 29:27.160
- You know where you're bloody going?
- Yes, I know where I'm going!

29:27.260 --> 29:29.280
- It's a straight fucking line!
- And what? And where?

29:29.380 --> 29:32.320
- We walked here earlier on!
- We didn't come this way!

29:32.420 --> 29:34.000
- You know this? You know this?
- I know we didn't walk this way!

29:34.100 --> 29:36.928
Oh, this is your fucking back garden?
Now will you get over the ridge?

29:37.028 --> 29:39.360
- What?
- Will you walk over the fucking ridge?

29:39.460 --> 29:43.280
Sarah, it's a direct line to the car.
It's directly that way.

29:43.380 --> 29:46.340
What the fuck are you doing?
Why are you taking... What are you doing?

29:46.440 --> 29:48.240
- Why are you doing that?
- Is that fun? Yeah?

29:48.340 --> 29:50.280
- What is wrong with you?
- Point it at the shagging ground

29:50.380 --> 29:52.144
- so I can see where I'm going!
- I was!

29:56.220 --> 29:57.424
Mark?

29:58.620 --> 30:01.667
Mark? Mark?

30:03.020 --> 30:04.645
Mark?

30:07.460 --> 30:08.971
Mark?

30:09.820 --> 30:11.251
Mark!

30:26.446 --> 30:28.880
Let's get out of here, Sarah.
Something just grabbed me,

30:28.980 --> 30:31.680
something pulled me.
We need to go, Sarah, we need to go.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.514
We...

30:33.614 --> 30:37.800
We need to go. Come on, we need to go.
Sarah, get up, we need to go!

30:37.900 --> 30:39.570
Just run!

30:56.140 --> 30:57.885
Fuck!

31:02.380 --> 31:04.450
What's that thing?

31:10.460 --> 31:14.120
There's something...
There's something out there, Mark.

31:14.220 --> 31:18.920
- Sarah, we need to get out of here.
- Get down, get down.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.822
It's on the fucking bank.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.321
Mark, let's just get back
to the farmhouse.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.990
You ready?

31:31.540 --> 31:33.120
1...

31:33.620 --> 31:35.180

31:35.780 --> 31:37.320

31:56.100 --> 31:59.000
Okay, Mark, look, there!
There's the house!

31:59.100 --> 32:00.729
Okay...

32:12.980 --> 32:15.000
What the hell was that thing?

32:15.100 --> 32:17.364
Watch you head, watch your head.

32:19.780 --> 32:22.444
- Okay, which way?
- This way. Come on.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.330
Come on.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.990
Okay, let go.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.775
What the fuck?

32:47.600 --> 32:49.231
Fuck!

32:57.560 --> 32:59.544
Sarah, the door!

33:01.060 --> 33:02.685
Lock it!

33:11.300 --> 33:13.289
Mark, he's scared of the...

33:17.900 --> 33:21.004
Mark, run! Run, Mark!

33:23.980 --> 33:26.081

33:26.300 --> 33:28.250
Sarah!

33:44.420 --> 33:46.306
Shit!

34:16.320 --> 34:17.806
Mark...

34:26.900 --> 34:30.199
Mark? Mark, use your light
on your phone!

34:30.300 --> 34:33.731
Mark, use your light! Mark!

35:02.900 --> 35:04.809
Sarah!

35:20.580 --> 35:22.220
Quick!

35:24.420 --> 35:26.331
Go, go, go!

35:26.460 --> 35:27.800
Go, go, go!

35:27.900 --> 35:30.429
We'll get to the light upstairs!
Come on!

35:31.780 --> 35:34.000
Sarah, I can't, I can't...

35:34.100 --> 35:36.441
Okay, in here, in here!

35:37.100 --> 35:39.423
Oh, fuck...

Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.886
Okay.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.968
It's okay.

37:06.700 --> 37:11.640
Come on, Mark, come on.
Okay, listen to me, Mark.

37:24.940 --> 37:28.845
You'll be okay, yeah? Okay?

38:41.500 --> 38:45.567
He's gonna go through. Okay?
Let's go upstairs. Go upstairs.

38:48.460 --> 38:52.200
- Keep going.
- Okay? Up the stairs. Upstairs. Okay...

38:52.556 --> 38:54.080

38:54.180 --> 38:56.070
Come on.

39:00.031 --> 39:01.751
Fuck!

39:04.060 --> 39:05.966
Okay...

39:06.500 --> 39:10.249
Go, go! Get the light, get the light.

39:11.420 --> 39:13.649
Point it outward.

39:37.960 --> 39:40.044
What the fuck was that?

40:35.820 --> 40:38.163
Oh, shit, do you smell that?

40:39.140 --> 40:41.530
Sarah, the place is full of smoke!

40:41.940 --> 40:44.134
Sarah, he's trying to burn us out!

40:47.020 --> 40:50.044
- Sarah, what are you doing?
- Wait there. I'm going to go see.

40:50.900 --> 40:54.080
Sarah! Sarah, get back up here now!

40:54.180 --> 40:56.320
Sarah, what are you doing?!

40:56.420 --> 40:58.800
There's a stove, Mark!

40:58.900 --> 40:59.960
There's what?

41:00.060 --> 41:03.270
There's a stove.
It's smoking. It's not fire.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.400
Well, he must've blocked the chimney.

41:07.500 --> 41:11.000
I mean, the stove, it's smoking,
he's going to smoke us out.

41:11.100 --> 41:13.400
Okay, I can't see. Hand me your phone.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.648
Come on, hand me your phone!

41:20.740 --> 41:22.243
Okay.

41:23.300 --> 41:24.886
Okay.

41:49.860 --> 41:51.725
Sarah?

42:00.880 --> 42:02.930
Sarah, are you okay?

42:17.220 --> 42:18.959
Sarah?

42:19.340 --> 42:20.926
Mark!

42:25.980 --> 42:29.234
Sarah? Sarah, I can't hear you.

42:29.334 --> 42:31.211
Mark!

42:31.311 --> 42:34.141
- Sarah!
- I can't see! Mark?

46:44.160 --> 46:45.986
Mark?

46:47.700 --> 46:49.411
Mark...

46:50.300 --> 46:52.320
Mark, wake up.

46:52.420 --> 46:55.424
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up, please, wake up!

47:11.220 --> 47:13.231
How are you feeling?

47:16.980 --> 47:18.711
Babe?

47:19.060 --> 47:21.089
Fucked.

47:23.020 --> 47:26.472
Okay... Okay...

47:27.620 --> 47:30.120
We need to get out of here.

47:30.620 --> 47:35.880
No, Sarah, look, the best thing to do
is we just stay here. As soon...

47:35.980 --> 47:41.366
As soon as the sun comes up,
we run, okay?

47:54.980 --> 47:57.480
No, we can't stay here.

47:57.780 --> 48:01.000
There has to be something
that we can use, like a car or...

48:01.100 --> 48:03.370
There has to be something like...

48:12.780 --> 48:17.285
- Sarah, what's going on?
- He's out there.

48:20.900 --> 48:23.050
What's he doing?

48:25.860 --> 48:29.203
- I need a light.
- I gave it to you, Sarah.

48:39.660 --> 48:41.580
Okay...

48:41.980 --> 48:45.990
You're going to help me out. Okay?

48:49.980 --> 48:51.809
You ready?

48:54.900 --> 48:56.800
Mark, are you ready?

48:56.900 --> 48:58.604
Go.

49:00.460 --> 49:02.187

49:32.020 --> 49:33.680
Fuck...

49:33.780 --> 49:35.611
Okay...

49:46.600 --> 49:48.643
Mark, there's a tractor.

49:51.220 --> 49:53.279
It's not that far.

49:54.020 --> 49:56.680
Okay, come on. It's not that far.

49:56.780 --> 49:58.584
Come over.

See it there?

50:40.180 --> 50:41.925
Okay...

50:42.500 --> 50:46.000
Look, you're going to shine it on me.

50:46.300 --> 50:49.160
I'm going to run to the tractor
and you're going to shine it on me.

50:49.260 --> 50:51.849
Okay? And I'm going to be right back.

50:52.340 --> 50:53.880
- Just hold it there.
- Yeah.

50:53.980 --> 50:56.920
Yeah? Hear me?

50:57.020 --> 50:59.282
Okay. Okay.

Good.

51:03.900 --> 51:05.689
Ready?

51:31.120 --> 51:32.885
Fuck...

51:37.040 --> 51:39.488
Okay, I'm at the back door!

51:44.100 --> 51:46.489
Okay, just keep it on me, yeah?

52:47.420 --> 52:50.409
Mark! Mark, turn it back on!

52:51.060 --> 52:53.800
Mark, the light! Turn it back on!

52:53.900 --> 52:55.645
Mark!

53:11.980 --> 53:13.770
Fuck...

Oh, my God!

55:02.360 --> 55:04.240
Come on, Mark.

55:04.540 --> 55:07.160
Okay, I got the tractor.
We need to go now.

55:07.260 --> 55:08.880
Come on, give me your hand.

55:08.980 --> 55:10.960
Come on. Stand up.

55:11.060 --> 55:13.428

- Come on, let's go.

55:19.400 --> 55:21.265
That's it.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.909
Just a few more steps...

55:27.300 --> 55:29.106
Come on.

55:31.300 --> 55:32.931
Okay.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.011
Oh, shit.

Oh, fuck. Shit.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.151
Okay, Mark. Nearly there.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.800
Okay.

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:45.151
Sarah, leave the fucking room now!
