16:50.267 --> 16:52.534
- FROM THEN ON, DEPTH CHARGE HUNTED PROTOFORM X.

16:52.634 --> 16:54.134
AFTER FOUR STELLAR CYCLES,

16:54.234 --> 16:56.501
HE BROUGHT HIM BACK TO CYBERTRON.

16:56.601 --> 17:00.434
HE ASKED THE HIGH COUNCIL TO FIND A WAY TO DESTROY HIS SPARK.

17:00.535 --> 17:03.335
- THEY TURNED HIM OVER TO US INSTEAD.

17:03.435 --> 17:07.203
DEPTH CHARGE WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH THE DECISION.

17:07.303 --> 17:08.836
- EH, SO HE'S GOT A LOT OF ANGST.

17:08.936 --> 17:11.370
THE QUESTION IS, HOW'D HE GET HERE?

17:11.470 --> 17:13.803
- REPAIR CYCLE COMPLETE.

17:13.904 --> 17:19.671
- NOW'S OUR CHANCE TO ASK.

[steam hisses]

17:36.308 --> 17:39.742

17:39.842 --> 17:43.409
- I GUESS I'VE CHANGED SINCE WE LAST MET, DEPTH CHARGE.

17:43.509 --> 17:45.342
- PRIMAL!

17:45.442 --> 17:50.910
- ALERT. PROTOFORM X STILL FUNCTIONAL.

17:52.243 --> 17:53.243
- I'M CHEETOR.

17:53.343 --> 17:55.044
THANKS FOR PULLING ME OUT OF THE WATER.

17:55.144 --> 17:56.444
- GO CHASE A MOUSE.

17:56.545 --> 18:01.445
[clangs] - UNH!

18:03.412 --> 18:05.079

18:05.178 --> 18:08.746
TALK ABOUT RUDE.

18:08.846 --> 18:13.547
- DEPTH CHARGE.

18:13.647 --> 18:16.080
- WHY ARE YOU HERE, PRIMAL?

18:16.180 --> 18:19.614
- WE WERE ABOUT TO ASK YOU THE SAME THING.

18:19.714 --> 18:21.415
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

18:21.515 --> 18:24.216
SOME KIND OF ANOMALY TRASHED MY SHIP.

18:24.315 --> 18:27.650
I WAS SEARCHING THE GALAXY FOR YOUR MISTAKE.

18:27.750 --> 18:30.250

18:30.349 --> 18:31.816
- GOOD.

18:31.917 --> 18:35.083
THEN X IS MINE AGAIN.

18:35.183 --> 18:36.617
- WAIT!

18:36.717 --> 18:38.118
- BACK OFF, PRIMAL!

18:38.218 --> 18:39.251
YOU BLEW IT.

18:39.351 --> 18:42.818
JUST LIKE I TOLD THE HIGH COUNCIL YOU WOULD.

18:42.919 --> 18:44.885
- STUBBORN AS EVER.

18:44.985 --> 18:46.386
- LET HIM GO.

18:46.486 --> 18:48.819
THE PREDS WILL CHANGE HIS MIND.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.353
OR MAKE HIM INTO FISH STICKS.

18:50.453 --> 18:52.053

18:52.153 --> 18:55.687
BUT HE'S STILL MAXIMAL.

18:59.922 --> 19:01.555
- [gasps]

19:01.655 --> 19:05.722
IT CAN'T BE.

19:05.822 --> 19:07.423
IT'S THE ARK.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.190
AND THIS IS EARTH.

19:09.290 --> 19:12.024
YOU'VE TRAVELED BACK IN TIME.

19:12.124 --> 19:14.657
- YEAH, A FEW MILLION STELLAR CYCLES BACK IN TIME.

19:14.757 --> 19:17.157
[chuckles] AND MEGATRON AND HIS PREDS

19:17.257 --> 19:19.658

19:31.526 --> 19:36.195
NOW, WHERE'S THE WAY OUT?

19:36.294 --> 19:38.328
- WHAT'S WITH HIM?

19:38.428 --> 19:40.261
- EH, PROBABLY RUST.

19:40.361 --> 19:43.895
- DEPTH CHARGE, LET IT GO!

19:50.963 --> 19:53.697
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT X DID ON OMICRON,

19:53.797 --> 19:55.031
AND NEITHER AM I.

19:55.131 --> 19:58.364
STOP LOOKING FOR REVENGE AND DO SOMETHING TO HELP.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.965
- IT'S NOT REVENGE I'M LOOKING FOR.

20:01.065 --> 20:02.998
IT'S JUSTICE.

20:25.835 --> 20:27.503
THERE ARE SIX OF THEM.

20:29.503 --> 20:32.803
WHEN YOU SCREW UP, YOU DO IT BIG TIME.

20:32.903 --> 20:35.003
BUT THANKS FOR THE TIP.

20:42.505 --> 20:44.638
- SO, YOU THINK HE'LL COME BACK?

20:44.738 --> 20:47.706
- THERE WAS A TIME HE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT.

20:47.806 --> 20:52.240
RAMPAGE CHANGED THAT.
