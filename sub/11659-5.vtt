00:55.900 --> 00:57.266
Hi, Ma.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.266
What are you making?

01:00.333 --> 01:01.433
History.

01:02.433 --> 01:05.467
You finally perfected
your nonrolling meatball?

01:05.533 --> 01:07.600
Just because
you have the chin

01:07.667 --> 01:09.266
doesn't mean you're Jay Leno.

01:11.934 --> 01:15.567
Ooh, what smells so good
in here besides me?

01:17.233 --> 01:18.600
Lasagna A La Sophia.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.633
It's for the Daughters of Italy
cooking contest.

01:22.133 --> 01:25.700
All right, all right.
You twisted my arm.

01:29.734 --> 01:31.767
-It's good.
-It's delicious.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.200
It's garbage.

01:34.367 --> 01:37.133
-What are you talking about?
-You can't fool me.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.200
I watched your faces.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.800
-Neither one of you got the look.
-What look?

01:40.867 --> 01:43.400
The look every cook
dreams about.

01:43.467 --> 01:46.133
The look of total,
instant pleasure.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.266
Your father put that look
on my face once.

01:50.467 --> 01:51.400
That's nice, Ma.

01:51.900 --> 01:55.433
Nice? I said once.
We were married 52 years.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.133
The mail's here.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.834
Rose, what's wrong?

02:00.900 --> 02:03.300
Nothing. Just a letter I got.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.700
It's bad news.

02:04.767 --> 02:07.900
That's eerie.
I had the same feeling.

02:11.867 --> 02:15.533
My aunt Gretchen
in fort Lauderdale died.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.633
Honey, I'm sorry.
Were you close to her?

02:18.700 --> 02:20.934
No. I couldn't stand her.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.633
Wait a minute, Rose.

02:27.700 --> 02:31.633
If you didn't like her,
why are you so upset?

02:31.700 --> 02:34.800
Because I have to
speak at her funeral.

02:34.867 --> 02:37.467
I'm terrified of speaking
in front of people.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.767
It's my biggest fear.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.867
Why can't somebody else speak?

02:40.934 --> 02:43.166
<i>Genochtenlochen.</i>

02:45.800 --> 02:47.967
It's a family tradition.

02:48.033 --> 02:51.266
The oldest niece
has to give the eulogy.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.266
Well, not literally.

02:53.333 --> 02:56.800
Literally, it's a herring poacher
you can wear as a sun visor.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.934
But the family decided
that was close enough.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.600
I take it no member of your family

03:04.667 --> 03:07.600
was ever a returning
champion on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

03:12.567 --> 03:14.667
Anyway, that's why I have to speak.

03:14.734 --> 03:17.200
I've dreaded this day.
I just can't do it.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.233
Rose, calm down.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.633
I know a way to get through this.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.734
The way to relax when you have
to speak to a group of people

03:26.800 --> 03:30.233
is to imagine what they
all look like naked.

03:34.967 --> 03:36.233
-Really?
-Yep.

03:36.300 --> 03:40.166
And if you do it right,
you'll probably even start to laugh.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.400
(laughing)

03:55.867 --> 03:58.200
(both laughing)

04:11.467 --> 04:14.266
Hi, Ma.
Hey, what is that smell?

04:14.333 --> 04:16.533
The sweet smell of success.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.800
It's my new entry
in the cooking contest.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.266
Veal parmigiana,
my luckiest dish.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.066
It saved my marriage.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.667
You're going to tell a story?

04:24.734 --> 04:27.333
Please.
Does Heifetz Rosin a bow?

04:28.767 --> 04:30.900
This is a tear-jerker.

04:30.967 --> 04:32.967
Picture this.

04:33.033 --> 04:36.100
New York city, 1931.
The depression.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.867
Your father and I are newlyweds.

04:37.934 --> 04:40.200
One rainy night
we have our first fight.

04:40.266 --> 04:42.233
He says he's leaving,
I say "fine."

04:42.300 --> 04:44.000
He goes out the door.
I start to cook.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.867
A little later he comes back.

04:47.934 --> 04:50.734
He says he couldn't find a cab.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.533
We eat in silence.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.800
Halfway through,
he's got tears in his eyes.

04:55.867 --> 05:00.233
He tells me
this meal is like our marriage.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.300
The veal is like him,
tough and stubborn.

05:03.367 --> 05:05.700
The tomato sauce is like me,
hot and spicy.

05:07.233 --> 05:09.600
And the mozzarella
is like our love.

05:09.667 --> 05:12.300
It stretches but never breaks.

05:12.367 --> 05:16.367
I don't see what luck
had to do with it.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.834
You were conceived that night.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.233
Ma...

05:21.300 --> 05:23.266
What's lucky is
your father never knew,

05:23.333 --> 05:25.266
or he never would've
eaten my veal again.

05:29.867 --> 05:32.467
Honey, you'll just do fine.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.867
I remember the last time
I gave a speech.

05:35.934 --> 05:37.333
I was in high school.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.734
Do you want to hear about it?

05:38.800 --> 05:41.200
Would you follow us
if we tried to run for it?

05:42.266 --> 05:43.133
Yes.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.767
You were saying?

05:45.834 --> 05:49.934
It was my high school graduation.
I was valedictorian.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.667
You were a valedictorian?

05:51.734 --> 05:56.533
Yes. I was fourth out of 19
graduating seniors.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.633
-Anyway--
-Wait, wait.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.400
If you were fourth, how were
you chosen valedictorian?

06:03.467 --> 06:07.033
The same way every high school
chooses the valedictorian.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.367
We drew straws.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.233
And you picked
the biggest one?

06:12.300 --> 06:13.834
I don't like to brag.

06:14.967 --> 06:18.700
Anyway,
the topic of my speech was,

06:18.767 --> 06:20.567
"There's a big world out there,

06:20.633 --> 06:23.233
but you have to change buses
in Tyler's landing

06:23.300 --> 06:24.266
if you want to see it."

06:26.867 --> 06:29.633
Graduation day came,
and everybody was there.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.333
The mayor was there, his wife,

06:32.400 --> 06:35.667
old Johansen, young Johansen,

06:35.734 --> 06:38.100
big and little Gustav,

06:38.166 --> 06:40.834
the Stringmyer twins, fat Jerry--

06:40.900 --> 06:43.834
Will you get to the point?

06:43.900 --> 06:47.266
The point is I choked, wimped out,
froze on the spot.

06:47.333 --> 06:50.867
Since then I've never spoken
in front of a crowd.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.734
Next time
we try and outrun her.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.266
You're not the only one
who's gone through this.

07:01.333 --> 07:02.934
I had a phobia too.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.567
You, afraid of something?

07:05.633 --> 07:08.467
A big old strong, strapping thing
like you?

07:09.367 --> 07:11.166
Who am I, Joe Frazier?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.700
I had a fear of flying.

07:15.767 --> 07:19.900
When my sister Gloria got married
in California, I had to go.

07:19.967 --> 07:24.066
So I got some therapy,
and it worked.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.967
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

07:26.033 --> 07:29.000
Everybody is
afraid of something.

07:29.066 --> 07:30.734
What are you afraid of, Blanche?

07:30.800 --> 07:31.967
Nothing.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.700
You're a real team player,
aren't you?

07:37.200 --> 07:40.433
I'm not afraid of anything now,
but I used to be.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.767
Not a phobia exactly,
but something just as bad,

07:43.834 --> 07:45.767
a recurring dream.

07:45.834 --> 07:48.300
Night after night
I had this awful dream.

07:48.367 --> 07:51.834
I was trapped in an enclosed space
full of men.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.133
Now, what could that mean?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.700
-Let's give this a second.
-Wait a minute.

08:01.767 --> 08:03.433
There's more to it.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.667
All the men were bald.

08:06.633 --> 08:09.266
Just me and a bunch
of bald men.

08:10.266 --> 08:12.400
And I kept hearing
the voice of God.

08:13.734 --> 08:15.834
Anyway,
one day I finally said to myself,

08:15.900 --> 08:20.367
"You don't have
to succumb to any dream.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.400
Unless it involves meeting
Mel Gibson at an Oyster bar."

08:24.400 --> 08:26.266
And just like that it stopped.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.667
Mind over matter.
You can do it too.

08:28.734 --> 08:31.100
-I don't know.
-Of course, you can.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.900
-You just have to think positively.
-That's right.

08:33.967 --> 08:36.767
Go to your room,
and start working on your speech.

08:36.834 --> 08:40.467
Then you can try it
on me and Dorothy.

08:40.533 --> 08:44.400
-Ok.
-Go on. Go on.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.533
You know,
I'm glad I'm not in her shoes.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.834
Oh, I'd hate to have
to give a eulogy.

08:56.266 --> 08:58.100
What if it was my eulogy?

09:00.934 --> 09:01.633
What?

09:01.700 --> 09:04.333
What if you were giving
a eulogy for me?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.000
What would you say?

09:06.066 --> 09:10.100
-Come on, Blanche.
-I'm serious, Dorothy.

09:10.166 --> 09:11.967
What would you say?

09:12.033 --> 09:19.033
Well, I... I guess I'd say you were
a lovely, generous person, and...

09:19.600 --> 09:22.300
one of the best friends I ever had.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.100
Nothing about my looks?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.467
I'd say you were one
of the prettiest friends--

09:29.533 --> 09:32.567
-One of?
-The, Blanche.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.433
The prettiest.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.066
What would you say about me?

09:37.133 --> 09:38.500
Dorothy, come on.

09:38.567 --> 09:41.500
I told you. You can tell me.

09:42.600 --> 09:48.266
Well, I would say I always felt safe
having you in the house.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.934
And I would say I always
enjoyed talking to you

10:00.000 --> 10:03.567
when I'd come home from one of
my numerous dates.

10:03.633 --> 10:06.567
And I would say

10:06.633 --> 10:10.400
I always looked up to you
like an older sister.

10:13.967 --> 10:17.100
Thank you, Blanche.

10:17.166 --> 10:21.300
Oh, and I forgot one thing.
I would also say you're fat.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.567
I'm ready to
practice my eulogy.

10:40.633 --> 10:42.834
Blanche, stand by the barbecue.

10:42.900 --> 10:45.033
-That's where aunt Liv will be.
-Where should I would be?

10:45.100 --> 10:48.100
Dorothy, there,
where uncle Gunther will be.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.533
And you should hum.

10:50.033 --> 10:53.066
Is that part of the Viking funeral?

10:53.567 --> 10:55.567
No, uncle Gunther
just hums a lot.

10:55.633 --> 10:59.000
If he has something important
to say he spells it out in salt.

11:00.633 --> 11:03.400
Unless he's quoting
a song by the four tops,

11:03.467 --> 11:05.567
-then he spells it out in...
-Pepper.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.867
Can we just get on
with the speech?

11:09.934 --> 11:11.066
Okay.

11:13.066 --> 11:18.600
Friends, family,
aunt Gretchen was a special person.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.533
She...

11:22.233 --> 11:26.767
-I can't do this!
-You were doing just fine.

11:26.834 --> 11:28.734
That's because
you were here.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.100
Tomorrow I'll be alone
with my relatives,

11:32.166 --> 11:35.900
who will hoot and snicker
if my voice cracks.

11:35.967 --> 11:37.333
They'll think I'm an idiot.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.266
Please. It's family.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.734
They know you're an idiot.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.800
There's only one way
I'll get through this,

11:45.867 --> 11:48.400
if you two come
with me for support.

11:48.467 --> 11:50.166
Will you do it?

11:50.233 --> 11:52.900
Please, Blanche.
Please, Dorothy.

11:52.967 --> 11:56.600
-Please, Blanche.
-I will if Dorothy will.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.133
Please!

11:58.200 --> 12:00.767
(mouthing) No.

12:02.033 --> 12:05.633
Well, if you really think
it will help, we'll do it.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.800
Thank you.

12:06.867 --> 12:09.900
You're the best friends
I've ever had.

12:09.967 --> 12:13.433
I better make
the plane reservations.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
Plane reservations?

12:15.567 --> 12:17.533
I thought her aunt
lived in fort Lauderdale.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.834
She did.

12:18.900 --> 12:22.066
She's being buried in the Bahamas
where she spent her winters.

12:22.133 --> 12:25.500
I don't have one thing in black
that isn't see-through.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.433
It's good you got over
your fear of flying.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.567
Oh, right.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.600
How you carried on!

12:35.667 --> 12:39.300
Remember your uncle Michael's
wedding in Arizona?

12:39.367 --> 12:40.734
Before we boarded the plane,

12:40.800 --> 12:43.233
you threw yourself
on the ground screaming.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.233
It was a little embarrassing.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.867
I'll say. You were 48 years old.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.166
That's all behind me now.

12:51.233 --> 12:54.266
I really feel very
comfortable on planes.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.600
Good. Because you'll probably
take a dinky plane.

12:57.667 --> 13:01.834
They flutter.
They shimmy. They wobble.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.333
You got a lot of guts.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.033
-I'm proud of you.
-Thanks, Ma.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.266
Please don't let them take me!

13:19.266 --> 13:20.367
What are you reading, Blanche?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.166
Oh, I'm checking on the
weather in the Bahamas.

13:22.233 --> 13:25.367
It's gonna be in the upper 80s
with a nice gentle breeze.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.800
So with that outdoor service,

13:26.867 --> 13:28.333
we'll come away with
some healthy color.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.700
Aunt gretchen
always loved the sun.

13:30.767 --> 13:33.567
Well, maybe
they'll have an open casket.

13:42.467 --> 13:43.967
Girls, I have some bad news.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.900
I am not going to be
able to go with you.

13:45.967 --> 13:48.367
-Why not?
-It's ma. She's sick.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.133
I'm gonna have to take
her to the hospital.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.033
Dorothy, wait a minute.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.133
She left for that
cooking contest

13:54.200 --> 13:55.800
-about 10 minutes ago.
-Yeah, she called.

13:55.867 --> 13:58.834
She had a bad canolli
when she got there.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.734
Right now she is doubled over
with cramps, crying with pain,

14:03.800 --> 14:08.066
and making the most spectacular
comeback since Dennis Hopper.

14:09.467 --> 14:12.500
-Are you all right, Sophia?
-Of course, I'm all right.

14:12.567 --> 14:15.767
It's just halfway to the contest
I realized I forgot the wine.

14:15.834 --> 14:18.467
-For your mussels marinara?
-No, for me.

14:18.533 --> 14:22.567
I always drink wine during cooking
contests and <i>My Sister Sam.</i>

14:25.033 --> 14:27.767
Dorothy, Sophia's not sick.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.033
She didn't eat a bad canolli.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.066
So whoever called
and said that

14:32.133 --> 14:33.700
was just making
the whole thing up.

14:37.567 --> 14:40.066
Rose, Dorothy made
the whole thing up.

14:40.133 --> 14:41.667
She doesn't want
to go with us.

14:41.734 --> 14:46.000
-Well, you promised you'd go.
-I know, that's what I said.

14:46.066 --> 14:48.367
All I can say now is "tough."

14:49.433 --> 14:51.734
I'm not getting on that plane
and you can't make me.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.567
Well, then I'm not going either.

14:53.633 --> 14:57.333
Oh, I don't believe my ears.

14:57.400 --> 15:01.767
Girls, the entire purpose of this
trip is to conquer our fears.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.000
Why, if we back out now,

15:03.066 --> 15:05.133
that'll mean our fears
have conquered us.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.900
And I will not allow that.

15:06.967 --> 15:09.200
We are going to march
out that door right now.

15:09.266 --> 15:12.266
Like the strong, confident
women I know we are.

15:12.333 --> 15:15.033
Chins up, chest out, buttocks tight.

15:17.266 --> 15:18.967
I know "buttocks tight"
has nothing to do with it,

15:19.033 --> 15:21.166
it just looks good.

15:21.233 --> 15:22.700
Buttocks tight, I said.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.867
Buttocks tight.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.033
Oh, forget it.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.266
I'm so proud of you.

15:36.333 --> 15:39.934
Nobody would dream you
have a fear of flying.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.934
Unless they glance
at the bruises on my forearm.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.367
You think you could hold
onto something else?

15:49.433 --> 15:51.467
Of course, honey.
I'm sorry.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.800
-I meant like the armrest.
-Oh.

15:58.867 --> 16:01.900
Look, girls.
I found this big bolt.

16:01.967 --> 16:04.500
-Where does it go?
-With me off this plane.

16:04.567 --> 16:05.633
(clunk)

16:05.700 --> 16:07.734
-What's that?
-The door.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.066
They shut the door?

16:10.734 --> 16:13.100
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.700
My name is Candy.

16:14.767 --> 16:17.066
I'll be your flight hostess.

16:19.900 --> 16:23.367
Please review the information cards
in your seat pockets

16:23.433 --> 16:27.333
for the safety information
in the unlikely event

16:27.400 --> 16:31.400
-of a mishap during our flight.
-What did she mean by mishap?

16:31.467 --> 16:35.600
She means bad movies
or cold food or running out of ice.

16:35.667 --> 16:38.266
-Running out of gas.
-Oh, my God.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.633
Will you calm down?
Here, drink some champagne.

16:41.700 --> 16:44.734
-I don't like champagne.
-Go ahead. It might relax you.

16:55.166 --> 16:58.300
It didn't relax me.
It makes me burp.

16:59.834 --> 17:02.233
I'll probably burp, and the cabin
pressure will change

17:02.300 --> 17:04.266
and we'll fly into a mountain.

17:04.767 --> 17:07.500
That's a good example
of a mishap.

17:08.700 --> 17:11.100
Do me a favor.
Fasten your seat belt...

17:11.734 --> 17:12.800
over your mouth!

17:14.133 --> 17:18.000
Rose, let's use our time constructively
and work on your eulogy.

17:18.066 --> 17:19.200
What will you say?

17:19.266 --> 17:21.400
I don't know.

17:21.467 --> 17:25.266
I'll probably start out talking
about aunt Gretchen, the person.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.900
-She was a very rigid person.
-Especially now.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.633
I'm sorry.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.500
I guess maybe
that champagne did relax me.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.500
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, girls.

17:43.567 --> 17:45.300
Oh, my God.
Look! Look! Look!

17:45.367 --> 17:47.934
All the men are bald.

17:59.567 --> 18:00.800
It's all right, Blanche.

18:00.867 --> 18:03.734
The captain turned off
the "no bald men" sign.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.467
I'm talking about
my recurring dream.

18:12.533 --> 18:13.400
Remember?

18:13.467 --> 18:16.500
I'm trapped in an enclosed space
full of bald men?

18:16.567 --> 18:18.567
I didn't tell you the rest.

18:18.633 --> 18:22.834
We're on a plane,
and we fly into the ocean.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.633
Oh, come on now.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.100
You're behaving just as
crazy as we are.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.433
It's just a coincidence.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.667
(Stewardess)
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:30.734 --> 18:33.433
be sure your seat belts
are securely fastened

18:33.500 --> 18:35.100
in preparation for takeoff.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.700
And if anyone found a big bolt,
please return it to me.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.600
It came off the... beverage cart.

18:43.667 --> 18:46.066
Yes, that's it,
the beverage cart.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.033
Dorothy, it's not a coincidence.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.333
It's my nightmare.
It's coming true.

18:57.400 --> 19:00.800
It's not all coming true.

19:00.867 --> 19:02.367
You haven't heard
the voice of God.

19:02.433 --> 19:03.533
That's right.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.300
(Lord on pa) <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is captain Lord speaking.</i>

19:07.767 --> 19:10.133
<i>I hope you enjoy your flight.</i>

19:25.100 --> 19:26.633
-Dorothy?
-We made a rule.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.700
No talking.
It shakes the plane.

19:32.266 --> 19:34.667
I just have to say one thing.

19:34.734 --> 19:38.567
If Blanche is right and
we are going to die this afternoon,

19:38.633 --> 19:39.834
I'm glad we're together.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.567
Yes, that's very comforting.
Now, shut up.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.834
I know what you mean, Rose.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.033
We have had some very
special times together.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.667
Like the time there was that
hurricane and all the power went out

19:54.734 --> 19:57.033
and we huddled
together to keep warm

19:57.100 --> 20:01.200
and sang campfire songs
and told stories.

20:01.266 --> 20:05.200
And Rose admitted that Charlie was
the only man she ever slept with.

20:05.266 --> 20:08.667
You admitted Stan was
the only man you slept with.

20:08.734 --> 20:11.500
And I admitted my shoe size
was really 5 1/2.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.000
I wish we had
more time together.

20:18.066 --> 20:20.133
Wait! What are we doing?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.033
The flight's been smooth.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.066
There hasn't been
any turbulence.

20:24.133 --> 20:25.667
(Lord on pa)
<i>This is captain Lord again.</i>

20:25.734 --> 20:28.333
<i>Looks like we're running</i>
<i>right into the eyeteeth</i>

20:28.400 --> 20:30.800
<i>of a tropical storm.</i>

20:30.867 --> 20:32.433
I'm a dead woman.

20:34.433 --> 20:37.200
<i>Unfortunately, that means</i>
<i>we're going to turn around</i>

20:37.266 --> 20:38.367
<i>and return to Miami.</i>

20:38.433 --> 20:40.100
<i>I'm sorry for the inconvenience.</i>

20:40.166 --> 20:42.033
Did you hear that, girls?
We're saved.

20:42.100 --> 20:43.467
What do you mean?

20:43.533 --> 20:46.400
That part wasn't in my dream.
The dream's broken.

20:46.467 --> 20:48.767
We'll be all right!

20:48.834 --> 20:52.266
You faced your fears.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.166
Dorothy got on the plane.
You faced your dream.

20:54.233 --> 20:55.767
I didn't give my speech.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.467
Give it now.

20:57.533 --> 21:02.567
Yep... yes... you wrote it,
you give it. You can do it!

21:12.700 --> 21:13.900
Everyone?

21:16.433 --> 21:20.767
I was supposed to speak
at a funeral, and now I can't.

21:20.834 --> 21:24.100
But I'd still like
to give my speech.

21:25.266 --> 21:28.900
I wrote some things down,
but I'd just rather talk.

21:28.967 --> 21:32.400
The funeral was for
my aunt Gretchen.

21:32.467 --> 21:33.734
I didn't know her very well.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.767
All I remember is,
she used to scare me...

21:38.066 --> 21:41.367
jumping out
of my closet at night,

21:41.433 --> 21:44.734
putting false fangs
in her mouth,

21:44.800 --> 21:47.033
sometimes baying at the moon.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.467
Now her dying scares me.

21:51.533 --> 21:54.700
But there's a good part
to being scared.

21:54.767 --> 21:57.133
You get to know
who your friends are.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.800
They're the ones who
help you not be scared.

22:00.867 --> 22:04.266
Maybe that's what aunt Gretchen
was trying to do,

22:04.333 --> 22:06.066
help me not be scared.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.567
I think so.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.400
Goodbye, aunt Gretchen.

22:11.467 --> 22:14.033
(applause)

22:15.467 --> 22:19.166
Take a seat, lady.
This isn't the Copacabana.

22:21.867 --> 22:24.867
-Rose, that was beautiful.
-It was. It truly was.

22:24.934 --> 22:27.900
(Lord on pa) <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is captain Lord again.</i>

22:27.967 --> 22:33.700
<i>If you all look out the left side of</i>
<i>our aircraft, it will tip over.</i>

22:37.533 --> 22:39.333
<i>Sorry.</i>

22:39.400 --> 22:42.200
<i>Just a little</i>
<i>small airplane pilot humor.</i>

22:48.233 --> 22:50.300
(door opens)

22:50.367 --> 22:51.734
Hi, Ma!

22:51.800 --> 22:54.533
What the hell
are you doing home?

22:54.600 --> 22:57.033
Let's not get all mushy.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.633
-You chickened out, didn't you?
-No, we went.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.567
At least we started to.

23:01.633 --> 23:05.800
We ran into a tropical storm,
so we turned around.

23:05.867 --> 23:08.767
And the plane was
full of bald men.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.200
They were all
former Mr. Cleans

23:11.266 --> 23:13.433
going to a reunion
in the Bahamas.

23:15.433 --> 23:18.734
So tell us about
the cooking contest.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.800
The competition was fierce.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.400
It came down
to my mussels marinara

23:23.467 --> 23:25.533
and Louise Polito's
chicken cacciatore.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.867
Louise Polito.

23:26.934 --> 23:30.834
Isn't she the one who brags about
being Al Capone's piano teacher?

23:31.333 --> 23:33.734
True, 103 years old.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.066
Anyway, the judges voted.
It was a flatfooted tie.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.533
That's when it went
into sudden death.

23:38.600 --> 23:39.700
And?

23:39.767 --> 23:42.033
I told you.
It was sudden death.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.800
Louise couldn't take it.
She keeled over.

23:44.867 --> 23:46.066
Kaput!

23:47.333 --> 23:48.633
Her funeral is on Saturday.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.700
Sophia, that's terrible.

23:50.767 --> 23:52.300
You think that's bad?

23:52.367 --> 23:55.300
Guess who I volunteered
to give the eulogy?

24:03.767 --> 24:08.367
(theme music playing)
