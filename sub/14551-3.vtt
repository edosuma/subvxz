00:07.128 --> 00:09.044
Previously on Powers...

00:09.936 --> 00:11.559
It's Olympia.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.560
Whatever was in this envelope
was also in his blood stream.

00:14.561 --> 00:15.560
I killed Bug.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.060
This is my signed confession.

00:17.660 --> 00:20.460
- You know her?
- Calista. Just a Wannabe.

00:20.494 --> 00:21.716
- What do you do?
- I do stuff with light.

00:21.728 --> 00:23.559
- Yeah.
- My name's Zora.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.560
- No, no!
- Why were you on that roof?

00:25.671 --> 00:27.451
Walker, he pushed me.

00:27.466 --> 00:29.465
I caught you falling
in the arms of a man

00:29.466 --> 00:31.465
with whom I share an
incredibly complicated history.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.793
I know she's lying.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.904
I've spent all day listening to her lies

00:34.908 --> 00:37.004
and waiting for you to
either call or come by.

00:37.005 --> 00:38.193
I left a message.

00:38.259 --> 00:40.093
On the number that I used to...

00:40.259 --> 00:42.466
- The old number.
- I don't use that number anymore.

00:42.467 --> 00:43.465
I had these lucky ties.

00:43.466 --> 00:45.465
Only have one left, and I can't find it.

00:45.466 --> 00:47.466
Your tie, it's askew.

00:47.466 --> 00:49.884
I'm here to register my powers as law...

00:53.466 --> 00:55.301
Can't an old friend pop by?

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:36.466 --> 01:40.466
Blue Magma. I have an offer of clemency.

01:41.177 --> 01:42.467
They'll never let me out of here.

01:42.468 --> 01:44.385
They will.

01:44.392 --> 01:47.392
If you do something to atone
for the people you incinerated.

01:48.392 --> 01:50.391
What's the offer?

01:50.392 --> 01:52.392
An experimental treatment.

01:53.392 --> 01:54.392
What treatment?

01:55.392 --> 01:56.392
Classified.

01:58.392 --> 01:59.391
What do I do?

01:59.392 --> 02:01.391
To participate in the trial,

02:01.392 --> 02:04.311
all you have to do is attack me.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.392
Fuck you, Triphammer.

02:08.393 --> 02:11.391
You're not gonna test
some new weapon on me.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.392
My weapons and my armor
have nothing to do with it.

02:52.392 --> 02:54.391
Ronnie,

02:54.392 --> 02:57.391
you wanted to be a hero,
but you weren't good at it.

02:57.392 --> 02:58.392
People died.

02:58.392 --> 03:02.392
Now you have a chance to make
up for the misery you caused.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.935
All you have to do is take a shot

03:06.102 --> 03:07.392
at the guy who put you in here.

03:08.392 --> 03:10.391
That,

03:10.392 --> 03:13.392
or spend your life thinking
of the kids you killed.

03:34.392 --> 03:36.392
It's gone.

03:39.392 --> 03:41.392
The fire is gone.

03:43.487 --> 03:46.655
You put the fire out. You put the fire out.

03:46.780 --> 03:48.487
I put the fire out.

04:02.898 --> 04:05.814
Fuck! Fucking fuck!

04:14.815 --> 04:16.814
You're close, Harley.

04:18.274 --> 04:19.690
Another one.

04:19.814 --> 04:21.814
I killed another one.

04:28.753 --> 04:29.753
What does it feel like?

04:30.753 --> 04:32.753
It doesn't feel like anything to me.

04:33.963 --> 04:36.255
I don't have powers.

04:36.421 --> 04:38.129
But I expect it makes them feel

04:38.296 --> 04:40.753
like I feel without my armor.

04:43.171 --> 04:44.296
Helpless.

04:47.171 --> 04:48.753
And then it kills them.

04:49.753 --> 04:51.753
Blue Magma, Ronnie Marquez,

04:54.753 --> 04:55.796
he had kids.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.963
I have kids.

04:58.088 --> 05:00.505
You remember what you said to me about them

05:00.630 --> 05:03.753
the day you came to me with
the idea of the Drainer?

05:03.754 --> 05:05.752
You remember what you
said would happen to them

05:05.753 --> 05:07.753
if we didn't try to make this a reality?

05:08.753 --> 05:10.752
You said they would all die.

05:10.753 --> 05:13.753
You said 50 years was the
most they could hope for.

05:13.753 --> 05:14.754
You came to my home

05:14.879 --> 05:18.588
and you pronounced a
death sentence on my kids,

05:18.713 --> 05:20.752
on every child in the
world, within 50 years,

05:20.753 --> 05:22.171
if we didn't do this.

05:23.753 --> 05:25.752
I have never once, since that day,

05:25.753 --> 05:28.630
allowed myself the liberty
of feeling powerless.

05:30.753 --> 05:32.753
Look at you.

05:32.753 --> 05:35.753
The price you've paid to battle monsters.

05:37.653 --> 05:39.050
Are you done with that now?

05:43.226 --> 05:50.573

05:52.753 --> 05:53.753
You know the guy?

05:54.753 --> 05:56.553
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

05:56.565 --> 05:58.752
Fucker just fell out of the sky. Boom.

05:58.753 --> 06:00.752
Thank fuck no one was inside.

06:00.753 --> 06:03.753
Jesus shit. My son's not
much younger than him.

06:05.380 --> 06:06.752
You sure you got this?

06:06.753 --> 06:07.753
Yeah, we got it.

06:07.796 --> 06:10.753
Thanks. The younger
ones, I can't, you know?

06:11.753 --> 06:13.753
Partner's a class act.

06:15.753 --> 06:16.753
You look like shit.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.753
He brought it back.

06:20.753 --> 06:22.752
I was up all night

06:22.753 --> 06:27.753
just sitting there with my
gun hoping he'd come again.

06:28.753 --> 06:30.752
- Pass this clusterfuck back to Golden.
- Well, hey.

06:30.753 --> 06:33.338
Let's go to that asshole's
club and find Calista.

06:33.463 --> 06:35.753
- Hey...
- I got him on breaking and entering.

06:37.753 --> 06:39.752
- You wanna see a dead body?
- No.

06:39.753 --> 06:41.837
I want to find Calista and bust Royalle.

06:42.753 --> 06:43.753
Come take a look.

06:46.253 --> 06:48.837
Shit. That's the kid who was with Zora.

06:49.004 --> 06:50.752
I didn't think he was a flier.

06:50.753 --> 06:52.753
He has a registered powers profile.

06:53.753 --> 06:55.752
"Levitation Boy. Maurice St. Clair.

06:55.753 --> 06:57.752
Max vertical lift is three feet,

06:57.753 --> 06:58.753
no propulsion."

07:01.648 --> 07:04.691
For his body to do this much
damage and still remain intact,

07:04.816 --> 07:06.647
he couldn't have reached terminal velocity.

07:06.648 --> 07:10.647
He must have been falling
for five, six seconds.

07:10.648 --> 07:13.648
So that's, maybe, 500 feet.

07:13.858 --> 07:15.647
He dropped from a plane?

07:15.648 --> 07:16.647
No.

07:16.648 --> 07:18.647
This is Class B airspace.

07:18.648 --> 07:21.288
Even the smallest planes have to
fly between 6,000 and 10,000 feet.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.647
Look at the big brain on you.

07:23.648 --> 07:27.647
When I first started flying,
I used to crash all the time.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.647
Only got a handle on it after
I got my pilot's license.

07:31.648 --> 07:34.648
Just because you can,
doesn't mean you know how.

07:39.648 --> 07:41.648
He came at an angle.

07:44.525 --> 07:45.648
From there.

07:57.648 --> 07:58.647
Anything?

07:58.648 --> 08:01.647
I'm wondering where
Calista might be going next.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.648
What other fucked up shit
she might try to get powers.

08:08.648 --> 08:10.647
Is this a hangout for the Powerz Kidz?

08:10.648 --> 08:14.525
No. No, it's not central enough for them.

08:14.648 --> 08:16.983
So they probably wouldn't make a habit

08:17.108 --> 08:19.648
of coming up here to party, get high.

08:39.648 --> 08:40.647
I'll come back later.

08:40.648 --> 08:41.648
It's okay.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.648
I know you don't think
about girls that way.

08:47.648 --> 08:49.648
I mean, you and Simons are a thing. Right?

08:51.248 --> 08:54.648
Simons' sexuality defies categorization.

09:01.648 --> 09:03.150
I'm not that modest.

09:04.648 --> 09:07.648
Modesty is an unappreciated
virtue these days.

09:08.648 --> 09:09.648
Okay.

09:12.648 --> 09:15.648
Unexpected beauty is a nearly sacred thing.

09:17.648 --> 09:20.648
A revelation changes you
by the act of noticing it.

09:23.233 --> 09:26.647
Hold something of yourself in reserve.

09:26.648 --> 09:28.648
The promise of revelation.

09:35.024 --> 09:37.648
Do you think the cops
are still looking for me?

09:40.191 --> 09:41.648
You going somewhere?

09:43.316 --> 09:44.648
Do I need permission?

09:46.774 --> 09:48.608
You can go wherever you want.

09:48.648 --> 09:51.648
But, yes, the police are
still looking for you.

09:54.525 --> 09:56.816
You have no idea what it
feels like to be trapped.

09:59.648 --> 10:02.648
How do you think I discovered my power?

10:05.567 --> 10:06.732
I spent a long time

10:06.858 --> 10:10.316
wishing I could get away
from what my life was like.

10:11.648 --> 10:12.648
And then...

10:16.648 --> 10:20.647
You made your escape from the
police, you even eluded Retro Girl.

10:20.648 --> 10:23.647
But still I wonder...

10:23.648 --> 10:24.648
What?

10:25.648 --> 10:27.648
I keep thinking of you, hiding,

10:28.648 --> 10:31.647
listening to Retro Girl
as she betrayed you.

10:31.648 --> 10:34.400
But you still admire her, don't you?

10:38.648 --> 10:40.648
She's still Retro Girl.

10:41.648 --> 10:44.648
No, she's not.

10:45.588 --> 10:47.839
Retro Girl is not a person.

10:47.964 --> 10:51.588
She is the overexposed image
that's been sold to you.

10:53.588 --> 10:55.588
She's a lie, Calista.

10:57.588 --> 10:59.587
And until you free yourself from that trap,

10:59.588 --> 11:01.173
she will keep on hurting you.

11:02.588 --> 11:05.215
Retro Girl is lonely and vulgar,

11:05.340 --> 11:07.048
but she is vastly powerful.

11:08.588 --> 11:10.923
And you are not the
only one who'll get hurt.

11:26.423 --> 11:27.587
Who would have known Zora

11:27.588 --> 11:29.298
would have been juiced up like this?

11:29.423 --> 11:31.587
PAR? What is she, like, 20?

11:31.588 --> 11:35.173
Well, she must have something
real or they wouldn't bother.

11:46.090 --> 11:47.587
So, back when this guy

11:47.588 --> 11:49.587
was the keynote at our annual retreat,

11:49.588 --> 11:52.548
and Richard made it my job to make
sure that he got there on time.

11:52.588 --> 11:55.006
So I finally tracked him
down at the Hotel La Chapelle,

11:55.131 --> 11:58.588
where he was shacked up with
some very famous actress,

11:58.588 --> 12:00.298
and he's hammered.

12:00.423 --> 12:01.587
- You remember this?
- Yeah.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.587
So I get him in the
costume and into the limo.

12:03.588 --> 12:05.881
We pull in to the Four Seasons,
paparazzi is everywhere,

12:06.048 --> 12:08.587
he pulls down the mask, looks at me and

12:08.588 --> 12:09.588
pukes all over me.

12:09.589 --> 12:11.588
And you know what he says? "Sorry, dude.

12:11.588 --> 12:14.588
It was either you or them,
and you don't have a camera."

12:16.588 --> 12:18.964
- That was a long time ago.
- Times change.

12:19.090 --> 12:21.588
I mean, here I am. There you are.

12:23.588 --> 12:25.588
And here these are.

12:27.588 --> 12:29.587
What the fuck?

12:29.588 --> 12:31.588
Yeah, looks like your agent
doesn't recognize your dead friend.

12:31.588 --> 12:34.587
Okay. See, when my
client tells me some cops

12:34.588 --> 12:35.586
are harassing her on the street...

12:35.587 --> 12:37.423
We're just trying to
figure out what happened.

12:37.588 --> 12:38.588
... and then sans counsel,

12:38.588 --> 12:40.048
you make her show you some
fucking after hours club...

12:40.173 --> 12:41.587
It's a murder investigation.

12:41.588 --> 12:42.587
Don't say a fucking word to them.

12:42.588 --> 12:44.588
Hey, we have a dead kid.
She saw him two nights ago.

12:44.589 --> 12:46.587
And you dump this shit on my table?

12:46.588 --> 12:49.587
You used to be an asshole that could
fly, now you're just an asshole.

12:49.588 --> 12:50.587
She's a star.

12:50.588 --> 12:52.587
She's a fucking hero, and I won't...

12:52.588 --> 12:55.588
Don't talk like I'm not here!

13:04.588 --> 13:05.587
Look at me,

13:05.588 --> 13:07.587
but don't see just me.

13:07.588 --> 13:09.587
See the whole room.

13:09.588 --> 13:11.587
Extend your peripheral vision.

13:11.588 --> 13:13.588
You are in control.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.588
Okay?

13:39.588 --> 13:40.588
We weren't a thing.

13:40.589 --> 13:44.756
We made out a few times,
but I really don't know him.

13:44.881 --> 13:47.048
See? She doesn't know...

13:47.173 --> 13:50.588
The Wannabe, Calista, whatever
happened between the two of you,

13:50.588 --> 13:53.465
she ended the night by
jumping off a building.

13:55.798 --> 13:57.587
- Is she...
- She's alive.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.587
But she's still missing.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.588
We don't want her to end up like this.

14:23.265 --> 14:24.587
Chubb182.

14:25.173 --> 14:26.587
I think Zora is tired.

14:26.588 --> 14:28.923
Just look it up.

14:30.351 --> 14:31.964
Chubb182.

14:32.588 --> 14:34.090
Thank you.

14:36.588 --> 14:39.588
The flowers.

14:40.232 --> 14:41.839
When did this start?

14:41.906 --> 14:42.957
When the cops came.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.689
After this last awake and aware period,

14:44.714 --> 14:46.946
I pulled out the orbitoclast,
and he said the same thing.

14:46.947 --> 14:49.588
- Is something wrong?
- The cellular regeneration

14:49.588 --> 14:51.588
is the basis of his speed,
strength and toughness.

14:52.631 --> 14:54.587
Even his ability to consume

14:54.588 --> 14:57.173
and absorb biokinetic energy.

14:58.588 --> 15:00.048
We can't turn his powers off.

15:00.215 --> 15:02.340
We can only retard them.

15:05.215 --> 15:06.588
Christian?

15:06.672 --> 15:08.507
Johnny?

15:10.588 --> 15:12.548
By severing his self-awareness.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.588
Is he still in there?

15:24.588 --> 15:25.588
Something is in there.

15:25.588 --> 15:27.881
The power is certainly still in there.

15:28.048 --> 15:29.731
You know, I read his book in high school.

15:29.756 --> 15:31.588
We all read his book.

15:32.588 --> 15:34.588
His book was bullshit.

15:36.672 --> 15:38.587
Let me know if he says anything new

15:38.588 --> 15:39.964
at the next awake and aware period.

15:43.964 --> 15:46.588
I thought it was a good book.

16:47.588 --> 16:49.587
Tell her I'm not a criminal.

16:49.588 --> 16:51.381
Are you not a criminal?

16:51.507 --> 16:53.131
You ran from the police.

16:53.256 --> 16:54.587
You said that I could trust you,

16:54.588 --> 16:56.423
and then you sold me out to the cops.

16:57.588 --> 16:59.587
No. I never said that.

16:59.588 --> 17:01.587
I never promised you anything.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.588
I brought you into my
home and you lied to me.

17:03.588 --> 17:06.288
And I don't have time for
this. Call Powers Division.

17:06.309 --> 17:07.686
Royalle said that you're dangerous.

17:07.731 --> 17:10.688
That you're gonna hurt
me and everyone around me.

17:19.307 --> 17:20.964
So, tell me about Royalle.

17:21.011 --> 17:22.671
He's trying to build something.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.484
So what does he want from you?

17:24.486 --> 17:25.588
Why are you with him?

17:26.866 --> 17:28.587
I want powers.

17:29.295 --> 17:32.587
I mean, I have powers, I just haven't...

17:34.231 --> 17:37.207
No one takes me seriously.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.588
That's why I jumped off the building.

17:40.342 --> 17:41.588
Diamond...

17:43.143 --> 17:46.588
Walker said that that's
how he found his powers.

17:47.188 --> 17:49.587
You would have died.

17:49.588 --> 17:52.088
Do you understand that if I hadn't
been there, you would have died?

17:52.109 --> 17:53.838
But you've always saved me.

17:59.256 --> 18:00.588
Not you, um...

18:02.588 --> 18:03.588
My mom.

18:04.714 --> 18:07.131
My dad would lose his shit,

18:08.588 --> 18:09.589
over anything.

18:11.588 --> 18:13.587
You never knew what would set him off,

18:13.588 --> 18:15.588
but you knew what was coming.

18:16.631 --> 18:19.088
And my mom would flash
this Retro Girl tattoo

18:19.114 --> 18:20.592
that she had on the back of her hand.

18:20.688 --> 18:23.688
It was like a promise that
she would keep me safe.

18:24.588 --> 18:25.964
And she did.

18:26.588 --> 18:28.587
She would stand between me and him,

18:28.588 --> 18:31.588
and she would take as
many punches as she could.

18:31.588 --> 18:34.588
She pretended to be you
to make herself strong.

18:36.588 --> 18:38.588
I know it's crazy,

18:40.588 --> 18:43.588
but I knew that you
would save me if I jumped.

18:49.588 --> 18:50.588
The fall killed him.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.588
Also, he has red corkscrews in his DNA.

18:54.798 --> 18:56.090
This stuff again?

18:56.215 --> 18:57.588
Olympia with the exploding heart,

18:57.672 --> 19:01.587
the headless Power with the impossible
wound, and the flier who can't fly.

19:01.588 --> 19:04.588
All appear to have been taking the same,

19:04.588 --> 19:07.964
well, let's call it a drug
until we know otherwise.

19:08.131 --> 19:10.551
- What does it do?
- I have no idea what it does.

19:10.588 --> 19:12.588
We have three dead Powers.

19:12.588 --> 19:14.588
If Wannabes decide to try it,

19:14.589 --> 19:16.589
my guess is they'll die instantly.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.587
Great.

19:18.588 --> 19:20.588
- How soon until we can identify...
- Probably never.

19:20.881 --> 19:22.588
I'll do what I can.

19:23.756 --> 19:25.587
Thank you, Doc.

19:25.588 --> 19:26.587
Mmm-hmm.

19:26.588 --> 19:30.090
Hey, it's me, Kaotic Chic, again.

19:30.215 --> 19:32.587
You sure you don't think this is weird?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.587
I'm not stalking you or anything.

19:34.588 --> 19:35.588
It's all good.

19:36.588 --> 19:37.588
Can I ask you something?

19:38.288 --> 19:39.487
Sure.

19:39.488 --> 19:40.587
Why do you play the game?

19:40.588 --> 19:41.839
I like hurting them.

19:41.964 --> 19:44.548
It makes me feel in control.

19:45.588 --> 19:47.587
Like I'm not weak.

19:47.588 --> 19:48.588
I know that's fucked up.

19:48.589 --> 19:50.587
It's not.

19:50.588 --> 19:53.587
My cousin died when some
asshole wrecked a building

19:53.588 --> 19:56.587
fighting another asshole
who was trying to blow it up.

19:56.588 --> 19:58.631
Makes perfect sense, right?

19:58.798 --> 20:02.587
One got away and one got a movie deal.

20:02.588 --> 20:05.587
No one had to answer for any of it.

20:05.588 --> 20:10.588
No one even knows what it
meant to my family or to me.

20:13.588 --> 20:14.588
Somebody should.

20:15.588 --> 20:17.587
Someone should make a statement.

20:17.588 --> 20:18.587
A statement?

20:18.588 --> 20:21.587
That's cool. I know a place.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.006
Wolfe is beginning to remember things.

20:24.173 --> 20:26.588
- What does it mean?
- Nothing, I think.

20:26.588 --> 20:28.948
His brain has to heal daily,
forming new connections.

20:28.982 --> 20:30.488
I don't know that his actual thoughts,

20:30.529 --> 20:32.307
his memories even exist any longer.

20:33.465 --> 20:34.588
When's the next test?

20:34.589 --> 20:35.587
When I'm ready.

20:35.588 --> 20:37.588
When I feel confident I
won't kill anyone else.

20:38.588 --> 20:40.587
We need to get this done.

20:40.588 --> 20:41.588
So let me work.

20:51.131 --> 20:53.589
I gave something to Olympia
when I hooked up with him.

20:53.714 --> 20:55.587
This stuff, Sway.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.587
It's like a powers booster.

20:57.588 --> 21:00.587
Johnny Royalle is using
you to pimp out drugs.

21:00.588 --> 21:01.587
It's not like that.

21:01.588 --> 21:03.340
Oh, it's exactly like that.

21:03.465 --> 21:06.340
It wasn't even him. It was this guy, Bug.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.587
Johnny was really mad when he found out.

21:08.588 --> 21:11.587
Don't make excuses for him.

21:11.588 --> 21:14.587
You're being used. He is exploiting you.

21:14.588 --> 21:18.090
He is offering you
something he cannot give you.

21:18.256 --> 21:20.588
You don't need powers
in order to be powerful.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.548
Right.

21:25.714 --> 21:27.587
Come, let me show you something.

21:27.588 --> 21:30.588
You're not gonna call the police?

21:32.298 --> 21:34.588
No, you're under my protection now.

21:36.588 --> 21:39.587
But let me show you how power really works.

21:39.588 --> 21:42.588
First, you have to look the part. Come on.

21:46.381 --> 21:49.381
Golden got something on
that Chubb182 username.

21:49.507 --> 21:50.587
Guy's name is Larry Gerald.

21:50.588 --> 21:53.587
It's linked to a Show
Us Your Powers account.

21:53.588 --> 21:55.256
Posted a new video.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.714
Levitation Boy taking off.

21:57.589 --> 21:59.588
Catch me if you can.

22:07.588 --> 22:10.465
He was priming his powers.

22:10.588 --> 22:12.587
"Priming his powers"?

22:12.588 --> 22:14.587
All he could do was hover, nothing badass.

22:14.588 --> 22:17.672
Why do you think he was hanging
out with a Wannabe like me?

22:17.798 --> 22:20.588
Kidz with legit power think
the rest of us are losers.

22:22.588 --> 22:23.588
How did he do it, Larry?

22:25.588 --> 22:26.588
Sway.

22:28.588 --> 22:29.587
Shit cranks the limits.

22:29.588 --> 22:31.258
It's a total boost.

22:31.274 --> 22:33.131
He thought he could do
some trick night flying,

22:33.298 --> 22:34.587
maybe get his video to go viral,

22:34.588 --> 22:36.587
but guess he needed to take more.

22:36.588 --> 22:38.588
That's an unregulated powers enhancer.

22:39.298 --> 22:41.587
Who'd he get it from?

22:41.588 --> 22:44.588
You don't tell me, I'm
going to assume it was you.

22:49.149 --> 22:50.587
I'm going to ask you again.

22:51.588 --> 22:53.215
Who did he get it from?

22:54.588 --> 22:55.964
The new place. Here and Gone.

22:57.588 --> 22:58.964
Johnny Royalle?

22:59.131 --> 23:00.587
I don't think so.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.548
I don't know. Shit.

23:04.588 --> 23:05.588
Where's the rest of it?

23:09.423 --> 23:12.587
Thought that maybe it could, uh,

23:12.588 --> 23:16.048
give me some powers, but then
he fell. I didn't have the balls.

23:17.588 --> 23:18.756
At least you're alive.

23:25.340 --> 23:26.588
Sway.

23:29.588 --> 23:31.588
You know, the kid was holding.

23:32.588 --> 23:33.587
He's a kid.

23:33.588 --> 23:36.588
You wanna ruin his life for being stupid?

23:38.588 --> 23:42.587
If Royalle is selling powers enhancers,

23:42.588 --> 23:44.587
dropping him down the Shaft gets easy.

23:44.588 --> 23:47.587
Have to make sure you do it the right way.

23:47.588 --> 23:50.587
Probably have to go to
his club, see it happen.

23:50.588 --> 23:52.587
But not too close.

23:52.588 --> 23:55.588
Just observational, for fuck's sake.

23:57.588 --> 23:59.588
Observational. Fuck yeah.

24:05.588 --> 24:08.587
What happens if I kill you?

24:08.588 --> 24:09.587
Nothing.

24:09.588 --> 24:11.588
The deal is the same.

24:12.588 --> 24:15.587
You attack me, the test commences,

24:15.588 --> 24:17.588
and clemency is yours.

24:19.756 --> 24:22.298
They shorted one of my eyes.

24:22.588 --> 24:24.587
That's okay.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.588
Just saying I'm not at my best.

24:29.588 --> 24:31.672
Okay.

24:31.798 --> 24:34.588
You can't ride the lightning!

24:47.588 --> 24:49.588
I can't... I feel...

24:50.006 --> 24:51.588
What do you feel?

24:53.588 --> 24:55.588
I can't feel myself.

25:20.589 --> 25:22.588
- Really?
- Yeah!

25:22.588 --> 25:23.587
It's funny.

25:23.588 --> 25:25.448
Can't believe you did an
episode of Baywatch.

25:25.947 --> 25:27.881
Yeah. Shouldn't you be looking out there?

25:32.588 --> 25:34.587
I thought Righteous
Thunder never left New York.

25:34.588 --> 25:36.923
Hawking his new energy
drink would be my guess.

25:42.588 --> 25:45.587
Did you ever have your own energy drink?

25:45.588 --> 25:47.587
- They weren't a thing in my day.
- Oh.

25:47.588 --> 25:48.588
Sneakers?

25:50.423 --> 25:52.587
Black Diamonds.

25:52.588 --> 25:55.588
It's in the book. Around page 76, I think.

25:56.298 --> 25:57.587
- You think.
- Yeah.

25:57.588 --> 26:00.298
Ooh, can I get a pair? The
'90s are totally coming back.

26:05.588 --> 26:06.923
Why are we here?

26:07.048 --> 26:09.588
I told you, I'm going to show
you how power really works.

26:09.672 --> 26:11.588
Try not to squint.

26:21.588 --> 26:22.588
Motherfucker.

26:27.589 --> 26:29.587
She fucking lied to us.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.588
Calista's been with her the whole time.

26:31.588 --> 26:33.587
If we go in there, we are the lead
story in the Powers That Be.

26:33.588 --> 26:36.588
And Royalle's lawyers rain down
shit on the entire division, so...

26:36.589 --> 26:39.587
- Listen to me. We can go in there, okay?
- Uh-uh.

26:39.588 --> 26:41.340
She is like fucking gravity.

26:41.465 --> 26:42.587
When she goes into a room,

26:42.588 --> 26:44.588
everybody is paying attention to her.

26:46.381 --> 26:47.587
Okay. Okay.

26:47.588 --> 26:50.256
We have to be some
di-fucking-screet motherfuckers.

26:50.381 --> 26:52.587
Okay? No distractions
with your personal shit,

26:52.588 --> 26:54.988
with, like, your former
ex and your bestie. Okay?

26:56.023 --> 26:57.587
Di-fucking-screet. Yeah.

26:57.588 --> 26:58.587
Okay.

26:58.588 --> 26:59.881
Let's go.

27:10.508 --> 27:12.507
Welcome to Here and Gone.

27:12.508 --> 27:14.508
We're honored to have you.

27:42.676 --> 27:44.508
Shit.

27:47.508 --> 27:48.508
God damn it!

27:50.508 --> 27:52.507
I thought you said di-fucking-screet.

27:52.508 --> 27:54.718
I thought you wanted the fuck inside.

28:22.508 --> 28:25.592
Powers or a face, people,
that's how you get inside.

28:29.759 --> 28:30.759
Hey, schoolboy!

28:33.468 --> 28:35.508
Yeah, you got something. Come on.

28:39.508 --> 28:41.508
Watch your back. This way.

28:58.135 --> 28:59.508
She brought Retro Girl.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.508
Create some space for
a private chat, please.

29:16.508 --> 29:17.507
Excuse us.

29:17.508 --> 29:19.507
- Hey, Ma'am. Please go back.
- Retro Girl.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.508
Retro... Retro Girl, I love you!

29:21.551 --> 29:23.507
I love you!

29:23.508 --> 29:24.508
Excuse us.

29:25.508 --> 29:27.508
A little space. A little
more space, please.

29:27.551 --> 29:29.385
Excuse us. Thank you.

29:34.508 --> 29:36.507
Okay.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.508
Do you see her?

29:41.051 --> 29:42.508
Got her.

29:43.508 --> 29:44.508
Or not.

29:45.926 --> 29:46.926
How's it going, man?

29:49.508 --> 29:50.508
All right, dude.

29:53.508 --> 29:54.508
Thanks, baby.

29:59.508 --> 30:01.507
The Kidz are taking Sway.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.508
Mmm.

30:02.592 --> 30:06.010
And the bald creep, creeps, whatever,

30:06.135 --> 30:07.592
they're doing the passes.

30:07.718 --> 30:10.508
Royalle's dealing in his own club.

30:23.508 --> 30:25.507
You're trying to make me jealous?

30:25.508 --> 30:27.508
- I was just about to come find you.
- To tell me what?

30:27.508 --> 30:29.508
That you brought Retro Girl to my home?

30:30.843 --> 30:33.509
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything.

30:33.510 --> 30:35.508
What does she want here?

30:35.508 --> 30:38.407
She wants to protect me. She
wants to show me something.

30:38.408 --> 30:39.648
What does she want to show you?

30:40.592 --> 30:42.508
She wants to show me how real power works.

30:44.508 --> 30:47.508
You kept talking about
how she's so dangerous.

30:47.508 --> 30:50.508
But I'm close to her now. She
won't do anything to hurt me.

30:51.279 --> 30:53.108
And I can protect you,

30:53.155 --> 30:55.818
make sure she leaves you alone.

30:55.851 --> 30:58.801
And if you tell me what you're
doing, I could, you know, help you.

31:01.814 --> 31:03.382
Please don't be mad at me.

31:05.676 --> 31:08.508
I'm not mad at you.
I'll never be mad at you.

31:08.509 --> 31:10.507
But it's time to go to the safe place.

31:10.508 --> 31:11.843
But...

31:12.010 --> 31:14.508
Go to the safe place, Annabel.

31:23.508 --> 31:25.507
We can figure out just cause later.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.801
There's a stash here somewhere.

31:27.926 --> 31:30.676
Unregulated power enhancer,
that's a massive bust.

31:30.801 --> 31:33.507
He's not dealing. He's giving it to them.

31:33.508 --> 31:35.508
There's no money changing hands.

31:35.508 --> 31:38.508
Righteous Thunder, Queen Noir,
none of the big Powers are on Sway.

31:38.509 --> 31:41.135
He's giving it to the Kidz. Fuck.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.507
We need to get Calista. Now.

31:44.508 --> 31:45.592
Yeah.

31:45.718 --> 31:47.088
I'll circle around the top.

31:47.103 --> 31:48.507
All right. Back door in five.

31:48.508 --> 31:49.508
See you then.

32:05.508 --> 32:06.508
Hey.

32:23.508 --> 32:24.508
See ya.

33:10.508 --> 33:14.508
Other people wanna take a
shit and do blow, douchewad.

33:18.508 --> 33:19.508
What the...

33:21.508 --> 33:23.843
This is some uncivilized shit, man.

33:38.508 --> 33:40.507
Calista!

33:40.508 --> 33:42.507
No, no, no, no. Time to go now.

33:42.508 --> 33:43.507
Get off me!

33:43.508 --> 33:45.789
Hold up, hold up, hold up.
What the fuck is going on here?

33:45.801 --> 33:48.507
This... this is what's going on.

33:48.508 --> 33:50.507
That supposed to mean something to me?

33:50.508 --> 33:51.843
It would if you could read.

33:51.968 --> 33:54.338
You know how many lives I've
saved? How many cops I've saved?

33:54.338 --> 33:55.508
Don't flash that crackerjack shit at me.

33:55.508 --> 33:57.508
It's a party, so ease up on the kid.

33:57.509 --> 33:59.508
I got some crackerjack shit for you.

34:08.301 --> 34:09.507
Edwin.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.507
Patty.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.217
Christian-motherfucking-Walker.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.507
I ain't seen you in a minute.

34:16.507 --> 34:17.507
You all right?

34:17.507 --> 34:18.507
Peachy.

34:18.507 --> 34:20.507
- She with you?
- Yeah.

34:21.507 --> 34:22.967
Teach your partner some manners.

34:23.092 --> 34:24.260
Fuck you.

34:24.551 --> 34:26.507
Let it go.

34:26.507 --> 34:28.507
We need to ask her some questions.

34:28.507 --> 34:30.507
Fuck that cop shit, brother.

34:30.507 --> 34:33.507
The kid was with Philip
when he died, Edwin.

34:33.507 --> 34:35.507
Sad days, man.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.592
Olympia dying in bed. I
ain't going out like that.

34:39.427 --> 34:41.507
There are worse ways to go.

34:43.176 --> 34:45.507
Ain't the same up there without you, bro.

34:45.507 --> 34:47.217
Ain't the same since you fell.

34:47.342 --> 34:48.342
Appreciate it.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.507
We have to go out the front.

34:57.551 --> 35:00.260
How are you still alive?

35:00.385 --> 35:03.508
I ran away before Wolfe could kill me.

35:04.508 --> 35:07.508
Much as that seems to
have disappointed humanity.

35:13.508 --> 35:16.508
No, I mean, how are you
still living with yourself?

35:17.759 --> 35:21.051
How have you not killed yourself yet?

35:21.218 --> 35:23.508
If I'm such a figure of repulsion,

35:24.508 --> 35:26.507
why are you here?

35:26.508 --> 35:29.508
Did you come here to, what, beat me up?

35:29.551 --> 35:33.507
Well, in just the few
moments that I've been here,

35:33.508 --> 35:35.507
that's enough for the
Twitter-verse to explode.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.507
"Retro Girl visits Johnny
Royalle's nightclub."

35:38.508 --> 35:40.507
And the minute I walk out that door,

35:40.508 --> 35:42.507
the world will be quivering

35:42.508 --> 35:44.507
in anticipation of what I'll say.

35:44.508 --> 35:49.507
And when I tell them,
"Yes, it's a fine place

35:49.508 --> 35:53.343
to bring your mom and dad and
do some B-list Power watching,"

35:53.468 --> 35:55.926
you'll be out of business in a week.

35:56.051 --> 35:58.507
And when that week is over

35:58.508 --> 36:01.508
and nobody's watching you,
cares about what you do,

36:03.260 --> 36:04.551
I may come back to beat you up.

36:13.508 --> 36:14.507
You're hurting me.

36:14.508 --> 36:17.507
- We dodged the bald guy?
- Yeah.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.010
Well, don't worry about them.

36:21.508 --> 36:24.508
Christian. Detective.

36:25.508 --> 36:27.507
I'm so glad you could come.

36:27.508 --> 36:30.507
Simons informs me someone's
broken in through a back door.

36:30.508 --> 36:33.507
Are you here to investigate
this illegal entry?

36:33.508 --> 36:34.507
Don't get close to him.

36:34.508 --> 36:36.507
Because, I mean, what other reason

36:36.508 --> 36:39.507
would you have for entering
a licensed establishment

36:39.508 --> 36:41.507
run by a registered Power

36:41.508 --> 36:45.508
who has a restraining order against
the entire fucking Powers Division?

36:49.508 --> 36:52.507
Calista, come here.

36:52.508 --> 36:55.468
Calista, on the roof...

36:55.508 --> 36:56.634
They can't touch you.

36:57.508 --> 37:00.507
On the roof, I was wrong.

37:00.508 --> 37:01.801
You're not like everybody else.

37:01.926 --> 37:03.507
You proved that when you jumped.

37:03.508 --> 37:04.507
They can't take you away.

37:04.508 --> 37:07.507
There's something inside
of you that won't give up,

37:07.508 --> 37:08.551
won't give in.

37:08.676 --> 37:10.508
Come with us.

37:11.551 --> 37:13.507
Calista,

37:13.508 --> 37:14.508
it's time to go.

37:14.551 --> 37:16.508
It's under control, Janice.

37:16.508 --> 37:20.135
Yes, it is because she's coming with me.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.508
I'll go with you. I love you.

37:26.509 --> 37:29.176
Stop touching me and grabbing me!

37:46.508 --> 37:49.508
You do what you have to do.

37:49.508 --> 37:50.508
But you're on your own.

37:54.294 --> 37:55.592
Fuck this. You're coming with us.

37:55.718 --> 37:57.507
- We are the police, okay?
- Calista.

37:57.508 --> 37:58.507
Enough of this.

37:58.508 --> 38:00.508
They can't take you away from your home.

38:22.260 --> 38:23.508
I'm sorry.

38:25.508 --> 38:27.508
It wasn't safe back there.

38:28.884 --> 38:30.508
Where are we?

38:34.508 --> 38:36.508
Where are we?

38:42.343 --> 38:43.926
I'll tell you a story.

38:44.093 --> 38:47.508
You never know, she could've
been picked up by a pervert.

38:47.508 --> 38:50.508
Oh, yeah, you know
everything. You always do.

38:51.508 --> 38:53.718
I told her Becca's mom
couldn't bring me home.

38:53.843 --> 38:57.173
- I kept waiting for her, but...
- Where do you want to go?

38:57.196 --> 38:58.508
Come on. Where should we go?

38:59.508 --> 39:01.507
There is no place.

39:01.508 --> 39:02.748
I was reading about Bear Island

39:02.884 --> 39:04.507
in the Barents Sea, off Norway.

39:04.508 --> 39:06.507
The beaches have snow instead of sand.

39:06.508 --> 39:07.507
It'd be cold.

39:07.508 --> 39:09.507
Oh, God damn it. Screw you!

39:09.508 --> 39:11.507
Bear Island is one of the
cleanest places on Earth.

39:11.508 --> 39:13.468
Hardly anyone lives there.

39:14.508 --> 39:16.468
They don't even have phones there.

39:16.508 --> 39:17.801
No one could find us.

39:17.926 --> 39:19.508
That's where we should go.

39:19.509 --> 39:21.508
Annabel, get out here!

39:24.508 --> 39:26.508
We're gonna go away from here, Bel.

39:26.508 --> 39:29.135
- Close your eyes. We're not here.
- I don't want to go away.

39:29.260 --> 39:31.407
I just don't want him to hurt me anymore.

39:31.408 --> 39:32.508
We're gonna go to Bear Island

39:32.509 --> 39:34.884
and we're gonna make
snow angels on the beach.

39:35.010 --> 39:36.507
And we're gonna go away.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.507
- If you were here...
- What are you doing in here?

39:38.508 --> 39:40.508
Huh? Come here! You can't hide from me!

39:40.508 --> 39:41.508
Make it stop. Make it stop.

39:41.509 --> 39:43.301
- Leave her alone!
- Get out of my way!

39:43.468 --> 39:44.507
Make it stop. Make it stop.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.507
Make it stop. Make it stop.

39:46.508 --> 39:47.588
Make it stop. Make it stop.

39:51.801 --> 39:53.508
Annabel?

40:08.508 --> 40:11.508
You came back for her, right?

40:12.508 --> 40:14.507
I was 15.

40:14.508 --> 40:16.508
I don't know, but this deserted island,

40:18.508 --> 40:22.507
the night lasts all winter,
the winters are long.

40:22.508 --> 40:24.507
I didn't even understand how I got there.

40:24.508 --> 40:27.508
I mean, I knew I must be a Power,

40:29.093 --> 40:31.508
but I didn't know how it worked.

40:35.508 --> 40:38.508
I tried, I tried to get back.

40:41.508 --> 40:43.759
But I couldn't, not for years.

40:48.759 --> 40:51.176
It was too late.

40:51.343 --> 40:53.508
Is it something that you can fix?

41:03.843 --> 41:05.508
Let's go home, Calista.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.507
I had her.

41:08.508 --> 41:10.507
- I fucking had her.
- I know.

41:10.508 --> 41:12.135
And I was doing everything right in there

41:12.260 --> 41:13.506
and then I had to go and lose my shit.

41:13.507 --> 41:15.427
You were good in there.
You're a good detective

41:15.508 --> 41:16.508
and a good partner.

41:23.508 --> 41:24.926
I need you to hide.

41:25.051 --> 41:26.506
Wait. What? No. You can't leave me here.

41:26.507 --> 41:27.507
Simons will come get you.

41:27.508 --> 41:29.051
They won't think to look for you here.

41:29.218 --> 41:30.507
You have to trust me.

41:30.508 --> 41:31.509
I don't understand.

41:31.676 --> 41:33.508
There's something I gotta do.

41:34.508 --> 41:35.676
Just hide.

41:35.801 --> 41:37.508
- Johnny, don't leave me!
- I'll be back.

41:47.508 --> 41:48.508
Hey.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.508
Uh, hey.

41:51.508 --> 41:53.508
Uh, you know how to get out of here?

41:54.634 --> 41:57.051
Yeah, I do.

42:11.676 --> 42:13.551
Thirty-six seconds late.

42:14.551 --> 42:17.508
I left her out back. Go get her.

42:51.866 --> 42:53.960
Can I go home, Johnny?

42:58.508 --> 43:00.508
I want to go home now.

43:05.082 --> 43:10.647
