00:12.830 --> 00:16.265
Stinky, disgusting, filthy.

00:16.332 --> 00:19.635
Bon appÃ©tit!
Ugh!

00:19.703 --> 00:22.104
Can't wait till the automated
feeder arrives.

00:22.172 --> 00:23.806
That makes two of us, sister.

00:23.873 --> 00:26.676
Poor Alice doesn't get much
satisfaction from her work.

00:26.743 --> 00:29.312
Let's not empathize with the
zookeeper, Private.

00:29.379 --> 00:30.746
It dulls your edge.

00:30.814 --> 00:32.613
(Rumbling)

00:32.682 --> 00:34.882
(Screaming)

00:34.950 --> 00:36.618
Kowalski, are you okay?

00:36.686 --> 00:37.619
(Coughing)

00:37.687 --> 00:39.621
Yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

00:39.689 --> 00:42.089
But my cold-fusion beverage
chiller is about to obliterate

00:42.157 --> 00:45.694
every living creature within a
5-mile radius.

00:45.761 --> 00:48.796
Splendid, another one of your
inventions endangers us all.

00:48.863 --> 00:51.898
Rico, terminate Kowalski's
latest disaster.

00:53.267 --> 00:56.570
If only I could boost my
brainpower from super-genius to

00:56.638 --> 00:58.171
super-mega-genius.

00:58.239 --> 00:59.206
(Explosion)

00:59.273 --> 01:01.775
Gosh, Kowalski, I think your
brainpower's already tiptop.

01:01.843 --> 01:03.777
You also think there's a
little man in the fridge who

01:03.845 --> 01:04.777
turns the light on and off.

01:04.845 --> 01:06.212
And one day I'll catch him.

01:06.279 --> 01:09.549
No, my brain must be better.
And it will be!

01:09.616 --> 01:12.184
I will be the--

01:12.252 --> 01:13.185
Ow!

01:13.253 --> 01:14.620
Not off to a great start.

01:14.688 --> 01:19.692
(dramatic music)

01:27.600 --> 01:29.601
(Cackling)

01:32.405 --> 01:37.107
I did it!
I have supercharged my brain!

01:37.175 --> 01:39.510
Hey, new noggin?
Good on you.

01:39.578 --> 01:41.245
It's quite... bulbous.

01:41.312 --> 01:43.414
Isn't it?
All I had to do was irradiate

01:43.482 --> 01:48.619
massive quantities of omega-3
fatty acids then add--

01:48.687 --> 01:49.620
(Scoffing)

01:49.688 --> 01:53.623
Why am I even bothering?
All you tiny-brained folk need

01:53.691 --> 01:57.427
to know is, I am now the
smartest penguin on Earth!

01:57.495 --> 01:59.363
Weren't you already that?

01:59.430 --> 02:03.934
Well, yeah.
But I am way smarter now!

02:04.002 --> 02:07.104
I can do anything!
Cure the common cold, solve

02:07.171 --> 02:10.205
string theory, calculate Pi to
the millionth digit.

02:10.274 --> 02:11.807
Yay, pie!

02:11.875 --> 02:14.676
Well, if anybody needs me,
I'll be pushing the envelope of

02:14.744 --> 02:15.677
fluid structural dynamics and

02:15.745 --> 02:19.215
mode-coupled regenerative
machines.

02:19.283 --> 02:20.716
Pie?

02:20.784 --> 02:22.718
Sorry, Rico.
No pie.

02:22.786 --> 02:23.786
But it is almost lunchtime.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.320
Yay!

02:25.388 --> 02:27.389
What is the chow hold-up?

02:27.456 --> 02:28.390
Fish!

02:28.457 --> 02:31.226
I'm a bit peckish, Skipper.
Where is Alice?

02:31.294 --> 02:34.161
"The automated animal feed
distribution system takes the

02:34.229 --> 02:35.963
hassle and mess out of--"

02:36.031 --> 02:39.133
Blah, blah, blah.
Let's just fire this baby up.

02:43.071 --> 02:45.339
Oh!

02:45.407 --> 02:47.374
Huh?

02:48.676 --> 02:52.145
Look, Maurice, the sky
spirits are giving to us a

02:52.212 --> 02:54.013
fruiteous bounty!

02:54.081 --> 02:56.082
Huh?

02:56.150 --> 02:59.252
I got it, I got it!

02:59.320 --> 03:00.420
Yes!

03:00.488 --> 03:03.722
I'll never have to schlep food
to these lazy animals again.

03:06.259 --> 03:10.128
Ooh, looks like Alice got
herself some heavy artillery.

03:10.196 --> 03:12.665
Nice.

03:12.732 --> 03:14.333
That's not all, is it?

03:14.400 --> 03:19.204
She can't expect us to share
just one fish.

03:19.272 --> 03:21.706
Did you miss the word "share"?

03:21.774 --> 03:23.708
Ahh!

03:23.776 --> 03:25.242
Kowalski.

03:25.310 --> 03:26.644
I thought your big new noggin

03:26.712 --> 03:29.547
was gonna prevent these kind of
shenanigans.

03:29.615 --> 03:31.883
Did your cold-fusion beverage
chiller go wrong again?

03:31.951 --> 03:34.519
No, it worked perfectly,
along with the nuclear-powered

03:34.587 --> 03:36.052
bagel toaster, the positronic

03:36.120 --> 03:38.589
tongue cleaner and the subatomic
nail trimmer.

03:38.656 --> 03:40.023
So this was--

03:40.091 --> 03:41.257
Ultrasonic earwax recycler.

03:41.325 --> 03:42.258
Ew!

03:42.326 --> 03:46.062
I don't understand it.
My calculations were flawless!

03:46.130 --> 03:50.767
Oh-- oh-- I forgot to convert
from metric.

03:50.835 --> 03:56.271
How did I make such a stupid
mistake?

03:56.339 --> 04:00.042
With my heightened--

04:00.110 --> 04:03.880
you know, intelligence...
stuff, I should be more

04:03.947 --> 04:06.115
gooder...

04:06.182 --> 04:09.684
at the thinking...
thing.

04:09.752 --> 04:10.886
Um, Kowalski.

04:10.953 --> 04:14.956
That sounded kind of not so
smartery.

04:15.024 --> 04:19.293
You don't suppose that
whose-a-dingit thing I did with

04:19.361 --> 04:24.264
my brain was just tempo--
tem-- tem--

04:24.332 --> 04:25.465
Temporary?

04:25.534 --> 04:27.501
Uh-huh, that one.

04:29.070 --> 04:32.372
I like peanuts and I like butter

04:32.440 --> 04:37.244
but I do not like peanut butter.
Weird!

04:37.311 --> 04:40.346
Something's gone horribly
wrong with Kowalski's brain.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.750
Private, until we resolve this,
you're my new options guy.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.751
Oh, man.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.752
Yay!

04:45.819 --> 04:47.754
Now, how do we fix Kowalski?
Options.

04:47.821 --> 04:51.390
Oh. Um...
ask Kowalski?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.560
Rico, you're my new options
man.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.327
How do we fix Kowalski?

04:55.395 --> 04:57.262
Bing!

04:57.329 --> 04:59.264
Fine, we go with the
Private's plan.

04:59.331 --> 05:03.035
Kowalski, concentrate real hard.

05:03.102 --> 05:05.604
How do we help you?

05:05.672 --> 05:11.309
Eggs are...
egg-shaped.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.476
That's funny.

05:12.544 --> 05:13.477
Oh, boy.

05:13.545 --> 05:15.613
So we're stuck with a stupid
Kowalski.

05:15.681 --> 05:17.715
Well, maybe it's a good thing.
I mean, we were all getting

05:17.783 --> 05:21.452
tired of his big, highfalutin'
words like recalcitrant, right?

05:21.519 --> 05:24.254
I mean, what is that?
"Recalcitrant."

05:24.322 --> 05:26.090
Do I look recalcitrant to you?

05:26.157 --> 05:27.291
Mm-hm.

05:27.358 --> 05:30.560
Oh, yeah.
Up high!

05:30.628 --> 05:31.962
But Skipper--

05:32.029 --> 05:34.163
No buts, Private.
I've had it with your buts.

05:34.231 --> 05:35.164
(Snickering)

05:35.232 --> 05:36.566
Butts.

05:36.634 --> 05:37.801
Let's concentrate on what we

05:37.868 --> 05:40.536
can fix, starting with our grub
situation.

05:40.605 --> 05:42.205
Operation Fish Fry is--

05:42.272 --> 05:45.574
how did you even manage that?

05:45.642 --> 05:49.044
Can't hear you!
Toilet stick on face!

05:53.549 --> 05:54.850
Seafood truck approaching.

05:54.918 --> 05:56.852
Check.
I see it too.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.354
I want those tires flatter than
a flounder.

05:59.422 --> 06:02.790
Right.
Deploying thumbtacks.

06:02.858 --> 06:04.859
Um, anyone seen the thumbtacks?

06:07.195 --> 06:08.730
Hey.

06:08.797 --> 06:11.065
Mm?
Oh.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.134
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

06:16.704 --> 06:18.705
Truck in position.

06:21.976 --> 06:23.977
Well done, men.

06:26.714 --> 06:29.082
Last chance.
Private, distract the driver.

06:29.150 --> 06:32.718
Rico, neutralize the lock.
Kowalski?

06:32.786 --> 06:36.022
You keep doing whatever it is
you're doing. I guess.

06:36.089 --> 06:38.090
Aye-aye, Skipper!

06:41.294 --> 06:43.295
You think you're so smart!

06:46.800 --> 06:49.100
(Clanging)

06:49.168 --> 06:52.971
Boys, do you smell what I
smell--

06:55.975 --> 06:58.442
This situation is not
sustainable.

06:58.510 --> 07:00.645
Yes.
I want the old Kowalski back.

07:00.713 --> 07:02.647
Huh?
Oh, yeah, that too.

07:02.715 --> 07:04.648
I was talking about our lack of
lunch.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.717
(Stomach grumbling)

07:08.086 --> 07:09.853
It's that blasted feed system,

07:09.921 --> 07:12.890
squeezing the ever-loving life
out of us.

07:12.957 --> 07:15.625
I'm wasting away to nothing!

07:15.694 --> 07:18.195
Well, now, Skipper.
Not quite.

07:18.262 --> 07:20.863
I mean, you've still got a bit
of a spare tire, don't you?

07:20.931 --> 07:23.499
And some more on top of--

07:23.567 --> 07:24.500
(Laughing nervously)

07:24.568 --> 07:25.968
Gosh, you're thin.

07:26.036 --> 07:28.637
We've got to slap that
contraption into shape.

07:28.706 --> 07:30.707
Yay a missio-

07:33.077 --> 07:35.311
I forgot... how t... to swim!

07:35.378 --> 07:37.913
You're an aquatic bird,
Kowalski!

07:38.014 --> 07:40.281
I'm a beaver?

07:40.349 --> 07:42.350
Rico, go diving for dummies.

07:45.788 --> 07:48.323
I want a bungle-free
operation.

07:48.357 --> 07:51.226
Kowalski, you're on line duty.

07:51.293 --> 07:55.162
I want you to follow this line.

07:55.230 --> 07:57.798
And don't stop until you reach
the end.

07:57.866 --> 07:59.934
<i>You comprende?</i>

08:00.001 --> 08:02.302
Do you "understande"?

08:02.370 --> 08:04.338
I'm on it, Skipper!

08:04.405 --> 08:06.340
Follow the line, follow the
line.

08:06.407 --> 08:08.407
Follow the line, follow the
line.

08:08.475 --> 08:13.213
Follow the le,e, follow the
line-- ahh!

08:13.280 --> 08:16.750
Ah!
I've lost the line!

08:16.817 --> 08:18.718
Where is the line?

08:18.786 --> 08:20.954
You just crossed it, buddy
boy.

08:21.021 --> 08:23.022
(Screaming)

08:28.394 --> 08:30.462
One fish?
Ridiculous!

08:30.529 --> 08:33.932
Let's slap a zero on that
bad boy.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.333
PRIVATE: Ten fish!
Well done, Skipper.

08:36.402 --> 08:39.203
Good, but it's missing a
little something.

08:39.272 --> 08:41.905
Ooh, I know.

08:41.974 --> 08:43.741
Yay!

08:43.808 --> 08:47.011
Just got to let these
computers know who's boss.

08:50.215 --> 08:52.449
I was in a tree.

08:52.517 --> 08:57.320
Listen to me, computer!
I am the boss!

08:59.490 --> 09:01.424
Hey, guys.

09:01.492 --> 09:04.594
I added eleventeen zeros.
Hey!

09:04.662 --> 09:06.663
Ahh!

09:08.332 --> 09:11.301
No, no.
I do not want penguin for lunch.

09:11.368 --> 09:16.038
Gives me the gasses.
Perhaps another water bird.

09:16.106 --> 09:17.807
Is the beaver fresh today?

09:17.874 --> 09:20.976
Nothing personal, you
understand.

09:23.814 --> 09:26.949
Line!
I found you!

09:27.017 --> 09:28.416
Oh, boys, it won't be long

09:28.483 --> 09:31.119
before we're hip-deep in
halibut.

09:31.187 --> 09:32.453
Oh, Skipper!

09:32.521 --> 09:36.324
I lost the line for a while but
I found it again!

09:36.391 --> 09:40.328
Ow!
Hey!

09:40.395 --> 09:43.497
It's raining fish.
On my head.

09:43.565 --> 09:45.933
Skipper, I think that might
be more than 100 fish.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.034
Help!

09:47.101 --> 09:50.437
I forgot... how to... 
swim in fish!

09:52.740 --> 09:54.808
Kowalski!

09:54.876 --> 09:55.809
(Sniffing)

09:55.877 --> 09:58.578
Mm!
Fish?

09:58.646 --> 10:01.513
Yup, that's fish.

10:01.581 --> 10:05.651
I like fish.
They taste nummy.

10:05.719 --> 10:07.720
And they have googly eyes.

10:08.922 --> 10:12.124
And they travel in schools.

10:12.192 --> 10:15.927
Schools.
That's because they're so smart.

10:17.596 --> 10:19.397
No, that's not right.

10:19.465 --> 10:21.532
Fish are stupid but--

10:23.002 --> 10:25.570
Eureka!

10:25.637 --> 10:28.573
Oh, the brain is back, baby!

10:28.640 --> 10:31.376
Kowalski!
Are you smart again?

10:31.443 --> 10:32.809
Or at least less stupid?

10:32.878 --> 10:35.512
Do alkaline earth metals have
a +2 charge?

10:35.580 --> 10:36.646
He's back.

10:36.714 --> 10:40.550
But how did you restore your
beautiful mind?

10:40.618 --> 10:42.586
Fish are brain food.

10:42.653 --> 10:43.787
Brain food?

10:43.855 --> 10:44.788
Yes.

10:44.856 --> 10:45.789
You see, fish are rich in

10:45.857 --> 10:48.791
omega-3 fatty acids like
eicosa-pentanoic acid and its

10:48.859 --> 10:51.560
brainy buddy
docosahexaenoic acid.

10:51.628 --> 10:52.828
Boring!

10:52.897 --> 10:54.864
It sure is nice to have the
old Kowalski back.

10:54.932 --> 10:58.167
(Explosion)
Ahh!

10:58.235 --> 10:59.769
It sure is, young Private.
