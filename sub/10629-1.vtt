[Lucas] <i>Mayda slides her fingers in...</i>

00:10.761 --> 00:13.471
<i>all the way up to her...
her wedding ring.</i>

00:14.890 --> 00:19.019
She pushes you onto your back
and leans down.

00:20.688 --> 00:24.692
Puts the fingers into your mouth
so you can... taste them.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.029
- The gold of the ring...
- [man grunts]

00:32.406 --> 00:35.368
[Lucas] You could taste the sting
of the metal on your tongue...

00:37.370 --> 00:41.249
mixed with the taste of her cunt.

00:42.585 --> 00:45.713
She leans down,
whispers in your ear,

00:45.796 --> 00:48.591
"I love you, Gagik. Ah.

00:48.674 --> 00:49.842
- I love you."
- [groans]

00:49.925 --> 00:53.178
- I'm close, man.
- She straddles you, pulls you inside...

00:53.846 --> 00:57.725
grinds her hips back and forth,
back and forth...

00:57.808 --> 01:01.478
[Gagik grunting loudly]

01:03.731 --> 01:05.147

01:08.777 --> 01:11.905
Ah, damn, you're good with words.

"...New Hampshire for over 200 years.

02:55.133 --> 02:57.219
There've been ups and downs
along the way.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.638
Like the big A-mos-ke-ag."

03:00.723 --> 03:03.100
- Am... Amos...
- [knocking on door]

03:03.183 --> 03:04.184
Do you have her?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.105
She won't get on the phone.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.690
- Then get her detail on the phone.
- I did.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.944
They can't force her to talk to you, sir.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.531
We need to think about what to say
when I show up at this event

03:18.615 --> 03:19.783
and she's not with me.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.285
And I don't want to make it worse
by mispronouncing this.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.453
How do you say this word?

03:23.536 --> 03:25.736
They didn't put in the goddamn phonetics
in this speech!

03:25.789 --> 03:28.751
And I can't be expected
to look this shit up myself!

03:29.752 --> 03:31.378
I'll find out for you, sir.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.639
[Frank] <i>And of course, there's been...</i>

03:42.723 --> 03:44.808
"...ups and downs along the way."

03:44.892 --> 03:49.146
Like the big Amoskeag strike
in the 1920s over pay and hours.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.732
But this industry survived that as well.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.483
[all cheering]

03:55.819 --> 03:58.696
And all of you in this room
have been carrying on a tradition

03:58.781 --> 04:01.283
that goes back
to the beginning of this country,

04:01.366 --> 04:04.119
and that's something you have to be
very, very proud of!

04:04.202 --> 04:05.703
[all cheering]

04:08.040 --> 04:10.250
"But there's another tradition
in this state:

04:10.333 --> 04:12.294
Live Free or Die.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.921
Now, my wife..."

04:35.150 --> 04:37.069
There's another tradition in this state:

04:38.153 --> 04:39.696
Live Free or Die.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.949
Live Free or Die.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.159
[all cheering]

04:48.413 --> 04:50.665
Now, of course, as some of you
may read in the papers,

04:50.748 --> 04:53.085
and, uh, hear from the television pundits

04:53.168 --> 04:57.130
that my opponent has a ten-point lead
here in New Hampshire.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.298
- [all booing]
- But...

05:00.926 --> 05:05.138
you're not gonna let polls and pundits
tell you what to do.

05:05.222 --> 05:09.267
- [all] No!
- Or tell you how to vote on Election Day.

05:09.351 --> 05:13.814
You are gonna show them that
New Hampshire makes up its own mind.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.565
[all cheering]

05:16.191 --> 05:19.652
Thank you! Thank you all
for coming out today.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.030
And God bless America.
Thank you.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.871
[all chanting] Underwood!
Underwood! Underwood!

05:28.954 --> 05:30.788
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.125
Thank you all.
Thank you all very much.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.168
Thank you.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.379
She landed in Dallas ten minutes ago.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.756
Our story is she's down there
laying groundwork for the primary.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.883
That only gives us a day or two.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.218
If she's not doing events,
they'll think we're hiding something.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.427
[Doug] You think she'll stay put
on the ranch?

05:44.511 --> 05:47.014
I have no idea.
You keep track of all of her movements.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.556
Visitors, names, times,

05:48.640 --> 05:50.350
the color of their shit
and how much it stinks.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.519
- Yes, sir.
- And I want you on a plane.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.313
- Back to Washington?
- Down to Texas.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.502
[sighs]

06:50.118 --> 06:53.163
[footsteps approaching]

06:58.835 --> 07:01.629
- Where is she?
- The master bedroom.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.431
[breathes deeply]

07:27.905 --> 07:30.408
[man] Mrs. Hale mentioned
that she might take a nap.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.705
[Claire] Is my room made up?
[man] It's being dusted right now.

07:35.788 --> 07:38.625
[Claire] I'd like to take a look.
[man] Yes, ma'am.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.918
[footsteps departing]

08:08.071 --> 08:11.366
[indistinct radio chatter]

08:26.381 --> 08:27.882
[all cheering]

08:29.592 --> 08:31.094
Well, Texas is an important state.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.679
Nearly 10% of the delegates
we need for the nomination.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.807
But you said the First Lady
would be here with you today.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.770
Yes, well, when we assessed
things this morning,

08:37.808 --> 08:39.019
we felt good about New Hampshire.

08:39.102 --> 08:41.438
I mean, look at this crowd,
the enthusiasm.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.606
Hello, hello.
Oh, my goodness.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.650
Hello there, aren't you a cutie?
What's your name?

08:45.733 --> 08:47.277
- Gabby.
- Hello, Gabby.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.112
Anyway, we wanted
to start looking ahead.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.781
Claire's from Texas, so it made sense
for her to head down there early.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.451
Hello. Hello.
Thank you for coming out. Hi.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.786
I can't do my job
if you keep me in the dark.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.539
[Doug] <i>All you need to know</i>
<i>is what you put out in the statement.</i>

08:59.622 --> 09:00.742
- Was it an argument?
<i>- Seth.</i>

09:00.790 --> 09:03.501
Look, I'm working 20 hours a day here
on a normal day

09:03.585 --> 09:05.420
with the campaign in full swing,
and now this is on my plate?

09:05.503 --> 09:09.049
Look, I can do damage control,
but I have to know what the damage is.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.468
Okay. I'll fill you in.
Let me get up to my room.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.387
Welcome to Dallas.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.306
Or maybe it's a decoy,

09:16.389 --> 09:18.516
trying to lure us into making
ad-buys in Texas.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.852
[man] That would explain
why it wasn't part of her schedule.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.730
- Have you spoken to our friends in Dallas?
- No meetings or calls.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.690
If she were making the rounds,
we'd know.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.692
Well, they're either excellent
at covering their tracks,

09:27.775 --> 09:29.026
or something's up.

09:29.111 --> 09:31.446
- Like what?
- I don't know, but I wanna find out.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.241
[Gagik breathing heavily]

09:35.950 --> 09:39.621
[grunts] She's gonna fucking leave me.
My kid in her belly.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.749
And she gonna act like I never existed.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.169
Probably pawned the wedding ring already.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.756
[grunting]

09:52.008 --> 09:54.219
- How many is that?
- Two more.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.720
[grunting]

09:59.432 --> 10:00.850
[panting]

10:00.933 --> 10:03.395
- [Lucas] Can you blame her, though?
- Yeah, I can blame her.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.897
I gave her everything.
She gonna rob me of my kid?

10:05.980 --> 10:07.274
[panting]

10:07.357 --> 10:08.900
He's gonna be in high school
before you're out.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.303
I'll still be his fucking father.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.654
You gotta let them move on, man.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.282
- It's unfair not to.
- Let me tell you about unfair.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.284
Okay? Unfair is I'm even in here,

10:17.367 --> 10:19.161
and that fucking bitch
doesn't even know it.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.163
She thinks I belong in this shithole?

10:22.539 --> 10:24.081
[panting]

10:25.542 --> 10:27.294
[Lucas] You did kill a guy.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.008
- Are you saying you didn't?
- I didn't say shit.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.010
Because I...

10:36.093 --> 10:37.512
I had my doubts.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.141
What do you mean your doubts?

10:41.224 --> 10:42.809
- Hmm?
- Just...

10:42.892 --> 10:44.394
never struck me as a killer, that's all.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.229
[grunting]

10:47.480 --> 10:49.566
- You don't know what I am!
- [chokes]

10:51.776 --> 10:53.320
[choking] Come on!

10:53.403 --> 10:55.238
Let up! I can't breathe.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.407
[coughing]

11:02.537 --> 11:03.788
[Lucas spits]

11:05.790 --> 11:07.209
All I'm saying is...

11:08.960 --> 11:10.337
I interviewed a lot of murder suspects

11:10.420 --> 11:12.300
- when I was on the crime beat.
- [sighs deeply]

11:16.468 --> 11:18.052
I think you're innocent.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.640
I think you didn't do it.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.232
These guys, they'll skin you alive.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.984
Make you watch in a mirror
while they do it.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.110
What guys?

11:37.154 --> 11:39.031
You ever hear of Armenian Power in LA?

11:39.866 --> 11:42.702
- No.
- Their top guy.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.375
No way that motherfucker
was going to jail, huh?

11:49.584 --> 11:50.627
I didn't have a choice.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.130
- [Lucas] <i>So, you didn't do it?</i>
- [Gagik inhales deeply]

11:54.213 --> 11:57.800
[Gagik] <i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>what I did or what I didn't do.</i>

11:59.135 --> 12:01.178
<i>It matters what I said I did.</i>

12:01.263 --> 12:03.473
[Lucas] <i>Who did you take the fall for?</i>

12:23.993 --> 12:26.996
<i>A national</i> Wall Street Telegraph <i>poll</i>

<i>he's their first choice,</i>

- Yes, sir?
- Claire's clothes are here.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.356

and we neglected to adjust.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.205

- Yes, sir.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.584

- I'm fine.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.574
It's late.
You should get some sleep.

17:12.656 --> 17:13.741
I'll stay if you like.

17:16.492 --> 17:19.163
I think I'd like to be alone,
but thank you.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.748
Of course, sir.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.729
Watch your step, please.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.242
- [Claire] LeAnn.
- Mrs. Underwood.

17:58.035 --> 18:00.079
- Let's take a walk.
- Of course.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.585
[Claire] You've made the Democrats
relevant again in a very red state.

18:05.668 --> 18:08.295
[LeAnn] You want me to help
ramp up the Texas operation?

18:08.379 --> 18:10.798
No, I'm not here for the primary.

18:11.716 --> 18:15.720
I'm here to run for the 30th,
and I want you to run my campaign.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.054
The White House is saying
that you're here to...

18:17.138 --> 18:20.892
That's just so we don't draw attention
to the congressional race.

18:20.975 --> 18:23.603
Doris Jones, her daughter's running.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.980
The congresswoman
would need to be convinced.

18:26.063 --> 18:27.815
You're saying Celia bows out?

18:27.899 --> 18:31.318
She waits. In two years, the seat is hers.
Four at the most.

18:31.402 --> 18:35.072
- Senate?
- Possibly. Or governor, 2020.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.616
And the president's on board with this?

18:36.699 --> 18:37.992
Completely.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.127
[LeAnn] Look, even if you could
convince Celia,

18:43.164 --> 18:45.750
there's still a big problem. [sighs]

18:45.833 --> 18:48.502
[Claire] That I'm white.
[LeAnn] Lily white.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.255
In your designer heels
and tailored dresses, I mean...

18:52.381 --> 18:54.591
look at this property, Mrs. Underwood.
[sighs]

18:55.176 --> 18:58.888
A woman who marched with Dr. King
is not gonna have much patience for...

18:59.931 --> 19:01.015
For what?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.185
An outsider.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.855
Well, I believe we can change
her opinion of me.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.775
Look, I don't mind
betting against the odds.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.695
If I did, I wouldn't be consulting
for Democrats in Texas.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.197
- But what you're asking me...
- When you started your firm, LeAnn,

19:16.280 --> 19:19.491
your father told mine
that you were making a huge mistake.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.493
That's because he was a Republican.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.288
Yes, but you didn't make
a mistake, did you?

19:24.371 --> 19:25.790
You proved him wrong.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.752
Now, a dozen consultants
can tell me why this won't work,

19:29.836 --> 19:32.922
but I think you can tell me why it can.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.137
Meechum said she was in there
for over an hour.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.555
[Doug] <i>We don't own Harvey.</i>

19:42.098 --> 19:43.766
Vaughn thinks she's been
holding out for Dunbar.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.102
<i>She wouldn't be meeting
with her about the primary.</i>

19:46.185 --> 19:48.187
Maybe she thinks
she can run for something.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.315
- What? This cycle?
<i>- Elected office has always been her goal.</i>

19:51.398 --> 19:54.694
There aren't any open races.
Not in Texas. Except for Doris Jones.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.238
Yeah, but her daughter's
running for that seat.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.865
<i>She hasn't announced yet.</i>

19:58.948 --> 20:00.867
Which gives Claire an opening.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.369
[elevator dings]

20:09.834 --> 20:10.835
Hello?

20:25.557 --> 20:27.643
- Hello?
- [Doug] LeAnn?

20:28.685 --> 20:31.773
[chuckles] Hi.
Doug Stamper.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.817
Wasn't sure if I was in the right...
Wow.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.444
Is that how you say hi in Texas?

20:37.528 --> 20:40.447
[chuckles] Sorry, the elevators are
usually locked down on the weekends.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.200
We've had some burglaries in the building.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.244
- It's nice to meet you, Doug.
- Pleasure.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.413
Mrs. Underwood didn't tell me
you were in town.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.749
I just got in.
President thought it'd be a good idea

20:49.832 --> 20:51.458
if I were here to help
coordinate on the campaign.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.627
Well, I'm not officially on board yet.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.172
I wanted to see how
the meeting goes tomorrow.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.673
The meeting?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.801
Doris Jones.
The First Lady didn't tell you?

20:59.884 --> 21:00.885
No.

21:01.635 --> 21:02.719
Will you excuse me for a moment?

21:02.804 --> 21:05.597
- I just have to make a quick call.
- Of course.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.142
[phone beeps]

21:10.311 --> 21:12.479
[Doug speaking indistinctly]

21:25.451 --> 21:26.786
It's the president.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.748
Hello?

21:31.833 --> 21:34.168
[Frank] <i>Doug tells me</i>
<i>you greeted him with a firearm.</i>

21:34.251 --> 21:35.795
[chuckles] Yeah, we've been
having some issues with...

21:35.878 --> 21:38.130
<i>Do you know what fascinates me
about guns, LeAnn?</i>

21:38.214 --> 21:40.842
You pull a trigger and bang,
a bullet explodes out

21:40.925 --> 21:42.634
faster than the speed of sound.

21:42.718 --> 21:44.220
And if you're on
the wrong end of that bullet,

21:44.303 --> 21:47.473
- why, it hits you before you even hear it.
- Mr. President, forgive me, but...

21:47.556 --> 21:49.851
<i>No, I want you to hear me, LeAnn.</i>

21:49.934 --> 21:52.603
<i>You will walk away
from this nonsense with Claire.</i>

21:52.686 --> 21:54.771
<i>You will not make a phone call
nor answer one.</i>

21:54.856 --> 21:56.983
<i>You will offer no explanation.</i>

21:57.066 --> 21:58.943
Whatever you discussed with my wife,

21:59.026 --> 22:02.529
you will erase it from your mind
and never speak of it again.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.324
<i>Tell me I've been heard.</i>

22:05.407 --> 22:06.617
Yes, I heard you.

22:07.534 --> 22:08.828
Good.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.624
[closes phone]

22:14.458 --> 22:15.792
[Doug] This is cute.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.754
Put it down, please.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.302
Souvenir.

22:29.265 --> 22:30.975
I'll take that phone, too.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.772
Have a good night.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.945
How soon?

22:43.029 --> 22:45.072
The judge is reviewing
the Rule 35 order now.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.283
I mean, once he signs it,
if they make an arrest,

22:47.366 --> 22:48.534
it won't take these guys long
to figure out

22:48.617 --> 22:50.202
it was me that talked to the Feds.

22:50.286 --> 22:53.539
Well, once he signs,
it'll be a matter of hours, not days.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.874
The WITSEC arrangements
are already being made.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.753
- You know where they're sending me?
- Nope.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.964
And I never will.
Nobody will.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.215
Except for the DOJ.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.779
If you need to reach me for anything,

23:04.841 --> 23:06.885
you're gonna have to contact me
through the WITSEC officer.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.720
It's not just the Armenians I'm afraid of.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.264
- [sighs] Lucas...
- I know you never believed me

23:10.347 --> 23:12.891
- about the president but...
- Look. Listen carefully.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.313
The U.S. government is not your enemy now.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.691
Okay? They're protecting you.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.444
He is the government.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.655
Not even the White House knows
who gets released on Rule 35.

23:28.157 --> 23:31.368
Unless the Attorney General tells them,
which almost never happens.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.914
[sighs] Listen.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.500
- You did good work here, Lucas.
- [scoffs]

23:39.751 --> 23:41.420
You're getting out.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.966
Try to be happy about that.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.263
[rock music playing]

24:01.023 --> 24:02.566
This how you unwind?

24:02.649 --> 24:04.110
I've never been here in my life.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.487
I wanted some place
we wouldn't be recognized.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.823
Rack 'em up.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.413
[clears throat]

24:16.497 --> 24:19.250
- You said you had something to offer.
- Yes.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.711
Insurance.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.131
We took Iowa.
We're closing the gap in New Hampshire.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.133
You squeaked by in Iowa.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.343
You're not gonna close the gap
in New Hampshire by Tuesday.

24:29.426 --> 24:33.097
- You're overconfident.
- And you're still Press Secretary.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.059
He didn't make you Chief of Staff.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.561
Don't tell me you weren't angling for it.

24:40.396 --> 24:41.688
What's your ask?

24:42.689 --> 24:45.151
One solid thing for us to work with.

24:46.443 --> 24:47.986
It tanks him, you got a cushion.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.280
It doesn't?

24:49.363 --> 24:51.073
You still have your job
in the White House.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.575
Why should I trust you?

24:59.998 --> 25:03.419
Wouldn't you rather have
a back-up plan in your pocket if you lose?

25:08.674 --> 25:09.800
Your shot.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.845
We guarantee you
a place in our administration

25:13.929 --> 25:16.515
after my two years as Chief of Staff.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.724
Then it's you.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.353
Tell me what's happening in Texas.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.236
[sirens blaring]

25:37.661 --> 25:39.121
[sirens stop]

25:52.426 --> 25:56.180
- [Doris] Mrs. Underwood.
- Congresswoman, so good to see you.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.350
Wonderful to see you, too.
Please, come in.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.817
Celia, so good to see you, too.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.238
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Underwood.

26:12.321 --> 26:15.574
LeAnn called me a little while ago.
Said she couldn't make it.

26:19.620 --> 26:23.499
Congresswoman, I asked LeAnn
to have this meeting set up

26:23.582 --> 26:27.878
because I have a radical proposal,
and I wanted to make it in person.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.299
Well, Doug has already filled me in.

26:33.091 --> 26:37.012
Usually, I wouldn't endorse
anyone four years out,

26:37.095 --> 26:39.681
but in this case,
I'm really open to it.

26:39.765 --> 26:44.145
Anything to put a Democrat
into the governor's mansion.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.896
[Doug] I told the congresswoman that

26:45.979 --> 26:48.899
enlisting her political machinery
in Dallas is a crucial first step.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.236
[Doris] Which is why
I asked my daughter to join us.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.447
She'll have my seat by then,
and you two will work closely.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.034
I have a great deal of respect for you,
Mrs. Underwood.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.453
I think we can accomplish a lot together.

27:01.537 --> 27:02.663
[Claire] Well, actually, Congresswoman,

27:02.746 --> 27:05.040
I've decided that
the governorship is a big leap

27:05.123 --> 27:07.876
without holding any elected office first.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.879
Are you thinking Senate next cycle?

27:10.962 --> 27:14.550
No, I'm thinking
your district, this cycle.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.427
That would mean your daughter holds off,

27:16.510 --> 27:19.137
and then I would throw
my full weight behind her

27:19.221 --> 27:21.182
to replace me when I run for governor.

27:21.265 --> 27:22.683
I've already put together my team.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.311
Oh, no, you would still
get the seat, Celia.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.563
I'm just asking you
to wait a little longer.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.315
And the president
thinks this is the best plan.

27:29.398 --> 27:32.108
[Doris] Why didn't you tell me this?

27:32.193 --> 27:35.111
- I wasn't aware, ma'am.
- Well, he and I spoke privately about it.

27:35.196 --> 27:39.908
Celia has waited over a decade
for me to retire.

27:39.991 --> 27:40.992
It's her time.

27:41.076 --> 27:42.369
I understand.

27:42.453 --> 27:45.956
And that's why I want to put her
in the best position to succeed

27:46.039 --> 27:48.459
- when she takes office.
- When was the last time

27:48.542 --> 27:51.628
you set foot in this district?

27:51.712 --> 27:53.630
When Francis was elected whip.

27:53.714 --> 27:56.383
So, how are we supposed
to ask our people to support a woman

27:56.467 --> 27:58.134
that doesn't even know them?

27:58.219 --> 28:00.512
Their lives, their everyday struggles.

28:00.596 --> 28:01.722
Carpetbagger.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.557
Who's white.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.852
[Doris] It goes deeper than race,
Mrs. Underwood.

28:06.935 --> 28:11.398
You grew up in Highland Park,
never wanted for anything.

28:11.482 --> 28:15.193
You just don't reflect our community.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.238
[Doug] Congresswoman makes a good point.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.285
What I want is a stepping stone.

28:23.369 --> 28:27.373
And what you want is federal funding
for a breast cancer center

28:27.456 --> 28:29.165
run by Planned Parenthood.

28:31.001 --> 28:34.004
Something that a Republican-controlled
Congress will never do.

28:35.088 --> 28:36.923
Especially in a VA hospital.

28:37.007 --> 28:40.261
You had resistance even when
the Democrats controlled the House.

28:41.345 --> 28:44.473
But there's not one congressperson,
Republican or Democrat,

28:44.556 --> 28:46.308
that would refuse a meeting
with the First Lady.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.560
You're right, Mrs. Underwood.

28:50.312 --> 28:53.940
We haven't accomplished
everything we set out to do.

28:54.024 --> 28:57.861
But the one thing
my constituents have always had...

28:58.445 --> 29:04.826
is the pride that they take
in being represented by one of their own.

29:06.412 --> 29:10.249
I refuse to rob them of that.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.419
Thank you for your time, Congresswoman.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.463
We'll reassess our thinking
and get back to you. Thank you.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.852
You tell the president
to stay out of this.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.229
Maybe you should speak to him directly.

29:33.314 --> 29:36.775
As soon as he's willing
to support this race, I'll talk to him.

29:36.858 --> 29:39.235
You're making a mistake, Mrs. Underwood.

29:56.587 --> 29:59.631
<i>A source within
the White House tells us this,</i>

29:59.715 --> 30:01.300
<i>that the First Lady traveled to Texas</i>

30:01.383 --> 30:04.386
<i>after some sort of a major
argument with her husband.</i>

30:04.470 --> 30:06.305
<i>Well, the president has claimed
that she went to Dallas</i>

30:06.388 --> 30:08.765
<i>to lay groundwork for the Texas primary.</i>

30:08.849 --> 30:12.394
<i>But there's no evidence
of any campaign events or fundraisers</i>

30:12.478 --> 30:14.646
<i>since she arrived there three days ago,</i>

30:14.730 --> 30:16.815
<i>and she hasn't appeared publicly.</i>

30:16.898 --> 30:19.776
<i>- So, Monica, gotta get your take on this.</i>
- [chuckles]

30:19.860 --> 30:21.653
<i>Well, if there is marital discord,</i>

30:21.737 --> 30:24.114
<i>the Underwoods certainly
wouldn't want to admit it.</i>

30:24.197 --> 30:27.743
<i>Her being down there for the primary?
Come on, that could be a smokescreen.</i>

30:27.826 --> 30:30.107
- [Gretchen] <i>Juan?</i>
<i>- Well, come on, Gretchen. Let's be real.</i>

30:30.161 --> 30:31.913
<i>Something's rotten
in the state of Denmark.</i>

30:31.997 --> 30:33.874
<i>I mean, the timing on this
could not be worse.</i>

30:33.957 --> 30:37.127
<i>Don't forget,
the New Hampshire primary is tomorrow.</i>

30:37.210 --> 30:40.046
<i>So, whatever momentum the president had
coming out of Iowa...</i>

30:40.130 --> 30:42.508
[imitates popping] <i>Just like</i>
<i>air going out of a popped balloon.</i>

30:42.591 --> 30:44.968
[laughs] <i>Well, you know</i>
<i>that Heather Dunbar</i>

30:45.051 --> 30:48.639
<i>is gonna have something to say about this.
Let's take a look.</i>

30:48.722 --> 30:51.182
<i>I don't know whether
this story is true or not,</i>

30:51.266 --> 30:54.269
<i>but if it is, I hope that
the president and the First Lady</i>

30:54.353 --> 30:56.480
<i>can work out their differences.</i>

30:56.563 --> 30:59.107
<i>No one likes to see
a marriage under strain.</i>

31:00.191 --> 31:02.528
<i>Personally, I wouldn't be able</i>

31:02.611 --> 31:05.447
<i>to carry on my campaign
without the incredible...</i>

31:05.531 --> 31:06.657
[Frank] Do we know
where the leak came from?

31:06.740 --> 31:09.618
[Seth over phone] <i>We're talking</i>
<i>to Secret Service and to staff now,</i>

31:09.701 --> 31:10.952
<i>but no, sir, we don't know yet.</i>

31:11.036 --> 31:12.704
I'm looking at a ten-pound
stack of clippings,

31:12.788 --> 31:14.915
and that's just what's been written
in the past hour.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.376
This is Dunbar.
I know she's behind this.

31:17.459 --> 31:19.420
Sir, I might have a solution.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.965
May we speak privately for a moment?

31:24.049 --> 31:25.717
[Frank] <i>Yeah. Seth, hop off the line.</i>

31:25.801 --> 31:27.260
If we're gonna switch tactics,
I think I should...

31:27.343 --> 31:30.096
[Doug] <i>I'll fill you in</i>
<i>if the president wants to move forward.</i>

31:30.180 --> 31:31.723
[Frank] <i>Hop off, Seth.</i>

31:31.807 --> 31:33.349
[Gretchen] <i>During the debates,</i>
<i>we all remember,</i>

31:33.434 --> 31:36.687
<i>Underwood went after Sharp
for sending her kids to private...</i>

31:37.228 --> 31:39.105
[Frank] <i>All right, go ahead.</i>

31:39.189 --> 31:40.273
Claire's mother.

31:40.356 --> 31:41.650
What about her?

31:59.960 --> 32:01.878
[door opens]

32:09.803 --> 32:12.013
[Elizabeth] I told you
when you were five years old

32:12.097 --> 32:15.266
not to come in this house
without saying hello to me.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.060
[Claire sighs]

32:17.143 --> 32:20.481
I came by when I arrived.
You were asleep.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.524
[Elizabeth] That was two days ago.

32:23.525 --> 32:25.445
Well, I wasn't sure you wanted
to see me, Mother.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.153
Well...

32:27.237 --> 32:31.492
as long as we're living
under the same roof

32:31.575 --> 32:35.036
- and besieged by news trucks...
- I apologize for all that.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.205
Is it true?

32:38.248 --> 32:40.416
Hmm? Is that why you came down here?

32:41.668 --> 32:43.920
No, I came down here because...

32:45.589 --> 32:47.508
Mmm-hmm.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.718
That woman who visited...

32:51.427 --> 32:54.139
- LeAnn Harvey.
- Mmm-hmm, I know who she is.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.976
She calls me all the time
asking for money when she's...

32:58.059 --> 33:02.313
[inhales sharply]
peddling some candidate.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.942
Are you the candidate?

33:07.903 --> 33:10.155
[clicks tongue] Congress. 30th District.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.616
I see.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.161
You don't approve. [sighs]

33:16.244 --> 33:19.706
[chuckles] Well, you've
always made your choices

33:19.790 --> 33:22.501
regardless of what I think.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.294
What does he think?

33:24.377 --> 33:26.880
Has he spoken to you?
To discourage me?

33:26.963 --> 33:30.801
He hasn't spoken to me
since the day of your daddy's funeral.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.261
Just like you haven't.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.306
Not even a phone call
when you became First Lady...

33:36.389 --> 33:38.629
If you don't want me here,
I can make other arrangements.

33:38.684 --> 33:43.438
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
This house is as much yours as it is mine.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.148
I put covers on everything

33:45.231 --> 33:48.777
because the maids were
cleaning rooms I never set foot in.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.071
But now that you're here...

33:51.154 --> 33:52.573
Just leave them.

33:53.364 --> 33:55.408
I only need a bedroom.

33:57.243 --> 33:59.079
Fine.

33:59.162 --> 34:02.457
This house is just a hotel to you.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.462
[breathes deeply]

34:08.714 --> 34:11.675
The president will arrive
in Dallas later this afternoon.

34:11.757 --> 34:14.510
As to the nature of his trip,
I can't comment at this time

34:14.594 --> 34:17.263
other than to say he plans
on seeing the First Lady.

34:17.347 --> 34:18.473
- [all clamoring] Seth!
- Mark.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.766
His going down there
would seem to lend legitimacy

34:20.851 --> 34:23.770
to claims that they're having
marital issues, wouldn't it?

34:23.853 --> 34:25.772
We've already denied those claims.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.608
- [all clamoring] Seth!
- Sara.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.748
Neither the president nor the First Lady

34:29.818 --> 34:31.902
have publicly responded
since this story broke.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.071
Can we expect them to?

34:33.154 --> 34:35.866
[stammers] What you're calling a story
isn't a story.

34:35.949 --> 34:38.784
It's a flashy headline that gives you
a bump in Twitter followers.

34:38.869 --> 34:40.245
It doesn't warrant a response,

34:40.328 --> 34:43.956
but if the president or First Lady
chooses to make one,

34:44.040 --> 34:45.208
you'll be the first to know.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.918
- [all clamoring] Seth!
- Thank you all very much.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.761
[indistinct conversations]

35:34.758 --> 35:37.010
- How long has she been gone?
- Not long.

35:37.093 --> 35:38.720
- LeAnn Harvey's office.
- Christ.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.180
The press didn't follow her, did they?

35:40.263 --> 35:42.974
No. They took a utility road out.
No police escort.

36:06.707 --> 36:08.709
[footsteps approaching]

36:14.881 --> 36:17.884
Are you two gonna make
a habit of showing up here

36:17.968 --> 36:21.096
without even the courtesy of asking?

36:21.179 --> 36:25.183
I wish I didn't have to be here,
but your daughter's made it necessary.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.601
You know, when she got married,

36:26.685 --> 36:29.688
I was sure she would wake up
in a year or two.

36:30.605 --> 36:34.150
I had no idea
it was gonna take her 30.

36:34.234 --> 36:37.237
Claire is the First Lady
of the United States,

36:37.320 --> 36:40.073
and you still think
she made the wrong choice.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.951
Reduced to tabloid gossip?

36:43.034 --> 36:46.329
She might as well be living
in that trailer park you come from.

36:46.412 --> 36:50.500
Well, it was a peach farm.
But you're right, I am still white trash.

36:50.583 --> 36:54.755
I just happen to be white trash
that lives in the White House.

36:55.338 --> 36:59.801
Not even being president
could give you any class.

37:02.637 --> 37:05.348
Well, let me tell you
what's about to happen, Elizabeth.

37:05.431 --> 37:07.726
[LeAnn] I am not going
to put myself in the crossfire

37:07.809 --> 37:09.519
between a president and First Lady.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.312
[Claire] Oh, I'll handle Francis.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.606
[LeAnn] You said he was on board.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.650
[Claire] And I'll make sure he is.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.944
[LeAnn] The point is you misled me,
Mrs. Underwood.

37:18.028 --> 37:21.239
What is it you want, LeAnn?
Is it money?

37:22.741 --> 37:25.201
Or do you want more,
to make a real mark?

37:25.285 --> 37:26.745
I don't have to choose.
I can have both.

37:26.828 --> 37:29.372
Well, if you wanna make history,
you need to get out of Texas.

37:29.455 --> 37:32.167
I've turned down plenty of jobs in D.C.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.335
Juggling 15 clients a year.

37:35.461 --> 37:40.133
But I want the next 15 years of your life.
Texas is just where we begin.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.660
It seems you didn't hear me after all.

38:07.743 --> 38:09.704
I don't respond to threats.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.957
[Doug] You're speaking
to the president.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.166
Yes, I recognize his voice.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.585
I'd like to talk to my wife alone, please.

38:15.668 --> 38:18.213
She stays.
Tell me what you need to tell me.

38:18.754 --> 38:20.465
[Frank sighs]

38:20.548 --> 38:21.883
Doug.

38:34.312 --> 38:38.733
She's been sick for three years.
Radiation, chemotherapy, the works.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.906
But you didn't know, did you?

38:47.242 --> 38:49.410
You're not dragging my mother
in front of the cameras.

38:49.494 --> 38:53.289
Just you, and you're going to say
that that's why you're down here.

38:53.373 --> 38:55.458
This is a family matter, Francis.

38:55.541 --> 38:58.837
This has to be done, Claire.
We have to kill this story.

38:59.921 --> 39:01.297
He's right.

39:04.926 --> 39:07.220
I need to know you won't meddle
with my campaign.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.865
The State of the Union is in two weeks.

39:10.891 --> 39:12.642
You show up for that,
then I'll leave you alone.

39:12.725 --> 39:14.477
Let's get this over with.

39:31.577 --> 39:34.580
- [reporters speaking indistinctly]
- [cameras clicking]

39:37.125 --> 39:38.885
When Claire first
came down here to Dallas...

39:39.585 --> 39:43.381
we said it was to lay the groundwork
for the Texas primary.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.383
And that was partially true.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.970
What we left out was something
that we hoped to keep private.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.847
But in light of false stories
over the last number of days

39:51.932 --> 39:53.683
about the state of our marriage,

39:53.766 --> 39:57.812
we now feel it's important
to share this unfortunate news.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.272
Claire.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.150
For the past three years,

40:02.233 --> 40:05.153
my mother has been suffering
from intermittent lymphoma.

40:06.237 --> 40:09.615
Initially, she had some success
battling her illness,

40:09.699 --> 40:12.410
but it's come back full force
the last several months.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.164
So, I came down here
to spend time with her

40:16.247 --> 40:18.708
while she undergoes further treatment.

40:18.791 --> 40:21.962
And we ask just for the sake
of my mother's dignity...

40:23.838 --> 40:27.342
and well-being
that you respect her privacy.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.011
Thank you.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.058
I will be resuming my campaign tomorrow

40:35.141 --> 40:38.228
and Claire will, of course,
be staying here.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.437
And let me just add...

40:41.147 --> 40:44.192
Claire's mother is blessed
to have such a loving daughter.

40:44.275 --> 40:47.862
And I am blessed to have
such a thoughtful and caring wife.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.489
Thank you all very much.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.182
Nothing fancy, but it'll do the job.

41:45.586 --> 41:48.673
You're officially John Carlyle now.

41:53.636 --> 41:57.890
Driver's license is expired on purpose.
You take the bus to work.

41:58.808 --> 42:01.727
Memorize everything,
address, birthday, social.

42:01.811 --> 42:04.855
There's a personal history in there
for you to know by heart, too.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.234
- "Pegasus Car Rentals"?
- Yeah.

42:08.318 --> 42:10.570
You wash rentals.
It starts tomorrow.

42:10.653 --> 42:11.987
Keep a low profile.

42:12.072 --> 42:14.949
Don't be weird about it,
don't go out of your way to make friends.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.284
[Lucas sighs]

42:17.285 --> 42:18.661
What if there's...

42:19.620 --> 42:21.497
If something's wrong?

42:21.581 --> 42:24.042
Landline goes directly
to our local office.

42:24.125 --> 42:27.045
Away from home,
use the cell phone next to it.

42:28.254 --> 42:32.342
What else? You have basic cable.
No Internet, obviously.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.054
Keep the blinds drawn
and the doors locked.

42:38.431 --> 42:40.015
That's it.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.148
I'll check in with you later this week.

42:56.532 --> 42:57.700
[door closes]

43:04.332 --> 43:06.041
[keys clatter]

43:10.963 --> 43:12.382
[sighs]

43:14.342 --> 43:16.219
[car engine starts]

43:22.433 --> 43:24.602
[car pulls away]

43:40.535 --> 43:42.287
- [crowd cheering]
- [Conway] <i>Now, we didn't just win</i>

43:42.370 --> 43:44.330
<i>a plurality here in New Hampshire.</i>

43:44.414 --> 43:46.166
<i>We won a majority.</i>

43:48.418 --> 43:51.337
<i>Now, you know what that tells me?</i>

43:51.421 --> 43:53.464
It's looking like Dunbar's got it
by 11 or 12 points

43:53.548 --> 43:55.133
by the time everything's counted.

43:55.216 --> 43:57.009
How many precincts have reported?

43:57.092 --> 43:59.512
As of two minutes ago, 83%.

44:01.264 --> 44:03.098
Seth drafted a speech for when we land.

44:03.808 --> 44:05.976
Normally, Dunbar would wait
to give her speech until after yours,

44:06.060 --> 44:07.102
but since we're on the plane...

44:07.187 --> 44:09.897
- Get her on the phone and I'll concede.
- Yes, sir.

44:12.942 --> 44:15.320
Look at that snot-nosed pretty-boy.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.822
I'll bet he just learned how to shave.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.076
- Get me Dunbar.
- [knocking]

44:23.494 --> 44:25.413
- Ma'am, I really think...
- Open it.

44:26.414 --> 44:28.249
She wants to be left alone.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.085
- Unlock the door.
- [sighs]

44:51.021 --> 44:53.148
[Elizabeth] I want you to go!

44:54.567 --> 44:56.068
Mother...

44:56.151 --> 44:57.820
why didn't you tell me?

44:57.903 --> 45:01.156
Because it was none of your business.

45:01.241 --> 45:04.410
- Just listen to me.
- No, don't even bother.

45:05.202 --> 45:09.039
I understand why you did what you did.

45:09.123 --> 45:12.835
But that doesn't make it any less hurtful.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.541
[Claire crying softly]

45:53.000 --> 45:55.503
Is that for me or for yourself?

45:59.590 --> 46:00.966
Claire.

46:02.051 --> 46:03.678
Come here.

46:06.639 --> 46:08.724
- Come here.
- [crying]

46:10.601 --> 46:12.978
You're stronger than he is.

46:14.271 --> 46:16.774
But you gotta put him in his place.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.108
[Claire sniffles]
