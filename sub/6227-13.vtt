00:01.043 --> 00:02.295
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.377 --> 00:04.345
I don't care if
this is a mistake.

00:05.297 --> 00:06.674
I love you.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.226
Still wanna call the cops?

00:10.302 --> 00:11.303
Tony! No!

00:19.770 --> 00:21.113
Holy crap.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.444
Check it out.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.859
I think it's bronze.
Those look like keyholes.

00:25.943 --> 00:27.616
Seven locks, seven keys.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.169
Little bastard. He bit me!

00:36.870 --> 00:39.089
Okay. There 'd better
be something inside that.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.757
This does not
look good.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.755
I think it's infected.
How does it feel?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.211
It hurts.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.214
It's a stick?

00:47.297 --> 00:48.469
Looks like a stick.

00:48.966 --> 00:49.966
I don't...

00:50.008 --> 00:51.055
Uh...

00:51.134 --> 00:53.432
- Whoa! Hey!
- Hey, buddy.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.138
You all right?

00:57.474 --> 00:58.566
What's happening?

00:59.268 --> 01:00.394
It's getting better.

01:04.772 --> 01:06.150
What did you do?

01:16.285 --> 01:17.285
It closed up.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.704
Yeah, the wound just
kind of faded away.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.255
- But how...
- Uh...

01:20.330 --> 01:21.923
Did that really just happen?

01:21.999 --> 01:24.001
I can't believe it.
How do you feel?

01:24.501 --> 01:25.501
Fine, I think.

01:25.544 --> 01:27.012
However it happened,
it's not normal.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.681
The last thing that happened
was I grabbed you.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.757
With the stick
in your hand.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.361
So, we're thinking
this is some kind of

01:32.426 --> 01:34.224
healing stick-magic
wand thing?

01:34.303 --> 01:35.930
What about the cloth
it was wrapped in?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.356
It had some kind
of writing on it.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.031
I couldn't tell
if it was writing or not.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.934
Yeah, but that could
just be marks.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.237
If it is writing, maybe
it tells us what that thing is.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.780
Even so,
it might not be the stick.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.335
It could be the cloth
or even the box.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.779
Okay, but if it is the piece
of wood, what does that mean?

01:48.859 --> 01:51.032
It doesn't mean anything until
we figure out how it works.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.711
Well, until we know,
it's not a good idea

01:52.779 --> 01:54.281
to have it fall
into the wrong hands.

01:54.364 --> 01:57.538
Yeah, which would explain why they
buried the thing in the first place.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.462
For right now,
nobody can know about this.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.915
So we keep this
to ourselves, right?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.045
I mean, we don't tell anyone.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.125
No one.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.378
Ironically, just like
the Crusaders agreed

02:07.461 --> 02:09.304
when they buried this
thing 800 years ago.

02:09.378 --> 02:12.258
Well, obviously they had no
idea how to deal with it either.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.809
At least until we figure out

02:13.884 --> 02:15.886
how to figure out what it is
we're dealing with.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.583
Just looking at you
makes my back hurt.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.081
After 40 years,
I'm used to it.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.205
What's this one?

02:43.288 --> 02:44.790
Cabeza Olmeca.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.776
Am I supposed to know
what that is?

02:49.336 --> 02:51.009
The Olmecas?

02:51.088 --> 02:53.637
First Mesoamerican
civilization?

02:54.049 --> 02:56.677
They carved these colossal
heads out of stone.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.555
Don't you care
anything for your history?

02:59.638 --> 03:01.936
Look, all I care about
is Kawama. Is he done?

03:02.307 --> 03:06.483
Yeah, he's done, but you gotta
take better care of him, man.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.780
It looks like you
gave him a camionazo.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.120
Come on, man, English.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.406
I feel sorry for you, man.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.912
I can't believe your parents
never taught you Spanish.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.957
That's because they really
didn't speak Spanish either.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.458
Hey.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.456
Good luck tonight.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.879
Yeah, whatever.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.964
Something wrong?

03:34.089 --> 03:36.592
I'm just sick of being a jobber.
Why?

03:37.134 --> 03:39.011
Tired of losing to guys
I could beat

03:39.094 --> 03:40.687
with both hands tied
behind my back.

03:40.762 --> 03:44.312
You get paid to lose, m'hijo. What
could be better? No pressure.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.393
I'm sick of people
thinking I'm a loser.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.403
You think winning
is the answer?

03:48.478 --> 03:51.778
I started fighting 'cause I
wanted to be like those guys.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.451
El Liberador, Tornado Tejano.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.154
The guys I grew up watching
when I was a kid.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.325
I wish I could wear
something cool like that.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.669
Well, that type of mask
is very expensive.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.463
But they never lost.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.756
There were other costs
to their victories.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.336
If I had a mask like that,
I would win.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.220
I believe it.
You remind me of them.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.512
Soul of a fighter.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.511
How much are they?

04:22.596 --> 04:26.021
They're one of a kind.
Special order.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.646
How much?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.358
Half of what you earn.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.689
Half? Are you crazy?

04:32.355 --> 04:35.700
You're not ready for a mask like
that till price doesn't matter.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.749
Thanks.
I'll see you later.

04:55.378 --> 04:59.224
All the
way from San Antonio, Texas.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.022
Weighing in at 190 pounds,

05:06.097 --> 05:10.477
tenemos Kawama!

05:21.071 --> 05:23.039
Kawama!

05:30.705 --> 05:35.051
Please give it up for the man
you've been waiting for,

05:35.418 --> 05:39.013
from our own Rose City,

05:39.297 --> 05:43.347
weighing in at 215 pounds.

05:46.721 --> 05:49.645
Mayordomo.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.407
You got served!

07:01.880 --> 07:07.683
Mayordomo!

07:15.185 --> 07:17.688
Fantastic job out
there tonight, buddy.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.904
You made Mayordomo
look fantéstico!

07:22.943 --> 07:25.287
Did you hear that crowd?
They loved him tonight!

07:25.362 --> 07:27.035
What a killing!

07:27.572 --> 07:28.869
Hey.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.700
Hey, what's this?

07:31.117 --> 07:32.334
You tore up your mask?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.125
I'm better than him.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.751
Yeah, so?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.708
I can beat him!
Buddy,

07:38.500 --> 07:40.753
that's not why I'm paying you.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.462
You're not in that ring
to make you look good,

07:42.545 --> 07:44.673
you're in that ring
to make Mayordomo look good.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.303
I'm tired of it!

07:46.383 --> 07:49.557
Too bad. You can boo-hoo-hoo
all the way to the bank.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.183
Now, you better
get this fixed.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.139
Without a new mask, you're not
getting back in that ring.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.313
Just give me one shot
to prove myself.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.935
Listen, buddy,

07:58.228 --> 08:00.322
you're just not
headliner material, I mean...

08:00.397 --> 08:03.992
Your technique is solid, but you
just don't have the pizazz.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.319
Plus, you don't speak Spanish.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.905
How come your parents never
taught you how to speak Spanish?

08:07.988 --> 08:11.208
Hey, look, you wanna quit?
I understand.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.910
I can't give you what you need.
No hard feelings.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.541
So, you either get a new mask
or adios, muchacho.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.091
Open the door.

08:25.714 --> 08:28.012
It's late.
What are you doing here?

08:28.091 --> 08:29.889
Look, I don't care
about the price anymore.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.854
Hey. You need to
think this over.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.931
You're too upset.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.688
Go home. Get some sleep.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.926
No. I don't want to think anything over.
I want to win.

08:58.705 --> 08:59.877
What's that?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.799
The contract.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.627
For what?
The mask.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.639
I have to sign
a contract for a mask?

09:09.215 --> 09:12.094
And you have to
sign it in blood.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.559
You're kidding.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.437
I wouldn't kid
about a mask like this.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.987
What is this,
some kind of magic?

09:23.063 --> 09:24.736
Something like that.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.788
What does it say?

09:33.990 --> 09:37.369
It says you'll pay me half of what
you earn for as long as you wear it.

09:37.660 --> 09:41.210
And then when you're done,
you have to return it to me.

09:41.873 --> 09:42.920
I'm gonna win, right?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.176
Of course.

10:09.859 --> 10:10.860
When do I get it?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.867
I'll have something
for you tomorrow.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.707
All right.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.116
I see what you're doing.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.498
Obviously in self-defense.

11:02.537 --> 11:03.709
The hell do you want?

11:04.914 --> 11:06.131
Your face.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.009
Get lost, old man.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.889
Hi.
Hi.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.597
How's Kelly?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.273
Good, just got him down.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.353
So, where have you been? I thought
you'd be home before now.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.855
Oh, I had to go to
the precinct first.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.189
Oh.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.615
So, how was Germany?
Did you find anything?

12:57.694 --> 13:00.664
Well, we think we found
where it was buried.

13:00.738 --> 13:04.914
Whatever it is, we just found a
bunch of bones in a catacomb.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.662
So, you didn't
find out what it was?

13:07.745 --> 13:09.042
No.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.166
Well, I'm glad you're home.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.375
Yeah.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.088
You hungry?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.047
Uh, no, just tired.

13:20.717 --> 13:25.018
Hey, uh, while you were
gone, I was thinking.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.315
That stuff we made for me
was just a suppressant.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.391
Yeah, I know.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.727
So, what happens
when it wears off?

13:31.686 --> 13:33.233
If you become
a Hexenbiest again?

13:33.604 --> 13:35.823
Yeah, how would
you feel about that?

13:35.898 --> 13:38.276
We just never talked
about that before.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.574
I don't know.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.405
I mean, we have Kelly
to think about now.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.568
What are you worried about?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.868
That you'll throw us out.
Or kill me.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.416
Oh, I could say
the same thing about you.

13:50.747 --> 13:54.297
Look,
if and when that happens,

13:54.375 --> 13:55.718
we'll just deal with it.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.421
I mean, you're not what you
used to be, and we have a son.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.881
Yeah.

13:59.964 --> 14:03.844
I don't wanna talk about
this anymore. Let's just go to bed.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.167
Somebody shot him!

14:36.250 --> 14:37.376
Hey!

14:38.044 --> 14:39.341
Oh, my God!

15:00.691 --> 15:03.535
ID'd the vic.
Name is Patrick Defonte.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.870
Witnesses??
Not yet.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.038
Who found him?

15:06.114 --> 15:08.663
Mr. Leonard,
lives across the street.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.085
On his way home from work, he took
a shortcut through the alley,

15:11.160 --> 15:12.377
found him like this.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.591
Apparently, someone knew
what they were doing.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.919
They removed the skin
with surgical precision.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.002
You thinking doctor?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.759
Of the Frankenstein variety.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.591
Looks like he took
his face off in one piece.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.348
This takes a facelift
to a whole other place.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.609
Is it ready? You have it?

15:35.685 --> 15:37.813
Yes. I worked all night.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.362
I haven't created
a mask like this for years.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.787
I think you'll have much
success with this one.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.036
Oh...

15:55.913 --> 15:58.041
I've never seen
anything more beautiful.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.047
Are you sure this is
what you want to do?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.260
Oh, yeah.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.171
I wanna try it on.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.434
It's perfect.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.307
Tell me how it feels.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.068
WOW.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.788
This is amazing.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.497
It feels different.

16:30.656 --> 16:31.748
Take it off.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.914
Already?
Yes.

16:37.455 --> 16:40.004
This mask should never again
be worn outside the ring.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.216
It has accepted you.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.010
Now, you must respect
its power.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.231
Hey.
Thank you.

17:29.840 --> 17:30.966
Juliette?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.473
Nick would have
told you by now.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.605
Eve.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.476
I understand you're
working with Meisner now.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.569
We didn't see it.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.862
See what?

17:43.938 --> 17:46.361
That he was gonna
be assassinated.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.201
Yeah, well,
no one saw that coming.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.745
We should have.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.039
You wanted him to be mayor,
you supported him.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.249
Why?

18:00.496 --> 18:01.668
He was a good man.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.666
Somebody asked you to.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.006
His team.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.346
Wait. We're done?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.515
For now.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.470
You know, there's a lot
more we could talk about.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.725
Right now, that's all I need.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.277
Looks like flayed faces are
not that unusual.

18:23.352 --> 18:26.231
Victims have been found in other
cities, going back a long way.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.691
Any more in Portland?
Two.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.323
Neither solved. One goes back
seven years, the other 12.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.038
So, either we have
a very methodic serial killer

18:34.113 --> 18:35.353
or they're not
connected at all.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.866
Got anything on
Patrick Defonte?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.166
Originally from Idaho,

18:38.242 --> 18:40.495
looks like he came
to Portland here about 1999

18:40.578 --> 18:42.058
when he got
his driver's license here.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.291
A couple of misdemeanors, drunk
and disorderly, and assault.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.960
He was pretty active.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.591
Well, apparently he was
at the Rainbow Bar

18:49.670 --> 18:51.297
just down the street
from where his body was found.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.132
M.E. completed
Patrick's autopsy.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.967
He had a lot of
alcohol in his system.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.303
Three times the legal limit.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.385
So he was tanked.

18:57.428 --> 18:59.476
But he died
from asphyxiation.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.525
They found neurotoxic
venom in his system,

19:02.933 --> 19:05.812
which caused paralysis, inhibiting
his diaphragm from contracting.

19:05.895 --> 19:06.896
How did that happen?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.322
M.E. has no clue.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.115
But the report suggests

19:10.191 --> 19:14.412
the skin of the victim's face was
removed while he was still alive.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.832
You remember the case we handled
with the alien sightings?

19:18.908 --> 19:20.080
Yeah.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.878
The missing cow ovary mystery.
Never figured that one out.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.672
Well, actually, we did.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.126
Missing cow ovaries?
Where was I?

19:28.209 --> 19:29.802
Vacation.
What now?

19:29.877 --> 19:33.256
Yeah, I can't explain how the victim
had neurotoxins in his system.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.341
But maybe he's Wesen?

19:35.424 --> 19:38.303
So, we think the murderer is one of
these taxidermist Wesen hunters?

19:38.386 --> 19:40.059
Wouldn't be our first.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.231
Let's run it by Monroe
and Rosalee.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.915
If they found
neurotoxins in the victim,

20:48.998 --> 20:50.750
you might be dealing
with something else.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.005
Like what?

20:52.293 --> 20:53.385
Konigschlange.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.135
But there's lots of Wesen
with neurotoxic capabilities.

20:56.714 --> 20:57.806
What do you know
about the victim?

20:57.882 --> 20:59.429
Someone took his face.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.012
Come again?
Surgically removed it.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.017
We think the attacker
has got to be Wesen.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.608
How will we explain the neurotoxins
injected into the victim?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.856
I brought you a couple of
photos of the victim.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.148
Before and after.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.440
MONROE; Oh.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.116
Oh, my God!
I know, it's awful.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.914
No, I know this guy!
Patrick somebody.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.538
He did construction on the old Telegram
Building during the renovation

21:24.617 --> 21:26.790
when I was working
on the clock tower.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.122
I saw him at the job site
a bunch of times.

21:29.205 --> 21:30.297
He's kind of a jerk.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.794
Was he Wesen?
Oh, yeah.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.417
Balam.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.879
He got in my face a couple of
times until I Blutbaded him.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.429
Then he kept his distance.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.136
So the attacker is Wesen
and so is the victim.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.552
Oh. Xipe Totec?

21:42.968 --> 21:44.345
Maybe.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.897
Being left
in the dark here.

21:47.598 --> 21:50.693
"Xipe Totec,
worshiped by Aztec warriors,

21:50.768 --> 21:53.396
"was known to flay his victims
and wear their skin.

21:54.230 --> 21:57.575
"It was believed that in doing
so, he absorbed their power.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.280
"Warriors imitated Xipe Totec
and created skin masks

22:01.362 --> 22:03.831
"to help them gain strength
during battle.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.249
"This practice
has been adapted

22:05.324 --> 22:08.328
"into present day
by Santeria priests,

22:08.410 --> 22:11.755
"or Santeros, mostly
comprised of Vibora Dorada."

22:11.831 --> 22:13.504
Well, that would explain
the neurotoxins.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.961
'Cause they paralyze their
victims so the Wesen stay Woged.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.972
"The Santeria priest
flays the Wesen epidermis

22:20.047 --> 22:21.799
"and imbues the mask
with the ability

22:21.882 --> 22:24.180
"to transfer Wesen
attributes onto its owner

22:24.260 --> 22:27.104
"through the mask,
even Kehrseite."

22:27.930 --> 22:30.854
You know, I did some research on
Santeria potions a while ago.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.435
Thought it would be
good for business.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.522
And I met a couple of old-school
Santeros here in Portland.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.857
Well, do you think you could figure
out how it works or who did it?

22:37.940 --> 22:39.283
If they're still around.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.577
So a Kehrseite can
technically become a Wesen?

22:41.652 --> 22:43.199
In face only.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.319
Well,
if Patrick was Wesen,

22:44.321 --> 22:47.291
then this Vibora Dorada might be
trying to make his face into a mask.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.876
Yeah, we got to find
this guy.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.624
Here,
take a look at this.

22:53.956 --> 22:56.709
Well, well, well,
what do we have here?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.465
Glad to have you back,
buddy.

22:58.544 --> 23:01.468
I knew you wouldn't look
a gift luchador in the mouth.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.641
What?
Never mind.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.055
Hey, where's Kawama?

23:06.135 --> 23:07.887
Kawama's dead.

23:07.970 --> 23:11.065
From now on, Tigre Feroz.

23:11.140 --> 23:15.566
Hey, hey, hey! A little espaniol.
Yeah. Proud of you, buddy.

23:16.812 --> 23:17.813
Wow.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.652
Looks so real.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.994
Well,
get your El Tigre listo.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.493
You may be a loser,

23:32.286 --> 23:34.380
at least that mask
is a winner.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.169
We have
a new luchador with us.

23:39.710 --> 23:44.090
El Tigre Feroz.

23:54.850 --> 23:58.150
We all know he doesn't
stand a chance

23:58.687 --> 24:01.190
against the undefeated

24:01.857 --> 24:03.985
Mayordomo!

25:04.086 --> 25:06.714
You're supposed to
be following my lead.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.926
Not anymore. I'm doing what I
should've done a long time ago.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.678
Seems like Mayordomo got up
on the wrong side of the bed.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.139
Pero, no worries,
he'll make a comeback!

25:56.263 --> 26:01.360
Tigre!

26:14.823 --> 26:16.450
It worked.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.169
It worked.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.874
What the hell
is wrong with you?

26:23.957 --> 26:26.176
Nothing.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.380
I can't believe you did this.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.307
You.

26:32.341 --> 26:35.515
Can you believe
that idiot? Idiot?

26:36.178 --> 26:37.270
He's a genius!

26:37.346 --> 26:38.347
What?

26:38.430 --> 26:39.898
Did you hear that crowd?

26:39.973 --> 26:41.065
What are you saying?

26:41.183 --> 26:45.279
He totally pulverized your
culo, and they loved it!

26:45.354 --> 26:46.571
Can't you hear 'em?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.857
They're still going nuts.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.783
And you!

26:51.568 --> 26:53.866
Oh, I gotta hand it to you,
that was bold.

26:54.113 --> 26:58.163
And I would've killed you had the
crowd not loved every second of it!

26:58.826 --> 27:00.373
Are you serious?

27:00.702 --> 27:05.048
Tomorrow night,
you are the headliner.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.344
We're not
done here.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.183
Yeah.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.808
I did it!

27:20.514 --> 27:23.063
It's all happening.
I can't believe it.

27:23.934 --> 27:24.981
So you won?

27:25.227 --> 27:27.776
Won? I crushed him.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.732
Not that
I couldn't have anyway.

27:30.357 --> 27:31.825
I felt different.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.902
Like I had power.
Real power.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.571
You should
put that away now.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.039
There was nothing
that could stop me.

27:39.158 --> 27:41.206
I know.
Did you bring the money?

27:41.493 --> 27:42.790
Yeah.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.582
Half of what I made tonight.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.263
Just remember,

27:53.505 --> 27:55.382
never wear that mask
outside the ring.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.591
You already told me that.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.393
I'm telling you again.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.845
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.680
No, you don't know
what you're doing.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.310
As long as I have this,
I do.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.038
Hey. You screwed me.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.876
You lost. Live with it.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.501
Boy, I should beat you
senseless

28:27.581 --> 28:29.049
for that crap
you pulled today.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.549
Yeah. Do that, you'll be costing
the boss a lot of money.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.129
Go home.

28:35.088 --> 28:37.386
Yeah, you might get
to headline one match,

28:37.466 --> 28:39.434
but I'm gonna kill you
in that ring tomorrow.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.101
You ain't killing nobody.

28:44.097 --> 28:46.697
Did Benito make this for you to
give you a little confidence, huh?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.022
Make you feel like a big man?

28:48.477 --> 28:49.649
Give it back.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.608
What, are you powerless
without this ugly thing?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.235
El Tigre Feroz?

28:56.985 --> 28:58.783
on.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.706
You shouldn't have done that.

29:01.782 --> 29:04.626
You know what? Maybe we'll
have that match right now.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.960
You're gonna be El Tigre Nada.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.074
Anyone get a look
at the attacker?

30:09.099 --> 30:13.479
Negative. But I did ID the vic.
Turns out he's James Vasquez.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.564
His fans know him
as El Mayordomo.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.190
The luchador?

30:17.274 --> 30:19.242
As in Mexican wrestler?
Apparently.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.336
We found his car
parked down the street,

30:21.361 --> 30:23.159
but he doesn't live
anywhere around here.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.411
Gym bag inside with
his mask and costume.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.912
I wanna take
a look at that mask.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.958
Thanks.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.445
Looks like
it's made of leather.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.545
Not what
we're looking for.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.297
Let's see where he worked.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.123
This mask should
never again be worn outside the ring.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.806
Sorry I'm late.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.348
I gotta show you something.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.353
They love you.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.279
But I didn't
save Andrew's life.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.447
But you caught his killer.
Did I?

32:24.526 --> 32:26.153
Of course you did.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.739
And the newspapers say so,
so it must be true.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.452
Look, Dixon served a purpose
for a greater good.

32:33.535 --> 32:35.754
You killed him to further
your own agenda.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.416
Most agendas include death.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.967
There's more than
one life at stake here.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.136
You're doing
the right thing by joining us.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.804
No, I haven’t joined
anybody yet.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.557
To win, we think
you'll need to have a family.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.556
Are you proposing?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.432
Or are you pregnant?

32:52.846 --> 32:54.439
No. And no.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.060
You don't need me for that.
You already have a daughter.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.069
How do you know about that?

33:00.562 --> 33:02.656
And Adalind's the mother.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.501
I can't believe
Mayordomo's dead.

33:15.577 --> 33:16.777
Did he have any enemies?

33:16.828 --> 33:19.172
Yeah,
I'm sure he had lots.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.874
I didn't pay any attention.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.881
I don't get involved in their
personal lives if I can avoid it.

33:23.960 --> 33:27.180
They're a mess.
May he rest in peace.

33:27.422 --> 33:30.050
You know, it would be helpful
if you had a few names for us.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.516
Well, yeah, I think he got into
it pretty good tonight with Goyo,

33:33.595 --> 33:35.268
but, yeah, you know,
nothing out of the ordinary.

33:35.347 --> 33:36.348
What happened?

33:36.431 --> 33:38.775
Well, Goyo beat his ass
in the ring tonight

33:38.850 --> 33:40.727
and Mayordomo wasn't
happy about it.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.071
Doesn't that
happen every fight?

33:43.146 --> 33:44.648
Well, no.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.575
No, you see, these fights have
a certain context to them.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.449
Good guy, bad guy.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.748
Mayordomo doesn't usually lose.
He's not supposed to.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.120
But tonight, he lost.

33:55.325 --> 33:56.702
In a pretty spectacular way.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.833
So, yeah, Mayordomo's
pretty upset with Goyo.

33:59.412 --> 34:02.791
Goyo, he was struttin' around real
good in that new mask tonight.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.335
New mask? What kind of mask?

34:04.417 --> 34:05.589
Oh, it was beautiful.

34:05.669 --> 34:09.047
Called himself
El Tigre Feroz.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.677
Kind of a black tiger.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.054
You know who made the mask?

34:12.132 --> 34:13.385
Well, uh...

34:13.467 --> 34:16.312
Yeah, I think he goes to Benito.
Most of the guys do.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.473
Do you have an address
for Goyo and Benito?

34:18.556 --> 34:20.525
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
I'll go get 'em for you.

34:25.146 --> 34:26.147
Rosalee.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.574
Hey, Nick,
I found one of the Santeros.

34:28.650 --> 34:32.871
This guy told her something really
super scary about these masks.

34:32.946 --> 34:33.946
What's that?

34:33.989 --> 34:35.866
He said these masks
are incredibly powerful.

34:35.949 --> 34:39.078
If you're not careful how you use
them, you will lose your mind.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.456
Is there any way to stop it?

34:40.536 --> 34:43.255
There's a few options. I mean,
there's a ceremony for everything.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.250
Thank you.

35:08.189 --> 35:11.033
It won't come off!
It won't come off!

35:11.526 --> 35:14.655
I warned you not to wear
that mask outside the ring.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.661
Get it off me! Get it off!

35:16.740 --> 35:18.868
What have you done?
Ah!

35:22.078 --> 35:23.295
Cut it off, burn it off!

35:23.371 --> 35:25.248
Do whatever you have to do!
Just get it off me!

35:25.332 --> 35:26.584
I told you.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.670
It can only be removed with
the Ceremonia de Desgracias!

35:30.211 --> 35:32.930
I don't care. Just do it!

35:33.882 --> 35:35.475
Imbecile.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.899
Is that
what you want? Don't let him.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.776
You'll lose it forever.

35:51.066 --> 35:54.570
You have to stop him.
He will destroy you.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.708
Don't listen to the mask,
Goyo.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.502
It's me.
I'm trying to help you.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.379
You sure this is
the right address?

36:12.462 --> 36:14.214
Yeah. Looks like.

36:43.952 --> 36:45.295
I can't get the mask
off him.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.338
We can't take him to
the precinct like this.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.751
The only way to
save him is...

36:50.834 --> 36:51.881
How?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.837
The Ceremonia de Desgracias.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.560
I mean, then, of course,
there's Moses and Aaron,

37:04.639 --> 37:07.267
their rods and staffs had
various miraculous powers

37:07.350 --> 37:08.727
during the plagues of Egypt.

37:08.810 --> 37:10.232
You know, in the book of Exodus.
The...

37:10.311 --> 37:13.861
And God commanded Moses to part
the Red Sea, yada yada yada.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.526
"Yada yada yada"?

37:18.153 --> 37:20.121
That's Aramaic,
if I'm not mistaken.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.243
Actually, it is.

37:21.322 --> 37:22.995
Wow, that was good.
Yeah.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.917
I didn't know you knew that.
I'm fluent.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.586
I know now.

37:26.661 --> 37:27.833
Nick, what's up?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.789
We got a problem.

37:29.873 --> 37:31.090
Are you okay?

37:31.166 --> 37:33.009
We found the Vibora Dorada.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.262
You caught the Vibora Dorada?

37:36.337 --> 37:38.135
Yeah, but that's not
the problem. He's dead.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.592
It's the guy with the mask.
We can't get it off his face.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.599
Ooh. Jeepers creepers,
that doesn't sound good.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.555
You said there's a ceremony
for everything.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.857
You ever hear of
the Ceremonia de Desgracias?

37:47.932 --> 37:50.731
Actually, I have, it's one of the
ones the Santero told me about.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.608
I think that's the only way we're
gonna get the mask off him.

37:52.687 --> 37:53.984
This guy's too dangerous
to move.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.690
We can't risk
taking him any place!

37:55.774 --> 38:01.031
Well, then, I guess, text us the
address and we'll come to you.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.911
So much for making tea.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.497
Okay. Okay.
It's not crazy complicated.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.250
All right, first,
the elekes, beads.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.081
Then the cowrie shells,
the diloggun.

38:11.164 --> 38:12.290
Got 'em.

38:12.373 --> 38:18.096
And then we need the herbs,
Datura mete! and Datura stramonium.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.548
That this?
Yes.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.883
That that?
Yes.

38:21.716 --> 38:22.888
This.
Yes.

38:23.218 --> 38:24.515
Oh, I need that.

38:24.928 --> 38:26.350
At least we don't need
a chicken.

38:26.513 --> 38:28.390
- Okay.
- How's it going in there?

38:29.307 --> 38:31.526
- Okay. You ready?
- Can we bring him in?

38:31.601 --> 38:32.853
Ready.
Okay. Bring him in!

38:34.145 --> 38:36.739
Hold him down at
the center of the circle.

38:37.774 --> 38:39.742
I have to pour this
on his face.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.828
Okay.
Seriously?

38:50.203 --> 38:51.329
That's not boiling, is it?

38:51.412 --> 38:53.732
According to this, it's the
only way to get that thing off.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.838
Okay, here we go.
Hold him.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.591
I got him!

39:08.930 --> 39:09.977
Now what?

39:10.932 --> 39:12.809
I don't know, it's the first
time I've ever done this.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.235
Well, how do we know
if it works?

39:14.310 --> 39:17.530
Well, supposedly, the mask
is just gonna come off,

39:17.605 --> 39:19.152
and be released
from the possessed

39:19.232 --> 39:21.735
and return to
its natural form, I think.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.162
What if it takes,
like, hours?

39:25.113 --> 39:26.239
It won't.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.074
Okay, there is a chant.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.785
I'm not that good at Spanish,
but here it goes.

39:38.585 --> 39:39.962
I think it's working.
Keep going.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.696
Is he alive?
Yeah. He's breathing.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.666
What happened?

40:15.622 --> 40:17.169
Who are you?

40:18.124 --> 40:19.216
Where's Benito?

40:19.292 --> 40:20.339
Benito's dead.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.432
Oh, my God. No.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.478
No, no.
Do you remember anything?

40:32.513 --> 40:33.605
I didn't mean to.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.809
It was the mask.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.102
I tried to take it off,
but it wouldn't come off.

40:38.186 --> 40:39.813
He's not the only one
you killed.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.238
What?

40:42.899 --> 40:44.572
Mayordomo.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.653
No, please,
you have to believe me.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.205
The mask told me to do it.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.824
They're trying to protect me.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.452
- Don't let him do it.
- The voices! The voices.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.128
They were protecting me.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.502
The voices.

40:58.581 --> 40:59.707
You hear them, don't you?

41:00.458 --> 41:03.257
Goyo, you need me!

41:04.420 --> 41:06.388
Oh, get it away from me!
Get it away!

41:07.298 --> 41:08.720
Get it away!

41:14.514 --> 41:16.733
Wow.
Oh, my God.

41:17.183 --> 41:18.435
It's Patrick.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.528
Well, now we can put
a face to the name.

41:22.105 --> 41:24.358
By the time he
realized the mask had possessed him,

41:24.440 --> 41:25.908
it was too late.

41:26.234 --> 41:29.363
The face of the Wesen proved more
powerful than the man beneath it.

41:30.738 --> 41:33.161
And I discovered the only
way to remove the mask

41:33.241 --> 41:35.289
was through
the Ceremonia de Desgracias,

41:35.576 --> 41:40.582
a brutal and painful process to reverse
the work of the Vibora Dorada.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.093
But even though
this was successful,

41:44.502 --> 41:47.972
I believe when subjected to multiple
personalities at the same time,

41:48.506 --> 41:50.429
the human mind
has only one escape,

41:51.134 --> 41:53.011
to go completely mad.

41:57.598 --> 41:59.646
- Hello?
- Hello, Adalind.

41:59.726 --> 42:00.726
Sean?

42:00.768 --> 42:01.769
It's been a long time.

42:02.228 --> 42:03.605
What do you want?

42:05.398 --> 42:07.025
Something that you want, too.

42:07.108 --> 42:08.655
Don't play games, Sean.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.830
I think I know
a way to get back Diana.
