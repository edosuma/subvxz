00:04.771 --> 00:06.534
Does everybody know what time it is?

00:06.606 --> 00:08.574
<i>- Tool Time!
- That's right.</i>

00:08.675 --> 00:12.304
Binford Tools is proud to present
Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!

00:12.379 --> 00:14.347
[cheering]

00:17.217 --> 00:18.548
Thank you.

00:19.619 --> 00:20.779
Thank you, everybody.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.856
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.</i>

00:23.923 --> 00:26.585
Of course, you all know my assistant,
Al Borland.

00:26.659 --> 00:28.957
[cheering]

00:30.130 --> 00:31.654
Thank you.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.926
Well, it's autumn
and we all know what that means.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.597
The days grow shorter
and Al grows wider.

00:41.474 --> 00:45.501
Autumn leaves are falling off the trees
and that means more work in your yard.

00:45.578 --> 00:49.446
l don't know about you, but when
l was a kid, raking leaves, worst job.

00:49.516 --> 00:52.212
Every Saturday, my mom:
''Get out there and rake leaves.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.253
And get your brother out of that bag!''

00:55.522 --> 00:59.014
The only fun we had when l was a kid was
you'd be able to burn them in big piles.

00:59.092 --> 01:01.856
We can't do that now,
it's not good for the environment.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.793
- Not at all.
- But there are fine tools

01:03.863 --> 01:06.388
that can help you clean up leaves
more effectively.

01:06.466 --> 01:08.229
- Let's look at some of them.
- OK.

01:08.334 --> 01:12.430
Here we've got the Binford 61 00
hand-held electric blower.

01:12.505 --> 01:16.168
That's a lot of fun, blowing the leaves
in your neighbor's yard.

01:16.242 --> 01:19.609
But if he catches you,
you still gotta put them in a bag.

01:19.712 --> 01:24.081
Well, then what we have here
is the 61 00 Mulch 'n Vac.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.711
This will vacuum your leaves
and mulch them at the same time.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.955
- [turns machine off]
- As nice as that machine is,

01:36.029 --> 01:39.863
- you know what l've always wondered?
- Why everybody likes Al?

01:43.470 --> 01:44.630
No.

01:44.704 --> 01:46.535
Why you can't use the same technology,

01:46.606 --> 01:50.667
but instead of sucking them
off the ground, suck them off the trees.

01:52.512 --> 01:55.413
Well, as long as you keep wondering,
no one will get hurt.

01:56.749 --> 02:00.116
You'd think by now
you'd know me better than that.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.710
You're right.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.815
Heidi, bring out whatever
ridiculous thing Tim souped up today.

02:05.892 --> 02:07.860
[Tim] Bring it out, Heidi.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.559
Here you go, Tim.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.259
Thank you, Heidi.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.428
lt's amazing what you can build
with a Binford blower,

02:17.504 --> 02:20.667
an old VW motor
and a surplus weather balloon.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.402
- Have you tested this?
- This will be the first time.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.654 --> 02:36.622
Well, it works.
Nobody got hurt.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.589
Let's give Tim a big hand.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.319
[applause]

03:41.087 --> 03:43.612
[Brad] Wow. Look at all the stuff
in the refrigerator.

03:43.690 --> 03:46.250
Chicken, potato salad,
three different kinds of pie.

03:46.359 --> 03:47.986
Eat that and die.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.758
Why, did you make it?

03:52.832 --> 03:55.198
That food is for your aunts.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.736
- What do we get?
- You get to clean your rooms,

03:57.804 --> 03:59.897
so they have a decent place to stay.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.703
How come we get thrown out
of our rooms every time they come?

04:02.775 --> 04:06.836
Well, you can bunk with your aunts
and watch them pluck facial hair.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.577
Why can't they just shave like Grandma?

04:11.651 --> 04:12.913
You're not old enough.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.352
You know Grandma still uses
a straight edge?

04:16.656 --> 04:19.523
- What are we doing?
- Talking about sleeping arrangements.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.149
l get her.

04:22.028 --> 04:25.259
- Sleeping arrangements for the weekend.
- We'll have a lot of fun.

04:25.331 --> 04:29.097
The Taylor men sleeping outside,
barbequing every meal.

04:29.168 --> 04:32.535
We'll test Binford's new Outdoor
Adventure series camping equipment.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.334
lt'll be a great time, guys.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.932
- Aren't we gonna freeze?
- The weak ones will.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.835
We got Binford's new
thermal-lined sleeping bags.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.177
We're gonna have a lot of fun, guys.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.615
l'm really excited
about my sisters coming.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.785
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.152
That's why you are sleeping outside?

04:51.424 --> 04:54.154
l'm sleeping outside
so the boys and l stay out of your way

04:54.227 --> 04:57.719
while you guys plan this 50th
anniversary party for your parents.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.960
- Your sisters are great.
- Yeah, they are.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.299
lf you like whacked-out, self-absorbed,
neurotic women.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.996
Which l do!

05:09.008 --> 05:12.239
Well, they are kind of neurotic,
especially when they argue.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.246
Robin doesn't argue.
She's the fun one.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.249
- Robin's not coming.
- She's also the smart one.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.009
- You suppose it's too late to cancel?
- l'm kidding.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.317
- lt'll be great. Don't worry.
- lt will.

05:23.389 --> 05:26.483
l'll just do what l always do.
l'll be the sensible, positive one

05:26.559 --> 05:29.255
- who keeps it from falling apart.
- Know what you need?

05:29.329 --> 05:32.025
- A stiff drink.
- That...

05:32.098 --> 05:33.827
...and a battle plan.
A battle plan!

05:33.900 --> 05:35.595
- A battle plan.
- No, listen.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.035
You're from a military family.
You gotta take control. Be forceful.

05:39.138 --> 05:42.266
lf they get out of line
you have them drop and do 20.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.774
l could be forceful. After all,
l am a colonel's daughter.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.609
That's the attitude. Be forceful.
Take command.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.343
- OK. Tim.
- All right. Yeah?

05:51.417 --> 05:54.181
l want you to have this area
vacuumed by 1 800 hours.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.393
- What do you guys think?
- Wow. This tent is huge.

06:02.261 --> 06:03.694
Even when you're roughing it

06:03.763 --> 06:06.664
you gotta leave room
for some of your basic comforts.

06:08.267 --> 06:11.498
Dad, you got a TV
and an Oriental rug in here.

06:13.139 --> 06:14.834
You got everything but a bathroom.

06:14.907 --> 06:16.374
<i>Au contraire.</i>

06:18.444 --> 06:20.912
Say hello to the throne away from home.

06:23.483 --> 06:26.008
<i>Binford's little camper amigo.</i>

06:26.085 --> 06:28.212
Comes fully equipped
with a changeable bag.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.586
l think l'll say hello to real plumbing
one last time.

06:33.860 --> 06:37.159
Wait a minute. Randy, come back here.
Your aunts are here.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.461
- There here!
- Hello, here he is!

06:40.533 --> 06:42.501
Look at you.
Oh, l can't believe it.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.132
He's a dead man.

06:47.206 --> 06:50.972
- Where is he? l can't see him?
- [Tim] They're nightmares.

06:51.043 --> 06:53.136
They've swallowed him whole.

06:53.212 --> 06:56.443
- [door opens]
- Come on, say hello.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.848
- [Mark whines]
- l'll be right behind you.

07:00.953 --> 07:03.444
Aw, not Mark!

07:03.523 --> 07:06.549
- How can it be?
- [kissing]

07:08.394 --> 07:10.919
No! Uh, uh, uh, uh. Wait.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.931
We're not gonna let you get away.

07:12.999 --> 07:14.899
[kissing]

07:14.967 --> 07:16.059
Where's Tim?

07:26.579 --> 07:30.345
- What is that?
- lt's supposed to repel mosquitoes.

07:30.416 --> 07:32.782
l hope it also repels aunts.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.945
Come here, you.

07:36.022 --> 07:39.583
lf you want to keep me away you should
have gone with a welding mask.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.126
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.354
Skinny.

07:45.898 --> 07:49.356
l can't believe l bought this fattening
food and everybody's on a diet.

07:49.435 --> 07:50.902
Linda, you look fantastic.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.336
How much weight have you lost
since the divorce?

07:53.406 --> 07:54.964
Two hundred pounds.

07:56.175 --> 07:58.541
'Course, 1 70 of that was husband.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.480
No, really, how did you lose
all the weight?

08:03.549 --> 08:05.813
l went to this psychic nutritionist.

08:05.885 --> 08:08.445
She told me something
that changed my life.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.251
- What did she say?
- ''Linda, you're too damn fat.''

08:13.159 --> 08:15.650
Psychics are just a little kooky for me.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.696
l weigh my food.

08:17.763 --> 08:20.288
Oh, ho. Well, this is good.

08:20.366 --> 08:22.527
Now that we've settled
all the food issues,

08:22.602 --> 08:26.163
we can scarf down the salads
and get to work on planning this party.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.003
l'm gonna share
the chicken Caesar with Jill.

08:29.075 --> 08:32.442
- Who's sharing my Cobb salad?
- l forgot to order that.

08:33.379 --> 08:36.542
Typical.
Everybody always forgets about Carrie.

08:36.616 --> 08:39.346
You did the same thing
at the cottage last summer.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.784
You were at the cottage last summer?

08:43.121 --> 08:45.022
Come on, come on.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.161
[sizzling]

08:50.930 --> 08:53.899
Wow. That's the biggest
piece of meat l've ever seen.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.833
Yeah? You haven't seen my piece yet.
Hold on.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.807
- You're gonna eat that whole thing?
- Yeah.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.607
We're gonna need a bigger bag
for the throne.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.447
All right. Let's start off
by talking about the centerpieces.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.853
Oh! l know what Mom and Dad
would simply love.

09:18.524 --> 09:21.459
- Tulips.
- Tulips. Fabulous idea.

09:21.527 --> 09:23.757
No, not according to my aromatherapist.

09:23.829 --> 09:25.854
She says they give off negative energy.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.097
You have an aromatherapist
and a psychic nutritionist?

09:31.170 --> 09:35.129
Uh-huh. Yeah. They're in the same
building as my cat's hypnotist.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.544
Carrie, what about the guest list?

09:38.611 --> 09:40.909
Yeah, l got it right here.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.813
There's a total of 1 25 people.

09:43.883 --> 09:48.752
That includes all of Mom's friends and
the one guy who's still talking to Dad.

09:50.022 --> 09:54.857
Now, wait a minute. There were only
supposed to be 1 20 people.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.656
l mean, it worked out perfectly.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.721
Ten tables of 1 2.

09:58.798 --> 10:02.632
OK. So now we'll have five tables of 1 2
and five tables of 1 3.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.329
- Perfect.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:04.403 --> 10:08.066
You cannot have 1 3 people
at a table for 1 2.

10:08.140 --> 10:11.007
You can if you believe you can.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.505
What is that supposed to mean?

10:15.581 --> 10:19.278
Well, l believe that we should talk
about something we can agree on.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.820
What about the photo album
we're making?

10:21.887 --> 10:24.014
- Sure.
- Anybody got any pictures?

10:24.090 --> 10:27.526
l found a picture of you
when you were a kid.

10:27.593 --> 10:32.087
Oh, look, here's one of me and Ted
on our wedding day.

10:34.266 --> 10:36.427
Here's another one of you and Ted.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.767
Linda, when did you have
dark curly hair?

10:39.872 --> 10:41.806
Never. Here, let me see that.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.866
Well, that's not me.

10:44.944 --> 10:47.242
That's Tracy sitting
on my husband's lap.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.378
What were you doing,
sitting on my husband's lap?

10:50.449 --> 10:53.282
Well, he's not your husband anymore.

10:53.352 --> 10:57.914
And he wasn't your husband
when l was dating him.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.419
So, you see.
lt all worked out.

11:03.863 --> 11:07.230
Oh, well. Were you dating him
while l was dating him?

11:07.299 --> 11:09.130
What's the difference?

11:09.201 --> 11:11.965
Yeah, it was a long time ago.
lt was only, what, a few times?

11:12.071 --> 11:14.972
Wait a second. You knew about this?
Hold on, excuse me.

11:15.041 --> 11:18.772
How come everyone knew
that Tracy was dating Ted except me?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.870
l didn't know,
but nobody ever tells Carrie anything.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.243
Jill, if you knew about this
why didn't you tell me?

11:25.317 --> 11:29.253
Because Tracy swore me to secrecy,
and you know how l am with secrets.

11:29.321 --> 11:32.449
Once it goes in the vault
it never comes out.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.686
Hey, guys, l need some meat tenderizer.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.627
Say, how's the party planning going?

11:37.697 --> 11:39.358
Well, you know, l don't know.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.992
l just found out
that Tracy was dating Ted.

11:42.068 --> 11:45.560
Oh, yeah. Remember when you guys went
to the Portuguese restaurant?

11:47.039 --> 11:50.372
He had the shellfish.
He was sick for a week. Remember that?

11:51.510 --> 11:54.638
- Who told you about it?
- Big blabbermouth.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.883
[Tim snoring]

12:08.828 --> 12:10.659
[snoring]

12:20.239 --> 12:22.901
How can so much noise
come out of one nose?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.439
- [snoring]
- [Mark] Maybe if we close it.

12:28.214 --> 12:30.739
No, then the noise would
just come out of his mouth.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.484
What if we close his nose
and his mouth?

12:34.587 --> 12:37.078
l think that's called murder.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.481
[snoring]

12:41.527 --> 12:44.052
l could hear him
from all the way upstairs.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.899
- Scary, isn't it?
- How do you live with it?

12:47.967 --> 12:49.901
[sighing] Watch and learn.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.801
- We'll be back after these messages.
- Tim, Tim!

12:57.243 --> 12:58.801
- Honey, honey.
- What? What!

12:58.878 --> 13:00.812
- l need to talk to you.
- Oh.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.212
Can you do it outside
so we can get some sleep?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.944
Yeah.
Why did you have to wake up the boys?

13:10.656 --> 13:12.624
Tim, this is a disaster.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.421
We haven't done one thing
about Mom and Dad's party.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.588
lf l don't get them to stop fighting
it's never gonna happen.

13:18.664 --> 13:19.790
OK, OK.

13:20.199 --> 13:22.633
You do what l do
to stop my brothers from fighting.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.169
- What's that?
- Crack open a six pack,

13:26.338 --> 13:28.101
roll up a wet towel,

13:28.207 --> 13:31.370
and snap each other on the butt
raising a welt you can be proud of.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.470
l don't think that's gonna work
on my sisters.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.709
Too bad.
They got some great targets.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.645
- Tim.
- All right, all right.

13:40.719 --> 13:43.415
You gotta lay down the law
with these girls, all right?

13:43.489 --> 13:44.820
lt's our house.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.487
You tell them nobody's
allowed to fight in this house.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.029
Except you and me.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.530
All right.
l'm gonna give 'em one last chance.

13:53.599 --> 13:57.160
And if any of them give me any lip,
l'm gonna tell Mommy and Daddy.

14:00.573 --> 14:04.304
Now, l want you all
to just forget about last night.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.375
This is a brand new day.

14:06.445 --> 14:09.812
We're gonna put aside our differences
and think about Mom and Dad.

14:09.915 --> 14:13.874
Now, l want to begin with a group hug.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.715
- Aw, OK.
- Come on.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.551
- Come on.
- OK.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.716
- [Carrie clears throat]
- Oh.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.423
lsn't this nice?
We're bonding.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.936
Oh, good. l got something
that will bond to your ribs.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.369
l cooked your breakfast.

14:33.439 --> 14:36.272
Belgian waffles,
six different kinds of breakfast meats.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.503
Thank you, Tim.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.511
You've been away
from animal products,

14:40.579 --> 14:42.877
but l think it's time to come home
to hot links.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.711
How do you eat those things?

14:46.785 --> 14:48.480
l like to wrap mine in bacon.

14:51.523 --> 14:55.482
A little Canadian bacon outside.
Pig-in-a-blanket wearing a parka.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.994
Don't load up.
l got a surprise for you.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.932
- OK, everybody, let's get to work.
- OK.

15:03.002 --> 15:06.961
Now, does anybody know a good place in
San Antonio where we can have a party?

15:07.039 --> 15:10.668
l know a wonderful place right around
the corner from me, Clancy's.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.803
Every chicken breast
is exactly 3.5 ounces.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.710
l don't even need to bring my scale.

15:15.781 --> 15:17.749
You know what?
l've got a better idea.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.681
The last time l was at the Riverwalk

15:19.752 --> 15:22.050
l found this great
new Korean restaurant.

15:22.121 --> 15:25.682
Oh, yeah. That ought to bring back
some nice war memories for Dad.

15:27.359 --> 15:28.986
OK, girls.

15:31.530 --> 15:33.020
Cajun patties.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.534
You'll love them.
[southern accent] l guarantee it.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.627
We have to make a decision.

15:38.704 --> 15:43.141
l say for the music we should go
with the Hank Pfefferman Five.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.644
- l love Hank Pfefferman.
- l hate Hank Pfefferman.

15:46.712 --> 15:49.272
You are saying that
because you know that l love him.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.908
- No, l'm not.
- Can't we agree about something?

15:52.818 --> 15:56.515
Four different kinds of hot sauce.
Say hello to your lower intestines.

15:59.091 --> 16:02.390
Why am l the only one who's never
heard of Hank Pfefferman?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.361
Thank your lucky stars. He stinks.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.455
Says who, your cat's piano teacher?

16:07.933 --> 16:10.868
How do you teach a cat
to play the piano?

16:12.671 --> 16:14.901
You can't.
Your idiot sister made that up.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.272
- Now l'm an idiot?
- You were always an idiot.

16:17.343 --> 16:21.211
- [all arguing]
- Stop it. Stop it!

16:21.280 --> 16:22.770
You are all insane.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.816
And l'm insane for listening to this.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.078
l'm sick of all this fighting.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.779
l'm sick of playing referee.

16:28.854 --> 16:32.085
When there is no party for Mom and Dad
you can tell them why.

16:32.624 --> 16:33.716
[Tim] Jill?

16:33.792 --> 16:35.851
Well, what's wrong with her?

16:35.928 --> 16:38.021
l don't know.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.462
She's always so sensible.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.728
You'd think she'd try
a little harder with family here.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.359
Excuse me. Excuse me.

16:45.838 --> 16:50.332
My wife has been up all night worrying
because you hens won't stop bickering.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.572
She drives herself nuts
and how do you thank her?

16:58.650 --> 17:00.345
Argue about a cat playing a piano

17:00.419 --> 17:02.148
and Hank Fahrvegnugen!

17:03.989 --> 17:05.684
You know what?
l'm sick of this too.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.921
From now on, you're no longer
welcome at my sausage bar.

17:17.669 --> 17:20.035
- Hi, Jill.
- Hi, Delores, how are you?

17:20.105 --> 17:21.265
l've been better.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.001
Some jerk just left me a four cent tip.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.704
- People can be so rude.
- The joke's on him.

17:26.779 --> 17:29.043
His veggie burger was made out of pork.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.382
What can l get for you?

17:32.451 --> 17:34.351
How about a cup of tea?

17:36.989 --> 17:39.355
[Wilson] Well, hi ho, Jill.

17:40.759 --> 17:42.249
Hi, Wilson, how are you?

17:42.327 --> 17:45.490
Well, l came over here to get away
from the flank steak fumes

17:45.564 --> 17:47.327
which are permeating my backyard.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.900
Here you go, Jill.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.127
Thank you.

17:50.235 --> 17:55.764
Oh, Delores, can l get a cup
of your superlative mocha java?

17:55.841 --> 17:57.934
Mocha java. Mr. Fancy!

17:58.010 --> 17:59.534
[Wilson chuckling]

18:00.112 --> 18:04.173
Oh, Jill, so what brings you over here
to the Copper Kettle?

18:04.249 --> 18:06.410
l've been driving around all morning.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.247
l blew up and stormed out
of my own house

18:09.321 --> 18:12.415
'cause l couldn't stand to be
around my sisters another minute.

18:12.491 --> 18:13.924
l think you can go home now.

18:13.992 --> 18:18.224
As l was leaving the house
l saw them pulling away in a cab.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.725
Great.

18:20.799 --> 18:24.565
We're supposed to be planning this very
important event in my parents' lives

18:24.670 --> 18:25.637
and my sisters bail.

18:25.737 --> 18:28.228
l don't know why l'm surprised.
They get to be crazy.

18:28.307 --> 18:29.831
l have to be the sensible one.

18:29.908 --> 18:32.001
Well, it can be quite a burden.

18:32.077 --> 18:35.137
Know what it's like to have
everybody come with their problems,

18:35.214 --> 18:36.681
and expect you to solve them?

18:43.355 --> 18:45.323
You know, Jill,
l realize it isn't easy.

18:45.390 --> 18:48.291
A lot of people think it's a picnic
for me to stand by the fence

18:48.360 --> 18:50.828
and offer up a quotation
for every situation.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.027
l mean, what am l, a library?

18:54.099 --> 18:57.796
Here we go.
For Mr. Fancy a cup of our finest.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.201
[Wilson chuckling]

19:01.974 --> 19:06.240
- Good.
- Well, the crazy people have it easy.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.802
l mean, they don't care
what people think.

19:09.581 --> 19:12.550
They lose control,
they say whatever pops into their heads.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.085
- [Wilson] Mmm.
- Yeah.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.644
lt's us sensible people who suffer.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.781
So, we have to learn to fight back.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.119
How?

19:20.192 --> 19:21.659
By doing what you did today.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.188
- What did l do?
- You lost control.

19:25.264 --> 19:27.732
You said the first thing
that popped into your head

19:27.799 --> 19:30.324
and you didn't care
what anybody thought.

19:30.402 --> 19:32.131
Congratulations, Jill.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.138
You are a nut.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.245
- l am, aren't l?
- Oh, certifiable.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.279
Thank you, Wilson.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.885
Hey, Dad, here's a perfect picture
for the cover of the album,

19:46.952 --> 19:48.920
Grandma and Grandpa
on their wedding day.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.717
That's your mother and me.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.190
Oh, yeah. The church is on fire.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.058
- [Tim] Hi.
- Hi, guys.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.396
- [Randy] Hi, Mom.
- l feel a lot better.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.628
l'm ready to start planning the party.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.193
What are you doing?

20:06.271 --> 20:09.240
- Planning the party.
- Your photo album's almost done.

20:09.341 --> 20:10.569
And we booked the band.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.803
l talked to Hank's wife,
Faye Pfefferman.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.972
She drives the bus, the Pfeffermobile.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.814
l can't believe it.
You guys are so sweet.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.854
- Hi, we're back!
- [all] Hi!

20:22.955 --> 20:25.617
- l thought you went home.
- Home? No.

20:25.691 --> 20:28.455
We went to the florist
to get some prices and ideas.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.426
- ln a cab?
- You had the Nomad.

20:31.496 --> 20:33.259
They're not gonna fit in the Healey.

20:33.365 --> 20:37.028
And if you think l'm letting them take
my Mustang, l don't think so.

20:38.070 --> 20:42.336
Listen, Jill, after you left
Tim was kind enough to point out to us

20:42.407 --> 20:45.672
- we were behaving like idiots.
- l pointed that out.

20:45.744 --> 20:49.180
lt had a lot more impact
coming from a guy snapping a wet towel.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.210
Hey, is everybody ready
to plan this party?

20:53.285 --> 20:56.516
- Let's do it.
- We'll stay here as long as it takes.

20:58.156 --> 21:00.488
- l love you guys.
- [all] Oh!

21:03.495 --> 21:05.929
Well, l guess we know what this means.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.159
The meat fest continues.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.265
Wait. Wait a minute.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.735
l could marinate a skirt steak.
How about that?

21:12.804 --> 21:15.637
How about a pork barbeque?
Or pork bar?

21:15.707 --> 21:17.675
lt'll be ''hams across America''.

21:26.551 --> 21:28.109
[snoring]

21:35.227 --> 21:37.058
[snoring continues]

21:41.767 --> 21:42.995
[grunting]

21:43.068 --> 21:46.037
We'll be right back after
these messages from Binford Tools.

21:46.104 --> 21:49.073
<i>Honey. Honey, honey, wake up.
You're not on Tool Time.</i>

21:49.174 --> 21:53.042
Oh. lt's too bad.
lt was a great Gadget Corner.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.977
We made a machine that shaved Al's back.

21:58.016 --> 21:59.950
l have something l want to say to you.

22:00.018 --> 22:01.645
[Tim sighing]

22:01.720 --> 22:04.086
What you did today meant a lot to me.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.020
l know how much your sisters
mean to you.

22:06.091 --> 22:07.183
Yeah.

22:07.259 --> 22:09.887
l was afraid if l lost
my relationship with my sisters

22:09.961 --> 22:12.725
there would be a big
emotional void in my life.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.356
- Voids.
- But now l realize that there...

22:15.434 --> 22:17.197
...can never be a void,

22:17.302 --> 22:19.167
as long as l have you.

22:22.574 --> 22:23.802
[sighing]

22:23.875 --> 22:26.139
l just have one question.

22:26.211 --> 22:29.112
What am l doing
laying out here in the grass?
