00:01.120 --> 00:03.620
Gary: When someone you love
goes too soon...

00:03.620 --> 00:04.750
Jon, you say
everything happens for a reason.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.710
...you can't help
but wonder why.

00:06.710 --> 00:08.000
I can't find a reason for this.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.790
No!

00:09.790 --> 00:11.500
Tell me one good thing
that's happened because of this.

00:11.500 --> 00:12.330
One.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.920
But then, in a weird way...

00:14.920 --> 00:17.750
Sometimes,
I feel so hopeless!

00:17.750 --> 00:20.250
...their death reminds you
to celebrate life...

00:20.250 --> 00:21.500
I don't want to not live

00:21.500 --> 00:23.540
because I'm afraid
of not living.

00:23.540 --> 00:25.120
...even a new life...

00:25.120 --> 00:26.790
This is our baby.
Stop.

00:26.790 --> 00:27.960
...even when it's hard.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.960
I think we should
get a divorce.

00:30.960 --> 00:33.120
So you keep pushing forward...

00:33.120 --> 00:34.420
Is this
based on your life?

00:34.420 --> 00:35.540
I've had days like that.

00:35.540 --> 00:36.540
...to find hope...

00:36.540 --> 00:38.330
I'm looking for
Barbara Morgan.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.210
...where...

00:39.210 --> 00:40.000
Hey, Sophie!

00:40.000 --> 00:41.420
...you least expect it.

00:41.420 --> 00:43.460
Mom, there's somebody here
to see you.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.500
She's gone.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.000
Gary:

00:47.000 --> 00:48.250
All right.

00:48.250 --> 00:49.670
Tight corner.
Yep.

00:49.670 --> 00:50.960
There we go.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.250
Okay, another break,
another break.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.580
Ow!
Wow!
6 breaks for 10 stairs.

00:54.580 --> 00:55.580
You're my hero.

00:55.580 --> 00:56.920
My end is heavier.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.380
Really? 'Cause my end says
"Heavy end."

01:00.380 --> 01:01.540
You're a mean roommate.

01:01.540 --> 01:03.420
No, you are
a mean roommate.

01:03.420 --> 01:04.250
You're the one
who's kicking me out.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.250
I am not
kicking you out.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.420
I'm moving you
to your own place.

01:07.420 --> 01:08.380
My place!

01:08.380 --> 01:09.830
Oh, by the way,

01:09.830 --> 01:13.750
Janet across the hall,
who lives with her father?

01:13.750 --> 01:15.460
Not her father.
Wow.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.040
Most awkward elevator ride
of my life.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.460
Careful
with the floors, Ed.

01:18.460 --> 01:21.290
Ooh!
You got the dresser.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.580
Yeah, which we are
not putting together --

01:23.580 --> 01:26.380
Until she gets her all-clear.
I know. I know.

01:26.380 --> 01:27.620
I'm not gonna jinx it,

01:27.620 --> 01:29.540
but you are gonna get it
this afternoon.

01:29.540 --> 01:31.380
But I'm not gonna jinx it,
'cause I know.

01:31.380 --> 01:33.620
I know.
Not gonna jinx it.

01:33.620 --> 01:37.170
Wow. You know, he just had
a whole conversation by himself.

01:37.170 --> 01:38.750
Enjoy living here.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.420
Anyway...

01:40.420 --> 01:42.080
PJ, I was
just really checking in

01:42.080 --> 01:43.460
to see
how you were doing.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.670
Thanks, man. Better.

01:45.670 --> 01:49.620
I called that...
psychologist friend of yours --

01:49.620 --> 01:51.500
uh, Maggie.
Yeah.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.080
I'm supposed to meet with her
next week.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.620
Oh, man,
that's great.

01:54.620 --> 01:55.500
Thanks.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.540
Of course, PJ.

01:56.540 --> 01:57.920
You just let me know
how it goes, okay?

01:57.920 --> 01:59.210
I will.

01:59.210 --> 01:59.920
All right.
Bye, Rome.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.500
Okay, so, as you all know,

02:20.500 --> 02:23.500
this baby's gonna be here
in less than four weeks,

02:23.500 --> 02:25.460
and the kids and I
feel that it's time

02:25.460 --> 02:27.540
to give some of Jon's stuff
to charity.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.000
But...

02:29.000 --> 02:31.920
We want each of you
to have something of Dad's.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.830
Please be the house.
Please be the house.
Please be the house.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.380
Gary.
Yes?

02:36.380 --> 02:37.620
Dad always
bragged about --

02:37.620 --> 02:40.120
About going to
Harvard.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.790
And now you can, too.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.290
What?

02:44.290 --> 02:46.290
Oh, man.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.750
I love it.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.380
All the street cred,
none of the student loans.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.620
Suck on that, BC.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.210
Thank you.

02:55.210 --> 02:56.710
Gina.
Yeah!

02:56.710 --> 02:58.750
This was the first award

02:58.750 --> 03:00.620
for real estate
Jon ever received.

03:00.620 --> 03:02.420
Oh!

03:02.420 --> 03:03.420
Oh.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.580
"J-O-H-N."

03:04.580 --> 03:06.040
They spelled
his name wrong.

03:06.040 --> 03:07.750
He was so proud
of that.

03:07.750 --> 03:10.750
He said, "They don't know me
now, but they will."

03:10.750 --> 03:12.500
That's why
we want you to have it.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.540
Because Boston
is gonna know you, Gina!

03:15.790 --> 03:18.000
Yes, yes, yes!

03:18.000 --> 03:19.620
Before we forget --
Before we forget, do me.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.290
Rome...

03:25.290 --> 03:29.000
I bought these for Dad
for Father's Day,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.040
and...

03:31.040 --> 03:32.380
Oh, my --

03:32.380 --> 03:33.710
I can't.

03:33.710 --> 03:37.210
You've...just done so much
for me this year,

03:37.210 --> 03:39.540
so...

03:39.540 --> 03:41.500
I wanted you
to have them.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.620
Come here.

03:48.710 --> 03:50.040
Love you.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.580
Dan Dixon, would you
lighten the mood, please?

04:00.580 --> 04:02.000
On it!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.670
Edward.

04:03.670 --> 04:05.500
For you,
we wanted to give you

04:05.500 --> 04:07.790
Dad's most prized
hockey possession --

04:07.790 --> 04:11.670
that is not
Bruins-related.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.040
Oh, my God.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.040
He kept it!

04:14.040 --> 04:16.170
No way!
Yes way.

04:16.170 --> 04:17.540
What? H-Huh?
What's happening?

04:17.540 --> 04:19.080
Wh--
I want to laugh, too.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.250
Regina: Oh, well...
Sir.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.330
Thank you, my liege.
...in 2011,

04:21.330 --> 04:23.830
when the Bruins
went to the Stanley Cup,

04:23.830 --> 04:25.460
Jon got the guys tickets
to Game 7.

04:25.460 --> 04:26.500
Yes.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.790
The Bruins were playing --

04:27.790 --> 04:29.670
Maggie: Canucks, Vancouver.
It was a shutout.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.670
But the Blackhawks
are in Chicago and --

04:31.670 --> 04:34.420
Oh, my God, I have learned
way too much about hockey

04:34.420 --> 04:35.750
since we've been dating.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.420
So, Jon, he gets us
the tickets to the playoffs.

04:38.420 --> 04:40.500
Eddie here
handles the itinerary.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.580
It was a perfect trip,
and nothing went wrong.

04:43.580 --> 04:44.880
What?!
That seems legit.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.290
Oh!

04:47.290 --> 04:50.120
Last, but not least,
we have Maggie.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.170
Me?
You're gonna
get a thing.

04:52.170 --> 04:54.460
Why?
I didn't even know Jon.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.710
After everything this year,
don't you feel like you do?

04:57.710 --> 04:59.920
Which is why
we want to give you

04:59.920 --> 05:02.380
one of his
most cherished possessions.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.290
Please be the house.
Please be the house.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.790
A signed album
from Colin Hay.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.170
Are you serious?

05:10.170 --> 05:11.710
Ohh!
I love Men at Work!

05:11.710 --> 05:13.460
Come on!

05:13.460 --> 05:15.170
I love Men at W--
How come I didn't get that?

05:15.170 --> 05:16.500
Uh,
because you never work.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.250
Thanks for helping me.

05:21.250 --> 05:22.290
You shouldn't
be lifting.

05:22.290 --> 05:23.750
We're headed out,
so...

05:23.750 --> 05:26.420
We got to go test-drive cars,
'cause my lease is up.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.250
Ugh. Car dealerships
are the worst.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.710
Aww, yeah.

05:29.710 --> 05:32.580
I have to go to my doctor
to find out if my cancer's gone.

05:32.580 --> 05:34.580
Oh, and then I have to go home
to tell Theo

05:34.580 --> 05:36.500
that his mom and dad
are getting a divorce.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.120
Yeah, but good luck
at the dealership, man.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.540
We're all
pulling for you.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.500
Rome: Ha ha.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.290
Sophie: Hey, can somebody
come help us with these boxes?
Come on.

05:44.290 --> 05:48.290
D, I am so excited to be
in the room with you and you.

05:48.290 --> 05:50.580
I decided that I'm going to be
near your shoulders, though.

05:50.580 --> 05:51.830
Smart.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.500
All right.
Babe, are you ready?

05:53.500 --> 05:54.620
Baiser.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.710
Mwah!

05:56.710 --> 05:57.750
See you soon.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.920
Hmm.
Regina: See you later.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.330
Hey.

06:01.330 --> 06:03.120
I only asked Gina
to be in the delivery room

06:03.120 --> 06:04.290
because I c--
No. I --

06:04.290 --> 06:06.380
Hey, Regina is
the perfect choice.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.380
I am here --
whatever you need.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.880
Sophie:
Hey, Mom, come quick!

06:14.880 --> 06:16.330
What is it?

06:16.330 --> 06:18.540
I was showing Gary
the photo of that woman

06:18.540 --> 06:20.250
who came by the house.

06:20.250 --> 06:22.210
He knows her.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.880
Gary: She's younger
in that photo.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.500
But that's Barbara Morgan.

06:42.790 --> 06:43.790
D.

06:43.790 --> 06:45.380
D, that's her.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.620
She lives at the address
that Jon has for Barbara Morgan.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.620
Why else would that woman come
into your house and then leave?

06:49.620 --> 06:52.710
Why would she lie
about who she is?
I don't know.

06:52.710 --> 06:54.750
Well, let's go over there
and get some answers.

06:54.750 --> 06:55.830
I don't want
to go over there.

06:55.830 --> 06:57.420
Fine. I'll go.
No, I don't --

06:57.420 --> 06:58.790
I don't want you
to go over there.

06:58.790 --> 06:59.830
I need to move on.

06:59.830 --> 07:01.960
I need to get ready
for this baby.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.040
Don't you want to know
the truth?

07:04.040 --> 07:05.540
I don't know if I do.

07:07.210 --> 07:10.040
Nothing I'm gonna find out
is gonna bring Jon back.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.040
Mom.

07:22.210 --> 07:23.580
No, I'm happy
to test-drive.

07:23.580 --> 07:25.500
But you should get
what you want.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.540
And you don't just want
to get another Tesla?

07:27.540 --> 07:28.960
No.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.250
It's a lot of money, and I think
that we should be practical.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.170
Between your restaurant
and my writing,

07:33.170 --> 07:36.170
I think we need
to scale back.

07:36.170 --> 07:37.580
I guess
you're right.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.250
We should be asking ourselves
where we're gonna be

07:39.250 --> 07:40.330
in the next
three years.

07:40.330 --> 07:42.290
Yeah, or 36,000 miles,
whichever comes first.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.790
Mmm!

07:46.790 --> 07:48.710
But we can at least
test-drive, right?

07:50.120 --> 07:51.120
Excuse me, sir!

07:59.580 --> 08:01.040
You know, Mom...

08:03.250 --> 08:05.210
...maybe we should
go find her.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.920
It's just that...

08:11.920 --> 08:13.710
one day,

08:13.710 --> 08:18.170
my little brother or sister
is --

08:18.170 --> 08:22.040
is gonna come to me
and say...

08:22.040 --> 08:24.250
"What happened to Dad?
Why did he do this?"

08:27.380 --> 08:30.080
And I would like
to have an answer.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.670
I just...

08:36.250 --> 08:39.080
I feel like every time
we go searching for answers,

08:39.080 --> 08:41.290
all we get
are more questions.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.920
And right now, I...

08:46.920 --> 08:50.880
I can't -- I can't handle
any more questions.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.000
It's okay, Mom.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.080
You ready?

09:10.330 --> 09:13.420
Everything I've done
for the past eight years has...

09:13.420 --> 09:15.710
been about
protecting him.

09:15.710 --> 09:17.210
I know.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.500
But here's
what we're gonna do.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.960
We are gonna
go in there together,

09:23.960 --> 09:26.250
we are gonna
support each other,

09:26.250 --> 09:29.120
and we're gonna show him
the best version of us.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.920
But, Eddie.
Yeah?

09:37.040 --> 09:40.290
That's just it.

09:40.290 --> 09:42.960
This is
the best version of us.

09:44.170 --> 09:46.710
W-What are you saying?

09:46.710 --> 09:49.290
The last time you were here,
when we were signing the papers,

09:49.290 --> 09:52.040
we were talking
about everything.

09:52.040 --> 09:55.330
We were finally
acknowledging

09:55.330 --> 09:57.040
what we had done
to each other.

09:59.250 --> 10:03.040
If Theo hadn't come down
that night,

10:03.040 --> 10:04.580
you were gonna kiss me.

10:06.460 --> 10:08.500
And...

10:08.500 --> 10:12.040
I haven't stopped thinking
about that since you left.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.500
How can we not
try to save this?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.540
How c--

10:27.750 --> 10:31.040
W-What are we doing?

10:31.040 --> 10:34.290
I mean...
we're divorced.

10:34.290 --> 10:37.080
No, we're not.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.170
Uh, w--

10:38.170 --> 10:39.580
No,
we signed the papers.

10:39.580 --> 10:42.290
I...didn't file them.

10:42.290 --> 10:43.580
Y--

10:43.580 --> 10:46.080
Why didn't you tell me?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.420
I, uh --

10:48.420 --> 10:50.460
I was afraid.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.330
I was afraid to...

10:55.330 --> 10:58.080
want something
that you didn't want.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.170
Are you kidding me?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.500
Every time I drop Theo off,
every time I see you,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.750
every time
I walk out that door,

11:10.750 --> 11:13.170
I think,
"Where are you going?"

11:14.830 --> 11:16.080
"You're home."

11:18.960 --> 11:20.620
So come home.

11:24.830 --> 11:26.620
Oh, my God!

11:26.620 --> 11:28.790
I totally forgot.

11:28.790 --> 11:31.500
Uh --

11:31.500 --> 11:33.540
What's going on
in there?!

11:33.540 --> 11:35.380
Um,  I --
It's just the...

11:35.380 --> 11:36.330
...grilled cheese.

11:36.330 --> 11:37.540
I can --
I can make you another.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.250
Come home for dinner.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.250
I promise I won't burn it.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.620
But what --
what are we gonna tell him?

11:44.620 --> 11:45.830
I don't know.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.120
We will figure it out...

11:48.120 --> 11:50.250
together.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.670
Theo has a playdate,
I have work.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.790
So be here for dinner
at 6:00?

11:55.790 --> 11:57.460
I'll be here at 6:00.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.880
Hey.

12:13.330 --> 12:14.880
Look at me, Bloom.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.830
I'm gonna love you
forever.

12:25.830 --> 12:28.620
No matter how long
our forever is.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.880
Hello, you two.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.170
So, Maggie...

12:46.170 --> 12:48.420
I'm gonna make this quick.

12:48.420 --> 12:51.040
Your margins
came back clear.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.790
You're in remission.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.620
Oh, thank God.

13:05.380 --> 13:06.620
Why are you laughing?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.250
Ohhhh.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.580
Why are you --

13:09.580 --> 13:12.000
Why are we laughing?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.040
Ohhhhh.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.830
I'm sorry.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.000
What are you d--

13:17.000 --> 13:19.210
Why are w--

13:21.920 --> 13:23.580
I don't --

13:23.580 --> 13:26.080
Oh, God.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.750
Now, if you
validate parking, Doc,

13:27.750 --> 13:29.620
then you would make this
a perfect day.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.210
Uh, we don't validate.

13:33.210 --> 13:35.750
Aaaah!

13:37.330 --> 13:39.580
Oh, my God,
that was incredible.

13:39.580 --> 13:41.000
If I had hair,
it'd be everywhere right now.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.580
Whoo!

13:49.120 --> 13:50.380
I think
you should get it.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.920
I think
we should be practical.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.620
Babe, the restaurant
is doing great.

13:54.620 --> 13:57.330
And you have worked
so hard.

13:57.330 --> 13:59.330
Your script
is fantastic.

13:59.330 --> 14:01.000
It's pretty great.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.620
Let's bet on us.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.420
I want you to have
everything you want.

14:05.420 --> 14:09.620
You know, maybe if we can
negotiate a really good price.

14:09.620 --> 14:11.170
Oh, I can
negotiate anything.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.290
Yeah?

14:12.290 --> 14:13.920
You've seen me
at the farmer's market.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.460
I haven't paid for basil
since 2010.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.710
Salesman: You two, uh,
made a decision?

14:20.500 --> 14:23.120
Well...
depends on you.

14:24.170 --> 14:26.000
I'll be out here.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.830
Ta-daaa!

14:31.830 --> 14:35.580
Pay no attention
to the extra pieces-aaaaa!

14:36.580 --> 14:37.710
Wait.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.620
What do we have here?

14:40.620 --> 14:41.880
Oh, boy.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.790
Maggie Bloom's yearbook.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.620
Jackpot.

14:45.620 --> 14:49.040
There you are
playing field hockey.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.170
Which one of those boxes
is this kilt in? Huh?

14:52.170 --> 14:54.250
There you are.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.960
And there you are.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.120
There you are
in the cafeteria.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.380
How did you manage to make it
into all of these --

15:00.380 --> 15:02.330
Oh, and she was
on the yearbook committee.

15:02.330 --> 15:05.210
I've always thought that was was
a conflict of interest, no?

15:06.330 --> 15:07.330
Hey.

15:07.330 --> 15:09.290
Hey.

15:09.290 --> 15:11.460
What's going on
over there?

15:19.250 --> 15:22.000
I packed my entire life
into these boxes

15:22.000 --> 15:24.330
so that someone else
wouldn't have to.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.750
I just never thought
I'd be the one to unpack them.

15:35.710 --> 15:37.040
Well, you are.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.580
I love you,
Gary Mendez.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.380
Can I help you?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.290
I'm looking
for Barbara Morgan.

16:06.330 --> 16:07.830
There's nobody here
by that name.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.250
Please. I --
I really need to talk to her.

16:10.250 --> 16:11.670
She doesn't live here.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.710
My name is Delilah Dixon,

16:15.710 --> 16:19.420
and I think she may know things
about my husband.

16:19.420 --> 16:21.960
Look, your friends have come by.
I'm sorry.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.080
I don't know what to tell you,
but I don't know who that is.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.420
Barbara, please!

16:25.420 --> 16:26.540
You need to leave.

16:26.540 --> 16:29.120
Mitch. Let her in.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.250
Look, I know
you don't want me here,

16:48.250 --> 16:51.580
and I'm n-- I'm not even sure
I want to be here.

16:51.580 --> 16:53.120
It's just...

16:53.120 --> 16:55.580
I don't know
how you knew my husband.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.460
And for the longest time,
I didn't want to know.

16:57.460 --> 16:58.460
but now, I...

17:00.420 --> 17:02.040
...I just need
to know.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.500
Well, she doesn't have
anything to tell you.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.420
Then why did you
come into my house?

17:09.750 --> 17:13.000
Well, sh--
she's pregnant, Mitch.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.670
Just like I was.

17:14.670 --> 17:15.750
You need to go.

17:15.750 --> 17:16.880
Were you two together?

17:16.880 --> 17:18.540
D-Did you have --

17:18.540 --> 17:20.250
I dated his roommate Dave.

17:22.120 --> 17:26.830
Patrick is gonna be home
in 20 minutes.

17:26.830 --> 17:29.040
She better not
still be here.

17:32.920 --> 17:33.960
Sorry.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.120
Come on in.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.120
So...what are you
gonna do?

17:45.210 --> 17:47.420
I'm gonna fight
for my marriage.

17:47.420 --> 17:50.040
That's beautiful, man.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.080
All I want
is for you to be happy.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.040
I hope you believe that.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.420
If you're telling me
that you and Katherine

17:55.420 --> 17:56.790
have a chance
to make that happen --

17:56.790 --> 18:00.080
and this time,
without any lies.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.710
And if you want
my opinion,

18:01.710 --> 18:03.580
I think
it's a very good decision.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.380
Unlike...

18:06.380 --> 18:09.750
you routing us
through O'Hare.

18:12.670 --> 18:15.420
How could you fly us
through O'Hare, Ed?

18:15.420 --> 18:17.540
Everybody knows
it is the worst airport

18:17.540 --> 18:18.540
for weather delays.

18:18.540 --> 18:19.540
Apparently,
not everyone.

18:19.540 --> 18:21.620
It's June!
There's no snow!

18:21.620 --> 18:24.210
Wind! Fog!
Rain! Lightning!

18:24.210 --> 18:26.330
O'Hare's got everything
but on-time departures.

18:26.330 --> 18:27.500
It's literally
the perfect storm!

18:27.500 --> 18:28.620
Gary.
What?

18:28.620 --> 18:30.290
We're gonna miss Game 7
of the Stanley Cup

18:30.290 --> 18:32.500
so that he could save --
How much was it again?

18:32.500 --> 18:33.540
$20.

18:33.540 --> 18:35.170
$20.

18:35.170 --> 18:37.540
That's much how it costs
for a cup of coffee at O'Hare.

18:37.540 --> 18:38.830
You know what?
Come on.

18:38.830 --> 18:40.580
I got this.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.750
Dave and Jon met
their first day at Harvard.

18:42.750 --> 18:44.330
They were
like brothers.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.710
Jon treated his friends
like family.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.120
Yeah.

18:50.670 --> 18:53.120
Jon had a real estate
conference to go to,

18:53.120 --> 18:56.080
and he had
convinced Dave...

18:56.080 --> 18:57.620
to tag along.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.920
He had a way
of making everything fun.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.120
Gary: Come on, Jon.
Blackhawks?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.080
It's not even
the right team.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.830
Gentlemen,
it looks like

19:04.830 --> 19:07.210
we are not gonna make it
to Game 7.

19:07.210 --> 19:10.790
So we are going to be
Game 7.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.040
I call Bruins.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.880
Oh!

19:23.380 --> 19:24.880
Oh, snap!
Sorry, ma'am!

19:45.620 --> 19:47.620
Rome:
He's good. He's good.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.420
Come on, Eddie.
Bring us home.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.620
Woman on P.A.: Attention.

19:52.620 --> 19:53.960
Please check the board,
as flights are now departing.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.250
Hey. Guys.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.080
-What?
-Wha--?

19:56.080 --> 19:57.710
Oh, oh!
Airport's open.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.120
Our flight leaves
in 20 minutes.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.210
Oh, let's go! Let's go!
We can still make the game!

20:01.210 --> 20:03.040
Eddie: And we saved $20.
Are you kidding me?

20:06.830 --> 20:08.540
I need
to show you something.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.880
Jon mailed this to me
the day he died.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.290
Delilah: Oh, my God --
the memory card.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.830
He did leave a message.

20:19.330 --> 20:21.540
Barbara, I know
I don't have the right

20:21.540 --> 20:24.120
to ask you to forgive me.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.620
But for me to move on, I --

20:26.620 --> 20:29.500
After everything that happened,
I just couldn't look back.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.120
As you said to me,

20:31.120 --> 20:32.960
part of being ready
for the future

20:32.960 --> 20:34.920
is letting go of the past.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.460
Yeah, don't worry.

20:36.460 --> 20:38.080
I'm coming, okay?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.420
I'm telling you,
you're gonna want

20:39.420 --> 20:42.170
a bottle of wine
when we get there.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.540
Well, just don't let the flight
take off without me.

20:46.290 --> 20:48.710
You know what? Keep it.
Thank you.

20:48.710 --> 20:49.960
Excuse me.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.290
Hey! Wait!
Hold the door!

20:53.290 --> 20:54.830
That's my plane.

20:54.830 --> 20:56.000
Flight attendant:
I'm sorry, sir.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.880
We've already closed
the jet bridge.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.120
Here's the head count.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.120
No, don't --
Give that back to her.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.290
Just add one.

21:02.290 --> 21:04.250
I have to get
on the plane.

21:04.250 --> 21:07.120
Once the jet bridge door
is closed, I can't open it.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.710
I understand you're just doing
your job. Okay?

21:09.710 --> 21:12.210
I'm asking you, please, just --
just open the door.

21:12.210 --> 21:13.880
I'm sorry, sir.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.830
I don't think you are,
by the way.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.000
Hey.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.500
Look out your window.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.380
Yeah, you're right.
I missed it.

21:35.380 --> 21:36.750
Okay. All right.

21:36.750 --> 21:41.040
Well, a-at least I have a drink
while I'm waiting.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.040
Uh, I'll have to catch
the next flight, I guess.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.040
Sorry, Dave.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.750
I'll see you in Los Angeles.

21:48.500 --> 21:52.170
Jon: Had I known that would be
the last time I spoke to him,

21:52.170 --> 21:54.620
there's so much more
I would have said.

22:05.170 --> 22:07.170
Jon was supposed to be
on that flight.

22:08.710 --> 22:10.170
Flight 11.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.120
He never told me that.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.830
I --

22:41.830 --> 22:43.380
I never knew.

22:45.210 --> 22:47.710
The last time
I saw Jon was...

22:47.710 --> 22:50.920
a few months
after the funeral.

22:50.920 --> 22:54.750
He wanted us to meet
at Logan -- at the gate.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.580
It was March 12th --

22:56.580 --> 22:58.120
Dave's birthday.

23:00.290 --> 23:04.790
As much as Jon wouldn't
let himself move past it,

23:04.790 --> 23:06.120
I had to.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.290
Hey.

23:07.290 --> 23:09.500
I was pregnant.

23:09.500 --> 23:13.210
I met a first responder --
a firefighter.

23:13.210 --> 23:14.460
Mitch.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.790
Jon just thought
it was too soon.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.040
You're engaged?!

23:18.040 --> 23:19.330
Yeah.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.460
To who? The -- The --
The firefighter?

23:21.460 --> 23:23.960
I can't do this
alone, Jon.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.380
Mitch said
he would do it with me.

23:28.380 --> 23:30.210
Oh, and that's
how you remember Dave?

23:30.210 --> 23:33.040
You don't get to tell me
how to mourn, Jon.

23:33.040 --> 23:37.080
The truth is...

23:37.080 --> 23:40.210
I will never forgive myself for
what I said to you that day.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.420
You still have this?!

23:41.420 --> 23:42.920
Barbara, he wouldn't
have been on the plane

23:42.920 --> 23:44.420
if it wasn't for me!

23:44.420 --> 23:47.500
Jon, none of this
is gonna bring Dave back.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.330
Maybe.

23:49.330 --> 23:51.040
But it's better
than just pretending

23:51.040 --> 23:53.000
he never existed
in the first place.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.040
That day at the airport,

23:55.040 --> 23:58.120
when you told me to find
something to live for...

23:58.120 --> 23:59.210
I did.

24:13.500 --> 24:14.750
Oh.

24:15.710 --> 24:17.080
Here you go.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.040
Thank you.
Sure.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.500
Did your flight
get delayed, too?

24:24.830 --> 24:26.790
Something like that.

24:26.790 --> 24:28.120
Where are you headed?

24:30.170 --> 24:32.920
I was supposed to go to L.A.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.460
Mm.

24:34.460 --> 24:37.170
Delilah was
the love of my life.

24:37.170 --> 24:40.620
For 17 years, she's given me
more than she'll ever know.

24:40.620 --> 24:42.460
But I just couldn't tell her.

24:45.580 --> 24:49.000
As long as I could,
I just pushed the pain away.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.250
You let him live.

24:58.250 --> 25:01.170
For 17 years.

25:01.170 --> 25:03.080
You let him live.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.540
Until he couldn't do it
anymore.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.380
Why didn't Mitch want you
to tell me any of this?

25:19.420 --> 25:23.040
Your son doesn't know
what happened to his father.

25:23.040 --> 25:24.750
Mitch is his father.

25:26.380 --> 25:28.330
Hey. Patrick's home.

25:28.330 --> 25:29.580
She needs to leave.

25:29.580 --> 25:30.920
Okay.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.790
Thank you for this.

25:36.830 --> 25:38.000
Patrick: Hey, Dad.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.460
Hey. What are you doing?
Huh?

25:42.290 --> 25:44.670
Fuel up my truck?
Huh?

25:44.670 --> 25:45.880
You hungry?
Yeah.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.500
Let me cook you an egg.
Come on, sit down.

25:47.500 --> 25:48.920
Relax.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.330
Wow.

26:00.540 --> 26:03.330
So that's why
he said in the letter

26:03.330 --> 26:06.540
that he was broken
long before he met me.

26:06.540 --> 26:08.540
Okay, but why couldn't he
tell us?

26:10.210 --> 26:12.210
Probably the same reason

26:12.210 --> 26:14.330
he didn't talk to Barbara
all those years.

26:16.460 --> 26:19.670
The guilt was too much.

26:19.670 --> 26:22.000
So he just focused
on us.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
He kept trying to save us --
the way he couldn't save Dave.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.380
You were right.

26:28.380 --> 26:31.170
I thought
if I knew everything,

26:31.170 --> 26:36.170
if we turned over the stone
that explained everything,

26:36.170 --> 26:37.500
I'd feel better.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.210
I don't.

26:44.830 --> 26:46.040
You probably won't.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.290
'Cause there is
no one answer.

26:51.290 --> 26:55.920
His financial debt,
what happened with Dave...

26:55.920 --> 26:59.290
there's no one reason
why he did what he did.

27:01.620 --> 27:06.250
Everyone responds to tragedy
in different ways.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.330
But it's never
just one stone.

27:10.620 --> 27:15.250
It's a bunch of stones
stacked up on top of each other.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.080
Hunter:
It's gonna be a late night.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.460
Be back here in five, guys.
Let's order dinner.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.790
Hey, Katherine, can I talk
to you for a second?

27:31.080 --> 27:34.170
Look, I just...
wanted to clear the air.

27:35.540 --> 27:38.500
I just don't want it to be
awkward 'cause I made partner.

27:39.710 --> 27:41.040
I was just hoping
the two of us

27:41.040 --> 27:42.330
could be professional
about all this,

27:42.330 --> 27:44.750
because I'm --
I'm really concerned

27:44.750 --> 27:46.170
it's starting
to affect your work.

27:48.290 --> 27:50.120
Well...

27:52.250 --> 27:54.670
...while we're
clearing the air, Hunter,

27:54.670 --> 27:56.580
I should tell you

27:56.580 --> 27:59.290
that the only reason
you made partner is because...

27:59.290 --> 28:01.500
I turned it down.

28:01.500 --> 28:02.790
That's right.

28:02.790 --> 28:04.580
You were
their second choice.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.290
Maybe their third.

28:06.290 --> 28:08.750
I don't know how many people
they went to between me and you.

28:10.290 --> 28:12.380
The reason why
I turned it down is because

28:12.380 --> 28:14.210
I told the firm
that from now on,

28:14.210 --> 28:17.120
I'm gonna be home for dinner
with my family.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.330
Which is
where I'm going now.

28:18.330 --> 28:22.080
So good luck
with the appeal.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.580
I'm glad
we cleared the air.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.580
Salesman:
They're just washing it now.

28:32.580 --> 28:35.580
It's gonna take about 45 minutes
to prep your new sports car.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.290
With the --
The alloys, extra set
of floor mats, and a key chain.

28:38.290 --> 28:39.830
Yes.
I talked to my manager.

28:39.830 --> 28:41.620
Thank you.

28:43.710 --> 28:46.960
All right, Gina.
That was pretty amazing.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.750
Another 10 minutes,
he'd probably thrown in
one of these for free.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.790
Oh, but then he'd have to
talk to his manager.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.080
I know that move.

28:53.620 --> 28:55.080
Excuse me, Rome.

28:55.080 --> 28:57.670
Can you step into my office
for a minute?

29:00.040 --> 29:03.920
Babe, the only downside
to your new car is,

29:03.920 --> 29:06.750
I'm gonna have to get
a new wardrobe to go with it.

29:06.750 --> 29:07.880
I assumed.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.170
I'm going full
"Breakfast at Tiffany's."

29:10.330 --> 29:12.710
The head scarf,
sunglasses.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.380
Something
from Tiffany's.

29:14.380 --> 29:16.620
I mean, I want it
to be authentic.

29:21.540 --> 29:23.750
I think we should
get this car instead.

29:23.750 --> 29:25.460
Sure.

29:25.460 --> 29:28.290
Audrey Hepburn wouldn't
be caught dead in this car.

29:31.500 --> 29:32.750
Are you serious?

29:34.500 --> 29:37.670
Rome, they're out there prepping
your dream car right now.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.710
I mean, I've got one for work,
and I love it...

29:39.710 --> 29:42.040
but, you know,
this is the car people get

29:42.040 --> 29:45.000
when they're having kids
in the next couple years.

29:47.580 --> 29:49.670
I think
we should get it.

29:58.120 --> 30:01.500
What is happening?

30:01.500 --> 30:05.250
When I found that
pregnancy stick in our bathroom,

30:05.250 --> 30:07.120
I thought
you were pregnant.

30:07.120 --> 30:09.880
I kind of liked it.

30:09.880 --> 30:12.710
Wait, what are you
talking about?

30:12.710 --> 30:15.830
When we got married, we said
we weren't having kids.

30:15.830 --> 30:18.580
When we said that, I thought
having kids meant having a baby.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.540
It does.
It's exactly what it means.

30:20.540 --> 30:22.580
No.

30:22.580 --> 30:26.210
After stepping up this year
for Sophie and Danny

30:26.210 --> 30:29.250
and helping the kid
that read my script,

30:29.250 --> 30:32.170
it just made me realize
that having a kid means...

30:32.170 --> 30:34.000
raising a person.

30:37.330 --> 30:40.120
I really want
to raise a person with you.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.920
Jon: How do you say
"umbrella"?

30:58.920 --> 31:02.170
Um..."par-a-pluie."

31:02.170 --> 31:04.580
"Para-pluie."

31:07.330 --> 31:10.710
How do you say, uh,
"bar napkin"?

31:10.710 --> 31:13.210
Mm...
"serviette de bar."

31:13.210 --> 31:15.540
"De Bar"?
It's "bar"?

31:15.540 --> 31:16.710
"Serviette de bar."

31:16.710 --> 31:18.250
Okay.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.460
Uh, how would you say...

31:21.460 --> 31:24.290
"Will you go on a date
with me?"

31:24.290 --> 31:26.000
Hmm.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.960
That would be...

31:28.960 --> 31:32.380
Et si on dînait ensemble?

31:32.380 --> 31:34.080
Sure.

31:34.080 --> 31:37.040
A little forward,
but, yeah, let's do it.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.460
Okay.

31:42.380 --> 31:45.620
Woman on P.A.:
Flight 44 to Paris
is now boarding.

31:45.620 --> 31:46.880
This is me.

31:46.880 --> 31:48.540
Okay.

31:50.330 --> 31:51.960
This, uh,
this was fun.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.080
Yeah.
Yeah, thank you.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.420
Yeah.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Um...

32:00.000 --> 32:02.170
It's, uh,
for French lessons.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.290
Don't forget that.

32:12.710 --> 32:14.880
Bon voyage!

32:24.210 --> 32:26.580
Where are you headed?

32:26.580 --> 32:29.540
I was supposed to go to L.A.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.830
You know, the last time
Jon and I saw each other,

32:48.830 --> 32:50.670
we got in a fight?

32:50.670 --> 32:54.000
He was mad at me for breaking up
with this woman...

32:55.250 --> 32:57.960
...who was trying to leave
a phone charger at my place.

32:59.670 --> 33:00.710
Our place.

33:00.710 --> 33:01.880
Our place.

33:03.620 --> 33:06.290
I wish
he could see all this.

33:06.290 --> 33:10.380
And I wish
I could say I'm sorry...

33:10.380 --> 33:12.170
for the ugly things
I said.

33:14.380 --> 33:16.830
I wish
I could thank him...

33:16.830 --> 33:19.500
for getting me to today.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.500
I wish he was here.

33:26.710 --> 33:27.670
I know.

33:29.250 --> 33:31.750
He really did take care
of all of us.

33:38.420 --> 33:39.580
It's like D said.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.120
He spent
the rest of his life

33:41.120 --> 33:44.080
trying to make up for the fact
that he couldn't save Dave.

33:47.170 --> 33:49.540
Gary,
you have to be sure

33:49.540 --> 33:51.460
you're not doing
the same thing.

33:54.250 --> 33:57.790
I love everything
you've done for me.

33:59.460 --> 34:03.000
But I do think that
part of the reason you did it

34:03.000 --> 34:06.620
is because you feel like
you couldn't save Jon.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.250
I should have seen it.

34:14.250 --> 34:16.120
I was his best friend.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.290
All right, roomie.

34:19.620 --> 34:20.960
Come on.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.250
Grab your coat.

34:27.040 --> 34:28.830
Are you telling me you never
thought about having a kid?

34:28.830 --> 34:30.580
Of course I have.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.710
But then I think of
every other thing in our life

34:32.710 --> 34:35.670
and how it doesn't
fit in with that.

34:35.670 --> 34:37.960
Then we switch it around
to make it fit.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.830
Like what?

34:39.830 --> 34:43.920
Rome, I practically
live at the restaurant.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.750
I mean, who's gonna take care
of this kid?

34:45.750 --> 34:47.250
Me.

34:47.250 --> 34:49.460
I-I-I can stay home and write
with the baby.

34:49.460 --> 34:51.460
You bought
noise-canceling headphones

34:51.460 --> 34:54.330
because you said
I eat grapes too loudly.

34:54.330 --> 34:55.620
I am never
gonna live that down.

34:56.790 --> 34:59.920
And -- And, babe...

34:59.920 --> 35:01.750
I don't know
that we can put anything else

35:01.750 --> 35:03.170
on our plate right now.

35:03.170 --> 35:05.670
'Cause, honestly...

35:05.670 --> 35:07.790
I'm...still worried
about you.

35:07.790 --> 35:09.540
I know you are.

35:11.960 --> 35:14.120
But maybe, Gina,

35:14.120 --> 35:17.040
having a baby might help
put everything in perspective.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.080
And what if it doesn't?

35:24.500 --> 35:26.500
And what happened
to being practical?

35:26.500 --> 35:29.670
Do you have any idea
how much raising a baby costs?

35:29.670 --> 35:30.710
How much?

35:30.710 --> 35:31.880
Exactly.

35:31.880 --> 35:32.880
We don't even know.

35:34.880 --> 35:36.620
Oh.

35:39.710 --> 35:41.210
Hey, D.
Everything okay?

35:42.580 --> 35:44.000
Oh, my God.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.750
Yep, we're on our way.

35:46.750 --> 35:48.460
You wanted a baby.

35:48.460 --> 35:49.880
You got one.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.330
Are you serious?
Serious.

35:59.120 --> 36:06.080
Don't Think I'll Ever

36:06.080 --> 36:09.750
I know I don't have the right
to ask you to forgive me.

36:09.750 --> 36:12.920
I know how hard it'll be
on everyone once I'm gone.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.080
Even after all this...

36:15.080 --> 36:17.250
♪ I drink good coffee ♪

36:17.250 --> 36:18.960
...you're still my best friend.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.880
♪ Every morning ♪

36:21.880 --> 36:24.210
Jon, you used to say that

36:24.210 --> 36:26.420
