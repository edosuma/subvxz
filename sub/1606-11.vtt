01:18.967 --> 01:23.388
Super Storm Wanda is still gaining force
moving steadily up the Eastern Seaboard.

01:23.472 --> 01:25.933
Winds are expected to
dissipate considerably

01:26.016 --> 01:27.184
before making landfall,

01:27.267 --> 01:30.729
but this is still going to
be a very large winter storm.

01:30.813 --> 01:34.692
Oh, hell. Is this every year now?

01:35.484 --> 01:36.902
I hope my family's all right.

01:36.985 --> 01:39.488
Michael and Crystal will be fine.

01:39.572 --> 01:41.949
They have a roof over their
heads. Think about poor Jimmy.

01:42.741 --> 01:44.493
You're the one who's opening
your door to this shit.

01:44.577 --> 01:45.828
- Stop.
- Hey, hey!

01:45.911 --> 01:49.122
Okay, so we want the
B-Dorm bathroom repaired,

01:49.206 --> 01:51.333
restrictions on SHU as
a punitive instrument,

01:51.417 --> 01:53.419
and non-toxic laundry detergent.

01:53.502 --> 01:55.170
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

01:55.253 --> 01:58.841
Real maple syrup. I hate that fake-o kind.

01:58.924 --> 02:02.177
- So nasty.
- Actually, I like the fake kind better.

02:02.260 --> 02:03.846
We're gonna have to discuss this more.

02:03.929 --> 02:06.014
What? No!

02:06.098 --> 02:08.058
Turn in the damn demands.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.352
We've been working on
this for a week already.

02:10.436 --> 02:12.646
Somebody's cranky.

02:12.730 --> 02:15.858
Maybe if somebody hadn't just
joined the strike this morning,

02:15.941 --> 02:17.400
they'd be cranky, too.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.527
I'm sorry...

02:18.611 --> 02:21.530
I thought this was a movement
where everyone's ideas were valid.

02:21.614 --> 02:23.616
Excuse me!

02:24.407 --> 02:27.703
Will you take your powwow somewhere
else? We're trying to hear the television.

02:27.786 --> 02:30.539
Well, we're trying to
effect positive change.

02:31.790 --> 02:33.125
Can you please do it quietly?

02:33.208 --> 02:36.294
I'd think it would be
important to you, too, Sister.

02:36.378 --> 02:37.420
Yeah, aren't you in here

02:37.505 --> 02:40.215
'cause you chained yourself to a
flagpole at a nuclear test site?

02:42.468 --> 02:45.220
It was for trespassing
at a nuclear facility

02:45.303 --> 02:48.641
and the flagpole was at
the School for the Americas.

02:48.724 --> 02:49.725
And that's all behind me.

02:49.808 --> 02:53.729
I'm old. I have low blood sugar.

02:53.812 --> 02:54.938
I was hoping that prison

02:55.022 --> 02:57.816
would give me a chance to find
the time for solemn contemplation.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.485
Yeah? Of what?

03:00.569 --> 03:02.988
Being a pussy?

03:07.200 --> 03:11.121
Sister Jane, you must remember
to keep garments clean and ironed.

03:11.204 --> 03:12.205
Yes, Sister.

03:12.289 --> 03:14.542
- And don't be late for meals.
- I won't.

03:14.625 --> 03:16.418
And don't speak at meals.

03:16.501 --> 03:18.503
And don't ever talk to Sister Jen.

03:18.587 --> 03:20.088
Why? Has she taken a vow?

03:20.172 --> 03:22.591
No, she's just terribly irritating.

03:22.675 --> 03:24.968
Do you have any other questions?

03:25.052 --> 03:26.679
Well, I... I do have one.

03:30.473 --> 03:32.267
How long before Jesus speaks to me?

03:32.350 --> 03:34.311
Do you not speak to Jesus in your prayers?

03:34.394 --> 03:35.688
Yes, I speak to him.

03:37.022 --> 03:39.775
It's been a one-sided conversation so far.

03:39.858 --> 03:41.610
And the other sisters are always going on

03:41.694 --> 03:44.947
about how Jesus speaks to them
and... tells them he loves them...

03:45.030 --> 03:47.616
The other sisters like to brag.

03:47.700 --> 03:51.704
But Christ only comes to those
humble in their devotion to the lord.

03:52.621 --> 03:58.043
Focus not on what Christ may do for
you... but on what you can do for Christ.

03:59.044 --> 04:00.671
Good tip.

04:00.754 --> 04:02.047
Thank you, Sister Kennedy.

04:03.716 --> 04:04.883
Constance.

04:06.426 --> 04:10.013
Rally in Washington.
Stop the war in Vietnam.

04:11.181 --> 04:12.265
What are you doing?

04:12.349 --> 04:13.559
There's a rally tomorrow.

04:13.642 --> 04:14.852
A rally?

04:14.935 --> 04:17.813
I didn't even think we were
allowed to read the newspaper

04:17.896 --> 04:19.648
- until we take the veil.
- Yes.

04:19.732 --> 04:21.774
Put those away before
Sister Constance sees you.

04:21.858 --> 04:23.611
This is important.

04:23.694 --> 04:26.488
Indiscriminate war is a crime against God.

04:26.572 --> 04:28.156
Sister Constance gave
her blessing for this.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.491
She did?

04:31.409 --> 04:33.203
Oh, well, that's different.

04:33.286 --> 04:35.873
"Rock Against Rape"?

04:35.956 --> 04:37.958
"Rape and Roll"? "Rape the Vote"!

04:38.041 --> 04:42.295
"Rape" has to be in the title
to connect it with the story.

04:42.379 --> 04:45.633
A small concert... somewhere.

04:45.716 --> 04:47.217
Good PR for the prison.

04:47.300 --> 04:48.510
Right, the prison.

04:48.594 --> 04:54.016
Mmm, this shameful sexual violation is
really working out for you, isn't it?

04:54.099 --> 04:57.686
I am just happy that we have
helped to start a dialogue.

04:58.937 --> 05:00.898
And I wanna thank you, Joe,

05:00.981 --> 05:03.692
for your assistance in my handling of this.

05:03.776 --> 05:05.277
You deserve recognition.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.820
Hmm.

05:06.904 --> 05:10.616
How about a token of your
appreciation in the $200 to $300 range?

05:10.699 --> 05:13.368
In lieu of that, I have
something else for you.

05:13.451 --> 05:15.913
B-Dorm bathroom.

05:15.996 --> 05:16.997
You're fixing it?

05:17.080 --> 05:20.083
With a contractor off the approved
list. We got a very good price.

05:20.167 --> 05:22.002
That's great. That's great.

05:22.085 --> 05:23.086
How much?

05:23.170 --> 05:26.548
A very good price. And I
have some more good news!

05:26.632 --> 05:29.051
In light of the recent events,

05:29.134 --> 05:32.054
the warden is sending
you some new riot gear.

05:32.137 --> 05:33.471
Riot gear?

05:34.765 --> 05:35.808
How's that gonna prevent rape?

05:35.891 --> 05:37.392
Well, it's not gonna prevent rape,

05:37.475 --> 05:41.271
but if somebody is raped
and it incites a riot...

05:42.480 --> 05:46.109
We got some new gear in max and
we're sending you the old stuff.

05:46.193 --> 05:49.404
Just send the warden a thank you.

05:49.487 --> 05:51.364
I will.

05:51.448 --> 05:53.158
And... by the way,

05:53.241 --> 05:57.120
if you end up doing this concert
and you're looking for a band...

05:57.204 --> 06:01.458
Oh, yeah, we... we have that
covered, but... but thank you.

06:02.751 --> 06:04.044
Got it.

06:11.509 --> 06:13.762
Sorry the comic's not very funny this week.

06:13.846 --> 06:15.597
Oh, no, I think it's great.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.681
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:16.765 --> 06:17.766
You're not just saying that

06:17.850 --> 06:20.560
because you feel sorry for
me 'cause I'm, like, a victim?

06:20.643 --> 06:22.187
No, not at all.

06:23.188 --> 06:24.189
And I thought

06:24.272 --> 06:26.859
what the horse said to
the eagle was very brave.

06:28.026 --> 06:30.863
Oh, it's a hawk, not an eagle.

06:31.864 --> 06:33.448
Oh, yeah.  But... thanks.

06:33.531 --> 06:35.408
Hey, Chapman, sorry I'm late with this.

06:35.492 --> 06:36.493
What is it?

06:36.576 --> 06:39.287
Our strike demands for the paper.

06:39.371 --> 06:43.583
Oh, absolutely not. Forget
it. It'll never get past Healy.

06:43.666 --> 06:44.960
Besides, the paper's already laid out.

06:45.043 --> 06:49.047
I've got 300 words on Scott O'Neill's
love for Civil War memorabilia.

06:49.840 --> 06:50.966
Please?

06:51.049 --> 06:52.675
Could you at least try?

06:54.636 --> 06:56.805
Fine... I'll put it in,

06:56.889 --> 06:59.057
but I guarantee you it's
gonna end up in the trash.

06:59.141 --> 07:01.018
Thank you, Chapman.

07:01.101 --> 07:02.602
History will remember you for this,

07:02.685 --> 07:05.188
although I still don't
trust you personally.

07:05.272 --> 07:08.316
Revolution makes for
strange bedfellows, huh?

07:08.400 --> 07:09.651
Not like we're going to bed together...

07:09.735 --> 07:11.779
Brook, have you heard of the Gandhi quote,

07:11.862 --> 07:14.697
"Speak only if it
improves upon the silence"?

07:14.782 --> 07:16.992
No... I haven't.

07:17.075 --> 07:19.161
What was the context? I love Gandhi.

07:19.244 --> 07:22.247
That was a man who knew how to revolt.

07:22.330 --> 07:24.624
Did you know he was born
and died on a Friday?

07:24.707 --> 07:26.709
And also, he had really bad handwriting.

07:26.794 --> 07:30.297
Also, they say he slept with
two naked women in his bed not...

07:30.380 --> 07:33.008
Hey, can I... can I
talk to you for a minute?

07:33.091 --> 07:34.342
Is that an order?

07:34.426 --> 07:35.677
No.

07:35.761 --> 07:37.345
Then no.

07:37.429 --> 07:38.721
I'm busy.

07:48.273 --> 07:49.732
You're back at work.

07:49.817 --> 07:53.028
That was a nasty fall you took.

07:53.111 --> 07:54.112
Hold up now. Where you going?

07:54.196 --> 07:55.781
I'm trying to talk to you, stop.

07:57.991 --> 08:02.370
All I'm trying to say to you is I
can give you some Arnica for the pain.

08:02.454 --> 08:05.833
Look like you're hurt...
and we're neighbors...

08:05.916 --> 08:08.210
more than neighbors.

08:08.293 --> 08:09.878
You live at my house.

08:09.962 --> 08:10.963
Let me ask you something.

08:11.046 --> 08:14.007
You come back to prison on accident

08:14.091 --> 08:17.552
or 'cause outside you're too
weak for anybody to take serious?

08:17.635 --> 08:20.430
What, you got some kids think you hot shit?

08:21.556 --> 08:23.141
Big deal.

08:23.225 --> 08:25.643
You're like a pedophile without the sex.

08:27.813 --> 08:33.068
Bet the real players laugh in your face.

08:33.150 --> 08:35.778
Probably fuck you for free, too.

08:40.158 --> 08:43.160
How much worse do you want this to get?

08:44.537 --> 08:45.747
Hmm?

08:45.831 --> 08:47.207
How much worse you got?

08:48.666 --> 08:49.960
Bring it.

08:51.669 --> 08:53.421
What do I got left to lose?

09:03.181 --> 09:04.933
Chapman, come in.

09:05.017 --> 09:07.185
- You got the paper?
- Yes, I do.

09:07.269 --> 09:08.270
Good.

09:08.353 --> 09:09.687
- You put the ad in?
- Yes.

09:11.689 --> 09:13.275
It's right here.

09:15.402 --> 09:19.114
You know, some of the other girls
aren't sure what you're advertising.

09:19.197 --> 09:21.992
"Safe Place." It sounds
like a preschool playgroup.

09:22.075 --> 09:23.952
Well, I had to be subtle.

09:24.036 --> 09:26.329
The word "therapy" scares people.

09:26.413 --> 09:28.665
But if you engage people in creative play,

09:28.748 --> 09:31.168
they're more interested in opening
up about what's troubling them.

09:31.251 --> 09:32.961
Sounds like you've been reading up.

09:33.045 --> 09:35.713
You have to with the social sciences.

09:35.797 --> 09:37.715
The theories are constantly evolving.

09:37.799 --> 09:38.800
It's a good thing,

09:38.884 --> 09:42.595
otherwise we'd all still be getting
electroshock therapy for hysteria.

09:42.679 --> 09:44.056
My mother had that.

09:45.515 --> 09:46.516
Oh.

09:46.599 --> 09:49.727
It's pretty effective, actually.

09:49.811 --> 09:52.064
She made a lot of soups after.

09:53.315 --> 09:58.028
Well... anyway... here, let's get this out.

10:00.906 --> 10:01.949
Donaldson!

10:03.783 --> 10:05.660
Yeah.

10:05.743 --> 10:09.039
Go down to the office and
make me 100 copies of this.

10:09.122 --> 10:11.291
- All right.
- Thank you.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.132
While I'm here, I'd like
to ask you something.

10:19.216 --> 10:21.843
Hold on. Hold on.

10:21.927 --> 10:25.263
I want you to take this piece of paper.

10:25.347 --> 10:27.849
I want you to take this pencil.

10:27.933 --> 10:32.354
I want you to write down a feeling
and put it in the Feelings Jar.

10:32.437 --> 10:35.107
- Why?
- You'll see later in Safe Place.

10:35.190 --> 10:37.484
I'm very busy, but I'll be there if I can.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.361
Write down the feeling, Chapman.

10:39.444 --> 10:41.321
All right.

10:41.404 --> 10:44.699
Would you mind signing off on this?
I'd like to add someone to my call list.

10:46.868 --> 10:47.869
Alex Vause?

10:47.953 --> 10:49.371
It's not a lesbian thing.

10:49.454 --> 10:51.373
Still, you think this is a good idea?

10:51.456 --> 10:53.208
No, but she keeps writing me letters,

10:53.291 --> 10:57.129
and I think that it would
help to give us some closure...

10:59.631 --> 11:03.969
which is psychologically not without value.

11:07.472 --> 11:09.891
Thank you, Mr. Healy.

11:09.975 --> 11:11.934
Tell it to the Feelings Jar.

11:21.861 --> 11:23.363
That's a great word.

11:33.540 --> 11:36.834
So what was it, Frieda?
Why did you do it, huh?

11:36.918 --> 11:39.003
Is it because I didn't let you grow pot?

11:39.087 --> 11:41.131
Because I over-watered your tomatoes?

11:41.214 --> 11:43.758
What did it take to sell me out?

11:43.841 --> 11:45.552
Red, I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:45.635 --> 11:47.845
- I give you fiber supplements!
- Red, come on.

11:47.929 --> 11:49.431
I give you BENGAY!

11:49.514 --> 11:51.891
- And this is how you repay me?
- Red! Hey, hey!

11:51.974 --> 11:53.435
I...

11:53.518 --> 11:55.728
I don't know what she's talkin' about.

12:00.192 --> 12:01.651
Fuck.

12:01.734 --> 12:04.612
Red, come on, you just
got your family back.

12:04.696 --> 12:06.906
You wanna mess things up
making crazy accusations?

12:06.989 --> 12:09.951
I know it's her. She's the Judas.

12:10.034 --> 12:12.329
Oh, and you're Jesus, huh?

12:12.412 --> 12:14.122
Come on.

12:14.206 --> 12:17.542
You don't know she talked
any more than Norma did.

12:19.877 --> 12:21.213
Norma.

12:22.422 --> 12:26.551
All right... now I know you're paranoid.

12:26.634 --> 12:30.722
Look... all right, maybe Vee
just put two and two together.

12:30.805 --> 12:33.808
You know, we're not talking about
Batcave-level secrecy here, right?

12:35.059 --> 12:37.019
Yeah, word.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.105
And it's not like

12:38.188 --> 12:41.233
you don't talk about this shit
in normal volume in public places.

12:41.316 --> 12:42.734
Dummies.

12:42.817 --> 12:44.444
This isn't your bathroom.

12:44.527 --> 12:46.904
I can take a shit where the fuck I want.

12:46.988 --> 12:51.826
And... they got contractors
on the black side.

12:51.909 --> 12:53.495
Finally getting renovated.

12:53.578 --> 12:56.748
Hell! Moving on up!

12:59.126 --> 13:01.419
Don't you have a conscience?

13:01.503 --> 13:04.339
Bringing drugs into this place?

13:04.422 --> 13:06.633
Don't you remember what happened to Tricia?

13:06.716 --> 13:07.717
Yeah.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.971
I remember the Alamo, too,

13:12.054 --> 13:14.224
but that don't keep me
from eating Mexican food.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.354
And drugs in the prison ain't
the craziest thing to ever happen.

13:19.437 --> 13:20.980
I'll tell you what is, though.

13:21.063 --> 13:26.778
You thinking you can open a road... and
say only white people can drive on it.

13:27.779 --> 13:28.863
Uh-uh.

13:28.946 --> 13:31.199
This America.

13:31.283 --> 13:34.035
The bathrooms may be segregated...

13:34.118 --> 13:36.120
but the market be free.

13:38.623 --> 13:44.462
Oh, but, uh... FYI,
somebody did rat you out.

13:44.546 --> 13:46.964
It was Boo. Puff out.

13:51.553 --> 13:54.806
Well... that was a short mystery.

14:00.853 --> 14:03.731
We got billy clubs and helmets and shields.

14:03.815 --> 14:04.816
Man, this stuff is great.

14:04.899 --> 14:07.109
Yeah, hopefully, we never have to use it.

14:08.027 --> 14:10.405
Great, great. Oh, my God!

14:10.488 --> 14:11.489
Is that tear gas?

14:11.573 --> 14:14.659
- What? Let me see that.
- Hey! Take it easy. Careful!

14:15.993 --> 14:19.247
Just take an inventory and lock
this stuff up in the armory.

14:19.331 --> 14:20.915
Armory?

14:22.334 --> 14:23.501
Weapons holding.

14:24.919 --> 14:27.129
- The big closet!
- Oh, yeah.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.131
Hey, O'Neill! Look, you're famous.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.842
Hey, let me see that.

14:34.679 --> 14:36.806
You should've used that
other picture I took of you.

14:36.889 --> 14:38.266
Okay, okay. Shush your mush.

14:46.023 --> 14:47.859
What the hell is this?

14:47.942 --> 14:48.943
Hunger strike?

14:49.026 --> 14:50.528
Oh, yeah, you didn't know about that?

14:50.612 --> 14:53.906
No... I didn't fucking know about that.

14:53.990 --> 14:56.451
Okay, do you guys know the human megaphone?

14:56.534 --> 14:57.827
No, what is it?

14:57.910 --> 14:59.579
It's like the Occupy hand signals.

14:59.662 --> 15:02.540
So, what we do is up twinkles for "yay."

15:02.624 --> 15:03.791
- That means "yes."
- Twinkle!

15:03.875 --> 15:05.627
Down twinkles for "nay."

15:05.710 --> 15:08.255
For God's sake, we don't need hand signals.

15:08.338 --> 15:09.547
There's only four of us.

15:09.631 --> 15:12.425
Now. Thinkin' of the future.

15:12.509 --> 15:13.510
Nay.

15:13.593 --> 15:16.763
Okay, fist up... fist
up for "oppose." Fist up.

15:16.846 --> 15:19.098
This means, "I have a question."

15:19.181 --> 15:21.226
All right, who's the leader?

15:21.309 --> 15:22.644
We are a leaderless movement,

15:22.727 --> 15:25.021
or rather... leader-full.

15:25.104 --> 15:27.399
- Let's just say it's you.
- Uh, I'd rather not.

15:27.482 --> 15:30.067
I read your demands.
They're a little confusing.

15:30.151 --> 15:32.862
Well, it's a
work-in-progress.

15:32.945 --> 15:35.407
Well, you say you want
the B-Dorm bathroom fixed.

15:35.490 --> 15:36.491
Done.

15:36.574 --> 15:38.618
- We did it! Yay!
- Yay!

15:38.701 --> 15:41.078
You didn't do anything.
It was already happening.

15:41.829 --> 15:42.872
Oh.

15:42.955 --> 15:44.666
You say you want restrictions
on the use of the SHU.

15:44.749 --> 15:45.917
What does that mean, exactly?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.669
There's no accountability.

15:47.752 --> 15:52.299
People get thrown in for no reason...
for any period of time, arbitrarily.

15:52.382 --> 15:54.634
Watson's been in there,
like, every other month.

15:54.717 --> 15:56.261
She brought that on herself.

15:56.344 --> 15:58.430
As far as the duration of her stay,

15:58.513 --> 16:00.848
there is a system in place
with strict guidelines,

16:00.932 --> 16:05.061
and we are under no obligation
to explain to you how it works.

16:05.144 --> 16:09.441
But as it so happens, your friend,
Watson, is coming out today.

16:09.524 --> 16:11.359
- Yes!
- Congratulations, Yoga!

16:12.860 --> 16:15.738
Again, just a coincidence.
Nothing to do with this.

16:15.822 --> 16:16.823
Oh.

16:16.906 --> 16:18.115
Is there anything else?

16:20.410 --> 16:22.495
There is a maple syrup situation.

16:22.579 --> 16:25.206
Anything I can take seriously?

16:25.290 --> 16:27.667
I have an issue.

16:29.544 --> 16:32.714
What are you going to do about the
quality of senior care in this prison?

16:32.797 --> 16:35.257
Excellent issue, Sister, but
we haven't voted on that yet.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.093
Maybe we could put a pin
in it, talk about it later?

16:37.176 --> 16:40.262
The elderly are the fastest
growing population in prison

16:40.347 --> 16:41.806
and they have special needs.

16:41.889 --> 16:45.393
So-called "compassionate
release" in lieu of care

16:45.477 --> 16:47.061
is completely unacceptable.

16:47.144 --> 16:49.772
You can't dump sick old
ladies on the street.

16:49.856 --> 16:53.985
It's unconscionable,
inhumane and... illegal.

16:56.278 --> 16:59.156
You must meet your obligations.

17:02.619 --> 17:03.828
This just got real.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.376
It's 'cause I called you a pussy, isn't it?

17:12.378 --> 17:13.505
It's for Jimmy.

17:13.588 --> 17:16.674
'Cause I called her a pussy.

17:28.019 --> 17:29.228
Thank you so much.

17:29.311 --> 17:30.813
Are you sure we can't
offer you money for gas?

17:30.897 --> 17:33.775
Just consider it a donation
to your so-called church.

17:38.195 --> 17:39.697
- Bye!
- Bye!

17:44.619 --> 17:46.788
That was wonderful, truly.

17:46.871 --> 17:50.417
It was incredible! Thank
you so much for bringing me.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.919
I was afraid nunning
was going to be boring,

17:53.002 --> 17:54.587
but that was so exciting.

17:54.671 --> 17:57.339
Sisters, where have you been?

17:57.424 --> 17:59.300
We were at the rally.

17:59.384 --> 18:04.055
Sister Constance would
like to see you immediately.

18:04.138 --> 18:06.433
We aren't in trouble, are we?

18:06.516 --> 18:08.350
You told us we had Sister's permission.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.645
- In spirit.
- What?

18:10.728 --> 18:14.356
"Open your mouths, judge righteously,
defend the rights of the poor and needy."

18:14.441 --> 18:15.733
Proverbs 31:9.

18:15.817 --> 18:17.318
You duped us.

18:17.402 --> 18:18.653
I can't believe it.

18:18.736 --> 18:21.406
I fell in with the bad nuns.

18:21.489 --> 18:25.993
So, we'll do some penance.
We do penance all day anyway.

18:26.077 --> 18:28.538
At least now it can be for
something we're proud of.

18:28.621 --> 18:31.248
I mean, what is the point?

18:31.332 --> 18:34.043
To keep our heads down
and be well starched?

18:34.126 --> 18:37.714
We have no jobs... no husbands.

18:37.797 --> 18:41.092
If we don't fight to make the
world a better place, who will?

18:42.093 --> 18:43.344
The pigs?

18:45.262 --> 18:46.473
You know I'm right.

18:48.766 --> 18:50.392
It did feel good.

18:50.477 --> 18:54.606
So, I heard they got a
special cell for you in seg.

18:54.689 --> 18:59.861
Got a plaque outside the door
that say, "Reserved for Watson."

18:59.944 --> 19:00.987
Shut the fuck up!

19:02.530 --> 19:03.948
You got no idea what it's like,

19:04.031 --> 19:05.617
so don't even fucking
act like you fucking know.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.743
Take it easy now. Easy, girl.

19:06.826 --> 19:09.286
You all right, now. You
all right. You're home now.

19:09.370 --> 19:11.038
I got you.

19:11.122 --> 19:12.540
I'm gonna take care of you now. Sit down.

19:12.624 --> 19:14.208
Me, too.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.877
Can I get everybody's attention, please?

19:15.960 --> 19:20.882
This here is the last call
for Safe Place sign-up.

19:20.965 --> 19:24.552
I repeat, it is the last
call for Safe Place sign-up.

19:24.636 --> 19:26.303
What the fuck is Safe Place?

19:27.472 --> 19:28.723
It's Healy's new thing.

19:28.806 --> 19:31.851
It's like some kind of... snitching school.

19:31.934 --> 19:36.773
You go and sound off on people... and
he gives you a shot off your record.

19:36.856 --> 19:38.483
Serious?

19:38.566 --> 19:40.026
Word, I don't lie.

19:41.486 --> 19:44.321
He even got a snitching jar in his office.

19:47.158 --> 19:48.493
Hey, y'all.

19:50.077 --> 19:51.538
Wanna sign up for Safe Place?

19:53.080 --> 19:54.248
We're not interested.

19:54.331 --> 19:55.958
How do you know?

19:58.377 --> 19:59.962
Bald blacky signed up.

20:04.842 --> 20:05.843
Nah.

20:11.307 --> 20:12.725
You want me to sign up?

20:12.809 --> 20:16.103
I could keep an eye on her,
like a... like an eye-spyer.

20:16.187 --> 20:17.939
Yeah, baby, you do that.

20:18.022 --> 20:20.482
- Safe Place! Thank you.
- That is some good thinking.

20:22.193 --> 20:25.780
- My brain will always be there for you.
- Hey, y'all.

20:25.863 --> 20:29.450
Thinking things... so you don't have to.

20:29.534 --> 20:32.411
Safe Place sign-up, last
call over here, anyone?

20:32.494 --> 20:33.538
Hey, Pennsabama!

20:36.207 --> 20:37.542
Wait up.

20:37.625 --> 20:40.795
I know what makes a great radio story.

20:40.878 --> 20:42.547
Alaska's an interesting place.

20:42.630 --> 20:46.467
I wouldn't have gone there if I
thought nobody wanted to hear about it.

20:46.551 --> 20:47.635
Pete, can you come sit down?

20:47.719 --> 20:48.720
But I'm still venting!

20:48.803 --> 20:50.555
We wanna talk to you about something.

20:50.638 --> 20:52.181
Uh-oh.

20:52.264 --> 20:53.683
I sense an ambush here.

20:53.766 --> 20:56.644
Come sit.

20:56.728 --> 20:58.312
I'm not an alcoholic.

20:58.395 --> 21:00.231
I'm Australian.

21:00.314 --> 21:02.316
Sit down.

21:02.399 --> 21:03.610
We don't care if you drink.

21:05.236 --> 21:06.237
Hmm.

21:13.244 --> 21:14.245
Mmm.

21:14.328 --> 21:17.331
Okay, so...

21:17.414 --> 21:21.168
while you were away, Larry and
I spent a lot of time together.

21:21.252 --> 21:22.587
Right. And?

21:22.670 --> 21:23.880
And...

21:25.006 --> 21:27.174
we became close.

21:27.258 --> 21:29.343
Closer than before.

21:29.426 --> 21:30.511
Okay.

21:30.595 --> 21:32.429
This is awkward.

21:32.513 --> 21:34.098
No, mate.

21:34.181 --> 21:35.432
I know what you're gonna say.

21:36.934 --> 21:37.935
You do?

21:38.019 --> 21:39.604
Yeah.

21:39.687 --> 21:41.981
I'm not an idiot.

21:42.064 --> 21:43.608
You think I don't know
what's going on here?

21:43.691 --> 21:45.026
It's nothing we ever planned.

21:45.109 --> 21:46.568
Of course not.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.696
I mean, it all makes sense.

21:48.780 --> 21:50.948
You... Polly...

21:51.032 --> 21:52.033
and me.

21:53.450 --> 21:54.451
And you?

21:54.535 --> 21:55.870
Why not? We're all friends.

21:56.871 --> 21:59.916
No, Pete, this isn't
about having a threesome.

22:01.458 --> 22:02.501
Oh.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.713
No? My bad.

22:05.797 --> 22:06.798
What is it?

22:09.466 --> 22:11.468
I'm leaving you.

22:14.513 --> 22:15.640
Uh...

22:23.314 --> 22:24.732
Uh, for him?

22:24.816 --> 22:26.984
It hasn't been going on long.

22:27.068 --> 22:28.235
You...

22:29.403 --> 22:30.529
cuckolded me?

22:31.989 --> 22:33.615
I never thought of it that way.

22:34.491 --> 22:36.118
You...

22:36.202 --> 22:38.746
fucked my wife without me being there, too.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.081
You cuckolded me!

22:40.164 --> 22:41.373
Pete, let's admit something.

22:41.457 --> 22:43.751
The moment I had the baby, you bailed.

22:43.835 --> 22:45.795
You're not ready to be a grown-up.

22:45.878 --> 22:47.129
And rebound boy is?

22:47.213 --> 22:48.840
Larry fucking shows up.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.092
Look,  you think this is easy?

22:51.175 --> 22:53.427
I'm ending a marriage,
he's ending a relationship,

22:53.510 --> 22:55.429
I fucked my best friend's fiancé.

22:55.512 --> 22:57.181
But it's real.

22:58.850 --> 23:03.645
And... I think it's the best thing
that's ever happened to both of us.

23:06.190 --> 23:07.191
I went away...

23:08.525 --> 23:11.028
so I could be somebody for our son.

23:13.364 --> 23:14.698
Come on, Pete...

23:16.367 --> 23:19.328
you know that's not true.
You went away because...

23:19.411 --> 23:20.997
- Shit!
- Oh!

23:21.080 --> 23:22.498
Don't tell me what I know.

23:22.581 --> 23:24.666
- Pete!
- Fuck!

23:25.877 --> 23:30.131
Oh, fuck!

23:30.214 --> 23:31.673
- Oh. Oh, my God.
- Shit.

23:35.887 --> 23:37.638
You got a minute?

23:37.721 --> 23:40.016
What, you can't find
your other mommy nowhere?

23:41.100 --> 23:43.060
Kidding.

23:43.144 --> 23:44.645
What?

23:44.728 --> 23:48.149
You should be walking on air,
the way this shit turned out.

23:48.232 --> 23:49.901
The way what shit turned out?

23:49.984 --> 23:51.986
There's a dude going to jail because of me.

23:52.069 --> 23:56.323
Yeah... but at least you and Stumpy
get to limp off into the sunset.

23:56.407 --> 24:00.077
I can't even fucking look at him.

24:00.161 --> 24:02.204
And now everybody knows I'm pregnant.

24:02.288 --> 24:05.082
That is never gonna work.

24:05.166 --> 24:07.877
I'm so fucking stupid.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.753
Hey, it's all right.

24:09.837 --> 24:12.339
It's all right.

24:12.423 --> 24:17.094
A lot of people are stupid and
still live full, productive lives.

24:18.345 --> 24:19.721
At least you know you're getting paid.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.348
Paid?

24:21.432 --> 24:25.477
Oh, Jesus, girl, didn't
I teach you nothing?

24:25.561 --> 24:28.856
You get raped by a guard,
you get to sue the government.

24:28.940 --> 24:32.193
Plus, even better, you got a baby...

24:32.276 --> 24:37.281
which means child support from
Mendez and extortion money from Gimpy.

24:38.282 --> 24:40.367
I'm telling you, this rape...

24:40.451 --> 24:42.870
is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

24:42.954 --> 24:46.332
The only reason them bitches is
talking is because they jealous.

24:46.415 --> 24:50.920
And then what happens when
the baby ends up with no daddy?

24:51.003 --> 24:53.297
Another fucking barrio baby.

24:54.131 --> 24:57.218
You don't think about that.

24:57.301 --> 25:00.721
You was raised in a
non-traditional setting...

25:00.804 --> 25:02.932
and you turned out great.

25:03.015 --> 25:04.641
Thanks, Ma.

25:06.643 --> 25:08.312
Sure, no problem.

25:09.813 --> 25:12.984
Just remember me when them
checks start comin' in.

25:20.449 --> 25:22.576
An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison

25:22.659 --> 25:23.744
is attempting to contact you.

25:23.827 --> 25:26.413
To accept this call, please press one.

25:28.916 --> 25:30.751
So, in your letter,

25:30.834 --> 25:34.005
you claim you tried to ask if I
could get the same deal you got,

25:34.088 --> 25:36.215
but what you failed to explain is why

25:36.298 --> 25:39.260
after you coached me in exactly
what to say in my testimony,

25:39.343 --> 25:42.304
you suddenly do an about-face
and say the exact opposite thing.

25:42.388 --> 25:44.431
You want the long version
or the short version?

25:44.515 --> 25:47.518
I want the short version.
You have one minute.

25:47.601 --> 25:49.020
Oh.

25:50.021 --> 25:51.147
It's like that, huh?

25:51.230 --> 25:54.483
No, my... phone credit is running low.

25:55.692 --> 25:58.820
Look, Piper... I was
facing more time than you.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.448
My lawyer told me that my
testimony would put Kubra away...

26:01.532 --> 26:03.117
for sure...

26:03.200 --> 26:05.202
and that I could walk that same day.

26:05.286 --> 26:07.163
Congratulations.

26:07.246 --> 26:09.373
Your lawyer is a better
lawyer than Larry's dad.

26:09.456 --> 26:10.457
No, he isn't.

26:10.541 --> 26:12.626
He was wrong. Kubra walked.

26:12.709 --> 26:13.877
What?

26:14.878 --> 26:16.380
There was a mistrial.

26:16.463 --> 26:20.176
Some dumb fuck mishandled the evidence.

26:20.259 --> 26:21.260
He's out.

26:24.221 --> 26:25.973
So I'm the only one who went to prison?

26:26.057 --> 26:29.560
I tell you that Kubra's free
after I testify against him

26:29.643 --> 26:31.062
and that's all you have to say?

26:31.145 --> 26:32.771
Well, I mean, they're
protecting you, right?

26:32.854 --> 26:35.983
Yeah... they're protecting me.

26:36.067 --> 26:37.526
There's around-the-clock
surveillance.

26:38.235 --> 26:39.486
And by that, I mean...

26:39.570 --> 26:42.489
I see my probation officer
every week for about 20 minutes.

26:42.573 --> 26:44.908
Oh, my God.

26:44.992 --> 26:46.202
Alex...

26:46.285 --> 26:47.286
Alex, are you serious?

26:47.369 --> 26:49.663
- Where are you right now?
- Queens.

26:49.746 --> 26:50.831
You're in Queens?

26:50.914 --> 26:52.499
I was just there!

26:53.417 --> 26:54.418
What?

26:54.501 --> 26:56.253
Never mind. I can't
get into that right now.

26:56.337 --> 26:58.505
Alex, you shouldn't be in New York.

26:58.589 --> 27:02.343
Alex, you should be in fucking Nevada
or... or Argentina or something.

27:02.426 --> 27:04.470
That's fine.

27:04.553 --> 27:06.347
Thomas Pynchon hid in New York for years.

27:06.430 --> 27:09.725
And Queens isn't that bad.
No one comes to visit, but...

27:09.808 --> 27:11.893
it has pretty good Greek food.

27:13.270 --> 27:15.481
Besides, I'm not allowed
to leave the fucking state.

27:15.564 --> 27:16.732
It's part of my release.

27:16.815 --> 27:19.693
You have 30 seconds
remaining for this call.

27:19.776 --> 27:20.944
Oh, shit!

27:21.028 --> 27:24.991
You couldn't have added more
credit before calling me?

27:25.074 --> 27:26.200
I need to talk to you.

27:26.283 --> 27:27.701
Well, I didn't plan ahead.

27:27.784 --> 27:30.204
I need to talk to you in person.

27:30.287 --> 27:32.081
Can you get me on your visitation list?

27:32.164 --> 27:33.165
Well, I'll try, but, Alex,

27:33.249 --> 27:35.209
are you sure... are you
sure that you're safe?

27:36.502 --> 27:37.711
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:38.462 --> 27:41.632
Just... get me on your list
and we can talk about it then.

27:41.715 --> 27:42.966
Okay.

27:43.050 --> 27:45.344
Fuck! Motherfucker!

27:47.471 --> 27:49.015
You call that 30 seconds?

27:50.099 --> 27:52.059
Hey, that's federal property...

27:52.143 --> 27:53.894
You're federal property!

27:54.645 --> 27:55.729
Okay.

27:55.812 --> 27:58.232
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

27:58.315 --> 28:01.027
Menses, it's menses madness.

28:02.236 --> 28:04.321
Ew, just go.

28:20.837 --> 28:23.174
Come on, open up.

28:23.257 --> 28:25.092
I know you're in there. I saw you go in.

28:25.176 --> 28:26.593
What do you want?

28:26.677 --> 28:28.179
You know what I want.

28:28.262 --> 28:31.098
I want you to separate
your damn recyclables.

28:31.182 --> 28:33.350
And you can't keep leaving
cardboard boxes outside.

28:33.434 --> 28:35.102
You need to break 'em down first.

28:35.186 --> 28:36.187
I see you!

28:43.902 --> 28:46.697
- What?
- Oh, you're not Mrs. Woo.

28:46.780 --> 28:48.657
No, I'm not Mrs. Woo. I'm Alex.

28:48.740 --> 28:51.202
Hey, I'm Jay. I, uh...

28:51.285 --> 28:52.536
I deal with the garbage.

28:52.619 --> 28:55.164
I'm sorry about the boxes.
I'll break them down next time.

28:55.247 --> 28:57.291
That's all I ask.

28:57.374 --> 28:58.375
Welcome to the building.

28:58.459 --> 28:59.460
Yeah.

28:59.543 --> 29:01.670
Oh, Alex! Alex Vause?

29:01.753 --> 29:02.796
What?

29:02.879 --> 29:04.506
Some Arab guys were looking for you.

29:04.590 --> 29:07.176
Maybe not Arab, but you know...

29:08.052 --> 29:09.428
dusky gentlemen.

29:17.686 --> 29:19.813
Well, you're right.

29:19.896 --> 29:22.483
It was good you hid
the Aleut whaling spear.

29:22.566 --> 29:24.693
- Sorry.
- No...

29:24.776 --> 29:26.153
I'm glad I was here to tell him with you.

29:26.237 --> 29:30.199
I mean... it was the right thing
to do under the circumstances.

29:31.617 --> 29:34.328
Honestly, Pete is secretly
jumping up and down with joy

29:34.411 --> 29:35.537
to be let off the hook.

29:35.621 --> 29:38.790
He just needed to affirm his manhood.

29:38.874 --> 29:41.960
Maybe he can fuck Piper
and we'll have reciprocity.

29:42.043 --> 29:44.463
Well, Piper and I actually...

29:44.546 --> 29:46.006
actually ended in a good place.

29:46.090 --> 29:48.925
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

29:49.009 --> 29:53.013
I still need to work some
shit out with her, but...

29:53.097 --> 29:55.432
I'm glad you two are good.

29:58.769 --> 30:00.187
So that's it, huh?

30:01.021 --> 30:02.231
Piper knows...

30:03.064 --> 30:04.650
Pete knows.

30:06.277 --> 30:08.862
We're doing this.

30:08.945 --> 30:10.572
We're doing this.

30:12.783 --> 30:13.784
You can still leave.

30:13.867 --> 30:15.119
Leave? Why would I leave?

30:15.202 --> 30:17.413
I guess I don't know what you
get out of this relationship.

30:17.496 --> 30:19.498
And I'm scared, because...

30:19.581 --> 30:22.209
what happens when you wanna...
trek across an ice field?

30:22.293 --> 30:24.378
I can guarantee you...

30:24.461 --> 30:26.797
that I will never wanna
trek across an ice field.

30:26.880 --> 30:27.881
I know.

30:27.964 --> 30:29.049
You're so not rugged.

30:29.133 --> 30:30.967
That is not true.

30:31.051 --> 30:33.929
- I once did Israeli Army
summer camp. - Mmm-hmm.

30:34.012 --> 30:36.473
I shot Uzis in a desert with
a commander named Shmulik,

30:36.557 --> 30:39.560
so I can do rugged.

30:39.643 --> 30:40.894
It's the cold I don't like.

30:40.977 --> 30:42.688
Idiot.

30:42.771 --> 30:44.690
You know, you're the
only person I've ever met

30:44.773 --> 30:48.360
who can call me an idiot... without
actually making me feel like one.

30:48.444 --> 30:50.654
Maybe I'm using the wrong inflection.

30:55.659 --> 30:57.161
We all have feelings...

30:58.329 --> 31:00.414
and some feelings that
we feel are so strong

31:00.497 --> 31:05.336
that it's hard for us to be the person
that we know in our hearts that we can be.

31:05.419 --> 31:07.128
So what's the best way for us

31:07.213 --> 31:12.634
to deal with these kinds of
powerful and dangerous feelings?

31:12.718 --> 31:13.802
Let 'em have it.

31:14.511 --> 31:16.680
No... talk about them.

31:18.182 --> 31:19.808
If we talk about our problems,

31:19.891 --> 31:22.186
it makes it easier for
us to process our feelings

31:22.269 --> 31:25.397
and it helps us to realize
that we're not alone.

31:25.481 --> 31:27.441
Who'd like to start the sharing for today?

31:27.524 --> 31:28.525
Oh, me.

31:28.609 --> 31:30.151
Hold on.

31:31.528 --> 31:33.572
Hey, let's... let's start with Flores.

31:33.655 --> 31:36.116
- Me?
- Yeah.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.576
This is a talking stick.

31:38.994 --> 31:42.664
Whoever's gonna be talking in the
group will be carrying that stick.

31:43.665 --> 31:44.708
How do you feel?

31:46.042 --> 31:47.043
Good.

31:47.127 --> 31:48.379
Good?

31:48.462 --> 31:49.463
You're sure?

31:49.546 --> 31:50.881
Yeah...

31:50.964 --> 31:52.466
I feel very happy.

31:52.549 --> 31:55.093
Okay, the thing is...

31:56.345 --> 31:57.638
I don't believe you.

31:57.721 --> 32:00.056
And for Safe Place to work,

32:00.140 --> 32:02.976
you're gonna have to be really
honest about how you're feeling.

32:03.059 --> 32:06.438
Here... you wanna take a
look at the feelings chart?

32:11.568 --> 32:13.737
Okay.

32:14.655 --> 32:18.158
I feel... very depressed.

32:18.242 --> 32:19.993
- Good.
- Good?

32:20.076 --> 32:22.996
You just made her say that...
and now she feels crappy.

32:23.079 --> 32:24.080
Hey!

32:24.164 --> 32:26.875
Excuse me, you can't talk
without the talking stick.

32:26.958 --> 32:27.959
Why? You don't have one.

32:28.043 --> 32:29.878
Oh, doesn't apply to me.

32:29.961 --> 32:31.505
I'm the group facilitator.

32:31.588 --> 32:33.299
No... no, you're not.

32:33.382 --> 32:35.384
- I'm not?
- No.

32:35.467 --> 32:38.679
With that being said, I
want this place to be a place

32:38.762 --> 32:42.516
where you all feel free to talk
within the given guidelines.

32:44.268 --> 32:45.769
Tell you what...

32:46.770 --> 32:48.272
let's switch.

32:48.355 --> 32:51.149
- Here, you take the stick.
- No.

32:51.232 --> 32:53.234
- Come on.
- I... I don't got nothing to say.

32:53.319 --> 32:57.364
Sure you do. Just tell
us how you're feeling.

33:01.159 --> 33:02.202
Bored.

33:02.286 --> 33:03.537
Bored isn't a feeling.

33:03.620 --> 33:04.871
What do you mean, it's not a feeling?

33:04.955 --> 33:06.665
It's not on the feelings chart.

33:17.301 --> 33:18.635
Fine!

33:18.719 --> 33:22.222
Mad. I feel mad.

33:22.306 --> 33:23.557
Okay.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.683
And why do you feel mad?

33:24.766 --> 33:26.768
'Cause you told me I couldn't feel bored!

33:32.316 --> 33:33.900
Sorry.

33:33.984 --> 33:35.486
You're late.

33:35.569 --> 33:36.737
I thought it was in the chapel.

33:36.820 --> 33:38.029
Take a seat.

33:39.865 --> 33:42.283
Okay, Washington, you were saying?

33:44.661 --> 33:47.414
I wasn't saying anything.

33:47.498 --> 33:48.707
What is the point of this?

33:48.790 --> 33:50.334
To get a shot off your record.

33:50.417 --> 33:51.585
No...

33:51.668 --> 33:55.589
the point is to help you to start
to get in touch with your feelings.

33:57.215 --> 33:58.258
Did it ever occur to you that

33:58.342 --> 34:00.344
we don't wanna get in
touch with our feelings?

34:00.427 --> 34:03.597
That actually feeling our feelings

34:03.680 --> 34:05.974
might make it impossible
to survive in here?

34:06.057 --> 34:08.268
Look...

34:08.351 --> 34:09.936
I'm trying to look out for you.

34:10.020 --> 34:13.482
Everybody in here, we have
to look out for each other.

34:13.565 --> 34:15.567
Now you look like you
got hurt. What happened?

34:20.030 --> 34:21.239
Nothing happened.

34:23.449 --> 34:25.201
- What?
- Washington...

34:26.620 --> 34:29.790
what happens in Safe
Place stays in Safe Place.

34:29.873 --> 34:32.376
That's why it's called Safe Place.

34:33.543 --> 34:36.588
Nothing happened.

34:36.672 --> 34:38.507
I slipped in the shower.

34:40.050 --> 34:42.719
Totally random.

34:43.929 --> 34:45.472
We have a limited amount of time

34:45.556 --> 34:48.308
and the pressure needs
to come from outside.

34:48.391 --> 34:50.643
Who have you already talked to about this?

34:50.726 --> 34:52.813
I have some activist friends
I told to get the word out.

34:52.896 --> 34:55.774
- Who are they?
- Terry and Gus.

34:55.857 --> 34:58.151
Gus is a webmaster for
an anti-logging blog,

34:58.234 --> 35:01.822
and Terry runs a bakery that
sells anti-authoritarian cupcakes.

35:03.239 --> 35:06.117
Contact the Leadership
Conference of Women Religious,

35:06.201 --> 35:09.079
and the National Catholic
Social Justice Lobby.

35:09.162 --> 35:11.039
They can network with the major newspapers.

35:11.122 --> 35:14.835
Okay... okay... back up.

35:14.918 --> 35:15.919
I have to say something.

35:16.002 --> 35:18.839
I was told this is a leaderless movement,

35:18.922 --> 35:20.340
and I'm feeling uncomfortable

35:20.424 --> 35:24.845
with the fact that you're really...
I feel, acting like a leader.

35:24.928 --> 35:26.680
Because we all got ideas...

35:26.763 --> 35:28.682
but you were the last one to join up.

35:28.765 --> 35:30.601
Yeah, and I also feel that way.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.395
I'm sorry that you feel I've been...

35:34.480 --> 35:35.481
leader-y.

35:36.815 --> 35:39.192
Everyone's ideas are important.

35:39.275 --> 35:40.444
That's okay.

35:40.527 --> 35:42.278
- It's water under the creek.
- We forgive you!

35:42.362 --> 35:43.822
Long as you know...

35:43.905 --> 35:46.700
all our interests gots to be represented...

35:46.783 --> 35:48.494
'cause me and Angie got some new demands.

35:49.786 --> 35:53.499
- We would like more dessert options.
- Yeah!

35:53.582 --> 35:55.041
And field trips.

35:55.125 --> 35:58.545
And musical guests in the
prison, like Johnny Cash.

35:58.629 --> 36:00.213
Johnny Cash is dead.

36:01.172 --> 36:02.799
I want what I want.

36:04.300 --> 36:05.719
Oh, boy!

36:05.802 --> 36:08.680
You'll never believe this.
We ordered too many pizzas.

36:08.764 --> 36:10.682
- Mmm-hmm. -
Anybody want a slice?

36:10.766 --> 36:13.226
- That's dirty warfare.
- Uh, maybe...

36:13.309 --> 36:15.395
but that is one good-looking pie.

36:15.479 --> 36:17.939
- Leanne, Angie! What are you doing?
- Nothing.

36:18.023 --> 36:19.232
We're smelling it.

36:19.315 --> 36:21.610
We're just smelling it. That's allowed.

36:21.693 --> 36:24.780
It sure does smell good,
doesn't it? Little Caesars.

36:24.863 --> 36:27.574
It's the only thing better
than getting what you want.

36:27.658 --> 36:29.910
That should be their slogan.

36:29.993 --> 36:33.246
Why are we punishing ourselves
when we're already being punished?

36:33.329 --> 36:34.831
That makes no sense.

36:34.915 --> 36:37.584
Yeah, we could still say we're
not eating and nobody would know.

36:37.668 --> 36:38.960
Leanne...

36:39.044 --> 36:41.588
your mind is the enemy.
Don't listen to your mind...

36:41.672 --> 36:43.924
- Angie!
- I'm just licking it.

36:44.007 --> 36:45.216
A lick is all right.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.594
- It's all right. Let them eat.
- What?

36:47.678 --> 36:49.930
Go ahead, girls. Take a
break from your values.

36:50.013 --> 36:51.306
I am.

36:51.389 --> 36:52.933
That is another good slogan!

36:53.016 --> 36:55.060
What did you do that for?

36:55.143 --> 36:56.144
We don't need them.

36:56.227 --> 36:57.979
They confuse our message.

36:58.063 --> 36:59.856
They're half our movement!

36:59.940 --> 37:03.610
What happened to everyone's
ideas being important?

37:03.694 --> 37:06.530
- I changed my mind.
- Hey, look.

37:06.613 --> 37:08.073
I'm Edward Pizzahands.

37:11.451 --> 37:14.746
So when they arrest us...
that's 14 arrests for me.

37:14.830 --> 37:18.208
That's two more than Sister JoAnn,
and five more than Sister Patricia...

37:18.291 --> 37:21.127
even though she's the little darling
over there at Friends of the Earth.

37:21.211 --> 37:23.630
- That's not what's important.
- It's a bonus.

37:30.637 --> 37:32.305
I guess we should've brought more banners.

37:32.388 --> 37:34.641
I know. What a shitty day to do this.

37:34.725 --> 37:37.227
I mean, does anybody work here?

37:37.310 --> 37:38.311
Hello!

37:38.394 --> 37:40.230
- We're trespassing!
- Shh!

37:40.313 --> 37:42.691
Oh, Gene, take a picture.

37:46.778 --> 37:47.779
What's that?

37:47.863 --> 37:51.032
When Sister Patricia was
protesting the Portsmouth Plant,

37:51.116 --> 37:52.659
she threw a pint of blood.

37:52.743 --> 37:54.035
So what, you brought a quart?

37:54.119 --> 37:55.411
Two quarts.

37:55.495 --> 37:57.038
Fake. Costume blood.

37:57.122 --> 37:58.665
The blood that Sister Patricia threw

37:58.749 --> 38:01.793
was from an actual victim
of radiation poisoning.

38:01.877 --> 38:04.671
The pictures will look spectacular!

38:04.755 --> 38:06.006
What?

38:06.089 --> 38:07.966
I don't think you're doing
this in the right spirit.

38:08.049 --> 38:09.968
Don't talk to me about spirit.

38:10.051 --> 38:12.262
Without me, you're just a
couple of hippies on welfare.

38:13.054 --> 38:16.182
I'm the one who gives you
credibility, all right?

38:16.266 --> 38:17.267
You're ready, Gene?

38:17.350 --> 38:18.810
Get snapping.

38:26.652 --> 38:28.028
- Help!
- All right, pigs!

38:28.111 --> 38:30.614
Don't make another move
or the bitch gets it!

38:37.162 --> 38:39.039
What did you do that for?

38:39.122 --> 38:42.208
That's the drill. We don't
negotiate for hostages.

38:42.292 --> 38:43.627
So you let me kill her?

38:43.710 --> 38:45.295
Yeah, seriously, O'Neill?

38:45.378 --> 38:48.381
Okay, I'm pretty sure...
I knocked the gun away.

38:48.464 --> 38:50.717
I'm pretty sure she's still alive.

38:50.801 --> 38:52.260
No, I killed her.

38:52.343 --> 38:53.386
I shot her in the face.

38:53.469 --> 38:57.390
The bullet entered the left eye socket
and exited through the back of her head.

38:57.473 --> 38:59.309
There's blood and brains everywhere.

39:02.854 --> 39:04.272
Hey, Watson.

39:05.649 --> 39:07.150
Didn't mean to startle you.

39:08.401 --> 39:11.863
Just wanted to say I'm happy you're back.

39:16.827 --> 39:19.495
You know, one good thing
to come out of all this?

39:19.579 --> 39:24.000
It... got me motivated
to join the hunger strike.

39:26.002 --> 39:27.420
Do you know about that?

39:29.339 --> 39:31.842
I haven't eaten in a week.

39:34.177 --> 39:35.679
So what?

39:39.015 --> 39:40.892
Am I supposed to be grateful?

39:41.893 --> 39:44.938
I'm not here to make you feel
good about yourself, all right?

39:48.149 --> 39:50.777
You got guilt about something...

39:50.861 --> 39:52.696
that's not my problem.

39:53.780 --> 39:56.407
No, it's not anything like that.

39:56.491 --> 39:58.118
Look...

39:58.201 --> 40:01.872
I don't feel like being
your token black friend.

40:01.955 --> 40:04.540
So don't talk to me anymore.

40:07.543 --> 40:09.545
Okay.  Fine.

40:18.013 --> 40:20.807
Sure, baby... you know, I
can get you anything you want.

40:20.891 --> 40:24.477
'Cause around here, I'm like King
Bee, you know what I'm saying?

40:24.560 --> 40:25.979
Hey, Red.

40:26.062 --> 40:28.523
Aren't you usually playing
with the garden club about now?

40:28.606 --> 40:31.818
The greenhouse is closed
for a little while.

40:31.902 --> 40:35.155
There's a health hazard
that needs to be sorted out.

40:35.238 --> 40:36.614
Really? What?

40:36.697 --> 40:37.908
A rat.

40:40.410 --> 40:41.411
What the hell?

40:42.412 --> 40:44.497
Hey, take a walk, bouncy boobs.

40:45.331 --> 40:47.250
All right, none of you
bitches better come near me.

40:47.333 --> 40:50.378
Relax, we're not going to hurt you.

40:51.379 --> 40:52.964
Here.

40:53.924 --> 40:56.009
You asked for these.

40:56.092 --> 40:58.386
Enjoy them.

40:58.469 --> 41:02.140
It'll be the last favor I ever do for you.

41:03.724 --> 41:04.935
Oh.

41:05.018 --> 41:07.020
I'm out of the family.

41:07.103 --> 41:08.521
What a shame.

41:08.604 --> 41:09.773
Especially since our relationship

41:09.856 --> 41:12.067
has always involved such a
high degree of mutual respect.

41:12.150 --> 41:13.526
You need more love?

41:13.609 --> 41:14.861
I don't need shit.

41:14.945 --> 41:16.905
Fuck your Jolly Ranchers.

41:17.738 --> 41:21.367
There are houses on this
block with much better candy.

41:21.451 --> 41:24.537
You'd rather eat at Vee's table, would you?

41:24.620 --> 41:26.497
Yeah... so what?

41:26.581 --> 41:28.834
Does that make me some
kind of race betrayer?

41:28.917 --> 41:30.293
I mean, give me a fucking break.

41:30.376 --> 41:33.880
You come down here with your
scarecrows, trying to act all gangster?

41:33.964 --> 41:37.050
You buy loyalty with candy
and skin care products.

41:37.133 --> 41:41.346
I mean, your gang looks like a bunch
of half-price Garbage Pail Kids...

41:42.305 --> 41:45.641
Red... you're a fucking joke.

41:50.063 --> 41:52.065
You're right.

41:52.148 --> 41:54.692
I'm a joke.

41:54.775 --> 41:57.278
I'm sure you'll be better off on your own.

41:57.362 --> 41:59.197
I know I fucking will!

42:00.698 --> 42:02.658
Boo got Boo...

42:02.742 --> 42:04.535
and that's all Boo needs.

42:06.997 --> 42:08.081
Boo.

42:18.341 --> 42:19.509
Fuck.

42:25.515 --> 42:27.183
Thank you for making those.

42:27.267 --> 42:28.601
I should help.

42:28.684 --> 42:29.936
It's okay, I got it.

42:30.020 --> 42:32.397
You should conserve your energy.

42:35.483 --> 42:36.484
Queens, huh?

42:36.567 --> 42:38.694
I should hook her up with my buddy, Michel.

42:38.778 --> 42:41.572
He runs a strip joint
underneath the Queensboro Bridge.

42:41.656 --> 42:44.450
Well, it's full nude, but
they don't serve alcohol.

42:44.534 --> 42:46.827
It's just such a fucked situation.

42:46.912 --> 42:48.955
I know, man, that's the law.

42:49.039 --> 42:50.290
'Cause I... I guess some schmuck

42:50.373 --> 42:53.418
decided that nudity and booze at
the same time's just too much fun.

42:53.501 --> 42:55.295
It's probably a Mormon with six wives.

42:55.378 --> 42:57.255
I'm talking about Alex.

42:58.089 --> 42:59.674
She should be under witness protection.

42:59.757 --> 43:00.800
What do you care?

43:00.884 --> 43:02.802
I mean, didn't she screw
you over in Chicago?

43:02.886 --> 43:03.970
Oh, that's right.

43:04.054 --> 43:05.680
That's kind of how you
two relate, isn't it?

43:05.763 --> 43:08.433
It's like Spy vs. Spy, but sexual.

43:09.559 --> 43:11.644
You know something, this
guy, Kubra, he's no joke...

43:11.727 --> 43:13.563
and they know that.

43:13.646 --> 43:14.689
They're not taking responsibility

43:14.772 --> 43:16.482
for the fact that they
put her in harm's way.

43:16.566 --> 43:19.860
If it's not part of your deal,
it's just not part of your deal.

43:19.945 --> 43:23.823
Yeah, the system doesn't have a
conscience and nobody likes extra work.

43:23.907 --> 43:24.908
Oh, by the way...

43:24.991 --> 43:28.995
we're gonna be helping to put sandbags
around the lake in electrical this week.

43:29.079 --> 43:30.871
What? What does that have
to do with electrical?

43:30.956 --> 43:35.668
If the lake overflows during the
storm, then we all get electrocuted.

43:35.751 --> 43:37.170
I don't know.

43:37.253 --> 43:39.505
It's not like there's a sandbag department.

43:39.589 --> 43:43.759
Officer, confiscate those
markers, paper, posters, all of it.

43:43.843 --> 43:46.137
But these are just art supplies.

43:46.221 --> 43:48.431
They are a privilege that has been abused.

43:48.514 --> 43:51.017
It's not a privilege. It's a right!

43:51.101 --> 43:53.853
Careful, Sister, don't stand up too fast.

43:53.937 --> 43:55.563
We have freedom of speech.

43:55.646 --> 43:57.857
You did and then you broke the law.

43:57.941 --> 43:59.150
Where do you think you are?

44:00.485 --> 44:03.154
And as for this... no more.

44:03.238 --> 44:09.285
This little experiment in free expression,
Waldorf-style prison... is over.

44:10.996 --> 44:12.663
Fucking cunt.

44:14.332 --> 44:15.708
You didn't need to do that.

44:15.791 --> 44:18.044
You let 'em get a rise out
of you, gives them more power.

44:18.128 --> 44:20.964
Oh, is that what your mommy told
you when you were being bullied?

44:21.047 --> 44:23.133
A hunger strike, really?

44:23.216 --> 44:24.550
What should I be doing,
force-feeding them?

44:24.634 --> 44:26.094
- Why not?
- Because I can't.

44:26.177 --> 44:29.180
Unless they're unconscious. Then I
can do it if they don't have a DNR.

44:29.264 --> 44:30.890
Fine, then try and get
them while they're sleeping.

44:30.974 --> 44:34.185
We have a responsibility to feed
these women three square meals a day,

44:34.269 --> 44:36.396
and I am a defender of women.

44:36.479 --> 44:38.064
Do you want me to do anything else, sir?

44:42.027 --> 44:43.944
It's all right.

44:44.029 --> 44:46.114
It's gonna play itself out.

44:46.197 --> 44:48.241
An embarrassment?

44:48.324 --> 44:49.742
It should be a triumph.

44:49.825 --> 44:52.537
I... I was on the cover
of The New York Times.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.664
You see, that is exactly the issue.

44:54.747 --> 44:57.583
It's not about service
to God... it's about you.

44:57.667 --> 44:58.834
You're a narcissist.

44:59.752 --> 45:00.753
That's not true.

45:00.836 --> 45:01.837
No?

45:04.549 --> 45:08.511
You timed this protest to
coincide with your book release...

45:08.594 --> 45:10.763
and you didn't even
credit your ghostwriter.

45:10.846 --> 45:14.517
I'm giving all the proceeds to
charity. I'm doing God's work.

45:14.600 --> 45:17.228
Hey... you know what this stands for?

45:18.271 --> 45:19.647
Vatican II.

45:22.192 --> 45:24.277
Are you not happy being a nun?

45:25.236 --> 45:26.529
No!

45:26.612 --> 45:29.407
I love being a nun.

45:29.490 --> 45:33.619
If I seem prideful, it's only
because I love the work I do...

45:33.703 --> 45:35.621
and because I'm really good at it.

45:35.705 --> 45:37.873
By your own estimation.

45:37.957 --> 45:42.044
There is a page in your book
I'd like to read for you.

45:43.129 --> 45:46.882
"I have never heard
Christ clearly in my heart.

45:46.966 --> 45:50.553
"Either my heart's hard of hearing,
or Christ can be a bit of a mumbler...

45:51.304 --> 45:55.725
"and so I've learned to trust
in my own moral instincts."

45:56.851 --> 45:57.852
It's a joke.

45:59.895 --> 46:03.816
I'm comparing my marriage to Christ...

46:03.899 --> 46:05.401
to a typical marriage.

46:06.486 --> 46:08.154
"But it wasn't my moral instincts

46:08.238 --> 46:10.990
"that led me to Nicaragua
in the summer of '88.

46:11.073 --> 46:13.701
"It was a young freedom
fighter named Carlos."

46:13.784 --> 46:14.785
Okay...

46:14.869 --> 46:17.622
"With rock-hard abs under
his jungle fatigues...

46:17.705 --> 46:21.083
"Carlos was revolutionary
in more ways than one...

46:21.167 --> 46:25.963
"and overthrowing the Sandinistas
was not his only objective."

46:26.046 --> 46:30.301
Okay, now, that chapter's there
for the mommy book-club crowd.

46:30.385 --> 46:33.346
They need a little beefcake
with their politics.

46:33.429 --> 46:35.140
I'm sorry, Sister,

46:35.223 --> 46:38.184
but the church has decided we
can't support you any longer.

46:38.268 --> 46:40.019
Support me?

46:40.102 --> 46:42.021
You mean...

46:42.104 --> 46:43.648
you won't pay my legal fees?

46:43.731 --> 46:45.941
I mean we can't support you...

46:46.817 --> 46:48.110
period.

46:52.532 --> 46:54.242
What do you mean, she's not coming?

46:54.325 --> 46:57.077
She said she doesn't wanna do it anymore.

46:57.162 --> 46:58.871
And no more contraband either.

46:58.954 --> 47:00.290
But we just started.

47:00.373 --> 47:02.208
Is this about the black one?

47:02.292 --> 47:03.834
What? Fuck you!

47:03.918 --> 47:06.712
Not you. You're not one of the bad ones.

47:06.796 --> 47:08.088
She means Vee.

47:08.173 --> 47:11.884
Red would rather kill the
tunnel than let her take it.

47:11.967 --> 47:14.637
That's the one with the
big hair. I know her.

47:14.720 --> 47:17.056
But I love being in touch with the soil.

47:17.139 --> 47:18.724
I know.

47:18.808 --> 47:20.017
This club is the best thing

47:20.100 --> 47:22.603
that's happened to me since work exemption.

47:22.687 --> 47:26.191
Well, maybe Red isn't thinking straight.

47:26.274 --> 47:27.942
When the pirates are boarding,

47:28.025 --> 47:33.614
you don't sink the ship,
you fight the damn pirates.

47:33.698 --> 47:34.907
Say again?

47:34.990 --> 47:37.034
How 'bout I kill the bitch?

47:41.497 --> 47:45.585
Then we played a game called
Human Knot where we all held hands

47:45.668 --> 47:48.296
and tried to unknot the
knot without letting go.

47:48.379 --> 47:49.755
And Flores... she got...

47:49.839 --> 47:51.799
accidentally got tickled
and started laughing

47:51.882 --> 47:53.343
and then we all started
laughing and it was so...

47:53.426 --> 47:55.428
Sounds mad gay.

47:55.511 --> 47:57.305
Yeah,  it was mad gay.

47:57.388 --> 47:59.599
Yo, what y'all talking about?

47:59.682 --> 48:02.142
She went to keep an eye on
Poussey in Healy's thing.

48:03.769 --> 48:05.813
You didn't have to do that.

48:05.896 --> 48:07.440
I told you, she ain't no fink.

48:07.523 --> 48:09.442
You said that. But you know what?

48:09.525 --> 48:11.652
I'm not really sure where
your loyalties lie these days.

48:11.736 --> 48:12.862
What do you think, Suzanne?

48:12.945 --> 48:14.280
Well, I don't think she's gonna talk,

48:14.364 --> 48:19.034
but... I was a little disturbed by
her contribution to the group poem.

48:19.118 --> 48:21.704
It's a lot of anger. It's a lot of fear.

48:21.787 --> 48:24.123
Well, of course there
was with you right there.

48:24.206 --> 48:25.666
You would spook a vampire.

48:25.750 --> 48:28.628
If you would've had me go,
it would've been better.

48:28.711 --> 48:33.591
And if ifs and buts were candies and
nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas.

48:34.467 --> 48:36.886
And if snitches and bitches
were wine and beer...

48:36.969 --> 48:39.472
we'd all have a happy New Year. Am I right?

48:39.555 --> 48:42.099
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.

48:43.268 --> 48:48.063
Why do you keep defending
her over your family?

48:52.402 --> 48:53.903
I'm not.

48:55.655 --> 48:59.409
I... I just think she's
been through enough.

48:59.492 --> 49:02.412
But you don't have to worry
about her, Vee, for real.

49:03.913 --> 49:05.873
Fine, I don't worry.

49:05.956 --> 49:07.833
But from now on, she's your responsibility.

49:07.917 --> 49:10.545
Anything happens again...

49:10.628 --> 49:12.087
it's on you.

49:28.604 --> 49:30.105
What happened?

49:30.189 --> 49:31.691
She fainted.

49:31.774 --> 49:33.233
For a second.

49:33.318 --> 49:36.446
I'm not unconscious.

49:36.529 --> 49:39.031
I'm not unconscious.

49:39.114 --> 49:42.785
Sister, I talked to your compatriots.

49:42.868 --> 49:44.745
I think there's been a decision made.

49:44.829 --> 49:46.288
Let me guess.

49:47.415 --> 49:49.124
You gave up.

49:49.208 --> 49:53.338
It's just not safe
anymore... especially for you.

49:53.421 --> 49:55.214
That's an excuse.

49:55.297 --> 49:57.675
Did you contact the media like I asked you?

49:57.758 --> 49:59.552
I tried.

49:59.635 --> 50:03.222
Nobody took the bait with the
story. There's a storm coming.

50:03.305 --> 50:05.891
You're damn right there's a storm coming.

50:06.976 --> 50:08.394
No, I don't mean it that way.

50:08.478 --> 50:11.564
There's actually a big winter storm
that's dominating all the news.

50:11.647 --> 50:13.190
It's just bad timing.

50:14.525 --> 50:17.737
Wait a minute. Sister's a nun.

50:17.820 --> 50:19.279
You're telling me that's not a story?

50:19.364 --> 50:22.492
Yeah, it's less of one since
she's been excommunicated.

50:28.539 --> 50:29.582
Labels.

50:29.665 --> 50:34.044
They told me that... they'd reconsider
letting me back in the church

50:34.128 --> 50:36.839
if I showed contrition in prison, but...

50:38.466 --> 50:40.217
bad habits die hard.

50:42.595 --> 50:44.138
Bad habits. Get it?

50:46.223 --> 50:47.933
It's good to be back in the saddle.

50:48.017 --> 50:50.102
Yeah, well, unless you
get out of the saddle...

50:50.185 --> 50:52.062
you're gonna be riding
straight into medical seg...

50:52.146 --> 50:53.856
and I don't wanna have to do that.

50:53.939 --> 50:55.190
So let's call it a day, huh?

50:55.274 --> 50:57.443
I'll call it a day...

50:57.527 --> 51:01.697
when you make meaningful changes
to the way this prison is run.

51:01.781 --> 51:03.866
I can't do that.

51:03.949 --> 51:05.075
Didn't you hear what she said?

51:05.159 --> 51:07.202
There's no point.

51:07.286 --> 51:08.663
You're all alone.

51:08.746 --> 51:10.289
Nobody even knows you're doing this.

51:10.372 --> 51:12.041
You know.

51:16.712 --> 51:18.047
All right.

51:18.130 --> 51:19.590
Have it your way.

51:24.512 --> 51:26.556
Here she comes!

51:28.390 --> 51:31.310
Please, Sister, don't do this to yourself.

51:31.393 --> 51:33.312
I'm fine, Sophia.

51:33.395 --> 51:34.439
I feel good.

51:36.106 --> 51:38.484
Almost blissful.

51:38.568 --> 51:39.819
She's delirious.

51:43.573 --> 51:45.157
- Rock on, Sister.
- You're all right.

51:45.240 --> 51:46.408
Fight the power.

51:46.492 --> 51:47.577
She thinks she's a rock star.

51:47.660 --> 51:49.870
She is.

51:52.331 --> 51:54.667
Whatever happened to humility?

51:54.750 --> 51:56.376
Isn't that a virtue or something?

51:56.461 --> 51:58.504
One of the highest.

51:58.588 --> 52:01.674
People in power are always saying so.

52:14.937 --> 52:17.189
Mr. Healy, did you hear about the Bugle?

52:17.272 --> 52:18.649
I can't do anything about it.

52:18.733 --> 52:20.776
But it was so good.

52:20.860 --> 52:22.194
It really was.

52:22.277 --> 52:25.197
People were taking responsibility.
People were opening up.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.617
It's everything that
you wanted to see happen.

52:29.451 --> 52:31.996
- Chapman...
- I mean, as a... as a counselor...

52:32.079 --> 52:34.624
You're being transferred...

52:34.707 --> 52:35.833
to Virginia.

52:37.376 --> 52:38.669
What?

52:40.546 --> 52:43.382
I received a memo from the warden's office.

52:43.465 --> 52:48.428
Yeah, your name was included
on a list with 12 other girls.

52:49.722 --> 52:51.056
Is this because of the paper?

52:51.140 --> 52:53.267
Is this because I published
the strike demands?

52:53.350 --> 52:54.393
Is this Fig?

52:54.476 --> 52:56.771
It's not punitive.

52:56.854 --> 53:00.315
We shuffle prisoners around all the time.

53:00.399 --> 53:02.151
We're overpopulated.

53:04.153 --> 53:06.864
The fact that you're on a list...

53:06.947 --> 53:10.242
it's... just a random thing.

53:11.577 --> 53:12.578
When?

53:12.662 --> 53:14.204
Maybe in a week.

53:14.288 --> 53:17.917
They usually pick 'em up on Saturday.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.627
No, that's visitation day.

53:21.378 --> 53:23.589
Alex was gonna come visit me.

53:25.841 --> 53:28.678
I don't know if she can come before then.

53:30.179 --> 53:32.264
She said that she needs
to speak with me in person.

53:32.347 --> 53:36.185
Chapman... you're going down south.

53:38.688 --> 53:43.734
Not having closure with Alex Vause...
would be the least of your problems.

53:54.995 --> 53:57.832
How much longer? How much...

53:57.915 --> 54:00.292
how much longer with this level of noise?

54:00.375 --> 54:02.670
Probably a few hours.

54:02.753 --> 54:05.547
All right, as long as it gets done.

54:05.631 --> 54:06.841
It'll get done.

54:14.640 --> 54:17.810
I see B-Dorm bathroom is being fixed.

54:17.893 --> 54:19.394
That's right.

54:20.270 --> 54:22.815
Funny how things work out sometimes.

54:26.401 --> 54:27.402
Yo, Vee!

54:32.700 --> 54:37.079
I'm not with Red anymore,
so I'm... all yours.

54:37.162 --> 54:38.623
- Mine?
- Yeah.

54:38.706 --> 54:39.957
But why would I want you?

54:40.040 --> 54:42.877
I did right by you,
Vee. I gave you the 411.

54:42.960 --> 54:44.586
I don't like snitches.

54:58.183 --> 55:01.311
Why are you always so quiet?

55:03.188 --> 55:06.817
Why do I always have to do all the talking?

55:29.256 --> 55:31.926
What the... fuck did I do?

55:32.634 --> 55:35.971
What did I do?

55:43.228 --> 55:44.229
I'm awake.

55:44.313 --> 55:47.107
I'm awake. I'm awake!

55:47.900 --> 55:49.068
I'm awake!

55:49.151 --> 55:50.986
I'm awake!

55:52.321 --> 55:53.781
No, don't feed me!

55:53.864 --> 55:56.200
I did not give my permission!

55:56.283 --> 55:58.660
This is not right! It's not fair!

55:58.744 --> 56:01.163
No, please! Please!
