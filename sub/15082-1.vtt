01:00.147 --> 01:02.348
Good evening.

01:02.450 --> 01:04.864
Please join me here at the table.

01:10.758 --> 01:14.193
Don't mind Joseph.
The poor thing is a mute.

01:23.704 --> 01:26.739
I'm Irwin Tolwood,
this is my wife Maybell.

01:27.641 --> 01:29.210
Pleased to meet you.

01:29.310 --> 01:34.046
My name is Anna.
I am Madame Addison's assistant.

01:42.523 --> 01:44.920
What is that for?

01:45.692 --> 01:49.262
The Madame documents all of her sessions.

01:49.764 --> 01:51.999
Joseph there will be taking photographs

01:52.099 --> 01:54.667
and the phonograph will record sound.

01:55.369 --> 01:57.836
Now why does she do that?

02:00.307 --> 02:02.825
Curious things may happen here tonight.

(DOOR OPENS)

02:13.020 --> 02:14.817
Good evening.

02:14.917 --> 02:18.290
Thank you... for seeing us.

02:19.794 --> 02:23.128
I will do my very best to help you.

02:28.770 --> 02:33.138
Ahh... yes, a skeptic.

02:33.740 --> 02:35.076
I beg your pardon?

02:35.176 --> 02:39.678
I must ask that you put your
full faith in me during the session.

02:39.780 --> 02:43.917
Negativity and doubt can easily
taint the connection.

02:45.319 --> 02:47.822
I'll have faith if you
help us find our daughter.

02:47.922 --> 02:50.357
Irwin, please.

02:50.457 --> 02:53.091
ANNA: Please, take your seats.

02:58.799 --> 03:01.335
Did you bring what I asked for?

03:01.435 --> 03:05.506
Yes... we just didn't understand why.

03:05.606 --> 03:09.510
I need something that was
personal and dear to her.

03:09.610 --> 03:12.380
It simply helps me to make contact.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.684
Personal items strengthen
the spiritual bond.

03:17.551 --> 03:21.689
Well, I hope this will suffice.

03:22.089 --> 03:25.060
It's her favorite.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.367
(EERIE MUSIC CONTINUES)

03:37.204 --> 03:39.541
And your personal items?

03:47.481 --> 03:50.018
That will do just fine.

04:09.570 --> 04:12.540
She has her father's eyes.

04:15.943 --> 04:19.414
Why did you ask us
to come here so late tonight?

04:20.113 --> 04:22.916
Three o' clock is
the witching hour, my dear.

04:23.016 --> 04:27.488
The time of night when the barrier between
the living and the dead is thinnest.

04:28.588 --> 04:31.492
Are you trying to tell me
that my daughter is already dead?

04:31.592 --> 04:37.398
If we make direct contact with her,
there is a good chance she has passed.

04:41.001 --> 04:43.971
How long ago did she vanish?

04:44.271 --> 04:45.765
Three weeks.

04:45.865 --> 04:51.412
Throughout this session it is imperative
that we do not break the circle.

04:51.512 --> 04:53.981
If we do indeed make contact with her,

04:54.081 --> 04:57.918
only one of us shall speak at a time.

04:58.018 --> 05:04.091
You must ask questions
with a yes or no for an answer.

05:04.491 --> 05:07.095
One tap for no. (TAPS TABLE)

05:07.995 --> 05:11.319

13:24.424 --> 13:27.961
- This is beautiful.
- It looks like a giant doll house.

13:28.061 --> 13:31.966
Cannot believe you're making us move.
So, this is actually gonna happen?

13:32.766 --> 13:34.568
AIDEN: I like it already, let's take it.

13:34.668 --> 13:38.572
We haven't seen the inside yet. Who knows?
It could be filled with 1000 cats.

- How many more do we have to look at?
- JOHN: As many as it takes till we find one.

13:43.944 --> 13:46.813
Do you really think
there are 1000 cats in there?

13:46.913 --> 13:49.383
No, Aiden, he was joking.

13:49.483 --> 13:51.919
Huh, the ad did say 3:00 o'clock.

13:52.019 --> 13:55.022
I don't think you could even have picked
an older house to look at, Dad.

13:55.122 --> 13:57.524
Look, it's like collapsing right there.

13:57.624 --> 14:01.963
- Well, with age comes character.
- The sign does say open house.

- This is nice.
- It's actually not that bad.

I'm so sorry. Aiden apologize to the lady.

14:22.883 --> 14:25.085
I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't see you there.

14:25.285 --> 14:27.921
Please, call me Claire.
Really, it's quite all right.

14:28.021 --> 14:30.523
I should have been waiting
for you near the front door.

14:30.623 --> 14:33.026
But I was watching the cookies
in the oven.

14:33.126 --> 14:35.261
He can be a handful sometimes.

looking at the house.

CLAIRE: The house is old,
but it was built to last.

18:23.323 --> 18:25.859
Well, it's a bit more house
than I was expecting.

18:25.959 --> 18:29.195
CLAIRE: I think it fits right
into your price range.

18:29.295 --> 18:34.307
- How do you know my price range?
- Well, I assume you read the ad.

18:34.734 --> 18:37.337
Yeah, what's the catch?

18:37.437 --> 18:39.172
The door bell needs repair.

18:39.272 --> 18:42.409
Seriously, a house this size
for that price?

18:42.509 --> 18:44.311
Cookie?

18:44.411 --> 18:46.980
No, I'm trying to drop some.

18:47.080 --> 18:51.351
Quite honestly, the city wants
the house to sell before it wears.

18:51.451 --> 18:54.989
May I ask about your wife?
Will she be joining us?

18:55.489 --> 18:59.726
Um, she recently passed.
It still doesn't seem very real.

19:00.226 --> 19:03.887
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:04.395 --> 19:06.663
- When did she...
- Three months ago.

19:06.763 --> 19:11.938
It seems like just yesterday she
was here and now she's gone so...

19:13.338 --> 19:19.228
Well, God tests us in the toughest
ways sometimes, doesn't he?

19:19.328 --> 19:20.613
That explains the move then?

19:20.713 --> 19:24.217
Yeah, I figured a fresh environment
would be good for the kids.

19:24.317 --> 19:26.052
Well, you made the right decision.

19:26.152 --> 19:31.491
The schools in this neighborhood,
fantastic!

19:31.591 --> 19:34.995
I think this house
will do well for your family.

19:35.095 --> 19:37.197
- AIDEN: I get that room.
- VICTORIA: You wish.

19:37.297 --> 19:40.567
Hey, right on time.

19:41.134 --> 19:42.969
JOHN: Just one, guys.

19:43.069 --> 19:45.105
- Maybe two.
- JOHN: What do you say?

19:45.205 --> 19:47.132
Thanks.

19:47.232 --> 19:49.275
You're welcome.

19:53.213 --> 19:57.217
Hey! Easy with the stuff, guys. Jesus.

20:12.332 --> 20:14.200
- Nope.
- What the hell?

20:14.300 --> 20:15.902
I told you I don't want
to see you smoking.

20:16.002 --> 20:18.271
I'm not a baby anymore, Dad,
I can do whatever I want.

20:18.371 --> 20:21.442
Honey, I only want what's best for you.

20:21.942 --> 20:25.514
Then maybe moving me away from all of
my friends right after my mom died,

20:25.614 --> 20:28.024
- wasn't such a good idea, huh?
- Sweetheart.

20:28.124 --> 20:30.189
We're all in this together.
I'm gonna need your support.

20:30.289 --> 20:35.155
- I'm gonna need you to be a little bit...
- Just... please just... leave me alone.

- Does this look like the kitchen?
- I was just taking a break. Sheesh.

21:09.889 --> 21:13.261
- Isn't this great?
- I love it.

21:14.661 --> 21:18.765
I still don't understand
why we had to leave the old house.

21:18.865 --> 21:20.800
Well, we talked about this, hun.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.936
I think this move is gonna be
the best thing for all of us.

21:24.036 --> 21:26.444
- You'll get used to it.
- It's kind of creepy.

21:26.544 --> 21:28.809
- Scaredy cat.
- I'm not scared.

21:28.909 --> 21:33.180
I think all it needs is a good cleaning
and some fixing up.

21:34.914 --> 21:37.450
I'm gonna have this place
looking tip-top in no time.

21:37.550 --> 21:39.352
How do you feel about
Chinese food for dinner?

21:39.452 --> 21:41.788

Tell you what, why don't you get up and help?

21:57.437 --> 22:00.841
- AIDEN: Nah, I'm fine.
- Aiden, get up and help.

22:01.341 --> 22:03.575
No, that's okay.

22:03.675 --> 22:07.948
I mean, at this rate, who knows how long
it's gonna take to get to his room, huh?

22:08.048 --> 22:10.550
- Mr. Non-helper?
- No, I'll help. I'll help.

22:10.650 --> 22:13.253
Give me the cards, I'll show you a trick.

22:13.353 --> 22:16.288
- Dad?
- Yup.

22:16.388 --> 22:18.792
Can we hang this up?

22:22.428 --> 22:25.002
I think that's a good idea.

22:25.102 --> 22:27.508
Where should we put it?

22:28.208 --> 22:31.638
Somewhere we can all see it everyday.

22:35.675 --> 22:38.111
How about...

22:38.311 --> 22:40.480
Above the couch?

22:40.580 --> 22:42.449
That's perfect.
