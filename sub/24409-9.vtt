01:21.931 --> 01:24.068
When Nicole
and Jenni announced

01:24.103 --> 01:26.344
that they're gonna go home for
a few days to see their kids,

01:26.379 --> 01:27.724
I kind of am happy about it.

01:27.758 --> 01:29.310
We're gonna have less
complaining

01:29.344 --> 01:30.655
and nagging in the house.

01:30.689 --> 01:32.551
They can get that
out of their system

01:32.586 --> 01:35.551
and then return to Miami
with a clearer head and happy.

01:35.586 --> 01:37.448
I figure we can go to Mokai
tomorrow night.

01:37.482 --> 01:38.931
Dude, that's tomorrow night.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.172
The girls are going
back home to see their kids,

01:41.206 --> 01:44.000
so I'm realizing right now
that we're stuck with Deena.

01:44.034 --> 01:45.275
I don't know, dude.

01:45.310 --> 01:46.965
Why are you being
like a weirdo?

01:49.206 --> 01:50.620
We all know what happened
with Deena.

01:50.655 --> 01:52.724
The last time she came out with
us, she turned into "Mean-a."

01:55.137 --> 01:57.000
She was falling.

02:00.275 --> 02:01.689
She was crying.

02:04.448 --> 02:06.068
We don't want that
on guys' weekend,

02:06.103 --> 02:08.724
so we need to figure out
what to do with Deena.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.310
Boys' meeting real quick.

02:10.344 --> 02:11.931
We've got to get
Deena out of here.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.551
You've seen
what happened at Shock.

02:13.586 --> 02:14.689
Do you want that
all weekend?

02:14.724 --> 02:15.931
Definitely not.

02:15.965 --> 02:17.068
We should put her
on a flight back to Jersey

02:17.103 --> 02:18.931
so she can see Chris.Oh, hell, yeah.

02:18.965 --> 02:20.655
We'll surprise her.
She'll be happy.

02:20.689 --> 02:24.000
We win, she wins.
Win, win.
Okay.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.965
We've got to think of like
a funny way to tell her, too.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.551
Yeah.Let's write her a note.

02:30.241 --> 02:31.413
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31.448 --> 02:32.482
Let's write her a note.

02:32.517 --> 02:33.724
She would fall
for the bait, too.

02:33.758 --> 02:34.793
Hell, yeah.

02:34.827 --> 02:36.275
Operation: Boys' Weekend.

02:36.310 --> 02:38.517
Boys' weekend, fellas,
Just the boys, fellas.

02:38.551 --> 02:42.586
Operation: Boys' Weekend
is officially in full effect.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.413
She might fall,
going through security.

02:44.448 --> 02:46.034
I'm just warning, if you want
to write it on her ticket,

02:46.068 --> 02:48.206
but she could...
She will make it through.

02:48.241 --> 02:51.068
You know, I forgot,
she actually just got married,

02:51.103 --> 02:52.965
so it's Buckner,
not Cortese.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Yeah. B-U-C-K...

02:56.034 --> 02:59.137
"N" as in "Nancy,"
"E" as in "Edward," "R"...

02:59.172 --> 03:01.103
"R" as in "Rudolph,"
the red-nosed reindeer.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.896
"R" as in "Rudolph,"
the red-nosed reindeer.

03:04.965 --> 03:06.586
You don't have to write
the "Rudolph,

03:06.620 --> 03:07.862
the red-nosed reindeer" part.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.034
We're all taking our part

03:09.068 --> 03:10.586
into making this
Operation: Boys' Weekend.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.793
You know, we're planning
the flights.

03:12.827 --> 03:14.206
You know,
I'm writing the note.

03:14.241 --> 03:15.275
Wait, wait.

03:15.310 --> 03:16.793
Ron, you can write?

03:16.827 --> 03:18.896
Oh!

03:18.931 --> 03:21.793
Ron writing a note.
Hello, irony.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.241
Welcome home
to the Shore house.

03:24.275 --> 03:26.310

"Lord of the Rings" up in here.

Vacuuming sucks.

03:35.655 --> 03:38.620
I want us to come back to
like a nice, clean place.

03:41.482 --> 03:42.896
Yeah, it's like brewing.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.586
Good for you.

03:44.620 --> 03:47.206
Oh! It's gonna be
the worst.

03:47.241 --> 03:48.620
Come here. I just
want to talk to you.

03:48.655 --> 03:50.413
Let's go in your bedroom,
'cause I feel like

03:50.448 --> 03:51.689
you need to sit down
for this.

03:51.724 --> 03:53.724
Why? You're scaring me.

03:53.758 --> 03:56.931
Oh, my God. Like, who died?
Like, what's happening?

03:56.965 --> 03:59.172
Obviously, you have friends
in Jersey and stuff,

03:59.206 --> 04:01.034
and I got a phone call
this morning.

04:01.068 --> 04:02.241
Wait, what?

04:02.275 --> 04:04.758
And then I found this.

04:04.793 --> 04:07.103
Whenever there's a note
involved, I mean,

04:07.137 --> 04:09.551
it can't be good.
It's usually bad news.

04:09.586 --> 04:12.275
So I'm hoping that they're
just  with her,

04:12.310 --> 04:13.482
because she will die.

04:13.517 --> 04:15.724
Oh, .
You gave it to her, son?

04:15.758 --> 04:17.517
Our note is gonna be
pretty good,

04:17.551 --> 04:19.517
but it's not gonna top
the original note.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.655
The original note
is like the Bible.

04:22.689 --> 04:24.448
You can't rewrite that.

04:24.482 --> 04:27.241
"Dear Deena Buckner,
the first night you left,

04:27.275 --> 04:29.758
"Chris went to Mr. East

04:29.793 --> 04:32.344
"and he was grinded on
multiple meatballs.

04:32.379 --> 04:34.517
"He motorboated
multiple meatballs.

04:34.551 --> 04:36.310
"We just thought
you should know.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.620
This was really appalling."

04:38.655 --> 04:41.896
Ron is a stugots when it
comes to writing a note.

04:41.931 --> 04:45.137
"This is a note,
not a joke."
What?

04:45.172 --> 04:49.172
Stugots is an Italian way
to say, "you  idiot."

04:49.206 --> 04:50.793
Chris would never do that.

04:50.827 --> 04:53.655
Why are you lying?
You're starting .

04:53.689 --> 04:56.000
What is happening and why
am I getting this note

04:56.034 --> 04:58.586
and who wrote it? Because
the grammar is terrible.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.137
Like, we're about to leave.All right, then, fine.

05:00.172 --> 05:01.275
Then we're talking
, then.

05:01.310 --> 05:02.551
All right, so we're
talking .

05:02.586 --> 05:04.241
Ronnie didn't do so good
writing his note.

05:04.275 --> 05:06.448
He spelled it all wrong.
It was horrible.

05:06.482 --> 05:07.620
It was like having a
five-year-old write this note.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.655
I should have wrote this note.

05:08.689 --> 05:09.793
Chris doesn't even
talk to girls.

05:09.827 --> 05:11.344
All right.
Why are you yelling at us?

05:11.379 --> 05:13.000
Don't shoot the messenger.Chris stays home
and plays video games.

05:13.034 --> 05:14.724
I'm just
relaying the message.

05:14.758 --> 05:16.034
Who called you?

05:16.068 --> 05:18.206
My friend from Jersey.
Who?

05:18.241 --> 05:20.379
And who's that? 'Cause
I'm about to go to Jersey.

05:20.413 --> 05:21.896
Brian.
Brian what?

05:21.931 --> 05:23.586
Brian who?
Buckner.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.931
How old is he?

05:24.965 --> 05:26.758
She wasn't buying it.
Nobody was buying it.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.310
They actually wrote
another note.

05:28.344 --> 05:30.137
Yeah. This gets...

05:30.172 --> 05:31.896
It's more of the note
before the note.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.448
This gets even worse.You guys are rude.

05:33.482 --> 05:34.620
Stop.

05:34.655 --> 05:36.620
"Just kidding. You're
going to Jersey."

05:42.931 --> 05:44.137
Why are you crying?

05:44.172 --> 05:46.137
I'm crying just
because I'm so happy.

05:46.172 --> 05:47.482
I thought I was staying here

05:47.517 --> 05:49.379
with these fricking guys
all weekend.

05:49.413 --> 05:52.241
Now I am so excited
to see my family.

05:52.275 --> 05:53.310
We got you on the same
flight as them.

05:53.344 --> 05:54.482
Yep.

05:54.517 --> 05:56.034
Girl, you better
start packing.

05:56.068 --> 05:58.172
Start packing.
We gotta go.

05:58.206 --> 06:00.965
Yo, so we pulled off
the most epic note.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.482
"He was grinded"?

06:02.517 --> 06:05.448
This doesn't even make sense.
Who wrote this?

06:05.482 --> 06:06.655
Wait.Prank wars.

06:06.689 --> 06:07.827
Second most epic note.

06:07.862 --> 06:08.931
Nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah, nah,

06:08.965 --> 06:10.379
nah, nah, nah, nah,
nah, nah.

06:10.413 --> 06:14.275
"This was really appalling."

06:14.310 --> 06:15.793
Who even wrote that?

06:15.827 --> 06:17.379
"This was really appalling."

06:17.413 --> 06:19.137
Were we that bad when
we wrote the note?

06:19.172 --> 06:22.034
No, our note was, like,
grammatically correct.

06:22.068 --> 06:25.103
The boys gave Deena
a ticket to go home.

06:25.137 --> 06:29.137
This is amazing. But this
letter is so poorly done,

06:29.172 --> 06:31.551
they should have came to
the number one letter writer.

06:31.586 --> 06:32.827
You guys excited to go home?

06:32.862 --> 06:33.896
Yeah.
Yes.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.482
Am I home yet

06:35.517 --> 06:36.827
Yep, let's do it.

06:36.862 --> 06:38.172
Yo, you guys handling
the food for us?

06:38.206 --> 06:39.689
Bro, you don't worry about
a thing, bro, all right?

06:39.724 --> 06:41.551
You just worry
about being a guido.

06:41.586 --> 06:42.965
I don't worry about that.
It comes natural.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.793

I blocked you because
there was an article

It said something like,

38:42.413 --> 38:45.000

38:45.034 --> 38:46.620

I slept with you.

We hooked up, but we
never slept with each other.

38:50.931 --> 38:52.551
Exactly.
But you did say
he had a small .

38:52.586 --> 38:53.689
I said that you... yeah.

38:53.724 --> 38:56.034

100% I said it about you.
I never said I slept

38:58.068 --> 38:59.931

that you had, yeah.

I was like, listen,
that's  up.

39:01.379 --> 39:03.310
We had hooked up in the past,
but she never ,

39:03.344 --> 39:04.862
you know what I mean?
Therefore,

39:04.896 --> 39:07.000
I didn't like the fact that
she was making  up,

39:07.034 --> 39:08.413
but I understand
you were pissed.

that Angelina

39:10.827 --> 39:12.379
is saying
he has a small penis.

piece but you've never seen it,

39:14.931 --> 39:16.896

such a judgment call?

39:16.931 --> 39:18.034

39:18.068 --> 39:20.931
Like, it's a tiny, tiny,
tiny problem.

with you or had sex with you.

Okay, okay, fine,
fine, fine, fine.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.827

39:55.413 --> 39:57.310

kind of made me...

40:03.724 --> 40:05.379

40:05.413 --> 40:06.965
Yeah, no,
but at the same time...

40:07.000 --> 40:08.862
You've got to admit it.
I was a dick to you.

40:08.896 --> 40:10.551

And you were
a real dick to me.

40:10.586 --> 40:12.241

40:13.896 --> 40:16.034
Where is Mike and what
have you done with him?

40:16.068 --> 40:20.137
Because this is not the Mike
that I remember. Holy .

40:20.172 --> 40:23.793

how are the girls gonna be?

40:23.827 --> 40:25.896
They'll be fine.Everybody grew up now.

40:25.931 --> 40:28.655
We drank a couple
bottles of wine.

40:28.689 --> 40:30.551
You think they're
gonna try to fight me?

40:30.586 --> 40:32.793
If you have the same attitude
you have now, they'll be fine.

40:32.827 --> 40:37.206
Jenni, Nicole, Deena, they're
grown up. They're more mature.
