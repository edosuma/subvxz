Because you said you were
feeling a certain kinda way,

00:30.117 --> 00:31.292
which you told me.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.641

00:36.645 --> 00:38.299
We got a family emergency.

Oh, wow.

It just happened, right?

It's official now?

00:42.912 --> 00:44.044
Martell and I...

00:49.701 --> 00:50.920
He tried to DM me.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.269
So, he tried to DM you.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.140
I don't care if I was
trying to you.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.271
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

- I'm good.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.089
What you-- what you doing
looking this good for, huh?

01:29.089 --> 01:30.394
I knew you were coming.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.179
What's going on?

01:32.179 --> 01:34.355
Wait, how did everything go
with "Upscale" magazine?

01:34.355 --> 01:35.747
- It went good.
- It went good?

01:35.747 --> 01:37.184
- Yeah. Um--
- You look great.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.881
You look handsome.
- Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.143
You been workin' out?

01:40.143 --> 01:41.405
Yes, I was waiting on you.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.277
I thought we was gonna
work out together.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.105
I met Martell through
a mutual friend.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.063
He's on a reality show.

01:47.063 --> 01:49.413
We really enjoy
each other's company.

01:49.413 --> 01:50.893
You ain't been sweating.
Look at that.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.590
Shut up. Shut up.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.375
Martell lives
in Huntsville, Alabama,

01:54.375 --> 01:57.117
but I would love
for Martell to move closer.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.728
Since we met, I have seen
Martell every weekend.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.208
Hey, Martell.

02:01.208 --> 02:03.558
Um, Sheree, anything
you wanna say to your guy?

02:03.558 --> 02:04.820
Oh!

02:04.820 --> 02:06.735
I'll call you later.
All right. Bye-bye.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.084
Oh, my God!

02:08.084 --> 02:09.477
Did you work out for real?

02:09.477 --> 02:10.956
I thought you was waitin'
on me. Yeah, I love it.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.175
I'm gonna work out, again.
I'm gonna do two-a-day.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.568
You're looking good, though.

02:13.568 --> 02:14.743
I'm down for it.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.223
Despite what you see on TV,

02:16.223 --> 02:18.268
he's never shown me
anything but respect,

02:18.268 --> 02:21.837
and I'm really happy
that I didn't give up on love,

02:21.837 --> 02:23.099
that I left the door open.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.275
Do, I look stupid
as ,

02:25.275 --> 02:27.756
crazy as ,

02:27.756 --> 02:29.149
dumb as .

02:29.149 --> 02:30.585
Why are you here today?
No apology, no nothin',

02:30.585 --> 02:31.977
that you left me sitting there?
- Apologize?

02:31.977 --> 02:33.327
Why would I apologize
for somethin' that you did

02:33.327 --> 02:34.937
to go-- help me
go back to prison?

02:34.937 --> 02:36.373
I was----ing humiliated.

02:38.070 --> 02:39.246
I didn't say that.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.250
Yeah, it's still open.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.774
You're trying to get me.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.603
Who is that?

02:48.603 --> 02:49.952
I don't know.
We're gonna see.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.214
We're gonna see.
- Oh.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.346
Let me go see.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.956
Go get dressed.
- All right.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.958
Hi. How are you?

02:55.958 --> 02:57.133
Hey, I'm good,
and you look good.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.221
You're doing good?
Thank you.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.614
Hello.
Just come in and get to it.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.137
Yes.
- Hey, girl.

03:01.137 --> 03:03.618
Y'all are about to have some
Creole Cajun food tonight.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.620
- Okay, okay.
- Seafood egg rolls.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.882
- Okay.
- And then we're gonna have,

03:06.882 --> 03:08.536
uh, blackened salmon
with whipped potatoes

03:08.536 --> 03:10.190
and asparagus
for dinner tonight.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.148
Physical features
about Martell, like,

03:12.148 --> 03:13.932
okay, like, what is there
not to like?

03:13.932 --> 03:15.151
I love his physique.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.326
I like to lay
on that chest, honey.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.285
I like to grab on them arms
and that--

03:18.285 --> 03:20.417
the shoulders,
and, all that good stuff.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.246
And, of course,
Martell definitely exudes...

03:23.246 --> 03:24.726
big dick energy.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.818
Oh, Lord.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.303
Well, well, well.
- What's up? What's up?

03:36.303 --> 03:37.478
What took you so long?

03:37.478 --> 03:39.523
Okay, so,
let's get with the salmon.

03:39.523 --> 03:43.701
- So, this was the surprise?
- Yeah.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.095
Oh, Lord...
I ain't gonna tell you

03:46.095 --> 03:48.010
what I thought
the damn surprise was.

03:48.010 --> 03:49.577
What you thought
the surprise was?

03:49.577 --> 03:51.056
Somethin' good.
I don't know.

03:51.056 --> 03:52.493
This ain't good?

03:52.493 --> 03:53.711
And then I peeked over
and saw a woman at the door.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.365
I was like,
what kinda surprise is this?

03:55.365 --> 03:56.845
- Oh! Oh!
- Already?

03:58.629 --> 04:00.501
I actually considered,
uh, having a threesome

04:00.501 --> 04:04.244
with my ex-husband,
but we never did it.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.419
The funny thing is,

04:05.419 --> 04:06.985
he actually did it
with somebody else.

04:08.422 --> 04:10.337
I told you about
Sanya and Ross's

04:10.337 --> 04:11.425
40th birthday party.
- Oh, yeah.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.470
We're having a par-tay!

04:13.470 --> 04:14.906
Well, do you need
help with anything?

04:14.906 --> 04:17.169
No. At this point,
I feel good about everything.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.910
I just need you
to show up.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.695
Who all gonna be there?

04:20.695 --> 04:21.826
So, all the girls,

04:21.826 --> 04:25.221
um, Kandi,

04:25.221 --> 04:26.701
after she said
all that stuff.

04:26.701 --> 04:27.876
She said
I was a opportunist.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.094
Yeah.

04:29.094 --> 04:31.619
She's being used
for publicity.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.970
I-I guess you forgot
what opportunist was.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.406
- What?
- Your husband.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.842
Oh, oh! I think they'll be
respectful in-person.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.236
Aren't they, like,
three feet tall, both of 'em?

04:40.236 --> 04:41.759
They better be
goddamn respectful.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.154
It's so good.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.373
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.419
Have you talked to Kenya?

04:49.419 --> 04:50.942
Yeah, yeah,
she'll be happy to see you.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.815
I promise you, in probably
every text, "How's Martell?"

04:53.815 --> 04:55.338
We never met, have we?
I never met her.

04:55.338 --> 04:58.559
No, but I think they like
the fact that I like you.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.952
The wine got me a little bit.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.214
I know. Me, too.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.520
You're down for it,
ain't you?

05:03.520 --> 05:07.263
I need to do a Only Fans.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.917
Yeah, subscribing
to your channel.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.005
Ooh.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.267
Rarr!

05:20.015 --> 05:22.365
Anyways, how is everything
going on with you, ma'am?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.062
Everything is great.

05:24.062 --> 05:25.412
Business is excellent.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.152
I love it.
- Awesome.

05:27.152 --> 05:29.807
This feels déjà vu-ish
but different.

05:29.807 --> 05:30.982
Right.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.201
The Kandi Koated clique!

05:32.201 --> 05:33.768
We have not--
clique is back.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.292
At Kandi Koated,
you are like family.

05:36.292 --> 05:37.728
- She's like--
- I need y'all to work,

05:37.728 --> 05:39.600
but y'all are like family.
- Like family.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.993
- Y'all miss me?
- Of course, I miss you.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.473
She got new friends.
She don't miss you.

05:43.473 --> 05:44.779
Oh.

05:44.779 --> 05:47.129
- What new friends?
- Sanya, Drew.

05:47.129 --> 05:49.436
Are you really trying
to be funny, right now?

05:49.436 --> 05:51.263
Have you talked
to Sheree?

05:51.263 --> 05:52.308
No, we haven't talked.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.875
She's not selling anything.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.138
- The big disappointment--
- Like, the whole depression,

05:56.138 --> 05:57.661
the big disappointment.

05:57.661 --> 05:58.793
I'm looking at it,
right now,

05:58.793 --> 06:01.578
and the website
is shutdown, again.

06:01.578 --> 06:02.666
Now, people look at that,
and they think

06:02.666 --> 06:03.667
that I'm, you know,
they're like,

06:03.667 --> 06:04.973
"Oh, that's not
a good thing."

06:04.973 --> 06:05.408
Have that many people
ever came to your site

06:05.408 --> 06:08.977
to crash it?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.152
So, I'm-I'm blessed.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.545
I'm-I'm happy for that.

06:11.545 --> 06:14.983
That was the thing.
We tried to help her.

06:14.983 --> 06:18.334
She didn't wanna pay nobody.
You know what I'm sayin'?

06:18.334 --> 06:19.422
What do you wanna do?

06:19.422 --> 06:20.815
You just don't wanna
do nothin'.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.469
My girl, Sheree,
I love her very much,

06:22.469 --> 06:25.733
but when it comes to
the business aspect of things,

06:25.733 --> 06:28.823
she's just never
quite prepared.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.433
She's always like,
"Oh, I already know.

06:30.433 --> 06:33.175
"I have people."
You know, all of that,

06:33.175 --> 06:34.872
and then this happens.

06:36.308 --> 06:40.008
So, Kandi Koated Nights
is coming back.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.531
Oh, yeah.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.446
For it to work,
we're gonna have to make sure

06:43.446 --> 06:46.144
we map this out 'cause--
- Right.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.755
I was talking
to Ace last night,

06:47.755 --> 06:51.846
and Ace was like, "Mommy,
you work so much."

06:51.846 --> 06:56.503
And I'm like that's crazy for
a six-year-old to say that.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.983
What's wrong?

07:02.247 --> 07:05.425
Okay.
Aunt Cat can't help you?

Oh, oh, oh, here we go.
Here we go. Here we go.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.532
Why she make you mad,
Kandi?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.491
I already know.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.755
She sat up there
with damn Marlo ass.

08:14.755 --> 08:18.541
Kandi interrupted and said,
"You gave your nephews away."

08:18.541 --> 08:20.456
Yes, and maybe
y'all both vow

08:20.456 --> 08:22.023

there, again.

08:22.023 --> 08:25.156
I have been knowing my girl,
Kandi, for a very long time,

08:25.156 --> 08:27.942
so I did feel
some type of way

08:27.942 --> 08:29.944
when she thought that
I was agreeing with Marlo.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.598
She knows me.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.600
She knows that I'm gonna try
to get both sides of the story,

08:33.600 --> 08:36.559
but I didn't like the way
that it was perceived at all,

08:36.559 --> 08:38.300
and so, I'm sorry.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.562
- See ya, folks.
- Bye. Love y'all.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.085
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:41.085 --> 08:44.480
So, you couldn't make
the party, Heath's party.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.438
Oh, so, did you
come with a boo?

08:46.438 --> 08:48.484
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.268
I didn't come-- no.
I came--

08:50.268 --> 08:51.792
- Are you sure?
- Ah!

08:54.185 --> 08:57.580
No, I came, and I had a--
I had a companion.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.974
All the people you know--
- Mm-hmm.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.280
But it took Monyetta
to hook me up.

09:02.280 --> 09:07.155
Monyetta is best friends with
this super bachelor named Roi,

09:07.155 --> 09:10.027
so she made an introduction,

09:10.027 --> 09:13.596
and I-I am, like,
kinda crazy about him.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.685
He's been very kind to me.
He's funny.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.166
He makes me feel alive,

09:18.166 --> 09:20.037
and he's not bad
on the eyes.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.300
Anybody can hook you up
with somebody,

09:22.300 --> 09:24.825
it would be Monyetta.
- Okay, well, she got it right.

09:24.825 --> 09:28.089
I have been separated
from Marc since 2019,

09:28.089 --> 09:30.657
and this chocolate Barbie doll
looks too damn good

09:30.657 --> 09:32.659
to be single for too long.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.399
So cute too see
them together.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.836
That's awesome.

09:35.836 --> 09:38.142
Everything is just, like,
it just got awakened.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.404
You know what I'm sayin'?
- You're ready. Yeah.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.102
Like, I just felt like
it was just asleep.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.451
- Yeah, okay.
- And now I'm like, okay,

09:42.451 --> 09:43.757
I'm feeling stuff.
I'm feeling stuff.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.585
I'm feeling stuff.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.457
It has just made me feel
like a woman, again.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.677
- That's perfect. Good.
- That's awesome.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.548
So, what else is
going on, Miss Kandi?

09:52.548 --> 09:55.638
Um, well, it's just been
a lot of, you know, work stuff.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.684
I was disappointed
with Sheree and you.

09:57.684 --> 09:58.946
- Okay.
- Talking about Tyrone.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.034
Oh, maybe he's at his
other woman's house.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.296
- On "Speak on It."
- No, no, no.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.864
Because I'm watching
the episode, Sheree.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.430
If you want,
I'm-I'm good clickbait.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.781
See how she posted on her
social media all the times

10:07.781 --> 10:09.652
I had said all those
great things about her?

10:09.652 --> 10:11.262
She just posted this?

10:11.262 --> 10:15.136
Was it around the time I had
posted the-the first spoof?

10:15.136 --> 10:17.486
Talking about me
every week on your show,

10:17.486 --> 10:18.574
and I get it,
because, if you want,

10:18.574 --> 10:19.706
I'm-I'm good clickbait.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.142
You think I needed you
for clickbait?

10:21.142 --> 10:23.666
I was really--
You use me every week, honey.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.842
She wanted to be clickbait.
She's clickbait.

10:25.842 --> 10:28.628
I was definitely
being a petty Betty

10:28.628 --> 10:29.977
when it came
to spoofing Sheree.

10:29.977 --> 10:32.893
Apparently, Sheree never
remembers the things

10:32.893 --> 10:34.982
that she says about
other people.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.549
Girl, I'm gonna
do a you on you.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.638
I'm gonna act like
I don't remember.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.552
What? What you mean?

10:41.684 --> 10:43.033
- It was funny.
- Hilarious.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.426
Yeah, it was funny.
I thought it was funny.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.775
Are you going to the party?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.124
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.692
Uh, you think Sheree is
gonna bring her new boo?

10:49.692 --> 10:51.346
Is she serious?
I hope not.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.436
- I think she's serious.
- You heard about Martell?

10:54.436 --> 10:55.655
Girl, them streets
and you know me.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.743
I try not to pay attention.
- Ooh!

10:56.743 --> 10:57.482
The streets been
talking to you, too?

10:57.482 --> 10:58.614
Yes.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.790
The streets! The streets!

11:00.790 --> 11:02.705
The streets been talking!

11:02.705 --> 11:03.924
The streets say
he's been kicking it

11:03.924 --> 11:05.490
with some chicks
in Atlanta.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.622
Yeah.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.015
- I heard that, too.
- No.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.320
Yes.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.583
Like, you're coming to
down and dipping around?

11:11.583 --> 11:13.368
I mean, it's
a little awkward

11:13.368 --> 11:17.459
because he did lightweight
try to talk to me.

11:17.459 --> 11:17.981
- What?
- Ooh.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.461
Yes.

11:19.461 --> 11:22.333
- No.
- Reaching out via Instagram.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.683
He slid up in your DM?

11:29.166 --> 11:31.038
It's a little awkward

11:31.038 --> 11:34.781
because he did lightweight
try to talk to me.

11:34.781 --> 11:35.607
- Wait, what?
- Ooh.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.566
- Yes.
- Lightweight?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.786
Lightweight like
via Instagram-ish.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.526
Via DM?
Wait, where is that?

11:41.526 --> 11:42.571
Pull up your DMs.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.921
I bet you still there.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.836
Uh, let's see.
- Get it, Kandi.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.447
Kandi got it.
- There he is.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.362
Hit accept.

11:51.362 --> 11:53.974
Wait.

11:53.974 --> 11:57.717
- Oh, my God.
- Hit accept.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.676
Hit accept.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.199
Now what?

12:02.199 --> 12:03.200
Where is the messages?
- He deleted. He deleted.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.549
Oh, he deleted it.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.856
Why didn't I talk
to Martell?

12:06.856 --> 12:08.771
Are you serious?

12:08.771 --> 12:10.381
Every time Martell
looks at a woman,

12:10.381 --> 12:11.513
they come back pregnant.

12:11.513 --> 12:12.732
Luckily, for Sheree,

12:12.732 --> 12:13.950
she doesn't have
any more periods,

12:13.950 --> 12:16.387
so she doesn't have
to worry about that.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.915
He's a thirst trap!

12:24.918 --> 12:27.181
Should I say
something to her?

12:27.181 --> 12:28.878
I mean, you never dated him
or nothin', so it wasn't--

12:28.878 --> 12:30.706
I did not date him.
That's enough about me.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.317
So, I heard Todd
and you fussing

12:33.317 --> 12:36.016
in the background
when you called me yesterday.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.845
Oh, he is trying
to write his movie,

12:38.845 --> 12:41.804
and he feels like

12:41.804 --> 12:44.851
I don't make time
to help him,

12:44.851 --> 12:47.462
but he's always making
time to help me.

12:47.462 --> 12:50.813
Right now, Todd, he actually
has multiple movies

12:50.813 --> 12:54.948
that he has written,
and he wants me to produce.

12:54.948 --> 12:58.125
I'm like I don't really
have time to go produce.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.909
He wanted me
and two other writers

12:59.909 --> 13:02.433
to get together to go
through the script,

13:02.433 --> 13:04.000
at 11:00.
- Mm-hmm.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.786
I said, "I have
an interview at 11:00."

13:06.786 --> 13:08.831
So, the day of, he goes,
"I have to, um,

13:08.831 --> 13:11.312
"do my table read
at 4:00."

13:11.312 --> 13:14.402
I said, "You said
your table read was at 11:00."

13:14.402 --> 13:15.664
11:00.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.318
He said,
"They couldn't do it at 11:00."

13:17.318 --> 13:20.582
I said, "But when I asked
you could we move it,

13:20.582 --> 13:22.105
"you couldn't move it."

13:22.105 --> 13:24.760
He wants to make me a problem.
- Don't cry, Kandi.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.675
- Oh, baby.
- Don't cry, Kandi.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.330
- Because it frustrates me.
- Yeah.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.768
Because sometimes
I feel like--

13:32.768 --> 13:36.511
You do so much.
You have a tissue?

13:36.511 --> 13:40.123
Listen, I understand
that I'm doing a lot,

13:40.123 --> 13:43.823
and I understand that
can be frustrating for him

13:43.823 --> 13:46.869
but don't do things
to make me the problem.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.479
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.220
You know, I'm
trying to do so much,

13:50.220 --> 13:53.397
and I know he wants his dreams
to come true, as well,

13:53.397 --> 13:56.400
but I don't know how
to make it all work.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.403
I don't ever wanna see you
end up in divorce court like me.

13:59.403 --> 14:00.796
Never.

14:00.796 --> 14:03.886
So, my sisterly advice,
you've gotta find a way

14:03.886 --> 14:05.366
to make time
for your husband.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.455
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.986
- So, did you eat?
- No, I'm good.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.727
- Do you wanna eat?
- Not yet.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.990
Okay. How you liking
my bop-bop-bop?

14:20.990 --> 14:22.383
- That's it.
- You're the first one,

14:22.383 --> 14:23.514
and it's exclusive.

14:23.514 --> 14:24.907
I get the first one
off the rack.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.169
- Mommy.
- Yes, baby.

14:26.169 --> 14:29.216
Yeah.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.782
Okay, I will.
I will. I will. I will.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.088
He trying to hustle you
for a popsicle?

14:32.088 --> 14:34.395
Yeah.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.223
He had to get
that one last whisper to mom,

14:36.223 --> 14:37.572
right quick.
- Can he get it or no?

14:37.572 --> 14:38.921
- No.
- You can have some
of this, Deuce.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.053
I want you to try this.
It's super-duper good.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.186
I pinky promise
it's really good.

14:44.753 --> 14:45.972
He shook his head
before he--

14:45.972 --> 14:47.147
No, swallow, baby.
Trust me. Trust me.

14:47.147 --> 14:47.930
- He didn't like the texture.
- Yeah.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.192
My house is more packed

14:49.192 --> 14:51.368
than a New York City
subway station, okay?

14:51.368 --> 14:54.763
There's my mom, and my dad,
me, and my husband.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.070
There's Deuce, my sister,
Shari, her husband, Tyrell,

14:57.070 --> 14:59.246
and Slade, and Shiloh.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.684
We just need a dog now.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.555
Yesterday was disastrous.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.601
The location getting
canceled on us last

15:06.601 --> 15:08.777
minute outta nowhere,
but we got a venue.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.083
Let's go.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
There will be a party,
and there will be lights,

15:12.041 --> 15:14.914
and there will be food,
and there will be people.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.873
Yes, my baby is turning 40,
and he's fine

15:17.873 --> 15:19.657
and just gettin' better
with time.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.659
Man, Ross is such
a great husband.

15:21.659 --> 15:24.227
Whatever it takes to make
him happy, I'll do it.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.229
He loves Black history,
he loves to gamble,

15:26.229 --> 15:29.929
and so, Harlem Nights was
the perfect theme for this bash,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.974
but I still kinda feel
a little bit of pressure

15:31.974 --> 15:34.194
to show the girls
how I really get down.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.979
This isn't how you throw
a party for your friends.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.025
It's giving Party City.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.331
She does not have
white meat chicken,

15:41.331 --> 15:42.419
no bartender,

15:42.419 --> 15:44.030
and a photo booth
that doesn't work.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.336
I know I might've let some
of the Jamaicans down last year,

15:46.336 --> 15:47.990
but that wasn't
really a party.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.514
This party gonna
be a Bashment party.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.081
The thing turn up.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.649
So, the main thing is,
the guest list, the RSVPs.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.477
We gotta finalize that.

15:56.477 --> 15:57.652
I just wanna make sure

15:57.652 --> 15:59.262
all the other contracts
are finalized.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.003
Is being my assistant
harder than you thought,

16:01.003 --> 16:02.048
or easier than
you thought, or--

16:02.048 --> 16:03.963
- Much harder.
- Much harder?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.268
Yeah, yeah.

16:05.268 --> 16:08.097
My brother-in-law has
really had a hard time

16:08.097 --> 16:11.448
getting into the real estate
space here in Atlanta,

16:11.448 --> 16:14.625
and so my hope was hiring him
as my assistant would allow him

16:14.625 --> 16:17.150
to network and meet
all the right people.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.325
You're always
trying somethin',

16:18.325 --> 16:22.068
a podcast, an interview,
or a flight here.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.940
"Put this on my calendar,"
like, somethin'.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.289
Okay, well--

16:26.289 --> 16:28.465
Well, I think that you
don't respect boundaries.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.298
You're trying to find
something else for him to do

16:35.298 --> 16:38.301
instead of allowing him
to just eat his dinner.

16:38.301 --> 16:41.130
It's a really unique dynamic
that I've always had

16:41.130 --> 16:44.307
in my family where I feel
very supported by them,

16:44.307 --> 16:46.309
and I'm also
supporting them.

16:46.309 --> 16:49.008
My mom was my manager.
She was eating off my contract.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.227
My dad also managed me.
My sister did my hair.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.316
Like, they were getting
paid off of my work.

16:53.316 --> 16:56.145
The things that I do bring
opportunities to everyone

16:56.145 --> 16:59.496
in my family, not so much today,
but for many years.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.977
I personally don't think so.
- Here's another example.

17:01.977 --> 17:04.153
We eat dinner at
6:30 every day.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.373
I'll be cooking dinner,
about to plate my dinner,

17:06.373 --> 17:07.765
and Sanya will
say to my kids,

17:07.765 --> 17:09.158
"You guys wanna go outside?"

17:09.158 --> 17:11.552
Now, I got to be
the evil villain that says,

17:11.552 --> 17:14.555
"No, you can't go outside,"
because dingbat decided

17:14.555 --> 17:18.385
to ask a four
and five-year-old at 6:29,

17:18.385 --> 17:20.430
when dinner is at 6:30,
if they wanted to go outside

17:20.430 --> 17:21.997
because she's in a bubble
and not paying attention

17:21.997 --> 17:23.216
to anybody else.

17:23.216 --> 17:24.956
I'm gonna go
check on-on Deuce.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.480
Yeah, me, too.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.872
- I'm gonna go check on Deuce.
- Deuce, you need help?

17:27.872 --> 17:29.004
It's really annoying

17:29.004 --> 17:30.353
because Sanya doesn't
have a schedule,

17:30.353 --> 17:32.312
so I don't know if Sanya
knows what a schedule is.

17:32.312 --> 17:35.141
If she gets home after work
at 11:00 p.m.,

17:35.141 --> 17:38.231
she'll text me,
"Can you cut my wig off?"

17:38.231 --> 17:40.146
And I'm like,
ain't no way.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.538
When Sanya was
running track,

17:41.538 --> 17:44.237
there was a time where
that was the priority.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.978
So, shifting to understand
that that's not the priority

17:46.978 --> 17:48.893
and not even close anymore,

17:48.893 --> 17:51.418
is-is a bit of
a struggle for them.

17:51.418 --> 17:55.465
I need to get him to bed.
- Yeah, definitely.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.208
Aye-aye-aye.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.905
Coming up...

18:00.905 --> 18:02.255
Is it serious,
or is he good?

18:02.255 --> 18:03.256
- What?
- 'Cause I've been--

18:03.256 --> 18:04.257
we've been hearing
some things.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.606
- What you hear, girl?

bitch in the building.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.157
And then when you get home,
the split is so high

18:35.157 --> 18:36.202
you don't even have to

18:45.733 --> 18:47.300

talking to, Todd? What?

18:49.215 --> 18:50.999
We're still doing the script.

Todd, isn't it family time?

18:53.001 --> 18:54.829
When are you about
to stop work?

18:54.829 --> 18:56.483
Babe, I'm trying to
finish this script.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.572
But you're not
gonna finish today.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.965
What page are we on, y'all?

19:00.965 --> 19:03.054
It's family time.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.274
Todd and I are
very driven people,

19:05.274 --> 19:09.191
and, lately,
his movie is taking up

19:09.191 --> 19:11.324
a lot of our family time.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.588
I know I'm busy and
I try to show up for the family

19:14.588 --> 19:16.372
and do everything
that I need to do,

19:16.372 --> 19:18.244
so I'm gonna need him
to show up the same way.

19:18.244 --> 19:20.202
Can I have more
barbecue chips?

19:20.202 --> 19:21.725
No, you're about to
eat your dinner.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.339
Sometimes I feel like
I just can't win with Todd.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.905
So, what was
our last scene?

19:27.905 --> 19:30.343
I do not have the energy

19:30.343 --> 19:33.868
to get all of this done.

19:33.868 --> 19:39.787
I do not have all the energy.

19:39.787 --> 19:40.918
I got my family here.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.921
They-they're telling me
I gotta go.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.533
Here you go.

19:46.533 --> 19:47.360
Yeah, yeah, let's run through
the last one then.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.231
Okay, forget it.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.684
Ahh!
Oh, my God,

20:07.684 --> 20:11.122
I haven't seen a spread
like this for me in a while.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.168
Look, who set this up
for auntie?

20:13.168 --> 20:14.169
- I did.
- I did.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.389
No, I did it.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.391
No matter where we go,
I'm always here

20:18.391 --> 20:19.783
for Taco Tuesdays.

20:19.783 --> 20:23.091
So fancy--
fine China from Target.

20:23.091 --> 20:24.135
Yes.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.267
No. Ha!

20:25.267 --> 20:26.616
What are the different
options here?

20:26.616 --> 20:28.270
Not many.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.271
Oh, Lord.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.272
It's just, um,
steak and shrimp.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.143
Okay, I'll take that.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.668
Even though I haven't heard from
my sister in a few months,

20:34.668 --> 20:36.452
my sister has not
been in contact with the boys

20:36.452 --> 20:37.671
since she got out of jail.

20:37.671 --> 20:40.282
Michael and William,
those are my boys.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.719
They're not going nowhere.
This is forever.

20:42.719 --> 20:45.113
I'm starving, you guys.
I slept all day.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.202
Today drained me.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.638
- Of course.
- Why are you so hungry?

20:48.638 --> 20:50.292
What did you have
for lunch today?

20:50.292 --> 20:52.294
Nasty school lunch food.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.687
That's enough
cheese, please.

20:53.687 --> 20:56.255
You will be constipated, okay?
- Okay.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.518
Coming!

20:58.518 --> 20:59.649
You guys trash that
for Miss Sharon

20:59.649 --> 21:01.434
and let's get
the countertop clean.

21:01.434 --> 21:04.306
Hi, beautiful.
You look so pretty.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.742
How are you?

21:05.742 --> 21:07.091
How are you doing,
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous?

21:07.091 --> 21:08.267
Hey.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.790
Your boys is here
just talking about

21:09.790 --> 21:11.792
how much they miss you.
They're so happy you're here.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.490
Get Miss Sharon's
desk put together.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.971
Recently, the boys and I
have been seeing a life coach.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.451
She has been amazing.

21:18.451 --> 21:21.105
After my hiccups,
I knew I needed Miss Sharon,

21:21.105 --> 21:22.542
and she came to the rescue.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.675
She's showing me
a different way how to live,

21:25.675 --> 21:27.547
how to parent,
somethin' I never knew,

21:27.547 --> 21:29.375
somethin' I never
experienced at home.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.985
She knows how to
calm me down.

21:30.985 --> 21:34.510
As a family, it's a unique
situation wit' you all.

21:34.510 --> 21:37.034
You've been together, what,
for three years, right?

21:37.034 --> 21:40.560
And you didn't know
anything about parenting,

21:40.560 --> 21:42.649
and now
you are mauntie, right?

21:42.649 --> 21:44.912
Then I made one mistake,
and everyone made me feel like

21:44.912 --> 21:46.479
I was an awful person.
- No, it's not a mistake.

21:46.479 --> 21:47.741
No, no, it's not a--
it's not a mistake.

21:47.741 --> 21:50.221
- I kicked the boys out.
- What?

21:50.221 --> 21:52.093
Come on.
I'm going wit' you.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.399
Let's go in the car.
- No.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.138
And then I had to beg someone
to go with me.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.836
I wanted to get away.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.796
Aww.

21:59.796 --> 22:02.277
See, that's the love,
right there.

22:02.277 --> 22:04.497
That was sweet, William.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.368
I just know I love you.
- See, that's the love.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.631
And I would never wanna
just give you away,

22:08.631 --> 22:11.025
and even though I worded it,
and I said that,

22:11.025 --> 22:12.679
I want the best for you.

22:12.679 --> 22:16.509
So, sometimes we say things
in reaction,

22:16.509 --> 22:18.032
and I'm really trying to
make sure that

22:18.032 --> 22:19.468
we're all responsive

22:19.468 --> 22:21.818
when we're communicating
with one another.

22:21.818 --> 22:24.343
So, as you all have been
working with me

22:24.343 --> 22:26.214
over the last couple of months,

22:26.214 --> 22:28.303
I still haven't gotten
a mission statement, but we--

22:28.303 --> 22:29.435
we're gettin' there.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.871
I-I brought up
the mission statement.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.873
The other day, we went out,
and I came up with it.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.396
You did?

22:34.396 --> 22:35.702
I came up with
some suggestions.

22:35.702 --> 22:38.269
I did 'cause--

22:38.269 --> 22:40.576
Okay, what were
your suggestions?

22:40.576 --> 22:44.711
We are a family that
comes together when the times--

22:44.711 --> 22:46.408
when the time is needed.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.715
When time is needed,
family comes together.

22:48.715 --> 22:52.588
And we are a family that
love each other, and, um,

22:52.588 --> 22:53.981
we always have
each other's back.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.504
It was somethin' like that,
though, seriously,

22:55.504 --> 22:57.288
but it needs to sound better.

22:57.288 --> 22:58.812
No, it doesn't.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.249
It-it-it just needs to be
authentically who you all are,

23:01.249 --> 23:02.729
how you wanna show.

23:02.729 --> 23:03.512
And then she said she wanted
to paint a picture and--

23:03.512 --> 23:05.166
Not paint it--
take one.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.734
No, take a picture of you all
showing up in how you want.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.910
The picture will represent
the mission statement.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.999
And so, there are times
in life that, you know,

23:11.999 --> 23:14.871
we get off course,
and you just wanna have

23:14.871 --> 23:17.091
that mission statement
and say, oh, okay,

23:17.091 --> 23:18.179
just like, you know,

23:18.179 --> 23:19.746
you all have
your space, right?

23:19.746 --> 23:23.271
But then you have these memories
and times of thinking about

23:23.271 --> 23:28.537
how things were rough and
then how things were smooth

23:28.537 --> 23:31.322
and how you decided to
make different choices

23:31.322 --> 23:32.672
that were healthy.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.152
This new gentle parenting,
I'm 50-50 with it.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.198
The way I was raised,
my mama said something,

23:37.198 --> 23:39.679
that's what it was,
and, damn, you get upstairs.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.768
It ain't that
it's angry parenting.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.031
It's goddamn it, you know
I'm not playing parenting,

23:44.031 --> 23:47.121
but the gentle parenting
is the listening.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.427
You have to listen.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.298
So, it's just, I feel,
they respect me more,

23:50.298 --> 23:51.778
and I'm respecting them
even more,

23:51.778 --> 23:53.475
and that's important to me.

23:53.475 --> 23:56.173
Right?
Make sense?

23:56.173 --> 23:58.349
Uh-huh.
So, guys, thank you.

23:58.349 --> 23:59.481
Thank you.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.222
This was really
a great session tonight.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.182
Coming up next...

24:05.182 --> 24:07.315
You just bounced up at me!

24:07.315 --> 24:08.490

24:08.490 --> 24:09.578
No. All right.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

24:09.578 --> 24:10.666
- Bitch, don't you--
- Bitch, you--

24:10.666 --> 24:12.015

You're looking--

24:31.339 --> 24:32.688
Good.
No, look at you.

24:32.688 --> 24:36.518
Wait, is that She-- that is--
give me the spin.

24:36.518 --> 24:39.521
Yes!

24:39.521 --> 24:41.784

24:41.784 --> 24:42.959
Thank you.
Let's go down.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.874
All right, come on.
My workout buddy.

24:44.874 --> 24:46.180
Work out.
Work out.

24:46.180 --> 24:47.268
You remember, boo,
this is how we first met.

24:47.268 --> 24:48.704
I know.

24:48.704 --> 24:50.532
Yeah, working out is
the first thing we did together.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.664
So, we're back--
we're back to our roots.

24:51.664 --> 24:52.752
I know.
That's-that's definitely one

24:52.752 --> 24:53.927
of the first things
we bonded on.

24:53.927 --> 24:54.841
We can do a kettle bell swing.
- Okay.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.233
Sheree, your body
looks amazing.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.583
This is gonna give me
the She by Sheree booty?

24:57.583 --> 24:58.671
- Yes.
- Okay, I need it.

24:58.671 --> 24:59.802
That's what I need.
I need my booty.

24:59.802 --> 25:00.716
I need it by Saturday, though.
- Yes.

25:00.716 --> 25:01.978
Yeah, get it up.
Get it up.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.284
Unh, unh, unh.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.415
Can you-- can you
deliver it by Saturday,

25:04.415 --> 25:05.416
so I can give it to Ross
on his birthday?

25:05.416 --> 25:06.287
Oh, I see it.
Yes, yes, yes.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.157
- Yes!
- Hold it out.

25:07.157 --> 25:11.510
Hold it out.
Hold it out.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.294
Yes.

25:13.294 --> 25:15.731
Ooh, yes, girl, yes.
Gettin' ready for that.

25:15.731 --> 25:20.083
Yes, no more TPT, no more.

25:20.083 --> 25:21.607
How are your kids?
- They're good.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.956
- Good.
- Okay, wait.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.697
So, how are the babies?
How is the house?

25:24.697 --> 25:25.959
Like, our family, like,
the other day, girl,

25:25.959 --> 25:28.614
me and my sister,
we had the biggest fight.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.006
Girl, it just,
like, she was like,

25:30.006 --> 25:31.660
"Y'all don't have
no boundaries," 'cause--

25:31.660 --> 25:33.749
so, my brother-in-law actually
works for me now.

25:33.749 --> 25:35.577
Like, he's my assistant,
so he is, like--

25:35.577 --> 25:37.927
Oh, oh,
how is that working?

25:37.927 --> 25:39.494
It's-it's-it's
good and bad.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.540
It can feel like I'm asking him
to do a lot of stuff

25:41.540 --> 25:43.106
because I'm asking him
to work and then--

25:44.064 --> 25:44.586
You know what?
There is a door.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.848
Hold on.

25:45.848 --> 25:46.719
Hold on to that thought
because this was--

25:46.719 --> 25:47.981
Okay, let me keep working.

25:47.981 --> 25:50.157
I gotta get this butt
by Saturday, chile.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.985
Oh.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.816
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

25:56.816 --> 25:58.600
- Hi, beautiful.
- How are you?

25:58.600 --> 25:59.862
- How are you?
- Good.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.342
You look beautiful.

26:01.342 --> 26:03.605
You're looking-- you look--
let me borrow that body.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.998
Courtney is
a girlfriend of mine.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.782
Our kids went to
school together.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.568
Her daughter is right
between Kairo and Kaleigh.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.047
Courtney is a Capricorn.

26:11.047 --> 26:13.572
She is no nonsense.
She's not a fake person.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.575
She's just an all-around
girls' girl.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.968
Come on in. Hi.
Wonderful to meet you.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.404
- Good to finally meet you.
- Sanya, that's Courtney.

26:20.404 --> 26:23.886
I can do squats in these boots
if y'all want me to.

26:23.886 --> 26:26.497
- Uh-huh.
- That's not a squat.

26:26.497 --> 26:29.326
That's dropping it, girl.

26:29.326 --> 26:31.981
The fact that she came
in these thigh high boots

26:31.981 --> 26:34.680
and is still dropping it
like it's hot, yes, Courtney.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.942
You're my kinda girl.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.508
I got some little treats
'cause I know--

26:37.508 --> 26:38.901
- Okay.
- I knew you'd, uh,

26:38.901 --> 26:39.772
need some protein after this
and a little snack.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.382
Yes.
Ooh, smoothies.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.166
Yay.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.341
So-- and so,
what do you do?

26:44.341 --> 26:47.388
I have a marketing
consulting company

26:47.388 --> 26:48.824
and also a jewelry brand.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.913
I'm wearing my jewelry.
- Oh, nice.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.045
Oh, I love that.
- Beautiful, oh, yeah.

26:52.045 --> 26:53.046
Do you ladies
want me to pour you?

26:53.046 --> 26:55.788
Yes, that would be great.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.180
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.268
You're welcome.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.792
Oh, and I told her
I invited you

26:59.792 --> 27:00.357
to her husband's-- that's her
husband's birthday party.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.620
Oh, yeah, right.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.969
I still have to find
somethin' to wear.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.927
It's a Har-Harlem--
- It's Harlem Nights theme

27:04.927 --> 27:06.712
but not--
don't buy no costume.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.539
- A short, um-- yeah.
- Yes,

27:08.539 --> 27:09.976
a little thing in your hair,

27:09.976 --> 27:11.107
something like that, yes.
- Yes, feathers.

27:11.107 --> 27:12.587
You know, I invited
all the girls.

27:12.587 --> 27:13.588
So, that doesn't always--
- Uh-oh.

27:13.588 --> 27:15.416
Yeah, okay.
So, Courtney--

27:15.416 --> 27:17.157
Courtney, who do you know?
Do you know any of the girls?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.767
I hung out
with Marlo briefly.

27:18.767 --> 27:19.812
- Okay.
- Uh, yeah.

27:19.812 --> 27:21.161
Marlo is gonna
be there for sure.

27:21.161 --> 27:22.815
- Okay, nice.
- Um, and then, yeah, like...

27:24.033 --> 27:25.469
Oh.

27:25.469 --> 27:26.601
- Say what you mean and be--
- Drew, stop faking, bro.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.821
You need to stop
being phony, bro!

27:28.821 --> 27:30.170
So, I actually
sent the invite,

27:30.170 --> 27:31.780
and Ralph actually was
the one that RSVPed

27:31.780 --> 27:33.173
for both of them.
- Oh, good.

27:33.173 --> 27:34.870
Kandi is coming.
Kandi was the first one to RSVP.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.959
Um, Kandi seems cool.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.700
We've been in
similar, um, circles.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.659
Yeah, circles.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.703
I don't know
if I told you this,

27:41.703 --> 27:42.835
but I thought this
was interesting.

27:42.835 --> 27:44.053
Did I tell you she
was calling around

27:44.053 --> 27:45.664
asking some people
about me?

27:45.664 --> 27:48.536
And she was like, "I heard
she said that we were friends."

27:48.536 --> 27:50.059
Um...

27:50.059 --> 27:51.104
What? Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

27:51.104 --> 27:52.322
Why would I say
we're friends?

27:52.322 --> 27:53.584
So, she's going around
telling people--

27:53.584 --> 27:55.108
And pulled up my Instagram.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.718
She's like, "What do you
know about her?"

27:56.718 --> 27:58.807
Which I think is interesting
'cause I think you are global,

27:58.807 --> 27:59.895
and you are worldwide,

27:59.895 --> 28:01.810
so why are you
concerned about me?

28:01.810 --> 28:04.073
Like, why do you
even care, right?

28:04.073 --> 28:05.422
Right.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.728
Kandi has a lot of time
on her hands, lately.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.903
She has time to do that,
but she also has time

28:07.903 --> 28:10.166
to make memes or whatever
about me, as well.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.603
I'm kind of feeling a certain
type of way about Kandi.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.171
I thought we were good,
but she still continued

28:15.171 --> 28:17.260
to talk about me
with her spoofs.

28:17.260 --> 28:19.219
Talking about me
every week on your show,

28:19.219 --> 28:20.611
and I get it
'cause, if you want,

28:20.611 --> 28:22.091
I'm-I'm good clickbait.

28:22.091 --> 28:24.746
The only time Kandi is
not talking about people or me

28:24.746 --> 28:26.966
is when she's eating
or sucking dick

28:26.966 --> 28:28.445
but not in a locker room.

28:28.445 --> 28:29.620
But she's global.
- Shut up.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.752
That doesn't seem
like her, though.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.928
Listen, me and Kandi
are great.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.756
We actually got a reels
we're dropping today.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.193
Let's not make it
about Sheree.

28:37.193 --> 28:39.108
I don't-- I don't do
skits or spoofs, okay?

28:39.108 --> 28:40.675
I'm not in those.
- No, no. Okay.

28:40.675 --> 28:42.111
And does that glow
that you have,

28:42.111 --> 28:43.634
have anything to do
with Martell?

28:43.634 --> 28:45.027
Mm-hmm.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.072
That may have a little bit
to do with Martell.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.377
- Aww.
- 'Cause you look amazing.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.031
Your spirit is like--
- Yeah, you look good.

28:49.031 --> 28:49.640
He's a good guy, and I really
have a good time around him.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.903
- Good.
- Yeah.

28:50.903 --> 28:51.991
- You deserve that.
- So, we're enjoying--

28:51.991 --> 28:53.166
we're enjoying each other.
- Mm-hmm.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.950
We have not put a label
on anything.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.125
Because the thing is,
I don't want you,

28:56.125 --> 28:57.648
like, to waste time.
- I know.

28:57.648 --> 28:58.954
- Not saying that you've gotta--
- We have to-- we-we both

28:58.954 --> 29:00.651
went into it saying
we wanna be intentional.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.088
Yeah, you gotta
be intentional.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.263
- Yeah.
- This is your season.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.568
I keep telling you
this is your season.

29:04.568 --> 29:05.961
- Your season, yeah.
- Own it.

29:05.961 --> 29:06.962
- Mm-hmm.
- You keep saying that.

29:06.962 --> 29:08.964
I believe it.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.792
Coming up next...

29:10.792 --> 29:12.054
Where is your wife?

29:13.839 --> 29:15.231
You've gotta
be there, Ralph.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.146
That's part of
your family, too.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.021
♪ I run this

29:22.021 --> 29:24.414
♪ yeah you know
I run this ♪

29:26.677 --> 29:28.244

29:29.289 --> 29:30.899

I know.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.684
Wow.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.643
♪ You know I run this

29:35.643 --> 29:38.994
Yolande!

29:38.994 --> 29:40.430
- We're almost there.
- Yes.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.563
Wait. Yo, did you do
these lights?

29:42.563 --> 29:44.043
- Yeah.
- What?

29:44.043 --> 29:45.871
Girl, when you spend as
much coin as you spent,

29:45.871 --> 29:48.482
so this--
- What? What? What?

29:48.482 --> 29:51.746
Originally, I had set
a $40,000 budget

29:51.746 --> 29:53.095
for Ross's 40th birthday.

29:53.095 --> 29:55.054
I thought that would suffice.

29:55.054 --> 29:58.753
After casino tables,
dancers, DJ, all the things,

29:58.753 --> 30:01.582
I'm sitting at
about 100 grand.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.020
Whatever it takes.

30:05.020 --> 30:07.806
Yes, yes, the games!
Yes, the games.

30:12.767 --> 30:15.814
Definitely not that.
That's giving me '70s prom.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.425
So, should I just do this,
or should I try somethin' else?

30:18.425 --> 30:20.862
That look like
'20s, '30s, '40s, yeah.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.298
So, no pimp hat.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.866
Not unless you want Marlo
coming to you for a job.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.433
You're stupid.

30:29.262 --> 30:31.003
I'm gonna do, like, a bob.
I want a bob.

30:31.003 --> 30:32.439
Oh, so, a bob, okay.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.223
You know, I love
the big hair, girl.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.051
Yes, it's gonna be
so crazy 'cause, you know,

30:36.051 --> 30:38.793
I haven't seen Kandi
since New York.

30:38.793 --> 30:41.317
So, this will be my first time
seeing her tonight,

30:41.317 --> 30:42.666
but I--
- Oh, but did you--

30:42.666 --> 30:45.278
but did you see
the-the-the spoofs on Instagram?

30:45.278 --> 30:47.497
I had this new miracle surgery
on my edges,

30:47.497 --> 30:49.151
and it's doing wonders.
Do you love it?

30:49.151 --> 30:51.110
Girl, you look good.

30:52.676 --> 30:53.939
Look, stick to that, baby,

30:53.939 --> 30:55.505
'cause Broadway ain't
working out for you.

30:55.505 --> 30:57.116
And singing ain't
working out for you.

30:57.116 --> 30:58.639
Stick to them spoofs.
- Oh, no, no, no.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.119
The sh-- was funny
as hell.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.643
Like, oh, my God,
but I'm cool on Kandi.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.645
Kandi can meet me
right where she had

31:04.645 --> 31:06.255
my hairline there,
right-- where is that?

31:06.255 --> 31:08.562
Right there above
the eyebrows?

31:08.562 --> 31:10.390
We're good, right there.

31:10.390 --> 31:13.436
Yeah, be like, girl,
you wanna fix your part.

31:13.436 --> 31:14.524
Oh!

31:37.417 --> 31:38.679
This is
the Black Met Gala.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.637
It feels like my wedding day.
I'm not lying.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.600
It starts when
you get here, child.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.688
No, ma'am, 'cause
you're not dressed.

31:47.688 --> 31:48.732
You look good.

31:48.732 --> 31:50.299
Shari and Tyrell
are off tonight.

31:50.299 --> 31:52.301
They're not working.
They are just guests.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.607
I mean, I don't mind
if she just comes

31:53.607 --> 31:55.043
and touches up my edges.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.131
No, I'm just joking.
I'm gonna give her off.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.393
She's off.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.268
- Yes, and we're--
- You're giving.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.834
and we're not prepared for
what you're giving, honey.

32:08.274 --> 32:10.972
My expectations are
a little low tonight.

32:10.972 --> 32:14.019
I'm setting the bar
pretty low

32:14.019 --> 32:17.152
because if Sanya keeps up
with the shenanigans

32:17.152 --> 32:18.893
of the dry beef patties--

32:18.893 --> 32:20.199
Did you cook this?

32:20.199 --> 32:22.375
And the cheap
Party City décor,

32:22.375 --> 32:25.073
I may not respond with
a yes to her next party.

32:27.771 --> 32:29.991
Yes, cute.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.775
Hi.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.911
Mr. Tequila, hi.
- Hey, hey, what's going on?

32:36.911 --> 32:38.913
Muah, muah.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.567
- How you doin'?
- Yes, this is my friend, Akilah.

32:40.567 --> 32:42.221
This is Ralph.
- Akilah, nice to meet you.

32:42.221 --> 32:43.700
This is Drew's husband.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.050
Yes, yes, yes.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.138
Where is your wife?

32:46.138 --> 32:47.617
Of course, she's
not feeling well.

32:47.617 --> 32:48.923
You know, we got a family--
- Are you serious?

32:48.923 --> 32:50.185
Yeah.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.839
Yeah, we got
a family emergency.

32:51.839 --> 32:53.188
Oh, wow.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.321
She got a family crisis
going on.

32:55.321 --> 32:58.628
Ralph is saying there
was a crisis in the family.

32:58.628 --> 33:01.414
He forgot he was married
to the crisis.

33:01.414 --> 33:03.851
Like, you've gotta
be there, Ralph.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.679
That's part of
your family, too.

33:05.679 --> 33:07.376
She has a lot
going on with family.

33:07.376 --> 33:09.813
Her father is sick,
so she's dealing with a lot.

33:09.813 --> 33:11.685
I need to make sure
I show love and support

33:11.685 --> 33:12.773
to my boy, though.

33:12.773 --> 33:15.036
It's his 40th.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.472
Where is Ross?

33:19.606 --> 33:21.216
Hello.

33:24.654 --> 33:27.309
- Hi.
- Hello.

33:27.309 --> 33:29.659
Muah, muah.
You look beautiful.

33:29.659 --> 33:30.791
Thanks.

33:30.791 --> 33:33.272
She put a lot of money
into this one.

33:33.272 --> 33:35.535
You're still not on
the Kandi Burruss party level,

33:35.535 --> 33:37.972
but you're doing good.
You're doing good.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.234
Where is Drew?

33:39.234 --> 33:40.888
She's got a family crisis
going on.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.333
Where is
the birthday boy?

33:52.595 --> 33:55.642
Hi, ladies.
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

33:57.122 --> 33:58.993
You're taking all my money.
This thing [indistinct].

33:58.993 --> 34:00.081
Uh uh, I got it.
I got it.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.691
Oh, okay,
keep yours, though.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.476
Since I'm not
looking forward to seeing

34:03.476 --> 34:05.347
some of these ladies tonight,

34:05.347 --> 34:07.088
I'm gonna stay quiet

34:07.088 --> 34:09.656
and try and win
some money over here.

34:09.656 --> 34:12.224
- You side betting?
- I don't know what I'm doing.

34:12.224 --> 34:14.008
The vibe here is good,

34:14.008 --> 34:16.184
but, baby, hopefully,
they don't drink too much.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.664
We might have
up in here

34:17.664 --> 34:19.622
and shoot somebody
in the pinky toe.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.368
There is our girl
of the hour.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.633
That's not our girl
of the hour, honey.

34:30.633 --> 34:32.896
How are you?
You look beautiful.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.031
- Shut up.
- Yeah,

34:37.031 --> 34:38.554
we just found out this,
right now,

34:38.554 --> 34:40.121
like, literally.
- No, literally.

34:40.121 --> 34:45.996
♪ This is the house party

34:45.996 --> 34:49.435

Welcome to Ross's
40th bash,

35:01.273 --> 35:04.058
Harlem Nights Atlanta style.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.539
Yes.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.454
You're so easy to love.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.891
You are my everything.
You are my king.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.849
Happy birthday, baby.

35:15.678 --> 35:17.898
Appreciate everybody
coming out.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.160
Y'all are looking good.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.554
Let's party, baby!

35:27.255 --> 35:28.952
Good to see you,
baby, yeah.

35:33.653 --> 35:35.481
Hey.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.917
What's up, girl?

35:36.917 --> 35:38.136
- How are you?
- I'm good.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.572
Look at you, diva.
- I love it.

35:39.572 --> 35:41.008
Thank you.

35:41.008 --> 35:43.489
Hey, Kenya, you look amazing.
- Hey, skinny mini.

35:43.489 --> 35:44.925
Congratulations.
- How are you?

35:44.925 --> 35:45.752
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

35:53.890 --> 35:58.025
Oh, girl, you look good.
You look so good.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.375
You look amazing.
- I know.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.116
Hey, you made it.

36:02.116 --> 36:03.335
Thank you so much.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.554
I'm jealous.
I'm jealous!

36:05.554 --> 36:09.776
Why is he here
on your arm?

36:09.776 --> 36:14.259
Last year, Sheree was with
Mr. Community Service, okay?

36:14.259 --> 36:16.696
This year, she's with
community property.

36:16.696 --> 36:17.610
He ain't got no
ankle bracelet on,

36:17.610 --> 36:19.916
so I think
it's an upgrade.

36:19.916 --> 36:20.961
It's such a great thing

36:20.961 --> 36:22.310
that you had
this 40th birthday.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.398
I'm happy to be here.
- Thank you. Thank you.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.621
Hello, Sheree.
How you doin'?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.971
What's up, Kandi?
That's cute.

36:30.971 --> 36:33.495
How are you?
- Good.

36:33.495 --> 36:34.888
I don't have much to
say to Kandi tonight,

36:34.888 --> 36:37.630
but as long as she
and the Kandi Coated clique

36:37.630 --> 36:40.285
keeps it cute,
then we should be good.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.504
- Is this official, though?
- I know!

36:42.504 --> 36:44.114
We're officially dating
and all that good stuff.

36:44.114 --> 36:45.812
Okay.

36:45.812 --> 36:48.162
Why are you looking at me
like that?

36:48.162 --> 36:49.250
Really.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.512
Kenya is
so damn nosy.

36:50.512 --> 36:52.035
Stop worrying
about my relationship

36:52.035 --> 36:54.473
and worry about if Marc
is going to take Moore Manor

36:54.473 --> 36:55.822
in the divorce settlement,

36:55.822 --> 36:57.650
and hopefully
he adds baseboards.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.479
I think Sheree needs
her own spin-off show.

37:00.479 --> 37:03.090
"Watch Me Date
These Dumb Dudes."

37:05.266 --> 37:07.050
The infamous
Courtney, baby,

37:07.050 --> 37:09.009
we have to talk, darling.

37:09.009 --> 37:10.619
- So--
- So, wait a minute.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.708
So, well, Sanya told me she's
going around telling people

37:12.708 --> 37:14.319
that you're her
friend or something.

37:14.319 --> 37:15.929
You know a girl
named Courtney?

37:15.929 --> 37:19.324
One of her friends called her
and told her that Kandi went

37:19.324 --> 37:20.803
and looked her up
and was like,

37:20.803 --> 37:22.196
"Courtney is going around
telling people

37:22.196 --> 37:24.459
she's my friend."
- Oh, girl!

37:24.459 --> 37:25.939
My business partner
calls me in Paris,

37:25.939 --> 37:30.813
and she's like,
"Um, did you tell somebody

37:30.813 --> 37:32.337
that you and Kandi
were friends,

37:32.337 --> 37:33.207
because they just--
- What?

37:33.207 --> 37:34.469
Asked me about it?"

37:34.469 --> 37:35.818
Do I look like I'm
desperate for friends?

37:35.818 --> 37:39.257
I'm so excited this drama
does not involve me,

37:39.257 --> 37:41.476
but, baby,
if there is tea,

37:41.476 --> 37:44.653
you know
I'm gonna sip it.

37:44.653 --> 37:47.526
The person that said it,
she has no reason to lie.

37:47.526 --> 37:48.831
- Wow.
- She's actually her friend.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.224
You're gonna have to
say somethin' to her

37:50.224 --> 37:51.530
about that, though.
- Yeah.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.450
- Doing good, my love?
- Good.

37:58.450 --> 37:59.755
It's nice to see you.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.018
- What's up, baby?
- What's happening, homey?

38:02.018 --> 38:02.976
- How you doing, boy?
- You're good?

38:05.326 --> 38:07.981
- That's so disrespectful.
- Listen, listen, listen.

38:07.981 --> 38:11.941
I know of another person
in Atlanta

38:11.941 --> 38:14.248
that he has actually
been kicking it with.

38:14.248 --> 38:17.556
If this is just about the D,
let it be about the D.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.775
But what if ain't
just about the D?

38:19.775 --> 38:22.865
- Do we say something?
- Maybe he told her already.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.259
That's very possible.
That's very possible.

38:25.259 --> 38:26.565
So, we gotta--
we gotta find out.

38:26.565 --> 38:28.436
Kenya, this is
my girlfriend, Courtney.

38:28.436 --> 38:29.785
- Hi, Kenya.
- Hi.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.047
How do you know
Sheree?

38:31.047 --> 38:32.832
Our kids went
to school together.

38:32.832 --> 38:35.138
Oh, yeah, she has
amazing children.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.793
I do wanna talk to you
for a second, though.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.014
- Okay.
- All right.

38:41.014 --> 38:42.798
Let's go have a drink.
- Let's go have a drink.

38:42.798 --> 38:44.147
- Yeah.
- Y'all be having a side--

38:44.147 --> 38:45.410
a side conversation?

38:45.410 --> 38:47.368
- Marlo, you're doing somethin'.
- Oh, I won!

38:47.368 --> 38:48.456
- Hey, how are you?
- How you doin'?

38:48.456 --> 38:49.588
Great.
How are you doing?

38:49.588 --> 38:51.329
- Good, good.
- Have you met Courtney?

38:51.329 --> 38:52.373
We've seen each other,
I guess, before.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.853
- Yeah, we have.
- Oh, yeah.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.637
- How are you feeling?
- I mean, it turned out great.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.422
All your stress
has worked out.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.162
This is a nice party.

38:59.162 --> 39:01.600
She definitely redeemed
herself from the other party.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.602
Oh, my God.

39:03.602 --> 39:04.733
No, it's really nice.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.996
Like, it-it's top notch.

39:06.996 --> 39:08.215
I need a drink.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.042
You want a drink?

39:09.042 --> 39:10.478
- Yes.
- Okay.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.480
Dina called me when I was
in Paris and was like,

39:12.480 --> 39:14.439
"Hey, did you
tell somebody

39:14.439 --> 39:16.745
that you and Kandi
were friends?"

39:16.745 --> 39:18.486
I was like, "What?"

39:18.486 --> 39:20.009
Somebody asked me,
did I know you,

39:20.009 --> 39:21.663
and I was like,
"I don't know her,"

39:21.663 --> 39:23.230
but I was like--
- Yeah, but I never said

39:23.230 --> 39:24.536
that we were friends,

39:24.536 --> 39:25.798
and I was like I don't
have to make up friends.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.843
I know a girl
named Dina Marto

39:27.843 --> 39:29.410
'cause she's in
the music industry.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.412
You know, I heard
that her and Courtney

39:31.412 --> 39:33.414
are doing some
business together.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.763
I don't know Courtney.

39:34.763 --> 39:37.070
I don't know nobody else
who knows Courtney,

39:37.070 --> 39:40.769
and this is not any shade.
It's just facts.

39:40.769 --> 39:42.510
I don't even really
know you like that.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.816
I didn't say
that I knew you.

39:43.816 --> 39:46.035
I said we were in the similar
social settings.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.602
Okay, well,
what's the energy?

39:47.602 --> 39:48.603
The energy is just like,
you know,

39:48.603 --> 39:49.778
'cause I was
kinda shocked.

39:49.778 --> 39:51.389
If we met each
other before,

39:51.389 --> 39:53.521
that doesn't even mean, like,
if somebody said your name,

39:53.521 --> 39:55.088
I wouldn't really
remember you like that.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.220
And that's okay.
I didn't say that.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.222
Okay, well, you don't have
to give me the crazy energy.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.528
The-- it's not crazy.

40:00.528 --> 40:01.921
So...

40:07.666 --> 40:09.015
That's why I'm just
living life, right now,

40:09.015 --> 40:10.320
and enjoying--
- Okay, so, and that's--

40:10.320 --> 40:11.278
- And having a good time.
- What I wanna know.

40:11.278 --> 40:12.410
Is it serious?
Are you good?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.759
- Why?
- 'Cause I've been--

40:13.759 --> 40:15.238
Been hearing some things.
- What you hear, girl?

40:15.238 --> 40:17.763
Girl,
me and Kandi heard

40:17.763 --> 40:20.287
that he was also dating
someone in Atlanta.

40:23.333 --> 40:25.074
She--
I ain't seen her.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.380
Okay, he's been here
for the last three days.

40:26.380 --> 40:27.729
Where's she at?
- Oh!

40:27.729 --> 40:29.731
Now, Monyetta
wanna have a voice.

40:29.731 --> 40:32.125
She ain't say
five words

40:32.125 --> 40:33.648
when we were
all together last time.

40:33.648 --> 40:35.563
Girl, honey,
this is Ferrari.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.565
This is a Ferrari, honey.

40:37.565 --> 40:38.827
If he's cheating
with another girl,

40:38.827 --> 40:40.089
that's like a Toyota.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.787
Now, if you wanna downgrade,
that's on him.

40:41.787 --> 40:43.702
You know what I'm saying?
So, that was it 'cause--

40:43.702 --> 40:46.226
- I appreciate it.
- No, for real.

40:46.226 --> 40:48.837
I was told that you said that
I claimed you as a friend.

40:48.837 --> 40:50.926
I asked them
if they knew you.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.580
Okay, well, that wasn't
how it came back to me.

40:52.580 --> 40:56.932
And when I saw the picture
of you with Dina, I knew her.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.934
I didn't know you.
The truth is,

40:58.934 --> 41:00.066
I don't know you.
- But, wait, Kandi.

41:00.066 --> 41:01.284
The truth is,
I don't know you,

41:01.284 --> 41:02.285
and I never claimed--
- Okay, so, what--

41:02.285 --> 41:03.548
- To know you.
- I'm saying is--

41:03.548 --> 41:04.549
And what I'm saying is,
I never said that.

41:04.549 --> 41:05.767
- No, no, no, no.
- You backtrack.

41:05.767 --> 41:06.986
- Wait, wait, wait--
- No, I'm-I'm good.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.204
- Wait, wait, wait.
- No, you backtrack.

41:08.204 --> 41:09.467
- But listen, wait--
- I never said that.

41:09.467 --> 41:10.729
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm hoping that y'all

41:10.729 --> 41:12.078
have cleared the air.
This is how I feel.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.688
I feel like you are feeling
a certain kind of way,

41:13.688 --> 41:15.560
which you told me,
and I think you did bring

41:15.560 --> 41:16.561
that energy
to the conversation.

41:16.561 --> 41:17.605
So...
- I apologize.

41:17.605 --> 41:19.128
I just wanted clarity.

41:19.128 --> 41:21.130
Thank you for checking me.
- That's cool. That's cool.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.871
And I'm grown enough
to be accountable.

41:22.871 --> 41:23.916
Yeah, that's cool.

41:23.916 --> 41:24.830
My feelings were
definitely hurt.

41:26.571 --> 41:27.528
Sure.

41:27.528 --> 41:28.616
And I was a bit disappointed.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.139
I don't have to
clout chase.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.578
- There you go, again.
- Because you're--

41:33.578 --> 41:34.927
'Cause you keep
bouncing your head

41:34.927 --> 41:36.015
with this whole you don't
have to clout chase--

41:36.015 --> 41:37.495
Because I'm--
I'm bouncing for--

41:37.495 --> 41:39.235
As if I said
you're clout chasing.

41:39.235 --> 41:41.368
I never said
you clout chased.
- Okay.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.805
Is this what Kandi looks like
when she's mad at me?

41:43.805 --> 41:45.328
Baby, I got
front row seats

41:45.328 --> 41:46.765
to Kandi
in the boxing ring,

41:46.765 --> 41:49.245
and I did not
cause the mess.

41:49.245 --> 41:50.246
The energy you just--

41:50.246 --> 41:52.379
But you just
bounced up at me!

41:52.379 --> 41:53.336
Well, let's
bring it down.

41:53.336 --> 41:54.773
Well, stop
bouncing at me!

41:54.773 --> 41:55.861
Well, calm
the down.

41:55.861 --> 41:57.253
No, all right.
No, no, no, no, no.

41:57.253 --> 41:58.907
- Bitch, don't you--
- Bitch? Bitch, you better--

41:58.907 --> 42:00.648
I'm about to
headbutt this bitch!

42:00.648 --> 42:02.955
- Okay.
- No, no, no. No, no. No, no.

42:02.955 --> 42:04.043
There is
somethin' else.

42:06.219 --> 42:10.005
You should know that he did
slide into my DMs before.

42:10.005 --> 42:11.877
- Let me see it.
- Wait!

42:11.877 --> 42:14.444
As a friend, I'd just want
somebody to be honest with me.

42:14.444 --> 42:16.577
Yeah.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.013
I just wanna--
'cause I don't want you

42:18.013 --> 42:19.101
hearing it
from anybody else.

42:19.101 --> 42:21.103
Well, you know what?
He's here.

42:21.103 --> 42:22.583
Why don't I call him
over here,

42:22.583 --> 42:25.194
and you tell him what
you just told me?

42:25.194 --> 42:27.501
You know what?
I'd want you to tell me.

42:27.501 --> 42:30.156
There he is.

42:30.156 --> 42:33.551
Ooh, I'm not trying to be
rolling on the ground

42:33.551 --> 42:35.117
with She-Man over here.

42:35.117 --> 42:37.467
I look too damn
good in this dress.

42:37.467 --> 42:39.992
Oh, my God!

42:42.603 --> 42:44.605
I'm sorry.
Did you just curse at me?

42:44.605 --> 42:45.737
- I said if I--
- What did you say

42:45.737 --> 42:47.956
to this queen standing
in front of you?

42:47.956 --> 42:49.436
Y'all are trying to
create a narrative,

42:49.436 --> 42:50.655
which is
really----ed up,

42:50.655 --> 42:52.091
'cause it happened
two years ago.
