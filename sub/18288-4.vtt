09:39.847 --> 09:41.815
INSERT YOUR THUMB,

09:41.849 --> 09:44.752
OR THUMBS, OR FINGER,
WHICHEVER YOU PREFER,

09:44.785 --> 09:45.986
AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN

09:46.019 --> 09:48.321
INSIDE HER VAGINA,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.791
AND WHILE
YOU MASSAGE,

09:50.824 --> 09:52.225
HOOK YOUR THUMBS

09:52.259 --> 09:54.928
ONTO THE SIDES
OF THE VAGINAL CANAL,

09:54.962 --> 10:00.333
AND GENTLY PULL THE TISSUES
DOWN AND FORWARD.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.735
JUST LIKE THIS.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.006
SOME OF YOU MIGHT ALREADY KNOW

10:06.039 --> 10:08.942
HOW MUCH PLEASURE
THIS CAN GIVE HER.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.712
[TITTERS FROM GROUP]

10:11.745 --> 10:13.046
DEKE COLLECTED,

10:13.080 --> 10:15.182
BUT IT WAS JUST
AS AN INVESTMENT.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.850
WELL, I HEARD YOU AND DEKE
HAD QUITE A COLLECTION.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.286
IT'S MY COLLECTION NOW.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.655
[LAUGHING]

10:21.689 --> 10:24.124
DO YOU KNOW THIS ARTIST,
LIZ CRAFT?

10:24.157 --> 10:25.325
SURE.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.094
I PUT HER IN A SHOW
WHEN I WAS AT CAC.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.796
"PROVOCATIONS."

10:28.829 --> 10:30.063
IT WAS HER FIRST MUSEUM SHOW.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.100
IT'S AMAZING TO ME

10:33.133 --> 10:35.068
THAT YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD
THIS PASSION,

10:35.102 --> 10:38.005
AND YOU'VE JUST
STAYED TRUE TO IT.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.907
IT'S SOMETHING I-I'VE ALWAYS
DREAMED OF BEING A PART OF.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.375
GOD, HAVING A SHITLOAD OF MONEY
CERTAINLY HELPS.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.079
SO WHY AN ART GALLERY?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.247
WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW I'VE ALWAYS LOVED

10:47.280 --> 10:48.782
CONTEMPORARY ART.

10:48.816 --> 10:49.649
I MEAN, GOING BACK TO YALE,

10:49.683 --> 10:52.686
WHEN YOU T.A.'D
FOR SCULLY'S CLASS?

10:52.720 --> 10:55.188
YOU GAVE ME THAT, BETTE,
YOU DID.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.724
IT WAS A GIFT.

10:56.757 --> 10:57.991
WELL, THAT'S NICE OF YOU
TO SAY.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.460
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:00.493 --> 11:01.829
I'M NOT GOING TO
LIE TO YOU, TINA.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.063
OH, IT'S TOO LATE,
YOU ALREADY DID.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.065
IF MY AGENT HAD GIVEN YOU
MY REAL NAME,

11:05.098 --> 11:07.334
YOU NEVER
WOULD HAVE SEEN ME.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.369
I'M NOT HERE
LOOKING FOR A JOB.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.038
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING,

11:11.071 --> 11:13.173
BECAUSE THE LAST PROJECT
REALLY DIDN'T END SO WELL.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.913
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.915
YOU BELIEVED IN ME
AS A DIRECTOR,

11:21.949 --> 11:23.450
YOU GAVE ME A CHANCE,

11:23.483 --> 11:26.086
AND I COMPLETELY
BETRAYED YOUR TRUST.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.888
I'M SO SORRY
FOR THAT,

11:27.921 --> 11:30.490
BUT...

11:30.523 --> 11:34.027
I'M HERE BECAUSE
I'VE GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.462
HELENA IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

11:35.495 --> 11:38.832
AND I WOULD
GIVE ANYTHING

11:38.866 --> 11:42.135
FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
TO BE WITH HER.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.706
AND YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.784
NO, I CAN'T.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.154
I'M SORRY, DYLAN,
I CAN'T.

12:03.891 --> 12:04.958
CAN YOU INTRODUCE ME
TO ARTISTS

12:04.992 --> 12:06.226
THAT YOU THINK
ARE EXCITING?

12:06.259 --> 12:08.929
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT PEOPLE
TO PAY ATTENTION

12:08.962 --> 12:10.130
TO WHAT I'M CREATING HERE.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.365
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU HAVE TROUBLE

12:12.399 --> 12:14.334
GETTING PEOPLE TO
PAY ATTENTION TO YOU, KELLY.

12:14.367 --> 12:18.005
THEN POINT ME TO
WHO I SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.140
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU KNOW.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.442
IT'S TAKEN ME 20 YEARS
TO KNOW WHAT I KNOW.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.543
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN AT THIS

12:23.576 --> 12:25.012
WHAT, NINE MONTHS?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.046
WELL, THAT'S WHY
I NEED YOUR HELP.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.984
IT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.423
BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.891
IF YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT THIS THING...

12:37.925 --> 12:39.359
MM-HMM.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.195
I MEAN, IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO BE A PLAYER,

12:42.229 --> 12:44.531
AND YOU REALLY WANT TO BE
TAKEN SERIOUSLY

12:44.564 --> 12:45.933
IN THE ART WORLD,
I MEAN,

12:45.966 --> 12:47.334
THE BEST WAY
I CAN THINK OF

12:47.367 --> 12:50.503
TO HELP YOU TO MAKE
YOUR GALLERY A CONTENDER

12:50.537 --> 12:51.905
IS IF...

12:51.939 --> 12:54.041
I WERE TO COME
AND WORK WITH YOU.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.909
WHAT ABOUT C.U.?

12:55.943 --> 12:57.377
I RESIGNED.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.946
[LAUGHS]

12:58.979 --> 12:59.947
WAIT A SECOND, THAT'S BIG NEWS.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.281
WHY?

13:01.314 --> 13:04.251
I LOVE THE ART WORLD,
LIKE YOU SAID, AND, UH...

13:04.284 --> 13:06.820
I THINK I JUST MISSED
BEING IN THE TRENCHES.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.222
AND SO YOU WANT TO COME
WORK FOR ME?

13:09.256 --> 13:11.992
[LAUGHS]

13:12.025 --> 13:13.360
EXCUSE ME?

13:13.393 --> 13:15.963
OH, NOT IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.831
I MEAN, IF YOU THINK

13:17.865 --> 13:19.366
THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU WON
$50 MILLION IN SOME DIVORCE--

13:19.399 --> 13:20.500
$89--

13:20.533 --> 13:21.969
$89 MILLION.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.036
PLEASE DON'T FORGET THAT.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.137
WHATEVER.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.505
IF YOU THINK THAT IN ANY WAY
REMOTELY QUALIFIES YOU

13:25.538 --> 13:26.439
TO BE MY BOSS,

13:26.473 --> 13:30.343
WE COULD JUST AIR-KISS GOODBYE
RIGHT NOW.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.345
WHAT I'M OFFERING YOU...

13:32.379 --> 13:34.114
IS TO BE YOUR PARTNER.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.622
AND SHE SAID THAT YOU WERE
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.191
LOVE OF HER LIFE?

13:44.224 --> 13:45.358
ARE YOU FUCKING
KIDDING ME?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.294
HELENA...

13:47.327 --> 13:48.495
WHAT CAN WE
OFFER YOU

13:48.528 --> 13:50.430
IN THE WAY OF
PROTECTION?

13:50.463 --> 13:52.032
NOTHING.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.433
I'M FINE.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.368
LOOK, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN,

13:55.402 --> 13:56.536
ALL OF YOU.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.539
WELL, GO ON THEN.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.540
ARE YOU SURE?

14:00.573 --> 14:02.242
YES!

14:02.275 --> 14:03.043
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.244
SHE'S BEEN LIVING
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.246
SHE MOVED BACK
TO L.A.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.347
BECAUSE
HER DRAMATIC SHORT

14:07.380 --> 14:09.049
GOT ACCEPTED
INTO OUTFEST.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.283
OH, THAT'S RICH.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.285
SO SHE'S
A GAY FILMMAKER NOW?

14:12.319 --> 14:13.620
HERE'S HER CARD.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.026
OH, MY...

14:20.660 --> 14:23.196
"DO ASK, DO TELL
PRODUCTIONS?"

14:23.230 --> 14:24.431
OH, PLEASE...

14:24.464 --> 14:25.899
IT'S LIKE
SHE'S A BUZZARD,

14:25.933 --> 14:27.034
AND SHE'S WAITING
TO SWOOP DOWN

14:27.067 --> 14:28.435
AND EAT WHAT'S LEFT
OF YOUR CARCASS.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.070
LOVELY IMAGE, ALICE,
THANK YOU.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.504
GUYS, WE HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT SOMEONE

14:31.538 --> 14:32.605
WE CAN SET HER UP WITH.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.507
WHOA, NO, NO, NO.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.976
I DON'T WANT TO BE
FIXED UP WITH ANYBODY.

14:36.009 --> 14:36.977
SHH, WE'RE TRYING
TO THINK, JUST...

14:37.010 --> 14:37.978
JODI!

14:38.011 --> 14:38.979
[ALL GROANING]: NO...

14:39.012 --> 14:39.980
WHAT IS THIS,
RECYCLING?

14:40.013 --> 14:41.248
PLASTIC, PAPER,
LESBIANS?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.516
SOMEONE NEW,
SOMEONE FRESH.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.522
WHAT ABOUT JAMIE?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.391
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.026
MY GIRLFRIEND'S BRILLIANT.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.394
OF COURSE
SHE'S BRILLIANT!

14:54.427 --> 14:55.662
TELL US, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.564
WHO'S JAMIE?

14:57.597 --> 14:59.299
YOU GUYS, OKAY,
THIS GIRL IS SO...

14:59.332 --> 15:01.568
WE RECENTLY MET HER.
SHE'S RAD.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.403
WE WENT BOWLING
WITH HER.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.940
SHE'S THE DIRECTOR OF
YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES

15:06.974 --> 15:08.976
AT THE L.A.
GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.577
AND SHE IS
BEAUTIFUL.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.679
YEAH, AND SHE'S
VERY, VERY DEDICATED,

15:12.712 --> 15:14.314
WHICH IS GREAT.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.282
AND SHE'S SINGLE,

15:15.315 --> 15:17.117
WHICH, WE KNOW,
IS VERY RARE.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.586
SO I SEE
NOTHING WRONG.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.321
I THINK WE SHOULD...
I'M CALLING.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.389
I'M GOING TO DO
THIS THING.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.091
OH, WAIT, NO,
LET ME CALL HER.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.392
NO, I'LL CALL.
I GOT IT.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.060
SUDDENLY, I DON'T HAVE
A SAY IN THE MATTER?

15:27.094 --> 15:28.295
NO.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.131
SUCH A GOOD
IDEA...

15:32.699 --> 15:34.601
HEY, JAMIE,
IT'S ALICE.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.536
HI.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.338
I KNOW.
WE HAD A GOOD TIME, TOO.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.672
WHEN I DROPPED THE BALL?
I KNOW.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.108
[LAUGHS]

15:41.141 --> 15:43.010
UM, LISTEN,
I'M AT THE PLANET WITH TASHA,

15:43.043 --> 15:46.279
AND WE WERE

15:46.313 --> 15:47.247
ABOUT THIS
LITTLE IDEA

15:47.280 --> 15:49.249
I WANTED TO
RUN BY YOU.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.650
YEAH, NO, SHE'S HERE.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.985
YEAH. TASH...

15:52.019 --> 15:54.621

SAY SOMETHING.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.658
HELLO?

15:58.691 --> 16:01.628
HEY.

HELP YOU.

16:09.269 --> 16:10.403
I WILL.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.011
I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU BACK TO ALICE.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.746
OKAY, BYE.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.749
SHE JUST BOUGHT A '56
NORTON DOMINATOR.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.551
IT'S A MOTORCYCLE.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.153
OKAY, SO, UM,

16:26.186 --> 16:27.620
I WANT YOU
TO SAY YES, OKAY,

16:27.654 --> 16:30.157
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO
THANK ME AT YOUR WEDDING.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.491
WE WANT TO SET YOU UP

16:47.407 --> 16:48.441
OKAY,

16:56.283 --> 16:57.417
OKAY.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.451
NO, YOU'RE

16:58.485 --> 16:59.486
LOVE HER.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.553
NO, I'M SURE I AM.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.821
YOU TWO ARE SO EXCITED
ABOUT HER.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.123
DEFINITELY, I WILL.

I HAVE A REALLY GOOD
FEELING ABOUT THIS...

17:15.735 --> 17:16.803
NO, I THINK IT'S
GOING TO BE

17:16.836 --> 17:18.171
A LOT OF FUN.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.576
[**]

17:28.648 --> 17:31.284
OKAY, SO IT'S CALLED
"CLUTTER-CLEARING," RIGHT,

17:31.318 --> 17:34.121
AND THE CONCEPT IS
THAT YOU CLEAR OUT

17:34.154 --> 17:36.189
YOUR HOUSE
AND YOUR LIFE,

17:36.223 --> 17:37.824
AND IT'S A REALLY
GOOD THING TO DO

17:37.857 --> 17:38.825
WHEN YOU'RE STARTING
A NEW PROJECT

17:38.858 --> 17:40.227
OR A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.429
OR WHEN YOU WANT TO
GET RID OF YOUR SHIT.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.464
SO HERE YOU GO.

17:44.497 --> 17:45.532
[SIGHS]

17:45.565 --> 17:46.533
OKAY.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.634
I THOUGHT THAT
WE COULD START

17:47.667 --> 17:48.635
IN MY CLOSET.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.636
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

17:49.669 --> 17:52.305
I DON'T THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH
TO GET RID OF,

17:52.339 --> 17:54.807
BUT I'M SURE
THERE'S A FEW THINGS IN HERE

17:54.841 --> 17:58.111
THAT I CAN STAND
TO GET RID OF.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.346
OKAY.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.348
COME ON.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.383
ALL RIGHT.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.418
I'LL HOLD YOUR BAG.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.553
NO, NO, NO,
YOU HAVE TO PARTICIPATE.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.554
OH, COME ON--

18:07.587 --> 18:09.289
IT'S SYMBOLIC.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.424

CHOICES, SHANE.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.126
OKAY?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.427
I WILL START.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.364
FOR EXAMPLE,

18:17.397 --> 18:21.134
THIS REMINDS ME
OF MY JEAN SEBERG LOOK,

18:21.168 --> 18:24.304
WHICH I AM NOT THAT INTO
ANYMORE.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.706
I LIKE THE JEAN SEBERG LOOK.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.141

18:28.175 --> 18:30.677
WELL, YOUR TURN.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.279
OH, COME ON,
THAT'S NOT MY PLACE.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.846
OF COURSE IT'S YOUR PLACE!

18:33.880 --> 18:38.151
JUST TELL ME WHAT REPRESENTS
A FACET OF MY PERSONALITY

18:38.185 --> 18:40.187
THAT I SHOULD JUST BE
GETTING RID OF.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.821
[LAUGHS IN DISBELIEF]

18:41.854 --> 18:43.356
SHOULD I...

18:43.390 --> 18:44.691
THAT'S A TRICKY QUESTION.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.825
OKAY, OKAY, I'LL DO IT AGAIN.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.294
OKAY, ME.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.162
UM...

18:49.196 --> 18:50.297
FOR EXAMPLE,

18:50.330 --> 18:55.468
THESE REMIND ME
OF TIM, RIGHT?

18:55.502 --> 18:58.705
OF MY POST-COLLEGE MENTALITY.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.873
WHEN I WAS STILL, YOU KNOW,

19:00.907 --> 19:02.442
IN MY STUDENT WORLD,
RIGHT?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.244
IT WAS ALSO
IN YOUR STRAIGHT MENTALITY.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.216
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.350
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.518
UM...

19:13.653 --> 19:15.388
AH, HOW ABOUT THIS?

19:15.422 --> 19:16.556
OH...

19:16.589 --> 19:17.790

I REALLY DO.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.926
WASN'T THIS DURING YOU'RE...

19:19.959 --> 19:21.261
THE TIME YOU ELOPED?

19:21.294 --> 19:24.931
OH, THAT REMINDS ME
OF MARINA.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.233
OH, JESUS,
MARINA--

19:26.266 --> 19:27.667
NO, SERIOUSLY,
SHE WAS MY FIRST LOVE.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.302
AND NO ONE UNDERSTOOD WHY.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.438
OKAY.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.506
SERIOUSLY, TELL ME
WHAT I SHOULD GET RID OF--

19:33.540 --> 19:34.741
AH, GOD...

CHANGING PEOPLE.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.718
NOT REALLY--

19:45.752 --> 19:47.520
I MEAN, YOU REALLY
COULD GET RID OF HALF OF THIS

19:47.554 --> 19:49.322
AND STILL HAVE SO MUCH MORE.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.557
OH, THIS SHIT.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.591
NO!

19:51.624 --> 19:52.859
YOU NEVER USE THIS.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.328

NO WAY!

19:55.362 --> 19:56.429
DO YOU KNOW
THAT ONE DAY,

19:56.463 --> 19:57.697
A FOUNDATION
IS GOING TO WANT

19:57.730 --> 19:59.932
ALL THESE LITTLE
BITS AND PIECES?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.301

YOU HAVEN'T USED THESE

20:01.334 --> 20:02.769
SINCE WE'VE BEEN
LIVING TOGETHER.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.971
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I WON'T START, OKAY?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.506
LET'S PUT THESE BACK.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.740
ALL RIGHT.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.377
OKAY, WHAT ELSE?

20:10.410 --> 20:11.444

20:11.478 --> 20:12.479

20:12.512 --> 20:13.513
OH, GOD.
ALL RIGHT, OKAY...

20:13.546 --> 20:15.382
THAT'S DESIGNER.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.516
WHAT ELSE? COME ON--

20:16.549 --> 20:17.717
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.952
I'M JUST NOT OKAY WITH IT.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.288
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.424
I THOUGHT
WE GOT THROUGH THIS.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.892
OH, YEAH, WE JUST
SOARED OVER YOU

20:25.925 --> 20:27.327

AS YOUR
BUSINESS PARTNER.

20:30.863 --> 20:31.798
YOU KNOW WHAT, TINA,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.433
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

20:33.466 --> 20:34.601
ON PROBATION.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.935
I'M JUST NOT.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.971

20:39.005 --> 20:40.407
I'M SORRY.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.841
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.976
WE DON'T NEED
ALL THAT.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.913
I TOLD ANGIE THREE BOOKS
AND THREE VIDEOS.

20:46.946 --> 20:47.914
THREE BOOKS
ISN'T ENOUGH.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.582
YES, IT IS.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.983
YOU KNOW SHE GOES THROUGH
THREE BOOKS SO QUICKLY.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.352
WHAT ABOUT HAMMY?

20:52.385 --> 20:54.321
IT'S JUST
ONE NIGHT, BETTE.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.755
I'M SURE
SHE'LL BE FINE.

20:57.557 --> 20:58.691
I DON'T WANT HER TO MISS HIM.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.628
OKAY, FINE.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.433
YOU KNOW, I JUST...

21:06.466 --> 21:08.768
I WISH YOU HAD TALKED TO ME
ABOUT IT FIRST, THAT'S ALL.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.437
I WOULD HAVE.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.604
I JUST, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT I WAS GOING TO PROPOSE IT.

21:11.638 --> 21:12.605
IT JUST--

21:12.639 --> 21:13.606
IT'S A HUGE DECISION,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.675
YOU GETTING BACK INTO
THE GALLERY BUSINESS.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.710
I KNOW, BUT IT'S WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE MOST.

21:17.744 --> 21:18.811
I KNOW, I KNOW.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.980
IT'S JUST...

21:21.013 --> 21:23.316
IT'S REALLY SCARY RIGHT NOW,

21:23.350 --> 21:24.717

UNDER CONSTRUCTION,

21:24.751 --> 21:27.720
AND MY JOB'S NOT EXACTLY SECURE.

THAT'S WHY IT COMES
AS SUCH A GREAT TIME.

MAKE ME A PARTNER.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.462

IT'S ALREADY A DONE DEAL.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.429
WELL, I'M HOPING IT IS.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.598

A BUSINESS DECISION, TINA.

21:38.631 --> 21:42.001
YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU DON'T
BELIEVE THAT, THEN...

21:42.034 --> 21:44.704
I SUGGEST YOU COME UP WITH
A BETTER SOLUTION.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.980

MOST OF MY STUFF LAST YEAR

21:54.013 --> 21:56.883

THAT WE WOULDN'T EVEN
CONSIDER GETTING MARRIED

AND COMPLETE EQUAL RIGHTS

30:00.266 --> 30:01.901

THINK ABOUT--

38:05.717 --> 38:08.019
SHE TOOK THEM AND MOVED
TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.455
YOU ONLY SEE

44:44.449 --> 44:46.317
NOTHING.

44:49.921 --> 44:51.890
I DON'T GET WHY
YOU'RE SO PISSED AT ME.

44:51.923 --> 44:54.125
I'M NOT PISSED,
I'M JUST TIRED.

45:06.838 --> 45:11.042
YOU LOOKED HOT AT THE CLUB.

45:11.076 --> 45:12.243
ALL THESE GUYS
WERE CHECKING YOU OUT.

45:12.277 --> 45:14.045
GUYS WERE
CHECKING YOU OUT, TOO.

45:14.079 --> 45:15.814
YEAH.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.783
THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF I WAS PREGNANT

45:17.816 --> 45:20.085
OR JUST FAT.

45:20.118 --> 45:21.419
YOU KNOW,
IT'S GETTING OLD, MAX.

45:21.452 --> 45:23.254
YOU PUTTING YOURSELF DOWN
ALL THE TIME.

46:10.435 --> 46:12.904
YOU'RE RIGHT.

46:16.541 --> 46:19.510
I'LL TRY NOT TO BE
SO SELF-DEPRECATING.

46:39.998 --> 46:41.566
15 MORE MINUTES, HONEY.

46:41.599 --> 46:42.834
YEAH? OKAY.

46:42.868 --> 46:44.836
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
YEAH?

46:44.870 --> 46:46.337
OKAY.

46:50.108 --> 46:52.143
[SIGHING]

46:52.177 --> 46:53.544
DON'T BE DISCOURAGED.

46:53.578 --> 46:56.347
WE'RE STILL ON THE LIST.

46:56.381 --> 46:57.949
I'M SURE
WE'LL FIND A BABY

46:57.983 --> 47:00.952
THAT'S MEANT TO BE
A PART OF OUR FAMILY.

47:00.986 --> 47:04.489
I'M JUST STUNNED
BY THE IGNORANCE.

47:04.522 --> 47:08.126
YEAH, WELL, WELCOME TO
THE REST OF AMERICA.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.228
I THINK MAYBE
WE DODGED A BULLET.

47:10.261 --> 47:13.331
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

47:13.364 --> 47:14.499
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST...

47:14.532 --> 47:15.600
I'M HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS

47:15.633 --> 47:18.136
ABOUT THE ADOPTION.

47:22.340 --> 47:23.541
I JUST, YOU KNOW...

47:23.574 --> 47:25.276
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

47:25.310 --> 47:27.979
THAT ARE JUST
OUT OF OUR CONTROL.

47:28.013 --> 47:29.080
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

47:29.114 --> 47:29.847
EVERYTHING'S
OUT OF OUR CONTROL.

47:31.983 --> 47:35.620
BUT EVERY BABY
HAS A GENETIC IMPRINT.

47:35.653 --> 47:37.022
YOU KNOW,
WHETHER WE LIKE OR NOT,

47:37.055 --> 47:38.156
AND THE FACT IS,

47:38.189 --> 47:40.025
WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT MARCI.

47:40.058 --> 47:41.292
NOT REALLY.

47:41.326 --> 47:43.494
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS BABY'S FATHER,

47:43.528 --> 47:46.164
AND WITH THAT FAMILY'S HISTORY,

47:46.197 --> 47:49.200
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE
INVITING THAT INTO...

47:49.234 --> 47:51.102
I DON'T WANT TO BE
EXPOSING ANGELICA

47:51.136 --> 47:52.503
TO THAT WAY OF THINKING.

47:55.006 --> 47:58.009
THIS WILL BE OUR BABY.

47:58.043 --> 48:01.179
I THINK WE'LL HAVE
A GREAT INFLUENCE ON ITS LIFE.

48:01.212 --> 48:02.147
OF COURSE WE WILL.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.582
I'M JUST TRYING
TO TALK HONESTLY WITH YOU.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.117
THIS IS JUST MY RESPONSE
TO WHAT HAPPENED TODAY--

48:06.151 --> 48:08.586
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

48:13.524 --> 48:14.625
WHO IS IT?

48:14.659 --> 48:16.661
IT'S MARCI!

48:19.164 --> 48:20.331
HI.

48:20.365 --> 48:22.100
HI.

48:22.133 --> 48:23.568
I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND.

48:23.601 --> 48:25.103
I WAS GOING TO CALL,

48:25.136 --> 48:27.338
BUT I DIDN'T WANT BOB
AND MY MOM TO HEAR, SO...

48:27.372 --> 48:28.974
IT'S FINE.

48:29.007 --> 48:30.241
WHY DON'T YOU
COME IN?

48:30.275 --> 48:31.309
COME SIT DOWN.

48:31.342 --> 48:33.178
OKAY, YEAH.
THANKS.

48:37.448 --> 48:41.119
UH, I JUST WANTED TO...

48:41.152 --> 48:43.021
UH, I JUST REALLY...

48:43.054 --> 48:45.190
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

48:45.223 --> 48:47.558
MY PARENTS
DON'T APPROVE IT.

48:47.592 --> 48:51.396
THEY DON'T APPROVE OF
LOTS OF STUFF, SO...

48:51.429 --> 48:53.498
WE UNDERSTAND.

48:53.531 --> 48:55.300
THESE THINGS
HAPPEN.

48:55.333 --> 48:58.536
YEAH, UM,
BUT I REALLY DON'T CARE.

48:58.569 --> 49:01.239
I MEAN, THIS IS MY BODY,
AND MY BABY,

49:01.272 --> 49:05.176
AND MY DECISION, AND...

49:05.210 --> 49:08.179
YOU'RE THE FAMILY
THAT I WANT MY BABY TO GO TO.

49:13.718 --> 49:15.386
ARE YOU SURE?

49:15.420 --> 49:19.424
YEAH.

49:24.695 --> 49:28.133
HAVE YOU MET, UM,
THE OTHER TWO COUPLES?

49:28.166 --> 49:29.467
YEAH,
I MET THEM.

49:29.500 --> 49:30.501
I MEAN, THEY'RE FINE.

49:30.535 --> 49:32.237
I JUST...

49:32.270 --> 49:34.005
I DON'T LIKE THEM
AS MUCH AS I LIKE YOU GUYS.

49:34.039 --> 49:36.574
THEY'RE JUST NOT
AS INTERESTING,

49:36.607 --> 49:38.776
AND THIS BABY, HE'S...

49:38.809 --> 49:41.512
GOING TO HAVE
AN INTERESTING LIFE.

49:41.546 --> 49:45.116
HE?

49:45.150 --> 49:48.719
YEAH,
IT'S A BOY,

49:48.753 --> 49:50.255
WHICH IS
ANOTHER REASON

49:50.288 --> 49:54.092
WHY I WANT YOU
TO BE HIS PARENTS.

'CAUSE THIS WORLD
NEEDS BOYS

DO THINGS...

49:58.529 --> 50:03.401
AND I REALLY WANT MY BABY
TO HAVE A CHANCE AT THAT,

AT MAKING THIS WORLD, YOU KNOW,
JUST A LITTLE BETTER.
