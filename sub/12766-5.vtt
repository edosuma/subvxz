09:38.125 --> 09:41.500
UM... I SAW SOMETHING

09:41.542 --> 09:44.041
ABOUT THIS DRUG.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.417
THEY SAID IT WORKED
FOR SOME KATRINA VICTIMS.

09:46.458 --> 09:49.041
WHAT KIND OF DRUG?

09:49.083 --> 09:51.542
IT MAKES YOU FORGET

AND IT'S GONE?

10:27.125 --> 10:29.250
NO, I NEED TO DO
A FULL PELVIC EXAM.

10:29.291 --> 10:30.750

THERE'S NO BUTS.

10:30.792 --> 10:33.458

RULE OUT CHLAMYDIA.

10:36.542 --> 10:37.583
BESIDES...

10:37.625 --> 10:39.291
(metal scraping)

10:39.333 --> 10:41.291
IF YOU'RE ENGAGING IN SEX...
(pats examination table)

10:41.333 --> 10:43.291
YOU NEED TO BE GETTING
REGULAR CHECKUPS.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.375
THAT'S THE RESPONSIBLE WAY
TO BEHAVE.

10:45.417 --> 10:49.458
ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE RESPONSIBLE AT 13, MAYA.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.458
(sighs)

10:51.500 --> 10:54.583
HONEY, LOOK AT ME.

10:54.625 --> 10:56.417
ARE YOU...

10:56.458 --> 10:58.291
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.667
DID YOU DO THIS
BECAUSE A BOY...

11:00.709 --> 11:03.166
ARE YOU BEING PRESSURED
BECAUSE--

11:03.208 --> 11:05.208
I'M NOT A LITTLE KID.

11:10.417 --> 11:13.083
HEY, UM, MRS. WORTH
IS HERE FOR HER YEARLY.

11:13.125 --> 11:16.083
THIS IS THE ONE I'M DOING,
RIGHT? THIS IS MINE?
IT'S PAP TIME, DELL.
GET PAPPING.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.291
BUT YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE THERE?

11:18.333 --> 11:21.208
JUST ASK HER IF SHE WANTS
A FEMALE CHAPERONE PRESENT

11:21.250 --> 11:23.208
BEFORE YOU LAY
A FINGER ON HER.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.250
ALSO RELAX.
PATIENTS CAN SMELL FEAR.

11:25.291 --> 11:27.250
KEEP THE SPECULUM WARM
AND TELL THE PATIENTS

11:27.291 --> 11:29.250
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING
BEFORE YOU DO IT.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.375
AND INTRODUCE YOURSELF.
DOCTORS ALWAYS FORGET THAT.

11:31.417 --> 11:34.458
NO, I-I ACED BEDSIDE MANNER.
I'M GONNA GIVE A HAPPY PAP.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.333
NO WORRIES.
GOOD, GOOD.
UM, WHERE'S SAM?

11:36.375 --> 11:39.125
HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
AND NAOMI'S IN THE BACK?

11:39.166 --> 11:41.125
YOU DON'T THINK I NEED HELP,
RIGHT? I DON'T NEED HELP?

11:41.166 --> 11:42.417
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.625
I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

11:44.667 --> 11:48.208
HELLO. I'M DELL PARKER.
AND I'LL BE DOING--

11:48.250 --> 11:49.583
NO.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.458
GET THE CHECKED NAPKINS,
THE RED AND WHITE KIND.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.250
THEY TOLD ME
I WAS GETTING A NURSE.
I-I AM.
I-I HAVE MY NURSING DEGREE,

11:55.291 --> 11:57.250
AND--AND I'M ABOUT
TO BE CERTIFIED AS--

11:57.291 --> 11:59.375
THEY SENT ME A BOY NURSE.
I KNOW.

11:59.417 --> 12:01.000
UM, I JUST--EXCUSE ME.

12:01.041 --> 12:02.709
I-I NEED TO ASK IF YOU'D LIKE
A FEMALE CHAPERONE PRESENT

12:02.750 --> 12:04.417
FOR THE EXAM.

12:04.458 --> 12:07.166
NO, JUST DO IT. I GOTTA
PICK UP MY DAUGHTER FROM BALLET.

12:07.208 --> 12:08.291
ALL RIGHT.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.500
OKAY.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.291
I DON'T KNOW.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.458
HE'S LIKE 5 YEARS OLD.
YEAH.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.667
I'LL JUST GET THIS...
FOR YOU.

12:18.709 --> 12:20.458
OKAY.
(metal clangs)

12:20.500 --> 12:23.291
HE JUST DROPPED THE THING.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY,
THAT HAPPENS.

12:23.333 --> 12:26.166
THE THING. YEAH.
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.291
YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE THAT?
UH, NO, A NEW ONE.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.250
I'M--I'M GETTING A NEW ONE.
I'M GETTING A NEW ONE.

12:31.291 --> 12:34.333
OKAY, NOT A--NOT A HAPPY PAP.
NOT A HAPPY PAP.

12:36.333 --> 12:39.333
(treadmill squeaking)

12:41.333 --> 12:43.458
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE WORKING HARD.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.208
EVEN WITH A COLD, THIS PACE
SHOULD BE A PIECE OF CAKE.

12:46.250 --> 12:47.500
I GOT AN AUDIENCE.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.417
JUST WANTED TO SEE

12:49.458 --> 12:51.417
NICOLE CLEMMONS
RUN IN PERSON ONCE

12:51.458 --> 12:54.500
BEFORE SHE'S ON
MY WHEATIES BOX.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.625
I'VE DONE SOME MARATHONS.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.542
NICOLE, THIS IS
DR. CHARLOTTE KING.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.291
SHE DOES MARATHONS.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.291
(panting)

13:04.333 --> 13:07.250
(monitor beeping)

13:07.291 --> 13:09.375
UH, YOU SHOULD STOP.
I JUST GOTTA PUSH THROUGH.

13:09.417 --> 13:12.583
NO, THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
GET OFF. STOP.

13:19.792 --> 13:22.291
THEY BEEN IN THERE
WAY TOO LONG.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.458
THEY ARE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.542
NO.

13:25.583 --> 13:27.750
(clears throat)

13:30.542 --> 13:33.333
(whispers)
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANKS.

13:33.375 --> 13:34.750
MM-HMM. MM.

13:34.792 --> 13:37.458
(normal voice) FRIENDS.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.375
WHAT?

13:39.417 --> 13:41.500
ALLAN--
HE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS.

13:41.542 --> 13:42.917
WE'RE HAVING COFFEE.
OH, COME ON, VIOLET.

13:42.959 --> 13:45.625
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES FRIENDS
CAN MEAN JUST FRIENDS.

13:45.667 --> 13:49.417
I MEAN,
LOOK AT ME AND NAOMI.
OH, YOU TWO
ARE SO NOT FRIENDS.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.709
YEAH, YOU GUYS ARE MORE
LIKE A CORPORATION.
A CORPORATION.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.375
WE ARE HANDLING
A REALLY TOUGH SITUATION

13:54.417 --> 13:57.375
WITH, UH, MATURITY--
YOU KNOW, HE--
HE APOLOGIZED FOR HURTING ME.

13:57.417 --> 14:00.625
HE JUST MISSES
OUR CONVERSATIONS.
ALLAN ALWAYS BLOWS IN,

14:00.667 --> 14:02.500
HE MAKES YOU FEEL ALL GOOD,

14:02.542 --> 14:04.834
AND THEN HE HURTS YOU
WORSE THAN THE LAST TIME,

14:04.875 --> 14:07.500
AND I PICK UP THE PIECES.
SORRY, UH, TO INTERR--
I NEED--CAN I GET, UH...

14:07.542 --> 14:10.291
I NEED TO BORROW YOU
FOR A CONSULT.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.375
GLADLY.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.750
GET HELP.

14:12.792 --> 14:14.333
HEY...

14:14.375 --> 14:16.542
I... ALLAN--ALLAN WANTS
TO BE FRIENDS.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.542
THAT'S HEALTHY.
WE'RE MOVING ON. WE'RE--
NO, NO, NO.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.542
IF--IF--IF COOPER
DOESN'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO IT,

14:20.583 --> 14:21.834
THEN NEITHER DO I.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.333
NOW I HAVE THIS PATIENT--
BETH BURTON.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.542
SHE INTERRUPTED
A ROBBERY IN HER HOME,

14:26.583 --> 14:27.834
AND SHE'S INTERESTED
IN A DRUG

14:27.875 --> 14:29.542
USED ON POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS
PATIENTS.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.417
PROPRANOLOL,
THE BETA BLOCKER.

14:31.458 --> 14:34.834
SO THEN IT'S FOR REAL?
UH, IT'S CONTROVERSIAL,
BUT YEAH, IT'S REAL.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.834
IT--IT--IT BLUNTS
THE PHYSICAL RESPONSE

14:36.875 --> 14:39.333
TO THE MEMORY CONSOLIDATION
OF THE TRAUMA.

14:39.375 --> 14:40.834
SO THEN YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY FORGET?

14:40.875 --> 14:43.750
IT MORE, UM, LESSENS
THE FEAR AND PANIC

14:43.792 --> 14:46.458
WHEN YOU DO REMEMBER.
WILL YOU TALK TO HER WITH ME,

14:46.500 --> 14:48.917
MAKE SURE SHE'S REALLY
A CANDIDATE?
YEAH, SURE.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.834
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.667
HEY, UH, SAM, UM...

14:53.709 --> 14:56.667
IF I WERE TO WEAR A SKIRT
TO HAVE COFFEE WITH ALLAN,

14:56.709 --> 14:59.375
WOULD THAT MEAN
"I WANT TO GET WITH YOU?"

14:59.417 --> 15:01.709
NOT THAT I WANT THAT.

15:01.750 --> 15:04.834
I'M ASKING BECAUSE I DON'T.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.834
(Cooper) LITTLE MAYA.
LITTLE SWEET, INNOCENT MAYA.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.500
OH--FROM THE CHRISTMAS CARD

15:09.542 --> 15:11.625
AND THE ONESIE WITH
THE PACIFIER AND THE DROOL--

15:11.667 --> 15:13.875
SWEET, INNOCENT DROOL--
AND...

15:13.917 --> 15:15.917
GOD KNOWS
WHERE THAT'S BEEN NOW.

15:15.959 --> 15:19.500
WHY ME? WHY DID MAYA
HAVE TO COME TO ME?

15:19.542 --> 15:21.750
OH, POOR NAOMI.

15:21.792 --> 15:24.458
I JUST RAN AN S.T.D. TEST
ON HER 13 YEAR OLD.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.458
I MEAN,
HOW DO I TELL HER THAT?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.417
CALIFORNIA HAS STRICT
PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY LAWS,

15:28.458 --> 15:30.417
ESPECIALLY FOR MINORS.
I KNOW.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.709
BUT HOW CAN I
KEEP SOMETHING LIKE THIS

15:32.750 --> 15:34.417
FROM SAM AND NAOMI?

15:34.458 --> 15:36.542
SHE'S EVERYTHING TO THEM.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.834
MAYA DOESN'T NEED FOR YOU
TO TELL HER PARENTS.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.500
WHAT SHE NEEDS
IS SOMEONE SHE CAN TRUST.

15:41.542 --> 15:43.417
MAYA COULD USE A FRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.417
SO YOU BE HER FRIEND,
ADDISON.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.875
YOU GIVE HER
WHAT HER PARENTS CAN'T.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.458
NICOLE, YOU HAVE
SEVERE BRONCHOSPASM.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.750
YOUR OXYGEN LEVELS ARE DROPPING
DANGEROUSLY LOW WHEN YOU RUN.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.458
YOU'LL NEED INHALED STEROIDS
AND CONTINUOUS NEB.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.792
I CAN'T USE THOSE.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.792
I HAVE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS
COMING UP.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.709
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT
TO STICK WITH HERBS,

16:02.750 --> 16:04.792
BUT AT THIS POINT,
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.667
YOU CANNOT COMPETE AGAIN UNTIL
YOU GET THIS UNDER CONTROL.
WHAT?

16:07.709 --> 16:10.667
IF YOU LISTEN TO DR. WILDER,
LET HIM GET YOU STABILIZED,

16:10.709 --> 16:12.000
YOU WILL RACE AGAIN.

16:12.041 --> 16:13.709
BUT NOT YET.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.917
THIS IS
AN OLYMPIC QUALIFYING MEET.

16:15.959 --> 16:18.750
THE CONDITION YOU'RE IN,
IF YOU RUN TOO HARD,

16:18.792 --> 16:21.750
YOU PUSH TOO HARD,
IF YOU EVEN WALK TOO HARD,

16:21.792 --> 16:23.583
YOU COULD DIE.

16:34.041 --> 16:35.083
(whimpers)

16:35.125 --> 16:39.208
♪♪♪

16:39.250 --> 16:41.208
OKAY, HERE SHE IS.
GOOD MORNING.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.041
HEY.
HEY.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.125
JUST A-ASK HER.

16:44.166 --> 16:46.041
OKAY.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.041
WHAT DID YOU MEAN
THE OTHER DAY

16:48.083 --> 16:50.208
WHEN YOU SAID YOU...
DON'T DO THAT?

16:50.250 --> 16:53.917
THAT I DON'T DO THAT.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.041
YOU DON'T... YOU...

16:55.083 --> 16:57.041
YOU ACTUALLY DO NOT DO...

16:57.083 --> 17:01.083
YOU--YOU PHYSICALLY,
ACTUALLY... DO NOT DO THAT?

17:01.125 --> 17:05.041
I DON'T DO THAT.
I FEEL LIKE SHE'S SPEAKING
CZECH OR MANDARIN.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.166
I'M NOT A PRUDE.

17:06.208 --> 17:08.208
IT'S JUST...
I'M FROM CONNECTICUT.

17:08.250 --> 17:12.041
AND--AND BESIDES, FOR ME,
SEX IS A 2-PLAYER GAME.

17:12.083 --> 17:15.041
THE SOLO THING JUST DOESN'T
CUT IT FOR ME.

17:15.083 --> 17:17.959
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
SHOWERHEAD MASSAGER.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.041
WHAT ABOUT MAYA?

17:20.083 --> 17:22.041
I-I WOULD THINK
AS A MOTHER--

17:22.083 --> 17:25.959
A MOTHER WITH A VERY EXPENSIVE
SHOWERHEAD MASSAGER.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.041
LOOK, FIRST... SELF-PLEASURE
IS A FEMININE RIGHT.

17:29.083 --> 17:32.041
AS A SINGLE WOMAN, SEX CANNOT
ALWAYS BE A 2-PLAYER GAME

17:32.083 --> 17:34.000
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
GET DESPERATE,

17:34.041 --> 17:35.166
AND YOU'RE GONNA PLAY
WITH THE WRONG GUY.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.041
PETE.
PETE IS THE WRONG GUY.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.041
RIGHT. NO. EXCEPT IN
YOUR FANTASIES. HE'S FINE.

17:39.083 --> 17:42.000
YOU KNOW,
DO HIM IN DREAM LAND.

17:42.041 --> 17:44.083
SO YOU'RE SAYING TO AVOID
HAVING SEX WITH PETE,

17:44.125 --> 17:47.041
I NEED TO HAVE
"SEX WITH PETE"?

17:47.083 --> 17:50.041
NO, YOU NEED TO HAVE SEX
WITH YOURSELF.
(Violet) YEAH, PETE IS MORE
JUST LIKE A...

17:50.083 --> 17:53.291
HELPING HAND.
PLEASE STOP TALKING.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.250
UH, BETH BURTON IS HERE.

17:55.291 --> 17:59.041
YES, I'M... (clears throat)
I'M COMING RIGHT AWAY.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.041
WE WERE JUST--

18:01.083 --> 18:03.000
AH, NO. DON'T--
DON'T EXPLAIN.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.041
I DON'T... I--MM.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.291
HE'S GONNA TELL PETE.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.250
HE'S GONNA TELL PETE.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.250
(Addison) HEY, UM...

18:12.291 --> 18:14.125
HOW'S, UH...

18:14.166 --> 18:16.125
HOW'S MAYA DOING?

18:16.166 --> 18:18.333
I MEAN, SHE SEEMS SO...
GROWN-UP.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.250
YOU KNOW, AFTER THE DIVORCE
AND--

18:20.291 --> 18:23.041
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I THINK SHE KINDA DIGS

18:23.083 --> 18:25.291
HAVING DIVORCED PARENTS.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.250
YOU KNOW, LIKE, TWO HOUSES
AND DOUBLE THE CLOTHES.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.291
YOU KNOW? SHE'S GOOD.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.041
RIGHT.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.125
HI.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.041
HI.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.041
(whispers) WHAT,
ARE YOU WATCHING ME NOW?

18:39.083 --> 18:41.041
WHAT, DOES ADDISON NOT THINK
I CAN DO THIS?

18:41.083 --> 18:42.166
'CAUSE I CAN DO THIS.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.333
(whispers) I'M JUST OBSERVING.
NOW GO. DO THIS.

18:44.375 --> 18:46.291
(normal voice) OKAY.
OKAY.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.083
OKAY, SO, UM, WHAT I'M
GOING TO DO IS, UH...

18:49.125 --> 18:51.166
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO--

18:51.208 --> 18:53.041
YOU'RE CUTE.
HE'S CUTE, RIGHT?

18:53.083 --> 18:56.041
LET'S JUST, UH,
FOCUS ON THE EXAM, OKAY?

18:56.083 --> 18:58.041
OKAY, SO, UM, SORRY.

18:58.083 --> 19:01.041
I'M, UH, GONNA TELL YOU
THE NAMES OF STUFF--
IS HE ALLOWED
TO BE THIS CUTE?

19:01.083 --> 19:03.125
(whispers) IS SHE ALLOWED
TO ASK ME THAT?
SHE'S ALLOWED TO ASK IT,

19:03.166 --> 19:05.083
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO PAY ANY ATTENTION,

19:05.125 --> 19:07.083
SO JUST KEEP GOING.
OKAY. OKAY.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.041
UH, NO.
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.250
YOU'RE WAY TOO CUTE.

19:10.291 --> 19:12.291
(normal voice) NO, NO.
I'M NOT. I'M NOT.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.291
I'M UGLY. YOU KNOW, I-I-I HAVE
MOLES IN WEIRD PLACES.
NO.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.041
SO JUST--JUST LET ME--
UNH-UNH.

19:18.083 --> 19:21.041
I'D BE HAVING ALL THESE
THOUGHTS ABOUT YOUR EYES

19:21.083 --> 19:23.041
AND STUFF.

19:23.083 --> 19:25.041
NO, NO WAY
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME.

19:25.083 --> 19:30.041
UNLESS YOU WANT
TO TOUCH ME.
OKAY, DELL, I THINK
I CAN HANDLE THIS ONE.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.166
I WOULD LIKE TO TRY
SOME THERAPY SESSIONS

19:32.208 --> 19:34.291
BEFORE WE EVEN CONSIDER
USING THE PROPRANOLOL.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.041
WHY CAN'T WE
JUST USE THE DRUG?

19:37.083 --> 19:38.417
WELL, EVEN IF YOU WERE
TO TAKE IT,

19:38.458 --> 19:40.417
IT WOULD STILL INVOLVE
SESSIONS WITH VIOLET.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.041
RIGHT. I WOULD WALK YOU THROUGH
THE DETAILS OF THE EVENT

19:43.083 --> 19:45.041
AFTER THE DRUG
HAS TAKEN EFFECT.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.417
ALL THE DETAILS?
RIGHT.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.166
I, UH, I-I CAN'T DO THAT.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.208
I KNOW--
I KNOW IT CAN BE SCARY.

19:51.250 --> 19:54.250
NO, NO.
I CAN'T... DO THAT.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.000
WAIT, BETH.

20:02.166 --> 20:05.125
HEY.

20:05.166 --> 20:09.458
I GOT YOUR TEST RESULTS BACK.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.041
YOU DON'T HAVE GONORRHEA.

20:12.083 --> 20:14.041
REALLY?

20:14.083 --> 20:15.375
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

20:15.417 --> 20:18.458
BUT COULD I GET SOME
OF THOSE PILLS FOR THE GUY?

20:18.500 --> 20:22.291
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
NO, HE HAS TO SEE A DOCTOR.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.375
MAYA... CAN I ASK,

20:25.417 --> 20:30.500
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING SEX?

20:30.542 --> 20:33.375
MM, I DON'T KNOW.

20:33.417 --> 20:36.375
A YEAR?

20:36.417 --> 20:39.041
OKAY.

20:39.083 --> 20:42.250
A YEAR AND... THE BOY?

20:42.291 --> 20:44.291
WELL, THERE'S A COUPLE
OF BOYS.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.166
A COUPLE OF BOYS?
NOT THAT I'M JUDGING.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.458
FRIENDS DON'T JUDGE.

20:48.500 --> 20:51.041
JUST...

20:51.083 --> 20:54.041
JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
GET AN S.T.D. NOW

20:54.083 --> 20:56.125
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU WON'T GET ONE,

20:56.166 --> 20:58.500
NOT TO MENTION THE RISK
FOR H.I.V., PREGNANCY--

20:58.542 --> 21:00.375
I USE CONDOMS.

21:00.417 --> 21:02.041
THEY'RE NOT 100% EFFECTIVE

21:02.083 --> 21:04.291
IN PREVENTING DISEASE
AND PREGNANCY.

21:04.333 --> 21:06.041
THEY'RE NOT?

21:06.083 --> 21:08.208
MAYA...

21:08.250 --> 21:10.542
SEX AT YOUR AGE--

21:10.583 --> 21:13.542
HEY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE HERE ALREADY.

21:13.583 --> 21:16.041
SHE'S NOT BUGGING YOU,
IS SHE?

21:16.083 --> 21:18.208
NO. SHE'S, UH, NO.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.125
I JUST--I JUST WANTED
TO SAY HI TO AUNT ADDISON.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.041
WELL, SAY GOOD-BYE
TO AUNT ADDISON.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.333
YOU'VE GOT VIOLIN.
COME ON.
OKAY.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.375
GOOD-BYE, AUNT ADDISON.
BYE.

21:37.166 --> 21:40.125
BEER?
SUDSY, RELAXING BEER?

21:40.166 --> 21:43.500
VIOLET IS HAVING COFFEE
WITH ALLAN TONIGHT.

21:43.542 --> 21:46.166
I DESERVE BEER BEFORE I HAVE TO
WIPE HER OFF THE FLOOR.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.083
I'M GOING TO THE TRACK
TO SEE COACH MIKE.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.458
HOW'D HE TAKE IT WHEN YOU
TOLD HIM HE HAD TO BENCH

21:50.500 --> 21:52.333
NICOLE CLEMMONS?
HE HASN'T RETURNED MY CALLS.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.375
ANYWAY, SHE'S THE ONE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT

21:54.417 --> 21:57.041
IF SHE CAN'T RACE
FOR A WHILE.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.417
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT BEER?

21:59.458 --> 22:02.083
HAVE YOU TOLD HER ABOUT
OUR GOOD FRIEND BEER?

22:02.125 --> 22:04.625
(doorbell rings)

22:04.667 --> 22:06.625
HI.

22:06.667 --> 22:09.208
I-I LEFT YOU
A FEW MESSAGES.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.208
AND I W--I WAS JUST

22:11.250 --> 22:13.333
ON MY WAY OUT
FOR THE EVENING.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.417
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY.

22:16.458 --> 22:19.375
SOMETHING MORE HAPPENED,
DIDN'T IT...

22:19.417 --> 22:21.250
THAN WHAT YOU SAID?

22:27.375 --> 22:29.166
(man) ON YOUR MARKS.

22:31.709 --> 22:35.458
GET SET.

22:43.375 --> 22:46.166
HE PUT
HIS HAND OVER MY MOUTH...

22:46.208 --> 22:50.208
AND PUSHED AGAINST ME
UNTIL I FELT HIS GUN.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.667
HE--HE HAD A GUN?

22:51.709 --> 22:55.417
I TOLD HIM JUST TO TAKE
WHAT HE WANTED AND TO LEAVE,

22:55.458 --> 22:58.333
BUT HE SHOVED ME DOWN
ON THE COUCH.

22:58.375 --> 23:02.333
PLEASE LEAVE.
PLEASE LEAVE.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.583
WHAT DID HE DO, BETH?

23:04.625 --> 23:09.375
SHE... SHE HASN'T HAD
ANY TROUBLE BREATHING?

23:09.417 --> 23:12.166
NO. LOOK AT HER GO.

23:12.208 --> 23:15.375
YOU'RE A MIRACLE WORKER,
PETE.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.583
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.667
I CALLED FOR JOHN.
I KEPT CALLING,

23:19.709 --> 23:22.583
AND THEN I REMEMBERED
HE WASN'T HOME.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.250
I WAS ALL ALONE.

23:24.291 --> 23:26.458
IT'S NOT HAPPENING NOW.
YOU'RE SAFE.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.208
I KICKED HIM, HARD.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.458
HE FELL OFF ME.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.291
YOU DID?

23:33.333 --> 23:34.709
I GOT UP...

23:34.750 --> 23:40.250
AND HE GRABBED MY HAIR,
AND I FELL INTO THE TABLE.

23:40.291 --> 23:42.208
MY SON...

23:42.250 --> 23:45.667
I HEARD HIM WAKE UP
UPSTAIRS CRYING...

23:45.709 --> 23:48.458
BETH.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.250
THAT MAN HIT YOU?

23:58.750 --> 24:00.542
HE TOUCHED YOU?

24:04.500 --> 24:06.333
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BETTER.

24:06.375 --> 24:09.250
SHE'S ABOUT TO BREAK
HER RECORD.
YOU SHOULD TELL HER
TO STOP.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.792
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THE RECORD--
SHE SHOULD STOP.

24:11.834 --> 24:14.458
NICOLE!

24:24.083 --> 24:27.041
HE'S BARELY SAID A WORD SINCE
HE FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

24:27.083 --> 24:28.750
I THOUGHT MAYBE...

24:28.792 --> 24:32.000
BECAUSE HE TRUSTS YOU, HE...

24:34.834 --> 24:37.041
IT WAS RIGHT
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

24:37.083 --> 24:39.875
IT'S JUST HOW HE IS.

24:39.917 --> 24:41.959
HE TAKES EVERYTHING
ON HIMSELF.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.834
THAT MAN HAD HIS HANDS
ALL OVER...

24:44.875 --> 24:47.834
HE TOUCHED HER.
I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

24:47.875 --> 24:50.709
THE THING YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON
IS YOUR WIFE.

24:50.750 --> 24:52.041
I'M GONNA GIVE NOTICE.

24:52.083 --> 24:54.041
NO MORE BUSINESS TRIPS,
NO MORE LEAVING.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.041
WE'RE GONNA GET A GUN--
NO.

24:56.083 --> 24:58.917
HOW ARE YOU EVER GONNA
REST EASY IN OUR HOME, HMM?

24:58.959 --> 25:01.750
HOW ARE YOU EVER
GONNA FEEL SAFE?
LISTEN TO ME.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.750
OKAY, THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I CAN TAKE

25:04.792 --> 25:07.834
SO I WON'T REMEMBER THIS,
A DRUG.

25:07.875 --> 25:09.834
WE DO NOT NEED A GUN.

25:09.875 --> 25:13.041
LET'S--LET'S GO SLOW
BEFORE WE GO TO MEDICATION.

25:13.083 --> 25:16.041
PLEASE. NOTHING HAS CHANGED.
I DON'T WANT TO FEEL IT.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.875
I WANT THE DRUG.

25:26.041 --> 25:28.041
(Pete) WHERE'S HER FAMILY?

25:28.083 --> 25:29.792
OUT OF THE PICTURE.

25:29.834 --> 25:33.000
MY WIFE AND I,
WE PRETTY MUCH RAISED HER.

25:34.875 --> 25:36.041
EXCUSE ME.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.917
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

25:40.000 --> 25:43.959
WHAT KIND OF SNAKE OIL
DID YOU GIVE THAT GIRL?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.792
WE FOUND IT IN HER BAG.
SHE'S ALKALOID TOXIC.

25:47.834 --> 25:50.041
THIS ISN'T MINE.

25:50.083 --> 25:52.041
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
WHAT THIS IS.

25:52.083 --> 25:55.041
WELL, THAT'S A DAMN SHAME,
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR PATIENT,

25:55.083 --> 25:57.834
AND IT MAY BE
WHAT'S ABOUT TO KILL HER.

26:02.083 --> 26:03.917
(knock on door)

26:03.959 --> 26:07.750
COME ON, VYE, OPEN UP.
IT'LL BE OKAY.

26:11.959 --> 26:15.041
COME ON. I GOT THE POST-ALLAN
EMERGENCY KIT--ROSCOE'S

26:15.083 --> 26:18.041
AND EVERY ASHLEY-JUDD-SHOOTS-
HER-CHEATING-HUSBAND MOVIE

26:18.083 --> 26:19.792
I COULD FIND.

26:19.834 --> 26:21.875
OH.

26:21.917 --> 26:24.041
OH, YOU LOOK, UH, GOOD.
WELL, I SHOULDN'T.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.041
I HAD THIS INCREDIBLY
INTENSE THING

26:26.083 --> 26:28.041
WITH THIS, UH,
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS VICTIM.

26:28.083 --> 26:30.000
IT WAS--
WHO'S THERE, VYE?

26:31.125 --> 26:34.917
I GOT IT.

26:36.083 --> 26:38.041
WE'RE JUST TALKING. OKAY?

26:38.083 --> 26:41.875
WORK WENT LATE,
AND SO HE CAME HERE.

26:41.917 --> 26:44.041
SAVE THESE FOR LATER.
YOU WILL NEED THEM.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.875
COOPER--

26:45.917 --> 26:47.917
NO, NO, SEE,
THIS IS WHAT I WAS--

26:47.959 --> 26:49.208
NOW IS THE GIDDY UPDRAFT,

26:49.250 --> 26:52.041
WHICH JUST MEANS YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE FARTHER TO FALL.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.041
AND I CAN'T BE THE ONE
ON CLEANUP DETAIL

26:54.083 --> 26:55.875
WHEN THIS GOES BAD.

26:55.917 --> 26:58.041
OH, SO SUDDENLY
YOU'RE A RELATIONSHIP EXPERT?

26:58.083 --> 27:00.041
I'M AN EXPERT
ON THIS RELATIONSHIP

27:00.083 --> 27:03.041
BECAUSE IT'S ALL
I EVER HEAR ABOUT.

27:03.083 --> 27:05.083
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TIRED.

27:13.083 --> 27:15.000
(groans)

27:15.041 --> 27:18.000
AAH!

27:18.041 --> 27:20.917
AAH!

27:20.959 --> 27:22.125
AAH!

27:22.166 --> 27:24.917
(elevator bell dings)

27:24.959 --> 27:26.917
OH, COME ON.
YOU'RE FANTASIZING
ABOUT ME?

27:26.959 --> 27:28.125
NO.
IT'S SWEET.

27:28.166 --> 27:31.041
IT'S NOT SWEET.
IT'S... GO AWAY.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.041
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID
IN YOUR DREAM?

27:33.083 --> 27:35.041
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT THIS.

27:35.083 --> 27:37.125
YOU LIKE ME.
WH--

27:37.166 --> 27:40.000
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
TORTURE ME LIKE THIS?

27:40.041 --> 27:42.000
DO YOU THINK THIS IS FUN?
KINDA.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.125
(Dell whispers) OKAY.

27:49.166 --> 27:51.083
(Naomi) HELLO.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.000
OH, NO.

27:53.041 --> 27:54.166
NO, SIR.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.834
I AM NOT HAVING A CHILD
POKE AROUND IN LADY TOWN.

27:57.875 --> 28:00.000
I'M NOT A CHILD. I'M--

28:00.041 --> 28:03.041
MY FACIAL HAIR IS OLDER
THAN YOU. I'LL TAKE YOU.

28:03.083 --> 28:05.166
MRS. KOSTER, I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT DELL--
YOUR LOSS.

28:05.208 --> 28:07.875
I DON'T THINK SO.

28:07.917 --> 28:11.041
YOU KNOW, BEETHOVEN COMPOSED HIS
FIRST SYMPHONY WHEN HE WAS 5, 5.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.208
PICASSO MASTERED
THE HUMAN FORM AT 7.

28:13.250 --> 28:16.041
THIS IS WHAT I WAS BORN TO DO,
AND FINALLY, I'M DOING IT.

28:16.083 --> 28:17.166
I-I WOULD HAVE ROCKED
THIS PAP SMEAR.

28:17.208 --> 28:19.041
I GUARANTEE
YOU'D NEVER RECEIVE A MORE--

28:19.083 --> 28:21.041
A MORE RESPECTFUL,
COMPLETE EXAMINATION

28:21.083 --> 28:23.041
OF LADY TOWN IN YOUR LIFE.

28:23.083 --> 28:25.083
SO YEAH, YOUR LOSS.

28:32.917 --> 28:34.166
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD. GO. GO.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.917
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

28:40.959 --> 28:44.000
SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.
I TELL HER EVERYTHING.

28:44.041 --> 28:47.250
HOW CAN I NOT...
TELL HER ABOUT THIS?

28:47.291 --> 28:49.041
(sighs)

28:49.083 --> 28:50.250
SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE TO DISENGAGE.

28:50.291 --> 28:52.250
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
TELL YOURSELF

28:52.291 --> 28:55.166
IT'S BETTER...
NOT TO GET INVOLVED.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.041
(sighs)

28:58.083 --> 29:00.166
I'M DISENGAGING.

29:00.208 --> 29:02.250
VIOLET CAN DO
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

29:02.291 --> 29:05.166
I'M NOT GETTING INVOLVED,
NOT ANYMORE.

29:05.208 --> 29:08.166
SHE CAN JUST... SUFFER.

29:08.208 --> 29:11.041
UM... (laughs)

29:11.083 --> 29:13.041
(laughs)
BUT WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT YOU.

29:13.083 --> 29:14.208
WE WERE.
YEAH. (laughs)

29:14.250 --> 29:16.041
(cell phone rings)

29:16.083 --> 29:17.125
OH.

29:17.166 --> 29:18.959
HELLO.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.083
MAYA, CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT THERE.

29:22.125 --> 29:25.959
BYE. UH, IF NAOMI ASKS
WHERE I AM...

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
DISENGAGED.

29:30.083 --> 29:32.041
(Addison) MAYA!

29:32.083 --> 29:35.041
WHAT'S WRONG?

29:35.083 --> 29:37.250
YOU SAID SOMETHING
WAS WRONG WITH YOU.

29:37.291 --> 29:40.291
NOT ME.

29:40.333 --> 29:43.041
RUBY.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.333
SHE'S...

29:44.375 --> 29:47.041
(whimpering)
WE THOUGHT
SHE JUST HAD--HAD GONORRHEA.

29:47.083 --> 29:49.333
WH-WHAT?
YOU SAID THAT YOU...

29:49.375 --> 29:53.041
I THOUGHT YOU HAD IT.
WE LIED. IT WAS HER.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.041
WE THOUGHT
SHE JUST HAD GONORRHEA.

29:55.083 --> 29:58.333
BUT... NOW WE THINK
SHE'S PREGNANT.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.250
ADDISON,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

30:06.291 --> 30:09.291
RUBY HAS A LATE STAGE
ECTOPIC PREGNANCY.

30:09.333 --> 30:12.041
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.
SHE'S BLEEDING INTO HER BELLY.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.041
I'VE CONTACTED HER PARENTS,
THOUGH.

30:14.083 --> 30:17.166
OH, BUT--BUT WHAT DO I DO?
SHE'S LOST
A LOT OF BLOOD, MAYA.

30:17.208 --> 30:19.166
I'VE GOT TO GET HER
INTO SURGERY.
BUT--

30:19.208 --> 30:21.333
NOW.
BUT WHAT DO I DO?

30:30.041 --> 30:31.291
MOMMY?

30:31.333 --> 30:34.166
(Violet) IT'S TYPICAL
FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

30:34.208 --> 30:37.041
TO HIDE DETAILS
TO PROTECT THEIR PARTNERS.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.000
(Sam) JOHN,
RIGHT AFTER THE ATTACK,

30:39.041 --> 30:41.000
BETH STARTED WORRYING
ABOUT YOU.

30:41.041 --> 30:43.000
I'M NOT THE ONE
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.041
BETH'S THE ONE THAT--

30:45.083 --> 30:49.041
WHAT HAPPENED TO BETH...
WAS AWFUL.

30:49.083 --> 30:52.125
BUT WHAT SHE DID...
BETH.

30:52.166 --> 30:55.041
WHAT YOU DID...

30:55.083 --> 30:57.125
WAS INCREDIBLY BRAVE.
