 you had here was no big deal.

    of hanging around           
    with her society friends.   

05:59.308 --> 06:01.559
            She thinks          
            we're nincompoops.  

06:01.593 --> 06:03.661
Nincompoops?                    

06:03.695 --> 06:04.662
Let's go, Sam.                  

06:04.696 --> 06:06.013
                We're going     
                to talk to her. 

06:06.047 --> 06:06.881
What?                           

06:06.915 --> 06:10.034
        Nobody calls Woody Boyd 
        a nincompoop.           

06:10.069 --> 06:12.470
         Except my dad.         

06:12.504 --> 06:14.155
( <i>knocking</i> )                    

06:16.976 --> 06:17.708
Miss Howe,                      

06:17.743 --> 06:19.410
     with all due respect,      

06:19.444 --> 06:22.413
     that nincompoop crack      
          really hurt.          

06:22.447 --> 06:26.133
    Woody, I didn't call you    
         a nincompoop.          

06:26.167 --> 06:29.353
        All right, then why     
        you won't let us tend   
        bar at your party?      

06:29.387 --> 06:30.288
        Is it because you think 
        we're incompetent?      

06:30.322 --> 06:32.040
            You think we're     
            not smooth enough?  

06:32.158 --> 06:34.792
        You think we're uncouth?

06:34.826 --> 06:36.611
      No, I need you here.      

06:36.645 --> 06:38.212
                    Oh, okay.   

06:38.247 --> 06:40.748
                Let's go, Sam.  

06:40.782 --> 06:41.749
            Whoa, whoa, whoa.   

06:41.783 --> 06:43.917
            What are you doing? 
            Where are you going?

06:43.952 --> 06:44.619
        Sam, now, look.         

06:44.653 --> 06:45.736
    Really, why do you care?    

06:45.771 --> 06:47.622
    Why on Earth do you want    
      to work this party?       

06:47.656 --> 06:49.440
            All right, you know,
            by not hiring us,   

06:49.474 --> 06:51.176
        what you're doing is    
        you're telling the rest 
        of the world            

06:51.210 --> 06:54.712
that Sam Malone is not fit      
for the society of decent folks,

06:54.746 --> 06:57.115
     that he's incompetent,     
    that he's a clod.           

06:57.149 --> 06:58.149
What about me, Sam?             

06:58.184 --> 06:59.617
                You, too, Woody.

06:59.651 --> 07:01.034
I'm going to tell you           

07:01.069 --> 07:01.852
                something, lady.

07:01.887 --> 07:03.237
            We may not have come
            out of Harvard.     

07:03.271 --> 07:04.639
            We may not belong   
            to a yacht club.    

07:04.673 --> 07:07.341
    We may not have tended      
    bar at a polo tournament,   

07:07.375 --> 07:08.977
                but we know how 
                to do our job   

07:09.011 --> 07:12.981
            and we do it with   
            dignity and class.  

07:13.015 --> 07:15.950
         You're right.          

07:15.984 --> 07:17.952
  I'm sorry. The job is yours.  

07:17.986 --> 07:19.870
                    All right!  
                    Whoa, baby! 

07:19.905 --> 07:21.089
             Whoo!              

07:21.123 --> 07:24.459
Whoo! Whoo, baby!               

07:36.271 --> 07:38.089
     Lovely party, Rebecca.     

07:38.123 --> 07:39.707
  Why, thank you, Mr. Collier.  

07:43.228 --> 07:45.530
                Isn't this place
                something, Sam? 

07:45.564 --> 07:46.598
Ooh, yeah.                      

07:46.632 --> 07:48.232
        I think it's even nicer 

07:48.266 --> 07:51.169
        than Wheeler's Funeral  
        Parlor in Hanover.      

07:51.203 --> 07:54.271
            Of course, that's   
            not the most fun    
            place in town.      

07:54.306 --> 07:55.472
Well, I'll bet not.             

07:55.507 --> 07:57.675
        That would be           
        Bob's Funeral Parlor.   

07:59.544 --> 08:00.578
Oh, my God.                     

08:00.612 --> 08:03.998
Woody, is it me                 
or is that woman gorgeous?      

08:04.032 --> 08:05.566
            You look nice, Sam, 

08:05.601 --> 08:09.003
                but I'm going   
                to have to go   
                with the woman. 

08:09.037 --> 08:10.838
Do me a favor here,             
will ya, buddy?                 

08:10.872 --> 08:12.806
        Hold down the fort here 

08:12.841 --> 08:14.975
        while I pass that lady  
        a tray of smoked Sammy. 

08:19.547 --> 08:21.115
Great party, huh?               

08:21.149 --> 08:22.450
                        Yes.    

08:22.484 --> 08:26.220
                    I'll have   
                    a Manhattan.

08:26.254 --> 08:27.488
        What?                   

08:27.522 --> 08:29.323
        Oh, this.               

08:29.358 --> 08:31.692
Well, you think                 
I'm a bartender, huh?           

08:31.726 --> 08:34.878
What do you think you are?      

08:34.913 --> 08:35.996
Well, to tell you               
the truth,                      

08:36.030 --> 08:37.048
I used to be a bartender,       

08:37.082 --> 08:39.265
but now I'm an                  
eccentric millionaire.          

08:39.301 --> 08:42.003
        I just dress like this  
        to remind myself        

08:42.037 --> 08:44.205
        of my modest beginnings.

08:44.239 --> 08:46.340
Back behind the bar.            

08:46.375 --> 08:50.144
        I pay her to say that.  
        It keeps me humble.     

08:50.178 --> 08:51.762
          Malone, now!          

08:51.797 --> 08:55.532
                Ooh, that was   
                a good one, huh?

08:55.567 --> 08:58.936
I'm going to have               
to give her a raise, huh?       

08:58.971 --> 09:01.806
         Looking good.          

09:01.840 --> 09:03.407
Woody, what are you doing?!     

09:03.441 --> 09:05.026
        That is not a trash can.

09:05.060 --> 09:06.593
        That is a work of art.  

09:10.933 --> 09:13.568
                    Oh, my God. 

09:13.602 --> 09:15.937
    This is just what I need    
    is for Collier to see this. 

09:15.971 --> 09:17.237
            He is a collector.  

09:17.272 --> 09:18.739
Oh, hey, let's                  
calm down now.                  

09:18.773 --> 09:20.374
  Nobody's seen anything yet.   

09:20.409 --> 09:23.110
 Woody, take it in the kitchen  
    and clean it out.           

09:23.144 --> 09:24.245
Sure, Sam.                      
Sorry, Miss Howe.               

09:24.279 --> 09:25.246
                    Woody, go.  
                    Just go.    

09:25.280 --> 09:27.215
        I got you. I got you.   

09:27.249 --> 09:28.382
                I tell you, Sam.

09:28.417 --> 09:29.517
     This is the last time      

09:29.551 --> 09:30.785
    I'm going to throw          
  one of these fancy parties.   

09:30.819 --> 09:32.754
    The next time one           
    of these hotshots wants...  

09:32.788 --> 09:34.655
    ( <i>glass breaking</i> )          

09:39.428 --> 09:40.494
     Don't worry, Ms. Howe.     

09:40.529 --> 09:41.995
 It was only a tray of glasses. 

09:44.649 --> 09:46.833
        Thank God.              
  Let's not tempt fate, Woody.  

09:46.868 --> 09:48.152
     I'll clean it myself.      

09:50.439 --> 09:52.739
They weren't great glasses,     
Sam, and they were dirty.       

09:52.774 --> 09:55.025
    ( <i>glass breaking</i> )          

09:59.664 --> 10:02.483
            Just a guess here:  
            uh, the vase?       

10:08.706 --> 10:10.908
         It was there.          
    I was holding it.           

10:10.942 --> 10:14.211
It was right in my hands,       
    and now it's gone.          

10:14.246 --> 10:15.780
Maybe we can glue it            
back together                   

10:15.814 --> 10:17.081
and no one will ever know.      

10:18.233 --> 10:19.499
          Forget that.          

10:19.534 --> 10:21.135
              Oh!               

10:21.170 --> 10:22.437
            Just calm down now. 

10:22.471 --> 10:24.038
Calm down.                      
It was an accident.             

10:24.040 --> 10:25.673
I'm sure Mr. Collier            
will understand.                

10:25.707 --> 10:26.774
                No, he won't.   

10:26.808 --> 10:27.875
                This isn't the  
                first time      

10:27.909 --> 10:29.310
                I've goofed up  
                at the company. 

10:29.344 --> 10:30.945
         I started out          
     as a junior executive      

10:30.979 --> 10:33.514
  and I'm diligently working    
  my way down to the mailroom   

10:33.548 --> 10:38.552
     with a brief stopover      
 at that Siberia called Cheers. 

10:38.586 --> 10:42.507
Shh-shh. Stop it.               
Just calm down here.            
Calm down.                      

10:42.541 --> 10:45.142
        I know.                 
        I'll just resign now,   

10:45.176 --> 10:46.744
        move back to San Diego, 

10:46.778 --> 10:49.179
            join the Navy,      
            grow old and die.   

10:49.214 --> 10:50.148
Oh...                           

10:51.850 --> 10:55.853
                Boy, Sam,       
                I really feel   
                sorry for her.  

10:55.887 --> 10:58.922
Never thought I'd say it,       
but so do I.                    

10:58.957 --> 11:01.859
Look at this party              
she threw together here,        

11:01.893 --> 11:04.962
and then that happens.          
Poor kid.                       

11:06.764 --> 11:08.298
            You think they'll   
            make me manager?    

11:08.333 --> 11:09.767
Hey, yo, over here.             

11:15.240 --> 11:17.941
You know, Woody,                

11:17.976 --> 11:20.578
I'm about to do                 
a decent thing here.            

11:20.612 --> 11:21.562
                        Get out.

11:21.596 --> 11:23.263
Yeah.                           

11:23.298 --> 11:24.715
    I'm going to take           
    the fall for this.          

11:24.750 --> 11:27.317
         What the hell?         
     I'm a great bartender.     

11:27.352 --> 11:29.587
I can get a job anywhere I want.

11:29.621 --> 11:32.239
            Sam, that's the     
            second nicest thing 
            you've ever done.   

11:32.273 --> 11:33.307
Well, thank you.                

11:33.341 --> 11:35.459
    What's the nicest?          

11:35.493 --> 11:38.078
            When you let me     
            drive your Corvette.

11:38.112 --> 11:38.946
      Right. Right, right.      

11:39.064 --> 11:40.698
That's good. That's good.       

11:44.386 --> 11:46.987
        Excuse me, young man.   

11:47.022 --> 11:48.906
What happened to the vase       
    that was sitting there?     

11:48.940 --> 11:50.040
    Somebody move it?           

11:54.162 --> 11:56.430
Sir, I have a confession.       

11:56.465 --> 11:57.598
     My name is Woody Boyd,     

11:57.632 --> 11:59.633
        and by accident,        
    I broke your vase.          

11:59.667 --> 12:01.586
             You...             

12:01.620 --> 12:03.387
         you broke it?!         

12:03.421 --> 12:04.304
                        You...  

12:05.774 --> 12:08.208
Do you know how many years      
            I waited            

12:08.242 --> 12:09.743
 to add that to my collection?  

12:10.662 --> 12:13.480
         Do you realize         
the significance of that piece? 

12:13.514 --> 12:15.132
            No, sir.            

12:15.166 --> 12:17.601
 And I also broke some glasses. 

12:21.540 --> 12:23.324
No, Sam,                        
I can't let you do it.          

12:23.358 --> 12:24.675
It wouldn't be right if you...  

12:25.894 --> 12:30.097
 Uh, Mr. Collier, there's been  
      a terrible accident.      

12:30.132 --> 12:32.433
 Yes. This person just told me  

12:32.467 --> 12:35.569
                how he destroyed
                my vase.        

12:35.604 --> 12:37.171
    But Woody didn't do it.     

12:37.205 --> 12:39.190
What she means                  
is I didn't do it               
on purpose.                     

12:39.224 --> 12:40.707
                    Yes, I know.

12:40.742 --> 12:43.327
 The only thing that can match  
    my great disappointment     

12:43.362 --> 12:46.897
    at losing the vase          
    is the admiration           

12:46.931 --> 12:49.083
    that I feel for this boy.   

12:52.437 --> 12:55.272
            Woody, you showed   
            great courage       
            and integrity       

12:55.306 --> 12:57.541
        in stepping up          
        to face the music here. 

12:57.576 --> 13:00.043
        Rebecca, would you mind 
        standing in for Woody   

13:00.078 --> 13:01.078
            for a little while? 

13:01.112 --> 13:02.212
            You wouldn't mind,  
            would you?          

13:02.246 --> 13:03.781
            I'd like to get     
            to know him better. 

13:07.903 --> 13:10.387
            You want a drink?   

13:10.422 --> 13:12.256
Well, sure.                     

13:12.291 --> 13:13.958
                 Well, just tell
                 the girl.      

13:16.245 --> 13:19.679
Miss Howe, I'll have a...       
         gin and tonic.         

13:19.714 --> 13:20.998
         Well, come on.         
      She'll bring 'em in.      

13:21.032 --> 13:22.866
                          WOODY:
                          Oh.   

13:35.146 --> 13:37.364
    Another Manhattan.          

13:37.399 --> 13:39.283
        Manhattan, huh?         

13:39.318 --> 13:42.119
 I own a lot of that, you know? 

13:42.154 --> 13:44.522
Right, the eccentric millionaire
            routine.            

13:44.556 --> 13:46.239
You know, I got                 
to tell you the truth here.     

13:46.274 --> 13:48.676
I'm getting kind of bored       
serving all these stiffs drinks.

13:48.710 --> 13:50.043
What do you say                 
you and I go out                

13:50.078 --> 13:51.311
and spend some                  
of my money?                    

13:51.345 --> 13:53.114
What time does France           
close anyway?                   

13:55.517 --> 13:57.017
                 I think they're
                 remodeling.    

13:57.052 --> 13:58.385
    Oh.                         

13:58.419 --> 13:59.954
                  Have any other
                  suggestions?  

13:59.988 --> 14:02.706
Unfortunately, my mansion's     
being painted                   

14:02.740 --> 14:04.325
and my yacht's                  
in dry dock.                    

14:04.359 --> 14:05.409
Well, let me see...             

14:05.443 --> 14:06.610
Oh, I know it.                  
I know it.                      

14:06.644 --> 14:07.811
You know, my chauffeur's        

14:07.845 --> 14:09.913
got a little one-bedroom        
apartment downtown.             

14:09.947 --> 14:12.749
What do you say you             
and I go slumming?              

14:12.783 --> 14:13.617
                Let me guess:   

14:13.651 --> 14:16.570
        you're not really       
        rich at all, are you?   

14:16.605 --> 14:17.971
Well, now,                      
define "rich."                  

14:18.006 --> 14:19.072
I have my health.               

14:21.543 --> 14:24.911
        I... uh, think I'll just
        stick with the drink.   

14:24.946 --> 14:26.013
Let me get this straight:       

14:26.047 --> 14:27.982
        when you thought        
that I was a millionaire,       

14:28.016 --> 14:29.516
    you were ready to go out    
            with me,            

14:29.550 --> 14:31.318
     but now that I'm just      
     a healthy bartender,       

14:31.353 --> 14:33.354
    you don't want to have      
    anything to do with me.     

14:33.388 --> 14:34.304
I gotta tell you, lady,         

14:34.339 --> 14:36.123
that makes you                  
an incredibly shallow person.   

14:36.158 --> 14:37.891
        Do you actually think   
        this sort of approach   

14:37.926 --> 14:38.993
            is going to work?   

14:39.027 --> 14:40.294
Absolutely.                     

14:40.329 --> 14:42.663
You see, I'm an incredibly      
     shallow person myself.     

14:42.698 --> 14:44.698
Between the two of us,          

14:44.732 --> 14:47.468
        we couldn't make        
        a decent wading pool.   

14:47.502 --> 14:49.102
        What do you say, huh?   

14:49.137 --> 14:51.438
Don't I know you from somewhere?

14:51.473 --> 14:52.573
                    Yeah, well, 
                    you probably

14:52.607 --> 14:54.575
                 caught me out  
                 at Fenway, huh?

14:54.609 --> 14:55.509
    Of course.                  

14:55.543 --> 14:58.212
I bought a bag                  
of peanuts from you.            

15:03.985 --> 15:07.120
Another round of brandies       
    for Butch and Sundance.     

15:09.057 --> 15:11.058
They're really, uh,             
hitting it off, huh?            

15:11.092 --> 15:12.359
                I should say so.

15:12.394 --> 15:15.229
        They're in there        
        singing school songs.   

15:15.263 --> 15:16.847
             If you hate Ivy    
             League fight songs,

15:16.881 --> 15:20.918
         wait till you hear one 
         from bartending school.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.703
     You're not taking this     
      very well, are you?       

15:22.738 --> 15:24.338
            What, that little   
            backstabber?        

15:24.372 --> 15:25.972
Oh, now cut that out.           

15:26.007 --> 15:28.308
Woody took a big risk, you know.

15:28.343 --> 15:30.711
You broke the vase and          
he took the blame for it.       

15:30.745 --> 15:32.579
It didn't have                  
to turn out that way.           

15:32.613 --> 15:34.481
     He just had your best      
    interest at heart.          

15:34.516 --> 15:35.882
                I know.         

15:35.917 --> 15:38.352
    I could just hug him till   
    his tongue turns black.     

15:44.926 --> 15:48.062
     You know, I'm not convinced
     you're a millionaire,      

15:48.096 --> 15:52.499
          but I am sold         
          on the eccentric part.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.168
Well, that's a start.           

15:54.202 --> 15:55.702
                 And since      
                 I'm not getting

15:55.736 --> 15:57.371
         any interesting        
         nibbles tonight anyway,

15:57.405 --> 15:59.806
            I'm reconsidering   
            your offer.         

15:59.841 --> 16:03.127
Nibbles are my specialty.       

16:03.161 --> 16:04.412
                Great.          

16:04.446 --> 16:06.713
            Well, what time will
            you be getting off? 

16:14.155 --> 16:15.339

to show you a trick shot.       

16:17.576 --> 16:18.876
      Now you watch this.       

16:18.910 --> 16:20.978
Got you again, Pinky!

                    Oh, uh...   

16:25.850 --> 16:28.168
      You seem to have something
      in your eye, Woodhead.    

16:28.203 --> 16:29.703
            I'll get it for you.

16:29.737 --> 16:31.872
Oh, Pinky, stop!                

16:31.907 --> 16:34.641
It's noogie time!               

16:34.675 --> 16:36.193
                 Oh, no! No! No!

16:36.227 --> 16:38.261
        No, Woody!              

16:38.296 --> 16:39.863
                    No! No more!

16:47.305 --> 16:48.805
I mean, hello,                  
Miss Howe.

                  Oh, Woody.    

16:51.476 --> 16:54.244
          I tell you, you have  
          no idea how hard it is

16:54.278 --> 16:56.046
            to find young fellas

16:56.080 --> 16:58.582
            with your stuff     
            in this day and age.

16:58.616 --> 17:00.618
        You ought to see        
    the buttoned-down brats     

17:00.652 --> 17:02.820
        my granddaughter        
    drags home from college.    

17:02.854 --> 17:05.105
                She really      
                deserves someone

17:05.140 --> 17:06.473
more solid, someone real.       

17:09.344 --> 17:12.229
                Someone with    
                a strong back   

17:12.262 --> 17:14.097
            and a thick neck,   
            you know?           

17:14.131 --> 17:15.882
    Someone like you, Woody.    

17:15.915 --> 17:17.785
  Thank you, sir. I couldn't.   

17:17.819 --> 17:19.869
Yeah, I could.                  

17:23.208 --> 17:26.675
        She's out in Vail right 
        now on a skiing holiday.

17:26.711 --> 17:30.047
                 I'm going up   
                 there tomorrow.

17:30.081 --> 17:32.633
                Woody, why don't
                you join me?    

17:33.268 --> 17:34.184
     You mean that, Pinky?      

17:34.219 --> 17:35.652
                You bet I do.   

17:35.687 --> 17:38.488
Well, I don't know if Miss Howe 
     would be too happy...      

17:38.523 --> 17:39.874
         Oh, she'll be thrilled.

17:39.908 --> 17:41.876
          To my toes.

17:43.111 --> 17:44.744
                 So, great, I'll
                 go tell Jamison

17:44.779 --> 17:46.213
to arrange it                   
right now.                      

17:46.247 --> 17:47.815
                    Ah!         

17:47.849 --> 17:52.185
Woody, where do you             
get these things?!              

17:54.055 --> 17:55.623
     Go figure, Miss Howe.      

17:55.657 --> 17:57.525
  I mean, you break the vase,   

17:57.559 --> 18:00.895
    and I end up being          
      the big boss' buddy.      

18:02.430 --> 18:03.797
    Isn't life funny?           

18:03.832 --> 18:05.499
Do you mean funny "ha-ha"       

18:05.533 --> 18:08.068
 or funny "a living nightmare"? 

18:09.988 --> 18:11.322
 Is something wrong, Miss Howe? 

18:11.356 --> 18:14.040
    Yes, something is wrong.    

18:14.075 --> 18:15.793
         I am the one who should
         be playing pool.       

18:15.827 --> 18:18.194
          I'm the one who should
          be smoking cigars     
          and drinking brandy.

18:24.602 --> 18:25.819
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Howe.     

18:25.853 --> 18:27.721
I was only trying to help.      

18:27.755 --> 18:28.955
  Okay, Woody, we're all set.   

18:28.989 --> 18:31.891
I'll stop by the bar tomorrow   
afternoon and pick you up.      

18:33.211 --> 18:34.945
Pinky, I have a confession.     

18:36.097 --> 18:39.216
I didn't break your vase.       
Miss Howe did.                  

18:41.001 --> 18:43.403
     Whew, glad I got that      
         off my chest.          

18:45.406 --> 18:47.191
    You broke my vase?          

18:47.225 --> 18:50.811
            Well, actually, yes.

18:50.845 --> 18:53.413
 That's the most cowardly thing 
    I have ever heard.          

18:55.116 --> 18:57.217
 You'd let this fine young man  
         take the blame         

18:57.252 --> 18:58.769
      for your clumsiness?

Miss Howe.                      

19:00.872 --> 19:02.405
I'm going to have               
to seriously reconsider

      is a very nice lady.

Well... well, all right.        

19:16.220 --> 19:19.322
Woody, if you'll vouch          
for her, I'll give her          

19:19.357 --> 19:21.825
another chance,                 
I guess.
