20:31.330 --> 20:31.897
Hey.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.632
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything,

20:33.632 --> 20:37.869
but I could use
a little help stretching.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.610
We are back!

20:45.711 --> 20:47.679
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

20:49.848 --> 20:51.583
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

20:51.583 --> 20:53.585
[GROANS]

20:54.119 --> 20:56.922
Well,
that was the last room.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.392
Now the apartment's
officially ours.

21:04.863 --> 21:05.864
Wait a minute.

21:05.864 --> 21:09.167
That was my drawer.
Did you take one of my drawers?

21:09.167 --> 21:10.669
Yeah.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.639
When?

21:14.340 --> 21:16.742
When I was on top.

21:17.676 --> 21:21.246
So is this how it's gonna be
for the rest of my life?

21:21.246 --> 21:23.214
Uh-huh.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.717
Do you want another drawer?

21:25.717 --> 21:26.685
Yeah.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.019
[LAUGHS]

21:28.019 --> 21:31.022
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

21:34.593 --> 21:39.064
