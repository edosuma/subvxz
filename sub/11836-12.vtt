WEBVTT

00:01.434 --> 00:02.602
DOLE: Previously
on The Practice.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.304
JOSHUA: He began to have
a problem in high school

00:04.337 --> 00:05.205
in his senior year.

00:05.238 --> 00:06.239
A drinking problem?

00:06.272 --> 00:08.141
JOSHUA: Yes,
then in college, uh,

00:08.173 --> 00:09.543
he got into the frat scene.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.177
He died
of alcohol poisoning.

00:11.211 --> 00:13.580
And you're blaming
Portiss Brewery.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.048
JOSHUA: I'm certainly aware
that there were other beers,

00:15.081 --> 00:16.216
but for the most part,

00:16.248 --> 00:17.718
it was Portiss.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.986
Do you take any responsibility,
Mr. Berry?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.055
Your son was underage,

00:22.088 --> 00:23.489
drinking illegally.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.025
No matter what parents say,

00:25.058 --> 00:26.326
it is hard to compete

00:26.359 --> 00:28.762
with the images of fun
and social acceptance

00:28.795 --> 00:31.097
that is being marketed
by the alcohol industry.

00:31.131 --> 00:34.601
We make it our business
to curtail underage drinkers.

00:34.635 --> 00:35.636
Really?

00:35.669 --> 00:37.638
Besides those sex
and alcohol commercials,

00:37.671 --> 00:38.371
what else?

00:38.404 --> 00:39.205
Objection!

00:39.239 --> 00:41.041
This kid couldn't so much

00:41.074 --> 00:42.676
as watch a baseball game

00:42.709 --> 00:44.678
without hearing your jingle,
Mr. Carroll,

00:44.711 --> 00:46.479
and he's dead, he's dead!

00:46.513 --> 00:48.515
GRUNDEL: Your Honor, could
I have a two-minute recess?

00:48.549 --> 00:49.550
We have an offer
we'd like to propose

00:49.583 --> 00:50.316
to the plaintiff.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.252
1.6 million.

00:52.285 --> 00:53.887
Should we take it?

00:53.920 --> 00:55.522
Let's take our chances.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.523
What?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.258
The offer is rejected,
Your Honor.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.466
Mr. Foreman, what say you?

01:00.501 --> 01:03.169
We, the jury,
find in favor of the plaintiff,

01:03.203 --> 01:05.405
and order the defendant
to pay punitive damages

01:05.438 --> 01:08.908
in the amount of $125 million.

01:08.942 --> 01:09.676
We appeal!

01:10.844 --> 01:12.879
One of my inmates
is Denise Freeman.

01:12.913 --> 01:15.816
She shot two young boys
playing in the park.

01:15.849 --> 01:18.118
She's scheduled
to be executed next week.

01:18.151 --> 01:19.285
How can I help?

01:19.319 --> 01:20.587
I'd like you
to stop it.

01:20.621 --> 01:22.022
Are you against
the death penalty?

01:22.055 --> 01:22.889
MARSHALL: No, not at all.

01:22.923 --> 01:24.090
In fact, I think we should

01:24.124 --> 01:25.491
employ it more often.

01:25.526 --> 01:27.828
But we shouldn't be killing
Denise Freeman.

01:27.861 --> 01:30.664
She's not the same person
who committed those crimes.

01:30.697 --> 01:31.898
FREEMAN: I heard voices,

01:31.932 --> 01:33.900
I thought they were
a mandate from God.

01:33.934 --> 01:35.101
You know,
there's somebody like me

01:35.135 --> 01:36.803
on "Dateline" once a week.

01:36.837 --> 01:38.438
And the actual diagnosis?

01:38.471 --> 01:40.140
Paranoid schizophrenia.

01:40.173 --> 01:41.975
Do you have a memory
of the killings?

01:42.008 --> 01:45.812
They haven't found the
medication yet to erase memory.

01:45.846 --> 01:47.180
You wanna take her
off the meds?

01:47.213 --> 01:49.349
FRUTT: And stop the execution
on the grounds

01:49.382 --> 01:50.651
that she's insane.

01:50.684 --> 01:52.819
The Supreme Court
has expressly held

01:52.853 --> 01:55.421
Eighth Amendment
prohibits executing the insane.

01:55.455 --> 01:57.290
Go off my medication?!

01:57.323 --> 01:59.626
It's our last best shot.

01:59.660 --> 02:02.468
I will go crazy, Ellenor.

02:02.503 --> 02:03.937
You do realize that.

02:08.809 --> 02:10.943
FREEMAN: Uh, it's, uh, just--

02:10.977 --> 02:14.548
it's just that
they would laugh, you know.

02:15.716 --> 02:18.051
Not really laugh,

02:18.084 --> 02:19.052
"ha-ha-ha"

02:19.085 --> 02:21.788
because then they would get
into trouble.

02:23.289 --> 02:26.026
They would get sent
to the principal's office.

02:26.059 --> 02:27.828
And they all knew better.

02:27.861 --> 02:29.462
Denise, who talked?

02:29.495 --> 02:31.632
The kids,

02:31.665 --> 02:33.534
all the kids.

02:33.567 --> 02:34.501
Kids.

02:34.535 --> 02:35.636
The kids you shot?

02:38.672 --> 02:41.241
Denise, the kids you shot?

02:41.274 --> 02:43.209
FREEMAN:
Every time I entered a room,

02:43.243 --> 02:44.545
except they would disguise it

02:44.578 --> 02:46.813
because they knew that
they would get into trouble,

02:46.847 --> 02:48.782
they'd cough.

02:48.815 --> 02:49.916
That was their plan.

02:49.950 --> 02:51.351
And sometimes,
they would sneeze,

02:51.384 --> 02:53.186
but usually they would cough,

02:53.219 --> 02:56.389
and that was to laugh at me.

02:57.090 --> 03:00.200
Denise, which kids?

03:00.233 --> 03:03.403
FREEMAN: All the kids...

03:03.436 --> 03:04.505
at school,

03:04.538 --> 03:05.606
the kids at school.

03:06.272 --> 03:07.908
They'd always cough.

03:07.941 --> 03:10.544
The boys in the park,
did they cough?

03:10.577 --> 03:12.378
I'm not supposed
to talk about that.

03:12.412 --> 03:13.279
That's a secret.

03:14.615 --> 03:15.849
A secret? Between...

03:15.882 --> 03:16.850
Me and him.

03:17.818 --> 03:18.719
Who's "him"?

03:19.219 --> 03:20.721
He doesn't cough.

03:20.754 --> 03:22.255
STUCKY:
You don't know who "him" is,

03:22.288 --> 03:24.858
but you and he entered
into a secret?

03:24.891 --> 03:27.293
He talks to me
from the inside!

03:28.161 --> 03:29.362
The inside of...

03:29.395 --> 03:30.463
Me!

03:32.332 --> 03:35.268
(music playing)

03:39.773 --> 03:42.275
PARKER: We have no way
of knowing this isn't an act.

03:42.308 --> 03:43.577
She certainly has motive.

03:43.610 --> 03:46.246
She was examined
by six different doctors,

03:46.279 --> 03:47.814
including two
from the state.

03:47.848 --> 03:49.449
They all came
to the same conclusion.

03:49.482 --> 03:51.051
PARKER:
If she's legally insane

03:51.084 --> 03:52.619
and I make no such concession,

03:52.653 --> 03:54.988
her state of mind
is self-inflicted here.

03:55.021 --> 03:56.757
How does that--
That's not an issue

03:56.790 --> 03:57.824
before this court.

03:57.858 --> 03:59.159
This is a hearing

03:59.192 --> 04:01.401
to determine
her mental state only.

04:01.434 --> 04:03.136
The consequence
of that determination

04:03.169 --> 04:04.905
is up to another court.

04:04.938 --> 04:07.073
This, to me, is a perversity
of our legal system.

04:07.107 --> 04:09.876
It may very well be,
Mr. Parker.

04:09.910 --> 04:11.578
But this hearing,
like Ms. Frutt says,

04:11.612 --> 04:15.215
is only about the petitioner's
current mental health.

04:15.248 --> 04:16.149
Ms. Freeman,

04:17.651 --> 04:19.285
I have wonderful news.

04:19.319 --> 04:21.154
The court hereby
finds you insane.

04:22.556 --> 04:24.024
You must be pleased.

04:26.226 --> 04:29.229
(music playing)

05:23.456 --> 05:26.627
FREEMAN: So, what now?

05:28.261 --> 05:29.362
The next step

05:29.395 --> 05:31.497
is we go to
the Federal District Court

05:31.532 --> 05:32.999
to stop the execution

05:33.033 --> 05:34.735
on the grounds
that you're insane.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.103
And that's a matter
of course, right?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.972
I mean, it's perfunctory.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.575
The Supreme Court has
already ruled on this, right?

05:41.608 --> 05:44.410
Nothing is perfunctory,

05:44.444 --> 05:47.180
and as the attorney general
said before,

05:47.213 --> 05:50.751
the fact that your insanity
is somewhat self-inflicted--

05:50.784 --> 05:52.285
When can I get back
on my medication?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.489
Well, the state will try
to force you back on.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.593
And under the current law,
they might be able to do that.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.433
For our purposes--

06:00.466 --> 06:02.202
It's too loud.

06:02.235 --> 06:03.269
It's too loud.

06:03.303 --> 06:04.137
(coughs)

06:04.170 --> 06:04.871
Hey!

06:09.810 --> 06:10.544
Denise,

06:11.878 --> 06:14.114
remember,
that's your illness.

06:14.147 --> 06:15.248
When people cough,

06:15.281 --> 06:18.084
they're not really laughing
at you.

06:18.118 --> 06:19.452
That's your illness.

06:19.986 --> 06:21.421
FREEMAN: Then why
is she looking back at me

06:21.454 --> 06:23.123
like she's sorry?

06:23.156 --> 06:24.090
You're sorry, aren't you?

06:24.124 --> 06:24.825
Yes.

06:24.858 --> 06:25.792
See?!
FRUTT: Jamie.

06:25.826 --> 06:27.360
No, I'm not.

06:29.863 --> 06:31.732
To answer your question,

06:31.765 --> 06:33.299
for our purposes,

06:33.333 --> 06:35.168
first,

06:35.201 --> 06:37.337
let's stop the execution,

06:37.370 --> 06:39.239
then,

06:39.272 --> 06:41.341
we'll try to get you back
on your medication.

06:44.978 --> 06:47.814
You need to hurry, Ellenor.

06:47.848 --> 06:50.951
It's getting too loud.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.925
2.5?

06:58.959 --> 07:00.867
And you're advising us
to take it?

07:00.901 --> 07:02.402
I'm advising you to consider it.

07:02.435 --> 07:04.605
JOSHUA: The verdict was a
hundred and twenty-five million.

07:04.638 --> 07:06.306
YOUNG: They have a motion
for remittative schedule

07:06.339 --> 07:07.608
for Wednesday.

07:07.641 --> 07:09.342
The judge will likely
knock it down anyway to--

07:09.375 --> 07:10.777
To 2.5?
YOUNG: I don't know.

07:10.811 --> 07:12.145
He could even throw it out
altogether.

07:12.178 --> 07:13.279
It could happen.

07:13.313 --> 07:14.247
JOSHUA: I don't believe this.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.281
We won.

07:16.750 --> 07:17.818
Joshua,

07:17.851 --> 07:21.888
after more than 300 lawsuits
and many adverse verdicts,

07:21.922 --> 07:24.324
the tobacco companies
have yet to pay out a cent

07:24.357 --> 07:26.192
in individual-smoker cases.

07:26.226 --> 07:27.393
It'll be the same here.

07:27.427 --> 07:30.096
If we're to get anything,
it could be years.

07:30.130 --> 07:31.464
2.5 in the hand
is so much--

07:31.497 --> 07:33.166
No!

07:33.199 --> 07:35.001
Now I am angry.

07:35.035 --> 07:36.336
I stuck it out
through a trial.

07:36.369 --> 07:37.571
I got a verdict.

07:37.604 --> 07:39.139
And now you are
advising me to settle

07:39.172 --> 07:42.509
because the defendant
won't honor that verdict.

07:42.543 --> 07:44.344
It's outrageous.
I don't disagree, but--

07:44.377 --> 07:45.612
JOSHUA:
I don't need the money.

07:45.646 --> 07:48.048
I live a comfortable life.

07:48.081 --> 07:50.350
If I have to wait
another 10 years, I'll do it.

07:50.383 --> 07:51.151
Joshua...

07:51.184 --> 07:52.619
I said no.

07:55.822 --> 07:58.859
If they had offered me
something at the beginning

07:58.892 --> 08:01.301
before the trial--

08:01.334 --> 08:02.603
but they offered nothing.

08:02.636 --> 08:06.640
And now after they lose--

08:06.673 --> 08:07.808
of all the arrogance.

08:09.409 --> 08:12.145
We beat them.

08:12.178 --> 08:13.814
I will not settle for this.

08:13.847 --> 08:16.617
No, I will not.

08:21.421 --> 08:22.956
FRUTT: I direct
the court's attention

08:22.989 --> 08:24.691
to Ford versus Wainwright,

08:24.725 --> 08:26.860
where the Supreme Court held
that the Eighth Amendment

08:26.893 --> 08:30.496
Prohibits the state
from executing an insane inmate.

08:30.531 --> 08:33.232
Denise Freeman has been
adjudicated to be insane,

08:33.265 --> 08:35.135
and, therefore--
First of all, Your Honor,

08:35.168 --> 08:36.436
that ruling is suspect.

08:36.469 --> 08:37.971
Suspect with whom?

08:38.004 --> 08:40.273
How about the chief justice
of the Supreme Court,

08:40.306 --> 08:41.407
who scoffed at the ruling?

08:41.441 --> 08:43.943
It's nevertheless
the majority opinion.

08:43.977 --> 08:46.479
SEYMOUR: The court also held
the defendant waived his right

08:46.513 --> 08:48.649
if he voluntarily
went off medication.

08:48.682 --> 08:50.050
That was for competency.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.718
They never talked
about waiver

08:51.752 --> 08:53.153
when it comes to punishment.

08:53.186 --> 08:55.488
Look, Wainwright makes clear

08:55.956 --> 08:59.826
to kill an insane person
has little retributive value.

08:59.860 --> 09:01.635
It presents no example
to others.

09:01.668 --> 09:05.205
It is not a deterrent
and it offends humanity.

09:05.238 --> 09:06.406
PARKER:
And I would ask the court,

09:06.439 --> 09:08.274
as Justice Rehnquist does,

09:08.308 --> 09:11.077
where does it all stop?

09:11.111 --> 09:13.246
There has to be
some finality to the law.

09:13.279 --> 09:16.416
Miss Freeman was judged sane
at her trial.

09:16.449 --> 09:17.884
She was found guilty.

09:17.918 --> 09:20.587
She basically had another trial
on the issue of punishment.

09:20.621 --> 09:22.288
Now here she comes again,

09:22.322 --> 09:23.957
saying she's insane,
can't kill her.

09:24.490 --> 09:25.959
Suppose she loses this one,

09:25.992 --> 09:28.562
what's to stop her from
coming back tomorrow saying,

09:28.595 --> 09:30.063
"Now I'm really insane?"

09:30.096 --> 09:31.164
or the day after?

09:31.798 --> 09:34.968
We could be conducting
insanity trials in perpetuity.

09:35.001 --> 09:37.403
Every death-row inmate
would be jumping up and down,

09:37.437 --> 09:39.039
screaming,
"Look at me! I'm nuts!"

09:39.072 --> 09:41.808
And here, for a sane inmate

09:41.842 --> 09:43.544
to deliberately
go off her medication,

09:43.577 --> 09:46.446
for the express purpose
of making herself crazy

09:46.479 --> 09:48.782
so she can escape execution,

09:48.815 --> 09:50.050
that's a mockery.

09:50.083 --> 09:53.654
It may be a mockery,
Mr. Parker,

09:53.687 --> 09:55.989
but as I interpret
the Supreme Court,

09:56.022 --> 09:59.159
with all due respect
to Justice Rehnquist,

09:59.192 --> 10:01.167
we cannot execute the insane.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.906
I, therefore,
stay the execution.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.007
PARKER: I petition the court

10:07.040 --> 10:09.475
to allow the state
to medicate Ms. Freeman.

10:09.510 --> 10:12.412
The New Hampshire Supreme Court
has previously held

10:12.445 --> 10:14.515
that a mentally ill defendant
can be medicated

10:14.548 --> 10:15.782
against his or her will
if it's--

10:15.816 --> 10:17.551
FRUTT: Once again,
that was for trial.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.119
It was not for punishment,

10:19.152 --> 10:20.921
certainly not the death penalty.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.256
The same rationale
would support forced medication

10:23.289 --> 10:24.357
for punishment purposes.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.627
Your Honor,
this is a separate issue,

10:26.660 --> 10:28.194
a very complicated one.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.396
I would request
additional time to prepare.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.364
She's stalling.

10:31.397 --> 10:32.966
I am not stalling.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.467
It's called "due process."

10:34.500 --> 10:35.802
SEYMOUR: All right.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.271
We'll reconvene tomorrow
at 9:00 a. m.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.440
on the issue
of forced medication.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.676
Until then, we're adjourned.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.977
(gavel bangs)

10:49.482 --> 10:51.952
Now for the tough part.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.755
They wanna force-medicate you
to make you sane

10:54.788 --> 10:57.123
so they can then carry out
the execution.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.125
As I said before,
under the current law,

10:59.159 --> 11:01.134
they may be able to do this.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.503
It's unclear.

11:02.536 --> 11:04.605
You need to stop it.

11:04.638 --> 11:06.072
I can't.

11:06.106 --> 11:06.907
I can't.

11:07.808 --> 11:09.042
It's getting worse.

11:09.676 --> 11:11.211
Explain to me
what's happening.

11:11.244 --> 11:12.713
I know. I know.

11:12.746 --> 11:14.447
I wrote myself a letter

11:14.480 --> 11:16.917
before I went off
the medication.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.652
I told myself
that what's happening

11:18.685 --> 11:21.755
is not really happening,
so I know. I know.

11:21.788 --> 11:25.258
It's just,
I'm not feeling very well,

11:25.291 --> 11:26.126
and I need--

11:31.898 --> 11:35.135
We can't put you back
on the medication now

11:35.168 --> 11:38.672
because it would mean
sanity and death.

11:40.774 --> 11:43.544
So, I need you
to hang in there

11:43.577 --> 11:45.445
just a little longer.

12:02.268 --> 12:03.604
DONNELL: What do you mean
he won't take it?

12:03.637 --> 12:04.571
YOUNG: He said no.

12:04.605 --> 12:06.172
If it means waiting 10 years
to see a nickel,

12:06.206 --> 12:06.873
then so be it.

12:06.907 --> 12:07.974
The guy's dug in.

12:08.008 --> 12:09.275
He was adamant.

12:09.910 --> 12:11.311
Get him in here.

12:11.344 --> 12:12.145
Why? What do you wanna--

12:12.178 --> 12:13.947
I want to talk to the client.

12:13.980 --> 12:16.216
Bobby, we can't force him
to accept an offer

12:16.249 --> 12:17.584
if he doesn't--
DONNELL: It's not about forcing.

12:17.618 --> 12:19.586
It's about making him
understand.

12:19.620 --> 12:20.521
We did that.

12:20.554 --> 12:21.522
He understood.

12:21.555 --> 12:23.089
DONNELL:
Please have him come in

12:23.123 --> 12:24.357
for one more meeting.

12:28.328 --> 12:30.463
FRUTT: The idea
of treating somebody,

12:30.496 --> 12:33.166
healing her,
making her well,

12:33.199 --> 12:34.635
so that you can
then kill her,

12:34.668 --> 12:36.670
that itself
is insane.

12:36.703 --> 12:38.505
The court has done this
many times.

12:38.539 --> 12:40.641
It's one thing
to force-medicate

12:40.674 --> 12:42.809
so a defendant
can help herself at trial.

12:42.843 --> 12:45.378
It's quite another
to facilitate killing her.

12:45.411 --> 12:46.146
SEYMOUR: Hold on.

12:47.147 --> 12:50.517
Mr. Parker, I don't mean
to be picking on you,

12:50.551 --> 12:52.085
but I agree
with Ms. Frutt here.

12:52.118 --> 12:56.222
The idea of medicating
a person against his or her will

12:56.256 --> 12:58.291
is in and of itself suspect.

12:58.324 --> 13:00.701
To do so, to make her fit
for execution,

13:00.734 --> 13:04.370
offends common sense,
as it does common decency.

13:04.404 --> 13:05.872
How decent is it
to let these people

13:05.906 --> 13:07.373
manipulate the system,

13:07.407 --> 13:09.009
distort the spirit of the law?

13:09.042 --> 13:10.877
Your motion is denied.

13:12.112 --> 13:13.647
Thank you.

13:13.680 --> 13:15.549
Your Honor, at this time,

13:15.582 --> 13:17.383
we would like
a declaratory judgment,

13:17.417 --> 13:19.886
that should my client go back
on medication,

13:19.920 --> 13:21.421
making herself sane,

13:21.454 --> 13:23.123
she will not be executed.

13:25.391 --> 13:26.893
Say that again?

13:26.927 --> 13:30.597
To force my client to live out
her life mentally ill,

13:30.631 --> 13:34.434
to be denied medication,
that certainly constitutes cruel

13:34.467 --> 13:37.237
and unusual punishment
under the Eighth Amendment.

13:37.270 --> 13:40.306
SEYMOUR: Counsel,
what are you trying to pull?

13:40.340 --> 13:43.209
Your client is choosing
to be off the medication.

13:43.243 --> 13:45.245
FRUTT: I would argue
that she really doesn't have

13:45.278 --> 13:46.613
such a choice, Your Honor,

13:46.647 --> 13:49.716
if the consequence
of being medicated is death.

13:50.183 --> 13:51.151
You got to be kidding.

13:51.184 --> 13:53.720
You can't say to a sick inmate,

13:53.754 --> 13:54.955
"We're willing to treat you,

13:54.988 --> 13:56.823
but if you get well,
you die."

13:57.323 --> 13:58.759
If that's her option,

13:58.792 --> 14:01.001
she's basically
being denied treatment.

14:01.034 --> 14:02.836
It's cruel and unusual.

14:04.037 --> 14:05.438
That is so ingenious,

14:05.471 --> 14:09.342
I'm surprised no lawyer
has thought of it before.

14:09.375 --> 14:12.513
But I'm not going to let you
have it both ways.

14:12.546 --> 14:15.315
As long as she's insane,
she lives.

14:15.348 --> 14:18.184
If she becomes sane again,
she dies.

14:18.218 --> 14:20.086
The choice is hers,

14:20.120 --> 14:22.422
or, since
you're the guardian ad litem,

14:22.455 --> 14:24.357
I guess it's yours.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.027
We're adjourned.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.795
(gavel bangs)

14:28.829 --> 14:31.765
(music playing)

14:35.636 --> 14:37.237
(buzzer buzzes)

14:45.746 --> 14:48.214
The news is good
and bad.

14:49.583 --> 14:52.385
The judge ruled that
they can't force-medicate you.

14:52.418 --> 14:53.620
What about my pills?

14:53.654 --> 14:55.055
When can I take my pills?

14:55.088 --> 14:56.489
That's the bad news.

14:57.691 --> 15:00.166
If you go back
on the medication,

15:00.200 --> 15:01.234
they'll execute you.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.436
Well, I can't stay like this.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.337
It's too loud.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.772
FRUTT: Denise,
I'd like to work

15:05.806 --> 15:06.573
on an appeal.

15:06.607 --> 15:07.574
It's too loud.

15:07.608 --> 15:10.076
You said
that you would make it stop.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.111
I will.
FREEMAN: Ellenor,

15:11.144 --> 15:12.112
it needs to be now!

15:12.145 --> 15:13.246
I can't.

15:13.279 --> 15:13.980
No!

15:14.014 --> 15:14.748
No!

15:14.781 --> 15:15.916
Then let me die!

15:15.949 --> 15:17.383
I'm choosing
to be executed!

15:17.417 --> 15:19.686
FRUTT: It's actually
not your choice.

15:19.720 --> 15:20.654
You have no capacity--

15:20.687 --> 15:21.555
Yet you said

15:21.588 --> 15:23.590
that you would make it stop!

15:23.624 --> 15:25.425
It's loud!

15:27.127 --> 15:28.962
We can at least get her
to a hospital now, right?

15:28.995 --> 15:30.597
If she's--
Shut up!

15:30.631 --> 15:31.431
You shut up!

15:31.464 --> 15:32.265
You shut up!

15:37.871 --> 15:40.941
That bitch is against me.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.910
(music playing)

15:46.580 --> 15:48.014
Mr. and Mrs. Berry,
Bobby Donnell.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.049
Thanks for coming in.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.517
I'm not sure
what the purpose is.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.485
Eugene tells me
you want us to settle,

15:52.519 --> 15:54.220
but I've made
our feelings quite clear.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.157
You're not going
to get any money, Mr. Berry,

15:57.190 --> 15:59.159
not by pursuing this.

15:59.192 --> 16:00.534
The alcohol industry--

16:00.567 --> 16:02.503
Can't afford to set
a precedent of losing.

16:02.536 --> 16:03.704
Yes.

16:03.737 --> 16:05.338
Eugene has already
told me that.

16:05.371 --> 16:06.607
But as I told him,

16:06.640 --> 16:08.241
I don't care
if I never see any money.

16:08.274 --> 16:09.576
Yes, but we do.

16:09.610 --> 16:10.577
I'm sorry?

16:10.611 --> 16:11.512
DONNELL: We took this case

16:11.545 --> 16:13.814
on a contingency,
Mr. Berry.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.882
There's an implied contract
of good faith.

16:15.916 --> 16:19.052
Good faith requires you to
accept a reasonable settlement.

16:19.085 --> 16:23.056
Failure to do so may give us
a cause of action against you.

16:23.089 --> 16:23.890
Bobby.

16:23.924 --> 16:26.226
DONNELL: 825,000 of 2.5

16:26.259 --> 16:27.561
belongs to us, Mr. Berry,

16:27.594 --> 16:28.995
and I'm not gonna let you
give that away

16:29.029 --> 16:30.396
because you're too emotional--

16:30.430 --> 16:31.765
Bobby.
DONNELL: Excuse me, Eugene.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.469
Lawsuits are about money.

16:36.503 --> 16:38.539
You hired us
to get you money.

16:38.572 --> 16:42.142
We prosecuted this claim
for free on a contingency.

16:42.175 --> 16:45.445
We took a chance on a back end,
and now we want our payoff.

16:45.478 --> 16:46.880
What are you talking about?

16:46.913 --> 16:47.948
DONNELL: The choice to settle

16:47.981 --> 16:50.150
or not to settle legally
belongs to you,

16:50.183 --> 16:52.418
but if you choose not to,
and you end up getting nothing,

16:52.452 --> 16:55.355
if we end up getting nothing,

16:55.388 --> 16:57.190
this firm will file
a claim against you

16:57.223 --> 17:00.701
for $825,000.

17:00.734 --> 17:02.235
And please keep in mind,
Mr. Berry,

17:02.268 --> 17:03.670
when you are the defendant,

17:03.704 --> 17:06.507
lawyers won't represent you
on a contingency.

17:09.542 --> 17:13.079
Turning this settlement down
will cost you.

17:14.548 --> 17:15.882
You need to be aware of that.

17:20.386 --> 17:22.255
Thank you for your time.

17:22.288 --> 17:25.224
(music playing)

17:43.510 --> 17:45.078
You could lose your bar card
over that one.

17:45.111 --> 17:46.412
I don't think so.

17:46.446 --> 17:47.914
Eugene, we need cash.

17:47.948 --> 17:50.283
Threatening a lawsuit
against a client to get cash?

17:50.316 --> 17:52.953
The client needed a dose
of reality.

17:52.986 --> 17:53.854
Then why didn't you
tell me and Jimmy,

17:53.887 --> 17:54.721
that's what
you were planning--

17:54.755 --> 17:55.889
Because I was taking you
off the hook.

17:55.922 --> 17:57.591
The fact that you didn't know
what the meeting was about

17:57.624 --> 17:59.492
makes me the only bad guy.

17:59.526 --> 18:02.368
Well, your threat to sue
is completely frivolous.

18:02.402 --> 18:03.704
I told the client as much

18:03.737 --> 18:06.372
and he maintains
his refusal to settle.

18:06.406 --> 18:08.074
We go in tomorrow
on the defendant's motion

18:08.108 --> 18:10.711
to knock the verdict down.

18:10.744 --> 18:13.013
Bobby, you and I
have been estranged lately.

18:13.046 --> 18:15.849
A lot of it's been over
the Catholic Church,

18:15.882 --> 18:19.419
but at least we've managed
to be honest with one another,

18:19.452 --> 18:20.554
so I'm gonna be honest now.

18:21.988 --> 18:23.123
What you just did,

18:23.156 --> 18:26.259
it wasn't in keeping
with being an ethical person,

18:26.292 --> 18:28.261
it wasn't in keeping
with being an honorable lawyer,

18:28.294 --> 18:30.296
and from what I know
of your faith,

18:30.330 --> 18:32.398
it wasn't in keeping
with being a good Catholic.

18:34.200 --> 18:38.004
You humiliated this firm
with that little performance.

18:39.105 --> 18:42.008
And more than that,

18:42.042 --> 18:44.044
you embarrassed yourself.

18:48.414 --> 18:49.950
(door opens)

18:52.986 --> 18:55.121
She started banging her head
against the bars

18:55.155 --> 18:57.423
and looked like she was trying
to gouge her eyes.

18:58.191 --> 18:59.459
FRUTT: Is she sedated?

18:59.492 --> 19:02.302
MARSHALL:
(sighs) Not yet.

19:02.335 --> 19:03.504
She's in restraints.

19:03.537 --> 19:05.438
She wanted to talk to you first.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.011
FRUTT: Denise?

19:11.044 --> 19:12.879
I want the drugs.

19:12.913 --> 19:15.315
I can't live like this, Ellenor.

19:15.348 --> 19:16.449
Try to calm--

19:16.482 --> 19:18.184
Don't tell me that!

19:18.218 --> 19:20.120
I can't live like this!

19:20.153 --> 19:22.523
FRUTT: Denise,
if you go back on the--

19:22.556 --> 19:23.356
I know!

19:23.389 --> 19:24.190
I know!

19:24.224 --> 19:25.992
FRUTT: I need you
to listen to me!

19:26.026 --> 19:28.161
If you go back on the drugs,

19:28.194 --> 19:30.564
they will put you to death.

19:30.597 --> 19:32.265
I can't live--

19:32.298 --> 19:34.868
it's too loud!

19:34.901 --> 19:36.503
I want the medicine!

19:36.537 --> 19:38.605
They said
that it's your decision!

19:38.639 --> 19:40.641
Tell them to give it to me!

19:40.674 --> 19:42.709
I would be signing
your death warrant.

19:42.743 --> 19:43.644
FREEMAN: Now!

19:47.247 --> 19:49.249
(sobbing)

19:49.282 --> 19:50.283
Give her the drugs.

19:51.918 --> 19:53.787
MARSHALL: Ellenor, are you sure?

19:53.820 --> 19:55.922
Of course I'm not sure.

19:55.956 --> 19:57.157
Give her the drugs.

19:59.593 --> 20:00.333
Now!

20:00.366 --> 20:03.303
(music playing)

20:15.381 --> 20:18.251
(breathing rapidly)

20:19.019 --> 20:20.220
Great.

20:21.722 --> 20:24.024
I just helped
kill my client.

20:41.808 --> 20:42.543
Hey.

20:43.910 --> 20:44.711
Hey.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.048
Great news
from the hospital.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.384
Denise is feeling well enough
to be executed.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.388
You come up
with anything?

20:56.089 --> 20:58.358
Well, only thing left
is to argue

20:58.391 --> 20:59.993
it's unconstitutional
to kill her

21:00.026 --> 21:02.836
on Eighth
Amendment grounds.

21:02.869 --> 21:04.605
That's sort of
been tried, Jamie.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.907
Well, instead of arguing
the death penalty

21:06.940 --> 21:09.510
is per se unconstitutional,

21:09.543 --> 21:11.678
you could argue
it's cruel and unusual

21:11.712 --> 21:13.980
as applied
to Denise Freeman.

21:16.717 --> 21:18.552
It's our only shot, Ellenor.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.061
Hey.

21:28.094 --> 21:29.029
BERLUTI: Hey.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.866
The client's had
a change of heart.

21:32.899 --> 21:33.767
They agreed to settle.

21:35.035 --> 21:38.304
We chipped
the number up to 3.2.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.339
We're closed.

21:40.206 --> 21:41.207
Really?

21:41.241 --> 21:42.843
What changed their minds?

21:42.876 --> 21:45.211
I guess you did.

21:45.245 --> 21:46.312
Congratulations.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.048
That's a good
settlement, Jimmy.

21:48.081 --> 21:49.382
For you, maybe.

21:49.415 --> 21:51.117
For the client.

21:51.151 --> 21:54.087
Well, that would be
a lucky coincidence then,

21:54.120 --> 21:55.021
wouldn't it?

21:56.990 --> 21:58.124
Don't pretend you had

21:58.158 --> 22:00.300
the client's interest
in mind, Bobby.

22:01.201 --> 22:03.604
Maybe I had yours,

22:03.637 --> 22:04.938
and Rebecca's,

22:04.971 --> 22:05.672
and Ellenor's.

22:07.674 --> 22:11.477
You think it's easy
running this place, Jimmy?

22:11.512 --> 22:13.046
You like taking home
a salary?

22:13.079 --> 22:13.980
You wanna see the books?

22:16.182 --> 22:19.319
I don't doubt in your heart

22:19.352 --> 22:22.188
you are serving the firm,

22:22.222 --> 22:23.423
but I guess--

22:25.325 --> 22:28.695
I just wish when serving us,

22:28.729 --> 22:31.665
you'd consider what at heart

22:31.698 --> 22:32.899
this firm is.

22:37.804 --> 22:39.806
Anyway,

22:39.840 --> 22:41.542
congratulations again

22:41.575 --> 22:43.409
on the settlement.

22:49.049 --> 22:50.483
I'm sorry.

22:50.517 --> 22:52.252
You now want to challenge

22:52.285 --> 22:54.621
the constitutionality
of the death penalty?

22:54.655 --> 22:56.422
FRUTT: As it applies
to my client, yes.

22:56.456 --> 22:57.558
And the show goes on.

22:57.591 --> 22:58.592
I object to that.

22:58.625 --> 22:59.626
This is not a show.

22:59.660 --> 23:01.201
My client is scheduled

23:01.234 --> 23:01.935
to be injected

23:01.968 --> 23:03.036
with lethal poison

23:03.069 --> 23:03.937
the day after tomorrow.

23:03.970 --> 23:04.771
Your client murdered

23:04.805 --> 23:06.239
two young boys

23:06.272 --> 23:06.973
and has since been
on a mission

23:07.007 --> 23:08.141
to manipulate the system!

23:08.174 --> 23:10.110
To say nothing--
She is entitled to be heard,

23:10.143 --> 23:10.944
Mr. Parker!

23:10.977 --> 23:11.912
All right!

23:13.079 --> 23:14.748
Ms. Frutt, I must admit

23:14.781 --> 23:17.050
I share Mr. Parker's
exasperation.

23:17.083 --> 23:20.921
FRUTT: Your Honor,
you represent Denise Freeman's

23:20.954 --> 23:22.422
last chance at life.

23:23.289 --> 23:25.225
It is certainly
within your discretion

23:25.258 --> 23:27.393
to let her die.

23:27.427 --> 23:29.863
But it would be an abuse
of that discretion to do so

23:29.896 --> 23:32.432
without at least hearing
from her attorney.

23:32.465 --> 23:34.000
I've done nothing
but hear from you!

23:34.034 --> 23:34.768
Damn it!

23:36.269 --> 23:37.437
Say no if you want,

23:37.470 --> 23:39.105
but I would like to be heard,

23:39.139 --> 23:41.642
however much it exasperates
the court's patience.

23:44.410 --> 23:46.379
Speak to me like that again,

23:46.412 --> 23:48.649
you'll get a jail cell
of your very own.

23:53.053 --> 23:55.188
All right.

23:55.221 --> 23:55.956
Let's go back in.

23:55.989 --> 23:56.823
I'll hear you.

23:56.857 --> 23:58.158
I need time to prepare.

24:01.635 --> 24:04.337
9:00 tomorrow.

24:04.370 --> 24:05.739
Last call, Counsel.

24:10.343 --> 24:11.377
FRUTT: I need you
to pull up Furman.

24:11.411 --> 24:12.779
Check the concurring opinions.

24:12.813 --> 24:15.115
See if there's any language
we can make use of.

24:15.148 --> 24:16.617
Then pull up Gregg.

24:16.650 --> 24:18.451
Look for any
dissenting opinion.

24:18.484 --> 24:19.720
Are you holding up?

24:21.555 --> 24:22.388
I'm fine.

24:22.422 --> 24:23.356
I'm gonna go see Denise.

24:23.389 --> 24:24.424
You get the cases.

24:24.457 --> 24:25.592
I'll meet you back
at the hotel.

24:25.626 --> 24:26.927
STRINGER: Okay.

24:30.997 --> 24:32.132
FREEMAN:
Is the ACLU coming in

24:32.165 --> 24:32.899
with you?

24:34.868 --> 24:35.802
Well...

24:38.371 --> 24:39.305
no.

24:40.607 --> 24:41.542
So you're going to try

24:41.575 --> 24:43.009
to overturn
the death penalty

24:43.043 --> 24:44.110
all by yourself?

24:45.311 --> 24:47.881
You could go back off
the medication,

24:47.914 --> 24:50.116
though I'm not even sure--

24:50.150 --> 24:51.685
I won't do that again.

24:53.453 --> 24:55.989
I either live on the meds,

24:56.022 --> 24:57.157
or I die.

24:59.225 --> 25:00.901
So, Ellenor,

25:02.268 --> 25:04.170
exactly how good are you?

25:05.471 --> 25:06.840
I'm not this good.

25:09.142 --> 25:10.110
Obviously, Denise,

25:10.143 --> 25:13.079
this is the ultimate
Hail Mary.

25:14.480 --> 25:17.818
I will do my very best, but...

25:20.120 --> 25:21.087
We're at the end.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.592
I'm afraid so.

25:29.429 --> 25:30.363
FREEMAN: Well,

25:32.398 --> 25:35.569
I don't know how to begin
thanking you for...

25:36.803 --> 25:38.204
We don't have
to get into that.

25:41.241 --> 25:42.543
FRUTT: I've arranged for you

25:42.576 --> 25:45.846
to be present in court, so...

25:47.013 --> 25:49.716
One last outing.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.084
Should I try to escape?

25:56.289 --> 25:58.692
Well,

25:58.725 --> 26:02.168
I should probably get
to work on...

26:02.202 --> 26:04.738
whatever it is I'm gonna say.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.444
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

26:11.477 --> 26:13.346
Okay.

26:13.379 --> 26:15.949
(music playing)

26:15.982 --> 26:16.917
Okay.

26:32.465 --> 26:34.200
BAILIFF: All rise.

26:41.675 --> 26:42.375
Be seated.

26:49.082 --> 26:51.451
Okay, Ms. Frutt, I'm listening.

27:00.901 --> 27:03.069
Whether one agrees
or disagrees

27:03.103 --> 27:03.904
with the death penalty--

27:03.937 --> 27:04.705
One does.

27:07.373 --> 27:10.243
It is reserved
as punishment

27:10.276 --> 27:11.945
for the worst
of criminals,

27:11.978 --> 27:14.681
the most terrible.

27:14.715 --> 27:17.350
Denise Freeman doesn't fall
into that category.

27:18.251 --> 27:21.287
Of course, her acts
of murder were heinous

27:21.321 --> 27:23.189
against God, and especially

27:23.223 --> 27:25.491
against two innocent,
young children.

27:26.627 --> 27:30.597
But Denise Freeman
was mentally ill.

27:30.631 --> 27:33.266
Though judged
legally sane by a jury,

27:33.299 --> 27:35.636
she clearly wasn't.

27:35.669 --> 27:38.705
She was diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia

27:38.739 --> 27:40.674
shortly after the trial.

27:40.707 --> 27:44.277
Medication not only successfully
treated this disease,

27:44.310 --> 27:46.246
but she developed
into a role model,

27:46.279 --> 27:49.550
offering such profound
public service to others

27:49.583 --> 27:52.085
that Steven Marshall,
the Warden

27:52.118 --> 27:53.954
at the Goffstown
Correctional Facility,

27:53.987 --> 27:55.255
has petitioned you

27:55.288 --> 27:58.058
to save her life.

27:58.091 --> 27:59.893
Had Ms. Freeman received

27:59.926 --> 28:01.802
an adequate defense,
she likely--

28:01.835 --> 28:05.438
Counsel, this is neither
a retrial of the facts

28:05.471 --> 28:06.907
nor your client's defense.

28:06.940 --> 28:09.943
I understand that,
Your Honor,

28:09.976 --> 28:12.378
but you are permitted
to consider

28:12.412 --> 28:14.380
that the finding
of sanity was made

28:14.414 --> 28:15.782
by 12 laypeople,

28:15.816 --> 28:19.419
with almost no psychiatric
testimony introduced

28:19.452 --> 28:20.787
on my client's behalf.

28:20.821 --> 28:23.590
You are allowed to consider

28:23.624 --> 28:25.759
that Denise Freeman was poor,

28:25.792 --> 28:29.630
that her murder trial
lasted a total of three days,

28:29.663 --> 28:32.332
her defense taking up one day.

28:33.133 --> 28:34.835
You are allowed to consider

28:34.868 --> 28:38.772
that the overwhelming
medical evidence found her

28:38.805 --> 28:41.141
to be insane.

28:41.174 --> 28:42.776
And as such, I would submit

28:42.809 --> 28:45.445
you are certainly
allowed to conclude

28:45.478 --> 28:47.848
that Denise Freeman
does not fall

28:47.881 --> 28:51.718
into "the most
terrible of criminals,"

28:51.752 --> 28:54.320
the ones for which we reserve

28:54.354 --> 28:55.522
the penalty of death.

28:56.757 --> 28:58.625
And I would also remind
the court

28:58.659 --> 29:01.702
that as horrible
as these murders were,

29:02.636 --> 29:04.805
they did not involve
rape or torture.

29:05.639 --> 29:09.075
There was no evidence
of any physical suffering.

29:09.109 --> 29:11.477
The deaths were instantaneous.

29:11.512 --> 29:13.714
She did not act

29:13.747 --> 29:16.583
out of hatred or evil.

29:18.351 --> 29:21.454
If you are to execute
a mentally ill person

29:21.487 --> 29:23.456
who kills painlessly,

29:23.489 --> 29:25.058
without judgment,

29:25.091 --> 29:28.061
without premeditation,

29:28.094 --> 29:29.295
then we are to say

29:29.329 --> 29:32.065
all murderers
should be executed,

29:32.098 --> 29:33.567
and we don't say that,
Your Honor.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.003
Instead, we reserve
the penalty of death

29:37.037 --> 29:38.772
for the most evil,

29:38.805 --> 29:40.741
the most dastardly.

29:41.708 --> 29:45.045
Denise Freeman
simply does not fall

29:45.078 --> 29:46.312
into that category,

29:46.346 --> 29:49.616
and her punishment
should accordingly

29:49.650 --> 29:51.918
be reduced
to life imprisonment.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.180
We judge the criminal act,

30:14.214 --> 30:16.817
not the criminal actor.

30:16.850 --> 30:18.585
When a young child
is murdered,

30:18.619 --> 30:21.688
that's the most terrible
of crimes.

30:21.722 --> 30:22.823
When two are murdered--

30:24.691 --> 30:26.359
this murderer was judged sane,

30:26.392 --> 30:27.427
Your Honor.

30:27.460 --> 30:29.329
Ms. Frutt knows this.

30:29.362 --> 30:31.364
She's here mostly
because she's against

30:31.397 --> 30:32.298
the death penalty.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.299
Objection!

30:33.333 --> 30:34.067
I say this only

30:34.100 --> 30:35.501
to put her eloquent pleas

30:35.536 --> 30:36.737
in a proper context.

30:36.770 --> 30:38.404
The commitment that she feigns

30:38.438 --> 30:41.575
towards Denise Freeman's life
is inextricably bound up

30:41.608 --> 30:43.877
with her opposition
to the death penalty.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.178
Mr. Parker,

30:45.211 --> 30:46.947
I'll ask you
to confine your remarks

30:46.980 --> 30:49.449
to this case only.

30:49.482 --> 30:50.584
PARKER: All right, Your Honor.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.920
Ms. Frutt said
that these crimes

30:53.954 --> 30:56.056
didn't involve
much suffering.

30:57.691 --> 30:59.392
Here sit Arnold
and Cindy Graham,

31:00.166 --> 31:01.568
the boys' parents.

31:01.602 --> 31:04.170
This woman
was at the park that day.

31:04.204 --> 31:05.572
She saw the heads

31:05.606 --> 31:07.407
of her only two
children explode.

31:08.274 --> 31:10.410
They've had to go
through trials and tribulations

31:10.443 --> 31:11.978
for eight long years,

31:12.012 --> 31:14.615
waiting for this day,
for closure,

31:14.648 --> 31:16.550
only to have
to come to this room

31:16.583 --> 31:18.519
to listen
to a defense attorney claim

31:18.552 --> 31:21.287
that the murders
weren't terrible enough,

31:21.321 --> 31:23.289
not enough suffering,

31:23.323 --> 31:24.758
no evil at work.

31:24.791 --> 31:28.094
They've had to witness
a last-minute gross distortion

31:28.128 --> 31:29.429
of our legal system,

31:29.462 --> 31:31.097
where the killer
goes off medication

31:31.131 --> 31:32.165
for the purpose

31:32.198 --> 31:34.467
of becoming too insane
to execute.

31:35.368 --> 31:37.437
I asked before,
I'll ask you again,

31:37.470 --> 31:39.472
where does it stop?

31:43.176 --> 31:46.046
Uh, when I grow up,
I wanna be vice-president.

31:46.079 --> 31:47.681
Vice-Presidents get
to have girlfriends,

31:47.714 --> 31:49.349
and people
don't make a big deal.

31:49.382 --> 31:50.817
RYAN (over TV): You're gonna
have a girlfriend?

31:50.851 --> 31:51.685
Lots of them.

31:51.718 --> 31:52.653
I got that "thang."

31:52.686 --> 31:53.954
Girls like it.

31:53.987 --> 31:54.888
RYAN (over TV): What thang?

31:54.921 --> 31:56.623
That thang I got.

31:56.657 --> 31:58.191
Timothy Graham
for VP,

31:58.224 --> 31:59.693
the candidate
with "thang."

32:05.005 --> 32:07.107
Tim Graham won't get to run
for vice-president.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.777
In the last eight years,

32:10.811 --> 32:13.947
Denise Freeman got to laugh,

32:13.980 --> 32:15.716
Timothy and Ryan Graham didn't.

32:16.449 --> 32:19.119
Denise Freeman experienced
joy on occasion,

32:20.120 --> 32:22.956
Timothy and Ryan didn't.

32:22.989 --> 32:26.392
Denise Freeman got to live,

32:26.426 --> 32:28.094
Timothy and Ryan didn't.

32:29.395 --> 32:32.432
Society can only express
its feelings for crime

32:32.465 --> 32:34.601
by the punishment it metes out.

32:34.635 --> 32:37.704
To let her live now
is to ignore and prolong

32:37.738 --> 32:40.440
the misery of these parents,

32:40.473 --> 32:43.376
and to say that the life
of Denise Freeman...

32:45.445 --> 32:47.514
matters more than those
two innocent children.

33:00.834 --> 33:02.936
Ms. Frutt,

33:02.969 --> 33:04.470
I'll give you the final word.

33:15.448 --> 33:17.250
FRUTT: I have
a two-year-old daughter.

33:17.283 --> 33:19.419
If somebody
were to shoot her dead

33:19.452 --> 33:21.354
on a jungle gym,

33:21.387 --> 33:23.489
I would not only want
that person killed,

33:23.524 --> 33:24.925
I would like
the satisfaction

33:24.958 --> 33:26.326
of doing it myself.

33:26.359 --> 33:29.029
I would even want
that killer to suffer.

33:29.062 --> 33:31.331
It's human nature,

33:32.132 --> 33:34.067
but it isn't right.

33:35.902 --> 33:38.138
One of the reasons
I'm here today

33:38.171 --> 33:39.740
is because my daughter

33:39.773 --> 33:42.609
is still alive,

33:42.643 --> 33:44.978
and I worry about the world

33:45.011 --> 33:46.379
we pass on to her.

33:47.548 --> 33:49.516
I plan to teach my little girl

33:49.550 --> 33:52.185
that it is never okay
to commit murder,

33:52.218 --> 33:54.588
though the state
says otherwise.

33:55.188 --> 33:57.190
I plan to teach my daughter

33:57.223 --> 33:59.660
that we do not respond
to violence

33:59.693 --> 34:01.535
with more violence
or vengeance,

34:01.568 --> 34:03.937
though the state
says otherwise.

34:04.905 --> 34:06.640
I plan to teach her

34:06.673 --> 34:10.176
that life, every life,
is sacred,

34:10.210 --> 34:13.614
though the state
says otherwise.

34:13.647 --> 34:16.315
In truth, the murder
being advocated

34:16.349 --> 34:17.650
by the government today

34:17.684 --> 34:20.821
is far more premeditated
than the ones committed

34:20.853 --> 34:21.987
by Denise Freeman.

34:22.022 --> 34:23.757
The murder being advocated

34:23.790 --> 34:25.391
by the government today

34:25.425 --> 34:27.728
is with clarity of mind,

34:27.761 --> 34:28.829
with reason,

34:28.862 --> 34:30.263
and with much more hatred

34:30.295 --> 34:31.496
in the heart

34:31.532 --> 34:33.699
than was true
of Denise Freeman.

34:33.734 --> 34:35.569
The murder being advocated

34:35.601 --> 34:38.539
by the government today
is one of ceremony.

34:41.274 --> 34:44.077
Killing Denise Freeman
might bring closure

34:44.110 --> 34:46.312
for the victims' family.

34:46.346 --> 34:48.514
It will no doubt bring cheers

34:48.549 --> 34:52.085
from much of the community,

34:52.118 --> 34:54.154
but it isn't right.

34:56.857 --> 34:58.358
When I was a kid,

34:58.391 --> 35:00.366
I memorized
Clarence Darrow's

35:00.400 --> 35:02.268
closing argument
on Leopold and Loeb.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.607
It's what made me
wanna become a lawyer.

35:06.640 --> 35:07.841
I often wondered

35:07.874 --> 35:11.111
if I'd ever have
a case like that,

35:11.144 --> 35:14.347
where I would stand
before a judge

35:14.380 --> 35:15.616
and ask him to spare

35:15.649 --> 35:17.651
another human being's life.

35:18.785 --> 35:22.188
I can't improve
on Clarence Darrow,

35:22.222 --> 35:24.490
so I will finish
with what he said.

35:26.727 --> 35:30.130
"I am pleading
for the future.

35:30.163 --> 35:33.333
I am pleading for a time
when hatred and cruelty

35:33.366 --> 35:36.637
will not control
the hearts of men,

35:36.670 --> 35:40.641
when we can learn
by reason and judgment,

35:40.674 --> 35:42.308
and understanding

35:42.342 --> 35:44.645
and faith,

35:44.678 --> 35:48.381
that all life
is worth saving,

35:48.414 --> 35:50.517
and that mercy

35:50.551 --> 35:53.587
is the highest
attribute of man."

35:53.620 --> 35:56.557
(music playing)

36:15.782 --> 36:17.183
Ellenor...

36:19.052 --> 36:20.386
honestly...

36:23.690 --> 36:25.225
if I killed your daughter,

36:27.160 --> 36:29.963
do you think you could
find it in your heart

36:29.996 --> 36:32.032
to argue for my life?

36:32.065 --> 36:34.100
Absolutely not.

36:36.903 --> 36:40.574
So, all that talk

36:40.607 --> 36:43.243
about kindness
overcoming cruelty--

36:43.276 --> 36:46.780
I believe in it, totally,

36:49.149 --> 36:51.184
except if anyone harmed
my daughter.

37:00.333 --> 37:02.401
You didn't quote
my favorite part.

37:03.236 --> 37:04.170
I'm sorry?

37:05.004 --> 37:06.472
Darrow's closing.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.908
He talked about how...

37:08.942 --> 37:11.645
we used to hang,

37:11.678 --> 37:13.547
and behead,

37:13.580 --> 37:15.582
and torture

37:15.615 --> 37:19.152
and cut into pieces,

37:19.185 --> 37:22.222
all these inconceivable
punishments.

37:23.957 --> 37:26.827
But then, we began to evolve

37:26.860 --> 37:28.829
as a nation

37:28.862 --> 37:31.131
to a point
where now we look back

37:31.164 --> 37:34.000
on those things
with horror.

37:35.669 --> 37:37.838
He said the future
was on his side,

37:38.371 --> 37:39.773
because one day

37:39.806 --> 37:41.975
we, too, would look back

37:42.008 --> 37:44.110
at capital punishment

37:44.144 --> 37:47.213
with embarrassment and shame.

37:51.518 --> 37:54.588
"The future is with me,"

37:54.621 --> 37:56.022
he said.

38:01.067 --> 38:04.771
We need the future
to be today.

38:07.908 --> 38:09.843
(door opens)

38:12.345 --> 38:13.614
Judge is coming in.

38:23.757 --> 38:25.592
BAILIFF: Be seated.

38:32.933 --> 38:34.400
Stand up, Ms. Freeman.

38:38.639 --> 38:41.474
Ms. Frutt, as much
as you'd like me

38:41.508 --> 38:43.810
to overturn the death penalty,

38:43.844 --> 38:45.145
I'm not going to do that.

38:45.746 --> 38:48.949
Anybody who murders
two innocent children,

38:48.982 --> 38:51.217
I have a difficult time

38:51.251 --> 38:52.719
having that person's attorney

38:52.753 --> 38:54.454
preach to me on morality.

38:56.089 --> 38:58.391
But I have to acknowledge

38:58.424 --> 39:01.301
the evidence is overwhelming.

39:01.334 --> 39:03.369
If not insane, Ms. Freeman

39:03.403 --> 39:06.139
was at least mentally infirm

39:06.172 --> 39:07.440
at the time she committed

39:07.473 --> 39:09.543
those heinous acts.

39:11.177 --> 39:14.180
I therefore find
that the death penalty

39:14.214 --> 39:16.049
is not appropriate here,

39:17.918 --> 39:20.721
and the execution
is hereby stayed.

39:23.524 --> 39:24.791
That's all.

39:24.825 --> 39:27.761
(music playing)

39:47.614 --> 39:49.149
I live.

39:52.185 --> 39:53.654
You live.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.436
(music playing)

40:31.832 --> 40:33.299
YOUNG: Next on The Practice.

40:34.067 --> 40:35.969
Hey, get out the truck.

40:39.105 --> 40:40.574
MILLER: I saw the gun
and then I just hit

40:40.607 --> 40:41.407
the accelerator.

40:41.441 --> 40:42.576
Did you call the police?

40:42.609 --> 40:43.343
No.

40:43.376 --> 40:44.177
What?

40:44.210 --> 40:45.679
GAMBLE: The man
your client ran over

40:45.712 --> 40:47.280
in her garage,

40:47.313 --> 40:48.915
he had a bullet in his back.

40:49.650 --> 40:51.351
DONNELL: Do you have feelings
for this woman?

40:51.384 --> 40:53.186
I might love her.

40:53.219 --> 40:55.756
DONNELL: You have to think
of her as a client.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.457
I can't do that, Bobby.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.436
(music playing)

41:26.426 --> 41:27.994
WOMAN: You stinker!

41:28.028 --> 41:30.931
(music playing)
