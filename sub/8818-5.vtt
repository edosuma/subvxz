04:41.489 --> 04:43.282
- Cool!

04:43.366 --> 04:45.827
What's an amplifier?

before you use it.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.372

about it.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.687
- Think about it?
I've dreamt about it.

05:12.770 --> 05:15.898

request is "no," Miss Cruz.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.442
Jessie violated
the rule book.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.360
Not only that, by putting
a spell on Ben,

05:19.444 --> 05:23.239
she manipulated the outcome
of the final exam.

05:23.322 --> 05:25.908
You're lucky
I didn't have her expelled.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.160

been my choice.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.078
- But it wasn't
Jessie's fault.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.039
I asked her to
heal Ben's wrist.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.665
- Oh, then you shall
both be punished.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.875
- Nice!

05:33.958 --> 05:36.294
- Uh, define "punished"?

05:36.377 --> 05:38.129

05:38.212 --> 05:39.422
- What kind of chores?

05:39.505 --> 05:41.758
- Let's start with
cleaning the atrium.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.634
Cameron, have a mop
and bucket

05:43.718 --> 05:46.220

at lunch time.

05:46.304 --> 05:47.889
- And, um, what
about Jessie's powers?

05:47.972 --> 05:50.349
- She will get them back

05:50.433 --> 05:52.935
when I decide she deserves
to get them back.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.771

didn't it?

05:54.854 --> 06:00.526
- ♪

06:00.610 --> 06:02.820

with cleaning the atrium?

06:02.904 --> 06:04.322
- I did, indeed.

06:04.405 --> 06:07.950
Those two need to
learn how to get along.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.287
Hopefully, it will
be a bonding experience.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.809
The canister doesn't require
casting a rhyming spell.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.852
You just open it.

You are a doofus.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.984
And your underwear
is itchy.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.237
- I don't know how long
this spell will last.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.238
If I'm not back
after five minutes,

06:45.321 --> 06:47.782
use your magic
to bring me back.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.743
[sighing]

06:50.827 --> 06:55.456
It won't open.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.208

It says here...

06:57.291 --> 06:58.209
after all the warnings,

06:58.292 --> 07:00.002
that only a witch
or wizard with powers

07:00.086 --> 07:03.297
can open the canister.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.758
- You try.
You opened one before.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.510
- [as Ethan]
Actually, that was me.

07:07.593 --> 07:12.849
- Just untwist the top.
Then let me open it.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.517
- [as Ethan]
It's not working.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.687
I guess Emily isn't
strong enough.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.938
- You try then.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.440
- [as Emily] No way!
What if it hits me?

07:21.524 --> 07:24.026
- Just do it, Ethan.
I mean, Emily.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.069

You can't make me.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.363

07:27.446 --> 07:28.406
you refused to listen
to your Guardian.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.283
- [as Emily]
And I can tell Agamemnon

07:30.366 --> 07:32.034
you stole a spell
from his cabinet.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.412

07:34.495 --> 07:36.247

If you switch us back,

07:37.957 --> 07:39.709
I can totally
open it for you,

07:39.792 --> 07:41.544
you know, in my body.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.716

my powers on that tray.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.342
- I'm working on it.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.599
- I guess I'm
your favorite WIT.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.434
- Am I your favorite
Guardian?

07:56.517 --> 07:57.643
- I can't commit to that.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.062
- Sienna, Harris, find us
a table at the window.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.064
I'll be right there.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.567
Hello, roomie and Benny.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.152
- You're in a good mood.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.612
Did you find your
Spell-O-Vision lens?

08:07.695 --> 08:09.405
- No, but...

08:09.488 --> 08:10.698
I just saw Ruby
and her WITs

08:10.781 --> 08:12.825
scrubbing the floors
in the atrium.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.912
And that would put
anyone in a good mood.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.039
- Wait--Ruby's cleaning
the atrium?

08:18.122 --> 08:21.417
- I know. Can you imagine?
How embarrassing is that?

- AGAMEMNON ANNOUNCING:
Attention, students!

08:23.252 --> 08:27.048
Miss Cruz, have you forgotten
about your chores?

08:27.131 --> 08:29.050
Please report to
Cameron in the atrium.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.183
- Hey, Ruby.

08:37.265 --> 08:39.602
You missed a spot.

08:39.684 --> 08:42.020
- Then I suggest
you clean it up.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.280
- Can't hide from me
forever, you know?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.657
- Excuse me?

08:52.740 --> 08:54.575
- I know what
you did to Hex.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.787
- Oh, I guess
he got away.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.163
- Agamemnon is a genius.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.749
They're bonding already.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.543
- So your little magic
book told on me.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.835
Big deal.

09:04.919 --> 09:07.755
- Hex is my buddy and you
kidnapped and bullied him.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.173
It is a big deal.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.883
- Has your "buddy"
officially registered

09:10.967 --> 09:12.426
with the academy's
administration?

09:12.510 --> 09:14.804
Because, if not,
I'm sure Agamemnon

09:14.887 --> 09:17.390
would love to
hear your excuse.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.558
- Just stay away from Hex.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.981
- [as Ethan]
Find your own bucket, sis.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.483
- [as Emily]
This is my bucket, "sis"!

09:27.567 --> 09:29.277
- [mops snap]

09:29.360 --> 09:31.320
- You just damaged
school property.
