WEBVTT

00:16.551 --> 00:22.356
<i>Here at Magic Motors,
we make high prices disappear.</i>

00:27.461 --> 00:29.764
Prices disappear.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.332
They're not disappearing.

02:32.787 --> 02:33.788
Oh, he's coming!

02:52.439 --> 02:55.610
All right, you clowns, gather around
here, I wanna talk to you.

02:59.881 --> 03:03.751
I've got cars out there
gathering dust people!

03:03.785 --> 03:10.390
Now you stiffs have got to get John Q and
Jane Q's signatures on these contracts.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.761
And then you turn your
attention to the other lollipops

03:13.795 --> 03:15.663
that are coming onto the lot.

03:15.697 --> 03:19.634
Mr. Grismer,
some of them just want to look.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.669
Want to look?

03:21.703 --> 03:27.474
People come on this lot because they
prefer to drive, rather than walk.

03:27.508 --> 03:32.547
Now your job is to
sell from the heart.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.850
From the gut.
If you're not prepared to do that,

03:35.883 --> 03:39.687
then you can get your
low-production butt off my lot

03:39.721 --> 03:42.623
and make room
for somebody who is.

03:42.657 --> 03:46.527
Now, get out there and shove
those cars down their throats

03:46.561 --> 03:48.996
before I really blow a gasket!

03:55.503 --> 03:57.905
Somebody bring me
some hot coffee.

04:06.881 --> 04:08.883
Oh. Hi, little girl.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.718
Would you like to see
a magic trick?

04:10.752 --> 04:12.987
Can you make yourself
disappear?

04:13.020 --> 04:15.656
As soon as happy hour gets here.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.425
My dad says you probably
didn't go to college.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.028
My dad sells Cryptocurrency.

04:21.062 --> 04:24.632
Well, I sell wonder and amazement
under the guise of used car sales.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.001
He says in five years,
you'll be homeless.

04:27.034 --> 04:29.070
Well, that'd be a step up.
Now, beat it, kid,

04:29.103 --> 04:31.338
before I turn your freckles
into liver spots.

04:36.511 --> 04:40.413
I hear your attitude was
lousy out there today.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.650
Yeah, You know,
I think the smell of

04:42.683 --> 04:46.319
baby puke might have weakened
my charming personality.

04:46.353 --> 04:51.893
You're paid to entertain,
not depress everybody.

04:51.926 --> 04:54.929
I bring the stiffs in Grismer.
You know what?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.031
Sometimes I think you forget...

04:58.498 --> 05:01.569
who needs who.

05:01.602 --> 05:06.707
Pitchmen are a dime a dozen, and your
tricks are putting people to sleep.

05:06.741 --> 05:13.047
It's only a matter of time until your
dime-store magic isn't needed around here.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.850
And there'll come a time
when I land the big trick,

05:15.883 --> 05:18.519
people lined up around the block

05:18.553 --> 05:22.790
and you...
you begging me to stay.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:26.527 --> 05:31.132
Well, until that day happens
or until hell freezes over,

05:31.165 --> 05:33.501
you better shape up or ship out.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.504
Yeah. Yeah.

05:40.942 --> 05:44.078
I don't know how much
more of this I can take, Mike.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.378
Grismer?

05:46.948 --> 05:50.685
- I need a new job.
- Me too.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.554
You're too good for this place.
You should open your own shop.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.489
With what money?

05:56.524 --> 06:00.061
You're wasting your prime years, Mike...
on Grismer. Think about it.

06:00.094 --> 06:02.864
You are, too.

06:02.897 --> 06:07.400
Yes, but only physically.
Not my soaring soul.

06:09.604 --> 06:11.706
There's no magic here.

06:17.712 --> 06:20.948
Hey, Max.
Just waiting for backup.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.188
Doing okay there, buddy?

06:27.221 --> 06:30.992
Yeah, why do you ask?

06:31.025 --> 06:34.795
Well, it seems your friend
Vinnie is at it again.

06:34.829 --> 06:38.032
No, no, no. He's actually more of
a neighborly acquaintance, Carl.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.668
When he isn't blasted,
Vinnie is the kind of guy who

06:40.701 --> 06:42.970
makes death wishes before he
blows out his birthday candles.

06:43.004 --> 06:46.974
Wait, how often do you deal with
suicidal situations?

06:49.577 --> 06:52.780
Every morning.
Right before I walk into work.

06:55.917 --> 06:58.686
- Is that you, Max?
- Yeah.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.887
Yeah, me and

06:59.921 --> 07:01.789
three news crews
down the street.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.026
You're getting more press
than I am, Vinnie.

07:05.059 --> 07:07.494
I lost my job, Max.
I'm a failure!

07:07.528 --> 07:09.230
Yeah. Of course you are.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.232
- You've been drinking?
- No.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.835
- Why the hell not?
- I hate the world, Max!

07:14.869 --> 07:17.738
What's to hate, Vinnie?
You never leave your house.

07:17.772 --> 07:21.108
I should just hang myself
and get it over with.

07:21.142 --> 07:24.946
You'd look like a human pinata.

07:24.979 --> 07:28.049
- Hold on.
- I don't know if I can, Max.

07:28.082 --> 07:31.719
Kill me, please.
I want to die.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.121
- Oh, God.
- Hey! I haven't read that yet!

07:34.155 --> 07:37.024
It's the morning paper, Ralph.
It's five o'clock in the afternoon.

07:37.058 --> 07:39.894
Let me guess, Vinnie. Will you tell
him to just end it already, you?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.963
Yeah. I'll relay your
kind thoughts.

07:41.996 --> 07:44.932
Hey, Max. I want the
crossword section.

07:44.966 --> 07:48.169
Try and keep that commotion down.
I'm tired of that no-good bum.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.738
Your a humanitarian, Ralph,
did you know that?

07:51.639 --> 07:53.473
Okay, Vinnie.

07:54.809 --> 07:56.811
Guy with your looks is...

07:56.844 --> 08:00.081
- probably good with his hands.
- Yeah.

08:00.114 --> 08:02.116
A little shaky right now,
though.

08:02.149 --> 08:06.053
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
How about a maintenance job?

08:06.087 --> 08:08.956
I did fix your toaster
a few weeks back.

08:08.990 --> 08:12.293
Yeah. Yeah, It burns real good
on one side right now.

08:12.326 --> 08:17.765
You know, Vinnie, why don't you try
looking on the brighter side, huh?

08:17.798 --> 08:21.736
Remember, I once complained
about a hole in my shoe

08:21.769 --> 08:24.939
until I met a man
with no feet. Hmm?

08:24.972 --> 08:27.575
What does that mean?

08:27.608 --> 08:30.711
It means, Vinnie,
people got it worse than you.

08:30.745 --> 08:33.614
I know a guy,
works a nowhere job.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.650
No purpose in his life.
Drinks way too much.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.552
His father thinks he's a loser.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.621
He only has one friend
in the whole world.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.657
Can't even buy a date unless he
makes them his lovely assistant.

08:43.691 --> 08:48.129
Man! I'm glad
I'm not him, Max.

08:48.162 --> 08:52.633
He's just one signature trick
away from fame and fortune.

08:52.666 --> 08:59.774
Oh, so sad. Whoever this person
is, it made me appreciate my life.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.776
Who is this sorry excuse
for a human?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.677
I made him up!

09:05.846 --> 09:07.181
Vinnie.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.016
Go have a shot of scotch, huh?

09:09.050 --> 09:11.152
Then you draw a nice hot bath,

09:11.185 --> 09:14.288
with the bubbles
and the candles, like you like.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.992
Okay, Max,
you're a real good friend.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.596
Is that it? So now what?

09:22.630 --> 09:24.265
Now I go home
and try to figure out

09:24.298 --> 09:26.700
why skipping college
was a good idea.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.870
You know, I should probably take
him in this time, Max.

09:32.006 --> 09:35.810
If you don't, Carl, I'll do another
charity event for you guys. Huh?

09:40.981 --> 09:46.754
This should be a really good ending
to a really, really good day.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.356
Excuse me. Hi, Mom.

09:51.058 --> 09:54.895
What? Mom, slow...
Mom, slow down...

09:58.399 --> 09:59.867
What?

10:01.669 --> 10:04.205
I'm sorry, Max.

10:04.238 --> 10:08.976
I know you and your brother
weren't that close, but still,

10:09.009 --> 10:12.079
I'm really sorry.

10:12.113 --> 10:13.781
Shot out of the womb.

10:13.814 --> 10:18.152
Different directions,
then never came full circle.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.386
It's sad.

10:20.821 --> 10:24.091
Plane crash,
I can't believe it.

10:24.125 --> 10:28.362
He was with his wife, too.
I mean, the whole thing. It's just awful.

10:28.395 --> 10:33.901
- Beer me.
- Bet your dad is taking this hard, talking about life

10:33.934 --> 10:36.303
just turning on a dime.

10:36.337 --> 10:38.973
<i>Ole!</i>

10:39.006 --> 10:41.976
- How's he doing?
- Not good.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.879
But, I mean,

10:44.912 --> 10:48.249
I'm pretty sure he wants to stick
around long enough to watch me

10:48.282 --> 10:51.418
totally fail. So that's good.

10:54.355 --> 10:59.059
But, Timmy, my nephew.
No one to come home to for dinner.

10:59.093 --> 11:02.229
No one to say, "Hello, Tim."

11:02.263 --> 11:05.299
How was your day, dear?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.067
When was last time you saw him?

11:07.101 --> 11:10.004
He was seven, eight...

11:10.037 --> 11:14.275
- He's 10 now.
- Who gets 'em?

11:14.308 --> 11:17.011
Ah, can't be my parents.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.747
Dad's too sick.

11:19.780 --> 11:24.919
Mom couldn't handle pre-teen
hormones 25 years ago.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.388
This right here is the
result of that.

11:27.421 --> 11:31.025
So that's gonna fall
on my shoulders, the kid.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.997
- Can you handle that?
- No. No.

11:37.031 --> 11:38.832
I don't like humans.

11:38.866 --> 11:42.136
Much less ones under 18.
Now I gotta live with him.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.005
- But he's blood.
- To family, Max.

11:45.039 --> 11:48.442
He's blood.
And so I'll grind it out.

11:48.475 --> 11:53.214
- Max, the good uncle.
- The good Scotch.

11:53.247 --> 11:56.483
<i>Have you ever had like
the worst day of your life?</i>

11:56.518 --> 11:59.453
<i>I guarantee you, it isn't
as bad as the one I'm having.</i>

11:59.486 --> 12:02.056
<i>Me. I lost everything.</i>

12:02.089 --> 12:04.458
- <i>All at once.</i>
- Hey, Tim.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.995
Your long-lost Uncle Max.

12:09.363 --> 12:12.132
Remember me? Famous magician.

12:12.166 --> 12:15.970
I got all those television
car commercials.

12:16.003 --> 12:19.340
I sent you that autographed headshot
for your birthday last year.

12:19.373 --> 12:23.978
You remember that? Or was it...
Maybe it was two years ago.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.145
Uh...

12:26.548 --> 12:30.117
I guess we share
the same DNA, you know?

12:30.150 --> 12:32.353
So I'm gonna be the one
that has to take care of you.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.756
Not really qualified to be
a parent.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.894
Or a human being,
for that matter.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.864
I mean, I'm still trying to
figure out my own life.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.766
You know, what do I want?
Who am I?

12:47.301 --> 12:51.438
Working in a soul-sucking
dead-end job?

12:51.472 --> 12:53.874
I mean, I'm paycheck
to paycheck.

12:53.907 --> 12:56.277
Just scraping by.
No insurance.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.548
Oh, and my girlfriend just
broke up with me,

13:00.582 --> 13:02.783
after two and a half weeks.
You believe that?

13:05.052 --> 13:06.854
Said she'd rather date a clown.

13:08.623 --> 13:11.458
Hurts. It hurts, you know?

13:15.496 --> 13:19.266
Anyway, I feel a little
better now.

13:19.300 --> 13:23.103
Thanks for listening.
You feel better too?

13:27.107 --> 13:29.243
I've seen your magic on TV.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.045
Why can't you
bring back my parents?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.984
I'm sorry.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.586
There's only one guy
who knows that trick.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.923
You can forget about me living
with you.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.293
Tim. Oh... This is...
This is gonna really be great.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.297
Oh, honey.

13:50.331 --> 13:52.499
You say that I can't live in
my house

13:52.534 --> 13:55.035
because you have sell it to
the bank or whatever.

13:55.069 --> 13:57.639
So why can't I live with you?

13:57.672 --> 14:03.410
Oh, honey, your grandpa Lyle and I
would love to have you live with us.

14:03.444 --> 14:07.047
But he's not well now.

14:07.081 --> 14:09.517
Tim, Grandpa is going
to start on some medicine

14:09.551 --> 14:11.318
that's gonna make
him really sick.

14:11.352 --> 14:13.655
They can't do it.

14:13.688 --> 14:16.357
- Oh, I love you.
- I miss them.

14:21.663 --> 14:23.197
Now? Really?

14:28.068 --> 14:31.905
- This is not gonna work.
- Leave it to your mommy.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.942
She could talk the devil
into buying a Bible.

14:37.478 --> 14:42.550
Maybe you ought to give up this
cheap vaudeville stuff, huh?

14:42.584 --> 14:48.556
Get a real job, like your brother.
He had responsibility.

14:48.590 --> 14:50.658
Something you don't know
anything about.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.161
Oh...

15:07.441 --> 15:08.442
Hubba hubba.

15:10.678 --> 15:12.547
Too soon?

15:19.486 --> 15:20.588
All right.

15:24.659 --> 15:26.126
What do you think?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.363
I hate it.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.298
I hate wearing
that stupid thing.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.434
Nope. No. No.

15:33.467 --> 15:38.038
Look, let's just give this
a try, all right?

15:38.071 --> 15:39.707
Let me show you your room.

15:39.741 --> 15:44.011
Maybe you'll like it.
I doubt it, but maybe.

15:47.181 --> 15:48.716
Yep. Go down the hall.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.486
Nope. Left.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.995
Huh? What do you think?

16:03.397 --> 16:06.433
I mean, I know
it's a little plain but,

16:06.467 --> 16:08.335
that could work out
to your advantage, right?

16:08.368 --> 16:10.137
You can pick your
own curtains,

16:11.038 --> 16:12.507
pick your own bedspread.

16:12.540 --> 16:14.576
Put posters up.

16:14.609 --> 16:17.110
I used to have one
right over my bed. Every night...

16:19.547 --> 16:21.749
We'll keep 'em PG-13, though.
Okay?

16:23.350 --> 16:26.119
All right. I'm gonna
leave you to it.

16:26.153 --> 16:29.423
Lights out at 10:00. Don't try to
climb out the bedroom window, okay?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.258
My neighbor Vinnie has
a Rottweiler out there,

16:31.291 --> 16:33.327
and he roams the streets.

16:36.798 --> 16:38.031
This is so hard.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.569
You lost your dad.
I lost my brother.

16:41.603 --> 16:43.337
And now we're
just sort of stuck together.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.108
I gotta be honest.
I don't know what to do.

16:50.578 --> 16:52.680
What would your dad do
in a situation like this?

16:55.415 --> 16:58.318
He'd give me a hug and say
everything would be all right.

17:02.222 --> 17:08.095
Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah.
Let's do that. Come here.

17:08.127 --> 17:12.800
Bring it in.
There you go, Timmy.

17:12.834 --> 17:17.371
Just let those tears fly.
Everything's gonna be...

17:20.406 --> 17:22.242
Okay. Good night.

18:34.949 --> 18:37.184
Tim, I got some break...

18:48.930 --> 18:52.567
Teach that kid a learnin'.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.805
Figure out there's one
boss in this house.

18:59.874 --> 19:02.142
We'll see when Max attacks, man.

19:05.947 --> 19:07.481
Well played.

19:13.588 --> 19:14.756
I don't care.

19:33.641 --> 19:39.580
You don't get it in the first 50 takes
this time, I'm dubbing your voice.

19:39.614 --> 19:41.683
Did you know you had a gift
for encouragement?

19:43.584 --> 19:46.554
- How's your, um...
- Nephew?

19:46.587 --> 19:49.322
He's fine. Come on,
you've seen me with the kids.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.259
- They love me.
- Right.

19:52.292 --> 19:58.432
Isn't it illegal to leave a 10-year-old
kid alone by himself all day?

19:58.465 --> 20:02.737
I tied him to a chair until my next
door neighbor could come watch him.

20:02.770 --> 20:06.339
- How are the hemorrhoids?
- Quiet on the set.

20:08.810 --> 20:09.877
Are we ready?

20:10.878 --> 20:11.913
Roll it.

20:14.347 --> 20:20.588
Here at Magic Motors,
we make high prices disappear.

20:20.621 --> 20:22.255
Cut. Cut.

21:06.934 --> 21:09.771
Tim, I got you a burger, man.
Come get it.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.043
Dinner of champions, buddy.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.885
Uh-oh, how'd that happen?

21:23.918 --> 21:25.853
I guess we'll just have
to eat together, huh?

21:35.062 --> 21:38.833
Or not. Oh, cool.

21:46.841 --> 21:49.110
That kid is smart.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.471
You see anything you like?

22:18.506 --> 22:20.808
Some of these cars
are antiques.

22:22.109 --> 22:24.579
Well, that's a kinder way
of putting it.

22:24.612 --> 22:27.648
I'd like to buy
something from this century.

22:27.682 --> 22:31.719
Well, you know, they knock off
10 bucks for every dent you find.

22:31.752 --> 22:34.856
Oops.

22:36.891 --> 22:40.561
Do all of the salesmen
wear magician outfits?

22:42.429 --> 22:43.998
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.933
I'm not a salesman.

22:45.967 --> 22:48.135
I'm actually the
headliner here.

22:48.169 --> 22:52.673
Yeah, you know, the guy who does all
the charming television commercials,

22:52.707 --> 22:54.876
who everyone comes to see.

22:54.909 --> 22:59.479
But I'm really just biding my time
for the love of the kids. I love kids,

22:59.513 --> 23:02.717
and, uh, yeah,
cracking the code.

23:02.750 --> 23:05.152
Oh, and what code is that?

23:05.186 --> 23:07.822
The ultimate magic trick code.

23:07.855 --> 23:13.027
Think about it. Did anyone know David Copperfield
before he made the Statue of Liberty disappear?

23:13.060 --> 23:16.831
Before he levitated over the
Grand Canyon?

23:16.864 --> 23:19.567
Yeah, I think he was
pretty famous before that.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.204
Exactly. You know, I...

23:23.237 --> 23:25.573
I've been thinking
about a new trick.

23:27.508 --> 23:29.143
I could use a new,
lovely assistant.

23:30.645 --> 23:32.479
Now, that sounds like a line.

23:33.581 --> 23:36.183
Did it work?

23:36.217 --> 23:39.086
I have a job, but
thanks for the offer.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.755
We're ready for you,
Max.

23:40.788 --> 23:43.958
Oh, oh, oh.
They need me... the talent.

23:43.991 --> 23:48.529
Probably another close up.
Very little makeup, by the way.

23:48.562 --> 23:50.698
Anyway, you keep...
You keep trucking.

23:50.731 --> 23:52.033
Yeah, thank you.

23:52.066 --> 23:54.635
That's Frank "the Tank"
from <i>Old School.</i>

23:54.669 --> 23:56.971
- Yeah, ciao.
- Bye.

24:00.908 --> 24:04.145
See, you don't have
to do my dishes.

24:04.178 --> 24:06.446
- It's my pleasure, Max.
- Thank you.

24:08.182 --> 24:10.851
- How's Tim?
- Oh, he's fine.

24:10.885 --> 24:12.987
Mmm. He's a nice young man.

24:13.020 --> 24:15.589
- Yeah.
- Very quiet. But,

24:15.623 --> 24:18.659
then that's to be expected,
considering.

24:18.693 --> 24:21.762
Yeah, considering he was downgraded
to "Little Orphan" Timmy.

24:21.796 --> 24:24.899
I remember him as a loud voice
with a body.

24:24.932 --> 24:27.635
Now he's like
a closed clam in concrete.

24:27.668 --> 24:30.504
Give him time.
He's grieving, Max.

24:32.239 --> 24:35.176
Well, bills.

24:35.209 --> 24:38.846
I found out that his dad left me
$33,000 in his will,

24:38.879 --> 24:40.147
and he left the kids
some money in a trust.

24:40.181 --> 24:43.651
So it's not all bad news.
This is. Bill.

24:43.684 --> 24:46.120
- That was generous.
- Yeah. Yeah.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.956
I figure it...
It buys a little happiness.

24:48.990 --> 24:52.760
Max, you can't buy happiness.
Don't you know that?

24:52.793 --> 24:55.629
Yeah, I got the bad credit.

24:55.663 --> 24:57.832
Maybe I can lease it, right?

25:01.936 --> 25:03.104
What is this?

25:05.606 --> 25:09.310
Nice try, kid. You forget that
I'm a magician?

25:09.343 --> 25:12.113
I can spot a fake spider
miles away.

25:13.647 --> 25:17.852
Oh, fishing line.
That's pretty good.

25:22.223 --> 25:24.225
No.

25:26.694 --> 25:29.930
Get off me. Get off me.
Spiders, spiders, spiders.

25:33.067 --> 25:35.536
What's for breakfast?

25:36.704 --> 25:37.872
Cookies.

25:39.106 --> 25:40.274
Cookies.

25:47.681 --> 25:49.784
Lame trick.

25:49.817 --> 25:52.086
Cookies are not
a nutritious meal.

25:52.119 --> 25:55.089
Yeah, they are.
They really, really are.

25:55.122 --> 25:58.859
You crumble them up. You put 'em in a bowl.
You put a little milk in it.

25:58.893 --> 26:02.196
All right, we don't have milk.
Look at the bowl.

26:04.131 --> 26:06.033
I mean, that's what cereal is.

26:06.067 --> 26:07.768
It's... It's... cookies.

26:07.802 --> 26:10.304
What 10-year-old doesn't like
cookies for breakfast?

26:10.337 --> 26:12.673
One that wants to see 11.

26:15.676 --> 26:18.913
Mrs. C is gonna be here soon,
try not to kill her.

26:18.946 --> 26:20.648
Can we get a dog?

26:20.681 --> 26:22.917
It's supposed to
help with grief.

26:22.950 --> 26:26.921
Nice try. I'm still trying to
get the whole kid thing down.

26:26.954 --> 26:30.091
I mean, I gotta figure out.
Do you eat too much?

26:30.124 --> 26:34.061
- If you need shots.
- If I'm potty trained?

26:36.730 --> 26:38.032
- Are you?
- Yes. I know

26:38.065 --> 26:39.400
how to pee in a toilet.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.669
Look, can we just try to
get through this week?

26:41.702 --> 26:44.105
Then we can talk about adoption.
All right?

26:44.138 --> 26:45.806
Pet or person?

26:45.840 --> 26:48.342
Because I have no interest
in a sibling.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.811
- Especially a sister...
- Tim.

26:52.046 --> 26:53.981
- How tall are you?
- Why?

26:54.014 --> 26:56.417
What do you think about a magician
that can cut a kid in half.

26:56.450 --> 26:57.985
An illusion.

26:59.420 --> 27:02.389
Yeah, sure. An illusion. Okay.

27:02.423 --> 27:04.625
I think it's been done.

27:06.093 --> 27:08.162
You're right.

27:08.195 --> 27:10.397
Why don't you get
a good cavity started, huh?

27:10.431 --> 27:12.833
Try not to break anything.

27:12.867 --> 27:14.902
I'll be home after work.

27:17.805 --> 27:20.007
And here are the keys
to your new car.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.742
- Thank you.
- Now, when it breaks down...

27:21.775 --> 27:24.778
If it breaks down,
be sure to call us.

27:24.812 --> 27:26.780
- Will do.
- Enjoy.

27:26.814 --> 27:30.951
Oh, hello. Oh, you
bought one of our cars.

27:30.985 --> 27:32.887
Got a decent deal.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.822
Really?

27:34.855 --> 27:37.458
Well, you will be happy to know
that part of our policy here

27:37.491 --> 27:41.896
at Magic Motors is for
the charming magician...

27:41.929 --> 27:44.698
to provide lunch to all
of our new buyers.

27:44.732 --> 27:46.767
Except I don't do it
for everyone.

27:48.035 --> 27:51.872
- Uh, well, thanks anyway.
- Oh, oh, oh.

27:51.906 --> 27:54.441
I think I see
what's happening here.

27:54.475 --> 28:00.214
I think the life of a magician must
seem unattainable to the lay person.

28:00.247 --> 28:03.918
Glamorous, uh, well,
magical.

28:03.951 --> 28:07.721
But I assure you,
underneath this cape,

28:07.755 --> 28:09.924
I'm really just
a regular guy.

28:09.957 --> 28:12.326
- I'm sure you are.
- Yup.

28:12.359 --> 28:15.863
And I am really only in the
market for a car right now.

28:15.896 --> 28:19.033
I mean, do I have plenty
of other interests?

28:20.901 --> 28:25.439
Sure. Many goals and, well,
long-range plans.

28:25.472 --> 28:28.142
Like what?

28:28.175 --> 28:32.279
Like I said, there are so many.
How could I name just one.

28:35.482 --> 28:40.221
Surviving my nephew. Excuse me.

28:43.157 --> 28:44.959
- World peace.
- Really?

28:44.992 --> 28:46.727
- Yeah.
- Me, too.

28:49.897 --> 28:55.002
Well, congratulations on your new
car and I will see you for lunch.

28:55.035 --> 28:59.773
Impressive. I think the depth of
your character blew her mind.

28:59.807 --> 29:01.275
Shouldn't you be working?

29:01.308 --> 29:04.378
- I'm reading the paper.
- Really?

29:04.411 --> 29:06.413
When did you become
interested in world events?

29:06.447 --> 29:10.818
I'm not. I'm just checking the
obits, hoping to find your name,

29:15.122 --> 29:17.491
World peace?

29:17.525 --> 29:20.160
I couldn't think of a single
thing that I'm passionate about.

29:20.194 --> 29:22.162
Oh, come on.

29:22.196 --> 29:24.064
Have you ever seen anyone
choked to death?

29:24.098 --> 29:26.133
Like really choked to death,
even in the movies?

29:26.166 --> 29:28.869
Because that's what it was like.

29:28.902 --> 29:31.071
<i>So how's Tim?</i>

29:31.105 --> 29:33.274
<i>Makes Godzilla look
like a gecko.</i>

29:33.307 --> 29:34.808
<i>That bad?</i>

29:34.842 --> 29:36.977
<i>I think he's trying to
force my hand.</i>

29:37.011 --> 29:39.246
<i>I mean, he doesn't wanna
live with me. Who does?</i>

29:39.280 --> 29:41.382
<i>He probably
just feels alone.</i>

29:41.415 --> 29:45.019
<i>Amelia Earhart was alone.
Charles Lindbergh was alone.</i>

29:45.052 --> 29:48.389
<i>Those people that got stuck at the
top of Mount Olympus, they were alone.</i>

29:48.422 --> 29:51.325
- It's Everest.
- Exactly.

29:51.358 --> 29:54.461
<i>I'm getting hit in the face
by this parenthood like a brick.</i>

29:54.495 --> 29:58.533
<i>And I'm picking adolescent
shrapnel out of my body.</i>

29:58.566 --> 30:01.435
<i>Look, I'm gonna give him the
get-to-hate-me grace period,</i>

30:01.468 --> 30:04.104
<i>like I give everyone else
and, uh...</i>

30:05.439 --> 30:07.308
<i>I don't know,
throw some chores at him.</i>

30:08.976 --> 30:10.244
What's chores?

30:10.277 --> 30:12.379
The ones I don't wanna do.

30:28.929 --> 30:30.264
- Hi.
- First time here?

30:30.297 --> 30:32.199
Yeah, I just moved in
across the street.

30:32.232 --> 30:33.901
- Welcome to the town.
- Thank you.

30:33.934 --> 30:35.269
What can I get you?

30:35.302 --> 30:38.372
Um, can I get two scoops of
chocolate please?

30:38.405 --> 30:40.107
You got it.

30:41.241 --> 30:42.376
Is chocolate your favorite?

30:42.409 --> 30:45.045
Yeah. I like the
original flavors.

30:45.079 --> 30:47.948
I was gonna get vanilla
but I decided chocolate, so.

30:47.981 --> 30:49.283
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

30:53.921 --> 30:56.390
Oh, are you okay?

30:59.326 --> 31:01.862
- Here.
- Thanks.

31:02.963 --> 31:04.431
Can I buy
you another one?

31:04.465 --> 31:08.302
No, I think one of the scoops
got down my throat.

31:08.335 --> 31:12.039
I'm Brandi. You live at those
places near my house, right?

31:12.072 --> 31:14.174
Yeah. Tim.
I'd shake your hand,

31:14.208 --> 31:16.276
but you'd probably get
sticky handlebars.

31:16.310 --> 31:18.946
Thanks. I've got to go.

31:18.979 --> 31:21.081
But maybe I'll see you around.

31:21.115 --> 31:23.951
- Okay, cool.
- Bye.

31:41.402 --> 31:43.203
- Hello.
- What?

31:50.745 --> 31:56.350
I want to call a truce.
Okay, I surrender. Whatever it takes.

31:56.383 --> 32:01.021
You clearly have a future in espionage.

32:01.054 --> 32:03.223
You know, Tim, when I thought
about having a kid,

32:03.257 --> 32:05.325
I thought it would be a
baby crib and nursery rhymes,

32:05.359 --> 32:08.328
and I got an adult.

32:11.064 --> 32:12.567
I want you to have that.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.468
That's my very first magic hat.

32:14.501 --> 32:18.138
Be careful with that.
Actually lost my virginity...

32:21.108 --> 32:25.713
Tim, when a man
loves another...

32:25.747 --> 32:27.715
Okay, I know what
virginity is.

32:27.749 --> 32:30.217
- You do. Good.
- Sure, okay.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.586
Okay.

32:34.455 --> 32:37.391
- You like being a magician?
- I love it.

32:37.424 --> 32:39.193
You know I like
the best, though.

32:39.226 --> 32:41.361
The idea that I could maybe make
somebody's day

32:41.395 --> 32:43.565
a little less miserable
than mine.

32:43.598 --> 32:46.400
Not too difficult to do it,
I might add.

32:46.433 --> 32:48.068
I could teach you some
if you want.

32:48.101 --> 32:50.137
What are you going to
teach me first?

32:50.170 --> 32:52.640
How to put a snake
in a cookie jar?

32:52.674 --> 32:55.309
You know, Tim,
magic's a mindset.

32:55.342 --> 32:57.545
You start small
and you build it up,

32:57.579 --> 33:00.314
and then you're catching bullets
with your teeth.

33:00.347 --> 33:02.282
I'll teach you
everything I know.

33:02.316 --> 33:03.518
Except...

33:03.551 --> 33:06.220
my big signature trick.

33:06.253 --> 33:07.421
Why not that one?

33:07.454 --> 33:09.289
Tim, it's dangerous,

33:09.323 --> 33:10.558
even death-defying.

33:11.458 --> 33:13.193
Plus, if I told you,

33:13.227 --> 33:15.162
I would have to kill you.

33:15.195 --> 33:16.396
Not if I killed you first.

33:16.430 --> 33:19.066
You can't
'cause I'd disappear. Poof!

33:21.168 --> 33:23.437
My dad used to teach me stuff.

33:23.470 --> 33:24.506
I wish he was here.

33:25.640 --> 33:27.040
I do, too. I miss him.

33:29.476 --> 33:31.478
Anyway, tomorrow,

33:31.513 --> 33:32.814
we get magical.

33:32.847 --> 33:35.048
Give me it up high.
Down low.

33:35.082 --> 33:36.350
Too slow.

33:36.383 --> 33:38.820
Ooh, I'm out.
I'm safe though, right?

33:38.853 --> 33:40.320
- Sure.
- You sure?

33:40.354 --> 33:41.656
Yeah. You're good.

33:41.689 --> 33:43.056
- I hope so.
- Watch out for the spiders!

33:43.090 --> 33:45.225
- Oh!
- Nah, I'm kidding.

34:01.709 --> 34:03.210
Cups.

34:03.243 --> 34:04.244
Put the ball in...

34:17.157 --> 34:18.158
- Woah!
- <i>Voila!</i>

34:22.764 --> 34:24.498
I did it!

34:29.737 --> 34:30.737
Cool.

34:49.222 --> 34:50.257
Hey!

34:51.190 --> 34:52.492
Getting some ice cream?

34:52.527 --> 34:53.860
Not today.

34:53.895 --> 34:55.462
Sunflower seeds are safer.

34:55.495 --> 34:57.832
Probably not as sticky either.

34:57.865 --> 34:59.099
- Want some?
- Sure.

35:02.537 --> 35:03.871
Clifford?

35:05.740 --> 35:06.774
Yeah.

35:09.343 --> 35:10.410
Ew.

35:10.444 --> 35:11.846
So where do you live?

35:11.879 --> 35:12.880
Right down the street.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.284
I'm staying with my uncle.

35:17.317 --> 35:18.385
Parents on vacation?

35:19.486 --> 35:20.722
No,

35:20.755 --> 35:21.789
they died.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.593
My daddy died in the war.

35:32.533 --> 35:33.935
Ew.

35:33.968 --> 35:35.870
You're not supposed
to eat the shell.

35:35.903 --> 35:37.337
Why?

35:37.371 --> 35:39.172
So you have to crack the shell,

35:39.206 --> 35:40.842
and then you spit out the shell,

35:40.875 --> 35:42.610
and then you eat
the stuff inside.

35:42.644 --> 35:43.678
That's gross.

35:43.711 --> 35:44.712
No, try it.

35:46.313 --> 35:48.181
Okay, here goes.

35:53.521 --> 35:54.722
It takes some practice.

35:54.756 --> 35:57.190
Got a whole bag. Keep trying.

35:57.224 --> 35:59.627
My mom would love
seeing me do this.

35:59.661 --> 36:00.862
You wanna see a magic trick?

36:01.696 --> 36:02.697
Sure.

36:08.903 --> 36:11.506
- Red and blue, right?
- Uh-huh.

36:11.539 --> 36:14.742
Now, it's yellow and green.

36:14.776 --> 36:15.777
Whoa.

36:16.811 --> 36:18.680
- Wanna try?
- Sure.

36:18.713 --> 36:19.947
Nope.

36:19.981 --> 36:22.215
A magician
never reveals his secrets.

36:26.854 --> 36:28.288
This is so cute.

36:28.321 --> 36:30.892
I'd like to buy it.
How much is it?

36:30.925 --> 36:32.292
$5.

36:38.533 --> 36:40.200
I think this is five.

36:42.570 --> 36:45.305
One, two,
three, it's five.

36:45.338 --> 36:46.473
Well, thank you so much.

36:46.507 --> 36:47.842
You're welcome. Enjoy Bonita.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.409
Thank you. I will.

36:51.612 --> 36:52.847
Hello.

36:52.880 --> 36:54.247
Hello.

36:54.281 --> 36:56.584
- Just that.
- You look familiar.

36:57.985 --> 36:59.654
Wait a minute. You do, too.

36:59.687 --> 37:01.589
You bought one of our
freshly-impounded used cars.

37:02.824 --> 37:04.357
Jen-ni-fer.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.561
Oh, that's such a...
That's a beautiful name.

37:07.628 --> 37:08.863
And you're that, uh,

37:08.896 --> 37:10.631
Merlin, the magician guy.

37:10.665 --> 37:12.934
Max "the Magical."

37:12.967 --> 37:15.603
At your service, my lady.
It's catchy, isn't it?

37:15.636 --> 37:17.337
Merlin is the guy
with the beard.

37:17.370 --> 37:18.806
Old guy, not like me.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.675
And he helps the kid
with the sword.

37:20.708 --> 37:21.776
It's a good movie.

37:21.809 --> 37:25.345
So where is your magic outfit?

37:25.378 --> 37:26.881
It's at the cleaners.

37:26.914 --> 37:29.316
It's tough getting all
that fairy dust off, you know.

37:29.349 --> 37:30.785
Plus, a little baby
throw-up, too.

37:30.818 --> 37:32.754
Listen, I know this timing
is maybe a little weird...

37:32.787 --> 37:33.788
$49.95.

37:36.557 --> 37:38.726
You know what?
I actually have this.

37:38.760 --> 37:40.393
That's embarrassing.

37:40.427 --> 37:44.331
Um, I will just get
this beautiful little heart.

37:45.700 --> 37:47.001
$10. Cash or credit?

37:48.569 --> 37:50.037
I love the way you say that.

37:50.071 --> 37:51.506
"Cash or credit."

37:53.074 --> 37:55.977
Cash, 'cause I have
plenty of cash.

37:56.010 --> 37:57.745
Cash has not been
a problem for me,

37:57.779 --> 37:59.514
if you know what I mean.

37:59.547 --> 38:01.682
Do you wanna buy Park Place
or Boardwalk?

38:03.885 --> 38:06.954
Remnants from a series
of pranks with my nephew.

38:06.988 --> 38:08.556
We called a truce.

38:08.589 --> 38:10.658
Actually, I surrendered.

38:10.691 --> 38:12.593
Um, it's a long story.

38:13.861 --> 38:15.696
We all have stories, don't we?

38:16.764 --> 38:17.999
$10 for the heart.

38:21.736 --> 38:22.970
Ten and one.

38:23.771 --> 38:25.606
That's for you.

38:25.640 --> 38:26.741
Here's your heart.

38:28.643 --> 38:29.677
Thank you.

38:30.945 --> 38:31.979
I'll go.

38:37.552 --> 38:38.786
Bye...

38:46.727 --> 38:48.896
That's four times
through the line in a half hour.

38:48.930 --> 38:50.832
I know. I love it.

38:50.865 --> 38:52.700
I think it's my new hobby.

38:52.733 --> 38:54.869
Your quest
will be fruitless, you know.

38:55.503 --> 38:56.537
Mmm.

38:56.571 --> 38:57.972
I believe in Cinderella stories.

38:58.005 --> 38:59.607
I believe in tragedies.

38:59.640 --> 39:00.975
Hmm.

39:01.008 --> 39:02.610
That's really funny.

39:03.511 --> 39:04.846
$3.50.

39:04.879 --> 39:07.515
Oh, yeah. You know what?

39:07.548 --> 39:10.084
I know how stores
always need change.

39:10.117 --> 39:11.752
It's funny
they never have change.

39:13.888 --> 39:15.590
So that's why
I'm paying in change,

39:15.623 --> 39:17.925
not because I don't have
money or anything like that.

39:17.959 --> 39:20.528
But I brought you some...
Some quarters.

39:20.561 --> 39:21.963
Quarters are important.

39:21.996 --> 39:24.065
One, two...

39:24.098 --> 39:26.767
Three... Let me take you
away from this.

39:26.801 --> 39:28.669
You know what?
That's good enough.

39:28.703 --> 39:29.837
Just take the bird.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.643
Thank you, from me, too.

39:35.676 --> 39:36.944
You should see me in my cape.

39:38.145 --> 39:39.547
I did.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.184
- Oh, sorry.
- You scared the hell out of me.

40:17.218 --> 40:19.587
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I hurt my whole leg.

40:19.620 --> 40:22.023
Oh, hi. How are you?

40:22.056 --> 40:24.191
Funny meeting you here.

40:24.225 --> 40:26.861
Okay, look,
you seem like a nice guy.

40:26.894 --> 40:28.629
Thanks. I am. I'm really nice.

40:28.663 --> 40:30.998
Okay. I just got into town.
I've got responsibilities.

40:31.032 --> 40:33.868
Meeting a man at this point
is not a priority.

40:33.901 --> 40:37.004
Oh, well, how far down the list
do you think it is?

40:37.038 --> 40:38.739
It's about where your shoes are.

40:41.575 --> 40:44.512
- So you're saying there's a chance?
- Okay, I'm just keeping it real.

40:44.545 --> 40:45.980
- That's from <i>Dumb and Dumber.</i>
- I know.

40:46.013 --> 40:48.849
You do?
See, we have this in common.

40:48.883 --> 40:51.585
Um, okay. You know what?
You know what?

40:51.619 --> 40:53.187
Catch me
on one of my TV commercials.

40:53.220 --> 40:55.156
Aren't your TV commercials
late at night?

40:56.190 --> 40:57.825
Yeah.

40:57.858 --> 41:00.561
Technically,
the next morning. So?

41:00.594 --> 41:02.229
You hurt my feelings.

41:04.031 --> 41:05.733
I will look for it.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.969
I'm gonna send you
a secret signal,

41:08.002 --> 41:10.171
<i>Monopoly</i> money.
I'm gonna wave it out.

41:10.204 --> 41:11.772
I'm just gonna walk around you.

41:11.806 --> 41:13.908
- This is our thing anyway right?
- Yep.

41:13.941 --> 41:17.545
Oh, that was... That was magic.

41:25.953 --> 41:29.824
Max. Did Tim tell you
about his new friend?

41:29.857 --> 41:31.258
No. Big deal, Mrs. C.

41:32.126 --> 41:33.995
It's a girl.

41:35.963 --> 41:38.532
Facts of life
are in play already, huh?

41:39.800 --> 41:42.036
All right, come on. Let's go.

41:43.304 --> 41:45.639
Little man talk, Mrs. C.
Let's go.

41:45.673 --> 41:46.941
Okay. I got it.

41:53.981 --> 41:55.649
This is gonna be awkward. Okay?

41:56.751 --> 41:57.918
Hit me.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.957
- What's your secret?
- Secret?

42:02.990 --> 42:05.192
With the babes, man.

42:05.226 --> 42:07.328
You're getting everywhere.
I'm getting nowhere.

42:07.361 --> 42:09.563
There is no secret.

42:09.597 --> 42:12.166
I just let it happen naturally.

42:12.199 --> 42:15.336
Okay, I see
what's happening here.

42:15.369 --> 42:18.139
You want to see old Uncle Max
burn up on reentry.

42:19.940 --> 42:21.642
You know what?

42:21.675 --> 42:23.944
I'll tell you my secret

42:23.978 --> 42:27.715
if you tell me your big trick.

42:27.748 --> 42:29.884
A magician never reveals
his tricks.

42:31.252 --> 42:33.254
Okay, good luck with the babes.

42:37.291 --> 42:40.294
Hmm. Good talk?

42:40.327 --> 42:42.263
He still has a lot to learn.

42:54.375 --> 42:57.378
<i>I've sent a few items
gathered from your past.</i>

42:57.411 --> 42:58.846
<i>I knew I never gave you</i>

42:58.879 --> 43:01.315
<i>all the father-son talks
you deserve.</i>

43:01.348 --> 43:04.652
<i>I was never a hug
and kissy type of father.</i>

43:04.685 --> 43:08.055
<i>You had many more coming
than I ever gave you.</i>

43:08.089 --> 43:12.093
<i>You never let me down.
You always tried your hardest.</i>

43:12.126 --> 43:14.895
<i>And when we argued,
you were mostly right.</i>

43:14.929 --> 43:17.865
<i>But I couldn't bend
in my thinking.</i>

43:17.898 --> 43:19.700
<i>Life is so short, as they say,</i>

43:19.733 --> 43:24.038
<i>so make your years with Tim
heartfelt and full of joy.</i>

43:24.071 --> 43:27.141
<i>Always here for you. Love, Dad.</i>

43:27.174 --> 43:28.175
What's that?

43:29.877 --> 43:32.980
My, uh, my dad sent this.

43:33.013 --> 43:34.782
It's all stuff
from when I was a kid.

43:44.291 --> 43:46.894
Broke my nose trying to catch
my first grounder.

43:49.096 --> 43:51.031
Nice catch. Oh...

43:51.765 --> 43:53.701
Here.

43:53.734 --> 43:56.303
Your first hand-me-down.

43:56.337 --> 43:58.973
Be careful with that thing.
You could poke an eye out.

44:00.307 --> 44:02.243
Or mine.

44:02.276 --> 44:05.212
Maybe I should use it
on this boy named Clifford.

44:07.481 --> 44:08.916
He's got it out for me.

44:11.719 --> 44:13.754
I noticed the scratches
once in a while.

44:13.787 --> 44:14.788
Clifford? Huh?

44:16.190 --> 44:18.159
- Cliff-ford?
- Mmm-hmm.

44:18.192 --> 44:19.827
Clifford.

44:19.860 --> 44:22.096
I'd be a bully
if my name was Cli-fford.

44:23.831 --> 44:25.399
So what's his racket?

44:25.432 --> 44:28.269
- Takes lunch money, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

44:28.302 --> 44:31.305
That and he makes people
pay for protection...

44:31.338 --> 44:32.840
from himself.

44:32.873 --> 44:36.010
He calls it life insurance.

44:36.043 --> 44:39.079
Word is, he has 500 bucks
in his backpack.

44:39.113 --> 44:42.816
- What?
- I say it's like closer to 150.

44:45.219 --> 44:47.354
Not too sure
what I'm supposed to say here.

44:47.388 --> 44:49.190
I think I should say,

44:49.223 --> 44:52.126
"Don't ever take that slingshot
to school for any reason."

44:53.460 --> 44:56.063
- Hmm?
- Okay.

44:56.096 --> 44:59.233
You gotta settle it
with your fists. <i>Capisce?</i>

44:59.266 --> 45:01.068
- Really?
- You give him a one-way ticket

45:01.101 --> 45:04.071
to knuckle airlines,
uppercut. Uppercut.

45:04.104 --> 45:06.774
- Seriously?
- Let me see what you got.

45:06.807 --> 45:09.210
Yeah, that's it. You kick butt.

45:09.243 --> 45:12.514
- Name names.
- Yeah, yeah.

45:12.547 --> 45:14.516
Yeah. That hurts, okay.

45:14.549 --> 45:16.417
You walk away.

45:16.450 --> 45:18.986
You know,
bullies are just bullies

45:19.019 --> 45:20.821
because they're scared.

45:20.854 --> 45:24.325
They don't want anyone to know
so they put on this big act.

45:24.358 --> 45:28.195
You stand up to him,
you got no problems.

45:28.229 --> 45:29.897
I never thought about it
that way.

45:31.533 --> 45:34.935
Well, this time, you should.

45:40.407 --> 45:41.909
I can't hit a thing.

45:41.942 --> 45:44.111
- Can I try?
- Sure.

45:44.144 --> 45:45.145
Hey.

45:48.048 --> 45:49.049
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

45:52.386 --> 45:54.188
How did you do that?

45:54.221 --> 45:55.724
Just did it.

45:58.560 --> 46:00.494
So, have you cried yet?

46:01.195 --> 46:02.363
No.

46:04.465 --> 46:05.799
I cry every day.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.068
Especially at night.

46:10.371 --> 46:11.539
Leaving already?

46:14.408 --> 46:16.277
I hear my mom cry at night.

46:18.145 --> 46:19.947
Crying is good.

46:19.980 --> 46:22.416
I wish I could talk
to my mom and dad.

46:22.449 --> 46:23.585
You can.

46:23.618 --> 46:25.252
Visit them at their grave site.

46:26.287 --> 46:27.421
It helped me.

46:29.056 --> 46:31.125
I gotta go. See you around.

46:34.862 --> 46:35.863
See you later.

46:50.944 --> 46:53.914
So, yeah, I just waited for her
outside her store,

46:53.947 --> 46:56.483
you know, suave and stuff.

46:56.518 --> 46:58.252
So you... You're stalking her.

46:59.386 --> 47:01.121
Stalking,

47:01.155 --> 47:02.956
staking, staking out.

47:02.990 --> 47:05.392
So?

47:05.426 --> 47:07.194
The Berlin Wall went up again.

47:08.962 --> 47:10.565
So, break it down again.

47:12.066 --> 47:14.902
It might take
another hundred years.

47:14.935 --> 47:16.270
Definitely would be worth it,
though.

47:22.176 --> 47:23.844
Yeah. Hi, Mrs. C.

47:25.112 --> 47:26.980
What?

47:28.916 --> 47:31.653
Unbelievable.

47:31.686 --> 47:35.989
Yeah. No. Lock him in the closet
with no food or water.

47:36.023 --> 47:37.491
I'll be there as soon as I can.

47:39.326 --> 47:40.361
What happened?

47:41.228 --> 47:43.130
Timmy, the kid,

47:43.163 --> 47:45.966
broke a car window
with a slingshot.

47:45.999 --> 47:47.535
Who gave him that?

47:47.569 --> 47:49.537
Someone who should
definitely not

47:49.571 --> 47:52.039
have responsibility
over young children.

48:03.484 --> 48:04.485
Whoa!

48:05.986 --> 48:07.689
- Max.
- Hi.

48:07.722 --> 48:10.190
- Tim left.
- What?

48:10.224 --> 48:12.459
Vinnie, open up!

48:13.628 --> 48:15.095
I didn't call the cops.

48:15.129 --> 48:16.463
Vinnie, I don't have time
for your games.

48:16.497 --> 48:18.399
My nephew, Tim, took off.
Which way did he go?

48:26.140 --> 48:27.207
You're really high up.

48:28.475 --> 48:30.043
Sorry about the window.

48:31.378 --> 48:33.347
It's all right.
The wind made it curve.

48:35.249 --> 48:36.551
Are you gonna punish me?

48:37.217 --> 48:38.252
Nah.

48:39.153 --> 48:40.655
That is nah,

48:40.688 --> 48:42.489
as long as you tell me
your secret.

48:45.292 --> 48:46.927
All right, I'll go first.

48:49.096 --> 48:50.464
My secret is...

48:51.699 --> 48:53.967
I don't have
a big signature trick.

48:55.002 --> 48:56.970
I never have.

48:57.004 --> 48:59.473
That's why I work
a nowhere job for peanuts.

49:00.675 --> 49:02.376
I lack inspiration.

49:03.343 --> 49:05.345
I like your magic tricks.

49:05.379 --> 49:08.550
Yeah, well, thanks.
'Cause you're a rare breed.

49:08.583 --> 49:10.585
All right, that's my secret.
You're up.

49:11.519 --> 49:13.187
My secret?

49:13.220 --> 49:15.590
Yeah, come on.
I just spilled my guts out.

49:17.291 --> 49:20.294
The secret is to be yourself.

49:20.327 --> 49:21.729
That's what I do.

49:21.763 --> 49:24.164
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on. This is serious.

49:24.198 --> 49:26.400
Listen, I met
this total babe, and...

49:26.433 --> 49:28.168
I mean lady.

49:28.202 --> 49:30.137
And every time I get around her,

49:30.170 --> 49:32.473
I say stupid things,
I do stupid things,

49:32.507 --> 49:34.374
I get real nervous.

49:34.408 --> 49:35.743
For the first time...

49:37.244 --> 49:38.245
ever.

49:39.279 --> 49:40.715
I need help, man!

49:41.616 --> 49:43.116
Come on, spill it.

49:43.150 --> 49:46.220
Like, how did your dad
get your mom?

49:46.253 --> 49:49.189
How am I supposed to know?
I wasn't even born.

49:49.223 --> 49:50.625
Yeah. Good point.

49:50.658 --> 49:52.527
Well, just take a guess.

49:54.328 --> 49:55.697
She always liked compliments.

49:56.664 --> 49:58.265
Ah, yeah.

49:58.298 --> 50:00.033
Jennifer, you're so hot.

50:00.067 --> 50:02.236
No more specific.

50:02.269 --> 50:03.470
Like...

50:03.505 --> 50:05.305
Your hair smells delicious.

50:06.406 --> 50:08.810
Or... I like your boobies.

50:08.843 --> 50:11.713
No, come on.

50:11.746 --> 50:14.281
Like, your eyes are beautiful.

50:14.314 --> 50:16.651
Oh, yeah, yeah. Eyes are good.

50:18.252 --> 50:20.655
She also liked thoughtful gifts.

50:20.688 --> 50:22.790
Oh, yeah.
I could get her like a...

50:22.824 --> 50:25.392
a gift certificate
to the movies.

50:25.425 --> 50:27.629
Come on. More thoughtful.

50:27.662 --> 50:31.298
Like, if it's the first thing
that comes to mind...

50:31.331 --> 50:33.200
Yeah. Then it's not
that thoughtful.

50:33.233 --> 50:34.234
No.

50:35.369 --> 50:36.804
Good talk. Good talk.

50:38.171 --> 50:39.172
I'm falling.

50:44.444 --> 50:46.213
I, Max

50:46.246 --> 50:47.582
"the Magical,"

50:47.615 --> 50:50.685
shall levitate that cup
into that can.

50:50.718 --> 50:53.655
- Do you believe I can do it?
- No.

50:53.688 --> 50:56.290
You wanna put your money
where your 10-year-old mouth is?

50:56.323 --> 50:59.059
- Quarter says I can.
- Bet you a dollar you can't.

51:00.628 --> 51:03.096
Dollar's pretty steep.
Okay, you better pay up.

51:04.832 --> 51:07.535
Please, I need complete silence.

51:09.604 --> 51:11.606
I am conjuring
my personal force.

51:16.778 --> 51:18.513
Yes!

51:18.546 --> 51:20.314
- You see it? It moved.
- No.

51:20.347 --> 51:22.784
- That was the wind.
- Wind-schmind. That was me.

51:22.817 --> 51:25.285
That was Max "the Magical."
Watch.

51:25.319 --> 51:26.521
Watch and learn.

51:34.862 --> 51:36.531
Can I pay you next week?

51:36.564 --> 51:38.633
No, no. The reason is
I gotta call my accountant,

51:38.666 --> 51:42.870
move some things around, offshore
accountants. It's for tax purposes.

51:42.904 --> 51:44.104
Yeah, right.

51:45.740 --> 51:47.842
Did you make mistakes
when you were a kid?

51:47.875 --> 51:50.243
Tons.

51:50.277 --> 51:53.113
I did so much stupid stuff,
my dad was so fed up with me.

51:53.681 --> 51:54.716
Wait.

51:59.186 --> 52:00.220
I think I just...

52:02.389 --> 52:05.192
Yeah, I just got an idea
for a new trick.

52:05.225 --> 52:06.928
- The big one?
- Could be.

52:06.961 --> 52:08.563
Could be.
But I'll tell you what.

52:08.596 --> 52:10.932
It's gonna take
a little humility

52:10.965 --> 52:12.900
and a lot of embarrassment.

52:12.934 --> 52:14.569
So, do it.

52:14.602 --> 52:17.805
Not for me, for you.

52:17.839 --> 52:20.575
- I look ridiculous.
- You do not.

52:20.608 --> 52:23.578
You look great. You said
you wanted to be my assistant.

52:23.611 --> 52:25.713
Man, I hope no one sees me.

52:25.747 --> 52:28.448
Everybody's gonna see you.
And we're gonna see...

52:31.251 --> 52:33.554
Yeah, hold on. Just don't move.

52:36.490 --> 52:38.693
- Pull the thing. Pull...
- Give me that.

52:38.726 --> 52:41.929
How many times have I told you?
Don't play with my magic stuff.

52:41.963 --> 52:44.866
- His fault.
- I'm sorry.

52:44.899 --> 52:47.367
Now, if you want me to show you
how to do it, I will.

52:48.402 --> 52:50.337
But not now, because I'm mad.

52:50.370 --> 52:53.206
Oh, but listen, I was thinking
about this other trick

52:53.240 --> 52:57.344
when I levitate,
and then I come back down

52:58.278 --> 52:59.514
and then...

52:59.547 --> 53:01.683
You don't know how to levitate.

53:01.716 --> 53:02.784
I know how to levitate.

53:04.686 --> 53:05.920
Hold this.

53:06.888 --> 53:09.624
Hey! Get off! Get off him!

53:09.657 --> 53:10.892
Stand right there!

53:10.925 --> 53:12.325
What the heck is going on?

53:12.359 --> 53:13.728
I leave you alone
for two seconds

53:13.761 --> 53:14.962
and you get into a fight?

53:14.996 --> 53:16.964
Self-defense.
Clifford started it.

53:16.998 --> 53:19.399
- He had it coming.
- Hey.

53:19.433 --> 53:21.836
You beat it before I make you
pay for the hat.

53:21.869 --> 53:23.971
Whatever.
I'll teach you later, Tim.

53:24.005 --> 53:25.673
Listen, you're not...

53:28.576 --> 53:30.477
- I'm not doing this anymore.
- No. Hold on.

53:30.511 --> 53:32.345
Hold on, the outfit.
Don't do that.

53:32.379 --> 53:34.549
The outfit's paid for, buddy.

53:34.582 --> 53:36.884
- What about the big reveal?
- Do it yourself.

53:38.786 --> 53:40.588
Tim.

53:40.621 --> 53:42.289
We were gonna be...

53:42.322 --> 53:44.491
Go to Mrs. C's, Tim.

54:39.881 --> 54:42.650
<i>Mom, Dad,</i>

54:42.683 --> 54:45.787
<i>I know you're in heaven
and I'm gonna have to wait,</i>

54:45.820 --> 54:48.956
<i>but I think I know
what you told me.</i>

54:50.024 --> 54:52.459
<i>This is my life now.</i>

54:52.492 --> 54:54.028
<i>I should make
the best of it, huh?</i>

54:58.599 --> 54:59.600
I miss them.

55:01.903 --> 55:03.470
I miss them, too.

55:11.512 --> 55:12.847
I'm a failure, Jim.

55:14.849 --> 55:17.450
I'm warping this kid's
young, fragile mind.

55:20.087 --> 55:22.890
Oh, phones!

55:28.963 --> 55:29.997
Hi, Mrs. C.

55:31.699 --> 55:33.000
Yeah, I know.

55:33.034 --> 55:35.536
Sidekick thing
was a bad idea. I...

55:38.105 --> 55:40.007
Tim just got home?

55:40.041 --> 55:41.509
What do you mean he just...

55:41.542 --> 55:43.476
It's 10:00.
Where the hell was he?

55:45.513 --> 55:47.748
Brandi?

55:47.782 --> 55:49.517
He was with Brandi.

55:50.785 --> 55:52.086
That little player.

55:53.087 --> 55:54.555
Her mom's there.

55:55.122 --> 55:56.958
She's mad.

55:56.991 --> 55:58.358
Extremely mad.

56:00.427 --> 56:02.429
Not at me, though, right?

56:02.462 --> 56:03.698
No, no, no.

56:03.731 --> 56:06.033
Okay, I'll be right there.

56:06.067 --> 56:07.735
Sorry I'm late. Mrs. C.

56:09.003 --> 56:10.638
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

56:10.671 --> 56:11.873
You two know each other?

56:11.906 --> 56:14.775
- Yeah, we met.
- Briefly.

56:14.809 --> 56:16.878
I think I hear laundry
calling my name.

56:16.911 --> 56:18.946
Why don't you two go watch TV
for a few minutes?

56:22.183 --> 56:24.785
- I wanna go with them.
- You, stay.

56:27.154 --> 56:28.689
I was worried sick.

56:28.723 --> 56:30.191
Two 10-year-old's
have no business

56:30.224 --> 56:32.193
roaming the streets
at night. We have rules.

56:32.226 --> 56:34.095
You're darn right we do.

56:34.128 --> 56:36.030
Now what are we gonna do
about her?

56:36.063 --> 56:38.599
Oh, she's in trouble, too.

56:38.633 --> 56:41.102
Ever since Brandi's been hanging
around with your nephew,

56:41.135 --> 56:43.738
I am slipping on sunflower
shells all over the house.

56:43.771 --> 56:45.806
Oh, no.

56:47.808 --> 56:52.146
They're kids,
they bond in different ways.

56:52.179 --> 56:54.481
Mrs. Chambers told me
about your brother.

56:55.516 --> 56:57.184
I am sorry.

56:57.218 --> 56:59.153
It's not easy. We can relate.

56:59.186 --> 57:01.756
And, Tim,
he seems like a great kid.

57:01.789 --> 57:03.490
But keep him away
from your daughter.

57:03.524 --> 57:05.159
No, I don't want that.

57:05.192 --> 57:07.762
It's not fair of me
to take that away.

57:07.795 --> 57:11.165
But I cannot be at work
wondering if Brandi is safe.

57:11.198 --> 57:13.200
Mrs. C could watch them.

57:13.234 --> 57:16.070
And then you could swing by
to pick them up.

57:16.103 --> 57:17.805
I'm thinking six-ish.

57:19.006 --> 57:21.042
So you guarantee her safety?

57:24.946 --> 57:27.548
Mmm. I'm gonna
have to ask you for a favor.

57:30.084 --> 57:31.919
<i>Godfather.</i>

57:31.953 --> 57:35.022
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm doing.

57:35.056 --> 57:36.691
This is new to me, you know?

57:36.724 --> 57:40.194
Yeah, I'm guessing it's not easy
being an instant parent.

57:40.227 --> 57:41.862
Parenthood was microwaved

57:41.896 --> 57:44.065
and then thrown into my life
like a frozen TV dinner.

57:44.098 --> 57:45.700
But I don't have the directions,

57:45.733 --> 57:47.101
so I don't know
which part to put the slit in

57:47.134 --> 57:48.669
or which part to peel back.

57:48.703 --> 57:50.504
And so I end up with
overdone peach cobbler

57:50.538 --> 57:52.239
and frozen chimichangas.

57:52.273 --> 57:55.609
It is not easy.
I will give you that.

57:55.643 --> 57:57.078
Well, thank you.

57:57.111 --> 57:59.246
B, we gotta go, missy.

57:59.280 --> 58:01.515
One second, Mom.

58:01.549 --> 58:06.954
So how does one globally warm
your attitude towards them?

58:06.988 --> 58:09.223
You could keep my kid safe,
for starters.

58:09.256 --> 58:10.958
- I can do that.
- Good.

58:11.826 --> 58:12.893
Good.

58:14.195 --> 58:16.664
You know, actually, um...

58:16.697 --> 58:18.299
- there is one thing.
- Yes.

58:18.332 --> 58:20.634
No, I just never gave up hope.

58:22.136 --> 58:23.671
What?

58:23.704 --> 58:25.973
Um, it's Brandi's 11th birthday
on Friday.

58:26.007 --> 58:27.975
Maybe it would be cool
if you and Tim

58:28.009 --> 58:30.678
could swing by around dinner
and surprise her.

58:30.711 --> 58:33.647
Surp... Surprise.

58:33.681 --> 58:35.750
- We'll come.
- Good.

58:35.783 --> 58:38.719
- Good.
- I'll have cake and food.

58:38.753 --> 58:40.755
Cake is good.

58:43.758 --> 58:46.927
She doesn't know anyone,
so it is kind of a big deal.

58:46.961 --> 58:49.730
You don't have to get her anything.
Just yourselves is enough.

58:49.764 --> 58:52.066
No, no, no, no, no.
We're gonna get her something.

58:52.099 --> 58:54.702
I mean,
not too extravagant, but...

58:54.735 --> 58:57.605
And then maybe
a little magic on the side.

58:58.806 --> 59:00.975
- You see what I did there?
- Yes.

59:01.008 --> 59:02.877
- It's innuendo.
- It's great.

59:02.910 --> 59:05.112
- Thank you.
- So Tim knows where we live.

59:05.146 --> 59:07.148
It's just
down the street, 1167.

59:07.181 --> 59:09.717
1167, 1167.

59:09.750 --> 59:12.186
- Okay, then. See you later.
- 1167, 1167.

59:12.953 --> 59:15.089
1167. Not you.

59:28.369 --> 59:31.205
Max, this is Chubby the Clown.

59:31.238 --> 59:33.040
Chubby is gonna be helping us
out here.

59:33.074 --> 59:35.643
He'll be getting the laughs
and you do the magic.

59:38.312 --> 59:40.147
No way, Grismer.

59:40.181 --> 59:41.682
This is my turf.

59:41.715 --> 59:43.984
I've worked this gig
hard for years.

59:46.887 --> 59:48.656
I'm the headliner here, Grismer.

59:48.689 --> 59:50.658
We need some new blood.

59:50.691 --> 59:52.193
So you brought a clown?

59:52.226 --> 59:54.095
People love clowns.

59:54.128 --> 59:57.331
Oh.

59:59.767 --> 01:00:03.003
If I had a dollar for every time
you threatened to switch to...

01:00:03.037 --> 01:00:05.906
If I had a dollar
for every dollar I've lost

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.276
because of your bad attitude
and stale tricks,

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.345
I wouldn't need a clown.

01:00:11.378 --> 01:00:14.982
Don't even try it.
I make compliments rain.

01:00:15.015 --> 01:00:16.717
Yeah, that's all pity.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.018
Pity, nothing.

01:00:18.052 --> 01:00:20.221
If it weren't for me being
so damn charming

01:00:20.254 --> 01:00:23.224
with my damn charming
television commercials,

01:00:23.257 --> 01:00:25.192
you wouldn't sell a thing.

01:00:25.226 --> 01:00:27.294
Well, we'll just
have to see about that.

01:00:31.198 --> 01:00:33.434
I'm thinking of a new act.

01:00:33.467 --> 01:00:36.337
It's not your act, Max,
it's you.

01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:37.872
You're fired.

01:00:38.405 --> 01:00:39.807
I quit!

01:00:41.342 --> 01:00:43.377
Oh!

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:46.213
Whoo! It's raining,
it's raining!

01:00:46.247 --> 01:00:50.017
You're not only a bad magician,
you're a bad person.

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:51.452
Oh, yeah?

01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:53.287
Oh, yeah!

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:56.157
You think I'm a bad person, huh?

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.660
You, think
I'm a bad person, huh? Huh?

01:01:02.129 --> 01:01:04.798
I'm a great person. Yeah.

01:01:04.832 --> 01:01:06.734
I'm a...

01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:08.335
I'm America's sweetheart.

01:01:08.369 --> 01:01:10.337
I'm a national
frigging treasure.

01:01:10.371 --> 01:01:11.972
I'm the Julia Roberts

01:01:12.006 --> 01:01:15.743
of used car sales, baby.
Rain it down.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.916
I'm a good person.

01:01:21.949 --> 01:01:24.118
There goes
employee of the month.

01:01:24.151 --> 01:01:25.853
Go rob
another makeup store.

01:01:27.188 --> 01:01:28.989
Clean up on aisle three.

01:01:30.391 --> 01:01:33.794
Think he forgot his meds.

01:01:33.827 --> 01:01:36.330
Not a lot of positions
for an out-of-work magician.

01:01:37.798 --> 01:01:40.367
- Birthday parties?
- No.

01:01:40.401 --> 01:01:41.936
Know what those little monsters

01:01:41.969 --> 01:01:43.370
do to magicians
at those parties?

01:01:43.404 --> 01:01:44.972
It's not pretty.

01:01:46.073 --> 01:01:47.274
Birthday party.

01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:49.944
What's today?

01:01:49.977 --> 01:01:51.078
Uh, Friday.

01:01:53.314 --> 01:01:54.481
Friday!

01:01:55.416 --> 01:01:56.817
I suck.

01:01:59.086 --> 01:02:00.254
Put it on my tab.

01:02:22.544 --> 01:02:24.512
I'm sorry.
Brandi, I'm sorry...

01:02:24.546 --> 01:02:26.146
Look, I don't have the energy.

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:27.948
Do you care about anyone
but yourself?

01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:31.185
I'm done.

01:02:49.036 --> 01:02:50.104
Can I come in?

01:02:54.975 --> 01:02:56.310
All right. Um...

01:02:57.278 --> 01:02:58.513
I'm sorry.

01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:01.248
I know I let you down.

01:03:03.017 --> 01:03:04.118
I let everyone down.

01:03:06.253 --> 01:03:07.888
You know, I had a bad day.

01:03:09.857 --> 01:03:11.760
Yeah, that's just an excuse,
isn't it?

01:03:13.528 --> 01:03:15.530
I'm a work in progress, Tim.

01:03:15.563 --> 01:03:18.533
I'm really trying,
but I'm gonna make mistakes.

01:03:18.566 --> 01:03:20.501
But I'll keep trying.
I promise you that.

01:03:22.169 --> 01:03:24.104
Wonder what your parents
would be thinking of me now?

01:03:25.573 --> 01:03:27.174
I'm not much of a father.

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:30.477
I wasn't much
of an uncle either, was I?

01:03:32.514 --> 01:03:34.148
I just hope you can forgive me.

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:37.451
Do you think you can?

01:03:39.086 --> 01:03:41.088
I mean,
you don't have to answer that.

01:03:42.923 --> 01:03:43.924
All right.

01:03:45.627 --> 01:03:47.895
I know she liked it

01:03:47.928 --> 01:03:49.564
when my dad went out of his way.

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.406
Like one time,
he gave up his night at the gym

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.976
to go take a swing dance class
with my mom.

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:05.346
He said that earned him
all sorts of points.

01:04:07.047 --> 01:04:09.517
Dad noticed the little things.

01:04:09.551 --> 01:04:11.985
What little things?
What do you mean?

01:04:12.019 --> 01:04:14.355
Well, "You changed your hair.

01:04:14.388 --> 01:04:15.989
"You've been working out.

01:04:16.691 --> 01:04:18.225
"New outfit."

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:21.862
Got to make sacrifices.

01:04:23.063 --> 01:04:25.065
Sacrifices.

01:04:25.099 --> 01:04:27.635
I don't know
what I'd sacrifice, Tim.

01:04:30.437 --> 01:04:33.974
Well, maybe instead of focusing
on this big trick

01:04:34.007 --> 01:04:36.276
that you think
will make you rich and famous

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:38.379
and attractive to women,

01:04:38.412 --> 01:04:41.516
you should put in the work
like my dad did with my mom.

01:04:51.125 --> 01:04:52.459
Can I help?

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:55.195
You've cooked enough for me.
It's my turn.

01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:57.965
Wow. This is
a pleasant surprise, Max.

01:04:57.998 --> 01:05:01.502
Well, I wouldn't say that
just yet.

01:05:01.536 --> 01:05:05.472
- I hope you like scrambled.
- Yes.

01:05:05.507 --> 01:05:08.275
- Shells or no shells?
- Without shells, Max.

01:05:08.308 --> 01:05:09.644
But I'm not picky.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.382
- Mrs. C?
- Yes.

01:05:18.185 --> 01:05:20.120
Um...

01:05:20.154 --> 01:05:22.089
if you could have one thing,

01:05:22.122 --> 01:05:23.457
just one wish, what would it be?

01:05:25.325 --> 01:05:26.594
I don't know.

01:05:28.429 --> 01:05:32.299
Maybe a planter on my porch
with some flowers in it.

01:05:34.067 --> 01:05:36.136
Ooh.
How's it going, Max?

01:05:37.004 --> 01:05:38.972
What do you think?

01:05:39.006 --> 01:05:41.074
- Oh, my goodness.
- Pretty good, huh?

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:43.511
Uh! Max, Max, Max.

01:05:44.445 --> 01:05:45.979
Mmm.

01:05:46.013 --> 01:05:48.750
- You know what, Mrs. C.
- What?

01:05:48.783 --> 01:05:51.151
I think I have to beg
for my job back.

01:05:53.187 --> 01:05:54.756
I have to do it for Tim.

01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:57.257
I mean,
I got to take care of him.

01:05:57.291 --> 01:06:00.562
So swallow your pride
and just do it.

01:06:00.595 --> 01:06:02.463
Yeah.
I'll tell you what, though.

01:06:02.496 --> 01:06:04.364
If he starts yammering on

01:06:04.398 --> 01:06:06.033
about magic running its course,
and clowns running its course,

01:06:06.066 --> 01:06:07.635
"I'm gonna have
a petting zoo,"

01:06:07.669 --> 01:06:09.436
I don't know
if I can keep a straight face,

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:12.005
much less not hit him.

01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:14.141
You can do it, Max.

01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:18.378
- Mrs. C.
- Mmm-hmm?

01:06:18.412 --> 01:06:21.783
How do I know
if I become a selfless person?

01:06:21.816 --> 01:06:23.417
When it comes
to you naturally

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:25.152
and you don't have
to think about it.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.722
Until then?

01:06:27.755 --> 01:06:31.258
Until then, you just do
what you're doing now.

01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.760
You got a big heart, Max,

01:06:32.794 --> 01:06:34.261
that you don't want
people to see.

01:06:34.294 --> 01:06:35.597
Shh. There are neighbors.

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:38.031
You're a good person, Max.

01:06:38.065 --> 01:06:41.268
Little unorthodox
with your parenting,

01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:44.171
but you care.
I can see it.

01:06:44.204 --> 01:06:47.207
- And you know what?
- What?

01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:49.142
Tim can see it, too.

01:06:51.513 --> 01:06:53.615
- You know what, Mrs. C?
- What?

01:06:53.648 --> 01:06:55.449
You always
make me feel great.

01:06:59.353 --> 01:07:01.221
I love you.

01:07:01.255 --> 01:07:03.290
Mr. C was a lucky man.

01:07:03.323 --> 01:07:04.358
Mmm.

01:07:06.661 --> 01:07:08.362
I love you, too, Max.

01:07:09.731 --> 01:07:11.533
Keep working on it, baby.

01:07:11.566 --> 01:07:12.700
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna build
you a whole bunch of these.

01:07:12.734 --> 01:07:14.434
Oh. Help me.

01:07:15.637 --> 01:07:17.672
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

01:07:17.705 --> 01:07:19.139
Hi.

01:07:19.674 --> 01:07:21.375
Hey, baby.

01:07:21.408 --> 01:07:23.310
Max is right back there.

01:07:25.445 --> 01:07:27.180
Hello.

01:07:27.214 --> 01:07:29.817
Hi.

01:07:29.851 --> 01:07:32.754
I don't wanna punish them
for something someone else did.

01:07:32.787 --> 01:07:34.622
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:07:37.825 --> 01:07:39.794
There's nothing I can say,

01:07:39.827 --> 01:07:41.328
but there is something
I can do.

01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:43.831
Yeah? What is that?

01:07:43.865 --> 01:07:45.733
Be a man.

01:07:45.767 --> 01:07:47.569
I started last night though.

01:07:47.602 --> 01:07:49.369
You can probably tell already,
I shouldn't have said that.

01:07:51.873 --> 01:07:53.608
What is that?

01:07:53.641 --> 01:07:55.342
A planter box,
I built it for Mrs. C.

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:56.544
Pretty nice, huh?

01:07:56.578 --> 01:07:58.412
Oh, I didn't realize
you were handy.

01:07:58.445 --> 01:08:00.815
Yeah.

01:08:00.848 --> 01:08:02.215
You must have
a green thumb.

01:08:02.249 --> 01:08:04.819
Well, I didn't make
the plants.

01:08:04.852 --> 01:08:06.219
I bought 'em.

01:08:07.421 --> 01:08:09.122
It's the thought
that counts.

01:08:09.156 --> 01:08:10.390
Right?

01:08:10.424 --> 01:08:12.426
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:12.459 --> 01:08:14.529
- You're here for play date with Tim?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:14.562 --> 01:08:15.697
Around back.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:16.863
Can I go, Mommy?

01:08:16.898 --> 01:08:18.198
Of course, sweetheart.

01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.265
Ahoy.

01:08:19.299 --> 01:08:21.769
Ahoy.

01:08:21.803 --> 01:08:23.671
And if Mommy
wants a play date...

01:08:24.738 --> 01:08:26.439
That's stupid.

01:08:26.473 --> 01:08:28.341
It was good to see you.

01:08:49.196 --> 01:08:50.497
- Susan.
- Oh.

01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:55.737
You look lovely.

01:09:00.474 --> 01:09:01.943
That's a letter for Mike.

01:09:01.975 --> 01:09:03.711
It's from
an anonymous source.

01:09:03.745 --> 01:09:05.880
And I want you
to deliver it.

01:09:05.912 --> 01:09:07.915
Why? Why don't you
do it yourself?

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:10.818
Because I want you to.

01:09:10.852 --> 01:09:13.888
Isn't that your job,
to deliver correspondents to everybody?

01:09:13.921 --> 01:09:16.524
Kiss my butt.
But I'll do it.

01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:18.826
And then you need
to ask Mike out.

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:20.662
Why?

01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:23.930
Because... he likes you.

01:09:23.965 --> 01:09:26.968
And if you wait for him to ask you
out, you'll both be old and gray

01:09:27.001 --> 01:09:28.803
before he musters
the courage.

01:09:28.836 --> 01:09:30.270
Okay? So.

01:09:30.303 --> 01:09:31.872
Got it.

01:09:31.906 --> 01:09:33.941
Thanks for the tip, Max.

01:09:33.975 --> 01:09:37.310
I take back some of the things
I said about you.

01:09:37.344 --> 01:09:39.446
- Like one or two things.
- Okay.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.849
I said
a lot of bad things.

01:09:41.883 --> 01:09:43.618
- I'll take that.
- Okay.

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.796
Mike! Mike!

01:09:54.829 --> 01:09:56.296
What? What's this?

01:09:56.329 --> 01:09:58.465
It's a letter from
an anonymous source.

01:09:58.498 --> 01:09:59.634
Anonymous? For me?

01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:01.569
- Open it now.
- Yeah.

01:10:04.404 --> 01:10:07.675
"Dear Mike,
if anyone deserves

01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:10.745
"to launch his own repair shop,
it's you.

01:10:10.778 --> 01:10:12.547
"Here's a cashier's check for...

01:10:14.448 --> 01:10:17.484
"for $20,000
to get you started.

01:10:17.518 --> 01:10:20.722
"A friend." Are you serious?
Are you kidding me?

01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:22.623
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm...

01:10:22.657 --> 01:10:24.424
Oh, my gosh!

01:10:24.458 --> 01:10:26.359
- I'm so happy for you!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:10:26.393 --> 01:10:30.464
Yes! Yes, I'll go to dinner
with you tonight to celebrate!

01:10:30.497 --> 01:10:31.999
- Really?
- Yes.

01:10:33.935 --> 01:10:35.870
I apologize
for barging in,

01:10:35.903 --> 01:10:38.973
but I... I really do
need your advice.

01:10:39.006 --> 01:10:41.241
When I first met Max,

01:10:42.309 --> 01:10:43.878
he didn't seem content,

01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:47.782
and he seemed
a little self-absorbed.

01:10:47.815 --> 01:10:51.986
In all honesty, I did not think
that he was father material.

01:10:52.019 --> 01:10:55.523
But I gotta say, it seems like
the proof is in the pudding,

01:10:56.591 --> 01:10:58.659
and I may have misjudged him.

01:10:58.693 --> 01:11:01.996
Max is like
a starched un-pressed shirt

01:11:02.029 --> 01:11:04.364
that needs
a little iron on it.

01:11:05.432 --> 01:11:07.034
Got it.

01:11:07.068 --> 01:11:09.469
He's a work in progress,

01:11:09.503 --> 01:11:12.573
but he has a good heart.
Always has.

01:11:12.607 --> 01:11:17.377
Now, he may become
the best dad in the world,

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:19.479
but then again,
he could drive you crazy.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.696
- You got the stuff?
- What stuff?

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.732
The seeds, man,
the seeds!

01:11:37.765 --> 01:11:39.432
Oh, right.

01:11:40.067 --> 01:11:41.769
Come on.

01:11:41.803 --> 01:11:43.037
Thank you.

01:11:46.808 --> 01:11:49.944
You ever think that your
mom could be into my uncle?

01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:52.713
Ew, if they ever got married
and you got adopted,

01:11:52.747 --> 01:11:54.749
that would make us
brother and sister.

01:11:55.616 --> 01:11:57.885
Good point.

01:11:57.919 --> 01:12:00.888
At first, I would've said
no possible way,

01:12:00.922 --> 01:12:02.623
but I have
this weird feeling.

01:12:02.657 --> 01:12:04.025
Like what?

01:12:04.058 --> 01:12:05.893
Like he might be
growing on her.

01:12:05.927 --> 01:12:07.728
- Yikes.
- I know.

01:12:08.896 --> 01:12:10.363
We have to find
a way to stop this

01:12:10.397 --> 01:12:11.833
before we become
brother and sister.

01:12:11.866 --> 01:12:12.900
But how?

01:12:14.101 --> 01:12:15.536
I don't know.

01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:19.439
Stop.

01:12:19.472 --> 01:12:20.975
Mike.

01:12:21.008 --> 01:12:23.678
Hey. Thank you.

01:12:23.711 --> 01:12:26.047
- For what?
- Susan decided to go out with me.

01:12:26.948 --> 01:12:28.549
That's great.

01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:29.917
Why're you thanking me?

01:12:29.951 --> 01:12:31.484
Because I think
she said yes

01:12:31.519 --> 01:12:33.386
because you made me
look good by comparison.

01:12:35.488 --> 01:12:36.991
Mike, I got problems, man.

01:12:37.024 --> 01:12:39.060
Tomorrow is "bring your parent
to school" day.

01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:40.628
- Nice.
- Not nice.

01:12:40.661 --> 01:12:44.065
What if I blow it,
you know, the kid?

01:12:44.098 --> 01:12:46.067
Plus, there's a fundraiser
after school,

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.637
and for some reason,
I volunteered to be the headliner.

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.006
Wow, that's...
That's high-pressure.

01:12:52.039 --> 01:12:53.440
You're not kidding, man.

01:12:53.473 --> 01:12:55.710
We're talking
about first-graders.

01:12:55.743 --> 01:12:57.078
Brutal.

01:12:57.111 --> 01:12:59.046
Hi, class.

01:13:02.817 --> 01:13:05.686
Well, I should first
start by explaining

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.488
that I am not Tim's dad.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.559
Or his mom.

01:13:17.064 --> 01:13:19.834
Tim's parents
couldn't be here today

01:13:21.535 --> 01:13:24.171
because they are in heaven.

01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:27.742
Let's all take a moment
of silence for Tim.

01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:34.882
Okay, great.

01:13:35.883 --> 01:13:38.219
I am actually Tim's uncle

01:13:38.252 --> 01:13:40.855
and I am a magician.

01:13:42.023 --> 01:13:44.825
Who knows
what a magician is?

01:13:44.859 --> 01:13:46.994
Yeah.
We're not in kindergarten.

01:13:47.962 --> 01:13:49.462
Right.

01:13:49.496 --> 01:13:52.967
Hold your questions
till the end. Thank you.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.204
Now I'm sure you've all seen me
in my television commercials.

01:13:57.238 --> 01:14:01.142
Well, the parents have...

01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:03.945
Okay, well,
why don't I get started

01:14:03.978 --> 01:14:05.980
with a good easy trick?

01:14:06.013 --> 01:14:11.018
And I think that
Mr. Helpful over here

01:14:11.052 --> 01:14:13.688
is gonna be
my lovely assistant,

01:14:13.721 --> 01:14:15.923
for I do believe

01:14:15.957 --> 01:14:19.026
that you have something
behind your ear.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:21.529
Where did that come from?

01:14:21.562 --> 01:14:24.497
Isn't that egg-cellent?

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:30.104
Now, I'm going to levitate
this egg over your head,

01:14:30.137 --> 01:14:34.675
and what you have to do
is say the magic word.

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:38.779
The magic word
is "scrambled."

01:14:40.548 --> 01:14:43.150
Scrambled.

01:14:43.184 --> 01:14:44.652
Are you ready?

01:14:46.587 --> 01:14:47.655
Scrambled.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.762
I'm so sorry.

01:14:54.795 --> 01:14:55.896
Here you go.

01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:57.865
Wipe yourself off,
young man.

01:14:59.867 --> 01:15:02.870
Uh-oh, that was
the wrong rag.

01:15:02.903 --> 01:15:04.538
Whoops.

01:15:06.841 --> 01:15:10.144
Now, does anybody
have $20, please?

01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:13.914
Do the parents have $20?

01:15:14.915 --> 01:15:16.550
How about $10?

01:15:16.584 --> 01:15:19.220
Can I get
a ten-spot, please?

01:15:19.253 --> 01:15:21.655
Wow, thank you.
You're very brave.

01:15:21.689 --> 01:15:24.992
Now, I am going to rip

01:15:25.026 --> 01:15:29.196
this $10 bill four times.

01:15:32.299 --> 01:15:34.168
Oh, no, wait.

01:15:34.201 --> 01:15:37.571
This was supposed
to be a rope.

01:15:37.605 --> 01:15:39.707
Does anybody
have a rope?

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:41.776
How about a string?

01:15:42.743 --> 01:15:44.578
Oh. Well,

01:15:44.612 --> 01:15:47.348
I am feeling very bad
about your money, sir.

01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:50.951
Would you please check
your inside pocket?

01:15:53.921 --> 01:15:55.089
Nothing.

01:15:55.756 --> 01:15:57.658
Nothing?

01:15:57.691 --> 01:16:00.928
Well, where could it be?

01:16:00.961 --> 01:16:05.032
Perhaps it's
in this levitating bag!

01:16:05.066 --> 01:16:06.801
Whose backpack is that?

01:16:08.202 --> 01:16:10.805
That's real money, kids.
Get it!

01:16:15.176 --> 01:16:17.178
Where did all this money
come from?

01:16:17.211 --> 01:16:19.613
It's raining! It's raining!

01:16:19.647 --> 01:16:21.682
You better get that.
That's real money.

01:16:21.715 --> 01:16:23.751
Let's go! Let's go!

01:16:24.785 --> 01:16:26.087
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.923
And Max is so rad,
he made this backpack

01:16:28.956 --> 01:16:30.257
levitate in the air

01:16:30.291 --> 01:16:32.359
and then a bunch of money
came raining down.

01:16:32.393 --> 01:16:34.695
Where did all
the money come from?

01:16:34.728 --> 01:16:37.631
A magician never reveals
his secrets.

01:16:37.665 --> 01:16:39.767
But I swear, he was
like Robin Hood.

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.136
Taking from the rich
and giving it to the poor.

01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:44.638
It was so cool.

01:16:45.306 --> 01:16:46.841
Oh, right.

01:16:46.874 --> 01:16:48.876
And, um, he gives me cookies
for breakfast.

01:16:48.909 --> 01:16:51.178
By the way,
it's super bad for your teeth.

01:16:52.713 --> 01:16:54.381
Ix-nay on the ool-kay.

01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:55.883
Hey.

01:16:56.851 --> 01:16:58.786
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:58.819 --> 01:17:00.688
I heard you were a hit
at Parent Day.

01:17:00.721 --> 01:17:03.057
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:03.090 --> 01:17:05.726
First let me say, whoa.

01:17:07.161 --> 01:17:10.331
And second...
Hey, Tim.

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:13.000
Thanks for the good props,
wingman.

01:17:16.737 --> 01:17:19.140
Is there something going on
with you?

01:17:19.173 --> 01:17:20.708
Why do you ask?

01:17:20.741 --> 01:17:23.777
I don't know.
I, uh, I noticed a change.

01:17:25.479 --> 01:17:26.881
I'm blossoming.

01:17:28.849 --> 01:17:30.384
It might just be
my imagination.

01:17:30.417 --> 01:17:33.120
No, I'm blossoming.

01:17:33.154 --> 01:17:34.421
Well, it shows.

01:17:35.823 --> 01:17:37.791
He has been good for me.

01:17:37.825 --> 01:17:40.728
He makes me
see things differently.

01:17:40.761 --> 01:17:42.863
He lights up
when he talks about you.

01:17:42.897 --> 01:17:44.265
Yeah?

01:17:44.298 --> 01:17:46.066
You know who else
he lights up for?

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:51.338
I was thinkin'
Friday after school,

01:17:51.372 --> 01:17:52.973
if you're not busy,
we come back here,

01:17:53.007 --> 01:17:55.109
we'll have a nice picnic,
all the the four of us.

01:17:55.142 --> 01:17:58.145
We'll do it here, too, because
this is gonna be our spot.

01:17:58.179 --> 01:18:01.715
I don't know.
Um, we got a lot going on.

01:18:01.749 --> 01:18:03.384
Right after school?

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:06.020
Well, yes,
I mean, we have...

01:18:06.053 --> 01:18:07.488
We're going
into the weekend,

01:18:07.522 --> 01:18:09.924
and Brandi has this thing...

01:18:09.957 --> 01:18:13.027
I'm not talking about anything different
than what we're doing right now.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.729
Except with food
in a basket.

01:18:15.763 --> 01:18:18.766
I know.
I will think about it.

01:18:18.799 --> 01:18:21.001
Good. And when you
decide yes,

01:18:21.035 --> 01:18:22.736
come meet us back here

01:18:22.770 --> 01:18:24.772
and maybe
we'll be here, too.

01:18:24.805 --> 01:18:26.106
And if you can't make it,
don't worry.

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:27.841
We probably
couldn't either.

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:31.513
I like spending time
with you.

01:18:31.546 --> 01:18:33.714
And making sure
you eat.

01:18:35.282 --> 01:18:37.117
We'll see.

01:18:37.151 --> 01:18:38.886
Thank you
for the invitation.

01:18:38.919 --> 01:18:40.921
You're welcome.
See you Friday.

01:18:40.955 --> 01:18:42.156
Okay.

01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:43.525
Tim!

01:18:43.558 --> 01:18:47.161
Report back to base
at 6:00 p.m., soldier!

01:18:48.195 --> 01:18:50.064
That's military talk.

01:18:51.398 --> 01:18:52.499
Bye.

01:18:59.273 --> 01:19:03.911
We have to stop this picnic/romantic
interlude at all cost.

01:19:03.944 --> 01:19:05.547
But how?

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.515
I have an idea.

01:19:07.549 --> 01:19:10.050
Well, we might be doing something
else right after school.

01:19:13.921 --> 01:19:15.155
Mike...

01:19:16.023 --> 01:19:17.559
business is dead.

01:19:17.592 --> 01:19:20.261
No customers means
there's no sales,

01:19:20.294 --> 01:19:24.832
no sales means
there's no broke cars...

01:19:24.865 --> 01:19:28.102
and no broke cars means
there's nothing for you to fix.

01:19:28.135 --> 01:19:30.971
So, it's over.

01:19:31.005 --> 01:19:33.974
Well, I'll be fine, boss.
I'm more worried about you.

01:19:34.008 --> 01:19:37.011
You know Chubby
is no Max.

01:19:37.044 --> 01:19:40.881
He's got these freaky balloon
animals, they're scaring all the kids.

01:19:40.914 --> 01:19:43.551
Do you know
any good magicians?

01:19:43.585 --> 01:19:45.986
- Only one.
- How's that for timing?

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:47.421
No, no, no.

01:19:47.454 --> 01:19:49.823
Don't poop your pants.

01:19:49.857 --> 01:19:51.425
I came to apologize.

01:19:52.393 --> 01:19:55.195
So, how's business?

01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:57.031
Business is business.

01:19:57.064 --> 01:19:58.999
You know how it is
this time of the year,

01:19:59.033 --> 01:20:02.069
you gotta mix things up
and get a gimmick...

01:20:02.102 --> 01:20:04.938
Magic has a shelf life.

01:20:06.574 --> 01:20:08.842
Clowns are fun
for a while.

01:20:08.876 --> 01:20:11.045
Hey!

01:20:11.078 --> 01:20:13.881
Maybe next week,
we'll have a petting zoo.

01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:18.620
Maybe I might be able
to save your bacon.

01:20:18.653 --> 01:20:20.354
- You wanna hear my plan?
- Yeah.

01:20:22.056 --> 01:20:23.591
Hear me out.
Flubby.

01:20:23.625 --> 01:20:25.593
It's Chubby.

01:20:25.627 --> 01:20:27.328
How many clowns
do you know?

01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:29.496
I know a few, why?

01:20:29.531 --> 01:20:32.199
We're gonna need more
than a few.

01:20:32.232 --> 01:20:34.168
Or at least their costumes.

01:20:34.201 --> 01:20:36.538
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

01:20:36.571 --> 01:20:38.872
I was so hoping
you would say that.

01:20:39.907 --> 01:20:41.075
See you.

01:20:59.661 --> 01:21:02.196
Well, I just had a nice chat
with your principal.

01:21:03.997 --> 01:21:05.299
You want to tell me
your side?

01:21:06.166 --> 01:21:07.468
Clifford.

01:21:09.436 --> 01:21:11.939
You really belted him, huh?

01:21:11.972 --> 01:21:13.907
Yeah, I got in
a couple good ones.

01:21:13.941 --> 01:21:15.643
That's my man.

01:21:15.677 --> 01:21:18.011
I thought you'd be mad.

01:21:18.045 --> 01:21:20.314
You do know that
we had a picnic planned

01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:22.316
with Brandi's mom
and Brandi.

01:21:24.017 --> 01:21:26.053
What's that face for?

01:21:27.287 --> 01:21:29.323
Uncle Max...

01:21:29.356 --> 01:21:31.058
if you guys keep
hanging out,

01:21:31.091 --> 01:21:33.260
then there's a chance
you could get married,

01:21:33.293 --> 01:21:35.329
and that would be bad.

01:21:35.362 --> 01:21:36.598
Why would that be bad?

01:21:36.631 --> 01:21:39.366
Because if you adopted me,

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:43.370
then me and Brandi
would be brother and sister.

01:21:43.404 --> 01:21:48.108
Well, let's not get
our hopes up, okay?

01:21:48.142 --> 01:21:49.977
Brandi's mom can barely
stand me right now.

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.446
I mean, she probably
left that picnic,

01:21:52.479 --> 01:21:54.616
if she even showed up
in the first place.

01:21:55.416 --> 01:21:56.718
Let's go then.

01:21:56.751 --> 01:21:58.452
- All right. All right.
- Come on!

01:22:35.189 --> 01:22:36.591
Where are they?

01:22:43.230 --> 01:22:44.632
Oh.

01:22:44.666 --> 01:22:48.770
Oh, you made it.
We were beginning to wonder.

01:22:48.803 --> 01:22:52.272
Well, we had a little bid-ness to
take care of after school, right?

01:22:52.306 --> 01:22:56.076
- My man, Tim, here had to...
- Take out the trash.

01:22:56.109 --> 01:22:58.045
- Clean-up duty.
- Yeah.

01:22:59.313 --> 01:23:00.347
Yeah.

01:23:21.536 --> 01:23:22.637
- Aah!
- No!

01:23:22.670 --> 01:23:24.739
Tim!

01:23:33.748 --> 01:23:36.250
I tried to grab his hand,

01:23:36.283 --> 01:23:37.785
but I couldn't hold him.

01:23:37.819 --> 01:23:41.623
Hey, you gave it
your best shot.

01:23:41.656 --> 01:23:44.792
And it was our fault for
letting you guys climb so high.

01:23:44.826 --> 01:23:48.428
One thing you can't stop
is kids being kids.

01:23:48.462 --> 01:23:50.097
I'll be right back,
sweetheart.

01:23:51.398 --> 01:23:52.700
Mrs. C will take care of you.

01:23:52.734 --> 01:23:54.101
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:23:54.134 --> 01:23:55.837
Come on, baby.

01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:58.305
Come to Mrs. C.

01:23:58.338 --> 01:24:00.340
Yeah, you're
gonna be all right.

01:24:10.585 --> 01:24:11.819
Hi, Mom.

01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:14.321
Dad.

01:24:14.354 --> 01:24:16.290
Dad, wait, wait.
Before you say anything,

01:24:16.323 --> 01:24:18.560
I want to say something
to you first, okay?

01:24:21.461 --> 01:24:23.665
I wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

01:24:27.434 --> 01:24:30.638
I'm sorry that I made you
worry about me so much.

01:24:30.672 --> 01:24:33.173
You worked so hard
for us,

01:24:33.206 --> 01:24:35.643
and you had so much
on your plate, and I just...

01:24:36.811 --> 01:24:39.146
piled more on.

01:24:39.179 --> 01:24:43.651
Because I understand now.

01:24:43.685 --> 01:24:46.286
I really know what it means
to love somebody...

01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:48.455
so much.

01:24:51.391 --> 01:24:54.261
Dad, I'm you now.

01:24:54.294 --> 01:24:56.598
But I don't know
what to do.

01:24:59.801 --> 01:25:02.269
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything, okay?

01:25:04.906 --> 01:25:06.608
Yeah, I love you, too.

01:25:10.277 --> 01:25:11.646
Hey, bud.

01:25:13.347 --> 01:25:14.582
It's Uncle Max.

01:25:15.617 --> 01:25:16.684
Hey.

01:25:17.652 --> 01:25:19.353
This is all my fault.

01:25:21.188 --> 01:25:23.758
I should have been
paying better attention to you.

01:25:25.593 --> 01:25:28.328
I should have been the grown-up
that I was supposed to be.

01:25:29.797 --> 01:25:31.666
And I let you down, buddy.

01:25:33.367 --> 01:25:34.869
Can I go home?

01:25:35.770 --> 01:25:37.605
Oh, you bet.

01:25:37.639 --> 01:25:40.474
We're gonna go home
to our home.

01:25:40.508 --> 01:25:42.610
And then I'm gonna
take you camping,

01:25:42.644 --> 01:25:44.277
I'm gonna teach you
how to fish.

01:25:44.311 --> 01:25:46.179
I'm gonna teach you
how to drive.

01:25:47.582 --> 01:25:49.617
I'm gonna teach you
every magic trick I know.

01:25:49.651 --> 01:25:51.853
I'm definitely gonna teach
you how to climb trees

01:25:51.886 --> 01:25:53.487
that are lower
to the ground.

01:25:54.889 --> 01:25:56.924
And I'll never take you
for granted.

01:25:57.859 --> 01:25:59.259
Dad?

01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:01.896
No. It's just me.

01:26:01.929 --> 01:26:04.632
Oh, hi, Uncle Max.

01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:06.934
How you doing?

01:26:07.902 --> 01:26:09.436
Why are you shaking?

01:26:13.273 --> 01:26:15.442
Tim, I'm shaking

01:26:15.475 --> 01:26:18.813
because I just realized
how much you mean to me.

01:26:18.846 --> 01:26:21.348
And I've never felt
anything like this before.

01:26:22.449 --> 01:26:24.919
It's a little scary.

01:26:24.952 --> 01:26:28.488
You look like my dad when I
chipped my tooth in kindergarten.

01:26:29.857 --> 01:26:32.794
Did I ever tell you
that your dad

01:26:32.827 --> 01:26:36.463
was like a dad to me
when I was your age

01:26:36.496 --> 01:26:38.298
because I was always
getting in trouble

01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:41.602
and, um, he was always
looking out for me.

01:26:43.037 --> 01:26:45.405
I miss him and Mom.

01:26:46.007 --> 01:26:49.476
I do, too.

01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:53.246
Pretty sure they'd be handling
it a lot better than I am.

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.817
No. You're doin' all right.

01:26:56.617 --> 01:26:58.418
Thanks, bud.

01:26:59.687 --> 01:27:01.656
You gotta get
some rest now, okay?

01:27:01.689 --> 01:27:03.524
Thanks, Uncle Max.

01:27:16.503 --> 01:27:19.707
I think the doctors are
actually more worried about me.

01:27:19.741 --> 01:27:21.909
They checked
my blood pressure six times.

01:27:30.518 --> 01:27:32.520
I'm feeling
a little better.

01:27:41.394 --> 01:27:42.429
Mmm.

01:27:46.399 --> 01:27:48.468
Almost fully recovered.

01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:05.553
Oh, there he is.

01:28:05.586 --> 01:28:07.622
I've been thinking
about your proposal.

01:28:07.655 --> 01:28:09.557
You have? That's great.

01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:12.960
Listen, order yourself a
stiff one and keep thinking.

01:28:12.994 --> 01:28:14.327
Jimbo.

01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:15.997
I'd say
I'll see you tomorrow,

01:28:16.030 --> 01:28:17.464
but I won't.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.668
- <i>Adios.</i>
- Oh, um...

01:28:20.701 --> 01:28:23.704
About that new trick,
I'd like to talk about that.

01:28:23.738 --> 01:28:25.006
- You would?
- Yeah.

01:28:25.039 --> 01:28:26.574
Well, I'd love to tell you
about that,

01:28:26.607 --> 01:28:28.776
but I'm not gonna.

01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:31.913
My phone's been ringing off the hook
with calls from other dealerships.

01:28:31.946 --> 01:28:35.950
Well, if that trick's
half of what you say it is,

01:28:35.983 --> 01:28:38.052
- I'll...
- Double my pay.

01:28:38.085 --> 01:28:39.887
Give you
a 5% raise?

01:28:41.088 --> 01:28:43.658
Okay. Okay.

01:28:43.691 --> 01:28:45.726
This is what I got planned.

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.460
The car's here.

01:28:59.106 --> 01:29:01.042
Thank you everyone
for being here today.

01:29:01.075 --> 01:29:04.078
We wish Magic Motors
every success.

01:29:04.111 --> 01:29:07.548
- Whoo!
- Congratulations!

01:29:10.051 --> 01:29:11.819
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:29:11.853 --> 01:29:14.421
I, Max "the Magical,"

01:29:14.454 --> 01:29:18.025
would like to welcome you
all to the grand reboot

01:29:18.059 --> 01:29:20.695
of Magic Motors.

01:29:24.165 --> 01:29:26.901
Today, we have
an amazing experience

01:29:26.934 --> 01:29:29.637
for you that
you will never forget.

01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:33.074
So, are you prepared
to be amazed?

01:29:33.107 --> 01:29:36.811
Are you prepared
to be astonished?

01:29:36.844 --> 01:29:40.681
Are you prepared
to be mystified?

01:29:40.715 --> 01:29:42.850
Yes!

01:29:42.884 --> 01:29:44.652
Now I must confide in you

01:29:44.685 --> 01:29:46.787
our owner here
at Magic Motors

01:29:46.821 --> 01:29:49.557
has gone completely bonkers.

01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:52.994
Our owner, Mr. Grismer,

01:29:53.027 --> 01:29:57.999
is offering
a $750 discount check

01:29:58.032 --> 01:30:01.501
to every single customer here,

01:30:01.535 --> 01:30:06.107
picked by a clown today.

01:30:06.140 --> 01:30:09.110
Now of course I said,
"Are you mad, man?

01:30:09.143 --> 01:30:11.444
"Don't you want
to make any money?"

01:30:11.478 --> 01:30:15.082
But he told me the customer
here at Magic Motors

01:30:15.116 --> 01:30:17.685
always comes first.

01:30:20.521 --> 01:30:22.623
And so,

01:30:22.657 --> 01:30:24.859
and without further ado,

01:30:25.826 --> 01:30:27.962
send in the clowns.

01:30:40.274 --> 01:30:41.575
Whoa.

01:30:44.211 --> 01:30:45.445
Whoa.

01:30:59.894 --> 01:31:01.796
Thank you.

01:31:01.829 --> 01:31:03.698
Thank you, everyone.

01:31:04.632 --> 01:31:07.001
Now let's buy some cars.

01:31:13.107 --> 01:31:15.209
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:32:01.055 --> 01:32:03.090
Hey, mister,
can I have a balloon?

01:32:03.124 --> 01:32:05.726
- Sure, kid.
- Thanks.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.262
Be sure to tell your parents
where you got it.

01:32:32.119 --> 01:32:33.721
<i>How about this?</i>

01:32:33.754 --> 01:32:35.890
<i>Uncle Max isn't
scared anymore.</i>

01:32:35.923 --> 01:32:37.591
<i>Of love, I mean.</i>

01:32:37.625 --> 01:32:39.093
What do we have here?

01:32:40.061 --> 01:32:43.664
Likes? Not loves?

01:32:43.697 --> 01:32:45.099
Slow down, Mario Andretti.

01:32:45.132 --> 01:32:48.002
Who carves "likes"
on a tree?

01:32:48.035 --> 01:32:50.037
Check back with me
in a couple of months.

01:32:55.943 --> 01:32:57.978
- So disgusting!
- Really?

01:33:02.716 --> 01:33:04.318
So inappropriate.

01:33:04.351 --> 01:33:06.287
All right, all right.

01:33:07.188 --> 01:33:09.223
I think... Yeah.

01:33:09.256 --> 01:33:11.926
I have one more trick
up my sleeve.

01:33:12.893 --> 01:33:15.162
Abra-cadubra!

01:33:17.064 --> 01:33:19.100
Come here, little rascal.

01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:24.772
A puppy? For me?

01:33:24.805 --> 01:33:27.074
Well, yeah, I don't think I
know the spell to send her back,

01:33:27.108 --> 01:33:28.809
so I guess
you can keep her.

01:33:28.843 --> 01:33:29.977
