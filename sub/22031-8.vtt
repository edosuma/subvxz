WEBVTT

01:12.339 --> 01:13.772
Yes?

01:15.742 --> 01:19.178
I'm off to see Cook.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.413
I just wanted to say good luck.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.519
Uh, you...

01:27.521 --> 01:29.555
you just missed a...

01:29.557 --> 01:31.223
Oh.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.092
I'll get it for you.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.730
Selah will be glad to see you.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.168
Will he?

01:44.871 --> 01:47.606
The moment after
I show him this pardon,

01:47.608 --> 01:49.308
I have the grand
privilege to inform him

01:49.310 --> 01:51.743
that all we own is forfeit.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.713
And the last of his estate is being
parceled off to the Royal Army by you.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.116
His fields will be seized
with or without me,

01:57.118 --> 01:59.751
but with me, we earn
the trust of the enemy.

01:59.753 --> 02:03.388
At least he'll be spared the pain
of looking on Setauket again.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.859
Maybe life will improve
for us in Connecticut.

02:08.828 --> 02:10.529
Connecticut?

02:10.531 --> 02:13.765
Selah has family there and he
can recover under their care.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.169
There's nothing left
for us on Long Island.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.243
I can't help but think about how things
might have turned out differently.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.478
Oh.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.914
Major Hewlett,
he was determined

02:28.916 --> 02:31.550
to make a disciplinary example for
what happened in the tavern...

02:31.552 --> 02:33.252
I meant between us.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.854
If you hadn't
broken our engagement,

02:35.856 --> 02:37.389
none of this would've happened.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.757
- It wasn't that simple.
- It was.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.325
- No. No.
- Yes, it was.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.595
I had obligations
to my family, to my father.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.898
A father you never agreed with.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.668
Look, after my brother
died at those riots...

02:49.670 --> 02:52.171
Your brother died
fighting for the king.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.206
If Thomas' fate wasn't
a clear sign from God

02:54.208 --> 02:55.941
to make a break with your
family, I don't know what is.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.943
- You know nothing about it.
- Then tell me what happened.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.545
Tell me why
you broke your promise.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.414
This is likely the last
we're to see each other.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.616
Tell me the truth.

03:05.818 --> 03:08.654
The truth is some things
just aren't meant to be.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.400
Shoulder your firelocks!

03:24.904 --> 03:29.241
Colonel Lee Bowman.
Major John Ainsley.

03:29.243 --> 03:34.379
Captain Colin Darbyshire.
Captain Samuel Tallmadge.

03:41.321 --> 03:43.855
<i>Where are ya, Benjamin?</i>

03:45.458 --> 03:47.392
Can you believe
the whelp didn't come

03:47.394 --> 03:49.328
to collect his own brother?

03:55.401 --> 03:58.237
If it were my kin
on a prison ship,

03:58.239 --> 04:01.673
<i>I'd be the first one</i>
<i>to welcome him home.</i>

04:18.257 --> 04:20.692
Selah.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.829
Caleb... Brewster.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.864
What are you doing here?
Where's Samuel?

04:25.866 --> 04:27.432
Samuel.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.501
Yeah, Ben's brother.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.537
The man they just called out.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.641
Where's Samuel?

04:35.643 --> 04:39.611
Dead.
He's dead.

04:44.317 --> 04:48.487
Selah Strong, dead.

04:58.531 --> 05:01.033
Ooh.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.835
These two seem
to know each other.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.471
Robert Rogers was the one
that pulled you out?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.006
Aye.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.608
Shite.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.551
Hold fire!

05:19.553 --> 05:22.421
The shot came from our side!
From those trees!

05:22.423 --> 05:25.991
Rearguard formation!
Get him up!

05:25.993 --> 05:29.661
Get back, men!
Get behind the wagon!

05:29.663 --> 05:31.663
You four come with me.

05:40.573 --> 05:42.908
Major Rogers,

05:42.910 --> 05:46.445
you fired on an exchange sanctioned
under the flag of truce.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.680
I am hunting a fugitive

05:48.682 --> 05:50.782
who is masquerading
as a soldier.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.852
A man you just let slip
to the other side.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.520
You have overstepped
your bounds.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.989
I will be reporting this
incident to your superiors.

05:57.991 --> 06:02.527
I'll leave the chinwagging in your
capable hands, then, Captain.

06:09.135 --> 06:11.570
What do we do now?

06:11.572 --> 06:14.940
Now we are going
to hunt down Mr. Strong

06:14.942 --> 06:17.609
and that curious
bearded bastard

06:17.611 --> 06:19.411
before they warn Tallmadge.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.414
But ain't that rebel land
that they're crossing into?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.516
It's my land, pup.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.452
It's all my land.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.689
<i>♪ Hush, hush</i>

06:30.691 --> 06:32.491
<i>♪ There's snakes</i>
<i>in the garden ♪</i>

06:32.493 --> 06:36.094
<i>♪ Soul for sale</i>

06:36.096 --> 06:38.797
<i>♪ Blood on the rise</i>

06:40.466 --> 06:42.667
<i>♪ Hush, hush</i>

06:42.669 --> 06:46.905
- <i>♪ I can't wait anymore</i>
<i>- ♪ Soul for sale</i>

06:48.408 --> 06:52.177
<i>♪ I can't wait anymore</i>

06:54.447 --> 06:57.849
<i>♪ Hush, hush.</i>

07:01.053 --> 07:03.054
Done and done.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.458
Who needs the green fields of Connecticut,
I say, when we have Long Island?

07:06.460 --> 07:08.093
Land flowing with
milk and honey.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.028
Or pork and cauliflower.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.197
Be sure to give your father
my best upon your return.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.533
Oh, I shall indeed,
but, uh, he also said

07:14.535 --> 07:16.134
he expected me
to return with a story.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.537
- Did he, now?
- Well, he did.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.871
He said, "Son,
you're in York City",

07:19.873 --> 07:21.206
the greatest port
in the colonies.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.775
Drink Spanish wine,
eat Scottish salmon and...

07:23.777 --> 07:26.611
- ...sing the "Song of Solomon!"
- That's right.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.714
I was hoping that you might show
me the best places for singing.

07:29.716 --> 07:32.184
At my expense, of course, and
we'll celebrate our deal.

07:32.186 --> 07:34.186
Yes, well, I recommend you
sample it all, my lad,

07:34.188 --> 07:35.921
but I'm afraid you have
to sing solo tonight.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.889
I have a previous engagement.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.459
Passing up on free quim?
Must be important.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.028
Who said anything
about passing up quim?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.830
I see.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.198
What sort
of engagement is this?

07:46.200 --> 07:48.667
Oh, a local chapter
of a very old club.

07:48.669 --> 07:52.003
- The Masons?
- No, much more fun.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.606
No, tonight's dinner is
headed by Major John Andre

07:54.608 --> 07:56.908
and he's a marvelous
toastmaster.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.176
Oh.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.646
Of course, outsiders
are rarely allowed.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.250
But there are exceptions.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.719
Especially if there's
business to be done.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.789
Business?

08:12.692 --> 08:14.726
What, you just
leave him here, then?

08:14.728 --> 08:16.661
He's not Samuel Tallmadge.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.263
He's not even a soldier.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.031
No, he's Selah Strong.
I've known him all my life.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.933
He's more Patriot
than you and I put together.

08:21.935 --> 08:24.970
He's not on the list.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.205
And he was released
to our care by the enemy

08:27.207 --> 08:29.808
- with some theatrics to boot.
- Theatrics?

08:29.810 --> 08:32.277
He's calling your wound theatrics.
I'd knock him out.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.679
I will not bring him into camp.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.881
Go.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.517
I can make it on my own.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.552
You can barely stand
on your own two feet.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.854
All right, when
you do get back to camp,

08:42.856 --> 08:46.024
you find Major Tallmadge,
tell him you're a nob,

08:46.026 --> 08:47.526
and then tell him
"Genevieve."

08:47.528 --> 08:50.228
All right?
He'll know what I mean.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.030
Come on, Strong.

08:52.032 --> 08:55.767
You're stuck with me till we
get into friendly territory.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.080
When you're on the march,

09:09.082 --> 09:11.917
act as if you were
sneaking up on a deer.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.653
Or a lion.

09:14.655 --> 09:16.187
You don't weight me down
like a mule,

09:16.189 --> 09:18.056
maybe I don't
make so much noise.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.624
Shh.

09:24.130 --> 09:29.301
See your enemy first
before he sees you, boy.

09:32.004 --> 09:35.874
My name is Jordan,
not "boy."

09:37.076 --> 09:39.210
What's your true name, boy?

09:39.212 --> 09:42.047
The one they beat out of you?

09:43.149 --> 09:44.749
Akinbode.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.652
- Louder.
- Akinbode.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.622
<i>Good, and do
you know who I am?</i>

09:50.624 --> 09:54.593
I'm the one who's gonna
give you your name back

09:54.595 --> 09:57.329
as soon as I stop
hearing you breathe.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.952
<i>Anna?</i>

10:23.389 --> 10:25.991
What are you doing here?
Where's Selah?

10:25.993 --> 10:27.659
How did it go with Cook?

10:30.396 --> 10:33.732
He refused to sign
the agreement, didn't he?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.934
Where is he?
I'll talk to...

10:35.936 --> 10:37.836
First, tell me what happened.

10:43.242 --> 10:47.145
I signed over the
cauliflower, so that's done.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.981
And then you gained his trust?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.884
What I gained was an invite

10:52.886 --> 10:55.353
to a social affair
at Major John Andre's house.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.822
I can't have either of you
two frustrating the scheme.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.158
I won't.
I want to go with you.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.961
Where?
To the dinner?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.295
- Tonight?
- You're allowed a guest.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.331
This is the same
Major John Andre

11:06.333 --> 11:08.366
whom I deciphered
the safe house letter from.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.102
The same Major John Andre whom my
housemaid Abigail is now set under.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.138
- Well...
- I have friends inside. If it's a supper...

11:13.140 --> 11:15.774
Abigail will likely be getting
supplies at the market near his house.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.710
- And does Selah know about this?
- Selah's dead.

11:20.212 --> 11:23.048
He's been dead for two months.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.284
I have nowhere to go.
I am going with you.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.128
- Anna, I am so sorry.
- To hell with sorrow.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.398
It's revenge I'm after
and I'll see it done.

11:43.335 --> 11:45.270
Listen to me.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.740
While you are in this state, you
will likely give us both away.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.775
That is why I can't take you.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.410
They have taken
everything from me.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.012
I know.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.915
I'll be back tomorrow morning.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.117
We can talk about
everything, all right?

11:59.119 --> 12:01.953
But until then, you must promise
me that you'll wait here.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.024
Promise me you'll wait.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.032
Just a bit further.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.135
Can't.
Need to rest.

12:17.137 --> 12:22.240
All right, here. Sip and stretch.
Can't stop long.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.779
Here.

12:27.781 --> 12:31.216
So, this Genevieve...

12:32.017 --> 12:33.318
is a tavern wench?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.754
Aye, prettiest I've ever seen.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.056
That's where we're headed...
Elizabeth Town Tavern.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.158
Was she dark or fair?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.426
She were both.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.329
Like my Anna?

12:46.967 --> 12:49.100
Get down!

12:58.177 --> 13:00.411
It's three against two.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.480
In your shite condition, it's
more like three against one.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.917
- Robert Rogers?
- Aye, I think so.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.086
Give me a gun.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.257
Well, the bright side,
if Rogers does kill us,

13:12.259 --> 13:15.426
<i>at least Benny boy will be still
alive to murder him, huh?</i>

13:24.870 --> 13:26.971
- Captain Henry?
- Major.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.373
What news of
the prisoner exchange?

13:28.375 --> 13:31.543
We were ambushed, sir.
Queen's Rangers.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.044
What?

13:33.046 --> 13:34.813
My brother?
Where's my brother?

13:34.815 --> 13:36.881
They attempted to pose another
man in his stead, sir.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.983
<i>Brewster vouched for him,</i>
<i>but I couldn't risk</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:40.318
bringing an unknown
prisoner back to camp.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.587
What about Brewster?
Where's Brewster?

13:42.589 --> 13:44.856
He headed north, sir,
through neutral territory.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.425
He said to tell you
"Genevieve."

13:47.427 --> 13:49.093
He was sure you'd
understand what it meant.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.895
Come on, boy.

13:57.871 --> 14:01.306
Three dozen to be sent directly to
the residence of Major John Andre.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.041
Abigail.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.976
Anna.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.212
You're in New York?

14:07.214 --> 14:09.013
- But why?
- Cicero's fine, Abby.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.915
He's staying with Aberdeen
for a short spell

14:10.917 --> 14:13.017
while I take care of
business here in the city.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.019
Did you get my message
about Simcoe?

14:15.021 --> 14:17.021
I did and I thank you,
but right now

14:17.023 --> 14:19.357
I'm more concerned with the dinner
you're preparing for tonight.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.559
- How did you know?
- I want you to help me get in.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.329
You don't, trust me.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.997
It's no place for a lady.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.467
- Especially you.
- You let me determine that.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.570
It's too dangerous for me.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.307
You asked a favor of me once.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.876
You asked me to care
for your son.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.544
I want that favor returned.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.047
- You don't own me anymore.
- I own nothing anymore.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.316
And you will get me into that
party whether you like it or not.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.285
Madam, is this slave
troubling you?

14:47.287 --> 14:50.021
<i>If so, I'll see to it</i>
<i>she's taken care of.</i>

14:50.023 --> 14:54.225
No, we just had a simple
misunderstanding.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.462
But that's all been made clear.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.230
Isn't that right?

15:05.070 --> 15:07.939
<i>Thank you for sitting
with me, Mr. Robeson.</i>

15:07.941 --> 15:10.608
Well, If I can be
of aid, I will.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.477
I've been charged
by Major Hewlett

15:12.479 --> 15:15.446
- with ferreting out a conspiracy in town.
- Conspiracy?

15:15.448 --> 15:19.350
Tell me what you know about Benjamin
Tallmadge and Caleb Brewster.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.452
Well, there's not much
to tell, really.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.021
Any associates?
People in the town

15:23.023 --> 15:24.289
they might've been
in league with?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.658
Well, there's
Tallmadge's father.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.526
He used to be
the minister here.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.128
And Brewster?

15:30.130 --> 15:34.198
His father died of the
palsy a few years back.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.634
Has a sister
still alive with it

15:36.636 --> 15:38.269
and an uncle
he was very fond of.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.940
What about that weasel
Woodhull, for example?

15:41.942 --> 15:45.109
The one who got away with the
murder of Captain Joyce?

15:47.379 --> 15:49.447
Ensign Clayton
killed the captain.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.951
<i>Do you really believe that one
of His Majesty's finest captains</i>

15:52.953 --> 15:55.286
was done in by
the regimental drummer?

16:01.060 --> 16:04.062
If it's rebel sympathizers
you're looking for,

16:04.064 --> 16:08.333
the petition for the New York
Convention is a good place to start.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.069
Petition?

16:13.506 --> 16:15.540
<i>You sing the girl part.</i>

16:15.542 --> 16:17.542
<i>Well, I am
much prettier than you.</i>

16:17.544 --> 16:19.010
<i>Oh!</i>

16:19.012 --> 16:22.013
<i>Try to chant</i>
<i>in tune, milady.</i>

16:22.015 --> 16:23.481
Singing "Soldier, Soldier,
Will You Marry Me?"

16:23.483 --> 16:25.249
♪ Soldier, soldier,
will you marry me ♪

16:25.251 --> 16:28.353
♪ With your musket,
fife, and drum? ♪

16:28.355 --> 16:31.089
♪ Oh, how can I marry
such a pretty girl as you ♪

16:31.091 --> 16:33.224
♪ When I have no hat
to put on? ♪

16:33.226 --> 16:37.462
♪ And off to the haberdasher
she did go ♪

16:37.464 --> 16:40.098
<i>♪ As fast as she could run</i>

16:40.100 --> 16:43.101
♪ She bought him a hat,
the best that there was ♪

16:43.103 --> 16:46.471
♪ And the soldier
put it on. ♪

16:47.774 --> 16:49.340
Here's someone you should meet.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.676
Major Andre, may I present
Abraham Woodhull,

16:51.678 --> 16:54.178
a trader from Long Island?

16:55.547 --> 16:59.484
Major Andre. It's an
honor to meet you, sir.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.319
Gird yourself for battle,
Mr. Woodhull.

17:01.321 --> 17:05.156
We plan to give Dionysus a
spirited contest for his crown.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.656
They are, of course,
ahead of us.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.593
Each man is budgeted
for one bottle of champagne,

17:08.595 --> 17:11.061
three bottles of wine during,
and one bottle of port after.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.065
One's glass
must always be full.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.733
So you're our man
on Long Island?

17:15.734 --> 17:17.667
Oh, Woodhull.
Abraham Woodhull.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.738
<i>- Challenge!</i>
<i>- Challenge!</i>

17:20.740 --> 17:22.140
Colonel Cook.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.340
Oh, don't dare to dream

17:23.343 --> 17:25.542
you can outbumper me,
young man.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.246
Answer my challenge
and we'll bumper together.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.347
Oh!

17:29.349 --> 17:31.416
Who would you kill...

17:31.418 --> 17:34.619
if there were no repercussions
and you could get away clean?

17:34.621 --> 17:38.222
You, for positing a challenge
worthy of a first-rate tonker.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.828
Yeah, bumper!

17:43.830 --> 17:45.596
Oh, oh!

17:47.367 --> 17:50.268
Now answer your own frivolous thrust.
Who would you kill?

17:50.270 --> 17:53.137
George Washington, so we
can end this bloody war.

17:53.139 --> 17:55.440
Kiss-ass!

17:57.810 --> 18:00.278
One hopes that
Lieutenant Gracely

18:00.280 --> 18:01.712
<i>won't hit his mark too soon.</i>

18:01.714 --> 18:04.615
There's profit to be
made in this bloody war.

18:04.617 --> 18:08.553
Oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.822
How can I be of assistance?

18:10.824 --> 18:12.690
<i>The army needs fuel,</i>

18:12.692 --> 18:16.694
and coal from Durham and South
Wales is too expensive to ship.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.496
Cordwood will suffice,

18:18.498 --> 18:20.364
and the orchards on Long
Island are a rich source.

18:20.366 --> 18:24.435
Understood.
Uh, what's the going rate?

18:24.437 --> 18:28.873
By requisition, the desired
rate is zero, naturally.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.342
<i>That's why the war helps us</i>

18:31.344 --> 18:33.778
<i>as regards to those</i>
<i>we brand rebels.</i>

18:33.780 --> 18:36.881
Confiscation eschews
compensation.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.817
Don't we have to wait

18:39.819 --> 18:43.354
until the rebels in question
are proven guilty?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.623
Guilt is relative.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.494
Whatever proof we don't
have can be adjusted.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.497
You provide the names,

18:52.499 --> 18:54.699
we provide the attainders.

18:54.701 --> 18:56.367
I see,

18:56.369 --> 18:58.703
To the spoils of war.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.139
Indeed.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.306
Don't drink that yet!

19:04.310 --> 19:05.910
Oh, relax, relax.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.880
Just a little ritual
mischief for the initiate.

19:08.882 --> 19:12.150
You can get me back later.

19:12.152 --> 19:15.153
I certainly hope so.

19:15.155 --> 19:18.589
On three, two, one!

19:32.839 --> 19:35.606
<i>Get down!</i>

19:40.846 --> 19:43.214
Get him under cover!

20:16.915 --> 20:18.849
Ah!

20:22.521 --> 20:25.523
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Trying to save you.

20:25.525 --> 20:28.726
I meant for us to meet at the
Elizabeth Town Tavern, all right?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.995
Don't you know a trap
when you see one?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.830
You're welcome, Brewster.

20:32.832 --> 20:37.802
Well, you wanted Rogers, right?
You got him.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.547
Go on.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.622
Excuse me, Corporal.

20:57.624 --> 21:01.826
Did a young woman with brown hair
wearing a coral dress come by yet?

21:01.828 --> 21:04.028
Coral?
You mean like pink?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.663
Mm.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.465
Not that I've seen.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.033
Oh, she's late.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.336
The major won't be pleased.
Won't be pleased at all.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.413
No shame in casting up
one's accounts.

21:22.415 --> 21:26.417
I suggest you use your chunder
bucket early and often.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.319
It's the only way
to survive the night.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.521
<i>Gentlemen. Gentlemen.</i>

21:30.523 --> 21:31.722
Gentlemen.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.592
Gentlemen, I believe
we are expecting

21:34.594 --> 21:37.928
a delivery of flowers soon.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.865
To firm erection,
fine insertion,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.500
excellent distillation, and...

21:42.502 --> 21:45.403
No contamination.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.481
Where's your pass?

21:57.483 --> 21:59.784
My...

21:59.786 --> 22:01.485
oh, no!

22:01.487 --> 22:02.820
I must have dropped it.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.356
Perhaps somewhere on the coach.

22:06.591 --> 22:09.427
It's all right.
You're expected.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.771
- Shh, shh.
- Look, girls.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.778
<i>She's in the
wrong place, isn't she?</i>

22:27.780 --> 22:29.547
Don't mind them.

22:29.549 --> 22:33.651
Plenty of eligible officers
to go around.

22:33.653 --> 22:37.088
I just have a few nervous
butterflies is all.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.790
I get them every time
I go onstage.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.993
Use them to embolden
your performance.

22:42.995 --> 22:46.797
Remember to be visible,
amenable,

22:46.799 --> 22:50.768
and most importantly, flexible.

22:50.770 --> 22:54.438

Not so fast.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.467
Would you do me the honor
of being my partner?

23:57.135 --> 23:59.470
The pleasure would be mine.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.167
You promised
me you'd stay behind.

24:34.806 --> 24:37.041
Promises get broken.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.959
You should wait before
you do something reckless.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.529
I waited for you when we were
engaged and that all went to hell.

25:01.032 --> 25:04.134
I waited to get Selah
released and now he's gone.

25:05.070 --> 25:08.239
I'm done waiting.

25:11.209 --> 25:13.611
Major Andre.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.980
A word in private?

25:22.688 --> 25:24.288
He fired on the exchange?

25:24.290 --> 25:27.725
With no regard for the
prisoners or the proceeding.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.761
After Washington's letter regarding
the ill treatment of prisoners,

25:30.763 --> 25:34.598
even General Howe will see fit
to rein in his favorite cur.

25:34.600 --> 25:38.569
Robert Rogers showed no discipline,
no respect for the rule of law.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.138
His arrogance does
a disservice to us all.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.911
How soon can you be back
in neutral territory?

25:46.913 --> 25:48.646
It's just over
two hours' hard ride.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.581
I have fresh horses
standing by.

25:52.117 --> 25:56.720
I'm giving you permission
to kill him if he resists.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.259
I need a squirrel.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.594
Eh?

26:03.596 --> 26:06.630
Their brains...

26:06.632 --> 26:08.799
...help to heal
the wound.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.568
I'll go get one.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.936
Don't forget your musket.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.638
I don't need it.

26:22.013 --> 26:25.015
Tell me about my brother.

26:30.288 --> 26:32.823
He's got a right
to know, Selah.

26:40.765 --> 26:44.201
The Jersey...

26:44.203 --> 26:46.070
was hell.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.675
<i>We had to fight for food,</i>
<i>air to breathe.</i>

26:52.877 --> 26:55.312
We became animals.

26:55.314 --> 26:58.082
We cursed God, all of us...

26:59.250 --> 27:01.251
except Samuel.

27:01.253 --> 27:05.723
<i>Your brother</i>
<i>prayed every night.</i>

27:05.725 --> 27:08.125
<i>Convinced me to pray, too.</i>

27:08.127 --> 27:10.327
<i>To fight.</i>

27:11.129 --> 27:13.797
<i>We protected each other.</i>

27:14.966 --> 27:17.735
<i>But I couldn't</i>
<i>protect him from dysentery.</i>

27:22.340 --> 27:27.344
When it was done, I was the one
who carried Samuel above deck.

27:28.947 --> 27:32.816
<i>I prayed his soul go to heaven</i>

27:32.818 --> 27:35.953
and sent his body to the sea.

27:40.792 --> 27:44.728
Hey, at least
he's at peace now, Ben.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.366
Peace?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.168
What peace?

27:52.804 --> 27:55.973
My brother died like a dog...

27:56.908 --> 27:59.910
with everything
stripped from him.

27:59.912 --> 28:03.681
And now, even in death,
Rogers...

28:03.683 --> 28:08.118
he steals his name
to set a trap for me?

28:14.225 --> 28:17.127
He dies tonight.

28:31.209 --> 28:34.912
It means "brave one," "warrior."

28:34.914 --> 28:37.281
- <i>What?</i>
<i>- My name.</i>

28:37.283 --> 28:39.817
And what's the name
for "quiet one"?

28:39.819 --> 28:42.352
<i>You've forgotten, eh?</i>

28:42.354 --> 28:45.055
That boy's a good shot.

28:46.091 --> 28:49.960
Hit his target from horseback.

28:51.362 --> 28:52.896
You like him.

28:52.898 --> 28:56.500
War makes brothers of us all.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.770
It's the boy's right
to avenge his brother.

28:59.772 --> 29:03.440
And it's my right
to avenge mine.

29:15.787 --> 29:17.955
We should get away

29:17.957 --> 29:21.458
from all this...
formality

29:21.460 --> 29:24.461
to a place where
we can be alone.

29:36.141 --> 29:39.243
This is just the first course.

29:47.352 --> 29:50.087
- I'm concerned for her.
- She's not herself.

29:50.089 --> 29:52.489
She told me she plans to steal
into the major's bedroom.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.859
He keeps a black book there
with information about the war.

29:55.861 --> 29:59.229
She forced me
to tell her about it.

30:04.068 --> 30:08.038
I'll find
my way to the bedroom.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.940
You follow at your discretion.

30:11.443 --> 30:13.510
<i>I'd kill Gracely</i>

30:13.512 --> 30:17.247
<i>for not letting me</i>
<i>court his sister.</i>

30:17.249 --> 30:18.982
I'd kill whoever
made this wine.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.118
Who do I have to murder
to get a decent claret?

30:26.991 --> 30:29.326
Shh.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.311
I have a plan.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.147
Yeah? Would you mind
filling me in?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.955
Victory or death.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.891
- No.
- It's the only option, Caleb.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.427
You're not going out
as some decoy.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.562
I won't let you die
because of me.

31:12.103 --> 31:16.006
I'm sorry about Sammy,
Tall-boy. I am.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.008
And I can't bring him
back like I promised.

31:18.010 --> 31:21.445
But I can help you get out of
these woods and back to camp.

31:28.586 --> 31:30.988
Shite.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.623
<i>Hold the line.</i>

31:32.625 --> 31:36.226
Uh, about getting you
back to camp...

31:38.429 --> 31:41.431
Whoa. Whoa.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.933
We know you're there.

31:42.935 --> 31:46.069
<i>We followed the report</i>
<i>of your guns.</i>

31:46.071 --> 31:49.106
This standoff
must cease and desist

31:49.108 --> 31:51.608
by order of Major John Andre.

31:51.610 --> 31:55.445
<i>Both parties</i>
<i>must put aside their arms</i>

31:55.447 --> 31:57.414
and come down!

32:32.350 --> 32:33.984
Get out of here.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.552
Weir is coming and...

32:40.525 --> 32:44.361
Now you'll take me?

32:44.363 --> 32:47.030
Out of what, jealousy?

32:47.032 --> 32:48.699
If you'd married me, none
of this would've happened.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.067
Mm.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.668
But you're afraid
to act from your heart.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.204
You're a coward
who lives for caution,

32:54.206 --> 32:56.139
afraid of your own shad...

32:58.476 --> 33:00.610
Uh-oh.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.747
Didn't expect I'd get you
back quite so soon, eh? Eh?

33:03.749 --> 33:07.217
Don't worry, you can have a
taste of this bun if you like,

33:07.219 --> 33:09.319
now that it's been buttered.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.089
I will not be
played for a fool.

33:16.260 --> 33:19.029
- Now look what you've done.
- Where's the book?

33:28.172 --> 33:32.309
I want your backwater scab
out of here now.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.514
You can't possibly
understand a word of it.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.650
It's a code key, all right?
The same as ours.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.186
Ben will be able
to decipher it.

33:52.630 --> 33:54.297
Abraham, wait.

33:54.299 --> 33:56.800
What do you think you're doing?

33:56.802 --> 33:59.369
You were gonna lay with him, is that it?
Is that your plan?

33:59.371 --> 34:01.071
You would've
spread your legs for...

34:01.073 --> 34:03.173
I don't care what happens
to my body, not anymore.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.609
Well, neither do I.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.144
Is this man bothering you?

34:07.146 --> 34:09.446
<i>Me?</i>

34:09.447 --> 34:11.681
I think that you'd find, sir,
that the bother was mine.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.817
<i>All right?</i>
<i>She's dry as dust.</i>

34:13.819 --> 34:17.454
I suggest you chuck her back in
the trough with the rest of them.

34:17.456 --> 34:20.824
There is a line, sir,
and you've crossed it.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.360
Time for you to retire.

34:32.838 --> 34:36.239
Mr. Woodhull
will be leaving us.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.674
He can't leave yet. He hasn't
answered the challenge.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.309
There is no challenge for him.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.411
I've stopped that game.
I'll see myself out.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.280
- The challenge must be answered!
- I'll see myself out.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.181
- Please.
- The challenge must be answered.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.516
Who would you kill?
We demand your answer.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.570
Ahem.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.846
I would ki...

35:17.882 --> 35:20.750
I would kill the man
who killed my brother.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.688
Well, I am piqued.
Carry on.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.223
All right.

35:26.225 --> 35:29.159
You'll all remember
the Liberty Pole riots

35:29.161 --> 35:31.194
at the commons near King's
College about three years ago.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.330
Sons of Liberty
would erect their poles

35:33.332 --> 35:36.166
and our men would tear it
down week in, week out.

35:36.168 --> 35:40.170
- Like a game.
- I was a student of the law back then.

35:40.172 --> 35:43.173
I had no time for games.

35:43.175 --> 35:45.275
Until one night
some drunken fool,

35:45.277 --> 35:47.344
he climbed up the pole,

35:47.346 --> 35:49.846
he put a Phrygian cap
on the top.

35:49.848 --> 35:53.383
<i>It was just another game,</i>

35:53.385 --> 35:57.187
to be sure, a prank.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.588
But that cap, that...

35:58.590 --> 36:00.657
that ancient

36:00.659 --> 36:04.194
Roman symbol of freedom,

36:04.196 --> 36:08.198
that was a direct
insult to our king.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.767
- Mm-hmm.
- Right.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.203
It was a prank.

36:13.205 --> 36:16.806
A prank turned a game
into a riot,

36:16.808 --> 36:19.376
a riot that my...

36:19.378 --> 36:22.612
my brother Thomas...

36:22.614 --> 36:24.314
...he came down
to put it down.

36:24.316 --> 36:28.618
He was a captain in
the king's militia back then.

36:30.221 --> 36:35.425
And he was outnumbered
by the rioters that day.

36:40.531 --> 36:42.899
I don't want the man who...

36:44.502 --> 36:47.370
who ran him through or the...

36:50.241 --> 36:52.776
the man who trampled him.

37:06.524 --> 37:09.292
I want the...

37:09.294 --> 37:11.528
the coward...

37:13.864 --> 37:16.433
who put the hat on the pole.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.805
Because without him...

37:23.774 --> 37:26.710
none of it
would've happened, so...

37:32.883 --> 37:34.818
<i>Well, that was bleak.</i>

37:42.627 --> 37:45.362
- I'm sorry, miss.
-  My dress.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.897
Let me get something
to clean it.

37:53.704 --> 37:57.774
Don't think twice
about it, Abigail.

37:57.776 --> 38:00.844
Let it go.
Thank you, Abigail.

38:21.799 --> 38:24.334
The flag of truce is a symbol

38:24.336 --> 38:28.872
that must be treated with the highest
honor and respect at all times,

38:28.874 --> 38:33.476
not the least of which during a
sanctioned exchange of prisoners.

38:33.478 --> 38:36.546
As representatives of His Excellency,
General George Washington,

38:36.548 --> 38:39.049
we do concur and abide
by this tradition.

38:39.051 --> 38:42.085
That man is not
who he pretends to be.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.888
May I see your papers, sir?

38:57.902 --> 39:00.637
Are you Samuel Tallmadge?

39:01.605 --> 39:04.574
Yes, I am.

39:04.576 --> 39:08.878
This man is my only brother,

39:08.880 --> 39:10.980
<i>Captain Samuel Tallmadge,</i>

39:10.982 --> 39:14.617
imprisoned on the Jersey
these past six months.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.052
So confirmed.

39:17.988 --> 39:20.590
I place these three men
under my protection,

39:20.592 --> 39:22.525
and you, Major,

39:22.527 --> 39:25.729
<i>have orders to report</i>
<i>to Major Andre at once.</i>

39:27.465 --> 39:31.134
There is no place on this continent
that you can hide from me.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.670
Oh, I won't be hiding.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.874
Tallmadge.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.745
One good hat deserves another.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.485
- A petition?
- Yes.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.986
A local is helping me
track it down.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.689
Judge Woodhull was
looking for a petition,

39:52.691 --> 39:56.860
<i>one that named Selah Strong as
a delegate to an illegal body.</i>

39:56.862 --> 39:58.495
Selah Strong?

40:00.030 --> 40:01.898
Even with this petition,

40:01.900 --> 40:06.102
we would need more hard evidence
there are rebels in our midst.

40:07.438 --> 40:08.872
See to it.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.641
Quietly.

40:12.843 --> 40:14.711
Of course, sir.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.636
<i>You started the riots?</i>

40:40.871 --> 40:43.773
Who else knows?

40:45.843 --> 40:47.911
Just you.
