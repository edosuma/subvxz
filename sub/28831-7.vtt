WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:03.380
-So it's over with Jeff?
-Yes.

00:04.420 --> 00:07.080
But would you ever date
a woman who was plus-size?

00:07.080 --> 00:08.290
Sure.

00:08.290 --> 00:10.420
Have you ever dated anyone

00:10.420 --> 00:12.880
who's over, say, a size two?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.040
(phone dings)

00:17.830 --> 00:20.620
Jamie:
I didn't want Gael
to feel weird,

00:20.620 --> 00:22.290
but I bought one
of his pieces.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.290
You sure it looks
good there?

00:23.290 --> 00:24.830
Yeah, it looks great.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.790
Gael:
So, this is the first piece
in a series I'm gonna do

00:27.790 --> 00:30.920
based on the piece that I sold
in the previous show.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.830
"Bold AF L.A. artist

00:32.830 --> 00:36.040
everyone will be talking about
if they aren't already."

00:36.040 --> 00:37.460
Gael (laughing):
Are you kidding me?

00:37.460 --> 00:38.880
In Black Lives Matter,

00:38.880 --> 00:40.580
we understand
it's a whole system.

00:40.580 --> 00:42.750
Malika:
Well, I really wanna be
a part of the transformation,

00:42.750 --> 00:44.000
not just the response.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.250
I don't have time to reign in
the ego of a young lawyer

00:46.250 --> 00:49.380
who's got something to prove
because she failed the bar.

00:49.380 --> 00:52.420
I wanted to talk
to you about dating.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.580
What if I helped you
set up your profile?

00:54.580 --> 00:57.830
We cannot afford to have
another Amanda situation.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.460
I just asked if you would spend
the night with Jamie.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.670
Yeah, maybe I'll move in
with Jamie.

01:00.670 --> 01:01.880
-Go right ahead.
-Okay.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.830
-Stop!
-(screams)

01:03.830 --> 01:04.830
So, why don't you?

01:06.290 --> 01:07.580
What?

01:07.580 --> 01:09.210
Move in with me?

Yeah, what's going on?

01:53.290 --> 01:55.880
You said you wanted to be
part of an action, right?

01:57.000 --> 01:58.460
-Yeah.
-Oh.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.710
We've been hacked before.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.210
All right, y'all,
so let's get started.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.040
So, I know some of you are
wondering why we're here,

02:14.040 --> 02:16.170
and we apologize
for the secrecy.

02:17.620 --> 02:20.620

02:22.380 --> 02:24.710

we have to keep
the plan under wraps,

02:27.620 --> 02:28.960
even from some of you.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.580
So, you're gonna get details
on a need-to-know basis only.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.710
Now, new folks...

02:35.710 --> 02:38.080
We gonna need you
on the front lines
for this one.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.920
Police don't know your faces
the way they know some of ours,

02:40.920 --> 02:42.880
and so you will be given
more access.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.920
If you are uncomfortable
with this in any way,

Here's all the research
on landlord retaliation
in California.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.710
Uh, since the law isn't settled,

03:20.710 --> 03:23.000
did you get a chance to look
at the Nevada case I sent you?

03:23.000 --> 03:23.960
Yep.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.170
-Hope it was helpful.
-Uh-huh.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.080
I just wanna say, um...

03:29.080 --> 03:32.250
If there's anything else
I can help with,
in addition to research,

03:32.250 --> 03:33.880
I'd love an opportunity
to do more.

03:34.830 --> 03:35.830
Okay.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.210
Actually, I'm going out
in the field today

03:42.210 --> 03:44.000
for the expungement clinic.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.250
Can you sort these files
by expungement type

03:48.250 --> 03:50.920
and review them for potential
eligibility by end of day?

03:52.290 --> 03:53.790
-Sure.
-Thank you.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.620
I thought we agreed
to take the first deal
in the Rivera case.

03:57.620 --> 03:58.920
Yeah, I think
we can do better.

03:58.920 --> 04:00.500
-And if we don't?
-I'm just gonna...

04:00.500 --> 04:02.290
-Then it's on me.
-And me!

04:02.290 --> 04:05.170
-It's my case, Teresa.
-And this is my office, Marcus.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.540
Are Mommy and Zaddy
fighting again?

04:08.920 --> 04:10.120
What is the deal with them?

04:10.120 --> 04:12.330
I heard Marcus was
up for a promotion

04:12.330 --> 04:13.920
at another legal aid office,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.670
and Teresa put
the big kibosh on it.

04:15.670 --> 04:18.750
Yeah, well I heard
Teresa's on her way out,

04:18.750 --> 04:20.250
and Marcus is getting her job.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.080
Oh. I thought maybe
they had a thing.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.670
-Oh, that too.
-Oh, for sure.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.120
Marcus:
We'll finish
this conversation later.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.210
Hey, Cary, I could use
some help in the field today.

04:30.210 --> 04:31.920
-You wanna come?
-Sure!

04:31.920 --> 04:33.000
Let's go.

04:36.830 --> 04:39.120
Callie,
since Cary's out,

04:39.120 --> 04:40.920
how would you like to do
a client intake today?

04:40.920 --> 04:43.080
Um, I'd love to,

04:43.080 --> 04:45.250
but Marcus needs
these files sorted ASAP.

04:45.250 --> 04:46.710
Don't worry about Marcus.

04:46.710 --> 04:47.920
He works for me.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.960
(mouths)

04:54.830 --> 04:56.420
Evan:
In light of
the negative publicity

04:56.420 --> 04:58.750
surrounding the gender
pay gap at Speckulate,

04:58.750 --> 05:01.170
the board thinks that
launching an activism app

05:01.170 --> 05:03.750
before the end of the quarter
would be some good PR for us.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.420
-When is the end
of the quarter?
-Ten days.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.750
Ten days?

05:09.750 --> 05:11.080
That's gonna be tight.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.500
You can do it.

05:18.210 --> 05:22.290
Black women are trendsetters
and brand loyalists, and yet,
so many companies

05:22.290 --> 05:24.250
ignore us
in their marketing.

05:24.250 --> 05:27.170
And that is why I love
what you are doing here

05:27.170 --> 05:28.460
at Panoptic Threads.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.000
We're all about inclusivity.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
We want our clients
to be every woman,

05:32.000 --> 05:33.830
every race, religion,

05:33.830 --> 05:35.040
socioeconomic group.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.290
-Binary and non-binary.
-True.

05:37.290 --> 05:40.290
You don't have
to identify as female
to find your fashion here.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.420
That sounds amazing.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.920
Tiana:
What would you be doing there?

05:44.920 --> 05:47.120
I'd be a marketing analyst
advising the company

05:47.120 --> 05:48.920
on cultural awareness

05:48.920 --> 05:51.620
and how to avoid promoting
harmful stereotypes and imagery.

05:51.620 --> 05:54.330
Like blackface turtlenecks.

05:54.330 --> 05:55.580
(chuckling): Exactly.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.460
For my college thesis,
I did a case study

05:57.460 --> 05:59.290
on unconscious bias in hiring.

05:59.290 --> 06:01.040
So, when I was applying
for jobs...

06:01.040 --> 06:03.750
I sent identical resumes
to 20 different companies,

06:03.750 --> 06:05.330
half with my real name

06:05.330 --> 06:07.330
and half with the name
Melanie Watson.

06:07.330 --> 06:10.170
"Melanie" got three responses
right away.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.170
Of course she did.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.040
Whereas you're
the only company

06:13.040 --> 06:15.080
who responded
to Malika Williams.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.960
I love that you did that.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.790
This is exactly
the kind of bias

06:19.790 --> 06:21.330
that we want to eradicate
with our brand.

06:21.330 --> 06:23.670
And I want to be a part
of that mission,

06:23.670 --> 06:24.620
and this company.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.420
We need to discuss it
with the team,

06:28.420 --> 06:30.500
but you're exactly
what we're looking for.

06:32.880 --> 06:35.880
I just-- I really hope
I get it.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.460
Not that I don't get
how important

06:38.460 --> 06:40.420
the invisible work
we are doing here is,

06:40.420 --> 06:42.080
but I miss being
on the front lines

06:42.080 --> 06:43.620
like I was
during Jamal's trial.

06:43.620 --> 06:47.120
The charge you get when you can
feel you're stirring things up.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.960
I think I could get that feeling
every day at this job.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.250
That's dope.

06:51.250 --> 06:52.750
I do not get that feeling

06:52.750 --> 06:54.500
working at the Department
of Water and Power.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.210
(both laughing)

06:58.580 --> 07:01.250
Thomas:
This is where they would like
the piece to live.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.290
They want something abstract
using earthy materials,

07:05.290 --> 07:07.120
which is why, when I saw
that piece on you

07:07.120 --> 07:10.040
in the KickinLA profile,
I wanted to bring you in.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.670
Thanks, man, I appreciate it.

07:11.670 --> 07:16.120
Um, I've never done
anything large scale before.

07:16.120 --> 07:19.120
-So you're not interested?
-No. Very interested.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.750
Uh, when would you need
to see some sketches?

07:20.750 --> 07:22.330
Well, we're moving quickly.

07:22.330 --> 07:25.330
Could you present something
to the client at five o'clock
tomorrow?

07:26.290 --> 07:27.500
Tomorrow?

07:29.670 --> 07:30.460
Sure.

07:37.210 --> 07:39.080
-Are you cooking?
-No.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.290
I miss your cooking.

07:41.290 --> 07:44.880
Well, you shouldn't have taken
away my mini-fridge.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.210
Sorry, dude,
people were complaining

07:47.210 --> 07:48.920
about the electric bill.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.880
-You look tired.
-Thanks.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.540
I'm having breakfast for dinner,
so I made coffee.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.380
Oh, thank you.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.380
Um, has anyone seen my mug?
It's pink and...

08:06.580 --> 08:07.830
-Ah.
-Oh.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.580
Sorry, I didn't realize
it was your mug,

08:10.580 --> 08:12.710
being that this is
communal living and all.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.500
It's got my name
on the bottom.

08:15.580 --> 08:16.580
Huh.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.420
Is it magical or something?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.120
No, it's just better
for my tea diffuser.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.210
-It's fine.
-Great. Thanks.

08:28.210 --> 08:30.000
I have to run anyway, so...

08:32.750 --> 08:34.830
The other 50 mugs aren't
good enough for Elsa?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.580
Was it something I said?

08:46.250 --> 08:47.830
He's mad I took
away his mini-fridge,

08:47.830 --> 08:49.620
(whispers):
and I feel bad lying about it.

08:49.620 --> 08:51.460
Yeah, but
I really appreciate it.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.080
He needed to get
out of his loft.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.250
You're awfully concerned
about him lately.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.670
No, I'm not.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.670
Your song at Malika's birthday
was incredible.

08:59.670 --> 09:02.330
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you two are in love.

09:04.420 --> 09:05.880
I'm kidding!

09:07.120 --> 09:08.790
-No. You're not in love.
-(sobs)

09:08.790 --> 09:10.290
You are in love?

09:11.540 --> 09:13.620
-(crying)
-He's in love,
and you're in like?

09:13.620 --> 09:16.120
-(crying)
-It's not you, it's him?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.210
(crying)

09:18.210 --> 09:19.670
It's not him, it's you?

09:22.210 --> 09:23.210
It's me?

09:29.040 --> 09:30.210
So, you do love Dennis?

09:32.790 --> 09:34.330
But you never broke up
with Jeff?

09:35.500 --> 09:38.380
Because he finally left
his wife for you,

09:38.380 --> 09:41.330
and now you feel bad for dumping
him when his life is a mess?

09:42.580 --> 09:43.620
No?

09:43.620 --> 09:45.460
I was on a roll there.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.830
That's what I told myself.

09:46.830 --> 09:49.250
But the truth is
I didn't break up with him,

09:49.250 --> 09:52.420
because I didn't think that
anyone else would ever love me.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.080
Well, how do you know
Dennis doesn't love you?

09:54.080 --> 09:56.750
(sniffles)
I know that he loves me.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.330
As a friend.

09:59.330 --> 10:00.960
(sniffles)
But let's face it,

10:01.880 --> 10:03.000
I'm not his type, you know?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.620
He dates girls with waists
the size of my thighs.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.500
-First of all,
you're beautiful.
-Well, duh!

10:08.500 --> 10:10.290
I said I was fat, not ugly.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.290
Just because I learned
to love my body

10:13.290 --> 10:14.790
doesn't mean
that Dennis ever could.

10:15.380 --> 10:18.080
-Jeff does.
-(sighs)

10:19.210 --> 10:20.250
Sorry.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.380
Sorry, I just meant
that your body is

10:22.380 --> 10:24.420
-obviously lovable.
-(sniffles)

10:25.920 --> 10:27.460
(crying):
Jeff's in town.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.420
Oh.

10:30.420 --> 10:33.170
Well, if you don't love him,
you have to tell him.

10:37.420 --> 10:39.500
(crying):
I'm so sorry.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.420
I never saw this coming.

10:44.620 --> 10:47.710
-If I had, I never--
-Would let me blow up
my entire life?

10:55.500 --> 10:56.920
I lost my house...

10:58.380 --> 11:01.210
my dog,
all of my friends.

11:01.960 --> 11:04.080
-I know.
-My family hates me.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.460
I'm sorry.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.920
But I didn't ruin
your marriage.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.330
You weren't happy
with Lily.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.960
And with or without me,

11:14.960 --> 11:16.620
you needed to end things.

11:18.710 --> 11:20.830
(crying):
You're an amazing man.

11:23.290 --> 11:27.120
And you deserve someone
who loves you and makes
you happy.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.580
-And when you find
that person--
-Just get out.

11:34.420 --> 11:36.420
-Jeff--
-Just get the hell out!

11:41.120 --> 11:43.120
Okay. That was hard.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.420
But you survived.

11:46.710 --> 11:49.460
I mean, what do you have
to lose by telling Dennis?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.330
His friendship.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.170
(sniffles)

12:01.040 --> 12:03.420
-When do we celebrate?
-Well, I didn't get the job yet.

12:03.420 --> 12:04.750
Uh, yes, you did.
Stop frontin'.

12:04.750 --> 12:08.080
Also, what is their policy
on boyfriends?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.790
Can I still hang out
and watch you work?

12:09.790 --> 12:12.830
Aw. I am gonna
miss these drop-ins.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.790
Seems like the only way
I can catch you these days.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.380
I'll find a way
to make time for us.

12:17.580 --> 12:18.920
I promise.

12:20.330 --> 12:22.960
Seriously, though, I'm...
I'm proud of you.

12:23.580 --> 12:24.580
Thank you.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.120
Tolu:
Yo, what's
that company's name?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.750
Panoptic Threads. Why?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.500
Some chick from there
just liked

12:33.500 --> 12:34.880
one of your tweets
that I'm tagged in.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.080
Which one?

12:36.080 --> 12:39.500
"Club goin' up on a Tuesday"
with a pic of us and Rick.

12:42.460 --> 12:43.790
Malika:
Wait, that's old.

12:43.790 --> 12:46.000
They are deep diving
into my socials.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.880
Oh, Malika, that just means
they're interested in you.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.710
Well, I'm interested
in, uh, who's Rick.

12:49.710 --> 12:51.920
-Calm down,
that's just Tolu's bong.
-Rest in peace.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.580
(both laughing)

12:54.580 --> 12:57.000
And it means I need
to do some scrubbing.

12:58.790 --> 13:00.920
♪ I am everything I need ♪

13:00.920 --> 13:03.330

13:03.330 --> 13:05.330

13:06.620 --> 13:09.120
-Hi.
-Hey! We weren't
sure you'd make it.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.620
I got you a drink,
but I drank it.

13:11.620 --> 13:14.290
(chuckles)
Yeah, well, I wasn't sure
I was gonna make it ether.

13:16.670 --> 13:17.670
(phone chimes)

13:22.040 --> 13:23.040
Crap.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.460
(gasps)
Oh!

13:28.460 --> 13:30.330
Sorry, I wear orthotics.

13:31.790 --> 13:34.250
-What?
-They make my shoes squeak.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.540
(shoes squeaking)

13:41.210 --> 13:42.620
People usually hear
me approaching.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.330
Uh, well, sorry. Uh...

13:46.330 --> 13:47.580
I must've...

13:47.580 --> 13:49.080
I'm really deep in it
with, you know,

13:49.080 --> 13:50.620
ten days to launch and all.

13:50.620 --> 13:51.880
Yes. About that.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.420
So, I want you to create
a chat feature

13:54.420 --> 13:57.380
to keep users in the app longer
and boost ad sales.

13:57.380 --> 14:01.710
-You mean like further down
the road after we've launched?
-No, I mean now.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.620
But don't worry, you can have
until end of day tomorrow
to show me something.

14:06.670 --> 14:09.580
Tomorrow? That's...
not much time.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.710
You can do it.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.460
-Well, with everything
that we already have--
-You can do it.

14:14.290 --> 14:16.460
-It's just, it's
gonna be pretty--
-You can do it.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.080
Claire:
I hope you said
we can't do it.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.580
I... didn't.

14:25.580 --> 14:27.620
But I am.
I'm just gonna tell him no.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.080
Good luck with that.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.790
Evan Speck?
Yeah, he doesn't take
no for an answer.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.040
-Who is she?
-That's Amanda.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.620
She used to work
at Speckulate.

14:41.170 --> 14:42.960
Alex:
You remember the other
pretty engineer girl?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.920
-Amanda.
-Sam: Amanda, right.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.670
Evan took an interest in her,

14:46.670 --> 14:48.290
-and then, poof!
-Her app was toast.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.580
That's Amanda?

14:51.580 --> 14:53.960
♪ I am everything I want ♪

14:53.960 --> 14:56.000
♪ I am, I am ♪

15:04.710 --> 15:08.290
The bartenders have been
ignoring this side of the bar
for like 20 minutes.

15:08.290 --> 15:10.670
I'm in too deep,
but you can save yourself.

15:10.670 --> 15:13.250
(chuckles)
No, I think we're
in this together now.

15:13.250 --> 15:14.080
(chuckles)

15:14.080 --> 15:16.710
We didn't really meet.
I'm Mariana.

15:16.710 --> 15:17.880
Nice to meet you.
I'm Amanda.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.500
Yeah. I know.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.790
You used to work at Speckulate.

15:20.790 --> 15:22.210
Yeah. Unfortunately.

15:22.210 --> 15:25.540
-But you quit.
-No. I wish.
I was fired.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.330
Fired?

15:28.330 --> 15:30.670
So what happened with Amanda?

15:30.670 --> 15:32.040
Amanda quit.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.790
But not because
Evan did anything.

15:35.620 --> 15:38.790
-May I ask why?
-Honestly, I have no idea.

15:38.790 --> 15:41.000
She took advantage
of his mentorship.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.380
Developed her app,

15:42.380 --> 15:44.960
and she got
a better offer and left.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.040
I really thought Evan liked me.

15:49.170 --> 15:50.580
And my app.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.540
He was always really supportive.

15:53.830 --> 15:55.710
The only thing
I can think of is that

15:55.710 --> 15:58.080
I told him I couldn't do
everything he wanted

15:58.080 --> 15:59.580
and still meet the deadline.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.330
And the next thing I know,
I was called into HR,

16:03.330 --> 16:05.750
and Angela was telling me
that they were letting me go.

16:06.830 --> 16:10.040
Even though
she burned Evan,
he didn't want to sue her.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.500
He got a lot of crap
from the board of directors,

16:12.500 --> 16:14.620
which is why he can't
let it happen again.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.000
I'm so sorry.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.750
At least they let
me keep my app.

16:18.790 --> 16:20.960
But I haven't been able to get
any investors interested,

16:20.960 --> 16:24.750
and I still don't have
another job.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.670
This just doesn't sound
like Evan.

16:26.670 --> 16:28.830
Yeah, that's what
I used to think.

16:28.830 --> 16:30.460
But it's his company.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.710
I wouldn't have been fired
if that's not what he wanted.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

16:47.920 --> 16:48.830
Looks good.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.420
You can look at it
when I get a copyright.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.750
(chuckles)
Never letting that one go,
are you?

16:55.750 --> 16:56.830
I'm just saying.

16:56.830 --> 16:58.710
Inspiration is not
appropriation.

16:58.710 --> 17:00.040
(laughing)
Okay.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.330
I don't remember getting
an inspired-by credit

17:02.330 --> 17:03.670
on your college thesis.

17:04.579 --> 17:05.619
You really trying to go
there right now?

17:06.880 --> 17:07.670
No.

17:08.670 --> 17:09.670
Hmm.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.250
Thanks for being cool
about staying in tonight.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.750
Of course. This commission
could be huge for you.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.920
It's barely any money.
I'll probably end up spending
more on materials anyway.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.290
It's not about the money.
It's about the exposure.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.790
Think about all
of the potential clients

17:23.790 --> 17:25.790
that will walk through
that lobby every single day

17:25.790 --> 17:27.790
and look at art
with your name on it.

17:27.790 --> 17:29.670
I'm not gonna let
you downplay this.

17:29.670 --> 17:30.830
It's huge!

17:30.830 --> 17:32.170
(chuckles)
Okay.

17:38.380 --> 17:39.830
-(Gael sighs)
-What's up?

17:39.830 --> 17:41.790
Come on, we gotta
go back to work.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.000
-Why?
-We're adding
the chat feature.

17:47.830 --> 17:49.250
(groans)

17:49.250 --> 17:51.420
-Now, let's go, come on!
-Now?

17:51.420 --> 17:54.920
Mariana needs graphics for a new
feature to the app by tomorrow.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.580
Tell her no.
You have sketches to finish.

17:57.580 --> 17:59.380
-It's my job.
-Your day job.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.210
Well, my day job isn't
making art.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.460
Yet.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.830
I have to. It's fine.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.830
And I can get it all done
if you stop distracting me.

18:12.670 --> 18:13.710
-Go!
-(laughs)

18:20.960 --> 18:23.420
Yeah, I have some work
I have to finish, too.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.880
(water running)

18:46.420 --> 18:49.420
So, that song you sang
with Davia?

18:49.420 --> 18:50.960
So intense.

18:52.000 --> 18:52.880
Very nice.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.880
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think the two of you
were in love.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.670
Okay, look, I don't have
time for this BS.

19:08.670 --> 19:10.170
Do you have feelings
for Davia?

19:22.920 --> 19:26.170
Maybe, just maybe,
you should keep
your cup in your room.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.710
Well, then Mariana
will just take it.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.880
I thought living
with four siblings

19:29.880 --> 19:31.500
on top of each other was hard,

19:31.500 --> 19:33.880
but there are people
drinking out of my cup

19:33.880 --> 19:36.920
and pissing on the toilet seats
that I don't even know.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.880
You could move in here.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.540
Where there's only one person
pissing on the toilet seat?

19:42.540 --> 19:43.710
(laughing)

19:43.710 --> 19:46.540
I am very careful,
and I have excellent aim.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.750
You haven't put it back.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.500
So glad you could
join us, Mariana.

20:07.210 --> 20:10.210
Sorry, sorry.
Let me just...

20:12.460 --> 20:13.920
Finish this...

20:14.670 --> 20:15.460
Done.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.670
Wow, this looks delicious!

20:19.670 --> 20:21.830
Either Jamie cooked
or Callie ordered in.

20:21.830 --> 20:24.250
-I can cook.
-(Jamie laughs)

20:25.880 --> 20:27.250
Okay, fine,
I ordered in,

20:27.250 --> 20:29.500
but only because
work is crazy.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.880
How so?

20:30.880 --> 20:33.000
-(infant fussing)
-So, Lisa, you said

20:33.000 --> 20:34.920
you received
an eviction notice

20:34.920 --> 20:36.620
for being in violation

20:36.620 --> 20:38.620
of the nuisance abatement
code of conduct

20:38.620 --> 20:39.880
for unapproved guests?

20:39.880 --> 20:42.210
My brother was crashing
with me for a couple of days.

20:42.210 --> 20:44.040
Him and his girl was going
through some stuff,

20:44.040 --> 20:45.290
so I offered him my couch.

20:45.290 --> 20:47.250
Did you know about
this code of conduct?

20:47.250 --> 20:49.120
Sort of.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.580
We got a letter
a few weeks back

20:50.580 --> 20:53.040
talking about how
the city filed a lawsuit

20:53.040 --> 20:55.790
against the apartment complex
for gang activity.

20:55.790 --> 20:57.500
And is your brother
in a gang?

20:58.290 --> 20:59.080
No.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.080
Neither am I
and neither are my neighbors,

21:02.080 --> 21:03.830
so I don't know what the hell
they're talking about.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.000
Are me and my kids gonna
be homeless?

21:12.830 --> 21:15.080
This intake report looks
really good, Callie.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.330
Thank you.

21:17.330 --> 21:18.790
I actually did some digging,

21:18.790 --> 21:20.540
and Lisa's not
the only tenant

21:20.540 --> 21:22.290
in her building
they're targeting.

21:22.290 --> 21:25.250
I've already found two others
from the same complex.

21:25.250 --> 21:28.250
I was wondering if we could file
a petition to intervene.

21:29.620 --> 21:32.170
Unfortunately, the matter's
already been settled in court.

21:32.170 --> 21:34.460
We can organize
a know-your-rights event,

21:34.460 --> 21:37.170
but there's not much more
we can do at this point.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.960
You remind me a lot of myself,

21:44.960 --> 21:48.540
especially at your age,
just out of law school.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.880
People dismiss
your enthusiasm,

21:50.880 --> 21:54.120
tell you you're naive to think
you can make a difference.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.290
Don't believe them.

21:56.170 --> 21:58.750
We make a difference
here every day.

21:59.670 --> 22:01.250
And when you pass
the bar next time,

22:01.250 --> 22:04.040
I hope you'll let me hire
you here as a lawyer.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.080
It felt so amazing

22:09.080 --> 22:11.080
to do actual legal work
with a client.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.210
-Not just the Constitution.
-Yeah, that sounds exciting.

22:14.210 --> 22:16.040
Yeah. Riveting.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.670
Oh, I'm sorry you have to hear
about my work for once.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.830
For once?

22:19.830 --> 22:21.830
-You always talk
about work.
-When?

22:21.830 --> 22:24.210
When I was a clerk,
I couldn't talk about my work.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.670
How many hours have I spent
listening to you talk about

22:27.670 --> 22:30.170
the broholes at Speckulate
and the spreadsheet

22:30.170 --> 22:32.080
and your socially awkward boss?

22:32.080 --> 22:33.710
Okay, he is not
that awkward.

22:33.710 --> 22:35.620
How's it going
with his dating app?

22:38.080 --> 22:39.210
It's just Jamie.
Who's he gonna tell?

22:39.210 --> 22:41.210
I'll remember that
next time I tell you a secret.

22:41.210 --> 22:43.210
Look who's talking,
Worst Keeper of Secrets Ever.

22:43.210 --> 22:45.080
So, has he been on any dates?

22:46.750 --> 22:49.210
Not yet,
but he's driving me crazy.

22:53.170 --> 22:54.960
This woman seems
to like cats.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.580
Should I tell her
about toxoplasmosis?

22:56.580 --> 22:58.210
What's that?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.790
The disease that makes people
go insane from contact
with cat feces.

23:01.750 --> 23:02.710
Please don't.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.670
So, what we're proposing is
a laddering system

23:07.670 --> 23:10.330
where salaries are leveled
by specific skill sets

23:10.330 --> 23:11.960
and job responsibilities,

23:11.960 --> 23:13.960
eliminating gender
and race bias.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.330
-So, as you can see--
-(knocking)

23:17.750 --> 23:19.000
Excuse me a moment.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.250
Sorry. Um...

23:21.250 --> 23:23.210
This woman wants to know
what I'm wearing,

23:23.210 --> 23:25.460
so do I say shirt and pants?

23:25.460 --> 23:28.710
Or is this code for something
like "Down to...

23:30.080 --> 23:31.080
sex."

23:32.920 --> 23:34.750
(toilet flushes)

23:37.670 --> 23:38.790
Sorry.

23:38.790 --> 23:41.500
How do I respond
to a GIF of a turtle?

23:43.290 --> 23:45.750
Well, you're the one
who volunteered
to help him get laid.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.620
Maybe I'll just do
it myself.

23:51.210 --> 23:52.290
-I'm kidding.
-Wow!

23:52.290 --> 23:54.580
You better not let Raj hear
you talking like that.

23:54.580 --> 23:57.710
Well, now that he knows I had
a sex dream about Evan...

23:57.710 --> 23:59.250
Hey, maybe it wasn't
an anxiety dream.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.880
Maybe you want him.

24:03.210 --> 24:06.290
Maybe I should say good night
before we start improv-ing
again.

24:06.290 --> 24:08.540
Thank you for dinner.
It was delicious.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.380
By the way,
Raj is coming over tonight.

24:10.380 --> 24:13.040
-I've been banished.
-Yeah, right,
look at this place.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.790
I mean,
the TV's bigger than my bed,

24:14.790 --> 24:16.710
there's an espresso machine
built into the wall,

24:16.710 --> 24:18.420
and this view is insane.

24:18.420 --> 24:20.540
Why would you want
to come back to our loft?

24:21.670 --> 24:23.580
You do need something
on that wall, though.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.960
Yeah, I just haven't gotten
around to it yet.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.290
Why didn't you want
Mariana to see it?

24:29.290 --> 24:32.120
Um, because she really
can't keep a secret.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.540
Why does it need
to be a secret?

24:35.710 --> 24:37.790
I don't know, you're the one
who bought it anonymously.

24:37.790 --> 24:40.000
Well, because I didn't want
Gael to feel weird about it.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.290
Like I had
some ulterior motive.

24:43.330 --> 24:44.960
Did you?

24:44.960 --> 24:46.210
No.

24:46.210 --> 24:48.420
No, I just, I...
I liked it.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.170
What did you like about it?

24:52.250 --> 24:53.250
I don't know.

24:56.420 --> 24:57.500
I guess I liked the way

24:57.500 --> 24:59.620
the male and female arms
hold each other.

25:01.710 --> 25:04.210
Like a lifeline
in a crumbling world.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.500
-That's deep.
-Oh, shut up.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.040
Do you really think Gael
will care that I bought it?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.920
It just really boosted
his confidence

25:16.920 --> 25:18.170
that he sold a piece.

25:18.170 --> 25:19.790
I don't want
to take that from him.

25:19.790 --> 25:23.580
Like you said, he might think
you had an ulterior motive.

25:23.580 --> 25:24.750
Fair enough.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.290
So, uh, you brushed
over it earlier.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.330
Have you given any more
thought to moving in here?

25:36.620 --> 25:38.670
-I have thought about it.
-Mm-hmm.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.170
And I would love
to move in with you.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.000
But?

25:51.290 --> 25:53.210
I think it might
be too soon.

25:55.580 --> 25:58.750
As much as Mariana
drives me crazy,

25:58.750 --> 26:00.830
this is probably
the last time in our lives

26:00.830 --> 26:02.670
we're gonna be able
to live together.

26:03.710 --> 26:06.420
I like that the Coterie
feels like a family.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.040
I didn't know you were
that close to anyone

26:10.040 --> 26:11.580
besides your sister.

26:11.580 --> 26:13.040
I'm close with Malika.

26:14.420 --> 26:16.330
Close-ish
with Alice and Davia.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.250
I just...

26:20.000 --> 26:21.620
I like how
it feels like home.

26:31.670 --> 26:33.330
You never came to bed.

26:34.670 --> 26:36.880
I had to get this all done.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.250
I know you're not gonna
let me see,

26:39.250 --> 26:40.960
but are your sketches ready?

26:40.960 --> 26:42.380
Yeah, I think so,

26:42.380 --> 26:44.420
but I'm just gonna have
to e-mail them to the client,

26:44.420 --> 26:47.790
because we're presenting
this chat feature
to Evan at five.

26:47.790 --> 26:49.330
Wait, are you crazy?

26:49.330 --> 26:51.880
This meeting could be
the turning point
of your career.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.330
You need to go in person
and sell your work.

26:54.330 --> 26:56.170
If they're good enough,
they should sell themselves.

26:56.170 --> 26:59.040
(scoffs)
You think that Emma Stone
shops off the rack?

26:59.040 --> 27:01.080
She doesn't wear my dress
on the red carpet

27:01.080 --> 27:02.750
because she thinks it's cool.

27:02.750 --> 27:04.420
She wears it because
she thinks I'm cool.

27:04.420 --> 27:06.380
You gotta sell them on you.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.120
And you can't do
that in an e-mail.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.210
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Just leave Mariana hanging?

27:13.330 --> 27:15.380
Sometimes to take
care of yourself,

27:15.380 --> 27:16.830
you have to let people down.

27:17.790 --> 27:19.500
She's also my friend.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.960
Even your friends.

27:28.290 --> 27:30.000
Hey, do you have
those files for me?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.920
Uh, I'm working on them now.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.460
Sorry, I was helping
with an intake.

27:34.460 --> 27:36.620
Teresa:
Relax, Marcus,
I asked her to.

27:37.710 --> 27:39.250
That's not her job.

27:39.250 --> 27:40.580
Well, you took Cary
into the field.

27:40.580 --> 27:41.880
That's not his job.

27:44.250 --> 27:45.710
Okay. Got it.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.880
Uh, Teresa, can I have a second?

27:50.880 --> 27:52.290
Yeah, what's up?

27:52.290 --> 27:55.120
Um, I know you said
we couldn't file

27:55.120 --> 27:57.330
an intervention into
the nuisance abatement suit.

27:57.330 --> 28:00.750
-Mm-hmm.
-But it looks like the owner
of the apartment complex is

28:00.750 --> 28:02.290
actually a big
development company,

28:02.290 --> 28:04.920
and they've been doing this
with other apartment buildings

28:04.920 --> 28:07.420
around the new coliseum,
trying to gentrify
the neighborhood

28:07.420 --> 28:10.460
by whatever means,
legal or otherwise.

28:10.460 --> 28:14.000
I was wondering
if we have grounds
for a class action suit.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.620
Teresa:
What they're doing is horrible.

28:15.620 --> 28:19.500
Unfortunately,
we don't have the resources
to fund a class action.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.500
But I admire your passion.
Keep up the good work.

28:29.670 --> 28:30.710
(yawns)

28:32.750 --> 28:36.080
Okay, six fully loaded lattes.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.380
(yawning):
Oh, thank God.

28:37.380 --> 28:39.580
Thank you for pitching in.

28:39.580 --> 28:41.380
-Oh, of course.
-Uh, guys.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.580
Gael just e-mailed that
he can't make the presentation,

28:43.580 --> 28:45.420
but he put everything
in the shared folder.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.580
What?

28:56.540 --> 28:57.580
Is it loading for you?

28:58.710 --> 29:00.040
No.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.960
(phone ringing)

29:14.000 --> 29:15.500
Gael.

29:16.460 --> 29:17.500
Hey.

29:18.580 --> 29:19.790
-How are you?
-Good to see you again.

29:19.790 --> 29:21.620
-This is David.
-Nice to meet you.

29:21.620 --> 29:23.500
I've heard good things.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.620
Can't wait to see
what you got for me.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.210
Just so we don't keep
you in suspense...

29:29.080 --> 29:30.080
We'd like to offer
you the job.

29:30.080 --> 29:31.420
(laughs)

29:32.580 --> 29:34.670
That's amazing.
Thank you.

29:34.670 --> 29:37.040
-We're really excited.
-So excited.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.500
There's just one issue
regarding your social media.

29:41.830 --> 29:45.500
Yeah, I wanted to tell
you that I went ahead

29:45.500 --> 29:47.460
and removed anything
that might reflect poorly

29:47.460 --> 29:49.040
on me or the company.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.670
All the evidence
of my partying days is gone.

29:53.170 --> 29:54.830
It's not the partying posts.

29:54.830 --> 29:56.830
It's the Black
Lives Matter ones.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.670
As a brand
that celebrates inclusivity,

29:59.670 --> 30:02.250
we don't want to exclude
any of our customers.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.040
-Exclude?
-Polarize.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.420
We have no problem
with you being a BLM member.

30:08.420 --> 30:09.500
We love it.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.710
We just ask, as an employee
and brand ambassador

30:12.710 --> 30:16.170
that you not post or retweet
anything BLM-related.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.790
Uh-huh.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.080
Davia!

30:33.580 --> 30:35.210
So, big news.

30:36.380 --> 30:37.380
Dennis loves you.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.040
I'm pretty sure.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.830
I slept on it,
and I'm pretty positive.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.380
Oh my God,
what did you do?

30:47.540 --> 30:49.380
Do you love Davia?

30:51.250 --> 30:52.580
As more than a friend?

30:54.290 --> 30:56.330
A simple yes or no will do.

30:56.330 --> 30:57.670
(gargling)

31:01.790 --> 31:03.170
Who wants to know?

31:04.920 --> 31:06.710
Inquiring minds?

31:06.710 --> 31:08.750
The point is, he didn't say no.

31:11.580 --> 31:13.040
Just think about it.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.000
Don't worry, I didn't say
it came from you.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.830
I'm still keeping
the mystery alive.

31:20.710 --> 31:21.960
It could be anyone.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.790
Could be me.

31:23.790 --> 31:25.330
He doesn't know that.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.710
Well, it couldn't be me.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.380
And Callie's taken.
So is Mariana.

31:37.250 --> 31:38.750
Marcus:
Can I have a word with you?

31:38.750 --> 31:39.920
In my office?

31:40.620 --> 31:41.670
Sure.

31:49.250 --> 31:52.170
I'm interested in that case
you and Teresa
are talking about.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.460
Oh, um...

31:54.460 --> 31:57.420
Teresa said Legal Aid can't
take on a class action suit.

31:57.420 --> 31:59.080
I disagree.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.620
With the right partners,
we could fund it.

32:01.790 --> 32:03.420
Well, maybe you should
talk to Teresa?

32:03.420 --> 32:06.420
Look, Teresa's good
with the day-to-day cases,

32:06.420 --> 32:08.420
but she's afraid
to take on the big stuff.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.420
But this is important.

32:10.420 --> 32:12.040
Low-income families are being
kicked out of their homes

32:12.040 --> 32:13.460
with nowhere else to go.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.920
And these developers
just move in

32:14.920 --> 32:18.620
and destroy their neighborhoods
and their businesses.

32:18.620 --> 32:20.290
Don't you need
Teresa's approval?

32:20.290 --> 32:22.380
Not on a case like this.

32:22.380 --> 32:25.170
I just need to get our director
to sign off, and I will.

32:26.580 --> 32:28.790
But we need to keep
this between us until then.

32:32.580 --> 32:34.880
You said you wanted more to do.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.460
I'm gonna need
a right hand on this.

32:38.670 --> 32:39.790
Gael:
It went great.

32:39.790 --> 32:42.080
And you were right,
it was really good.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.710
I presented my work in person,

32:43.710 --> 32:45.540
so I could answer
their questions.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.460
You think you got it?

32:47.460 --> 32:49.460
I think I'm in the running.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.960
Yeah, they said they're
gonna make a decision
in the next day or so.

32:52.790 --> 32:53.790
(phone beeps)

32:55.120 --> 32:56.920
Aah shit.
I gotta take this.
Let me call you back.

32:56.920 --> 32:58.580
(phone beeps)

32:58.580 --> 33:00.460
-Hey.
-What the hell?
Where are you?

33:00.460 --> 33:02.500
Um, sorry.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.290
- Something came up.
-Something more important
than your job?

33:05.290 --> 33:07.460
The file that you sent
isn't opening for us.

33:07.460 --> 33:10.040
Shit. All right .
I'll resend it.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.250
And I'm on my way now.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.210
I need the thumb drive
with the event archives on it.

33:16.830 --> 33:18.040
Gael, hold on a second.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.670
I need to find this thumb drive.

33:19.670 --> 33:20.710
I think I left it at Jamie's

33:20.710 --> 33:22.040
when I was there
the other night.

33:22.040 --> 33:23.710
Maybe I can get
Callie to let me in.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.170
Come on, come on, come on!

33:29.830 --> 33:31.420
Yes! Okay, Callie can let us in,

33:31.420 --> 33:32.830
but I don't have
time to go get it.

33:32.830 --> 33:33.960
I can get it.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.710
Okay, um, I will send
you the address.

33:36.710 --> 33:37.830
Blue thumb drive.

33:37.830 --> 33:39.330
I think it's
on the dining room table.

33:39.330 --> 33:40.120
Okay.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.250
I don't know how
to work for a company

33:53.250 --> 33:54.830
that sells itself
as being socially conscious,

33:54.830 --> 33:56.920
but doesn't want to be
too political or polarizing.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.830
Especially when it comes
to black liberation.

33:59.710 --> 34:00.830
I know.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.210
And pretty soon you'll be in
a place where you won't have to.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.710
But right now, you just have
to play the long game.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.000
You know how many
crappy companies I worked for
before I started my own?

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
(scoffs)
I feel you.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.920
It sucks. Feels like
you're shrinking yourself

34:12.920 --> 34:14.380
to make them feel comfortable.

34:14.380 --> 34:15.420
I know.

34:16.710 --> 34:19.210
But, baby, you have a chance

34:19.210 --> 34:20.920
to make a real change
with this job.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.830
And to succeed after everything
you've been through?

34:23.830 --> 34:26.000
I mean, that's
an act of rebellion.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.750
That's protest, baby.

-It's still not opening.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.380
What the hell, Gael?

35:00.380 --> 35:02.080
Ready to show me
what you've got?

35:03.380 --> 35:04.790
No, we're not ready.

35:07.540 --> 35:11.000
Look, I'm sorry, but I can't
launch this app in ten days

35:11.000 --> 35:13.380
and add a last-minute
chat feature

35:13.380 --> 35:14.790
and chair
the grievance committee

35:14.790 --> 35:16.920
and help certain people
with their personal life.

35:16.920 --> 35:18.830
I just-- I can't do
it all at once.

35:18.830 --> 35:20.120
So, either learn to take
no for an answer

35:20.120 --> 35:21.920
or fire me like
you did Amanda.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.580
How do you know about Amanda?

35:29.710 --> 35:31.710
You know, people talk.

35:34.830 --> 35:35.830
Well...

35:36.750 --> 35:37.920
People don't have the facts.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
(shoes squeaking)

35:52.250 --> 35:53.880
Are you a friend

I'm probably getting fired.

38:15.290 --> 38:17.580
We both might have
to move in with Jamie.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.670
Hey, can I talk to you?

38:24.580 --> 38:26.460
No, you're still dead to me.

38:26.460 --> 38:28.290
I meant Callie.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.380
Sure.

38:41.670 --> 38:44.210
-You look nice.
-Mm.

38:44.210 --> 38:46.000
I'm going for
casually sexy.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.670
Open for business
but not desperate.

38:47.670 --> 38:50.000
-What do you think?
-Who's your customer?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
(sighs)
Dennis.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.380
I'm gonna tell him how I feel.

38:54.830 --> 38:55.830
Oh my God!

38:57.000 --> 38:57.960
Because of me?

38:59.170 --> 39:00.540
I mean, I think
it's great, you know?

39:00.540 --> 39:03.250
Because like I said, you know,
I'm pretty sure he loves you.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.920
I mean, I can't guarantee,
you know,

39:05.920 --> 39:09.040
but I'm almost positive
that he does.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.670
Of course he does!

39:12.670 --> 39:14.170
(chuckling):
Obvi, you know?

39:14.170 --> 39:15.790
But sometimes you can get
like a false-positive.

39:15.790 --> 39:19.120
But not in this case.
This is 100%.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.790
(laughs nervously)

39:20.790 --> 39:22.080
You're good to go.

39:23.710 --> 39:24.500
Wow.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.080
That's, um...

39:27.080 --> 39:28.670
That's a great pep talk.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.120
Melina:
So, we know that the work
that we do is not

39:35.120 --> 39:38.040
just about some concept
of justice.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.420
This is spiritual work.
This is sacred work.

39:41.420 --> 39:44.040
These are about real people,
our people,

39:44.040 --> 39:47.710
whose bodies have been stolen
but whose spirits remain.

39:47.710 --> 39:49.830
And when we call their names,

39:49.830 --> 39:52.420
we summon in
that spiritual energy.

39:52.420 --> 39:54.080
And so we never want to forget

39:54.080 --> 39:56.080
why we're doing the work
that we're doing.

39:56.080 --> 40:00.670
And so we're gonna call the name
of Christopher Deandre Mitchell.

40:00.670 --> 40:02.960
-Can we say his name?
-Say his name!

40:02.960 --> 40:05.080
