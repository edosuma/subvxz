WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:05.739
RUSH: I may be on
 the verge of discovering

00:05.773 --> 00:09.177
the true nature of
 Destiny's mission.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.146
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.180 --> 00:13.881
Why wouldn't you
 tell anyone?

00:13.914 --> 00:17.385
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.418 --> 00:20.254
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.823
You are a good commander.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.226
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.095
RUSH: It was never about
 going home,

00:27.128 --> 00:28.696
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.729 --> 00:31.099
That is the mission.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.900
ELI: Ginn and I figured out

00:32.933 --> 00:34.902
how to dial
 the ninth chevron back

00:34.935 --> 00:36.437
to Earth while
 Destiny recharges in a star.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.005
Wait three seconds,
then follow me!

00:38.038 --> 00:39.407
RUSH: The connection was made,

00:39.440 --> 00:41.275
but you were the only one
 who made it through to Earth.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.177
You're Matthew Scott.
 And you're Ronald Greer.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.445
How do you know our names?

00:44.478 --> 00:45.546
SCOTT: I don't even know
 how this is possible.

00:45.579 --> 00:46.814
YOUNG: Their
 civilization was founded

00:46.847 --> 00:49.417
2,000 years ago by
 the crew of th Destiny.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.951
SCOTT: What's Novus?

00:50.984 --> 00:52.386
The planet where you
 founded our civilization.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.287
But then one day
 something happened,

00:53.321 --> 00:54.722
and we couldn't connect
 to Novus anymore.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.124
Will you take us home?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.291
SCOTT: You see any
 movement down there?

00:57.325 --> 00:58.926
Negative.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.162
JASON: But millions
 of people lived here.
 Where did they all go?

01:07.835 --> 01:08.769
CHLOE: Colonel?

01:11.839 --> 01:12.806
T.J.?

01:14.175 --> 01:15.008
No.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.678
It's Chloe.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.016
Where's... Where's Steven?

01:27.421 --> 01:28.356
I'm right here, Dad.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.426
Sara's on her way.
 She'll be here any minute.

01:37.498 --> 01:38.999
I'm sorry.

02:14.868 --> 02:15.869
Ash.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.211
SCOTT: We just did a recon
 of the city center.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.213
Place is completely deserted.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.215
Hard to breathe, too,
 with all the ash falling.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.982
So much for dropping
 them all off down there.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.452
I don't want
 you hanging around
 if it's too dangerous.

02:31.485 --> 02:35.456
Yes, sir, but Yaozu
 took us to the entrance
 to an underground complex.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.058
It's sort of like
 a giant fallout shelter.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.527
Who knows,
 there could be people
 holed up in there.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.894
I think we
 should check it out.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.296
Be careful. Planet's unstable.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.064
Copy that.

02:44.097 --> 02:47.067
Got a problem, though.
 Doors are sealed.
 Pretty thick, too.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.002
We tried to blast
 it open with C-4,

02:49.036 --> 02:51.372
even used
 the shuttle's weapons,
 but no luck.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.475
We can use
 Destiny's main weapon,
blow a hole in it.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.910
Yeah, and destroy
 the entire complex
 in the process.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.179
We'll dial down
 the power. 60%.

02:59.213 --> 03:02.182
The doors are pretty thick,

03:02.216 --> 03:04.918
and the actual bunker is
 way underground,
 hundreds of feet.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.854
I'd say it's worth a shot.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.558
Yeah.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.125
All right,
 give us the coordinates.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.941
I got a lock.

03:27.975 --> 03:30.578
Lieutenant,
 we are ready to fire.
 Are you clear of the area?

03:30.611 --> 03:31.479
SCOTT: Yes, sir. Fire away.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.163
Lieutenant?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.233
SCOTT: Colonel, we're on-site.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.605
Nice shooting. It worked.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.881
There's still power.
 That's a good sign.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.084
My father worked down here.
He would sometimes
bring me with him.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.621
I remember running
 through these halls
 as a child. (CHUCKLES)

04:26.199 --> 04:27.601
(MUZAK PLAYING)

04:49.490 --> 04:50.524
SCOTT: Hello?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.363
What is this room?

04:55.396 --> 04:58.298
The Teneran archive.

04:58.332 --> 05:02.370
The entire history
 of our people is stored here.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.972
Let's hope it can tell us
 what happened to them.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.721
What the hell is this?

05:20.754 --> 05:21.989
ELI: I don't know!

05:22.022 --> 05:23.023
This isn't Earth!

05:23.056 --> 05:24.725
ELI: Something
 obviously went wrong!

05:24.758 --> 05:30.631
All right,
 Greer, James, organize teams!
 We need to find shelter!

05:30.664 --> 05:32.466
Where's Telford?
 SCOTT: He didn't make it!

05:32.500 --> 05:33.734
Why? What happened to him?

05:33.767 --> 05:35.335
SCOTT: I don't know!

05:35.369 --> 05:37.337
You brought a Kino?
 ELI: I know we
 weren't supposed to...

05:37.371 --> 05:38.972
Find a planet!

05:39.006 --> 05:40.240
Can you redi Destiny?

05:40.273 --> 05:41.642
It's gone!

05:41.675 --> 05:43.377
SCOTT: All right,
 everyone, stay calm!
 Stay close!

05:44.211 --> 05:45.245
Turn this off!

05:47.681 --> 05:50.718
The first recording stored
 in the Teneran archive.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.055
2,000 years ago.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.024
I'm still trying
 to wrap my mind
 around that.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.359
See what else they've got.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.229
Okay, communications are up.
 We should be able
 to talk to Destiny.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.531
Just hit that button.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.699
This one?
 Yeah.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.967
Colonel, this is Scott,
 do you read?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.739
Yeah, we read you.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.741
Yeah, we are in one
 of the archive rooms.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.375
There's a bunch of them,
 on several levels.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.545
Still no people?

06:17.578 --> 06:18.779
Not a soul.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.080
Well, we have power, though.

06:20.113 --> 06:25.052
The grid draws
from a combo of solar,
wind and geothermal energy.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.086
Is there anything
 worth salvaging?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.688
ELI: Tons!

06:27.721 --> 06:29.089
We found the Testament
 people were talking about,

06:29.122 --> 06:32.626
the entire Teneran repository,
 thousands of Kino recordings,

06:32.660 --> 06:34.428
historical documents,

06:34.462 --> 06:36.630
a detailed account
of when we first
got here from Destiny.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.732
None of which is any
 good to us right now.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.267
We've got a ship
 full of people.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.235
We need supplies
 for life support.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.773
There's also food storage.
 Canned goods,
 survival-type rations.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.309
Good, we'll use the shuttles
 to start ferrying
 supplies to Destiny.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.277
You should go down,
 check the place out.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.411
Okay.

06:51.445 --> 06:52.646
Keep me posted.
SCOTT: Yes, sir.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.652
Colonel! People are
 starting to pass out.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.053
Atmosphere's way too thin.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.288
We've got four addresses.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.223
YOUNG: Start dialing.
 Whoa, wait!

07:03.256 --> 07:05.092
What if they're
 worse than this place?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.494
We can't just
 walk through blind.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.828
We'll just send
 a Kino through first.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.497
What, there's more than one?

07:09.530 --> 07:11.064
Six, actually.
 I wasn't the only one

07:11.098 --> 07:12.566
who decided to
 sneak one through.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.701
YOUNG: Start dialing!

07:17.370 --> 07:18.839
Long way down, huh?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.574
Yeah, my ears
 popped on the way.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.676
I like the muzak, though.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.512
So this is
 the archive room?

07:24.545 --> 07:26.780
Yeah, the main one.
 Five others above us.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.249
Above that,
 living quarters,

07:29.282 --> 07:31.519
tech and other supplies,
 food storage.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.186
Scott and Greer
 are already up there
 scouting the place.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.755
Where you going?

07:34.788 --> 07:36.590
To join them.
 ELI: They don't
 need any help.

07:36.624 --> 07:37.390
Young's sending down...

07:40.360 --> 07:41.294
Yup.

07:43.831 --> 07:44.765
Colonel,
 this is Scott, come in.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.534
YOUNG: Go ahead.

07:46.567 --> 07:50.504
Yeah, this planet looks good.
 You can start
 sending people through.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.872
Copy that.

07:51.905 --> 07:54.474
Well, this is it,
 our new home,

07:56.744 --> 07:58.546
a planet known only to God.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.651
BRODY: Hell of a lot
 of data here.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.386
Yeah, it looks like
 they documented everything.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.622
"It is easier to
 know where you are going

08:08.656 --> 08:11.825
"when you know
 where you have been."
 Eli Wallace.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.734
You know,
 it's going to take years
 to get through all this.

08:20.768 --> 08:21.735
We'll bring it
 back to Destiny.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.236
Yeah.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.238
These drives are built
 right into the structure,

08:25.272 --> 08:27.240
so I don't think
 we're going to be able
 to physically move them.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.377
So we configure an uplink,
 stream the data.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.712
My thoughts exactly.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.551
Brody.
 Hmm.

08:38.885 --> 08:39.753
Brody!
 Hmm!

08:44.457 --> 08:45.458
Sorry.

08:46.426 --> 08:47.861
Is it okay if I do this?

08:47.895 --> 08:52.733
Uh... Maybe I should do it.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.835
You are the founding father
of the enemy nation,
after all.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.803
BRODY: Hmm.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.572
Futura.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.242
That's just stupid.

09:02.275 --> 09:02.876
Enough with the name.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.682
SCOTT: That's it.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.251
Some people brought through

09:11.284 --> 09:12.452
clothing items,
 hairpins, bandannas.
 We're going through it all.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.521
Not much.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.923
We just have to
 make do until Rush
 figures out where we are

09:15.956 --> 09:17.257
and brings Destiny back
 in range so we can dial.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.860
ELI: Seriously?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.762
WRAY: Adam, Destiny's gone.
 Destroyed.

09:21.795 --> 09:22.863
BRODY: We don't
 know that for certain.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.297
ELI: No, we don't,

09:24.331 --> 09:27.467
but we also don't
 know if this is
 present day, either.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.370
We were dialing inside a star.
 It could've hit a solar flare.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.739
For all we know,
 we could've gone
 back in time,

09:31.772 --> 09:34.474
or forward,
 days, months, years.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.711
The fact is,
 we're stuck here now
 for God knows how long,

09:37.745 --> 09:41.815
so we need to build shelter,
 we need to find food.
 Let's move.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.790
GREER: Rush, come
 check this out!

09:51.458 --> 09:54.461
2,000 years
on the other side
of the universe,

09:55.663 --> 09:58.298
and beef jerky survives.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.003
Hey, there you are!

10:03.036 --> 10:05.305
Eli and the others
 are working on a way

10:05.338 --> 10:07.675
to upload the archive
 back up to Destiny.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.811
If we try to go
 through it all down here,
 we'd never leave.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.014
What are you reading?

10:14.047 --> 10:16.850
There are thousands
 of books in here.

10:16.884 --> 10:20.353
A bunch of
 school textbooks, math,
 science, all written by Eli.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.756
The college dropout.

10:22.790 --> 10:23.857
Yeah.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.527
So you've been
 sitting down here
 reading textbooks?

10:27.560 --> 10:28.862
No, I found my diary.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.599
I know, weird.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.869
My first entry when
 we got to this planet,

10:35.903 --> 10:40.774
"The air is good.
 Plenty of trees, fresh water,
 a lot like Earth.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.376
"Two weeks have gone by,
 and we now have
 a name for our home.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.046
"Novus. It means new.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.716
"We're trying to settle in,
 get some decent
 shelters built.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.718
"I'm still not sleeping well.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.320
"Never thought I'd say this,

10:53.353 --> 10:54.722
"but I mis Destiny."

10:54.755 --> 10:58.058
BRODY: Look, I already
told you we can't
move there.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.627
Why not?
 It's not far. It's flat,
 wide open, plenty of room...

11:00.660 --> 11:03.663
Because it's a flood plain.
 First rain, and we're
 washed out.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.333
We've got good
 protection here, up slope,
 out of the wind.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.635
Plenty of trees to build
 proper shelter, homes...

11:08.668 --> 11:11.038
How? We have no tools.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.573
BRODY: One of
 the springs on the plain
 is seeping ferric hydroxide.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.575
Bog iron deposits.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.577
It should get us
jump-started on
basic tool-making,

11:17.610 --> 11:19.980
then we can really
 speed things up.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.015
I still think it's a good idea
 to look for a better...

11:22.049 --> 11:23.116
You know what,
 it was your good idea

11:23.150 --> 11:24.852
that got us
stuck on this planet
in the first place!

11:24.885 --> 11:27.054
What? You agreed with it...

11:27.087 --> 11:29.422
We are here because
 of your calculations!

11:29.456 --> 11:30.590
Both of you,
 stop this right now.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.926
We're not doing
 this again, all right?

11:32.960 --> 11:35.996
The decision is made.
We are staying here.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.597
Sir, we're going to
 have to build a fence.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.699
There's wildlife
 on this planet.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.001
We just saw
 some nasty-looking
 creatures on our scout.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.435
Great.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.871
SCOTT: I've got
 people out on patrol,

11:43.904 --> 11:45.372
but we're going
 to run out of ammo
 real quick.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.439
Yeah, hence the fence.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.607
YOUNG: Right.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.877
Sounds good.
 How about we do it. Let's go.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.350
It's amazing.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.421
We came here with
 hardly anything,
 and 2,000 years later...

12:01.454 --> 12:02.890
Our kids done good.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.327
Kind of want to
 read the rest of it.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.729
See who ended up with...

12:09.763 --> 12:10.898
(RUMBLING)

12:11.932 --> 12:12.900
Under the table!

12:30.851 --> 12:31.952
Uh, guys?

12:34.021 --> 12:36.523
You might want to get moving
 on that data transfer.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.830
You okay?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.397
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.933
Whoo. I hate earthquakes.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.035
Yeah? It's my
 first, actually.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.639
Greer, this is Scott,
 you okay up there?

12:52.672 --> 12:54.674
Yeah, everybody's all good.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.076
We're sending
 down additional teams
 to help with those supplies.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.777
We need to pick up the pace.

12:57.811 --> 12:58.711
Copy that.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.750
CHLOE: "Six weeks
 on the planet.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.586
"We've been doing okay,
 for the most part.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.021
"Until today."

13:08.055 --> 13:09.990
Garden?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.192
The fruit that
 Scott and Greer found?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.061
Planting some seeds,
 see what happens.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.397
T.J.!

13:23.536 --> 13:25.873
CHLOE: "Volker's condition
 is getting worse.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.541
T.J. doesn't know
 what's wrong with him.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.710
"She thinks maybe his
 kidneys are failing,

13:30.743 --> 13:33.881
"but without any
 medical equipment,
 she can't be sure.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.748
"And there's nothing
 she can do to help him."

13:43.891 --> 13:45.893
"Today we had
 our first funeral.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.930
"Dr. Dale Volker."

14:01.942 --> 14:04.744
Hey, Lieutenant
Scott just radioed.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.180
The shuttle's loaded

14:07.214 --> 14:08.081
and ready to take
 you back to Destiny
 to start the uplink.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.763
A small cut,
 but it may need
 a couple of stitches.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.900
I'm fine...
 You will be,
 once I patch you up.

14:30.070 --> 14:30.870
(GROANS)

14:33.640 --> 14:35.208
You're not
 getting enough rest.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.143
Nobody is.

14:37.911 --> 14:39.612
The others follow your lead.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.781
What is that?
 The stitches, what is it?

14:41.814 --> 14:45.285
Tendons from one
 of those animals
 Greer killed.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.787
The needle could use
 a little work, though.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.089
Best Brody could
 make on short notice.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.625
You okay?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.095
Yeah.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.129
With all this
 construction going on,

14:56.163 --> 14:57.797
people need to
 be more careful.

14:57.830 --> 14:59.499
Not overdo it,
 know when to rest.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.171
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.310
JOHANSEN: Okay, there you go.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.111
Take it easy and
 watch for infection.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.179
Got it.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.115
Son of a...

15:15.148 --> 15:18.551
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good...

15:18.585 --> 15:19.619
Hey, listen.

15:20.687 --> 15:21.854
Nobody blames you.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.692
It is what it is.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.528
We're here,

15:30.697 --> 15:33.866
and we have our
 whole lives ahead.
 Make the most of it.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.872
That easy, huh?
No.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.212
But beating
 yourself up every day
 just makes it worse.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.001
ELI: The stargate was
 destroyed in one
 of the eruptions,

16:08.035 --> 16:10.170
buried in lava decades ago.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.639
Most of the people left
the planet before then,

16:12.672 --> 16:18.211
but after they lost
 the gate, they needed to
 figure another way out.

16:18.245 --> 16:21.114
Both of the countries realized
 they stood a better
 chance of survival

16:21.148 --> 16:23.616
if they worked together,

16:23.650 --> 16:28.388
so they pooled their resources
 and they built ships.
 Huge, huge ships.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.390
Not capable of FTL,

16:30.423 --> 16:33.360
but big enough to evacuate
 the rest of the population.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.961
Where did they go?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.729
They went to one of
 the planets they had

16:36.763 --> 16:38.798
previously sent
 an expedition team to.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.301
10 days travel for
 us on Destiny in FTL,

16:41.334 --> 16:44.037
but it'll take them
a few hundred years
with their ships.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.206
Good to know they
got their act together.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.287
Hey, look,
 we never really talked.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.890
Don't worry about it.
I'm okay.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.863
See, this is always the time
 I do something to
 sabotage things.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.799
It's kind of
 a defense mechanism.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.402
Tough to explain.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.372
It's not tough at all.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.108
Everything you've
ever cared about
has been taken from you

17:22.142 --> 17:24.144
so you're trying to make sure
 it doesn't happen again.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.880
This is a huge
step for you, Matt.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.218
I'm proud of you.

17:31.251 --> 17:34.421
You should be
 proud of yourself.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.857
Well, still, I'll understand
 if you don't wanna come.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.160
Are you kidding?
First wedding on Novus?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.296
Camile's gonna
 make a pie, so...

17:45.332 --> 17:46.333
I wouldn't miss it.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.006
CHLOE: "Today was
 a good day on Novus.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.844
"The best day yet."

18:10.490 --> 18:12.859
So, everybody's hooking up.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.329
Matt and Chloe are married.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.366
Now rumor is Varro and James
 are getting together.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.802
Figures.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.872
T.J. just had her baby boy,
 named him Steven,
 after her father.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.777
Yeah. Everybody's
 getting together,

18:33.045 --> 18:34.214
except me

18:35.515 --> 18:38.185
and Brody.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.853
This is Eli. Is Volker
 back on the ship yet?

18:40.887 --> 18:42.422
Yeah, I'm here.
Are you ready?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.923
All set.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.057
We're starting
 the transfer now.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.363
PARK: Eli, look at this.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.999
The factory where
they built their
interstellar ships?

18:53.032 --> 18:55.168
According to this,
 there's one ship
 still in there.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.804
It was still
 under construction
 when they left the planet.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.038
How close to completion?

18:59.071 --> 19:00.273
Is it operational?

19:00.307 --> 19:01.841
I don't know.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.477
What?

19:04.511 --> 19:05.512
ELI: Let's see.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.282
Come on.
 I'm documenting
 your progress.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.050
You'll thank me for
 this later, I promise.

19:13.052 --> 19:13.853
Come on.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.457
And how far along are you?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.992
Six months.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.294
Matt's going crazy
 trying to build them

19:21.328 --> 19:23.330
a house before
 the baby arrives.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.565
I told him not
 to worry about it,
 but you know Matt.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.133
Sign he's going to
 make a great father.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.335
And you a great uncle.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.909
PARK: Oh, crap.

19:36.943 --> 19:39.312
I just accessed
 the geothermal
 monitoring data.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.480
It turns out
 their theory's right.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.882
A black hole has
 entered this system.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.552
The tidal forces are
 ripping this planet apart.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.220
Is that a fault line?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.255
Yeah! Running
 right under the city.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.089
Very active,
 and very shallow.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.425
The crust is
 increasingly thin,
 like shattering glass.

19:52.459 --> 19:55.328
Magma bubbling up everywhere.
 We can't stay here
 much longer.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.597
The database is immense.
 The transfer could take days.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.366
37 hours with my
compression algorithm.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.269
Well, let's hope
that's enough time.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.573
(SCREAMING)

20:06.606 --> 20:07.840
Good, good,
 you're doing good.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.409
Where's T.J.?

20:09.442 --> 20:10.743
Eli went to get her.
 Don't worry, don't worry.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.612
You're doing fine.
 I love you. Just don't
 forget to breathe...

20:12.645 --> 20:14.581
Shut up and leave me alone!

20:14.614 --> 20:16.849
Oh, thank God! Come on...

20:16.883 --> 20:18.385
Okay, just breathe.
 Yeah, yeah,

20:18.418 --> 20:19.252
I've been telling her
 to keep breathing...

20:19.286 --> 20:20.453
No, you!

20:20.487 --> 20:22.121
Okay.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.122
Wow, just on time.
 You're crowning.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.291
What can I do?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.859
You can get ready
 to cut the cord.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.229
Okay, Chloe,
 one last push. Ready?

20:32.465 --> 20:33.600
(SCREAMING)

20:34.901 --> 20:36.002
(SCREAMING)

20:36.503 --> 20:37.837
(SCREAMING)

20:38.405 --> 20:39.839
(SCREAMING)

20:44.243 --> 20:45.312
It's a boy.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.854
I can't believe it.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.857
I'm a daddy.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.860
You have any
 names picked out?

21:03.363 --> 21:04.364
Dale.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.505
Babies are being born.

21:12.539 --> 21:18.177
Chloe, Park, James.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.548
T.J. and Colonel Young
 already have two:
 a boy and a girl.

21:25.718 --> 21:30.323
It's good,
 you know, for the future
 of our settlement,

21:32.158 --> 21:34.026
but still, sometimes...

21:35.395 --> 21:37.063
It's a girl.
 Huh.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.666
Mom and baby are fine.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.402
(EXHALES)

21:44.404 --> 21:45.672
You okay?

21:46.706 --> 21:49.909
Yeah. Just, uh, tired.

21:52.044 --> 21:52.912
Yeah.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.317
(SCREAMING)

22:06.593 --> 22:08.495
Me and Corporal Barnes?

22:10.096 --> 22:11.698
Something worth pursuing?

22:32.284 --> 22:33.185
(RUMBLING)

22:42.395 --> 22:43.730
Rush?
 Yeah.

22:46.599 --> 22:49.301
How bad?
 SCOTT: Park says 6.2.
 Pretty strong.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.773
The fault line they discovered
 is getting wider.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.442
The city's
 crumbling into it.

22:55.475 --> 22:57.109
All right, well, be smart.

22:57.143 --> 22:59.011
Don't wait too long
 to get the hell out of there.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.448
We won't. We've got
a pretty good eye on it,

23:01.481 --> 23:04.083
and it looks like this bunker
 was built to withstand a lot.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.151
I think we're okay.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.558
CHLOE: And?

23:11.591 --> 23:12.592
And what?

23:13.460 --> 23:14.594
CHLOE: How was it?

23:14.627 --> 23:16.295
It was fine.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.665
We had a very
 pleasant dinner.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.470
Of all the dates I've
 had since we got here,

23:23.503 --> 23:26.005
she's easily the most
 compatible with me.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.475
So then what's the problem?

23:28.508 --> 23:29.776
I don't know.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.012
I mean,

23:34.781 --> 23:38.317
I've already
 found my soul mate.
 I don't need another.

23:40.520 --> 23:44.190
Steven, no, don't eat that!
Don't eat that...

23:45.458 --> 23:46.593
That was a close call.

23:46.626 --> 23:47.660
Yeah.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.029
CHLOE: You okay?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.700
Yeah.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.367
Yeah.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.143
SCOTT: Records say
 there's actually a ship
 still in the factory

24:04.176 --> 24:06.412
a few kilometers
 outside the city.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.748
Doesn't say if it's
 operational or not,
 but if it is,

24:08.781 --> 24:11.083
it'll be capable of holding
 the entire group
 of descendants.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.252
All right.
 Go ahead and check it out.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.487
How's the transfer coming?

24:14.521 --> 24:16.288
VOLKER: So far, so good.

24:16.322 --> 24:20.493
Just over 900 exabytes.
 Still a drop in the bucket,
 though.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.428
Perfect.
 I need you to take
 me back to Destiny.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.497
No, I'm flying them over
 to check out that
 ship-building factory.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.332
Yeah, fine, then you can
 take me back to the Destiny.

24:43.750 --> 24:47.687
My symptoms are getting worse.
 It's affecting my legs.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.591
I'm losing my balance,
 stumbling.

24:52.592 --> 24:55.227
My speech is also...

24:55.261 --> 24:58.264
I'm slurring
 words here and there.
 I have trouble eating.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.403
I wish I could do a more
 accurate diagnosis, but...

25:08.207 --> 25:11.844
It sounds like ALS,
 Lou Gehrig's Disease.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.689
Tamara, I just heard.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.927
This disease,

25:27.960 --> 25:31.263
just because
 the other you got it
 when you came to this planet,

25:31.297 --> 25:32.699
it doesn't mean
 you'll get it.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.767
Yeah, it does.

25:34.801 --> 25:39.205
It's not something
 that you contract.
 I'm carrying it right now.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.741
Is there anything you can do?
 Any medicines?

25:42.642 --> 25:44.276
There's no cure.

25:54.253 --> 25:55.287
Coming up on the factory.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.244
T.J.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.311
Colonel, you didn't have
 to come down here.

26:23.349 --> 26:26.919
Volker's checking
 Destiny's medical
database to see...

26:26.953 --> 26:28.621
To see if there's anything,

26:28.655 --> 26:30.957
anything in there at all
 on this disease, okay?

26:32.424 --> 26:34.894
The first symptoms
 presented

26:34.927 --> 26:36.696
five years after we
 arrived on the planet.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.800
I died a few years
 after that.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.705
This is Scott.
 Has Colonel Young
 arrived there yet?

26:51.510 --> 26:54.681
Yeah, Scott,
 I'm here.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.784
Yeah, we just did
 a pass over the site
 where the factory used to be.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.920
It's gone.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.923
The fault line cut
 right through it.
 It's a river of lava now.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.258
We need to leave
 this planet immediately.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.360
Agreed. Scott,
 get everyone back to Destiny,

27:08.394 --> 27:11.363
then get back down here.
 We'll start clearing out.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.365
Yeah, but, sir, what about
 all those people
 back on Destiny?

27:13.399 --> 27:14.834
Nearest planet
 is 10 days away...

27:14.867 --> 27:16.035
No, don't worry about it,
 they'll be fine.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.370
Yeah, we don't have a choice.
 We have to...

27:18.404 --> 27:20.506
We have to get
 everyone back on board.

27:20.539 --> 27:21.808
Copy.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.459
About a third of the database
 has been transferred.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.795
Still a long way to go.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.930
We're cutting it short.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.632
I want everyone
 back to the surface
 as soon as possible for evac.

28:53.665 --> 28:54.901
But, Colonel,
 there's still so much
 that we can...

28:54.934 --> 28:55.968
(RUMBLING)

28:56.002 --> 28:56.903
Get down. Get down.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.048
You all right?
 ELI: Yeah.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.817
All right,
 get back to the surface.
 Wait for Scott's shuttle.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.391
You all right?

29:19.425 --> 29:21.493
I heard the others
 talking about you.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.996
The disease you carry,
 we have a cure.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.398
You do?

29:26.432 --> 29:29.735
Our scientists discovered it
 over 200 years ago.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.604
Cures for other
 diseases, as well.
 All of them in the archive.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.782
VOLKER: Rush,
 are you back on Destiny?

29:45.484 --> 29:46.785
Yes, I'm here.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.654
Then why didn't you tell me?

29:48.687 --> 29:50.857
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware
I had to check in with you.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.058
You heard about T.J.?

29:54.493 --> 29:55.962
Yeah.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.596
I'm searching
 the Ancient medical database

29:57.629 --> 30:01.167
for anything on ALS,
 and I could really
 use some help.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.202
I'm sorry, I'm a bit
 busy at the moment.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.536
Doing what?

30:04.570 --> 30:05.604
Something more pressing.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.040
I'll be with you
 when I'm finished.

30:08.074 --> 30:14.180
Our son, Alan,
 just broke the news.
 His wife, Claire, is pregnant.

30:14.213 --> 30:17.749
Grandparents.
 We're going to
 be grandparents.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.988
Well, it's that time again.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.822
The yearly family reunion.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.894
Three kids and five grandkids.

30:27.927 --> 30:31.163
Just drafted a rough outline
 of a constitution.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.598
People are
 responding well to it,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.067
for the most part.

30:35.101 --> 30:38.971
Oh, and we're converting
 one of the storage houses

30:39.005 --> 30:41.740
into a schoolroom.

30:41.773 --> 30:45.878
Eli's teaching the kids.
 He's actually
 quite good at it.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.581
A wonderful teacher.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.084
ELI: Hmm. Thanks.

30:52.118 --> 30:57.123
Four sons, three daughters,
 15 grandchildren.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.793
I'm tired.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.867
All these kids,
 laughing and dancing.
 Everybody dancing.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.106
Tearing up my lawn.
 When I was a kid,

31:14.140 --> 31:16.542
we had more
 respect for people's...

31:16.575 --> 31:18.044
Touched down, sir.
 Greer and his team

31:18.077 --> 31:20.512
are bringing up
the next batch of supplies.

31:20.546 --> 31:24.183
Copy that. Chloe and Wray
 are also headed up with Yaozu.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.953
Take Brody and Park with you.
 I'll take everyone
 else on the other shuttle.

31:26.986 --> 31:28.220
Copy that.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.122
Eli, anything?

31:30.156 --> 31:32.291
We had to compress the data
to speed up the transfer.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.893
One huge file.
 Which means I can't
 do a specific search

31:34.927 --> 31:37.129
for ALS until we uncompress
 what we've already uploaded,

31:37.163 --> 31:40.632
and I can't do that
until we stop the transfer.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.269
About a third of the database
 has already gone through,

31:43.302 --> 31:45.037
so there's
 a one-in-three chance
 it's in there.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.305
The longer we wait,
 the better the chances.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.706
I say it's worth
 it to stay and...

31:47.739 --> 31:48.840
(RUMBLING)

32:02.955 --> 32:04.656
CHLOE: "Colonel
 Young won re-election.

32:04.690 --> 32:08.027
"Most of us are happy,
 but some still want to
 do things differently.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.965
"Today a group
 of them announced
 they're leaving.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.666
"Whether they
 stay here on Novus

32:14.700 --> 32:16.202
"or gate to another planet,
 they didn't say."

32:18.704 --> 32:23.809
ELI: Power's cut off.
 Data transfer's
 shut down and communications.

32:23.842 --> 32:26.645
VARRO: A big
 section of stairs are out
 about six levels up.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.747
Scott, this is Young,
 can you read?

32:28.780 --> 32:29.948
Yeah, Colonel.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.184
Everyone make it out?

32:32.218 --> 32:35.021
Yeah, everyone's okay.
They're all aboard.
You all right?

32:35.054 --> 32:37.123
Yeah, we're fine,
 but we're cut off.

32:37.156 --> 32:40.292
No power to the elevators,
 and the stairs are out.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.228
We're gonna have to
 climb up the ladder.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.066
Eli...

32:52.738 --> 32:53.905
Great.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.852
(RUMBLING)

33:18.064 --> 33:20.366
Colonel, this is Scott,
 we made it down to Level 14.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.901
Stairs are out below.
We got rope if you need it.

33:22.934 --> 33:25.204
YOUNG: You should be
 on your way back t Destiny.

33:25.237 --> 33:26.772
SCOTT: We'll leave
 when you leave, sir.

33:27.773 --> 33:28.874
There's Eli.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.101
(JOHANSEN SCREAMS)

34:00.906 --> 34:01.873
Platform!

34:04.943 --> 34:06.212
(VARRO GROANS)

34:07.413 --> 34:08.980
(VARRO GRUNTING)

34:12.150 --> 34:13.119
(THUDDING)

34:24.730 --> 34:26.398
YOUNG: Throw down the rope!
 We just lost Varro!

34:39.145 --> 34:40.679
You all right?
 Yeah.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.085
YOUNG: Okay, pull her up.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.960
SCOTT: We got her!
 Sending the rope back down.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.214
YOUNG: Okay, pull!

35:38.537 --> 35:39.838
He's alive.

35:51.082 --> 35:51.883
(RUMBLING)

35:53.519 --> 35:55.754
Pull! Now!

36:01.827 --> 36:03.329
Where are the rest?

36:03.362 --> 36:04.496
We put them on
the other shuttle.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.931
Everyone hang on!

36:41.633 --> 36:43.569
I'm sorry, Chloe.

36:45.571 --> 36:46.972
Sorry for what?

36:48.540 --> 36:50.108
I never got us home.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.247
SCOTT: Got here as
 quick as we could.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.385
YOUNG: Sara...

37:00.419 --> 37:02.220
I'm here, Dad.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.155
Colonel,

37:09.561 --> 37:10.962
we are home.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.493
PARK: For CO2 scrubbing.

37:41.527 --> 37:43.662
A highly advanced substance.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.465
Much more effective than lime.
 This one canister alone
 will last for years.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.300
And you brought
back cases of it?

37:48.334 --> 37:50.636
We'll certainly need it
with all these
extra people on board.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.104
Well, it's just 10 days
 till we drop them off

37:53.138 --> 37:55.173
with the people
 on the expedition planet.

37:55.206 --> 37:56.141
Yeah.

38:03.214 --> 38:04.383
It burns you up, doesn't it?

38:05.283 --> 38:06.518
What?

38:06.552 --> 38:08.354
We did all right
after leaving Destiny.

38:09.521 --> 38:10.622
We got along just fine

38:12.190 --> 38:13.124
without you.

38:19.565 --> 38:22.334
Broken ribs.
 Lacerations, bruises.

38:22.368 --> 38:26.672
He's stable for now,
 but all we can do
 is wait and watch.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.443
We've been
 searching what we were

38:31.477 --> 38:33.244
able to transfer
 from the archive.

38:35.080 --> 38:35.681
The ALS cure
 wasn't in there.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.452
Well, what about
 Destiny Ancient database?

38:40.486 --> 38:44.222
Nothing in there yet, either.
 It's difficult.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.958
Different names for
 diseases, procedures.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.494
It's hard to do
 a quick search.

38:51.262 --> 38:55.133
What about the ships
 that they used
 to evacuate Novus?

38:55.166 --> 38:57.068
They probably took a copy
 of the archive with them,

38:57.102 --> 38:58.570
so when we drop
 people off on the planet...

38:58.604 --> 38:59.671
They won't be there yet.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.743
The ships don't have FTL.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.746
They won't arrive
 for 200 years,

39:07.779 --> 39:09.415
and finding them
 in the middle
 of empty space...

39:09.448 --> 39:10.582
Yeah.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.321
But, T.J.,
 there's so much else

39:16.354 --> 39:17.989
that did make it
 in the transfer.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.727
A ton of other
 medical stuff.

39:21.760 --> 39:24.630
We can learn from it,
 from our descendants.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.633
We will figure out a cure.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.439
I know it.

39:44.315 --> 39:45.250
MATTHEW: I'd like
 to thank you all

39:45.283 --> 39:48.454
for coming to this
 very special occasion,

39:48.487 --> 39:51.757
the dedication of our
 beautiful new school.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.292
My grandfather spent
 his life laying down

39:54.325 --> 39:57.228
the foundation for
 our education system.

39:57.262 --> 40:00.031
It's why this new
 school bears his name.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.534
As principal,
 I'll do my best to uphold

40:02.568 --> 40:06.304
his legacy of
 inquiry and discovery

40:06.337 --> 40:10.141
and to carry it forward
 to future generations.

40:10.175 --> 40:13.144
Now, please help me welcome
 our guest of honor,

40:13.178 --> 40:18.149
two-term mayor,
 the author of
 our constitution,

40:18.183 --> 40:21.653
and the last surviving member
 of the settlers from Destiny,

40:22.688 --> 40:24.122
Camile Wray.

40:42.107 --> 40:45.276
I want to begin with
 a few words of greeting.

40:46.812 --> 40:50.616
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

40:50.649 --> 40:54.786
May all things go
 according to the wishes
 of those that hear it.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.723
When we first arrived here,

40:58.890 --> 41:02.327
we thought we had failed.

41:02.360 --> 41:05.063
We didn't achieve
 the mission on Destiny,

41:07.499 --> 41:11.670
but now, looking at
all your smiling faces,

41:11.703 --> 41:13.739
at this beautiful new school,

41:15.741 --> 41:19.578
I can't help but feel
 a great sense of pride

41:21.346 --> 41:22.514
and success.

41:25.751 --> 41:28.086
Because, as we discovered,

41:30.421 --> 41:33.759
our mission is,
 and always will be,

41:34.660 --> 41:36.494
the journey itself.
