WEBVTT

00:04.502 --> 00:06.571
Pack to you some of
the last night lasagna.

00:06.596 --> 00:08.051
Mmh. Thank you babe.

00:08.313 --> 00:09.666
- Okay.
- All right.

00:09.691 --> 00:10.691
Yes.

00:10.716 --> 00:11.716
Bye.

00:13.002 --> 00:14.407
Wait. Almost forgot.

00:14.432 --> 00:16.877
I bought you these.

00:16.902 --> 00:19.104
Memory foam, on your feet all day.

00:19.129 --> 00:21.159
I don't know what I'd do without you.

00:21.184 --> 00:22.892
Yeah.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:32.402 --> 00:33.955
Yes.

00:35.766 --> 00:37.066
Yes...

00:37.100 --> 00:38.594
what?

00:39.102 --> 00:42.239
I'm sorry that it took so long,

00:42.405 --> 00:45.471
but I do want to marry you.

00:46.611 --> 00:50.170
I mean, if the offer still stands.

00:54.930 --> 00:58.093
I've been sitting on this for months.

00:58.453 --> 01:00.417
Just waiting.

01:06.453 --> 01:09.475
- What?
- Yeah.

01:10.421 --> 01:14.455
My God. It's beautiful.

01:15.189 --> 01:16.871
Tate, yes!

01:26.069 --> 01:27.669
Hey.

01:27.694 --> 01:29.622
I thought you were
picking up an extra shift.

01:29.648 --> 01:31.317
Yeah, I was hoping to, but Goodwin

01:31.342 --> 01:33.409
put a moratorium on overtime.

01:33.575 --> 01:35.972
I do not wanna go home right now

01:35.997 --> 01:38.965
- and face Mandelbrot.
- What? Is your new roomie

01:38.990 --> 01:40.582
still leaving toe nail
clippings on the couch?

01:40.607 --> 01:43.503
Worse. Now he's doing
jumping jacks in the nude.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.917
Okay, you really need a new roommate.

01:45.942 --> 01:47.642
I can't make rent without him.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.809
Well, hey, if worst comes to worst,

01:49.834 --> 01:51.797
got plenty of beds down in the morgue.

01:51.822 --> 01:53.456
Yeah.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.681
Yeah, I bet you do.
I might take you up on that.

01:55.706 --> 01:58.251
Have a good day.

01:58.684 --> 02:00.572
Um, Dr. Halstead?

02:00.597 --> 02:01.764
Yeah?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.735
I, I don't mean to pry,

02:04.760 --> 02:07.929
but it sounds to me like
you may be in need of

02:07.954 --> 02:09.989
a little extra cash flow.

02:10.231 --> 02:13.607
Now just hear me out for one sec.

02:15.067 --> 02:18.343
I think I can help.

02:19.071 --> 02:21.546
Dr. Manning, incoming, Trauma 3.

02:23.222 --> 02:27.225
61 year-old male, BP 140/90, fever 101.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.559
Called it in himself

02:28.584 --> 02:30.053
but could hardly breathe
by the time we got there.

02:30.078 --> 02:32.058
- Please...
- Sir, I need you to relax.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.461
- Listen to me.
- Just try to relax, okay?

02:33.486 --> 02:35.387
Listen to me!

02:35.412 --> 02:36.618
All right, let's start a Neb treatment

02:36.643 --> 02:38.854
and get 125 milligrams solumedrol IV.

02:38.879 --> 02:40.079
Okay, got it.

02:40.104 --> 02:42.348
And an ABG kit...

02:42.373 --> 02:43.744
All right, let's transfer him.

02:43.769 --> 02:46.841
On my count. Ready? One, two, three.

02:47.181 --> 02:49.102
- Let's get it out.
- Let's get that Neb treatment.

02:49.127 --> 02:51.300
Coming up.

02:51.325 --> 02:53.297
Just try to relax, sir.

02:53.321 --> 02:55.590
All right, I need you to take
a deep breath for me, okay?

02:55.615 --> 02:57.017
There you go.

02:57.043 --> 02:59.030
Do you have any family we should notify?

02:59.055 --> 03:03.117
No... I need... I need
to speak to Sharon.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.540
Deep breaths.

03:04.565 --> 03:06.955
I need to speak to Sharon.

03:06.981 --> 03:09.259
- Relax, relax.
- Sharon... Sharon...

03:09.284 --> 03:11.341
- Take this in.
- McGee.

03:11.365 --> 03:12.596
What did he say?

03:12.621 --> 03:15.344
- Something about a Sharon.
- McGee. He said McGee.

03:16.937 --> 03:18.641
That's Goodwin's maiden name.

03:20.349 --> 03:22.432
Keep taking deep breaths, sir.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.956
I had a fever and a
headache for the past week,

03:35.981 --> 03:37.332
figured I had the flu.

03:37.357 --> 03:39.232
Next thing I know, I
can't catch my breath.

03:39.257 --> 03:42.590
- Any history of illness?
- Had a flare-up of colitis

03:42.615 --> 03:43.635
a few months back.

03:43.660 --> 03:46.147
Doctor put me on a course of steroids.

03:46.417 --> 03:48.300
Reggie Dixon.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.416
There she is.

03:50.441 --> 03:52.020
Just like I remember.

03:52.045 --> 03:54.899
It has been way too long.

03:54.924 --> 03:57.064
It sure has.

03:57.246 --> 03:59.934
Reggie and I grew up in
the same neighborhood.

04:00.116 --> 04:03.752
Haven't seen each other since when?

04:04.072 --> 04:07.147
The summer after my senior year

04:07.172 --> 04:08.766
- in High School.
- That's right.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.797
That's right. I'd just gotten back

04:10.822 --> 04:12.369
- from Vietnam.
- That's right.

04:12.394 --> 04:15.170
- You served?
- Sort of.

04:15.195 --> 04:18.654
I... only thing I ever
shot was my Pentax 1000.

04:18.678 --> 04:22.132
Aw. Reggie was a photographer with
"Stars and Stripes."

04:22.263 --> 04:24.451
Now they said that you're having trouble

04:24.476 --> 04:25.530
catching your breath?

04:25.555 --> 04:27.259
Well, I can't say

04:27.284 --> 04:28.820
you're making it any easier.

04:29.233 --> 04:30.603
Stop it.

04:30.628 --> 04:34.460
Mr. Dixon, um,
the doctor that put you on steroids...

04:34.485 --> 04:35.752
Can you get us his information?

04:35.777 --> 04:37.878
I can, but, he's in Paris.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.548
- In Paris.
- Yeah, Reuters had me

04:40.572 --> 04:43.347
stationed there,
and I transferred back here.

04:43.687 --> 04:45.788
Time to start the next chapter.

04:45.959 --> 04:49.194
And is there anyone we could call?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.587
Are your folks still living?

04:52.452 --> 04:54.049
How about a wife?

04:54.074 --> 04:57.447
Never married. Never put down any roots.

04:57.473 --> 04:59.444
Heard you were running
the show at this place,

04:59.469 --> 05:01.717
so I told the dispatcher
to route me here.

05:01.742 --> 05:03.163
Knew you'd have my back.

05:03.187 --> 05:05.085
Yeah. You know that's right.

05:05.116 --> 05:06.817
I'm glad you did.

05:07.093 --> 05:09.487
Nurse Doris here's
gonna draw some blood

05:09.512 --> 05:10.845
so we can order a few tests.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.170
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

05:12.195 --> 05:13.862
Thank you.

05:17.555 --> 05:20.227
So what are we looking at here?

05:20.251 --> 05:22.164
Well, he was on a course of steroids,

05:22.189 --> 05:24.582
which could have weakened
his immune system.

05:24.607 --> 05:25.995
We could be looking at
a respiratory infection.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.653
We'll get a chest X-ray and start him on

05:27.678 --> 05:30.425
broad spectrum antibiotics and
see what the labs say, Maggie.

05:30.450 --> 05:31.585
Copy.

05:31.610 --> 05:33.845
If you suspect anything,

05:33.872 --> 05:37.665
run it down, and you let me
know the second you get results.

05:37.690 --> 05:39.326
- Of course.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:39.351 --> 05:41.269
Okay.

05:41.690 --> 05:43.604
- Was it just me, or...
- No, she was

05:43.629 --> 05:44.933
- definitely flirting.
- Yeah.

05:45.832 --> 05:48.167
Please help.

05:48.192 --> 05:49.613
April, what is wrong?

05:49.638 --> 05:51.391
Please, my arm. It's killing me...

05:51.421 --> 05:52.851
- What?
- From the weight of this.

05:54.236 --> 05:55.562
What?

05:55.588 --> 05:57.636
Look at the sparkle on that thing.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.691
You are gonna need some sunglasses.

05:59.716 --> 06:01.556
Congratulations, April.

06:01.581 --> 06:03.389
- Congratulations.
- That is so pretty.

06:03.414 --> 06:04.281
Thank you.

06:04.306 --> 06:05.565
Hey, Mags, you see this thing?

06:05.590 --> 06:06.984
It's hard to miss.

06:07.009 --> 06:09.871
- Reese.
- So beautiful.

06:09.896 --> 06:12.158
Treatment 2. Tried to assign him

06:12.183 --> 06:15.236
to someone else,
but he said he would only talk to you.

06:15.262 --> 06:16.600
Okay.

06:17.815 --> 06:20.716
This is big.

06:20.888 --> 06:23.305
Danny, what's wrong?

06:23.846 --> 06:26.460
My stomach, it's tied up in knots.

06:27.108 --> 06:28.974
Well, let's take a look.

06:29.368 --> 06:31.314
Don't they have a clinic at the shelter?

06:31.339 --> 06:32.877
I'm not at the shelter anymore.

06:32.902 --> 06:34.074
What?

06:34.099 --> 06:35.830
A woman came in with her newborn.

06:35.855 --> 06:37.312
They said they needed the bed.

06:37.337 --> 06:38.604
Told me I had to leave.

06:38.629 --> 06:40.104
They kicked you out?

06:40.129 --> 06:41.602
I spend the night on the street.

06:41.627 --> 06:42.738
I barely slept.

06:42.764 --> 06:45.458
Hey, can you close the curtain?

06:47.518 --> 06:49.007
What's going on?

06:49.039 --> 06:51.167
I don't want them to find me, I...

06:51.265 --> 06:53.379
We took your tracking chip out.

06:53.404 --> 06:55.044
They know that I was here.

06:55.069 --> 06:57.249
Don't worry.

06:57.579 --> 07:00.023
I'm gonna keep you safe.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.847
Double iced latte with one
pump of sugar free vanilla.

07:06.023 --> 07:07.657
For Robin.

07:07.763 --> 07:09.461
Excuse me.

07:10.584 --> 07:13.817
I'm sorry, you just ordered
the exact same drink as me.

07:13.842 --> 07:14.909
Vanilla?

07:14.934 --> 07:16.965
A little dainty for a surgeon.

07:16.989 --> 07:18.381
What are the odds?

07:18.407 --> 07:21.641
Well, if you limit the
data set to just lattes,

07:21.666 --> 07:24.864
you've got iced or no
iced, caff or decaf...

07:24.890 --> 07:26.503
Don't forget the vanilla.

07:26.953 --> 07:29.748
I'd say the odds of any
two random people ordering

07:29.773 --> 07:33.346
the same thing are about 1 in 36.

07:33.371 --> 07:34.987
Good with numbers.

07:35.727 --> 07:39.048
Of course. Epidemiology.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.354
<i>Wait are you... Are you that Charles?</i>

07:43.379 --> 07:45.117
I'll see you later.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.867
Okay, designed it
myself. With one swipe,

07:48.892 --> 07:51.569
you get a board-certified
physician on your doorstep

07:51.594 --> 07:52.903
within the hour.

07:52.942 --> 07:56.802
- A house call app?
- I prefer medicinal concierge.

07:56.827 --> 07:58.957
Look, I just launched the
beta and I already got

07:58.982 --> 08:00.078
a write-up in TechCrunch.

08:00.104 --> 08:02.670
Subscriber base is set to
explode within the next quarter.

08:02.694 --> 08:04.736
And I've got a few residents on board,

08:04.762 --> 08:07.263
but with an attending,
we can make a killing.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.067
A killing making house calls.

08:09.202 --> 08:12.374
How does $200 a call sound?

08:12.671 --> 08:14.838
This is the future of
medicine. All right?

08:14.863 --> 08:17.790
And you have the option to
get in on the ground floor,

08:17.815 --> 08:19.957
without that annoying roommate.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.641
Here's one right now.

08:24.666 --> 08:28.536
A 23-year-old male with
a persistent nosebleed.

08:30.273 --> 08:33.639
So what do you say?

08:35.662 --> 08:37.852
Chicago P.D. dropped
her off this morning.

08:37.876 --> 08:40.114
They found her loitering
outside of a convenience store,

08:40.138 --> 08:42.058
jabbering to herself, disoriented,

08:42.083 --> 08:44.063
no idea where she'd come
from or how she got there.

08:44.096 --> 08:45.496
Pamela?

08:45.521 --> 08:47.167
I'm Dr. Charles.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.286
- You're not Bob.
- No.

08:50.427 --> 08:52.528
But you can call me Daniel.

08:52.603 --> 08:55.605
Um, do you mind if we ask
you a couple of questions?

08:58.572 --> 09:02.613
Dr. Wheeler was thinking
that maybe you're feeling

09:02.639 --> 09:03.820
a bit out of sorts.

09:03.845 --> 09:05.746
Do you know why you're here?

09:07.794 --> 09:12.030
I just wanted some ice cream, and...

09:13.052 --> 09:15.900
You know what? I think I might be able

09:15.925 --> 09:17.222
to help you out with that.

09:17.247 --> 09:19.108
What flavor were you thinking?

09:19.548 --> 09:21.710
- Cookie dough.
- Dang.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.786
That's my favorite. Um...

09:25.694 --> 09:28.630
You mind if I... If I look at your hand?

09:30.140 --> 09:31.895
Boy.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.283
You have really beautiful nails.

09:34.504 --> 09:36.405
You know what, Pamela?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.642
I'm gonna see what I can do
about that cookie dough, okay?

09:39.667 --> 09:40.748
Okay.

09:40.774 --> 09:42.775
Thanks.

09:44.246 --> 09:47.621
I need a CBC,
CMP and you better page cardiology.

09:47.647 --> 09:49.779
Why? I called you in
for a psych consult.

09:49.804 --> 09:51.772
She's not psychotic,
she has endocarditis.

09:51.797 --> 09:53.603
You didn't notice the fever?

09:53.628 --> 09:55.747
The splinter hemorrhages
under her nails?

09:55.772 --> 09:57.647
The cops said that she was
having a psychotic episode,

09:57.672 --> 09:59.802
- so I just assumed that...
- An infection is attacking

09:59.827 --> 10:02.032
her heart and sending
micro-strokes to her brain.

10:02.056 --> 10:03.990
Okay, so we should
page cardiology, right?

10:04.015 --> 10:05.331
You know what, Jason? I think I'm gonna

10:05.356 --> 10:07.257
take this myself, but good work, really.

10:07.282 --> 10:08.307
I mean it.

10:08.332 --> 10:10.022
- Maggie?
- Already on it.

10:10.047 --> 10:12.381
You know,
I was thinking it might be a good idea

10:12.406 --> 10:14.786
to loop in epidemiology, you know?

10:14.931 --> 10:16.625
Maybe Dr. Robin Charles?

10:16.650 --> 10:18.682
Just to be safe.

10:19.356 --> 10:22.807
Help, help, my bel... my belly!

10:22.832 --> 10:25.658
My belly is on fire! It's on fire!

10:25.682 --> 10:28.340
- Okay, okay.
- Help!

10:28.365 --> 10:29.959
- God...
- He's got a rash.

10:29.985 --> 10:32.603
It feels... It
feels like something's

10:32.627 --> 10:34.589
alive in there.

10:38.006 --> 10:40.412
It's not a rash.

10:40.653 --> 10:42.239
Those are worms.

10:49.419 --> 10:51.362
How the hell did I get worms?

10:51.387 --> 10:54.664
Have you traveled recently to
any underdeveloped countries?

10:54.689 --> 10:56.309
Anywhere tropical?

10:56.752 --> 10:58.568
The south of France is as tropical

10:58.593 --> 11:00.757
as I've gotten in the past 20 years.

11:00.782 --> 11:02.402
What about before that?

11:02.427 --> 11:04.204
You said you served with
"Stars and Stripes."

11:04.229 --> 11:05.963
Did you do any time in country?

11:05.997 --> 11:07.376
I was with the 7th Cav

11:07.401 --> 11:09.018
when they took Quang Tri.

11:10.013 --> 11:13.283
What, does that have
something to do with this?

11:15.903 --> 11:17.504
What aren't they telling me?

11:17.579 --> 11:19.547
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

11:19.572 --> 11:21.058
I wanna get a stool sample.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.884
- See what the labs say.
- Yeah.

11:22.909 --> 11:24.543
Just try to rest, Mr. Dixon.

11:24.568 --> 11:26.736
We'll be back soon.

11:30.998 --> 11:34.968
So what were you driving at in there?

11:34.993 --> 11:36.927
I think we're looking
at a parasitic roundworm

11:36.962 --> 11:38.262
called strongyloides.

11:38.296 --> 11:40.131
Seen a bunch of cases at the VA.

11:40.165 --> 11:41.866
I'm guessing he picked it up in Vietnam.

11:41.891 --> 11:44.531
But that was over 40 years ago.

11:44.556 --> 11:47.175
The worms embed themselves
in the intestinal wall

11:47.200 --> 11:48.734
and can remain dormant for decades.

11:48.759 --> 11:50.899
The steroids he was on
to treat his colitis

11:50.924 --> 11:52.408
must have suppressed his immune system,

11:52.433 --> 11:54.236
allowing the larvae to proliferate.

11:54.261 --> 11:56.659
So we put him on an anti-parasitic.

11:56.852 --> 11:58.653
That should clear him up, right?

11:58.678 --> 12:01.243
The worms have reached
the surface of his skin.

12:01.268 --> 12:03.977
I'd say he's in a hyperinfective state.

12:04.002 --> 12:05.648
Ms. Goodwin,

12:05.673 --> 12:09.660
I'm sorry,
but most patients don't survive this.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.566
I don't want you two
throwing in the towel

12:13.591 --> 12:15.263
before we've even started.

12:15.289 --> 12:17.867
Ms. Goodwin, we're just
presenting our medical opinion.

12:17.892 --> 12:21.895
I don't want your opinion.
I want you to keep him alive.

12:28.119 --> 12:30.120
So, what'd you find?

12:30.145 --> 12:32.074
MRSA's definitely a possibility.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.153
But it's hard to confirm
without a detailed history.

12:34.178 --> 12:35.779
Is there any family we can talk to?

12:35.804 --> 12:37.546
You know, so far, nobody that seems

12:37.571 --> 12:39.423
to be in the picture,
but we're still trying.

12:39.448 --> 12:41.550
Then I'll grow some cultures
and fill in the rest

12:41.575 --> 12:42.967
of the puzzle myself.

12:42.992 --> 12:45.067
Look, before you go, um,

12:45.653 --> 12:48.032
your mom told me you just
broke up with your boyfriend.

12:48.057 --> 12:49.092
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

12:49.117 --> 12:51.516
You keep canceling
coffee. We'll get to it.

12:51.541 --> 12:52.905
- We'll get to it.
- Okay.

12:52.930 --> 12:55.671
Look, it's so not a big deal,

12:55.696 --> 12:56.942
but I got this thing in my office,

12:56.967 --> 12:58.734
it's a pashmina scarf, you know?

12:58.759 --> 13:00.964
It's been up there for a while.
We could go up and get it.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.439
Thank you, Dad. But I really...

13:02.464 --> 13:04.107
- I gotta get cracking on this.
- Of course you do.

13:04.132 --> 13:06.152
Maybe later.

13:08.176 --> 13:09.886
Kids.

13:10.442 --> 13:12.366
People say the hardest
part is when they decide

13:12.391 --> 13:13.873
they don't need you anymore.

13:14.199 --> 13:16.856
- Yeah.
- Daniel? Daniel, Daniel.

13:16.881 --> 13:18.646
Where... where are they taking me?

13:19.327 --> 13:21.354
My friend, Dr. Berger... Alvin...

13:21.379 --> 13:23.380
Is taking you upstairs for a quick test.

13:23.405 --> 13:24.872
- Gonna take about five minutes.
- No, please,

13:24.897 --> 13:26.031
please don't leave me, Daniel.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.183
Please don't leave me.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.676
Okay. All right.

13:29.701 --> 13:33.969
Listen, Pamela, Dr. Berger... Alvin...

13:33.994 --> 13:35.470
Really knows what he's doing.

13:35.495 --> 13:39.331
And this is gonna literally
take about five minutes, okay?

13:40.864 --> 13:44.331
Why don't I take you upstairs
and get you settled, okay?

13:45.054 --> 13:49.012
- Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.293
So when did the bleeding start?

13:58.318 --> 13:59.200
This morning.

13:59.225 --> 14:00.505
Couldn't have come at a worse time.

14:00.530 --> 14:02.010
I don't get 10,000 lines of code

14:02.035 --> 14:03.368
written by the end of the week,

14:03.393 --> 14:05.895
my VC's gonna pull our series B round.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.420
Series B?

14:07.445 --> 14:09.111
That's pre-IPO.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.848
Besides the bleed,
anything else bothering you?

14:11.873 --> 14:14.141
I've got this headache,

14:14.256 --> 14:16.864
but that's probably
from staring at a screen

14:16.889 --> 14:18.181
for the last 48 hours.

14:18.206 --> 14:19.982
Any history of autoimmune disorders

14:20.007 --> 14:21.839
- or cancer in the family?
- Nada.

14:21.864 --> 14:23.307
Any past addiction, drug use?

14:23.332 --> 14:25.433
Only thing I'm addicted to is my work.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.250
Seen hundreds of bleeds in my day,

14:27.275 --> 14:29.959
most of them from far
worse places than a nose.

14:30.155 --> 14:31.922
Just try to relax, Eliot.

14:31.947 --> 14:34.014
We're gonna get you all fixed up.

14:36.532 --> 14:38.646
Protective custody?

14:38.671 --> 14:42.480
We don't have a suspect,
much less an open investigation.

14:42.962 --> 14:46.611
We legally can't protect
Danny unless he gives us

14:46.636 --> 14:48.919
information about the
people who held him captive.

14:48.944 --> 14:51.246
- So talk to him.
- I did. I tried.

14:51.271 --> 14:53.239
I went to the shelter and
he wouldn't talk to me.

14:53.273 --> 14:55.265
Well now he's gonna have to
sleep on the street tonight.

14:55.290 --> 14:56.631
Are you okay with that?

14:56.655 --> 14:58.621
- No, of course not.
- So...

14:59.045 --> 15:00.654
Can we talk to him together?

15:00.679 --> 15:03.755
'Cause maybe he'll
open up with me there.

15:03.780 --> 15:06.949
- Let's give it a shot.
- Okay.

15:07.110 --> 15:10.812
Did you ever hear any of them
call each other by a name?

15:10.837 --> 15:13.004
Or a nickname?

15:16.336 --> 15:18.663
Look, you don't have
to be afraid anymore.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.935
You can help us catch them.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.573
Detective Lindsay's our friend.

15:23.820 --> 15:27.790
If you answer her questions,
she can keep you safe.

15:35.180 --> 15:38.282
It might be a small detail you remember.

15:38.307 --> 15:40.325
About the place that they kept you.

15:40.684 --> 15:43.819
A landmark or any unusual sounds.

15:43.844 --> 15:46.312
My stomach hurts.

15:52.346 --> 15:55.015
I'm gonna let you rest, okay?

15:55.040 --> 15:57.375
You can call me anytime.

16:00.745 --> 16:03.080
I'll be right back, Danny.

16:05.916 --> 16:07.290
He's not ready.

16:07.315 --> 16:09.287
He's obviously terrified.

16:09.312 --> 16:10.694
And I wish that I could help,

16:10.719 --> 16:12.839
but my hands are tied here.

16:13.135 --> 16:15.085
Let me know if he changes his mind.

16:15.110 --> 16:17.811
- Okay.
- Good luck.

16:23.472 --> 16:26.582
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:27.046 --> 16:29.648
So Tate stepped up.

16:29.786 --> 16:32.288
What made you finally
accept the man's proposal?

16:32.513 --> 16:35.350
He's been so great through everything.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.901
And now that it seems like

16:37.926 --> 16:41.952
the TB's gonna remain inactive, I...

16:42.204 --> 16:44.872
So you two resolved
all the other issues?

16:45.208 --> 16:46.575
Issues?

16:46.600 --> 16:49.102
You told me that he didn't
want you working anymore.

16:49.127 --> 16:52.194
That... that was just one time.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.250
You didn't discuss it?

16:55.340 --> 16:58.491
How about his ex-wife?
Or you becoming a stepmom?

16:58.516 --> 17:00.635
We talk about everything.

17:00.660 --> 17:02.647
And I love him. I mean, you don't...

17:02.672 --> 17:04.211
This is the happiest day of my life,

17:04.236 --> 17:05.470
and you're pissing on it.

17:05.494 --> 17:06.751
That's not what I'm doing.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.207
You know what? Next time you feel

17:08.232 --> 17:10.565
the need to weight in, don't.

17:12.961 --> 17:14.454
What?

17:15.463 --> 17:18.314
I thought I made it out of 'Nam alive.

17:18.752 --> 17:22.103
I didn't know there was a
40-year delay on that grenade.

17:22.127 --> 17:24.087
Don't talk like that, Reggie.

17:24.622 --> 17:26.390
I'm a newsman.

17:26.766 --> 17:29.061
Mordant humor comes with the job.

17:31.882 --> 17:34.743
Do you remember that time
we watched the sun rise

17:34.768 --> 17:36.649
- at Rainbow Beach?
- Yeah.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.759
- Stayed up all night.
- All night.

17:41.784 --> 17:44.206
It was good you brought
that flask of Hennessey

17:44.232 --> 17:46.933
- to keep us warm.
- Corrupting a minor.

17:46.958 --> 17:47.778
Indeed.

17:50.798 --> 17:54.363
Listen, about when you left...

17:54.388 --> 17:56.847
Shh.

17:58.242 --> 18:02.245
We were just in different
places in our lives.

18:02.270 --> 18:04.879
Chalk it up to bad timing.

18:05.235 --> 18:09.103
I heard through the grapevine

18:09.128 --> 18:11.141
that you got married.

18:11.166 --> 18:15.103
I did. We had a good run.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.119
But now we're separated.

18:17.144 --> 18:19.382
I'm really sorry about that.

18:20.073 --> 18:21.800
Maybe...

18:22.481 --> 18:24.828
Maybe our timing

18:25.413 --> 18:28.668
will be better this go-round.

18:33.117 --> 18:34.651
Sharon.

18:34.676 --> 18:36.596
Reggie?

18:38.769 --> 18:39.964
Reggie?

18:39.989 --> 18:41.878
I can't...

18:43.404 --> 18:46.533
I need some help in here!

18:48.746 --> 18:50.598
BP's diving. What happened?

18:50.623 --> 18:52.122
Gastric hemorrhage.

18:52.147 --> 18:53.414
Let's get him on the rapid transfuser.

18:53.439 --> 18:54.664
Two of red cells, two of plasma

18:54.689 --> 18:56.341
- and a five pack of platelets.
- I need an NG tube.

18:56.366 --> 18:57.269
Got it.

18:57.293 --> 18:58.969
Here, Nat.

18:58.994 --> 19:00.737
Excuse me.

19:15.663 --> 19:17.598
- I need cold saline.
- Yes, Doctor.

19:17.623 --> 19:18.605
Reggie?

19:18.630 --> 19:20.890
Reggie, stay with me, I'm here.

19:29.183 --> 19:31.266
- It's not clearing.
- Start a PPI drip,

19:31.291 --> 19:32.623
vasopressin and page GI.

19:32.648 --> 19:33.862
We need to get control of this bleed.

19:33.887 --> 19:35.854
On it.

19:51.514 --> 19:53.586
GI's got his bleeding When
push comesunder control,

19:53.611 --> 19:55.612
but his sats are down to 88.

19:55.646 --> 19:57.152
His lungs are deteriorating.

19:57.177 --> 20:00.043
- So what now?
- We'll see how he responds

20:00.068 --> 20:01.561
to the inhaled nitric oxide.

20:01.585 --> 20:04.521
He's on a PEEP of 10.
There's still room to increase.

20:04.642 --> 20:05.932
If his sats don't improve,

20:05.957 --> 20:07.858
we might consider a paralytic drip.

20:07.883 --> 20:10.817
So we do still have some options.

20:10.997 --> 20:13.499
Why don't we put him on ECMO?

20:13.597 --> 20:15.826
I don't...
I don't want to speak for Dr. Choi,

20:15.851 --> 20:18.530
but while putting him on
ECMO might protect his lungs,

20:18.555 --> 20:20.293
it wouldn't be addressing
the inflammation

20:20.318 --> 20:21.519
affecting the rest of his organs.

20:21.544 --> 20:23.893
I agree. ECMO might
buy us a little time,

20:23.927 --> 20:26.461
but it won't help him fight
off the hyperinfection.

20:26.486 --> 20:29.092
So you're against it. Both of you.

20:29.117 --> 20:30.540
- Yeah.
- That's right.

20:30.990 --> 20:32.946
See what else you can come up with.

20:32.971 --> 20:34.353
It'd be nice to get ahead of this thing

20:34.378 --> 20:37.821
instead of always playing from behind.

20:49.750 --> 20:50.704
Hey Dr. Charles,

20:50.729 --> 20:52.128
I just got off the
phone with cardiology.

20:52.153 --> 20:54.243
Your patient, Pamela,
they just confirmed,

20:54.268 --> 20:56.386
- endocarditis.
- Hey, um,

20:56.411 --> 20:58.082
they putting her on antibiotics?

20:58.106 --> 21:00.073
No, the plan is to
remove the vegetations,

21:00.098 --> 21:01.898
and reconstruct her aorta.

21:01.923 --> 21:03.907
She's going into surgery now.

21:03.932 --> 21:06.934
Surgery? Who authorized that?

21:09.790 --> 21:12.174
Hey, Dr. Vanilla Latte.

21:12.293 --> 21:14.879
I need to collect another
blood sample from Pamela.

21:14.904 --> 21:16.443
I can't grow a decent culture.

21:16.468 --> 21:18.001
I can do you one better. I can get you

21:18.026 --> 21:21.161
- the infected valve itself.
- Great. I'm scrubbing in.

21:21.186 --> 21:22.402
Once again we're in the same place

21:22.427 --> 21:24.094
at the same time,
wanting the same thing.

21:24.119 --> 21:25.730
Would you care to run that
through your calculator?

21:26.029 --> 21:27.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

21:27.775 --> 21:30.144
Evidently there's an issue with consent.

21:30.169 --> 21:32.708
- Surgery's been cancelled.
- Cancelled by who?

21:32.733 --> 21:34.742
By me.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.928
Hey, Pamela.

21:40.523 --> 21:42.580
Now I laid out everything for her.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.643
I explained the risks, her alternative.

21:44.668 --> 21:46.969
I have her signature right here.

21:46.994 --> 21:49.037
- That scrawl?
- It doesn't matter if you

21:49.062 --> 21:51.029
approve of her penmanship,
I have her consent.

21:51.054 --> 21:52.519
Not her informed consent.

21:52.543 --> 21:54.720
She's way too impaired to make
that kind of decision right now.

21:54.745 --> 21:56.499
So you're gonna make
the decision for her?

21:56.524 --> 21:59.292
We can't get the consent
that you're insisting on

21:59.317 --> 22:01.351
without first performing surgery.

22:01.376 --> 22:02.844
Sounds like a catch-22.

22:02.869 --> 22:05.704
She needs the surgery.
It's urgent and necessary.

22:05.729 --> 22:07.296
Of course you think
that, you're a surgeon.

22:07.321 --> 22:09.900
- Your inherent bias is to cut.
- What about you, the shrink?

22:09.925 --> 22:11.315
You don't have a bias?

22:11.340 --> 22:13.215
Well I'm not afraid to
admit that I'm biased.

22:13.240 --> 22:15.141
My job gets a lot easier
if I can get my hands

22:15.166 --> 22:16.900
- on that infected valve.
- You know what?

22:16.925 --> 22:19.326
Unfortunately, not
really open for debate.

22:19.351 --> 22:23.077
Performing surgery without
actual informed consent

22:23.102 --> 22:24.592
is by law, assault.

22:24.617 --> 22:26.088
I mean, you should thank me, Doctor.

22:26.113 --> 22:27.559
I'm trying to save you
a lot of legal bills.

22:27.584 --> 22:29.715
Well, Dr. Charles,
I hope that when you're done

22:29.740 --> 22:32.892
trying to prove a point,
I still have time to save her.

22:33.121 --> 22:35.357
Now, if you'll excuse me.

22:41.484 --> 22:44.152
I'm gonna need to remove that, okay?

22:45.899 --> 22:48.501
All right. Do your thing, Doc.

22:52.131 --> 22:55.233
Looks like
the bleeding subsided.

22:55.258 --> 22:56.688
Hey, what do you call that thing again?

22:56.713 --> 22:58.742
- A Rhino Rocket.
- Cool.

22:58.767 --> 23:00.034
All right, what do I owe you?

23:00.059 --> 23:02.234
- $350, flat rate.
- Sounds fair to me.

23:02.259 --> 23:04.531
- You got a Square?
- Sure do.

23:05.161 --> 23:08.232
Now before we finish up,
have you gone swimming lately?

23:08.257 --> 23:09.991
Specifically in fresh water?

23:10.016 --> 23:12.704
Yeah, I got a couple acres
lakeside up in Lake Geneva.

23:12.729 --> 23:13.836
- Why?
- Yeah, I'd like to bring you

23:13.861 --> 23:15.529
back to the ED with us for more tests.

23:15.554 --> 23:17.318
Wait, the hospital?

23:17.396 --> 23:20.707
Guys, I'm kinda busy here.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.098
I thought we got this all fixed up.

23:22.123 --> 23:25.596
We did, probably,
and I'm 95% sure it isn't serious.

23:25.623 --> 23:27.591
- What isn't serious?
- Well there's an infection

23:27.616 --> 23:29.992
I'd like to rule out, naeglariasis.

23:30.017 --> 23:32.301
And that's extremely unlikely.

23:32.326 --> 23:36.195
Excuse me, Dr. Halstead,
can I speak with you for a moment?

23:37.954 --> 23:39.621
Excuse us.

23:46.303 --> 23:49.614
Really,
you think he caught a warm water amoeba

23:49.639 --> 23:52.477
in a Wisconsin lake in October?

23:52.502 --> 23:54.744
Tell me it hasn't been
unseasonably hot lately.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.176
And it would explain the
persistent nose bleeds.

23:57.201 --> 24:00.003
But this app is about convenience.

24:00.071 --> 24:02.487
Dragging our customers into the E.D.

24:02.512 --> 24:04.663
cuts against the value
proposition, okay?

24:04.688 --> 24:06.458
First rule of customer service:

24:06.483 --> 24:09.157
a satisfied customer tells two people.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.200
A dissatisfied one tells 2,000.

24:11.225 --> 24:13.026
I minored in econ, Noah, I get it.

24:13.051 --> 24:15.435
But surely what our customers
want above anything else

24:15.460 --> 24:16.826
is to get better, no?

24:18.278 --> 24:19.812
- Of course, but...
- Not to mention

24:19.837 --> 24:21.729
if we suspect something
and don't test for it.

24:21.891 --> 24:23.625
Talk about liability.

24:23.708 --> 24:25.308
A brain-eating amoeba?

24:25.397 --> 24:27.587
You really think I might have this?

24:34.952 --> 24:37.147
You didn't find me

24:37.172 --> 24:38.505
a place to stay.

24:38.530 --> 24:41.262
No. Not yet.

24:41.555 --> 24:44.089
I'm gonna recommend
admitting you for the night

24:44.114 --> 24:46.148
if the pain in your
stomach doesn't subside.

24:46.189 --> 24:48.753
My stomach's actually
feeling a little better.

24:49.530 --> 24:53.266
If anyone asks,
just keep saying that it hurts.

24:53.404 --> 24:55.482
...are you angry with me?

24:55.507 --> 24:58.951
What?
No... no, I just want you to stay safe.

25:00.888 --> 25:03.023
I'll, I'll check
back in with you soon.

25:03.048 --> 25:05.032
I have... I have an idea.

25:05.976 --> 25:08.177
I could stay at your place tonight.

25:08.520 --> 25:11.027
If... if you're worried about me using,
then don't be.

25:11.052 --> 25:12.150
I'm totally clean.

25:12.175 --> 25:15.177
I... I could sleep on the couch.
Or the floor, even.

25:15.202 --> 25:17.684
You'd hardly even know I was there.

25:19.316 --> 25:22.152
Danny, I don't...

25:22.305 --> 25:24.131
I get it.

25:24.478 --> 25:26.146
- Never mind.
- No, no, no.

25:26.171 --> 25:27.561
You just, you caught me off guard.

25:27.586 --> 25:29.212
No, please, I've seen that look before.

25:30.043 --> 25:33.331
You don't want someone like
me staying at your place.

25:33.356 --> 25:35.646
- I'm trash.
- No.

25:35.671 --> 25:37.593
The hospital has strict policies

25:37.626 --> 25:39.560
about doctor-patient relationships,

25:39.585 --> 25:42.252
and I'm just a first-year resident.

25:45.316 --> 25:49.047
I will figure something out, okay?

25:49.329 --> 25:51.564
Okay.

25:58.804 --> 26:00.705
There you go.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.564
Okay.

26:02.599 --> 26:04.870
Okay, let's lift. Yep.

26:04.895 --> 26:07.196
Hey, don't move him like that.

26:07.221 --> 26:10.227
If you want him more upright,
adjust the bed.

26:10.252 --> 26:12.554
- I'm sorry, Ms. Goodwin.
- I'll do it myself.

26:12.579 --> 26:15.414
I'm gonna go check on
the latest blood gas.

26:17.644 --> 26:20.846
I've never seen Goodwin
like this before.

26:22.920 --> 26:26.889
Nat, all I know is that
when Sharon was graduating

26:26.914 --> 26:29.603
from high school,
Reggie came back from 'Nam.

26:29.628 --> 26:32.696
They practically spent the
entire summer together.

26:33.409 --> 26:35.660
It was her first real love.

26:35.685 --> 26:37.419
So why didn't it work out?

26:37.444 --> 26:39.845
Well, Reggie wanted her to
travel the world with him.

26:39.870 --> 26:42.664
But... but Sharon was going
to college in the fall.

26:42.689 --> 26:46.531
And then Bert came
along and it was just...

26:46.556 --> 26:48.632
If you had listened to me earlier,

26:48.657 --> 26:51.129
we wouldn't be out of options.

26:51.154 --> 26:53.686
- I'm sorry, Ms. Goodwin.
- What's going on?

26:53.711 --> 26:56.333
The infiltrate's in Reggie's lungs.

26:57.263 --> 27:00.204
- Complete white out.
- They're barely functioning.

27:00.229 --> 27:02.242
- So what do we do now?
- Ms. Goodwin,

27:02.267 --> 27:03.491
the condition his lungs are in,

27:03.516 --> 27:05.142
there's very little hope for recovery.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.414
We should try to make him comfortable.

27:06.439 --> 27:08.586
- What about ECMO?
- I'm afraid all ECMO will do

27:08.612 --> 27:10.371
is delay the inevitable.

27:10.396 --> 27:14.436
I have been listening
to your advice all day,

27:14.727 --> 27:16.220
and look where we are.

27:16.245 --> 27:17.591
Ms. Goodwin,

27:17.616 --> 27:20.388
all due respect, both Dr. Manning and I

27:20.412 --> 27:21.931
are telling you that
it isn't gonna help.

27:21.957 --> 27:24.751
Your concerns are noted, Dr. Choi.

27:24.776 --> 27:27.410
Put him on ECMO.

27:28.670 --> 27:31.787
I can assign this case
to another doctor,

27:31.812 --> 27:33.987
- if you prefer.
- Sharon.

27:37.415 --> 27:39.784
- We'll do it.
- What?

27:39.809 --> 27:41.714
We will put Reggie on ECMO.

27:41.739 --> 27:43.306
Call up to the ICU.

27:43.331 --> 27:45.811
I'll take care of the
arrangements myself.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.221
- Thank you, April.
- Yeah.

28:00.783 --> 28:02.722
Hey, what did Dr.
Halstead order in there?

28:02.747 --> 28:05.851
CBC, metabolic panel, a urinalysis,

28:05.876 --> 28:07.797
- sed rate and a head CT.
- Man.

28:07.822 --> 28:09.608
Can we scale that back?

28:09.633 --> 28:12.008
Or is there some kind
of employee discount

28:12.033 --> 28:13.392
I'm eligible for?

28:13.417 --> 28:15.485
It's not coming out
of your pocket, is it?

28:15.609 --> 28:17.096
It's gonna come out of somebody's.

28:17.121 --> 28:18.640
Well, talk to Will about it.

28:18.665 --> 28:20.399
I already tried.

28:20.424 --> 28:23.198
You know, why'd I think
it'd be a good idea

28:23.223 --> 28:24.557
to hire my attending, you know?

28:24.582 --> 28:25.711
How am I gonna be his boss

28:25.735 --> 28:27.536
when he knows more about
medicine than I do?

28:27.561 --> 28:29.109
It looks like he's getting
along with your client

28:29.134 --> 28:31.058
- really well.
- We'll see.

28:31.083 --> 28:33.338
I've gotta work on my managerial skills.

28:35.361 --> 28:37.961
Wait a second. Is that...

28:38.370 --> 28:40.832
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

28:44.043 --> 28:46.831
This is... this is huge.

28:46.856 --> 28:48.827
No, what is he up to now?

28:50.057 --> 28:53.084
Um, let's celebrate later, okay?

28:53.109 --> 28:55.086
- Okay.
- All right.

28:55.398 --> 28:57.799
- Ooh!
- Excuse me, sorry.

28:57.824 --> 29:01.231
April, listen. About earlier, sorry.

29:01.436 --> 29:03.684
- Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

29:03.895 --> 29:07.621
No, really.

29:07.948 --> 29:09.862
It's not the first time my
mouth's gotten me into trouble.

29:09.887 --> 29:10.700
I shouldn't have said anything.

29:10.725 --> 29:12.438
I was just trying to protect you.

29:13.194 --> 29:15.496
I've had so long to think about this,

29:15.609 --> 29:19.100
and what Tate and I have is real.

29:19.744 --> 29:23.305
Well, okay. In that
case, if you need anyone

29:23.330 --> 29:27.098
to go dress shopping
with, I'm available.

29:34.067 --> 29:36.595
Danny wants to stay at your place.

29:37.135 --> 29:38.836
- Yeah.
- Well, I mean,

29:38.861 --> 29:39.810
makes perfect sense, right?

29:39.836 --> 29:41.779
I mean,
now that he's free of the traffickers,

29:41.804 --> 29:43.004
there's this big void in his life,

29:43.029 --> 29:44.490
which he wants to fill with you.

29:44.801 --> 29:47.322
Obviously, it can't be entertained.

29:47.669 --> 29:50.844
Then again, rejecting him
now could just be reinforcing

29:50.869 --> 29:53.408
the abandonment issues
he's already feeling.

29:54.544 --> 29:55.927
Wait.

29:57.331 --> 29:59.130
Did you come here to ask my permission?

29:59.155 --> 30:01.485
The system's incapable of
keeping a roof over his head.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.824
We can't let him sleep on the streets,
it's too dangerous.

30:03.849 --> 30:06.673
- It'd be just for the one night.
- Dr. Reese,

30:06.698 --> 30:09.183
having a patient stay in your home?

30:09.208 --> 30:10.864
Maintaining professional boundaries

30:10.888 --> 30:12.846
is a fundamental part of our work.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.043
Again, to protect both our patients...

30:15.068 --> 30:17.782
I'm sorry,
but I don't see any other options.

30:18.028 --> 30:19.543
Sarah.

30:20.702 --> 30:22.454
Sarah!

30:28.772 --> 30:30.945
- Sarah.
- Hey, does this look like

30:30.970 --> 30:33.105
- it'll fit Danny?
- I guess... listen, about Danny...

30:33.130 --> 30:35.342
Could you do me a favor?
See if they have any

30:35.367 --> 30:37.520
extra blankets in the store room,
I wanna take some home.

30:43.481 --> 30:45.096
- Where is he?
- I'm sorry,

30:45.121 --> 30:47.168
I tried to stop him,
but he was so desperate

30:47.193 --> 30:48.600
to get out of here.

30:48.629 --> 30:50.343
Did he say where he was going?

30:50.368 --> 30:53.422
Just said that he was going
back where he belongs.

31:05.342 --> 31:06.814
He's gone.

31:06.839 --> 31:09.741
I never should have hesitated.

31:15.863 --> 31:18.218
I knew it wouldn't help and so did you.

31:19.348 --> 31:21.290
I figured we had safety in numbers.

31:21.315 --> 31:22.754
I know.

31:23.884 --> 31:27.954
But if we'd had an alternative
plan to save his life,

31:28.070 --> 31:30.819
yeah, I would've held firm with you.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.715
But we didn't.

31:33.834 --> 31:36.098
So we tried the Hail Mary.

31:36.422 --> 31:39.776
And Goodwin knows that we did
everything we could for her.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.371
For her?

31:42.255 --> 31:44.651
Goodwin's not our patient, Reggie is.

31:46.125 --> 31:47.759
Right now, he's suffering.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.945
Best thing we could've done for him

31:50.306 --> 31:52.465
is to let him die with dignity.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.352
Ms. Goodwin?

32:08.734 --> 32:11.208
You here to tell me my options?

32:11.457 --> 32:13.959
I just wanted to know
if you needed anything.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.983
No. I'm fine.

32:17.708 --> 32:19.242
Okay.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.223
What is about

32:21.803 --> 32:24.268
first love that just...

32:26.136 --> 32:27.966
Sticks with you?

32:29.012 --> 32:31.735
It's like... it's like

32:31.760 --> 32:33.919
those last 40 years

32:33.944 --> 32:35.759
don't even exist.

32:36.265 --> 32:38.465
One day he's saying goodbye to me,
and the next,

32:38.490 --> 32:40.871
he's showing up here on a gurney.

32:45.738 --> 32:47.597
Reggie Dixon.

32:51.298 --> 32:54.949
These machines aren't gonna save him.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.868
- No.
- No.

32:59.601 --> 33:02.216
Yeah.

33:03.992 --> 33:07.061
Excuse me, Ms. Goodwin?

33:26.191 --> 33:27.486
I've collected two signatures.

33:27.511 --> 33:28.770
One from my attending, Dr. Latham.

33:28.795 --> 33:31.386
The other from Dr. Walters,
Director of Cardiology.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.111
I don't care if you have 200 signatures,

33:33.136 --> 33:35.691
it doesn't change the fact
the patient is too impaired

33:35.716 --> 33:37.210
to consent to a high-risk surgery.

33:37.235 --> 33:39.137
They were both willing
to sign their names

33:39.162 --> 33:41.372
to the opinion that
Pamela's surgery is indeed

33:41.397 --> 33:43.014
both urgent and necessary.

33:43.039 --> 33:44.575
This is a blatant end around.

33:44.600 --> 33:47.527
It's just legal cover to keep
us all from getting sued.

33:47.552 --> 33:49.647
Am I actually the only
person who's got this girl's

33:49.672 --> 33:52.040
- best interests at heart?
- Are you sure the surgery

33:52.074 --> 33:53.723
- is the best course of action?
- Yes.

33:53.748 --> 33:55.494
And you're confident you can fix it?

33:55.519 --> 33:56.854
- I am.
- Then go do it.

33:56.879 --> 33:59.041
Thank you, Ms. Goodwin.

34:00.509 --> 34:03.754
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you kidding me, Sharon?

34:03.779 --> 34:05.362
You're gonna let a couple of surgeons

34:05.387 --> 34:06.672
tell you who's mentally competent?

34:06.697 --> 34:08.983
I'm the Chief Psychiatrist
in the building.

34:09.007 --> 34:11.713
It's a double doc.
That overrides you, Daniel.

34:11.737 --> 34:14.504
So we're just running this
hospital by majority rule, now?

34:14.529 --> 34:17.063
No, no, no. But after the day I've had,

34:17.088 --> 34:19.614
I'm wary of challenging
the collective wisdom

34:19.639 --> 34:21.793
- of our doctors.
- Okay, okay.

34:21.819 --> 34:24.792
So let's just set the
law aside, for now.

34:24.817 --> 34:27.455
Are we abandoning the ethical
argument altogether as well?

34:27.480 --> 34:29.145
It's done, Daniel.

34:29.170 --> 34:33.605
If you want to file a complaint,
be my guest.

34:39.222 --> 34:42.110
Kaplan, Eliot, good news.

34:42.135 --> 34:45.036
Test came back negative.
You don't have naeglariasis.

34:45.105 --> 34:47.235
My brain's not being eaten by an amoeba.

34:47.309 --> 34:48.426
I guess that's a good thing.

34:48.451 --> 34:49.204
Yeah.

34:49.228 --> 34:51.463
We're all about customer satisfaction.

34:51.954 --> 34:55.339
Okay, so all in, it comes to comes to

34:55.513 --> 34:59.116
$2,134.68.

34:59.192 --> 35:01.911
You told me it would be $350.

35:02.292 --> 35:04.650
Well, there was the,
um, the blood panel.

35:04.675 --> 35:08.010
Urinalysis, CT Scan.

35:08.035 --> 35:09.550
It's all in our terms and conditions.

35:09.575 --> 35:10.745
No, wait a minute. You're upcharging me

35:10.770 --> 35:12.009
for something I don't even have.

35:12.034 --> 35:14.131
Well it's a good thing
we ran those tests.

35:14.156 --> 35:17.040
We did find your liver function
markers slightly elevated.

35:17.195 --> 35:19.696
Now a good excuse to cut
back on your alcohol intake.

35:19.721 --> 35:21.919
Now you're telling me I'm an alcoholic.

35:22.332 --> 35:25.168
Just get me out of here. Okay?

35:25.594 --> 35:27.911
Okay, um.

35:30.538 --> 35:32.642
Would you like me to
email you the receipt?

35:32.667 --> 35:34.257
See that?

35:34.671 --> 35:38.176
Congratulations. You
just went anti-viral.

35:41.563 --> 35:43.531
I didn't expect that.

35:45.437 --> 35:47.237
I thought he'd be relieved.

35:48.309 --> 35:51.108
Yeah, it's...it's hard.

35:51.906 --> 35:53.916
Concierge patients.

35:54.276 --> 35:58.212
You know,
you were just trying to be thorough.

35:58.239 --> 36:01.916
Yeah, thanks. Listen, Noah,
I appreciate the opportunity,

36:01.941 --> 36:05.054
but maybe this just isn't for me.

36:05.364 --> 36:07.719
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:08.170 --> 36:10.288
Damn, I'm sorry to hear that.

36:10.743 --> 36:12.384
I... if I'm leaving you in a tight spot,

36:12.409 --> 36:14.022
I can stay on until you find someone...

36:14.047 --> 36:15.268
No, no.

36:15.405 --> 36:18.659
I appreciate it, but I...
I think I can handle it.

36:30.938 --> 36:32.356
Pamela?

36:33.995 --> 36:36.193
Pamela Blake. How you doing?

36:36.218 --> 36:37.612
I just came to

36:37.636 --> 36:39.711
see how everything was going.

36:40.102 --> 36:42.766
- Much better, thank you.
- Great.

36:42.836 --> 36:44.749
I'm really glad to hear it.

36:46.158 --> 36:47.862
I'm sorry, you are?

36:48.928 --> 36:51.196
I'm Dr. Charles. Daniel.

36:51.424 --> 36:54.763
We, um, we met earlier today
when you got to the hospital.

36:54.788 --> 36:56.132
You remember?

36:56.956 --> 36:59.157
Yeah. Right, yeah.

36:59.328 --> 37:03.669
Yeah. Okay, well,
I'm happy to see you're doing so well.

37:10.795 --> 37:12.695
Glad to see she's finally coming around.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.136
Yeah.

37:17.016 --> 37:18.683
We're gonna have to agree
to disagree on this one,

37:18.708 --> 37:20.474
- aren't we?
- Yeah, we can just

37:20.499 --> 37:22.357
disagree, too, that'd be all right.

37:24.784 --> 37:28.048
Hey Connor, the lab ID'd the bacteria

37:28.073 --> 37:29.354
from her infected valve.

37:29.734 --> 37:31.473
Q fever?

37:31.534 --> 37:34.085
She works on a dairy farm
down-state on weekends.

37:35.565 --> 37:37.847
I'm heading down to the
cafeteria to write up my report

37:37.872 --> 37:39.840
for the health department.

37:39.930 --> 37:41.523
If you're free, I was hoping you might

37:41.548 --> 37:43.208
help me fill in a few details.

37:43.232 --> 37:47.352
Yeah,
I just have to sign over a few patients.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.568
I'll, um,

37:49.693 --> 37:52.143
- meet you down there in ten?
- Great.

38:01.338 --> 38:03.741
You wanted to know why I
broke up with my boyfriend.

38:03.766 --> 38:07.390
He was too soft. He rolled
over every time we had a fight.

38:07.661 --> 38:10.836
But that guy, though. Oof.

38:10.993 --> 38:13.062
Anyway, I better get downstairs.

38:13.094 --> 38:14.983
See you later?

38:23.138 --> 38:25.143
Are you ready?

38:39.878 --> 38:43.200
Time of death, 20:53.

39:20.155 --> 39:22.285
Hey, hear anything
from Detective Lindsay?

39:22.310 --> 39:24.536
- Not yet.
- Hang in there.

39:24.561 --> 39:26.477
The kid's a survivor. PD will find him.

39:26.624 --> 39:29.249
I'm not just gonna sit
around and do nothing.

39:29.274 --> 39:31.006
Well you're gonna go
out looking for him?

39:31.282 --> 39:32.811
Come on, Sarah, it's a big city.

39:32.836 --> 39:34.186
Sarah.

39:37.194 --> 39:39.068
Give me a minute.

39:39.415 --> 39:41.051
I'll come with you.

39:47.425 --> 39:50.990
- He offered me stock options.
- Stock options?

39:51.015 --> 39:53.283
- And you turned him down?
- Yeah, I know.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.597
I'm kind of kicking myself a little,

39:54.622 --> 39:56.789
but it's not for me.

39:56.824 --> 39:58.625
I'll figure out another
way to make some cash.

39:58.650 --> 40:00.620
Well, or just save some.

40:01.985 --> 40:05.509
- How about you move in with me?
- Lena, come on.

40:05.633 --> 40:07.990
I appreciate the offer, but if I'm gonna

40:08.015 --> 40:10.485
move in with you,
I don't want it to be because of money.

40:10.510 --> 40:12.389
It's not about the money.

40:13.566 --> 40:15.814
It's because I really think

40:15.839 --> 40:17.125
this has a chance to work.

40:19.012 --> 40:21.224
So what do you say?

40:22.385 --> 40:24.969
I am so happy for you guys.

40:29.479 --> 40:31.179
- It's $8.50.
- Thanks.

40:31.204 --> 40:32.978
- Thank you.
- Let me give you a hand.

40:33.003 --> 40:34.317
All right.

40:34.679 --> 40:38.180
Hey, April, you okay?

40:41.425 --> 40:42.654
You sure?

40:52.211 --> 40:53.982
Hey, hey, hey.

40:55.970 --> 40:59.584
April, you're burning up.

41:29.717 --> 41:32.992
- Sorry.
- All right, thank you.

41:38.172 --> 41:40.067
Thank you.
