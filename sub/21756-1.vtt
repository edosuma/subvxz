WEBVTT

02:22.610 --> 02:23.544
John.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.180
Anthony.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.014
John.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.652
Now is not a good time.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.536
How the hell are ya, John?

02:49.470 --> 02:50.304
You all right?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.905
You, uh, fucked up?

02:53.441 --> 02:55.443
I mean, I know I'm a bit fucked up,

02:55.543 --> 02:57.745
but it's just the whiskey.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.214
I imagine you are fucked up

03:00.314 --> 03:03.217
in a whole different kinda way, huh?

03:05.353 --> 03:06.454
I'm fine, Anthony.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.357
I just need to get back to my work.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.191
Oh yeah?

03:12.460 --> 03:14.695
What page are you on, John?

03:18.732 --> 03:19.467
Huh?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.637
I just reached page 40.

03:24.938 --> 03:25.773
I believe.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.876
Yes.

03:28.976 --> 03:32.346
One of the companions is missing.

03:32.446 --> 03:33.447
And so is his knife.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.016
So yes, I just reached page 40.

03:42.890 --> 03:43.624
I see.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.697
Okay, John.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.409
I thought you'd be special.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.348
But I'm afraid your time is up.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.455
What can I say?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.958
I'm very sorry.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.060
I just reached page 40.

04:23.096 --> 04:27.301
You've been on page 40
for six goddamn weeks.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.135
What?

04:29.202 --> 04:30.037
No.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.873
No, it can't have been.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.208
I don't have that much time.

04:39.647 --> 04:44.084
But Lamont says it's time
for the book to move on.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.154
Wouldn't do that, Anthony.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.922
It doesn't like violence.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.329
Well then, it's gonna hate me.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.300
God damnit, John.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.938
You are past page 40.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.407
Oh look, you're right.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.240
Page 43.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.644
Fuck you.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.879
It would be painless.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.585
Or so it keeps telling me.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.090
Fuck you, John.

05:23.190 --> 05:26.760
- Son of a...
- If only there was a quicker way.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.498
To just skip to the end.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.784
Your device storage is full.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.753
Create cloud storage?

05:52.853 --> 05:55.322
Private journal from Luke Harding.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.392
This is for whoever reads the book next.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.961
I'm not sure how I've made it this far,

06:01.061 --> 06:05.132
but maybe my story will help
you reach the end of yours.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.104
How did this all start?

06:11.204 --> 06:15.676
I guess you need to know
how I ended up with the book.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.412
I need to back up a couple of cases,

06:18.512 --> 06:23.283
when I first started
working for Mr. Fairweather.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.819
I thought it was
a simple surveillance job.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.821
Follow 10 people.

06:27.921 --> 06:32.159
And catch them doing
something just a little dirty.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.327
It sounded simple enough.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.898
Hell, I'd already knocked off
the first eight.

06:37.998 --> 06:41.401
But the ninth was
a well-respected priest.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.606
I really thought this one
would take awhile.

06:45.706 --> 06:49.209
But I was forgetting what
side of the tracks I was on.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.944
Prostitution is immoral.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.112
Proverb 23:27.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.283
For a prostitute is a deviant
and an adulteress.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.660
Let's say I give you
the candy 'round back

07:06.760 --> 07:09.329
and then call it a night.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.265
I was so close to a payday.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.467
But what I didn't realize

07:14.668 --> 07:18.005
was something really valuable
was passing through town.

07:21.374 --> 07:25.445
My employer was about to make
a very dangerous power play.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.084
And there I was,

07:31.184 --> 07:33.821
about to walk right into
the middle of it all.

07:33.921 --> 07:36.690
I had to keep my tail between my legs.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.193
Because as easy as the first nine
on my list had been,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.162
the 10th had proven impossible.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.564
Let's go.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.834
It was time to have an audience

07:46.934 --> 07:48.969
with Mr. Fairweather,

07:49.069 --> 07:51.304
a wrestling promoter turned crook.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.815
The champ had arrived.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.752
Scotty was Fairweather's right hand man.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.419
We went back.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.590
We had been friends and
enemies several times.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.592
I wasn't sure where
the scorecard had left off

08:11.692 --> 08:14.695
when Scotty introduced me
to Fairweather.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.030
And I was too broke to care.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.477
Looking forward to tonight, man.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.179
So there's two things, all right.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.013
Two things.

08:34.114 --> 08:37.183
I'm gonna give your guys a throw down.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.587
Are you in the show?

08:39.687 --> 08:40.419
Pardon?

08:41.321 --> 08:43.823
Oh, are you working with Fairweather?

08:43.924 --> 08:45.158
I work for myself.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.960
Me, I'm both.

08:47.060 --> 08:47.828
You doing a list?

08:47.928 --> 08:48.962
You know, basic shit.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.832
Try to find a little dirt
on each person.

08:51.932 --> 08:52.800
Yeah, throw down...

08:52.900 --> 08:55.803
Hey, who took my fuckin' cheese grater?

08:55.903 --> 08:56.704
Was it fuckin' you?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.538
Take it easy, Ferox.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.442
Mr. Fairweather will see you now.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.956
Mr. Luke Harding.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.860
I gotta tell ya, I got
a five year old niece

09:19.960 --> 09:23.363
who could fly a drone better than you.

09:23.463 --> 09:26.066
But you got what I needed
for that guy, so.

09:26.166 --> 09:26.900
Good.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.369
I just got one

09:30.938 --> 09:34.775
glaringly obvious thing
the discuss here.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.544
Seeing as how I gave you
a list with 10 names on it.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.411
I know, but...

09:38.511 --> 09:40.748
Now, I ain't no math magician,

09:40.848 --> 09:42.315
but I'm only seeing

09:44.251 --> 09:46.286
nine files here.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.120
Yo Larry.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.021
Yes, sir.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.590
If I was to ask you for, say,

09:52.459 --> 09:53.761
10 cigars,

09:53.861 --> 09:55.095
what would you do?

09:55.195 --> 09:57.765
Bring you 10 cigars, Mr. Fairweather.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.667
And if you only came back with nine?

09:59.767 --> 10:00.834
Oh no.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.536
I'd never come back with only nine, sir.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.573
You see, Luke, that's why Larry

10:06.674 --> 10:10.911
is wearing more expensive
shoes than you are.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.112
Why he smells better.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.381
Why he has a nicer haircut.

10:15.415 --> 10:16.316
Why there's

10:17.885 --> 10:20.287
pussy hanging off him all the time.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.354
Because Larry

10:23.323 --> 10:26.093
knows how to fucking count to 10!

10:28.929 --> 10:29.763
Look,

10:31.231 --> 10:34.501
I followed that Gary Huang guy
for a month.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.502
Kid's clean.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.808
So you're going to bat for
this Squeaky McClean?

10:40.908 --> 10:41.641
Yes.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.711
So I'm paying you to tell me

10:43.811 --> 10:46.914
that this kid could be standing
at the gates of heaven,

10:47.014 --> 10:50.050
and God himself wouldn't
find the parking ticket.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.351
Yes.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.451
And even with our contract,

10:52.452 --> 10:53.687
that states you only pay 1/2.

10:53.787 --> 10:57.290
I know our fucking
contract, Mr. Harding.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.161
And believe me,

11:01.261 --> 11:03.831
it was a one time thing.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.398
Now get the hell outta my office.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.399
Actually, I was hoping

11:06.499 --> 11:07.533
- to get that 1/2 now.
- When Mr. Fairweather

11:07.534 --> 11:10.203
says it's time to go, it's time to go.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.173
If you don't mind, I have some bills.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.374
Yeah, if I don't mind.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.642
Suddenly you're all detente.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.544
If you don't mind, Mr. Fairweather,

11:17.644 --> 11:19.679
if you don't mind, Mr. Fairweather.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.214
Well, I mind.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.582
For fuck's sake.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.685
What the fuck am I paying ya for?

11:25.786 --> 11:27.955
Gimme a runway, god damnit.

11:31.558 --> 11:32.392
Okay.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.829
Here's your salary.

11:49.877 --> 11:53.113
You're a miserable failure, Harding.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.016
Please welcome to the stage, Ruby Reds.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.789
Happy birthday to me.

12:01.889 --> 12:06.326
Time for my annual email
from my father's estate.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.796
He paid to record dozens
of messages for me

12:08.896 --> 12:10.297
from his deathbed.

12:12.099 --> 12:14.467
It was the greatest gift of all,

12:14.567 --> 12:16.804
a reminder that he was dead.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.914
So, son, it's your 37th birthday.

12:28.381 --> 12:31.051
You were my one chance for a legacy.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.119
Hey.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.539
And look what I got to work with.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.521
Two shots, whiskey.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.157
You miserable excuse for a human being.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.691
Thanks for asking, dad.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.862
Now, I know that life
has probably chewed you up

12:41.962 --> 12:43.463
and spit you out a few times.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.865
Angelina's doing just fine.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.666
You were the most pointless part

12:46.766 --> 12:48.836
- of my existence.
- I don't see her much, but...

12:48.936 --> 12:51.038
Your whore of a mother
hated every second of you.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.272
I try to be there for her.

12:52.372 --> 12:56.009
And she...

12:58.511 --> 13:02.983
I think it's safe to say
that you are probably worth...

13:08.521 --> 13:09.756
Having a terrible father

13:09.857 --> 13:12.592
was no excuse for being one.

13:12.692 --> 13:13.626
My daughter, Angelina,

13:13.726 --> 13:16.396
was having a rough go at her mother's.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.232
And here I was, just squeezing by.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.801
And only getting 1/2 my pay

13:21.902 --> 13:25.572
meant I wasn't crawling out
of my hole any time soon.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.975
But the least it was a start.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.577
Monica.

13:30.677 --> 13:31.945
Luke.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.780
I got my rent.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.348
And what I was short last month.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.484
It looks like Luke and Monica

13:37.584 --> 13:39.152
are up to something'.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.487
What?

13:40.587 --> 13:41.747
Are you sure you can do this?

13:41.821 --> 13:45.025
Just take it while I got it.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.593
- Neighbor, hey.
- Hey Edwin.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.261
Hey, how you doing?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.362
Shut up.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.797
Yeah, is it raining today,

13:50.898 --> 13:52.732
- do you think?
- No, I'm good.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.401
It's not gonna rain to day.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.668
I'm just tired of it.

13:55.768 --> 13:56.802
What are you mumbling about?

13:56.803 --> 13:58.271
You got nothin' to say.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.639
I hope it doesn't rain.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.139
I hope it doesn't rain, too, buddy.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.542
Get a drink.

14:02.642 --> 14:06.046
- You old cow.
- You worthless piece of shit.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.515
The mountains are out.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.750
Yeah, they certainly are.

14:15.755 --> 14:19.292
I guess the dream was
to land one big case.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.429
Earn enough to move to
a better section of town.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.364
Work for a bigger player.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.698
Like Mr. Lamont.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.902
He ran this city.

14:29.002 --> 14:32.039
A job from him could
change a man's destiny.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.641
Whereas a call from Fairweather

14:34.741 --> 14:37.044
tended to be more trouble
than it was worth.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.648
Hello?

14:41.748 --> 14:43.183
Mr. Harding.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.617
Jules Fairweather here.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.518
What now?

14:45.618 --> 14:47.854
Don't be like that.

14:47.955 --> 14:51.591
I was actually just calling
to apologize.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.325
I sometimes let my emotions
get ahead of me.

14:53.326 --> 14:57.197
I get so used to dealing with
dip-shits all day, you know.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.765
You know how it is.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.435
Anyway, it looks like
you're right on point

15:02.535 --> 15:03.971
with this Gary Huang kid.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.173
So, my partners and I
have a little test.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.541
Our friend Gary Huang
has passed this test,

15:08.641 --> 15:12.145
so now we need to
deliver to him his prize.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.381
What kind of prize?

15:14.481 --> 15:16.950
Well, that's the $10,000
question, isn't it?

15:17.050 --> 15:17.817
What do you mean?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.386
I give you 10 grand
to deliver this package,

15:20.387 --> 15:22.489
and you never ask that question again.

15:22.589 --> 15:23.690
That's a lot of money.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.257
This isn't some kind of hit or anything?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.459
A hit?

15:29.462 --> 15:32.165
You think if I'm gonna
commit a homicide,

15:32.265 --> 15:33.033
my first instinct

15:34.101 --> 15:36.236
is to call up some trailer park
garbage for fuck's,

15:37.170 --> 15:39.006
fuckin' Christ.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.340
I'm just really sorry.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.174
I

15:43.443 --> 15:47.314
must be off my meds.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.649
Thank you for your patience.

15:53.286 --> 15:57.724
I have a simple, but very
important thing I ask.

15:57.824 --> 16:01.494
Deliver a package to Gary Huang, and I,

16:01.594 --> 16:03.163
I can't stress this enough,

16:03.263 --> 16:06.433
Gary himself has to be
the who opens it now.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.836
You've tailed this guy for a month, so,

16:09.936 --> 16:11.671
you know his schedule.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.145
Simple delivery job.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.282
I'll be there in an hour.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.253
What a fuckin' idiot.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.765
Luke.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.938
So, now's the time?

16:47.207 --> 16:48.075
Yeah.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.942
Doctor Who is on in a couple of hours,

16:50.043 --> 16:53.346
and Gary always watches it alone.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.181
Hmm.

16:55.782 --> 16:56.949
Then go to it.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.790
My associates will accompany you.

17:05.224 --> 17:06.358
Well, I don't really need 'em.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.160
Oh relax.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.097
They're on your side now.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.598
Gentle as kittens.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.532
Meow.

17:19.038 --> 17:23.310
I guess this Gary Huang is
a pretty lucky guy, right?

17:23.410 --> 17:24.810
Don't fish, Luke.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.579
It's very unbecoming.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.248
Gimme your piece.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.183
Who the fuck is this?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.919
Got no idea.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.386
But you know this is the first time

17:34.387 --> 17:36.589
that someone's actually passed the test.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.825
What the hell are you talking about?

17:38.925 --> 17:40.685
Scotty, you gotta pay
more fuckin' attention.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.130
Forgive me if I'm too busy main-eventing

17:43.230 --> 17:44.964
and getting laid...
Oh God.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.999
...to worry about your extra hired goon.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.401
You make it sound so fucking dirty.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.806
You fuckin' thing.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.042
What the fuck does he want?

17:56.143 --> 17:56.876
He fuckin' shot me.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.311
Turn it.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.514
Oh fuck.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.417
Hustle, he's...

18:04.517 --> 18:05.717
Scotty, I'm fucking dying, man.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.318
I fucking need you to do something or...

18:07.354 --> 18:08.955
You want it in the temple?

18:09.055 --> 18:10.790
Or I need to go to
the hospital, you fuck.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.025
Fuck this.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.694
Scotty.

18:14.794 --> 18:17.530
Fuck, Scotty.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.398
Unlock the door.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.099
- Scotty.
- Open the door.

18:20.200 --> 18:20.933
Let's go.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.068
You, get the fuck out.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.105
Hurry up.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.073
Face the door.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.409
Face the door, you fuckin' prick.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.344
If they don't come in shooting.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.180
I'm calling Fairweather.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.223
That was stupid.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.659
You really wanna do this, Luke?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.898
You really wanna take on the champ?

18:51.998 --> 18:52.732
Huh?

19:02.108 --> 19:05.178
That's why you can never
play heal, brother.

19:05.278 --> 19:05.978
Yeah?

19:07.214 --> 19:07.947
Oh shit.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.425
Luke.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.327
God damn karma.

19:21.928 --> 19:22.829
Truce?

19:22.929 --> 19:23.663
All right.

19:29.836 --> 19:30.670
Scotty.

19:34.974 --> 19:35.708
Whoa.

19:35.808 --> 19:36.642
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.377
It's all good.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.978
I don't want any trouble.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.145
This is what you want, right?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.856
Shit.

19:49.956 --> 19:50.723
Oh.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.259
Oh, where you going?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.326
I'm not done.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.928
I'm not done.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.115
You get the fuck outta here.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.500
Was it Lamont?

20:33.600 --> 20:34.567
Huh?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.403
Did Lamont send you?

20:37.770 --> 20:38.505
Huh?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.407
Oh fuck!

20:40.507 --> 20:41.240
Ow, shit.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.082
Scotty.

20:55.154 --> 20:55.888
Oh fuck.

20:55.988 --> 20:56.828
Who the fuck are you?

20:56.889 --> 20:58.925
- Fuck you, you...
- Shh.

20:59.025 --> 20:59.759
Fuck.

21:00.993 --> 21:01.728
What do you need, what do you need?

21:01.828 --> 21:04.597
My glasses, my glasses.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.065
No, no, no, no, no, you.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.133
You put them on.

21:07.233 --> 21:09.702
Look at me, look at me.

21:09.802 --> 21:10.970
I look good, right?

21:11.070 --> 21:11.903
- You look great, Scotty.
- Oh yeah,

21:11.904 --> 21:13.540
I'll leave a good-looking corpse.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.508
Ow.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.015
Whatever was in that package

21:56.115 --> 21:58.651
had somehow saved my life.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.754
Maybe deep down I felt
a connection with it.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.823
Like I owed it something.

22:08.561 --> 22:12.131
But the truth is, I killed
one of Lamont's men.

22:12.231 --> 22:16.769
Not exactly the introduction
I was looking for.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.938
If he was somehow involved,

22:19.038 --> 22:21.908
then I needed to get rid of
that package immediately.

22:23.309 --> 22:25.712
But I was still chasing money.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.990
I can feel you reading this as I write.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.592
The creature draws near.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.193
I can't help you survive.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.773
But if you want me to free your soul,

23:15.828 --> 23:17.296
you need only to stand up.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.130
Otherwise,

23:19.131 --> 23:22.034
Please remain seated
while reading this book.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.556
Where are my keys.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.325
God damnit, where are my keys?

24:01.407 --> 24:02.642
Hello?

24:02.742 --> 24:04.010
I don't like getting shot at.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.646
But lucky for you,
I still got your package.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.848
You want it back?

24:08.948 --> 24:09.916
Well, yeah.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.417
Here's the deal.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.486
You pay me what you
promised for the delivery,

24:13.586 --> 24:15.054
I bring you the package back.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.990
We can call it danger pay for
keeping your merchandise safe.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.358
All right.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.627
My place.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.061
Tomorrow at noon.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.429
45th and Thurlow.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.263
Unit 273.

24:25.397 --> 24:26.298
Very well.

24:36.175 --> 24:39.512
Oh Jules, what did you possibly think

24:39.612 --> 24:41.514
you could steal from me?

24:43.149 --> 24:46.218
Well, my friend, I hope you're ready.

24:56.462 --> 24:59.566
I want you to go there, tomorrow, noon.

24:59.666 --> 25:03.269
Pay whatever the price,
and bring me back my book.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.103
Okay.

25:04.937 --> 25:05.838
And bring Jacob with you.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.607
Things have been messed up
enough already.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.976
I think we should err on the side
of caution on this one.

25:10.076 --> 25:10.810
Mm-hmm.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.290
Hi honey.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.892
Hey dad.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.159
Can you hear me okay?

25:27.259 --> 25:28.360
Yeah, how are you?

25:28.460 --> 25:32.665
Look, do remember when
you said that, you know,

25:32.765 --> 25:34.445
if things ever got rough
for me or whatever

25:34.500 --> 25:38.304
that I could come stay with you
for awhile or something?

25:38.404 --> 25:40.306
Yeah, I remember that.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.341
No, no, that's fine.

25:42.441 --> 25:45.411
It won't take me long to straighten up.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.858
Luke, it's like almost 11 o'clock here.

25:58.958 --> 25:59.692
I know.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.565
Yeah, I just realized what
a terrible idea this is.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.200
Am I supposed to mace you now?

26:08.300 --> 26:09.936
I hope not.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.871
Tell me what the hell it is you want.

26:11.971 --> 26:13.339
Your cleaning services.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.573
And I can help.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.379
And I got this.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.182
I didn't have any cash left,

26:24.183 --> 26:26.485
but I do have this
fine bottle of brandy.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.154
It's worth over $90.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.658
There's still at least 50 bucks worth.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.125
You want me to help you clean

26:33.225 --> 26:36.629
that shit-hole apartment
of yours tonight?

26:38.230 --> 26:40.466
And I can pay you more later, too.

26:40.566 --> 26:41.446
Look, I'm sorry, Luke.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.704
I clean all day, and
I just really wanna...

26:44.804 --> 26:45.537
I understand.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.973
But you know, just keep that
bottle brandy, and I'll just,

26:47.974 --> 26:49.008
I'm sorry I bugged you.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.241
Why do you want that
apartment of yours cleaned

26:50.242 --> 26:51.243
by tomorrow?

26:54.346 --> 26:56.082
My daughter.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.051
- She's coming.
- Oh no.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.853
You do not lay some sob story on me.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.855
Especially about some kid.

27:02.955 --> 27:03.690
How old is she?

27:03.790 --> 27:04.523
18, just.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.490
How rough's she had it?

27:05.491 --> 27:06.225
Very rough.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.059
So there's a slim chance right now

27:08.060 --> 27:09.227
that you can make up
for a fraction of the crap

27:09.228 --> 27:10.228
that you put her through.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.163
A small chance.

27:11.263 --> 27:14.166
And you've got paper towels?

27:14.266 --> 27:15.702
Well yeah, I think I've got a...

27:15.802 --> 27:17.403
I'll be over in five.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.404
Oh my God, thank you so much.

27:18.504 --> 27:19.238
Be ready.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.072
I will.

27:28.314 --> 27:32.284
I knew this was a job for big old Bobby.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.653
Okay.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.522
I'll get started here.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.657
You get to the bathroom.

27:38.758 --> 27:42.061
And don't hesitate
to throw anything out.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.834
I'm gonna stack anything that
looks important on your table.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.268
You can go through it later.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.106
Okay.

27:55.307 --> 27:58.277
Only two more trips to the dumpster
and then we're done.

28:15.728 --> 28:16.562
It's so...

28:16.662 --> 28:17.496
Adequate?

28:24.103 --> 28:25.905
So, how long's it been?

28:29.241 --> 28:31.243
Since you've seen your daughter?

28:31.343 --> 28:32.244
Two years.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.246
Probably more.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.017
You miss her?

28:38.117 --> 28:39.351
So much.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.754
But I mean, I ain't got much.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.491
You've got a safe place to sleep.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.393
Sometimes that's enough.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.227
I guess.

28:49.428 --> 28:50.495
There was a time in my life
where I would have killed

28:50.496 --> 28:54.066
for just enough stability
to get something going.

28:58.437 --> 29:02.241
We make a pretty good team, you and me.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.911
You didn't step on my toes once.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.251
You know you're...

29:12.351 --> 29:13.685
What?

29:13.786 --> 29:14.520
Quite...

29:15.521 --> 29:16.355
What?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.426
I'm sorry, it's just...

29:20.526 --> 29:21.928
Yeah, it's okay.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.663
You looked interested.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.667
With my daughter coming here soon...

29:28.767 --> 29:30.402
It's okay.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.508
You go be good daddy now.

29:41.713 --> 29:42.614
My dad always said

29:43.615 --> 29:45.295
it's better to piss a woman
off for a night

29:45.351 --> 29:47.586
than for a lifetime.

29:47.686 --> 29:50.857
Like always, I wish
he was out of my head.

29:50.957 --> 29:55.561
The thing is, Monica was
the sharpest one in the tenement.

29:55.661 --> 29:59.731
She didn't deserve to get
caught up with someone like me.

30:21.453 --> 30:24.056
Shit.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.673
We knew from the moment
we saw its fleshy nest

30:41.773 --> 30:44.010
we must destroy it.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.812
I dragged it to the soft ground
using a whaling hook,

30:46.913 --> 30:49.415
where we buried it immediately.

30:52.418 --> 30:56.255
What a weak, miserable,
pathetic excuse for a...

31:05.197 --> 31:08.767
First entry for
a personal interest case.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.471
Attempting to assess the value
of an untitled journal.

31:12.571 --> 31:17.109
Something about an explorer
trapped in the woods.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.878
If it is a true journal,

31:19.979 --> 31:22.314
he's clearly going insane from panic.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.617
Your device storage is full.

31:25.717 --> 31:26.452
What?

31:26.552 --> 31:28.720
I should have tons.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.793
First entry for a personal
interest case.

31:34.893 --> 31:39.631
Attempting to assess the value
of an untitled journal.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.734
The text appears to be
handwritten in ink.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.071
First journal entry for Luke Harding.

31:45.171 --> 31:48.040
This is the first entry for
a personal interest case.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.140
I'm trying to figure out,

31:49.841 --> 31:50.775
assessing the value of
a book with no title

31:50.776 --> 31:52.111
that I think might be priceless.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.546
His ship landed in 1903.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.449
There were 20 in his original party.

31:57.549 --> 31:58.417
Some kind of residue,

31:58.517 --> 31:59.677
I had enough of this fuckin',

31:59.751 --> 32:01.019
what the hell was I just saying?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.454
God damnit.

32:29.415 --> 32:33.585
That thing in the bathroom
couldn't have been real.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.256
I just need some sleep.

33:43.489 --> 33:44.723
Page 18.

33:44.823 --> 33:47.559
My companions don't seem
to be showing any symptoms,

33:47.659 --> 33:50.329
but I know my mind has been poisoned.

33:50.429 --> 33:51.697
I feel my memories shattering

33:51.797 --> 33:54.066
until I can't trust my own thoughts.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.234
I can't trust anyone.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.902
I'm coming.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.347
You must be Luke Harding.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.514
You're with Fairweather?

34:09.614 --> 34:11.850
We came for the package.

34:11.949 --> 34:16.222
Excuse my eager friend,
but we are here for business.

34:16.322 --> 34:17.889
It's on the table.

34:22.328 --> 34:23.562
You don't look familiar.

34:23.661 --> 34:24.830
You do.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.898
Do you work for Fairweather much?

34:26.998 --> 34:29.301
Only once, but it's been a long job.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.141
My God.

34:35.241 --> 34:37.743
You've only had it for one day?

34:38.677 --> 34:39.878
Yeah.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.012
Wait, what?

34:41.112 --> 34:41.847
Look,

34:43.815 --> 34:45.583
I just want that thing gone.

34:45.684 --> 34:49.721
I'm afraid it's a little late for that.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.757
Thank you for your time.

34:52.991 --> 34:53.791
Where are you going?

34:53.824 --> 34:54.926
We had a deal.

34:55.025 --> 34:58.864
We came for a package,
not this coloring book.

34:58.964 --> 34:59.965
That's bullshit.

35:00.065 --> 35:01.567
Look, I just need that money.

35:01.667 --> 35:04.203
You have any problems,
take it up with Fairweather.

35:04.303 --> 35:06.872
Hey, why don't buy some sleeves.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.842
I'm really very sorry, Mr. Harding.

35:11.910 --> 35:15.981
But believe me, there's
nothing more we can do for you.

35:20.686 --> 35:21.753
God damnit.

35:25.157 --> 35:27.326
Come on, answer, you bastard.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.160
Hello.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.195
Fairweather.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.562
Yeah, this is Jules Fairweather.

35:30.596 --> 35:31.530
It's Luke Harding.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.265
Your men came, then refused the package.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.566
I see.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.835
Did you by chance open the book?

35:36.935 --> 35:38.003
Well, yeah.

35:38.103 --> 35:42.040
Ah, that would explain
things from my end.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.942
Look, I just need that money.

35:44.042 --> 35:45.611
I don't care about some stupid book.

35:45.711 --> 35:47.313
Shit, Harding.

35:47.413 --> 35:51.183
Let's just say that's about to change.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.519
I could snipe him, easy.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.421
The man's performed a miracle.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.223
And all you can think to do is kill him?

35:59.491 --> 36:00.559
Mr. Lamont.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.561
Do you have it?

36:02.661 --> 36:06.332
It's inside, but it's been compromised.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.066
Tragic, but acceptable.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.068
The guy is on page 18.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.638
Pardon?

36:12.738 --> 36:14.340
It's true, sir.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.741
Page 18.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.609
In one night?

36:17.709 --> 36:19.044
Of my own eyes.

36:19.144 --> 36:19.878
I saw it.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.483
Well, that changes everything.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.518
Just remember to remain seated.

36:26.618 --> 36:29.187
We've lost many good people
to the hooks.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.256
What hooks?

36:30.356 --> 36:31.690
Well, they come with the book.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.624
What?

36:32.724 --> 36:34.526
The rest will come from you.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.528
You just gotta get to the ending.

36:36.628 --> 36:40.232
I doubt you'll survive, but who knows.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.501
I don't want him touched.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.803
Observe and get closer.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.805
I want a full study.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.874
As much as I'd like
to break out my violin

36:48.974 --> 36:51.142
and play the sad tune you wanna hear,

36:51.243 --> 36:53.144
I'm in over my head, too.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.480
And we need to work together

36:54.580 --> 36:56.260
- to get out of it.
- We had a simple deal.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.584
I want you to come and
pick up this god damn book.

36:58.684 --> 36:59.851
No advice I give

36:59.951 --> 37:02.120
will make any sense to ya right now.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.624
We're just gonna have to
wait until you've read more.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.260
I've hacked into his phone.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.729
It's recording a conversation right now.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.163
Anything unusual.

37:12.264 --> 37:15.334
Do not send those
two monkeys over here anymore.

37:18.537 --> 37:21.607
It sounds like he's talking to flies.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.275
I imagine he does.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.244
That's what I expected.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.951
It was at that moment I decided,

37:33.051 --> 37:34.586
whether it was a possessed book,

37:34.686 --> 37:36.288
a toxic hallucinogenic,

37:36.388 --> 37:39.525
or they were testing
some elaborate con on me,

37:39.625 --> 37:42.027
I would treat this like any other case.

37:42.127 --> 37:44.863
I keep leaving notes to myself.

37:44.963 --> 37:49.000
To help with my sudden
lapses in my memory.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.837
I would use the explorer's
own words to track him

37:51.937 --> 37:53.939
and plot out his journey.

37:57.343 --> 38:01.513
The creature was so hideous,
their instinct was to bury it.

38:03.715 --> 38:05.651
Then the madness set in.

38:05.751 --> 38:09.154
Hallucinations, memory loss,
and paranoia.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.658
But the explorer only
had a feather and ink

38:13.659 --> 38:16.127
to try and document his experience.

38:16.227 --> 38:20.399
Whereas I could separate and
organize his random thoughts.

38:27.272 --> 38:29.240
I just need to keep track.

38:29.341 --> 38:31.577
I began with two companions,

38:33.412 --> 38:34.245
a lantern,

38:35.547 --> 38:36.948
a length of rope,

38:38.350 --> 38:39.351
and a knife.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.286
Maybe

38:43.589 --> 38:46.291
this substance is made
from some rare plant.

38:46.392 --> 38:48.527
I had to get to know him.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.261
How can an explorer simply bury

38:50.362 --> 38:52.398
the discovery of a lifetime?

38:52.498 --> 38:53.999
And then it hit me.

38:55.801 --> 38:57.241
The one thing the explorer was doing

38:57.302 --> 38:59.605
that was out of character.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.573
To keep such immaculate records,

39:01.673 --> 39:05.744
he had never once mentioned
this mysterious substance.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.879
What if he had brought it back.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.782
What if this isn't just
a journal of the creature?

39:10.882 --> 39:12.117
This is its tomb.

39:13.452 --> 39:15.887
That is, assuming that it's dead.

39:19.558 --> 39:22.994
In these brief flashes, somehow,

39:23.094 --> 39:25.263
it all just comes together.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.736
And I know exactly where he is.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.605
And what he needs to do.

39:34.473 --> 39:36.642
I hid your keys.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.383
And what he needs to do.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.553
I hid your keys.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.562
Hello?

39:56.662 --> 39:58.630
I hid your keys.

40:02.701 --> 40:03.502
Daddy.

40:06.772 --> 40:07.806
Daddy!

40:31.429 --> 40:33.031
Jesus.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.132
Sorry.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.501
Hi.

40:35.601 --> 40:36.602
Come on in.

40:36.702 --> 40:39.104
Okay, sorry.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.092
So, how was the bus?

41:03.128 --> 41:04.029
Yeah, um.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.498
Sorry I was late.

41:06.598 --> 41:07.666
That's okay.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.218
I'll give you as much space as I can.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.555
You come and go as you like.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.359
And you're really on route
to someplace else,

41:34.459 --> 41:36.161
and you just stopped by to sting me,

41:36.261 --> 41:38.830
there's a firebox wedged
behind the bookcase there.

41:38.930 --> 41:42.568
What little stuff of value
I've got is in it.

41:43.535 --> 41:46.237
I'm not saying that I think
that's what you came for,

41:46.337 --> 41:48.339
just that I'd understand.

41:49.941 --> 41:54.546
And I wouldn't recommend
bringing any guys home.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.649
Sorry, but that's the best I can offer.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.751
That's okay.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.054
How's the couch?

42:03.154 --> 42:05.423
Yeah, it's comfy, I guess.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.293
I'm gonna go take a nap.

42:08.393 --> 42:09.127
Yep.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.093
Hello?

42:42.193 --> 42:43.061
Luke.

42:43.161 --> 42:44.763
How's the apartment holding up?

42:44.863 --> 42:45.664
It's doing great.

42:45.764 --> 42:46.732
Great.

42:46.832 --> 42:47.633
Um, listen.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.136
I've been getting a lot of calls lately.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.270
What kind of calls?

42:52.370 --> 42:53.438
Mrs. Oats.

42:53.538 --> 42:55.273
She's always seeing things around here.

42:55.373 --> 42:56.775
And I figured,

42:56.875 --> 42:58.743
since we have a private
detective in the building,

42:58.744 --> 42:59.977
I might as well give him a call

42:59.978 --> 43:01.279
and ask him if he wants to...

43:01.379 --> 43:02.480
I hear something.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.660
You're cooking, aren't you?

43:03.749 --> 43:05.383
Yeah, just lunch.

43:05.483 --> 43:07.619
Same plans for dinner?

43:07.719 --> 43:09.621
Is this an invitation?

43:10.689 --> 43:12.123
My place?

43:12.223 --> 43:12.958
Yeah.

43:37.348 --> 43:38.183
Yeah?

43:38.283 --> 43:39.584
You're still alive.

43:39.685 --> 43:41.720
Damn good thing
there's no gambling in hell

43:41.820 --> 43:45.356
or I'd be a poor man right now.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.993
I don't know what you're on about.

43:49.127 --> 43:50.161
Lamont must be pissed

43:50.261 --> 43:52.230
- a moron like you comes along...
- Look...

43:52.330 --> 43:53.965
And passes page 40.

43:54.065 --> 43:57.769
Then why don't you give my five grand.

43:57.869 --> 43:58.904
And I'll take it today.

43:59.004 --> 44:00.872
You won't be going anywhere.

44:00.972 --> 44:03.574
You probably already tried
to leave a dozen times.

44:03.675 --> 44:05.176
Walked around in some daze,

44:05.276 --> 44:07.913
only to end up back
in front of the book.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.147
It doesn't work.

44:09.247 --> 44:12.718
And it only wears ya out quicker.

44:12.818 --> 44:13.919
I keep seeing things.

44:14.019 --> 44:17.155
Ah, most of it's just in your head now.

44:17.255 --> 44:19.925
You just need to get to
the end of the story.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.426
What's so special about the ending?

44:21.526 --> 44:23.494
That's what I wanted to find out.

44:23.594 --> 44:26.832
I stole the book to harness its power.

44:26.932 --> 44:27.665
Just remember,

44:28.834 --> 44:30.500
all this shit started the moment
you opened that book.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.771
And it'll finish when
you're done reading it.

44:32.871 --> 44:34.505
Just read the book.

44:45.083 --> 44:49.187
The voice spoke as if
it were my own thoughts,

44:49.287 --> 44:51.689
constantly trying to trick me.

44:54.893 --> 44:55.727
Okay.

45:00.331 --> 45:03.168
You miserable little pencil-pecker.

45:03.268 --> 45:05.003
Fuck you, dad.

45:05.103 --> 45:07.705
Did you just tell
your father to fuck off?

45:07.806 --> 45:09.808
And who the hell is this?

45:19.184 --> 45:20.185
So, today,

45:21.219 --> 45:23.388
I can go to Julie's place.

45:25.190 --> 45:26.256
She's this girl I met on the bus.

45:26.257 --> 45:27.592
And she said she's gonna help me

45:27.692 --> 45:30.628
with my resume and stuff, so.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.163
Yeah, great.

45:32.263 --> 45:32.998
Yeah.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.067
Are there any openings at your office?

45:36.167 --> 45:37.836
- No.
- Maybe?

45:37.936 --> 45:39.905
Nothing, like in the mail room or...

45:40.005 --> 45:40.972
No, no, no, no.

45:41.072 --> 45:43.474
I mean, I'm not an accountant.

45:46.211 --> 45:47.045
Oh.

45:49.614 --> 45:51.249
Okay, so what do you do then?

45:51.349 --> 45:54.786
Uh, surveillance, security.

45:54.886 --> 45:57.655
What, like a private eye?

45:57.755 --> 45:58.588
Why wouldn't you you tell me

45:58.589 --> 45:59.656
you were a private investigator?

45:59.657 --> 46:01.559
It's, like, badass.

46:01.659 --> 46:04.062
Just wanted to set a good example.

46:04.162 --> 46:07.398
By pretending to be an accountant?

46:07.498 --> 46:09.935
Here, I'll take it out for you, I'm out.

46:10.035 --> 46:14.005
Don't you have to finish
getting dressed first?

46:15.106 --> 46:17.242
I am finished.

46:17.342 --> 46:18.476
Ain't that a bra?

46:18.576 --> 46:20.211
Well, like,

46:20.311 --> 46:23.348
it acts like one, but it's like a shirt.

46:23.448 --> 46:24.282
Too, kinda.

46:26.084 --> 46:27.218
Can you zip it up,

46:27.318 --> 46:31.456
and just pretend that's
how you're gonna look today?

46:31.556 --> 46:32.290
Yeah.

46:32.390 --> 46:33.124
Fine.

46:43.001 --> 46:43.835
Oh, um,

46:44.669 --> 46:45.503
thanks.

46:46.537 --> 46:48.539
You know, for the couch.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.244
No worries.

46:53.344 --> 46:54.079
Okay.

46:54.179 --> 46:54.913
See ya.

47:04.055 --> 47:04.890
Sorry.

47:08.759 --> 47:10.061
Fuck, man.

47:10.161 --> 47:12.463
This job usually has caviar and shit.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.432
Why the hell are we
bothering with this nobody?

47:14.532 --> 47:17.168
Because he's got
street smarts, like you.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.104
Yeah, you're right.

47:19.204 --> 47:20.604
All this time they've been
dicking around

47:20.605 --> 47:22.607
with these Harvard grad types like you.

47:26.111 --> 47:26.844
Oh, hold on.

47:27.913 --> 47:29.915
But it takes a man like me
to get the job done.

47:40.591 --> 47:41.326
Help.

47:44.963 --> 47:45.964
It's true.

47:48.199 --> 47:49.034
Help.

47:50.035 --> 47:52.037
All this time Lamont's
been trying to lure it

47:52.137 --> 47:54.239
like it's some kind of princess.

47:54.339 --> 47:56.274
And the fact is, Help me.

47:56.374 --> 47:59.610
It's nothing but a soulless, primitive

48:00.711 --> 48:01.546
monster.

48:04.382 --> 48:05.516
Exactly.

48:06.751 --> 48:09.687
See, if it were me, I would
just pretend to read the thing.

48:10.755 --> 48:12.290
How 'bout that.

48:12.390 --> 48:14.292
Two minutes on the job,

48:14.392 --> 48:16.928
and you've already solved
the whole thing.

48:17.028 --> 48:18.829
Oh, one more thing.

48:18.930 --> 48:20.731
As a piece of advice.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.900
Shit goes down, walk away.

48:24.769 --> 48:25.836
Safety first.

48:27.772 --> 48:31.542
You're gonna be around
a long time, Boston.

48:40.085 --> 48:41.919
Oh for fuck's sakes.

48:46.424 --> 48:48.293
About this equipment.

48:48.393 --> 48:51.629
Did you have family in the Cold War?

48:51.729 --> 48:52.597
What?

48:52.697 --> 48:54.499
Exactly what I thought.

49:02.473 --> 49:03.208
Jesus.

49:04.809 --> 49:07.045
God damnit, am I thirsty.

49:23.528 --> 49:26.197
Nice camera placement, Boston.

49:42.513 --> 49:46.851
Note to self, I already have water.

49:46.951 --> 49:51.022
Okay, this place gets
a C plus for sandwich fixing.

49:54.292 --> 49:55.960
Fuck, I'm thirsty.

49:58.596 --> 49:59.364
Find me.

50:01.866 --> 50:02.867
Something's happening.

50:02.967 --> 50:06.204
Fuck

50:11.042 --> 50:13.278
That was, uh, fascinating.

50:35.133 --> 50:37.868
I have a rope, a lantern, and a knife.

50:56.754 --> 50:57.488
What?

50:57.588 --> 50:58.656
No mustard?

50:58.756 --> 51:00.425
This place is spooky.

51:12.337 --> 51:14.605
This is all in your head.

51:18.876 --> 51:19.710
Fuck.

51:29.987 --> 51:33.724
Hey, dad, remember
when I told you about Julie?

51:33.824 --> 51:35.926
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Harding.

51:36.026 --> 51:37.962
Yeah, you too.

51:38.062 --> 51:39.196
We were just gonna watch a movie.

51:39.197 --> 51:41.266
So, I didn't think you'd mind.

51:41.366 --> 51:42.367
Yeah, okay.

51:43.301 --> 51:46.404
Well, you two have a good time.

51:46.504 --> 51:47.505
Dad?

51:47.605 --> 51:48.439
Yeah?

51:48.539 --> 51:50.841
Julie is my special friend.

51:56.947 --> 51:59.350
Well, that I didn't know.

51:59.450 --> 52:00.885
You and me are gonna have a talk.

52:00.985 --> 52:01.985
If you have a problem with this,

52:01.986 --> 52:03.086
- I can just go.
- Hey, my daughter's sexuality

52:03.087 --> 52:04.622
is none of my business.

52:04.722 --> 52:07.692
But if you wanna sit
that close to her, it is.

52:07.792 --> 52:11.095
Now, my daughter is
a very special person

52:11.196 --> 52:13.864
with a lot of dreams and ambitions.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.165
And I don't want her
hooking up with some...

52:15.166 --> 52:16.234
Dad!

52:16.334 --> 52:20.004
Person with one thing on their mind.

52:20.104 --> 52:22.039
So what are your intentions?

52:22.139 --> 52:23.641
Um.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.243
Noble.

52:25.343 --> 52:27.111
We're just getting to know each other.

52:27.212 --> 52:29.280
Seeing if we click or not.

52:30.681 --> 52:32.649
Well, I don't think you have
to sit that close to do that,

52:32.650 --> 52:33.651
but so be it.

52:35.186 --> 52:37.188
You're outta here by 11:30.

52:37.288 --> 52:38.088
Yes, sir.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.792
Okay, enjoy the movie.

52:41.892 --> 52:42.627
Thanks.

52:43.628 --> 52:44.929
I'm so sorry.

52:45.029 --> 52:46.096
Oh my God.

52:46.197 --> 52:47.798
That was so cute.

52:47.898 --> 52:49.800
That was not cute.

52:49.900 --> 52:51.902
That was so embarrassing.

52:52.002 --> 52:52.737
Don't be.

52:52.837 --> 52:53.571
Hey.

52:54.772 --> 52:59.109
He puts you on that same
pedestal that I want to.

53:17.295 --> 53:19.830
Where was I?

53:19.930 --> 53:22.900
I could feel exposure to the book
boring holes in my memory

53:23.000 --> 53:25.069
as it assaulted me with my past.

53:25.169 --> 53:28.205
God damnit, where are my keys?

53:28.306 --> 53:31.175
So you might wanna wear
gloves when you read it.

53:31.276 --> 53:33.844
As for me, it was a little late.

53:34.812 --> 53:37.948
So I decided to meet this thing head-on.

53:46.724 --> 53:51.296
Just as your notes
predict, here you are.

53:51.396 --> 53:54.064
Welcome to the future, Mr. Harding.

53:56.534 --> 53:58.102
Dad, are you home?

54:03.674 --> 54:05.175
I need the shower.

54:26.431 --> 54:27.264
Hello?

54:31.669 --> 54:33.571
Is someone there?

54:35.740 --> 54:37.908
- Dad, is that you?
- Where are my fuckin' keys?

54:55.025 --> 54:57.027
Stay calm, Mr. Harding.

54:57.127 --> 54:59.296
You're experiencing
a vision from the book.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.130
Do I know you?

55:00.230 --> 55:01.899
No.

55:01.999 --> 55:04.201
But I feel like I know you.

55:04.301 --> 55:07.438
And thanks to your notes,
I've captured this.

55:07.538 --> 55:08.473
What is it?

55:09.540 --> 55:11.809
It spawned themoment I reached page 18.

55:11.909 --> 55:15.279
And you've already warned me
what's coming next.

55:15.380 --> 55:17.582
I've been following your story.

55:17.682 --> 55:18.949
Quietly.

55:19.049 --> 55:21.018
On the shadows.

55:21.118 --> 55:22.987
You have an advantage.

55:23.087 --> 55:25.055
I believe the book
chooses those it wants

55:25.155 --> 55:27.458
to include in its pages.

55:27.558 --> 55:28.459
It chose you.

55:28.559 --> 55:30.027
How can I stop it?

55:30.127 --> 55:32.530
Depends if we can trust each other.

55:32.630 --> 55:35.833
How do I know you're not
a manifestation of the book?

55:35.933 --> 55:37.835
Trying to manipulate me.

55:38.669 --> 55:41.706
You see, I already know your story.

55:41.806 --> 55:42.773
Tell me mine.

55:47.277 --> 55:48.979
What's wrong with your face?

55:49.079 --> 55:50.948
It's okay, Luke.

55:51.916 --> 55:53.618
You're not even here.

55:53.718 --> 55:57.655
Yeah, so that's pretty much
everything, you know,

55:57.755 --> 56:01.826
about me, that I've got
for first date confessions.

56:03.494 --> 56:04.662
You all right?

56:05.530 --> 56:06.363
Yeah.

56:07.532 --> 56:09.700
How's it going?

56:11.201 --> 56:13.303
Are we going to the gym?

56:13.404 --> 56:15.039
They have one here?

56:17.107 --> 56:19.176
Thanks for coming over.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.112
Thanks for the dinner.

56:22.212 --> 56:23.213
And the wine.

56:24.515 --> 56:26.250
He's a good listener.

56:26.350 --> 56:29.754
Luke, I had a lot of fun
tonight and, um,

56:29.854 --> 56:31.889
I look forward to date number two.

56:31.989 --> 56:32.723
Me too.

56:34.859 --> 56:37.294
There's something
too innocent about him.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.829
Look at her face.

56:38.929 --> 56:40.931
She's already worried about hurting him.

56:41.031 --> 56:41.932
Of course.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.069
Anyway, that was nice.

56:46.170 --> 56:47.772
- Yeah.
- Goodnight.

56:49.073 --> 56:50.074
Goodnight.

56:51.175 --> 56:52.610
No chance.

56:56.313 --> 56:57.915
Hey dad.

56:58.015 --> 56:59.884
Is your date over already?

56:59.984 --> 57:01.719
It wasn't much of a date.

57:01.819 --> 57:02.553
Hey dad.

57:04.489 --> 57:08.392
I didn't have much of a date either.

57:08.493 --> 57:09.794
Why?

57:09.894 --> 57:11.529
Did she do something?

57:13.397 --> 57:14.665
No.

57:14.765 --> 57:16.000
I did something.

57:20.004 --> 57:21.538
You know, you might
find this hard to believe,

57:21.539 --> 57:23.674
but I'm actually the one

57:23.774 --> 57:27.512
that the parents warn their kids about.

57:27.612 --> 57:28.692
Julie would never admit it,

57:29.714 --> 57:32.650
but I know she's only
going out with me out of pity.

57:32.750 --> 57:34.350
She's only gonna feel that way about you

57:34.418 --> 57:36.587
if you keep telling her to.

57:38.288 --> 57:40.691
Are you giving me advice?

57:40.791 --> 57:44.662
You may not think that I know much
about relationships,

57:44.762 --> 57:46.731
but I can get ya started.

57:48.298 --> 57:51.836
I don't know, like, I just,

57:51.936 --> 57:54.505
like, I don't know
what to say or what to do.

57:54.605 --> 57:57.675
She's so confusing.

57:57.775 --> 57:59.243
Is there music on this thing?

57:59.343 --> 58:00.077
Yeah.

58:00.177 --> 58:01.646
All right.

58:02.613 --> 58:06.316
Boston, why don't you hit the sheets.

58:06.416 --> 58:08.452
I'll take the first shift.

58:08.553 --> 58:10.020
What?

58:10.120 --> 58:12.757
The most important thing that
you need to know about women

58:12.857 --> 58:14.592
is that they love to dance.

58:16.260 --> 58:18.328
No, I don't dance.

58:18.428 --> 58:19.496
Prove it.

58:19.597 --> 58:20.497
Dad, seriously?

58:21.766 --> 58:23.466
Well yeah, I mean, we're the only
two people in this room.

58:23.467 --> 58:24.368
I can't believe you.

58:24.468 --> 58:25.936
Come on.

58:26.036 --> 58:26.771
You ready?

58:29.173 --> 58:30.340
I don't know what to do.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.377
I wish my dad would dance like that.

58:33.477 --> 58:35.546
Please go to sleep.

58:35.646 --> 58:37.314
Now, you take Julie dancing.

58:37.414 --> 58:41.018
And you're gonna prove to her
that you know how to have fun.

58:41.118 --> 58:42.152
Yeah, there we go.

58:46.390 --> 58:47.925
Just grab the bottle of wine.

58:48.025 --> 58:49.727
That's what you always end up picking.

58:49.827 --> 58:51.528
I ain't thirsty.

58:51.629 --> 58:52.429
It's just that,

58:54.064 --> 58:55.532
can't you hear that?

58:55.633 --> 58:56.701
Hear what?

58:58.468 --> 58:59.770
Scratching.

58:59.870 --> 59:02.807
Please, I don't hear nothin' but you.

59:02.907 --> 59:04.341
Bitching about nothing.

59:04.441 --> 59:06.210
I'm calling Monica.

59:06.310 --> 59:09.013
Will you leave her alone.

59:09.113 --> 59:10.214
We ain't got rats.

59:10.314 --> 59:11.882
We ain't got raccoons.

59:11.982 --> 59:13.918
There's only one thing
I get around here.

59:14.018 --> 59:14.819
Yeah, what's that?

59:16.887 --> 59:19.356
Irritated by the fucking
worthless sound of your voice.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.141
Yeah?

59:37.241 --> 59:38.776
Damnit, Luke, I gotta say,

59:38.876 --> 59:40.711
I thought you were a gonner.

59:40.811 --> 59:42.546
I even let myself rot.

59:42.647 --> 59:44.715
Can you gimme something?

59:46.183 --> 59:48.385
What do you already know about the book?

59:48.485 --> 59:49.820
I'll tell you one thing,

59:49.920 --> 59:53.223
you get to the end, you'll be
the safest man on the planet.

59:53.323 --> 59:54.659
Lamont will keep you protected

59:54.759 --> 59:57.394
for that piece of information.

59:57.494 --> 01:00:01.298
He's the only guy to survive
an encounter with the book.

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:04.334
But we ain't exactly on
speaking terms anymore.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.037
And although I was grateful

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.639
to have two companions,

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:10.039
I just couldn't shake the feeling

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.476
that I'd begun this journey alone.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:17.147
Dad!

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:18.348
Jesus.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.284
Did you not hear me calling you?

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:23.287
Oh my God, you get so spaced out
when you read that,

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:24.121
what?

01:00:24.221 --> 01:00:25.890
Listen, you need to promise me

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:27.424
you're not gonna read this thing.

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:28.859
Dad, you literally,

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.728
you give me this speech
every 20 minutes.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:33.731
I don't wanna read your stupid book.

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:39.469
I was just trying to show you
my new outfit, that's all.

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.808
Well, you look beautiful.

01:00:43.908 --> 01:00:44.641
Thanks.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:46.910
Okay, well, you need to shower,

01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.246
because Julie's gonna
be here at 6:00, so.

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:50.080
Me?

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:52.782
Yeah, you've been festering
in that bedroom for too long.

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:53.617
You stink.

01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:54.638
I need you to make sure

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:56.252
that you stay away from that thing.

01:00:56.253 --> 01:00:57.754
Dad, I don't wanna
read your stupid book.

01:00:57.755 --> 01:00:58.889
Are serious?

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.025
Okay, I've gotta clean up out here.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.192
Can you just hurry up?

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:03.027
Fine.

01:01:58.582 --> 01:01:59.817
Hello?

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:04.221
Hello?

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:12.562
What the hell?

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:37.454
See, I didn't kill my husband.

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:40.224
He turned into my uncle.

01:02:40.324 --> 01:02:43.693
I mean, he literally
turned into my uncle.

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:47.297
And my uncle's already dead.

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:52.202
Whatever you say, Mrs. Oats.

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:54.771
Ms. Oates, if you don't mind.

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:02.847
Good evening, Mr. Harding.

01:03:02.947 --> 01:03:03.680
Gifts.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:05.215
The roses are for Angelina,

01:03:05.315 --> 01:03:07.151
but the chocolates are for you.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:08.452
You are so sweet.

01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:09.286
Thank you.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:11.521
Buttering up the old man.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.622
What'd you get, dad?

01:03:14.424 --> 01:03:15.725
Uh, chocolates.

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:17.594
Can I have one?

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:18.929
Yeah.

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:20.330
Thanks.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:21.631
You drive here?

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:23.167
No, I took a cab.

01:03:23.267 --> 01:03:25.369
Good, I'll even pay
for the cab fare home.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:26.203
- Oh no.
- No.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.136
- No, no.
- Dad, it's fine.

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:27.872
It's okay.

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:29.006
It's okay.

01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:35.012
Well, just promise me
you'll go easy on the drinks.

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:37.281
We'll be too busy dancing,
don't worry about it.

01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:38.115
Good.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.086
Care for a chocolate?

01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:42.920
Sure.

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:44.855
Thanks.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:45.689
Bye, dad.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:46.523
Bye.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.254
I hid your keys,

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:19.890
and you haven't even
tried to find them yet.

01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:21.325
I can't play with you.

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:26.230
At least page 70, not that
I was looking too close.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:27.231
I'm sorry.

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:30.834
Maybe whatever you are was somehow real.

01:04:30.935 --> 01:04:33.737
But you are not my daughter.

01:04:33.837 --> 01:04:35.105
I'm real, I'm...

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:36.206
Relax.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.109
That's why you bring me in.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.211
I'm always one step ahead.

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:54.791
Who the hell am I talking to?

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:25.089
God, no.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:26.756
No!

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:27.724
Angelina, no!

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:35.165
This isn't just your story anymore.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.835
And she's such a bad girl.

01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:43.073
I blame her parents.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:49.379
Sir.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:50.879
We've finally reestablished
communication

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.182
with Jacob and Boston.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.383
Good.

01:05:53.483 --> 01:05:55.952
They're acting very peculiar.

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:57.854
Really?

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:00.157
Put them on.

01:06:06.563 --> 01:06:07.297
Oh my God.

01:06:18.775 --> 01:06:20.110
Hey, you okay?

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:23.347
I'm getting kinda hot.

01:06:23.447 --> 01:06:25.582
Okay, let's take a break.

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.186
Hello, sir.

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:30.820
Hello, gentlemen.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.689
How is everything?

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:36.226
He's been very active on the book.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.162
Oh, I have something to report.

01:06:38.262 --> 01:06:41.031
On Dave the jack-off
standing right next to you.

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:42.199
Pardon?

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:44.301
He kept telling us
there's a third person

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:45.735
in the room with us.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.171
I see.

01:06:47.271 --> 01:06:48.772
That shit ain't funny, Dave.

01:06:55.312 --> 01:06:56.380
Do you want a beer?

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.182
No, no, I'll have one in a little bit.

01:06:58.282 --> 01:06:59.015
Thanks.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:04.288
You have such beautiful eyes.

01:07:04.388 --> 01:07:08.858
We would appreciate
a certain professionalism.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.494
Of course.

01:07:10.594 --> 01:07:11.595
Dave.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:15.632
Apologize for your poor sense of humor.

01:07:15.732 --> 01:07:16.966
I'm sorry.

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:19.936
Do you think we're a fun couple?

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.938
I'm having a fun time.

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:23.840
Me too.

01:07:41.258 --> 01:07:43.360
Wait, I love this song.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.529
We so have to dance again.

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.835
Thank you, sir.

01:07:51.935 --> 01:07:55.805
Things are just getting
a little tense around here.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.208
Well, I'm glad everything's on track.

01:07:58.308 --> 01:08:00.610
I look forward to your next updates.

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:06.716
It's happening.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:14.863
Jacob, you gotta try this.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.093
It's all like 3D and stuff.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.662
Oh whoa.

01:08:19.763 --> 01:08:22.399
I find it disorientating.

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:24.968
Oh, it's so cool, though.

01:08:25.068 --> 01:08:28.471
Oh wow, it's so,

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:30.374
wow.

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.216
You had a point.

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:40.283
Safety first.

01:08:58.902 --> 01:09:02.872
Mr. Lamont, if you are
able to hear this message,

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.911
I wanted you to know, I quit.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:16.453
Vacate.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:17.487
Now.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:18.322
Get out.

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:19.221
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

01:09:19.256 --> 01:09:20.490
Fuck.

01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:22.192
Thank you.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:23.527
- Fuck you, bitch.
- Driver.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:24.761
Get me to the airport Jerk.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:26.830
- Now.
- Prick, man.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.163
Tango?

01:09:28.265 --> 01:09:29.533
You've got it, girl.

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:41.211
I'll give you a big dip, you ready?

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:42.446
Yes.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.340
Say goodnight to your dad for me?

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.174
Yeah.

01:10:18.482 --> 01:10:19.783
Hey dad.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.785
Find the keys.

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:29.593
Hi.

01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:30.994
Hello, dear.

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:32.296
Is everything okay?

01:10:32.396 --> 01:10:33.730
Oh, why yes.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.132
We're just about to have tea.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.635
Why don't you join us?

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:39.469
Dad?

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:44.608
Fuckin' keys.

01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:46.843
You didn't ask where my date went.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:55.685
Did you really think I would stay

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.687
because you hid my keys?

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:01.791
I'd have torn my arms off

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:04.728
to get away from you and your mother.

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:06.896
You're one that I hated.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:08.832
Have you found my keys?

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:14.237
I look at you.

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.442
And I hate myself.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:22.412
For creating something

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:23.480
so worthless!

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:32.556
Where are my fucking keys?

01:11:35.525 --> 01:11:37.994
So, we're just gonna sit here

01:11:39.663 --> 01:11:41.931
and have a nice cup of tea.

01:11:48.104 --> 01:11:50.574
I know who you think we are,
but we are not demons.

01:11:50.674 --> 01:11:52.008
You are demons.

01:11:53.577 --> 01:11:57.414
Oh, you may not know it yet,
but it'll happen.

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:01.150
Oh dear.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.586
It's not loaded!

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.392
Hey Jules, I need you to call me back.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:11.361
Look, I think when we were at the club

01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.430
someone slipped me something.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:33.883
It's not until I reached

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:35.519
the last few pages of this journal

01:12:35.619 --> 01:12:37.587
I know what I need to do.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.530
I must stop this story.

01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:01.110
Or will the creature find
another way to preserve itself?

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:05.014
He killed them.

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.383
He killed all of them.

01:13:07.484 --> 01:13:09.819
Was that really his solution?

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:12.556
Was it supposed to be mine?

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:18.528
Luke, you're so close.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:20.430
Just one last demon to kill.

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:21.898
Angelina.

01:13:21.998 --> 01:13:23.366
She's in the closet.

01:13:23.467 --> 01:13:25.835
So finish the book, please.

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:29.473
My time is up, I've just gotta know now.

01:13:29.573 --> 01:13:31.541
What a god damn mess.

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:33.542
Didn't even let the poor bastard
hang up the phone.

01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:34.611
Fairweather!

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:42.686
The explorer's ending wasn't enough.

01:13:42.786 --> 01:13:45.321
The creature wanted me to kill.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:49.325
But violence hadn't exactly
worked out for the explorer.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:50.660
How do I reason with something

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.897
that really thinks it's my baby girl?

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:54.897
I'd have to face something

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:57.200
I'd intended to take to the grave.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.802
When I was a kid,

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:01.170
I went and I...

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.439
Hid my keys.

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:05.742
Yeah.

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:20.757
You can't find them!

01:14:20.857 --> 01:14:21.858
You have to see me!

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.027
You are not my daughter!

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.197
I was playing.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.866
And I hid your keys.

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:32.736
I guess, I don't know,

01:14:32.836 --> 01:14:35.138
I thought it would be funny
or something.

01:14:35.238 --> 01:14:37.707
But then you started to get mad.

01:14:39.543 --> 01:14:41.878
And you started to get upset.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:46.182
And then you just, you left.

01:14:47.717 --> 01:14:49.252
I'm sorry, kid.

01:14:49.352 --> 01:14:51.655
Your father died in prison
when you were two.

01:14:51.755 --> 01:14:54.090
Figures.

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:56.225
It was your fault.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:59.395
I just couldn't take
living with you anymore.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.097
Why wouldn't mom say anything?

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:03.099
I told your mother not to tell you.

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:03.933
Yeah, is that why?

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:06.202
You just couldn't stand me?

01:15:07.737 --> 01:15:08.572
No.

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:13.543
I found something.

01:15:14.778 --> 01:15:16.445
What did you find?

01:15:18.582 --> 01:15:20.016
Love letters.

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:21.017
Not from me.

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:23.653
I know it wasn't right,

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.889
but of all the things I've been,

01:15:25.989 --> 01:15:30.059
your father was the one thing
that I couldn't let go of.

01:15:32.562 --> 01:15:34.564
Dad, I'm really sorry.

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:39.268
Dad?

01:15:42.906 --> 01:15:45.008
You'd still call me that?

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:49.345
You'll always be my dad to me.

01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:52.649
No.

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:56.753
It'll hurt.

01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:02.158
It won't hurt.

01:16:10.033 --> 01:16:12.035
What happened?

01:16:12.135 --> 01:16:14.137
What's happened is you two
have just made history.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:15.639
Jesus Christ.

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:16.505
Sorry.

01:16:16.606 --> 01:16:19.108
I didn't mean to startle you.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.610
You must be Lamont.

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:21.611
Yes.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:24.712
Although, I've told you
that several times already.

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:25.682
Not to worry.

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:29.218
The effects will wear off shortly.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:30.987
What happened to us?

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:34.658
What happened is that
instead of one survivor,

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:36.425
we have two survivors.

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:38.995
So rather than your having
to split the reward,

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.830
I'll simply double it.

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:44.067
Oh my God.

01:16:45.134 --> 01:16:45.969
Of course,

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:50.006
you'll have to surrender
all the recordings you made.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:50.840
Sure.

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:52.575
Good.

01:16:52.676 --> 01:16:55.078
I look forward to seeing them.

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:00.383
The creature has found rest now.

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:02.351
For how long, who knows?

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:06.455
I wish I could tell you
more about the ending.

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:07.757
But I had help.

01:17:07.857 --> 01:17:09.425
So, I meant to ask you?

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:10.827
Yes?

01:17:10.927 --> 01:17:12.896
So I only have 1/2 the story.

01:17:12.996 --> 01:17:16.099
And my memory of it all is fading fast.

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:19.769
If we can just get you
to sign some of these.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:21.237
And there's some mercy in knowing

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:23.673
Angelina will forget as well.

01:17:30.146 --> 01:17:30.980
We'll have some more forms

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.816
for you to sign later.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:35.584
Oh my God, Luke.

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:36.886
Mrs. Oats went crazy.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.722
She killed some people, and then...

01:17:38.822 --> 01:17:40.289
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:17:40.389 --> 01:17:44.260
It's gonna be...

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:50.900
It's gonna be okay.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:55.972
Is that it?

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:56.806
That's it, John.

01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:58.807
I hear you're a real miracle worker.

01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:01.778
Well, if the book does
what you say it will,

01:18:01.878 --> 01:18:03.046
then thank you.

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:08.718
Oh, John.

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.320
Mind the hooks.

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:19.528
Private journal from
a Luke Harding to a mister,

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.765
well, I didn't ask your name.

01:18:21.865 --> 01:18:24.633
So I'll just call you the surgeon.

01:18:24.734 --> 01:18:26.335
You haven't met me yet,

01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:29.705
but believe it or not, I've met you.

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:31.340
And if you trust me,

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.177
I can help you change your story.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:38.681
John.

01:18:39.783 --> 01:18:41.117
Anthony.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:42.886
I've been expecting you.
