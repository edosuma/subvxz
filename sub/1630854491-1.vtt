-Not so fast, Gran.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.724
this poor soul in
suspended animation,

but I, Phil Betterman,

02:29.858 --> 02:31.651

<i>I took his weapon,</i>

02:35.238 --> 02:37.699
<i>We both loved exploring</i>

a bouquet of bones!

look up, and hwam!

ever stop eating?

food was scarce

04:37.152 --> 04:38.653

it called again?

Wow! Second, I'm going

There's a better way.

seem so familiar?

I could see more

08:41.688 --> 08:42.564
Teach me...

08:42.605 --> 08:44.691
-Sure! Here's lesson one.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.152
Lesson two! Stop following us!

08:47.193 --> 08:49.738
-See you later, punch pal!
-Yeah! Can't wait!

08:49.779 --> 08:52.282
Maybe later today? I'm
available. All day.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.159
No presh!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.786
-And that's my favorite
teeth hole.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.913
-Okay, tour's over.
-I can't believe

08:58.955 --> 09:01.166
you settled down in one place.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.959
You, settled down.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.754
-I know. Far cry
from the life of adventure

09:05.795 --> 09:08.465
I <i>thought</i>I'd be living.
With you.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.967
-So let's go.
-Go? Where?

09:11.009 --> 09:14.387
-To eat. Just you, me,
and whatever we catch.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.972
-Mm, you're on.

09:16.014 --> 09:19.351
I'll go grab us some weapons.
Meet you at the lagoon.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.644
-The lagoon doesn't
have avalanches, does it?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.563
Also, what's a lagoon?

09:23.605 --> 09:24.689
[ice clinking]

09:24.731 --> 09:26.733
-I think it's so sweet--

09:26.775 --> 09:28.151
Ow! That Gran and Hwam were--

09:28.193 --> 09:30.612
Gah! Reunited after
all this time.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.781
Ow! Why are burnips so hot?!

09:32.822 --> 09:35.492
-I hope I meet someone,
fall in love,

09:35.533 --> 09:36.910
and then that person
gets frozen--

09:36.951 --> 09:38.870
Ow! For a really long time,

09:38.912 --> 09:41.164
but then thaws out,
and we get back together.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.123
Ow!

09:42.165 --> 09:43.625
UGGA:
Sure. Or you realize that

09:43.667 --> 09:45.377
you're completely different
people than you used to be.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.837
I mean, a lot has changed
since they were together.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.173
What if it doesn't work out?
What if Gran gets hurt?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.758
-Can Gran get hurt?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.719
One time, I saw a boulder fall
on her, and she just giggled.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.471
-What do we even know about this
guy? I mean--

09:56.513 --> 09:57.847
Ouch! Just shows up--

09:57.889 --> 09:59.641
Ah! Out of nowhere--

09:59.683 --> 10:01.976
Oh! And expects us to trust him?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.270
-We trusted <i>you</i>, Guy-boy.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.482
-[muffled] Mm. Totally different
situations. Night and day.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.317
-[Gran mumbling]
-Gran?

10:09.359 --> 10:11.361
Why are you helping yourself
to all of my good knives?

10:11.403 --> 10:13.822
-Hwam and I are going
on a hunt picnic!

10:13.863 --> 10:16.866
Eat or be eaten, like
the good old days.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.577
-Aw! That sounds romantic.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.995
-Mom, are you sure about this?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.206
I mean, are you sure
you and Hwam

10:23.248 --> 10:25.250
should just pick up
where you left off?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.668
-I'm glad you asked that

10:26.710 --> 10:30.005
because it's none
of your business!

10:30.046 --> 10:33.216
-Wait! Gran! You can't go
on a picnic like <i>that</i>.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.052
This calls for some Betterman
bettering!

10:36.094 --> 10:38.930
-Huh?
-Yes! I love a project!

10:39.806 --> 10:41.266
* *

10:41.307 --> 10:43.268
-I'm glad you invited
me to talk to Hwam.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.394
-I didn't invite you.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.855
-Exactly! I don't trust
this guy either.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.398
[grunts, gasps]

10:50.942 --> 10:52.944
-[grunts] Attack forest?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.237
-Neat!
-UGGA: Hey, Hwam.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.947
We haven't had much of a chance

10:55.989 --> 10:57.824
to get to know each other.
Tell us about yourself.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.034
-Well--
-Yeah, enough chit-chat.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.077
I'd like to know
your intentions with my mom.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.328
-Tell her your intentions!

11:02.370 --> 11:03.913
-Coming in a little
hot there, Guy.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.206
-My intentions with Gran?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.542
Well, I guess I just want
her to be happy.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.252
-And.
-Yeah! And?!

11:09.294 --> 11:10.337
-That's it.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.671
-Huh. That's actually
a good answer.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.089
-It's the perfect answer.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.966
Perfect for hiding something.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.426
What are you hiding, Hwam?

11:16.468 --> 11:17.969
-Answer me!
-Guy.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.763
I need you to take
it down a notch.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.473
-I get it, Ugga Crood.
You don't know me.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.932
You have no reason to trust me.

11:22.974 --> 11:25.018
But, I love your mom.
I've loved her from the moment

11:25.060 --> 11:27.604
she tried to gouge my eyes out
and keep them as trophies.

11:27.645 --> 11:28.772
Nothing has changed.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.107
-For you, but a lot
has changed for her.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.777
Aside from the gouging part.
She has a family now.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.946
-I know, but what's important
to Gran is important to me.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.449
I'd never let anything bad
happen to any of you.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.825
-[snap]
-Hm?

11:42.369 --> 11:45.121
And I'd never let anything bad
happen to your mom.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.373
She means the world to me,

11:46.414 --> 11:48.708
which is why I can't
keep her waiting again.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.460
-Hm. I like him.
-I know.

11:50.502 --> 11:53.213
-I don't trust him either.
-Just wondering,

11:53.254 --> 11:55.674
has there ever been
a avalanche at the lagoon?

11:55.715 --> 11:56.841
[ice clinking]

11:56.883 --> 11:58.301
GRAN: This is dumb!

11:58.343 --> 12:01.262
Only reason I'm letting you do
this is to shut you up!

12:01.304 --> 12:04.391
-I think you're doing this
because you wanna impress Hwam.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.725
-I never said that!

12:05.767 --> 12:09.062
-You didn't have to.
We can see it in your eyes.

12:09.104 --> 12:11.690
-Stop looking at my eyes
or I'll gouge out yours!

12:11.731 --> 12:13.191
-[gasps]
-Don't worry, Gran.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.069
Hwam's jaw is gonna drop
when he sees you!

12:16.111 --> 12:18.113
As soon as we do something
about your hair.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.906
-Brush.
-DAWN: Brush!

12:21.032 --> 12:23.159
-Bigger brush.
-Bigger brush!

12:24.869 --> 12:25.829
-Rake.
-Rake!

12:25.870 --> 12:27.706
-That's it! I'm leaving!

12:27.747 --> 12:31.209
-Oh no. You're not
going <i>anywhere!</i>

12:31.251 --> 12:32.419
-Oh...

12:32.460 --> 12:35.588
-[screaming]
-Get back here and be better!

12:35.630 --> 12:38.591
[birds cawing]

12:38.633 --> 12:40.135
-Oh hey, Hwam.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.886
-Sorry. I thought you
were lightning.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.221
-Glad I found you. I mean,

12:43.263 --> 12:45.515
not that I was looking
for you or anything.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.517
Uh, w-what's up?

12:47.559 --> 12:48.518
-The sky.

12:48.560 --> 12:49.769
[laughing]

12:49.811 --> 12:52.188
[both laugh]

12:52.230 --> 12:53.440
I don't understand the joke,

12:53.481 --> 12:55.358
but I like the feeling
of laughing.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.694
Anyway, I was just looking
for some bones to give to Gran,

12:57.736 --> 12:59.029
but I can't find any.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.072
-Oh, you're not gonna find
any bones around here.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.867
Hope runs a tight farm.
Sometimes, she takes the bones

13:03.908 --> 13:05.452
out of my mouth before
I'm done eating.

13:05.493 --> 13:09.706
-That's okay. There are gifts
everywhere you look. Ooh...

13:09.748 --> 13:11.124
Like these.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.794
-Banana peels? Those aren't
gifts. Those are garbage.

13:14.836 --> 13:18.590
-Grug, the peel is the most
important part of the banana.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.758
Think of it like a cave,

13:19.799 --> 13:21.134
-Banana cave?

13:21.176 --> 13:24.220
-Exactly. It keeps
the bananas safe and warm.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.389
It protects the banana
from animals,

13:26.431 --> 13:28.099
rain, avalanches.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.435
Without the peel, there's
no banana.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.729
[high-pitched note]

13:32.771 --> 13:35.106
-Wow. Banana brain blown.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.775
I've never thought
of it like that.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.901
Thank you, Hwam,

13:37.942 --> 13:39.277
for opening my eyes.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.321
-Your eyes were always
open, banana bud.

13:41.363 --> 13:44.866
You just needed someone
to help you see.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.409
HOPE:
Ah! Get back here!

13:46.451 --> 13:48.244
-What was that?!
-Ah, just someone screaming.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.580
So why do you need
a gift for Gran?

13:50.622 --> 13:52.165
-Oh. We're going on a picnic!

13:52.207 --> 13:54.417
-We are? Aw, great!
I love picnics!

13:54.459 --> 13:57.420
-Oh. Actually, I meant
just me and Gran.

13:57.462 --> 14:00.256
-Oh. Cool. Yeah,
that makes sense.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.050
Well, I guess
I'll just see you later then.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.427
-Sounds great!
-* *

14:04.469 --> 14:07.597
-Later tonight. Or-or first
thing tomorrow. I'm wide open!

14:07.639 --> 14:09.057
[ice clinking]

14:09.808 --> 14:11.518
[confused mumbling]

14:11.559 --> 14:13.853
-[sighs] He's not coming.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.022
Frozen once, shame on him.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.483
Frozen twice, shame on me.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.611
Guess that means we can
go hunting, Sandy!

14:21.653 --> 14:23.029
-Gran! Wait!
-[gasps]

14:23.071 --> 14:24.781
Sorry I'm late. These
are for you.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.117
-Aw, banana peels!

14:27.158 --> 14:29.703
Can you believe some people
think these are garbage?

14:29.744 --> 14:30.954
[sniffs, sighs]

14:30.995 --> 14:32.497
-Did you have any trouble
with the weapons?

14:32.539 --> 14:33.707
-Not at all,

14:33.748 --> 14:36.668
but I did have some trouble
with my hair.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.794
Worked it out, though.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.588
-[muffled yelling]
-[Sandy giggling]

14:40.630 --> 14:41.965
* *

14:42.007 --> 14:44.009
-I missed this.
-Missed what?

14:44.050 --> 14:45.719
-Being alive, smelling,

14:45.760 --> 14:47.137
seeing, eating,

14:47.178 --> 14:50.265
and whatever the other senses
are. It's amazing.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.975
So is the farm and your family.

14:52.017 --> 14:54.728
-Yeah. I didn't think I'd like
'em, but I do.

14:54.769 --> 14:57.105
Ugga's the mom I wish I'd been.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.691
Eep's more fearless
than I ever was.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.484
Sandy's a born fighter.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.611
<i>Thunk and Bareback</i>

<i>Top Knot, and Braids.</i>

<i>And then there's Grug.</i>

15:08.908 --> 15:10.368
HWAM:
<i>Yeah. He's the best.</i>

15:10.410 --> 15:13.121
-Eh, wouldn't go that far,
but I haven't killed him yet,

15:13.163 --> 15:16.166
-so he could be worse.
-FAMILY: Aw...

15:16.207 --> 15:18.835
-I take it all back!
Come on, Hwam!

15:18.877 --> 15:21.838
Let's go have some fun <i>alone.</i>

15:50.200 --> 15:52.410
And that was the fifth
time I died.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.039
You can fight lava,
but lava always wins.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.708
It was the greatest
moment of my life!

15:58.750 --> 16:00.085
Or that life, anyway.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.586
-You've lived so many lives.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.963
You've done and seen
so many things.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.548
-I'm sorry I wasn't
there with you.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.385
-I am, too.
But it wasn't your fault.

16:08.426 --> 16:11.596
-I know, but now that I'm here,
I wanna make up for lost time.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.641
-That sounds nice.
-I was hoping you'd say that

16:14.683 --> 16:16.643
because I have an idea.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.437
[overlapping chatter]

16:20.939 --> 16:23.400
-Everybody shut it!
We've got news!

16:23.441 --> 16:25.402
Hwam and I are leaving.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.903
-What do you mean leaving?
To go hunt?

16:26.945 --> 16:30.240
-Nope! We're going to see
the world, and then beat it up!

16:30.281 --> 16:32.867
Just like we always planned.
We leave tonight!

16:32.909 --> 16:34.119
* *

16:34.869 --> 16:36.621
-Who's that guy?

16:38.707 --> 16:40.667
[Gran grunting]

16:43.878 --> 16:45.296
-Hey, Mom, can we talk?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.966
-Sure.
After you hand me that ax.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.342
[sighs]

16:49.384 --> 16:51.136
No, the travel ax.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.304
-I'm really happy for you,

16:53.346 --> 16:55.682
but... are you sure about this?

16:55.724 --> 16:57.851
-You think if you keep
asking that question,

16:57.892 --> 16:59.185
you'll get a different answer?

16:59.227 --> 17:01.688
I'm not getting any
younger, Ugga! Spear.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.190
-What about the farm?
The Thunder Sisters?

17:04.232 --> 17:06.860
Your family? Me?

17:06.901 --> 17:09.529
-You'll be fine. Besides,

17:09.571 --> 17:12.782
this is a chance to see
the life I <i>could've</i>had!

17:12.824 --> 17:14.993
-What about the life
you already have?

17:15.035 --> 17:16.870
-I've lived that life.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.748
Time to check out a new one.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.583
-First, I was worried
<i>you</i>were gonna get hurt,

17:21.624 --> 17:24.878
but now I feel like
<i>I'm</i>gonna get hurt.

17:26.129 --> 17:29.257
-You'll be fine.
You always are.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.885
Just like me.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.638
-[bark]
-Eh?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.390
-Snack for the road.
-Mom.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.017
-Oh, alright!

17:39.768 --> 17:40.769
[grunts]

17:42.687 --> 17:44.773
-I can't believe you're
leaving already.

17:44.814 --> 17:45.815
-What am I gonna do?

17:45.857 --> 17:47.400
-You're gonna be okay,
Grug Crood.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.569
This isn't goodbye forever.
I'll be back.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.237
-When? Tomorrow?
-No.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.697
-The day after tomorrow?
-Probably not.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.407
-The day after the
day after tomorrow?

17:54.449 --> 17:56.242
-No, but someday.
-What day?!

17:56.284 --> 17:57.744
I need to know! I
need to know now!

17:57.786 --> 18:00.455
-I'll be back before you
know it. I promise.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.165
I got you something.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.833
-A corn cob?

18:04.834 --> 18:06.461
Wait. I-I see it now.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.339
This cob holds
all the corn kernels together,

18:09.381 --> 18:12.467
keeping them connected and safe.
Just like me.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.969
-Now, you're getting
it, corn dog.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.597
-I gave him my heart,

18:17.639 --> 18:20.100
and he gave me a cob. Hm.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.851
Pretty sweet deal.

18:21.893 --> 18:25.063
HWAM: So I was thinking we could
go to the Flame Fields first,

18:25.105 --> 18:26.439
then take a short detour

18:26.481 --> 18:28.441
to check out
the Burning Bog, and <i>then,</i>

18:28.483 --> 18:32.112
maybe spend a few moons
in Pyro Prairie.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.364
Or is that too much fire?

18:34.406 --> 18:36.658
-No such thing as
too much fire.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.785
But I've already been
to those places.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.287
-No problem. We'll just go
somewhere else that's on fire.

18:41.329 --> 18:44.124
-Like Combustion Canyon
or Inferno Island

18:44.165 --> 18:46.292
or the Blazing Bluffs.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.169
-Been to all those, too.

18:48.211 --> 18:49.546
-Well, I don't care
where we go,

18:49.587 --> 18:51.464
as long as we're together.
And hey,

18:51.506 --> 18:53.299
when you're done packing,
your family has

18:53.341 --> 18:54.509
a little surprise for us.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.302
Isn't that exciting? I mean,

18:56.344 --> 18:58.805
as long as the surprise
isn't another avalanche.

18:58.847 --> 19:00.098
[ice clinking]

19:00.140 --> 19:02.308
-We knew you wouldn't
want a farewell dinner,

19:02.350 --> 19:05.270
so instead, this is your
farewell fight.

19:05.311 --> 19:09.065
GRAN:
Aw, you know me too well.

19:09.107 --> 19:10.316
Let's do this!

19:10.358 --> 19:12.777
Eyes and teeth are
all fair game!

19:12.819 --> 19:14.821
-I'll go first.
I'm gonna miss you, Mom.

19:14.863 --> 19:17.365
I'll miss your cackle
and the way you--

19:17.407 --> 19:19.492
-Keep it short! I don't
have all day!

19:19.534 --> 19:21.494
-I'm gonna miss your
amazing stories,

19:21.536 --> 19:24.789
and how you're scary
even when you're not trying!

19:24.831 --> 19:27.000
-Gran, I'm gonna miss
our adventures.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.126
Ow!

19:28.168 --> 19:30.545
-I'm not gonna miss
anything about you

19:30.587 --> 19:32.339
because I'm coming with you!

19:32.380 --> 19:34.174
-Not a chance, meat-neck!

19:34.215 --> 19:36.760
-And I'm gonna miss
the wisdom of a wise old...

19:36.801 --> 19:39.054
A-and by old, I mean
experienced--

19:41.389 --> 19:43.892
Oh, it's you. Uh, thanks, Hwam.

19:43.933 --> 19:47.020
So, hitting the road, huh?
Need any help packing?

19:47.062 --> 19:48.355
-I admire you, Guy.

19:48.396 --> 19:50.190
While everyone else welcomed me
with open arms,

19:50.231 --> 19:52.776
you didn't because you were
trying to protect them.

19:52.817 --> 19:56.029
Because you care about them.
You're their banana peel.

19:56.071 --> 19:57.530
[whimpers]

19:57.572 --> 19:59.449
-[crying]
I'm gonna miss you so much!

19:59.491 --> 20:01.701
-Have a good trip.
See you when you get back.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.745
Ah! Why?

20:03.787 --> 20:06.790
-Braids! Top Knot!
It's bye-bye time.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.292
-If we're not going to miss
living in fear,

20:09.334 --> 20:10.543
do we still have to fight?

20:10.585 --> 20:12.712
-Hm, let me think
about that. Yes!

20:12.754 --> 20:14.464
[Guy and Hope screaming]

20:14.506 --> 20:16.216
-[growling]
-Go on, Sandy.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.759
Give me all you got!

20:19.386 --> 20:20.845
[sad purring]

20:20.887 --> 20:22.263
Oh--

20:22.305 --> 20:24.766
Hm...

20:24.808 --> 20:27.644
I'm gonna miss you, too, Sandy.

20:27.686 --> 20:30.355
I'm gonna miss all of
you. Except Grug.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.273
-Because I'm coming with you?
-No!

20:32.315 --> 20:33.400
* *

20:33.441 --> 20:35.360
-This is a long-distance
speak-in-shell,

20:35.402 --> 20:36.486
so you'll always be in touch.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.071
At least until you
run out of vine,

20:38.113 --> 20:39.739
which will probably be
just past the hill,

20:39.781 --> 20:41.157
so never mind. Give it back.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.660
-[grunts] Dad said it would be
too hard to say goodbye,

20:43.702 --> 20:46.037
but he wanted you to
take this with you.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.125
* *

20:53.461 --> 20:54.838
[Sandy grunts]

20:54.879 --> 20:58.133
-[sighs] Hwam, I need
to talk to you.

21:00.635 --> 21:03.471
[sighs] I can't go.

21:03.513 --> 21:05.932
-Oh. You wanna leave tomorrow?
-No.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.435
-I can't go. Ever.
-What do you mean?

21:08.476 --> 21:10.645
I thought we were
gonna start our life together.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.522
-I already have a life.

21:12.564 --> 21:15.608
Here. On the farm.
With my family.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.610
And I can't leave that behind.

21:17.652 --> 21:19.070
FAMILY: Aw...

21:19.112 --> 21:21.781
-Get your googly eyes outta here
before I gouge them out

21:21.823 --> 21:23.033
and turn them into a necklace!

21:23.074 --> 21:25.243
-Well, then I'll stay
here with you.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.620
-Hm. I'd like that, but...

21:27.662 --> 21:29.748
-But there's a world out there
I haven't seen.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.751
A world you <i>have</i>seen.
A world I <i>need</i>to see.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.379
-And I can't be the reason
you don't see it.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.381
* *

21:38.423 --> 21:40.925
-I knew there'd be
another avalanche.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.970
I'll be back. And-and I'll
bring you something dead!

21:44.012 --> 21:47.307
-Will you wait for me?
-Not if it takes as
long as last time.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.476
Just kidding. I'll be here.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.311
It's possible I can't die.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.480
-[soft laugh] Goodbye,
everyone!

21:53.521 --> 21:54.898
It was a pleasure meeting
all of you.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.442
Oh, and please tell Grug
I said thanks for the basket.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.777
[struggling]

21:58.818 --> 22:00.445
Why is this basket so heavy?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.447
-Because Grug's in it.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.491
GRUG: [muffled]
No, I'm not!

22:04.532 --> 22:07.118
* *

22:08.370 --> 22:11.539
HWAM: Mm... mwah!

22:12.415 --> 22:13.833
[both sigh]

22:14.542 --> 22:17.087
[squishing]

22:17.128 --> 22:19.381
I think this is yours.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.049
-Thanks.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.686
-[Sandy growling]
-Huh?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.562
-[growling]
-Good call, Cindy.

22:34.604 --> 22:37.107
Less tears, more spears.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.150
Let's go hunting!

22:39.192 --> 22:41.403
GRUG: [muffled]
I'm still not in this basket!

22:41.444 --> 22:44.698
* *
