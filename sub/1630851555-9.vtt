WEBVTT

00:06.047 --> 00:07.549
I never met my father.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.050
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:09.134 --> 00:11.469
My grandma raised me in a Yucatan town.

00:12.303 --> 00:15.974
We believe that those who die
at the hands of others

00:16.057 --> 00:20.145
can't move on to their next life
until justice is done.

00:21.604 --> 00:23.857
That's not a valid theory
for the authorities.

00:24.816 --> 00:28.820
And forgive me, but the memories
of a four-year-old girl…

00:30.238 --> 00:31.322
There's a witness.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.702
My rescuer saw the man.

00:35.785 --> 00:40.040
If an investigation is launched,
he could help them find him.

00:41.833 --> 00:46.004
Counselor, my mother
guided me towards you for a reason.

00:46.796 --> 00:47.630
Help me.

00:53.386 --> 00:56.723
Why now? Why 20 years later?

00:56.806 --> 00:59.934
I didn't have the courage
to face my guilt until now.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.313
Because guilt is a monster
that gets stronger

01:03.396 --> 01:07.400
and takes over everything we have
if we don't deal with it.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.695
I dreamed of my mother once.

01:10.779 --> 01:13.406
She was covered in blood,
begging me for help.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.201
Like at the car crash.

01:17.368 --> 01:21.915
I have to find whoever did it,
or she'll never rest in peace.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.585
Well, I…

01:28.463 --> 01:31.508
I'll do everything I can,
but I can't promise anything.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.403
Boss.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.740
Another daughter.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.667
Another daughter.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.677
Do you think when…

02:17.303 --> 02:18.555
When people die,

02:20.807 --> 02:24.936
they keep lurking around
if they have any scores to settle?

02:28.898 --> 02:29.899
I had to do it.

02:31.526 --> 02:36.072
I had to let her die.
It was either that or turning myself in.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.534
You did what you could.

02:40.034 --> 02:43.496
You didn't know a kid was in the car,
let alone yours.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.876
First Manny, then a nun.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.503
And now this one.

02:52.088 --> 02:55.675
The nun's not dangerous,
Manny is dead and the other one…

02:56.509 --> 02:59.929
I'll fly over there
and get rid of the witness, no worries.

03:05.059 --> 03:07.103
You know how many broads I've screwed?

03:08.438 --> 03:12.650
Who knows how many kids
are running around out there?

03:17.071 --> 03:19.365
It must be at the confirmation hearing

03:19.449 --> 03:22.410
and I need to be up front
where he can see me.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.038
What do you need?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.750
A VIP pass like the ones politicians have.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.128
I can call Julia,
but not knowing what they look like…

03:33.338 --> 03:37.050
I know of a better place.
A direct way and the perfect place.

03:37.133 --> 03:41.346
Manny, the wig and the jacket
are only if you need to go outside.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.724
Nobody knows I'm dead
where I'm talking about.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.813
You were right, Inés.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.317
The medical research is great news.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.738
I'd be nothing but grateful to you

03:58.821 --> 04:02.325
and this noble institution
for taking care of my mom.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.203
I also wanted…

04:06.663 --> 04:08.164
to apologize

04:08.831 --> 04:11.876
for overreacting like that.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.671
No problem.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.259
It's only natural
for you to worry about her.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.264
I committed the sin of arrogance.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.642
I prayed all weekend.

04:28.226 --> 04:32.981
I asked God
to grant me tolerance and humility.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.318
May I see my mom?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.738
Only if you think it's safe, of course.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.916
What have they done to her, Hugo?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.336
I don't know, but they sent her back
to the same galaxy.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.797
Look after her, Hugo.

04:57.880 --> 05:03.136
She's on an IV now
that the boss Inés monitors personally.

05:03.761 --> 05:09.058
Yes, do whatever Inés says,
but I need you to protect her

05:09.767 --> 05:11.936
while I find a way to get her out of here.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.274
Only the dead and the dying
ever leave this place.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.576
YUCATÁN

05:35.960 --> 05:37.378
As I told the young lady,

05:37.462 --> 05:40.381
there's no reason to think
the woman didn't die instantly.

05:41.257 --> 05:45.178
I'm investigating the case,
so I need to review the evidence.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.096
ACTRESS NICTÉ MAI DEAD

05:47.180 --> 05:48.806
Aren't there any witnesses?

05:51.434 --> 05:54.687
She says a guy named Yumil
rescued her after the crash.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.689
Can I speak with him?

06:17.543 --> 06:20.588
That's him, but don't get your hopes up.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.216
He says he rescued the girl from the car,

06:23.299 --> 06:26.052
but also that Malinche
reincarnated seven times

06:26.135 --> 06:27.762
and she's the new governor.

06:31.849 --> 06:35.645
Mr. Yumil, I'm Víctor.
I work for a Mexico City law firm.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.443
Look.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.771
What a great actor you are, Yumil.
You should be acting in soaps.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.526
Not only did the old man recognize him,

07:23.609 --> 07:26.571
Rodríguez took a video
while Víctor questioned him

07:26.654 --> 07:30.324
with Marroquín's picture in it,
he's sending it to me.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.705
Thanks, Lorenzo!

07:40.751 --> 07:45.381
I only spoke with my colleague.
You did all the hard work.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.928
I have to go.
I only came to give you the good news.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.222
Good luck.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.275
Well, well.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.527
Look who showed up.

08:08.863 --> 08:12.533
Thanks for taking me back.
Did you book Mr. Suárez?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.285
He paid for two hours.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.330
No cameras, right?

08:17.413 --> 08:19.665
I know, but I need the money.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.502
-Okay. Go get ready.
-Thanks.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.926
I'm leaving. Will that be all?

08:30.801 --> 08:32.845
How does she look since she came back?

08:33.846 --> 08:36.390
Bad, she looks like a zombie.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.727
Why, boss?

08:41.562 --> 08:45.858
Dr. Zapata's report says that Alice
didn't respond well to the treatment.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.362
Her brain damage is permanent.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.991
She could die at any time.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.012
Are you ready, Mr. Suárez?

09:15.721 --> 09:18.307
-Thank you, Gallo.
-Go right ahead.

09:22.478 --> 09:26.566
Don't worry, man.
Your boss is in good hands.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.070
Two. Tequila or mezcal?

09:31.153 --> 09:33.114
-Tequila.
-Two tequilas.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.241
It's not him I'm worried about.

09:35.866 --> 09:41.122
He snorted three lines of coke
and almost a whole bottle of whiskey.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.583
It's your stripper I'm worried about.

09:43.666 --> 09:47.628
No worries.
Manny can take care of herself, dude.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.756
Did you say Manny?

09:52.258 --> 09:53.634
Yes, she's back.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.763
It's as if she came back
from the grave, dude.

10:01.892 --> 10:05.646
-Suárez, listen to me.
-Shut up.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.941
Be quiet.

10:10.109 --> 10:10.943
That's it.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.362
-Suárez, listen.
-No.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.989
-Suárez.
-Enjoy it.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.365
Listen, Suárez.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.368
-I said no, you whore.
-Wait.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.541
No way!

10:27.376 --> 10:28.586
Are you okay?

10:28.669 --> 10:31.714
Calm down. I'm his driver. Are you okay?

10:34.425 --> 10:35.718
Weren't you dead?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.055
Fede went to your funeral.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.269
I need your help.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.697
Lord help me!

11:00.034 --> 11:01.494
Where am I, dude?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.247
-Where am I?
-We're in your room, sir.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.041
Sir.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.738
VIP ACCESS

11:43.035 --> 11:44.995
See you tomorrow at noon, sir?

12:05.474 --> 12:07.935
Your sister can sit next to Marroquín
with this.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.148
Don't worry about him.
He'll wake up very late tomorrow.

12:12.898 --> 12:13.733
Okay?

12:18.070 --> 12:18.904
Thanks.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.073
Sure.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.951
I worry about Federico.

12:24.660 --> 12:27.413
About deceiving him.
But it's for his sake.

12:28.622 --> 12:32.376
It's the last favor I need.
Don't tell him anything.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.256
Look, I'm only doing this

12:37.339 --> 12:40.843
because if it's true
he almost screwed his sister,

12:40.926 --> 12:43.637
his dad deserves
to have his balls cut off.

12:47.808 --> 12:51.395
-Where to?
-Santa María de los Ángeles convent.

12:54.064 --> 12:54.899
What?

12:55.816 --> 12:56.650
Nothing.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.572
Or your place.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.310
I saw you flirting with him.

13:31.393 --> 13:34.814
I didn't even see who was asking
to take a picture.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.359
You wanted him to grope you, didn't you?

13:38.442 --> 13:41.487
-Don't touch me.
-Women are such sluts!

13:43.739 --> 13:47.535
Call Daniel tomorrow.
Tell him we're not playing on Thursday.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.871
No. We have to be there.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.667
-You have a date with that guy, right?
-Oh, please!

13:55.709 --> 13:56.544
You know what?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.797
We're never playing in that damn bar!

14:00.464 --> 14:01.632
It's not the only one.

14:02.132 --> 14:03.300
You know what?

14:03.384 --> 14:06.887
Don't go if you don't want to.
I can't do that to Daniel.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.599
Don't act like a whore with me.
You hear me?

14:11.433 --> 14:14.770
Nobody makes a fool of me.
Not you or any woman.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.896
Let go!

14:17.815 --> 14:18.899
Asshole.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.862
His ex-girlfriend
had to get a restraining order

14:23.904 --> 14:25.698
to keep him away from her.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.825
Why didn't you tell me?

14:31.161 --> 14:32.705
The wedding was inevitable.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.211
And I thought Pocho would change.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.798
That relationship must end.

14:44.133 --> 14:48.220
Or the scary vision I had of Matilde
on her wedding day will come true.

14:51.891 --> 14:52.975
Come in.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.522
Sorry about the mess.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.735
Want something to drink?

15:11.493 --> 15:12.453
What are you doing?

15:13.037 --> 15:14.455
Returning the favor.

15:16.415 --> 15:17.750
I know nothing is free.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.170
You're a nice guy. I want to do it.

15:29.845 --> 15:34.224
The first time I saw you dancing
at the club,

15:34.934 --> 15:40.189
I thought a woman like you
would never look at a guy like me.

15:42.566 --> 15:46.111
You're one of most beautiful women
I've ever seen, Manny.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.208
Want me to fix dinner?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.057
The doctor was very hopeful
the treatment would work.

16:16.141 --> 16:16.976
I know.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.855
We knew we'd lose her some day.

16:22.439 --> 16:23.899
But not so soon.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.779
Can we move her to the convent?

16:29.863 --> 16:32.449
It would be very comforting

16:32.533 --> 16:35.953
to keep her company and pray with her
while she's alive.

16:37.579 --> 16:41.083
I'll ask the doctor if it's okay.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.795
He makes all the decisions.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.964
Thank you, Inés.

16:48.173 --> 16:52.052
May God repay you a hundredfold
for helping my mom.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.514
I HAD TO LEAVE EARLY
HERE'S MY NUMBER. GOOD LUCK, MANNY!

17:43.187 --> 17:47.483
I'm authorizing the transfer
due to the patient's condition.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.820
Forgive me for asking, Doctor,
but what happened?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.614
It was so sudden.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.200
Inés, nobody can know about this.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.160
After her seizure,

17:58.243 --> 18:03.040
the order was to use very high doses
to relax the nervous system.

18:03.123 --> 18:06.251
But I can't say that in the report, can I?

18:06.335 --> 18:08.003
I understand, Doctor.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.547
-Don't worry about it.
-Bye.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.429
I kept my part of the deal.

18:17.513 --> 18:21.809
I reported brain damage and authorized
her transfer to the convent.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.186
Did you notify the foundation?

18:24.269 --> 18:29.942
I sent it to a trustee who is abroad,
so the red flags won't pop up too fast.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.654
Now do your part and issue my pardon

18:33.737 --> 18:36.990
and my protection status
in exchange for the information.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.325
We will.

18:39.451 --> 18:42.579
After you repeat everything you told me
in your office.

18:43.872 --> 18:44.957
On tape this time.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.836
No video, no deal,
and you'll go to jail without a deal.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.714
Don't be like that. Cheer up.

18:53.423 --> 18:57.427
Twenty years working for the devil.
Wasn't it time to switch sides?

19:18.615 --> 19:21.368
-Víctor's here for you.
-Tell him I'm coming.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.745
You'll be fine, Simón.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.416
You wrote your speech a month ago.
You'll be fine.

19:27.499 --> 19:28.333
Right.

19:30.002 --> 19:30.961
I'm coming.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.004
Take it easy.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.221
The geezer is nuts, boss.

19:41.305 --> 19:46.351
Nobody would be surprised if he died
of a heart attack or something at night.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.105
Let me know if that helps.

19:52.441 --> 19:56.904
You've been doing the family's dirty work
for years now,

19:57.613 --> 20:00.365
without ever hesitating for a second.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.327
Can you sleep?

20:04.828 --> 20:08.457
My job is to protect you guys, boss.
I sleep like a log.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.677
Please, let us interview you, sir.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.139
Come on. It's for channel six, please!

20:27.643 --> 20:29.269
Honorable senators,

20:29.937 --> 20:32.606
I'll tell you more about my past
in a moment,

20:32.689 --> 20:34.566
but first I'd like to thank you

20:34.650 --> 20:37.486
for the opportunity
to address you here today.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.988
First of all I want to…

20:57.923 --> 20:58.882
Excuse me.

21:00.842 --> 21:04.805
I was saying that I'd like to begin
with my experience…

21:04.888 --> 21:06.848
Where do you stand on abortion?

21:10.602 --> 21:13.230
Valentina de la Paz, Alternativa Magazine.

21:13.730 --> 21:18.235
Where do you stand regarding women
who are forced to have abortions?

21:19.069 --> 21:22.155
Whose crime is it,
hers or the man forcing her?

21:27.494 --> 21:28.328
I'll do it.

21:30.872 --> 21:34.126
What's the matter?
Can't you answer my question?

21:37.296 --> 21:40.257
Sorry about that, Mr. Marroquín.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.466
Please continue.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.010
Yes.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.308
As I was saying, as an attorney,

21:49.391 --> 21:53.562
and a volunteer for five years in area 23,

21:54.104 --> 21:57.190
that helped me to continue learning

21:59.234 --> 22:00.527
how the system worked.

22:01.320 --> 22:06.658
I grew there little by little studying law
and working hard…

22:06.742 --> 22:07.826
Valentina.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.163
Cheers.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.960
Lots of guys wish they had your balls.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.546
Simón acted weird from the beginning.

22:19.629 --> 22:23.216
It's his guilty conscience.
I felt it at his office.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.762
We toast with champagne, not beer,
when he's locked up.

22:26.845 --> 22:27.679
Yes!

22:28.263 --> 22:31.641
Before I forget,
here's Dr. Zapata's video confession

22:31.725 --> 22:35.103
that Marroquín ordered him
to drug Alice all these years

22:35.187 --> 22:36.521
to keep her quiet.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.190
Thanks.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.067
We need to toast again.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.570
My mom was transferred.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.031
Really? Congratulations!

22:46.114 --> 22:46.948
Cheers.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.245
Hey!

22:52.913 --> 22:54.373
Well… okay.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.707
My cue to leave.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.253
Me too, before my mom
starts calling me like crazy.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.173
-Right.
-You're back at the apartment?

23:03.256 --> 23:05.675
Simón left Mom in peace when I died.

23:06.426 --> 23:09.429
And I really can't take another Mass, nun.

23:12.265 --> 23:15.394
Okay, detective,
I think we need to leave too,

23:15.477 --> 23:18.397
because Valentina
needs to prepare for tomorrow.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.940
-Please.
-Let's go.

23:20.023 --> 23:20.857
Be careful.

23:21.441 --> 23:22.651
-Bye.
-Bye.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.295
VALENTINA DE LA PAZ
THIS ACCOUNT IS PRIVATE

23:42.379 --> 23:44.089
What? She blocked me?

23:44.172 --> 23:46.633
No way!

23:47.426 --> 23:48.260
Damn!

23:54.307 --> 23:55.225
There you are.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.762
You looked like a damn rookie.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.349
As if you'd never been on a damn podium.

24:37.767 --> 24:41.271
I couldn't sleep last night.
I'm exhausted.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.690
That's all I needed!

24:44.316 --> 24:49.654
Master Marroquín needs eight hours sleep
to talk as if he has a brain.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.657
I'll patch things up
with Bernardo tomorrow.

24:52.741 --> 24:57.037
I'll have to make up a story,
say you're sick or something, dammit!

25:07.088 --> 25:07.923
Rogelio.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.134
Who is that reporter? What did she want?

25:11.218 --> 25:13.637
I think she's from Alternativa magazine.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.765
A loser trying to go viral,
or whatever it's called.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.725
Catalina.

25:20.477 --> 25:24.189
Look after your husband.
A lot depends on his nomination.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.358
Yes.

25:28.026 --> 25:28.860
I know.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.532
Do you need anything
before I go to bed, ma'am?

25:33.615 --> 25:38.286
No one can know what's in the letter
you took out of the pool, Gracie.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.455
Especially Simón.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.667
What letter, ma'am?

25:50.465 --> 25:53.134
Whatever it is, please be careful.

25:54.803 --> 25:58.139
Mr. Simón is acting really weird recently.

26:01.601 --> 26:02.852
See you tomorrow.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.239
A young lady's here to see you, sir.

26:14.322 --> 26:17.033
-I'm not seeing anyone.
-Just five minutes.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.288
Call security.

26:21.371 --> 26:25.041
Please let me explain.
It was nothing personal. My mother was…

26:25.125 --> 26:26.668
None of my business.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.212
You knew her. Her name was Rosa Martínez.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.465
A man got her pregnant
and forced her to abort.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.260
I'm here because she escaped.

26:36.261 --> 26:39.514
I found out two months ago
when she died, sir.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.225
An abortion?

26:42.309 --> 26:44.477
Simón, I'm four months pregnant.

26:45.562 --> 26:49.774
You either do it,
or you and your family will suffer.

26:51.401 --> 26:52.319
Got it?

26:52.402 --> 26:55.780
Reporting violence against women
is my life's work.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.701
But this time
my feelings got the better of me,

26:59.784 --> 27:02.454
which is unprofessional.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.749
And I'm here to apologize.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.668
And also, if I may,

27:08.752 --> 27:12.088
to ask that
when you're Minister of Justice

27:12.172 --> 27:15.133
to help reform the Victim Protection Act.

27:16.426 --> 27:17.302
Do it for my mom,

27:18.928 --> 27:20.972
who that man caused so much pain.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.643
She was very attached
to you and your family.

27:25.143 --> 27:29.105
I'm sure that wherever she is,
she will repay you.

27:30.899 --> 27:31.816
That's all.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.027
Have a nice day.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.077
So now I'm losing my mind.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.788
Boss, you're not sure she's your kid.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.414
What are you, stupid?

27:46.498 --> 27:49.709
Rosa Martínez. A guy forced her to abort.

27:53.922 --> 27:58.259
You knew that brat and the other one
were alive.

27:58.343 --> 28:01.721
You're up to your neck in this shit.
What do you know?

28:02.806 --> 28:06.976
You're not thinking straight.
I took Rosa to Dr. Salgado.

28:07.686 --> 28:11.147
She assured me the procedure was done.
I saw the medical report.

28:11.856 --> 28:13.775
I showed you the photos, remember?

28:14.359 --> 28:17.904
The woman told her daughter
and she's lying to blackmail you.

28:23.159 --> 28:23.993
Leave.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.247
-Boss.
-Get out.

28:34.629 --> 28:39.217
The offices are up there.
See? All of that.

28:42.345 --> 28:45.890
-We could open a bar or something.
-Great.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.521
See? Cutting-edge technology.

28:53.314 --> 28:55.483
Wow, Uncle! I can't believe it!

28:55.567 --> 28:58.987
Well, start believing.
This will be a huge success.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.572
Look. This is Camilo.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.450
I finally meet the genius brewer.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.910
Nice to meet you. I'm impressed.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.538
-Do you like it?
-It's awesome.

29:10.206 --> 29:12.125
-Thank you.
-No. Thank you.

29:12.208 --> 29:13.501
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:24.929 --> 29:27.348
Julia, help me!

29:29.517 --> 29:32.771
You again, you bastard? Leave her alone!

29:39.736 --> 29:42.238
I can't believe this guy is back.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.992
A year ago he raped a little girl,
a friend's child.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.870
Can you believe
he only did one week in jail?

29:49.370 --> 29:50.872
Calm down. It's over.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.223
What are you looking at?

30:09.390 --> 30:10.391
Go away.

30:11.893 --> 30:12.727
Go away!

30:52.016 --> 30:55.728
Simón has you under surveillance
because he thinks we're allies.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.605
It's a good thing you saw him.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.858
If that rapist hadn't appeared,

30:59.941 --> 31:03.361
he would've followed me to your place
and ruined our plan.

31:04.237 --> 31:06.573
There's no such thing as coincidence.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.784
You really need to report him now.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.539
I'm not worried about him anymore.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.666
I'll explain later.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.169
We'd better not see each other
for a few days.

31:21.254 --> 31:22.505
I'll be at Tomás' place.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.842
Keep in touch and be careful.

31:26.509 --> 31:27.552
See you. Bye.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.472
These are the doctor's instructions.

32:13.514 --> 32:18.061
Hugo will take her vitals every morning
to see how she's doing.

32:18.645 --> 32:22.398
God will repay you
for helping our dear Alice, Inés.

32:23.024 --> 32:23.983
A hundredfold.

32:26.027 --> 32:26.861
Hugo.

32:32.533 --> 32:34.452
-Excuse me.
-Sister Consuelo.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.541
Thanks for helping us.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.251
My pleasure, Caridad.

32:42.961 --> 32:46.464
I knew it was God's will
for me to study nursing for a year

32:46.547 --> 32:48.466
before taking my vows.

32:48.549 --> 32:50.593
They say it's a matter of time

32:50.677 --> 32:53.763
for Alice to get rid of all the drugs
in her system.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.723
Dr. Zapata's report

32:56.265 --> 32:59.811
tells us what the problem is
and how to fix it.

32:59.894 --> 33:03.856
She'll be up and chatting in no time.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.201
It's a work in progress.

33:17.412 --> 33:21.124
Why would she block me on Instagram, dude?

33:25.378 --> 33:26.963
I said it's a work in progress.

33:28.923 --> 33:33.553
Sometimes I park in front of her place
and watch her window.

33:34.137 --> 33:35.096
You're kidding.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.682
There's nothing weird going on.

33:40.143 --> 33:43.479
-So why do it?
-I can't get her out of my head.

33:45.189 --> 33:49.402
Seriously, dude. I see her everywhere.
I need to know what happened.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.488
Maybe not knowing is better?

33:53.990 --> 33:57.535
Seriously, maybe she's terminal,

33:57.618 --> 34:00.663
or getting married, or whatever.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.458
Dude, forget about her.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.002
Take my advice.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.885
Thanks for being a good friend.

34:22.685 --> 34:24.520
The two girls haven't met?

34:24.604 --> 34:26.064
No, they live far apart,

34:26.147 --> 34:29.567
so unless it's by phone,
they haven't made any contact.

34:30.693 --> 34:31.903
Do I keep watching them?

34:33.404 --> 34:36.866
No, not anymore.
What about the lady doctor?

34:36.949 --> 34:40.495
She moved from the address you gave me.
Looks like she retired.

34:41.579 --> 34:44.123
Okay. No worries. Let's go.

34:56.094 --> 34:56.928
Yes?

34:57.011 --> 35:01.766
Dr. Salgado for you, sir.
She says it's urgent. It's her third call.

35:02.475 --> 35:04.560
I took Rosa to Dr. Salgado.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.605
Put her through.

35:20.576 --> 35:21.577
Yes?

35:21.661 --> 35:23.246
Mr. Marroquín.

35:23.329 --> 35:27.333
This is Dr. Salgado,
the gynecologist you contacted to…

35:27.416 --> 35:29.460
I know. What do you want?

35:29.544 --> 35:33.047
A woman claiming to be a reporter
came looking for me.

35:33.131 --> 35:37.260
She wants to know who paid
for Rosa Martínez's abortion.

35:37.343 --> 35:40.179
Maybe she asked
who's the moron you tricked?

35:40.263 --> 35:42.140
Then you know I didn't…

35:42.223 --> 35:46.727
Yes, I know I have a daughter out there
who should've never been born.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.480
But I forgot to thank you.

35:49.564 --> 35:53.943
Please, put yourself in my shoes.
Rosa swore no one would find out.

35:54.610 --> 35:57.488
She felt the baby, heard its heartbeats.

35:58.406 --> 36:02.451
So, now you want more money
to not sic the hounds on me?

36:02.535 --> 36:04.704
No, I denied everything.

36:04.787 --> 36:08.833
I said I knew nothing about it,
that it was another Dr. Salgado.

36:10.293 --> 36:14.505
But if this gets leaked,
I'll lose my license and maybe go to jail.

36:16.215 --> 36:19.635
I only called to make sure
you'll protect me.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.680
Like I protected you back then.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.434
I trust you will, sir.

36:39.614 --> 36:40.781
Thanks for doing this.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.214
Still mad at me?

36:58.424 --> 37:01.177
I'm not mad at you, Pocho, I'm worried.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.721
We owe the rent and lots of bills.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.564
I said I'd get another job and I will.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.776
Can I have a kiss?

37:35.503 --> 37:38.631
THE PLAN STILL STANDS
8 PM

37:44.762 --> 37:46.889
What, are you going solo?

37:48.099 --> 37:52.186
Yes, I had a little fight with Pocho
and I don't want to ditch you.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.397
You know singing helps me forget.

37:55.064 --> 37:58.234
Ask Claudio to upload the tracks
for your songs.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.112
Thanks. I'll start at 8:00, okay?

38:08.577 --> 38:09.829
He's not well, Víctor.

38:10.746 --> 38:13.582
He canceled four big meetings, won't eat.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.253
Should I call Catalina?

38:19.297 --> 38:20.965
You can go. I'll take care of it.

38:33.060 --> 38:35.563
She won't rest in peace.

38:35.646 --> 38:39.233
You laced my damn drink that evening
and raped me.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.987
A man forced her to abort.
That's why I'm here.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.698
An abortion, Simón?
I'm four months pregnant.

38:45.781 --> 38:47.575
The honorable Justice Minister

38:47.658 --> 38:51.329
screwed his sister-in-law
while his wife was pregnant.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.205
Guilt is a monster…

38:53.289 --> 38:54.123
Boss.

38:56.542 --> 38:57.585
You can go.

39:15.686 --> 39:19.065
Anonymous:
I can explain all this. Bar Fénix, 8 PM.

39:34.997 --> 39:36.248
Why is that bastard here?

39:41.170 --> 39:44.507
-He's looking for Matilde.
-No, he doesn't know she exists.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.593
It's no coincidence, Claudio.
What else can it be?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.181
Bravo!

39:59.105 --> 40:02.733
This is a very special evening

40:02.817 --> 40:06.153
because it's been 17 years

40:06.237 --> 40:09.407
