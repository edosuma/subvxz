Open it, Ollie, open it!

00:38.960 --> 00:41.160
[gasps] It's from my Auntie Char!

00:42.199 --> 00:45.680
Wow! She's working for a museum in Egypt.

00:45.839 --> 00:48.879
And she's searching for
an ancient pharaoh's treasure.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.040
A pharaoh? That's so cool!

00:51.199 --> 00:54.440
So awesome! So... What's a pharaoh?

00:54.599 --> 00:57.480
It's what they called a king
in Egypt a long time ago.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.120
Ooh! Fancy!
Has she found any treasure yet?

01:01.400 --> 01:03.199
Hmm. No.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.160
She says it's very tricky,
but she'll find it in the end.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.080
[gasps] Ollie, I am having a brainstorm!

01:10.240 --> 01:11.600
What if we went to Egypt

01:11.720 --> 01:13.840
to help your Auntie Char
find the treasure?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.360
But... how could we help her?

01:16.520 --> 01:18.960
Easy. I'm really good at finding things.

01:19.119 --> 01:20.800
I have a special gift for it.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.080
Here. Hide this marble
somewhere in your apartment.

01:25.640 --> 01:30.240
Anywhere.
I bet you I'll find it like that.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.240
Hmm.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.039
OK. I'll hide it.

01:36.199 --> 01:37.839
But you'll never find it.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.759
-What if I do?
-You won't.

01:41.199 --> 01:43.160
-But what if I do?
-But you won't.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.759
-But...
-OK.

01:45.839 --> 01:49.479
If you find it, which you won't,
we'll go to Egypt.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.160
But where I've hidden it,

01:51.320 --> 01:54.199
you're never, ever, ever going to...

01:54.360 --> 01:55.320
Found it!

01:55.479 --> 01:57.240
What? Oh!

01:57.600 --> 01:59.800
-But how?
-I told you.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.600
-I have a special gift.
-You must've gotten lucky.

02:02.759 --> 02:05.160
I say special, you say lucky.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.720
Either way...

02:06.880 --> 02:10.000
We're going to Egypt!
We're going to Egypt!

02:16.200 --> 02:17.200
Whoo!

02:18.359 --> 02:19.920
Whee!

02:27.720 --> 02:30.440
<i>Now arriving in Egypt.</i>

02:40.440 --> 02:42.799
Ollie, look! Pyramids!

02:45.519 --> 02:46.640
Cool!

02:49.120 --> 02:50.799
And there's Auntie Char!

02:50.920 --> 02:52.040
Hi, Auntie Char!

02:52.400 --> 02:53.799
Ollie! Moon!

02:55.120 --> 02:57.280
You couldn't have come at a better time.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.079
I just found a big clue

02:59.239 --> 03:02.280
to the pharaoh's treasure
of precious jewels!

03:02.600 --> 03:04.440
-[gasps] Wow!
-What is it?

03:04.600 --> 03:07.079
Ancient directions for finding it!

03:07.200 --> 03:08.519
Really? Then let's go!

03:08.679 --> 03:10.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:10.959 --> 03:14.079
I'm afraid it's not that easy, you two.

03:15.160 --> 03:19.160
The ancient Egyptians wrote
in pictures called hieroglyphics.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.840
Hi, ro-glyphics!

03:22.000 --> 03:24.040
And to understand the directions,

03:24.200 --> 03:27.280
we have to figure out
what the pictures mean!

03:27.720 --> 03:30.040
-Ooh! That looks hard.
-Can I try?

03:30.720 --> 03:33.280
I've got a special gift
for finding things,

03:33.440 --> 03:35.239
so I bet I can figure it out!

03:35.480 --> 03:39.000
Be my guest, Moon.
Here's a copy of the directions.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.239
We've already figured out the first bit.

03:41.399 --> 03:45.200
The treasure's in the valley
of the three pyramids.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.880
-Yes!
-Really?

03:47.040 --> 03:49.440
That took us all day to figure out!

03:49.600 --> 03:51.840
Moon, you're a natural!

03:55.200 --> 03:57.160
Madam, you're needed over at the museum.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.119
Excuse me, kids, I have to go.
But you keep at it, OK?

04:12.920 --> 04:13.880
See this, Ollie?

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
It says to find the treasure
we have to hop with our arms out

04:18.159 --> 04:22.599
until we find a pyramid entrance
marked by a funny duck.

04:22.719 --> 04:23.560
Uh-huh.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.280
Ollie, you have to hop
and put your arms out,

04:33.440 --> 04:34.840
otherwise we'll never find

04:35.000 --> 04:36.840
the pyramid entrance
with the funny duck.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.240
Hopping's not going to make
any difference.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.000
-What if it does?
-It won't.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.599
-But what if it does?
-But it won't.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.039
Whee!

04:47.200 --> 04:49.360
OK. I'll do it.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.960
But it's not going to help us find...

04:51.120 --> 04:53.000
-The funny duck!
-Seriously.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.120
Right at the entrance to this pyramid!

04:59.479 --> 05:00.880
I found it!

05:01.640 --> 05:05.000
You mean the picture
on the side of the bus?

05:05.159 --> 05:07.599
But, Moon, when they drew
these directions,

05:07.760 --> 05:10.560
buses hadn't even been invented yet!

05:10.919 --> 05:11.880
Moon?

05:13.360 --> 05:14.880
Now, let's see.

05:15.039 --> 05:18.479
We have to go inside
and find a red-headed dog.

05:18.599 --> 05:20.560
How'd I figure that out so fast?

05:20.719 --> 05:22.840
With my special gift!

05:23.320 --> 05:24.840
It's OK to be amazed.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.719
[sighs]

05:29.000 --> 05:31.640
Ollie, do you see a red-headed dog?

05:31.800 --> 05:33.120
I don't see anything, Moon!

05:34.200 --> 05:36.000
Guys? Is that you?

05:36.159 --> 05:37.640
-Scoot?
-Is that you?

05:38.520 --> 05:42.520
Ollie! Moon! Am I glad to run into you!

05:42.680 --> 05:44.760
Do you know how to get out of here?

05:45.159 --> 05:47.039
One wrong turn and boom!

05:47.200 --> 05:50.400
I'm lost inside a pyramid for three days!

05:50.560 --> 05:52.880
I'm really glad we found you, Scoot.

05:53.039 --> 05:56.800
Me too! Because we've just found
our red-headed dog!

05:56.960 --> 06:00.240
Ollie, look at Scoot's hat! It's red!

06:00.440 --> 06:01.800
What are you guys talking about?

06:02.520 --> 06:04.440
We've been searching for treasure.

06:04.599 --> 06:07.560
These hieroglyphics gave us
directions to the pyramid.

06:08.359 --> 06:10.640
And then the next step was to go inside

06:10.800 --> 06:13.760
and find a red-headed dog. You!

06:13.919 --> 06:17.159
-Well, that's just nuts!
-That's what I've been saying!

06:17.640 --> 06:22.479
What an amazing and special gift
you have, Moon!

06:23.159 --> 06:25.280
That's what I've been saying.

06:25.440 --> 06:28.280
I want to help!
What does it say to do next?

06:28.440 --> 06:31.280
It says we should... Hmm...

06:31.440 --> 06:35.240
find a giant lion that looks like me.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.440
But there's no way it could say that.

06:37.599 --> 06:41.200
Look! A lion, an eye and a Moon.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.840
A lion that looks like me!

06:44.400 --> 06:46.039
And there it is!

06:48.479 --> 06:49.640
[all] Wow!

06:51.280 --> 06:53.440
OK, yes, it's a giant lion,

06:53.599 --> 06:55.280
but it doesn't look at all like Moon!

06:55.680 --> 06:58.560
Wow! They're exactly the same!

07:00.280 --> 07:03.120
-Moon's just making a face!
-The face of an expert!

07:04.599 --> 07:05.840
Follow me!

07:09.520 --> 07:10.599
Hmm...

07:11.560 --> 07:13.239
This next bit is tough.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.200
Why don't I try this time? Hmm.

07:16.359 --> 07:19.719
OK. It says, "Over the next
sand dune, turn right."

07:19.880 --> 07:21.359
[laughter]

07:21.520 --> 07:23.400
What? It makes total sense!

07:23.560 --> 07:27.400
Oh, Ollie. It's OK.
Not everybody has the gift.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.320
This next bit actually says
we're supposed to ride a camel

07:32.479 --> 07:34.359
while holding up a...

07:35.080 --> 07:36.200
Flyswatter?

07:36.320 --> 07:38.599
Well, that makes
about as much sense as a...

07:38.719 --> 07:40.760
Yes! A flyswatter!

07:40.919 --> 07:43.239
Scoot, you can read hieroglyphics!

07:43.400 --> 07:45.400
You must have a special gift too!

07:45.520 --> 07:46.359
Ugh!

07:58.080 --> 08:00.840
[groans]

08:01.000 --> 08:02.320
Ugh!

08:03.039 --> 08:04.200
[grumbles]

08:04.359 --> 08:07.320
-Are we there yet?
-Let's see.

08:07.479 --> 08:10.840
We'll know we're there
when the bird shows us.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.320
[groans]

08:16.960 --> 08:19.000
Will that bird be bringing us lunch?

08:19.159 --> 08:20.039
Let me check!

08:20.200 --> 08:21.919
Hmm. No.

08:22.159 --> 08:24.239
Moon, are you sure this is right?

08:24.520 --> 08:28.200
I am super hot and thirsty
and I don't see...

08:28.359 --> 08:29.400
The bird!

08:32.559 --> 08:34.439
This must be where we dig!

08:35.240 --> 08:39.880
It happened exactly like I said.
See? I do have a special gift!

08:40.039 --> 08:42.039
And you can help me prove it!

08:42.679 --> 08:43.799
Come on!

08:45.439 --> 08:47.840
[groaning]

08:54.800 --> 08:56.400
[Scoot] Ooh, boy!

08:57.520 --> 08:58.840
I hate to say it, Moon,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.720
but I don't think
there's any treasure here.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.720
I can't believe it!
I was sure I had a special gift.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.720
I thought I was special, but I'm not.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.520
Of course you are, Moon!

09:09.680 --> 09:10.880
You're my best friend.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.880
You'll always be special to me.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.800
Oh, well. I'm just glad
we can stop digging!

-What a treasure!
-Yay!

an ancient set of his dinnerware.

Oh, I don't have a gift. I know that now.

But you do have a gift, Moon.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.240
A gift for fun!

10:28.400 --> 10:32.520
You have great brainstorms that
you drag everybody else into.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.560
That's what makes you special.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.959

I really hid it well this time!

You mean... this marble?

10:49.160 --> 10:52.400
But... I hid it here. How'd you do that?
