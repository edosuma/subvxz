00:02.920 --> 00:04.463
WOMAN (on TV): You can't just keep it
and not play anymore?

00:04.546 --> 00:05.547
MAN (on TV): No.

00:05.631 --> 00:06.924
<i>Explain that one.</i>

00:07.633 --> 00:09.343
<i>You always give a guy a second chance.</i>

00:09.426 --> 00:11.428
<i>That's like the golden rule of guys.</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:12.888
WOMAN: Then what's the problem?

00:12.971 --> 00:15.807
MAN: The problem is I can't let them know
I'm letting them win it back.

00:16.266 --> 00:18.644
<i>Look, Joanna, you can go ahead</i>
<i>and make fun of this,</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:20.229
<i>but this is real important to me.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:22.731
<i>I mean, I'm telling you what guys think,</i>

00:22.814 --> 00:25.484
<i>and if you want to be one of the guys,</i>
<i>you don't break the code.</i>

00:26.026 --> 00:27.611
WOMAN: It's hell being a guy,
isn't it, Dick?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.696
MAN: It's no picnic.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.657
(hinges creaking) (audience laughs)

00:41.917 --> 00:43.877
(clanking loudly)

01:03.438 --> 01:05.274
(thud)

01:49.443 --> 01:51.987
(screeching) (boy screaming)

01:52.696 --> 01:54.406
(hissing) (screaming)

01:54.489 --> 01:56.366
No, Thaddeus! Go away!

02:01.455 --> 02:02.956
(shushing)

02:03.540 --> 02:05.751
Tell me. What's your name?

02:06.627 --> 02:08.170
T...Tate.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.215
If Thaddeus comes back to scare you again,

02:11.757 --> 02:14.718
just shut your eyes and say, "Go away."

02:16.220 --> 02:17.638
You understand, Tate?

02:17.888 --> 02:20.849
He'll mind you
'cause I'm going to protect you.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.064
(whispers) I wish you were my mommy.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.565
Hmm.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.153
Now, dry your tears, child.

02:36.365 --> 02:39.034
Life is too short for so much sorrow.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.722
(Nora crying)

03:11.149 --> 03:12.651
Who are you?

03:13.068 --> 03:14.570
It's me, Tate.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.447
Life's too short for so much sorrow.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.366
You're wrong.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.869
It's an eternity.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.497
Just endless days and nights of longing.

03:25.581 --> 03:27.207
Where's my baby?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.962
That's what I want to talk to you about.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.131
You...you promised me.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.092
You made one with her,
the, the lady of the house.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.594
Vivien.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.220
That's Violet's mother.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.389
And I can't give you that baby anymore.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.016
Everything's changed, Nora.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.769
-I'm in love with Violet.
-I see.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.355
I just can't take her brother away.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.149
But I can.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.443
And I will.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.615
That baby is mine.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.620
<i>(♪♪♪)</i>

05:05.347 --> 05:08.308
Dad, I'm not a dog. I told you,
I don't feel well. Just leave me here.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.394
I don't trust you anymore,
and I don't trust Tate.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.937
Tate? I haven't seen him in weeks.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.773
No more, Violet. Your mom's coming home,
and you're coming with me to get her.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.359
-Dad, please, I don't feel well.
-You can lay down in the car.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.569
And when we get home, pack up your things.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.112
-We're leaving this house for good.
-What?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.239
-You guys are back together?
-I don't know yet.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.200
Your mom wants to go to Aunt Jo's
to give birth, and I'm supporting it.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.702
No, you don't want to do this.

05:26.785 --> 05:30.455
Violet, your mother's been locked up
in a psych ward for weeks.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.249
I won't let her stay there
for another minute.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.918
Are you gonna get in the car,
or do I have to make you?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.380
My God, Violet. What is wrong with you?

05:38.463 --> 05:40.883
Get in the car.
Your mother wants to see you.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.968
I'm gonna throw up.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.345
Fine. I'll lay down.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.514
(engine starts)

06:10.329 --> 06:12.039
What's gonna happen when they get back?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.166
What do I say?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.671
(typing)

06:20.756 --> 06:24.343
It's not U-tube with a "U."
It's YouTube. Y-O-U.

06:25.469 --> 06:26.470
Oh.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.890
If they find out I killed myself,
they'll go insane.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.684
Literally. For real this time.

06:32.768 --> 06:33.936
I mean, they can't know.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.021
Well, you can't control it forever.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.441
I mean, it is what it is, Violet.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.486
One of these days,
this computer will be obsolete.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.989
People will have microchips
implanted in their brains or something.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.700
We won't be able to watch YouTube
or anything.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.411
We'll be like all the others here.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.664
Prisoners in a windowless cell.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.750
Who's gonna show me
the new ways of the world?

06:57.668 --> 06:59.169
Nobody here is happy, Tate.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.879
Yeah, but they're not like us.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.340
They're lonely. We have each other.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.468
We'll never have kids.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.439
(birds chirping)

07:22.651 --> 07:25.320
I was so worried
when madam didn't have any potatoes,

07:25.404 --> 07:27.990
but I have to say these yams
are making a cleaner image.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.992
Less moisture, I think.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.286
Oh, I love that Chinese red.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.621
I always meant to use it
in the powder room downstairs.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.290
I'm gonna paint those old cribs too.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.458
Really? Red cribs?

07:38.542 --> 07:40.544
Uh, Chad?

07:42.087 --> 07:43.380
What did we talk about?

07:44.423 --> 07:45.924
(inhales)

07:46.008 --> 07:47.759
"Our" babies, not "my" babies.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.596
You know what? I can live with a red crib.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.806
It might actually be kind of fabulous.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.267
You are so adorable when you're happy.

07:55.350 --> 07:57.436
(chuckling) (door opens)

08:02.107 --> 08:03.734
Who asked you to decorate the nursery?

08:03.817 --> 08:06.111
Let me break it down for you, sweetheart.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.865
This is our house, and we're having twins.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.659
Who's your surrogate?
One of those nurses in the basement?

08:12.743 --> 08:15.537
No. No.

08:16.622 --> 08:20.167
A very, very human surrogate, Elvira.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.961
Your lovely mother.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.756
You think you're gonna steal those twins?

08:26.590 --> 08:30.511
You pathetic homos couldn't steal
the shit out of your own ass.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.429
(chuckling)

08:32.513 --> 08:35.140
You know what? It doesn't matter.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.518
As soon as my parents get back,
we're leaving here.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.394
They're leaving.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.563
So knock yourselves out.

08:41.647 --> 08:45.526
Honey, your parents aren't going anywhere
as long as you're stuck here.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.361
And don't you get all snotty,
little sister.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.612
You'll be begging to babysit.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.989
As big as this place is,
it does get very, very lonely.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.616
It could get ugly though.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.369
Were you a C-section?

08:55.744 --> 08:58.121
Is there an existing zipper we might use?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.831
Watch it, you Goddamn queen.

08:59.915 --> 09:03.627
Oh, I am quaking in my loafers.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.128
What are you gonna do?

09:07.297 --> 09:08.382
Murder me?

09:20.435 --> 09:21.520
(door opens)

09:21.603 --> 09:24.231
My brown betty turns
to black betty in 20 minutes.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.942
So tell me what this is all about.

09:28.277 --> 09:29.403
I need help.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.071
Do you remember those two guys
that lived here before us?

09:31.154 --> 09:33.407
(chuckles) Frick and frack?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.492
How could I forget?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.161
Well, they're upstairs, and they're
planning to kidnap my mother's babies...

09:38.245 --> 09:39.288
And raise them themselves.

09:42.541 --> 09:46.336
Well, let me assure you,
that is never going to happen.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.422
My mom's on her way back
from the hospital today.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.966
And I don't trust them.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.802
I called 'cause I want to talk to
that woman. The Craigslist psychic.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.847
Billie Dean? About what?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.308
Getting rid of ghosts.
There must be a way.

10:00.434 --> 10:03.020
(sighs) Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.774
Chad? Chad?

10:08.483 --> 10:11.111
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.573
(music box tinkling)

10:23.457 --> 10:25.125
Put your skanky claw on that crib,

10:25.209 --> 10:27.044
you'll be pulling away a bloody stump.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.506
Where did you find these things?

10:30.589 --> 10:31.757
Around.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.177
You'd be amazed
at the little forgotten treasures

10:35.260 --> 10:37.429
left behind by previous occupants.

10:37.513 --> 10:40.974
What you are planning to do is unnatural.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.728
Deodorant's unnatural,
but it's a public good.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.189
We'll make excellent parents.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.233
Man shall not lie with man.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.485
It is an abomination.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.197
So's that hairdo,
but I figure that's your business.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.283
Why can't you people
just content yourself with having pets?

10:59.034 --> 11:03.205
Why must you subject
an innocent child to your perversions?

11:03.288 --> 11:05.040
There's nothing in the studies
that indicates

11:05.123 --> 11:06.875
being raised by a same-sex couple

11:06.959 --> 11:08.669
has any ill effects on children.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.004
I assume the same applies
to the formerly living.

11:11.088 --> 11:14.132
Well, the only study I know
is the study of blood and pain.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.968
My children came out of my body,

11:16.051 --> 11:19.012
and that is something that
you will never be able to understand.

11:19.096 --> 11:21.598
(chuckles) Lady...

11:22.391 --> 11:25.477
Just because you happen to be
the hole they crawled out of

11:25.561 --> 11:27.104
doesn't mean a Goddamn thing.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.188
It means everything.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.399
Right. Sure.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.317
That's why I can't even
walk through my own home

11:32.401 --> 11:34.361
without tripping over
one of your dead offspring.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.489
I loved my children.

11:37.573 --> 11:38.866
To death.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.701
They are a part of me,

11:40.784 --> 11:44.079
just like that unborn child
is a part of me,

11:44.162 --> 11:47.833
and I will not have you put your
filthy hands on my grandchild.

11:50.502 --> 11:51.837
Grandchild?

11:52.296 --> 11:53.630
Wait a minute.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.093
Are you telling me that Norman Bates Jr.
Is the baby daddy?

11:58.802 --> 12:02.389
(chuckling) You gotta love this house.

12:02.848 --> 12:05.559
Listen to me. You can have the other one.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.352
The one fathered by Dr. Harmon.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.062
I mean, he's an attractive man.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.441
But not my grandbaby.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.818
A blond and a brunet,
just like me and Pat.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.153
It's perfect.

12:18.614 --> 12:19.656
No.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.492
We definitely need both.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.162
God, you're vile.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.832
You're not suited to raise children.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.542
Raise them?

12:30.626 --> 12:32.711
Oh, honey, no, no, no.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.714
We're going to wait till they reach
that perfect, adorable age,

12:35.797 --> 12:37.925
around a year, year and a half or so...

12:38.842 --> 12:41.512
And then we're going to smother them
with hypoallergenic pillows.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.765
That way, they'll be cute forever.

12:48.352 --> 12:50.020
(music box tinkling)

13:03.033 --> 13:05.077
BILLIE: <i>So much pain here.</i>

13:08.497 --> 13:11.750
So much longing and regret.

13:14.878 --> 13:15.963
<i>Fear.</i>

13:17.297 --> 13:18.549
Sadness.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.094
<i>Guilt.</i>

13:22.928 --> 13:24.471
And perversion.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.141
Now, can you ferret out
the fairies for us?

13:28.809 --> 13:32.145
I mean,
that's our main concern at the moment.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.858
Targeting a particular spirit
is going to be difficult.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.777
This is a very crowded house.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.322
BILLIE: <i>You were so</i><i>young. I'm so sorry.</i>

13:42.865 --> 13:43.991
<i>Oh, God.</i>

13:44.324 --> 13:46.702
<i>Please don't tell.</i><i>They can't know.</i>

13:46.785 --> 13:48.370
So what can we do?

13:48.453 --> 13:51.290
Somehow, we have to try and dislodge them

13:51.373 --> 13:54.543
from the paramagnetic grip of this place.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.295
The what?

13:57.004 --> 13:58.297
The evil.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.884
It's a force just like any other, Violet.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.469
<i>Pure physics.</i>

14:04.553 --> 14:08.473
Real and powerful. Created by events.

14:08.557 --> 14:13.353
Events that unleash psychic energy into
the environment, where it's absorbed.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.690
Like the way a battery stores energy.

14:17.858 --> 14:22.863
You'll see it all the time in places
like prisons or asylums.

14:22.946 --> 14:27.159
Negative energy feeds on trauma and pain.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.078
It draws those things to it.

14:30.996 --> 14:36.543
The force here in this house is
larger than the many individual traumas.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.296
And it has a need.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.965
It wants to break through.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.718
It wants to move in our world.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.512
It's using those trapped

14:46.595 --> 14:49.681
between this world
and the next as conduits.

14:50.140 --> 14:52.351
(sighs) That's very interesting.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.187
But what do we do about the gays?

14:55.270 --> 14:56.605
I mean, how do we get rid of them?

14:56.688 --> 14:58.315
Oh, there might be a way.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.983
I can't promise.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.238
(sternly) He can't be here.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.532
Tate.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.368
Billie Dean, that's my boy.

15:12.538 --> 15:13.914
That's Tate.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.209
-I want to help.
-You've helped enough.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.379
Not now, Tate. Go on.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.763
-What was that about?
-(chuckling)

15:30.889 --> 15:35.769
It's just that, sometimes,
when a medium meets a spirit so directly,

15:35.853 --> 15:38.272
it has a powerful effect, that's all.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.274
It's nothing to concern yourself about.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.359
Okay, so what can we do?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.905
VIVIEN: <i>Why</i><i>didn't Violet come?</i>

15:47.781 --> 15:50.659
BEN: <i>Violet's been having</i>
<i>a very rough time.</i>

15:50.742 --> 15:52.286
She didn't come visit me once, Ben.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.832
I'm Dr. Marchesi, the resident physician.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.627
-How are you, Vivien?
-Fine. Ready to go home.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.338
Have you had any luck
convincing your wife to...

16:03.422 --> 16:05.048
Push off the trip until after the birth?

16:05.132 --> 16:09.303
Dr. Marchesi is recommending bed rest
because of the twins,

16:09.386 --> 16:11.513
which I wholeheartedly agree with.

16:11.597 --> 16:14.141
And I said to him that we would get
a wheelchair at the airport.

16:14.224 --> 16:16.393
I will be sitting
the whole way to Florida.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.936
I'm only six months pregnant,

16:18.020 --> 16:19.771
so it's still okay to travel.
I 'll be fine.

16:19.855 --> 16:22.274
Well, wheelchairs are all well and good,

16:22.357 --> 16:24.193
but as I told your wife,

16:24.276 --> 16:26.278
I wouldn't be surprised
if your obstetrician

16:26.361 --> 16:28.906
didn't recommend an immediate
emergency C-section.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.200
Well, in 24 hours,
I will be in the capable hands

16:31.283 --> 16:34.620
of my sister and her family
and an excellent obstetrician.

16:34.703 --> 16:39.750
I'll be with people
who I trust and out of this city.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.628
Thank you for bringing these.
I'll bring them to the doctor.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.713
I'd like to hear it from the doctor.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.715
Emergency C-section?

16:46.798 --> 16:49.968
I'm sure you're aware
that these babies, well,

16:50.052 --> 16:51.220
rather, one of these babies,

16:51.303 --> 16:53.263
has been developing at a rapid rate.

16:54.556 --> 16:58.268
I mean, to the point where he's ready
to come out and live on his own.

16:58.352 --> 16:59.978
And the other one
seems to be getting weaker.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.106
Sometimes referred to
as intrauterine omophagia.

17:03.190 --> 17:07.194
All the necessary nutrients
are being devoured by the larger fetus.

17:07.736 --> 17:08.987
The alpha, if you will.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.156
When were you gonna tell me this, Vivien?

17:11.240 --> 17:13.325
We will address it all
when we get to Florida.

17:13.408 --> 17:15.285
Well, I'm on record.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.247
It was nice to meet you,
Dr. Harmon, Vivien.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.750
If I were you,
I would start checking to see

17:21.834 --> 17:24.127
if there's a medical doctor
on that flight.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.050
Let's go.

17:34.721 --> 17:38.141
It's difficult to banish a spirit
but not impossible.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.645
The most successful attempt
that I know of happened

17:41.728 --> 17:43.856
when America was known as the New World.

17:43.939 --> 17:46.316
Are you kidding?
That's, like, 500 years ago.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.777
Spirits do not follow our physical laws.

17:49.194 --> 17:50.946
Nor are they affected by time.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.656
About the only thing they have in common

17:52.739 --> 17:54.616
with the living is their suffering.

17:55.325 --> 17:56.493
Regret.

17:57.077 --> 17:58.078
Pain.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.038
Loneliness.

18:01.164 --> 18:05.460
In 1590, on the coast of what we now know
as North Carolina,

18:06.044 --> 18:10.799
<i>the entire colony of</i><i>Roanoke, all 117 men,</i>

18:10.883 --> 18:13.927
<i>women and children,</i><i>died inexplicably.</i>

18:14.720 --> 18:16.680
It became known as the ghost colony

18:16.763 --> 18:18.849
because the spirits remained.

18:18.932 --> 18:23.020
<i>They haunted the native tribes</i>
<i>living in the surrounding area,</i>

18:23.478 --> 18:25.647
<i>killing indiscriminately.</i>

18:30.360 --> 18:32.529
BILLIE: <i>The elder</i><i>knew he had to act.</i>

18:32.613 --> 18:34.990
He cast a banishment curse.

18:35.532 --> 18:40.287
<i>First, he collected the personal</i>
<i>belongings of all the dead colonists.</i>

18:40.787 --> 18:42.414
<i>Then they burned them.</i>

18:42.497 --> 18:46.460
<i>The ghosts appeared,</i>
<i>summoned by their talismans,</i>

18:46.543 --> 18:50.088
<i>but before the spirits could cause them</i>
<i>any more harm,</i>

18:50.631 --> 18:54.760
<i>the elder completed the curse</i>
<i>that would banish the ghosts forever.</i>

18:55.928 --> 18:58.514
-VIOLET: <i>How?</i>
-BILLIE: <i>By uttering a single word.</i>

18:59.348 --> 19:03.560
<i>The same word found carved on a post</i>
<i>at the abandoned colony.</i>

19:04.228 --> 19:05.437
Croatoan!

19:05.521 --> 19:07.147
Croatoan.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.734
So now you know what you have to do.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.791
What'd she say?

19:25.874 --> 19:27.918
We have to get something of his.
Something important.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.879
An heirloom or a ring. Like a talisman.

19:32.673 --> 19:35.926
If we have the talisman and
we do this special ritual, he'll be gone.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.511
That sounds like bullshit.

19:37.803 --> 19:39.638
Billie Dean's for real.
She studies this stuff.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.682
The bigger guy wears,
like, a wedding ring,

19:41.765 --> 19:43.016
but I can't remember which hand it's on.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.977
I don't trust her.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.312
And why'd she say all that stuff about me?

19:48.105 --> 19:50.440
I did something bad, didn't I?

19:51.984 --> 19:53.652
Let's just get the ring.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.533
How does it work?

19:59.783 --> 20:03.161
Will the kid call you both Daddy,
or is one of you the Mom?

20:04.955 --> 20:05.956
I'm just messing with you.

20:06.874 --> 20:10.085
Seriously, though,
are you ready for all this?

20:11.336 --> 20:14.840
I mean, you never struck me as the diapers
and midnight feedings type.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.800
Maybe you should have taken
a few minutes to get to know me

20:16.884 --> 20:19.094
before you stuck a fireplace poker
up my ass.

20:20.512 --> 20:21.722
Fair enough.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.348
<i>Look...</i>

20:24.433 --> 20:26.268
We're all going to be here
for a long time,

20:26.351 --> 20:30.147
so maybe we can figure out a way
to let bygones be bygones...

20:30.230 --> 20:32.941
And, you know... Cohabitate.

20:33.025 --> 20:35.235
I'm <i>dead</i> because of you!

20:35.319 --> 20:37.529
Well, there's got to be something
I could offer you.

20:38.322 --> 20:41.283
I mean, just because we're dead
doesn't mean we don't have wants.

20:43.452 --> 20:44.703
Desires.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.750
Marriage looks hard.

20:50.834 --> 20:52.211
Especially to that guy.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.296
Always on you all the time.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.049
And never in the ways you want, right?

20:58.217 --> 21:02.262
It must suck to have to wait
till Halloween every year

21:03.555 --> 21:05.140
to get a little strange.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.902
I can't kill you,
but I can make you suffer.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.820
(thud)

21:18.904 --> 21:20.614
Best part is, when I'm done,
you'll heal up,

21:20.697 --> 21:23.534
and I can beat the shit out of you
all over again.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.537
Harder. I like it rough.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.288
-Not supposed to be like this.
-(groans)

21:28.372 --> 21:30.040
I'm not supposed to be here!

21:30.123 --> 21:31.542
(thud)

21:31.625 --> 21:32.626
Look at me. Look at me.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.169
I was gonna get out!

21:39.716 --> 21:43.011
I fell in love. God help me.
I was gonna get out and be with him,

21:43.095 --> 21:46.723
and then you killed me,
and now I'm stuck here with him!

21:49.226 --> 21:50.227
Chad.

22:04.199 --> 22:05.242
I won't go in the house.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.911
You don't have to. I packed your things.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.873
-Is Violet packed?
-I told her we're leaving.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.917
You okay?

22:35.105 --> 22:37.691
(groaning)

22:41.904 --> 22:44.740
(moaning)

22:50.829 --> 22:52.706
(shouts)

22:58.670 --> 22:59.838
What'd you get?

23:00.506 --> 23:01.548
He took it off to paint.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.300
Why does a ghost need a watch?

23:03.383 --> 23:07.095
BEN: <i>Violet!</i><i>Violet!</i>

23:08.055 --> 23:09.973
<i>You disappeared on me.</i>
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

23:10.057 --> 23:11.350
(pounding on the door)

23:11.433 --> 23:12.893
<i>Violet, your mom's</i><i>waiting in the car.</i>

23:12.976 --> 23:14.645
<i>We have a plane</i><i>to catch.</i>

23:14.728 --> 23:16.897
Good. Go far away.

23:17.606 --> 23:18.815
Just don't bring Mom in the house.

23:18.899 --> 23:20.067
What are you talking about?
You're coming with us.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.276
No!

23:21.777 --> 23:23.111
I can take care of myself.

23:23.195 --> 23:24.988
If you want to,
you can come back for me later.

23:25.072 --> 23:27.407
But for right now, you have to trust me
and get the hell out of here.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.493
And tell Mom I love her
and good luck with the babies.

23:29.576 --> 23:31.119
What's the matter with you? Huh?

23:32.204 --> 23:34.248
-Are you high or something?
-I wish.

23:34.331 --> 23:36.124
Violet, I stopped at a red light,
and you were gone.

23:36.208 --> 23:38.710
-Where did you go?
-Nowhere. I was right here.

23:39.545 --> 23:41.505
I wanted to come. I swear.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.756
I couldn't leave the house.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.467
Stop it! You're lying.
You're on drugs, I can tell.

23:45.551 --> 23:47.803
Tell me what kind, right now. Tell me!

23:49.471 --> 23:50.514
I'm dead!

23:51.306 --> 23:52.850
Don't you get it?

23:53.433 --> 23:56.186
Once you die in this house,
you don't get to leave.

23:56.812 --> 23:59.940
That's why you need to
take Mom somewhere safe.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.024
(car horn honks)

24:01.108 --> 24:02.693
-That's exactly what I'm gonna do.
-VIVIEN: <i>Ben!</i>

24:02.776 --> 24:04.570
You're coming with me.

24:05.821 --> 24:08.448
(Vivien screaming)

24:11.952 --> 24:13.120
Vivien.

24:13.829 --> 24:15.455
Oh, Vivien, Is the baby coming?

24:15.539 --> 24:18.625
No. No, it's too soon.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.086
No, no, no. No, honey.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.506
When a child is ready to be born,
there's no stopping it.

24:24.590 --> 24:25.716
No.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.467
-We got to get you to the house.
-No!

24:28.802 --> 24:30.596
I took some pills.

24:30.679 --> 24:32.014
I didn't mean to kill myself.

24:32.097 --> 24:35.684
VIVIEN: <i>Ben!</i> (groaning)

24:38.729 --> 24:41.481
-BEN: <i>What's wrong?</i>
-The babies are coming.

24:41.565 --> 24:43.734
No. No. (screams)

24:43.859 --> 24:44.860
VIVIEN: <i>No!</i>

24:50.032 --> 24:52.576
(groaning)

24:53.577 --> 24:55.662
Take it easy, now.
Don't forget to breathe.

24:55.746 --> 24:57.956
-Breathe.
-I can't get any service.

24:58.624 --> 25:00.375
I got to go to the hospital.

25:00.459 --> 25:02.252
It's too late for that.
You're already crowning.

25:02.336 --> 25:04.379
I'm gonna call Dr. Hall.
We'll get you an ambulance right away.

25:04.463 --> 25:06.548
Breathe, Vivien, breathe.

25:06.632 --> 25:07.925
Oh, God. It hurts.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.760
Well, of course it does, honey.
That's a woman's curse.

25:09.843 --> 25:13.347
(groaning) (panting)

25:16.141 --> 25:18.060
She can't give birth here. It's not safe.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.229
Well, then make it safe.
You know what to do.

25:20.312 --> 25:22.272
(beeping)

25:22.397 --> 25:23.732
Damn it!

25:26.818 --> 25:28.362
(busy signal)

25:29.655 --> 25:30.739
Shit!

25:33.408 --> 25:35.619
(shouting, laughing) (glass shattering)

25:36.119 --> 25:38.789
Hey! Get away from there!

25:38.872 --> 25:40.874
You kids get away from there!

25:43.836 --> 25:45.712
(house powering down)

25:57.224 --> 25:58.559
Dr. Harmon.

26:01.812 --> 26:03.230
It's time.

26:09.278 --> 26:10.863
(Vivien screaming)

26:10.946 --> 26:12.573
CHARLES: <i>Nurse, bring</i><i>me my doctor bag.</i>

26:12.656 --> 26:14.199
BEN: <i>This is wrong.</i>

26:14.283 --> 26:16.493
<i>Find me the 12-gauge scalpel.</i>

26:18.203 --> 26:19.997
BEN: <i>We have to get</i><i>her out of here.</i>

26:20.080 --> 26:21.582
(screaming)

26:22.624 --> 26:24.001
CHARLES: <i>Where</i><i>are those towels?</i>

26:24.084 --> 26:26.545
Spread them out underneath her.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.505
(Vivien screaming)

26:35.012 --> 26:36.388
<i>This house.</i>

26:36.471 --> 26:38.265
(screaming)

26:39.725 --> 26:41.268
VIVIEN: <i>Ben?</i>

26:41.727 --> 26:43.520
Wake up. This house is trying to help.

26:43.604 --> 26:46.481
And, right now,
you are in no position to refuse.

26:46.565 --> 26:47.691
Your wife needs you.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.943
So you better pull yourself together
and get in there.

26:50.027 --> 26:51.403
For her.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.071
VIVIEN: <i>Ben?</i>

26:54.239 --> 26:55.699
(screams)

27:00.746 --> 27:01.788
(whispers) Who are all these people?

27:01.872 --> 27:04.458
(Ben shouting) <i>Who are these people?</i>

27:05.083 --> 27:08.086
It's okay, baby. They're here to help us.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.756
I forgot how painful this is.

27:10.839 --> 27:12.216
(groaning)

27:12.633 --> 27:14.009
(whispers) Do you have a little something?

27:14.676 --> 27:15.886
Ether.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.763
CONSTANCE: <i>Just</i><i>to take the edge off.</i>

27:19.181 --> 27:20.432
VIVIEN: <i>Ah!</i>

27:20.516 --> 27:22.726
(panting)

27:31.360 --> 27:32.444
Help. (whimpers)

27:34.112 --> 27:35.447
(groans)

27:36.156 --> 27:37.866
Oh, I feel another one coming.

27:38.909 --> 27:40.911
Okay, honey, remember your breathing.

27:40.994 --> 27:43.413
(screaming)

27:45.207 --> 27:47.042
BEN: <i>You're doing great.</i>
<i>You're doing great.</i>

27:47.125 --> 27:49.044
<i>Just hang in there, honey.</i>
<i>You're doing great.</i>

27:49.127 --> 27:50.504
(screaming)

27:51.004 --> 27:52.714
CHARLES: <i>Here we go.</i><i>One more push.</i>

27:58.470 --> 28:01.390
(exhaling)

28:03.058 --> 28:05.978
Just breathe, honey. Breathe.
Remember your breathing.

28:10.607 --> 28:11.608
Breathe.

28:11.692 --> 28:14.319
-I hate you.
-I love you.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.530
DOCTOR: <i>Push, push, push.</i>

28:17.239 --> 28:19.616
(screaming)

28:20.242 --> 28:22.160
Here we go. One more push.

28:22.244 --> 28:23.662
One more big push.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.748
Here she comes. Come on, honey, push.
Come on. Push. Push.

28:26.832 --> 28:28.041
God, I love you.

28:31.128 --> 28:32.796
Breathe.

28:33.088 --> 28:34.590
I never wanted to lose you.

28:35.007 --> 28:36.175
You never will.

28:36.258 --> 28:38.302
WOMAN: <i>She's coming.</i><i>Here she comes.</i>

28:38.385 --> 28:41.430
Push. Push. Come on, honey.

28:41.555 --> 28:43.432
-(groans)
-Push!

28:43.849 --> 28:45.851
(baby crying)

28:45.934 --> 28:47.186
<i>It's a healthy baby girl.</i>

28:47.269 --> 28:48.478
Daddy, you want to cut the cord?

28:48.562 --> 28:50.147
Oh, yeah.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.065
Right there. Cut there.

28:52.149 --> 28:54.318
-There you go.
-Oh, my God.

28:55.277 --> 28:56.445
Oh, my God.

28:56.528 --> 28:57.863
VIVIEN: <i>Violet.</i>

29:03.869 --> 29:05.412
Your baby is stillborn.

29:12.127 --> 29:13.712
Is it a boy or a girl?

29:17.883 --> 29:19.259
Can I hold it?

29:22.137 --> 29:24.515
No. Not just yet, sweetheart.

29:25.933 --> 29:27.476
You've got another one coming.

29:29.061 --> 29:31.188
(screaming)

29:38.153 --> 29:40.113
(Vivien screaming)

29:51.333 --> 29:53.293
CHAD: <i>What exactly do you think</i>
<i>you're doing, young lady?</i>

29:53.377 --> 29:56.547
Is that my $12,000 watch
that you're putting into the furnace?

29:56.630 --> 29:58.048
Croatoan.

29:59.216 --> 30:02.636
Croatoan! Croatoan!

30:03.887 --> 30:05.097
(clattering)

30:05.180 --> 30:06.473
(gagging)

30:10.853 --> 30:12.396
(laughing)

30:13.355 --> 30:14.648
Just kidding.

30:16.733 --> 30:19.111
Ahh. So where'd you get that one?

30:19.236 --> 30:21.071
That press-on nail psychic
who was here earlier?

30:21.154 --> 30:23.824
I mean, really? The Roanoke spell?

30:24.783 --> 30:26.827
Please, tell me you'll be slitting
the throat of a chicken next

30:26.910 --> 30:29.413
because I've always found
that very dramatic.

30:29.496 --> 30:34.042
I also quite enjoy the burning of the sage
to rid the house of spirits.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.503
-It didn't work.
-Of course it didn't work.

30:36.587 --> 30:38.714
It's bullshit. It's all bullshit.

30:38.797 --> 30:40.174
People make up these spells

30:40.257 --> 30:43.635
and chants in order to feel
like they're in control.

30:43.719 --> 30:45.137
Well, guess what?

30:45.220 --> 30:46.680
They're not.

30:47.472 --> 30:49.099
Never have been.

30:50.601 --> 30:51.852
What are you doing?

30:51.935 --> 30:53.812
My own bullshit ritual.

30:54.188 --> 30:56.148
There's not gonna be any nursery.

30:59.193 --> 31:01.195
(sighs) We're not gonna be parents.

31:02.487 --> 31:04.489
Your mother's babies are safe.

31:05.657 --> 31:07.367
From us, at least.

31:07.451 --> 31:10.120
I'm doomed to spend eternity with a man

31:10.579 --> 31:11.997
who doesn't love me.

31:12.748 --> 31:14.041
Of course, it could be worse.

31:15.167 --> 31:16.877
Your man does love you,

31:18.378 --> 31:20.339
but he'll always be a monster.

31:20.422 --> 31:22.549
You're wrong. Tate's changed.

31:22.633 --> 31:24.092
He doesn't even remember what he did.

31:24.176 --> 31:26.428
Oh. When did he change?

31:27.387 --> 31:29.181
When he murdered me?

31:29.640 --> 31:31.308
When he murdered my boyfriend?

31:31.391 --> 31:33.143
(Vivien groaning)

31:33.227 --> 31:34.895
Or did he change...

31:35.687 --> 31:37.314
When he raped your mother?

31:37.898 --> 31:38.982
What?

31:40.609 --> 31:41.944
No, that's a lie.

31:42.027 --> 31:43.195
Is it?

31:43.278 --> 31:44.947
(Vivien screaming)

31:45.239 --> 31:46.949
I think you're about to find out.

31:48.283 --> 31:50.035
(Vivien screaming)

31:56.542 --> 31:58.210
(screaming)

31:58.710 --> 32:00.754
BEN: <i>Vivien, breathe.</i><i>You have to breathe.</i>

32:00.838 --> 32:03.298
Vivien, breathe. You have to breathe.

32:03.382 --> 32:04.967
I need forceps, now.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.844
-What's happening?
-It's dystocia.

32:06.927 --> 32:09.388
I have to manipulate the baby
through the pubic symphysis.

32:10.222 --> 32:13.267
(crying) I can't, Ben. I can't do it.

32:13.725 --> 32:15.519
-BEN: <i>I promise you. Look at me.</i>
-I can't.

32:15.602 --> 32:16.979
You can do this.

32:17.062 --> 32:18.438
(groaning)

32:18.522 --> 32:21.024
Dr. Harmon, have your wife
stop pushing until I say so.

32:21.108 --> 32:22.442
Vivien, can you hear me?

32:22.526 --> 32:23.902
You have to stop pushing...

32:23.986 --> 32:25.904
(screaming)

32:30.993 --> 32:33.245
Squeeze my hand as hard as you can.

32:33.495 --> 32:34.746
Squeeze!

32:35.038 --> 32:36.957
Get the gauze ready to stop the bleeding.

32:37.416 --> 32:38.542
Now, Dr. Harmon.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.961
Push, Vivien. You have to push. Push.

32:41.044 --> 32:42.796
-Push!
-(groaning)

32:42.880 --> 32:44.339
-Push!
-He's coming.

32:44.715 --> 32:46.592
(screaming)

32:46.800 --> 32:49.553
-You're doing great, Viv.
-Oh, God, it's ripping me apart!

32:49.636 --> 32:52.764
Don't stop, angel. The end is in sight.
I can see him.

32:52.848 --> 32:54.808
(screaming echoes)

32:54.892 --> 32:56.894
<i>(heart beating)</i>

32:56.977 --> 32:58.729
(inaudible)

33:05.068 --> 33:06.445
(screaming resumes)

33:06.528 --> 33:08.155
(baby crying)

33:08.238 --> 33:12.326
You did it, babe.
Honey, you did it. You did it.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.995
(baby crying)

33:19.208 --> 33:21.376
(moaning)

33:25.172 --> 33:27.257
-Is everything all right?
-She's bleeding.

33:27.341 --> 33:29.426
-I have to stop the bleeding.
-Cut the cord.

33:29.510 --> 33:31.512
It's time to separate mother and son.

33:33.138 --> 33:34.348
Can I see the baby?

33:34.765 --> 33:36.183
Hand him to me.

33:40.020 --> 33:41.980
I'll get him washed up.
I'll bring him right back.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.328
(surgical instruments clicking)

33:58.497 --> 34:00.499
Doctor, is everything all right?

34:09.591 --> 34:12.886
(Constance humming)

34:23.480 --> 34:25.107
(sobbing)

34:29.653 --> 34:31.154
What is the matter with you?

34:32.239 --> 34:35.117
He's the most beautiful baby
I've ever seen.

34:38.161 --> 34:40.539
From blood and pain come perfection.

34:42.791 --> 34:44.126
HAYDEN: <i>Hey, bitches.</i>

34:44.793 --> 34:46.920
You get all that slime off my baby yet?

34:48.839 --> 34:50.382
Nurse, I need pressure on this.

34:50.465 --> 34:51.967
What the hell is going on?

34:52.050 --> 34:55.012
She's going into shock.
I can't stop the hemorrhaging.

34:55.095 --> 34:56.889
Vivien, stay with me.

34:57.556 --> 34:58.724
<i>Vivien.</i>

34:59.349 --> 35:00.350
Mom.

35:01.852 --> 35:03.061
Violet.

35:04.062 --> 35:06.607
I'm sorry
I didn't go see you at the hospital.

35:07.816 --> 35:10.360
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

35:12.029 --> 35:13.906
You're here now. That's all that matters.

35:14.823 --> 35:15.991
Vivien.

35:16.450 --> 35:17.910
Listen to me.

35:19.244 --> 35:21.663
Concentrate on my words.

35:23.165 --> 35:25.042
We can be happy, honey.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.462
Just like we were before.

35:28.545 --> 35:31.924
Before my mistakes. Before this house.

35:32.799 --> 35:34.134
VIOLET: <i>It's okay, Mom.</i>

35:35.636 --> 35:38.555
If you're in pain, let go.

35:42.601 --> 35:44.853
I don't think I have a choice.

35:45.604 --> 35:46.939
BEN: <i>Hold on, Vivien.</i>

35:48.106 --> 35:49.566
Stay with me.

35:49.858 --> 35:51.193
VIOLET: <i>Come to this side.</i>

35:52.528 --> 35:55.197
<i>Let go.</i><i>You can be with me.</i>

35:55.822 --> 35:57.032
BEN: <i>Don't die.</i>

35:58.575 --> 36:00.577
<i>Don't die on me, Vivien.</i>

36:01.286 --> 36:03.997
<i>We can still have</i><i>a life together.</i>

36:06.291 --> 36:08.460
<i>We can still be happy.</i>

37:03.599 --> 37:05.142
My mom is dead.

37:10.939 --> 37:13.400
I'm so sorry. I know you were close.

37:14.109 --> 37:15.110
Yeah.

37:16.612 --> 37:17.821
We were.

37:19.740 --> 37:21.450
My dad's down there all alone now.

37:25.204 --> 37:28.582
That makes me sad. I like your dad.

37:28.665 --> 37:29.958
He was nice to me.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.418
He's nice to all his patients.

37:32.503 --> 37:34.254
-Even the ones who lie to him.
-What?

37:34.338 --> 37:36.298
Why did you start seeing him
in the first place?

37:37.090 --> 37:38.634
Constance thought you needed help.

37:38.717 --> 37:40.427
I did. I do.

37:40.844 --> 37:42.429
You knew you were dead.

37:45.015 --> 37:46.141
Yeah.

37:48.727 --> 37:49.978
Do you know why?

37:50.062 --> 37:51.688
The cops shot me.

37:53.524 --> 37:55.025
Right here in this room.

37:55.108 --> 37:57.736
Why? Why did they shoot you?

38:01.323 --> 38:02.783
I don't know.

38:06.245 --> 38:08.288
You murdered people, Tate.

38:08.914 --> 38:11.083
Kids. Like us.

38:12.334 --> 38:14.336
The kids that came to us on Halloween.

38:16.171 --> 38:17.673
Why would I do that?

38:18.799 --> 38:20.551
Why would I do that?

38:20.634 --> 38:22.803
(sobs) Why would I do that?

38:24.096 --> 38:25.180
<i>No.</i>

38:25.597 --> 38:27.349
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

38:27.432 --> 38:28.892
I don't know.

38:30.102 --> 38:32.104
Why'd you kill those guys
who lived here before us?

38:33.564 --> 38:35.607
Why would you rape my mother?

38:39.695 --> 38:41.029
I'm sorry.

38:41.530 --> 38:42.614
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

38:43.115 --> 38:44.658
I was different then.

38:45.617 --> 38:47.286
I used to think you were like me.

38:48.245 --> 38:50.080
You were attracted to the darkness.

38:51.039 --> 38:53.166
But, Tate, you are the darkness.

38:54.126 --> 38:55.544
No.

38:56.461 --> 38:58.505
Before you, that's all there was.

39:01.675 --> 39:04.261
You're the only light I've ever known.

39:07.306 --> 39:09.183
You've changed me, Violet.

39:11.685 --> 39:12.978
I believe that.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.774
I love you, Tate.

39:19.985 --> 39:21.653
But I can't forgive you.

39:24.948 --> 39:26.617
You have to pay for what you did.

39:27.492 --> 39:29.995
All the pain you caused. All the sorrow.

39:30.704 --> 39:31.705
You murdered my mother.

39:31.788 --> 39:33.165
-No!
-You did!

39:34.416 --> 39:37.336
That baby, whatever it was, it killed her.

39:41.882 --> 39:43.133
I can't be with you.

39:44.009 --> 39:45.385
I won't be with you.

39:47.846 --> 39:49.389
What are you saying?

39:50.098 --> 39:51.391
I'm saying go away.

39:51.475 --> 39:54.561
What? No, don't do this.

39:54.645 --> 39:55.979
Go away, Tate.

39:56.063 --> 39:58.690
You're all I want! You're all I have!

39:58.774 --> 40:00.192
Go away!

40:00.275 --> 40:02.027
-(screaming)
-Go away!

40:03.195 --> 40:04.947
(sobbing quietly)

40:17.835 --> 40:19.211
(shudders)

40:20.963 --> 40:22.339
(sobbing)

40:40.983 --> 40:42.526
That was very brave.

40:44.236 --> 40:45.362
I'm proud of you.

40:45.988 --> 40:47.072
Mom.

40:47.656 --> 40:49.074
I'm sorry, Mom.

40:49.616 --> 40:51.076
I'm sorry you had to die.

40:51.493 --> 40:52.578
(shushing)

40:53.829 --> 40:55.622
I'm sorry you lost your baby.

41:04.047 --> 41:06.258
(softly) But I didn't lose my baby.

41:08.218 --> 41:09.928
