00:08.300 --> 00:11.336
I can't believe Mr. Grundy flew
us to New York in his private jet!

00:11.370 --> 00:14.339
It was so awesome! Except
for that crying baby.

00:14.590 --> 00:16.674
Hey, my ears were clogged up.

00:19.395 --> 00:25.266
Everyone! Welcome to the grand
opening of my flagship z-store!

00:25.317 --> 00:26.351
(All cheering)

00:29.238 --> 00:32.390
First, the ceremonial ribbon cutting!

00:33.392 --> 00:36.277
Where are my comically large scissors?

00:37.729 --> 00:38.696
Ah.

00:39.564 --> 00:40.581
Sorry.

00:42.701 --> 00:46.537
I borrowed them to make these
comically large paper dolls.

00:48.407 --> 00:49.407
Aw.

00:49.425 --> 00:52.293
They're holding hands, we're holding hands.

00:52.461 --> 00:54.629
And they're dolls and you're a doll.

00:55.714 --> 00:58.582
And he's nauseous and I'm nauseous.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.220
Okay, everyone.

01:02.254 --> 01:03.421
This is it.

01:04.556 --> 01:07.258
One... Two...

01:07.526 --> 01:08.559
Zee!

01:08.593 --> 01:10.194
(All cheering)

01:12.431 --> 01:15.283
Uh... where are you going? It's a work day!

01:15.534 --> 01:17.652
What? We have to work here?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.405
And wear ugly shirts?

01:21.540 --> 01:22.824
Yes.

01:22.875 --> 01:26.494
Why pay employees when I can
make my students unpaid interns?

01:27.379 --> 01:29.447
Welcome to the z-store.

01:29.465 --> 01:33.501
You will be zelling all
my ztuff with a zmile!

01:36.388 --> 01:38.339

02:34.313 --> 02:35.279
Well...

02:36.281 --> 02:37.398
At least I caught a few of you.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.517
Thank goodness!

02:40.619 --> 02:42.286
I'm going to need help handling the crowds.

02:42.621 --> 02:43.654
What crowds?

02:47.242 --> 02:48.359
Why isn't the store busier?

02:49.244 --> 02:52.363
I spent $20 million on
advertising and promotion.

02:52.631 --> 02:56.667
Well, maybe you should have spent a
little bit more on the "we're open" sign.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.305
Someone should be here.

03:01.540 --> 03:02.590
Where is everybody?

03:03.375 --> 03:05.543

03:14.553 --> 03:16.270
How could he say that?

03:16.321 --> 03:18.523
Z-tech is worth
fitty-figh billion dollars.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.331
Angus, look what I found outside.

03:27.366 --> 03:29.400
Look what I found outside!

03:31.253 --> 03:33.237
I'm going to make a fortune!

03:37.626 --> 03:39.260
Well, this is even better!

03:39.545 --> 03:40.678
Well, for me.

03:41.964 --> 03:45.600
They're holding open video
auditions for a new Broadway musical.

03:45.634 --> 03:48.436
Goldilocks! I'm perfect for it!

03:48.637 --> 03:52.273
Why? Because your legs are
hairy and you growl a lot?

03:52.641 --> 03:54.609
I mean for goldilocks, not the bear!

03:56.612 --> 04:00.615
This is my big chance and Chyna
cannot steal this from under me!

04:00.649 --> 04:05.570
If you whisper one word of this
to her, I will maul you! (Grunts)

04:07.439 --> 04:10.157
Are you sure you don't want
to audition for the bear?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.164
This is great.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.634
The New York museum of art
has something for both of us.

04:20.452 --> 04:22.503
You can admire the paintings,
and I can correct the people

04:22.554 --> 04:24.472
when they mispronounce the artists' names.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.642
Everyone, the museum is thrilled to present

04:27.676 --> 04:33.264
the latest masterpiece by
Ikhagvasuren Balnamdolchoyjijantsan!

04:34.633 --> 04:35.650
Ugh!

04:35.684 --> 04:37.301
She pronounced it right!

04:39.304 --> 04:40.271
Oh, please.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.656
His work is so overrated.

04:41.690 --> 04:43.241
(Scoffs)

04:43.275 --> 04:45.610
I don't know why anyone would like his...
Oh, my gosh!

04:47.579 --> 04:50.331
(Sobbing) It's beautiful!

04:52.284 --> 04:53.451
Fletcher, are you okay?

04:54.536 --> 04:56.320
This painting.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.672
Something about it just...

04:58.423 --> 04:59.674
Moves me to tears.

05:04.296 --> 05:06.330
You know it's not a real onion, right?

05:07.516 --> 05:11.636
I know, but the brush
strokes, and the symbolism...

05:11.670 --> 05:13.554
I'll never paint anything this good.

05:14.506 --> 05:15.556
I'm through with art!

05:16.275 --> 05:18.276
I might as well just become a plumber.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.527
Fletcher, don't be ridiculous.

05:19.561 --> 05:22.313
You can't just quit
art to become a plumber.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.565
Plumbing is way harder. It takes skill.

05:27.235 --> 05:28.286
I'm a total failure!

05:28.487 --> 05:30.321
You're not a failure, Fletcher.

05:30.572 --> 05:34.408
First of all, you have a gorgeous
girlfriend, who's way out of your league.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.462
And you can paint your own masterpiece.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.248
Really? You think so?

05:41.533 --> 05:42.633
I know so.

05:43.368 --> 05:45.202
Come on, let's go get you some art supplies

05:45.220 --> 05:47.204
and you can paint something
way better than this...

05:48.540 --> 05:50.591
(Sobbing) Actually quite beautiful onion.

05:53.428 --> 05:54.395
(Both sobbing)

05:58.383 --> 05:59.600
Excuse me, sir.

06:00.218 --> 06:02.436
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

06:03.271 --> 06:05.573
As you can see, this sign says,

06:06.358 --> 06:07.408
"no loitering."

06:10.278 --> 06:13.364
I've been rapping on this corner long
before there was a z-store here.

06:13.565 --> 06:15.533
If anyone is loitering, it's you.

06:16.284 --> 06:18.419
Do you know who I am?

06:19.254 --> 06:20.237
I think so.

06:38.423 --> 06:41.392
(Tearfully) Okay, that
was some very hurtful flow.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.564
(Chuckles) Hi, I'm Chyna.

06:47.315 --> 06:48.532
'Sup? I'm Hudson.

06:49.368 --> 06:50.401
Listen, Hudson.

06:50.435 --> 06:51.619
I think you're very talented.

06:51.653 --> 06:53.621
But maybe you could find a
different topic to rap about

06:53.655 --> 06:55.272
instead of telling people

06:55.290 --> 06:57.458
they shouldn't waste their
money on anything in this store.

06:58.410 --> 07:01.278
No, it! Wa how may I be of zervice?

07:03.415 --> 07:05.249
Hmm, another topic to rap about?

07:05.283 --> 07:06.617
Yeah! I could do that. Great.

07:06.635 --> 07:10.421

07:23.402 --> 07:25.469
Why don't you just do us
all a favor and go home.

07:26.521 --> 07:28.239
Maybe because I can't.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.273
What?

07:29.441 --> 07:33.327
You live this privileged life and
just assume everyone else does, too.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.613
Well, guess what? I'm from the street.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.618
Hudson, I'm so sorry... Look! Save it.

07:40.652 --> 07:42.620
You don't even know how
to talk to someone like me.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.657
No, but I do.

07:50.328 --> 07:52.463
Mr. Grundy, what are you doing?

07:52.597 --> 07:58.469

you shouldn't have left it on the corner!

08:28.326 --> 08:30.661
Fletcher, this is... This is beautiful.

08:31.396 --> 08:34.331
No, no, no, beautiful
doesn't begin to describe it.

08:34.616 --> 08:36.332
It's... it's stunning.

08:36.451 --> 08:39.586
Exquisite. In a word... Zazow!

08:43.375 --> 08:44.591
Well, of course you like it.

08:45.427 --> 08:46.627
It's a painting by someone you love

08:47.578 --> 08:49.380
of someone you love even more.

08:52.517 --> 08:55.552
But, I'll never be as good as
Ikhagvasuren Balnamdolchoyjijantsan.

08:57.555 --> 09:00.357
(Grunts) Why does everyone
keep pronouncing it right?

09:03.445 --> 09:05.362
Come on, if this were hanging in a museum,

09:05.397 --> 09:07.531
people would think it's
the best thing in the place.

09:09.451 --> 09:12.536
In fact, let's go over there
and hang it up right now.

09:13.371 --> 09:16.206
What? How are we supposed
to get that into the museum?

09:25.667 --> 09:26.633
(Gasping)

09:29.254 --> 09:30.337
What's with your shape?

09:30.555 --> 09:32.172
What's with your shape?

09:37.562 --> 09:39.480
Mr. Grundy!

09:39.514 --> 09:42.483
I thought of how to stop Hudson from
hanging around outside of the store.

09:43.601 --> 09:46.320
Letting him hang around inside the store!

09:48.356 --> 09:50.190
(Chuckles) Chyna!

09:50.442 --> 09:52.409
You hired him without asking me?

09:52.577 --> 09:54.411
Well, maybe you shouldn't have me,

09:54.446 --> 09:57.414
a 14-year-old girl, heading
up your personnel department!

09:59.534 --> 10:01.285
Please, Mr. Grundy.

10:01.453 --> 10:03.287
Look, Hudson's had a tough life,

10:03.321 --> 10:05.539
but all he needs is someone
to give him a chance.

10:05.590 --> 10:07.424
I will personally vouch for him.

10:07.459 --> 10:10.210
Hey, hey, check out how
many of these I can juggle.

10:13.498 --> 10:15.549
Zero. I do not know how to juggle.

10:16.667 --> 10:17.634
Whoo.

10:20.472 --> 10:21.555
(Nervous giggle)

10:22.640 --> 10:24.558
All right. If we're going
to hang this painting,

10:24.609 --> 10:27.444
all you need to do is hammer
this nail into the wall.

10:27.479 --> 10:30.314
Hammering's going to
draw too much attention.

10:30.615 --> 10:32.449
I'll use this nail gun instead.

10:36.371 --> 10:37.354
Okay, but hurry.

10:37.622 --> 10:39.289
I'll keep the curator busy.

10:40.575 --> 10:43.627
Excuse me, ma'am, can I ask you a question?

10:43.661 --> 10:45.245
Well, that's what I'm here for.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.580
Can you help me pick up these toothpicks?

10:53.638 --> 10:54.588
(Nail gun shot)

10:55.340 --> 10:56.590
(Nail gun shots)

11:01.563 --> 11:05.232
I cannot believe what I'm seeing.

11:05.433 --> 11:06.483
Uh, I can explain...

11:07.268 --> 11:09.319
You don't need to explain to me.

11:09.487 --> 11:16.560
I have a PHD in art history and this
is the most cutting edge example

11:16.578 --> 11:20.280
of "installation art" I have ever seen!

11:22.283 --> 11:26.253
I mean, everybody does art about
society's need to break down walls,

11:26.287 --> 11:28.288
but you nailed it!

11:37.715 --> 11:42.269
See? You gave Hudson a chance, and
now he's attracting customers.

11:42.303 --> 11:43.437
He is a good sign spinner.

11:51.596 --> 11:53.430
Okay, Chyna's not looking.

11:53.598 --> 11:55.365
Let's record my "goldilocks" audition.

11:57.735 --> 12:01.455
Angus: I don't mind helping, but
do I really have to be mama bear?

12:03.608 --> 12:04.625
Yes!

12:04.659 --> 12:08.412
The papa bear suit was too big on you
and the baby bear suit was too small!

12:09.247 --> 12:10.614
This one's just right.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.500
(Gasping) Chyna's coming!

12:13.668 --> 12:15.285
Act natural!

12:16.454 --> 12:18.305
As you can see, Ms. Bear,

12:18.506 --> 12:21.558
the new z-pad has features
that will simplify your life.

12:21.593 --> 12:22.676
Hmm?

12:23.428 --> 12:24.561
Ooh! Plus, you'll like this.

12:24.729 --> 12:26.647
It has a hibernation mode.

12:27.649 --> 12:29.266
(Growls)

12:33.655 --> 12:35.339
Did you see that?

12:35.373 --> 12:36.657
Hudson just stole a z-phone!

12:37.308 --> 12:38.609
I'm with a customer.

12:39.744 --> 12:42.529
The z-pad cases come
in a variety of colors.

12:42.697 --> 12:44.481
Including salmon.

12:44.749 --> 12:46.316
(Growling)

13:01.143 --> 13:02.977
Hey, thanks for getting me this job, Chyna.

13:03.128 --> 13:04.228
Zee you tomorrow.

13:05.314 --> 13:07.098
Wait! I know what you're up to!

13:07.266 --> 13:08.466
I'm not up to anything!

13:12.187 --> 13:13.471
You stole a z-phone!

13:13.489 --> 13:14.989
(Scoffs) What?

13:19.495 --> 13:21.312
All right, you caught me.

13:21.447 --> 13:23.081
I stole it.

13:23.115 --> 13:25.116
I don't have a rich
daddy to buy me a phone!

13:25.334 --> 13:27.035
You have to return this!

13:28.370 --> 13:30.321
Once you delete all of these.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.292
Why are there photos of you
and your family in Bermuda?

13:35.344 --> 13:36.494
I stole that family.

13:38.497 --> 13:42.166
And, uh, made them take
me to Bermuda. Yeah.

13:44.336 --> 13:45.303
You're not from the street.

13:46.105 --> 13:47.188
Yes I am!

13:48.273 --> 13:50.058
My house is on a street.

13:50.476 --> 13:51.476
What street?

13:52.394 --> 13:53.478
Easy street.

13:55.230 --> 13:57.348
125 north easy street.

13:59.151 --> 14:01.285
Why would you lie to me about who you are?

14:01.487 --> 14:03.204
Look, I'm a rapper.

14:03.238 --> 14:07.024
The best raps are about having
nothing or having everything.

14:07.042 --> 14:10.161
There are no hit songs about a
comfortable suburban upbringing.

14:10.195 --> 14:11.162
Look.

14:11.497 --> 14:13.998
<i>♪ I spend every night
with a roof above me</i>

14:14.032 --> 14:16.334

they both really love me</i>

14:16.368 --> 14:19.003

<i>♪ we all go to yoga it's

14:24.393 --> 14:27.211
I can't believe you. You're a total phony.

14:28.046 --> 14:29.430
You know, the minute I met you,

14:29.481 --> 14:32.483
I knew you were all
condescending, judgmental...

14:33.385 --> 14:34.435
(Stutters) Pretty...

14:36.321 --> 14:38.272
(Chuckles) Did you just call me pretty?

14:40.275 --> 14:41.492
Uh... (Chuckles)

14:42.244 --> 14:44.028
I don't know what I'm saying.

14:45.114 --> 14:47.198
Mr. Grundy didn't give me a lunch break.

14:47.232 --> 14:48.416
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

14:48.450 --> 14:51.452
I swear I saw a tap-dancing
bear in a skirt. Yeah.

14:54.173 --> 14:58.209
Listen, you don't have to pretend to be
something you're not to impress people.

14:58.243 --> 14:59.343
Especially me.

15:00.078 --> 15:01.129
You'll find your own voice.

15:01.463 --> 15:03.214
You just have to...

15:05.017 --> 15:06.083
Do your own thing.

15:10.222 --> 15:11.973
(Dance music playing)

15:12.024 --> 15:15.359
<i>♪ Gotta lose control everybody knows</i>

15:15.394 --> 15:18.262

16:32.187 --> 16:33.170
(All cheering)

16:38.443 --> 16:41.011
Now, the song is called
"do your own thing,"

16:41.029 --> 16:43.197
not "do your thing in
the middle of my thing."

16:44.149 --> 16:47.151
Sorry, I thought... I'm kidding.
You were great.

16:48.186 --> 16:50.037
And I hope you get the message.

16:50.072 --> 16:52.356
You don't need to front.
I like the real you.

16:54.042 --> 16:55.493
You know, you're pretty smart.

16:56.411 --> 16:59.163
(Chuckles) Did you just
call me pretty again?

17:00.415 --> 17:03.200
I think you pretty much
hear what you want to hear.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.208
Hey, guys.

17:11.226 --> 17:13.010
Did we miss anything?

17:13.044 --> 17:14.095
Chyna sang a song.

17:14.146 --> 17:15.429
And Angus was dressed like a bear.

17:17.398 --> 17:18.983
So, no? Fletcher: No.

17:20.018 --> 17:21.018
Fletcher!

17:21.185 --> 17:23.104
Oh, no, it's the museum curator.

17:23.155 --> 17:25.439
She probably figured out that
my wall damage wasn't really art.

17:25.490 --> 17:28.075
Don't worry. I got this.

17:35.284 --> 17:37.001
Ugh! That usually works!

17:38.503 --> 17:42.423
Fletcher, I've been going
through your portfolio online.

17:42.457 --> 17:45.343
Your artwork is astounding!

17:46.128 --> 17:50.214
I'd like you to be the
museum's artist-in-residence.

17:51.082 --> 17:52.266
Artist-in-residence?

17:53.084 --> 17:54.051
Wait.

17:55.103 --> 17:57.054
Is this a trick to get
me to paint your house?

17:58.140 --> 18:01.942
No. It's a very prestigious fellowship.

18:01.977 --> 18:04.395
We want you to move to New York.

18:05.147 --> 18:06.263
What? What?

18:06.281 --> 18:07.264
See ya!

18:08.433 --> 18:12.403
You'd have a rare opportunity to work
with the world's greatest artists.

18:13.155 --> 18:16.073
We've never offered this
to a teenager before.

18:16.325 --> 18:17.291
Wow!

18:17.993 --> 18:21.111
What an incredible honor. I'm flattered.

18:22.331 --> 18:24.081
But I'm going to have to pass.

18:24.115 --> 18:25.333
What? Why?

18:26.084 --> 18:28.336
My life is in California
with my family and friends.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.455
And most of all, the girl that I love.

18:33.175 --> 18:34.975
Well, I hope you're not doing this for me,

18:35.010 --> 18:36.344
because I was just about
to break up with you.

18:37.128 --> 18:38.179
What? What?

18:38.347 --> 18:39.313
Yes!

18:41.350 --> 18:44.101
Look, it's not me. It's you.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.304
I don't really know why I was
even dating you in the first place.

18:47.322 --> 18:51.192
If you moved to New York,
I would not miss you at all.

18:51.243 --> 18:53.160
Olive? What are you doing?

18:53.195 --> 18:55.329
Moving on. And you should, too.

18:56.147 --> 18:59.083
Sorry, Fletcher. But
"zazow" always ends in "ow."

19:01.453 --> 19:04.038
But I don't think I've
had enough "zaz" yet!

19:04.289 --> 19:06.374
I really like "zaz!"

19:13.098 --> 19:14.181
Well, this worked out.

19:14.216 --> 19:16.217
I'll start the fellowship paperwork.

19:24.226 --> 19:25.192
(Gasping)

19:25.343 --> 19:27.177
Angus, they texted me!

19:27.195 --> 19:28.279
They loved my video audition!

19:28.313 --> 19:29.397
I got the part!

19:29.448 --> 19:31.031
I'm goldilocks!

19:31.233 --> 19:33.016
Congratulations!

19:33.034 --> 19:35.236
(Chuckles) I am also having a good day.

19:40.125 --> 19:43.360
Finally me, Lexi Reed, not Chyna parks,

19:43.378 --> 19:47.164
is going to be the star
of a Broadway musical!

19:49.334 --> 19:52.219
Actually, the flyer
says it's off-Broadway.

19:58.209 --> 20:00.060
Wow, they weren't kidding.

20:00.395 --> 20:03.046
This alley is literally off Broadway.

20:06.217 --> 20:10.187
<i>♪ What a quaint little cottage

20:18.229 --> 20:19.580

20:19.614 --> 20:23.200
<i>♪ Oh, look, three bowls, and

<i>♪ All my life I've searched for something</i>

20:31.409 --> 20:34.345

20:39.384 --> 20:40.468

20:45.440 --> 20:50.194
<i>♪ And I finally found that

20:50.312 --> 20:51.278

20:54.232 --> 20:56.099
(Grunts) This stinks!

20:56.117 --> 20:57.318
I beg to differ!

20:57.486 --> 20:59.102
Bravo!

20:59.270 --> 21:00.371
All: Bravo!

21:14.419 --> 21:16.119
You took the fellowship?

21:17.422 --> 21:21.008
So, you're really not coming
back to the ant farm with us?

21:21.459 --> 21:23.344
Look, it's an incredible opportunity.

21:24.062 --> 21:26.146
And even my parents said I should go.

21:26.398 --> 21:28.399
I'm going to be living in
Brooklyn with my grandma Dottie.

21:30.402 --> 21:31.352
Fletcher,

21:32.437 --> 21:34.304
not only are you my best friend,

21:35.106 --> 21:37.074
but I've loved being roommates
with you this past year.

21:38.243 --> 21:40.411
And if you ever decide
New York isn't for you,

21:41.145 --> 21:42.329
our room will always be there.

21:47.168 --> 21:50.487
Of course, your bed will be gone and
replaced with a soft pretzel machine.

21:52.173 --> 21:54.258
I know. You did that two months ago.

21:57.161 --> 21:58.128
Fletcher,

21:59.464 --> 22:02.165
you and I never got to know each
other that well back at school.

22:03.167 --> 22:04.184
Thank you for that.

22:06.354 --> 22:07.471
You're welcome?

22:10.392 --> 22:12.026
(Chuckles) Hey, whoa.

22:12.176 --> 22:13.343
I barely know you.

22:27.208 --> 22:28.208
Fletcher,

22:29.544 --> 22:33.047
since the day you showed up at
my house in a top hat and monocle,

22:33.081 --> 22:35.165
I knew I wanted you to
be my friend forever.

22:37.252 --> 22:39.202
I can't believe we're saying goodbye.

22:40.305 --> 22:41.422
I don't care where I am,

22:42.257 --> 22:44.141
you're always going to
be a part of my life.

22:46.394 --> 22:48.378
I wouldn't be who I am
if it weren't for you.

22:49.213 --> 22:50.180
What do you mean?

22:50.515 --> 22:54.384
When you first arrived at the ant
farm, I was this scared little kid.

22:55.236 --> 22:59.222
And you were so confident and fearless.

22:59.441 --> 23:01.191
You made me not be afraid.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.244
And now, I'm moving to New York!

23:04.279 --> 23:05.412
By myself.

23:07.415 --> 23:10.067
I really don't know how I'm
going to do it without you.

23:11.369 --> 23:12.336
(Chuckles)

23:20.428 --> 23:22.096
(Sniffling) Oh, don't worry.

23:22.464 --> 23:25.182
You'll find another girl
to obsess over for years

23:25.216 --> 23:28.218
and then completely forget about
so you can date her best friend.

23:29.521 --> 23:33.107
You know, I never thought
Olive and I would get together,

23:33.525 --> 23:37.194
but on we dice I'd never
felt anything so real.

23:39.230 --> 23:41.148
I guess I was the only
one who felt that way.

23:41.432 --> 23:43.033
(Olive sobbing)

23:44.369 --> 23:47.037
I think that garbage can is crying.

23:49.124 --> 23:51.408
I really should have given
myself a lunch break today.

23:54.462 --> 23:56.113
(Snorting)

23:57.132 --> 23:59.383
Olive? What are you doing in here?

24:00.284 --> 24:04.287
Just making sure Fletcher really
leaves because I hate him so much.

24:05.423 --> 24:06.974
Wait.

24:07.225 --> 24:09.459
Did you break up with me just so
I wouldn't miss this opportunity?

24:11.062 --> 24:12.096
Maybe.

24:13.064 --> 24:14.181
Thank you, Olive.

24:15.266 --> 24:16.233
I love you, too.

24:20.488 --> 24:21.471
(Car honking)

24:25.476 --> 24:27.077
There's grandma Dottie.

24:30.498 --> 24:32.032
Whoa!

24:32.083 --> 24:34.084
Grandma Dottie is grandma hottie.

24:37.088 --> 24:39.123
She's actually my step-grandmother.

24:39.257 --> 24:41.341
My grandpa Zeke was loaded.

24:43.211 --> 24:46.296
So she's a widow who likes wealthy men?

24:47.076 --> 24:48.777
Maybe I'll move to New York.

24:52.081 --> 24:53.148
Nah.

24:53.182 --> 24:54.949
I'd miss you guys too much.

25:03.826 --> 25:06.010
Man, it's weird being in the
Ant Farm without Fletcher.

25:06.846 --> 25:07.846
(Tongue clicks) Yeah.

25:09.632 --> 25:10.665
You doing okay?

25:10.883 --> 25:15.604
Yeah. I mean, I miss him, But I guess
it'll be just us single ladies now.

25:15.638 --> 25:16.605
(Chuckles)

25:17.523 --> 25:18.773
We should do pretty well.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.692
I'm zazow! And you're...

25:20.977 --> 25:22.527
Zaz-okay.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.897
Well, I'm cool with some girl time.

25:25.948 --> 25:27.566
Just me and you.

25:28.734 --> 25:30.652
Ooh, man. This school is on point!

25:30.786 --> 25:32.571
Do you guys have a yoga studio?

25:34.857 --> 25:36.875
Hudson? What are you doing here?

25:36.909 --> 25:38.793
Z-money asked me to join the school.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.746
And my new rap label, zip zop.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.967
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A rap prodigy?

25:46.802 --> 25:49.804
Doesn't that kind of step
on someone else's territory?
