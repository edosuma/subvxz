[Bobby faking a sneeze]

00:37.265 --> 00:38.391
Look.

00:38.900 --> 00:43.200
Here's a few more pictures
of a certain yearbook editor's boyfriend.

00:43.705 --> 00:46.970
Look at this one of me
with a French fry up my nose.

00:47.209 --> 00:50.337
That's okay, Bobby.
I already have your class photo.

00:50.445 --> 00:51.707
That's it?

00:51.880 --> 00:56.579
But I'm a sure bet for class clown.
Shouldn't that get me some coverage?

00:56.818 --> 00:59.844
The PTA said we can't do
the eighth-grade poll anymore.

00:59.955 --> 01:01.422
What? Why not?

01:01.723 --> 01:05.159
Last year's worst dresser
turned out to be really poor.

01:06.161 --> 01:09.289
Class clown was my ticket to immortality.

01:09.598 --> 01:11.930
Now I'm no different from any other kid.

01:12.367 --> 01:15.530
I'm like a Stu Harriet or a Mike Soto.

01:15.637 --> 01:19.573
Actually, Mike is president
of the Junior Volunteers Club.

01:21.343 --> 01:22.935
So, in 20 years...

01:23.044 --> 01:26.912
everyone will remember
Mike Soto bowling with blind kids.

01:27.148 --> 01:30.982
But Bobby Hill's talking tummy
will be long forgotten.

01:31.820 --> 01:33.754
Where's the justice?

01:40.195 --> 01:41.628
Have you seen my duct tape?

01:41.730 --> 01:44.460
Not the shiny silver, but the matte gray?

01:44.833 --> 01:46.926
Hey, that's my old "Landry Lantern."

01:47.035 --> 01:50.061
Dad, do you realize you're in 10 photos...

01:50.171 --> 01:52.264
not counting your class photo?

01:52.507 --> 01:54.475
Yeah. That sounds about right.

01:55.143 --> 01:57.134
Hey, there's Cleave Worthington.

01:57.746 --> 02:00.909
And Don Postley,
back when he had all his fingers.

02:01.283 --> 02:02.580
And Dub Taylor.

02:02.684 --> 02:06.484
Boy, he was the best mascot
Arlen's ever had. What a wild man.

02:07.989 --> 02:10.321
And all the nicknames we had for him.

02:10.824 --> 02:13.794
Daffy Dub, Rub-a-Dub-Dub.

02:16.831 --> 02:18.856
I guess those were the only two.

02:19.100 --> 02:22.627
Dad, I was thinking of taking
some blind kids bowling.

02:23.004 --> 02:24.938
Bobby, that's not funny.

02:29.711 --> 02:31.611
MR. GRANDY: The bake sale
was a big success...

02:31.713 --> 02:35.547
raising enough money to buy
a new pewter baton for moi.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.550
Give yourselves a big hand.

02:38.787 --> 02:41.551
And hats off to Mike Soto
for spearheading that.

02:43.124 --> 02:44.921
That kid's a machine!

02:46.294 --> 02:50.492
Mr. Grandy, you're looking
at your next Landry Longhorn.

02:50.599 --> 02:53.693
What makes you think you've got
what it takes to wear the horns?

02:53.802 --> 02:58.068
I'm a cutup. I'm a clown.
I'll do anything for attention.

02:58.173 --> 02:59.231
Remember?

02:59.341 --> 03:01.832
That's why you kicked me out of chorus.

03:01.943 --> 03:04.343
Tryouts will be after school
on Wednesday.

03:04.446 --> 03:06.471
And I want all pep, no filler.

03:07.015 --> 03:11.475
And remember, you'll be performing for
a man who's seen a lot of pep in his day.

03:12.153 --> 03:13.279
A lot.

03:16.024 --> 03:19.084
My name is Bobby. I like to party.

03:19.728 --> 03:23.061
And if you don't believe me,
watch me shake my body!

03:23.398 --> 03:25.229
- Bobby!
- Dad!

03:26.301 --> 03:29.236
HANK: That mirror is for practicing
golf swings in...

03:29.337 --> 03:31.305
not your prop comedy.

03:31.406 --> 03:34.739
I'm coming up with shtick
for the Longhorn auditions.

03:34.876 --> 03:37.572
You're going out for the Landry Longhorn?

03:38.079 --> 03:41.981
So, you're not prancing around the garage
at all. You're training.

03:42.083 --> 03:43.050
Yeah.

03:43.251 --> 03:45.617
But I need an angle, a hook...

03:45.720 --> 03:48.917
some kind of boffo gimmick
to set me apart.

03:49.391 --> 03:53.828
Well, how about your own set of horns?
I bet I could rig something up.

03:54.663 --> 03:58.064
Dad, you would build me a prop?

03:59.100 --> 04:01.796
In this case, Son, yes, I would.

04:06.608 --> 04:10.044
That dang Mike Soto!
Where does he find the time?

04:14.015 --> 04:16.711
I'll give him this, he is flexible.

04:18.987 --> 04:20.887
This is really heating up.

04:20.988 --> 04:23.150
Next victim, Bobby Hill.

04:28.463 --> 04:31.023
Would you like Arlen, Fight, Fight, Fight?
Or...

04:31.132 --> 04:33.464
We are the Landry Men,
Fight, Fight, Fight?

04:33.568 --> 04:36.128
Thank you, sir, but I brought my own tape.

04:36.271 --> 04:37.329
Fine.

[Upbeat pop music playing]

05:09.537 --> 05:11.630
Please, hold your applause.

05:40.635 --> 05:43.468
BOBBY: Tonight,
Tom Landry Middle School!

05:44.873 --> 05:47.103
- Yup.
- Yup.

[Cell phone ringing]

05:57.152 --> 05:59.450
Hey!

06:00.855 --> 06:03.255
I'm talking on it right now. Yeah.

06:03.858 --> 06:06.622
All right. Talk to you later. Bye.

06:07.061 --> 06:08.551
That was Jimmy.

06:09.564 --> 06:11.759
The guy who sold me the phone.

06:12.834 --> 06:16.031
I did it, Dad! I'm the Longhorn!

06:16.137 --> 06:18.298
Way to go, Bobby. That's great!

06:18.406 --> 06:21.136
Way to go, Bobby. That's great!

06:22.143 --> 06:25.670
Now we're both
part of the Arlen football tradition.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.677
Longhorns!

06:29.083 --> 06:32.018
And look at that.
It's still got all the rips and tears.

06:32.120 --> 06:36.318
Boy, you can almost hear all those
years of McMaynerbury's whuppings!

06:36.758 --> 06:38.749
This calls for a special dinner.

06:39.027 --> 06:42.622
I'm gonna go tell your mother
to make us a special dinner.

06:44.098 --> 06:45.963
McMaynerbury whupping.

06:46.201 --> 06:48.863
That's like "whoop, whoop, whoop," right?

06:49.103 --> 06:53.540
No. "Whupping" as in "the big beat
down," as in "half-time hammering"...

06:53.641 --> 06:56.906
as in the "McMaynerbury
mascot massacre," as in...

06:57.011 --> 06:58.672
Am I missing something?

06:58.813 --> 07:02.749
Whenever Arlen is winning, it's
a tradition for the McMaynerbury band...

07:02.851 --> 07:05.752
to charge the Longhorn
and give him a pounding!

07:05.854 --> 07:07.719
It's a real crowd-pleaser.

07:07.822 --> 07:08.880
Yeah, man.

07:08.990 --> 07:13.825
Did your dad used to like scoring the
touchdown that got Dub Taylor pounded.

07:14.195 --> 07:15.253
Really?

07:15.430 --> 07:18.331
Maybe McMaynerbury
will take an early lead...

07:18.433 --> 07:21.027
and hold it for the rest of the game.

07:21.135 --> 07:24.263
- Yeah, that never happens.
- McMaynerbury.

07:24.606 --> 07:28.372
Yeah, and maybe I'll file
a federal income tax return.

07:30.945 --> 07:33.846
That goes in my big book of "So theres."

07:40.054 --> 07:44.150
If I get a good action shot of you, I'm
willing to dump the model U.N. Spread.

07:44.325 --> 07:47.158
Who cares?
McMaynerbury's gonna kill me.

07:47.495 --> 07:50.896
I'm a lover, not a... I'm not even a lover.

07:51.065 --> 07:53.693
Then wheel that costume
back down to Grandy's office...

07:53.801 --> 07:56.235
and tell him to find himself
another punching bag.

07:56.337 --> 07:58.066
Woman, I can't get out of this.

07:58.172 --> 08:01.335
Imagine telling your dad
you were quitting violin.

08:02.076 --> 08:05.443
I do. All the time. I hate that violin.

08:16.424 --> 08:19.985
And at the end of the first quarter,
McMaynerbury leads 10-to-7.

08:20.395 --> 08:23.922
The Longhorn is safe, for now.

08:26.401 --> 08:28.301

- Bury!

Hang tough, McMaynerbury.

08:39.647 --> 08:41.842

08:42.582 --> 08:46.383
Cheer up, Keegan.
No shame in losing to a better team.

08:46.587 --> 08:49.420
Hey, those McMaynerbury scrubs
are going down, buddy.

08:49.524 --> 08:52.721
- You better get ready for a whupping.
- Oh, yeah, totally.

08:52.827 --> 08:56.354
I hope we beat them so bad
I get two whuppings!

gonna be piÃ±ata for marching band!

That's funny.

Kahn, who is that taking pictures
of your daughter taking pictures of Bobby?

09:13.781 --> 09:15.476
No one, that's who.

09:16.217 --> 09:19.152
Quarterback sneak.
Caught them with their pants down!

09:20.355 --> 09:24.257
Touchdown! Arlen take lead!

09:25.159 --> 09:28.322
It's all good.

09:39.374 --> 09:42.707
Hank, tell me what's going on.
I can't watch.

09:43.978 --> 09:46.606
- He's history.
- Yeah.

09:53.121 --> 09:55.214
BOY: Bobby Hill, get back here!

09:55.323 --> 09:58.554
Wait. No. This is some kind of comedy bit.

09:58.659 --> 10:01.059
He's gonna turn around any second.

10:01.929 --> 10:04.898
Maybe he's just going to the car to get a...

10:05.867 --> 10:07.164
He's gone.

10:12.306 --> 10:16.208
I'm not surprised McMaynerbury won
after that happened.

10:16.711 --> 10:18.576
God, I needed to use the restroom...

10:18.679 --> 10:21.546
but I couldn't face the guys at the trough.

10:22.884 --> 10:24.146
There he is.

10:37.498 --> 10:41.764
Whether people were booing or cheering,
you got a reaction.

10:41.869 --> 10:44.269
And, by golly, that's what counts.

10:48.176 --> 10:50.974
They should call Bobby "The Lame Horn."

10:53.948 --> 10:56.416
What's he gonna do
for the big game against Belton?

10:56.517 --> 10:58.508
Show up in a chicken suit?

[Imitating a chicken]

11:04.625 --> 11:06.889
I've got to take my mind off of this.

I'm gonna treat myself
to the hardware store.

11:23.444 --> 11:25.935
Well, at least they toned it down.

11:26.047 --> 11:28.880

they went after my family.

11:28.983 --> 11:31.508
Don't worry, Bobby.
Even with all the letters...

11:31.619 --> 11:34.645
I won't take your class picture
out of the yearbook.

11:37.024 --> 11:39.117
- Nurse Jennings?
- Pick them up.

11:42.597 --> 11:44.326
I said pick them up.

11:51.405 --> 11:54.374
Bobby, I'm gonna need you
to turn in your keys and your horns.

11:54.475 --> 11:56.409
My office, five minutes.

12:12.393 --> 12:14.452
Longhorns!

12:17.632 --> 12:20.897
I understand you're just a kid.
At the same time...

12:21.002 --> 12:25.268
what you did at the game was the most
shameful act of cowardice I've ever seen.

12:25.373 --> 12:26.601
Sir, please.

12:26.707 --> 12:30.643
I was born to wear the horns.
You can't take them away from me.

12:30.745 --> 12:33.976
I've got a plan. A great plan.
And it's gonna work.

12:34.348 --> 12:36.612
- Yeah? What's the plan?
- I can't tell you.

12:36.717 --> 12:38.651
- Why not?
- It's a secret.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.386
Well, I do love secrets.

12:43.291 --> 12:45.122
You came to see me?

12:47.995 --> 12:49.189
Hang on.

12:52.466 --> 12:53.865
State your purpose.

12:53.968 --> 12:57.199
Mr. Gribble, what would you say
if I told you...

12:57.305 --> 13:01.036
I am gonna steal
the Belton armadillo tonight?

13:01.142 --> 13:03.440
I would say you're a madman...

13:03.678 --> 13:06.772
or a genius. Maybe a little of both.

13:06.948 --> 13:09.041
I'll go 60-40.

13:09.150 --> 13:11.118
I need someone who knows alarms.

13:11.219 --> 13:13.153
And you've got the most
in the neighborhood.

13:13.254 --> 13:18.021
Ever since those swaggering Bouchet
brothers stole the armadillo back in '76...

13:18.125 --> 13:21.060
Belton's been keeping it
under pretty tight security.

13:21.162 --> 13:25.462
That middle school is impregnable.
Cannot be pregnated.

13:25.866 --> 13:29.165
Except by me. But I don't come cheap.

13:29.337 --> 13:30.998
I don't have a lot of money.

13:31.105 --> 13:33.733
Fine. I'll come cheap. You got $5?

13:33.841 --> 13:35.672
- I can get $4.
- I'm in.

- With what?

ON TV: It's just so great
to have you with us again.

13:47.822 --> 13:51.383
It just seems that every time
that Julia Roberts is on TV...

13:51.492 --> 13:53.722
it is only to yap about her movie.

13:53.828 --> 13:57.127
Well, I'm headed over
to Keegan Evans' house.

13:57.465 --> 14:00.434
Really? But his dad said he hated you.

14:00.668 --> 14:04.468
For what? The running away thing?
That's ancient history.

14:04.905 --> 14:07.499
Some of the guys from the team
are sleeping over.

14:07.608 --> 14:12.477
So, you won't see me or hear from me
until the game tomorrow.

14:12.580 --> 14:15.515
Well, that's great.
Now, don't let them tease you too much.

14:15.616 --> 14:18.278
Remember, you're the mascot,
not the place-kicker.

14:18.386 --> 14:20.513
Hey, Dad. I was thinking...

14:20.621 --> 14:23.647
maybe you want to invite
Dub Taylor to the game.

14:23.891 --> 14:26.086
Dub Taylor? Are you sure?

14:26.227 --> 14:28.161
I want you to hear from him...

14:28.262 --> 14:31.527
that I'm the best mascot
since he wore the horns.

14:46.247 --> 14:49.216
Steady.

14:49.317 --> 14:52.844
- What's going on?
- I'm reading lips.

14:53.954 --> 14:56.616
There's four kids in there.
And tough ones, too.

14:56.724 --> 14:59.716
Don't you have some poisons
in your truck you can pump in there...

14:59.827 --> 15:01.260
to make them fall asleep?

15:01.362 --> 15:05.162
I do. But the amount of poison
that can put four kids to sleep...

15:05.266 --> 15:07.791
might also kill an armadillo.

15:08.002 --> 15:09.731
And the kids might not wake up.

15:09.837 --> 15:13.329
Well, how are we gonna get the dillo
away from four kids?

15:13.641 --> 15:17.600
We're lucky.
According to the one they call Dude...

15:17.878 --> 15:19.641
there used to be eight guardians.

15:19.747 --> 15:22.545
The other four went to steal
the Longhorn costume...

15:22.650 --> 15:24.880
where they will run into, what...

15:24.985 --> 15:28.853
two dozen of the baddest-assed
eighth-graders protecting the costume?

15:28.956 --> 15:31.789
But I didn't...
Nobody said anything about...

15:31.892 --> 15:34.190
Please tell me
you at least put up a maze of mirrors...

15:34.295 --> 15:37.025
to thwart the would-be costume-rustlers.

15:37.765 --> 15:39.198
Broken glass?

15:39.867 --> 15:41.164
Oil slick?

15:42.069 --> 15:43.627
Piece of string?

15:46.474 --> 15:50.501
Go! You save the costume.
I'll find a parking space.

16:14.735 --> 16:18.193
Go away!
The Longhorn is heavily guarded!

16:18.305 --> 16:22.173
BOY: Who's that? Bobby Hill?
Come on, guys. We had better go.

16:30.217 --> 16:31.775
Bill, it's Dale.

16:32.052 --> 16:34.850
Guess who's got your cell phone?

16:38.259 --> 16:40.386
Mr. Gribble, help!

16:40.494 --> 16:43.190
How? Be specific, Bobby.

16:43.297 --> 16:45.788
I'm not a mind-reader here.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.868
They're breaking down the door!

16:49.370 --> 16:50.735
Wait for me!

16:51.272 --> 16:54.673
Why don't you just run away
like you did at McMaynerbury?

16:54.775 --> 16:58.336
Or, you can stay and take the beating
you missed out on.

17:00.614 --> 17:01.706
Yeah.

17:04.551 --> 17:07.214
- What a coward.
- It's too bad.

17:07.555 --> 17:11.150
- I wanted to give him a beating.
- Yeah!

17:16.964 --> 17:19.558
Peanuts! Get your peanuts!

17:19.666 --> 17:21.657
I think I see Bobby. I...

17:22.036 --> 17:25.368
Wait. No. That's a smudge on my glasses.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.031
Hank, look at this smudge.
It looks just like Bobby.

17:29.143 --> 17:30.667
Hey, Daffy Dub!

17:31.312 --> 17:34.804
Over here. You old son of a gun,
how was the drive?

17:34.915 --> 17:39.045
This stinking crowd is dead!
What is this? Guldang Wimbledon?

17:39.220 --> 17:41.848
[Chanting]
Here we go, Longhorns. Here we go!

17:42.790 --> 17:46.590
- What'd I tell you about Dub?
- That he has a lot of pep.

17:47.194 --> 17:48.627
That's right.

17:48.762 --> 17:51.560
[Chanting] We are the Landry Men!
Fight, fight, fight!

17:55.603 --> 17:58.902
- You got any face paint?
- Peggy's got lipstick.

17:59.440 --> 18:03.274
Oh, my God!
It's Peggy Platter from West Arlen.

18:03.511 --> 18:04.842
West Arlen sucks!

18:06.881 --> 18:08.508
Well, isn't this ironic?

18:08.616 --> 18:12.848
The best Longhorn ever,
and the father of the worst Longhorn ever.

18:14.455 --> 18:18.551
I say that because Bobby was guarding
the Longhorn costume last night.

18:18.659 --> 18:21.492
And some kids came to steal it,
and he turned tail and ran.

18:21.595 --> 18:24.962
That's impossible. Bobby was
sleeping over at Keegan Evans' house.

18:25.065 --> 18:28.193
The sleepover was a cover story.
I was with him.

18:28.302 --> 18:31.396
We were trying to steal the Belton
armadillo, and long story short...

18:31.505 --> 18:33.234
you raised a coward.

18:33.474 --> 18:34.702
Oh, God!

18:34.842 --> 18:36.207
Wait. You were with him?

18:36.310 --> 18:38.175
Where is he? Where's my baby boy?

18:38.279 --> 18:39.610
Don't worry, Peggy.

18:39.780 --> 18:43.614
He probably camped out in some bushes.
No, that takes guts.

18:43.717 --> 18:45.810
He probably spent the night at Denny's.

18:45.920 --> 18:49.117
I drove all the way from Pensacola
for this?

18:49.523 --> 18:51.957
I came here for a football game,
not a soap opera!

18:52.059 --> 18:55.324
Hey, Landry losers!
Where's your Longhorn?

18:58.832 --> 19:00.697
MAN: Our mascot sucks!

19:00.801 --> 19:02.098
That's it!

19:02.903 --> 19:05.269
Let's get out of here before Dub gets back.

19:05.372 --> 19:09.331
- How many days is he staying with us?
- Three.

19:18.419 --> 19:22.219
Man, I didn't become a cheerleader
to guard a trashcan.

19:28.262 --> 19:30.924
Ouch. Foot asleep.

19:33.867 --> 19:37.530
Okay, Mister Crackers. Nice and easy.
Nobody gets hurt.

19:48.682 --> 19:51.378
If anyone yells,
"There's Bobby Hill's parents"...

19:51.485 --> 19:54.249
just start to look around, saying, "Where?"

19:58.659 --> 20:01.127
Oh, no! Security!

20:07.167 --> 20:08.395
This way!

20:17.778 --> 20:21.544
Can't touch this! B-E-L-T-O-N.

20:21.649 --> 20:23.640
Go, Belton!

20:24.151 --> 20:25.550
There you are!

20:25.653 --> 20:28.349
All right, kid. Step slowly towards me...

20:28.455 --> 20:30.423
and surrender Mister Crackers.

20:32.226 --> 20:35.753
Yeah, that's right. They'll rip you apart.

20:41.735 --> 20:45.694
BOBBY: Hey, you Belton losers!
Look what I found!

20:46.073 --> 20:47.062
Bobby?

20:47.174 --> 20:50.268
Bobby Hill-o got the dillo!

20:52.446 --> 20:55.313
Check it out, Peggy.
Bobby's got Mister Crackers.

20:55.482 --> 20:57.347
Bobby's got Mister Crackers!

21:00.387 --> 21:02.446
Bite its face off!

21:04.124 --> 21:05.352
Get him!

21:05.759 --> 21:07.249
You can't get this!

21:08.696 --> 21:09.856
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

21:09.963 --> 21:11.453
Hey, Bobby Hill!

21:11.565 --> 21:13.192
Longhorns!

21:15.436 --> 21:16.733
Wonderful!

21:21.375 --> 21:23.741
All right, Bobby! Way to go, Son!

21:28.415 --> 21:30.849
Bobby just started a new tradition.

21:30.951 --> 21:35.012
Now we have the McMaynerbury
whupping and the Belton beating.

21:35.355 --> 21:37.482
What a great time to be a Longhorn.

22:26.406 --> 22:29.000
We are the Landry Men! Fight, fight, fight!
