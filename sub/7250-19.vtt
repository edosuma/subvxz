05:57.107 --> 05:59.234
YEAH, AND WE VETOED

05:57.107 --> 05:59.234

05:59.276 --> 06:02.237
SO YOURS IS BETTER?

05:59.276 --> 06:02.237
FOLLOW THEM TO

05:59.276 --> 06:02.237
THE EDGE OF THE DESERT

06:02.279 --> 06:03.530
IS MEMORABLE AND CLASSY.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.324
I RUN OUT OF BREATH

06:03.571 --> 06:05.324
SAYING IT.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.285
YOU'VE GOT ASTHMA. YOU RUN

06:05.364 --> 06:08.285
OUTTA BREATH SAYING YOUR NAME.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.871
WE CAN'T WORK OUR NAME AROUND

06:08.327 --> 06:10.871
YOUR RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.333
EVEN WITHOUT AN INHALER,

06:10.912 --> 06:14.333
THAT NAME IS TOO LONG.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.500
BUT WHEN WE GET FAMOUS,

06:15.542 --> 06:18.128
OUR FANS WILL SHORTEN IT

06:15.542 --> 06:18.128
TO F-T-T-T-E-O-T-D.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.255
DO YOU GUYS HAVE

06:18.170 --> 06:20.255
ANY SUGGESTIONS?

06:20.297 --> 06:22.132
WE WOULDN'T DARE.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.634
HOW WILL YOU PLAY

06:22.174 --> 06:24.634
WITH YOUR MOM BEING SO STRICT?

06:24.676 --> 06:27.428
RORY AND JESS ARE GONNA DELIVER

06:24.676 --> 06:27.428
MY DRUMS TO KYLE'S HOUSE.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.139
YOUNG CHUI

06:27.470 --> 06:29.139

06:29.181 --> 06:32.142

06:29.181 --> 06:32.142
SEVENTH DAY ADVENTIST

06:29.181 --> 06:32.142
BOWLING PARTY

06:32.184 --> 06:34.311
THAT WILL LAST

06:32.184 --> 06:34.311
OUR GIG'S LENGTH.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.354
NICE GOING.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.646
I'VE GOT MY OWN BALL

06:35.394 --> 06:36.646
AND SHOES.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.148
DUDE, DON'T TELL PEOPLE THAT.

06:39.398 --> 06:40.441
SEE YOU, GUYS.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.194
YEAH, SEE YA.

06:42.236 --> 06:42.903

06:42.944 --> 06:44.363
THE WE?

06:44.403 --> 06:47.324
WE?

06:44.403 --> 06:47.324
YEAH. WE ARE THE WE.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.159
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT

06:47.366 --> 06:49.159
THIS ANYMORE.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.079
SO, ANY WORD ON YOUR CAR?

06:49.201 --> 06:52.079
NOTHING.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.580
YOU THINK SOMEONE

06:52.120 --> 06:53.580
WOULD'VE FOUND IT.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.123
IT WAS PRETTY

06:53.621 --> 06:55.123
ONE-OF-A-KIND.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.209
IT'S PROBABLY HOLED UP

06:55.165 --> 06:57.209
IN SOME CHOP SHOP.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.336
SAY GOODBYE.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.336
IT'S GONE. WHATEVER.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.962
LET'S TALK ABOUT

06:59.378 --> 07:00.962
SOMETHING ELSE.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.547
I LIKE YOU'RE

07:01.004 --> 07:02.547
GETTING TO KNOW DAVE.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.383
YEAH. HE'S A COOL GUY.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.927
IT'S GONNA MAKE US GOING TO

07:04.423 --> 07:06.927
PROM TOGETHER MORE FUN.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.138
I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.138
YOU WERE TRYING TO FORGET IT.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.391
I AGREED TO GO,

07:10.180 --> 07:12.391
I'M A MAN OF MY WORD.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.352
HOW'S THAT ARM I TWISTED?

07:12.432 --> 07:15.352
I GOT THE FEELING BACK.

07:15.394 --> 07:18.105
IF THERE WAS ONE MORE DANCE

07:15.394 --> 07:18.105
I'D WANT TO GO TO,

07:18.146 --> 07:21.358
IT'S THE STARS HOLLOW HIGH PROM.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.358
WITH LANE -- THAT'S A BIG PART.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.193
I'M GETTING THE TICKETS

07:21.400 --> 07:23.193
THIS WEEK.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.193
I'LL PAY, OKAY?

07:23.235 --> 07:27.239
NOT A CHANCE.

07:23.235 --> 07:27.239
IT MEANS A TUX, YOU KNOW?

07:27.281 --> 07:28.448
I KNOW IT'S GEEKY.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.367
TUXES ARE ALSO JAMES BOND.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.367
THAT'S NOT GEEKY.

07:30.409 --> 07:34.204
YOU'RE KIND.

07:30.409 --> 07:34.204
AND GOING TO STASH A CHANGE

07:30.409 --> 07:34.204

07:41.169 --> 07:42.337
YEAH?

07:42.379 --> 07:45.424
I NEED LOVE AND A HUG.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.424
I HAD TO LAY OFF JULIO.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.176
OH, POOR THING.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.176
IT'S THE THIRD ONE TODAY.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.178
ALL I'M DOING IS CRUSHING

07:48.218 --> 07:50.178
PEOPLE'S SPIRITS.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.389
BUT YOU TOLD THEM

07:50.220 --> 07:52.389
THAT WE LOVE THEM

07:52.431 --> 07:54.641
AND WE'LL HIRE THEM SOON

07:52.431 --> 07:54.641
AS THE REPAIRS ARE DONE.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.310
I GAVE THEM

07:54.682 --> 07:56.310
THEIR SEVERANCE CHECKS,

07:56.351 --> 07:58.395
THEY WERE VERY GRACIOUS,

07:56.351 --> 07:58.395
WHICH MADE IT HARDER.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.563
WE'RE GONNA GET THEM BACK.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.563
IT'LL BE GOOD AGAIN.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
WE GOTTA LAY OFF FRANK,

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
BUT I COULDN'T DO ANOTHER ONE,

08:03.566 --> 08:05.402
SO MICHEL OFFERED TO DO IT.

08:05.444 --> 08:06.778
DID HE SAY HE'D BE NICE?

08:06.820 --> 08:09.281
YES, AND THEN HE SKIPPED OFF

08:06.820 --> 08:09.281
TO DO IT.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.950
WHAT'S GOING ON

08:09.323 --> 08:11.950
WITH LUKE HERE?

08:09.323 --> 08:11.950
I DON'T KNOW.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.453
I'VE BEEN KEEPING MY DISTANCE

08:11.992 --> 08:14.453
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.246
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.246
WELL...

08:16.288 --> 08:19.416
HE WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR

08:16.288 --> 08:19.416
PRETTY MUCH LIKE THAT,

08:19.458 --> 08:21.168
TINKERING WITH STUFF

08:19.458 --> 08:21.168
BACK THERE.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.212
AND I GOT DOWN AND LEANED IN

08:21.209 --> 08:24.212
TO SEE WHAT HE WAS DOING,

08:24.254 --> 08:27.215
AND AFTER A WHILE

08:24.254 --> 08:27.215
I REALIZED THAT

08:27.257 --> 08:29.550
THE WHOLE TIME

08:27.257 --> 08:29.550
MY HAND WAS ON HIS BUTT.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.303
SOOKIE!

08:29.592 --> 08:31.303
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.221
IT'S GETTING VERY

08:31.345 --> 08:33.221
CINEMAX AT NIGHT IN HERE.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.473
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.476
UH-HUH, SO...

08:34.514 --> 08:37.476
HOW WAS IT?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.477
HIS BUTT?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.477
YEAH.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.644
GOT A NICE SHAPE TO IT.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.272
WILL YOU TWO STOP TALKING

08:39.686 --> 08:42.272
ABOUT MY BUTT?

08:42.314 --> 08:44.316
IT'S ALL POSITIVE.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.316
AND IN BAD TASTE.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.067
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT

08:44.358 --> 08:46.067
AFTER YOU LEAVE.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.487
WHICH IS NOW BECAUSE I'M DONE.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.487
SO WHAT'S THE PROGNOSIS?

08:48.528 --> 08:52.491
SAME AS THE STOVE COMPANY SAID

08:48.528 --> 08:52.491
THE WALL BACK HERE IS BURNED.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.495
YOU GOTTA REBUILD THE WHOLE

08:52.532 --> 08:56.495
THING BEFORE YOU CAN RECONNECT

08:52.532 --> 08:56.495
THE GAS.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.996
IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE. SORRY.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.498
NO, LUKE.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.498
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.582
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

08:59.539 --> 09:01.582
THE CONTRACTOR SAID.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.504
WE WANTED A GUY

09:01.624 --> 09:05.504
WITH A GOOD BUTT'S OPINION.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.504
YEAH. TOM HAS A TERRIBLE BUTT.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.465
STOP THAT.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.465
RORY AND I WILL SEE YOU

09:05.545 --> 09:08.465

09:08.507 --> 09:10.717
AND I ARE GOING SKIING,

09:10.758 --> 09:12.469
AND WE'RE GETTING

09:10.758 --> 09:12.469
A RIDICULOUSLY EARLY START.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.471
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.471
WHY RIDICULOUSLY EARLY?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.806
SHE HAS TO DRIVE

09:14.513 --> 09:16.806
FROM HER PLACE IN NEW YORK

09:16.848 --> 09:19.309
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T STAY AT

09:16.848 --> 09:19.309
MINE BECAUSE OF JESS.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.520
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE HER

09:19.351 --> 09:21.520
COME IN FRIDAY NIGHT?

09:21.561 --> 09:24.647
YOU GUYS COULD STAY HERE.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.647
IT'LL BE ON THE HOUSE.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.525
NO. THAT'S OKAY.

09:24.689 --> 09:26.525
NO. DO IT, LUKE.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.028
I KNOW WE HAVE ROOMS AVAILABLE,

09:26.566 --> 09:30.028
AND IT'S MY WAY OF SAYING,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.322
"THANKS FOR PARADING

09:30.070 --> 09:32.322

09:32.364 --> 09:34.533
JEEZ!

09:32.364 --> 09:34.533
NO KIDDING.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.533
REALLY, IT'S A GREAT BUTT.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.285
STOP IT.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.285
NO. REALLY.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.285
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.246
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.498
EITHER WAY,

09:39.287 --> 09:41.498
THANKS FOR THE OFFER.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.125
I'LL TELL MICHEL TO KEEP

09:41.540 --> 09:44.125

09:48.296 --> 09:51.632
DID YOU KNOW THAT FRANK

09:48.296 --> 09:51.632
RESCUES CHOW PUPPIES?

09:48.296 --> 09:51.632
UH, NO.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.094
HE FEEDS AND HOUSES THEM

09:51.674 --> 09:54.094
ON HIS OWN DIME

09:54.135 --> 09:56.513
TILL HE FINDS AN OWNER.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.513
WE CAN'T FIRE HIM.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.640
AND THEY ARE SO CUTE --

09:56.555 --> 09:59.640
CHIN CHIN AND PAW PAW.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.519
PAW PAW'S THE ONE WITH

09:59.682 --> 10:02.519

10:05.772 --> 10:09.276

10:05.772 --> 10:09.276
WILL YOU FIRE FRANK FOR ME?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.485
SURE THING.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.535
WITH THAT LAST FUNCTION,

10:18.577 --> 10:20.328
WE RAISED ENOUGH TO

10:18.577 --> 10:20.328
PUT US IN THE BLACK,

10:20.370 --> 10:22.372
WHICH GOT THE SCHOOL COMPTROLLER

10:20.370 --> 10:22.372
OFF OUR BACK,

10:22.414 --> 10:24.499
WHICH WILL MAKE OUR LAST

10:22.414 --> 10:24.499
ENDEAVOR THAT MUCH EASIER.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.001
HAVEN'T WE ALREADY TALKED

10:24.541 --> 10:27.001
ALL THIS STUFF TO DEATH?

10:27.043 --> 10:28.336
YES, BUT WE NEED TO FILL IN

10:28.378 --> 10:30.797

10:36.219 --> 10:37.512
GOD, THIS YEAR'S GONE BY FAST.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.389
I CAN'T BELIEVE

10:37.554 --> 10:39.389
MY FARRAH'S 18.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.682
MY KID WAS 18

10:39.431 --> 10:41.682
WHEN SHE WAS 10.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.684
MEN.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.684
WHAT?

10:43.726 --> 10:46.521
LAY LOW. THEY'RE SETTING TRAPS.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.521
WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS YEAR?

10:46.563 --> 10:48.022
WE'RE THROWING A

10:46.563 --> 10:48.022
BIG PARTY ON A YACHT.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.023

10:49.065 --> 10:50.609
THE PARTY STARTS

10:49.065 --> 10:50.609
WHILE ITS IN DOCK,

10:50.650 --> 10:53.403
IT SAILS FOR 3 HOURS, THEN

10:50.650 --> 10:53.403

HOW'S THE

10:53.445 --> 10:54.362
FUND-RAISING GOING?

10:54.404 --> 10:55.905
TERRIFIC.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.032
THE LAST FASHION SHOW ALONE

10:55.947 --> 10:58.032
BROUGHT IN HALF OF WHAT WE NEED,

10:58.074 --> 11:01.202
THE BAKE SALE TODAY BROUGHT

10:58.074 --> 11:01.202
IN WAY MORE THAN I EXPECTED.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.580
OH, THAT REMINDS ME.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.373
WHAT'S THIS?

11:03.622 --> 11:05.373

BEFORE YOU REACHED,

11:07.459 --> 11:09.377
WE VOTED, YOU WON.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.547
MAYBE THERE SHOULD BE A RECOUNT,

11:09.419 --> 11:12.547
'CAUSE I STINK WITH MONEY.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.714
THE VOTE WAS UNANIMOUS.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.425
I WAS LATE.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.425
CAN WE REVOTE?

11:15.467 --> 11:17.802
DOUG WAS LATE, TOO,

17:48.359 --> 17:50.820
HOW'S IT LOOK OUT THERE?

17:48.359 --> 17:50.820
LIKE YOU'RE GONNA BULLET

17:50.862 --> 17:53.072
STRAIGHT TO THE TOP

17:50.862 --> 17:53.072
OF THE CHARTS WITH A BULLET

17:53.113 --> 17:55.033
OR A-A GUN'S GONNA

17:53.113 --> 17:55.033
SHOOT A BULLET

17:55.074 --> 17:58.118
AND I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH

17:55.074 --> 17:58.118
THE PRECISE TERMINOLOGY,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.286
BUT IT'S WORKING, RIGHT?

17:59.328 --> 18:01.581
THEY LOOK LIKE A BAND.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.581
YOU NEED TO MOVE BACK.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.624
WHY?

18:01.622 --> 18:03.624
BECAUSE WHEN I

18:01.622 --> 18:03.624

18:06.168 --> 18:09.047
WELL, DON'T DO THAT THEN.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.047
IT SOUNDS A LITTLE

18:06.168 --> 18:09.047
TOO MILLI VANILLI.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.258
IF I BACK UP, MY EXTENSION CORD

18:09.088 --> 18:12.258
MIGHT DAMAGE THE DATE PALM.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.718
WHAT?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.718
THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.095
DON'T CALL PLANTS

18:13.760 --> 18:16.095
BY THEIR SPECIFIC NAMES.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.849
IT'S VERY NOT ROCK 'N' ROLL.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.849
LET'S FINALIZE

18:16.136 --> 18:19.849

18:34.154 --> 18:37.533
HEY. DID I HEAR SOMETHING

18:34.154 --> 18:37.533
