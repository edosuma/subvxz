WEBVTT

00:18.105 --> 00:19.193
- Oh, whoa.
God, sorry. Sorry.

00:19.236 --> 00:20.281
No, no, no.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.325
I was just gonna
brush my teeth.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.457
- Yeah, me too.
- No, it's okay.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.372
You can go ahead.
No, really, go.

00:24.415 --> 00:27.723
Okay, just wait here.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.423
- It's all yours.
- Are you sure 'cause--

00:32.467 --> 00:34.208
Yeah, yeah, no, I insist.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.951
Toothpaste.

01:09.895 --> 01:13.203
- Excuse me.
I'm looking for the owner.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.699
- Hello.
Um...Oh.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.353
- Are you the guy
with the Jeep?

01:32.396 --> 01:34.355
No, yeah, sorry.

01:34.398 --> 01:38.750
I'm looking
for Horace Reynolds.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.144
And you are?

01:41.188 --> 01:43.059
I'm Floyd.

01:47.324 --> 01:48.978
- Okay, this is where
he sent the last check,

01:49.021 --> 01:50.501
but it's old.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.416
I bought this place from
your pops, like, ten years ago.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.157
- Thank you.
No, this is great.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.463
Thanks.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.421
- Hey, look, I heard
he got really sick.

01:57.465 --> 01:58.857
Don't know
if he ever recovered.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.816
I'm sorry.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.783
- You like it?
- Oh, my...

02:11.827 --> 02:15.222
Martin Eugene McIntyre,
I love it.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.354
- Great,
I was walking down 8th Avenue,

02:17.398 --> 02:18.964
I saw it in a window,

02:19.008 --> 02:21.358
and it reminded me of the one
you had on the night we met.

02:21.402 --> 02:24.144
- Oh, the one that I spilled
beer all over, you mean?

02:24.187 --> 02:26.146
- Uh, tequila.
- Right.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.365
God, I was so neurotic.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.628
What are you still doing here?

02:30.672 --> 02:33.892
- I see all the work
you're putting in.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.068
All the little things.

02:36.112 --> 02:39.289
The coffee you make me,
your work with Dr. Rieger.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.813
- Mm.
- You're trying to fix it.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.425
- Us.
- Yeah.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.123
- I think we're getting back
to where we started.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.130
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.352
I am but hours away

02:58.395 --> 03:01.616
from catching that
magical red-eye to Heathrow.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.661
- Magical is not quite
the word I would use,

03:03.705 --> 03:04.749
but I'll take it.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.360
- Had a few hours,
thought I'd call

03:06.403 --> 03:07.622
and help out
with the wedding planning.

03:07.665 --> 03:10.625
- Oh, you do know
what to say to a lady.

03:10.668 --> 03:11.974
<i>- You know, our romance</i>
<i>has just been</i>

03:12.017 --> 03:14.542
<i>so fly by the seat</i>
<i>of our pants.</i>

03:14.585 --> 03:16.239
I thought the our wedding

03:16.283 --> 03:17.501
should be the opposite,
you know?

03:17.545 --> 03:19.895
Thought out, considerate.

03:19.938 --> 03:21.549
I completely agree.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.204
How do you feel about castles?

03:24.247 --> 03:25.683
- Castles.
I love castles.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.077
- Is this a random question?
- No.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.470
My parents got married

03:29.513 --> 03:31.472
in a registrar's office
in Leicestershire.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.213
No dress, no ring.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.518
It was like they
bumped into each other

03:34.562 --> 03:36.259
just queuing for driver's
permits and thought,

03:36.303 --> 03:37.391
"Well, we're here.
We might as well."

03:37.434 --> 03:40.394
- Yeah, so what
are you thinking?

03:40.437 --> 03:45.268
- I'm thinking the Hereford
Court Estate and Gardens.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.966
It is this beautiful
15th century castle

03:48.010 --> 03:50.839
nestled in 500 acres
of Herefordshire countryside.

03:50.882 --> 03:52.580
Mina and I are
going to go see it today.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.538
- Sold,
sounds so over the top,

03:54.582 --> 03:57.193
it might just match
how much I love you.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.586
I love you too.

03:58.629 --> 04:02.285
- Can't wait to grow old
and gray with you.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.113
- I can't wait
to grow old with you.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.593
Gray?
Mm-mm, not so much.

04:05.636 --> 04:09.074
That's a lot of gray.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.381
- Max?
Babe?

04:11.425 --> 04:12.861
- Hey, sorry.
I'm just doing math.

04:12.904 --> 04:14.732
I'm gonna call you right back.
Hey, what's happening?

04:14.776 --> 04:17.344
- The elder care facility
on Roosevelt Island shut down,

04:17.387 --> 04:18.910
and we're absorbing
all their residents.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.172
All?

04:20.216 --> 04:21.565
Can we handle
that many intakes?

04:21.609 --> 04:23.132
- Every other city
and medical director said no.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.743
And New Amsterdam said yes?

04:25.787 --> 04:27.528
- We don't have
a medical director.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.099
Keys, phone.

04:37.407 --> 04:40.280
Oh, no, Mina.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.421
Mm-mm.
Don't do it.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.858
Stop that.
Don't, Helen.

04:53.902 --> 04:56.165
Just put the phone away.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.342
No, put it--

04:59.386 --> 05:01.388
okay, well, you're just gonna
disappoint yourself,

05:01.431 --> 05:03.346
then you're gonna
ruin it and...

05:03.390 --> 05:06.784
Mom, hi.
What are you doing today?

05:09.961 --> 05:11.659
- We should go on diversion.
- No.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.182
- We're out of beds.
- I've got a plan.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.836
- Just found three more
wandering the halls.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.185
I said I've got a plan, okay?

05:16.228 --> 05:18.143
This is an ED.
They don't all need to be here.

05:18.187 --> 05:21.799
- I'm going to Hawaii.
- We treat and we transfer.

05:21.843 --> 05:23.018
- So how many
did they dump on us?

05:23.061 --> 05:24.367
Us?

05:24.411 --> 05:25.760
Aren't you supposed to be
on a plane right now?

05:25.803 --> 05:27.327
Unless you want to be
the new medical director.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.459
- I'm just a concerned citizen
who's offering to help.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.939
Okay, well, in that case,

05:30.982 --> 05:33.637
welcome to "The Best Exotic
Marigold Hotel" in my ED.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.726
- Yo, you paged?
- Yes, yes, I did.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.989
Okay, so you see these five
elderly patients over here?

05:38.033 --> 05:41.123
They are all candidates
for surgical procedures,

05:41.166 --> 05:42.342
and last time I checked,

05:42.385 --> 05:43.647
you were still the chair
of surgery.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.562
- So get to cutting, bub.
- Well, now, hang on.

05:45.606 --> 05:46.868
- Put me in, coach.
I'm ready to play.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.522
- Nice sweater.
- Thank you, yeah.

05:48.565 --> 05:50.001
- I don't care.
I don't care.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.786
So I need you to take
these people up to your floor.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.701
- They're all depressed.
- And you know that how?

05:53.744 --> 05:56.094
- They live in a nursing home.
- I'm going to Hawaii.

05:56.138 --> 05:58.183
Just find them a new home.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.229
Can't you just be
the interim medical director?

06:00.272 --> 06:02.362
- I already told Karen no,
but the search committee's

06:02.405 --> 06:04.015
gonna find you someone amazing.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.669
It just won't be me.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.629
- Well, as long
as we're all pitching in.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.326
- Mr. Wallace.
- Hmm.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.111
- Mr. Wallace,
meet Dr. Goodwin.

06:13.155 --> 06:15.897
- How can I help?
- How the hell should I know?

06:15.940 --> 06:19.683
You're the doctor.
You tell me.

06:19.727 --> 06:22.686
- The patients in these files
were all denied surgery

06:22.730 --> 06:26.777
at other hospitals
solely because of their age.

06:26.821 --> 06:29.911
Guess what?
That's ageism.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.608
Plain and simple.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.524
Now, that might fly at other
hospitals, but not mine.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.787
These patients
want these surgeries,

06:36.831 --> 06:38.354
they need these surgeries,

06:38.398 --> 06:39.790
and we're
gonna make it happen.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.619
Now, I will be performing
Mr. Lewis' osteotomy.

06:42.663 --> 06:45.492
- Wait, all these surgeries
are happening today?

06:45.535 --> 06:47.755
- After being placed
on hold for months and,

06:47.798 --> 06:49.757
in some cases,
years--just imagine

06:49.800 --> 06:53.238
that this is your father
or your grandmother.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.719
Hell, I have to fight tooth
and nail to get my mother

06:55.763 --> 06:57.547
the care she needs,
and I know the system.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.550
These patients
have waited long enough.

07:00.594 --> 07:03.597
Any questions or concerns?

07:03.640 --> 07:05.555
You are the boss.

07:05.599 --> 07:08.906
- I just wedged Mr. Jackson
into bay 27.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.604
- I thought Lottie Carlson
was 27.

07:10.647 --> 07:11.909
- She was surprisingly
fine with it.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.345
Okay, so come on.
What are we at?

07:13.389 --> 07:15.304
- What are the numbers?
- We've placed 17 patients.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.741
- Well, that's pretty good.
- We have 46 to go.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.440
God, I take that back.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.399
Excuse me.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.489
- I asked
for hot tea with lemon.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.925
- Yes, we're gonna get
right on that.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.274
If you could just
get back to your...

07:29.318 --> 07:30.754
Does this feel hot to you?

07:30.798 --> 07:34.715
Uh...I would call it tepid.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.586
- Yes.
- Mrs. Lew, please.

07:36.630 --> 07:39.589
- I'm just an old lady
with a sore throat.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.330
- I'm begging for help.
- All right, okay.

07:41.373 --> 07:44.594
I'm gonna take a look.
Come on.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.641
Okay.
Open your mouth.

07:54.430 --> 07:56.824
It's strep throat, right?

07:56.867 --> 07:58.608
Oh, God.

07:58.652 --> 08:01.263
Lottie and Patricia
got it last week,

08:01.306 --> 08:03.265
and Reuben's got it now.

08:03.308 --> 08:08.183
Rhonda, Sheila,
it's really going around.

08:19.368 --> 08:23.067
- Mrs. Lew has gonorrhea.
- Didn't see that coming.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.809
- Okay, shut the doors and
divert all level one traumas.

08:25.853 --> 08:29.073
Well, your wish came true.
We have a gonorrhea outbreak.

08:29.117 --> 08:32.381
- To be clear,
that wasn't my wish.

08:35.210 --> 08:39.649
And there is that.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.651
After a month or so,

08:41.695 --> 08:43.610
Mr. Lewis will be back
with his bridge club.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.829
No pain, no pills.

08:45.873 --> 08:47.265
- I'm sure
he'll appreciate that.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.832
I would at 87.

08:48.876 --> 08:51.182
- Listen, it's why we do
what we do, right?

08:51.226 --> 08:54.664
And to think, some surgeon said
that he's too old.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.100
- Sorry, Dr. Reynolds.
- Yes.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.538
- If we're done, OR 4 needs
three units of O-pos.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.322
- All right, no problem.
They can have it.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.063
We're good.
Suction.

09:02.106 --> 09:03.717
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Yeah, over here.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.719
- OR 3 needs
a spare set of hands.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.504
- Aren't there
any available scrub nurses?

09:08.548 --> 09:11.594
- There were, but there seems
to be some sort of problem.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.596
<i>- Any available surgeon</i>
<i>to OR 2.</i>

09:13.640 --> 09:14.902
<i>Any available surgeon to OR 2.</i>

09:14.945 --> 09:16.643
- Excuse me
while I check on it.

09:18.819 --> 09:22.213
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

09:22.257 --> 09:25.913
<i>- Any available surgeon</i>
<i>to OR 2, 3, and 6.</i>

09:25.956 --> 09:29.569
<i>Repeat, we need a surgeon</i>
<i>in OR 2, 3, and 6.</i>

09:29.612 --> 09:32.136
<i>Any available surgeon, stat.</i>

09:39.361 --> 09:39.535
.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.146
- As you can see,
our attention to detail

09:42.190 --> 09:45.454
at Hereford Court
is unparalleled.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.978
Of course,
you and your wedding party

09:48.022 --> 09:50.459
would have full use
of the grounds.

09:50.502 --> 09:55.638
A lovely chamber quartet,
five-course tasting menu,

09:55.682 --> 09:58.641
livery service for arrivals.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.295
What's a livery service?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.514
- For those arriving
on horseback.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.300
Oh, dear God.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.476
- Mum.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.522
Mum, this is important to me,

10:10.566 --> 10:12.481
which is why
I invited you, but...

10:12.524 --> 10:14.744
- What?
So I can't ask questions?

10:14.788 --> 10:20.097
- We've left the castle
exquisitely unchanged.

10:21.533 --> 10:24.798
Some things really do
stand the test of time.

10:24.841 --> 10:28.018
- You ask me, people
getting married in castles

10:28.062 --> 10:30.368
are over-compensating
for something.

10:30.412 --> 10:34.111
- Fiona, tell me.
Does the estate have a dungeon?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.678
Yes, it does,

10:35.722 --> 10:38.986
but unfortunately
it's off-limits to guests.

10:39.029 --> 10:42.076
Oh, that is unfortunate.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.346
Yo, fill me in.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.217
I resected a pancreatic tumor

10:53.261 --> 10:55.176
with an extension
into the liver.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.743
And what's the problem?

10:56.786 --> 10:58.135
I can't close the liver

10:58.179 --> 10:59.659
because I can't get
the bleeding under control.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.530
And every stitch
is pulling through

11:01.573 --> 11:02.923
because the tissue
is too friable,

11:02.966 --> 11:04.707
which is probably the reason

11:04.751 --> 11:08.537
Ms. James' surgery was denied
in the first place.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.496
- We'll see about that.
All right, I'm tagging in.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.585
Suture.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.633
- Okay, Vic,
you want to tell me

11:17.677 --> 11:19.243
what medications
you're taking lately?

11:19.287 --> 11:21.550
Hand me my bag.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.206
- Thank you.
- No problem.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.469
Now, let me see here.

11:27.512 --> 11:32.692
Dr. Lockhard prescribes
amlodipine besylate

11:32.735 --> 11:34.476
for my hypertension.

11:34.519 --> 11:39.873
Dr. Lee gives me levothyroxine
for my hypothyroidism.

11:39.916 --> 11:45.052
Dr. Wheeler gives me
omeprazole for my reflux.

11:45.095 --> 11:49.056
And Dr. Brennan gives me

11:49.099 --> 11:51.754
some simvastatin
for my high cholesterol.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.103
- You got a whole pharmacy
in there.

11:54.322 --> 11:55.802
- Listen, here's
what I'm thinking.

11:55.845 --> 11:59.414
- I'm also taking prednisone
on Mondays,

11:59.457 --> 12:02.809
azathioprine
every other Tuesday,

12:02.852 --> 12:08.423
diclofenac sodium as needed,
and tramadol.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.555
- Am I pronouncing that right?
- Yeah.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.383
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.472
- That's okay.
- Oh.

12:14.516 --> 12:17.127
Okay, it's all right.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.782
And you have
rheumatoid arthritis.

12:19.826 --> 12:23.786
Yeah, it's miserable.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.747
Nothing makes my hands
stop swelling.

12:27.790 --> 12:32.839
Oh, and there's adalimumab
on Fridays.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.320
Let me see what else.

12:36.364 --> 12:38.758
- Hi, I'll be right back.
Yes, hi.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.629
- Nurse Gene from
South Point Nursing Center.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.239
- Oh, am I glad to see you.
Oh, my God.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.458
We are bursting
at the seams here.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.546
We got the transport outside.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.677
I'll get them all resettled

12:45.721 --> 12:47.070
and get the paperwork
sent back, okay?

12:47.114 --> 12:48.724
- Please, thank you
to your team from me, okay?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.899
You just did.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.640
Did I tell you I'm flying

12:51.683 --> 12:55.078
to Hawaii tomorrow
for a long vacation?

12:55.122 --> 12:59.039
- Oh, now, are you going to
the Big Island, Mrs. Boulton?

12:59.082 --> 13:00.910
- Yes, I am.
- Yes, she is.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.347
- It's supposed to be
beautiful this time of year.

13:03.391 --> 13:05.088
- Oh, good
with this population, huh?

13:05.132 --> 13:06.611
- Oh, now,
hey, these are my guys.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.309
- Got Big Wally here.
Big Walt.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.353
- Hey, now.
- Yeah.

13:09.397 --> 13:11.051
- Hold on a second.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.443
- You got him?
You okay?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.794
You all right?
Need a sec?

13:14.837 --> 13:17.231
- Just my asthma.
- Your asthma.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.061
No, no, no.
Asthma doesn't look like this.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.846
You know, Gene, I think
you're having a panic attack.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.500
Come, now, come in my office.
It's okay.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.588
Take a second.
Take a second.

13:26.631 --> 13:27.850
Come on.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.678
- All right,
well, the good news is,

13:29.721 --> 13:31.680
is that gonorrhea can
be treated with one shot.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.335
So we just have to talk to them

13:34.378 --> 13:36.728
and figure out
who needs it, okay?

13:47.870 --> 13:49.654
- Ms. Forsheim,
we need to talk to you

13:49.698 --> 13:51.482
about your sexual activity.

13:51.526 --> 13:54.050
- Where do you get off
asking a question like that?

13:54.094 --> 13:55.922
And are you sexually active?

13:55.965 --> 13:57.880
I wouldn't call it active.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.361
I mostly just lay there,

14:00.404 --> 14:03.190
and I'm happy
with a little kissing

14:03.233 --> 14:05.061
and touching.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.369
If it happens, it happens.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.371
- I haven't had sex
in 30 years,

14:10.414 --> 14:12.460
unless you count oral.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.244
How about sexual partners?

14:14.288 --> 14:16.725
- I had only been
with one other man

14:16.768 --> 14:21.556
before my Jerry passed,
but life goes on, yeah?

14:21.599 --> 14:23.253
And why should I tell you

14:23.297 --> 14:24.907
what goes on
when the lights go out?

14:24.951 --> 14:28.389
- And do you use protection?
- From who?

14:28.432 --> 14:31.218
- Condom?
Where would I get a condom?

14:31.261 --> 14:33.873
Oh, I don't do condoms.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.224
At my age,
I got enough problems

14:37.267 --> 14:39.530
getting this boat in the water.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.489
- Well, maybe you'd be
more comfortable

14:41.532 --> 14:44.405
if we all just played
shuffleboard till we died.

14:44.448 --> 14:45.928
We're just trying to help.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.409
- By embarrassing people?
- No, that's not--

14:48.452 --> 14:50.759
I haven't had sex in years.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.804
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.808
This interview is over.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.295
- Dr. Wilder,
BP 78 over 42, dropping.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.949
- Drop to 3-0 vicryl.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.777
- No, no, no.
I already tried that.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.300
- Well, what if I do
a purse string suture?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.780
- Another unit
of blood coming in.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.434
- Yeah, what I'm thinking
is I take this tissue here,

15:13.477 --> 15:15.001
and I pull it together
with that suture.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.307
And then you can come in
and cauterize the edges.

15:17.351 --> 15:20.136
- Yeah?
- Let's do it.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.616
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Yes.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.661
- So sorry.
You're needed in OR 3.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.098
I'm kind of busy right now.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.316
I know, but it's

15:26.360 --> 15:27.622
Dr. Nottingham's patient,
Mrs. Bennett.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.406
- She's in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

15:29.450 --> 15:31.365
- I think you better see
for yourself.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.802
Go, I've got it.

15:33.845 --> 15:36.457
- Oh, God.
I mean, all these patients.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.896
I mean, they all needed
these surgeries, right?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.506
Dr. Reynolds.

15:48.338 --> 15:48.773
.

15:48.817 --> 15:51.646
- I'll let you and your mother
take in the bridal suite,

15:51.689 --> 15:54.823
and I'll pop right back
with contracts and champagne.

15:57.826 --> 16:01.003
- She's gonna pop back
with champagne, Mum.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.831
You really ought to cheer up.

16:02.874 --> 16:06.052
- You'll need it,
what this is gonna cost you.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.055
- Do you know what,
I am curious,

16:09.098 --> 16:12.406
if you were just gonna be
miserable the whole time,

16:12.449 --> 16:14.147
then why did you want to come?

16:14.190 --> 16:17.541
- I didn't want to.
You asked me.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.501
- Because I thought,
mistakenly,

16:20.544 --> 16:24.940
that for once, you just
might want to see me happy.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.376
Happy?

16:26.420 --> 16:27.551
Where do you think the money

16:27.595 --> 16:30.250
that built this place
came from?

16:30.293 --> 16:33.949
The backs of your ancestors,
that's where.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.561
Sugar plantations.
Colonial slavery.

16:39.694 --> 16:43.089
When that woman tells the story

16:43.132 --> 16:47.093
of the lord and lady
who built this place...

16:47.136 --> 16:50.792
I'm sorry, but I don't
hear timeless love.

16:50.835 --> 16:53.099
I hear something
very different,

16:53.142 --> 16:56.493
and of all people,
why couldn't you?

16:56.537 --> 16:58.495
I thought that...

16:58.539 --> 17:02.064
- You thought you deserved
a fairy tale in a castle

17:02.108 --> 17:05.633
with that man and his daughter.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.983
If it's a fairy tale you want,

17:08.027 --> 17:10.246
it's a fairy tale you'll get.

17:15.599 --> 17:20.517
- Okay, Vic, I think
I have got some great news.

17:22.128 --> 17:25.696
I think I got a way to cut
that suitcase of pills in half.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.220
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.744
Thing is, you've been seen
by a whole host of doctors,

17:29.787 --> 17:31.311
each one treating you
for a different ailment,

17:31.354 --> 17:34.009
and nobody is communicating
with each other.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.012
But now, unfortunately for you,
you're stuck with me,

17:37.056 --> 17:40.929
and I think I've got a way
to streamline that regiment.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.671
That means no more
bags of pills,

17:43.714 --> 17:45.368
no more dozens of doctors.

17:48.197 --> 17:52.288
- And will my hands
finally stop swelling up?

17:52.332 --> 17:54.856
- Well, no,
that will still unfortunately

17:54.899 --> 17:58.425
be a side effect.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.824
- We--have you got
one of those smartphones?

18:06.868 --> 18:08.478
Sure.

18:08.522 --> 18:11.916
Look up Carnegie Hall

18:11.960 --> 18:17.400
December 12, 1973.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.228
Okay.

18:30.065 --> 18:33.242
- This is you?
- It was.

18:35.201 --> 18:39.030
I haven't played
for over a decade,

18:39.074 --> 18:41.685
ever since
the arthritis got bad.

18:41.729 --> 18:45.298
Vic, you're amazing.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.389
You ever been in love?

18:49.432 --> 18:52.435
I'm about to get married.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.176
- Oh.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.397
Playing was the love
of my life.

18:57.440 --> 19:01.749
I still dream
about it every night.

19:01.792 --> 19:04.447
My fingertips
touching the ivory,

19:04.491 --> 19:08.495
teasing out the melody.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.932
And every doctor I go to,

19:10.975 --> 19:13.282
they just see me
as some old guy

19:13.326 --> 19:18.505
with symptoms
that need to be treated.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.376
And I always ask them,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.944
can they help
my hands stop swelling?

19:22.987 --> 19:29.080
Every time,
and nobody ever listens.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.648
Not even you, Dr. Goodwin.

19:40.483 --> 19:42.355
- I got to get back out there.
I got my residents.

19:42.398 --> 19:43.834
- No, no, no, no,
they're with a nurse,

19:43.878 --> 19:45.271
and, my friend,
they're not the ones

19:45.314 --> 19:46.968
dealing with
a pressing medical issue.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.275
- Oh, come on.
Let's not get melodramatic.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.364
- Talking to the wrong guy,
I'm afraid.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.192
All right, sit.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.455
What happens if you have one
of these panic attacks

19:55.498 --> 19:57.587
when you're physically
supporting one of them, huh?

19:57.631 --> 19:59.633
Or while you're driving?

19:59.676 --> 20:02.810
- So what, this is
some kind of a stress thing?

20:02.853 --> 20:04.464
- I don't know.
Is it?

20:04.507 --> 20:06.379
- So now I'm
in a therapy session.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.163
- No, Gene,
I'm not your therapist.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.644
Genuinely, I'm just a concerned
medical professional

20:10.687 --> 20:12.472
chatting with another one.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.343
That's it, I promise.

20:14.387 --> 20:17.041
- Okay, you're good.
You got me.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.741
My wife and I
have been fighting.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.308
Okay, what about?

20:22.351 --> 20:25.485
- Chores, kids, money,
you name it.

20:25.528 --> 20:29.010
- We run the whole jukebox.

20:29.053 --> 20:33.188
- She says I'm not showing up
like I should.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.190
- All right,
well, do you think you are?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.716
All right, never mind.
What do you do to feel good?

20:39.760 --> 20:43.067
You know, how do you find
relief from these feelings?

20:43.111 --> 20:45.853
- Well, that one's easy.
My job.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.072
Tell me.

20:48.116 --> 20:51.075
I mean, I love it.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.164
A lot of nurses
won't work elder care.

20:53.208 --> 20:55.384
Too depressing, underpaid,

20:55.428 --> 20:59.519
but I went to geriatrics
straight out of nursing school.

20:59.562 --> 21:03.349
Some of the folks I work with,
their families don't visit.

21:03.392 --> 21:07.918
They're totally alone,
but they got me.

21:07.962 --> 21:09.442
I get to help them smile.

21:09.485 --> 21:12.662
I keep them fed,
bathed, and clean.

21:12.706 --> 21:17.319
I--yeah, yeah, the hours suck,

21:17.363 --> 21:21.454
but every day I see
how much it means to them.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.239
And whether they know it
or not,

21:24.283 --> 21:26.633
it means even more to me.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.939
That's nice.

21:28.983 --> 21:31.202
No, that's good.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.204
I just--I think I know
what you need to do

21:33.248 --> 21:34.902
to get rid
of these panic attacks.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.730
What's that?

21:39.254 --> 21:40.864
You need to quit your job.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.393
That was mortifying.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.786
In Pakistan, we don't
ask elders such things.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.353
- Right,
and that's the problem.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.746
I mean, no one's
talking about it,

21:52.789 --> 21:55.575
no one's asking about it,
and everyone's got VD.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.228
It's like I'm
back in high school.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.013
- What high school
did you go to?

21:59.056 --> 22:02.712
- I need back up!
I need back up!

22:02.756 --> 22:05.149
- Okay, what do we got?
- She's crashing.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.108
Unresponsive,
respiratory rate 40.

22:07.151 --> 22:08.283
- All right,
she's gasping for air.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.241
- Lungs clear?
- Yes.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.895
- Allergic reaction?
- No and no pneumonia.

22:11.939 --> 22:14.071
All right.

22:14.115 --> 22:15.421
All right, there's an abscess,

22:15.464 --> 22:16.770
and it's blocking off
her airway.

22:16.813 --> 22:18.032
- We need
to get her into surgery.

22:18.075 --> 22:19.642
No time.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.821
Suction.

22:28.172 --> 22:30.044
- What?

22:30.087 --> 22:32.351
It's gonorrhea.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.178
- She said she hadn't
had sex in years.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.703
Well, she lied.

22:36.746 --> 22:39.053
- What do we got?
- Carotid endarterectomy.

22:39.096 --> 22:40.794
Can you sew in
the distal anastomosis?

22:40.837 --> 22:44.188
- Okay, clamp this, needle.
How much time?

22:44.232 --> 22:45.538
- Two and half minutes
to finish

22:45.581 --> 22:46.974
or risking permanent
brain damage.

22:47.017 --> 22:49.193
- You're just now telling me?
Suction.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.457
Come on, come on.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.373
- CTA shows stenosis
in the Circle of Willis.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.157
- That explains why
there's no retrograde filling.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.419
You see why the small window.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.116
I do.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.901
- Why didn't you push back?
- Excuse me?

23:00.944 --> 23:01.989
- If this surgery
was a mistake,

23:02.032 --> 23:02.990
why didn't you tell me?

23:03.033 --> 23:04.078
- You're chair.
You're the boss.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.647
Time.

23:07.690 --> 23:08.952
1 minute, 45 left.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.650
Come on.

23:10.693 --> 23:11.955
Almost there.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.479
Okay, there.
Got blood flow.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.481
What now?

23:15.524 --> 23:17.483
- Dr. Flores' patient
is crashing.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.094
- You got this?
- Do I have a choice?

23:30.931 --> 23:31.105
.

24:23.244 --> 24:27.074
- All right, Vic,
now I've really got great news.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.989
- Where have I heard
that before?

24:29.032 --> 24:33.080
- That's fair, but I found you
a steroid injection.

24:33.123 --> 24:36.431
It's gonna increase mobility
in your fingers.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.434
So the swelling will stop?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.871
Yes, but at a cost.

24:41.915 --> 24:44.178
The steroid's gonna interact
with other medications

24:44.221 --> 24:46.093
that you're on,
creating more side effects,

24:46.136 --> 24:48.661
which may not be
entirely pleasant.

24:51.707 --> 24:56.538
- But will I be able
to play again?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.540
Yes.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.460
Oh.

25:16.253 --> 25:19.605
- We need to talk about your
sexual activity, Ms. Forsheim.

25:19.648 --> 25:22.433
- There's nothing
to talk about.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.523
Just give me the medicine.

25:24.566 --> 25:28.309
- Right, so it doesn't bother
you that you nearly died

25:28.352 --> 25:31.965
because you refused to admit
that you were having sex.

25:32.008 --> 25:35.316
This is how venereal diseases
kill people.

25:35.359 --> 25:37.579
Please.

25:37.623 --> 25:41.583
Look, it's all very well and
good for young people like you

25:41.627 --> 25:44.107
to talk about your sex lives
to anyone who'll listen,

25:44.151 --> 25:47.937
but where I come from,
women who had sex

25:47.981 --> 25:52.289
out of wedlock were called
all sorts of nasty things.

25:52.333 --> 25:58.557
And now we get laughed at
even at the care home.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.081
- They knew you were having sex
at the care home?

26:01.124 --> 26:04.345
- Of course they knew.
They think it's a hoot.

26:06.303 --> 26:09.655
I don't need to be
anybody's punchline.

26:09.698 --> 26:12.396
Not at my age.

26:12.440 --> 26:16.139
- Sandy, look,
no one is asking you

26:16.183 --> 26:17.924
to go public
with your sex life.

26:17.967 --> 26:19.578
But if you are having sex,

26:19.621 --> 26:21.841
then you do need to face up
to the medical realities.

26:21.884 --> 26:25.235
You mean well, I can tell,

26:25.279 --> 26:29.892
but I'd rather just
not be intimate again

26:29.936 --> 26:32.416
than talk about it
with strangers.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.208
I can't quit my job.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.689
- No, you can.
You don't want to.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.560
- Were you listening?
- Yeah.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.171
My job is my calling.

26:48.215 --> 26:51.697
I work long hours
because people need me.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.394
No, people need a nurse.

26:53.437 --> 26:55.570
- They need a nurse
who gives a crap.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.965
Doctors like you think
every nurse is the same.

26:59.008 --> 27:02.533
- You have no idea.
- All right, answer me this.

27:02.577 --> 27:05.014
How many residents
do you see on a shift?

27:05.058 --> 27:07.626
Just ballpark it.
Give me a number.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.845
20.

27:09.889 --> 27:12.065
- What was that number
five years ago?

27:12.108 --> 27:13.327
Eight.

27:13.370 --> 27:14.807
Look, man, everyone
is dealing with this.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.678
We're in the middle
of a national nursing shortage.

27:16.722 --> 27:17.940
- No, we're not.
Incorrect.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.202
There are more trained nurses

27:19.246 --> 27:21.509
in this country right now
than ever before.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.598
Institutions aren't hiring them
because they know

27:23.642 --> 27:27.167
that short-staffing nurses is
a great way to make more money.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.734
That's it.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.344
I've been trying
to hire for months.

27:30.387 --> 27:32.389
HCC is blocking me
left, right, and center

27:32.433 --> 27:33.477
because they know,

27:33.521 --> 27:36.045
you screw over a doctor,
they leave.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.613
Screw over a patient, they die.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.269
You screw over nurses,

27:42.312 --> 27:44.271
they're gonna stay on the job

27:44.314 --> 27:47.622
because for them,
it's not a job,

27:47.666 --> 27:49.145
it's a calling.

27:51.452 --> 27:57.327
This profession that you love
does not love you back.

27:57.371 --> 28:00.635
- That doesn't change the fact
that right now

28:00.679 --> 28:04.813
there are five patients
downstairs waiting for my help.

28:04.857 --> 28:06.772
- I've gotta go.
- You're doing it again.

28:06.815 --> 28:08.469
You're denying
what you know to be true

28:08.512 --> 28:10.297
because you think
someone needs your help.

28:10.340 --> 28:13.082
What about you?
When does somebody help you?

28:13.126 --> 28:15.476
When does Gene get help?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.785
Gene, Gene, wait, hey, hey.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.482
You're not
wearing scrubs today.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.789
Why is that?

28:27.009 --> 28:29.403
Today was my day off.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.585
Yeah.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.505
- Come on, let's go home.
- Helen, listen.

28:44.548 --> 28:48.335
And I mean this.
I'm sorry if I got in the way.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.515
When you were a girl,

28:54.558 --> 28:57.910
your cousins would
play princess.

28:57.953 --> 29:01.087
The big fairy tale wedding,
you know?

29:01.130 --> 29:04.873
- Imagining castles and princes.
- I remember.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.354
Mm.

29:07.397 --> 29:09.225
Remember what you were doing?

29:13.186 --> 29:17.538
You'd be off in the corner
dissecting your poor dolls.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.368
They needed those surgeries.

29:24.850 --> 29:28.027
- Well, I knew
you felt left out.

29:28.070 --> 29:31.030
I know you wanted those things.

29:31.073 --> 29:34.381
At least you wanted
to want those things.

29:34.424 --> 29:37.819
If you want
to have your wedding here,

29:37.863 --> 29:40.561
then have your wedding here.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.435
Okay?

29:45.479 --> 29:49.831
Because you deserve everything.

29:57.621 --> 30:00.581
- I don't want
to have my wedding here.

30:05.194 --> 30:07.762
I don't know if I want
a wedding at all.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.078
Coming through.

30:19.121 --> 30:21.732
- Increase the joules.
Going again.

30:21.776 --> 30:23.952
- Clear.
- What happened?

30:23.996 --> 30:26.128
- Still pulses v-tach.
I got nothing.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.827
I got nothing, Dr. Bloom.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.480
Time of death, 1:52.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.700
I was just with him.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.310
- He was fine.
- Max.

30:34.354 --> 30:38.010
- I changed his meds.
- He had a brain aneurysm.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.621
No change in meds
could've done this.

30:40.664 --> 30:41.883
It was just his time.

30:44.973 --> 30:47.062
- Hold, hold.

30:47.106 --> 30:48.411
We got to hurry.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.848
- Almost done
with the first suture.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.197
Okay, resuming compressions.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.851
Okay, suture's holding.

30:52.894 --> 30:56.158
Going again.
One, two, hold.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.812
- I'm sorry
I put you through this.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.293
- Don't apologize to me,
apologize to Ms. Keller

31:00.336 --> 31:01.860
if she makes it through this.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.296
- Dr. Reynolds.
- Not now.

31:03.339 --> 31:04.732
- But OR--
- You heard me.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.647
Whose ever patient is crashing,
I can't help them.

31:06.690 --> 31:08.431
It's yours.

31:12.609 --> 31:12.783
.

31:12.827 --> 31:15.090
- You close to bypass?
Tell me you got it.

31:15.134 --> 31:16.657
- Come on, come on.
- Handle your business.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.354
I've got this, go.

31:23.446 --> 31:25.448
- Watch out.
Heads up.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.235
Bleeding's under control.

31:29.278 --> 31:32.107
Plate is in place.

31:32.151 --> 31:34.153
- If you're ready to close,
Dr. Reynolds,

31:34.196 --> 31:35.894
we'd be happy to assist.

31:35.937 --> 31:39.332
- What about your patients?
- They're stable.

31:41.551 --> 31:44.467
Okay.

31:44.511 --> 31:46.861
"I recently had
a hip replacement.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.559
Can I still have safe sex?"

31:49.603 --> 31:52.040
The answer is, yes, you can.

31:52.084 --> 31:53.737
Some positions
are gonna be better

31:53.781 --> 31:55.957
and feel better than others,

31:56.001 --> 31:59.830
but that's gonna be different
for everyone, so...

31:59.874 --> 32:03.051
Tough crowd.
Okay.

32:04.966 --> 32:08.448
"Is there any reason
to still use condoms?"

32:08.491 --> 32:10.754
Look, growing up,
I always used condoms

32:10.798 --> 32:12.756
because public messaging
drilled it into me

32:12.800 --> 32:15.455
that if I didn't,
I was gonna get pregnant.

32:15.498 --> 32:17.413
Now, if today has
taught us nothing else,

32:17.457 --> 32:19.633
it has taught us that safe sex

32:19.676 --> 32:22.941
does not mean
just not getting pregnant.

32:22.984 --> 32:26.553
And it's definitely not
just for kids.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.947
Okay, any questions that are

32:28.990 --> 32:31.514
not about how weird
that just sounded?

32:35.127 --> 32:36.258
Come on, guys.

32:36.302 --> 32:37.607
I would've thought
with the wealth of--

32:37.651 --> 32:40.523
- Excuse me.
- Oh, yeah.

32:40.567 --> 32:44.614
- If we run out of lube,
is olive oil safe to use?

32:47.095 --> 32:51.012
- Medically speaking
and in moderation, yes.

32:51.056 --> 32:55.103
But if you like your sheets,
I don't recommend it.

32:55.147 --> 32:57.976
Yeah.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.761
How do you ask your partner

33:00.804 --> 33:04.025
to put on a condom
without killing the mood?

33:04.069 --> 33:06.245
- Don't ask.
Do it for him.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.987
And it does not have
to be with your hands.

33:15.167 --> 33:18.518
What do you say if...

33:18.561 --> 33:23.566
if you like foreplay best?

33:23.610 --> 33:28.658
- I would say get in line
behind Dr. Shinwari.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.445
Sorry.

33:41.367 --> 33:43.630
- When I got the new residents
through the door,

33:43.673 --> 33:45.153
my supervisor said I'd have

33:45.197 --> 33:48.461
to pull doubles all weekend
to set them up.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.680
But...

33:52.726 --> 33:56.512
I don't have the energy.

33:56.556 --> 33:59.515
I'm trying, but...

33:59.559 --> 34:01.517
I know you are.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.954
I'm just out of gas.

34:07.697 --> 34:11.614
I haven't seen my kids
in weeks, man.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.616
They're asleep
by the time I get home,

34:13.660 --> 34:16.184
and I'm out the door
before they're up.

34:16.228 --> 34:19.057
I just...

34:19.100 --> 34:22.582
someone's got to do this work.

34:28.762 --> 34:31.982
You know that somebody will.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.768
There will always be work,

34:34.811 --> 34:39.642
and when you're spent,
it's on to the next,

34:39.686 --> 34:44.299
and on to the next,
and on to the next.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.260
What am I supposed to do?

34:51.785 --> 34:56.137
- It will never stop
unless you make it stop.

35:00.185 --> 35:03.753
- This is what I love.
- I know.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.543
It's what I...

35:18.551 --> 35:20.814
I know.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.251
I'm so sorry.

35:35.176 --> 35:37.700
- How are the others?
- Just came to.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.268
Stable.

35:40.312 --> 35:45.099
- Ms. James is looking forward
to her weekly Zumba class.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.796
Good.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.627
Listen, I need to apologize
to all of you.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.977
Today I made the wrong call,

35:54.021 --> 35:56.763
and I forced you
to go along with it.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.113
- Oh, come on.
We'd follow you into fire.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.984
- You know that.
- Mm.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.638
- But I don't want you
to follow me into the fire.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.336
I don't want
to be the kind of boss

36:04.379 --> 36:06.860
where folks are afraid
to speak their mind.

36:06.903 --> 36:08.253
You sure about that?

36:08.296 --> 36:12.648
- Hey, if you see risks
that I don't, tell me.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.520
Disagree with me.

36:14.563 --> 36:15.651
It helps me to know

36:15.695 --> 36:16.957
when I'm walking
down the wrong path.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.569
In fact, it helps me
to know when I'm right.

36:20.613 --> 36:23.050
- Yeah.
- Mm.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.313
Today you were right.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.142
- No, listen,
you don't have to.

36:28.925 --> 36:32.451
- None of us, I mean,
literally none of us

36:32.494 --> 36:34.017
wanted to do these surgeries

36:34.061 --> 36:36.106
because the outcomes
were not in our favor.

36:36.150 --> 36:40.850
But you know whose favor
they were in?

36:40.894 --> 36:44.245
Them, our patients.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.988
You knew that.
You fought for that.

36:48.031 --> 36:51.339
That is why you are the boss.

37:03.308 --> 37:05.832
- Well, look
at this gorgeous man.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.356
I didn't hear you come home.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.489
The sweater looks great.

37:10.532 --> 37:14.493
- Yeah, I'm not gonna
wear this anymore.

37:14.536 --> 37:17.539
Okay, what's going on?

37:17.583 --> 37:20.194
You were right.

37:20.238 --> 37:24.285
I have been trying
to fix everything.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.461
I've been feverishly trying
to make up

37:26.505 --> 37:30.900
for all of my shortcomings
in this marriage.

37:30.944 --> 37:34.426
And I realized today,

37:34.469 --> 37:37.516
wearing this...

37:37.559 --> 37:40.519
sweater,

37:40.562 --> 37:44.523
that I had been doing that
since the night that we met,

37:44.566 --> 37:46.786
been wounding myself

37:46.829 --> 37:50.268
so that you can save me,
Martin.

37:50.311 --> 37:54.010
Because that
is how you love me.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.925
Iggy.

37:55.969 --> 37:57.710
No, no, no.

37:59.755 --> 38:03.324
I am not the problem.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.326
You are.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.431
Excuse me, are you the super?

38:23.475 --> 38:27.043
Only when nothing needs fixing.

38:27.087 --> 38:30.133
Hey, maybe...

38:30.177 --> 38:32.397
maybe you can help me?

38:32.440 --> 38:36.270
I'm looking for someone
who lived here years ago.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.968
Horace Reynolds.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.536
- I don't give out
information on tenants.

38:41.580 --> 38:44.104
Building policy.

38:44.147 --> 38:49.283
- Well, this is
a family matter.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.982
- Nobody by that name has
lived here since I been around.

38:53.026 --> 38:55.985
Good luck.

38:56.029 --> 38:58.118
Thank you.

39:07.606 --> 39:10.478
Hey, Courtney.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.393
I found Dad.

39:13.873 --> 39:15.788
No, never in my life

39:15.831 --> 39:18.356
have I been asked so many
questions about flavored lube.

39:18.399 --> 39:21.750
- I just wish I'm having
that much sex when I'm 80.

39:21.794 --> 39:25.363
- I just hope I'm having
that much sex when I'm 40.

39:25.406 --> 39:28.409
- Thank you for calling me out,
by the way.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.410
Yeah, sorry.

39:29.454 --> 39:32.500
I did get
a little carried away,

39:32.544 --> 39:35.590
but it is true though.

39:35.634 --> 39:37.418
Not always.

39:41.074 --> 39:45.295
Leyla, this is a bad idea.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.949
I know.

39:50.170 --> 39:53.608
- It is.
- You're right.

39:55.915 --> 40:00.876
- So...
- So...

40:13.802 --> 40:17.284
Hey, how was the castle?

40:17.327 --> 40:20.722
- Max, I don't know
how to tell you this.

40:20.766 --> 40:23.421
Tell me what?

40:23.464 --> 40:26.554
- I don't want to get married
in a castle.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.430
I don't know
if I want any of it.

40:36.129 --> 40:38.479
- Kind of thinking
the same thing.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.527
You are?

40:44.354 --> 40:46.922
- I don't think
I'm getting on that plane.

40:48.794 --> 40:51.013
And I know this is unexpected,
and unplanned,

40:51.057 --> 40:52.450
and everything we said
we weren't gonna do,

40:52.493 --> 40:54.495
but I've been waiting
my whole life for you.

40:56.323 --> 41:01.328
And if this is it,
if this is our time, then...

41:01.371 --> 41:05.201
then I don't want
to wait another minute

41:05.245 --> 41:09.597
'cause in a minute,
it could be gone.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.514
<i>I'm not coming back to London.</i>

41:16.169 --> 41:19.651
'Cause you're coming home.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.522
I am?

41:21.566 --> 41:25.787
- Let's get married tomorrow
in New York.

41:25.831 --> 41:27.223
Max.

41:27.267 --> 41:28.660
- Wait, wait, wait.
Just think about it.

41:28.703 --> 41:30.009
Okay, what do you need
for a wedding?

41:30.052 --> 41:31.576
You need two people in love.

41:31.619 --> 41:33.316
You need a couple people,
a couple friends to witness it,

41:33.360 --> 41:34.927
and a super cute flower girl

41:34.970 --> 41:36.494
who just happens
to be my daughter.

41:36.537 --> 41:40.019
- Our daughter.

41:40.062 --> 41:43.109
- Max.

41:43.152 --> 41:45.241
Is that a yes?

41:45.285 --> 41:47.983
Yes.

41:48.027 --> 41:49.594
- Can you say that
again please?

41:49.637 --> 41:52.901
- Yes.

41:52.945 --> 41:57.558
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
