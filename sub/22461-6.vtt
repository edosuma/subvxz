00:18.345 --> 00:20.484
Welcome to the Wind-Tunnel,
my friend,

00:20.492 --> 00:23.851
the Theatre of Screams,
the Black Hole of Cal-nutter.

00:23.852 --> 00:25.891
Really glad to be moving in
with you, Hans.

00:25.892 --> 00:27.451
Literally nowhere else to go.

00:27.452 --> 00:31.451
The... er... bathroom's
currently on a bucket flush system.

00:31.612 --> 00:33.011
The fridge is fucked,

00:33.012 --> 00:35.811
but the bag out the window's
functioning very well.

00:35.812 --> 00:37.811
We do peg and reuse the teabags.

00:37.812 --> 00:39.131
And this...

00:39.132 --> 00:40.491
this'll be your room.

00:40.492 --> 00:42.411
Oh, here goes.

00:42.412 --> 00:43.891
Oh, it's OK.

00:43.892 --> 00:45.931
No skagheads, no corpses, no nonces.

00:45.932 --> 00:48.251
It's Nan's.
Right. Great.

00:48.252 --> 00:49.651
She isn't still using it, is she?

00:49.652 --> 00:51.051
She's dead, Jeremy.

00:51.052 --> 00:53.771
If you want to stop going on
about it for one single minute.

00:53.772 --> 00:55.291
Right, sorry. Of course.

00:55.292 --> 00:59.291
The bag. Finally my destiny
has arrived.

00:59.532 --> 01:03.011
Coaster! Fucking hell, Jez,
I'm not an animal.

01:03.012 --> 01:05.090
Right, well, this is nice.

01:05.092 --> 01:07.011
I can put all of my...

01:07.012 --> 01:08.611
Hans, it's a snake!

01:08.612 --> 01:09.851
Yeah, there are snakes.

01:09.852 --> 01:13.651
There are quite a few snakes in your
room. It's... hard to keep count.

01:13.652 --> 01:16.211
They're very good at hiding.
Sneaky like that.

01:16.212 --> 01:20.211
Not to be too la-di-da, but is there
a room with fewer snakes available?

01:20.372 --> 01:23.371
I tried bagging them up,
but that didn't go down too well

01:23.372 --> 01:25.051
so I just let them get on with it.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.971
Don't worry, though.
They're all right...

01:28.732 --> 01:30.131
for snakes.

01:31.572 --> 01:34.371
I hope Jeremy's OK
in Super Hans' bag.

01:34.372 --> 01:36.291
It is a sleeping bag, yeah?

01:36.292 --> 01:40.291
Who cares? I bet Jez doesn't.
He's having the time of his life.

01:40.972 --> 01:44.571
So... when do you think you might be,
you know, bringing your stuff over?

01:44.572 --> 01:46.171
No pressure.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.971
'Translation - some pressure.'

01:47.972 --> 01:50.691
Probably in about a week.
Jason's van's in the garage.

01:50.692 --> 01:52.451
'Jason - the only man with a van.'

01:52.452 --> 01:55.811
Hey, Dobby, come over here a minute.

01:55.812 --> 01:59.811
'Maybe they're going to brainstorm
another excuse not to move in.'

02:01.092 --> 02:03.771
'I wonder what she's laughing about.
Could just go and ask.

02:03.772 --> 02:05.611
'"What the fuck are you
laughing about?!"

02:05.612 --> 02:07.651
'Might seem a bit aggressive,
though.'

02:07.652 --> 02:09.451
So, five-a-side on Sunday.

02:09.452 --> 02:11.291
We're down a man if you fancy it.

02:11.292 --> 02:14.371
Oh, I'd love to, but I've got
a roast chicken summit with Alice.

02:14.372 --> 02:15.971
'Five-a-side, ugh.

02:15.972 --> 02:18.971
'That's where all the men go
to laugh at the rest of us

02:18.972 --> 02:21.611
'who can't check the brake fluid
or shoot a baboon.

02:21.612 --> 02:24.811
'Alastair Campbell and Alan Hansen
and probably Brian Cox,

02:24.812 --> 02:27.411
'even though he pretends
he's not one of them.'

02:27.412 --> 02:30.371
Oh, my God, I was just chatting
to Trish. Big news.

02:30.372 --> 02:32.731
What?
She's a transsexual.

02:32.732 --> 02:35.811
She's started hormone therapy
and in January she's having the op.

02:35.812 --> 02:37.171
Oh, my God. Really?

02:37.172 --> 02:38.691
No, of course not, dickhead!

02:38.692 --> 02:41.811
The company's got a six-month
project in New York

02:41.812 --> 02:44.531
and Trish asked how
I'd feel about being part of it.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.771
Oh... OK. Wow.

02:46.772 --> 02:49.171
It's between me and Claire
with the hair.

02:49.172 --> 02:51.051
So don't mention it to anyone.

02:51.052 --> 02:55.051
God, I've been looking forward to
moving in with you for months but...

02:55.212 --> 02:57.131
'Oh, the but.'

02:57.132 --> 02:58.691
Oh, it's difficult.

02:58.692 --> 03:00.691
Yeah. God.

03:00.692 --> 03:02.131
Yeah.

03:02.132 --> 03:05.691
'The invented job offer
to escape cohabitation. Classic.

03:05.692 --> 03:08.851
'That is very me.'

03:08.852 --> 03:12.731
I'm not trying to move back in
or anything,
just forgot to give you my keys.

03:12.732 --> 03:15.291
You can come round any time
you like, old friend.

03:15.292 --> 03:17.131
'That's nice. He's so nice.

03:17.132 --> 03:19.411
'He might even let me steal
his girlfriend.'

03:19.412 --> 03:22.251
Yeah, loose keys. Never owned
a keyring, waste of money.

03:22.252 --> 03:24.091
Yeah?
Your Holsten Pils keyring?

03:24.092 --> 03:26.851
The guys over at Holsten
are laughing their arses off at you,

03:26.852 --> 03:29.451
advertising their beer to yourself
every time you come home.

03:30.052 --> 03:31.771
Hi, Jez. How's life in the bag?

03:31.772 --> 03:33.691
Hi, Dobs. Yeah, great.

03:33.692 --> 03:35.611
'Wet from the shower,
Warm from the oven.'

03:35.612 --> 03:38.251
Great to get finally bagged up.
It's like a chrysalis.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.051
I'm going to emerge like
some kind of mad butterfly.

03:41.052 --> 03:42.971
I just came back to give Mark
my keys.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.411
Stay for a cup of tea, at least.

03:44.412 --> 03:46.611
Yeah, tea, or Um Bongo,

03:46.612 --> 03:50.331
the delicious tropical juice drink
with overtones of colonial racism.

03:50.332 --> 03:53.131
'God, I love you.
It's all good.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.571
'Except it's all so very bad.
Oh, my room.

03:55.572 --> 03:59.571
'It's like looking at my own grave,
except I'm so dead there's not even
a body in it.'

03:59.732 --> 04:01.611
It's going to be my home office.

04:01.612 --> 04:03.091
Funny, eh?

04:03.092 --> 04:05.451
What happened to the... bed
and the desk?

04:05.452 --> 04:08.051
Dobby and me drove them
to the... dump.

04:08.052 --> 04:11.691
There's a great little area to leave
stuff someone else might want.

04:11.692 --> 04:13.971
Did you see anyone take them?

04:13.972 --> 04:16.571
Actually, someone did take the bed,
a... woman.

04:16.572 --> 04:19.211
Oh, that's nice to know.
Gone to a good home,

04:19.212 --> 04:21.130
old... beddy.

04:21.132 --> 04:22.771
Yeah.

04:22.772 --> 04:24.731
'She was very much
The on-methadone,

04:24.732 --> 04:27.491
'living-in-a-halfway-house type,
but best not to mention that.'

04:27.492 --> 04:30.171
- I could give it a lick
of paint if you like.
- Um...

04:30.172 --> 04:32.011
'Pay me to hang around
With Dobby.'

04:32.012 --> 04:33.451
I'll do it to the highest
professional standards.

04:33.452 --> 04:35.611
Yes? Can I show you exhibit A,

04:35.612 --> 04:39.611
one of the walls that you started
painting ten years ago and never
finished?

04:39.612 --> 04:41.051
Please, Mark.

04:41.052 --> 04:42.611
I'll... think about it.

04:42.612 --> 04:44.931
'I've thought about it
and it's a no.'

04:44.932 --> 04:46.491
How's everything at Hans'?

04:46.492 --> 04:47.811
Yeah, great.

04:47.812 --> 04:50.811
Oh, good. I... I was worried
it wouldn't be nice.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.251
No, no, it's nice.
I mean, little bump,

04:53.252 --> 04:55.051
cos my room is a bit...

04:55.052 --> 04:56.571
full of snakes.

04:56.572 --> 04:59.011
Snakes?!
Yeah. It's a bit of a snake pit.

04:59.012 --> 05:01.491
But we're going to bag them up
once we get some coke

05:01.492 --> 05:03.251
and get on a bagging vibe.

05:03.252 --> 05:07.211
Until then, I'm sleeping on the sofa,
which is great.

05:07.212 --> 05:09.811
Except Hans is... something
of a night owl.

05:09.812 --> 05:11.131
Oh.

05:11.132 --> 05:15.131
But aside from the snakes
and the... no sleep, good?

05:15.172 --> 05:16.771
Yeah, really good.

05:16.772 --> 05:20.211
I mean, we are taking
quite a lot of drugs.

05:20.212 --> 05:24.211
I did wonder before, you know,
"Will it be too much drugs at Hans'?

05:25.252 --> 05:28.971
"I mean, he talks a lot about them
but he probably doesn't take that
many."

05:28.972 --> 05:32.691
But it turns out
he does do a hell of a lot.

05:32.692 --> 05:34.011
Right.

05:34.012 --> 05:37.651
Yeah. We had a system
but it kind of broke down.

05:37.652 --> 05:39.171
'Surprise, surprise.'

05:39.172 --> 05:41.811
That's probably a bit of a hazard
with drug-taking.

05:41.812 --> 05:44.091
You need to be really careful
with the ratios.

05:44.092 --> 05:46.171
We just got the ratios a bit off.

05:46.172 --> 05:49.211
So... I do think
I am addicted to drugs now.

05:49.212 --> 05:52.051
Well, you've always
been addicted to drugs, Jeremy.

05:52.052 --> 05:55.451
I'm not a drug addict.
Not until very, very recently.

05:55.452 --> 05:58.131
You smoke marijuana every day
and always have.

05:58.132 --> 06:00.451
That's not being a drug addict, Mark,
you moron.

06:00.452 --> 06:03.131
That's just having a little number
to take the edge off.

06:03.132 --> 06:05.331
So, um, Dobby's finally moved in.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.931
Congratulations.

06:06.932 --> 06:09.011
'You lucky, lucky bastard.'

06:09.012 --> 06:13.011
Actually, she's not moving in till
next week, when Jason's van's
all fixed up.

06:13.212 --> 06:14.571
Oh. Right.

06:14.572 --> 06:17.971
'Jason's van? That sounds like the
kind of bullshit I come up with.'

06:17.972 --> 06:21.731
I... I was worried she was delaying
on purpose, having cold feet.

06:21.732 --> 06:23.851
'Yes! God, I'm such a bad friend.'

06:23.852 --> 06:27.851
And now she's had this job offer
in New York that I'm not supposed
to talk about.

06:28.292 --> 06:31.971
Do you think she could have
made that up to avoid moving in?

06:31.972 --> 06:33.331
'Duh. Obviously.'

06:33.332 --> 06:34.571
I wouldn't worry, mate.

06:34.572 --> 06:36.771
So I've booked a romantic weekend
away for us.

06:36.772 --> 06:37.971
'Shit.'

06:37.972 --> 06:39.171
Great.

06:39.172 --> 06:41.491
I'm going to nail down
this New York lie.

06:41.492 --> 06:44.611
Get her away, confront her
and watch her squirm.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.291
Brilliant. Yeah.

06:46.292 --> 06:49.331
Very romantic.

06:49.332 --> 06:52.091
'Look normal.
Look like you fit in.

06:52.092 --> 06:53.651
'Do a little run.'

06:53.652 --> 06:55.371
Hey, Simon!

06:55.372 --> 06:56.611
Mark...

06:56.612 --> 06:59.371
Heard you guys might need
an extra pair of legs for the game.

06:59.372 --> 07:02.571
Umm... we got Olly to come down,
so we're on five-a-side.

07:02.572 --> 07:04.171
Oh?

07:04.172 --> 07:05.851
But, mate, join in.

07:05.852 --> 07:08.691
Mark's joining bibs,
you get him second half.

07:08.692 --> 07:10.171
'Bibs. Great.

07:10.172 --> 07:12.171
'He naturally assumes
I know about bibs.'

07:12.172 --> 07:14.571
So what are you, defence,
attack, goalie?

07:14.572 --> 07:16.611
Bit of this, bit... bit of that.

07:16.612 --> 07:18.571
D'you see the game the other night?

07:18.572 --> 07:19.531
Which game?

07:19.532 --> 07:21.451
The... The big fixture.

07:21.452 --> 07:22.891
Oh, you missed a great one.

07:22.892 --> 07:25.691
It was a really... great game.

07:25.692 --> 07:28.811
Nothing over head height, no slides,
no-one in the D, yeah?

07:28.812 --> 07:32.131
'Oh, God, what? What?
I need to write this down!'

07:32.132 --> 07:34.011
Can I touch it?
Switch it. Switch it!

07:34.012 --> 07:36.891
'What does that mean?'
I... I don't know what you mean!

07:36.892 --> 07:38.811
Switch it!

07:40.532 --> 07:42.491
Sorry, guys.

07:42.492 --> 07:45.011
I... I was going to, you know,
kick it up the other end

07:45.012 --> 07:47.891
and just put one... right
in their fucking goal hole,

07:47.892 --> 07:51.691
but... no dice.

07:51.692 --> 07:54.411
So I hear something big
might be happening for you guys

07:54.412 --> 07:55.891
on the other side of the pond.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.371
Make sure you stay in some space,
yeah, Mark?

07:58.372 --> 08:02.131
Yeah, dude, don't worry, I've got
this whole wing side on lockdown.

08:02.132 --> 08:04.131
New York-based project, yeah?

08:04.132 --> 08:06.051
'Hmm, suspiciously quiet.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.211
'Maybe Dobby is playing me
for a trout.

08:08.212 --> 08:09.691
'There is no New York deal!'

08:09.692 --> 08:13.691
Take him out. Take out!
'What? What?'

08:14.132 --> 08:15.811
That was too hard!

08:15.812 --> 08:18.971
Someone's going to get hurt
if you kick it that hard!

08:18.972 --> 08:22.971
I mean, that was just too hard,
correct?

08:24.292 --> 08:27.571
'Need to admit I love Dobby.
Who to tell first?

08:27.572 --> 08:30.291
'Her - more exciting,
him - more noble.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.291
'Or... together?

08:32.292 --> 08:34.770
'More Jeremy Kyle,
with a small chance

08:34.772 --> 08:38.770
'he might cave my head in with his
2003 Personal Finance Award.'

08:39.491 --> 08:41.530
You've got some paint on the light
switch.

08:41.532 --> 08:44.251
Yeah, well, that's going to happen,
unless I take forever.

08:44.251 --> 08:46.971
Is this... white?
Is this actual white?

08:46.972 --> 08:48.691
It's apple white. It's cheaper.

08:48.692 --> 08:50.851
Oh, I don't want slightly green
white.

08:50.852 --> 08:53.451
Oh, Jez, this isn't
what I wanted at all!

08:53.452 --> 08:55.611
Oh, come on, Mark.
You knew when you hired me

08:55.612 --> 08:57.611
it wasn't going to be
a "professional" job.

08:59.012 --> 08:59.651
Hey, Dobs.

08:59.652 --> 09:02.051
Why the fuck have you been spying
on me?

09:02.052 --> 09:03.771
I... I'm sorry?

09:03.772 --> 09:06.891
Did you try and squeeze information
out of Simon about the New York job

09:06.892 --> 09:08.451
while pretending to play football?

09:08.452 --> 09:10.011
I wasn't pretending.

09:10.012 --> 09:13.571
I... I just happened to be passing
and felt like a kickaround

09:13.572 --> 09:16.491
and, in the lulls, tried to strike
up friendly banter.

09:16.492 --> 09:19.331
You happened to be passing
a sports centre in Hackney

09:19.332 --> 09:23.011
on the way from your flat in Croydon
to your corner shop in Croydon?

09:23.012 --> 09:26.331
'Ooh, poor old Mark.
The old stepping-on-the-rake trick.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.571
'All I have to do is paint and wait.

09:28.572 --> 09:30.451
'Wait and paint.'

09:30.452 --> 09:31.771
I suppose I...

09:31.772 --> 09:35.331
I didn't believe you liked me enough
to move in with me.

09:35.332 --> 09:36.851
Don't be a fucking dickhead.

09:36.852 --> 09:40.331
I guess it's things like... calling
me "a fucking dickhead" so much.

09:40.332 --> 09:42.691
"Dickhead" is a term of endearment,
knobhead.

09:42.692 --> 09:44.571
Of course the job is real.

09:44.572 --> 09:45.731
'Oh, fuck.'

09:45.732 --> 09:49.491
And now they've offered me the job.
They've chosen me over Claire.

09:49.492 --> 09:51.051
Well...

09:51.052 --> 09:52.691
congratulations.

09:52.692 --> 09:56.331
Yeah. Claire's never going to get on
until she rethinks the hair.

09:56.332 --> 09:58.931
So... I don't know what to do.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.891
Well, if... if you don't mind me
making a suggestion...

10:02.892 --> 10:05.451
why don't you stay
and move in with me?

10:05.452 --> 10:07.011
But...

10:07.012 --> 10:08.931
this is a big opportunity.

10:08.932 --> 10:11.411
New York. It's massive.

10:11.412 --> 10:13.251
Sure, the... the Massive Apple.

10:13.252 --> 10:15.211
But, at the same time,

10:15.212 --> 10:17.371
I've just had the home office
painted.

10:17.372 --> 10:19.971
I'll be moving my desk in there.

10:19.972 --> 10:22.171
You can have this whole bit.

10:22.172 --> 10:24.291
'Mmm, is she going to buy this?

10:24.292 --> 10:26.251
'Might have to sex up the bit.'

10:26.252 --> 10:29.683
It ain't Greenwich Village,
but it's yours.

10:31.569 --> 10:34.068
I actually did quite a good job,
though I say it myself.

10:34.095 --> 10:35.174
I'm sorry I doubted you.

10:35.175 --> 10:37.734
No problemo.
I'd have doubted me too if...

10:37.735 --> 10:39.014
Hang on.

10:39.015 --> 10:41.454
Have you cleaned the paint
off that light switch?

10:41.455 --> 10:43.334
No, Jez, why would I...?

10:43.335 --> 10:46.254
Yes, you bloody did! This is loads
better than when I left it.

10:46.255 --> 10:50.174
I'm sorry, I just wanted it to be
nice, and obviously you're not
competent.

10:50.175 --> 10:51.374
Oh, God.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.374
Look. All the charm's gone,
all my little touches.

10:54.375 --> 10:57.854
It's like you've put a fluorescent
safety jacket on the Mona Lisa.

10:57.855 --> 11:00.094
So...

11:00.095 --> 11:02.974
Dobby's thinking
about taking the job in New York.

11:02.975 --> 11:04.374
Oh, no.

11:04.375 --> 11:05.574
'Oh, God.'

11:05.575 --> 11:07.014
But I've got a plan.

11:07.015 --> 11:09.414
I'm going to push things up a gear.

11:09.415 --> 11:11.334
I'm going to ask Dobby to marry me.

11:11.335 --> 11:12.814
'Fuck!'

11:12.815 --> 11:16.214
I just think now's the time
for a big statement,
show her how I really feel.

11:16.215 --> 11:19.534
I'm going to pop the question
in the Quantocks on the weekend.

11:19.535 --> 11:22.494
Dobby's driving. She's stopping off
to see Gerrard's sister

11:22.495 --> 11:24.774
and her depressing laundry outlet
in Reading.

11:24.775 --> 11:28.134
The Quantocks? Where you
accidentally proposed to Sophie?

11:28.135 --> 11:31.694
Is that where you have to ask
women to marry you, by law?

11:31.695 --> 11:33.654
So... do you think it's a good plan?

11:33.655 --> 11:34.774
Show her how I feel?

11:34.775 --> 11:36.134
Well, honestly...

11:36.135 --> 11:39.574
'This is the moment. Got to tell him
the truth. Tell him I love Dobby.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.294
'Grasp the nettle
and get stung to fuck

11:41.295 --> 11:43.774
'and face the firing squad
and get shot to bloody pieces.'

11:43.775 --> 11:45.574
Yeah, good plan.
Thanks, Jez.

11:45.575 --> 11:47.374
Good to talk it through with a mate.

11:51.055 --> 11:54.574
'Didn't grasp the nettle, obviously.
Who would grasp a fucking nettle?'

11:57.255 --> 11:59.854
It's very good of you to help me,
Jez,

11:59.855 --> 12:01.254
but it's not the 1830s.

12:01.255 --> 12:03.974
I... I think I'll survive
the terrifying train experience.

12:03.975 --> 12:06.414
'Got to tell him I love Dobby.
That's the honourable way.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.334
'Tell him, then tell Dobby.

12:08.335 --> 12:10.134
'Dobby will say she needs
to think about it

12:10.135 --> 12:12.934
'but I'll be able to tell
she really does love me,

12:12.935 --> 12:16.934
'probably, and we buy Mark a cake
and all have a right old... laugh?'

12:16.935 --> 12:20.014
Right, well, er, thanks.
See you Monday.

12:20.015 --> 12:22.094
Hope everything goes well.
Thanks, mate.

12:22.095 --> 12:24.574
'Got to say it.

12:24.575 --> 12:26.014
'Got to say something.'

12:26.015 --> 12:28.254
The train's going to leave, Jeremy.

12:28.255 --> 12:29.734
Yeah. So, apologies,

12:29.735 --> 12:32.334
but I think you should know
I'm in love with Dobby.

12:32.335 --> 12:35.454
I'm sorry, what the fucking hell
are you talking about?

12:35.455 --> 12:37.774
I thought it was only fair
for you to know. Goodbye.

12:37.775 --> 12:39.494
Sorry, can I just get past?

12:39.495 --> 12:42.774
Before my best friend kills me
with a tuna baguette.

12:42.775 --> 12:45.494
Oh, my fucking God,
this train is running on time.

12:45.495 --> 12:46.774
This is unprecedented.

12:47.495 --> 12:48.734
Oh, no.

12:48.735 --> 12:52.134
Oh, fuck!

12:52.135 --> 12:54.534
Oh, back to the scene of the crime

12:54.535 --> 12:58.534
to face the music and dance,
like some mad musical murderer.

12:59.415 --> 13:01.254
How the hell am I going to play this?

13:01.255 --> 13:04.534
Just going to totally fucking ignore
it. It never happened.

13:04.535 --> 13:08.014
So... I'm back.

13:08.015 --> 13:12.014
Oh, look, an interview with the new
USA national football coach,
Jurgen Klinsmann.

13:13.935 --> 13:17.294
What in the name of holy fuck
is going on?

13:17.295 --> 13:19.094
Look, I'm really, really sorry

13:19.095 --> 13:23.094
but Dobby... I mean,
she's just so lovely.

13:23.495 --> 13:25.134
I know she's lovely.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.614
That, sadly, appears to be one thing
that we agree on.

13:27.615 --> 13:29.414
I feel terrible. I do.

13:29.415 --> 13:31.654
I've been carrying
around this weight for months.

13:31.655 --> 13:34.094
So you thought it was about time
to drop it on my head?

13:34.095 --> 13:36.214
You don't understand, Mark.
I'm in love with her.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.014
I want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

13:38.015 --> 13:39.294
The love tap is gushing.

13:39.295 --> 13:41.534
Well, turn it off.
I can't. I've tried.

13:41.535 --> 13:43.854
Well, try harder. Put some fucking
elbow grease into it.

13:43.855 --> 13:46.774
How am I supposed to do that when
there's no such thing as elbow
grease?

13:46.775 --> 13:50.294
Look, Mark, I knew how much this
would hurt you, how angry you'd be.

13:50.295 --> 13:54.174
That's why I planned to tell you
and then get off the train
right afterwards.

13:54.175 --> 13:55.974
How incredibly noble!

13:55.975 --> 13:58.734
God, this is so stressful.
I feel terrible.

13:58.735 --> 14:00.974
Tickets, please.

14:00.975 --> 14:04.334
I don't suppose you'd lend me some
money for a drink? Bit of lager?

14:04.335 --> 14:08.214
I am the very last person on this
train who would lend you money,
Jeremy.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.134
Currently, the very thing that would
solve all my problems is you dying
of thirst.

14:12.135 --> 14:14.734
Tickets, please.

14:14.735 --> 14:18.054
Yeah, I wasn't meant to be here.
I was just helping him with his
luggage...

14:18.055 --> 14:19.574
Not by request.

14:19.575 --> 14:23.454
And then the doors closed.
I... I've come on the train
by mistake.

14:23.455 --> 14:26.454
Standard single, that's, er, £34.60.

14:26.455 --> 14:28.054
Mark, would you mind?

14:28.055 --> 14:29.134
Yes, I would mind.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.294
Oh, for God's sake, it's 30 quid,
I'll pay you back.

14:31.295 --> 14:33.294
Look, I'm sorry about this,

14:33.295 --> 14:36.174
but this is really between you two
rather than me.

14:36.175 --> 14:39.054
I mean, we're friends,
we live together.

14:39.055 --> 14:40.134
No, we don't.

14:40.135 --> 14:43.174
We're on a weird one. He's got the
money. Ask him why he won't pay.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.894
The situation is perfectly simple.

14:44.895 --> 14:47.734
There's a passenger without a ticket
who refuses to pay for one.

14:47.735 --> 14:49.374
You should remove him
from the train.

14:49.375 --> 14:52.014
She can't throw me off a moving train
in the middle of nowhere!

14:52.015 --> 14:54.054
What if I walk on the tracks?
I might die.

14:54.055 --> 14:56.814
Here's a tip, Jeremy.
Don't walk on the tracks.

14:56.815 --> 14:59.814
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave the train at the next
station.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.374
Great with me,
that's where we're going.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.694
That's your punishment of last
recourse? Free travel?

15:05.695 --> 15:06.734
'Probably off to get him

15:06.735 --> 15:09.214
'a complimentary fare-dodger's
colouring book.'

15:09.215 --> 15:11.454
I can't believe
you're actually thinking of coming.

15:11.455 --> 15:14.494
I need to tell Dobby. I told you,
like an honourable man...

15:14.495 --> 15:17.414
An honourable man would have become
a monk or chopped his nuts off

15:17.415 --> 15:20.374
or gone to Morocco and become
a paedo or a charity worker.

15:20.375 --> 15:23.414
That's as may be,
but by my own code of ethics...

15:23.415 --> 15:24.654
Incredibly shitty ethics.

15:24.655 --> 15:26.774
I think I've done the right thing.

15:26.775 --> 15:29.334
So now I'm going to come with you
and tell Dobby how I feel.

15:29.335 --> 15:32.534
I mean, you've got to admit, me and
Dobby are a better fit than you.

15:32.535 --> 15:33.934
We click.

15:33.935 --> 15:35.214
I haven't heard any clicking.

15:35.215 --> 15:37.054
Oh, the clicking is continuous!

15:37.055 --> 15:39.974
That's why you haven't noticed it.
Click, click, click, click, click.

15:39.975 --> 15:43.094
Well, me and Dobby make a great...

15:43.095 --> 15:44.374
team.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.454
Opposites attract.

15:46.455 --> 15:47.934
No, they don't. Not really.

15:47.935 --> 15:51.534
That's just something that scientists
and people in horrible relationships
say.

15:51.535 --> 15:55.414
I mean, be honest, the things
you always moan about Dobby -

15:55.415 --> 15:59.374
I mean, you know, the DJ bars, the
dope smoking, the poorly arranged
finances -

15:59.375 --> 16:01.854
don't they remind you of someone?

16:01.855 --> 16:05.454
I told you all those quibbles
in a different... era.

16:05.455 --> 16:09.454
You can't use them against me now
in this... kangaroo court of love.

16:09.975 --> 16:12.854
Me and Dobby don't quibble.
You never spend any time together!

16:12.855 --> 16:14.814
Look, I'm really, really serious,
Mark.

16:14.815 --> 16:16.774
I can't see a way out of this.

16:16.775 --> 16:20.574
I think maybe, like... like,
one of us should kill ourselves.

16:20.575 --> 16:22.694
The life coach speaks!

16:22.695 --> 16:26.094
Maybe the reason you think
you're in love with Dobby

16:26.095 --> 16:29.294
is that she's the woman you've been
spending most time with recently.

16:29.295 --> 16:33.294
If you'd spent the same amount of
time with, I don't know, her,
then...

16:33.495 --> 16:35.294
you might fall in love with her
instead.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.494
Do you think I'm some kind of
sex duckling

16:37.495 --> 16:40.214
who'll follow anyone around
who's got breasts and a vagina?

16:40.215 --> 16:41.454
No.

16:41.455 --> 16:43.734
I love Dobby, Mark!

16:43.735 --> 16:45.174
And I know it's true love

16:45.175 --> 16:49.174
because I'm prepared to sacrifice
my closest friendship for it.

16:49.615 --> 16:50.894
I'm going to tell her.

16:50.895 --> 16:53.574
Look, I... I think we need
a cooling-off period.

16:53.575 --> 16:55.254
Just go back to London,

16:55.255 --> 16:58.734
find out what Nancy's up to,
watch some pornos,

16:58.735 --> 17:02.734
have a couple of gay flings
and then, at the end of... two weeks,

17:03.375 --> 17:07.374
if you stil feel the same,
then maybe you can say something.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.934
By which time, you've got her
all married like a trussed-up hog.

17:10.935 --> 17:13.054
If you agree to hold off,

17:13.055 --> 17:17.054
then I could perhaps promise not to
ask Dobby to marry me for a couple
of weeks.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.013
OK. Deal?

17:20.015 --> 17:21.773
Deal.

17:21.775 --> 17:25.773
'Two weeks to find the nicest
ring for under £200.'

17:27.454 --> 17:31.454
OK, mate. Next one to London's
the 12.14. See you later.

17:32.175 --> 17:35.654
Yeah. Actually, thinking about it, I
don't know if I am going to go back.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.934
Hi.

17:37.935 --> 17:40.254
What the fuck?
That was the agreement.

17:40.255 --> 17:41.934
I know. I've just got
this quite strong feeling

17:41.935 --> 17:43.694
you're going to break the agreement
and propose.

17:43.695 --> 17:46.734
- I just said I wouldn't.
- Yeah, I know. The thing is,
I don't trust you.

17:46.735 --> 17:48.774
What if I say you can't?

17:48.775 --> 17:52.774
If you say that, I might be forced
to say something too.

17:53.015 --> 17:54.294
Hey, Dobs.

17:54.295 --> 17:55.974
Hey, Jez.

17:55.975 --> 17:59.974
Er, yeah, I just thought it might be
nice if Jeremy joined us for the
weekend.

18:01.215 --> 18:02.454
Hope you don't mind.

18:02.455 --> 18:05.214
Oh, no, that's... totally fine.

18:05.215 --> 18:08.654
Don't mind me. I'll just be hanging
out, staying close to my buddy here.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.774
Cos we look after each other.

18:10.775 --> 18:13.054
You watch my back, I watch yours.

18:13.055 --> 18:17.054
Isn't that right, dude?

18:18.015 --> 18:19.694
What's going on, Mark?

18:19.695 --> 18:22.054
I'm really sorry,
but I had to bring him.

18:22.055 --> 18:25.134
It turns out there's something
I need to tell you about Jeremy.

18:25.135 --> 18:27.374
I should have told you
a long time ago

18:27.375 --> 18:30.254
but there's a reason why
he's such a dickhead.

18:30.255 --> 18:33.014
Yeah?
It's ironic with the life coaching,

18:33.015 --> 18:34.894
but it turns out he's a drug addict.

18:34.895 --> 18:38.614
I won't be long!
I'll be very quick!

18:38.615 --> 18:40.134
Right, OK.

18:40.135 --> 18:44.134
Also, he can't get an erection
unless he thinks about
something... disgusting.

18:44.615 --> 18:46.774
I don't want to say what.

18:46.775 --> 18:50.134
Plus he thinks he might be gay.
He's 80% certain.

18:50.135 --> 18:52.534
'80, nice. No need to overdo it.'

18:52.535 --> 18:55.574
So he's dealing with that,
which I think is great,

18:55.575 --> 18:57.614
and I'm being very supportive over.

18:57.615 --> 19:01.614
I always thought he might be
a bit gay, but more like 30%,
if I'm honest.

19:01.735 --> 19:03.334
He's incredibly unstable.

19:03.335 --> 19:07.334
So it was either bring him along or
risk getting home to find him, you
know...

19:09.775 --> 19:11.254
Yeah.

19:11.255 --> 19:13.894
Right. It's just...
our special weekend away?

19:13.895 --> 19:15.494
'Change the subject.'

19:15.495 --> 19:16.734
One sugar, Jez?

19:16.735 --> 19:18.614
Yes, please.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.894
I gave him one without sugar the
other day and he got really angry
with himself

19:21.895 --> 19:24.574
and smashed up a CD case
and tried to eat the pieces.

19:24.575 --> 19:27.814
'He'd better not have bloody
said anything or there will be
repercussions.

19:27.815 --> 19:29.694
'Extremely romantic repercussions.'

19:29.695 --> 19:31.254
So...

19:31.255 --> 19:32.574
did I miss anything?

19:32.575 --> 19:33.934
I had half a Scotch egg.

19:33.935 --> 19:35.294
Brilliant.

19:35.295 --> 19:37.974
'I need a wee too,
but I will continue resisting.

19:37.975 --> 19:41.214
'My bladder is not so easily
the master of me, young Jedi.'

19:41.215 --> 19:42.534
Pie, Mark?

19:42.535 --> 19:45.494
No, I'm fine, thanks, Dobs,
but I'll cut you a slice.

19:45.495 --> 19:47.214
'He doesn't want any delicious pie?

19:47.215 --> 19:49.574
'Normally he loves pie. Suspicious.

19:49.575 --> 19:50.854
'Very suspicious.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.974
'He did spend a long time in the
kitchen preparing the picnic.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.254
'Of course! A ring!

19:55.255 --> 19:58.094
'He's smuggled the bloody
engagement ring into the pie!'

19:58.095 --> 20:02.094
Sorry, Dobs, just need to check
something.

20:02.815 --> 20:04.254
What the hell are you doing?

20:04.255 --> 20:06.534
I'm wise to you,
my fine, feathered friend.

20:06.535 --> 20:10.534
'He's gone mad.
Now to stigmatise the mentally ill.'

20:11.375 --> 20:13.174
Apologies. All good.

20:13.175 --> 20:15.014
Great picnic, though, Dobs.

20:15.015 --> 20:18.254
Yeah, it's just a shame Jeremy
put too many olives in the salad.

20:18.255 --> 20:20.014
No, I bloody didn't.

20:20.015 --> 20:22.934
Dobby doesn't like olives. If you
knew her better, you'd know that.

20:22.935 --> 20:25.174
I don't mind them so much
these days.

20:25.175 --> 20:26.694
Yes, you do, you hate them.

20:26.695 --> 20:28.934
Oh, so now you're calling Dobby
a liar. That's charming!

20:28.935 --> 20:32.534
I'm not, I'm saying she's hiding the
truth to be nice. There's a very big
difference.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.134
Look, I really don't mind
about the olives.

20:35.135 --> 20:38.254
See? Mmm! Olives!

20:38.255 --> 20:41.934
Lovely,
Greasy, bitter, horrible olives!

20:41.935 --> 20:43.294
I told you.

20:43.295 --> 20:45.654
She was being sarcastic.
Can't you tell?

20:45.655 --> 20:48.134
Hi, Simon.

20:48.135 --> 20:49.534
'Ugh, Simon.'

20:49.535 --> 20:51.334
Yeah, about 13 olives.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.694
'What part of "ex-boyfriend"
doesn't he understand?'

20:53.695 --> 20:57.334
No, I'm just on a picnic.
I'll spit these olives out, hang on.

20:57.335 --> 20:59.694
This is horrible. Why don't
you go back to London, then?

20:59.695 --> 21:02.174
Oh, so you can ask her to marry
you? That's what we agreed.

21:02.175 --> 21:03.254
Fuck the agreement.

21:03.255 --> 21:05.774
Oh, great, that's brilliant.
Fuck the agreement.

21:05.775 --> 21:08.454
Fuck the Geneva Convention.
Fuck Parliamentary democracy.

21:08.455 --> 21:10.974
Fuck everything.
Is that your great new idea?

21:10.975 --> 21:13.054
You know how weak my powers
of self-control are.

21:13.055 --> 21:16.414
Normally I can't wait five minutes
before having a wank or a spliff
or a chocolate biscuit.

21:16.415 --> 21:18.574
I've restrained myself
for nearly three hours.

21:18.575 --> 21:21.654
That's got to stand for something.
I'm sorry...

21:21.655 --> 21:24.294
but I'm going to tell Dobby
how I feel about her.

21:24.295 --> 21:27.334
OK. Well, in that case,
I'm going to ask her to marry me.

21:27.335 --> 21:29.854
No, you're fucking not!
Yes, I fucking am.

21:29.855 --> 21:32.814
- You can't ask someone
to marry you without a ring.
- Oh, shit, you got me!

21:32.815 --> 21:36.094
Except, no, you totally haven't,
you dickwad. Of course you can.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.174
You can't propose,
it's against the agreement.

21:38.175 --> 21:41.294
The agreement's already broken
because you already broke it!

21:41.295 --> 21:42.694
Oh, fuck you!

21:42.695 --> 21:43.734
Dobby!

21:43.735 --> 21:45.574
No, Jeremy! Dobby!

21:47.455 --> 21:49.494
What the hell are you doing?

21:49.495 --> 21:53.374
That fence is electrified
like a motherfucker.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.614
No, Jeremy.

21:54.615 --> 21:56.214
What?
I know what you're thinking.

21:56.215 --> 21:59.334
Oh, really?
Is this about the bloody olives?

21:59.335 --> 22:01.534
No, Dobby.
It's about something else.

22:01.535 --> 22:03.494
Aaagh!

22:03.495 --> 22:05.014
What the hell did you do that for?

22:05.015 --> 22:08.294
Because, Dobby, there's something
I need to say to... Aagh! Ow!

22:08.295 --> 22:10.534
Will you stop electrocuting
each other?

22:10.535 --> 22:13.054
Hi, Simon.

22:13.055 --> 22:15.294
'What's a step up from electric?

22:15.295 --> 22:16.734
'A nice big stick.'

22:16.735 --> 22:19.014
Oh, we're allowed sticks now,
are we?

22:19.015 --> 22:21.494
It's come down to sticks.
Is that what it's come down to?

22:21.495 --> 22:22.654
As a matter of fact, it has.

22:22.655 --> 22:24.934
Well, how about rocks?

22:24.935 --> 22:27.174
Are rocks invited to the party?

22:27.175 --> 22:29.894
Come on, then. Rock me, Amadeus.
You know you want to.

22:29.895 --> 22:31.734
Yeah, you'd love that, wouldn't you?

22:31.735 --> 22:34.054
"Dobby, the bad man threw
a rock at me."

22:34.055 --> 22:37.334
Mark, if you don't throw that rock at
me, I'm going to hit you with this
stick.

22:37.335 --> 22:39.574
Those are the available options.

22:39.575 --> 22:42.214
Oh, my God, she's gone.
Where's she gone?

22:42.215 --> 22:44.494
Yeah, good one.
Distract me, then crush my skull.

22:44.495 --> 22:46.294
I'm not falling for that one,
old friend.

22:46.295 --> 22:48.094
Dobby?

22:48.095 --> 22:49.294
Dobby!

22:49.295 --> 22:50.854
'Fucking hell!'

22:50.855 --> 22:52.454
Shit.

22:52.455 --> 22:55.494
See? She's gone.
You've driven her off. Happy now?!

22:55.495 --> 22:57.134
Ow!

22:57.135 --> 22:58.974
You were asking for that, Jez.

22:58.975 --> 23:01.174
Don't tell me you weren't,
because you know you were!

23:01.175 --> 23:02.494
Dobby!

23:02.495 --> 23:05.134
Please be Dobby.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.134
Oh, fuck. What?

23:07.135 --> 23:09.694
She's flying to New York tonight
with Simon.

23:09.695 --> 23:11.054
She's...

23:11.055 --> 23:12.214
She's taking the job.

23:12.215 --> 23:15.174
"Was hoping this weekend

23:15.175 --> 23:18.974
"would be a chance to make up
after all the weirdness."

23:18.975 --> 23:21.774
She means you spying on her.
You've fucked it, you idiot.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.614
'No, I bloody haven't.'

23:23.615 --> 23:27.454
"But clearly the fact
that you brought J..." - Jeremy -

23:27.455 --> 23:31.454
"...proves that you can't handle
intimacy." You've fucked it, not me.

23:31.455 --> 23:35.454
Hang on, why does it say here
that I'm 80% gay?

23:40.495 --> 23:43.894
I'll kill you, Jeremy, for trying to
steal Dobby and electrocuting me

23:43.895 --> 23:45.534
and destroying my fucking pie!

23:45.535 --> 23:47.034
Dobby!

23:47.080 --> 23:53.323
