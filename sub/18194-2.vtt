<i>Previously on</i> THE ROYALS...

00:01.569 --> 00:03.914
I will find Simon's body
and when I do,

00:04.006 --> 00:07.218
Liam and Eleanor's paternity will
be verified and you'll be replaced.

00:07.304 --> 00:11.218
No Simon, no DNA, no Paternity.

00:11.359 --> 00:13.625
We have an opening for the
king's head of security.

00:13.734 --> 00:15.203
I'd like it to be you.

00:15.453 --> 00:17.882
Can't remember the last time I
went this long without having sex.

00:17.906 --> 00:20.593
Maybe I could arrange a little
service call for your Majesty.

00:20.648 --> 00:23.129
It's a pleasure to finally
meet our new lord Chamberlain.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.218
Violet, I love you.

00:26.507 --> 00:28.125
'I'm sorry I messed up.'

00:28.632 --> 00:31.414
Jasper. I've decided to
forgive you.

00:31.515 --> 00:32.983
- For what?
- All of it.

00:33.069 --> 00:35.124
Hashtag,
'King Liam movement.'

00:35.179 --> 00:36.305
I'd like to know where it
started.

00:36.329 --> 00:37.757
Better still, who started it.

00:37.879 --> 00:41.581
You will find that taking a
life is an unbearable weight.

00:42.551 --> 00:43.973
Sorry, we're shut.

00:45.301 --> 00:46.394
I thought about you a lot.

00:46.451 --> 00:48.251
I should have done more for you.

01:25.412 --> 01:27.404
Prince Robert, how did you
survive on the island?

01:27.429 --> 01:28.404
Were you scared?

01:28.429 --> 01:30.592
Describe the moment
you knew you were in peril.

01:30.638 --> 01:32.427

01:57.901 --> 01:59.643
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:59.691 --> 02:01.612
Are you a Princess?

02:02.440 --> 02:05.776
- That's what they tell me.
- Where's your crown?

02:07.206 --> 02:10.408
I don't sleep in the crown.
It's too pointy.

02:10.533 --> 02:12.268
Do you have one?

02:12.425 --> 02:15.776
- I suppose I do, yeah.
- How about glass slippers?

02:16.175 --> 02:18.573
I'm a Princess, not Cinderella.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.885
- What about a prince?
- What about it?

02:20.948 --> 02:23.128
- Do you have one?
- Well, define 'Prince.'

02:23.260 --> 02:25.128
You know, like a boy
who likes you

02:25.182 --> 02:28.596
And rides a white horse and
kisses you awake sometimes.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.878
I have several princes, yeah.

02:32.214 --> 02:34.557
I'm not too sure about the
white horse part.

02:34.745 --> 02:36.401
Okay, good.
See you later.

02:36.478 --> 02:38.344
- Bye.
- Wait!

02:39.675 --> 02:42.604
Who are you, exactly, again?

02:42.753 --> 02:46.487
Oh. I'm called Sara Alice. You
can call me Sara or Alice.

02:46.574 --> 02:47.612
Or whatever you want,

02:47.637 --> 02:49.323
Considering you're a Princess.

02:49.827 --> 02:51.940
I appreciate that. Thank you.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.828
Ooh, is that fairy dust?
Stop!

03:02.129 --> 03:03.815
That's...

03:04.472 --> 03:06.628
Poison from the evil queen.

03:06.690 --> 03:09.456
You know the story. I do
know all about it, yes.

03:09.583 --> 03:13.118
Good. Well, don't ever touch
that.

03:14.188 --> 03:16.588
Whoever you are.
Sara Alice.

03:16.651 --> 03:19.235
Yes, of course.
You said that. Right...

03:19.409 --> 03:21.370
Are you sure you're a Princess?

03:21.620 --> 03:23.065
I'm pretty sure, yeah. Why?

03:23.097 --> 03:25.846
Did you swallow some of the
wicked queen's poison?

03:25.925 --> 03:28.026
I think some got in my nose,
yeah.

03:28.128 --> 03:31.042
I can tell. You don't look
very Princess-y.

03:31.651 --> 03:33.885
That's very nice.
Come on, let's go,

03:34.401 --> 03:36.141
Sara Alice in the palace.
Heel!

03:36.292 --> 03:38.877
I'm not a dog,
but I'd love to have one.

03:39.018 --> 03:43.749
Daddy says I'm allergic to
dogs, cats, and horses.

03:43.985 --> 03:45.384
Right...

03:46.300 --> 03:48.729
How's the hangover?

03:48.846 --> 03:52.385
I feel like a pack of wild dogs
dragged me through the streets.

03:53.385 --> 03:56.096
You look like it, too. Here.

03:56.253 --> 03:58.297
- Thanks.
- Cup of tea isn't too much to ask

03:58.417 --> 04:00.495
before the motorcade
steals you away.

04:00.628 --> 04:02.901
- You know the story.
- I do.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.306
I erm, put my number
in your phone.

04:07.435 --> 04:09.630
You know, in case you find
yourself drunk

04:09.677 --> 04:12.111
or once again cornered by
rabid dogs.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.180
- How have you been, Kathryn?
- I've been okay.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.824
- Keeping busy.
- Yeah. Same.

04:20.454 --> 04:23.325
Not the same kind of
busyness at all.

04:24.259 --> 04:26.271
The rest of it's the same.

04:29.325 --> 04:32.779
Last time I saw you...
We took that picture.

04:33.872 --> 04:35.934
I remember.

04:36.138 --> 04:38.937
For what it's worth,
you look good.

04:40.274 --> 04:44.076
Thanks.
You, not so much.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.464
Thanks for the tea.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.690
Erm, you got your phone?
Wallet, keys?

04:52.787 --> 04:55.026
I don't have keys.
I'm a prince.

04:56.057 --> 04:58.378
Yes, you certainly are.

04:58.893 --> 05:03.174
We always have to remember that. No,
you always have to remember that.

05:04.057 --> 05:07.581
Thank you. It really is
wonderful to see you.

05:15.391 --> 05:18.377
Go. I have to list your cup

Choose your next words very
carefully.

06:21.783 --> 06:24.548
Ah! At 11:00am, your Majesty has
an audience

06:24.578 --> 06:27.212
With her Majesty Queen
Letizia of Spain

06:27.267 --> 06:30.559
Regarding the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization.

06:30.736 --> 06:33.509
I took the Liberty of including
some background materials

06:33.580 --> 06:35.408
as they pertain to
her Majesty's work

06:35.525 --> 06:37.523
as Special Ambassador
for Nutrition.

06:37.642 --> 06:41.198
At 1300, you have
a luncheon and tea

06:41.292 --> 06:45.887
with several members of the League of
Women for the Preservation of London.

06:46.059 --> 06:47.614
Those bitches are relentless.

06:47.746 --> 06:51.309
Very well. In the future, I like to know
the menu in advance for my lunches.

06:51.418 --> 06:54.731
I... Yes, ma'am. This afternoon's
main course

06:54.848 --> 06:58.739
will be the smoked salmon with
lemon butter and watercress.

06:58.989 --> 07:03.252
And if I may suggest the
Oolong Formosa tea.

07:03.471 --> 07:07.627
Fermented Tea from Taiwan,
featuring an attractive Amber hue,

07:07.776 --> 07:11.456
A gentle multi-taste, yet a
robust and fully-developed Aroma.

07:12.588 --> 07:16.120
- Anything else?
- You'll look pretty in the pink one.

07:16.792 --> 07:19.264
Strictly professional,
Mr Hoenigsberg.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.703
Of course.

Shouldn't you be wearing a

07:36.482 --> 07:38.928
At least a ribbon in your hair.

07:39.201 --> 07:41.019
Isn't your hair supposed
to be blonde?

07:41.107 --> 07:43.842
- Ssh!
- At least more golden-y colored.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.691
- Ssh!
- Hey, nice underpants.

07:49.193 --> 07:50.896
I found this in my room.
You can have it.

07:51.193 --> 07:53.373
- Be warned, it's chatty.
- Argh!

07:55.045 --> 07:57.162
Well, what am I supposed to
do with her?

07:57.326 --> 07:59.171
Try asking your boss.

08:03.365 --> 08:07.771
- You're short.
- Do you know anything about children?

08:08.068 --> 08:10.982
No. But I do carry a gun.
Let's go.

08:11.209 --> 08:13.045
My daddy is James Hill.

08:13.115 --> 08:15.428
I assumed as much.
You know why?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.774
- Why?
- Because he's short, too.

08:17.852 --> 08:22.485
You walk too fast. You know
your legs are longer than mine.

08:27.839 --> 08:30.313
Can you get me some ice cream?

08:31.048 --> 08:35.360
I have to say, it was a big surprise when
your people reached out, your Majesty.

08:35.407 --> 08:38.743
I wasn't doing anything else,
so I thought, 'what the hell?'

08:38.868 --> 08:42.423
I hear you have a big
secret announcement for us.

08:42.571 --> 08:46.337
You may have noticed that my
signature sideburns are gone.

08:46.524 --> 08:48.610
It's because my hair's been
falling out.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.376
Male pattern baldness.

08:50.571 --> 08:54.267
Comes hand in hand with
er, erectile dysfunction.

08:54.399 --> 08:56.462
Yes, I have that, too.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.540
Because I had a
testicle removed.

08:59.954 --> 09:03.954
You see, I have cancer.

09:06.516 --> 09:08.816
And it appears to be winning.

09:10.985 --> 09:15.071
Why now? Why tell the world
like this, tonight?

09:15.149 --> 09:16.962
Because there are people in
the palace

09:17.024 --> 09:19.977
Who think they can manipulate
me with this information.

09:20.204 --> 09:24.063
So I'd rather share it with the
world than a precious few

09:24.235 --> 09:25.496
takes their power away.

09:25.582 --> 09:29.392
Are you hoping they'll feel more
sentimental towards you and your reign?

09:29.478 --> 09:31.540
Dear God, I hope not.

09:31.900 --> 09:35.103
Most of my family are
treacherous assholes.

09:35.446 --> 09:38.962
They hide behind fake
smiles and loud charity,

09:39.120 --> 09:42.439
like a bunch of Hollywood
actresses.

09:43.415 --> 09:47.876
Well, the truth is
they don't care about you.

09:48.275 --> 09:50.243
They care about their image.

09:50.439 --> 09:53.071
That and their
billion-dollar empire.

09:54.634 --> 09:59.986
The only true good person in that
entire palace... Was Violet.

10:01.509 --> 10:03.939
And now she's gone, too.

10:04.696 --> 10:07.376
So you can say
what you want about me,

10:07.556 --> 10:09.657
And think what you'd like,

10:10.526 --> 10:12.985
But at least
I'm honest with you.

10:15.428 --> 10:17.602
Remember that when I'm gone.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.266
Should be any day now.

10:53.345 --> 10:56.439
<i>You get cash back on purchases
with no annual fee.</i>

11:10.810 --> 11:12.777
Ah, wilhelmina.

11:13.404 --> 11:15.045
Your Majesty.

11:15.149 --> 11:17.015
- Do you prefer Wilhelmina or Willow?

11:17.354 --> 11:20.149
- Willow is fine.
- Willow, good.

11:20.401 --> 11:22.968
- I prefer Your Majesty.
- Walk with me.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.868
I'm compelled by your
understanding of social media.

11:29.986 --> 11:33.041
How you manipulated a nation
with hashtag 'king Liam.'

11:33.252 --> 11:35.338
I merely planted the seed,
your Majesty.

11:35.542 --> 11:38.009
Well, the seeds have
blossomed nicely.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.512
I'd like to hire you.

11:40.635 --> 11:42.892
To do what, exactly?

11:43.033 --> 11:46.798
Whatever it is you did and
however it is you did it.

11:47.071 --> 11:48.954
We're an Archaic Institution.

11:49.071 --> 11:51.665
Liam's reign is going
to need fresh ideas.

11:51.856 --> 11:53.915
Liam's reign?

11:54.157 --> 11:57.915
I'm going to prove that Liam is the
legitimate heir to the throne.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.134
And when I do,
I want to make sure

12:00.190 --> 12:03.101
that the world
insists that he become king.

12:03.399 --> 12:05.001
Will you help me
advance that message?

12:05.157 --> 12:09.007
If I thought I could trust
you, I would do this.

12:09.134 --> 12:11.076
For Liam, because I do
believe in him.

12:11.235 --> 12:13.618
Then I guess you're hired,
because you can trust me.

12:13.747 --> 12:15.747
At least in regards to this.

12:16.907 --> 12:20.064
And, Willow, the information
about proving Liam's paternity,

12:20.212 --> 12:23.212
let's keep that off the face
page for a bit, shall we?

12:32.743 --> 12:37.472
- What?
- Your eyebrows look like caterpillars.

12:39.295 --> 12:41.395
Daddy!

12:42.519 --> 12:43.842
I thought
if I let you wander a bit,

12:43.844 --> 12:46.535
A man with sweets might trick
you into his Van or something.

12:46.596 --> 12:48.896
Mr caterpillar
is taking care of me.

12:49.008 --> 12:52.144
- Jasper.
- Can I go and see the Princess again?

12:52.269 --> 12:55.691
Fine. Go. Give your friend
the Caterpillar a rest.

12:55.724 --> 12:56.684
Jasper.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.777
He had a mean
girlfriend named Sara once.

12:58.871 --> 13:01.152
Now I'm his nice girlfriend.

13:01.285 --> 13:04.422
Hey.
What are the rules?

13:04.532 --> 13:08.016
No fire, no knives,
and if anyone finds me,

13:08.102 --> 13:10.438
tell them I came from
the womb of a jackal.

13:10.537 --> 13:12.164
Perfect. Be careful.

13:12.205 --> 13:14.719
Okay, I will.
Bye, Jasper caterpillar.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.113
What are your intentions
with my daughter?

13:20.050 --> 13:22.837
Speaking of girlfriends,
I understand

13:22.915 --> 13:25.316
You and the Princess
are getting closer?

13:25.837 --> 13:27.275
How do you know that?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.934
I'm the head of security.

13:30.126 --> 13:31.900
Did you notice my new suit?

13:32.720 --> 13:34.993
We're um, doing better.

13:35.704 --> 13:38.423
Well, as pleased as I am for
the both of you, and I am,

13:38.829 --> 13:40.720
Have you considered what
comes next?

13:41.040 --> 13:44.064
The Princess so much as glances
at someone, it's headline news.

13:44.228 --> 13:45.641
She holds their hand,
it goes global.

13:45.665 --> 13:47.478
If the public uncovers your
relationship,

13:47.509 --> 13:50.173
the level of scrutiny
would be unprecedented.

13:50.348 --> 13:52.348
I'm not just talking
about your accent.

13:54.345 --> 13:57.228
I've got to go.
I'll do what I can to help.

14:00.453 --> 14:02.320
Hang in there, kid.

14:04.337 --> 14:09.775
'The only true good person in
that entire palace... Was Violet.

14:10.751 --> 14:13.126
And now she's gone, too.'

14:15.634 --> 14:19.126
We're doing an assessment of the public's
reaction to the news of his cancer.

14:19.290 --> 14:20.431
And the rest of it.

14:20.473 --> 14:24.298
At this rate he's going to kill the
monarchy before cancer kills him.

14:24.751 --> 14:28.275
We need to get into that lair
of his and find some DNA.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.482
Hair or toenails or a
used condom. Something!

14:31.548 --> 14:34.197
He has his own guards
stationed outside the room.

14:34.322 --> 14:37.611
He rarely exits. Most of the
time he uses his double.

14:37.743 --> 14:40.415
Do you trust James Hill,
your Majesty?

14:41.110 --> 14:43.276
Is he team Helena?

14:43.572 --> 14:45.243
Yes, I believe he is.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.829
Then as far as I'm concerned,

14:46.915 --> 14:49.275
His Majesty just told us
everything we need

14:49.368 --> 14:52.228
to secure your proof, tonight.

15:04.306 --> 15:06.345
There's something
you'd like to tell me?

15:06.478 --> 15:10.001
Do you have any idea how dangerous
that question is for me?

15:10.236 --> 15:16.204
Word on the street... Is that
you're seeing other girls.

15:18.365 --> 15:21.126
Sara Alice?

15:21.938 --> 15:24.379
She seems to be quite
smitten with you.

15:25.047 --> 15:27.055
Well, can you blame her?

15:28.308 --> 15:31.181
And anyway, we never said
that we were exclusive.

15:31.275 --> 15:36.986
Is that right? A little cocky
for a guy of your misdeeds.

15:37.642 --> 15:41.853
I'll play along. You're right,
we never said we were exclusive.

15:45.204 --> 15:49.305
But you do understand that
that works both ways, yes?

15:50.423 --> 15:55.433
I understand that, yep.
Good. Good, good, good.

16:00.278 --> 16:02.291
Good talk.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.784
Go away.
I gave at the office.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.672
It's James Hill, your Majesty.

16:25.971 --> 16:28.580
Er, your new head of security?

16:28.678 --> 16:32.010
Little small for such a big
job, aren't we, biggie smalls?

16:32.088 --> 16:33.537
With all due respect,
your Majesty,

16:33.571 --> 16:36.002
the last guy was taller,
but killed people.

16:36.287 --> 16:39.721
And besides, your Majesty seems
to be accomplishing great things

16:39.862 --> 16:41.940
Whilst being
the opposite of tall.

16:42.011 --> 16:44.471
Sucking up as opposed
to simply sucking off

16:44.548 --> 16:46.885
will get you nowhere with me,
Mr Hill.

16:47.396 --> 16:48.401
What do you want?

16:48.426 --> 16:51.588
I need you to come to my office
so we can scan your retinas.

16:51.657 --> 16:54.291
Forget it.
Bring it to me.

16:54.402 --> 16:56.827
I'm afraid that's not
possible, your Majesty.

16:56.907 --> 16:59.452
Well, then you won't be
scanning my peepers, Hill.

16:59.516 --> 17:01.149
I understand.

17:01.276 --> 17:03.749
But should your Majesty
decide to leave the palace

17:03.979 --> 17:07.953
At some point in the future, including
through the not-so-secret tunnels,

17:08.183 --> 17:10.617
we'll need
your retinal scans on file.

17:10.970 --> 17:13.289
I do apologize for
the inconvenience.

17:16.148 --> 17:20.453
Fine. I'll be there
when it suits me.

17:31.086 --> 17:33.109
Hello, Liam.

17:33.492 --> 17:34.758
I don't like the sound of that.

17:34.809 --> 17:37.491
What? I feel like I have
hardly seen you lately.

17:37.492 --> 17:39.430
I just...

17:39.484 --> 17:42.102
Geez, what is up with you?

17:42.876 --> 17:45.510
I'm... Dealing
with some stuff.

17:45.724 --> 17:48.117
God, by letting it
kick your ass?

17:48.398 --> 17:50.465
Just... Hold still.

17:50.947 --> 17:53.114
What stuff?

17:53.901 --> 17:55.800
I've been thinking a lot
about Ted.

17:57.758 --> 17:59.938
Okay. He wasn't always
a bad guy, you know.

18:00.961 --> 18:03.742
He just... gave into the darkness
and couldn't find his way back.

18:04.264 --> 18:07.469
Okay, and what does
that have to do with this?

18:09.945 --> 18:11.979
I'm trying to find my way back.

18:13.208 --> 18:15.275
Trying not to give in.

18:17.291 --> 18:21.500
Do you want some advice? Stop
getting punched in the face.

18:22.459 --> 18:24.602
Ted had a choice to make
and so do you.

18:24.828 --> 18:26.984
He chose darkness and you won't.

18:27.211 --> 18:29.035
- Okay?
- Ow...

18:29.250 --> 18:33.742
Right, so I was thinking, how'd you
like to get out of town for the day

18:33.875 --> 18:36.078
And hang out with me?
The electric carnival is on.

18:36.126 --> 18:38.493
Thanks, I think I'm just
gonna lay low for a few days.

18:38.557 --> 18:42.524
Come on. We'll have a dance,
couple of cocktails.

18:42.719 --> 18:44.680
Jasper could be our
security detail.

18:44.781 --> 18:47.297
- Jasper?
- Sure, why not?

18:47.388 --> 18:51.047
You guys hanging out again?
Non-exclusive by any chance?

18:51.399 --> 18:52.609
Possibly. Why?

18:52.750 --> 18:55.156
You don't want to hang out with me,
you want to make Jasper jealous.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.863
A-A-A-Ah. That's ridiculous.

18:59.784 --> 19:01.793
Fine, I want to make him
jealous. I do.

19:01.972 --> 19:03.972
Jasper thinks that he can
have the cow,

19:04.301 --> 19:07.373
And still drink from its teats.

19:07.468 --> 19:09.389
- Not even close.
- You know what I mean.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.749
I need to teach him a lesson
so you have to come with me.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.549
- Plus, it will be fun, Liam.
- Come on.

19:13.730 --> 19:17.231
That's all you had to say.
Everyone's so deceitful around here.

19:17.473 --> 19:19.251
Let the guy wearing make-up.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.644
Give us some dirt, Princess. Who
are you dating at the moment?

19:55.668 --> 19:57.715
Er, no-one exclusively.

20:06.082 --> 20:09.241
Prince Robert, when you first landed on the
island, what were your initial thoughts?

20:09.265 --> 20:12.004
Wow! I was hoping that the rescue
would be successful.

20:12.098 --> 20:14.028
I thought if I could simply
stay coherent,

20:14.176 --> 20:16.426
Keep myself visible, the
search party would find me.

20:16.512 --> 20:19.473
But when that storm kicked in and
lasted for as long as it did,

20:19.645 --> 20:21.739
I realized I'd be stranded
for a bit.

20:21.856 --> 20:24.325
At that point it was all
about staying alive.

20:24.481 --> 20:26.159
- Day by day.
- And how did you do that?

20:26.184 --> 20:27.942
Did you have shelter
or any supplies?

20:28.012 --> 20:31.403
I had a military issue scabbard
that belonged to my father,

20:31.551 --> 20:34.504
I had a single flare
and a small compass.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.228
The rest I made up on the fly.

20:36.317 --> 20:38.887
You survived for eight months with
nothing but an antique knife?

20:38.982 --> 20:41.282
My father's knife.

20:42.904 --> 20:45.405
Is it true you
chose to stay on the island?

20:50.489 --> 20:52.918
They say you could
have come home.

20:53.485 --> 20:55.739
That there was a boat
you could have signaled.

20:56.793 --> 20:59.084
But you didn't.

21:01.332 --> 21:03.399
Is that true, Robby?

21:13.801 --> 21:16.262
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

21:21.345 --> 21:23.445
Excuse me, that's my table.

21:23.973 --> 21:27.950
Charlie Madden. It's a good
thing we have security.

21:28.207 --> 21:29.935
- Hey, what up, Madden?
- How are you doing, mate?

21:29.959 --> 21:30.770
Mwah!

21:30.825 --> 21:32.545
- Nice to see you. How are you?
- Very well.

21:33.311 --> 21:35.512
- I know you're not here solo.
- God, no.

21:35.582 --> 21:39.207
My entire crew is here. Most of
them hoping to meet the Princess.

21:39.426 --> 21:41.715
And er, someone else you
might know.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.520
I didn't know you two knew
each other.

21:44.894 --> 21:46.879
We just met, actually.

21:47.043 --> 21:49.035
And I thought
you had better judgment.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.301
Oh! Wow.

21:51.278 --> 21:52.778
Buy you both a free drink?

21:52.981 --> 21:54.184
- Yes, please.
- Alright.

21:54.231 --> 21:55.741
I want to meet these friends,
Madden.

21:55.823 --> 21:56.948
- No. Patience.
- Immediately.

21:56.972 --> 21:59.231
- Alright, Willow, this one's for you.
- Thank you.

21:59.311 --> 22:00.510
Madden.

22:05.285 --> 22:08.629
You need my eyes?
That's all you're getting.

22:08.793 --> 22:11.523
- Make it quick, Hill.
- As you wish.

22:12.087 --> 22:14.555
Please, sit here.

22:21.315 --> 22:23.449
I'll prepare the scan.

22:31.098 --> 22:34.848
We located a double that bears a
striking resemblance to the king,

22:35.213 --> 22:37.280
as long as he doesn't
have to speak.

22:58.039 --> 23:00.340
Violet?

23:09.983 --> 23:12.608
You understand she's just
trying to make you jealous?

23:12.748 --> 23:14.653
- Yes.
- And?

23:17.513 --> 23:19.146
It's working.

23:20.670 --> 23:22.286
Come back? Okay.

23:22.373 --> 23:26.264
- You want some advice?
- Let her do her thing.

23:26.522 --> 23:29.936
I know my sister. It will completely
infuriate her if you don't...

23:36.373 --> 23:39.537
Violet? Violet!

23:40.429 --> 23:42.663
Violet!

24:00.443 --> 24:02.509
Yes!

24:06.629 --> 24:09.738
Oh, my God...

24:09.938 --> 24:12.785
OMG, this is so exciting.

24:14.879 --> 24:17.410
Good God, where did you
find this guy?

24:17.660 --> 24:20.621
Gay strip club. Apparently
he does quite well.

24:20.973 --> 24:23.107
Hm, it's kinda tacky.

24:39.043 --> 24:40.918
You're killing him,
you realize that?

24:41.066 --> 24:44.348
Mm. We're just having fun.
He loves it.

24:44.410 --> 24:48.199
He does not love it. But let's
say you make him jealous.

24:48.380 --> 24:50.446
Then what?

24:51.543 --> 24:54.676
Then he'll admit that he
wants to be exclusive.

24:54.816 --> 24:56.496
That's what you want?
To be exclusive?

24:56.559 --> 25:00.413
No, I just want him
to want to be exclusive.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.686
Jasper has to admit that he
wants me and only me

25:04.788 --> 25:06.780
before I can say
the slightest thing

25:06.805 --> 25:08.561
about maybe
possibly wanting him.

25:08.624 --> 25:11.186
It's, like, girl 101,
dum-dum.

25:11.303 --> 25:12.632
Mm!

25:15.225 --> 25:17.796
Be glad your mother got out
when she did, Willow.

25:17.897 --> 25:20.710
You never have to deal with
any of this madness.

25:21.069 --> 25:24.100
Yeah, about that...

25:24.413 --> 25:27.007
The queen offered me a job
in the palace today.

25:28.764 --> 25:30.428
Doing what, exactly?

25:30.749 --> 25:31.944
As best I can tell,

25:32.007 --> 25:35.585
She wants me to spend my days and
nights saying nice things about you.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.335
Tough job.

25:37.475 --> 25:43.241
But if you think it might get in the way
of our friendship, I won't take it.

25:43.436 --> 25:47.866
We won't let that happen. I think
the monarchy is lucky to have you.

25:48.296 --> 25:49.725
And so am I.

25:50.217 --> 25:53.613
Although you do understand
what a circus my family is?

25:53.957 --> 25:55.941
Tthey can't be that bad.

25:57.644 --> 26:00.925
Nothing. It's like the man's
hairless cat.

26:02.855 --> 26:05.050
Rachel, anything?
No, Ma'am.

26:05.183 --> 26:06.658
Mr Hoenigsberg?

26:07.894 --> 26:11.004
I regret to say,
not a thing, your Majesty.

26:11.409 --> 26:13.363
Would a testicle work?

26:13.929 --> 26:16.063
Ah!

26:21.879 --> 26:26.043
Vanity. The enemy of wisdom
and common sense.

26:35.733 --> 26:37.800
Let's go.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.302
Hello, Jasper.

27:24.011 --> 27:27.535
The boys I've been flirting
with, they keep disappearing.

27:27.691 --> 27:30.566
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

27:31.793 --> 27:33.714
No?

27:34.251 --> 27:36.144
Okay, follow-up question.

27:36.730 --> 27:40.097
This morning I had to cover my
brother's cuts and bruises.

27:40.316 --> 27:42.558
Is there anything you can
tell me about that?

27:42.816 --> 27:44.197
His highness asked me not to.

27:44.285 --> 27:48.668
Oh, is that right? Well, is there
anything that you can tell me?

27:50.097 --> 27:52.551
I can tell you that the weight of
what happened at the king's cup

27:52.575 --> 27:55.433
has affected him a great deal.
A lot more than he thinks.

27:55.644 --> 27:58.074
The burden of 'hashtag king
Liam' makes him feel guilty,

27:58.144 --> 28:01.113
There's a girl he likes but he's
trying to keep his distance,

28:01.191 --> 28:04.718
most likely to protect her, and I can tell
you that he loves his sister very much.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.410
Not very discreet,
are you, Jasper?

28:07.457 --> 28:10.246
No, I'm massively discreet.

28:10.394 --> 28:13.074
But in this case I think you
might be able to help him.

28:13.855 --> 28:16.699
And besides, he's the brother
of a girl I care about.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.865
Well played.

28:34.980 --> 28:37.511
Liam, I love you!

28:38.652 --> 28:40.793
It's constant, isn't it?

28:40.972 --> 28:44.660
The fascination with len
and you and your family.

28:45.152 --> 28:47.785
Living life under the
microscope, perpetual scrutiny.

28:47.902 --> 28:52.550
You must want to... Step away
from it all sometimes.

28:54.105 --> 28:56.403
Sometimes.

28:56.894 --> 28:59.347
Truth is, from the moment
I was born...

28:59.574 --> 29:01.441
It's never been an option.

29:01.915 --> 29:03.957
You do a good job with it.

29:04.754 --> 29:06.590
It was worse for Robert.

29:06.754 --> 29:10.824
We could hide every now and then.
He was always in the spotlight.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.043
What do you want?

29:54.163 --> 29:56.863
(excited screaming and yelling)

30:06.949 --> 30:08.660
You okay?

30:09.246 --> 30:10.800
I am.

30:12.168 --> 30:14.191
Just been thinking about Robby.

30:14.636 --> 30:16.730
I've been doing
that a lot lately.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.722
He'd be proud of you, you know.

30:20.847 --> 30:22.660
I'm not so sure that's true.

30:22.777 --> 30:25.035
Well, it is and you know it is.

30:27.416 --> 30:29.816
I've been asking myself
if I'm a good person lately.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.234
Because of Ted? Because
of all kinds of things.

30:35.096 --> 30:38.793
Well, the answer is 'yes, '
no matter what.

30:39.785 --> 30:42.324
No matter what, okay?

30:46.821 --> 30:48.918
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

30:53.090 --> 30:55.123
I want to be exclusive with
Jasper.

30:55.933 --> 30:58.902
But sometimes I feel like
I'm not good enough

30:59.129 --> 31:02.832
And that my shit-show of a
life isn't fair to him, so...

31:03.894 --> 31:06.082
You understand he's a conman
from las Vegas

31:06.129 --> 31:08.613
who tried to rob you
and slept with our mother?

31:10.214 --> 31:12.394
And yet my life
still seems messier.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.705
He can handle it.

31:15.949 --> 31:17.911
So can she.

31:18.394 --> 31:20.129
The girl in your head.

31:21.660 --> 31:26.621
Ever since Robby died, you have been
as selfless as anyone I've ever known.

31:26.754 --> 31:30.433
You put me first, put mum
first, dad's legacy, all of it.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.684
Put you first, Liam.

31:33.738 --> 31:36.761
It's okay to be happy.

31:38.050 --> 31:40.629
And to want someone
who makes your heart race.

31:40.769 --> 31:44.222
Your goodness?
It's easy to see.

31:45.121 --> 31:48.269
You deserve to have whatever
you want or whoever you want.

31:48.472 --> 31:50.754
I promise, okay?

31:52.355 --> 31:54.191
Same.

31:54.555 --> 31:56.522
Yeah...

32:27.924 --> 32:29.690
Come in.

32:33.082 --> 32:35.589
- Hi.
- Hi.

32:36.004 --> 32:38.636
No Liam again tonight?

32:39.011 --> 32:41.293
No. He asked for some time
alone.

32:41.480 --> 32:44.519
Is he going to need more
make-up in the morning?

32:44.754 --> 32:46.543
I think he's done with all that.

32:47.322 --> 32:49.199
I hope so.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.623
Can you unzip me, please?

33:11.576 --> 33:14.207
- Did you have fun today?
- Not really, no.

33:14.308 --> 33:16.418
Why not?

33:16.691 --> 33:18.847
I think you know why not.

33:19.050 --> 33:21.066
Didn't like the music?

33:23.277 --> 33:26.566
Well, I thought it was a
perfectly nice day.

33:27.625 --> 33:30.910
Good music, nice friends.

33:31.050 --> 33:32.652
Cute boys.

33:32.793 --> 33:36.269
Not that it was exclusively
about the cute boys,

33:36.305 --> 33:38.082
But I mean, it didn't hurt.

33:38.222 --> 33:39.847
I think you've made your point.

33:40.082 --> 33:42.004
What point?

33:43.007 --> 33:45.241
Were you jealous?

33:48.331 --> 33:50.531
You're Goddamn right
I was jealous.

33:51.115 --> 33:55.988
I just spent the last 12 hours watching
a bunch of douchebags hit on my...

33:56.410 --> 33:58.136
I want to be with you.

33:58.363 --> 34:01.152
You know I do, but I can
never be sanctioned.

34:02.004 --> 34:05.199
We can never have days like
we had today together.

34:05.800 --> 34:09.199
They'll find out about my past.
That's okay, I've done what I've done

34:09.246 --> 34:11.480
But they'll hold it against
you and that's not okay.

34:11.594 --> 34:13.918
I couldn't do that to you.
I never would.

34:15.340 --> 34:17.373
Come with me.

34:26.315 --> 34:29.150
600 years ago there was a Royal.

34:29.433 --> 34:31.721
A young queen, actually.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.293
And she fell for her
bodyguard. Imagine that.

34:35.371 --> 34:38.308
- Were they exclusive?
- Watch it.

34:39.714 --> 34:44.033
They started this epic,
earth-shattering love affair.

34:44.254 --> 34:46.659
Quietly, secretly.

34:47.011 --> 34:49.879
Quite scandalous, but it
didn't matter to them.

34:51.277 --> 34:55.784
And they would write the most
romantic, aching love letters

34:55.918 --> 34:58.613
and hide them
in a hollowed-out book.

35:06.199 --> 35:08.121
This book.

35:11.527 --> 35:16.433
Every time I enter this
library I look inside...

35:17.058 --> 35:19.068
For a letter of my own.

35:21.457 --> 35:23.152
It's not fair to you to ask you

35:23.191 --> 35:26.925
to have to settle for someone you'd
have to hide from the world.

35:27.785 --> 35:30.144
Who says I'd be settling?

35:38.050 --> 35:40.761
So what happened to this
queen and her bodyguard?

35:41.355 --> 35:43.092
They got married.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.418
They had two sons,
who both did great things.

35:48.519 --> 35:50.925
One of them was called Jasper.

35:51.394 --> 35:55.574
Jasper Tudor. You may have heard of
them, the Tudors. It's a true story.

36:05.451 --> 36:07.451
You take my breath away,
you know that?

36:12.151 --> 36:14.217
Of course I do.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.083
Maybe you should try writing
that down sometime.

36:28.886 --> 36:30.606
Hi.

36:31.139 --> 36:32.722
Hi.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.797
I wanted to see you.

36:39.363 --> 36:44.136
From the time I was born, I was taught
not to say what I was thinking,

36:44.379 --> 36:45.949
Not to listen to my heart,

36:46.058 --> 36:47.756
But tonight I want to tell
the truth.

36:47.933 --> 36:50.425
It's what I should have done
the first moment I saw you.

36:50.561 --> 36:52.519
Yeah, but you didn't.

36:52.746 --> 36:57.793
And, yes, when you texted me,
my heart skipped a beat.

36:58.136 --> 37:00.339
But I can think of a million
reasons why we can't do this.

37:00.363 --> 37:02.496
I can think of one big reason...

37:06.332 --> 37:08.254
My heart is a disaster.

37:08.394 --> 37:09.645
My head's even worse

37:09.714 --> 37:12.886
and I know this isn't easy
for you.

37:13.816 --> 37:16.535
But I want you, and I know
you feel it too.

37:16.699 --> 37:17.768
Oh, Liam...

37:17.793 --> 37:21.261
Kiss me and then tell me
if I should stay or go.

37:38.067 --> 37:40.200
Stay.

37:45.558 --> 37:47.383
You tricked me!

37:47.488 --> 37:49.451
Yes, I did.

37:50.472 --> 37:52.402
What have I ever done to you?

37:53.285 --> 37:55.066
You should pour yourself
a drink, Cyrus.

37:55.144 --> 37:57.011
My answer will take a while.

37:57.129 --> 38:00.597
All these years I stood by you.

38:00.816 --> 38:02.558
I conspired with you.

38:02.699 --> 38:05.043
And look where it got you.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.058
Your face is on our currency.

38:07.207 --> 38:09.290
Your head wears a crown.

38:09.454 --> 38:13.204
You were a footnote.
Now you're a king.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.564
You're welcome.

38:14.665 --> 38:17.423
Don't be so certain
about those results.

38:17.572 --> 38:19.790
It's not like you kept
your legs closed.

38:19.884 --> 38:22.908
And even if the little
bastards are Simon's,

38:23.079 --> 38:26.353
You think I'm giving up
my reign without a fight?

38:26.517 --> 38:30.978
I'm a dying man with sovereign
immunity and nothing to lose.

38:31.103 --> 38:34.869
So, you'd better
watch your back...

38:35.173 --> 38:36.799
Bitch.

38:42.619 --> 38:45.439
Wake up. Time to go home.

38:46.087 --> 38:47.915
I'm not asleep.

38:49.322 --> 38:50.479
Did you have a good day
at the palace?

38:50.481 --> 38:52.939
Uh-huh. I did all kinds of
things.

38:53.150 --> 38:55.908
What did you do today, daddy?

38:56.126 --> 38:57.696
Do you remember
when you were a little girl

38:57.720 --> 38:59.619
and you said,
"Help them, daddy"?

38:59.837 --> 39:03.540
That's what I did today. And
that's what I'll do tomorrow.

39:03.673 --> 39:05.751
Until they can help themselves?

39:05.884 --> 39:08.072
Until they can help themselves.
