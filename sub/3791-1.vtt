-Six.
-Are you out
of your mind, Drama?

01:27.462 --> 01:29.464
That girl was perfect.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.634
Excuse me, sweetheart.

01:32.717 --> 01:36.429
How would you
like to come to a movie
premiere Wednesday night?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.891
<i>Aquaman</i> ?

01:39.974 --> 01:42.435
-I'd love to.
-Here you go.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.729
-See you there.
-Thanks.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.815
See you there.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.566
"Six" my ass, Drama.

01:48.650 --> 01:52.153
She was a six to me.
And I wouldn't have
given her a ticket.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.281
Fifty hot girls have
walked by, guy's had
a problem with every one.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.659
-That's 'cause
none will look at him.
-What was wrong with her?

01:57.742 --> 01:59.285
She was top-tall, bro.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.162
What the fuck
is top-tall?

02:01.246 --> 02:03.623
Torso's too long,
legs are too short.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.583
-She was inverted.
-Your brain's inverted.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.669
I don't have to defend
my rating system.

02:07.752 --> 02:11.005
Every girl I've given
a ticket to has been
at least an eight.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.591
And what do you rate, Drama?
I'm just curious.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.177
Blow me, E.
I don't have to rate,
I'm holding the cards.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.638
Not many cards left.
How many did you guys
give out anyway?

02:18.721 --> 02:21.391
-Just the right amount.
-Yeah, it's like chumming
for sharks, Vince.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.561
You throw enough blood and guts
in the water, you're bound
to catch a great white.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.437
Yeah, except there's gonna
be 50 girls at the party

02:26.521 --> 02:28.231
who all show up thinking
they're your dates.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.526
And what happens when
50 sharks show up looking
for their goodies, E?

02:31.609 --> 02:33.778
Both:
Feeding frenzy.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.864
Whatever.
We got Ari in 30.
Let's roll.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.615
Let's do it.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.660
(rock music playing)

02:42.745 --> 02:45.039
Hey.
10!

02:45.123 --> 02:46.749
(all laugh)

02:46.833 --> 02:49.752
-Last ticket.
-Our work here is done.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.296
Excuse me!

03:00.096 --> 03:03.057
Jesus Christ!
Lloyd!

03:08.104 --> 03:10.064
What the fuck is this?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.900
-Your finger.
-It's dust, Lloyd.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.027
It's fucking dust.
Why is it here?

03:14.110 --> 03:16.070
The cleaning staff's
on strike.
You know that.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.407
They strike, you work.
You're Asian. You're
supposed to be a neat freak.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.159
Go get a rag.

03:21.242 --> 03:23.077
You're nervous
Vince is coming up.

03:23.161 --> 03:26.623
-Lloyd!
-It's the agent, Ari,
not the office.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.666
And you do have
a lovely view.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.793
It's West fucking
Hollywood, Lloyd!

03:30.877 --> 03:34.422
And what I got is nine people
in 1400 square feet.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.049
Now go grab a rag.
Go!

03:36.132 --> 03:40.094
I want every desk to be
sterile enough for you
to get trained on.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.808
Lloyd!

03:45.892 --> 03:47.977
♪ ♪

03:56.027 --> 03:57.946
Look at this.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.739
(scoffs)
what a dump.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.658
You could use
the exercise anyway,
fat boy.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.786
Yeah, why don't you
race me up, you
50-year-old cocksucker?

04:10.124 --> 04:12.669
Hoo-hoo!
Hey, Lloyd.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.128
-Hey.
-Hey, Lloyd,

04:14.212 --> 04:16.005
You might want to tell
someone the elevator's out.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.925
I would tell someone,
Johnny Drama, but who?

04:19.008 --> 04:20.843
Do you guys need a quarter
to feed the meter?

04:20.927 --> 04:23.137
(chuckles)
No, we're all good, Lloyd.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.598
You telling me
I couldn't be repped
at this shithole?

04:25.682 --> 04:28.142
You've been repped
at bigger shitholes,
right?

04:28.226 --> 04:31.020
-What's the good
word, boys?
-Ari!

04:31.104 --> 04:32.939
Drama:
Hey, Ari.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.525
Hey, the place is, uh,
it's really...

04:35.608 --> 04:38.236
-It's nice.
-Thanks, Drama.
How're you doing?

04:38.319 --> 04:40.738
Still no agent.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.073
What do you say?

04:42.156 --> 04:44.617
I say that it's important
that whoever reps you

04:44.701 --> 04:46.244
cares about you,
right?

04:46.327 --> 04:49.414
-Right.
-Right. Vinnie, E,
let's go.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.792
Awful.
Just awful.

04:52.875 --> 04:56.004
So boys, boys,
big week.

04:56.087 --> 04:59.424
Big week. The kind of
week that you will
remember your whole lives.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.718
Like the week that you
got your first blowjob.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.970
Do you remember
that week? I do.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.723
-Ninth grade.
-One of the boys on
the chess team, Ari?

05:06.806 --> 05:09.225
Oh, E.
You could never have
gotten this girl.

05:09.308 --> 05:12.895
Never. Beth Mariposa
had a mouth

05:12.979 --> 05:15.314
like a Dyson vacuum.
You know, never lost suction--

05:15.398 --> 05:17.775
Okay, Ari, big week.
Why are we here?

05:17.859 --> 05:19.694
-I want to talk business.
-Okay, shoot.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.113
Who are you taking to
the premiere? Shauna says
you're rolling solo.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.032
-No, I'm gonna
roll with the boys.
-No, no, no.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.743
You're not gonna roll
the red carpet with the three
musketeers. Not this time.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.203
-It's only two.
I'm bringing Sloan.
-Perfect.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.290
Let Vinnie walk the rug
with her. She's way too
hot for you anyway.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.167
-He's worried.
-Definitely.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.170
-What am I worried about?
-The movie. You're worried
it's not gonna open.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.796
This is why we should've
taken a job.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.673
Should we have taken
another job, Ari?

05:40.757 --> 05:43.801
You take a job after we open.
Any job you want.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.429
He always said,
"You take your nextb

05:46.512 --> 05:48.681
-before the last one opens."
-That was your quote.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.101
Yeah, but I amended that quote
when you got James Cameron
and the biggest movie ever.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.728
-He's nervous.
-Definitely.

05:53.811 --> 05:56.606
Boys, I am not nervous.
We are all good.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.232
But this is the biggest
night of your life.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.985
This is your coming out party.
This ain't<i> Head On.</i>

06:01.069 --> 06:03.738
We want to make
a statement here.
A statement that says,

06:03.821 --> 06:05.740
"I am a man now,
not a boy."

06:05.823 --> 06:07.408
Come on, let's be classy.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.827
You've been banging
every girl west of Sepulveda
for the past six months.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.081
Just pick the one skank
that's gonna photograph well
and be done with it. Boom!

06:13.164 --> 06:15.249
-Hey!
-That does sound classy.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.585
E, for the love of God,
help me out here.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.378
Look, I agree
it's a big night.
Okay?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.172
And if you're gonna take
someone you got to be smart.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.508
This girl's gonna be linked
to you for a long time

06:23.591 --> 06:26.302
-so she's got to
be premiere-worthy.
-Okay. All right.

06:26.385 --> 06:30.306
I just don't think any
of my west of Sepulveda
skanks fit the bill.

06:30.389 --> 06:33.851
Bottom line, there's only
one woman in my life

06:33.935 --> 06:35.686
who really is premiere-worthy.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.105
-Who?
-Ma.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.398
Aquamom!

06:39.482 --> 06:40.817
I love it.
Boom!

06:40.900 --> 06:43.319
There's no way Ma's
coming to L.A., bro.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.279
-No way.
-We'll see.

06:45.363 --> 06:48.157
You've never gotten her to
come before. What makes
you think she'll come now?

06:48.241 --> 06:49.784
-She won't.
-No way.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.619
-We'll see.
-Why do you keep saying
we'll see?

06:51.702 --> 06:53.454
-I've got a plan.
-What kind of plan?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.248
You'll see.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.959
<i>Power 106, Big Boy's</i>
<i>neighborhood.</i>

06:58.042 --> 07:01.838
Vincent Chase
is in the hood!

07:01.921 --> 07:04.632
The movie is<i> Aquaman.</i>
Premieres Wednesday.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.259
It's huge.
It's everywhere.

07:06.342 --> 07:10.096
My question to you, Vince,
is how is it?

07:10.179 --> 07:13.266
I begged Ma to come
to my<i> Viking Quest</i>
DVD release party.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.602
She said no.
What would possibly get
her to come to this?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.356
Turtle:
Look at these two.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.318
One on the left
is from the 50 Cent video.

07:24.402 --> 07:27.446
Ooh.
Video hos.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.906
I love it.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.825
What the fuck
are you looking at?

07:30.908 --> 07:32.493
(stammering)

07:32.577 --> 07:34.954
I'm just playing
with you, sweetie.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.665
(chuckles)

07:37.748 --> 07:41.502
Flirty video hos.
Even better.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.714
-So, Big Boy, I need a favor.
-Anything for Aquaman.
I got you.

07:44.797 --> 07:48.551
I need you to call the most
beautiful woman in the world

07:48.634 --> 07:50.428
and ask her if she'll be
my date for the premiere.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.639
That's done. Watch this.
Get Halle Berry on the phone
for him, man.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.058
Actually, Halle Berry
doesn't even

07:56.142 --> 07:57.852
hold a candle
to this woman.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.729
Okay, now you know--
roll him out.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.398
That's blasphemy.
That'll get you cut
up in here.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.525
-It's my mother.
-Big Boy: Okay, sorry.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.694
-Good plan.
-We'll see.

08:06.777 --> 08:09.614
Ma will not cave in
to public pressure.
No way.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.200
(ringing)

08:14.952 --> 08:17.788
-Hello? Yeah.
-Hello, Mrs. Chase?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.874
How're you doing?
It's Big Boy. You're live
on the radio.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.667
<i>Power 106 in Los Angeles.</i>

08:21.751 --> 08:24.462
If I haven't won anything,
let me save you the time.

08:24.545 --> 08:27.632
-Hey, Ma, don't hang up.
-Vincent, is that you?

08:27.715 --> 08:30.134
Yes, Ma, and we're live
so don't curse.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.596
-Big Boy: Please don't curse.
-What do you mean we're live?
Don't do this to me.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.848
Look, I'm standing here in
a robe. Don't do this to me.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.935
Ma, no one can see you.
Calm down and don't curse.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.854
What am I, some
kind of animal? Will you
please stop saying that?

08:41.938 --> 08:44.565
-Is your brother with you?
-Yeah, Ma, he's outside.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.192
<i>Has he gotten</i>
<i>any work yet?</i>

08:46.275 --> 08:48.152
Ma, don't worry about Johnny.
He's fine.

08:48.236 --> 08:52.281
We'll talk about him later.
I want to talk to you, okay?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.075
You're brothers?

08:54.158 --> 08:56.452
-Yeah.
-I'm a close cousin.

08:56.535 --> 08:59.580
<i>Over the radio</i>
<i>you need to talk to me?</i>
<i>What are you up to?</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:01.540
I want you to come to the L.A.
premiere with me.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.960
Vincent, this is not the forum
for this discussion.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.128
-She is not coming.
-Of course she's not coming.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.381
-What's the issues?
-She doesn't like to travel.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.508
-That's an issue.
-All right, all right.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.635
I don't need
the whole world thinking
I'm a lunatic, Vincent.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.471
Look, I haven't been out
of New York in 30 years, okay?

09:15.554 --> 09:17.473
-She's breaking.
-Not even close.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.601
-And putting me
live on the radio--
-Ma, you know what?

09:20.685 --> 09:24.605
Just forget about
the 100 million potentially
heartbroken listeners

09:24.689 --> 09:27.316
-and listen
to me for a second.
-Oh, fuck, Vincent.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.609
Whoa, Mrs. Chase!

09:28.693 --> 09:31.195
-Mama Gangster.
-I knew she'd curse.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.114
-That's 'cause
she's breaking.
-No way.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.616
-Ma.
<i>-Yeah, baby?</i>

09:35.700 --> 09:38.869
I love you and I've never
pressured you to come out.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.998
Not for any of my premieres,
not when I bought my house.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.501
But I didn't realize what
a big night this was till
a little while ago.

09:45.584 --> 09:48.296
And it's important to me
that I share it with you.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.840
So I'll send a boat,
I'll send a plane.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.633
I'll do whatever
I have to do,

09:52.717 --> 09:55.845
but I want you by my side
when I walk down that
red carpet.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.432
-This is moving shit.
-Still won't work.

09:59.515 --> 10:01.726
-Ma?
<i>-Vince.</i>

10:01.809 --> 10:03.978
-Yeah?
-All right.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.980

Got yourself a date!

10:13.821 --> 10:15.698
You got yourself a date!

10:15.781 --> 10:17.783
I can't believe it.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.994
She better come
to my next premiere.

10:20.077 --> 10:23.956
Hey, why don't you guys
take us to this premiere?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.460
-Yeah.
-Absolutely.

10:27.543 --> 10:30.171
There's no more tickets.
What do you guys want from me?

10:30.254 --> 10:32.006
-We want more tickets.
-Just two.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.674
Don't make
a big deal out of it.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.719
I'm still stinging
from the knowledge
that Ma favors Vince.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.512
Ari gave you guys
50 tickets.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.057
You want more
have Vince call him
and ask him. That's it.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.602
Vince, will you please
call Ari and ask him
for two more tickets?

10:44.685 --> 10:46.979
-No.
-Turtle: Oh please, Vince!

10:47.063 --> 10:49.357
We peaked too early.
You can't punish us for that.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.276
Yeah, how were we supposed
to know best in show would
appear so late?

10:52.360 --> 10:55.946
Let me ask you a question:
what's so special about
these two, huh?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.324
These two will fuck us
if we take 'em.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.159
-Guaranteed.
-How do you know?

11:00.242 --> 11:02.203
'Cause they said if you
take us, we'll fuck you.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.414
(laughs)
Call Ari.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.460
Are these for Vince
or are they more
for Turtle and Drama?

11:09.543 --> 11:12.630
-E:<i> They're for Vince, Ari.</i>
-Don't lie to me, E.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.091
Ari, your business manager's
on the phone.

11:15.174 --> 11:18.886
I'm in the gym until
11:30, Lloyd. I need two
more tickets for Vince.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.721
We don't have any more.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.516
Take two from Jimmy Woods,
he never uses them all anyway.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.726
Okay, but your
business manager, Ari.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.478
The gym, Lloyd.
The fucking gym!

11:27.561 --> 11:31.107
-It's pretty urgent.
-It's pretty urgent that
in the 15 minutes a day

11:31.190 --> 11:34.318
I have free,
I take the time
to keep this body fit.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.570
And not just so you have
a great ass to look at--

11:36.654 --> 11:38.197
I want to live.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.951
Ari, he says you bounced
a check to your kids' school.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.250
So you'll just send
those tickets over, Ari?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.835
Thanks.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.753
-(dial tone)
-(thuds)

11:52.837 --> 11:55.631
Okay, no wonder everyone
at the book drive was
staring at me.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.800
They were staring at you
because you're hot, okay?

11:57.883 --> 11:59.802
Look at all the other
mommies. They're ugly.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.804
This is so humiliating.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.181
I had no idea we were in
this bad of trouble, Ari.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.100
Look, it's not like
this was tuition.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.768
This was our
charitable donation.

12:07.852 --> 12:11.105
25,000-bucks-a-year tuition
so a 6-year-old

12:11.188 --> 12:14.525
can play with blocks
and they still want
a charitable donation?

12:14.608 --> 12:16.569
I mean, this won't
even affect our kids.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.320
We'll never have to see
the kids this affects.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.614
Ari, tell me
what you need now.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.908
Now that you ask, we've got
to pay off the staff,

12:22.992 --> 12:25.536
-we've got
rent on the office--
-What's the number?

12:25.619 --> 12:26.787
-I need 100 grand.
-Jesus!

12:26.871 --> 12:29.457
Come on, baby, listen.
I'm on fumes here.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.877
It'll float me until I get
the settlement from Terrance.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.630
Well, I have dipped
into my personal savings
five times already.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.382
What's mine is yours.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.427
-Sell your car.
-Sell your fucking watch.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.596
You eat at the Palm
four nights a week.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.890
Do I ever order the lobster?

12:45.973 --> 12:48.851
No, I order the Gigi Salad
and I sign clients.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.769
Honey, the master plan
is happening here.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.898
The seeds have been planted
all over this town.
You know that.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.900
Honey, they just need
a little water.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.319
You keep telling me that
but when are they gonna grow?

12:58.402 --> 13:01.030
Vinnie opens on Friday.
He is the first seed to bloom.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.907
He's gonna be the biggest
movie star on the planet.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.992
-You know that.
-No, Ari. I don't.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.453
Well, you need to know
that I know that, okay?

13:07.536 --> 13:09.914
And you need to trust
me the way you trust your
daddy's trust fund.

13:09.997 --> 13:12.333
All right? I mean,
you call them
personal savings,

13:12.416 --> 13:15.503
-but you haven't saved
shit personally.
-Whatever, Ari.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.713
My father put that money
aside for me

13:17.796 --> 13:19.673
in case something happened
to us and it's almost gone.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.384
But we're still here, and I
could've banged Heidi Klum
when she was 23

13:22.468 --> 13:25.346
but I took a pass, okay?
What the fuck is gonna make
me leave now?

13:25.429 --> 13:27.264
You could die.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.891
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

13:28.974 --> 13:32.728
Not until I saw that the life
insurance check didn't bounce.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.733
Ooh, what do you
think about this?

13:37.816 --> 13:40.528
Oh, I like it.
Ma would look great in that.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.821
What about this?

13:42.905 --> 13:46.158
-Look how excited you are.
-Does that make me a pussy?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.577
No, it makes you a man.
And a very handsome one.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.538
-Now what size is she?
-I don't know. E?

13:50.621 --> 13:53.749
A, I don't know women's dress
sizes. And B, I don't look
at your mom's body.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.544
You don't?
I look at your mom's.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.546
Shut the fuck up.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.923
We'll take this whole
rack in different sizes.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.259
Nice when you're on
commissions, huh, sweetheart?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.678
Now let's go find me a dress
that makes my tits pop.

14:05.761 --> 14:08.264
Jeez, and you have me
walking up.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.015
Do you know how much
these shoes cost?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.476
Of course I know how much
they cost, Stephanie.
I fucking paid for them.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.063
And you told me I was
gonna meet Jim Cameron.
When did that happen?

14:16.146 --> 14:18.232
-Oh, it's Jim now.
-We were supposed to
have lunch last week.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.442
-Jim Cameron, I love that.

to James Woods.

15:04.987 --> 15:08.032

That sucks.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.784
Uh, yes, it sucks.
And I need them back.

-Fuck that.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.080
Uh, Johnny--

15:15.164 --> 15:17.374
Lloyd, possession
is two-fifths of the law.

-Just get Woods two more.
-Turtle, there are no more

15:19.877 --> 15:23.047

is very unhappy and he
wants them back.

15:23.130 --> 15:26.216

but you tell
Jimmy Woods--

15:26.300 --> 15:28.010

from me personally--

you're not thinking.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.588
What do you hope
he's not thinking?

20:14.671 --> 20:17.716
-Make the call to her.
-I'm not making the call.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.552
I'm making the call,

Now make the fucking call.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.138
-What call?
-Turtle: This will
ruin the whole night.

20:23.221 --> 20:26.850
It's not your night,
Turtle. It's Vince's night.
Make the call.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.644
Aw fuck.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.064
-What time is it
back east?
-10:30.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.401
Will someone please
tell me how you did this?

20:36.485 --> 20:40.781
-Oh, quit your whining.
-Seriously, what do you want
to ruin the surprise for?

20:40.864 --> 20:44.284
Just worry about how
you're gonna get Ma to
my next big event, bro.

20:44.368 --> 20:47.621
The good news is you'll
have plenty of time
to plan for that one.

You're funny.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.377
Ma! Ma!

20:53.460 --> 20:56.213
I can't believe this.
How did you do it?

20:56.296 --> 21:00.050
Holy shit!

When you're doing

it's even more critical
that everything be

really breathe underwater.
