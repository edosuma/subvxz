00:02.306 --> 00:03.960
[female narrator]
Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:04.047 --> 00:05.483
into the scandalous lives
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.964
I've decided to take over
Bass Industries.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.488
There is one stipulation
that should you in any way

00:10.575 --> 00:12.882
'act inappropriately,
the board has the option'

00:12.969 --> 00:15.319
'to replace you
with your legal guardian'

00:15.406 --> 00:17.321
which wouldn't
you know it, is me.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.976
I had enough trouble with
the idea of mom and Rufus dating

00:20.063 --> 00:22.892
but now I share a sibling
with my boyfriend?

00:22.979 --> 00:24.676
[Lilian]
'Maybe we weren't meant
to be a family.'

00:24.763 --> 00:26.548
[Berube]
'Serena, Dean Berube.'

00:26.635 --> 00:28.158
'I'd like to issue
a press release'

00:28.245 --> 00:30.813
that you came up
to visit our glorious campus.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.642
Princeton is a trade school.
There is only Yale.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.688
He said that Yale could really
use a girl like Blair Waldorf.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.821
[laughs]
Oh, B. I'm so happy for you.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.260
[female narrator]
And who am I?

00:43.347 --> 00:45.045
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.526
You know you love me.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.528
XOXO.

00:50.615 --> 00:51.747
Gossip Girl.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.967
True love and betrayal

00:55.055 --> 00:57.274
revenge and more revenge.

00:57.361 --> 00:59.798
A heroine
with an impossible goal

00:59.885 --> 01:02.758
if only Mozart had lived
on the Upper East Side.

01:02.845 --> 01:05.108
[Harold]
'Blair bear,
you'll be late!'

01:05.195 --> 01:07.415
But you can keep
your magic flute, Amadeus.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.026
All this queen wants is
a golden ticket to Yale.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.723
You look like a firing squad.

01:11.810 --> 01:15.771
More like a welcoming committee.
It's the big day.

01:15.858 --> 01:17.555
[sighs]

01:17.642 --> 01:19.688
It's all the color of Yale.
You see?

01:19.775 --> 01:21.298
That's just what I need
to perk me up.

01:21.385 --> 01:23.300
- I couldn't sleep a wink.
- We know.

01:23.387 --> 01:24.693
We heard you watching
"Gilmore Girls"

01:24.780 --> 01:26.608
all night, again.

01:26.695 --> 01:30.438
Oh, I am so a better fit
for Yale than that Rory.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.135
Dorota.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.354
Don't be sad.

01:33.441 --> 01:35.356
I'm not going
anywhere for six months.

01:35.443 --> 01:38.837
[laughs]
That wasn't Dorota, dear.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.013
That was handsome Dan.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.406
Oh!

01:42.493 --> 01:43.929
Oh.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.322
- Look at him.
- Yeah.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.063
- He's a gift from all of us.
- Oh.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.456
He's the Yale mascot,
a bulldog.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.153
- Oh.
- Just like you after today.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.459
I don't know
about the name, though.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.156
We should just call him
"Handsome."

01:53.243 --> 01:55.115
You're adorable.

01:55.202 --> 01:58.379
Yes, just don't look
behind the sofa.

01:58.466 --> 02:01.382
No, you're a shoe-in, darling.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.123
- Mademoiselle.
- Merci.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.255
A shoe-in.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.952
The personal letter
that I wrote to Dean Berube

02:07.039 --> 02:09.433
should simply...cinch it.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.479
We will celebrate your
acceptance tonight at the opera

02:11.566 --> 02:13.524
with champagne
at all intermissions.

02:13.611 --> 02:17.180
We will be so drunk, by the time
someone dies, we'll just laugh.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.487
Is Chuck joining us?

02:19.574 --> 02:21.358
You know how he loves
a good tragedy.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.795
Yes. Where is Mr. Chuck?

02:23.882 --> 02:25.710
I wouldn't know,
and I don't care.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.495
He's as dead to me
as his father is to him.

02:27.582 --> 02:28.713
More blueberries.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.288
Whew! Yale day.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.464
- Good morning.
- Mm.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.510
I thought we could walk
to school together for support.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.555
I keep telling myself that
everything happens for a reason.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.296
You know, I'll-I'll end up
in the right place

02:46.383 --> 02:47.993
but what if I don't get in?

02:48.080 --> 02:50.735
Pfft. Forget you.
What if I do and Blair doesn't?

02:50.822 --> 02:53.390
Fire and-and brimstone
and a lot of bitchy asides

02:53.477 --> 02:54.913
death by Dorota.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.524
Thanks. You don't have
to worry either.

02:56.611 --> 02:57.829
Blair's a lock.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.918
The dean told her
as much, right?

03:00.005 --> 03:02.356
Yeah. Yeah, Yale is good.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.053
We're good.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.097
Everything will be fine.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.883
[laughs]

03:07.970 --> 03:09.972
You're referring
to the recent not fun event

03:10.059 --> 03:12.888
uh, also known
as the "You Two Share A Brother

03:12.975 --> 03:14.629
Oh, Wait, No, You Don't"
roller coaster.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.109
[chuckles]
Not to be outdone
by the tilt-a-whirl

03:17.197 --> 03:19.286
called "Discovering this fact
has only served

03:19.373 --> 03:21.636
to just bringing Rufus and Lily
closer than ever."

03:21.723 --> 03:24.334
Look, getting into Yale
will change our lives.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.858
It'll give us a chance
to reinvent ourselves.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.077
Yeah.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.774
Yeah, and in the meantime

03:29.861 --> 03:32.124
at least our parents are
keeping it on the down low.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.824
- Yeah.
- Rufus, stop it.

03:35.911 --> 03:36.912
Oh, hello.

03:39.610 --> 03:43.005
I was planning on sneaking out
before anyone got up

03:43.092 --> 03:44.746
but Lily and I
got to bed so late.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.835
Oh, you don't-you-
that's-just stop there.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.316
Right.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.448
Well, now that this is
all out in the open

03:51.535 --> 03:53.842
maybe we can
stop sneaking around.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.714
I mean, we've had the awkward
run-in, and it isn't so bad.

03:56.801 --> 03:59.978
I don't know why we thought
this would be so weird.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.850
- Let's leave now.
- Nice try, mom.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.939
Yeah, seriously good effort.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.723
So I was thinking, tonight..

04:05.810 --> 04:07.290
More than four hours
of sleep?

04:07.377 --> 04:10.989
That, and there is
a charity gala at the opera.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.601
- A full 12 hours then.
- Oh, everyone will be there.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.559
It's the-it's the event
of the season

04:15.646 --> 04:18.170
and I'm really feeling ready
to get back to the world.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.477
Aren't you worried about people
seeing us together so soon?

04:20.564 --> 04:23.915
The kids know.
Why shouldn't the world?

04:24.002 --> 04:27.223
And, uh, we might as well make
our society debut in style.

04:27.310 --> 04:30.052
I was just trying to get out of
the opera part, I'm not a fan.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.314
Well, you can become
one tonight.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.315
Mm.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.405
[opens and closes drawer]

04:35.492 --> 04:39.017
I would say, "Get a room,"
but yours is rightabove mine.

04:39.104 --> 04:40.149
Please try to remember that.

04:42.456 --> 04:43.979
Oh, my God.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.332
[knock on door]

04:49.419 --> 04:51.203
[Charles]
'No, I told you, under 18'

04:51.291 --> 04:52.814
'and I want verification.'

04:52.901 --> 04:55.425
I don't care where you have
to import them from.

04:55.512 --> 04:58.036
'I want them young
and unstable.'

04:58.123 --> 04:59.473
You can cancel that order.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.604
'I already ate.'

05:02.258 --> 05:03.781
I'll get right back to you.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.044
Your Bush league attempts

05:06.131 --> 05:07.742
to take me down,
they're getting boring.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.657
'Although, I must admit
having the freshman class'

05:09.744 --> 05:12.050
'of Brearley hold their annual
sleepover in my hotel room'

05:12.137 --> 05:13.487
that was a nice touch.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.140
By the way, don't be alarmed

05:15.227 --> 05:17.578
'but, uh, our stock might take
a little dip today.'

05:17.665 --> 05:19.319
I'm still adjusting
to a learning curve.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.060
No, what you're doing
is trying too hard.

05:22.147 --> 05:23.932
You're obviously
not cut out for the job

05:24.019 --> 05:27.022
which is why Bart never let you
out of the outback.

05:27.109 --> 05:29.503
You should be more careful.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.504
Or what?

05:31.766 --> 05:33.071
It's mycompany now, kid.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.812
You saw to that.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.946
Will the, uh, board and I be
seeing you at the opera tonight?

05:38.033 --> 05:39.513
Even though you're
no longer in charge

05:39.600 --> 05:42.298
you are still the public face
of the company.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.213
I think it's
important you display it.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.997
Show there's
no hard feelings.

05:46.084 --> 05:49.653
Maybe I'll show them they made
the wrong choice instead.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.047
Oh, wait, you're already
doing that for me, aren't you?

05:52.134 --> 05:53.701
No matter.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.399
We probably won't be seeing
much of each other anyway.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.140
I'll be
in your father's seats

05:58.227 --> 06:00.838
'and you'll be,
well...somewhere else.'

06:07.018 --> 06:08.890
[school bell rings]

06:12.067 --> 06:13.111
[Dan]
'Who's a new kid?'

06:13.198 --> 06:14.286
That "kid" is

06:14.374 --> 06:15.505
my Shakespeare
teacher, Miss Carr.

06:15.592 --> 06:16.941
That-that's Miss Carr?

06:17.028 --> 06:18.378
Does she have
Benjamin Button syndrome?

06:18.465 --> 06:19.988
[chuckles]
Here, let us help you.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.468
- It's alright.
- Oh, thank you, Serena.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.339
It's like holding a door
never occurred to anybody.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.167
No, not on the Upper East Side.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.603
These kids have probably never
touched a door in their life.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.605
They just magically open
for them, don't they?

06:31.434 --> 06:33.305
Oh, uh, this is my boyfriend
Dan Humphrey.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.046
- Hi.
- Dan, this is Miss Carr.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.353
- She's my favorite new teacher.
- 'Yeah, heard a lot about you.'

06:37.440 --> 06:38.876
'Although I-I wasn't expecting
you to look so..'

06:38.963 --> 06:41.009
- Out of place?
- No, I was gonna say "young."

06:41.096 --> 06:42.140
You could pass for a student.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.751
Well, I was, until recently.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.405
I've been doing
"Teach For America"

06:45.492 --> 06:46.536
the past two years in Alabama.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.059
'This is my first salaried job.'

06:48.146 --> 06:50.105
I've never even been
to New York before.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.889
It's a lot different
than Des Moines.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.544
My family is in the hotel
business and the palace lobby

06:54.631 --> 06:56.328
is a wonderful place
to get away from the noise.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.939
[Dan]
'Yeah, you know,
if you're ever in Brooklyn'

06:58.026 --> 06:59.810
my dad has a gallery,
there's a pretty cool cafe.

06:59.897 --> 07:02.770
Brooklyn, that's, uh, the place
across the bridge, right?

07:02.857 --> 07:05.163
Ha ha. Yeah.
You'll fit in just fine here.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.643
Oh, hey, don't let the city
get to you.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.689
- See you third period.
- Mm-hm.

07:08.776 --> 07:11.039
- Nice meeting you, Daniel.
- Nice meeting you, Miss Carr.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.173
So good luck today.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.914
You, too.
May the best get in.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.526
[laughs]
Mm.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.789
Refresh. Refresh. Refresh.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.181
That's not my Eli account.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.618
No, it's mine.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.967
I applied to Yale, too,
remember?

07:26.054 --> 07:27.751
Yes, but your application was

07:27.838 --> 07:30.406
merely a formality to appease
your overbearing parents.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.103
You know very well
there's no way Yale is

07:32.190 --> 07:35.455
going to accept someone
who got a 2360 on her SATS

07:35.542 --> 07:37.413
so give up
and go for the gold, my gold.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.719
Refresh.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.200
Hey, are you going
to the opera thing tonight?

07:42.287 --> 07:44.202
Um, yeah.
Serena's taking me.

07:44.289 --> 07:46.553
Yeah? I might go, too.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.772
'You know, for a while,
I couldn't take Vanessa'

07:48.859 --> 07:51.340
anywhere really nice, 'cause
of the whole no money thing

07:51.427 --> 07:55.387
but I saw a DVD of "the ring"
cycle at her house and I figured

07:55.475 --> 07:57.259
she might like some champagne
in my family's box.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.652
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

07:58.739 --> 07:59.783
Don't tell her you saw
that DVD though

07:59.870 --> 08:01.393
'cause I-I pointed it out once

08:01.481 --> 08:02.960
and she made me watch the whole
thing with no subtitles.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.440
If you've ever seen
"A Clockwork Orange"

08:04.527 --> 08:05.963
then you know how that ended up.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.530
Wait.
What's "A Clockwork Orange?"

08:07.617 --> 08:08.923
[cell phone alert chirps]

08:20.064 --> 08:21.457
[clears throat]

08:21.544 --> 08:23.677
Charles, I didn't expect
to see youtoday.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.853
Or ever,
if I had it my way.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.638
Yes, well,
I missed you, too.

08:28.725 --> 08:29.857
I'm trying to do something.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.078
I really wanted to do it
on my own.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.471
But that's not working.

08:37.647 --> 08:40.345
I'm thinking you're the only
person left who can help.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.266
What do you say?

[cell phones beeping]

09:01.932 --> 09:03.238
- What are you guys doing?
- Shh.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.022
Don't talk to them.
They're working.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.502
Refresh.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.591
[cell phone alerts ding]
Oh..

09:08.678 --> 09:09.853
- My..
- God.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.246
What? What is it?

09:21.169 --> 09:23.998
I'm sorry, I..
I simply can't read it.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.216
'The font's too small.'

09:25.303 --> 09:26.653
I have to check it
on a real computer.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.571
It says "wait-listed" in bold.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.750
- I got in. I did it. I got in.
- Oh, my gosh!

09:36.837 --> 09:38.229
I can't believe it.
Oh, did you?

09:38.316 --> 09:39.970
Um..

09:41.581 --> 09:45.454
No. No, no. Um, I'm wait-listed.
Just like Blair.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.760
Well, don't worry.
You'll get in.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.196
'We'll be together next fall.'

09:48.283 --> 09:49.893
Even if you have to wait
another couple of months

09:49.980 --> 09:53.331
to find out for sure,
it's all good, or it will be.

09:53.418 --> 09:54.594
Yeah, I know it will.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.772
[Blair]
'I need to see
the headmistress.'

10:00.904 --> 10:02.689
Right now!

10:02.776 --> 10:06.083
They say that it's not over
till the fat lady sings.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.173
But who's that I hear
tuning up in the wings?

10:09.260 --> 10:11.611
Sorry, B.
I think it's curtains.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.224
All my usual moves
haven't worked.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.269
Jack is blood.

10:18.356 --> 10:20.881
He thinks too much like me,
he sees me coming.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.491
And the way
he's running the business

10:22.578 --> 10:26.234
I worry everything my father
had worked for will be lost.

10:26.321 --> 10:29.280
Since you're part of the company
now, I thought you might care.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.239
I do care, Charles.

10:31.326 --> 10:34.068
But my concern is for you,
not the company.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.636
You're living alone.
Why don't you move back in here?

10:36.723 --> 10:38.420
It'll make it a lot easier
to work together.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.509
I'm not interested
in a family reunion

10:40.596 --> 10:44.078
nor in assuaging your guilt
over my father's death.

10:44.165 --> 10:45.645
Do you believe
in my cause or not?

10:45.732 --> 10:47.168
I do.

10:47.255 --> 10:50.475
But your shenanigans,

with a transsexual hooker..

10:55.959 --> 10:57.831
the negative light
on you in the board's eyes.

10:57.918 --> 11:00.007
I don't care
about the board anymore.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.097
You should. You need them.

11:03.184 --> 11:06.056
'So let me help you by handling
this like a grownup.'

11:06.143 --> 11:09.190
My 20% stake
in Bass Industries

11:09.277 --> 11:12.672
'must count for something,
and when I'm done..'

11:12.759 --> 11:15.022
...perhaps you'll reconsider
your living situation.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.417
Don't hold your breath.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.468
Meet me here at two?

11:27.904 --> 11:29.036
[Blair]
'How did this happen?'

11:29.123 --> 11:31.255
Dean Berube said
I was a perfect fit.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.953
His exact words were

11:33.040 --> 11:35.346
"Yale could use a girl
like Blair Waldorf."

11:35.433 --> 11:37.392
Well, apparently,
they found one somewhere else.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.611
Calm yourself.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.570
When I spoke to Dean Berube
this morning

11:41.657 --> 11:43.964
'he assured me that
if the student they've accepted'

11:44.051 --> 11:46.836
turns them down,
you are next in line.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.882
Dan Humphrey?

11:48.969 --> 11:51.798
He's like a cafeteria lady
who won the lottery.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.756
You couldn't pry that acceptance
from his hands

11:53.843 --> 11:55.192
with the jaws of life.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.151
I wasn't speaking
about Mr. Humphrey.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.503
Someone from Constance
got in?

12:01.590 --> 12:04.985
Blair, in our school's history,
most wait-listed students

12:05.072 --> 12:07.683
ultimately get into
the college of their choice.

12:07.770 --> 12:11.861
Your transcript is
a series of unblemished A's.

12:11.948 --> 12:15.473
All you have to do is keep up
your GPA, and you'll get in.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.954
I know
that patience and trust

12:18.041 --> 12:20.043
aren't necessarily
your strong suits

12:20.130 --> 12:22.872
but you'll just have to rise
to the occasion, hmm?

12:26.093 --> 12:28.617
Thank you.
I'm sure I can do that.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.752
Just tell me who got in.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.579
You got in?
Congratulations.

12:34.666 --> 12:37.234
Oh, shh. Don't say it too loud.
I haven't told anyone yet.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.236
Not even Dan,
especially not Blair.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.238
- Well, why not?
- Oh, I-I couldn't.

12:41.325 --> 12:44.067
She was wait-listed.
It would have been a disaster.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.852
A word
of unsolicited advice

12:45.939 --> 12:47.592
it sounds like you're
worrying about other people

12:47.679 --> 12:49.638
when this is
a decision about you.

12:49.725 --> 12:50.857
Do you want Yale?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.383
Do you know
you're the first person

12:55.470 --> 12:57.298
that's ever asked me that?

12:57.385 --> 13:00.388
The truth is,
I don't-I don't know.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.433
The whole reason I went there
in the first place

13:02.520 --> 13:06.350
was because of Blair, and then
I applied because of Dan.

13:06.437 --> 13:09.527
Honestly, I think Yale
might be accepting me

13:09.614 --> 13:11.442
for the wrong reasons.

13:11.529 --> 13:14.794
I would never advise anyone to
turn down a great opportunity

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
but going to
the right school for you

13:16.926 --> 13:20.060
is the most important thing.

13:20.147 --> 13:22.714
Serena, did you hear
someone from Constance got in?

13:22.802 --> 13:24.412
I bet it's that little Nelly.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.196
When I find her,
she's not gonna know..

13:27.676 --> 13:29.504
- Hello.
- Blair.

13:29.591 --> 13:31.549
- I missed you first period.
- I had a meeting.

13:31.636 --> 13:34.639
You also missed
getting this back.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.076
I'll talk
to you later, Serena.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.120
Bye.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.167
Well, if you're on a witch hunt

13:40.254 --> 13:42.560
that means you can't
be too upset, right?

13:42.647 --> 13:45.041
Witch hunts
are my Valium, Serena.

13:45.128 --> 13:47.304
I'm just trying
to stay calm.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.089
What about you?

13:49.176 --> 13:51.526
I have to say, I'm totally
surprised, Yale passed up

13:51.613 --> 13:54.616
the P.R. Of accepting "It" girl,
Serena Van Der Woodsen.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.313
They have more class
than I thought.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.447
Well, like you pointed out,
they didn't want me for me.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.665
Dan must be pissed.

14:01.971 --> 14:03.494
His hope of arriving on campus

14:03.581 --> 14:05.192
with cachet
has been shot to hell.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.715

with the rest

aid-iots and poets.

Oh, my God.

'This is Shirley
from Dean Berube's office.'

'The dean would love
to issue a press release'

'that you'll be joining Yale's
freshman class in the fall'

'assuming you're accepting.'

14:29.216 --> 14:32.088
'Would you mind?
Miss Van Der Woodsen?'

14:32.175 --> 14:34.525
Um, I-I-I'm gonna have to
call you back.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.965
Charles has left us
no choice.

14:39.052 --> 14:41.141
We wish you had been left
in charge of the company

14:41.228 --> 14:43.534
of course, but that's
not how it laid out.

14:43.621 --> 14:44.622
Well, surely
there must be something--

14:44.709 --> 14:46.537
Jack is Charles' guardian

14:46.624 --> 14:49.540
and the contract clearly states
that his guardian has control.

14:49.627 --> 14:52.152
Short of being able to prove
he's completely negligent

14:52.239 --> 14:55.068
all we can do is our best
to temper his actions.

14:57.157 --> 14:59.899
Aww.
Minority shareholders' meeting.

15:01.596 --> 15:02.814
We were just finishing up.

15:04.686 --> 15:05.992
See you soon,
I hope, Lilian?

15:06.079 --> 15:07.384
Yes, Peter, I'd like that.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.519
Had I known my own personal
Mata Hari was going to be here

15:11.606 --> 15:12.912
I would have come sooner.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.826
Yes, well, I was
just being brought up to date

15:14.914 --> 15:17.438
on your progress
or lack thereof.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.222
I'll right myself eventually.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.529
I just have to get
my legs under me.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.271
Maybe the two of us could
come together in some way

15:24.358 --> 15:28.492
help me find my strength...
or use it all up.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.364
- What's that for?
- Your nose.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.757
You don't seem so worried
about the same morality clause

15:32.844 --> 15:34.020
that cost Charles his company.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.762
They won't touch me.

15:37.849 --> 15:40.765
Although I may not
be doing a bang-up job yet

15:40.852 --> 15:43.377
it beats having a woman
of your reputation at the helm.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.741
[indistinct conversations]

15:59.828 --> 16:01.699
- This is a "B."
- Yes, it is.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.486
You're new here,
so you don't know how it works.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.488
I have a feeling
you're about to explain.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.490
Second semester seniors
get a free pass

16:09.577 --> 16:12.449
like pregnant ladies
or 14-year-old Chinese gymnast.

16:12.536 --> 16:15.148
Constance wants their students
to get into the best colleges.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.324
That's why
this free pass exists.

16:17.411 --> 16:20.501
The headmistress,
if she knew about this grade

16:20.588 --> 16:22.938
she'd rap you on the wrist.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.722
Maybe in time,
I'll get in trouble

16:24.809 --> 16:27.595
for not inflating grades like
everyone else, Miss Waldorf

16:27.682 --> 16:31.381
but until then,
I'll give them based on merit.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.296
I need to keep my GPA perfect
to get into Yale.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.863
You should have thought
of that before.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.439
What's wrong?

16:45.526 --> 16:48.746
I think I might have
just lost Yale.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.226
What am I gonna do?

16:51.793 --> 16:53.490
I didn't apply anywhere else.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.236
Just hold on a second.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.890
There's a phone call
I have to return.

[sighs]

17:10.203 --> 17:12.335
The bastard is untouchable.

17:12.422 --> 17:13.423
Well, what should we do?

17:13.510 --> 17:15.469
Time to get dirty.
I'm all ears.

17:15.556 --> 17:17.993
Let me educate you.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.778
Did you really try to buy
Anthrax with his credit card?

17:20.865 --> 17:22.998
The black market
isn't what it used to be.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.392
And you got him
on Megan's list?

17:25.479 --> 17:26.828
If only his apartment were

17:26.915 --> 17:30.310
a few blocks
closer to a playground.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.008
Look, I understand why you're
trying to do these things

17:33.095 --> 17:35.576
but we have got to do something
that is not illegal.

17:35.663 --> 17:36.968
'I've put calls'

17:37.056 --> 17:38.970
into Jack's business
associates in Australia.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.885
He's not
the most upstanding citizen.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.670
I'm sure
we will find something.

17:45.020 --> 17:49.024
You know, I, um, I thought I
lost you the day of the funeral

17:49.111 --> 17:50.460
and, um, I'm sorry that Jack's

17:50.547 --> 17:51.809
the one to bring
us back together

17:51.896 --> 17:54.682
but, I'm glad
that we're doing this.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.075
If your people don't come up
with anything

17:56.162 --> 17:57.859
maybe we could try number 26.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.558
"Crash Jack in plane."

18:01.645 --> 18:03.908
[chuckles]

18:03.995 --> 18:06.520
The Bass jet is
kind of expensive, Charles.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.217
[cell phone rings]
There's insurance.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.134
Hello?

18:12.221 --> 18:14.354
Yes.
Yeah, that would be fine.

really talk right now.

Yes, the, uh, the opera
has an early curtain.

'Okay, okay.
I'll see you then.'

18:26.366 --> 18:28.281
- Bye.
- I can't believe you.

18:28.368 --> 18:29.934
You're actually going to take

18:30.021 --> 18:32.372
your half-price hustler
out on the town tonight.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.637
I thought we were putting this
behind us, Charles.

18:36.724 --> 18:37.899
I'm here to help you.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.422
And what part
of you dating someone else

18:39.509 --> 18:41.381
a month after my father's death
is helping me?

18:43.383 --> 18:46.734
You say you want to be family,
but if you really meant it

18:46.821 --> 18:49.911
you wouldn't parade
your mistress in public.

18:49.998 --> 18:53.654
You'd have some tact,
some respect.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.482
This isn't about
your father, Charles.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.962
I should have known from your
history I couldn't count on you.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.529
'You think of yourself.'

18:59.616 --> 19:04.230
Your kids and my dead father...
are proof of that.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.066

Hey, Serena.
Hey.

could go to Yale this weekend

Yes, she's gonna go.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.473
Would you excuse me
for a second?

19:32.780 --> 19:33.737
Not really.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.740
I know that look.
You're up to no good.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.394
[scoffs]
Good is subjective and if you

19:38.481 --> 19:40.135
don't believe me
you can look it up.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.006
You want to get Rachel back
for the grade she gave you.

19:42.093 --> 19:44.226
A new teacher's like a child.
It has to be taught.

19:44.313 --> 19:45.619
And spanked.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.316
And I can't risk
not getting into Yale

19:47.403 --> 19:49.666
so it's open season
on Miss Iowa.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.059
Time to shuck the corn.

19:53.888 --> 19:54.976
I wasn't supposed
to say anything

19:55.063 --> 19:56.760
but you-you aregoing to Yale.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.153
You got in, an early admission.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.982
- What?
- How do you know that?

20:01.069 --> 20:02.418
Because I declined
my acceptance.

20:02.505 --> 20:03.767
You're next in line.

20:03.854 --> 20:05.552
'They're gonna call you
in a couple hours.'

20:05.639 --> 20:06.770
Whoa. You-You got in?

20:06.857 --> 20:09.120
You're
the Constance student?

20:09.208 --> 20:12.036
Cancel the Nelly Yuki
project now!

20:12.123 --> 20:14.909
S, why would you
turn down Yale?

20:14.996 --> 20:16.954
And don't say for me, because
even I wouldn't believe you.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.218
Yeah, why-why
would you do that?

20:19.305 --> 20:22.699
I'm-I'm sorry.
I-I wanted to tell you.

20:22.786 --> 20:23.787
[laughter]
Oh, my God.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.180
You don't want to go?

20:27.704 --> 20:29.837
No. No, I don't.

20:33.493 --> 20:34.755
No, please.
I'll-I'll see you later.

20:38.672 --> 20:41.501
So-So you're not gonna
go after Rachel now, right?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.503
What would be the point?

20:43.590 --> 20:46.288
[both laugh]

20:46.375 --> 20:50.292
Okay, okay, hey, so the reason
I asked you to come down..

20:50.379 --> 20:51.859
No, wait, wait, wait.
Me first.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.165
Okay, ever since
you got your money back

20:54.253 --> 20:55.776
you've been taking me to do
all these Archibald-y things.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.996
Which I love.
I just can't keep up.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.261
So I decided
to do something for us.

21:02.348 --> 21:05.089
We're going
to the opera tonight.

21:05.176 --> 21:07.048
Wow. That is fantastic.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.745
They're nosebleed seats,
but at least they're something

21:08.832 --> 21:10.138
and Igot them.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.184
So what did you
bring me up here for anyway?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.883
Well, there's no reason.
I just wanted to see you.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.276
Oh!

21:20.017 --> 21:21.541
[both laugh]

21:23.499 --> 21:26.807
[singing "Der Holle Rache Kocht
In Meinem Herzen"]

21:26.894 --> 21:28.548
And then,
the-the queen of the night

21:28.635 --> 21:30.245
sings this kick-ass aria

21:30.332 --> 21:32.682
"Der Holle Rache Kocht
In Meinem Herzen"

21:32.769 --> 21:35.511
"The vengeance of hell
boils in my heart."

21:35.598 --> 21:37.818
- Lovely.
- Yeah, it is.

21:37.905 --> 21:40.429
It reaches a high "F" that,
that never happens in operas.

21:40.516 --> 21:41.691
You know, that's a good fact.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.127
You should talk about it
at intermission.

21:43.214 --> 21:44.825
You're gonna love
"The Magic Flute."

21:44.912 --> 21:48.437
- It's, uh, well, it's..
- It's okay. You can say it.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.657
...opera for amateurs.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.746
If anybody asks you what
you thought, just tell 'em

21:52.833 --> 21:54.748
"Ist war wunderschien.
Danke. Und sie?"

21:54.835 --> 21:56.053
That's what Klaus
always used to say.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.664
Well, that
and-and "Geh zum teufel"

21:57.751 --> 22:00.536
but, um, whatever you do,
don't-don't say that.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.103
Okay, this is ridiculous.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.366
Dad, Lily loves you 'cause
you're not that guy.

22:04.453 --> 22:05.802
Uh, this feels
a little different.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.717
- Only 'cause you're letting it.
- No, he's right.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.153
[Eric]
'In our world,
people say one thing'

22:09.240 --> 22:10.764
but they expect something else.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.026
If you can hold your own,
it'll go a long way

22:12.113 --> 22:13.897
with my mom and her friends.

22:13.984 --> 22:17.988
Everyone can geh zum teufel.
I just want to do right by her.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.991
Let's talk "Singspiel,"
shall we?

22:21.078 --> 22:22.210
"Singspiel."

22:27.041 --> 22:28.869
The devil would say,
"You're already in Yale.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.436
"You have security.

22:30.523 --> 22:33.134
"Now more than ever,
you can do what you want."

22:35.789 --> 22:38.357
And an angel would say,
"All the more reason not to.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.532
"You have what you want."

22:41.577 --> 22:43.405
You don't have
a perfect transcript.

22:43.492 --> 22:46.365
But you don't needone.
You're in.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.410
Ugh! I hate having
to play the angel.

22:48.497 --> 22:51.631
I know.
The devil is so much better.

22:51.718 --> 22:53.415
So, B, who won?

22:57.027 --> 22:57.985
Gimme.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.468
[cell phone beeping]

23:04.078 --> 23:06.341
Hello, Miss Carr?
It's Blair Waldorf.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.299
How did you get my number?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.345
[Blair]
'I wanted to apologize
for my behavior earlier.'

23:10.432 --> 23:12.478
I was hoping you'd afford me
the chance to move past it.

23:12.565 --> 23:14.436
I'd like that too

23:14.523 --> 23:16.917
but couldn't this have waited
till we saw each other again?

23:17.004 --> 23:18.658
That's precisely
why I'm calling.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.007
Did you know the school
has a block of tickets

23:20.094 --> 23:21.225
to the opera tonight?

23:21.312 --> 23:23.924
To the opera?
No, I didn't know that.

23:24.011 --> 23:26.970
'Oh, yes, it's a gala event
and my family'

23:27.057 --> 23:30.060
who's heard all about you, asked
if you could come to dinner

23:30.147 --> 23:33.237
and then join us in our
grand tier seats afterwards.

23:33.324 --> 23:36.197
I don't think that's such
a good idea in light of today

23:36.284 --> 23:37.894
or at all.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.680
Nonsense.
We have an extra ticket.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.160
You're not gonna let
our little disagreement

23:43.247 --> 23:44.727
stand in the way
of the opera?

23:46.033 --> 23:49.384
I-I havealways wanted to go.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.517
- Do you have a pen handy?
- Yeah.

23:51.604 --> 23:54.258
Spotted. B Hot for teacher.

23:54.345 --> 23:55.999
Too bad Miss Carr
doesn't remember

23:56.086 --> 23:58.524
the devil is in the details.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.439
What do you say the boathouse
in Central Park?

24:00.526 --> 24:03.224
We meet at 6:30 and walk over
for curtain at eight.

24:03.311 --> 24:04.965
Thank you.
Sounds wonderful.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.184
Yes. Yes, it does.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.928
[all laugh]

24:12.015 --> 24:13.930
Uh-huh!

24:14.017 --> 24:15.149

[Rufus]
'So if you
get into Yale..'

24:24.811 --> 24:27.640
Oh, and you go to Brown, you did
still apply there, right?

24:27.727 --> 24:29.816
- Yeah.
- 'That means two trips for us.'

24:29.903 --> 24:31.426
[Lilian]
'Or one, we could go
to Providence first'

24:31.513 --> 24:32.993
and then hit New Haven
on the way back.

24:33.080 --> 24:34.081
[Rufus]
'And stop
at the Newport creamery'

24:34.168 --> 24:35.648
'on the way down
for milkshakes.'

24:35.735 --> 24:37.780
My gosh, we could take
a week, we could take our time.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.695
New England is solovely
in the fall.

24:39.782 --> 24:40.783
We could bring
Jenny and Eric.

24:40.870 --> 24:41.828
That sounds great.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.352
I can't wait.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.878
[piano music]

24:50.750 --> 24:52.795
Box two. Uh, row two.
Two for you.

24:52.882 --> 24:53.970
Thanks.
You know what?

24:54.057 --> 24:55.755
Uh, if you'll excuse me?

25:02.196 --> 25:05.373
Uh, am I glad to see you.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.375
Serena and I had to meet up with
our parents before we got here

25:07.462 --> 25:10.509
and it went from
"family ties" to Faulkner..

25:10.596 --> 25:13.773
...in one cocktail flat.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.383
Uh, hey, you excited
about your box?

25:15.470 --> 25:16.776
- My what?
- Oh, hey.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.865
We're on the third tier,
actually, yeah.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.736
'It's, um, a better view
and straight on.'

25:20.823 --> 25:22.738
Oh, Oh, yeah.
Well, third tier's awesome.

25:24.914 --> 25:27.003
- What's going on here?
- Nothing. Nothing's going on.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.965
Okay, so there might
be some other seats

25:32.052 --> 25:33.183
available to us.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.450
[camera shutter snapping]

25:42.802 --> 25:44.760
Lily.
Didn't know you'd be here.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.022
Who's your lucky escort
this evening?

25:46.109 --> 25:47.546
Someone you picked up
at the funeral?

25:47.633 --> 25:50.505
This is Rufus Humphrey,
the man I'm seeing.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.463
Mm. You remember Pauletta Cho?

25:52.551 --> 25:53.769
She's head of publicity
for my company.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.205
Ourcompany.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.294
Yes, hi, it's nice
to see you, Pauletta.

25:57.381 --> 26:00.820
But your choice of companion?
Not so nice.

26:00.907 --> 26:04.301
I'm here to keep an eye on him
more than anything else.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.694
Hope you both
enjoy the show.

26:05.781 --> 26:07.130
And if not,
you can ponder why

26:07.217 --> 26:09.089
you thought coming here together
was a good idea.

26:12.048 --> 26:15.182
Enjoy
"Tristan und isolde."

26:15.269 --> 26:16.575
[inhales deeply]

26:18.925 --> 26:21.101
Okay.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.190
- This isn't "The Magic Flute"?
- Oh, no.

26:23.277 --> 26:26.976
That opera ended weeks ago,
and it's mainly for kids.

26:27.063 --> 26:29.326
Ah, kids.
You gotta love 'em.

26:29.413 --> 26:32.721
They do such great things,
like misread the opera calendar.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.418
Bruce, hello.

26:34.505 --> 26:37.726
Hey, my condolences about Bart.
I-I haven't wanted to call.

26:37.813 --> 26:41.425
I-I didn't want to be a bother
in your-your time of grief.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.471
Uh, well, now that you're here,
what do you want me to do

26:43.558 --> 26:45.908
about those, uh, documents
I'd been working on?

26:50.217 --> 26:54.134
Um, could you wait here
for just a moment?

26:54.221 --> 26:56.136
What's going on?
I just need to talk to Charles.

26:56.223 --> 26:59.095
Um, you two can just
talk about opera while I'm gone.

27:02.055 --> 27:04.710
The answer is so simple.
How could I have forgotten it?

27:04.797 --> 27:06.581
Any chance you could
try and forget me?

27:06.668 --> 27:08.496
Just meet me back here
in 15 minutes.

27:08.583 --> 27:09.845
And if you don't like
what I suggest

27:09.932 --> 27:12.761
I won't bother you again,
you have my word.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.031
You don't have
any binoculars, do you?

27:25.644 --> 27:28.211
Oh, or how about those cool
little spy glasses?

27:28.298 --> 27:30.344
Or a telescope?

27:30.431 --> 27:32.476
Alright, I get it.
You wanna go to the stupid box.

27:32.563 --> 27:33.521
Not if you don't want to.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.914
Once the show starts

27:35.001 --> 27:36.132
I'm sure it'll be
great from up here.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.177
Yeah.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.618

28:10.950 --> 28:12.691
[sighs]

28:16.695 --> 28:17.608
You know, it's not that
you don't want to go

28:17.696 --> 28:19.175
to the same college as me.

28:19.262 --> 28:20.437
- It's not?
- No.

28:20.524 --> 28:21.787
A lot of couples
go to different schools.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.527
But, you know, for months

28:23.614 --> 28:26.182
you acted like going to Yale
together was what you wanted.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.576
Well, I didn't figure it
out until today.

28:30.534 --> 28:33.015
And Brown is
just a better fit for me, Dan.

28:35.061 --> 28:37.150
Well, and what about us?
I mean, do we still "fit"?

28:39.369 --> 28:41.807
Well, it's-it's not like
we have to decide anything now.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.025
- We can just--
- What?

28:43.112 --> 28:44.635
We can go on
having you make choices

28:44.723 --> 28:46.899
that affect both of our lives
without you talking to me?

28:51.947 --> 28:54.254
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.169
I was just..
I was so happy about Yale.

28:56.256 --> 28:57.779
If we went together,
you know

28:57.866 --> 28:59.999
we'd get four years away

29:00.086 --> 29:03.698
from-from everything
and from everyone.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.744
But it looks like our lives
aregonna follow us to college

29:05.831 --> 29:07.136
wherever we go.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.660
And what if
our parents stay together?

29:09.748 --> 29:12.533
What happens then?
More uncomfortable dinners?

29:12.620 --> 29:15.536
Adjoining rooms
on family vacations?

29:15.623 --> 29:17.712
Pretending not to hear
what we hear

29:17.799 --> 29:19.409
in the middle of the night?

29:19.496 --> 29:22.412
I mean, who knows how long
that's gonna last for?

29:22.499 --> 29:23.457

41:24.438 --> 41:25.787
What happened, Miss Blair?

41:25.874 --> 41:27.789
♪ ...High tide rattling off.. ♪

41:27.876 --> 41:29.965
It's what's going to happen that
you should be worried about.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.533
Not all beginnings
are cause for celebration.

41:32.620 --> 41:36.319
A lot of bad things begin,
fights, flu season

41:36.406 --> 41:37.799
and the worst thing of all..

41:37.886 --> 41:40.454
Uh-oh. Is it war?

41:40.541 --> 41:41.499
Yes.

41:42.891 --> 41:45.677
But this one
will be different.

41:45.764 --> 41:48.636
I need to wait for my moment,
and then I'm going Black Ops

41:48.723 --> 41:50.595
off the radar,
no accountability.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.598
This war, I'm gonna win.

41:53.685 --> 41:55.425
Wanna be starting somethin'.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.906
XOXO. Gossip Girl.
