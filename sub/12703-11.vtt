WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:03.394
In every generation
there is a chosen one.

00:03.438 --> 00:06.049
She alone will stand
against the vampires,

00:06.092 --> 00:08.833
the demons
and the forces of darkness.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.923
She is the slayer.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.446
[indistinct chatter]

00:12.490 --> 00:15.537
CORDELIA:
I just love springtime.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.364
Me in bright,
spring fashions.

00:17.408 --> 00:19.541
Spring training.

00:19.583 --> 00:20.803
Me at the end-of-school dance.

00:20.846 --> 00:22.021
The end of school.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.501
Definitely my favorite
time of year.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.807
[laughs]

00:25.850 --> 00:28.463
I am, of course, having
my dress specially made.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.856
Off-the-rack gives me hives.

00:30.899 --> 00:32.683
Let me guess.
Blue like your eyes.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.121
[both chuckle]

00:34.164 --> 00:36.514
My eyes are hazel,
Helen Keller.

00:36.557 --> 00:39.517
You two will look so fine
together in the May Queen photo.

00:39.561 --> 00:43.130
Well, I haven't
been elected May Queen yet.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.435
[Buffy grunting]

00:44.478 --> 00:46.045
[chuckles]

00:46.088 --> 00:48.134
[students clamoring]

00:48.177 --> 00:49.701
Behold the weirdness.

00:49.744 --> 00:51.137
You're probably wondering

00:51.180 --> 00:52.835
what I'm doing
with this stuff, huh?

00:52.878 --> 00:54.314
Wow!
I'm not.

00:54.357 --> 00:56.098
Uh, for history class.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.709
Mr. Giles has this,

00:57.753 --> 00:59.972
like, hobby
of collecting stuff,

01:00.015 --> 01:03.497
which he lent me
for show-and-tell.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.716
D-did I mention
it's for history class?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.415
She is always hanging
with that creepy librarian

01:07.457 --> 01:10.504
in that creepy library.

01:10.548 --> 01:11.722
Hey, did I ever
tell you about

01:11.766 --> 01:14.161
the time she attacked me
at the Bronze?

01:14.204 --> 01:16.685
I don't know why this school
admits mentals like her.

01:16.728 --> 01:19.426
[laughter]

01:19.469 --> 01:22.125
WOMAN:
"If you prick us,
do we not bleed?

01:22.168 --> 01:26.302
"If you tickle us,
do we not laugh?

01:26.347 --> 01:30.132
"If you poison us,
do we not die?

01:30.176 --> 01:34.658
And if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

01:36.139 --> 01:39.447
Okay.
So talk to me, people.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.014
How does what Shylock says here
about being a Jew relate

01:42.057 --> 01:45.930
to our discussion about the
anger of the outcast in society?

01:45.974 --> 01:47.454
Cordelia.

01:47.497 --> 01:50.109
Well, how about "color me
totally self-involved"?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.155
Care to elaborate?

01:52.198 --> 01:53.548
Yeah. With Shylock,

01:53.591 --> 01:55.027
it's whine, whine, whine,

01:55.070 --> 01:57.028
like the whole world
is about him.

01:57.073 --> 01:59.771
He acts like it's justice,
him getting a pound

01:59.814 --> 02:01.512
of Antonio's flesh.
It's not justice.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.992
It's yicky.
[chuckles]

02:04.036 --> 02:05.950
But has Shylock suffered?

02:05.995 --> 02:08.475
What's his place
in Venice society?

02:08.519 --> 02:10.042
Well, everyone
looked down on him.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.913
That is such a Twinkie defense.

02:11.956 --> 02:13.784
Shylock should get over himself.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.961
People who think
their problems

02:16.004 --> 02:18.399
are so huge craze me,
like this time

02:18.442 --> 02:20.401
I sort of ran over
this girl on her bike.

02:20.443 --> 02:22.751
It was the most traumatizing
event of mylife,

02:22.794 --> 02:24.969
and she's trying to
make it about herleg,

02:25.014 --> 02:27.234
like my pain meant nothing.

02:27.276 --> 02:29.888
Well, Cordelia's raised
an interesting point here.

02:29.931 --> 02:31.412
[bell rings]

02:31.454 --> 02:33.413
Which we'll pursue
at a later time.

02:33.456 --> 02:35.155
[indistinct chatter]

02:36.372 --> 02:39.158
Um... Ms. Miller?

02:39.201 --> 02:41.812
Good observations
today, Cordelia.

02:41.856 --> 02:42.944
It's always exciting
to know someone's

02:42.987 --> 02:44.033
actually done the reading.

02:44.075 --> 02:45.729
Thanks.
Um, I want to talk

02:45.774 --> 02:47.862
to you about my final paper.

02:47.906 --> 02:50.430
I'm real unfocused.
I have all these thoughts,

02:50.473 --> 02:53.302
and I'm pretty sure they
all contradict each other.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.262
Well, I have your outline here,

02:55.305 --> 02:57.219
but why don't you stop
by tomorrow after school?

02:57.264 --> 02:58.481
We'll go over it then.

02:58.526 --> 02:59.831
That'd be great.
Thanks a lot.

02:59.875 --> 03:00.831
You're welcome.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.181
I'll see you then.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.878
Okay, bye.

03:03.921 --> 03:05.445
Harmony, they calledHi!

03:05.489 --> 03:06.882
and said the dress is ready.

03:06.925 --> 03:09.145
It's so great!
Mitch is gonna die!

03:13.497 --> 03:15.890
[sniffles]

03:15.933 --> 03:17.979
[clears throat]

03:18.022 --> 03:20.722

[indistinct chatter]

03:27.859 --> 03:29.209
[locker opens]

03:34.170 --> 03:35.389
Hey, Mitch?

03:35.432 --> 03:36.737
You going to the Bronze?Later.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.652
I'm picking out my tux first.

03:38.695 --> 03:39.957
Got to look sharp
for the big dig.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.350
Oh, that's right.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.484
You got to look good
to be on Cordelia's arm.

03:43.526 --> 03:45.747
Oh, it's not her arm
I'm looking to be on.

03:45.789 --> 03:46.965
[laughs]

03:51.926 --> 03:54.276
[footsteps approaching]

03:56.974 --> 04:00.240
[girl giggling]

04:00.282 --> 04:02.764
Who's there?

04:08.812 --> 04:10.945
[girl giggling]

04:10.989 --> 04:13.600
Okay, fun time's over.
Come out.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.995
[grunting]

04:20.651 --> 04:23.872

04:27.483 --> 04:30.574
[wolf howling]

04:30.617 --> 04:32.706
â™ª

05:23.757 --> 05:26.891
Now, remember who to vote
for for May Queen, as in me.

05:26.935 --> 05:29.329
Thanks...

05:29.372 --> 05:31.591
Hi!
Isn't this the bomb?

05:31.634 --> 05:33.810
I'm such a campaign strategist.
[chuckles]

05:33.855 --> 05:35.072
"C."

05:35.117 --> 05:37.074
For Cordelia?

05:37.119 --> 05:39.033
No, C for Wilma, little brain.

05:39.076 --> 05:40.774
Of course C for Cordelia.

05:40.817 --> 05:43.168
This way, people will associate
me with something sweet.

05:43.211 --> 05:45.954
[indistinct chatter]

05:45.997 --> 05:47.389
Here's a chocolate--

05:47.433 --> 05:49.130
Oh, I don't think I need

05:49.173 --> 05:50.524
the loony fringe vote.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.439
[indistinct chatter]

05:53.483 --> 05:56.704
Well, I don't even
like chocolates.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.749
Okay, that was
the lamest comeback

05:58.793 --> 06:00.098
of our times.

06:00.141 --> 06:01.665
So what's Cordelia up to?

06:01.709 --> 06:04.319
Bribery-- she's desperate
to be May Queen.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.408
Cordelia, man,
she does love titles.

06:06.452 --> 06:08.105
[laughing]:
Oh, God!

06:08.149 --> 06:10.108
Remember in sixth grade
with the field trip?

06:10.151 --> 06:11.413
XANDER:
Right! Right!

06:11.458 --> 06:14.156
The guy with the antlers
on his belt.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.636
[laughing]:
"Be my deputy."

06:15.678 --> 06:18.247
And remember the-the hat?Oh, God, the hat!

06:18.290 --> 06:20.728
Gee, it's fun that
we're speaking in tongues.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.425
[laughing]

06:22.468 --> 06:24.427
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.211
XANDER: It was just,
we had this, uh--

06:26.254 --> 06:28.257
You had to be there, really.It's not even funny.

06:29.170 --> 06:30.346
Oh, Cordelia just has

06:30.389 --> 06:32.478
a history of
trying too hard.

06:32.521 --> 06:34.175
Yeah, what kind of moron

06:34.218 --> 06:35.742
would want to be
May Queen anyway?

06:35.786 --> 06:37.353
I was.

06:37.396 --> 06:39.223
You what?

06:39.268 --> 06:41.617
At my old school.

06:41.661 --> 06:44.447
Oh, so the, uh, good kind
of moron would do that,

06:44.490 --> 06:46.057
the, uh, non-moron,

06:46.100 --> 06:47.449
I mean.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.973
Well, we didn't
call it May Queen,

06:50.018 --> 06:51.627
but we had the coronation

06:51.672 --> 06:53.500
and the dance
and all that stuff.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.415
It was nice.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.154
Well, you know, you don't
need that anymore; you got us.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.418
[laughing]

06:59.461 --> 07:01.855
"Be my deputy."

07:02.725 --> 07:04.685
[laughter]

07:04.728 --> 07:06.730
Guys, come on!

07:06.774 --> 07:08.209
Mitch got wailed on.
I think he's--

07:08.252 --> 07:09.994
Dead?
Of course not.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.995
Dead-- what are you, ghouls?

07:12.040 --> 07:14.389
There are no dead students here.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.435
This week.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.220
Clear back, make room,
all of you!

07:18.262 --> 07:19.569
Mitch, what happened?

07:19.612 --> 07:21.223
MITCH:
I don't know.

07:21.266 --> 07:23.399
I-I heard something.

07:23.442 --> 07:26.750
I tried to grab a-a bat...

07:26.793 --> 07:28.795
[laughs]
...that hit me.

07:28.838 --> 07:30.100
What hit you?

07:30.144 --> 07:31.928
The bat, by itself.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.932
The thing was floating,
and it knocked me out.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.283
I better check out the scene.

07:38.326 --> 07:41.112
Where do you think
you're going?

07:41.156 --> 07:43.985
Um, Mitch wanted me
to get his comb.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.899
He-he likes his comb.

07:45.942 --> 07:48.511
I don't think Mitch
needs his comb right now.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.557
I think Mitch needs
medical attention.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.689
And you need
to stay away

07:52.733 --> 07:54.081
from the crime scene.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.649
Always sticking your nose in.

07:55.692 --> 07:56.779
WILLOW:
"Sue"?

07:56.824 --> 07:57.954
What did you say?

07:57.999 --> 08:00.480
Mitch was gonna sue
the school?

08:00.523 --> 08:03.264
Sue?
Who?

08:03.307 --> 08:05.266
[mouths]:
Thank you.

08:05.310 --> 08:06.877
XANDER:
Well, his dad is

08:06.920 --> 08:09.096
is the most powerful lawyer
in Sunnydale.

08:09.139 --> 08:11.447
Hold on,
what have you two heard?

08:11.490 --> 08:13.274
His dad, the lawyer--
you haven't heard of him?

08:13.317 --> 08:16.408
Other lawyers
call him "The Beast."

08:34.514 --> 08:38.081
â™ª

08:56.230 --> 08:57.537
WILLOW:
"Look"?

08:57.580 --> 08:59.147
That's all it said?

08:59.190 --> 09:01.192
Look at what?
Look at Mitch?

09:01.235 --> 09:03.759
Maybe. All I know
is it's a message.

09:03.803 --> 09:05.109
And?

09:05.153 --> 09:06.894
Oh, here you are.

09:06.937 --> 09:08.895
And monsters don't
usually send messages.

09:08.938 --> 09:10.811
It's pretty much
crush, kill, destroy.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.289
This was different.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.726
I'd have to say
you're right.

09:13.769 --> 09:16.163
I love it when he says that.
Any theories?

09:16.206 --> 09:18.253
I mean, uh, it's a bit
of a puzzle, really.

09:18.296 --> 09:20.908
Um, I've never actually
heard of anyone

09:20.951 --> 09:23.083
attacked by a lone
baseball bat before.

09:23.126 --> 09:25.869
Maybe it's a vampire bat.

09:25.913 --> 09:28.088
I'm alone with that one, huh?

09:28.131 --> 09:30.613
Well, assuming the bat
itself is not possessed,

09:30.657 --> 09:33.572
there are a few possibilities
that bear investigating.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.836
Uh, someone with telekinesis--

09:35.879 --> 09:38.316
um, the power to move
objects at will.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.361
Uh, an invisible creature.

09:40.404 --> 09:42.232
And possibly,

09:42.277 --> 09:43.625
a poltergeist.

09:43.669 --> 09:45.235
A ghost?

09:45.279 --> 09:46.542
Yes, and a very angry one.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.109
Yeah, I'd say.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.980
The locker room
was a real scene.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.028
If it's a ghost, then we're
talking about a dead kid.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.506
I guess so.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.943
You know, why don't
you compile a list

09:56.986 --> 09:58.206
of dead
or missing kids?

09:58.249 --> 09:59.816
It's probably
a good place to start.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.644
And, uh, I'll research
all the possibilities,

10:01.687 --> 10:03.558
ghosts included--
uh, Xander?

10:03.602 --> 10:06.475
If you're not doing anything,
would you like to help me?

10:06.518 --> 10:08.912
What, so there's homework now?

10:08.956 --> 10:10.913
When did that happen?

10:10.957 --> 10:12.828
It's all part of the glamorous
world of vampire-slayage.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.438
Well,
what part do you have?

10:14.482 --> 10:16.398
I'm gonna find out
what I can about Mitch.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.878
This attack wasn't random.

10:17.921 --> 10:19.400
Well, I want that part.

10:19.443 --> 10:20.836
Fine, you can do it.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.751
Ask around.
Talk to his friends.

10:22.796 --> 10:24.100
Talk to Cordelia.

10:24.144 --> 10:27.451
"Talk to Cordelia"?

10:27.495 --> 10:29.932
So, research, huh?
[chuckles]

10:29.976 --> 10:32.022
Hi!Uh, hi.

10:32.066 --> 10:34.197
Cordelia, you weren't
in fifth period.

10:34.241 --> 10:36.200
I went to the hospital.

10:36.244 --> 10:37.636
Oh, Mitch.
How is he?

10:37.679 --> 10:38.985
Will he be okay?

10:39.028 --> 10:40.900
Well, the doctor
says he'll be fine.

10:40.943 --> 10:42.684
They're gonna
send him home tomorrow,

10:42.729 --> 10:45.034
but you should have seen him

10:45.078 --> 10:48.342
lying there,
all black and blue.

10:48.385 --> 10:50.823
How's he gonna look
in our prom pictures?

10:50.866 --> 10:53.043
How am I ever gonna be able
to show them to anyone?

10:53.086 --> 10:54.697
Well, they can do
wonderful things

10:54.740 --> 10:56.698
with air brushes these days.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.658
You think?

10:58.701 --> 11:00.049
Hi!

11:00.094 --> 11:02.399
Hi.
Did you see Mitch?

11:02.443 --> 11:04.359
He just broke up with
Wendy eight seconds ago,

11:04.402 --> 11:06.056
and he's already
nosing around.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.710
It's shameless.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.017
In the spring, ifhe
makes varsity baseball,

11:10.059 --> 11:12.583
maybe I'll take him
on a test drive.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.933
GIRL:
Hi, guys!

11:13.976 --> 11:15.717
What do you want?

11:15.761 --> 11:19.721
I just hope they can prop him up
long enough to take the picture.

11:19.765 --> 11:21.331
Cordelia, can I talk to you?

11:21.375 --> 11:23.421
Oh, great.

11:23.465 --> 11:24.813
Why is she always try--?

11:24.857 --> 11:27.817
[grunting]

11:27.860 --> 11:30.732
[students clamoring]

11:30.777 --> 11:33.475
Harmony!

11:33.518 --> 11:34.693
[girl gasps]

11:34.736 --> 11:36.129
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.870
Clear back, everyone.

11:37.913 --> 11:39.001
Give her some air!

11:39.046 --> 11:40.437
BOY:
Someone call 911...

11:40.481 --> 11:41.788
You!

11:41.831 --> 11:43.702
School nurse, now.

11:45.052 --> 11:47.009
[moans]
Oh, my ankle.

11:47.053 --> 11:48.794
I think it's broken.

11:48.837 --> 11:50.057
What happened?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.144
Hey, who's the principal here?

11:51.187 --> 11:52.275
What happened?

11:52.320 --> 11:53.974
She fell!
She, she--

11:54.017 --> 11:55.452
We were standing
at the top of the stairs,

11:55.496 --> 11:57.890
and she just fell
all by herself.

11:57.933 --> 11:59.543
HARMONY:
No! I was pushed!

11:59.587 --> 12:01.721
[girl laughing]

12:02.895 --> 12:05.115
Ow!Don't sue.

12:08.205 --> 12:11.294
[girl laughing]

12:19.650 --> 12:21.174
Is anybody here?

12:21.217 --> 12:23.220
[door closes]

12:24.655 --> 12:27.049
[thud][footsteps]

12:27.094 --> 12:30.270
Hey, who's here?

12:42.761 --> 12:44.110
[thumping]

12:44.153 --> 12:45.415
Okay,

12:45.460 --> 12:47.548
I know someone's here.

12:49.942 --> 12:52.727
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to talk to you.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.047
[thumping from above]

13:10.441 --> 13:13.966
[bell ringing]

13:14.009 --> 13:16.751
[indistinct chatter]

13:16.796 --> 13:18.187
Hey, guys?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.798
Hey!

13:19.841 --> 13:21.322
BUFFY:
Giles, have you ever
touched a ghost?

13:21.365 --> 13:22.802
GILES:
Uh, no.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.673
From what I've heard,
uh, having a-a ghost

13:24.716 --> 13:26.806
pass through you is
a singular experience.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.764
It's a, it's a rather, uh, cold,
amorphous feeling

13:29.808 --> 13:31.767
that makes your hair
stand on end.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.769
You see, that's my problem.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.989
I touched the thing,
but it didn't go through me.

13:36.032 --> 13:38.817
It bumped into me.
And it wasn't cold.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.557
So we're talking about
what, an invisible person?

13:40.601 --> 13:42.255
BUFFY:
A girl.
She laughed.

13:42.298 --> 13:44.692
A girl on campus with the
ability to become invisible.

13:44.735 --> 13:47.739
That is so cool!

13:47.783 --> 13:48.827
"Cool"?Well, yeah,
I would give anything

13:48.870 --> 13:50.046
to be able to turn invisible.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.394
Well, I wouldn't use

13:51.438 --> 13:53.135
my powers to beat people up.

13:53.179 --> 13:55.442
I'd use my powers to protect
the girls' locker room.

13:55.485 --> 13:58.272
It must be a fairly
heady experience.

13:58.315 --> 14:01.144
Having that ability.

14:01.187 --> 14:03.102
How'd she get it?
Is she a witch?

14:03.145 --> 14:05.322
'Cause we can fight a witch.

14:05.365 --> 14:08.063
Mm, Greek myths speak
of cloaks of invisibility,

14:08.107 --> 14:10.240
but they're usually
for the gods.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.414
[laughs]

14:11.458 --> 14:12.938
Research boy comes through

14:12.981 --> 14:14.854
with the knowledge.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.855
This girl's sort
of petty for a god.

14:16.899 --> 14:20.772
She's got a grudge,
but why Harmony?

14:20.816 --> 14:22.557
Harmony and Mitch-- their
common denominator is...

14:22.600 --> 14:24.341
Cordelia.

14:24.384 --> 14:26.255
So what now?

14:26.299 --> 14:27.953
First thing tomorrow,
why don't you pull up

14:27.996 --> 14:29.129
that missing kids list?

14:29.172 --> 14:31.696
Got it.
I'll see you then.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.307
Bye.See ya.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.698
XANDER:
Oh, hey, do you want

14:34.743 --> 14:36.527
to come to our place
tonight for dinner?

14:36.571 --> 14:38.528
Mom's making her famous phone
call to the Chinese place.

14:38.572 --> 14:41.532
Xander, do you guys
even have a stove?

14:41.576 --> 14:43.926
So, I'll look into ways
that you can de-cloak

14:43.970 --> 14:45.927
a-an invisible someone.

14:45.971 --> 14:47.668
What about you?

14:47.711 --> 14:49.192
I think Cordelia's
gonna be working

14:49.235 --> 14:50.672
on her May Queen dress
tonight.

14:50.715 --> 14:52.107
Maybe there'll be
some action.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.110
I guess I'm gonna
start the hunt.

14:54.153 --> 14:57.548
How exactly do you propose
to hunt someone you can't see?

14:59.419 --> 15:01.552
GILES:
You may have to work
on listening to people.

15:01.596 --> 15:02.813
BUFFY:
Very funny.

15:02.857 --> 15:05.164
GILES:
I thought so.

15:06.687 --> 15:09.038
[girls laughing,
chatting indistinctly]

15:15.217 --> 15:16.437
Should I wear my hair up?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.787
Do you think
I should wear it up?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.962
[laughter]

15:21.006 --> 15:22.616
Wait, how does
the, um, hem go?

15:22.659 --> 15:25.793
Is it, is it long enough or...?

15:33.235 --> 15:35.107
Isn't it beautiful?

15:35.150 --> 15:37.849
Ooh!

15:37.893 --> 15:41.461
[flute playing]

16:00.350 --> 16:02.525
[creaking]

16:04.005 --> 16:05.965
Who's there?

16:14.364 --> 16:16.975
Oh!

16:19.456 --> 16:21.327
[chuckles]

16:21.370 --> 16:23.198
A vampire casts

16:23.243 --> 16:24.984
no reflection.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.462
Don't worry.

16:26.506 --> 16:28.465
I'm not here to eat.

16:28.509 --> 16:31.554
Buffy told me you don't feed
from humans anymore.

16:31.599 --> 16:33.121
Not for a long while.

16:33.165 --> 16:35.428
Is that why you're here,
to see her?

16:35.471 --> 16:37.431
I can't.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.128
It's, uh...

16:39.172 --> 16:42.783
it's too hard for me
to be around her.

16:42.826 --> 16:45.874
A vampire in love
with a slayer.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.049
It's rather poetic...

16:48.094 --> 16:50.096
in a maudlin sort of way.

16:52.880 --> 16:53.881
What can I, uh--

16:53.924 --> 16:56.363
what can I do for you?

16:56.405 --> 16:59.756
I know you've been
researching the master.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.195
Yes, the vampire king.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.980
I'm trying to learn as much
as I can about him for the day

17:05.022 --> 17:06.547
that Buffy
must face him.

17:06.589 --> 17:08.853
Something's already in motion,
something big,

17:08.896 --> 17:12.117
but I don't know what.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.903
You've read all the slayer lore
there is, right?

17:14.944 --> 17:19.255
I've studied all
the extant volumes, of course.

17:19.298 --> 17:22.040
But the, uh,
most salient books

17:22.084 --> 17:24.913
of slayer prophecy
have been lost--

17:24.954 --> 17:28.568
The Tiberius Manifesto,
The Pergamum Codex.

17:28.612 --> 17:29.961
The Codex?

17:30.005 --> 17:31.354
It's reputed to have contained

17:31.397 --> 17:32.834
the most complete prophecies

17:32.876 --> 17:35.357
about the slayer's role
in the end years.

17:35.402 --> 17:38.926
Unfortunately, the book was lost
in the 15th century.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.320
Not lost.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.278
Misplaced.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.238
I can get it.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.935
[gasps]

17:47.979 --> 17:50.765
That would be most helpful.

17:52.332 --> 17:55.161
Uh, my-my own volumes have,

17:55.203 --> 17:57.076
have been rather
useless of late.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.947
Legends of Vishnu?

17:58.990 --> 18:00.557
[chuckles]

18:00.601 --> 18:03.125
There's an invisible girl

18:03.169 --> 18:05.648
terrorizing the school.

18:05.692 --> 18:08.217
That's not really
my area of expertise.

18:08.260 --> 18:10.045
Nor mine, I'm afraid.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.526
It's fascinating, though.

18:12.568 --> 18:14.528
By all accounts, it's a-a,

18:14.570 --> 18:17.922
a wonderful power to possess.

18:17.965 --> 18:21.143
Oh, I don't know.

18:21.186 --> 18:23.537
Looking in the mirror every day

18:23.579 --> 18:25.407
and seeing nothing there?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.672
It's an overrated
pleasure.

18:30.369 --> 18:32.807
â™ª

18:34.503 --> 18:36.680
CORDELIA:
God, I am never
sitting through

18:36.723 --> 18:39.117
one of those alumni
lectures again!

18:39.161 --> 18:40.205
Two hours

18:40.249 --> 18:42.511
of "My trek through Nepal."

18:42.556 --> 18:44.557
Hello?
There is nobody caring.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.343
And did you guys see his toupee?
I mean, it looks like a cabbage.

18:47.386 --> 18:49.084
And those slides?

18:49.127 --> 18:50.825
"That's a mountain.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.132
That's a mountain, too.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.002
Now look at
some mountains."

18:55.046 --> 18:56.613
I swear he had three slides,

18:56.656 --> 18:59.573
and just used them
over and over.

18:59.615 --> 19:01.269
I know, but did you
see his toupee?

19:01.314 --> 19:03.271
I mean, it was,
like, the worst.

19:03.316 --> 19:05.578
We're talking, okay?

19:05.622 --> 19:08.407
Oh, and did you guys check out
that extreme toupee?

19:08.451 --> 19:10.365
Yeah, that's realistic.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.063
It looked like a cabbage.

19:12.106 --> 19:14.587
[laughter]

19:14.631 --> 19:17.025
That's so funny.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.157
[laughter]

19:23.944 --> 19:27.904
PRINCIPAL SNYDER:
The winner is Cordelia Chase.

19:27.949 --> 19:30.038
Let's bring up
our new May Queen!

19:30.080 --> 19:31.865
There you are.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.041
Thank you for making
the right choice

19:34.085 --> 19:36.784
and for showing me
how much you all love me.

19:36.826 --> 19:39.177
[applause]

19:39.221 --> 19:42.355
Being this popular
is not just my right,

19:42.397 --> 19:43.964
but my responsibility.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.227
And I want you to know

19:45.270 --> 19:47.359
I take it very seriously.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.535
It all began about...

19:48.577 --> 19:49.839
So Giles said you'd be here.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.190
Why are you being here?

19:51.232 --> 19:52.756
Last night was a bust,

19:52.799 --> 19:54.758
but I still think
Cordy's the key here.

19:54.801 --> 19:57.673
This is the dead
and missing list.

19:57.718 --> 20:00.111
I pulled up their classes,
activities, medical records.

20:00.154 --> 20:02.505
Good work.

20:04.855 --> 20:07.030
WILLOW:
Has Cordelia hired

20:07.075 --> 20:09.208
hired a bodyguard
or something?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.165
[insdistinct chatter]

20:11.210 --> 20:12.906
Hey, you guys,
check out this one.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.996
It's the most recent one--
Marcie Ross

20:15.038 --> 20:16.432
disappeared, like,
six months ago.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.867
I don't know her.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.566
Me, neither.

20:19.608 --> 20:21.567
Her only activity was band.

20:21.611 --> 20:24.266
She played the flute.So?

20:24.309 --> 20:26.094
Well, last night when I was
hunting, I heard this flute,

20:26.136 --> 20:27.922
but I couldn't figure out
where it was coming from.

20:27.964 --> 20:30.837
And it was in the band room that
I lost Miss Invisible yesterday.

20:30.881 --> 20:33.275
You know what, this all tracks.
I'm gonna check it out.

20:33.318 --> 20:34.624
See you guys later?

20:34.667 --> 20:36.104
Okay, we'll see you
after geometry.

20:36.146 --> 20:37.800
CORDELIA: ...ask, "Hey,
what am I wearing

20:37.845 --> 20:39.280
to that spring fling?"

21:06.265 --> 21:08.657
â™ª

21:36.685 --> 21:40.298
â™ª

21:53.528 --> 21:55.965
[heavy breathing]

22:26.432 --> 22:28.738
"Marcie Ross."

22:28.781 --> 22:30.435
So it is you.

22:37.094 --> 22:39.096
[heavy breathing]

23:06.210 --> 23:07.777
[door closes]

23:07.820 --> 23:09.778
Cordelia, could you possibly
be on ti--?

23:09.823 --> 23:12.259
[footsteps]

23:17.569 --> 23:19.309
[Marcie laughing]

23:19.354 --> 23:21.703
Who's there?

23:24.663 --> 23:26.665
[gasping]

23:34.151 --> 23:36.936
Ms. Miller?

23:36.980 --> 23:38.765
Oh, my God!

23:38.807 --> 23:40.461
Ms. Miller!

23:40.506 --> 23:41.984
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

23:42.028 --> 23:43.551
[gasps, coughs]

23:43.596 --> 23:46.424
Ms. Miller-- aah!
What happened?

23:46.468 --> 23:48.164
MILLER:
Attacked.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.471
Didn't see.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.646
[gasps]

23:51.691 --> 23:53.561
[chalk scraping]

24:00.613 --> 24:02.483
A nest?

24:02.528 --> 24:03.484
Looked like

24:03.528 --> 24:05.269
she'd been there for months.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.357
It's where I found this.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.403
Check it out.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.057
Oh, my God.

24:12.493 --> 24:16.411
"Have a nice summer.
Have a nice summer."

24:16.454 --> 24:19.458
This girl had no friends at all.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.502
Uh, once again, I teeter

24:21.547 --> 24:24.375
at the precipice
of the generation gap.

24:24.419 --> 24:25.898
"Have a nice summer"
is what you write

24:25.942 --> 24:27.727
when you have nothing to say.

24:27.769 --> 24:29.380
It's the kiss of death.

24:29.423 --> 24:31.817
You guys didn't know
Marcie Ross?

24:31.861 --> 24:34.472
Never met her.
Why?

24:34.516 --> 24:37.476
Cause you both
wrote it, too.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.566
"Have a nice--"
Yeesh!

24:40.608 --> 24:43.220
Where am I?

24:43.263 --> 24:44.526
Oh.

24:44.569 --> 24:45.788
"Have a greatsummer."

24:45.832 --> 24:47.310
See? I cared.

24:47.355 --> 24:48.703
You guys don't remember her?

24:48.748 --> 24:50.357
No. I probably didn't see her,

24:50.401 --> 24:51.663
except to sign the book.

24:51.707 --> 24:54.013
I mean, this is a big school.

24:54.057 --> 24:55.667
Xander, we each had
four classes

24:55.711 --> 24:58.018
with her last year.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.759
So no one noticed her,
and now she's invisible.

25:00.803 --> 25:03.588
What? She turned invisible,
because no one noticed her?

25:03.632 --> 25:06.592
Of course!

25:09.550 --> 25:11.335
I've been investigating
the mystical

25:11.378 --> 25:13.032
causes of invisibility,

25:13.076 --> 25:15.513
when I-I should have looked
at the quantum mechanical.

25:15.557 --> 25:17.558
Physics.

25:17.603 --> 25:21.911
I think I speak for everyone
here when I say, "Huh?"

25:21.954 --> 25:25.740
It's a rudimentary concept

25:25.785 --> 25:27.742
that-that reality is shaped,

25:27.787 --> 25:29.832
even-even created...

25:29.875 --> 25:32.095
by our perception.

25:32.138 --> 25:34.357
And with the hellmouth below us
sending out mystical energy...

25:34.402 --> 25:36.796
People perceived Marcie
as-as invisible,

25:36.838 --> 25:39.625
and-and-and she became so.

25:39.667 --> 25:42.452
So, who knows
the answer to this one?

25:42.497 --> 25:44.280
Think about it.

25:44.325 --> 25:45.760
Cordelia.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.414
Well, just because
the story's about him

25:47.458 --> 25:49.590
doesn't necessarily mean
he's the hero, right?

25:49.634 --> 25:52.115
Exactly.
So what do we call him?

25:52.159 --> 25:53.421
[students clamor]

25:53.463 --> 25:54.596
Willow?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.076
Well, the protagonist.

25:56.118 --> 25:57.643
Xander?

25:57.685 --> 25:59.296
Why can't he be both?

25:59.339 --> 26:01.037
I mean, he did do some things
that were pretty heroic.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.561
Absolutely.
Who doesn't agree with that?

26:07.086 --> 26:10.263
Okay...

26:10.307 --> 26:12.179
And how about...?

26:15.835 --> 26:18.489
â™ª

26:22.971 --> 26:24.886
â™ª

26:30.632 --> 26:33.416
This isn't this great power
that she can control.

26:33.461 --> 26:36.376
But something
that was done to her.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.901
That wedid to her.

26:38.944 --> 26:40.859
No wonder she's miffed.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.602
What does she want?

26:43.644 --> 26:46.430
Just what we thought.

26:46.473 --> 26:48.214
Cordelia.
CORDELIA:
What?

26:50.739 --> 26:51.697
I knew you'd be here.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.394
Buffy?

26:53.436 --> 26:55.439
I, uh, I, I know we've had
our differences,

26:55.482 --> 26:57.397
with you being
so weird and all

26:57.441 --> 26:59.400
and hanging out
with these

26:59.442 --> 27:00.401
total losers.

27:00.443 --> 27:01.707
Ooh.

27:01.750 --> 27:02.882
Well, anyway,

27:02.924 --> 27:04.361
despite all of that,

27:04.404 --> 27:06.276
I know that you share
this feeling

27:06.319 --> 27:08.757
that we have
for each other, deep down.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.019
Nausea?

27:10.063 --> 27:11.586
Somebody is after me!

27:11.630 --> 27:14.327
They just tried
to kill Mrs. Miller!

27:14.371 --> 27:16.155
She was helping me
with my homework!

27:16.199 --> 27:18.680
And Mitch and Harmony?

27:18.723 --> 27:22.249
This is all about me--
me, me, me!

27:22.291 --> 27:24.381
Wow, for once she's right.

27:24.424 --> 27:27.297
So you've come to me for help.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.082
Because...

27:29.125 --> 27:30.518
you're always around

27:30.560 --> 27:32.172
when all this weird stuff
is happening.

27:32.214 --> 27:34.347
And I know
you're very strong,

27:34.391 --> 27:36.698
and you've got
all those weapons.

27:36.741 --> 27:38.526
I was kind of hoping
you were in a gang.

27:38.568 --> 27:40.659
Please!

27:40.701 --> 27:41.702
I don't have

27:41.747 --> 27:44.009
anyone else to turn to.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.797
[clears his throat]

27:48.840 --> 27:50.756
Please.

27:50.798 --> 27:52.322
Sit down.

27:52.365 --> 27:54.715
Okay, thanks.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.415
You know, I--

27:59.460 --> 28:02.244
I don't recall ever
seeing you here before.

28:02.288 --> 28:04.203
Oh, no.
I have a life.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.336
[clears her throat]
Okay.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.816
[sighs]

28:07.859 --> 28:10.776
Cordelia, your attacker
is an invisible girl.

28:10.818 --> 28:12.733
Who is really,
really angry at you,

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
which I can't imagine
personally,

28:14.779 --> 28:16.259
but it takes
all kinds, you know?

28:16.303 --> 28:17.869
Well, I don't care

28:17.913 --> 28:21.221
what it is--
just get rid of it.

28:21.263 --> 28:22.526
Well, it's not that simple.

28:22.569 --> 28:24.833
It's a person.
It's...

28:24.876 --> 28:26.704
it's this person.

28:26.748 --> 28:29.445
Now, do you have
any idea why she'd be so--?

28:29.490 --> 28:32.144
Oh, God, is she really
wearing Laura Ashley?

28:32.188 --> 28:34.016
So homicidal?

28:34.059 --> 28:35.670
[scoffs]
I have no idea.

28:35.713 --> 28:37.759
I've never seen this girl
before in my life.

28:37.802 --> 28:40.806
MARCIE [muttering]:
Well, I guess you
didn't see me coming.

28:40.848 --> 28:44.069
Cordelia, you don't remember me,
but I remember you.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.028
All your slut friends--
I hate them!

28:46.072 --> 28:48.682
They take your life
and they suck it out of you...

28:48.727 --> 28:50.076
And they didn't see me coming!

28:50.118 --> 28:51.642
Now, they got
to learn.

28:51.685 --> 28:53.426
They got to learn.

28:53.470 --> 28:56.169
According to what you told us
about the attack on Ms. Miller,

28:56.211 --> 28:58.953
we now have two messages
from Marcie--

28:58.998 --> 29:01.304
"look and listen."

29:01.347 --> 29:04.046
Messages we don't
understand.

29:04.089 --> 29:06.744
I don't think we're
supposed to... yet.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.659
Marcie's not quite ready.

29:08.702 --> 29:10.617
But from what she did
to Cordelia's picture,

29:10.661 --> 29:12.707
I would say that she's wigged
on the whole May Queen thing.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.664
Maybe she's gonna do
something about it.

29:14.709 --> 29:16.450
Stop the coronation tonight,

29:16.492 --> 29:18.059
maybe.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.758
Keep you guys
away from the Bronze?

29:19.800 --> 29:22.717
Nothing is keeping me
from the Bronze tonight.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.720
Can we just revel in your
fabulous lack of priorities?

29:25.763 --> 29:27.155
CORDELIA: If I'm not
crowned tonight,

29:27.200 --> 29:29.157
then... then Marcie's won,

29:29.201 --> 29:30.637
and that would be bad!

29:30.681 --> 29:32.422
She's evil, okay?

29:32.465 --> 29:34.076
Way eviler than me.

29:34.119 --> 29:36.383
Cordelia has a point.

29:36.425 --> 29:38.079
Buffy's with me on this.

29:38.124 --> 29:41.257
Anyway, continuing the normal
May Queen activities

29:41.300 --> 29:43.564
may be the best way
to draw Marcie out.

29:43.606 --> 29:45.958
We can use Cordelia as bait.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.134
Great!
Bait?

29:48.176 --> 29:50.962
Willow, Xander, you'll help me
begin our research anew.

29:51.006 --> 29:54.009
Unless we find a way to cure
Marcie's invisibility,

29:54.052 --> 29:55.054
then Buffy will be--

29:55.096 --> 29:57.796
A sitting duck.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.579
Come on.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.625
Well, I have to try on my dress.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.365
And am I really bait?

30:03.410 --> 30:06.281
[Marcie breathing]

30:06.326 --> 30:08.545
So, how much
the creepy is it

30:08.588 --> 30:10.460
that this Marcie's
been at this for months?

30:10.503 --> 30:12.461
Spying on us.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.248
Learning our most
guarded secrets.

30:15.290 --> 30:17.510
So are you saying
she's invisible

30:17.554 --> 30:19.556
because she's
so unpopular?

30:19.599 --> 30:21.253
That about sums it up.

30:21.297 --> 30:23.996
Bummer for her.

30:24.038 --> 30:26.563
It's awful to feel
that lonely.

30:26.606 --> 30:28.000
Hmm, so you've read something
about the feeling?

30:28.042 --> 30:29.044
Hey.

30:29.087 --> 30:30.393
You think I'm never lonely

30:30.436 --> 30:32.874
because I'm so cute
and popular?

30:32.917 --> 30:34.483
I can be surrounded by people

30:34.528 --> 30:37.661
and be completely alone.

30:37.704 --> 30:39.924
It's not like any of them
really know me.

30:39.968 --> 30:44.232
I don't even know if they
like me half the time.

30:44.277 --> 30:48.106
People just want to be
in the popular zone.

30:48.150 --> 30:50.805
Sometimes when I talk,

30:50.848 --> 30:54.590
everyone's so busy
agreeing with me,

30:54.634 --> 30:56.201
they don't hear a word I say.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.509
Well, if you feel so alone,

30:59.552 --> 31:01.510
then why do you work
so hard at being popular?

31:01.555 --> 31:05.166
Well, it beats being
alone all by yourself.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.742
[flute playing][Willow shushes]

31:15.786 --> 31:18.223
Listen.

31:22.705 --> 31:24.751
Come on.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.407
[flute gets louder]

31:31.279 --> 31:33.281
We could talk to her.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.501
Perhaps reason with her.

31:36.938 --> 31:39.419
Or possibly grab her.

31:39.461 --> 31:40.986
There are
three of us.

31:41.028 --> 31:43.030
Let's go.

31:47.905 --> 31:50.996
If you ever tell anyone that I
changed in a mop closet...

31:51.038 --> 31:52.998
Your secret
dies with me.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.346
[sighs]

31:54.390 --> 31:56.261
Looks okay,
but hurry.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.307
Okay.

32:02.571 --> 32:04.923
[flute playing]

32:18.240 --> 32:20.241
Over here.

32:21.765 --> 32:24.507
[flute gets louder]

32:29.598 --> 32:31.210
Marcie?

32:31.252 --> 32:32.732
We know what
happened to you.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.604
Please,
can we talk to you?

32:34.647 --> 32:38.346
We're sorry we ignored you.

32:45.267 --> 32:48.096
Can you say... gulp?

32:48.140 --> 32:50.445
[door slams]

32:53.275 --> 32:55.711
[pounding on door]

32:55.756 --> 32:56.799
What's that sound?

32:56.844 --> 32:58.888
[hissing]

32:58.932 --> 33:01.240
You know what you
were saying before?

33:01.282 --> 33:03.676
I understand.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.417
Somehow it doesn't
seem to matter

33:05.461 --> 33:06.722
how popular you are when--

33:06.767 --> 33:07.986
CORDELIA:
You were popular?

33:08.028 --> 33:10.901
In what alternate
universe?

33:10.944 --> 33:13.382
In L.A.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.428
The point is...

33:15.471 --> 33:17.907
I did sort of feel
like something was missing.

33:17.951 --> 33:21.303
Is that when you became
weird and got kicked out?

33:21.346 --> 33:24.045
Okay, can we have
the heartfelt talk

33:24.088 --> 33:26.134
with a little less
talk from you?

33:28.309 --> 33:30.008
Cordelia?

33:30.050 --> 33:31.835
[thumping,
muffled cries]

33:31.878 --> 33:33.445
Cordelia?

33:33.489 --> 33:34.969
[door handle rattling]

33:35.012 --> 33:37.015
Cordelia!

33:41.801 --> 33:43.281
Buffy!

33:50.244 --> 33:53.117
It's gas.

33:53.161 --> 33:55.032
She's snuffed out
the pilot light.

33:55.076 --> 33:58.471
The gas is up full.

34:00.429 --> 34:01.951
I can't find the shutoff valve.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.040
[coughing]

34:03.084 --> 34:04.390
Is this it?

34:04.432 --> 34:05.478
Okay, that's bad.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.045
How about the door?

34:13.224 --> 34:15.052
No!

34:15.096 --> 34:17.619
One spark, and you'll take
the whole building with us.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.023
Cordelia!
Cordelia!

34:31.025 --> 34:32.373
Oh, my God.

34:33.418 --> 34:35.202
[punch lands]Ooh!

34:35.246 --> 34:38.076
[grunting]

34:42.556 --> 34:45.083
[footsteps]

34:58.139 --> 35:01.099
[gasps]

35:13.153 --> 35:15.547
â™ª

35:21.858 --> 35:24.773
[groaning]

35:24.818 --> 35:26.340
Buffy?

35:26.385 --> 35:28.168
You're awake?

35:28.213 --> 35:30.344
Yeah.

35:30.389 --> 35:33.000
I can't feel my face.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.393
What do you mean?

35:34.436 --> 35:35.568
My face.

35:35.610 --> 35:36.612
My face is numb.

35:36.655 --> 35:37.918
What is she doing?

35:37.960 --> 35:41.268
I don't know.

35:42.704 --> 35:45.186
[grunts]

35:45.230 --> 35:47.275
What does that mean?

35:47.318 --> 35:49.842
I don't know.

35:53.889 --> 35:55.804
[grunting]

35:55.849 --> 35:58.721
That should give us
a few minutes, but we've bet--

35:58.764 --> 36:00.635
If we don't get out
of this room soon--

36:00.679 --> 36:03.248
Why is Marcie doing this?

36:03.291 --> 36:04.771
The loneliness,
the constant exile.

36:04.813 --> 36:06.251
She's--
[coughs]

36:06.293 --> 36:07.990
She has gone mad.

36:08.034 --> 36:09.601
You think?

36:09.644 --> 36:11.125
[coughs]

36:16.391 --> 36:18.827
MARCIE: You know,
I'm disappointed.

36:18.871 --> 36:23.181
I really hoped you guys
had figured it out by now.

36:23.224 --> 36:25.443
Well, why don't
you explain it?

36:25.487 --> 36:27.532
Come on, Marcie, what are
we supposed to learn?

36:27.576 --> 36:29.838
Yeah, what do you
want to teach us?

36:29.882 --> 36:32.146
MARCIE:
You don't get it.
You're not the student.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.233
You're the lesson.

36:33.277 --> 36:35.409
What did you do
to my face?

36:35.454 --> 36:36.889
Your face.

36:36.932 --> 36:38.413
That's what this is
all about, isn't it?

36:38.456 --> 36:41.023
Your beautiful face.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.592
It's what makes you shine
just a little bit brighter

36:43.635 --> 36:45.420
than the rest of us.

36:45.463 --> 36:47.248
We all want what you have.

36:47.291 --> 36:50.208
To be noticed,
remembered.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.992
To be seen.

36:52.034 --> 36:54.036
What are you doing?

36:54.081 --> 36:57.650
I'm fulfilling
your fondest wish.

36:57.693 --> 36:59.695
I'm gonna give you a face

36:59.739 --> 37:02.219
no one will ever forget.

37:02.262 --> 37:04.918
[gas hissing][coughing]

37:08.617 --> 37:11.054
One, two, three!

37:11.097 --> 37:14.231
Again.

37:14.275 --> 37:16.233
Marcie, you can't do this.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.757
MARCIE:
What are you gonna do-- slay me?

37:18.800 --> 37:21.239
Marcie, you know this is wrong.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.327
MARCIE: You should've
stayed out of my way.

37:23.371 --> 37:26.809
You know, I-I thought--
I thought you would understand
my vision,

37:26.853 --> 37:28.681
But you're just like them.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.900
Please don't do this.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.164
No...

37:35.295 --> 37:36.775
No!

37:36.818 --> 37:38.559
[cries]

37:38.603 --> 37:41.389
You should be grateful.
I mean, people who

37:41.432 --> 37:42.782
pass you on the street
are gonna remember you

37:42.824 --> 37:44.478
for the rest of their lives.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.393
Children are gonna
dream about you.

37:46.438 --> 37:48.353
And every one
of your, your friends

37:48.396 --> 37:49.614
who comes
to the coronation tonight

37:49.657 --> 37:51.704
will take the sight
of the May Queen

37:51.746 --> 37:54.532
to their graves.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.056
Wait!

37:56.099 --> 37:58.753
No, we really have
to get started.

37:58.797 --> 38:00.494
The local anesthetic's
gonna wear off soon.

38:00.539 --> 38:02.018
I don't want you to faint.

38:02.061 --> 38:04.411
It's less fun
if you're not awake.

38:05.543 --> 38:07.632
You guys are, uh...

38:07.675 --> 38:10.548
I'm blacking out on you.

38:13.768 --> 38:17.032
MARCIE:
Let me see.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.166
I think we should start
with your smile.

38:19.208 --> 38:22.168
I think it
should be wider.

38:22.211 --> 38:24.389
Marcie,
I know you think

38:24.431 --> 38:27.304
I don't understand,
but I do.

38:27.347 --> 38:29.523
MARCIE:
Yeah, I'll bet
you know how I feel.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.483
I'm sure you can just be
with all your friends

38:31.525 --> 38:34.398
and feel so alone 'cause
they don't really know you.

38:34.442 --> 38:36.009
You're just a typical

38:36.052 --> 38:37.619
self-involved, spoiled
little brat, and you think

38:37.663 --> 38:39.317
you can charm your way
out of this, don't you?

38:39.360 --> 38:40.360
Isn't that what you think?

38:40.405 --> 38:41.362
[screams]

38:41.405 --> 38:42.668
[gasps]

38:42.710 --> 38:46.324
I see right
through you.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.586
[both grunt]

38:48.630 --> 38:49.675
Come on...

38:49.717 --> 38:51.632
[screams]

38:51.677 --> 38:53.766
Oh, my God!
Get me out of here, please.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.550
Just hold still!

38:55.594 --> 38:57.030
[grunting]

38:57.072 --> 38:59.858
[shrieks]

38:59.902 --> 39:02.862
[crying]:
Oh, my God!

39:11.130 --> 39:13.132
Come on!

39:22.751 --> 39:25.231
[coughing]

39:25.275 --> 39:26.668
What happened?

39:26.711 --> 39:28.409
You tell me.

39:28.452 --> 39:29.844
I'm up, Mom.

39:29.889 --> 39:32.152
Hi.
What do you want?

39:32.195 --> 39:35.110
I brought you The Codex.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.112
I came in through the basement.
 I smelled the gas.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.550
Yes, we will shut it off,

39:38.592 --> 39:39.942
otherwise the whole
building will go up.

39:39.985 --> 39:41.291
I'll get it.

39:41.335 --> 39:42.902
It's not like
I need the oxygen.

39:42.945 --> 39:45.208
Come on, let's
get out of here.

39:45.251 --> 39:47.253
[coughing]

39:50.344 --> 39:52.737
[gas hissing]

39:54.869 --> 39:57.177
You know, I really
felt sorry for you.

39:57.219 --> 39:59.092
You suffered.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.833
There's one thing I really
didn't factor into all this.

40:01.876 --> 40:05.054
You're a thundering loony.

40:05.097 --> 40:06.403
Buffy, are you okay?

40:06.447 --> 40:07.447
[grunts]

40:07.492 --> 40:08.449
[screams]

40:08.492 --> 40:10.538
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God...

40:10.581 --> 40:12.105
Aah!

40:12.148 --> 40:13.411
[screams]
Buffy!

40:13.454 --> 40:15.282
Oh, my God!

40:15.324 --> 40:16.282
[screams]

40:16.326 --> 40:18.284
Buffy!

40:18.327 --> 40:20.766
Oh, my God.
[sobbing]

40:20.809 --> 40:22.114
[grunts]

40:22.157 --> 40:23.943
MARCIE:
Hey, moron, I'm invisible.

40:23.985 --> 40:25.597
[grunts]

40:25.639 --> 40:27.599
How you gonna
fight someone you can't see?

40:27.641 --> 40:30.036
Oh, my God...

40:30.079 --> 40:31.603
[Cordelia sobbing]

40:31.646 --> 40:33.735
Cordelia, shut up.

40:33.778 --> 40:36.434
Okay.

40:57.802 --> 40:58.847
[creaking]

40:58.891 --> 40:59.978
[shouts]

41:07.813 --> 41:10.076
I see you.

41:11.380 --> 41:13.471
[grunts]

41:13.514 --> 41:15.646
Everybody,
stay where you are!

41:19.476 --> 41:21.434
FBI!
Nobody move!

41:21.478 --> 41:24.612
Okay, we'll take it
from here now, ma'am.

41:24.655 --> 41:26.309
Take what from where?

41:26.353 --> 41:27.572
I'm Agent Doyle.
This is Agent Manetti.

41:27.614 --> 41:29.137
We're here for the girl.

41:29.181 --> 41:30.530
Well, where were you
ten minutes ago

41:30.574 --> 41:31.923
when she was playing surgeon?

41:31.967 --> 41:33.447
I'm sorry. We came
as fast as we could.

41:33.490 --> 41:35.143
Ow, my jaw.We'll take it from here on.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.842
Come on.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.320
You can cure her?

41:38.364 --> 41:41.019
We can... rehabilitate her.

41:41.063 --> 41:42.934
In time,

41:42.978 --> 41:45.110
she'll learn to be a useful
member of society again.

41:45.153 --> 41:47.112
MARCIE:
Where we going?

41:47.155 --> 41:49.070
Very useful.

41:49.114 --> 41:51.726
This isn't the first time
 this has happened, is it?

41:51.769 --> 41:53.858
It's happened
at other schools.

41:53.902 --> 41:56.338
We're not at liberty
to discuss that.

41:56.382 --> 41:58.777
It would be best for you to
forget this whole incident.

41:58.820 --> 42:02.302
Do you know that you guys
are very creepy?

42:02.344 --> 42:04.391
Thank you for your help.

42:04.434 --> 42:06.827
Oh, and, uh...

42:06.871 --> 42:08.525
have a nice day.

42:13.617 --> 42:16.097
Can I get untied now?

42:21.277 --> 42:23.452
[sighs]
Thanks.

42:25.630 --> 42:29.068
I just can't believe
how twisted Marcie got.

42:29.110 --> 42:31.373
By the way, how did you guys
get out of the boiler room?

42:31.418 --> 42:32.679
Oh, well, when the gas
was coming down...

42:32.724 --> 42:34.856
Janitor, um, found us.

42:34.900 --> 42:35.987
Shut the valve off.

42:36.030 --> 42:37.293
We were really lucky.

42:37.336 --> 42:38.425
I'll say.

42:38.467 --> 42:39.686
Hi.

42:41.210 --> 42:42.951
Hey.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.518
Look, um, I didn't get a chance
to say anything yesterday,

42:45.563 --> 42:47.260
with the coronation
and everything,

42:47.302 --> 42:51.132
but, um, I guess I just
want to say thank you.

42:51.177 --> 42:53.396
All of you.

42:53.440 --> 42:55.311
[chuckles]
That's funny,

42:55.355 --> 42:58.052
'cause she looks
like Cordelia--

42:58.097 --> 42:59.315
You really
helped me out yesterday

42:59.358 --> 43:00.489
and you didn't have to,

43:00.534 --> 43:02.188
so thank you.

43:02.231 --> 43:03.492
It's okay.

43:03.536 --> 43:05.146
Listen,
we were gonna grab lunch

43:05.190 --> 43:06.365
in a minute
if you wanted to--

43:06.409 --> 43:08.934
Whoa, you're not hanging

43:08.976 --> 43:11.023
with these losers, are you?

43:11.065 --> 43:13.547
[chuckles]
Are you kidding?

43:13.590 --> 43:16.289
I was just being charitable,

43:16.331 --> 43:18.813
helping them with
their fashion problems.

43:18.856 --> 43:20.335
You think I really felt like

43:20.380 --> 43:23.121
joining that
social leper colony?

43:23.164 --> 43:24.384
Please!

43:24.427 --> 43:25.820
Boy, where's
an invisible girl

43:25.864 --> 43:27.952
when you really
need one?

43:36.875 --> 43:38.137
We think you'll
be happy here.

43:38.179 --> 43:40.313
You should fit right in.

43:44.056 --> 43:45.534
Welcome, Marcie.

43:45.579 --> 43:46.623
MARCIE:
Hey.

43:46.666 --> 43:47.972
Class, this is Marcie.

43:48.016 --> 43:49.322
[classmates saying hello]

43:49.364 --> 43:51.715
Please sit down.

43:54.893 --> 43:56.807
Okay, class,
let's get started.

43:56.851 --> 44:00.114
Everybody turn
to page 54 of your texts.

44:03.422 --> 44:05.032
[Marcie chuckles]

44:05.077 --> 44:07.166
Cool.

44:44.159 --> 44:46.684
Grr. Argh.
