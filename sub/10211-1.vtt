WEBVTT

00:46.172 --> 00:48.132
Cup of coffee?

00:48.675 --> 00:50.635
Thank you.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.390
From around here?

00:55.473 --> 00:56.766
Long time ago.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.353
Things sure as hell
have changed, huh?

01:00.436 --> 01:02.814
Well, things change.

01:04.232 --> 01:08.653
Hey, why don't I just put a little
taste of whiskey in that coffee?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.697
What do you say?

01:10.780 --> 01:12.115
That's nice.

01:12.198 --> 01:13.825
You just sit down
over there.

01:13.908 --> 01:17.412
Relax. You make yourself at home.
I'll bring you the coffee.

01:17.495 --> 01:19.414
Thank you.

01:33.636 --> 01:34.887
What can I do
for you fellas?

01:34.971 --> 01:37.223
You wanna do
something for me?

01:37.724 --> 01:38.808
You can open
the cash register.

01:38.891 --> 01:39.934
All right,
all right.

01:40.018 --> 01:41.227
You just take it easy.

01:41.311 --> 01:42.979
You should leave.

01:44.647 --> 01:47.817
I thought I heard an echo.
Did you hear an echo?

01:50.194 --> 01:51.654
Now.

01:56.367 --> 01:59.203
What the hell
you gonna do, old man?

02:01.122 --> 02:03.374
Drool on me?

02:10.548 --> 02:12.383
Mother...

02:58.096 --> 03:00.973
Where did you learn
to fight like that?

03:01.057 --> 03:02.975
It was long ago.

05:58.985 --> 06:00.695
What the hell
is this?

06:00.778 --> 06:02.530
You read, please.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.710
"To participate in a
test of skill and courage

06:15.793 --> 06:19.380
"against the greatest fighters being
assembled from the four corners..."

06:19.463 --> 06:21.424
I'm invited?

06:29.765 --> 06:31.350
Hey, Georgie!
Yeah.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.643
Get a load of this.

06:48.868 --> 06:50.912
You know what to do.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.665
Let's go, guys!
Let's go!

06:54.749 --> 06:55.833
Come on!

07:04.550 --> 07:06.177
Hey, clown boy.

07:10.848 --> 07:12.767
Get off of my street.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.352
Wait a minute.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.398
Hey, Dubois.

07:20.358 --> 07:22.318
What are you, sick in
the head or something?

07:22.401 --> 07:23.611
Please. Grow up,

07:23.694 --> 07:26.948
go get yourself some decent
clothes and come work for me.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.324
I don't work
for nobody.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.578
It's too bad, Dubois.
It's too bad.

07:32.662 --> 07:35.164
You're a wasted-talent
nutcase, you know that?

07:35.247 --> 07:38.334
Suit yourself.
I got money to make.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.919
Move.

07:41.087 --> 07:42.922
Hey, here.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.697
Please, juggle.

08:12.076 --> 08:16.372
Dubois, I want you and
your kids off the street.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.792
I mean it, Dubois.
This is it.

08:23.045 --> 08:25.548
Move it, kid.
Watch it.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.676
Get down now
or we'll knock you flat.

08:31.095 --> 08:32.722
Grab him!

08:56.954 --> 08:58.164
Some nut, huh?

08:58.247 --> 08:59.623
Yeah.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.268
Get your ass
down here.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.564
Dubois, get down.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.317
You've crossed
the line, Dubois.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.494
Hey, what are
you doing?

09:36.577 --> 09:37.620
Looking for a toilet.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.622
There's no toilet there.
Get lost. Get lost.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.709
Where'd he go?

09:55.387 --> 09:56.764
Did you get it?

09:56.847 --> 09:58.682
There was
nothing there.

09:59.183 --> 10:02.478
It's impossible.
Today's the day.

10:02.937 --> 10:05.147
Nothing, Chief.
Sorry.

10:05.231 --> 10:08.400
Nothing? Nothing.

10:09.527 --> 10:11.695
I don't believe it.

10:22.540 --> 10:23.499
Wow!

10:23.624 --> 10:25.626
Did I
tell you or what? We're rich!

10:25.709 --> 10:27.586
Yeah!
Look at that!

10:27.837 --> 10:30.548
With this, we buy respect.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.425
If we want something,
we take it.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.094
Forever and ever.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.055
Forever and ever!

10:39.849 --> 10:41.809
Billy.
Yes, Chief?

10:41.892 --> 10:44.812
Get us some food.
Some real food.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.981
Go.

10:47.523 --> 10:48.774
Let's celebrate.

10:48.858 --> 10:50.568
Yeah!

10:57.074 --> 10:58.993
Good night.
Good night.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.330
I'm so full
I could bust.

11:03.414 --> 11:07.251
Red, you go to bed. See
you in the morning, kids.

11:29.565 --> 11:31.025
Dubois!

11:34.820 --> 11:37.823
Hand me the dough, clown,
or the kid's dead.

11:39.283 --> 11:42.328
Easy, easy. The kid had
nothing to do with it.

11:42.411 --> 11:45.122
Shut your mouth
and hand me the bag!

11:48.125 --> 11:51.462
You heard him,
Dubois. Hand it over.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.465
Count it.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.679
Nobody steals from me.
Nobody.

12:14.652 --> 12:15.819
Billy.

12:17.655 --> 12:18.948
Oh, Billy.

12:19.323 --> 12:22.284
It's okay. It's okay.
He's gonna be fine.

12:22.368 --> 12:25.204
The cops are gonna
blame you, Chris.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.916
Chris. Chris!

12:28.999 --> 12:32.378
They're gonna kill you!
Get outta here! Go!

12:32.461 --> 12:37.383
Red, you're in charge now. No matter
what happens, I'll come back.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.343
I swear to God.
I'll come back.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.017
This way!
Down here!

12:49.561 --> 12:51.897
Put them in the wagon.

12:51.981 --> 12:53.315
All right,
come with me.

12:53.399 --> 12:57.111
Dubois! I'm gonna find you
and I'm gonna kill you!

12:57.194 --> 13:00.698
Dubois! Dubois!

13:04.535 --> 13:07.538
Check the exits! Watch the docks!
He's here somewhere!

13:07.621 --> 13:11.041
Move it! Check under the girders!
Dubois!

13:22.928 --> 13:25.889
Check the cargo. Look
around those boxes.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.982
What was that?

13:35.065 --> 13:36.358
By the warehouse!
Move out!

13:39.737 --> 13:41.405
Check the two bins
there.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.324
Check the cargo bay.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.912
Under there.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.043
Keep moving.

15:02.319 --> 15:05.572
Your mother's health isn't
improving, and her money's gone.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.491
I rather doubt
she'll be coming.

15:28.095 --> 15:31.515
Now, Christopher, be a good
boy and stay right here.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.809
I'll be back.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.894
Don't move.
Don't move!

15:58.375 --> 16:00.878
What is this?

16:05.424 --> 16:07.134
A stowaway.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.720
You'll work for us.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.221
Put him in chains.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.639
Wait.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.600
Come on.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.082
Back to work.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.712
I come to say goodbye.

17:25.796 --> 17:30.259
It's a shame,
but even good things

17:30.842 --> 17:33.303
come to an end.

17:34.096 --> 17:39.851
Yes. I'm sure
the sharks will enjoy you.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.253
Hit the boiler room.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.433
Grappling irons, now!

18:19.516 --> 18:20.559
Cast!

18:25.522 --> 18:27.190
Fire at Will!

18:48.086 --> 18:50.464
Come on, boys.
The Turk's ours.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.944
Harry,
who the hell's that?

19:47.104 --> 19:48.897
We're even.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.621
Hey, you're losing
your aim, Dobbsy.

20:04.705 --> 20:06.623
What's your name, son?

20:07.207 --> 20:09.251
Christopher Dubois.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.881
Mine's Dobbs.
Lord Dobbs.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.885
And how can we be of
service, Christopher Dubois?

20:19.511 --> 20:22.389
I need to find a ship
back to America.

20:22.472 --> 20:26.017
America, eh?
Well, you're in luck.

20:26.101 --> 20:29.187
We might just find one
on Muay Thai Island.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.565
Muay Thai Island?
No...

20:31.648 --> 20:32.774
Trust me.

20:32.858 --> 20:33.984
Yes, sir.

20:34.067 --> 20:37.738
You are now the guest of Admiral
Dobbs and Harry Smithe.

20:39.656 --> 20:42.868
The last of the buccaneers.
Come aboard.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.786
Thanks.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.347
Piece of shit.

21:04.848 --> 21:07.642
Muay Thai Island
off the bow!

21:14.941 --> 21:17.235
Muay Thai Island, Chris.

21:17.319 --> 21:19.738
Where my good friend Mr.
Khao will take care of you.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.830
Hurry it up, lads.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.335
Quickly as you can
with those boxes, boys.

22:15.418 --> 22:18.088
I want to get this tide
out of here.

22:18.171 --> 22:20.882
Khao, my old friend.
Nice to see you.

22:20.966 --> 22:23.134
How are you?
How's business?

22:25.595 --> 22:26.847
That good,eh?

22:26.930 --> 22:30.100
Well, I have a few interesting
items I picked up on the way here.

22:31.935 --> 22:34.271
Perfect for
insurrections.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.023
But I have something
even better.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.733
Harry. Bring Chris
over here.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.026
Come on.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.904
Watch the way
the boy moves.

22:42.988 --> 22:44.906
Chris Dubois from the
United States of America,

22:44.990 --> 22:47.450
the best fighter
I've ever seen.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.453
Oh, Chris. Khao here was
saying he's going to make sure

22:50.537 --> 22:52.747
you catch the boat that comes
here from the States next month.

22:52.831 --> 22:53.957
Dobbsy...

22:54.040 --> 22:56.585
Yes. Khao,
I suggest we step inside.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.962
Dobbsy, boat?

22:59.796 --> 23:03.967
Wait here, kid. We're gonna fix you
up nice with our friends here.

23:08.930 --> 23:10.974
It's daylight
bloody robbery.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.727
He could get killed in the first
fight, Dobbsy. Then what do I have?

23:13.810 --> 23:16.396
But the boy is good. I've seen him fight.
Have I ever lied to you?

23:16.479 --> 23:19.816
This is the offer.
Take it or leave it.

23:35.707 --> 23:38.168
Hey, kid! Kid!

23:40.462 --> 23:43.465
This is gonna turn out
to be your lucky day.

23:43.548 --> 23:44.758
Great news, Chris.

23:44.841 --> 23:48.428
There is a ship due in two
weeks, and you are on it.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.430
No need to thank us.

23:52.182 --> 23:57.062
Remember what I told you.
Watch out for your tail.

23:58.647 --> 24:00.690
Watch my tail.

24:02.525 --> 24:04.402
Harry.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.785
How many weeks?

24:20.919 --> 24:22.295
This is great.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.506
Dobbsy, this is gonna be
the best one we ever had.

24:24.589 --> 24:27.717
I do hate long goodbyes.

25:10.051 --> 25:11.761
Be ready at all times.

25:11.845 --> 25:13.847
You will learn that.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.766
Or you'll never become
Muay Thai fighter.

26:36.554 --> 26:39.849
I need some help.
Take me home.

26:41.476 --> 26:44.521
And take care of Billy,
Red, the kids.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.973
Hey. Leave him alone.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.241
Yeah. Always be ready.

28:03.683 --> 28:04.893
Well.

28:08.438 --> 28:09.981
Forget it, Dobbs.

28:10.064 --> 28:13.610
£50 says I can gain her
most intimate confidence.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.905
Come on, Dobbs.

28:16.988 --> 28:18.156
Trust me, Harry.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.908
Waiter?
Yes, sir.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.620
The young lady
who just came in,

28:23.703 --> 28:28.166
would you ask her if she'd care to
partake of a flute of champagne?

28:28.249 --> 28:29.375
Say it came from...

28:29.459 --> 28:30.627
Lord Dobbs?

28:30.710 --> 28:35.048
Yes, sir. Castle in Scotland,
factories in Singapore.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.132
Smart lad.

28:36.216 --> 28:37.300
Thank you.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.305
Castle in Scotland?

28:42.388 --> 28:43.973
Excuse me, miss.

28:44.432 --> 28:47.769
The gentleman over there
would like to see you.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.482
Thank you.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.620
I'm sorry. Do we
know one another?

29:05.703 --> 29:07.205
I can't be sure,
Miss...

29:07.288 --> 29:08.414
Newton.

29:08.498 --> 29:09.666
Miss Newton.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.334
Maybe it was
my castle in Scotland

29:11.417 --> 29:13.586
or our vineyards
in the south of France?

29:13.670 --> 29:14.754
No.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.548
No matter. I shall
remember, Miss Newton.

29:17.632 --> 29:19.175
By the way,
I'm Lord Edgar Dobbs,

29:19.259 --> 29:23.179
and this is the president of my
company, Harry Smithe, with an

29:23.263 --> 29:24.430
Ma'am.

29:24.514 --> 29:27.183
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Carrie Newton.

29:27.517 --> 29:29.310
Miss Carrie Newton.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.105
Will you join us?

29:32.188 --> 29:33.898
Well, I just came in
for some refreshment.

29:33.982 --> 29:36.901
Well, then, take it
with us, please.

29:37.568 --> 29:40.405
All right.
Thank you, my Lord.

29:40.488 --> 29:41.864
Edgar

29:43.116 --> 29:45.535
Let's dispense
with silly titles.

29:47.036 --> 29:50.039
So, what brings you to the
Orient, if I may inquire?

29:50.123 --> 29:51.916
I'm here
on assignment.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.126
On assignment?

29:54.419 --> 29:55.837
Like a journalist?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.547
Yes.
The New York Globe.

29:58.756 --> 30:01.301
New York Globe, huh?
Hmm.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.136
Maybe we met
through my father.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.345
Your father?

30:04.429 --> 30:07.015
Howard Newton.
He owns The Globe.

30:08.391 --> 30:10.184
Howard Newton.
Howard Newton.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.061
Oh, yes, a splendid chap.

30:19.402 --> 30:21.612
They do say you can
buy anything you desire

30:21.696 --> 30:23.323
on the streets
of Bangkok.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.533
And what is it
you desire, Lord Dobbs?

30:25.616 --> 30:28.953
A great number of things,
but what about you, my dear?

30:29.037 --> 30:31.080
Well, what
any woman desires.

30:31.164 --> 30:32.206
Oh?

30:32.582 --> 30:34.584
A great story.

31:00.109 --> 31:01.194
What's he saying?

31:01.277 --> 31:02.487
Harry?

31:02.570 --> 31:04.655
Something about Muay
Thai tournament tonight.

31:04.739 --> 31:06.783
Fighting or something.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.785
That's what I desire.

31:09.660 --> 31:12.914
Brutality?
Strictly for the peasants.

31:12.997 --> 31:14.791
I am a journalist.

31:16.334 --> 31:18.795
All right.
Harry will arrange it.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.578
Noisy, isn't it?
Yeah.

31:52.662 --> 31:54.539
I warned you
it was for peasants.

31:54.622 --> 31:56.374
We'll get a seat
over here.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.298
Dobbs!

32:06.259 --> 32:08.886
Khao.
What a lovely surprise.

32:09.887 --> 32:11.556
You are a thief, Dobbs.

32:11.639 --> 32:13.766
You sold me
rusty rifles.

32:13.850 --> 32:16.102
Nothing that
a little oil won't cure.

32:16.185 --> 32:20.273
Nice American lady.
A very important journalist.

32:20.356 --> 32:25.027
Carrie Newton. Very good
friend of Lord Dobbs.

32:26.404 --> 32:29.198
Might write nice things
about Muay Thai fighting.

32:29.282 --> 32:31.826
Make you famous in the
United States of America.

32:31.909 --> 32:35.079
Oh, I see. It's my
pleasure to meet you.

32:35.705 --> 32:39.667
Please, have a seat up there
with my good friend Lord Dobbs.

32:51.888 --> 32:53.222
My God.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.309
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

33:56.786 --> 33:57.870
Let's go.

33:57.954 --> 33:59.997
You have to
get me this story.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.250
I'll arrange it.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.381
Did you see him?

34:08.464 --> 34:09.715
Yes, of course I saw him.
Just keep moving.

34:09.799 --> 34:10.800
Did you see him?

34:10.883 --> 34:12.134
Keep moving.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.223
Chris.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.851
We were looking for you,
weren't we?

34:20.935 --> 34:22.353
Yeah, we were
looking for you.

34:23.396 --> 34:25.606
Good to
see you again, my boy.

34:25.690 --> 34:28.150
You've put on
a little muscle.

34:29.986 --> 34:33.322
You've become famous. I
always said you'd make it.

34:33.906 --> 34:34.907
Didn't I?

34:34.991 --> 34:35.992
Mmm-hmm.

34:36.075 --> 34:37.702
You owe me.

34:39.579 --> 34:43.457
Yes, I do, Chris, and I
always repay my debts.

34:44.709 --> 34:45.960
What do you want?

34:46.043 --> 34:47.712
The golden dragon.

34:48.629 --> 34:50.047
Golden what?

34:50.214 --> 34:52.800
The golden dragon
in the Lost City.

34:53.718 --> 34:55.094
Lost City?

34:55.177 --> 34:58.264
The best fighters will
meet to compete in secret

34:58.347 --> 35:01.225
for a big dragon
made of solid gold.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.645
Solid gold.
Solid gold.

35:10.026 --> 35:12.111
You think you can win?

35:16.907 --> 35:18.117
No.

35:19.410 --> 35:21.704
You're learning.

35:22.913 --> 35:25.875
What exactly
do you want me to do?

35:25.958 --> 35:28.961
You buy me back from Khao and
finance my trip to the Lost City.

35:29.045 --> 35:30.671
Carrie Newton.

35:33.382 --> 35:35.259
What'd I miss?

35:36.469 --> 35:39.972
Chris, my son, it is fortuitous,
us meeting like this.

35:40.056 --> 35:42.433
A bloody gold dragon, eh?
Well, I'll tell you what.

35:42.516 --> 35:46.437
You get us to the Lost City,
and I'll make sure that you...

35:47.313 --> 35:50.900
We come back
with the gold dragon.

35:55.029 --> 35:56.530
Deal.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.325
Deal.

35:59.408 --> 36:00.701
Yeah, Newman,
I got it.

36:00.785 --> 36:02.161
No, it's "Newton."

36:02.244 --> 36:04.747
N-E-W-T-O-N.

36:09.502 --> 36:11.337
Do you have a table?

36:11.420 --> 36:12.672
Lord Dobbs.

36:12.755 --> 36:15.549
It's all right,
waiter. He's with us.

36:18.094 --> 36:20.012
I need a way
to get on the journey.

36:20.096 --> 36:21.681
Find your own, lady.

36:22.932 --> 36:25.976
Well, how about at least
printing a teaser on the story?

36:26.060 --> 36:30.523
Okay, you get me a photo, and I
might get it in "Around the World."

36:30.606 --> 36:32.775
Wait. Here's the wire.

36:32.858 --> 36:36.696
Aren't you the one we sent to the
Orient to get out of our hair?

36:37.530 --> 36:40.199
Hello! Hey, Newman, you there?

36:41.158 --> 36:42.702
Oh, my God.

36:42.785 --> 36:43.911
Hello!

36:43.994 --> 36:46.038
You see, Chris,

36:46.122 --> 36:50.334
the problem is that you can't get
into this wretched Ghan-gheng thing

36:50.418 --> 36:52.628
without
a special invitation.

36:54.296 --> 36:55.381
We'll forge it.

36:55.464 --> 36:56.674
Impossible.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.551
Apparently, it has
a map on it,

36:58.634 --> 37:01.137
so we are faced
with a real dilemma.

37:04.974 --> 37:06.392
Good morning,
gentlemen.

37:06.475 --> 37:08.310
Good morning,
Miss Newton.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.229
What are you
so cheerful about?

37:10.312 --> 37:14.525
Because, my Lord, I hold in my
hand your ticket to that journey.

37:14.608 --> 37:17.611
Not so fast.
First we make a deal.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.197
What kind of deal?

37:20.281 --> 37:22.658
I go with you
to the Ghan-gheng.

37:26.078 --> 37:27.413
How do we know
it's good?

37:27.496 --> 37:29.790
Oh, it's good.
It's very good.

37:30.958 --> 37:33.586
Without it,
your plans are worthless.

37:50.770 --> 37:54.231
That's me. Devine. I need some help.
Come with me.

38:13.626 --> 38:15.544
Mr. Devine?
That's me.

38:15.628 --> 38:17.379
Welcome to Bangkok.

38:17.463 --> 38:20.466
I am Edgar Dobbs of the
Ghan-gheng committee.

38:20.549 --> 38:24.845
This is Harry Smithe and Christopher
Dubois, your personal valet.

38:25.513 --> 38:27.932
Hey, this is great. I thought
I was gonna get stuck

38:28.015 --> 38:30.309
with a couple of little Oriental
fellas didn't speak no English.

38:30.392 --> 38:33.187
Not for you, Champ.
Chris, the bags.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.319
Dobbs, I'm gonna kill you.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.862
Not yet. Remember,

38:41.946 --> 38:45.366
it's thieves with pride that
dangle from the gallows.

38:46.450 --> 38:47.493
Who said that?

38:47.576 --> 38:50.329
Edgar Dobbs,
Ivory Coast, 1920.

38:53.749 --> 38:57.253
Besides, Chris, my son, we
have an almost perfect plan.

39:01.048 --> 39:03.008
Maxie has the map
and the invitation

39:03.092 --> 39:05.469
that are going to
get us into the Lost City.

39:05.553 --> 39:08.430
All that will be
on his mind is fighting.

39:09.473 --> 39:12.184
Miss Newton is off getting
her story of the century

39:12.268 --> 39:15.980
and in the meantime, you,
Harry and yours truly

39:16.063 --> 39:20.568
will be devising ways and
means of stealing the Dragon.

39:21.986 --> 39:24.488
Yeah.
Sounds good to me.

39:24.572 --> 39:25.656
Good?

39:25.948 --> 39:27.449
It is perfect.

39:28.117 --> 39:31.287
All we have to do is keep
the champ in our pocket.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.500
So, we ready to go?

39:36.792 --> 39:38.210
Thank you.

39:38.294 --> 39:39.837
Well, now,
who is this?

39:39.920 --> 39:41.046
Carrie Newton.

39:41.130 --> 39:44.884
It's a pleasure to meet the
Heavyweight Champion of the World.

39:44.967 --> 39:46.302
Is she going with us?

39:46.385 --> 39:48.596
Somebody's got to record
this historic event.

39:48.679 --> 39:50.097
Let's get going.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.892
Her father owns
the New York Globe.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.395
Well, whoop-de-doo.
All right, everybody,

39:56.478 --> 39:58.647
let's make
a pretty picture.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.444
Smile.

40:04.278 --> 40:06.196
Come on. Smile!

40:32.890 --> 40:34.850
Now what?

40:36.101 --> 40:37.686
Trust me.

40:45.611 --> 40:48.113
Man, boss, these
elephants are busting my rump.

40:48.197 --> 40:50.324
Oh, stop
complaining, Harry.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.826
We could be back
in Cairo on camels.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.791
Where'd you get the haircut?
The army?

40:58.874 --> 41:01.919
No, I'm... I'm a sailor.

41:04.088 --> 41:07.299
I'll tell you what. You look like
you're in pretty good shape.

41:07.383 --> 41:10.135
I'll work you out, give you
a few pointers. Who knows?

41:10.219 --> 41:11.762
Maybe you'd make
a good fighter.

41:11.845 --> 41:14.640
Now that's the way
to earn some money.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.725
Yeah.

41:19.311 --> 41:21.355
Yep, that's a pretty lady.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.993
Oh, my aching rump.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.245
Elephants.

41:40.582 --> 41:42.751
From now on in,
it's horses.

42:05.774 --> 42:09.111
Dobbs. I'm gonna
go for a walk.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.947
Be careful, boyo.

42:16.994 --> 42:18.787
Taking one?

42:31.633 --> 42:33.135
A funeral.

42:34.762 --> 42:38.098
No headstones. That's how
they bury thieves here.

42:39.058 --> 42:41.518
Makes them
give back to the earth.

42:45.147 --> 42:48.150
Hey, Dobbs, what do
you drink with tonic?

42:49.109 --> 42:51.028
Don't tell me.

42:51.945 --> 42:52.946
Gin.

42:53.030 --> 42:55.240
I said don't tell me.

42:57.117 --> 42:58.660
Shut up, you!

43:26.772 --> 43:28.524
The Americans!

43:29.024 --> 43:31.568
Welcome to
our humble inn.

43:32.277 --> 43:33.654
Thank you.

43:49.628 --> 43:51.505
What the hell is this?

43:51.713 --> 43:53.715
Fresh-killed
cobra, Champ.

43:54.383 --> 43:58.512
Well, I always say one should
never eat on an empty stomach.

44:00.305 --> 44:01.807
I'm for that.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.408
Well, isn't this
a small world?

44:19.992 --> 44:24.079
Khao, my old friend, I just
realized I owed you some money.

44:25.831 --> 44:26.999
Harry?

44:27.583 --> 44:28.834
You didn't pay him?

44:28.917 --> 44:32.796
No, he didn't pay me. He's a thief.
I'm used to him.

44:34.923 --> 44:36.550
But you...

44:36.633 --> 44:38.051
You are worse.

44:38.135 --> 44:41.513
You'll dare go to the
Ghan-gheng to fight against us,

44:41.972 --> 44:45.559
after we've trained you in the
ways of the Muay Thai warrior.

44:45.642 --> 44:49.605
You got it all wrong, pops.
He ain't gonna fight. I am.

44:51.106 --> 44:52.524
Correct.

44:54.193 --> 44:57.571
That is correct. This is
Maxie Devine, the Champ.

44:58.238 --> 45:00.115
You are a fighter?

45:01.408 --> 45:02.743
What are
you talking about?

45:02.826 --> 45:03.994
What the hell's
going on here?

45:04.077 --> 45:06.288
He's just talking nonsense.
Don't take any notice.

45:13.921 --> 45:16.882
It's gone awful
quiet in here, hasn't it?

45:18.091 --> 45:20.052
Now, as I was saying,

45:20.135 --> 45:24.723
before I was so rudely
interrupted by Mr. Khao,

45:24.806 --> 45:28.602
who doesn't know his
armpit from his elbow...

45:44.034 --> 45:48.288
Excuse me, honorable sir.
We need this table.

45:49.998 --> 45:51.083
So do we.

45:51.166 --> 45:52.251
But we...

45:52.334 --> 45:55.295
You heard him!
Now beat it.

46:03.011 --> 46:04.930
I said...

46:08.308 --> 46:10.769
I said,
"Do you speak English?"

46:10.852 --> 46:13.063
He knows
what you're saying.

46:15.816 --> 46:17.693
Hey, pal, scram.

46:21.363 --> 46:23.657
Easy, kid.
It ain't worth it.

46:44.177 --> 46:46.638
What the hell is this?

46:46.722 --> 46:49.599
That's what you'll face
at the Ghan-gheng.

46:54.730 --> 46:56.732
Good morning, Champ.

46:56.815 --> 47:01.111
Good morning, my ass. You
think I was born yesterday?

47:01.194 --> 47:04.865
You don't have anything to do with
this damn Ghan-gheng, do you?

47:04.948 --> 47:07.826
Huh? And you're
no valet, either.

47:07.909 --> 47:10.829
You're nothing but
a cheap, lying punk.

47:10.912 --> 47:11.955
Take it easy.

47:12.039 --> 47:13.790
Take it easy?

47:13.874 --> 47:18.086
You ain't no fighter, either. You
wouldn't last one round in a real fight.

47:18.170 --> 47:19.504
What do you think
of that?

47:19.588 --> 47:20.672
Hey.

47:25.093 --> 47:26.720
You want some?

47:30.599 --> 47:32.726
Come on. Come on!

47:47.240 --> 47:48.700
Maxie.

47:49.951 --> 47:51.453
No more.

47:54.748 --> 47:56.208
No more.

48:16.603 --> 48:18.730
Is this what
you're after?

48:50.387 --> 48:52.931
So what are you
looking so glum about?

48:53.014 --> 48:54.975
"Maxie Devine."

49:27.215 --> 49:30.677
This is Maxie Devine,
Champion of America.

50:07.672 --> 50:09.716
Welcome to Ghan-gheng.

50:16.515 --> 50:19.768
Kishu Yama from Japan.

50:36.493 --> 50:39.037
Phang Prahan of Siam.

50:40.872 --> 50:42.624
I am Phang.

50:48.505 --> 50:50.757
Maxie Devine
of America.

50:52.259 --> 50:53.718
That's me.

50:55.804 --> 50:58.974
Maxie Devine, Heavyweight
Champion of the World.

51:04.104 --> 51:06.815
This man is a better
fighter than me,

51:07.482 --> 51:10.360
and as the former
Heavyweight Champion,

51:13.655 --> 51:15.865
I turn my title
over to him.

51:23.290 --> 51:26.376
This here's your man,
Christopher Dubois.

51:37.846 --> 51:40.098
Dubois will be
granted a chance

51:40.181 --> 51:43.977
to prove if he is a worthy
combatant in the first round.

51:44.561 --> 51:48.648
If not, Maxie Devine
shall pay the penalty

51:48.732 --> 51:51.568
and never leave
the Lost City.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.466
That thing
is bigger than I thought.

52:22.724 --> 52:24.768
Why did you come back?

52:27.270 --> 52:29.648
I've been champion
a long time,

52:29.939 --> 52:33.568
and you beat me, with your
legs and with your speed.

52:35.070 --> 52:38.073
Besides, when I got the
invitation to come here

52:38.156 --> 52:42.786
I decided I was gonna see the American
flag flying at the end of this thing.

52:43.453 --> 52:46.164
I don't know
what's on your mind, Chris,

52:46.247 --> 52:49.250
but I do know a champion
when I meet one,

52:49.334 --> 52:52.379
and I'm here to see
that you fight like one.

52:54.756 --> 52:56.508
Now you know why.

53:29.207 --> 53:31.459
Here in the Lost City,

53:31.543 --> 53:33.795
at the top of the world,

53:34.546 --> 53:37.716
we greet our first heroes.

53:39.509 --> 53:42.804
In this mystical arena,

53:42.887 --> 53:46.558
there are no masks,
just truth.

53:49.352 --> 53:51.312
I wish you well.

54:08.621 --> 54:12.792
Soviet Union against Spain.

55:11.893 --> 55:13.561
Damn.

55:30.203 --> 55:33.540
Japan
against Okinawa.

56:15.540 --> 56:19.419
France against Brazil.

57:37.246 --> 57:40.875
China against Korea.

58:18.079 --> 58:20.415
He's moving
like an animal.

58:23.710 --> 58:25.461
More like a snake.

58:33.636 --> 58:37.265
Harry, our little
pension fund.

58:37.765 --> 58:38.975
Yeah.

58:40.393 --> 58:44.105
Hey, boss, how come there ain't
nobody watching this thing?

58:44.188 --> 58:47.442
Well, 'cause they don't
think anybody can lift it.

58:50.528 --> 58:51.779
All right, let's see
what you got.

58:51.863 --> 58:53.406
Come on. Let's go.

58:55.450 --> 58:56.909
Chris, how are
you feeling?

58:56.993 --> 58:58.202
The kid's a winner.

58:58.286 --> 59:01.122
Of course he is,
for at least one round.

59:01.706 --> 59:03.750
I mean,
for your sake.

59:04.125 --> 59:06.377
After all, you don't
want to become

59:06.461 --> 59:09.422
a permanent resident
of the Lost City, do you?

59:09.505 --> 59:11.632
You should be
in training.

59:14.886 --> 59:16.846
I know you're gonna
win the first round.

59:16.929 --> 59:17.930
Yeah.

59:18.014 --> 59:19.849
You're gonna win
the whole thing.

59:19.932 --> 59:22.393
You gonna split
the prize with them?

59:22.477 --> 59:24.145
We have a deal.

59:24.979 --> 59:26.481
So do we.

59:33.780 --> 59:37.533
Turkey against
Scotland.

1:00:51.149 --> 1:00:54.819
Siam against Africa.

1:02:09.977 --> 1:02:13.981
Germany against
United States.

1:02:15.608 --> 1:02:17.610
Chris, now, I don't
know about you,

1:02:17.693 --> 1:02:19.654
but I plan on seeing
Times Square again.

1:02:19.737 --> 1:02:21.197
Get him!

1:04:09.597 --> 1:04:11.390
He's outclassed.

1:04:15.978 --> 1:04:19.106
Hope you enjoy Christmas
in the Lost City.

1:04:21.609 --> 1:04:23.277
New York City!

1:04:44.465 --> 1:04:45.758
Yeah!

1:05:01.273 --> 1:05:03.984
Yeah! Yeah!

1:05:18.374 --> 1:05:21.877
Mongolia
against Greece.

1:06:22.521 --> 1:06:25.065
This guy's
no big deal.

1:06:33.032 --> 1:06:37.203
Japan against Turkey.

1:08:23.225 --> 1:08:25.853
Now he's got a style
like a monkey.

1:08:32.818 --> 1:08:36.572
Mongolia against Siam.

1:09:27.498 --> 1:09:29.500
It's over.
Hit the gong!

1:09:31.752 --> 1:09:32.795
No!

1:09:46.475 --> 1:09:48.310
Phang.

1:09:48.394 --> 1:09:50.104
Chris, sit down!

1:10:29.143 --> 1:10:30.602
Chris?

1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:33.647
We need a little chat.

1:10:34.523 --> 1:10:35.649
Okay.

1:10:36.775 --> 1:10:39.486
Tomorrow you are
throwing the fight.

1:10:42.740 --> 1:10:43.741
Throwing the...

1:10:43.824 --> 1:10:45.868
Taking a dive.
A plunge, kid.

1:10:45.951 --> 1:10:48.454
You see, it is
the perfect setup.

1:10:48.537 --> 1:10:50.581
But that dragon
is so bloody enormous,

1:10:50.664 --> 1:10:54.334
if we're going to lift it out
of here, we need you healthy.

1:10:54.418 --> 1:10:57.629
Well, let's face it.
You have been lucky so far.

1:11:02.176 --> 1:11:04.178
Why the long face?

1:11:04.261 --> 1:11:07.306
I thought this was
your quest, your dream.

1:11:07.389 --> 1:11:09.850
Well, soon
it'll be a reality.

1:11:14.188 --> 1:11:17.191
Harry, I think the kid
needs some rest.

1:11:19.067 --> 1:11:20.986
Sleep well.

1:11:54.061 --> 1:11:57.564
Spain
against United States.

1:13:20.606 --> 1:13:22.774
Up. Get up!

1:13:24.985 --> 1:13:27.821
Get up!

1:13:41.376 --> 1:13:45.464
Yeah! How about that? The kid
can really take a beating.

1:13:57.726 --> 1:13:59.770
It's time
for plan B.

1:14:02.105 --> 1:14:03.815
What's plan B?

1:14:04.608 --> 1:14:06.443
Semifinal.

1:14:06.526 --> 1:14:09.821
Mongolia against Japan.

1:14:09.905 --> 1:14:11.657
See, the winner's
gonna wear himself out,

1:14:11.740 --> 1:14:13.659
then he'll roll
right over for you.

1:14:16.286 --> 1:14:17.955
This is good.

1:15:25.605 --> 1:15:27.524
Lucky punch.

1:15:28.734 --> 1:15:29.901
Yeah.

1:15:31.194 --> 1:15:33.447
Yeah. Lucky punch.

1:15:54.593 --> 1:15:57.429
Come on, Dobbsy!
Dobbs, come on!

1:16:00.974 --> 1:16:03.268
Come on. Dobbs!

1:16:03.894 --> 1:16:05.437
Come on!

1:16:08.899 --> 1:16:10.650
Secure it!

1:16:11.526 --> 1:16:13.236
Semifinal.

1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:16.656
United States against China.

1:16:20.285 --> 1:16:21.870
Tiger.

1:16:44.726 --> 1:16:47.437
Hurry it up!
I can't hold this forever!

1:16:48.396 --> 1:16:50.107
Yeah! All right, Dobbs!

1:16:50.190 --> 1:16:51.274
Is it secure?

1:16:51.358 --> 1:16:53.401
Yeah! What about me?

1:17:00.575 --> 1:17:02.911
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

1:17:04.621 --> 1:17:07.415
Hey, Dobbs!
You bastard!

1:17:07.749 --> 1:17:09.501
What about me?

1:17:09.584 --> 1:17:12.003
I'll see you
outside the gates.

1:17:12.087 --> 1:17:13.964
Trust me, Harry.

1:17:44.494 --> 1:17:46.037
Dobbs, we got company.

1:17:47.747 --> 1:17:49.666
Run for it, Harry!

1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:10.395
Dobbs!

1:18:24.409 --> 1:18:25.952
What a mess.

1:18:26.786 --> 1:18:27.829
Oh, yeah?

1:18:28.997 --> 1:18:31.875
I'm sorry, kid, we
tried to run out on you.

1:18:31.958 --> 1:18:35.086
I guess that's the
difference between us.

1:18:35.629 --> 1:18:39.507
I never ever said I was
sorry before and meant it.

1:18:40.467 --> 1:18:43.011
And I never ever
had a quest

1:18:43.094 --> 1:18:46.139
that wasn't for me,
number one.

1:18:51.186 --> 1:18:53.730
I wasn't always
a pirate, you know.

1:18:54.814 --> 1:18:55.815
Believe it or not,

1:18:55.899 --> 1:19:00.612
for over 20 years I was a genuine
captain in the Royal Navy.

1:19:02.489 --> 1:19:06.493
I raised the Union Jack in
countries you never even heard of,

1:19:07.661 --> 1:19:09.663
fought the Hun
in the Great War.

1:19:09.746 --> 1:19:11.248
For what?

1:19:11.331 --> 1:19:15.543
For the glory of God, the British
Empire and His Majesty the King.

1:19:15.627 --> 1:19:18.964
And when it was all over,
what was I left with?

1:19:24.511 --> 1:19:27.013
Oh, well, you win some,

1:19:28.181 --> 1:19:30.058
you lose some.

1:19:32.769 --> 1:19:36.856
Now, you just watch
your tail, my old son.

1:19:57.002 --> 1:20:01.715
These men have
committed a great sacrilege

1:20:02.424 --> 1:20:04.592
against
this competition.

1:20:05.385 --> 1:20:09.931
Let it be known that the
price for such betrayal

1:20:10.557 --> 1:20:12.475
is death.

1:20:17.564 --> 1:20:19.441
No!

1:20:19.524 --> 1:20:21.901
I will pay
for their freedom.

1:20:23.236 --> 1:20:24.904
I brought them here.

1:20:24.988 --> 1:20:26.906
It's my fault.

1:20:27.907 --> 1:20:30.702
If I win,
they'll go free.

1:20:33.538 --> 1:20:35.623
You'll keep the Dragon.

1:20:49.012 --> 1:20:51.222
This is for good.

1:20:52.599 --> 1:20:54.142
So be it.

1:21:12.285 --> 1:21:14.913
Final event.

1:21:14.996 --> 1:21:19.793
Mongolia
against United States.

1:21:53.993 --> 1:21:55.870
Cover up!

1:22:27.026 --> 1:22:28.403
Yeah!

1:22:31.781 --> 1:22:33.241
Cover up!

1:22:56.097 --> 1:22:57.348
Chris!

1:23:18.119 --> 1:23:21.748
Get up!
Chris! Get up!

1:23:38.598 --> 1:23:40.058
Come on.

1:23:59.702 --> 1:24:02.038
We're dead, Dobbs.
We're dead!

1:24:02.121 --> 1:24:04.791
I won't say it again, Harry.
Shut up!

1:24:53.172 --> 1:24:54.507
Chris!

1:25:03.808 --> 1:25:06.436
Chris, give yourself
some room!

1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:08.896
Chris!

1:25:19.365 --> 1:25:20.783
Chris!

1:25:25.371 --> 1:25:27.874
Boss, this don't
sound good.

1:25:29.542 --> 1:25:31.669
Don't sound
good at all.

1:25:32.378 --> 1:25:36.299
At least while they're shouting,
it means he's still alive.

1:27:03.511 --> 1:27:07.140
Chris, you got him! Now get
in there and finish him!

1:27:07.223 --> 1:27:08.266
Go, go, go!

1:27:08.349 --> 1:27:09.684
Yeah!

1:27:21.070 --> 1:27:22.488
Come on!

1:27:23.156 --> 1:27:24.991
Yeah!

1:27:55.980 --> 1:27:58.232
Come on!

1:28:16.876 --> 1:28:18.419
Yeah!

1:28:23.925 --> 1:28:26.427
You've done it!
Chris!

1:28:27.094 --> 1:28:29.722
Chris! Chris! Chris!

1:28:29.806 --> 1:28:32.225
Chris, it's me,
Maxie! Chris!

1:28:32.642 --> 1:28:34.769
It's all right, kid.

1:28:34.852 --> 1:28:36.395
You did it.

1:28:59.710 --> 1:29:02.046
Christopher
Dubois, we honor you

1:29:02.129 --> 1:29:05.466
as the greatest warrior
of the Ghan-gheng.

1:29:21.315 --> 1:29:23.401
Hey, way to go, Champ-

1:29:23.484 --> 1:29:24.861
Thanks.

1:29:31.450 --> 1:29:34.328
Christopher, now that you are
the undisputed champion,

1:29:34.412 --> 1:29:35.538
I've been thinking.

1:29:35.621 --> 1:29:36.664
About what?

1:29:36.747 --> 1:29:39.166
A plan.
A perfect plan.

1:29:44.297 --> 1:29:47.842
I don't think he wants to
hear about it now, Harry.

1:29:51.012 --> 1:29:53.723
I didn't get
the golden dragon,

1:29:53.806 --> 1:29:56.976
but I returned to New
York, like I promised,

1:29:57.059 --> 1:29:59.645
got the kids
off the streets.

1:29:59.729 --> 1:30:02.315
In the end,
we all did just fine.

1:30:21.918 --> 1:30:26.464
Maxie trained many great fighters
and became a big celebrity.

1:30:27.715 --> 1:30:32.386
Last I heard, Dobbs and Harry opened
a trading post deep in the Amazon.

1:30:33.846 --> 1:30:35.640
Bless their souls.
