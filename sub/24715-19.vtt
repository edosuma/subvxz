ANDY:<i> Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:02.877 --> 00:06.047
May I present detective Kelly Ronson?
Does the sign say come in?

00:06.172 --> 00:09.175
Old homicide of mine might get
reopened off DNA.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.804
Do you remember a guy
that we put away in ’86, Leonard Peeler?

00:12.887 --> 00:14.055
-Black guy?
-ANDY: Right

00:14.139 --> 00:16.141
-Raped and killed a white girl.
-Maybe we missed something.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.852
Did you arrest the wrong man?
Is the person who raped my daughter

00:18.977 --> 00:20.353
still out there, Detective?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.647
I didn’t rape that girl!
I didn’t kill that girl!

00:22.731 --> 00:24.190
I want to know what happened, Leonard.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.067
You want to cover your ass
so you don’t have

00:26.151 --> 00:27.569
to face up to what you’ve done to me!

00:27.694 --> 00:29.529
A jury convicted this guy, Andy.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.240
He didn’t do it, though.
He didn’t do the crime.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.256
The guy was found slumped over
on the stoop at Delancey and Ridge.

00:48.339 --> 00:51.301
No ID, no shoes or shirt,
bleeding from the head.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.678
-Resident of the building called it in.
-He stabbed?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.597
No, shot in the head.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.599
Doc says the bullet
is lodged behind his ear.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.517
The guy should buy a lottery ticket.

01:00.435 --> 01:04.355
-JOHN: How’s he doin'?
-Stable, alert. He’s tough as nails.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.524
-He say who shot him?
-Says he can’t remember.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.819
Or his name or his mother’s name
or his address, even.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.238
-What? Like amnesia?
-That’s what he’s saying.

01:12.906 --> 01:16.618
-You got some doubt?
-Traumatic amnesia can wipe out the event,

01:16.701 --> 01:20.663
like the moment he actually got shot
or maybe a short period before.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.749
But his name, his mother’s name?

01:23.583 --> 01:25.710
No, no one around here
has seen that before.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.755
-Oh. You gonna operate on him?
-Bullet’s lodged in the bone.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.757
Going after it would do
more harm than good.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.884
-Can I talk to him?
-Yeah, just try to keep him calm.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.219
He’s pretty freaked out.

01:37.013 --> 01:38.431
Detective Clark.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.433
-Hi.
-You got shot.

01:41.392 --> 01:44.104
-That’s what they’re telling me.
-And you got no idea who did it?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.396
I really don’t.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.608
Delancey and Ridge, where you were
picked up, you live near there?

01:49.317 --> 01:50.735
I honestly don’t know. I...

01:51.402 --> 01:53.738
-Friends near there?
-I don’t know. You know, maybe.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.700
Maybe like you do
and you’re not ready to remember it yet?

01:57.784 --> 02:00.078
Maybe like maybe.
I... I can’t really say for sure.

02:00.161 --> 02:03.456
So, uh... when does your memory begin?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.251
When the policeman nudged me awake
on the stoop.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.753
Before that, it’s just blank.

02:09.337 --> 02:12.340
Okay, well, uh, I tell you what.
Uh... These detectives are gonna take

02:12.423 --> 02:14.551
a photograph of you
and get your fingerprints.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.427
-What? You think I'm a criminal?
-JOHN: Or you were bonded

02:16.553 --> 02:18.596
or work for the government. There's lots
of places that have prints on file.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.682
-Right, right, got it.
-Okay, we’ll do that, and we’ll go

02:20.765 --> 02:22.934
-from there.
-All right, good, good. 'Cause...

02:23.017 --> 02:26.062
you know, I'd like to know who I am.
You know, it’s pretty distressing,

02:26.146 --> 02:29.649
-if you know what I mean.
-Okay, we'll... we’ll get to work on it.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.492
GIMBLE: DNA doesn’t lie, Your Honor.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.620
And in this case,
the DNA says, "Beyond any doubt."

02:43.079 --> 02:46.666
Leonard Peeler is not the man
who raped and killed Cindy Clifton.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.877
-That’s right!
-If that happens again,

02:48.960 --> 02:51.379
I am clearing the room. Go on.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.631
GIMBLE: Something went wrong here,
Your Honor.

02:53.756 --> 02:57.844
As a result, 18 years of this man’s life
were stolen from him.

02:57.927 --> 03:00.638
-State your case, Counselor.
-GIMBLE: I urge you to grant the motion

03:00.805 --> 03:02.724
to give Leonard Peeler his freedom.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.894
I’ve spoken with ADA Heywood,
and she does not oppose it.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.479
That’s correct, Your Honor,
the state does not oppose,

03:08.688 --> 03:10.815
as long as the dismissal
is without prejudice

03:11.024 --> 03:13.902
as we reserve the right to refile
against Mr. Peeler.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.403
I'm granting the motion.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.906
I’m vacating the conviction,
effective immediately.

03:18.531 --> 03:21.242
Mr. Peeler,
I'm releasing you from custody.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.036
I ask for your patience
during the short time.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.121
-It will take to facilitate that.
-(SIGHS)

03:25.538 --> 03:26.873
Anything further, counsel?

03:27.123 --> 03:28.625
-No, Your Honor.
-No. Thank you, Your Honor.

03:28.791 --> 03:29.959

Prints on this John Doe came up empty.
He had no record.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.598
This guy doesn’t remember squat?

05:07.807 --> 05:10.351
Nothing from before when he got picked up
this morning.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.354
Childhood memories?
What ice cream tastes like? Nothin'?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.648
-That’s what he claims.
-Claims. Exactly.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.609
-My bullshit detector is in the red here.
-Well, Rita and I could head down

05:18.693 --> 05:19.944
to the apartment building
where they found him,

05:20.236 --> 05:22.864
-show his picture around.
-Good. I like that.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.954
-Hey. So they cut Peeler loose?
-Yeah.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.957
Don’t let it get you down, Andy.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.169
You know, I just need
a little time here, guys. Thanks.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.840
Hope you don’t mind.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.218
Maybe a fresh pair
of eyes wouldn’t hurt...

05:44.594 --> 05:47.305
'cause, obviously,
I might have missed something back then.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.227
So, uh, anything jump out at you?

05:55.104 --> 05:58.441
Ann Marie Fusco, she’s who Peeler claimed
he was with the night of the crime.

05:58.649 --> 06:01.486
Yeah, but he wasn’t. And that’s one
of the things that put him away.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.196
it’s Ann Marie Sullivan now.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.323
She might be a good place to start again.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.742
I've been trying to get ahold of her
the last few days.

06:07.825 --> 06:09.786
Did she call back here?
Ann Marie Sullivan?

06:09.911 --> 06:11.496
Not when I’ve been at the desk.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.874
Let’s go talk to her at her job.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.752
-You want me working this with you?
-Yeah.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.338
EDDIE: Where you going?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.633
Now that Peeler’s Sprung,
this case is back to an open homicide.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.676
Yeah, but the DA squad is looking
to take it over.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.345
They called asking for your folder.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.019
No one goes near that thing other
than me or Junior.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.900
If you can get them
to hold off for a week, I'd appreciate it.

06:41.025 --> 06:43.736
I, uh, I’m taking this case
a little personal.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.196

-This is my partner, John Clark.
-I’m completely swamped right now.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.762
-Could we do this later?
-No, I'm sorry.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.265
I left a couple messages for you.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.600
We’re launching a new line
in less than a month.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.770
And to be honest with you,
I'm not exactly eager to get involved

07:17.854 --> 07:20.231
-in this whole thing again.
-We’ll make it brief then.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.651
(SIGHS) I'd appreciate it.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.361
Leonard Peeler’s been released.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.281
Yeah, I heard he might be.
But not acquitted, right?

07:28.531 --> 07:32.869
Right. He still may have been involved,
but, uh, something’s come up.

07:33.244 --> 07:34.620
The DNA and that guy in prison

07:34.704 --> 07:37.206
that Leonard Peeler
supposedly confessed to.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.750
I've been following it in the papers.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.337
As you know, one of the things
that did get him convicted

07:43.421 --> 07:45.339
is him saying
that he was with you that night.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.175
Yeah, and he wasn’t.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.927
Are we really gonna rehash
this whole thing?

07:50.052 --> 07:54.432
-We’re investigating a murder.
-Which took place, what, 20 years ago?

07:54.557 --> 07:56.476
Eighteen, and that doesn’t make
any difference to me.

07:56.642 --> 08:01.939
-How well did you know Peeler back then?
-(SIGHS) Oh. We both worked at Altman’s.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.692
I did weekends
at the costume-jewelry counter.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.944
He was in the loading dock or somethin'.

08:07.612 --> 08:11.199
We’d see each other when I came in,
never outside of work.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.368
And somehow, he knew you lived
in the same area as the DOA girl,

08:14.452 --> 08:16.579
which is why
he tried to use you as an alibi.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.790
I don’t know how he got my address.
Maybe from somebody at work.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.125
Why would he claim that he slept with you,

08:21.209 --> 08:23.836
knowing that the detectives
would come right to you to confirm it?

08:23.920 --> 08:27.131
I’m not a criminal psychologist.
I have no idea.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.467
Now, I'm sorry,
but I gotta get back to work.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.512
But just so we’re clear, Ann Marie,
before we go forward on this

08:32.595 --> 08:36.182
and do everything we can
to put Leonard Peeler back in prison,

08:36.265 --> 08:38.851
and not focus on the possibility
that it was someone else

08:38.935 --> 08:42.813
who still might be out there,
Peeler wasn’t with you that night?

08:43.231 --> 08:44.607
I was alone.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.818
Now, whether he killed that girl or not...

08:48.528 --> 08:51.280
-I don’t know anything about that.
-Why are you so upset?

08:51.405 --> 08:54.283
Because he’s out now,
and he could come after me,

08:54.367 --> 08:56.536
and I don’t want to deal
with this anymore!

still don’t remember nothing, huh?

outside the building this morning?

09:39.537 --> 09:40.538
No, I'm sorry.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.545
Thought you said that apartment
was vacant.

09:48.170 --> 09:52.091

The one upstairs is... I think.

09:52.216 --> 09:54.260
Why does it look like you just swallowed
a bug, Mr. Tollins?

09:54.427 --> 09:55.970
I didn’t. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) I'm not.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.142
-What’s going on in this apartment?
-Nothing, why?

10:01.350 --> 10:02.351
Open it.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.979
Am I allowed to do that...

10:05.521 --> 10:07.607

-Didn’t I just tell you to?

-Working?
-You want to get locked up?

more than 13. Were they all that age?

12:59.028 --> 13:04.241
...he was old-school Italian,
and I was living at home back then.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.078
(SNIFFLES)
My family, they would have disowned me.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.622
Was Leonard Peeler with you that night?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.373
(SOBBING) Yes.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.042
(SIGHS)

13:13.375 --> 13:15.503
I'm so sorry.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.758
(SIGHS)

13:25.054 --> 13:29.517
(SOBS) I was 19.
Once I told the lie, I had to stick to it.

13:30.059 --> 13:33.395
-(SOBBING)
-He spent 18 years in prison.

13:33.562 --> 13:38.984
I know, and I live with the guilt
every single day of it. (SOBS)

13:50.162 --> 13:52.748
Thanks for seeing us, Joe.
This is my partner, John Clark.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.959
-John, nice to meet you.
-You too, Joe.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.294
So, yeah,
I heard about Peeler getting kicked.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.298
-Ann Marie Fusco. You remember her?
-JOE: Sure.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.635
It’s Ann Marie Sullivan now.
And, uh, she just admitted

14:04.718 --> 14:06.679
that she lied
about being with Peeler back then

14:06.762 --> 14:09.723
’cause she didn’t want her dad to know
that she was sleeping with a Black guy.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.100
-You’re kiddin'?
-No.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.351
(SCOFFS)

14:12.476 --> 14:14.687
Well, the planets sure lined up wrong
for Peeler, didn’t they?

14:14.770 --> 14:16.772
(CHUCKLES)
You guys want something to drink?

14:17.189 --> 14:18.399
So...

14:18.941 --> 14:22.444
Peeler didn’t do it, wasn’t involved,
no accomplice, nothing.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.697
So, you came all the way over here
to point that out?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.532
ANDY: The case is open again now, Joe.

14:26.615 --> 14:30.327
I came here to see if maybe you had
any files, any, uh, notes,

14:30.411 --> 14:32.746
any recollections of events
that could help us out.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.290
What I remember...

14:35.708 --> 14:38.210
-it was a good case.
-Well, it wasn’t.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.880
Your informant
who claimed Peeler confessed to him,

14:40.963 --> 14:44.258
the DNA, the timeline that we forced
Peeler to commit to,

14:44.341 --> 14:47.303
and now Ann Marie Fusco.
It’s... it's all gone down the tubes.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.138
You’re trying to blame me
for this, aren’t you?

14:49.346 --> 14:52.099
No, I am just trying to find out
who killed Cindy Clifton

14:52.182 --> 14:54.268
because it wasn’t Leonard Peeler.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.729
Well, I can imagine
what he’s been telling you about this.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.398
Let me guess.
Andy had just gotten his shield,

14:59.523 --> 15:01.609
-and I was running the show, right?
-Nothing like that.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.902
JOE: Were you not there?

15:02.985 --> 15:05.738
Was that a cardboard cutout
of Andy Sipowicz in that room?

15:05.821 --> 15:07.823
-I was there.
-’Cause I'm not holding the bag on this.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.452
Joe, no one's looking to blame anybody.
All we’re asking for is some help.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.455
Well, I can’t provide any.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.292
-But good luck, and I mean that.
-If you think of anything, though...

15:18.417 --> 15:22.379
No, no, I'm not going back there.
You guys can if you want, but...

15:23.547 --> 15:27.426
And this is the last time you come
to my house hittin' on me about that case.

15:29.386 --> 15:30.721
We should get back.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.890
You came here to blame me.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.144
I'm pissed, Joe.
I'm really, really pissed off...

15:38.437 --> 15:39.980
but I'm not blaming you.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.405
(SIGHS)

15:48.489 --> 15:51.408
-So, Mr. Creel...
-Yeah.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.329
Naked in the closet.
You want a chance to explain?

15:55.579 --> 15:57.748
KELLY: Two priors for solicitation
of an undercover officer,

15:57.831 --> 15:59.583
loitering near a pross stroll.

16:00.751 --> 16:04.129
All right, yeah.
So, what? You want the big act?

16:04.797 --> 16:06.799
-What act?
-You know, the one where I tell you

16:06.882 --> 16:10.052
that what I did was wrong,
and... (SIGHS) ...I'll never do it again,

16:10.135 --> 16:12.179
and beg forgiveness, and...

16:12.763 --> 16:16.058
You know what, ladies?
I patronize prostitutes.

16:16.308 --> 16:20.104
I go to women,
I give them money to have sex with me.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.356
Fee paid for service rendered.

16:22.898 --> 16:27.653
And if this country weren’t shackled
to some 19th-century sense of morality,

16:27.778 --> 16:29.196
that’s the way it would be treated.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.199
-Really?
-Yeah. I used to go to bars.

16:32.282 --> 16:37.955
Drinks on me, dinner on me.
Long conversations.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.874
You know what the difference
between going to a hooker

16:40.958 --> 16:44.169
and the scene at the bar is?
Hookers are cheaper.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.755
Plus, I... I don’t have to listen
to someone explain to me

16:46.880 --> 16:49.508
why her boss is an asshole
’cause he won’t give her

16:49.591 --> 16:51.719
more responsibility, and...

16:52.302 --> 16:53.929
So, yeah, I did it.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.432
-Lock me up.
-Oh, you’re damn right

16:56.515 --> 16:58.267
we’re gonna lock you up,
you miserable prick!

16:58.350 --> 17:00.686
The girls in that place were 13.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.106
-You don’t think we know that?
-You didn’t see anybody that age with me.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.233
Every one of those rooms had a padlock
to keep girls in.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.694
Every one of those rooms
had condom wrappers.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.196
The girls in that place were underage
and held against their will!

17:11.572 --> 17:15.075
So drop the whoremonger’s rights crusade,
and tell us who runs the place.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.327
And maybe we’ll let the judge know
you cooperated.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.662
KELLY: Or you keep throwing up
this smoke screen,

17:18.746 --> 17:21.498
then you're on your own.
Sexual assault of a minor.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.125
(GRUNTS)

17:24.835 --> 17:27.296
(SIGHS) Rosa. I don’t know her last name.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.465
Uh...
Sometimes she has young girls around,

17:29.590 --> 17:31.008
but I have nothing to do with them.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.761
-KELLY: Where are we gonna find this Rosa?
-I don’t know.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.139
She... she changes apartments
every few weeks and calls me

17:37.222 --> 17:40.350
with the new locale. So I promise you
I don’t know where she is.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.730
I don’t go for children, I swear.

17:45.689 --> 17:49.234
-I swear!
-Previous locations of the cathouse.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.862
-I...
-And don’t open your mouth again!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.290
I remember a man...

18:04.249 --> 18:05.417
with a gun, and...

18:06.168 --> 18:09.588
I was struggling with him, and...
and the gun went off, and then...

18:10.130 --> 18:11.298
I fell.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.136
-And I remember a woman, uh, screaming.
-You remember what the man looked like?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.680
I can’t see his face, no.

18:19.139 --> 18:22.518
-You see what he’s wearing?
-No, I... It’s too foggy. It’s like...

18:23.060 --> 18:26.355
-I remember it like it was a dream.
-Are you sure it isn’t?

18:27.523 --> 18:28.732
What does that mean?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.901
You’re aware that what you claim
to be suffering from...

18:30.984 --> 18:34.530
full-blown amnesia,
that... that it’s very, very rare.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.240
The neurologist said that.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.784
So you understand
how it makes us look at you?

18:38.992 --> 18:41.537
-Like I'm lying.
-Well, we’ve got to entertain the idea.

18:41.620 --> 18:45.541
Well, I'm not.
I'm not! I mean, hell... I wish I was!

18:46.125 --> 18:50.003
For argument’s sake, if you were,
and you were involved in something

18:50.087 --> 18:52.381
over drugs or money
or... or something else

18:52.589 --> 18:54.466
that you wouldn’t want the police
to know about?

18:54.550 --> 18:56.260
No, I couldn’t be involved in anything
like that.

18:56.343 --> 18:57.594
-Why not?
-TIM: I just...

18:59.429 --> 19:02.141
-I don’t think I could.
-Well, if that was the case,

19:02.307 --> 19:05.811
we could understand how you might not want
to be forthcoming right away.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.271
-You good?
-(SIGHS)

19:07.396 --> 19:10.315
We could forgive the charade
to this point,

19:10.649 --> 19:13.360
but if you keep clinging to it,
it’s gonna mean real trouble.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.530
Like when this is all sorted out,
you’re gonna be doing more time in jail

19:16.613 --> 19:19.658
-just because you lied.
-I'm not lying! I...

19:20.075 --> 19:22.870
I don’t know who I am!
I don’t know who did this to me! I just...

19:22.953 --> 19:25.873
(HESITATES, BREATHES HEAVILY)
...a man shot me.

19:26.707 --> 19:30.794
A woman screamed. I just... I can’t see
their faces clearly, that’s all.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.714
Oh, my head hurts like hell.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.175
-I gotta cut you off.
-We’ll be back.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.553
All right, thanks.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.931
Woman in the building across
from where this guy got picked up

19:43.015 --> 19:45.934
called the squad and said
she might have heard gunshots last night.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.687
Anything more from him?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.481
Rare amnesia or good actor.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.322
You sure you want to do this now?

-You’re not welcome here.
-We just need to talk to him, ma’am.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.502
Talk to him or harass him?

20:12.628 --> 20:15.547
We need a brief conversation
with Leonard, then we’ll leave.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.507
You’re not welcome here.

-Is there someplace we can talk?
-You guys got a lot of nerve.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.354
It’s all right. I'm gonna make this quick.
Then we can get back to celebrating.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.314
'Cause ain’t nobody gonna spoil
this party!

20:32.481 --> 20:33.857
(ALL CHEERING)

20:40.072 --> 20:41.490
Just so you know,

20:41.615 --> 20:44.660
Ann Marie Fusco admitted that you were
with her the night of the murder.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.913
We’ll forward that information
to the DA’s office.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.624
I'm sure they’ll move
for a dismissal as soon as possible.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.543
Why’d she lie? Or do I need to ask?

20:54.211 --> 20:56.588
She was young, scared of her dad.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.675
So she’d rather I go to prison
for 18 years

20:59.883 --> 21:02.177
than let her daddy know
she slept with a Black man?

21:02.261 --> 21:03.804
It’s terrible what she did...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.266
but her lie isn’t just the one thing
that put you away,

21:07.391 --> 21:10.143
-so don’t fixate on her.
-Don’t tell me what to fixate on, okay?

21:10.269 --> 21:13.939
-I don’t need any advice from you!
-Fine. But I'll just tell you

21:14.022 --> 21:16.775
that if you go looking
to settle up with Ann Marie,

21:16.900 --> 21:19.653
-it’s gonna send you backwards.
-I ain’t going near that bitch.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.698
I ain’t doing nothing
to jeopardize my freedom.

21:22.906 --> 21:25.325
Since we’re, uh,
starting from scratch now,

21:25.409 --> 21:27.369
we’re looking for who killed
a 12-year-old girl back then.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.414
is there anything that you can tell us,
assuming you’re in the mood to help?

21:30.497 --> 21:33.583
I don’t know nothing about it.
Didn’t then, don’t now.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.545
Yeah, but Cindy's family said
that they saw you talking to her

21:36.628 --> 21:38.839
an hour before they found her body.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.508
She had a lemonade stand.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.470
On my way to Ann Marie's place,
I stopped and bought a glass.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.807
I had a niece
that used to do lemonade stands.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.602
I knew how it’d make her smile
if folks bought stuff.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.439
My niece is 25 now.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.150
You didn’t notice anyone suspicious
hangin' around Cindy

21:58.233 --> 22:00.319
-or her lemonade stand?
-No.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.948
-All right, then.
-Enjoy your party.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.284
When do I get my apology?

22:08.994 --> 22:11.079
I feel bad for what you went through...

22:11.705 --> 22:16.293
-but we had two witnesses lie.
-You and your partner, Joe Brockhurst,

22:16.501 --> 22:19.463
you got your mitts on me,
and you didn’t look nowhere else,

22:19.546 --> 22:20.756
not for a second!

22:20.964 --> 22:23.800
I did my job.
I got nothing to apologize for.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.556
Yo, Detective?

22:30.557 --> 22:31.975
Let’s say we flip it...

22:32.768 --> 22:35.479
I put you inside, take you away
from your family,

22:35.812 --> 22:37.397
-people you love...
-Mm-hmm.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.483
...stick you in a hole for somethin'
you didn’t do,

22:39.566 --> 22:42.444
and leave you there to rot for 18 years.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.738
How would you feel?

22:46.448 --> 22:48.450
Think I'd owe you an apology?

23:05.509 --> 23:10.138
Honestly, I never heard gunshots before,
so I didn’t know what it was.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.682
Around what time did you hear the noise,
Miss Elspeth?

23:12.766 --> 23:16.186
Mm... 3:00 this morning.
But I thought it was the TV up loud.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.439
Then I heard about the man who was shot,
so I called in.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.902
Did you, uh, hear any kind of fighting
coming from up here last night?

23:23.985 --> 23:27.364
No, when I don’t have the aid in,
only the sharp noises get through.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.242
And, uh, you’re sure you never seen
this guy before?

23:31.034 --> 23:32.452
I don’t know his face.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.496
-What’s his name?
-We’re trying to figure that out.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.207
-Sorry, I had to find my key.
-BALDWIN: All right.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.960

Yeah, he’s John Doe.

what the hell happened here?

No. But time’s up
on Tim Keating's memory lapse.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.631
15th squad to Central K.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.633
OFFICER: (OVER RADIO)
<i>Go ahead, 15th squad.</i>

24:34.431 --> 24:37.559
Hey, uh, the woman running those girls
out of that apartment, Rosa,

24:37.684 --> 24:38.894
vice picked her up. She’s on her way in.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.521
-And the little girl, Corisa?
-Wasn’t with her.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.650
-But gettin' this lady, that’s big.
-Yeah. We’re gonna find that girl.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.614
I talked to Cindy Clifton's parents.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.408
They're too upset right now,
but they might be up for talking later.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.702
In looking at the ME’s reports
on Cindy Clifton,

24:55.785 --> 24:58.163
-there’s no mention of defensive wounds.
-Yeah

24:58.288 --> 25:00.290
It doesn’t look like
she fought off her attacker at all.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.458
She was 12 years old.

25:01.541 --> 25:03.627
Uh... Remember the attempted rape
on that 11-year-old,

25:03.752 --> 25:06.171
-Jennifer Dinardo? She fought like hell.
-Yeah

25:06.254 --> 25:07.923
I'm just saying,
if we’re starting from scratch,

25:08.048 --> 25:10.842
we might want to look at the possibility
that Cindy knew her attacker.

25:11.635 --> 25:14.513
Did you, um, did you guys look down
that road at all back then?

25:14.721 --> 25:17.474
We had Peeler in custody
the same night of the murder.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.935
-He was our guy.
-All right.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.813
Well, Cindy's, uh, best friend back then,
Angela Malcolm,

25:24.022 --> 25:25.690
-she still lives in the city.
-We should call her.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.275
I did. She’s coming in.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.280
-Thanks for helping out on this.
-You’d do the same for me.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.581
-Sit down, Rosa.
-I have done nothing wrong.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.792
(SIGHS) Then why’d you sneak out
of the apartment this morning, huh?

25:44.000 --> 25:45.752
It is wrong to leave an apartment?

25:45.961 --> 25:49.881
Out the fire escape with an underage girl
you kept under lock and key? Yeah.

25:50.048 --> 25:52.008
No one is under lock and key.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.177
I live with girls
who are new to this country.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.638
I give them place to stay
and help them find work. That is all.

25:56.846 --> 25:59.307
When you say work,
you mean sex, prostitution?

25:59.391 --> 26:01.685
-There is none of that.
-We went through that apartment.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.144
We found the condoms.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.814
We talked to one of your customers.
We know what you were doing there.

26:05.939 --> 26:09.818
No, no, no, no. It’s not true.
It is not easy here for a young woman

26:10.026 --> 26:12.737
who doesn’t speak the language.
But no, not that.

26:12.821 --> 26:17.742
We’re already very upset about this.
Lying to us? It only makes us more upset.

26:18.076 --> 26:21.371
If you do it again,
I'm putting you in jail for a long time.

26:21.621 --> 26:22.831
You understand?

26:24.332 --> 26:27.961
The young girl at the apartment, Corisa,
where is she?

26:28.670 --> 26:30.171
-I don’t know.
-RITA: You left with her, didn’t you?

26:30.463 --> 26:32.632
Yes. But I gave her back to the man
who’s in charge.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.883
Who’s he?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.386
I only know his first name, Asberto.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.513
-How do you contact him?
-He contact me.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.723
Where is Corisa?

26:40.390 --> 26:43.685
New apartment. That’s all I know.
That's all they tell me.

26:43.810 --> 26:47.188
-Next apartment to work.
-Write down the address.

26:55.947 --> 26:56.948
Tim Keating...

26:57.699 --> 27:00.076
and this is my address?
I mean, is that current?

27:00.160 --> 27:02.537
Mr. Keating,
this doesn’t jog your memory at all?

27:02.996 --> 27:05.457
(HESITATES)
I mean, I know this is my license.

27:05.540 --> 27:09.169
-I remember seeing it before.
-Jessica Dubinsky, do you know her?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.796
(SIGHS) No.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.632
Well, you got her number
in your cell phone.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.967
She looks familiar, but I...
No, I don’t recognize her.

27:16.051 --> 27:20.889
Mr. Keating, Tim, we’re done
with your confused-little-boy act.

27:20.972 --> 27:21.973
It’s not an act.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.893
-Were you seeing Jessica Dubinsky?
-I don’t know.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.562
Did you go to her apartment
and have an argument?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.230
-I don’t know, I...
-Did you do something to her

27:29.314 --> 27:31.358
-you didn’t mean to?
-Well, like what?

27:35.487 --> 27:36.696
Oh, my God.

27:38.198 --> 27:39.199
Is she dead?

27:39.366 --> 27:42.410
Did you kill your girlfriend
then turn the gun on yourself?

27:42.952 --> 27:44.496
GREG: You understand,
now that we know your name,

27:44.621 --> 27:47.832
we’re gonna be talking to your co-workers
and your family and friends.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.168
And if one of them says
that you were having trouble

27:50.377 --> 27:52.420
with your girlfriend,
you’re under arrest for murder.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.589
-Oh, my God.
-If this is something you planned,

27:54.673 --> 27:56.174
we can help with a reason why,

27:56.341 --> 27:57.967
or if this jumped off
out of an argument...

27:58.051 --> 28:01.137
I don’t remember anything like this,
all right? You gotta believe me!

28:01.471 --> 28:05.517
A beautiful girl shot in the head,
your stuff in her apartment!

28:06.142 --> 28:09.354
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
I don’t recognize that girl.

28:10.313 --> 28:13.358
I don’t remember hurting anyone.
If I did, I'm sorry, but...

28:13.733 --> 28:16.736
-God, I hope I didn’t. I...
-All right, enough.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.823
He doesn’t leave this bed.

28:23.159 --> 28:25.161
-Have a seat, Angela.
-Thanks.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.375
So, that’s crazy
about this whole Leonard Peeler thing.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.627
-Yeah.
-So, he’s not the one who killed Cindy?

28:32.877 --> 28:34.045
Doesn’t look like it, no.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.922
Are you guys gonna get sued now
or something?

28:36.047 --> 28:38.633
(SIGHING) Well, we’re not really concerned
with that right now.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.386
Our main focus is findin'
who did kill Cindy.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.971
You were best friends with her.
Is that right?

28:43.138 --> 28:44.723
Well, yeah, I lived two buildings down.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.600
Okay. One of the things
we’re looking at now is the possibility

28:47.726 --> 28:49.644
that Cindy may have known her attacker.

28:49.769 --> 28:52.021
I can’t believe you guys
have to start all over again...

28:52.147 --> 28:54.816
Well, we are.
And I... I don’t mean to be rude, Angela

28:54.941 --> 28:57.152
but, uh, this whole thing’s been
a little tough on us.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.487
-Right, I understand.
-So if you could just help us out

28:59.571 --> 29:02.198
by answering the questions,
we’d appreciate it.

29:02.323 --> 29:03.324
Okay.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.702
Were there any men back then
who Cindy was afraid of

29:05.827 --> 29:09.414
or who spent a lot of time around her
or were inappropriate with her?

29:09.497 --> 29:10.790
Anything like that you can remember?

29:10.874 --> 29:13.418
She... she had already started to develop,

29:13.501 --> 29:15.795
and she looked a little older
than she was,

29:15.962 --> 29:18.590
and I remember guys
were starting to check her out.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.968
But she never said anything
as far as any guy doing anything.

29:22.093 --> 29:23.553
Was Cindy happy at home?

29:23.636 --> 29:25.722
Was she scared of her dad
or any relatives?

29:25.889 --> 29:27.557
No, she was happy.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.934
I mean, a... as far as I can remember.
This was 18 years ago.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.519
-(CHUCKLES)
-I know that.

29:31.770 --> 29:36.191
You know, the only thing I can think of,
though, was Mr. D'Ambrosio.

29:36.524 --> 29:39.611
Uh... Cindy babysat for them,
and some of the girls in the neighborhood

29:39.694 --> 29:42.906
thought he was cute. And I think Cindy
even said it

29:43.072 --> 29:44.824
-at one point.
-Would he drive her home?

29:44.908 --> 29:46.576
No, no, the D'Ambrosios lived
on the block.

29:46.826 --> 29:49.287
Do you remember
D'Ambrosio's first name?

29:49.746 --> 29:50.914
Pete.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.167
-JOHN: Appreciate your help.
-Well, good luck.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.711
-Thanks.
-JOHN: Thanks.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.382
(SIGHS) We're gonna go hassle a guy

30:01.466 --> 30:04.052
that Cindy Clifton thought was cute
18 years ago?

30:04.260 --> 30:06.387
Gotta start somewhere. Come on.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.779
Amnesia, let me find it.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.034
Cases of complete loss
of memory are extremely rare.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.787
I don’t know if the doctor hipped you
to that or not.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.038
Yeah, she did.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.416
But the, uh, DOA, Jessica Dubinsky,
her ex just showed,

30:35.500 --> 30:38.711
and the DOA’s mom
said that, uh, Jessica and her ex

30:38.795 --> 30:41.422
-had some bad blood since the breakup.
-Oh, really?

30:41.631 --> 30:45.093
Most of my friends said their divorce
was a kick in the pants.

30:46.302 --> 30:48.972
(SIGHS) Either way, we went ahead
and dumped the ex-husband’s phone.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.807
They should be
faxin' over the results soon.

30:50.932 --> 30:53.726
If anything pops regarding Tim Keating,
could you give us a heads-up?

30:53.893 --> 30:56.813
Sure. But you got a uniformed cop
sitting on Keating at the hospital, right?

30:57.063 --> 30:59.816
-Right.
-Good, ’cause if he does have amnesia...

31:01.609 --> 31:03.486
"they may even leave their homes,

31:03.945 --> 31:06.865
"wander for a while,
and start a new life somewhere else."

31:07.198 --> 31:09.742
-There you have it.
-Uh... Thanks, boss.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.003
-Have a seat, Mr. D’ambrosio.
-Pete.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.048
-How do you take your coffee, Pete?
-Uh... A little sugar. Thank you.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.383
(CLEARS THROAT)

31:25.592 --> 31:28.469
We’re investigating Cindy Clifton's rape
and murder.

31:28.636 --> 31:31.222
I saw on the TV about the guy
that was accused of it.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.932
-ANDY: Yeah.
-So, he didn’t do it?

31:33.099 --> 31:35.810
No. Cindy used to babysit for you
and your wife?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.896
-That’s right.
-How long?

31:38.104 --> 31:40.231
Oh, uh, six months or so.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.776
In looking at the case again,
there might have been a possibility

31:43.860 --> 31:45.612
that Cindy knew her attacker.

31:46.487 --> 31:48.948
-What makes you think that?
-Evidence we have.

31:49.866 --> 31:50.867
I see.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.952
Looking back now
and keeping that aspect in mind,

31:53.036 --> 31:54.746
does anything jump out at you?

31:56.164 --> 31:57.665
-Yes.
-Go ahead.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.752
In the weeks before Cindy was killed...

32:02.045 --> 32:03.880
she never wanted to leave our house.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.508
When me and my wife came back,
Cindy would offer to do chores

32:07.634 --> 32:09.636
or ask if she could watch TV

32:09.719 --> 32:12.055
or she’d say she was sleepy,
could she stay at our place.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.806
Did you ever ask her about it?

32:13.890 --> 32:17.769
Once. I was walkin' her home one night.
It’s, um, just down the block.

32:18.019 --> 32:21.439
And she was literally dragging her feet.

32:21.522 --> 32:24.317
So I asked her,
"Is everything all right at home?"

32:25.109 --> 32:30.281
And she didn’t answer me.
But I had a really bad feeling, you know?

32:30.365 --> 32:33.910
I mean, deep in my gut,
that there was something wrong.

32:34.285 --> 32:36.412
Why didn’t you bring this up
when she was killed?

32:36.829 --> 32:40.375
That Black guy was in custody.
He was the one that you guys said did it,

32:40.458 --> 32:43.169
and nobody from the police department
ever came by to talk to me.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.837
-Yeah.
-JOHN: Pete,

32:44.963 --> 32:47.340
I don’t want you to take offense to this
’cause it’s a standard question

32:47.423 --> 32:49.175
-we're asking people.
-PETE: Okay

32:49.342 --> 32:51.970
We’re not gonna find out that you had
an inappropriate relationship

32:52.095 --> 32:53.304
with Cindy, are we?

32:53.638 --> 32:56.432
Because the time to talk about that
would be now.

32:56.933 --> 32:59.435
I never laid a hand on that girl.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.230
Okay, then.

33:03.314 --> 33:06.651
-Is that all?
-Yeah. We appreciate your help.

33:20.039 --> 33:22.041
-I'll get this to the lab.
-Yeah...

33:22.166 --> 33:24.919
-We need to get the dad in here too.
-JOHN: Yeah.

33:27.088 --> 33:28.756
I'm really shocked.

33:29.632 --> 33:31.092
I saw Jess two days ago.

33:31.968 --> 33:35.221
-This is such a blow.
-Saw her where, Mr. Dubinsky?

33:36.305 --> 33:39.100
-Uh... We met for lunch.
-About somethin' specific?

33:39.308 --> 33:43.062
-Just to shoot the breeze.
-Speaking from experience, Mr. Dubinsky,

33:43.146 --> 33:46.357
uh, that’s an odd relationship to have
with an ex-wife.

33:46.441 --> 33:50.361
Well, Jess and I were moving on.
We realized we had a lot in common...

33:50.695 --> 33:52.780
we just weren’t any good at being married.

33:53.072 --> 33:56.534
-So no interest in reconciling?
-No, we were better off as friends.

33:56.617 --> 33:57.869
The reason we brought you in

33:57.952 --> 34:00.747
is because Jessica's mom said
the divorce had been nasty,

34:00.830 --> 34:02.749
and it was still nasty between you.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.877
In our wedding photos,
her mom's the one with the scowl.

34:06.085 --> 34:09.839
She never liked me,
so I... I wouldn’t trust her word.

34:10.173 --> 34:13.342
Yeah, well, can you account for yourself
this morning, 3 a.m.?

34:13.551 --> 34:15.762
Well, I was in bed, alone.

34:17.180 --> 34:22.018
The doorman can tell you if I left or not.
I mean... You think I'm involved in this?

34:22.101 --> 34:25.271
I said it’s, uh, standard procedure
to look at loved ones,

34:25.521 --> 34:28.191
-present and former.
-Well, do I need an attorney?

34:28.316 --> 34:31.319
I mean, not because I did anything,
but just to be safe?

34:31.402 --> 34:35.364
If you can get us to the killer, uh,
we’d rather not deal with the hassle.

34:35.490 --> 34:38.993
Like, uh, do you know of any other men
in her life, a boyfriend?

34:39.077 --> 34:41.287
Yeah, she was seeing a guy
named Tim Keating.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.665
-Have you talked to him about this?
-Well, he’s on our list.

34:44.957 --> 34:48.252
Because she wasn’t very happy
in the relationship.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.798
-Did she say why?
-She said he was doing coke, cocaine

34:52.006 --> 34:54.342
and, uh, one time she overheard
this phone conversation

34:54.425 --> 34:58.387
this Tim was having with what sounded
like a pretty angry coke dealer.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.014
Like, that he owed money to?

35:00.098 --> 35:03.142
She wasn’t specific,
but she was scared by it.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.354
God.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.315
Why didn’t I do something about it then?

35:09.524 --> 35:10.566
(DOOR KNOCKING)

35:12.193 --> 35:13.319
Excuse us.

35:20.618 --> 35:23.204
You ask him if he had any association
with the John Doe?

35:23.412 --> 35:25.706
-He knew of him.
-Dump came back on his cell.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.084
Ten calls to John Doe’s place of work.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.128
This guy playin' us,
puttin' out coke dealer theories?

35:30.378 --> 35:32.505
-Ain’t that a question for him?
-GREG: He’s hinky.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.674
If he knows we dumped his phone,
he’ll lawyer up.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.051
Or confess. Your call.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.730
Locked door here.

35:50.439 --> 35:52.066

35:59.157 --> 36:01.909

36:18.384 --> 36:21.095
-They left her.
-Does she know the other girl, Corisa?

-(SOBS)

36:41.073 --> 36:44.619
I’m a little nervous. Uh...
I've never had to identify a body before.

36:45.244 --> 36:48.998
They lift the sheet.
If it’s Jessica, you say so. That’s it.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.419
Look, I... I gotta admit,
my nerves are compounded by guilt

36:53.502 --> 36:55.671
for not doing anything
about this Tim Keating.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.424
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I mean, thinking back...

36:59.175 --> 37:02.428
she was scared of the guy.
You haven’t located him?

37:03.012 --> 37:06.349
-Uh... We did, Mr. Dubinsky.
-Uh... He was shot along with Jessica.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.935
Oh, man.

37:09.810 --> 37:12.605
-Look, you gotta find the cocaine dealer.
-Yeah.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.447
-That’s him! That’s who shot me!
-You son of a bitch!

37:21.530 --> 37:23.449
Calm down, Tim! Get him out of here!

37:26.953 --> 37:28.496
We got something to talk about?

37:28.621 --> 37:31.582
You didn’t kill him, Mr. Dubinsky.
He just identified you.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.376
So you got something to say,
or you just gonna sit there

37:33.459 --> 37:35.127
working your mouth like a dyin' fish?

37:35.211 --> 37:37.171
-How?
-GREG: A miracle.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.423
So, why’d you shoot your ex-wife
and Tim Keating?

37:39.507 --> 37:43.135
-How did I not kill him? I...
-Mr. Dubinsky, it’s time to focus.

37:44.136 --> 37:47.807
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
He was screwing the woman that I love.

37:48.474 --> 37:49.850
I couldn’t live with that.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.731
I'll get him to the house. Come on.

38:02.571 --> 38:03.739
(SIGHS)

38:12.540 --> 38:15.751
-So, how’d it go? Is he the guy?
-Yeah, he gave it right up.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.254
-(SIGHS)
-You did great.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.423
Why did he shoot me and Jessica?

38:21.382 --> 38:22.758
He said he was jealous.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.136
He saw the two of you together,
and he lost it.

38:28.889 --> 38:30.391
Any of this coming back to you?

38:32.143 --> 38:35.229
It’s starting to, you know,
like, it’s familiar.

38:36.605 --> 38:38.441
What I'm afraid of now
is how bad it’s gonna hurt

38:38.524 --> 38:40.151
when it really does come back to me...

38:43.362 --> 38:45.364
’cause I'm getting the sense
I loved this girl.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.079
Get some rest, Mr. Keating.
I'll be in touch.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.342
All right. Thanks.

39:06.635 --> 39:10.264
So, the second girl we found, Anna,
social services has her.

39:10.389 --> 39:14.185
They, uh, contacted a charity organization
that returns stolen kids to their parents,

39:14.268 --> 39:17.605
-and they’re gonna take the case.
-What about the madame, this Rosa lady?

39:17.772 --> 39:20.399
Collared for promoting prostitution
and child endangerment.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.194
And we ran the name
she gave us past vice, Asberto.

39:23.486 --> 39:26.572
They know him, but he’s only a step
above her, still small-time.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.824
-They’re looking for him now.
-And Corisa?

39:29.575 --> 39:30.743
In the wind.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.120
One girl’s safe. That’s somethin', right?

39:34.663 --> 39:35.664
Good work.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.542
-Everything going all right?
-Yeah.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.003
I'll assume your case is proceeding
and you’ll tell me about it

39:41.087 --> 39:43.964
-when it’s necessary?
-Yeah. Thanks, Gibson.

39:44.131 --> 39:45.883
Okay, then. Good night.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.218
Good night, Sarge.

39:52.681 --> 39:54.308
ANDY:
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Clifton.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.936
Why don’t we grab a cup of coffee?

40:09.031 --> 40:12.410
Is there a reason why you requested
I come alone, without my wife?

40:12.535 --> 40:15.037
We’ll be talking with everybody,
but individually.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.747
I'm having some coffee, Mr. Clifton.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.874
-Care for some?
-No, thank you.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.960
-Water, soda, anything?
-GERALD: No.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.504
Can we just please get to it?

40:23.796 --> 40:25.506
ANDY: We’re starting over, as you know,

40:26.090 --> 40:29.677
and one of the things that we discovered
or rediscovered, I guess,

40:30.136 --> 40:32.805
is that Cindy didn’t have
any defensive wounds.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.266
Meaning it doesn’t look like
she fought off her assailant,

40:35.349 --> 40:36.809
-which means...
-If you guys plan on getting

40:36.892 --> 40:39.645
into the specifics of how my daughter
was raped and killed,

40:39.728 --> 40:42.773
I can tell you right now,
I will absolutely not sit here

40:42.857 --> 40:44.608
and have those wounds reopened again.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.445
We’re sympathetic, but we also need
to find out who killed Cindy.

40:47.528 --> 40:48.779
I understand.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.573
But I want you to be damn careful

40:50.656 --> 40:53.075
what you say around me
and especially my wife

40:53.242 --> 40:55.995
when it comes to the details
of how our daughter was killed.

40:56.078 --> 40:57.121
That’s fine.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.748
We believe Cindy
may have known her assailant.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.626
Does anyone come to mind
who could have had, uh,

41:02.710 --> 41:04.587
an inappropriate relationship with her?

41:04.670 --> 41:09.133
(SCOFFS) If there was, I wouldn’t have
waited 18 years to tell you about it!

41:11.177 --> 41:13.345
-Are we done?
-ANDY: Uh... One more thing...

41:13.429 --> 41:15.931
(CLEARING THROAT) ...and we’re gonna be
asking this of everybody.

41:16.015 --> 41:18.684
Since DNA was recovered
from Cindy's clothing,

41:18.767 --> 41:20.811
we’re gonna need a DNA sample from you

41:20.895 --> 41:23.397
so that you can be eliminated
as a suspect.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.691
We’re sorry, but it needs to happen.

41:26.692 --> 41:29.487
-You must be out of your mind!
-It’s standard procedure, sir.

41:29.695 --> 41:31.489
Well, what do you know
about standard procedure?

41:31.572 --> 41:33.282
You put the wrong guy in jail

41:33.365 --> 41:35.367
-for 18 years!
-You know what, Mr. Clifton?

41:35.451 --> 41:37.328
Let’s make ourselves a deal here.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.747
We’ll be careful about the details
about your daughter’s death

41:39.830 --> 41:41.040
if you stay careful

41:41.123 --> 41:45.085
about how my partner investigated
the case. Two witnesses lied.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.380
That is not the New York City
police department’s fault.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.466
I have no faith in you or your department.

41:50.591 --> 41:52.968
And if you have any more questions
for me or my family,

41:53.052 --> 41:54.887
you can contact our attorney!

42:03.812 --> 42:05.773
How did I miss all this back then?
