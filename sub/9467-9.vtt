00:01.634 --> 00:01.835
.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.212
'...a bit.'

00:12.212 --> 00:15.048
'Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:15.048 --> 00:18.385
the show that brings you
genuine stories from history...

00:18.385 --> 00:21.654
...as told by blind drunk comedians.
Oh, shit.

00:21.654 --> 00:24.557
If you enjoyed school,
but your teacher didn't spend

00:24.557 --> 00:28.027
enough time chucking up in a bucket,
this is the show for you.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.929
"Lads, lads, lads, lads, lads."

00:29.929 --> 00:32.064
"Now I've got no depth perception."

00:32.064 --> 00:34.367
"I'm gonna get vengeance."

00:34.367 --> 00:38.304
"I am terribly poorly
in my woman's parts."

00:39.672 --> 00:43.543
I don't know what my genitals are
doing. They've been dead for years.

00:54.087 --> 00:57.157
'First up we're learning
about the Battle of Hastings.'

00:57.157 --> 01:00.560
'We could either A, study
the awe inspiring Bayeux Tapestry,

01:00.560 --> 01:04.197
or B, get Nick Helm smashed
out of his chubby little skull

01:04.197 --> 01:07.066
and ask him to tell us about it.
We went for option B.'

01:07.066 --> 01:08.668
(laughs)

01:08.668 --> 01:10.770
'Here he is
after six bottles of beer,

01:10.770 --> 01:14.974
three quarters of a bottle of
Amaretto and two double vodka sodas.'

01:16.176 --> 01:18.611
Hello. Hello.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.448
I mean... Hello, everybody.

01:21.448 --> 01:22.949
My name's Nick Helm.

01:22.949 --> 01:27.654
Welcome to my historical world.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.889
(toots)

01:29.889 --> 01:34.594
So, today I will be
talking you through, er,

01:34.594 --> 01:37.030
the Battle of Hastings.

01:37.964 --> 01:40.533
It starts in 1064.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.336
Harold Godwinson
is this Earl or something

01:43.336 --> 01:46.973
and he's like a member of the
British aristocracy, and he is...

01:46.973 --> 01:50.677
He's proper good, and he's friends
with William the Bastard.

01:52.912 --> 01:56.449
Right, now William the Bastard
is called William the Bastard

01:56.449 --> 02:00.453
because when he was conceived, his
parents weren't married, you know?

02:00.453 --> 02:03.189
But on top of that, he's a cunt.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.525
He ripped a man's tongue
out of his head

02:05.525 --> 02:08.127
and nailed it to his front door,
right?

02:08.127 --> 02:11.631
That's how much of... That's
how much of a cunt he is, right?

02:11.631 --> 02:16.636
Now, this is where
it gets interesting.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.873
So, like, French, French and English

02:19.873 --> 02:22.642
for years have, like,
had a timeshare deal

02:22.642 --> 02:25.345
where the king of one
has been the king of the other.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.747
When he's died,
the other one's come over.

02:27.747 --> 02:30.850
Harold said "Hey,
if you want to be king at any point,

02:30.850 --> 02:34.087
"I am gonna support you.
I think that you'd be a good king."

02:34.087 --> 02:37.323
"I think that's a good choice.
I think that's brilliant."

02:37.323 --> 02:38.958
So, skip forward a few years

02:38.958 --> 02:43.162
and the King of England, Edward
the Confessor, he just dies, right?

02:43.162 --> 02:46.833
And Harold turns around and goes,
"Fetch me my quill and parchment."

02:46.833 --> 02:49.235
"I'd better write
to William the Bastard

02:49.235 --> 02:51.871
and tell him that it's his turn
to be king now."

02:51.871 --> 02:53.506
(groans)

02:53.506 --> 02:57.343
"Always the... Always the
bridesmaid, never the bride."

02:57.343 --> 03:01.414
"Hang on a minute.
Why, the dress is just there."

03:01.414 --> 03:04.183
"Why don't I try it on for a while?"

03:04.183 --> 03:07.120
And he does. He just whacks it on,

03:07.120 --> 03:11.724
and he goes "I actually
quite like being king. Yep."

03:11.724 --> 03:17.597
Quick as a puddle, Harold
the fucking greatest... Godwinson.

03:17.597 --> 03:20.567
Harold Godwinson is king,
which is great.

03:20.567 --> 03:23.903
Everyone's really happy about that,
until, of course,

03:23.903 --> 03:29.309
William the Bastard finds out
that he was been usurped.

03:29.309 --> 03:32.845
Typically, he reacted badly to it.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.048
"Oh, mais oui!"

03:35.048 --> 03:40.653
"I'm gonna fuck
that canard with my little hand!"

03:40.653 --> 03:43.723
You know, like,
he proper Scarface's it, you know?

03:43.723 --> 03:47.760
And everyone's like, "Bloody hell,
I've not heard that accent before."

03:48.728 --> 03:52.465
(blows raspberry) So, erm...

03:52.465 --> 03:56.135
I mean, it's just...
(sighs) What is the point?

03:58.671 --> 04:03.509
I would argue if you didn't know
all of this already,

04:03.509 --> 04:05.912
I'm not the person to tell you.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.648
(producer laughs)

04:08.648 --> 04:11.351
So, Will... William the Bastard,

04:11.351 --> 04:16.856
he goes from Normandy Beach
to fucking Hastings... Beach.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.091
And everyone started going like,

04:19.091 --> 04:22.395
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, lads, lads, lads, lads, lads."

04:22.395 --> 04:27.233
And William falls over and lands on
his face on the fucking sand.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.002
He's just like... (gasps)

04:31.004 --> 04:32.472
"Whoa."

04:33.606 --> 04:36.809
"Looks like I've got a bit of
England in my hand already."

04:36.809 --> 04:38.111
(laughs)

04:38.111 --> 04:42.649
Everyone goes "Bloody hell.
I thought he was a bit of a prick,

04:42.649 --> 04:45.785
but in actual fact
he's got some classic bants."

04:45.785 --> 04:49.389
And they all just went,
"I would die for you."

04:51.724 --> 04:53.593
And a lot of them did.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.597
Meanwhile, Harold,
as soon as he became king,

04:57.597 --> 04:59.999
he started picking fights
with everyone.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.602
So, he was having fights
with the Norwegians.

05:02.602 --> 05:06.105
He was up near Scotland, and then
he'd finished fighting there

05:06.105 --> 05:09.175
and him and his army
were absolutely fucking exhausted.

05:09.175 --> 05:13.046
They'd been run ragged, and he goes,
"Well, it's fucking brilliant."

05:13.046 --> 05:15.548
"We've just finished
that fight with Norway

05:15.548 --> 05:18.284
and I feel fucking great.
I feel really good."

05:18.284 --> 05:20.286
"Do you know what we deserve, lads?"

05:20.286 --> 05:22.355
"We deserve a sit down
and a cup of tea."

05:22.355 --> 05:24.791
Some cunt broke the news to him

05:24.791 --> 05:27.760
that he's got to fucking fight
the battle downstairs.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.196
And Harold said "All right, lads,

05:30.196 --> 05:32.865
I know we've just finished
with the Norwegians."

05:32.865 --> 05:34.734
(sighs) "I've got some bad news."

05:34.734 --> 05:38.071
"We've got a three-week hike
back down to a little place

05:38.071 --> 05:39.772
that I like to call Hastings."

05:41.207 --> 05:44.744
So, by the time they got down
to fucking Hastings,

05:44.744 --> 05:49.482
they went, "We are fucking
exhausted, aren't we, lads?"

05:49.482 --> 05:51.951
They were like,
"Yeah, we're all exhausted."

05:51.951 --> 05:56.355
And Harold said, "Could everybody,
just cos you like me,

05:56.355 --> 05:58.958
pull your socks up real tall,
up to the knees,

05:58.958 --> 06:01.427
maybe beyond, up to the thighs."

06:01.427 --> 06:06.065
"Can we all just pretend
to be a tortoise together?"

06:06.065 --> 06:09.469
And they went, "Is it when we
put our shields above our heads

06:09.469 --> 06:11.804
like in a square
like the Romans did?"

06:11.804 --> 06:13.773
He went, "It's exactly like that."

06:13.773 --> 06:17.310
They did that and he went,
like, "Oh, er, brilliant."

06:17.310 --> 06:19.545
"We're probably gonna nail this."

06:19.545 --> 06:22.815
"Plus, we're at the top of a hill
and they're down below us

06:22.815 --> 06:26.753
and we could probably just like,
kill the living shit out of them."

06:27.754 --> 06:30.823
Basically what happened
was there was a bunch of cunts

06:30.823 --> 06:32.925
that were hiding
at the top of a hill.

06:32.925 --> 06:37.130
And there were a bunch of the Norman
invaders at the bottom of the hill.

06:37.130 --> 06:41.334
So, William the Bastard, he goes
"Taillefer, you're my best mate."

06:41.334 --> 06:45.004
"You've got a guitar. Why don't you
go up there, sing them a song."

06:45.004 --> 06:48.474
So Taillefer, he went out
with his guitar and he did a song.

06:48.474 --> 06:52.044
It was one of the most beautiful
things that's ever been recorded.

06:52.044 --> 06:55.314
You can picture it,
all of the Brits, they loved it

06:55.314 --> 07:00.386
and for a moment it was...
It was like peace on earth.

07:00.386 --> 07:03.356
It was like,
"Let's put aside our differences."

07:03.356 --> 07:07.293
"I'm sorry I said that you could
be king and then I fucked you over."

07:07.293 --> 07:10.630
And he was just like, "I'm sorry
that I overreacted so much,

07:10.630 --> 07:13.666
but of course, if I'd been offered
the chance to be king,

07:13.666 --> 07:17.003
I'd have taken it." And Taillefer,
all of a sudden he goes...

07:17.003 --> 07:19.705
Fucking ploughed it
into some guy's head, right?

07:19.705 --> 07:24.510
And then they got smashed
the shit out of by the Brits.

07:24.510 --> 07:28.681
It's a bloodbath, which is where the
phrase "bloodbath" came from, right?

07:28.681 --> 07:32.752
The Norman invaders went, "Let's
turn around and get down the hill."

07:32.752 --> 07:35.321
Harold said,
"Oi! I was talking to you."

07:35.321 --> 07:39.759
They all turned around and Bonkon
put an arrow in Harold's eye,

07:39.759 --> 07:42.295
and Harold,
he was just like, "What?!"

07:42.295 --> 07:46.933
"I was using that, right.
You know, to see."

07:46.933 --> 07:49.669
"But I've now got
no depth perception."

07:49.669 --> 07:51.304
"I'm not happy about this."

07:51.304 --> 07:56.175
So Harold... Harold! He grabbed
hold of his fucking arrow,

07:56.175 --> 08:02.014
he yanked it right out, and it had
his eye on the end of the arrow,

08:02.014 --> 08:04.483
and there was a Norman
that saw him do that,

08:04.483 --> 08:07.954
and he saw that he saw, and he saw
that that guy was just like going,

08:07.954 --> 08:11.023
"Oh, my God. I can't believe
I've just seen that."

08:11.023 --> 08:15.494
Harold, he saw that,
and so just sneakily Harold ate it.

08:15.494 --> 08:18.264
(laughs)

08:20.967 --> 08:26.005
And Harold's like, "Fuck you,
you Normandy cunts!" Right?

08:26.005 --> 08:30.476
Harold was fighting with one eye,
by which point somebody came along

08:30.476 --> 08:34.013
and he stabbed Harold
in the fucking heart, right?

08:34.013 --> 08:36.215
He stabbed him in the heart, right?

08:36.215 --> 08:39.552
By which point, like,
William the Bastard is like,

08:39.552 --> 08:43.522
"Fucking hell, I absolutely
respect everything about you, right?

08:43.522 --> 08:45.992
"I thought
this was gonna be an easy one."

08:45.992 --> 08:49.362
"I thought we'd get here,
party in Hastings for three weeks,

08:49.362 --> 08:52.198
you'd do all the heavy lifting
by walking that far."

08:52.198 --> 08:56.002
"In actual fact, I think that...
I think the only natural thing to do

08:56.002 --> 09:00.640
is for all of us to just...
surrender."

09:00.640 --> 09:02.775
And Harold was like, "Really?"

09:02.775 --> 09:06.512
"No, mate! You died
when we stabbed you in the heart."

09:06.512 --> 09:08.748
"All of this
is just your death dream."

09:08.748 --> 09:11.984
"You're dead, mate.
You're maggot shit."

09:14.086 --> 09:15.855
That's actually how it happened

09:15.855 --> 09:18.724
and you can check that
on the Bayeux Tapestry.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.761
And so they chopped him
into lots of little pieces.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.931
They chopped his, like,
every single fucking toe off,

09:24.931 --> 09:27.333
and they chopped him off
at the ankle,

09:27.333 --> 09:29.402
and they chopped him off
at the shin.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.003
Chopped his fucking head off

09:31.003 --> 09:35.107
and they spread him along
the entire battlefield, right?

09:35.107 --> 09:37.443
And... (laughs)

09:38.945 --> 09:41.113
And... Oh.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.449
So, they spread him out everywhere,

09:43.449 --> 09:48.054
and, basically, William the Bastard,

09:48.054 --> 09:51.324
he went from fucking Hastings
to Sussex to Kent

09:51.324 --> 09:53.926
and he killed everything
that fucking moved.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.895
He killed everything, right?

09:55.895 --> 09:57.797
And on Christmas Day that year,

09:57.797 --> 10:00.333
as a nice little
Christmas present to himself,

10:00.333 --> 10:03.002
he christened himself William...

10:03.002 --> 10:05.404
"Not William the Bastard, yeah?"

10:05.404 --> 10:07.673
"William the Conqueror, yeah?"

10:07.673 --> 10:10.943
Because he'd basically conquered
the entire of England.

10:10.943 --> 10:15.915
Later that year, he went on
to win the Academy Award, right,

10:15.915 --> 10:20.186
for best actor, director
and screenwriter, right?

10:20.186 --> 10:23.456
And he was the first person
to ever get the Holy Trinity.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.393
And if you write that in your GCSEs,
you'll probably get an A.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.431
(laughter)

10:32.431 --> 10:36.002
'I got an arrow in my eye once
after a battle with some Frenchmen.'

10:36.002 --> 10:39.038
'Well, it wasn't a battle,
but I was surrounded by men.'

10:39.038 --> 10:41.707
'And it wasn't an arrow either,
but it did sting.'

10:41.707 --> 10:45.511
'Join us after the ads for Baby Spice
as you've never seen her before.'

10:45.511 --> 10:49.648
I am terribly poorly
in my woman's parts.

10:51.984 --> 10:52.184
.

10:54.720 --> 10:54.920
.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.990
'Welcome back to Drunk History.'

10:57.990 --> 11:01.293
'We're learning about the
stupid shit comedians come up with

11:01.293 --> 11:03.496
when they're off their tits
on Amaretto,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.665
and that is broadcasting
at its best.'

11:06.665 --> 11:10.569
'Our second tale tonight once again
surrounds Henry VIII's love life.'

11:10.569 --> 11:12.405
'Old Henry was ahead of his time.'

11:12.405 --> 11:15.207
'He was swiping left and right
way back in 1536.'

11:15.207 --> 11:17.209
'Usually with an axe.'

11:17.209 --> 11:20.413
'Here's Sara Pascoe
with the story of wife number six

11:20.413 --> 11:23.749
after seven glasses of Prosecco.
That's nearly two bottles.'

11:23.749 --> 11:26.485
Or when Sara looked at them,
four bottles.'

11:26.485 --> 11:29.255
It's the 16th Century.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.791
Henry VIII has had five wives.

11:31.791 --> 11:34.894
Divorced, beheaded, died.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.896
Divorced, beheaded...

11:38.597 --> 11:41.534
Let me tell you the story
of Catherine Parr.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.604
Right, so where are we?
1543. Henry VIII.

11:45.604 --> 11:50.609
He's this syphilitic, ulcerated,
ginger man with skin falling off.

11:50.609 --> 11:54.613
Everyone's like, "He smells bad but
we can't tell him cos he's king."

11:54.613 --> 11:58.951
He's not had a wife for two years.
He's had five. What's he gonna do?

11:58.951 --> 12:00.586
Henry looks in the mirror

12:00.586 --> 12:04.423
and is like, "Oh, I used to
really have it going on,

12:04.423 --> 12:07.827
and I feel like nowadays a lot
of these women around the court

12:07.827 --> 12:09.695
are running away from me now."

12:09.695 --> 12:12.565
His manservant's like,
"Henry, you're an idiot."

12:12.565 --> 12:16.936
"You're a buffoon. You're the most
handsome man in the region."

12:16.936 --> 12:20.106
"They're all chatting,
who's gonna be wife number six."

12:20.106 --> 12:22.708
Henry's like,
"That's very disrespectful."

12:22.708 --> 12:26.245
"I might not get married again"
And he's like "Mmm..."

12:26.245 --> 12:29.682
And then Henry's like,
"Yeah, I'm gonna get married again."

12:29.682 --> 12:31.684
"How does my junk look in these?"

12:31.684 --> 12:34.787
And the servant's like,
"Incredible."

12:34.787 --> 12:37.990
"You'd never know you had syphilis."

12:37.990 --> 12:40.759
And then Henry swaggers out
into the courtyard,

12:40.759 --> 12:43.629
which is where all the women
stand around in corners

12:43.629 --> 12:47.066
like it's a school disco,
and one catches his eye.

12:47.066 --> 12:50.136
He says to his friend
"Who is that woman?"

12:50.136 --> 12:53.172
And his friend is like,
"That's Catherine Parr."

12:53.172 --> 12:55.574
"She's totally into Thomas Seymour."

12:55.574 --> 12:57.943
"I wouldn't bother.
Out of your league."

12:57.943 --> 13:02.281
Henry VIII is like,
"No-one is out of my league!"

13:02.281 --> 13:04.884
But Catherine Parr
is just not interested.

13:04.884 --> 13:08.888
She's talking to Thomas Seymour
and he looks beautiful tonight.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.556
Thomas Seymour is saying,

13:10.556 --> 13:13.826
"Did you know that some people think
that the earth is round?"

13:13.826 --> 13:15.161
And she's like, "What?"

13:15.161 --> 13:17.630
Henry VIII coughs really loud.
(coughs)

13:17.630 --> 13:20.432
Catherine turns round
and she says, "Hello."

13:20.432 --> 13:23.569
And Henry says,
"Hi. Will you marry me?"

13:23.569 --> 13:26.672
"That's a rhetorical question.
You've got no choice."

13:26.672 --> 13:29.575
There's a vicar there
and Catherine goes, "What?"

13:29.575 --> 13:33.345
And the vicar says,
"I now pronounce you man and wife."

13:33.345 --> 13:36.549
And Henry's like,
"Well, you know the rhyme."

13:36.549 --> 13:38.984
"Divorced, beheaded, died."

13:38.984 --> 13:43.122
"Divorced, beheaded... Hmm?
It's up to you."

13:43.122 --> 13:46.192
And Catherine goes,
"OK. I'll do my best."

13:46.192 --> 13:47.726
And Henry goes, "I hope so,

13:47.726 --> 13:49.895
cos I dunno what
my genitals are doing."

13:49.895 --> 13:51.864
"They've been dead for years."

13:53.132 --> 13:56.001
I'm... I'm completely hammered.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.704
(laughs) But fine.

13:58.704 --> 14:02.208
Now she has to live with the king,
which is bad in some ways

14:02.208 --> 14:05.044
because he's an awful tyrant
who kills his wives,

14:05.044 --> 14:06.345
but good in other ways

14:06.345 --> 14:09.415
because now she's the most
powerful woman in the country

14:09.415 --> 14:12.718
and she gets to live in a castle.
So it's comme ci, comme ca.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.720
Everything's going pretty well,

14:14.720 --> 14:19.191
but then she gets into
evangelical Protestantism.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.727
Like a member of bible club
where she was like,

14:21.727 --> 14:23.362
"Have you read this chapter?"

14:23.362 --> 14:26.198
And they were like,
"Yeah, the chapter with the ark."

14:26.198 --> 14:28.067
"That is a good chapter."

14:28.067 --> 14:32.638
Catherine's getting all ideas
and arrogant like, "Oh, hang on."

14:32.638 --> 14:34.573
"Religion is there for everyone."

14:34.573 --> 14:37.076
"The bible is written by God
via human beings."

14:37.076 --> 14:38.611
"We should all interpret it

14:38.611 --> 14:41.647
and have whatever relationship
with it that we want to."

14:41.647 --> 14:44.750
The King's Counsel were like,
"Hang on. Excuse me."

14:44.750 --> 14:46.652
"Can you shut your mouth,

14:46.652 --> 14:50.122
because actually Henry is the person
who knows about God."

14:50.122 --> 14:52.091
"That book is too complicated."

14:52.091 --> 14:54.393
"No-one should be doing this
at home."

14:54.393 --> 14:57.496
The King's Counsel were like,
"Henry, we're so sorry."

14:57.496 --> 15:01.200
"Your wife is telling everyone
that they can just read the bible

15:01.200 --> 15:04.303
and commune with God themselves.
This is absolute BS."

15:04.303 --> 15:07.039
And Henry VIII is like, "What?!"

15:07.039 --> 15:10.943
And Henry knows something
has to be done about his wife.

15:10.943 --> 15:14.446
He's like,
"I'm gonna get vengeance."

15:14.446 --> 15:17.349
All the king's men
have run off to plan

15:17.349 --> 15:20.352
how they might arrest
the Queen of England,

15:20.352 --> 15:23.856
and Henry is lying there
and he's in terrible pain.

15:25.624 --> 15:27.960
He calls for Dr Wendy.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.631
"Dr Thomas Wendy.
I won't see anybody else."

15:32.631 --> 15:36.802
He gets there and he's like, "Henry,
what on earth is wrong with you?"

15:36.802 --> 15:41.307
And Henry's like, "Everything. I'm
in so much pain. I'm so swollen."

15:41.307 --> 15:44.943
Dr Wendy's like, "If you hadn't
slept with all those prostitutes,

15:44.943 --> 15:47.279
we wouldn't have
this syphilis problem"

15:47.279 --> 15:51.150
Henry VIII is like, "What?"
"Nothing. I was just coughing."

15:51.150 --> 15:54.720
And then Dr Wendy says, "Tell me
what's really bothering you?"

15:54.720 --> 15:58.524
And Henry VIII says, "I think that
I'm gonna get my wife arrested

15:58.524 --> 16:03.595
cos she's saying that I'm not
the absolute Head of the Church."

16:03.595 --> 16:06.799
Dr Wendy is like,
"Your wife is a wonderful woman,

16:06.799 --> 16:09.068
doing incredible things
for the country,

16:09.068 --> 16:11.670
but you're the king.
You can do what you like."

16:11.670 --> 16:15.674
"I just think that maybe I should
have a copy of that arrest warrant."

16:15.674 --> 16:19.078
Henry's like, "That seems
out of the blue, out of nowhere."

16:19.078 --> 16:21.480
"No, it doesn't.
You're just very sick."

16:21.480 --> 16:24.983
And Henry's like "Oh, OK."
Of course you can have that."

16:24.983 --> 16:27.953
So Henry VIII gives him
a copy of the arrest warrant

16:27.953 --> 16:32.791
and Dr Wendy says, "I promise
I will never tell anybody directly

16:32.791 --> 16:35.327
what you have told me in this room."

16:36.729 --> 16:39.264
Dr Wendy knows
exactly what he needs to do,

16:39.264 --> 16:43.335
which is to never ever
break his word to the King VIII.

16:43.335 --> 16:48.841
He walks along the corridor and he
allows the arrest warrant to drop,

16:48.841 --> 16:52.511
coincidentally just outside
Catherine Parr's room.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.514
Catherine has just finished
Protestant Club,

16:55.514 --> 17:00.119
so she's looking forward to putting
on her pyjamas, going to bed...

17:00.119 --> 17:02.921
"What's this on the floor?"

17:02.921 --> 17:06.090
It's got her name on it, so
it wouldn't be rude to read, and...

17:07.291 --> 17:10.596
"Oh. It's an arrest warrant."

17:10.596 --> 17:14.465
Because she has dared to contradict
her master, the king.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.969
Something needs to be done
very quickly,

17:16.969 --> 17:20.638
or they're going to arrest her,
and she knows what happens then.

17:20.638 --> 17:24.175
"They accuse you of incest,
witchcraft, treason

17:24.175 --> 17:26.310
and then they kill you."

17:26.310 --> 17:31.116
She looks up to the sky, to the God
who she thinks lives there,

17:31.116 --> 17:34.686
and she says,
"I feel very sick all of a sudden."

17:34.686 --> 17:36.288
And so we don't know,

17:36.288 --> 17:40.392
maybe she was very sick from stress
or whether she was just biding time.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.195
Catherine Parr laid in her bed

17:43.195 --> 17:48.467
until she was ready to speak to the
king about what had been going on.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.203
And, like, straight away
from that afternoon,

17:51.203 --> 17:53.806
Henry's like, "Catherine?"

17:53.806 --> 17:56.375
And Catherine goes
"Not today, dear."

17:56.375 --> 18:00.746
"I am terribly poorly
in my woman's parts."

18:00.746 --> 18:02.915
He comes again just before bedtime.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.883
"Can I say goodnight?"

18:04.883 --> 18:08.253
"Oh, don't come into my room.
My womb's haunted."

18:08.253 --> 18:10.189
And then the next morning,

18:10.189 --> 18:13.158
"Catherine,
I've brought you some soup."

18:13.158 --> 18:15.894
She's like,
"No, I'm bleeding out right now."

18:15.894 --> 18:19.064
"I'm sorry about the sheets.
I'll replace them."

18:19.064 --> 18:22.734
And he keeps going away.
He's getting more and more worried,

18:22.734 --> 18:26.605
which means that she knows she's
got him exactly where she wants him.

18:26.605 --> 18:32.244
So after a few days, he knocks
very tentatively like, "My love?"

18:32.244 --> 18:37.950
And she says "OK,
but don't be shocked by my visage."

18:37.950 --> 18:40.886
And when Henry walks in,
she explains to him

18:40.886 --> 18:44.756
that all she ever wanted
was to be exciting for him.

18:44.756 --> 18:47.893
She was a silly little woman
asking questions,

18:47.893 --> 18:50.929
and she says "Please,
I've been asking questions."

18:50.929 --> 18:54.600
"Tell me how should people
relate to their God?"

18:54.600 --> 18:59.071
And Henry's like,
"Oh. You wanted me to tell you?"

18:59.071 --> 19:04.743
And she says "Yes. All I've ever
wanted was to interest you,

19:04.743 --> 19:10.516
bemuse you, or perhaps distract you
from that ulcerated leg."

19:10.516 --> 19:12.718
And Henry goes like, "Ho, ho, ho."

19:12.718 --> 19:15.254
"I thought you was doing
a plot against me."

19:15.254 --> 19:17.890
(laughs)
And she was like, "No. No!"

19:17.890 --> 19:21.727
"Ever since you kind of put
your flaccid penis inside me,

19:21.727 --> 19:24.796
we've been
the very best of friends."

19:24.796 --> 19:27.833
And then Catherine
and Henry embraced

19:27.833 --> 19:30.536
as only a woman
who doesn't really love a man

19:30.536 --> 19:34.206
and a really fat man can embrace.
And Catherine was like,

19:34.206 --> 19:37.876
"Let's just now live together
happily for the rest of your days."

19:37.876 --> 19:39.444
"I mean, our days."

19:40.679 --> 19:45.651
So, on the 28th January, 1547,

19:45.651 --> 19:47.986
Henry VIII dies.

19:47.986 --> 19:51.757
It's the worst day of
Catherine Parr's life,

19:51.757 --> 19:53.992
and she realizes...

19:55.928 --> 19:58.463
"I can marry Thomas Seymour."

20:00.532 --> 20:04.670
"Oh no, I'm so sad." (laughs)

20:04.670 --> 20:08.473
"No, no, honestly I'm really sad.
I'm sorry you're dead."

20:08.473 --> 20:11.243
"How long do I have to wait
officially?"

20:11.243 --> 20:12.945
(laughs)

20:12.945 --> 20:17.516
And that is how
the most murderous king ever

20:17.516 --> 20:20.886
got bested by a lady with attitude.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.122
Catherine Parr.

20:25.123 --> 20:26.625
'Henry VIII might have been

20:26.625 --> 20:28.927
a syphilitic, ulcerated
fat, ginger man,

20:28.927 --> 20:30.429
but Sara's now drunk enough

20:30.429 --> 20:33.432
that she might snog him
for a bag of chips. Goodnight.'

21:38.964 --> 21:39.164
.
