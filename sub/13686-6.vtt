{\an8}(announcer)
Previously on "Ex on the Beach."

00:03.303 --> 00:05.171
{\an8}Alicia, it's the end
of the road for you.

00:05.238 --> 00:09.109
{\an5}(announcer)
Cory and Taylor succeeded in
booting out his ex, Alicia.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.845
Luis's still in the dark
about Victoria's secret.

00:11.911 --> 00:14.280
Luis is a pretty sensitive guy.
I don't know where his head

00:14.347 --> 00:16.149
or his heart is at right now.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.684
(announcer)
All hell broke out in the villa

00:17.751 --> 00:20.920
when the power of elimination
was given to the exes.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.655
Derrick, it's
your show now!

00:22.722 --> 00:24.357
I've done everything for you!

00:24.424 --> 00:25.925
{\an5}(announcer)
Derrick successfully
turned the house

00:25.992 --> 00:30.029
against Angela's boo, Tor'i,
and sent him packing.

00:30.096 --> 00:32.432
{\an5}And it's a cut.

00:30.096 --> 00:32.432
Oh, my God.

00:32.499 --> 00:33.900
{\an8}(announcer)
And tonight...

00:33.967 --> 00:35.969
{\an8}It was good
knowing you guys!

00:33.967 --> 00:35.969
{\an5}Likewise.

00:36.035 --> 00:38.304
{\an5}(announcer)
In the Shack of Secrets,
Luis finds out

00:38.371 --> 00:40.273
what Victoria's
been hiding from him.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.909
{\an5}Your words are bull(bleep).

00:40.340 --> 00:42.909
So, what the (bleep)
do you expect from me?

00:42.976 --> 00:44.611
{\an5}(announcer)
Haley's flirting with
Derrick again.

00:44.677 --> 00:47.180
And Chris's jealously
is starting to simmer.

00:47.247 --> 00:48.848
I'm thinking about if--
when we go back home,

00:48.915 --> 00:50.483
you're gonna be with me.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.319
{\an5}(announcer)
Elimination power
returns to the singles.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.521
You're (bleep) cut.

00:54.587 --> 00:57.791
And an explosive arrival
rocks the villa.

00:57.857 --> 01:02.061
Everybody is so (bleep)
mind-blown right now.

01:05.965 --> 01:09.135
{\an8}♪ It tastes so good
once it hits your lips ♪

01:09.202 --> 01:11.671
{\an8}♪ And I don't even
really get -- this is ♪

01:16.776 --> 01:19.145
{\an8}(announcer)
Ten reality
and social media stars

01:19.212 --> 01:20.947
{\an8}thought they were coming
to Hawaii

01:21.014 --> 01:23.082
{\an8}for the ultimate
singles getaway.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.185
{\an8}But their exes
had other plans.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.320
{\an8}It's a lovely morning
at the villa.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.255
{\an8}And here's where things stand.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.057
{\an8}Chris and Haley are
still trying to sort out

01:31.124 --> 01:33.660
{\an8}their complicated feelings.

01:33.726 --> 01:35.328
{\an8}Faith and June
are getting closer,

01:35.395 --> 01:37.697
{\an8}but not as fast
as Faith would like.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.833
{\an8}Paulie and Lexi
are going strong.

01:39.899 --> 01:43.002
{\an8}Luis is still confused about
where he stands with Victoria.

01:43.069 --> 01:46.940
{\an8}Maybe that's because she's
avoiding him like the plague.

01:47.006 --> 01:49.075
{\an8}And after Derrick booted Tor'i,

01:49.142 --> 01:51.044
Angela's single
but not ready to mingle.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.112
It's hard, just,
like, sitting around.

01:53.179 --> 01:55.748
I don't know what to do with
myself 'cause I only had him.

01:55.815 --> 01:59.752
Like, if I didn't love you guys
to death, I would've left.

01:59.819 --> 02:01.588
You'll see him again.

02:01.654 --> 02:03.890
Derrick's just
a bitch, you know?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.826
Angela just be tripping.
But you know what? I don't care.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.428
{\an8}I had to do what I had to do.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.131
{\an8}And if I'm going out,
I'm going out with a bang.

02:11.197 --> 02:13.233
Yeah, but don't
worry about it.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.834
(Angela)
Day one without Tor'i

02:14.901 --> 02:19.539
{\an8}and I've made it through
the morning without crying.

02:19.606 --> 02:22.442
Derrick better stay the (bleep)
out of my way

02:22.509 --> 02:23.776
{\an8}or it's gonna be World War Three
up in this bitch.

02:23.843 --> 02:26.846
When you get a chance,
can we talk?

02:28.948 --> 02:31.417
{\an5}(Paulie)
Angela's like the kind of girl
who you

02:31.484 --> 02:33.920
{\an8}bring home to Mama, but then
she punches your sister.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.422
So, at this point, I'm feeling
a little scared for Derrick

02:36.489 --> 02:38.391
'cause once Hurricane Angela
gets started,

02:38.458 --> 02:40.793
{\an8}she only picks up speed
and gets bigger and bigger.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.362
Send me the (bleep) home!

02:42.428 --> 02:45.031
That's why I gotta know, man,
'cause I don't (bleep) with you!

02:45.098 --> 02:47.700
I (bleep) hate you 'cause
you're a (bleep) fraud...

02:47.767 --> 02:49.402
A (bleep) fraud!

02:49.469 --> 02:53.273
{\an8}Bro, you are one step
away from literally

02:53.339 --> 02:55.108
{\an8}getting your
(bleep) chopped off.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.745
♪♪

03:01.648 --> 03:03.416
{\an1}(Angela)
The pickings are slim.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.184
{\an5}Let's go down the list.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.184
(chuckling)

03:05.251 --> 03:07.453
{\an5}T, no longer here.

03:05.251 --> 03:07.453
{\an1}Yeah.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.589
{\an6}Cory--

03:07.520 --> 03:09.589
Taylor will kill you.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.090
{\an6}Cory taken.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.090
{\an1}(laughing)

03:11.157 --> 03:12.592
{\an6}Chase...

03:11.157 --> 03:12.592
Only option so far.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.427
{\an5}Only options so far.

03:12.659 --> 03:14.427
{\an1}Luis.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.296
{\an6}Luis.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.296
{\an1}Mmm...

03:16.362 --> 03:18.831
{\an5}An option... eh?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.831
(chuckling)

03:18.898 --> 03:21.568
My ex, Luis, crushing me
is just showing me

03:21.634 --> 03:25.238
that he wanted to get some
alone time to talk about things.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.674
But, to be honest,
I like tall guys.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.410
{\an8}So, I'm gonna
keep chasing Chase.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.680
{\an8}Probably... the whole time.
(laughing)

03:33.746 --> 03:36.716
{\an1}All right, Chase, looks like
you're the lucky winner.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.017
(laughing)

03:38.084 --> 03:40.753
{\an5}Where you at, bro?

03:38.084 --> 03:40.753
(Luis)
I don't know?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.922
{\an5}Right, like, what's up?

03:40.820 --> 03:42.922
I don't even know.

03:42.989 --> 03:46.025
{\an1}The most contact that I've had
with her was when I crushed her.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.393
She gave me a hug, so...

03:47.460 --> 03:48.928
{\an1}I don't even know how
she feels about me.

03:48.995 --> 03:50.330
{\an5}(Luis)
Truthfully, there's
potential to find

03:50.396 --> 03:52.565
that connection
that we had before.

03:52.632 --> 03:56.169
{\an8}But I had this gut feeling right
now that something else went on

03:56.235 --> 03:59.138
while we were talking, and
I really can't shake it off.

03:59.205 --> 04:03.276
I have nothing against her,
like, she's cool, like, so...

04:03.343 --> 04:06.846
{\an5}(announcer)
While Luis wonders what
Victoria's hiding from him,

04:06.913 --> 04:08.915
Faith wonders why June
would rather bro out

04:08.982 --> 04:10.950
than hang out with her.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.319
{\an4}Best Ninja stance
you got, you ready?

04:11.017 --> 04:13.319
{\an3}Yeah.

04:13.386 --> 04:15.989
He can-- he try to hit
anybody's hand.

04:16.055 --> 04:20.093
(yelping)
Whaaa!

04:20.159 --> 04:21.226
Oh! (bleep)

04:21.293 --> 04:23.496
(Ninja yelling)

04:23.563 --> 04:25.598
I'm not a good Ninja.

04:25.665 --> 04:28.568
He's not giving me all the
attention that I want right now

04:28.635 --> 04:29.836
to be completely
honest with you.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.771
You'll love this.
It's called Ninja.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.273
Paulie's got short arms.
He's not gonna like this.

04:34.340 --> 04:35.708
That's hard.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.243
{\an5}I don't think--

04:35.775 --> 04:37.243
I just want him

04:37.310 --> 04:38.478
to give me attention,
like, he's cute

04:38.544 --> 04:40.213
and he's fun
but it's, like...

04:40.279 --> 04:44.017
I wanna be able to tell him--
I wanna be able to tell you,

04:44.083 --> 04:45.251
{\an5}"Get off me."

04:44.083 --> 04:45.251
Okay, okay.

04:45.318 --> 04:46.586
You know what I mean?

04:46.653 --> 04:48.421
{\an1}You want that
leave me alone...

04:48.488 --> 04:50.123
Yeah, I want you
to be extra.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.391
{\an5}Only the hands?

04:50.189 --> 04:51.391
Only for the
hands, right?

04:51.457 --> 04:52.925
{\an3}(bleep)

04:52.992 --> 04:54.494
{\an5}(Jasmine)
June, he needs
to give Faith more.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.095
She's not getting that
attention from him.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.364
{\an8}And I don't blame her, like, he
should be giving her attention.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.699
{\an8}And I'm, like,
"You need to talk to him.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.534
Stop telling me this,
go tell him that."

05:01.601 --> 05:05.038
{\an5}Just be on my--
Just be on me.

05:01.601 --> 05:05.038
{\an1}Yeah.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.372
I'm not getting that.

05:06.439 --> 05:08.741
Don't slap me, bro.
Don't slap me.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.009
{\an5}Start moving faster.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.009
(bleep)

05:10.076 --> 05:11.911
Don't slap me.

05:11.978 --> 05:15.214
{\an5}(announcer)
Poor Faith, all she wants
is some attention from June.

05:15.281 --> 05:18.051
{\an5}But maybe you should
all be paying attention
to the elevator.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.420
(woman)
We got a message!

05:20.486 --> 05:23.289
(man)
Message in the bottle!

05:23.356 --> 05:26.426
(Chris)
It's right here.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.829
Victoria... and Luis.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.565
The only way out is through.
You've been avoiding each other.

05:32.632 --> 05:35.368
{\an5}Please go down to the
Shack of Secrets and spend
some time together.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.738
(all)
Ohh...

05:38.805 --> 05:41.107
{\an8}I'm feeling confident.
I have nothing to hide.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.942
(bleep)

05:43.009 --> 05:45.244
But when I saw Victoria's face,
I was, like,

05:45.311 --> 05:47.647
"Here comes the bull(bleep)."

05:47.714 --> 05:49.148
{\an1}It was good
knowing you guys!

05:49.215 --> 05:52.785
Likewise.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.420
(Victoria)
I'm (bleep) scared.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.527
Let's see what's
going on.

06:04.564 --> 06:05.865
All right.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.633
I wonder what they're
doing down there.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.968
They said you've been
avoiding each other.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.071
(woman)
The only way out is through.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.341
{\an5}(man)
So about some real (bleep)
about to pop off.

06:15.408 --> 06:20.246
{\an5}"Sometimes to really understand
what happened in a relationship
you need to look back."

06:20.313 --> 06:21.514
"Press play."

06:23.049 --> 06:24.951
{\an5}(Victoria)
Nothing good ever comes
out of the Shack.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.953
{\an8}I'm going down.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.455
{\an5}<i>The last guy that I dated</i>
<i>which was already</i>
<i>over a year ago now.</i>

06:29.522 --> 06:33.426
{\an5}<i>But he was the last guy</i>
<i>that I was dating.</i>
<i>This was Luis.</i>

06:33.493 --> 06:37.830
<i>I didn't really, like, want</i>
<i>to be serious with someone.</i>

06:37.897 --> 06:42.635
{\an5}<i>While I was talking</i>
<i>to him, I was hooking up</i>
<i>with somebody else.</i>

06:42.702 --> 06:44.370
<i>You know, just having fun.</i>

06:44.437 --> 06:46.906
<i>And he was so hot, and I didn't</i>
<i>wanna stop hooking up with him.</i>

06:46.973 --> 06:49.509
<i>So, I was like, (bleep) it,</i>
<i>I'm just gonna keep doing it.</i>

06:50.977 --> 06:53.880
<i>I was actually hooking up</i>
<i>with two guys.</i>

06:53.946 --> 06:55.715
{\an5}(Luis)
I feel like I got
punched in the gut.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.683
Victoria's talking about
how she was hooking up with

06:57.750 --> 07:00.820
{\an8}not one but two guys
while we were together.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.288
{\an8}And I feel (bleep) played.

07:02.355 --> 07:06.726
{\an8}I feel like a (bleep) moron.
I feel like a fool.

07:09.562 --> 07:13.032
{\an5}Yeah, like, I hooked up
with somebody else right,
like, immediately basically.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.903
But this was, like,
it said, during.

07:16.969 --> 07:18.604
Like, your words are
bull(bleep).

07:18.671 --> 07:21.374
{\an8}Luis and I never established
whether we were together

07:21.440 --> 07:22.875
{\an8}or exclusive or anything.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.845
{\an8}I'm an independent bitch
so if I'm not your girlfriend,

07:25.912 --> 07:30.049
{\an8}I'm gonna do what
the (bleep) I wanna do.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.384
Ay!

07:31.450 --> 07:33.186
When we're in a relationship,

07:33.252 --> 07:35.288
if you do not clarify (bleep),

07:35.354 --> 07:38.191
then do not expect me
to act as your girlfriend.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.193
Point blank.
If you do not--

07:40.259 --> 07:42.228
If you do not make that a point

07:42.295 --> 07:45.231
then it will not happen.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.867
{\an5}And if you were
my boyfriend, then no,
I wouldn't have hooked up

07:47.934 --> 07:49.836
{\an6}with anybody else,
which again...

07:47.934 --> 07:49.836
{\an1}Good.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.404
you do not use your words,
you do not speak.

07:51.470 --> 07:53.072
{\an4}And I...

07:51.470 --> 07:53.072
So what the (bleep)
do you expect from me?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.707
You never have
anything to say.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.343
I'm sick of your (bleep).
Like, it's immature.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.146
{\an5}(Luis)
Victoria starts blaming
me for all this.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.914
Starts turning the tables on me.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.784
{\an8}And I'm, like,
"What the (bleep), hold up."

08:04.851 --> 08:06.219
{\an8}Where's the respect?

08:06.285 --> 08:09.021
So, I decided to watch
the video again because

08:09.088 --> 08:10.923
{\an8}I need to hear
every single word.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.558
<i>While I was talking to him,</i>

08:12.625 --> 08:14.193
<i>I was hooking up</i>
<i>with somebody else.</i>

08:14.260 --> 08:16.429
<i>He was sleeping over</i>
<i>my room every night.</i>

08:16.495 --> 08:19.198
{\an5}<i>Like, I'm not gonna</i>
<i>sleep alone, obviously.</i>
<i>And we were like...</i>

08:19.265 --> 08:20.900
(man)
<i>Unless the other guy's...</i>

08:20.967 --> 08:23.936
<i>Right, right, yeah...</i>
<i>(laughing) Exactly.</i>

08:25.271 --> 08:27.006
She literally said
I was hooking up with both

08:27.073 --> 08:28.674
and if I found out that I would
never talk to her again.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.042
{\an8}So, obviously it was worse
than what she was trying

08:30.109 --> 08:32.544
{\an8}to make it seem right
in front of my face.

08:32.611 --> 08:37.515
{\an8}(bleep) that man, that's...
(bleep) that, yo, (bleep) that.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.085
(bleep) that, yo.

08:40.753 --> 08:44.023
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up, the arrival
of a new housemate...

08:44.090 --> 08:45.291
{\an8}Oh, my God!

08:45.358 --> 08:47.326
Everybody is (bleep) mind-blown.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.262
{\an5}(announcer)
...Could destroy
Cory and Taylor.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.864
You think I really gotta
be here, hell, no, I don't.

08:56.435 --> 08:57.970
{\an1}(woman)
What happened?

08:58.037 --> 09:01.073
{\an5}(Victoria)
It all came out.
It's (bleep) bull(bleep).

09:01.140 --> 09:04.076
When he showed up on the beach,
I told him point blank,

09:04.143 --> 09:06.045
"Yeah, I did
entertain other people."

09:06.112 --> 09:09.682
{\an5}(announcer)
Entertaining, I think you
mean cheating, Victoria.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.851
You never made me your
girlfriend, and so, yeah.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.086
When somebody else is
pursuing me and being a man

09:14.153 --> 09:15.755
and making it clear to me
that they want me

09:15.821 --> 09:19.725
while you never
made (bleep) clear at all...

09:19.792 --> 09:21.961
Yeah, I entertained it.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.330
{\an5}(Luis)
Victoria's true colors
came out right away

09:24.397 --> 09:25.398
in the Shack of Secrets.

09:25.464 --> 09:26.632
She was hooking up with not

09:26.699 --> 09:29.835
{\an8}one but two guys while
we were together

09:29.902 --> 09:31.804
I knew it.
I (bleep) knew it.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.208
What the (bleep), like, I feel
like a (bleep) dumb ass.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.445
Awkward.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.047
(announcer)
Nailed it, Lexi,

09:41.113 --> 09:42.949
and it's about to get
a lot more awkward

09:43.015 --> 09:47.620
when the next batch of exes hit
the villa like a tsunami.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.956
(woman)
Show us the flags!

09:54.961 --> 09:57.029
(all)
Jasmine, Jasmine.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.731
{\an5}Yay!

09:57.096 --> 09:58.731
Finally.

09:58.798 --> 09:59.932
I'm nervous
to know that I possibly

09:59.999 --> 10:02.635
have an ex coming today
because any time

10:02.702 --> 10:04.103
{\an8}an ex comes in this house,

10:04.170 --> 10:05.771
{\an8}the house is just
flipped upside down.

10:05.838 --> 10:07.873
(all)
Cory!

10:07.940 --> 10:10.476
Why, God, why?
Why?

10:10.543 --> 10:13.980
Last time I saw my face on
that flag, Alicia was here.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.681
But, um, you know,
at this point,

10:15.748 --> 10:17.450
{\an8}I'm not really worried
about any of the exes.

10:17.516 --> 10:18.918
{\an8}As long as me and Taylor
are good,

10:18.985 --> 10:21.454
{\an8}I could care less
what ex comes into the house.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.324
{\an5}(all)
Cameron!

10:21.520 --> 10:25.324
Oh, (bleep).

10:25.391 --> 10:26.792
Cameron!

10:26.859 --> 10:29.395
{\an5}(Cameron)
I'm the only ex,
what the (bleep)?

10:29.462 --> 10:31.964
{\an8}When I saw my face on the flag,
first of all, I was, like,

10:32.031 --> 10:34.300
{\an8}what the (bleep) because
I'm an ex.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.868
{\an8}And that hasn't happened yet.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.671
So, like, I'm kind of just
feeling kind of weird right now.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.139
Like, I'm anxious, I'm nervous.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.841
Cam, you're the first
ex up there.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.275
I know, dude, what the (bleep)?

10:43.342 --> 10:44.977
{\an5}I'm nervous.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.977
Yeah?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.145
I don't know who it could be.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.582
{\an5}Either way,
I'm coming
back to you.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.289
Back on this mother...

10:57.356 --> 11:00.259
Back on the (bleep).

11:00.326 --> 11:02.561
(announcer)
And here's our host, Romeo.

11:02.628 --> 11:05.364
{\an8}Welcome back to the beach, baby.

11:05.431 --> 11:06.499
{\an8}(laughing)
I'm sick...

11:06.565 --> 11:08.434
I know Cory happy
to see me.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.802
'Bout to see which one of you

11:09.869 --> 11:13.873
about to be hit with
a new ex on the beach.

11:13.939 --> 11:16.208
{\an5}Me and Taylor,
we've already been
through the storm.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.877
We went through our two
worst exes, you know?

11:17.943 --> 11:20.346
She sent Andre home.
I sent Alicia home.

11:20.413 --> 11:25.051
{\an5}We got their ass sent home
right away, the next day,
bags packed, out.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.319
Ladies and gentlemen,
are y'all ready

11:27.386 --> 11:30.056
to meet a new ex?

11:30.122 --> 11:32.992
I say we bring him
or her out right now.

11:35.828 --> 11:39.031
{\an5}(Jasmine)
You know, I'm feeling anxious
about what's about to happen.

11:39.098 --> 11:42.902
{\an8}Maybe this is my time.
Maybe this is my ex.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.204
{\an5}(Cameron)
I got a few exes
I don't wanna see.

11:45.271 --> 11:46.705
{\an8}So, I'm kind of nervous
right now.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.607
Let's go.

11:52.878 --> 11:57.450
♪ Anything can happen now
anything can happen ♪

11:57.516 --> 11:59.685
Yeah, that's mine.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.821
♪ Oh, oh, oh ♪

12:01.887 --> 12:03.823
♪ Anything is possible... ♪

12:03.889 --> 12:05.257
{\an8}I'm Shanley, I am 27 years old,

12:05.324 --> 12:07.126
{\an8}and I'm from
South Bend, Indiana.

12:07.193 --> 12:10.229
People might recognize me from
"Are You The One," season one.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.231
And I'm like, the really cool
person that was on television

12:12.298 --> 12:15.534
or I'm that big bitch
that was on television.

12:15.601 --> 12:16.735
Cameron and I actually met on

12:16.802 --> 12:18.504
"Are You The One:
Second Chances."

12:18.571 --> 12:22.908
{\an5}He had a girlfriend
but we developed a pretty
good friendship.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.344
After filming, Cam broke up
with his girlfriend.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.979
And then there were
some feelings between

12:27.046 --> 12:29.048
Cam and I and, of course,
Cam freaked out.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.784
On my end, there could be
feelings still invested.

12:31.851 --> 12:33.352
I'm definitely
gonna go after him.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.154
So, how you feelin' about
Cameron over there?

12:35.221 --> 12:38.357
Honestly, I'm here to show him
what he's missing.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.526
{\an5}(chuckling)

12:38.424 --> 12:40.526
Oh!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.928
Oh, I like... okay.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.463
{\an5}What is he missing?

12:42.995 --> 12:44.463
The whole package.

12:44.530 --> 12:48.134
I mean, minus the boobs,
but everything else is here.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.469
{\an5}So he dropped the ball.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.469
{\an1}Oh, he dropped
the ball.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.838
I don't even know why, like...

12:52.905 --> 12:54.039
{\an8}She was the sweetest,
most caring girl

12:54.106 --> 12:55.508
{\an8}I've ever met in my life.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.410
But I was so worried about
our friendship ending,

12:58.477 --> 12:59.812
we didn't go any farther.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.780
I love that girl.
She's (bleep) amazing.

13:01.847 --> 13:05.784
{\an5}(announcer)
Aww... Well, now that the sweet
stuff's out of the way,

13:05.851 --> 13:07.853
it's time for some salty.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.655
Take it away, Romeo.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.557
So, as you all know,

13:11.624 --> 13:14.860
the exes voted off Tor'i,
one of the singles.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.863
So, we're down to nine of you.
But I think that

13:17.930 --> 13:21.033
we should bring the original
singles back up to ten.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.668
{\an1}What?
Are you kidding me?

13:22.735 --> 13:24.103
The more, the merrier, right?

13:24.170 --> 13:27.339
Are y'all ready to meet
the new single?

13:27.406 --> 13:32.178
Which means, they will
not be up for elimination.

13:32.244 --> 13:34.880
The singles are back in power.

13:39.351 --> 13:40.886
(Cory)
This is pure (bleep).

13:40.953 --> 13:43.022
{\an8}What kind of damn
plot twist is this?

13:50.262 --> 13:54.133
{\an5}Is that Alicia?

13:50.262 --> 13:54.133
No way! Oh, my...

13:56.068 --> 13:57.703
I'm Alicia.
I was previously in the house

13:57.770 --> 14:00.239
as Cory's ex
and I got eliminated.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.774
{\an8}Everybody's gonna regret
saying, "Bye, Alicia."

14:01.840 --> 14:03.108
I'm an OG now!

14:03.175 --> 14:04.944
This is breaking
news right now.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.379
{\an5}(Cory)
Nah, I'm done with this (bleep).
Ain't nobody coming in here

14:07.446 --> 14:09.248
acting like they're OG, man,
I'm done with this (bleep).

14:09.315 --> 14:12.151
{\an8}Derrick, Angela, Taylor, Cory,
I am back.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.753
{\an8}Wanted me out so bad but now
y'all can't get rid of me.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.522
{\an8}I'm gonna make that (bleep)
very well known.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.057
{\an8}Don't (bleep) with me.

14:18.123 --> 14:20.726
{\an5}(Cory)
Man, I'm done with this (bleep).
I'm done!

14:20.793 --> 14:22.194
{\an6}(Romeo)
Cory!

14:20.793 --> 14:22.194
I'm out, man!

14:22.261 --> 14:23.462
{\an5}Wait, Cory, come here!

14:22.261 --> 14:23.462
Nah, man, we already got

14:23.529 --> 14:24.797
her out of the house once!

14:24.863 --> 14:26.599
The house is gonna
freak the (bleep) out.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.500
{\an5}I'm out!

14:26.665 --> 14:28.500
I totally understand

14:28.567 --> 14:29.935
{\an8}you don't wanna deal with that
while you've built

14:30.002 --> 14:31.270
{\an8}something with
Taylor in the house.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.205
But I've never
seen Cory that mad.

14:33.272 --> 14:36.175
I can tell that he still
has feelings for Alicia

14:36.242 --> 14:39.044
{\an8}'cause no one gets that upset if
they don't care about someone.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.880
(Romeo)
Well, listen, Cam...

14:41.947 --> 14:43.716
I'ma give you some
one-on-one time

14:43.782 --> 14:45.751
with your former
boo thing, okay?

14:45.818 --> 14:47.086
{\an1}(laughing)
Former boo thing.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.520
{\an5}See y'all later.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.520
Bye!

14:48.587 --> 14:51.056
{\an5}See y'all at the
next elimination!

14:48.587 --> 14:51.056
{\an1}Yes.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.391
{\an4}(Shanley)
Have a drink ready
for me, please?

14:52.458 --> 14:53.759
I will. We'll have
some tequila.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.294
{\an5}Miss you!

14:53.826 --> 14:55.294
Oh, Jesus.

14:55.361 --> 14:58.897
Girl, welcome back.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.734
I'm excited to be
here with you.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.801
{\an3}"Shameron."

15:02.868 --> 15:04.403
That's gonna be the hashtag.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.238
You got a name?

15:06.305 --> 15:08.540
We've had that name.
You already forgot?

15:08.607 --> 15:10.743
{\an1}I didn't...
I didn't know.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.077
{\an1}(laughing)

15:12.144 --> 15:14.213
I've always had
a crush on Shanley.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.481
Like, ever since I met her.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.016
I love the tattoos.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.150
I love the way
she carries herself.

15:18.217 --> 15:19.618
You know, I kind of missed her.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.354
{\an8}I mean, it could be #Shameron
from here on out.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.522
{\an8}We'll just have to see.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.258
Have you... talked
to other girls?

15:26.325 --> 15:28.060
{\an4}I mean...

15:26.325 --> 15:28.060
Have you kissed
other girls?

15:28.127 --> 15:29.461
{\an1}No, I haven't
kissed any girls.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.463
Are there any guys that
I'd be attracted to?

15:31.530 --> 15:32.898
{\an1}(laughing)

15:32.965 --> 15:35.467
Uh, um... maybe.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.604
I mean, there's no, like,
skinny guys really, so...

15:38.671 --> 15:39.672
{\an6}(snickers)

15:38.671 --> 15:39.672
I'm, like...

15:39.738 --> 15:40.906
You're the only one?

15:40.973 --> 15:42.374
{\an4}There's, like,
a skinny, short guy.

15:40.973 --> 15:42.374
{\an3}Mmm.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.710
{\an8}I'm absolutely just
attracted to the fact

15:44.777 --> 15:46.111
{\an8}that he's just
this lanky noodle.

15:46.178 --> 15:48.280
{\an8}If he wants to have
a future with me,

15:48.347 --> 15:50.949
{\an8}we'd have cute little babies.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.651
{\an8}My little noodles.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.754
{\an5}(announcer)
While Shanley's feeling
the love for Cameron,

15:55.821 --> 15:59.391
Cory's about to find out what
single Alicia's all about.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.592
Pack your things and go!

16:00.659 --> 16:02.394
What the (bleep) is wrong
with you?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.029
{\an5}You literally are horrible.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.029
You know what you're doing, man.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.398
{\an5}You know what you're doing!

16:04.096 --> 16:06.398
What am I doing?

16:06.465 --> 16:09.401
{\an5}Why the (bleep) would
you come back when
we sent you home once!

16:09.468 --> 16:10.936
I'm not about to sit up here
and watch you

16:11.003 --> 16:12.271
in the house
get with somebody else.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.540
I know Alicia's
gonna hook up with somebody.

16:14.606 --> 16:17.109
{\an8}Just to get at me
out of spite, you know?

16:17.176 --> 16:20.312
{\an8}And will it hurt me?
It will kill me to see that.

16:20.379 --> 16:23.349
{\an5}(announcer)
Uh-oh, it looks
like Cory actually

16:23.415 --> 16:25.284
does still have
feelings for Alicia.

16:25.351 --> 16:29.421
Yeah, I'm sure Taylor will be
just fine with that.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.622
Who am I getting with?!

16:30.689 --> 16:32.624
Why else would
you come back, Alicia?

16:32.691 --> 16:33.926
I'm on a free vacation, Cory.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.427
I can do whatever
the (bleep) I want!

16:35.494 --> 16:38.330
{\an8}This is single Alicia.
So, I can do whoever I want.

16:38.397 --> 16:40.899
{\an5}I never once to anybody
in this house talked
bad about you.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.568
I never once disrespected you.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.236
There's still feelings there...

16:44.303 --> 16:45.771
{\an1}No (bleep), Sherlock,
no (bleep).

16:45.838 --> 16:48.440
So, why would you put this
in a situation like that?

16:48.507 --> 16:49.975
Don't act like the
love still isn't there.

16:50.042 --> 16:52.311
We just ended this
(bleep) two weeks ago.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.713
{\an1}If that's how you still...
If that's how you felt then you

16:54.780 --> 16:56.715
wouldn't have been so easy
to jump onto somebody else.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.318
{\an4}I would've had more respect
for you if you would
have waited a few days.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.053
{\an1}But the first (bleep)
night, you're over here

17:01.120 --> 17:02.755
{\an1}thrusting your (bleep),
like, come on.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.857
{\an1}And then you wanna come back
and try to basically prove

17:04.923 --> 17:06.892
{\an1}a point to me or, like,
shove something in my face?

17:06.959 --> 17:09.762
What, I'm supposed to stay at
home and know that you're here

17:09.828 --> 17:11.463
{\an1}(bleep) some other bitch
and I'm just supposed to be

17:11.530 --> 17:14.266
at home (bleep) crying
over it? (Bleep) that.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.868
{\an8}Everybody wants to let Cory and
Taylor live happily ever after.

17:16.935 --> 17:18.637
(bleep) y'all.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.673
Hide your man, watch your mouth
and that's that.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.280
{\an1}I swear to God if I dropped
everything and I said

17:28.347 --> 17:30.182
I wanna be with you,
you would be with me.

17:30.249 --> 17:33.519
{\an1}You can't wake up every day,
look me in my face and say you

17:33.585 --> 17:36.188
don't give a (bleep) the same
way I can't do it towards you.

17:36.255 --> 17:37.956
If you think you're
gonna come here and enjoy

17:38.023 --> 17:40.926
{\an1}this beautiful paradise,
this (bleep) ain't paradise.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.394
Nothing about this
is paradise.

17:42.461 --> 17:43.929
My head is (bleep) up.
My head is twisted.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.265
And you know it was
but you still wanna

17:46.331 --> 17:47.633
come back and try to
do that to me, man.

17:47.699 --> 17:48.967
{\an1}That (bleep) is wrong.
You just came back for what?

17:49.034 --> 17:50.469
What am I doing?

17:50.536 --> 17:53.338
{\an5}Why would you
come back, though?
To do you?

17:53.405 --> 17:55.541
{\an3}Have fun.

17:58.377 --> 17:59.945
{\an8}Cory just wanted to come here
and have his cake

18:00.012 --> 18:02.314
{\an8}and eat it too, and now that
it's smacking him in the face,

18:02.381 --> 18:04.116
{\an8}he doesn't know what to do
with it. The first time, yes,

18:04.183 --> 18:05.884
it was for him,
but now this is for me.

18:05.951 --> 18:08.320
Like, why can't
I enjoy what I'm doing?

18:08.387 --> 18:09.555
But again,
that doesn't mean that I'm gonna

18:09.621 --> 18:12.324
be laid-up in the bed
with some dude.

18:12.391 --> 18:13.959
Unless it's Romeo.
Just kidding.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.561
{\an5}(announcer)
While Alicia tries
to convince herself

18:15.627 --> 18:17.996
that she doesn't want Cory,

18:18.063 --> 18:19.698
Victoria's busy trying
to convince herself

18:19.765 --> 18:21.400
that she didn't cheat on Luis.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.068
(Victoria)
It was a load of bull(bleep).

18:23.135 --> 18:27.172
I said that I, like,
hooked up with other people.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.708
I only told him about one guy
that I hooked up with.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.844
While she was telling me to come
back with her every night

18:31.910 --> 18:34.046
to go to her bed, but meanwhile,
while I was away at baseball,

18:34.112 --> 18:36.081
she was (bleep) around
with two other dudes.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.250
Wasn't one, it was two.

18:38.317 --> 18:39.952
If you don't treat me
like your girlfriend,

18:40.018 --> 18:41.553
I'm not treating you
like my boyfriend.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.955
I'm spending almost every
hour of the day with you.

18:43.021 --> 18:44.156
I'm sleeping
in your (bleep) bed.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.324
What the (bleep)
else do I have to--

18:45.390 --> 18:46.892
{\an5}What else do I have to say?

18:45.390 --> 18:46.892
{\an1}Yeah.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.160
Guys are allowed
to hurt you.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.863
But you're not
allowed to hurt them.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.397
That's how they are.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.833
{\an5}(Victoria)
I think Luis is
a pretty sensitive guy

18:54.900 --> 18:56.235
but only to the extent of

18:56.301 --> 18:58.504
{\an8}if his feelings
are getting hurt, not mine.

18:58.570 --> 19:01.440
{\an5}(announcer)
Now that we got
that cleared up...

19:01.507 --> 19:02.875
{\an3}Oh, my God.

19:02.941 --> 19:05.410
Looks like things are heating up
for Haley and Derrick.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.379
How you feeling
about that, Chris?

19:07.446 --> 19:09.047
{\an5}I'm so extra...

19:07.446 --> 19:09.047
{\an3}I know.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.616
No, the best is whenever
you're irritated,

19:10.682 --> 19:12.651
you're, like, ignoring
your eye rolls.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.553
They're the most dramatic
thing, you're, like...

19:14.620 --> 19:15.988
{\an1}Yeah, like, it's the
dumbest (bleep) ever, like...

19:16.054 --> 19:17.489
No, but it's hilarious.

19:17.556 --> 19:20.526
{\an4}If I wasn't extra,
would I be me?

19:17.556 --> 19:20.526
No, no, for real.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.930
{\an4}Who?

19:23.161 --> 19:24.930
{\an3}Haley.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.565
{\an1}Oh, Haley makes
you nervous?

19:26.632 --> 19:29.701
I just-- she just
throws mixed vibes, bro.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.704
{\an1}You know, like, Lexi's not,
like, flirting with...

19:32.771 --> 19:37.409
{\an4}I mean, I don't even know--
I'm just, I just a really
overprotective guy.

19:37.476 --> 19:41.213
So, I take any
conversation to heart.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.117
{\an5}Recently, I feel, like,
Haley is not here for me,
she's here for attention.

19:45.183 --> 19:46.351
{\an8}That's how you're gonna play me,

19:46.418 --> 19:47.920
{\an8}I don't wanna
be played like that.

19:47.986 --> 19:49.454
Yeah...

{\an5}(woman)
Wait, they're coming
up right now.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.637
{\an5}(announcer)
I don't know about you
but I think Taylor and Alicia

20:05.704 --> 20:09.575
are gonna hug it out
like long lost friends.

20:09.641 --> 20:13.345
Ha-ho! Just kidding.
Grab your popcorn, everyone.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.081
{\an5}Alicia's back.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.081
Oh, my God.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.884
{\an5}(Angela)
Alicia walks in through
the door, and I cannot believe

20:18.951 --> 20:21.286
I'm seeing
this bitch once again.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.955
{\an8}What the (bleep)
is she doing here?

20:23.021 --> 20:25.023
You gotta be (bleep) kidding me.

20:25.090 --> 20:26.925
Shut the (bleep) up!

20:26.992 --> 20:28.694
(man)
Oh, my God!

20:28.760 --> 20:30.162
Everybody is so

20:30.228 --> 20:33.632
{\an8}(bleep) mind-blown right now.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.034
Why did my man have to go
and that bitch is back?

20:36.101 --> 20:38.036
(man)
Oh, my (bleep) God!

20:38.103 --> 20:39.871
(Faith)
What is going on?!

20:39.938 --> 20:42.140
{\an8}Hide your remotes!

20:42.207 --> 20:44.309
Alicia said, "Bitch, I'm back."

20:44.376 --> 20:46.511
I can't take this (bleep).

20:46.578 --> 20:50.415
{\an8}Winter is here!
Winter is here!

20:54.119 --> 20:55.587
(Faith)
Alicia's back.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.889
You gotta be
(bleep) kidding me.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.458
{\an5}Hello.

20:57.956 --> 20:59.458
How are you doing?

20:59.524 --> 21:01.293
I'm chilling.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.730
{\an8}I scan everyone, find Derrick.
Lock on, he looks...

21:08.667 --> 21:10.035
{\an8}For five minutes.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.372
Oh, (bleep).

21:13.438 --> 21:15.007
{\an5}(Chase)
What the hell
is Alicia doing back?

21:15.073 --> 21:18.543
{\an8}Why in the world would you wanna
come back to this and watch Cory

21:18.610 --> 21:21.713
{\an8}dig it out with Taylor
every single day?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.682
{\an8}Why?

21:23.749 --> 21:26.451
{\an8}(Cory)
I mean, I'm all twisted,
thinking long-term,

21:26.518 --> 21:28.387
{\an8}thinking short-term,
thinking, who makes me happy?

21:28.453 --> 21:30.288
{\an8}Who's gonna be there for me
at the end of the day?

21:30.355 --> 21:32.157
{\an8}There's a lot
going through my head.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.362
(clatter)

21:39.598 --> 21:41.466
{\an5}(Shanley)
This house is definitely
very dramatic.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.468
I don't know
what I just walked into.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.904
{\an8}This place is actually
terrifying.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.406
Alicia is SLL.

21:47.472 --> 21:51.910
She's not an ex, so she's
not getting eliminated.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.279
{\an5}She's an OG now.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.279
Shut the (bleep) up.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.782
I'm jumping. I swear
to God, I'm jumping.

21:56.848 --> 21:57.983
I'm jumping.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.919
{\an8}No!

22:00.986 --> 22:03.422
(clatter)

22:03.488 --> 22:05.057
(bleep) this (bleep) show.

22:05.123 --> 22:07.826
{\an5}(Faith)
Just when you thought you
could eliminate somebody

22:07.893 --> 22:12.197
{\an8}and they out of here,
they're back like herpes!

22:12.264 --> 22:15.133
I'm shook.
I'm shook to the core.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.202
Everybody should be shook.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.308
I'm gonna shower.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.377
{\an1}I just want to shower.
I'm sorry.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.846
I'm showering.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.846
You good, bro?

22:27.913 --> 22:29.815
{\an3}(bleep) me!

22:29.881 --> 22:32.451
What's up, Derrick?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.753
{\an1}What's up?

22:32.517 --> 22:34.753
Welcome back.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.321
(laughter)

22:36.388 --> 22:38.123
{\an4}What's really good,
Derrick?

22:36.388 --> 22:38.123
Welcome back.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.491
{\an1}Am I still
too above it or not?

22:39.558 --> 22:41.460
{\an5}The answer's not.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.460
Nah, you're cool.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.462
I'm not trippin'.
Hey, welcome back.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.097
{\an1}You took the power
the wrong way.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.832
{\an5}(Derrick)
Well, Alicia is my friend,
but, you know,

22:46.898 --> 22:49.468
{\an8}I voted to get Alicia
out of the house.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.370
{\an8}I have to give a cut
to Alicia.

22:52.437 --> 22:55.307
{\an8}I know she's gonna gun for me
and get payback.

22:55.373 --> 22:57.375
{\an1}There's no way I survive
elimination now, bro.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.810
It's literally...

22:57.442 --> 22:58.810
{\an3}Why?

22:58.877 --> 23:01.346
{\an1}I have so many (bleep) people
that's gonna target me.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.415
{\an1}Bro, between Angela,
who hates me...

23:03.482 --> 23:06.318
{\an1}between my (bleep) good friend
who I sent home, who's now back,

23:06.384 --> 23:09.855
bro, what the (bleep)
just really happened?

23:09.921 --> 23:11.523
{\an8}Bro...

23:11.590 --> 23:13.225
Hug me, bro. Really,
can you just hug me?

23:13.291 --> 23:14.593
{\an1}'Cause I need to
hug somebody, bro,

23:14.659 --> 23:16.161
'cause I don't know what
the (bleep) is going on!

23:16.228 --> 23:18.029
Chase, what the (bleep)?

23:18.096 --> 23:21.032
{\an5}(announcer)
While Chase tries to help
his bro Derrick cool off,

23:21.099 --> 23:25.203
{\an8}things are already heating up
for hashtag #Shameron.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.175
{\an8}Damn, you know?

23:30.242 --> 23:31.810
{\an8}Like, I kinda...
I kinda hated

23:31.877 --> 23:34.679
{\an8}that I quit what
was going on there,

23:34.746 --> 23:37.415
{\an8}so, you know, I want to
see what's there.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.826
{\an8}You know what?
The drunker I get,

23:47.893 --> 23:49.828
{\an8}the better she looks,
you know? (bleep) damn,

23:49.895 --> 23:52.230
{\an8}that's a country
saying right there.

23:49.895 --> 23:52.230
{\an7}But...

23:52.297 --> 23:54.966
(chatter)

23:55.033 --> 23:58.303
No! Don't do that here!

23:58.370 --> 24:00.238
{\an5}Don't do it!
Don't do it!

23:58.370 --> 24:00.238
How dare you!

24:09.114 --> 24:10.382
Where do you want
to go and talk?

24:10.448 --> 24:12.083
{\an1}I don't know.

Chris is my boy and I want to
have his back and everything,

32:33.618 --> 32:35.853
{\an8}but at the end of the day,
I really can't take

32:35.920 --> 32:38.790
{\an8}any argument between Chris
and any of his exes serious

32:38.856 --> 32:42.560
because one second he loves 'em,
the next second he hates 'em.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.530
If you cut Haley,

32:45.596 --> 32:48.533
{\an1}if somebody gave her
two Xs, that's it.

32:48.599 --> 32:50.101
{\an1}We've got to get
two people to cut her.

32:50.168 --> 32:51.803
I think Cory and Taylor

32:51.869 --> 32:53.705
{\an1}are probably the
two people to talk to,

32:53.771 --> 32:55.273
{\an1}'cause, like,
their votes matter,

32:55.340 --> 32:57.041
but they're not
invested in this

32:57.108 --> 32:59.777
{\an1}because they're worrying
about OG situations,

32:59.844 --> 33:03.314
{\an1}you know, and Chase,
the same thing.

33:03.381 --> 33:04.916
I could talk to Chase.

33:04.982 --> 33:07.185
{\an5}Maybe you could talk
to Taylor and Cory.

33:04.982 --> 33:07.185
I'll talk to Taylor.

really loudly to me,

aren't friends,

33:20.131 --> 33:23.234
{\an8}when it comes to me, oh, they'll
team up and give me some cuts.

33:23.301 --> 33:24.769
{\an1}Hey, Alicia,
can I talk to you?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.671
{\an7}Right now, it's not looking
too good for me.
