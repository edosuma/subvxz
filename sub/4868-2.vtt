What do you think?

00:04.433 --> 00:05.633
Can I pull off a bandeau top?

00:05.667 --> 00:07.266
You think I have
the upper arms for it?

00:08.700 --> 00:11.233
- Hey, guys.
- Hey! How was that nap?

00:11.266 --> 00:13.433
Good.
I feel quite unsettled.

00:13.433 --> 00:15.266
- Really?
- I had a weird dream.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.233
Oh. Where your teeth
turned to peanuts?

00:17.266 --> 00:18.633
No. It was me
and the Property Brothers.

00:18.667 --> 00:20.166
Oh! Drew and Jonathan?

00:20.166 --> 00:21.433
- Did they redo our kitchen?
- No.

00:21.467 --> 00:23.000
No, it wasn't what you
see on HGTV.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.567
It was much more, um...

00:25.567 --> 00:26.667
sexual.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.533
I am gonna need
to know everything.

00:28.567 --> 00:30.300
- Not in front of the baby.
- Why? She can't understand

00:30.333 --> 00:32.166
- anything we're saying.
- She absolutely can!

00:32.166 --> 00:34.567
Dr. Rivera said she's
ahead of every milestone.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.300
- Of course she is.
- She might not be able

00:36.333 --> 00:38.333
to say it back to us,
but she totally understands us.

00:38.367 --> 00:39.667
- Right, Char?
- [giggles]

00:39.700 --> 00:41.333

- Okay.

00:41.367 --> 00:42.667
Then just use other
words for it.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.066
Okay, um...

00:44.100 --> 00:45.467
they took off, um...

00:45.467 --> 00:47.066
my tarp?

00:47.066 --> 00:48.033
- Yeah...
- And...

00:48.066 --> 00:50.133
There was no...carpet?

00:50.166 --> 00:53.467
Even though there is
carpet in real life.

00:53.467 --> 00:54.533
Interesting.

00:54.567 --> 00:57.667
And then they took out
their...yardsticks

00:57.700 --> 00:58.734
- and, um...
- Yeah?

00:58.734 --> 01:00.133
Measured me.

01:00.166 --> 01:01.467
Oh. They measured you?

01:01.467 --> 01:03.133
- Both of them measured you?
- Yeah.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.600
From different angles.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.200
Different angles?

01:06.233 --> 01:08.166
- At the same time?
- Yes. Yes.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.333
Did you enjoy that?

01:09.333 --> 01:10.567
Of course I enjoyed it!

01:10.600 --> 01:12.467
Who doesn't want to be measured
from different angles

01:12.467 --> 01:14.200
by the Property Brothers?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
Wait. Where was I
at the time?

01:15.233 --> 01:16.533
You came in about
mid-stream

01:16.567 --> 01:18.467
and started telling me
how to do it better.

01:18.467 --> 01:20.233
- But that was helpful, right?
- Not really.

01:20.233 --> 01:21.333
Oh, that's upsetting.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.367
Why didn't you just
tell me to stop?

01:22.367 --> 01:23.367
I did.
I said, "Shut up,"

01:23.367 --> 01:25.467
and you just kept going.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.333
Hmm. That's not like me
in real life at all.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.567
- Mm.
- Wow!

01:28.600 --> 01:30.333
- You know what this means.
- What?

01:30.367 --> 01:32.633
You--your body,
your mind is telling you

01:32.633 --> 01:34.100
that it's time.

01:34.100 --> 01:36.333
- Time for what?
- Time to get that body worked,

01:36.367 --> 01:37.767
and I'm gonna find
a guy to do it.

01:37.767 --> 01:39.233
- No.
- I accept this challenge,

01:39.233 --> 01:41.066
- madam.
- No, not interested.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.367
And I do agree--we need
to rethink that carpet.

01:43.367 --> 01:45.100
Maybe go
full Spanish tile?

01:45.100 --> 01:46.166
Ha ha. Never.

01:46.200 --> 01:47.233
- A little runner?
- No.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.033
- Low pile?
- I prefer full shag,

01:49.066 --> 01:51.066
- thank you very much.
- Ugh!

01:51.100 --> 01:53.100
You never have to look
at it if you don't want to.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.700
But knowing that it's there
makes me uncomfortable.

soft touches?

06:56.767 --> 06:58.734
Yeah.
'Cause I'm nursing.

06:58.767 --> 07:01.033
What are you gonna do
if things get hot and heavy?

07:01.066 --> 07:02.100
Easy access.
Want a boob?

07:02.100 --> 07:03.200
Flop, there it is.

07:03.233 --> 07:04.600
- Flop, there it is?
- Yeah.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.233
Nobody wants that.

07:06.233 --> 07:07.767
Well, I don't know
why not.

07:07.767 --> 07:10.166
'Cause these things are bigger
than they've ever been,

07:10.200 --> 07:12.100
and I'm proud
because they're filled

07:12.100 --> 07:13.300
with life-giving milk.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.233
Nuh-uh. You are wearing
one of my bras,

07:15.233 --> 07:17.033
and I do not wanna hear
"human milk" mentioned

07:17.066 --> 07:18.767
one time tonight.

07:18.767 --> 07:21.233
Okay, well, that's just
like 75% of my life right now,

07:21.233 --> 07:22.367
so milk, milk, milk.

07:22.367 --> 07:23.433
- Stop it.
- Human milk.

07:23.467 --> 07:24.467
Stop saying it.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.500
What about milk,
though?

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
Don't push me.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.734
- Oh, delicious, sweet milk.
- Okay.

07:28.767 --> 07:30.600
All right, we gotta
get you buckled in tight,

07:30.633 --> 07:32.200
baby C,
because the Dunkles

07:32.233 --> 07:34.467
are gonna take you
on the adventure...

07:34.500 --> 07:35.667
- of a lifetime!
- [chuckles]

07:35.700 --> 07:37.667
Our watchword
this evening is...

07:37.700 --> 07:39.133
sophistication.

07:39.166 --> 07:41.400
And for our first course,

07:41.433 --> 07:44.133
les carrottes tendues.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.667
Zach, buddy, she can't
even say dada yet.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.333
I don't think
she's gonna talk Spanish.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.533
Bruce, babies are just
tiny adults, right,

07:50.533 --> 07:52.133
with unfinished bodies.

07:52.133 --> 07:53.767
I refuse to talk
down to them.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.767
N'est-ce pas,
my petite genie?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.233
Tiny genie.
I like that.

07:58.266 --> 07:59.333
Okay, guys, so we're gonna
head out--

07:59.367 --> 08:01.533
[comical horn sound]
Ow-ooh-ga!

08:01.533 --> 08:03.767
If I weren't your brother,
I'd find you very attractive,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.333
but there's no--
I feel nothing.

08:05.367 --> 08:06.467
Okay. She looks great.

08:06.500 --> 08:08.367
Now, Maggie is not
to be bothered tonight,

08:08.400 --> 08:10.734
so if there are any problems,
you call me.

08:10.767 --> 08:13.000
Don't worry--the Dunkles
have it under control.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.400
Hey, baby girl,
wish your mama luck, okay?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.266
'cause I'm gonna have
to be like...

08:16.266 --> 08:17.433
- Ooh!
- Mm...

08:17.467 --> 08:18.633
- You see that?
- Ooh!

08:18.667 --> 08:20.433
(Emma)
You wanna taste this?

08:20.433 --> 08:24.033
'Cause she's Smuckers!
It's made to impress!

08:24.033 --> 08:26.300
I apologize for this
bawdy display, Charlotte.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.400
[both laugh]

08:27.433 --> 08:29.033
[baby babbles]

08:29.033 --> 08:30.533
[pop music playing]

08:30.567 --> 08:32.433
I know, I've met
so many weirdoes.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.033
[laughing]
I know, right?

08:34.066 --> 08:36.667
I'm just glad that you're
not my Driver's Ed teacher.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.767
Well, I am gonna need
to see you parallel park.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.133
[both laugh]

08:40.166 --> 08:41.700
Oh, well,
I'm happy to do that.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.166
So, Maggie...

08:43.166 --> 08:44.300
Yeah.

08:44.333 --> 08:46.166
Do you...
like to party?

08:46.200 --> 08:47.500
You like to have fun?

08:47.533 --> 08:49.000
All right, that's it.
Date's over.

08:49.033 --> 08:50.100
(Maggie)
Wait--why?

08:50.133 --> 08:51.700
Because by "party,"
he means cocaine,

08:51.700 --> 08:54.133
and by "fun," he means having
sex with multiple people.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.633
That is not what he means.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.567
- That is what I mean.
- Oh, God, get outta here.

08:57.567 --> 08:59.333
- Get outta here, man.
- So that's a no.

08:59.367 --> 09:02.433
Go. Maggie, I am so sorry
about that.

09:02.467 --> 09:04.400
What do you think he meant
by parallel park?

09:04.433 --> 09:06.000
It's when I grease up
my thighs...

09:06.033 --> 09:07.400
[both scream]
- And use my fingers to--

09:07.433 --> 09:09.467
(both) No, no--
- Side by side--

09:09.500 --> 09:11.567
Be on your way, sir.
Be on your way!

09:16.667 --> 09:17.000
.

09:17.066 --> 09:17.433
- That guy was awful!

09:17.433 --> 09:17.700
- That guy was awful!
- I know, I know,

09:19.100 --> 09:20.266
but he was just
a warm-up, okay?

09:20.300 --> 09:21.533
Now, have some of
this Gingy...

09:21.567 --> 09:23.066
All right, that's enough.
That's enough.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.333
You gotta pace yourself.

09:24.333 --> 09:25.600
You got eight to ten
more guys coming.

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
Wait--what?
I said one guy.

09:27.633 --> 09:30.333
No, you said one night
of plaisair--

09:30.333 --> 09:32.333
Okay, I would never say
plaisair.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.533
All right, well, I got
a whole batch

09:33.567 --> 09:34.734
of hot bachelors coming,

09:34.734 --> 09:36.433
so I want you
to get ready, all right?

09:36.467 --> 09:38.333
Okay, fine, but will you
just sit a little further away

09:38.333 --> 09:40.333
- for the next one?
- Why? Oh, was I making you

09:40.367 --> 09:42.100
uncomfortable?
Were you judging yourself?

09:42.100 --> 09:44.734
No, it's just...
every time there's a silence,

09:44.767 --> 09:46.100
your breath fills it.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.233
- What do you mean?
- You breathe really loud.

09:48.233 --> 09:49.500
- I don't breathe loud.
- Yeah, you do.

09:49.533 --> 09:51.600
This is me breathing
normally...hah...

09:51.633 --> 09:53.100
- That is so loud!
- That's not loud.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.734
That is crazy loud,
man!

09:54.767 --> 09:56.600
[exhales]
All right, well, fine--

09:56.633 --> 09:58.233
- What? That was it?
- Yeah.

09:58.233 --> 09:59.567
Okay, fine.
I'll sit at the bar.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
Great. Thank you.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.100
- Hah...
- Milk!

10:02.100 --> 10:03.467
- Hah--
- Milk.

10:05.233 --> 10:07.633
[whistling]

10:07.667 --> 10:09.367
Miss Charlotte,
prepare yourself,

10:09.367 --> 10:12.600
for tonight we go
on a literary expedition.

10:12.633 --> 10:13.767
For story time
this evening,

10:13.767 --> 10:16.333
you have a choice.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.100
We could read Moby-Dick...

10:18.100 --> 10:20.633
a riveting tale
of vengeance and obsession

10:20.667 --> 10:24.233
and exploration of mid-19th
century whaling practices.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.600
Or we could dive into
James Joyce's

10:26.633 --> 10:28.633
A Portrait of the Artist
as a Young Man.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.333
Now, this is a much more dense
and challenging narrative,

10:31.367 --> 10:33.233
but I find it
worth the struggle.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.533
Or you could watch
a matinee showing

10:35.567 --> 10:37.533
of Fartsterpiece Theater!

10:37.567 --> 10:39.000
Pfffttt, pffftt, pff--

10:39.033 --> 10:41.133
Bruce, no.
No, no, no.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.367
Don't let her tiny
baby body deceive you.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.667
Speak not to her cherubic
little cheeks.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.100
Speak to her inquisitive
mind.

10:48.133 --> 10:50.000
Come on, man.
Everybody loves farts.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.133
Oh, weally, Bwuce?

10:51.133 --> 10:53.400
Bwucey loves fwatuwence?

10:53.400 --> 10:54.767
Why are you talking
to me like that?

10:55.000 --> 10:56.266
Exactly.
It's patronizing.

10:56.266 --> 10:58.133
Huh? Ah.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.133
It appears the lady's
made her choice.

11:00.133 --> 11:03.000
And so we venture
into the deep.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.133
Pffft!

11:04.166 --> 11:06.400
Bruce, no.
No.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.033
[rock music playing]

11:08.033 --> 11:10.166
[sighs]

11:10.200 --> 11:11.700
Hey, sorry I'm late.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.266
So what's your deal?

11:13.300 --> 11:16.033
You just gonna have
a jam sesh here on this date?

11:16.033 --> 11:18.166
No, no, my recording session
just ran a little bit long,

11:18.200 --> 11:20.233
and, you know, I couldn't
just leave it on my motorcycle,

11:20.266 --> 11:21.266
so I brought it in.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.300
I'm sorry, wait.
You ride a hog?

11:23.333 --> 11:25.100
- Yeah.
- That's pretty cool.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.166
What kind of music
do you play?

11:27.166 --> 11:29.300
Mostly bluegrass, country,
you know.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.166
Have you ever heard of
the Apple Dumpling Gang?

11:31.166 --> 11:33.166
Actually, Rondo's teaching me
how to play banjo.

11:33.166 --> 11:35.567
- Shut your face!
- Okay, but it's true, though.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.433
God, I can't believe
that you know Rondo.

11:37.433 --> 11:39.433
They're like my favorite
band of all time.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.033
- I love those guys.
- Oh, my God.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.300
What a small world.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.700
- You know what?
- What?

11:45.734 --> 11:48.333
You should meet
our waitress Rosanna.

11:48.367 --> 11:49.734
She's learning to play
the mandolin,

11:49.767 --> 11:51.333
she has the voice
of an angel,

11:51.333 --> 11:53.467
and she rides a Harley.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.333
Rosanna?
Come here for a second.

11:55.333 --> 11:57.467
[laughs]
I want you to meet Carlos.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.600
Carlos knows Rondo.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.066
Shut your face!

12:00.066 --> 12:01.333
Why do y'all
keep saying that?

12:01.333 --> 12:03.066
[laughter]

12:03.066 --> 12:05.567
- Excuse me for just one second.
- Okay, excuse us.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.033
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

12:07.066 --> 12:08.266
[whispering]
What? They're perfect
for each other.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.133
I did not wrestle you
out of your pregnancy jeans

12:10.166 --> 12:11.200
to get Rosanna's body
worked!

12:11.233 --> 12:13.467
I thought she would
hit it off with him.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.200
Well, you're hitting it
off with him.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.066
Oh, no.

12:17.066 --> 12:18.600
Well, maybe we can
save it.

that book.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.467
Well, we only read
the first five pages.

Chopin or Beethoven?

12:58.500 --> 12:59.767
Definitely Beethoven.

You gotta get it together, man,
and get me out of here.

13:47.033 --> 13:50.400
We have to burn
this house to the ground.

13:50.433 --> 13:51.767
- What?
- We have to

empty.

Wait. Oh, no!

14:04.700 --> 14:08.033
Whoa! That is a mystery
you do not wanna solve.

14:08.033 --> 14:09.567

to that story.

Charlotte being a year old.

she was this tiny little nugget,

14:16.700 --> 14:21.166
and now she's up and, like,
experiencing life, you know?

14:21.166 --> 14:23.133
It's just so amazing.

And her smile--
oh, my God, her smile,
