11:30.314 --> 11:35.152

32:50.927 --> 32:51.928
- You want me to get
all aggressive

32:52.011 --> 32:53.429
in front
of a God damn canvas?

32:53.513 --> 32:54.889
Truth is,
that was a [bleep] tattoo.

32:54.972 --> 32:56.224
- Probably
shouldn't be doing this

32:56.307 --> 32:57.642
in front of the other team.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.852
- I don't give a [bleep],
because they know we know.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.562
And enough of
the bull[bleep], okay?

33:01.646 --> 33:02.897
We're [bleep]
here to do a job,

33:02.980 --> 33:04.440
and I'm not gonna
sit here and [bleep]

33:04.524 --> 33:06.401
just play niceties in front
of everybody all the time.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.653
This is final seven.
People can get pissed or not.

thanks to TeeJ once again,

33:28.214 --> 33:30.091
<i>- What the [bleep]</i>

33:30.174 --> 33:32.135
<i>- It looks like</i>
<i>a blue crusted pizza.</i>

33:32.218 --> 33:34.220
<i>- So the brown</i>
<i>is the continent?</i>

33:34.303 --> 33:35.847
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Brown was the continent.</i>

33:35.930 --> 33:37.306
<i>The blue is the ocean,</i>
<i>so that's the ocean falling</i>

33:37.390 --> 33:38.725
<i>off the Earth right there.</i>

33:38.808 --> 33:40.059
- I swear to God,
I was confused until just now.

33:40.143 --> 33:43.438
- Is any of the red saturated?
- Nope.

33:43.521 --> 33:45.815
- The black in the shield,
is that saturated?

33:45.898 --> 33:49.444
- Hell, no,
but is it worse than Turk's?

33:49.527 --> 33:50.820
<i>- The shape of</i>
<i>the casket's off,</i>

33:50.903 --> 33:52.572
<i>the reflection</i>
<i>of the flame is off.</i>

33:52.655 --> 33:54.282
- I'm just tired of seeing
Turk's color play.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.660
<i>He put grey beside grey</i>
<i>with a purple candle,</i>

33:57.744 --> 33:59.412
<i>then he goes</i>
<i>back over to the face,</i>

33:59.495 --> 34:00.580
<i>and it's grey again.</i>

34:00.663 --> 34:02.373
- I think Turk is
the [bleep] worst tattoo.

34:02.457 --> 34:03.791
- I'm going to tell you this

34:03.875 --> 34:05.293
because I consider me
and you friends.

34:05.376 --> 34:08.045
I personally think that
yours is worse than Turk's,

34:08.129 --> 34:09.839
just based off
saturation issues.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.882
It just wasn't done well.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.510
<i>- The water does look muddy.</i>

34:14.594 --> 34:15.887
<i>The body looks</i>
<i>weird on the cat.</i>

34:15.969 --> 34:17.346
- That's weird, though,
because I have two references

34:17.429 --> 34:20.475
that I showed you both.
Was the photographs jacked?

34:20.558 --> 34:22.143
- But you didn't [bleep]
angle it right.

34:22.226 --> 34:23.686
That's not my fault.

34:23.770 --> 34:27.315
- To do a [bleep]
reflection of a lion face

34:27.398 --> 34:31.235
in moving water in color,
that was [bleep] difficult.

34:31.319 --> 34:32.235
- But I know what Tim Stafford

34:32.320 --> 34:34.655
can do from
the top of that cat.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.491
<i>The bottom does</i>
<i>not reflect the top.</i>

34:36.574 --> 34:40.203
<i>- But the kitten proves that</i>
<i>Tim knows how to tattoo,</i>

34:40.286 --> 34:41.746
he knows what he's doing.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.790
You can't look at any
part of Turk's and say, yeah,

34:43.873 --> 34:45.208
this guy knows what he's doing.

34:45.291 --> 34:49.003
- Okay, Turk needs to go.
Send him the [bleep] home.

34:49.085 --> 34:51.088
- All right,
today we're testing detail,

34:51.172 --> 34:52.380
tattooing reflections.

34:52.465 --> 34:53.841
How'd they do overall?

34:53.925 --> 34:55.051
- We see a lot
of struggles today.

34:55.134 --> 34:56.385
<i>Just looking at Tiffer's,</i>

34:56.469 --> 34:58.846
<i>that is not the Earth</i>
<i>falling apart.</i>

34:58.930 --> 35:00.306
<i>- No.</i>

35:00.389 --> 35:02.099
<i>- Color's not up to the line,</i>
<i>it's not saturated.</i>

35:02.183 --> 35:04.185
This just doesn't
look like him at all.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.353
- Uh-uh.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.771
In the case of Tim,
the point is missed,

35:06.854 --> 35:09.524
<i>'cause the kitten is not</i>
<i>looking in the right direction</i>

35:09.607 --> 35:12.151
<i>and the application</i>
<i>is some of the worst</i>

35:12.235 --> 35:13.861
<i>we've seen from Tim so far.</i>

35:13.945 --> 35:16.572
- Well, when I look at Tim's
color saturation, I can't help

35:16.656 --> 35:18.616
but think of Turk's tattooing.
- Right.

35:18.699 --> 35:20.326
<i>- The problem here</i>
<i>is that it's so muddy</i>

35:20.409 --> 35:21.619
<i>in the background,</i>

35:21.702 --> 35:23.037
<i>and the color play</i>
<i>here is so rough.</i>

35:23.120 --> 35:26.040
{\an3}But that application is
better than Tim's whole tattoo.

35:26.123 --> 35:28.000
- What about Amanda?

35:28.084 --> 35:30.545
<i>She misses the reflection</i>
<i>aspect of this challenge 100%.</i>

35:33.798 --> 35:35.800

a question for you guys.

{\an3}You got guys
who busted their ass

35:38.177 --> 35:39.095
{\an3}and failed trying
to do a reflection.

35:39.178 --> 35:42.765
{\an3}Amanda didn't do
a reflection whatsoever.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.559
So what are we gonna do today?

35:44.642 --> 35:46.060
{\an1}- Challenges like this

35:46.143 --> 35:49.397

35:49.480 --> 35:51.148

35:51.232 --> 35:52.692
- There's no question
I should be in the bottom,

35:52.775 --> 35:54.902
rightfully so.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.279

he draws whatever he wants
