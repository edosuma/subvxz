00:47.345 --> 00:51.371
CRIME OF PASSION

01:11.314 --> 01:13.289
He looked like a turkey!

01:14.098 --> 01:15.953
A turkey with a green tie.

01:17.394 --> 01:18.671
You're pretty when you laugh.

01:18.834 --> 01:20.427
Like a little girl.

01:22.130 --> 01:23.723
A drink perhaps?

01:23.986 --> 01:25.000
With pleasure.

01:25.906 --> 01:26.854
We're stopping?

01:27.026 --> 01:29.481
A break.
We deserve it, don't we?

01:30.994 --> 01:31.855
That's good.

01:34.290 --> 01:37.159
We just need a killer idea
to clinch the deal.

01:38.386 --> 01:41.168
You leave tomorrow.
We still have time.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.981
If we can't think of one,
I'll improvise.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.390
You smell good.

01:45.554 --> 01:47.048
What's your perfume?

01:47.411 --> 01:48.654
I don't wear any.

01:48.850 --> 01:51.087
Not all the time.
Not tonight.

01:51.251 --> 01:52.461
You should.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.630
Relax, Isa.

01:56.114 --> 01:57.805
Your shoulders are knotted.

01:59.154 --> 02:00.681
Can I call you Isa?

02:01.907 --> 02:02.855
No, actually.

02:04.338 --> 02:06.126
Isabelle suits you better.

02:06.290 --> 02:09.607
I know a masseur who works magic.
I'll give you his number.

02:09.777 --> 02:10.761
Bordeaux?

02:10.930 --> 02:12.141
That's fine.

02:13.331 --> 02:15.786
I run at the gym. On a treadmill.

02:16.338 --> 02:18.193
Running blanks everything out.

02:18.610 --> 02:19.854
I forget myself.

02:23.506 --> 02:25.099
It's beautiful here.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.008
Everything's beautiful.

02:31.507 --> 02:32.816
A touch obsessive?

02:33.267 --> 02:34.444
A little.

02:34.706 --> 02:37.456
Conscientious, intelligent, precise.

02:37.619 --> 02:38.731
Precious.

02:38.898 --> 02:40.687
We make a good team.
I'm pleased.

02:40.851 --> 02:42.378
I'm pleased, too.

02:42.546 --> 02:44.302
Your scarf's gorgeous.

02:45.395 --> 02:46.540
It's yours.

02:46.707 --> 02:49.096
No, Christine.
I can't accept it.

02:49.427 --> 02:50.987
Of course you can.

02:51.186 --> 02:52.615
Don't be silly.

02:54.866 --> 02:56.524
It's perfect on you.

03:01.811 --> 03:03.218
It smells of you.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.498
To us!

03:13.267 --> 03:14.412
If you like...

03:14.771 --> 03:15.720
To us!

03:19.027 --> 03:21.394
Why do you need
to forget yourself?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.226
You don't have to answer.

03:27.187 --> 03:28.431
Back to work?

03:34.419 --> 03:35.630
Christine?

03:38.419 --> 03:39.367
Yes?
Isabelle...

03:43.955 --> 03:45.449
Two busy little bees.

03:45.619 --> 03:46.896
Am I interrupting?

03:47.379 --> 03:49.386
I'll come back later
if you want.

03:56.275 --> 03:57.257
Evening, Isabelle.

03:57.651 --> 03:58.928
Good evening, Philippe.

04:04.115 --> 04:06.090
Don't worry,
I'll finish it later.

04:06.259 --> 04:07.568
I have all night.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.299
The front door's locked.
You mind going out the back?

04:12.468 --> 04:13.482
No.

04:15.027 --> 04:17.100
Okay, see you tomorrow.

04:17.427 --> 04:18.572
Goodnight, Philippe.

04:43.540 --> 04:44.750
Daniel?

04:45.492 --> 04:46.604
This is Isabelle.

04:46.772 --> 04:48.179
Sorry to call late.

04:48.436 --> 04:50.607
I'm prepping Christine's Cairo meeting

04:50.772 --> 04:53.325
and I had an idea
that could seal the deal.

04:53.492 --> 04:54.670
Remember last year,

04:54.836 --> 04:57.486
how we won
the Philippines soda contract

04:57.651 --> 04:59.790
by bringing in local subcontractors?

05:48.821 --> 05:50.250
Morning, ma'am.

06:16.853 --> 06:17.965
Morning, Jacques.

06:20.820 --> 06:22.446
This weekend?

06:22.709 --> 06:24.115
No, bad timing.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.472
I have a meeting in Cairo.

06:30.676 --> 06:32.586
Promises, promises.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.049
Leave it with me.

06:36.628 --> 06:37.872
I'll call you back.

07:09.589 --> 07:11.563
I found the man for the job.

07:11.733 --> 07:15.508
The go-to guy for a dozen
food industry subcontractors.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.782
Daniel, it'll work.

07:17.621 --> 07:19.344
He's a political big wheel.

07:19.509 --> 07:21.070
Christine can contact him.

07:21.461 --> 07:22.671
I won't tell her,

07:22.837 --> 07:24.747
so she finds out on the plane.

07:24.917 --> 07:27.852
Great idea.
You've gift-wrapped it for her again.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.293
Gift-wrapped it?

07:29.781 --> 07:32.301
It won't be
the first contract she wins

07:32.597 --> 07:33.579
thanks to you.

07:34.197 --> 07:35.691
Her, me, same difference.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.539
And a complete list
of anyone skimming some off.

07:39.701 --> 07:40.595
That's a long list.

07:40.757 --> 07:42.284
Precisely. Time to clean up.

07:42.453 --> 07:43.402
What?

07:43.574 --> 07:44.915
What's scaring you?

07:47.669 --> 07:48.749
Excuse me...

07:49.430 --> 07:50.378
Come in.

07:50.613 --> 07:51.693
We're done.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.781
Puffy eyes. Get any sleep?

07:56.950 --> 07:57.964
A bit.

07:58.262 --> 08:00.628
Our proposal.
I finished it last night.

08:00.790 --> 08:03.507
I think it flies.
You can read it on the plane.

08:04.469 --> 08:05.451
No.

08:06.102 --> 08:07.149
Why not?

08:08.661 --> 08:10.090
You're going to Cairo.

08:10.902 --> 08:13.487
You know the brief.
You'll do a great job.

08:15.542 --> 08:16.490
Honestly?

08:16.950 --> 08:17.811
Honestly.

08:19.573 --> 08:20.686
Thanks, Christine.

08:21.589 --> 08:22.517
Thank you.

08:24.117 --> 08:26.289
You just have time to pack.
Wait!

08:28.757 --> 08:31.179
You should do something with your 
hair.

08:31.350 --> 08:32.364
Let's see it down.

08:40.950 --> 08:41.876
Keep it up.

08:42.582 --> 08:43.792
You're perfect.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.467
Hurry, you'll miss your flight.

08:49.142 --> 08:50.768
Philippe's at the airport.

08:50.933 --> 08:52.843
I asked him to go with you.

08:53.142 --> 08:55.728
His firm worked on this
and he knows Cairo.

08:59.158 --> 09:00.816
Cairo

09:01.878 --> 09:03.536
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:04.214 --> 09:05.458
Thanks very much.

09:09.654 --> 09:12.436
Good job!
Involving the local subcontractors...

09:13.110 --> 09:14.222
Smart move.

09:14.390 --> 09:15.338
Christine's idea?

09:15.510 --> 09:16.655
No, mine.

09:16.822 --> 09:18.764
It occurred to me last night after...

09:19.510 --> 09:21.266
I planned to surprise her.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.837
I'd better call Christine.

09:22.998 --> 09:24.492
Now it's a done deal.

09:24.918 --> 09:27.090
We can fly out tomorrow morning.

09:27.702 --> 09:28.651
Why tomorrow?

09:30.262 --> 09:32.204
Don't you deserve a day off?

09:33.462 --> 09:35.023
Cairo's a beautiful city.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.893
Okay.

09:40.470 --> 09:41.550
We'll stay on.

10:13.783 --> 10:14.765
Well?

10:15.799 --> 10:17.654
When does our tour start?

10:19.958 --> 10:20.907
Right now!

11:21.271 --> 11:23.792
You planned to surprise me, right?

11:26.199 --> 11:27.573
You're shocked?

11:27.863 --> 11:29.903
Me claiming your idea as my own.

11:30.775 --> 11:34.037
You'd have done the same.
At least I hope so.

11:34.391 --> 11:36.813
Want it and watch out.
At all times.

11:36.983 --> 11:38.031
I wanted New York,

11:38.199 --> 11:39.574
but I couldn't count on it.

11:39.736 --> 11:42.037
Thanks to you,
I'll grab my chance.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.988
Grab your chance.
Heard of that?

11:45.719 --> 11:47.541
It's not a betrayal.

11:47.991 --> 11:49.235
It's teamwork.

11:49.399 --> 11:50.828
I believe in you.

11:51.223 --> 11:54.125
You have real talent.
I made the most of it.

11:57.879 --> 11:58.828
Thanks.

12:01.079 --> 12:02.421
So, how was Cairo?

12:02.679 --> 12:04.021
Beautiful, huh?

12:04.343 --> 12:05.750
And with Philippe.

12:06.263 --> 12:07.790
Even more beautiful?

12:36.183 --> 12:38.093
I heard about Washington and Cairo.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.981
Sorry, it's plain wrong.

12:41.144 --> 12:42.191
What's ''wrong''?

12:43.736 --> 12:46.453
Christine fast-tracked to the top,
thanks to you.

12:46.616 --> 12:47.696
So what?

12:47.992 --> 12:48.974
It's great.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.978
Good teamwork
means we all win out.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.688
I succeed if she does.
We complement each other perfectly.

12:57.240 --> 12:58.189
Here...

12:58.424 --> 12:59.569
Take a look.

13:00.023 --> 13:02.129
Market research
the Americans asked for.

13:03.096 --> 13:06.031
A new grain-based food product.
Real potential.

13:06.232 --> 13:09.134
Could take off.
Christine doesn't need to know.

13:10.072 --> 13:11.349
Not yet, at least.

13:23.576 --> 13:26.293
I'm abducting you.
Pick you up in five minutes.

13:26.456 --> 13:28.278
Yes, Christine. Fine.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.094
I bet you were a secretive little 
girl.

13:35.993 --> 13:37.454
I don't know.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.022
Maybe.

13:39.192 --> 13:40.785
Sure. Like you are now.

13:40.952 --> 13:42.610
A real little sphinx.

13:43.577 --> 13:46.097
You know,
I can read sphinxes' minds.

13:48.984 --> 13:50.544
And what do you see?

13:53.560 --> 13:55.535
You didn't like yourself much.

13:58.521 --> 14:00.114
I wanted to be loved.

14:01.305 --> 14:02.996
I wanted to be admired.

14:04.312 --> 14:06.254
It's now I want to be loved.

14:09.337 --> 14:11.988
There's a lipstick in my purse.
Try it.

14:12.217 --> 14:13.908
It'll highlight your eyes.

14:24.185 --> 14:25.395
Perfect.

14:33.017 --> 14:34.991
So? Beautiful, aren't we?

14:40.793 --> 14:41.741
Come on.

14:41.913 --> 14:44.280
I'll teach you to work a room.

14:44.473 --> 14:46.415
It's not your strong point.

14:46.681 --> 14:48.056
But it's very useful.

14:52.344 --> 14:54.417
No, the worst is Siberia.

14:54.873 --> 14:56.815
Unbelievable!
You remember Siberia?

14:57.305 --> 14:58.253
Yes.

14:58.425 --> 14:59.952
That stuff about a shaman

15:00.121 --> 15:01.398
in Siberia, it isn't true?

15:01.561 --> 15:03.350
Never been there. Too cold!

15:04.537 --> 15:06.992
And that fat guy listening

15:07.161 --> 15:09.812
with his mouth gaping
like a dead fish.

15:10.297 --> 15:12.785
800 employees.
600 million in turnover.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.742
The kind of fish I like.

15:15.033 --> 15:16.462
I'll call him next week.

15:16.633 --> 15:17.713
Your turn now.

15:17.881 --> 15:19.375
- My turn?
- See that guy?

15:19.545 --> 15:21.585
Bald, nose in his glass.

15:21.753 --> 15:23.411
That's no fish, that's a shark.

15:23.577 --> 15:24.689
He's bored stupid.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.101
Reel him in.

15:26.585 --> 15:27.960
I don't know how.

15:28.185 --> 15:30.902
I'm not like you,
I can't make up stories.

15:31.257 --> 15:32.467
And I've been drinking.

15:32.633 --> 15:33.778
Good.

15:34.522 --> 15:36.791
Ask him about himself.
Men love that.

15:36.954 --> 15:37.902
Quick touch-up.

15:39.161 --> 15:40.209
Perfect.

15:41.081 --> 15:42.030
Surprise!

15:42.202 --> 15:43.150
Jacques!

15:43.322 --> 15:46.191
Can't get enough of each other.
Awesome!

15:46.361 --> 15:47.790
Same again next weekend?

15:48.058 --> 15:50.513
My helicopter's ready when you are.

15:50.681 --> 15:53.169
My chopper
and all that comes with it.

15:54.265 --> 15:56.021
No Cairo chore
to get out of?

15:56.794 --> 15:58.387
How about Corsica?

15:58.714 --> 16:01.234
What?
No little trooper to send into battle?

16:01.402 --> 16:02.296
Just a second.

16:10.298 --> 16:12.153
I'll be going.
I have a headache.

16:12.441 --> 16:14.351
You're way off. It's not that.

16:15.802 --> 16:17.012
It's not what?

16:17.337 --> 16:18.744
You think that Cairo

16:18.905 --> 16:20.629
was because it suited me.

16:20.794 --> 16:22.103
You're wrong.

16:22.298 --> 16:24.272
I sent you to take my place

16:24.442 --> 16:26.417
because I trust you.

16:27.193 --> 16:29.582
What I got up to doesn't matter.

16:31.385 --> 16:32.814
What does that change?

16:34.746 --> 16:35.793
Stay.

16:40.346 --> 16:42.735
I feel woozy.
I'll call a cab.

16:44.186 --> 16:45.233
Go ahead.

16:47.322 --> 16:48.631
No kiss?

17:36.634 --> 17:38.457
Did Christine ever come to yours?

17:39.706 --> 17:40.917
Ever come here?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.500
You sure you want to talk about her?

17:49.658 --> 17:51.087
What's it like with her?

17:51.995 --> 17:53.424
It turns you on.

17:54.523 --> 17:55.570
You surprise me.

17:58.523 --> 17:59.832
What's it like?

18:00.539 --> 18:02.262
She thinks only of herself.

18:02.555 --> 18:03.700
In bed, too.

18:07.707 --> 18:09.233
She knows. You told her?

18:09.402 --> 18:11.475
Cut it out!
Forget Christine.

18:15.514 --> 18:16.823
She wanted it.

18:23.419 --> 18:24.596
You can't get enough.

18:24.762 --> 18:26.585
Not with you.

18:28.987 --> 18:31.704
What's she like
when you make her come?

18:35.163 --> 18:37.432
I think that's about it.
Any questions?

18:42.203 --> 18:43.959
I got a memo from head office.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.319
Market research that Washington sent.
You have it?

18:48.123 --> 18:50.195
It's a pretty vague project so far,

18:50.363 --> 18:52.119
on the back burner.

18:52.347 --> 18:54.201
Keep me in the loop.

18:54.363 --> 18:55.476
Of course.

18:56.347 --> 18:58.551
That's all. Thanks, everybody.

19:04.827 --> 19:06.201
Do you have a minute?

19:07.419 --> 19:08.367
Yes.

19:12.635 --> 19:15.984
My scarf suits you.
I'm glad to see you wearing it.

19:24.124 --> 19:26.098
You're mad at me about Cairo.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.241
- No.
- You are.

19:30.395 --> 19:31.639
You're mad at me.

19:32.827 --> 19:34.289
And I can't stand it.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.616
I love you, Isabelle.

19:39.963 --> 19:41.458
I really love you.

19:48.124 --> 19:49.139
And you?

19:50.875 --> 19:52.370
Me too. You know that.

19:52.668 --> 19:54.195
No, I don't know that.

19:55.484 --> 19:57.272
You think I never have doubts?

19:58.524 --> 20:00.979
I need to be told,
I need to hear it.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.472
I opened up to you in the car.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.771
I never told anyone that.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.441
I shouldn't have.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.774
You see?

20:19.740 --> 20:22.587
You can't bring yourself
to tell me, I love you.

20:27.836 --> 20:29.560
I love you, Christine.

20:36.188 --> 20:37.431
Come in, Philippe.

20:39.388 --> 20:41.079
You asked for me.
Here I am.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.715
You're both very complicated.

20:45.884 --> 20:47.891
Back to business then.

20:48.060 --> 20:50.842
Leave us, please.
I need a word with Philippe.

20:57.884 --> 20:58.833
So...

21:00.156 --> 21:01.618
How do you intend

21:01.788 --> 21:04.691
to make amends
for your financial chicanery?

21:06.237 --> 21:07.513
I told you.

21:08.444 --> 21:10.266
Give me 2-3 months
to balance up

21:10.844 --> 21:12.305
and everything's dandy.

21:12.796 --> 21:14.389
You have 1 week, max.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.138
You're insane!

21:18.556 --> 21:19.505
That's impossible.

21:19.677 --> 21:22.230
I said I'd cover you
for a limited period.

21:22.397 --> 21:23.803
Time's running out.

21:24.125 --> 21:27.802
Washington's sniffing around.
I refuse to be exposed.

21:28.317 --> 21:29.626
Hold on...

21:30.429 --> 21:33.560
My firm's worked for you so long,
where's the trust?

21:33.725 --> 21:36.059
I prepared an annex,
dated today.

21:36.445 --> 21:38.135
I'll add it to the report.

21:38.556 --> 21:40.280
You can read it if you want.

21:44.796 --> 21:46.585
I need to protect myself.

21:52.988 --> 21:54.876
If anyone reads this, I'm dead.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.555
Pay it back and I tear it up.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.078
Don't do this to me.

22:07.740 --> 22:09.563
You think I'm stupid.

22:12.028 --> 22:14.843
Philippe, I need to see you...

22:20.668 --> 22:22.840
You know I have a mole
in Washington...

22:23.517 --> 22:24.924
Yes, and?

22:25.116 --> 22:28.499
He told me the new product
will be okayed next week.

22:32.796 --> 22:36.593
If we start work, discreetly,
we'll be ready for the green light.

22:36.957 --> 22:39.575
This time,
Washington will know who did what.

22:41.949 --> 22:43.061
We'll see.

22:44.957 --> 22:48.602
... before you go.
Call me. Isa.

22:48.797 --> 22:49.877
Send.

23:00.797 --> 23:01.812
Fuck it!

23:05.149 --> 23:06.676
You didn't get my text?

23:06.909 --> 23:08.218
Sure I did.

23:09.437 --> 23:11.063
This isn't a good time, see?

23:11.261 --> 23:12.690
A good time for what?

23:18.141 --> 23:19.548
I have problems.

23:20.189 --> 23:21.301
Big problems.

23:22.365 --> 23:23.707
Tell me.

23:23.901 --> 23:25.462
I'm here.
I can help you.

23:25.949 --> 23:26.876
Listen...

23:27.550 --> 23:28.760
We've got to stop.

23:29.949 --> 23:31.029
Stop what?

23:31.517 --> 23:32.466
Us.

23:32.862 --> 23:34.291
You and me. Stop.

23:34.845 --> 23:35.739
It's best.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.946
Is it Christine?

23:43.070 --> 23:45.753
- She wants us to stop?
- It's not Christine.

23:46.206 --> 23:47.351
I don't believe you.

23:48.830 --> 23:50.357
I'm sure it's Christine.

23:50.846 --> 23:52.439
- Tell me...
- You don't get it!

23:52.637 --> 23:54.579
She doesn't care about us!

23:54.782 --> 23:57.270
Get it?
She doesn't give a damn!

23:57.789 --> 23:59.164
We don't exist for her.

23:59.357 --> 24:00.306
You don't...

24:00.509 --> 24:01.437
I don't!

24:54.782 --> 24:56.953
This new product,
great potential.

24:58.526 --> 24:59.835
I've had some ideas.

25:00.990 --> 25:02.037
I'm sure you have.

25:24.446 --> 25:26.039
I did the last checks.

25:26.239 --> 25:28.660
It'll be in Washington
when they arrive.

25:29.502 --> 25:32.317
48 hours before
Christine's activity report.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.987
Well done, darling, it's great.

25:40.031 --> 25:41.460
You know my taste.

25:43.038 --> 25:44.532
It's not too noisy?

25:44.798 --> 25:45.726
You're sure?

25:47.199 --> 25:48.628
How much again?

25:51.839 --> 25:53.562
New York's so expensive.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.096
I'll take it.

25:56.159 --> 25:57.468
Happy?

25:57.663 --> 25:59.638
Sure, I'm happy.

26:08.350 --> 26:10.041
Over there, it's only 3 pm.

26:10.879 --> 26:12.439
Give them time to read it.

26:48.767 --> 26:49.715
First set...

26:49.887 --> 26:50.835
to us!

26:53.343 --> 26:55.831
They basically like it,
want to test our sources

26:56.032 --> 26:57.886
and move very, very fast.

26:58.079 --> 26:59.639
It's all good.

27:05.503 --> 27:06.452
Daniel?

27:07.871 --> 27:08.819
Yes?

27:09.631 --> 27:11.005
The report...

27:11.840 --> 27:13.912
I can't not mention it
to Christine.

27:14.368 --> 27:15.742
Before it's too late.

27:16.032 --> 27:18.519
You know what she'll do.
Same as always.

27:20.992 --> 27:21.919
Look...

27:23.008 --> 27:25.080
That's how it is.
I can't change it.

27:25.280 --> 27:26.709
I'll tell her tomorrow.

27:27.743 --> 27:28.692
Pity.

28:23.232 --> 28:24.956
Christine Riviere's voicemail.

28:25.152 --> 28:27.356
Leave a message after the beep.

30:23.233 --> 30:24.313
Why, Isabelle?

30:30.913 --> 30:32.539
You were in the loop.

30:32.993 --> 30:34.303
You never asked about it.

30:35.105 --> 30:36.632
It all went so fast.

30:36.961 --> 30:39.863
I was going to tell you today.
I called you last night.

30:40.289 --> 30:41.499
They beat me to it.

30:41.729 --> 30:43.901
Answer my question.
Why?

30:44.673 --> 30:45.655
Why what?

30:48.193 --> 30:49.884
''Want it and watch out.''

30:50.433 --> 30:51.742
I listened to you.

30:51.873 --> 30:52.822
I observed you.

30:52.993 --> 30:54.848
I learned to act like you.

30:55.905 --> 30:57.115
You learned nothing.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.899
You don't get it.
You've ruined everything.

31:03.169 --> 31:04.827
You ruined everything.

31:09.889 --> 31:11.099
There we are.

31:12.769 --> 31:14.842
The answer to my question.

32:16.226 --> 32:17.175
Yes?

32:18.626 --> 32:19.836
It's me.

32:25.122 --> 32:26.845
You were right.
It's Christine.

32:28.290 --> 32:29.916
She forced me to break up.

32:32.962 --> 32:34.304
She forced you?

32:35.106 --> 32:36.448
Yes, forced.

32:38.307 --> 32:39.517
She frightens me.

32:40.386 --> 32:41.913
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

32:43.362 --> 32:46.362
She enjoys playing with you,
destroying you.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.304
She did it with me.

32:50.082 --> 32:51.576
You too now.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.199
I want to see you, Isa.

32:54.914 --> 32:56.158
I need you.

32:57.666 --> 32:59.389
I want to be with you.

32:59.971 --> 33:01.116
If you want me.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.580
I don't know.

33:09.731 --> 33:11.007
I don't know if I do.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.143
I need you.

33:15.683 --> 33:16.631
To love you.

33:19.202 --> 33:21.821
Tonight?
I'll pick you up if you want.

33:22.274 --> 33:23.703
Late. Around 8 pm.

33:24.450 --> 33:25.595
Okay?

33:28.355 --> 33:29.282
Isa?

33:29.987 --> 33:31.034
Okay.

33:31.651 --> 33:33.506
Tonight at 8. Here.

34:30.915 --> 34:33.184
No, it's not Philippe. It's me.

34:34.212 --> 34:36.545
The woman who plays with you,
destroys you.

34:36.771 --> 34:37.819
Nice line, huh?

34:38.786 --> 34:40.675
I have to say,
with you it's easy.

34:40.995 --> 34:43.962
Poor Isabelle,
all dressed up, I bet.

34:44.164 --> 34:45.887
Only wants to be loved.

34:46.402 --> 34:47.514
Perfume tonight?

34:47.715 --> 34:48.991
Just a bit too much.

34:49.891 --> 34:51.484
Go home now.

34:51.875 --> 34:53.664
What happens now
is up to you.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.801
Nobody's irreplaceable.

36:10.596 --> 36:12.352
- Thursday at 8.
- That should be fine.

36:12.548 --> 36:14.074
Next week, I'm in Germany.

36:14.276 --> 36:15.901
- With Bertrand?
- Yes, Bertrand.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.309
Meeting the Czechs.

36:18.372 --> 36:19.320
When are you back?

36:19.524 --> 36:20.931
Wednesday evening.

36:25.284 --> 36:27.520
What a little trooper!

36:41.956 --> 36:44.509
Sorry to interrupt.
I've noticed something weird.

36:48.357 --> 36:50.626
Looking through the files

36:50.789 --> 36:52.512
of an operation earlier this year,

36:52.709 --> 36:54.203
I saw a massive difference

36:54.373 --> 36:56.282
between the actual budget

36:56.485 --> 36:58.754
and Philippe Deschamps'
firm's estimate.

36:59.908 --> 37:02.396
Maybe it's just an accounting ploy.

37:02.724 --> 37:05.724
What's weird
is that Christine just added an annex,

37:05.956 --> 37:07.330
a kind of ultimatum,

37:07.524 --> 37:09.280
covering herself against Philippe.

37:13.157 --> 37:14.105
Are you okay?

37:21.285 --> 37:24.002
You get the message?
Christine's organized a party

37:24.196 --> 37:25.658
for all senior execs.

37:25.893 --> 37:27.071
Saturday night.

37:28.036 --> 37:31.811
Yes, I know,
but it'll look bad not to be there.

37:45.477 --> 37:46.721
My friends!

37:46.917 --> 37:50.845
We've prepared a surprise.
For your amusement, I hope.

37:51.493 --> 37:54.689
A quick documentary.
A life lesson, if you like.

37:54.885 --> 37:57.307
The theme is,
executives and their toys,

37:57.509 --> 37:59.581
heartbreak and pleasure.

38:01.957 --> 38:03.844
Here we see the executive

38:04.037 --> 38:06.525
trying to save the toy.

38:09.669 --> 38:12.386
A proper little Good Samaritan.

38:14.245 --> 38:17.115
Before joining the firm,
you wanted to be a doctor?

38:17.637 --> 38:19.972
- Yes.
- I read it in your file.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.532
The marital crisis.
We've all been there.

38:22.725 --> 38:24.613
Just forgive and forget.

38:31.013 --> 38:33.599
Isabelle talks to the elevator.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.985
Isabelle doesn't like her parking.

38:40.326 --> 38:43.806
Isabelle tries to out-scream her 
alarm.

38:45.734 --> 38:48.451
Isabelle argues with a concrete 
pillar.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.768
You can't win every time.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.619
Know your limits.

38:55.526 --> 38:57.249
It's just a laugh.

38:58.117 --> 38:59.972
Show us your sense of humour.

39:00.390 --> 39:01.568
Like the others.

39:04.837 --> 39:07.226
Isabelle the tragic heroine.

39:11.334 --> 39:13.505
I see why you need
to forget yourself.

39:13.733 --> 39:15.555
Stick to the treadmill.

39:15.750 --> 39:18.238
The real Isabelle
is in that car park.

39:18.437 --> 39:20.030
The other one doesn't exist.

39:20.326 --> 39:22.213
It was just a bad act.

39:22.406 --> 39:25.089
She had me fooled a moment,
but I was wrong.

39:25.413 --> 39:27.072
Get over it.

39:27.270 --> 39:28.699
You were born that way.

40:04.038 --> 40:07.038
Hurry, Christine brought forward
the Monday heads-up.

40:07.078 --> 40:08.027
It's started.

40:08.358 --> 40:09.470
Coming.

40:54.631 --> 40:55.973
I need a word.

40:58.118 --> 40:59.427
Take a seat.

41:11.847 --> 41:13.635
I'll never forget what you did.

41:13.831 --> 41:15.904
I'll make you pay
one way or another.

41:19.046 --> 41:22.243
- I didn't write this.
- It came from your computer?

41:24.711 --> 41:26.085
I didn't write it.

41:28.134 --> 41:30.371
After your reaction Saturday evening,

41:30.566 --> 41:33.469
who else would write
such grotesque threats?

41:36.166 --> 41:38.370
I didn't write it, period.

41:39.495 --> 41:40.640
The first lapse,

41:40.935 --> 41:42.723
the first slip-up in your work,

41:42.919 --> 41:45.156
and I will use it to fire you.
Got it?

41:46.439 --> 41:47.387
Go on.

42:19.591 --> 42:23.236
This is Isabelle Guerin.
Could I speak to Dr. Fabre, please?

42:26.727 --> 42:27.840
Pierre?

42:28.552 --> 42:29.981
This is Isabelle.

42:30.311 --> 42:31.718
Can I come by?

42:33.608 --> 42:34.852
I'll be right there.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.013
Daniel?

43:11.176 --> 43:12.069
The file you mentioned

43:12.296 --> 43:15.198
with Philippe Deschamps'
budget estimate...

43:15.399 --> 43:16.926
- You still have it?
- Yes.

43:34.855 --> 43:35.749
Thanks.

45:14.889 --> 45:15.838
Here...

45:16.008 --> 45:18.910
Don't archive it just yet.
Hold onto it.

45:19.113 --> 45:20.323
Sure.

45:20.489 --> 45:21.569
Christine wants you.

45:22.313 --> 45:23.720
For the Japanese deal.

45:23.913 --> 45:27.044
They want a souvenir photo
with our two top execs.

45:27.273 --> 45:28.800
You know what they're like.

45:33.257 --> 45:34.369
Tell her I'm coming.

46:49.674 --> 46:50.754
What are you doing?

46:51.209 --> 46:52.453
Taking the train?

46:54.570 --> 46:55.431
Where's your car?

46:56.009 --> 46:57.122
Repairs.

46:58.121 --> 47:01.252
This is stupid, it's pouring.
I'll drop you at the office.

47:13.737 --> 47:14.915
Look...

47:15.594 --> 47:17.416
One day, I'll explain.

47:18.698 --> 47:20.454
I know it was unforgiveable.

47:21.642 --> 47:23.016
But I was in a bind.

47:24.041 --> 47:25.350
You have no idea.

47:26.282 --> 47:28.322
Did I leave my scarf at yours?

47:30.282 --> 47:31.558
No, I'd have seen it.

47:32.042 --> 47:34.463
I must have lost it. Shoot.

48:02.410 --> 48:04.647
- She's popping pills now?
- Yeah.

48:05.930 --> 48:07.424
And that stuff's poison.

48:08.395 --> 48:10.085
I thought she was tough but...

48:10.282 --> 48:12.038
You remember her predecessor?

48:12.235 --> 48:13.249
Elena?

48:13.578 --> 48:14.756
Know where she wound up?

48:14.954 --> 48:16.002
Mental hospital.

48:16.202 --> 48:17.479
Nervous breakdown.

48:23.082 --> 48:25.897
My place, Saturday.
A dozen of us, no more.

49:13.931 --> 49:14.913
I look forward to it.
Hi, sweets.

49:16.075 --> 49:17.416
Hey, sis.

49:18.475 --> 49:20.548
That was fast.
Barely 90 minutes.

49:21.418 --> 49:22.531
Your hair looks good.

49:24.459 --> 49:26.247
Claudine, I missed you.

49:27.083 --> 49:28.326
It's great to see you,

49:28.523 --> 49:30.279
the house and everything.

49:33.515 --> 49:34.530
You're so heavy!

49:34.731 --> 49:37.098
I'm top of the class
in French and Art.

49:37.355 --> 49:39.078
Why don't you ever visit?

49:39.275 --> 49:41.828
Your aunt works even harder than you.

49:42.731 --> 49:43.713
Come on in.

49:45.099 --> 49:46.888
You're a real kitty-cat.

49:47.211 --> 49:48.553
Do you purr?

49:49.195 --> 49:50.144
Denis is at work?

49:50.316 --> 49:52.836
He gets home soon.
Can you wait for dinner?

49:53.163 --> 49:54.952
Sure. I have plenty of time.

49:55.179 --> 49:56.226
Really?

49:57.355 --> 49:59.046
Something's going down.

50:00.299 --> 50:02.307
In my car, on the backseat,

50:02.540 --> 50:04.514
there's a big parcel.
Can you get it?

50:04.716 --> 50:06.242
Quickly!

50:12.940 --> 50:13.922
Upstairs?

50:14.923 --> 50:16.679
She's a wonderful little girl.

50:18.571 --> 50:21.254
I like picturing her here, in my room.

50:22.315 --> 50:23.809
It feels so good.

50:27.179 --> 50:28.870
Are you happy with Denis?

50:29.835 --> 50:31.362
I'm very happy.

50:31.915 --> 50:32.963
What about you?

50:36.363 --> 50:38.371
Same old. Always ends badly.

50:41.132 --> 50:42.920
Last time was the worst.

50:47.756 --> 50:48.934
So embarrassing.

50:51.692 --> 50:53.285
I could have died.

50:59.116 --> 51:00.294
I mess up.

51:00.492 --> 51:01.921
I mess up every time.

51:08.460 --> 51:10.794
A nice little husband...

51:11.500 --> 51:13.442
a nice little girl...

51:14.060 --> 51:15.848
a nice little life...

51:16.140 --> 51:17.995
Maybe I'm not cut out for it.

51:22.060 --> 51:23.107
Sorry...

51:26.604 --> 51:28.677
I didn't mean it like that.

51:33.484 --> 51:34.564
Do you love me?

51:37.292 --> 51:39.364
Of course I love you.

51:39.660 --> 51:41.285
All three of us love you.

51:53.932 --> 51:55.874
Tell me. What's wrong?

51:58.860 --> 52:01.478
No money, please.
You give us enough already.

52:01.677 --> 52:02.920
It's not that.

52:04.492 --> 52:06.281
Can you do something for me?

52:06.477 --> 52:10.251
But you have to swear
never to tell anyone. Ever.

52:11.116 --> 52:13.156
You asking me for help
for once...

52:15.596 --> 52:16.971
I swear.

54:14.862 --> 54:18.123
- I told you, the Americans...
- Bullshit! That's not it.

54:19.533 --> 54:21.638
All clean and tidy.
If that's all...

54:21.838 --> 54:23.976
That's great, Eliane. Thank you.

54:24.302 --> 54:25.250
Goodnight.

54:25.997 --> 54:27.110
See you Monday.

54:27.694 --> 54:28.555
No more, okay!

54:33.454 --> 54:35.276
- Cut the crap!
- Enough!

58:39.056 --> 58:40.397
Daniel?

58:41.776 --> 58:43.117
I don't feel well.

58:43.504 --> 58:45.260
I won't be in today.

58:47.567 --> 58:49.804
Why? What do they want?

58:51.663 --> 58:52.711
Really?

58:53.296 --> 58:54.605
Is it serious?

58:57.584 --> 58:59.820
I'll touch base later.

59:01.200 --> 59:03.917
I need to get some sleep.
Don't call me.

01:00:22.224 --> 01:00:23.817
Miss Isabelle Guerin?

01:00:27.185 --> 01:00:28.133
Yes.

01:00:29.265 --> 01:00:30.280
May I?

01:00:31.537 --> 01:00:32.485
Yes.

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:38.248
Are you okay?

01:00:38.449 --> 01:00:39.343
No.

01:00:39.696 --> 01:00:42.631
I just took some sleeping pills.
I haven't slept.

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:52.783
You know Christine Riviere
has been killed?

01:00:53.841 --> 01:00:56.361
Stabbed 3 times.
Her house, Saturday night.

01:00:59.537 --> 01:01:00.617
I didn't know.

01:01:08.305 --> 01:01:10.247
You weren't on good terms,
I believe?

01:01:12.497 --> 01:01:14.122
Work issues.

01:01:15.441 --> 01:01:18.092
And there was a party last week...

01:01:25.362 --> 01:01:27.369
Why aren't you at work today?

01:01:31.089 --> 01:01:32.649
I don't feel well.

01:01:34.065 --> 01:01:35.494
I'm sleeping badly.

01:01:35.729 --> 01:01:36.809
Serious shit!

01:01:37.905 --> 01:01:39.814
You take many of these?

01:01:41.426 --> 01:01:42.473
Right now, yes.

01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:47.274
You have to come with us.

01:01:52.305 --> 01:01:54.312
- Why?
- Please.

01:01:54.962 --> 01:01:55.976
Get dressed.

01:02:05.362 --> 01:02:06.606
We'll help you.

01:02:10.322 --> 01:02:11.369
Thank you.

01:02:17.969 --> 01:02:20.457
These threats came from your computer.

01:02:22.898 --> 01:02:25.767
Your relationship with the victim
was very tense.

01:02:26.386 --> 01:02:29.582
Recently, she completely humiliated 
you
in public.

01:02:29.937 --> 01:02:30.886
Didn't she?

01:02:33.681 --> 01:02:34.609
The victim

01:02:35.026 --> 01:02:37.033
managed to write ''Isa''

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:38.951
with her own blood.

01:02:41.586 --> 01:02:45.198
Earlier, you seemed to be hiding
scratches on your arm.

01:02:45.746 --> 01:02:46.640
Lastly,

01:02:46.898 --> 01:02:49.932
she was clutching a scrap of fabric

01:02:50.418 --> 01:02:53.135
that seems to be
from an identical scarf

01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:55.882
to the one you're wearing here.

01:03:04.562 --> 01:03:06.569
Now, I have a question for you.

01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:08.363
A very important question.

01:03:09.298 --> 01:03:10.923
Listen
and think carefully

01:03:11.506 --> 01:03:13.448
before replying.

01:03:15.346 --> 01:03:17.801
Where were you Saturday night

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:20.817
between 1 1 pm
and half past midnight?

01:03:28.626 --> 01:03:29.903
At the movies.

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:31.407
Alone?

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:34.758
Yes.

01:03:35.698 --> 01:03:37.608
Anybody see you? Recognize you?

01:03:42.706 --> 01:03:44.233
Why'd anyone recognize me?

01:03:45.523 --> 01:03:48.719
Sometimes you talk to people
and they remember later.

01:03:48.947 --> 01:03:50.256
Remember what?

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:52.654
Meeting you.
Then you have an alibi.

01:03:53.043 --> 01:03:55.432
You couldn't have killed
Christine Riviere.

01:03:58.322 --> 01:04:00.144
Killed Christine?

01:04:01.267 --> 01:04:02.215
No...

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:06.473
I met no one.
I talked to no one.

01:04:10.163 --> 01:04:11.919
You didn't keep your ticket?

01:04:13.778 --> 01:04:14.640
No.

01:04:15.123 --> 01:04:16.050
What for?
I'll call the boss.

01:04:21.202 --> 01:04:23.439
I won't be long.

01:04:29.107 --> 01:04:30.536
Don't go to sleep.

01:04:30.963 --> 01:04:33.134
Try to keep a clear head.

01:04:35.346 --> 01:04:38.129
Mind you, with all you take,
uppers and downers,

01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.200
hell of a cocktail!

01:04:40.979 --> 01:04:42.440
I need them.

01:04:42.643 --> 01:04:44.399
You might have a problem there.

01:04:44.627 --> 01:04:45.772
If you need them.

01:04:49.107 --> 01:04:50.765
The boss has made his decision.

01:04:52.243 --> 01:04:54.632
As of today, 5:30 pm,
you're in custody.

01:04:55.187 --> 01:04:58.449
You'll be notified of your rights
in due course.

01:04:59.379 --> 01:05:01.965
If you have a lawyer,
time to make a call.

01:05:18.067 --> 01:05:19.660
I can't sleep.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.452
Isabelle Guerin!

01:05:56.691 --> 01:05:58.960
There are the scratches on your arm...

01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:03.274
And tests prove the scrap of fabric...

01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:06.925
comes from your scarf.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.875
Therefore, I confirm you're under 
arrest
and will be held in custody.

01:06:18.964 --> 01:06:20.076
It'll be okay.

01:06:23.444 --> 01:06:24.491
Miss...

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.078
You must be intelligent,
given your qualifications

01:06:28.308 --> 01:06:30.959
and position in your company.

01:06:32.084 --> 01:06:34.451
You knew you'd be the prime suspect,

01:06:34.643 --> 01:06:36.399
the most likely culprit.

01:06:46.964 --> 01:06:49.353
Shall we take a break?
You need a doctor?

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:51.083
I agree. My client...

01:06:51.284 --> 01:06:52.232
Sorry?

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:56.393
No?

01:06:57.588 --> 01:06:58.864
We'll go fast then.

01:07:00.628 --> 01:07:02.603
By staging the crime scene

01:07:02.804 --> 01:07:06.219
to accuse a supposed prowler,
you aggravated your crime

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.809
through cold premeditation.

01:07:09.844 --> 01:07:11.568
I recommend
you confess immediately.

01:07:11.764 --> 01:07:14.001
It'll save us all a lot of trouble.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.817
- My client is not in a...
- Miss Guerin.

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:23.721
Did you kill
Christine Riviere?

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:31.853
Was it you?

01:07:38.389 --> 01:07:39.599
I think so.

01:07:40.084 --> 01:07:42.091
Careful.
Think what you're saying.

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:43.404
What do you mean?

01:07:44.724 --> 01:07:45.968
You ''think so''?

01:07:51.764 --> 01:07:52.844
Do you confess?

01:07:55.188 --> 01:07:57.043
That's right, I confess.

01:07:59.028 --> 01:08:01.167
Will they leave me alone now?

01:08:01.365 --> 01:08:02.739
I don't feel well.

01:08:03.605 --> 01:08:05.994
First, sign your statement
and confession.

01:08:06.229 --> 01:08:07.985
I must emphasize
that my client's...

01:08:08.181 --> 01:08:10.636
Your client has confessed her crime.

01:08:11.573 --> 01:08:14.060
Her confession goes in the file.

01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:21.482
My medication...
Can I have my medication now?

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.045
Go ahead.

01:09:22.965 --> 01:09:25.835
Young woman suspected
of murdering her boss

01:09:49.621 --> 01:09:52.304
Miss, do you recognize this person?

01:09:52.564 --> 01:09:53.514
Perfectly.

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:56.051
She wanted a carving knife.

01:09:56.566 --> 01:09:59.664
She was so nasty
I can't forget her.

01:10:00.214 --> 01:10:02.548
It's rarely as bad as she was.

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.653
Show me your carving knives.

01:10:05.845 --> 01:10:06.773
Good morning.

01:10:06.965 --> 01:10:10.162
Don't get smart.
I'm a customer, not your friend.

01:10:14.902 --> 01:10:15.884
No good.

01:10:16.053 --> 01:10:18.061
I want a knife

01:10:18.262 --> 01:10:21.524
with a black handle
and a blade like that.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:22.928
A good knife.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:24.718
Do yourjob, will you.

01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:28.531
ThereI

01:10:29.014 --> 01:10:30.061
That one.

01:10:30.901 --> 01:10:34.578
If you'd listened,
you wouldn't have wasted my time.

01:10:37.686 --> 01:10:38.930
Miss Guerin?

01:10:41.622 --> 01:10:43.215
Did you buy this knife?

01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:47.569
- You don't have to answer.
- Counsel!

01:10:47.766 --> 01:10:49.490
Your client has confessed.

01:10:49.686 --> 01:10:51.377
We're beyond all that.

01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:55.188
Yes, I bought a knife but...

01:10:59.734 --> 01:11:00.879
I'm listening.

01:11:04.822 --> 01:11:06.927
You admit you bought this knife.

01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:10.288
The knife that became the murder 
weapon.

01:11:11.222 --> 01:11:13.840
We're done here.
Thank you, miss, that's all.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.564
My pleasure, sir.

01:11:15.767 --> 01:11:17.196
Any time.

01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.923
You shouldn't have come.

01:12:01.654 --> 01:12:03.116
I love you, Isabelle.

01:12:03.703 --> 01:12:06.158
I can understand anything,
but this...

01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:07.406
I'm sorry.

01:12:12.535 --> 01:12:13.582
I love you, too.

01:12:15.287 --> 01:12:17.011
Don't forget what I asked.

01:12:17.175 --> 01:12:19.564
That's all you have to do.
Nothing else.

01:13:03.415 --> 01:13:04.364
What is it?

01:13:04.535 --> 01:13:06.128
I want to see my lawyer.

01:13:09.655 --> 01:13:10.702
It wasn't me.

01:13:11.127 --> 01:13:12.556
I didn't kill Christine.

01:13:14.231 --> 01:13:16.020
- You retract?
- Yes.

01:13:16.312 --> 01:13:17.970
I'm innocent of all charges.

01:13:19.192 --> 01:13:20.369
Why did you confess?

01:13:22.488 --> 01:13:23.568
I don't know.

01:13:25.143 --> 01:13:26.572
Overmedicated.

01:13:27.415 --> 01:13:28.877
I wanted it all to stop.

01:13:29.111 --> 01:13:31.828
I was so tired.
It all seemed so strange.

01:13:33.015 --> 01:13:34.903
And now it's not so strange?

01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:39.350
I'm off the sedatives now.

01:13:40.887 --> 01:13:43.702
In prison,
I realized what was happening to me.

01:13:46.008 --> 01:13:47.862
I'll ask them to see you.

01:13:48.856 --> 01:13:50.547
I feel much better now!

01:13:52.696 --> 01:13:55.216
Yes, I know,
I have a scarf like that.

01:13:55.704 --> 01:13:57.198
I think I lost it somewhere.

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.220
I didn't really look at home.

01:13:59.416 --> 01:14:01.936
We searched your house
and found nothing.

01:14:02.615 --> 01:14:06.292
You're generally very tidy,
but you ''think'' you lost it?

01:14:06.807 --> 01:14:08.630
Allow me to doubt that.

01:14:09.656 --> 01:14:13.136
You could have got rid of it
when you saw it was torn

01:14:13.336 --> 01:14:14.961
and pointed to your guilt.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:17.747
I lose things,
like everybody else.

01:14:18.456 --> 01:14:20.082
You need to look harder.

01:14:20.695 --> 01:14:23.248
You could undertake another search.

01:14:23.448 --> 01:14:25.488
My client has no reason to lie.

01:14:25.688 --> 01:14:28.241
She has a scarf like that,
or she doesn't.

01:14:57.176 --> 01:14:58.124
Well?

01:14:58.489 --> 01:14:59.416
Nothing.

01:15:00.056 --> 01:15:01.332
And the knife?

01:15:01.976 --> 01:15:04.245
I did buy a knife like that,

01:15:05.272 --> 01:15:06.701
but I broke it next day.

01:15:06.904 --> 01:15:09.326
I forget what I did with it.

01:15:10.553 --> 01:15:11.567
Sure.

01:15:37.945 --> 01:15:40.366
After searching all day,
the police found

01:15:40.569 --> 01:15:43.984
no trace of the knife
Isabelle Guerin claims to have broken,

01:15:44.184 --> 01:15:45.843
which could have helped prove

01:15:46.073 --> 01:15:47.382
that she didn't...

01:15:50.553 --> 01:15:51.862
It wasn't me.

01:15:55.192 --> 01:15:56.981
Why would I do a thing like that?

01:15:57.177 --> 01:15:58.606
You alone have a motive.

01:15:58.872 --> 01:16:01.109
A powerful motive. Revenge.

01:16:01.304 --> 01:16:04.239
I've seen
how far humiliation drives people.

01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:08.024
I never wrote that email!

01:16:08.857 --> 01:16:12.981
Why would I do something so horrible
if I'd written that?

01:16:13.177 --> 01:16:14.322
I'd have been nuts.

01:16:18.265 --> 01:16:21.975
Christine sent it to herself,
from my computer.

01:16:22.616 --> 01:16:25.366
My career was taking off.
She resented it.

01:16:25.785 --> 01:16:27.192
She was at war with me.

01:16:27.513 --> 01:16:29.172
A war of attrition. Hatred.

01:16:29.369 --> 01:16:31.257
We have statements from witnesses,

01:16:31.449 --> 01:16:32.693
who all confirm

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:36.402
that my client was shaken
by her boss's harassment.

01:16:36.633 --> 01:16:38.705
She was depressed,
taking a lot of pills.

01:16:38.905 --> 01:16:41.938
That proves nothing.
Just the opposite, in fact.

01:16:42.873 --> 01:16:45.972
Nothing you say
is supported by the evidence.

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:48.209
It points to you,
but you're innocent?

01:16:51.737 --> 01:16:53.974
I remain convinced of your guilt.

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:14.704
What is it?

01:17:14.873 --> 01:17:15.888
Somebody, help me.

01:17:16.314 --> 01:17:17.328
Help me.

01:17:19.417 --> 01:17:21.010
What's going on?

01:17:22.713 --> 01:17:23.761
Calm down.

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:25.488
Breathe in.

01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:27.189
Slowly, deeply.

01:17:27.386 --> 01:17:28.662
With me.

01:17:29.498 --> 01:17:30.774
In...

01:17:31.834 --> 01:17:32.979
Out...

01:17:38.073 --> 01:17:40.048
That's right, like that.

01:17:40.314 --> 01:17:41.688
Again, keep going!

01:17:53.017 --> 01:17:54.578
I can't do it!

01:17:56.474 --> 01:17:57.619
It's too hard.

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:59.383
I thought...

01:18:00.826 --> 01:18:01.938
I thought that...

01:18:03.258 --> 01:18:04.567
It's too hard.

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:06.097
I can't do it.

01:18:06.297 --> 01:18:07.988
What can't you do?

01:18:09.466 --> 01:18:11.189
What exactly?

01:18:19.098 --> 01:18:21.040
I can't cope. With prison.

01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:23.446
It's too hard. I can't do it.

01:18:25.114 --> 01:18:26.226
You can.

01:18:40.986 --> 01:18:42.415
You wanted to see me?

01:18:43.835 --> 01:18:44.783
Yes.

01:18:47.578 --> 01:18:49.465
I know it wasn't you.

01:18:50.618 --> 01:18:52.145
I never thought it was.

01:18:55.386 --> 01:18:56.531
I'm scared.

01:18:58.426 --> 01:18:59.539
The whole time.

01:19:00.218 --> 01:19:01.462
I'm scared.

01:19:04.058 --> 01:19:05.487
I needed to...

01:19:06.267 --> 01:19:07.827
see someone I love.

01:19:16.827 --> 01:19:18.321
I forgive you.

01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:21.489
I don't want any enemies, see?

01:19:30.234 --> 01:19:31.445
Thanks for coming.

01:19:39.099 --> 01:19:40.506
There's something else.

01:19:41.691 --> 01:19:43.601
I knew about your issues
with Christine.

01:19:44.187 --> 01:19:46.423
The file, the annex. Her ultimatum.

01:19:46.779 --> 01:19:49.048
I planned to use it
to get back at you.

01:19:51.611 --> 01:19:53.782
Pick it up.
It's in Daniel's office.

01:20:15.387 --> 01:20:17.809
Isabelle gave me this letter for you.

01:20:18.971 --> 01:20:20.826
She can't trust anyone else.

01:20:22.715 --> 01:20:23.664
Be careful.

01:20:26.779 --> 01:20:27.706
Daniel...

01:20:28.059 --> 01:20:29.586
Nobody will believe me.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:31.090
I need you.

01:20:32.347 --> 01:20:34.005
You know I trust you.

01:20:34.651 --> 01:20:37.334
I have a favor to ask.
Don't feel obligated.

01:20:38.107 --> 01:20:39.056
It's your call.

01:20:39.131 --> 01:20:40.626
Never seen her before.

01:20:40.859 --> 01:20:41.807
Thanks.

01:20:42.268 --> 01:20:43.729
Ask the ticket clerk.

01:20:45.179 --> 01:20:46.259
Okay.

01:20:48.859 --> 01:20:50.419
Do you know this woman?

01:20:52.699 --> 01:20:53.626
Yes.

01:20:53.788 --> 01:20:55.381
I remember her very well.

01:21:02.428 --> 01:21:04.632
One for Dernier Rivage , please.

01:21:07.836 --> 01:21:10.170
Sorry, I'm out of cash.
You'll take a card?

01:21:10.395 --> 01:21:11.737
Sure, no problem.

01:21:19.452 --> 01:21:20.728
Candy?

01:21:20.956 --> 01:21:21.904
Thanks.

01:21:24.987 --> 01:21:26.264
Move it, will you?

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:28.314
Sorry. Candy?

01:21:29.148 --> 01:21:30.260
Thanks.

01:21:34.716 --> 01:21:35.993
Here it is.

01:21:36.443 --> 01:21:37.752
Playing the cop, huh?

01:21:37.948 --> 01:21:40.501
I just never thought she was guilty.

01:21:40.956 --> 01:21:42.810
How did you know where to go?

01:21:43.036 --> 01:21:46.134
She'd mentioned the film.
The theater was easy to find.

01:21:48.059 --> 01:21:49.848
We'll see if it checks out.

01:21:50.652 --> 01:21:52.408
Maybe we didn't look everywhere.

01:21:53.276 --> 01:21:55.098
She was so obviously guilty.

01:21:55.739 --> 01:21:57.495
On top of that, she confessed.

01:21:58.908 --> 01:22:01.330
She took me through the whole movie.

01:22:02.107 --> 01:22:05.817
She watched it from start to finish,
at half past midnight.

01:22:06.716 --> 01:22:09.137
She couldn't have been
at Christine Riviere's.

01:22:10.076 --> 01:22:12.018
If she has an alibi,
keep digging.

01:22:12.956 --> 01:22:14.298
Is it a good movie?

01:22:14.492 --> 01:22:17.110
Apparently.
I haven't seen it yet.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:19.987
Thanks.

01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:55.447
Why ''Isa''?

01:22:56.157 --> 01:22:59.124
Maybe she really believed
I'd stabbed her.

01:22:59.676 --> 01:23:01.170
She hated me so much.

01:23:03.708 --> 01:23:04.690
Yes, I know.

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:07.195
You all noticed them.

01:23:07.388 --> 01:23:08.817
We never discussed them.

01:23:09.853 --> 01:23:12.406
You assumed
they proved she put up a fight.

01:23:12.893 --> 01:23:15.282
It only occurred to me later...

01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:19.676
She was perched shakily on a chair.

01:23:19.868 --> 01:23:21.013
Just about there.

01:23:21.981 --> 01:23:22.908
And then?

01:23:23.837 --> 01:23:25.298
Then nothing.

01:23:25.596 --> 01:23:27.255
Except,
before tending to her arm,

01:23:27.452 --> 01:23:29.940
she stowed the chair in the shed.

01:23:30.428 --> 01:23:32.697
She's an extremely tidy person.

01:23:32.893 --> 01:23:35.227
- Borderline obsessive.
- Yes, indeed.

01:23:35.517 --> 01:23:37.142
I'll take a look next door.

01:23:37.341 --> 01:23:38.290
Goodbye.

01:23:38.941 --> 01:23:39.889
All I know is,

01:23:40.317 --> 01:23:41.811
she's a good neighbor.

01:23:56.317 --> 01:23:57.778
You okay? Are you hurt?

01:23:58.653 --> 01:24:00.824
I'm fine.
I'll just disinfect it.

01:26:03.934 --> 01:26:07.098
It's obvious
my client was wrongly accused.

01:26:07.294 --> 01:26:09.628
A confirmed alibi,
no conclusive evidence,

01:26:09.822 --> 01:26:11.578
no DNA at the scene...

01:26:11.902 --> 01:26:13.463
There are still gray areas.

01:26:14.334 --> 01:26:15.993
The scarf, for example.

01:26:16.190 --> 01:26:19.736
You still claim
you lost an identical scarf?

01:26:19.934 --> 01:26:21.014
That's right.

01:26:21.438 --> 01:26:23.096
It was exactly the same.

01:26:23.774 --> 01:26:25.814
If we find it, it'll be intact.

01:26:26.238 --> 01:26:28.180
Might I make a request?

01:26:28.735 --> 01:26:29.628
Go ahead.

01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:33.176
Would you allow my client
to go with your officers

01:26:33.502 --> 01:26:35.924
to look for the scarf herself?

01:26:43.902 --> 01:26:45.658
Granted. I give you 3 hours.

01:26:45.855 --> 01:26:47.284
But that's the last request!

01:27:01.823 --> 01:27:03.416
The scarf means freedom.

01:27:04.158 --> 01:27:05.980
It can't have just vanished.

01:27:07.935 --> 01:27:09.179
How long left?

01:27:10.878 --> 01:27:11.925
A half-hour.

01:27:17.439 --> 01:27:18.387
What?

01:27:52.031 --> 01:27:52.958
Intact.

01:27:54.143 --> 01:27:55.452
No tears.

01:27:57.662 --> 01:27:58.972
I'll take this one.

01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:29.118
Isabelle Guerin
was released today.

01:28:29.311 --> 01:28:32.889
An example of the ideal suspect
falling victim

01:28:33.119 --> 01:28:35.291
to a series of wicked coincidences.

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:38.585
Beware of evidence
that doesn't stand up to inspection

01:28:38.784 --> 01:28:41.653
and motives
that are too good to be true.

01:28:41.855 --> 01:28:44.572
It was almost
another miscarriage ofjustice,

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:47.582
but this time the lead investigator

01:28:47.776 --> 01:28:49.499
displayed great humanity.

01:28:49.696 --> 01:28:51.386
He conducted the case
impeccably.

01:28:51.583 --> 01:28:53.852
The case shows once again

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:55.989
that confessions can be dangerous.

01:28:56.191 --> 01:28:58.558
They are never proof of guilt.

01:28:58.751 --> 01:29:01.020
Let's hope officers,
who all too often

01:29:01.216 --> 01:29:04.412
look for an easy conviction,
will learn the lesson.

01:29:05.023 --> 01:29:08.023
Sources suggest
the investigators' new leads include

01:29:08.224 --> 01:29:10.645
a prowler
or acquaintance of the victim.

01:29:49.824 --> 01:29:51.351
Morning, Miss Guerin.

01:30:22.912 --> 01:30:24.319
Miss Isabelle Guerin?

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:25.333
Speaking.

01:30:25.536 --> 01:30:27.903
This is Jean Druon,
your company banker.

01:30:28.096 --> 01:30:29.918
What can I do for you?

01:30:30.112 --> 01:30:31.356
It's a bit awkward.

01:30:31.552 --> 01:30:34.302
A serious matter.
I just received, by anonymous mail,

01:30:34.497 --> 01:30:38.141
details of dealings between
Christine Riviere and a law firm.

01:30:38.496 --> 01:30:39.423
And?

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:41.273
We're currently checking,

01:30:41.472 --> 01:30:43.927
but it looks like
a certain Philippe Deschamps

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:47.389
tried to conceal funds
siphoned off from one deal.

01:30:47.456 --> 01:30:48.471
How much?

01:30:48.641 --> 01:30:50.102
I'm not sure exactly.

01:30:50.305 --> 01:30:53.022
The accounts were tampered with.
Approximately

01:30:53.216 --> 01:30:54.623
80 million euros.

01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:56.149
I see.

01:30:56.353 --> 01:30:59.255
Complete your investigation
and keep me informed.

01:31:06.881 --> 01:31:08.670
Call a meeting for tomorrow morning.

01:31:08.864 --> 01:31:09.813
Everybody?

01:31:10.753 --> 01:31:11.735
All our executives.

01:31:12.481 --> 01:31:14.783
And those of our affiliates,

01:31:14.945 --> 01:31:17.759
including senior staff
at our legal advisors.

01:31:18.433 --> 01:31:20.221
That includes Philippe Deschamps?

01:31:21.057 --> 01:31:22.005
Yes.

01:31:32.993 --> 01:31:34.335
I know what I owe you.

01:31:35.584 --> 01:31:36.478
Thanks.

01:31:37.537 --> 01:31:39.577
You'd have done the same for me.

01:31:39.745 --> 01:31:40.857
I'm sure of that.

01:32:17.281 --> 01:32:19.070
Beautiful, aren't we?

01:32:26.113 --> 01:32:27.607
I'm really happy for you.

01:32:33.538 --> 01:32:34.912
And thanks for that file.

01:32:35.105 --> 01:32:36.349
What file?

01:32:38.945 --> 01:32:40.155
Morning, everybody.

01:32:42.274 --> 01:32:44.216
Thanks for coming in.

01:32:45.665 --> 01:32:47.672
The aim of this meeting...

01:32:48.865 --> 01:32:50.392
Yes? What do you want?

01:32:50.594 --> 01:32:52.186
Excuse me,
can I have a word?

01:32:52.385 --> 01:32:53.334
Go ahead.

01:32:53.665 --> 01:32:54.559
Right here?

01:32:54.754 --> 01:32:56.248
Yes. Hurry up.

01:32:57.282 --> 01:32:59.933
The police are here.
Crime and Fraud squads.

01:33:00.321 --> 01:33:01.434
Do you know why?

01:33:01.633 --> 01:33:03.575
They're here to arrest someone.

01:33:04.225 --> 01:33:05.687
Someone in this room?

01:33:05.762 --> 01:33:06.744
Yes.

01:33:07.201 --> 01:33:08.314
Show them in.

01:33:12.545 --> 01:33:13.527
Gentlemen...

01:33:16.962 --> 01:33:18.172
Philippe Deschamps?

01:33:18.402 --> 01:33:20.312
- Yes.
- Come with us, please.

01:33:35.202 --> 01:33:36.958
I'll fly to Washington this week

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:38.779
to set out my new strategy.

01:33:39.042 --> 01:33:41.431
I'd like to outline it for you,

01:33:41.634 --> 01:33:43.544
so we all know
where we're going.

01:33:43.938 --> 01:33:47.353
You will be charged
with the murder of Christine Riviere.

01:33:47.554 --> 01:33:48.503
What?

01:33:48.802 --> 01:33:50.657
We'll do pre-emptive searches

01:33:50.882 --> 01:33:53.217
on your vehicle,
then at your home.

01:33:56.354 --> 01:33:57.336
This is insane!

01:33:57.538 --> 01:33:59.425
Don't worry,
all will be explained.

01:34:09.058 --> 01:34:10.073
Torn.

01:34:16.355 --> 01:34:18.143
Did I leave my scarf at yours?

01:34:20.386 --> 01:34:21.696
I must have lost it.

01:34:28.354 --> 01:34:29.696
I thought as much...

01:34:29.922 --> 01:34:32.508
You tried to throw suspicion
onto Isabelle Guerin.

01:34:32.706 --> 01:34:34.714
Even writing ''Isa'' in blood!

01:34:34.914 --> 01:34:37.532
One look earlier and I knew.
It was Isabelle!

01:34:37.762 --> 01:34:38.711
Don't start that again.

01:34:38.883 --> 01:34:40.573
This scrap of fabric is bullshit!

01:34:40.899 --> 01:34:43.898
Why'd I leave it at the scene,
if hers was intact?

01:34:44.162 --> 01:34:46.944
You were the only person
who knew she'd lost it.

01:34:47.554 --> 01:34:48.798
You took advantage.

01:34:49.027 --> 01:34:50.815
Trouble is,
she never loses anything.

01:34:51.042 --> 01:34:51.904
Take him in.

01:34:52.194 --> 01:34:54.136
Let go of me!

01:34:56.675 --> 01:34:58.301
All the party guests agree,

01:34:58.499 --> 01:35:00.888
Deschamps stayed behind
with the victim.

01:35:02.306 --> 01:35:06.813
In the file sent to your bank,
we found an ultimatum from her.

01:35:07.235 --> 01:35:10.235
He was bound to be exposed
as a crook.

01:35:11.267 --> 01:35:15.042
Your assistant confirmed
Deschamps collected the file in 
person.

01:35:15.363 --> 01:35:17.370
When we checked your archives,

01:35:17.635 --> 01:35:20.504
the annex had of course disappeared.

01:35:21.379 --> 01:35:22.808
He denies everything.

01:35:23.618 --> 01:35:25.277
The exact opposite of you.

01:35:26.627 --> 01:35:28.514
Human beings are so complicated.

01:35:29.059 --> 01:35:30.074
Sir, will you allow

01:35:30.275 --> 01:35:32.730
my client to leave Paris
for a few days

01:35:32.962 --> 01:35:34.905
for an important meeting
in Washington?

01:35:35.683 --> 01:35:36.796
Granted.

01:35:37.506 --> 01:35:38.586
I owe you that much.

01:35:39.299 --> 01:35:41.470
You owe me nothing at all, sir.

01:35:42.115 --> 01:35:43.838
You were doing your job.

01:35:45.347 --> 01:35:47.736
I'm grateful that you listened to me.

01:35:47.939 --> 01:35:48.866
Despite everything.

01:35:49.059 --> 01:35:50.466
Despite myself, even.

01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:49.499
Thirsty?

01:37:26.308 --> 01:37:27.552
Strong stuff.

01:37:28.964 --> 01:37:30.241
Serious poison.

01:37:31.747 --> 01:37:33.536
But you know they're safe.

01:37:34.468 --> 01:37:35.679
And so are you.

01:37:36.196 --> 01:37:37.341
For now.

01:37:39.716 --> 01:37:41.440
I always admired you.

01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:44.963
That strung-out wreck of a woman
wasn't you.

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.996
I had my doubts.
I got the pill analyzed.

01:37:48.708 --> 01:37:49.853
A placebo.

01:37:50.341 --> 01:37:51.682
Sugar pills.

01:37:52.356 --> 01:37:53.534
A great pretence.

01:37:53.796 --> 01:37:54.876
Like all the rest.

01:37:55.268 --> 01:37:57.602
Confess and prove your innocence.
Smart.

01:37:58.180 --> 01:37:59.128
That was you.

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:00.668
The real you.

01:38:03.269 --> 01:38:04.795
You'll never be like her.

01:38:05.156 --> 01:38:07.098
She was capable of killing.

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.544
But not for love.

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:18.009
Flight at 8. Wake you?

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.199
Goodnight. Sleep well.
