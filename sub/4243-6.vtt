00:00.177 --> 00:01.652
So here's what you missed on <i>Glee</i>...

00:01.670 --> 00:03.252
<i>The cast list for</i> Greese
<i>went up and Kitty's none</i>

00:03.270 --> 00:04.657
<i>too happy.</i>
- Ughhh!

00:04.675 --> 00:06.309
Who the hell is Patty Simcox?

00:06.327 --> 00:07.997
<i>And neither is Jake</i>
<i>because Ryder got Danny</i>

00:07.997 --> 00:09.965
<i>and Marley got Sandy.</i>
<i>Unique's paying Rizzo,</i>

00:09.999 --> 00:11.901
<i>which totally confused</i>
<i>Principal Figgins.</i>

00:11.935 --> 00:14.286
Unique Adams is nothing more
than an attractive, buxom young

00:14.321 --> 00:17.156
<i>woman who has got it going on</i>
<i>in all the right places.</i>

00:17.190 --> 00:18.708
She's a brick house, Sue.

00:18.742 --> 00:20.393
<i>And Blaine's the Teen Angel,</i>

00:20.444 --> 00:22.061
<i>and he's totally broken up</i>
<i>about breaking up with Kurt.</i>

00:22.112 --> 00:24.012
<i>Sue's out for Finn, because</i>
<i>called her baby retarded.</i>

00:24.031 --> 00:25.981
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say that.

00:26.015 --> 00:27.850
<i>And now he's gonna take over</i>
<i>Glee Club</i>

00:27.884 --> 00:29.685
<i>because Will's going</i>
<i>to Washington on sabbatical.</i>

00:29.703 --> 00:30.953
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:34.508 --> 00:35.991
(school bell ringing)

00:36.025 --> 00:37.860
All right, guys, listen up.

00:37.878 --> 00:39.161
I have an announcement to make.

00:39.195 --> 00:40.913
Adele is dd.
No.

00:40.964 --> 00:42.164
I have been asked to join

00:42.198 --> 00:43.582
a blue ribbon panel

00:43.633 --> 00:45.434
to rewrite the arts
curriculum nationwide.

00:45.469 --> 00:47.369
Wow! Congratulations.
WILL: Thank you.

00:47.387 --> 00:49.037
I'll be taking
a short sabbatical,

00:49.056 --> 00:52.241
which means I'm leaving McKinley
at the end of the week.

00:53.894 --> 00:55.845
What? This is crazy.

00:55.879 --> 00:57.346
But Glee Club is your life.

00:57.380 --> 00:59.214
Which is why
this is only temporary.

00:59.232 --> 01:01.016
I'll be back
right after sectionals.

01:01.050 --> 01:02.735
Wait... <i>after</i> sectionals?! Whoa!

01:02.769 --> 01:05.554
I mean, it's not like we know.

01:05.572 --> 01:07.055
Guys, guys, calm down.

01:07.074 --> 01:08.574
Look, I knew I needed
to find a replacement,

01:08.608 --> 01:11.226
which is why I brought in
Finn Hudson.

01:11.244 --> 01:14.430
Mr. Shue, Finn cannot
take over Glee Club.

01:14.464 --> 01:15.614
He doesn't know what
he's doing at all.

01:15.665 --> 01:16.782
Sorry, Finn.

01:16.833 --> 01:18.534
Guys, I know I can do this.

01:18.568 --> 01:19.952
And I've got some really
great ideas for sectionals.

01:20.003 --> 01:21.370
We'll all be dead by then!
ARTIE: Tina.

01:21.404 --> 01:22.872
Finn doesn't know how to direct

01:22.906 --> 01:24.072
a musical!
No, that's fine.

01:24.091 --> 01:25.791
No, we can't win without him.

01:25.842 --> 01:26.876
Who's going to drive the bus?

01:26.910 --> 01:29.411
Finn Hudson, Schuester.

01:29.429 --> 01:31.630
Figgins' office, right now.

01:34.801 --> 01:36.752
I-I don't even understand
how you found out.

01:36.770 --> 01:38.721
Oh, William, I have
the choir room bugged.

01:38.755 --> 01:39.922
That plaque with the
dead fat lady on it...

01:39.940 --> 01:41.590
her eyes are cameras. Okay, Sue,

01:41.608 --> 01:44.310
this is none of your business,
and besides, I've already

01:44.361 --> 01:46.595
cleared this with Figgins, so,
I don't see what the problem is.

01:46.613 --> 01:48.898
Will, of course, you don't,
because this is just

01:48.932 --> 01:50.983
another one of your
ill-conceived,

01:51.034 --> 01:52.601
bizarrely sentimental schemes

01:52.619 --> 01:54.804
that displays
absolutely no forethought

01:54.838 --> 01:55.955
and appears
immediately ridiculous

01:55.989 --> 01:59.291
to everyone in America
except you.

01:59.293 --> 02:00.910
Finn Hudson barely
graduated high school

02:00.944 --> 02:02.828
less than six months ago,

02:02.879 --> 02:04.964
he has no bachelor's degree,
nor the certification

02:04.998 --> 02:06.332
to teach in the state of Ohio.

02:06.383 --> 02:09.134
Sue, Glee Club is not a class.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.285
It an extracurricular activity.

02:10.303 --> 02:12.287
Which is why it is perfectly legal

02:12.305 --> 02:14.673
for Finn to volunteer
his talents temporarily.

02:14.724 --> 02:16.124
I promise, this is
the right thing to do.

02:16.143 --> 02:18.144
I can take this glee
club to sectionals,

02:18.146 --> 02:19.595
and I know we can win.
I'll work just as hard

02:19.629 --> 02:22.631
as Mr. Shue does,
and do it all for free.

02:22.649 --> 02:25.484
Okay, let me just remind
everyone of something.

02:25.519 --> 02:27.135
For the past year, I have
shown the glee club mercy,

02:27.154 --> 02:28.303
and this school has enjoyed

02:28.321 --> 02:29.638
an unprecedented era of peace,

02:29.656 --> 02:31.490
but ifloaty the Gravy Clown

02:31.525 --> 02:33.692
is allowed to take over Glee Club,

02:33.743 --> 02:35.661
my denté with the art in this school

02:35.695 --> 02:36.829
will be over.

02:40.316 --> 02:41.951
(Sue screams)

02:41.985 --> 02:43.485
Hey!

02:43.503 --> 02:46.872
("O Fortuna" plays)

02:46.923 --> 02:49.041
You're a menace
to the State of Ohio!

02:54.923 --> 02:57.972
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font></font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

02:58.339 --> 02:58.816
Alright people,

02:58.835 --> 03:00.335
since your egregious ineptitude

03:00.353 --> 03:03.138
is making me lose
my will to live, I decided

03:03.172 --> 03:05.057
to bring in some of
my best upperclassmen

03:05.108 --> 03:06.392
to help you up your game.

03:06.443 --> 03:07.693
Let's partner up.

03:07.727 --> 03:09.695
We're going to go
across the floor.

03:09.729 --> 03:10.896
Let's start with some jetés.

03:10.947 --> 03:12.481
Hey.
Hey, how are you?

03:12.515 --> 03:14.149
Haven't seen you much the last.

03:14.183 --> 03:15.684
How have you been? I'm good.
You know, up and down.

03:17.120 --> 03:18.320
Now that Finn and

03:18.354 --> 03:19.822
are officially-officially
broken up,

03:19.856 --> 03:21.156
I feel like I can just

03:21.190 --> 03:23.242
focus on really why
I came to New York,

03:23.293 --> 03:25.694
which is my work.
Good.

03:25.712 --> 03:27.195
Use the floor, ladies.
Speaking of work,

03:27.214 --> 03:29.531
guess who go to the first
Off-Broadway play audition?

03:29.566 --> 03:30.833
What?

03:30.867 --> 03:32.200
I know.
I'm really excited.

03:32.219 --> 03:33.085
Watch your shoulder.

03:33.136 --> 03:34.220
So, do you know the director

03:34.254 --> 03:35.504
Ivan van Hoven?
Yeah.

03:35.538 --> 03:37.172
He's doing this, like, amazing

03:37.206 --> 03:38.874
avant-garde production
of The Glass Menagerie.

03:38.892 --> 03:40.593
It's going to be,
like, set in a zoo,

03:42.395 --> 03:45.380
and so, he's looking
for just a fresh face

03:45.398 --> 03:46.932
to play his Laura Wingfield.

03:46.983 --> 03:48.684
Wow, great role.

03:48.718 --> 03:51.437
But you're too hot play Laura.

03:58.245 --> 04:02.197
So, I'm going to be spending
the week just getting off book.

04:02.231 --> 04:03.782
Hey, some advice.

04:03.784 --> 04:05.701
You're not ready for Ivan.

04:05.735 --> 04:08.403
You're not tough enough yet.
You don't have enough wounds.

04:08.421 --> 04:10.789
Look, I auditioned
for him for ***,

04:10.840 --> 04:13.592
and he made me recite
my monologue in a slip,

04:13.627 --> 04:15.077
standing on one foot,

04:15.095 --> 04:16.428
pouring tomato juice
all over myself.

04:16.463 --> 04:17.913
Skip it, Schwimmer.

04:17.930 --> 04:19.932
Ivan will eat you alive.

04:19.966 --> 04:22.718
I can take it.

04:22.752 --> 04:25.054
And look, I was thinking,
maybe you should

04:25.088 --> 04:26.939
audition, too.
For Amanda Wingfield.

04:26.973 --> 04:30.943
You mean the faded Southern
belle who spends her haggy,

04:33.530 --> 04:34.647
I thought that you maybe
might want

04:34.698 --> 04:35.931
to get back in the game.

04:37.317 --> 04:39.618
Juniors, take five.

04:39.653 --> 04:42.905
Freshmen... I don't know...
just, honey, do something.

04:42.939 --> 04:45.291
Brody, sidebar.

04:45.293 --> 04:46.992
I'm looking for a new TA

04:47.043 --> 04:48.577
I think you'd be perfect,

04:48.611 --> 04:50.796
but it's going to mean
a lot of late nights,

04:50.830 --> 04:52.114
lot of time at the school,

04:52.132 --> 04:53.582
you're going to have
to help me prep lessons...

04:53.616 --> 04:55.634
Yeah, it-it doesn't matter.
I'm... I'm I.

04:55.669 --> 04:58.420
Good decision.
We'll start this weekend.

04:58.454 --> 05:00.673
Uh, actually could we...
could we start on Monday?

05:00.724 --> 05:02.791
I-I promised Rachel that
I would help her out.

05:02.809 --> 05:04.927
Yeah. I understand.

05:04.961 --> 05:07.346
Start next week.

05:07.397 --> 05:09.631
TINA:
Okay, hold on and suck in.

05:09.649 --> 05:12.017
(grunts) I am.

05:12.068 --> 05:16.188
I don't understand.
This fit yesterday.

05:16.239 --> 05:17.823
Maybe it's stress bloating.

05:17.857 --> 05:19.825
I get it all the time.
Hey.

05:19.859 --> 05:20.993
BOTH:
Tina.

05:21.027 --> 05:21.944
(laughs)

05:21.978 --> 05:23.445
I love it so much.

05:23.479 --> 05:25.030
I promise I won't pee in it.

05:25.081 --> 05:27.315
I'm here for my fitting.
Where is Harajuku Girl?

05:27.334 --> 05:29.985
I thought you quit because
your part was too small.

05:30.003 --> 05:33.339
Well, Spraed Hawk Nose,
to quote Shakespeare,

05:33.373 --> 05:35.674
"There's no small parts,
only fat actresses."

05:35.709 --> 05:38.544
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I just say "fat?"

05:38.595 --> 05:40.328
I was distracted by Marley's

05:40.347 --> 05:42.548
unfortunate and very noticeable
weight gain.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.522
<i>I swear, I'm not</i>
<i>eating any differently.</i>

05:50.557 --> 05:52.891
How is this happening?

05:57.230 --> 05:58.864
I usually don't believe

05:58.898 --> 06:00.816
in the lamestream media's
definition of "science,"

06:00.850 --> 06:02.818
but it just makes sense

06:02.852 --> 06:05.654
that your metabolism
is grinding to a halt.

06:05.688 --> 06:08.040
You're getting the body
you were destined to have.

06:08.074 --> 06:10.242
I had to accept how I am.

06:10.293 --> 06:12.194
I spend almost
every weekend alone

06:12.212 --> 06:14.696
because everyone just assumes
that the popular girl's busy.

06:14.714 --> 06:16.698
I'm doing this play because
I could use some friends.

06:16.716 --> 06:19.435
Real ones.

06:19.469 --> 06:21.253
So, in the spirit of <i>Grease,</i>
I thought it would be good way

06:21.304 --> 06:24.339
for us to get to know each
other, if we had a sleepover.

06:24.373 --> 06:26.058
Sleepover?

06:26.092 --> 06:28.427
Tomorrow night, my place.
Just us girls.

06:28.478 --> 06:29.845
Can I come?

06:29.879 --> 06:32.047
I'm not going
if Unique's not invited.

06:32.082 --> 06:33.766
Please?
Ladyboy can come.

06:33.817 --> 06:36.769
Yes. But if I catch you hiding
your dinky between your legs

06:36.820 --> 06:39.438
and prancing around like <i>Silence</i>
<i>of the Lambs,</i> you're out.

06:41.074 --> 06:42.741
(school bell rings)

06:42.776 --> 06:44.726
Rough day at Rydell High?

06:44.761 --> 06:48.914
Mom, when did yo?

06:50.083 --> 06:52.067
Big?

06:53.503 --> 06:57.706
Well, I battled my weight
all through high school.

06:57.740 --> 07:01.243
And when your daddy
and I had you,

07:01.261 --> 07:03.245
and I thought
that it would fix everything

07:03.263 --> 07:05.931
that was wrong between us,
and it didn't,

07:05.965 --> 07:08.884
that's when I started eating
and didn't stop.

07:08.918 --> 07:10.269
Why are you asking me this?

07:10.271 --> 07:12.271
I didn't fit into my
Sandy costume again.

07:14.474 --> 07:17.476
Every time I try it on,
it just gets tighter.

07:19.696 --> 07:23.232
So, I thought maybe...

07:23.266 --> 07:25.617
it's starting to happen to me.

07:25.652 --> 07:28.603
You know, my...

07:28.621 --> 07:30.823
my genetics.

07:30.874 --> 07:34.827
I didn't raise
a victim or a quitter.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.612
I raised a star.

07:37.630 --> 07:41.583
You have control
over your life and your body.

07:41.618 --> 07:44.620
And you are thin and beautiful.

07:44.622 --> 07:48.640
But you won't stay that way

07:48.675 --> 07:50.676
unless you fight for.

07:52.628 --> 07:55.964
So, starting now,

07:55.982 --> 07:58.934
we are <i>on a strict new diet.</i>

07:58.968 --> 08:01.069
Together.

08:04.240 --> 08:08.160
(School bell rings)

08:08.194 --> 08:11.029
Uh-uh. No way. Nope.

08:11.031 --> 08:12.164
You are not allowed in here.

08:14.751 --> 08:17.251
Not for 19-year-old who just
got kicked out in the Army

08:17.820 --> 08:19.171
and spent several months
backpacking

08:19.205 --> 08:20.622
through Georgia, of all places.

08:20.656 --> 08:22.657
I mean, it seriously
boggles the mind.

08:22.675 --> 08:23.825
You must have done everything

08:23.843 --> 08:25.294
a person could possibly do
in that state,

08:25.328 --> 08:26.962
including hillbilly
hand-fishing,

08:26.996 --> 08:28.847
and plus-sized
male prostitution.

08:28.882 --> 08:32.183
Look, I came here
to apologize, okay?

08:32.217 --> 08:34.836
I'm sorry for calling
your baby a... a retard.

08:34.871 --> 08:36.855
I... I'm sorry.

08:36.857 --> 08:39.357
That word was offensive, and
it just came out wrong, anyway.

08:41.443 --> 08:43.227
I think it's exactly
what you meant to say.

08:43.279 --> 08:46.031
I've seen your true
colors, Finn Hudson.

08:46.033 --> 08:48.033
You've got hate in that
heart, Double Stuff.

08:53.706 --> 08:57.075
Fine. I tried to apologize.

09:00.179 --> 09:01.747
Excuse me... I got
to get to rehearsal.

09:01.798 --> 09:03.749
Yeah? Where do you think you're rehearsing?
The auditorium.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.918
No, no, not this week,
or next week.

09:05.969 --> 09:08.170
You see, since you've taken
the liberty of redefining

09:08.204 --> 09:10.255
what it means
to be a teacher at McKinley,

09:10.306 --> 09:12.057
well, I took the liberty

09:12.091 --> 09:14.092
of reserving the auditorium
for Cheerios! Practice,

09:14.143 --> 09:16.395
You're going to have to find some
other place to rehearse

09:16.429 --> 09:17.679
your idiotic musical.

09:17.713 --> 09:19.348
I don't know.
Maybe the Moose Lodge?

09:19.382 --> 09:21.383
Or Hell itself.

09:29.158 --> 09:31.577
(whirring and clanging)

09:31.611 --> 09:34.029
You sure you wrote
down the right address?

09:34.063 --> 09:35.914
Yeah, oh, Finn works here.

09:35.949 --> 09:38.367
And we're supposed
to rehearse here?

09:38.401 --> 09:41.286
(sighs) Guys, it's perfect.

09:41.337 --> 09:44.590
Kill two birds with one stone.

09:44.624 --> 09:45.941
I got to overhaul this jalopy,

09:45.975 --> 09:47.209
and you guys need
to figure out how

09:47.243 --> 09:48.927
to be convincing
grease monkeys.

09:51.598 --> 09:54.266
I've never even changed the oil
in my car... I can't fix this.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.551
I cannot believe
you got this part over me.

09:56.585 --> 09:59.104
Right, right.
Look, acting is about

09:59.138 --> 10:00.606
knowing the material, ri.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.140
The themes.

10:02.191 --> 10:05.110
So, what is <i>Grease</i> all about?

10:06.429 --> 10:07.929
Well, it's about fixing cars

10:07.947 --> 10:09.948
and getting, getting grease

10:09.983 --> 10:12.267
under your fingernails,
and about

10:12.285 --> 10:17.906
signing a blood oath with
your brothers to the very end.

10:17.940 --> 10:20.108
Okay, but where should we...?

10:20.126 --> 10:21.493
I mean, there's no stage
or anything.

10:21.544 --> 10:23.078
Look out there.

10:23.112 --> 10:25.464
Imagine an audience

10:25.498 --> 10:26.632
anxiously awaiting
your arrival.

10:26.666 --> 10:28.450
And look up there.

10:28.468 --> 10:30.919
Spotlights.

10:30.953 --> 10:32.838
And-and look
right here...

10:33.890 --> 10:36.174
And what do you see?

10:38.011 --> 10:39.811
An old clunker.

10:39.846 --> 10:43.015
Yeah, it an old clunker.

10:44.183 --> 10:46.351
Tell me what Danny Zuko sees.

10:53.159 --> 10:54.493
It's systematic.

10:55.745 --> 10:56.445
It's...

10:56.479 --> 11:00.115
hydromatic.

11:00.149 --> 11:02.817

Now, uh, let's try
it again with, like,

13:05.107 --> 13:06.324
double the energy.

13:09.327 --> 13:11.361
(grunts) I can't believe

13:11.412 --> 13:13.613
you have a dance audition
for <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

13:13.647 --> 13:14.948
Well, Ivan is
a very physical director.

13:14.982 --> 13:15.949
All of his work is very

13:15.983 --> 13:16.950
movement-driven.
Ooh.

13:16.984 --> 13:18.985
Come on. Now?
Ooh, release.

13:19.003 --> 13:21.371
(phone vibrates) Ooh. Ow. Ugh.

13:21.422 --> 13:24.657
Oh. <i>Grease</i> update from Tina.
Ooh.

13:24.675 --> 13:26.993
Ooh. Apparently the girl
playing Sandy

13:27.011 --> 13:29.963
has gained so much weight,
she can't fit into her clothes.

13:29.997 --> 13:32.182
No. That's unfortunate.

13:32.216 --> 13:34.718
But it doesn't really have
anything to do with us.

13:35.937 --> 13:37.837
No. We're not.

13:37.855 --> 13:39.689
We are not going to see it.

13:39.724 --> 13:41.475
Not gonna see what?

13:41.509 --> 13:43.343
What are you doing
in my studio, Schwimmer?

13:43.361 --> 13:45.028
Practicing for yo big audition?

13:45.063 --> 13:46.563
Yeah, this is actually
my roommate Kurt.

13:46.614 --> 13:48.482
He's helping me with it.
It's an honor

13:48.516 --> 13:49.516
to meet you, Ms. July, and...

13:49.534 --> 13:51.351
Ooh, y-you've
got some abs!

13:52.353 --> 13:53.737
That's sweet.

13:53.788 --> 13:55.072
Can you get the bar?

13:55.123 --> 13:57.824
So, you were saying.

13:57.858 --> 13:59.025
Not gonna see what?

13:59.043 --> 14:00.994
Her recently

14:01.028 --> 14:02.162
broken-up-with
ex-boyfriend is directing

14:02.196 --> 14:03.163
my recently broken-up-with
ex-boyfriend

14:03.197 --> 14:05.482
in a school production
of <i>Grease,</i>

14:05.516 --> 14:06.883
and we've a bunch
of friends in it,

14:06.918 --> 14:09.035
so we were debating
whether or not we should go.

14:09.053 --> 14:10.337
When I it?

14:10.371 --> 14:11.321
This weekend.

14:11.355 --> 14:13.423
Oh. You need to go.

14:15.543 --> 14:17.377
It's a perfect opportunity
for closure.

14:17.395 --> 14:18.929
I have closure.

14:18.980 --> 14:22.432
Okay.
Then go have fun, Schwim.

14:22.483 --> 14:24.884
Or go because it's <i>Grease.</i>

14:24.902 --> 14:27.437
Go because it's your friends,
it's your high school.

14:27.488 --> 14:29.906
Rachel, I'm going.
I need to see him.

14:29.941 --> 14:31.024
I haven't seen him since.

14:31.058 --> 14:32.442
I'm not sleeping.

14:32.493 --> 14:34.027
I'm living off of bien
and <i>The Notebook.</i>

14:34.061 --> 14:35.862
Please come with me.
I can't do it alone.

14:35.896 --> 14:37.397
Look, even if I wanted to go,
which I don't,

14:37.415 --> 14:38.915
we don't have the money.

14:38.950 --> 14:41.067
Kurt's an intern and I spent
all of my money

14:41.085 --> 14:42.202
on my last trip home, so...

14:42.236 --> 14:43.537
CASSANDRA:
Well...

14:43.571 --> 14:47.374
I could give you my JetBlue
frequent flyer miles.

14:47.408 --> 14:48.375
I can't use them,

14:48.409 --> 14:50.210
ever since I was
banned from my...

14:50.244 --> 14:52.712
Bloody Mary-fueled
panic attack

14:52.746 --> 14:53.964
at 30,000 feet,

14:53.998 --> 14:56.249
which resulted in
the hospitalization

14:56.267 --> 14:57.767
of three flight attendants.

14:59.587 --> 15:01.388
And don't go
if you don't want to.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.422
But I just think you'll

15:02.440 --> 15:03.690
regret missing it.

15:06.194 --> 15:07.894
Here's my
first-place trophy

15:07.928 --> 15:10.564
for "Most Tongues Spoken"
at Bible camp.

15:10.598 --> 15:12.765
And this is Mr. Jo Jo.

15:12.783 --> 15:15.569
I rode him for six years
until he broke my hymen.

15:15.603 --> 15:17.070
(knocking on door)

15:17.104 --> 15:18.905
Triple-layer
fudge cake, yo!

15:18.939 --> 15:20.574
TINA:
Kettle Corn and pizza!

15:20.608 --> 15:22.275
UNIQUE:
And chocolate donuts!

15:22.293 --> 15:25.745
Unique loves her delicious,
chocolatey Krispy Kreme...

15:25.779 --> 15:27.664
Dig in, everybody, and then
we'll have pillow fights

15:27.715 --> 15:30.450
and ghost stories
and prayer circles

15:30.468 --> 15:31.668
and back rubs.

15:31.719 --> 15:33.253
Want a donut, Marley?

15:33.287 --> 15:34.921
Are there any healthy snacks?

15:34.955 --> 15:36.623
You can eat Kleenex.
They taste like clouds.

15:36.641 --> 15:38.975
Honey, we need to
have a little talk.

15:39.010 --> 15:40.594
Hey, that's mine.

15:40.628 --> 15:43.096
(girls chattering)

15:43.130 --> 15:44.797
Okay.

15:45.799 --> 15:47.634
These are called fingers.

15:47.652 --> 15:49.436
Just stick them
in your pie hole

15:49.470 --> 15:52.088
and bingo, you're magically
supermodel-thin forever.

15:52.123 --> 15:55.342
I don't want to make myself
vomit... that's gross.

15:55.376 --> 15:56.526
You know what's more gross?

15:56.561 --> 15:57.944
Having your gelatinous,
corpulent,

15:57.978 --> 15:59.613
six-ton stomach explode

15:59.647 --> 16:02.315
blood and pudding and sour
cream and chili cheese fries

16:02.333 --> 16:03.950
just because you didn't
love yourself enough

16:03.984 --> 16:05.318
to binge and purge.

16:06.320 --> 16:08.321
Do you do it?

16:08.339 --> 16:10.823
I would if I was born
with the fat gene.

16:10.841 --> 16:13.627
And let's be real, you weren't
just born with the fat gene,

16:13.661 --> 16:16.996
you were born with the circus
fat gene... no offense.

16:17.014 --> 16:19.266
Just think about it.

16:21.335 --> 16:26.339
(girls chattering)

16:32.530 --> 16:33.897
Hey.

16:33.948 --> 16:35.031
Where's Marley?

16:35.066 --> 16:36.516
Why, I'm right here,

16:36.534 --> 16:38.685
wearing my signature

16:38.703 --> 16:40.019

16:40.037 --> 16:41.321
I'm gonna bat my
bargain-basement eyes

16:41.355 --> 16:43.189
and steal your boyfriends,

16:43.207 --> 16:46.626

You wanted to see me?

18:26.460 --> 18:28.978
Finn Hudson,

18:29.013 --> 18:30.747
this is Rob and Betty Adams.

18:30.781 --> 18:32.182
I took the liberty
of calling them

18:32.233 --> 18:33.433
to congratulate them

18:33.467 --> 18:35.151
on their son landing

18:35.186 --> 18:37.170
the big role of Rizzo in <i>Grease,</i>

18:37.204 --> 18:38.988
and lo and behold,

18:39.023 --> 18:40.657
it was the first
they'd heard of it.

18:40.691 --> 18:43.159
Look, ever since Wade
was a little boy,

18:43.194 --> 18:44.294
we knew that he was different.

18:44.328 --> 18:45.779
Most little boys don't want

18:45.813 --> 18:47.664
to dress as Shirley Hemphill
for Halloween.

18:47.698 --> 18:49.449
I mean, it's just so specific.

18:49.483 --> 18:51.334
MRS. ADAMS:
When Wade performed as a girl

18:51.369 --> 18:53.286
at Nationals,
we were really proud.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.721
MR. ADAMS:
But Chicago is a very

18:54.755 --> 18:57.207
liberal city... I mean,
we live in Ohio, and...

18:58.175 --> 19:00.343
...to be perfectly honest,

19:00.378 --> 19:02.011
we're worried about
Wade's safety.

19:02.046 --> 19:03.329
I think you're overreacting.

19:03.347 --> 19:06.049
Are we?
Well, I've personally seen you

19:06.100 --> 19:07.967
physically assaulted
in the hallway.

19:08.001 --> 19:09.502
This concerns me.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.721
Wait, is that true?

19:14.058 --> 19:17.110
Ooh, put some pants
on, Mo'Nique!

19:19.847 --> 19:20.847
We're pulling Wade
out of the play,

19:20.865 --> 19:23.133
and we're asking Wade

19:23.167 --> 19:24.851
not to dress like a girl
during school hours.

19:24.869 --> 19:26.653
MRS. ADAMS:
Once he gets home, he can be

19:26.687 --> 19:28.405
whoever he wants to be.

19:28.456 --> 19:32.859
Wade Adams, you can return to your
sewing exam in Home Ec.

19:37.214 --> 19:39.532
I can't believe you would do
something like this.

19:39.567 --> 19:42.201
You mean do something like
conveniently protect the welfare

19:42.219 --> 19:44.721
of a student, so that it just
happens to derail

19:44.755 --> 19:46.756
the school musical?
I think that sounds exactly

19:46.807 --> 19:49.759
like something I'd do...
classic Sue Sylvester.

19:49.794 --> 19:51.561
If you don't have a Rizzo,
you don't have a show.

19:51.595 --> 19:53.897
Well, who says I can't find
another Rizzo?

19:53.931 --> 19:56.266
Hmm?
Me.

19:58.102 --> 20:00.219
Of course I can play Rizzo.

20:00.237 --> 20:01.738
(sighs) Are you sure?

20:01.772 --> 20:03.523
We open tomorrow and we
just gave you the script.

20:03.557 --> 20:05.408
I was born to play this role.
I've known it by heart

20:05.443 --> 20:06.860
since I was one, Artie, come on.

20:06.894 --> 20:08.528
So, what are you doing
in town, Santana?

20:08.562 --> 20:09.946
Shut up. Who cares?

20:09.997 --> 20:11.247
Yeah, the important thing
is that

20:11.282 --> 20:12.916
she's here, so the show
can go on.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.868
This one fits. I just looked
at the lines for Rizzo,

20:14.902 --> 20:16.402
and I think I can
be off-book by Friday.

20:16.420 --> 20:18.404
I may have to hold a script
in the second act.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.758
Sorry, Tina...
I called Santana.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.960
She was the obvious choice
to me.

20:24.011 --> 20:27.547
And if you played Rizzo,
then we wouldn't have a Jan.

20:27.581 --> 20:30.590
You have got to be kidding me.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:40.228 --> 20:42.479
All right, well, just remember,
no matter how many times

20:42.514 --> 20:44.732
people ask, we have to stick
to our five autograph limit.

20:44.766 --> 20:47.067
Right. I'm more concerned about
running into you-know-who.

20:47.102 --> 20:48.686
You'll be fine.

20:48.737 --> 20:53.307
Oh, look, it's your locker
next to my locker.

20:53.325 --> 20:54.825
Remember that time you got out
of that date

20:54.859 --> 20:55.993
th Mercedes by saying that you

20:56.027 --> 20:57.411
had a thing for me?
Oh.

20:57.445 --> 20:59.029
Yeah, it still burns
my ass to this day.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.165
Yes!
Honey.

21:01.199 --> 21:02.816
Oh, my God, guys.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.835
It's amazing you guys
came to see the musical.

21:04.869 --> 21:07.504
Look, these kids are ready
to bring the house down.

21:07.539 --> 21:08.756
How are you?
Tell us everything.

21:08.790 --> 21:10.424
Oh, life is crazy busy.

21:10.458 --> 21:12.543
You know, it's not easy
balancing UCLA classes

21:12.594 --> 21:14.545
and recording backup vocals

21:14.596 --> 21:16.013
or having Puckerman
always hit me up

21:16.047 --> 21:17.331
for sugar mamas' phone numbers.

21:17.349 --> 21:18.515
But life is good.
Good.

21:18.550 --> 21:20.050
Oh, you guys have to
come backstage and say hi.

21:20.101 --> 21:23.337
They're gonna freak
when they see who's here.

21:23.355 --> 21:25.356
Tina!

21:25.390 --> 21:28.392
I'm sorry... I've been starving
myself all week.

21:28.443 --> 21:30.194
How could you have gained
two inches in one day?

21:30.228 --> 21:33.013
I don't know. Maybe we can
hot glue an elastic band on.

21:33.031 --> 21:35.232
Marley, do not worry.
We're gonna get those

21:35.283 --> 21:37.451
two inches off you
before curtain.

21:37.485 --> 21:39.036
Scout's honor.

21:42.457 --> 21:44.875
(bell dinging)

21:48.296 --> 21:49.413
Kurt?

21:49.464 --> 21:51.382
I-I didn't

21:51.416 --> 21:53.550
think I'd see you this weekend.

21:53.585 --> 21:54.885
We wouldn't miss it
for the world.

21:54.919 --> 21:56.003
Would we Kurt?

21:57.639 --> 21:59.139
Rachel.

22:00.141 --> 22:01.342
Finn, hey.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.594
How are you?

22:03.645 --> 22:04.895
Good. A little...

22:04.929 --> 22:06.730
surprised to see you, but...

22:06.765 --> 22:09.733
I'm gonna go put the kids
through their warm-up.

22:12.687 --> 22:14.388
How are you?

22:14.406 --> 22:15.773
I'm good. I'm really good.

22:15.824 --> 22:17.441
Just... busy and...

22:17.492 --> 22:19.109
Rachel has her first
big audition

22:19.160 --> 22:20.611
for an
off-Broadway show next week.

22:20.662 --> 22:22.780
Wow.

22:22.831 --> 22:25.082
That's awesome.
Congratulations.

22:25.116 --> 22:26.450
Thanks.

22:31.122 --> 22:34.124
Look, this is... this is
really, really weird, Mm-hmm.

22:34.175 --> 22:35.509
But the four of us had

22:35.543 --> 22:37.261
a lot of history between us,

22:37.295 --> 22:39.430
so I just want to say...

22:39.464 --> 22:41.432
it's cool you came
to see our show.

22:53.895 --> 22:55.095
You were right.

22:55.113 --> 22:56.930
It was a mistake to come.

22:56.948 --> 22:58.866
I'm not gonna get direct to you.
Oh, no.

22:58.900 --> 22:59.867
Look, you're gonna
be fine, all right?

22:59.901 --> 23:01.151
I'm gonna be sitting
right next to you.

23:01.202 --> 23:03.537
And we're gonna be
holding hands and laughing

23:03.571 --> 23:05.038
and applauding,
and we are never, ever

23:05.073 --> 23:06.373
gonna let them see us sweat.

23:06.408 --> 23:09.126

(retching, coughing)

25:56.244 --> 25:57.327
Marley, stop.

25:57.362 --> 25:59.379
Why are you doing that?

25:59.414 --> 26:02.466
(crying)

26:02.500 --> 26:04.051
Why do you think?

26:04.085 --> 26:07.204
My mom's the town joke,

26:07.238 --> 26:10.123
and I'm going to end up
just like her.

26:10.141 --> 26:11.475
Well, sticking your fingers
down your throat

26:11.509 --> 26:12.726
is only gonna
make things worse.

26:12.760 --> 26:13.977
Spare me the lecture.

26:14.012 --> 26:15.228
I've seen the health films.

26:15.263 --> 26:17.064
Okay.

26:17.098 --> 26:19.566
Then Google "Johnny Pappas."

26:19.601 --> 26:20.817
He's my second cousin.

26:20.852 --> 26:22.019
He was a wrestler
at Bowling Green,

26:22.070 --> 26:23.236
and the coach was always
making him drop weight.

26:23.271 --> 26:25.072
So Johnny did
all the crazy diets

26:25.106 --> 26:27.157
and puked every day

26:27.191 --> 26:30.911
when that stopped working,
he used laxatives.

26:30.945 --> 26:33.363
Then last March, in the
middle of a match...

26:33.414 --> 26:35.015
He died?

26:36.834 --> 26:39.086
He crapped himself in front
of the whole school.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.505
(both laughing)

26:45.793 --> 26:48.211
I would never use laxatives.

26:48.262 --> 26:49.429
Well, I don't want
to kiss a girl

26:49.464 --> 26:50.664
who's got puke on her breath.

26:50.698 --> 26:55.102
Either on stage... or later.

26:56.854 --> 27:00.374
Now, come on, we're on in five.

28:15.272 --> 28:16.806
Hello.
Hi.

28:16.857 --> 28:19.191
I'm really so glad you came back
to play Rizzo.

28:19.226 --> 28:20.810
I feel bad for Mercedes,

28:20.861 --> 28:22.445
but if her parents want her
to be a boy

28:22.479 --> 28:23.896
then, I don't know,
I guess it makes sense.

28:25.315 --> 28:28.484
I miss you.

28:28.535 --> 28:30.653
I miss you, too.

28:30.704 --> 28:32.872
The only reason why I
agreed to do this play

28:32.906 --> 28:34.156
was so that I could see you again.

28:36.209 --> 28:40.129
Well, I'm not dating anybody
new, boy or girl.

28:40.163 --> 28:42.631
Brit, we talked about this.

28:42.666 --> 28:45.801
And it would be fine
if you were...

28:45.836 --> 28:48.337
I'm glad that you're not.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.141
60 seconds, Miss Lopez.

28:52.175 --> 28:53.476
(both chuckle)

28:53.510 --> 28:55.227
Ms. Lopez.

28:55.262 --> 28:58.147
Are you nervous
about your big number?

28:58.181 --> 29:00.816
Oh, God, no, come on,
it's all about the attitude.

29:00.851 --> 29:02.651
I'm just going to do what
I did with "America"

29:02.686 --> 29:03.986
in <i>West Side Story</i> last year.

29:04.021 --> 29:06.439
Yeah, but this is,
like, a sad song, right?

29:06.473 --> 29:07.823
So you have to think
of something

29:07.858 --> 29:09.775
that makes you,
like, really sad.

29:09.809 --> 29:11.494
Like how we're not together
anymore, and it's okay,

Finn was right... no one could

31:45.015 --> 31:48.434
You know, this last week,
I've been thinking...

31:48.468 --> 31:50.186
maybe we shouldn't
have broken up.

31:50.237 --> 31:52.438
Maybe it was premature.

31:52.472 --> 31:55.324
Maybe, but... we did.

31:55.358 --> 31:57.976
And it really tested who I am.

32:24.721 --> 32:27.223

your playdate with the hottest
piece of ass at NY

36:37.133 --> 36:39.134

Said hot ass was
lonely, distraught,

36:42.138 --> 36:43.689
didn't know what
to do with himself,

36:43.723 --> 36:46.007
and was more than happy
to come help me choreograph

36:46.025 --> 36:47.675
a new routine when I called him up,

36:47.694 --> 36:49.528
and then one thing led
to another

36:49.562 --> 36:52.180
and next thing you know he's
at my place and, you know...

37:59.426 --> 38:00.726
...and for you.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.112
You know, everything was
really, really good,

38:03.146 --> 38:07.066
and I had a couple of notes,
but they were small.

38:07.100 --> 38:08.234
(chuckles)

38:08.268 --> 38:09.718
Well, thank you for coming.

38:09.753 --> 38:11.153

Believe me, the whole 
time I was directing it,

38:14.274 --> 38:17.827

what would Rachel do?

38:17.861 --> 38:19.461

38:24.417 --> 38:26.952

38:27.003 --> 38:29.171

38:29.206 --> 38:31.957
I'd rather not.

38:33.677 --> 38:36.078
I wasn't crying about you.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.113

38:39.649 --> 38:41.600

38:41.635 --> 38:43.602
Brody?

38:43.637 --> 38:45.921
I-I just didn't think
you'd move on that fast.

38:45.939 --> 38:47.489
You don't know that.
I know you.

38:47.524 --> 38:49.925
I know you have four
different kinds of crying.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.810
You've got the fake crying
when you want something,

38:51.862 --> 38:54.480
which always involves a tissue,

38:54.531 --> 38:56.448
you've got the singing crying,
which this can't be,

38:56.483 --> 38:58.968
the disappointed crying,
which involves sobbing,

38:59.002 --> 39:00.786
and the crying over a guy,

39:00.820 --> 39:04.557
which I know very well because
it used to be reserved for me.

39:08.912 --> 39:10.880
Told you we shouldn't
talk about this.

39:10.914 --> 39:13.332
Well, maybe we shouldn't talk
about anything anymore.

39:14.551 --> 39:16.502

39:16.553 --> 39:17.670
Yeah.

39:19.923 --> 39:23.492
No contact, not even in song.

39:25.178 --> 39:27.129
When you come back
to visit, I...

39:27.147 --> 39:29.481
I don't want to know about it.

39:29.516 --> 39:33.986
Yeah, I think that's good.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.688

know what's going

39:35.690 --> 39:37.356
to happen between us but...,

39:37.407 --> 39:39.808
I know that you used to be
the guy who would make me feel

39:39.826 --> 39:44.029
like the most special girl
in the whole world,

39:44.080 --> 39:46.482
and it doesn't feel
that way anymore.

39:46.516 --> 39:52.504
Now it just feels...
sad and confusing.

39:52.539 --> 39:54.173
And the worst part is

39:54.207 --> 39:56.592
is that doesn't even really feel
that bad anymore.

39:58.578 --> 40:01.163
Made you cry, and...

40:01.197 --> 40:03.182
this doesn't.

40:04.467 --> 40:06.435
Hey.

40:06.469 --> 40:08.053

he wanted

40:08.104 --> 40:10.105

40:10.140 --> 40:11.774

40:14.527 --> 40:16.729

I just want to go home.

40:16.731 --> 40:20.566

40:36.967 --> 40:38.751

I didn't care.

40:40.920 --> 40:43.255
Do you think any of that
matters to me?

40:43.306 --> 40:46.041

41:15.789 --> 41:17.790
"they plucked stars
from the firmament

41:17.841 --> 41:19.908
"and named them Marley Rose
and Ryder Lynn.

41:19.926 --> 41:23.245
Has ever an audience been
so enraptured? Mayhap.

41:23.263 --> 41:26.248
"But when the last breath of life
crosses this reviewer's lips,"

41:26.266 --> 41:27.683
"it shall utter but three words:"

41:27.717 --> 41:30.102
<i>'Grease,</i> McKinley,

41:30.136 --> 41:31.136
"Bravo.'"

41:31.187 --> 41:33.455
(cheering, whooping)

41:33.490 --> 41:35.107
Whoo!
Whoo!

41:35.141 --> 41:36.591
Guys, Fletcher Mantini's
just a sophomore,

41:36.609 --> 41:38.260
but he's a notoriously 
tough critic.

41:38.278 --> 41:41.263
And that's what I call
a rave review.

41:41.281 --> 41:43.615
(all cheer, applaud)

41:43.650 --> 41:48.620
Man, this week hasn't been easy,
knowing it was the last time

41:48.655 --> 41:50.205
I was gonna see you guys
for a while.

41:50.240 --> 41:52.157
But one thing that's
helped is knowing that

41:52.208 --> 41:54.543
I'm leaving you in good hands.
Here's one person who loves

41:54.577 --> 41:56.378
the Glee Club as much as I do,
it's Finn.

41:56.413 --> 41:58.947
And I know in my heart
that he has what it takes

41:58.965 --> 42:00.466
to get you guys a win
at sectionals.

42:00.500 --> 42:04.053
I have so much
to thank you guys for.

42:06.806 --> 42:11.427
But for giving me this chance
to share that joy with others.

42:14.431 --> 42:16.631
I'm gonna see you guys
in a few months,

42:16.649 --> 42:18.967
but hopefully, there'll he
a brand-new sectionals trophy

42:18.985 --> 42:20.152
in that case over there.

42:21.571 --> 42:23.989
I love you guys.

42:24.023 --> 42:26.658
I'm really gonna miss you.

42:29.162 --> 42:31.029
I'm serious... you can call me
anytime, day or night.

42:31.081 --> 42:34.583
I know.
You okay?

42:34.617 --> 42:37.369
Yeah. You okay?

42:37.420 --> 42:39.037
Yeah.

42:39.089 --> 42:41.656
Oh, one more thing:
For sectionals,

42:41.674 --> 42:43.041
don't be afraid to open
with a ballad.

42:43.093 --> 42:44.993
Yeah, sure we got
a lot of great dancers now,

42:45.011 --> 42:46.995
but the judges at sectionals
always reward the best singers.

42:47.013 --> 42:48.263
So what you gotta do...

42:48.298 --> 42:50.999
Mr. Shue, I got this.

42:51.017 --> 42:53.385
(sighs)

42:53.436 --> 42:55.471
Yeah.

43:03.062 --> 43:04.029
Go get 'em.

43:04.063 --> 43:06.365
You, too.
