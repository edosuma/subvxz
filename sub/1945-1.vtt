00:35.452 --> 00:40.458
This is a story about
stick figures who live

00:40.624 --> 00:46.727
in a world full of monsters
and explosions and raccoons

00:47.089 --> 00:49.683
and a lot of other cool stuff too.

00:49.841 --> 00:53.562
And it all takes place
on a little planet we

00:53.720 --> 00:57.770
like to call Earth.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.105
There it is.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.700
Fart.
Who the fuck cares?

01:14.866 --> 01:18.329
I can't wait for lunch.
My god.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.059
Do you think there are going to
be boys at this school or what?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.712
Ew!
Boys have cooties.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.505
Audios, assholes.
I'm late for a rave.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.798
Yee!

01:31.842 --> 01:33.472
No!

01:33.635 --> 01:35.887
Not the Explosion Factory!

01:44.062 --> 01:45.863
Where'd you learn to walk...
cripple school?

01:45.981 --> 01:47.449
Nice!

01:47.608 --> 01:50.160
If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.571
Kiss my butt losers.
Hey, bitch.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.540
You want a pixie stick?
My mom says those turn you into a whore.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.085
Probably!
Hello, Blue!

01:58.243 --> 01:59.662
Hey, Lord Tourettes.
Wow!

01:59.828 --> 02:01.921
First day of class?
Yeah.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.007
Splendid!
Mine as well!

02:04.166 --> 02:06.385
Say, there's a young jerk
face looking for you.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.045
Says he wants to beat your
back until you die.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.302
Well, ta-ta.
Ha ha ha!

02:13.925 --> 02:16.391
Wee.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.688
Sup, bro.
You new here or what?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.853
Yeah.
First day.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.686
Must be 'cause otherwise you'd know
that this seesaw's for fifth graders.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.612
Sorry.
I didn't know.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.024
Yeah?

02:28.190 --> 02:31.489
Price for playing on the fifth grade
playground is your milk money.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.867
But I'm lactose intolerant.
Really?

02:38.033 --> 02:39.910
Well let's see if you're
fist-tose intolerant.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.802
What's the matter, blue kid?
My mom says I drink too much water.

02:45.874 --> 02:49.381
That's how come I cry so much and pee.
Gross!

02:51.963 --> 02:55.343
You know, I got held back five
years, but my muscles didn't.

02:58.303 --> 03:02.353
Old MacDonald had a farm, now
you're going to die, nerd!

03:05.727 --> 03:07.529
What is that?
Wow.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.490
Look, it's an asteroid!

03:26.707 --> 03:28.129
Sup?

03:28.291 --> 03:30.093
My god!

03:30.252 --> 03:32.925
Who is that?
It's a new kid!

03:33.088 --> 03:34.214
Get him!

04:54.211 --> 04:56.509
My god.
You're so sexy.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.008
I know.
Dude, you saved my life!

04:59.174 --> 05:00.557
I know.
What's your name?

05:00.717 --> 05:03.057
I know.
I mean, I'm Red.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.267
My name is Blue.

05:04.429 --> 05:08.938
No matter what happens, I promise
I will always be your friend.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.068
I know cuz I'm awesome!

06:18.712 --> 06:21.047
Gelato.
Mama mia!

06:34.978 --> 06:38.148
Come on, Blue, please.
I'm not going to tell you.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.817
Please, please, please.
No way.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.237
I got you the greatest birthday
present of all time.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.746
I'm not going to spoil the surprise.
You're such a jerk.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.166
My god!

06:48.325 --> 06:50.081
Wow!

06:50.243 --> 06:53.038
You a jerk and a wuss.
No.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.124
All right you pussy.

06:56.291 --> 06:59.673
I got to go to work.
See you later, Blue.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.305
I'll call you tonight.
Okay, smoopsie poo-poo pie.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.717
I can't wait to see what you
get me for my birthday.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.392
Hey, toots!
Go to hell, Red.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.432
Okay!
See you there!

07:08.595 --> 07:11.727
Gelato.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.855
Dude, this place is a dump.
You know where there is a dump?

07:15.018 --> 07:16.440
Your bed.
Ha ha ha!

07:16.603 --> 07:18.446
God dammit, dude.
Not again.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.857
Use the toilet!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.902
Gelatto.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.779
Mr. Dingleberry.

07:25.946 --> 07:29.457
You haven't paid rent in eight months.
My god.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.290
You're right.
Here, let me get my checkbook.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.374
Okay.
I'll just wait right here.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.918
Gelato.
Again.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.722
Expired, expired, rotten, poison.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.724
Dude, you've been playing that
first level for three hours.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.890
Can you really not make that jump?
I can make it.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.517
I just hate that little guy.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.979
Momma mia!
Move over.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.402
I've got a degree in advanced joystick
theory and I ain't afraid to use it.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.898
Yeah, I heard you practicing last night.
Olivia.

08:02.065 --> 08:05.614
Mon.
You do it for me every time.

08:05.777 --> 08:08.121
There, done with hand crocheted
towel of Olivia Mon.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.451
Time to jack off.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.413
Let me show you how this shit's done, son.
What the fuck?

08:12.575 --> 08:13.792
Who took the lights?

08:13.952 --> 08:16.462
I mean, we haven't paid the
electricity bill in seven months.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.669
We pay for electricity?
You don't!

08:18.832 --> 08:21.376
I do.
Wait!

08:21.543 --> 08:23.903
All of our food's going to go bad!
All of our food is bad!

08:26.381 --> 08:31.348
Can't let precious foods go to waste.
Dude, you know that's all expired?

08:34.222 --> 08:37.024
I don't care!
God.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.981
Not the milk!

08:39.144 --> 08:41.613
I'll keep you safe in
my belly, cow juice.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.610
I think I'm gonna vom.
Hey, listen.

08:43.773 --> 08:46.155
I, I got a big problem.
I totally just lied to Pink.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.441
Her birthday's next week and
I told her I got her the

08:50.447 --> 08:53.417
greatest gift of all time, but
I didn't get her anything!

08:53.575 --> 08:56.710
Give her this mayonnaise jar.
No.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.621
Come on.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.623
You know what girls like, right?
What should I get her?

08:59.789 --> 09:02.175
Hey, you should go see the raccoon...
See who?

09:02.333 --> 09:05.424
The rac...
What are you trying to say?

09:05.587 --> 09:09.842
I can only say so many
words before I...

09:10.008 --> 09:11.430
The raccoon!

09:12.927 --> 09:16.147
He's got the coolest stuff.

09:20.727 --> 09:21.694
Yesh!

09:21.853 --> 09:24.494
I don't know if I should get my
girlfriend a gift in the pawn shop.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.151
You should get her this cool hat!
Yeah, try it on.

09:28.318 --> 09:32.789
So, you want a
gift for your girlfriend, hey?

09:32.947 --> 09:33.243
Whoa.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.869
How'd you know?
You talk very loud.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.207
Fits perfect!

09:38.369 --> 09:43.003
Did you touch that fucking bear trap?
No.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.672
Idiot.
Um.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.553
So me and my girlfriend have
been dating a long time and I

09:47.712 --> 09:49.965
want to get her something
super romantic.

09:50.131 --> 09:54.799
I've got the perfect gift for you.
But first, a story.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.060
No!
People stories.

09:58.223 --> 10:04.271
A long time ago in ancient
Japan my country was at war.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.532
My small village was
all that was left.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.740
Knowing I may die in battle,
I gave my wife a symbol of

10:11.903 --> 10:15.157
undying love, a lotus flower.

10:15.323 --> 10:19.169
Armed with the weapon of my
ancestors, the Great Sword of

10:19.327 --> 10:22.957
Destiny, I'd have to
confront my fate.

10:23.123 --> 10:27.048
But the mighty beast, Ocho
Muerto, emerged from the sea

10:27.210 --> 10:30.464
and took my wife.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.304
I was too late.

10:33.466 --> 10:38.723
In my rage, I fought the
Tachigami Demon Army and slew

10:38.888 --> 10:42.313
ten hundred thousand
hundred warriors.

10:42.475 --> 10:48.107
Honorably, all that remain was
Armor Tachigami himself.

10:48.273 --> 10:52.369
Though he shattered the bread
and scattered it to the wind,

10:52.527 --> 10:56.748
as he lay dying he said
to me, fuck you.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.533
He was a douche bag.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.921
You may have won the battle,
raccoon, but the ghosts of my

11:03.079 --> 11:07.835
warriors will haunt the Great
Sword of Destiny forever!

11:08.001 --> 11:11.756
And with that he
died, but his curse remains

11:11.921 --> 11:17.677
guarding the sword against any who may
seek to use it's great power again.

11:17.844 --> 11:22.099
But the power of the bread was
too strong, even for me.

11:22.265 --> 11:26.691
And in the fury of battle, I
found I destroyed not only the

11:26.853 --> 11:31.404
Tachigami Demon Army,
but all of Japan!

11:31.566 --> 11:38.077
Dishonored, my kinsmen banished me
from my home never again to return.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.750
Sorry.
I was bored by my own story.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.040
Wait!
So where's the sword?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.967
There is only one left alive who knows.
Who?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.252
Hold up.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.421
Why the hell would I give Pink a sword?
This is retarded.

11:53.588 --> 11:54.805
No!

11:54.964 --> 11:59.769
Bring me the sword and in return, I shall
give you the greatest gift a girl...

11:59.928 --> 12:01.520
No!
A woman...

12:01.679 --> 12:02.726
No!

12:02.889 --> 12:06.109
A goddess could hope
to ever receive.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.977
Is it a dick?
Yes.

12:08.686 --> 12:09.770
Really?
No.

12:10.521 --> 12:11.818
You're very gullible.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.154
Well, who even knows
where it still is?

12:14.317 --> 12:17.196
You must find the man
who considers me his

12:17.362 --> 12:21.617
greatest enemy, my son, Son Sun.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.462
Nope.
You're weird.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.798
I'm just going to go buy her some flowers.
Shit, I'll find that sword.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.921
This sounds awesome.
What?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.347
Really?
Yeah, man.

12:37.507 --> 12:41.807
It's a 10,000-year-old sword hidden
in Japan guarded by demon ninjas.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.688
That's the most awesome thing
I've ever heard of!

12:43.846 --> 12:45.936
Dude, you're going to get yourself
killed going after that thing.

12:46.099 --> 12:46.975
Maybe.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.149
But at least I'm not a god damn Pussy!
I'm not a pussy!

12:51.312 --> 12:54.111
You are a pussy
with a capital vagina!

12:54.274 --> 12:56.868
I told you about the bread
because I thought you would

12:57.026 --> 13:01.031
have the courage to do something
extraordinary.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.073
Yeah, right.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.289
All he does all day is sit in his
room playing with his joystick.

13:05.451 --> 13:09.126
He'd totally get killed.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.546
Have fun staying home, man!
I'll send you a post card.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.386
This was a mistake.

13:15.545 --> 13:19.550
Only a true hero could find the
great sword of destiny.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.560
But I can see now, it is not you.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.434
You're wrong.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.144
Oh?
Yeah.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.654
I'm going to find the shit
out of that sword.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.361
It's going to be very dangerous.

13:35.523 --> 13:39.699
Good, pussy's hate danger
and I'm not a pussy.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.792
Give me that!
Aw, yeah!

13:45.950 --> 13:49.666
Time to get our quest on!
Woo!

13:56.294 --> 13:57.469
Okay.
Maybe I was wrong.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.090
This is pretty scary.
Seriously?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.724
Do you want to get Pink
a sick present or not?

14:01.883 --> 14:02.971
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.723
Let's go.
Aw, yeah.

14:04.886 --> 14:09.311
Follow my lead.
Crap.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.480
There's guards.
What do we do?

14:11.642 --> 14:13.652
Cartwheel.
Cartwheel?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.156
Holy shit!
Did you see that?

14:17.315 --> 14:19.609
No.
Me neither.

14:19.776 --> 14:20.868
Shew.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.912
Hey, you hiding behind those crates!
Cartwheel, dude!

14:25.573 --> 14:30.166
Where'd he go?
Damn cartwheels every time.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.545
Woo.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.456
See, how would you have
any fun without me?

14:33.623 --> 14:35.629
Reading is fun.
Your mom's fun.

14:37.043 --> 14:41.839
Now let's find ourselves a boat.
How about this one?

14:47.011 --> 14:48.137
It's perfect.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.895
Dude, let's just get on that one.
No way!

14:52.058 --> 14:55.857
Have you seen how awesome this thing is?
The guns have guns.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.610
This one's got boobs and beer.
Red?

14:58.773 --> 15:01.322
Boobs and beer!

15:01.484 --> 15:04.704
I'm going to regret this.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.114
Holt, bro.

15:06.280 --> 15:10.076
This booze cruise is for college
house dudes and dudettes only!

15:10.952 --> 15:14.460
Oh, holy shit!
You're that freshman 15 dude, dude.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.462
Didn't you, like, nail 15 freshman
chicks in, like, one night?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.089
Naked party!
Here we go!

15:19.252 --> 15:22.467
Woo!
Oh, shit!

15:22.630 --> 15:24.390
That's, like, four!
Fuck my life!

15:24.549 --> 15:25.596
Oh, yeah.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.561
That was back in my college years.
Can't believe this, only 15.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.187
Yes, bro.
Yes!

15:30.346 --> 15:33.729
That what I'm talking about!
Dude, welcome aboard bro dude bro.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.019
Keg's on the poop deck, babes
on the port side.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.564
Watch out for Neptune.
Party foul!

15:39.730 --> 15:41.240
Aw.
Whoa!

15:41.399 --> 15:43.404
Titties, here I come!
Oh, wow.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.203
That was away easy.
Halt, bro!

15:46.362 --> 15:50.037
This party train's sailing for Port Cool
so consider yourself the third wheel.

15:50.199 --> 15:50.791
Wait.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.310
But I thought we were cool?
You thought thinking was cool?

15:53.411 --> 15:54.537
Dude?

15:56.372 --> 15:59.049
What the hell?
Sorry, dude!

15:59.208 --> 16:03.053
Should have banged more freshmen chicks!
How the fuck am I going to get to Japan?

16:03.212 --> 16:06.932
Take your car, Stupid!
Hey!

16:07.091 --> 16:10.352
We only have room for one more pallet!
Should we load the beer or the life vests?

16:10.511 --> 16:12.976
Load the beer!
No regrets!

16:13.139 --> 16:14.061
No regrets!

16:20.229 --> 16:25.151
Let's get this party started.
Captain DJ, make that anchor drop.

16:31.782 --> 16:35.412
And so Red and Blue
took a booze cruise across the

16:35.578 --> 16:39.461
ocean blue, but they were attacked by
pirates and they were all beheaded!

16:39.624 --> 16:41.126
Just kidding.

16:41.292 --> 16:43.920
They all got sea scurvy and
died out of their butts.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.130
No.
These are all lies.

16:46.297 --> 16:51.018
Unfortunately, they made it to Japan.
But pirates sounded pretty cool, right?

16:51.177 --> 16:53.270
All right.
Here's Japan.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.973
Whoa!
All right!

17:10.029 --> 17:13.707
Dude, this place is so racist.
Pay phone, bitches.

17:15.284 --> 17:18.709
You ladies want to sumo wrestle?
I'm gonna die here.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.048
See ya, dudes! No regrets!

17:21.207 --> 17:23.876
No regrets, dudes!
Aw, so happy.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.693
I am so angry!

17:48.859 --> 17:51.658
I'm in danger of failing out
of Ninja Video Game Academy.

17:52.863 --> 17:56.451
I'm in love with him.
Fuck you.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.291
Why do the koi fish cr-cr-cry?

17:59.453 --> 18:03.965
Why do the koi fish die, die, die?
This place is too cartoony for me.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.548
Why do the koi fish cry, cry, cry?

18:06.711 --> 18:10.386
Da, da, da, da, da,
da, da, da, dead.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.216
Oh, sick!
Ramen.

18:12.383 --> 18:16.646
This this some crunchy ass rice.
Red, that's a bowl of tiny cell phones.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.517
I've had a lot of painful poops,
but this is gonna be a bad one.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.396
Yeah.
Good luck with that.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.318
You need the directions?
Oh yeah.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.566
Wow.
That would be great.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.744
Thanks!
Um.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.422
We're trying to get to this restaurant.
Do you know it?

18:34.488 --> 18:35.285
Ha.
He.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.705
Are you okay?

18:42.163 --> 18:43.585
What is wrong with her face?

18:49.462 --> 18:49.962
Yeah.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.723
You are extremely unhelpful.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.110
Oh, my god.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.961
All those animes
were documentaries.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.946
That sushi restaurant better be close.
I'm hungry for some more cell phones.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.959
Dude, I think we're here.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.678
How are we going to know what
the racoon's kid even looks like?

19:30.836 --> 19:33.847
Please, have a seat.
Guess he's not here.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.890
Can I help you?

19:39.804 --> 19:43.899
We... we've traveled a long
way to find this village.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.861
Do you know the raccoon?
The raccoon?

19:48.020 --> 19:53.193
I hate that guy.
His voice sounds so stupid, right, guys?

19:53.359 --> 19:54.861
Ha, ha, ha.
Totally.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.706
Eat your noodles.
I don't want to eat my noodles!

19:58.864 --> 20:03.085
I am Son Sun,
son of Papa Sun, the one you

20:03.244 --> 20:07.048
call the raccoon.
What?

20:07.206 --> 20:11.677
This is my wife, Wife Sun,
and my son, Grand Son Sun.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.760
Raccoon looks nothing
like his family.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.391
A family he
abandoned when he dishonored

20:17.550 --> 20:20.645
the mighty Japan with the
Greatest Sword of Destiny.

20:20.803 --> 20:25.525
It was too powerful for him and
you will never find it!

20:26.726 --> 20:28.103
Oh, this is some bullshit!

20:28.269 --> 20:31.694
I want some god damn sushi!

20:31.856 --> 20:35.656
I will cut the sushi
after I cut you!

20:38.738 --> 20:42.750
Wasabi!
A spicy seaweed!

20:43.826 --> 20:45.294
Miso!

20:46.495 --> 20:50.299
Hot tea!
Fuck you!

20:50.458 --> 20:51.508
Ooh!
Okay.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.919
I will make you sushi.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.392
Oh, thank Godzilla.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.224
I think I like the
cell phones better.

21:02.386 --> 21:06.891
So the raccoon, Papa Sun, said that
you'd know where to find the sword.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.737
I swore an oath
that I would never reveal

21:08.851 --> 21:12.108
the location of the weapon so it may
never fall into his hands again.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.731
Oh, no.
It's not for the raccoon.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.321
It's for me.
Well, that's fine.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.684
It's just up at that mountain.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.495
Nope.

21:27.661 --> 21:31.374
Whoa!
Red Sun, you're so fat.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.588
I had a whole bowl of cell
phones for lunch.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.424
That explains it.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.138
Oh, sick.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.679
Damn, I bet they got hella
swords in there.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.477
Hey.
Hey, why you no pay?

21:50.518 --> 21:52.486
Mr. Makasan, you stop!
Very dangerous!

21:52.645 --> 21:54.738
You go no further!
Sorry, man.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.498
We're kind of getting our quest on.
Yeah.

21:56.524 --> 21:57.645
Don't worry about it, pussy.

21:57.650 --> 22:02.201
Getting my quest on, singing
the quest song.

22:02.363 --> 22:03.781
Red!
Dude, wait!

22:03.948 --> 22:06.201
All the girls are like... -
Who's that brave ass dude?

22:06.367 --> 22:08.415
It's mother fucking
Red in the Temple of Doom,

22:08.577 --> 22:11.421
boulders, air, roach,
snakes and spiders.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.083
I'm not scared of anything,
not even fire.

22:14.250 --> 22:18.262
A creepy ass castle and a mountain mask,
walking right inside and I'm kicking it's ass.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.432
Aw, a splinter.

22:25.594 --> 22:29.394
This place might be dangerous
after all.

22:29.557 --> 22:32.101
Whoa.
There it is.

22:32.268 --> 22:33.645
Man, that little panda was right.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.623
My god.
That's a bad one.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.704
Evasive maneuvers.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.931
It's just the hilt of the sword!
The what of the sword?

23:03.090 --> 23:05.764
It's just the handle!
That sucks.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.143
You think?

23:07.303 --> 23:09.305
We came all this way for
the god damn handle!

23:09.471 --> 23:13.063
Man, this is a cool drawing.
It's got, like, all three condiments.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.020
You mean continents?
Yeah.

23:16.186 --> 23:19.565
There's squiggle, super
squiggle and America.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.822
Which one are we are now?
We're on squiggle!

23:22.985 --> 23:25.996
So there's two pieces left?
I guess so.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.031
I don't fucking know.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.675
Oh, hey, guys.
Sup?

23:42.838 --> 23:45.512
We are the Tachigami Demon Army.

23:45.674 --> 23:50.601
Our blades burn like fire and
our fire stings like ice and

23:50.763 --> 23:54.438
our ice is really fucking cold.

23:54.600 --> 23:58.025
We are cursed to protect the
Great Sword of Destiny from

23:58.187 --> 24:01.657
anyone who seek to use
its might power.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.692
We don't want to use it.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.157
I-, I just wanted a birthday
present for my girlfriend.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.323
Then we shall kill her too
because she will have the sword.

24:09.490 --> 24:12.372
Wait dude.
Can't we talk about this?

24:12.534 --> 24:18.798
The only thing we're going to talk
about is, how that you're about to be!

24:18.958 --> 24:21.009
Crack this!
This party sucks!

24:21.168 --> 24:23.754
Run for it!
Seize their swords!

24:23.921 --> 24:26.891
From our point of view, they
are the villains, not us!

24:27.049 --> 24:30.303
He's supposed to be rational
from our side of the story!

24:30.469 --> 24:32.221
Dude, that's just cra!

24:32.388 --> 24:33.685
Stop running your mouth and
start running your legs!

24:33.847 --> 24:36.479
Why?
Are the cops coming?

24:36.642 --> 24:37.142
Yes.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.072
This is all your fault!

24:46.235 --> 24:47.953
I don't know why I ever let
you talk me into this!

24:48.112 --> 24:50.076
You shut up!
The cops are coming!

24:50.239 --> 24:52.040
They're not cops!
They're demons!

24:52.741 --> 24:53.663
Really?

24:53.826 --> 24:56.787
Why do demons scare you less than cops?
Demons don't have guns.

25:12.386 --> 25:14.187
I should have never gone
on this stupid quest.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.464
I would have been better off
getting her that bear trap.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.770
You mean that sweet hat?

25:51.091 --> 25:52.263
Red, come on!

26:01.435 --> 26:04.988
Be very careful with that dynamite.
It's going to the Explosion Factory.

26:23.207 --> 26:26.339
Holy crap, we made it.
And we're floating away!

26:26.502 --> 26:27.845
What you talkin' about?

26:28.003 --> 26:29.844
I mean, the tides are carrying
us out to sea!

26:29.880 --> 26:33.347
Aw, yea!
Bermuda Triangle, here we come!

26:33.509 --> 26:35.602
Well, what are we going to do?
I don't know.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.855
But hey, at least we got sushi.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.976
See ya, Japan!
You stink crazy!

26:47.815 --> 26:50.401
Row boat trip!
Woo!

26:50.567 --> 26:52.160
Would you shut up?

26:52.319 --> 26:54.087
I don't know if you've noticed or
not, but we're in some deep shit.

26:54.154 --> 26:57.328
I think it's called a rowboat.
That isn't funny!

26:57.491 --> 26:58.743
We're stuck in the middle of
the ocean with only the hilt

26:58.909 --> 27:01.753
of this stupid sword and now we're going
to die out here and miss Pink's birthday!

27:01.912 --> 27:04.082
I don't know why you're doing all
this crazy stuff for her any way.

27:04.248 --> 27:05.962
Who cares?
She's just a girl!

27:06.125 --> 27:09.215
Well, I love her, okay.
That's why!

27:09.378 --> 27:12.678
What does that mean?

27:12.840 --> 27:15.684
Wait, you really don't
know what love means?

27:15.843 --> 27:16.935
Course you don't.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.722
It's this feeling you get
when you see someone.

27:19.888 --> 27:24.188
Deep down inside of you your heart starts
pumping and you just feel happy all over.

27:24.351 --> 27:27.483
It's the strongest most wonderful
feeling you can have for someone.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.489
So you mean a boner?
No!

27:29.648 --> 27:32.618
Dude, I'm in love all day.
You are such an idiot!

27:32.776 --> 27:34.216
I wouldn't do all this for a boner.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.037
I'd just go online and look
up pictures of your mom.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.698
Shut up!

27:37.865 --> 27:40.106
I'm doing this because I think
she's in love with me too.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.868
No way, man.
She likes me.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.167
What?
Yeah, dude.

27:44.329 --> 27:47.795
She's always giving me those dirty looks.
Because she hates you!

27:47.958 --> 27:51.135
Red, not every girl in the world
thinks you're cool, hot shit.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.717
Yeah they do.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.765
Why do you think I beat up all those
bullies back in kindergarten?

27:54.923 --> 28:00.100
To save my life.
What?

28:00.262 --> 28:01.605
No.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.640
Dude, I was trying to
impress all those chicks.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.433
What?

28:04.600 --> 28:06.898
Yeah, worked pretty good too.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.983
You've beaten me up,
embarrassed me, screwed my

28:09.146 --> 28:11.569
ex-girlfriends, crapped in my
bed, stolen my shit, eaten my

28:11.732 --> 28:13.279
food and taken my money for years!

28:13.442 --> 28:15.723
I stayed friends with you this
whole time because for some

28:15.736 --> 28:19.081
reason I actually thought
you were my friend too!

28:19.239 --> 28:23.327
Wow, you must feel pretty stupid.
Fuck you!

28:28.457 --> 28:30.050
You're such an asshole!

28:30.209 --> 28:32.844
I can't believe you let me think
we were actually friends!

28:33.003 --> 28:38.225
Well maybe I'd be friends with you if you
weren't such a god damn loser all the time!

28:38.383 --> 28:39.885
I'm a loser?

28:40.052 --> 28:43.939
I caught you masturbating to Animal Planet!
That was one time!

28:44.097 --> 28:48.102
You're just racist
against elephants!

28:48.268 --> 28:51.522
I can't believe I stuck by
your side for 20 god damn years!

28:51.688 --> 28:54.274
I'm not your friend anymore!
Good!

28:54.441 --> 28:56.026
I'm not yours!
Great.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.244
Awesome!
Good.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.528
I'm glad.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.029
Hey, baby.
This one's for you.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.777
Oh, my god.
Who is that?

29:38.527 --> 29:40.871
Yea.

29:41.029 --> 29:44.454
So, what are you
doing after recess?

29:49.913 --> 29:52.416
Holy shit.
Red.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.593
Red, are you dead?
Naw, man.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.798
Just tannin' my back.
God damn it.

29:58.964 --> 30:03.686
Where are we?
We're in paradise, mon!

30:03.844 --> 30:06.058
No, we're not!
We're on a deserted island!

30:06.221 --> 30:08.770
We should really sail to
dinner island first.

30:08.932 --> 30:12.019
No, deserted island... my god.
Is there a burrito island?

30:12.185 --> 30:14.981
That sounds way better.
Oh, my god.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.324
Oh, my god.
I'm actually going to die.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.243
I'm going to die next to an asshole and
I'll never see Pink's boobs again.

30:20.402 --> 30:23.196
Yeah, and I'm getting real worried
this place doesn't have internet.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.328
Oh, shit.
Maybe...

30:25.490 --> 30:27.205
Oh, no.
Where's my phone?

30:27.367 --> 30:28.914
Wait, dude!

30:29.077 --> 30:30.269
Didn't you eat a bowl full of
tiny cell phones for lunch?

30:30.329 --> 30:31.125
Oh. yeah!

30:35.792 --> 30:36.714
Come on.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.299
Nope.
Dude.

30:40.714 --> 30:41.840
It's not coming out.

30:45.302 --> 30:48.896
Here, let me try.
Not so hard, asshole.

30:49.056 --> 30:52.518
How about this?
Stop it.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.358
Let me just to dial it
with my butt muscles.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.026
Yup, this is my nightmare.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.955
It's ringing!
I can't believe I'm doing this.

31:06.114 --> 31:10.540
If you fart, I'll kill you.
Careful, if I fart, I'll kill you.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.999
Hello.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.005
You've reached Global Rescue
Services, ready to rescue you

31:14.164 --> 31:17.092
wherever you are, especially if
you're stuck on a deserted island.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.217
Hello.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.220
Can you hear me?
Well, hello yourself baby.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.972
You can rescue me anytime.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.928
What are you wearing?
What are you doing?

31:24.091 --> 31:25.596
Oh, you know.
Just bored at work.

31:25.759 --> 31:28.265
I get off at 7 if you want to
meet up at Burrito Island then.

31:29.971 --> 31:32.690
Oh, my god!

31:33.809 --> 31:35.607
I think I broke the phone.

31:36.645 --> 31:40.323
Screw you!
That is it!

31:40.482 --> 31:43.197
Where are you going?
Home.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.658
You can finish this god damn
quest on your own.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.243
I knew you were a pussy!

31:51.076 --> 31:53.420
This was the stupidest idea.

31:53.578 --> 31:57.917
Stupid lame ass Blue.
That sword is gonna be tight.

31:58.083 --> 32:03.263
Gettin' my beach on, singing the beach song,
hoping that a crab doesn't nibble my balls.

32:18.854 --> 32:22.649
This place is paradise.
The sun is so warm.

32:22.816 --> 32:24.238
The water's so clear.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.120
The sand, like diamonds
beneath my feet.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.907
The air smells sweet, like...
smoke?

32:32.659 --> 32:33.785
Red!

32:40.876 --> 32:43.469
Red, what did you do?
What?

32:43.628 --> 32:46.631
Oh, that.
You ruin everything!

32:46.798 --> 32:50.686
It's not that bad.
We're going to be burned alive!

32:50.844 --> 32:53.313
What is that?
King Kong!

32:53.472 --> 32:55.940
Is-is that a plane?
Bees!

32:56.099 --> 32:57.567
Holy shit!
It is a plane!

32:58.351 --> 33:00.236
Sky demon!
Ha, ha, ha.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.902
Cheerio old chaps.
Grab a hold!

33:21.291 --> 33:23.885
Perfectly executed signal
fire old chaps.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.466
Spotted it a fort night away.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.382
Still, damn shame you
burned down Burrito Island.

33:28.548 --> 33:32.552
That was Burrito Island?
No!

33:32.719 --> 33:36.518
Maybe it was Boobie Island.
No!

33:36.681 --> 33:38.228
Who are you?

33:38.391 --> 33:41.110
You're flying with Captain
Major Lieutenant Crookygrin,

33:41.269 --> 33:45.445
Private First Class Retired.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.318
You're a pilot?
And an alcoholic.

33:48.485 --> 33:51.284
1,000 flights, 1,000 crashes,
perfect record.

33:54.407 --> 33:55.958
Woop.
Wa-Wa-whomp.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.583
Trying to flip us over you old bitch.
Did I mention I'm blind?

33:58.745 --> 34:00.755
Alcohol blindness.
Ha ha.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.125
You and me both, brotha.
Woo.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.383
Ha ha ha.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.384
What are you doing flying
all the way out here?

34:06.419 --> 34:08.170
On my way to Gay Paris.

34:08.338 --> 34:11.683
I'm meeting an old friend from
the war, Colonel Dingleberry.

34:11.841 --> 34:12.763
Mr. Dingleberry?

34:15.387 --> 34:16.855
He was a private when I knew him.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.562
Haven't seen him since D-Day,
or Dingle Day as he

34:19.724 --> 34:20.065
liked to call it.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.397
Ha ho.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.688
We are on a top secret mission
to stop two blokes from

34:23.853 --> 34:26.150
finding the Great Sword of Destiny.

34:26.313 --> 34:27.907
What two blokes?

34:28.065 --> 34:29.818
The dossier said their
names were, what

34:29.985 --> 34:33.909
was it, Red and Blue.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.701
Say, tell an old blind
man your names.

34:37.867 --> 34:41.670
Tom.
And Tom.

34:41.830 --> 34:45.505
Tom and Tom, not enough Toms in the
world I've always said, by jove.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.842
Jeff.
For sure.

34:48.003 --> 34:52.844
This mission's important to me lads,
so important that I've quite drinking.

34:55.719 --> 34:59.355
In fact, I think my alcohol blindness
is being cured as we speak.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.859
I-, I think I see a cloud
and an eagle... bastard.

35:03.018 --> 35:05.445
My god, the sun.
Oh, shit.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.654
He's gonna see us.
What do we do?

35:06.813 --> 35:11.777
Run away, man.
Dude, we're screwed.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.613
Maybe not.
You thinking what I'm thinking?

35:14.779 --> 35:15.996
Never.

35:16.156 --> 35:18.450
We just get this guy sloshed and
he'll be as blind as a pelican.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.832
Pelicans aren't blind.
Come on.

35:20.994 --> 35:23.913
Here, Crooky a toast, for good luck.
No.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.798
No.
I mustn't have a drop.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.550
The fate of the queen
depends on it.

35:27.709 --> 35:30.886
Wouldn't be very proper to turn
down a shot of English gin, would it?

35:31.046 --> 35:35.467
Bitch, proper's my middle name.
Woo-hoo!

35:35.634 --> 35:37.978
Tally-ho!

35:38.136 --> 35:41.064
See, I told you this was a bad idea!
Whoa.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.816
Dude, you're a lightweight.
Balderdash!

35:43.975 --> 35:46.940
I know that sound.
Gentlemen, we're under attack.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.908
Holy Crap.
Are you serious?

35:52.067 --> 35:55.324
Don't worry chaps.
There's a 50-cal on the top turns.

35:55.487 --> 35:59.499
One of you old boys be a sport and fend
off those jerries for old pip, will you?

35:59.658 --> 36:01.334
All right.
You shoot the machine gun.

36:01.493 --> 36:05.463
I'll keep the old guy flying the plane blind.
That is the worst plan I've ever heard.

36:05.622 --> 36:09.668
All right, fine.
But in case I die, I still hate you.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.234
I hope they shoot you in the face!

36:19.886 --> 36:22.768
Seize their souls!
Oh, shit!

36:22.931 --> 36:24.433
Jet packed demon ninjas!

36:24.599 --> 36:28.069
We've toasted to you, so now
we got to toast to me.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.901
Well, it's only customary.
To Tom.

36:31.064 --> 36:33.153
Who?
Okay.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.488
I got this.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.215
Nice evasive maneuvers.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.971
You'll leave my mother out
of this, you twat.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.932
To mothers.
Everybody's got a mother.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.217
Your mom's got a mother.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.822
Oh, my god.
I just puked.

37:16.985 --> 37:19.283
Don't get cocky!
Crooky.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.623
No!

37:32.625 --> 37:35.553
Hey, Red.
What's your favorite animals?

37:35.712 --> 37:39.674
I like the color green a lot, but also the
bathroom because that's where you can barf.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.808
Hey!
Hey, I got the last one!

37:44.971 --> 37:46.689
You guys see that?
Of course, you didn't.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.439
You guys see that?

37:51.519 --> 37:52.816
Pull up!
We're gonna crash!

37:52.979 --> 37:54.899
Are you hungry?
You got to pull up right now!

37:54.981 --> 37:56.107
We're going to crash!

38:15.877 --> 38:18.592
Everyone okay?
I'm fine.

38:18.755 --> 38:22.016
I... I'm dying.
Oh, shit!

38:22.175 --> 38:23.222
Oh, god.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.723
Here.
Take this.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.142
What is it?

38:30.308 --> 38:32.777
You two must finish my mission now.

38:32.936 --> 38:37.281
Stop those bastards, Red and Blue, from
finding the Great Sword of Destiny.

38:37.440 --> 38:42.037
It's hidden on top
La Toure Eiffel.

38:42.195 --> 38:43.951
What?
What does that mean?

38:44.113 --> 38:47.208
I'm counting on you my
dear Tom and Tom.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.248
No, wait!
What is La Tour Eiffel?

38:49.410 --> 38:52.664
Another flight, another crash...

38:52.831 --> 38:55.960
perfect record.

38:57.126 --> 38:59.549
Now, tally-ho.

38:59.712 --> 39:01.760
May the eagles carry
you up to heaven.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.142
That dude's gonna have
a hangover tomorrow.

39:05.301 --> 39:08.809
Woo-wee.
Dude, wait!

39:08.972 --> 39:12.854
Since it looks like we're stuck
together, we may as well work together.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.298
I mean, I guess it was pretty
sharp shooting up there with

39:15.311 --> 39:17.780
those ninjas, even though
you barfed like a loser.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.482
Shut up.
Come on.

39:19.649 --> 39:23.779
Let's go find that blade.
Check please.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.447
Ooh la la.
Yeah.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.534
I'm going to probe this waitress
for information.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.544
Wait, you're going to do what?
Red, where are you going?

39:40.503 --> 39:42.802
Pick up!
Pick up!

39:42.964 --> 39:45.133
Hey, it's Blue.
Just text me.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.393
No one listens to voice mails.
Hey, Blue.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.475
It's Pink.

39:49.637 --> 39:53.558
Just calling you for the hundredth time.
Wh-where have you been?

39:53.725 --> 39:57.478
Mailbox full, you crazy.
Damn it.

40:01.733 --> 40:03.653
I'm going to cut you, fool!
I'm going to cut you!

40:09.449 --> 40:11.868
Sup, bitch.
Hey, Stacy.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.662
You haven't seen Red
around have you?

40:13.828 --> 40:16.081
Blue hasn't been answering his
phone for, like, two days.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.209
Who's Red?
That guy you have sex with every day.

40:21.669 --> 40:24.297
Which one?
The one with the hat.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.344
Oh, Steven.
Sup, babe.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.386
Ready for round trace?
Never mind.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.304
Red, when did you get that hat?

40:35.058 --> 40:38.653
Sorry we couldn't meet again,
old Crookygrin but I'm sure

40:38.811 --> 40:41.856
I'll see you soon.
I'm super old.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.154
Are you sure it was Rouge and Blue?
Oh, yup.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.361
They went that away.
Fantastic.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.870
We will find them no matter what.

40:49.614 --> 40:53.873
Comb the area and your
mustaches, especially you, Jaque.

40:54.035 --> 40:55.207
Oui.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.589
Excellent work,
Colonel Dingleberry.

41:01.751 --> 41:06.013
The sword is safe thanks to you.
You said I'd get a reward.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.549
And you shall.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.969
You'll be seeing your
friend, Crookygrin,

41:11.135 --> 41:13.763
sooner than you think!

41:13.930 --> 41:15.724
Oh, shit.
Should have seen that coming.

41:17.850 --> 41:18.897
Yeah.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.188
Let me show you how to French kiss.

41:21.354 --> 41:24.824
Why don't you show me
your toure felle instead?

41:24.983 --> 41:27.071
Ha ha ha ha.
What?

41:27.235 --> 41:28.907
Red, what are you doing?
Beat it, man.

41:29.070 --> 41:33.576
Kind of having a
private moment here.

41:33.741 --> 41:38.668
Garson, there seems to be
an asshole in our soup.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.708
Dude, Tachigami and those
ninjas could still be out there.

41:41.874 --> 41:44.718
We've got to find La Tour Eiffel.
Don't worry about him.

41:44.877 --> 41:47.596
Why don't you es car go get
us a bottle of wine?

41:59.892 --> 42:02.649
Don't forget that bottle of wine!
Seriously?

42:02.812 --> 42:05.940
We don't have time for this?
Have you seen this place?

42:06.107 --> 42:11.325
There's wine and women everywhere!
We're in paradise monsieur!

42:11.487 --> 42:14.741
Nope, this is Paris and we got to find
that stupid blade and get out of here.

42:16.075 --> 42:18.328
Why are you always bossing
everybody around?

42:18.494 --> 42:20.167
What are you, the king of Europe?

42:20.329 --> 42:22.957
I just don't have time for
another interruption.

42:23.124 --> 42:30.979
Rumors, rumors, in France
it's called frommage.

42:31.340 --> 42:35.390
It isn't a mirage.
And it...

42:40.767 --> 42:45.819
Bagette, bagette,
it looks just like a duck!

42:45.980 --> 42:50.781
You bake it in the oven and it
smells just like a shit!

42:50.943 --> 42:56.658
Because France's favorite meal
is duck baby cheese power fuck.

42:59.035 --> 43:02.129
Whoa.
I swear, it's just like my son.

43:02.288 --> 43:04.339
Dude, is that Lord Tourettes?
Well hello!

43:04.499 --> 43:08.044
Butt fuckers!
Yeah, that's Lord Tourettes.

43:08.211 --> 43:11.380
Dude, what are you doing in Paris?
Playing the accordion.

43:11.547 --> 43:16.891
But why are you in Paris?
To play the accordion!

43:17.053 --> 43:22.230
Garcon, I believe there's
an accordion in our soup.

43:22.391 --> 43:25.486
Garcon, I believe there
is a man in our soup.

43:25.645 --> 43:30.609
What are you two doing here?
We're here to play the accordion too!

43:30.775 --> 43:31.992
Really?
No.

43:32.151 --> 43:34.491
Wait, we're not?
No.

43:34.654 --> 43:37.828
We're trying to find something
called La Tour Eiffel.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.867
La Tour Eiffel?

43:41.202 --> 43:45.916
You must mean, the Eiffel Tower!
That's what it is?

43:46.082 --> 43:50.757
Reg, is retarded!
Spread out.

43:50.920 --> 43:55.683
Find those assholes, Rouge and Blue.
And kill them.

43:56.217 --> 43:57.469
Get down.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.730
I'm always getting down,
down, down, down.

44:00.888 --> 44:04.858
No one kills a mime in my town.
Stop it.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.189
Now the French police are
trying to kill us too.

44:06.352 --> 44:09.150
This quest sucks.
Whose dumb idea was this?

44:09.313 --> 44:13.243
Yours, numb nuts.
Now shut up and hide.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.204
Shit!
Waiter.

44:17.363 --> 44:19.706
Do you work here?
We ordered crab legs.

44:19.866 --> 44:24.044
Oh, why yes you did.
They're right here.

44:24.203 --> 44:28.128
Waiter, have you seen these two men?
Our crab legs?

44:31.752 --> 44:32.628
Yesh.

44:32.795 --> 44:37.847
You food looks delicious.

44:38.009 --> 44:41.104
Mama, the crap's legs
won't come off.

44:41.262 --> 44:44.894
You must first crack the shell.
There you go.

44:45.057 --> 44:45.979
Take a bite.

44:50.271 --> 44:54.074
My, your food is cooked so fresh.
It is still crying.

44:54.233 --> 44:58.245
May I try a bite?
Please, it is too much for us.

45:04.577 --> 45:09.791
It is rather tender.
It's our, most famous dish.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.008
Ha ha.
Men!

45:11.167 --> 45:12.009
Men!

45:12.168 --> 45:14.045
You must come over
and try this crab.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.845
Monsieur, we have finished
our sweep.

45:22.011 --> 45:24.264
Rouge and Blue are nowhere
to be found.

45:24.430 --> 45:25.852
Very well.

45:26.015 --> 45:29.818
We'll return tonight for dinner and
make sure you have plenty of crab.

45:31.687 --> 45:34.236
Check the next restaurant.

45:37.610 --> 45:40.780
Take me back to the ocean.
Come on, dude.

45:40.947 --> 45:42.347
Be quiet and we can
get out of here.

45:44.408 --> 45:46.706
Did that crab just fart?

45:46.869 --> 45:50.794
Crabs do not have butt holes!

45:51.582 --> 45:53.797
Don't let them eat me!
Open fire!

45:58.172 --> 46:00.766
Hurry, you got to get out of here!
Get in!

46:00.925 --> 46:03.769
I'm going to hot wire this. Shit!

46:03.928 --> 46:05.475
Come on.
Come on.

46:05.638 --> 46:07.894
I'm not going to jail again!
Ha ha ha ha!

46:08.057 --> 46:09.183
Thank god!

46:09.350 --> 46:10.602
Lord Tourettes, can you get
us to the Eiffel Tower?

46:10.768 --> 46:14.321
You bet your sweet ass!
Now buckle the fuck up!

46:14.480 --> 46:16.027
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!

46:20.778 --> 46:22.822
Alert all units.
Get me everything.

46:27.785 --> 46:28.707
Freeze, Americans!

46:46.095 --> 46:46.971
I'll be back!

46:53.060 --> 46:53.936
Woo!

47:18.627 --> 47:19.549
Get your umbrellas!

47:28.763 --> 47:29.980
Take the wheel, bitch!

47:39.690 --> 47:40.816
Ha.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.395
Where are we going?
Follow me.

48:13.557 --> 48:15.855
I'll will guide you to
the cock of Paris.

48:16.018 --> 48:19.362
The what of what?
Chases are great.

48:35.496 --> 48:36.372
Red!

48:39.750 --> 48:42.503
Gotcha.

48:42.670 --> 48:46.465
Holy crap.
I almost died.

48:46.632 --> 48:51.516
You're welcome, mother fucker.
Grab on!

49:02.857 --> 49:06.360
There it is, the Tour Eiffel.
Ha ha ha ha.

49:11.073 --> 49:14.623
One fact, this tower was
erected in 1889.

49:14.785 --> 49:15.911
Gross.

49:20.332 --> 49:23.006
Oh, crap.
They got us surrounded!

49:23.169 --> 49:24.469
Ha!
You are surrounded!

49:24.628 --> 49:28.049
Get off of our cock!
You get off of my cock, dick!

49:28.924 --> 49:32.011
How dare you!
Be careful, he curses well.

49:32.178 --> 49:34.178
LT, can you hold them off
while we get the blade?

49:34.263 --> 49:39.269
Leave it to me!
Come on.

49:39.435 --> 49:40.898
Oh, my god.
I'm out of shape.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.859
Dude, I'm like King Kong.

49:43.022 --> 49:46.697
How about a little lullaby?

49:46.859 --> 49:48.782
Go to sleep.

49:48.944 --> 49:54.872
Let the tea with dreams
of fresh baguettes.

49:55.034 --> 49:59.335
Drink some wine my sweetheart.

49:59.497 --> 50:01.340
I've got fucking ass sharts!

50:02.458 --> 50:05.507
I am becoming very la sleepy.

50:09.715 --> 50:11.092
Eat talking shit at the house.

50:11.258 --> 50:14.979
Lullaby will make you sleep.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.640
I said Tourettes, you're
the fucking dick!

50:24.605 --> 50:27.816
Now what?
Stick it in.

50:27.983 --> 50:31.028
Stick it in.
You're such a creep.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.835
Wow.

50:38.994 --> 50:43.336
Two pieces down, one left to go.
I wonder what that last piece is.

50:43.499 --> 50:48.133
I hope it's a dragon.
I really don't think it's a dragon.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.297
Oh, splendid.
You found it.

50:50.464 --> 50:52.432
Yeah, but we're still missing
that last piece.

50:52.591 --> 50:54.976
Oh, wait... the letter.
Damn it.

50:55.135 --> 50:57.972
It's in French.
I can read it.

50:58.138 --> 51:01.142
It says, the last piece
of the sword is...

51:01.308 --> 51:03.026
Shh.

51:03.185 --> 51:03.981
Gem.

51:04.144 --> 51:09.157
It's a gem and it's hidden in ax...
in a mountain behind your...

51:11.652 --> 51:13.453
Home town.
Fantastic.

51:13.612 --> 51:15.997
Really?
Yeah.

51:16.156 --> 51:19.330
That's super convenient.
Good f... f... luck you two.

51:19.493 --> 51:23.835
I hope you find your destiny.
Aw, man.

51:23.998 --> 51:25.920
Thanks, Lord Tourettes.
See ya.

51:26.083 --> 51:29.211
Audios, little green man.
Avior, mother fuckers!

51:33.674 --> 51:36.886
Ho ho ho.
Run!

51:37.052 --> 51:41.023
Don't let them get away.
They have defiled France's cock!

51:41.181 --> 51:45.061
That sword will be mine!

51:53.277 --> 51:56.747
And so, Red and Blue
escaped from the Tachigami

51:56.905 --> 52:00.000
Demon Army and the French
police and took a long

52:00.159 --> 52:04.460
convoluted map journey home to
find the last piece of the

52:04.622 --> 52:09.677
Great Sword of Destiny so Blue could get
Pink a birthday present, or something.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.720
I don't know.
This movie's crazy.

52:11.879 --> 52:16.016
Am I in your mind?
Are you in mine?

52:27.102 --> 52:29.102
I am never taking a plane,
boat, submarine, turtle,

52:29.229 --> 52:31.986
dragon, motorcycle, rocket,
parachute, train, hand car again.

52:32.149 --> 52:35.574
Yeah.
I mean, probably not.

52:40.741 --> 52:43.289
America.
It's good to be back!

52:43.452 --> 52:44.248
Okay.

52:44.411 --> 52:46.880
According to LT, the gem of the
sword is hidden in a mountain.

52:47.039 --> 52:52.294
Are there any mountains around here?
I never noticed that before.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.134
'Sup, boys.

52:54.296 --> 52:58.091
Stacy, I see two mountains right here.
Oh, crap.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.435
Not now.
Dude, we don't have time for this.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.187
Pssh, it can wait a little bit.

53:02.346 --> 53:04.690
The gem hasn't gone anywhere
for like a billion years.

53:04.848 --> 53:06.771
Pink's birthday party is
starting any minute.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.902
I got to get there.
No gem, no sword.

53:09.061 --> 53:11.689
No sword, no present.
No present, no Blue and Pink.

53:11.855 --> 53:14.358
Relax!
I'll just have a drink or two.

53:14.525 --> 53:18.700
You never just have a drink or two!
I promise, just a couple bottles.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.368
We'll have that whatever it is in no time.
Red!

53:21.532 --> 53:23.791
Seriously, what the hell?
We're so close!

53:23.951 --> 53:26.795
Don't be such a stick in the butt, dude!
We made it home!

53:26.954 --> 53:30.215
It's party time, man!
Hey, ladies!

53:30.374 --> 53:33.635
I don't know why I ever trusted you!
You never follow through on anything!

53:33.794 --> 53:36.801
This the most important thing that's
ever happened to me and you're bailing?

53:39.883 --> 53:43.102
Dude, there's boobs in here.
What am I supposed to do?

53:43.262 --> 53:46.224
Be my friend!
Sorry, bro.

53:46.390 --> 53:49.735
This train's leaving for
Waste-Face USA, population,

53:49.893 --> 53:52.737
des hoes, des nuts and
this bottle of Jack.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.777
Get over here girl!
Put your face on my sack!

53:54.940 --> 53:57.318
Woo!

53:57.484 --> 53:58.406
Red!

54:07.911 --> 54:12.876
Dude, this party sucks.
They've got free beer.

54:13.041 --> 54:17.717
Happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.052
Where's Blue?

54:26.847 --> 54:28.474
Jesus.

54:28.640 --> 54:32.978
That racoon's reward better be worth it.
I don't need that jerk.

54:33.145 --> 54:36.740
I can do this alone.
This is for you, Pink.

54:36.899 --> 54:40.615
I'm coming, baby.
Time to get my quest on.

54:40.778 --> 54:42.997
Begin at Big Montage!

55:46.134 --> 55:50.810
Hey, What's going on?
Oh, my god!

55:50.973 --> 55:52.099
What the hell?

56:07.489 --> 56:10.451
Oh, my god!
The chip is out!

56:10.617 --> 56:15.251
He thinks it's so cool!
Isn't this cool?

56:17.249 --> 56:19.422
Boss, that feels crazy.

56:23.088 --> 56:25.967
I suppose we should be
thankful, Blue Sun.

56:26.133 --> 56:29.763
You led us straight to the
Great Sword of Destiny.

56:29.928 --> 56:35.729
And now, I am going to avenge
every person who has died... ever!

56:35.893 --> 56:37.236
Wait.

56:37.394 --> 56:39.021
What about all those people
who died of old age?

56:39.187 --> 56:42.407
Them too!

56:42.566 --> 56:45.653
That's a stupid plan!
Now give me back that sword!

56:45.819 --> 56:46.991
Hmp.

56:47.154 --> 56:49.577
You're a stupid plan.

56:49.740 --> 56:51.868
Throw the round head
into the volcano!

57:01.835 --> 57:04.011
I curse life.
Red?

57:04.171 --> 57:05.718
What are you doing here?

57:05.881 --> 57:07.849
After I finished drinking all
those girls and screwing all

57:08.008 --> 57:11.512
that beer, I decided I should
come back for my friend.

57:11.678 --> 57:15.857
I must be dead.
Blue Sun, the red one tells the truth.

57:16.016 --> 57:19.941
You have a very good friend indeed.
You were right, man.

57:20.103 --> 57:23.819
For once, I got to finish what I started.
Plus, that sword is pretty tight.

57:23.982 --> 57:28.324
That's what I've been saying the whole time!
So, you're back?

57:28.487 --> 57:31.911
I'm back, dude.
You?

57:32.074 --> 57:33.200
You're back?

57:33.367 --> 57:37.747
It's is time to finish what
I started 10,000 years ago.

57:37.913 --> 57:42.255
Are you still butt hurt about that
little geisha you called a wife?

57:42.417 --> 57:46.797
The only one
who's about to be hurt is you.

57:46.964 --> 57:48.011
Ha ha ha ha ha.

57:48.173 --> 57:51.347
You really think you can
defeat all of us?

57:54.846 --> 57:58.146
And did you know I can go all night, baby?

57:58.308 --> 58:00.310
I'm nocturnal.

58:06.024 --> 58:08.785
We're in for a huge fight, aren't we?
You know it!

58:08.944 --> 58:09.865
Try to take some notes.

58:10.654 --> 58:11.746
Yeah, right.

58:11.905 --> 58:13.785
I didn't play all those video
games for nothing.

58:21.123 --> 58:24.885
New challenger appears...
K.O. Flawless victory!

58:25.043 --> 58:27.087
Finish him!
Oh, my god.

58:27.254 --> 58:29.051
This is actually working!
Yeah, dude!

58:29.214 --> 58:31.383
Keep doing it!
Hadouken!

58:31.550 --> 58:34.140
Brutality.
Animality.

58:34.302 --> 58:37.055
Bestiality!
Gross.

58:44.354 --> 58:46.277
You can't kill me!

58:46.440 --> 58:50.610
You're just a stupid raccoon!
You need better insults!

59:04.124 --> 59:06.509
Father Son.
Holy shit!

59:09.713 --> 59:14.785
If you ever want to fight evil,
you must keep your elbows straight.

59:15.052 --> 59:18.727
Father, one day
I want to go to America.

59:18.889 --> 59:22.860
That is not a country yet.

59:23.018 --> 59:25.646
You are Lord of Tachigami?

59:25.812 --> 59:29.616
Did you ever wonder why
we have the same last name?

59:29.775 --> 59:30.651
Impossible!

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:07.154
Father Sun, why
did you become so evil?

01:00:07.312 --> 01:00:11.237
I had to avenge all the people
who have died in the world.

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:16.704
But by killing people, aren't you
creating more people you need to avenge?

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:18.581
Yes.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.792
This way, I can do this
sweet job forever!

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.384
You are evil.

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:31.253
And you kept your elbows straight.

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:33.797
Siya-nara, Father Sun.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:47.402
Oh, shit.
Nature's ninja.

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:51.565
Raccoon, you okay?
I am so sad.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:55.945
But you did it, man!
You freakin' cut your dad's head off.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:02.535
It is true.
Tachigami is finally defeated.

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.453
Yeah, that hombre is muerte.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.212
What is that?

01:01:12.544 --> 01:01:14.012
Ocho Muerte.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:35.776
Follow me!

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:50.131
Ooh fuck!

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:53.213
Holy shit!
That's Ocho Muerte?

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:56.095
That is a big ass sushi!

01:01:56.254 --> 01:02:00.762
Boys, your town is in grave danger.
Oh, my god!

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.723
Pink!
She's probably fine.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:09.183
Okay.
We should probably get down there.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:11.064
Let's go!
Quickly!

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:13.071
There is no time to lose!

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:23.198
Hey. Pink!
Have you ever met my sister?

01:02:23.365 --> 01:02:26.372
Happy birthday.
Thanks.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:29.295
I just wish Blue was here.
Whatever, bitch.

01:02:29.454 --> 01:02:30.376
Boys are overrated.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.636
What the fuck is that?
Wow!

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:44.557
This party's crazy.
Oh, my boobs!

01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:59.196
Blue?
What's going on?

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:02.362
Sorry I'm late.
It's a long story.

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:06.204
Just like my dick!
Really, Red?

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:10.963
Ocho Muerte, go back from
whence you came.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:17.677
You can't kill the
Tachigami that easily!

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:22.307
Father Sun,
you are Ocho Muerte, too?

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:28.768
When you defeated me, I threw
up your wife for eternity!

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.481
A Tachigami could
never marry a geisha!

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:37.489
But Father Sun, I loved her!

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.490
Then how about a reunion?

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:47.249
Boys, it's up to you now.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.332
Oh, oh, no!
No!

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.217
No!
Papa Sun!

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.506
Blue, help!
Pink!

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:09.513
Dude, the sword!

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.606
Cartwheel, dude!

01:04:24.402 --> 01:04:25.574
Blue!

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:37.798
Blue!

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:39.459
No!

01:04:47.509 --> 01:04:50.011
D-du-dude!
It's slipping!

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:53.519
You can't pull me up with just one arm!
But I'll drop the sword!

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:57.957
Do it or you'll drop me!

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:01.239
Sorry, dude.
What?

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:02.320
No!

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.405
Red!

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:12.700
Did you just imagine dropping me?
Maybe.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:15.245
Fuck it.
Red!

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.922
Stop imaging ways to kill
me and pull me up!

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.257
Nah.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:29.893
I thought we were actually
friends this time.

01:05:35.515 --> 01:05:36.687
We are.

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:17.808
Holy shit.
Are you okay?

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:19.396
No way.
You?

01:06:19.559 --> 01:06:21.982
Nah.
Hey, man.

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:27.325
I'm sorry I've been such an asshole.
I've, never really had a friend before.

01:06:27.484 --> 01:06:29.197
Really?
Yeah.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.531
It's all good, man.
Just stop pooping in my bed, okay.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.287
I never pooped in your bed.
I've been pooping in my sleep?

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:39.086
Naw, I'm just messing with you.
I poop in your bed, but I won't anymore.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.502
Papa Sun?

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:48.467
Papa Sun!
Raccoon, that you?

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:51.928
Raccoon.

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:57.393
I'm alive.
Whoa.

01:06:57.555 --> 01:07:02.106
We thought you were super dead.
Seriously.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:06.109
Not yet.
Momma Sun?

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.407
Papa Sun.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:18.080
I thought I lost you forever.
No, my love.

01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:23.623
Only for 10,000 years.
I will never lose you again.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:27.802
That's your wife?
Yes.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:31.340
I could not face my son after
destroying Japan and I feared

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:33.429
the sword was lost forever.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:37.721
Thanks to your bravery, it has
been reconstructed and I could

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:41.562
now finally save my wife.
Wait.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.768
So this whole time we were actually
risking our necks for you?

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.687
We got tricked!

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:49.399
I did trick you into
finding the sword for me.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:53.196
But what you found for yourself
was friendship.

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:54.536
That's true.
Lame!

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:56.451
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.704
Pink.
Blue!

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:01.710
Pink!

01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:04.998
I was so worried about you.
I thought you were dead.

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:07.383
You know I'd never miss
your birthday party.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:11.297
Young lovers,
this sacred lotus flower has

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:14.432
kept our love strong
for 10,000 years.

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:18.390
May it do the same for you.

01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:21.557
Nintendo.

01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:25.526
Blue, it's beautiful.
I told you I'd get you something special.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:29.697
I love you.

01:08:30.814 --> 01:08:32.908
I love you too.
I got a boner!

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:34.363
Good one.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:35.573
Dude, aren't you glad
you went on this quest?

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.868
Yeah, man.
I told you I wasn't pussy.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.078
Pssh.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.783
I always knew we could pull it off.
Really?

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:45.205
Well yeah, cuz we're awesome!

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.214
Oh my fucking god!

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:50.216
That shit was totally amazing!

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:53.801
Your brain can not
even comprehend.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:56.807
So much hand shooting excitement.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.810
For the sake of your couch, I
hope you're wearing Depends.

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:03.143
We learned so many things together.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:06.776
Japan is weird and French
people slime.

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:12.490
This film had 10 scenes of action and
everyone together said fuck 21 times.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.736
Yeah!
Dick Figures!

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:20.703
You just watched a whole fucking
movie of Dick Figures!

01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:22.332
Dick Figures!

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:25.712
Bow before them and renounce
your creepiest god.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:28.292
Dick Figures!

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:32.050
Someone get a doctor because this
movie's fucking totally sick!

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.633
You asked them, they delivered!

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:38.633
If you don't like Dick Figures it's
not hard to figure out you're a dick.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.020
I counted 10 fucking
explosions and jet-packed

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:45.227
demon ninjas that rocked your face.

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:47.609
Your life was a hot
pile of garbage.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:51.191
Now you're so excited that you're
nutting all over the place!

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:54.198
One of those explosions
was an octopus.

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:57.577
Sorry for the spoiler,
but it's your fault.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:10:01.872
That'll teach you to listen to the sound
track before you watch the movie.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.913
I mean, for god's sake who does that?
You stupid piece of...

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:07.545
Dick Figures!
Dick Figures!

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:11.504
Saved the world, what do you
think about Dick Figures!

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:14.794
Dick Figures!
You just watched it.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:19.428
You're lazy and fat.
Dick Figures!

01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:24.053
You love them with all of your stupid
heart and also part of your junk.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.063
You asked them, they delivered.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:29.442
A movie so great it made
your junk explode.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.399
Whoops.
Our bad.

01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:36.408
Sorry about your junk.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:41.366
Just kidding!
Fuck you!

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:42.451
Dick Figures.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.806
That shit was crazy!
Yeah.
