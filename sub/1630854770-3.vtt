Everett, your friend Connor

We have local PD out

15:52.650 --> 15:54.250
But it does make me wonder.

might not want to be found?

they set the fire.

- So how come every word
out of their mouths

23:05.580 --> 23:07.380

23:07.580 --> 23:09.180

they're teenagers.

23:09.380 --> 23:10.550
All they do is lie.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.920
Second, they probably
are hiding something.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.520

to do with the fire.

have pushed harder.

that's all they kill.
