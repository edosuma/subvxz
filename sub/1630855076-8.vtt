So, this is where
the magic happens.

00:03.212 --> 00:05.297
By which I mean sudoku.

00:05.297 --> 00:06.340
(both laugh)

00:06.340 --> 00:08.258
Oh, wow.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.302
-That's a lot of love seats.
-Yeah.

00:10.302 --> 00:13.138
I think you can never have
too many love seats, so...

00:13.138 --> 00:15.098
-I hope not.
-(chuckles)

00:15.098 --> 00:16.391
I've just been getting
the house together,

00:16.391 --> 00:19.269
buying furniture,
uh, making art.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.355
Actually, I've been getting
into this movement

00:21.355 --> 00:22.689
called "freebuilding."

00:22.689 --> 00:24.733
It's, uh, making sculptures
out of leftover

00:24.733 --> 00:26.985
construction material.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.738
-So I just kind of let my hands
tell me where to hammer.
-Mm.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.448
So you just let your hands go

00:31.448 --> 00:33.242
wherever the hell you want,
don't you?

00:33.242 --> 00:35.410
Yep. And so, how about--
this is a pretty cool color,

00:35.410 --> 00:36.370
don't you think?

00:36.370 --> 00:37.538
Mm.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.747
Someone left a can
of Benjamin Moore

00:38.747 --> 00:39.790
at my site in Woburn.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.792
They did?
That's so silly of them.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.502
Super high quality.

00:43.502 --> 00:46.421
Very popular shade.
October Mist, it's called.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.048
-Moody.
-Yeah.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.633
It's a green that makes
everything look better.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.134
Like your eyes.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.011
-Oh, thank you.
-(chuckles)

00:53.011 --> 00:56.265
And this piece, wow.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.600
You know, it's, like,
very masculine,

00:58.600 --> 01:00.102
but then... (exhales sharply)

01:00.102 --> 01:01.436
like, all of a sudden
very feminine.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.896
It's sensual, this...

01:02.896 --> 01:04.690
-It's my mom.
-Oh.

01:04.690 --> 01:07.776
(mutters) So, I sculpted it
based on the memory

01:07.776 --> 01:09.570
of her taking care
of my grandma

01:09.570 --> 01:10.988

-Careful with the patient.

for two days.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.171
It's fine. I'm fine.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.672

-You made it.

-Wow. Wow!

05:06.640 --> 05:09.142
Yep, did the happy part.

Nothing. Cool party.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.229

-Yeah.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.980

-I will turn this baby shower
into a meeting

what's going on.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.788

05:31.998 --> 05:33.917

05:33.917 --> 05:35.794
No, no, I didn't drink.

But you came close, right?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.005
Well...

05:39.005 --> 05:41.508
Okay, what's happening
with finding a new sponsor?

05:41.508 --> 05:42.926
Who have you called?

05:42.926 --> 05:44.135
Um...

05:44.135 --> 05:46.596
-Sam...
-No, no, I--

05:46.596 --> 05:48.056
-I just, I've been really busy.
-Uh-huh.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.183
Seriously, like, they gave me
a lot more responsibility

05:50.183 --> 05:52.310
-at Hit Pause.
I cover Revere now.
-Mm.

05:52.310 --> 05:56.231
And Needham and Dedham
and Spreadham.

05:56.231 --> 05:59.985
Okay, I'm going to introduce you
to the best person I know.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.319
My sponsor.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.697
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.157
Let's go meet Darby.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.076
Okay, so she's technically
your grand sponsor,

06:08.076 --> 06:09.286
but do not call her that.

06:09.286 --> 06:10.537
-She thinks that it ages her.
-Okay.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.497
Oh, interesting.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.667
So this one actually
smells like a diaper.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.960
I wonder what they put
in the chocolate.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.670
Is that her?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.422
Yeah. Is there a problem?

06:20.422 --> 06:23.675
No. She seems... cool.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.886
Is she eating poop
out of a diaper?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.178
Oh, yeah.
She's totally insane.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.058
ALL:
Aw...

06:32.058 --> 06:33.435
WOMAN:
Look how cute.

MINDY:
Right, this onesie's
from Sandra.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.439
And since it's my
future godchild's special day,

06:37.439 --> 06:38.815
we won't be discussing
my thoughts

06:38.815 --> 06:40.901
on woke capitalism.
Thanks, Sandra.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.235
SANDRA:
Thank you.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.987
(gasps)

06:46.072 --> 06:47.991
-(laughs)
-Darby, no!

06:47.991 --> 06:50.535
Yes! Oh, my God, can you believe
they still sell giant panties

06:50.535 --> 06:52.245
-at the place by Dollywood?
-No.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.582
Okay, after our
freshman year at Smith,

06:55.582 --> 06:57.542
we went on this little road trip
together to see the country.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.294
It was more about doing
every drug imaginable

06:59.294 --> 07:02.172
in gross motels than seeing
the country, but whatever.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.632
So we're driving down 95,
and I saw what I thought

07:03.632 --> 07:05.091
was a floating dog.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.677
And I'm like, "Uh-oh, she's on
dorm room peyote."

07:07.677 --> 07:09.095
And she gets out
to pet the dog.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.597
-OLIVIA: Yeah.
-And it turns out

07:10.597 --> 07:13.433
it's just the sign for this
random underwear store.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.435
Yeah, so there's this,
like, really angry dude...

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
I know, but remember he had
the Jodie Foster tattoo?

07:17.437 --> 07:19.356
-So we-- I felt
like we were safe.
-Yeah.

07:19.356 --> 07:22.442
He loved us so much, he gave us
each a pair of panties

07:22.442 --> 07:24.861
-with a rottweiler on it.
-(laughter)

07:24.861 --> 07:27.697
Oversized canine panties
from Darby.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.865
Not sure how the baby
will wear them,

07:28.865 --> 07:29.908
but that's funny.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.493
It can be used as a swaddle.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.328
-It's a swaddle.
-Yes.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.454
That's the last gift,
everyone.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.830
-Thank you all for coming.
-(applause)

07:35.830 --> 07:39.292
OLIVIA:
Thank you, I have missed
you all so much.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.420
So, Olivia tells me we're going
to be working together.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.548
Oh, yeah, I-I guess we are.
I'm Sam.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.758
-Yeah. I'm Darby.
-Right.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.301
I was conceived in an Arby's

07:48.301 --> 07:50.178
with the help of a man
named Dan.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.680
My mother loved wordplay.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.265
Funnily enough,
she's also an alcoholic.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.684
I think my mom
just picked my name

07:55.684 --> 07:57.560
out of a book of Jewish
girl names,

07:57.560 --> 07:59.396
so it's not as interesting.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.564
-True story.
-Sorry, what?

08:01.564 --> 08:02.857
Your story's not as interesting.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.735
-You guys are connecting.
Hi.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.696
Did Darby tell you
she has 20 years sober?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.322
I have 20 years sober.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.199
I loved rum and cocaine.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.660
If you want, you can check out
my dissolved septum.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.661
You can put your fingertips
through it.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.162
I don't need to do that.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.247
It's essentially like
a razor-thin slice of ginger

08:17.247 --> 08:18.915
at a fancy sushi restaurant.
Try it.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.959
-Isn't that crazy?
-It's so gross.
-It's very gross.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.753
-OLIVIA: I love that.
-Very cool.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.463
Okay, so, a little bit more
about me.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.465
The program saved my life
at age 20.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.551
I've never even had
a legal drink.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.927
And then Darby saved my life.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.929
She got me out of a bottle
and into a meeting.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.347
Great.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.641
I love this.
Keep going.

08:36.641 --> 08:38.476
Sam, tell her your story.

08:38.476 --> 08:39.519
What, right now?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.688
-Just do it.
-Okay.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.940
-Well, I got sober about...
-Where's your gift?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.400
'Cause I didn't see Mindy
write anything down.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.110
I didn't-- I didn't bring one.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.069
-Huh.
-'Cause, you know, the baby's

08:48.069 --> 08:49.654
not even born yet.
And it's like,

08:49.654 --> 08:51.656
how can you get a gift
for someone you don't know?

08:51.656 --> 08:53.408
Well, you just go to a store
and you buy a gift.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.535
And then if you feel weird about
it, you can get a gift receipt

08:55.535 --> 08:56.911
or you can switch the tags
on the present table.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.289
Sometimes I do that.
Cute jammies.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.666
-Yeah, thanks.
-Do you want to go shopping?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.544
-Now? Uh...
-Yeah.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.337
So, how do you like
your sessions?

09:06.337 --> 09:08.423
You like a little chitchat?

09:08.423 --> 09:09.632
Do you want to talk
about the new season

09:09.632 --> 09:11.009
of The Real Housewives
of Atlanta?

09:11.009 --> 09:12.052
I don't know that show.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.219
You know what,

09:13.219 --> 09:14.554
it's too much
to catch you up on.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.014
But, uh, we can do this thing
where you tell me

09:16.014 --> 09:17.474
all your problems
and I don't say anything,

09:17.474 --> 09:19.017
and that's called "hair-apy."

09:19.017 --> 09:20.810
I'll take quiet. Thank you.

09:20.810 --> 09:21.895
Got it.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.774
-How's Samantha?
-Huh?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.567
Samantha. How is she?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.527
Is she still... at Brit's?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.613
Is she with the boyfriend?

09:31.613 --> 09:33.740
Got it. All right.
That's why you came to see me.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.910
Sam is...

09:36.910 --> 09:38.578
First of all, she's safe.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.121
She is still employed.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.748
And she seems pretty happy.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.083
She's happy?

09:43.083 --> 09:44.751
In what ways is she happy?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.461
Maybe you should call her
for more information.

09:46.461 --> 09:49.214
I don't think she will pick up.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.968
I'm going to Friends
and Family meetings.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.470
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.554
Yeah.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.098
I'm gonna fix whatever it is

09:58.098 --> 09:59.849
everyone thinks is wrong
with me. (chuckles softly)

09:59.849 --> 10:01.601
I don't know

10:01.601 --> 10:04.687
how to repair things
with Samantha.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.815
For example,

10:06.815 --> 10:09.692
it appears it was a mistake
to read her Fourth Step.

10:09.692 --> 10:10.819
Did you know about that?

10:10.819 --> 10:11.820
The diary thing?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.321
Technically, no.

10:13.321 --> 10:17.033
It is a list of your resentments
that you write out

10:17.033 --> 10:18.910
so you can let them go.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.328
Sounds like you really know
what's up.

10:20.328 --> 10:21.871
I do now.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.999
I don't...

10:24.999 --> 10:29.003
think she's going
to let me make that right.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.547
What do you think that'll take?

10:30.547 --> 10:33.424
One of us has to apologize.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.968
I...

10:34.968 --> 10:36.511
guess that's me.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.848
Do you agree with that though?

10:39.848 --> 10:41.808
Because it really is
a two-way street.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.561
Listen, Carol, you screwed up.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.979
It was your fault, you know?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.730
And sometimes, as a mom,

10:47.730 --> 10:50.066
you just got to learn
to take the "L."

10:50.066 --> 10:51.526
What's the "L"?

10:51.526 --> 10:53.111
The loss.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.237
(inhales sharply)

10:55.822 --> 10:57.991
And that's enough haircut
for today.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.034
Oh.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.953
I didn't do the...

11:01.953 --> 11:03.788
-You got my cape on!
-(door opens)

11:03.788 --> 11:04.706
(door slams)

11:05.790 --> 11:07.959
♪ ♪

11:11.254 --> 11:13.381
And these are made from ostrich.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.842
Oh. Do you know
how the ostrich was raised?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.135
I assume like any other ostrich.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.052
That's not good enough.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.679
That could mean anything.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.681
I kind of, uh, thought

11:21.681 --> 11:23.850
this would be more of,
like, a mall situation.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.144
What the hell are you gonna buy
a baby at the mall? (scoffs)

11:26.144 --> 11:28.062
(chuckles)
Right. Yeah. Silly me.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.105
No, don't get me wrong.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.899
I have nothing against malls.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.192
I love anywhere people shop.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.444
It's just older stuff
has better energy.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.029
There's life in it.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.198
When I buy something
wrapped in plastic, it's like,

11:38.198 --> 11:40.158
-"Do you want
to put a gun to my head?"
-No.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.451
But you get it.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.619
Right?

11:42.619 --> 11:45.413
Like, this is a liminal space.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.207
It's... sacred.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.374
It's transformational.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.709
It's...

11:49.709 --> 11:52.212
mm, shamanistic.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.677
(humming)

11:59.677 --> 12:00.678
(grunts)

12:01.888 --> 12:04.098
So, let's talk
about your sobriety.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.266
Here?

12:05.266 --> 12:06.768
Yeah. No one's listening.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.312
The flow of people here,
it's like a river.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.564
We're just two little frogs
basking on the bank.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.608
I'd really rather do this
where there aren't

12:13.608 --> 12:15.068
Dust Bowl baby dolls
staring at me.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.569
Do you want my help or not?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.404
Look, it's just a story.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.447
It's probably not even
that good.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.532
-I mean, it's not not good.
-Look,

12:21.532 --> 12:24.994
I am going to need you to
tell me something interesting.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.829
That's why I got into this game.
I mean, if you're just

12:26.829 --> 12:29.207
a boring person,
we might not be a match.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.458
-I'm not a boring person.
-Okay.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.376
-I'm not.
-Great.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.543
All right, fine.

12:32.543 --> 12:35.797
Get this-- I just ditched
a 24/7 funeral

12:35.797 --> 12:37.507
so I could try to bang my ex,

12:37.507 --> 12:39.300
who has less than a year sober.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.677
And he turned me down anyway.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.053
And then, when that didn't work,

12:42.053 --> 12:44.639
I took a 40-minute Uber
to my other ex,

12:44.639 --> 12:47.308
who is currently going through
a divorce with my best friend.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.270
Yeah. And I'm living on
her couch right now. For free.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.188
'Cause I had to move out
of my mom's house, 'cause she's

12:52.188 --> 12:53.690
a crazy person.
And I have a boyfriend

12:53.690 --> 12:55.525
who's none of the people
that I just mentioned.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.651
And we're in a fight.

12:56.651 --> 12:57.735
So...

12:57.735 --> 12:59.320
(mimics explosion)

12:59.320 --> 13:01.572
-Yikes.
-What should I do?

13:01.572 --> 13:02.699
I don't know.
What do you think you should do?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.033
-I don't know.
-I don't either.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.868
-It's confusing.
-Isn't this your job?

13:05.868 --> 13:07.370
I think it's your job, actually.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.663
What do you want to do?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.581
I don't know.
Do you think I should, like,

13:10.581 --> 13:12.500
tell my boyfriend
about everything that I did?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.502
If I knew, I would tell you.
But I'm not Brené Brown.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.296
-Well, should I tell my friend?
-Why?

13:16.296 --> 13:18.339
Because you're afraid that
she'll kick you off her sofa?

13:18.339 --> 13:20.300
-Okay, so I shouldn't tell her.
-Well, I'm not saying that.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.427
I mean, would you rather
that your friend hear it

13:22.427 --> 13:23.636
-from the guy?
-Okay, so I should tell her?

13:23.636 --> 13:25.930
Honey, I don't know.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.474
I'm literally just, like,
looking at boots. (gasps)

13:28.474 --> 13:30.685
Oh, my God, Sam.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.103
-A bag of spells.
-Mm!

13:32.103 --> 13:33.563
Babies love that shit.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.689
-Oh, wow.
-Such a good gift.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.732
Yeah.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.942
Wait, what?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.527
SAMANTHA:
Nothing-nothing happened.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.154
He was classic Joel
about all of it.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.488
But I did go there to try

13:42.488 --> 13:44.240
to make something happen,
if that makes sense.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.534
No. It doesn't make sense.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.452
You tried to hook up with Joel,

13:47.452 --> 13:49.162
but you didn't,

13:49.162 --> 13:51.122
so, ultimately,
nothing happened?

13:51.122 --> 13:52.206
Why are you telling me this?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.207
It sucks that I know this.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.208
Well, I just thought that...

13:54.208 --> 13:56.377
And why would you tell me
at work?

13:56.377 --> 13:57.920
I just pulled a Tic Tac out
of a kid's ear.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.380
This is my break!

13:59.380 --> 14:00.798
Don't you have,
like, eight journals?

14:00.798 --> 14:02.759
Why don't you just write
in one of those next time?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.302
-That's a good idea, actually.
-And you know what?

14:04.302 --> 14:05.678
I wish you had hooked up
with Joel,

14:05.678 --> 14:08.389
because then I could feel good
about feeling mad.

You know, I think
what might have happened is that

14:47.011 --> 14:49.013
you came to me, a human,

14:49.013 --> 14:50.890
instead of consulting
your higher power.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.517

No one.
I don't have a higher power.

Well, no. I mean,
you've been in the program

-E-Everybody's got something.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.657
Yeah, well, not me. Sorry.

No, you have... something, Sam.

My dad, okay? I...

15:16.249 --> 15:18.876

would tell me to do, I guess.

Oh.

Well, again, human, so...

15:27.385 --> 15:29.220
-Your higher power is shopping.
-No.

15:29.220 --> 15:30.805
That's not what
my higher power is.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.473
But that's not what
we're talking about.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.558
Sam,

15:33.558 --> 15:34.934
-humans...
-(sighs)

15:34.934 --> 15:37.395
...people will inevitably
always let you down.

Yeah, well, uh, thanks, Darby.

Oh. Okay.

Oh, yeah.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.223

all that incense

my voice is so deep.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.060
I guess I have to give that one
to Darby then.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.312
But?

16:19.312 --> 16:20.938
But I'm-I'm sorry,

16:20.938 --> 16:22.648
but what do you see in her?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.734
I mean, if she is the sponsor
to end all sponsors,

16:24.734 --> 16:27.153
why does she kind of... suck?

16:27.153 --> 16:28.696
Do you think she kind of sucks
because she doesn't tell you

16:28.696 --> 16:30.865
-what you want to hear?
-No, she doesn't tell me
anything.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.909
At least with you, it was,
you know, "Don't drink.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.410
I know you want to drink.
Don't drink."

16:34.410 --> 16:36.120
With Darby, all I get is,

16:36.120 --> 16:38.122
"I don't know, Sam.
What do you think you should do?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.665
"Oh, yeah,
that's pretty confusing.

16:39.665 --> 16:40.708
What do you want to do?"

16:40.708 --> 16:42.376
Sam, you have two years

16:42.376 --> 16:44.879
-and Darby has... 20.
-(sighs)

16:44.879 --> 16:46.297
You can trust her.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.090
But don't you think
she's, like...

16:48.090 --> 16:49.342
(groans)

16:49.342 --> 16:50.968
You know? Does she care at all?

16:50.968 --> 16:53.429
-(scoffs)
-No. Darby doesn't care
about your feelings,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.556
because alcohol doesn't care
about your feelings.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.769
I...

16:59.769 --> 17:03.648
I think I just really wanted to
need all of this a little less.

17:03.648 --> 17:04.732
You know?

17:04.732 --> 17:06.025
Feel normal or something.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.903
Normal isn't for people like us.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.198
Sam, you're a drunk.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.574
I'm a drunk.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.992
Everyone's a drunk drunk.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.077
(chuckles softly)

17:16.077 --> 17:17.662
And we all need something

17:17.662 --> 17:19.413
bigger than we are
to get through this.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.624

17:27.213 --> 17:28.172

17:29.966 --> 17:32.009

17:48.484 --> 17:49.986
Um...

17:49.986 --> 17:51.862
I want to talk to you.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.614
We have unfinished business.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.907
Yeah.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.450
I know you think
I probably overstepped

17:56.450 --> 17:57.743
and you're not thrilled with me,

-I mean,

18:02.039 --> 18:04.375
Sam and I weren't
the easiest kids to deal with,

18:04.375 --> 18:06.002
and you've never been
my biggest cheerleader.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.546
I don't... cheer.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.298
Right.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.925
I guess I just always thought
you blamed me for Sam.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.302
I blamed you

18:14.302 --> 18:15.595
for the getting home late

18:15.595 --> 18:17.138
and the drinking.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.640
But my daughter's an alcoholic,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.809
and I know that now.

18:21.809 --> 18:22.685
So I blame her.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.688
No, I don't.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.106
No. Mm.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.232
I don't blame her,

18:28.232 --> 18:29.650
because that's blame shifting.

18:29.650 --> 18:33.446
Um, can I blame the disease?

18:33.446 --> 18:35.239
Mm, uh, can you?

18:35.239 --> 18:36.532
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.618
Doesn't matter.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.079
I didn't like you when you were
a shitty little teen, Felicia.

18:42.079 --> 18:45.291
But I respect the hell out
of you as a mother.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.043
Thank you.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.836
It's the hardest job
in the world.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.297
Yeah, Zack almost killed me when
he was the last in his class

18:51.297 --> 18:52.423
to be potty-trained.

18:52.423 --> 18:53.841
(chuckles)

18:53.841 --> 18:56.302
And you did it all on your own.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.262
-Pretty much. Yeah.
-Mm.

18:58.262 --> 19:00.848
Yeah, I know...

19:00.848 --> 19:03.100
something of what that's like.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.354
David went away for a while
when Sam was a baby.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.022
-Oh, I didn't know that.
-Yeah.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.273
He went to New York

19:09.273 --> 19:11.108
and he played
with the Philharmonic

19:11.108 --> 19:14.403
and, um,
was gone for months and...

19:15.738 --> 19:18.908
I was not a great single mom.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.535
I couldn't figure out naps

19:21.535 --> 19:24.163
and the bottles.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165
And I yelled at her.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.335
I once left Sam in a cart

19:29.335 --> 19:31.337
at the Stop & Shop.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.381
I just left her.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.133
And the manager had to chase me
out into the parking lot.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.302
This is something
you would never do.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.638
I actually did that
at a CVS once.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.473
You're a great mom.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.517
We listen
to way too much true crime

19:44.517 --> 19:48.020
for you to not answer
a single one of my... texts.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.819
Do you want to go have dinner?

19:57.488 --> 19:58.864

20:04.245 --> 20:05.871
Oh, hey-- Oh.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.790
-Damn it,
you are not my sandwich.
-Hey, so I have

20:07.790 --> 20:09.375
been beating myself up all day,

20:09.375 --> 20:10.751
-and I was like,
"You know what..."
-Joel.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.336
-Joel.
-No, I-I have to do this. Um...

20:12.336 --> 20:14.672
A thing happened with Sam.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.173
Here's the thing though--
it also didn't happen,

20:16.173 --> 20:17.425
-which was...
-Yeah.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.802
I know.
I've already heard this today.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.929
-You have?
-Yeah. Sam told me.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.930
Sorry,
why do you both feel the need

20:22.930 --> 20:24.014
to come here to tell me things?

20:24.014 --> 20:26.183
I don't know. I-- It...

20:26.183 --> 20:27.768
It feels kind of like
I'm supposed to?

20:27.768 --> 20:29.520
We're divorced. We can move on.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.105
Go. Fly.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.815
Okay.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.775
You know, the thing is though

20:34.775 --> 20:36.652
you still haven't even signed
the divorce papers.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.195
I'm fine to move on.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.697
Just let me know
when you want to do it.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.073
If you even do.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.702
Sorry I wasn't your sandwich,
by the way.
