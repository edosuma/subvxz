01:41.867 --> 01:44.103
Hey, Jamie.

01:44.136 --> 01:46.839
<i>Hi, Chris.
How you doing with all this wind?</i>

01:47.940 --> 01:50.508
House is still standing.

01:50.542 --> 01:53.045
<i>Yeah, we had a lot of thunder
and lightning over here.</i>

01:53.078 --> 01:54.780
<i>Of course, Willow loved it.</i>

01:55.781 --> 01:57.850
Yeah, she's fearless, that kid.

02:00.385 --> 02:02.888
Well, the reason I'm calling...

02:02.922 --> 02:05.557
I still haven't signed the
divorce and alimony papers yet.

02:07.159 --> 02:08.860
<i>Any particular reason?</i>

02:11.496 --> 02:12.731
Uh...

02:15.901 --> 02:18.070
I guess it just feels so, um...

02:18.971 --> 02:20.940
so final.

02:20.973 --> 02:23.976
<i>Well, it is final.</i>

02:26.812 --> 02:29.114
I should have fought harder
to keep us together, Jamie.

02:29.148 --> 02:34.753
- <i>But you didn't. The company came first.</i>
- I sold the company.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.621
<i>That wasn't for us.</i>

02:36.654 --> 02:38.958
<i>You did that for the money,
and you know it.</i>

02:38.991 --> 02:41.827
Right. Punishment time.

02:44.562 --> 02:48.100
<i>I'm moving on, Chris,
and you need to do the same.</i>

02:51.904 --> 02:53.605
Tell Kendall I'll get it done.

02:53.638 --> 02:54.974
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:02.815 --> 03:04.083
I miss Daddy.

03:05.851 --> 03:09.420
I know, baby. I miss him, too.

03:11.156 --> 03:13.759
Why don't you love him anymore?

03:13.792 --> 03:17.096
I do. Of course I do.

03:17.129 --> 03:20.498
You know,
sometimes when you are...

03:20.531 --> 03:24.937
not with somebody, doesn't mean
you stop loving them.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.873
And anyway, we both love you
very, very much.

03:27.907 --> 03:29.208
You know that, right?

03:29.241 --> 03:31.676
Okay, sweet pea.

03:32.845 --> 03:34.412
Mwah.

04:55.227 --> 04:56.494
Hey!

05:00.565 --> 05:01.845
Do you know anything about wine?

05:04.069 --> 05:05.804
A little.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.306
I'm helpless here.

05:07.339 --> 05:09.574
I could really use
a recommendation.

05:10.608 --> 05:11.810
Any special occasion?

05:11.844 --> 05:14.645
Yeah, I had
an amazingly shitty day.

05:14.679 --> 05:18.649
Ah, so basically you're looking for
a bottle to kill before you pass out.

05:18.683 --> 05:20.585
You read my mind.

05:20.618 --> 05:23.989
Well, you can't go wrong with
a Nebbiolo. And here it is.

05:27.726 --> 05:28.894
Yeah.

05:32.231 --> 05:35.801
Oh, wow.
Thanks, you're a lifesaver.

05:35.834 --> 05:36.935
I'm Chris.

05:38.603 --> 05:39.738
Sky.

05:48.380 --> 05:50.249
Oh, shit!

05:52.217 --> 05:56.587
- You okay?
- My Uber just canceled.

05:56.621 --> 05:58.824
I'm parked right over there.
You want a ride?

06:13.939 --> 06:16.341
I thought she'd be
passed out by now.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.143
Who?

06:18.177 --> 06:21.612
My roommate, Loony Lisa.

06:22.815 --> 06:26.318
We had a big fight, so I left.

06:26.351 --> 06:28.720
I really don't want to
get back into it,

06:28.754 --> 06:32.291
because she can
get kind of crazy.

06:32.324 --> 06:34.659
I don't live far from here.

06:34.692 --> 06:36.371
You can come over to mine.
We can hang out.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.231
I can drop you back off
when she goes to sleep.

06:39.264 --> 06:41.900
It's okay. Thanks.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.602
Better go in
and get this over with.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.276
Bye.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.986
No, I have no
fucking clue where she went!

07:11.930 --> 07:13.631
Offer still stands.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.025
It's dark out here.

07:42.461 --> 07:43.829
You afraid of the dark?

07:44.496 --> 07:45.831
No.

07:47.065 --> 07:48.834
I love the dark.

07:59.811 --> 08:02.447
House sitting for your parents?

08:02.481 --> 08:04.082
No. It's mine.

08:12.024 --> 08:13.959
You're like a hermit up here.

08:13.992 --> 08:17.763
Uh, kind of, yeah.
But that's the way I like it.

08:25.070 --> 08:26.405
Should I let it breathe?

08:27.372 --> 08:28.907
I say pour it.

08:36.381 --> 08:37.716
Thank you.

08:43.989 --> 08:45.490
To...

08:47.292 --> 08:49.361
sudden adventures.

08:49.394 --> 08:51.363
To sudden adventures.

08:56.535 --> 08:57.803
Mmm.

08:58.904 --> 09:00.138
What's the verdict?

09:10.349 --> 09:12.384
- It's tasty.
- Mm.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.021
Thank you.

09:19.825 --> 09:22.995
So, Chris, what do you
do for a living?

09:24.096 --> 09:28.133
Uh, I'm sort of
retired, actually.

09:28.166 --> 09:32.271
You're a little
young for that, aren't you?

09:32.304 --> 09:35.407
Junior year at MIT,
I inherited some money.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.177
I got into mobile apps, games,
banking, order tracking.

09:41.046 --> 09:45.250
Uh, GPS
and location-based services.

09:45.284 --> 09:47.919
But the breakout was this guy.

09:47.953 --> 09:50.055
Watch Dog Home Security app.

09:50.088 --> 09:54.359
Google Play made me an offer I
couldn't refuse, and now here I am,

09:54.393 --> 09:56.828
trying to figure out what to do
with the rest of my life.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.997
How about you?

09:59.031 --> 10:03.835
I modeled in LA for a couple
of years, print and runway.

10:03.869 --> 10:06.238
But I hated just being
a body in clothes.

10:06.271 --> 10:09.141
A plastic manikin.

10:09.174 --> 10:13.011
So I came here on an assignment.
Decided to stay,

10:13.045 --> 10:16.381
hang around and see if I couldn't
find something more fulfilling.

10:16.415 --> 10:19.351
- Did you?
- No.

10:19.384 --> 10:24.089
That's why I work as one of those cocktail
waitresses at the Kitty Warren bar.

10:25.223 --> 10:26.224
Huh.

10:28.026 --> 10:30.529
Do you always do your
grocery shopping after midnight?

10:30.562 --> 10:34.132
Mm-hmm. Pretty much, yeah.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.367
You don't like people?

10:38.937 --> 10:41.073
Every so often
I meet one I like.

10:52.918 --> 10:55.053
I think I should've gotten us
a second bottle.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.289
Ah. Well...

10:59.124 --> 11:02.627
- Let me show you something.
- Okay.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.229
I'm not just a tech nerd...

11:05.364 --> 11:07.966
- I'm also a wine nerd.
- Wow!

11:07.999 --> 11:09.301
What do you like?

11:09.334 --> 11:13.372
Hm. Something rare,
extremely expensive.

11:30.155 --> 11:32.124
You kind of saved me tonight.

11:33.191 --> 11:36.628
Oh, yeah? From, uh...

11:36.661 --> 11:38.497
Loony Lisa?

11:38.530 --> 11:40.132
Yeah.

11:42.167 --> 11:45.270
Never move in
with a total stranger, right?

11:49.742 --> 11:51.610
Shit! What time is it?

11:52.577 --> 11:56.148
Uh, it's just after 2:15.

11:56.181 --> 11:58.550
You should probably
run me back home.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.920
Hopefully, Lisa's zonked out
in an opiate coma by now.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.924
You sure you
want to go back there?

12:07.492 --> 12:09.428
No.

12:09.461 --> 12:10.529
But...

12:11.997 --> 12:13.965
what's the alternative?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.172
You could stay.

13:14.292 --> 13:15.527
Ah...

14:21.526 --> 14:24.596
Walk of shame.

14:27.532 --> 14:32.170
Shame. Shame.
Shame. Shame. Shame.

14:36.241 --> 14:39.712
- I waited up all fucking night.
- I told you not to.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.180
No call? No text?
Where were you?

14:42.213 --> 14:46.184
- Were you in my room again?
- This is my place! You're a fucking guest here!

14:46.217 --> 14:48.629
You know, maybe you should go, right?
Like, pack your shit and go?

14:48.653 --> 14:51.189
- Lisa, let's talk about this later, okay?
- Right? Yeah.

14:51.222 --> 14:52.667
What, you were
just gonna fucking call it?

14:52.691 --> 14:54.626
Yeah? You're gonna
get your shit and go?

14:54.659 --> 14:59.297
Fuck! Please, Sky! No, no, no, no.
I didn't mean it.

15:00.833 --> 15:03.803
No, please, Lisa,
stay as long as you like.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.772
Please, just open the fucking door.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.429
<i>All right. All right, honey.</i>

15:31.463 --> 15:35.701
<i>Time to go to bed.
Turn off the light.</i>

15:35.735 --> 15:38.704
<i>- Daddy?
- Hmm?</i>

15:38.738 --> 15:41.741
<i>Remember when we were
at the park and I got lost?</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:46.244
<i>- Yeah.
- I was so worried that I was never going to see you again.</i>

15:46.277 --> 15:50.950
<i>And then you found me, and you promised
that you'd never leave me alone.</i>

15:50.983 --> 15:54.252
<i>- Remember, Daddy?
- Yeah, of course, baby.</i>

16:20.612 --> 16:22.614
Hi.

16:22.647 --> 16:26.284
You didn't leave any contact
information at my place.

16:26.317 --> 16:29.254
And I figured showing up
at your apartment,

16:29.287 --> 16:31.399
knocking on your front door
would have been a little, uh...

16:31.423 --> 16:32.725
Stalker-like?

16:33.759 --> 16:34.960
Yeah.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.763
And showing up
at my place of work isn't?

16:39.330 --> 16:41.366
- And yet...
- What?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.770
Well, you didn't exactly seem

16:44.804 --> 16:48.841
surprised or disappointed
to see me.

16:48.874 --> 16:52.277
Okay. Guess I was
hoping a little.

16:56.614 --> 16:59.451
You know, don't get too excited.

16:59.484 --> 17:02.520
I'm only here 'cause my ex-wife
told me to move on with my life.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.929
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.330
It's okay. It's just...

17:14.967 --> 17:16.434
What?

17:16.468 --> 17:17.837
Nothing.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.480
I'm glad you wanted to see me.

17:28.512 --> 17:31.683
But... I've got
an admission to make.

17:33.518 --> 17:35.653
Chris, I'm what they call...

17:36.588 --> 17:38.924
damaged goods.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.960
What are you talking about?
You're great.

17:42.627 --> 17:44.529
Back in the restaurant,

17:44.562 --> 17:47.565
I lied to you about my family.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.936
What, the whole Gypsy thing?

17:52.772 --> 17:56.809
Truth is I don't have a family.

17:56.842 --> 17:59.477
I never had a family.

17:59.511 --> 18:01.947
It was always just me.

18:01.981 --> 18:05.017
From the age of six,
I was in and out of foster homes.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.086
So many, I can't even remember.

18:07.119 --> 18:12.323
And believe me, I don't want to
remember most of them.

18:12.357 --> 18:15.560
On every level, my childhood
was a fucking nightmare.

18:19.430 --> 18:20.632
I'm sorry.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.502
You don't have to be sorry.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.773
I just felt like
you deserved the truth.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.809
I don't like starting with lies.

18:31.911 --> 18:36.347
Well, thank you... and my turn.

18:37.448 --> 18:38.818
My childhood wasn't much better.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.686
I mean, I had parents...

18:41.720 --> 18:43.756
but they weren't
really there for me.

18:43.789 --> 18:47.458
My ex-wife used to say that's why
I was so obsessed with security.

18:47.492 --> 18:50.428
- But I'm sick of being cautious.
- Good.

18:53.631 --> 18:55.333
What the fuck?

18:56.568 --> 18:57.569
Hey!

18:59.772 --> 19:01.406
Yeah, you! Hey!

19:01.439 --> 19:03.675
Get away from my car, man.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.078
We don't want any problem.
Just take off, all right?

19:06.111 --> 19:08.546
What you gonna do?
Have the lady protect you? Huh?

19:08.580 --> 19:09.791
All right, forget it. Forget it.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.117
How about I kill you and I fuck
your hot girlfriend, huh?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.518
- Go fuck yourself!
- Sky.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.722
- I kill you, bitch!
- Go on, stay back!

19:16.755 --> 19:18.157
- Ow!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

19:20.525 --> 19:22.862
God!

19:47.485 --> 19:49.788
Couch is fine. Thanks.

19:49.822 --> 19:53.558
The nurse from the private
care service shows up at 5:00.

19:53.591 --> 19:55.794
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

19:55.828 --> 19:56.829
It's fine.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.529
- It's fine.
- Can I help you?

19:58.563 --> 20:01.033
- It's okay. I'm all right.
- What do you need, huh?

20:11.643 --> 20:12.644
Here, here.

20:20.920 --> 20:25.224
Thanks for, uh, bringing me back
and hanging around.

20:25.257 --> 20:28.794
It's the least I could do.
I mean, it's my fault.

20:28.827 --> 20:31.230
- If I hadn't told that punk to go fuck himself...
- Hey.

20:31.263 --> 20:36.467
It sucks. It's not forever.
Right?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.105
Is there anything I can get you?

20:40.139 --> 20:42.775
- I feel really bad.
- Good.

20:42.808 --> 20:45.844
Maybe you'll feel guilty enough
to visit me every now and then.

20:47.212 --> 20:49.181
I bet I could take
better care of you

20:49.214 --> 20:50.883
than some hatchet-faced nurse.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.851
How do you know
she's hatchet-faced?

20:52.885 --> 20:55.754
Pretty sure it's part of
the job description.

20:55.788 --> 20:59.124
Mm. So, you wanna be my nurse...

21:00.159 --> 21:02.962
and take care of me?

21:03.628 --> 21:04.730
Why not?

21:05.731 --> 21:06.799
Mm.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.002
What are your qualifications?

21:11.569 --> 21:14.039
Well, I can fix a mean omelet.

21:15.741 --> 21:18.043
- I can cook for you.
- Mm-hm.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.979
Make sure you take your meds.

21:20.012 --> 21:23.514
- Shop, run errands.
- Escape your crazy roommate.

21:23.548 --> 21:26.551
Yeah. That too.

21:28.053 --> 21:30.756
And I'm willing to have
sex with my patient.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.926
Well, in that case,
you're hired.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.282
All right, I'll call
the rent-a-nurse agency.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.074
You take the Range,
head down the hill,

21:49.108 --> 21:51.576
- bring back your stuff.
- Okay.

21:57.082 --> 22:00.886
Wait. If you're asleep,
how do I get back in?

22:00.919 --> 22:04.555
Uh, guess you'll need the codes.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.195
Fuck!

22:10.229 --> 22:11.562
<i>The earth's atmosphere</i>

22:11.596 --> 22:13.799
<i>makes the male aliens sterile,</i>

22:13.832 --> 22:16.035
<i>so, in order to reproduce,
the female aliens</i>

22:16.068 --> 22:18.704
<i>have gotta mate
with human males.</i>

22:18.737 --> 22:23.108
<i>However, the female aliens'
reproductive organs are quite large</i>

22:23.142 --> 22:25.844
<i>and only extremely
well-endowed human...</i>

22:41.960 --> 22:45.798
You look like a puppy waiting
for its owner to come home.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.099
Leave me alone, Ronald.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.904
- You were happier before.
- What?

22:53.238 --> 22:55.741
Before Sky moved in.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.677
That's none of your business.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.715
Well, actually, it is,

23:03.749 --> 23:06.552
'cause I'm not just your
landlord, I'm your friend.

23:08.787 --> 23:10.688
Maybe your only real friend.

23:11.757 --> 23:13.992
What's that supposed to mean?

23:14.026 --> 23:17.129
Oh, Ronald, you're just jealous.

23:20.065 --> 23:25.370
I bet you haven't been in
a relationship since... never.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.906
- When you didn't come home...
- Let's talk about that inside.

23:27.940 --> 23:32.111
Friendly reminder, ladies.
You're two weeks behind on the rent again.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.313
I'd hate to have to evict you.

23:34.346 --> 23:37.282
Ronald, if you evict us,

23:37.316 --> 23:40.152
you won't be able to spy on us
in our bikinis anymore.

23:42.020 --> 23:46.657
You know what, Sky,
don't play games with me.

23:46.691 --> 23:49.394
I'm not the kind of man
you want to trifle with.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.366
Yeah.

23:58.470 --> 24:00.081
What the fuck?
You're not gonna say anything?

24:00.105 --> 24:03.175
Explain where the fuck
you were all night?

24:03.208 --> 24:05.811
- It's for the best.
- It's for the fucking best?

24:05.844 --> 24:09.948
- Well, I know things, Sky.
- You don't know anything.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.284
- Oh, I don't know anything?
- Yeah.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.286
Don't I? Huh?

24:21.026 --> 24:22.928
Lisa, come here.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.268
Hey, hey.

24:30.736 --> 24:32.104
You're right.

24:34.406 --> 24:36.875
I do owe you an explanation.

24:50.889 --> 24:53.959
Sky, if you leave me, I'll die.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.795
I know.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.720
Chris.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.996
Wake up.

25:37.936 --> 25:40.005
Wake up, you sleepyhead.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.776
- Mm.
- How's my patient?

25:46.411 --> 25:48.780
Better now
that his nurse is here.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.017
Did you get your stuff?

25:52.484 --> 25:53.952
Mm-hm.

26:02.027 --> 26:05.497
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.541
You're a little hot.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.444
Well, so are you.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.181
Can you blame me?

26:28.053 --> 26:31.123
God, I love the taste of you.

26:40.966 --> 26:43.502
You need your rest.
I won't bother you.

26:43.535 --> 26:47.806
Oh, no, no, no, bother me.
Bother me.

27:29.681 --> 27:32.117
Hey, help me out, would you?

27:32.150 --> 27:34.186
I think I overdid it
a little bit.

27:45.397 --> 27:48.066
- How's your pain?
- Feels like the whole

27:48.100 --> 27:50.469
right side of my body's
gonna fall off.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.539
Take this.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.147
Close your eyes
and go to dreamland.

28:03.582 --> 28:04.983
Hey, Sky.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.485
Yeah?

28:07.285 --> 28:08.553
I love you.

28:11.056 --> 28:13.125
It's the drugs.

28:13.158 --> 28:15.427
Yeah, well,
maybe you should take some.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.530
See if you feel the same way.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.233
I already do.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.237
It scares the hell out of me.

28:28.073 --> 28:29.307
Me, too.

28:31.309 --> 28:33.078
What are we going to do?

28:36.047 --> 28:37.983
Live happily ever after.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.063
Lisa!

28:54.566 --> 28:58.603
Lisa, it's Ronald.
I needed to talk to you about the rent.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.710
Lisa, I'm gonna open up.
You don't give me any choice.

29:06.445 --> 29:07.979
Lisa!

29:11.082 --> 29:12.384
Lisa.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.320
Are you decent?

29:18.023 --> 29:19.691
Hope not.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.059
Lisa.

29:36.541 --> 29:37.710
Lisa.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.681
Lisa?

30:13.713 --> 30:16.014
Chris.

30:23.756 --> 30:26.792
Lisa was my tenant
for over eight years.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.493
I mean, sweet kid. She...

30:28.527 --> 30:30.662
Well, she was like
a daughter to me.

30:31.864 --> 30:34.633
Any reason to think
it wasn't a suicide?

30:34.666 --> 30:36.769
No. She was despondent.

30:36.802 --> 30:39.638
You know,
her-her roommate had left her.

30:39.671 --> 30:45.377
You know, when I say roommate,
I mean in the Greek sense.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.714
Yeah, uh, the roommate,
Skyler Webb.

30:48.748 --> 30:53.853
You ever see an actual ID to
verify that was her real name?

30:53.886 --> 30:56.321
No. Why?

30:57.322 --> 30:58.657
Because we have no record

30:58.690 --> 31:02.227
of a Sky or Skyler Webb
in any of our databases.

31:02.260 --> 31:05.096
Are you kidding? I knew there
was something shady about...

31:05.130 --> 31:07.299
You gotta be shitting me.

31:07.332 --> 31:09.301
Who the fuck called them, huh?

31:09.334 --> 31:11.536
- Who the fuck called the press?
- Excuse me, sir.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.681
- Hello.
- Could you tell us...

31:12.705 --> 31:14.339
Excuse me, Detective. Um, hi.

31:14.372 --> 31:18.476
My name is Ronald Graham,
I'm the manager of this motel,

31:18.510 --> 31:21.112
and I'd like to make
a brief statement now,

31:21.146 --> 31:23.816
which I will read,
and then I'll answer any questions.

31:23.849 --> 31:30.188
Now, this-this property was
built by my parents in 1947,

31:30.221 --> 31:32.424
- and it was used as...
- Excuse me, sir.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.626
Get her out of here!
Lady, walk away!

31:34.659 --> 31:36.695
- Sir...
- Walk away, right now.

31:36.729 --> 31:40.265
Assholes. Locusts.

31:40.298 --> 31:43.602
<i>Hey, Chris.
I'm following up on the signature thing.</i>

31:43.635 --> 31:46.137
Yeah, um...

31:46.171 --> 31:49.407
Look, I'm a little out of it right now.
Can we... Can we talk later?

31:49.441 --> 31:52.410
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>

31:52.444 --> 31:56.314
I had a dumb accident.
Broke my leg.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.149
- <i>Oh, God.</i>
- Yeah.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.585
Um, no permanent damage,

32:00.619 --> 32:02.798
but I won't be running marathons
for the next few weeks.

32:02.822 --> 32:06.424
<i>I'm so sorry. Would it
cheer you up to see Willow?</i>

32:06.458 --> 32:11.563
<i>She's been asking about you, and I can drive
her over, let's say, on Friday morning?</i>

32:13.498 --> 32:16.635
Yeah. Yeah, do that.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.237
She can sign her name
on my cast,

32:19.270 --> 32:23.743
and, um, you can pick up
the papers at the same time.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.344
<i>That sounds good.</i>

32:27.445 --> 32:29.381
<i>Um, are you sure you're okay?</i>

32:29.414 --> 32:31.751
<i>Is someone taking care of you?</i>

32:31.784 --> 32:34.519
I hired a private care nurse.

32:34.552 --> 32:38.256
<i>That must be odd,
having a stranger in your house.</i>

32:38.289 --> 32:40.358
<i>That's a big thing for you.</i>

32:41.727 --> 32:44.229
Actually, we're doing fine.
Talk later.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.403
Hey, Sky?

32:56.842 --> 32:58.243
Sky!

33:00.679 --> 33:03.381
Sky?

33:39.985 --> 33:41.787
Shit!

33:49.627 --> 33:51.463
Can't say I blame you.

33:52.732 --> 33:54.699
Sorry. I was just...

33:54.734 --> 33:59.437
Uh, I was obviously snooping.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.007
Don't feel guilty.

34:02.041 --> 34:04.542
Hey, if I was in your place,
I'd do the same.

34:07.079 --> 34:09.915
Nobody's who they say they are.

34:09.949 --> 34:12.752
Maybe you're not who you say you are.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.387
Dry my back, please.

35:16.648 --> 35:22.087
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

35:22.121 --> 35:28.393
All good children go to heaven.

35:28.426 --> 35:34.099
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

35:34.133 --> 35:39.972
All good children go to heaven.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.396
Sky?

36:11.603 --> 36:12.805
What the hell?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.374
Where the fuck did I put it?

36:26.085 --> 36:27.418
What?

36:47.139 --> 36:48.573
Lisa.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.897
Hey! I got fried chicken.
You like chicken, right?

37:14.967 --> 37:20.873
- Yeah, sure.
- Good 'cause I got a lot.

37:20.906 --> 37:25.177
I don't know about
you, but I'm starving.

37:28.579 --> 37:32.017
- I thought models didn't eat.
- Oh, that's a lie.

37:32.051 --> 37:34.153
We eat like truck drivers.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.123
Anyways,
I'm not a model anymore.

37:38.157 --> 37:40.159
I'm a private care nurse.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.532
You smell that?

37:48.599 --> 37:49.868
You see my phone?

37:51.136 --> 37:53.038
I'm sure it's
around here somewhere.

37:53.072 --> 37:55.673
I'll help you find it
after we eat.

37:56.809 --> 37:58.543
Here.

37:58.576 --> 37:59.745
Dig in, Chris.

38:00.980 --> 38:02.781
Can I use your phone?

38:02.815 --> 38:06.185
Sure. After we eat. Eat.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.624
Chris, what's wrong?

38:15.761 --> 38:16.795
Uh...

38:19.965 --> 38:21.599
Sky, I, um...

38:24.203 --> 38:27.605
I saw something... on the news.

38:28.273 --> 38:30.042
Okay.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.543
Was it something good
or something bad?

38:34.645 --> 38:38.183
It's your roommate... Lisa.

38:38.217 --> 38:39.284
What about her?

38:42.121 --> 38:43.554
She died.

38:54.033 --> 38:56.301
Sky, you should probably
contact the police.

38:57.302 --> 38:58.837
That would be stupid of me.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.539
Why?

39:02.908 --> 39:04.710
Because I'm the one
who killed her.

39:06.078 --> 39:09.048
This is the best chicken.
No kidding.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.681
Here, have some.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.154
You killed her?

39:16.221 --> 39:17.256
Had to.

39:20.259 --> 39:25.064
Sky, if this is some sort of
joke, it's not fucking funny.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.999
It's no joke, Chris.

39:28.167 --> 39:30.235
Lisa wasn't a bad roommate.

39:30.269 --> 39:33.305
I mean,
she wasn't even a bad lover.

39:33.338 --> 39:36.809
But on the downside,
she had some jealousy issues,

39:36.842 --> 39:39.178
and she was too nosey.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.713
But she had the apartment.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.017
The perfect place
to watch you from.

39:46.318 --> 39:49.721
- Watch me?
- For the last two months.

39:49.755 --> 39:52.657
I do my homework, Chris.

39:52.690 --> 39:55.194
I know everything
that happens around here.

39:55.227 --> 39:59.098
<i>Like how your gardener and cleaning
lady won't be here for another six days.</i>

39:59.131 --> 40:01.333
How you never get visitors.

40:01.366 --> 40:06.105
Exact times you sleep, eat,
shit, piss, swim and work out.

40:07.272 --> 40:09.674
When and where
you do your groceries.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.244
Where to accidentally
bump into you.

40:13.812 --> 40:17.850
All of this was
some sort of con job?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.052
A set-up?

40:21.086 --> 40:22.354
Now you're catching on.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.026
Get out of my house.

40:28.060 --> 40:30.896
Get the fuck out of my house!

40:30.929 --> 40:34.199
Naturally,
you're angry and confused.

40:34.233 --> 40:35.968
Who wouldn't be?

40:43.809 --> 40:45.244
Look what I found.

40:45.277 --> 40:46.945
Give that back!

40:51.750 --> 40:53.051
Sorry, lover.

40:56.021 --> 40:57.723
Honeymoon's over.

41:08.367 --> 41:09.935
Oh, Jesus.

41:43.869 --> 41:44.937
Hm.

41:49.041 --> 41:51.243
Should be worth a few bucks.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.146
Jesus.

42:03.789 --> 42:04.823
Oh...

42:12.798 --> 42:13.799
Wow.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.238
Hot yoga.

42:21.240 --> 42:22.541
Jesus.

42:22.574 --> 42:25.344
One, two, three, and stretch.

42:25.377 --> 42:28.280
One, two, three, and stretch.

42:32.451 --> 42:36.455
Stay right there...
don't move a muscle.

43:00.612 --> 43:02.881
Down to business.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.017
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.457
Why are you doing this?

43:12.491 --> 43:16.061
Because you're rich
and you have things I want.

43:18.463 --> 43:21.366
Fuck you!
You lying fucking bitch!

43:33.512 --> 43:35.947
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

43:35.981 --> 43:39.484
You think I'm gonna
help you steal my life?

43:39.518 --> 43:41.553
- That's what you are, right?
- Hm?

43:41.586 --> 43:43.989
A goddamn identity thief.

43:44.022 --> 43:46.491
It'll go better
if you cooperate.

43:47.893 --> 43:50.228
I fucking hate you!

43:50.262 --> 43:52.030
I'm not telling you jack shit!

43:52.064 --> 43:55.600
Yeah, I thought you
might be obstinate...

43:55.634 --> 43:58.270
so I picked up
this little persuader

43:58.303 --> 44:00.305
in the torture aisle
at the hardware store.

44:04.109 --> 44:06.178
- It's scary, right?
- Oh, fuck!

44:10.549 --> 44:13.185
I need all your passwords
and security codes.

44:13.218 --> 44:15.487
Go fuck yourself.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.888
Okay.

44:19.792 --> 44:21.326
What's your mother's
maiden name?

44:21.360 --> 44:22.394
- Huh?
- Oh, fuck!

44:22.427 --> 44:25.997
Mother's maiden name.

44:38.543 --> 44:40.245
Oh...

44:40.278 --> 44:42.180
Same time tomorrow.

45:14.112 --> 45:16.081
No fucking way.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.214
Morning, sunshine.

46:19.544 --> 46:21.079
All better now?

46:24.382 --> 46:26.485
I didn't want to
hurt you last night...

46:28.220 --> 46:31.122
but I needed you to know
how serious I am.

46:32.825 --> 46:34.192
Sky...

46:38.230 --> 46:40.165
Is that even your real name?

46:46.404 --> 46:47.606
No...

46:49.709 --> 46:53.345
This morning, thanks to
the information you gave me,

46:53.378 --> 46:54.479
I took the easy stuff.

46:56.448 --> 46:58.049
But in this next phase,

46:58.083 --> 47:00.552
this is where I'm gonna need
your fullest cooperation.

47:03.522 --> 47:06.258
We have some Zoom calls to make
to your bankers and brokers

47:06.291 --> 47:10.529
to liquidate your stock,
to fund my new company: SkyCo.

47:10.562 --> 47:12.364
SkyCo.

47:12.397 --> 47:14.633
That means I can't have you
looking like this.

47:17.469 --> 47:21.540
Sky, you are a very,
very naughty girl.

47:22.574 --> 47:25.277
Don't want to cut you.

47:46.732 --> 47:50.068
Okay, I'm gonna
give you that one.

47:51.737 --> 47:55.607
But I need you to know
why you have to cooperate.

48:00.746 --> 48:02.314
What's at stake.

48:10.188 --> 48:12.324
No, please don't hurt them.
Please don't hurt them.

48:12.357 --> 48:13.425
Please, please, please...

48:13.458 --> 48:16.361
I'm hoping I won't have to.

48:16.394 --> 48:20.165
I think five is the cutest age.
Don't you?

49:14.820 --> 49:17.923
- How's the knee, dude?
- Fuck you!

49:17.957 --> 49:19.457
I do good work, don't I?

49:19.491 --> 49:21.693
Leave him alone, Ki-Ju.
We've got business.

49:21.727 --> 49:25.230
I know you'll give me your best price
for the art and the wine collection.

49:25.263 --> 49:26.766
Anything for you, Sky.

49:26.799 --> 49:29.802
We'll pay top dollar
for the rugs and furniture, too.

49:29.835 --> 49:32.504
Everything goes, lover boy.

49:32.537 --> 49:36.174
I'm stripping you
down to the studs.

51:22.614 --> 51:25.683
You know, I always wondered what
one of these places was like inside.

51:25.718 --> 51:28.954
When you grow up in the flats,
you're always looking up

51:28.988 --> 51:32.024
at the house on the hill
and wondering.

51:32.057 --> 51:36.796
Well, now I know.
Mystery solved.

51:36.829 --> 51:42.935
I waited for her to leave,
Sky or Sly or Bi.

51:42.968 --> 51:45.938
Whatever it is
she calls herself.

51:45.971 --> 51:48.506
I always knew she was
some kind of scammer.

51:48.540 --> 51:50.943
You know, people like you,

51:50.976 --> 51:54.947
you always think that people seek
you out because you're interesting.

51:54.980 --> 52:00.019
No. People seek you out
because you're rich.

52:00.052 --> 52:03.889
I looked this property up on Google
Earth and I did an owner search.

52:03.923 --> 52:07.392
Apparently, there is
a Christopher Decker

52:07.425 --> 52:11.663
who bought it for
3.5 million bucks, in cash.

52:11.696 --> 52:14.133
Would that be you by any chance?

52:14.166 --> 52:17.736
And this same guy
sold his internet company

52:17.770 --> 52:21.073
to some chucklehead
for millions of dollars.

52:21.106 --> 52:26.511
And now, you're just what we
need, another rich tech dork.

52:26.544 --> 52:28.714
Yeah, tell me your story.

52:28.747 --> 52:31.784
Call the police
before she comes back!

52:31.817 --> 52:34.920
She's a fucking killer!
Call the police!

52:36.421 --> 52:37.957
Why are you just standing there?

52:37.990 --> 52:39.825
Help me! Fucking help me!

52:39.859 --> 52:41.794
She might already
know you're here!

52:46.899 --> 52:49.835
Money? Money.
You want money. Yeah?

52:49.869 --> 52:53.638
- Some kind of rescue fee?
- That's the least you could do, I would say.

52:53.671 --> 52:57.810
Okay. Whatever you want, just get this
fucking tape off me and call the police.

52:57.843 --> 53:02.081
- I want a hundred grand.
- A hundred grand, okay. Just fucking free me.

53:02.114 --> 53:05.450
Okay, well, that was too fucking
easy, so now I want 200 grand.

53:05.483 --> 53:07.652
Okay, two hundred,
three hundred, whatever!

53:07.685 --> 53:09.654
Just fucking help me! Help me!

53:09.687 --> 53:12.590
You're on layaway until
I get the cash, buster.

53:13.959 --> 53:15.828
I don't keep
that kind of cash in the house.

53:15.861 --> 53:17.930
Oh, you don't?
What do you keep in the house?

53:17.963 --> 53:21.499
A watch collection? Jewelry?

53:21.532 --> 53:23.702
- Artwork?
- What you fucking talking about?

53:30.175 --> 53:31.442
Who is that?

53:34.213 --> 53:37.783
- That's a Picasso.
- Are you shitting me?

53:37.816 --> 53:40.185
Wow. What's that worth?

53:40.219 --> 53:41.887
Um...

53:42.821 --> 53:44.790
Six or seven million.

53:44.823 --> 53:46.926
Six or seven million?

53:46.959 --> 53:50.628
- And it's yours.
- It certainly is.

53:50.662 --> 53:54.199
Okay. Okay. It's a deal, right?

53:54.233 --> 53:57.202
And now I'll get
the tape off you.

54:02.875 --> 54:06.577
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

54:06.611 --> 54:09.915
Jesus. Looks like she did a
pretty fucking good job though.

54:09.949 --> 54:12.517
Almost like
she's done it before.

54:20.558 --> 54:22.527
Forget the tape.
Call the police.

54:22.560 --> 54:26.131
No, first me and my painting
get the fuck out of here,

54:26.165 --> 54:27.275
then you call whoever you...

54:27.299 --> 54:29.868
No, she took my phone.
She ripped out the landlines.

54:29.902 --> 54:31.502
Use your phone.

54:35.240 --> 54:36.507
What's that?

54:40.813 --> 54:42.114
She's back.

54:42.948 --> 54:44.783
Sky?

54:44.817 --> 54:47.086
You need to call the police now.

54:47.119 --> 54:48.854
Give-give me your phone.

54:48.887 --> 54:51.790
I told you, she ripped out
all the land lines!

54:51.824 --> 54:55.260
- You don't have a phone?
- Fuck no! It causes brain cancer!

54:55.294 --> 54:58.130
You haven't heard of 5G,
tech wiz?

55:11.676 --> 55:16.215
I'm sorry. You probably
got your hopes up, right?

55:22.755 --> 55:24.957
Stay back!

55:24.990 --> 55:27.592
I'm not afraid to use this.

55:27.625 --> 55:28.727
I mean it!

55:31.096 --> 55:34.299
Yeah. How did you find me?

55:37.002 --> 55:39.637
- Your telescope.
- Ah, shit.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.974
Makes me wonder
who was stupider?

55:42.007 --> 55:44.143
Me for leaving the telescope,

55:44.176 --> 55:48.579
or you, Ronald McDonald,
for showing up here all by yourself.

55:48.613 --> 55:53.185
Listen, I have no idea what you two
are up to, and I don't want to know.

55:53.218 --> 55:56.355
And I'm not gonna tell anyone.
You just let me go.

55:56.388 --> 55:58.323
- Hm.
- Stay back.

55:58.357 --> 56:02.161
Hey, Ronald.
That's your name, right?

56:05.030 --> 56:08.633
- Kill her.
- "Kill her"?

56:08.666 --> 56:11.937
Stab her, goddamnit.
Fucking stab her!

56:11.970 --> 56:14.639
Hey! Hey! Hey!

56:14.672 --> 56:16.975
No! No, no, no!

56:17.009 --> 56:19.711
- Okay.
- Fuck!

56:19.745 --> 56:23.082
Why don't you watch a little TV
while I show our guest around?

56:24.216 --> 56:26.785
- Fuck you!
- Oh, Ronald!

56:43.969 --> 56:45.104
Fuck!

56:52.978 --> 56:54.246
Ronald?

57:34.286 --> 57:35.686
Fuck!

57:43.228 --> 57:44.396
Hi, there.

58:05.784 --> 58:07.886
Please. Please.
It's worth so much money!

58:14.259 --> 58:16.228
I won't tell a soul. Please.

58:21.233 --> 58:23.035
Please, let me go.

58:56.568 --> 59:00.138
Jesus Christ! You okay?

59:00.172 --> 59:03.008
- Hey!
- Please. Please. Hey, get me out of here!

59:03.041 --> 59:06.178
All right. All right. Okay.
You're okay.

59:06.211 --> 59:07.488
There's a woman
trying to kill me.

59:07.512 --> 59:09.414
We have to
get out of here right now.

59:09.448 --> 59:12.050
Where? Where? Where?
I don't see any woman.

59:12.084 --> 59:13.352
All right.

59:13.385 --> 59:15.520
She's not gonna touch you.
I got you.

59:15.554 --> 59:18.056
I got you, pal. You're safe.

59:18.090 --> 59:19.825
- She's coming.
- There's no one coming.

59:19.858 --> 59:21.293
She's gonna fucking kill you!

59:21.326 --> 59:25.464
- Oh, fuck!
- Hey! Breathe, breathe. Relax, relax.

59:25.497 --> 59:27.299
- We have to go.
- We're gonna go.

59:27.332 --> 59:30.902
Hey, look, man!
There's no woman! You're safe!

59:32.838 --> 59:35.874
Come on. I got you.
You all right? All right.

59:36.875 --> 59:38.310
I'm gonna get you out of here.

59:41.947 --> 59:45.417
- Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
- You say a woman's trying to kill you?

59:45.450 --> 59:48.920
- Is she your wife?
- No, no, we need to call the police.

59:48.954 --> 59:51.132
- Have you got a phone?
- Yeah, of course I got a phone, man.

59:51.156 --> 59:52.457
- Hold on.
- Fuck!

59:52.491 --> 59:54.293
Call 911.

59:54.326 --> 59:56.061
Tell them my name
is Christopher Decker.

59:56.094 --> 59:58.230
I live at 4522 Ridgeline Drive.

59:58.263 --> 01:00:01.500
All right. It's ringing. Yeah.

01:00:01.533 --> 01:00:04.269
Hello. Police emergency. Yeah.

01:00:04.303 --> 01:00:08.307
Listen, I got a kid here,
Christopher... Hold on, hold on.

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.908
You tell them. You tell them.

01:00:09.941 --> 01:00:12.577
- Hello?
- <i>Please state the nature of your emergency.</i>

01:00:12.611 --> 01:00:16.381
My name is Christopher Decker!
I live in 4522 Ridgeline Drive!

01:00:16.415 --> 01:00:19.384
There's a woman in my house,
she's imprisoned me against my will.

01:00:19.418 --> 01:00:22.254
She's trying to steal my identity.
She wants to kill me.

01:00:22.287 --> 01:00:25.157
She-she already killed a guy
with a fucking sword!

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:26.958
- What?
- <i>Where are you now, sir?</i>

01:00:26.992 --> 01:00:29.461
- <i>Are you safe?</i>
- Yeah, yeah. I'm in a car.

01:00:29.494 --> 01:00:31.163
- I'm heading...
- Yeah.

01:00:31.196 --> 01:00:32.964
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- <i>Mr. Decker, sir.</i>

01:00:32.998 --> 01:00:35.167
<i>Are you there?
I need you to stay on the line.</i>

01:00:49.581 --> 01:00:52.084
You should have seen
the look on your face.

01:00:52.117 --> 01:00:54.152
Man, it was priceless.

01:00:54.186 --> 01:00:56.521
Don't try that again.

01:00:59.391 --> 01:01:00.859
Oh, wow.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.097
Wow. That's a lot of wood.

01:01:07.466 --> 01:01:08.467
Huh.

01:01:12.304 --> 01:01:15.307
- Well, who'd you kill?
- My landlord.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.477
Oh. That's a good way
to save on rent.

01:01:23.415 --> 01:01:25.984
I'm gonna go wash off.

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:29.454
I'm gonna get acquainted
with our friend, Chris.

01:01:29.488 --> 01:01:32.657
The two men in my life.
Play nice.

01:01:38.397 --> 01:01:40.332
I really like your lifestyle.

01:01:42.667 --> 01:01:44.903
I mean, at least
what's left of it.

01:01:48.407 --> 01:01:49.574
And you are?

01:01:51.276 --> 01:01:53.912
I am Sky's stepfather.

01:01:55.748 --> 01:01:56.748
It's crazy, right?

01:01:58.316 --> 01:02:00.419
When she was 14,
I married her mother.

01:02:00.452 --> 01:02:03.655
And a couple of months later,
her mother passed...

01:02:03.688 --> 01:02:07.259
let's just say unexpectedly.

01:02:07.292 --> 01:02:10.228
So ever since then
it's been me and Sky,

01:02:10.262 --> 01:02:13.432
together, against the world.

01:02:15.267 --> 01:02:17.235
That's nice stuff.

01:02:18.704 --> 01:02:22.307
You know, even then
she was... she was special.

01:02:23.776 --> 01:02:25.277
I don't have to tell you that.

01:02:27.579 --> 01:02:32.017
So I nurtured it,
and I trained her...

01:02:33.185 --> 01:02:35.387
in the fine art of deception

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:37.422
and identity theft.

01:02:39.424 --> 01:02:40.992
That's sickening.

01:02:41.026 --> 01:02:43.428
Huh.

01:02:43.462 --> 01:02:45.263
I just brought out
the girl's true nature,

01:02:45.297 --> 01:02:48.667
and trust me, Sky was a natural.

01:02:50.235 --> 01:02:53.004
Especially when it
came to seducing young,

01:02:53.038 --> 01:02:55.240
lonely guys like you.

01:02:56.641 --> 01:03:00.111
And that's justification
for stealing my life, right?

01:03:00.145 --> 01:03:01.246
Well...

01:03:02.347 --> 01:03:04.149
don't think of it as stealing.

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:06.585
Think of it as giving back.

01:03:06.618 --> 01:03:10.455
- "Giving back."
- Yeah, you're a successful guy!

01:03:10.489 --> 01:03:13.158
Successful rich guy,
aren't you, Chris?

01:03:13.191 --> 01:03:17.496
Huh? You didn't get it
all on your own, did you?

01:03:19.064 --> 01:03:21.299
Did you?

01:03:21.333 --> 01:03:24.436
Cracks me up, guys like you think
you got it 'cause you're so smart.

01:03:24.469 --> 01:03:27.572
Bullshit.
That's not why you got this!

01:03:27.606 --> 01:03:29.474
Lot of people are smart!

01:03:32.544 --> 01:03:34.179
What about the rest of us?

01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:39.351
Huh? Down there! Look!

01:03:39.384 --> 01:03:44.055
Down there! You see them, Chris?
You see them?

01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:46.625
Because I guarantee
they see you.

01:03:48.493 --> 01:03:50.462
Sitting up here all protected.

01:03:50.495 --> 01:03:53.365
Safe in your big fortress.

01:04:01.139 --> 01:04:04.042
Let me tell you something...
Chris.

01:04:05.811 --> 01:04:07.612
While you're
looking down at them,

01:04:08.748 --> 01:04:10.315
they're looking up at you.

01:04:11.416 --> 01:04:14.553
Those hungry eyes.

01:04:14.586 --> 01:04:17.656
Don't you feel it? Watching.

01:04:17.689 --> 01:04:20.793
Waiting till the day
they come up here

01:04:20.826 --> 01:04:23.729
and they take
all your shit from you.

01:04:33.638 --> 01:04:34.707
You done?

01:04:36.308 --> 01:04:38.109
Am I done?

01:04:39.779 --> 01:04:43.248
You can't twist this
into socio-political bullshit.

01:04:44.282 --> 01:04:46.418
I don't look down on them.

01:04:46.919 --> 01:04:49.120
Just you.

01:04:50.221 --> 01:04:53.158
You and Sky are thieves.

01:04:53.191 --> 01:04:55.460
You're just fucking killers.

01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:02.500
You could've
done this to anybody.

01:05:02.534 --> 01:05:04.636
A thousand other people.

01:05:06.872 --> 01:05:09.174
Why did you
have to steal my life?

01:05:11.744 --> 01:05:13.578
'Cause you weren't using it!

01:05:16.749 --> 01:05:18.116
Chris.

01:05:47.212 --> 01:05:51.282
Hey. I'm sorry,
I had to feed the wolf.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:58.289
Don't tell him I said so, but...

01:05:58.323 --> 01:06:00.392
he's not half the lover you are.

01:06:02.661 --> 01:06:06.398
Every word that comes out
of your mouth is a lie.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.234
Let's not fight.

01:06:13.505 --> 01:06:15.741
Honestly?

01:06:15.775 --> 01:06:17.877
I'll be sorry
to leave this place.

01:06:20.311 --> 01:06:22.180
It really was nice for a while.

01:06:23.615 --> 01:06:26.919
Like living in
an alternative universe.

01:06:26.952 --> 01:06:30.321
Especially those first early days
when we were so deeply in love.

01:06:32.758 --> 01:06:34.459
You could have had it all.

01:06:37.763 --> 01:06:38.764
What?

01:06:39.765 --> 01:06:41.834
I would have given it to you.

01:06:44.003 --> 01:06:45.871
You didn't have to take it.

01:06:47.707 --> 01:06:51.744
This. All of it. Us.

01:06:51.777 --> 01:06:53.611
Anything you wanted.

01:06:55.915 --> 01:06:57.983
I loved you, Sky.

01:07:01.787 --> 01:07:03.621
It's a nice dream.

01:07:05.523 --> 01:07:07.358
But that's all it is, Chris.

01:07:07.392 --> 01:07:08.761
A dream.

01:07:10.595 --> 01:07:12.865
But why are you still here?

01:07:14.499 --> 01:07:18.971
You've taken everything from me.
You've bled me dry.

01:07:23.475 --> 01:07:25.911
You're such a shitty liar.

01:07:27.345 --> 01:07:29.481
Just shows in your eyes.

01:07:34.452 --> 01:07:38.858
You've taken... everything.

01:07:41.794 --> 01:07:43.996
Except for those bearer bonds.

01:07:45.831 --> 01:07:47.833
Slipped your mind, did it?

01:07:49.068 --> 01:07:52.071
Fourteen million dollars
in bearer bonds,

01:07:52.104 --> 01:07:56.041
in a safe deposit box in the
main branch of American Bank.

01:07:57.977 --> 01:08:00.678
It's just the liquid bulk
of your fortune...

01:08:01.646 --> 01:08:04.482
and you forgot to tell me.

01:08:04.516 --> 01:08:06.484
Did you really think
I didn't know?

01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:12.858
I even have the key to your box.
I found it in your floor safe.

01:08:12.892 --> 01:08:15.795
That's why you
haven't killed me yet.

01:08:15.828 --> 01:08:17.029
Isn't it?

01:08:18.363 --> 01:08:20.465
Hm?

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:24.904
The biometric scanner
at the bank. My thumb print.

01:08:24.937 --> 01:08:28.841
You can't get into the vault
without my thumb print.

01:08:28.874 --> 01:08:30.943
Very true.

01:08:39.551 --> 01:08:41.419
I don't care what you do to me.

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:43.788
I'm not coming with you.

01:08:44.823 --> 01:08:45.957
No, you're not.

01:09:17.455 --> 01:09:19.091
Looks like Daddy has company.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:26.832
Can I go get
Leo the Lion from my room?

01:09:26.866 --> 01:09:29.068
Sure, sweetie.

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.667
Daddy!

01:09:40.545 --> 01:09:41.578
Chris!

01:09:43.182 --> 01:09:44.850
What's going on here?

01:09:52.457 --> 01:09:53.691
Willow?

01:09:54.927 --> 01:09:57.562
Willow, I said
come here right now!

01:09:57.595 --> 01:09:58.696
Willow!

01:10:03.936 --> 01:10:06.571
Lookie what I found.

01:10:06.604 --> 01:10:11.509
- I'm sorry, you are?
- I'm Sky, Chris's nurse.

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:13.746
This little cupcake
must be Willow.

01:10:13.779 --> 01:10:16.882
- Could you put me down, please?
- No, I can't.

01:10:16.916 --> 01:10:19.060
You're just too scrumptious
and I might just eat you up.

01:10:19.084 --> 01:10:21.854
Yeah. Put my daughter down,
please.

01:10:23.088 --> 01:10:26.058
Okay, the mother lion thing.
I get it.

01:10:27.558 --> 01:10:29.795
Come here. Good girl.

01:10:29.828 --> 01:10:31.997
Um, Chris didn't tell me
you were coming.

01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:35.034
- Yeah. Where is Chris?
- He's sleeping.

01:10:35.067 --> 01:10:36.701
Would you mind waking him up?

01:10:36.735 --> 01:10:39.238
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:10:39.271 --> 01:10:41.472
He had a very bad night.

01:10:41.506 --> 01:10:43.541
Maybe you should
just come back another time.

01:10:43.574 --> 01:10:46.211
Are you going to get Chris,
or do you want me to call the police?

01:10:46.245 --> 01:10:50.149
Whoa, there's no reason
to get the police involved.

01:10:50.182 --> 01:10:53.551
Chris, your wife and daughter
are here to see you.

01:10:54.887 --> 01:10:56.521
Daddy!

01:10:57.957 --> 01:10:59.892
No hug for Daddy?

01:11:04.696 --> 01:11:07.066
Who are you people?
Where's Chris?

01:11:10.035 --> 01:11:12.071
He's right here.

01:11:12.104 --> 01:11:14.073
- Oh, my God!
- Don't try anything funny.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.078
- Chris! Chris...
- Jamie?

01:11:19.111 --> 01:11:21.947
Yeah, it's me.
It's me, I'm here.

01:11:31.123 --> 01:11:32.623
Daddy!

01:11:38.563 --> 01:11:41.566
Who are these people?
What do they want?

01:11:42.968 --> 01:11:44.103
Everything.

01:12:22.107 --> 01:12:23.976
You seem different on this one.

01:12:25.844 --> 01:12:28.781
- What's going on with you?
- Nothing.

01:12:28.814 --> 01:12:30.883
Just focus on getting the bonds.

01:12:41.126 --> 01:12:43.162
It's so quiet.

01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:46.664
Daddy, you try it.

01:12:48.666 --> 01:12:52.304
I can't, baby.
Daddy hurt his hand.

01:12:53.372 --> 01:12:56.607
But we can play heads or tails.

01:12:56.641 --> 01:13:00.212
- Heads.
- Heads. That's a good choice.

01:13:09.855 --> 01:13:11.023
Look.

01:13:11.056 --> 01:13:13.258
- What?
- The vent.

01:13:14.827 --> 01:13:16.371
It's not big enough
for one of us, but...

01:13:16.395 --> 01:13:18.831
- I could do it.
- Okay, baby,

01:13:18.864 --> 01:13:20.265
we're gonna play
a fun game, okay?

01:13:20.299 --> 01:13:23.168
No, absolutely not.
No, it's too dangerous.

01:13:23.202 --> 01:13:24.870
- She's not going...
- Jamie!

01:13:26.238 --> 01:13:28.073
These people are monsters.

01:13:28.107 --> 01:13:30.742
If we don't escape
before they get back, they'll...

01:13:34.379 --> 01:13:35.948
We have to get out.

01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:42.888
- You must be Mr. and Mrs. Decker.
- Hey.

01:13:42.921 --> 01:13:44.655
I'm the vault officer,
Austin Briggs.

01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:45.991
Oh, sorry.

01:14:00.472 --> 01:14:02.207
All right, sweetheart,

01:14:02.241 --> 01:14:04.675
you're going to
get us out of here and then...

01:14:04.710 --> 01:14:06.712
we're going to
get some ice cream, okay?

01:14:07.813 --> 01:14:09.715
- Daddy, too?
- Yes, yes. Daddy, too.

01:14:09.748 --> 01:14:14.086
Oh, yeah. Chocolate chip.
Come here.

01:14:14.119 --> 01:14:16.889
Okay, it's the panel
next to the door.

01:14:16.922 --> 01:14:19.291
You remember the code?

01:14:19.324 --> 01:14:22.094
- What's the code?
- 0811, my birthday.

01:14:22.127 --> 01:14:24.695
That's right, your birthday.
You can do this, right?

01:14:25.964 --> 01:14:27.399
I know you can.

01:14:27.432 --> 01:14:30.802
Because you're so brave
and strong and smart.

01:14:30.836 --> 01:14:32.337
Oh, I love you so much.

01:14:39.511 --> 01:14:42.114
We'll just need
your thumb print, Mr. Decker.

01:14:42.147 --> 01:14:43.382
Oh, of course.

01:14:43.415 --> 01:14:44.783
Hope it won't be too painful.

01:14:44.816 --> 01:14:46.919
No pain, no gain.

01:14:55.327 --> 01:14:56.461
Be brave for me, okay, baby?

01:14:56.495 --> 01:14:59.097
Remember, once you're outside,

01:14:59.131 --> 01:15:01.733
go to the deck
in the front of the house, okay.

01:15:01.767 --> 01:15:05.337
We'll be right here, okay.

01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:06.939
You got this, Willow!

01:15:12.144 --> 01:15:13.512
Huh.

01:15:13.545 --> 01:15:15.185
Seems it's not reading
the heat signature.

01:15:16.915 --> 01:15:20.385
Must be the... try that again.

01:15:22.287 --> 01:15:24.890
Maybe my hand's
cold from the cast.

01:15:30.262 --> 01:15:32.898
Just keep going.
You're doing so well.

01:15:32.931 --> 01:15:34.011
Don't be scared, all right?

01:15:36.535 --> 01:15:37.836
I should probably call someone.

01:15:37.869 --> 01:15:39.404
No, no. Hold on one second.

01:15:40.973 --> 01:15:41.974
Wait-wait. There you go.

01:15:42.007 --> 01:15:43.175
- There you go.
- Ah!

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.810
Excellent.

01:15:44.843 --> 01:15:46.812
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Shall we go inside?

01:16:02.094 --> 01:16:06.064
- What did they do to you?
- They cut off my thumb.

01:16:06.098 --> 01:16:09.234
For the, um,
the fingerprint scanner at the bank.

01:16:09.268 --> 01:16:13.171
They're after the fucking bearer
bonds in the safe deposit box.

01:16:13.205 --> 01:16:14.906
Oh, shit.

01:16:19.011 --> 01:16:20.979
Okay. I'll be outside.

01:16:21.013 --> 01:16:23.315
Just push the call button
when you're ready to leave.

01:16:23.348 --> 01:16:25.784
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Briggs. You've been an angel.

01:16:28.353 --> 01:16:30.522
- The bearer bonds...
- What?

01:16:30.555 --> 01:16:32.457
They aren't there.

01:16:32.491 --> 01:16:34.960
<i>My lawyer told me to take them.
He said...</i>

01:16:34.993 --> 01:16:37.496
<i>Well, he said in case
we couldn't agree on support</i>

01:16:37.529 --> 01:16:40.432
that the bonds
would give me leverage.

01:16:44.303 --> 01:16:46.605
You thought I was
going to screw you over?

01:16:46.638 --> 01:16:47.973
No.

01:16:49.341 --> 01:16:51.076
I'm sorry.

01:16:51.109 --> 01:16:54.046
- Where are they now?
- Still at the bank.

01:16:54.079 --> 01:16:56.114
I just put them in another box.

01:16:57.616 --> 01:16:59.418
Jamie, that means
they're coming back.

01:16:59.451 --> 01:17:02.220
Oh, my God! Willow!

01:17:14.433 --> 01:17:16.234
Your fucking boyfriend
fucked us!

01:17:16.268 --> 01:17:18.637
Check the house.

01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:21.373
Son of a bitch.
The kid is loose!

01:17:21.406 --> 01:17:22.974
- Fucking kid is loose!
- Fuck!

01:17:49.935 --> 01:17:51.870
You see Chris, you kill him.

01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:56.575
We find the wife...
we get the bonds.

01:19:06.746 --> 01:19:08.480
Fucking cut me?

01:19:10.582 --> 01:19:12.050
I'm fucking bleeding!

01:19:14.486 --> 01:19:16.688
- Motherfucker.
- Where's Jamie?

01:19:16.722 --> 01:19:18.457
Shoot him. He cut me.

01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:20.760
- Where's Jamie?
- Shoot him!

01:19:20.793 --> 01:19:24.229
He cut me! Shoot him!
What are you waiting for?

01:19:24.262 --> 01:19:27.032
I said shoot him!
Shoot that motherfucker!

01:19:27.065 --> 01:19:28.433
You pussy!

01:19:28.467 --> 01:19:30.368
- Shoot him!
- Enough!

01:21:05.397 --> 01:21:08.166
<i>You want the fucking key?</i>

01:21:08.199 --> 01:21:09.200
<i>I've got it.</i>

01:21:09.769 --> 01:21:11.169
Come and get it.

01:22:21.974 --> 01:22:23.909
Chris.

01:22:27.245 --> 01:22:29.514
Time to kiss and make up?

01:22:31.683 --> 01:22:34.185
Or is it really too late for us?

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.895
Jamie!

01:25:37.736 --> 01:25:39.571
Willow!

01:26:06.932 --> 01:26:10.435
Okay... Let's get out of here.

01:26:15.908 --> 01:26:18.476
Chris...

01:26:23.716 --> 01:26:26.384
- Shut up.
- Chris.

01:26:27.987 --> 01:26:29.454
Margaret.

01:26:31.522 --> 01:26:32.557
What?

01:26:34.159 --> 01:26:35.693
Margaret.

01:26:39.031 --> 01:26:44.669
My... my real name...
is Margaret.
