IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.270 --> 00:05.773
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.806 --> 00:08.509
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.542 --> 00:10.378
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.411 --> 00:11.745
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.779 --> 00:13.781
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.016
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.522
>> [shivering, sniffling]

00:27.361 --> 00:30.364
[phone beeps]

00:31.665 --> 00:34.502
>> 9-1-1 OPERATOR 8-4-5.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.437
WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.506
>> A MAN BROKE
INTO MY APARTMENT.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.174
HE RAPED ME.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.209
>> DO YOU NEED AN AMBULANCE?

00:41.242 --> 00:43.744
>> NO.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.280
BUT HE DOES.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.786
>> OKAY, PAM, I NEED TO GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.588
>> IT LEAKS EVERY RAIN.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.490
I KEPT TELLING MY LANDLORD
IT WASN'T SAFE.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.759
>> THE SEAL WAS BROKEN.
HE SLIPPED THE PANE OUT.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.861
IT'S AN EASY ENOUGH DROP
TO THE FRIDGE

01:00.894 --> 01:03.297
AND THEN ONTO THE COUNTER.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.733
>> THEN ME.

01:05.766 --> 01:09.337
I GUESS THAT SELF-DEFENSE CLASS
AT THE Y FINALLY PAID OFF.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.872
>> UGH, FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY
PUT MY BALLS IN A WOOD CHIPPER.

01:11.905 --> 01:12.873
>> MM-HMM.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.508
>> UGH, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:14.542 --> 01:17.578
>> WELL, THAT DEFENSELESS
YOUNG LADY YOU TARGETED,

01:17.611 --> 01:19.347
NOT SO DEFENSELESS, RIGHT?

01:19.380 --> 01:20.648
>> I WAS TERRIFIED.

01:20.681 --> 01:25.419
WHEN I WOKE UP WITH HIM
ON TOP OF ME,

01:25.453 --> 01:27.455
ALL I--ALL I COULD DO
WAS SCREAM.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.522
>> WELL, SCREAMING'S GOOD.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.224
LOTS OF TIMES, THAT'S ENOUGH
TO SCARE THEM AWAY.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.692
>> NOT HIM.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.627
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:33.661 --> 01:35.196
>> AH, YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT
IN FIVE TO TEN.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.831
>> WAIT, AM I UNDER ARREST?

01:37.865 --> 01:38.766
>> LET ME GUESS.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.202
YOU HAVE NO MEMORY
OF RAPING PAM GALLIANO.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.603
>> NO, I REMEMBER THAT.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.405
>> HE SLAPPED HIS HAND
OVER MY MOUTH

01:44.438 --> 01:45.873
AND SAID, "NOT SO LOUD, PAM.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.242
YOU WANT SOMEONE
TO CALL THE POLICE?"

01:48.276 --> 01:49.577
I REMEMBERED MY INSTRUCTOR

01:49.610 --> 01:51.845
SAYING EYES, THROAT,
OR TESTICLES

01:51.879 --> 01:53.447
ARE ALWAYS WITHIN ARM'S REACH.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.916
BITE, KICK, SCRATCH,
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.352
>> I WANT HER ARRESTED
FOR ASSAULTING ME.

02:02.956 --> 02:03.857
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.459
>> WHAT DO YOU CALL
WHAT SHE DID TO ME?

02:05.493 --> 02:06.594
>> FOR A RAPIST?
OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.496
>> SHE WANTED ME TO!

02:08.529 --> 02:11.799
>> WHEN I KNOCKED OVER
THE LAMP, HE SAID,

02:11.832 --> 02:15.503
"YEAH, FIGHT ME, BITCH.
THAT'S SO HOT."

02:15.536 --> 02:17.505
>> HE NEEDED YOU TO RESIST
TO BECOME AROUSED.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.873
>> HE GRABBED MY ANKLE,
PULLED ME DOWN.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.743
I--I SAW THE--THE DUMBBELL
UNDER THE BED.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.878
>> I HEAR YOU GAVE HIM
A CONCUSSION.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.547
COME ON, LET'S GO.

02:26.580 --> 02:27.915
>> AND A FEW EXTRA KICKS
BETWEEN THE LEGS.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.183
>> COME ON.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.285
>> THAT WAS OKAY, RIGHT?
>> YEAH.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.454
>> YOU BROKE INTO HER APARTMENT
AND FORCED HER TO HAVE SEX.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.922
HOW DO YOU NOT
CALL THAT RAPE?

02:34.955 --> 02:36.524
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
LOOK IN MY PANTS,

02:36.557 --> 02:38.192
IN THE POCKET.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.528
I MET HER
ON A FANTASY RAPE SITE.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.862
[stammers]

02:41.895 --> 02:44.598
SHE SENT ME DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS.

02:44.632 --> 02:48.269
WHEN, WHERE, EXACTLY WHAT
SHE WANTED ME TO DO TO HER.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.872
SHE WANTED ME TO RAPE HER.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.490
>> "WHAM BAM PAM"--
THAT'S NOT MY SCREEN NAME.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.757
>> LOOK, I--
I BELIEVE YOU, PAM.

03:43.791 --> 03:44.825
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

03:44.858 --> 03:45.659
THAT THE MAN WHO ATTACKED YOU
HAS YOUR ADDRESS,

03:45.693 --> 03:46.994
HE HAS DETAILS
ABOUT YOUR SKYLIGHT.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.929
>> I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THERE WERE FANTASY RAPE SITES.

03:48.962 --> 03:49.963
I'VE CERTAINLY NEVER BEEN
ON ONE.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.965
>> WE'RE GETTING A WARRANT
FOR OWEN'S COMPUTER.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.934
>> YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING
ON MINE.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.869
>> DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.805
>> NO. WHY?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.973
>> COME LOOK AT THIS.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.576
>> OH, GOD!
THAT'S GOT TO BE PHOTOSHOPPED.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.911
>> MA'AM, YOU CAN'T TAMPER
WITH THE EVIDENCE.

04:03.944 --> 04:04.745
[computer beeping]

04:04.778 --> 04:05.813
>> HOW DID THIS GET
ON MY COMPUTER?

04:05.846 --> 04:08.616
>> THEY'RE NOT POP-UPS.
SOMEBODY DOWNLOADED THEM.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.384
>> I DON'T WATCH PORN.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.719
>> WELL, IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.054
>> THIS ONE IS.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.425
POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY
IS A FELONY.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.994
>> I SWEAR, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THIS CAME FROM.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.963
>> OWEN AND PAM BOTH SAY
THE OTHER ONE SET THEM UP.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.933
>> SO WHO'S SKETCHIER,
OUR VICTIM OR THE PERP?

04:25.966 --> 04:28.836
>> WELL, JUDGING
BY LOOKS ALONE,

04:28.869 --> 04:30.404
GUILTY.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.972
OWEN FREELY ADMITS
THAT HE TROLLS

04:32.005 --> 04:33.607
FANTASY RAPE WEBSITES.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.975
>> PAM SAYS SHE'S NOT A MEMBER,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.411
BUT HER PORN STASH
SAYS DIFFERENT.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.579
>> HER COMPUTER LIED.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.748
I FOUND A TROJAN HORSE IN IT.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.983
>> MEANING SOMEONE DOWNLOADED
THE PORN REMOTELY.

04:43.016 --> 04:43.851
>> YEAH, THROUGH
A CYBER BACKDOOR.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.853
>> CAN YOU PROVE IT WAS
OWEN WALTERS?

04:45.886 --> 04:46.954
>> I DON'T THINK IT WAS.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.422
THERE WAS NO SPYWARE
ON HIS COMPUTER.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.923
>> ARE YOU SAYING
THERE'S A SECOND RAPIST?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.326
>> BRING ME A COMPUTER.
I'LL CONFIRM IT.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.662
>> SO OWEN READ
THE "HEY, BIG BOY,

04:54.695 --> 04:56.497
COME UP
AND RAPE ME SOMETIME" POST

04:56.530 --> 04:57.898
AND WAS DUMB ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE IT.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.333
>> WELL, IF THAT'S HOW
IT PLAYED OUT,

04:59.367 --> 05:00.734
SHOULD WE VOID HIS ARREST?

05:00.768 --> 05:01.835
>> WHY?
IT'S STILL RAPE.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.371
>> SHE SAID NO,
AND HE DIDN'T STOP.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.738
>> HE DIDN'T KNOW TO.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.073
IN FANTASY RAPE'S
TWISTED LEXICON,

05:06.106 --> 05:08.008
NO ACTUALLY DOES MEAN YES.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.978
>> IN SEX CRIMES,
NO MEANS FELONY RAPE.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.946
SO IF OWEN
ISN'T THE MASTERMIND

05:12.980 --> 05:14.848
AND PAM WASN'T
A WILLING PARTICIPANT,

05:14.882 --> 05:17.651
WHO SET HER UP
TO BE RAPED?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.720
>> IT MUST'VE BEEN MY CRAZY EX,
TYLER BRUNSON.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.888
HE'S A COMPUTER CONSULTANT.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.523
>> WHEN DID YOU BREAK UP?

05:22.556 --> 05:23.857
>> TWO YEARS AGO.
HEY, WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.626
YOU THINK HE'D MAKE
A GOOD GUARD DOG?

05:25.659 --> 05:26.927
HE DOESN'T LOOK VERY FEROCIOUS.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.829
>> I THINK HE'D PROTECT YOU
JUST FINE.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.031
IT'S ACTUALLY THE BARKING
THAT DETERS THE BREAK-IN.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.099
BUT TELL US ABOUT YOUR EX.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.834
>> WELL, AFTER I DUMPED HIM,

05:33.867 --> 05:36.537
HE'D CALL, E-MAIL,
TEXT 24/7.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.539
I'D CHANGE MY NUMBER.
SOMEHOW HE'D FIND THE NEW ONE.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.441
HE'D SHOW UP AT MY HOUSE,
MY WORK.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.875
STALKED ME
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

05:41.909 --> 05:42.876
>> HOLD ON.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.845
SO YOU BROKE UP
TWO YEARS AGO,

05:44.878 --> 05:46.814
AND HE HASN'T BOTHERED YOU
IN SIX MONTHS?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.683
>> THAT'S WHEN I MOVED HERE
FROM RHODE ISLAND.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.752
I LEFT MY FRIENDS,
MY FAMILY,

05:51.785 --> 05:55.989
A REALLY GOOD JOB--
MY WHOLE LIFE.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.959
HE TRACKED ME DOWN.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.429
I--I CAN'T AFFORD
TO MOVE AGAIN.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.431
>> I UNDERSTAND.
IS HE STILL IN RHODE ISLAND?

06:03.464 --> 06:04.898
>> YOU DON'T GET IT.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.900
HE KNOWS THE DETAILS
OF MY APARTMENT.

06:06.934 --> 06:10.137
HE MUST'VE BEEN INSIDE.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.639
THAT MEANS HE'S HERE.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.507
>> AND IF HE IS,
WE'RE GONNA FIND HIM.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.812
ORCHESTRATING A RAPE,

06:18.846 --> 06:20.881
DISSEMINATING CHILD PORNOGRAPHY,
STALKING.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.616
THIS GUY'S AN SVU TRIFECTA.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.551
>> ASSUMING IT WAS TYLER.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.952
IF HE SET HER UP ONLINE
FROM RHODE ISLAND,

06:24.985 --> 06:25.953
IT BELONGS TO THE FEDS.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.455
>> UNLESS HE FOLLOWED HER HERE.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.756
>> YOU ARE CORRECT,
OH, WISE ONE.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.158
TYLER STILL HAS A VALID LICENSE
IN RHODE ISLAND,

06:31.191 --> 06:32.826
WHERE HE'S REGISTERED TO VOTE.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.595
>> THAT'S A THREE-HOUR DRIVE
FROM HERE.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.563
>> WELL, WHY COMMUTE

06:35.596 --> 06:37.998
WHEN YOU CAN STALK UP CLOSE
AND PERSONAL?

06:38.031 --> 06:39.900
I CALLED CON EDISON.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.602
AND GUESS WHO GOT
THE UTILITIES TURNED ON

06:41.635 --> 06:43.103
IN THEIR NEW DIGS
IN MANHATTAN LAST MONTH?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.905
>> TYLER BRUNSON.
>> RIGHT.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.940
OF ALL THE APARTMENTS
IN ALL OF MANHATTAN,

06:46.974 --> 06:48.776
WHY WOULD TYLER CHOOSE
THIS ONE?

06:48.809 --> 06:50.611
THIS IS TYLER'S BUILDING.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.581
[computer clicks and beeps]

06:53.614 --> 06:56.984
AND OVER HERE...
THIS IS PAM'S.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.119
>> SON OF A BITCH IS RIGHT
ACROSS THE STREET.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.588
>> BUT WE STILL
NEED A WARRANT.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.055
>> I KNOW.
SOMEBODY GET CABOT ON IT.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.925
I GOT TO GIVE PAM
THE HEADS-UP.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.229
>> HE'S BEEN WATCHING ME?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.898
I'M LOCKED IN A LEASE HERE.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.766
MY SAVINGS ARE GONE.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.935
IF I GO TO RHODE ISLAND,
HE'LL JUST FOLLOW ME THERE.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.937
>> LOOK, PAM,
WE'RE GOING TO GET HIM.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.071
>> HOW?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.040
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT WAS
JUST TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER?

07:20.073 --> 07:23.977
HE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.112
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.715
WE NEVER GOT ALONG.

07:27.748 --> 07:28.949
HE HAD MAJOR
ABANDONMENT ISSUES...

07:28.982 --> 07:30.518
AND DADDY ISSUES
AND CONTROL ISSUES

07:30.551 --> 07:31.585
AND ANGER ISSUES.

07:31.619 --> 07:33.153
>> DID HE EVER
PHYSICALLY HURT YOU?

07:33.186 --> 07:35.055
>> I WISH HE HAD.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.025
EVERY TIME HE'D BREAK
THE RESTRAINING ORDER,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.994
HE'D CONVINCE THE JUDGE
IT WAS A HUGE COINCIDENCE

07:41.028 --> 07:42.696
HE'D SHOWN UP
AT THE SAME RESTAURANT--

07:42.730 --> 07:44.932
>> PAM, WE'RE GOING
TO STOP HIM.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.567
>> BUT YOU CAN'T.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.901
NO ONE CAN.

07:47.935 --> 07:51.238
HE'S NEVER GONNA
LEAVE ME ALONE...

07:51.271 --> 07:53.941
NOT UNTIL ONE OF US IS...

07:53.974 --> 07:55.208
DEAD.

07:55.242 --> 07:56.343
[dog whimpers]

07:56.376 --> 07:59.747
>> THE RESTRAINING ORDER
THAT YOU HAD IN RHODE ISLAND,

07:59.780 --> 08:01.181
IS THAT STILL IN EFFECT?

08:01.214 --> 08:03.216
>> I DON'T KNOW.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.587
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE
MY ADDRESS IF I MOVED

08:06.620 --> 08:09.056
SO HE'D KNOW
WHERE TO STAY AWAY FROM.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.659
KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE
OF RUNNING AWAY.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.294
>> SO WE'LL GET YOU
ANOTHER ONE.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.629
HERE.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.133
>> ALEX.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.836
>> JUDGE KOEHLER,
HOW ARE YOU?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.672
>> A LOT BETTER
THAN POOR OLD ALAN.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.707
EMERGENCY GALLBLADDER SURGERY.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.075
>> OH.
>> ANYTHING I CAN DO?

08:28.108 --> 08:30.844
>> UH, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE TRYING A CASE.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.180
>> WE'RE ON A 15-MINUTE RECESS.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.048
WALK WITH ME.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.184
>> I HAVE TWO APPLICATIONS--
>> I SEE THAT.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.786
BUSY SATURDAY?

08:38.819 --> 08:40.153
>> UH, KIND OF.
WHY?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.689
>> I'M TEACHING A CIVICS CLASS

08:41.722 --> 08:43.156
AT THE JUVENILE
DETENTION CENTER.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.157
>> OF COURSE YOU ARE.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.159
>> AND I NEED
A GUEST SPEAKER.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.929
>> OH.
ABSOLUTELY.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.164
MY WARRANT?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.868
>> QUID QUO PRO?

08:54.902 --> 08:57.037
CAREFUL, COUNSELOR.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.171
I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THIS.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.106
>> THIS WOMAN IS AFRAID
FOR HER LIFE.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.208
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

09:01.241 --> 09:04.778
>> NEVER ONCE IN 30 YEARS

09:04.812 --> 09:06.747
HAVE I ALLOWED
MY SON'S MURDER

09:06.780 --> 09:09.082
TO SWAY A RULING
OR DENY A MAN DUE PROCESS.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.851
THE DAY THAT HAPPENS,

09:10.884 --> 09:12.152
I WALK AWAY FROM THE BENCH.

09:12.185 --> 09:15.656
>> I KNOW THAT.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.758
THERE IS AN EXISTING
RESTRAINING ORDER

09:17.791 --> 09:19.893
IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
THAT IS STILL IN EFFECT.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.361
TYLER BRUNSON VIOLATED IT

09:21.394 --> 09:23.964
WHEN HE MOVED RIGHT ACROSS
THE STREET FROM THE VICTIM.

09:23.997 --> 09:27.200
>> I CAN'T REQUIRE HIM TO MOVE.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.736
[sighs]

09:28.769 --> 09:30.704
BUT I WILL GRANT
A TEMPORARY ORDER OF PROTECTION,

09:30.738 --> 09:33.974
WHICH HE HAS THE RIGHT
TO APPEAL.

09:34.007 --> 09:37.044
SEE YOU SATURDAY.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.715
>> YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.784
PAM LIVES HERE IN MANHATTAN?

09:43.817 --> 09:46.019
>> YOU HAVE TROUBLE LETTING
THINGS GO, DON'T YOU, TYLER?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.155
>> LOOK,
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT--

09:48.188 --> 09:50.924
WHAT PAM TOLD YOU,
BUT I DUMPED HER.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.661
>> THEN WHY IS SHE THE ONE
WITH THE RESTRAINING ORDER?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.629
>> SHE COULDN'T TAKE
THE REJECTION,

09:55.663 --> 09:58.298
HAD SOME KIND
OF PSYCHOTIC BREAKDOWN.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.400
LIED THROUGH HER TEETH
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

10:00.433 --> 10:02.169
I WAS THE STALKER.
>> REALLY?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.905
THEN WHY DID YOU
FOLLOW HER HERE?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.707
>> I FOLLOWED THE WORK.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.742
IT DRIED UP BACK HOME.

10:08.776 --> 10:12.012
I--I LANDED A FAT CIVILIAN
CONTRACT WITH THE D.O.D.,

10:12.045 --> 10:13.180
COMPUTER TRAINING.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.181
>> AND IT'S JUST A FLUKE
THAT YOU WOUND UP

10:14.214 --> 10:16.984
MOVING RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
FROM YOUR EX.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.187
>> STRANGER THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.288
>> NAME ONE.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.823
>> WE NEED TO LOOK
AT YOUR COMPUTER.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.224
>> WHATEVER YOU NEED.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.761
>> "UNCLASSIFIED."
YOU GOT ONE THAT'S CLASSIFIED?

10:27.795 --> 10:28.829
>> WOULDN'T WANT TO GET THEM
MIXED UP.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.097
>> WE'LL NEED THAT ONE TOO.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.800
>> IT CONTAINS
PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.202
I HAVE TOP SECRET CLEARANCE.
DO YOU?

10:35.235 --> 10:36.937
>> WE CAN GET IT.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.106
>> GOOD LUCK.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.975
THIRD FLOOR, HUH?

10:42.009 --> 10:44.011
FREAKY.

10:44.044 --> 10:47.014
>> I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.149
GET YOURSELF SOME COUNSELING.

10:49.182 --> 10:52.219
HYPNOTISM, ACUPUNCTURE,
SOMETHING.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.688
AND MOVE ON.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.724
AND DO AS THE PAPER TELLS YOU.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.391
DON'T BOTHER HER AGAIN.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.962
>> [scoffs]

11:01.995 --> 11:04.865
>> FINE, I'LL HAVE MY SUPERIORS
CALL YOUR SUPERIORS.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.333
BAD NEWS, GUYS.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.168
TYLER'S D.O.D. JOB IS LEGIT.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.237
HE'S GOT A LAPTOP THAT DOESN'T
LEAVE THE DEPARTMENT.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.438
>> HOW DO WE GET TO IT?

11:11.471 --> 11:13.340
>> WELL, THEY DON'T WANT IT
GOTTEN TO.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.976
THEY SAY IT'S MATTERS
OF "NATIONAL SECURITY."

11:16.009 --> 11:18.178
>> BENSON.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.313
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THE HOSPITAL?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.182
RIGHT.
I'M ON MY WAY.

11:25.252 --> 11:26.219
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

11:26.253 --> 11:28.288
>> I RAN HOME ON MY LUNCH BREAK
TO WALK BABY,

11:28.321 --> 11:30.423
AND I TURNED A CORNER
AND RAN RIGHT INTO TYLER.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.059
>> WHAT DID HE DO?

11:32.092 --> 11:33.961
>> HE TRIED TO HUG ME.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.029
I PUSHED PAST HIM.
HE GRABBED MY THROAT.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.165
HE SAID, "DON'T YOU DARE
IGNORE ME.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.733
"Y-YOU THINK RAPE WAS BAD?

11:39.767 --> 11:41.301
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING."

11:41.334 --> 11:43.103
I TRIED TO SCREAM,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.238
BUT HE WAS SQUEEZING SO TIGHT,
NOTHING CAME OUT.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.774
>> PAM, HOW DID YOU GET AWAY?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.275
>> OH, GOD.

11:48.308 --> 11:50.878
BABY KEPT BARKING.
STAYED RIGHT BY MY SIDE.

11:50.911 --> 11:56.116
I SAW HIM BITING
AT TYLER'S PANT LEG.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.987
BROKE THREE RIBS,
BUT BABY WOULDN'T LET GO,

12:00.020 --> 12:03.190
NO MATTER HOW HARD
TYLER KICKED HIM...

12:03.223 --> 12:07.227
NOT TILL THE BASTARD
LET ME GO.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.868
>> NOW, WHAT PART OF
"STAY 500 FEET AWAY FROM HER"

12:14.902 --> 12:16.136
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.871
>> I WAS WALKING TO THE STORE.

12:17.905 --> 12:18.906
WE BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.073
>> OH, I'LL SAY.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.775
YOUR FOOT BUMPED
INTO HER DOG REPEATEDLY.

12:21.809 --> 12:26.246
>> THAT MANGY SEWER RAT
ATTACKED ME.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.848
>> MR. BRUNSON--
>> LOOK AT THIS.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.516
PANTS RUINED.
>> CALM DOWN, MR. BRUNSON.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.318
>> AND LOOK AT THIS.
BITE MARKS.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.285
HUH?

12:32.319 --> 12:33.453
I SHOULD BE IN THE HOSPITAL
GETTING CHECKED

12:33.486 --> 12:34.421
FOR--FOR RABIES!

12:34.454 --> 12:38.158
>> I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
YOU GAVE THE DOG RABIES.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.560
>> I WAS DEFENDING MYSELF...

12:40.593 --> 12:43.196
AGAINST BOTH
OF THOSE BITCHES.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.497
>> SO NOW PAM IS A BITCH
BECAUSE YOU RAN INTO HER

12:44.531 --> 12:48.268
ON THE STREET
AND YOU LOST CONTROL?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.436
>> I DON'T LOSE CONTROL.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.939
>> YOU DON'T LIKE TO LOSE,
PERIOD.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.875
YOUR PAST EMPLOYER
IMMERSHED ENTERPRISES

12:54.908 --> 12:56.877
WASN'T PLANNING ON RENEWING
YOUR CONTRACT

12:56.910 --> 12:59.880
A FEW YEARS BACK,
SO YOU HAD A SLIP AND FALL.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.581
ONE FAT WORKERS' COMP CLAIM.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.817
>> I HAVE PERSISTENT BACK PAIN.

13:03.851 --> 13:07.054
>> WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN OBSESSIVE
NEED FOR PAYBACK

13:07.087 --> 13:08.956
TO ANYONE WHO REJECTS YOU.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.390
>> NOW, YOU TOOK
THAT PHOTO OF PAM

13:10.423 --> 13:12.960
WHILE YOU WERE STILL TOGETHER,
EXCEPT SHE WAS DRESSED,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.162
AND YOU PHOTOSHOPPED
THAT PORNO POSE.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.497
>> SEE, WE HAD IT ENHANCED.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.431
PAM RECOGNIZED YOUR BEDROOM,

13:18.465 --> 13:21.501
SO WE SENT IT TO PROVIDENCE PD
TO VERIFY.

13:21.534 --> 13:25.505
IT'LL BE BACK
ANY MINUTE NOW.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.175
THE ANTICIPATION'S KILLING ME.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.345
>> YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WE GOT
ANYTHING OFF THE ENHANCEMENT.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.446
>> WE DIDN'T.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.514
>> LISTEN TO ME.

13:34.547 --> 13:38.018
NOW, YOU HAVE WASTED
ENOUGH YEARS ON THIS WOMAN.

13:38.051 --> 13:42.355
YOU COME CLEAN
BEFORE THE PHOTO GETS BACK HERE,

13:42.389 --> 13:44.892
I'LL TALK TO THE D.A. FOR YOU.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.060
>> THERE'S NO WAY HE'S
GONNA FALL FOR THIS.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.363
>> SHE...CONNED ME

13:50.397 --> 13:55.368
INTO BELIEVING SHE LOVED ME.

13:55.402 --> 14:00.140
I WAS GONNA MARRY HER.

14:00.173 --> 14:04.477
WELL...THIS TIME I'M DONE.

14:04.511 --> 14:08.648
I SWEAR.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.350
WE'RE EVEN NOW.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.519
>> NOT BY A LONG SHOT, BUDDY.

14:12.552 --> 14:15.322
>> GOD, I LOVE THE DUMB ONES.

14:18.591 --> 14:21.494
>> MOTION TO DISMISS REQUEST
FOR A MATT DUNAWAY HEARING.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.562
REQUEST FOR A HUNTLEY HEARING.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.997
>> HUNTLEY?
PLEASE.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.565
DON'T TELL ME.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.634
SOMEONE NEGLECTED TO ADVISE
MR. BRUNSON

14:27.667 --> 14:29.903
OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.471
>> THE DEFENDANT
WAS PROPERLY MIRANDIZED.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.906
HE FREELY WAIVED HIS RIGHT
TO COUNSEL--

14:32.940 --> 14:34.274
>> WHEREUPON STATEMENTS
WERE COERCED

14:34.307 --> 14:35.542
BY DETECTIVES BENSON
AND STABLER

14:35.575 --> 14:37.244
BY FEEDING HIM A LOAD
OF MALARKEY

14:37.277 --> 14:38.511
ABOUT SOME NONEXISTENT
ENHANCED PHOTOGRAPHS.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.013
>> DECEPTION ON THE PART
OF THE POLICE

14:40.047 --> 14:41.548
HAS CONSTANTLY BEEN UPHELD
DURING INTERROGATION.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.083
PEOPLE V. JACKSON.
PEOPLE V. BALDWIN.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.251
>> THEY CAN DECEIVE.
THEY CANNOT COERCE.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.486
A CONFESSION
IS NOT CONSIDERED VOLUNTARY

14:46.519 --> 14:48.688
WHEN INDUCED BY FALSE PROMISES
OF LENIENCY.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.691
>> WHAT ENTICEMENTS WERE DANGLED
IN FRONT OF MR. BRUNSON?

14:51.724 --> 14:52.692
>> NONE.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.561
>> "IF THE GOVERNMENT BECOMES
A LAW BREAKER,

14:54.594 --> 14:56.296
IT BREEDS CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW."

14:56.329 --> 14:57.597
CLARENCE DARROW.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.666
>> THAT'S BRANDEIS,
MR. HOROWITZ.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.034
>> OH.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.103
>> SOME STATES REQUIRE
ALL INTERROGATIONS

15:03.136 --> 15:04.571
TO BE VIDEOTAPED.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.573
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE'RE SO RESISTANT TO THAT HERE.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.640
>> I WAS PRESENT, YOUR HONOR.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.577
NO TERMS OF LENIENCY
WERE EVER PUT ON THE TABLE.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.412
>> DETECTIVE STABLER
ASSURED MY CLIENT

15:12.445 --> 15:14.347
HE'D GET CONSIDERATION
FROM THE D.A.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.582
>> THE DEFENDANT
INCORRECTLY INFERRED

15:15.615 --> 15:17.284
THAT I WOULD NOT PROSECUTE.
>> THAT'S A LOAD OF BULL CRAP

15:17.317 --> 15:18.285
AND YOU KNOW IT!

15:18.318 --> 15:20.653
>> A LITTLE CIVILITY.
THANK YOU, COUNSELORS.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.655
>> MS. CABOT,

15:22.689 --> 15:23.656
DUE PROCESS
SHOULD ALWAYS BE SUBJECT

15:23.690 --> 15:25.125
TO RIGOROUS SPOT CHECKING.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.561
I'M INCLINED TO GRANT
HIS HUNTLEY HEARING.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.533
>> DETECTIVE STABLER,
DO YOU RECALL

15:33.566 --> 15:35.635
MR. BRUNSON REQUESTING
MEDICAL ATTENTION

15:35.668 --> 15:36.569
WHILE IN YOUR CUSTODY?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.271
>> YOU MEAN FOR THE SCRATCH
ON HIS LEG.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.273
>> FOR THE VICIOUS DOG BITE.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.209
ISN'T IT STANDARD PROCEDURE
TO SUSPEND QUESTIONING

15:42.242 --> 15:45.412
UNTIL A SUSPECT'S MEDICAL NEEDS
ARE ATTENDED TO?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.679
>> THE SKIN WASN'T EVEN BROKEN.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.715
>> HE CONVEYED TO YOU
A GREAT DEAL OF DISTRESS

15:48.748 --> 15:49.682
OVER THIS WOUND.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.484
>> HE WAS MORE UPSET
ABOUT HIS TORN PANTS.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.020
I DIDN'T RUN OUT AND GET HIM
A TAILOR EITHER.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.622
>> SAVE THE JOKES
FOR OPEN MIC NIGHT, DETECTIVE.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.457
>> YOUR HONOR,
AS FAR AS I'M AWARE,

15:57.490 --> 15:58.658
THE DEFENDANT
NEVER SOUGHT TREATMENT

15:58.691 --> 16:02.529
FOR THIS ALLEGED WOUND,
EVEN AFTER BAIL,

16:02.562 --> 16:04.431
SO I FAIL TO SEE THE POINT
IN THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.700
>> MR. BRUNSON,
DID YOU SEE A DOCTOR?

16:07.734 --> 16:08.701
MR. BRUNSON,

16:08.735 --> 16:10.670
THE COURT'S ADDRESSING YOU.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.606
>> I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF PARTICIPATING

16:13.640 --> 16:15.408
IN THIS TRAVESTY.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.609
>> WELL, THAT'S A GREAT SHAME,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.245
BECAUSE IN NO OTHER COUNTRY
ON EARTH

16:18.278 --> 16:19.712
IS YOUR PRESUMPTION
OF INNOCENCE

16:19.746 --> 16:21.348
SO VEHEMENTLY GUARANTEED

16:21.381 --> 16:24.551
OR ARE YOU GRANTED THE SCOPE
TO AID IN YOUR OWN DEFENSE.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.587
>> YOUR HONOR,
I WAS MOVING ON, ANYWAY.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.289
DETECTIVE STABLER,

16:29.322 --> 16:31.191
DO YOU RECALL TELLING
MR. BRUNSON

16:31.224 --> 16:32.592
"YOU'VE WASTED ENOUGH YEARS
OF YOUR LIFE

16:32.625 --> 16:33.593
ON PAM GALLIANO"?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.695
>> WORDS TO THAT EFFECT, YES.

16:35.728 --> 16:36.663
>> INTENDING HIM TO BELIEVE

16:36.696 --> 16:39.199
THAT IF HE TOLD YOU
WHAT YOU WANTED TO HEAR,

16:39.232 --> 16:40.567
ALL THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM
WOULD BE DROPPED.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.236
>> NO, MEANING HE SHOULD TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY

16:43.270 --> 16:45.605
FOR HIS ACTIONS,
PAY HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY,

16:45.638 --> 16:46.806
AND MOVE ON.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.109
>> GOING SOMEWHERE,
MR. BRUNSON?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.143
THIS IS NOT A TEA PARTY.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.678
ATTENDANCE IS NOT OPTIONAL.

16:51.711 --> 16:52.679
>> A BRIEF RECESS, YOUR HONOR.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.447
>> I AM NOT GOING
TO SIT HERE

16:54.481 --> 16:56.816
AND BE INSULTED.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.318
THIS--THIS IS A JOKE.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.686
>> COURT OFFICER,
RESTRAIN THAT MAN.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.588
DETECTIVE STABLER,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.323
NO ONE HAS DISMISSED YOU
FROM THE STAND.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.624
[hurried footsteps]

17:04.657 --> 17:07.194
>> WHERE YOU GOING, TYLER?

17:07.227 --> 17:08.261
THE HEARING CAN'T BE OVER.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.796
I HAVEN'T EVEN TESTIFIED.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.134
>> YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAST ME.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.568
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.337
>> AH!
[struggling]

17:17.370 --> 17:19.339
>> THANKS, GUYS.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.373
YOU JUST SAVED ME TEN BUCKS.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.674
>> GET OFF ME!

17:21.708 --> 17:24.611
>> IT'S NOT MUCH FUN BEING
HUNTED DOWN, IS IT?

17:24.644 --> 17:25.678
>> [whimpers]

17:25.712 --> 17:26.813
>> THE PEOPLE REQUEST
THE DEFENDANT BE REMANDED

17:26.846 --> 17:28.148
UNTIL TRIAL.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.549
MR. BRUNSON VIOLATED
HIS BAIL AGREEMENT

17:29.582 --> 17:30.550
BY FLEEING YOUR COURTROOM.

17:30.583 --> 17:31.651
>> MR. BRUNSON WAS OVERWROUGHT.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.620
HE'S NEW TO THE CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.255
>> HARDLY--HE HAS
A RESTRAINING ORDER

17:35.288 --> 17:37.290
IN THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND
AND AN ORDER OF PROTECTION--

17:37.324 --> 17:38.658
>> IT WOULD BE SO NICE
IF THE TWO OF YOU

17:38.691 --> 17:41.861
COULD OBSERVE THE RULES
OF COURTROOM ETIQUETTE

17:41.894 --> 17:43.463
AND SPEAK IN TURN.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.731
>> I'M SORRY.
>> APOLOGIZE.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.433
>> I'M READY TO MAKE
MY RULING.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.835
GIVEN THE TOTALITY
OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

17:48.868 --> 17:50.470
THE COURT BELIEVES
IT IS UNLIKELY

17:50.503 --> 17:51.804
THAT THE DEFENDANT WILL RETURN
TO THE COURT

17:51.838 --> 17:53.506
OF HIS OWN VOLITION.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.176
I AM THEREFORE REVOKING BAIL
AND ORDERING HIM REMANDED.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.644
>> WHAT?

17:57.677 --> 17:58.845
>> JIMMY, TAKE HIM
INTO CUSTODY.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.647
>> YOU CAN'T DO THI--
I--I HAVE RIGHTS.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.515
>> YOU CAN HAVE A TOOTHBRUSH.
>> IT'S OKAY, TYLER.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.751
I CAN APPEAL--
>> YOU CORRUPT PIECE OF GARBAGE!

18:04.784 --> 18:07.787
>> SON, DURING THE PERIOD
OF YOUR INCARCERATION,

18:07.820 --> 18:10.757
I SINCERELY URGE YOU
TO DO SOME SOUL SEARCHING.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.859
CONSIDER HOW YOUR CONDUCT
WILL APPEAR TO THE JURY.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.727
>> CONSIDER YOURS.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.465
A TYRANT WILL ALWAYS FIND
A PRETEXT FOR HIS TYRANNY!

18:18.498 --> 18:21.301
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

18:21.334 --> 18:22.669
>> HOW MUCH DID PAM PAY YOU
TO PERSECUTE ME?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.137
OR--OR DID YOU TAKE IT OUT
IN TRADE?

18:24.171 --> 18:26.706
HOW WAS SHE?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.408
HOW WAS THE CHEAP WHORE?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.876
HUH?

18:29.909 --> 18:31.478
>> CAPTAIN,
I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN

18:31.511 --> 18:32.579
WITH MY GIRL THIS WEEKEND.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.480
I'D LOVE TO GET A JUMP
ON TRAFFIC--

18:33.513 --> 18:35.282
>> MUCH AS I HATE
TO STAND IN THE WAY

18:35.315 --> 18:37.217
OF YOUNG LOVE,
WE'RE SHORT-HANDED TOMORROW.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.519
LIV AND ELLIOT ARE BOTH
ON CALL FOR COURT.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.388
>> SPECIAL VICTIMS.
DETECTIVE STABLER.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.455
>> LIV, IS THERE
ANY CHANCE THERE'D BE

18:42.489 --> 18:44.557
AN 11th HOUR PLEAD-OUT
ON THE PAM GALLIANO RAPE?

18:44.591 --> 18:45.825
>> I HOPE NOT, MUNCH.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.627
DO YOU KNOW THAT NEARLY
3 1/2 MILLION PEOPLE

18:47.660 --> 18:48.928
ARE VICTIMS OF STALKING?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.563
IT'S ALMOST NEVER PROSECUTED

18:50.597 --> 18:51.831
UNLESS IS ESCALATES
TO VIOLENCE.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.600
TRIALS ARE THE ONLY WAY

18:53.633 --> 18:55.268
THAT THIS ISSUE GETS
ANY ATTENTION.

18:55.302 --> 18:59.172
>> NO, NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER, SIR.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.274
WHAT DID I DO NOW?

19:01.308 --> 19:03.310
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:03.343 --> 19:05.845
>> I DON'T KNOW.
THAT WAS JUDGE KOEHLER.

19:05.878 --> 19:06.913
NOT HIS CLERK, HIM.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.881
HE WANTS ME TO STOP BY.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.553
[knock at door]

19:13.586 --> 19:14.954
YOUR HONOR.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.923
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.892
>> AFTER YOUR TESTIMONY
LAST WEEK,

19:19.926 --> 19:20.827
I PULLED YOUR JACKET.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.662
>> YOU RULED MY INTERROGATION
WAS CLEAN.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.431
>> IT WAS.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.400
BUT I SEE THAT YOU HAVE
CROSSED THE LINE IN THE PAST.

19:27.434 --> 19:30.637
CIVILIAN COMPLAINTS,
EXCESSIVE FORCE CLAIMS,

19:30.670 --> 19:31.738
OFFICIAL REPRIMANDS.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.607
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR...

19:34.641 --> 19:36.743
THOSE WERE SITUATIONS
WHERE I HAD TO MAKE DECISIONS,

19:36.776 --> 19:38.177
AND I MADE THEM.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.616
>> WHEN WISER MEN
THAN YOU OR I

19:43.650 --> 19:46.853
SET UP OUR SYSTEM
OF RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS,

19:46.886 --> 19:48.988
THEY GAVE THEM TO ALL MEN.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.359
NOT JUST
ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.793
>> ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME
I'M A LIABILITY

19:53.826 --> 19:56.329
TO THE BRUNSON TRIAL?
>> NO.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.598
I'M TRYING TO HIRE YOU.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.667
>> FOR WHAT?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.770
>> TAKE A SEAT.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.878
30 YEARS AGO, MY WIFE
AND I TOOK OUR SON MARSHALL,

20:11.911 --> 20:16.449
THREE--THREE-YEAR-OLD,
ON A PICNIC.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.817
WHILE SHAWNA
WAS HELPING ME PROOFREAD

20:17.850 --> 20:19.552
MY FIRST BOOK
ON LEGAL ETHICS,

20:19.586 --> 20:22.389
MARSHALL RAN OFF TO PLAY
WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.925
WE NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.295
>> HIS KILLER
WAS ROY LEE DOTSON.

20:28.328 --> 20:31.931
I REMEMBER
WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.402
>> SEVEN YEARS LATER,
DISPOSING OF HIS 12th VICTIM.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.004
MY SON WAS HIS FOURTH.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.872
THIS IS BEFORE DNA.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.342
AND NO ONE HAD MADE OUT
THE PATTERN.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.444
>> AND HE WAS
A LONG-HAUL TRUCKER, SO...

20:44.477 --> 20:45.678
>> BY THE TIME THEY CAUGHT HIM,

20:45.712 --> 20:48.448
HE WAS PRIMED TO POP...

20:48.481 --> 20:51.050
EVERY VICTIM...

20:51.083 --> 20:53.686
EVERY DEPRAVED ACT.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.622
HE SPARED NO GRUESOME DETAIL,

20:55.655 --> 20:57.590
EXCEPT THEIR LOCATIONS.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.393
>> HE HELD ON TO THAT
FOR HIS RAINY-DAY FUND.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.428
>> EVERY FEW YEARS,

21:01.461 --> 21:05.365
ONE...LUCKY COUPLE

21:05.398 --> 21:07.767
WOULD BE LED
TO THEIR CHILD'S REMAINS...

21:07.800 --> 21:13.039
IN EXCHANGE
FOR A FEW CREATURE COMFORTS.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.745
>> AND YOU'RE STILL WAITING
FOR YOUR TURN.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.850
>> HMM.
I'M THE LAST ONE.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.018
IN LIGHT OF HIS
12 LIFE SENTENCES,

21:26.052 --> 21:29.556
IT APPEARS HE HAS A PREJUDICE
AGAINST JUDGES.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.964
>> [sighs]

21:40.967 --> 21:43.770
I'LL GET IT OUT OF HIM.

21:43.803 --> 21:48.040
>> DETECTIVE...

21:48.074 --> 21:50.710
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BREAK
THE RULE OF LAW.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.612
>> WHERE IS HE?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.514
>> OSSINING...

21:54.547 --> 21:58.084
DYING OF EMPHYSEMA.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.953
I CAN'T GO TO MY GRAVE
WITHOUT BURYING MY SON.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.056
>> I UNDERSTAND.

22:14.501 --> 22:15.702
>> ALL RISE.

22:15.735 --> 22:19.105
NEW YORK SUPREME COURT
IS NOW IN SESSION.

22:19.138 --> 22:22.675
THE HONORABLE JUDGE
JOSHUA KOEHLER PRESIDING.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.644
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK

22:24.677 --> 22:26.513
VERSUS TYLER BRUNSON.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.949
INDICTMENT NUMBER 523109.

22:29.982 --> 22:33.920
>> BE SEATED.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.456
IN THE WORDS
OF THOMAS JEFFERSON,

22:36.489 --> 22:37.990
"I CONSIDER TRIAL BY JURY

22:38.024 --> 22:39.992
"TO BE THE GREATEST ANCHOR
EVER YET DEVISED

22:40.026 --> 22:42.161
"BY HUMANKIND
FOR HOLDING A GOVERNMENT

22:42.194 --> 22:44.631
TO THE PRINCIPLES
OF ITS CONSTITUTION."

22:44.664 --> 22:45.698
ARE THE PEOPLE READY
TO PROCEED?

22:45.732 --> 22:47.166
>> WE ARE, YOUR HONOR.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.901
>> DEFENSE READY?
>> UH, SIDEBAR.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.870
>> APPROACH.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.108
PROBLEMS SO SOON,
MR. HOROWITZ?

22:56.142 --> 22:58.945
>> I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
MY CLIENT'S HEALTH, YOUR HONOR.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.013
HE HASN'T EATEN
SINCE HIS REMAND.

23:01.047 --> 23:01.914
>> PRISON FOOD NOT UP
TO HIS STANDARDS?

23:01.948 --> 23:03.082
>> HE'S ON A HUNGER STRIKE
IN PROTEST.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.552
>> OH, YEAH, HIS PLIGHT'S
RIGHT UP THERE WITH GANDHI.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.654
>> THE LAW REQUIRES
THAT HE BE FIT TO PARTICIPATE

23:07.687 --> 23:08.788
IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, MS. CABOT.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.857
>> PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE FASTED
FOR LONGER THAN HE HAS

23:10.890 --> 23:13.726
FOR RELIGIOUS
OR DIETARY REASONS.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.061
>> I JUST DON'T WANT HIM
PASSING OUT IN OPEN COURT.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.996
I'LL SPEAK TO HIM
AT THE LUNCH BREAK.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.699
STEP BACK.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.568
WE'LL NOW HEAR
OPENING ARGUMENTS,

23:21.601 --> 23:23.970
STARTING WITH THE PROSECUTION.

23:24.003 --> 23:28.207
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA CALL
A BRIEF RECESS.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.009
REMIND THE MEMBERS
OF THE JURY

23:30.042 --> 23:31.544
THAT THEY ARE UNDER OATH

23:31.578 --> 23:33.613
NOT TO SPEAK TO ANYONE
ABOUT THIS CASE,

23:33.646 --> 23:34.881
INCLUDING FELLOW JURORS.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.215
BE 15 MINUTES.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.917
YEAH, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.653
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HIM YET?

23:40.687 --> 23:43.823
>> KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

23:43.856 --> 23:47.026
I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON
AS I HAVE SOMETHING.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.896
[phone snaps shut]

23:49.929 --> 23:52.064
>> NICE TRY.

23:52.098 --> 23:55.502
THAT WAS MARSHALL'S DADDY,
WASN'T IT?

23:55.535 --> 23:57.504
YOU SHOULD LET ME TALK TO HIM.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.138
>> OH, YEAH?
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID?

23:59.171 --> 24:01.574
>> I WOULD'VE TOLD HIM
HOW SWEET HIS BOY WAS.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.242
PUDGY LITTLE THING.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.645
IT WAS LIKE MAKING LOVE TO A--

24:05.678 --> 24:08.748
A BIG, SQUISHY...

24:08.781 --> 24:10.016
SQUEAKY TOY.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.117
[laughs]

24:11.150 --> 24:15.522
[coughs]

24:15.555 --> 24:16.923
[clears sinuses]

24:21.027 --> 24:22.995
WELL, YOU'RE A TOUGH COOKIE.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.931
THAT USUALLY GETS A RISE
OUT OF THEM.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.968
>> I'VE DEALT WITH MY FAIR SHARE
OF KIDDIE DIDDLERS.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.002
YOU A MEMBER OF NAMBLA?

24:30.036 --> 24:32.038
>> I'M NO HOMO.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.840
I LIKE BOYS AND GIRLS.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.275
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME AT THAT AGE.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.610
NO GRASS ON THE FIELD.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.180
>> ROY.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.549
[clears throat]

24:42.582 --> 24:43.883
[sniffs]

24:43.916 --> 24:45.051
[sighs]

24:45.084 --> 24:46.586
YOU GOT TWO FEET
IN THE GRAVE.

24:46.619 --> 24:50.256
IT'S TIME TO MAKE THIS RIGHT
FOR EVERYBODY.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.291
GO OUT
WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.560
>> CONFESS MY SINS?

24:53.593 --> 24:54.961
I'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

24:54.994 --> 24:58.030
EVERY LAST ONE.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.900
I'VE BEEN ATONING
FOR THE LAST 23 YEARS.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.268
>> WHERE ARE MARSHALL'S REMAINS?

25:02.301 --> 25:03.703
>> SEE?

25:03.736 --> 25:06.105
YOUR TROUBLE
IS I'M NOT AFRAID OF HELL.

25:06.138 --> 25:09.308
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.111
ALL THOSE UNCHRISTENED BABIES.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.814
>> THAT'S LIMBO.
DIFFERENT PLACE.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.116
>> [laughs]

25:17.149 --> 25:18.117
>> [sighs]

25:18.150 --> 25:20.152
ROY, WHERE IS HE?

25:20.186 --> 25:23.055
>> LET ME THINK.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.024
NOW, WHAT DID I DO WITH HIM?

25:25.057 --> 25:27.159
>> THAT GUY
DESTROYED MY LIFE.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.295
I MEAN, I'M HIS VICTIM
AS MUCH AS PAM IS.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.030
>> MR. WALTERS,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I ASKED.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.031
>> SHE DATED THE PIG.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.132
OKAY?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.034
I-I'M JUST AN INNOCENT
THIRD PARTY.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.202
>> MR. WALTERS,

25:36.235 --> 25:38.871
MS. CABOT HAS ASKED YOU
NUMEROUS TIMES

25:38.905 --> 25:40.573
TO CONFINE YOUR ANSWERS
TO THE QUESTIONS ASKED.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.074
YOU'RE NOT ON TRIAL HERE.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.310
PLEASE CONTINUE.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.078
>> WHERE HAVE YOU SEEN THE
PHOTOGRAPH THAT YOU'RE HOLDING?

25:46.112 --> 25:47.947
>> IT WAS POSTED TO ME ONLINE

25:47.980 --> 25:50.750
BY SOMEONE CLAIMING
TO BE PAM GALLIANO.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.785
>> MR. WALTERS, WHAT EFFECT
DID RECEIVING THAT PHOTOGRAPH

25:52.819 --> 25:53.920
HAVE ON YOU?

25:53.953 --> 25:56.022
>> IT ENTICED ME TO SEEK
FURTHER CONTACT.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.891
>> WE ENTERED A PRIVATE
CHAT ROOM

25:58.925 --> 26:01.260
AND BEGAN A TWO-WEEK
SEXT FEST.

26:01.293 --> 26:05.331
LOOK, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A WOMAN, OKAY?

26:05.364 --> 26:06.365
>> DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS TRANSCRIPT

26:06.398 --> 26:08.134
FROM THE FANTASY
RAPE CHAT ROOM?

26:08.167 --> 26:10.036
>> YEAH, IT'S FROM HER--HIM.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.004
>> COULD YOU READ
THE HIGHLIGHTED PORTIONS

26:12.038 --> 26:13.940
OUT LOUD?

26:13.973 --> 26:14.974
>> "ENOUGH TALK.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.009
"I NEED THIS TO REALLY HAPPEN.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.011
"I WANT TO WAKE UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

26:19.045 --> 26:20.980
"WITH YOU ON TOP OF ME.

26:23.816 --> 26:24.984
"WITH ALL MY MIGHT.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.086
YOU HAVE TO OVERPOWER ME."

26:29.922 --> 26:32.058
>> LOOKS DANGEROUS.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.794
I MEAN, YOU HIT A MAN
IN THE HEAD WITH THAT,

26:34.827 --> 26:35.862
YOU'D KILL HIM, RIGHT?

26:35.895 --> 26:39.065
[metal clanging]

26:39.098 --> 26:42.869
THEY LET YOU INTO GEN POP
WITH THIS THING?

26:42.902 --> 26:45.271
>> THE RARE OCCASION
I'M NOT IN MEDICAL.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.640
THEY TEND TO ISOLATE ME.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.144
>> SO YOU'VE GOT NO ONE
WHO WILL MISS YOU

26:52.178 --> 26:54.246
WHEN YOU'RE GONE, HUH?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.882
>> NEVER HAS BEEN.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.650
>> ALL THAT POWER YOU HAD

26:57.684 --> 26:59.952
OVER THOSE HELPLESS
THREE-YEAR-OLDS.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.357
YOU EVER GIVE THEM A CHANCE?

27:05.391 --> 27:06.859
A CHOICE

27:06.893 --> 27:10.029
ABOUT WHETHER THEY...LIVE...

27:10.062 --> 27:12.899
OR DIE...

27:12.932 --> 27:14.133
LIKE I'M GIVING YOU?

27:16.302 --> 27:19.238
>> LET GO.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.007
>> WHERE'D YOU DUMP
THE BOY'S BODY?

27:21.040 --> 27:24.043
>> [labored breathing]

27:25.778 --> 27:27.814
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU
IF I'M DEAD, MORON.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.116
>> WELL, THEN YOU SHOULD
TELL ME NOW.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.918
>> UHN.

[labored breathing]

27:42.962 --> 27:44.230
>> THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
AFRAID TO DIE.

27:44.263 --> 27:47.133
>> I CAN'T BREATHE!

27:47.166 --> 27:49.201
>> I'M NOT BLUFFING.

27:49.235 --> 27:53.105
>> UH...OKAY,
I'LL TELL YOU!

27:54.907 --> 27:57.910
[gasps]

28:00.913 --> 28:03.249
>> A LOCATION, ROY.
COUGH IT UP.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.956
>> I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL YOU
WHEN YOU CUT MY AIR OFF.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.926
NOW YOU GOT TO WAIT TILL I...

28:13.960 --> 28:16.095
CATCH MY BREATH.

28:16.128 --> 28:19.165
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

28:19.198 --> 28:22.001
>> YOU CLAIM TO BE AN INNOCENT
THIRD PARTY,

28:22.034 --> 28:24.971
BUT WEREN'T YOU INDICTED
FOR THE RAPE OF PAM GALLIANO?

28:25.004 --> 28:26.739
>> YES.

28:26.773 --> 28:28.975
>> DID THE D.A.'S OFFICE,
BY ANY CHANCE...

28:29.008 --> 28:31.310
>> LIV, CALL WARNER.

28:31.343 --> 28:32.779
HAVE HER MEET YOU
AT THE POOL

28:32.812 --> 28:35.114
OUTSIDE THE BEDFORD REC CENTER.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.315
>> WHAT WAS THE NAME
OF THE WEBSITE?

28:36.348 --> 28:37.449
[phone chimes]

28:37.483 --> 28:40.019
>> FANTASYRAPELAND.COM.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.154
>> I DO APOLOGIZE.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.523
ONE OF MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES
IS CELL PHONES IN COURT.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.159
>> WE'VE ALL DONE IT,
YOUR HONOR.

28:47.193 --> 28:48.427
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER
THAT THE OTHER PERSON

28:48.460 --> 28:51.463
WAS SIMPLY WRITING DOWN
HIS WILDEST FANTASY,

28:51.497 --> 28:53.933
NEVER INTENDING IT
TO BE ACTED UPON IN REAL LIFE?

28:53.966 --> 28:56.068
>> OBJECTION.
CALLS FOR SPECULATION.

28:56.102 --> 28:59.438
>> WHAT?

28:59.471 --> 29:01.073
OH, UH, OVERRULED.

29:01.107 --> 29:02.108
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.176
>> OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.045
HE GAVE ME HER ADDRESS.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.080
HOW TO GET IN THROUGH
THE SKYLIGHT.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.149
>> HAVEN'T YOU
EVER INCORPORATED

29:10.182 --> 29:12.484
A REAL-LIFE ELEMENT TO MAKE
YOUR FANTASY SEEM MORE REAL--

29:12.518 --> 29:13.953
>> I'M SORRY.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO STOP THIS.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.054
I'M SORRY.

29:15.087 --> 29:17.023
>> YOUR HONOR, I'M NOT DONE
QUESTIONING THE WITNESS.

29:17.056 --> 29:19.391
>> SIR, YOU ARE INSTRUCTED
TO RETURN

29:19.425 --> 29:21.393
TO THIS WITNESS BOX
ON MONDAY MORNING,

29:21.427 --> 29:23.329
9:00 A.M. SHARP.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.396
COURT IS ADJOURNED.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.032
[bangs gavel]

29:29.101 --> 29:30.202
DETECTIVE.

29:30.236 --> 29:32.004
>> I'M SO SORRY, JUDGE.

29:32.038 --> 29:35.007
ROY LIED.

29:35.041 --> 29:37.343
MARSHALL'S NOT HERE.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.446
>> OF COURSE NOT.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.582
ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BE WARY

29:43.615 --> 29:45.417
OF INFORMATION OBTAINED
BY FORCE.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.789
>> WE DID FIND SOMETHING.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.895
>> LINDA.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.397
WHAT IS THAT?
PAINT?

29:58.430 --> 30:00.532
>> YOU LOST YOUR BOY
IN MARCH OF '79.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.235
I BELIEVE ROY LEFT
HIS REMAINS HERE

30:03.269 --> 30:05.304
FOR A FEW MONTHS,
THEN MOVED THEM

30:05.337 --> 30:06.873
BEFORE THE POOL OPENED
THAT SUMMER.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.474
>> YOU DON'T NEED TO HEAR
THE SPECIFICS, JUDGE.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.077
>> I DO IF IT CONCERNS
MY SON.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.311
TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.148
>> POSTMORTEM BODY FATS
BREAK DOWN

30:16.182 --> 30:18.117
INTO ADIPOCERE.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.119
WHEN THAT COMBINES
WITH AN ACIDIC-BASED CLEANSER,

30:20.152 --> 30:23.255
IT LEAVES A DISTINCTIVE
WHITE STAIN.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.969
>> SO THAT IS...

30:37.003 --> 30:39.105
PART OF HIM.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.045
LOOKS LIKE AN ANGEL.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.323
>> SOMETHING'S WRONG.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.190
>> WHAT?

30:58.224 --> 30:59.191
>> I DON'T KNOW.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.159
MS. CABOT CALLED AND TOLD ME

31:00.192 --> 31:01.293
THEY MAY NOT GET TO ME TODAY.

31:01.327 --> 31:02.328
THAT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN
STARTED YET.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.595
>> SHE DIDN'T SAY WHY?

31:03.629 --> 31:05.064
>> I'M SURE IT'S SOME TRICK
TYLER PULLED

31:05.097 --> 31:06.198
JUST TO TORTURE ME.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.499
ALEX WORKED WITH ME
ALL WEEKEND.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.935
I JUST WANT TO GET THIS
OVER WITH.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.169
>> OKAY, OKAY.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.238
I'LL GO FIND OUT
WHAT THE HOLDUP IS.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.675
ALEX, WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.277
>> JUDGE KOEHLER
HASN'T SHOWN UP YET,

31:18.310 --> 31:19.578
AND HE'S A STICKLER
FOR PUNCTUALITY.

31:19.611 --> 31:20.612
>> HAS ANYONE TALKED TO HIM?

31:20.646 --> 31:21.480
>> NOT SINCE FRIDAY.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.249
THE CLERK TRIED HIS HOME,
HIS CELL.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.116
NO ANSWER.

31:24.150 --> 31:27.286
>> I HAVE AN IDEA
WHERE HE MIGHT BE.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.487
>> OKAY, DOUBLE-CHECK
AND CALL ME BACK

31:28.520 --> 31:31.357
IF HE SHOWS UP THERE.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.358
SORRY, LIV.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.127
NO RECORD OF THE JUDGE
ON THE LOG AT SING SING.

31:35.161 --> 31:37.964
LAST PERSON THERE
TO VISIT ROY WAS ELLIOT.

31:37.997 --> 31:41.533
>> TYLER WASN'T OUT
THIS WEEKEND, WAS HE?

31:41.567 --> 31:43.970
>> NO, HE WAS LOCKED UP
SAFELY AT RIKERS.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.504
>> YOU SAID THAT HE MADE
VEILED THREATS

31:45.537 --> 31:47.239
AGAINST JUDGE KOEHLER
AT HIS BAIL HEARING.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.307
WHERE'S TYLER NOW?

31:48.340 --> 31:49.375
>> HE'S RIGHT
THROUGH THAT DOOR

31:49.408 --> 31:51.277
IN HOLDING.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.144
>> HE WAS STILL ALIVE
AND KICKING

31:52.178 --> 31:54.146
WHEN I SAW HIM AT RIKERS
SUNDAY MORNING.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.215
>> JUDGE KOEHLER MET WITH HIM
EX PARTE?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.116
>> NEWS TO ME.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.085
>> THE APPEARANCE
OF IMPROPRIETY ALONE

31:59.118 --> 31:59.986
DOES NOT SOUND LIKE
THE JUDGE I KNOW.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.287
>> WHAT DID HE COME
TO SEE YOU ABOUT?

32:01.320 --> 32:03.289
>> ASK KOEHLER.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.723
>> TYLER, IF YOU HAD ANYTHING
DONE TO HIM--

32:04.756 --> 32:06.258
>> HEY, HEY, LOOK.
FIRST OF ALL,

32:06.292 --> 32:07.493
IF THEY DISCUSSED THE CASE,

32:07.526 --> 32:08.995
IT'S JUDGE KOEHLER
WHO'S IN TROUBLE,

32:09.028 --> 32:10.629
NOT MY CLIENT, ALL RIGHT?

32:10.662 --> 32:12.098
NOW NO SPECIFICS,

32:12.131 --> 32:13.232
BUT DID HE QUESTION YOU
ABOUT YOUR CASE?

32:13.265 --> 32:14.466
>> NO.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.969
HE WANTED TO HEAR
MY LIFE STORY.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.137
>> WHY?

32:18.170 --> 32:19.005
>> IN COURT ON FRIDAY,
HE PROMISED

32:19.038 --> 32:21.040
HE'D TALK TO HIM
ABOUT HIS HUNGER STRIKE.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.241
IS THAT WHAT IT WAS?
>> I GUESS.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.144
HE REFUSED TO LEAVE
TILL I ATE SOMETHING.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.149
>> THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.717
WHY WOULD KOEHLER
JEOPARDIZE THE CASE

32:31.750 --> 32:33.519
BY GOING TO SEE HIM
AND THEN NOT SHOW UP IN COURT?

32:33.552 --> 32:35.254
>> MAYBE HE'S LOSING IT.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.323
I KNOW THAT HE'S DEALING
WITH A PERSONAL ISSUE RIGHT NOW.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.326
I'M WORRIED
THAT HE MIGHT'VE HURT HIMSELF.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.427
>> I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.362
HE HAS BEEN VERY DISTRACTED
DURING THE ENTIRE TRIAL.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.097
TAKING PHONE CALLS
WHILE IN COURT,

32:45.131 --> 32:46.298
WALKING OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF TESTIMONY.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.599
>> FIN, LISTEN.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.169
I NEED YOU TO CHECK
JUDGE KOEHLER'S RESIDENCE.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.304
[glass shatters]

32:59.411 --> 33:01.447
>> JUDGE KOEHLER,
IT'S THE POLICE.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.182
>> WE'RE HERE TO CHECK
ON YOUR WELL-BEING.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.551
YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP
FOR COURT TODAY.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.158
>> IS THE ATTACKER
STILL ON THE PREMISES?

33:12.191 --> 33:14.160
>> NO, I WASN'T ATTACKED.

33:14.193 --> 33:17.329
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
ARE YOU OKAY?

33:17.363 --> 33:18.297
>> NO, I'M NOT.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.632
YOU NEED TO GET IN THERE.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.275
>> WE GOT A PULSE.

33:29.308 --> 33:31.610
SVU PORTABLE,
WE NEED A BUS AT 5--

33:31.643 --> 33:33.445
>> JUDGE, WHO IS HE?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.049
>> THE SCOURGE OF THE EARTH.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.784
>> HIS NAME IS GREGORY BRUNSON.

33:38.817 --> 33:43.589
SAME LAST NAME
AS THE GUY ON TRIAL.

33:43.622 --> 33:46.158
>> GREGORY'S MY FATHER.

33:46.192 --> 33:50.096
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HIM
SINCE I LEFT HOME AT 16.

33:50.129 --> 33:54.566
>> WHAT DID YOU TELL
JUDGE KOEHLER ABOUT HIM?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.135
>> NOTHING. I--

33:56.168 --> 33:58.104
>> TYLER.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.405
>> LOOK, I--I--

33:59.438 --> 34:02.274
I REALLY PREFER NOT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT PERSON.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.176
>> TYLER...

34:04.210 --> 34:07.379
DID YOUR FATHER
SEXUALLY ABUSE YOU?

34:10.849 --> 34:12.384
>> THAT'S WHAT THE JUDGE
KEPT ASKING ME.

34:12.418 --> 34:15.121
>> THIS IS IMPORTANT.

34:15.154 --> 34:18.324
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

34:23.329 --> 34:25.331
>> THAT HE HAD...

34:27.833 --> 34:31.170
MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD.

34:33.605 --> 34:37.743
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KOEHLER
GOT SO EMOTIONAL ABOUT.

34:37.776 --> 34:39.745
I WAS THE ONE ABUSED...

34:39.778 --> 34:41.613
NOT HIM.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.787
>> THE BODY LEFT
IN THE POOL HOUSE

34:48.820 --> 34:50.356
WASN'T JUDGE KOEHLER'S SON.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.125
>> OLIVIA SAID YOU FOUND SIGNS
OF HIS DECOMPOSITION.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.161
>> OF SOMEONE'S.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.528
I WAS ABLE TO EXTRACT
A SEGMENT OF D-LOOPS

34:56.562 --> 34:58.697
FROM THE MITOCHONDRIAL DNA
IN THE ADIPOCERE.

34:58.730 --> 35:01.467
IT MATCHED A DIFFERENT VICTIM.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.170
>> I THOUGHT JUDGE KOEHLER
WAS THE LAST MAN IN THE DARK.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.404
>> ROY TOLD THIS GIRL'S PARENTS

35:05.437 --> 35:06.772
WHERE HE BURIED HER
YEARS AGO,

35:06.805 --> 35:09.175
JUST NOT
WHERE HE STORED HER FIRST.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.476
>> SO ROY PLAYED ELLIOT
LIKE A GAME BOY.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.178
WHEN DID YOU TELL
JUDGE KOEHLER THIS?

35:12.211 --> 35:13.679
>> SATURDAY.

35:13.712 --> 35:15.881
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

35:15.914 --> 35:17.349
>> ASIDE
FROM A TOUR BUS MASSACRE

35:17.383 --> 35:18.417
THAT KEPT ME PRETTY BUSY,

35:18.450 --> 35:20.352
I WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH WHAT THE JUDGE

35:20.386 --> 35:21.453
ASKED ME TO DO.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.322
>> YOU'RE UP TO YOUR ELBOWS
EVERY DAY IN VISCERA.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.524
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY MAKE YOU
UNCOMFORTABLE?

35:25.557 --> 35:27.759
>> HE ASKED IF TYLER BRUNSON'S
DNA WAS TAKEN

35:27.793 --> 35:29.428
AT THE TIME OF HIS ARREST.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.896
>> EVERYBODY'S IS.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.598
THAT'S WHY I DON'T LET
MY PARKING METERS EXPIRE.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.367
>> HE ALSO GAVE ME
THIS SHORT LOCK OF HAIR.

35:35.401 --> 35:36.635
>> JUDGE, WHY DID
YOU ASK WARNER

35:36.668 --> 35:39.371
TO RUN A DNA TEST
ON TYLER'S HAIR?

35:39.405 --> 35:43.609
>> TO CONFIRM IT WAS HIS.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.177
>> WELL, I TALKED TO TYLER.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.946
HE DOESN'T REMEMBER YOU
TAKING A HAIR SAMPLE FROM HIM.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.515
>> WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
HE WAS SO YOUNG.

35:49.548 --> 35:53.885
I GOT IT...FROM MARSHALL'S
BABY BOOK.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.758
>> TYLER IS MARSHALL.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.396
TYLER'S YOUR SON.

36:04.430 --> 36:07.899
>> OBVIOUSLY I'LL HAVE
TO RECUSE MYSELF FROM HIS CASE.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.568
>> HOLD ON.
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

36:09.601 --> 36:11.470
ROY NEVER LET ANY
OF HIS VICTIMS LIVE.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.306
>> OH, IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH ROY.

36:14.340 --> 36:18.744
BUT HE...GOT DECADES OF PLEASURE
OUT OF TORMENTING ME.

36:18.777 --> 36:21.213
>> IT WAS GREGORY BRUNSON WHO
GRABBED MARSHALL FROM THAT PARK.

36:21.247 --> 36:25.584
>> HE DESTROYED
MY LITTLE BOY.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.453
>> TYLER'S NOT THE MAN
MARSHALL WOULD'VE BEEN

36:27.486 --> 36:30.456
IF SHAWNA AND I HAD RAISED HIM.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.825
>> I KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS PREACHING
PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY,

36:33.859 --> 36:34.960
BUT IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.295
HE WAS TORTURED.

36:36.328 --> 36:39.298
I SHOULD'VE KEPT LOOKING
FOR HIM.

36:39.331 --> 36:43.935
I SHOULD'VE SET HIM FREE.

36:43.969 --> 36:46.538
SHOULD'VE SAVED HIM.

36:46.572 --> 36:47.373
>> YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN.

36:47.406 --> 36:48.640
>> MARSHALL
WAS SUCH A BRIGHT KID.

36:48.674 --> 36:49.975
[laughs]

36:50.008 --> 36:51.477
HE USED TO COUNT THE CHANGE
IN MY POCKET.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.245
HE WAS ONLY THREE.

36:53.279 --> 36:56.448
TWO QUARTERS, THREE DIMES,

36:56.482 --> 36:59.485
ONE NICKEL, TWO PENNIES.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.689
I KEPT THE EXACT AMOUNT

37:03.722 --> 37:05.291
AS THE DAY
WHEN HE WENT MISSING,

37:05.324 --> 37:09.328
WAITING FOR HIM TO COME HOME
AND COUNT IT.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.997
BY THE TIME THEY CAUGHT ROY,

37:12.030 --> 37:13.965
I COULDN'T IMAGINE FUNCTIONING

37:13.999 --> 37:17.269
WITHOUT THAT EXACT AMOUNT
IN MY POCKET.

37:17.303 --> 37:20.472
>> WHEN DID YOU START TO SUSPECT
TYLER WAS YOUR SON?

37:22.341 --> 37:24.276
>> IT WAS AT HIS BAIL HEARING.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.912
HE WAS RANTING AT ME,
AND HE QUOTED A LINE:

37:26.945 --> 37:31.483
"A TYRANT WILL ALWAYS FIND
A PRETEXT FOR HIS TYRANNY."

37:31.517 --> 37:34.786
IT'S A MORAL FROM AN AESOP FABLE
I USED TO READ TO HIM,

37:34.820 --> 37:36.988
THE WOLF AND THE LAMB.

37:39.425 --> 37:40.892
HE REMEMBERED.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.961
>> THAT'S WHEN YOU HAD ME
CHECK OUT ROY

37:42.994 --> 37:44.996
TO MAKE SURE
THERE REALLY WAS A BODY.

37:45.030 --> 37:48.334
>> [sighs]

37:48.367 --> 37:52.037
CAN YOU IMAGINE
HOW ASTRONOMICAL THE ODDS WERE?

37:52.070 --> 37:55.341
ALEX WAS TRYING TO GET
ANOTHER JUDGE FOR THE CASE.

37:55.374 --> 37:56.342
I JUST HAPPENED TO WALK BY.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.945
IF I HADN'T WALKED BY
AT THAT EXACT MOMENT...

37:59.978 --> 38:02.981
IF MARSHALL HADN'T REMEMBERED
THAT FABLE...

38:06.785 --> 38:11.390
FATE BROUGHT US BACK TOGETHER.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.492
WELL, ALMOST.

38:13.525 --> 38:16.462
>> AFTER WHAT GREGORY BRUNSON
DID TO YOU,

38:16.495 --> 38:20.432
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD SHOT
AT TEMPORARY INSANITY.

38:20.466 --> 38:21.900
MAYBE JURY NULLIFICATION.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.102
>> NO, THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
A TRIAL.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.706
I'VE BETRAYED EVERYTHING
I EVER STOOD FOR.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.107
I'VE ADMITTED MY GUILT.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.478
I'LL TAKE WHATEVER PUNISHMENT
THE JUDGE SEES FIT.

38:32.511 --> 38:35.681
>> YOU'VE DEDICATED YOUR ENTIRE
LIFE TO THE LEGAL SYSTEM.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.049
LET IT WORK FOR YOU NOW.

38:38.083 --> 38:42.388
>> "CHASE AFTER THE TRUTH
LIKE HELL.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.355
"YOU'LL FREE YOURSELF,

38:43.389 --> 38:45.857
EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER TOUCH
ITS COATTAILS."

38:45.891 --> 38:48.927
GOOD OLD DARROW.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.130
WELL...

38:52.163 --> 38:54.132
I FOUND THE TRUTH.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.669
I AM FREE.

38:57.703 --> 39:01.907
I JUST HAVE ONE REQUEST.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.442
>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

39:03.475 --> 39:04.543
FIRST, I'M BEING TRANSPORTED
TO COURT

39:04.576 --> 39:05.777
FOR MY NEW PRETRIAL HEARING,

39:05.811 --> 39:07.112
AND THEN I GET RAILROADED
BACK HERE?

39:07.145 --> 39:08.246
>> THERE'S SOMEBODY
THAT YOU NEED TO SEE.

39:08.279 --> 39:10.916
>> OKAY, THE ONLY PERSON
I NEED TO SEE IS MY ATTORNEY.

39:10.949 --> 39:11.950
DOES HE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

39:11.983 --> 39:12.951
>> JUST HEAR THE MAN OUT.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.654
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH FOR YOU.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.756
>> WHO?

39:26.064 --> 39:29.134
>> HELLO.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.740
>> WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

39:34.773 --> 39:38.143
TURNABOUT BEING FAIR PLAY.

39:38.176 --> 39:41.513
>> HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

39:41.547 --> 39:43.815
>> I WAS DOING OKAY
TILL YOU WENT OFF THE DEEP END

39:43.849 --> 39:45.183
AND CAUSED A MISTRIAL.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.185
THANKS TO YOU,

39:47.218 --> 39:50.121
I HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH
THIS NIGHTMARE ALL OVER AGAIN.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.157
>> I'M SO SORRY

39:52.190 --> 39:55.026
FOR WHAT THAT MAN...

39:55.060 --> 39:56.495
TURNED YOU INTO.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.063
IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.065
>> WHO I AM?

40:00.098 --> 40:01.900
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

40:01.933 --> 40:04.903
WHY--

40:04.936 --> 40:08.507
WHY DID YOU ATTACK MY FATHER?

40:12.678 --> 40:14.646
>> "A TYRANT...

40:14.680 --> 40:17.849
WILL ALWAYS FIND
A PRETEXT FOR HIS TYRANNY."

40:19.518 --> 40:23.188
DO YOU REMEMBER WHERE YOU WERE
WHEN YOU FIRST HEARD THAT?

40:25.190 --> 40:28.460
>> I...LOOKED IT UP
A FEW YEARS AGO.

40:30.095 --> 40:33.499
IT WAS THE MORAL
TO A STORY THAT...

40:33.532 --> 40:35.200
I GUESS MY FATHER READ TO ME
WHEN I WAS A KID.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.935
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.169
>> BUT IT'S...

40:38.203 --> 40:41.072
IT'S NOT LIKE HIM, THOUGH.

40:41.106 --> 40:44.175
I CAN'T REMEMBER HIM EVER
DOING ANYTHING NICE FOR ME.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.911
>> THINK.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.814
TRY TO REMEMBER THE VOICE.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.906
>> NO, IT'S...

41:14.940 --> 41:16.808
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

41:21.112 --> 41:22.681
[stammers]

41:22.714 --> 41:24.215
IT WAS YOU?

41:44.135 --> 41:45.136
