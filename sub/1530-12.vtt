00:01.280 --> 00:03.886
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.960 --> 00:06.611
You were dead for days.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.081
- I wanted to die.
-And we should have let you.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.767
We gave you a pleasant memory
of a beautiful island.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.320
You spent no time at the Academy.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.485
I didn't go to your S.H.I.E.L.D.
Hogwarts, or whatever.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.130
And an 084 is?

00:20.200 --> 00:22.521
An object of unknown origin.
Kind of like you.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.206
Skye's trying to ID the agent
that dropped her off at the orphanage.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.601
We agreed to protect her from the truth.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.245
You have to decide why you're here.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.890
If you can't put aside
your personal attachments,

00:30.960 --> 00:32.962
then you shouldn't be here.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.804
I completely blew the question
on von Neumann's entropy,

00:45.920 --> 00:47.888
freaking thermodynamics.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.849
The test is over, Callie. Just let it go.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.725
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.
You probably aced it.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.802
What you need a little distraction.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.567
This'll distract me just fine.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.529
Yeah, well, suit yourself.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.486
Whoo!

01:08.160 --> 01:10.731
Come on, Callie. Live a little.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.320
What are you waiting for?

01:14.280 --> 01:15.964
Callie, relax.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.121
Yes, we've earned this.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.321
Come on,
time to have some fun, Callie.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.370
Come on, take it off!

01:27.840 --> 01:30.081
Guys, get out.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.409
They can't bust us for coming in here.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.847
Get out, now!

01:49.200 --> 01:50.725
Come on, get it off me!

01:52.160 --> 01:54.527
- Seth, pull! Come on!
- I'm trying!

01:55.040 --> 01:56.610
-My leg!
-Hey.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.449
Get it off, man!

02:33.640 --> 02:35.722
There is
nothing more unsettling.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.771
Being a part of something so horrible.
Completely unaware.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.245
The cadet could've died.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.601
We drew up those concepts years ago.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.248
We didn't know
they'd be applied in that way.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.766
Is this the device
they found in the frozen pool?

02:48.840 --> 02:51.161
Correction, the instantly frozen
indoor pool?

02:51.240 --> 02:53.607
Seems like it was
planted in the filter days before.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.603
Like someone was waiting
for those specific cadets.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.920
Well, as far as they can tell,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.368
the device uses a crystalline
nucleation process she designed.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.442
And a delivery mechanism he invented.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.608
That's why we're being asked to
consult on the investigation.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.291
- So, we're going to the Academy?
-Science and Technology Division.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.450
Cadets are pretty shaken up
over what happened.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.961
Agent Weaver asked if you two

03:11.040 --> 03:13.202
could speak to the student body
about "potentiality."

03:13.280 --> 03:15.044
- Calm them down.
-Of course.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.124
The talk. We've all heard the talk.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.043
- I haven't.
- I guess you will.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.808
Well, I've heard a lot
about the Academy.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.530
I'm excited to finally see it.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.802
Me too.
Never been to Sci-Tech before.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.927
Never?

03:28.240 --> 03:31.084
Huh. The different S.H.I.E.L.D.
Academies don't interact?

03:31.600 --> 03:33.807
Not much.
Academy of Communications does.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.565
But they're the biggest,
and focused on data analysis.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.563
- Boring.
-By far the easiest to get into.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.041
- That's where you'd be, Skye.
-Thanks.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.248
Operations is
the most aggressive program.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.721
More people wash out of
Operations than the other Academies.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.484
So, which one is the hardest to get into?

03:50.280 --> 03:53.568
I'm picking up on the rivalry
between Sciences and Operations.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.005
You and Coulson past all that,

03:55.080 --> 03:56.844
or are you going to help Ward
steal their mascot?

03:56.960 --> 03:59.008
We're not going.
After we drop you off,

03:59.120 --> 04:01.771
Coulson and I have
other matters to attend to.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.331
Coulson hasn't come out
of his office in a while.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.841
- Do you think he's all right?
-We saw him at a low.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.323
That's not easy for anybody.
Coulson's tough as they come.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.522
He'll be good.
Just give him time.

04:18.600 --> 04:19.761
While he takes that time,

04:19.839 --> 04:21.922
it's on us to figure out
what's going on at the Academy.

04:27.320 --> 04:30.927
This was the SSR facility
before S.H.I.E.L.D. was even founded.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.246
SSR stands for...

04:32.320 --> 04:34.288
Strategic Scientific Reserve.
Yeah, I know.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.601
Is this where you got all your PhD's?

04:36.680 --> 04:39.126
Oh, no, you need at least one
to get through the door.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.646
Science and Technology
what you imagined, Agent Ward?

04:42.120 --> 04:44.600
Yep. No uniforms.
No rope course.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.688
No defined muscularity on anyone.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.770
No marching in place.
No IQs in double digits.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.362
There they are.
So good to see you.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.046
- You look as lovely as ever.
- I concur.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.571
Thank you.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.370
Agent Ward,
a pleasure to have you, sir.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.886
Agent Weaver.
There's a list of suspects?

05:01.960 --> 05:03.564
Based on the level of
intelligence it would take

05:03.640 --> 05:05.244
to put a device together
like the one we found,

05:05.320 --> 05:08.164
we've narrowed it down
to the top 10% of our cadets.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.890
I'm worried there's a bad seed.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.640
Ops and Sciences have differences,

05:12.720 --> 05:15.326
but both have to be careful
about what we call "bad seeds."

05:15.400 --> 05:16.811
People want to use
the tools we give them...

05:16.920 --> 05:19.207
"Bad seed" isn't
a S.H.I.E.L.D. term, Ward.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.327
Just a term.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.360
I know you've already
questioned the victim,

05:23.440 --> 05:25.841
but I have a few questions
I'd like to ask him myself.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.651
I'll arrange for you to talk to
Seth Dormer when he's out of class.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.842
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to get Agents Fitz and Simmons

05:30.920 --> 05:32.570
settled into the lecture hall.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.921
Come on.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.161
- There he is.
- Wow.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.446
Look at them.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.966
The popular kids. Who knew?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.721
I did.

05:41.600 --> 05:43.682
Come on. While we have a minute,

05:43.760 --> 05:46.286
I think there's
something you'll wanna see.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.844
- The Wall of Valor.
- So you've read about it?

05:54.920 --> 05:57.161
Every S.H.I.E.L.D. facility
has a memorial

05:57.280 --> 05:59.681
to the agents lost in the line of duty.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.961
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history
can be traced on walls like this. Huh.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.847
"Bucky" Barnes.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.641
Puts it in perspective,
what we do.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
Must make you guys proud.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.731
All this history.
Just wish I was a part of it.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.410
It's not self-pity, really.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.642
I'm just saying,
everyone here has earned this.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.285
They deserve it.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.010
I hacked my way in.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.165
Feels like I cheated.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.490
All you need to join is a
dedication to the greater good.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.321
Coulson saw that in you
the moment he met you.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.689
You have got to put that away.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.048
How can I? You read it.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.841
And you haven't stopped reading it.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.122
I just can't get
my head around it.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.323
I remember what happened,
the pain,

07:07.640 --> 07:09.369
but I also remember Tahiti.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.768
What's in that file,
it's the truth.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.841
Says who?

07:14.760 --> 07:15.841
Director Fury.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.207
If I hadn't asked,
he'd have kept it from me,

07:18.280 --> 07:19.281
kept me from knowing.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.203
And now that you know,
do you feel better?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.330
Put it away.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.445
You wanna tell me
why we're flying to Mexico City?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.488
To get your head working
on something else.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.209
I've been looking into
Skye's past like you asked,

07:37.280 --> 07:39.521
into the agent who
dropped her off at the orphanage.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.969
Agent Avery.
She was killed.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.407
But her partner wasn't.
He disappeared.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.971
- Richard Lumley.
- Went off-grid 23 years ago.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.644
Day after Avery was crossed off.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.801
He's resurfaced?

07:51.880 --> 07:53.245
A few days ago,
a Mexican teenager

07:53.360 --> 07:55.567
posted a selfie
on his Facebook page

07:55.680 --> 07:56.886
and managed to capture our guy

07:56.960 --> 07:59.247
leaving a grocery store
in the background.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.607
If he's good enough to avoid
S.H.I.E.L.D. all these years, he'll know.

08:01.680 --> 08:02.727
And he'll be on the move.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.723
We have a short window to intercept.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.927
He may have killed Agent Avery.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.843
Or wanted to avoid the same fate.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.526
We find him, we find out.
How long till we touchdown?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.527
Forty minutes. I'll gas the car.

08:16.240 --> 08:20.086
Today, we're proud to welcome back
two of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy's finest.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.686
Our youngest graduates to date.

08:22.760 --> 08:25.161
You know their names.
Please join me in welcoming

08:25.240 --> 08:28.084
Agent Leopold Fitz
and Agent Jemma Simmons.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.690
Thank you, Agent Weaver.
It's nice to be back.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.842
Unfortunately, it has to be
under these circumstances.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.048
If you don't know the history
of S.H.I.E.L.D. by now,

08:43.120 --> 08:44.645
there's no excuse.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.804
Unless you fell asleep
in Professor Vaughn's class,

08:47.920 --> 08:50.446
- that's a perfectly acceptable excuse.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.722
Our instinct, as scientists,
is to move forward,

08:55.800 --> 08:58.246
advance quickly,
push the envelope.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.725
But given recent events,

09:00.800 --> 09:03.724
it makes sense
to reflect back on our history.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.211
You can't think of any reason

09:05.280 --> 09:06.884
a top student
would want to go after you?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.884
No. The top students are my friends.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.643
It's competitive here, but we usually
don't resort to knocking each other off.

09:14.120 --> 09:15.804
This isn't Operations.
No offense.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.401
None taken.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.164
All these names
you would consider friendly?

09:20.600 --> 09:21.726
Well...

09:22.720 --> 09:25.087
Not Donnie Gill.
I barely know the kid.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.241
He doesn't talk to anyone.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.322
- And he was at the pool.
-Studying.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.731
But I don't think he's the guy.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.566
He just has trouble communicating
with anyone below a 170 IQ.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.930
S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after
the SSR was able to defeat

09:37.000 --> 09:40.402
the nearly indomitable force
known as HYDRA.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.404
We tend to forget
that these organizations,

09:43.520 --> 09:45.682
HYDRA, Centipede, AIM,

09:45.800 --> 09:49.168
were also made up of
extremely brilliant scientists.

09:49.280 --> 09:53.524
Men and women who started with
the same unlimited potential as you or I.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.604
Potential can sometimes be dangerous.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.604
Plutonium has the potential
to power a city,

09:59.680 --> 10:01.364
or to be a nuclear bomb.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.205
Today we'd like to share
a few stories from the field

10:04.320 --> 10:06.607
in which we learned this lesson,
up close.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.967
And faced the consequences when
untested technology or biology

10:11.040 --> 10:12.644
lands in the wrong hands.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.123
And don't worry,
we brought pictures.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.809
Oh, God. Oh, God.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.881
What is this? What's happening to me?
Help me! Help me! Get it off.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.050
Make it stop!

10:25.120 --> 10:28.283
Help me! Get it off! No!
Make it stop!

10:37.680 --> 10:38.886
Find exposed skin.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.321
He needs glucose to lower his
body's natural freezing point.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.686
Simmons, I need
something to break the ice.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.881
Jemma.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.731
- Ready?
-Yeah.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.247
Fitz, talk to me.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.402
Something's doing this to him.
Find it.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.324
Ward, there it is.
Fitz, what now?

11:03.400 --> 11:04.970
Smash the damned thing!

11:11.920 --> 11:15.049
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. It's over.

11:22.040 --> 11:24.691
I don't want to hear excuses
why it didn't work.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.205
I have people
who do that for me.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.409
I just want you to
take care of it before I arrive.

11:32.360 --> 11:35.489
Just keep in mind how much
this will benefit us both, yeah?

11:40.880 --> 11:43.201
Mr. Quinn,
plane's waiting for you, sir.

11:44.760 --> 11:47.650
And you can't think of anyone here
who'd want to hurt you?

11:47.760 --> 11:49.364
I don't know anyone.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.886
Donnie, I'm going to have you
escorted back to your room.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.088
You get some rest. Stay warm.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.328
Sorry I ruined your lecture.
I was really looking forward to it.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.323
It's not your fault, Donnie.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.480
No genetic materials or prints
found on the device.

12:08.560 --> 12:09.800
The components
are rare and expensive.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.360
Freshman pranks are tradition,
but these are something else.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.851
Attempted murder.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.167
So, Donnie was
the intended target all along.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.966
Did he have anything in common
with the cadets at the pool?

12:19.680 --> 12:21.409
These kids were popular.
Donnie was...

12:21.480 --> 12:22.891
Not.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.884
Donnie hadn't made any enemies here,
but he hadn't made any friends either.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.281
He had a hard time adjusting?
How old is he?

12:28.360 --> 12:31.011
Eighteen.
Youngest since you guys.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.084
190 IQ and failing out of
high school when we met him.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.844
Probably bored out of his mind.

12:35.960 --> 12:38.247
If things went well, we were
considering graduating him early

12:38.360 --> 12:39.850
and assigning him to the Sandbox.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.287
Wow! Well, he would love it there.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.771
He doesn't like it here.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.763
So, I'm afraid he'll wash out.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.683
Maybe that was the idea.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.922
Agent Weaver,
keep working with investigations.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.365
Interviewing cadets, instructors.

12:51.440 --> 12:52.487
Of course.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.806
- And us?
-Their interviews won't bear fruit.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.328
We teach cadets to keep secrets.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.529
Where did you guys hang out

13:02.600 --> 13:05.444
when you wanted to
get away from the faculty?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.522
Can we tell someone
from Operations?

13:07.640 --> 13:10.723
Yes. Because we need to
conduct our own investigation.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.044
Dario Marquez's dress shop.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.163
Marquez doesn't do
the best papers in town,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.402
but he also doesn't use a computer.

13:29.480 --> 13:31.482
So, if Lumley's
going to make a run for it,

13:31.560 --> 13:33.722
your guess is
he might pass through that door?

13:33.840 --> 13:36.411
It's worth a shot. So we wait.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.721
And when we get there?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.405
We mingle, low key.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.845
You and Skye get comfortable
with the students,

13:42.920 --> 13:44.160
see if you can
get them gossiping.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.401
Skye looks young enough to blend in.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.000
You're not exactly OI' Man River,
and Fitz looks younger than us.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.809
The time will come when
you won't make fun of me for that.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.486
You'll be jealous.
You'll be jealous, wrinkly old hags.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.761
I want Fitz to go talk to Donnie.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.129
- Sorry?
-Donnie's withdrawn.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.440
Might know more than he's letting on.

13:57.560 --> 13:59.449
You're a hero here, Fitz.
He looks up to you.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.686
Go hang out with him.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.569
Even if he has no clue
who might be after him,

14:02.640 --> 14:05.371
-he could use a friend.
-That is a wonderful idea.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.568
Ward has them from time to time.
I'll meet you later.

14:10.880 --> 14:11.927
What?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.128
- It's strategic.
-it's adorable.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.725
The Tin Man has a heart after all.

14:18.560 --> 14:19.971
So, where are we going?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.571
S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps careful
watch of everything within their walls.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.290
So, in the late '60s,

14:26.360 --> 14:28.522
to escape the cameras
and the prying eyes of the faculty,

14:28.600 --> 14:31.126
a few cadets started sneaking
down to The Boiler Room.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.368
To play cards, exchange ideas...

14:33.440 --> 14:34.601
My kind of people.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.646
Some amazing breakthroughs
have come out of here.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.046
So the tradition lives on.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.122
Of cramming into The Boiler Room?

14:44.120 --> 14:47.044
Well, over the years,
we've made a few improvements.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.166
Do you have
one of these at Operations?

14:55.640 --> 14:56.641
No.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.482
Did not think so.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.167
Drinks are on me.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.922
- Donnie.
-Agent Fitz, sir.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.331
Oh, please, call me Fitz.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.331
- Mind if I come in?
-Yeah. I mean no, I don't.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.682
Okay. My room was just
like this, except...

15:24.280 --> 15:26.328
there was a lot more
laundry on the floor.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.081
You feeling better?

15:32.200 --> 15:33.611
You know,
you shouldn't be afraid to tell me

15:33.680 --> 15:35.842
if you think someone
could be targeting you.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.361
No. it was probably just a prank.
Freshmen get pranked.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.680
I remember, vividly.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.441
But that doesn't mean that
every freshman needs to be thawed.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.888
Is that a design for
organic light-emitting diodes?

15:48.960 --> 15:51.201
- For active camouflage, I'm thinking.
-Huh.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.530
An ionized air cannon?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.371
It's so small.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.289
Well, I was able to double
the pressurization by making...

16:00.360 --> 16:03.284
By making it compact. Clever.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.486
I must say,

16:05.560 --> 16:08.484
these ideas are way beyond what
I was toying with in my first few months.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.131
You shouldn't keep
these big ideas to yourself.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.049
You should run them
by your instructors.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.490
These aren't my big ideas.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.801
So, say you're going to do
what this guy did.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.322
Leave S.H.I.E.L.D. Go off the grid.
What's your move?

16:31.360 --> 16:32.850
I'd hide in the wheel well

16:32.920 --> 16:36.322
of a 747 flight
from Newark to Singapore.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.925
Oxygen. A chute.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.163
The back half of the trip passes
over 3,000 miles of land,

16:41.240 --> 16:43.083
a dozen countries.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.605
Could drop anywhere.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.089
You'd probably head to South America.
You speak Spanish.

16:52.240 --> 16:53.526
Vacation Spanish.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.489
Lima, most likely.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.881
- What with the growing food scene...
-All right. What's up?

16:59.280 --> 17:01.851
- You tell me.
-You're talking.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.048
- More than ever.
-'Cause you're not.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.848
You suddenly became active
on the Skye investigation?

17:05.960 --> 17:07.040
She's proved herself.

17:07.119 --> 17:10.806
Stepped up in a big way.
For our team. For you.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.089
Is that it?
Or is it just to distract me?

17:15.160 --> 17:17.162
Both.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.328
I know you're having
a hard time believing what...

17:20.400 --> 17:21.845
They changed my memories.

17:21.920 --> 17:23.285
Who's to say they didn't change more?

17:24.920 --> 17:25.967
I say.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.404
I know you, Phil.
And I knew you before.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.202
You know I'd be the first
to go down that road

17:33.320 --> 17:35.641
if I thought it led somewhere.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.281
Do you believe me, at least?

17:41.760 --> 17:43.205
- Do you?
-Yes.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.406
Good.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.290
But I'm tired of secrets.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.445
So, I'm glad we're here.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.001
We need to root out all the secrets.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.288
Agent Ward and I
have been having sex...

18:01.360 --> 18:03.010
I got him.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.370
He's headed your way.

18:29.560 --> 18:32.131
Looks like he's heading down the alley.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.202
I'm Agent Coulson.
With S.H.I.E.L.D.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.445
Oh, thank God.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.728
This is about the baby girl, isn't it?

19:36.720 --> 19:37.767
Cyanide?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.329
What did you think
we were gonna do to you?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.447
What they did to her.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.882
- Agent Linda Avery?
- She wasn't the first one to die.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.280
We were headed into
the Hunan Province of China.

19:50.200 --> 19:53.409
A senior agent called in an 084.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.289
An object of unknown origin.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.730
We've dealt with those before.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.731
He said the entire village
had died trying to protect this one.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.207
Avery and I were just
fresh out of the Academy.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.888
There were five of us
running the back-end.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.361
Until we lost communication
with the first team.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.011
We went searching.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.447
Found the senior agent
under a bridge.

20:14.520 --> 20:17.000
He managed to escape
with a gunshot wound to the neck,

20:17.080 --> 20:18.127
but he bled out.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.008
He was still holding on to the 084.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.369
Poor thing was covered in blood.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.404
We thought she was dead, too.

20:33.280 --> 20:37.046
But she was just asleep
in the dead agent's arms.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.641
The baby?

20:40.480 --> 20:41.766
The girl was the 084?

20:41.840 --> 20:44.605
If she had powers or something,
we never witnessed it.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.806
The five of us
helicoptered the kid out.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.481
Headed home.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.850
After we landed,
we started getting crossed off.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.606
- Executed?
-Tortured. Heads bashed in.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.444
When it came down to Avery and I,

20:57.520 --> 21:00.126
we realized the only way
to keep our people and the kid

21:00.200 --> 21:01.281
from being hunted...

21:01.360 --> 21:03.283
Was to erase her from existence.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.486
Avery was smart.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.882
She used the lead agent's credentials

21:06.960 --> 21:08.849
to fake a Level 8 clearance.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.921
She'd set up a nearly invisible protocol.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.166
The foster system

21:13.240 --> 21:16.164
was ordered to move the child
around every few months.

21:16.240 --> 21:17.446
But they still got to Avery.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.249
She died protecting that secret.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.800
- And you left town.
-Oh, I left everything.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.289
I mean, whoever killed that kid's family,
and all those agents,

21:25.400 --> 21:27.289
was a force to be reckoned with.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.203
- That girl...
-Don't tell me a damn thing about her.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.726
I don't wanna know.
You understand?

21:32.320 --> 21:33.446
Just tell me...

21:34.680 --> 21:35.727
Is she okay?

21:36.360 --> 21:37.441
She's safe.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.249
Then maybe it was all worth it.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.841
You taking me in?

21:44.400 --> 21:45.640
- Yeah.
-No.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.688
I'm not sure S.H.I.E.L.D.
is the safest place for you right now.

21:52.680 --> 21:55.570
We'll get in the air and drop you
somewhere along the route.

21:55.640 --> 21:56.971
Thank you.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.131
Bit of advice.

22:04.760 --> 22:08.003
Stop digging.
And stay the hell away from that girl.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.924
'Cause wherever she goes,
death follows.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.650
It's best no one knows about this.
For Skye's safety and for ours.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.089
You can never tell her.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.205
Bartender seemed chatty.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.805
He's in Computer Sciences.

22:33.880 --> 22:37.009
Didn't take long to convince him
I was a Level 7 CS operative.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.084
And guess where I'm stationed?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.211
The Sandbox.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.327
Good thinking.

22:42.400 --> 22:45.882
I asked if any of the cadets
had hopes on getting assigned there.

22:46.440 --> 22:48.010
Behind me. Curls.

22:49.840 --> 22:52.241
Callie Hannigan. Ambitious.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.482
Gunned hard for getting assigned
to the Sandbox.

22:54.600 --> 22:59.288
And apparently, word's gotten around
she's lost the top spot.

22:59.760 --> 23:02.570
- She was at the pool.
-But didn't wanna go in.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.080
A battery that carries
a terawatt of energy?

23:09.840 --> 23:11.330
This is amazing.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.686
Would be. If it worked.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.569
I'm close.
I've built some quarter scale.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.687
They work at that size,

23:17.760 --> 23:20.240
but the heat increases
at a 4:1 ratio with scale.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.401
And it melts down.

23:25.440 --> 23:28.205
Why not use oxygen?
Breathe it in from the outside?

23:28.280 --> 23:30.601
Sure, it's not gonna react
as well with the lithium ion,

23:30.720 --> 23:33.690
but the cooling effect would
surely make up for that discrepancy.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.407
No?

23:37.520 --> 23:38.681
Holy crap.

23:38.800 --> 23:41.201
- I mean, it's just an idea.
-That's insane.

23:41.280 --> 23:44.090
But you should show it to Agent Weaver
before you test it.

23:44.160 --> 23:46.527
You have no idea
how powerful this thing could be.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.647
Of course.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.521
Wow.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.570
I'm sorry, that was awesome.

23:51.640 --> 23:52.971
It's true what the other guys say,

23:53.040 --> 23:55.008
you are the smartest person
to come through here.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.485
Is that what they say?

23:56.720 --> 24:00.202
Yeah. Well, Simmons is
probably smarter, technically,

24:01.480 --> 24:04.051
but that's because she likes
homework more than life itself.

24:05.720 --> 24:09.122
Nice to have someone
to talk shop with all the time.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.569
Or to just plain talk to.

24:13.080 --> 24:16.163
You know... I didn't like it here
at the Academy, at first.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.245
- You didn't?
-No.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.883
I was shy. A bit of a loner.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.211
My mum did her best at home.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.921
But I might as well have been speaking
Japanese when I talked electronics.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.090
So, I kept things to myself.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.720
Me too.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.807
Kids in my hometown
wouldn't talk to me.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.803
And when S.H.I.E.L.D.
told my dad I was gifted,

24:39.880 --> 24:41.120
he said, "At what?"

24:41.200 --> 24:43.202
Yeah.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.760
Well, hang in there.
You'll find a friend here.

24:47.480 --> 24:50.689
Actually, I'm off to
meet the team right now

24:50.800 --> 24:52.404
at The Boiler Room,

24:53.440 --> 24:54.487
if you'd like to join.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.164
Uh, maybe later. I'm gonna try
to draw up some of those changes.

25:00.640 --> 25:01.766
Later it is.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.603
And thanks.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.001
No problem.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.407
Not a bad shot.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.767
You mean for a girl.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.727
For anybody.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.851
Elastic collision equations,
contact point geometry,

25:18.920 --> 25:19.967
and practice.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.521
Hmm.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.887
So, why's a guy from Operations

25:24.000 --> 25:25.968
hanging out in
The Boiler Room anyway?

25:29.240 --> 25:31.322
Looking for the smartest mind
you have here.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.646
To duck out,
join my top Shadow Unit.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.967
- Is that you?
-Could be.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.165
Shadow Unit doing what?

25:40.480 --> 25:44.121
I've said too much already.
But that tech in the lecture hall...

25:45.200 --> 25:46.281
It was impressive.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.040
Whoever built that tech,

25:48.120 --> 25:50.726
I could see them moving to
Level 6 within the year.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.327
Even though
Donnie and Seth were hurt?

25:54.920 --> 25:56.285
The boys survived.

25:56.840 --> 26:00.401
Yeah. Probably the best thing
that's happened to them all year.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.484
Why don't you tell me
what you meant by that,

26:05.600 --> 26:08.444
and I'll not tell Agent Weaver
how eager you were

26:08.520 --> 26:10.284
to jump rank over at Operations.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.487
I'm just saying,
they got to meet Agent Fitz.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.562
They've been
talking about it for weeks.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.246
Weeks? We just came here.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.446
Talking about it to whom?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.131
Each other.

26:42.120 --> 26:44.691
Jemma, please don't tell me
you've left The Boiler Room already.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.444
Fitz, they staged the attacks.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.646
Well, that's nonsense. Why?

26:47.720 --> 26:48.767
To lure us to the Academy,

26:48.840 --> 26:50.842
and to take them off our radar
as suspects.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.291
You need to get out of there,
he's after you!

26:52.360 --> 26:54.089
Relax, I'm out. You're overreacting.

26:54.520 --> 26:55.601
He's just a lonely kid.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.207
We had a nice little hang session.
I actually helped him solve his...

26:59.760 --> 27:01.091
...power problem.

27:07.840 --> 27:08.921
Oh, no.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.129
That's what you're trying to power.
A bigger version of the ice machine.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.281
You weren't supposed to see this.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.880
This is very, very dangerous, okay?

27:16.400 --> 27:19.006
You can't have this here.
We have to turn it in to Agent Weaver.

27:20.400 --> 27:21.561
You weren't supposed to see this.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.687
We need to go.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.326
Come on.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.885
How could I have been so stupid?

27:37.960 --> 27:39.121
Fitz, will you stop?

27:39.200 --> 27:40.929
I'm sorry, sir. It's my fault.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.331
Any word on the missing cadets?

27:42.400 --> 27:44.323
Ward's coordinating the search effort
with Agent Weaver.

27:44.400 --> 27:46.846
They've set up a perimeter and
are going building-to-building.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.206
Where'd you guys go?

27:48.280 --> 27:49.850
- We were trying to reach you.
-Not now.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.321
- How dangerous are they?
-Extremely dangerous.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.841
This device turns
any moisture around it to ice,

27:54.920 --> 27:56.843
very rapidly, at a great range.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.967
But Donnie's a good kid.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.961
Just felt isolated.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.963
Seth must have befriended him
to manipulate him,

28:02.040 --> 28:04.407
using him to finish the product.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.686
Product?

28:05.760 --> 28:06.921
Oh...

28:07.320 --> 28:09.084
Okay, I think they have a backer.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.403
The device, the components are
incredibly rare and expensive.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.960
Nothing either of them could
find on the open market themselves.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.725
If the parts are that rare,
we can trace the purchases.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.969
Sometimes it's not a bad seed.
Just a bad influence.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.087
Let's go.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.842
No, no.
No, that's not the issue.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.810
Look, Donnie and I
have the device ready to sell.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.120
And we solved the power problem.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.407
But... Look, we ran into some trouble.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.648
- S.H.I.E.L.D.'s looking for us now.
-Seth.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.767
What did I say was the most
important aspect of this deal?

28:37.280 --> 28:39.362
- That nobody know about it.
-Right.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.287
Well, now the deal's
gonna have to change.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.283
We were worried
about bad influences,

28:44.360 --> 28:45.771
he's the worst there is.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.729
Ian Quinn. You've got to be kidding.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.450
Thermopower radiation sensors.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.490
Shipped to Seth's father,
who's a lawyer for Quinn Worldwide.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.210
Quinn's buying their technology.

28:54.280 --> 28:55.327
What a sleaze.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.084
The cadets have no idea
he's a criminal.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.685
To them, he's just a venture capitalist.

28:58.760 --> 28:59.841
This is Quinn's MO.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.968
He finds young talent,
and he takes advantage.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.486
Right? Hello?

29:04.560 --> 29:06.210
Contact Ward and Agent Weaver.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.682
Have them widen their search
to include Ian Quinn.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.888
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

29:12.800 --> 29:14.484
I have to brief May.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.528
Just two seconds.
That's all.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.761
Yeah.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.406
This is an unfortunate situation
you've gotten us into, Seth.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.527
Where are you?

29:24.600 --> 29:27.331
We're hiding at a parking garage,
near the Academy.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.165
There's checkpoints set up all around.
We're boxed in.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.890
It looks like I'll be turning around.

29:31.960 --> 29:33.325
Sorry we couldn't do business.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.811
No, wait, Mr. Quinn, please.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.769
Can you send a chopper
or something to come and get us?

29:36.840 --> 29:39.002
Look, believe me, it's worth it.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.486
Prove it, Seth.

29:41.560 --> 29:44.040
- What do you mean?
-A demonstration.

29:44.360 --> 29:47.170
I want to see
what I'm paying for, in action.

29:47.240 --> 29:48.730
Right there at S.H.I.E.L.D.

29:48.800 --> 29:50.290
Then you'll come and get us?

29:50.360 --> 29:53.204
- I wouldn't be able to resist.
-Okay.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.726
The deal's a no-go.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.643
Let's turn around,
go back to the Seychelles.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.200
- Copy that, sir.
- Darling, can you freshen this up?

30:00.280 --> 30:01.520
You ready for this, Donnie?

30:03.560 --> 30:05.289
Hey, we've come this far.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.811
Maybe it's too far.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.731
We're in this together.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.480
You and me
against the world, right?

30:14.560 --> 30:15.925
How many times have we said

30:16.040 --> 30:18.646
we want a chance
to do something incredible?

30:19.120 --> 30:20.281
Well, this is it.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.922
And it comes with a ton of money.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.365
Come on, say something.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.571
I'm nervous.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.325
The prototypes are harmless,
burn out in minutes.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.640
But this?

30:34.320 --> 30:36.209
We haven't run virtual simulations.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.641
At this size,
with the new power source,

30:38.720 --> 30:40.006
it's not safe.

30:40.080 --> 30:42.162
Donnie, you need to grow a pair.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.608
You can't bail on me now.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.842
We have one chance
to impress Mr. Quinn.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.206
And now, he's our only way out.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.721
We can't turn back
after what we did back there.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.131
What you did.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.804
You knocked Agent Fitz unconscious!

30:55.880 --> 30:56.927
He found us out.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.522
And it was your idea to draw him here
to fix your damn power source.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.601
Our plan has worked so far, Donnie.

31:07.200 --> 31:08.884
And so will this.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.171
What happened?
Is it a dud?

31:29.880 --> 31:32.087
I don't...
I don't know.

31:35.800 --> 31:37.564
Ever since you got back
from who-knows-where,

31:37.640 --> 31:38.801
you won't even look at me.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.003
I know things have been
heavy right now,

31:44.360 --> 31:46.044
but did I do something wrong?

31:47.360 --> 31:48.441
No.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.041
I did.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.090
Ian Quinn's not the only one
who manipulates people, Skye.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.685
We do it all the time.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.208
Actually teach it at the Academy.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.011
- It's our trade.
-What are you talking about?

32:03.920 --> 32:05.729
I've been keeping something from you.

32:07.120 --> 32:10.602
But recently, I realized
I had no right to do that.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.921
You lied to me.

32:16.040 --> 32:19.203
Agent May and I went down to
Mexico City to talk to somebody.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.681
Somebody who knows
where you came from.

32:27.560 --> 32:28.846
Tell me.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.209
When we started this,
I warned you

32:33.600 --> 32:35.443
that you might not like
what you learn.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.930
And I told you

32:41.480 --> 32:44.006
that it can't be worse than
what I've imagined.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.647
It is.

32:51.720 --> 32:55.088
The agent who dropped you
at St. Agnes was not your mother.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.082
But she was killed
trying to protect you.

33:01.320 --> 33:05.120
Twenty-four years ago,
an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. team

33:05.200 --> 33:08.283
and a small village were massacred.

34:14.520 --> 34:15.965
I'll be damned. We did it.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.601
It worked!

34:34.600 --> 34:35.965
I did it.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.201
The ice stopped.
So it's ending?

34:42.840 --> 34:45.286
No.
It's just beginning.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.601
We're in the eye of the storm.

34:48.800 --> 34:49.847
Storm?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.763
The crystalline nucleation
should only create ice...

34:51.840 --> 34:52.887
It did.

34:54.719 --> 34:55.846
Up there.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.440
We seeded the clouds.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.881
In the most effective way
in history, Seth.

35:01.080 --> 35:02.491
We created a super storm.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.044
He said he wanted a demonstration.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.486
What are you doing?

35:08.560 --> 35:09.971
I have to try to reverse the process.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.326
Look, Quinn specifically said he needed

35:11.400 --> 35:12.606
a working apparatus
to come and pick us up.

35:12.680 --> 35:15.160
All the money in the world
won't matter if we're dead.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.050
Please. Just please help me.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.407
How do we stop it?

35:21.480 --> 35:23.482
We can't stop it.
They're in real trouble.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.046
Where is the device?

35:25.120 --> 35:27.646
Most likely, right there.
Dead center of the storm.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.370
We've got to get
Donnie out of there.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.811
Ward, how are things on the ground?

35:30.880 --> 35:33.008
We got almost everyone safe
in The Boiler Room.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.731
Everybody, move back.
Make some space.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.006
How bad is this going to get?

35:37.080 --> 35:39.970
Bad. Can you reach the
North Campus parking garage?

35:40.320 --> 35:41.845
We think Donnie Gill and his device

35:41.920 --> 35:43.843
may be trapped
in the center of the storm.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.524
That's not far from where I am.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.840
I can get there.

35:52.680 --> 35:54.444
Yeah, I can't get there.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.329
Is there another way to get to Donnie?

35:56.400 --> 35:57.686
Think fast, people.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.526
I know one way.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.770
Hold on tight.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.085
Seth, hold the barium hydroxide
chamber in place.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.049
- Okay.
-Hold on.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.565
Okay. That should do it.

36:49.480 --> 36:51.005
- Now take...

37:00.400 --> 37:01.447
Seth!

37:03.760 --> 37:04.921
Seth.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.568
We're gonna have to
try to get underground,

37:07.640 --> 37:09.449
ride it out till the storm passes.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.282
Hey, Seth? Seth?

37:13.120 --> 37:15.805
Hey, Seth?
Seth, can you hear me? Seth?

37:31.080 --> 37:33.811
He's been hurt.
Please, you need to help him.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.564
He's in cardiac arrest.
Skye, get a blanket for his head.

37:41.680 --> 37:42.806
Lay him down here.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.564
Sir, I need a AED.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.723
Fitz, oxygen.
0.4 milliliters of epinephrine.

37:47.800 --> 37:48.847
Got it.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.930
Get ready to clear. Charging.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.010
- Get back.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.445
And clear.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.251
- Pulse?
- Nothing.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.367
Charging.

38:17.720 --> 38:18.960
Clear.

38:19.320 --> 38:21.084
- Pulse?
-No.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.449
Charging-

38:24.560 --> 38:25.686
He's gone.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.481
No. Seth.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.600
Seth! Seth!

38:39.160 --> 38:41.128
Come on! No!

38:46.160 --> 38:47.286
No.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.206
No.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.288
Donnie, I wanted to wish you good luck.

39:09.360 --> 39:12.250
- And I'm very sorry.
-Don't say you're sorry.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.211
My only friend is dead
because of me.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.449
I don't know what else to say.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.727
Then don't say anything.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.769
What will happen to him?

39:27.240 --> 39:29.402
They're moving him to the Sandbox.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.484
But not as a researcher.
They want to keep an eye on him.

39:37.120 --> 39:40.169
Did you hear what I said in Mexico?

39:41.560 --> 39:42.766
What specifically?

39:43.960 --> 39:46.361
About Ward and me...

39:46.440 --> 39:48.090
Yeah, I heard.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.889
I trust you know what you're doing.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.007
If it's a problem...

39:55.480 --> 39:56.970
I'll end it.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.603
Skye requested a moment alone
on campus.

40:08.320 --> 40:10.163
- You told her, didn't you?
-I had to.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.564
Must have destroyed her
to hear all that.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.243
That's the thing about Skye.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.571
What I told her shattered her world.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.322
Her lifelong search
led to stories of murder,

40:23.440 --> 40:26.091
and now it's too difficult to continue.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.444
Her search is over.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.089
Her story ends here.

40:31.560 --> 40:34.245
- But you know what she said?
-Tell me.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.211
She said, no.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.529
Her story started here.

40:40.720 --> 40:43.451
Her whole life,
she thought she wasn't wanted,

40:43.520 --> 40:44.681
that she didn't belong.

40:44.760 --> 40:47.730
That every family that took her in
didn't want her to stay.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.921
Didn't care.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.129
But all that time,
it was S.H.I.E.L.D. protecting her,

40:52.840 --> 40:54.365
looking after her.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.207
That's what she took away
from the story.

40:57.280 --> 41:00.602
Not the family she'll never have,
but the one she's always had.

41:01.800 --> 41:06.124
Here I am, telling her something
that could destroy her faith in humanity.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.682
And somehow, she manages to
repair a little piece of mine.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.606
The world is full of evil and lies
and pain and death,

41:15.800 --> 41:17.484
and you can't hide from it.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.246
You can only face it.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.171
The question is, "When you do,

41:24.360 --> 41:25.441
"how do you respond?

41:27.560 --> 41:29.164
"Who do you become?"

41:44.320 --> 41:47.290
Seth, I've gotta say,
you have exceeded my expectations.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.521
We're on to you.

41:49.880 --> 41:52.406
- Who is this?
-A gent Phil Coulson, with S.H.I.E.L.D.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.044
We've never actually met,
but I'm familiar with your work.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.451
All Of it.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.602
So, this is a
getting-to-know-you call?

41:59.680 --> 42:01.603
No. Just a message.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.049
That the first time
your aircraft drifts over

42:04.120 --> 42:05.610
any country allied with S.H.I.E.L.D.,

42:05.680 --> 42:07.330
we'll shoot you out of the sky.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.169
So, this is a courtesy call.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.124
Well, thank you, Agent Coulson.

42:13.120 --> 42:15.043
And I have a message for you.

42:15.920 --> 42:18.491
The Clairvoyant told me to say, "Hello."
