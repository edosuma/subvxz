WEBVTT

00:07.882 --> 00:09.952
I'm sorry, Blake.

00:10.218 --> 00:13.176
When I told you to close your eyes
and imagine you're on an island,

00:13.471 --> 00:16.941
I didn't realise you were calling
from your car phone.

00:18.351 --> 00:21.946
(Blake) 'That's OK, Doc.
At least I know my airbags work.'

00:22.272 --> 00:25.344
Well, I'm glad you're all right.
Thank you for your call.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.454
Oh, look who's just
popped into the booth.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.695
It's Gil Chesterton,
KACL's own food critic.

00:32.991 --> 00:36.028
Which means it's my cue
to hit the road.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.841
So until tomorrow,
this is Dr Frasier Crane

00:39.122 --> 00:41.078
wishing you...a good day.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.129
(Sneezes)

00:44.044 --> 00:46.604
And...and good health.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.394
- Hey, Frasier.
- Hello, Gil.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.665
(English accent)
I heard you coughing on the air.

00:51.926 --> 00:57.080
Are you coming down with something?
I got you this from Rosenthal's deli.

00:57.474 --> 01:01.433
Chicken soup so lovingly prepared
even the chicken gets well.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.541
That's very kind.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.128
Of course, I'd never forget you, Roz.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.550
Ladyfingers soaked in rum.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.333
Much like her own.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.525
(Frasier Coughs)

01:14.783 --> 01:18.219
I hope this isn't the start of
that nasty flu that's going around.

01:18.536 --> 01:22.848
If you want to take a couple of days off,
I'll cover your time slot.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.166
- No, thank you. I'll be fine tomorrow.
- Okey-dokey.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.771
But feel free to call me
if you change your mind.

01:32.842 --> 01:36.915
Mmm... Plump, gooey
and guaranteed to rot your teeth.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.938
Yes. I don't like
his phoney British accent much, either.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.352
You sure got
a bug up your mike about Gil.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.320
Nobody's that nice
unless they want something.

01:48.608 --> 01:52.078
- He's just generous.
- He was generous to Bonnie Weems.

01:52.404 --> 01:56.317
He bought her wine asking for her
time slot while she was on vacation.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.934
Then she was banished
to the midnight-to-4am-slot.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.396
- He's after our time slot?
- We should watch our backs.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.699
Working from midnight to 4:00 am
would ruin your social life.

02:07.002 --> 02:08.958
Those are your peak hours.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.534
- You're just paranoid.
- No, I'm not.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.032
Yes, you are. The man
just brought you chicken soup.

02:18.388 --> 02:22.939
He'd be bribing the higher-ups.
They make the decisions.

02:23.309 --> 02:28.303
Oh, Frasier. Oh, good, it's still here.
I'm so sorry. This is your soup.

02:28.690 --> 02:33.241
This is the lobster Newburg
I bought for the station manager's cat.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.586
I'll see you tomorrow, Roz.

02:42.495 --> 02:48.445
This is gruesome! A partly decomposed
body just washed up in Puget Sound.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.833
- That's good news.
- Pardon?

02:51.087 --> 02:53.442
Bodies don't rise
till the weather gets warmer.

02:53.715 --> 02:57.151
You get your first floater,
and spring's just around the corner.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.633
(With a blocked nose)
Morning.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.405
- You sound awful!
- It's just a little bug.

03:05.685 --> 03:10.076
But you can't go to work.
You're all pasty and clammy and pale.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.034
And coming from an English person,
that's bad.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.721
You often said,
"lf you can walk, you can work."

03:22.035 --> 03:25.425
Took an ironic twist
the day you got shot in the hip.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.705
At least I had a real job.
Half your listeners

03:29.000 --> 03:31.389
hear voices already
or talk to themselves.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.025
If you don't show up,
who's going to notice?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.831
I'm out of here.

03:38.093 --> 03:41.802
But you really should stay home
and let me tend to you.

03:42.138 --> 03:45.767
I'm a good nurse.
I mended my brothers' soccer injuries.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.377
- I didn't play soccer.
- Neither did my hooligan brothers.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.644
They got hurt
beating up drunken Dutchmen.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.729
(Sneezes)

03:53.983 --> 03:56.895
That'll look pretty
against the glass in your booth.

03:58.571 --> 04:03.599
- Why don't you just stay home?
- Thank you, but I am a physician.

04:03.993 --> 04:09.511
I am the best monitor of my condition.
I'm fine. Fit as a fiddle.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.462
(Doorbell)

04:16.673 --> 04:18.709
I'm sick!

04:23.680 --> 04:29.232
We're back with "Restaurant Beat".
I'm Gil Chesterton filling in for Dr Crane.

04:29.644 --> 04:33.683
We're talking to Louis. He's forgotten
tonight is his tenth anniversary.

04:34.024 --> 04:37.460
Louis, I believe I've saved
your proverbial derriÃ¨re.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.726
I managed to secure you
a private booth at Maximilian's.

04:43.074 --> 04:47.147
Promise me for dessert,
you'll have the Schwarzwaldkirschtorte.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.269
- (Louis) 'The what?'
- Schwarzwaldkirsch...

04:51.583 --> 04:54.939
Well, maybe you'd better
stick with the rainbow sherbet.

04:58.048 --> 05:02.041
- 'Thank you! You saved my marriage.'
- Don't thank me.

05:02.385 --> 05:06.617
I'm only here because
our dear Dr Crane is home with the flu.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.929
(Gil)
'lf you're listening, Doc,

05:09.184 --> 05:12.620
'all of us at KACL
want you to get better soon.'

05:12.937 --> 05:15.690
I bet you do.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.621
Time to check if the turkey's done.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.421
Dad, you needn't sit with me all day.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.814
Oh, no problem.
You need company when you're sick.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.108
You never know when you'll croak.

05:30.205 --> 05:34.676
Oh, boy, your temperature is up there.
101! You are a sick boy.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.159
Thanks for reminding me.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.379
The sickest I ever was was when they
shipped us back from Korea.

05:41.716 --> 05:46.312
I got an oriental parasite. It was building
its own pagoda in my colon.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.910
Thank you, Dad!

05:51.476 --> 05:54.752
You know, you might try
some of my homeopathic tea.

05:55.063 --> 05:59.739
It'll flush out your system
and make your hair more manageable.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.227
- No, thanks.
- No! That wasn't the sickest I was.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.998
It was when your mother and l
went to Mexico.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.877
I was real careful about the water,
but I ate some lettuce.

06:10.203 --> 06:15.436
Next thing you know, I'm spewing
both for accuracy and distance.

06:15.834 --> 06:20.669
I spent the night curled up on the floor
screaming, "l want to die!"

06:21.047 --> 06:24.357
Wouldn't that have been a tragedy?
You wouldn't be here now.

06:24.676 --> 06:30.034
OK, I get the point.
I'll give you a little peace and quiet here.

06:30.432 --> 06:35.301
Oh, no! One time, your mother left
the potato salad in the trunk of the car.

06:35.687 --> 06:38.076
I'm still sick from that.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.546
- Do you need anything else?
- Some more ginger ale, please.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.295
- Very well.
- Oh, Daphne,

06:45.572 --> 06:49.087
make it shaved ice, not cubes, OK?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.367
And I don't like those straws.
Can I have the bendy kind?

06:52.662 --> 06:56.814
And the Saltines, they're too salty.
I need the low-sodium.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.920
Your wish is my command.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.167
Hello, Daphne. Is he in pain?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.731
Not enough.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.713
Frasier, I brought you something.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.891
Niles!
Put the hanky down, for God's sake!

07:13.183 --> 07:16.175
- It's not the plague!
- All right.

07:16.478 --> 07:22.474
This is from Marta, our maid.
It's a poultice to wear around your neck.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.530
The recipe comes from her remote
mountain village in Guatemala.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.620
I can see why her village is remote.

07:30.909 --> 07:35.539
Yes, it is pungent, but... it helps
many villagers live to be over 100.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.747
Marta herself is 78. You should see her

07:39.042 --> 07:41.033
scramble up the stairs
when Maris rings!

07:41.336 --> 07:42.894
(Phone)

07:43.129 --> 07:46.565
- Oh, Niles, would you mind?
- Of course.

07:50.261 --> 07:54.698
Oh, hello, Eddie.
For once, I'm actually glad to see you.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.014
Here you are.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.573
It's for you. It's Roz?

08:08.863 --> 08:11.423
- Hello?
- (Roz) 'How do you feel?'

08:11.700 --> 08:14.134
- Awful.
- I'm sorry to hear that

08:14.411 --> 08:17.050
because you should get back here.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.640
You were right about Gil, Frasier.
He's lobbying for our slot.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.872
Millie in traffic overheard Gil
talking to the station manager,

08:25.213 --> 08:28.171
saying our mid-afternoon time slot
is perfect for his show

08:28.466 --> 08:31.458
because then
everyone is making dinner plans.

08:31.761 --> 08:36.039
I knew it! Geez!
OK, Roz, I'll be there tomorrow.

08:36.390 --> 08:41.306
You better be. I don't trust
that greedy, finger-licking runt.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.839
- How am I doing?
- Fabulous.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.547
OK, I'll be in tomorrow.

08:50.405 --> 08:54.114
You can't be serious
about going in tomorrow.

08:54.451 --> 08:59.127
Your pupils are dilated.
You have a fever.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.807
In that condition,
you won't make it to the parking lot.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.755
I just don't trust Gil Chesterton.
He's after my time slot.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.125
Oh, Niles,
will you stop it with the alcohol?

09:12.218 --> 09:16.655
I can't let that smarmy chowhound
do my show for another day.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.131
Anybody would be better.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.021
Niles, would you do my show for me?

09:23.355 --> 09:26.028
That fever is making you delusional.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.433
When you were sick, I met with your
"Fear of Intimacy" group.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.285
I wasn't sick.
They were just getting too close.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.971
You're right. It's a bad idea.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.713
Doing my show
requires abilities you don't possess.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.951
You have to be able
to size up your patients quickly

09:44.250 --> 09:47.765
and dispense advice
in an entertaining and insightful manner.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.797
This pathetic attempt
at reverse psychology is beneath you.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.647
- Then you won't do it?
- No, I will.

09:54.928 --> 09:58.159
And better than you
ever dreamed of doing it!

10:00.000 --> 10:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:10.402 --> 10:13.792
Here is the cough button
in case you need to cough.

10:14.114 --> 10:18.710
And use this extra-long commercial
if you need a bathroom break.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.466
Those won't be necessary.
I have no cough reflex

10:21.746 --> 10:24.385
and excellent bladder control.

10:26.501 --> 10:29.618
It's true.
All the good ones are married.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.117
You're on soon.
Your first caller is Marcia.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.138
Marcia.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.573
"Hello, Marcia, I'm listening."
That's trite.

10:41.850 --> 10:46.719
"Hello, Marcia. Tell me where it hurts."
No. "Hello, Marcia, I hear you."

10:50.900 --> 10:54.051
- Good afternoon, Seattle.
- Oh, yes. Hello!

10:54.362 --> 10:58.037
This is Dr Niles Crane filling in
for my ailing brother, Frasier Crane.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.359
Although I feel qualified to fill Frasier's
radio shoes, I should warn you

11:02.704 --> 11:06.299
that while Frasier is a Freudian,
I am a Jungian,

11:06.624 --> 11:09.422
so there'll be no blaming mother today.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.312
OK, Roz, who's my first caller?

11:16.593 --> 11:19.710
Marcia. She's in love
with her husband's brother.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.573
This day promises not to disappoint.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.315
Hello, Marcia, let's get better.

11:31.858 --> 11:35.294
(Niles) 'Before we get deeper
into your problem,

11:35.612 --> 11:38.649
'why don't I give you
a little historical background.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.543
'The psychiatrist Sigmar Brom,
that's B-r-o-m, no 'h',

11:42.869 --> 11:47.260
'in the late 1950s, wrote extensively
on the problem you're facing,

11:47.624 --> 11:52.414
'which is amazing when you realise
Brom was a prominent Reichian.'

11:52.796 --> 11:54.309
He's terrible!

11:57.425 --> 12:01.020
And so are you.
Your temperature's up to 103.

12:01.346 --> 12:06.420
Let it go up to 105.
I couldn't be better. My time slot is safe.

12:06.810 --> 12:10.769
Niles is as dry as this toast
you brought me...with the crust still on.

12:13.108 --> 12:17.624
- When I go back, they'll send a limo.
- I'll get you another drink.

12:17.987 --> 12:22.060
- Was that last straw bendy enough?
- Perfect, thank you.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.200
Oh, Daphne...
Daphne...

12:26.454 --> 12:30.367
Take these tissues away.
I... They hurt my nose.

12:30.709 --> 12:34.258
I want the kind
with moisturiser in between the sheets.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.925
The rose petals
in the humidifier are wilting.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.731
Oh, of course. Anything you like.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.800
Fresh rose petals,
crustless toast, soft tissues,

12:46.141 --> 12:49.417
acupuncture needles
where you least expect them.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.643
Howard, Lois,
I could counsel you all afternoon,

12:55.942 --> 12:58.934
but we're coming to the end of our hour,
so I'll make it short.

12:59.237 --> 13:05.107
If one of you doesn't say "l love you"
right now, you have no future together.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.732
So which of you
has the courage to say "l love you"?

13:09.998 --> 13:12.671
(Lois)
'Howard, I love you.'

13:12.959 --> 13:15.234
Yes! Yes!

13:15.503 --> 13:17.459
Howard, she loves you!

13:17.714 --> 13:20.308
- What about you?
- (Howard) 'Uh... '

13:20.592 --> 13:25.347
Howard, are you going to pack up
your emotional tent and walk away?

13:25.722 --> 13:29.920
Howard? Howard, it's up to you!
Can you say it? Can you?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.498
Come on, Howard!

13:32.771 --> 13:35.001
(Howard)
'l...I love you, too, Lois!'

13:35.273 --> 13:38.629
- Yes!
- He said it! He said it!

13:38.943 --> 13:41.537
- Niles is pretty good.
- Good?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.777
The little rat is scintillating.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.468
Why couldn't he do
what's expected of him and stink?

13:49.079 --> 13:54.278
He's even better than Gil Chesterton.
They're trying to make me look bad!

13:54.668 --> 13:58.183
Oh, Jesus. That high temperature
is making you zooey.

13:58.505 --> 14:02.544
No, no, it's made me clear-headed!

14:02.884 --> 14:06.399
I must get down to that station
and reclaim what's rightfully mine.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.872
There will be no more filling in
by anybody!

14:10.183 --> 14:14.813
- No way, no how, no one...! No...
- You're not going anywhere.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.258
- Who's to stop me?
- I am.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.561
How will you, with a cane,
stop a man in the prime of his life?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.976
(Groans)

14:23.822 --> 14:26.256
And I wasn't even leaning on my cane.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.491
- Come on, Daphne.
- He really is sick.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.620
You want to talk sick?
1962, World's Fair.

14:33.957 --> 14:38.587
The tilt-a-whirl was right next to
the Little Taste of India.

14:40.672 --> 14:44.711
I was out sick this week
and I'd like to take this opportunity

14:45.051 --> 14:47.565
to express my gratitude

14:47.846 --> 14:50.440
to Gil Chesterton
and to my brother Niles

14:50.724 --> 14:55.479
for doing such a great job of filling in
for me. I really appreciate it, guys.

14:58.606 --> 15:02.565
Well, now that I'm
back to normal and feeling great

15:02.902 --> 15:04.972
who's our first caller?

15:05.238 --> 15:08.150
We have Sonja from Auburn
on line three.

15:08.450 --> 15:10.725
Let's just hear what Sonja has to say.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.074
(Shouts)
Daphne! Daphne!

15:15.332 --> 15:19.291
- What is it this time?
- I had a dream! I had a dream!

15:19.627 --> 15:21.936
They are plotting against me!

15:22.213 --> 15:27.048
Now, now. We went over this already.
It's just your fever talking.

15:27.427 --> 15:31.102
That's what you want me to think.
You're in league with Niles.

15:31.431 --> 15:35.504
I know about the two of you!
You pretend not to know, but you know.

15:35.852 --> 15:39.288
- I must take my show back!
- You barely function!

15:39.606 --> 15:43.918
Run down to the drugstore
with these prescriptions.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.996
This will have you high as a kite!

15:47.280 --> 15:51.990
- Only until I take a couple of these.
- I don't think you're in any...

15:52.369 --> 15:55.839
Thank you, but the moment
I give a fig about what you think

15:56.164 --> 15:58.120
is the day that England produces
a great chef,

15:58.375 --> 16:03.244
a world-class bottle of wine, and a car
that has a decent electrical system.

16:06.383 --> 16:11.411
Being a healthcare provider I try
to be sympathetic towards my patients,

16:11.805 --> 16:14.763
but I have reached
the end of my tether with you!

16:15.058 --> 16:17.413
You are by far the most ungrateful,

16:17.686 --> 16:20.154
disagreeable,
self-centred, whiny fusspot

16:20.438 --> 16:22.793
I've had the misfortune of dealing with!

16:23.066 --> 16:27.662
I've had patients on their deathbeds
who were more considerate and jolly!

16:28.029 --> 16:31.066
As far as I'm concerned,
you can lay in those sweaty sheets

16:31.366 --> 16:33.834
till you're one giant bedsore!

16:35.537 --> 16:38.449
- Are you done?
- Yes.

16:38.748 --> 16:42.946
Then scurry on down to the drugstore.
Get those filled while I get dressed.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.105
Oh, hello, Frasier!
What a surprise to see you here today!

16:54.431 --> 16:58.629
It's no wonder. I've taken
some wonder drugs. I feel wonderful!

16:58.977 --> 17:02.856
So, I'm going to go do my show now
so ta-ta, pie man.

17:05.150 --> 17:09.029
Thank you, Greta.
It's satisfying to change someone's life.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.708
Look who's wandered into my booth.
My brother, Frasier.

17:14.034 --> 17:18.232
Hello. I've come to take the reins
of my show, so scoot out of there.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.775
This is a good time for a commercial.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.680
This is Dr Niles Crane. Let's get better.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.554
You OK? Your eyes look a little glassy.

17:26.838 --> 17:31.389
I'm fine. The drugs I took
have some minor slide effects.

17:32.969 --> 17:36.041
Frasier, look at me.
Do you see trails when I do this?

17:37.849 --> 17:39.760
Whoa!

17:40.018 --> 17:42.054
Wasn't doing that before!

17:42.312 --> 17:45.543
You're not going on the air like this.
Stop it! St... St...

17:48.943 --> 17:53.300
You're going to go to bed,
rest and get rid of this fever

17:53.656 --> 17:56.693
so you can be as good as new.
Let's get better.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.383
All right?

18:00.622 --> 18:04.854
- All right?
- All right. OK.

18:05.210 --> 18:09.362
Maybe you can help me
find someone to drive me home.

18:09.714 --> 18:12.751
That's the most sensible thing
you've said so far.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.804
(Roz shouts)
Frasier! Frasier!

18:25.230 --> 18:27.460
Hello, Seattle, I'm back.

18:27.732 --> 18:31.930
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I promise I will never leave you again.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.475
So, let's take our first caller.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.818
Hello, I'm listening.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.067
(Man)
'Hi, Dr Crane.

18:40.328 --> 18:42.284
'Thanks for taking my call.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.531
'I'm a bit nervous, OK?
My name is Robert.'

18:45.834 --> 18:47.870
And your name is...?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.082
'My name is Robert.'

18:52.340 --> 18:56.174
I'm sorry, we've already had
a Robert today. Goodbye.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.565
It's Roz.
Could you get Security up here?

19:00.849 --> 19:04.888
Captain Kirk's got control of the bridge,
and he's gone insane.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.704
- Who is this?
- (Woman) 'I'm Janice.'

19:07.981 --> 19:10.176
What's your problem?

19:10.442 --> 19:14.117
'I'm having a problem breaking
through a barrier with my in-laws.'

19:14.446 --> 19:16.198
Boring!

19:20.035 --> 19:23.072
Hello, you're on the crane
with Frasier Air.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.004
(Woman)
'Hi, Dr Crane, this is Marjorie.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.045
'I'm having a problem with my boss.

19:30.337 --> 19:34.410
'He doesn't respect me, and I don't
have the courage to confront him.'

19:34.758 --> 19:39.309
OK, Marjorie. Well, let's see.
Let's do a little role-playing.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.829
I'll be your boss, you be yourself.

19:42.098 --> 19:46.011
Come in and talk to me in a forceful
way, and tell me what you think.

19:46.353 --> 19:50.551
- You may be surprised.
- 'Well, OK.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.857
'Listen, Mr Ross, I've worked here

19:54.152 --> 19:56.985
'for six years
and I've never missed a day,

19:57.280 --> 20:02.832
'but you've constantly promoted people
less qualified than I am. That's not fair.'

20:03.244 --> 20:07.715
Oh, well, Marjorie,
I must say I admire your forthrightness.

20:08.083 --> 20:13.635
I wish the others spoke to me with
an open mind. You'll get that promotion.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.163
- 'Hey, that was great!'
- Wasn't it?

20:16.424 --> 20:19.382
OK, it's my turn.
I'm Marjorie, you're the boss now.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.669
(Frasier)
Come on!

20:22.430 --> 20:24.944
These nice men will take you home.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.342
I'm... I'm doing my show. I can't.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.761
- I'm on the air.
- No. You're on commercial.

20:31.022 --> 20:35.095
Don't you worry your mucus-filled head.
Everything's under control.

20:35.443 --> 20:38.241
- This is my show!
- Hey, this is fun.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.647
Make it go faster! Whee!

20:43.076 --> 20:45.829
- Five seconds, Niles!
- All right.

20:48.206 --> 20:51.482
This is Dr Niles Crane.
We haven't taken leave of our senses.

20:51.793 --> 20:55.786
That bit of inspired lunacy
was just a little docudrama

20:56.131 --> 21:00.090
Frasier and I put together
on the dangers of overmedication.

21:06.016 --> 21:10.885
Bravo, Frasier, for so brilliantly
demonstrating why they call it "dope".

21:13.523 --> 21:15.753
(Shouts)
Daphne! Daphne!

21:16.026 --> 21:17.903
What?

21:18.153 --> 21:21.828
I had another dream. I dreamt I went
to the station all doped up

21:22.157 --> 21:24.910
and made a big fool of myself!

21:25.201 --> 21:28.034
They dragged me out of there
like some lunatic.

21:28.330 --> 21:32.118
Now, now. That was just a dream.
You go back to sleep.

21:32.459 --> 21:35.895
- You'll feel better in the morning.
- OK. Ah...

21:36.212 --> 21:40.091
Oh, Daphne...
Could I have a little lemonade?

21:40.425 --> 21:42.575
With lemons and a sprig of mint.

21:42.844 --> 21:46.393
Anything you want.

21:46.723 --> 21:52.002
- Why'd you tell him it was a dream?
- No fun telling him the truth now.

21:52.395 --> 21:56.434
I'll wait till tomorrow morning
when he's good and lucid.

22:04.949 --> 22:09.022
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.121 --> 22:11.759
# Oh, my!

22:11.998 --> 22:17.834
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:19.214 --> 22:22.843
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.054 --> 22:28.409
# They're calling again

22:28.932 --> 22:33.608
# Scrambled eggs all over my face
What is a boy to do? #

22:35.605 --> 22:37.914
Frasier has left the building.
