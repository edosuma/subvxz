Six years ago, a 12-year-old
pop star with a Tennessee twang,

00:11.642 --> 00:15.286
exploded onto the music scene,
taking the world by storm.

00:15.286 --> 00:18.449
Since then,
Hannah Montana has dazzled us

00:18.449 --> 00:20.221
with her incredible talent,

00:20.221 --> 00:24.155
her infectious charm,
and her unique style.

00:24.155 --> 00:26.427
But underneath all that
amazing talent

00:26.427 --> 00:29.029
was a secret
even more amazing.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.363
That famous blonde hair
was really a wig,

00:32.363 --> 00:35.266
that hid a regular
teenage girl.

00:35.266 --> 00:38.639
While Hannah was doing sold out
tours and blockbuster movies,

00:38.639 --> 00:41.612
the girl under the wig
was going to school,

00:41.612 --> 00:45.276
and trying to fit in
like any other teenager.

00:45.276 --> 00:48.249
Well, days ago, that teenager
stunned the world

00:48.249 --> 00:51.722
by revealing the truth behind
the international phenomenon.

00:51.722 --> 00:55.656
I'm Robin Roberts and today
we sit down with Miley Stewart

00:55.656 --> 00:57.728

I mean, Miley. This is gonna
take some getting used to.

02:18.569 --> 02:22.142
Yeah, for me too. I think it was
six years and 47 weeks ago.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.716
So that would make you what,
11, 12 years old at the time?

02:25.716 --> 02:28.919
I was 12 because I had
just got my first retainer

02:28.919 --> 02:31.552
so you could hear it when I
sang, "This is the life."

02:31.552 --> 02:34.785
What did you like most
about being Hannah?

02:34.785 --> 02:37.488
In the beginning,
I almost felt uncomfortable

02:37.488 --> 02:39.730
without the wig on or without
the makeup on, thinking,

02:39.730 --> 02:43.334
"OK, maybe true,
nobody does care about me
unless I look that way."

02:43.334 --> 02:46.767
But I got so confident because
what I learned was,

02:46.767 --> 02:50.741
the wig is not what
people are drawn to.
They don't know it's a wig.

02:50.741 --> 02:53.744
That's not what they like.
They don't like the mystery
of it, they don't know.

02:53.744 --> 02:56.307
It's me, it's just with
a different hair color.

02:56.307 --> 02:59.580
So that's what you liked.
What did you dislike about
being Hannah?

02:59.580 --> 03:02.953
Sometimes it was kind of

03:02.953 --> 03:06.857
a downer when you went
from all the hype of being
Hannah Montana,

03:06.857 --> 03:08.619
and people screaming your name
and whatever,

03:08.619 --> 03:09.760
and then you do
take the wig off,

03:09.760 --> 03:11.762
and you take off the eyelashes
and all the makeup

03:11.762 --> 03:14.765
and you're like, "OK, this is
who I really am."

03:14.765 --> 03:17.928
You know, I don't have eyelashes
up to here and I will,

03:17.928 --> 03:19.970
you know, my skin
will be bad sometimes

03:19.970 --> 03:23.804
or my hair won't look
that great, but it's like,
that is a real person.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.806
And that's what,
at the end of the day,
people did love about Hannah

03:25.806 --> 03:27.808
is she was real,
because I was real.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.911
Most kids, when they
dream of being a rock star

03:30.911 --> 03:32.583
they can't wait to be famous,

03:32.583 --> 03:35.346
but you created Hannah Montana

03:35.346 --> 03:37.548
so she'd be the famous one

03:37.548 --> 03:39.490
and nobody would know
who you were.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.921
I mean, why'd you do that?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.554
I mostly did it because
I had a famous dad

03:43.554 --> 03:44.995
and I saw what he
went through.

03:59.410 --> 04:03.814

so I could

04:03.814 --> 04:06.917
get away from that a little bit
and have more of a normal life.

04:06.917 --> 04:09.249
You talk about some of the
things that he had to deal with.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.422
I mean, what are you really
talking about here?

04:11.422 --> 04:14.955
Mostly, I think
he really wanted people

04:14.955 --> 04:18.659
that loved him
just because he was Robby Ray,

04:18.659 --> 04:20.930
not because of any other reason

04:20.930 --> 04:23.964
or because of his career and
that's what I wanted too.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.367
I just wanted friends that
really loved me for who I was.

you stayed grounded.

- For the most part, with all
this going on in your life.

Yeah, and there was times
where I wanted to, you know,

08:08.959 --> 08:11.692

- You make me.

11:25.255 --> 11:29.119
And what makes this night
perfect is I can share it

11:29.119 --> 11:31.321
with the two women
who've inspired me

11:31.321 --> 11:35.125
with their character,
strength, and of course...

11:35.125 --> 11:37.397
- Man stealer!
- Sore loser!

11:39.129 --> 11:40.430
Ahhhh!

11:42.733 --> 11:45.175
- I'll be right back.

when you could just

12:39.830 --> 12:43.193

that normal life

No, you say it.

14:26.196 --> 14:27.337

14:53.223 --> 14:58.198
Jake, you were totally
honest with me

14:58.198 --> 15:00.530
and I have a secret too.

15:00.530 --> 15:03.603
And I'm not sure how
you're going to take it.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.536
Oh, come on,
how bad can it be?

15:14.544 --> 15:16.646
I'm Hannah Montana.

15:33.163 --> 15:35.205

15:37.237 --> 15:40.010
Just say no if you
want me to stop.

15:40.010 --> 15:43.473
No, no. No.

15:43.473 --> 15:47.717
See, I can't do this because,
I mean I want to kiss you.

15:49.119 --> 15:50.150
You have no idea

15:50.150 --> 15:52.222
how much I want to kiss you.

15:53.223 --> 15:55.285
Boy, do I want to kiss you.

15:55.285 --> 15:57.157
You wanna what?

15:58.288 --> 16:00.260
Jakey!

16:00.260 --> 16:02.632
Why do you have to be
so wonderful?

16:02.632 --> 16:05.195
Why can't you guys just do
the honorable thing and stink?

16:05.195 --> 16:08.668
- Hey, watch it!
- Not the face, not the face.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.401
What do you see
in this guy anyway?

16:11.401 --> 16:15.345
Oooh, real macho movie star,
are you?

16:15.345 --> 16:17.247
"Not the face, not the face."

16:18.748 --> 16:22.312
- This is Jessie time.
- It's Jake time.

16:22.312 --> 16:24.354
- Jesse time.
- Jake.

16:24.354 --> 16:25.255
Jesse.

16:25.255 --> 16:28.258
- Jake, Jake.
- Jesse, Jesse.

16:29.219 --> 16:30.490
Stop it!

16:33.193 --> 16:35.295
Well, I hope now
that the secret is out,

16:35.295 --> 16:37.667
that maybe this part
of your life will be
a little bit easier.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.570
It's got to, right? But,
of course, whoever they are,

16:40.570 --> 16:42.502
they're still gonna have to
deal with my dad.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.275
Right. The one man we haven't
really talked about yet,

16:45.275 --> 16:47.377
your dad.
He's your father, of course,

16:47.377 --> 16:50.180
but he also writes most of
your songs, he's your manager,

16:50.180 --> 16:51.741
you spend a lot of
time together,

16:51.741 --> 16:54.144
more time than most
teenagers do.

16:54.144 --> 16:56.086
Right, I do,
but lucky for me,

16:56.086 --> 16:58.548
my dad's the most
amazing guy in the world.

16:58.548 --> 17:00.620
OK, that sounds great
and all that

17:00.620 --> 17:02.522
but you are a teenager,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.523
there had to been
a few problems.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.227
Yeah, there were, you know,
like one or two...

17:07.227 --> 17:09.598
...a day.

17:09.598 --> 17:12.301
Dad, I know I have
midterms Monday,

17:12.301 --> 17:15.265
but the new Ashton Kutcher movie
is previewing tonight.

17:15.265 --> 17:18.208
How many pretties do I
have to put before please

17:18.208 --> 17:19.309
for you to let me go?

17:19.309 --> 17:23.313
- Mile...
- Pretty, pretty, pretty...

17:23.313 --> 17:28.417
...pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty, please, Dad, please.

17:28.417 --> 17:30.280
- Whoa.
- I can go?

17:30.280 --> 17:34.184
No, you can stop.
You know you gotta study.

17:34.184 --> 17:38.358
- I was here first.
- Well, I was born first.

17:38.358 --> 17:41.291
Don't you mean, hatched?

17:41.291 --> 17:43.333
You two are hopeless.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.635
If you're gonna act like kids,

17:45.635 --> 17:48.338
then I'm gonna treat you like
kids. You're both grounded.

17:48.338 --> 17:49.599
Now I don't wanna hear it.

17:49.599 --> 17:52.502
We're gonna stop
and smell the dang roses

17:52.502 --> 17:53.643
and you're gonna like it.

17:53.643 --> 17:55.305
So clean up your faces,

17:55.305 --> 17:58.108
get off this bus,
and start sniffin'.

17:58.108 --> 18:01.281
- Oooh, Daddy!
- [grumbling]

18:01.281 --> 18:02.752
No, no, no way, honey.

18:02.752 --> 18:05.585
Why not? Roxy's taken me to
plenty of concerts before.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.317
Not all the way
across the country.

18:07.317 --> 18:10.820
Remember?
"Roxy like a puma."

18:10.820 --> 18:13.693
- But that's not the point.
- Then what is the point?

18:13.693 --> 18:17.127
The point is you're not ready
to do this on your own.

18:17.127 --> 18:20.400
- But, Dad!
- No, Miley, not another word.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.274
Fine. How about three?

18:25.535 --> 18:27.137
I hate you!

18:27.137 --> 18:28.408
Miley.

18:29.379 --> 18:30.780
Oh, come on, Dad.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.483
Can't you let me do something
wrong for once?

18:33.483 --> 18:35.485
And then I can learn,
and I can grow,

18:35.485 --> 18:37.287
and I can be
a better person.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.390
Nothin'.

18:42.352 --> 18:44.294
But, you know what,
in the end,

18:44.294 --> 18:46.396
he's always been there for me
and he's my rock

18:46.396 --> 18:49.128
and without him I couldn't
have done any of this.

Hannah Montana or Miley Stewart.
Whoever it is, I love music

20:19.489 --> 20:21.951
and so anyway that I could
still be involved with that

20:21.951 --> 20:23.853
I would continue to do.

you wanna do whatever it was

20:29.399 --> 20:31.531
Yeah, I mean,
I remember, you know,

20:31.531 --> 20:34.464
being younger
and music class

20:34.464 --> 20:36.606
and I always wanted
to be the one

20:36.606 --> 20:37.967
that would go first
on the stage.

20:37.967 --> 20:41.271
I always loved it and I loved
being different in some way.

20:41.271 --> 20:42.972
And that's what I feel like
Hannah Montana was,

20:42.972 --> 20:45.445
and why so many people
around the world,

20:45.445 --> 20:47.477
girls and guys both,
loved her,

20:47.477 --> 20:50.280
was because she was different
and that's what I always
wanted to be.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.451
And now you're through it.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.253
No more secret,
no more privacy,

20:54.253 --> 20:56.726
no more Hannah
to hide behind.

20:56.726 --> 20:58.988
Just you, Miley.
Are you ready for that?

20:58.988 --> 21:01.691
Yeah, I am, and I know
that it's a risk

21:01.691 --> 21:05.295
but something in my heart
was just telling me
that it's time.

21:05.295 --> 21:08.738
And now you've said goodbye to
Hannah. Are you gonna miss her?

21:08.738 --> 21:13.272
I'll never say goodbye
to Hannah. She is...

21:13.272 --> 21:15.645
...always been a part of me
and always will be

21:15.645 --> 21:18.478
and I was able to live out
my dream because of her

21:18.478 --> 21:21.911
and I could, you know,

21:21.911 --> 21:24.584
have my rock star life
and still be a kid.

21:24.584 --> 21:28.558
So what you're saying is, you
had the best of both worlds.

21:28.558 --> 21:29.719
You had to put that in there.

21:29.719 --> 21:31.961
Oh, come on, I've been
patiently waiting

21:31.961 --> 21:33.523
to get that
into the interview.

21:33.523 --> 21:35.625
And we're almost
at the end here.

21:35.625 --> 21:39.369
There are gonna be some stunned
fans and some very sad fans.

21:39.369 --> 21:41.070
What do you want to
say to them?

21:41.070 --> 21:45.575
Just that I think that Hannah
has the most amazing fans
in the whole world

21:45.575 --> 21:49.038
and I hope they will embrace me
for who I am
as just Miley Stewart

21:49.038 --> 21:52.542
and love me the same
because everything that I said
as Hannah Montana

21:52.542 --> 21:53.883
about them being so wonderful

21:53.883 --> 21:56.546
and giving me
this amazing opportunity

21:56.546 --> 21:58.648
was coming from my heart.

21:58.648 --> 22:00.390
It was coming from
Miley Stewart,

22:00.390 --> 22:02.652
so I just want them to know
that I love them so much

22:02.652 --> 22:05.425
and thank them for letting me
live my dream.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.097
You know what?
I'm guessing they're gonna
love you right back.

22:08.097 --> 22:09.829
I hope so. Thank you
so much, Robin.

22:09.829 --> 22:13.563
Thank you, it's been a delight
getting to know you, Miley.

22:16.606 --> 22:18.007
- [man] And we're out.
- [bell ringing]

22:18.007 --> 22:19.569
Oh, I've probably done
a million interviews

22:19.569 --> 22:21.110
but this is the most
nervous I've ever been.

22:21.110 --> 22:22.572
Really? You were fantastic.

22:22.572 --> 22:24.544
- Really?
- Absolutely.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.915
So you would've told me
if I stunk?

22:25.915 --> 22:27.477
Probably not.

22:27.477 --> 22:28.618
So I might've stunk?

22:28.618 --> 22:30.049
But you didn't.

22:30.049 --> 22:35.485
But, if I did stink,
you would tell me?

22:35.485 --> 22:37.687
- Probably not.
- So in other words...

22:37.687 --> 22:41.431
- Miley, I've been up
since 4 o'clock, hon.
- Oh, really? You look great.

22:41.431 --> 22:43.933
- I do, really?
- Yeah.

22:43.933 --> 22:47.467
- You wouldn't tell me if I
didn't, would you?
- Probably not.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.868
Yeah, I deserve that.
