WEBVTT

00:12.137 --> 00:15.682
Oh, uh, hey, Val. There's something wrong
with this old machine here.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.059
I think it might be broken.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.228
(GASPS)
That's more than an old machine, Double T.

00:19.311 --> 00:21.104
I told you, her name's Vendy.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.232
Right. Forgot it, uh, has a name.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.359
-She has a name.
-Of course, right, yes.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.443
Fritz named her.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.362
She's as much a MIFTer as any of us.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.113
And a little moody sometimes.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.616
So, all you gotta do is say, "Hi, Vendy!"
Like that.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.452
Oh, okay. Sure. Uh, hi, Vendy.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.871
Good. Now bump the left side
with your fist.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.039
Bump-bump-bump.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.499
Then wait a beat, big bump.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.751
Bump-bump-bump, wait a beat, big bump.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.336
-Got it. Okay. Thanks.
-Yep.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.420
CUTTER: Don't bump too hard.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.173
Few years back, Nathan in marketing
shook her and bam!

00:48.257 --> 00:49.299
Squashed him like a bug.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.926
He's an invertebrate, he was okay.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.719
And we got free candy, so, heh...

00:53.262 --> 00:56.014
Oh, well, it's good to hear
you got free candy.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.725
(CHUCKLES) Okay, Vendy, here we go.

00:58.809 --> 00:59.935
Uh...

01:00.018 --> 01:03.313
Bump-bump-bump, wait a beat, and big bump!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.816
-Oh, no!
-Hey!

01:05.899 --> 01:08.902
-(VAL GASPS)
-That doesn't sound good.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.112
What'd you do?

01:10.195 --> 01:12.698
Jumping gaskets! What's wrong with Vendy?

01:12.781 --> 01:13.991
Don't know. I just bumped it.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.576
CUTTER: No!
FRITZ: No, no, no!

01:15.659 --> 01:16.827
Ooh!

01:21.331 --> 01:23.792
-(BUZZING STOPS)
-Like I said, I think it's...

01:25.377 --> 01:26.378
broken.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.418
Today, we mourn the passing

02:06.502 --> 02:12.633
of another very special member
of our MIFT family, Vendy. (SOBBING)

02:14.218 --> 02:16.678
We're having a funeral
for a vending machine?

02:16.762 --> 02:19.014
Not just any vending machine.

02:19.097 --> 02:23.268
Vendy and I began our careers here
at Monsters, Inc. on the very same day.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.812
Me, an ambitious young mechanic.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.733
Vendy, a machine with a dream
of dispensing chilled drinks

02:29.816 --> 02:32.819
at an inflated price
because of the convenience.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.655
She was worth it!

02:36.532 --> 02:37.908
FRITZ: She wouldn't want us to cry.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.829
But instead, to celebrate her life.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.504
VAL: Vendy, no!

02:56.093 --> 02:59.096
My dear Vendy, she's gone.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.806
Old and broken.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.308
Gets you to thinking.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.478
Maybe I'm old and broken, too.

03:08.480 --> 03:12.484
Thanks, Haggis, we'll pay you
out of the miscellaneous expense account.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.034
-(SIGHS) This is my fault.
-No, it's not.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.119
Sure it is.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.830
He's the one that jammed
his freakishly oversized antler

03:24.913 --> 03:25.914
right through Vendy.

03:25.998 --> 03:28.208
You're better at breaking things
than fixin' 'em.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.585
First Vendy, now Fritz.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.216
Look at that, Sulley.

03:36.300 --> 03:39.344
With your excellent management skills
and my comedic prowess,

03:39.428 --> 03:40.971
our profits are up, up, up.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.724
Actually, profits are down, down, down.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.601
Mike, the jokesters are doing their best,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.978
but laugh canister output
has been decreasing.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.648
Right, but with me and Sulley in charge,
morale has never been higher.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.108
Morale has never been lower!

03:53.192 --> 03:56.737
-Maybe your graph-thingie is upside down.
-No, my graph-thingie is correct.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.406
I'll tell you why morale's down,
it's these depressing charts.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.325
We're not generating enough laugh power.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.409
-MIKE: What?
-Until we do,

04:02.492 --> 04:05.037
we gotta figure a way
to cheer folks up and trim our budget.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.205
Right. I'll tell you what.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.416
At lunch, I will only play 17 holes,
instead of all 18.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.251
I'm willing to make that sacrifice.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.546
Mr. Wazowski, we're gonna
have to make deeper cuts than that.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.006
FRITZ: Trim my staff?

04:16.632 --> 04:18.050
Sounds like you're asking me

04:18.133 --> 04:20.552
to involuntarily remove someone
from their job.

04:20.636 --> 04:22.012
<i>Are you doing that?</i>

04:22.095 --> 04:25.015
-It's Bean from accounting. Budget cuts.
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

04:25.098 --> 04:26.350
Fritz has to fire one of us.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.018
-What?
-One of us is gonna get fired?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.395
I prefer the term "axed." Has more bite.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.690
And he has to do it by end of the week!
(SHUSHES)

04:33.774 --> 04:35.234
Here he comes. Act natural.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.531
DUNCAN: (SINGING)
<i>Essential employee</i>

04:40.614 --> 04:42.783
(SIGHS) Sad sigh.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.743
Uh, you okay, Fritz?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.912
Need me to wash your car?
Reupholster your chair?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.664
-Duncan!
-Be your butler without pay?

04:48.747 --> 04:50.541
No, no, no. I'm fine.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.044
You know, I could
really use a Drooler Cooler.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.171
But Vendy's gone.

04:56.755 --> 04:59.925
A really sad sigh. (SOBS)

05:00.008 --> 05:04.012
Whoa. Bad day to break Fritz's
favorite vending machine, eh, College Boy?

05:04.096 --> 05:07.182
Last in, first out. (CHUCKLES)

05:07.266 --> 05:09.977
TYLOR: (SIGHS) All right.
You heard Duncan.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.144
Don't listen to him.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.729
Why not? He's right.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.983
I'm not a good MIFTer.
I can't even fix anything.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.569
Sure you can, remember?
You wrenched the nut.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.529
One nut, Val. I wrenched one nut.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.657
If I'm fired, that's it. My life's over.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.743
No more chance at being a jokester.
I won't even...

05:28.120 --> 05:30.956
I won't even get to see you guys.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.505
You want me to tell you
how to boost morale?

05:38.589 --> 05:40.924
Yes! Because you're "always watching."

05:41.008 --> 05:43.719
Or is it "always stinking"?
I don't know. Whatever it is.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.930
(GROANS) No more coffee screamer?
What's the point?

05:47.306 --> 05:50.851
How about you approve
your paperwork on time?

05:50.934 --> 05:53.270
That would make me smile.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.982
And I've been told
I have an infectious grin.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.817
-Eeh.
-(WHIMPERS)

05:58.901 --> 06:01.403
-TYLOR: You sure this'll work?
-We'll buy him a Drooler Cooler.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.363
That'll cheer Fritz up,
you won't get fired.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.615
What's wrong with Fritz?

06:04.698 --> 06:08.202
Oh, uh, hey, Mike. I broke his favorite
vending machine this morning...

06:08.285 --> 06:09.828
-Vendy.
-Yeah, Vendy, yeah.

06:09.912 --> 06:11.538
I broke Vendy this morning and...

06:11.622 --> 06:12.789
And he needs a new one!

06:12.873 --> 06:15.792
That's it!
I got two words for ya, "upgrades!"

06:15.876 --> 06:16.960
Upgrades is one word.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.670
The perfect way to boost morale.

06:18.754 --> 06:20.756
And if we boost morale, we boost laughs.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.050
And if we boost laughs, we boost profits.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.260
And nobody has to be let go.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.137
Except maybe Stinky.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.847
I heard that.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.356
A new vending machine?

06:39.650 --> 06:42.027
Look at that. It even has hot foods.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.904
That's pretty hot.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.032
That's right, sir.
I had it installed just for you.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.911
You had it installed?
No, no. This wasn't Duncan's idea.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.372
Yeah, Val and I
gave Mike the idea to upgrade.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.332
-But I approved the delivery.
-No, no.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.959
-VAL: Duncan!
-I don't think I like this.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.377
-DUNCAN: Me neither.
-It's too soon.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.878
-DUNCAN: Way too soon.
-I miss Vendy.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.839
This was College Boy's
hair-brained scheme.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.882
What? No!
I didn't ask Mike to send this down.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.843
-Said it was your idea.
-It was Mike's idea.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.511
-Upgrades.
-This is all their fault.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.762
-Keep that in mind.
-Hold on.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.305
-VAL: Duncan...
-Nobody trusts you.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.890
-Not my fault.
-You sound ridiculous.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.768
DUNCAN: You're the insane one.
"I'm Tylor Tylor Tylor Tylor."

07:16.186 --> 07:17.855
-TYLOR: Stop it.
-I'll take care of it, sir.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.275
Wow! Look at all these
refreshing Drooler Cooler flavors.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.484
I like this!

07:22.568 --> 07:23.861
And it was all my idea!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.571
-Really, Duncan?
-FRITZ: How do I choose?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.489
There's Spineapple! That sounds...

07:27.573 --> 07:29.491
-Whatever you want.
-Taste Free, Bilgeberry.

07:29.575 --> 07:31.285
Maybe I'm just gonna go for Bile Blast.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.078
If you're happy, I'm happy.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.706
FRITZ: Bump-bump-bump. Bitty bump.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.043
Oh, my!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.090
The acidity's astounding.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.842
I can't feel my tongue, but so what?

07:46.925 --> 07:48.719
Maybe I should've tried the Lemon Slime.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.804
That'd have been
more delightful and refreshing.

07:50.888 --> 07:53.015
Hey, look, there's an "exchange" button.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.099
FRITZ: Huh?
VAL: Right there.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.434
Oh. Jumping gaskets!

07:57.144 --> 07:58.437
Whoa!

07:58.520 --> 08:00.314
Would you look at that?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.524
Bitty bump.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.445
I can't get over it!
This is really something.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.822
Thank you, Vendy Two. (KISSES)

08:08.906 --> 08:11.033
And thank you all.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.285
You know, I'm having a really rough week

08:13.368 --> 08:15.579
and this makes me feel
a smidgy bit better.

08:19.374 --> 08:22.628
You hear that? He thanked us.
We're not getting fired.

08:22.711 --> 08:26.048
No, no. He thanked <i>moi.</i>
I'm not getting fired.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.300
-(INDISTINCT CHEERING)
-Get ready! Bam!

08:29.927 --> 08:32.888
Oozeball? I thought we were
supposed to not spend money.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.891
Sulley, you're not thinking
like an out-of-touch overpaid CEO.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.601
To make money, you gotta spend money.

08:39.228 --> 08:40.395
NEEDLEMAN: No!

08:40.854 --> 08:41.980
-No!
-(GROANS)

08:42.064 --> 08:44.066
-SANDERSON: Goal!
-Yes!

08:44.149 --> 08:45.943
See? Morale's already up.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.236
Okay, we'll keep this one.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.905
Too late, buddy.
I already ordered 96 of 'em.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.330
DUNCAN: He's in there right now.
Going through our files.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.915
Making his decision.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.252
Don't think your little vending machine
trick will work, College Boy.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.587
You can't snack your way
out of gettin' fired.

09:05.671 --> 09:07.089
Oh, I think I already have.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.550
-Whoa! Hot Snots?
-Hot Snots?

09:09.633 --> 09:12.803
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not so fast. No, no, you can't have those.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.471
-Hot Snots are my thing.
-Your thing?

09:14.555 --> 09:16.223
They've been my thing since I was three.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.226
Three? My mom popped those babies
instead of prenatals, okay?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.477
-Explains a lot.
-I win.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.355
-You'll have to find another favorite.
-Seriously? I'm getting them.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.523
-No, you're not.
-Stop it.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.607
-DUNCAN: You stop!
-Mine.

09:25.691 --> 09:26.900
-DUNCAN: No, no, no! Mine!
-Mine!

09:33.740 --> 09:35.659
(CHUCKLES)
Now you're definitely getting fired.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.495
You're the one who kept push-push-pushing.
He's firing you!

09:38.579 --> 09:41.540
-Fritz is gonna be so upset.
-(SIGHS) Yeah, I better fix this thing.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.626
Whoa, no, no, no. You can't fix anything,
we've established that.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.421
I'll fix it,
and you just stand there and be fired.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.299
Ah, see here... Oh! And... ooh!

09:50.382 --> 09:52.342
(STUTTERS) Says to call
an authorized service center.

09:52.426 --> 09:55.470
Authorized schm-authorized.
That's for amateurs like you.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.849
Don't touch that yellow wire.

09:58.932 --> 10:03.270
Reroute this to that. Tighten this.
Jiggly this thingie. And boom!

10:03.353 --> 10:04.855
Let's give this thing a try.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.653
There! Good as new.
I'll just get rid of all this stuff.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.780
Wait, wait, wait. What are those?

10:13.864 --> 10:16.617
You know, extra parts.
Bunch of doohickeys.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.619
-VAL: Doohickeys?
-Not gonna make any difference.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.205
Oh, I think I need
another Drooler Cooler pick-me-up.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.498
I've got a lot on my mind.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.791
-(BEEPS)
-Ooh!

10:24.875 --> 10:27.920
Spittle Splash flavor.
That sounds scrumptious.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.843
Pop Farts? I don't want Pop Farts.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.554
-(MACHINE ROARS)
-Huh?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.100
-BOTH: Are you okay?
-No! I got canned!

10:42.184 --> 10:44.186
There's something wrong with that machine!

10:46.438 --> 10:48.357
-In my office! Everyone!
-VAL: In your office!

10:59.576 --> 11:03.830
Oh, it's like everything and nothing
at the same time.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.667
It just speaks to me. (SNIFFLES)

11:06.750 --> 11:09.169
-What's it say to you, Sulley?
-That we're broke?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.254
Look what else I got.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.090
I bought a Vincent Van Gross
and a Claw Monet.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.883
SULLEY: Is that a Michelfangelo?

11:14.967 --> 11:16.552
Yes! It's culture.

11:16.635 --> 11:19.179
Culture boosts morale.
And morale boosts profits.

11:19.263 --> 11:22.808
Ooh, an Andy Gorhal. One of his Goop Cans.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.102
Very inspiring!

11:25.644 --> 11:28.480
See? Okay. Now this one...

11:29.356 --> 11:30.440
stinks.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.068
I just don't get this one. I don't get it.

11:34.570 --> 11:37.239
Doohickeys? You took out doohickeys?

11:37.322 --> 11:38.615
Never remove doohickeys.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.868
I was fixing it because he broke it!

11:40.951 --> 11:41.952
-No! You broke it!
-You!

11:42.035 --> 11:43.912
Let's all remain calm. Because I'm calm.

11:43.996 --> 11:45.414
I'm gonna call the service center.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.751
Vend-o service. Can I help you?

11:49.835 --> 11:52.462
Oh, yes, you can!
Our machine, it's gone crazy!

11:52.546 --> 11:54.298
Calm down, sir. Everything will be fine.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.592
As long as
you didn't remove any doohickeys.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.135
But we did!

12:00.262 --> 12:02.264
-(LINE DISCONNECTS)
-Hello? Hello?

12:02.723 --> 12:03.932
The phone line's been cut!

12:04.016 --> 12:06.643
It's cut the phone line! (ECHOES)

12:08.520 --> 12:12.274
DUNCAN: <i>My dearest mother,</i>
<i>I pen this from the front lines.</i>

12:12.357 --> 12:15.527
<i>A vending machine gone rogue</i>
<i>has declared us its foe.</i>

12:15.611 --> 12:18.530
<i>Do not despair,</i>
<i>nor pine for my safe return.</i>

12:18.614 --> 12:20.157
<i>Know that I fought with valor.</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:23.619
<i>Your loving son, Duncan P. Anderson,</i>

12:23.702 --> 12:25.537
<i>MIFT Deputy Supervisor.</i>

12:25.996 --> 12:28.999
TYLOR: Okay, you guys stay here,
I'm gonna go out and fix it.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.460
Whoa, and let you be the hero? No.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.254
Let a good MIFTer save the MIFTers.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.520
Oh... Ah-ha!

13:20.425 --> 13:22.386
Who's the hero now?

13:24.763 --> 13:25.931
FRITZ: Duncan! Duncan!

13:26.014 --> 13:27.432
Look behind you! (STUTTERS)

13:27.516 --> 13:28.684
-Duncan!
-What?

13:31.645 --> 13:34.356
Let me out of here! (SCREAMS)

13:36.066 --> 13:37.067
It ate Duncan!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.777
Oh, no! Not...

13:38.861 --> 13:41.405
Any body parts left?
I got dibs on an eyestalk.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.575
Here you are.
Compliments of Monsters, Incorporated.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.578
This one is for you. This one is for you.
This one is for you.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.037
This one is for you, my friend.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.998
-Hey, Mike. What's in the envelopes?
-Money.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.082
-Money?
-Money.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.458
-You mean money-money?
-Yeah.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.210
I'm calling it "Free Money Mondays."

13:55.294 --> 13:57.588
I'm tellin' ya,
morale has never been better!

13:57.671 --> 13:59.339
Where'd you get all that cash?

13:59.423 --> 14:01.592
From your emergency money jar
hidden under your bed.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.676
-But...
-This is for you.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.386
-But...
-This is an emergency, right?

14:04.469 --> 14:05.637
This one is for you.

14:06.263 --> 14:09.349
DUNCAN: (SCREAMS)
Please! Let me out of here!

14:09.433 --> 14:10.601
We've got to save him!

14:10.684 --> 14:11.685
Okay. How?

14:12.811 --> 14:14.897
-(GASPS) You!
-(STUTTERS) Me?

14:14.980 --> 14:16.940
You may not be the best MIFTer
at fixing stuff,

14:17.024 --> 14:18.984
but you're pretty good at breaking it.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.652
Thanks. I think.

14:20.736 --> 14:23.780
So, get out there and fix-break Vendy Two.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.911
-Yeah, do your worst!
-VAL: Double T!

14:28.994 --> 14:30.204
Really mess things up!

14:30.704 --> 14:35.375
DUNCAN: Somebody let me out!
It's not as spacious as it looks.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.004
Time to get to work.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.470
Woah, he really would've made
a great Scarer.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.554
FRITZ: Get back!

15:02.402 --> 15:06.865
I'll never remove a doohickey again. Ugh!

15:06.949 --> 15:08.951
-Ooh, yeah! Double T! Double T!
-All right!

15:09.034 --> 15:11.245
That was some
top-notch destruction, Muscles!

15:11.328 --> 15:13.413
-That was some good MIFT-ing!
-(WHISTLES)

15:13.497 --> 15:14.498
Come on. Thanks, guys.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.542
It was fine, it was okay. At best.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.460
I, uh...

15:18.544 --> 15:22.631
I've got some news
I need to share with all of you.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.887
"Oozeball tables, fine art,
Free Money Mondays"?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.722
I have more ideas where those came from.

15:30.806 --> 15:33.684
-How about a rooftop swimming pool?
-We don't need a swimming pool.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.311
-A Monsters, Inc. swim team!
-We don't need a swim team.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.896
Then who's gonna use the pool?

15:38.522 --> 15:40.315
Bean, I can explain all this.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.277
Actually, I can't explain any of it.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.154
Hello? What's to explain?
Look at my graph-thingie.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.407
I've never seen
morale turn around this quick.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.909
And our laugh canister output
has already doubled.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.494
Really? Well.

15:52.578 --> 15:55.038
At this rate,
profits should turn around rather quickly.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.833
It was all Mike's doing. Good job, Mikey.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.501
Aw, thank you. Thank you, Sulley.

15:59.585 --> 16:00.836
(CHUCKLING) No problem.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.254
And did you hear?

16:02.337 --> 16:06.175
Tomorrow's Pay Me Back Tuesday.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.347
Well, accounting has asked me

16:12.431 --> 16:16.768
to cut a member of our MIFT staff
due to budget cuts.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.938
I couldn't bear to see any of you go.

16:21.565 --> 16:22.900
You're my family.

16:23.859 --> 16:27.237
So, just like Vendy was old and broken
and had to go,

16:28.238 --> 16:30.240
I guess I'm old and broken and...

16:31.533 --> 16:33.493
I have to go, too.

16:33.577 --> 16:36.330
-VAL: You're... You mean, you're...
-I'm retiring.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.582
You're retiring! (STUTTERS) I mean...

16:38.999 --> 16:42.461
You're retiring? Oh, sad, sad day.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.004
-(PHONE RINGING)
-Excuse me.

16:44.087 --> 16:47.549
That's probably Monsters Resources
calling about my last day.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.929
This isn't right.

16:52.012 --> 16:56.183
Fritz is the most generous
and kind monster I've ever met.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.809
I'm the one that should go, not him.

16:57.935 --> 16:59.937
No, no.
Don't sell yourself short, College Boy.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.065
As your new supervisor,
I'll go easy on ya.

17:03.565 --> 17:05.609
Good news, good news, everybody!

17:05.692 --> 17:07.694
Morale is up, so productivity is up,

17:07.778 --> 17:09.571
so accounting is cancelling
the budget cups!

17:09.655 --> 17:11.073
-You mean budget cuts?
-Those, too!

17:11.156 --> 17:13.075
-So you can stay?
-I can stay!

17:13.158 --> 17:14.993
-You can stay!
-CUTTER: All right!

17:15.077 --> 17:17.412
But you don't have to!
I mean, are you sure, sir?

17:17.496 --> 17:19.748
I mean, you know,
think about all the gardening, huh?

17:19.831 --> 17:22.876
Travel discounts,
the pickle ball tournaments! Come on!

17:22.960 --> 17:25.921
I'm sure, Duncan.
None of us MIFTers are goin' anywhere.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.005
Though... (SIGHS)

17:28.090 --> 17:29.800
We still lost Vendy.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.223
Morning, MIFTers!

17:36.306 --> 17:38.517
-So, uh, what's up?
-I don't know.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.561
Tylor wouldn't let us in
till you got here.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.940
Come on in. But cover your eyes.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.442
All right. There you go, come on in.

17:47.526 --> 17:51.989
Yeah, yeah. Just over here.
Careful, careful. Okay.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.119
Hold right there. Up, up! Keep 'em closed.

17:57.202 --> 17:59.246
And open!

17:59.329 --> 18:00.455
Surprise!

18:03.208 --> 18:05.586
FRITZ: Vendy, she's back!
VAL: Vendy!

18:05.669 --> 18:06.837
Ah! You fixed her!

18:06.920 --> 18:08.380
More like blindly cobbled.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.049
Hey, look,
I fixed something all by myself.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.093
And I kept all the doohickeys.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.553
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.431
Well, give it a try, Ty-Ty. Give it a try!

18:17.514 --> 18:18.599
Hi, Vendy!

18:21.101 --> 18:23.520
Bump-bump-bump, big bump!

18:28.025 --> 18:29.484
One Drooler Cooler!

18:29.568 --> 18:33.197
Who needs all those fancy flavors
when I've got Drooler Cooler Classic?

18:33.280 --> 18:36.325
-(KISSES)
-And we get to keep classic Fritz.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.411
Goodness, I feel just like Vendy,

18:39.494 --> 18:43.582
all fixed up and ready
to work here at MIFT for years to come!

18:43.665 --> 18:45.959
Wouldn't want it any other way, Fritz.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.711
-Cheers.
-CUTTER: Cheers, Big Ears.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.379
DUNCAN: Oh, yeah, cheers. Whatever.

19:05.604 --> 19:08.899
MIKE: Now, if there's one thing
that human children find funny,

19:08.982 --> 19:11.693
-besides poop, it's clowns!
-(EXCLAIMS)

19:11.777 --> 19:14.196
So let's put on that greasepaint
and see what we got.

19:15.948 --> 19:19.117
Not bad, Tylor.
Excellent use of tiny hats.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.577
Okay. Good, good.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.705
Um, Mr. Wazowski, check this out.

19:25.791 --> 19:27.960
-Ta-da! (BLOWS)
-MIKE: Nicely...

19:28.043 --> 19:29.044
done.

19:29.127 --> 19:32.756
Um, maybe scale it back a little, Carla.
Okay, who's next?

19:34.424 --> 19:37.553
Yikes! Okay, big guy. How about a smile?

19:42.724 --> 19:46.019
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Maybe you're more of
a "knock-knock joke" kind of guy?

22:34.897 --> 22:37.691
RUDY: <i>And the moral of the story is...</i>

22:37.774 --> 22:40.235
<i>you never remove a doohickey.</i>
