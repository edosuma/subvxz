00:38.250 --> 00:39.875
You coming to bed, hon?

00:39.917 --> 00:41.625
Just finishing up
my nightlies.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.500
Oh, honey.

00:49.542 --> 00:51.458
I wish you wouldn't shove a
retainer full of cake

00:51.500 --> 00:52.875
in your mouth
every night.

00:52.917 --> 00:55.750
But then I wouldn't taste
sweet chocolate in my dreams.

00:55.792 --> 00:57.375
Plus, I don't want to
change my routine

00:57.417 --> 00:58.709
before a big day
like tomorrow.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.083
What's happening tomorrow?

01:00.125 --> 01:01.041
Ah, that's top secret.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.792
But I can give you a hint.

01:02.834 --> 01:07.792
I'm "poisoning...
a Russian... assassin."

01:07.834 --> 01:09.417
Fine, don't tell me.

01:09.458 --> 01:10.583
Well, good night.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.333
Stan, you forgot.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.083
It's Perfect Husband Time.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.000
Oh, right,
the 20 seconds per month

01:17.041 --> 01:18.875
I allot to your concerns.

01:18.917 --> 01:20.208
Go!

01:20.250 --> 01:22.083
Okay, uh-uh-um...
I-I-I saw

01:22.125 --> 01:23.417
another stray dog
today, Stan.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.917
I was wondering
if we could adopt--

01:24.959 --> 01:26.709
Pass.
Okay, uh-uh-um...

01:26.750 --> 01:29.125
My parents asked if they could
see their children this year.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.250
Pass. Ten seconds down.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.709
I-I rented The Notebook.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.500
Can we please,
please, please
Three, two, one.

01:33.542 --> 01:34.500
watch it tomorrow night?

01:37.709 --> 01:40.458
Oh... unfortunately
we've run out of time.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.333
But, you won't be
leaving empty-handed.

01:42.375 --> 01:45.166
All of our contestants
go home with a parting gift.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.375
Beep beep.

01:54.458 --> 01:56.417
Hey, brother,
spare a quarter?

01:56.458 --> 01:59.166
"Spare" money, never
understood that.

01:59.208 --> 02:00.792
Now, if you want
to earn some money,

02:00.834 --> 02:02.792
I have noticed that
my shoelace is untied.

02:02.834 --> 02:05.583
So I'll offer you a nickel
to tie it for me.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.667
Here's a quarter.
Thanks.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I said a nickel.

02:15.375 --> 02:16.500
I got change coming.

02:16.542 --> 02:18.500
I don't have any.
No change?!

02:18.542 --> 02:21.125
This is how you
run a business?!

02:27.875 --> 02:31.417
Excuse me, where did you
get your shoelace tied?

02:31.458 --> 02:33.083
I do it myself, ma'am.

02:40.041 --> 02:42.709
- Sugar?
- I don't take sugar.

02:43.959 --> 02:45.500
Damn it!

02:48.041 --> 02:49.959
Whoo-hoo!

02:50.000 --> 02:51.417
Congratulations, Smith.

02:51.458 --> 02:52.834
Wait, what's going on?

02:55.834 --> 02:57.291
That was your 100th kill.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.667
Get out of town.

02:59.709 --> 03:01.542
We all wanted
to be here for it.

03:01.583 --> 03:02.542
Well, thank you, sir.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.750
But I think
I only have 99 kills.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.583
We're counting
that agent who died

03:06.625 --> 03:08.750
when you refused to
give him some bone marrow.

03:08.792 --> 03:11.000
Even though you were
a perfect match.

03:11.041 --> 03:12.834
Happy 100th, Stan.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.333
It's not my birthday, dumb-ass.

03:14.375 --> 03:15.583
No! I meant a hundred--

03:15.625 --> 03:16.625
And a hundred.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.750
I look 40, tops.

03:17.792 --> 03:18.792
You look a hundred.

03:18.834 --> 03:20.375
Do-do-doesn't
Dick look a hundred?

03:20.417 --> 03:22.583
You do look old, Dick.

03:26.917 --> 03:29.375
No retainer full of
cake tonight, sweetie?

03:29.417 --> 03:31.875
Time to leave that
boyish tradition behind.

03:31.917 --> 03:33.500
I've killed a hundred people.

03:33.542 --> 03:34.917
I'm a man now.

03:34.959 --> 03:36.208
A hundred people?

03:36.250 --> 03:38.542
Plus I had 11 pieces
of cake at my party,

03:38.583 --> 03:41.250
and I threw up all over
the elevator buttons.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.125
Good morning, sweetie.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.166
What...?

03:49.208 --> 03:50.667
What are you smiling for?

03:50.709 --> 03:52.041
Why am I covered in cake?

03:52.083 --> 03:54.542
Oh, honey, you were so cute.

03:54.583 --> 03:56.041
You were sleepwalking.

03:56.083 --> 03:59.250
And I walked downstairs
and got some cake?

03:59.291 --> 04:01.667
That's not all you did.
What?!

04:01.709 --> 04:04.750
You sat me down and insisted
we watch The Notebook.

04:04.792 --> 04:06.750
I did not watch The Notebook.

04:06.792 --> 04:08.917
Boy, did you cry
when Noah bought

04:08.959 --> 04:10.667
the abandoned house
on the lake.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.750
Only because it fulfilled
Allie's lifelong dream.

04:12.792 --> 04:14.709
Oh, my God, I watched
The Notebook!

04:16.792 --> 04:17.709
What the hell is this?!

04:17.750 --> 04:19.208
That's Rashes.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.375
Our shelter dog.

04:20.417 --> 04:22.041
You adopted him last night.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.375
Why's he named Rashes?

04:23.417 --> 04:25.417
Ah! Oh, gross! Ah!

04:26.667 --> 04:27.959
Something terrible
happened to me!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.375
I have to see Dr. Penguin!

04:29.417 --> 04:31.458
Which one do you think, Stan?

04:31.500 --> 04:32.959
I'm leaning towards lilac.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.083
Roger, I don't want
to talk to Madam Buttercup!

04:35.125 --> 04:37.333
Oh, that's a good name.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.083
Okay, okay. Go lie on the couch.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.625
Dr. Penguin, it's terrible.

04:43.667 --> 04:44.959
Last night, I was sleepwalking

04:45.000 --> 04:47.125
and I did all these
horribly nice things.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.000
Nice things, eh?

04:49.041 --> 04:51.250
Seems like someone's
conscience is coming out.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.458
Of the closet?

04:52.500 --> 04:53.500
I don't have a conscience.

04:53.542 --> 04:54.792
Let alone a gay conscience.

04:54.834 --> 04:56.000
No conscience?

04:56.083 --> 04:58.583
Yeah. That's how
I'm so great at my job.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.125
Hmm. Often when you sleepwalk,

05:01.166 --> 05:02.709
the part of you
that you keep hidden

05:02.750 --> 05:04.333
finds its way to the surface.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.166
Did you rub poo
on your shirt?

05:06.208 --> 05:07.875
What? God, no,
it's cake.

05:07.917 --> 05:08.917
Poo cake?

05:08.959 --> 05:10.625
I'm putting poo cake
in your file.

05:10.667 --> 05:12.875
Wait, no. Is that
my permanent record?

05:12.917 --> 05:14.417
This is just a straw.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.917
Anyway, I usually do
eat cake before bed,

05:16.959 --> 05:18.250
but last night I didn't.

05:18.291 --> 05:21.041
And then you sleepwalked
to the kitchen and ate some.

05:21.083 --> 05:23.083
It's simple,
you're a man of habit.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.250
Just go back to
eating cake before bed

05:25.291 --> 05:26.667
and everything
will go back to normal.

05:26.709 --> 05:28.125
Okay, that makes sense.

05:28.166 --> 05:29.333
There ya go.

05:29.375 --> 05:31.083
Well, we've got
40 minutes left.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.375
You want to hold my feet
while I try to do a sit-up?

05:38.792 --> 05:40.959
Ah... forget it.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.875
Have you seen Rashes?

05:51.917 --> 05:53.500
Oh, I gave him to a family.

05:53.542 --> 05:55.709
Well, I-I guess you
could call them a family.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.000
There was a man,
he was like the father.

05:58.041 --> 06:00.834
There was no mom and no kids,
but a couple other men.

06:00.875 --> 06:02.041
So, like four dads.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.500
And they all worked
at a Korean restaurant.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.375
Mmm. What a sleep.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.458
Thank you, cake. Oh!

06:14.166 --> 06:15.417
Good, you're awake.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.667
Well, wait.
How did I get here?

06:17.709 --> 06:21.083
You came in the middle
of the night to answer our ad...

06:21.125 --> 06:22.709
and our prayers.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.792
Wait, ad for what?

06:23.834 --> 06:26.458
To be director of the orphanage!

06:26.500 --> 06:28.667
The orphans can't wait
to meet you.

06:28.709 --> 06:30.125
But I-I was sleepwalking.

06:30.166 --> 06:32.667
I thought maybe you were.

06:32.709 --> 06:34.500
But you're also
the only applicant

06:34.542 --> 06:35.625
who didn't play
with himself

06:35.667 --> 06:38.333
while he examined
the children's files.

06:45.417 --> 06:46.875
Well, I-I don't know
if I deserve this

06:46.917 --> 06:48.291
just for taking a job.

06:48.333 --> 06:51.458
Well... you did pay off
the loan on our bus.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.625
I what?!

06:54.458 --> 06:57.917
Huh, now, did I give you
any of my contact information?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.834
Like, like how to find me
if I were to suddenly disappear?

07:00.875 --> 07:01.959
Not yet.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.750
If you'd like to
come to my office--

07:06.500 --> 07:07.750
What is going on?!

07:07.792 --> 07:10.250
Why do you keep doing
nice things in your sleep?

07:10.291 --> 07:12.375
Because you're a nice man.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.875
That's why you adopted me...

07:15.917 --> 07:17.250
Daddy.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.333
Oh, no, what have I done?!

07:28.959 --> 07:30.750
Oh, thank God. It turned green.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.834
Are you sure
you need more coffee?

07:38.875 --> 07:40.417
You haven't slept in two days.

07:40.458 --> 07:41.458
I can't sleep.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.250
Who knows what
sleepwalking me will do.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.291
Probably something really nice.

07:45.333 --> 07:46.667
Hey, I'm nice, too.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.000
But in metered doses.

07:48.041 --> 07:50.208
The sleepwalking
version of me is too nice.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.792
He's like Michael Keaton nice.

07:51.834 --> 07:53.667
Michael Keaton?

07:53.709 --> 07:55.709
He didn't have to
pose for that picture.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.875
Honey, you're
all frazzled.

07:58.917 --> 08:00.792
You need some sleep.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.291
All right,
five-minute power nap.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.375
I'm setting an alarm,

08:03.417 --> 08:05.166
but don't let me sleep
a minute longer.

08:05.208 --> 08:06.834
Got it.

08:16.792 --> 08:19.500
"Dear Stan, I'll need
more than five minutes

08:19.542 --> 08:22.000
"to do all the good deeds
I have planned.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.834
So I drugged your coffee.
Night, night."

08:24.834 --> 08:26.041
What the hell?!

08:26.083 --> 08:27.458
Sleeping pills?!

08:27.500 --> 08:28.500
Was I sleepwalking?!

08:28.542 --> 08:29.875
And did you let me
put these pills

08:29.917 --> 08:30.959
in my own coffee?!

08:31.000 --> 08:31.917
And then let me drink it?!

08:31.959 --> 08:33.291
Yeah. It was exciting.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.709
What else do I have going on?

08:41.959 --> 08:43.709
What do you call
one of these places?

08:43.750 --> 08:45.041
Where we are now?

08:45.083 --> 08:47.041
A home?
No kiddin'!

08:47.083 --> 08:48.291
After you went back to sleep,

08:48.333 --> 08:50.834
you opened a soup kitchen
in our living room.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.375
We fed 50 people
today, Dad.

08:53.417 --> 08:55.583
Damn it.
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Dad.

08:55.625 --> 08:57.834
Next time,
we'll feed a hundred.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.083
Is anyone
peeing here?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.625
Yes.

09:05.041 --> 09:08.709
Smith, we've received word that
a Belgian terrorist is in town,

09:08.750 --> 09:10.083
and I want you to kill him.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.583
Smith, are you falling asleep?

09:12.625 --> 09:14.875
Ah, sorry, sir,
just a little tired.

09:14.917 --> 09:16.083
Oh, not to worry.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.917
I've got some cocaine
right here.

09:17.959 --> 09:20.083
But... i-isn't that illegal?

09:20.125 --> 09:24.458
Ah... okay. You think
cocaine is a problem.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.208
But I've done it for 32 years.

09:27.250 --> 09:30.959
See, I'm part of a group
of responsible cocaine users.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.125
We adhere to strict rules
to ensure things don't

09:34.166 --> 09:35.208
get out of control.

09:35.250 --> 09:36.291
Rules, sir?

09:36.333 --> 09:38.625
It's not used to feel good.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.041
Not for base pleasure,
certainly.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.083
It's a medicine
to improve our lives,

09:43.125 --> 09:45.542
like penicillin or opium.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.750
Uh, I-I think I'll just
get some shuteye.

09:47.792 --> 09:48.875
Of course, of course.

09:48.917 --> 09:51.125
Perhaps opium
is more your speed.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.458
See, I'm also part of a group
of responsible opium users.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.083
Actually, I'm just gonna
go do my mission.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.542
More for me, then.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.750
Would you mind locking my door
on the way out?

09:59.792 --> 10:01.291
Yes, sir.

10:06.041 --> 10:08.709
I can play the bass solo
to "My Generation."

10:08.750 --> 10:11.000

a home you built

10:38.083 --> 10:39.959
for Habitat
for Humanity.
Shh.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.834

we had a little chat.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.959
You see, I'm your conscience.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.417
You killed a hundred people,

anyone ever again.

everything I can

10:51.458 --> 10:53.375

13:40.625 --> 13:42.500
If you can't
bring yourself to kill,

14:41.583 --> 14:43.458
he's not going to
let you kill again.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.500
So, all you have to do
is kill someone

14:45.542 --> 14:47.792
and he'll realize you're
the one calling the shots

14:47.834 --> 14:49.667
and he'll have to
leave you alone forever.

14:49.709 --> 14:51.417

that terrorist.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.709

14:58.125 --> 14:59.208

14:59.250 --> 15:01.291
I suppose, but who can I kill?

15:01.333 --> 15:03.625
Well, just off
the top of my head,

15:03.667 --> 15:05.208
Jeff Watley.
Who's that?

15:05.250 --> 15:06.250
Real bad guy.

15:06.291 --> 15:07.333
Worst of the worst.

15:07.375 --> 15:08.333

15:11.667 --> 15:14.583
Got nabbed for sex trafficking
in Lower Manhattan

15:14.625 --> 15:15.583
right after 9/11.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.166
He was running a
kiddie porn ring,

15:17.208 --> 15:19.333
but before the Feds
could drop the net on him,

15:19.375 --> 15:21.458
he moved the whole
operation to Nova Scotia,

15:21.458 --> 15:23.166
where it's nice and legal.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.625
So, he's got it coming.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.000
Oh, it doesn't stop there.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.959
Guy starts moving drugs
between Nogales and Tucson.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.875
This case actually
goes to trial,

15:30.917 --> 15:33.000
but Benton was
on the bench, so...

15:33.041 --> 15:34.166
need I say more?

15:34.208 --> 15:35.709
Only if you want me
to understand.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.709
Okay. With this guy,
you're going to want

15:40.750 --> 15:42.875
to shoot him in the face
and ask questions later.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.542
Very bad person.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.834
All right, we're here.

stuff you said he did?

16:04.917 --> 16:05.917

16:05.959 --> 16:07.208
But it doesn't
change the fact

16:07.250 --> 16:08.458
that once you
kill this guy

16:08.500 --> 16:10.125
you'll be free
of your conscience.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.500
And I'll have
my vengeance.

16:11.542 --> 16:13.667

work like that.

had to kill?

16:25.917 --> 16:28.375
Well, the terrorist is
planning to blow up an IHOP.

sleepwalking Stan loves

and make sleepwalking Stan

16:35.458 --> 16:37.291
