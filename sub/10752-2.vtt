00:34.927 --> 00:36.922
So, how much are you asking for?

00:36.931 --> 00:38.682
Oh, nothing, just take
whatever you want.

00:38.691 --> 00:42.442
I don't want to start cluttering up
the place with old stuff, you know?

00:42.451 --> 00:46.302
That's what this new place is about,
I want to totally reinvent myself.

00:47.491 --> 00:51.282
From this moment on,
everything is going to be different.

00:51.291 --> 00:55.286
Hello, IT, have you tried
turning it off and on again?

00:55.811 --> 00:58.522
- I did it! I did it! I've been accepted!
- No!

00:58.531 --> 00:59.362
What's going on?

00:59.371 --> 01:01.882
I've been accepted!
I applied, they said yes!

01:01.891 --> 01:04.361
Who said yes?
What are you talking about...

01:04.370 --> 01:06.041
Moss, you're shaking!

01:06.050 --> 01:09.362
Consonant, please.

01:09.371 --> 01:11.362
B...

01:11.371 --> 01:12.962
And a vowel, please.

01:12.971 --> 01:15.602
And lastly, A.

01:15.611 --> 01:17.606
And here's the Countdown clock.

01:43.967 --> 01:46.441
All right,
let's see what we've got. Jeremy?

01:46.450 --> 01:48.201
Six.

01:48.210 --> 01:49.041
And Maurice?

01:49.050 --> 01:51.081
And Maurice?
Nine.

01:51.090 --> 01:52.881
Jeremy, what's your six?

01:52.890 --> 01:53.682
TENANT

01:53.691 --> 01:54.881
And Maurice?

01:54.890 --> 01:58.885
It actually already is a word...
TNETENNBA.

01:59.527 --> 02:03.121
Good heavens, really? Could you
use it in a sentence for us?

02:03.130 --> 02:07.125
Good morning,
that's a nice TNETENNBA.

02:07.246 --> 02:10.920
Someone reminded me, you haven't yet
got a word less than eight letters.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.042
It's extraordinary.

02:12.051 --> 02:14.321
You really do look
like you're on your way

02:14.330 --> 02:16.241
to winning that Countdown teapot.

02:18.130 --> 02:20.126
No offence, Jeremy.

02:43.126 --> 02:45.681
- Who are you?!
- Want me to do your windows?

02:45.690 --> 02:48.121
What?! What?!
I can't understand you.

02:48.130 --> 02:49.841
There we are, mate.

02:49.850 --> 02:50.881
No! No, no!

02:52.090 --> 02:54.081
Stop cleaning my windows!

02:54.090 --> 02:55.561
I want to go to the toilet.

02:55.570 --> 02:57.841
I don't know what you're saying.

02:57.850 --> 03:01.041
I did the window there and the...

03:01.050 --> 03:05.045
Yes, yes. Okey-dokey. I can't
understand what you're saying.

03:05.406 --> 03:07.521
Can I leave my bike
for a few minutes?

03:07.530 --> 03:11.525
Okay, then. All right, bye-bye.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.921
What are you doing?

03:14.930 --> 03:18.925
Why are you bringing the bike inside?
What? No! Where are you going?!

03:19.446 --> 03:22.041
Where are you going?

03:22.050 --> 03:24.720
Why do I have your bike?

03:24.729 --> 03:28.724
And, then, when he leaves, he just
leaves all of his stuff in my flat.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.121
What stuff?

03:30.130 --> 03:32.360
All his window cleaning bollocks,

03:32.369 --> 03:34.920
the ladder, bike, everything.
It's still there!

03:34.929 --> 03:36.281
What, in your flat?

03:36.289 --> 03:37.080
Yeah. He never came back.

03:37.089 --> 03:39.441
Yeah. He never came back.
How did he even get in?

03:39.450 --> 03:41.361
Well, he was very persuasive.

03:41.370 --> 03:45.365
I think. Well, I don't know how
to get in touch with this guy.

03:46.086 --> 03:50.085
His stuff is cluttering up my hallway.
I've had to start putting these up.

03:51.566 --> 03:55.080
My mum always says, you
should never open the door.

03:55.089 --> 03:56.680
What do you mean?

03:56.689 --> 03:58.360
An unopened door is a happy door.

03:58.369 --> 04:01.801
So we never answer ours
when someone knocks.

04:01.810 --> 04:03.641
What, so you all just sit there?

04:03.650 --> 04:05.120
Yes.

04:05.129 --> 04:08.041
So the doorbell goes
and you all just sit there...

04:08.050 --> 04:10.121
until the person goes away?

04:10.130 --> 04:11.600
Yes.

04:11.609 --> 04:13.400
What if it's important?
What if it's good news?

04:13.409 --> 04:15.921
This is London, Jen.
It's not someone with cake!

04:15.930 --> 04:19.399
Unless that cake is made
of dog poo and knives!

04:19.409 --> 04:23.240
Laters. I'm going to zone out at
the heads of department meeting.

04:23.249 --> 04:25.400
I thought you were
trying to avoid those.

04:25.409 --> 04:29.404
There's only so many times I can
say there's a RAM emergency.

04:40.685 --> 04:41.760
Hello?

04:41.769 --> 04:43.680
Yes?

04:43.689 --> 04:45.400
Hello. Can I come in?

04:45.409 --> 04:46.920
Why? What?

04:46.929 --> 04:48.640
Why do you want to come in?

04:48.649 --> 04:51.200
Isn't this the heads
of department meeting?

04:51.209 --> 04:53.320
Every Monday and Friday?
Or has it changed?

04:53.329 --> 04:56.760
No, no, yes, it is. You've
missed a few though, haven't you?

04:56.769 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, there was a RAM emergency.

04:59.009 --> 05:01.840
The...office had too much RAM.

05:01.849 --> 05:04.960
Okay, well you see the nature of
the meetings has changed somewhat

05:04.969 --> 05:08.240
and it wouldn't be fair on you.
There'd be a lot of catching up.

05:08.249 --> 05:09.600
Oh, okay!

05:09.609 --> 05:13.604
Okay! Thanks, Jen!

05:19.525 --> 05:23.524
They don't want me. They don't
want me at the Monday-Friday!

05:24.445 --> 05:25.800
I thought you hated those meetings?

05:25.809 --> 05:28.919
I did hate those meetings until they
didn't want me at those meetings.

05:28.928 --> 05:32.923
And now I love those meetings.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.759
Five minutes, Mr Moss.

05:36.768 --> 05:38.264
Thanks, Phil.

05:46.564 --> 05:48.919
A fan of tiny biscuits.

05:48.928 --> 05:52.320
You are full of surprises.

05:52.329 --> 05:53.880
Please, don't let me stop you.

05:53.889 --> 05:55.960
I like a man with appetite.

05:55.969 --> 05:58.440
It's what got you this far.

05:58.449 --> 06:00.799
Sorry, do I know you?

06:00.808 --> 06:02.120
They call me Prime.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.639
I had another name, once.

06:04.648 --> 06:08.643
I no longer go by it. Harold Tong.

06:10.644 --> 06:12.040
That's right.

06:12.049 --> 06:14.400
I won year 16 of Countdown.

06:14.409 --> 06:18.404
Yes, it was I who won
the 16th Countdown teapot.

06:18.604 --> 06:20.959
The teapot we all crave.

06:20.968 --> 06:22.919
You crave it too.

06:22.928 --> 06:24.799
Your eyes betray you.

06:27.008 --> 06:31.003
He has spirit, this one.

06:31.204 --> 06:35.203
But do you have the spirit to become
an ultimate champion, I wonder?

06:38.084 --> 06:41.159
Do you want to get a
photo together or something?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.599
I came only to give you this.

06:49.164 --> 06:53.163
What is it?

06:57.164 --> 06:58.039
Roy?

06:58.048 --> 07:00.959
Jesus! Alistair, hey!

07:00.968 --> 07:03.599
Long time no see!

07:03.608 --> 07:04.479
Yeah.

07:04.488 --> 07:06.839
Roy and I were at college together.

07:06.848 --> 07:09.839
Yeah. Wow, you are looking great!

07:09.848 --> 07:13.843
Thanks.

07:16.244 --> 07:17.879
So what are you up to these days?

07:17.888 --> 07:19.719
What am I up to? Wow. Big question.

07:19.728 --> 07:22.998
I'm the head writer
for Shotgun games? Do you know them?

07:23.007 --> 07:25.839
Yeah! Wow! Really?

07:25.848 --> 07:28.639
I play Shotgun games all the time.
They're brilliant.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.439
Oh, thank you.

07:30.448 --> 07:33.199
Wow, that is so cool.
Hey, you just won an award, right?

07:33.208 --> 07:37.202
Yes.

07:40.684 --> 07:43.158
Well, see you soon, Roy.

07:43.167 --> 07:46.918
Yes.

07:46.927 --> 07:50.922
Don't ask me what I'm
doing, you arrogant twat.

08:01.643 --> 08:05.278
Sorry, I'm not sure
I'm in the right place.

08:05.287 --> 08:08.998
Oh, you're in the right place,
Mr Moss. Welcome to Eight Plus.

08:25.483 --> 08:28.159
You came! I'm glad.

08:28.168 --> 08:31.398
That's Roger Black.
That's Steven Pawlin.

08:31.407 --> 08:33.158
You know your ex-Countdown winners.

08:33.167 --> 08:34.198
Why are they all here?

08:34.207 --> 08:37.558
Why, for someone who knows how to
add and subtract and multiply

08:37.567 --> 08:40.238
and divide lots of numbers to get
one other number,

08:40.246 --> 08:43.638
you're not so good at putting
two and two together, are you?

08:43.647 --> 08:46.118
This is Eight Plus!

08:46.127 --> 08:48.559
An exclusive club for those
gifted few

08:48.568 --> 08:51.758
who make it through
to eight episodes of Countdown.

08:51.767 --> 08:54.639
And you are our newest member.

08:54.648 --> 08:58.078
Oh, isn't that nice?

08:58.087 --> 09:02.082
Thanks for letting me know.
All right. All right. Bye.

09:02.163 --> 09:06.162
Does it not outrage you, Roy,
as a member of this IT department,

09:06.844 --> 09:10.038
that I, your head, is not being
represented at the Monday-Friday?

09:10.047 --> 09:13.758
Couldn't give a shit.
My neighbour just called.

09:13.767 --> 09:17.762
Turns out that window-washing Willie
from West Gibberish is not now going

09:19.643 --> 09:22.678
to be able to pick up his
window cleaning bric-a-brac.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.198
Why not?

09:24.207 --> 09:26.598
Oh, he was hit by a car or something.
Just my luck!

09:26.607 --> 09:29.438
You shouldn't have agreed to mind
it for him in the first place.

09:29.447 --> 09:32.318
Thanks, Jen. That's really helpful.
That's really good advice.

09:32.327 --> 09:34.478
That's exactly what I'll do.
In the past!

09:34.487 --> 09:38.198
When it happens again, last week.
I have to give it back to him!

09:38.207 --> 09:40.158
It can't just live in my hallway!

09:40.167 --> 09:44.162
Don't give a shit!

10:15.003 --> 10:16.278
No, no.

10:16.287 --> 10:19.757
Oh, no! No! No!

10:19.766 --> 10:23.761
Alistair! I'm not a window cleaner!

10:25.962 --> 10:29.837
Alistair!

10:29.846 --> 10:33.437
Alistair! I'm not a window cleaner.

10:33.446 --> 10:37.237
I'm not a window cleaner! Alistair!

10:37.246 --> 10:41.241
I'm not a window cleaner!

10:47.083 --> 10:49.357
All right, something weird
is going on in that room.

10:49.366 --> 10:51.157
They're wearing dressing gowns.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.157
Roy, will you listen to me?

10:53.166 --> 10:56.157
I don't have to listen to you.
I'm not married to you.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.677
I've got a lot on my mind
right now, Jen.

10:58.686 --> 11:00.797
This bloke thinks
I'm a window cleaner.

11:00.807 --> 11:01.957
Bloke I went to college with.

11:01.966 --> 11:05.158
He's doing amazingly...
The creature he was with.

11:05.166 --> 11:09.162
And he thinks that I am a
window cleaner. A window cleaner!

11:09.882 --> 11:12.237
What's wrong with that?
It's a noble profession.

11:12.246 --> 11:16.241
If your last profession
was cleaning balls!

11:16.722 --> 11:17.717
Google him.

11:17.726 --> 11:20.357
I've tried.
He has no online presence.

11:20.366 --> 11:24.277
Apparently people were being rude to
him so he suspended all his accounts.

11:24.286 --> 11:26.597
He's not on Friendface,
he's not on Chitter.

11:26.606 --> 11:27.437
Listen...

11:27.446 --> 11:29.197
How do people expect you to track
them down

11:29.206 --> 11:31.197
if they maintain no online presence!?

11:31.206 --> 11:34.197
You've both asked and answered
that question. What's going on up there?

11:34.206 --> 11:35.557
Is this meeting room five?

11:35.566 --> 11:37.837
You know, they soundproofed that
a few weeks ago?

11:37.846 --> 11:39.477
Really? What's that all about?

11:39.486 --> 11:42.317
Douglas said it was for
super secret meetings.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.597
But I want to go to
super secret meetings.

11:44.606 --> 11:47.276
I can't believe I might be
missing super secret meetings.

11:47.285 --> 11:49.877
But the dressing gowns.
Why are they wearing dressing gowns?

11:49.886 --> 11:51.077
Orgies!

11:51.086 --> 11:52.157
No.

11:52.166 --> 11:55.516
Maybe they're getting some kind of
executive massage treatment

11:55.525 --> 11:56.717
for being brilliant.

11:56.726 --> 11:58.357
Do you think they're
getting massages?

11:58.366 --> 12:01.276
If they're getting massages, I think
my human rights are being abused

12:01.285 --> 12:02.517
by themnot letting me in.

12:02.526 --> 12:05.077
Why don't you wear a towel,
hang around the door,

12:05.086 --> 12:06.357
and see if they let you in?

12:06.366 --> 12:08.277
I have my dignity, thank you, Moss.

12:08.286 --> 12:12.281
No. Hang on, that might just work!

12:20.022 --> 12:24.023
I can't believe you've joined
a swanky club. It's so showbizzy!

12:24.664 --> 12:27.740
Roy, the people here
see me in a certain way.

12:27.749 --> 12:31.301
It's perhaps not the way
I've been seen outside of the club.

12:31.310 --> 12:34.944
I'd just like you not to,
you know, mention it in any way...

12:34.953 --> 12:36.824
you know.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.344
Sure. Yeah.

12:38.353 --> 12:42.349
No problem.

13:05.719 --> 13:09.597
Hello, Terence. Glass of milk.
Straight up. Prime?

13:09.606 --> 13:11.076
Ribena for me.

13:11.085 --> 13:12.477
Roy?

13:12.486 --> 13:16.482
Oh, I'll have a beer. Thank you.

13:18.525 --> 13:20.360
Alcohol-free beer, surely?

13:20.369 --> 13:22.041
No.

13:22.050 --> 13:23.120
Get him what he wants.

13:23.129 --> 13:24.002
But...

13:24.011 --> 13:25.882
But...
Just get him what he wants.

13:25.891 --> 13:29.163
I'll have to go out.
Can somebody mind the bar?

13:29.172 --> 13:32.284
No. You know what? It's fine.
I shouldn't really be drinking

13:32.293 --> 13:36.290
during lunch. I'll just
have a coke. It's fine.

13:39.612 --> 13:41.567
Will I see you tonight?

13:41.576 --> 13:45.573
Not now, Ivana.

13:48.216 --> 13:50.572
Did you have sex with that lady?

13:50.581 --> 13:54.578
If you call that mindless
animalistic rutting sex, then yes,

13:54.818 --> 13:58.055
I suppose we did.

13:58.064 --> 13:59.655
That sounds like sex!

13:59.664 --> 14:03.660
Countdown Groupies are the most
sexually voracious of all groupies,

14:03.822 --> 14:05.217
and the most beautiful.

14:05.226 --> 14:08.137
I hear someone likes drinking beer.

14:09.507 --> 14:12.900
This is a private booth,
Negative One.

14:12.909 --> 14:15.101
Is that a name?!

14:15.110 --> 14:19.106
This is a private club, Word.

14:19.187 --> 14:20.783
Word! True dat!

14:20.792 --> 14:23.824
True dat, innit.

14:23.833 --> 14:27.829
My name is Word here.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.787
Roy, please.

14:30.796 --> 14:33.267
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Negative One.

14:33.276 --> 14:36.589
Heard you been catching
some nice letters.

14:36.598 --> 14:38.790
I get the same letters
as everyone else.

14:38.799 --> 14:41.631
Good when they fall
in the right order, though, innit?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.712
Steady, gentlemen.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.717
Boom!

14:47.758 --> 14:51.155
Don't mind him. Negative One
was quite proud of being

14:51.164 --> 14:55.160
our best speller
until Moss came along.

14:55.602 --> 14:59.602
Ah, our drinks.

15:00.123 --> 15:01.599
Can I just say...

15:01.608 --> 15:05.604
I am having a great time!

15:09.165 --> 15:11.242
Hey, y'all. Turn the music off.

15:11.251 --> 15:14.124
Turn the music off!

15:14.133 --> 15:17.885
What's he up to?

15:17.894 --> 15:21.891
Maybe our new champion would like to
test his skills out on the street.

15:23.932 --> 15:27.932
He's challenging you to a game of
Street Countdown. You cannot accept.

15:27.973 --> 15:30.529
It's too dangerous!

15:30.538 --> 15:33.130
Well, what do you say?

15:33.139 --> 15:36.092
Or is you worried
you is going to show yourself up

15:36.101 --> 15:38.092
in front of your girlfriend?

15:38.101 --> 15:40.813
He's calling Roy your girlfriend.

15:40.822 --> 15:44.818
Within the walls of Eight Plus,
that's a definite diss.

15:46.300 --> 15:50.301
You're lucky my "girlfriend"
has gone to the toilet.

15:51.582 --> 15:54.258
Is you going to answer me or what?

15:54.267 --> 15:56.619
No! We promised
those days were over.

15:56.628 --> 16:00.624
No more unlicensed
Street Countdown battles!

16:01.106 --> 16:03.022
I didn't arks you.

16:03.031 --> 16:07.028
I arksed him.

16:07.388 --> 16:09.664
Well?

16:09.673 --> 16:11.065
What is Street Countdown?

16:11.074 --> 16:15.071
It's more or less the same as normal
Countdown, except we play it on the street.

16:16.151 --> 16:18.187
That doesn't sound that dangerous.

16:18.196 --> 16:20.348
It can get quite cold.

16:20.357 --> 16:22.028
I always wear thermals.

16:22.037 --> 16:24.350
Ah, then you're probably fine.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.230
Hey, I is still standing here.

16:27.239 --> 16:28.791
What do you say, newbie?

16:28.800 --> 16:32.797
I came here
to drink milk and kick ass.

16:33.358 --> 16:36.633
And I've just finished my milk.

16:40.444 --> 16:44.440
Welcome to Street Countdown!

16:53.009 --> 16:55.602
First rule of Street Countdown

16:55.611 --> 16:59.563
is that you really must try and tell
as many people as possible about it.

16:59.572 --> 17:03.163
It's a rather fun game and the more
people we tell about it the better.

17:09.330 --> 17:11.287
What the f...?!

17:11.296 --> 17:12.968
Where is...everyone?

17:12.977 --> 17:16.848
Hello?

17:16.858 --> 17:18.970
Hello? Moss?

17:18.979 --> 17:22.974
Ivana?

17:33.500 --> 17:35.296
Hello?

17:35.305 --> 17:39.302
Hello in there!

17:42.425 --> 17:46.425
Oh, for f...!

17:49.746 --> 17:51.982
Oh, hey! Hey mate! Mate!

17:51.991 --> 17:55.987
Could you do me a favour?

17:59.431 --> 18:03.431
So do you just do big windows,
or do you do call outs?

18:03.592 --> 18:07.108
What, did you think I would
come round and do your house?

18:07.117 --> 18:11.114
No. No. Didn't think that.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.152
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

18:15.161 --> 18:18.193
Oh, hey!

18:18.202 --> 18:20.914
Alistair! Alistair!

18:20.922 --> 18:23.155
It's me!

18:23.164 --> 18:25.435
Alistair!

18:25.444 --> 18:28.476
I'm not a window cleaner!

18:28.485 --> 18:29.957
Hello?

18:29.966 --> 18:32.798
I'm not a window cleaner!

18:32.807 --> 18:35.519
I've got to go.

18:35.528 --> 18:37.280
I'm...

18:37.289 --> 18:40.521
I'm not a window cleaner!

18:40.530 --> 18:44.526
Oh, that bloke. He thinks
I'm a bloody window cleaner!

18:48.369 --> 18:51.965
Not that there's...

18:51.974 --> 18:55.971
It's a noble profession.

19:03.935 --> 19:07.935
Is this as fast as this goes? Yeah.

19:19.141 --> 19:21.216
Consonant.

19:21.225 --> 19:25.222
Vowel.

19:26.463 --> 19:28.139
Vowel. Boom!

19:28.148 --> 19:30.140
I'll take a further consonant.

19:30.149 --> 19:32.500
Consonant, you get me?

19:32.509 --> 19:34.582
I'll take a vowel this time.

19:34.591 --> 19:38.587
I'll have what he's having... vowel.

19:39.988 --> 19:42.224
I'll have another consonant.

19:42.233 --> 19:46.230
Give me one of dem sweet,
sweet consonants, you get me?

19:46.751 --> 19:50.187
I'll take a consonant,
plain and simple, thank you.

19:50.196 --> 19:53.708
I'll take an even sweeter vowel.

19:53.717 --> 19:56.590
I'll take a regular vowel, please.

19:56.599 --> 19:59.270
Yeah, I think...

19:59.279 --> 20:02.231
I think that's probably
enough letters, yeah?

20:02.240 --> 20:04.633
18 letters.

20:04.642 --> 20:07.994
I've never seen so many!

20:08.003 --> 20:09.754
He is the one.

20:09.763 --> 20:10.515
What happened to you?!

20:10.524 --> 20:13.756
Shh! This is the longest word
yet on Street Countdown.

20:13.765 --> 20:15.957
Unlike normal Countdown,
you see, what happens...

20:15.966 --> 20:17.957
I don't care.

20:24.045 --> 20:26.121
Negative One?

20:26.130 --> 20:27.602
12.

20:30.411 --> 20:32.843
Moss?

20:32.852 --> 20:34.404
16.

20:36.133 --> 20:38.005
Your word, Negative One?

20:38.014 --> 20:41.647
Enormousness.

20:41.656 --> 20:45.652
I shall give my answer, if I may,
in the form of a joke.

20:46.374 --> 20:48.529
This is most irregular.

20:48.538 --> 20:52.534
What do you call Negative One
sitting alone in an empty room?

20:52.776 --> 20:55.412
I don't know.
What do you call Negative One

20:55.421 --> 20:57.172
sitting alone in an empty room?

20:57.181 --> 21:00.454
Overnumerousness!

21:00.463 --> 21:01.694
Gyles?

21:01.703 --> 21:05.700
Yes, that is a word!
And the joke does make sense.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.065
Okay, let's go!

21:34.435 --> 21:35.866
Oh, yes!

21:35.875 --> 21:37.227
Shit.

21:37.236 --> 21:40.509
Five, six, seven...
Ah! Jen, you've joined us.

21:40.518 --> 21:42.029
Yes, yes, I have!

21:42.038 --> 21:43.510
You're not really dressed for it.

21:43.519 --> 21:47.392
Thought I'd wear normal clothes
and work up a real sweat.

21:47.401 --> 21:50.352
Hardcore. There's me thinking
you didn't have it in you.

21:50.361 --> 21:54.357
Right, now let's take it to the max.
Five, six, seven, eight.

22:44.098 --> 22:45.654
Hey! Hey, Alistair!

22:45.663 --> 22:48.375
Oh, God, I can't believe I got you!

22:48.384 --> 22:50.295
How you doing?

22:50.304 --> 22:52.856
Yeah, no, it's Roy. Yeah, hello.

22:52.865 --> 22:56.861
Listen, Alistair, I just wanted
to say, I'm not a window cleaner.

22:56.942 --> 22:59.458
No, no, I work in IT.

22:59.467 --> 23:02.820
Yeah, yeah, with computers
and all that.

23:02.829 --> 23:04.660
Macs?

23:04.669 --> 23:07.661
No, I really just
work with Windows.

23:08.971 --> 23:10.367
Hello?
