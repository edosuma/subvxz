02:48.627 --> 02:52.047
But, Norman, she has never
worked in her life before.

02:52.131 --> 02:53.549
I thought you'd be
sympathetic.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.050
I am sympathetic, but, please,

02:55.134 --> 02:57.052
why do I have to train her?

02:57.136 --> 02:59.180
Let her work in
someone else's section.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.140
She's willing
and needs the job.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.683
She's recently divorced.

03:02.766 --> 03:04.685
I'm a widow with four kids.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.187
Jerry should never
have died.

03:06.270 --> 03:10.232
I'd be better off.
I could've divorced him.

03:10.316 --> 03:11.984
Is that her?

03:12.067 --> 03:13.194
Yes.

03:13.277 --> 03:16.739
We're going to need
a special locker for the hat.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.409
This way.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.412
This is
quite a day for me.
I'll bet it is.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.707
I was so excited,
I left an hour early
so I wouldn't be late.

03:26.790 --> 03:31.921
It took 45 minutes
to find parking.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.048
We park inside the building.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.842
I just moved
to an apartment
near the airport.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.010
Ah.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.511
Hey, Violet,
what it is?

03:39.595 --> 03:40.679
Hi, Eddie.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.223
What do you hear
about your promotion?

03:42.306 --> 03:44.225
Nothing now.
Uh, Eddie Smith...

03:44.308 --> 03:45.684
Judy Bernly.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.186
Judy starts work today.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.479
What?

03:48.562 --> 03:52.483
How will I ever
get out of this
mail room prison

03:52.566 --> 03:54.485
if they keep hiring
from outside?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.987
Lady, you're going
to hate it here.

03:58.697 --> 03:59.740
Judy.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.243
Okay. Now, we're
on the 12th floor.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.245
Above us is
the executive suite,

04:04.328 --> 04:08.249
where the president,
Mr. Hinkle, is
and the chairman of the board.

04:08.332 --> 04:09.250
It sounds so big.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.252
It is.
I've been here 12 years.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.254
I've never even seen
the chairman of the board.

04:13.337 --> 04:17.257
12 years? All I've done
is be a housewife.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.760
I wanted to ask you
about my salary.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.263
That's a very
touchy subject
around here.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.265
You'll have
to take that up

04:24.348 --> 04:25.766
with our boss
Mr. Hart.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.269
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's all so new.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.271
You'll get
the hang of it.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.273
Then you'll really
be sorry.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.441
Come on.

04:37.361 --> 04:40.447
Well, welcome
to the front lines.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.789
Uh-oh. Here comes
General Patton.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.291
Violet, just a moment.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.458
Come on.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.960
Uh, just a moment.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.128
Violet?

04:54.211 --> 04:55.879
Oh, yes, Roz.
So sorry.

04:55.963 --> 05:00.301
I've been meaning to talk to you
about Mr. Hart's rules
on office decor.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.469
They seem to be getting
lax in your section.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.722
Really? How?

05:04.805 --> 05:06.223
I've typed it up here.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.225
"No coffee cups
on the desks.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.227
"No personal items
left in view‒

05:10.311 --> 05:11.395
"photos...

05:11.478 --> 05:12.896
plants, et cetera."

05:12.980 --> 05:16.066
We mustn't look
cluttered or sloppy.
Mm-mmm.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.151
An office that...

05:17.234 --> 05:19.528
looks efficient
is efficient,
looks efficient
is efficient,

05:19.611 --> 05:21.488
as Mr. Hart says.
As Mr. Hart says.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.323
Oh, hello.

05:22.406 --> 05:26.535
Judy Bernly, Roz Keith,
Mr. Hart's administrative
assistant.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.746
Judy is starting
today.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.247
It's nice to meet you.

05:30.331 --> 05:33.250
Welcome to Consolidated.
I hope you enjoy it.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.752
We're all
a happy bunch.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.253
I think so.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.255
Put this
on the bulletin board.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.758
I know just where
to stick it.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.345
Judy, if there's
anything I can do
to help you settle in,

05:44.428 --> 05:47.931
just drop on by.
Thank you.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.270
One thing you should know
about dear Roz‒

05:53.354 --> 05:55.564
she's the eyes, ears, nose,
and throat of Mr. Hart.

05:55.647 --> 05:59.777
Anything she hears,
he hears.
She's a company spy?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.278
Shh! I wouldn't say that.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.697
If you gossip
in the ladies' room,

06:03.781 --> 06:06.200
check under the stalls
for her shoes.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.701
Happy birthday, Myra.

06:07.785 --> 06:09.703
She and Roz
are like this.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.705
This section's
divided into three zones,

06:11.789 --> 06:13.207
each with a supervisor.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.210
As senior,
the other two supervisors
report to me.

06:16.293 --> 06:20.339
I report to Mr. Hart.
That's his office there.
He was just made vice president.

06:20.422 --> 06:24.051
I've never seen anyone
leapfrog so fast.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.929
I have the bad back
to prove it.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.515
Margaret, anything serious?

06:29.598 --> 06:31.058
Nothing so far.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.226
Uh-huh.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.728
Margaret, please.
Roz is on my case.

06:34.812 --> 06:35.938
Sorry.

06:36.021 --> 06:39.400
I remember
when he was just
a management trainee.

06:39.483 --> 06:42.403
In fact, I'm the one
who trained him.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.738
What's he like?

06:47.825 --> 06:49.785
I like to think, Judy,

06:49.868 --> 06:51.787
if there is a word

06:51.870 --> 06:54.331
to describe my philosophy
of business...

06:55.499 --> 06:57.709
it's "teamwork."

06:57.793 --> 07:01.463
Everybody
working together.

07:01.547 --> 07:04.675
You girls, of course,
never got a chance
to play football

07:04.758 --> 07:06.218
or baseball.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.221
And I've always felt
like that's unfortunate

07:09.304 --> 07:12.724
because I think it's‒
it's probably
the best place

07:12.808 --> 07:15.769
to learn what teamwork
is all about.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.689
I remember Coach Frye
used to tell us

07:18.772 --> 07:22.818
"a chain is only as strong
as its weakest link."

07:25.320 --> 07:28.699
Its weakest link‒
God damn it!

07:29.825 --> 07:31.076
Get this chair fixed.

07:31.160 --> 07:36.582
Well, I...
I'm not going to bore you
with a long harangue.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.585
Just suffice to say that
it's a jungle out there,

07:39.668 --> 07:41.086
but if we work together,

07:41.170 --> 07:43.464
we'll cut the balls off
the competition

07:43.547 --> 07:46.800
and be sitting pretty
on top of the hill.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.806
Thank you, sir.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.558
I'm happy
to be working here.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.059
Well, you're
a welcome addition,

07:56.143 --> 07:59.021
and a damn pretty one, too,
if I might add.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.397
Thank you, sir.
I mean that.

08:00.481 --> 08:03.317
You should see the crones
coming through here lately.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.943
Real pathetic.
Right, Violet?

08:06.278 --> 08:08.614
Oh, Violet,
my wife's coming by later.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.616
I'd like to get her
a present.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.493
Could you pick out a scarf?

08:12.576 --> 08:14.036
We've discussed
this before.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.663
It's not my place
to shop‒

08:16.747 --> 08:18.665
God damn it.
For five minutes

08:18.749 --> 08:20.167
I've been talking
about teamwork.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.336
You're not there
for the hand-off.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.879
All I'm saying,
Mr. Hart,

08:23.962 --> 08:25.881
is my job description
says nothing

08:25.964 --> 08:28.300
about making
purchases
for your wife.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.303
All I'm saying is
I like people around me

08:31.386 --> 08:33.304
who are flexible
and get along.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.806
When I ask an employee,

08:34.890 --> 08:37.433
especially one who wants
to be promoted to management,

08:37.518 --> 08:38.936
I expect
a little cooperation.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.102
You savvy?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.270
Savvy.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.774
Good. Silk, blue,
maybe a red stripe.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.276
You're talking
to the right person.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.778
Violet's the best.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.279
First person I met here.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.281
Knows more about
what's going on

08:51.365 --> 08:53.450
than anybody
but Mr. Hinkle.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.369
Oh, a deer.

08:55.452 --> 08:56.912
Yeah. Lucky shot.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.914
Listen, if you ever
have anything

08:58.997 --> 09:01.416
of a serious nature
on your mind,

09:01.500 --> 09:03.377
feel free
to talk to me,

09:03.460 --> 09:06.880
because that's actually
why I have my office
on this floor‒

09:06.964 --> 09:09.383
to be close to my girls.
Okay?

09:09.466 --> 09:10.884
Certainly. Thank you.

09:10.968 --> 09:11.969
Good.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.180
Oh, is Doralee
back yet?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.517
No.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.018
Get me coffee
then, Violet.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.396
No sugar.
Just Skinny and Sweet.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.647
Yes, sir.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.947
Well, that's
Franklin Hart, Jr.

09:32.030 --> 09:35.033
But to me
he'll always be
F. Hart.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.412
Oh, good.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.663
She's back.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.125
Hi, Violet.
How's everything going?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.793
Oh, Doralee,
your boss wants coffee.

09:44.876 --> 09:48.297
Great. I just got back
from gassing up his car.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.340
I'm filling one tank
or another.

09:50.424 --> 09:51.842
This is Judy Bernly.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.344
Judy will be working
in my section.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.846
Doralee Rhodes.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.347
Nice to meet you.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.266
Hope everybody's been
treating you friendly

09:59.349 --> 10:00.809
and showing you around.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.811
Everybody's been
very nice, thank you.

10:02.894 --> 10:05.814
If there's anything
I can do, just holler.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.442
I know what it's like
to be the new girl.

10:08.525 --> 10:10.110
Thank you.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.781
Judy, over here.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.784
This is your typewriter,
Dictaphone, adding machine.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.704
I better get you
a locker for that hat.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.596
Hello.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.222
Hello.

10:40.724 --> 10:41.808
Uh...

10:41.892 --> 10:42.809
yes.

10:44.061 --> 10:45.187
Hello?

10:51.735 --> 10:54.529
Jo's leaving.
They won't let her
work part-time.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.991
Of course they won't.
It would make things
too convenient.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.827
Hi, Violet. Hi, Judy.
How's it going?

11:00.911 --> 11:02.245
Fine, thank you.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.748
Violet's going to show me
around outside.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.751
Hart's asked me
to buy his wife a scarf.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.420
Why doesn't he ask
Doralee?

11:10.504 --> 11:12.923
She does
everything else for him.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.424
Oh, she's too tired.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.678
They've been
in conference together
all morning.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.179
We'll see you later.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.681
Come on, Judy.

11:20.764 --> 11:21.848
Have fun.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.017
Your salmon
looks good. Mmm!

11:24.101 --> 11:25.185
$20?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.687
I like this.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.690
What did Margaret mean
about Doralee?

11:29.773 --> 11:32.693
Well, rumor has it
that, uh...

11:32.776 --> 11:34.695
she is banging the boss.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.781
She and Mr. Hart?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.282
I think that's awful.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.284
Well, live
and let live.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.287
Though, frankly,
I credit her
with more brains.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.789
Certainly more taste.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.290
That's how
my husband left.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.293
He was having an affair
with his secretary.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.296
I don't think Hart
will leave his wife.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.799
She's been
too good a meal ticket
all these years.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.927
Besides, she's bananas.
She adores him.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.561
Doralee, would you
grab your pad

12:07.644 --> 12:10.397
and bring your pretty face
in here, please?

12:10.480 --> 12:12.149
Yes, sir.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.745
Hold it right there.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.079
What?

12:27.330 --> 12:29.249
Turn around
just a second.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.001
Something wrong?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.254
Have I got something
on my dress?

12:34.337 --> 12:35.255
Nothing's wrong.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.299
Matter of fact,
everything is...

12:37.382 --> 12:38.884
very, very right.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.555
Shall we begin,
Mr. Hart?

12:43.638 --> 12:44.723
Yeah. Um...

12:44.806 --> 12:47.851
take a letter
to Vernon Henshaw

12:47.934 --> 12:50.061
over at Metropolitan Mutual.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.106
Dear Vern,

12:53.190 --> 12:54.608
as you know,

12:54.691 --> 12:57.778
the chairman of the board
of Consolidated Companies,

12:57.861 --> 13:00.030
Mr. Russell Tinsworthy,

13:00.113 --> 13:02.783
spends most of his time
in Brazil

13:02.866 --> 13:07.204
working on the jungle
clearance operation.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.955
Consequent‒

13:09.039 --> 13:10.499
Oh, the pencils dropped.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.084
It's all right.
I'll get it.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.380
Here, let me...

13:17.464 --> 13:20.383
Let me‒
Let me help you
with those.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.886
That's okay, really.
I've got them.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.180
There you go.
Okay.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.767
Doralee.
Yes?

13:28.850 --> 13:30.894
About my conduct
in the office here
yesterday...

13:30.977 --> 13:35.065
I'm afraid I got
a little carried away. I'd...

13:35.148 --> 13:37.567
I'd just like
to apologize to you.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.069
Don't you worry
about it.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.321
I've been chased
by swifter men than you,

13:41.404 --> 13:43.365
and I ain't
been caught yet.

13:43.448 --> 13:47.077
Shall we get back
to our letter now?

13:47.160 --> 13:51.081
But could you just
come over here
for a second?

13:51.164 --> 13:53.333
I have a little
something for you.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.211
You know...

13:56.294 --> 13:57.754
ever since I made
that stupid mistake

13:57.838 --> 14:00.674
about the convention
in San Francisco, I...

14:00.757 --> 14:02.676
Oh, you didn't
make a mistake.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.177
I'll just have to make sure

14:04.261 --> 14:07.681
the next time I'm asked
to work at a convention,

14:07.764 --> 14:09.432
there's a convention
going on.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.687
Right. And nothing happened anyway,
so let's forget the whole thing.

14:13.770 --> 14:14.896
Fine.

14:14.980 --> 14:18.024
Doralee...

14:18.108 --> 14:20.235
you know, you mean
so much more to me

14:20.318 --> 14:22.529
than just a dumb secretary,

14:22.612 --> 14:24.573
so I bought this for you.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.074
I picked it out myself.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.868
Well, thank you.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.746
You didn't have
to do that.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.748
Oh, it's nice.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.334
It's very nice.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.461
It's also very nothing.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.963
Doralee, I'm a rich man.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.507
I've got a checkbook
on that desk.

14:42.591 --> 14:45.510
Say the word,
you can write
your own figure.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.012
I could do that now.

14:47.095 --> 14:49.389
I sign your name
better than you do.

14:49.472 --> 14:53.143
Doralee,
don't you understand?
I'm crazy about you.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.811
You're all I think about.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.981
I've told you before.
I'm a married woman.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.526
And I'm a married man.
That makes it perfect.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.944
Oh, Mr. Hart‒ Aah!

15:03.028 --> 15:04.446
Doralee, please!
I want you.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.947
Oh, for heaven's sake.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.241
What are you doing,
Mr. Hart?

15:08.325 --> 15:09.618
Call me Frank.

15:10.660 --> 15:11.745
Frank?

15:11.828 --> 15:12.996
Huh?

15:13.079 --> 15:15.707
What are you doing
on the floor?

15:15.790 --> 15:17.208
Nothing. I tripped.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.712
Hit my knee
on the damn
coffee table.

15:20.795 --> 15:21.880
Ow! Oh!

15:21.963 --> 15:23.381
Did you hurt yourself?

15:23.465 --> 15:24.549
No.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.551
What are you
doing down here?

15:26.635 --> 15:29.554
You know I hate it
when you come here.

15:29.638 --> 15:31.056
You know that.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.557
Don't be mad at me.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.476
I just came
from the travel agency.

15:34.559 --> 15:37.062
They have the most
wonderful cruises‒

15:37.145 --> 15:38.563
Oh, hello, Doralee.

15:38.647 --> 15:40.231
Hi, Mrs. Hart.
Well, how are you?

15:40.315 --> 15:43.360
I'm fine, and you?
What a lovely scarf.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.571
It's a present
from your husband.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.074
Oh, Frank,
that was so thoughtful.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.076
I'm just glad
he appreciates you.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.994
Put it on.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.541
Oh, it's absolutely
adorable.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.086
And you are so attractive.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.546
You're sweet.
I appreciate that.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.548
Doralee,
that'll be all for now.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.717
You can just finish
the letter later on.

16:07.801 --> 16:11.388
Bye. Oh, Frank,
let me show you
these brochures.

16:11.471 --> 16:16.059
It won't take a second.
You did promise to go.
Right.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.270
Here's a lovely one.
An Italian line.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.272
Looks just like
the <i>Love Boat.</i>

16:21.356 --> 16:22.440
It does.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.819
Four weeks of sunshine.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.405
Four weeks? Are you
out of your mind?

16:28.488 --> 16:30.115
I'm not spending
four weeks of my life

16:30.198 --> 16:32.826
drifting around
on that dago boat.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.251
Well, I'll be damned.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.587
Just look and see
who got paid off
for services rendered.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.589
That's‒That's the scarf
you bought.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.678
Aw, who cares?
I suppose
she deserves it.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.222
I'll bet you
can't wait to see
the Xerox room.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.144
Now, all these rush memos
are always done

16:59.227 --> 17:00.812
on regulation
Consolidated letterhead,

17:00.895 --> 17:04.773
so you place it in here,
8 1/2 X 11.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.694
Close the bin firmly,
turn on the power.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.365
Several people
have lost their hearing
in this room!

17:12.449 --> 17:14.409
Select the number
of copies,

17:14.492 --> 17:16.411
make this a little darker,

17:16.493 --> 17:18.121
and start the print.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.622
Here it comes.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.125
If anything goes wrong,
watch this panel.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.627
The machine tells you
what to do.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.128
I'll leave you to it.

18:13.802 --> 18:14.886
Oh!

18:39.828 --> 18:41.246
You're too much.

18:41.329 --> 18:44.457
Your wife's going off
on vacation. There'll be
no stopping you.

18:44.541 --> 18:48.837
I know. Wait till you hear
this new little
scheme I've got going.

18:50.004 --> 18:52.423
Come on in here
a minute.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.763
What the hell
is going on here?

19:01.057 --> 19:02.392
I'm sorry, Mr. Hart.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.810
It was going too fast.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.855
Why didn't you just
shut it off right here?

19:06.938 --> 19:09.274
Catch you upstairs, Frank.
Great little scheme
you got here.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.067
Right here. Right here.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.278
I'm sorry, Mr. Hart.
I thought
I could keep up.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.822
Weren't you
checked out
on this machine?

19:15.905 --> 19:18.992
Any moron could
operate this.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.535
I was.

19:20.618 --> 19:23.037
I know what to do
now, sir.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.539
I suggest
you do it,

19:24.622 --> 19:26.416
or your first day
will be your last,
understand?

19:26.499 --> 19:29.085
Yes, sir.
Clean this mess up
and get back to work.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.920
Yes, sir.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.166
Dick?

20:09.250 --> 20:10.793
Oh, Judy.

20:13.046 --> 20:14.881
What are you doing here?

20:14.964 --> 20:18.718
I just dropped by to
give you these papers.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.264
They're the last.

20:23.348 --> 20:24.766
You, uh, you sign them,

20:24.849 --> 20:27.769
and then you give them
to your lawyer.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.145
Okay.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.399
How are things with you?

20:34.359 --> 20:35.443
Everything's fine.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.611
Terrific!

20:36.694 --> 20:38.279
I got a job.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.447
Oh!

20:39.530 --> 20:40.573
I'm a...

20:40.657 --> 20:42.492
I'm a secretary.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.663
Well, how's Liza?

20:46.746 --> 20:49.165
Fine. She's waiting in the car.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.711
We‒We've got to go.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.341
Well, so long.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.135
Bye.

21:24.534 --> 21:28.496
I feel like I was
just here a minute ago.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.498
You'll get
used to it.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.666
Everybody does.

21:31.749 --> 21:32.875
Eventually.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.224
Medicinal purposes.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.395
Violet Newstead,
please hold.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.896
Violet Newstead,
please hold.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.398
Hi, this is Violet.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.401
Mel, no, no.
That's 210, net 30.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.902
Delivered in 9 days.

21:59.986 --> 22:04.407
That's 2% of 4,405.50 is...

22:04.490 --> 22:05.575
88.11.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.827
Oh, my pleasure, Mel.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.580
Violet Newstead,
please hold.
Hi, this is Violet.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.165
Charlotte,
I've got it right here.

22:12.248 --> 22:16.252
I was waiting for your call.
That route is...

22:16.336 --> 22:20.340
32 via Dixie Express.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.383
Don't worry.
I've got it under control.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.760
Okay. Bye-bye.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.094
Violet News‒
Come on, kids.

22:25.178 --> 22:28.181
No fighting.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.225
Believe me. There's more than one
peanut butter and banana
sandwich in the world.

22:31.309 --> 22:34.270
What did I say this morning?
Okay. Love you, too.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.273
No, I don't want to talk
to the dog. Bye-bye.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.112
Oh, hi, Judy.
How's everything going?

22:43.196 --> 22:45.198
Fine, thanks.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.783
How'd you like to have
lunch today?

22:46.866 --> 22:48.785
Well, I'm afraid
I can't, thanks.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.952
Maybe tomorrow.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.455
I know the cutest
little Italian restaurant

22:52.538 --> 22:55.458
just a hop, skip,
and a jump from here.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.460
I should stay
in the office

22:57.543 --> 22:58.961
and learn
the routine,

22:59.045 --> 23:00.213
but thanks anyway.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.256
Yeah, sure.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.059
You know, I just
don't get it, Dwayne.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.394
What's that, honey?

23:14.477 --> 23:18.898
I'm as nice
as I know how to be
to everyone at that office.

23:18.981 --> 23:23.277
Everybody treats me
like a bastard
at a family reunion.

23:23.361 --> 23:25.780
Well, come over here
and sit down.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.366
Well, that hurts my feelings.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.284
Where's my smile?
I don't have one.

23:30.368 --> 23:33.079
They're just jealous
'cause you're so pretty.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.580
They're not jealous.

23:34.664 --> 23:35.748
Mm-hmm.

23:35.832 --> 23:37.250
Now, where's my smile?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.252
I want you to smile, okay?

23:39.335 --> 23:41.504
You forget
all about them.

23:41.587 --> 23:45.007
I'm going to give you
a real warm reception.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.009
I just bet you will.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.889
Violet, a little coffee.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.308
Yes, sir.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.498
Yeah. What else?

24:17.582 --> 24:20.960
Did you have a chance
to look at the report
on color-coding of accounts?

24:21.043 --> 24:23.463
Last month.
I gave it to you.

24:23.546 --> 24:26.174
We could improve
efficiency 20%.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.675
Sure, I looked
into that.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.177
That needs
a little work.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.761
I'll get back
to you on that.

24:30.845 --> 24:33.598
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Okay.

24:39.729 --> 24:40.771
Oh, Violet,

24:40.855 --> 24:42.607
I haven't heard
from you.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.233
Did you get
my memo?

24:44.317 --> 24:46.652
I did, Roz.
I tore right through it.

24:46.736 --> 24:47.653
Good.

24:47.737 --> 24:49.655
We must
clamp down hard

24:49.739 --> 24:51.657
on any signs
of unionization.

24:51.741 --> 24:55.286
Oh, here comes Mr. Hart
with Mr. Hinkle.

24:55.369 --> 24:58.122
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.624
Hello, girls.
How's it going?

24:59.707 --> 25:00.625
Just fine.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.168
Hello, Mr. Hinkle.

25:02.251 --> 25:06.714
Roz, you'll be getting
a copy of this report
Frank just gave me.

25:06.797 --> 25:10.551
We're going to start
color-coding the accounts
from now on.

25:10.635 --> 25:13.554
Frank's done
a brilliant study
with efficiency.

25:13.638 --> 25:17.099
Really?
Congratulations,
Mr. Hart.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.059
Thanks, Roz.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.061
Was just‒just brilliant.

25:20.144 --> 25:22.688
You're a fine piece
of manpower, Frank.

25:22.772 --> 25:26.317
Any other reforms
you want to make
are fine with me.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.318
Thank you.

25:27.401 --> 25:28.736
This is your floor.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.072
You run it
as you please.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.156
Going up?

25:32.240 --> 25:34.450
No. We're going down.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.080
Oh, I can't believe
that man.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.581
He has no shame.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.251
He stood right there
and presented my idea

25:43.334 --> 25:44.752
to the company's
president

25:44.835 --> 25:46.254
like it was his own.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.755
Why didn't you
call him on it?

25:47.838 --> 25:50.591
Oh, because
I'm playing it safe, damn it.

25:50.675 --> 25:54.595
In six weeks,
he makes the decision
about that promotion,

25:54.679 --> 25:57.431
and until then,
I'm playing
the good girl.

25:57.515 --> 25:58.766
You finished
up there?

25:58.849 --> 25:59.767
Yeah.

25:59.850 --> 26:00.768
Nice job.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.228
Thanks.

26:02.311 --> 26:05.231
Can you imagine
a mature woman
with four kids

26:05.314 --> 26:07.066
installing
a garage door opener,

26:07.149 --> 26:09.569
he still refers to me
as his girl.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.737
Mom, you gotta relax.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.240
I'm going to
roll you a joint.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.742
Josh, you know how
I feel about that.

26:16.826 --> 26:19.245
Besides, your grandmother
will pitch a fit

26:19.328 --> 26:21.747
if she even hears you
mention marijuana.

26:21.831 --> 26:24.250
She doesn't understand
moderation.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.752
Besides, you're
the one that keeps
talking about

26:26.836 --> 26:28.754
"harm springs
from excess," right?

26:28.838 --> 26:30.256
Okay. Yes, I know.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.258
I'm talking
about one joint.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.760
Okay.
I don't like it, Josh.

26:34.844 --> 26:38.264
How long have you
been waiting
for this promotion?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.766
Slip it in my purse.

26:40.850 --> 26:41.767
It works!

26:41.851 --> 26:43.102
You did it.

26:49.442 --> 26:50.443
What?

26:50.526 --> 26:52.612
Don't go flying
off the handle.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.406
You gave that promotion
to Bob Enright?

26:55.489 --> 26:57.950
I've got five years
seniority over him.

26:58.034 --> 26:58.951
I know.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.119
Christ,
I trained him.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.413
I know, but see,
the company‒

27:02.496 --> 27:03.873
Oh, the company,
bullshit.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.459
You promoted him.
You tell me why.

27:06.542 --> 27:10.254
Well, in the first place,
Bob does have
a college degree.

27:10.338 --> 27:11.255
Oh, brilliant.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.049
While he's
away at college

27:13.132 --> 27:14.550
getting
his useless degree,

27:14.634 --> 27:16.427
I'm working
my butt off.

27:16.510 --> 27:19.430
In the second place,
he's supporting a family.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.723
And I don't?

27:20.806 --> 27:23.225
What's that
got to do
with anything?

27:23.309 --> 27:24.560
My hands are tied.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.896
The company needs
a man in this position.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.565
Clients would rather
deal with men
about figures.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.233
Now we're getting at it.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.236
I lose a promotion
because of some
idiot prejudice.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.155
The boys in the club
are threatened,

27:36.238 --> 27:39.659
and you're
intimidated by any woman that
won't sit at the back of the bus.

27:39.742 --> 27:42.244
Spare me the women's
lib crap, okay?

27:42.328 --> 27:44.413
I know your feelings.
I understand.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.415
You understand zilch.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.918
I understand
I'm still the boss here,

27:49.001 --> 27:50.920
and though you
have your value,

27:51.003 --> 27:53.589
you better get
hold of yourself.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.091
God damn it.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.592
Doralee, get in here!

27:56.676 --> 27:57.593
Okay.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.595
I told you
to have this chair fixed.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.430
Okay,
I'm going to leave,

28:01.514 --> 28:03.516
but I'm telling you
one thing‒

28:03.599 --> 28:06.936
Don't you ever
refer to me as
your girl again.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.688
What are you
talking about?

28:09.772 --> 28:11.691
Doralee,
what's with this chair?

28:11.774 --> 28:13.192
I'll tell you‒

28:13.275 --> 28:15.361
I'm no girl.
I'm a woman.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.487
You hear?

28:16.570 --> 28:19.198
I'm not your wife
or your mother...

28:19.281 --> 28:20.700
or even
your mistress.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.535
What?

28:22.618 --> 28:24.036
I am your employee,

28:24.120 --> 28:27.540
and as such,
I expect to be treated equally,

28:27.623 --> 28:30.793
with a little dignity
and a little respect.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.045
What do you mean,
mistress?

28:33.129 --> 28:34.505
She's just upset.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.340
Doralee, the whole
company knows

28:36.424 --> 28:38.551
you two are
having an affair.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.886
Who's been saying
we're having an affair?

28:40.970 --> 28:42.388
Who's been saying it?

28:42.471 --> 28:43.764
He has.

28:46.308 --> 28:47.351
What?

28:49.812 --> 28:51.897
Violet, where
are you going?

28:51.981 --> 28:53.566
I'm going
to get drunk.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.901
Atta girl.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.403
You've been
telling everybody

28:57.486 --> 28:59.238
I'm sleeping
with you, huh?

28:59.321 --> 29:01.240
Well, that's why
these people

29:01.323 --> 29:02.700
treat me
like some floozy.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.744
They think
I'm screwing the boss.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.746
That's not it at all‒

29:06.829 --> 29:08.706
You just love it,
don't you?

29:08.789 --> 29:10.583
Gives you some
cheap thrill,

29:10.666 --> 29:12.084
like knocking over
pencils‒

29:12.168 --> 29:13.502
Let's don't get exc‒

29:13.586 --> 29:15.713
Get your
scummy hands off me.

29:15.796 --> 29:18.090
I've been
straight with you
since I got here.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.885
I put up with
your pinching

29:20.968 --> 29:22.386
'cause I need this job,

29:22.470 --> 29:24.388
but this is
the last straw!

29:24.472 --> 29:25.848
Let's just‒

29:25.931 --> 29:28.309
I got a gun
in my purse.

29:28.392 --> 29:32.229
I've been forgiving
because of the way
I was brought up,

29:32.313 --> 29:35.232
but if you ever say
another word about me

29:35.316 --> 29:36.734
or make another
indecent proposal,

29:36.817 --> 29:38.235
I'll get that gun,

29:38.319 --> 29:41.822
and I'll change you
from a rooster to a hen
with one shot!

29:42.823 --> 29:45.242
Don't think
I can't do it!

29:49.163 --> 29:50.289
Shit.

29:54.502 --> 29:55.753
Where are you going?

29:55.836 --> 29:57.588
I need a drink, Roz.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.257
I'm taking the rest
of the day off.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.927
Atta girl.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.264
What do you want?
I'm busy.

30:07.348 --> 30:10.267
I wouldn't
disturb you if this
weren't important,

30:10.351 --> 30:12.770
but I just heard
one of the girls

30:12.853 --> 30:14.271
commit a serious
infraction.

30:14.355 --> 30:15.314
What?

30:15.397 --> 30:17.775
Maria Delgado
was speaking
to a girl

30:17.858 --> 30:19.610
whose voice
I didn't recognize

30:19.693 --> 30:22.613
when I overheard her
reveal her salary

30:22.696 --> 30:26.075
and make estimates
of yours and mine.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.828
Get rid of her.
Dismiss her.

30:28.911 --> 30:31.497
It isn't as if
she hasn't
been warned.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.957
I clearly outlined‒

30:33.040 --> 30:34.291
Did you hear me?

30:34.375 --> 30:36.168
Fire the bitch.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.795
What?

30:37.878 --> 30:39.296
I don't believe it.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.090
You were fired for that?

30:41.173 --> 30:42.341
That's okay.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.302
I wanted to spend
more time with
my kids anyway.

30:45.386 --> 30:46.971
But it's so unfair.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.348
We've got to
do something.

30:49.431 --> 30:51.267
Sure. Let's all revolt.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.811
No. Don't you get
in trouble for me.

30:53.894 --> 30:55.145
It's not worth it.

30:55.229 --> 30:57.648
I'll find another job.

30:57.731 --> 31:01.652
It was hard for me
to work full-time
anyway.

31:02.820 --> 31:05.239
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.240
Oh...

31:06.323 --> 31:07.616
Where's Violet?

31:07.700 --> 31:08.909
Does she know?

31:08.993 --> 31:11.537
Not yet.
She's at Charlie's
getting drunk.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.581
Well, I'm going to
tell her.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.624
This is a disgrace.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.668
Atta girl.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.604
What a rat.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.772
What a liar.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.608
What a creep.

31:40.691 --> 31:44.445
To think he told everybody
I was sleeping with him.

31:44.528 --> 31:45.946
It's so unfair.

31:46.030 --> 31:48.365
Just so unfair.

31:49.700 --> 31:53.162
Twelve years of service,
and he shoots me down.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.290
We've got
to do something.

31:56.373 --> 31:58.959
He can't just treat
people like that.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.878
Do? What's to do, quit?

32:00.961 --> 32:02.254
Well, I can't quit.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.590
It's the same
all over, anyway.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.092
Couldn't we all
get together and...

32:07.176 --> 32:08.093
and complain?

32:08.177 --> 32:09.428
Complain to who?

32:09.511 --> 32:10.763
Let's face it‒

32:10.846 --> 32:12.765
We're in
a pink collar ghetto.

32:12.848 --> 32:14.099
Let's have another drink.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.434
This one's on me.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.936
I've got it.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.437
It's my turn.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.272
I've really got it.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.273
What's that?

32:21.357 --> 32:23.275
I didn't think
you smoked.

32:23.359 --> 32:24.777
You roll your own?

32:24.860 --> 32:27.446
This is a gift
from my son.

32:27.529 --> 32:30.282
Let's pop to
the ladies' room
and light up.

32:30.366 --> 32:33.118
Is that one of them
marijuana cigarettes?

32:33.202 --> 32:35.788
We don't have enough
for everybody. Cool it.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.289
We can't, Violet.

32:37.373 --> 32:38.624
Someone
might come in.

32:38.707 --> 32:39.959
It is dangerous,
Violet.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.628
Would you two show
a little spunk?

32:42.711 --> 32:45.798
What are you,
a man or a mouse?

32:45.881 --> 32:48.300
I mean a woman
or a wouse?

32:48.384 --> 32:49.802
Let's go
to my house.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.638
My husband's away.
We'll have the place
to ourselves.

32:52.721 --> 32:56.642
We could have ourselves
an old-fashioned ladies'
pot party.

32:56.725 --> 33:00.312
You know,
that stuff don't do
that much for me.

33:00.396 --> 33:03.732
I smoked
a marijuana cigarette
at a party once.

33:03.816 --> 33:07.903
I could never
figure out what
the big deal was.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.154
Huh.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.247
Threatening Hart
with a gun?

33:18.330 --> 33:20.624
He knows
I've got one, too.

33:20.708 --> 33:24.628
I keep it right here
at all times.

33:24.712 --> 33:28.340
All I can think,
he must have peed
in his pants.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.928
Have you ever fired it?

33:33.012 --> 33:35.264
Have I ever fired it?

33:35.347 --> 33:37.433
Well, really,
just once,

33:37.516 --> 33:39.435
right after Dwayne
bought it.

33:39.518 --> 33:43.272
I was coming home
from this rodeo
with a girlfriend,

33:43.355 --> 33:45.774
and these two men
started hassling us.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.192
They wouldn't let up.

33:47.276 --> 33:50.112
I was being big
'cause I had a gun,

33:50.195 --> 33:52.281
so I reached to get it,

33:52.364 --> 33:55.784
and I shot a hole
clean through my purse.

33:59.038 --> 34:00.622
But they ran off.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.416
I bet they did.

34:04.334 --> 34:05.502
Like turkeys.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.047
Wow.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.215
This is...

34:10.299 --> 34:12.801
This is
really good pot.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.556
What did you
call it again?

34:17.639 --> 34:19.683
Maui wowee.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.018
Well, I love it.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.562
It's primo.

34:25.105 --> 34:28.233
I don't think
I could ever carry a gun.

34:28.317 --> 34:30.069
I don't understand
guys like Hart

34:30.152 --> 34:33.237
who go out and
shoot those poor,
defenseless animals

34:33.322 --> 34:36.241
like Bambi
and Thumper...

34:36.324 --> 34:38.077
and that cute little skunk.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.246
I'd like to hunt.
I'd like to hunt Hart.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.748
I'd like to chase
his lily-white tail

34:43.831 --> 34:46.168
and see how he likes it.

34:59.807 --> 35:01.809
I think she's stoned.

35:03.310 --> 35:04.228
Thumper.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.064
Am I stoned?

35:07.147 --> 35:08.649
I think
you're stoned.

35:10.818 --> 35:12.236
Oh, it's so funny.

35:12.319 --> 35:13.737
What's so funny?

35:13.821 --> 35:16.406
Oh, I have
this image of Hart

35:16.490 --> 35:18.242
running for his life,

35:18.325 --> 35:22.496
and the whole office
is out to get him
and hunt him down.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.023
There he is!

35:51.316 --> 35:52.442
Get him!

35:55.028 --> 35:57.906
Kill the bastard!

36:14.965 --> 36:16.675
Aah! Who's there?

36:19.136 --> 36:20.596
Hello, Hart.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.683
Looks like you're
in a spot of trouble.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.060
Judy?

36:27.144 --> 36:28.729
You've
got to help me.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.148
That mob's crazy.
They're trying
to kill me.

36:31.231 --> 36:33.692
Why would they
want to do that?

36:33.775 --> 36:35.944
I don't know. I'm not a bad guy.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.989
You're a sexist, egotistical,
lying, hypocritical bigot.

36:39.072 --> 36:40.741
So I have a few flaws.

36:40.824 --> 36:42.701
Is that reason
to kill me?

36:42.784 --> 36:44.244
You're foul, Hart,

36:44.328 --> 36:47.247
a wart on the nose
of humanity,

36:47.331 --> 36:49.291
and I'm going to
blast it off.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.460
Judy, Judy, Judy...

36:51.543 --> 36:53.253
Good-bye, boss-man.

36:53.337 --> 36:55.589
It's quittin' time.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.758
You can't
mean this.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.968
1...2...3...

37:00.052 --> 37:00.928
4...5...

37:01.011 --> 37:03.055
Why me?
I'm an ordinary guy

37:03.138 --> 37:04.348
trying to do his job.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.850
8...9...

37:06.934 --> 37:08.352
Holy shit.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.353
10.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.375
Hi?

38:23.176 --> 38:24.344
That's great.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.561
Well, I have just
wrecked my diet,

38:32.644 --> 38:35.397
but I love good barbecue,
don't you?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.274
Dwayne fixed these
last night.

38:37.357 --> 38:38.734
Mmm...

38:38.817 --> 38:40.569
Oh, that is
so wonderful.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.404
Oh, these
olives. Mmm.

38:42.487 --> 38:43.905
Everything tastes
so wonderful.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.657
I can't get over it.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.159
What about you,
Doralee?

38:47.242 --> 38:49.828
What's your fantasy
for doing him in?

38:49.911 --> 38:51.079
Me?

38:51.163 --> 38:55.250
Well, I think I'd like to
just come ridin' up one day

38:55.334 --> 38:58.337
and give him a taste
of his own medicine.

39:15.604 --> 39:17.022
Hey, hot stuff,

39:17.105 --> 39:19.858
grab your pad
and get your buns
in here.

39:19.941 --> 39:21.109
Yes, ma'am.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.408
Morning.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.537
Hold it.

39:32.621 --> 39:33.872
Hold it right there.

39:33.955 --> 39:34.998
Something wrong?

39:35.082 --> 39:36.041
No, no.

39:36.124 --> 39:38.210
I just wanted to
check your bod.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.712
Turn around
for a second.

39:41.797 --> 39:43.715
You got
a nice ass, Frank.

39:43.799 --> 39:46.385
You ought to get
your pants cut tighter,

39:46.468 --> 39:48.720
bring 'em up
a little in the crotch.

39:48.804 --> 39:50.222
You got a nice package.

39:50.305 --> 39:51.765
Might as well
show it off.

39:52.641 --> 39:53.642
Mrs. Rhodes.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.144
Come over here.
I want you to take a memo.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.651
To all personnel...

40:03.860 --> 40:06.196
Boy, that's great cologne
you're wearing, Frank.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.073
Oh, thank you.

40:08.156 --> 40:11.910
It's turning me on.
What's that called?

40:11.993 --> 40:12.911
Stud.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.162
Stud.

40:14.246 --> 40:16.873
Ohh.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.750
Well, it's very sexy,

40:18.834 --> 40:20.752
only I don't like
that tie you're wearing.

40:20.836 --> 40:23.255
What happened to
the ones I gave you?

40:23.338 --> 40:24.881
Well, nothing. I just‒

40:24.965 --> 40:25.924
Take it off.

40:26.007 --> 40:26.925
Excuse me?

40:27.008 --> 40:28.427
Take it off.

40:28.510 --> 40:31.388
Can't work
with those stripes
glaring out at me.

40:31.471 --> 40:34.266
How 'bout unbuttoning
that coat and your shirt?

40:34.349 --> 40:36.309
You need to loosen up.

40:37.519 --> 40:39.563
That's better.

40:39.646 --> 40:41.064
Now, where were we?

40:41.148 --> 40:42.149
The memo.

40:42.232 --> 40:45.735
Oh, by the way,
I got a surprise for you.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.779
I am a married man.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.781
Forget about
your wife, Frank.

40:49.865 --> 40:52.284
You may be hers
in the evening,

40:52.367 --> 40:54.786
but you're my boy
from nine to five.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.788
Look what
I got for you.

40:56.872 --> 40:58.123
Isn't that pretty?

40:58.206 --> 41:00.125
Yes, it's pretty.
Very pretty.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.253
But you shouldn't
be buying gifts
for me, Mrs. Rhodes.

41:03.336 --> 41:05.797
Let me put it on you.

41:05.881 --> 41:08.800
Now, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

41:08.884 --> 41:10.135
No.

41:10.218 --> 41:12.804
I love your hair.
It's so sexy.

41:12.888 --> 41:15.557
Go over on the couch.
I'll lock the door.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.267
Mrs. Rhodes‒

41:17.350 --> 41:19.269
Oh, let's be friendly, Frank.

41:19.352 --> 41:21.771
You got to be
more cooperative

41:21.855 --> 41:24.274
if you want to
keep this job.

41:24.357 --> 41:26.776
Mrs. Rhodes,
I'm not that kind of boy.

41:26.860 --> 41:28.069
Oh, get off it.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.780
One little kiss?
What's that
going to hurt?

41:30.864 --> 41:32.282
Who's gonna know?

41:32.365 --> 41:33.283
No, no.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.951
I won't.
I won't.

41:35.035 --> 41:36.286
No! No!

41:36.369 --> 41:37.287
Jeez!

41:37.370 --> 41:39.664
Frank,
you get back here.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.625
I'm warning you‒
come back here.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.293
No, I won't.

41:43.376 --> 41:46.421
<i>And he's out of the chute,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

41:46.505 --> 41:49.883
<i>Look out. That's a big bull
from the high glass tower.</i>

41:49.966 --> 41:53.470
<i>Now, Miss Doralee Rhodes
is gonna try to rope him.</i>

41:53.553 --> 41:55.639
<i>She's already got him down.</i>

41:55.722 --> 41:59.142
<i>How long will it take
to hog-tie this sexist,</i>

41:59.226 --> 42:02.020
<i>egotistical, lying,
hypocritical bigot?</i>

42:02.103 --> 42:03.980
<i>Five seconds,
ladies and gentlemen!</i>

42:04.064 --> 42:05.398
<i>Just five seconds!</i>

42:23.333 --> 42:26.253
I can just see
Hart hanging there

42:26.336 --> 42:28.255
wondering what
the hell happened.

42:28.338 --> 42:29.923
Ha, ha. Ohh.

42:30.006 --> 42:31.424
What's your
fantasy, Violet?

42:31.508 --> 42:33.927
How would you
bump off
the boss?

42:34.010 --> 42:36.930
Oh, I have to
think about it.

42:37.013 --> 42:40.267
For me, it would have to be
like a fairy tale,

42:40.350 --> 42:43.770
something gruesome
and horrible
and real gory...

42:43.853 --> 42:45.480
but kind of cute.

42:48.525 --> 42:50.485
Violet, get me
some coffee.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.153
Yes, sir.

43:11.798 --> 43:12.757
Sorry.

44:10.815 --> 44:12.067
Thank you.

44:51.690 --> 44:53.692
Your coffee,
Mr. Hart.

44:53.775 --> 44:54.776
Hmm?

44:54.859 --> 44:57.153
Oh, you can
put it down.

44:59.739 --> 45:02.158
Just the way
you like it.

45:11.960 --> 45:14.212
More coffee,
Mr. Hart?

45:14.295 --> 45:15.755
Coffee?

45:17.799 --> 45:18.883
Aah!

45:18.967 --> 45:20.009
Ooh.

45:24.848 --> 45:25.807
Aah!

45:29.894 --> 45:31.521
Ooh...ooh...

45:41.489 --> 45:43.575
I think
there was something
in that coffee.

45:43.658 --> 45:46.828
I think you're right.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.747
I think it was poison.

45:48.830 --> 45:49.748
Right again.

45:51.791 --> 45:53.209
I think you did it.

45:53.293 --> 45:55.587
♪ Ha, ha-ha, ha-ha ♪♪

45:55.670 --> 45:56.629
Uh...

45:58.673 --> 46:00.425
But why?

46:00.508 --> 46:01.509
Why?

46:01.593 --> 46:03.219
Why do you think?

46:05.597 --> 46:08.683
Because I'm a sexist,
egotistical, lying,
hypocritical bigot?

46:08.767 --> 46:10.226
Bingo.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.437
Aah!

46:34.459 --> 46:38.797
♪ Hallelujah ♪

46:38.880 --> 46:43.927
♪ Hallelujah ♪

46:44.010 --> 46:51.434

46:53.520 --> 46:55.772
Hip-hip hoorah!

46:55.855 --> 46:58.274
Hip-hip hoorah!

46:58.358 --> 46:59.609
Yay!

47:11.287 --> 47:13.706
I had such
a good time
last night.

47:13.790 --> 47:16.209
You know, we should
do that more often.

47:16.292 --> 47:19.212
How is Hart? I haven't
seen him all morning.

47:19.295 --> 47:21.673
He didn't say a word
about yesterday.

47:21.756 --> 47:22.882
He's happy.

47:22.966 --> 47:26.344
His wife left this morning
on a two-month cruise.

47:26.427 --> 47:27.554
Lucky her.

47:27.637 --> 47:31.015
She still has to
come back to him,
poor thing.

47:31.099 --> 47:32.517
Let's have
lunch today.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.018
I got to
go shopping.

47:34.102 --> 47:35.520
We're running out
of everything‒

47:35.603 --> 47:37.939
cat food, fish food,
ant spray, rat poison.

47:38.022 --> 47:40.984
Hart wants me to take
papers to his lawyer.

47:41.067 --> 47:42.443
I'll be gone
all afternoon.

47:42.527 --> 47:43.987
Aw, damn it.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.990
When you're away,
that only means
one thing.

47:48.449 --> 47:50.034
Ahh.
Ahh.
Ahh.

47:51.369 --> 47:52.370
Coffee, Violet.

47:54.205 --> 47:55.164
Now.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.293
Yes, sir.

48:02.463 --> 48:04.924
I swear, Betty,
one of these days,

48:05.008 --> 48:06.426
he'll push me too far,

48:06.509 --> 48:08.553
then I'll let him
have it.

48:08.636 --> 48:10.054
I mean,
enough is enough.

48:10.138 --> 48:12.056
We're out of
Skinny and Sweet.

48:12.140 --> 48:14.225
I got some
at lunch today.

48:14.309 --> 48:16.728
Who does he think
he is anyway‒

48:16.811 --> 48:18.730
a miserable, petty,
two-bit dictator,

48:18.813 --> 48:20.231
ordering me around

48:20.315 --> 48:22.567
like I'm
some sort of flunky?

48:22.650 --> 48:24.652
I get so mad
at myself.

48:24.736 --> 48:26.154
I've been
such a nerd.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.907
Violet, he just
does it to annoy you.

48:28.990 --> 48:30.909
Don't let him
get to you.

48:30.992 --> 48:32.577
Besides,
the day's almost over.

48:32.660 --> 48:33.620
You're right.

48:33.703 --> 48:35.622
I tell myself
the same thing,

48:35.705 --> 48:37.123
but the pressure's
building up.

48:37.206 --> 48:39.292
I can't take
much more of this.

48:39.375 --> 48:42.128
Something,
somewhere, sometime
is going to snap,

48:42.211 --> 48:44.130
and then,
God help Mr. Hart,

48:44.213 --> 48:47.175
because I won't
be responsible
for my actions.

48:49.177 --> 48:51.679
Ahh, but right now,

48:51.763 --> 48:53.765
I'm calm,
perfectly calm.

49:00.146 --> 49:01.064
No.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.525
Not for one second.

49:06.694 --> 49:07.612
Right.

49:07.695 --> 49:09.572
Hold it.
Hold it a minute.

49:09.656 --> 49:11.074
I've already
told Bob Enright,

49:11.157 --> 49:13.076
and now
I'm telling you.

49:13.159 --> 49:16.079
When you get
anything at all
from Ajax Warehouse,

49:16.162 --> 49:17.956
you bring it
directly to me.

49:18.039 --> 49:18.957
Got that?

49:19.040 --> 49:21.125
You're the boss.

49:21.209 --> 49:23.753
You might remember that
a little more often.

49:23.836 --> 49:25.254
Ha, ha, ha.

49:25.338 --> 49:26.756
See he caught you.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.758
I'm a tree.
I can bend.

49:28.841 --> 49:30.259
Hang in there, honey.

49:30.343 --> 49:31.970
It's almost 5:00.

49:32.053 --> 49:33.513
Now, you listen to me.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.014
Ajax is my deal.

49:35.098 --> 49:38.434
You get your money
when I give it to you.

49:38.518 --> 49:40.895
Don't ever call me
at this number again.

49:40.979 --> 49:41.896
Jerk.

49:44.983 --> 49:47.193
Doralee. Doralee!

49:48.528 --> 49:49.821
Uhh.

49:56.577 --> 49:59.163
Oh, my goodness.

49:59.247 --> 50:00.707
Mr. Hart.

50:00.790 --> 50:02.458
Mr. Hart!

50:02.542 --> 50:04.460
Oh, Mr. Hart.

50:04.544 --> 50:05.461
Mr. Hart.

50:05.545 --> 50:06.713
Oh, no.

50:20.393 --> 50:22.270
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

50:22.353 --> 50:23.771
Violet,
where have you been?

50:23.855 --> 50:25.273
You've missed
all the excitement.

50:25.356 --> 50:26.524
What happened?

50:26.607 --> 50:28.985
They took Hart away
in an ambulance
unconscious.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.987
He had an attack
or something.

50:31.070 --> 50:32.488
He did?
Well, where's Doralee?

50:32.572 --> 50:33.948
Well, she went
with him.

50:34.032 --> 50:35.450
I hope it's
not serious.

50:35.533 --> 50:36.451
Me, neither.

50:36.534 --> 50:37.952
Well, maybe
a little serious.

50:38.036 --> 50:41.956
Some trifle that'll
keep him out for
the next 20 years.

50:42.040 --> 50:42.957
Let's go.

50:43.041 --> 50:44.959
I'll meet you
at the elevator.

50:45.043 --> 50:45.960
Okay.

50:53.718 --> 50:55.136
Oh, my God!

50:57.722 --> 50:59.307
Oh, my God.

50:59.390 --> 51:00.600
Ahh.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.313
Oh.

51:06.939 --> 51:07.857
Violet,

51:07.940 --> 51:10.151
isn't it awful
about Mr. Hart?

51:10.234 --> 51:11.694
How did it happen,
Roz?

51:11.778 --> 51:15.323
Fell and hit his head
on the credenza.

51:15.406 --> 51:16.824
What about
the coffee?

51:16.908 --> 51:17.825
What?

51:17.909 --> 51:19.327
Where is the coffee cup?

51:19.410 --> 51:20.328
Oh, here.

51:20.411 --> 51:22.747
It was by him
on the floor.

51:22.830 --> 51:25.541
He must've been
drinking it
when he blacked out.

51:25.625 --> 51:26.542
What hospital?

51:26.626 --> 51:28.086
St. Ambrose.

51:28.169 --> 51:29.128
Oh.

51:29.212 --> 51:30.671
Oh, my God.

51:32.965 --> 51:35.176
I know you feel.

51:35.259 --> 51:37.095
Aah. Aah.

51:37.178 --> 51:38.137
Judy.

51:38.221 --> 51:40.139
Oh, Judy.
Hurry. Hurry.

51:40.223 --> 51:41.641
What's the matter?

51:41.724 --> 51:43.142
Something terrible's
happened.

51:43.226 --> 51:44.685
You won't
believe it.

51:45.770 --> 51:47.188
I don't believe it.

51:47.271 --> 51:49.690
How could you make
such a stupid mistake?

51:49.774 --> 51:51.984
I thought it was
Skinny and Sweet.

51:52.068 --> 51:53.486
Here, look.
They're identical,

51:53.569 --> 51:56.447
except for
the skull and crossbones
on the label.

51:56.531 --> 51:57.949
Someone's
going to see you.

51:58.032 --> 51:59.909
I've got to
go to the hospital.

51:59.992 --> 52:02.078
They'll have to
pump his stomach.

52:02.161 --> 52:03.830
Don't be hysterical.
Don't be hysterical.

52:03.913 --> 52:05.873
You're right.
Keep calm. Keep calm.

52:17.677 --> 52:19.595
You'd better speak
to admitting, ma'am.

52:19.679 --> 52:20.596
Yeah. Right.

52:27.353 --> 52:28.771
My boss was
brought in.

52:28.855 --> 52:30.189
Franklin Hart.

52:34.902 --> 52:36.320
There we go.

52:41.993 --> 52:43.327
What's go‒

52:43.411 --> 52:44.829
What's going on?

52:44.912 --> 52:47.456
Take it easy now.
You blacked out.

52:47.540 --> 52:49.083
How do you feel?

52:49.167 --> 52:50.585
I feel fine.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.963
I fell off a chair
and hit my head.

52:54.046 --> 52:55.298
Uh-huh.

52:55.381 --> 52:56.299
Ooh.

52:56.382 --> 52:58.259
You got quite
a bump there.

52:58.342 --> 53:01.179
I think we'll take you
upstairs for X-rays.

53:01.262 --> 53:02.180
X-rays?

53:02.263 --> 53:03.973
Mm-hmm.

53:04.056 --> 53:05.474
Wait a minute, doc.

53:05.558 --> 53:07.476
I don't want
any X-rays.

53:07.560 --> 53:08.769
I like my head.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.813
We ought to do some tests.

53:10.897 --> 53:12.315
You do tests
on yourself.

53:12.398 --> 53:14.859
I know what you guys
racket is.

53:14.942 --> 53:17.361
You're not
suckering me
into hospital bills,

53:17.445 --> 53:19.739
not for a little
bump on the head.

53:19.822 --> 53:21.866
Hey, doc.
Cardiac arrest.

53:21.949 --> 53:23.367
He stopped breathing.

53:23.451 --> 53:26.370
Open his shirt.
Plug him into
the monitor.

53:27.997 --> 53:31.125
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

53:31.209 --> 53:32.585
1, 2.

53:41.469 --> 53:43.221
Hurry.

53:44.347 --> 53:47.391
2, 3, 4, 5.

53:47.475 --> 53:51.145
1, 2, 3, 4.

53:52.813 --> 53:53.981
That bum.

53:55.066 --> 53:56.692
He was our
only witness.

53:56.776 --> 53:58.527
We had him all ready
to testify.

53:58.611 --> 53:59.904
Now this.

54:01.864 --> 54:02.782
There's Doralee.

54:02.865 --> 54:03.783
Doralee.

54:03.866 --> 54:05.284
What are you
doing here?

54:05.368 --> 54:06.744
Doralee, something
terrible has happened.

54:06.827 --> 54:07.745
What?

54:07.828 --> 54:09.747
Violet put poison
in Hart's coffee.

54:09.830 --> 54:11.207
It was an accident.

54:11.290 --> 54:12.708
You mean,
that's why‒

54:12.792 --> 54:15.169
It looks just like
Skinny and Sweet.

54:15.253 --> 54:16.212
Good grief.

54:16.295 --> 54:17.713
Where is he?

54:17.797 --> 54:20.549
The emergency room.
First door
on the right.

54:20.633 --> 54:22.718
Oh, my God.
There's a policeman.

54:22.802 --> 54:25.721
What's he doing here?

54:25.805 --> 54:27.265
I don't know.

54:27.348 --> 54:30.101
The guy on the gurney,
how is he?

54:30.184 --> 54:31.602
He's not so good.

54:31.686 --> 54:33.813
Can I speak
to the doctor?

54:33.896 --> 54:35.773
He knows
you're here.

54:35.856 --> 54:37.275
He knows I'm here.

54:37.358 --> 54:39.819
Oh, my God.
They found out already.

54:39.902 --> 54:41.279
Don't panic.
Please don't panic.

54:41.362 --> 54:43.072
How is he, doc?

54:43.155 --> 54:44.573
Ah, he's dead.

54:44.657 --> 54:45.616
Aw.

54:45.700 --> 54:47.743
Oh, my God.

54:47.827 --> 54:49.203
Can you tell
what caused it?

54:49.287 --> 54:50.955
Not without
an autopsy.

54:51.038 --> 54:53.457
You fellows can
come into my office.

54:53.541 --> 54:55.459
I'm fairly certain
it was poison.

54:55.543 --> 54:56.460
Poison?

54:56.544 --> 54:57.628
Ahh.

54:57.712 --> 55:00.589
It's okay.
It's okay.

55:00.673 --> 55:01.549
Easy now.

55:01.632 --> 55:02.550
Poison.

55:02.633 --> 55:03.551
Poison.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.052
It's all over.

55:05.136 --> 55:06.554
Did you hear‒
an autopsy?

55:06.637 --> 55:09.974
I'll save them the trouble
and give them the poison.

55:10.057 --> 55:10.975
Violet!

55:11.058 --> 55:12.893
You want someone
to see it?

55:12.977 --> 55:14.395
Who cares?
I'm finished.

55:14.478 --> 55:15.813
I'm a murderer.

55:15.896 --> 55:17.315
No, you're not.

55:17.398 --> 55:19.108
I'm a murderess.

55:19.191 --> 55:20.609
My poor kids.

55:20.693 --> 55:22.111
Violet, you're nothing
until proven guilty.

55:22.194 --> 55:25.323
They'll find
the poison when
they do the autopsy.

55:25.406 --> 55:27.325
I'll get rid
of the poison.

55:27.408 --> 55:29.327
I'll get rid
of the body.

55:29.410 --> 55:31.829
No, it's not murder.
They're are extenuating
circumstances.

55:31.912 --> 55:33.497
It was an accident.

55:33.581 --> 55:34.665
An accident?

55:34.749 --> 55:37.043
She was thinking
about doing it
last night.

55:37.126 --> 55:39.045
We all thought
about it.

55:39.128 --> 55:41.047
She didn't do it
on purpose.

55:41.130 --> 55:42.548
Oh, maybe
unconsciously I did.

55:42.631 --> 55:45.426
I'm going to the pen.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.345
Let's get
her a lawyer.

55:47.428 --> 55:49.180
I'll be locked up for life.
Where's the phone?

55:49.263 --> 55:50.514
Over there.

55:50.598 --> 55:51.974
Do you have
any change?

55:52.058 --> 55:53.976
I'm going to
lose my job.

55:54.060 --> 55:54.977
Calm down.

55:55.061 --> 55:56.479
I've killed the boss.

55:56.562 --> 55:58.981
You think they're not going to
fire me for that?

55:59.065 --> 56:01.609
Hush. Now just sit here.
We'll be right back.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.961
Oh, medic,
this the guy
for the autopsy?

56:21.045 --> 56:21.962
Yeah.

56:22.046 --> 56:24.465
The doctor would
like to see you.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.133
Right this way.

57:29.864 --> 57:32.199
They're looking for
a second opinion.

57:32.283 --> 57:33.659
I'm going to
go ahead.

57:33.742 --> 57:37.705
So, look, if you can
get it to them by Friday...

58:21.999 --> 58:22.666
Ma'am.
Ohh!

58:22.750 --> 58:25.503
Excuse me. Where's
the coffee shop?

58:25.586 --> 58:26.504
What?

58:26.587 --> 58:28.005
The coffee shop.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.507
The coffee shop?

58:29.590 --> 58:31.258
No. I'm new here.

58:31.342 --> 58:34.470
I'm new here, too.
Where do you work?

58:34.553 --> 58:35.513
Downstairs.

58:35.596 --> 58:37.348
The morgue?

58:37.431 --> 58:38.307
That's right.

58:38.390 --> 58:39.308
He's...

58:39.391 --> 58:40.809
Yes, he is.

58:40.893 --> 58:41.810
How?

58:41.894 --> 58:43.604
Coffee,
too much coffee.

58:43.687 --> 58:46.106
I'm just taking him
out for some air‒

58:46.190 --> 58:49.193
Air for me.
He's coming along
for the ride.

58:50.819 --> 58:52.279
You're a doctor.

58:52.363 --> 58:53.822
I didn't see
your badge.

58:53.906 --> 58:54.782
Sorry.

58:54.865 --> 58:56.033
I'm a doctor.

58:56.116 --> 58:57.576
Why am I talking
to you?

58:57.660 --> 58:58.619
Piss off.

59:04.416 --> 59:05.292
How's Violet?

59:13.300 --> 59:16.387
Oh, honey, I think
Violet has flipped out.

59:50.671 --> 59:52.131
Violet,
what are you doing?

59:52.214 --> 59:54.133
Come on,
get in. Get in.

59:54.216 --> 59:56.927
There's no time
for talking. Get in.

01:00:00.139 --> 01:00:03.100
Violet, slow down.

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:04.560
Why are you
driving fast?

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:07.104
They can't
do an autopsy
without a body.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:08.772
I told you
she's flipped.

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:11.442
She has just
absolutely flipped.

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:13.110
Where is the body?

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:14.570
In the trunk.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:16.071
We'll get
cement blocks

01:00:16.155 --> 01:00:18.282
and pitch him
off the pier.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.783
No one will
ever know.

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:20.784
You're crazy.

01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:22.620
They always find it.

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:24.079
Oh, crazy, am I?

01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:25.748
They never found
Jimmy Hoffa.

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:27.583
Slow down.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.543
Will you just
slow down?

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.629
Let's not panic.
Let's not panic.

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:33.130
There's a restaurant
up there.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:35.633
Why don't we pull over
and stop for a bite?

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:38.969
How can you
think of food
at a time like this?

01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:40.512
I'm not thinking
of food.

01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:42.056
I'm not hungry.

01:00:50.022 --> 01:00:51.482
Violet,
we're not criminal.

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.817
You're not a criminal.
It was an accident.

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:55.444
Well, we're
criminals now.

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.946
We've just
stolen a corpse
from a hospital.

01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.448
That sounds like
criminal to me.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:02.493
We'll just turn around
and take it back.

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:04.161
We'll get caught.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.163
You think they'll
listen to us?

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:07.665
Will you please
stop arguing?

01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:10.501
Think about
where we can get
some cement.

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:16.632
Look out!

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.759
Don't panic. Don't panic.

01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:23.597
Aah.
Aah.
Aah.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:28.936
What happened?

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:29.978
She panicked.

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:31.021
Nobody's hurt.

01:01:31.105 --> 01:01:32.898
It's just a little accident.

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:35.567
We'll be out
of here in no time.

01:01:37.528 --> 01:01:39.446
The front fender's
hitting the tire.

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.449
Oh, good Lord. Get out.
Let's look at it.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:48.288
Oh, that ain't
too bad.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:50.374
We'll pull
that fender out.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:51.875
Give me a hand.

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.460
Oh, God.

01:01:53.544 --> 01:01:55.129
Wait. That's no use.

01:01:55.212 --> 01:01:57.089
We need a crowbar
or something.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:00.134
There's a tire iron
in the trunk.

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:09.393
Judy, turn
the blinkers off.

01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:31.123
Uh, Judy, would
you come back here
for a second?

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:36.420
What?

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.922
Look.

01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:39.923
Who's that?

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:41.425
I don't know.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:42.426
Where's Hart?

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.595
I don't know.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:47.389
Oh, my God.
You mean, she‒

01:02:47.473 --> 01:02:49.391
Oh, my God!

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:56.774
Violet, honey,
would you come over here
for a second?

01:02:56.857 --> 01:02:58.734
What is the matter
with you?

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:00.235
We have got
to get the‒

01:03:00.319 --> 01:03:01.236
Who is that?

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.405
I don't know.

01:03:03.489 --> 01:03:05.949
What do you mean
you don't know?

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:07.826
What happened
to Hart's body?

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:11.121
It's not here.
You think it walked away?

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:12.080
But I‒

01:03:12.164 --> 01:03:13.582
Violet,
how could you?

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.083
How could you?

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.795
I guess I must have
made a mistake.

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:19.755
You steal
the wrong body,

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.633
and all you can say
is, "I made a mistake."

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.134
It could happen
to anyone.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:26.136
Oh, this is awful.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.679
It's so improper.

01:03:27.763 --> 01:03:29.181
It's so disrespectful.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.891
He's dead.
He doesn't mind.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:32.893
There's nothing to
get excited about.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.478
We'll just take it back.

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:35.479
What?

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.148
No harm's done.
We'll take it back.

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:39.316
That's great.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:42.820
We waltz in there and
say, "we made a mistake."

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:45.280
Maybe they'll give us
Hart's body in exchange.

01:03:45.364 --> 01:03:47.115
There's no need
to get sarcastic.

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:49.117
You took it.
You take it back.

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.077
Stop it.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.495
We're all
in this together.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:53.956
Now we have
to be very calm.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.958
We're going to
fix the fender.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:57.960
We'll go back
to the hospital.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.963
We'll figure
out a plan to
drop off the body.

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:03.715
Then we'll decide
what we're
going to do next.

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:05.759
I tried to tell
this woman‒

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.594
Will you two shut up?

01:04:33.579 --> 01:04:34.997
It's not a bad plan.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.498
It might work.

01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:39.001
If we could just
find a wheelchair.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:42.004
I saw a couple
outside the emergency
entrance before.

01:04:42.087 --> 01:04:43.922
I think
that's a good idea.

01:04:44.006 --> 01:04:46.925
I just wish we knew
what happened to Hart.

01:04:47.009 --> 01:04:49.469
We're going to
find out soon enough.

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.058
What's that?

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:57.769
It's a siren.

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.313
It's a policeman.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.106
He wants us
to pull over.

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:03.483
Do I make
a break for it?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.110
I've got my gun.

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:06.528
Are you crazy?

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:08.030
Oh, my God.

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:10.032
Don't panic.
Don't panic.

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:11.158
What does he want?

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.869
I don't know.
Pull over.

01:05:13.952 --> 01:05:16.079
Pull over.
Be ready for anything.

01:05:16.163 --> 01:05:18.582
Listen to what he says
and don't panic.

01:05:18.665 --> 01:05:20.083
But what if he wants‒

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:22.794
For Christ's sake,
pull over! Pull over!

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.435
Good evening, ladies.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.938
May I see
your license and
registration, please?

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.439
Why? I wasn't speeding.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:43.899
I didn't say
you were.

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:45.275
Your taillight
is blinking.

01:05:45.359 --> 01:05:46.276
It is?

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.112
Are your signals on?

01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:50.113
No.

01:05:50.197 --> 01:05:52.240
There's a short
in the trunk.

01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:53.742
A short in the trunk?

01:05:53.825 --> 01:05:56.703
We've got a short
in the trunk.

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:58.205
Probably just
a defective wire.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.873
You want
to take a look?

01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:01.792
Do we want
to take a look?

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.795
No, we can't, Officer.
We don't have time.

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:06.296
We're on an emergency.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:08.465
That's‒that's right.
She's a doctor.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:09.800
Oh, you're
a doctor?

01:06:09.883 --> 01:06:12.678
What do think I am,
a beautician?

01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:14.137
I didn't see
your badge.

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:15.639
What's
the trouble?

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:19.309
I'm taking this woman
to the hospital,
and she's sick.

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:21.061
Which one
of you is sick?

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.771
I am.
I am.

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.481
She is.
She is.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:27.109
They're both sick.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:32.155
What is that
you're hiding there?

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:33.156
What? This?

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.157
Yes.

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:35.659
It's rat poison.

01:06:35.742 --> 01:06:37.160
She ate it.

01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:38.245
What?

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.831
She ate
the rat poison.
That's why they're sick.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.290
You ate the rat poison?

01:06:42.374 --> 01:06:44.668
I thought it was
Skinny and Sweet.

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:47.170
It looks just like
Skinny and Sweet,

01:06:47.254 --> 01:06:50.632
except for the little
skull and crossbones
on the label.

01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:52.134
Can we go now,
Officer?

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:53.844
I'm not feeling very well.

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.345
Did you hear that?

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:56.847
She's not feeling
very well.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:58.640
I've got a dying woman,

01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:01.059
and you want to look
for a short.

01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:03.562
I'm sorry.
If we don't
make it on time,

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:05.063
I'm holding you
responsible.

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:06.064
Don't worry.

01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:07.566
I'll give you
an escort.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:08.567
An escort?

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:11.194
He's going to
give us an escort.

01:07:11.278 --> 01:07:12.863
Oh, Lord.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:13.822
Hang on‒

01:07:13.905 --> 01:07:16.408
Forget it, Mac.
We can't wait.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:33.133
How did it go?

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:35.135
I couldn't find out
about Hart.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.721
They don't know,
or they won't tell us.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.222
What are we
going to do?

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:40.307
Nothing.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.768
We're going to wait
until they come to us.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:44.728
Go to the office
in the morning

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.730
and pretend like
nothing has happened.

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.108
Well, what about
the other matter?

01:07:50.192 --> 01:07:51.651
Don't worry about it.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:55.155
It's been taken care of.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:17.928
Hey, Viv.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:21.723
We got another stiff
in the john.

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:32.274
Morning, Judy.

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:34.444
Morning, Violet.

01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:36.446
Doralee, uh,
no calls this morning.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:39.491
I don't want to be
disturbed at all.

01:08:47.666 --> 01:08:50.042
All that running
around last night
was useless.

01:08:50.127 --> 01:08:53.087
Hart left with
a little bump
on his head.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:55.590
I did put the poison
in the coffee.

01:08:55.674 --> 01:08:57.091
I know it.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:59.678
Well, he absolutely
did not drink it, Violet.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.680
How could we
be so stupid?

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:04.224
Did anybody
think to look
under the stalls.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.225
Yes. Yes.
And there's nobody there.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.645
Look, I propose we forget
the whole thing.

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:10.147
It never happened.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.648
That's okay with me.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:13.483
I'll never
mention it again.

01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:14.984
Thank God
it's Friday.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:16.987
Why don't we start
the weekend

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.488
with a drink
at Charlie's?

01:09:18.572 --> 01:09:20.657
You know,
we are so lucky.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.326
I'm glad this whole
mess is finally over.

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.120
Oh, me, too.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.299
Is this accurate?

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:38.800
They actually
said this?

01:09:38.884 --> 01:09:40.801
Clearly as I could
make out.

01:09:40.886 --> 01:09:42.804
My notes were
a little fuzzy.

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:44.723
Well, this is
very interesting.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:48.225
Stealing corpses,
eluding the police.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:50.729
May-Maybe they knew
you were hiding,

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:52.647
just‒just pulling
your leg.

01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:54.232
I don't think so.

01:09:54.316 --> 01:09:59.404
In any event, I think
you should be aware of
that coffee business.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:03.867
Yeah. I think
I can use that
to some advantage.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.368
Whoo! Look out,
Charlie's,

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:06.870
here we come.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.872
Oh, Judy.
Wait just a second.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.457
I'll be right back.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.000
I'll‒I'll tell Violet.

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:15.962
It's 5:00, Mr. Hart.
You wanted to see me?

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:16.963
I did, Doralee.

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:20.008
I'd like you to come over
to my house tonight.

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:23.970
I'm not working
tonight.
This is Friday.

01:10:24.054 --> 01:10:26.223
Who said anything
about work?

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:29.768
Oh, uh, by the way,

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:32.103
have you ever
heard of strychnine?

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:34.606
Strychnine
is a poison, I think.

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.233
Yes, it is a poison.

01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:38.193
I just talked to
the hospital.

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:40.237
They found
traces of strychnine

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.948
when they pumped out
my stomach yesterday.

01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:45.575
What? You told me
you just hit your head.

01:10:45.659 --> 01:10:49.496
I had to be sure.
I think you need
evidence like that

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.915
if you're going to
accuse somebody of murder.

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:52.999
Murder?

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:53.917
Yeah.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.419
You and Violet
and that girl Judy

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:57.921
tried to murder me
yesterday.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:00.882
Put the rat poison
in my coffee.

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:03.385
Oh, my goodness.
I don't believe this.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.387
It was all a big mistake.

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:06.888
That's very good.

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:09.891
You should be scared,
because I know
all about it.

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:12.894
All I have to do
is call the police.

01:11:12.978 --> 01:11:14.896
It really
was a mistake.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:17.899
Violet put the poison in
strictly by accident.

01:11:17.983 --> 01:11:20.360
She might get a jury
to believe that.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:21.861
Then again, she might not.

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:24.698
But the big question here
is whether or not

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:25.949
you want to take
that chance.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:28.118
What are you
driving at?

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.619
It's very simple.

01:11:29.703 --> 01:11:31.454
You come over
to my house,

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:33.290
and I'll forget
the whole thing.

01:11:33.373 --> 01:11:34.874
You are disgusting.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:36.418
Is that a no?

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.378
Too bad.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.963
Mr. Hart,
I'm begging you,

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.881
think about
what you're doing.

01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:45.427
I didn't start this.
You three girls
did all the plotting.

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:47.262
I won't let you
do this!

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.723
There's another phone
over there, Doralee.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.391
Incidentally,
that's something else

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.727
you might want
to think about.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:56.229
I'm very funny,
but I don't like it

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:58.648
when people give back
my presents.

01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:00.608
Oh, you are rotten,
Mr. Hart.

01:12:00.692 --> 01:12:02.610
Did anybody
ever tell you that?

01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:06.114
I never thought
I'd say this about
another human being,

01:12:06.197 --> 01:12:08.825
but you are evil‒
evil to the core!

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:11.328
I love it when you
get mad like that.

01:12:11.411 --> 01:12:15.457
If you touch that phone,
I'll jerk it
clean out of the wall.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.334
Ooh...

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:19.294
I mean it!

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:22.005
You think this
is all a joke.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.174
You're going to
listen to me

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:26.009
whether you like it
or not!

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.928
Will you shut up now
and let me explain
what happened?

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:32.140
Let me loose
or I'm calling for help.

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:35.268
No, I don't want you
to call for help.

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:38.271
You won't listen,
but you'll shut up
and stay there!

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:40.857
I got to figure out
what to do.

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:44.694
Roz.

01:12:44.778 --> 01:12:46.196
Is Mr. Hart in?

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:50.200
Yeah‒well, yeah,
but he's tied up
at the moment.

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:51.201
Oh. Well...

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.870
I guess it can wait
until Monday.

01:12:53.953 --> 01:12:55.372
Have a nice weekend.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:56.831
Yeah, you, too, Roz.

01:12:56.915 --> 01:12:57.874
Oh, Judy.

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:00.335
Can you come here
a second?

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:01.836
You ready, Doralee?

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.839
No! Something awful
has happened.
Where's Violet?

01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:07.842
She's in
the storage room.
What's the matter?

01:13:07.926 --> 01:13:10.345
Hart knows everything
about last night.

01:13:10.428 --> 01:13:11.429
What?

01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:14.682
He really thinks
we were trying to kill him.

01:13:14.766 --> 01:13:17.185
He was going to
have us arrested.

01:13:17.268 --> 01:13:18.686
Oh, dear God.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.688
Get in there
and watch him.

01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:23.191
Lock that door,
and don't let
anybody in.

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:24.526
I'm getting Violet.

01:13:24.609 --> 01:13:26.736
Oh, dear God.

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:29.656
Oh, dear God.

01:13:34.828 --> 01:13:37.247
Mr. Hart, I'm so sorry.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.417
What?

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.420
Oh, I can't understand
what you're saying.

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:49.259
Thank God one of you
has come to your senses.

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:50.677
Now get me loose.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.096
Doralee didn't mean
any harm, Mr. Hart.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:54.597
Just get me untied, okay?

01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:56.933
I can't do that
until they come back.

01:13:57.016 --> 01:13:59.394
You think
I'm going to run away?

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:01.896
I won't do anything.
I give you
my word of honor.

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.276
Just get me untied.
There's a little pain
involved here.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:07.777
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:10.780
Maybe I'll just
loosen it a little bit.

01:14:10.864 --> 01:14:12.115
Good. Loosen it.

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:15.076
You've got to understand
what happened last night.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.079
It was just a series
of misunderstandings.

01:14:18.163 --> 01:14:20.582
Violet didn't mean
to kill you.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:24.085
She just accidentally
put rat poison
in your coffee.

01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:26.087
Get out of my way!

01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:27.088
Mr. Hart.

01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:29.424
Mr. Hart,
you gave me your word!

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:30.967
I lied.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:32.469
God damn it.

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.429
You're not leaving
this office.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:35.972
Watch me.

01:14:36.055 --> 01:14:38.475
I was just pretending
a while ago,

01:14:38.558 --> 01:14:40.977
but this thing
is getting out of hand.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.605
Nobody makes a fool
out of me
in my own office.

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:45.148
I'm calling the police.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:47.984
Hold it right there.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.488
You're as crazy
as the other two.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:54.699
Close that door
or I'll shoot.

01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:58.620
Aah!

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.331
Hold it! Don't shoot!
I give up!

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.333
Don't shoot it!

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.168
Judy, put it‒

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:06.836
Judy, what are you doing?

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.964
Oh, my God.

01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:11.591
Christ.

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:14.761
He‒He was going
to call the police.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.527
I just feel terrible
doing this to him.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:34.531
We'll get him to his place
and try to reason with him.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:37.283
His wife's on vacation,
and that house
is so far off the road,

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:39.953
if he yells,
ain't nobody gonna hear him.

01:15:48.628 --> 01:15:50.380
So what do we do now?

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:51.839
You'll pay for this.

01:15:51.923 --> 01:15:54.467
I swear you'll pay for this.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:55.885
If you'd only listen.

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:57.178
You listen to me.

01:15:57.262 --> 01:16:00.431
I'll see you all in prison
before I'm through.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:01.432
Kidnapping.

01:16:01.516 --> 01:16:02.725
Attempted murder.

01:16:02.809 --> 01:16:04.185
Roped, beaten,

01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:05.728
rat poison.

01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:08.648
I won't rest
until you all get
20 years in prison!

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:10.191
You understand that?

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:11.276
20 years!

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:13.903
God!

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.823
We can't just
keep him here forever.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:18.324
Oh, you heard him.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:19.826
He don't believe us.

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.327
He wants
to prosecute.

01:16:21.411 --> 01:16:22.954
Why wouldn't he?
He's got you
for poisoning him

01:16:23.037 --> 01:16:24.247
and me for roping him

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:28.501
and you for acting like
he was first prize
in a turkey shoot.

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:32.505
How are we going
to keep him from talking?

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.425
I say we hire
a couple of wranglers

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.677
to go upstairs
and beat the shit
out of him.

01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:44.183
If we could only
find something on him,
maybe we could trade off.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.935
Blackmail.
All that sounds good.

01:16:46.019 --> 01:16:48.021
What could we
get on him?

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:51.774
A sex scandal.

01:16:51.858 --> 01:16:55.111
Take a picture of him
in bed with a prostitute.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:57.780
Oh, who would care?

01:16:57.864 --> 01:17:00.241
Hart would just
buy up the copies

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:03.244
and send them out
as Christmas cards.

01:17:05.872 --> 01:17:07.206
Oh, Lord.

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.677
We've gone over
everything.

01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:22.680
Well, we might
as well face it.

01:17:22.764 --> 01:17:25.224
He's got us.
We're licked.

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:28.144
Wait a minute.
What's this doing here?

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:30.730
What?

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:35.985
Maybe we do have something
to bargain with after all.

01:17:36.069 --> 01:17:37.320
What is it?

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:41.032
An account book
for Ajax Warehouse.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:52.919
There's
something suspicious
going on here.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:55.922
This is out
in the middle of nowhere.

01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:58.508
What do you see?

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.009
Nothing.
It's too dark.

01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:03.054
Why don't you
climb up to that window?

01:18:18.403 --> 01:18:20.321
I think we got him.

01:18:20.405 --> 01:18:22.824
Ha, ha, ha!
I think we got him!

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:23.991
Aah!

01:18:25.535 --> 01:18:26.953
Whoo! Yes, indeed,

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:30.123
it looks like Frank
has been a very
naughty boy.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.291
An empty warehouse?

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:35.044
What's wrong with that?

01:18:35.128 --> 01:18:37.547
That's what
Billie Sol Estes
said,

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.049
and they gave him
15 years
for embezzlement.

01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:42.552
That warehouse
is supposed to be
filled with inventory

01:18:42.635 --> 01:18:44.137
from Consolidated.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.973
But you sold it
and pocketed the money.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:48.725
You can't prove that.

01:18:48.808 --> 01:18:51.185
I'm going to order
the invoices

01:18:51.269 --> 01:18:53.187
from head office,
on Monday.

01:18:53.271 --> 01:18:57.567
I think you'll...
see the light
when they arrive.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.527
You start tangling with me,

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:02.530
you'd better be prepared
to play very rough,

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:05.533
because I'm not
going to be stopped

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.493
by three
dumb-witted broads.

01:19:07.577 --> 01:19:08.578
I'm not‒

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:12.915
I'm going to get loose.

01:19:12.999 --> 01:19:14.917
I'm going to break loose

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:18.421
if I have to kill somebody
to do it.

01:19:18.504 --> 01:19:21.424
To keep him tied up
three of four days,

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:24.177
we need a better
system of confinement.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.596
Yes. Something that
limits his movement,

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:30.349
but it should
wear well
and be comfortable.

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:55.917
We figure you'll
sign our statement
by the end of the week,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.419
and then we'll
be able to let you go.

01:19:58.503 --> 01:20:00.922
I got all the razors
and the scissors

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.924
and all the glass,
just in case.

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:05.426
I brought you
some books and magazines.

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:06.928
This one is really good.

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:09.931
This'll keep you
up-to-date on all
the soap operas.

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:12.433
Once you watch them,
you really get hooked.

01:20:12.517 --> 01:20:13.935
And I got you cigars.

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:17.438
Judy will stay at night,
Doralee will bring
your lunch,

01:20:17.522 --> 01:20:20.441
and in the daytime,
we have this little
security system.

01:20:20.525 --> 01:20:22.777
I paid for it
on your
Master Charge.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.487
You're out of your mind.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.490
You think you can
keep me here for a week?

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:29.158
For Christ's sake,
I'm the boss.

01:20:29.242 --> 01:20:31.828
Don't you think I might
be missed at the office?

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:35.164
Franklin Hart's office.

01:20:35.248 --> 01:20:37.458
No, he's, uh, not here
right now.

01:20:37.542 --> 01:20:38.835
Can I help you?

01:20:38.918 --> 01:20:41.671
Yes, Mr. Strell.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:44.131
Judy Bernly. Please hold.

01:20:45.216 --> 01:20:47.009
Judy Bernly. Please hold.

01:20:47.093 --> 01:20:48.511
Hello. Judy Bernly.

01:20:49.595 --> 01:20:50.513
Hey, Violet.

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.515
What can I
do you for, Bob?

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:54.517
Would you look at this?

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.143
I can't make it out.

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:59.647
But, Doralee,
I want to talk
to him today.

01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:01.649
Well, I will tell him.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.678
He's not here.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.639
He's not? Well,
that's kind of funny.

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:35.474
I thought he was.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.938
Well, he hasn't
gone to lunch.

01:21:41.022 --> 01:21:42.440
His coat's still here.

01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:45.401
Look at that.
I've told him
a hundred times

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.403
this can be
very dangerous.

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:49.906
I'm sure
he'll be back, Roz.

01:21:49.989 --> 01:21:51.407
You want to wait?

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:54.911
No, thank you,
but please tell him
it's very important

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.913
I talk to him
sometime today.

01:21:56.996 --> 01:21:59.415
I will "soitenly"
tell him, Roz.

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:01.918
She is going
to be tough.

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:03.419
Hmm.
What about the others?

01:22:03.502 --> 01:22:04.921
Piece of cake.

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:07.924
There were a few
questions we need
answered from‒

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:09.425
Yeah, I saw those.

01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:11.427
And some letters
you should see,

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.930
but other than that
I think we're fine.

01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:16.432
Did you want
a cup of coffee?

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:19.352
Oh. Sorry.

01:22:43.584 --> 01:22:45.378
Hello, Mr. Hart.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:46.587
It's lunch.

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:50.716
Where's the tray stand
that was here yesterday?

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.846
Oh, uh, it's behind
that pile of stuff
over there.

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:01.894
Aah!

01:23:03.062 --> 01:23:05.815
Doralee!

01:23:05.898 --> 01:23:07.733
Damn it!

01:23:07.817 --> 01:23:09.902
I'll get your ass!

01:23:09.986 --> 01:23:11.570
Promise.

01:23:16.409 --> 01:23:17.785
I don't understand.

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.787
Did you give him
my message?

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:23.290
Yes, but he left the office
just this second.

01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:26.419
But I'll bet you can
still catch him.

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:27.336
Judy!

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.338
Do you see Mr. Hart?

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:30.673
Uh, yes.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:33.551
Well, stop him.

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:34.844
Mr. Hart!

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:37.513
Mr. Hart!

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:38.931
Mr. Hart!

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:40.016
Mr.‒

01:23:40.099 --> 01:23:43.019
Oh, you just
missed him.

01:23:43.102 --> 01:23:44.603
Mmm.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.278
We can't keep that up
all week.

01:23:52.361 --> 01:23:55.281
You're right.
She's going
to be a problem.

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:59.285
I've got
some bad news.

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:03.956
Here's the telex
from head office
in New York.

01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:06.542
They've started
the computer changeover.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.503
They won't be able
to send us

01:24:09.587 --> 01:24:12.006
the inventory invoices
for Ajax Warehouse

01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:14.717
for another
four to six weeks.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.177
Four to six weeks?

01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:19.388
We have to keep Hart
tied up all that time?

01:24:19.472 --> 01:24:21.891
Do we have a choice?

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:24.852
I think we can
pull it off.

01:24:24.935 --> 01:24:27.855
I never realized
how unpopular
Hart is.

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:29.565
Nobody wants
to see him
face-to-face.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:32.151
Except Roz.

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:37.073
What if we sent Roz
on vacation?

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:38.574
That's only two weeks.

01:24:38.657 --> 01:24:41.077
We've got to
keep her away longer.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:43.954
Have you ever
heard of the Aspen
Language Center?

01:24:44.038 --> 01:24:45.456
It's one
of these places

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:48.459
that gives you very
concentrated lessons
in foreign languages.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:50.461
Why don't we
send her there?

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:52.463
You know,
that's not half bad.

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:57.009
We could get Hart
to write her
that it's top-secret.

01:24:57.093 --> 01:24:58.761
Consolidated is opening
overseas centers,

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:00.346
and they need executives
who can...

01:25:00.429 --> 01:25:02.306
I don't know‒
Speak French.

01:25:02.389 --> 01:25:03.933
Do you think
she'd go?

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:06.519
Are you kidding?
If Hart asked her to?

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.945
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:25:16.028 --> 01:25:17.446
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:25:17.530 --> 01:25:19.657
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:21.617
Hmm.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.577
It was just so easy.

01:25:23.661 --> 01:25:27.081
I just typed up this memo
and signed Hart's name.

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:29.583
She doesn't get back
until the 15th,

01:25:29.667 --> 01:25:32.586
and Missy doesn't return
until the 24th.

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.089
Don't you feel sorry
for Missy?

01:25:35.172 --> 01:25:38.092
I'll have Hart
send her some flowers
in Tahiti.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.593
How's everything
upstairs?

01:25:39.677 --> 01:25:40.594
Very subdued.

01:25:40.678 --> 01:25:42.596
I think he's
plotting something.

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.515
It's going to be
a race

01:25:44.598 --> 01:25:46.517
to see if he can
get free

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.020
before we
get the invoices,
sometime around here.

01:25:50.104 --> 01:25:52.523
While I'm at it,
I'll just have Hart

01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:55.025
let everybody
keep flowers
on their desks.

01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:57.194
Change some things
around that office.

01:25:57.278 --> 01:26:00.281
Some of those rules of his
are so depressing.

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:25.848
It's looking good.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:29.185
But why don't we
make some changes
that really count?

01:26:29.268 --> 01:26:30.269
Yeah.

01:26:59.215 --> 01:27:02.176
<i>Like sands
through the hourglass,</i>

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:05.137
<i>so are the
days of our lives.</i>

01:27:40.506 --> 01:27:41.924
I'm happy to see

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:44.343
you still have
a hearty appetite.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.345
And I'll see you
tomorrow.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.847
If you keep being
a good boy,

01:27:48.931 --> 01:27:51.976
you'll be out of here
the end of the week.

01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:54.973
Aah!

01:29:57.810 --> 01:29:58.811
Dick.

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:00.687
Can I come in?

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:05.901
Thanks.

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:07.403
It's cold out there.

01:30:07.486 --> 01:30:09.405
Dick, what are you
doing here?

01:30:09.488 --> 01:30:11.907
You're supposed to be
in Mexico.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.409
I was.
I came back.

01:30:13.492 --> 01:30:16.078
Dick,
you can't stay here.

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.163
You're here alone,
aren't you?

01:30:18.247 --> 01:30:21.917
W-Well, yes. I'm...

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.211
house-sitting
for a friend.

01:30:24.294 --> 01:30:28.215
Yeah. I've been
casing the house
the last few days to make sure.

01:30:29.425 --> 01:30:31.343
You could spare
a cup of coffee

01:30:31.427 --> 01:30:33.512
for your freezing
old husband,
couldn't you?

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:36.181
Ex-husband.

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.434
Well, all right.
You sit down,

01:30:38.517 --> 01:30:41.478
but then you're going
to have to go.

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:55.409
It was no good
from the start.

01:30:55.492 --> 01:30:56.410
Nothing worked.

01:30:56.493 --> 01:30:59.371
She left
after the first week.

01:31:02.082 --> 01:31:04.418
Maybe you could
call me tomorrow
at work

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:06.044
and we could
have lunch,

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:07.463
talk some more.

01:31:07.546 --> 01:31:09.465
I've wanted to see you.

01:31:09.548 --> 01:31:11.967
I followed you
from the office.

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:15.554
I thought maybe
you were living
with someone.

01:31:15.637 --> 01:31:17.431
No.

01:31:31.153 --> 01:31:32.488
What was that?

01:31:32.571 --> 01:31:33.989
Oh, it's nothing.

01:31:34.072 --> 01:31:35.991
Probably the cat.
I'd better check.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:38.660
I'll go with you.
It's all right.
I'll be right back.

01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:41.330
Judy, you look
beautiful as ever.

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:43.415
Thanks.

01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:04.520
Holy shit!

01:32:04.603 --> 01:32:05.521
Oh!

01:32:05.604 --> 01:32:08.190
Oh, my God.

01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:20.035
Let go of me!

01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:22.079
Get away from me!

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:24.039
Hey!

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:26.041
Oh! Hey!
Stay away!

01:32:26.124 --> 01:32:27.918
Stay away!
I'll kill you!

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:34.800
I'll kill you!

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.016
Let go!

01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.393
Help!

01:32:44.476 --> 01:32:45.477
Help!

01:32:45.561 --> 01:32:47.312
Let go!

01:32:47.396 --> 01:32:48.855
Judy?

01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:50.857
Dick.

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:57.072
Let me down!
When I get
my hands on you‒

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:00.701
Judy.

01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:02.160
You shut up!

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:09.751
What's going on?

01:33:09.835 --> 01:33:10.919
Nothing.

01:33:11.003 --> 01:33:12.087
Who's in that room?

01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:13.589
Nobody.
Let's go downstairs.

01:33:13.672 --> 01:33:16.592
Judy, there's somebody
in that room. Let me see.

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:17.593
Good God.

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:19.428
Oh.

01:33:22.347 --> 01:33:23.390
Who is that?

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:24.474
A friend.

01:33:24.558 --> 01:33:25.601
Obviously.

01:33:25.684 --> 01:33:28.270
So, that's what
you're into now. Bondage.

01:33:28.353 --> 01:33:29.271
What's that?

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:31.440
Bondage. S and M.
Sex games.

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:34.735
That's right.
I'm into everything.
Now get out of here.

01:33:34.818 --> 01:33:35.944
I can't believe it.

01:33:36.028 --> 01:33:37.279
Who is that guy?

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:38.447
He's my boss.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:41.450
An affair with your boss.
Isn't that typical!

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:43.785
Just like you had one
with your secretary.

01:33:43.869 --> 01:33:46.955
But, Judy, this isn't you.
You can't be serious.

01:33:47.039 --> 01:33:49.958
Don't tell me
what I can or can't do.

01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:51.460
Those days are over!

01:33:51.543 --> 01:33:55.464
And if I want
to have an affair
or play sex games

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:58.175
or do M&Ms,
you can't stop me!

01:33:58.258 --> 01:33:59.301
M&Ms?

01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:01.595
Matter of fact,
I smoke pot.

01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:04.097
I see what
it's done to you!

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:05.057
Well, I've changed.

01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:07.476
I'll say. And not
for the better!

01:34:07.559 --> 01:34:11.438
And I came here
tonight to ask you
to come back... Ha!

01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:12.814
Fat chance.

01:34:12.898 --> 01:34:16.610
Your leaving was
the best thing that
ever happened to me.

01:34:16.693 --> 01:34:19.071
If that's
the way you feel,

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:20.572
there's
nothing more to say.

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:21.990
Oh, yes, there is.

01:34:22.074 --> 01:34:26.328
Hit the road, buster.
This is where you get off.

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:37.923
What are we going
to do about Roz?
She gets back on Friday.

01:34:38.006 --> 01:34:39.925
Well, if she causes
any more trouble,

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:43.428
we'll send her back
to language school
to learn German.

01:34:43.512 --> 01:34:44.346
Bet she would.

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:45.597
Talking about Roz?

01:34:45.681 --> 01:34:47.891
Forget her. I just
talked to New York.

01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:50.268
The invoices will
be here Friday morning.

01:34:50.352 --> 01:34:53.313
Perfect, three more days.
Ooh, good.

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:17.295
Uh, driver, would you
bring the bags inside,
please?

01:35:40.569 --> 01:35:41.862
Missy.

01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:43.321
Frank.

01:35:43.405 --> 01:35:46.283
What on earth
are you up to?

01:36:03.508 --> 01:36:04.426
Operator?

01:36:04.509 --> 01:36:06.428
Uh, good morning.

01:36:06.511 --> 01:36:09.848
Uh, would you find
a number for me, please?

01:36:12.851 --> 01:36:13.935
Hello?

01:36:14.019 --> 01:36:15.645
<i>Doralee,
this is Missy Hart.</i>

01:36:15.729 --> 01:36:16.938
Missy.

01:36:17.022 --> 01:36:20.442
Frank told me
never to call anybody
at the office,

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:22.778
so I'm calling
you at home.

01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:24.613
I wanted to thank you.

01:36:24.696 --> 01:36:25.614
Thank me?

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:28.617
I just realized
it must have been you

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:32.287
who sent me
those beautiful flowers
during my trip.

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:34.289
And you signed
Frank's name.

01:36:34.372 --> 01:36:36.458
Well, it was his idea.

01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:39.419
Oh, no, no, no.
It wasn't. I asked him.

01:36:39.503 --> 01:36:41.797
That's why
I came back early...

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.591
Missy, did you just say
you've come back?

01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:46.134
Yeah, three days ago.

01:36:46.218 --> 01:36:49.638
Frank sent me to a hotel
for another week.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:53.642
He's trying out
some kind of new exercise
program at the house.

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:55.143
Oh, my goodness.

01:36:55.227 --> 01:36:58.146
You should see what
he's done to our bedroom.

01:37:00.232 --> 01:37:02.192
Hello? Hello?

01:37:08.532 --> 01:37:10.450
Hello.

01:37:10.534 --> 01:37:12.452
What?

01:37:12.536 --> 01:37:14.454
I don't believe it.

01:37:14.538 --> 01:37:18.792
If she's back, then Hart
must've been free
for the last three days.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:21.044
Listen, call Judy
right away.

01:37:21.127 --> 01:37:25.173
If Hart's been doing
what I think he's been doing,
we've been had.

01:37:25.257 --> 01:37:28.927
That's silly. I just
brought him breakfast.
He's tied up.

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:30.387
Or he's just pretending.

01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:32.180
Look, you keep
ahold of my gun.

01:37:32.264 --> 01:37:35.392
I'm coming over.
Sit tight till I get there.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.376
Judy?

01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:05.964
Judy.

01:38:06.047 --> 01:38:07.966
He found your gun.

01:38:19.185 --> 01:38:20.437
Wait a minute.

01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:22.772
What happened
to the time clock?

01:38:22.856 --> 01:38:24.274
You retired it.

01:38:24.357 --> 01:38:26.943
What does
that mean?

01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:28.445
Well, while
you were away,

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:30.947
we managed
to make a few changes.

01:38:31.031 --> 01:38:33.408
Changes? What changes?

01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:45.337
Holy shit.

01:38:54.763 --> 01:38:58.099
What the hell
is going on?
Who authorized this?

01:38:58.183 --> 01:39:01.102
You did, Mr. Hart.
It's your signature.

01:39:01.186 --> 01:39:04.773
What are all these
people doing here?
It's not even 9:00.

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:06.274
It's another
of your programs.

01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:07.609
It's called
flexible hours.

01:39:07.692 --> 01:39:09.611
People set
their own time.

01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:11.112
Some work
8:00 to 4:00

01:39:11.196 --> 01:39:13.615
or 10:00 to 6:00
or 9:00 to 5:00.

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:16.618
Well, I'll put
a stop to that.
Let's go, girls.

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:17.953
Let's go.

01:39:18.036 --> 01:39:19.955
Sir, it's working
very nicely.

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:22.457
Less absenteeism.
People really like it.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:25.418
Oh, do they?
Well, I hate it,
and what I say goes.

01:39:25.502 --> 01:39:28.630
Just keep going
to my office.

01:39:31.549 --> 01:39:33.468
Good morning, Violet.
Here it is.

01:39:33.551 --> 01:39:34.970
Oh, thanks, Eric.

01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:40.809
Here are the invoices
we've been waiting for.
They're worthless now.

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:43.311
He's managed to put
all that missing equipment

01:39:43.395 --> 01:39:44.980
back into the warehouse.

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:49.567
Cost me a pretty penny
to set it straight.

01:39:49.651 --> 01:39:52.237
Well, you've won.
You've trumped our ace.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.780
So now what?

01:39:53.863 --> 01:39:55.240
Oh, I'm sorry, Violet.

01:39:55.323 --> 01:39:57.242
Why don't you
sit down there?

01:39:57.325 --> 01:40:00.870
I'm just getting ready
to send you three
bitches to jail.

01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:11.089
Hello.

01:40:11.172 --> 01:40:12.424
What?

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:14.259
Who's here?

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:17.429
Jeez,
I'll be right out.

01:40:17.512 --> 01:40:19.431
And you better
tell Hart.

01:40:25.228 --> 01:40:26.771
What?

01:40:26.855 --> 01:40:29.107
When?

01:40:29.190 --> 01:40:30.942
Holy shit.

01:40:31.026 --> 01:40:32.444
No, no. No problem.

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:33.945
Okay, right. Thanks.

01:40:34.029 --> 01:40:34.946
What is it?

01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:36.364
Tinsworthy's here.

01:40:36.448 --> 01:40:37.699
Who's that?

01:40:37.782 --> 01:40:40.785
Russell Tinsworthy,
the goddamn
chairman of the board.

01:40:40.869 --> 01:40:43.288
He's here to meet
with me.

01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:46.082
All right, just...

01:40:48.126 --> 01:40:50.962
Violet, you've
got to stand by me.

01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:00.096
Holy shit,
there he is.

01:41:06.644 --> 01:41:10.065
Here's the man himself,
Mr. Tinsworthy.

01:41:10.148 --> 01:41:11.399
Franklin Hart.

01:41:11.483 --> 01:41:15.028
Frank Hart.
My boy, I would like
to shake your hand.

01:41:16.488 --> 01:41:18.406
And here is a, uh,

01:41:18.490 --> 01:41:21.076
small token
of my esteem.

01:41:21.159 --> 01:41:23.745
Thank you, sir.
It's an honor
meeting you.

01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:26.539
You know, I don't
get up here very often.

01:41:26.623 --> 01:41:29.417
But I keep tabs
on the situation
through Perkins.

01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:31.419
And when I find
a division

01:41:31.503 --> 01:41:33.922
that shows a 20% rise
in productivity

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:35.924
over a period
of six weeks,

01:41:36.007 --> 01:41:38.593
I want to meet the man
who's responsible.

01:41:38.676 --> 01:41:41.930
Huh, well, I...
We all appreciate that.

01:41:42.013 --> 01:41:45.558
You've managed to create
a very, very splendid
environment here.

01:41:45.642 --> 01:41:47.936
Very livable,
very personal.

01:41:48.019 --> 01:41:50.939
Well, I find it very...
I don't know.

01:41:51.022 --> 01:41:54.275
The people seem
to like it.

01:41:54.359 --> 01:41:57.904
Keep the crew happy
and you can't go wrong,
eh, Frank?

01:41:57.987 --> 01:41:59.447
That's the idea, sir.

01:42:00.865 --> 01:42:02.283
Mr. Tinsworthy's
interested in

01:42:02.367 --> 01:42:04.911
some of those other
new programs of yours.

01:42:04.994 --> 01:42:05.912
Uh-huh.

01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:08.039
Like the job-sharing program.

01:42:08.123 --> 01:42:10.291
Job-sharing.

01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:12.377
A bold concept.

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.045
How's it working out?

01:42:14.129 --> 01:42:16.506
Well, I think
very well, sir.

01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:19.008
Um... well, Violet.

01:42:19.092 --> 01:42:22.595
Sorry, Mr. Tinsworthy.
I'd like you to meet
Violet Newstead.

01:42:22.679 --> 01:42:24.764
She's my senior supervisor.

01:42:24.848 --> 01:42:26.724
I'm very happy
to meet you.

01:42:26.808 --> 01:42:28.101
How do you do?

01:42:28.184 --> 01:42:30.436
I've heard a lot of
wonderful things
about you.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.437
Thank you.

01:42:31.521 --> 01:42:33.106
Violet is my right arm
around here.

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:38.444
In fact, Violet,
explain to Mr. Tinsworthy
the job-sharing situation.

01:42:38.528 --> 01:42:40.947
It's been most effective,
Mr. Tinsworthy.

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:43.992
Maria Delgado
is a perfect example.

01:42:44.075 --> 01:42:45.368
She shares her job
with another worker

01:42:45.451 --> 01:42:47.245
who takes over
in the afternoon.

01:42:47.328 --> 01:42:49.455
She does?
I mean, she does.

01:42:49.539 --> 01:42:50.915
Both women are happy,

01:42:50.999 --> 01:42:52.917
and we couldn't
be more pleased

01:42:53.001 --> 01:42:54.419
with their
performance.

01:42:54.502 --> 01:42:56.171
So you
pulled it off?

01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:58.256
Well, I like
to think we did.

01:42:58.339 --> 01:43:00.758
Good. Like
the day care center.

01:43:00.842 --> 01:43:01.759
Day care center?

01:43:01.843 --> 01:43:03.761
That reminds me,
during the war,

01:43:03.845 --> 01:43:05.763
I set up day care centers

01:43:05.847 --> 01:43:07.098
in all
the defense plants.

01:43:07.182 --> 01:43:08.725
Glad you
brought it back.

01:43:08.808 --> 01:43:10.226
That's the idea.
It...

01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:12.520
The day care center...

01:43:12.604 --> 01:43:15.064
Would you like to see it?
It's just down the hall.

01:43:15.148 --> 01:43:18.902
Thank you. I can see
why Frank reposes
such trust in you.

01:43:18.985 --> 01:43:19.903
Ha, ha. Exactly.

01:43:19.986 --> 01:43:20.904
Thank you.

01:43:20.987 --> 01:43:22.280
Violet...

01:43:23.698 --> 01:43:26.576
Our day care center
has been open two weeks.

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:28.077
It's been wonderfully
successful.

01:43:28.161 --> 01:43:29.412
Really?

01:43:29.495 --> 01:43:31.414
Yes, our working
parents love it.

01:43:31.497 --> 01:43:34.876
Oh, Mr. Hart. It's so
good to see you again.

01:43:34.959 --> 01:43:36.085
Who are you?

01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:37.629
Don't you recognize me?

01:43:37.712 --> 01:43:39.714
Margaret Foster.

01:43:39.797 --> 01:43:41.007
The old lush?

01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:42.675
Yes! That was me.

01:43:42.759 --> 01:43:44.636
But thanks
to the company's

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:49.098
alcoholics rehabilitation
program you started,
those days are over.

01:43:49.182 --> 01:43:53.978
I'll never forget
those wonderful letters
of encouragement you sent.

01:43:55.355 --> 01:43:57.482
God bless you,
Mr. Hart.

01:43:57.565 --> 01:43:58.942
Good to see you.

01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:00.443
Doesn't she look great?

01:44:00.526 --> 01:44:01.486
Hold this.

01:44:03.238 --> 01:44:05.782
When we transformed it,
the cost was minimal.

01:44:05.865 --> 01:44:08.910
It's cut down on absenteeism,
and we loved doing it.

01:44:08.993 --> 01:44:11.621
Well, Frank, I got
to give you credit.

01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:13.915
You really
pulled it off.

01:44:13.998 --> 01:44:16.918
That equal pay thing, though,
that's, uh, got to go.

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:17.919
Oh, yes.

01:44:18.002 --> 01:44:19.128
It's a good incentive,

01:44:19.212 --> 01:44:22.465
but we don't need to keep on
priming the pump.

01:44:22.548 --> 01:44:25.468
I've been talking
to Hinkle over here.

01:44:25.551 --> 01:44:26.928
Here, take her.

01:44:28.554 --> 01:44:31.516
And, uh, you're my kind
of guy, Frank.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:34.477
Creative, incisive,
get the job done.

01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:35.561
Right, sir.

01:44:35.645 --> 01:44:38.147
Now, I want you
to work with me.

01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:39.315
Excuse me?

01:44:39.399 --> 01:44:41.651
I need a man
like you, Frank.

01:44:41.734 --> 01:44:44.612
A Brazilian operation
is just about to take off.

01:44:44.696 --> 01:44:45.697
Brazil, sir?

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.782
You're going to
love it down there.

01:44:47.865 --> 01:44:49.450
You'll get
a handsome bonus,

01:44:49.534 --> 01:44:52.370
and you'll be
doing me a big favor.

01:44:52.453 --> 01:44:55.123
Yes, but, how can
I move to Brazil?

01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:57.292
Take a leave of absence.
Right, Hinkle?

01:44:57.375 --> 01:44:58.793
Anything you say, R.T.

01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:01.462
We'll go upstairs
and work this thing out.

01:45:01.546 --> 01:45:03.464
My team needs you
right away.

01:45:03.548 --> 01:45:05.800
Mr. Tinsworthy,
I appreciate this.

01:45:05.883 --> 01:45:06.801
Teamwork, teamwork.

01:45:06.884 --> 01:45:08.803
That's what
it's all about, huh?

01:45:08.886 --> 01:45:11.306
Go where you're
most needed
when you're most needed.

01:45:11.389 --> 01:45:12.807
Mr. Tinsworthy,
the jungle...

01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:15.810
Hell, man! I'm offering you
the chance of a lifetime.

01:45:15.893 --> 01:45:19.147
Two or three years there,
you'll never want
to come back.

01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:20.606
Two or three years?

01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:22.817
Yeah, you'll love it
down there.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.152
Healthy climate.

01:45:24.235 --> 01:45:25.236
Mr. Tinsworthy.

01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:27.238
Hart!

01:45:27.322 --> 01:45:29.490
Let me tell you
one thing.

01:45:29.574 --> 01:45:33.161
I ain't the kind of boy
takes no for an answer.
Yes, sir.

01:45:34.412 --> 01:45:36.622
Brazil?

01:45:39.876 --> 01:45:41.669
Did you see the look
on his face?

01:45:41.753 --> 01:45:44.213
I almost felt
sorry for him.

01:45:44.297 --> 01:45:46.090
We actually
pulled it off.

01:45:46.174 --> 01:45:47.592
And we didn't panic.

01:45:48.676 --> 01:45:50.595
And Tinsworthy
loved what we did.

01:45:50.678 --> 01:45:52.930
Everything except
that part about the money.

01:45:53.014 --> 01:45:54.766
What'll we do
about that?

01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:56.768
We've come this far,
haven't we?

01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:58.603
This is just
the beginning.

01:45:58.686 --> 01:46:00.438
And here's
to the beginning.

01:46:00.521 --> 01:46:01.939
I'll drink to that.

01:46:02.023 --> 01:46:03.107
To the beginning.

01:46:04.359 --> 01:46:06.110
