00:01.468 --> 00:01.901
This is the

00:01.901 --> 00:02.602
This is
the Evergreen Forest.

00:03.336 --> 00:03.603
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:05.939 --> 00:09.976
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:09.976 --> 00:11.711
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.146 --> 00:15.248
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:15.849 --> 00:16.950
Yikes!

00:17.684 --> 00:19.019
Yaaaah...

00:21.988 --> 00:23.356
Yeaaaah!

00:23.356 --> 00:26.426
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.136
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.570 --> 00:38.872
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.778
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.879 --> 00:47.013
the Raccoons!!

01:01.694 --> 01:04.130
On a beautiful
Evergreen Forest evening,

01:04.130 --> 01:08.668
the moon is full, the breeze
is warm and all is calm.

01:08.668 --> 01:12.005
Even Sneer Mansion seems
to be quiet and peaceful

01:12.005 --> 01:16.709
on the outside, but perhaps,
all is not as it seems.

01:16.709 --> 01:19.145
Uh-oh-uh-oh!

01:19.145 --> 01:20.547
This is terrible!

01:20.547 --> 01:22.048
Tragedy!!!

01:22.048 --> 01:23.583
Guys...

01:24.517 --> 01:26.386
We're in... oh...

01:26.386 --> 01:27.720
Oh, it's two?

01:27.720 --> 01:30.323
This is it guys! The gig is up!

01:30.323 --> 01:32.425
Pig 2: What are
you talking about?

01:32.425 --> 01:33.526
The Pig 1: This!!!

01:33.526 --> 01:36.529
It's a bill from the
Mammoth Power Company!

01:36.529 --> 01:38.431
Pig 2: So what?!

01:38.431 --> 01:39.933
We have hundreds of bills.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.303
Pig 1: But, but
this is a final notice!

01:43.303 --> 01:45.939
If this bill is not paid now,

01:45.939 --> 01:49.142
your power will be
cut off immediately,

01:49.142 --> 01:53.046
and you owe 800% in interest.

01:53.513 --> 01:55.849
Pig 3: 800% ?!

01:55.849 --> 01:59.018
Pig 1: I told you, we should
have paid the first bill!

01:59.018 --> 02:01.888
Pig 2: If we paid it, the boss
would have found out about

02:01.888 --> 02:04.624
the extra power
for your night light.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.192
Pig 1: My night light?!

02:06.192 --> 02:08.561
What about your
electric hoofbrush?

02:08.561 --> 02:10.797
Pig 2: Hm! What about him?

02:10.797 --> 02:12.198
The Pig 3: Me?!

02:12.198 --> 02:14.834
This bakey-bits skin tonner

02:14.834 --> 02:19.472
is a marvel of electrical
conservation and efficiency.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.941
Pig 2: Baky-bits skin tonner?

02:21.941 --> 02:24.978
You fool!! That's bacon curer!!

02:24.978 --> 02:26.246
Pig 3: Yowww!

02:26.246 --> 02:29.182
I want you flat-faced
porkers up here immediately!

02:30.817 --> 02:31.985
Pig 3: Ohh no!

02:31.985 --> 02:33.953
TV announcer:
And now it's time for

02:33.953 --> 02:36.055
"Steal a Fortune!"

02:36.055 --> 02:37.490
Ah-haaa!

02:37.490 --> 02:39.592
My favorite program!

02:39.592 --> 02:41.628
Where is my...?

02:41.628 --> 02:44.931
Pig 2: Reception committee
at your disposal, Sir.

02:44.931 --> 02:47.567
TV announcer:
...a brand new automobile...

02:47.567 --> 02:50.803
Hey, lower!
Little to the left!

02:50.803 --> 02:53.006
Freeze! Ha-haa!

02:53.006 --> 02:54.307
TV announcer:
...master of ceremonies today...

02:55.341 --> 02:57.744
Pig 1: Now we're done for.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.679
Who turned
off the power?!

02:59.679 --> 03:01.314
I'll have his hide!

03:01.314 --> 03:05.685
Uuuh, oh, ouch!

03:05.685 --> 03:09.355
Pig 1: Well Sir, it might have
something to do with... um,

03:09.355 --> 03:11.457
Mammoth Power.

03:11.457 --> 03:12.892
What?! Mammoth?

03:12.892 --> 03:15.862
How dare he interrupt
my favorite show!

03:18.064 --> 03:20.033
Pig 1: Ehm... Well,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.669
perhaps it has
to do with the...

03:22.669 --> 03:26.773
...small matter of an... unpaid

03:26.773 --> 03:29.943
bill, (giggles) Sir.

03:30.843 --> 03:34.180
No one interrupts my
television show! No one!!

03:34.180 --> 03:38.384
Oh no, Sir! No one, ever!

03:38.384 --> 03:42.222
Well... Mammoth has just
upset the balance of power

03:42.222 --> 03:45.692
for the last time.
Now, who's got a match?

03:45.692 --> 03:48.127
Me, Sir, right here, Sir.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.999
The Raccoon-dominium
is abuzz this sunny morning

03:52.999 --> 03:55.001
as Ralph and Melissa
prepare themselves

03:55.001 --> 03:57.337
for a long awaited vacation.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.906
Ralph, I think we've
got everything we need

03:59.906 --> 04:01.140
for our canoe trip.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.809
Yeah, Ralphie, uh,

04:02.809 --> 04:05.345
as an experienced explorer,

04:05.345 --> 04:08.514
I can tell you,
you gotta travel light.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.516
Oh yeah,
that reminds me,

04:10.516 --> 04:13.086
here Bert, pack these,
they'll come in handy.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.455
Oh no!

04:15.455 --> 04:17.357
Hey, listen to this,

04:17.357 --> 04:19.759
'100 different moose calls',

04:19.759 --> 04:22.195
'Travel by the stars',

04:22.195 --> 04:25.064
'Official history
of the can opener'.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.935
Oh boy, am I looking
forward to this trip

04:28.935 --> 04:30.470
to the great outdoors.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.373
I just love roughing it!

04:33.373 --> 04:36.542
Yeah, and you
won't even have cable!

04:36.542 --> 04:38.544
Well, that's it, Melissa.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.780
Now we're ready for anything!

04:40.780 --> 04:44.050
Are you certain you'll
be fine on your own, Bert?

04:44.050 --> 04:46.686
Aah, don't
worry about me, Melissa.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.722
Cedric and I are
gonna hike, swim, fish,

04:49.722 --> 04:52.125
bike and play some ball,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.227
and then after lunch,

04:54.227 --> 04:56.562
we'll catch a couple of movies,
and uh,

04:56.562 --> 04:58.364
climb Freans Peak.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.566
You know, relaxing stuff.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.902
There! It all fits,

05:02.902 --> 05:04.604
and it's as light as a feather!

05:06.572 --> 05:08.107
That must be Cedric.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.245
Gertie Raccoon:
Hi Melissa, Ralph?

05:12.245 --> 05:15.515
Oh-uh. Hi, aunt Gertie!

05:15.515 --> 05:17.650
It's so
good to see you!

05:18.017 --> 05:21.821
Uhm... aunt Gertie, we
were just... expecting you.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.757
She's not supposed to
arrive here till the 18th!

05:24.757 --> 05:25.792
Huh?

05:26.459 --> 05:28.828
Today is the 18th, Ralph!

05:28.828 --> 05:30.263
Oh no!

05:30.263 --> 05:32.065
And this must be Bert.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.400
I've heard so much about you.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.735
Ah yeah.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.304
Pleased to meet you.
Can I get you a wheelchair?

05:38.304 --> 05:39.672
I mean, I mean a chair?

05:39.672 --> 05:42.709
It's OK,
my legs still work, dear.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.312
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were just about

05:46.312 --> 05:47.814
to go on a canoe trip.

05:47.814 --> 05:49.816
Well, I...

05:49.816 --> 05:51.818
The truth is,
aunt Gertie,

05:51.818 --> 05:53.686
we were just on our way.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.988
I guess Ralph forgot
you were coming.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.990
But it's
no problem, really.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.692
We'll just go next week.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.795
I won't hear of it!
You've made plans to go,

06:02.795 --> 06:05.131
and you're not going to
change them just for me.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.033
But we can't
leave you here alone.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.268
I'm sure
I'll be just fine.

06:09.268 --> 06:11.804
And besides, young Bert
here can keep me company.

06:11.804 --> 06:13.373
We'll go strolling in the woods,

06:13.373 --> 06:14.907
pick some berries,

06:14.907 --> 06:17.543
classify plants, and maybe even

06:17.543 --> 06:20.980
whip up a batch of my special
peanut butter fudge.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.649
Peanut butter fudge?

06:23.649 --> 06:25.318
Now, you two get along!

06:25.318 --> 06:27.520
Well, I don't know.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.955
Oh yeah! Bye!

06:28.955 --> 06:30.523
Arrivederci!

06:30.523 --> 06:32.492
Ciao, have a good time, eh!

06:32.492 --> 06:34.394
Hey, the day's going
long, you know?

06:34.394 --> 06:36.095
There's no time
like the present.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.197
Melissa/Ralph: Uhm...
bye aunt Gertie!

06:38.197 --> 06:40.600
Don't forget
to write! Goodbye!

06:41.567 --> 06:45.338
Now, did you say
something about

06:45.338 --> 06:47.640
peanut butter fudge?

06:49.909 --> 06:53.012
Of course, you're
absolutely right, Mammoth.

06:53.012 --> 06:56.749
It is a princely sum and a
payment this big

06:56.749 --> 06:59.352
deserves a little ceremony.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.922
So why don't you
come and collect in person?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.323
We'll make a day of it.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.526
A little picnic, little music,

07:06.526 --> 07:09.362
and I'll see that you get
what's coming to you.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.831
Fine, I'll see you then!

07:13.199 --> 07:15.868
You'll get what's coming to you
all right, Mammoth!

07:15.868 --> 07:17.603
The shock of your life!

07:17.603 --> 07:20.540
Because I'm going to erect
the biggest dam ever built!

07:20.540 --> 07:24.544
Not only will there be enough
power for Sneer Industries,

07:24.544 --> 07:27.280
but I'll put you
out of business!

07:29.916 --> 07:33.419
Pig 1: OK, let's go
over this one more time.

07:33.419 --> 07:36.155
First we block off
the river upstream.

07:36.155 --> 07:39.292
Pig 2: That's phase one.
Pig 3: That's phase one.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.694
Pig 1: Right,
that holds back the river

07:41.694 --> 07:43.729
so we can build the dam here.

07:43.729 --> 07:47.567
Pig 2: That's phase two.
Pig 3: That's phase two.

07:47.567 --> 07:51.571
Pig 1: Right, then we'll
put the pylons over there.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.173
Pig 2: Stuts, beams
and conduits there

07:54.173 --> 07:56.943
Pig 3: And... the turbine there!

07:56.943 --> 07:59.745
Pig 1: But, first things first.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.113
The Pig 2&3: Right!

08:01.113 --> 08:02.815
The Pigs: Lunch!

08:02.815 --> 08:05.918
Pig 2:
This job should take months,

08:05.918 --> 08:08.621
maybe even years.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.059
Pig 1: Yes, Sir.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.096
48 hours to build the dam.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.131
That's a good one, Sir!

08:19.131 --> 08:21.334
Isn't that a good one, boys?

08:23.503 --> 08:24.937
That's no joke!!

08:24.937 --> 08:28.608
Pig 1: No, no you're right Sir,
that that's no joke!

08:29.242 --> 08:31.444
Lunch break's over!

08:33.546 --> 08:35.948
Gee, aunt Gertie,
all that baking

08:35.948 --> 08:38.251
must have really
tuckered you out.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.653
Can I get you a pillow
for your bunions?

08:40.653 --> 08:43.089
Eh, perhaps
a little prune tea?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.858
Bert? I'm a little
tougher than you think.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.260
Oh yeah, I'm sure you are,

08:47.260 --> 08:50.196
but, we'll talk about it
after your nap.

08:51.063 --> 08:53.299
Say, would you like
a glass for your teeth?

08:55.768 --> 08:57.937
Hi Bert,
ready to go hiking?

08:57.937 --> 08:59.272
Shhhh!

08:59.272 --> 09:01.340
It's aunt Gertie,
she's very old.

09:01.340 --> 09:03.643
She's having a nap.
No, I'm not!

09:04.510 --> 09:06.946
And who's this fine pink fellow?

09:06.946 --> 09:10.049
I'm Cedric Sneer.
I'm pleased to meet you.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.117
Woof-woof!

09:11.117 --> 09:13.052
Oh, and this is Broo.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.854
What's this
about a hike, boys?

09:14.854 --> 09:18.357
Ohh Bert and I are going
to hike on Evergreen Mountain.

09:18.357 --> 09:21.227
Oh, Cedric is talking
about the price hike

09:21.227 --> 09:23.796
on, ehm, chocolate pudding.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.731
Hiking
is my middle name.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.301
Mine is Sydney.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.735
We could do
some bird watching!

09:29.735 --> 09:31.704
I just have to pack
a few essentials... eh,

09:31.704 --> 09:33.239
I'll be back in a flash!

09:33.239 --> 09:35.041
Yahoooo!!!

09:35.041 --> 09:37.843
Bird watching?!

09:37.843 --> 09:41.147
Oh boy, I hope we
can take the strain.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.482
Yeah!

09:43.482 --> 09:45.718
Well,
let's get a move on!

09:50.089 --> 09:52.858
Wow, the great outdoors!

09:52.858 --> 09:55.661
Fresh air, peaceful waters!

09:55.661 --> 09:57.563
Nature at its best!

09:57.563 --> 10:02.401
Isn't it great that we
can share all this together?

10:02.401 --> 10:03.836
Wowwww!

10:03.836 --> 10:05.071
Ouch!

10:05.071 --> 10:07.006
Never stand
in a canoe, Ralph.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.341
It could be dangerous.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.278
Melissa, I think it's
time we started looking

10:12.278 --> 10:14.747
for a place to set up
camp for the night.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.216
We've only
been gone a few hours.

10:17.216 --> 10:20.653
Well, you don't want to
overdo it on the first day.

10:20.653 --> 10:24.557
Hmm... I wonder how things are
back at the Raccoon-dominium.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.430
Cedric/Bert:

10:31.430 --> 10:36.469
Aunt... Gertie,
maybe you should rest.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.105
You look a little... tired.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.407
Yeah... exhausted!

10:41.407 --> 10:42.908
Look boys, there's a

10:42.908 --> 10:45.077
very yellow breasted
knee-slapper!

10:45.578 --> 10:47.747
Boys? Boys?!

10:47.747 --> 10:50.549
Boys, now that you mention it,

10:50.549 --> 10:52.718
it seems like a good
time for a break.

10:52.718 --> 10:54.153
Cedric/Bert:

10:55.254 --> 10:57.256
Here's some juice
and a little ice,

10:57.256 --> 10:58.557
some chocolate pudding and...

10:58.557 --> 11:00.660
Chocolate pudding?!

11:00.660 --> 11:02.662
I've always
found it comes in handy

11:02.662 --> 11:04.096
in the wilds
of the forest.

11:04.096 --> 11:08.934
Boy, this'll be a lot
easier than bird watching.

11:13.973 --> 11:16.342
Pig 2: Uh,
that's the last of it!

11:16.342 --> 11:19.111
Pig 1: When we unleash
this water tomorrow,

11:19.111 --> 11:23.082
there will be enough electricity
to make the lights on Broadway

11:23.082 --> 11:25.284
look like a 10-watt bulb!

11:26.652 --> 11:27.987
Get the lead out!

11:27.987 --> 11:29.989
You bears are slower
than the service

11:29.989 --> 11:31.524
in a French restaurant.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.293
Pig 3: But Sir,
the entire crew has been

11:34.293 --> 11:38.164
working all night,
they can't work any faster!

11:38.164 --> 11:39.999
Pig 2: That's correct, Sir.

11:39.999 --> 11:44.403
Engineering statistics indicate
the dam, such as this,

11:44.403 --> 11:48.107
take 100 times more
bear's hours to build

11:48.107 --> 11:49.675
than you're allowing.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.877
Unless you
meet that deadline,

11:51.877 --> 11:55.281
you'll become an engineering
statistic! Capiche?

11:55.281 --> 11:57.683
I want you to move
at double speed.

11:57.683 --> 12:01.520
We're going to open on schedule
and when Mammoth turns up

12:01.520 --> 12:03.389
at our little gala opening,

12:03.389 --> 12:06.058
he'll see who holds the power!

12:07.693 --> 12:10.062
Alright,
boys, rise and shine.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.764
The day's almost over.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.599
Almost over!?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.769
What time is?
6:15!

12:16.769 --> 12:18.804
6:15?!?

12:18.804 --> 12:22.108
Yep! I've got a great
expedition planned for us today.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.577
Please! No more strolls.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.379
I've walked more
than a 300 hitter.

12:27.379 --> 12:30.182
Don't worry Bert, you
won't have to take a step.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.520
How can you have an
expedition without walking?

12:34.520 --> 12:36.088
Uhg?!

12:36.088 --> 12:37.356
What's that?

12:39.024 --> 12:42.361
Meet Betsy, boys!
Isn't she a beaut...?

12:42.361 --> 12:45.598
Ugh, Gertie, isn't a
motor bike a little risky

12:45.598 --> 12:48.100
for someone your.. ugh.. age?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.635
Nonsense!!

12:49.635 --> 12:52.438
Betsy and I have been
getting along just fine

12:52.438 --> 12:54.573
together for quite some time.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.411
Well, what are you
waiting for, Pinkie? Hop in!

12:59.411 --> 13:01.113
Well, um...

13:01.113 --> 13:02.782
I'd rather not!

13:02.782 --> 13:06.085
Master Cedric, your father
requests your presence

13:06.085 --> 13:08.721
immediately for
his gala opening!

13:08.721 --> 13:10.222
A gala opening?

13:10.222 --> 13:13.392
Well, I wish I could go along
for the ride, aunt Gertie,

13:13.392 --> 13:14.960
but duty calls...

13:14.960 --> 13:16.428
See you later, bye.

13:16.428 --> 13:17.930
Bye bye, Pinky.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.433
Well, it looks
like, it's you and me.

13:21.433 --> 13:23.869
Are you sure you don't
want me to drive?

13:23.869 --> 13:25.938
I think I
can handle it, Bert.

13:25.938 --> 13:28.274
I have for the last 40 years.

13:28.274 --> 13:29.775
40...years?!

13:29.775 --> 13:32.111
OK, then, off we go.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.880
Let her rip, Aunt Gertie!

13:34.880 --> 13:37.316

Bert. Here we go!

a great night's sleep.

refreshed out here.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.831

pitching the tent

is going on here.
