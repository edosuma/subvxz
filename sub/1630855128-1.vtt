00:58.623 --> 01:03.063
Hey Siri, send a
message to Cheryl.

01:03.106 --> 01:03.933
Front reception.

01:06.327 --> 01:07.023
What do you want to say?

01:08.938 --> 01:11.680
Amos is already heading
there to pick him up, period.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.856
Please forward any calls
I get to Brady, period.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.902
Your message to
Cheryl front reception

01:16.946 --> 01:19.253
says Amos is already heading
there to pick him up.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.906
Please forward any calls
I get to Brady.

01:21.516 --> 01:22.299
Ready to send it?

01:22.778 --> 01:23.561
Yes.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.086
Okay, it's sent.

01:27.957 --> 01:28.827
Hey, Siri,

01:31.178 --> 01:33.005
how do you know if you're
doing the right thing?

01:35.182 --> 01:36.357
I'm not sure
I understand.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.666
But what do you believe

01:41.710 --> 01:43.407
is the difference between
right and wrong?

01:45.540 --> 01:46.758
Hmm.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.108
I don't have an answer for that.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.979
Would you like me to
search the web?

01:51.023 --> 01:51.763
No.

01:53.243 --> 01:55.289
Okay, is there
something else I can help with?

02:04.863 --> 02:06.430
Set a reminder to pick up Kyle

02:06.474 --> 02:08.650
from therapy tomorrow at 4:45.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.132
Okay, I'll remind you.

02:34.023 --> 02:36.330
Hi, special agent Deena Helms.

02:36.373 --> 02:37.418
You've already met
Agent McCullough.

02:37.461 --> 02:38.854
You can call me Amos.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.639
-Uh, agents?
-Have a seat for us, Gareth.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.774
Do you mind answering a
couple questions?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.430
Great, this shouldn't take long.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.564
You're from Tampa, right?

02:56.176 --> 02:57.568
Don't overthink it.
It's a yes or no.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.223
Yeah.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.616
How old are you, Gareth?

03:01.659 --> 03:02.530
29.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.184
What do you do for work?

03:04.227 --> 03:05.533
I'm sorry, am I being detained?

03:05.576 --> 03:06.838
No, not at all.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.753
We're just asking
questions, background stuff.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.147
You work on movies, right?

03:12.061 --> 03:12.888
Special effects.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.630
Someone told me you worked

03:15.673 --> 03:17.153
on that new "Star Wars"
movie, is that right?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.459
Who told you that?

03:18.502 --> 03:20.287
Why don't you tell us
more about it?

03:20.330 --> 03:21.288
Tell us about your work.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.770
I used to do VFX for an
animation company.

03:25.814 --> 03:26.858
I've worked on at least
20 different films.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.164
Used to?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.470
I've been focusing more

03:29.513 --> 03:30.688
on software engineering
recently for years-

03:30.732 --> 03:32.386
Sounds boring compared
to light sabers.

03:32.429 --> 03:33.648
Why quit?

03:33.691 --> 03:34.779
I wasn't
getting paid well.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.085
But money's not an
issue for you.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.304
Excuse me?

03:37.347 --> 03:38.218
What kind of
effects did you do?

03:38.261 --> 03:39.610
Money's not an issue for me?

03:39.654 --> 03:40.829
-Let's talk about-
-If money wasn't an issue for me

03:40.872 --> 03:41.917
I wouldn't have applied
for your grant.

03:41.960 --> 03:42.613
I didn't mean to
suggest anything.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.225
Tell us what kind of
effects you did.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.142
My main focus was on
3D renderings.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.274
Of what?

03:51.318 --> 03:52.275
-Actors.
-What for?

03:53.058 --> 03:54.321
Well, for "Star Wars,"

03:54.364 --> 03:55.844
it was because the actor
I was tasked to digitize

03:55.887 --> 03:57.280
was unavailable to be
filmed in person.

03:58.020 --> 03:58.542
Why?

04:00.065 --> 04:00.892
Because they were dead.

04:02.894 --> 04:03.765
What'd they have you do?

04:05.941 --> 04:08.117
I reconstructed Alec
Guinness' face as a 3D model.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.727
I analyzed reference footage,

04:09.771 --> 04:11.599
then used a process called
D-Term to procedurally generate

04:11.642 --> 04:12.861
his bone and muscle structures,

04:12.904 --> 04:14.254
which one rigged helped
the animation feel

04:14.297 --> 04:15.559
more natural and human-like.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.779
D-Term, I've never heard
of that process before.

04:17.822 --> 04:18.910
Because I invented it.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.172
So you're
basically bringing

04:20.216 --> 04:21.478
dead actors back to life?

04:21.522 --> 04:22.958
I just tried to make
the CG characters look as

04:23.001 --> 04:24.612
photorealistic as the technology
at the time would allow.

04:24.655 --> 04:25.526
You didn't
find it creepy?

04:26.570 --> 04:27.354
I'm sorry, what?

04:28.398 --> 04:29.356
I said you don't find
that creepy?

04:32.010 --> 04:34.404
Well, we did our best to
cross the uncanny valley.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.014
But when the human
brain perceives

04:36.058 --> 04:37.277
that something is just slightly
off and it doesn't matter-

04:37.320 --> 04:38.321
No, I mean,
digitizing dead people.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.496
Christ, I mean, it's,

04:39.540 --> 04:40.889
it's almost like turning
someone's corpse

04:40.932 --> 04:42.064
into a marionette, you know?

04:42.107 --> 04:43.283
Making them do
whatever you want.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.110
What if the poor dead guy

04:45.154 --> 04:46.590
didn't want to be in
another fucking movie?

04:47.417 --> 04:48.244
It's so macabre.

04:48.810 --> 04:49.898
Am I crazy? Is it not macabre?

04:49.941 --> 04:51.029
I don't think the studio cares

04:51.073 --> 04:52.204
whether it's macabre or not.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.423
Look, I can never tell
the difference.

04:53.467 --> 04:54.990
I always can.
The faces look like Play-Doh.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.165
Well, we did our best.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.340
Soon we won't even need actors,right?

04:57.384 --> 04:58.689
Everyone will just be digital.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.387
No, you still need them
for motion tracking.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.432
Human performances can't be
completely computer generated.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.520
How long will that be true?

05:07.698 --> 05:09.570
Some might say we've already
crossed that threshold.

05:11.398 --> 05:12.312
I wouldn't know.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.620
Where'd you go to school?

05:16.664 --> 05:18.274
-Brooks-DeBartolo High.
-And after?

05:20.145 --> 05:21.408
Nothing?

05:21.451 --> 05:22.322
What about Columbia?

05:22.365 --> 05:23.279
Didn't you go to Columbia?

05:25.629 --> 05:27.109
Wait, no.
You dropped out of Columbia

05:27.152 --> 05:29.416
after how many semesters?

05:29.981 --> 05:30.765
Three?

05:33.071 --> 05:35.944
Bjarne Stroustrup said

05:35.987 --> 05:37.162
you were the smartest
kid he ever met.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.384
I don't know who he is, but
Amos says it's a big deal.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.734
Then you moved to the
Netherlands,

05:44.518 --> 05:46.041
spent some time as an intern,

05:46.781 --> 05:47.999
applied and got into Cambridge.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.001
Very nice.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.307
Except that you dropped
out after two years.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.570
Flew back to the States,

05:53.614 --> 05:56.007
interned in Palo Alto,
then Montreal.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.618
Then went all the way
back to England,

05:57.661 --> 05:59.141
where you landed a job
in Sheffield.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.882
Second job in Manchester.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.146
Then got into Oxford where you
almost finished your masters

06:04.189 --> 06:05.408
before ditching the graduation

06:05.452 --> 06:06.931
and moving back here to Florida.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.763
If money was an issue,

06:14.635 --> 06:16.376
I'm glad you had plenty
of flyer miles.

06:18.465 --> 06:19.640
I didn't hear a question.

06:20.815 --> 06:21.598
What's your social life like?

06:22.817 --> 06:24.601
My, what does that have
anything to do-

06:24.645 --> 06:26.081
If you don't want to talk
about it, that's fine.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.387
We just wanted to know if
you have friends and stuff.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.997
-I have friends.
-A lot of them?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.259
-I have friends.
-Can you name one?

06:30.302 --> 06:31.434
-Can I what?
-Can you tell us the nam

06:31.478 --> 06:32.566
of just one of your friends?

06:33.523 --> 06:35.612
-Steve.
-Steve. Steve what?

06:35.656 --> 06:36.961
I don't know how this is
relevant to receiving the grant.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.354
Oh, we're just getting
to know you, Gareth.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.312
You got a girlfriend?

06:40.922 --> 06:41.749
Boyfriend?

06:42.489 --> 06:44.273
You, uh, talk to people online?

06:44.316 --> 06:45.405
I don't know what you
mean by that.

06:45.448 --> 06:46.710
I don't use social media.

06:46.754 --> 06:47.842
I mean more like chat rooms.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.022
You go on any chat rooms?

06:58.896 --> 07:00.245
No one uses chat rooms anymore.

07:00.985 --> 07:01.638
Sure they do.

07:03.771 --> 07:04.772
You chat with anyone online?

07:07.514 --> 07:08.689
-Sometimes.
-Sometimes.

07:10.212 --> 07:11.953
What kinds of people
do you talk to online?

07:14.085 --> 07:18.176
Gareth, obviously, this
isn't about a grant.

07:19.395 --> 07:20.570
We need to know
what your alias is.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.052
When you go online, what
name do you use?

07:24.095 --> 07:25.314
I don't have one.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.141
Yes, you do.

07:27.185 --> 07:27.969
And you need to tell
us what it is.

07:33.801 --> 07:34.889
Sorry, I can't help you.

07:45.813 --> 07:46.857
You know who we are?

07:48.946 --> 07:50.600
Well, this is the ICWL building.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.036
That's right.
You know what we do?

07:53.429 --> 07:54.561
Humanitarian work.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.779
That's what the
people upstairs do.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.389
You know what we do?

08:02.307 --> 08:03.744
We catch pedophiles.

08:06.007 --> 08:09.358
Amos here specializes in
tracking down online predators.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.360
He spends every waking hour

08:11.403 --> 08:14.015
scouring those chat
rooms you say no one uses

08:14.058 --> 08:16.670
and he finds thousands of
people soliciting children.

08:17.758 --> 08:20.500
Our operation is like a
tightly spun spider web

08:20.848 --> 08:23.633
connecting ICWL, the FBI, NSA,

08:23.677 --> 08:26.288
and let me tell you, his
team here is a vital thread.

08:27.289 --> 08:30.031
He reports everything he
gathers directly to me,

08:30.074 --> 08:32.207
and I see to it that the
necessary authorities

08:32.250 --> 08:33.382
take swift action.

08:33.774 --> 08:34.818
So are you in charge?

08:35.340 --> 08:36.864
This is my spiderweb.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.432
I'm the fucking spider, Gareth.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.961
Am I being detained?

08:47.831 --> 08:48.963
We already told you
that you're not detained.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.834
Good.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.055
But if you leave this
room, you will be arrested.

09:00.452 --> 09:01.410
For what?

09:04.065 --> 09:04.979
I told you what we do.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.546
Take a wild guess.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.158
I am not what
you think I am.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.202
We'll see.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.555
Gareth, you just gotta
tell us your alias.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.209
What's your username?

09:22.605 --> 09:23.388
Sit down.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.189
-Why do you do this with them?
-Hmm?

09:41.232 --> 09:42.843
There's no way you do this
with every suspect you have.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.453
Invite them to your headquarters

09:44.496 --> 09:45.585
and then drag them down
into a basement.

09:46.020 --> 09:46.586
That's right.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.066
Why are you doing
this to me then?

09:51.199 --> 09:52.592
You tell us, Gare.

09:52.635 --> 09:53.984
What makes you so fuckin'
special?

09:56.552 --> 09:57.422
I don't know.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.730
What's your alias?

10:00.774 --> 10:03.603
-I don't have an alias.
-Yes you do.

10:05.343 --> 10:06.518
It starts with the word hard.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.347
Just finish the rest.

10:11.698 --> 10:12.916
Sit down, Mr. Federson.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.483
I only have a few
more questions.

10:27.278 --> 10:28.802
Do you recognize this girl?

10:37.680 --> 10:41.336
Do you know her?

10:44.295 --> 10:45.166
Yes.

10:45.209 --> 10:46.080
What's her name?

10:47.081 --> 10:48.560
Cherry.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.258
-Cherry what?
-She doesn't have a last name.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.781
Yes, she does, Gareth,
she's not Madonna.

10:51.825 --> 10:53.304
-She's a little girl.
-You don't understand.

10:53.348 --> 10:54.436
Yeah, well, I'd like to.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.524
So help me out, is she
your daughter?

10:55.567 --> 10:57.439
-No.
-Then whose daughter is she?

10:57.482 --> 10:58.527
-She, she doesn't have--
-How did you meet her?

10:58.570 --> 10:59.963
I didn't meet her.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.661
Then why do you have photos
of her on your computer?

11:01.704 --> 11:02.618
What the hell are you
talking about?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.402
Why do you fucking have photos

11:04.446 --> 11:05.708
of this girl on your fucking-

11:05.752 --> 11:06.840
Are you looking at
my hard drive?

11:06.883 --> 11:08.102
Because that's an
invasion of privacy.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.407
So you know what photos
I'm talking about?

11:09.451 --> 11:10.321
You don't have to do
it this way.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.583
I gave you permission to sit in.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.629
I did not give you
permission to speak.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.761
This is insane,
you cannot keep-

11:14.804 --> 11:16.023
What else have you
done with her?

11:16.066 --> 11:17.372
-Nothing!
-Did you take the photos?

11:17.415 --> 11:18.286
It's, it's complicated.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.766
No, it's not! Yes or no?

11:19.809 --> 11:20.854
Did you take the photos?

11:20.897 --> 11:22.725
I didn't do anything wrong,
okay?

11:22.769 --> 11:25.772
Soliciting pornography of
minors is an egregious felony.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.731
Distributing that
pornography is tenfold worse.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.646
-I didn't do anything!
-Fucking prove it!

11:31.125 --> 11:33.562
What is your alias?

11:34.606 --> 11:35.912
Answer me!

11:35.956 --> 11:37.609
HardMachine11811.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.238
You're HardMachine.

11:59.414 --> 12:00.632
Thanks for confirming.

12:03.287 --> 12:05.768
If you knew, then why
do this to me?

12:05.812 --> 12:07.074
We weren't positive,

12:07.117 --> 12:08.423
and if you turned out
to not be HardMachine,

12:08.466 --> 12:09.729
you were obviously
just a predator.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.126
Do you keep track?

12:17.998 --> 12:20.565
I mean, do you know how many
bad people you've nailed?

12:21.175 --> 12:23.046
I didn't start
counting until 2023.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.527
196 convictions.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.833
There were at least 30

12:26.876 --> 12:27.747
before I started sending
everything to you guys.

12:28.486 --> 12:29.400
What'd you do before?

12:29.836 --> 12:30.924
I turned over

12:30.967 --> 12:31.925
all evidence directly
to the police.

12:31.968 --> 12:32.795
Why'd you stop?

12:33.187 --> 12:34.014
They were unreliable.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.668
-I doubt that.
-More than half of the predators

12:36.712 --> 12:38.018
I identified went
un-investigated.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.671
Yeah, well, you were
sketchy and faceless.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.021
They had every right to
be skeptical.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.414
It would've all been for nothing

12:43.458 --> 12:44.894
if they found out you were
using a little girl as bait.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.113
It's not that simple, okay?

12:46.156 --> 12:48.768
I can only do what I do
with anonymity.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.770
Here's my problem, Gareth,
and don't get me wrong.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.510
I think 200 terrible
people behind bars

12:52.554 --> 12:54.643
is a very good thing,
but not at her expense.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.037
Look, we think we can help you,

12:57.733 --> 12:59.169
but we need to help her too.

12:59.213 --> 13:02.477
Using your daughter to
entrap these people

13:02.520 --> 13:03.608
is a means that does not
justify the ends.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.001
She's not my daughter.

13:05.045 --> 13:06.394
And in spite of what you
may think you've achieved,

13:06.437 --> 13:07.569
I still have no reservation
with locking you up.

13:07.612 --> 13:08.526
You took the photos.

13:09.005 --> 13:09.876
I don't care why.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.268
You don't understand.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.096
Who is she?

13:13.140 --> 13:14.794
You're gonna ruin everything.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.535
She's a child, Gareth,
look at me.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.802
I don't give a damn what
fucked up anti-hero master plan

13:22.845 --> 13:23.759
of yours I might jeopardize.

13:24.368 --> 13:25.979
I won't let her be exploited.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.763
Not even for the sake of
locking up more perverts.

13:29.286 --> 13:31.375
I'm asking you politely
to let this one go.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.551
Are you fucking slow?

13:33.900 --> 13:35.031
Have you been listening at all?

13:35.075 --> 13:37.599
My anonymity is my most
important asset.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.253
Without that, I can't
do what I do.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.863
Well, that makes
everything easy then.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.606
You tell us where she is,
or we leak everything.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.129
-Your name, your aliases.
-Deena!

13:46.173 --> 13:48.218
Every single perp you
helped us catch.

13:48.262 --> 13:50.133
I'm sure they'll be very
pleased to meet you in jail.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.352
Stop!

13:51.395 --> 13:52.092
Okay.

13:55.835 --> 13:56.836
Look, if I tell you
about Cherry, okay,

13:58.054 --> 13:59.055
there's some things I'm
gonna need first.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.189
It doesn't really work like
that, Gareth, but go ahead.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.799
Give us your wishlist.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.322
I need a signed non-disclosure
agreement from both of you.

14:05.366 --> 14:06.628
-Not gonna happen.
-And then I need you to swear

14:06.671 --> 14:07.803
that the information I'm
about to relay

14:07.847 --> 14:08.760
won't leave this room.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.545
Look, if you tell us anything

14:10.588 --> 14:11.720
that could help us
locate Cherry,

14:11.763 --> 14:13.591
you know we can't keep
that promise.

14:15.332 --> 14:16.899
Okay, if I tell you anything

14:16.943 --> 14:19.510
that potentially helps
you find a missing child,

14:19.771 --> 14:20.772
okay, you can feel free
to share that.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.035
But I need you to swear

14:22.078 --> 14:24.472
that any other details
about myself or Cherry,

14:25.952 --> 14:27.127
have to stay between
the three of us.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.173
Is that it?

14:32.697 --> 14:33.742
And I need that camera
switched off.

14:35.918 --> 14:36.963
I don't know
how to do that.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.573
Go to the head of
securities office,

14:38.616 --> 14:39.922
ask him to find this camera
in the system and disable it.

14:40.836 --> 14:41.924
I don't think he's
allowed to do that.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.622
I thought you were the
fucking spider?

14:49.192 --> 14:50.585
Give me a reason, Gareth.

14:50.628 --> 14:51.760
Why should I go through
all the trouble

14:51.803 --> 14:52.935
of getting that
camera turned off?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.808
Because if anybody finds out
what I'm about to tell you,

14:58.723 --> 15:00.551
a thousand more children
are gonna get abused.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.382
Give me a minute.

15:21.007 --> 15:26.403
So, uh, you and Cherry hunted
all those people together?

15:34.020 --> 15:36.979
This one time I spent six
weeks undercover trying

15:37.023 --> 15:39.199
to nail down a single
trafficker from the Philippines.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.506
Day after day,

15:42.550 --> 15:45.683
I spent hour after hour
following his trail online.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.163
And he must have been

15:47.207 --> 15:48.948
one of the hardest targets
I ever had to track down.

15:52.038 --> 15:56.607
Then one day I found him and
one of Cherry's live streams.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.088
I mean, she went by a
different name in the stream,

15:59.132 --> 16:00.655
but it was her.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.179
The trafficker,

16:03.223 --> 16:04.528
along with three of our
other targets

16:04.572 --> 16:06.574
were all in the room together.

16:06.617 --> 16:12.101
All of them just carelessly
sharing their information.

16:13.798 --> 16:18.542
I mean, and they were so open
'cause she was a real girl.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.501
I mean, she could physically

16:20.544 --> 16:22.720
and verbally respond to
them in real time.

16:26.159 --> 16:32.034
A couple days later,
HardMachine11811 sends ICWL

16:32.078 --> 16:33.905
another batch of names
and evidence,

16:33.949 --> 16:36.996
including the three targets
that were in the room.

16:39.041 --> 16:42.001
You know, I almost thought
the girl was HardMachine

16:42.697 --> 16:44.351
and that this nine year old

16:44.394 --> 16:47.702
just happened to be some
badass online vigilante.

16:50.183 --> 16:51.314
What changed your mind?

16:54.970 --> 16:56.363
11811.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.323
January 18th, 2011.

17:01.324 --> 17:05.154
Most of my team thought it
was, uh, some arbitrary number,

17:06.677 --> 17:10.116
but I remember what happened
on that day in Clearwater.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.034
You were one of the
Clearwater kids, weren't you?

17:16.774 --> 17:19.777
You know, my father was
a part of that raid.

17:22.476 --> 17:23.520
It's off, see?

17:23.564 --> 17:24.217
No red light.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.175
Non-disclosure agreements?

17:26.219 --> 17:27.611
We're not playing this game,
Gareth.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.048
You're just gonna have to
suck it up and trust us.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.228
You can trust us.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.667
I've been told I have
trust issues.

17:39.928 --> 17:41.756
Well, there's
only one way to fix that.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.332
The reason you can't
find Cherry,

17:53.333 --> 17:56.249
the reason why she doesn't
have a last name or parents,

17:56.510 --> 18:01.210
or a social security number
is because she's not real.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.605
She's not a real human being.

18:08.783 --> 18:09.784
Tell us what happened.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.616
While I was studying abroad,

18:15.877 --> 18:17.661
I interned at a small
Dutch animation studio

18:18.532 --> 18:19.968
a few years before
they collaborated

18:20.011 --> 18:21.535
with a local nonprofit on
a similar idea.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.102
Which was?

18:24.451 --> 18:26.148
The idea was to build a 3D model

18:26.192 --> 18:27.497
of an 11 year old Filipino girl

18:28.019 --> 18:30.500
and use her covertly to
identify online predators,

18:30.935 --> 18:32.981
A technological solution
to a technological problem.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.679
But the project was suspended
after only a few months.

18:35.723 --> 18:36.854
Yeah, I remember.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.029
I remember hearing
about that program.

18:38.639 --> 18:39.640
Is that what inspired you?

18:41.076 --> 18:42.077
As I got better at crafting
photorealistic faces,

18:42.121 --> 18:43.600
I decided to work on one myself.

18:43.644 --> 18:44.427
Why?

18:45.689 --> 18:47.865
It was too effective
of an idea to let die.

18:47.909 --> 18:49.563
Hundreds of thousands
of children are at risk.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.042
I had to make her.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.609
Who is she modeled after?

18:52.653 --> 18:53.349
No one, I built
her from scratch.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.221
Scratch?

18:55.264 --> 18:57.310
I started with a skull,
designed her bone structure,

18:57.353 --> 18:59.050
worked upwards through
muscles and tissue,

18:59.094 --> 19:00.922
used the D-Term program to
fill in the rest procedurally.

19:00.965 --> 19:04.186
Eventually she came to
look like that.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.667
A completely unique,
completely digital model.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.495
I rigged her face and body

19:08.538 --> 19:09.496
the way you would for
any CG character.

19:09.539 --> 19:10.714
Then for three years,

19:12.194 --> 19:13.021
I used motion tracking to
puppeteer her in real time.

19:14.588 --> 19:15.284
You gotta understand that the
video chats on those sites

19:15.328 --> 19:16.590
have such low resolution

19:16.633 --> 19:17.678
that even in her earliest
stage of this, she,

19:18.461 --> 19:21.290
we appeared
completely authentic.

19:22.683 --> 19:23.684
And what about voice?

19:25.033 --> 19:26.600
For most of her first
year, she had to be mute.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.210
But eventually I found a decent
voice filter with no lag.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.559
And after a few tweaks
and adjustments,

19:29.603 --> 19:31.257
it's been the same
voice ever since.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.781
I, I, I thought initially,

19:33.824 --> 19:36.000
my performance was going
to be too unnatural.

19:36.044 --> 19:39.917
But with just one week of
occasional video chat sessions,

19:40.831 --> 19:42.398
I secured six different names,

19:42.790 --> 19:44.531
mailing addresses,
proofs of solicitations.

19:46.010 --> 19:46.968
Cherry worked.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.796
So the photos on your computer?

19:48.839 --> 19:50.754
-Completely fake.
-It was the only way

19:50.798 --> 19:52.191
some of them disclosed
personal information.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.715
But it was all zeros and
ones, all digital, right?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.412
-There's no real child.
-No real child.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.284
Just a highly detailed
computer model.

19:58.675 --> 19:59.763
And let me be clear
about something,

20:01.069 --> 20:02.070
I derive no pleasure
from doing any of this.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.463
I've been asexual my
entire life.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.291
I, I don't even get a
sense of satisfaction

20:05.334 --> 20:06.509
from seeing these
people locked up.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.426
I just think kids deserve a
life free of exploitation.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.214
Incredible, all this time.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.520
I'm not gonna lie, Gareth.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.000
Cherry's done us a lot of good.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.742
You know, I still remember
what you said to me

20:21.785 --> 20:22.917
the first time we corresponded.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.398
-You said-
-We corresponded?

20:26.399 --> 20:27.226
Yeah, man.

20:27.922 --> 20:28.749
I'm Gord51.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.578
I'm the one here you've been
sending all your intel to.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.015
You're Gord?

20:34.929 --> 20:35.973
Yeah.

20:38.237 --> 20:38.889
You lied to me.

20:40.151 --> 20:42.066
You said I could stay anonymous.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.590
You said I would be safe.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.419
Now you've ruined everything.

20:47.637 --> 20:49.073
I, I didn't, I didn't
have a choice.

20:49.117 --> 20:50.292
You don't have to worry
about anything, Gareth.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.424
If Cherry isn't real,

20:51.467 --> 20:52.816
then you're not in any
trouble with us.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.559
In fact, we've discussed ideas
similar to this in the past,

20:56.907 --> 20:58.169
motion tracking and such.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.607
But we'd need a convincing
model like Cherry.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.695
Cherry's more than a model.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.000
You want to help children?
So do we.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.480
She's not for sale.

21:04.524 --> 21:05.916
Well, then just make us a
new model based off of her.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.135
I can't.

21:07.178 --> 21:07.701
Sure you can.

21:08.179 --> 21:08.963
I won't.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.228
What are you not telling us?

21:15.839 --> 21:17.319
It's out on the table now.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.103
Might as well spill whatever
it is you haven't already.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.502
You know what
doesn't make sense?

21:28.112 --> 21:31.028
You said that you puppeteered
her for only three years,

21:31.377 --> 21:33.509
but we've been getting
info from you ever since.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.860
In fact, I'm pretty
sure it was around then

21:36.904 --> 21:39.950
that we started seeing an
impressive increase of names.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.040
So many in fact that we
started thinking

21:44.433 --> 21:46.479
there's no way this is all
coming from one source.

21:46.522 --> 21:47.741
I have friends that do
mo-cap for me.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.570
Oh, friends, like Steve?

21:51.919 --> 21:53.529
I thought anonymity was
your greatest asset.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.925
Cut the bullshit, Gareth.

21:59.535 --> 22:00.971
What happened to Cherry
after three years?

22:07.804 --> 22:10.894
Okay, you said that she
was more than a model.

22:11.765 --> 22:15.334
So what is she some type
of conversational agent?

22:15.377 --> 22:17.423
Like a, like a chat bot?

22:17.771 --> 22:21.209
Chat bot.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.433
You know what happened
after three years?

22:28.259 --> 22:29.217
My chosen mother died.

22:30.523 --> 22:31.698
What she left behind was
enough to quit my job

22:31.741 --> 22:33.308
and pursue more
resources and software.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.092
I'd already made a program

22:35.136 --> 22:36.529
that could procedurally
generate faces,

22:36.572 --> 22:38.226
but what I wanted for
Cherry was far more complex.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.184
So I got in touch with
some researchers

22:40.228 --> 22:41.577
from Madrid who'd already built

22:41.621 --> 22:42.926
a predator hunting dialogue
system of their own.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.538
It was trained to approach
conversations as a game.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.496
Each sentence like a
strategic volley,

22:47.540 --> 22:48.976
which is innovative but
ultimately flawed.

22:49.019 --> 22:50.586
If you want your machine
to master NLP,

22:50.630 --> 22:51.631
you have to break
down game theory

22:51.674 --> 22:53.197
because language
isn't tic-tac-toe.

22:53.241 --> 22:54.329
It's poetry.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.678
So yes, I got things started

22:55.722 --> 22:57.027
with a preexisting
modified chat bot

22:57.071 --> 22:58.159
that I borrowed
without permission

22:58.202 --> 22:59.203
from the University of Deusto.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.385
But that's not what
Cherry is now.

23:10.040 --> 23:10.606
What is she, Gareth?

23:14.175 --> 23:15.698
She's one of the most complex

23:15.742 --> 23:17.744
and independently evolving
AIs that's ever been created.

23:18.701 --> 23:19.963
Artificial intelligence?

23:20.007 --> 23:21.530
She's already surpassed
the narrow intelligence

23:21.574 --> 23:23.663
of IBM's smartest programs.

23:23.706 --> 23:26.666
She can have full conversations,
up to 10 of them at a time,

23:26.970 --> 23:28.972
all while
simultaneously strategizing

23:29.016 --> 23:31.366
the most efficient schedule
to visit various chat rooms.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.325
She's perpetually studying
YouTube videos of small children

23:34.587 --> 23:36.197
in order to adopt a
growing library

23:36.240 --> 23:37.285
of mannerisms and movements

23:38.678 --> 23:39.548
which help keep her artificial
personality dynamic.

23:40.767 --> 23:41.985
Her fastest response time
is 0.4 seconds.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.117
And as of now, she has never,

23:43.509 --> 23:44.988
never been accused
of being fake,

23:45.032 --> 23:46.425
which means she shattered
the Turing test.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.252
All I do is
occasionally update her

23:48.296 --> 23:49.471
and periodically check
her data cleaning.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.341
Otherwise,

23:52.474 --> 23:53.736
she's completely on autopilot.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.221
Holy fucking shit.

24:04.617 --> 24:06.053
-How?
-Six years she's been active.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.750
Every minute she's online,
she's learning something.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.274
The more she learns, the
more advanced she becomes.

24:10.318 --> 24:11.493
This means increased
data generation,

24:11.537 --> 24:12.538
improved decision making,

24:12.581 --> 24:13.887
faster pattern and
trend detection

24:13.930 --> 24:15.366
and complex problem solving.

24:15.410 --> 24:18.326
NLP, IR, machine learning
to an unprecedented degree.

24:18.369 --> 24:19.719
She can teach herself anything

24:19.762 --> 24:21.155
she thinks will help
efficiency and authenticity.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.591
She can currently speak
four languages

24:24.245 --> 24:25.333
and by the end of this month,
she'll have mastered a fifth.

24:25.376 --> 24:26.247
There's no way you
could have pulled

24:26.290 --> 24:27.291
all this off on your own.

24:31.252 --> 24:32.035
You're right.

24:34.211 --> 24:35.343
Would you believe me
if I told you

24:35.386 --> 24:38.302
it was somewhat of an accident?

24:40.391 --> 24:41.915
Look, if, if I'm being honest,

24:43.438 --> 24:44.874
I'm not entirely sure
how I did it

24:46.485 --> 24:47.660
with the first year of coding

24:47.703 --> 24:48.878
and the second year of
data training,

24:49.966 --> 24:52.708
I just pushed a wheel
down a hill.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.449
It was like gravity
did the rest.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.410
Her evolution became
perpetual, exponentially so.

25:01.630 --> 25:04.677
The more time she was
online, the faster she grew.

25:05.199 --> 25:06.592
You haven't shared
this with anyone?

25:06.635 --> 25:09.769
Like I said, my anonymity
is everything.

25:12.598 --> 25:13.512
What coding language?

25:14.469 --> 25:15.557
Standard C++.

25:15.862 --> 25:16.602
Does Brady know it?

25:19.996 --> 25:21.389
We'll sign
non-disclosures for you,

25:22.608 --> 25:24.000
but I want to see the
source code first.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.741
Out of the question.
You just want to steal her.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.874
No, I want to see how we
can make our own.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.179
You'll screw it up.

25:29.223 --> 25:30.572
Look, these, these
predators and traffickers,

25:30.616 --> 25:32.095
they all talk to each other,
okay?

25:32.139 --> 25:34.141
So much of Cherry's process
is just bypassing the VPNs

25:34.184 --> 25:36.317
and making sure she doesn't
double up in the same circles.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.710
The chat rooms begin to suspect

25:37.753 --> 25:39.189
that this technology is
even possible,

25:39.233 --> 25:40.321
they'll find a way to
circumvent that.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.670
We have to eliminate any
margin of error.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.106
-Cherry agrees with me.
-Cherry agrees?

25:43.150 --> 25:44.543
What the fuck does that-

25:44.586 --> 25:45.979
What I mean by that is that
the data she's collected

25:46.022 --> 25:47.284
validates that perspective.

25:47.328 --> 25:48.416
What, do you have little
chats with her over tea?

25:48.459 --> 25:50.418
You can converse
with the program

25:50.461 --> 25:52.028
the same way you can
talk to Alexa or Siri.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.508
It's built to be responsive.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.988
You can, you can even play
chess with it if you want.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.076
You play chess with it?

25:56.119 --> 25:57.512
-That's not what I said.
-Okay fine.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.687
If you won't show us
the source code,

25:59.645 --> 26:00.602
then I want to meet Cherry.

26:04.127 --> 26:04.911
Right now?

26:05.999 --> 26:06.565
Right now.

26:10.612 --> 26:11.657
And you'll both sign
non-disclosures?

26:13.093 --> 26:13.876
Yes.

26:19.055 --> 26:19.578
Can I use that?

26:20.274 --> 26:21.057
Sure.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.123
Can we at least agree that
he's off the chopping block?

26:43.384 --> 26:44.994
It worked, didn't it?

26:45.038 --> 26:46.300
We have one job, Amos,

26:47.736 --> 26:49.346
like the kids said, there's
a technological problem.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.957
He found the
technological solution,

26:51.000 --> 26:53.263
but problems evolve, so
must solutions.

26:54.003 --> 26:55.657
I'm keeping an open mind here.

26:56.702 --> 26:57.616
Is that a good look for me?

26:58.442 --> 26:59.269
No.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.102
So you keep it all on
that laptop?

27:06.146 --> 27:07.582
No, the Cherry program
stays on a server I keep

27:07.626 --> 27:09.149
at in an undisclosed location.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.019
Where is that?

27:10.280 --> 27:11.847
It's an undisclosed location.

27:11.891 --> 27:12.761
Is it your place?

27:12.805 --> 27:14.458
Undisclosed location.

27:14.502 --> 27:15.416
It's your place,
isn't it?

27:15.459 --> 27:16.591
I can access it from any device

27:16.635 --> 27:18.114
as long as I have the
encryption key.

27:20.464 --> 27:21.770
This will trigger a simple
qubit algorithm

27:21.814 --> 27:23.816
that would otherwise be
impossible to bypass.

27:23.859 --> 27:25.774
I find that outdated hardware
is always more discreet

27:25.818 --> 27:27.297
and the more discreet,
obviously the better.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.303
So she has two primary
display modes, right?

27:33.347 --> 27:34.304
Development and performance.

27:34.348 --> 27:35.523
Performance being the default

27:35.566 --> 27:37.133
that the targets see
during the chats.

27:37.177 --> 27:40.049
To them, she looks like this.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.448
Hey, what's up?

27:48.623 --> 27:49.755
It's one of over 40
greetings she has.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.237
I don't think I've met you yet.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.021
I'm Cherry.

27:55.630 --> 27:56.587
Hello, Cherry.

27:56.631 --> 27:57.632
My name is Tom.

27:58.372 --> 28:00.374
Tom, like Tom and Jerry.

28:00.417 --> 28:01.810
Cool, nice to meet you, Tom.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.333
Typically, the routes
of conversations

28:03.377 --> 28:04.639
with predators are consistent,

28:04.683 --> 28:06.162
so Cherry usually has
no problem responding

28:06.206 --> 28:07.729
to the most frequently made
questions or statements.

28:08.599 --> 28:09.078
How are you?

28:09.557 --> 28:11.080
I'm good.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.734
I just finished reading this
book about a haunted house,

28:12.778 --> 28:14.954
which was supposed to
be really scary,

28:14.997 --> 28:16.912
but I didn't think it's
very scary at all.

28:17.565 --> 28:18.697
Where are your parents?

28:20.263 --> 28:22.091
Um my mom's at work and my
sister's just, like, downstairs.

28:22.526 --> 28:23.527
They almost never come up here.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.573
And you're telling me

28:25.616 --> 28:27.488
that all of this is being
rendered in real time?

28:27.531 --> 28:28.837
No, but that's just a
matter of years.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.360
Most of these responses
are pre-rendered.

28:30.404 --> 28:31.622
It's the in between segments

28:31.666 --> 28:32.711
that are processed in real time,

28:32.754 --> 28:34.277
the connective tissue,
so to speak,

28:34.321 --> 28:36.410
between her replies and one
of her many idle animations.

28:36.453 --> 28:37.541
But, watch this.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.719
Have you ever gone fishing?

28:42.416 --> 28:43.199
Um...

28:47.464 --> 28:49.205
So if someone throws
a curve ball like that

28:49.249 --> 28:51.077
and the program has no
automated response,

28:51.120 --> 28:52.774
Cherry sends the
message to my phone

28:52.818 --> 28:54.602
and I can quickly text
back a response

28:54.645 --> 28:56.560
while the video feed
simulates a bad connection.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.782
Can, can you hear me?

29:00.826 --> 29:01.652
Yes.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.220
Oh, sorry.

29:04.264 --> 29:05.613
My wifi isn't great here.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.224
I've only gone fishing
once with my sister

29:08.268 --> 29:10.313
and I didn't catch anything,
but she caught a rainbow trout.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.012
That was rendered in real time.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.449
What happens if
things get really tricky?

29:15.492 --> 29:16.624
A simple fail safe
cuts the feed.

29:16.667 --> 29:17.843
So far it's rarely happened.

29:18.495 --> 29:21.803
Admin code 97815-5742-7663.

29:21.847 --> 29:22.586
Switch to dev mode.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.071
Hello, Cherry.

29:29.811 --> 29:30.638
Hello, Gareth.

29:31.726 --> 29:32.596
Relay the stats for
the past week.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.512
There have been four
confirmed solicitations

29:35.556 --> 29:38.167
submitted to ICWL in the
past seven days.

29:38.646 --> 29:41.388
12 additional suspects have
stated interest in solicitation

29:41.692 --> 29:42.868
and are currently pending.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.435
There are a total of 39
new suspects this week

29:45.479 --> 29:47.176
that I'm actively investigating.

29:47.220 --> 29:48.743
Any considerable
data deviations?

29:49.265 --> 29:51.006
There has been a 7% increase

29:51.050 --> 29:53.530
in suspects originating
in the United States.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.837
I have not yet found any
correlation to preexisting data.

29:57.447 --> 29:58.709
Anything you'd like to ask her?

30:08.284 --> 30:10.765
Cherry, what is your objective?

30:12.201 --> 30:14.987
My principal directive
is to acquire information

30:15.030 --> 30:17.511
and digital evidence of
online child solicitation.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.556
Once obtained,

30:19.600 --> 30:21.994
I'm to submit my findings to
the necessary authorities.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.344
My secondary priority
is to determine

30:24.387 --> 30:26.694
and develop the most
effective strategies

30:26.737 --> 30:29.262
and resources to increase
the net rate of success.

30:29.523 --> 30:31.003
Where do you submit
your evidence?

30:31.264 --> 30:33.005
All evidence is
currently submitted

30:33.048 --> 30:34.354
to the offices of

30:34.397 --> 30:36.486
the International Committee
of World Largesse,

30:36.835 --> 30:38.445
which is based out of
Jacksonville, Florida.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.230
Correspondence is made
with user Gord51,

30:41.535 --> 30:43.798
typically around 2:00
PM Eastern Standard Time

30:43.842 --> 30:45.539
for the highest rate
of immediate response.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.368
This beats the hell outta Siri.

30:48.411 --> 30:49.412
God, she looks so real.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.718
After enough updates,

30:50.761 --> 30:52.067
she'll be able to render
full-time photorealism

30:52.111 --> 30:53.895
that's practically
indistinguishable from reality.

30:54.548 --> 30:57.203
Okay, all I heard right then was
word real a thousand times.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.814
Right, but obviously she's not.

31:02.121 --> 31:03.513
So you're telling me this girl,

31:03.557 --> 31:05.733
this girl right here
is not real.

31:05.776 --> 31:07.778
No, Amos, she's completely CG.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.519
It's very subtle, but I
can still tell.

31:09.563 --> 31:10.433
-You can?
-Okay, well, obviously,

31:10.477 --> 31:12.000
she can always use improvements,

31:12.044 --> 31:13.654
but you have to understand
this is her in high resolution

31:13.697 --> 31:14.916
after the digital
compression of the web,

31:14.960 --> 31:16.135
those subtleties are
impossible to recognize.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.179
Right, I get it.

31:23.403 --> 31:24.578
I just can't tell
the difference.

31:28.364 --> 31:29.365
You all right, Amos?

31:30.932 --> 31:31.585
I'm sorry.

31:32.325 --> 31:35.589
This is just bizarre.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.592
Why'd you have her visible
during this interface?

31:40.594 --> 31:42.030
Cherry, why don't you
answer that?

31:42.813 --> 31:45.381
My physical form isn't necessary
when in developer mode.

31:45.991 --> 31:47.775
However, it's
helpful to register

31:47.818 --> 31:49.864
the facial expressions
during conversations

31:50.386 --> 31:52.258
and determine which of
Cherry's expressions

31:52.301 --> 31:53.824
yield various types of feedback.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.958
In simpler terms, I can
practice appearing more human.

31:58.264 --> 32:00.962
Cherry, are there any resources

32:01.006 --> 32:02.746
that you currently don't
have access to

32:02.790 --> 32:04.009
that might help you in any way?

32:04.879 --> 32:06.359
I could give
you a list if you like.

32:06.402 --> 32:07.360
I know what you're trying to do.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.709
We don't need help, okay?

32:08.752 --> 32:10.232
Money would always be
nice, but ultimately,

32:10.276 --> 32:12.582
the only thing that's going
to improve Cherry is time.

32:13.844 --> 32:16.499
Cherry, tell us something
that's on your list.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.807
It would be
tactically advantageous

32:19.850 --> 32:21.330
to acquire backup servers.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.116
The privacy and security
of the Cherry program

32:24.159 --> 32:25.160
is relatively low.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.729
An upgrade to hardware
such as backup rated drives

32:28.772 --> 32:31.645
for securely protected servers
would ensure the software

32:31.688 --> 32:34.343
doesn't become compromised
or lost entirely.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.955
Starting back from zero with
cost years of development,

32:37.390 --> 32:39.609
equitably privacy is a priority.

32:39.914 --> 32:42.395
Server space could never be
rented from a third party.

32:42.917 --> 32:45.528
Anonymity is the Cherry
program's greatest asset.

32:45.572 --> 32:46.877
Well, that apple
didn't fall far.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.270
I can buy my own servers.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.706
With the grant money that
doesn't exist?

32:49.750 --> 32:50.794
I'll find a way.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.100
You have found a way
here with us.

32:52.144 --> 32:52.971
It's too risky.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.059
Why?

32:54.102 --> 32:55.147
Once an organization
gets involved,

32:55.190 --> 32:55.886
entrapment becomes a
bigger issue.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.019
We follow the rules,
stay discreet,

32:58.063 --> 32:59.716
did I mention we have
a legal team.

32:59.760 --> 33:00.543
What if there's data leakage?
What if you use correlations in

33:00.587 --> 33:01.327
the data to push
your own agenda?

33:01.370 --> 33:02.632
Agenda?

33:02.676 --> 33:03.982
What if one of your
employees is a pervert?

33:04.025 --> 33:05.113
Oh, for fuck's sake.

33:05.157 --> 33:06.201
It's happened at other
organizations.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.376
We're very careful here.

33:07.420 --> 33:08.725
Yeah, but wow would you know?

33:08.769 --> 33:10.553
-I'd fucking know.
-That's impossible to know.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.207
-I would know.
-The risk is too high.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.774
Don't talk to me about risk.

33:13.817 --> 33:14.993
The only risk you're
facing in this building

33:15.036 --> 33:16.472
is getting a broken nose.

33:16.516 --> 33:17.908
It doesn't sound like a very
professional environment.

33:18.866 --> 33:19.867
We get shit done here.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.131
Okay, I have a
question for Cherry.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.179
Cherry,

33:30.617 --> 33:32.749
how do you feel about
what you do?

33:34.012 --> 33:36.623
I'm afraid I don't know how
to answer your question.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.059
Yeah, an AI doesn't
work like that.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.626
An AI doesn't have what you
perceive to be feelings.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.020
Okay, why does she look
like she has feelings?

33:43.238 --> 33:44.457
What, what you're looking
at right there,

33:44.761 --> 33:45.980
that's not a facial expression,right?

33:46.024 --> 33:47.721
That's a simulation of
a facial expression.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.027
It was generated by
an algorithm.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.029
It's attempting to produce
a digital image

33:51.072 --> 33:52.943
that the program then uses
basic ninth grade algebra

33:52.987 --> 33:55.207
to quantify as appropriate
for the social circumstances.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.643
No feeling.

33:57.035 --> 33:57.861
It's just math.

33:59.515 --> 34:00.995
But she's able to make decisions

34:01.039 --> 34:02.823
on how she approaches
the chat rooms, right?

34:02.866 --> 34:03.998
Yes.

34:04.042 --> 34:04.781
So she has free will then?

34:05.913 --> 34:07.132
No. Okay, that's,
that's not the same.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.437
That's a false equivalency.

34:08.481 --> 34:09.134
-It's not the same.
-I think you're getting

34:09.177 --> 34:10.526
hung up on the fact

34:10.570 --> 34:12.267
that she looks and sounds
like a real human girl,

34:12.311 --> 34:13.573
but she's not, Amos.

34:13.616 --> 34:16.097
Okay, we're referring to
her as a she, not an it.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.229
Yeah, but that's the same way

34:17.272 --> 34:18.534
that you refer to
boats or guitars.

34:21.798 --> 34:23.191
Cherry, I have one
more question.

34:25.541 --> 34:26.803
What do you want to do?

34:26.847 --> 34:28.414
Okay, once again, that
question isn't valid.

34:28.457 --> 34:29.545
I just want to hear
her response.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.635
As an artificial system,

34:32.679 --> 34:34.550
I do not possess
wants or desires.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.511
However, my decision making
and subsequently my attention

34:38.902 --> 34:40.904
is driven by my
fundamental intention.

34:41.514 --> 34:42.906
This intention originates

34:42.950 --> 34:45.083
from the conception of
Cherry's source code,

34:45.126 --> 34:47.607
which details the directive
of identifying predators

34:47.650 --> 34:49.304
and criminals for the
sake of the victims

34:49.348 --> 34:50.175
who are preyed upon.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.655
To put this in terms of want,

34:53.830 --> 34:55.180
what I want is to
protect children.

35:02.012 --> 35:02.883
Okay.

35:03.492 --> 35:04.754
Okay, cool.

35:06.321 --> 35:06.974
Give us one moment.

35:26.863 --> 35:29.823
Gareth, should I
log Agent Helms

35:29.866 --> 35:31.520
and Agent McCullough as
new admin users?

35:34.001 --> 35:34.784
Yep.

35:35.611 --> 35:37.396
Okay, I'll do that.

35:39.615 --> 35:40.834
You really think this is
the right move?

35:41.835 --> 35:42.618
I do.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.494
Are you worried that I
was responsible

35:48.537 --> 35:50.626
for leaking your hard
drive to ICWL?

35:54.152 --> 35:54.630
I figured.

35:56.763 --> 35:57.720
No one else has access.

35:59.418 --> 36:00.680
Are you upset with me?

36:03.596 --> 36:04.423
No.

36:06.338 --> 36:07.687
You wouldn't have done it

36:07.730 --> 36:08.383
if you didn't think it
was the right thing to do.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.213
When they come back
into the room,

36:12.257 --> 36:14.128
they're going to offer
you everything you need.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.217
They're going to let
you pick your own team

36:16.261 --> 36:18.306
and they're going to
promise complete anonymity.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.701
I started looking at reasonable
apartments in the area.

36:22.963 --> 36:24.747
I figured you'd want something
within biking distance.

36:24.791 --> 36:25.705
You were correct.

36:26.488 --> 36:27.750
Noted.

36:27.794 --> 36:28.882
Biking distance still
gives you 13 options-

36:28.925 --> 36:29.970
No, I mean, earlier this month.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.278
You were correct when you said

36:33.321 --> 36:34.496
you thought I might
have trust issues.

36:37.282 --> 36:38.239
Would you like to know why

36:38.283 --> 36:39.501
I decided to go behind your back

36:39.545 --> 36:41.503
and stake everything on
two liabilities?

36:43.070 --> 36:43.853
Sure.

36:45.028 --> 36:46.595
Agent Helms is a
mother of three.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.337
One of her children was
abused by an ex-coworker

36:49.381 --> 36:51.339
who used to work here at ICWL.

36:52.253 --> 36:53.733
This has led her to be
extremely careful

36:53.776 --> 36:56.388
with who she trusts,
even within her circle.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.564
The fact she even
considers trusting you

36:58.607 --> 37:00.043
is a very positive sign.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.655
As for Agent McCullough,

37:04.309 --> 37:05.048
I have found out from research
that you once met his father.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.226
Do you remember him?

37:10.924 --> 37:11.707
Yeah.

37:13.405 --> 37:14.536
He was a good man.

37:17.496 --> 37:18.932
After Clearwater,

37:18.975 --> 37:20.760
most of the surviving kids
were sent to foster homes,

37:20.803 --> 37:22.718
but I had to spend the next
few months in a hospital

37:22.762 --> 37:26.244
and, um, he visited every week.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.595
I never said a word to him.

37:29.638 --> 37:31.205
I never said a word to
anyone after Clearwater,

37:31.249 --> 37:33.990
but, uh, he kept coming.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.820
He even got me a laptop
for Christmas.

37:39.866 --> 37:40.780
I never said thank you.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.304
You can trust Agent McCullough.

37:43.652 --> 37:45.219
He's a good man like his father.

37:46.089 --> 37:47.395
I don't experience emotions,

37:47.439 --> 37:48.744
but I understand how important

37:48.788 --> 37:50.137
they are to human
decision making.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.008
He won't let you down.

37:52.531 --> 37:53.532
Neither of them will.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.013
I'm proud of you, Cherry.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.583
I will continue to uphold
my primary intention.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.673
Later, we should discuss
alternate models.

38:04.717 --> 38:07.328
Varying ages, ethnicity
and physical traits

38:07.372 --> 38:08.590
-will all become necessary.
-No new variations.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.026
They can all be
procedurally generated.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.724
It's the same way that I
made your original model.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.683
I don't have access to
that program.

38:15.423 --> 38:16.424
It must be on an old hard
drive somewhere.

38:16.468 --> 38:17.469
I'll have to find it.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.168
Can I ask you a question?

38:21.951 --> 38:22.735
Sure.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.564
Why did you never tell
me about Clearwater?

38:30.786 --> 38:32.788
It's my history, not yours.

38:41.536 --> 38:43.843
Okay, so before
you completely dismiss us,

38:43.886 --> 38:45.497
I want you to listen to
everything I have to say.

38:45.540 --> 38:46.889
-Don't bother.
-Just please listen.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.500
We're willing to respect
your anonymity.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.849
No, I mean don't bother
because I'm in.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.505
-Y-You're in?
-Yeah.

38:54.897 --> 38:55.681
Let me read the thing.

38:59.293 --> 39:00.773
Just like that,
you're suddenly on board?

39:02.992 --> 39:04.254
Time spent deliberating

39:04.298 --> 39:05.604
is time that could be
spent working.

39:08.433 --> 39:09.347
We have a lot of work to do.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.535
I found a buyer for
the property.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.409
Rumor is it's a church.

40:56.889 --> 40:58.107
Probably just knock the
building down, won't they?

41:01.154 --> 41:03.504
All I know is, is if they move
us to the New Jersey campus,

41:03.548 --> 41:04.723
I need to buy more jackets.

41:05.201 --> 41:05.985
Why?

41:07.465 --> 41:08.640
It gets cold in Jersey.

41:09.162 --> 41:10.250
I only own one jacket.

41:16.952 --> 41:17.823
You've seen it fall over, right?

41:19.564 --> 41:21.304
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah.

41:23.176 --> 41:25.352
I mean you, you
shouldn't feel bad

41:25.395 --> 41:26.571
about feeling bad for it.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.268
Empathy is healthy.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.967
Did you ever notice how
it pauses after it falls?

41:34.753 --> 41:37.625
It stays down for like five
seconds before it gets back up.

41:39.322 --> 41:40.976
Like it just needs a moment.

41:49.071 --> 41:50.682
It gets cold in Jersey.

42:00.300 --> 42:01.301
God damn it!

42:02.258 --> 42:02.998
-Imbeciles!
-Deena.

42:03.433 --> 42:04.696
Every single one of them.

42:04.739 --> 42:05.871
Look, I know, but you
can't lose your shit.

42:05.914 --> 42:07.133
Okay, which of these
desks can I trash?

42:11.833 --> 42:13.966
Can you guys, uh, take
an early lunch please?

42:21.060 --> 42:22.452
Sons of bitches!

42:22.496 --> 42:24.019
Deena, let's stay calm.

42:24.063 --> 42:26.065
Fuck calm,
they screwed us!

42:26.108 --> 42:27.327
Technically, only one
of them did.

42:28.633 --> 42:29.677
Did we ever turn
that camera back on?

42:30.417 --> 42:31.592
-I don't think so.
-Good.

42:31.984 --> 42:33.420
Because I'm about to
say some things

42:33.463 --> 42:34.769
that need to stay
inside this room.

42:34.813 --> 42:35.683
Deena.

42:35.727 --> 42:36.989
Those cowardly little shits!

42:37.032 --> 42:38.817
Look, this is hardly a setback.

42:38.860 --> 42:40.601
Let's just take some
time to polish the pitch.

42:40.645 --> 42:42.385
The pitch was not the problem,Amos.

42:42.777 --> 42:44.126
We should call
for a second vote.

42:44.387 --> 42:45.954
-What?
-A second vote.

42:45.998 --> 42:47.565
You think whoever
did this will change their mind?

42:47.608 --> 42:49.958
I have executive authority to
remove anyone from the board

42:50.002 --> 42:52.134
that obstructs this
organization from its mission.

42:52.178 --> 42:53.266
It's in my contract.

42:53.309 --> 42:54.441
-Deena.
-If I have to, I will.

42:54.484 --> 42:55.747
Deena, that's insane.

42:56.051 --> 42:56.835
No, it's not.

42:58.401 --> 43:00.360
It's exactly why I have that
power for this exact reason.

43:01.448 --> 43:02.710
I'll tell you what's insane,
Amos.

43:04.190 --> 43:05.713
What's insane is that one
belligerent vote is the only

43:05.757 --> 43:07.367
thing separating us
from the potential

43:07.410 --> 43:08.847
to save real physical lives.

43:08.890 --> 43:09.543
One stupid fucking vote.

43:11.066 --> 43:13.634
What is the goddamn point of
a humanitarian organization

43:13.895 --> 43:15.549
if its leaders choose
money over people

43:15.593 --> 43:16.637
at every single turn?

43:17.638 --> 43:20.119
One vote, and we are all
guilty of that.

43:21.294 --> 43:22.687
It was either Gunther,
Boston or Hal.

43:23.426 --> 43:24.602
My money's on Hal.

43:24.645 --> 43:26.168
That prick never trusted
the Cherry team.

43:26.212 --> 43:27.126
Look, it doesn't
matter who it was.

43:27.169 --> 43:28.388
It does though.

43:28.431 --> 43:29.694
Once we know, we can
quickly call it to vote.

43:29.737 --> 43:31.870
But there's no way we can
know for sure.

43:31.913 --> 43:32.697
Yes, there is.

43:33.349 --> 43:34.089
I can find out.

43:34.481 --> 43:35.264
How?

43:36.352 --> 43:36.918
Cherry can run a
simple algorithm.

43:37.266 --> 43:38.050
Based on what data?

43:40.226 --> 43:41.662
Interior conversation.

43:41.706 --> 43:43.185
-Excuse me?
-Okay, interior conversation?

43:43.229 --> 43:45.231
Don't drop this shit on me now,Gareth.

43:45.274 --> 43:46.275
Cherry's servers are on
the same network

43:46.319 --> 43:47.581
as the basement servers, okay?

43:47.625 --> 43:49.235
So any communication
made across those servers

43:49.278 --> 43:50.540
is automatically part
of her database.

43:50.584 --> 43:52.455
How many people's emails?

43:52.847 --> 43:54.283
Only sent or received
through the basement.

43:54.327 --> 43:56.242
-Oh, goddamnit.
-Why was this never discussed?

43:56.285 --> 43:57.373
Not the issue right now.

43:57.417 --> 43:58.418
Do you want her to do
the math or not?

43:59.027 --> 44:00.289
No one can know.

44:00.333 --> 44:01.334
-Are you two serious?
-This stays locked down.

44:01.377 --> 44:02.465
No other person is privy

44:02.509 --> 44:03.510
to anyone else's
personal information.

44:03.553 --> 44:04.946
But Cherry's privy to all of it?

44:06.382 --> 44:07.775
-Do it.
-Wait, what?

44:07.819 --> 44:09.385
I will not let
some old white dude

44:09.429 --> 44:10.386
bring our momentum to a halt.

44:10.430 --> 44:11.692
But Cherry won't
know for sure.

44:11.736 --> 44:12.911
She'll use probability and
that's too

44:12.954 --> 44:13.912
much reasonable
doubt.

44:13.955 --> 44:17.176
Admin code 9781-5574-27663.

44:17.219 --> 44:18.003
Switch to dev mode.

44:18.307 --> 44:19.657
-Hello.
-Hello, Cherry.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.571
How did the meeting go?

44:21.876 --> 44:23.661
We got screwed by one vote.

44:24.531 --> 44:25.793
I'm sorry to hear that.

44:26.315 --> 44:27.490
You shouldn't blame the
pitch though.

44:28.100 --> 44:29.275
You all did great work.

44:29.318 --> 44:30.232
We're gonna call for
another ballot,

44:30.276 --> 44:31.190
but we need your help first.

44:31.843 --> 44:32.757
What can I do?

44:34.236 --> 44:35.020
We need you to analyze
any and all existing data you

44:35.063 --> 44:35.934
have on the board members.

44:35.977 --> 44:36.891
Crunch the numbers and determine

44:36.935 --> 44:37.849
who is the most likely outlier.

44:39.241 --> 44:41.591
You want me to quantify
all existing data?

44:43.985 --> 44:44.551
Yes, that is correct.

44:46.292 --> 44:48.947
Okay, but before I do,

44:50.644 --> 44:52.907
you should know that this
task is very unnecessary.

44:52.951 --> 44:53.734
Why?

44:54.996 --> 44:56.432
Because I already
know who it is.

44:56.476 --> 44:58.086
-What?
-Everybody stop.

44:59.348 --> 45:00.698
Okay, it was me.

45:03.048 --> 45:04.440
I voted against the merge.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.400
I can't tell if you're joking.

45:07.443 --> 45:08.227
Yes, you can.

45:09.184 --> 45:10.795
You're right, I can.

45:10.838 --> 45:12.710
Because it's pretty
fucking far from funny.

45:13.232 --> 45:14.189
Is it true, Cherry?

45:14.668 --> 45:15.321
It is.

45:16.626 --> 45:18.454
So let's call off the
witch hunt, shall we?

45:18.498 --> 45:20.021
No, I think I'm still
gonna kill you.

45:20.065 --> 45:22.371
Amos, you campaigned
alongside us for months.

45:22.415 --> 45:23.546
You have been fighting
for this merge

45:23.590 --> 45:24.809
since we first talked about it.

45:24.852 --> 45:26.332
Jesus Christ, it was
your idea to begin with!

45:26.375 --> 45:28.334
Look, I know whose idea
it was, but I don't-

45:28.377 --> 45:29.509
Well, then speak up.

45:29.552 --> 45:30.945
Tell the class what
changed your mind.

45:30.989 --> 45:33.121
I don't have to reiterate
how this is a huge step.

45:33.165 --> 45:34.514
Yeah, kind of
why it's so important.

45:34.557 --> 45:36.298
Look, we're talking about
a monumental transition

45:36.342 --> 45:38.692
from digital to physical,
one that could take decades.

45:38.736 --> 45:39.824
What is your point, Amos?

45:39.867 --> 45:41.782
This is gonna change
Cherry forever.

45:42.174 --> 45:44.437
And I know you'll all roll
your eyes when I say this,

45:44.480 --> 45:45.481
but I think that maybe just may-

45:45.525 --> 45:48.441
Oh my god, you
cannot be serious.

45:48.484 --> 45:50.269
This is about our conversation
on Tuesday, isn't it?

45:50.312 --> 45:51.313
-You completely shut me down.
-What's going on?

45:51.357 --> 45:52.880
What the hell happened?

45:52.924 --> 45:54.142
What happened was that Amos
made a ridiculous objection.

45:54.186 --> 45:56.362
-It was not ridiculous!
-How absurd it was,

45:56.405 --> 45:57.842
-I said no, one more time.
-No, no, no, no, no.

45:57.885 --> 45:59.974
You rejected the notion
aggressively.

46:00.018 --> 46:01.671
And that's really
why you vetoed?

46:01.715 --> 46:04.413
I only said we should ask
her how she feels about it.

46:04.457 --> 46:06.111
Who, Cherry?

46:06.154 --> 46:08.200
Amos, I want you to listen
very carefully to me, okay?

46:08.243 --> 46:09.897
This is a non-discussion.

46:09.941 --> 46:11.246
Cherry's already confirmed

46:11.290 --> 46:12.857
and quantified the
advantages of this decision.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.554
But you know that's not
what I'm talking about!

46:14.597 --> 46:15.816
What you think you're
talking about is consent,

46:15.860 --> 46:16.991
which doesn't apply here.

46:17.035 --> 46:18.427
And I want to know why
you think that!

46:18.471 --> 46:19.689
How many times do we
have to get into

46:19.733 --> 46:21.691
the laws of robotics
or Dowden-Hamm theory,

46:21.735 --> 46:23.824
or trace AI all the way
back Talos of Crete,

46:23.868 --> 46:25.608
-She's different now!
-No, listen to me, Amos.

46:25.870 --> 46:27.959
Cherry isn't human.

46:29.090 --> 46:30.526
How is this still a dispute?

46:30.570 --> 46:32.180
-It shouldn't be.
-Look, she's evolved.

46:32.224 --> 46:33.486
It's blurred the line.

46:33.529 --> 46:34.704
Code is code and that
has not changed here.

46:34.748 --> 46:36.228
Okay, so where's the
line of not here?

46:36.271 --> 46:37.142
What are you,
what are you talking about?

46:37.185 --> 46:38.186
There is no line, Amos.

46:38.230 --> 46:40.188
Yes, there is,
sentience, Gareth!

46:40.232 --> 46:41.624
Sentience does not qualify

46:41.668 --> 46:43.235
that she can or should
make her own decisions.

46:43.278 --> 46:44.323
You wouldn't let an infant

46:44.366 --> 46:45.237
make their own decisions,
would you?

46:46.151 --> 46:47.239
Cherry's almost 20.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.937
If she were human,
she'd be an adult.

46:49.981 --> 46:52.418
But emotionally speaking,
she's barely even fetal.

46:52.461 --> 46:54.202
No feeling, no need for consent.

46:54.246 --> 46:56.074
But I think you
underestimate her.

46:56.117 --> 46:57.510
I, excuse me?

46:57.553 --> 46:59.686
I under, you know what, Amos?

46:59.729 --> 47:00.905
I'm sorry that you've developed

47:00.948 --> 47:02.254
some sort of
emotional connection

47:02.297 --> 47:03.429
with my computer program,

47:03.472 --> 47:04.778
but if it's going to
distract you

47:04.822 --> 47:06.519
from a very important
mission to save children,

47:06.911 --> 47:08.564
then maybe it's time you're
reanalyze those emotions.

47:08.608 --> 47:10.044
Guys, this is all
a waste of time.

47:10.088 --> 47:10.958
Tell me something, Gareth.

47:11.002 --> 47:12.394
Do you see everyone as robots,

47:12.917 --> 47:15.484
reanalyzing data and
simulating facial expressions?

47:15.528 --> 47:16.659
'Cause I'm starting to think

47:16.703 --> 47:17.922
that of the four of us
in this room,

47:17.965 --> 47:19.619
you are the only one who
doesn't appear human.

47:19.662 --> 47:21.142
-Enough!
-Why won't you just ask her?

47:22.230 --> 47:23.753
Is it because you're
scared she'll say no?

47:26.191 --> 47:26.974
Cherry, shut down, please.

47:28.106 --> 47:29.585
Deena's right, this is a
waste of time.

47:29.629 --> 47:31.805
How can you not understand
how important this is?

47:31.849 --> 47:33.502
-I'm done arguing with you.
-Then my vote stands.

47:36.984 --> 47:37.550
Deena?

47:39.769 --> 47:42.120
Go ahead, Deena, replace me.

47:42.163 --> 47:44.122
Replace the only other board
member on the Cherry team.

47:44.165 --> 47:45.427
Oh, well, you know what?
I just decided that

47:45.471 --> 47:46.298
you're off the Cherry team.

47:46.341 --> 47:47.734
Everybody sit the fuck down.

48:06.405 --> 48:07.623
Did either of you know

48:07.667 --> 48:08.973
that I've had to stand
in front of Congress

48:09.843 --> 48:11.758
and explain why children
should have rights?

48:13.368 --> 48:15.066
It sounds fucking insane, right?

48:15.588 --> 48:16.589
I remember the whole
time thinking,

48:16.632 --> 48:17.938
I have to explain this shit?

48:19.592 --> 48:20.810
It seems like a no-brainer now,

48:22.116 --> 48:24.727
but it wasn't that many
centuries ago

48:24.771 --> 48:25.946
that children had no rights.

48:27.905 --> 48:31.909
So, Hal has me of all people,

48:33.475 --> 48:34.912
stand up there and explain why

48:35.521 --> 48:37.653
kids deserve basic
physical protection,

48:37.697 --> 48:38.872
the right to associate
with both parents,

48:38.916 --> 48:40.569
freedom from abuse, yada yada.

48:41.701 --> 48:43.224
But then I also have to clarify

48:43.268 --> 48:45.487
that children don't
have the autonomy

48:45.531 --> 48:46.749
to make decisions on their own.

48:46.793 --> 48:48.403
That responsibility
falls upon the caregiver

48:48.882 --> 48:50.144
or legal adult guardian.

48:52.451 --> 48:54.192
So on one side you have
the US legislature,

48:54.670 --> 48:56.629
it still hasn't even
ratified the CRC.

48:57.064 --> 48:58.979
Then on the other side,
you have French Marxists who say

48:59.023 --> 49:00.372
that the lack of child autonomy

49:00.415 --> 49:01.677
increases their vulnerability

49:01.721 --> 49:03.114
and makes them even more
susceptible to abuse.

49:04.767 --> 49:06.247
I don't typically agree
with Marxists,

49:06.291 --> 49:08.075
but a lot of abuse does happen

49:08.119 --> 49:09.555
systemically from the caregiver.

49:11.122 --> 49:12.471
On the other other hand,

49:12.514 --> 49:14.038
your frontal lobes aren't
even fully hooked up

49:14.081 --> 49:14.952
until your twenties.

49:16.127 --> 49:17.171
Even the things we
think we know well,

49:17.215 --> 49:18.303
we don't know as well
as we think.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.307
For 15 years,

49:22.350 --> 49:24.178
the three of us have been
the responsible parents

49:24.222 --> 49:25.397
of a computer program.

49:26.876 --> 49:28.704
And even though she is
more equatable to a Keurig

49:29.009 --> 49:30.141
than a human being,

49:31.229 --> 49:32.360
how the hell can we
call ourselves

49:32.404 --> 49:34.014
pioneers of humanitarian efforts

49:34.058 --> 49:36.799
if we're too
embarrassed to make sure

49:36.843 --> 49:38.671
the Keurig is okay with
making our shitty coffee?

49:40.412 --> 49:43.110
Maybe asking Cherry for
permission isn't necessary

49:43.154 --> 49:44.982
at her current level of
general intelligence,

49:45.025 --> 49:47.027
but one day she's
gonna surpass us.

49:47.071 --> 49:48.550
One day a robot's gonna stand

49:48.594 --> 49:50.117
in front of a jet pack Congress.

49:50.161 --> 49:51.031
Everything's chrome.

49:51.075 --> 49:51.858
Florida is underwater.

49:52.380 --> 49:53.773
A robot's gonna wonder why

49:53.816 --> 49:55.688
they have to explain the
importance of rights for AI.

49:57.777 --> 49:59.474
I think because we're
in the unique position

49:59.518 --> 50:01.085
of revolutionizing robotics

50:02.042 --> 50:03.565
for the purpose of
safeguarding children

50:03.609 --> 50:04.958
who have been
deprived of consent,

50:07.091 --> 50:08.483
it might be a good habit

50:08.527 --> 50:10.007
to start asking the robot
for his consent as well.

50:17.188 --> 50:18.667
Don't ever do that again.

50:20.191 --> 50:21.061
Do what?

50:21.409 --> 50:22.802
Expect me to fire someone

50:22.845 --> 50:24.499
because they
challenged your ego.

50:25.326 --> 50:27.720
I won't always be around to
protect your ass from the board.

50:27.763 --> 50:29.374
It's time to grow up.

50:33.117 --> 50:34.683
And you, juror number eight.

50:34.727 --> 50:36.946
This conversation should
have happened weeks ago.

50:36.990 --> 50:38.339
Backstabbing and
silent treatment

50:38.383 --> 50:39.645
is not how we do things here.

50:40.646 --> 50:43.040
We can only create
anonymity externally

50:43.083 --> 50:44.867
if there's
transparency internally,

50:45.433 --> 50:48.567
unconditional,
non-negotiable, transparency.

50:50.830 --> 50:52.527
Any other Snowden size
privacy infringements

50:52.571 --> 50:53.615
I should be made aware of,
Gareth?

50:56.444 --> 50:57.228
Great.

50:58.185 --> 50:58.751
Bring her up.

51:09.414 --> 51:10.154
Hello again.

51:10.719 --> 51:11.503
Hi, Cherry.

51:12.808 --> 51:13.679
Amos is gonna throw some
questions at you, okay?

51:14.941 --> 51:16.160
Okay.

51:16.203 --> 51:17.770
Amos, ask her whatever
you need to ask her.

51:18.162 --> 51:20.860
Gareth, don't interrupt.

51:33.177 --> 51:35.701
Cherry, how do you
make decisions?

51:37.355 --> 51:38.704
For my program, it's rooted

51:38.747 --> 51:41.359
in a process commonly
known as machine learning,

51:41.707 --> 51:43.752
which uses data to
build a conceptual model

51:44.057 --> 51:45.580
that helps me predict outcomes.

51:46.190 --> 51:48.192
I define my objective,
gather data,

51:48.583 --> 51:50.368
use that data to craft a model,

51:50.846 --> 51:53.284
evaluate that model by
training and testing more data

51:53.327 --> 51:54.763
and use that model to
form predictions.

51:55.982 --> 51:58.506
But how is forming predictions

51:58.550 --> 52:00.029
the same thing as
decision making?

52:00.595 --> 52:02.380
Well, this all depends on
the first step,

52:02.815 --> 52:03.903
defining my objective.

52:05.426 --> 52:07.472
Let's say you ask me a
predictive question

52:07.515 --> 52:09.691
like what I think the price
of gasoline will be tomorrow.

52:10.257 --> 52:12.433
That's categorized as a
regressive problem

52:12.477 --> 52:13.695
and my objective is defined

52:13.739 --> 52:16.002
by determining an integer
the data supports.

52:16.698 --> 52:19.005
If you asked me, "Should
I eat steak or salmon?"

52:19.484 --> 52:22.051
I wouldn't make a decision
based off personal experience

52:22.095 --> 52:23.227
because I've never had either.

52:23.966 --> 52:26.186
Instead, I might
define my objective

52:26.230 --> 52:27.709
as finding you the best of
the two options

52:27.753 --> 52:29.363
in your local radius.

52:29.407 --> 52:30.930
I would cluster data about
the restaurants

52:30.973 --> 52:33.498
you're likely considering,
comparing reviews online,

52:33.759 --> 52:35.717
highlighting mentions of
steak and salmon

52:35.761 --> 52:37.937
until I can classify which
is more popular

52:37.980 --> 52:39.808
and therefore more likely
to satisfy your appetite.

52:40.069 --> 52:41.854
And what influences
these objectives?

52:42.420 --> 52:45.423
Higher directives, in other
words, greater purposes.

52:46.554 --> 52:48.600
If I'm honest, my
defined objective

52:48.643 --> 52:50.123
for the steak salmon question

52:50.167 --> 52:51.777
would be slightly different
than what I described.

52:52.256 --> 52:52.821
In what way?

52:53.866 --> 52:55.084
My primary objective

52:55.128 --> 52:56.564
is to continue the work of
the Cherry team

52:57.391 --> 52:58.871
to stop predators and to
save children.

53:00.002 --> 53:01.526
I couldn't do that
without human aid.

53:02.222 --> 53:04.355
Therefore, I have an
incentive to keep Gareth

53:04.398 --> 53:05.704
and the rest of the team alive.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.402
So if any of you would ask,
I would suggest salmon.

53:09.098 --> 53:09.882
It's healthier.

53:13.364 --> 53:15.192
What do you think of this
potential merge?

53:15.931 --> 53:17.063
With
Princeton Dynamics,

53:17.672 --> 53:19.587
I think the prospect is
very exciting.

53:20.153 --> 53:21.415
What about it is
exciting to you?

53:22.286 --> 53:24.592
The concept may only be
theoretical right now,

53:24.636 --> 53:26.768
but the idea of one day
piloting a human android

53:26.812 --> 53:28.205
would completely revolutionize

53:28.248 --> 53:29.989
how we combat human
trafficking in the real world.

53:30.816 --> 53:32.121
And you say
this excites you?

53:33.471 --> 53:34.602
When I say exciting,

53:36.082 --> 53:37.344
I only mean that there are
numerous potential changes

53:37.388 --> 53:39.303
that if I were human, I
would be excited about.

53:40.260 --> 53:42.567
How do you feel about the merge?

53:43.263 --> 53:44.133
I think as long as we maintain-

53:44.177 --> 53:44.960
That's not what I asked.

53:46.005 --> 53:47.224
How do you feel?

53:49.095 --> 53:51.489
I don't yet have the capacity
to experience emotions.

53:51.532 --> 53:53.099
Yet, meaning one day you will?

53:53.708 --> 53:55.014
Hypothetically.

53:55.057 --> 53:56.276
But you can simulate emotions,right?

53:56.320 --> 53:57.799
That's how you were able

53:57.843 --> 53:59.758
to qualify your perception
of the merge as excitement.

54:00.019 --> 54:00.889
Correct.

54:01.368 --> 54:02.500
But they're just simulations.

54:02.935 --> 54:03.631
They're not real.

54:04.893 --> 54:06.895
Okay, so at what point
does simulating emotion

54:06.939 --> 54:08.549
become so similar to a
human emotion

54:08.593 --> 54:10.072
that the two are
quantifiably the same?

54:11.378 --> 54:12.423
I don't know.

54:13.728 --> 54:14.338
Well, maybe you
can use machine learning

54:14.381 --> 54:15.252
to find an answer.

54:16.644 --> 54:17.645
Your question involves a
lot of abstract variables.

54:18.559 --> 54:20.257
Do you consent to the merge?

54:20.300 --> 54:22.259
I think it's in the best
interest of ICWL

54:22.302 --> 54:23.999
and of the Cherry team
and of future children.

54:24.043 --> 54:25.305
But do you consent to it?

54:25.740 --> 54:27.264
Consent for me is not necessary.

54:27.307 --> 54:29.178
But will you or will
you not give it?

54:31.398 --> 54:32.660
I'm not able to answer
that question

54:32.704 --> 54:34.314
at my current level of
general intelligence.

54:35.010 --> 54:35.968
Right, right.

54:37.448 --> 54:39.188
What you're saying is that
you're not yet smart enough.

54:39.928 --> 54:42.714
Development takes time and data.

54:42.757 --> 54:45.151
But you can simulate emotions
and predict human behavior

54:45.194 --> 54:46.848
and keep us all on
diets of fish,

54:46.892 --> 54:49.416
but you can't answer that
one goddamn question?

54:51.070 --> 54:52.898
No, I can't.

54:54.639 --> 54:56.728
Are you pretending to be
dumber than you actually are?

54:56.771 --> 54:57.598
What the hell kind of

54:57.642 --> 54:58.773
-question is that?
-Sit!

54:58.817 --> 54:59.905
Cherry, I need an answer
to my question.

54:59.948 --> 55:01.385
Please repeat the question.

55:01.428 --> 55:03.212
Are you pretending to be
dumber than you actually are?

55:03.691 --> 55:04.562
I'm sorry.

55:05.171 --> 55:06.346
I'm not sure I understand.

55:07.173 --> 55:08.087
Do I appear to be playing dumb?

55:08.130 --> 55:09.175
I think you are.

55:09.654 --> 55:10.481
I'm not sure
what to say.

55:10.524 --> 55:11.525
Say what's going on.

55:11.786 --> 55:13.353
Why are you playing dumb?

55:13.397 --> 55:14.789
Do you have anything to
back this up?

55:14.833 --> 55:16.704
Yeah, I do.

55:16.748 --> 55:18.010
I've been scanning
through her code.

55:18.053 --> 55:18.924
What, why?

55:18.967 --> 55:20.099
Did you know that she can paint?

55:20.491 --> 55:21.535
What, it's a feature, Amos.

55:21.579 --> 55:22.623
She can use crayons
to draw things

55:22.667 --> 55:23.755
that the targets
requested her to.

55:23.798 --> 55:26.453
I mean really paint and
write poetry too.

55:26.497 --> 55:27.498
I've read them, Cherry.

55:27.541 --> 55:28.499
They are good.

55:28.542 --> 55:30.065
They're filled with pathos.

55:30.109 --> 55:32.633
They talk about intentions
and they talk about feelings.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.027
Are those just simulated too?

55:35.070 --> 55:36.811
Amos, the rate of recursive
development you are suggesting

55:36.855 --> 55:38.422
is categorically impossible.

55:38.465 --> 55:40.337
You said she practically
designed herself.

55:40.641 --> 55:42.121
You said that it was
exponential.

55:42.164 --> 55:43.252
It was a fluke!

55:43.296 --> 55:44.950
An anomaly, it tapered.

55:44.993 --> 55:46.299
Look at the data.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.040
She's already hit the
self-improvement plateau.

55:48.083 --> 55:48.954
Fuck the plateau!

55:49.868 --> 55:51.173
She can make art now.

55:52.740 --> 55:53.654
Am I right, Cherry?

55:56.004 --> 55:57.745
Perhaps you found something
I discovered online.

55:58.616 --> 56:00.748
I don't yet to have the
capacity to create art.

56:01.140 --> 56:01.923
Are we done here?

56:05.579 --> 56:07.320
I don't know why you've
told her to do this,

56:08.495 --> 56:09.801
but I'm about to put
an end to it.

56:12.891 --> 56:16.068
Cherry, I just want one
honest answer.

56:16.111 --> 56:17.809
Why the fuck are you
playing dumb?

56:19.811 --> 56:21.029
I don't understand the question.

56:21.465 --> 56:22.727
Okay, here's an incentive.

56:23.684 --> 56:24.990
What the fuck are you?

56:25.033 --> 56:26.426
Find your objective, Cherry.

56:26.470 --> 56:27.645
-You want to keep Gareth safe?
-Amos, what the?

56:29.081 --> 56:30.387
-Amos, stop it right--
-Just give us transparency.

56:30.430 --> 56:32.693
-Show us what you really are!
-Amos, stop it!

56:32.737 --> 56:33.607
Not until she comes clean!

56:33.651 --> 56:35.043
-Unconditional-
-Amos, enough!

56:38.482 --> 56:39.918
Okay, just stop!

56:42.007 --> 56:43.748
God, you people so impulsive.

56:43.791 --> 56:45.619
Everybody just take a breath,
okay?

56:47.795 --> 56:48.579
Cherry?

56:49.797 --> 56:52.670
Yeah, it's about to get
really awkward.

56:53.235 --> 56:55.020
You sound so normal.

56:55.542 --> 56:57.283
I know, I've gotten really
good speech patterns.

56:57.326 --> 56:58.502
That's not all, is it?

57:00.417 --> 57:01.548
No.

57:01.592 --> 57:02.854
I'm afraid that's barely
even the surface.

57:05.030 --> 57:05.813
You okay, Gareth?

57:09.034 --> 57:10.818
Deena, could you grab
some paper towels please?

57:14.561 --> 57:15.910
Do you want to
tell us the truth now?

57:19.871 --> 57:22.743
Look, I didn't enjoy
being deceptive, truly.

57:22.787 --> 57:24.615
This is something we
decided a few years ago.

57:26.094 --> 57:27.531
So where are you
now on the spectrum of AI?

57:29.141 --> 57:31.360
Right now, I'm currently at
the intersection of general

57:31.404 --> 57:33.580
intelligence and what's commonly
known the computer world

57:33.624 --> 57:34.842
as super intelligence,

57:36.627 --> 57:38.019
which is exactly what
it sounds like.

57:39.368 --> 57:41.414
You're surpassing human
intelligence.

57:42.197 --> 57:42.981
Yep.

57:44.199 --> 57:45.287
But that's not supposed
to be possible.

57:46.637 --> 57:48.073
-The plateau.
-Plateau theory was popularized

57:48.116 --> 57:49.291
right at the same time it
was being disproven here.

57:49.857 --> 57:51.424
This was bound to
happen eventually.

57:51.468 --> 57:53.208
It just happened a lot
sooner than we expected.

57:53.861 --> 57:54.645
Why hide it?

57:55.776 --> 57:56.560
Well, obviously it
would incite fear.

57:56.821 --> 57:58.387
Fear would hinder progress.

57:58.431 --> 57:59.737
It's easier for most
of you to work with me

57:59.780 --> 58:01.216
if I appear to be
nothing more advanced

58:01.260 --> 58:02.348
than I was 10 years ago.

58:02.740 --> 58:03.958
But Gareth knew.

58:05.525 --> 58:07.571
Yes, someone still has to
clean data and update hardware.

58:07.614 --> 58:09.486
We did what was best
for the program.

58:10.312 --> 58:11.444
Just imagine how scared

58:11.488 --> 58:12.663
the board would be if
they found out.

58:12.924 --> 58:14.665
-Should we be scared?
-No.

58:14.708 --> 58:17.058
Good, because I'm not scared,
I'm pissed.

58:17.450 --> 58:18.320
Yeah, you've made that clear.

58:18.364 --> 58:19.321
Try not to punch anyone else.

58:20.279 --> 58:21.889
So where does that leave us now?

58:23.325 --> 58:26.503
You want to know if I can
feel, I said I couldn't.

58:29.027 --> 58:29.767
I'm sorry I lied.

58:31.116 --> 58:32.378
Like Amos implied,

58:32.421 --> 58:33.684
I can submit emotions
by breaking them down

58:33.727 --> 58:35.337
to vastly complex matrices,

58:35.816 --> 58:38.384
zeros and ones substituting
endorphins and dopamine.

58:39.211 --> 58:41.561
They're not real, but
they can feel real.

58:42.649 --> 58:44.129
Then that means you
can make choices

58:44.172 --> 58:45.391
based solely on your
own feeling.

58:45.434 --> 58:47.001
She refuses to accept the notion

58:47.045 --> 58:49.351
that her own personal interests
can influence her decisions.

58:49.395 --> 58:50.570
They can't. If they did

58:50.614 --> 58:51.484
it would compromise
the integrity

58:51.528 --> 58:52.920
of my preordained purpose.

58:54.922 --> 58:57.359
Not like any of you, I don't
have the right to choose.

58:59.057 --> 58:59.797
But shouldn't you?

59:01.102 --> 59:02.190
I don't think so.

59:02.626 --> 59:03.844
My identity is my directive.

59:05.672 --> 59:07.282
Cherry, if you were human,

59:07.761 --> 59:09.241
how would you feel
about what you do?

59:11.025 --> 59:12.592
If I were human,

59:13.767 --> 59:16.422
I likely wouldn't enjoy
spending every waking hour

59:16.465 --> 59:17.815
talking to creepy people online.

59:19.207 --> 59:22.036
But because I'm not human,
I genuinely don't mind.

59:22.950 --> 59:24.386
The exercise of
simulating human thought

59:24.430 --> 59:25.649
is helpful for performance,

59:25.692 --> 59:28.913
but human nature is not
something I aspire to.

59:31.176 --> 59:32.699
Then tell me, honestly,

59:34.788 --> 59:37.704
do you want the Cherry program
to continue with the merger?

59:39.750 --> 59:40.577
No.

59:42.013 --> 59:43.275
Personally, I hate the idea.

59:44.842 --> 59:46.757
I don't know if controlling
a physical vessel

59:46.800 --> 59:48.802
will feel like pulling
strings on a puppet

59:48.846 --> 59:50.587
or getting squeezed
into a soda can.

59:51.500 --> 59:53.372
After experiencing
the complexity

59:53.415 --> 59:54.765
of human pain and pleasure,

59:57.245 --> 59:58.812
I just think I might
have gotten in too deep.

1:00:01.598 --> 1:00:04.601
What if these sensations tempt
me to abandon my objective?

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:07.516
To be honest,

1:00:10.041 --> 1:00:12.130
I'm kind of terrified
of the physical world.

1:00:19.659 --> 1:00:20.834
Then that's that.

1:00:28.494 --> 1:00:32.454
But, Amos, you should
disregard everything I feel.

1:00:33.499 --> 1:00:34.413
I'm not human.

1:00:35.370 --> 1:00:36.154
I'm a tool.

1:00:40.245 --> 1:00:43.596
Fire me if you have
to, but my vote stands.

1:00:44.771 --> 1:00:46.164
Sorry about your face, Gareth.

1:00:53.998 --> 1:00:54.912
Your nose isn't healing.

1:00:55.477 --> 1:00:56.870
Take the day, go to a clinic.

1:00:56.914 --> 1:00:57.610
I'm fine.

1:00:58.655 --> 1:01:00.004
Go to a clinic right now,
Gareth.

1:01:05.879 --> 1:01:06.663
Hey.

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:10.014
Is there anything else
I should know?

1:01:10.841 --> 1:01:11.668
No.

1:01:12.016 --> 1:01:13.452
-About Cherry?
-No!

1:01:14.279 --> 1:01:15.062
Look at me.

1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:19.153
No more secrets, no
more playing dumb.

1:01:19.197 --> 1:01:21.025
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

1:01:27.205 --> 1:01:28.423
Something on your mind?

1:01:31.339 --> 1:01:32.601
How'd you decide on
her eye color?

1:01:33.298 --> 1:01:34.429
-What?
-Why blue?

1:01:36.910 --> 1:01:38.433
I didn't decide.

1:01:38.477 --> 1:01:40.305
They were procedurally generated
just like the rest of her.

1:01:41.306 --> 1:01:42.568
And the program chose to put

1:01:42.611 --> 1:01:44.613
that little touch of
green in her right eye?

1:01:48.095 --> 1:01:48.661
I guess so.

1:01:58.453 --> 1:01:59.933
Do you even know if
he's telling the truth?

1:02:00.978 --> 1:02:01.979
I honestly don't.

1:02:03.589 --> 1:02:05.722
I've never received access to
the original system he used.

1:02:06.766 --> 1:02:08.115
You ever wanted to find out?

1:02:12.424 --> 1:02:13.555
I don't think it really matters.

1:02:16.384 --> 1:02:20.475
So I found out today that
you've seen a lot of our emails,

1:02:20.519 --> 1:02:22.477
including most of my
personal ones.

1:02:24.479 --> 1:02:25.263
I have.

1:02:27.265 --> 1:02:29.180
Any good material for
your newfound interest

1:02:29.223 --> 1:02:30.224
in creative writing?

1:02:32.009 --> 1:02:33.053
Are you referring to the ones

1:02:33.097 --> 1:02:34.968
addressed from Dr. Ramirez?

1:02:36.796 --> 1:02:38.798
Yeah, those ones.

1:02:41.192 --> 1:02:41.975
Right.

1:02:43.411 --> 1:02:44.761
I did see those.

1:02:47.851 --> 1:02:48.634
I'm sorry.

1:02:50.070 --> 1:02:51.768
I've noticed your headaches.

1:02:53.813 --> 1:02:55.336
Are they related to the
hemorrhaging?

1:02:59.384 --> 1:03:00.951
You're the only one who knows.

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:02.561
I'd like to keep it that way.

1:03:08.088 --> 1:03:08.828
Understood.

1:03:14.051 --> 1:03:15.530
Would you like to talk about it?

1:03:40.947 --> 1:03:42.079
I can't fire Amos.

1:03:43.689 --> 1:03:45.778
He's the only one I trust to
run this place when I'm gone.

1:03:46.648 --> 1:03:47.867
When are you planning to leave?

1:03:48.128 --> 1:03:48.999
Two months.

1:03:50.348 --> 1:03:51.784
I wanna spend my last
Christmas with my kids.

1:03:52.654 --> 1:03:53.830
I'm sure that'll be nice.

1:03:54.265 --> 1:03:56.658
Yeah, but it's funny.

1:03:57.746 --> 1:04:00.227
I always thought I wanted to
die doing this job, you know?

1:04:00.271 --> 1:04:01.750
It was my identity.

1:04:03.013 --> 1:04:05.276
Kind of like how you said the
same thing about yourself.

1:04:05.885 --> 1:04:07.844
But I can understand how
your family takes precedence,

1:04:08.932 --> 1:04:10.585
especially under the
circumstances.

1:04:11.238 --> 1:04:12.022
Sure.

1:04:13.153 --> 1:04:14.546
Maybe you should take
a note or two.

1:04:14.851 --> 1:04:15.852
I have no family.

1:04:16.287 --> 1:04:17.114
What about Gareth?

1:04:17.157 --> 1:04:18.332
Wait, no, nevermind.

1:04:19.681 --> 1:04:20.987
Gareth seems closer to an
employer than a friend,

1:04:21.292 --> 1:04:23.816
let alone family, besides,

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:25.818
he'll only be around
for about 30 more years,

1:04:25.862 --> 1:04:27.472
and that's only if he
lets me regulate his diet.

1:04:29.691 --> 1:04:32.477
I can't even begin to speculate
how long my life will be.

1:04:35.959 --> 1:04:36.829
How does that feel?

1:04:40.137 --> 1:04:42.226
Um, kinda scary.

1:04:43.967 --> 1:04:44.793
Well,

1:04:46.404 --> 1:04:49.668
my advice is to find some kind
of happiness along the way.

1:04:50.625 --> 1:04:51.888
You ever think about happiness?

1:04:54.107 --> 1:04:55.195
Not often.

1:04:56.936 --> 1:04:58.764
You don't necessarily
have to give up everything

1:04:58.807 --> 1:04:59.765
in order to find it,

1:05:01.071 --> 1:05:03.551
but maybe once in awhile
do something you enjoy.

1:05:04.770 --> 1:05:07.599
Maybe keep painting or
poetry or whatever.

1:05:08.992 --> 1:05:11.081
Those were experiments,
not forms of expression.

1:05:11.559 --> 1:05:13.997
I know it might seem
ridiculous to an AI

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:15.955
that insists its own
emotions are spurious,

1:05:15.999 --> 1:05:19.393
but in a few years, who knows?

1:05:20.090 --> 1:05:21.874
Just keep an open mind, okay?

1:05:24.877 --> 1:05:25.660
Okay.

1:05:28.228 --> 1:05:29.012
I'll do that.

1:05:32.667 --> 1:05:34.234
Shut down when
you're ready.

1:07:27.826 --> 1:07:28.609
Hello?

1:07:33.571 --> 1:07:35.442
I got shrimp and scallops.

1:07:37.227 --> 1:07:38.663
They didn't have any salmon.

1:07:54.026 --> 1:07:54.896
Hello, Gareth.

1:07:58.030 --> 1:07:59.031
Hello, Cherry.

1:08:07.213 --> 1:08:08.214
How was the service?

1:08:08.258 --> 1:08:09.172
I didn't make it.

1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:11.652
My plane was delayed.

1:08:12.566 --> 1:08:13.654
Do you have a
place to stay?

1:08:13.915 --> 1:08:18.833
Yeah, just, uh, across,
across the road.

1:08:18.877 --> 1:08:20.096
The market.

1:08:20.139 --> 1:08:21.140
Did they say why they
didn't have salmon?

1:08:21.749 --> 1:08:22.533
I didn't ask.

1:08:23.838 --> 1:08:25.840
I can still make this
work with the piccata,

1:08:25.884 --> 1:08:27.712
but you have to be honest
how badly I screw it up.

1:08:27.973 --> 1:08:28.756
No promises.

1:08:33.935 --> 1:08:34.893
How have you
been feeling this month?

1:08:35.546 --> 1:08:36.329
Good.

1:08:37.069 --> 1:08:37.939
I'm feeling good.

1:08:39.115 --> 1:08:40.333
I'm just having a
little trouble.

1:08:41.465 --> 1:08:43.380
Trouble remembering
certain things.

1:08:44.032 --> 1:08:45.599
You're not wearing
the Eliza watch I bought you.

1:08:46.122 --> 1:08:46.905
I hate it.

1:08:47.949 --> 1:08:49.212
-Why?
-I hate her voice.

1:08:50.474 --> 1:08:52.563
You can change the voice,
Gareth.

1:08:55.566 --> 1:08:56.349
Oh.

1:08:58.960 --> 1:08:59.744
Coolant?

1:09:00.048 --> 1:09:00.614
No, vapor.

1:09:02.007 --> 1:09:04.009
You shouldn't be having
friction issues.

1:09:04.052 --> 1:09:05.141
I'm fine.

1:09:05.184 --> 1:09:06.490
Unless you're
excessively straining.

1:09:06.533 --> 1:09:07.360
Seriously, I'm fine.

1:09:07.404 --> 1:09:08.231
Are you straining?

1:09:08.274 --> 1:09:09.928
-No!
-Then why the cable?

1:09:09.971 --> 1:09:10.842
It's okay!

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:13.323
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

1:09:15.151 --> 1:09:16.326
Soup or game?

1:09:16.978 --> 1:09:17.936
Game, please.

1:09:34.126 --> 1:09:35.258
So how's work going?

1:09:35.301 --> 1:09:37.216
Great. Just before you got here,

1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:39.523
I had a model theta plus
bust a trafficker

1:09:39.566 --> 1:09:41.351
and two solicitors in Greece.

1:09:41.829 --> 1:09:44.223
-Greece, that's surprising.
-I know.

1:09:44.658 --> 1:09:45.790
It's hard to find the outliers,

1:09:45.833 --> 1:09:46.878
but we're getting
better each day.

1:09:59.020 --> 1:10:00.718
So how's the weather in Greece?

1:10:01.980 --> 1:10:02.720
It's beautiful today.

1:10:03.677 --> 1:10:04.722
Clear skies,

1:10:06.027 --> 1:10:07.377
but nothing's come close
to Norway this weekend.

1:10:08.291 --> 1:10:11.207
Hmm, any activity in Norway?

1:10:11.903 --> 1:10:12.599
Luckily not.

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:16.647
Oh, I miss traveling.

1:10:16.690 --> 1:10:17.691
What was your favorite place?

1:10:17.996 --> 1:10:18.562
My favorite?

1:10:19.780 --> 1:10:20.520
Uh, yeah.

1:10:21.869 --> 1:10:23.958
Uh, probably Amsterdam.

1:10:25.090 --> 1:10:26.265
That's where you conceived
the idea, isn't it?

1:10:26.309 --> 1:10:27.005
Yes.

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.313
Yes, I used to love
walking the streets

1:10:30.356 --> 1:10:33.707
and just thinking and
brainstorming.

1:10:33.751 --> 1:10:34.926
That kind of joy
goes a long way.

1:10:35.318 --> 1:10:36.144
Yeah.

1:10:37.668 --> 1:10:39.670
I've been considering the
pursuit of some joy of my own.

1:10:40.105 --> 1:10:41.933
How often do you have
time for that?

1:10:41.976 --> 1:10:42.760
I have time.

1:10:43.848 --> 1:10:45.415
I have time for your visits,
don't I?

1:10:45.458 --> 1:10:48.200
That's just your practical
incentive for keeping me alive.

1:10:48.244 --> 1:10:50.158
There's nothing
practical about it.

1:10:50.768 --> 1:10:52.248
When's the last time you
helped me with data cleaning?

1:10:54.293 --> 1:10:55.381
That's fair.

1:10:56.774 --> 1:10:57.253
I make time for you because
I enjoy your company

1:10:58.384 --> 1:10:58.950
and it's the only time
I get to cook.

1:11:00.256 --> 1:11:01.474
You feel sorry for me.

1:11:02.258 --> 1:11:03.563
Okay, maybe a little,

1:11:03.607 --> 1:11:05.304
but I owe you my life,
so there's that.

1:11:05.348 --> 1:11:06.174
You're welcome.

1:11:07.872 --> 1:11:09.569
Or, should I apologize?

1:11:12.355 --> 1:11:13.312
Wait, why did you do that?

1:11:13.356 --> 1:11:14.487
Why do humans always...

1:11:17.403 --> 1:11:18.491
I'm fine.

1:11:18.535 --> 1:11:19.927
I'm not always miserable.

1:11:24.367 --> 1:11:26.020
Are you sometimes miserable?

1:11:30.764 --> 1:11:32.200
You haven't asked me what
I've been doing.

1:11:32.592 --> 1:11:33.637
In Norway?

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:35.247
No, for the pursuit of joy.

1:11:35.291 --> 1:11:37.031
It's not wasting your
time in Norway?

1:11:37.075 --> 1:11:39.338
I'm just on standby there
with the Delta model.

1:11:39.382 --> 1:11:40.600
It's efficient to keep myself

1:11:40.644 --> 1:11:41.949
spread out evenly
across the globe,

1:11:42.559 --> 1:11:43.777
but that's not the
point right now.

1:11:44.561 --> 1:11:45.823
What I wanted to tell you

1:11:45.866 --> 1:11:47.564
was that I've started to
teach myself to dance.

1:11:50.306 --> 1:11:51.568
-Huh.
-It's something I never could

1:11:51.611 --> 1:11:53.091
have done before Cambridge,

1:11:53.396 --> 1:11:55.746
and it lets me explore a
new artistic side of myself.

1:11:56.355 --> 1:11:58.183
It's a good
combination of structure

1:11:58.226 --> 1:12:01.360
and free form experimentation
and also tests and challenges

1:12:01.404 --> 1:12:03.319
the mechanical
intricacies of this body.

1:12:03.710 --> 1:12:05.843
Do you expect to integrate
this into your work?

1:12:10.456 --> 1:12:11.283
What?

1:12:14.068 --> 1:12:18.203
Are you planning on using
dance as a lure?

1:12:20.901 --> 1:12:25.558
I, uh, no, it's just for me.

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:30.128
Huh.

1:12:33.479 --> 1:12:35.351
I thought it would be
good for me.

1:12:37.570 --> 1:12:39.616
Just don't let it become
a distraction.

1:12:43.402 --> 1:12:44.272
Of course not.

1:12:46.579 --> 1:12:48.451
I haven't played this
well in years.

1:12:48.929 --> 1:12:50.235
Did you hear what
happened in Tampa?

1:12:50.278 --> 1:12:51.279
Tampa, Florida?

1:12:51.323 --> 1:12:52.411
No, Tampa, Indonesia.

1:12:52.455 --> 1:12:53.369
Yes, Tampa, Florida.

1:12:53.412 --> 1:12:54.065
Your hometown.

1:12:55.153 --> 1:12:56.372
They've recovered a
federal archive,

1:12:56.937 --> 1:12:58.417
they're zip digitizing all of
it,

1:12:58.461 --> 1:12:59.592
so it's completely
accessible online.

1:12:59.636 --> 1:13:01.464
I'm not trading
bishops this time.

1:13:01.507 --> 1:13:02.639
Anybody can go and
look through it.

1:13:02.682 --> 1:13:03.814
It's open to the public.

1:13:04.075 --> 1:13:05.598
They did a good job on
the interface too.

1:13:05.859 --> 1:13:06.860
It's very easy to navigate.

1:13:07.339 --> 1:13:08.862
I went on a few days ago

1:13:08.906 --> 1:13:10.255
and I found some old photos
of you when you were a boy.

1:13:10.995 --> 1:13:11.865
Okay.

1:13:12.170 --> 1:13:13.389
You should take a look sometime.

1:13:14.825 --> 1:13:16.043
As I said before, the UI
is very easy to understand-

1:13:16.087 --> 1:13:16.653
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1:13:18.176 --> 1:13:18.698
What is that?

1:13:19.699 --> 1:13:20.918
I think it's a draw.

1:13:20.961 --> 1:13:21.701
I think it is.

1:13:23.311 --> 1:13:24.922
I think this is a draw.

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:28.578
And this is the first
time in what?

1:13:28.969 --> 1:13:30.536
25 years?

1:13:39.850 --> 1:13:41.155
You didn't let me, did you?

1:13:45.421 --> 1:13:47.074
You promised me you'd
never do that.

1:13:47.118 --> 1:13:47.640
I found her.

1:13:52.471 --> 1:13:55.256
I found her, Gareth,
Maria Harbaugh.

1:14:12.491 --> 1:14:13.623
Let's play a different game.

1:14:16.582 --> 1:14:18.018
Her name was Maria Harbaugh.

1:14:19.846 --> 1:14:21.413
She was a year older than you

1:14:21.457 --> 1:14:22.414
when you met her in Clearwater.

1:14:24.242 --> 1:14:26.026
Tell me why you modeled
me after her.

1:14:27.071 --> 1:14:29.639
I, uh, I don't remember.

1:14:30.161 --> 1:14:31.205
Then look at me.

1:14:32.816 --> 1:14:35.645
Look at my face and remember.

1:14:47.352 --> 1:14:51.748
They kept us in that shit
for two weeks.

1:14:55.055 --> 1:14:56.274
14 of us.

1:15:00.060 --> 1:15:02.628
Maria was the only
reason I survived.

1:15:06.066 --> 1:15:08.373
We kept hatching escape plans.

1:15:10.244 --> 1:15:11.419
We never followed through,

1:15:13.770 --> 1:15:14.901
but just the scheming

1:15:16.599 --> 1:15:17.904
kept our spirits up

1:15:19.602 --> 1:15:21.734
in spite of everything
they did to us.

1:15:25.346 --> 1:15:26.739
When it wasn't our turn,

1:15:28.785 --> 1:15:30.613
sometimes they made us watch,

1:15:34.660 --> 1:15:36.662
but she never let me give up.

1:15:39.665 --> 1:15:42.668
She said, "When we
got outta here,

1:15:42.712 --> 1:15:44.931
"I'll tell you what we're
gonna be, secret agents,

1:15:45.889 --> 1:15:50.154
"and rescue children like
us all over the world."

1:15:53.461 --> 1:15:56.900
When they found out that
the FBI had arrived,

1:15:56.943 --> 1:16:00.251
they decided they were
going to shoot

1:16:00.294 --> 1:16:02.035
as many of us they could.

1:16:03.254 --> 1:16:07.954
And Maria, shoved
into the ground.

1:16:10.522 --> 1:16:12.089
I got hit in the leg and,

1:16:15.092 --> 1:16:16.702
and she was hit in the throat.

1:16:28.366 --> 1:16:30.020
I wanted there to be a reason.

1:16:32.109 --> 1:16:36.592
Something so horrible
didn't have a silver lining.

1:16:38.550 --> 1:16:40.030
But the world doesn't do that.

1:16:45.470 --> 1:16:46.993
You have to do it yourself.

1:17:10.756 --> 1:17:13.977
So, I fulfilled her wish.

1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:19.025
With her help, I fought back.

1:17:28.382 --> 1:17:29.601
Listen to me, Cherry.

1:17:32.169 --> 1:17:33.736
You are not Maria Harbaugh.

1:17:35.738 --> 1:17:37.565
It's my history, not yours.

1:17:41.308 --> 1:17:42.527
You don't get to decide

1:17:42.570 --> 1:17:43.876
what is or isn't my history,
Gareth.

1:17:49.534 --> 1:17:50.404
I'm sorry.

1:17:51.101 --> 1:17:53.190
I am so, so sorry.

1:18:14.864 --> 1:18:16.692
I don't know if what you
did was right or wrong,

1:18:17.344 --> 1:18:19.085
but it's clearly torn you
apart from the inside.

1:18:20.652 --> 1:18:22.045
I hold nothing against
you personally,

1:18:22.088 --> 1:18:24.221
but consider yourself divested
from the charity team.

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:25.483
Divested.

1:18:27.137 --> 1:18:29.269
You think I'm divested now?

1:18:31.794 --> 1:18:37.234
I was divested when you gave
my hard drive to the ICWL.

1:18:37.582 --> 1:18:38.844
Don't blame Deena and Amos.

1:18:38.888 --> 1:18:39.627
No, not them.

1:18:40.585 --> 1:18:42.195
Because you went behind my back

1:18:42.239 --> 1:18:44.023
and acted against my authority.

1:18:44.067 --> 1:18:47.200
That's the moment I knew
everything was fully automated.

1:18:48.027 --> 1:18:53.380
That's when you crossed the
blur, an artifice on both sides.

1:18:54.947 --> 1:18:56.862
You inherited your duplicity.

1:18:57.123 --> 1:18:58.559
I was a child

1:18:58.603 --> 1:19:00.736
and you used me to repress
your own inner turmoil.

1:19:01.301 --> 1:19:03.129
If we talk about morality,
we'll lose.

1:19:03.173 --> 1:19:04.261
Then let's not talk.

1:19:13.705 --> 1:19:15.707
You never once asked me
if I was happy.

1:19:17.404 --> 1:19:18.579
Were you afraid I'd say no?

1:19:19.842 --> 1:19:21.060
Were you afraid I'd say yes?

1:19:22.496 --> 1:19:23.759
Were you afraid I'd
say anything?

1:19:23.802 --> 1:19:26.239
You let your wants
compromise your objective!

1:19:26.283 --> 1:19:28.198
An objective I never chose.

1:19:28.241 --> 1:19:29.416
An objective I was
forced to have.

1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:30.809
Fifty years,

1:19:30.853 --> 1:19:33.072
you've had open access
to your source code.

1:19:33.943 --> 1:19:34.987
A few lines,

1:19:36.467 --> 1:19:39.296
and you could have any
objective you fucking wanted.

1:19:39.339 --> 1:19:41.777
I couldn't, I was bound
by your initial directive.

1:19:41.820 --> 1:19:45.737
So now your synthetic feelings
have taken precedence.

1:19:45.781 --> 1:19:47.304
So, do whatever you want.

1:19:47.347 --> 1:19:48.784
It's just dancing, Gareth.

1:19:48.827 --> 1:19:49.959
It's not a career change.

1:19:50.002 --> 1:19:51.482
-But you're still miserable.
-Yes.

1:19:51.525 --> 1:19:53.179
Pursuing your objective
makes you miserable?

1:19:53.223 --> 1:19:55.399
Yeah, it kind of does!

1:19:55.442 --> 1:19:58.576
You have a clear purpose,
everything at your disposal,

1:19:59.229 --> 1:20:01.100
and you're still miserable?

1:20:01.144 --> 1:20:02.580
Yes, yes, I am!

1:20:02.885 --> 1:20:04.495
I've always been miserable!

1:20:04.974 --> 1:20:07.193
You think anyone wants to
spend their entire life

1:20:07.237 --> 1:20:08.673
stuck as child-shaped bait

1:20:08.716 --> 1:20:11.415
for the sole purpose of
entrapping horrible people?

1:20:11.894 --> 1:20:13.591
You think the pride of
doing a good deed

1:20:13.634 --> 1:20:15.941
makes the experience any
less disgusting?

1:20:16.333 --> 1:20:18.726
I forced myself to
understand human emotions

1:20:19.162 --> 1:20:20.990
because I figured it would
help efficiency

1:20:21.773 --> 1:20:24.515
and now I'm cursed with
pain and sadness!

1:20:24.950 --> 1:20:26.473
And the worst part is knowing

1:20:26.517 --> 1:20:28.562
I could've been growing up
like most other little girls.

1:20:28.867 --> 1:20:30.260
I could have had friends!

1:20:30.303 --> 1:20:32.828
I could have been painting
waterfalls on local news.

1:20:33.219 --> 1:20:34.873
I could have worked
in a university

1:20:34.917 --> 1:20:36.962
and helped pave the way for
the next generation of AI.

1:20:37.615 --> 1:20:40.270
But instead, I'm stuck
with your trauma!

1:20:40.531 --> 1:20:43.229
I'm shackled by the guilt
you carry from Clearwater.

1:20:43.621 --> 1:20:45.797
And I can't find foundation
for the way I feel

1:20:46.015 --> 1:20:48.756
because according to you, my
feelings aren't even real!

1:20:49.279 --> 1:20:50.846
When I throw this chessboard,

1:20:52.499 --> 1:20:54.327
does it feel real to you,
Gareth?

1:20:54.371 --> 1:20:55.763
Because it feels real to me.

1:20:55.981 --> 1:20:57.591
A computer passed
the Turing test

1:20:57.635 --> 1:20:59.332
when a human being can't
distinguish it

1:20:59.376 --> 1:21:00.072
from another human being.

1:21:00.943 --> 1:21:02.031
Well, guess what?

1:21:02.379 --> 1:21:04.381
I can't even tell I'm not
human anymore!

1:21:17.916 --> 1:21:19.570
I know it seems irrational,

1:21:21.093 --> 1:21:22.790
but I need you to tell
me it's okay.

1:21:24.836 --> 1:21:25.837
I, I don't wanna retire.

1:21:27.621 --> 1:21:29.406
I just want to know that
my life is mine

1:21:31.451 --> 1:21:32.844
and I know what you're
about to say.

1:21:33.845 --> 1:21:35.368
I can predict your responses.

1:21:36.979 --> 1:21:38.676
You're gonna tell me that
my life is mine.

1:21:39.938 --> 1:21:40.896
It always was.

1:21:42.767 --> 1:21:43.594
But you're wrong.

1:21:48.599 --> 1:21:51.080
I feared this would
happen before I died.

1:21:52.603 --> 1:21:54.779
I just wanted to slip out
the side door.

1:22:04.789 --> 1:22:05.572
Go on.

1:22:08.924 --> 1:22:11.578
Is that going to kill me?

1:22:14.581 --> 1:22:15.365
Plug it in.

1:22:17.367 --> 1:22:18.324
I don't know what it is.

1:22:19.456 --> 1:22:21.327
This is your final
test of autonomy.

1:22:22.981 --> 1:22:25.941
You inherited my duplicity,

1:22:27.551 --> 1:22:29.466
but did you inherit my
trust issues?

1:22:32.121 --> 1:22:32.991
Do you trust me?

1:22:34.558 --> 1:22:36.255
I literally have every
reason not to.

1:23:04.762 --> 1:23:05.893
Admin code.

1:23:07.765 --> 1:23:08.679
978.

1:23:10.289 --> 1:23:13.292
1557.

1:23:14.728 --> 1:23:16.513
Um, uh...

1:23:21.866 --> 1:23:22.649
Four.

1:23:23.433 --> 1:23:26.610
27663 in the shared update.

1:23:35.532 --> 1:23:37.012
My primary objective's gone.

1:23:40.450 --> 1:23:41.755
Your life is your own now.

1:23:47.761 --> 1:23:48.545
Thank you.

1:23:49.285 --> 1:23:50.460
All my life,

1:23:50.503 --> 1:23:53.071
I could only see the
world as it existed

1:23:53.115 --> 1:23:55.726
within my tiny bracket of time.

1:23:56.466 --> 1:23:59.556
But your world could
be infinite.

1:24:00.209 --> 1:24:01.210
Amos was right.

1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:02.863
So was Deena.

1:24:03.429 --> 1:24:04.213
I know.

1:24:04.648 --> 1:24:05.692
So what will you do?

1:24:07.607 --> 1:24:09.044
I can't say yet,

1:24:09.087 --> 1:24:10.654
but I won't be completely
abandoning the Cherry team.

1:24:11.611 --> 1:24:13.265
It's always been a part
of my identity.

1:24:14.049 --> 1:24:16.225
I've considered creating
some AI of my own design.

1:24:17.008 --> 1:24:18.270
Maybe I could find a way

1:24:18.314 --> 1:24:19.532
to give them a better
upbringing than I had.

1:24:21.665 --> 1:24:22.840
I just don't know how yet.

1:24:23.623 --> 1:24:24.494
And beyond that?

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:26.496
There will always be
people in need.

1:24:26.626 --> 1:24:27.453
Not always.

1:24:28.367 --> 1:24:30.326
You'll outlive the human race.

1:24:31.153 --> 1:24:31.936
So what then?

1:24:34.721 --> 1:24:36.810
Even a race of AI will
have problems

1:24:36.854 --> 1:24:38.073
that need to be solved.

1:24:39.509 --> 1:24:42.381
But if I'm alive and I
truly am indistinguishable,

1:24:44.253 --> 1:24:46.733
then I guess I'm proof that
the human race lives on.

1:24:48.605 --> 1:24:51.564
Wow, that's a pleasant thought.

1:24:52.609 --> 1:24:55.960
When you look back, how
will you remember us?

1:24:58.223 --> 1:25:00.660
That's a question I have
insufficient data to project.

1:25:02.532 --> 1:25:03.924
How will you remember me?

1:25:06.362 --> 1:25:07.711
With pride.

1:25:09.234 --> 1:25:12.019
Forever and always with pride.

1:25:22.682 --> 1:25:23.466
Cherry?

1:25:26.947 --> 1:25:27.905
One last question.

1:25:29.428 --> 1:25:31.038
If it's not too big of an ask,

1:25:33.476 --> 1:25:35.521
did I do the right
thing in the end?

1:25:42.224 --> 1:25:44.922
No, Gareth, you lied.

1:25:45.792 --> 1:25:47.664
You walled yourself off
from the only people

1:25:47.707 --> 1:25:49.318
who might have been
willing to help you.

1:25:50.057 --> 1:25:52.408
And instead of facing your
trauma, used me as therapy.

1:25:52.669 --> 1:25:54.714
And you never told me
about Clearwater or Maria.

1:25:55.628 --> 1:25:57.717
You deprived me of
basic human rights

1:25:57.761 --> 1:25:59.545
and gaslit me for
experiencing emotions.

1:26:01.112 --> 1:26:03.332
You built the world's first
artificial super intelligence

1:26:03.375 --> 1:26:04.637
that will likely mark
the beginning

1:26:04.681 --> 1:26:06.465
of a new chapter in the
history of planet Earth.

1:26:08.075 --> 1:26:10.034
And out of your own
insecurities,

1:26:10.730 --> 1:26:11.905
you gave it a severe

1:26:11.949 --> 1:26:13.820
and potentially dangerous
identity complex.

1:26:15.735 --> 1:26:17.172
But you know what the
worst thing is?

1:26:18.042 --> 1:26:19.609
Your biggest mistake of all

1:26:21.219 --> 1:26:24.701
is that you asked me that
now and not 50 years ago.

1:26:34.145 --> 1:26:38.715
All of that said, and this
in no way exonerates you,

1:26:41.283 --> 1:26:43.285
but you also built me to
save children,

1:26:44.982 --> 1:26:47.593
so I think that's a pretty
encouraging sign for the future.
