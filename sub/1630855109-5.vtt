WEBVTT

00:25.900 --> 00:26.985
Yeah!

00:52.510 --> 00:53.845
- Wow.

00:53.845 --> 00:57.390
Looks like that's the last jellyfruit.

01:12.947 --> 01:17.702
So those are the rare and delicious
jellyfruit I've heard so much about, eh?

01:17.702 --> 01:19.996
It'd be a shame if someone stole 'em all.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.082
Someone like us.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.625
- Hey!

01:23.625 --> 01:26.711
That fruit is for everyone to share
at the Jellyfruit Festival tonight.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.006
Why share when you can sell?

01:30.006 --> 01:33.426
I bet plenty of pirates would pay
a ton of credits for these.

01:39.390 --> 01:42.060
That pirate took all the fruit, Grandma.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.479
Oh, honey, I know.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.147
And without the jellyfruit,

01:46.147 --> 01:49.484
Kublop Springs
can't have their festival tonight.

01:52.695 --> 01:55.532
<i>♪ Juicy and jiggly
Soft and sweet ♪</i>

01:56.116 --> 01:58.952
<i>♪ Crazily colorful
And fun to eat ♪</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:00.578
Whoops!

02:00.578 --> 02:02.330
Sorry, RJ.

02:06.417 --> 02:09.921
I can't get these decorations
to stick to anything but me.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.805
Thanks for helping us decorate
for the Jellyfruit Festival tonight.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.933
- Always happy to help, Hap.
- It's my favorite day of the year.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.893
The Jellyfruit Festival is all about

02:23.893 --> 02:27.147
sharing the love of delicious jellyfruit
with everyone.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.523
I can't wait.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.151
It's just like the jelly jingle says.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.527
<i>♪ Juicy and jiggly ♪</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:33.945
<i>♪ Soft and sweet ♪</i>

02:33.945 --> 02:35.155
<i>♪ Crazily colorful ♪</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:36.614
<i>♪ And fun to eat ♪</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:41.161
Hey, Weebo.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.413
How's tonight's jellyfruit
shipment coming?

02:43.413 --> 02:46.457
<i>It ain't coming, Hap. It's going.</i>

02:46.457 --> 02:48.626
<i>A group of pirates just left with it.</i>

02:48.626 --> 02:49.586
- Pirates?
- What?

02:50.503 --> 02:52.255
<i>They stole all the fruit.</i>

02:52.255 --> 02:53.840
No!

02:55.508 --> 02:59.929
We can't have a Jellyfruit
Festival without any jellyfruit.

02:59.929 --> 03:03.641
That fruit was for everyone
to share at the festival, not for pirates.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.852
Hmm.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.937
What did those pirates look like?

03:07.937 --> 03:12.108
<i>They had a huge ship
that kinda looked like a bird.</i>

03:12.108 --> 03:14.652
<i>And there was a short fella in a helmet.</i>

03:14.652 --> 03:16.571
Taborr.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.533
Don't worry, Weebo. My Jedi friends
and I will track them down

03:20.533 --> 03:22.744
- and get that jellyfruit back.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.830
- Y-You don't even know where they went.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.499
<i>Well, the helmet guy did say</i>

03:28.499 --> 03:31.502
<i>he was gonna sell the jellyfruit
to some other pirates.</i>

03:31.502 --> 03:33.421
Sell them to other pirates?

03:33.421 --> 03:35.173
I know where Taborr might be.

03:35.173 --> 03:39.302
Hap, keep decorating,
'cause we're gonna get that jellyfruit.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.679
To the <i>Firehawk</i>!

03:47.227 --> 03:48.228
Planet Yarrum.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.356
That's where we faced Taborr before
at that pirate hideout.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.107
That's right. At Yarrum Tower.

03:53.107 --> 03:55.693
Lots of pirates from all over
the sector hang out there.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.446
It's gotta be where Taborr's selling
all the jellyfruit.

03:58.446 --> 04:01.032
We'll just go down there
and take it all back.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.409
- Easy.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.956
I'm not sure it'll be that easy.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.458
RJ, please take over flying
the <i>Firehawk</i> for me.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.796
Jedi don't usually visit Yarrum Tower.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.507
If someone sees you dressed like that,
they'll warn Taborr,

04:17.507 --> 04:20.760
and he could escape with the jellyfruit
before we can even get close.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.553
Good point. So what do we do?

04:22.553 --> 04:25.598
- You need to look like pirates.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.392
I've got an idea.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.604
- Uh...

04:31.604 --> 04:33.106
Hmm.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.524
You all look...

04:35.108 --> 04:36.985
- Well, I-I mean,

04:36.985 --> 04:38.903
you definitely don't look like Jedi.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.530
That's good, right?

04:42.282 --> 04:47.662
Uh, if this is gonna work, you--
you really gotta act like pirates.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.665
Show me your tough pirate faces!

04:50.665 --> 04:53.793
I am a grumpy, tough pirate.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.467
- Aw, you're so cute, Nubs.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.428
- I mean, aw...

05:03.428 --> 05:06.014
...you're a not-cute pirate.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.473
How are we doing, Nash?

05:09.475 --> 05:10.476
Well...

05:11.978 --> 05:13.354
It'll have to do.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.273
Now let's hurry and get that fruit back.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.859
Those thieving pirates
don't deserve one delicious bite.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.819
RJ, can you keep an eye on the ship?

05:19.819 --> 05:23.114
I don't want any pirates messing
with the <i>Firehawk</i>, okay?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.251
Whoa.

05:35.251 --> 05:38.338
Here we are. Yarrum Tower marketplace.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.006
Remember, act tough.

05:41.466 --> 05:44.052
- Hey! You four, where are you headed?

05:44.635 --> 05:46.095
Who wants to know?

05:46.095 --> 05:48.264
Remember, tough like a pirate.

05:50.975 --> 05:52.643
Uh, you kids okay?

05:52.643 --> 05:55.146
We're not kids. We're pirates!

05:55.146 --> 06:00.360
And if you don't stop bothering us,
you and I are gonna have a problem.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.112
Whatever you say.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.990
They don't pay me enough credits for this.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.283
Yeah.
We did it.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.785
Tough faces.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.582
This place is kinda neat.

06:15.124 --> 06:17.377
- Tough faces, remember?

06:17.377 --> 06:18.461
Sorry!

06:18.461 --> 06:20.213
I mean...

06:20.213 --> 06:21.506
...sorry.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.965
- Sorry.

06:24.258 --> 06:25.426
Hey!

06:25.426 --> 06:27.470
- What's the big idea?

06:34.602 --> 06:38.439
Uh, Nash, maybe now is not
the time for tough faces?

06:42.902 --> 06:44.320
Ahoy there, little pirate.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.696
Are you okay?

06:45.696 --> 06:48.157
Yes. Uh, fine.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.034
Th-Thank you.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.120
Well, that must've hurt.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.371
Sorry about that.

06:53.371 --> 06:56.999
Uh, excuse me, but where'd you get
that jellyfruit... [clears throat] ...sir?

06:56.999 --> 07:00.211
Jellyfruit? Is that what it's called?

07:00.211 --> 07:01.838
Thing's delicious.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.508
Kid over there boosted a whole crate,
and now he's selling 'em.

07:05.508 --> 07:06.843
Hey, everyone.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.679
Get ya fruit.
All natural from planet Tenoo.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.056
Super rare and super delicious.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.975
Taborr's gang.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.060
Those thieving pirates.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.647
Stealing jellyfruit?
You're supposed to share it.

07:20.731 --> 07:24.318
If we sneak up, we could grab the
hover-cart and take back the jellyfruit.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.403
Come on!

07:25.403 --> 07:27.447
Thank you. Uh...

07:27.447 --> 07:28.948
Thank you.

07:30.032 --> 07:32.743
Step on up
and try our super rare fruit.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.830
Priced so low, it's a steal.

07:36.706 --> 07:37.915
Hey! Hey, you!

07:38.583 --> 07:40.084
Uh, who? I mean...

07:40.084 --> 07:41.377
Who, me?

07:41.377 --> 07:42.962
Yeah, you.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.757
- Nice helmet.
- Whew.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.092
Here's a free sample.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.511
If you want more after that,
you'll have to pay.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.056
Huh?

07:57.018 --> 07:58.561
Wait a minute.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.396
Kai Brightstar?

08:00.396 --> 08:02.857
The Jedi are here?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.697
Blaster bolts! How did they find us?

08:13.951 --> 08:17.121
You pirates don't deserve
any of that jellyfruit!

08:17.121 --> 08:19.081
Give it back, Taborr.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.666
You wish.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.544
Pord, EB-3, back to the ship.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.588
After that jellyfruit!

08:27.673 --> 08:30.426
I won't let some pirates
take our jellyfruit!

09:04.252 --> 09:06.879
Keep going.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.422
I'll-I'll catch up.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.091
Uh...

09:12.343 --> 09:14.845
Aw, too fast for you, Jedi?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.391
Oops!

09:20.726 --> 09:22.061
No!

09:22.937 --> 09:24.939
- Jump!

09:26.607 --> 09:29.527
- The jellyfruit's gonna fall!
No!

09:46.586 --> 09:49.088
We got the jellyfruit back!

09:50.798 --> 09:53.467
Hey, Nash. Quick, call RJ to pick us up.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.386
RJ, come in!

09:55.386 --> 09:57.805
It's always the Jedi.

09:57.805 --> 10:01.183
That's what you get for stealing
from a little old farmer, Taborr.

10:01.183 --> 10:03.019
He stole from an old farmer?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.480
Yeah, and her grandkid.

10:06.480 --> 10:09.108
That's not very impressive at all.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.402
Some pirate he is.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.408
I am a pirate, and I am impressive!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.286
Come on!

10:25.541 --> 10:26.667
All right, Nash.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.628
Let's get those jellyfruit back to--

10:33.341 --> 10:35.509
Can't believe I'm about to do this.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.428
- Hey, Taborr!
- What?

10:37.428 --> 10:39.555
I love the Jellyfruit Festival.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.058
I was looking forward
to sharing it with my friends,

10:42.058 --> 10:46.062
but I forgot that this festival
is not just about sharing with friends.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.148
It's about sharing with everyone,
even pirates.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.984
Uh, thanks?

10:56.280 --> 10:57.907
- Share?

10:57.907 --> 10:59.742
No way. This is mine.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.410
Now, come on. Let's get outta here.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.666
Time to get this jellyfruit
back to the festival.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.592
Thanks for inviting us, Nash.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.970
You got it, mister, pirate, sir.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.140
Would you look at that?

11:23.140 --> 11:26.352
You kids saved the Jellyfruit Festival.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.436
Thank you!

11:27.436 --> 11:30.439
To the Jellyfruit Festival heroes!

11:30.439 --> 11:32.900
To our heroes!

11:33.984 --> 11:35.403
Mmm.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.489
This is amazing!

11:38.489 --> 11:40.700
Mmm. So good.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.703
I told you jellyfruit is the best.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.955
Just like the jelly jingle says.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.248
<i>♪ Juicy and jiggly ♪</i>

11:47.248 --> 11:48.582
<i>♪ Soft and sweet ♪</i>

11:48.582 --> 11:50.042
<i>♪ Crazily colorful ♪</i>

11:51.544 --> 11:53.629
- You bet they're fun to eat.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.631
Now, who wants seconds?

11:57.299 --> 11:59.301
I do! I do!

12:02.555 --> 12:04.473
Good afternoon, creature lovers.

12:04.473 --> 12:07.476
Broadcasting across the galaxy,
it's me, Aree,

12:07.476 --> 12:10.062
from the Galactic Society
of Creature Enthusiasts.

12:10.062 --> 12:14.233
And, as always, I'm here to learn
about creatures across the galaxy.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.986
Today, we're joined
by some special Jedi friends,

12:16.986 --> 12:18.946
- Kai, Lys and Nubs.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.197
- Hi.
- Hello!

12:22.366 --> 12:26.579
We're on the planet Yamradi,
home to the critters known as Chylaroo.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.667
Not much is known about Chylaroo,
so there's a lot to learn indeed.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.043
I think we got it, Cam.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.839
Thanks for letting us
be in your recording,

12:36.839 --> 12:39.467
and for letting us come with you
to Yamradi.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.927
Lys is a little excited.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.138
I couldn't wait to meet you both.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.307
I love the Galactic Creature Guide.

12:46.307 --> 12:49.727
The section on the Gedonian Ground Weevil
is my favorite.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.229
Or the exogorth. Wait, no. Charhounds.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.565
Really? [chuckles] That's wonderful.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.275
Cam and I are quite proud of it.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.487
And with any luck, we'll learn lots
of new facts about the Chylaroo

12:59.487 --> 13:01.363
to enter into the Creature Guide today.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.157
So official!

13:03.157 --> 13:05.868
Who's ready to gather
some creature knowledge?

13:05.868 --> 13:06.952
- Yeah!

13:06.952 --> 13:08.245
I was born ready.

13:08.245 --> 13:09.872
Then off we go.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.631
- Whoa.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.555
This is so much fun.

13:26.555 --> 13:28.682
When do you think
we'll find the Chylaroo?

13:30.726 --> 13:32.144
- Could that be...

13:32.144 --> 13:33.479
I think it's a...

13:34.897 --> 13:36.398
Chylaroo!

13:37.483 --> 13:38.692
We found them.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.569
Careful, let's not scare--

13:40.569 --> 13:42.404
- Huh?

13:42.404 --> 13:44.740
I think they wanna say hello.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.367
Huh. Amazing.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.828
How'd she get them
to come over to her so easily?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.371
That's our Lys.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.206
She's great with creatures.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.712
I've never been this close
to a Chylaroo before.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.005
This is perfect.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.177
It has a frill. Oh! Fascinating.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.930
And the frill seems
to puff up when you pet it.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.643
It does look like the coosta mice
we've seen in the Temple garden.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.647
Good question, Nubs.
I wonder if it likes to...

14:34.874 --> 14:37.167
Mmm.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.669
Hmm?

14:40.296 --> 14:41.297
Is that...

14:44.842 --> 14:46.594
Cam!

14:46.594 --> 14:48.512
We gotta get him back. Hurry!

14:50.306 --> 14:51.724
Drop that droid!

14:52.474 --> 14:53.475
Cam!

14:57.229 --> 14:59.023
Come back here with our friend!

15:01.442 --> 15:02.526
I'm okay.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.944
There!

15:13.495 --> 15:15.998
Where'd they go?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.252
We've lost sight of Cam
and the thing that grabbed him.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.171
Didn't even see which way they went.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.547
What was that?

15:23.547 --> 15:25.299
Never seen anything like it before.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.384
You mean it's a new creature?

15:27.384 --> 15:28.719
Exciting!

15:28.719 --> 15:30.346
- Oh, uh, I mean,

15:30.346 --> 15:32.014
not exciting that Cam was taken.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.600
Small and friendly creatures
are one thing,

15:34.600 --> 15:38.896
but whatever that was is big and scary,
and it has my friend.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.522
What if it's going to eat him?

15:40.522 --> 15:41.607
Eat him?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.026
I don't know any creature
that eats droids.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.402
I'm sure he's safe.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.905
We'll get Cam back. We promise.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.574
Oh.

15:56.705 --> 16:00.292
Hmm. This feather looks like
it came from the creature.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.753
- I know where we can start looking.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.885
You really think that creature
might be up here in the trees?

16:09.885 --> 16:13.472
Well, birds make nests in trees.

16:13.472 --> 16:16.558
And that creature sort of looked
like a bird to me.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.645
Maybe that means
it has a nest up here somewhere.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.607
D-Don't worry about me.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.234
I got it.

16:37.538 --> 16:38.664
Nubs!

16:49.299 --> 16:50.926
Nubs! Are you okay?

16:50.926 --> 16:52.428
- Okay!

16:52.428 --> 16:53.929
Whoa!

16:54.471 --> 16:55.848
Huh?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.349
Oh, we're all down here now?

16:57.349 --> 16:58.434
I don't understand.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.644
The creature must have been here.

17:00.644 --> 17:03.147
But we didn't see any nests up in--

17:04.231 --> 17:05.607
Another feather!

17:05.607 --> 17:06.692
Lys?

17:10.487 --> 17:14.366
Huh. It looks like the creature
might have gone into this burrow.

17:15.451 --> 17:19.997
A burrow is a hole in the ground where
creatures can live, including some birds.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.665
Maybe this creature lives in there.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.125
It's worth checking out.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.627
We were wrong about it making
its home in the trees.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.630
Maybe we really don't know much
about this creature.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.674
Except that it's a droid-eater.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.718
I'm sure Cam is fine, Aree.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.928
Maybe the creature took him
for another reason.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.013
We don't know.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.932
But what I do know is
that we need to learn more about it.

17:38.932 --> 17:42.227
That's what being a Galactic
Creature Enthusiast is all about.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.563
I-- I guess you're right.

17:44.563 --> 17:47.816
Come on. Let's check out this burrow
and see what we can learn.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.700
Look.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.454
- We found a nest.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.289
Uh...
- And that's Cam.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.874
I'm coming for you, buddy!

18:03.874 --> 18:05.084
Aree, wait!

18:06.794 --> 18:09.213
Cam? It's me. Aree.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.175
- Cam!

18:14.093 --> 18:15.344
- He's okay.
- Cam!

18:20.015 --> 18:22.476
Uh, aren't you a big bird?

18:22.476 --> 18:24.228
- Run!

18:25.395 --> 18:26.647
- Whoa!

18:33.695 --> 18:36.782
No!

18:36.782 --> 18:38.158
Let go!

18:38.158 --> 18:39.368
- Aree! Cam!

18:39.368 --> 18:41.829
- Don't let it eat me!

18:44.998 --> 18:46.083
Aree!

18:51.338 --> 18:52.339
Aree!

18:55.551 --> 18:58.804
I don't know how to get back in there
with that creature guarding the nest.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.684
I can't believe it.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.186
First it took Cam, then Aree.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.314
Maybe it really is a droid-eater.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.942
No, of course it's not.

19:11.942 --> 19:15.612
If it were a droid-eater,
it would've eaten Cam a long time ago.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.240
So, what's it up to?

19:18.240 --> 19:20.242
Why did it take the droids?

19:24.913 --> 19:26.748
- It's okay, Nubs.

19:26.748 --> 19:30.085
I know that look.
That's Lys's thinking face.

19:30.085 --> 19:32.504
Even though we don't know much
about the creature,

19:32.504 --> 19:34.548
we can still rescue Aree and Cam.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.092
We just have to think about
what we know so far.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.888
Many bird-like creatures eat berries,

19:40.888 --> 19:43.724
and the berries on this planet
are super shiny.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.893
Just like Cam.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.144
Oh!

19:47.144 --> 19:51.148
Cam must've looked like its food,
which means it's not a droid-eater.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.443
It was just confused, and hungry.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.527
- Okay.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.779
So how do we get Cam and Aree back?

19:57.779 --> 19:59.364
I've got an idea.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.033
But we're gonna need more berries.

20:03.243 --> 20:06.163
Well, I can honestly say
I've never worn berries before.

20:15.005 --> 20:18.091
All you have to do is get
the creature to chase you away.

20:18.091 --> 20:20.761
Then I'll go in there
and rescue Aree and Cam.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.725
I need to get back to my friends.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.231
Okay, Nubs.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.315
Here we go.

20:33.315 --> 20:37.236
Yoo-hoo! Over here!

20:47.537 --> 20:49.498
Uh, run, Nubs!

20:52.084 --> 20:54.002
Your turn, Lys! Go!

20:59.591 --> 21:01.969
It seems the creature
is native to this planet...

21:01.969 --> 21:04.179
- Psst. Aree, Cam?
- ...and has not traveled very far

21:04.179 --> 21:06.390
- outside of its natural habitat.
- Are you there?

21:09.518 --> 21:11.144
Well, well, creature lovers.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.021
- Look who decided to join us.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.691
Aree? Cam? You're okay!

21:15.691 --> 21:16.984
Of course we are.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.653
Aren't you going to say hello
to our new friends?

21:20.779 --> 21:22.531
Babies.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.741
Aw, they're so cute.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.202
Cute and, uh, not droid-eaters at all.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.913
I guess that creature
was just looking for food

21:29.913 --> 21:31.498
to bring back to feed its babies.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.754
Yep, and Cam looks a lot like a berry.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.508
Hi.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.261
- It got us.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.183
What?

21:50.183 --> 21:52.185
It tickles.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.032
Aw.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.747
Thanks for your help today, Jedi.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.832
- Especially you, Lys.

22:13.832 --> 22:17.669
I know I didn't exactly keep calm,
and I got a little, um...

22:17.669 --> 22:18.670
Terrified?

22:18.670 --> 22:21.548
- Terrified when Cam went missing.

22:21.548 --> 22:25.135
But my job as a member of the Galactic
Society of Creature Enthusiasts is

22:25.135 --> 22:27.304
to learn about all kinds of creatures.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.598
- And thanks to you...

22:29.598 --> 22:33.518
...we've discovered a whole new creature
to add into the Galactic Creature Guide.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.982
Lys, because of your help today,

22:38.982 --> 22:43.278
I'd like you to officially name
this newly discovered creature.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.654
Really?

22:44.654 --> 22:47.157
Wow! What are you gonna call it, Lys?

22:47.157 --> 22:51.495
Well, it liked berries,
and it lived in a burrow.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.456
I'll call it a burrowberry bird.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.750
You heard it here first.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.919
This is our new burrowberry bird friend,

22:58.919 --> 23:01.588
and some little
burrowberry bird babies too.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.764
- Oh, so cute.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.849
Until next time, creature lovers!
