WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:03.538
(Andy) What about this one?

00:03.587 --> 00:05.748
Mm. Gunshot.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.662
- Really?
- (chuckles) No.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.800
Neighbor's dog. I think l was, like, 5.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.177
Mean little bugger.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.883
You or the dog?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.764
(chuckles) Both, probably.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.135
- What about this guy?
- Hmm?

00:21.730 --> 00:23.015
The one on your wrist.

00:25.192 --> 00:29.185
Oh, I was building a dock at the cabin.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.524
There was a piece of wood with a nail in it.

00:31.573 --> 00:32.779
It really didn't hurt that much.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.111
Mmm.

00:38.705 --> 00:44.951
(woman)
.l‘ You're confused but I cannot pretend .l‘

00:45.003 --> 00:50.589
J‘ Swimming cold water under the rain .l‘

00:51.343 --> 00:56.679
J‘ Your frozen hand feels sober and sane .l‘

00:57.558 --> 00:59.014
(siren wailing in distance)

00:59.059 --> 01:01.721
IPmnI

01:03.230 --> 01:09.066
.l‘ Who feels like this? J‘

01:09.444 --> 01:10.854
.l‘ | feel... .l‘

01:10.904 --> 01:12.064
(Luke) Everything all right?

01:13.156 --> 01:15.067
Yeah. I'm just getting a glass of water.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.743
J‘ Like it feels .l‘

01:35.345 --> 01:37.336
Hey, I was actually worried.
You know, you could've called.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.380
Well, I figured you'd be asleep.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.056
l was up all night cleaning.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.926
Hey, you know they make this thing,
it's like an-- uh, it's like an eraser,

01:43.979 --> 01:45.094
you can get stains off the walls?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.187
You actually cleaned our apartment?

01:47.941 --> 01:48.930
Well, it's a long weekend.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.901
- Denise is coming down from Timmins.
- Denise?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.777
Well, I haven't heard you talk
about her in a while.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.359
I figured you guys broke up.

01:56.408 --> 01:59.400
We did once, in the 11th grade,
but she took me back.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.785
Is she gonna be here all weekend?

02:01.830 --> 02:03.866
- Why?
- Because Ijust found out

02:03.915 --> 02:05.496
in the best possible way,

02:05.542 --> 02:08.033
flight attendants
have a serious thing for cops.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.168
Last night--two-on-one.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.374
Tonight they have a friend
that wants to meet you.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.547
Denise wants me to propose.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.628
Propose what?

02:15.677 --> 02:18.760
Well, she says that, um...

02:20.015 --> 02:21.630
She--she told me, actually,

02:21.683 --> 02:24.299
that it's been way too long
without a real commitment,

02:24.353 --> 02:27.436
and, um, you know, seven years, so...

02:27.481 --> 02:28.561
What the hell are you gonna do?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.733
(sighs) No clue, man.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.859
(siren wailing in distance)

02:39.201 --> 02:40.236
(Traci) You walked out on him?

02:40.285 --> 02:43.903
Yeah, I did. 'Cause l'm--| don't know.
I'm used to being alone, you know?

02:43.955 --> 02:45.820
- I like to sleep in my own bed.
- I think it's weird.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.786
You're weird. Okay, you're not,
but you're touchy this morning.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.417
- I know. It's my k-i-d.
- Leo?

02:52.464 --> 02:53.544
Oh, right. They can't spell.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.252
Well, if I'd known you couldn't keep a secret
to save your life...

02:56.301 --> 02:59.213
Come on. You have an adorable 6-year-old.
I don't know why it has to be a secret.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.594
Well, it's on my own terms, okay?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.055
Everyone'd treat me different,
look at me different.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.511
So what's up with Leo?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.142
Hates me, hates myjob,
wants to go live with daddy,

03:08.188 --> 03:09.803
all because he can't go
to the Fenelon Fair this Saturday.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.141
And what am I supposed to do?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.056
Tell him his dad bowed out on him
at the last minute?

03:13.110 --> 03:15.567
- So what's daddy's problem?
- Oh, daddy's distracted.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.568
He's slippin' it to a yoga teacher he met in NA.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.481
Ooh. Who's slippin' it to the yoga teacher
they met at N.A.?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.523
Your mother.

03:21.576 --> 03:24.192
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey, careful. Man's on a deadline.

03:24.246 --> 03:27.659
He's gotta propose or lose the girl he's loved
since he had grass on the field.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.823
(click)

03:29.334 --> 03:32.417
So... are you gonna propose?
(chk)

03:32.462 --> 03:34.168
Well, you know, I love her, so...

03:36.049 --> 03:37.084
Why not, right?

03:37.884 --> 03:40.296
- Well, congratulations.
- Thanks.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.301
Yeah, it's a good plan.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.054
Why play the field in the big city
with your best friend

03:45.100 --> 03:47.512
when you can restrict yourself
to your banjo-playing second cousin?

03:47.894 --> 03:50.351
You know what? Denise is a special girl,
and I'm not--

03:50.397 --> 03:52.763
And I'm sure you'll be very happy together.
Come on.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.810
Psst.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.607
Hey.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.189
Right. And you are?

04:03.326 --> 04:04.577
Sorry.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.531
It's just, you know, I have trouble
sleeping in other people's beds.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.493
It's weird, I know.
It's just this thing that l have.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.373
It's all right. I get it.
It's just, you know, when you...

04:12.419 --> 04:14.535
wake up alone and you wonder
where someone's gone,

04:14.588 --> 04:15.828
it can kind of ruin your whole day.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.918
Well, it's early.
Your day could still turn around.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.376
- You joining us for parade?
- Yes, sir.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.169
Okay, then. Anytime.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.428
Everybody's got a plan.
Everyone's off to the cottage

04:33.482 --> 04:36.269
with a case of beer
and a fistful of firecrackers.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.400
Everyone's gonna spend
three long days grilling

04:38.987 --> 04:40.693
and lounging on the dock--

04:40.739 --> 04:43.947
everyone but you, 'cause you are working.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.233
Detective Erico?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.527
(lowered voice) Go get 'em.

04:48.747 --> 04:53.036
Last long weekend,
there were 11 high-end B&Es--

04:53.084 --> 04:56.212
total take estimated close to $600,000.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.870
Last week, they assaulted a housekeeper
when she walked in on them,

04:59.508 --> 05:01.248
so proceed with caution.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.508
It's one crew, highly organized.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.589
They work with a lookout, carry radios.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.595
Alarm goes off, they don't care.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.882
They're in and out in four minutes.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.766
(whispering)
Want to come over later?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.303
l'll scare up a couple of steaks,
throw'em on the barbie?

05:14.481 --> 05:15.596
(whispers) I'm busy later.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.312
Really? But I already got them.
They're filet mignon.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.067
Anything to add, Detective Barber?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.488
(normal voice) You bet.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.444
Uh, one thing you should know is
they are dangerous.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.993
Housekeeper caught them in the act,
and they put the boots to her.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.905
So what I suggest to you
is proceed with caution.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.290
(Boyko) Serve, protect...

05:35.335 --> 05:37.326
and grill when you're retired.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.831
Go on. Get out there.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.294
(siren wailing in distance)

05:44.344 --> 05:46.960
So has, uh, Noelle let you drive yet?

05:47.013 --> 05:48.048
Not yet.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.217
Yeah, it's fun.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.675
Hey.

05:55.480 --> 05:59.314
My brother told me about
this new sushi place on King,

05:59.359 --> 06:01.315
and, well, it's always full.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.649
But since the suits are all
headed out of town this weekend...

06:04.698 --> 06:06.609
Well, you know,
if you maybe want to grab lunch

06:06.658 --> 06:08.148
or maybe after shift, get something to eat...

06:08.952 --> 06:10.488
- You and me?
- It's not a big deal.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.744
- Ijust thought maybe if you were hungry.
- No, no, it--it sounds fun.

06:12.789 --> 06:15.656
- It's just I can't 'cause I got plans this weekend.
- Fine.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.581
- Sorry.
- Whatever.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.702
- Some other time.
- Yeah, sure.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.094
(man on radio)
1503, advising on route selection...

06:30.640 --> 06:31.629
(woman on radio) Go ahead, 1503.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.226
Look, no one will pass me.
(chuckles)

06:38.064 --> 06:39.179
You are so evil.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.439
These people are already staring down
a barrel of stop-and-go traffic

06:41.484 --> 06:42.519
all the way up the 400.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.187
(Sam) Oh, oh, oh!
Oh! He didn't go for it.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.484
Stop it.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.398
You involved with Callaghan?

06:50.452 --> 06:52.192
(police radio chatter)

06:55.081 --> 06:57.242
I'm just saying you might want to be
a little careful, you know?

06:57.375 --> 06:59.707
Callaghan's good solid police, but, uh,

06:59.753 --> 07:01.584
he picks a different rookie every year.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.538
Thanks, yeah. I can take care of myself.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.798
Ah, the cat who walks by herself.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.958
Exactly.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.751
The cheese stands alone.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.595
You, of all people, should understand that.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.642
(woman on radio)
Stand by for the hotshot.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.892
We've got a B&E in progress at 37 Chadwick.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.806
The homeowner is in the house

07:19.856 --> 07:23.098
and reported that the front door
was forced open by a male party.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.391
Light it up.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.936
(siren wailing)
(Andy) 1505. We're en route.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.947
See ya.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.861
(woman on radio) Homeowner alone with infant,
hiding upstairs, bedroom closet.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.575
Says she can hear the intruder downstairs.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.580
Okay, hit the gas, Peck. Go.

07:39.626 --> 07:43.210
I am. Wait. ls it--is it a left here?

07:43.254 --> 07:45.040
(siren wailing)

07:45.090 --> 07:46.751
(Oliver) No, stop. lt's...

07:46.800 --> 07:48.040
(tires screech)

07:48.093 --> 07:50.300
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.881
Home invasion. They'll wait, I guess.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.011
I'm sorry.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.049
(siren wailing)

07:59.396 --> 08:01.978
(woman on radio) Please be advised.
There is a guard dog on the premises.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.393
(police radio chatter)

08:09.656 --> 08:10.771
(woman screaming)

08:10.824 --> 08:12.815
Get around back. Cut him off.

08:13.493 --> 08:17.111
(dog barking)

08:23.420 --> 08:25.160
(clanks)

08:33.346 --> 08:34.506
(Andy) Stop! Police!

08:43.023 --> 08:44.513
(barking, snarling)

08:45.150 --> 08:46.856
Augh! Unh!

08:47.193 --> 08:48.774
(grunting)

08:49.863 --> 08:51.694
- Sam!
- Would you calm down if I said, "nice boy"?

08:51.740 --> 08:54.197
That's it. Nice boy. Nice boy!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.274
What the hell are you doing?
Get that guy!

08:56.327 --> 08:57.362
Okay.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.528
All right. Aa-aah!
Ow, owl That hurts.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.052
(man on radio)
1505 en route for medical treatment.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.183
(woman) I need to call my husband.
(baby crying)

09:22.228 --> 09:24.480
Sure. It's just time's of the essence,

09:24.522 --> 09:26.683
so if I could ask you a few questions first...

09:26.733 --> 09:30.521
Um, Nash, could you help out Mrs. Wright?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.185
Martha. Martha is fine. Here.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.147
l have to call Paul. He's at work.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.691
I told him it's a long weekend.
No one else is going in.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.152
What-- Uh, so no one knew

09:40.205 --> 09:42.036
- that you were headed to the cottage today?
- No.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.744
No one else? You didn't stop the newspaper
or ask someone to bring in the mail?

09:44.793 --> 09:46.875
- No, look, it was just for the long weekend.
- Okay.

09:47.462 --> 09:48.747
(panting)

09:50.423 --> 09:52.709
This guy wasn't that organized.
Andy chased him,

09:52.759 --> 09:55.466
said he was tripping over
the cord of a $90 DVD player.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.627
And she couldn't catch him?

09:57.347 --> 10:00.259
Well, if it's just one guy,
it's not our B&E gang.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.185
That crew works in a group.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.933
They're pros...

10:05.688 --> 10:10.182
and they're sure as hell not gonna be
wasting their time on a DVD player.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.318
(Sam) There's no sign of entry or exit
from the lower level.

10:21.371 --> 10:24.488
(man on radio) This is S1.
Let's let PlV handle it from here.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.951
(Sam) Copy.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.619
Nothing down here.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.040
Of course there's nothing down here.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.875
Look, I know it's my fault the guy got away.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.336
It's just that there was the dog,
and I thought he was gonna hurt you.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.750
That's why there's two of us, right?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.839
One to deal with the dog,
one to get the bad guy.

10:38.888 --> 10:39.923
There's no one back there.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.173
House is clear. Let's head out.
After you.

10:43.226 --> 10:45.262
Oh, hey, so I heard you pinned that dog.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.977
Those German Shepherds--
they freak me out.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.638
Yeah, bark, bite.
Dogs don't scare me.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.482
Heavy sucker, though.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.774
Yeah, so if you make it down by 2:00,
then just- -just come on in.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.359
Okay. Yep. Well, I can't wait.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.074
Okay. Bye, babe. Bye.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.032
Did you just invite Denise to lunch?

11:06.708 --> 11:09.666
Well, you know,
it's just everyone's out of town.

11:09.711 --> 11:10.996
lt's dead.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.957
It's not like I'm gonna miss anything
if I take her to lunch, so--

11:14.007 --> 11:15.793
Except maybe the prime of your life--

11:15.842 --> 11:17.582
moments like I had last night

11:17.635 --> 11:20.297
when I realized I was buying drinks
for two airline hotties,

11:20.346 --> 11:22.132
trying to decide which one
I wanted to take home,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.298
and then I realized
I didn't have to choose.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.465
(knocking on glass)

11:26.561 --> 11:27.892
(mouths word)

11:28.646 --> 11:30.557
lt's Detective Erico.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.066
I need a good cop. Anyone free?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.146
For an interrogation?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.936
Pawnshop owner, interview three.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.611
We traced it back to one of our B&Es.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.948
- Boyko was in a pawnshop?
- A watch costs $50,000?

11:45.997 --> 11:47.032
Diaz, huh?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.740
You're looking particularly good to me.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.957
- Can |--
- You can watch.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.875
lneed”.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.510
Aha.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.177
Big boy's in there saying
he's gonna have a heart attack

12:07.227 --> 12:08.558
if I ask him any more questions.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.309
Thought I'd give him a couple minutes.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.844
To do what?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.889
- We're primates.
- So?

12:14.025 --> 12:15.310
Chris doesn't believe in evolution.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.692
So primates can't stand to be alone.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.319
Stick a monkey in a cage by himself
for a couple of days,

12:20.365 --> 12:21.980
he'll cuddle with a Kleenex.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.649
Couple weeks, he'll droop and die.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.739
- Well, what if he does?
- Does what?

12:27.914 --> 12:30.246
Well, you know,
have a heart condition or something.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.915
He's not gonna have a heart attack.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.326
He's not even short of breath.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.214
Guy's lying out of his ass.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.498
Just go in there and cuddle, Diaz.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.584
(door beeping)

12:50.728 --> 12:52.639
- Hey.
- (faintly) Hey.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.637
(Martha) I don't care if it was
one guy or 20 guys.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.806
You cannot leave me alone here.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.598
(Jerry) Ma'am, the suspect's long gone.

12:57.652 --> 12:58.732
I haven't even reached my husband yet.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.814
Please don't go--
at least until he gets home.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.194
Okay, okay, okay.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.071
Officer McNally can stay with you.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.029
Well, armed B&E is a 2—officer minimum.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.238
He wasn't armed.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.153
Fine. Nash can stay with McNally.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.571
Well, can I ride back with you, sir?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.036
Because Officer Shaw's gone back to the barn.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.120
Sounds good to me.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.164
This is your occurrence number, ma'am.
Insurance is gonna want that.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.174
(police radio chatter)

13:24.512 --> 13:26.468
(engine starts)

13:29.309 --> 13:30.344
(Chris) Can I get you a soda or something?

13:30.685 --> 13:32.892
How the hell's that gonna help?
You got the heat blasting.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.474
Yeah. It is hot in here.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.481
Uh, it's notjust in here, though.
It's, uh, it's the whole office.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.477
We're still finessing the art of interrogation.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.691
That's why I wanted a rookie.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.363
I needed to get a baseline on this guy,
see how he acts when he's not threatened.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.862
Toad on a lily pad.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.451
He's barely moving--

13:55.668 --> 13:57.829
conserving his energy for his big show.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.665
(door beeps)

14:00.506 --> 14:03.122
Ohh. I told you, | get chest pains.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.964
Oh, look at you. You're a mess...

14:08.514 --> 14:10.891
stuttering about a heart attack,

14:10.933 --> 14:12.639
squirming.

14:12.685 --> 14:13.970
(suspect breathing heavily)

14:14.020 --> 14:15.260
Turn off the cameras.

14:15.813 --> 14:20.523
- Uh, I don't think we're supposed--
- Turn them off.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.736
This one's a rookie.
Likes to play by the rules.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.524
(slams remote on table)

14:30.119 --> 14:31.734
Okay, Ronald...

14:33.623 --> 14:36.160
I'm gonna hook you up to a lie detector.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.246
There's no lie detector in here.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.910
I'm the lie detector.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.879
- You know, you can't turn the cameras off.
- You see me?

14:44.926 --> 14:46.257
I'm not new.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.510
I've been doing this for about 11 years.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.594
Somewhere along the way,
I realized I can do whatever I like.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.847
- Stand up!
- (stammering)

14:56.896 --> 14:58.181
(chair clatters)

14:58.231 --> 14:59.812
|--|--| don't know
where they get the stuff.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.104
Oh! Okay, okay. They told me today
there'd be a load of silver and china.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.269
- Silver from where?
- I don't know. They don't tell me.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.311
- Ron!
- (gaerS)

15:07.365 --> 15:09.071
Please don't lie to me!

15:09.909 --> 15:11.410
What kind of silver?

15:11.452 --> 15:14.034
(breathing heavily)
Um, I don't know.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.366
Uh, bowls, um, trays, salad tongs.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.576
Last time I got--

15:17.625 --> 15:19.991
I got two bread makers
still in their boxes.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.909
Uh...

15:23.005 --> 15:24.165
Sorry, it's just...

15:24.215 --> 15:26.171
Kind of sounds
like they're robbing a wedding.

15:28.845 --> 15:29.834
You know what?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.801
Kind of does.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.385
Sweetie, please.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.849
I heard something breaking.
I called 911.

15:40.898 --> 15:42.399
The guy was right downstairs.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.314
No, I'm--
Look, could you just come home?

15:47.572 --> 15:50.780
(sighs) No, he's not here anymore,
but, um...

15:51.701 --> 15:53.737
Can't you tell your client
it's the long weekend?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.993
Oh, my God.
Come home already.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.283
What kind of workaholic is this guy?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.459
- The douchebag kind.
- (Andy scoffs)

16:00.960 --> 16:02.996
I guess he figures
she's got the dog to keep her safe.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.581
Yeah, a lot of good that did.
The dog didn't even bark

16:04.630 --> 16:05.790
at the guy who broke in this morning.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.256
Did I tell you Gail asked me to go for sushi?

16:09.886 --> 16:12.127
- I think, as, like, friends.
- What? (laughs)

16:12.180 --> 16:14.136
Cold fish with Gail? Go figure.
(cell phone rings)

16:14.182 --> 16:16.047
My husband might be a while.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.636
Um, okay.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.267
Uh, maybe we should do an inventory,
see what's missing.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.019
He wants me to drive
to the cottage without him--

16:22.064 --> 16:24.020
the baby, the dog, just me.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.604
Huh. You'd think he could take
the weekend, right? But no.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.482
And then some loser
breaks into my house, and...

16:31.741 --> 16:32.821
Sorry. I'm...

16:34.076 --> 16:35.111
Excuse me.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.038
That was Leo's day care,
and it's a long weekend,

16:38.080 --> 16:40.207
so they're having a half day.
And I don't know--

16:40.249 --> 16:42.205
Maybe I forgot,
but I don't think that | forgot, but--

16:42.251 --> 16:44.037
Okay, Traci, calm down.
Can your mom go?

16:44.086 --> 16:45.246
I can't get ahold of her.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.336
(sighs) Fine. Go.
I'll be fine on my own.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.999
Half-hour, I swear. I'll be right back.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.220
Okay, I'll tell the station.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.002
No, no, no, no. Please, please.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.713
If you tell them I'm gone,
they're gonna ask why.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.132
They're not gonna ask why,
but I've gotta say something.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.598
Andy, look around.
Do you see a lot of women on this job--

17:02.647 --> 17:05.434
a lot of moms with a kid juggling this job?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.391
Leo is sitting there. I gotta go.

17:08.986 --> 17:09.975
Go.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.361
Half an hour. I swear. Thank you.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.112
I'd better check on the baby.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.023
Do you--do you mind
coming upstairs with me?

17:16.410 --> 17:17.616
Sure.

17:20.831 --> 17:22.446
I don't even know what a bread maker is,

17:22.500 --> 17:24.536
and you're like,
bread maker equals wedding?

17:25.086 --> 17:27.577
lt--it wasn't the bread maker.
It was the salad tongs.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.214
Yeah, me and Denise--

17:29.257 --> 17:31.043
That's what we'd always get people
as a wedding gift--

17:31.092 --> 17:34.209
you know, silver ones,
get 'em engraved, uh,

17:34.387 --> 17:37.254
"May these be your salad days,"
love, Chris and Denise.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.964
Still don't really know
what that means, but--

17:40.017 --> 17:41.097
(Oliver) Good news, bad news.

17:42.228 --> 17:46.847
Uh, good news is there really is only one
wedding scheduled for today in Rosedale,

17:46.899 --> 17:48.810
- so that kind of narrows it down.
- Bad news?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.396
Thanks to boy genius here,
we gotta stake it out,

17:51.445 --> 17:53.356
which could be a total waste of a day.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.317
A stakeout? Are you serious?

17:55.366 --> 17:57.322
"We" as in "all of us"?

17:57.368 --> 17:59.905
You boys up for it?
Could be, uh, could be kind of dangerous.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.367
- No stranger to danger, man.
- Yeah, we're totally up for it, sir.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.453
All right, well, good. Suit up.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.080
Uh...

18:10.881 --> 18:14.044
Sir, wouldn't we be a more intimidating
presence in our uniforms?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.543
Yeah!
Yeah, Diaz... (chuckles)

18:16.596 --> 18:19.053
You, uh, would be
a couple of uniform cops

18:19.098 --> 18:22.886
walking into the house that's presumably
being watched by our bad guys.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.475
Nobody is gonna take a second look
at a couple more guests showing up in suits.

18:29.150 --> 18:30.515
Buttons in the front.
(clicks tongue)

18:30.818 --> 18:31.978
Tags in the back.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.198
(horns honking)

18:39.243 --> 18:41.484
Come on!

18:43.039 --> 18:45.030
(siren wails)

18:47.043 --> 18:49.204
"Human lie detector."
That was amazing.

18:49.253 --> 18:50.709
I thought you couldn't
turn off the cameras.

18:50.755 --> 18:53.371
You can't. She didn't.
That was just some random remote.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.460
Hey, did you see the way
Erico looked at you?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.587
You propose to Denise,

18:57.637 --> 19:00.629
you might miss out
on your very own Sergeant Sexy.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.303
What kind ofjerk robs a wedding?

19:04.769 --> 19:06.976
Who cares? We're going undercover.

19:16.614 --> 19:17.774
Where is Leo?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.529
So sorry, Ms. Nash,
but we had to lock up.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.486
- You locked him in?
- We called his dad.

19:21.535 --> 19:22.820
Do you mind?

19:22.870 --> 19:25.782
- Excuse me?
- Your g-u-n is in my son's face.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.038
What do you mean,
you called his dad?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.290
You're an hour late.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.997
- So you just handed my kid over to Dex?
- Please move.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.708
I don't think it's appropriate
you wearing a g-u-n

19:34.757 --> 19:36.588
to pick up a child at this day care.

19:36.634 --> 19:40.126
Okay, lady, this g-u-n is safety holstered,
and the trigger guard is on.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.010
l have it because it is myj-o-b.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.382
(Martha)
So your partner has a child?

19:46.435 --> 19:47.515
(police radio chatter blares)

19:47.561 --> 19:49.392
Sorry.
(beep)

19:49.814 --> 19:53.181
How does she manage,
being a cop and taking care of a kid?

19:53.693 --> 19:57.311
Um, well, we're sort of new,
so I guess she doesn't really know yet.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.978
I can't imagine.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.022
When I was her age,
I didn't know what I was doing,

20:01.075 --> 20:02.736
let alone how to do it with a baby.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.446
Oh, you have another kid?

20:04.704 --> 20:06.410
Yeah. He's 22 now.

20:06.831 --> 20:08.662
Never really got along with Paul.

20:09.166 --> 20:13.125
Noah didn't make it very easy--
juvenile, drugs.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.421
Paul paid for rehab.

20:14.463 --> 20:17.250
Right after Noah got out,
he ended up in Quinley's.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.288
PHson?

20:18.342 --> 20:21.425
Three years, trafficking.
Crystal meth. lt's...

20:22.555 --> 20:24.841
Well, you love your kid, no matter what.

20:24.890 --> 20:29.600
(Andy) Yeah, prison--it's tough.
How's he doing?

20:29.645 --> 20:32.102
(Martha)
I've been meaning to go and see him.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.064
(clatter)

20:38.738 --> 20:40.353
(clank)

20:40.406 --> 20:41.737
(cell phone rings, beeps)

20:42.283 --> 20:43.272
Swarek.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.111
(Andy, lowers voice) Mrs. Wright has a son
from a previous marriage--

20:45.161 --> 20:48.449
22. Uh, he was locked up
a couple years ago for trafficking.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.112
(Sam) She doesn't tell us this at the scene?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.703
Well, he's still in prison,
but could you just check anyway?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.788
Noah Davis, born 1988.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.669
(Erico)
One and two are in play.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.247
- About damn time.
- (Chris) Sorry?

21:00.301 --> 21:01.962
You boys better have David.
I mean, come on.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.751
My daughter's headed to the altar,
and there's no groom?

21:05.765 --> 21:09.053
Mr. Burton, we believe
your house may be the target

21:09.101 --> 21:12.184
of a robbery this afternoon.
Can we come in?

21:13.355 --> 21:15.937
Uh, you--you lost your groom?

21:19.236 --> 21:21.352
I'm here with Mr. Burton.
I'll keep you posted.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.781
Over and out.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.073
(Erico chuckles)
I swear, they get younger every year.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.077
(chuckles) Man. "Over and out."

21:33.167 --> 21:35.783
Hey, you know what I would do
if I was gonna knock that house over?

21:35.836 --> 21:37.292
lnfiltrate the alarm company?

21:38.464 --> 21:41.126
What, you're kidding, right?
Get a job to do a job?

21:42.343 --> 21:44.083
l'd walk up. I would knock, flash my badge,

21:44.136 --> 21:46.252
and I'd tell them that we think their house
is about to get robbed.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.670
(chuckles)

21:48.432 --> 21:49.592
l was on my way there to get him.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.849
It's no problem. Just glad you're here.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.555
We're about to head out to the cottage.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.596
Well, maybe you could take Leo along.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.686
Jeez, Traci, I don't know.
I mean, it's Della's parents' place, and...

22:05.032 --> 22:08.115
Sorry, okay?
Just, it's the long--

22:08.160 --> 22:10.492
Weekend, I know.

22:11.539 --> 22:12.904
Well, I gotta get back to work,

22:12.957 --> 22:15.790
so maybe you could just
go get me my child.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.042
(cell phone rings, beeps)
Hey, what'd you get?

22:26.095 --> 22:28.962
Noah Davis was released
from prison on Saturday.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.551
Might want to tell his mom
to keep better track of him.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.976
Well, did he get released to anyone?

22:33.018 --> 22:36.931
According to his parole officer,
uh, he's staying with a guy named... what?

22:36.981 --> 22:38.312
Sean Spruitt.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.973
- Sean Spruitt.
- At 16 Nicholas Street.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.436
16 Nicholas Street.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.397
Smart money says he's our runner.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.822
We're on our way there now.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.322
Great, okay.
(flips cell phone shut)

23:33.203 --> 23:34.283
(Oliver) All right.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.908
Get to the church already.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.043
Good.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.121
So you think these thieves are gonna try

23:42.171 --> 23:45.208
the old, uh, "knock, knock,
we're making a delivery" routine?

23:45.257 --> 23:46.997
Not if they know everybody's gone.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.257
If it were me--

23:48.302 --> 23:50.543
throw on a mask, knock down the front door,
in and out, five minutes.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.633
Well, but, Jess, you have bigger balls
than the average criminal.

23:54.183 --> 23:59.303
50 bucks says that they show up
decked out like party rental delivery guys.

23:59.355 --> 24:02.563
(Erico laughs)
Double it. These guys are pros.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.645
- Oh, yeah? All right, well...
- Bam.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.685
Wow. I might have to hit an ATM.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.198
We're taking pictures, for God sakes.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.777
Look at you. Take a little responsibility.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.742
No, I'm sorry, baby. It was last-minute.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.154
They think these guys
are breaking into houses

24:18.207 --> 24:20.072
while everyone's away at the church
for the wedding.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.578
Yeah. Well, so we're staking it out.

24:24.630 --> 24:28.248
What she sees in you, l have no idea,
but, son, you'd better deliver--

24:28.300 --> 24:31.417
not just today but for the rest of your life!

24:32.012 --> 24:33.513
Yes... sir.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.420
No, I don't know how long.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.430
Baby, this is--
this is gonna be huge. ljust...

24:39.144 --> 24:40.224
Denise?

24:47.194 --> 24:50.106
I guess Denise really had
her heart set on lunch, huh?

24:53.117 --> 24:54.448
(Sam) So where's Noah?

24:54.493 --> 24:56.905
(Sean laughs)
- You think I'm funny?

24:56.954 --> 24:58.865
You're the guy the dog took down, right?

24:58.914 --> 25:00.620
I am that guy.
How come you're not?

25:00.666 --> 25:02.952
Noah brought doggy treats.
He didn't need 'em.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.288
The dog just wagged his tail
and jumped all over him.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.295
Man, I never could understand
why people let dogs lick their face.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.422
Yeah, me neither. Where's Noah?

25:10.968 --> 25:13.300
I don't know, man. Hey.

25:19.101 --> 25:21.183
(siren wailing in distance)

25:23.397 --> 25:26.184
Hey, hey, hey.
|--| was just along for the ride, man.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.270
Noah said if I could get us past the alarm,
I could take whatever I wanted.

25:29.319 --> 25:32.527
So, uh, rob mom and dad--
that was Noah's brilliant plan, huh?

25:32.573 --> 25:34.279
They wasn't supposed to be there.

25:34.324 --> 25:36.736
Anyhow, it's not his dad.
It's his stepdad.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.652
He really hates the guy--
edible thing.

25:39.705 --> 25:40.990
Edible?

25:41.040 --> 25:44.328
Yeah, you know, loves mommy,
wants to kill daddy. That thing.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.588
So where's Noah now?

25:48.630 --> 25:51.838
I don't know. Cops came.
Dog went all ape. I ran.

25:51.884 --> 25:52.999
Noah was in the basement.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.667
You took off, but Noah didn't?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.757
l have no idea, man.
For all I know, he's still down there.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.521
Why wouldn't he call me?
Why wouldn't he tell me he was out?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.980
Well, I mean, you never went to see him.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.064
After the whole rehab fiasco,

26:13.113 --> 26:15.149
Paul sort of made it clear
it was either him or Noah.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.778
But still...
(door opens downstairs)

26:18.827 --> 26:20.237
(man) Martha, I'm home!

26:20.287 --> 26:21.902
(Martha) I'm up here, honey!

26:28.378 --> 26:30.369
Tell me they didn't get
the video camera.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.585
That camera was brand-new.
This is who they sent?

26:33.634 --> 26:36.376
You called 911, they sent her?

26:36.428 --> 26:38.464
Actually, there were a lot
of officers and cars here,

26:38.514 --> 26:40.880
but I was left to keep Mrs. Wright company
until you came home.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.844
Other cars and officers.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.724
You clowns didn't catch the guy, did you?

26:44.770 --> 26:47.227
Amazing. Nice work.

26:47.940 --> 26:48.929
(slam)

26:48.982 --> 26:51.064
(Martha, lowers voice)
Paul! You'll wake her.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.360
(footsteps descend stairs)

27:07.793 --> 27:11.081
Ahh. I should've known.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.463
So they let you out.
Let me guess--um, good behavior?

27:15.759 --> 27:16.999
Stay away from me.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.883
Well, genius, you're headed
right back there now.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.466
Did you, uh, do you want to say
hi to your mother first?

27:21.515 --> 27:23.255
Leave me alone. I'm outta here.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.094
Hey. What's the matter?
What's the matter?

27:25.144 --> 27:27.100
You're scared to see her, huh? Is that it?

27:27.146 --> 27:29.683
Yeah, let me go. Let me go, I mean it.
I mean it!

27:29.731 --> 27:31.938
You little punk! Stealing my stuff.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.726
What now, huh? Off to get high?

27:34.778 --> 27:36.939
Right, your house, your wife, your stuff--

27:36.989 --> 27:38.854
(crash, Noah shouting)

27:43.287 --> 27:44.743
I told you to leave me alone.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.403
Police! Don't move.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.952
Noah! What are you doing?!

27:49.501 --> 27:50.490
(Andy) Nobody move!

27:56.508 --> 27:57.497
(Martha) Noah!

28:01.263 --> 28:03.219
(siren wailing)

28:03.265 --> 28:05.381
Come on, McNally.
Come on, pick up!

28:05.434 --> 28:08.426
(siren wailing, tires screech)

28:09.897 --> 28:13.105
Mom, Ijust need you to take him
till after I finish shift.

28:13.150 --> 28:17.063
Buddy, hey, you're gonna be
at your dad's next weekend.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.818
Okay? All weekend.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.355
Thank you. Thanks, mom.
Thanks, okay.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.615
Yeah, I'll see you in five. Thanks.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.652
Who's that lady with daddy?

28:26.705 --> 28:30.493
That's... your dad's friend
who has a cottage.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.158
(cell phone rings)

28:33.212 --> 28:35.669
(ring, beep)

28:35.714 --> 28:36.874
Nash.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.540
Get everyone out of the house.
I think the son's still in there.

28:40.469 --> 28:41.675
I'm not there.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.052
What the hell you mean, you're not there?
Where are you?

28:49.770 --> 28:52.386
- What do you think of me now, Paul?
- (Paul) You wouldn't dare.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.600
Noah, put the gun down.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.187
Oh, big man. You got my gun.
You even know how to fire it?

28:57.236 --> 28:59.022
- (Martha) Noah, please put the gun down.
- I'll show you.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.186
- I hate you.
- What are you doing, Paul?

29:00.239 --> 29:01.228
(Andy) Don't make this worse
than it already is.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.613
- Stop talking, okay?
- (Paul) Don't you see?

29:03.659 --> 29:05.365
- lt's Noah's job to make things worse.
- Paul, stop it.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.366
- That's how he gets her attention.
- (Andy) Noah, listen to me.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.118
You can't solve this with a gun.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.495
You don't know what
he's done to my mom.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.701
Noah, this is not Paul's fault!

29:12.751 --> 29:15.242
You treat the dog
better than you treat me!

29:15.295 --> 29:17.081
- (Martha) I love you!
- Come on. You're a drug addict.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.257
A criminal.
You think she wants you around?

29:19.549 --> 29:21.289
Let the woman have a fresh start already.

29:21.343 --> 29:22.332
Would you shut it?

29:23.136 --> 29:26.094
Noah, your mother loves you.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.050
Okay, she may be mixed up,
but she loves you.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.887
- Don't give me that, okay?
- I do! You know that I do.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.222
'Cause you don't know.
You don't know.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.352
Yeah? You think I don't know?

29:34.815 --> 29:36.521
l was abandoned in the middle of the night
by my mother.

29:37.150 --> 29:40.608
Okay, she has an entirely new family,
and l was completely erased.

29:40.654 --> 29:43.270
lt messes you up. I know.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.109
I haven't seen my mother in 14 years.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.994
Your mother is right here.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.284
Don't do this.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.124
Come on. Put the gun down.

29:54.001 --> 29:57.243
(Martha) Please, Noah.
Just put it down. It's okay.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.911
(Andy) Put down the gun.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.418
(Martha) I'm sorry.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.054
(Noah grunts)
(Martha) Stop! Paul!

30:09.099 --> 30:10.088
- In my house? You piece of trash!
- (Martha) Don't hurt him!

30:10.642 --> 30:11.631
Huh?

30:12.185 --> 30:13.846
- (Martha) Paul, stop it!
- How do you like that?

30:14.104 --> 30:15.514
- Aah!
- (Martha) No!

30:18.275 --> 30:19.435
- Be quiet!
- (Andy) I've got the gun, sir.

30:20.902 --> 30:21.891
Don't move.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.019
(Andy on radio) I need E.M.S. on scene
at 37 Chadwick.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.482
(Martha) Noah, are you hurt?

30:26.700 --> 30:27.815
(yawns) Hear anything, boys?

30:27.868 --> 30:29.574
No. You guys see anything?

30:29.619 --> 30:33.157
Uh, not so far.
This is one sleepy street.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.076
And to think my day started out so well.

30:39.129 --> 30:42.713
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Flight attendants.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.132
(Chris) So what did you even do
with those two girls?

30:46.178 --> 30:48.669
(Dov) Well, that was the beautiful thing
about these two girls.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.257
Kid's radio's on.

30:50.849 --> 30:51.964
He must be sitting on it.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.848
Yeah, every rookie does it once.
I never did.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.220
I mean, they were running the show,
totally and completely.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.637
Wasn't up to me.

31:00.108 --> 31:01.097
Are you lying?

31:01.943 --> 31:03.194
I mean, these girls--

31:03.236 --> 31:05.397
they really know how to take charge.

31:05.447 --> 31:08.109
(Dov) That's what I'm trying to say.
That's what you're missing out on.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.570
I hope I'm making myself clear,
because flight attendants--

31:10.619 --> 31:12.484
- in charge.
- You're doing the hand thing.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.744
You're moving 'em all around,
and you're doing that eye--

31:14.790 --> 31:16.451
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.161
- Yes.
- No, I'm not lying.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.499
I slept over.

31:20.545 --> 31:24.163
- (laughs) I knew-- you slept over?
- Yeah, I slept over.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.673
(Dov) It was late. They were hungry.
They got some food,

31:26.718 --> 31:28.458
and then they had to catch a flight.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.969
- You're so full of it.
- Okay, whatever.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.801
When was the last time you had a threesome
with two smokin' hot chicks?

31:35.227 --> 31:37.434
Have you ever even slept with somebody
who wasn't Denise?

31:37.479 --> 31:39.595
- Ohh.
- (Oliver exhales deeply)

31:42.317 --> 31:43.818
See the look on that groom's face today?

31:45.028 --> 31:47.735
You have slept with someone
other than Denise, right?

31:49.074 --> 31:50.234
He had the thousand-yard stare.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.274
You haven't, have you?

31:52.327 --> 31:55.660
I made outwith Krista Bloom
in the 11th grade,

31:55.705 --> 31:57.115
when Denise and l were broken up.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.247
(Dov) Oh. (laughs) Okay, good.
That's going in the vault.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.624
(Chris) Okay. I...

32:02.254 --> 32:03.289
Have you?

32:06.425 --> 32:07.790
I don't think I can propose to her.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.672
(radio beeps, static crackles)

32:11.721 --> 32:13.427
- Oh. What's--
- Uh...

32:13.473 --> 32:14.974
Has your radio been on this whole time?

32:15.016 --> 32:16.802
(both laugh)

32:16.852 --> 32:18.217
Oh-ho-ho--
Oh, there's our guys.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.394
(Erico) lt's go time, rookies.
Suspects are on the scene.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.021
Looks like three bodies.

32:23.984 --> 32:25.724
Okay, boys, bodies coming in.
Take down, take down!

32:26.611 --> 32:27.600
Let's go.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.781
Police! Don't move!
Let me see those hands!

32:41.710 --> 32:43.871
Shaky?

32:43.920 --> 32:45.376
I'm fine.

32:46.548 --> 32:49.164
Sometimes things go sideways.
It's not your fault.

32:49.718 --> 32:50.707
Yeah.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.048
What a cluster. Where's Nash?

32:57.017 --> 32:58.598
- Um...
- What, you telling me Nash isn't here?

32:58.643 --> 32:59.632
Where the hell is she?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.094
Ask her.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.562
What happened?

33:12.616 --> 33:15.733
Do you not know the number one rule
is never, ever leave your partner?

33:15.785 --> 33:17.366
- (stammers)
- Never leave your p--

33:20.290 --> 33:21.780
Whose is that?

33:21.833 --> 33:23.118
That's my son.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.798
Kid breaks into my house,
pulls a gun on me,

33:31.843 --> 33:33.049
you put me in handcuffs?

33:36.348 --> 33:39.181
This is a nightmare.
Boyko's gonna have my badge.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.304
l'm great. Thanks for asking.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.139
Whoa. Hey.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.974
Hey, what? You left me alone.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.979
|--| didn't know.
The house was clear.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.515
Except it wasn't.

33:48.735 --> 33:49.941
You said you were fine.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.647
Well, good thing I was, huh?

33:52.697 --> 33:55.439
Well, yeah. You never need anything.
You don't need anyone. Good job.

33:55.492 --> 33:57.824
Me? I'm about to get fired.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.860
- Congrats.
- Whatever.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.788
I'm trying to sort out exactly what happened.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.296
It's my fault, sir.

34:12.342 --> 34:15.004
I left my rookie at the house
when we dissolved the perimeter.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.260
l was under the impression
that the house had been cleared.

34:17.305 --> 34:18.806
What gave you that impression?

34:18.848 --> 34:19.837
We'd searched it.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.803
Noah knew the house.
I mean, he knew exactly where to hide.

34:22.852 --> 34:27.846
Officer McNally, I need to understand
how the hostage situation developed.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.309
Like I said, sir, it's my fault.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.769
My gun wasn't loaded.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.901
| forgot to load my gun this morning.

34:47.877 --> 34:48.957
You're not the first.

34:49.713 --> 34:51.249
It happens.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.872
That's why you have a partner.

35:27.375 --> 35:28.751
Let me tell you something
about partners, okay?

35:28.793 --> 35:30.579
You back 'em up, no matter what.

35:30.629 --> 35:31.789
- I know that.
- You know that?

35:31.838 --> 35:34.796
So why'd you let Nash dangle back there?
Boyko's gonna be very unhappy.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.832
- Yeah, well, she--
- You knew she was leaving, right?

35:36.885 --> 35:38.341
You must've told her it was okay.

35:39.095 --> 35:42.178
Look, | get it, okay--
what you said to that kid.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.010
Your mother left you.
You felt abandoned.

35:45.060 --> 35:46.516
Now you want to stand alone.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.552
But in this job, you can't do it alone.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.641
You have to have each other's back.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.640
You stand behind your partner always.

36:01.451 --> 36:04.909
(man)
J‘ You turn me over and look .l‘

36:07.832 --> 36:10.118
.l‘ It's not like .l‘

36:11.002 --> 36:13.414
.l‘ I need it .l‘

36:15.340 --> 36:20.380
.l‘ We haven't spoken in days now .l‘
(knock on window)

36:21.846 --> 36:26.055
.l‘ 'Cause you don't care J‘

36:28.561 --> 36:31.644
.l‘ That's what probably .l‘

36:32.273 --> 36:35.060
.l‘ ls making me .l‘

36:35.610 --> 36:37.817
.l‘SadJ‘

36:40.240 --> 36:41.446
(telephone ringing)

36:41.866 --> 36:42.855
(door buzzes)

36:43.535 --> 36:46.117
You gonna run, or, uh, should I cuff you?

36:47.038 --> 36:49.324
- You should probably cuff me.
- (Luke chuckles)

36:50.125 --> 36:52.241
I'm really sorry about this morning.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.537
lt's just...things get heavy,
and | start to get vulnerable,

36:56.589 --> 36:59.672
and so |--| take off, every time.

36:59.718 --> 37:02.300
So you're a cop with intimacy issues.
Join the club.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.972
Look if it doesn't work for you,
you don't have to sleep over.

37:08.727 --> 37:10.683
Perfect. Then we'll just have sex in your car.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.516
Or we could go to your place.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.806
Or we don't have to sleep at all.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.099
(chuckles)

37:18.194 --> 37:20.685
Go to the Penny.
Laugh with your friends.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.400
It'll be better tomorrow.

37:22.449 --> 37:23.859
Oh, yeah?

37:23.908 --> 37:25.899
It always is.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.367
(kiss)
Go on. Get out of here.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.155
.l‘ And I'm turning over .l‘

37:31.207 --> 37:34.495
J‘ On love .l‘

37:34.544 --> 37:37.786
J‘ On love .l‘

37:39.424 --> 37:42.882
Three. Three members
of our B&E gang locked up,

37:42.927 --> 37:44.133
and it's only Friday.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.510
(Oliver) Hey, hey, hey.
Look who it is. Look who it is.

37:45.555 --> 37:46.965
It's the one-hit wonder. (laughs)

37:48.975 --> 37:50.215
No, l'm--| shouldn't interrupt.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.884
You guys are probably
gonna have a threesome.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.313
(Oliver laughs)

37:56.608 --> 37:58.314
- So what are you gonna do?
- What can I do?

37:58.359 --> 38:00.315
It's gonna be all over the division
by tomorrow morning.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.898
No, I meant about Denise.
Are you still gonna propose?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.231
- Can we not talk about that?
- Don't do it, man.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.400
I know, okay. I'm young.
l have my whole life ahead of me.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.239
- We already talked about--
- No, it's--it's not that.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.574
If you get married,
then you're gonna have kids,

38:12.624 --> 38:14.205
and you're gonna split up,

38:14.250 --> 38:17.162
and your kids are gonna have to
go back and forth every weekend,

38:17.212 --> 38:18.998
living out of their knapsack.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.291
Divorce sucks.

38:24.969 --> 38:28.086
The word is that Diaz is on a--
is on a, uh, deadline.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.723
The man is not into comparison shopping.
I can respect that.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.633
Well, I can, too. But Timmins, huh?

38:34.395 --> 38:35.384
Hmm.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.814
(door squeaks)

38:39.609 --> 38:40.769
Wow.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.275
Indeed, indeed.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.232
(Gail)
What is wrong with you guys?

38:47.325 --> 38:48.781
Hey, guys.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.785
Oh, hey, Denise.
Let me introduce you.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.116
Uh, oh. (chuckles)

38:54.165 --> 38:55.871
I've heard so much about you.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.253
Uh, this is Dov.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.210
Uh, Denise...

39:05.260 --> 39:08.127
That's--that's Gail.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.760
- (crunching) Hi.
- Hi.

39:14.644 --> 39:15.804
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.391
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

39:18.606 --> 39:19.721
Uh, have you seen Andy?

39:19.983 --> 39:22.269
- Yeah, she's right...
- She--okay.

39:23.027 --> 39:24.437
- What's his name?
- What?

39:25.196 --> 39:27.528
Your son.
H-he's a good-looking kid.

39:27.574 --> 39:28.939
What--what's--what's his name?

39:30.159 --> 39:31.194
Leo.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.202
Leo. Huh. Well, that's funny,
because I'm a Leo.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.821
(clears throat)

39:36.875 --> 39:39.833
You know, |--| like kids. L-love them.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.995
|--| like the, urn, the zoo, you know?

39:43.047 --> 39:45.629
And I like, um...

39:45.675 --> 39:46.755
you know?

39:48.511 --> 39:49.626
Great.

39:50.513 --> 39:52.049
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

39:55.768 --> 39:56.974
(mouths words)

39:57.020 --> 39:58.226
(laughs)

40:00.148 --> 40:01.183
Hi.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.480
Hey.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.478
You want a drink?

40:05.528 --> 40:07.689
No, no, |--| can't. I got Leo tonight.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.149
Uh, ljust...

40:10.617 --> 40:12.983
ljust-- I wanted to thank you

40:13.036 --> 40:15.277
for going back in and talking to Boyko.

40:16.915 --> 40:17.904
(whispers) Yeah.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.993
I should never have left you alone.

40:20.043 --> 40:23.501
(sighs)
I told you to go. It's fine.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.084
you always end up dropping the ball.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.472
Trace, you didn't drop the ball.

40:34.599 --> 40:37.011
You were there for your kid.
I mean, that's the most important thing.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.434
You think it gets any easier?

40:40.480 --> 40:43.438
(sighs)

40:43.483 --> 40:45.565
l have no idea.
