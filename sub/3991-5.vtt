WEBVTT

00:03.230 --> 00:04.697
- Previously on Hannibal.
- Layers and layers of lies

00:04.730 --> 00:07.494
betrayed by the sad glint
in a child's eyes.

00:07.540 --> 00:11.636
- How did you feel
seeing Marissa Schuur
impaled in his antler room?

00:11.670 --> 00:14.309
- Guilty.
- Because you couldn't save her?

00:14.340 --> 00:16.547
- Because I felt
like I killed her.

00:16.580 --> 00:19.469
- Our friend Will seems
haunted today.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.411
- We don't know what nightmares
lie coiled beneath
Will's pillow.

00:23.450 --> 00:26.658
- At night, I leave the lights
on in my little house

00:26.690 --> 00:29.784
and walk across the flat fields.
When I look back

00:29.830 --> 00:32.628
from a distance, the house is
like a boat on the sea.

00:32.660 --> 00:35.458
It's really the only time
I feel safe.

00:35.500 --> 00:39.061
- Children transport us
to our childhoods.
- What do you see, Will?

00:39.100 --> 00:43.161
- Will may feel the tug of life
before the FBI, before you.
He needs an anchor, Jack.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.429
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go home.

01:40.930 --> 01:42.727
(siren)

01:51.440 --> 01:54.739
- You lost?

01:54.780 --> 01:57.248
- Uh, what?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.612
- What's your name?

01:59.650 --> 02:03.381
- Will Graham.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.583
- Do you know where
you are, Mr. Graham?

02:06.620 --> 02:09.623
- No.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.254
- Where do you live?

02:12.300 --> 02:16.191
- Wolf Trap, Virginia.

02:16.230 --> 02:19.893
- We're in Wolf Trap, so that's
good. You're close to home.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.306
Is that yours?

02:25.770 --> 02:27.738
- Aw, hi, Winston.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.748
Hey--

02:29.780 --> 02:32.248
Uh, can I sit down?
My feet are sore.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.477
- Why don't we take you home?

02:35.520 --> 02:38.887
- OK.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.411
- Are you on any drugs?
Medication?

02:41.460 --> 02:43.428
Prescription or otherwise?
- No.

02:43.460 --> 02:44.825
- You been drinkin'?

02:44.860 --> 02:47.829
- No. Uh, yes.
Not excessively.

02:47.860 --> 02:50.465
I had two fingers of whiskey
before I went to bed.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.630
- You have a history
of sleepwalking, Mr. Graham?

02:54.670 --> 02:58.800
-_I'm not even sure
If I'm awake now.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.388
- Although I may be,
is it safe

03:14.420 --> 03:18.254
to assume you're
not sleepwalking now?
- I'm sorry it's so early.

03:18.290 --> 03:21.521
- Never apologize
for coming to me.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.768
Office hours are for patients.
My kitchen is always
open to friends.

03:28.970 --> 03:32.474
Onset of sleepwalking
in adulthood

03:32.510 --> 03:35.707
is less common than in children.
- Could It be a seizure?

03:37.710 --> 03:40.577
- I'd argue good old-fashioned
post-traumatic stress.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.815
Jack Crawford has gotten
your hands very dirty.

03:42.850 --> 03:46.684
- I wasn't forced
back into the field.
- I wouldn't say "forced".

03:46.720 --> 03:49.450
"Manipulated" would be
the word I'd choose.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.788
- I can handle it.

03:51.830 --> 03:54.424
- Somewhere between
denying horrible events

03:54.460 --> 03:56.963
and calling them out lies the
truth of psychological trauma.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.491
- So I can't handle it.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.565
- Your experience may have
overwhelmed ordinary functions

04:01.600 --> 04:03.568
that give you
a sense of control.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.579
- If my body is walking around
without my permission,

04:06.610 --> 04:08.976
you'd say that's
a loss of control?

04:09.010 --> 04:12.878
- Wouldn't you?

04:19.620 --> 04:21.679
Sleepwalkers demonstrate
a difficulty

04:21.720 --> 04:24.985
handling aggression.
Are you experiencing

04:25.030 --> 04:28.454
difficulty with
aggressive feelings?

04:28.500 --> 04:31.628
- You said Jack _sees me
as fine china

04:31.670 --> 04:35.458
used for special guests.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.367
I'm beginning to feel
more like an old mug.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.406
- You entered into a devil's
bargain with Jack Crawford.
It takes a toll.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.817
- Jack isn't the devil.

04:46.850 --> 04:50.911
- When it _comes to how far
he's Willing to push you
to get what he wants,

04:50.950 --> 04:53.919
he's certainly no saint.

05:35.730 --> 05:38.722
***

06:01.560 --> 06:05.451
- Room was registered to a John
Smith. Heh, big surprise there.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.697
- An appalling failure
of imagination.

06:07.730 --> 06:10.699
- They paid cash.
There are no security cameras

06:10.730 --> 06:12.698
on the premises--
another big surprise.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.834
- John Smith one of the victims?
- Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,

06:15.870 --> 06:18.600
according to the register.
Mutilated and displayed.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.608
I thought it might be
the Chesapeake Ripper, but

06:20.640 --> 06:23.473
there were no surgical trophies
taken. I'm gonna need you

06:23.510 --> 06:25.774
to prepare yourself on this one.
- I'm prepared.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.778
- Prepare yourself some more.
It's soup in there.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.584
- Soup isn't good for the soul.
- Not this kind.

06:30.620 --> 06:33.180
Alright, look, there are no
jurisdictional rivalries here.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.678
The local police begged us
to take this. Where's your head?

06:36.730 --> 06:40.427
- It's on my pillow.
I didn't sleep.

06:40.460 --> 06:43.497
- Got just the thing
to wake you up.

07:04.220 --> 07:06.859
- OK, I'm awake.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.694
- Hooks were bored
into the ceiling.

07:12.730 --> 07:14.493
Fishing line was used

07:14.530 --> 07:17.920
to hold up the bodies
and... the wings.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.791
- At least we know
he's a fisherman.
- And/or a Viking.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.035
- Vikings do this?

07:23.070 --> 07:26.528
- Vikings used to execute
Christians by breaking
their ribs,

07:26.580 --> 07:28.639
bending them back, and
draping the lungs over them

07:28.680 --> 07:31.899
to resemble wings. They used
to call it a "blood eagle."

07:31.950 --> 07:34.874
- Pagans mocking
the god-fearing?

07:34.920 --> 07:38.913
- Then who's mocking who?
- No, he isn't mocking them.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.817
He's transforming them.
- I don't know if it was

07:41.860 --> 07:44.055
the good night's sleep,
but he slept here.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.593
Hair on the pillow
and the sheets are still damp.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.723
He's a sweater.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.899
- Madness slept here
last night.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.068
- He threw up
on the nightstand.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.933
- Couldn't stomach
what he did.

07:57.970 --> 07:59.938
Flop sweat and
nervous indigestion.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.039
- Not nervous.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.575
Righteous.

08:06.620 --> 08:10.249
Thinks he's...
elevating them somehow.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.854
I need a plastic sheet
for the bed.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.964
This is not who you are.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.801
This is my gift to you.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.917
I allow you to become angels.

09:19.890 --> 09:21.881
And now,

09:21.920 --> 09:24.650
I lay me down to sleep.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.596
(classical music playing)

09:52.690 --> 09:54.783
- A masterpiece
foie gras au torchon

09:54.820 --> 09:57.254
with a late harvest

09:57.290 --> 09:59.155
of Vidal sauce...

10:01.160 --> 10:04.027
...with dried and fresh figs.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.322
- Wonderful.

10:06.370 --> 10:08.338
- Mrs. Crawford,
your husband

10:08.370 --> 10:11.362
introduced you as Bella. Are you
an Isabelle or an Annabelle?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.674
- I'm a Phyllis.

10:13.710 --> 10:18.147
Jack only calls me Phyllis
when we disagree.

10:18.180 --> 10:22.014
- So, named Bella
for your beauty.

10:22.050 --> 10:25.110
- We were both stationed
in Italy. I was army,
she was NATO staff.

10:25.150 --> 10:27.687
All of the Italian men
kept calling her

10:27.720 --> 10:29.688
"bella, bella, bella."

10:29.730 --> 10:32.051
Well, I wanted her
to be my bella.

10:35.730 --> 10:38.961
Mm. Cold foie gras

10:39.000 --> 10:41.969
with warm figs.
- Yes.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.763
- Very nice.

10:43.810 --> 10:47.109
- Would I be a horrible guest
if I skipped this course?

10:47.140 --> 10:49.176
- Too rich?
- Too cruel.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.700
- Phyllis.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.877
- Jack.
- First and worst sign

10:52.920 --> 10:55.912
of sociopathic behavior:
cruelty to animals.

10:55.950 --> 10:59.317
- That doesn't apply
in the kitchen.

10:59.350 --> 11:01.181
- I have no taste
for animal cruelty,

11:01.220 --> 11:04.018
which is why I employ
an ethical butcher.

11:04.060 --> 11:07.757
- An ethical butcher? Be kind
to animals and then eat them?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.724
- I'm afraid I insist on it.

11:10.770 --> 11:14.399
No need for unnecessary
suffering.

11:20.780 --> 11:24.409
Human emotions are a gift
from our animal ancestors.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.406
Cruelty is a gift

11:26.450 --> 11:29.010
humanity has given itself.

11:29.050 --> 11:32.178
- The gift that
keeps on giving.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.929
(inhaling)

11:38.960 --> 11:42.498
- Your perfume is exquisite.

11:42.530 --> 11:46.159
Similar to the aroma
on the earth just after
lightning strikes.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.294
Is it Jar?

11:49.340 --> 11:51.934
- That is some nose
you have there, Doctor.

11:51.970 --> 11:54.370
- He's quite
the charmer.

11:54.410 --> 11:56.503
- I first noticed
my keen sense of smell

11:56.540 --> 11:58.872
when I was a young man.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.743
I was aware one of my teachers
had stomach cancer

12:01.780 --> 12:04.783
even before he was.
- Hm.

12:04.820 --> 12:07.050
Wow, that must have been
some parlor trick.

12:07.090 --> 12:10.787
- For our next course,

12:10.830 --> 12:14.095
roasted pork shank.
And I assure you, Bella,

12:14.130 --> 12:17.497
it was an especially
supercilious pig.

12:26.540 --> 12:29.475
- "Death makes angels
of us all and gives us wings

12:29.510 --> 12:31.842
where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's claws."

12:31.880 --> 12:35.816
- Robert Frost.
- Jim Morrison.

12:35.850 --> 12:38.819
- Even a drunk with
a flair for the dramatic

12:38.850 --> 12:42.217
can convince himself he's God.
Or the Lizard King.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.821
- God makes angels. Jesus was
fond of fishermen.

12:45.860 --> 12:49.296
Are we talking hardcore
Judeo-Christian upsetting,
or just upsetting in general?

12:49.330 --> 12:51.389
- This is a very
specific upsetting.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.364
- Increased serotonin
In the wounds

12:53.400 --> 12:56.233
is much higher than
the free histamines, so, uh,

12:56.270 --> 12:59.876
she lived for about 15 minutes
after she was skinned.

12:59.910 --> 13:02.208
- Powder residue on
the neck of the soda bottle

13:02.240 --> 13:04.299
shows Vecuronium--

13:04.350 --> 13:07.274
scotch and_ soda
and a paralytic agent.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.118
- Kneeling in supplication
at the feet of G-dash-D.

13:10.150 --> 13:12.983
- Supplication is the most
common form of prayer.

13:13.020 --> 13:16.057
Gimme,
gimme, gimme.

13:16.090 --> 13:18.524
- They weren't praying to him.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.290
They were praying for him.

13:24.030 --> 13:27.397
He's afraid.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.034
- What is somebody who
could do something like this

13:30.070 --> 13:32.300
afraid of?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.273
- What's in his vomit?
- Uh, dexamethasone...

13:39.250 --> 13:42.071
...Keppra...
- He was epileptic. Radiation?

13:42.120 --> 13:44.941
- Gamma four.
- Steroids for the inflammation,

13:44.990 --> 13:48.153
anticonvulsants for
the seizures, radiation
for the chemotherapy.

13:48.190 --> 13:50.329
Our guy has a brain tumor.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.196
- He's afraid of dying
in his sleep.

13:58.270 --> 14:02.263
He's making angels
to watch over him.

14:09.180 --> 14:12.377
- Mrs. Crawford.

14:12.410 --> 14:15.618
Please come in.

14:18.620 --> 14:20.212
How often do you see him?

14:20.260 --> 14:22.581
- Twice a week at first.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.588
Now usually just once.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.053
- You're satisfied, then?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.056
- Enough to keep seeing him.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.523
- Your intention is
not to tell Jack.

14:31.570 --> 14:36.337
- I don't see what good
it would do.

14:36.370 --> 14:39.635
Jack sees the world
at Its worst.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.207
Don't need him
seeing me at mine.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.447
He already has
too much to worry about.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.313
- He has room
for one more worry.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.288
I feel like
you're protecting him.

14:52.320 --> 14:56.086
- I am. I've had dinner

14:56.120 --> 14:58.452
at your home.

14:58.490 --> 15:01.288
You have a professional
relationship with my husband.

15:01.330 --> 15:04.424
There's no conflict of interest,
me being here?

15:04.470 --> 15:06.426
- It's unorthodox,

15:06.470 --> 15:09.234
but not unheard of.

15:09.270 --> 15:12.103
Given the nature of your
problem, seeing someone
who knows Jack

15:12.140 --> 15:13.937
removes some
of the guesswork.

15:18.010 --> 15:21.673
- This all started
as some misguided stab

15:21.720 --> 15:24.416
at maintaining my dignity.

15:24.450 --> 15:27.317
- Nothing undignified
about this.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.510
- Not yet.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.222
But I have indignity

15:32.260 --> 15:34.296
to look forward to, don't I?

15:34.330 --> 15:37.458
- The only indignity
I see is resentment.

15:39.570 --> 15:42.391
Why do you resent
your husband?

15:44.740 --> 15:48.471
- I resent that Jack...

15:48.510 --> 15:51.104
has too much to worry about

15:51.150 --> 15:53.618
to worry about me.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.675
- But that's your choice.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.745
Not his.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.487
- Then maybe you should see us
both for couples counseling.

16:01.520 --> 16:05.149
- I would_ recommend another
psychiatrist for couples.

16:05.190 --> 16:09.422
I wouldn't want you to have
the home-couch advantage.

16:09.460 --> 16:11.690
- It's hard enough

16:11.730 --> 16:14.494
dealing with how I feel
about all of this.

16:14.540 --> 16:17.600
Don't need to deal with
how Jack feels about it.

16:23.350 --> 16:27.172
- There is no one and only
spiritual center of the brain.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.087
Any idea of God comes from many
different areas of the mind

16:30.120 --> 16:32.315
working together
in unison.

16:32.350 --> 16:34.318
- Maybe I was wrong.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.488
How do you profile
someone who has

16:37.530 --> 16:40.522
an anomaly in their head
changing the way they think?

16:40.560 --> 16:44.189
- A tumor can definitely
affect brain function,

16:44.230 --> 16:47.336
even cause vivid hallucinations.
However, what appears

16:47.370 --> 16:50.737
to be driving your Angel Maker
to create heaven on earth

16:50.770 --> 16:54.604
is a simple issue of mortality.
- Can't beat God, become him?

16:54.640 --> 16:58.508
- You said he was afraid.

16:58.550 --> 17:01.678
- He feels abandoned.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.346
- Ever feel abandoned, Will?

17:06.390 --> 17:09.689
- Abandonment requires
expectation.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.099
- What were you expectations

17:13.130 --> 17:16.497
of Jack Crawford
and the FBI?

17:16.530 --> 17:18.498
- Jack hasn't abandoned me.

17:18.530 --> 17:21.237
- Not in any discernible way.

17:21.270 --> 17:24.569
Perhaps in the way gods
abandon their creations.

17:24.610 --> 17:26.805
You say he hasn't abandoned you,
but at the same time

17:26.840 --> 17:30.378
you find yourself
wandering around Wolf Trap
in the middle of the night.

17:30.410 --> 17:34.369
- Well...
(chuckling)
This should be interesting.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.514
Please, Doctor, proceed.

17:37.550 --> 17:41.589
- Jack gave you his word
he would protect your headspace,

17:41.620 --> 17:44.384
yet he leaves you
to your mental devices.

17:44.430 --> 17:48.651
- Are you trying to alienate me
from Jack Crawford?

17:48.700 --> 17:53.194
- I'm trying to help you
understand this Angel Maker

17:53.240 --> 17:55.196
you seek.
- Well, help me understand

17:55.240 --> 17:57.800
how to catch him.
- If he were a classic paranoid

17:57.840 --> 18:01.435
schizophrenic, you might be able
to influence him

18:01.480 --> 18:04.347
to become visible.
- What, scare him out
into the daylight?

18:04.380 --> 18:07.315
- Might even get him
to hurt himself,

18:07.350 --> 18:09.477
if he hasn't already.
- If he were self-destructive,

18:09.520 --> 18:11.613
he-he-he wouldn't be so careful.

18:11.650 --> 18:15.416
- Unless he's careful _
about being self-destructive,

18:15.460 --> 18:19.851
making angels to pray over him
when he sleeps.

18:23.670 --> 18:27.128
Who prays over us when we sleep?

18:31.940 --> 18:35.478
- So, do you wait until you
think I'm asleep before
you come to bed?

18:35.510 --> 18:37.478
- It's not intentional.

18:37.510 --> 18:39.307
I'm working late.

18:39.350 --> 18:43.184
Nothing personal.

18:43.220 --> 18:47.611
- So can we have a conversation,
or do you want to pretend that
everything's alright?

18:47.660 --> 18:51.187
- Everything is alright.

18:51.230 --> 18:54.222
- So no conversation.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.664
- I'm a bit overwhelmed
at the moment.

18:58.700 --> 19:02.466
- With?
- With things at work...

19:02.500 --> 19:04.661
etcete ra .

19:04.710 --> 19:08.578
I've got some things
I have to sort through.

19:08.610 --> 19:11.738
It's, uh, outside
your jurisdiction, Jack.

19:11.780 --> 19:14.749
- You know something...

19:14.780 --> 19:17.613
I'm very good
at sorting things out,

19:17.650 --> 19:19.789
and at the very least
I can underwhelm you

19:19.820 --> 19:24.359
while you're being overwhelmed.
- You've never been able
to underwhelm me.

19:24.390 --> 19:29.794
- Is there anything I can offer
you romantically or physically
or spiritually that'll help?

19:29.830 --> 19:31.923
- Nope.

19:31.970 --> 19:36.760
- So as your husband,
what I can do for you is, um,

19:36.800 --> 19:39.928
leave you alone and not ask you
any questions.

19:42.410 --> 19:45.299
- You can ask me anything
you want to.

19:47.550 --> 19:50.815
- I won't insult you by asking
if there's someone else.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.510
- Thank you.

19:55.560 --> 20:00.953
- You'll sort out whatever it is
you have to sort out, we'll get
back to being us.

20:03.730 --> 20:05.823
I love you, Bella.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.631
- I love you too.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.946
- Why angels?

20:59.990 --> 21:03.323
- Well, it isn't biblical.
His angels have wings.

21:03.360 --> 21:07.820
Um, angels in sculptures
and paintings can fly,
but not in Scripture.

21:07.860 --> 21:10.328
- He's drawing
from secular sources?

21:10.370 --> 21:14.488
- H_is mind has turned
against him and there's
no one there to help.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.690
- Uh, Jack, look at this.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.402
- Are those...
What are those?

21:19.440 --> 21:23.672
- Somebody got an orchiectomy
real cheap.

21:23.710 --> 21:27.077
- Doesn't look like the victim.
- So they're the Angel Maker's?

21:27.110 --> 21:29.817
- He castrated himself?
- So he isn't just

21:29.850 --> 21:31.989
making angels; he's getting
ready to become one.

21:32.020 --> 21:35.478
Angels don't have genitalia.

21:37.490 --> 21:40.459
- So he was afraid of dying.
Now he's, what, getting used
to the idea?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.957
- He's accepting it
or he's bargaining.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.367
- Heh, bargaining chips!
- So, does this mean that

21:46.400 --> 21:48.095
he's done making angels,
or is he just getting started?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.461
- I don't know.
- Well, he's not just

21:50.510 --> 21:52.728
killing them when he's sleepy.
I mean, how is he choosing them?

21:52.770 --> 21:54.738
- I don't know. Ask him.
- I'm asking you.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.374
- You're the head of the
Behavioral Science Unit, Jack.

21:57.410 --> 22:01.517
Why don't you come up
with your own answers
if you don't like mine?

22:03.520 --> 22:05.715
- I did not hear that!

22:05.750 --> 22:08.878
Did I?

22:08.920 --> 22:10.524
- Um...

22:13.530 --> 22:16.021
No, you didn't.

22:16.060 --> 22:17.664
I'm sorry.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.499
- I've never heard anybody talk
to Jack the way you talked
to Jack.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.929
- I was out of line. _
- You were out of your mind.

22:58.970 --> 23:02.906
My ears rang like the first time
I heard my mom use the F-word.

23:02.940 --> 23:06.501
(He chuckles.)
You OK?

23:06.550 --> 23:09.144
I know it's a stupid question
considering that none of us

23:09.180 --> 23:14.186
could possibly be OK doing what
we do, but... are you OK?

23:14.220 --> 23:17.428
- Do I seem different?

23:17.460 --> 23:19.678
- You're a little different,

23:19.730 --> 23:21.948
but you've always been
a little different.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.922
Brilliant strategy--

23:23.970 --> 23:26.063
that way no one ever knows
if something's up with you.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.136
- How would I know if something
was up with you?

23:28.170 --> 23:30.468
- You wouldn't.

23:30.510 --> 23:35.209
But I would tell you if you
asked me. Return the favor?

23:35.240 --> 23:39.142
- Meet Roger
and Marilyn Brunner.

23:39.180 --> 23:42.149
You might recognize them
from such lists as Most Wanted.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.887
He likes to rape and murder,
she likes to watch.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.138
We got a DNA match.
They falsified

23:47.190 --> 23:49.886
the motel registry
and were driving a stolen car,

23:49.920 --> 23:51.888
so it took a second
to identify them.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.990
- I wonder how long it took
Angel Maker to identify them.

23:55.030 --> 23:58.818
He didn't choose them randomly.
- He knows something about them.

23:58.870 --> 24:02.567
The murdered security guard
wasn't actually a security
guard.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.706
- Could Angel Maker be
a vigilante?

24:05.740 --> 24:10.575
- Well, vigilantes are
pragmatic, they're purposeful;

24:10.610 --> 24:14.011
they don't lay down and sleep
under their crimes.

24:16.020 --> 24:20.184
In his mind,
he was doing God's work.
- That spells vigilante.

24:20.220 --> 24:23.724
- Well, playing at God has
other advantages. One of them...

24:23.760 --> 24:27.753
is always being alone.
- So he makes angels
out of demons.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.688
- How does he know
they're demons?

24:29.730 --> 24:32.198
- He doesn't have to know.

24:32.230 --> 24:34.698
All he has to do is believe.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.073
- Has Jack begun
to suspect?

24:43.110 --> 24:45.578
He's a behavioral specialist.
He must know

24:45.610 --> 24:47.578
you are keeping something
from him.

24:47.620 --> 24:52.182
- Oh, he knows. He asked me
ifI was having an affair--

24:52.220 --> 24:55.610
by reassuring me
that he didn't have to ask.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.151
- I doubt he believes
you're unfaithful.

24:58.190 --> 25:00.078
- And why do you doubt that?

25:00.130 --> 25:02.951
- It's clear you love
your husband.

25:03.000 --> 25:07.562
- Women who love their husbands
still find reasons to cheat
on them.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.104
- Not you.

25:11.140 --> 25:14.598
Still, you seem more betrayed
by Jack than by your own body.

25:16.610 --> 25:19.704
- I don't feel betrayed
by Jack.

25:19.750 --> 25:23.242
And there's no point in being
mad at cancer for being cancer.

25:23.280 --> 25:24.838
- Sure there is.

25:24.890 --> 25:27.711
- Cancer isn't cruel.

25:27.760 --> 25:31.821
Tiny cell wanders off
from my liver, gets lost,

25:31.860 --> 25:33.828
finds its way into my lung,

25:33.860 --> 25:36.829
where it's just trying
to do its job and...

25:36.860 --> 25:38.999
grow a liver.

25:39.030 --> 25:43.603
- What it grows and where it's
growing it will likely kill you.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.961
- Not likely.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.570
It WILL kill me,

25:48.610 --> 25:53.741
And no amount of blueberries
or antioxidants can
change that now.

25:53.780 --> 25:57.079
- But you hold Jack accountable
for his inability
to cure cancer.

25:59.650 --> 26:01.959
Should I have said
his inability to save you?

26:01.990 --> 26:07.997
Would that be more accurate?
- I am slowly shrinking,

26:08.030 --> 26:11.864
while this tiny thing grows
larger every day.

26:13.870 --> 26:16.293
And yet I feel fine.

26:16.340 --> 26:19.161
- You will feel fine--

26:19.210 --> 26:21.770
up until the precise moment
you don't.

26:21.810 --> 26:27.271
- It's a... really very
dull story, though, isn't it?

26:27.310 --> 26:32.782
The ending is always the same,
and that same is that it ends.

26:32.820 --> 26:37.052
- So, you withdraw

26:37.090 --> 26:40.184
from your relationship
with your husband,

26:40.230 --> 26:42.858
the man who strolled along
the quays of Livorno, Italy,

26:42.900 --> 26:45.368
and called you Bella.

27:32.450 --> 27:35.647
(dogs barking)

28:04.050 --> 28:06.769
- It's difficult to lie still
and fear going to sleep

28:06.810 --> 28:09.745
when it's there
to think about.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.987
You listen to your breathing
in the dark

28:12.020 --> 28:14.454
and the tiny clicks
of your blinking eyes.

28:14.490 --> 28:17.118
- I dream more now
than I used to.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.082
- Well, your dreams were
the one place you could be

28:19.130 --> 28:22.497
physically safe, relinquishing
control. Not anymore.

28:22.530 --> 28:25.124
- Yeah, I thought about zipping
myself up into a sleeping bag

28:25.170 --> 28:27.320
before I go to sleep,
but it, heh,

28:27.370 --> 28:30.066
sounds like a poor man's
straightjacket.

28:32.070 --> 28:35.733
- Have you determined how this
Angel Maker is choosing
his victims?

28:35.780 --> 28:39.876
- Well, he doesn't see people
how everyone else sees them.

28:39.910 --> 28:43.073
He can tell if you're naughty
or nice,

28:43.120 --> 28:45.111
or he thinks he can.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.283
- So God has given this person
insight into the souls of men.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.050
- God didn't give him insight;
God gave him a tumor.

28:53.090 --> 28:59.063
He's just a man whose brain is
playing tricks on him.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.038
- You are not unlike
this killer.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.300
- My brain is playing tricks
on me?

29:05.340 --> 29:09.037
- You want to feel such sweet
and easy peace.

29:09.080 --> 29:11.048
The Angel Maker wants
that same peace.

29:11.080 --> 29:14.470
He hopes to feel his way
cautiously inside and then find

29:14.520 --> 29:16.909
it's endless, all around him.

29:16.950 --> 29:19.180
- He's gonna be disappointed.

29:19.220 --> 29:21.313
- You accept the impossibility
of such a feeling,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.783
whereas the Angel Maker is
still chasing it.

29:23.830 --> 29:27.357
If he got close to it,
that's why he will

29:27.390 --> 29:32.259
look for it again.
_- I've tried to reconstruct
hIS thinking, find hIS patterns.

29:32.300 --> 29:37.533
- Instead you find yourself
in a behavior pattern
you can't break.

29:37.570 --> 29:40.130
You realize_
you have a ch0|ce.

29:40.170 --> 29:42.138
- What is it?

29:42.180 --> 29:47.004
- Angel Maker will be destroyed
by what's happening
inside his head;

29:47.050 --> 29:49.041
you don't have to be.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.886
- Did you just smell me?

29:59.930 --> 30:02.899
- Difficult to avoid.

30:02.930 --> 30:05.421
I really must introduce you
to a finer aftershave.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.030
That smells like something
with a ship on the bottle.

30:08.070 --> 30:10.197
- Well, I keep getting it
for Christmas.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.906
- Have your headaches been
any worse lately? More frequent?

30:14.940 --> 30:16.134
- Yes, actually.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.805
- I'd change the aftershave.

30:26.550 --> 30:29.110
- Elliot Budish: 35-year-old
truck driver.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.459
He's got a fishing license too.
Uh, match came from the National
Cancer Database.

30:32.490 --> 30:35.527
Married, two kids--they haven't
seen him in four months.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.869
He was diagnosed
five months ago.

30:37.900 --> 30:39.891
- Meet the Angel Maker.

30:42.300 --> 30:45.406
Have you heard from him
since he left?

30:45.440 --> 30:47.408
- I left him.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.408
And, uh, no, no,

30:49.440 --> 30:51.408
I haven't.

30:51.450 --> 30:54.044
- Why did you leave?

30:56.050 --> 30:58.018
- Because of his cancer.

30:58.050 --> 31:00.917
It makes me sound
like a horrible wife.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.485
- I'm sure you had
your reasons.

31:03.520 --> 31:08.651
- I took a leave from work
to, uh, to be with him.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.066
I wanted to be there
for him.

31:11.100 --> 31:14.365
But what he wanted was
to be alone.

31:14.400 --> 31:17.096
He just kept pulling away

31:17.140 --> 31:20.132
and pulling away.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.309
He made it clear
he didn't want me there.

31:24.310 --> 31:26.301
And then it wasn't clear.

31:28.320 --> 31:31.312
And then it didn't matter why
he was acting the way he was.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.516
It was weird

31:37.560 --> 31:41.223
for the kids.
I mean,

31:41.260 --> 31:43.626
what kind of mother exposes
her children to someone

31:43.660 --> 31:45.662
who is losing their mind?

31:50.970 --> 31:53.973
- Was he ever violent,
Mrs. Budish?

31:55.980 --> 31:59.177
- He was angry.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.019
But he never

32:01.050 --> 32:03.314
hit me or the boys.

32:03.350 --> 32:06.046
It was hardest on them

32:06.090 --> 32:08.558
to see him slip away.

32:08.590 --> 32:12.356
He lost himself,
and they lost a father.

32:12.390 --> 32:16.121
I thought that
as he got weaker,

32:16.160 --> 32:20.369
as the cancer got worse,
that it would be less confusing

32:20.400 --> 32:24.166
for them.
They could just see him

32:24.210 --> 32:27.099
as a sick man

32:27.140 --> 32:30.268
instead of someone
who was so terrified.

32:30.310 --> 32:35.145
- And, uh, did your husband's
faith falter

32:35.180 --> 32:37.239
after he was told
about the cancer?

32:37.280 --> 32:41.979
- Elliot wasn't
ever religious.

32:42.020 --> 32:45.421
Is he doing
something religious?
- He may believe he is.

32:45.460 --> 32:48.657
- Your husband is dying,

32:48.700 --> 32:52.522
Mrs. Budish,
and soon.

32:52.570 --> 32:55.459
We'd just like

32:55.500 --> 32:59.561
to... we'd like to find him
before he hurts himself
or anyone else.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.332
- H-He had

33:03.380 --> 33:07.339
a near-death experience.
He suffocated

33:07.380 --> 33:09.439
Maﬁm
when he was a little boy.

33:11.450 --> 33:14.419
Fireman said he must've had
a guardian angel.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.416
- Where did this happen?

33:16.460 --> 33:19.679
- Um... a farm...

33:19.730 --> 33:22.198
where he grew up.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.809
- This'll be the last one.
- It's Budish?

34:16.850 --> 34:19.512
- He made himself
into an angel.

34:25.590 --> 34:29.629
It wasn't God, it wasn't man.
It was his choice to die.

34:29.660 --> 34:32.458
- His choice?
- As much as he can make it.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.099
I don't know how much longer
I can be all that useful
to you, Jack.

34:45.150 --> 34:48.119
- Really? You caught three.
The last three we had,

34:48.150 --> 34:50.118
you caught.
You caught three of them.

34:50.150 --> 34:54.450
- No, I didn't catch this one.
Elliot Budish... surrendered.

34:54.490 --> 34:57.584
- You know, I'm used to my wife
not talking to me.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.850
I don't have to get used to you
not talking to me too.

34:59.890 --> 35:03.656
- It's getting harder and harder
to make myself look.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.123
- Well, nobody's asking you
to look alone.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.138
- But I am looking alone.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.138
And you know what
looking at this does.

35:10.170 --> 35:12.365
- I know what happens
if you don't look,

35:12.410 --> 35:16.870
and so do you.
- I can make myself look, but
the thinking is shutting down.

35:16.910 --> 35:20.175
- What is it about this one?
- It isn't this one.

35:20.210 --> 35:23.441
It's all of them. It's the next
one, it's the one that I know
is coming after that.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.448
- You wanna go back
to your lecture hall?

35:25.490 --> 35:28.584
Read about this stuff
on Tattlecrime.com?
- No, I don't.

35:28.620 --> 35:31.680
But that may be what I have
to do. This is bad for me.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.686
- I'm not your father, Will.

35:33.730 --> 35:36.722
I'm not gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.127
- Seems like that's exactly
what you're gonna do.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.706
- You go back
to your classroom.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.300
When there's killing going on
that you could've prevented,

35:47.340 --> 35:49.604
it will sour your classroom
forever.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.576
- Maybe. And then maybe
I'll find a job

35:53.610 --> 35:56.170
as a diesel mechanic
in a boatyard.

35:56.220 --> 35:59.712
- You wanna quit?

35:59.750 --> 36:01.354
Quit.

36:29.850 --> 36:32.944
- I see what you are.

36:32.990 --> 36:35.618
- What do you see?

36:35.660 --> 36:37.912
- Inside.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.520
I can bring it out of you.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.596
- Not all the way out.

36:42.630 --> 36:45.292
(cough)

36:47.300 --> 36:50.497
- I can give you...
the majesty

36:50.540 --> 36:53.509
of true becoming.

37:14.430 --> 37:15.795
- Hello, Doctor.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.889
My wife and I need
to talk.

37:17.930 --> 37:21.798
May we use your waiting room?
- You can have the office.
Please.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.569
- Thank you.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.766
- Just popping in

37:27.810 --> 37:31.906
on official business,
or did you follow me?

37:31.950 --> 37:34.510
- I called your office.
They said you were

37:34.550 --> 37:38.247
at an appointment.
I figured you'd be here.

37:40.050 --> 37:42.689
- You know.

37:42.720 --> 37:46.451
I knew you'd find out.

37:46.490 --> 37:49.698
- When did you find out?

37:49.730 --> 37:51.698
- Twelve weeks ago.

37:51.730 --> 37:53.618
- Twelve weeks ago?

37:55.640 --> 37:57.562
- Lung cancer.

38:02.610 --> 38:04.578
- You don't smoke.

38:04.610 --> 38:06.749
- The irony.

38:08.850 --> 38:10.579
- Is it treatable?

38:12.590 --> 38:14.717
It's stage four.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.848
And we know there's
no stage five, don't we?

38:21.860 --> 38:24.397
- When were you
gonna tell me?

38:27.470 --> 38:31.759
- Far enough into the future
that I'm really not prepared
to have this conversation

38:31.810 --> 38:33.766
right now.
- Neither am I,

38:33.810 --> 38:36.370
but we're having it.
We're having it right now.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.697
Were you just going to wait

38:59.730 --> 39:02.096
until you were in the middle
of chemotherapy?

39:02.140 --> 39:06.133
When you couldn't hide it
anymore?

39:06.170 --> 39:08.536
- I don't think I want
to do chemotherapy.

39:08.580 --> 39:09.933
- Well, do I have any say

39:09.980 --> 39:12.141
in this?
- No.

39:12.180 --> 39:14.375
No, you don't.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.580
- Do you want to be alone?

39:23.560 --> 39:25.528
I don't want you
to answer that.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.551
I want you to think
about your answer.

39:30.200 --> 39:34.432
I want you to know that I don't
want you to be alone,
not now and not ever.

39:34.470 --> 39:37.633
- We'll beat this
together?

39:37.670 --> 39:41.106
- No, it's your fight, baby,
but I'm in your corner.

39:41.140 --> 39:42.937
I'm not going anywhere.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.519
- I appreciate that, Jack.

39:48.550 --> 39:50.939
I do.

39:52.950 --> 39:55.157
But I'm not comforted
by it.

39:58.590 --> 40:01.559
I know that's what you need
and,and".

40:03.560 --> 40:05.699
...you need
to comfort me.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.998
But I can't give you
what you need.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.167
- Don't worry
about what I need.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.042
Why wouldn't you tell me?

40:22.520 --> 40:26.638
- I thought
ifI kept it to myself,
our lives wouldn't change.

40:32.190 --> 40:35.796
I didn't count on changing
as much as I did.

41:18.140 --> 41:20.631
- What do you want, Will?

41:36.290 --> 41:39.828
- I'm gonna sit here
until you're ready to talk.

41:41.830 --> 41:45.789
You don't have to say a word
until you're ready, but...

41:45.830 --> 41:48.833
I'm not going anywhere
until you do.
