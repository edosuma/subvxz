LUWEI WEIWEI

02:17.416 --> 02:21.458
CHANG'AN CITY

02:32.500 --> 02:33.958
Are you trying to run away?

03:17.125 --> 03:18.666
Weiwei, we're coming.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.458
-Are you kidding me?
-The connection is lost.

03:37.875 --> 03:38.916
Make way!

03:39.583 --> 03:41.041
Sorry, it's an emergency!

03:41.250 --> 03:45.083
DIEMENG WEIXING, ZHANTIANXIA,
ZHENSHUI WUXIANG

MENG DONGXING
LUWEI WEIWEI

04:00.125 --> 04:01.916
-Weiwei...
-Catch!

04:42.458 --> 04:43.958
A master from the Blue Sea Tide Clan

04:44.041 --> 04:45.958
has succeeded in arresting
the thief, Meng Dongxing.

04:46.208 --> 04:47.958
The imperial treasure is retrieved.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.166
-Draw your sword.
-What is he doing?

04:53.375 --> 04:55.125
Let me do it. I'm on a roll.

04:58.666 --> 04:59.541
ITEMS DROPPED

05:02.041 --> 05:04.416
A MYSTERIOUS KNIFE
A BIG BAG OF GOLD COINS

05:05.833 --> 05:08.458
Congrats! You've obtained
the Undefeated Sword of the East!

05:08.541 --> 05:09.500
This game's design...

05:09.583 --> 05:11.583
Why does it have things
that are against our three values?

05:11.666 --> 05:13.875
The three values?
We have the three values in a game?

05:14.583 --> 05:15.625
Stop laughing.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.875
-It's all because you were late.
-My name is Bei Weiwei.

05:17.958 --> 05:20.041
In Mengyou Jianghu,
I'm called Luwei Weiwei.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.083
Ranked seventh in the PvP rankings.

05:22.166 --> 05:23.541
Mengyou Jianghu, Tianshan Snow Pool.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.541
Attacked by other college's players.
I need backup!

05:25.625 --> 05:26.500
I need backup!

05:26.875 --> 05:28.083
-I'm coming!
-I'm coming!

05:28.583 --> 05:29.791
-I'm coming!
-I'm coming!

05:29.875 --> 05:31.041
Did you see that?

05:31.125 --> 05:31.958
Gosh!

05:32.125 --> 05:34.375
-Yixiao Naihe is coming to save me.
-Yixiao Naihe?

05:34.541 --> 05:35.666
Come and look! Hurry up!

05:35.750 --> 05:37.083
-Really?
-Come and see!

05:37.375 --> 05:39.208
-Come on.
-Well done.

05:40.208 --> 05:41.833
-He is so fast.
-This is too bad.

05:41.958 --> 05:43.458
-Hurry!
-Go!

05:43.541 --> 05:44.541
He killed another one.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.750
-So awesome!
-Come on!

05:47.833 --> 05:49.500
-Drop!
-Drop!

05:50.750 --> 05:51.916
This is Yixiao Naihe,

05:52.250 --> 05:54.083
a legendary player in Mengyou Jianghu.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.000
He is the best player
on the entire server.

05:56.416 --> 05:59.333
The distance between us is not
as close as we are in the rankings.

06:00.541 --> 06:02.375
Weiwei, come to Forget-Love Island.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.500
-I want a divorce.
-A divorce?

06:04.583 --> 06:06.333
PLAYER ZHENSHUI WUXIANG
HAS REQUESTED A DIVORCE.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.750
Weiwei, I'm sorry.
I hope you don't have any questions.

06:20.583 --> 06:21.666
None at all.

06:22.291 --> 06:24.791
I'll compensate you with a set
of fairy equipment for our divorce.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.083
DECLINE

06:31.625 --> 06:32.916
I don't need it.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.083
We got married only to fulfill quests.

06:35.291 --> 06:36.916
Let's go and drink Forget-Love Potion.

06:38.208 --> 06:40.750
This is Zhenshui Wuxiang,
my in-game husband.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.916
We don't know each other in reality.

06:48.958 --> 06:53.166
Zhenshui Wuxiang and Luwei Weiwei
got a divorce.

06:53.250 --> 06:56.083
Now, they can remarry.

07:00.083 --> 07:01.083
Weiwei!

07:01.833 --> 07:04.625
Did you know that Zhenshui
is going to marry Xiaoyu Yaoyao?

07:04.833 --> 07:05.708
Xiaoyu Yaoyao?

07:05.958 --> 07:07.875
The number one beauty in the game.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.625
The whole server knows.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.375
Gosh, I never thought that
Zhenshui would be overwhelmed by lust.

07:14.541 --> 07:16.625
Anyway, Xiaoyu Yaoyao is really beautiful.

07:16.708 --> 07:18.083
A champion of a reality show.

07:18.166 --> 07:21.083
The system honored her
as the number one beauty in the game.

07:22.125 --> 07:22.958
Look!

07:23.458 --> 07:26.041
-She is beautiful, isn't she?
-Is this a real picture of her?

07:26.208 --> 07:28.041
If not, why would Zhenshui court her?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.125
Weiwei.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.250
Actually...

07:34.916 --> 07:37.958
You're ranked seventh in the PvP rankings
and is such a powerful player.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.916
But you don't use YY,
you don't show your picture

07:40.000 --> 07:41.250
and you don't have any equipment.

07:42.125 --> 07:44.583
So, everyone thinks you're a guy.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.041
Like an actual guy!

07:50.000 --> 07:51.791
They think I'm a guy
because I don't have a picture?

07:51.875 --> 07:53.750
Can a world that only values
pretty faces get better?

07:53.833 --> 07:54.833
Bei Weiwei.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.083
Only a goddess like you
would dare say such a thing.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.375
How are we supposed to live then?

07:59.333 --> 08:01.375
You sounded as if you're not beautiful.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.916
-Are you crazy?
-Weiwei.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.500
Someone said you have a sugar daddy.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.000
-What?
-Who?

08:08.666 --> 08:10.291
"A smiling girl leaning on a BMW.

08:10.375 --> 08:14.166
A new game between a wealthy businessman
and a college girl."

08:14.583 --> 08:16.208
-Holy cow!
-Holy cow!

08:16.500 --> 08:17.333
Who is Cao Guang?

08:17.416 --> 08:20.083
A student in the Journalism Department,
director of our university's news center.

08:28.916 --> 08:31.125
-Who is that?
-Excuse me, which one of you is Cao Guang?

08:31.250 --> 08:32.666
It's her, the one with the sugar daddy.

08:32.750 --> 08:33.750
Why are you looking for me?

08:33.916 --> 08:35.208
I just want to ask you

08:35.291 --> 08:36.875
what kind of worldview you'd develop

08:36.958 --> 08:39.083
-if you log onto porn sites once a week.
-Porn sites?

08:40.041 --> 08:40.916
What did you say?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.166
Every Wednesday, you browse porn sites
while you are on duty at the duty room

08:43.250 --> 08:44.291
in the Journalism Department.

08:44.375 --> 08:46.208
What kind of worldview can you develop?

08:46.833 --> 08:47.666
You!

08:51.375 --> 08:53.458
Cao Guang is on duty every Wednesday.

08:53.541 --> 08:55.500
His working hours
are from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.541
During this time, the computer at
that office is directly linked to this IP.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.291
And this IP is connected
to the largest domestic porn site.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.666
Bullshit!

09:03.291 --> 09:04.375
I didn't do it.

09:04.458 --> 09:06.541
You played a card game
called Fight the Landlord

09:06.625 --> 09:08.625
on a website called Beauty Valley,
didn't you?

09:08.958 --> 09:10.125
Yes, that's right!

09:10.708 --> 09:12.708
There's a link
on the home page of Beauty Valley.

09:12.791 --> 09:15.291
It opens this website
on the backend to control the traffic.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.375
But if we just look at
your Internet browsing history,

09:17.458 --> 09:19.125
we can conclude
that you're browsing porn sites.

09:19.458 --> 09:20.833
-That is so creepy.
-So, this shows that

09:20.916 --> 09:22.500
you shouldn't interpret things
out of context.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.458
You released my picture
on the university's website.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.958
Did you ever ask me about the relationship
between me and the BMW driver?

09:31.083 --> 09:32.416
This happened three days ago.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.666
You took a picture of me
at the university's gate,

09:34.750 --> 09:36.000
after I got out of the car.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.875
Then, you hinted that a college girl
in our university has a sugar daddy.

09:40.833 --> 09:41.708
I got it.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.958
You came here to find me
because you want me to delete the post.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.125
Is that right?

09:49.041 --> 09:51.708
This is my Tutor Application Form filed at
the University Affairs Department.

09:51.791 --> 09:54.333
The name of Party A is Ms. Li Rufen,
a divorced and single mother.

09:54.541 --> 09:55.916
She has a 10-year-old child.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.541
I tutor him English and Math.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.958
This is Ms. Li Rufen's Kaixin page.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.083
This is her and her son next to the BMW,

10:05.166 --> 10:07.208
the same car that Cao Guang
took a picture of.

10:07.291 --> 10:09.333
She dropped me off that day
after I tutored her son.

10:09.416 --> 10:12.166
I was thanking her
when Cao Guang took the picture.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.041
I can forgive you despite
your negative outlook towards the world,

10:14.125 --> 10:16.583
your shortsightedness
and your weak and rude reasoning.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.333
But I think you owe me an apology

10:18.791 --> 10:20.750
because you claimed
that I have a sugar daddy

10:20.875 --> 10:22.833
without figuring out
what was really going on first.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.291
You're majoring in journalism.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.708
Why are you starting a campy TV series?

10:30.791 --> 10:33.291
Bei Weiwei, are you here
to get revenge on me?

10:35.583 --> 10:37.416
I'm only here to correct your worldview.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.166
She has returned with glory!

10:51.541 --> 10:52.666
What happened?

10:54.041 --> 10:55.666
What happened when you got even
with that jerk?

10:55.750 --> 10:58.041
Did he kneel and beg for mercy?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.208
Of course he did!

10:59.375 --> 11:01.375
That moment, I, Bei, the Bladeswoman,
was seen breaking into his classroom

11:01.500 --> 11:03.291
and attacking him with a move called
Black Tiger's Digging Out Heart,

11:03.375 --> 11:05.166
that bastard was knocked out
with a single crack.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.250
-Our university's big shot, Xiao Nai.
-Xiao Nai.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.833
He's from the Computer Department.

11:08.916 --> 11:10.666
-What's up?
-He's a computer genius

11:10.750 --> 11:13.041
and even came in first at the swim meet.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.625
Yes, why not prove it?

11:14.833 --> 11:17.333
-Anyway, I'm not making it up.
-I'll show it to you.

11:28.125 --> 11:30.500
It's a one-way glass, so he can't see us.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.208
Let her give it a try.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.625
-He can't see us for sure.
-He can't see us.

11:41.708 --> 11:42.875
-He can't see me.
-He can't see.

11:42.958 --> 11:44.250
Xiao Nai.

11:45.750 --> 11:47.958
-Master! He can't see me.
-You're so cute.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.791
Look how tight his skin is!

11:49.958 --> 11:51.666
-So handsome!
-Look how long his eyelashes are!

12:50.916 --> 12:51.750
I know.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.458
You think the reciprocal square root
remains invariable,

12:55.041 --> 12:57.291
so the click speed can only be doubled.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.166
But I'm trying to say

12:59.583 --> 13:01.541
that the reciprocal square root
can be optimized.

13:01.625 --> 13:03.416
Xiao Nai is a master indeed.
I worship him.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.583
I worship him too.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.708
Me too.

13:05.875 --> 13:06.708
What?

13:06.916 --> 13:09.458
He turned two reciprocal
square root functions into one.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.583
He used a shortcut
calculation method for that.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.750
Awesome!

13:20.625 --> 13:21.666
Hi, Xiao Nai.

13:22.083 --> 13:23.958
I'm Meng Yiran
from the Foreign Language Department.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.041
I like you.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.250
I watch all of your basketball games.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.083
I have a performance tomorrow evening.

13:29.791 --> 13:31.125
I hope you can come.

13:33.833 --> 13:36.208
Sorry, I have to work tomorrow evening.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.458
I'll continue to support you!

13:44.791 --> 13:46.750
He turned her down.

13:47.208 --> 13:48.625
That was sad.

13:51.958 --> 13:55.291
Finally, a discount for this lipstick!
I've been waiting for this a long time.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.375
-Really?
-Check again!

13:57.458 --> 14:00.083
-I beg you, find some food.
-No.

14:00.166 --> 14:01.541
ZHENSHUI WUXIANG TO MARRY XIAOYU YAOYAO

14:02.750 --> 14:03.666
So rich!

14:04.000 --> 14:06.333
If I had that much money,
I'd use it to upgrade my equipment.

14:06.708 --> 14:08.708
Xiaoyu Yaoyao is
the number one beauty on the server.

14:08.791 --> 14:10.458
-Grand wedding ceremony!
-He's handing out money

14:10.541 --> 14:12.333
-and property.
-Zhenshui Wuxiang hired many NPCs.

14:12.416 --> 14:15.166
-It must cost him a lot, right?
-He's so nice, I want to marry him too.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.875
He got remarried so quick.

14:17.666 --> 14:19.416
Weiwei, cockroach!

14:21.958 --> 14:22.833
Where?

14:26.541 --> 14:27.791
It's big.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.791
-Here! More, please!
-Walk a bit further.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.583
-That...
-Don't push!

14:33.666 --> 14:35.000
-It's different with ours.
-Who's that?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.833
Isn't that Zhenshui Wuxiang's ex-wife?

14:36.916 --> 14:37.791
Weiwei!

14:42.458 --> 14:45.083
To catch the cockroach,
only one word is needed. Timing!

14:45.166 --> 14:46.708
One moment earlier or later, and it...

14:48.333 --> 14:50.208
Didn't Zhenshui just divorce Luwei Weiwei?

14:50.291 --> 14:52.375
-She seems so sad.
-Weiwei.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.125
Weren't you happy when we got a divorce?

14:54.208 --> 14:55.291
I wanted to compensate you,

14:55.375 --> 14:56.625
-but you declined.
-Why is she here?

14:56.708 --> 14:59.166
-Weiwei.
-Support Weiwei to stop this marriage!

14:59.375 --> 15:02.750
-Support Weiwei to stop this marriage!
-Support Weiwei to stop this marriage!

15:03.916 --> 15:05.166
I'll take care of you from now on.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.875
What are you trying to do, Luwei Weiwei?

15:11.125 --> 15:13.875
What exactly do you want to do?

15:14.083 --> 15:15.208
It's all your fault.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.500
Everyone, it's all because
I was trying to catch a cockroach.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.708
Luwei Weiwei is among
the top ten in battle rankings.

15:23.791 --> 15:26.625
-Xiaoyu Yaoyao and I are a good match.
-Get lost. Xiaoyu Yaoyao is mine.

15:26.875 --> 15:29.291
-Zhenshui's choice is not bad!
-Support Weiwei to stop this marriage!

15:29.375 --> 15:31.500
-Support Weiwei to stop this marriage!
-Support Weiwei to stop this marriage!

15:31.583 --> 15:33.041
If I run away now,

15:33.166 --> 15:36.166
will they say that I ran away crying?

15:38.458 --> 15:39.708
-Snatch the groom!
-Snatch the groom!

15:39.791 --> 15:42.125
-Everyone, take a look at my collections!
-Snatch the groom!

15:42.208 --> 15:44.833
-I have all the latest potions.
-Snatch the groom!

15:45.083 --> 15:48.208
-Twenty percent off everything.
-The latest potions!

15:48.291 --> 15:50.958
It’s difficult to get these normally.
We have to be quick.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.541
-I'll take one!
-So, will I!

15:53.708 --> 15:54.875
What a bargain today!

15:54.958 --> 15:56.958
-Quick!
-Catch.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.125
We're sold out for today.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.791
-Thank you for buying!
-It's sold out!

16:05.875 --> 16:06.791
Gosh.

16:07.666 --> 16:10.083
-Is everything sold out?
-I didn’t get anything.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.833
What a pity!

16:11.958 --> 16:14.666
-Find Weiwei...
-Let's snatch some gold coins.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.083
Come on! Scramble for gold coins!

16:18.708 --> 16:20.125
Four, six, eight... One more.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.583
Why? Don't we have enough?

16:21.666 --> 16:24.458
Xiaoxi is not here. We need more.
Keep moving.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.208
YIXIAO NAIHE

16:38.291 --> 16:39.625
Yixiao Naihe.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.416
PLAYER YIXIAO NAIHE HAS SENT YOU
A FRIEND REQUEST.

16:43.541 --> 16:46.166
Master! Idol! Rich person!

16:46.250 --> 16:49.208
-Luwei Weiwei.
-Master Naihe, I've heard a lot about you!

16:51.916 --> 16:53.458
What do you think of the wedding ceremony?

16:54.875 --> 16:56.791
Did he come here just to gossip?

16:58.416 --> 16:59.500
It's a very grand wedding!

16:59.583 --> 17:01.583
Do you want
an even bigger wedding ceremony?

17:02.708 --> 17:03.750
Marry me.

17:07.666 --> 17:08.583
Master!

17:09.125 --> 17:10.291
Did someone hack your account?

17:10.375 --> 17:12.375
Did you see the latest notice
on the official website?

17:13.291 --> 17:14.833
About the contest for in-game spouses?

17:15.333 --> 17:16.875
Is that why you want to marry me?

17:16.958 --> 17:19.500
You're the only female
who is in the top ten in battle rankings.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.041
Your strength is formidable.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.125
If we join hands,

17:27.208 --> 17:29.666
who else could be the best
across the server besides us?

17:30.041 --> 17:31.291
Okay, let's do it.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.500
Let's go to the Matchmaker Temple now.
Let's go.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.541
Wait!

17:36.833 --> 17:38.041
I need to prepare for it.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.041
-Prepare what?
-The wedding ceremony.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.208
It's really simple.

17:41.291 --> 17:43.333
It's right after registration.
I've been married before.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.583
I'm Yixiao Naihe.
I can't have such a simple wedding.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.916
I have something to tell you.

18:02.083 --> 18:03.166
What's up?

18:03.625 --> 18:04.583
Did you get the investment?

18:04.833 --> 18:05.958
-Is it true?
-What happened?

18:06.125 --> 18:06.958
Hurry, speak!

18:07.458 --> 18:08.416
I'm going to get married.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.541
You don't even have a girlfriend.
Who will you marry?

18:10.625 --> 18:11.583
Exactly!

18:11.791 --> 18:13.041
Where is the bride?

18:13.333 --> 18:15.041
When is the wedding ceremony?

18:15.291 --> 18:17.666
-Cut it out!
-I mean

18:18.541 --> 18:20.500
I'm getting married in Mengyou Jianghu.

18:22.541 --> 18:24.500
It's not complicated
to get married in the game.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.875
-Use a package.
-There are packages at different prices.

18:28.458 --> 18:29.625
I won't use packaged services.

18:30.166 --> 18:31.250
It's too impersonal.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.250
Hey...

18:34.375 --> 18:35.666
"It's too impersonal."

18:37.833 --> 18:39.500
I'm going to marry Yixiao Naihe.

18:43.916 --> 18:47.250
I've played Mengyou Jianghu for so long,
but I've never seen Master Naihe.

18:47.958 --> 18:48.958
I just met him too.

18:49.041 --> 18:50.666
You're going to get married
just like that?

18:51.166 --> 18:53.666
What does he look like in real life?
Is he tall and handsome?

18:53.916 --> 18:57.875
Hey, he is a talented musician
with unparalleled skills.

18:57.958 --> 18:59.541
And he is super handsome.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.500
What are you talking about?

19:01.625 --> 19:03.500
I asked about Yixiao Naihe in real life.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.333
-How would I know?
-I don't know either.

19:05.416 --> 19:06.333
You don't know?

19:06.958 --> 19:09.666
Bei Weiwei, aren't you guys
moving too fast?

19:09.791 --> 19:11.583
You don't understand
because you don't play games.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.833
All you do to have an in-game wedding
is have a ceremony.

19:14.666 --> 19:16.083
I want a wedding ceremony too.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.166
But no one wants to marry me.

19:20.416 --> 19:23.000
How about I make
a male character marry you?

19:23.166 --> 19:25.208
Why don't you give birth to a baby
and let him marry me?

19:28.541 --> 19:30.541
MATCHMAKER TEMPLE

19:43.375 --> 19:44.208
GIFT, BAG

19:44.291 --> 19:46.375
EQUIPMENT, WEAPONRY

19:46.583 --> 19:47.541
What is this?

19:49.375 --> 19:50.250
Betrothal gift.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.083
Is this what it feels like
to marry someone with money?

19:55.291 --> 19:57.458
This is so awesome!

19:58.041 --> 19:58.916
DECLINE

20:05.416 --> 20:06.333
Take it.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.375
You can use it for battles in the future.

20:10.666 --> 20:11.708
ACCEPT

20:13.166 --> 20:14.833
Well, let's begin.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.958
LUWEI WEIWEI GIVES YOU
A TOP-CLASS CLOAK AS A GIFT

20:18.708 --> 20:19.958
-This is...
-My dowry.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.333
I never take anything
without giving something.

20:25.208 --> 20:26.041
ACCEPT

20:47.416 --> 20:50.416
Luwei Weiwei and Yixiao Naihe agree

20:50.500 --> 20:52.833
that they will love
and stay with each other for life

20:53.083 --> 20:56.583
after they get married
in the Matchmaker Temple.

20:56.666 --> 20:58.041
She married the number one master.

21:02.791 --> 21:03.916
These are my teammates.

21:04.458 --> 21:07.166
Yugong, Houzijiu and Mozhata.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.333
This is Luwei Weiwei.

21:09.416 --> 21:10.791
Nice to meet you!

21:10.875 --> 21:12.250
It's rumored that you're a guy.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.291
Are you really a guy
who plays as a female character?

21:14.750 --> 21:16.750
-Houzijiu, what are you talking about?
-Are you

21:16.833 --> 21:19.625
the ex-wife of Zhenshui Wuxiang
from Blue Sea Tide Clan?

21:19.708 --> 21:21.541
Why did you get married
to our brother this soon?

21:22.666 --> 21:24.375
The guy she married before
isn't a human being.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.875
You're not allowed to insult her.

21:26.291 --> 21:29.541
Whether they are men or women,
our team needs mighty teammates.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.416
-Hello, sister-in-law!
-Hello, sister-in-law!

22:32.750 --> 22:35.125
This is the most special wedding ceremony
in the whole server.

22:35.541 --> 22:36.583
How amazing!

22:36.750 --> 22:38.875
-This wedding is so wonderful.
-Flying Mounts!

22:39.333 --> 22:41.833
I didn't even know about Flying Mounts'
existence in Mengyou Jianghu.

22:41.958 --> 22:45.458
It puts Zhenshui Wuxiang's
wedding ceremony to shame.

22:45.541 --> 22:48.416
Luwei Weiwei's wedding ceremony
is way better than Zhenshui Wuxiang's.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.750
Exactly. I'm so happy for her.

23:32.500 --> 23:33.416
Why are you smiling?

23:35.625 --> 23:36.583
I'm not.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.083
You definitely smiled just now.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.708
You must be hiding something from me.

23:49.333 --> 23:50.375
What are you talking about?

23:54.208 --> 23:55.541
Are you falling in love?

23:55.666 --> 23:56.791
Shush!

23:57.166 --> 23:58.166
Stop talking nonsense.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.208
-What are you doing?
-Weiwei, it's me.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.083
Do you still remember me?

24:26.833 --> 24:29.041
Cao Guang? What do you want?

24:30.166 --> 24:32.083
It's 9:48 p.m.

24:32.625 --> 24:35.416
Please remember this moment.
This is the moment when our love begins.

24:36.416 --> 24:40.041
From now on, I'm going
to give you everything I have.

24:42.416 --> 24:45.750
Since that time
when you corrected my worldview,

24:46.125 --> 24:47.541
I haven't been able to forget you.

24:48.458 --> 24:51.208
Can you continue to help me
become a better person?

24:51.416 --> 24:53.791
-What are you thinking?
-Thinking about you.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.166
We're not a good fit.

24:57.916 --> 25:00.166
I can do whatever you like.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.916
It has nothing to do with that.
It's just because...

25:03.125 --> 25:04.916
You and I

25:05.458 --> 25:07.875
-are not possible.
-It's not a matter of possibilities.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.708
Besides, maybe the best is yet to come.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.125
To tell you the truth,

25:14.208 --> 25:16.541
I actually want to find a boyfriend
from the Computer Department.

25:16.625 --> 25:19.750
-A boyfriend from the Computer Department?
-I'm from the Computer Department.

25:20.875 --> 25:23.708
Are all the guys
in the Computer Department slobs?

25:23.916 --> 25:26.333
-Do you like guys like that?
-What's wrong with that?

25:27.125 --> 25:30.083
The girls in our department
like guys like me.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.750
You have no chance.

25:35.708 --> 25:36.958
Stay away from my stuff.

25:41.708 --> 25:45.000
But the girls from your department
seem to neglect their appearances too.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.958
Look, a small ball.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.750
"The guys from the Computer Department."

25:55.375 --> 25:58.333
What should a guy
from the Computer Department look like?

26:00.208 --> 26:02.708
Do I look like a student
from the Computer Department?

26:02.791 --> 26:03.666
Leave me alone.

26:06.875 --> 26:07.958
What took you so long?

26:09.250 --> 26:11.083
I saw the hottest girl
of our department just now.

26:11.375 --> 26:13.041
It's Bei Weiwei, the sophomore.

26:13.125 --> 26:15.583
Cao Guang, a student from
the Journalism Department is courting her.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.583
He stopped her
at the study room's entrance.

26:17.958 --> 26:19.541
He's confessing his love to her now.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.750
I'm wondering, is it necessary for us
to stay late every night?

26:27.958 --> 26:29.875
Then, stay up all night?

26:30.833 --> 26:32.166
Hey, Xiao Nai!

26:32.625 --> 26:33.791
Where are you going?

26:34.083 --> 26:35.250
Thank you for liking me.

26:35.666 --> 26:38.208
I'm sorry, but let's stop
wasting our time.

26:38.291 --> 26:41.041
-I don't feel like it's a waste of time.
-But I feel it is.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.416
I truly want to find a boyfriend
from the Computer Department.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.083
Even though you talk so much about it,
you haven't found the one you love.

26:46.166 --> 26:47.916
Then, why don't you give me a chance?

26:50.916 --> 26:52.666
To tell you the truth,
I already have someone.

26:53.333 --> 26:54.625
I was too shy to tell you just now.

26:54.791 --> 26:56.166
He's also from the Computer Department.

26:56.416 --> 26:57.500
Who is it?

26:59.458 --> 27:00.541
Master Xiao Nai.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.541
Yes, the guy I like is Xiao Nai.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.750
Master, I am sorry.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.916
I had to borrow your name
to help me get away. Forgive me!

27:09.000 --> 27:10.375
Master, bless me, please!

27:11.291 --> 27:13.375
I've been in love with him
since I was a freshman.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.333
But he's so far from me.

27:15.625 --> 27:16.916
He's so tall.

27:17.333 --> 27:21.041
Although he's never set eyes on me,
my unrequited love for him

27:22.083 --> 27:24.083
will never change.

27:24.375 --> 27:25.916
My love is unwavering.

27:29.250 --> 27:30.291
Thank you!

27:32.416 --> 27:33.583
You're welcome!

27:35.416 --> 27:36.291
Weiwei!

27:50.541 --> 27:51.458
Actually...

27:52.000 --> 27:54.250
"I've been in love with him
since I was a freshman.

27:54.333 --> 27:55.541
But he's so far from me.

27:55.750 --> 27:57.000
He's so tall.

27:57.125 --> 28:00.250
Although he's never set eyes on me,
my unrequited love for him

28:00.333 --> 28:02.083
will never change.

28:02.541 --> 28:04.541
My love is unwavering."

28:08.333 --> 28:10.875
May I ask, what do you think of this?

28:11.625 --> 28:12.750
She has good taste.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.041
Look, so narcissistic!

28:15.125 --> 28:16.166
Don't forget.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.875
You're already married in the game.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.583
Luwei Weiwei.

28:20.083 --> 28:20.958
Shush!

28:22.000 --> 28:23.083
Hello, Mr. Li.

28:25.291 --> 28:26.166
No problem!

28:26.958 --> 28:27.791
Okay, sure.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.291
Don't worry!

28:30.458 --> 28:31.458
Mr. Li?

28:31.916 --> 28:34.041
-Is he the one from Youjing Company?
-Yes.

28:34.958 --> 28:37.416
Youjing. One of the three
biggest game companies in China!

28:37.833 --> 28:40.458
They want us to present the proposal
for the Smart City the soonest.

28:40.541 --> 28:41.916
-Great!
-Great!

28:42.333 --> 28:43.875
How much time did they give us?

28:44.958 --> 28:45.791
One week?

28:47.250 --> 28:48.291
Five days?

28:49.666 --> 28:51.500
-Three days?
-Yes.

28:51.583 --> 28:52.500
Holy cow!

28:53.083 --> 28:55.791
-Move, move. It's time to work.
-Hurry up!

28:56.791 --> 28:58.583
Wait for me, guys!

28:58.750 --> 28:59.666
Hurry, hurry.

29:00.833 --> 29:01.916
Hey, don't!

29:13.541 --> 29:15.750
How dare you hack my wife? You're dead!

29:17.750 --> 29:18.708
Up All Night King.

29:19.208 --> 29:20.125
Awesome!

29:21.458 --> 29:23.541
Congrats! I heard you got married again.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.458
-You are still playing Spore.
-It's fun.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.583
I got married in this game.

29:30.916 --> 29:31.750
Got married?

29:32.625 --> 29:34.000
Pretty cute!

29:40.875 --> 29:42.041
Which one is your wife?

29:42.208 --> 29:43.125
It's not her account.

29:43.208 --> 29:45.250
-Not hers.
-Let me have a look.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.416
-No, don't click the one at the top.
-Hurry, let me look.

29:47.833 --> 29:49.500
-Gosh, do I still have any privacy?
-Hey!

29:51.458 --> 29:52.750
KO.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.250
-You're serious?
-Yes, I'm serious.

29:55.583 --> 29:56.791
You are blushing.

29:57.541 --> 29:59.458
Are you really falling in love
with someone in a game?

30:00.500 --> 30:02.541
How do you feel?

30:02.708 --> 30:04.833
You've been married twice,
but you ask me how it feels?

30:09.166 --> 30:12.583
I only got married in a game
to finish quests.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.333
Moreover, I don't even know
what he looks like.

30:15.750 --> 30:16.916
I have my standards.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.416
Hey, do you really feel
the relationship in a game

30:28.500 --> 30:30.208
can evolve into a real relationship?

30:31.666 --> 30:32.916
Feelings are feelings.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.916
It's hard to tell if they are
from a game or real life.

30:41.291 --> 30:44.083
Our clan's provisional action to fight
the boss has been canceled this evening.

30:44.166 --> 30:45.083
You don't need to show up.

30:46.083 --> 30:47.208
What's up?

30:48.958 --> 30:50.583
I didn't receive the notice from our clan.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.333
Sorry!

30:52.416 --> 30:55.041
Zhenshui should have notified you,
but he's busy today.

30:57.833 --> 30:58.916
It doesn't matter.

31:09.291 --> 31:10.291
What are you trying to do?

31:10.375 --> 31:12.291
Why didn't you show up
to fight the boss this evening?

31:12.375 --> 31:13.333
Why didn't you make it?

31:14.166 --> 31:15.666
I was told it was canceled. Wasn't it?

31:17.125 --> 31:18.375
We were robbed of the boss.

31:18.708 --> 31:20.750
The entire clan showed up except you.

31:21.083 --> 31:23.958
Recently, didn't you join
Houzijiu and his teammates to level up?

31:24.125 --> 31:25.875
I got married to Yixiao Naihe
to fulfill quests.

31:25.958 --> 31:27.583
Of course I need to play
with them frequently.

31:27.875 --> 31:30.666
Weiwei, I understand
that you didn't have a choice.

31:30.750 --> 31:32.125
You got married to Yixiao Naihe,

31:32.208 --> 31:34.083
so you need to consider
their team's interests.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.416
Never mind.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.875
I can talk to Zhenshui
and the other members for you.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.916
After all, you've been
in this clan for a long time.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.625
You fought really hard for this clan.

31:41.708 --> 31:44.333
Even so, you shouldn't disclose
the secrets of our clan!

31:44.750 --> 31:47.291
You didn't show up, that's fine.
But you let others rob us of our boss.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.583
Wasn't it hard for our team
to watch over the boss for so long?

31:50.000 --> 31:50.958
That's enough, Qingqing.

31:51.041 --> 31:54.083
If you keep on talking, all of us
will mistake Weiwei as a traitor.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.375
-What did you say?
-Traitor!

31:55.458 --> 31:57.958
-Traitor!
-Traitor!

32:01.125 --> 32:02.250
Calm down, everyone.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.208
Drop your weapons. Drop them!

32:05.916 --> 32:08.125
Weiwei has been one of us
since the first day

32:08.208 --> 32:10.291
the Blue Sea Tide Clan was established.

32:10.375 --> 32:11.958
-Have you all forgotten that?
-Forget it!

32:13.208 --> 32:15.000
I don't want to look into
this matter anymore.

32:20.583 --> 32:21.791
Luwei Weiwei.

32:22.291 --> 32:24.625
Let this be
my divorce compensation to you.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.458
Blue Sea Tide Clan
is no longer what it was.

32:31.875 --> 32:32.708
Weiwei!

32:32.791 --> 32:35.333
Do you really want to leave
the Blue Sea Tide Clan?

32:35.833 --> 32:37.541
You dare betray our clan?

32:38.000 --> 32:38.833
Yes.

32:41.791 --> 32:42.625
Weiwei...

32:43.375 --> 32:46.083
Luwei Weiwei was suspected
of disclosing our clan's secrets,

32:46.541 --> 32:47.916
so she left!

32:48.000 --> 32:52.250
GAME SETTING, THUNDERBOLT KYLIN

32:52.333 --> 32:53.916
I'm really confident about our proposal.

32:54.958 --> 32:56.750
It's time for us to meet
with Youjing Company.

32:59.791 --> 33:01.666
Let's go. We'll go eat.

33:02.083 --> 33:02.916
Let's go!

33:09.416 --> 33:10.416
Hey, Xiao Nai.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.291
Come here and have a look at it.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.875
It seems that someone plotted
against Luwei Weiwei.

33:17.583 --> 33:19.083
LUWEI WEIWEI IS SHAMELESS!
GET OUT OF HERE!

33:19.166 --> 33:20.000
Look.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.625
Did you take the boss
of the Blue Sea Tide Clan?

33:24.708 --> 33:26.208
Who would take their boss for no reason?

33:26.291 --> 33:28.750
Someone sent out an SOS signal just now.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.041
We rushed over to help
and slayed the boss easily.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.791
Once we finished, we came across players
from the Blue Sea Tide Clan.

33:34.125 --> 33:36.666
Were they waiting there the whole time?

33:38.416 --> 33:40.666
-Is the SOS message still available?
-I have a screenshot of it.

33:40.750 --> 33:42.041
You even have a screenshot of it?

33:42.208 --> 33:44.208
I noticed it was a female character
who sent the message.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.625
PLAYER XIAOYU MIANMIAN
REQUESTS HELP FROM YOU!

33:47.958 --> 33:50.375
It looks like Weiwei is offline
and has left her clan.

33:50.708 --> 33:52.958
Zhenshui and his followers
are bashing Weiwei in the chatroom.

33:53.416 --> 33:54.833
Should I explain?

33:57.458 --> 33:58.666
There's nothing to explain.

33:59.291 --> 34:03.333
Yixiao Naihe invites Zhenshui Wuxiang
for a duel at Chang'an City.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.583
Zhenshui Wuxiang hasn't accepted
the challenge.

34:05.666 --> 34:08.041
-Her husband and her ex-husband.
-This should be fun.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.625
Yixiao Naihe invites Zhenshui Wuxiang
a second time

34:11.708 --> 34:13.208
for a duel at Chang'an City.

34:13.291 --> 34:15.166
Zhenshui Wuxiang hasn't accepted
the challenge.

34:15.250 --> 34:16.541
You're so ruthless.

34:17.166 --> 34:18.875
You delivered a challenge
via the world chatroom.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.625
If he doesn't accept it,

34:20.791 --> 34:22.666
he'll be too ashamed
to play on this server anymore.

34:23.166 --> 34:25.208
It's a natural thing
for a husband to protect his wife.

34:25.291 --> 34:27.041
-Naihe said he'd fight Zhenshui thrice.
-I only love Master Naihe!

34:27.125 --> 34:28.958
-He only has to win once to be the winner.
-He is not as good as Naihe.

34:29.041 --> 34:31.625
Moreover, he's already downgraded
his equipment to 5,000 points.

34:31.750 --> 34:32.750
Isn't he insulting him?

34:32.833 --> 34:36.541
But Zhenshui is too thick-skinned.
There's still no response.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.250
Then, I'll issue another challenge.

34:39.625 --> 34:43.041
Yixiao Naihe invites Zhenshui Wuxiang
a third time

34:43.125 --> 34:44.833
for a duel at Chang'an City.

34:51.125 --> 34:54.333
Yixiao Naihe invites Zhenshui Wuxiang
a fourth time

34:54.416 --> 34:56.416
-for a duel at Chang'an City.
-Damn it.

34:58.375 --> 34:59.791
Are you crazy?

35:10.750 --> 35:12.916
-Erxi.
-Weiwei, where are you?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.666
Yixiao Naihe and Zhenshui Wuxiang
are going to duel.

35:16.708 --> 35:17.958
Why do you want to fight him?

35:18.041 --> 35:20.166
He has issued a challenge
four times in a row.

35:20.416 --> 35:22.041
This can replenish
your health immediately.

35:34.791 --> 35:36.291
MENGYOU JIANGHU

35:41.333 --> 35:42.958
FIRST ROUND
ZHENSHUI WUXIANG VS YIXIAO NAIHE

35:43.041 --> 35:44.000
ZHENSHUI WUXIANG

35:44.083 --> 35:44.958
YIXIAO NAIHE

37:24.083 --> 37:25.875
SECOND ROUND
ZHENSHUI WUXIANG VS YIXIAO NAIHE

38:01.083 --> 38:04.416
-Amazing!
-He has been defeated.

38:04.500 --> 38:07.750
-He can just give up.
-Why suffer?

38:08.041 --> 38:09.791
-Right.
-Don't struggle anymore. Just surrender.

38:09.875 --> 38:11.458
What is he trying to do?

38:11.541 --> 38:12.541
-What's going on?
-Hey.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.375
-Look.
-Taking a potion?

38:14.458 --> 38:16.875
-He's drinking a potion.
-He has replenished his health.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.083
-His health has been fully replenished.
-Is he cheating?

38:19.208 --> 38:20.708
He must have cheated.

38:20.791 --> 38:23.416
-Do you have no shame?
-You still can't beat him like this.

38:27.375 --> 38:28.458
Gosh!

38:35.916 --> 38:39.041
Dude, we're just playing a game.

38:39.416 --> 38:41.208
Is Luwei Weiwei worth it?

38:49.166 --> 38:51.541
BIHAI CHAOSHENG HOUSE

39:10.125 --> 39:13.958
-You were so strong just now.
-That's right!

39:15.458 --> 39:17.916
-Come on, let's eat.
-Great! Let's go.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.500
-I don't feel hungry. You go ahead.
-Okay.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.916
Weiwei, I want to take you somewhere.

39:40.958 --> 39:42.416
It's so beautiful here.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.125
What is this place?

39:45.416 --> 39:46.416
I don't know either.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.166
It's very strange.

39:49.333 --> 39:51.041
It's not on the map.

39:51.958 --> 39:53.375
I call it Sunset Peak.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.125
Is there such a beautiful place
in Mengyou Jianghu?

39:57.041 --> 39:58.583
Why haven't I been here before?

40:00.125 --> 40:02.666
Only the top five players
in the PvP rankings can come here.

40:03.208 --> 40:04.750
I'm not one of the top five yet.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.750
You're my wife now.

40:10.166 --> 40:11.375
Of course you can come here.

40:31.625 --> 40:33.541
I should have waited
for you to deal with this.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.875
But too many people were paying attention.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.541
I thought it was better to settle this
as soon as possible.

41:34.041 --> 41:35.416
BIHAI CHAOSHENG HOUSE

41:40.750 --> 41:42.791
ZHENSHUI WUXIANG

42:04.458 --> 42:05.291
Damn it!

42:05.375 --> 42:06.750
How dare you cheat in the duel?

42:16.625 --> 42:18.666
Who? Who's up there?

42:21.833 --> 42:23.000
Are you mad?

42:23.083 --> 42:24.583
You bitch!

42:26.791 --> 42:28.250
How dare you bully my sister-in-law!

42:28.333 --> 42:29.583
Who's your sister-in-law?

42:29.666 --> 42:31.333
Why don't you say
I bullied your aunt instead?

42:31.458 --> 42:32.458
Crazy!

42:55.083 --> 42:57.333
You're awful.
You've been killing me since just now!

42:58.166 --> 42:59.458
I'll kill you!

43:01.208 --> 43:02.291
Go to hell!

43:11.916 --> 43:13.541
MENGYOU JIANGHU

-Sure.

43:39.041 --> 43:40.583
-Take care of yourselves!
-Okay.

43:40.875 --> 43:42.625
-I'm leaving.
-Bye.

43:42.708 --> 43:44.166
-Bye.
-Bye!

43:44.250 --> 43:45.083
Bye!

43:47.541 --> 43:49.166
Apparently, there are people in this world

43:49.250 --> 43:50.916
who become a couple through games.

43:51.375 --> 43:53.666
They're even planning on
studying abroad together.

43:53.958 --> 43:55.166
I should give them my best wishes.

43:56.083 --> 43:59.083
All of the gods here and abroad,
please bless Zhantianxia and Diemeng,

43:59.166 --> 44:00.958
so that their love
can be everlasting and steadfast.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.458
Don't forget tomorrow's final tournament.

44:04.750 --> 44:05.875
At half past seven.

44:06.208 --> 44:08.416
I have a meeting in the afternoon.
See you at seven.

44:08.750 --> 44:11.208
Okay. I will wait for you
in front of the NPCs.

44:14.833 --> 44:17.000
HUSBAND OF LUWEI WEIWEI, YIXIAO NAIHE

44:26.541 --> 44:28.416
LUWEI WEIWEI

44:29.000 --> 44:30.750
WIFE OF YIXIAO NAIHE, LUWEI WEIWEI

44:31.291 --> 44:32.375
For players,

44:32.708 --> 44:35.333
the biggest difference between
standalone games and online games

44:35.458 --> 44:37.333
is the interaction among players.

44:37.750 --> 44:39.083
Apart from interaction,

44:39.375 --> 44:40.583
what can move players the most

44:40.666 --> 44:42.666
is the sense of escape offered
by the entire game world.

44:42.958 --> 44:45.041
Therefore, I hope that the Smart City

44:45.125 --> 44:46.750
can evolve into a vivid world.

44:47.375 --> 44:49.458
For example, the unique background
that we set up for NPCs,

44:49.541 --> 44:52.166
their living environment
and their way of reacting to things.

44:52.791 --> 44:54.625
When they face
different players and incidents,

44:54.708 --> 44:56.875
they will have different AI reactions.

44:57.166 --> 45:01.166
Players won't be able to tell
whether they are NPCs

45:01.500 --> 45:02.583
or other players.

45:02.666 --> 45:03.666
Good!

45:05.250 --> 45:06.208
Very good!

45:06.416 --> 45:08.583
Your idea is very interesting!
I like it very much!

45:09.416 --> 45:11.541
But an online game

45:11.958 --> 45:13.875
needs at least 100 million yuan
for investment.

45:14.875 --> 45:16.083
It's a huge investment.

45:16.166 --> 45:18.416
We need to have lots of discussions
before we make the decision.

45:18.666 --> 45:19.500
Don't worry!

45:19.958 --> 45:21.125
Wait for my good news.

45:21.458 --> 45:23.083
-Thank you, Mr. Li!
-Really?

45:24.250 --> 45:25.458
Hey, you're here too.

45:25.583 --> 45:26.833
Luwei Weiwei is here.

45:27.125 --> 45:27.958
Weiwei!

45:28.458 --> 45:29.791
You have to win the tournament.

45:29.875 --> 45:31.833
We're expecting a bonus
for the whole area if you win.

45:31.916 --> 45:33.125
-Come on!
-Come on!

45:34.125 --> 45:35.958
I'll wait for you in front of the NPCs.

45:36.208 --> 45:37.500
You can come here directly.

45:42.083 --> 45:43.750
COUNTDOWN TO BEGIN COUPLE CROSS-SERVER
9 MINUTES

45:49.833 --> 45:51.666
How can he not come
for such an important contest?

45:51.750 --> 45:53.791
How can she participate
in this couple tournament alone?

45:53.875 --> 45:56.041
-It's still early.
-It's the final today!

45:56.625 --> 45:57.750
Poor girl!

45:57.833 --> 45:59.166
Why he is still not here?

45:59.250 --> 46:00.666
He must have stood her up.

46:00.750 --> 46:02.750
3 MINUTES

46:12.166 --> 46:14.208
1 MINUTE

46:16.250 --> 46:19.500
You must enter the battleground
together with your husband.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.375
Since Yixiao Naihe
and Luwei Weiwei forfeited,

46:37.666 --> 46:39.750
the winners of the couple tournament

46:39.958 --> 46:44.375
are Jiushi Bazhu and Hehua Yidianxin.

46:57.958 --> 46:59.250
YIXIAO NAIHE

47:12.500 --> 47:16.708
INTERNET CAFE

47:19.000 --> 47:20.041
You were stood up?

47:21.333 --> 47:22.375
How did you know?

47:23.458 --> 47:27.041
I'm the network administrator here.
Is it really weird that I know that?

47:27.833 --> 47:30.708
In fact, I don't mind at all
that we didn't win.

47:31.333 --> 47:32.291
It's just that...

47:32.458 --> 47:34.958
It's just that you're not sure
if he'll ever show up again.

47:37.041 --> 47:39.208
Players disappear all the time.

47:39.916 --> 47:41.083
You need to get used to it.

47:41.458 --> 47:44.583
Do you still remember I once told you
about the game that I'm playing?

47:47.333 --> 47:48.791
I made a friend in the game.

47:49.083 --> 47:50.250
She was very nice to me.

47:50.791 --> 47:51.875
We got married.

47:53.416 --> 47:55.541
Then, one day she just disappeared.

47:56.500 --> 47:57.875
And she hasn't been back since.

47:59.708 --> 48:02.916
Later, I hacked her account and found out
she was from this university.

48:03.416 --> 48:04.625
Did you find her?

48:06.083 --> 48:08.000
I've waited so long,
but she has never appeared.

48:08.875 --> 48:10.833
I don't think
she wants to talk to me anymore.

48:12.041 --> 48:13.333
But you still have a chance.

48:14.958 --> 48:15.916
Silly girl!

48:16.125 --> 48:17.875
-Come on!
-Thanks!

48:23.083 --> 48:24.083
You're back.

48:26.041 --> 48:27.583
I've been looking for you.

48:28.958 --> 48:30.083
You were looking for me?

48:30.500 --> 48:31.875
Actually, it's not me.

48:31.958 --> 48:33.416
It's Houzijiu who's looking for you.

48:34.083 --> 48:37.083
-Houzijiu?
-Houzijiu from your team.

48:37.500 --> 48:40.000
He's been following me
in the game all day.

48:40.083 --> 48:42.416
He said he wanted to apologize to you.
He's really annoying.

48:44.541 --> 48:45.500
Is he online now?

48:46.166 --> 48:47.375
Yes, he is still online.

48:53.291 --> 48:55.958
I'm sorry, sister-in-law!
Please kill me immediately!

48:57.916 --> 48:58.833
What's up?

48:59.083 --> 49:00.666
We went out to eat
on the day of the final.

49:00.791 --> 49:03.375
I was driving the car on our way back,
then I smashed it into a tree.

49:05.708 --> 49:07.666
-Is everything okay?
-The car is fine.

49:08.125 --> 49:10.666
Fortunately, the insurance company
showed up.

49:11.458 --> 49:12.916
I mean Naihe.

49:13.291 --> 49:16.708
He suffered a slight concussion
and was knocked out for several hours.

49:17.083 --> 49:18.958
What do you mean he was knocked out?

49:21.916 --> 49:22.833
Damn it.

49:22.916 --> 49:25.791
We're fourth-year students, but they still
cut our electricity and Internet at night.

49:25.875 --> 49:28.250
-I haven't finished talking to Weiwei.
-Weiwei?

49:28.958 --> 49:30.000
Weiwei is online?

49:32.041 --> 49:33.625
I was just telling her
about the car accident.

49:33.708 --> 49:35.958
I haven't finished talking to her
and the electricity went out.

49:36.500 --> 49:37.666
-Xiao Nai.
-Xiao Nai.

49:37.916 --> 49:39.125
What are you doing?

50:03.041 --> 50:05.125
You shouldn't be playing games now.
You should be resting.

50:05.375 --> 50:07.416
I'm fine. Sorry!

50:07.708 --> 50:09.791
I stood you up and kept you waiting.

50:11.333 --> 50:13.833
That's not important.
It's not worth mentioning.

50:17.833 --> 50:18.958
Let's meet each other.

50:25.916 --> 50:28.208
Why did she suddenly want
to buy clothes today?

50:28.291 --> 50:29.333
How would I know?

50:29.875 --> 50:32.291
Didn't she say that she liked
to wear clothes with holes in them?

50:32.791 --> 50:35.250
-Don't say that.
-Maybe she remembered she's a girl today.

51:09.916 --> 51:13.833
Bei Weiwei, our final exams are tomorrow.

51:14.166 --> 51:16.083
We've spent our precious time with you,

51:16.166 --> 51:18.083
so tell us the truth
about what you're really doing.

51:18.833 --> 51:21.166
-I have an interview tomorrow.
-Why didn't I know that?

51:21.541 --> 51:24.833
Besides, what kind of company

51:25.083 --> 51:27.166
would have an interview on a Saturday?

51:27.958 --> 51:29.500
Why do you have to dress so formally?

51:29.583 --> 51:31.708
Aren't you always stressing about culture?

51:32.208 --> 51:34.541
Culture? This is culture!

51:35.291 --> 51:37.291
Xiao Ling. Wait! These shoes won't work.

51:37.541 --> 51:40.125
Won't work?
You can't change out of such nice shoes.

51:40.208 --> 51:42.666
These are too tall. What if he...

51:42.750 --> 51:43.583
"He"?

51:44.125 --> 51:45.583
Who is he?

51:45.666 --> 51:47.916
-Tell me.
-Tell me now!

51:48.000 --> 51:49.166
The interviewer.

51:53.166 --> 51:54.875
Ma'am, I'd like to submit my paper.

51:55.708 --> 51:57.625
-The time is not up yet.
-But I'm done.

51:57.833 --> 52:00.458
You can't submit the paper early.
You can recheck it.

52:20.083 --> 52:21.791
-Ma'am.
-Bei Weiwei!

52:22.833 --> 52:24.791
Time is up. Hand in your papers.

52:39.750 --> 52:42.791
Naihe, I’ve heard a lot about you.
I'm Luwei Weiwei.

52:46.375 --> 52:48.666
Naihe, I'm Luwei Weiwei.

52:56.166 --> 52:58.750
Naihe, I'm Luwei...

52:59.833 --> 53:01.916
-Who is Naihe?
-Sorry!

53:02.500 --> 53:03.958
Who is this Naihe guy you're looking for?

53:22.333 --> 53:24.375
Is Xiao Nai waiting for someone?

53:36.875 --> 53:38.500
Why is he coming here while looking at me?

53:39.208 --> 53:40.666
So embarrassing.

53:49.541 --> 53:50.958
Mr. Xiao, what a coincidence.

53:51.583 --> 53:52.708
It's not a coincidence.

53:53.416 --> 53:54.500
I'm waiting for you.

54:02.750 --> 54:03.875
Naihe.

54:05.083 --> 54:06.041
It's me.

54:06.833 --> 54:08.500
I almost made you wait for me again.

54:15.416 --> 54:17.208
-Not exactly.
-Let's go.

54:32.666 --> 54:33.958
Where we are going?

54:34.541 --> 54:36.458
My last basketball game
before the winter vacation.

54:36.666 --> 54:37.750
Do you want to come with me?

54:39.458 --> 54:40.458
Get on.

54:41.250 --> 54:42.500
Are you giving me a ride?

54:43.458 --> 54:44.333
Yes.

54:45.041 --> 54:47.958
It's too far away to walk.

54:49.500 --> 54:52.000
-People might get the wrong idea.
-Wrong idea?

54:53.708 --> 54:55.541
People will think we're in a relationship.

54:58.375 --> 54:59.625
When were we

55:00.041 --> 55:01.291
not in a relationship?

55:05.250 --> 55:06.291
Weiwei.

55:07.958 --> 55:08.958
Weiwei.

55:11.833 --> 55:12.791
Weiwei.

55:15.625 --> 55:17.083
Actually, I'm not a terrible driver.

55:17.208 --> 55:20.208
You don't have to look so scared.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.375
-Hello?
-Where are you?

55:40.625 --> 55:43.208
-It's still early.
-Hurry up. We're waiting for you.

55:43.333 --> 55:44.916
-I'm busy.
-With what?

55:45.250 --> 55:47.041
-A date.
-A date?

57:30.166 --> 57:31.791
ROOT FOR COMPUTER DEPARTMENT

57:36.041 --> 57:38.125
Students of the Architectural Department
are not convinced.

57:38.208 --> 57:40.333
I told them we'd definitely win the game

57:40.416 --> 57:42.666
-with Xiao Nai in court.
-Hey, Bei Weiwei. You're late.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.833
What are you doing here?
What about the interview?

57:46.041 --> 57:47.041
It’s over.

57:47.250 --> 57:48.708
So secretive.

57:48.833 --> 57:52.916
-Were you really at an interview?
-So many snacks!

57:55.125 --> 57:55.958
Awesome.

57:56.041 --> 58:01.625
I love to watch guys running, jumping,
sweating and bumping into each other.

58:01.958 --> 58:03.041
So cool!

58:03.791 --> 58:04.875
What are you looking at?

58:05.458 --> 58:08.833
I suggest you lose weight.

58:10.500 --> 58:12.916
It's a match between the Computer
and the Architectural Department.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.125
It's none of your business.

58:14.208 --> 58:16.791
Students from the Foreign Language
Department should be on holiday.

58:17.708 --> 58:19.750
Xiao Nai doesn't take a holiday,
so I don't either.

58:19.833 --> 58:20.833
Dummy.

58:24.583 --> 58:26.000
Master!

58:26.083 --> 58:28.083
-Xiao Nai!
-Xiao Nai!

58:28.166 --> 58:29.791
-Xiao Nai!
-Xiao Nai!

58:29.958 --> 58:31.250
-Xiao Nai!
-Sit down!

58:31.333 --> 58:32.708
-Xiao Nai!
-Sit down!

58:32.791 --> 58:35.583
-Xiao Nai!
-Sit down!

58:39.000 --> 58:40.500
So handsome!

58:40.708 --> 58:43.125
-I like him so much.
-Where is she? Is she here?

58:43.458 --> 58:45.208
I can see him.

58:45.333 --> 58:47.250
Who is Xiao Nai looking for?

58:47.333 --> 58:49.291
-Come on, Computer Department!
-Could he?

58:50.041 --> 58:51.833
Could he be looking for me?

58:52.041 --> 58:55.083
There are so many girls. Which one is it?

59:00.375 --> 59:01.583
He is looking at you!

59:12.666 --> 59:13.833
Don't take my snacks.

59:20.791 --> 59:24.291
-Go Computer Department!
-Go Computer Department!

59:24.375 --> 59:26.208
-Go Xiao Nai!
-Go Xiao Nai!

59:29.791 --> 59:31.166
Come on!

59:31.833 --> 59:35.666
-Come on!
-Come on!

59:36.708 --> 59:37.916
-Come on!
-Come on!

59:38.000 --> 59:40.291
-Come on!
-So handsome!

59:41.708 --> 59:43.375
-Come on!
-Come on!

59:43.458 --> 59:45.166
-Come on!
-Come on!

59:47.833 --> 59:49.750
-Come on!
-Come on!

59:51.583 --> 59:52.750
It's good!

59:55.458 --> 59:57.291
-Go Xiao Nai!
-Come on!

59:58.833 --> 59:59.958
-Come on!
-Come on!

1:00:00.041 --> 1:00:03.333
-Go Xiao Nai!
-Go Xiao Nai!

1:00:03.416 --> 1:00:04.958
-Go Xiao Nai!
-Go Xiao Nai!

1:00:05.041 --> 1:00:06.958
-Go Xiao Nai!
-Go Xiao Nai!

1:00:12.916 --> 1:00:14.375
Cool!

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:19.125
Xiao Nai!

1:00:23.041 --> 1:00:25.625
I heard that Xiao Nai
is even better at swimming.

1:00:26.375 --> 1:00:28.791
I really want to know
what he's like while swimming.

1:00:46.666 --> 1:00:48.625
Hey, why are you blushing?

1:00:50.208 --> 1:00:51.333
You're a pervert.

1:00:58.250 --> 1:00:59.958
Xiao Nai is so handsome!

1:01:04.166 --> 1:01:05.625
He's coming.

1:01:19.583 --> 1:01:20.875
Xiao Nai.

1:01:24.541 --> 1:01:28.125
We're going to eat later,
so I might not be online tonight.

1:01:30.875 --> 1:01:32.625
What are you doing tomorrow?

1:01:33.208 --> 1:01:34.250
Studying.

1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:37.708
I'm so stupid! Why did I say studying?

1:01:37.791 --> 1:01:38.833
The exams are over.

1:01:38.916 --> 1:01:42.041
Why didn't I say eating, sleeping,
watching movies or playing games?

1:01:43.375 --> 1:01:44.833
I'll go with you.

1:01:47.083 --> 1:01:48.166
There's a seat over there.

1:01:48.625 --> 1:01:50.666
Can you move further inside?

1:02:02.125 --> 1:02:03.000
Yiran!

1:02:03.958 --> 1:02:05.041
Yiran!

1:02:25.166 --> 1:02:26.791
Only two-points difference?

1:02:27.958 --> 1:02:28.958
Don't worry.

1:02:29.375 --> 1:02:32.750
When they stop watching the stands,
they'll get ahead again.

1:02:38.583 --> 1:02:40.375
Ask me anything you want.

1:02:41.041 --> 1:02:43.708
Unbelievable! We didn't know
you were in love with Xiao Nai!

1:02:43.791 --> 1:02:46.291
-Stand still. Seriously.
-Okay!

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:48.958
-Tell us.
-It wasn't my fault.

1:02:49.041 --> 1:02:50.250
I didn't know until today either.

1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:52.041
Do you think we're idiots?

1:02:52.125 --> 1:02:54.833
You were acting like you've been together
for more than six months.

1:02:54.916 --> 1:02:55.958
Who would believe you?

1:02:56.833 --> 1:02:58.041
-Go back.
-Hey.

1:02:58.125 --> 1:02:59.541
Come clean and we'll let you off.

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:00.583
Tell us properly.

1:03:02.833 --> 1:03:04.875
Actually, I have nothing to tell.

1:03:11.416 --> 1:03:13.750
I need ten minutes to explain
without interference.

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:17.041
-Speak.
-Speak.

1:03:18.416 --> 1:03:19.500
Here is the story.

1:03:20.083 --> 1:03:21.333
One day, several months ago,

1:03:21.875 --> 1:03:23.583
it was sunny and clear.

1:03:24.250 --> 1:03:27.250
I found a cockroach crawling right here

1:03:27.916 --> 1:03:29.958
-and then--
-Get to the point!

1:03:31.375 --> 1:03:32.958
Get to the point!

1:03:36.958 --> 1:03:39.125
Weiwei, you really...

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:41.666
What are the key points? Hurry!

1:03:44.583 --> 1:03:45.583
Xiao Nai.

1:03:45.791 --> 1:03:48.166
Am I the same as you imagined
how Luwei Weiwei would be?

1:03:51.083 --> 1:03:53.666
Is she the same as me?

1:03:54.708 --> 1:03:55.833
I didn't imagine you.

1:03:56.791 --> 1:03:58.166
You didn't?

1:04:02.041 --> 1:04:03.500
I've seen you before.

1:04:06.166 --> 1:04:08.375
I first saw you at the Internet cafe.

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.416
Make way! Sorry, it's an emergency!

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:16.291
I went there to surf the Internet,
and I was nearly hit by you.

1:04:16.833 --> 1:04:20.500
Suddenly, I wanted to know more about you.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:22.583
So I went into the cafe

1:04:22.916 --> 1:04:25.250
and saw you were playing Mengyou Jianghu.

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:27.708
On that day, you saved your group.

1:04:27.833 --> 1:04:29.416
-I'm coming.
-You're loyal to your friends,

1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:30.458
and have great skills.

1:04:30.791 --> 1:04:31.875
You're fast.

1:04:34.333 --> 1:04:36.708
So, you've known I was Luwei Weiwei
this whole time?

1:04:43.125 --> 1:04:43.958
Yes.

1:04:45.333 --> 1:04:46.708
Then, during Zhenshui's wedding,

1:04:46.833 --> 1:04:48.625
it looked like you were
going to ruin the wedding.

1:04:48.708 --> 1:04:51.541
You were in such a terrible situation,
but you're quick-witted.

1:04:52.041 --> 1:04:53.250
So, I...

1:04:55.708 --> 1:04:57.708
So, you proposed to me?

1:04:57.916 --> 1:04:58.875
Right.

1:05:00.916 --> 1:05:03.500
Wait, tell me more.

1:05:13.666 --> 1:05:14.583
This way.

1:05:23.541 --> 1:05:24.375
Please.

1:05:27.750 --> 1:05:30.458
This is my company. That's my seat.

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:42.958
Do you like it?

1:05:45.625 --> 1:05:46.750
It's awesome.

1:05:49.708 --> 1:05:51.083
You still have this?

1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.541
I played it when I was a kid.

1:06:00.166 --> 1:06:02.166
It's the same configuration
as before, right?

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.083
This is my first computer.

1:06:04.541 --> 1:06:05.458
I have more.

1:06:09.750 --> 1:06:11.666
-Does it still work?
-Yes, of course.

1:06:15.666 --> 1:06:17.041
Are you brave enough to challenge me?

1:06:41.541 --> 1:06:42.958
You really love games, don't you?

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:45.375
They've kept me company
since my childhood.

1:06:46.125 --> 1:06:49.875
So, I hope someday, I can design a game
to keep other kids company.

1:06:51.333 --> 1:06:52.375
Weiwei, look.

1:06:54.541 --> 1:06:56.500
It's the conceptual design of our game.

1:06:58.125 --> 1:06:59.500
And these are the scene designs.

1:06:59.750 --> 1:07:01.875
Weiwei, come here.

1:07:01.958 --> 1:07:03.250
GAME SETTING

1:07:06.541 --> 1:07:08.000
This is the original design for the boss.

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.958
We call it Smart City.

1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:18.125
What do you think about the name?

1:07:23.875 --> 1:07:24.916
What?

1:07:29.625 --> 1:07:30.666
I just feel...

1:07:31.666 --> 1:07:33.250
like nothing's real.

1:07:33.916 --> 1:07:37.125
Before we met yesterday,
we were only strangers.

1:07:38.666 --> 1:07:41.041
How can we be so familiar already?

1:07:48.083 --> 1:07:49.791
I didn't think it would be this fast too.

1:07:50.541 --> 1:07:52.291
Do you think it's real now?

1:07:57.708 --> 1:07:59.208
-Continue. We didn't see anything.
-Don't.

1:07:59.291 --> 1:08:00.333
Let us introduce ourselves.

1:08:05.916 --> 1:08:07.750
Hello, I'm Weiwei.

1:08:08.416 --> 1:08:09.958
I know. Bei Weiwei, right?

1:08:10.041 --> 1:08:10.916
You're our junior.

1:08:11.041 --> 1:08:12.041
Houzijiu.

1:08:12.375 --> 1:08:13.250
Yugong.

1:08:13.958 --> 1:08:15.000
Mozhata.

1:08:15.958 --> 1:08:17.750
-I'm Luwei Weiwei.
-What?

1:08:17.833 --> 1:08:18.958
Luwei Weiwei?

1:08:19.375 --> 1:08:21.166
Bei Weiwei is Luwei Weiwei?

1:08:21.250 --> 1:08:23.041
So, you're not really
a guy playing as a female!

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.166
-Hello!
-Hello!

1:08:30.250 --> 1:08:32.041
-Weiwei?
-Diemeng.

1:08:32.125 --> 1:08:34.208
Are you free this weekend?
Let’s get together.

1:08:34.375 --> 1:08:35.375
Sure.

1:08:35.916 --> 1:08:38.500
We're members of the Blue Sea Tide Clan.
We've been through it all.

1:08:39.125 --> 1:08:40.916
-I'm Zhantianxia.
-Zhantianxia.

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.291
This is my wife, Diemeng.

1:08:43.708 --> 1:08:46.458
-Hi, everyone. I'm Lanzhimeng.
-Lanzhimeng.

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.125
-I'm Dalang Taosha.
-Who stole my equipment.

1:08:49.750 --> 1:08:52.000
-Xiaoyu Mianmian.
-Lieyao Daozu.

1:08:54.416 --> 1:08:55.875
I'm Lieshe Xianren.

1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.458
-I'm Zhenshui Wuxiang.
-Leader!

1:08:59.541 --> 1:09:00.791
-Great!
-So handsome.

1:09:00.875 --> 1:09:02.750
Hello! I'm Xiaoyu Yaoyao.

1:09:02.958 --> 1:09:05.458
-I've seen your picture.
-The beauty of Jianghu.

1:09:05.541 --> 1:09:07.125
Looks prettier than her photos.

1:09:07.666 --> 1:09:11.166
Diemeng, is everybody here? Let's toast.

1:09:12.916 --> 1:09:14.125
Wait, well...

1:09:14.333 --> 1:09:17.166
Hushuilan and Hanyan aren't here yet.

1:09:17.416 --> 1:09:18.583
And Luwei Weiwei.

1:09:18.666 --> 1:09:20.666
Isn't this a party just for clan members?

1:09:20.750 --> 1:09:24.083
-Why would you invite an outsider?
-She's not an outsider.

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:27.291
She was a part of the clan
before most of us.

1:09:27.625 --> 1:09:29.916
I know there was a misunderstanding
between us.

1:09:30.375 --> 1:09:33.291
In any case, we're going abroad soon,

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:35.458
and we wanted to see her once
before we go.

1:09:35.541 --> 1:09:36.375
Fine.

1:09:36.791 --> 1:09:39.250
It will be good for me to see my ex-wife.

1:09:39.416 --> 1:09:40.708
See what she looks like.

1:09:42.708 --> 1:09:44.875
In Mengyou Jianghu,
it's rumored that Luwei Weiwei is a guy.

1:09:44.958 --> 1:09:47.666
-I don't know if it's true or not.
-You'll know later.

1:09:47.791 --> 1:09:48.958
Hello, everyone!

1:09:49.250 --> 1:09:51.916
-Are you a guy playing as a female?
-Who's a guy playing as a female?

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.125
-That's Hushuilan.
-I'm Hanyan.

1:09:54.708 --> 1:09:56.416
-So you're Hanyan.
-Hanyan.

1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:58.916
-Here, have a seat.
-Sit down.

1:09:59.083 --> 1:10:01.625
-Have a seat.
-It's you.

1:10:02.291 --> 1:10:04.166
Sorry, I'm late.

1:10:05.708 --> 1:10:07.833
-Weiwei?
-Cao Guang?

1:10:08.375 --> 1:10:12.125
-Are you Luwei Weiwei?
-And you are?

1:10:14.750 --> 1:10:16.166
He's Zhenshui Wuxiang.

1:10:18.208 --> 1:10:19.416
It's a small world.

1:10:19.500 --> 1:10:20.916
-Weiwei.
-Diemeng.

1:10:21.250 --> 1:10:23.166
That's right. Come here, don't stay there.

1:10:24.166 --> 1:10:25.833
Everybody is here. Let's toast.

1:10:25.916 --> 1:10:27.916
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much!

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.625
-Thanks!
-Have a great trip!

1:10:38.208 --> 1:10:39.625
-Come and take a seat here.
-Okay.

1:10:39.708 --> 1:10:41.041
-Let's sit.
-Today, we...

1:10:41.125 --> 1:10:42.875
-You're going abroad so soon?
-Take this.

1:10:42.958 --> 1:10:44.333
-Yes.
-Right.

1:10:45.333 --> 1:10:48.583
Weiwei, I don't know
when I'll see you again.

1:10:48.708 --> 1:10:49.833
I'll wait for you to come back.

1:10:50.375 --> 1:10:51.375
Okay.

1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:53.250
Can you access the server
from outside the country?

1:10:53.333 --> 1:10:56.250
-Let's have a battle soon.
-Sure. Depends on the technology.

1:10:56.708 --> 1:10:57.958
I might be a little stuck.

1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:00.250
-Let's go. Bye!
-Bye.

1:11:03.125 --> 1:11:05.375
-I'm leaving.
-No one is coming to pick you up?

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.166
Weiwei, let me take you home.

1:11:09.291 --> 1:11:10.666
It's okay. Thank you.

1:11:22.166 --> 1:11:24.833
Weiwei, sorry that I'm late.

1:11:26.416 --> 1:11:27.416
Why are you here?

1:11:28.250 --> 1:11:30.375
It's normal for a boyfriend
to pick up his girlfriend, right?

1:11:31.375 --> 1:11:33.166
-Let's go.
-Xiao Nai.

1:11:35.625 --> 1:11:37.291
-I'm leaving. Bye.
-Bye.

1:11:39.625 --> 1:11:40.791
Hey, handsome!

1:11:40.875 --> 1:11:44.208
Do you know that your girl
has married before in the game?

1:11:53.166 --> 1:11:56.541
She cheats other players
and flirts around.

1:11:56.625 --> 1:11:59.708
She has a bad reputation
and everybody knows that.

1:11:59.875 --> 1:12:02.875
-Don't be cheated by her.
-As long as she wants to be with me,

1:12:03.916 --> 1:12:05.375
I don't care about those things.

1:12:07.916 --> 1:12:08.958
Let’s go.

1:12:16.958 --> 1:12:17.958
The rain has stopped.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:19.333
Right.

1:12:19.916 --> 1:12:22.208
Maybe you've pissed off Xiaoyu Yaoyao,
the Rain Demon.

1:12:22.291 --> 1:12:25.416
I've discovered that you're better at
pissing people off than I am.

1:12:26.750 --> 1:12:27.583
That's flattering.

1:12:28.750 --> 1:12:31.833
If I really did all that,
you don't mind, right?

1:12:35.041 --> 1:12:35.958
No.

1:12:36.583 --> 1:12:39.833
If you go outside the wall an inch,

1:12:40.333 --> 1:12:41.458
I'll move the wall an inch.

1:12:42.291 --> 1:12:43.458
If you go outside a foot,

1:12:44.250 --> 1:12:45.291
I'll move it ten feet.

1:12:50.916 --> 1:12:54.083
Weiwei, this is the first time
I've been with a girl.

1:12:55.041 --> 1:12:57.666
Most of the time, I don't know what to do.

1:12:58.916 --> 1:12:59.833
But at least,

1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:03.333
what others can do, I can do too.

1:13:20.166 --> 1:13:21.916
So you guys are not going back
to your hometown?

1:13:22.666 --> 1:13:24.958
Why is Youjing Company still working
during the New Year's?

1:13:25.958 --> 1:13:27.208
That's right, we can't go home.

1:13:28.333 --> 1:13:32.083
If our proposal is approved tomorrow,
we'll start working on the game.

1:13:32.250 --> 1:13:33.333
It'll be a race against time.

1:13:34.291 --> 1:13:36.375
After all, the launch date has been set.

1:13:39.541 --> 1:13:41.750
I'm worried about where you'll eat
for your New Year's dinner.

1:13:42.083 --> 1:13:43.541
-What?
-New Year's dinner.

1:13:43.625 --> 1:13:45.458
You have to find a good restaurant.

1:13:48.083 --> 1:13:50.000
I'll eat at the Internet cafe that night.

1:13:59.583 --> 1:14:01.291
I didn't mean to book
such an early ticket.

1:14:03.166 --> 1:14:04.916
When the university booked
the tickets for us,

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.416
we didn't know each other yet.

1:14:14.208 --> 1:14:15.083
I hate it.

1:14:15.833 --> 1:14:17.333
I don't want to part with you.

1:14:18.458 --> 1:14:19.791
Me neither.

1:14:29.041 --> 1:14:30.250
Call me when you get home.

1:14:31.125 --> 1:14:32.041
Okay.

1:14:40.875 --> 1:14:42.416
I'll be waiting
for your good news tomorrow.

1:14:49.916 --> 1:14:52.375
This is when we dim
the background of the game.

1:14:52.500 --> 1:14:55.958
And set the story
in a fictitious mythical world.

1:14:56.333 --> 1:15:02.333
In that world, many interesting,
fierce and new monsters will appear.

1:15:03.041 --> 1:15:08.458
And our boss and NPC system
will satisfy our players,

1:15:09.125 --> 1:15:12.916
but at the same time, our Battle Mode
will provide a great degree of freedom.

1:15:13.583 --> 1:15:15.791
This guarantees to give players
the best user experience.

1:15:16.625 --> 1:15:18.708
During the research and development,

1:15:18.833 --> 1:15:22.750
our entire creative team
has been thinking about one problem.

1:15:23.208 --> 1:15:24.875
What's the biggest difference between

1:15:24.958 --> 1:15:27.416
-standalone games and online games?
-Mr. Li.

1:15:27.833 --> 1:15:29.208
This was our idea.

1:15:30.041 --> 1:15:33.166
This isn't Dreamland Space II.
But this is our game, Smart City.

1:15:33.250 --> 1:15:34.833
You've copied us!

1:15:34.958 --> 1:15:37.791
It's not just the overall idea, but the
character design and style are the same.

1:15:38.166 --> 1:15:39.666
How have we copied you?

1:15:40.458 --> 1:15:43.666
First of all, the game is called
Dreamland Space II.

1:15:43.833 --> 1:15:46.541
Secondly, it's developed
by the Dreamland Space Company.

1:15:46.916 --> 1:15:49.791
If it has any relation to your game,

1:15:50.333 --> 1:15:52.833
we really want to thank you
for inspiring us.

1:15:52.916 --> 1:15:53.958
Thank you so much!

1:15:54.958 --> 1:15:55.958
My friends.

1:15:56.541 --> 1:16:00.083
I'm surprised that
our worldview is so similar.

1:16:00.666 --> 1:16:01.666
It must be fate.

1:16:02.041 --> 1:16:04.208
So, on behalf of our company,

1:16:04.291 --> 1:16:07.208
I want to invite you to join
our research and development team.

1:16:08.791 --> 1:16:09.791
It's 500,000 yuan per year.

1:16:09.875 --> 1:16:11.750
When the project is finished,
you'll get a bonus.

1:16:11.958 --> 1:16:13.541
This is an honest offer.

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:16.083
Welcome to the team.

1:16:18.166 --> 1:16:19.541
-I'll kick your ass, liar!
-Hey!

1:16:19.916 --> 1:16:21.458
You can't get away with this, old man.

1:16:21.541 --> 1:16:22.500
Stop!

1:16:30.625 --> 1:16:31.833
You liars.

1:16:33.041 --> 1:16:34.625
You can only trick us once.

1:18:08.291 --> 1:18:09.333
Happy New Year!

1:18:21.041 --> 1:18:22.541
-Weiwei.
-Xiao Nai.

1:18:22.958 --> 1:18:24.250
Happy New Year!

1:18:24.958 --> 1:18:26.541
Where are you eating for dinner tonight?

1:18:28.291 --> 1:18:29.750
Houzijiu booked a restaurant.

1:18:30.458 --> 1:18:33.166
-Are you there now?
-Yes.

1:18:34.250 --> 1:18:35.833
Really? Why is it so quiet?

1:18:37.541 --> 1:18:38.625
We booked a private room.

1:18:38.875 --> 1:18:41.291
-Looks like Youjing is treating you well.
-Weiwei.

1:18:41.583 --> 1:18:43.916
-It's dinner time!
-Have you started eating?

1:18:44.083 --> 1:18:45.833
No. My mom is cooking.

1:18:45.958 --> 1:18:47.750
I'm making a salad right now.

1:18:47.833 --> 1:18:49.500
-I'll make it for you next time.
-What are you looking for?

1:18:49.583 --> 1:18:50.458
Seafood ramen,

1:18:51.875 --> 1:18:52.833
sea salt lemonade

1:18:53.541 --> 1:18:56.750
-and ham sausage.
-What kind of food are you having?

1:18:56.833 --> 1:18:58.291
Stop kidding around!

1:18:58.458 --> 1:18:59.583
New Year's food.

1:19:00.958 --> 1:19:02.916
I'm eating...

1:19:04.416 --> 1:19:08.958
sour soup fish, steamed mandarin fish,
three cup chicken and hairy crab.

1:19:09.041 --> 1:19:12.291
We also have steamed fish, squid balls,
Dungeness crab and seafood soup.

1:19:12.375 --> 1:19:14.875
-Weiwei, set the table for your mom.
-Okay.

1:19:15.666 --> 1:19:21.208
We have Sichuan poached pork, spring
bullfrog and Sichuan toothpick beef.

1:19:21.625 --> 1:19:25.666
We have scrambled eggs, sautéed shrimp,
kidney beans and dumplings.

1:19:26.083 --> 1:19:27.958
We also have Dongpo pork,

1:19:28.041 --> 1:19:30.541
-and Japanese roast fish.
-Weiwei, who is it?

1:19:30.833 --> 1:19:32.000
Gosh, Mom!

1:19:33.416 --> 1:19:35.208
-Go.
-Hurry up.

1:19:36.916 --> 1:19:39.875
It's just that I wanted to spend
the New Year with you.

1:19:40.125 --> 1:19:41.833
Weiwei, it's dinner time!

1:19:42.375 --> 1:19:43.458
Okay.

1:19:44.791 --> 1:19:46.250
My mom is calling me for dinner.

1:19:46.666 --> 1:19:47.708
Let's talk later.

1:19:49.166 --> 1:19:50.833
Okay, go ahead.

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.875
-The dumplings are ready!
-Let's eat!

1:19:56.541 --> 1:19:58.125
-Come.
-Sir.

1:19:58.208 --> 1:20:00.208
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

1:20:00.875 --> 1:20:04.208
-Happy New Year!
-Welcome home!

1:20:09.416 --> 1:20:11.041
You're the best cook, Mom!

1:20:11.708 --> 1:20:14.583
-Weiwei, have another shrimp.
-Dad, I'm full.

1:20:14.791 --> 1:20:16.833
Stop saying that.
You're too skinny. Eat more.

1:20:16.916 --> 1:20:17.791
No, I'm not that skinny.

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:19.708
Dear, do as you're told.

1:20:19.833 --> 1:20:21.541
Eat more. Let me peel you a shrimp.

1:20:21.625 --> 1:20:22.791
WEIWEI, COME TO MENGYOU JIANGHU!

1:20:23.208 --> 1:20:24.958
I'm full. I'm going to my room.

1:20:25.250 --> 1:20:27.791
-The countdown is about to begin.
-I know.

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:31.083
Hey.

1:20:31.583 --> 1:20:33.583
Is Weiwei in love?

1:20:55.375 --> 1:20:57.250
YIXIAO NAIHE IS LETTING OFF FIREWORKS
AT CHANG'AN CITY

1:21:48.041 --> 1:21:50.833
Xiao Nai, this is the best
New Year's present ever.

1:22:26.750 --> 1:22:29.416
YIXIAO NAIHE IS LETTING OFF FIREWORKS
AT CHANG'AN CITY

1:22:29.875 --> 1:22:32.375
Weiwei, Happy New Year!

1:22:45.416 --> 1:22:47.166
Hey!

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:49.083
What's keeping you?

1:22:49.583 --> 1:22:50.875
Happy New Year!

1:22:53.708 --> 1:22:55.291
Why aren't you saying anything?

1:22:57.583 --> 1:22:59.250
Is something wrong?

1:23:07.250 --> 1:23:08.916
Youjing Company deceived us.

1:23:09.708 --> 1:23:11.541
Xiao Nai is at the university on his own.

1:23:12.208 --> 1:23:13.708
We went home for New Year.

1:23:25.250 --> 1:23:26.375
Xiao Nai!

1:23:27.625 --> 1:23:29.458
Xiao Nai!

1:23:31.750 --> 1:23:34.583
Xiao Nai, come out!

1:23:36.875 --> 1:23:38.833
Xiao Nai, come out!

1:23:42.625 --> 1:23:44.208
Xiao Nai!

1:24:42.458 --> 1:24:44.791
How did you get here? By plane or train?

1:24:44.916 --> 1:24:47.291
I have no money for a plane ticket.
I took the train.

1:24:49.041 --> 1:24:50.250
What should we eat?

1:24:50.333 --> 1:24:53.208
It's so cold. Let's eat hot pot.

1:24:53.416 --> 1:24:55.041
-Yes, let's do it.
-Right.

1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.333
We haven't fought the boss for a while.
Let's play one game.

1:26:33.458 --> 1:26:34.833
-Okay.
-Okay!

1:26:34.916 --> 1:26:35.791
Sure!

1:26:45.833 --> 1:26:46.791
MENGYOU JIANGHU

1:26:52.833 --> 1:26:53.958
What is this place?

1:26:54.750 --> 1:26:56.958
There's no way through! Is this the end?

1:26:57.041 --> 1:26:59.375
Right, here is the end of the world.

1:26:59.916 --> 1:27:01.041
Where's the boss?

1:27:01.333 --> 1:27:04.333
-Where's the boss?
-Where is it?

1:27:14.083 --> 1:27:15.625
Sure enough, there's the boss.

1:27:16.166 --> 1:27:17.416
Awesome!

1:27:26.708 --> 1:27:27.750
Hold your ground!

1:27:29.416 --> 1:27:30.416
Be careful!

1:27:31.416 --> 1:27:32.333
Be careful!

1:27:35.250 --> 1:27:36.291
Get in position!

1:27:55.666 --> 1:27:57.333
-Attack!
-Okay!

1:28:00.291 --> 1:28:02.041
Xiao Nai, be careful!

1:28:20.083 --> 1:28:22.916
-It's tight. Defend your positions.
-Okay!

1:29:02.083 --> 1:29:03.291
Xiao Nai, come on!

1:29:38.083 --> 1:29:39.250
You made me trip!

1:29:39.375 --> 1:29:41.791
I am Bei Weiwei!

1:29:43.458 --> 1:29:45.458
I am Xiao Nai!

1:29:46.125 --> 1:29:48.958
I am Yu Banshan!

1:29:49.166 --> 1:29:52.250
I am Qiu Yonghou!

1:29:52.333 --> 1:29:53.958
I am Hao Mei!

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.708
Hey, guys! Why do you love playing games?

1:29:58.791 --> 1:30:00.583
Because I love fighting bosses!

1:30:01.083 --> 1:30:04.041
I love role-playing games because
I love being a warrior and a master.

1:30:04.125 --> 1:30:07.250
It's a type of fantasy
that you can't experience in reality.

1:30:07.333 --> 1:30:08.208
That's right.

1:30:08.291 --> 1:30:10.958
To me, the game world
is a brand new world.

1:30:11.041 --> 1:30:15.708
I can do everything I want there
and I can meet interesting friends.

1:30:15.791 --> 1:30:17.291
Like all of you.

1:30:18.333 --> 1:30:19.416
In games,

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:24.583
we can find the most real,
beautiful and exciting world.

1:30:25.208 --> 1:30:27.666
-Let's make a new game.
-Okay!

1:30:27.958 --> 1:30:29.291
Let's make a new game.

1:30:29.375 --> 1:30:31.041
-New game!
-Make a new game!

1:30:31.125 --> 1:30:32.958
-Make a new game!
-New game!

1:30:33.041 --> 1:30:36.833
-Make a new game!
-New game!

1:30:42.458 --> 1:30:44.291
SMART CITY

1:30:44.375 --> 1:30:46.000
PING AN PUHUI BANK LOANS

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:49.583
THE 300,000 YUAN HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED
TO YOUR ACCOUNT

1:30:51.500 --> 1:30:52.333
Thank you!

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.375
Who are you looking for?

1:30:56.833 --> 1:30:57.791
KO!

1:30:59.541 --> 1:31:03.125
-Why are you here?
-I heard you need some help. Can I help?

1:31:36.875 --> 1:31:38.458
Today, we're not talking
about tournaments.

1:31:38.541 --> 1:31:40.583
We're talking about a popular new game
called Young Game.

1:31:40.666 --> 1:31:43.583
Frankly, it's not a finished game yet.

1:31:43.666 --> 1:31:46.458
It's just a demo,
but it's very popular recently.

1:31:46.541 --> 1:31:48.166
I heard it was developed by students.

1:31:48.250 --> 1:31:50.791
-The worldview and boss just came online.
-Right.

1:31:50.875 --> 1:31:53.625
Although it's simple,
Young Game has a great sense of identity.

1:31:53.708 --> 1:31:55.083
It has a very realistic feel to it.

1:31:55.208 --> 1:31:57.208
I love the natural rhythm.

1:31:57.291 --> 1:31:59.541
It's an intense experience,
but with a great climax.

1:31:59.625 --> 1:32:01.916
-Climax?
-Yes! I'm looking forward to it.

1:32:02.208 --> 1:32:04.916
-I'm Rookie.
-We are the IG squadron.

1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:07.750
-I'm Ruofeng. We are...
-The Panda TV squadron!

1:32:07.833 --> 1:32:09.916
Have you played any new games recently?

1:32:10.375 --> 1:32:13.625
I've seen a video recently.
It's very popular on the Internet.

1:32:13.708 --> 1:32:14.875
It was only a few minutes long.

1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:16.958
-Young Game, right?
-Yes, Young Game!

1:32:17.166 --> 1:32:20.625
The best thing about the game
is its interesting special effects.

1:32:20.791 --> 1:32:23.583
I hope that it's done as soon as possible.
Then, we can play it together.

1:32:23.666 --> 1:32:25.458
Yes, it'll be really fun.

1:32:25.541 --> 1:32:27.208
Yes! I'm looking forward to it.

1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:30.416
Xiao Nai!

1:32:35.083 --> 1:32:36.625
Hello, I'm Wang Sicong.

1:32:37.333 --> 1:32:38.625
I'm a big fan.

1:32:39.125 --> 1:32:40.416
I love Young Game very much

1:32:40.750 --> 1:32:43.458
and I hope I can join you guys
to help make Young Game.

1:32:43.541 --> 1:32:44.416
Welcome!

1:32:45.375 --> 1:32:47.375
-Let's work together.
-Okay!

1:32:50.458 --> 1:32:52.750
Here we are at the launch of Young Game.

1:32:52.958 --> 1:32:55.250
We can see that
the atmosphere is fantastic.

1:32:55.416 --> 1:32:58.833
The world needs heroes.
Games need innovation.

1:32:59.083 --> 1:33:02.666
The latest version of Young Game took
four years of research and development.

1:33:02.750 --> 1:33:07.333
After going through multiple betas,
it's finally here.

1:33:07.583 --> 1:33:10.958
I, myself am very excited.
I'm looking forward to it.

1:33:11.166 --> 1:33:14.625
For Xiao Nai and Bei Weiwei,
their startup story inspires people

1:33:14.708 --> 1:33:18.291
and is something people can aspire from.

1:33:18.375 --> 1:33:21.791
Okay. Let's get back to the launch party.
We can see the launch party now.

1:33:28.250 --> 1:33:29.250
This is great!

1:33:30.666 --> 1:33:31.583
Yes.

1:33:32.916 --> 1:33:36.166
I heard that our game had a great impact
on Mengyou Jianghu when it launched.

1:33:37.625 --> 1:33:38.541
Maybe.

1:33:38.958 --> 1:33:41.083
But I believe
Mengyou Jianghu will survive.

1:33:42.500 --> 1:33:44.375
After all, it has us.

1:33:44.750 --> 1:33:45.791
We prefer here.

1:33:46.250 --> 1:33:47.458
We like it here.

1:33:49.291 --> 1:33:51.041
I really want to play
Mengyou Jianghu again.

1:33:52.875 --> 1:33:53.791
I do, too.

1:33:55.458 --> 1:33:57.666
I haven't been to Sunset Peak
for a long time.

1:34:02.791 --> 1:34:05.125
-Let's go.
-It is my honor to announce

1:34:05.416 --> 1:34:09.166
that the Young Game launch party
is about to start!

1:34:09.333 --> 1:34:12.541
-Sir!
-Sir!

1:34:12.666 --> 1:34:15.291
-Sir!
-Hello, I am Wang Sicong.

1:34:16.416 --> 1:34:18.958
Like everyone else,
I've loved games since my childhood.

1:34:19.041 --> 1:34:23.375
Bei Weiwei and Xiao Nai have said before
that in games, we can do whatever we want,

1:34:23.583 --> 1:34:25.291
meet even more interesting people.

1:34:25.625 --> 1:34:28.666
Compared to the real world,
the game is more real,

1:34:29.041 --> 1:34:32.125
and games are more beautiful and exciting.

1:34:32.333 --> 1:34:34.416
Young Game is such a new world.

1:34:34.625 --> 1:34:35.958
I can't wait.

1:34:52.416 --> 1:34:55.291
The moment we've been waiting for
is right now.

1:34:55.375 --> 1:34:57.708
Please turn around. Watch the big screen!

1:34:59.791 --> 1:35:01.333
Let's count down.

1:35:01.416 --> 1:35:02.625
-Ten!
-Ten!

1:35:03.166 --> 1:35:04.416
-Nine!
-Nine!

1:35:04.875 --> 1:35:06.250
-Eight!
-Eight!

1:35:06.791 --> 1:35:08.041
-Seven!
-Seven!

1:35:08.583 --> 1:35:09.666
-Six!
-Six!

1:35:09.958 --> 1:35:11.208
-Five!
-Five!

1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:12.791
-Four!
-Four!

1:35:13.250 --> 1:35:16.500
-Three, two, one!
-Three, two, one!

1:35:41.208 --> 1:35:42.583
Congratulations!

1:35:43.291 --> 1:35:44.708
Congratulations!

1:36:14.375 --> 1:36:16.416
Even if the game is shut down someday,

1:36:16.708 --> 1:36:18.541
the things we have seen together

1:36:18.708 --> 1:36:20.041
and the things we have done together,

1:36:20.541 --> 1:36:24.208
the memories will never fade away.

1:36:24.583 --> 1:36:26.166
I'll remember it forever.

1:36:26.583 --> 1:36:27.500
What about you?

1:36:28.833 --> 1:36:32.166
We'll bring our child here someday.

1:36:33.541 --> 1:36:34.458
Child?

1:36:34.916 --> 1:36:36.000
I'll show him...

1:36:37.208 --> 1:36:39.291
where we said
our first words to each other.

1:36:41.166 --> 1:36:43.375
If I had known I would love you this much,

1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.833
I would have fallen in love
at first sight.

1:37:25.708 --> 1:37:28.250
-I have an affair in an online game.
-With who?

1:37:28.333 --> 1:37:30.625
-I haven't heard about this.
-It's not in Mengyou Jianghu.

1:37:30.708 --> 1:37:32.958
It's in Spore. I'm called Tianyi.

1:37:33.041 --> 1:37:34.875
-A female character?
-I play as a female character

1:37:34.958 --> 1:37:36.958
because I wanted to find
a great woman to partner with.

1:37:38.125 --> 1:37:40.166
He's a guy playing a female character.

1:37:40.375 --> 1:37:41.958
I found someone with a very poetic name.

1:37:42.375 --> 1:37:44.958
At first, I thought it was a girl.
Her name was Shoukezhao Xingchen.

1:37:45.708 --> 1:37:47.625
After a month,
I started having feelings for her.

1:37:47.708 --> 1:37:49.958
It turned out that the character
was a guy.

1:37:51.250 --> 1:37:55.083
-Is your server Chang'an Yuexia?
-How did you know?

1:37:55.333 --> 1:37:56.291
My beauty.

1:37:56.625 --> 1:37:58.916
I'm Shoukezhao Xingchen.
