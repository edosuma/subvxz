18:19.348 --> 18:21.183
If I don't know what Chloe's done,

18:21.266 --> 18:24.686
it means I don't lose hours of my life
getting into it with your dad.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.605
But if I don't know what Chloe's done,

18:26.688 --> 18:28.774
I'm basically admitting
that I'm not a good mom,

18:28.857 --> 18:31.360
which makes him the better... parent.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.154

but she quit

-Not... I mean--
-Super duper, duper hard.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.688
Like, virtually impossible, like...

26:46.771 --> 26:47.814
Illuminati level.

26:47.897 --> 26:51.067
Yes. It's hard. It's--
Yeah, it was an application.

26:51.151 --> 26:55.071
Anyway, what were you saying about
your tiny, tiny house with no electricity?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.074
It's who I am. [giggles] 

26:58.783 --> 27:00.660
Anyway, you guys were talking about
taking a trip somewhere?

27:00.744 --> 27:01.578
Yes.

27:01.911 --> 27:03.622
Yes, we're gonna take a nice, long,

27:03.705 --> 27:06.791
relaxing, emissions-free drive
up the coast to San Fran.

27:07.334 --> 27:08.960
John bought a Volt. Pre-owned.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.211
A-- A Volp?

27:11.087 --> 27:12.255
-Volt.
-Volt.

27:12.339 --> 27:15.258
It's a electric car.
You don't worry. You'll never see one.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.509
Like a Tesla?

27:16.593 --> 27:18.803
Uh, no. It's in the family.

27:19.220 --> 27:23.433
But our therapist said that the open road
can be a great release for a relationship.

27:23.516 --> 27:26.144
[laughing] Oh, my God,
are you having marital problems?

27:26.895 --> 27:29.356
[stammering] I'm sorry,
I-- I meant, that's--

27:29.439 --> 27:32.192
That sounds rough. I'm sorry.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.111
Thanks, but we're gonna be okay.
I believe in us.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.947
Plus, we're just adding anal
to the repertoire, so...

27:38.031 --> 27:38.865
[Kenya] Whoa. 

27:38.948 --> 27:39.908
[Joya clears throat] 

27:41.284 --> 27:42.327
That's always good.

27:43.119 --> 27:44.245
So, um...

27:44.329 --> 27:47.123
San Francisco's supposed to be great.

27:47.582 --> 27:49.125
Yes. San Francisco, right.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.378
Uh, yeah, should be a good time.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.171
In fact, I don't know
what you're doing this weekend,

27:53.254 --> 27:56.216
but the Bay is supposed to be beautiful
at this time of year.

27:56.299 --> 27:58.343
-I can imagine.
-Yeah, in fact, on Saturday night,

27:58.426 --> 28:00.136
the Warriors are having this family fest.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.930
Oh, I fuck with G State.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.765
Tickets, two-for-one,

28:03.848 --> 28:06.309
and unlimited beverages
as long as you bring your own Thermos.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.561
Wow! That's a real steal.

28:08.645 --> 28:12.107
So, hold on, I have to bring a Thermos
to a game?

28:12.190 --> 28:13.775
-[John] Yeah.
-You don't have to do anything.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.486
[Kara] I don't think this trip
is really their speed.

28:16.569 --> 28:20.615
We're gonna be camping under the stars,
just outside the city all weekend.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.201
Well, it's not-- It's more like glamping.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.662
Oh, glamping. I fuck with glamping.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.665
You fuck with glamping?
When have you fucked with glamping?

28:28.748 --> 28:31.376
I'm just saying
it's glamorous camping, right?

28:31.459 --> 28:33.628
[John] Yes!
Hey, if you two are interested,

28:33.712 --> 28:35.630
I bet there's still
a couple yurts available.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.091
-Yurts?
-Yurt? Spell that.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.009
It's like a tent, you know?

28:40.093 --> 28:41.970
Oh. Just say "tent."

28:42.053 --> 28:43.805
[Kara] But the correct way is "yurt."

28:43.888 --> 28:46.558
It's disrespectful to, uh, certain people.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.060
-Who?
-Um, aboriginal, I believe.

28:49.269 --> 28:52.689
You're just going to an aboriginal
San Franciscan camping trip?

28:52.772 --> 28:53.732
Yeah. [laughs]

28:53.815 --> 28:54.941
[cell phone ringing]

28:55.024 --> 28:57.861
Oh! This is my daughter calling
from USC film school.

28:57.944 --> 29:00.905
I don't know if you've heard of it?
They call it the Harvard of the West.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.198
I think that's Stanford.

29:02.657 --> 29:03.908
It's totally Stanford.

29:04.325 --> 29:05.744
-Hi, babe!
<i>-</i>[Chloe] <i>Hey, Mom.</i>

29:05.827 --> 29:08.413
-I need to speak to her.
<i>-No, I don't want to talk to him.</i>

29:08.496 --> 29:10.999
-She doesn't-- Please don't do this now.
-Don't give a fuck. I don't care.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.293
Do you want books?
Do you want tuition?

29:13.376 --> 29:14.836
[John] She's really grown up. Hey!

29:14.919 --> 29:18.214
Look at that hair! Purple? [laughs]

29:18.548 --> 29:20.884
Jo, you're one of those cool moms, huh?

29:20.967 --> 29:23.678
-So hip-hop, girl.
-Lit!

29:23.762 --> 29:24.888
-Litty.
-Litty!

29:24.971 --> 29:26.973
-[Kara chuckling]
-[mocking] Litty.

29:27.056 --> 29:28.141
<i>I'm gonna go.</i>

29:30.894 --> 29:32.395
So hip-hop, huh?

29:32.687 --> 29:34.439
What... what do you mean by that?

29:35.231 --> 29:37.108
I just-- You know, that she's, like...

29:38.568 --> 29:41.780
super trendy, you know,
like Jay-Z, or like Cardi B.

29:41.863 --> 29:46.201
Oh, I love Cardi B.
Oh, my God, that song with Maroon 5.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.327
[Kenya] Mm.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.662
There it was. Fresh, pure, uncut,

29:49.746 --> 29:52.791
straight off the boat, nose bleed
in the greatest night of your life

29:53.124 --> 29:54.542
White Gaze.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.085
You were right.

29:56.461 --> 29:57.420
Thanks, babe.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.923
Racism. Bet on it.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.593
You know that Cardi B
is, like, super successful.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.178
No, yeah. She's so fun.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.596
Okurrr! [laughs] 

30:06.679 --> 30:07.764
By "so fun" do you mean

30:07.847 --> 30:11.017
she literally ended
the government shutdown with one tweet?

30:11.434 --> 30:13.895
By "so fun" do you mean
the first female rapper

30:13.978 --> 30:17.565
to reach number one
on the Billboard Hot 100 and win a Grammy?

30:17.649 --> 30:20.443
-You guys know a lot about Cardi B.
-It's a lot.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.070
[Kenya and Joya] She's so fun!

30:22.695 --> 30:24.823
You guys also know a lot
about purple hair.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.325
[Joya] For future reference,

30:27.450 --> 30:31.037
I have no interest in your opinion
about my daughter or her hair.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.915
That's just if we're keeping it real.

30:33.998 --> 30:35.792
I mean, we might argue

30:36.167 --> 30:37.293
amongst ourselves,

30:37.377 --> 30:39.128
but if you come for our family,

30:39.546 --> 30:40.630
you gonna get that smoke.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.215
-You don't want that smoke.
-Mm-mm.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.300
-Blahp, blahp, blahp.
-Brr, brr!

30:46.010 --> 30:48.680
Now that I think about it,
maybe we will go to San Francisco.

30:48.763 --> 30:50.598
We're not fucking with a yurt,

30:50.682 --> 30:53.309
but we can get a huge suite
at the Ritz Carlton, right?

30:53.393 --> 30:55.645
Pop some Cristal, you know,
on some hip-hop shit.

30:55.728 --> 30:56.563
Hip-hop shit.

30:56.938 --> 30:59.148
And maybe hit up
that Warriors' game? Right?

30:59.232 --> 31:00.567
-We gotta go there.
-Dub City.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.820
Courtside seats, of course.
Nobody's doing Thermoses.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.154
-I mean, we're not animals.
-No.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.282
And we should call Jermaine
and see if we could fly up there

31:07.365 --> 31:08.491
instead of taking the Volp.

31:08.575 --> 31:11.536
Yeah, but apparently,
that drive is so nice, right?

31:11.619 --> 31:13.496
It's a really nice drive.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.791
I'm gonna tell you this,
you know what it's not as nice as?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.042
A private jet.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.087
[both laughing]

31:21.170 --> 31:23.965
So, you know how, in most marriages,
there's, like, a balance?

31:24.048 --> 31:27.093
If-- If one person eats too much,
then the other person eats like a bird?

31:27.176 --> 31:30.054
Or if one person drinks too much,
then the other one's sober?

31:30.138 --> 31:32.307
-Yeah, that's not our parents.
-No.

31:32.390 --> 31:35.476
Yeah, they're both
just equally horrible people.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.978
-The worst.
-[sighing] Exactly! Oh, my gosh.

31:37.061 --> 31:41.232
When it comes to, like, pettiness,
fiscal irresponsibility, and basically,

31:41.316 --> 31:43.443
being on the same page
about the wrong shit...

31:43.526 --> 31:45.278
-they're like the Menendez brothers.
-Okay, no.

31:45.361 --> 31:48.448
They're not <i>like </i>the Menendez brothers.
They are the Menendez brothers.

31:48.531 --> 31:49.365
-Yeah.
-Boom.

31:49.449 --> 31:51.451
[laughter continues] 

31:51.826 --> 31:54.329
-So... we should skedaddle.
-Yeah.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.289
[both] Aw.

31:56.372 --> 31:57.373
-So soon?
-Oh, right. Uh...

31:57.457 --> 31:58.958
-No, no, we got this.
-No, no, no

31:59.042 --> 32:00.376
Literally nothing to us.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.920
-[Kenya] It's hip-hop shit.
-[Joya] Hip-hop shit.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.838
-Okay.
-[Joya] See you in San Fran.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.048
-Yes.
-Oh.

32:05.131 --> 32:05.965
Thermos boys!

32:06.049 --> 32:07.675
-Yes.
-That's my guy.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.593
Right.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.845
Um, you know, the valet's a cash valet.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.513
-[John] Oh, I'm good.
-Oh, you guys need cash?

32:12.597 --> 32:14.098
We got cash.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.225
-Make sure you take care of him?
-[John] No, I am all good.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.310
Please take care of him.

32:17.393 --> 32:19.145
[Kara] No, come on.
Do not take their cash.

32:19.228 --> 32:20.146
[exhales]

32:20.229 --> 32:21.356
[Kenya sighs]

32:21.940 --> 32:23.691
We are not going to San Francisco, right?

32:24.025 --> 32:25.360
-Fuck no!
-[laughs]

32:25.902 --> 32:27.946
Come on. [chuckling]

32:28.363 --> 32:30.114
-I love you, babe.
-I love you too.

32:31.783 --> 32:32.700
You know what?

32:32.784 --> 32:35.203
I'm actually glad I kept this thing, dude.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.246
Yeah, live your life.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.707
I'm not gonna let other people
define my stuff for me.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.417
No, you're successful, you deserve it.

32:41.501 --> 32:43.503
I agree. I'm gonna be happy with who I am.

32:43.586 --> 32:45.672
Oh, look! Scooter Braun.

32:45.755 --> 32:48.174
-Scooter B!
-Oh. Hey, how are you, buddy?

32:48.341 --> 32:50.385
-Long time no see. Hey, how are you?
-[Joya] Hi.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.970
-Nice to see you.
-You as well.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.389
-What's going on?
-You know, just working.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.808
Just killing the game, though,
I mean, Ariana,

32:56.891 --> 32:58.393
-Justin, Demi.
-Thank you, appreciate it.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.062
You know, he's doing pretty well.
I heard about the Netflix deal.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.147
Congratulations.
<i>Coming to America.</i> Incredible.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.774
Thanks, man. Next time we're in town,

33:04.857 --> 33:06.484
-let's please do it for real.
-I'd love that.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.486
-Great seeing you. Take care. Honestly.
-You too.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.696
By the way, nice chain.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.577
[Drea] Any last comments about the dinner
or anything? Just...

33:16.661 --> 33:18.997
[exhaling] I fucking hate white people.
I do.

33:19.330 --> 33:20.999
I tried not to, but...

33:21.582 --> 33:22.917
this is where I'm at.

33:23.209 --> 33:26.254
And I'm just gonna--
I fucking... I fucking hate white people.

33:27.296 --> 33:28.297
Okay.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.718
[music playing] 

33:59.370 --> 34:01.289
-[kid]<i> Mom!</i>
-[woman]<i> Shh! Daddy's working.</i>
