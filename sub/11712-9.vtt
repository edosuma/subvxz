pretty hard to top.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.313
But I'm about to do it.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.566
Citation for public lewdness.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.653
Audrey and I
did it in the park.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.282
Lewdly.

19:19.032 --> 19:19.700
Wow.

19:19.700 --> 19:23.620
Married guy surprises us.
Ringer?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.247
Okay, well...

19:25.247 --> 19:30.586
When I walked in, I mean,
she was already in bed and hot.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.463
Right? So I--

19:32.463 --> 19:34.381
I mean, I-- I--

19:34.381 --> 19:36.091
Oh, God,
I can't do this.

19:36.091 --> 19:39.886
The truth is Jennifer is really
sick and I didn't get any.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.263
Pretty lame, right?

19:41.263 --> 19:43.265
I could've lied,
but you guys are my friends.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.892
And friends
don't lie to each other.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.189
All right, well...

19:50.189 --> 19:53.024
I've got something to say.

19:53.024 --> 19:54.443
You suck!
Ha-ha!

19:54.443 --> 19:56.445
We did it
and you didn't.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.446
How about this?

19:57.446 --> 19:59.615
Laid, lewd, loser! Yeah!

19:59.615 --> 20:03.702
Your fiancée is a slut
and you still didn't get any!

20:03.702 --> 20:05.704

20:12.628 --> 20:14.671
That was great, Danny.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.047
Well...

20:16.047 --> 20:19.926
We Dakotas
are a passionate lot.

20:19.926 --> 20:21.470
And you were so limber.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.765
I can't believe you broke
every bone in your body.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.933
Every bone except...

20:28.394 --> 20:30.979
...one.
