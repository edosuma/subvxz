00:01.917 --> 00:04.248
<i>Kids, sometimes when</i>
<i>you're about to give up</i>

00:04.250 --> 00:06.763
<i>on your love life forever</i>
<i>for the 17th time,</i>

00:07.172 --> 00:09.156
<i>destiny intervenes.</i>

00:09.489 --> 00:12.740
<i>Instead of rushing in,</i>
<i>I took my time</i>

00:12.742 --> 00:14.458
<i>to think up the perfect</i>
<i>opening line.</i>

00:16.329 --> 00:17.912
Wait, no, damn it,
come back! You're really...

00:17.914 --> 00:19.998
You're pretty!

00:20.000 --> 00:21.249
And before I could call
out after her,

00:21.251 --> 00:22.617
in any kind of embarrassing way

00:22.619 --> 00:24.836
that a bunch of teenagers made
fun of for the next five stops

00:24.838 --> 00:26.804
while I stared straight ahead
and pretended not to hear them,

00:26.806 --> 00:28.056
she was gone.

00:28.058 --> 00:31.225
But here's the thing
about Ted Mosby:

00:31.227 --> 00:32.476
he doesn't give up.

00:32.479 --> 00:34.128
Stalker Ted alert.

00:34.130 --> 00:35.563
Repeat, Stalker
Ted alert.

00:35.565 --> 00:37.649
Already has a yellow
legal pad going.

00:37.651 --> 00:39.767
Repeat, already has
a yellow legal pad going.

00:39.769 --> 00:41.235
I'm not stalking.

00:41.237 --> 00:42.987
I just jotted down
a few details

00:42.989 --> 00:44.155
to help me find her.

00:44.157 --> 00:45.490
Uh, like the fact

00:45.492 --> 00:47.358
that her smile was cute,

00:47.360 --> 00:48.493
but a bit crooked,

00:48.495 --> 00:50.311
which can be a sign
of teeth grinding.

00:50.313 --> 00:51.996
So I called up
the city's

00:51.998 --> 00:53.247
top five TMJ specialists,

00:53.249 --> 00:55.667
and here's where it
gets interesting.

00:55.669 --> 00:57.168
Not interesting,
Ted, creepy.

00:57.170 --> 00:58.169
Let her go.

00:58.171 --> 00:59.320
No, this is destiny.

00:59.322 --> 01:01.673
No, Ted,
this is forcing it.

01:01.675 --> 01:05.009
When Lily and I met,
I mean, that was destiny.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.827
<i>She could've knocked</i>
<i>on any door</i>

01:06.829 --> 01:08.262
<i>to find someone</i>
<i>to fix her stereo,</i>

01:08.264 --> 01:09.681
<i>but she knocked on mine.</i>

01:13.268 --> 01:14.936
Now hand over
the pad.

01:17.506 --> 01:19.140
Ted...

01:20.008 --> 01:21.509
And the backup pad.

01:21.511 --> 01:23.611
<i>They were right.</i>

01:23.613 --> 01:25.446
<i>You can't force destiny.</i>

01:25.448 --> 01:27.014
<i>If it's gonna happen,</i>
<i>it's gonna happen.</i>

01:28.735 --> 01:30.234
<i>And funny story, kids...</i>

01:30.236 --> 01:31.869
Oh, my God.

01:31.871 --> 01:33.154
It's you.

01:33.156 --> 01:35.039
<i>...it happened.</i>

01:48.776 --> 01:52.111
Subway Girl's
name is Jeanette,

01:52.113 --> 01:54.347
and she does grind her teeth.

01:54.349 --> 01:56.682
I assume that started
the moment she met you?

01:57.619 --> 01:58.985
Uh, well,
the fact is

01:58.987 --> 02:01.654
she wanted to find me.

02:01.656 --> 02:02.872
The first
thing I did

02:02.874 --> 02:04.324
was list out all the details

02:04.326 --> 02:05.625
I remembered about you.

02:05.627 --> 02:07.627
Is... is that
a yellow legal pad?

02:07.629 --> 02:08.693
Yeah.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.029
I've even got a backup.

02:10.031 --> 02:11.331
Oh, my God.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.032
You had a tweed blazer

02:13.034 --> 02:14.467
and chalk all over your hands,

02:14.469 --> 02:16.052
so I figured you were
either a professor

02:16.054 --> 02:17.754
or a British gymnast.

02:17.756 --> 02:20.723
I'm bloody
good on the pommel 'orse.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.310
Regrettin' this accent.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.179
Can't seem to stop.

02:26.181 --> 02:27.730
So then I asked the lady
at the student center

02:27.732 --> 02:29.182
where I could find
the youngest,

02:29.184 --> 02:30.850
cutest professor on staff.

02:30.852 --> 02:31.934
And...?

02:31.936 --> 02:33.403
She sent me to a physics class.

02:33.405 --> 02:35.238
Professor Leyborne?

02:35.240 --> 02:37.523
I wonder if she'd think
Dr. Goodhair was so cute

02:37.525 --> 02:40.076
if she knew he hasn't been
published in over a year?

02:40.078 --> 02:41.327
Then she sent me here,

02:41.329 --> 02:42.612
but the security guard
wouldn't let me in

02:42.614 --> 02:43.946
without an ID.

02:43.948 --> 02:45.198
I was about to give up

02:45.200 --> 02:47.033
when the fire alarm
just sent you out.

02:47.035 --> 02:48.701
It was like...

02:48.703 --> 02:49.819
Destiny.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.287
Right? Right?

02:51.289 --> 02:52.588
It's a meet-cute.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.673
It's a stalk-crazy.

02:53.675 --> 02:54.691
Look...

02:54.693 --> 02:55.942
there's a fine line

02:55.944 --> 02:58.378
between love and insanity.

02:58.380 --> 02:59.278
It's...

02:59.280 --> 03:01.547
the Dobler-Dahmer theory.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.932
Oh, no...

03:02.934 --> 03:04.567
- Damn, I always forget the little one.
- All right.

03:04.569 --> 03:06.719
If both people are
into each other,

03:06.721 --> 03:08.805
a big romantic gesture works.

03:08.807 --> 03:11.474
Like Lloyd Dobler holding
up the boom box

03:11.476 --> 03:13.643
outside Diane Court's window
in <i>Say Anything.</i>

03:13.645 --> 03:14.977
But if
one person

03:14.979 --> 03:16.112
isn't into the other,

03:16.114 --> 03:18.648
the same gesture comes off
serial-killer crazy,

03:18.650 --> 03:20.400
or Dahmer.

03:20.402 --> 03:21.784
Now, Marshall, the story of

03:21.786 --> 03:24.287
how you asked out Lily
is super sweet.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.273
♪ Lily, how you thrill me

03:27.275 --> 03:29.125
♪ But it may just even kill me

03:29.127 --> 03:31.127
♪ If you do not say "I will-y"

03:31.129 --> 03:33.045
♪ To this question

03:34.798 --> 03:38.885
♪ Will you go out with me?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.804
I will-y.

03:41.806 --> 03:43.222
Dobler.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.991
But if Lily wasn't into you?

03:44.993 --> 03:47.143
♪ Lily, how you thrill me

03:47.145 --> 03:49.312
♪ But it might
just even kill me ♪

03:49.314 --> 03:51.481
♪ If you do not say "I will-y"

03:51.483 --> 03:53.399
♪ To this question

03:54.201 --> 03:57.737
♪ Will you go out with me?

04:00.191 --> 04:01.324
Dahmer.

04:01.326 --> 04:03.443
Whether a gesture's
charming or alarming

04:03.445 --> 04:05.144
depends on how it's received.

04:05.146 --> 04:08.147
And I was charmed
by Jeanette finding me,

04:08.149 --> 04:10.082
hence... she's a Dobler.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.151
Don't you think
it's a little convenient

04:12.153 --> 04:15.488
how that fire alarm happened
to randomly go off?

04:15.490 --> 04:16.706
What are you saying?

04:16.708 --> 04:18.507
Ted, does she have
enormous cans?

04:18.510 --> 04:20.375
No.
Then what we're saying is

04:20.378 --> 04:21.994
she's a crazy stalker bitch
who pulled that fire alarm

04:21.995 --> 04:23.429
and you should
run screaming.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.380
You know what?

04:24.382 --> 04:25.331
I-I don't think

04:25.333 --> 04:26.799
that we should be so cavalier

04:26.801 --> 04:28.217
with the word "stalker."

04:28.219 --> 04:30.303
Why does that word
bother you so much?

04:30.305 --> 04:31.554
Doesn't bother me.

04:31.556 --> 04:34.307
Wait... do you
have a stalker?

04:35.675 --> 04:36.893
I don't want to talk
about this.

04:36.895 --> 04:37.944
What do you mean?

04:37.946 --> 04:39.278
As your fiancé,
if you have

04:39.280 --> 04:41.314
some psycho stalker out
there, I should know.

04:41.316 --> 04:42.615
It was me.

04:42.617 --> 04:43.983
I was a stalker.

04:43.985 --> 04:45.735
It was back
in Canada.

04:45.737 --> 04:47.236
I liked a guy

04:47.238 --> 04:50.022
and he didn't
like me, and...

04:50.024 --> 04:51.524
well, I got
a little obsessed.

04:51.526 --> 04:54.293
I'd fill up my journals
all about him,

04:54.295 --> 04:56.462
and eventually
there may have been

04:56.464 --> 04:59.532
a teensy-weensy
50-meter restraining order.

04:59.534 --> 05:01.700
50 meters?

05:01.702 --> 05:02.718
That's like...

05:02.720 --> 05:04.720
four years.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.472
Wow.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.558
You must have been
a total nutbag.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.542
I wasn't.

05:09.544 --> 05:10.543
Ted is right,

05:10.545 --> 05:11.677
there is
a fine line.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.596
Anyone can cross it
and get obsessed.

05:13.598 --> 05:15.731
Yeah, if you're
a total nutbag.

05:17.101 --> 05:19.352
Now, uh...
who's the guy?

05:19.354 --> 05:20.770
I'm not telling you
until you admit

05:20.772 --> 05:22.188
that this can happen
to anybody.

05:22.190 --> 05:23.222
I'm not admitting that.

05:23.224 --> 05:24.440
Fine. Forget it.
I'm not telling you.

05:24.442 --> 05:25.741
Fine. Forgotten.

05:33.534 --> 05:37.587
<i>"You are so beautiful.</i>

05:37.589 --> 05:38.904
<i>"Why can't you see me?</i>

05:38.906 --> 05:41.457
<i>"Someday, I'll make you see me</i>

05:41.459 --> 05:43.376
<i>"and we'll be together.</i>

05:43.378 --> 05:44.794
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>

05:45.796 --> 05:47.797
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>
<i>P.S. I love you.</i>

05:47.799 --> 05:49.549
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>

05:49.551 --> 05:51.300
<i>"P.S. I love you.</i>
<i>P.S. I love you.</i>

05:51.302 --> 05:54.420
<i>P.S. I love you, you, you."</i>

05:54.422 --> 05:56.105
<i>This is "ridikilus."</i>

05:56.107 --> 05:58.224
<i>Who cares who she</i>
<i>was obsessed with?</i>

05:58.226 --> 06:01.594
<i>What, am I gonna go to Canada</i>
<i>and track this guy down?</i>

06:02.312 --> 06:04.030
<i>Thankfully,</i>

06:04.032 --> 06:05.648
<i>unlike Uncle Barney,</i>
<i>I wasn't the kind of guy</i>

06:05.650 --> 06:07.433
<i>to fixate on</i>
<i>one little detail.</i>

06:07.435 --> 06:09.201
That fire alarm--
did you pull it?

06:09.203 --> 06:10.536
Ugh...

06:10.538 --> 06:11.871
This is embarrassing.

06:11.873 --> 06:14.707
I wasn't gonna tell you this,
but...

06:14.709 --> 06:16.075
<i>I'd come so far,</i>

06:16.077 --> 06:18.711
<i>only to be sent packing</i>
<i>by that security guard,</i>

06:18.713 --> 06:20.463
<i>and... well...</i>

06:23.783 --> 06:24.884
I'm sorry.

06:24.886 --> 06:26.302
I just couldn't stand the idea

06:26.304 --> 06:27.786
of not meeting you.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.755
<i>Could not</i>

06:29.757 --> 06:32.475
stand the idea

06:32.477 --> 06:34.143
of not meeting me.

06:34.145 --> 06:35.511
Was it a little

06:35.513 --> 06:37.980
over the top to pull
that fire alarm? Perhaps.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.815
But it charmed me.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.901
Hence... Dobler.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.353
Aha! You see?

06:44.355 --> 06:46.022
People don't put fire alarms

06:46.024 --> 06:48.658
out in front lobbies
for just anyone to prank pull.

06:48.660 --> 06:50.109
They put smoke detectors

06:50.111 --> 06:51.527
up on the ceiling.

06:51.529 --> 06:53.245
Hold on.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.448
I'm beginning to think
that you guys didn't come here

06:55.450 --> 06:56.999
to see my new lectern.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.619
Are you implying
Jeanette started a fire?

06:59.621 --> 07:00.703
Dahmer.

07:00.705 --> 07:02.305
Dobler.

07:02.307 --> 07:03.673
She's John Cusack,

07:03.675 --> 07:05.041
I'm Ione Skye,

07:05.043 --> 07:07.326
and there is nothing
weird about that.

07:11.214 --> 07:12.715
Gordie Bellavoh.

07:12.717 --> 07:14.550
Thanks again for
the free donuts, eh?

07:14.552 --> 07:17.169
So, you up here
visiting family?

07:17.171 --> 07:19.355
No. I'm not Canadian.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.307
Not even a quarter Canadian
on my father's side.

07:21.309 --> 07:22.642
Shut up.

07:23.694 --> 07:24.727
We're not talking "aboot" me--

07:24.729 --> 07:27.697
<i>about</i> me. Whoa.

07:27.699 --> 07:29.065
How long did you and Robin date?

07:29.067 --> 07:31.117
Well, it wasn't
really dating.

07:31.119 --> 07:33.285
We'd take a sixer of Labatts
behind the hydro plant

07:33.287 --> 07:36.288
and she'd let me go under
her parka over turtleneck.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.457
Summer love.

07:38.459 --> 07:41.127
Was Robin obsessed with you?

07:41.129 --> 07:42.044
No.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.245
No.

07:43.247 --> 07:44.497
Robin was way more into
this guy named...

07:44.499 --> 07:46.415
Turk Grimsby.

07:46.417 --> 07:49.001
I hear Robin
was obsessed with you?

07:49.003 --> 07:50.836
No. We only went out
a few times,

07:50.838 --> 07:51.804
barely knew each other.

07:51.806 --> 07:53.139
All we talked about

07:53.141 --> 07:54.724
was her relationship
with her mother,

07:54.726 --> 07:56.425
the gnawing feelings
of inadequacy,

07:56.427 --> 07:59.011
all the horrible secrets
on that side of the family.

07:59.013 --> 08:00.879
But heck, you're her fiancé.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.214
You know all that, right?

08:02.216 --> 08:03.882
Yeah.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.050
Robin was

08:05.052 --> 08:07.219
way more into this other guy.

08:07.938 --> 08:10.072
Can't seem to remember his name.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.190
Though sometimes
a powdered jelly

08:11.192 --> 08:12.891
can help get
the old noodle going.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.562
Ah...

08:16.564 --> 08:18.030
His name's...

08:18.032 --> 08:19.665
Simon Tremblay.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.033
I should have known.

08:21.035 --> 08:22.067
Eh.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.252
Thanks for the free donuts.

08:23.254 --> 08:24.570
They're just donuts!

08:24.572 --> 08:26.739
Okay? They're like
two for a loonie-- <i>dollar.</i>

08:26.741 --> 08:27.923
What's happening?

08:27.925 --> 08:30.743
Oh, somebody moosed down
all the jellies.

08:30.745 --> 08:33.412
Have you been hanging
out with Turk Grimsby?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.432
So how serious
were you and Robin?

08:36.433 --> 08:39.268
Well, serious enough
to pop the question.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.385
Wow. Really?

08:40.388 --> 08:41.587
Yeah, sure.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.188
Got down on one goalie pad,

08:43.191 --> 08:44.640
I said, "Robin,

08:44.642 --> 08:47.643
could we keep dating but I get
to stick it to other babes?"

08:47.645 --> 08:48.978
Turned me down.

08:48.980 --> 08:50.896
I'm so sorry.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.897
Oh, that's okay.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.983
I really wanted to stick it
to Louise Marsh.

08:55.069 --> 08:57.203
Still, as the years pass,

08:57.205 --> 08:59.705
and you take stock of your life,

08:59.707 --> 09:02.941
part of me wishes I could've
kept sticking it to Robin, too.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.212
So are you the one
that Robin stalked?

09:06.214 --> 09:09.448
Oh, that story goes back
to the 1996 Grey Cup.

09:09.450 --> 09:11.634
What in God's name is that?

09:11.636 --> 09:13.185
Only Canada's Super Bowl.

09:13.187 --> 09:14.220

09:20.812 --> 09:23.462
It's only Canada's

17:42.548 --> 17:44.715
<i>about being with Paul Shaffer.</i>

17:46.501 --> 17:49.620
At the Grey Cup gig, Paul was
sitting in the front row.

17:49.622 --> 17:54.091
♪ I'll always be
waiting for you ♪

17:54.093 --> 17:55.926
No wonder his stomach
was growling.

17:55.928 --> 17:58.929
I feel bad that I scared Paul.

17:58.931 --> 18:01.665
He's amazing.

18:02.334 --> 18:04.318
But I have no regrets.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.237
I was done being Robin Sparkles.

18:06.239 --> 18:07.188
You're not
gonna go get

18:07.190 --> 18:09.807
beat up by Paul Shaffer now,
are you?

18:09.809 --> 18:11.325
I can't believe it.

18:11.327 --> 18:13.611
I'm a total Dahmer.

18:13.613 --> 18:15.746
Yeah, but you're my Dahmer,

18:15.748 --> 18:17.164
which makes you a Dobler.

18:17.166 --> 18:20.067
Just like Jeanette.

18:20.069 --> 18:21.285
No, Ted,

18:21.287 --> 18:24.622
what that woman did to run in
to you was bonkers.

18:24.624 --> 18:26.257
That's just not how you start
a healthy relationship.

18:26.259 --> 18:27.708
Tell him, Lil.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.510
I can't stand
it anymore.

18:29.512 --> 18:31.178
I've been living a lie.

18:31.180 --> 18:33.347
See?

18:33.349 --> 18:34.715
<i>I saw you at orientation</i>

18:34.717 --> 18:37.000
<i>and I needed an excuse</i>
<i>to meet you,</i>

18:37.002 --> 18:37.968
<i>so...</i>

18:37.970 --> 18:39.670
Ah!

18:39.672 --> 18:41.004
<i>I didn't know which room</i>
<i>you were in,</i>

18:41.006 --> 18:44.692
<i>so I had to create</i>
<i>a little destiny.</i>

18:57.156 --> 18:58.572
Okay.

19:02.494 --> 19:04.027
I'm sorry, I just

19:04.029 --> 19:07.047
couldn't stand the idea
of not meeting you.

19:08.100 --> 19:09.333
Could...

19:09.335 --> 19:12.202
not stand the idea

19:12.204 --> 19:13.971
of not meeting me.

19:18.427 --> 19:20.010
I'm sorry, Ted.

19:20.012 --> 19:21.228
You were right.

19:21.230 --> 19:23.347
Jeanette's a Dobler.

19:23.349 --> 19:24.732
So are you.

19:24.734 --> 19:27.050
Thanks, buddy.

19:27.052 --> 19:29.236
You know, if you
hadn't been reading

19:29.238 --> 19:30.604
the exact same book as me,

19:30.606 --> 19:32.189
we never would've met.

19:32.191 --> 19:33.657
I mean, that's destiny.

19:33.659 --> 19:35.776
Oh, look.

19:35.778 --> 19:37.945
You bought it in the
same bookstore I did.

19:37.947 --> 19:40.247
On the same day.

19:40.249 --> 19:44.034
Within ten minutes
of me buying mine.

19:44.036 --> 19:45.870
Ugh...

19:45.872 --> 19:47.455
Uh, this is embarrassing.

19:47.457 --> 19:48.539
I wasn't gonna tell you this,

19:48.541 --> 19:51.909
but I followed you
to that bookstore.

19:51.911 --> 19:55.629
I just couldn't stand
the idea of not meeting you.

19:55.631 --> 19:58.766
You followed me
to the bookstore from where?

19:58.768 --> 20:01.352
How long have you
been following me?

20:01.354 --> 20:03.854
Uh, this is embarrassing.

20:03.856 --> 20:06.774
Uh, remember when you were on
the cover of <i>New York Magazine?</i>

20:06.776 --> 20:09.643
That was like a year
and a half ago.
