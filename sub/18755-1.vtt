00:23.273 --> 00:25.608
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to talk about women.</i>

00:28.779 --> 00:30.738
Mr. Crown?

00:30.823 --> 00:32.782
I'm sorry.
Women.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.703
You've yet to talk
about women.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.705
I enjoy women.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.540
Enjoyment isn't intimacy.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.042
<i>And intimacy isn't</i>
<i>necessarily enjoyment.</i>

00:43.127 --> 00:44.836
How would you know?

00:48.507 --> 00:51.551
<i>Has it occurred to you</i>
<i>that you have</i>
<i>a problem with trust?</i>

00:53.137 --> 00:54.971
I trust myself
implicitly.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.307
Yes, but can other
people trust you?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.476
<i>You mean</i>
<i>society at large?</i>

01:00.561 --> 01:02.520
I mean women,
Mr. Crown.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.816
Yes, a woman
could trust me.

01:07.443 --> 01:08.693
Good.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.903
<i>Under what extraordinary</i>
<i>circumstances</i>

01:10.988 --> 01:13.114
<i>would you allow</i>
<i>that to happen?</i>

01:16.744 --> 01:18.619
A woman could trust me

01:20.998 --> 01:23.958
as long as her interests
didn't run too contrary
to my own.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.504
And society at large,

01:29.339 --> 01:32.675
if its interests
were to run counter
to your own?

02:34.530 --> 02:38.616
Jimmy, I think
I'll walk for a while.
I'll meet you at the office.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.159
You want me to take
your briefcase?

02:40.244 --> 02:41.285
No, I'll carry it.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.587
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

02:55.175 --> 02:56.843
Look at this jerk.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.623
Morning, Mr. Crown.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.000
Bobby.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.501
Back for your
haystacks, huh?

04:13.211 --> 04:15.463
Don't ever let
it go on tour.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.839
Oh, I'll lay down
the law.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.218
You're an odd duck.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.512
Everybody else goes
right for the Monet.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.189
It's very nice.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.359
Nice?
Do you know
what it's worth?

04:39.696 --> 04:41.739
I just like my haystacks.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.701
Yo, you gonna move it?

04:45.786 --> 04:48.496
Come on, buddy.
Let's go. Move it.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.045
Jesus Christ.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.049
Bring it on.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.644
Something's screwed up.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.896
My list says some
kind of sarcophagus.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.190
What do you want me to do?
It's a horse.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.401
You want I should
take it back and dump it?

05:19.111 --> 05:21.237
Just unload the damn thing.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.115
Boy, it's gonna
be hot today.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.840
Good morning, Mr. Crown.
Good morning, Sam.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.300
You can't let 'em
know what's going on.
Know what I mean?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.011
What, do you
own the building?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.554
Excuse us, sir.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.348
What the hell?
What's going on?

05:49.433 --> 05:51.392
He does own
the building.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.730
Good morning,
Mr. Crown.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.024
Good morning,
one and all.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.693
Good morning, Mr. Crown.
John, welcome back.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.611
Good morning, Mr. Crown.
Good morning.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.947
Give me good
numbers, Jimmy.
Good morning, Daria.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.323
Good morning, Mr. Crown.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.034
You forgot your
briefcase, right?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.910
I must've left it
here last night.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.613
We have a disparity here.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.740
I saw that.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.160
Well, we can't
leave it here.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.830
Let's find out
what the problem is.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.209
That is not a sarcophagus.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.923
It's Friday.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.007
What did he
mean by that?

07:47.092 --> 07:49.593
I'd say, come Monday,
there's gonna be hell to pay.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.582
Deuce!

08:21.877 --> 08:24.628
Times in this thing
I never thought
I'd see that.

08:25.213 --> 08:27.882
Thomas Crown
forced to sell something.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.633
So what do you think?

08:29.718 --> 08:32.052
You don't have any regrets
about the way you played this?

08:32.136 --> 08:34.972
Regret is usually
a waste of time.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.018
As is gloating.
Have you figured out

08:39.102 --> 08:40.019
what you're gonna
say to your board

08:40.102 --> 08:42.020
when they learn
that you paid me
30 million more

08:42.105 --> 08:44.148
than others were offering?

08:44.232 --> 08:46.233
Good morning, gentlemen.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.926
All right,
English only from now on.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.809
Gentlemen,
upon closer inspection,

10:01.893 --> 10:05.020
your proposal is not
as generous as you
led us to believe.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.731
There is no mention
of executive compensation.

10:07.816 --> 10:11.110
Look, gentlemen,
we understand your
objection to the merger.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.236
It's not a merger!

10:12.320 --> 10:14.071
Your stockholders
have spoken.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.614
The stock price
was manipulated.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.157
We've anticipated
your reluctance.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.534
We won't be
a Crown subsidiary.

10:18.618 --> 10:22.538
Our attorneys are
prepared to go head-to-head
with you at the SEC.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.832
I thought that kid
would bust a gut

10:24.916 --> 10:27.501
when you went into
that thing about SEC.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.545
That was brilliant!
How's it go?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.672
"It's sad to see
another tired man..."

10:31.756 --> 10:35.134
"Lay down his hand and quit
the holy game of poker."

10:35.218 --> 10:36.635
That's the line, Danny.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.220
He's right, you know.

10:38.305 --> 10:42.057
Third-generation company,
you think they would
have shown more grit.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.855
Don't forget
about the Douglaston
conference call in 10 minutes.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.231
Speak to Scully.
Miso soup, Daria.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.441
On its way.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.629
Go, go, go!

12:13.316 --> 12:17.945
This painting is considered
to be the first impressionist
work in history.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.322
It started
the impressionist movement.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.866
It influenced dozens
of major artists

12:22.951 --> 12:25.327
who went on to found
the first major school

12:25.495 --> 12:27.746
or style of
the 20th century.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.458
Okay. Try this.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.045
It's worth
100 million bucks.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.849
And the government guy
we paid off to make
the state deal is back.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.643
No, this is the second
time they lied.
Screw 'em.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.728
Daniel, you had turkey.
Mr. Schmidt called from UBS.

12:51.813 --> 12:52.813
There's an opening
for the board.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.022
Conference call
in 10 minutes.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.488
Young lady,

13:03.032 --> 13:04.533
do not touch.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.454
I'll let you go this time.
On your way.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.846
Jimmy, would you
take a look in
the compressor room?

14:07.931 --> 14:09.681
There's something
wonky with the A.C.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.683
Can't we pass it
on to Engineering?

14:11.768 --> 14:13.519
The book says
we check it first.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.937
All right.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.360
It would be
one of the hottest
days of the year.

14:21.444 --> 14:24.029
Can you believe
it's nearly October?

14:34.749 --> 14:35.999
Why don't you
bring the kids?

14:36.084 --> 14:37.209
Are you kidding?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.627
You know how she is.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.879
She'd probably run to court
saying I was endangering them.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.551
You're not kiddin'?

14:45.635 --> 14:48.387
You wouldn't
believe the shit
the woman deals out.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.995
The whole air-conditioning
plant's crapped out.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.497
Why didn't they
call Maintenance?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.424
See you in the morning.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.301
Found your briefcase, I see.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.427
Evidently.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.511
Good night, sir.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.433
That's good.
Here you go.
Okay.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.934
Thanks.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.329
They want to talk
to you upstairs.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.123
Me, or the regular proctor?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.334
Because McKinley'll be back
in a couple seconds.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.586
I think you should
talk to them.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.675
Call them if you like.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.602
Administration. Hello?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.771
<i>This is Jeff in wing eight.</i>

17:02.939 --> 17:05.357
I was just told you
wanted to speak to me.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.358
I'll be right up.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.031
I'll just go up.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.492
Sorry.
This exhibit
is closing.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.868
I'll have to
ask you to leave.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.329
This exhibit
is now closed.

17:19.414 --> 17:20.497
Please use
the nearest exit.

17:20.580 --> 17:22.290
This exhibit
is now closed.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.625
We are closed
for the evening.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.001
We're closing.
Thank you.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.295
Please exit
through the rear.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.388
Thank you.
Right this way.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.556
Good night.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.558
Thank you very much.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.476
I'm sorry, sir.
This exhibit is closed.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.732
What have we got here?

17:46.816 --> 17:49.067
It's only
a quarter to 5:00.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.779
We are closed.
For cleaning.

18:22.685 --> 18:26.188
Hey, Bobby,
I've been evicted.
What do you mean?

18:26.272 --> 18:29.357
The impressionist Gallery,
closed for cleaning.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.151
Cleaning?

18:31.235 --> 18:32.277
Doing it right now.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.824
Ed, want to lend me
a hand here for a minute?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.576
Certainly.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.803
Excuse me.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.223
What do you think
you're doing?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.433
Yes.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.810
What?

19:04.894 --> 19:07.562
Upstairs sent us down
to clean this exhibit.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.190
They've got some
VIPs coming through.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.943
I didn't hear about it.
I oversee this section.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.654
Call upstairs
if you like.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.574
No, you're right.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.619
They've been having people
down here all week.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.099
Stop him!
Watch it now!

19:47.436 --> 19:49.187
Look out, Mr. Crown.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.819
One at a time. Quickly.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.655
Keep moving in
a calm manner, please.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.991
No need to panic.
Thank you.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.496
Hold it right there.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.667
Freeze!

20:53.336 --> 20:55.086
Keep your hands up!

21:12.688 --> 21:14.856
68th and Lexington.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.674
Good evening, sir.
Hey, Paul.

21:40.883 --> 21:43.009
Wanna put this
in the study?

21:43.094 --> 21:44.302
I set out
a bottle of wine.

21:44.387 --> 21:45.553
Thank you.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.264
I may have won a cruise.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.863
Oh, yes.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.871
Mikey.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.539
They find the chopper?

22:54.623 --> 22:55.915
Abandoned in Queens.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.125
We know where
it was stolen?
Checking.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.586
Maybe a pad in the Hamptons.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.588
Mr. Lenox.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.341
Mr. Lenox is the director
of the museum.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.635
This is
Detective Michael McCann.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.971
Sorry to be here, sir.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.098
Who are the actors?

23:12.183 --> 23:13.308
Four, all foreign.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.851
Probably Eastern European.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.311
No print records.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.563
Illegals.
Check with lnterpol.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.773
Russian government
might help.

23:19.857 --> 23:23.735
In the works. Point of entry
was a hollow statue
delivered this morning.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.820
They brought it in
through their own security.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.823
Next you're gonna
tell me it was a horse.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.742
A Trojan horse?
Bingo.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.910
Somebody's got
a sense of humor.

23:31.994 --> 23:33.828
We got three digits
off the truck plate.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.789
This place
been hit before?

23:35.873 --> 23:37.665
They just lost their cherry.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.168
I gather it was just
the one painting?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.003
But it's such
an important one.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.422
It's a seminal work,
a historical watershed.

23:44.507 --> 23:45.924
It's truly irreplaceable.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.008
I love this neighborhood.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.927
Some of these broads
are wearing my salary.

23:49.011 --> 23:50.720
So the skylight
was rigged to blow?

23:50.805 --> 23:54.516
Yeah.
And there were cargo nets
spread out, ready to use.

23:54.850 --> 23:58.103
And they were wearing
rappelling harnesses
underneath their clothes.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.151
Let's just track
this thing through.
So they kill the air,

24:05.236 --> 24:08.363
make the place uncomfortable,
drive out the tourists, right?

24:08.531 --> 24:11.825
Then they lower these gates
so nobody can get in
to disturb them.

24:11.909 --> 24:15.161
Then they
lower the paintings
into the cargo nets.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.997
Pull the paintings,
ditch the frames.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.624
Figure they're gonna
fly out of here

24:19.708 --> 24:22.460
like a road company
<i>of Peter Pan.</i>

24:22.545 --> 24:24.212
But somebody
makes them early.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.922
Chopper takes off.

24:26.006 --> 24:28.091
Some of the crew make it,
some of them don't.

24:28.217 --> 24:32.428
Basically,
amateur night, right?

24:32.513 --> 24:33.888
What's that?

24:33.973 --> 24:36.224
It was wedged
under the gate.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.976
And?

24:40.604 --> 24:42.522
Not exactly Samsonite.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.400
Titanium.
The engineer said that
it'd have to absorb

24:45.484 --> 24:48.194
15 to 20 tons
to stop this gate.

24:52.658 --> 24:55.493
Seems there
may be a couple of
holes in your theory.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.458
They shut off the air
to drive out the tourists,

25:02.585 --> 25:04.752
then they escort
them out anyway?

25:10.426 --> 25:13.511
Then they close the gates
to keep everybody out

25:13.637 --> 25:18.349
but block one of them open
while they prepare to load,
conservatively,

25:18.434 --> 25:21.561
1,000 pounds of paintings
and 800 pounds of men,

25:21.645 --> 25:24.189
that we know
about, in a...

25:24.940 --> 25:26.608
What was the chopper model?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.776
Sikorsky S-76.

25:28.861 --> 25:33.156
Right. In a chopper
with a 600-pound
useful load.

25:35.284 --> 25:39.120
You figure you'll
wrap this by morning,
do you, Lieutenant?

25:39.997 --> 25:42.874
It's Detective.
And I'm a little fuzzy
about who you are.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.876
I'm sorry.
I'm Catherine Banning.
Of?

25:44.960 --> 25:48.296
Zurich underwriters
requested...
Well, actually...

25:48.380 --> 25:49.797
You're insurance.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.884
There are a couple
Swiss gentlemen

25:52.968 --> 25:54.761
who'd rather not write
a $100 million check.

25:54.845 --> 25:57.305
So, I'm stuck
with you on my back.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.307
Come on, Lieutenant.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.185
Who knows?
You might enjoy it.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.328
Thousand bucks says
you can't do that again.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.501
Tony, put another
ball down there.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.128
Tommy, it was
a figure of speech.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.757
Let's make it interesting,
shall we? 10-to-one?

26:32.841 --> 26:35.009
Fine.
I'll take your money.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.313
Let's go again.
Still 10-to-one.

26:48.691 --> 26:52.402
That's $100,000 on
a goddamn golf swing.

26:53.529 --> 26:56.322
It's a beautiful
Saturday morning, John.

26:56.699 --> 26:59.033
What the hell else
do we gotta do?

27:00.995 --> 27:04.580
She does live in Europe
but she's actually
from the Midwest.

27:04.665 --> 27:07.292
Born Catherine Olds.
Who's Banning?

27:07.376 --> 27:09.627
Some Englishman she married
for six months.

27:09.712 --> 27:10.795
So she's not
law enforcement.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.464
Worse.
Bail bonds and bounties.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.216
Whoa, tough people.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.510
Her father's
an Ohio hardcase,

27:17.594 --> 27:20.221
Clarence Milton Olds,
called Bumper Olds.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.724
Story goes he kept a chain
on his back bumper.

27:22.808 --> 27:26.936
A guy ran on him once,
he brought him back
on the end of the chain.

27:27.021 --> 27:29.480
Guess you don't wanna
cross old Clarence.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.983
Good morning.
How are you?

27:36.280 --> 27:38.823
I said, how are you?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.451
Jet-lagged. Thank you.

28:05.768 --> 28:10.146
We thought we'd start
with the security tapes.
What is that?

28:10.606 --> 28:12.231
You don't wanna know.

28:12.316 --> 28:16.027
All right.
These are yesterday's tapes
from the impressionist wing.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.488
Why are they different
from the corridor cameras?

28:18.572 --> 28:20.239
We're upgrading
to thermal imagery.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.033
So far, it's just
the high-value areas.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.286
But it works in the dark.
Even senses body heat.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.872
Got it. So that's
the Monet that morning.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.040
Right.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.500
Skip forward
to the robbery.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.295
Time of the robbery.
Whoa.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.671
Zip.

28:35.798 --> 28:39.509
Was the camera
still working, or what,
did they cut the feed?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.558
That's why
they cut the air.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.060
You know,
that could be.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.521
These things need
a 10-degree difference.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.066
If the temperature of
the ambient gets within
10 degrees of the bodies...

28:55.150 --> 28:58.194
Then the camera
can't tell between
people and walls.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.821
How hot did it get
in the museum?

28:59.905 --> 29:02.031
Check the other cameras.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.867
So why can you see
people in this room?

29:04.952 --> 29:08.329
The ambient in that wing
only went up to the mid-80s.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.248
Wait a minute.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.166
You're telling me
that for some reason,

29:12.251 --> 29:15.753
the area around that
particular painting
went above 90?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.219
What?

29:25.180 --> 29:28.141
I don't know. Something.

29:29.059 --> 29:31.185
What,
are we channeling now?

29:34.857 --> 29:36.858
How long you been
doing this?

29:36.942 --> 29:38.192
A while.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.988
Where? In Europe?

29:42.072 --> 29:43.364
And other places.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.324
You're a real
self-promoter.

29:45.409 --> 29:46.826
Give me a for instance.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.832
How many legs?
What?

29:53.542 --> 29:55.209
The bench.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.254
Two.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.465
You still have
that tape up?
Yeah.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.759
Great. Back it up
to the morning part
of the tape.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.638
Stop.

30:11.852 --> 30:13.019
Hello.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.396
Jesus.

30:17.399 --> 30:20.109
<i>So they bring</i>
<i>this thing in</i>
<i>earlier in the day.</i>

30:20.527 --> 30:22.361
It could be a heater.

30:23.614 --> 30:24.697
What?

30:24.781 --> 30:26.199
In the briefcase,
on a timer.

30:26.909 --> 30:29.494
Bring the temperature up
10 more degrees.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.078
You ever eat?

30:31.413 --> 30:32.413
Hmm?

30:33.081 --> 30:34.916
Lunch, for instance?

30:35.250 --> 30:38.544
You like pizza?
I know a great place
we could stop.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.299
I'm on London time.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.262
And pizza's not your thing.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.556
What's the matter,
Lieutenant?

30:50.641 --> 30:52.600
Did she leave you
for a stockbroker?

30:54.102 --> 30:57.021
It's Detective,
First Grade.

30:58.357 --> 31:02.109
And he was a urologist.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.865
Can I drop you someplace?
At your hotel?

31:07.950 --> 31:09.951
One, I keep
an apartment here,

31:10.035 --> 31:11.953
and two,
I'm going to your office.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.623
She keeps an apartment.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.125
I keep goldfish.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.589
Hello there, little lady.
How are you doing?

31:23.674 --> 31:24.882
Detective.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.551
They don't seem
to be Russian.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.928
Tadross thinks
maybe Romanian.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.847
The witness is here.
Right.

31:31.932 --> 31:33.307
Come on in.
Mmm-hmm

31:43.485 --> 31:44.902
Number four.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.779
You're sure?

31:46.863 --> 31:47.989
I'm sure.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.785
Would you mind
indicating that here?
Certainly.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.662
Just check it off.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.497
And if you could
sign down here, please.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.750
These gentlemen
will take you out,
finish the paperwork.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.919
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you very much.

32:02.004 --> 32:04.171
We're gonna go
beat up the Romanians.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.048
Thank you, thank you.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.176
Wait a minute.
I gotta get some coffee.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.845
That sums it up,
gentlemen.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.430
And you'd be
willing to testify?

32:12.514 --> 32:14.390
Absolutely.

32:14.474 --> 32:18.728
I have to tell you,
people like this,
they might have friends.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.356
You realize they might
try to make it ugly
for a witness.

32:22.441 --> 32:26.861
I understand, gentlemen,
and I guess
I'll take my chances.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.779
We'll nail these jokers.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.323
I can't imagine
somebody thinking

32:30.407 --> 32:32.074
they'd get away
with a thing like this.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.052
They say anything yet?

32:51.136 --> 32:52.678
Not in English.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.599
They're still trying
to find somebody
to translate.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.185
Let me try.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.395
Do not tell me
you speak Romanian.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.940
God, who would
ever bother
with Romanian?

33:06.026 --> 33:07.902
Give me the quiet one.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.153
Okay.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.658
They do speak English.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.786
It was
a prepackaged robbery.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.663
He picked them up
in Little Odessa.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.581
They were given
timetables, electrical...

34:44.666 --> 34:45.958
Who's "he"?

34:47.668 --> 34:49.754
You don't think
they know, do you?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.088
I mean,
there were intermediaries.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.257
They never saw his face
or heard his voice.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.467
One-time hires.
That's why they failed.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.847
What makes you think
they failed?

35:00.015 --> 35:02.933
Oh, maybe it was
a successful robbery.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.685
Maybe they were
set up to fail.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.938
Why?
Diversion.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.316
Make a lot of noise
over there

35:10.609 --> 35:13.527
so over here in this room
you can take 100 million
off the wall

35:13.612 --> 35:15.029
and waltz right out
the front door.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.449
Oh, that's good.
Doesn't matter.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.951
As soon as he tries to
sell it, we nail him.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.307
He's not gonna sell.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.059
- He's not?
Mmm-mmm.

35:45.227 --> 35:48.562
This is an elegant crime
done by an elegant person.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.731
It's not about the money.
Okay.

35:50.816 --> 35:54.693
So who's gonna risk prison
to steal a Monet

35:55.403 --> 35:57.071
just to not sell it?

35:57.197 --> 35:58.739
A Monet lover.

36:00.242 --> 36:01.992
Whose desk is that?

36:02.285 --> 36:03.869
Could I use it?

36:03.954 --> 36:05.246
Yeah. Sure.

36:06.081 --> 36:10.668
Okay. Let's dig up
every major auction
in the last five years

36:10.961 --> 36:13.838
and see who's been
bidding on Monets.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.508
See anyone we know?

36:19.719 --> 36:20.803
Him?

36:21.346 --> 36:23.889
A big day for this guy
is taking off his tie.

36:23.974 --> 36:25.766
He's a finance geek.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.434
Is he?

36:40.407 --> 36:42.116
How's that?
Yeah!

36:52.002 --> 36:53.460
Go, go!

37:19.779 --> 37:21.405
Ease up.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.534
Whoa.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.846
Come on! Get 'em up.
Get it! Let's go!

38:27.389 --> 38:31.642
I saw him wreck
a $100,000 boat because
he liked the splash.

38:32.060 --> 38:35.229
Do you have any idea
what kind of flesh-eating
lawyers this guy has?

38:35.355 --> 38:36.522
Hmm?
Mmm-hmm.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.607
Not to mention
political connections.

38:42.278 --> 38:45.114
Mr. Thomas Crown
has very generously loaned us

38:45.198 --> 38:48.450
a Pissarro
until our own Monet
is restored to us.

38:48.535 --> 38:53.080
Not to mention
personally apprehending
one of the suspects. Come on!

38:56.126 --> 38:58.585
I'm afraid Jim
embellishes horrendously.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.963
I just did what Jim does
at these fundraisers.

39:01.047 --> 39:04.842
I waved my arms in the air
and shrieked for help.

39:06.386 --> 39:07.594
Hello, Gloria. How are you?

39:07.679 --> 39:08.846
Lovely to see you.

39:08.930 --> 39:09.847
You're well?

39:09.931 --> 39:11.140
I knew him, you know.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.683
Did you, madam?
His son, that is.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.728
Lucien Pissarro
in the '30s in Paris.

39:15.812 --> 39:17.646
It's very impressive.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.691
Well, it seemed
the right size
for the space.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.860
Or maybe you were
bored with it.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.531
Do we know each other?

39:27.657 --> 39:29.992
Not yet.
I'm Catherine Banning.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.454
Thomas Crown.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.248
- Vodka rocks, twist.
- Okay.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.125
And scotch neat.

39:38.460 --> 39:39.668
Mmm-hmm.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.379
How did you know that?

39:42.505 --> 39:43.839
I've been reading about you.

39:43.965 --> 39:45.591
Oh? Where?

39:45.675 --> 39:46.842
In a file.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.805
Who do you work for?

39:51.973 --> 39:53.807
I'm in the art world.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.226
Dealer?
Mmm-mmm.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.645
Gallery owner?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.314
No, it's closer
to insurance.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.068
I'm covered.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.654
Not for this.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.783
The painting?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.118
The Monet?

40:14.996 --> 40:19.416
You don't think
they'd simply cut a check
for $100 million, do you?

40:20.335 --> 40:21.376
So you...

40:21.461 --> 40:22.503
Get them things.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.006
When there's this
much money involved,

40:26.091 --> 40:28.967
it usually means
I get them someone's head.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.261
And whose head
are you after?

40:31.346 --> 40:33.847
Yours.
Good evening, Mr. Crown.

40:38.812 --> 40:40.604
Are you trying to...

40:41.523 --> 40:45.609
Are you trying to imply
that I had something to do
with that painting?

40:45.693 --> 40:47.903
Trying? Thank you.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.532
No, I wouldn't
call it an attempt.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.742
What's your take
from this?

40:53.827 --> 40:55.702
5 % of the value recovered.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.872
Oh. A bounty hunter.
If you like.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.749
Always get your man?
Mmm-hmm.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.544
Think you'll get me?

41:04.712 --> 41:06.213
Oh, I hope so.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.469
Can I drop
you somewhere?

41:12.554 --> 41:14.221
I have a car here. Thanks.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.682
Then tomorrow?

41:19.686 --> 41:21.603
Us, dinner?

41:24.941 --> 41:26.316
You're on.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.068
Let's make it early.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.570
We've got a stop
to make first.

41:35.535 --> 41:38.245
What's happened?
Happened?

41:38.329 --> 41:41.331
Whenever I talk
while you're tuning
out what I say

41:41.416 --> 41:43.375
the corners of
your mouth go up.

41:43.626 --> 41:46.420
You're enjoying something.
It's not me. What is it?

41:46.796 --> 41:48.338
An entertainment.

41:48.423 --> 41:49.882
Very little
entertains you.

41:49.966 --> 41:52.593
So I can easily guess.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.430
A worthy adversary?

41:58.099 --> 41:59.099
Hmm?

42:01.686 --> 42:03.687
Did someone swindle you?

42:09.068 --> 42:11.195
You waltz in there
without even a heads-up,

42:11.279 --> 42:14.781
without one word to me
or anyone else
in the department.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.701
I had a little chat
with him, yes.

42:17.785 --> 42:20.370
You had a little chat.
You told him balls-out
he was a suspect.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.372
I cut through the crap.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.095
How long was it
gonna take you, Mike?

42:37.180 --> 42:39.932
Weeks of wiretaps,
if you could get them.

42:40.016 --> 42:41.767
Guys tailing him
to the bathroom.

42:41.851 --> 42:44.102
I found out in 10 minutes.

42:44.938 --> 42:48.565
He did it. The smug
son of a bitch did it.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.234
You compromised
the investigation.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.443
No, I jump-started it.

42:51.527 --> 42:55.322
Oh, really? What do you
have to show for it,
besides a date?

42:56.282 --> 42:58.992
The man likes the high wire.
I'm gonna play
with him for a while.

42:59.160 --> 43:02.663
Well, I think
there's some question
as to who's playing whom.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.539
You saying
I shouldn't go?

43:04.624 --> 43:07.834
Don't piss
on the department, okay?
We're on this.

43:24.519 --> 43:26.687
How do you do?
This is a warrant.

43:26.813 --> 43:30.565
We're here to conduct
a legal search of
these premises. I'd let us.

43:30.650 --> 43:32.609
Jack, give me
two men up here.

43:32.694 --> 43:33.944
I want two more men
in this room here.

43:34.028 --> 43:35.237
Let's go. Move, move.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.697
Come on. Let's go.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.784
John, take the back room.

43:45.206 --> 43:46.790
You want help in here?

43:48.960 --> 43:50.377
Mr. Crown.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.587
Thank you. Excuse me?

43:52.672 --> 43:54.965
Why are you in my house?

43:55.049 --> 43:56.258
I'm sure it's
a mystery to you,

43:56.342 --> 43:57.926
but your lawyer will
be able to explain.

43:58.553 --> 43:59.803
Wallace?

44:06.227 --> 44:08.979
This gentleman
happens to be
my attorney.

44:24.829 --> 44:28.498
Keep your knickers on.
I'll get into his house.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.772
You look wonderful.
Thank you.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.815
How are you?
Popular.

45:00.782 --> 45:03.617
<i>Mikey.</i>
<i>Man, you're not</i>
<i>gonna believe this.</i>

45:04.243 --> 45:06.703
You know where
he's taking her?

45:06.954 --> 45:08.455
To the museum.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.376
He's takin' her to
the fucking museum.

45:12.460 --> 45:13.752
<i>It's kinda sweet.</i>

45:13.836 --> 45:16.213
You know,
for a first date. Huh?

45:16.714 --> 45:19.549
Hey, I didn't know
your portrait was here.

45:20.093 --> 45:22.886
The faceless businessman
in a bowler hat.

45:22.970 --> 45:25.013
Everything but
the briefcase.

45:25.098 --> 45:26.723
Did you have to sit
long for the artist?

45:28.309 --> 45:31.436
Actually,
I do own a copy of that.

45:33.564 --> 45:35.273
Oh, of course you do.

45:35.358 --> 45:37.401
And where might
you be taking me?

45:37.485 --> 45:38.860
Come, come, come, come.

45:40.154 --> 45:43.657
Good evening, sir.
The museum is closing
in 15 minutes.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.450
Thank you.

45:46.702 --> 45:49.579
Your loaner.
That's the least
I could do.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.583
I see they got
the air back on.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.503
I shouldn't have
checked my coat.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.799
Well, thank you.

46:00.883 --> 46:03.635
You know,
if I had my pick
in this room

46:04.637 --> 46:06.680
I wouldn't have
taken the Monet.

46:07.849 --> 46:09.349
No?
No.

46:09.684 --> 46:11.476
What would you take?

46:12.061 --> 46:14.020
For my personal choice?

46:20.027 --> 46:21.695
That one.

46:25.575 --> 46:27.033
You?

46:28.369 --> 46:30.370
You'd like to have that?

46:31.122 --> 46:32.372
Why?

46:32.999 --> 46:34.916
Would you
get it for me?

46:35.209 --> 46:37.127
Anything's obtainable.

46:43.885 --> 46:45.552
Okay, I'll bite.

46:45.887 --> 46:48.054
What would you do
to get it?

46:48.848 --> 46:50.474
I'd buy a print.

47:06.491 --> 47:08.658
it looks like
they're going
into Cipriani.

47:08.743 --> 47:10.744
Wait a minute. I thought
they were supposed
to go to Le Cirque.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.705
<i>I'm watching them</i>
<i>walk into Cipriani.</i>

47:13.789 --> 47:15.790
And with no reservation.

47:16.250 --> 47:20.462
Scotch neat for me,
and I guess the lady
would like a...

47:20.546 --> 47:22.088
What?

47:22.256 --> 47:25.008
That the lady
actually likes champagne.

47:25.134 --> 47:27.385
We have Krug
Grand Cuvée 1981.

47:27.470 --> 47:28.929
Sounds great. Thank you.

47:29.013 --> 47:30.680
Wonderful. On the way.

47:30.806 --> 47:31.973
You've been busy.

47:33.267 --> 47:36.144
I'm sure your files
are thicker than mine.

47:36.729 --> 47:38.605
The thing that
impressed me most

47:38.689 --> 47:42.442
was getting from
Glasgow to Oxford
on a boxing scholarship.

47:42.568 --> 47:44.986
Not bad for a wee lad
from "Glasgee."

47:45.071 --> 47:47.781
it was easy.
Rich kids can't box.

47:50.076 --> 47:52.619
The hard part was
learning to talk.

47:53.412 --> 47:56.081
But you, now.
The matador?

47:56.499 --> 47:57.791
The ltalian industrialist?

47:57.875 --> 48:00.043
The ambassador's son?
He was cute.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.963
He was 17.
Yes, he was.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.881
I must admit,
that's a fair litany

48:04.966 --> 48:07.092
for a young girl
from Lima, Ohio.

48:07.468 --> 48:11.596
But the part I didn't get...
l mean, it's obvious
that you like men,

48:12.139 --> 48:15.642
but you never keep
any of them around
very long either.

48:18.104 --> 48:21.898
Oh, well,
men make women messy.

48:26.279 --> 48:27.654
Thank you.

48:30.992 --> 48:33.326
Here's to the fear
of being trapped.

48:50.803 --> 48:51.928
Here's the fish
for the lady.

48:52.013 --> 48:53.096
Thank you.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.098
You're welcome.
And the lamb chops
for the gentleman.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.392
Thank you. We'd like
to pre-order soufflés.

48:57.476 --> 49:01.271
And I'd like to send
a bottle of burgundy
to those two gentlemen.

49:01.355 --> 49:03.064
Of course, sir.
Enjoy.

49:03.149 --> 49:04.816
Thank you. At least
they look like uptown.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.526
The ones yesterday
looked like flashers.

49:06.611 --> 49:08.820
Well, we do our best.

49:08.904 --> 49:09.988
I'm under glass.

49:11.365 --> 49:14.034
Soon you'll know
everything about me.

49:14.535 --> 49:16.953
There are things
we don't know.

49:17.038 --> 49:18.038
Like what?

49:20.249 --> 49:21.374
Like why.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.336
Were you bored?

49:24.420 --> 49:27.631
Acquisitions and mergers
looking a little stodgy?

49:30.009 --> 49:32.761
Is it more fun getting it
than keeping it?

49:32.845 --> 49:33.970
Is this the fun
part for you?

49:34.055 --> 49:35.138
How do you mean?

49:35.222 --> 49:37.140
It's not about the money.

49:37.224 --> 49:41.561
You like the chase.
Not many women
get to chase.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.482
It's like poker.
We don't let you
in the game.

49:45.566 --> 49:48.068
You're right.
My brothers said I didn't
have the mind for it.

49:48.152 --> 49:49.486
And now they're plumbers.

49:49.570 --> 49:51.071
Oh, but you knew that.

50:02.124 --> 50:04.668
Can I ply you
with anything else?
Nothing.

50:04.752 --> 50:06.211
Cheese tray?
Would you like a...

50:06.295 --> 50:07.754
Would you like a deal?

50:09.423 --> 50:11.424
Make it easy
on yourself.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.844
We'll just get
more warrant searches.

50:15.346 --> 50:17.430
Mess up your carpeting.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.016
May I...

50:23.104 --> 50:25.814
May I ask you
a very personal question?

50:26.107 --> 50:27.732
Why not?

50:30.444 --> 50:32.737
Would you like
another hit of espresso?

50:33.781 --> 50:35.156
Would you like another...

50:35.241 --> 50:36.741
Like another hit
of espresso?

50:37.410 --> 50:38.410
Mmm.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.870
That's the very
personal question?

50:40.955 --> 50:42.205
That's as good
as it gets.

50:42.289 --> 50:44.457
Oh. Excuse me.

50:46.127 --> 50:48.002
May I ask you
a very personal question?

50:48.087 --> 50:49.879
Oh, sure. By all means.

50:50.131 --> 50:54.300
Do you really think
I'm going to sleep with
a man I'm investigating?

50:55.845 --> 50:57.887
Is that the question?
Yes, that's it.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.389
Why should I
answer your question

50:59.473 --> 51:02.392
when you didn't commit
to my espresso?

51:02.852 --> 51:06.104
All right.
I'll seriously commit
to your espresso.

51:47.855 --> 51:49.063
I'd let you in...

51:49.148 --> 51:51.858
But the world is watching.

51:53.027 --> 51:54.027
Yes, they are.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.446
And besides,
you've got no furniture.

51:57.031 --> 52:00.200
Oh, that's good.
That's very good.

52:03.537 --> 52:06.039
Good night.
Good night.

52:35.486 --> 52:36.903
Alone?

53:46.974 --> 53:48.725
Ready?

53:48.809 --> 53:49.893
Okay.

54:04.825 --> 54:06.075
Ground.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.368
Okay.

54:07.745 --> 54:08.828
Ten.

54:09.622 --> 54:10.830
Eleven.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.082
Twelve.

54:13.167 --> 54:14.334
Thirteen.

54:15.294 --> 54:16.586
Fourteen.

54:17.046 --> 54:18.838
Fifteen.

54:18.923 --> 54:20.340
Sixteen.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.259
Seventeen.

54:23.802 --> 54:25.178
Eighteen.

54:26.221 --> 54:27.722
Nineteen.

54:27.806 --> 54:28.973
Got it.

54:29.058 --> 54:31.059
Good.
You're slippin', Larry.

54:31.143 --> 54:33.102
Give me a break,
all right?

54:33.187 --> 54:34.938
Guy's got a 10-digit PIN.

54:39.568 --> 54:40.777
Check the basement first.

54:40.861 --> 54:42.028
You got it.

55:47.219 --> 55:49.262
Excuse me.
Is that it?

55:49.346 --> 55:51.264
We got it.
She got it!

55:51.432 --> 55:52.849
Excuse me.

55:59.064 --> 56:00.356
ls the expert here?

56:00.441 --> 56:01.649
Ready and waiting,
darling.

56:01.734 --> 56:03.818
Let's see what you got.
Okay.

56:03.902 --> 56:06.195
Look,
this is George French,
head of forensics.

56:06.280 --> 56:07.739
Hi, George.

56:07.823 --> 56:10.074
This is Dr. Cornelius
of Manhattanville.
Come on in, Doc.

56:10.159 --> 56:12.535
This is Catherine Banning.
How do you do?

56:12.619 --> 56:14.954
Hello.
Well, go to work,
Doctor.

56:18.125 --> 56:20.501
Don't glare at me, Michael.

56:21.211 --> 56:26.215
So are the laws
of the United States
completely unknown to you?

56:27.259 --> 56:29.385
Or is it because
you've been living
in fucking Morocco?

56:29.470 --> 56:30.511
Monaco.

56:30.596 --> 56:31.679
Mogambo.
I don't give a shit.

56:31.764 --> 56:34.348
It's illegal entry,
theft, trespassing.

56:34.433 --> 56:36.017
I'm not a cop.
No, you're not a cop.

56:36.101 --> 56:38.186
If you were a cop,
you'd know that
this won't hold up.

56:38.312 --> 56:40.938
Don't you want him
to go up for...
My job is the painting.

56:41.023 --> 56:43.024
You've got a ghost here.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.860
What?

56:45.944 --> 56:48.112
Another painting
underneath.

56:49.281 --> 56:51.324
Monet reused his canvases.

56:57.664 --> 56:59.832
Monet's unknown
masterpiece

57:00.834 --> 57:03.086
<i>Dogs at Cards.</i>

57:05.339 --> 57:08.466
Where is that sack of shit?
Where is he right now?

57:47.381 --> 57:48.965
Excuse me?

57:49.049 --> 57:50.299
I'm cutting in.

57:53.762 --> 57:55.555
It's all right.

57:55.639 --> 57:57.390
I'll see you later.

58:04.314 --> 58:06.649
It's a black-and-white ball.

58:06.900 --> 58:10.069
Oh, so.
I wasn't invited anyway.

58:13.240 --> 58:14.532
You left yourself
wide open.

58:14.616 --> 58:15.867
You're all flushed.

58:15.951 --> 58:17.994
How many people
can forge a Monet?

58:18.078 --> 58:19.412
Five, maybe six?

58:19.872 --> 58:22.331
Come now.
I'm sure I can't be
arrested for a joke.

58:22.416 --> 58:24.667
Oh, but this was
a little too good.

58:24.751 --> 58:26.711
You think you're
just inches away.

58:27.588 --> 58:28.963
I am inches away.

58:29.047 --> 58:31.007
You think I'm just gonna
peck at crumbs you lay out?

58:31.091 --> 58:33.217
I can smell blood
on my own.

58:35.596 --> 58:36.846
You smug son of a...

59:52.589 --> 59:55.258
Do you want to dance

59:55.342 --> 59:57.301
or do you want to dance?

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.107
Get away, get away!

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:41.030
You are the most
remarkable woman.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.617
You don't think
we're finished, do you?

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:30.788
Good morning.
Good morning.

01:02:30.872 --> 01:02:32.039
Good morning, Paul.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.332
Can I get you
anything else?

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:35.000
Not a thing.

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.169
Thank you, Paul.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.295
Thank you, Paul.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:41.590
I suppose you didn't
just run out for that.

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:48.848
No. Damn, I hate being
a foregone conclusion.

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:03.779
You live very well.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.031
Thank you.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.034
It'd be a shame
to lose it all.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.912
That depends on
a very large presumption.

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:14.123
Yes, it does.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.418
I won't back off,
you know.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:20.045
Not even for a minute.

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.924
I'd be hugely
disappointed if you did.

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.427
<i>How do porcupines mate?</i>

01:03:27.095 --> 01:03:29.138
Old joke. Very carefully.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:32.391
Carefully or
unsuccessfully.

01:03:32.893 --> 01:03:34.935
Don't see
many porcupines.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:37.813
Creatures with highly
evolved defense systems.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:39.231
Like porcupines.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:43.235
Like 42-year-old,
successful,
self-involved loners.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:48.199
If you've found
a female mirror image

01:03:48.283 --> 01:03:50.826
and think
you're going to form
a rewarding relationship...

01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:52.328
Think again?

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:04.882
Good morning.

01:04:06.635 --> 01:04:08.135
Nice dress.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:14.725
Looks like it
was a great party.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.815
You gonna be a cliché?

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:25.236
Did you even think twice?

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:26.654
No.

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.489
You knew what
you were doing.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:30.199
My job.

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.618
He likes me.
He'll keep liking me.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.245
Keep him right next to me.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.539
You don't care
what that makes you?

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.087
I know what I'm doing.

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:44.964
Do you really?

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:48.217
This is just
about money, Mike.

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:51.428
He's got a problem.

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:12.700
I could get used to this.

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:14.076
Just hold on now.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.286
Hold on? Why?

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.332
All right!

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:31.760
You're gonna
take the stick.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:32.803
Oh, I'm not taking...

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:33.887
Take the stick.

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:35.055
I'm not taking...

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.098
Put your hands
on the stick.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.182
Oh, no.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.690
Just put it right...
That's it. That's good.

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:46.442
- That's good.
- Oh, my God!

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:51.113
Head for that
hill over there.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.115
Head for the hill.
Don't lose it now.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:55.200
Don't lose it.
There you go.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:59.371
- This is ridge-running.
- We're doing it.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.623
This is great.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:01.874
I'm in your hands.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.960
Just feel that.
Feel that movement?

01:06:05.045 --> 01:06:06.045
I do.

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:11.508
To the left.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:19.224
Pick up a thermal
coming over the hill.

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:22.311
Just like a hawk.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:50.339
Cows.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:53.175
That's okay.
We're only about four
states from your car.

01:07:09.818 --> 01:07:12.528
That island
isn't Manhattan.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.113
It's not?

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.364
No.

01:07:15.824 --> 01:07:18.492
I have appointments.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.828
Wanna keep 'em?

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:05.873
Door's welded.
Throw your leg over.

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.333
Throw my leg over?

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.200
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.595
Oh,
this must go over.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.848
With whom?

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:48.350
Whomever you bring here.

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:51.435
I never bring anyone here.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:58.986
<i>Voilà.</i>

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.031
I bet they're
all my size, huh?

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:05.200
Could be. Might be off
a little here and there

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:08.036
but I think
they'll make do.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:10.539
I'll go make dinner.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:24.219
Come on.

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:25.387
You want some wine?

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:26.972
Yes.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:28.807
It's beautiful!

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.281
Wanna see it?

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.159
No.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:50.704
Are you sure?
I'm sure.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.415
Would you like a splash?

01:10:58.046 --> 01:10:59.504
Come here.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.353
Wanna see it?

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:20.442
No.

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:24.446
You sure?

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:29.868
You think I believe
you'd leave your hard-stolen
painting lying around a hut?

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:31.870
What if I did?

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.539
And that you'd tell me?

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:35.749
What if I trust you?

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.293
You know you can't.

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:39.878
You don't believe
it's possible

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.713
that you could
ever trust me, do you?

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:44.383
You know how likely
I think that is?

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.020
Excuse me.

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:18.583
Should I open
another bottle?

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.837
Yes.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:23.588
I think so.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:25.173
I think so.

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:26.717
The '85 wasn't very good.

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:29.386
No, it's...
it's not at all.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.013
Truce.
A truce would be good.

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:34.099
That'd be great.
That'd be good.

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:40.564
What was it?

01:12:42.108 --> 01:12:43.358
It's a nice little Renoir.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:44.651
Oh.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.030
Renoir.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:54.828
Nice little copy?

01:12:57.415 --> 01:12:59.541
We'll never know, will we?

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:01.043
Okay, I give up!

01:13:01.127 --> 01:13:02.502
Easy, easy.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.630
Think I'll get
that bottle.

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.174
Oh, yeah.
That would be good.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.471
Oh, you're not boring.
I'll give you that.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.716
You've complimented me.

01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:51.051
How?

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:52.928
They were bankers.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.346
Who?

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.348
Who? The suits.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:02.145
You're transferring assets,
getting ready to run.

01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:05.482
And suppose I did run?
Then what would you have?

01:14:05.566 --> 01:14:08.819
Not the painting,
not the $5 million
fee, not me.

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.237
Yes.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.201
Suppose I gave you 10.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:19.746
To fail?

01:14:27.755 --> 01:14:29.464
How would I hide it?

01:14:29.549 --> 01:14:31.007
I'd teach you.

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:45.397
You really think there's
happy ever after
for people like us?

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:52.279
So just how big
of a thief are you?

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:55.073
Well,
if you count Wall Street,

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:58.285
pretty big.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:04.416
If you mean art

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:09.296
I'm just an amateur.

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:13.466
Beginner's luck, huh?

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:16.803
Gentleman jockey
wins the derby.

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:18.805
Something like that.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:26.730
Well,
you got your hand caught
in the cookie jar now.

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.441
How are you gonna
get out of it?

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:34.571
It's just a game, love.

01:15:34.655 --> 01:15:36.615
Just a game.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:49.502
Nice tan.
Thanks.

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:51.713
Went to the beach
a couple days.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:53.381
On the job?

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:55.050
That's right.

01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:58.303
And did you pick anything up?

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:02.057
He's got an ornament
worn by Frederick Barbarossa

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:03.850
at his coronation in 1152.

01:16:04.185 --> 01:16:06.603
Really? Stolen?

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:09.898
No.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:13.652
So, that's it, huh,
after two days
and two nights?

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.030
That was it.

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:21.952
Would you like to know
where he was
the night before he left?

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:25.163
Or after he left
you last night?

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.627
Not really.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.464
Okay, suit yourself.

01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:37.676
Michael.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:58.113
She's...

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.496
...striking.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:11.835
He seems to think so.
Three dates in six days.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.725
Where does he find the time?

01:17:38.321 --> 01:17:39.904
You okay?

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:41.072
Yeah.

01:17:44.076 --> 01:17:46.369
You know,
I was okay once.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:52.751
My girlfriend got drunk.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:56.755
Stayed out all night,
came back in
the morning married.

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:03.011
I told people I didn't care

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:06.681
and then I fucked five women
in three days,

01:18:06.807 --> 01:18:09.684
flipped my car
on an on-ramp,

01:18:09.769 --> 01:18:13.605
beat a suspect unconscious,
got suspended.

01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:15.982
But I was okay.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:21.196
Is there a point
to this story?

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:28.453
They both had to come out
of the same building.

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:30.914
What's this?

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:32.457
Photos of the borders
of the Monet.

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:34.876
The borders?

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.253
Before insurers
indemnify a painting,

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:40.382
they remove it from the frame
and photograph the borders.

01:18:40.925 --> 01:18:42.509
Borders are never
seen in galleries

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:44.386
or auctions,
so if a picture is stolen

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:47.514
and someone tries to
pass off a forgery,
the borders won't match.

01:18:47.598 --> 01:18:50.016
And if the borders
do happen to match?

01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:53.019
Then the forger
was in the presence
of the original painting.

01:18:53.104 --> 01:18:56.189
So, if Crown's prank Monet
happens to be too good...

01:18:56.273 --> 01:19:00.193
Then we find the forger
and nail the bastard.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:01.820
How long
have you had these?

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:02.904
Five days.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:04.531
And you didn't open them?

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.908
Yeah, well,
they're open now.

01:19:23.843 --> 01:19:25.260
it's beautiful.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:28.430
You're not gonna say
"I couldn't possibly"?

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.432
No.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:35.854
I wouldn't say
anything that boring.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:47.073
She's an old friend,
but it'll be like
having dinner at a morgue.

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:51.578
You know, it occurred to me,
I might be able to bear it
if you came with me.

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:56.416
Tomorrow?
That's so soon.

01:19:58.169 --> 01:20:00.587
I sense hesitation.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:01.713
No.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:07.760
Do you find my
company monotonous?

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:09.971
No.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:11.848
Because I'd hate
to think you could.

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:17.687
What, be bored by you?
Require a little variety?

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.028
You're referring to Anna.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:29.949
They photographed
me with Anna.

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:31.784
You know,
that's your prerogative.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:34.954
I thought they were.
I let it happen.

01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:38.333
You wanna know why?
I'll tell you why.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:39.626
I don't want to know why.

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:40.710
I wanna tell you.

01:20:40.794 --> 01:20:42.253
You know what?
I don't wanna know why.

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:45.006
Jimmy,
I'd like to get out.
Jimmy, keep driving.

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:46.925
Jimmy, could you stop?

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.259
I don't wanna know why!

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:49.802
Just let me
tell you why!

01:20:53.724 --> 01:20:55.225
Now ask me why!

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:56.809
I don't wanna know!

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:58.436
You're upset about it.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:00.188
Yeah, because
that's what you wanted.

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:02.440
I needed you
to be upset.

01:21:02.650 --> 01:21:04.776
He's sadistic.
Who knew?

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:08.321
Did it occur to you
I needed to know?
Know what?

01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:11.324
Know whether
all it was to you
was the painting.

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:20.375
How else could I know?

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.296
What about you?

01:21:27.424 --> 01:21:32.011
I can leave here tomorrow.
So can you.

01:21:43.148 --> 01:21:44.524
We'd be fugitives.

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:46.651
Fugitives with means.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.404
All the difference
in the world.

01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:55.326
I don't know.

01:21:56.787 --> 01:21:58.037
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:03.042
Peter Pan decides to
grow up and finds
there's no place to land.

01:22:05.296 --> 01:22:08.590
The only sad part is,

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:11.926
if she's anything like you,

01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:14.971
she won't know
what she's lost
until it's gone.

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:23.896
Hey, let's go.

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:25.064
Where?

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:27.191
The painting's borders
match perfectly.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:32.071
Then again,
I'm sure you knew
that, didn't you?

01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:34.407
Come on.
Let's go meet some forgers.

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.784
I was never
an impressionist.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.912
Anyway, I pay taxes now.

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:41.748
Doing what?

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.333
Portraits.

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:46.836
Inserting the rich
into old masterpieces.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.881
The wife's face
on the Mona Lisa.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.216
From Brooklyn to Greenwich
in one generation,

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:54.636
you gotta have
the paintings to match.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.638
So, who did it?

01:22:58.098 --> 01:23:00.683
The German.

01:23:00.768 --> 01:23:02.477
Heinrich...

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:04.520
Knutzhorn.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.734
Art's a small world, Michael.

01:23:10.069 --> 01:23:12.779
So who do you
think did this?

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:22.914
Friedrich Golchan.

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.084
He said you did.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:29.962
So you think
if I want paint,
it just comes FedEx

01:23:30.047 --> 01:23:32.965
and the guards just
think it's therapy

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:37.679
while I madly copy a Monet
in my cell from the original?

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:47.563
What?

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:55.196
What?

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.823
Nothin'.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.199
What?

01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:02.286
I was just wondering
about what he wouldn't say.

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:04.956
Give.

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:07.667
There's nothing.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.085
You know what?

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:10.962
Life is full of
shitty conflicts, okay?

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.630
Give.

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:19.303
I just wondered if there
was a connection
between them, that's all.

01:24:20.139 --> 01:24:22.974
Between Crown
and that old man?

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.059
Yeah.

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:33.586
You are spooky.
You are really spooky.

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.630
They owned
a gallery together...

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:37.423
Crown and Knutzhorn.

01:25:37.508 --> 01:25:39.467
In Berlin, 1990.

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:42.762
And another one in Hamburg
and one in Paris in '94.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:47.767
You notice the one-man show
in Paris in '95?

01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:50.478
The artist is Knutzhorn.

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:52.146
So?

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:54.607
So look at the first name.

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:57.109
Tyrol Knutzhorn.

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:59.904
Yeah, we spoke to
a Heinrich.

01:26:02.366 --> 01:26:04.784
You know what it was?

01:26:04.868 --> 01:26:08.454
The way he smiled
at the painting?

01:26:08.539 --> 01:26:11.958
Pride. Paternal pride.

01:26:13.043 --> 01:26:14.961
I bet you it's his son.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:17.004
Son of a great forger

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:19.841
who paints as well as dad.

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:22.343
Just hasn't been
caught yet.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:26.514
Well, I assume if you look

01:26:26.598 --> 01:26:29.934
you'll find Tyrol Knutzhorn
lives in New York.

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:37.650
You know what? I...

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.988
I owe you an apology.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:45.658
I didn't think
you had the chops
to see this through.

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:46.868
Well, you don't know me.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:49.495
Yeah, but I should have.

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:51.247
I bet you'd stand
at the Pearly Gates

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:52.999
and kick St. Peter
right in the teeth

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:55.626
before you'd let
somebody play you.

01:27:00.090 --> 01:27:03.509
Harold, listen carefully,
and please don't interrupt.

01:27:03.594 --> 01:27:08.014
If I had to be gone,
and I mean seriously gone,
in about eight hours,

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.684
how much could
I take with me?

01:27:11.768 --> 01:27:13.686
<i>Are you all right?</i>

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:15.021
<i>You'll be taking</i>
<i>an enormous loss</i>

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:17.231
<i>if you liquidate</i>
<i>like this. Understand?</i>

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:20.026
I understand that,
and that can't be helped.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:22.028
But what could
I leave with?

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.949
<i>Call me back in an hour,</i>
<i>I'll have a number</i>
<i>for you of some kind.</i>

01:27:27.034 --> 01:27:28.326
Okay.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.718
Leavin' us?

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:51.432
No, you're not that lucky.
I'm organizing.

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:53.851
No Knutzhorn's
ever been to see
the old man.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:55.853
No?

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:02.401
There was a Knudsen, though,
three times last month.

01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:05.738
You think that's
just a coincidence?

01:28:05.822 --> 01:28:07.365
Could be.

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:09.575
Yeah.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.911
Probably is.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:18.626
Hmm.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:25.424
Look, here's an extra 100.
Just go, go!

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:29.428
Is he here?
He's in a meeting.

01:28:29.513 --> 01:28:30.721
It's very important.

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:33.099
Wait in the living room.
I'll get him.

01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:45.695
Ma'am, wait.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:56.414
I know we have
a plug adaptor. I saw it.

01:28:56.707 --> 01:28:58.541
I just can't find
the bloody plug adaptor.

01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:00.626
Would you go
downstairs and...

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:34.452
Well, we seem
to have backtracked.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.037
No.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.121
No.

01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:40.666
Take your hands off me!

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.835
What do you have
that's fresh?

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.754
Like who that girl is
and why she's here
every time...

01:29:44.838 --> 01:29:46.964
Anna works for me.

01:29:50.761 --> 01:29:52.636
Oh, you never thought
I was a fool before.

01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:53.929
She's here because
I owe her money

01:29:54.014 --> 01:29:55.389
and I wanted to pay her
before I go.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:59.351
Really? And what is
it she does for you?
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:02.730
I would be
compromising her to say.

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:05.149
Oh, Tommy,
you're going away together.

01:30:05.233 --> 01:30:07.151
No, I'm going with you.

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:15.201
Of all the things
in the world to take
with a leap of faith.

01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:18.621
How can I possibly
trust you?

01:30:18.705 --> 01:30:20.748
I'm not gonna ask that.

01:30:20.832 --> 01:30:23.459
I'm gonna trust you.

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:26.170
Isn't that what
you wanted, my trust?

01:30:27.464 --> 01:30:28.756
Tomorrow afternoon

01:30:29.674 --> 01:30:32.134
I'll put the Monet back.

01:30:37.516 --> 01:30:40.559
Where? Hanging back
on the wall in the museum?

01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:41.811
Yes.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:45.356
You know, Tommy,
I'm all checkmated out.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.358
If the painting's back,
we're free of it all.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:48.859
We're only for each other.

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:53.614
Back on the wall
in the museum?

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:55.199
Yes.

01:30:55.283 --> 01:30:58.285
And you'll meet me at 4:00

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:03.415
at the Wall Street Heliport
and we'll leave together.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.084
Or...

01:31:08.547 --> 01:31:11.799
Or you can have them
at the museum waiting for me.

01:31:16.012 --> 01:31:18.389
I'm trusting you.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:35.072
I can't.
I can't do that!

01:31:35.907 --> 01:31:38.784
Damn you,
you son of a bitch!

01:31:38.869 --> 01:31:40.786
Get away!

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:28.375
Hey.

01:32:29.586 --> 01:32:30.628
Hi.

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:35.549
I need to talk to you.

01:32:41.848 --> 01:32:43.432
<i>Paretti.</i>
Yeah.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:46.477
<i>You're in the lobby,</i>
<i>right?</i>

01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:48.604
Yeah, Mikey, I'm here.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:50.731
Me and about
30 other guys.

01:33:05.872 --> 01:33:09.041
Let up on yourself.
You did the right thing.

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:13.170
Assuming the
son of a bitch shows up.

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:31.272
Mark, stay
with the car.

01:33:31.356 --> 01:33:33.107
Get a uniformed man
on the fire escape.

01:33:33.191 --> 01:33:34.191
Got it.

01:33:34.985 --> 01:33:36.568
Detective.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:40.114
Yeah.

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:43.784
God damn it!
She leave anything behind?

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.452
Just stake out
the whole place.

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:47.121
Maybe she'll come back again.

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:49.248
No, no, no.

01:33:49.332 --> 01:33:52.084
Is Jack there?
Put Jack on the phone.

01:33:52.168 --> 01:33:54.545
Get Jack.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:57.506
What?
Forger.

01:33:57.590 --> 01:34:00.050
You didn't think
we just dropped that,
did you?

01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:01.468
Jack ran it down
this morning.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:02.886
It was a daughter,
not a son,

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:04.722
and she was under our
noses the whole time.

01:34:04.806 --> 01:34:08.809
Tyrol, Anna,
Knudsen, Knutzhorn,
whatever.

01:34:09.269 --> 01:34:11.729
Crown's known her
since she was 10.

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:15.524
When her father went to jail,
Crown became her guardian.

01:34:15.608 --> 01:34:17.735
Put her through college,
for Christ's sake.

01:34:18.653 --> 01:34:19.820
Now she works for
one of his companies.

01:34:19.904 --> 01:34:21.822
Jack, here's what
I want you to do.

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:24.366
He's in.
Got him.

01:34:24.617 --> 01:34:26.744
I'll call you back.

01:34:27.329 --> 01:34:28.662
That's him.

01:34:28.747 --> 01:34:31.498
Overcoat and briefcase.

01:34:31.583 --> 01:34:33.459
Yeah, Mikey, we got him.

01:34:33.543 --> 01:34:37.171
Center entrance.
Gray overcoat.

01:34:37.255 --> 01:34:40.090
Bring up the lobby
on the big monitor.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:44.762
Move in quietly.
We don't wanna make a scene.

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:46.722
Thomas.

01:34:59.444 --> 01:35:00.986
What the hell's he doin'?

01:35:01.071 --> 01:35:04.573
It's almost like he wants to
make sure that we see him.

01:35:08.495 --> 01:35:10.621
Let's play ball.

01:35:11.873 --> 01:35:14.875
There he goes. Bowler hat.
Move in and pick him up.

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.044
Go. Move it.

01:35:18.088 --> 01:35:20.297
Quietly. Excuse me.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.891
Excuse me.

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:38.065
Shit,
he switched the painting.
Stay with the painting.

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:40.776
What? I can't...

01:35:41.986 --> 01:35:43.821
Shit! There's another one.

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:52.788
Where is he?

01:35:52.872 --> 01:35:54.498
What the hell...

01:35:55.291 --> 01:35:56.583
There's guys
with bowler hats...

01:35:56.668 --> 01:35:59.002
All over the goddamn place.

01:36:02.632 --> 01:36:03.924
Did you warn him?

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:06.468
What? No. No!

01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:08.929
Then he knew you were
gonna betray him.

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:10.764
Shit. They're going
for the staircases.

01:36:10.849 --> 01:36:14.309
That does it.
Now we got four floors
to keep track of.

01:36:15.687 --> 01:36:17.771
Stay with him.
This man disappears,

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:20.149
it'll be 10 years
before he surfaces again.

01:36:20.692 --> 01:36:21.859
Is the impressionist wing
sealed off?

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:23.026
Completely.

01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:24.278
There's no way to get in?

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:25.946
Gates are down.
We got men on the roof.

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.197
If he tries to put
the painting back,

01:36:27.282 --> 01:36:29.491
I guarantee it won't be
in that room.

01:36:29.576 --> 01:36:31.368
Got 'em coming
out of the woodwork.

01:36:31.453 --> 01:36:32.786
What's the deal?

01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:38.876
<i>Oh, sinner man,</i>
<i>where you gonna run to?</i>

01:36:39.711 --> 01:36:42.880
<i>Oh, sinner man,</i>
<i>where you gonna run to?</i>

01:36:44.507 --> 01:36:48.552
<i>Where you gonna run to</i>
<i>all on that day?</i>

01:36:49.179 --> 01:36:50.762
<i>Will I run to the rock?</i>

01:36:51.681 --> 01:36:54.183
<i>Please hide me</i>
<i>I run to the rock</i>

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:56.185
He's going
the other way.

01:36:56.269 --> 01:36:58.353
<i>Please hide me</i>
<i>I run to the rock</i>

01:36:58.438 --> 01:37:01.857
<i>Please hide me</i>
<i>all on that day</i>

01:37:02.609 --> 01:37:04.318
<i>But the rock cried out</i>

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:07.488
<i>"I can't hide you"</i>
<i>The rock cried out</i>

01:37:07.572 --> 01:37:09.156
- What?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:10.949
What? I can't hear you.

01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:15.746
<i>I ain't gonna hide you</i>
<i>all on that day</i>

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.873
<i>I said "Rock,"</i>

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:20.959
<i>"What's the matter</i>
<i>with you, rock?</i>

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:24.755
<i>"Don't you see</i>
<i>I need you, rock"</i>

01:37:27.592 --> 01:37:29.593
<i>All on that day?</i>

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:32.221
<i>So I run to the river</i>

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:35.098
<i>It was bleeding</i>
<i>to run to the sea</i>

01:37:35.642 --> 01:37:37.226
<i>It was bleeding</i>
<i>to run to the sea</i>

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:40.938
This is ridiculous.
He's got us running
around in circles.

01:37:41.147 --> 01:37:43.065
<i>It was bleeding</i>
<i>all on that day</i>

01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:45.442
<i>So I run to the river</i>

01:37:45.527 --> 01:37:47.444
Paretti's trying
to reach you.

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:49.571
I know, you're fucked.
I'm coming down.

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:56.161
<i>It was boiling</i>
<i>all on that day</i>

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:58.872
<i>So I run to the Lord</i>

01:37:59.249 --> 01:38:01.416
<i>"Please help me, Lord"</i>

01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:05.128
<i>"Don't you see me praying?"</i>

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:07.965
What do we do?

01:38:08.049 --> 01:38:10.300
Start arresting people.
Come on.

01:38:12.095 --> 01:38:14.388
Excuse me, sir. One moment.

01:38:17.976 --> 01:38:20.102
Shit!

01:38:23.565 --> 01:38:25.649
<i>So I ran to the devil</i>

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:28.902
<i>He was waiting</i>
<i>I ran to the devil</i>

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:32.030
<i>He was waiting</i>
<i>I ran to the devil</i>

01:38:32.657 --> 01:38:35.993
<i>He was waiting</i>
<i>all on that day</i>

01:38:38.329 --> 01:38:40.998
I knew it. Excuse me.

01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:45.168
<i>Power</i>

01:38:47.088 --> 01:38:48.755
<i>Power</i>

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:56.013
<i>Oh, I run to the river</i>

01:38:57.098 --> 01:38:59.224
<i>It was boiling</i>
<i>I run to the sea</i>

01:38:59.892 --> 01:39:02.352
<i>It was boiling</i>
<i>I run to the sea</i>

01:39:03.146 --> 01:39:06.523
<i>It was boiling</i>
<i>all on that day</i>

01:39:07.191 --> 01:39:08.984
<i>So I ran to the Lord</i>

01:39:09.569 --> 01:39:12.404
<i>I said, "Lord, help me</i>

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:15.866
<i>"Please help me</i>

01:39:16.868 --> 01:39:19.703
<i>"Please help me</i>
<i>all on that day"</i>

01:39:21.664 --> 01:39:27.210
<i>He said, "Child,</i>
<i>where were you</i>

01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:31.298
<i>"When you ought to be praying</i>

01:39:32.884 --> 01:39:37.888
<i>I said, "Lord, Lord,</i>
<i>hear me praying, Lord, Lord</i>

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.391
<i>"Hear me praying, Lord, Lord</i>

01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:42.559
Coming through.

01:39:42.644 --> 01:39:45.062
Get the civilians
out of here.

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:49.399
<i>Sinner man,</i>
<i>you ought to be praying</i>

01:39:51.402 --> 01:39:54.112
<i>Ought to praying, sinner man</i>

01:39:54.781 --> 01:39:58.575
<i>Ought to praying</i>
<i>all on that day</i>

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:00.577
<i>Power</i>

01:40:00.745 --> 01:40:02.412
How do we get
this gate open?

01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:05.874
Kill the sprinklers
in the impressionist
wing now!

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:35.779
it's water paint.

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:38.490
it's been here
the whole time.

01:40:40.243 --> 01:40:44.037
From what, one, two days
after the robbery?

01:40:44.497 --> 01:40:47.124
There's something
jammed in the track.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:53.338
Returned the damn thing
practically as soon
as he stole it.

01:41:00.138 --> 01:41:02.013
Oh, Lord.
Oh, dear.

01:41:02.682 --> 01:41:06.810
This... This can't be.
It simply can't be.

01:41:07.478 --> 01:41:09.896
Now, how the hell
did he do that?

01:41:33.838 --> 01:41:35.797
Where are you goin'?

01:41:37.341 --> 01:41:39.968
Oh, office.

01:41:40.136 --> 01:41:41.970
Write up my report.

01:41:42.054 --> 01:41:44.014
The job's done, right?
Yeah.

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:50.020
So, the other painting,
why do you think he chose
that particular one?

01:41:51.397 --> 01:41:53.356
I have no idea.

01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:59.654
But it's not insured
by my people,
so I'm out of it.

01:42:00.907 --> 01:42:04.868
Obviously, you'll still
have to pursue it.

01:42:04.952 --> 01:42:07.162
I don't really give a shit.

01:42:09.707 --> 01:42:11.958
You don't care
if you catch him?

01:42:12.043 --> 01:42:14.669
I'll do what
they tell me to do.

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:18.423
Did you ever care?

01:42:18.508 --> 01:42:19.633
Yeah.

01:42:19.759 --> 01:42:22.052
He pissed me off.

01:42:22.136 --> 01:42:25.138
But look,
the week before I met you

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:27.974
I nailed two crooked
real estate agents

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:31.019
and a guy who was
beating his kids
to death.

01:42:32.063 --> 01:42:36.483
So, if some Houdini
wants to snatch
a couple swirls of paint

01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:40.403
that are really only
important to some
very silly rich people

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:43.907
I don't really
give a damn.

01:42:46.619 --> 01:42:48.578
You're a good man.

01:43:01.634 --> 01:43:04.135
Okay. Get out of here.

01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:06.805
And tell him
I said hello.

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.308
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:43:10.852 --> 01:43:12.727
Go on.

01:43:12.812 --> 01:43:14.688
And don't stiff us
for your phone bills.

01:43:15.898 --> 01:43:16.898
No.

01:43:21.112 --> 01:43:22.696
Taxi!

01:43:41.173 --> 01:43:43.717
You know,
I'm just gonna run.

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:45.135
Thanks.

01:43:54.312 --> 01:43:55.937
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

01:44:00.818 --> 01:44:02.986
You can't go out there
without an escort.

01:44:07.992 --> 01:44:09.451
Tommy!

01:44:17.001 --> 01:44:19.085
You would be Catherine?

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:20.462
Yes.

01:44:21.005 --> 01:44:23.214
He wanted you
to have this.

01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:31.306
Good day, ma'am.

01:44:55.748 --> 01:44:57.123
Hi, there.

01:44:57.959 --> 01:45:00.043
How can I help you?

01:45:00.878 --> 01:45:03.129
I have a reservation.

01:45:03.214 --> 01:45:05.882
Okay, Miss Banning.

01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:10.345
Will you be carrying
any luggage today?

01:45:11.430 --> 01:45:12.889
No.

01:45:17.228 --> 01:45:19.688
Can you see that this

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.986
gets to this man at
police headquarters?

01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:27.988
This should
take care of it.

01:45:30.074 --> 01:45:31.700
It won't get there
until the morning.

01:45:31.784 --> 01:45:33.201
That's fine.

01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:38.581
Departures for
international flights

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:40.709
are up the escalator
to your left.

01:45:41.919 --> 01:45:44.087
Ma'am,

01:45:44.588 --> 01:45:46.589
is everything all right?

01:45:48.134 --> 01:45:50.635
Everything's fine.

01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:48.860
You don't need to
cry there, lassie.

01:47:04.794 --> 01:47:07.212
Did you set this up?

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.634
Did you set this up?

01:47:12.718 --> 01:47:14.928
Did you set this up?
Did you?

01:47:15.012 --> 01:47:18.598
Miss, please,
the seat belt sign
is still on.

01:47:35.699 --> 01:47:37.867
I'll tell you what.

01:47:37.952 --> 01:47:40.328
You pull a stunt
like that again,

01:47:41.705 --> 01:47:44.332
I'll break
both your arms.

01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:06.229
<i>Round, like a circle</i>
<i>in a spiral</i>

01:48:07.022 --> 01:48:09.649
<i>Like a wheel within a wheel</i>

01:48:09.733 --> 01:48:11.901
<i>Never ending or beginning</i>

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:14.946
<i>On an ever spinning wheel</i>

01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:17.824
<i>Like a snowball</i>
<i>down a mountain</i>

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:20.410
<i>Or a carnival balloon</i>

01:48:20.494 --> 01:48:22.829
<i>Like a carousel that's turning</i>

01:48:22.913 --> 01:48:25.790
<i>Running rings around the moon</i>

01:48:25.875 --> 01:48:28.585
<i>Like a clock</i>
<i>whose hands are sweeping</i>

01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:31.254
<i>Past the minutes of its face</i>

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:33.965
<i>And the world is like an apple</i>

01:48:34.049 --> 01:48:36.509
<i>Whirling silently in space</i>

01:48:36.594 --> 01:48:39.095
<i>Like the circles that you find</i>

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:42.682
<i>In the windmills of your mind</i>

01:48:47.271 --> 01:48:50.023
<i>Like a tunnel that you follow</i>

01:48:50.107 --> 01:48:52.483
<i>To a tunnel of its own</i>

01:48:52.568 --> 01:48:55.445
<i>Down a hollow to a cavern</i>

01:48:55.529 --> 01:48:57.864
<i>Where the sun has never shone</i>

01:48:57.948 --> 01:49:00.867
<i>Like a door</i>
<i>that keeps revolving</i>

01:49:00.951 --> 01:49:03.453
<i>In a half forgotten dream</i>

01:49:03.537 --> 01:49:06.247
<i>Or the ripples from a pebble</i>

01:49:06.332 --> 01:49:08.875
<i>Someone tosses in a stream</i>

01:49:08.959 --> 01:49:11.586
<i>Like a clock</i>
<i>whose hands are sweeping</i>

01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:14.255
<i>Past the minutes of its face</i>

01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:17.008
<i>And the world is like an apple</i>

01:49:17.092 --> 01:49:19.636
<i>Whirling silently in space</i>

01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:22.263
<i>Like the circles that you find</i>

01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:26.267
<i>In the windmills of your mind</i>

01:49:30.439 --> 01:49:32.857
<i>Keys that jingle</i>
<i>in your pocket</i>

01:49:33.317 --> 01:49:35.568
<i>Words that jangle your head</i>

01:49:35.653 --> 01:49:38.571
<i>Why did summer go so quickly</i>

01:49:38.656 --> 01:49:41.074
<i>Was it something that you said</i>

01:49:41.158 --> 01:49:43.534
<i>Lovers walking along the shore</i>

01:49:43.661 --> 01:49:46.496
<i>Leave their footprints</i>
<i>in the sand</i>

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:49.123
<i>Was the sound</i>
<i>of distant drumming</i>

01:49:49.208 --> 01:49:51.793
<i>Just the fingers of your hand</i>

01:49:51.877 --> 01:49:54.587
<i>Pictures hanging in a hallway</i>

01:49:54.672 --> 01:49:57.257
<i>And a fragment of this song</i>

01:49:57.341 --> 01:50:00.051
<i>Half remembered</i>
<i>names and faces</i>

01:50:00.135 --> 01:50:02.679
<i>But to whom do they belong</i>

01:50:02.763 --> 01:50:05.515
<i>When you knew</i>
<i>that it was over</i>

01:50:05.599 --> 01:50:07.892
<i>Were you suddenly aware</i>

01:50:07.977 --> 01:50:10.770
<i>That the autumn leaves</i>
<i>were turning</i>

01:50:10.854 --> 01:50:13.398
<i>To the color of her hair</i>

01:50:13.482 --> 01:50:16.234
<i>Like a circle in a spiral</i>

01:50:16.318 --> 01:50:18.945
<i>Like a wheel within a wheel</i>

01:50:19.029 --> 01:50:21.447
<i>Never ending or beginning</i>

01:50:21.532 --> 01:50:24.284
<i>On an ever spinning wheel</i>

01:50:24.368 --> 01:50:26.995
<i>As the images unwind</i>

01:50:27.079 --> 01:50:29.372
<i>Like the circles that you find</i>

01:50:29.999 --> 01:50:34.043
<i>In the windmills of your mind</i>

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:45.972
<i>Pictures hanging in a hallway</i>

01:50:46.056 --> 01:50:48.308
<i>And the fragment of this song</i>

01:50:48.392 --> 01:50:51.311

01:50:56.567 --> 01:50:59.193
<i>Were you suddenly aware</i>

01:50:59.278 --> 01:51:01.946

01:51:02.031 --> 01:51:04.574
<i>To the color of her hair</i>

01:51:04.658 --> 01:51:07.410
<i>Like a circle in a spiral</i>

01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:10.121
<i>Like a wheel within a wheel</i>

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:12.665
