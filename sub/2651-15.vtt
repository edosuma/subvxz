00:04.668 --> 00:07.660
Clive Bixby.
What a sexy surprise.

00:07.787 --> 00:09.380
Quick question.
Hmm?

00:09.467 --> 00:11.583
Did it hurt
when you fell from heaven?

00:11.666 --> 00:13.464
Because you f-fell-

00:13.547 --> 00:15.026
I'm gonna come in again.

00:15.106 --> 00:16.858
We are watching baby Joe
on Valentine's Day,

00:16.986 --> 00:18.817
so my dad and Gloria can-
Make love.

00:18.905 --> 00:20.418
Ew. Don't.
Oh.

00:20.505 --> 00:22.098
The point is,
we are celebrating a day early.

00:22.225 --> 00:23.705
So they can finally
be intimate.

00:23.784 --> 00:25.423
You've... more than
made that point.

00:25.504 --> 00:27.222
I'm just saying,
it's a long wait after giving birth.

00:27.344 --> 00:28.777
Six weeks.
Ugh.

00:28.864 --> 00:30.695
I couldn't keep my hands off
this one for that long.

00:30.823 --> 00:34.180
I can only
imagine what Jay's going through.

00:36.261 --> 00:37.695
Voilà.

00:37.862 --> 00:41.331
Square knot. Impressive. I
can make any kind of knot.

00:41.421 --> 00:43.980
It's like I have
a sailor in my mouth.

00:44.061 --> 00:45.699
I should check on the kids.

00:45.781 --> 00:47.658
Haley took 'em to the movies.
She's not even gonna answer.

00:47.740 --> 00:49.696
I know, but, sweetie,
I have a good reason to worry.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.612
Luke had that nasty nosebleed
this morning,

00:51.699 --> 00:53.530
and Alex, as usual, fainted.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.258
She's fine,
and Dunphy men get nosebleeds.

00:55.338 --> 00:57.852
I told you this when we got married.
It was in my vows.

00:57.937 --> 01:00.327
I'm still a little unclear as to
why you put them in your vows-

01:00.418 --> 01:03.296
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:03.376 --> 01:04.935
You should finish that drink,
pretty lady.

01:05.016 --> 01:06.575
We got a big night ahead of us.

01:06.656 --> 01:08.136
Okay.

01:08.216 --> 01:10.094
First, we have a date with romance.

01:10.216 --> 01:12.446
A threesome, if you will.
Oh.

01:12.535 --> 01:14.844
From here, we move on
to an old-fashioned blimpnic.

01:14.975 --> 01:18.172
Now is that the one where the man
has to face out, but the woman-

01:18.254 --> 01:20.563
It's a picnic on a blimp.

01:20.694 --> 01:22.174
Hmm.
Champagne, cheese...

01:22.253 --> 01:23.926
and this beautiful city
beneath us.

01:24.013 --> 01:26.208
That actually sounds
really romantic.

01:26.292 --> 01:29.763
After that, we swap
our earplugs for some earmuffs,

01:29.852 --> 01:32.845
take a few moonlit turns
around the local ice rink.

01:32.931 --> 01:34.412
Oh.

01:34.531 --> 01:38.286
From there, it's a quick trip
back to the hotel, where-

01:38.411 --> 01:40.800
- I'm spinning.
- I wouldn't start with that,

01:40.890 --> 01:43.563
but, uh, we-
we can work our way up to it.

01:43.649 --> 01:45.402
No. I'm feeling really weird.

01:45.490 --> 01:48.163
Can't shock Clive.
Just tell me what you want.

01:48.288 --> 01:50.803
Juliana?

01:50.889 --> 01:52.208
Claire?

01:52.287 --> 01:54.086
One of you needs to answer me.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.263
♪ Hey, hey ♪

02:03.925 --> 02:04.962
♪ Hey♪ ♪

02:07.326 --> 02:09.839
Blood pressure's still good.

02:09.924 --> 02:11.439
I think I can send you home.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.635
Great. So it was probably
just low blood sugar or something.

02:13.724 --> 02:15.681
See, honey? I told you
it was nothing to worry about.

02:15.764 --> 02:17.197
Well, it's not nothing.

02:17.283 --> 02:18.796
You did have
a small heart episode.

02:18.883 --> 02:20.556
Dr. Coben,
this may have been my fault.

02:20.642 --> 02:23.282
I think I was being... too sexy.

02:24.401 --> 02:26.040
Yeah, I don't think
that's an issue.

02:26.122 --> 02:29.557
- You sure about that?
- Um, Doctor, you're not saying...

02:29.640 --> 02:31.519
that I had a heart attack
or something, right?

02:31.601 --> 02:33.797
Not at all. What you have is
a very minor arrhythmia...

02:33.881 --> 02:35.916
known as Wolff-Parkinson-White
syndrome.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.635
It's hereditary,
so you're off the hook.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.278
Oh, yeah.
My mom has that.

02:40.358 --> 02:42.999
We'll treat it with medication
and have you back in a couple of days.

02:43.078 --> 02:44.559
In the meantime,
just take it easy.

02:44.638 --> 02:46.310
Okay. Thank you.

02:46.397 --> 02:48.993
Guess we should tell your dad
we can't watch the baby tomorrow.

02:49.077 --> 02:50.194
No. No.

02:50.277 --> 02:51.877
I don't want everyone
to know about this.

02:51.956 --> 02:54.916
They're just gonna get worried and-and
make a bigger deal of it than it is.

02:54.956 --> 02:56.470
Sweetheart, promise me.

02:56.556 --> 02:58.866
I promise.
I know it's not that big a deal.

02:58.955 --> 03:01.471
This is a huge deal-

03:02.394 --> 03:04.033
for which I'm partly responsible,

03:04.114 --> 03:06.709
in spite of what Claire's
lesbian doctor says.

03:06.794 --> 03:09.593
Hey, honey, I was just reading
about this Wolff-White thing.

03:09.673 --> 03:12.268
It's not that serious.
You're gonna be fine.

03:12.353 --> 03:13.867
I know.

03:15.832 --> 03:17.313
Who's ready to hit the ice?

03:17.433 --> 03:21.187
- What?
- Come on. Somebody promised me a moonlit skate.

03:21.271 --> 03:23.351
But didn't the doctor say
you needed to take it easy?

03:23.432 --> 03:25.183
That's just one of those things
they have to say,

03:25.311 --> 03:27.462
like, "You can't drink when
you're pregnant."

03:27.551 --> 03:29.906
Come on. We're not gonna seriously
blow off Valentine's Day, are we?

03:29.990 --> 03:33.903
No. I just thought,
why... ice things down...

03:33.990 --> 03:35.900
when we could heat things up?

03:36.029 --> 03:38.907
Oh, I like where this is going.
Right?

03:38.989 --> 03:40.468
Right?
I do. Yes.

03:40.548 --> 03:42.186
Yeah?
Ye-No!

03:42.267 --> 03:43.748
Honey, I know what you're doing.

03:43.827 --> 03:45.307
You're treating me like a patient,

03:45.427 --> 03:46.986
and you promised that you wouldn't.
No.

03:47.107 --> 03:49.747
No, no, no, no, no. I just
had a better idea. What?

03:49.867 --> 03:53.142
Side-by-side couples massage.
Oh.

03:53.225 --> 03:56.183
Just you, me and a couple Cambodian
guys to work us over good.

03:56.264 --> 03:58.222
Specific.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.057
What is that?

04:00.185 --> 04:02.140
You think the kids are home?

04:02.223 --> 04:03.704
That sounds like
more than our three.

04:05.464 --> 04:09.251
Oh. Oh, they think we're not home,
and they're having a party.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.579
I'm killing them. No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

04:11.703 --> 04:14.297
"A," it's my turn to kill them.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.380
"B," you need to order up
those massages. Mm-hmm.

04:17.461 --> 04:20.180
It's under Best Number One U.S.A.
Coca-Cola Good-Time Massage.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.776
What the hell is going on?

04:25.860 --> 04:27.453
Dad? What are you doing home?

04:27.540 --> 04:30.339
This is how it is? We're gone for a
minute, and you guys throw a party?

04:30.419 --> 04:32.614
No! Just texted Mom we're having
a good time at the movies.

04:32.698 --> 04:34.211
Works every t-
Aaah!

04:34.298 --> 04:36.254
- So this is a regular thing?
- No!

04:36.337 --> 04:38.533
You know the drill.
Coolers out b-aah-ack!

04:38.658 --> 04:41.047
Enough. Turn off the music!

04:41.136 --> 04:42.934
Everybody who I did not create,

04:43.017 --> 04:44.689
get out of my house right now!

04:45.455 --> 04:46.969
I don't want to get upset.

04:47.055 --> 04:49.490
- I've been through enough tonight.
- What happened?

04:49.575 --> 04:51.406
I'm not supposed to tell you.

04:51.494 --> 04:55.249
- When you say it like that, we make it worse in our heads.
- Fine. It's no big deal.

04:55.334 --> 04:57.212
Your mother had to go
to the hospital.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.854
Oh, my God! That is so much worse
than it would be in our heads!

04:59.933 --> 05:02.653
She's fine. She just passed out a little.
Something to do with her heart.

05:02.773 --> 05:04.286
Like a heart attack?
Mom had a heart attack?

05:04.413 --> 05:06.449
Mom almost died of a heart attack?
No!

05:06.533 --> 05:09.366
She had a little episode,
probably triggered by me.

05:09.451 --> 05:11.090
She just needs to rest.

05:11.172 --> 05:12.810
For once,
let's not think about ourselves.

05:12.851 --> 05:14.843
Phil, everything okay?

05:14.930 --> 05:16.490
Fine! I'm coming.

05:16.610 --> 05:18.521
Just act like
everything's normal.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.569
Oh, and if, uh, two Cambodian guys
show up, send them to our bedroom.

05:27.409 --> 05:30.879
Kids had a few friends over.
I handled it.

05:30.968 --> 05:33.244
So you're good
at handling things.

05:35.686 --> 05:39.396
You like? Me love, but is this
appropriate massage wear?

05:39.485 --> 05:42.319
They were busy-which is
what we should be getting.

05:42.406 --> 05:46.035
Honey. Honey, are you sure
this is okay for your-

05:46.165 --> 05:48.157
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

05:48.324 --> 05:50.759
Ooh! Salty.
I still have a few moves.

05:50.844 --> 05:52.039
It's the chips, sweetie.

05:52.164 --> 05:53.517
Oh, sorry.
Right.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.754
Mmm.

05:54.844 --> 05:56.913
Mom, we need to talk to you.

05:57.003 --> 05:58.721
Dad told us
not to say anything,

05:58.802 --> 06:00.521
but we're really worried
about you.

06:00.643 --> 06:01.871
You told them?
No!

06:02.001 --> 06:03.481
- You had a heart attack?
- Phil!

06:03.561 --> 06:06.918
That is not what I said.
Kids, everything is fine.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.480
You're
covered in blood!

06:08.560 --> 06:09.995
Her heart exploded!

06:10.120 --> 06:12.111
Oh, my God! I did it again!
Phil, it's your nose.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.515
Oh. This
is the one thing-

06:14.599 --> 06:17.831
The one thing I asked from you is
not to make a big deal of this,

06:17.959 --> 06:20.428
and you couldn't even do that.
Honey, you need to stay calm.

06:20.558 --> 06:22.151
No, I don't, because I am fine.

06:22.238 --> 06:24.275
We are all fine.

06:24.357 --> 06:27.316
Oh, God. Haley,
revive your sister.

06:33.516 --> 06:35.235
Not in the mood
for an apology, Phil.

06:35.315 --> 06:38.194
Good, 'cause you're not gettin' one.
I'm allowed to worry about you.

06:38.276 --> 06:41.195
Mm-hmm. Yeah, when there's something to worry about.
But this was nothing.

06:41.314 --> 06:43.705
I told you, my mom has this.
Which I just found out about today.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.944
How has that not come up
in 20 years?

06:46.033 --> 06:47.627
I was... getting to it.

06:47.714 --> 06:50.307
I know you feel like you have to
be the rock for this family...

06:50.393 --> 06:52.907
and worry about everybody's
boy problems and nosebleeds...

06:52.993 --> 06:54.905
and... who has enough greens.

06:55.031 --> 06:57.830
They're supposed to cover half the plate.
Claire, stop it.

06:57.911 --> 07:01.187
I'm saying you could let us
take care of you every once in a while.

07:01.271 --> 07:04.821
Like, for example, when you
clutch your chest and collapse.

07:05.870 --> 07:07.589
This house isn't gonna
crumble into dust...

07:07.669 --> 07:09.388
if you let yourself be vulnerable.

07:09.510 --> 07:12.103
We don't know that.
We could find out.

07:15.749 --> 07:18.058
It was kind of scary.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.383
Of course.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.500
Until I knew what it was,
and then-Don't ruin it.

07:26.507 --> 07:29.465
I just have one more question.
Hmm?

07:29.585 --> 07:32.180
Did it hurt-
Well, I blacked out before I-

07:32.266 --> 07:34.620
when you fell from heaven?

07:34.705 --> 07:36.822
Nailed it.

07:44.102 --> 07:46.334
You just take care of Claire.
We got Joe.

07:46.422 --> 07:47.981
Gloria?

07:48.063 --> 07:49.575
¿ Sí, mi amor?

07:49.661 --> 07:51.937
Wow. Happy Valentine's-

07:52.021 --> 07:53.502
Wait, wait, wait. Time out.

07:53.581 --> 07:55.378
That was Phil.
They can't watch Joe today.

07:55.501 --> 07:58.460
Claire was in the emergency
room last night. Is she okay?

07:58.540 --> 08:00.531
She's gonna be fine,
but she had a little bit-

08:00.620 --> 08:02.611
Okay, good. I love how
you look in this suit.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.452
Let's see how it looks
on the floor, okay?

08:04.539 --> 08:06.496
Okay, but I gotta be
in a meeting in one hour.

08:06.578 --> 08:08.615
Ay, that's so cute-
that after six weeks,

08:08.739 --> 08:11.457
you think you're going to need an hour!

08:11.537 --> 08:13.416
Happy Valentine's Day!

08:13.498 --> 08:17.016
It's the one time of the year when the world
tries to be as romantic as I am all the time.

08:17.057 --> 08:19.208
- Good luck, world.
- Get out.

08:19.297 --> 08:20.935
Anyway, since you're
almost done dressing Jay,

08:21.016 --> 08:22.734
how about
we head to school early?

08:22.816 --> 08:25.092
I'll check my hair
and meet you in the car.

08:26.895 --> 08:29.284
Gloria, I'll be back
in two hours, tops.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.048
We decide who does what
when you come back.

08:34.893 --> 08:36.613
I got a ticket running a red light-

08:36.693 --> 08:38.331
So let's make this worth it.

08:38.412 --> 08:40.881
- Put the kid down.
- I can't. He's being a real Pritchett.

08:40.972 --> 08:42.691
We need to come up
with a different term for that.

08:42.812 --> 08:45.646
Watch.

08:45.732 --> 08:47.324
Watch.

08:48.971 --> 08:50.690
I used to have a TV
got reception like that.

08:50.770 --> 08:53.683
Let me try.
Hey, Joe-Joe. Hey, buddy.

08:53.851 --> 08:56.125
- Guy to guy, you're blocking me a little bit.
- You know that.

08:56.210 --> 08:58.929
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do, Joe.

08:59.009 --> 09:01.843
Hey, how 'bout a half hour?
What do you say, pal? Huh?

09:01.928 --> 09:03.363
Can you do it?

09:03.449 --> 09:05.200
Attaboy.

09:05.328 --> 09:08.400
I've never been more attracted to you.
Prove it.

09:08.527 --> 09:09.961
Are you kissing?

09:10.088 --> 09:12.521
That's a bit of a mood killer.
My daddies kiss a lot.

09:12.607 --> 09:14.087
And flatlined.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.964
Mitch and Cam are
having a party for Valentine's.

09:17.045 --> 09:20.722
Claire was supposed to take
care of her, but now she can't.

09:20.805 --> 09:24.275
Lily, we're so happy
to have you here.

09:24.365 --> 09:26.436
I have a big surprise for you.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.834
Look. A brand-new,
shiny TV remote.

09:28.923 --> 09:30.437
Looks complicated.

09:30.523 --> 09:33.118
Just keep hitting all those buttons
until something good happens.

09:33.203 --> 09:35.001
That's my plan anyway.

09:35.083 --> 09:36.483
Woof!

09:36.603 --> 09:39.117
Where were all these distractions...

09:39.202 --> 09:41.159
the night that Joe was conceived?

09:41.242 --> 09:43.153
I'm kidding. He's a blessing.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.361
Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm Harlan.

09:47.441 --> 09:49.272
I'm here to do
your baby proofing.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.874
Jay, I've been waiting
for this appointment for weeks.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.599
I've waited longer for mine.

09:53.679 --> 09:56.034
The human race has survived
for a thousand years...

09:56.119 --> 09:58.714
without these foam bumpers
and-and gates ever here.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.478
Hell, I used to drive
to the supermarket...

10:00.517 --> 10:02.397
with Mitchell and Claire
on the hood of the car.

10:02.478 --> 10:04.674
When did everybody
get so overprotective?

10:04.756 --> 10:07.226
Maybe when kids
started flying off cars.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.746
How long? Normally I
have help, but Dale, uh-

10:09.837 --> 10:12.192
You met Dale at the shop.
He's a tall guy. He's my sister's kid-

10:12.275 --> 10:14.596
Listen. You and I are gonna
bang this out in about an hour.

10:16.955 --> 10:18.435
Where do you want it?

10:21.273 --> 10:23.425
I know a lot of people
think that I'm attracted to Jay...

10:23.513 --> 10:26.312
because of his money,
but they're wrong.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.907
I am attracted to him
because he's sexy,

10:28.992 --> 10:31.588
and he's never been sexier
than today.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.265
The suit,

10:33.352 --> 10:35.389
the carrying of the boxes-

10:35.472 --> 10:36.905
No, no. You listen to me.

10:36.991 --> 10:38.788
You've had my wife's car
four days.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.827
Figure out what
that screeching noise is,

10:40.910 --> 10:42.583
or you'll be making one yourself.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.341
The yelling on the phone-

10:46.430 --> 10:48.306
Give me that.

10:52.028 --> 10:53.747
And the drilling.

10:53.828 --> 10:55.785
So much drilling.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.304
Time to go, Harlan. Okay. You want me
to walk you through any of this stuff?

10:59.427 --> 11:01.100
No, we'll take it from here.
Okay. Uh, listen.

11:01.187 --> 11:04.266
Give me a call if you have any trouble with the gates.
They're a little tricky.

11:04.307 --> 11:05.945
Yeah.
Gotta be gentle with-

11:06.025 --> 11:08.256
Ten seconds,
or I start without you.

11:08.346 --> 11:10.813
Ready or not, here I-

11:10.945 --> 11:12.379
Come on!
Okay, you have to lift it.

11:12.545 --> 11:15.263
It's not a lift. It's a squeeze.
Okay, then squeeze it!

11:15.344 --> 11:17.381
I'm squeezing it! It's impossible.

11:17.464 --> 11:18.944
Jay, please.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.377
Best day ever!

11:22.463 --> 11:25.261
I just got invited to a Valentine's
party by a secret admirer.

11:25.382 --> 11:27.374
You should go.
Sounds great. Go.

11:27.462 --> 11:28.976
I obviously need
to get dressed first.

11:29.141 --> 11:31.576
Can you keep it under a half hour?
You're funny.

11:34.101 --> 11:35.979
Manny, come on. Let's go.

11:36.061 --> 11:38.973
Relax. You don't have to drive me.
It's just down the street.

11:39.060 --> 11:41.335
Oh, I thought I... had to drive you.

11:42.539 --> 11:44.496
What's with the hat?

11:44.579 --> 11:47.775
My secret admirer requested I
wear a hat with a feather in it.

11:47.897 --> 11:50.288
I'm, like, "Which one?"
Really?

11:50.377 --> 11:53.098
This secret admirer
have any other requests?

11:53.217 --> 11:56.813
Uh, yes. She asked me to bring some
poetry to recite at the party.

11:56.896 --> 12:01.334
Mm-hmm.
These, uh, kids at the party-

12:01.416 --> 12:04.009
they wouldn't be the popular ones,
by any chance?

12:04.095 --> 12:05.768
The most popular. Why?

12:06.854 --> 12:08.926
No reason. Just... have fun.

12:09.014 --> 12:10.527
I will.

12:19.492 --> 12:21.609
No, Jay.

12:21.692 --> 12:23.172
Squeeze.

12:27.451 --> 12:29.841
No!

12:32.090 --> 12:35.527
What? I have cigar breath?
It's not you.

12:35.609 --> 12:37.565
Ay, did you already-

12:37.648 --> 12:39.208
What?

12:39.289 --> 12:40.848
No!

12:40.929 --> 12:42.805
No. I'm worried about Manny.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.404
I think he's being set up
for some kind of humiliation at that party.

12:46.487 --> 12:49.047
Ay, that's so sweet
of you to worry.

12:49.167 --> 12:52.125
Just when I thought
that you couldn't get any sexier.

12:52.246 --> 12:53.680
Yeah, he's fine, right?
Yeah, he's fine.

12:55.485 --> 12:57.523
Come here.

12:57.605 --> 12:59.358
Oh, I think I gotta check on him.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.437
It was something about
some kind of secret admirer...

13:02.565 --> 13:04.396
getting him to-
Bring his poems?

13:04.483 --> 13:08.363
Yeah, he told me
when I was lint-rolling his jacket.

13:08.444 --> 13:09.957
And you're not worried
it's a prank?

13:10.043 --> 13:11.682
Of course I worry.

13:11.762 --> 13:14.198
I worry about him all the time.

13:14.283 --> 13:17.673
But like you said, we can't
protect them from everything.

13:17.761 --> 13:20.321
So I'm just trying to, like,
let go a little bit.

13:20.480 --> 13:23.951
Let him ride on top of the car?
No, that's just crazy.

13:25.281 --> 13:27.157
That's the hardest part, isn't it?

13:28.639 --> 13:31.598
When you realize you can't stop
the world from hurtin' them.

13:31.679 --> 13:34.877
Now you're making me
want to cry.

13:34.998 --> 13:37.751
This is not what this day is all about.
You're right.

13:37.837 --> 13:40.717
Okay. I'll go and get us
some champagne.

13:40.798 --> 13:42.311
Good idea.

13:47.796 --> 13:49.548
Manny?

13:49.635 --> 13:53.105
No, nothing. Just wanted to
know if everything is okay.

13:53.195 --> 13:56.472
Hi, honey. Sorry to bother you.
I know you're resting.

13:56.594 --> 13:59.063
I heard you had
a little scare last night.

13:59.154 --> 14:01.907
Hey, uh, when are you
going back to the doctor?

14:01.993 --> 14:03.871
'Cause if you want,
I can go with you.

14:13.192 --> 14:14.944
This year, for Valentine's Day,

14:15.031 --> 14:18.229
we decided to throw a lonely hearts
party for all of our single friends.

14:18.311 --> 14:19.743
Sometimes when
we're around them,

14:19.829 --> 14:22.299
we feel a little guilty
for having found each other,

14:22.390 --> 14:25.665
like we're waving our love
in their faces.

14:25.748 --> 14:27.785
There's gotta be a better way
of saying that.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.064
Anyway, it was supposed to be
an elegant affair.

14:30.908 --> 14:32.136
Ogle me.

14:32.227 --> 14:33.866
Showtime!

14:33.987 --> 14:35.422
♪ ♪ Put the cat away.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.020
Okay. Yeah, right.
Oh, and, Mitchell, please-Hey.

14:37.147 --> 14:38.865
Yeah.
Please try to have fun tonight.

14:38.986 --> 14:40.784
I always have fun.
No, I know you're great...

14:40.866 --> 14:43.061
at stay-at-home fun
and sit-on-the-couch fun,

14:43.186 --> 14:45.257
but this is party fun, and
sometimes-Okay, this is not fun.

14:45.386 --> 14:46.864
Get the door.

14:48.824 --> 14:50.896
Fun. I will show you some fun.

14:54.544 --> 14:56.660
Things got a little hazy after that.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.373
Hello?

15:05.461 --> 15:07.533
Yeah, h-hi, Dad.

15:07.621 --> 15:09.816
No, no. I'm up. I am up.

15:09.901 --> 15:11.335
Yeah, bring her by at any time.

15:11.460 --> 15:13.532
Okay. Good night.

15:13.661 --> 15:15.412
Oh, Cam.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.060
Oh, God, that was
some party last night.

15:18.140 --> 15:20.938
Yeah. Well, I'm just glad
you made it home safely.

15:21.019 --> 15:23.932
I don't even
remember leaving the party.

15:24.019 --> 15:26.054
Oh, I-I think I got a little tipsy.

15:26.138 --> 15:28.606
Tipsy? You were like
all of the madmen.

15:28.697 --> 15:30.130
Oh, no, no, no.

15:30.216 --> 15:33.414
Don't make it out like
I did a lot of crazy, out of control-

15:34.417 --> 15:36.806
I was hoping I dreamt that.
Mmm.

15:36.896 --> 15:38.614
Come on. Like you've never
had a few cocktails...

15:38.695 --> 15:40.415
and dyed a cat pink
with cherry Kool-Aid.

15:40.496 --> 15:43.169
Okay. Well, is there anything else
you need to tell me about?

15:43.255 --> 15:45.087
Not that I remember.

15:46.453 --> 15:49.207
I'm remembering this.
Oh, my gosh, Mitchell.

15:49.294 --> 15:51.650
Are these Burt and Dottie Winchell's
Christmas decorations?

15:51.773 --> 15:54.606
- How could you?
- They never take them down, okay?

15:54.732 --> 15:56.725
I was doing
the whole neighborhood a favor.

15:56.812 --> 15:58.849
Oh, God. Cam, I-

15:58.931 --> 16:01.048
You know, I think-
I think there are pictures.

16:01.132 --> 16:04.089
I remember Pepper
and Longinus were-Okay.

16:04.210 --> 16:05.724
Mmm. Oh, my gosh.

16:05.850 --> 16:08.689
Those poor reindeer. Oh, it seems that
Prancer is the belle of the ball.

16:08.770 --> 16:10.203
No surprise there.

16:10.329 --> 16:12.002
Oh. You must be Vixen.

16:12.089 --> 16:13.761
Okay. Okay.
Not funny, Mitchell.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.318
Look at this place.
What were you thinking?

16:16.409 --> 16:17.842
Okay. Cam, I-

16:17.928 --> 16:20.158
Yes, I went a little nuts,
all right? I-I'm sorry.

16:20.248 --> 16:22.604
But I didn't do anything
that can't be undone.

16:22.687 --> 16:24.565
Hey, roomies.

16:24.647 --> 16:27.560
Hey, thank you so much
for letting me move in here.

16:28.606 --> 16:30.278
Um-

16:30.366 --> 16:33.882
Yes. Could you excuse us
for just a-a moment, Dylan?

16:33.965 --> 16:35.524
Yeah. Take as much time
as you need.

16:35.604 --> 16:38.564
It's your house. I just live here now.

16:38.684 --> 16:40.959
Cam, did-did I tell him
that he could live with us?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.313
Obviously.
Oh, my God.

16:42.404 --> 16:43.884
Was he even at our party?

16:43.963 --> 16:46.033
Yes. He's been driving a limousine
for some company,

16:46.123 --> 16:48.115
and J'Marcus hired him for the night,
and now he lives here.

16:48.243 --> 16:50.802
Are you all caught up there?
I don't remember any of this.

16:50.883 --> 16:52.873
Well, let's create a new memory,
one where you tell him...

16:53.002 --> 16:54.913
he can't live here.
Oh.

16:55.002 --> 16:57.037
Can I say one short thing?

16:57.161 --> 16:59.277
I came to this house a broken man...

16:59.361 --> 17:01.670
after my mom threw me out
for her new boyfriend,

17:01.761 --> 17:04.752
and then I found out I was getting
let go from the limo company...

17:04.839 --> 17:07.718
the same night Haley
goes to a party without me.

17:07.798 --> 17:11.348
So I had nothing and no one.

17:11.439 --> 17:13.348
And then you-

17:13.478 --> 17:16.277
Okay, come on. Tell him.
Let him finish.

17:16.357 --> 17:21.034
I'm sorry. I mean, gay dudes
have always been nice to me-

17:21.116 --> 17:22.631
I mean, super nice-

17:22.717 --> 17:24.708
but nothing like this.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.991
I guess what I'm trying to say is-

17:27.075 --> 17:28.634
Oh, my God. He's gonna sing.

17:28.716 --> 17:33.345
So many years living
life underwater

17:33.435 --> 17:37.553
Came up for air in the
room of your daughter

17:37.633 --> 17:42.263
I never knew I would
find my answer

17:42.352 --> 17:45.743
In my ex-girlfriend's
uncles' house

17:45.831 --> 17:51.509
With the tiny pink panther

17:51.590 --> 17:53.423
Dylan, Dylan. I'm sorry.

17:53.511 --> 17:55.548
Oh, gosh. This is-

17:55.630 --> 18:00.546
This is really hard for me to say,
but we-we just cannot...

18:00.670 --> 18:02.900
not wash our cat.

18:02.989 --> 18:04.388
I'm sorry.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.057
And yet, when I did that drunk,
not a scratch.

18:09.147 --> 18:12.266
Oh, my gosh. This place is
cleaner than when we moved in.

18:12.387 --> 18:13.946
I know. Best house guest ever.

18:14.027 --> 18:16.382
No, we are not keeping him.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.935
Do you think he took the Christmas
decorations back to the Winchells'?

18:19.026 --> 18:20.539
Oh, well, I think
he thinks he did.

18:20.666 --> 18:21.825
What? Okay, yeah.

18:21.865 --> 18:23.380
Dylan! Dylan! Dylan!

18:23.466 --> 18:26.139
- No, no, no.
- Oh, hey, guys. I'm up here.

18:26.225 --> 18:27.705
Yeah, hi. Listen, Dylan.

18:27.784 --> 18:31.459
Those decorations
were on the yard of that house.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.456
Oh. No good deed, huh?

18:33.543 --> 18:35.340
Yeah, well.

18:35.423 --> 18:38.574
Hey! I can see
our house from here.

18:38.663 --> 18:40.096
Uh! Oh!

18:40.222 --> 18:41.941
- Oh, geez. Are you kidding me?
- Dylan!

18:42.061 --> 18:43.337
This day-

18:43.422 --> 18:46.060
One night.
Just till his bone sets.

18:46.140 --> 18:49.053
Yeah, but there's always gonna be
a reason not to tell him, isn't there?

18:49.140 --> 18:51.779
- Okay. What if we, um-
- No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

18:51.859 --> 18:54.135
No "we." You made your bed.
You lie in it.

18:54.220 --> 18:57.018
- Don't lie there. I just made it.
- I'm sorry.

18:57.098 --> 18:59.010
Not looking. Not looking.

18:59.098 --> 19:01.454
- It's okay, Dylan.
- I made you guys some soups.

19:01.537 --> 19:03.052
Oh, Dylan,
you didn't have to do that.

19:03.178 --> 19:05.931
Well, Cam didn't have to offer
to let me stay here, but he did.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.093
So, here are soups.

19:08.177 --> 19:09.657
Cam offered?

19:09.737 --> 19:11.932
Well, I know he was speaking
for both of you.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.850
You weren't home yet.
Is that a problem?

19:14.936 --> 19:17.131
Not for me.

19:17.216 --> 19:19.604
Oh. Dylan, can you give us
just a moment?

19:19.735 --> 19:21.886
Not looking. Not looking.

19:21.975 --> 19:23.930
I'll get it.

19:24.014 --> 19:27.563
So I guess in a
way, we're both responsible.

19:27.654 --> 19:30.771
Yeah, but in the real way,
you're responsible.

19:31.852 --> 19:33.332
Take care of that.

19:33.453 --> 19:35.444
Come on. Let's do it.

19:35.531 --> 19:37.171
Oh, my God.
I hate myself right now.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.886
What kind of monster throws an
injured innocent onto the street?

19:39.971 --> 19:42.202
You can't live here.
Get out!

19:42.290 --> 19:43.691
Lily!
Lily.

19:43.770 --> 19:45.442
It's weird. You're a big boy.

19:45.569 --> 19:47.003
I'm sorry, Dylan.
She doesn't mean that.

19:47.129 --> 19:49.519
No. She's right.
Everyone says it.

19:49.609 --> 19:51.839
I need to stop
running from conflict.

19:51.969 --> 19:54.200
It's time to be a big boy
and patch things up...

19:54.288 --> 19:56.722
and move back in with my mom.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.327
I'll get my things.

19:58.408 --> 19:59.807
Okay. We're sorry.
Sorry.

19:59.847 --> 20:01.043
Yeah.

20:03.447 --> 20:06.836
I guess I got off easy.
She is blunt, but effective.

20:06.926 --> 20:08.804
Maybe we should have her
talk to the gardener.

20:08.886 --> 20:10.717
Hey, C-Cam, um-

20:10.805 --> 20:12.602
Do you really think
that I'm not any fun?

20:12.685 --> 20:14.677
- What?
- Last night, you said that I-

20:14.764 --> 20:16.517
This isn't a hotel!

20:16.604 --> 20:18.596
Yeah, you made
your point, honey.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.357
He's got it.

20:20.444 --> 20:22.832
I only drank like that last night...

20:22.923 --> 20:25.040
because I-
I was trying to be more fun.

20:25.163 --> 20:27.802
Oh. No, I didn't mean it like that.

20:27.883 --> 20:29.396
I'm sorry.

20:29.482 --> 20:31.242
You know I have party anxiety.
I was nervous.

20:31.321 --> 20:32.801
No, but you're not entirely wrong.

20:32.882 --> 20:36.670
I mean, I could be
a little less... uptight...

20:36.800 --> 20:38.315
and loosen up a little bit.
Yeah.

20:38.401 --> 20:42.552
Maybe we could, you know,
aim for middle-ground fun.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.517
You know, if you're up
for a do-over,

20:44.598 --> 20:47.592
I recently heard of an idea
that could put us in the low end...

20:47.719 --> 20:51.314
of upper middle-ground fun.
Okay.

20:53.958 --> 20:55.913
Do you believe
in love at first sight,

20:55.997 --> 20:57.988
or should I walk in again?

21:01.035 --> 21:04.347
Jay?
Coming, honey. Oh, God.

21:04.436 --> 21:06.585
There you are, Jay.
I thought you'd never wake up.

21:06.675 --> 21:08.267
Turns out my night
with my secret admirer...

21:08.354 --> 21:09.789
couldn't have gone better.

21:09.875 --> 21:12.992
We danced all night.
And the best part was, her eyes were just-

21:13.073 --> 21:14.985
Manny, Manny-Dying to hear it.

21:15.073 --> 21:17.541
Wait 10 seconds and come in
and tell both of us.

21:17.633 --> 21:20.865
Jay, you took so long.
I'm not done with you.

21:20.953 --> 21:23.830
I'm not done with you either.

21:23.952 --> 21:26.103
Best Valentine's party ever.

21:26.192 --> 21:29.581
So there's this girl-
I should start from the beginning.

21:29.671 --> 21:31.708
All right.
So first a little history-
