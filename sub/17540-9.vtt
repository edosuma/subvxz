00:12.345 --> 00:14.579
Long time, no see, Zevon.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.048
Zevon?

00:16.083 --> 00:18.216
Sounds like
a laundry detergent, right?

00:18.251 --> 00:19.885
No doubt you've heard
of my mother, Yzma,

00:19.920 --> 00:23.422
but today, my evil machilations
will rival her own!

00:23.457 --> 00:25.390
I think you mean machinations.

00:25.425 --> 00:27.526
Don't be so condescendinating.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.594
Wait. So how did you
get off the isle?

00:29.629 --> 00:31.229
It was all thanks to Mal.

00:31.264 --> 00:34.266
(gasp)
Audrey was right!
Mal was behind all this!

00:34.301 --> 00:37.436
No. I would like to think
she came back for me.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.572
I always imagined
there was a... spark
between us.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.340
(clearing throat)
The island?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.176
Oh! Right.
So two days ago,

00:44.211 --> 00:45.510
when Mal came to the isle,

00:45.545 --> 00:50.248
<i>she opened the protective dome</i>
<i>for a few precious seconds.</i>

00:50.283 --> 00:53.452
<i>I was watching.</i>
<i>Not that I... sit around</i>
<i>and watch Mal.</i>

00:53.487 --> 00:56.755
<i>It's just, uh...</i>
<i>anyway, when she finally</i>
<i>left the isle,</i>

00:56.790 --> 00:59.391
<i>I boldly slipped out</i>
<i>as the dome was opened.</i>

01:00.327 --> 01:01.593
(splashing)

01:01.628 --> 01:03.428
And you swam
all the way here?

01:03.463 --> 01:05.263
No! Just part of the way.

01:05.298 --> 01:06.965
Then I got a ride
with a friend.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.400
Ahoy!

01:08.435 --> 01:09.701
All:
CJ?

01:09.736 --> 01:10.869
What are you doin' here?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.405
Hi, guys! Did I tell you
I got my own ship?

01:13.440 --> 01:16.441
Well, more of a rowboat
actually, but it's a start.

01:16.476 --> 01:17.742
Hey, cutie.
(squeak)

01:17.777 --> 01:18.977
I gave Zevon a ride

01:19.012 --> 01:21.413
in exchange for a full
50-foot schooner.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.048
When he takes over Auradon.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.116
Takes over?

01:24.151 --> 01:25.584
You? Please.

01:25.619 --> 01:26.618
Wait. Why?

01:26.653 --> 01:28.987
To fulfill
my family's destiny!

01:29.022 --> 01:30.489
To rule an empire!

01:30.524 --> 01:32.390
Auradon will be mine!

01:32.425 --> 01:33.425
Hey, that's
dad's scepter.

01:33.460 --> 01:34.960
That should be
in the museum.

01:34.995 --> 01:38.063
No. It belongs in the hands
of King Zevon!

01:38.098 --> 01:39.331
Not if we can stop you!

01:39.366 --> 01:40.432
Ba-bam!

01:40.467 --> 01:42.067
(scream)
Whoa!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.802
-Hey!
-Whoa...
(confused sounds)

01:43.837 --> 01:46.104
Guess it's time
for the potion portion
of the show.

01:46.139 --> 01:50.442
The school's chemistry lab
had nearly all the ingredients
I desired.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.443
Jane:
Try running backwards!

01:51.478 --> 01:52.811
Carlos:
Let's get 'em!

01:52.846 --> 01:54.079
Ba-boom!

01:54.114 --> 01:57.282
(boom)
(making spinning noises)

01:57.317 --> 02:00.118
As fun as this is,
I have a kingdom
to take over,

02:00.153 --> 02:01.753
so... ka-bow!

02:01.788 --> 02:04.322
(screams, whoas)

02:04.357 --> 02:05.857
(laughing)

02:05.892 --> 02:08.326
(all shouting at once)
Help! Put us down!

02:08.361 --> 02:10.362
Oh, look how little you are!

02:10.397 --> 02:11.496
Especially Carlos.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.298
(voices inside lamp)
<i> Let us outta here!</i>

02:13.333 --> 02:16.935
Well, I'm gonna go
get a good seat
for the hostile takeover.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.305
Hah!
I'll be back
when the dust settles!

02:20.340 --> 02:21.907
Now for the jewels.

02:26.713 --> 02:27.779
What?

02:27.814 --> 02:30.182
Gone?

02:30.217 --> 02:32.417
Looks like I'll have to crash
the jewel-bilee!
