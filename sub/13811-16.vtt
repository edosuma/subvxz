Jackets!

01:05.440 --> 01:06.608
It's cold out there.

you heard Raymundo.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.585
{\an8}Put on your jackets.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.420
Why do you always
have to be so...

01:27.504 --> 01:29.130
So what, bro?

01:29.214 --> 01:30.590
{\an1}So Reggie.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.426
{\an5}TWISTER:
Yeah, why do you
have to be

01:33.510 --> 01:35.386
so... Reggie, Reggie?

01:35.470 --> 01:37.180
You mean boring?

01:37.263 --> 01:38.848
Uh, not boring.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.350
Uh, predictable.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.059
But in
a sensible way.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.894
Which is a good thing.

01:42.977 --> 01:46.356
You're always...
you're always...

01:46.439 --> 01:47.315

Awesome!

{\an1}Missy the Missile?
Who's that?

{\an1}So radical, she wears
a piranha around her neck.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.555
She rocks.
She's my role model.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.682
Your
role model?

02:20.765 --> 02:21.391
Yeah, right.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.058
{\an1}You're nothing
like her.

02:22.141 --> 02:25.395
Oh, right, I forgot.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.896
I'm just boring old Reggie.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.191
Well, we'll just see about that.

02:36.906 --> 02:39.242
{\an1}Come on, dudes,
what's the holdup?

02:39.325 --> 02:41.619
{\an5}Um, maybe we shouldn't
do an advanced trail
on our first ride.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.955
Right, Reg?

02:44.038 --> 02:46.249
{\an1}I don't know what you guys
are looking at me for.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.918
The slope is that way.

Whoo-hoo!

03:03.975 --> 03:06.269
Whoa, easy,
girlfriend!

03:14.986 --> 03:15.945
{\an1}Uh, sorry.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.113
{\an1}Sorry.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.698
It's cool. It's cool, girl.
I been there.

I mean... you're not...?

Missy the Missile?

03:25.496 --> 03:26.831
In the house!

03:26.915 --> 03:27.707
{\an1}Really?!

03:27.790 --> 03:30.919
{\an1}Man, this is like
a total honor!

03:31.002 --> 03:33.004
{\an1}And that's really a piranha
around your neck?

03:33.087 --> 03:34.297
It's my mojo, girl.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.965
Reminds me to be
aggressive.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.135
But I guess <i> you</i> wouldn't
need reminding of that.

03:39.218 --> 03:39.719
You're like me
when I was your age, girl.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.930
You're wacked!

03:42.013 --> 03:44.140
Wow! Thanks!

03:44.223 --> 03:46.643
So... what's your
name, homegirl?

03:46.726 --> 03:48.811
Reggie. Reggie Rocket.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.981
{\an3}Well, I guess that, like,
makes you Reggie <i> the</i> Rocket.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.318
Uh, yeah, I guess it does.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.863
{\an1}Well, catch you later...
Reggie the Rocket.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.700
Reggie... the Rocket.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.162
Dudes, this race is
gonna be mine!

04:06.245 --> 04:08.247
I'm going totally silk.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.165
{\an1}Oh, yeah?

04:09.248 --> 04:10.458
You better look out

04:10.541 --> 04:13.461
{\an1}'cause Reggie the Rocket
is in the hay-ouse!

04:13.544 --> 04:17.507
And you're gonna
eat my snow dust!

04:17.589 --> 04:19.550
Reggie the Rocket?

04:19.634 --> 04:21.636
In the hay-ouse?

04:25.765 --> 04:28.393
{\an1}Man, don't you wish
we could go in there?

04:28.476 --> 04:29.560
What's stopping us?

04:29.644 --> 04:33.272
Oh, I don't know, gee...
a six-foot-tall fence.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.193
So, what do you think
climbing's for?

04:37.276 --> 04:39.028
{\an1}Yeah, Squid, what do you
think climbing's for?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.322
Let's go get our stuff.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.075

Cannonball!

04:49.080 --> 04:50.289

04:55.795 --> 04:57.296

04:58.548 --> 05:02.593
See? Reggie the Rocket
feels no pain.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.096
Out!
All of you, now!

05:09.684 --> 05:11.394
(<i> Tito sings fanfare</i> )

05:11.477 --> 05:13.563
Rainbow trout and lychee nuts.

It's an old family recipe.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.903
What do you got for
dessert, Tito man?

05:20.987 --> 05:24.240
Oh, but I caught these fish
myself, little cuz.

05:24.323 --> 05:25.908
Just have a taste.

05:25.992 --> 05:27.660
Uh, maybe later.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.245
Only boring people think

05:29.328 --> 05:30.371
{\an1}they have to have
dinner first.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.958
And maybe I shouldn't
bore my little cousins

05:34.042 --> 05:35.376
with dinner at all.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.127
Whatever!

05:36.210 --> 05:38.755
Hey, if everybody
gives me

05:38.838 --> 05:40.089
their fish
when they're done,

05:40.173 --> 05:43.468

with the bones.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.178
Whoa.

When did she get so gnarly?

06:00.943 --> 06:02.487
That's what I'm
telling you, bro.

It's a whole new Reggie.

-Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
-She's gone nuts.

Hey, Sammy.

What's that over there?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.004
Hey, those are mine!

07:02.088 --> 07:04.799
Want 'em back? Ah...

07:04.882 --> 07:07.593
Hmm... nah.

07:07.677 --> 07:10.221
You're not Reggie.
Who are you?

07:10.304 --> 07:12.515
Yeah, you're, like, totally...
un-you.

07:12.598 --> 07:17.186
Well, maybe you, like,
totally don't know me.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.355
I'm going back
for another run.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.691
How about if your old man
goes with you?

07:21.774 --> 07:24.443
I don't want anybody
cramping my style.

07:24.527 --> 07:29.991
Oh. Then, uh... can you at least
meet us back at the car at 3:30?

07:30.074 --> 07:31.742
Okay, Rocket Girl?

07:31.826 --> 07:32.994
Sure. Whatever.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.454
What's up with Reggie?

07:35.538 --> 07:36.038
Don't know, brother.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.291
Maybe the altitude.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.043
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

07:41.127 --> 07:42.962

Whoo-hoo!

07:57.685 --> 07:58.978
Man, where is she?

07:59.061 --> 08:01.522
We could have busted
a few more runs.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.858
Yeah, we could have been
shredding.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.818
I hope she's okay.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.197
Reggie the Rocket
does what she wants.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.241
Whoo-hoo!

08:12.325 --> 08:14.577
Maybe I should go talk
to the ski patrol.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.078
Let's go back to
the cabin, brother.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.705
Reggie is a smart <i> wahini.</i>

08:17.788 --> 08:19.624
Maybe she left a message.

08:27.715 --> 08:28.841
{\an1}Are you all right,
Reg?

08:28.925 --> 08:30.092
BOTH:
Where were you?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.428
Working on my mogul technique.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.431
The trick is to be
real aggressive.

08:35.514 --> 08:37.725
Did you stop to think
we might be worried?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.645
{\an1}Reggie the Rocket
can take care of herself!

08:40.727 --> 08:42.270
This isn't like you, Reg.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.774
When you say you're gonna
do something, you do it.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.692
Like the ancient
Hawaiians say.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.196
{\an3}"He who misses the tide
must wait for the next moon."

08:50.279 --> 08:52.281
I do what I want,
so deal with it.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.076
-Whoa, Reg.
-Whoa.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.912
No, you don't just
do what you want.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.122
{\an3}I'll tell you right now
one thing you're <i> not</i> doing

09:00.206 --> 09:01.666
is competing
tomorrow.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.125
What?!

09:11.884 --> 09:13.844
What are you guys looking at?!

09:20.601 --> 09:21.811
Hey, what's up, Reg?

09:21.894 --> 09:23.646
How about a little
warm-up ride with old Miss?

09:23.729 --> 09:24.855
{\an1}I'm there!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.315
Cool necklace...

09:26.399 --> 09:26.691
Uh, thanks.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.079
Looking good, girl.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.455
You should shred up
your division.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.999
Yeah,<i> should.</i>

09:43.082 --> 09:43.708
What's that mean?

09:43.791 --> 09:45.042
My dad won't let me race.

09:45.126 --> 09:48.170
He got all wigged out
'cause I was late to meet him.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.380
Weak, huh?

09:49.463 --> 09:50.506
That's rough.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.675
They just don't get
Reggie the Rocket.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.552
I'm supposed to be
all boring and sensible.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.847
{\an1}Well, if you're, like,
so wild and radical,

09:57.930 --> 09:59.849
{\an1}why don't you just bust out
and race anyway, girl?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.143
{\an1}I mean, what do you care
what your father says?

10:02.226 --> 10:04.312
I don't know.

10:04.395 --> 10:07.732
Because... well, because...

10:07.815 --> 10:09.191
Because you <i> do</i> care.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.693
Yeah... I guess I do.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.529
{\an1}That's definitely what
it sounds like to me, girl.

10:13.612 --> 10:15.281
{\an1}So why don't you just
try being yourself?

10:15.364 --> 10:16.574
I mean, that's what I do.

10:16.657 --> 10:19.327
{\an1}That's more important than
wearing a fish around your neck.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.831
Hey, you want to keep this?

10:23.914 --> 10:25.458
I would be honored.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.544
{\an1}Later!

10:38.137 --> 10:39.430
Thanks, Reg.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.598
{\an3}No prob.

10:40.681 --> 10:41.766
Hey, guys...

10:41.849 --> 10:43.017
Can I talk to you a sec?

10:43.100 --> 10:44.185
Sorry about, you know,

10:44.268 --> 10:46.479
acting like a dork.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.065
I was just so afraid
I was boring.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.858
You mean a total dork.

10:50.941 --> 10:51.859
Full on.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.819
{\an1}Mm-hmm.
Definitely a dork.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.905
But not boring!

10:55.988 --> 10:57.406
ANNOUNCER:
Attention!

10:57.490 --> 11:00.868
Will all racers please report
to the starting line?

11:00.951 --> 11:02.787
The race begins in two minutes.

11:02.870 --> 11:07.416
-I'm sorry to you guys, too.
-No worries, cuz.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.086
Next time, I'll be there
when I say.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.922
I know, Rocket Girl.

11:13.005 --> 11:16.592
Here... I was saving it
just in case.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.928
Wow! Thanks, Raymundo!

11:19.720 --> 11:22.598
Well, what are you waiting for?

11:22.681 --> 11:23.891
Get on your bike!

11:31.690 --> 11:32.733
(<i> crowd cheers</i> )

11:42.201 --> 11:44.120
(<i> crowd cheers</i> )

11:44.203 --> 11:45.788
Whoo! Go, Reggie Rocket!

11:45.871 --> 11:46.705
Take it, girl!

11:47.873 --> 11:50.584
(<i> whooping and cheering...</i> )

12:12.106 --> 12:14.483
{\an8}Dude! Sam and Reg
are totally lagging.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.152
{\an8}Are they gonna show
or what?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.487
{\an8}I know, man.
This is weak.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.489
{\an7}Too bad
they're not firemen.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.242
{\an7}'Cause then we could pull that
alarm and they'd rush over.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.120
{\an8}Twist, that's the lamest
thing I've ever heard.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.204
{\an8}Nothing's on fire.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.372
The thing
wouldn't go off.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.167
There doesn't have to be
a fire for it to work.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.002
Twist, trust me.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.464
{\an3}If there's no fire when you pull
that thing, nothing happens.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.174
I think you're wrong, Otto.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.341
Dude, here, I'll show you.

12:39.425 --> 12:40.509
No, Otto, don't!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.386
(<i> alarm sounding...</i> )

12:42.470 --> 12:44.597
(<i> beeping...</i> )

12:44.680 --> 12:45.181
(<i> alarm continues...</i> )

12:45.264 --> 12:47.183
Oh, man!

12:49.435 --> 12:50.686
(<i> siren wailing...</i> )

12:50.769 --> 12:53.189
Cool! Where's the fire?
Where is it?

12:53.272 --> 12:55.524
(<i> laughs</i> )

12:55.608 --> 12:56.484
Everybody out!

12:56.567 --> 12:58.194
Hawaiians
and children first!

12:58.277 --> 12:59.445
{\an1}Where is it?!
What's going on?!

12:59.528 --> 13:00.446
Who pulled... huh?

13:00.529 --> 13:03.282
Wait a minute, there's
no fire out here.

13:03.365 --> 13:06.243
Well, then,
who pulled the alarm?

13:06.327 --> 13:08.704
What's everybody looking
at me for?

13:08.787 --> 13:09.788
(<i> siren wailing...</i> )

13:13.125 --> 13:14.543
I told you.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.838
Man, you pick the worst time
to be right about stuff.

13:17.922 --> 13:18.589
We got to get out of here!

13:18.672 --> 13:23.010
(<i> siren wailing</i> )

13:27.640 --> 13:29.225
Hey, what's going on?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.936
{\an1}Lars pulled
the fire alarm!

13:32.019 --> 13:33.604
BOTH:
Lars?!

13:33.687 --> 13:35.940
{\an1}Dude... ultimate bust.
(<i> laughs</i> )

13:36.023 --> 13:37.316
There's nothing funny
about this, Twister.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.194
Lars is in real trouble.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.863
Pulling a false alarm
is pretty serious.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.200
Yeah, Twist, Lars
is totally going down.

13:46.283 --> 13:46.992
Yup.
(<i> laughs</i> )

13:48.661 --> 13:51.455
How come nobody believes me?!

13:51.539 --> 13:53.832
I'm telling you,
I didn't do nothing.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.919
<i>If I had a nickel for every</i>
<i>civilian in an orange vest</i>

13:57.002 --> 13:59.004
<i>who claims he</i>
<i>"didn't do nothing,"</i>

13:59.088 --> 14:00.839
{\an3}<i>I could buy</i>
<i>this beach!</i>

14:00.923 --> 14:03.592
<i>Now, commence pickup!</i>

14:05.761 --> 14:07.596
Oh, man!

14:10.349 --> 14:11.767
TWISTER:
Lars is in megatrouble.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.477
{\an1}He's got to wear
this lame orange vest

14:13.561 --> 14:16.438
{\an1}and do all sorts of
community service all week.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.607
{\an1}After everything
he's gotten away with,

14:18.691 --> 14:21.443
it's good to see him
finally get busted.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.947
Yeah! It is about time
he gets busted for something.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.296
Whoo-hoo!

14:43.924 --> 14:45.676
Totally twisted!

14:48.220 --> 14:49.179
Steady...

14:53.684 --> 14:55.769
Oh! Aah! Whoa...
(<i> grunts</i> )

14:55.853 --> 14:59.106
(<i> panting and grunting</i> )

15:00.774 --> 15:02.192
Do you guys find it strange

15:02.276 --> 15:03.652
that Lars would pull that alarm

15:03.736 --> 15:05.029
and then just stand there?

15:05.112 --> 15:06.780
He's a strange guy.

15:06.864 --> 15:07.990
I mean,
just a theory,

15:08.073 --> 15:09.575
but I think
that Lars may be

15:09.658 --> 15:10.409
the fall guy to
a second puller.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.453
A second puller?

15:12.536 --> 15:13.787
Heh. Come on, Sam.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.998
Who else would have
done it?

15:16.081 --> 15:18.292
Yeah, only Lars would be
lame enough

15:18.375 --> 15:20.502
to do something that
full-blown stupid.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.339
Huh. Just a theory.

15:26.008 --> 15:26.967
{\an1}Yo, Twist.

15:27.051 --> 15:27.593
Our secret is cool, right?

15:27.676 --> 15:29.762
Don't worry, bro.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.972
You pulled the alarm,
and Lars get busted.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.641
What could be
better than that?

15:33.724 --> 15:35.851
{\an5}BOTH:
Woogedy, woogedy,
woogedy, woogedy.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.437
All right, flan!

15:38.520 --> 15:41.023
Hey, where's mine?

15:41.106 --> 15:41.982
Sorry,<i> mijo.</i>

15:42.066 --> 15:44.068
No treats for you tonight.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.361
Huh?

15:45.444 --> 15:47.696
Lars, we are
very disappointed in you.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.865
{\an3}No dessert this week,
and you're going to miss

15:49.948 --> 15:52.034
our trip to the water park
on Saturday.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.952
What?!
But I didn't do nothing!

15:54.036 --> 15:56.747
Man, my own family
doesn't believe me!

16:01.293 --> 16:03.379
SAM:
So... you were on your way

16:03.462 --> 16:04.505
to sneak into
the Ortega Theater.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.257
{\an1}Yeah, and the Shore Shack
was going all crazy,

16:07.341 --> 16:08.592
so I ran in
to check it out.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.469
Interesting...
and what time was the movie

16:10.552 --> 16:11.428
supposed to start?

16:11.512 --> 16:13.430
I don't know, man.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.181
Just get
away from me!

16:14.264 --> 16:15.683
{\an1}Come on, Sam,
let's go.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.228
He obviously did it.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.354
No, I didn't!

16:20.437 --> 16:21.647
Write that down.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.903
{\an1}Keeps getting sweeter,
huh, Twist?

16:27.986 --> 16:29.113
Lars painting Madtown...

16:29.196 --> 16:33.283
{\an1}your folks giving me his ticket
to the water park...

16:33.367 --> 16:35.077
Dude, I'm
starting to think

16:35.160 --> 16:36.078
this is kind of
messed up.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.247
Maybe we should
tell the truth.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.457
What?!
Hey, you were there, too.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.084
We'd both get busted.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.336
{\an1}Don't get all lame
on me, bro.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.630
{\an1}Let's just have
a good time.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.049
No worries, right?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.509
Yeah...

16:50.592 --> 16:51.677
{\an1}I guess.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.262
Hey, Lars,
check it out.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.180
{\an1}We found this big bag of hair
in back of the barbershop.

16:55.264 --> 17:00.144
And we're gonna...
(<i> mumbles</i> )

17:00.227 --> 17:02.187
Oh, sweet!

17:02.271 --> 17:05.190
{\an4}CONROY:
No, no, no, no.
Sorry, man...

17:05.273 --> 17:06.275
{\an1}but Lars is booked
for the day.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.236
{\an1}You see, he's got
all these walls to paint.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.200
Man, I didn't even do nothing.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.626
If my second puller theory
is correct,

17:24.710 --> 17:27.713
{\an5}the timeline I'm
putting together should
help expose the truth.

17:27.796 --> 17:30.340
Sam, what does it matter?!

17:30.424 --> 17:32.634
Even if Lars didn't do it,
he deserves to get busted

17:32.718 --> 17:35.012
{\an1}'cause of all the other stuff
he's done, right?

17:35.095 --> 17:38.015
{\an5}I don't know.
If someone else
did pull that alarm,

17:38.098 --> 17:40.058
it would be
pretty messed up.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.478
Yeah.
I sort of agree with Reggie.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.772
Uh...

17:47.232 --> 17:49.651
{\an1}And you come straight home
after work today, you hear me?

17:49.735 --> 17:52.696
Aw, Mom,
but Pi and Sputz

17:52.780 --> 17:53.655
{\an3}found this bag of hair
yesterday, and we were gonna...

17:53.739 --> 17:56.283
Lars! Straight home!

17:58.952 --> 18:01.663
Shoot, man...
I didn't even do nothing.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.374
Harsh.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.754
Here you are.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.339
Oh, and, Reg, Otto?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.758
I won't need your help at
the Shack today after all.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.843
Cool!

18:12.841 --> 18:14.843
All right!

18:14.927 --> 18:18.680
Hey, those fish patties I'm
unpacking smell kind of funny.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.182
(<i> coughs</i> )
-Lars.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.683
You're working here today?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.686
Yup. He'll be covering
for you and Reg.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.355
So I'd eat somewhere
else if I were you.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.233
Uh...

18:29.316 --> 18:31.944
I sometimes forget
what good kids you are.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.531
{\an3}Well, this should be good
for a few laughs, huh?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.908
Yeah...

18:37.991 --> 18:39.034
Whoa!

18:39.117 --> 18:41.912
Oh, man!
Uh, sorry, Raymundo.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.915
That's okay, Rocket Boy.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.668
Lars!
Can you come clean this up?

18:48.210 --> 18:48.877
You make a mess,

18:48.961 --> 18:51.547
and I got to clean it up?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.216
(<i> growls</i> )

18:54.299 --> 18:55.968
I'm sorry, Lars, uh...

18:56.051 --> 18:57.803
I, I didn't mean to.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.848
What's his problem?

19:00.931 --> 19:03.183
Like he's never dropped
a shake before.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.601
Yeah... I know...

19:04.685 --> 19:05.894
What a kook...

19:05.978 --> 19:08.897
If my second puller
theory is true,

19:08.981 --> 19:11.358
it involves a
cover-up so extensive

19:11.441 --> 19:15.612
it may rock the very foundation
of Ocean Shores!

19:15.696 --> 19:17.239
Oh, Sammy...

19:19.992 --> 19:21.702
Are you sure about this,
Otto?

19:21.785 --> 19:24.037
It's foolproof.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.999
This way, we clear Lars,
you and I don't get busted,

19:27.082 --> 19:28.458
and everything's cool again.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.502
{\an5}Give me your hat, dude.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.502
(<i> ringing</i> )

19:30.586 --> 19:31.753
It's ringing.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.797
(<i> ringing</i> )

19:33.881 --> 19:35.424
{\an1}Ocean Shores
police station.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.427
{\an5}(<i> deep voice</i> ):
Hi. I'm calling to
confess a crime.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.387
{\an1}Okay...

19:40.470 --> 19:41.597
(<i> clears throat</i> )

19:41.680 --> 19:44.349
I pulled a fire alarm
down at the Shore Shack,

19:44.433 --> 19:46.935
and my name is
not Lars Rodriguez.

19:47.019 --> 19:47.895
{\an1}Now, let me get this
straight.

19:47.978 --> 19:50.939
Your name is not
Lars Rodriguez.

19:51.023 --> 19:51.648
Uh, that is correct.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.776
I'm not Lars.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.028
Mm-hmm...

19:56.111 --> 19:59.531
Well, thank you, person
who is not Lars Rodriguez.

20:03.535 --> 20:04.620
Dude, it totally worked!

20:04.703 --> 20:07.497
I bet she's on the phone
with your mom right now,

20:07.581 --> 20:09.458
telling her
Lars didn't do it.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.918
BOTH:
Woogedy-woogedy-woogedy...

20:11.001 --> 20:11.793
(<i> both laugh</i> )

20:11.877 --> 20:12.419
BOTH:
Yeah!

20:18.467 --> 20:21.011
Uh-oh.
Now what did Lars do?

20:22.387 --> 20:25.766
You called Officer Shirley
pretending to be someone else.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.850
No, I'm telling you, man.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.644
I don't know
what you're talking about!

20:28.727 --> 20:30.646
{\an1}Lars, you've
only made things

20:30.729 --> 20:33.065
{\an1}ten times worse
for yourself.

20:33.148 --> 20:36.485
{\an1}This whole thing is a mystery
wrapped up in a riddle.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.236
(<i> siren whoops</i> )

20:38.320 --> 20:41.156
Oh, man, Otto.
Now what?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.407
Man, this is wacked!

20:47.037 --> 20:50.165
Oh, today is going
to be such fun.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.333
Yeah... fun.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.046
Yeah... this is
gonna be great.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.339
And, Lars...

20:57.422 --> 20:59.341
we'll be back later
to pick you up.

21:04.346 --> 21:08.517
{\an1}Okay, Lars, today you're
on pier-sweeping duty.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.227
(<i> sighs</i> )

21:23.490 --> 21:25.742
Wait! Guys, come back!

21:27.035 --> 21:28.412
What is it, Otto?

21:28.495 --> 21:31.581
Lars didn't pull that alarm.
I did.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.000
(<i> both gasp</i> )

21:36.169 --> 21:38.505
And I was there, too.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.633
See?! I told you
I didn't do nothing.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.303
Oh,<i> mijo,</i> we're so sorry.
Can you forgive us?

21:45.387 --> 21:48.432
Okay, all right...
Dad... ooh, get off!

21:50.017 --> 21:53.270
{\an1}That's very honest
of you boys to come forward.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.896
Thanks! Well, I guess

21:54.980 --> 21:56.982
that means we can all go
to the water park.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.650
Not quite.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.780
{\an4}SAM:
And to think I was
just about to close

22:03.864 --> 22:06.158
my investigation
altogether.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.995
Man, Otto, I've never seen
Raymundo so upset before.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.288
I thought his head
was gonna explode.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.957
Yeah, my folks
were pretty mad, too.

22:14.041 --> 22:17.586
Have fun, you guys!

22:17.669 --> 22:19.755
(<i> Lars laughs</i> )

22:19.838 --> 22:23.091
{\an3}Make sure you don't miss any
of those little hairs,<i> losers!</i>

22:23.175 --> 22:25.302
(<i> laughing</i> )

22:27.804 --> 22:29.723
(<i> all laugh</i> )

22:31.641 --> 22:34.770
Don't think I'm not gonna
pound you guys later or nothing,

22:34.853 --> 22:37.314
but, um, like, thanks for
telling the truth and stuff,

22:37.397 --> 22:40.067
'cause if I was you, I would
have not never said nothing!

22:40.150 --> 22:43.195
Chumps! (<i> laughs</i> )

22:44.154 --> 22:47.032
{\an1}Are you sure
we did the right thing?

22:48.116 --> 22:49.159
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.953
<i>Less talk!</i>
<i>More pickup.</i>

22:52.037 --> 22:53.955
<i>We've got a lot</i>
<i>of beach to cover!</i>

22:54.039 --> 22:56.124
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

22:56.958 --> 22:58.585

23:39.835 --> 23:41.545
{\an8}SAM:
In the hay-ouse?
