00:41.240 --> 00:43.834
MAN:
So the paradox is clear.

00:43.870 --> 00:47.101
We defend the Constitution

00:47.140 --> 00:50.246
and the few remaining
protections it provides.

00:50.280 --> 00:52.748
But for our troubles,

00:52.780 --> 00:55.214
we're savaged by the public.

00:55.250 --> 00:59.858
U_nti| one of our detractors
IS charged With a crime.

00:59.890 --> 01:04.350
Then... we become
their best friend.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.199
Their only friend.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.527
Thank you.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.369
Thank you.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.809
Congratulations,
Professor Jenkins.
MAN: Thank you, sir.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.183
(car's security system
beeps twice)

01:47.700 --> 01:49.839
Hello?

01:55.310 --> 01:58.177
_ In addition
to the unique eastern exposure,

01:58.210 --> 01:59.848
this has outstanding flow.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.713
And this living room
is the largest we've seen.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.718
It's 342 square feet.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.718
It's actually the
smallest we've seen.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.387
Uh,' no.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.650
West 83rd was 260 square feet.

02:10.690 --> 02:14.319
No, 360 square feet.
20 by 18.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.295
Well, 98th Street
was definitely smaller.

02:17.330 --> 02:19.696
348 square feet. It also
had eastern exposure.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.389
All right, she has
a memory thing. Don't...

02:21.440 --> 02:24.409
So, uh, let's look
at the plus side.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.759
This is
a recent reno.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.778
They will install
new appliances.

02:27.810 --> 02:29.346
Uh, there's...

02:29.380 --> 02:31.678
minimal street sound.
Oh, and...

02:31.710 --> 02:33.678
have I mentioned,
the former tenant

02:33.720 --> 02:37.941
started her very own successful
cupcake company right here.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.355
Oh. Well,
Oh.
Yeah.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.358
it's a good thing she
was making cupcakes,

02:41.390 --> 02:43.324
'cause you couldn't fit
a whole cake in here.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.526
Why so shy in there?

02:47.560 --> 02:48.891
I was hoping you'd speak up.

02:48.930 --> 02:51.569
You asked me to come along--
I'm gonna give my opinion.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.763
I asked you along because
the brokers think a
couple IS more stable.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.609
Ha! You brought me along
for stability?

02:56.640 --> 02:57.959
That's a first.

02:58.010 --> 02:59.034
Oh.

02:59.070 --> 03:00.970
Besides, your red couch,
there's no way it's gonna

03:01.010 --> 03:03.240
_fi_t in that
IIVIng room.
I hate to tell you,

03:03.280 --> 03:05.874
I got rid of it.
What? The one
from Syracuse?

03:05.910 --> 03:08.219
Why? I liked that couch.
I remember.

03:08.250 --> 03:12.880
It was firm but forgiving,
in all the right places.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.354
You know what?
That couch went to Goodwill

03:15.390 --> 03:16.948
back in March.
When was the last time

03:16.990 --> 03:19.458
you were even at my place,
like, a year ago?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.298
One year, four months,
three days.
Ah, we had a plan

03:22.330 --> 03:24.560
last month-- I was gonna
cook my famous lemon sole,

03:24.600 --> 03:25.828
you were clean out my closets.
Wow,

03:25.870 --> 03:28.737
I wonder why that
plan fell through.

03:28.770 --> 03:30.306
Hey, Murray.

03:32.310 --> 03:35.802
DOA is Christopher Jenkins,
the celebrated defense lawyer.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.944
Do you know him?
From Court TV, yeah.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.813
But also, I testified
against a client of his once.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.738
On cross, Jenkins
tore me a new one.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.679
Yeah, well, you wouldn't be
the first cop he did that to.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.881
He was good.
He somehow stayed a nice guy.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.821
His man lost, but he still
took me out for drinks after,

03:50.860 --> 03:53.021
and he paid.
Jenkins' speech
at the Bar Association

03:53.060 --> 03:55.699
ended around 11:00--
we figure he came down here

03:55.730 --> 03:57.664
to get his car.
The body was discovered

03:57.700 --> 04:00.737
by an attendant arriving
for his 6:00 am. shift.

04:00.770 --> 04:02.499
We found a nine-millimeter
shell casrng under that car.

04:02.540 --> 04:03.939
His wallet's missing.

04:03.970 --> 04:05.164
Looks like the watch
IS gone, too.

04:05.210 --> 04:07.974
AL:
Midtown report any similars
last couple of weeks?

04:08.010 --> 04:10.740
MURRAY:
Two armed robberies in the past
month-- both cases remain open.

04:10.780 --> 04:12.270
AL:
Any wrtnesses?

04:12.320 --> 04:14.709
We're canvassing.
Jay's looking at security video.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.980
Nothing yet.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.885
Hey, Jo.
Hi.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.888
How's the apartment
hunting going?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.922
You know, I never realized
real estate brokers

04:22.960 --> 04:24.780
occasionally just
make things up.

04:24.830 --> 04:25.888
CARRIE:
So, Jo,

04:25.930 --> 04:26.999
what do we got?

04:27.030 --> 04:28.190
Okay,

04:28.230 --> 04:31.859
the bullet entry tear pattern
in the back of the jacket

04:31.900 --> 04:34.039
and the direction of his fall

04:34.070 --> 04:35.890
would indicate that the shooter

04:35.940 --> 04:38.636
was behind him and to his left.
What kind of mugger

04:38.670 --> 04:40.376
shoots his victim from behind?

04:40.410 --> 04:41.968
Here's the thing,
car door's open, right?

04:42.010 --> 04:44.001
Body's over here.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.472
Why?

04:45.510 --> 04:47.068
The perp sneaks up on him...

04:47.120 --> 04:50.487
but Jenkins hears him,
moves back to face him.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.488
No, Jenkins was shot
from behind.

04:52.520 --> 04:55.080
So if he turned
to face the shooter,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.088
he would have had
to turn away agaIn

04:57.130 --> 04:59.325
in order to be shot in the back.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.590
He saw the gun,
and instinctively turned away.

05:01.630 --> 05:03.996
Nah, you never turn away
from a gun in your face.

05:04.030 --> 05:06.021
You ever been mugged?
About the only thing

05:06.070 --> 05:07.469
you can remember is the gun.

05:10.540 --> 05:12.474
He wasn't afraid of being shot.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.831
CARRIE:
He was heading
back to his car.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.576
Jenkins wasn't mugged.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.043
He knew his killer.

05:36.700 --> 05:39.430
...outside the offices of slain
attorney Chris Jenkins.

05:39.470 --> 05:41.563
WOMAN: He gave everything
to his clients.

05:41.600 --> 05:44.398
Days, nights,
weekends.

05:44.440 --> 05:45.737
Professor Jenkins used to say

05:45.770 --> 05:48.739
there wasn't a case he ever lost
he couldn't have won

05:48.780 --> 05:50.771
if he'd just worked
a little harder.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.619
How about when he did lose?

05:52.650 --> 05:53.947
Anyone ever take exception?

05:53.980 --> 05:55.572
If you think
one of his clients did this,

05:55.620 --> 05:58.919
you don't understand what
Professor Jenkins was about.

05:58.950 --> 06:01.418
His clients understood
his dedication.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.688
They adored him for it.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.948
Even the ones who went to jail?
There's obviously

06:04.990 --> 06:08.551
some unhappiness when
a conviction results, but...

06:08.600 --> 06:12.434
I-I can't even imagine it.

06:12.470 --> 06:14.529
And you both saw him last night?

06:14.570 --> 06:16.709
Mark and I work
in Chris's clinic at NYU.

06:16.740 --> 06:19.675
We were both with him
at the Bar Association.

06:19.710 --> 06:23.441
Which one of you saw him last?
Me. After the speech.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.641
I live around here, and Chris
was going to drive me home.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.749
He was gonna get
his car from the lot,

06:26.780 --> 06:27.815
then swing by and pick me up.

06:27.850 --> 06:29.715
When he didn't
show, I just...

06:29.750 --> 06:31.411
figured he forgot.

06:31.450 --> 06:32.712
That's Chris.

06:32.760 --> 06:33.715
He was always
a little...

06:33.760 --> 06:34.886
distracted.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.059
Any particular case
troubling him?

06:39.730 --> 06:41.698
With all due respect,
Detective,

06:41.730 --> 06:44.062
our files are all protected
by confidentiality,

06:44.100 --> 06:45.897
and... without
Signed waivers

06:45.930 --> 06:47.966
we can't turn over anything.
But...

06:48.000 --> 06:50.707
maybe we could give you
a list of clients for now?

06:50.740 --> 06:52.469
Great. That's a start.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.457
WEBSTER: ...tear pattern
in the back of the jacket

07:06.490 --> 07:08.458
and the direction of his fall

07:08.490 --> 07:11.721
would indicate that the shooter
was behind him and to his left.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.456
Did Chris own several pairs

07:14.500 --> 07:15.728
of eyeglasses?

07:15.760 --> 07:18.729
No, just...
the ones he always wore.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.738
The professor hated
spending money

07:20.770 --> 07:22.658
on what he
didn't absolutely need.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.802
Ah.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.537
Got something?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.002
Maybe.

07:31.780 --> 07:34.817
We took a long look at the list
of clients you sent over.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.841
Did you find something
already

07:36.890 --> 07:38.642
Matter of fact, we did.

07:39.690 --> 07:41.749
We found...

07:45.060 --> 07:46.755
his actual case...

07:46.800 --> 07:48.893
was sitting on top of
his desk the whole time.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.795
So then we had to ask
ourselves, well,

07:50.830 --> 07:52.866
whose case
could this be?

07:52.900 --> 07:55.198
And that's when we talked to
the optometrist, whose name...

07:55.240 --> 07:58.562
is stamped.... right there.

07:58.610 --> 08:01.875
You've been going to see
Dr. Ashford since you were 13.

08:01.910 --> 08:03.878
This isn't how it looks.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.548
Really

08:05.580 --> 08:07.070
Maybe we're not seeing

08:07.120 --> 08:08.917
clearly?

08:08.950 --> 08:11.180
Chris really was supposed
to drive me home.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.814
But when he didn't come back,
I got worried.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.727
So I went to look for him
in the garage.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.183
Only...

08:19.230 --> 08:21.221
he was already dead.

08:21.260 --> 08:24.229
Mary Garroto tells us that
you were pretty angry with him

08:24.270 --> 08:25.999
when he passed you over

08:26.030 --> 08:27.861
for that Supreme Court
clerkship you wanted.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.094
I didn't kill him.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.233
Then why lie about being there?

08:31.270 --> 08:33.773
Because I took a file
out of his briefcase.

08:33.810 --> 08:36.074
A file?
Why would you do that?

08:36.110 --> 08:37.577
To protect him.

08:37.610 --> 08:38.941
What he stood for.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.141
Last year he
won a verdict

08:41.180 --> 08:44.308
in this horrible murder,
a teenage girl.

08:44.350 --> 08:45.840
_The client was
Innocent, only...

08:45.890 --> 08:48.609
her father wouldn't accept
the jury's verdict.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.959
Afterward, he sued
Chris for defamation.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.958
The trial was coming up.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.956
Our entire strategy
was in that file.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.719
I knew if it became
part of a crIme scene,

08:58.770 --> 08:59.839
it would go public.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.805
So you just took it?
I guess I panicked.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.604
You know what I guess?
I guess you're gonna
need a good lawyer.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.301
I know I did something stupid,

09:07.340 --> 09:10.173
but you guys should talk
to that girl's father, Simkins.

09:10.210 --> 09:12.201
He really hated Chris.

09:14.650 --> 09:15.969
MAN:
All I wanted was justice.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.317
This Jenkins, I mean,

09:17.350 --> 09:19.818
all those big lawyers,
I don't see how they

09:19.860 --> 09:21.851
look themselves in the mirror.
Mr. Simkins,

09:21.890 --> 09:24.688
I examined the case
very closely.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.789
Jenkins' client
had a strong alibi.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.923
In fact, it's my understanding
you're the one who pushed

09:28.960 --> 09:30.791
the DA. to go forward
with the trial.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.639
Sir... I can only imagine

09:32.670 --> 09:34.638
how hard it was
to lose your daughter.

09:34.670 --> 09:35.967
What do you people want?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.831
Where were you last night?

09:37.870 --> 09:40.077
What, do you think
I killed this piece of crap?

09:40.110 --> 09:41.998
Did you?

09:42.040 --> 09:43.769
You know, my old
man used to say,

09:46.150 --> 09:47.811
I'm not gonna mourn him,

09:47.850 --> 09:49.112
but you don't sue somebody
you're gonna kill.

09:49.150 --> 09:51.015
I wanted him to live
with what he did.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.086
In fact, I told him that
last time I saw him.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.257
And when was that?

09:54.290 --> 09:56.656
At his deposition, two days ago.

09:56.690 --> 09:58.954
'Course, Jenkins pulled a fast
one, acting all friendly

09:58.990 --> 10:00.855
and cooperative,
and then he gets this call,

10:00.900 --> 10:02.993
some emergency, he said,
and took off.

10:03.030 --> 10:04.895
Probably another scumbag
he had to save.

10:04.930 --> 10:06.898
Mr. Simkins,
can you answer the question?

10:06.940 --> 10:08.828
Where were you last night?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.008
I was at an AA meeting.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.235
MURRAY:
I talked to a Father Kerrigan.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.249
Simkins was at an AA meeting,
just like he said.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.942
You don't get a better
alibi than a priest.
Yeah.

10:19.980 --> 10:21.971
Hey, guys, check this out.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.908
I just got back Jenkins'
cell phone records.

10:23.950 --> 10:25.178
Now, there were no phone calls

10:25.220 --> 10:26.778
aft_er_ the
Bar Assocratlon speech,

10:26.820 --> 10:28.310
but I tracked down
the emergency call

10:28.360 --> 10:31.227
Simkins said he got a couple
days ago at that deposition.

10:31.260 --> 10:32.955
Turns out it originated

10:33.000 --> 10:35.958
from a pay phone
in an East Harlem bodega.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.195
Pay phone?
Who uses a pay phone anymore?

10:38.230 --> 10:40.391
Well, this guy does, huh?

10:40.440 --> 10:44.228
Security camera picked it up
from across the street.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.330
_ With _our
facral recognition sobeare,

10:47.380 --> 10:48.733
maybe we put a name to the face.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.972
Hang on.

11:03.990 --> 11:06.049
That's Shawn Manning.

11:06.090 --> 11:08.149
Wait a minute.
The Shawn Manning?
Yeah.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.997
Why? Is this guy famous
or something?

11:10.030 --> 11:10.962
More like infamous.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.965
"The Millennial Monster."

11:16.000 --> 11:18.036
"Central Park
Cyclist Rape."

11:18.070 --> 11:21.039
Summer 2000.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.241
Right.
I was in DC. back then.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.440
I don't remember
the details.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.778
Shawn Manning attacked
a medical student

11:26.820 --> 11:27.969
riding her bike
through the Park at night.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.409
She was in critical for weeks,
couldn't remember anything

11:30.450 --> 11:31.883
about the attack.
We are talking

11:31.920 --> 11:33.456
a beautiful
young doctor,

11:33.490 --> 11:35.151
Giuliani's "New" New York...
The city went nuts,

11:35.190 --> 11:36.418
vigilante style.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.781
I was here a few months
later for a wedding.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.427
The city was still pretty tense.
JAY: Whoa, hold on, guys.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.791
Take a look at this.

11:45.970 --> 11:47.164
Jenkins was
Shawn Manning's lavwer.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.394
Except Jenkins lost that one.

11:48.440 --> 11:49.759
Kid was tried as an adult,

11:49.810 --> 11:51.266
got 12 and
a half to 25.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.107
So what's he doing on
a pay phone in East Harlem?

11:53.140 --> 11:55.438
Calling his old
lawyer, maybe?

11:55.480 --> 11:57.801
Shawn Manning just got paroled
two weeks ago.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.078
I guess they did it
pretty quietly.

12:00.350 --> 12:03.808
This is him now,
just before his release.

12:06.790 --> 12:08.314
AL:
All right, thanks.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.021
So, according
to his students,

12:10.060 --> 12:12.528
Jenkins hadn't been in touch
with Shawn Manning for years.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.255
At first, he would
call from prison

12:14.300 --> 12:15.949
with leads to finding
the real rapist,

12:16.000 --> 12:18.093
but eventually,
he gave up.

12:18.130 --> 12:20.337
He gave up,
or his lavwer gave up?

12:20.370 --> 12:23.032
No, sounds like Jenkins
stayed on it for a while.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.061
Manning just
stopped calling.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.968
By the way,

12:29.010 --> 12:31.205
smart not mentioning
we came down here together.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.013
To my cousin's wedding.

12:33.050 --> 12:35.541
That was
a memorable weekend.
Mm.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.309
You mean the giant
cockroach under the bed

12:37.350 --> 12:38.840
in our fancy hotel?

12:38.890 --> 12:39.982
I remember that.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.317
Really?

12:41.360 --> 12:43.783
Is that all
you remember?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.792
Shawn's my sister's son.

12:51.830 --> 12:54.094
She passed while
he was in prison.

12:54.140 --> 12:54.765
Dad's never been
In the picture.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.732
He's been living
here with me

12:55.770 --> 12:58.261
since his release,
keeping his nose clean.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.329
Soon as I saw that
man was murdered,

13:01.380 --> 13:02.870
I knew you'd come.

13:02.910 --> 13:03.979
Why's that?

13:04.010 --> 13:08.140
He didn't do what
they say he did.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.909
But I don't care anymore.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.281
What matters
is that Shawn

13:11.320 --> 13:12.912
served his time.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.382
And he deserves
a second chance

13:14.420 --> 13:15.352
like anybody else.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.585
AL:
Do you know where
Shawn was last night?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.052
He was with me.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.354
Came in around... 9:00.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.890
Was here all night.

13:22.930 --> 13:24.329
So you can forget what
it is you're thinking.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.258
Jenkins did all
he could for Shawn.

13:26.300 --> 13:28.393
He's got no ill will
for the man.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.408
Any idea where
we can find him?

13:30.440 --> 13:32.260
No.

13:32.310 --> 13:33.800
It's Rhonda, right?

13:35.040 --> 13:36.371
Carrie.

13:36.410 --> 13:38.105
I, uh...

13:38.150 --> 13:39.401
I just wanted to know...

13:39.450 --> 13:41.441
was Shawn in touch
with Chris Jenkins at all?

13:41.480 --> 13:43.516
Not that I know.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.279
But I told Shawn that

13:45.320 --> 13:47.413
no matter how badly
he was wronged,

13:47.460 --> 13:49.257
he needed to move forward,

13:49.290 --> 13:51.281
leave the past
where it belongs.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.321
He's got a room here
only so long as

13:53.360 --> 13:54.850
he's out finding
himself a job.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.165
Rhonda, would you mind
showing me Shawn's room?

14:04.410 --> 14:06.002
Thank you.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.406
It's not much,
but he's...

14:08.440 --> 14:10.442
he's grateful.

14:17.450 --> 14:19.918
Fast food places
have jobs,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.211
but nobody's jumping
up and down

14:21.260 --> 14:23.080
to hire a convicted rapist.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.428
Rhonda,
do Shawn a favor.

14:25.460 --> 14:26.552
Have him call us.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.558
No one want to see
him get hurt.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.422
I have to disagree
with you, Carrie.

14:32.470 --> 14:33.892
That's all they want.

14:33.940 --> 14:36.238
AL:
Get a car

14:36.270 --> 14:38.135
out front here and
I'll get Jay started

14:38.170 --> 14:39.501
on a subpoena
for the phones.

14:39.540 --> 14:41.474
Huh. My friendly
real estate agent.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.608
Hey, Paula.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.278
Yeah?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.345
Block off the Park,
below market?

14:49.380 --> 14:52.042
Really?
Sounds good.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.081
We will come by
and take a look

14:54.120 --> 14:55.656
as soon as we can.

14:55.690 --> 14:56.588
Great.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.919
Yeah, maybe you should
go to this one alone.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.019
What? You know what
you're lookIng for anyway.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.664
You don't need me.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.998
It's the whole Manhattan
thing, Isn't It?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.930
Why would I care
if you move to Manhattan?

15:07.970 --> 15:09.289
I don't know.
Why would you?

15:09.340 --> 15:10.409
I don't.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.930
Listen, if you
want to move on up

15:11.970 --> 15:13.403
and pay a fortune to live
in some hole in the wall

15:13.440 --> 15:16.329
in the one-oh-ohs,
it's fine by me.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.507
The one-ones will get along
just groovy without you.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.074
Okay.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.213
Number one: my identity's
not tied to a zip code.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.478
Number two:
we work there.

15:23.520 --> 15:27.058
You ever think maybe
it's about convenience?

15:32.590 --> 15:35.297
Al...

15:35.330 --> 15:38.197
that gate was latched before.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.088
Shawn!
Police!

16:44.570 --> 16:46.162
REPORTER:
CBSZ News has learned that

16:46.200 --> 16:48.430
Shawn Manning,
convicted 13 years ago

16:48.470 --> 16:50.609
in the Central Park
cyclist case,

16:50.640 --> 16:52.301
is now a person of interest

16:52.340 --> 16:53.568
in the murder
of his former lawyer,

16:53.610 --> 16:54.577
Christopher Jenkins.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.737
Manning's original victim,

16:56.780 --> 17:00.443
Dr. Rupa Nair, refused comment.

17:00.480 --> 17:01.549
Dr. Nair

17:01.580 --> 17:04.048
Do you feel safe with
Shawn Manning on the loose?

17:04.090 --> 17:05.318
I have nothing to say. Please.

17:05.350 --> 17:06.487
Dr. Nair?

17:08.860 --> 17:10.384
You do realize
that certain individuals

17:10.430 --> 17:13.251
with a good deal of forethought
went to a lot of trouble

17:13.300 --> 17:15.450
to keep the Shawn Manning parole
as quiet as possible.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.297
Best laid plans, right?

17:17.330 --> 17:19.127
It's a media firestorm
out there.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.364
Well, don't look at us.

17:20.400 --> 17:21.389
Anybody could have been
the source of that.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.169
Yeah, well, now that it's out,

17:23.210 --> 17:25.360
we better find Manning
sooner rather than later.

17:25.410 --> 17:26.434
Otherwise,
the optics could kill us.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.404
A murder suspect
is running loose.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.340
A rape victim is being harassed
by the media.

17:30.380 --> 17:31.699
You're worried about optics?

17:31.750 --> 17:34.742
When I said they could kill,
I was including Manning.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.714
You weren't here
when the rape went down.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.308
The city went crazy.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.614
I've never seen anything like it
before or since.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.480
We had mobs in the street

17:42.520 --> 17:43.555
looking for this guy.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.683
Luckily, we found Manning first,

17:45.730 --> 17:48.528
which is exactly what I expect
to happen this time.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.367
They're staking out
Shawn's aunt's house,

17:51.400 --> 17:52.697
but there's no way
he's coming back.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.391
He's got no money, and,

17:54.440 --> 17:56.567
like, a thousand people looking
for him. Where's he gonna go?

17:56.600 --> 17:58.830
He's smart. He'll find
somewhere to hide.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.406
Maybe somebody's
been helping him.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.668
I'm gonna look at
the aunt's phone.

18:01.710 --> 18:02.870
But check this.

18:02.910 --> 18:04.377
Ran Jenkins' credit activity.

18:04.410 --> 18:05.843
The guy's a creature of habit.

18:05.880 --> 18:07.677
Does lunch just about every day

18:07.720 --> 18:10.245
from the same falafel truck
over on 63rd and Lex.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.382
Funny thing is,

18:11.420 --> 18:12.546
the day before
the murder,

18:12.590 --> 18:14.478
there's a charge
at a pizza place over

18:14.520 --> 18:17.182
on East 103rd Street.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.858
Gino's Homestyle.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.859
103rd? That's a ways from home.

18:25.300 --> 18:28.861
RHONDA:
Fast food places have jobs, but
nobody's jumping up and down

18:28.900 --> 18:30.731
to hire a convicted rapist.

18:30.770 --> 18:34.274
Shawn had a Gino's menu
in his bedroom.

18:34.310 --> 18:37.177
Pizza place isn't far from where
he made the pay phone call.

18:37.210 --> 18:39.872
Sorry, I don't know either guy,
I'm telling you.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.448
Two days ago, quarter to
three in the afternoon,

18:43.490 --> 18:45.412
$12.75 on food
and drink?

18:45.450 --> 18:46.485
Hey, a lot of people
come and go here.

18:46.520 --> 18:47.817
Yeah, I bet

18:47.860 --> 18:50.283
you get a big
suit-and-tie
crowd in here.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.355
Your employees always
dress like that?

18:54.530 --> 18:56.589
Why? What are you,
the health inspector here?

18:56.630 --> 18:59.690
Section 81.13.

18:59.730 --> 19:01.459
"Food workers shall wear hats,

19:01.500 --> 19:02.831
"caps, hairnets, or

19:02.870 --> 19:05.168
"other hair coverings to
effectively keep hair

19:05.210 --> 19:06.837
"from having contact
with exposed food

19:06.870 --> 19:07.939
or food contact
surfaces."

19:07.980 --> 19:11.302
Take another look.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.238
Okay, fine.

19:13.280 --> 19:15.714
I saw on the news
about this guy getting whacked.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.947
I figured keeping my mouth shut
would be in my best interest.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.458
But now I see
how important

19:21.490 --> 19:22.957
you consider my cooperation.

19:22.990 --> 19:24.958
Yeah, I saw him.

19:24.990 --> 19:26.787
He was here like you said.

19:26.830 --> 19:29.526
Was he with him?

19:29.560 --> 19:30.492
Yeah.

19:30.530 --> 19:32.225
Shawn Manning.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.589
Come in here a lot?

19:33.640 --> 19:36.234
Just that one time.
Did he ask
about a job?

19:36.270 --> 19:38.329
Job? No, he came here,
he wanted to eat something.

19:38.370 --> 19:40.201
That rapist guy, huh?

19:40.240 --> 19:41.537
He's an animal.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.571
If you see him,

19:43.610 --> 19:45.805
or you remember anything
else, you call me.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.841
And buy some hairnets.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.768
Section 81?

19:49.820 --> 19:51.378
How'd you know that?

19:51.420 --> 19:52.614
I made it up.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.550
You're learning.

19:58.390 --> 20:00.255
Hey, you bring me
back a slice?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.597
You don't want a slice, Jay.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.359
Not from Gino's,
believe me.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.492
What do you got?

20:04.530 --> 20:06.327
Shawn Manning's
aunt's phone records.

20:06.370 --> 20:07.598
It shows at least
a dozen calls

20:07.640 --> 20:08.868
to your new favorite
pizza joint.

20:08.900 --> 20:09.992
That's funny.

20:10.040 --> 20:11.507
Gino never mentioned that.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.962
And he said Manning wasn't
looking for a job.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.671
Either way,
that is a lot of calls

20:14.710 --> 20:16.371
just to bug someone to hire you,

20:16.410 --> 20:18.605
which is why I also checked
Gino's phone line, too.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.675
To see if anyone
called Manning back.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.574
I'm thinking,
if it's not about a job,

20:22.620 --> 20:24.815
maybe we find the person
who's helping him hide out.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.545
And did you?
No.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.478
In fact, nobody
called Manning back.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.885
It turns out,

20:29.920 --> 20:32.627
each time he called,
someone at Gino's

20:32.660 --> 20:35.697
turned right around and called
the cell phone of this guy--

20:35.730 --> 20:38.563
Robert Cordero.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.364
And today, two minutes
after you and Al left Gino's,

20:41.400 --> 20:42.765
there was another call placed
to Cordero.

20:42.800 --> 20:43.937
So who's Robert Cordero?

20:43.970 --> 20:45.301
Not sure.

20:45.340 --> 20:46.466
But he has a heck
of a long sheet.

20:46.510 --> 20:47.579
Looks like
we're looking at

20:47.610 --> 20:49.908
mostly street
robberies, burglaries

20:49.940 --> 20:52.272
and sexual assaults.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.810
What kind of sexual assault?

20:54.850 --> 20:56.010
Like, what was his M.O.?

20:56.050 --> 20:57.608
Let's see.

20:57.650 --> 20:59.845
Okay, so,

20:59.890 --> 21:02.381
he likes to pick off single
woman in their 205,

21:02.420 --> 21:04.285
early evenings, on
bridges and in parks.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.854
He attacked a woman
while jogging,

21:05.890 --> 21:07.994
and three others while
riding their bikes.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.827
Mm, like
the Central Park victim.

21:09.860 --> 21:10.963
Jay, the entire time

21:11.000 --> 21:12.399
he was in prison,

21:12.430 --> 21:14.489
Manning was trying
to clear his name, right?

21:14.540 --> 21:15.734
So what if he found Cordero

21:15.770 --> 21:17.738
and convinced Jenkins
he was onto something?

21:17.770 --> 21:19.601
Jenkins is leaning on him,

21:19.640 --> 21:21.631
Cordero's got a motive
to back him off.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.568
Yeah, with a bullet.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.017
Gino's my cousin.

21:28.050 --> 21:29.711
So what if he called me?

21:29.750 --> 21:30.910
You know what I think?

21:30.950 --> 21:33.418
I think this lavwer, Jenkins,
was asking around about you,

21:33.460 --> 21:35.587
and your cousin Gino
gave you the heads up.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.326
Heads up about what?

21:37.360 --> 21:38.622
Well, gee, let's see,
Mr. Cordero.

21:38.660 --> 21:39.752
You're a two-time loser
for rape.

21:39.790 --> 21:42.657
Maybe Jenkins was
asking around about

21:42.700 --> 21:43.519
that old Central Park case.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.720
That happened, like,
a hundred years ago,

21:45.770 --> 21:47.658
and they caught the guy.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.634
You know what?

21:49.670 --> 21:52.639
The next time you come and
see me, you bring a lawyer.

21:52.670 --> 21:54.331
I know my rights.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.631
And you got to give
me one for free.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.739
How about I bring
Christopher Jenkins?

21:57.780 --> 22:00.510
Oh, wait. He's dead.

22:00.550 --> 22:02.711
Stay the hell away from me.

22:06.690 --> 22:08.351
Hey, Dr. Nair.

22:08.390 --> 22:09.709
Hi, June. How's Jordan doing?

22:09.760 --> 22:10.727
Great.
Thanks so much.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.664
Dr. Nair.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.808
No, no! No, please, get away!

22:28.840 --> 22:29.807
Please, get away!

22:29.840 --> 22:31.068
Get away!

22:31.110 --> 22:33.442
Please, get away!

22:34.480 --> 22:35.845
No, no.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.655
WOMAN:
Yes, do you have any other...?

22:45.690 --> 22:48.625
RUPA:
When I realized who it was,
I tried to run,

22:48.660 --> 22:51.424
but I pretty much just planted
my face in the street

22:51.470 --> 22:52.528
and not very gracefully.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.765
Well, it's hard to be graceful

22:54.800 --> 22:56.461
when you're running
for your life.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.468
I'll try to look at it that way.

22:58.510 --> 23:02.606
Did Shawn Manning attack you?

23:02.640 --> 23:05.108
When I saw his eyes,
it was like a blow.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.940
There I was on the street,
completely vulnerable.

23:09.980 --> 23:11.686
So I suppose not.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.450
I feel like
an idiot.

23:14.490 --> 23:18.620
All this attention for a scraped
elbow and a bruised eyebrow.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.525
I think you're very brave.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.597
Just hardheaded.

23:23.630 --> 23:25.598
Psychopath gets out
on parole,

23:25.630 --> 23:27.598
murders his lawyer,
goes after his old victim,

23:27.640 --> 23:28.789
and we still can't
collar him up?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.933
Did I get any part
of that wrong, Eliot?

23:30.970 --> 23:32.733
Because you can stop me
if I did.

23:32.770 --> 23:34.909
No, that's pretty much it,
Gordon.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.703
I, and a number of people
I know, who you know,

23:36.740 --> 23:39.573
have been working very hard
to polish this city's image!

23:39.610 --> 23:43.580
This is a crime-free global
go-to destination town.

23:43.620 --> 23:46.418
And I won't have some madman
screwmg that up.

23:47.890 --> 23:49.710
Get him off the street.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.523
Whatever it takes.

23:57.630 --> 23:59.461
Gordon Frost-- if things
go right for him,

23:59.500 --> 24:01.058
he's gonna be
the next D .A.

24:01.100 --> 24:03.603
Well, somebody eat
his birthday cake?

24:03.640 --> 24:05.130
Except he's right.
If we can't bring in Manning,

24:05.170 --> 24:06.706
they'll just find someone else
who can.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.934
Based on what?

24:07.980 --> 24:09.675
There's not one piece
of physical evidence

24:09.710 --> 24:11.041
that ties Shawn Manning
to Jenkins' murder.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.071
Don't start, Carrie.

24:13.110 --> 24:14.839
He didn't attack Rupa tonight.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.142
Then what was he doing there?

24:16.180 --> 24:19.718
I think he was looking
for her help.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.083
You... you think he was looking
for her help?

24:23.120 --> 24:25.156
Yes, I think he wanted to see

24:25.190 --> 24:27.852
if she could identify
the man who really attacked her.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.253
According to the law,

24:29.300 --> 24:30.665
he's already
been identified.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.622
What if the law's wrong?

24:32.670 --> 24:37.061
What if Shawn Manning
did not rape Rupa Nair?

24:37.100 --> 24:39.705
No, no, I am not going
down that road.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.230
Shawn Manning confessed.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.544
He was convicted
by a jury of his peers.

24:43.580 --> 24:46.743
All I need you to do
is find Manning, understand?

24:46.780 --> 24:49.613
Leave the rest to me,
okay, Detective?

24:51.590 --> 24:54.559
You really think he's innocent.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.012
Yeah, and I think you need

24:56.060 --> 24:57.857
to take a harder look
at Cordero.

24:57.890 --> 25:00.688
If not for the rape,
at least for Jenkins' murder.

25:00.730 --> 25:01.992
Look, Cordero transferred
through Dannemora prison

25:02.030 --> 25:03.156
when Shawn was there.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.622
Maybe that's when
Shawn got onto him.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.833
Okay, hypothetically,
but hypothetically only,

25:07.870 --> 25:10.236
in order for Cordero to
have a motive to kill Jenkins,

25:10.270 --> 25:11.862
he has to be the real rapist.

25:11.910 --> 25:13.309
Otherwise, he'd have nothing
to fear, right?

25:13.340 --> 25:14.329
Agreed.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.837
Okay. To make a case
against Cordero for the rape,

25:16.880 --> 25:19.201
we'd have to put him
in the Park at the time.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.274
Also agreed.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.039
Except there's no indication
he was in the Park.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.684
There's not a single witness.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.688
You've been looking into Cordero
yourself, haven't you?

25:25.720 --> 25:27.654
Of course I've been
looking into Cordero.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.749
I got Murray out there
tracking him right now.

25:29.790 --> 25:30.984
But there's no there
there, Carrie.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.625
There's not a single database
where his name ever comes up up.

25:34.660 --> 25:37.561
You're forgetting
the one database

25:37.600 --> 25:38.862
we haven't tapped into.

25:38.900 --> 25:42.233
I've got a roomful
of anxious parents

25:42.270 --> 25:43.294
and sick children,

25:43.340 --> 25:45.331
_ so ten minutes
is all I can spare.

25:45.370 --> 25:47.304
Well, I will talk
quickly, then.

25:47.340 --> 25:48.978
Quickly or slowly, I don't know

25:49.010 --> 25:51.046
what more I can tell you
about last night.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.843
I'm not here about last night,
Rupa.

25:52.880 --> 25:56.748
I'm here about what happened
to you in the Park.

25:56.780 --> 26:02.218
You'll forgive me if I'm
severely sick of that subject.

26:02.260 --> 26:04.626
If that's all you want
to talk about,

26:04.660 --> 26:06.218
I'm _afraid _
our ten minutes is up.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.854
It's not that I want to talk
about it,

26:08.900 --> 26:10.868
it's that I have to talk
about it

26:10.900 --> 26:12.299
because of Shawn Manning.

26:12.330 --> 26:13.638
Have you caught him yet?

26:13.670 --> 26:14.739
No.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.590
Well, why don't you go do that?

26:16.640 --> 26:18.130
Lock him up and throw away
the key.

26:18.170 --> 26:19.899
Please,

26:19.940 --> 26:22.238
just for a minute.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.838
Thank you.

26:25.210 --> 26:28.748
I think Shawn is innocent.

26:28.780 --> 26:31.283
What do you mean, "innocent"?

26:31.320 --> 26:34.687
The man was tried and
conVIcted, he went to prison.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.686
Do you recognize this man?

26:39.730 --> 26:41.789
Why, who is he?

26:41.830 --> 26:43.764
His name is Bobby Cordero.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.199
I think he's the man
who attacked you

26:45.230 --> 26:46.322
in the Park that night.

26:46.370 --> 26:50.761
Please... please.

26:52.310 --> 26:54.676
Sorry, never saw him before.

26:54.710 --> 26:55.699
Are you sure?

26:55.740 --> 26:57.879
Detective, I have said,

26:57.910 --> 27:01.311
I don't remember
anything from that day.

27:01.350 --> 27:04.683
Do you understand
what "anything" means?

27:04.720 --> 27:06.608
I do.

27:07.450 --> 27:10.851
And yet it dominates my life.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.357
Isn't it strange?

27:12.390 --> 27:14.392
A past I can't remember.

27:16.430 --> 27:20.696
When I was a eight years old,
my sister was murdered.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.833
I found her body.

27:24.010 --> 27:28.800
For years I-I couldn't,
I couldn't remember anything,

27:28.840 --> 27:30.842
and,uh".

27:33.310 --> 27:35.278
...then, then
it started coming back to me,

27:35.320 --> 27:37.276
you know, bits
and pieces of the truth.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.381
The truth is, I was raped,

27:41.420 --> 27:44.218
a man went to prison,
and here I am.

27:44.260 --> 27:46.683
What does the
past matter?

27:46.730 --> 27:49.927
We both know
why it matters.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.692
Anything at all...

27:52.730 --> 27:55.961
For me it was,
um, fragments,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.867
you know,
just li-like a silhouette

27:58.910 --> 28:00.309
where a face should
have been and, and,

28:00.340 --> 28:04.902
um, leaves, branches,
trees, things like that.

28:06.950 --> 28:09.271
I haven't had
anything like that.

28:09.320 --> 28:10.947
I'm sorry.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.818
No, I'm sorry.

28:13.860 --> 28:18.923
You've been very gracious
and my ten minutes is up.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.757
Thank you.

28:22.800 --> 28:25.894
But, you know,
there is something.

28:25.930 --> 28:28.239
In the middle of the night

28:28.270 --> 28:31.398
when my mind won't rest,

28:31.440 --> 28:33.908
something I
hear-- a sound.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.407
What sound?

28:35.440 --> 28:38.341
A tapping sound...

28:38.380 --> 28:41.076
almost like metal, clicking.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.816
I play piano,
and at first

28:43.850 --> 28:46.978
I assumed it was a metronome.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.521
But the sound is deeper,
more irregular.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.051
I can't place it.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.898
That's all.

28:56.930 --> 28:58.864
Perhaps it will help?

28:58.900 --> 29:00.834
Perhaps it will.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.432
Well, you tried.

29:06.470 --> 29:10.338
I thought maybe I could
get her to remember more.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.803
I've been going through
the original case file,

29:12.850 --> 29:14.272
see if something
jumps out.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.278
Beyond Shawn's confession
and his shalq alibi,

29:17.320 --> 29:19.140
they really didn't
have much on him.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.543
DNA was inconclusive.

29:23.490 --> 29:24.923
Do you know what
an idiot I was?

29:24.960 --> 29:25.927
When we were here

29:25.960 --> 29:27.052
for that wedding,

29:27.090 --> 29:29.524
I went into the Park
on my own at night.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.492
Oh, you're telling me.

29:30.530 --> 29:32.896
I remember you insisted
on going for a jog

29:32.930 --> 29:34.238
after the rehearsal dinner.

29:34.270 --> 29:35.965
It was like 11:00.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.230
Yeah, well, I thought
I was a tough Syracuse cop.

29:38.270 --> 29:41.171
I can go jogging ifI want to.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.949
I got a little freaked out.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.468
You
ok
ay, ma'am?

30:08.500 --> 30:11.367
A horse.

30:12.570 --> 30:14.470
A horse-- listen,
Rupa said she heard

30:14.510 --> 30:16.978
a metallic tapping sound
like a metronome,

30:17.010 --> 30:18.204
but she couldn't remember
what it was.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.605
When I was jogging in the Park
that night,

30:20.650 --> 30:22.538
I heard the same sound,
it scared me,

30:22.580 --> 30:25.913
I turned around,
it was a mounted cop.

30:25.950 --> 30:27.542
But I've been through
all the files.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.956
There's no mention
of any mounted cops.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.184
They've got to keep
some kind of roster

30:31.230 --> 30:33.380
of who was on duty
that night, right?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.354
She was lying
just off the road.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.960
I was the first one
to find her.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.968
I stayed until
the paramedics arrived,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.638
then I took off
to canvass the area,

30:43.670 --> 30:44.898
look for suspects
and witnesses.

30:44.940 --> 30:46.066
What'd you find?

30:46.110 --> 30:47.600
No one saw anything.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.904
And you didn't see
anyone suspicious?

30:49.940 --> 30:52.101
Look, it was a long time ago.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.243
I know, but anything
you can remember...

30:55.520 --> 30:58.444
Whatever I saw is in
my DD-5 report from that night.

30:59.490 --> 31:03.381
There is no DD-5
in the D.A.'s file.

31:03.420 --> 31:04.956
What?

31:04.990 --> 31:06.526
What did you see, Karen?

31:08.560 --> 31:11.199
There was this one guy
about a hundred yards away.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.395
He just looked
wrong, you know,

31:14.440 --> 31:17.000
sweaty,
out of breath.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.530
I took his name
and address.

31:18.570 --> 31:20.060
You remember his name?

31:20.110 --> 31:22.237
No, but I remember
he had priors.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.147
What are you
talking about?

31:25.180 --> 31:27.398
It has to be in the file.

31:27.450 --> 31:31.079
I even remember talking to my
C.O. right before the trial,

31:31.120 --> 31:34.009
and he told me that the D.A.s
on the case looked into it

31:34.060 --> 31:35.516
but that they already had
a confession.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.218
That's him.

31:46.270 --> 31:47.999
There.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.974
Murray, I need you
to pick up Cordero.

31:54.010 --> 31:55.705
That won't be possible.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.970
He's already being picked up.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.311
Hey, guys, Jo's
just finishing up.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.555
Hey.
WEBSTER:
I'll say this:

32:13.590 --> 32:16.252
repetition doesn't make
my heart grow fonder.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.962
We're looking at nine-millimeter
slugs, hollow-point—-

32:19.000 --> 32:22.094
the same type of round
that killed Chris Jenkins.

32:22.140 --> 32:23.437
Got a time of death?

32:23.470 --> 32:24.732
10:00, 10:30 last night.

32:24.770 --> 32:26.362
Plenty of time
for Manning to get here

32:26.410 --> 32:27.729
after he went to Rupa Nair.

32:27.770 --> 32:29.135
I don't believe that, Al,

32:29.180 --> 32:30.977
and I don't think
you believe it either.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.102
First he killed the lavwer

32:32.150 --> 32:34.118
who blew the case, then
the man he held responsible

32:34.150 --> 32:36.141
for the crime.

32:36.180 --> 32:38.410
I'm putting out a tactical
alert for Manning.
Al.

32:39.350 --> 32:42.217
Wait one second, okay?

32:51.570 --> 32:53.367
Get him off the street.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.664
Whatever it takes.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.504
MAN:
Yeah. We keep

32:59.540 --> 33:01.371
a record of every car we park.

33:01.410 --> 33:03.731
Make, model, plate.
Great. You have last night's?

33:03.780 --> 33:06.374
Knock yourself out.

33:06.410 --> 33:08.344
Thank you very much.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.746
All right, you want to tell me
what the hell you're doing?

33:10.780 --> 33:12.680
ADA Frost parked
his car in this lot.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.052
I saw the ticket stub
on his windshield.

33:15.090 --> 33:17.058
892.
Frost?

33:17.090 --> 33:19.422
Yep. And look at this.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.519
The receipt is
stamped-- last night

33:21.560 --> 33:23.551
right before Cordero was shot.

33:23.600 --> 33:27.058
Carrie, Frost is gonna be
the next Manhattan D.A.

33:27.100 --> 33:29.739
Yeah, I wouldn't bank on that.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.775
We can place Gordon Frost
at Cordero's murder.

33:38.810 --> 33:41.370
Gordon Frost? He's the head
of the Homicide Bureau--

33:41.420 --> 33:44.082
he goes to murder scenes
all the time.
Really?

33:44.120 --> 33:45.280
Before they're committed?

33:45.320 --> 33:47.538
Okay...

33:47.590 --> 33:49.251
what are you two
talking about?

33:49.290 --> 33:51.053
And I say that with
some reluctance.

33:51.090 --> 33:52.682
Frost parked his car
at Molinero's

33:52.730 --> 33:55.597
ten minutes before Bobby Cordero
was killed there.

33:55.630 --> 33:59.191
Sometimes my therapist says,
"Begin at the beginning,"

33:59.230 --> 34:00.561
and, oh, I want
to kill him

34:00.600 --> 34:03.262
when he says it, but I think
I'm gonna say that now.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.165
We think Manning
and Jenkins made Cordero

34:05.210 --> 34:06.700
for the Central Park rape.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.277
We think Jenkins then took it
to Gordon Frost.

34:09.310 --> 34:11.505
Okay, but, then,
how do we get to Gordon Frost

34:11.550 --> 34:12.801
killing someone
he's never heard of?

34:12.850 --> 34:14.272
Because he had heard of him.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.470
Listen, we got a report
from a mounted cop

34:16.520 --> 34:18.317
that can place Cordero
in Central Park

34:18.350 --> 34:21.285
the night of the rape--
only that report never made it

34:21.320 --> 34:22.548
into the D.A.'s file.

34:22.590 --> 34:24.387
AL: Gordon Frost
was in charge

34:24.430 --> 34:25.556
of coordinating the evidence.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.228
He had the confession
from Manning,

34:27.260 --> 34:30.149
but he also had DNA from the
scene that did not match his.

34:30.200 --> 34:33.499
The last thing he wanted was
to open it up to other suspects.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.293
So he suppresses the evidence.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.160
Listen, Frost
figures out

34:37.200 --> 34:39.259
that Jenkins is onto Cordero.

34:39.310 --> 34:42.131
He knows that eventually that
cop's report is gonna surface,

34:42.180 --> 34:43.636
and then he can kiss
his D.A. career good-bye.

34:43.680 --> 34:45.409
So he kills Jenkins

34:45.450 --> 34:48.510
and then Cordero
to cover his tracks.

34:48.550 --> 34:51.110
I can't believe
I just said that.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.510
Who else knows about this?

34:55.560 --> 34:57.255
Just you and us.

34:57.290 --> 34:59.224
Good. Keep it that way.
What?

34:59.260 --> 35:01.251
If word gets out that
we're looking at Frost,
right or wrong...

35:01.300 --> 35:03.723
Eliot, we can't just
close our eyes and make believe

35:03.760 --> 35:05.227
this didn't happen.
Shawn Manning's

35:05.270 --> 35:08.364
life is on the line here.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.630
Look, this city is going
through a rather painful case

35:10.670 --> 35:12.206
of dj vu right now.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.434
Before I make
that worse,

35:13.470 --> 35:15.233
we need to get Manning
off the streets.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.374
Then we go
after Frost.
Wait a second.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.605
LISA:
"I will put my spirit on him,

35:20.650 --> 35:23.278
and he will proclaim justice
to the nations."

35:27.320 --> 35:29.288
RHONDA:
Shawn's my sister's son.

35:29.320 --> 35:31.185
She passed
while he was in prison.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.186
Dad's never been
in the picture.

35:33.230 --> 35:35.323
He's been living here with me
since his release,

35:35.360 --> 35:36.190
keeping his nose clean.

35:36.230 --> 35:38.790
Soon as I saw
that man was murdered,

35:38.830 --> 35:40.798
I knew you'd come.

35:40.830 --> 35:43.367
LISA:
"I will put my spirit on him,

35:43.400 --> 35:46.403
and he will proclaim justice
to the nations."

35:48.740 --> 35:50.469
What are you doing? Burns,

35:50.510 --> 35:52.239
what is she doing?
The words

35:52.280 --> 35:54.942
Lisa Martinez just spoke, they
were on Rhonda Manning's wall.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.346
He was a man of dignity,
a man of humor.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.382
Yeah, hi.
I'd like to speak

35:59.420 --> 36:00.648
to Lisa Martinez, please.

36:00.690 --> 36:02.681
Uh, no.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.722
No message.
Thank you.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.923
Lisa Martinez hasn't been
in the office the last few days.

36:07.960 --> 36:11.361
Apparently... she's grieving.

36:13.730 --> 36:15.391
Detectives?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.192
Mind if we come inside?

36:17.240 --> 36:19.504
It's not really a good time.

36:19.540 --> 36:22.304
You have your whole career
and life ahead of you--

36:22.340 --> 36:24.444
a promising one,
from what I hear.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.243
So think really hard,

36:26.280 --> 36:28.316
Lisa, do you
want to do this?

36:35.460 --> 36:37.712
CARRIE:
Look who's here. Hi.

36:40.030 --> 36:41.895
Lisa, I know

36:41.930 --> 36:43.659
you're hiding
Shawn Manning.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.463
What?

36:45.500 --> 36:48.663
We also know...
he didn't rape Rupa Nair.

36:48.700 --> 36:51.362
AL:
And we know he didn't
kill Chris Jenkins

36:51.410 --> 36:52.331
or Bobby Cordero.

36:52.370 --> 36:53.598
Well, if you know all that,

36:53.640 --> 36:54.834
why don't you leave him alone?

36:54.880 --> 36:55.972
Look, I understand why

36:56.010 --> 36:57.568
you're trying
to protect him, I do.

36:57.610 --> 36:58.975
The system conspired

36:59.010 --> 37:01.740
to send him to prison
for a crime he didn't commit.

37:01.780 --> 37:03.316
That same system

37:03.350 --> 37:04.783
is looking
for him now.

37:04.820 --> 37:05.980
And the longer

37:06.020 --> 37:09.456
he's out there,
the more danger he's in.

37:09.490 --> 37:10.787
Why should we trust you?

37:10.820 --> 37:12.481
Wh

37:12.530 --> 37:15.328
I give you my word,

37:15.360 --> 37:17.396
if you bring me to Shawn,

37:17.430 --> 37:19.421
I'll make this right.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.791
I promise you
I will.

37:31.010 --> 37:33.001
You mean that?

37:38.080 --> 37:39.980
So as of right now,
my office will be

37:40.020 --> 37:41.612
assuming the investigation
of the murders

37:41.660 --> 37:44.720
of Christopher Jenkins
and Robert Cordero.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.955
Shawn Manning has been
terrorizing the people

37:46.990 --> 37:48.491
of this city for too long.

37:48.530 --> 37:49.690
Questions?

37:51.100 --> 37:52.067
Tom.

37:52.100 --> 37:54.898
What are you thinking
in terms of motive here?

37:54.940 --> 37:57.363
Revenge against people
he holds responsible?

37:57.400 --> 37:58.606
Yes, Tom.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.528
My office believes that Manning

38:00.570 --> 38:04.472
felt that Mr. Jenkins mishandled
his defense 13 years ago.

38:04.510 --> 38:05.772
We also believe

38:05.810 --> 38:08.040
that Manning became obsessed

38:08.080 --> 38:10.446
with Mr. Cordero,
seeking to blame him

38:10.480 --> 38:12.448
for the Central Park crime.

38:13.790 --> 38:15.451
FROST:
In the back.
WOMAN: Yes, sir.

38:15.490 --> 38:17.458
How confident are you
about apprehending Manning?

38:17.490 --> 38:18.718
Let me say this.

38:18.760 --> 38:21.354
Everyone in law enforcement
in this city

38:21.400 --> 38:23.721
understands that the emotions
of that terrible time

38:23.760 --> 38:24.988
have been rekindled.

38:25.030 --> 38:27.419
Like all of us,

38:27.470 --> 38:30.928
I want to see them put to rest
once and for all.

38:30.970 --> 38:32.107
Eliot.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.440
The NYPD agrees.

38:37.480 --> 38:42.110
It is time to close the books
on this case.

38:42.150 --> 38:45.347
We need to get a killer
off the streets.

38:45.390 --> 38:48.655
But swift justice is...
not always true justice.

38:48.690 --> 38:51.682
Sometimes it takes a _little
longer to get things right.

38:51.730 --> 38:55.029
And it is in that spirit
that I am pleased to announce

38:55.060 --> 38:57.358
that the Major Crimes Section
of the NYPD

38:57.400 --> 39:00.062
is about to make
an arrest

39:00.100 --> 39:01.124
mmsmm.

39:03.770 --> 39:06.466
ELIOT:
Some of you will recognize
Shawn Manning.

39:09.580 --> 39:12.003
But his is not the arrest
we are here to announce.

39:12.050 --> 39:15.679
Rather, I would
like to announce

39:15.720 --> 39:17.813
that Assistant District Attorney
Gordon Frost

39:17.850 --> 39:20.580
is under arrest for the murders

39:20.620 --> 39:23.418
of Christopher Jenkins
and Robert Cordero,
and for obstruction

39:23.460 --> 39:25.678
of justice
in the rape prosecution

39:25.730 --> 39:28.449
of Shawn Manning.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.592
Furthermore,

39:29.630 --> 39:31.791
as per a search
warrant executed

39:31.830 --> 39:33.866
on Mr. Frost's car an hour ago,

39:33.900 --> 39:36.437
a nine-millimeter handgun
was discovered

39:36.470 --> 39:39.701
_wh_ich in_itial forensics
indicate is the weapon

39:39.740 --> 39:42.573
used to kill
both Christopher Jenkins

39:42.610 --> 39:44.646
and Robert Cordero.

39:46.110 --> 39:47.577
Maybe you'll

39:47.610 --> 39:48.918
get lucky and they'll treat you

39:48.950 --> 39:50.838
more fairly than
they treated Shawn,

39:50.880 --> 39:52.518
but you don't deserve it.

39:52.550 --> 39:55.383
(reporters continue
shouting questions)

39:56.760 --> 39:59.524
WOMAN:
What made you think
you could keep things quiet?

39:59.560 --> 40:01.118
(reporters continue
shouting questions)

40:11.540 --> 40:13.599
It will take a little time,

40:13.640 --> 40:18.543
but your record will be expunged
and your name cleared.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.878
My name cleared...

40:20.910 --> 40:22.514
We matched

40:22.550 --> 40:24.177
Cordero's DNA to samples

40:24.220 --> 40:26.814
from_the clothes_
Rupa Nair was wearing.

40:28.620 --> 40:31.680
Not that what I say matters...

40:31.730 --> 40:34.927
but I'm sorry for everything
you had to go through.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.121
I feel worse for Chris.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.930
I mean, however
longittook”.

40:41.970 --> 40:45.531
at least I still get
to walk out of here now.

40:52.810 --> 40:54.812
*

40:57.150 --> 40:59.516
Hello again.

40:59.550 --> 41:01.245
Hi.

41:01.290 --> 41:04.009
I've heard you're
looking for a job.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.527
Yeah.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.996
We need an orderly
on the pediatric floor.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.498
Pay's not great,
but...

41:13.530 --> 41:16.738
you'd have a friend there.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.972
*

41:27.010 --> 41:28.978
Well,

41:29.020 --> 41:30.009
was I right?

41:30.050 --> 41:32.211
Yeah. No, it's nice.

41:32.250 --> 41:33.888
900 square feet
in this neighborhood?

41:33.920 --> 41:35.217
You can't beat it.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.216
And you really think
the asking price'll do it?

41:37.260 --> 41:40.149
I'm sorry, one sec.

41:40.190 --> 41:42.090
There a problem?

41:42.130 --> 41:44.189
Another agent showed it
to a client earlier today,

41:44.230 --> 41:46.596
and he is also making an offer.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.291
In fact, he should be here.

41:48.330 --> 41:51.197
How much
Hold on a minute. I'll beat
whatever he's offering.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.901
No, no, no.
I was here first.

41:52.940 --> 41:56.831
I'm sorry, Al, but I do have
an ethical duty to take each

41:56.880 --> 41:57.972
and every offer
to the seller. I...

41:58.010 --> 41:59.079
did try to
reach you.

42:00.950 --> 42:02.815
CARRIE:
Besides, your red couch,
there's no way

42:02.850 --> 42:03.874
it's gonna fit
in that living room.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.889
AL:
Well, I hate to tell you,
I got rid of it.

42:08.990 --> 42:10.059
Okay, what do we do...

42:10.090 --> 42:11.955
Wait a second.

42:11.990 --> 42:14.185
I remember you.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.255
From that other place
we looked at.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.892
Okay, all right.

42:17.930 --> 42:19.727
You're working with Paula,
aren't you?

42:19.770 --> 42:22.091
CARRIE:
Trying to jack up the price,
get a little bidding war going?

42:22.140 --> 42:23.596
Huh?

42:23.640 --> 42:25.801
You know, I should arrest
the both of you.

42:25.840 --> 42:29.071
That's what I should do--
my ethical duty, you know?

42:30.240 --> 42:31.844
I-I guess I could, um...

42:31.880 --> 42:33.575
I could talk
to the seller.

42:33.610 --> 42:35.009
Um, we could...
make a deal.

42:35.050 --> 42:37.268
Forget it.
I lost interest.

42:37.320 --> 42:39.311
Let's go.
What? N...

42:41.620 --> 42:43.850
We had her right
where we wanted her.

42:43.890 --> 42:45.858
It's okay.
I'll find a place.

42:45.890 --> 42:47.585
Or maybe I won't.

42:47.630 --> 42:50.622
The fact is, I'm doing pretty
good in the one-ones for now.

42:50.660 --> 42:52.196
I like living
in the same borough.

42:52.230 --> 42:53.720
There's something
cozy about it.

42:53.770 --> 42:56.864
Did you just say "cozy"?

42:56.900 --> 42:58.663
You know what?
Fine, move to Manhattan,

42:58.710 --> 43:00.359
see if I care.
Well, I can't now.

43:00.410 --> 43:02.833
I finally bought a new sofa.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.006
You should
come over...

43:04.040 --> 43:06.099
tonight and try it out.

43:06.150 --> 43:08.914
Yeah, I can't.
I got to... I got to...

43:08.950 --> 43:10.178
wash my hair.
Oh, fine.

43:10.220 --> 43:11.847
It's a really nice couch.

43:11.890 --> 43:14.188
I bet it is. But you know
what's gonna happen.

43:14.220 --> 43:15.915
First the couch,

43:15.960 --> 43:17.109
thenits
the lemon sole,

43:17.160 --> 43:19.321
then the next thing you know...

43:19.360 --> 43:22.022
I'm cleaning your closet.
