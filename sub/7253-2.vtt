00:03.128 --> 00:04.755
I'M NOT GOING BACK TO YALE

00:03.128 --> 00:04.755
NEXT YEAR.

00:04.797 --> 00:05.714
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

00:05.756 --> 00:06.882
THIS WAS HER DREAM.

00:06.924 --> 00:07.967
I AM NOT GOING TO LET THIS

00:06.924 --> 00:07.967
HAPPEN.

00:08.008 --> 00:08.968
LUKE, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.218

00:12.638 --> 00:13.806
KEY TO THE MAIN HOUSE,

00:13.848 --> 00:15.432
KEY TO THE GARAGE.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.600
SHE WANTS TO BE ON HER OWN.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.600
FINE, SHE'S ON HER OWN.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.602

00:23.858 --> 00:25.233

00:28.111 --> 00:30.071

00:30.113 --> 00:31.615
YOU FINALLY GOT A SHOT

00:31.657 --> 00:33.325

00:31.657 --> 00:33.325
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.537
I'M OUT. YOU WON.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.537
SHE'S ALL YOURS.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.873
THERE'S A RUMOR THAT

00:36.578 --> 00:38.873
THERE'S BEEN A RIFT.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.958
WHAT HAPPENED, AND HOW'S

00:38.914 --> 00:40.958
LORELAI TAKING IT?

00:41.000 --> 00:44.085
LORELAI HAS IT COMPLETELY

00:41.000 --> 00:44.085
UNDER CONTROL.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.216
[ SIGHS ] IT'S BIG.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.885
THAT'S WHAT<i> SHE</i> SAID.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.885
GOOD ONE.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.178
HEY, I'M STILL 12.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.178
BUT I MEANT

00:50.926 --> 00:53.178

00:54.680 --> 00:56.557

00:58.141 --> 00:59.935
12 ROOMS?

00:59.977 --> 01:01.228
AT LEAST.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.980
YOU COULD GO TO TOWN

01:01.269 --> 01:02.980
IN THIS PLACE.

01:03.022 --> 01:04.648
YOU COULD HAVE

01:03.022 --> 01:04.648
A DEDICATED SEWING ROOM.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.107
I MEAN,

01:04.690 --> 01:06.107
THAT'S A NO-BRAINER.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.193
I COULD PUT A WHOLE LOOM

01:06.149 --> 01:08.193
IN ONE OF THOSE ROOMS,

01:08.235 --> 01:10.612
INDULGE MY LONG-HARBORED

DESIRE TO MAKE TAPESTRIES.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.031

01:37.973 --> 01:39.767
PLEASE, DON'T GIVE ME

01:37.973 --> 01:39.767
THE WHOLE LITANY,

01:39.808 --> 01:41.977
ESPECIALLY ONE THAT SOUNDS

01:39.808 --> 01:41.977
LIKE A KENNY CHESNEY SONG.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.520
I'M JUST BEING HONEST.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.397
I'M NOT GOING TO BOLT.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.232
I'M STAYING PUT.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.818
GOOD, BECAUSE THE EYES

01:47.274 --> 01:49.818
WILL GIVE YOU AWAY.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.361
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:49.860 --> 01:51.361
IF YOU THINK OF BOLTING,

01:51.403 --> 01:53.697
THEY'LL POP OUT ON YOU

01:51.403 --> 01:53.697
LIKE THAT RUNAWAY BRIDE.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.950
IT'S LIKE THE EYES ARE TRYING

01:53.739 --> 01:55.950
TO RUN AWAY FIRST.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.869
SOOKIE,

01:55.991 --> 01:58.869
LOOK AT MY EYES.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.869
OKAY.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.538
HOW DO THEY LOOK?

01:58.911 --> 02:01.538
PRETTY SOCKED IN THERE.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.206
AND THERE

02:01.580 --> 02:03.206
THEY WILL REMAIN.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.917
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.917
PROMISE.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.002

02:04.959 --> 02:07.002

IS IT ME OR --

02:11.090 --> 02:12.091
NOPE.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.467
I THINK IT JUST

02:12.132 --> 02:13.467
GOT BIGGER.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.635
THAT'S WHAT

02:13.508 --> 02:14.635
<i>SHE</i> SAID.

02:14.676 --> 02:15.970
GOOD GRIEF.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.178

03:30.127 --> 03:32.420

03:30.127 --> 03:32.420

03:34.089 --> 03:35.799
THEY OUTLINE SAFETY PROCEDURES,

03:35.841 --> 03:38.218
BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS,

03:35.841 --> 03:38.218
ET CETERA.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.179
IF YOU CAUSE ANY TROUBLE,

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
YOU<i> WILL</i> COME BACK HERE

03:40.220 --> 03:42.222
TO SEE ME,

03:42.263 --> 03:43.849
SOMETHING I DO NOT WANT

03:42.263 --> 03:43.849
TO HAPPEN.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.226
NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT

03:43.891 --> 03:46.226
WHAT YOU WILL NOT BRING.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.937
FIRST ON THE LIST --

03:46.267 --> 03:48.937
WEAPONS OF ANY KIND.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.481
I'LL STATE THE OBVIOUS FIRST.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.481
YOU WILL NOT BRING A GUN.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.067
YOU WILL NOT BRING CHAINS.

03:53.108 --> 03:56.070
YOU WILL NOT BRING KNIVES OF ANY

03:53.108 --> 03:56.070
KIND, INCLUDING PENKNIVES,

03:56.111 --> 03:58.072
NAIL FILES, RAZOR BLADES,

03:56.111 --> 03:58.072
CARPET CUTTERS.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.322
YOU WILL NOT BRING ROPE.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.033
YOU WILL NOT BRING

03:59.364 --> 04:01.033
BRASS KNUCKLES

04:01.075 --> 04:03.243
OR ANYTHING THAT CAN BE USED

04:01.075 --> 04:03.243
AS A TRUNCHEON.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.995
AND THEY HAVE

04:03.284 --> 04:04.995
THOSE FLASHLIGHT THINGIES...

04:05.037 --> 04:07.372
THAT'S THE RIGHT NAME FOR

04:05.037 --> 04:07.372
THOSE -- FLASHLIGHT THINGIES.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.999
...AND JEDI POWERS

04:07.414 --> 04:08.999
OF MIND CONTROL,

04:09.041 --> 04:10.667
AND THEY CAN MOVE THINGS,

04:09.041 --> 04:10.667
SO THEY'RE TELEKINETIC.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.961
AND THEY HOVER ON THEIR

04:10.709 --> 04:12.961
JET SAUCERS OVER MOLTEN LAVA,

04:13.003 --> 04:15.130
AND THEY CAN JUMP AND FLY LIKE

04:13.003 --> 04:15.130
THEY'RE IN CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.798
AH, COFFEE, PLEASE.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.926
BUT WHAT GIVES ONE JEDI KNIGHT

04:16.840 --> 04:18.926
THE EDGE OVER THE OTHER, HUH?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.010
THE ULTIMATE ADVANTAGE.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.803
THEY STAND

04:20.052 --> 04:21.803
ON A MOUND OF DIRT

04:21.845 --> 04:24.389
AND DECLARE, "YOU CAN'T WIN.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.389
I'VE GOT THE HIGH GROUND."

04:24.431 --> 04:26.558
DUDE, IF HE SAID IT,

04:24.431 --> 04:26.558
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.851
IT'S A FICTIONAL WORLD.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.644
HE'S FOUR FEET UP

04:27.893 --> 04:29.644
A LITTLE SLOPE.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.772
THAT WIPES OUT THE OTHER GUYS'

04:29.686 --> 04:31.772
POWERS TO FLY, JUMP AROUND,

04:31.813 --> 04:33.774
MOVE THINGS WITH HIS BRAIN,

04:31.813 --> 04:33.774
USE HIS FLASHLIGHT THINGY?

04:33.815 --> 04:36.526
YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN

04:33.815 --> 04:36.526
THE RIGHT TERM FOR

04:33.815 --> 04:36.526
THAT FLASHLIGHT THINGY.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.861
THIS HAS BEEN BUGGING ME.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.446
FOR MONTHS --

04:37.903 --> 04:39.446
WE SAW THAT MOVIE MONTHS AGO.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.989
YOU'VE GOT TO LET IT GO.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.909
I CAN'T.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.909
GEORGE LUCAS OWNS

04:41.031 --> 04:43.909
SAN FRANCISCO NOW.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.953
THAT'S A CITY. YOU CAN'T ARGUE

04:43.951 --> 04:45.953
WITH A MAN WHO OWNS A CITY.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.122
ALL THE OTHER GUY HAS TO DO

04:45.994 --> 04:48.122
IS SCURRY ONTO LAND,

04:48.163 --> 04:50.331
RUN UP A HILL A BIT,

04:48.163 --> 04:50.331
AND THEN HE HAS THE HIGH GROUND.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.709
I MEAN, THEY CAN FLY JETPODS,

04:50.373 --> 04:52.709
BUT THEY CAN'T SCURRY?

04:52.751 --> 04:54.419
GO ON A WEBSITE

04:52.751 --> 04:54.419
OR SOMETHING, OKAY?

04:54.461 --> 04:55.796
'CAUSE THERE ARE

04:54.461 --> 04:55.796
THOUSANDS --

04:55.837 --> 04:57.881
NO,<i> MILLIONS</i> OF YOUR KIND

04:55.837 --> 04:57.881
OUT THERE

04:57.923 --> 05:00.926
DEBATING ALL THE MINUTIAE OF NOT

04:57.923 --> 05:00.926
JUST THIS "STAR WARS" MOVIE,

05:00.968 --> 05:02.343
BUT EVERY

05:00.968 --> 05:02.343
"STAR WARS" MOVIE.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.263
YOU DRAG ME

05:02.385 --> 05:04.263
TO SEE THESE MOVIES.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.430
NO, YOU WANTED

05:04.304 --> 05:05.430
TO SEE THAT MOVIE.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.765
SO I CAN'T CRITIQUE IT?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.100
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.727
WHAT ABOUT "BEWITCHED"?

21:42.260 --> 21:44.678
I'LL MAKE SOME APPOINTMENTS

21:42.260 --> 21:44.678

21:44.720 --> 21:48.390
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.059
HAVE YOU MET DRAGUTA?

21:50.101 --> 21:56.899
SHE'S FROM ROMANIA.

21:50.101 --> 21:56.899
HI.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.789
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.789
I FORGOT.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.833
YOU DON'T LIKE THE STAIRS.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.001
COME ON, PAUL ANKA.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.002
[ STRAINS ]

22:16.043 --> 22:17.377
THAT'S RIGHT.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.421
I'M SKIPPING THE FANCY

22:17.419 --> 22:19.421
IN-BETWEEN THING

22:19.463 --> 22:20.881
AND GOING STRAIGHT FOR THE GOLD.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.383
I'M CALLING YOU PAUL ANKA,

22:20.923 --> 22:23.383
PAUL ANKA THE DOG.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.016
OH, EXCUSE ME.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.349
RORY, WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.102
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU

22:31.391 --> 22:33.102
EARLIER.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.353
YOU WERE?

22:33.144 --> 22:35.353
COME IN. SIT WITH US

22:33.144 --> 22:35.353
FOR A MINUTE.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.982
THIS IS RORY?

22:35.395 --> 22:37.982
SHE'S MADE

22:35.395 --> 22:37.982
OF PORCELAIN.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.650
I DIDN'T MEAN

22:38.024 --> 22:39.650
TO INTERRUPT.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.819
BEAUTIFUL SKIN.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.819
LIKE ONE

22:39.692 --> 22:41.819
OF YOUR LLADROS.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.155
I WANT TO MINIATURIZE HER

22:41.861 --> 22:44.155
AND SET HER ON MY MANTEL.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.614
YOU'VE INTERRUPTED

22:44.197 --> 22:45.614
NOTHING.

22:45.656 --> 22:47.574
NORA WAS JUST

22:45.656 --> 22:47.574
DEFENDING HER CHOICE.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.827
HER CHOICE?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.827
COVER YOUR EARS, RORY.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.787
IT'S ALEXANDER HAMILTON,

22:49.869 --> 22:51.787
NO DEBATE.

22:51.829 --> 22:52.454
OVER WASHINGTON.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.831
AND JEFFERSON.

22:53.873 --> 22:58.127
DIRECT, PROUD, THAT CHIN

22:53.873 --> 22:58.127
AND THOSE BLAZING EYES.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.670
THEY'RE DISCUSSING

22:58.169 --> 22:59.670
THE FOREFATHERS.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.047
<i>CHOOSING,</i>

22:59.712 --> 23:01.047
TO BE MORE ACCURATE.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.131
WHICH WAS THE GREATEST?

23:02.173 --> 23:03.132
LOVER.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.382
OH, DEAR.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.384
GIRLS, PLEASE.

23:04.424 --> 23:06.384
SHE'S JUST A CHILD.

23:06.426 --> 23:09.096
MOST OF US PICKED

23:06.426 --> 23:09.096
WASHINGTON OR JEFFERSON.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.307
THERE WAS ONE VOTE

23:09.138 --> 23:11.307
FOR JAMES MADISON.

23:11.349 --> 23:12.516
TWO ABSTENTIONS.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.935
AND I CHOSE THE STUD

23:12.558 --> 23:14.935
ON THE 10.

23:14.977 --> 23:17.771
IT'S THE DRINKS. I HAVE TO

23:14.977 --> 23:17.771
START WATERING THEM DOWN.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.606
SO, WE FINALLY MEET

23:17.813 --> 23:19.606
THE FAMOUS RORY.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.150
I'M FAMOUS?

23:19.648 --> 23:21.150
YOU'RE WANTED.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.276
SHE'S PERFECT FOR US.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.777
FOR WHAT?

23:23.819 --> 23:26.655
A JOB'S OPENED UP AT OUR

23:23.819 --> 23:26.655
D.A.R. OFFICE DOWNTOWN.

23:26.697 --> 23:29.242
WE NEED SOMEONE SMART,

23:26.697 --> 23:29.242
SHARP-LOOKING.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.035

23:29.283 --> 23:31.035
ARE EXTREMELY FLEXIBLE.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.371
IT JUST FELL INTO OUR LAPS.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.371
ISN'T THAT SOMETHING?

23:33.411 --> 23:34.955
YES.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.333
YOU CAN EVEN WORK FROM HOME.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.333
IT'S MOSTLY PHONE WORK.

23:37.375 --> 23:39.252
YOU'D BE PERFECT

23:37.375 --> 23:39.252
FOR US.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.503
WELL, THANK YOU ALL

23:41.545 --> 23:42.880
AND, YES, IT DOES

23:41.545 --> 23:42.880
SOUND PERFECT.

23:42.922 --> 23:43.756
GOOD.

23:43.797 --> 23:45.549
WHEN DID YOU JOIN, RORY?

23:45.591 --> 23:47.467
JOIN?

23:45.591 --> 23:47.467

23:47.509 --> 23:49.387
OH, WELL,

23:47.509 --> 23:49.387
I HAVEN'T.

23:49.427 --> 23:50.763
YET.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.348
SHE'D HAVE TO JOIN

23:50.804 --> 23:52.348
TO WORK IN THE OFFICE.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.058
OH.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.058
DON'T WORRY.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.144
THE TERM "SHOO-IN" WAS COINED

23:54.100 --> 23:57.144
FOR A FIGURINE LIKE YOU.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.188
DON'T WORRY. THE PAPERWORK'S

23:57.186 --> 23:59.188
ALL FILLED OUT AND READY.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.565
IT'S A FORMALITY.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.565
DO YOU NOT EAT?

23:59.230 --> 24:01.565
DO YOU NOT DRINK?

24:01.607 --> 24:03.525
THE IRISH COFFEE

24:01.607 --> 24:03.525
IS ASTOUNDING.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.694
OH, YES. RORY, OUR MEETING'S

24:07.154 --> 24:09.531

Um...

24:20.251 --> 24:22.962
my community service.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.504
You were supposed

24:23.003 --> 24:24.504
to drive me.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.133
OH, YES.

24:24.546 --> 24:27.133

24:47.945 --> 24:50.030

24:50.072 --> 24:51.615
GOOD BOY.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.784
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF JUMPING.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.784
THAT'S SOMETHING.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.080
UH, EXCUSE ME.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.957
HELLO.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.251

I'M GEORGE.

25:02.293 --> 25:05.379
HI, GEORGE.

25:05.421 --> 25:08.132
I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK OF HOW

25:05.421 --> 25:08.132
TO ASK THIS IN A POLITE WAY.

25:08.174 --> 25:10.343
UM, ARE YOU COMMITTING

25:08.174 --> 25:10.343
SOME SORT OF CRIME?

25:10.384 --> 25:11.551
NO.

25:11.593 --> 25:14.013
BUT IF YOU WERE,

25:11.593 --> 25:14.013
WOULD YOU TELL ME?

25:14.054 --> 25:15.639
HELLO.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.639

25:15.681 --> 25:17.099
FIGHT OR FLIGHT?

25:17.141 --> 25:19.101
HEY!

LUKE.

25:19.143 --> 25:20.436

25:19.143 --> 25:20.436
OH, WE'VE MET.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.561
I'M SAUL.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.561
HI, SAUL.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.022

25:21.603 --> 25:23.022

SAUL, DID YOU GET

25:23.063 --> 25:25.316
WHAT YOU NEED?

25:23.063 --> 25:25.316
JUST ABOUT.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.901
WOW. I WAS THIS CLOSE

25:25.358 --> 25:27.901
TO SCREAMING

25:27.943 --> 25:29.278
AND SICCING THE DOG

25:27.943 --> 25:29.278
ON YOU.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.072
HOW DID YOU GET

25:29.320 --> 25:32.072
THAT DOOR CLOSED?

25:32.114 --> 25:33.824
WE'RE JUST

25:32.114 --> 25:33.824
ABOUT DONE.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.908
DONE WITH WHAT?

25:34.950 --> 25:35.951
SIZING THE SITUATION.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.411
WHAT SITUATION?

25:37.453 --> 25:40.080
ABOUT HOW MANY SILENT JOISTS

25:37.453 --> 25:40.080
WE NEED TO CARRY OUT.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.041
WHAT'S A JOIST?

25:40.122 --> 25:42.041
THE THINGS THAT

25:40.122 --> 25:42.041
SUPPORT THE LOAD.

25:42.082 --> 25:44.084
WHAT LOAD?

25:42.082 --> 25:44.084
THE LOAD

25:42.082 --> 25:44.084
FROM THE EXTENSION.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.919
OKAY, THIS HAS OFFICIALLY

25:44.126 --> 25:45.919
BECOME THE WORST FIRST DRAFT

25:45.961 --> 25:47.505
OF "WHO'S ON FIRST?"

25:45.961 --> 25:47.505
IN HISTORY.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.756
IT'S ABOUT ENLARGING

25:47.545 --> 25:49.756
THE BEDROOM TO LIVE HERE.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.800
HERE? YOU WANT

25:49.798 --> 25:51.800
TO LIVE HERE?

25:51.842 --> 25:53.635
SURE.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.513
I DON'T HAVE A LOT

25:53.677 --> 25:55.513
OF STUFF, AND WE JUST

25:53.677 --> 25:55.513
NEED MORE CLOSET SPACE,

25:55.553 --> 25:57.014
A BIGGER BATHROOM,

25:55.553 --> 25:57.014
BIGGER BEDROOM.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.474
I ALWAYS WANTED

25:57.056 --> 25:58.474
A BIGGER BEDROOM.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.100
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE

25:58.516 --> 26:00.100
WE CAN DO IT.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.685
WELL, WHAT ABOUT

26:00.142 --> 26:01.685
THE TWICKHAM HOUSE?

26:01.727 --> 26:03.187
TOO DAMN BIG.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.523
WE CAN GET ALONG FINE HERE

26:03.229 --> 26:05.523
FOR A WHILE, MAYBE FOREVER.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.858
IT'S A GREAT HOUSE.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.858
YOU LOVE THIS HOUSE.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.276
I DO LOVE THIS HOUSE.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.153
I FIGURED THAT OUT

26:09.318 --> 26:11.153
FROM YOUR SUDDEN INTEREST

26:11.195 --> 26:12.905
IN LAYING DOWN TRACKS

26:11.195 --> 26:12.905
AND BECOMING A PAINTER.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.782
COME DOWN HERE SO I CAN

26:12.946 --> 26:15.782
KISS YOU,<i> ALL</i> OF YOU.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.951
WE'LL JUST BE

26:15.824 --> 26:17.951
A MINUTE.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.501
YOU LOCKED THE DOOR?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.501
DUDE, COME ON.

26:25.543 --> 26:26.960
I MEAN,

26:25.543 --> 26:26.960
I'VE GOT THE KEY,

26:27.002 --> 26:30.756
BUT I'M REALLY CURIOUS

26:27.002 --> 26:30.756
HOW YOU DID THIS.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.348
LET'S SEE WHAT ELSE.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.849
"WHEN YOU'RE EATING

26:39.390 --> 26:40.849
IN THE MESS HALL,

26:40.891 --> 26:42.684
NEVER REACH ACROSS

26:40.891 --> 26:42.684
THE PRISONER NEXT TO YOU."

26:42.726 --> 26:45.438
IT'S A PROVOCATION. IT'LL

26:42.726 --> 26:45.438
GET YOU A FORK IN YOUR HAND.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.189
I DON'T THINK THERE'S

26:45.479 --> 26:47.189
GOING TO BE A MESS HALL.

26:47.231 --> 26:49.607
WELL, WHEREVER YOU'RE EATING,

26:47.231 --> 26:49.607
THAT WOULD APPLY.

26:49.649 --> 26:52.819
WHAT ELSE? "DON'T BE ARROGANT."

26:49.649 --> 26:52.819
BUT YOU'RE NOT ARROGANT.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.363
"DON'T LET ANYONE

26:52.861 --> 26:54.363
GIVE YOU ANYTHING

26:54.405 --> 26:56.156
"OR LEND YOU ANYTHING,

26:54.405 --> 26:56.156
PERIOD.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.867
IT CAN GET YOU INJURED

26:56.198 --> 26:58.867
OR KILLED OR TURNED OUT."

26:58.909 --> 27:00.411
I'M NOT SURE WHAT

26:58.909 --> 27:00.411
"TURNED OUT" MEANS,

27:00.453 --> 27:02.037
BUT THEY'RE VERY CAREFUL

27:00.453 --> 27:02.037
TO WARN YOU OFF IT.

27:02.079 --> 27:03.456
GOT IT.

27:03.497 --> 27:05.458
NOW, "IF SOMEBODY APPROACHES

27:03.497 --> 27:05.458
YOU WITH A SHIV" --

27:05.499 --> 27:07.585
DO YOU KNOW WHAT

27:05.499 --> 27:07.585
A SHIV IS, GRANDMA?

27:07.625 --> 27:10.628
NO, WHAT IS IT?

27:07.625 --> 27:10.628
IT'S LIKE A CRUDE KNIFE,

27:07.625 --> 27:10.628
CARVED FROM A SODA CAN.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.048
OH...THAT MUST BE WHY

27:10.670 --> 27:13.048
THEY ADVISE YOU

27:13.090 --> 27:15.175
TO "YELL FOR A HACK

27:13.090 --> 27:15.175
TO COME HELP YOU."

27:15.217 --> 27:18.304
WHAT'S A HACK?

27:15.217 --> 27:18.304
WHERE DID YOU

27:15.217 --> 27:18.304
GET THIS, GRANDMA?

27:18.345 --> 27:20.139
I HAD YOUR GRANDFATHER'S

27:18.345 --> 27:20.139
SECRETARY FIND ME INFO

27:20.180 --> 27:21.974
ON INTERACTING

27:20.180 --> 27:21.974
WITH FELLOW PRISONERS.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.560
BUT WE'RE NOT PRISONERS. WE'RE

27:22.015 --> 27:24.560
JUST DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.312
THEY LOOK LIKE PRISONERS.

27:26.353 --> 27:29.106
WELL, YOU KNOW, SITTING HERE

27:26.353 --> 27:29.106
IN THE JAG STARING AT THEM

27:29.148 --> 27:30.816
IS PROBABLY NOT GOING

27:29.148 --> 27:30.816
TO HELP MY POPULARITY.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.443
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.236
THAT'S ON THE LIST, TOO --

27:32.485 --> 27:34.236
STARING -- IT'S BAD.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.737
YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT FOR MORE

27:34.278 --> 27:35.737
THAN ONE OR TWO SECONDS.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.448
I WON'T.

27:37.490 --> 27:40.200
AND THEY EMPHASIZE THAT YOU

27:37.490 --> 27:40.200
"KEEP YOUR FIGHT FACE AT HOME."

27:40.242 --> 27:42.369
I'M GUESSING THAT'S ANY SORT

27:40.242 --> 27:42.369
OF AGGRESSIVE EXPRESSION,

27:42.411 --> 27:44.037
WHETHER YOU'RE STARING

27:42.411 --> 27:44.037
AT THE PERSON OR NOT.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.663
FIGHT FACE --

27:44.079 --> 27:45.663
REMEMBER THAT.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.874
OKAY. I'LL BE FINE, GRANDMA.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.874
THANKS FOR DRIVING ME.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.209
WAIT.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.004
HERE. THAT'S BETTER

27:49.251 --> 27:52.004
THAN A PAPER BAG.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.380
YES, IT IS.

27:53.422 --> 27:54.548
OH, AND HERE.

27:54.590 --> 27:55.924
CIGARETTES?

27:55.966 --> 27:58.344
TO BARTER. IT'S CURRENCY

27:55.966 --> 27:58.344
TO THESE PEOPLE.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.928
THANK YOU, GRANDMA.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.928
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I'M DONE.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.349
BYE, NOW. AND REMEMBER,

27:59.970 --> 28:03.349
DON'T STARE.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.864
ANYONE WANT A SMOKE?

28:18.905 --> 28:20.616
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE

28:18.905 --> 28:20.616
ON YOUR EXTRAS.

28:20.658 --> 28:22.159
WE CAN SLAP UP

28:20.658 --> 28:22.159
SOME MOLDING.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.161
YEAH, MOLDING'S GOOD.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.161
LORELAI WILL LIKE THAT.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.788
SHE WILL.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.788
SHE WILL LIKE THAT.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.999
LET'S FIGURE ON MOLDING

28:26.830 --> 28:28.999
OF SOME KIND.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.209
GOOD.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.002
WE CAN ADD

28:30.250 --> 28:32.002
A WAINSCOT, TOO,

28:32.044 --> 28:34.796
AND WE COULD DO A LUGGED

28:32.044 --> 28:34.796
ARCHITRAVE ON THE OVERDOOR.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.796
GREAT.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.924
OH, I LOVE

28:34.838 --> 28:37.924
A LUGGED ARCHITRAVE.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.924
LIZ.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.843
OH, HI. I'M LIZ.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.387
MY SISTER.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.387
HI, LIZ.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.096
YOU'RE

28:41.428 --> 28:43.096
AN ARCHITECT, HUH?

28:41.428 --> 28:43.096
YEP.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.723
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN

28:43.138 --> 28:44.723
AN ARCHITECT?

28:44.764 --> 28:46.475
THIS IS NOT

28:44.764 --> 28:46.475
YOUR INTERVIEW, LIZ.

28:46.517 --> 28:48.101
OH, I'M BUTTONING

28:46.517 --> 28:48.101
IT NOW. SORRY.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.520
I NEED TO GO

28:48.143 --> 28:49.520
ANYWAY, LUKE.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.397
WHAT'S YOUR TIME FRAME

28:49.562 --> 28:51.397
HERE, GEORGE?

28:51.438 --> 28:53.899
IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME AT LEAST

28:51.438 --> 28:53.899
TWO WEEKS TO DRAW UP A PLAN.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.360
I'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.360
GOOD DEAL.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.444
GOOD DEAL, GEORGE.

28:57.486 --> 28:59.446
I'LL TALK

28:57.486 --> 28:59.446
TO YOU LATER.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.281
WHAT IS WRONG

28:59.488 --> 29:01.281
WITH YOU?

29:01.323 --> 29:04.326
I'M JUST EXCITED ABOUT ALL THIS.

29:01.323 --> 29:04.326
A NEW ADVENTURE!

29:04.368 --> 29:07.287
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR ADVENTURE.

29:04.368 --> 29:07.287
IT'S MY ADVENTURE.

29:08.497 --> 29:09.873
YOU'RE IN

29:08.497 --> 29:09.873
THE EMPLOYEE SECTION.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.500
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU

29:09.915 --> 29:11.500
ABOUT SOMETHING.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.127
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING BUT TALK.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.127
WHY ANNOUNCE IT NOW?

29:14.169 --> 29:15.879
YOU'RE GOING

29:14.169 --> 29:15.879
TO NEED A CONTRACTOR

29:15.921 --> 29:17.256
FOR YOUR REMODEL,

29:15.921 --> 29:17.256
RIGHT?

29:17.297 --> 29:19.717
YES.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.717
AND YOU KNOW

29:17.297 --> 29:19.717
WHO I'M MARRIED TO.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.843
YES.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.843
HE'D BE PERFECT

29:19.758 --> 29:21.843
FOR THIS.

29:21.885 --> 29:23.845
T.J.? HE'S NOT

29:21.885 --> 29:23.845
A CONTRACTOR.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.723
OH, BUT HE IS.

29:23.887 --> 29:25.723
SINCE WHEN?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.433
SINCE HE ALMOST

29:25.764 --> 29:27.433
PASSED THE TEST

29:27.474 --> 29:29.226
FOR HIS CONTRACTOR'S

29:27.474 --> 29:29.226
LICENSE LAST MONTH.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.561
I MEAN, HE WAS SO CLOSE.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.187
IF HE HADN'T USED

29:30.603 --> 29:32.187
ALL THOSE CURSE WORDS

29:32.229 --> 29:33.939
DURING THE WRITTEN EXAM,

29:32.229 --> 29:33.939
HE'D HAVE HAD IT.

29:33.980 --> 29:35.649
HE USED CURSE WORDS?

29:35.691 --> 29:38.193
WHEN HE'S ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT

29:35.691 --> 29:38.193
SOMETHING, HE GETS VERY FOUL.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.486
BUT I BLAME HIS MOTHER.

29:39.528 --> 29:42.406
SHE HAS GOT A MOUTH ON HER --

29:39.528 --> 29:42.406
GARBAGE MOUTH.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.491
I DON'T THINK

29:42.448 --> 29:44.491
HE CAN DO THE JOB, LIZ.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.992
OH, BUT, MY BROTHER,

29:46.034 --> 29:49.079
HE'S WORKING SO HARD

29:46.034 --> 29:49.079
FOR HIS LICENSE.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.873
YOU SHOULD SEE HIM.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.873
IT IS SO CUTE.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.375
HE SITS UP IN BED

29:51.915 --> 29:53.375
AT NIGHT

29:53.417 --> 29:55.711
PORING THROUGH HIS BOOKS

29:53.417 --> 29:55.711
AND HIS MANUALS.

29:55.753 --> 29:58.213
HE'S GOT THIS SYSTEM

29:55.753 --> 29:58.213
WHERE HE READS A CHAPTER

29:58.255 --> 30:00.382
THEN REWARDS HIMSELF

29:58.255 --> 30:00.382
WITH A JUNIOR MINT.

30:00.424 --> 30:02.134
IT'S BEEN WORKING

30:00.424 --> 30:02.134
GREAT FOR HIM.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.552
THERE IS NO WAY

30:02.175 --> 30:03.552
IN THE WORLD

30:03.594 --> 30:05.387
THAT HE IS GETTING

30:03.594 --> 30:05.387
THIS JOB, LIZ.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.306
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SHELVES

30:05.429 --> 30:07.306
HE MADE YOU?

30:07.347 --> 30:08.515
I THOUGHT

30:07.347 --> 30:08.515
YOU LIKED THEM.

30:08.557 --> 30:09.808
THEY'RE JUST SHELVES.

30:09.849 --> 30:12.436
OH, WHAT HAPPENED

30:09.849 --> 30:12.436
TO THE LITTLE BOY IN YOU?

30:12.478 --> 30:15.731
LOOK, THE SHELVES ARE NICE,

30:12.478 --> 30:15.731
BUT THIS IS A BIG JOB.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.984
LORELAI LOVES THIS HOUSE.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.984
THIS IS A GREAT HOUSE.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.235
LUKE, HIS LIFE

30:19.025 --> 30:20.235
DEPENDS ON IT.

30:20.277 --> 30:21.820
HOW?

30:21.861 --> 30:23.947
BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T GET

30:21.861 --> 30:23.947
HIS ASS OUT OF THE HOUSE

30:23.989 --> 30:25.407
AND WORK MORE,

30:23.989 --> 30:25.407
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.200
THERE'S A HOUSING BOOM

30:25.449 --> 30:27.200
OUT THERE.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.077
THERE'S PLENTY OF WORK FOR

30:27.242 --> 30:29.077
A GOOD CARPENTER LIKE T.J.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.955
BUT EVERY TIME HE INTERVIEWS

30:29.119 --> 30:31.955
FOR JOBS, HE STARTS CURSING.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.873
HE CAN'T HELP IT.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.418
PEOPLE MISTAKE IT FOR HIM

30:33.915 --> 30:36.418
BEING WEIRD OR SOMETHING.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.418
IMAGINE THAT.

30:36.460 --> 30:39.296
PLEASE, BIG BROTHER,

30:36.460 --> 30:39.296
FOR YOUR LITTLE SISTER.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.633

30:39.338 --> 30:42.633
JUST DON'T SAY "NO."

30:39.338 --> 30:42.633
OKAY? JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.217

30:42.675 --> 30:44.217

30:44.259 --> 30:45.803
FOR ME,

30:44.259 --> 30:45.803
THINK ABOUT IT.

30:45.844 --> 30:49.473
OKAY, FINE. I WON'T SAY "NO"

30:45.844 --> 30:49.473
FOR THE TIME BEING.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.433
YES! THANK YOU.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.311

30:51.475 --> 30:54.311

32:43.462 --> 32:45.171

32:45.213 --> 32:47.006
WHY WOULD T.J. COME TO MY HOUSE

32:45.213 --> 32:47.006

32:47.048 --> 32:48.216
DAMN IT, LIZ!

32:47.048 --> 32:48.216
WHAT DID LIZ DO?

32:48.258 --> 32:49.635
AH, SHE WORKED ME OVER.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.887
SHE BEGGED ME TO HIRE T.J.

32:49.676 --> 32:51.887
AS THE CONTRACTOR.

32:51.929 --> 32:54.431
T.J.'S A CONTRACTOR?

32:51.929 --> 32:54.431
NO, AND I SAID "NO."

32:54.473 --> 32:56.057
BUT SHE MADE ME PROMISE

32:54.473 --> 32:56.057
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.059
AND THEN SHE SAT

32:56.099 --> 32:58.059
IN THE DINER STARING AT ME,

32:58.101 --> 33:00.103
AND THEN SHE STARTED TO CRY,

32:58.101 --> 33:00.103
SO I KICKED HER OUT.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.521
AND THEN SHE WENT

33:00.145 --> 33:01.521
OUTSIDE AND CRIED

33:01.563 --> 33:03.189
AND SO I COULD SEE IT

33:01.563 --> 33:03.189
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.484
AND I COULDN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE,

33:03.231 --> 33:05.484
SO I SAID, "OKAY,"

33:05.525 --> 33:07.694
KNOWING WE HAD WEEKS TO FIGURE
