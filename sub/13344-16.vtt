WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:08.309
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.409 --> 00:11.712
I HEAR YOU, PAUL.
YOU WANT TO KICK ME
OUT OF THERAPY. I GET IT.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.282
NO, I DON'T WANT TO KICK
YOU OUT, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.418
I THINK THAT YOU TOSSED
ME OUT A LONG TIME AGO.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.054
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
TREAT YOU AS A PSYCHOLOGIST.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.590
YOU WANT ME TO TREAT YOU
AS SOMEBODY

00:22.690 --> 00:24.258
WHO'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.295
LET'S FACE IT-- I HAVE NOT
BEEN YOUR THERAPIST

00:27.395 --> 00:29.463
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, LAURA.

00:29.563 --> 00:33.134
MAYBE YOU CAN'T
TREAT ME BECAUSE YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH ME TOO?

00:40.808 --> 00:43.311
WHERE YOU HEADED?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.547
YOU NEED A RIDE?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.116
LAURA.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.551
LET'S DO IT.

01:32.993 --> 01:35.596
PAUL?

01:37.998 --> 01:40.601
PAUL?

01:40.701 --> 01:43.304
( theme music playing )

02:00.454 --> 02:03.524
SORRY. UM, YOU SAID
THAT IT--

02:03.624 --> 02:06.194
THAT IT HAPPENED
IN THE KITCHEN?

02:06.294 --> 02:08.662
NO, IT STARTED
IN THE KITCHEN.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.097
ARE YOU
LISTENING TO ME?

02:10.198 --> 02:11.932
YES, YES, I AM.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.668
I SAID I WANTED
TO DO IT RIGHT THERE
ON THE COUNTER.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.837
SO WHEN HE PICKED ME UP,
I THOUGHT, "OKAY,"

02:16.937 --> 02:19.840
BUT NO, HE TOOK ME
INTO THE BEDROOM
AND HE...

02:19.940 --> 02:22.843
PUT ME DOWN EVER SO GENTLY
LIKE I WAS, I DON'T KNOW,

02:22.943 --> 02:25.413
A PORCELAIN VASE
OR SOMETHING.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.048
EVERYTHING WAS VERY
CAUTIOUS, HESITANT--

02:28.148 --> 02:30.083
LIKE HE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:30.184 --> 02:33.086
MAYBE HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH SOMEONE
WHO WASN'T HIS WIFE.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.988
YEAH, HE KEPT
TELLING ME

02:35.088 --> 02:36.957
HE HASN'T DONE IT
WITH ANYONE BUT HIS
WIFE FOR 10 YEARS,

02:37.057 --> 02:39.227
AND HARDLY THEN.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.264
IT WAS VERY SWEET,
ACTUALLY.

02:44.198 --> 02:46.099
HE IMITATED ME.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.270
HE DID EVERYTHING I DID.
I TOOK OFF HIS SHIRT,

02:49.370 --> 02:51.138
HE TOOK OFF MY SHIRT.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.241
I TOLD HIM HE HAS
A FANTASTIC BODY,

02:53.341 --> 02:56.810
BECAUSE HE DOES, AND
HE GOES, "SO DO YOU."

02:58.078 --> 02:59.547
AT ONE POINT,
HE STROKES MY HAIR

02:59.647 --> 03:02.149
AND HE ASKS ME WHAT KIND
OF SHAMPOO I USE.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.151
( laughs )
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

03:04.252 --> 03:06.153
WE'RE LYING THERE,
FACE TO FACE,

03:06.254 --> 03:08.088
PETTING EACH OTHER
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.191
ANYWAY, I GET
SICK OF IT,

03:11.292 --> 03:14.728
SO I SAY TO MYSELF,
"MAYBE HE'S WAITING
FOR A SIGNAL."

03:14.828 --> 03:18.165
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE
WANTS ME TO LEAD.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.368
MAYBE IF I START
DOING SOMETHING, YOU KNOW,

03:20.468 --> 03:22.336
THINGS WILL FINALLY
GET MOVING.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.805
SO I WENT DOWN ON HIM.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.509
EVERYTHING
WAS SO PROPER.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.712
I DIDN'T WANT PROPER.
I JUST WANTED HIM TO FUCK,

03:31.812 --> 03:35.283
WITHOUT ALL THE BULLSHIT
ABOUT MY SHAMPOO AND
MY BEAUTIFUL BREASTS

03:35.383 --> 03:38.286
AND MY EXCELLENT TASTE
IN CURTAINS.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.693
SO DID THAT
MOVE THINGS ALONG?

03:45.793 --> 03:48.061
WHAT? THE BLOWJOB?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.830
MM-HMM..

03:49.930 --> 03:52.300
OF COURSE.

03:58.639 --> 04:01.509
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE DOESN'T LIKE SEX.

04:01.609 --> 04:04.077
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
HE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE IT.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.281
IT'S LIKE HE'S CARRYING
OUT AN ASSIGNMENT,

04:07.381 --> 04:09.383
A MISSION,
LIKE A PILOT.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.051
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE A-- LIKE A PILOT?

04:11.151 --> 04:13.321
YOU KNOW THOSE
AIR FORCE GUYS THAT
MARK TALLY POINTS

04:13.421 --> 04:14.955
ON THE WINGS
OF THEIR FIGHTER JET

04:15.055 --> 04:17.124
TO KEEP TRACK
OF HOW MANY PLANES
THEY'VE SHOT DOWN?

04:17.224 --> 04:20.428
IT WAS LIKE THAT,
LIKE HE WAS KEEPING SCORE.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.930
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T
EVEN TOUCH ME

04:23.030 --> 04:24.898
WHILE HE
WAS GOING AT IT.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.802
HE WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,
LEANING ON HIS ELBOWS

04:28.902 --> 04:32.272
AS IF HE DIDN'T WANT
ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN US...

04:32.373 --> 04:34.742
EXCEPT WHERE NECESSARY.

04:34.842 --> 04:38.145
AND I KEPT TRYING TO BRING
MY FACE CLOSER TO HIS

04:38.245 --> 04:40.381
TO KISS HIM
AND HE JUST...

04:40.481 --> 04:43.451
KEPT PULLING
HIS FACE AWAY...

04:44.352 --> 04:47.054
AS IF HE COULDN'T
STAND ME.

04:52.092 --> 04:54.562
AND THAT WAS IT.
IT WAS VERY FAST.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.964
TWO MINUTES, MORE OR LESS,
AND THEN HE CAME.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.800
AND THEN HE WENT STRAIGHT
TO THE BATHROOM AND I JUST
LAID THERE IN SHOCK.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.102
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T EVEN
ASK ME HOW IT WAS,

05:02.202 --> 05:04.572
IF I WAS OKAY OR NOT--
NOTHING.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.707
ANYWAY, I MADE
MYSELF COME.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.208
WHILE HE WAS
IN THE BATHROOM?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.444
NO, WHEN HE GOT BACK.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.713
I HAD TO.

05:12.813 --> 05:17.351
I MEAN, I HATE TO
BE LEFT HIGH AND DRY.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.721
HE WAS JUST LYING ON
HIS BACK, CONDUCTING
DIALOGUE WITH THE CEILING

05:20.821 --> 05:23.156
OR MAYBE WITH HIS WIFE,
OR MAYBE WITH YOU,

05:23.256 --> 05:25.559
AND HE LOOKED
SO FUCKING SEXY.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.662
SO I-- I CLIMBED
ON TOP OF HIS LEG.

05:28.762 --> 05:32.099
I THOUGHT HE'D GET
THE HINT AND HE'D
START SOMETHING--

05:32.199 --> 05:34.267
BUT NOTHING.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.237
SO I JUST
KEPT GOING...

05:37.337 --> 05:40.908
RIDING HIS THIGH.
IT FELT GOOD.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.716
AND THEN I WAS
OVERWHELMED WITH THIS
SADNESS FOR HIM.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.818
HE BROKE MY HEART,
THIS GUY.

05:50.918 --> 05:54.522
HE'S FRAGILE, REALLY.
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

05:57.791 --> 06:02.029
I DON'T THINK HE COULD
TELL WHAT I WAS THINKING.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.765
I WAS COMPLETELY IN
MY OWN HEAD, AND I WAS
THINKING TO MYSELF,

06:04.865 --> 06:10.638
"SHIT, THIS IS
GONNA BE THE SADDEST
ORGASM OF MY LIFE."

06:10.738 --> 06:14.241
HERE I AM RIDING THIS
HOT, SAD GUY'S THIGH.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.977
I WAS EXPECTING
SOMETHING PITIFUL
AND MEASLY, RIGHT?

06:17.077 --> 06:21.449
BUT NO. A VOLCANO IS
A CLICHE, BUT THAT'S
WHAT IT WAS.

06:21.549 --> 06:26.286
IT WAS LIKE 10 ORGASMS
EXPLODING AT ONCE.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.188
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE.

06:28.288 --> 06:32.826
BUT I SCREAMED--
I DID, I SCREAMED AND
I THINK I SCARED HIM.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.864
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
REALLY PROUD OF ME.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.900
WHY WOULD I HAVE
BEEN PROUD?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.969
I MEAN,
AS MY THERAPIST.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.405
YOU KNOW,
THAT I FINALLY...

06:45.506 --> 06:48.642
CONNECTED
WITH MYSELF.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.812
DOESN'T HAPPEN
VERY OFTEN.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.990
I'M SORRY.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.993
THAT WAS A BIT
REVEALING.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.662
BUT YOU MUST
BE USED TO IT.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.664
YOU KNOW, HEARING
CONFESSIONS LIKE THAT,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.733
IT PROBABLY DOESN'T
IMPRESS YOU ANYMORE.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.635
ACTUALLY, IT MAKES
A VERY BIG IMPRESSION.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.770
REALLY?
WHAT SORT OF IMPRESSION?

07:16.870 --> 07:18.305
WELL...

07:18.405 --> 07:20.373
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS,

07:20.474 --> 07:22.610
BUT ONE THING SEEMS
PERFECTLY PLAIN TO ME:

07:22.710 --> 07:25.078
YOU SLEPT
WITH MY PATIENT.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.548
EXCUSE ME?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.684
HE ISN'T YOUR ONLY PATIENT.
HE DOESN'T BELONG TO YOU.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.353
HE'S A GREAT GUY, OKAY?
A LITTLE FUCKED UP,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.188
A LITTLE INSECURE
IN BED, MAYBE,

07:35.288 --> 07:37.024
BUT HE'S GOT POTENTIAL.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.259
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE
A TERRIFIC AFFAIR WITH HIM.

07:39.359 --> 07:42.195
NEVERTHELESS, IT'S NO
COINCIDENCE THAT YOU
WENT TO BED WITH HIM

07:42.295 --> 07:45.833
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S
ANY COINCIDENCE THAT YOU
BEGAN YOUR AFFAIR WITH HIM

07:45.933 --> 07:49.803
SHORTLY AFTER WE TALKED
ABOUT YOUR QUITTING THERAPY.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.774
ARE YOU SAYING THAT I
DID THIS TO GET BACK AT YOU?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.344
REMEMBER THE GUY
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT--

07:57.444 --> 08:00.614
THE GUY THAT YOU MET AT
THE BAR, THAT YOU WENT TO
THE RESTROOM WITH?

08:00.714 --> 08:04.918
YOU SAID THAT YOU FELT
YOU WERE WITH ME.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.790
IT'S NOT
THE SAME THING, PAUL.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.825
ARE YOU SURE
IT ISN'T?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.894
IT WAS DURING
THAT SESSION, LAURA,
THAT YOU DECIDED

08:13.994 --> 08:16.864
TO TELL ME
THAT YOU WERE
IN LOVE WITH ME.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.733
AND THAT'S HOW
YOU CHOSE TO TELL ME
HOW YOU FELT ABOUT ME--

08:19.833 --> 08:21.769
BY HAVING SEX
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.204
PAUL, IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I PUT RIGHT OUT THERE,

08:24.304 --> 08:25.773
WITHOUT HINTING
OR MANIPULATION,

08:25.873 --> 08:28.475
IS THAT
I'VE WANTED YOU.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.411
SO I DON'T NEED TO FUCK
ANOTHER MAN

08:31.511 --> 08:33.513
JUST TO GET
MY MESSAGE ACROSS.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.655
WHAT MADE YOU SO...

08:41.755 --> 08:44.124
SAD ABOUT ALEX?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.028
HIS LONELINESS.
HE'S A SAD GUY.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.298
DID YOU FEEL SAD?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.300
NO, I FELT HORNY.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.969
SO SADNESS FOR HIM BUT
NO SADNESS FOR YOURSELF.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.305
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET AT HERE?

08:58.405 --> 09:01.108
MAYBE YOU DID
FEEL SADNESS...

09:01.208 --> 09:05.813
BECAUSE YOU WERE WITH
A MAN YOU DIDN'T REALLY
WANT TO BE WITH.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.549
ARE YOU SAYING THAT WHEN
I WAS FUCKING ALEX,

09:09.650 --> 09:11.318
- I WAS ACTUALLY FUCKING YOU?
- WERE YOU?

09:11.418 --> 09:14.121
- DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.
- WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
A COMPLIMENT, LAURA.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.324
I THINK IT SEEMS MORE LIKE,
"LOOK WHAT YOU MISSED
OUT ON, PAUL.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.761
YOU COWARD, YOU IDIOT."

09:28.969 --> 09:31.038
MMM.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.340
I'M TIRED.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.915
I'M REALLY SO TIRED.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.759
( sighs )

09:55.262 --> 09:59.299
SO, AFTER ALEX LEFT,

09:59.399 --> 10:02.035
I COULDN'T FALL ASLEEP.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.839
I SUDDENLY HAD
THIS INCREDIBLE CRAVING
FOR CHEESECAKE.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.909
( softly )
CHEESECAKE.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.444
YOU KNOW THOSE AMAZINGLY
FLUFFY CHEESECAKES

10:11.544 --> 10:14.581
WITH THAT
AMAZING SMELL?

10:14.682 --> 10:17.184
WELL, MY MOTHER
USED TO BAKE THOSE.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.721
EVERY FRIDAY AFTERNOON,
AFTER I FINISHED PLAYING
WITH MY FRIENDS,

10:20.821 --> 10:22.856
I USED TO COME HOME

10:22.956 --> 10:26.894
AND THAT SMELL--
IT WAS INTOXICATING.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.331
IT WAS LIKE A TRAIL
OF SCENT PAVING MY WAY HOME,

10:31.431 --> 10:33.901
LIKE A CARTOON CHARACTER.

10:36.503 --> 10:39.006
THEN MY MOTHER
GOT SICK.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.615
THE CANCER WAS ONLY
STAGE ONE AT THAT POINT

10:48.716 --> 10:50.751
WHEN THEY FOUND IT.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.353
BUT WHEN SHE STARTED CHEMO,
SHE STOPPED BAKING.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.588
YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS TIRED.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.525
SHE-- SHE HAD
NO ENERGY.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.427
AND THAT WAS
THE FIRST SIGN--

11:00.527 --> 11:04.297
THE FIRST SIGN THAT
SOMETHING REALLY BIG
WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.701
AND WHEN SHE WAS
REALLY SICK,

11:07.801 --> 11:10.637
I USED TO FIND MYSELF
ROAMING THE HALLS OF THE
APARTMENT BUILDING,

11:10.738 --> 11:12.672
CLIMBING UP AND DOWN
THE STAIRS,

11:12.773 --> 11:15.408
SEARCHING FOR THAT SMELL
OF CHEESECAKE.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.746
SHIT,
HOW CORNY IS THAT?

11:20.647 --> 11:24.184
AND ONCE I REMEMBER
A WOMAN COMING OUT
OF HER APARTMENT

11:24.284 --> 11:27.320
AND SHE-- THANK YOU.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.931
AND SHE SAW ME
STANDING OUT THERE--
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS.

11:39.933 --> 11:43.003
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
NEW TO THE BUILDING.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.906
AND SHE WAS
YELLING AT ME,

11:46.006 --> 11:47.875
"GO AWAY, GO ON,
GO HOME.

11:47.975 --> 11:51.378
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
STANDING OUT HERE, JUST..."

11:58.051 --> 12:01.021
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOU HAD THAT...

12:01.121 --> 12:04.291
PARTICULAR MEMORY
THE OTHER NIGHT?

12:04.391 --> 12:07.094
I DON'T KNOW.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.403
I SEARCHED THROUGH
MY WHOLE APARTMENT

12:16.503 --> 12:18.538
LOOKING FOR
A RECIPE BUT--

12:18.638 --> 12:20.240
NOT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE
DONE ANY GOOD.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.009
I MEAN, MY FRIDGE
IS COMPLETELY EMPTY.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.111
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
ABOUT GOING OUT
TO GET A PIECE,

12:24.211 --> 12:27.915
BUT IT WAS 3:00 A.M.,
SO I JUST GAVE UP
AND WENT TO SLEEP.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.517
ONLY THEN THE PHONE RANG
AND IT WAS ALEX,

12:30.617 --> 12:32.820
AND HE CALLED TO THANK ME

12:32.920 --> 12:34.788
AND TELL ME THAT HE HAD
AN AMAZING TIME WITH ME

12:34.888 --> 12:37.090
AND THAT HE
WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.259
GO FIGURE, HUH?

12:40.828 --> 12:43.163
HE'S SUPPOSED TO PICK ME
UP FROM HERE PRETTY SOON.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.397
FROM HERE?

12:44.497 --> 12:46.834
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
HE SAID.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.602
AREN'T YOU AFRAID THAT
ANDREW WILL FIND OUT ABOUT THIS?

12:49.702 --> 12:52.505
OR, MAYBE YOU
WANT TO GET CAUGHT.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.842
ANDREW AND I SPLIT UP.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.245
- WHAT?
- FOR GOOD.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.580
AND IT IS FOR GOOD.
HE'S A NICE GUY.

13:00.680 --> 13:04.017
HE'LL MAKE A NICE HUSBAND
FOR SOMEONE WHO DESERVES HIM.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.919
BUT OBVIOUSLY
NOT FOR YOU?

13:06.019 --> 13:08.455
WELL, I NEARLY FUCK GUYS
IN BATHROOM STALLS,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.390
AS YOU VERY KINDLY
REMINDED ME.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.526
AND I JUST COULDN'T
STAND UP THERE IN FRONT
OF EVERYONE

13:13.626 --> 13:14.895
AND PROMISE TO--

13:14.995 --> 13:18.665
WELL, I JUST SHOULDN'T
EVER MAKE PROMISES.

13:18.765 --> 13:22.936
HEY, I PROMISE NOT
TO MAKE ANY MORE PROMISES.
HOW'S THAT?

13:25.672 --> 13:29.042
SO I TOLD HIM
THAT-- "I'M SORRY, BUT
I CAN'T MARRY YOU.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.645
I AM INCAPABLE OF BEING
THE WOMAN YOU WANT,

13:32.745 --> 13:34.381
THE KIND OF WOMAN
YOU DESERVE."

13:34.481 --> 13:39.052
I PUT IT ALL ON ME.
WELL, 'CAUSE IT IS ALL ME.

13:39.152 --> 13:43.490
AND HE LOOKED AT ME AND
HE SAID, "THANK YOU, LAURA.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.525
THANK YOU.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.661
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

13:48.761 --> 13:52.765
GOD EXISTS.
IT'S A FACT.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.468
HE'S MADE ME REALIZE
WHO AND WHAT YOU ARE,

13:55.568 --> 13:59.106
AND HE'S SAVED ME FROM A LONG,
ENDLESS DEATH WITH YOU."

14:00.373 --> 14:01.841
FLATTERING, NO?

14:01.942 --> 14:04.144
HE MUST HAVE
BEEN DEVASTATED.
MAYBE HE FEELS--

14:04.244 --> 14:06.046
I DON'T CARE
HOW HE FEELS.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.048
YOU DON'T CARE
HOW HE FEELS?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.382
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW,
AND I REALLY DON'T FEEL

14:09.482 --> 14:11.118
LIKE TALKING ABOUT
ANDREW'S SIDE OF THE STORY.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.485
WHY DOES THAT MAKE YOU
SO UPSET?

14:12.585 --> 14:15.155
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE
IN THERAPY HERE, PAUL.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.191
ANDREW HAS HIS OWN THERAPIST.
SHE'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.127
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM,
WORRY ABOUT ME.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.962
I AM TAKING CARE
OF YOU, LAURA.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.730
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE KICKING ME
OUT OF THERAPY.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.432
I AM NOT KICKING YOU
OUT OF THERAPY.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.334
- I BROUGHT IT UP
AS AN OPTION.
- DON'T SUGARCOAT IT.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.469
YOU EVEN TRIED
TO BLAME IT ON ME.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.339
YOU MADE UP THE MOST
RIDICULOUS CASE AS TO
WHY I WAS LATE.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.574
IT WAS NASTY,
A BULLSHIT EXCUSE.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.977
INSTEAD OF LEVELING WITH ME
AND SAYING, "LISTEN, LAURA,

14:37.077 --> 14:40.113
I HAVE FEELINGS FOR
YOU TOO AND IT'S HARD
FOR ME TO DEAL WITH THAT."

14:40.213 --> 14:42.749
INSTEAD OF
FIGURING IT OUT SO WE
COULD CONTINUE THERAPY,

14:42.849 --> 14:44.384
- SO WE COULD--
- WHAT?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.219
SO THAT WE
COULD BE TOGETHER,
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.855
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR A YEAR, PAUL.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.191
A YEAR.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.061
THERE IS MORE INTIMACY
BETWEEN US

14:54.161 --> 14:57.530
THAN MOST COUPLES
IN THE WORLD.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

14:57.630 --> 14:59.632
LAURA, I DON'T DENY THAT
THERE'S A CERTAIN INTIMACY

14:59.732 --> 15:01.701
- THAT CAN DEVELOP BETWEEN--
- "A CERTAIN INTIMACY--

15:01.801 --> 15:04.637
INTIMACY-LIKE..."
CUT THE CRAP, PAUL.

15:04.737 --> 15:08.208
IS THERE INTIMACY HERE
OR NOT?

15:15.082 --> 15:18.518
YES.
THERE IS.

15:23.656 --> 15:27.560
AND NOW YOU'RE WILLING
TO THROW THAT ALL AWAY.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.796
AND WHY?
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED?

15:29.896 --> 15:32.132
- LAURA--
- I KNOW THAT AS A THERAPIST,

15:32.232 --> 15:35.902
YOU TELL YOURSELF THAT IT'S
PART OF THERAPY TO FIND OUT
WHY I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU

15:36.003 --> 15:38.038
AND HOW THAT'S LINKED
TO MY PAST AND ALL THAT.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.808
BUT ISN'T THAT ALWAYS
THE WAY IT WORKS, PAUL?

15:41.908 --> 15:45.712
DOESN'T OUR PAST
ALWAYS DETERMINE WHO
WE FALL IN LOVE WITH?

15:45.812 --> 15:48.515
SO WHAT IF YOU CAN TRACE IT
BACK TO THE WITHHOLDING MOTHER,

15:48.615 --> 15:51.418
THE NARCISSISTIC FATHER,
THE PARENT WHO'S
MISSING IN ACTION.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.886
DOES THAT MAKE OUR LOVE
ANY LESS REAL?

15:53.987 --> 15:56.256
BUT SOMETIMES
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE,
LET'S SAY,

15:56.356 --> 15:58.258
- LESS THAN IDEAL.
- I KNOW THAT.

15:58.358 --> 16:01.128
I KNOW YOU CAN DELUDE
YOURSELF INTO THINK--

16:01.228 --> 16:03.997
ONLY I AM NOT DELUDED.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.833
NOT ABOUT YOU, NOT ABOUT
HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU,

16:06.933 --> 16:09.269
WHY I FEEL IT.
THERE'S ALWAYS GOT TO BE
AN EXPLANATION,

16:09.369 --> 16:12.705
BUT THAT I FEEL IT
IS IRREFUTABLE.

16:17.444 --> 16:21.648
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO
CONVINCE YOU ANYMORE, PAUL.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.351
I MEAN, YOU THINK THAT I'VE
IMAGINED THIS FAIRY TALE,

16:24.451 --> 16:29.056
THIS HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER.
THAT I'VE IDEALIZED YOU.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.391
YOU THINK THIS IS A CASE
OF A MISERABLE PATIENT

16:31.491 --> 16:33.393
SITTING IN FRONT OF
HER-- HER THERAPIST

16:33.493 --> 16:36.163
IMAGINING THAT
YOU'RE MY SUPERMAN--

16:36.263 --> 16:38.265
PERFECT SAVIOR, MENTOR.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.167
I DON'T SEE YOU
THAT WAY AT ALL.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.302
HOW DO YOU
REALLY SEE ME?

16:42.402 --> 16:44.771
I SEE YOU
THE WAY YOU ARE...

16:46.106 --> 16:49.008
YOUR IMPERFECTIONS.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.612
YOU'RE NOT AT EASE
WITH YOUR BODY,

16:52.712 --> 16:56.083
WITH YOUR PROFESSION,
WITH WHO YOU'VE BECOME.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.852
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT YOUR LIFE,

16:59.952 --> 17:03.156
BUT I-- I IMAGINE
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY AT HOME.

17:03.256 --> 17:07.160
SOMETHING IN YOU IS--
IS RESTLESS, DAMAGED.

17:07.260 --> 17:11.731
THERE'S A YEARNING THERE,
AND I KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.567
AND I WANT YOU
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE--

17:14.667 --> 17:16.269
DAMAGED AND RESTLESS,

17:16.369 --> 17:19.806
YEARNING--
WARTS AND ALL.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.175
SO YOU CAN FIX ME?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.544
GOD, YOU CAN BE SUCH A FUCKING
PRICK WHEN YOU WANT TO BE.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.580
- YOU KNOW THAT?
- SO THAT I CAN FIX YOU THEN?

17:36.456 --> 17:40.193
YOU KNOW, NEXT MONTH
I'LL BE 30.

17:40.293 --> 17:43.163
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING
TO MYSELF,

17:43.263 --> 17:46.233
"I'VE HATED MYSELF
FOR 30 YEARS.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.472
IT'S ENOUGH.
I DON'T WANT TO ANYMORE."

17:53.273 --> 17:55.608
WHY DO YOU HATE YOURSELF?

17:55.708 --> 17:58.445
YOU'RE SURPRISED?

17:58.545 --> 18:00.580
I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU
SAY IT BEFORE.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.316
WELL, I GUESS YOU SAVE
THE BEST FOR LAST.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.318
THAT'S THE BEST, LAURA?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.620
THAT YOU HATE YOURSELF?

18:07.720 --> 18:10.357
I DON'T KNOW, PAUL.
I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE SURPRISED?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.425
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE REALIZE
ABOUT ME AFTER AN HOUR.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.727
I DIDN'T KNOW IT
AFTER AN HOUR. I DIDN'T
KNOW IT AFTER A YEAR.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.497
IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

18:18.965 --> 18:22.435
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY AND FIND
OUT WHY IT'S SO HARD FOR YOU.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.071
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SEE SOMEONE.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.207
YEAH.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.776
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.747
SERIOUSLY, I THINK THE REASON
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO HEAR IT

18:34.847 --> 18:39.018
IS BECAUSE I-- I KNOW THAT
YOU HAVE SO MANY REASONS

18:39.118 --> 18:41.288
TO-- TO LOVE YOURSELF,

18:41.388 --> 18:44.324
SO MANY THINGS TO BE--
TO BE REALLY PROUD OF,

18:44.424 --> 18:46.859
YET YOU CHOOSE
TO IGNORE THEM.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.328
WHY?

18:48.428 --> 18:51.564
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
HATED YOURSELF?

18:56.035 --> 18:57.304
YEAH.

18:57.404 --> 19:01.007
I GUESS I DID...
ONCE.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.043
I WAS A KID.
YOU KNOW?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.713
MY MOTHER,

19:06.813 --> 19:08.815
SHE WAS IN
PRETTY BAD SHAPE

19:08.915 --> 19:12.018
AND I TOOK CARE OF HER,

19:12.118 --> 19:15.655
BUT...

19:15.755 --> 19:18.124
AHEM, I COULDN'T--

19:18.225 --> 19:19.992
I COULDN'T SAVE HER...

19:20.092 --> 19:22.595
FROM HERSELF, YOU KNOW?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.063
( sighs )

19:24.163 --> 19:27.033
I GUESS I HATED
MYSELF FOR THAT.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.669
WAS SHE SICK?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.675
SHE WAS IN A DIFFICULT
EMOTIONAL STATE.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.944
I THOUGHT THAT I COULD
PULL HER OUT OF IT.

19:38.044 --> 19:42.282
I-- I USED TO COOK HER
ALL THESE, YOU KNOW,
ELABORATE MEALS.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.617
BUT SHE WOULDN'T
EAT THEM.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.486
COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY.
LIKE EVERY KID,

19:46.586 --> 19:48.288
I THOUGHT IT WAS
MY FAULT.

19:48.388 --> 19:51.424
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT
I WASN'T DOING.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.826
MAYBE I COULD
DO SOMETHING ELSE.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.728
BUT YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.398
I KNOW THAT NOW, YES.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.536
HAVE YOU
FORGIVEN YOURSELF?

20:03.636 --> 20:04.904
I THINK SO.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.973
TOOK A LONG TIME.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.412
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.084
I MEAN REALLY.
I'M CURIOUS.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.852
IT FEELS LIKE
A RELIEF

20:19.952 --> 20:21.421
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH,

20:21.521 --> 20:24.156
TO KNOW THAT
THAT BURDEN IS GONE--

20:24.257 --> 20:26.559
THE BURDEN OF BLAME.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.696
AND TO KNOW DEEP DOWN

20:29.796 --> 20:34.467
THAT IT NEVER BELONGED THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.072
HMM.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.075
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU BECAME A PSYCHOLOGIST--

20:43.175 --> 20:45.945
TO HELP OTHERS
WITH THEIR BURDENS.

20:48.981 --> 20:51.551
YEAH, MAYBE.

20:51.651 --> 20:55.455
SO YOU'RE A PRODUCT
OF YOUR PAST TOO.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.532
WILL THAT BE CASH
OR CHECK?

21:05.632 --> 21:08.701
- CAN I OWE YOU THAT?
- SURE.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.202
( chuckles )

21:10.303 --> 21:13.740
ANYWAY, I KNOW
WHERE YOU LIVE.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.609
YES, YOU DO.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.458
( sighs )

21:33.192 --> 21:34.461
I SHOULD GET GOING.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.763
ALEX IS WAITING FOR ME.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.843
OKAY.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.645
OKAY.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.919
( knocks )

22:01.754 --> 22:03.623
I FORGOT,
I HAVEN'T PAID YOU.

22:03.723 --> 22:05.625
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
IT'LL DO NEXT WEEK.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.027
- THANKS.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.829
- BYE.
- BYE.

22:56.643 --> 22:59.145
( theme music playing )
