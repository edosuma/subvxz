WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:05.421
-You can tell me anything, Gypsy.
-I'm trapped.

00:05.753 --> 00:07.124
My mama used to say,

00:07.290 --> 00:10.489
"Sometimes the only way out
of the fire is through."

00:10.655 --> 00:14.602
I never once disrespected my mama
the way you do nearly every day!

00:14.768 --> 00:17.510
I prided myself
on being a good daughter!

00:17.884 --> 00:21.249
Look what Ruby's
wicked stepmom did to her neck.

00:21.415 --> 00:26.484
You can't show Victor stuff like that.
He might lose control.

00:27.315 --> 00:30.555
Would you actually...
be able to hurt a person like that?

00:30.721 --> 00:33.796
Like, the good side of me
would never do anything like that,

00:33.962 --> 00:39.113
but don't ask Victor unless you actually
mean it, because he might just do it.

00:39.279 --> 00:42.312
She's never gonna let us be together.
She said so.

00:42.811 --> 00:49.998
Victor, will you please...
kill my mother for me?

01:07.987 --> 01:10.604
Gypsy...

01:10.770 --> 01:13.055
Who's there?

01:13.845 --> 01:16.420
Help!

01:16.587 --> 01:19.536
Help!
Help me!

01:19.702 --> 01:22.154
Help!

01:24.106 --> 01:27.430
Gypsy! Somebody!

01:31.875 --> 01:35.032
Good. Good, Dee Dee. Another push.
Here we go, and push.

01:35.199 --> 01:38.065
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

01:39.519 --> 01:42.801
One more, here we go.
Push, push, push, push.

01:42.967 --> 01:46.457
Seven, eight, nine, ten.
Good job.

01:46.623 --> 01:48.950
-I need more drugs.
-You're doing okay, Dee Dee.

01:49.116 --> 01:50.570
You don't anything else, you got this.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.312
I think we've got
a nuchal cord situation.

01:53.478 --> 01:54.849
What is that? Tell me what...

01:55.015 --> 01:57.550
The umbilical cord might
be tied around baby's neck.

01:57.716 --> 02:00.541
But it happens all the time. We just
need to get her out to fix it, okay?

02:00.707 --> 02:03.033
We're crowning. I need a big push.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.612
-Here we go.
-And one, two, three...

02:04.778 --> 02:08.434
-Push, push, push.
-Seven, eight, nine, ten.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.304
-Good, we got a baby.
-We got a baby.

02:10.470 --> 02:13.378
-We got a baby.
-Good work, Dee Dee.

02:14.292 --> 02:16.992
-Why isn't it crying?
-She's just transitioning.

02:17.159 --> 02:21.812
The doctor's got it all under control.
She's gonna be fine. Just breathe.

02:21.978 --> 02:23.473
You did a great job.

02:25.758 --> 02:29.788
We have a beautiful, healthy girl.

02:31.782 --> 02:33.153
Well done.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.061
Yeah, she's so beautiful.

02:36.228 --> 02:37.889
Say hello.

02:38.056 --> 02:40.548
-Got her?
-Yeah.

02:40.714 --> 02:42.376
Oh...

02:42.542 --> 02:46.198
-Do you know her name?
-Oh, yes.

02:46.364 --> 02:50.810
She's Gypsy. Gypsy Rose.

02:51.724 --> 02:55.089
Oh...

02:55.255 --> 02:56.626
Yes.

03:02.608 --> 03:07.303
-And what's her father's name?
-I...

03:07.677 --> 03:09.297
I'll send you home
with some paternity papers

03:09.463 --> 03:13.659
for if you want to add him
to the records later.

03:13.825 --> 03:18.021
I'll go get some stuff for baby.
I'll be right back, okay?

03:18.188 --> 03:23.339
Oh, Gypsy.
Oh, Gypsy Rose.

03:23.505 --> 03:30.651
You are an angel from heaven.

03:30.817 --> 03:32.271
Oh...

03:36.717 --> 03:41.079
-Oh, Mama.
-Look at her.

03:46.438 --> 03:48.640
-Hello.
-Oh, Gypsy Rose.

03:48.806 --> 03:52.877
-Oh, this is your grandmama.
-Hey, little girl.

03:53.044 --> 03:56.824
Oh... Oh, no, no, no.

03:56.990 --> 04:01.436
Oh, give her here.
Give her here. Yeah.

04:01.602 --> 04:04.178
Hi, there.
I'm Debbie. And you are?

04:04.344 --> 04:07.709
I am Grandmama, who knows best.

04:09.412 --> 04:11.946
We should get her measured
and then probably feed her.

04:12.113 --> 04:17.098
Dee Dee probably hasn't asked about
that. I apologize, it's her first time.

04:17.846 --> 04:21.045
And what about sponge?
She still got stuff all over her.

04:21.211 --> 04:23.371
I feel like you've
done this a few times.

04:24.327 --> 04:27.110
I still want to give her her first bath.

04:27.276 --> 04:31.555
No, no, no, no, that...
that's much later for you.

04:31.722 --> 04:34.256
Okay, come on, girl.
Come on.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.790
Yeah, let's get you measured.

04:36.956 --> 04:39.490
Ooh, I wonder how much you weigh.

04:39.657 --> 04:41.485
Come on, girl, I got you.

05:08.572 --> 05:10.607
-Where to?
-Just hold your horses for a minute.

05:10.981 --> 05:13.806
Meter's running. I got all night.

06:13.464 --> 06:17.577
Um, Best Sleep Inn, please.

06:17.743 --> 06:19.322
Um, we're kind of in a hurry.

06:19.488 --> 06:22.729
Slow down, hurry up,
I can do whatever you want, honey.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.032
Oh.

07:44.987 --> 07:48.975
Uh, Victor didn't have time
to clean up last night.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.961
Okay.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.733
-Do you want one, darling?
-Um, no.

08:14.899 --> 08:19.137
I pretty much only take
my men's vitamins.

09:23.531 --> 09:28.973
Candy loves what you've done
with the place.

09:32.255 --> 09:33.792
Well, I love Candy.

09:38.487 --> 09:42.101
Whoop!

09:44.179 --> 09:48.582
He's eating brownies,
but soon he'll be eating me.

09:51.532 --> 09:55.811
Mm...

09:57.556 --> 10:02.209
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:14.589 --> 10:18.411
Oh, stop!

10:27.884 --> 10:31.581
Well, that's... not so fast.
Not so fast like that.

10:31.747 --> 10:38.768
Maybe... maybe slow down just...
Let's just do it the normal way.

10:38.934 --> 10:42.009
Come here, come...

10:43.546 --> 10:45.748
Oh!

11:02.573 --> 11:04.401
No, no!

11:09.304 --> 11:13.583
I'm so excited to see where you live.

11:13.957 --> 11:16.823
What should I wear
to impress your mom and Vance?

11:16.989 --> 11:22.265
Um... my mom likes purple things.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.758
You didn't say that
when I was packing.

11:24.924 --> 11:28.040
Well, she... she likes
different colors too.

11:28.206 --> 11:30.325
Okay.

11:30.491 --> 11:35.851
-Tell me more about Wisconsin.
-Pretty cool, I guess.

11:36.017 --> 11:40.337
Yeah? Cool, how? Like... like, are the
people really nice?

11:40.504 --> 11:46.777
-Are there lots of meadows and...
-My boss Brian is pretty nice.

11:48.439 --> 11:53.133
-Anything else?
-Nope, not really.

12:06.054 --> 12:08.754
Hey.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.493
Please eat.
Damn it.

12:14.113 --> 12:16.481
Oh, she won't eat!

12:16.897 --> 12:19.223
I'm so afraid there's
something wrong with her!

12:19.389 --> 12:24.873
Your agitation is making her agitated.
Not to mention keeping her awake.

12:25.039 --> 12:26.950
I know something's wrong!

12:27.117 --> 12:28.737
Give her here.

12:28.903 --> 12:30.523
Go on to bed.

12:33.764 --> 12:35.716
Shh.

12:35.883 --> 12:40.951
Oh, you got
your daddy's eyes, possum.

12:42.987 --> 12:47.224
But you don't need him, do you?
'Cause you got your grandma, huh?

12:47.390 --> 12:49.551
-Okay, okay, give her back.
-You got your grandma.

12:49.717 --> 12:52.583
Come on, come on.
Give her back.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.616
Oh...

13:00.352 --> 13:07.083
We're gonna go on a little trip together
to the doctor, just you and me.

13:09.866 --> 13:13.273
Shh.
Oh...

13:15.724 --> 13:20.792
I'm getting seasick, all this back and
forth, back and forth.

13:20.958 --> 13:22.496
Dee Dee.

13:22.953 --> 13:25.279
Why don't you just sit down?

13:30.929 --> 13:34.668
Doctor's gonna say she's just fine.

13:39.570 --> 13:45.304
-Hey, Ms. Blanchard, you wanna come in?
-Oh, thank you.

13:45.470 --> 13:47.713
Oh, everybody's coming in.

13:48.170 --> 13:50.414
Well, the headline
is nothing too concerning,

13:50.580 --> 13:52.989
but she does have what we call
"failure to thrive."

13:53.156 --> 13:54.817
Oh, my Lord! What?

13:54.983 --> 13:56.728
-Oh, that doesn't sound good.
-Lord!

13:56.895 --> 13:59.470
That's a creepy name, right?
But it's not too bad.

13:59.636 --> 14:01.132
Basically it just means
she's underweight

14:01.298 --> 14:03.043
and she's smaller than
she should be at two months.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.536
I just don't know I'm doing
all of this so wrong.

14:05.702 --> 14:08.610
You're not. Infants grow out of it
most of the time,

14:08.776 --> 14:10.770
especially if the parents
get a system in place.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.598
Well, you tell us what to do.
Let us know exactly

14:12.765 --> 14:17.334
-and I'll make sure it happens.
-Here's everything you need to know.

14:17.501 --> 14:20.160
Uh, there's a list in there of the
things that the mother can do.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.317
Like, it's important to feed her more,
e-even through the night.

14:23.483 --> 14:25.186
And I'll send a supplement with her,

14:25.353 --> 14:27.804
and you check her weight,
make sure she's gaining enough.

14:27.970 --> 14:29.964
Dee Dee can't ever give her
enough milk at a time.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.501
-That's not true!
-Yes, it is.

14:31.667 --> 14:34.035
Sometimes I try and you
tell me not to wake her.

14:34.202 --> 14:35.614
-That's not so.
-No worries.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.151
I will send home
a high-calorie formula

14:37.317 --> 14:39.935
that you can try
between breastfeedings.

14:40.101 --> 14:45.502
You can rest easy, mama.
You got this, right?

14:45.668 --> 14:48.742
Okay, then I will see you
back here next month.

14:48.908 --> 14:53.935
-Oh, thank you so much.
-You're gonna be great.

14:56.220 --> 14:57.591
Mollie, that is not nice!

14:57.757 --> 15:00.998
All I'm saying is that Mollie
was puny as a twig

15:01.164 --> 15:04.446
and all it took was my own two tits,
a breast pump, and a crap ton of time

15:04.612 --> 15:05.983
sitting there being milked
like a mama cow.

15:06.149 --> 15:08.060
Not everybody's like you, Janet.
Everybody's not like you.

15:08.227 --> 15:11.135
-Don't even use a fancy doctor...
-Yeah, and not everybody needs

15:11.301 --> 15:13.337
to put their two cents in,
is all I'm saying.

15:13.503 --> 15:15.372
-Do you hear me?
-Dee.

15:15.538 --> 15:17.117
-Dee?
-Uh-huh.

15:17.283 --> 15:20.482
I got 20 minutes to nap time.
What were you saying?

15:20.648 --> 15:22.227
Well, I don't know where I lost you.
You want me to start over?

15:23.806 --> 15:25.675
No, no, Janet.
Go on outside with those girls.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.794
-Go outside with the girls.
-Yeah, we're going.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.581
-[Please give us some peace.
-Okay, girls, you ready?

15:29.747 --> 15:31.118
Trampoline. Ready, set, go!

15:32.364 --> 15:36.062
Who's gonna beat me, who's gonna
beat me, who's gonna beat me?

15:39.593 --> 15:44.163
Ugh, you need to go to bed now too.
You look a mess.

15:44.329 --> 15:47.611
-I'll take this bottle and put her down.
-No, no, no, I'll give it to her.

15:47.777 --> 15:50.394
Doctor's orders.

15:52.305 --> 15:54.881
All right.

15:55.047 --> 15:57.623
All right.

15:57.789 --> 15:59.368
Oh...

16:01.196 --> 16:06.638
-Alone, mama. Give us some peace.
-Well, I'm not gonna go outside

16:06.805 --> 16:09.339
with your cousin Janet
and those hellions.

16:09.505 --> 16:14.116
I get a stress headache
every time they come by.

16:18.105 --> 16:22.051
Oh... Oh, there.

16:22.218 --> 16:25.749
You see that, Gypsy girl?

16:25.915 --> 16:28.740
Just the two of us.

16:28.906 --> 16:31.524
Like it ought to be.

16:39.251 --> 16:40.746
Checking out already?

16:40.913 --> 16:42.284
She actually needs
to meet my mom pretty soon

16:42.450 --> 16:45.566
since the wedding is coming up,
so we need to catch a bus.

16:45.732 --> 16:47.269
Except we're gonna
grab breakfast first.

16:47.435 --> 16:49.429
We've got continental till 9:00.

16:49.595 --> 16:51.631
Um, I'm gonna take her
to someplace fancier.

16:51.797 --> 16:54.705
-No offense.
-Yeah, it's our first real date.

16:54.872 --> 16:56.575
-Are you ready?
-Yep.

16:56.741 --> 17:00.979
-Bye, thank you.
-Bye.

17:02.641 --> 17:06.670
All-Star special, chocolate chip
waffles. Anything else?

17:06.837 --> 17:09.079
Um, yeah, could I have
a different drink, please?

17:09.246 --> 17:11.905
Sure. Orange juice,
chocolate milk, hot tea...

17:12.070 --> 17:15.395
Oh, um, what kind
of pop do you have?

17:15.560 --> 17:19.050
I have lots of tables.
Do you wanna look at a menu?

17:22.165 --> 17:26.694
N-no, um...
I'll just have orange juice.

17:40.778 --> 17:45.847
-Nick... Nick?
-Don't... don't worry.

17:46.013 --> 17:50.749
We're just here on a date. Just be
smiley and I'll do the talking.

17:50.915 --> 17:56.192
-It's okay.
-Oh, God. Oh, no.

18:00.512 --> 18:05.124
No, no, no, no...
We still have it.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.284
The knife, we still have it.

18:07.450 --> 18:09.486
Oh.

18:13.890 --> 18:17.961
-We're just like Bonnie and Clyde.
-What? Who?

18:18.584 --> 18:23.112
It's this couple who are criminals on
the run. They're pretty famous.

18:23.279 --> 18:25.480
We're not criminals.
We're not criminals.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.849
I know, I know.

18:31.961 --> 18:34.496
"Claudinea Blanchard?"

18:36.656 --> 18:41.766
Yes, that's me.
I, um... I must have dropped it.

18:44.092 --> 18:47.416
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-Have a nice day, Claudinea.

18:47.582 --> 18:49.244
You, too.

18:49.410 --> 18:51.737
-Oh, my gosh, can we please go?
-Yep.

18:51.903 --> 18:54.312
Can we go, please?

18:58.924 --> 19:03.286
Um... does the bus station
have metal detectors?

19:03.452 --> 19:06.070
-I guess.
-So we can't take the knife with us.

19:06.236 --> 19:09.559
Oh, there's a lake by my house, we can
throw it in when we get there.

19:09.725 --> 19:13.007
Nick, we can't keep it that long.
Let's find a post office

19:13.174 --> 19:17.993
and just mail it to ourselves, okay?
If we mail, it, it'll be safe.

19:18.159 --> 19:20.112
That's good thinking.

19:26.219 --> 19:29.335
Hey.
Hey.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.744
Baby? Baby?

19:32.326 --> 19:34.320
Yeah, you're mama's baby.

19:34.486 --> 19:36.148
-Baby?
-Baby.

19:36.314 --> 19:40.427
-Baby? Baby?
-Now show me, where's your cranium?

19:40.593 --> 19:44.374
-Can you say "cranium"?
-Christ on a cracker, Dee Dee.

19:44.540 --> 19:45.911
She's two.

19:46.077 --> 19:49.151
When I was her age my mama
let us just figure it out.

19:49.317 --> 19:52.932
I mean, you know, not your mom. 'Cause
she was always so worried about you.

19:53.098 --> 19:55.217
Probably because you're the baby, right?

19:55.383 --> 19:58.125
Dee Dee?

19:58.291 --> 20:00.659
-Baby?
-Are you listening?

20:00.825 --> 20:02.612
-Baby?
-Hey, Dee Dee,

20:02.778 --> 20:04.814
where'd you get that camera?

20:07.556 --> 20:09.134
-Say "baby."
-Who knocks on someone's door

20:09.300 --> 20:11.752
this time of night?
Hmm, you got a hot date?

20:11.918 --> 20:13.746
Baby.

20:13.912 --> 20:16.363
-We're here for Ms. Dee Dee Blanchard.
-Hi, baby.

20:16.529 --> 20:18.731
Dee. Dee Dee.

20:21.431 --> 20:24.755
-Yeah.
-Come on in.

20:24.921 --> 20:30.073
They... there must be some kind
of misunderstanding, Clauddine.

20:30.987 --> 20:34.144
-We need to take you in, Ms. Blanchard.
-What are you... what did you do?

20:34.310 --> 20:36.803
County attorney's charging you
with felony check fraud.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.839
Oh, my Lord.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.957
Well, I might have written a bad check
without knowing,

20:41.124 --> 20:42.619
but I can clear this up.

20:42.785 --> 20:45.943
Bad check from your grandpa's checkbook?
He's pressing charges.

20:46.109 --> 20:48.394
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back, please.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.097
-No!
-We have to do this

20:50.263 --> 20:54.210
whether you cooperate or not.
Turn around.

20:54.376 --> 20:56.412
Oh, no!
Don't bring her in here!

20:56.578 --> 20:58.739
Leave her back there!
I don't want her to see this!

20:58.905 --> 21:02.145
She's scared!
Can't you see that she's scared?

21:02.311 --> 21:03.765
-Turn her away!
-Anything you say can

21:03.932 --> 21:05.676
and will be used against you...
-Turn her away!

21:05.843 --> 21:09.831
You shouldn't have done this
if you didn't want her to see it!

21:09.997 --> 21:13.736
One will be appointed to you.

21:13.902 --> 21:17.018
So with all these factors plus your
criminal record, I have no choice

21:17.184 --> 21:18.763
but to give you six months in jail,

21:18.929 --> 21:22.585
60 days credit for time served,
plus full restitution.

21:25.826 --> 21:28.152
That didn't work out the way
you thought it would, did it?

21:28.318 --> 21:30.853
Taking the baby to court thinking
the judge would take pity on you.

21:31.019 --> 21:33.968
She saw right through you.

21:38.206 --> 21:40.117
Oh, please, can I say goodbye?

21:40.283 --> 21:43.233
Come on, you can't
hug her with those things on.

21:44.022 --> 21:46.432
I know you could have
gotten together

21:46.598 --> 21:50.046
the money for the bond,
I just know you could have.

21:50.212 --> 21:52.871
Sometimes the only way out
is through.

21:53.037 --> 21:54.450
-Time to go.
-Oh...

21:54.616 --> 21:58.397
Please... Wait, you're the only other
one who knows her routine.

21:58.563 --> 22:02.260
Please check the list every day and keep
the schedule till I get back.

22:02.426 --> 22:06.622
Yes, yes, this little girl and I are
gonna have a grand old time.

22:06.789 --> 22:12.729
Well, just... just tell me that you'll
follow the list like the doctor asked.

22:12.896 --> 22:16.302
Exactly what he wrote.
Oh, promise me!

22:16.469 --> 22:19.917
-Give me your word!
-Yes.

22:20.083 --> 22:24.570
-Okay, sure.
-Gypsy! Oh, baby.

22:24.736 --> 22:28.600
It's okay, I'll be back soon.

22:36.535 --> 22:38.446
There's just the one
ticket on this reservation.

22:38.612 --> 22:41.935
"Nick Godejon, round-trip,
Big Bend to Springfield."

22:42.102 --> 22:45.799
Well, could you check
under "Gypsy Blanchard"?

22:50.203 --> 22:52.322
Nothing.

22:52.488 --> 22:55.977
I thought I checked it
before I hit the button.

22:59.052 --> 23:02.998
Can I just buy, um, a seat
on this bus, please?

23:03.996 --> 23:07.402
Unfortunately, it's chock full.
The first seat I have on this route

23:07.568 --> 23:12.471
-is two days from now.
-I-I thought I had checked it.

23:12.637 --> 23:15.753
-I-I remember...
-Can we just get two one-ways

23:15.919 --> 23:18.495
for the next bus?

23:18.661 --> 23:23.937
Okay. $104 economy per person.
$131 economy-extra.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.385
I don't... I don't care,
just get us out of here.

23:28.756 --> 23:31.789
Whatever the cheapest one is.

23:46.496 --> 23:48.157
Oh, oh.

23:48.324 --> 23:49.861
Hello?

23:50.027 --> 23:51.481
For Gypsy.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.846
Of course it is.

23:57.463 --> 24:01.119
Sorry, I got nothing for you today.

24:15.577 --> 24:18.360
Happy graduation!

24:19.191 --> 24:21.476
-Oh...
-How are you doing?

24:21.642 --> 24:23.013
-Oh...
-Huh?

24:24.384 --> 24:26.212
-How you doing?
-Oh...

24:26.379 --> 24:28.373
I don't wanna think about it.

24:28.539 --> 24:30.990
-Uh, let's pretend that never happened.
-Okay.

24:31.156 --> 24:32.569
Well, everybody's
waiting for you at home.

24:32.735 --> 24:37.637
-I can't wait to see Gypsy.
-She got so big.

24:42.041 --> 24:44.201
The wagon?

24:46.071 --> 24:47.816
Uh-oh, hey!

24:47.982 --> 24:50.973
-Yeah, girl, look at you!
-That's good.

24:51.139 --> 24:53.590
Look at how smart that girl is!

24:53.756 --> 24:56.291
Thank you so much.
You wanna go get that wagon

24:56.457 --> 24:59.448
and we'll put these
other buckets in there?

24:59.947 --> 25:03.893
Get the wagon.
Would you give me a Cheeto?

25:07.217 --> 25:08.712
I want one too.

25:08.879 --> 25:12.992
Here, you want mine?
You want mine?

25:15.110 --> 25:18.351
Oh...
Oh, girl, you're so big now.

25:18.891 --> 25:22.796
-It's okay, sugar.
-What is wrong with her?

25:22.962 --> 25:26.535
Honeybee, she just needs time
to remember you.

25:27.200 --> 25:32.684
What is she even doing out here?
It's her nap time. She could get sick.

25:32.850 --> 25:38.957
Don't I even get a "thank you"?
How about a smile?

25:39.123 --> 25:45.355
Smile for me, Dee Dee.
Come on, now, smile.

25:45.521 --> 25:46.934
She's dirty.

25:47.100 --> 25:52.542
I been here for six months taking care
of her. We do things different now.

25:52.708 --> 25:55.201
She's happy.

26:16.472 --> 26:19.837
Oh, something's wrong.
I think she's getting a fever.

26:20.003 --> 26:24.531
She's fine. She's sick a little bit,
but I fixed her.

26:24.698 --> 26:26.152
She's been good since you left.

26:26.318 --> 26:29.683
-I didn't leave.
-Well, call it what you want.

26:29.849 --> 26:33.754
I was trying to be polite.
You want me to call you a thief?

26:33.920 --> 26:36.039
I'll call you a thief.

26:37.493 --> 26:42.271
Well, I learned from the best.

26:42.437 --> 26:48.752
Just let her be.
Let her be.

26:51.161 --> 26:57.476
She's fine, Dee Dee.
You gave her cough syrup an hour ago.

27:02.836 --> 27:07.779
-99. Normal.
-You can see that she's sick!

27:07.946 --> 27:09.441
What are you trying to do?

27:09.607 --> 27:11.685
Prove that you're
a better mother than me?

27:11.851 --> 27:15.631
With all your gripes about me, you
couldn't keep one tiny little promise.

27:15.797 --> 27:19.121
To follow the list
that the doctor gave us.

27:19.869 --> 27:23.400
Oh...

27:24.854 --> 27:28.842
When the cops came, I could have told
them you weren't here.

27:29.009 --> 27:34.783
But you needed to learn your lesson.

27:36.154 --> 27:43.217
I knew she's better off with me from
the day... she... was born.

27:56.387 --> 27:59.585
Don't worry about her.

28:05.277 --> 28:11.883
I know you don't feel well.
But mama's here.

28:15.414 --> 28:17.242
She's here...

28:17.408 --> 28:20.316
I know.

28:26.340 --> 28:30.495
Here we go, it's coming.

28:30.661 --> 28:33.403
Just a little more for good measure.

28:33.569 --> 28:35.605
Shh.

28:39.344 --> 28:42.169
There we go.

28:42.335 --> 28:43.830
Mm-hmm.

28:48.650 --> 28:51.350
I think basically I had the tickets
right, but then I messed them up.

28:51.516 --> 28:53.718
-It doesn't matter.
-Well, look who's here.

28:53.884 --> 28:56.460
-Welcome back.
-We need to check back in.

28:56.626 --> 28:59.701
-The same room is fine.
-Oh, okay. Um, hmm.

29:01.279 --> 29:04.104
Well, I can't give you the same room.
Somebody else is in it.

29:04.270 --> 29:10.668
Uh, this one's smaller. Two twin beds.
You could push them together.

29:11.541 --> 29:15.404
-Okay.
-Okay, um...

29:17.689 --> 29:21.013
Thank you.

29:46.978 --> 29:49.928
Your goddamn music!

29:58.611 --> 30:01.145
It's about this guy
who's, um, a cop,

30:01.311 --> 30:03.887
but he's also this
really old dragon as well.

30:04.053 --> 30:09.620
-He's, like, thousands of years old.
-Let me go!

30:09.786 --> 30:12.071
I have to be with him!

30:12.237 --> 30:15.021
No!
Robert!

30:31.763 --> 30:34.672
We should get ready
for bed now so that...

30:34.838 --> 30:37.413
the morning will come faster.

30:39.158 --> 30:41.360
-Okay.
-Do you want one of these for sleeping?

30:41.526 --> 30:43.894
No. No, thank you.

30:44.061 --> 30:45.473
We're supposed to do
everything together,

30:45.639 --> 30:47.841
like Cinderella and...
and Prince Charming.

30:48.007 --> 30:54.654
I already told you, I don't want one.
I don't like drugs.

30:54.821 --> 30:56.192
Fine.

31:02.922 --> 31:06.453
I'm pretty hungry.
I'm gonna go to the vending machine.

31:06.744 --> 31:08.613
Okay.

31:15.925 --> 31:19.498
Ooh, now we're ready
for the whole week, Gyps.

31:19.664 --> 31:21.866
Dee Dee!

31:24.567 --> 31:26.768
Play time, girlies.

31:27.142 --> 31:31.671
Dee Dee, I'm stuck!

31:31.837 --> 31:34.330
Dolly says she wants jump
on the trampoline.

31:34.496 --> 31:38.276
Oh, but you and Dolly are never gonna
jump on that trampoline.

31:38.443 --> 31:41.101
'Cause that's how
noggins get broken.

31:41.268 --> 31:44.716
Dee Dee, I need you, girl!

31:46.585 --> 31:48.164
Dee Dee!

31:48.330 --> 31:51.072
Oh, you got a little
caught up, there.

31:51.238 --> 31:55.227
A mama shouldn't have to holler
for help. It's undignified.

31:55.393 --> 31:56.847
Just get me to bed.

31:58.176 --> 32:03.411
Oh, God Almighty! You almost threw me
out of the chair!

32:06.610 --> 32:08.978
-Oh...
-Not so fast.

32:09.809 --> 32:12.841
I was just getting
all your pills together.

32:13.008 --> 32:14.628
Oh, no, you weren't.

32:14.794 --> 32:19.862
You make such a racket with those pills,
I'd have heard you.

32:22.314 --> 32:26.593
-Come on.
-There we go.

32:26.759 --> 32:29.958
-Okay, come on.
-You a good girl, Dee Dee.

32:30.124 --> 32:32.575
-Mm.
-You a good girl.

32:32.907 --> 32:37.270
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Here you go.

32:37.436 --> 32:38.890
Ah, it's this leg.

32:39.056 --> 32:43.211
Get... get this leg. -Okay.

32:43.377 --> 32:45.122
Oh, Lord.

32:46.783 --> 32:49.775
Wore me out.

32:50.730 --> 32:54.885
Oh... you're looking peaked.

32:55.051 --> 32:56.920
No shit.

32:59.205 --> 33:03.941
I think I should call Patrick.

33:04.107 --> 33:06.642
No hospice.

33:06.808 --> 33:08.511
No.

33:08.677 --> 33:13.455
Just get me Percocet and...
and an Ensure.

33:13.621 --> 33:17.194
They're here already, Mama.

33:31.278 --> 33:33.978
Where's my Ensure?

33:34.144 --> 33:37.468
We're all out of Ensure.

33:41.747 --> 33:46.026
Sometimes the only way out
is through.

34:13.777 --> 34:16.976
Dee Dee?

34:17.143 --> 34:20.550
Dee Dee, I need you.

34:20.716 --> 34:23.665
I do need you.

34:32.929 --> 34:35.589
Hop up, Gyps.

34:38.663 --> 34:40.864
Yeah.

34:56.152 --> 34:59.560
Well, I guess I'd better
teach you to walk first.

34:59.726 --> 35:03.631
First you lift one foot, then you put it
down in front of you.

35:03.798 --> 35:06.124
Then you lift the other.

35:08.367 --> 35:11.317
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

35:12.439 --> 35:16.469
Has she been taking anything
for pain outside of the IV?

35:16.635 --> 35:21.163
-Not that I know of. Something wrong?
-It's her tolerance.

35:21.745 --> 35:25.858
The morphine, it doesn't seem to be
enough anymore. I-I don't get it.

35:26.024 --> 35:27.935
Her system is shutting down,

35:28.558 --> 35:32.214
and I'm guessing she's got
a few days, most.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.452
Oh... I wish there was more
I could do for her.

35:37.698 --> 35:43.057
You are, you're taking care of Emma and
Gypsy. You're a saint, Dee Dee.

35:44.304 --> 35:48.001
-Oh, thank you.
-You let me know if you need anything.

35:48.167 --> 35:50.161
-Mm.
-Otherwise, I'll see you tomorrow.

35:50.327 --> 35:52.405
Mm.

36:02.334 --> 36:06.447
These leaves are really tasty.
Try some.

36:11.598 --> 36:13.842
-Dee Dee!
-This is gonna be harder than I thought.

36:14.008 --> 36:15.670
Please, come!

36:17.331 --> 36:22.068
-I need you, please! Dee Dee!
-Good.

36:22.234 --> 36:26.430
-I'll be right back.
-Dee Dee! Dee Dee!

36:53.808 --> 36:56.924
I'm here now, Mama.

36:59.873 --> 37:02.906
I love you, we all do.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.838
I know you tried your best
to always love me.

37:19.399 --> 37:26.545
You made it...
impossible.

37:59.822 --> 38:05.680
You got a mama that loves you.
Do you love your mama?

38:10.665 --> 38:13.407
It's okay, Mama.

38:26.244 --> 38:31.438
In, two, three...

38:31.604 --> 38:34.803
-Out.
-Girls, just stay out there

38:34.969 --> 38:37.586
on the trampoline for a while!

38:37.752 --> 38:41.117
-Hey, you started packing?
-Not yet.

38:41.657 --> 38:44.690
Oh, so you found the money to
buy the place all on your own, then?

38:44.856 --> 38:48.512
That's great. No?
Come on, Dee.

38:48.679 --> 38:51.047
The bank ain't gonna buy back the house
with y'all sitting in it.

38:51.213 --> 38:53.165
Where are we going?

38:53.830 --> 39:00.353
You didn't... oops. All right.
I'll start in there.

39:00.519 --> 39:05.130
Doesn't matter where we go,
as long as we're together.

39:20.502 --> 39:24.864
-I wanna jump on the trampoline.
-Uh...

39:25.030 --> 39:28.187
no, honeybee.

39:30.555 --> 39:34.211
Can I go play with Mollie and Abbie even
if I don't go on the trampoline?

39:34.378 --> 39:36.247
I said no!

39:41.357 --> 39:43.019
Tough love's the only thing
that's gonna keep those kids

39:43.185 --> 39:45.802
from going to hell in a handbasket, Dee,
so good on you.

39:45.969 --> 39:48.503
Here, I found these old letters
in your mom's things.

39:48.669 --> 39:52.408
They look like
they haven't been opened.

40:05.079 --> 40:07.032
Oh...

40:15.839 --> 40:17.916
Gypsy...

40:19.952 --> 40:24.688
Gypsy, girl, where are you?

40:24.854 --> 40:27.305
Gypsy!

40:27.472 --> 40:29.549
Gypsy!

40:29.715 --> 40:31.751
Gypsy!

40:34.534 --> 40:36.196
Oh!

40:37.816 --> 40:40.475
-What happened?
-Now, don't touch her, Dee!

40:40.641 --> 40:44.463
-Don't move her!
-Oh, my God, are you okay?

40:44.630 --> 40:47.870
-Oh, my God!
-Girls, you get down too!

40:48.036 --> 40:51.194
-Get down!
-Are you bleeding?

40:51.360 --> 40:56.304
Here, baby. Oh, sweetheart.

40:56.470 --> 41:00.333
Honey, oh...
oh, don't scare me.

41:00.500 --> 41:03.034
I'll call 911!

41:13.254 --> 41:16.245
-Mommy!
-Chelsea, don't test me.

41:16.411 --> 41:17.990
Mommy! Mom!

41:18.530 --> 41:21.978
You already had dessert,
Chelsea, I said no.

41:22.144 --> 41:25.551
-Mommy! Mommy! Mom, can I get...
-You are trying my last nerve.

41:25.717 --> 41:31.658
Mom, Mommy! Mom! Mommy!

41:31.824 --> 41:35.148
Mom! Mommy!

41:35.314 --> 41:41.089
Mom, can I have candy? Mom!
Mommy! Mom!

41:44.288 --> 41:45.825
Mommy!

41:48.941 --> 41:52.846
Mom! Mommy!

41:53.012 --> 41:57.083
Nick! Nick! Nick, open the door!
Please, please, open the door!

41:59.867 --> 42:05.932
Nick! Nick! Nick?

42:06.099 --> 42:08.051
Why did you...

42:11.790 --> 42:14.407
-I probably should have come with you.
-Why didn't you answer the door?

42:14.574 --> 42:17.440
I was... I was in the bathroom.

42:17.980 --> 42:19.351
I was going to the bathroom
and I heard you,

42:19.517 --> 42:22.426
but then I had to finish
before I could let you in.

42:24.711 --> 42:27.951
We're not even supposed to be here.
We're not even supposed to be here.

42:28.117 --> 42:30.568
We're not even supposed to be
in Springfield right now.

42:31.233 --> 42:36.509
And you're not helping. You are not...
you are not doing this right.

42:36.675 --> 42:40.124
Well, I-I'm sorry.
Sometimes I just don't really know

42:40.290 --> 42:43.322
what I'm supposed to be doing.

42:43.696 --> 42:48.225
Tell me one single thing
that you do know, Nick. Tell me.

42:48.391 --> 42:50.177
Because I can't keep
doing everything for you.

42:50.344 --> 42:54.249
I can't keep... oh, God. I can't keep
fixing everything for you!

42:54.415 --> 42:58.237
-You have to think! You have to think!
-I do think...

42:58.403 --> 43:00.771
No, you have to think about us!

43:05.757 --> 43:08.540
You have to say
everything's gonna be okay,

43:08.706 --> 43:13.401
because you have to make it okay
before it even happens.

43:17.888 --> 43:19.508
I'm...

43:19.674 --> 43:22.167
I do know one thing.

43:23.953 --> 43:27.858
That I will never, ever leave you alone,
Gypsy Rose, because I love you.

43:28.108 --> 43:32.968
And you are the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.707
And also, I'm gonna pretty much

43:36.874 --> 43:40.529
always do anything for you
because I love you.

43:41.111 --> 43:45.224
And I want you to be happily ever after.

43:46.636 --> 43:48.672
I'm sorry.

43:51.373 --> 43:54.862
I'm sorry.

44:05.373 --> 44:08.240
I'm sorry.

44:14.804 --> 44:17.504
Oh...

44:17.670 --> 44:19.374
Here I come.

44:19.540 --> 44:21.119
Okay.

44:21.285 --> 44:22.697
Oh...

44:24.650 --> 44:27.309
Oh, yeah.
There you go.

44:29.926 --> 44:32.211
Now, come on, honey.

44:32.377 --> 44:34.787
-I can walk, Mama.
-Oh, no, you're too weak.

44:34.953 --> 44:37.362
You gotta rest.

44:48.912 --> 44:51.862
Okay.

44:53.440 --> 44:58.758
Okay, baby, you stay here.
Don't move.

45:09.061 --> 45:12.592
Okay. Okay, come on.

45:12.758 --> 45:14.877
Ooh.

45:16.207 --> 45:19.447
Oh, just until you feel better.
