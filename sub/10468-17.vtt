YOU STUCK AGAIN?

00:23.893 --> 00:25.155

00:58.058 --> 01:00.408
WE AGREED THAT
THE WHOLE POINT OF THAT

01:00.408 --> 01:04.238
WAS THAT WE NOT DO
ANYTHING TOO RASH...

01:04.238 --> 01:12.289
RELAX, AND SEE
HOW THINGS TURN OUT,

04:48.462 --> 04:49.637
NO, NO, NO, LOOK--
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

04:49.637 --> 04:50.812
I DON'T LIKE THIS
MANAGEMENT STUFF, ANYWAY.

04:50.812 --> 04:51.943
BUT I'M FINE.

04:56.034 --> 04:57.166
OH, BOY.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.733
YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:02.737 --> 05:05.174

OH, YEAH.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.698

NO, I MEAN IT.

05:13.225 --> 05:14.226
Y-YOU KNOW WHY?

05:14.226 --> 05:16.794
'CAUSE
FEELING LIKE THIS

05:16.794 --> 05:19.667
MEANS I'M PREGNANT,

05:19.667 --> 05:22.060
MEANS THE BABY
IS GROWING.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.106
EVERY BREAKFAST I LOSE,

05:24.106 --> 05:26.935
I'M ONE TOSS CLOSER
TO HAVING OUR BABY.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.634
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.
YOU KNOW THAT?

05:30.634 --> 05:32.288
HEY.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.681
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT,

05:33.681 --> 05:36.858
BUT YOU COULD STAND

THAT WAY, TOO.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.469
OH, YEAH?
HOW'S THAT?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.036
YOU ALWAYS SAY
THAT YOU CAN'T WAIT

05:41.036 --> 05:42.342
TILL YOUR LINES
ARE ALL GOING

05:42.342 --> 05:43.647
SO YOU CAN GET BACK
TO DESIGNING.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.997
SO MAYBE IF YOU
LOOKED AT

05:45.997 --> 05:50.175
ALL THESE HASSLES AS
STEPS TOWARD THAT GOAL,

05:50.175 --> 05:53.091
THEY'D
GIVE YOU LESS PAIN
AND MORE PLEASURE.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.531
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.062
DARN IT.
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ME?

06:07.062 --> 06:08.411
TODD, I KNOW
YOU'RE STRESSED,

06:08.411 --> 06:09.934
BUT JUST RELAX.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.327
I MEAN,
YOU'VE GOT THE JOB.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.895
WHO ELSE COULD FRALEY
POSSIBLY PICK TO DO IT?

06:13.895 --> 06:16.245
I DON'T KNOW.
MARTIN, MAYBE?

06:16.245 --> 06:19.291
MARTIN?

06:19.291 --> 06:21.076
THAT GUY IS SO LAME.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.165
CLAUDIA,
HE WENT TO JULLIARD.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.863
SO? HE DOESN'T HAVE
YOUR BOW CONTROL,

06:25.863 --> 06:27.387
YOUR VIBRATO,
PHRASING.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.215
LOOK, THANKS, BUT YOU
GOTTA SAY THAT.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.696
I MEAN, IT'S, LIKE, IN
THE GIRLFRIEND HANDBOOK,
OR SOMETHING.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.655
TODD, I'M NOT
JUST SAYING THAT.

06:34.655 --> 06:35.656
IT'S TRUE.

06:35.656 --> 06:36.700
LOOK, WHO CARES, ANYWAY?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.876
IT'S JUST FIRST CHAIR.

06:38.876 --> 06:41.357
IT ISA BIG DEAL.
I MEAN, IT MATTERS
WHO GETS THIS.

06:41.357 --> 06:42.924
THAT'S WHY
YOU SHOULD FEEL--

06:42.924 --> 06:44.621
YOU SHOULD FEEL GOOD.
'CAUSE YOU DESERVE IT.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.928
YOU TOTALLY DESERVE IT.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.413
HEY, MR. FRALEY.

06:53.413 --> 06:59.027
HEY. OH, DON'T TELL ME

THAT MUST BE.

07:04.162 --> 07:06.382
YEAH, TOUGH, BUT LATELY

07:30.667 --> 07:32.277

07:36.499 --> 07:38.501

LOOK AT YOU,

ABOUT MORE SEX...

07:52.950 --> 07:54.212
UH-UH.

07:54.212 --> 07:55.475
NO, I FEEL LIKE TALKING.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.041

08:25.592 --> 08:27.419
I MEAN, THE FIRST HALF
OF MY STORY

08:27.419 --> 08:30.553

BUT THE SECOND HALF...

08:30.553 --> 08:31.728

I SHOULD OWN
MORE ORANGE.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.729

IF I GET ENOUGH OF THESE

10:18.661 --> 10:21.838
OH, WELL, I KNOW
I MIGHT BE GETTING
A BIT AHEAD OF MYSELF.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.667
BUT I'LL HAVE
A GOOD TIME IN MILAN,
WON'T I?

10:24.667 --> 10:25.799
SURE, WHY NOT?

10:27.496 --> 10:29.150
HELLO, SIS.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.934
FIONA.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.109
WHAT?

10:32.109 --> 10:34.721
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

10:34.721 --> 10:37.419
WHAT?

10:37.419 --> 10:38.986
NOTHING.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.733
EXCUSE ME.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.169
MILAN.

10:49.953 --> 10:51.085
WOW.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.350
YOU NEVER PREPARED ME
FOR THAT.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.179
DON'T EVEN
GET ME STARTED.

10:58.179 --> 11:01.312
SHE THINKS BIG, THOUGH,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.793
BAILEY, PLEASE.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.536
DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT F.B.E.?

11:09.799 --> 11:12.280
IT'S NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.673
NONE OF IT.

11:13.673 --> 11:17.111
BELIEVE ME,
SHE WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT IT TOMORROW.

11:17.111 --> 11:19.983
I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN
A THOUSAND TIMES.

11:19.983 --> 11:20.897
WHAT?

11:20.897 --> 11:24.379
SHE GAVE UP UNIVERSITY
TO GO TRAVELING,

11:24.379 --> 11:28.339
SHE GAVE THAT UP
FOR GOD KNOWS HOW MANY
DIFFERENT DAY JOBS,

11:28.339 --> 11:30.385
AND SHE GAVE THAT UP
TO FOLLOW A YOGI.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.692
I MEAN, SHE SPENDS
SO MUCH BLOODY TIME
TRYING TO FIND HERSELF

11:32.692 --> 11:36.652
THAT IT JUST GETS HER
EVEN MORE LOST.

11:36.652 --> 11:39.873
RIGHT, BUT YOU'RE NOT
SAYING THAT SHE SHOULD
GIVE UP TRYING, ARE YOU?

11:39.873 --> 11:43.224
I MEAN, HOW ELSE
IS SHE SUPPOSED TO FIND

11:43.224 --> 11:45.356
THE THING
THAT SHE LOVES ENOUGH
NOT TO GIVE UP ON?

11:45.356 --> 11:46.401
OH, BAILEY,
OF COURSE NOT.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.185
SHE'S MY OLDER SISTER,
AND I LOVE HER.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.231
BUT SHE'S 27 YEARS OLD.

11:50.231 --> 11:53.364
QUITE FRANKLY,
THE MORE SHE KEEPS ON
CHANGING HER MIND,

11:53.364 --> 11:58.848
THE MORE I WONDER
WHETHER THIS THING
ACTUALLY EXISTS.

11:58.848 --> 12:02.025
GOD, I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.418
FORGET IT.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.159
WE'VE GOT BETTER THINGS
TO TALK ABOUT.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.160
HOLLY...

12:06.160 --> 12:08.728
WHAT?

12:08.728 --> 12:11.818
THE...THING--
WHATEVER--
HER CALLING.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.776
I MEAN,
THAT HAS TO EXIST.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.777
RIGHT?

12:14.777 --> 12:17.649
BAILEY, I WASN'T
TALKING GENERALLY.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.478
I WAS JUST TALKING
ABOUT HER.

12:20.478 --> 12:22.524
YEAH.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.314
MRS. WONG.

12:30.314 --> 12:32.229
HI. CHARLIE SALINGER.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.188
I'M SO SORRY
TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.624
THAT'S OK.

12:35.624 --> 12:38.845
I WAS JUST LOOKING OVER
YOUR LATEST LINE.
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

12:38.845 --> 12:42.283
OH, GOOD, GOOD.
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

12:42.283 --> 12:45.199
THE NEW STUFF
THAT WE'RE MAKING
IS A LOT DIFFERENT

12:45.199 --> 12:48.071
THAN THE STUFF
YOU'VE PURCHASED
FROM US IN THE PAST.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.072
IN THE PAST?

12:49.072 --> 12:50.595
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:50.595 --> 12:52.249
I'M SORRY, MRS. WONG,
BUT AREN'T YOU

12:52.249 --> 12:54.599
FROM SWEET'S
DISCOUNT FURNITURE
IN BOISE?

12:54.599 --> 12:58.952
NO, I'M A BUYER
FOR DISCOUNT SUITES HOTELS
IN PHOENIX.

12:58.952 --> 13:02.129
A FEW MONTHS AGO,
I SAW YOUR BOOTH
AT THE FURNITURE EXPO.

13:02.129 --> 13:06.046
I APOLOGIZE.
I'M NOT NORMALLY SO...

13:06.046 --> 13:07.525
WE'RE A LITTLE
UNDERSTAFFED RIGHT NOW.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.919
WHY DON'T I BRING YOU
UP TO SPEED ON OUR SITUATION?

13:09.919 --> 13:10.920
OK.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.921
WE'RE REPOSITIONING,

13:11.921 --> 13:13.923
SHOOTING FOR
A MORE UPSCALE CUSTOMER,

13:13.923 --> 13:15.925
WHICH MEANS
MAJOR REMODELING.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.535
YOUR DESIGNS
FEEL HAND-CRAFTED,

13:17.535 --> 13:19.450
AND THAT'S THE SENSIBILITY
WE'RE AFTER.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.191
AH, HERE IT IS.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.976
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

13:22.976 --> 13:26.588
WE HAVE 72 HOTELS,
EACH WITH ABOUT 50 ROOMS.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.546
EACH ROOM HAS 2 CHAIRS.

13:28.546 --> 13:31.114
WE WANT THOSE CHAIRS
TO BE YOURS,
MR. SALINGER.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.115
YOUR DIANA CHAIRS.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.290
WOW.

13:33.290 --> 13:36.598
THAT'S LIKE...
A BILLION CHAIRS,
OR SOMETHING.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.295
MORE LIKE 7,000 OR SO.

13:38.295 --> 13:41.908
WELL, UM...

13:41.908 --> 13:43.474
FOR US, IT'S KIND OF
THE SAME THING.

13:43.474 --> 13:47.478
SEE, WE'RE
A SMALL OPERATION,
MS. WONG.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.089
SO GET BIGGER.

13:49.089 --> 13:52.483
RIGHT, WELL,
THAT MEANS DELAYS
AND START-UP COSTS

13:52.483 --> 13:54.790
THAT YOU'D
HAVE TO ABSORB.

13:54.790 --> 13:55.791
FINE.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.532
WORK IT OUT,
AND WE'LL TALK.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.882
I'LL BE IN TOWN
FOR 2 MORE DAYS.

13:59.882 --> 14:00.883
WAIT, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.058
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU

14:02.058 --> 14:05.583
IS THAT I'M NOT SURE
THAT WE CAN HANDLE THIS.

14:05.583 --> 14:08.282
YOU AREN'T ACTUALLY THINKING
OF TURNING US DOWN, ARE YOU?

14:08.282 --> 14:11.415
NO, NO, I, UH...

14:14.375 --> 14:15.637
I DON'T KNOW.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.645
I'M TELLING YOU,
I DON'T THINK IT WORKS THAT WAY.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.212
SHE HAS TO USE THE PEDAL
TO GET IT GOING.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.127
NO, NO, NO--
SHE, SHE JUST HAS TO
TURN IT MANUALLY.

14:27.127 --> 14:30.173
THESE OLD MACHINES
DON'T HAVE FLYWHEELS
TO TRANSFER THE TORQUE--

14:30.173 --> 14:31.740
YOU'RE WRONG.
IT'S FOOT PRESSURE.

14:31.740 --> 14:35.744
HERE, FIONA,
YOU HAVE TO FEATHER
THE PEDAL, LIKE THIS.

14:35.744 --> 14:36.963
GUYS.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.269
I CAN ADJUST THIS.
LOOK, JUST INSIDE
THE ARM--

14:39.269 --> 14:40.792
NOW, I'LL PUSH
YOUR FOOT FOR YOU.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.490
DID YOU MAKE THESE SHOES?

14:42.490 --> 14:43.795
THEY'RE VERY NICE.

14:43.795 --> 14:45.580
GUYS.
WHAT?
Griffin: WHAT?

14:45.580 --> 14:48.496
WE'RE TAKING THE MACHINE
BACK TO HOLLY'S PLACE.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.714
WHY?
Griffin: WHY?

14:49.714 --> 14:50.802
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT
TO FINISH HER PIECES

14:50.802 --> 14:52.369
SO SHE CAN SHOW THEM
AROUND TO BOUTIQUES.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.632
AND SHE'S ONLY GOING
TO BE AROUND FOR
A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.243
OH, BUT YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING

14:56.243 --> 14:58.419
I REALLY
OUGHT TO STAY HERE
A BIT LONGER.

14:58.419 --> 15:01.030
YEAH, BUT, FI, DEAR,
WHAT ABOUT THAT WEDDING

15:01.030 --> 15:02.640
THAT YOU HAVE TO
GET BACK TO IN LONDON?

15:02.640 --> 15:04.555
OH, GOOD POINT, SIS.

15:04.555 --> 15:07.080
WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS
IS ME OUT OF HER FLAT.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.646
YOU CAN STAY
ON MY COUCH.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.736
NO, NO, NO,
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
IN THE HOUSE HERE.

15:11.736 --> 15:12.912
EXCUSE ME?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.262
I REALLY CAN'T STAY
AND WATCH THIS.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.699
I HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.309
WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT
WITH THIS?

15:19.309 --> 15:20.441
YEAH.

15:22.617 --> 15:23.618
TROUBLE.

15:23.618 --> 15:24.836
OH, TROUBLE.

15:24.836 --> 15:25.968
[SIGHS]

15:25.968 --> 15:27.970
OK, FIONA,
YOU READY FOR WORK?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.972
I LINED UP A BUNCH
OF APPOINTMENTS
FOR YOU TODAY.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.019
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, BAY?
WHY DOES IT MATTER SO MUCH
IF SHE GOES BACK TO WORK NOW?

15:33.019 --> 15:34.150
LOOK, IT MATTERS.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.369
OK? SHE'S BEEN
WORKING ON THIS THING

15:35.369 --> 15:36.587
FOR A LONG TIME, WILL.

15:36.587 --> 15:39.764
AND WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT HER FUTURE,
RIGHT, FIONA?

15:39.764 --> 15:42.811
WELL, COULDN'T I STAY
AND FINISH MY COFFEE FIRST?

15:42.811 --> 15:44.552
YOU REMEMBER F.B.E.?

15:44.552 --> 15:46.249
YES.

15:46.249 --> 15:50.210
YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT TO
TURN OUT TO BE F.B.S.,
WOULD YOU?

15:50.210 --> 15:51.863
BLOODY HELL, NO.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.127
Bailey:
LET'S GO.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.911
COME ON.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.741
SEE YA, FELLAS.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.054
SO, LET'S SEE.

16:08.054 --> 16:12.884
20,000 SQUARE FEET
AT $30 PER FOOT,
PER YEAR.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.712
Charlie:
DALE, I DON'T GET IT.

16:14.712 --> 16:17.106
I MEAN, WHY IS THIS PLACE
SO MUCH HIGHER THAN
ALL THE OTHERS?

16:17.106 --> 16:19.543
Dale: THIS IS A CHOICE
INDUSTRIAL SETUP.

16:19.543 --> 16:22.024
YOU GOT YOUR HEAVY
POWER SOURCING,

16:22.024 --> 16:25.027
WAREHOUSE AND DISTRIBUTION
FACILITIES,

16:25.027 --> 16:27.638
NOT TO MENTION
YOUR T-COM
INFRASTRUCTURE.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.597
T-COM?

16:29.597 --> 16:32.426
DALE, I JUST NEED
A PLACE TO MAKE
SOME CHAIRS.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.689
I MEAN, HOW COMPLICATED
CAN THAT BE?

16:34.689 --> 16:36.212
WHAT ABOUT
ZONING?

16:36.212 --> 16:40.086
HIGHWAY ACCESS?
INSURANCE?
WASTE MANAGEMENT?

16:40.086 --> 16:42.305
WHAT ARE YOUR
UTILITY NEEDS?

16:42.305 --> 16:44.264
AND ALL THAT
WITHOUT MENTIONING
THE "T" WORD.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.352
T-COM?

16:45.352 --> 16:46.614
TAXES.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.312
WE CAN FIGURE OUT
A TAX-DEFERRED
EXCHANGE

16:49.312 --> 16:53.186
OR MAYBE SOME KIND
OF SALE/LEASEBACK
OPTION.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.753
DALE, LOOK,
I GOTTA LEVEL
WITH YOU, HERE.

16:55.753 --> 16:57.842
IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE SPEAKING
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE

16:57.842 --> 16:59.627
THAT I TOOK
A SEMESTER OF
IN COLLEGE.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.672
I'M ONLY
GETTING, LIKE,
EVERY FIFTH WORD.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.936
SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED
SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP
THERE, MR. SALINGER.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.070
WELL, DALE,
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.767
AREN'T YOU THE EXPERT?

17:09.767 --> 17:12.509
YEAH, BUT IT'S
YOUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.337
I CAN SHOW YOU
A MILLION FACTORIES,

17:14.337 --> 17:17.558
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU,
NOW, CAN I?

17:26.262 --> 17:28.047
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.005
HEY.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.746
I'M JUST WRITING.

17:31.746 --> 17:34.662
HERE? YOU TRYING
TO HIDE FROM ME?

17:34.662 --> 17:37.012
WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOUDOING?

17:37.012 --> 17:39.014
WHAT DOES IT
FEEL LIKE?

17:39.014 --> 17:40.842
FEELS LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO START SOMETHING.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.278
TRYING?
I'M STARTING IT.

17:42.278 --> 17:43.671
JULIA.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.368
ARE YOU BY ANY CHANCE
PROCRASTINATING?

17:45.368 --> 17:46.326
WHAT?

17:46.326 --> 17:47.414
THE STORIES
ARE DUE FRIDAY,

17:47.414 --> 17:48.545
AND YOU TOLD ME
LAST NIGHT

17:48.545 --> 17:50.460
THAT YOU WERE
THROWING OUT
HALF YOUR DRAFT.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.202
THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE
I CAME UP WITH SUCH
A GOOD IDEA FOR AN ENDING,

17:53.202 --> 17:55.639
I HAD TO REWRITE
THE MIDDLE TO FIT IT IN.

17:55.639 --> 17:56.988
SO...

17:56.988 --> 17:59.861
SO, THE REASON
I CAME UP WITH
SUCH AN EXCELLENT ENDING

17:59.861 --> 18:01.993
WAS THIS.

18:01.993 --> 18:03.952
MY EARLOBE?

18:03.952 --> 18:04.909
SEX.

18:04.909 --> 18:07.347
SEX?
MM-HMM.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.783
IT ALWAYS AFFECTED ME
THIS WAY,

18:08.783 --> 18:10.001
MAKES ME ALL WIRISH.

18:10.001 --> 18:12.221
NEVER KNEW WHAT IT
WOULD DO FOR MY WRITING.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.788
HUH.

18:13.788 --> 18:18.488
HUH? THE APPROPRIATE
ONE-WORD RESPONSE
IS RRRAARR.

18:18.488 --> 18:19.707
YEAH.

18:19.707 --> 18:23.145
EXCEPT WHAT IF IT
DOES THE OPPOSITE
THING TO ME?

18:23.145 --> 18:27.367
I MEAN, WHAT IF SEX
MAKES ME A BLISSED-OUT
SENSELESS BLOB?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.499
HUH.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.545
EXACTLY.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.852
WELL, CAN'T YOU HAVE SEX AND
THEN DRINK CAFFEINE AFTERWARDS?

18:34.852 --> 18:37.899
NO, IT DOESN'T
WAKE UP MY MIND.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.553
AND THE STORIES
ARE DUE FRIDAY.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.597
REMEMBER?

18:40.597 --> 18:41.642
I REMEMBER.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.339
JULIA.

18:43.339 --> 18:45.211
COME ON.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.909
OK.

18:47.909 --> 18:51.391
SO, WHAT IF I HELP YOU
WORK ON YOUR STORY?

18:51.391 --> 18:52.827
WILL YOU?

18:52.827 --> 18:55.438
AS SOON AS YOU
WORK ON MINE.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.356
WORK ON IT, ADAM.

19:13.761 --> 19:19.114
OK, THE AD AGENCY NEEDS
THIS TRACK IN AN HOUR.

19:19.114 --> 19:22.552
SO, TAKE A LOOK AT IT,
AND WE'LL START
IN A MINUTE.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.513
WANT ME TO
RUB YOUR HANDS
OR ANYTHING?

19:26.513 --> 19:27.601
WARM THEM UP?

19:27.601 --> 19:29.255
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU GET
NERVOUS...

19:29.255 --> 19:30.604
NO, I'M OK.

19:30.604 --> 19:34.303
THIS IS SOMETHING
A BEGINNER COULD PLAY.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.087
OF COURSE,
A BEGINNER

19:36.087 --> 19:38.481
DOESN'T HAVE TO
SET THE DYNAMICS
FOR EVERYBODY

19:38.481 --> 19:41.484
OR PICK UP THE TEMPO
OR GIVE THE CUES.

19:41.484 --> 19:44.008
TODD.

19:44.008 --> 19:47.011
I KNOW WHAT
FIRST CHAIR DOES.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.048
NO, NO, NOT THE END
OF THE STORY.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.789

THE END OF THE PROCESS.

WHAT YOU GET AT THE END.

28:26.182 --> 28:27.227

TALKING ABOUT?

28:27.227 --> 28:28.576
THE ONLY REASON
YOU WANT ME RIGHT NOW

28:28.576 --> 28:30.447
IS TO FINISH YOUR STORY
SO THAT YOU CAN
GET PUBLISHED.

28:30.447 --> 28:32.014
WHAT?!

28:32.014 --> 28:34.190
YOU'VE BEEN UP FRONT
ABOUT WHY YOU WANT THE SEX.

28:34.190 --> 28:37.672
YOU KNOW, HOW IT
GETS YOU ALL WIRED
AND FULL OF IDEAS.

28:37.672 --> 28:38.760
OK, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA!

28:38.760 --> 28:40.109
OF COURSE I WOULD LOVE
TO GET PUBLISHED.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.546
BUT, ADAM,
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I DON'T WANT YOU FOR YOU.

28:42.546 --> 28:44.287

I MEAN, COME ON.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.811
I MEAN, WHEN IT'S DONE--
WHEN ALL THE WRITING
IS FINISHED--

28:45.811 --> 28:47.073
IT'S NOT GONNA
CHANGE HOW I FEEL.

28:47.073 --> 28:50.554
I'M STILL GONNA WANT YOU,
BELIEVE ME.

28:50.554 --> 28:52.600
ADAM, WHAT IS SO WRONG
WITH WANTING TO GET
PUBLISHED, ANYWAYS?

28:52.600 --> 28:53.557
I MEAN, YOU WANT
TO GET PUBLISHED, TOO.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.558
I NEVER SAID THAT.

28:54.558 --> 28:55.603
OF COURSE YOU WANT THAT.

28:55.603 --> 28:56.560
WHAT'S THE POINT
OTHERWISE?

28:56.560 --> 28:58.345
WHAT IS THE POINT?

28:58.345 --> 29:00.216
JULIA, HOW CAN YOU
SAY THAT?

29:00.216 --> 29:01.348
THE POINT IS--

29:01.348 --> 29:04.525
THE REASON FOR DOING IT

29:18.017 --> 29:19.105

BE BETTER.

THAT I WAS GRATEFUL FOR
EVERY LOST BREAKFAST

30:11.374 --> 30:15.509

TO SAVOR THE JOURNEY,
OR WHATEVER?

30:15.509 --> 30:16.684

30:16.684 --> 30:18.991

ON THIS SHORT NOTICE--
THAT CAN DO THE JOB.

30:49.456 --> 30:52.851
SO I SAT DOWN
TO DO IT MYSELF--

30:52.851 --> 30:55.897
RAN ALL THESE NUMBERS,
DID ALL THIS LEGWORK.

30:55.897 --> 31:00.771
THE MORE I DID IT,
THE MORE I THOUGHT...
WHY?

31:00.771 --> 31:02.948
I MEAN, I CAN'T STAND
THIS STUFF.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.820

WHY I TOOK THE JOB.

31:07.778 --> 31:10.085

31:16.787 --> 31:19.965

IT'S NOT FUN AND STUFF,

31:19.965 --> 31:21.923
BUT THINK ABOUT
WHAT IT GIVES YOU.

31:21.923 --> 31:26.972
AT A CERTAIN POINT,
THE STUFF THAT YOU'RE
DOING TO GET SOMEPLACE,

31:26.972 --> 31:30.105
IT'S NOT JUST
SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE PASSING THROUGH,

31:30.105 --> 31:32.151
I MEAN,
IT BECOMES YOUR LIFE.

31:32.151 --> 31:36.329

IS SUPPOSED TO BE
SOMETHING ELSE.

31:36.329 --> 31:40.246
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
SPENDING TIME HERE,

31:40.246 --> 31:42.378
WITH MY PREGNANT WIFE.

31:42.378 --> 31:47.122

SPENDING TIME DREAMING UP
NEW IDEAS OF STUFF TO BUILD,

TO FINANCE SOME FACTORY.

THAT ON ANYTHING

FOR ME, PLEASE?

HOW THE SEAT TAPERS.

WELL, IF IT HAPPENS,
IT HAPPENS.

GONNA SPEND ANY MONEY.

THAT SHE CAN'T EXPECT
FROM REAL LIFE.

IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU,
BUT IT DOESN'T GET HER
ANYWHERE.

SHE CAN SPEND MORE TIME
AND MORE MONEY

41:15.298 --> 41:17.387
SO, WHERE DID YOU GO
BACK THERE?

41:17.387 --> 41:19.955
AFTER
THE BUTTERFLY STAMPEDE.

41:19.955 --> 41:23.219
SEEMED LIKE
YOUR MIND WANDERED.

41:23.219 --> 41:24.917
DON'T BE MAD.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.572
I HAD AN IDEA,
A STORY IDEA.

41:27.572 --> 41:31.053
THAT'S OK.
I DON'T MIND.

41:31.053 --> 41:33.316
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANT TO WRITE
SOMETHING DOWN...

41:34.927 --> 41:37.233
NO.

41:37.233 --> 41:40.236
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M MORE IN THE MOOD
FOR READING.

41:59.604 --> 42:01.954
[CLEARS THROAT]

42:05.697 --> 42:08.351
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

42:08.351 --> 42:09.918
I THINK THAT WAS
THE INTERNATIONAL SIGN FOR,

42:09.918 --> 42:11.441
"PAY YOUR CHECK
AND GET OUT OF HERE,

42:11.441 --> 42:13.095
BECAUSE I WANT
TO GO HOME."

42:13.095 --> 42:15.358
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

42:15.358 --> 42:18.579
WE WERE HAVING DESSERT,
AND NOW IT'S
2 HOURS LATER.

42:18.579 --> 42:19.711
YEESH.

42:26.979 --> 42:28.458
SO...

42:28.458 --> 42:31.636
SO?

42:31.636 --> 42:34.900
UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

42:34.900 --> 42:35.944
LIKE?

42:35.944 --> 42:39.165
LIKE, UM...

42:39.165 --> 42:41.689
HOME?

42:41.689 --> 42:42.690
MAYBE?

42:42.690 --> 42:48.130
YEAH, WE COULD DO THAT.

42:48.130 --> 42:50.785
ON THE OTHER HAND,
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

42:50.785 --> 42:53.440
WE'VE GOT
A NICE TABLE HERE,

42:53.440 --> 42:54.441
CANDLE.

42:54.441 --> 42:57.966
WE'VE GOT EACH OTHER.

42:57.966 --> 43:00.926
WHY NOT JUST STAY HERE
FOR A WHILE?

43:00.926 --> 43:03.319
YOU MAKE
A BEAUTIFUL POINT.
