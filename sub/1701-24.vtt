WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:05.713
- How did the audition go?
- Incredible.

00:05.922 --> 00:08.507
I met the director.
You'll never believe who it was.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.758
Who?

00:10.093 --> 00:11.593
I'll give you one hint.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.138
Warren Beatty.

00:14.305 --> 00:15.347
Wow.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.726
There's just one thing
that might be a problem.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.437
See, I had to kiss this guy.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.106
Because he was just so darn cute?

00:24.649 --> 00:27.276
No, part of the audition.
I'm up for the part of this guy...

00:27.527 --> 00:29.111
...who the main guy kisses.

00:29.362 --> 00:33.907
Well, you're an actor. I say
you just suck it up and you do it.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.329
Or you just do it.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.957
I did do it.
I'm a professional.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.001
- What's the problem?
- After the scene...

00:44.210 --> 00:48.672
...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and
he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser."

00:48.882 --> 00:52.092
Can you believe that?
Me, not a good kisser.

00:52.343 --> 00:53.719
That's like...

00:54.220 --> 00:56.680
...Mother Teresa, not a good mother. Pfft.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.975
Who cares what that guy thinks?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.895
What does Warren Beatty
know about kissing? Heh.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.815
Oh. Heh, heh.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.568
The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding

01:56.825 --> 01:58.117
What did your agent say?

01:58.368 --> 02:00.911
Yep. This kiss thing is
definitely a problem.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.038
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again
on Monday.

02:03.873 --> 02:06.333
Man, I gotta figure out
what I'm doing wrong.

02:06.543 --> 02:09.336
Oh, okay. One of you girls
come over here and kiss me.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.839
- Forget it.
- Yeah, right.

02:12.048 --> 02:14.049
Hey, come on.
I need your help here.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.761
I'll do it. I've kissed him before.
I can do it again.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.139
See this, huh? This is a friend.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.266
Uh-huh. Let's go.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.226
Oh, wait. I have gum.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.520
Okay.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.948
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.867
I'd recommend you to a friend.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.787
Then I don't know
what the problem is.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.165
Maybe you're not used
to kissing men.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.250
Maybe you tensed up a little.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.127
Maybe you need to work on it.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.254
Yeah, that makes sense.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.219
Over my dead body.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.934
And I'll be using
his dead body as a shield.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.483
Come out, honey.
I'm telling you, you look good.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.570
Tell her she looks good.
Tell her she looks good.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.077
Oh, my God! Ha, ha, ha.

03:26.122 --> 03:28.457
You look so good!

03:29.709 --> 03:33.837
I cannot believe I have to walk down
the aisle in front of 200 people...

03:34.047 --> 03:37.132
...looking like something
you drink when you're nauseous.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.969
So don't.
I don't see why we have to go to this thing.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.388
It's your ex-fiancÃ©'s wedding.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.849
Because I promised Mindy I would.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.894
Yeah, well, you promised Barry
you'd marry him.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.357
You guys, I have to go.
I'm the maid of honor.

03:53.566 --> 03:57.319
Besides, I need to be in a room
again with these people...

03:57.528 --> 03:59.780
...and feel good about myself.

04:08.373 --> 04:12.084
Someone's wearing the same clothes
they had on last night. Get a little action?

04:12.293 --> 04:13.335
I may have.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.128
Whoo-hoo! Stud!

04:16.380 --> 04:18.005
- What's she look like?
- We haven't met.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.676
We stayed up all night talking
on the Internet.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.637
Whoo-hoo! Geek!

04:24.847 --> 04:27.724
I like this girl.
I seriously like this girl.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.395
You know how I tend to get
a little defended and quippy?

04:31.604 --> 04:33.814
- Get out.
- No. Please.

04:34.023 --> 04:38.735
Well, she called me on it, okay?
She said, "Cut it out, get real."

04:39.195 --> 04:40.404
And I did.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.780
Wow.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.157
What's that like?

04:45.702 --> 04:47.953
It's like this. Me.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.371
No jokes.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.582
Stop it.
You're freaking me out.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.044
Yeah. I don't like you this way.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.380
I'll see you guys later.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.507
- Bye, Richard.
- Bye-bye.

05:00.925 --> 05:02.884
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.678
I love you too.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.604
I think my boyfriend's
ever so dreamy.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.150
I wonder what
our wedding will be like.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.945
What are you talking about?
What wedding?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.031
Come on. You never talk about that?

05:24.282 --> 05:26.116
No, never.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.577
We're just living in the moment.

05:28.786 --> 05:32.789
It is so nice for once not to get
hung up on, "Where is this going?"

05:32.999 --> 05:36.126
- Afraid to ask him?
- Could not be more terrified.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.171
I think you should
seriously consider marriage.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.175
Give Rachel another chance to dress
like Princess Bubble Yum.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.597
Where's Benny?

05:49.098 --> 05:50.891
There he is!

05:51.184 --> 05:52.517
Where's Benny?

05:52.727 --> 05:54.519
There he is!

05:57.023 --> 06:01.943
That's probably why babies learn to talk,
so they can tell grownups to cut it out.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.947
Hey, I got a question for you.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.158
Just a little thing, no pressure.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.451
Okay.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.748
Do you ever, uh, think about the future?

06:15.124 --> 06:16.166
Sure, I do.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.460
Yeah? Am I in it?

06:19.670 --> 06:20.712
Honey...

06:21.130 --> 06:22.172
...you are it.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.510
Oh, God.
You're about to get so lucky.

06:26.761 --> 06:27.969
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.267
- Keep talking.
- Well...

06:34.435 --> 06:37.396
...sometimes I think about
selling my practice.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.358
We could move to France.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.736
- Make French toast.
- Ooh.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.154
Okay, so...

06:46.739 --> 06:48.448
...we're in France...

06:49.492 --> 06:51.576
...and we're making the toast.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.288
Do you see a little bassinet
in the corner?

06:56.457 --> 06:57.624
Like a hound?

07:00.086 --> 07:01.878
Not a basset.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.672
A bassinet.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.176
You really need the bassinet?

07:08.553 --> 07:12.597
Well, I just think the baby
would keep falling off the dog.

07:14.308 --> 07:19.187
- Do you not see kids in our future?
- Oh. Heh.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.772
I love children.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.858
I have children.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.486
I don't wanna be 70
when our kids go off to college...

07:26.696 --> 07:28.405
...and our life can finally start.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.577
- Hm.
- Look.

07:33.744 --> 07:35.370
I want you...

07:35.746 --> 07:36.913
...now.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.960
Well, that's great.
We don't need to talk about this now.

07:42.170 --> 07:46.423
Really, I mean this is so, like,
way, way, way in the future.

07:46.674 --> 07:50.343
I'm talking hovercrafts
and apes taking over the planet. Heh, heh.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.684
Come on, Chandler.
I want this part so much.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.812
Just one kiss.
I won't tell anyone.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.148
Joey, no means no.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.359
Hey.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.822
I'm sorry,
we don't have your sheep.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.370
Aw, Rach, I think you look cute.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.124
And you. You...

08:22.084 --> 08:25.712
- You, I could eat you with a spoon.
- Get away from me. I said no.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.758
Richard buzzed. He's downstairs.

08:29.967 --> 08:33.303
Richard's here?
I should run down, say goodbye to him.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.767
- Bye.
- Good luck.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.104
How's your date
with your cyber-chick going?

08:43.313 --> 08:44.606
Hey, what is all that?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.901
It's a web site.
It's the Guggenheim Museum.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.237
She likes art...

08:50.947 --> 08:53.156
...and I like funny words.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.992
What does she mean by "H.H."?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.996
It means we're holding hands.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.624
Are you the cutest?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.085
I'm afraid I might just be.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.840
I think it's so great
that you're totally into this person...

09:11.050 --> 09:15.887
...yet for all you know, she could be
90 years old or have two heads.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.807
It could be a guy.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.769
It's not a guy, all right?
I know her.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.480
It could be like a big, giant guy.

09:28.192 --> 09:32.779
Man, I got this close to him,
and Monica kneed me in the back.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.614
What's going on?

09:34.824 --> 09:37.784
We're wondering if
Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.911
Ask her how long she's gonna live.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.746
Women live longer than men.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.711
How do you not fall down more?

09:49.547 --> 09:53.049
Okay, ask her what is her method
of birth control.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.509
All right.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.807
"My husband is sleeping
with his secretary."

10:02.143 --> 10:03.852
She's married?

10:04.645 --> 10:06.688
At least we know she's a woman.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.817
I can't believe she's married.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.236
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.616
This must be really tough for you.

10:21.579 --> 10:25.832
I read this article that says
you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings...

10:26.000 --> 10:28.918
...because when pigeons eat rice,
it kills them.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.713
That's why you never see
pigeons in sushi bars.

10:34.008 --> 10:37.010
- See, we're having fun.
- Oh, absolutely.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.139
I'm not even thinking about that thing
that we're not gonna think about.

10:41.349 --> 10:42.641
Neither am I.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.727
Hey, there.
Are you all right?

10:45.936 --> 10:49.689
Yeah. But in the bathroom, I saw
the window I crawled out of at my wedding.

10:49.899 --> 10:53.902
And, God, I just started thinking
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.

10:54.111 --> 10:58.323
People are gonna be looking at me and
judging me and thinking about the last time.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.950
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
It's a wedding.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.119
Generally, people focus on the bride.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.288
I know, you're right.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.624
Alrighty.
Everybody look at me. Good.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.418
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

11:10.628 --> 11:12.545
...let's see two lines.
Thank you.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.091
I'll see you after the thing.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.094
- Okay. Good luck.
- Thank you. Okay.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.637
Okay.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.598
Ah.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.814
Why didn't you tell me?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.065
What could I do?

11:32.316 --> 11:35.360
Stand up and shout,
"Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!"

11:35.569 --> 11:37.487
Oh, my God. This is so humiliating.

11:37.738 --> 11:40.907
The only thing that tops that
was when I was in eighth grade...

11:41.075 --> 11:44.703
...and I had to sing the "Copacabana"
in front of the entire school.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.788
Two lines into it, I ran and freaked out.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.332
Oh, my God. My entire life's flashing
before my eyes.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.669
Rach, look, I remember that.
It wasn't so bad.

11:52.920 --> 11:55.880
Ross, would you stop!
You got me. I'm dating you.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.425
Rachel.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.844
Hi, Mr. Weinberg. Hi, Mrs. Weinberg.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.680
It's wonderful
to see you again, my dear.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.267
In fact, I hardly expected
to see so much.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.230
- You told me you didn't see anything.
- I tell you a lot of things.

12:13.607 --> 12:17.193
Well, it's wonderful to have you
up and about again, dear.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.945
Stay well.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.951
That's the third time someone has
said something like that to me today.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.953
- Rach!
- Hi.

12:27.121 --> 12:29.622
- Oh, my God, I'm married!
- I know!

12:29.957 --> 12:32.417
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter,
hyphen, Farber.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.587
I am so proud of you, Min.

12:35.796 --> 12:36.838
Min.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.424
Oh, Rach. Still here.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.136
At our wedding, they were packing up
the chopped liver about now.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.888
Yeah, I love that story.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.266
Ahem. I have a question for you guys.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.686
Why do people keep saying
it's good to see me up and about?

12:52.271 --> 12:54.773
After you ran out on your wedding...

12:54.982 --> 12:58.193
...Barry's parents told people
you were sort of...

12:58.402 --> 12:59.569
...insane.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.323
- Insane?
- From the syphilis.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.116
What?

13:06.118 --> 13:09.204
What were they gonna say?
You didn't love me anymore? Come on.

13:11.832 --> 13:12.916
Angela?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.501
Joey Tribbiani.

13:15.252 --> 13:18.379
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

13:18.672 --> 13:22.550
I know you're seeing that guy.
I was thinking maybe you could bring him...

13:22.802 --> 13:25.053
Hello? Hello?

13:35.356 --> 13:39.234
You gonna answer her? That's the 10th
bing-bong message she's sent.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.821
- She wants to know what's wrong.
- What's wrong? You're married!

13:43.030 --> 13:44.489
That's what's wrong!

13:46.784 --> 13:48.201
Oh, my.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.662
- What?
- She wants to meet you in person.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.665
Look, Phoebe,
I wanted to meet her in person too.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.167
But she's married.
She has a husband.

13:56.418 --> 13:59.838
What if the husband is the wrong guy
and you are the right guy?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.674
You don't get chances like this
all the time.

14:02.883 --> 14:05.677
If you don't meet her, you'll
kick yourself when you're 80...

14:05.886 --> 14:08.388
...which is hard to do
and that's how you break a hip.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.559
Okay. I'll do it.

14:12.768 --> 14:17.397
Okay, great! Put on your shoes
and then march out there and meet her.

14:17.606 --> 14:20.525
No, wait! You have
to take a shower because ew!

14:20.776 --> 14:22.026
And I'll get the...

14:23.445 --> 14:25.405
No, you have to answer her.
Answer her first.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.658
No, make some coffee
because it's too much.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.745
Tall and tan, and young and lovely

14:32.913 --> 14:36.207
Okay, one more, please.
I'm gonna get it in this time.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.293
Okay, last chance.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.842
Again, I'm sorry.

14:50.139 --> 14:53.600
You know what, maybe I don't
need to have children.

14:53.809 --> 14:57.478
Maybe I just think I do
because that's what society...

14:57.688 --> 14:59.731
...and by that I mean my mom...

15:01.025 --> 15:02.984
...has always convinced me that l...

15:03.152 --> 15:06.070
But I want her so badly

15:07.740 --> 15:09.157
I do.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.035
I have to have children.
I'm sorry, I just do.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.998
Yo, could I have your attention?

15:17.207 --> 15:19.334
Best man making a toast here.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.127
Thank you. Ahem.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.340
I remember when Barry got home
from his first date with Rachel.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.133
Huh?

15:28.761 --> 15:32.013
What? You hired the same band.
I can't use the same speech?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.266
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.353
Anyway, I wish you both...

15:38.562 --> 15:40.939
- ...a wonderful life together.
- Aw.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.148
And, Rachel.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.652
- What?
- No, no, in all seriousness.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.780
Not a lot of women would
have the guts to come back here.

15:48.989 --> 15:51.616
And even fewer who'd do it
with their asses hanging out.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.577
That's it.

15:59.875 --> 16:02.335
I'd like to add something to that.

16:02.544 --> 16:05.713
- What are you adding? What are you adding?
- It's okay. It's okay.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.634
Most of you don't know me.
I'm Rachel's boyfriend...

16:09.843 --> 16:10.927
Oh, dear God.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.179
...Ross.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.473
And I'd just like to say that...

16:15.724 --> 16:20.228
...it did take a lot of courage
for Rachel to come here tonight.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.271
And just for the record...

16:23.232 --> 16:26.651
...she did not run out on Barry
because she had syphilis.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.864
What are you doing? I'm serious.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.242
The reason...

16:34.451 --> 16:37.954
...she walked out on Barry
is simply that...

16:38.163 --> 16:39.706
...she didn't love him.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.584
Which, incidentally,
worked out pretty well for me. Heh, heh.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.010
Cheers.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.680
- See you in the parking lot.
- No, Rach.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.643
And once again,
she is out of here!

17:00.853 --> 17:03.354
Okay, who had 9:45? Hm?

17:10.738 --> 17:12.195
Heh.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.829
You know what, Bar?
I'm not gonna leave.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.249
I probably should, but I'm not.

17:23.459 --> 17:27.795
I promised myself I'd make it
through at least one of your weddings.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.845
Tonight, all I wanted was
to make it through this evening...

17:36.430 --> 17:40.308
...with a little bit of grace
and dignity.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.687
Well, I guess we can all agree
that's not gonna happen.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.943
I guess there's nothing
really left to say...

17:51.862 --> 17:53.237
...except...

17:59.369 --> 18:00.953
Her name was Lola

18:02.623 --> 18:05.541
She was a showgirl

18:07.419 --> 18:09.378
With yellow feath...

18:09.588 --> 18:11.422
Feathers in her hair

18:11.673 --> 18:14.675
And a dress cut down to there

18:14.885 --> 18:16.427
She would...

18:16.678 --> 18:17.887
Merengue
- Merengue

18:18.055 --> 18:19.263
Thank you, honey.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.016
And do the cha-cha

18:22.226 --> 18:26.854
And while she'd like to be a star
Tony always tended bar

18:27.106 --> 18:28.147
Wait, wait!

18:28.357 --> 18:29.732
Everybody!

18:29.942 --> 18:31.359
Copa

18:31.527 --> 18:32.902
Copacabana

18:33.654 --> 18:36.823
The hottest spot north of Havana

18:37.074 --> 18:38.366
At the Copa

18:38.992 --> 18:40.993
Copacabana

18:41.495 --> 18:46.249
Music and passion were always
In fashion at the Copa

18:49.545 --> 18:52.130
There's a somebody I'm longing...

18:52.297 --> 18:53.631
Okay.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.591
I'll do it.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.260
You'll do what?

18:57.511 --> 19:00.263
If kids is what it takes to be with you,
then kids it is.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.682
Oh, my God.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.393
If I have to,
I'll do it all again.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.854
I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.981
I'll go to the PTA meetings.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.108
I'll coach the soccer team.

19:13.068 --> 19:15.403
- Really?
- Yeah, if I have to.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.905
Monica...

19:20.701 --> 19:22.702
...I don't wanna lose you.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.497
So if I have to do it all again...

19:26.707 --> 19:28.124
...then I will.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.838
You are the most wonderful man.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.758
And if you hadn't have said...

19:38.010 --> 19:41.679
..."If I have to," like, 17 times...

19:42.806 --> 19:45.224
...then I'd be saying, "Okay, let's do it."

19:47.561 --> 19:48.895
But you're not.

19:51.565 --> 19:56.277
Oh, my God. I can't believe
what I'm getting ready to say.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.533
I wanna have a baby.

20:05.704 --> 20:09.749
But I don't want to have one with
someone who doesn't really want to have one.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.628
God.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.010
I love you.

20:25.849 --> 20:27.767
I know you do.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.938
Me too.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.696
So what now?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.659
I guess we just...

20:45.535 --> 20:47.203
...keep dancing.

20:47.663 --> 20:53.793
Someone to watch

20:54.127 --> 20:56.379
Over me

21:01.843 --> 21:03.719
Where is she? Where is she?

21:03.929 --> 21:05.554
Oh, hey, I have a question.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.806
Where is she?

21:06.974 --> 21:10.101
Chandler. Relax, Chandler.
She'll be here.

21:12.020 --> 21:14.146
Oh, oh, oh. That's her.

21:14.690 --> 21:17.817
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.528
You gotta stop staring at the door...

21:20.779 --> 21:22.029
...like a watched pot.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.366
If you keep looking at it,
the door's never gonna boil.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.662
I think what you have to do
is try not to...

21:35.335 --> 21:37.044
Oh, my God.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.007
Oh...

21:41.675 --> 21:43.050
...my...

21:43.510 --> 21:44.927
...God.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.229
Oh...

21:55.439 --> 21:56.439
...my...

21:56.690 --> 21:57.940
...God.

22:06.366 --> 22:07.533
All right.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.370
I've been feeling incredibly guilty
because I wanna be a good friend.

22:11.580 --> 22:15.458
And damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and close your eyes.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.379
Wow.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.591
You are a good friend.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.177
The audition was this morning,
and I didn't get it.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.514
But that was a hell of a kiss.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.808
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
