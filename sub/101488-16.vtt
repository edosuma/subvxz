00:21.896 --> 00:24.024
<i>Hi, journal.</i>
<i>Nothing interesting to report.</i>

00:24.107 --> 00:25.900
<i>Just another rainy spring day.</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:27.527
<i>Isn't spring supposed to be</i>
<i>full of promise</i>

00:27.610 --> 00:28.695
<i>and new growth and crap like that?</i>

00:28.778 --> 00:30.363
<i>It's giving me nothing.</i>

00:30.447 --> 00:31.948
<i>The most exciting thing</i>
<i>that's happened to me lately</i>

00:32.032 --> 00:33.783
<i>is when I thought we got a new bar of soap</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:35.201
<i>in the kitchen,</i>
<i>but it was a peeled potato.</i>

00:35.285 --> 00:36.578
(excitedly): Oh.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.996
(disappointed): Oh.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.622
<i>Didn't get my hands clean at all.</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:41.416
Don't even think that.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.752
Ah, the school fair's
not getting rained out.

00:43.835 --> 00:46.504
Scott Baggs just said
the clouds will lift by Friday.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.256
By the way, thank you so much

00:48.340 --> 00:50.342
for assigning us to a booth this year.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.635
It's been three straight years
of cleanup committee.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.429
So, what'd we get? What'd we get?

00:54.512 --> 00:55.930
Oh. Huh.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.807
Well, it's no temporary tattoo booth,

00:57.891 --> 00:59.142
but I guess it's something.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.477
All right, bye.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.979
So, we're running a booth this year?
Which one?

01:03.063 --> 01:04.731
-Water.
-There's a water booth?

01:04.814 --> 01:07.275
We finally get to run a booth,
and it's the lamest one.

01:07.359 --> 01:08.985
Well, at least you kids could hang out

01:09.069 --> 01:10.320
at the water booth with Mommy.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.447
Oh... that sounds fun.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.576
Aw, Tina, I hate seeing you like this,

01:16.659 --> 01:18.203
all poopy and droopy.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.705
Here, now you don't have to see me.
(grunts)

01:20.789 --> 01:23.875
You're gonna be okay.
You're just in a bit of a funk.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.878
I believe she's suffering
from a case of moody-teen-itis.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.797
She's got to get her teen-itis booster.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.841
TINA:
Is this funk ever gonna go away?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.259
I mean, it's spring.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.303
It's supposed to be
a time of change, adventure.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.180
-Hay fever.
-Taxes.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.183
Hot spring flings where you
roll around in blooming flowers.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.227
-Getting grass stains everywhere.
-BOB: Hmm.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.230
Well, you could be excited
about the school's spring fair.

01:45.313 --> 01:48.400
Yeah, T, school fair equals
dunk Mr. Frond in the dunk tank.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.360
-I guess there's that.
-Exactly.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.570
The fair will get you
out of the "doll-drums."

01:52.654 --> 01:54.197
Pretty sure it's "doldrums," Lin.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.157
No, "doll-drums."

01:56.241 --> 01:59.077
Sad little dolls playing
with their sad little drums.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.037
-Aw.
-Yup, right, never mind.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.667
Man, Tina's losing a lot of air.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.377
Do we still have her patch kit?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.879
Tina, just imagine the look
on Mr. Frond's dumb face

02:09.963 --> 02:11.506
when one of us finally knocks him

02:11.589 --> 02:13.133
into the dunk tank at the fair.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.051
I mean, we've never been able to do it,

02:15.135 --> 02:17.637
so I feel like imagining it is
the closest we're gonna get?

02:17.721 --> 02:19.347
Nuh-uh.
This is gonna be our year,

02:19.431 --> 02:21.307
'cause this year, we're gonna practice.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.435
Practice?
That doesn't sound like us.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.936
I found out the dunk tank is

02:25.020 --> 02:26.479
getting delivered to the school today.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.898
So, for the next three days
at lunch recess,

02:28.982 --> 02:31.985
I propose we sneak on over
to the dunk tank and practice.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.445
I'll build some upper body strength,

02:33.528 --> 02:35.405
Tina's gonna tame that wild arm of hers,

02:35.488 --> 02:37.073
and Gene's gonna get a handle

02:37.157 --> 02:38.867
on his possibly too complicated windup.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.578
It's less of a windup and more
of an interpretive dance.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.956
And then on Friday, one of us
will finally dunk Mr. Frond,

02:45.040 --> 02:46.958
into a pool of his own tears.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.169
And mysteriously cloudy tank water.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.713
This week, we're the Three Dunkateers.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.007
Come on, dukes in.
Dunk our guidance counselor!

02:54.090 --> 02:55.383
ALL:
Dunk our guidance counselor!

02:55.467 --> 02:56.634
Actually, imagining all this

02:56.718 --> 02:57.969
sort of is making me feel better.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.598
You guys go ahead.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.849
I'll just live here.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.226
"Red dress."
Jocelyn?

03:05.310 --> 03:08.021
<i>Rojo...</i> dress-o?

03:08.104 --> 03:09.314
<i>Vestido rojo.</i>

03:09.397 --> 03:10.815
That's what I said.

03:10.899 --> 03:14.986
Jimmy Jr., how do we say
"green bicycle" in <i>español?</i>

03:15.070 --> 03:17.238
<i>Bicicleta verde?</i>

03:17.322 --> 03:18.490
Super.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.241
"Orange scarf," Tina.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.701
Tina... Tina!

03:21.785 --> 03:22.869
Huh? Wh-What?

03:22.952 --> 03:24.079
"Orange scarf."

03:24.162 --> 03:26.581
Oh, sorry.
Um, pass?

03:26.664 --> 03:27.916
<i>Bufanda naranja.</i>

03:27.999 --> 03:29.250
Yep, uh, that sounds right.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.627
-Good job.
-(bell rings)

03:30.710 --> 03:32.796
<i>Adiós, estudiantes.</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:34.339
<i>Tina, un momento, por favor.</i>

03:34.422 --> 03:35.548
I don't know what you said,

03:35.632 --> 03:37.175
but you're looking at me
like I shouldn't go.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.593
Now, I may have only received

03:38.677 --> 03:40.720
my Spanish accreditation last semester,

03:40.804 --> 03:44.015
but I know a <i>perro cuya cola</i>
<i>no se mueve</i> when I see one.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.101
A purple couch?

03:46.184 --> 03:48.478
No, it means
a dog whose tail does not wag.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.896
So what's up, <i>amiga?</i>

03:49.979 --> 03:51.898
Do you ever just feel like
every day is the same

03:51.981 --> 03:53.441
and nothing new ever happens?

03:53.525 --> 03:56.152
Well, not since I joined
the Applesauce of the Month Club.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.279
But, Tina, you've got to get it together,

03:58.363 --> 04:00.782
because your last couple
of quizzes have been caca, okay?

04:00.865 --> 04:02.659
So I signed you up for the language lab.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.119
Wagstaff has a language lab?

04:04.202 --> 04:06.454
Well, we have cassette tapes
on a shelf in the library

04:06.538 --> 04:08.623
that someone donated in the 1980s.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.667
It's really more of a language shelf.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.460
Okay, so what do I have to do?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.087
You'll practice with the Spanish tape

04:14.170 --> 04:15.797
this week during after-lunch break.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.215
Oh, man.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.717
<i>En español,</i> please.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.885
Oh, uh... oh, <i>hombre.</i>

04:20.969 --> 04:23.054
Pass the weekly quiz on Thursday,

04:23.138 --> 04:24.973
and you'll get
your after-lunch break back.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.017
<i>Bueno.</i>
This is just <i>bueno.</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:29.436
So, right after I eat, I got to go to

04:29.519 --> 04:31.187
the el stupido library
and work on Spanish.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.106
So I guess you'll just
have to practice without me.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.066
See?
This is why I hate school.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.985
It gets in the way
of really important things

04:37.068 --> 04:39.154
like humiliating Mr. Frond
in the dunk tank.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.155
Sorry, guys.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.781
Ugh, but you're our best shot.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.367
You at least throw hard,
with your raw pube power.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.287
Raw pube power is what got us to the moon.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.331
Well, well, well, look who
we have here-- the Belchers.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.334
The school fair's coming up.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.336
Please tell me you're gonna
waste all your tickets again

04:54.419 --> 04:56.296
on trying to knock me into the dunk tank.

04:56.379 --> 04:57.881
It would make me so happy.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.591
Not all our tickets.
I'll need three

04:59.674 --> 05:01.634
for the snow cone booth, minimum.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.928
They're not gonna be wasted.
We're gonna waste you.

05:04.012 --> 05:07.015
You're never getting this wet.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.558
Ne-ver.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.226
-Huh!
-Aah!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.562
Mr. Ambrose, can you tell me where...

05:12.645 --> 05:13.480
-Shh!
-What?

05:13.563 --> 05:14.856
Oh, sorry, that's just a reflex.

05:14.939 --> 05:18.818
Okay, um, can you tell me
where the language lab shelf is?

05:18.902 --> 05:20.653
Far corner, next to the window.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.072
Okay, thank you, Mr. Am...

05:22.155 --> 05:23.448
Oh, my God, are we still talking?

05:23.531 --> 05:26.201
(sighs)
Let's get this over with.

05:26.284 --> 05:29.412
<i>NARRATOR (on tape): Welcome to</i>
<i>"Pack Your Bags," Spain Edition.</i>

05:29.496 --> 05:32.457
<i>Are you ready to pack your bags</i>
<i>and head to Spain?</i>

05:32.540 --> 05:34.209
This is a Spain in the butt.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.128
<i>Great.</i>
<i>Now let's meet your host family.</i>

05:37.212 --> 05:38.797
<i>And try to respond in Spanish.</i>

05:38.880 --> 05:40.882
<i>Meet Señor Balthazar.</i>

05:40.965 --> 05:42.967
-SEÑOR BALTHAZAR: Hola.
<i>-Hola.</i>

05:43.051 --> 05:46.262
<i>NARRATOR: Now say hello to his wife,</i>
<i>Señora Balthazar.</i>

05:46.346 --> 05:48.264
-SEÑORA BALTHAZAR: Hola.
<i>-Hola.</i>

05:48.348 --> 05:50.517
<i>NARRATOR: And meet their two children,</i>
<i>seven-year-old Maria...</i>

05:50.600 --> 05:52.268
-MARIA: Hola.
-TINA: <i>Hola.</i>

05:52.352 --> 05:54.688
<i>NARRATOR:</i>
<i>...and 15-year-old Rodrigo.</i>

05:54.771 --> 05:56.981
-RODRIGO: Hola.
<i>-Hola, Rodrigo.</i>

05:57.065 --> 05:59.442
<i>NARRATOR: Your first practice conversation</i>
<i>will be with Rodrigo.</i>

05:59.526 --> 06:00.819
Okay.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.362
RODRIGO:
Hola. Me llamo Rodrigo.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.655
¿Como te llamas?

06:03.738 --> 06:05.031
<i>Hello.</i>
<i>My name is Rodrigo.</i>

06:05.115 --> 06:06.116
<i>What is your name?</i>

06:06.199 --> 06:08.576
Tina.
I mean, <i>me llamo Tina.</i>

06:08.660 --> 06:09.994
RODRIGO:
¿Cuantos años tienes?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.162
<i>How old are you?</i>

06:11.246 --> 06:13.331
I'm... <i>diez, once, doce, trece...</i>

06:13.415 --> 06:15.417
I'm <i>trece años.</i>

06:15.500 --> 06:18.378
Just two little years
younger than you, Rodrigo.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.089
RODRIGO: Estoy emocionado que te estás
quedando con nosotros.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.049
<i>I am excited that you're staying with us.</i>

06:23.133 --> 06:27.053
Um, <i>estoy emocionado</i>
to be staying with you, Rodrigo.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.682
RODRIGO: Vamos. Te mostraré la plaza
y te compraré una paleta.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.726
Something about if I'm single?

06:32.809 --> 06:35.937
<i>Come. I will show you the plaza</i>
<i>and buy you a Popsicle.</i>

06:36.021 --> 06:38.356
Oh, just you and me?
Okay.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.567
<i>Muchas gracias, Rodrigo.</i>

06:40.650 --> 06:42.986
<i>-Hace calor.</i> It is hot out.
-Yeah, it is.

06:43.069 --> 06:46.781
Oops. <i>Mi paleta se derritio</i>
<i>sobre mi camisa.</i>

06:46.865 --> 06:48.742
My Popsicle dripped onto my shirt.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.078
Sure did. And a little
got on your chest. Oh, wow.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.080
Look, Rodrigo, I mean, I know we just met

06:54.164 --> 06:55.790
and you're just a voice on a tape,

06:55.874 --> 06:57.500
but you're feeling this, too, right?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.252
<i>Vamos a caminar por la plaza.</i>

06:59.336 --> 07:01.338
Come, let's take a walk around the plaza.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.007
I'm so "plazzed" you asked.
(chuckles)

07:04.090 --> 07:07.093
Rodrigo, you just turned
my blahs into ooh-la-las.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.553
That's French.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.221
Oh, right.
(sighs)

07:14.809 --> 07:16.811
That's so great you guys finally get

07:16.895 --> 07:18.021
to run a booth at the school fair.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.898
Who cares if it's just the water booth?

07:19.981 --> 07:22.359
I mean, I don't drink the stuff,
but I've heard good things.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.319
Well, I'm gonna turn the water booth

07:24.402 --> 07:26.571
into "what a cool booth."

07:26.654 --> 07:29.449
-And how are you gonna do that?
-Like this.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.658
BOB:
It says "rad."

07:30.742 --> 07:32.994
-Oh, that's cool.
-Yeah.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.746
-"Rockin'."
-Mm... (chuckles)

07:34.829 --> 07:37.123
-Super very cool.
-This one says "skateboard."

07:37.207 --> 07:38.708
Yeah, dude.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.335
A kid can't drink water out of that

07:40.418 --> 07:42.879
-and not feel cool, huh?
-(Tina sighs)

07:42.962 --> 07:44.547
Someone's feeling better.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.841
Yeah, she's been cleaning
that one spot for, like,

07:46.925 --> 07:48.093
-half an hour.
-(Tina humming a tune)

07:49.469 --> 07:51.763
Tina, you snapped out of your funk, huh?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.598
Funk yeah, I did.
(sighs)

07:53.682 --> 07:56.726
(gasps)
Wait, I recognize that sigh.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.062
You're having a spring fling.
Who is it?

08:01.356 --> 08:02.524
(whispers):
Popsicle.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.276
No. (chuckles)
No spring fling for me.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.445
Okay, Little Miss Dreamy Droolin' Face.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.114
There actually is a little drool.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.740
Me? Oh, her.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.243
Well, whatever it is,
I'm just glad you're out of the dumps.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.621
Uh, me, too, but maybe
don't do that with the broom?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.707
It's just... you know, get a room.

08:18.790 --> 08:19.958
A broom room.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.334
-To make boom-boom.
-Gene.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.713
Hey, I know your name's Duncan,

08:24.796 --> 08:27.215
but you're not gonna be dunkin' this guy.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.591
Okay.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.260
Ugh. Frond.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.594
Lunchtime.
Come on.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.596
Let's hit the slop line
and chow down real fast

08:33.680 --> 08:35.765
so we can squeeze in a bit
of you-know-what practice.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.018
-What?
-The dunk tank? Hello.

08:38.101 --> 08:40.353
Right, yeah, dunking.
Dunk tank.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.147
Young lady, are you huffing glue?

08:42.230 --> 08:44.274
-No, it's just I already ate.
-You did?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.818
Yeah, I packed a lunch
and snuck bites during social studies.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.403
Tuna time.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.698
So I could spend the whole lunchtime

08:51.781 --> 08:54.159
listening to that
totally dumb Spanish tape.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.662
Cram today so I pass
the quiz tomorrow. (chuckles)

08:57.746 --> 08:59.539
-Okay...
-But it's corn dog day.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.332
That only happens once a week.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.626
<i>NARRATOR (on tape):</i>
<i>In lesson six,</i>

09:03.710 --> 09:06.212
<i>Maria will teach you</i>
<i>how to play hopscotch.</i>

09:06.296 --> 09:08.423
<i>¿Quieres jugar brinca-scotch?</i>

09:08.506 --> 09:10.175
-Nope.
-(tape fast-forwarding)

09:10.258 --> 09:12.510
-And that's how you make flan.
-(singsongy): Rodrigo...

09:12.594 --> 09:14.763
<i>¿dónde está?</i>

09:14.846 --> 09:16.765
A picnic in the park?
<i>Sí.</i>

09:16.848 --> 09:18.391
<i>¿Te gusta el pan con queso?</i>

09:18.475 --> 09:19.851
<i>Me gusta</i> cheese and bread.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.479
And I think <i>me gusta</i> you, Rodrigo.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.148
<i>Yo te enseñare como jugar con el Frisbee.</i>

09:25.231 --> 09:27.609
I will show you how to play
with the Frisbee.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.610
Oh, oh, okay.

09:28.693 --> 09:29.944
<i>Si lo liberas aquí,</i>

09:30.028 --> 09:31.654
<i>se irá a la izquierda.</i>

09:31.738 --> 09:33.990
If you release it here, it'll go left.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.493
<i>Izquierda,</i> left, yep.
So, about what I was saying...

09:36.576 --> 09:39.454
<i>Si lo liberas aquí, se irá a la derecha.</i>

09:39.537 --> 09:41.748
If you release it here, it'll go right.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.001
<i>Derecha,</i> right, got it.
Um, about how <i>me gusta</i> you...

09:45.085 --> 09:48.380
<i>Para que se vaya recto,</i>
<i>debes apuntar recto.</i>

09:48.463 --> 09:50.715
To go straight, you must point straight.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.133
<i>Recto,</i> straight, got it.

09:52.217 --> 09:54.010
Look, I know I'm only
in <i>España</i> for the week,

09:54.094 --> 09:55.720
but I feel like we've really connected.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.014
<i>Iré a buscarlo.</i>
I will go get it.

09:58.098 --> 10:01.893
I hate to see you <i>vamos,</i>
but I love to watch you <i>vamos.</i>

10:03.395 --> 10:05.522
Ah... blammo!

10:06.856 --> 10:08.983
-Better. Better.
-I know, right?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.985
Hey, do you think
Tina's acting kind of weird?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.570
I mean, weirder than normal?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.114
Yeah, she missed corn dog day.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.199
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around that.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.160
Maybe Mom was right.
Maybe it is new-boy related.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.788
(gasps) And maybe that boy
is also studying

10:21.871 --> 10:23.373
in the library at lunchtime.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.749
Worst date ever.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.210
Let's go see if Tina's
having a librar-affair.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.212
Hmm.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.298
Mr. Ambrose, have you seen
our sister Tina with a boy in here?

10:32.382 --> 10:35.010
Being all teenager-y, swapping hormones?

10:35.093 --> 10:36.261
Ew, gross.
No.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.513
Tina studies alone in the language lab.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.806
-And where is the...
-Ugh!

10:39.889 --> 10:41.516
Far corner, near the window.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.645
TINA:
Rodrigo, you.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.272
Rodrigo?

10:47.355 --> 10:49.024
I don't know how this works,

10:49.107 --> 10:51.109
but I'm ready for a kiss, <i>un beso.</i>

10:51.192 --> 10:53.528
Maybe we could incorporate
that into the lesson?

10:53.611 --> 10:56.448
<i>Tu te acuerdas cómo</i>
<i>conjugar el verbo "caminar"?</i>

10:56.531 --> 10:59.409
Do you remember how to conjugate
the verb "to walk"?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.120
-Are we doing this?
<i>-LOUISE: Tina?</i>

11:02.203 --> 11:03.538
This is why you missed our after-lunch

11:03.621 --> 11:05.040
break time practice time?

11:05.123 --> 11:07.959
Do you have the hots for a boy
on your language tape?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.711
-No.
-Then why were you a making a kissy-face

11:09.794 --> 11:11.421
and saying all that stuff?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.257
It's, uh, it's gonna be on the test?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.845
I can't believe
you're in love with the boy

11:18.928 --> 11:21.765
-on your Spanish tape.
-I can. Rodrigo seems amazing.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.725
And his mom's paella sounds delicious.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.435
Look, guys, I know
he's just a voice on a tape.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.187
And I'm not in love with Rodrigo.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.022
We're just hanging out,
seeing where it goes.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.940
Uh-huh. Sure.
Super normal.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.360
Tina, what's the plan here?
How does this end?

11:33.443 --> 11:36.446
Are you gonna run off with Rodrigo?
I get your room.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.615
No, it's just, I was in a funk
and now I'm not in a funk,

11:38.698 --> 11:40.241
and that's 'cause of Rodrigo.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.535
So I want to keep
being non-funky with Rodrigo.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.579
Look, I'm glad you're feeling
better, and who cares

11:44.662 --> 11:46.081
if it was some boy's voice on a tape?

11:46.164 --> 11:48.416
Velvety voice, I assume.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.669
<i>-Muy</i> velvety.
-The point is, you're back.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.629
After you pass your Spanish quiz tomorrow,

11:52.712 --> 11:54.381
then we can focus on the Dunkateers.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.466
(sighs) I guess you're right.
Dang it.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.759
He said he was gonna take me to the beach

11:57.842 --> 11:58.968
in lesson ten tomorrow.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.679
-But like, not really.
-I know.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.097
It's just, this language immersion

12:02.180 --> 12:03.598
can be very immersiony.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.975
Seems like Rodrigo
is a sloppy Popsicle eater, huh?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.395
Oh, yeah.
(chuckles)

12:08.478 --> 12:09.813
LINDA:
Hey.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.314
I found your old baseball hat.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.191
-Uh, yep, there it is.
-Put it on.

12:13.274 --> 12:16.111
-Okay. Why?
-Put it on backwards.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.781
-Um, no.
-Turn it, flip it, do it.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.991
-Yeah, Bob, turn it backwards.
-It'll look cool.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.868
I don't want to do it.
Stop pressuring me.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.829
I-I'll do it with mine.
See?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.497
Oh. Still, huh?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.125
-Yeah. Very cool.
-Super cool.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.128
Hey, maybe you could, I don't know,

12:33.211 --> 12:36.006
-wear it like that to the school fair.
-That's a great idea.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.216
Lin, we don't need
to try and make our booth seem cool.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.051
We just need to give people water.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.179
Besides, I-I don't think
there are cool booths at this thing.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.432
Oh, really?
There's a booth that has goldfish.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.642
You give them tickets
and you can win a goldfish.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.102
A live goldfish.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.645
-To eat?
-Whatever you want.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.230
-So cool.
-Oh, my God.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.648
GRANT:
Buenos días,

12:53.732 --> 12:54.941
<i>estudiantes.</i>

12:55.025 --> 12:56.901
<i>Buenos días, Señor Grant.</i>

12:56.985 --> 13:00.071
So, Tina, are you ready
for the quiz today?

13:00.155 --> 13:01.906
<i>La paella contiene azafrán?</i>

13:01.990 --> 13:05.243
"Does paella contain saffron?"
Yes, it does.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.746
Someone's immersion course is working.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.664
And that someone is <i>yo.</i>

13:09.748 --> 13:11.541
And good thing, too, 'cause Jacob Weber

13:11.624 --> 13:14.252
needs that Spanish tape, like, yesterday.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.087
He's been out of school
with that broken tailbone

13:16.171 --> 13:18.381
and now he's behind.
Ha.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.175
<i>TINA:</i>
<i>"Translate the following:</i>

13:20.258 --> 13:21.926
<i>I saw a little brown dog in the park."</i>

13:22.010 --> 13:26.014
"Vi un perrito moreno
en el parque." Aw, parque.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.932
<i>That's where Rodrigo taught me</i>
<i>my right from my left.</i>

13:28.016 --> 13:29.559
<i>And how to feel alive again.</i>

13:29.642 --> 13:30.769
<i>Oh, man, I don't know if I'm ready</i>

13:30.852 --> 13:32.062
<i>to say</i> adiós <i>to Rodrigo.</i>

13:32.145 --> 13:33.688
<i>There's so much more he can teach me.</i>

13:33.772 --> 13:35.857
<i>And we almost got into</i>
<i>some serious beso-ing.</i>

13:35.940 --> 13:37.442
<i>Ah! But as soon as I pass this quiz,</i>

13:37.525 --> 13:40.153
<i>Jacob Weber will move in</i>
<i>with</i> la familia Baltazar.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.654
<i>Unless...</i>

13:41.738 --> 13:44.491
All right, it's the last day
for dunk tank practice

13:44.574 --> 13:47.577
and we finally have all Three Dunkateers.
Shall we?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.371
Actually, I can't.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.623
I, um, flunked my Spanish quiz.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.083
Got to stick with the old language lab

13:53.166 --> 13:55.001
during my lunchtimes.
(tongue clicks) Darn it.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.504
-Seriously?
-(sighs) See for yourself.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.673
But we've heard you,
your Spanish has gotten way better.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.133
And so has your skin.
Are you exfoliating?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.636
Hey, I'm as P.O.ed about this as you guys.

14:04.719 --> 14:08.181
-Ugh, it's the worst.
-You got, like, every question wrong.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.433
Hold on a sec.
You erased this answer

14:10.517 --> 14:11.643
and wrote something else.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.353
And this one, and this one.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.689
Tina, did you purposely flunk this quiz

14:15.772 --> 14:18.483
-so you don't have to stop
listening to Rodrigo? -(gasps)

14:18.566 --> 14:19.901
What? No?
(scoffs)

14:19.984 --> 14:21.069
You're choosing Rodrigo

14:21.152 --> 14:22.445
over the Three Dunkateers?

14:22.529 --> 14:25.448
Ugh, I can't believe you.
Rodrigo is not real.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.660
What are you gonna do, marry him
and have his not-real babies?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.453
I don't want to be a not-real uncle.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.663
I'm not-real ready.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.997
I know Rodrigo's not real.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.666
But the way he makes me feel is real.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.501
It's not real.
It's a tape.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.794
From before you were born.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.379
Well, it's more real than our chance

14:39.462 --> 14:41.047
of actually hitting that dunk tank target.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.008
-What did you just say?
-Uh-oh.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.759
Face it, Louise, none of us
are good enough throwers

14:44.843 --> 14:47.053
-to dunk Mr. Frond.
-(laughs): Wow. Okay.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.930
Well, if that's the way you feel,

14:49.014 --> 14:50.932
maybe you shouldn't
go to the fair tomorrow.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.934
Fine. Maybe I'll just stay
in the library during the fair

14:53.018 --> 14:55.353
and Rodrigo and I can
throw the Frisbee at the frickin' <i>playa.</i>

14:55.437 --> 14:57.856
Fine. Gene and I will
dunk Frond without you.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.316
But we'll be the Two Dunkateers
because it wouldn't make sense

15:00.400 --> 15:02.902
to be the Three Dunkateers
with only two people.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.071
No, I totally get the need
for the name change!

15:05.155 --> 15:08.158
Why don't you Rodri-go-on
and get out of here?

15:08.241 --> 15:09.576
Okay, I will.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.828
<i>-Hermana, hermano.</i>
-Ugh.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.456
Are we really losing our sister
to some Frisbee-throwing,

15:14.539 --> 15:16.624
Popsicle-eating boy on a cassette?

15:16.708 --> 15:19.377
Seems like it.
We always knew it would end this way.

15:19.461 --> 15:20.920
Gene, we got to do something.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.256
-How? She won't listen to us.
-Huh.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.633
I've got an idea
how we can get through to Tina.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.469
Slap her and say, "Snap out of it"?

15:27.552 --> 15:28.762
It worked for Cher.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.767
LINDA:
Water here.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.268
Get your water from what some people

15:35.352 --> 15:37.771
are calling the coolest booth at the fair.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.439
Bob, make sure all the cups
are facing out,

15:39.522 --> 15:41.649
so the kids can see all
the cool words I wrote on them.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.360
Mm-hmm, cups are facing out.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.779
Well, we're bringing it.
Ball's in their court.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.280
Hey, why aren't you wearing the hat?

15:47.364 --> 15:49.240
Oh, so I'm actually doing that?

15:49.324 --> 15:50.533
Put it on.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.160
Now put on the fingerless gloves.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.453
-I'm not doing that.
-(groans)

15:53.536 --> 15:54.996
And you wouldn't let me pierce your ear.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.664
You got to work with me here, Bob.

15:56.748 --> 16:01.002
Peter Pescadero didn't dunk me?
Shocker.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.837
Oh, you gonna cry about it?
Next.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.048
Seth Feldman?
Oh.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.550
With those little twig arms,
you couldn't dunk a breadstick.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.011
Mr. Frond has turned into
a real dunk punk.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.013
Ugh, I want to dunk him so bad.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.141
So, Tina should be in the library by now.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.060
Let's just hope our totally
slapped-together plan

16:17.143 --> 16:18.311
does the trick.

16:18.395 --> 16:20.647
Well, Rodrigo, let's hit <i>la playa.</i>

16:20.730 --> 16:22.190
<i>¿Tienes tu traje de baño?</i>

16:22.273 --> 16:23.692
Do you have your bathing suit?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.860
<i>Traje de baño, sí.</i>

16:25.944 --> 16:28.488
<i>Tus lentes de sol?</i>
Your sunglasses?

16:28.571 --> 16:30.532
<i>Lentes de sol, sí.</i>

16:30.615 --> 16:33.201
<i>Y tu aceite bronceador?</i>
And your suntan oil?

16:33.284 --> 16:36.788
<i>Sí. Mucho, mucho aceite bronceador.</i>

16:36.871 --> 16:38.039
<i>LOUISE:</i>
<i>In the next lesson,</i>

16:38.123 --> 16:39.749
<i>look out the window of the library...</i>

16:39.833 --> 16:41.251
-What the...?
<i>-...and notice your brother</i>

16:41.334 --> 16:43.003
<i>and sister near the dunk tank.</i>

16:43.086 --> 16:45.255
<i>How do you say, "I bailed on my siblings</i>

16:45.338 --> 16:47.507
<i>for a voice on a tape" in Spanish?</i>

16:47.590 --> 16:50.343
What's Louise doing on here?
What did she do?

16:50.427 --> 16:51.928
(sighs)
Fast-forwarding.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.264
<i>Los plátanos se ven maduros.</i>

16:54.347 --> 16:57.475
-The bananas look ripe.
-Such ripe <i>plátanos.</i>

16:57.559 --> 16:59.394
<i>Y también las uvas.</i>

16:59.477 --> 17:01.604
-So do the grapes.
<i>-Uvas.</i>

17:01.688 --> 17:03.940
Hey, Rodrigo, it's me,
your American friend.

17:04.024 --> 17:06.234
I'm gonna hang out with you guys all day.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.945
Here, let me stand
in between you two and sing.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.533
Oh, come on.
Fast-forwarding.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.534
<i>Más queso?</i>

17:14.617 --> 17:15.702
<i>Sí,</i> I'll take some more cheese.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.787
-Oh, no, an alligator
-(Rodrigo screams)

17:17.871 --> 17:19.205
is eating Rodrigo and he died.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.374
-That's so sad.
-(yells)

17:21.458 --> 17:24.419
Hey, sorry about Rodrigo,
but he lived a full life.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.338
So healthy, lot of fruit.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.547
So, look Tina,

17:27.630 --> 17:29.799
uh, Gene wanted me to tell you something,

17:29.883 --> 17:33.386
and it's that he really,
really wants you to be at the fair.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.972
Because even if somehow
Gene and I miraculously dunk Frond,

17:36.056 --> 17:39.267
it won't matter 'cause
you weren't there to see it.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.644
I don't know, it was
just something Gene said.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.357
-You think it's working?
-Can't tell.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.900
Should we give her the finger or...?

17:46.983 --> 17:48.318
LOUISE:
Crap.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403
-FROND: Next.
-That's us.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.863
All right, these tickets represent

17:51.946 --> 17:53.531
all the money we have in the world.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.534
And all the change we found
under Dad's seat in the car.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.495
(laughs):
Oh.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.997
Well, the Belchers.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.624
Can somebody hand me my phone?

18:02.707 --> 18:03.833
I'm gonna read my e-mails,

18:03.917 --> 18:05.543
'cause there's literally no chance

18:05.627 --> 18:07.128
of going in the water right now.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.838
And I definitely have e-mails.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.841
I sent you a recipe
for the ultimate cinnamon rolls.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.594
-Gene, uh, you go first.
-Okay.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.223
(grunts)
Ow.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.432
Did I do it?

18:19.516 --> 18:21.685
You know what?
I'm gonna do my taxes.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.853
Mr. Branca, will you hand me
that manila folder?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.105
It's okay, we got lots of tickets,

18:25.188 --> 18:27.107
and we've been practicing.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.442
We just got to hit that target once.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.293
Hey, at least you didn't use
up all your tickets.

18:47.377 --> 18:49.838
Oh, wait, you did.
Womp-womp.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.548
We still have one ticket left.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.675
Save it for a snow cone.
Next.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.093
Mind if I use that ticket?

18:55.176 --> 18:56.511
-Tina.
-You're here.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.263
Yeah, I realized I'd rather be here

18:58.346 --> 19:00.348
with my two real siblings than on a <i>playa</i>

19:00.432 --> 19:02.809
with one super-hot, not totally real

19:02.892 --> 19:05.061
but also sensitive Spanish teenage boy.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.230
-You sure you'd rather be here?
-I'm 90% sure.

19:07.313 --> 19:12.110
Will one of you Belchers hurry
up and throw your turn away?

19:12.193 --> 19:14.154
Come on, T.
You're our last hope.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.780
I believe in you.
Just use your arm

19:15.864 --> 19:17.407
-to throw the ball.
-(exhales)

19:17.490 --> 19:19.993
Mr. Branca, get me my new laptop.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.413
-Mr. Frond, no.
-Get it.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.582
-You got this.
-RODRIGO: Sí, es verdad.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.335
Yes, it's true.
Your arm is wild,

19:28.418 --> 19:29.961
like your heart.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.547
<i>Pero debes apuntar derecho</i>
<i>cuando lo sueltes.</i>

19:32.630 --> 19:36.176
You must point straight when you release.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.345
You might want to put your phone
somewhere dry, Mr. Frond.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.597
-Is that so?
-(grunts)

19:44.517 --> 19:46.269
(slow-motion):
No!

19:50.023 --> 19:52.108
Oh, no. Help!
My phone is drowning!

19:52.192 --> 19:54.194
Yes, yes, yes!
An adult is wet.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.321
Why is this so satisfying?

19:56.404 --> 19:58.406
Dukes in, Three Dunkateers.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.076
Now let's eat snow cones like champions.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.870
-Aren't we out of tickets?
-That's what your babysitting money's for.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.789
Oh, I give up.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.957
There's no way
to make the water booth cool.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.834
Stupid water.
I hate you.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.837
No, there's not.
But maybe that's okay?

20:12.921 --> 20:14.547
I mean, water's water.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.175
It's better than cool?
We need it to live?

20:17.258 --> 20:19.052
-All right, <i>Planet Earth.</i>
-Whoa.

20:19.135 --> 20:21.971
Um, I think you're all at the wrong booth?

20:22.055 --> 20:25.433
We had chili at the chili booth
and it was so spicy.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.769
Way too spicy.
(shouts)

20:27.852 --> 20:29.521
Let me have another one.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.107
This water's so good.
It's so cold.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.317
-(gasps) He said cool.
-He said "cold," but...

20:34.401 --> 20:37.028
Yay, spicy chili.
Bob, we win.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.863
-We do?
-Look at all these kids.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.116
Why does my cup
have a cigarette drawn on it?

20:41.199 --> 20:42.826
-Linda.
-Here, here, never mind that.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.911
Let me give you another one.
Yay, up top.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.496
Oh, you want water.
Okay, here you go.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.206
-TINA: Wow.
-Is there a waiting list

20:48.289 --> 20:50.375
-to get a cup of water?
-Hi, kids.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.585
Check us out.
We're the cool booth now.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.213
Eh, let the woman have it.
Way to go, Mom!

20:55.296 --> 20:58.842
Water here, get your
super cool water here. (whoops)

21:31.958 --> 21:33.918
