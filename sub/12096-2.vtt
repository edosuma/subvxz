00:04.640 --> 00:07.474
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This is the story of two sisters:</i>

00:07.680 --> 00:11.435
<i>Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:11.640 --> 00:16.078
<i>Jessica lives in a neighbourhood</i>
<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.280 --> 00:17.919
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:18.120 --> 00:20.999
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.200 --> 00:23.556
<i>is that she would set it</i>
<i>all to music.</i>

00:24.960 --> 00:28.556
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>
<i>than they do money.</i>

00:31.280 --> 00:34.318
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>Mary Campbell's house.</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:37.919
<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:38.120 --> 00:42.000
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't seem</i>
<i>to be too crazy about her.</i>

00:42.200 --> 00:44.431
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>the Campbells don't have</i>

00:44.640 --> 00:46.757
<i>nearly as much money</i>
<i>as the Tates.</i>

00:47.640 --> 00:51.190
<i>They do, however,</i>
<i>have as many secrets.</i>

00:55.120 --> 00:57.954
<i>Remember the Tates?</i>
<i>Jessica and her husband, Chester?</i>

00:58.160 --> 01:00.755
<i>Chester's a guy who fools around</i>
<i>with everyone but his wife,</i>

01:00.960 --> 01:03.475
<i>and poor Jessica,</i>
<i>because Chester's been so busy,</i>

01:03.680 --> 01:05.433
<i>has taken up with Peter,</i>
<i>the tennis pro,</i>

01:05.640 --> 01:08.519
<i>who in turn has been busy</i>
<i>with Jessica's daughter, Corinne.</i>

01:08.720 --> 01:11.315
<i>Of course Jessica doesn't know</i>
<i>Peter's been busy with Corinne</i>

01:11.520 --> 01:13.000
<i>and Chester's been busy</i>
<i>with everyone.</i>

01:13.160 --> 01:15.470
<i>Jessica just wishes</i>
<i>she'd gone shopping instead.</i>

01:15.680 --> 01:16.909
<i>Remember the Campbells?</i>

01:17.120 --> 01:19.476
<i>Jessica's sister, Mary,</i>
<i>and her second husband, Burt?</i>

01:19.680 --> 01:22.320
<i>The Campbells have problems.</i>
<i>Mary has two problems:</i>

01:22.520 --> 01:24.273
<i>Her son, Danny, is in the Mob.</i>

01:24.480 --> 01:26.199
<i>Her other son, Jodie, is gay.</i>

01:26.400 --> 01:29.199
<i>Danny and Burt have a problem:</i>
<i>They don't get along.</i>

01:29.400 --> 01:32.313
<i>Jodie and Burt have a problem:</i>
<i>They don't get along either.</i>

01:32.520 --> 01:36.958
<i>Mary and Burt have a problem:</i>
<i>Burt can't make love to Mary</i>
<i>and she doesn't know why.</i>

01:37.160 --> 01:39.914
<i>Burt has the biggest problem of all:</i>
<i>He knows why.</i>

01:40.120 --> 01:42.032
<i>He murdered her first husband.</i>

01:45.720 --> 01:48.076
<i>We begin</i>
<i>this week's episode of</i> Soap

01:48.280 --> 01:51.512
<i>shortly after</i>
<i>Jessica's "tennis lesson."</i>

01:51.720 --> 01:52.870
Mary.

01:53.080 --> 01:57.393
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.
I was, uh, taking a tennis lesson.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.600
You know something?
Hm?

01:58.840 --> 02:01.799
You're looking absolutely
wonderful these days.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.440
Really? Oh, thank you.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.116
Younger. You look younger.
Oh, no.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.835
Yes, really.
What are you doing?

02:09.039 --> 02:10.713
Nothing.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.912
Jessie, you're blushing.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.316
Well, I mean,
you're making such a fuss.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.272
Jessie, you didn't.
No, I didn't.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.960
You devil, you.
Mary.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.391
You can tell your own sister.
When did you do it?

02:23.600 --> 02:24.670
Mary! Shh!

02:24.880 --> 02:27.236
I can't believe you did that
without telling me.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.760
Mary.
Did it hurt?

02:28.960 --> 02:30.997
Oh, Mary, come on.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.797
I've always wanted to,
but I'm afraid Burt would kill me.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.753
He's very old-fashioned,
you know.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.633
If he knew I wanted a face-lift...

02:38.840 --> 02:40.752
Mary, please don't
tell anyone, please.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.794
I swear.
Face-lift?

02:44.040 --> 02:45.952
Who did it?
What?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.799
The face-lift.
What face-lift?

02:48.080 --> 02:50.959
Jessica, did you
or did you not have a face-lift?

02:51.160 --> 02:54.039
Not... I not... No, I didn't.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.875
Then what did you
have me swear to?

02:57.880 --> 02:59.633
I didn't have a face-lift.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.796
Jessie.

03:02.400 --> 03:06.155
So, Mary, how are the kids?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.589
Jessie.
Mary.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.793
Oh, Jessie, no. Oh, Jessie.
Oh, Mary.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.710
Oh, Mary, if you ever
tell a soul, I'll kill you.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.752
Who is he?
I can't tell you that.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.191
I'm your sister.
I can't tell you.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.077
I knew it was something.
You're glowing. I can't believe it.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.749
My sister is having an a...

03:30.840 --> 03:34.072
Mary, what am I gonna do?

03:34.280 --> 03:35.953
I mean, I can't go
around glowing.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.391
Chester will know.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.155
I can't go home.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.155
Jessie, Chester won't notice.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.591
He hasn't looked at you
since you were 30.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.792
Now, tell me.
What does he look like?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.595
Oh, you know what
Chester looks like.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.357
No. Him.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.874
Oh, him.
Tall, dark, very athletic.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.673
How old?

04:02.880 --> 04:05.395
Um, I think I need a drink.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.069
He's younger. How old is he?
Younger.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.749
How young could he be?
Young.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.480
Forty.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.875
Thirty-five.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.673
Thirty?

04:16.200 --> 04:19.113
Oh, my God, he's 25.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.313
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Of course he's not 25.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.113
Well, then.
He's 28.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.360
Twenty-eight?
That's wonderful.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.793
Twenty-eight.
No wonder you glow.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.951
Uh, Mary...

04:37.280 --> 04:40.159
Never mind.
Jessie, you can tell me.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.919
No, you'd be shocked.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.831
Jessie, I have a son who's gay.
What could possibly shock me?

04:47.040 --> 04:48.759
Jodie's not gay.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.080
Tell me, Jessie.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.796
You see, I never
realised that I was

05:00.080 --> 05:02.549
a physical person.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.992
You see?
You're shocked.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.919
I don't know exactly
what you mean.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.760
You know, physical.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.118
I don't know.
I like it, Mary.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.832
That's the shocking thing?

05:17.960 --> 05:20.350
Oh, Jessie, you're an original.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.354
Mary, I have to ask
you a question.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.314
I'm so glad you're
open-minded about this.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.791
When you and Burt,
you know, when you...

05:30.000 --> 05:31.434
We don't.
You don't?

05:31.640 --> 05:33.074
No.
Since when?

05:33.280 --> 05:36.239
Long enough for me to forget how.
Oh, dear.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.797
Well, when you did,
did you ever feel like...?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.719
Well, I mean,
just for a few seconds.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.719
Did you ever have
a strange feel...?

05:44.920 --> 05:46.798
I don't know how to describe it.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.871
A feeling like you had melted butter
in your veins instead of blood?

05:54.280 --> 05:57.557
Mary?
Shh. I'm remembering.

05:59.920 --> 06:04.278
Oh, thank God. I thought there
was something wrong with me.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.077
Mary, what have I done?
I mean, in all these years,

06:08.280 --> 06:10.749
Chester has never so much
as looked at another woman,

06:10.960 --> 06:15.477
and now I have done this.
I don't deserve to live.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.479
Jessie, you've got to stop
doing this to yourself.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.838
Has it ever occurred to you
that Chester

06:22.040 --> 06:24.157
might have been unfaithful?

06:24.360 --> 06:27.910
Oh, Mary, please. Chester
hardly ever does it with me.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.840
But with a stranger? Never.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.391
[♫]

06:34.960 --> 06:40.080
Yes, my love, I know.
It just gets better and better.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.036
As soon as I can, pigeon.
I love you.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.318
Bye.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.118
Here's your coffee.
Ah.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.154
Aah! Oh! Oh!

06:57.360 --> 06:58.919
What's the matter?
Not enough cream?

06:59.120 --> 07:00.554
What is the matter with you?

07:00.760 --> 07:02.956
"It just gets
better and better."

07:03.160 --> 07:04.674
Oh, that was really smart,
Chester.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.349
It was really smart to make
a call like that from your office

07:07.560 --> 07:10.678
when I can sit outside and listen to it.
I mean, you are really smart.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.997
Is that it? Is that what
you're carrying on about?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.236
Don't bother, Chester.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.880
Don't bother telling me
you were talking about
the stock market

07:16.960 --> 07:18.640
when you said,
"It gets better and better."

07:18.720 --> 07:21.679
As a matter of fact, that's exactly
what I was talking about.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.793
To "Pigeon"?
Pigeon, Chester?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.560
Who, Walter Pidgeon?

07:29.360 --> 07:33.036
Okay, Claire, you caught me.
I did it.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.920
I, uh, spent the night
with another woman.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.321
Do you know how long
I've been your secretary, Chester?

07:38.480 --> 07:40.119
Since I was 18.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.313
And since I was 19 you've been
telling me you'll leave your wife.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.910
Well, now I'm 30, Chester.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.550
Three weeks ago
I was 30 years old.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.440
It's all right. I sent myself flowers
and signed your name.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.432
Thirty years old and I'm still waiting
for you to leave your wife.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.758
Once. I cheated once.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.111
You cheated once?
That's right.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.960
With this Pigeon person?
Right.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.358
Tell me, do you call her
Pigeon because she coos,

08:08.560 --> 08:11.029
or because she's a carrier of filth?

08:12.040 --> 08:14.157
Oh, Claire.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.240
You know, Chester,
I've known about
Pigeon for weeks.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.591
And before that I knew about
the blond in securities,

08:22.800 --> 08:27.238
the red-headed switchboard operator,
the brunette in payroll.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.761
I've watched you work your way up
through half this building, Chester.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.873
I never knew if you were doing it
by floor or hair colour.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.471
That's enough, Claire.
I've had it. I have had it.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.159
Do you know what
you've turned into?

08:42.360 --> 08:45.398
You have turned into a wife.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.000
You're fired, Claire.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
I'm fired?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.790
That's right, you're fired.
Oh, no, I'm not fired, Chester.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.680
Yes, you are. I'm the boss
and I fired you.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.197
Wrong, Chester!
I am now the boss.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.440
[CHUCKLES]

08:57.640 --> 09:00.030
You see, you fire me
and I tell Jessica everything.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.835
Fine, tell Jessica.
She'll never believe you.

09:03.040 --> 09:06.511
And then maybe I'll call the SEC
and tell them what you did
with the Whitney trust fund.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.392
They'll believe you.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.512
So, Chester,
now let's talk about us.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.313
And where we'll take
our vacation

09:15.520 --> 09:17.637
and how much of a raise
I'm going to get.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.072
Oh, I do need a raise, Chester.
My apartment is much too small.

09:21.720 --> 09:25.680
On the other hand,
maybe I shouldn't
rent a bigger one.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.076
Maybe we should buy me
a condominium.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.077
Well, the tax advantages
would be substantial,

09:31.320 --> 09:36.395
and with my expensive tastes,
you're gonna need all the help
you can get.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.353
Jodie.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.398
Jodie, how many times do I have to
tell you to leave my things alone?

09:45.600 --> 09:46.716
Mother.
Look at that!

09:46.920 --> 09:47.920
My wig, my necklace,

09:48.080 --> 09:49.992
my best dress.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.432
Oh, you wear that belted.
Oh, yeah.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.313
I never thought
of wearing it belted.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.477
It looks much better that way.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.399
Sure, it breaks up
the straight line here,

09:59.600 --> 10:01.512
then you just blouse it slightly
at the waist.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.360
That's much more slimming.
Definitely.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.994
Jodie, get out of my clothes.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.590
Mother, sit down.
Jodie, come on.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.996
Mother, how would you
like a daughter?

10:11.720 --> 10:13.871
What are you talking about?
Sit down, Mom.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.799
Jodie, just tell me.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.915
I'm thinking of having
a sex-change operation.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.478
[LAUGHING]

10:23.080 --> 10:26.915
A sex-change operation.
A sex-change operation.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.237
Right.
I better sit down.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.714
By a sex-change operation,
do you mean

10:37.960 --> 10:39.997
a sex-change operation?

10:40.200 --> 10:42.041
Mm-hm. I spoke to Dr. Fletcher
today, and he...

10:42.120 --> 10:44.589
I'm not thinking about what
I'm gonna tell people, Jodie.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.440
I couldn't care less.
The thing is,

10:47.720 --> 10:49.791
I just got used to you
being a ho...

10:50.000 --> 10:51.798
Homosexual.

10:52.080 --> 10:55.471
I mean, I always
thought you'd outgrow it,
that it was just a phase.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.673
And now, when I'm finally
used to you being a...

10:58.880 --> 11:00.712
Homosexual.

11:00.920 --> 11:05.233
You're going to get
a sex-change operation
and be a girl?

11:05.520 --> 11:08.797
Jodie, for God's sakes,
