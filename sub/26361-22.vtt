10:36.461 --> 10:38.072
[bell rings]

10:38.115 --> 10:39.769
- So people actually pay
for this.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.423
- Hey, it's cheaper
than a shrink

10:41.466 --> 10:42.946
and a hell of a lot better.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.166
- So, what? You--you go into
a room, you--you scream,

10:45.209 --> 10:47.037
and you smash a bunch
of stuff?

10:47.081 --> 10:48.822
- You make it sound so trivial.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.301
- Snake comes here?

10:50.345 --> 10:53.130
- Under a pseudonym, sure.
He rents our deluxe room.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.915
- What do you get with
the deluxe room?

10:54.958 --> 10:56.743
- A dummy, male or female.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.483
Some people rent Donald,
others Hillary.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.181
- How much for both?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.400
- You wouldn't happen to record
these sessions, would ya?

11:02.444 --> 11:05.055
- Gentlemen, we live in
an age of litigation.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.666
[chuckles]

11:06.709 --> 11:08.363
I wouldn't be caught
without it.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.017
- Can we see Snake?

11:11.279 --> 11:12.802
[keys clacking]

11:12.846 --> 11:14.674
- Bitch!

11:14.717 --> 11:16.980
You don't own me!

11:17.024 --> 11:21.637
Dallas, you bitch!

11:21.681 --> 11:23.508
I'm in charge!

11:23.552 --> 11:25.206
[yelling indistinctly]

11:25.249 --> 11:26.947
- You still think
he's innocent?

11:26.990 --> 11:30.907
- Dallas, I'll kill you!

11:42.484 --> 11:44.834
- You find the son of bitches
who hurt my baby?

11:44.878 --> 11:46.706
- Stand up.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.622
- You talked to Amir, right?

11:50.666 --> 11:52.581
- Yeah, we also talked
to Enfado's Playground.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.844
- Nah, man! Come on!

11:54.888 --> 11:56.759
It's a mistake, man!
You don't understand!

11:56.803 --> 11:58.152
It's not how it looks!

11:58.195 --> 11:59.675
- Turn around.
- Hey, I'm deadass, man.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.851
- Turn around.

12:01.895 --> 12:04.158
[cuffs click]

12:04.201 --> 12:06.290
Come on.

12:13.645 --> 12:13.820
.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.170
- I'm in charge! Dallas!
[crashing]

12:16.213 --> 12:17.737
It's a rage joint.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.217
It's for release.
It's better than taking pills.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.915
But see you?

12:21.958 --> 12:24.221
You wouldn't know nothing what
it's like to be in my life.

12:24.265 --> 12:25.614
Not for real for real.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.399
- Your life? Yeah,
it's real rough bring rich.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.794
So what's going on?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.231
Y'all having a little
marital problems?

12:34.275 --> 12:36.799
- Last week,
I died in a car accident!

12:36.843 --> 12:39.497
It's all lies, man!
- Until it ain't.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.325
- Man, get up out of my face!
- What you gonna do?

12:41.369 --> 12:42.762
What, you gonna hit me
like you do Dallas?

12:42.805 --> 12:44.285
- You know, you keep
coming at me, man.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.808
You keep pushing me.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.984
- I'm not sure Fin's the right
Detective for this case.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.420
- I--I'll talk to him.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.770
- You think Snake did this?

12:50.813 --> 12:52.206
- I think when a wife
is assaulted,

12:52.249 --> 12:54.034
the first stop is always
the husband.

12:54.077 --> 12:55.209
- Look at you, man.

12:55.252 --> 12:58.342
All the gifts God gave you.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.954
And this is what you do?

13:02.956 --> 13:05.306
You're a disgrace.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.874
- I'm a disgrace?

13:09.571 --> 13:11.312
You might wanna look
in the mirror.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.617
- Get up off me, man!

13:12.661 --> 13:15.882
- Fin, hey!
What the hell?

13:15.925 --> 13:17.666
- Come get your boy.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.842
- It's the only language guys
like this understand.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.845
- Okay, you're taking
a step back on this case.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.281
- Okay, hands off.

13:24.325 --> 13:26.022
- Take a break, Fin.
Take a break now.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.242
- [sighs]

13:30.244 --> 13:32.420
- [sighs]

13:38.252 --> 13:40.515
Damn.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.648
Jo.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.868
Haven't seen you
in a long time.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.609
Ooh!

13:50.481 --> 13:52.875
Maybe we need to talk
in private, okay?

13:52.919 --> 13:54.790
It's all good.

13:58.663 --> 14:03.494
- I took you in for six months
when your mama died.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.496
- I love you
and I'll always be grateful.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.759
- I sat up with you night
after night.

14:07.803 --> 14:11.894
Rubbing your back for hours
until the nightmares went away.

14:11.938 --> 14:15.419
Just like you
was one of my own!

14:15.463 --> 14:17.291
How could you?

14:17.334 --> 14:20.076
How could you arrest my baby

14:20.120 --> 14:22.905
without so much
as a phone call?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.254
- You were next on the list.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.561
- Ain't him as good
as family to you?

14:26.604 --> 14:28.171
Where's your loyalty?

14:28.215 --> 14:32.915
Do you really believe that
my child could do that?

14:32.959 --> 14:35.222
- Come on,
there's no point to this, Jo.

14:35.265 --> 14:38.094
- I'm his mama.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.488
I gotta do something.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.883
- [sighs]

14:43.926 --> 14:46.015
Look, if you really wanna do
something,

14:46.059 --> 14:49.279
tell me what's going on with
Justin and Dallas.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.629
I mean, what's happening
in that household?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.675
- They married, okay?

14:53.718 --> 14:56.330
- Come on. You know what
I'm talking about.

15:00.638 --> 15:04.947
- When Justin first made it...

15:04.991 --> 15:08.646
the riffraff
wouldn't leave him alone.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.867
Lord only knows the trouble
they brought him.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.872
But Dallas?
She changed all that.

15:16.916 --> 15:20.006
She cleaned him up good.
- And now?

15:21.572 --> 15:25.315
- I don't get to see my baby
as much as I would like.

15:25.359 --> 15:26.838
- Was it because of Dallas?

15:26.882 --> 15:30.973
- She's a superstar.
She makes the rules.

15:31.017 --> 15:34.846
- So you think Justin
is threatened by her success?

15:34.890 --> 15:40.374
- He would never, ever raise
his hands to that girl.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.377
- Okay, Jo, I'ma
be totally honest with you.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.727
It does not look good
for Justin right now.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.730
- And you--you've got
to fix it.

15:50.384 --> 15:54.562
Odafin, you owe us.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.917
You owe me.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.922
- Okay, listen,

16:06.966 --> 16:09.403
you go home
and you take care of Lexi.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.971
And I'll call you.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.798
- [sighs]

16:13.842 --> 16:16.627
- And now Snake's mother is
asking Fin to lie for him?

16:16.671 --> 16:18.368
I want him off the case.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.936
- I will take care of it.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.206
- You saw that?

16:30.250 --> 16:32.469
- She called you family, Fin.

16:33.688 --> 16:36.647
- Um, my old man thought
he could get over

16:36.691 --> 16:39.259
by ripping off the
neighborhood truck dealers.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.783
When the OGs figured it out,

16:41.826 --> 16:45.352
they shot at us when we came
out of the local bodega.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.745
Me and my pops went untouched.

16:47.789 --> 16:50.139
My mother died on the street
on the corner

16:50.183 --> 16:52.924
of Adam Clayton Powell
and 116th street.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.147
- I'm so sorry.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.802
- Jo took me in.

17:00.845 --> 17:03.587
She took me in until my
grandmother and grandfather

17:03.631 --> 17:05.154
moved back from Fayetteville.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.678
She's the one who kept me
out of the system.

17:07.722 --> 17:13.032
- But that doesn't mean that
you can cover for Snake, Fin.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.688
[phone buzzing]

17:21.562 --> 17:23.999
Yeah, Rollins?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.132
I'm on my way.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.438
Dallas is awake.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.440
- What about Snake?

17:30.484 --> 17:33.095
- Keep him in the cage.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.097
I'm sorry, Fin.

17:41.451 --> 17:45.325
- He has never laid
a hand on me.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.676
Look, Justin was mad
when he left.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.373
I will not deny that.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.636
But someone else
did this to me.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.464
I can prove it.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.727
- Okay. We're listening.

17:58.338 --> 18:02.603
- So after he left, I
Facetimed with my mom in Boca.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.910
She's in a nursing home.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.304
So you can check the records.

18:08.348 --> 18:12.613
You'll see Justin was already
at the Apollo.

18:14.528 --> 18:20.316
- So Dallas, tell us what
you remember about the assault.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.189
- [sighs]

18:25.365 --> 18:30.152
Okay, when I got off
the phone with my mom,

18:30.196 --> 18:33.547
I went to bed

18:33.590 --> 18:36.158
and I heard something
downstairs.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.118
And I thought it was
Lexi and Wallace.

18:41.729 --> 18:44.340
And the next thing
I know there was...

18:44.384 --> 18:46.734
this man standing in my room.

18:48.257 --> 18:52.261
He was wearing a mask
and gloves.

18:52.305 --> 18:57.048
And that's when I ran to get
the gun from behind the bar.

19:00.095 --> 19:04.708
And he just hit me and hit me
and hit me and hit me.

19:05.927 --> 19:08.495
- Okay, Dallas. I know
how difficult this s.

19:09.409 --> 19:14.109
We are so sorry to ask
but--but were--were you raped?

19:15.241 --> 19:18.157
- [sobbing]

19:18.200 --> 19:21.725
I--I...

19:21.769 --> 19:25.686
I--I know we're famous,
but we're just people.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.603
[sniffling]

19:29.646 --> 19:31.126
You know, it's just
part of the deal

19:31.170 --> 19:32.519
that we make with the world,
I guess.

19:32.562 --> 19:35.217
- No, no.

19:35.261 --> 19:39.003
No one deserves
what happened to you.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.051
- [sniffs] Well, there's
a whole world on Twitter

19:43.094 --> 19:45.619
that would disagree with you.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.230
- What do you mean?

19:48.274 --> 19:51.755
- Justin and RB Banks
are in a diss war.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.715
They badmouth each other
in their raps.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.238
And they don't mean
nothing by it, you know?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.501
It's just--it's good
for publicity.

19:58.545 --> 20:01.374
It's good for sales.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.941
But there's some fans
out there who--

20:03.985 --> 20:07.293
who take
the whole thing seriously.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.208
- I think that's enough
for today.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.123
She should rest now.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.778
- Thank you.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.694
Fin, the nursing home confirms

20:17.738 --> 20:19.653
that Dallas Facetimed
with her mother

20:19.696 --> 20:21.437
around 9:00 for five minutes.

20:21.481 --> 20:24.223
- NYPD said Snake arrived
at the Apollo

20:24.266 --> 20:25.702
at 8:45 for sound check.

20:25.746 --> 20:29.576
- And the bodyguard discovered
Dallas around 9:30.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.621
Cut him loose.

20:31.665 --> 20:34.102
- [sighs]

20:36.931 --> 20:40.326
Snake, you didn't do it.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.199
- Yeah, I appreciate you.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.723
- [sighs]

20:49.160 --> 20:51.424
I can give you a ride to
the hospital if you need it.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.209
- Nah. I can get there
on my own.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.169
- There's a lot of press
outside.

20:58.213 --> 20:59.867
- Safer than you.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.306
- Liv, look at this.

21:04.350 --> 21:08.049
This was posted on Dallas's
Instagram page two weeks ago.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.139
- Looks like a happy kid.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.836
- Yeah, but look at Snake.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.055
See that's a smart lock?

21:14.098 --> 21:16.753
And if you put it
in slow mode...

21:16.797 --> 21:19.016
see him pressing the buttons?

21:20.366 --> 21:21.932
Right, you can see the code.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.543
I mean, this could be how
the perpetrator got in.

21:23.586 --> 21:26.850
The only problem is this video
got over 200,000 likes.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.330
- So we could be looking at
a stalker.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.158
- Her manager is getting
a list together

21:30.201 --> 21:32.769
of any people that she's
had trouble with in the past.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.293
- Hey, listen to this.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.556
"Come at me again,
I'm gonna side step you.

21:36.599 --> 21:40.299
Teach that black Taylor Swift
wife of yours a lesson."

21:40.342 --> 21:42.649
It's a rap by RB Banks.
It dropped last week.

21:42.692 --> 21:44.041
- Well, that sounds like

21:44.085 --> 21:45.216
it's about a lot more
than publicity.

21:45.260 --> 21:48.089
- Yeah.
- Liv, look at this.

21:48.132 --> 21:51.048
RB Banks liked this Instagram
post of Lexi dancing.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.702
- That gives him means.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.096
- Talk to him.

21:57.620 --> 22:00.014
- I know why you here.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.712
Yeah, bitch got
what she deserved.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.061
- You realize we're cops,
right?

22:04.105 --> 22:05.628
- Yeah, but I ain't
done nothing.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.369
- Yeah, except for teaching
that black Taylor Swift

22:07.413 --> 22:08.588
wife of his a lesson.

22:08.631 --> 22:10.546
- [scoffs]
Have you heard her sing?

22:10.590 --> 22:12.983

a lookie-loo.

of it, huh, Andreas?

32:48.923 --> 32:51.273
That's your bike, right?

32:53.667 --> 32:55.147

32:57.758 --> 32:59.499

33:00.674 --> 33:03.503
- They look similar.
I can't be sure.

33:04.895 --> 33:07.811
- Okay, well,
the problem is--is, uh,

33:07.855 --> 33:11.815
we called all
the food delivery services.

33:11.859 --> 33:15.384
And none of them have
a record of you.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.822

I'm a huge fan.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.348
You know?

if I hung outside

33:25.177 --> 33:27.005
Snake would come out
and talk to me.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.571
- Talk to you about what?

33:28.615 --> 33:30.878
- I don't know. Just talk.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.228
- Well, I can understand that.

33:33.272 --> 33:36.884
I mean, hell,
I had a, uh, cousin

33:36.927 --> 33:39.582
who once traveled halfway
across the world

33:39.626 --> 33:42.411

that way with Snake.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.380

33:54.423 --> 33:58.906
- Yeah. So how come--
how come you stalked his wife?

33:59.950 --> 34:02.127
I mean, you were
at the townhouse

34:02.170 --> 34:04.694
and Snake was at the Apollo
onstage.

34:04.738 --> 34:05.956
- No, I didn't know he was--

34:06.000 --> 34:07.349

months ago.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.704
You were there for Dallas.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.837
- I wasn't there for Dallas.
I was there for Snake.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.795

time with stalkers.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.907

35:26.950 --> 35:29.388
- Because right now
my colleagues have a young kid

35:29.431 --> 35:31.694
named Andreas locked
in a dark room.

35:31.738 --> 35:34.436
They're about to charge
him with assault on Dallas.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.003
I know he's your kid, Vickie.

35:36.046 --> 35:37.265

35:37.309 --> 35:39.049
And he's got no reason
to hurt Dallas.

these games with me?

Let's just start with revenge.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.446

- To get back at the man
who killed his father,

35:46.231 --> 35:49.147
Malik Harper.

35:50.539 --> 35:53.194

who killed Malik.

35:55.065 --> 35:56.937
He--he wasn't even born yet.

you're talking about.

his mother Jo you did.

dead in front of a bodega.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.902
