00:08.342 --> 00:11.210
<i> and the district attorneys</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:11.212 --> 00:13.212
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:13.214 --> 00:16.415
(<i> school bell ringing</i> )

00:20.254 --> 00:22.354
Okay, wake up, sleepyheads.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.490
<i> Vamos, ninos.</i>

00:27.061 --> 00:29.628
(<i> speaking Spanish</i> )

00:29.630 --> 00:32.297
Here you go.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.399
Oh, boy.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.601
Deirdre, wake up, sweetie.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.404
Didi?

00:38.406 --> 00:40.272
CHILD:
Thank you.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.507
Come on, Didi.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.109
Nap time's over.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.812
Deirdre, is something wrong?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.514
I'm sorry, Miss Perez.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.515
Oh, my God.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.650
I'm sorry.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.392
I told them
this would happen.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.393
I told them.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.528
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.129
How is she?

01:04.131 --> 01:05.531
Vitals are there, but
they're flattening out.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.599
Excuse me.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.602
Let's go. Easy.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.539
I knew this was going to happen.

01:13.541 --> 01:17.543
You, uh, her teacher?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.111
Well, what did happen,
Miss...?

01:19.113 --> 01:20.846
Perez.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.548
An accident,
that's what happened.

01:22.550 --> 01:23.849
An accident?

01:23.851 --> 01:25.651
Then why did you
call the police?

01:25.653 --> 01:28.637
What's going on?

01:28.638 --> 01:31.622
Miss Perez, uh, kindly take
control of your classroom.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.691
Are you the principal?

01:32.693 --> 01:35.160
Dr. Babcock.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.529
May I see some
identification?

01:37.531 --> 01:40.632
Was the girl injured
in the school, Dr. Babcock?

01:40.634 --> 01:41.633
Absolutely not.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.102
She was assaulted by her...

01:43.104 --> 01:44.103
Miss Perez.

01:44.105 --> 01:48.140
She can be rather
trigger-happy.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.374
GREEVY:
Have the parents
been notified?

01:49.376 --> 01:50.476
BABCOCK:
I called them,

01:50.478 --> 01:51.577
but there was
no one home.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.279
They both work, I believe.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.281
I'll need
the names and address.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.716
Of course.
In my office.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.261
What the hell's
going on here?

02:09.263 --> 02:11.597
I told Babcock
about Didi.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.233
And he shined you on?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.571
She's dying, isn't she?

03:23.704 --> 03:27.206
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

03:50.831 --> 03:53.398
Ah, an upscale crypt.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.900
But they both work.

03:54.902 --> 03:59.605
Ah, I hope
the elevator works.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.812
Ripperton, Cassal,
Myamoto, Schwartz...

04:06.814 --> 04:09.414
Just your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.782
Yeah, at three grand
a month.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.883
Lowenstein-- 1-B.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.819
Thank God, it's on
the ground floor.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.958
Mrs. Lowenstein?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.630
We need to speak
to Carla Lowenstein.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.697
It's an emergency.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.036
What kind?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.871
What kind? Medical.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.906
Dr. Babcock
tried to phone you.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.709
Yeah, well, I need my rest.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.778
Are you...
Are you Didi's mother?

04:39.780 --> 04:42.648
Yeah. What's the matter?

04:42.650 --> 04:45.751
We want to know if there
was anything wrong

04:45.753 --> 04:46.852
with Deirdre this morning?

04:46.854 --> 04:50.022
This morning?

04:50.024 --> 04:53.759
Yes. Before school.

04:53.761 --> 04:57.696
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you mean.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.899
Perhaps we could
come in and talk.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.801
No, I really would rather
you didn't.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.537
LOGAN:
All right, hold it.
Time out.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.806
Lady, listen to us.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.876
Your daughter
may be losing consciousness.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.514
What are you,
brain-dead yourself?

05:15.516 --> 05:18.016
Well, I fell.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.484
We're not talking about you.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.719
We're talking about
your daughter.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.820
Deirdre. Didi.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.694
Maybe I was holding it
when I fell.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.145
I don't remember.

05:30.146 --> 05:31.595
GREEVY:
Where's your husband,
Mrs. Lowenstein?

05:31.598 --> 05:32.898
Out of town.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.733
Why don't you come with us?
I'm sure Deirdre

05:34.735 --> 05:36.735
would want her mother
to be with her right now.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.103
I can't.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.540
Ezra's not well.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.841
I have to watch it.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.643
Mrs. Lowenstein...

05:53.987 --> 05:55.987
At this stage, it looks like

05:55.989 --> 05:57.923
an acute insult
to the brain stem.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.691
The cat scan will
tell us more.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.992
Doctor, when
you say acute...

06:00.994 --> 06:02.661
I mean traumatic.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.797
Let me ask you. Could it have
been caused by a fall?

06:05.799 --> 06:10.068
Yeah, a fall from
a third-story window, maybe.

06:14.608 --> 06:18.009
WOMAN (<i> over PA</i> ):
We need a volunteer with
a wheelchair to admitting.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.679
Volunteer with wheelchair
to admitting.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.816
MAN:
<i> Hey, I'm just their neighbor.</i>

06:24.818 --> 06:26.818
You never noticed?

06:26.820 --> 06:28.587
How about
an occasional glance

06:28.589 --> 06:31.556
from your box seat
at the rear window?

06:31.558 --> 06:32.758
Give me a break.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.160
Do I look like a peeper to you?
Huh?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.130
Mm-hmm.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.032
Okay, Dick Tracy,

06:41.034 --> 06:43.034
how do I see through
the drawn shades, huh?

06:44.905 --> 06:47.806
You look enough to know
that they're drawn.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.808
You must
see something.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.877
Now, let me reiterate,
gentlemen.

06:51.879 --> 06:55.580
Miss Perez is prone
to excitability.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.948
It's a cultural thing.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.750
Instead of running off
half cocked,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.652
to call the police,
she should have

07:00.654 --> 07:02.888
followed school
district guidelines.
Which are?

07:02.890 --> 07:05.824
Which are to report her
suspicions to the school nurse.

07:05.826 --> 07:09.127
If the nurse finds evidence
of abuse she comes to me.

07:09.129 --> 07:12.030
If I find
the situation warrants it

07:12.032 --> 07:14.833
I'll notify the Department
of Juvenile Services.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.069
By which time,
the kid's in a coma.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.871
Those are some guidelines.

07:19.873 --> 07:24.676
Why don't you stick
to police work, Detective?

07:24.678 --> 07:27.779
Why don't you stop trying

07:27.781 --> 07:29.681
to cover your ass,
Mr. Babcock?

07:29.683 --> 07:30.916
Mike, Mike.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.117
Take it easy.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.586
He's never recovered
from the nuns.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.021
A cultural thing.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.625
Now doc,
let me tell you

07:40.627 --> 07:42.060
about<i> our</i> guidelines, okay?

07:42.062 --> 07:43.829
When someone, anyone--

07:43.831 --> 07:47.933
even a high-strung
Puerto Rican lady--<i> comprende?--</i>

07:47.935 --> 07:49.901
thinks a child
is being beaten

07:49.903 --> 07:53.071
that person
is supposed to report it

07:53.073 --> 07:54.906
to the authorities.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.908
If the authorities don't act

07:56.910 --> 08:00.879
they leave themselves open
to all sorts of repercussions.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.115
Am I making sense to you?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.917
I, uh...

08:08.655 --> 08:10.822
Did Miss Perez ever tell you

08:10.824 --> 08:13.725
that Didi Lowenstein
might be an abused child?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.727
Yes, she did.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.195
When?

08:17.197 --> 08:19.097
Several times,
beginning in September.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.267
Did you do anything about it?

08:22.269 --> 08:23.635
Of course.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.770
I notified
the Juvenile Services.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.740
Oh? Then why
this hush-hush routine?

08:28.742 --> 08:29.875
Because, these days,

08:29.877 --> 08:32.010
there's always a danger
of a witch hunt.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.679
It could destroy
the reputation of the parents.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.982
We have to be very circumspect
about these accusations.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.885
Sure. I understand.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.887
Luckily, we don't.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.021
Let's go, Mike.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.992
There it is.

08:46.994 --> 08:48.894
Dr. Babcock
initiated the report

08:48.896 --> 08:52.764
and we received it
on September 22.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.200
Not much of a report.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.868
What did you do with it?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.905
We filed it,
as required by law.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.306
You didn't follow it up?

09:01.308 --> 09:03.241
Not yet.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.911
We fully intend to.
It's an active file.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.112
As required by...

09:07.114 --> 09:08.880
I know--
as required by law.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.116
Sounds like, "I was
just following orders."

09:11.118 --> 09:12.851
How many other kids

09:12.853 --> 09:14.719
you got on this active
file, Miss Dobrinski?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.793
This is just the city,
Detective Logan.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.962
Last I heard,
there was something like

09:23.964 --> 09:26.998
100,000 cases a year
in the state of New York.

09:28.902 --> 09:33.738
We kind of have our hands full.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.779
Sorry.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.916
I got to go.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.718
Where the hell have you been?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.086
Hey, hey, hey.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.855
Don't take it out
on me, Max.

09:50.857 --> 09:51.990
Domestic violence unit?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.892
Yeah, they dropped
by last month.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.094
No one around but her
and the two kids

09:56.096 --> 09:58.964
but she had a good
head start on a shiner.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.799
Swinging door?
Mugger.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.200
Said he got her right
in front of her building.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.969
And her husband was
out of town again?

10:03.971 --> 10:05.103
Mm-hmm.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.739
What is this guy,
a beer salesman?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.074
He's a shrink.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.812
A shrink?

10:15.882 --> 10:18.350
Let's go see
if the doctor's in yet.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.762
LOGAN:
Just hold your psycho-babble
to a minimum, lady.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.897
I got a question
I want to ask.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.133
Are you in charge
of this ape?

10:35.135 --> 10:37.035
My cross to bear.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.905
We're trying to get
a business address

10:40.907 --> 10:43.041
for Dr. Lowenstein.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.877
You know,
Jacob Lowenstein.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.945
He's one of your people.

10:46.947 --> 10:47.946
Was.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.014
Used to be.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.500
What happened?

10:51.501 --> 10:53.985
There was...
there were some problems.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.887
Of what nature, Miss Rawlins?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.856
I'm not at liberty
to discuss this.

10:57.858 --> 11:01.426
Fine. For now,
we just have to find him.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.228
His child is sick.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.830
Didi?

11:07.434 --> 11:10.435
He... I understand
that he sometimes

11:10.437 --> 11:16.107
does some consulting work
out of the Graybar building.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.922
Dr. Lowenstein?

11:30.924 --> 11:33.124
End of the hall.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.364
(<i> man crying</i> )

11:43.303 --> 11:46.004
(<i> woman moaning</i> )

11:50.010 --> 11:51.076
Good. Very good.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.144
Dr. Lowenstein?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.414
We're in the middle
of a session here!

11:56.416 --> 12:01.953
Yeah. I can see that.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.054
Who are you?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.322
What do you want here?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.957
It's about Didi.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.193
She's sick.

12:08.195 --> 12:12.130
We thought you'd like to know.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.007
We can't hold
this guy forever.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.943
You're going to have
to charge him with something.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.344
That bottle
of cocaine we found,

12:26.346 --> 12:28.913
he's going spastic trying
to tap dance around that one.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.381
What are you
talking about?

12:30.383 --> 12:32.851
What the hell's going on?
You know the law.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.018
It's an invalid search.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.053
You've got no warrant

12:35.055 --> 12:36.454
you've got
no probable cause.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.922
You got nothing here.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.325
That's it, no.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.927
(<i> shouting</i> )

12:42.929 --> 12:44.062
You have
no right to...

12:44.064 --> 12:45.897
GREEVEY:
Is something the matter, doc?

12:45.899 --> 12:47.198
He's trying
to sandbag me.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.900
He's trying to railroad me

12:48.902 --> 12:50.835
into something that I don't
know anything about.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.071
You trying to tell me
you were totally unaware

12:53.073 --> 12:54.272
of your daughter's
condition?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.940
That's right.
Completely.

12:55.942 --> 12:56.975
And why is that?

12:56.977 --> 13:00.445
Why is that?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.481
I was, uh... a little out of it.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.216
We thought it was out of town.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.018
What? Carla tell
you that?

13:08.388 --> 13:12.357
Look, I have
to tell her something.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.959
She's unbelievably
jealous.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.862
If I'm working late
at the office

13:17.864 --> 13:19.964
she assumes that
I'm getting carpet burn

13:19.966 --> 13:22.934
with the cleaning lady,
my secretary, anybody.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.135
Doesn't matter.

13:24.137 --> 13:28.039
Aren't you?
Aren't I what?

13:30.210 --> 13:33.945
Please. That was therapy.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.980
For her or for you?

13:35.982 --> 13:37.982
For her.

13:37.984 --> 13:42.987
In Reichian therapy,
the patient has to...

13:42.989 --> 13:45.190
Really get
to know

13:45.192 --> 13:47.258
the therapist.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.996
How about those legs
of hers, huh?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.998
Who was it?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.900
Uh, James M. Cain.

13:55.902 --> 13:57.902
"She looked so good

13:57.904 --> 14:00.038
I wanted to hit her
with a hammer."

14:00.040 --> 14:02.073
(<i> laughs</i> )

14:03.310 --> 14:07.545
Hey, it was only
a figure of speech.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.514
Is that what happened to Didi?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.084
What are you talking about?

14:15.155 --> 14:18.223
What? You think I hit Didi?

14:20.060 --> 14:23.261
I'm dealing with
an irrational person.

14:23.263 --> 14:28.399
I'm trying to keep
everything together.

14:28.401 --> 14:30.969
How? By giving her
a slap once in a while?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.036
Keep her
in line?
Max.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.972
Oh, no, my son is with her.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.473
My son, my son
is with her.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.041
We'll take care
of it.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.743
I was there lunchtime

14:38.744 --> 14:40.444
and she never even mentioned
that Didi was hurt.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.947
Hey! Hey!
I have to get out of here.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.183
She could do a number on him.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.185
I'm afraid of what
she's going to do.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.953
Now can we hold the guy?

14:48.955 --> 14:54.058
Maybe you better bring in
Mrs. Lowenstein, too, huh?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.159
(<i> whistling</i> )

14:55.161 --> 14:56.527
Stop doing that with your eyes.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.263
You keep doing that
with your eyes

14:58.265 --> 15:00.498
they'll stay stuck like that
for the rest of your life.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.200
Didn't I warn you?

15:02.202 --> 15:03.534
(<i> knocking at door</i> )

15:03.536 --> 15:05.336
You hear me?
You're going to learn, mister.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.572
You are going to learn
if it's the last thing I do.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.173
Come here. Come here.
Come on.

15:09.175 --> 15:11.342
You're going to listen to me
once and for all.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.278
LOGAN:
<i> Open this door! Open up, now!</i>

15:13.279 --> 15:15.213
I'll teach you a lesson
you're never going to forget.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.381
(<i> door kicked open</i> )

15:16.383 --> 15:18.216
Come on! Come on!
You have to learn!

15:18.218 --> 15:19.484
You have to learn!

15:19.486 --> 15:20.985
Mommy!
What are you doing?

15:20.987 --> 15:24.355
That's not yours!
That's not his!

15:24.357 --> 15:26.291
(<i> hysterically crying</i> )

15:26.293 --> 15:28.326
Good God almighty.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.628
He's got to learn!

15:30.630 --> 15:33.031
I know, I know, I know.

15:33.033 --> 15:37.635
GREEVEY:
She seems
to be improving.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.637
Ballismus.

15:41.308 --> 15:45.243
It's an involuntary reaction.

15:45.245 --> 15:50.114
It's a sign
of deep cerebral damage.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.123
Deirdre didn't just
hit her head, Carla.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.559
Somebody must have done
something to her.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.394
Where did you say Jacob was?

16:03.396 --> 16:05.663
He's in custody, don't
worry, he can't hurt you.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.665
Is he all right?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.401
I mean, nobody can, you know...

16:10.403 --> 16:13.204
you know, get to him, can they?

16:13.206 --> 16:15.606
Why would anyone
want to get to him?

16:18.111 --> 16:20.645
Well, he's
a very attractive man.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.081
Did he ask for me?

16:25.485 --> 16:29.687
I really need to see him.

16:29.689 --> 16:33.191
GREEVEY:
That's up to him.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.293
Now, Carla,

16:35.295 --> 16:36.594
try to remember.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.429
Did you ever see Jacob

16:38.431 --> 16:41.099
strike either of your children?

16:41.101 --> 16:46.437
He's a very loving father.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.538
He's beaten you.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.674
He loves me.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.678
We're very much in love.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.116
Do you know that Ezra

16:58.118 --> 17:00.251
is with juvenile authorities
under protective custody?

17:00.253 --> 17:02.387
How can I be expected
to know anything?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.657
How you doing?

17:06.659 --> 17:09.127
I can use some
more stuff, you know?

17:09.129 --> 17:11.129
In a little while.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.897
I'm afraid I'm going

17:12.898 --> 17:14.664
to have to ask you
to come back another time.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.734
No problem.

17:18.338 --> 17:22.707
(<i> indistinct PA announcement</i> )

17:32.552 --> 17:35.319
You think
she beat the kid up?

17:35.321 --> 17:37.321
I don't know.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.257
I know she's nuts.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.726
The way she lay there...

17:41.728 --> 17:44.595
primping herself, you know.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.498
It just made me want to puke.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.234
She has been slapped
around pretty good.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.770
I'm not so sure she's to blame.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.673
There are some women
who provoke it.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.508
Come on, it's true.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.310
You think she cares

17:59.312 --> 18:01.512
diddly about those kids
or anything else?

18:01.514 --> 18:02.580
Huh?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.583
Everything's a mirror to her.

18:05.585 --> 18:09.754
She holds a dying kid up to it,
and all she can see

18:09.756 --> 18:12.723
is herself,
and how it affects her.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.460
Now you give her sympathy,
she's going to want to fight.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.728
You give her a fight,
she's gonna want a kiss.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.764
You give her a kiss,
and I swear to God

18:19.766 --> 18:21.399
she'll bite your tongue out.

18:21.401 --> 18:24.802
You, uh...

18:24.804 --> 18:28.339
you saw this on Oprah or what?

18:28.341 --> 18:30.808
My mother.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.679
Yeah.

18:34.681 --> 18:38.549
She always said she was cut out
for something greater

18:38.551 --> 18:42.787
than being the wife of a cop
from the Lower East Side.

18:42.789 --> 18:46.691
God, she was...
she was a bottomless pit.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.426
I mean it was always

18:48.428 --> 18:49.694
"Give me your
undivided attention"

18:49.696 --> 18:53.531
but when the old man
couldn't take anymore

18:53.533 --> 18:55.566
and gave her a whack,

18:55.568 --> 18:58.536
then she'd turn around
and whack me.

19:00.306 --> 19:04.308
She always got this look
in her eye, you know

19:04.310 --> 19:06.577
and then
I saw it coming.

19:06.579 --> 19:11.682
Now this witch in here...

19:11.684 --> 19:16.254
she's got that same look.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.725
We have blood on the floor, yes,

19:20.727 --> 19:22.660
it matches the blood
on Deirdre's head, yes,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.595
and yes, we haven't proven
anything here.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.464
How about we try to obtain
a confession?

19:26.466 --> 19:27.732
We got an M.E. who says

19:27.734 --> 19:29.567
there's no way
it was an accident.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.470
You want me to go and
beat it out of her, Mike?

19:32.472 --> 19:33.538
I'm sure he means

19:33.540 --> 19:34.839
why don't we go
work Lowenstein?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.474
And that's
a good idea.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.742
I released him.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.610
What?
What?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.746
He was screaming false
imprisonment on the coke bust.

19:41.748 --> 19:42.713
No probable cause!

19:42.715 --> 19:43.748
Thanks
for telling us.

19:43.750 --> 19:44.815
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

19:44.817 --> 19:46.817
Cragen... Yes, Max.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.352
What?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.621
It's for you.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.657
Yeah?

19:52.659 --> 19:54.825
Yes, Rudy.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.630
What, did you get
a new pair of binoculars?

19:59.632 --> 20:01.732
Look, sometimes...

20:01.734 --> 20:04.502
well, occasionally,
the shades are up.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.772
Every once in a while,
I just happen to look out.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.508
And do you ever happen
to see anything?

20:10.510 --> 20:13.411
Two nights ago,
mommie dearest

20:13.413 --> 20:15.479
was dancing around
like a whirling dervish.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.781
Where was the little girl?

20:16.783 --> 20:20.651
She was shaking her
like she was a rag doll,

20:20.653 --> 20:23.487
and then the husband came home.

20:23.489 --> 20:24.855
What time was that?

20:24.857 --> 20:27.558
I don't know, late.
11:00, maybe later.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.294
Look, I wanted to tell you,
but I was afraid...

20:30.296 --> 20:33.531
What happened when
Dr. Lowenstein came in?

20:33.533 --> 20:34.799
He belted her.

20:34.801 --> 20:35.800
The girl?

20:35.802 --> 20:36.934
No, the wife.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.536
And then she slapped the kid.

20:38.538 --> 20:41.339
I told you.
Didn't I tell you?

20:41.341 --> 20:43.608
I can't believe
she's not locked up.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.643
She's under
observation at Bellevue.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.996
The hell she is.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.348
I just saw her getting out
of a cab less than an hour ago.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.917
Ain't bureaucracy great?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.619
And she had
the little boy with her.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.812
Where's the boy?

21:22.915 --> 21:27.685
(<i> whimpering</i> )

21:27.687 --> 21:30.554
Now Carla,
I'm taking you in.

21:30.556 --> 21:32.556
Come on up now.

21:32.558 --> 21:33.924
Do you understand?

21:33.926 --> 21:35.726
Let's go.

21:35.728 --> 21:38.596
I'm charging you
with assault on Didi.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.830
(<i> person approaching</i> )
Max.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.802
Did he do this to you?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.871
Carla...

21:48.841 --> 21:51.776
You stupid cow.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.377
No!

21:53.379 --> 21:54.845
You're under arrest.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.514
Cuffs!

21:59.385 --> 22:01.452
Daddy, Pookie's scared.

22:01.454 --> 22:04.488
Pookie doesn't want
to go to jail.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.724
You see? You see what
I got to put up with?

22:06.726 --> 22:08.759
Come on.
We're going for a walk.

22:08.761 --> 22:11.395
You have the right
to remain silent.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.497
You have the right
to an attorney.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.667
Anything you do say may be used
against you in a court of law.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.373
$500,000 is unreal, Your Honor.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.008
JUDGE:
I can make
it higher.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.110
Dr. Lowenstein
has made his bail

22:26.112 --> 22:28.446
because he controls
all the family funds.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.047
This woman is indigent.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.982
In this instance,
half a million dollars bail

22:31.984 --> 22:34.385
is not only excessive
it is discriminatory.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.087
Oh, why is that?

22:36.089 --> 22:37.855
GREEN:
Look at this woman.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.124
She can hardly follow
the proceedings

22:40.126 --> 22:41.459
she's been so badly beaten.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.361
My heart bleeds.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.363
What's your point?

22:45.365 --> 22:50.668
She needs medical attention,
not jail time.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.070
There's an infirmary at the
women's prison, Your Honor.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.573
JUDGE:
Mrs. Lowenstein's bond
remains as set.

22:55.575 --> 23:00.411
Officer, handle her
with kid gloves.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.879
Please.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.115
It's all right,
it's all right.

23:09.956 --> 23:14.158
(<i> steady tone</i> )

23:14.160 --> 23:19.096
Soon as you can, um,
I need the details.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.574
It's just that
I find it hard to believe.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.576
ROBINETTE:
Trust me,
I don't go around

23:32.578 --> 23:34.912
delivering news
like this as a gag.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.415
What about my baby,
is he all right?

23:37.417 --> 23:38.182
He's okay.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.050
He's in a foster home

23:40.052 --> 23:41.619
until this thing
gets resolved.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.887
Oh, Ezra.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.989
ROBINETTE:
Yes, of course.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.024
What baby were you referring to?

23:50.930 --> 23:52.196
Your husband?

23:52.198 --> 23:54.632
Is that who you're
thinking about

23:54.634 --> 23:56.133
at a time like this?

23:56.135 --> 24:01.439
So it's resolved.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.542
What do you mean?

24:04.544 --> 24:05.943
Didi's gone.

24:05.945 --> 24:06.944
It's over.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.145
Resolved.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.514
I'd like to get some rest.

24:10.516 --> 24:12.216
GREEN:
Carla,

24:12.218 --> 24:14.118
this is very serious.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.921
I know that.

24:16.923 --> 24:19.523
I'm accused of murdering
my own daughter,

24:19.525 --> 24:20.524
isn't that it?

24:20.526 --> 24:23.327
Yes, yes, you are.

24:23.328 --> 24:26.129
We have a witness who saw you
roughing Deirdre up that night.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.499
But only you and your husband
know which one of you hit her.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.000
Maybe you didn't hit her.

24:30.002 --> 24:30.701
Maybe your husband...

24:30.703 --> 24:33.103
Nobody hit Didi.

24:33.105 --> 24:36.207
Okay... pushed her down.

24:36.209 --> 24:38.943
Maybe she wouldn't stop crying,
so he picked her up and...

24:38.945 --> 24:41.512
He picked her up.

24:41.514 --> 24:43.047
And then he threw her?

24:43.049 --> 24:48.085
And then he laid hands on it.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.054
What do you mean?

24:50.056 --> 24:51.222
To fix it.

24:51.224 --> 24:54.124
To make it better.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.694
Jacob says

24:56.696 --> 25:00.998
that healing is a matter
of adjusting your mind

25:01.000 --> 25:02.800
to God's will.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.547
What a pleasant surprise.

25:16.549 --> 25:19.550
On Didi Lowenstein,
did you find evidence

25:19.552 --> 25:20.784
of sexual abuse?

25:20.786 --> 25:23.087
No.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.222
Did you look?

25:25.224 --> 25:27.091
No.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.092
Why not?

25:28.094 --> 25:29.627
'Cause nobody told me to.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.128
Somebody just did.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.534
JUDGE:
<i> The point, Miss Green.</i>

25:36.536 --> 25:40.204
Your Honor, Carla Lowenstein
was battered almost to death

25:40.206 --> 25:42.206
by Mr. Redding's client.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.207
To try them together
would be a terrible injustice.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.243
Since we're not in open court

25:46.245 --> 25:48.846
can we dispense
with the feminist rhetoric

25:48.848 --> 25:50.281
and talk bottom line?

25:50.282 --> 25:51.715
Since I do agree
with you on one point.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.285
Dr. Lowenstein
is innocent of murder

25:54.287 --> 25:56.554
since he did not strike Deirdre.

25:56.556 --> 25:59.023
Therefore, I would
like a severance.

25:59.025 --> 26:01.258
Mr. Stone?

26:01.260 --> 26:03.694
There has been a total disregard

26:03.696 --> 26:06.263
for the life
of an innocent child...

26:06.265 --> 26:07.731
of two innocent children.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.700
I'd like to insure

26:09.702 --> 26:11.235
that history
doesn't repeat itself

26:11.237 --> 26:13.337
in the Lowenstein household.

26:13.339 --> 26:17.241
One of those two people
struck a six-year-old child

26:17.243 --> 26:20.344
with enough force to stop
her brain from functioning.

26:20.346 --> 26:23.247
Neither one has
been forthcoming

26:23.249 --> 26:26.283
and both of them
know which one did it.

26:26.285 --> 26:31.622
I think the truth
will only come out

26:31.624 --> 26:34.258
if one turns on the other.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.907
In the case of
<i> People v. Jacob Lowenstein</i>

26:49.909 --> 26:51.342
Indictment Number 6695:

26:51.344 --> 26:54.612
The charges brought
are Murder in the Second Degree

26:54.614 --> 26:56.146
Assault
in the First Degree

26:56.148 --> 26:58.916
Endangering
the Welfare of a minor.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.385
In the case of
<i>People v. Carla Lowenstein</i>

27:01.387 --> 27:03.187
Indictment Number 6695-A,

27:03.189 --> 27:06.090
The charges are
Murder in the Second Degree,

27:06.092 --> 27:07.691
Assault
in the First Degree

27:07.693 --> 27:10.160
Endangering
the Welfare of a Minor.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.229
Is the defense ready?

27:12.231 --> 27:14.264
Ready, Your Honor.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.334
Ready, Your Honor.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.670
JUDGE:
Are the People ready?

27:19.672 --> 27:21.271
Ready, Your Honor.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.341
CARLA:
Honey...

27:25.745 --> 27:27.778
Honey...

27:30.683 --> 27:32.216
JUDGE:
Mrs. Lowenstein!

27:32.218 --> 27:35.185
Honey?

27:35.187 --> 27:36.387
JUDGE:
Counsel is asked

27:36.389 --> 27:38.355
to advise your client

27:38.357 --> 27:40.758
to exhibit
some restraint.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.228
She was always yanking her,
slapping her.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.764
She was always mad at Didi.

27:46.766 --> 27:50.334
Yanking and slapping
and pulling her hair?

27:50.336 --> 27:54.238
This convinced you that Didi
was being abused, Miss Perez?

27:54.240 --> 27:58.275
No, no, that's only what I saw
her mother do to her.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.812
But Didi was always coming in
with much more serious injuries.

28:01.814 --> 28:04.748
Objection.
Miss Perez is not a physician.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.250
I'll rephrase.

28:06.252 --> 28:10.287
Miss Perez, did you ever see
any signs of physical abuse

28:10.289 --> 28:11.989
on Didi Lowenstein?

28:11.991 --> 28:12.990
Yes.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.725
Would you describe them?

28:14.727 --> 28:17.428
Large purple bruises on her legs
and they continued

28:17.430 --> 28:19.430
under her underpants.

28:19.432 --> 28:20.931
A black eye...

28:20.933 --> 28:22.366
scalded hands.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.001
STONE:
Did Didi say

28:24.003 --> 28:26.970
how she received
these injuries?

28:26.972 --> 28:31.241
She said,
"Mommy said I was naughty

28:31.243 --> 28:35.813
for not finishing my dinner."

28:35.815 --> 28:37.881
STONE:
No further questions,
Your Honor.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.019
No questions, Your Honor.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.888
JUDGE:
You may step down,
Miss Perez.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.293
Bitch!

28:57.903 --> 28:59.269
She did it, Adam.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.305
That's not my problem.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.407
One way or another,
that woman hit her daughter.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.908
Then what is your problem?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.310
Perez's testimony
destroyed her.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.412
If Green is asking
for a meeting,

29:08.414 --> 29:10.314
she's willing
to make a deal.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.316
The whole thing
is unfathomable.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.785
I feel like I'm floating
face down

29:14.787 --> 29:16.887
with a mile
of black water

29:16.889 --> 29:19.289
between me and any
reasonable explanation for this.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.892
Why does it
have to be reasonable?

29:21.894 --> 29:25.395
Well, there's something
else going on here.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.331
It's not her, it's him.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.000
There's something depraved.

29:30.002 --> 29:33.003
All right, now, what bothers you
the most about this?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.471
Well, um...

29:39.545 --> 29:41.345
my own rage.

29:41.347 --> 29:45.549
What do your guts
tell you?

29:45.551 --> 29:48.352
Put them both
in a dungeon.

29:48.354 --> 29:52.289
Put them on the wheel
and annihilate them.

29:52.291 --> 29:56.026
Can you get to him
through her?

29:56.028 --> 29:57.027
I think so.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.462
All right, then do it.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.899
If you think that
he is the greater evil

30:01.901 --> 30:04.468
you go for him where
he's most vulnerable

30:04.470 --> 30:06.370
and you make the deal.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.509
It's your meeting.

30:12.511 --> 30:16.380
Miss Perez was a powerful,
if biased, witness.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.348
I think the jury thought so.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.020
Let's plea her down.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.822
On what basis?

30:24.824 --> 30:26.924
The basis of her being willing
to accept limited culpability

30:26.926 --> 30:28.025
with mitigating circumstances...

30:28.027 --> 30:29.359
CARLA:
I did it.

30:30.863 --> 30:34.398
I killed Didi.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.973
I hit her.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.442
Why?

30:49.348 --> 30:52.015
I can't remember.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.918
She was out of her mind
on cocaine

30:54.920 --> 30:56.587
which he gave to her.

30:56.589 --> 30:57.955
He abused her.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.423
He abused the children.

30:59.425 --> 31:03.427
He encouraged her to beat
the little girl.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.163
Mrs. Lowenstein,
why would he want you

31:06.165 --> 31:07.397
to do such a thing?

31:07.399 --> 31:09.900
He wanted me to train her.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.469
I'm sorry?

31:15.140 --> 31:17.374
To train her...

31:19.144 --> 31:20.911
for later

31:20.913 --> 31:23.947
so we could both
serve him.

31:26.986 --> 31:31.054
Will you testify to that
on the stand?

31:39.131 --> 31:42.199
(<i> whispering</i> )

31:45.537 --> 31:49.673
Mrs. Lowenstein,
intoxication is no defense

31:49.675 --> 31:52.009
for depraved indifference
homicide.

31:52.011 --> 31:55.445
However, since we feel
that she was coerced

31:55.447 --> 31:59.049
and that she was
physically threatened

31:59.051 --> 32:01.952
we'll accept a plea on Man One.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.187
And Dr. Lowenstein?

32:04.189 --> 32:06.223
Him?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.425
I'll get him for murder.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.061
(<i> Carla sobs</i> )

32:21.140 --> 32:22.406
Ladies and gentlemen,

32:22.408 --> 32:25.275
I inform you now
that Carla Lowenstein

32:25.277 --> 32:28.011
is no longer party
to this trial.

32:28.013 --> 32:31.214
<i> The People v. Jacob Lowenstein</i>

32:31.216 --> 32:33.350
will therefore proceed
on its own merits.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.018
MEDICAL EXAMINER:
Yes, I recognize them.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.219
These were taken

32:36.221 --> 32:38.588
during the autopsy
of Deirdre Lowenstein

32:38.590 --> 32:40.057
Which you performed?

32:40.059 --> 32:41.876
Yes.

32:41.877 --> 32:43.694
Did you find evidence
of sexual molestation?

32:43.696 --> 32:45.162
Yes, I did.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.397
STONE:
Have you formed an opinion

32:47.399 --> 32:49.967
as to the time
the fatal blow was struck?

32:49.969 --> 32:52.069
Between 10:00
and 11:00 p.m.,

32:52.071 --> 32:55.038
from the rate
at which the blood clotted

32:55.040 --> 32:58.342
and also the amount
of coagulation in the wound

32:58.344 --> 33:00.344
that would be the time.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.645
Thank you, Doctor.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.046
That will be all.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.285
The People call
Carla Lowenstein.

33:20.232 --> 33:23.066
Place your left hand
on the Bible.

33:23.068 --> 33:26.003
Raise your right hand.
Raise your right hand.

33:26.005 --> 33:28.672
Mrs. Lowenstein, do you
swear to tell the truth,

33:28.674 --> 33:31.208
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

33:31.210 --> 33:32.676
I do.

33:41.754 --> 33:44.221
Mrs. Lowenstein,
tell the court

33:44.223 --> 33:48.325
why you struck your daughter
hard enough to kill her.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.763
Well, I was loaded

33:52.765 --> 33:58.769
and I really didn't think
I had any strength left.

34:04.476 --> 34:07.310
Why would you do such a thing?

34:14.420 --> 34:16.820
My husband--
he convinced me to.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.255
She's out of her mind!

34:18.257 --> 34:20.223
Dr. Lowenstein,
one more outburst

34:20.225 --> 34:22.492
and I'll have
you shackled

34:22.494 --> 34:25.395
for the remainder
of this trial.

34:25.397 --> 34:29.266
Did your husband tell you why
he wanted you to strike Didi?

34:29.268 --> 34:34.504
Well, he said that
we all needed discipline

34:34.506 --> 34:37.541
and that he wanted...

34:37.543 --> 34:42.412
Didi to grow up
to be just like her mother.

34:42.414 --> 34:47.250
He wanted her to...

34:47.252 --> 34:50.120
to be the perfect wife
just like me.

34:50.122 --> 34:53.824
STONE:
I beg your pardon?

34:53.826 --> 34:56.827
He said he wanted her
to be the perfect wife

34:56.829 --> 34:58.528
just like me.

34:58.530 --> 35:03.467
He wanted her
to be a perfect wife.

35:05.504 --> 35:09.806
Did your husband
ever abuse Didi sexually?

35:09.808 --> 35:11.842
REDDING:
Objection, Your Honor.

35:11.844 --> 35:14.111
That has nothing to do
with the night in question.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.112
Overruled.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.413
Answer the question.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.785
Well, it... it wasn't abuse.

35:26.558 --> 35:31.161
I mean... he loved her.

35:31.163 --> 35:33.263
He just...

35:35.367 --> 35:38.535
He just had to find a way
to show it.

36:05.797 --> 36:08.565
No further questions,
Your Honor.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.440
Carla?

36:19.578 --> 36:23.647
How often did you get loaded?

36:23.649 --> 36:25.849
Not very often.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.318
Well, say, ballpark.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.920
Once a week?

36:29.922 --> 36:31.621
Three times?

36:31.623 --> 36:32.622
Five?

36:32.624 --> 36:34.257
I don't know.

36:34.259 --> 36:36.526
It... you know,
when I needed it.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.529
When things just got to be
too much.

36:39.531 --> 36:43.533
Aren't you, in fact,
a cocaine addict, Carla?

36:43.535 --> 36:45.569
Objection, Your Honor.
Characterization.

36:45.571 --> 36:49.339
JUDGE:
Sustained.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.575
When you are loaded, Carla,

36:51.577 --> 36:55.345
aren't your children
afraid of you?

36:55.347 --> 36:56.479
STONE:
Objection, Your Honor.

36:56.481 --> 36:58.348
He's leading the witness.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.950
Overruled.

36:59.952 --> 37:04.387
Carla, the neighbors all say

37:04.389 --> 37:07.490
that when you were out together
as a family,

37:07.492 --> 37:12.295
Didi was always walking
hand-in-hand with her father,

37:12.297 --> 37:13.563
never with you

37:13.565 --> 37:16.433
and they thought
that very odd,

37:16.435 --> 37:19.436
that a mother
should be so distant

37:19.438 --> 37:21.338
from her daughter.

37:23.275 --> 37:26.476
Well, I wanted to hold her hand,
but, uh...

37:29.581 --> 37:32.616
she wouldn't let me.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.487
(<i> Carla sighs</i> )

37:37.489 --> 37:41.391
Redding hurt us.

37:42.494 --> 37:45.362
I didn't hear you knock.

37:45.364 --> 37:46.930
That's because I didn't.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.497
If I'd have knocked,
you'd have heard it.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.434
I don't doubt that.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.503
Well...

37:53.504 --> 37:55.571
How come you didn't you ask
the right question, Stone?

37:55.574 --> 37:57.557
Which is?

37:57.558 --> 37:59.541
Which is how does
Dr. Lowenstein

37:59.544 --> 38:02.979
support his
cosmopolitan lifestyle?

38:02.981 --> 38:05.315
Analysts make a comfortable
living, don't they?

38:05.317 --> 38:06.483
Come on, Stone,
he's a witch doctor.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.018
He couldn't give it
away for free.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.552
Rich parents?

38:09.554 --> 38:11.688
He sells cocaine.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.456
He deals.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.558
Upper West Side,
intellectual

38:15.560 --> 38:17.661
artsy-tartsy
but big time.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.562
Why are you
telling me this?

38:19.564 --> 38:21.498
Isn't this
a conflict of interest?

38:21.500 --> 38:23.300
Because ethically,
I'm Snow White.

38:23.302 --> 38:24.701
I'm an officer
of the court.

38:24.703 --> 38:27.604
My client's already
had her day in it.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.640
You and I both know
he made her what she is.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.575
That's too simple.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.478
Simple or complicated,
tipped straight up.

38:35.480 --> 38:39.983
Besides, I felt it was my duty.

38:45.457 --> 38:48.058
Rawlings is listed
as a defense witness.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.426
We call her

38:49.428 --> 38:51.594
have her declared
a hostile witness

38:51.596 --> 38:53.530
and pump her on the coke.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.632
STONE:
Miss Rawlings,
this session--

38:55.634 --> 38:57.600
was this a therapy session?

38:57.602 --> 38:58.702
Of course.

38:58.704 --> 39:00.070
Of what sort?

39:00.072 --> 39:02.605
Well, it was Reichian.

39:02.607 --> 39:03.807
Yes?

39:03.809 --> 39:06.643
Dr. Lowenstein
is a well-known Reichian.

39:06.645 --> 39:07.744
Does that mean
Dr. Lowenstein

39:07.746 --> 39:10.080
supplied you
with cocaine?

39:10.082 --> 39:11.381
I don't believe this.

39:11.383 --> 39:12.482
Quiet.

39:12.484 --> 39:15.385
Answer the question, please.

39:18.090 --> 39:19.556
Yes.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.091
Did you inhale it?

39:21.093 --> 39:23.626
We were smoking it,
all right?

39:23.628 --> 39:27.664
He said it would help me
get in touch with...

39:27.666 --> 39:29.799
With what, Miss Rollins?
With the child within?

39:29.801 --> 39:33.069
Did Dr. Lowenstein
also sell you cocaine?

39:33.071 --> 39:34.354
Objection, Your Honor!

39:34.355 --> 39:35.638
Absolutely irrelevant
to the night in question.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.574
Ah, but it does have relevance.

39:37.576 --> 39:41.111
Dr. Lowenstein's drug use,
his drug dealing, was one of,

39:41.113 --> 39:43.513
if not the major contributing
factor to the nightmare

39:43.515 --> 39:45.415
of the Lowenstein household,

39:45.417 --> 39:46.616
and this depraved indifference

39:46.618 --> 39:49.119
led directly to Didi
Lowenstein's death.

39:49.121 --> 39:51.087
JUDGE:
Overruled.

39:51.089 --> 39:54.424
Answer the question.

39:56.595 --> 39:57.727
Yes.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.562
To your personal knowledge

39:59.564 --> 40:02.031
did Dr. Lowenstein
also sell cocaine

40:02.033 --> 40:03.633
to other patients?

40:03.635 --> 40:05.568
Objection. Leading the witness.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.854
Overruled.

40:07.855 --> 40:10.139
Miss Rawlings,
yes or no, please.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.147
Yes.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.752
REDDING:
And finally, Dr. Lowenstein,

40:22.754 --> 40:25.622
did you ever abuse Deirdre?

40:25.624 --> 40:29.626
Didi was the one ray
of sunshine in my life.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.461
I never abused her.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.062
I used to hold her

40:33.064 --> 40:35.765
and try to protect
her from...

40:35.767 --> 40:39.636
well, Carla,
who I now realize is insane.

40:39.638 --> 40:43.640
And even she says that
I never abused her.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.910
It's just a lot
of legal semantics

40:46.912 --> 40:50.747
that's being used
to twist the truth.

40:50.749 --> 40:54.484
I loved her...
with all my heart.

40:56.455 --> 40:58.121
Thank you, doctor.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.825
Dr. Lowenstein,

41:01.826 --> 41:04.093
do you consider yourself
a good husband and father?

41:04.095 --> 41:05.562
Yes, I do.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.696
A good provider?

41:06.698 --> 41:08.665
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.500
Shelter, food, clothing?

41:10.502 --> 41:11.634
Of course.

41:11.636 --> 41:12.702
And cocaine?

41:12.704 --> 41:13.570
Objection, Your Honor.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.838
Where is this going?

41:14.840 --> 41:16.473
Mr. Stone?

41:16.475 --> 41:18.508
STONE:
To the heart
of the matter, Your Honor.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.176
The people contend

41:20.178 --> 41:22.212
that Dr. Lowenstein
is guilty of murder

41:22.214 --> 41:24.431
because he instigated
the beating

41:24.432 --> 41:26.649
and then did nothing to help
his fatally-injured daughter.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.751
We've heard
Mrs. Lowenstein testify

41:28.753 --> 41:30.687
that she was loaded on cocaine.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.922
Where did she get it?

41:36.595 --> 41:38.495
Answer the question.

41:38.497 --> 41:39.829
What<i> is</i> the question?

41:39.831 --> 41:42.899
Did you provide Carla Lowenstein
with cocaine?

41:42.901 --> 41:46.636
I've treated many of my patients
with psycho mimetic drugs.

41:46.638 --> 41:49.639
But you're not a medical doctor,
are you, doctor?

41:49.641 --> 41:50.874
You're a psychotherapist.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.709
You have no license
to prescribe medicines

41:52.711 --> 41:54.577
and have been
doing it for years

41:54.579 --> 41:58.214
and have been illegally
selling drugs to your patients.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.816
Now this is just legal semantics

41:59.818 --> 42:01.718
but some people
think it's important.

42:03.288 --> 42:07.924
Do you consider your wife
a patient?

42:07.926 --> 42:11.160
I think of my wife
as a very sick person.

42:11.162 --> 42:12.729
I tried to help her.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.864
By beating some sense into her?

42:14.866 --> 42:17.667
REDDING:
Objection.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.302
Sustained.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.904
Mr. Stone.

42:24.676 --> 42:26.276
Haven't you

42:26.278 --> 42:28.244
denied help
to your family?

42:28.246 --> 42:29.646
No.

42:29.648 --> 42:30.914
Didi was malnourished,
Dr. Lowenstein.

42:30.916 --> 42:33.182
She was seen walking
barefoot in February.

42:33.184 --> 42:36.019
I buy her shoes
and Carla throws them away.

42:36.021 --> 42:37.887
Would Carla also
throw the food away?

42:37.889 --> 42:39.989
Didi won't eat without me.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.591
She adores me.

42:41.593 --> 42:42.992
We hold hands.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.562
When?

42:45.564 --> 42:48.932
When we go out walking together.

42:48.934 --> 42:54.938
I mean, Didi gives me her hand
and says, "Tighter, Daddy.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.674
Daddy, hold me tighter."

42:57.676 --> 42:58.908
Yes, it was testified earlier

42:58.910 --> 43:00.710
that you and Didi
would walk together

43:00.712 --> 43:02.312
and Mrs. Lowenstein
would walk behind.

43:02.314 --> 43:03.646
Is that correct?

43:03.648 --> 43:05.281
Yes.

43:05.283 --> 43:08.217
Which many experts
on child abuse believe

43:08.219 --> 43:10.353
is a clear sign that the child

43:10.355 --> 43:13.790
is trying to curry favor
with the abusing parent.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.658
REDDING:
Objection.

43:15.660 --> 43:17.627
JUDGE:
Is that a question,
Mr. Stone?

43:17.629 --> 43:20.230
No, Your Honor, it's not.

43:20.231 --> 43:22.832
Do you have any more<i> questions</i>
<i> for the defendant, Mr. Stone?</i>

43:22.834 --> 43:24.701
Yes, Your Honor, yes, I do.

43:24.703 --> 43:26.636
I most certainly do.

43:26.638 --> 43:30.607
Dr. Lowenstein,
you have previously testified

43:30.609 --> 43:32.942
that when you came home
just before midnight,

43:32.944 --> 43:36.279
Carla told you that she had hit
Didi earlier that evening.

43:36.281 --> 43:38.298
Is that correct?

43:38.299 --> 43:40.316
I certainly didn't
think it was anything serious.

43:40.318 --> 43:42.752
And you also testified
that when you came home,

43:42.754 --> 43:45.288
Didi was laying in the middle
of your living room floor

43:45.290 --> 43:46.689
in her school clothes.

43:46.691 --> 43:48.658
I thought she was sleeping.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.927
Does she usually spend the night
on a parquet floor

43:50.929 --> 43:52.362
without a blanket?

43:52.364 --> 43:54.364
Of course not.

43:54.366 --> 43:57.100
Did you go to Didi and check

43:57.102 --> 43:59.702
to see if she
was all right?

43:59.704 --> 44:02.105
I... I didn't feel
it was necessary.

44:02.107 --> 44:04.674
Even with a bloodstain
under her head?

44:04.676 --> 44:06.376
I didn't see that.

44:06.378 --> 44:08.395
Oh, please, sir

44:08.396 --> 44:10.413
I direct you to examine
People's exhibit #37.

44:10.415 --> 44:12.749
It is a photograph
of a bloodstain

44:12.751 --> 44:14.717
on your living room floor...

44:14.719 --> 44:18.855
A bloodstain measuring
27 inches by 38 inches

44:18.857 --> 44:20.957
A blood stain the size
of a small rug.

44:20.959 --> 44:22.425
It was dark.

44:22.427 --> 44:25.061
There wasn't many lights about,
and, um...

44:25.063 --> 44:28.064
So when you saw your unconscious
daughter on the floor

44:28.066 --> 44:29.432
and that stain on the same floor

44:29.434 --> 44:31.000
did you pick up a phone
and call 911?

44:31.002 --> 44:32.402
I already
told you...

44:32.404 --> 44:34.070
Did you pick up a phone
and call her pediatrician?

44:34.072 --> 44:36.739
You're twisting
everything I say!

44:36.741 --> 44:39.008
Did you even bother
to pick up Didi

44:39.010 --> 44:43.146
or did you leave her
in a pool of her own blood?

44:58.730 --> 45:01.898
As eloquent as your counsel was
in your behalf

45:01.900 --> 45:04.801
you are not the victim here,
Mrs. Lowenstein.

45:04.803 --> 45:08.705
The victim was an innocent
six-year-old girl

45:08.707 --> 45:11.174
who couldn't defend herself.

45:11.176 --> 45:14.777
On a count of manslaughter
in the first degree

45:14.779 --> 45:18.047
the court sentences you
to seven to ten years

45:18.049 --> 45:20.450
in a women's correctional
facility.

45:20.452 --> 45:22.351
As for you, sir,

45:22.353 --> 45:24.187
from this seat

45:24.189 --> 45:29.492
I thought I had witnessed
every degradation,

45:29.494 --> 45:32.428
every monstrosity possible,

45:32.430 --> 45:36.065
but you, doctor,
are beyond contempt.

45:36.067 --> 45:40.136
You have helped a woman
destroy herself.

45:40.138 --> 45:45.475
You engineered the tragedy
of a little girl's death

45:45.477 --> 45:50.012
but you took pretty good care
of yourself, didn't you?

45:50.014 --> 45:53.850
Your Honor,
I've lost my family...

45:53.852 --> 45:55.218
Yes, you have.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.853
Jacob Lowenstein

45:56.855 --> 46:01.390
having been found guilty
of murder in the second degree

46:01.392 --> 46:04.427
by depraved indifference
to human life

46:04.429 --> 46:07.964
this court sentences you
to 25 years to life

46:07.966 --> 46:10.032
in a state penitentiary.

46:15.874 --> 46:19.108
Baby, what's going
to happen to us now?

46:26.451 --> 46:30.520
Pookie can't live
without her daddy.

46:30.522 --> 46:33.523
Pookie needs you.

46:33.525 --> 46:35.191
Pookie needs you.
