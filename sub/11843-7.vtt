- It's awful.
- When? When did it happen?

16:12.936 --> 16:15.962

33:24.634 --> 33:26.830
with two girls yakking.

33:26.903 --> 33:29.099
Interesting.
Um, Michael,you know...

33:29.172 --> 33:31.869
some women of the 20th century
might find that last remark...

33:31.941 --> 33:35.571
-just a tad bit offensive.
- Why?

33:36.646 --> 33:38.740
Why?

33:38.815 --> 33:41.113
Welcome to Michael-land.

33:41.184 --> 33:43.243
I hope you intend
to pay for that.

33:44.354 --> 33:47.688
- I do not.
- Then that's theft, buddy.

33:48.925 --> 33:51.292
Arrest me.

33:52.495 --> 33:55.795
<i>Okay, so what's with
the Tabasco sauce?</i>

33:57.600 --> 33:59.591
Sweet and spicy.

33:59.669 --> 34:01.603
Sweet and spicy?

34:01.671 --> 34:05.869
We all like things extremely sweet
mixed with extremely spicy.

34:05.942 --> 34:08.309
It's our little dietary quirk.

34:09.446 --> 34:13.349
Well, I'll have to, uh,
keep that in mind.

34:14.417 --> 34:16.545
You do that.

34:21.591 --> 34:23.581
Are you two flirting?

34:23.659 --> 34:27.654
Oh, God, could my life
get any worse?

34:33.770 --> 34:37.603
Um, Eddie, how much-
how much further is it?

34:37.674 --> 34:39.608
It's very close.

34:39.676 --> 34:43.476
Max, I don't think this is a good idea.
We've been walking for too long.

34:43.545 --> 34:46.174
Eddie, um, where exactly
are you taking us?

34:46.248 --> 34:49.742
- You're here.
- We're where?

34:49.819 --> 34:51.810
Good luck.

34:51.888 --> 34:54.414
No, Eddie. Eddie.
You can't just leave us here.

34:54.491 --> 34:58.655
<i>[ Max]
Hey. Hey, Eddie.</i>

34:58.728 --> 35:02.289
Wh- What are we gonna do?

35:03.533 --> 35:06.127
Frickin' Eddie.

35:06.202 --> 35:09.103
I cannot believe this.

35:09.172 --> 35:12.506
No, Max. Max, look.

35:12.575 --> 35:15.237
[Both Panting]

35:23.720 --> 35:25.654
- <i>[ Thud]</i>
- <i>[Max] What was that?</i>

35:25.722 --> 35:27.690
<i>- [Liz Screams] Let me go!
- Liz!</i>

35:27.757 --> 35:31.022
<i>- Liz, where are you?
- [Liz Screams]</i>

35:36.799 --> 35:38.733
<i>[ Max]
Let her go.</i>

35:38.801 --> 35:41.429
<i>[ Liz Panting ]</i>

35:44.307 --> 35:46.241
Who are you?

35:48.811 --> 35:51.906
You have passed the test.

35:52.982 --> 35:55.644
I've never taken you
for a drinker.

35:55.718 --> 35:59.416
- Why's that?
- You seem like the healthy type.

35:59.489 --> 36:01.651
You know, working out at the gym.

36:01.724 --> 36:04.022
Shopping the health food aisles.

36:05.194 --> 36:07.356
How long have you been
following me, Sheriff?

36:07.430 --> 36:09.398
Awhile now.

36:09.465 --> 36:11.433
Observe anything unusual?

36:11.501 --> 36:16.337
Well, besides an F.B.l. agent being
assigned to our local high school...

36:16.406 --> 36:18.101
yes, I have.

36:18.174 --> 36:22.543
That's a hell of a kickyou've got going.
About gave me a concussion.

36:22.612 --> 36:26.242
It's a good thing
I'm not the sensitive type.

36:26.316 --> 36:28.250
Aren't you?
It seems to me...

36:28.318 --> 36:31.253
a man who spends his entire life trying to
avenge his father's mistakes...

36:31.321 --> 36:34.256
could be considered sensitive.

36:36.359 --> 36:39.522
Oh, I wouldn't worry too much
about my father's mistakes...

36:39.596 --> 36:41.894
if I were you, Agent Topolsky.

36:41.965 --> 36:44.457
Seems you've made
a few of your own.

36:44.534 --> 36:46.298
Such as?

36:46.369 --> 36:50.431
Well, such as letting them
slip through your fingers.

36:50.506 --> 36:53.908
- Them?
- Whoever it is you're after.

36:53.977 --> 36:59.211
Such as, exposing yourself
to the local.

37:01.951 --> 37:04.215
Maybe we're taking
the wrong tack here, Sheriff.

37:04.287 --> 37:08.349
It's funny how everybody agrees
they've taken the wrong tack...

37:08.424 --> 37:10.824
when their cover's been blown.

37:10.825 --> 37:10.848
When their cover's been blown.

37:11.992 --> 37:14.461
Well, anyway...

37:14.528 --> 37:16.519
I just thought
I'd give you a heads-up...

37:16.597 --> 37:20.465
before I call your superiors
and let them know you've been made.

37:23.103 --> 37:25.037
Sheriff.

37:29.510 --> 37:32.138
If my superiors find out about this,
I'm off the case.

37:32.213 --> 37:36.172
I'm gone for good.
And where does that leave you?

37:36.250 --> 37:39.880
Isn't there some other way
we can work this out?

37:39.954 --> 37:42.980
Why, whatever could you be
thinking, Ms. Topolsky?

37:43.057 --> 37:45.116
[Chuckles]

37:45.192 --> 37:48.321
I probably have information
that you would like to have.

37:48.395 --> 37:52.093
You have information
that I might want.

37:52.166 --> 37:54.635
Maybe we could
work together here.

37:58.138 --> 38:00.630
Let me think about that.

38:02.776 --> 38:05.507
I once knew someone like you.

38:07.014 --> 38:10.746
I didn't know where he came from
or why he was here.

38:11.952 --> 38:14.387
Stayed pretty much to himself.

38:16.457 --> 38:21.520
But he befriended me
and everyone here.

38:21.595 --> 38:23.529
He began to trust me.

38:25.199 --> 38:27.190
Do you know
where I can find him?

38:27.268 --> 38:29.703
I haven't seen him for 4O years.

38:31.405 --> 38:34.864
<i>Besides me,
the only man he trusted...</i>

38:34.942 --> 38:36.876
was Atherton.

38:39.546 --> 38:43.005
The man gave Atherton
his necklace.

38:43.083 --> 38:45.313
<i>The one you had.</i>

38:45.386 --> 38:47.684
What happened to him?

38:47.755 --> 38:50.816
Atherton was murdered.

38:50.891 --> 38:53.588
Who killed him?

38:53.661 --> 38:56.426
The man killed him.

38:58.999 --> 39:02.094
Maybe he was defending himself.

39:02.169 --> 39:06.663
Atherton was some kind
of U.F.O. nut.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.766
He could have been trying
to expose him, hurt him.

39:09.843 --> 39:12.574
I was too far away
to see what happened.

39:12.646 --> 39:15.707
But when I reached them,
Atherton was dead.

39:18.419 --> 39:21.047
When was this?

39:21.121 --> 39:24.716
November 1959.

39:24.792 --> 39:28.194
Max.

39:28.262 --> 39:32.165
I have one more thing
to show you. This way.

39:38.539 --> 39:40.667
This is taking too long.
They're in trouble.

39:40.741 --> 39:43.210
- Cool yourjets.
- We should go out there.

39:43.277 --> 39:45.974
- They'll follow us.
- What are we supposed to do?

39:46.046 --> 39:48.913
- We wait.
- Now I know why Isabel left.

39:48.983 --> 39:51.418
You're obviously the last person
to be around in a crisis.

39:51.485 --> 39:54.011
We were told to sit here and wait
until they come back. All right?

39:54.088 --> 39:56.785
And that's what I'm doing. I'm not
the one freaking out. You're freaking out.

39:56.857 --> 39:59.019
I am not freaking out!

39:59.093 --> 40:01.960
You keep pouring sugar from one container
to the other and then back again.

40:02.029 --> 40:04.088
Quit it.
It's driving me insane.

40:04.164 --> 40:06.656
- I wish you would say something.
- What do you want me to say?

40:06.734 --> 40:09.431
I don't know what.
just say something to make me feel calm...

40:09.503 --> 40:11.437
to make me feel like
it's gonna be all right.

40:11.505 --> 40:13.439
Maybe it's not gonna
be all right.

40:13.507 --> 40:15.441
- Thanks. That helps a ton.
- What do you want me to do?

40:15.509 --> 40:17.443
- I don't know!
- Shut up then!

40:17.511 --> 40:19.445
- I hate you!
- Ditto!

40:19.513 --> 40:22.312
All I ask of you is just to try
to make me feel better.

40:22.383 --> 40:25.478
You know,
be a guy or whatever.

40:25.552 --> 40:30.285
Forget it. I'm obviously trying
to bark up the wrong tree.

40:30.357 --> 40:32.291
[Sighs]

40:45.606 --> 40:49.042
- That was to calm you down.
- Thanks.

40:59.086 --> 41:02.112
- Did he draw this?
- Yes.

41:02.189 --> 41:04.521
He said someday you would come.

41:05.759 --> 41:08.285
It seems familiar.

41:08.362 --> 41:10.353
Like I know what it means.

41:11.765 --> 41:13.699
But I can't remember.

41:13.767 --> 41:15.997
It must be
some sort of language.

41:16.070 --> 41:19.165
He was afraid
they were going to kill him.

41:19.239 --> 41:22.504
<i>- Who was?
- I don? know.</i>

41:22.576 --> 41:27.514
He felt they were close to finding him,
so he had to leave.

41:27.581 --> 41:31.347
I promised I would never share this
information with anyone...

41:31.418 --> 41:33.648
unless they passed the test.

41:33.720 --> 41:37.179
Has anyone else come?
Has anyone passed?

41:37.257 --> 41:39.453
No. No one.

41:40.627 --> 41:42.561
So this has some type of meaning.

41:42.629 --> 41:44.996
<i>It's some kind of message for us.</i>

41:45.065 --> 41:47.432
<i>Maybe it's some type of warning.</i>

41:48.836 --> 41:51.999
I don't know.
It's time for you to leave.

41:54.308 --> 41:56.242
Can I come again?

41:56.310 --> 41:58.244
[Groans]

41:59.880 --> 42:04.078
[Sighs]
I've completed my promise.

42:04.151 --> 42:08.884
<i>There's nothing more I can tell you.
Nothing more you can learn.</i>

42:12.159 --> 42:16.187
Wait. Wait.
You're not one of them.

42:18.966 --> 42:21.799
Liz.

42:21.869 --> 42:24.099
Make sure he deserves your trust.

42:24.171 --> 42:26.868
<i>Let's go.</i>
