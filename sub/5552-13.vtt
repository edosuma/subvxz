00:02.170 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:04.506 --> 00:07.509
<i>Last night,
some psycho froze a cop to death.</i>

00:07.717 --> 00:09.844
<i>He was using
super-cooled liquid helium.</i>

00:10.011 --> 00:11.513
It's one of the most effective substances
in the world

00:11.680 --> 00:12.847
for rapid temperature reduction.

00:13.014 --> 00:16.309
He just wants to know where it comes from
so we can track down the guy.

00:16.518 --> 00:18.269
- You confess to murder?
- Yes, I do.

00:18.603 --> 00:21.272
I'm not a criminal, you know.
I'm just insane.

00:21.564 --> 00:23.775
- I almost crossed the line tonight.
- How out of character.

00:23.942 --> 00:25.819
- Scared me a little.
- Welcome to my world.

00:26.111 --> 00:28.279
- I can freeze you, like we planned.
- But?

00:28.571 --> 00:29.656
I can't bring you back.

00:29.948 --> 00:32.409
Solution A14.
No, no, no, no.

00:35.912 --> 00:38.748
<i>I'm just thinking of all those
poor mice you're experimenting on.</i>

00:38.998 --> 00:41.292
What're you gonna do now?
Look for this Malone guy yourself?

00:41.459 --> 00:43.044
Honestly,
I haven't thought that far ahead.

00:45.296 --> 00:46.339
Nora.

00:47.841 --> 00:50.009
You are gonna help save my wife.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.886
<i>My husband did terrible things.</i>

00:52.303 --> 00:54.264
<i>But he did those terrible things
for my sake.</i>

00:54.514 --> 00:56.725
I'm dying. He wants to save me.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.353
I'd like to make a confession.
I'm the man that's been freezing people.

01:00.645 --> 01:02.647
A16. It worked.

01:02.856 --> 01:04.566
- Am I dead?
<i>- I can't believe it worked.</i>

01:04.983 --> 01:07.318
I'm coming for you, Nora.
I'm coming to save you.

01:33.511 --> 01:34.846
Where is everybody?

01:36.347 --> 01:37.557
Listen up!

01:37.974 --> 01:42.187
Ace Chemicals makes the liquid helium
Victor Fries uses to power his weaponry.

01:42.395 --> 01:44.939
Fries was spotted
entering the building 20 minutes ago.

01:45.273 --> 01:49.694
He's desperate and extremely dangerous.
Let's do this.

02:28.900 --> 02:29.984
Damn.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.548
What the hell happened here?

02:56.135 --> 02:58.763
Night janitor. Could be a hostage.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.181
Detectives.

03:05.562 --> 03:08.314
Canisters gone.
Looks like he got what he was after.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.608
What's he planning?

03:18.199 --> 03:19.659
"Free my wife."

03:36.134 --> 03:37.468
How was Switzerland?

03:38.761 --> 03:41.306
There are mountains, snow,

03:41.973 --> 03:43.474
people are polite.

03:44.976 --> 03:47.729
Alfred said you wanted to talk to me.

03:49.314 --> 03:52.692
Alfred wanted me to speak with you.
He's worried about you.

03:53.318 --> 03:56.362
He's worried that you might be concealing
any trauma you must be feeling.

03:57.322 --> 03:58.489
He needn't worry.

03:58.990 --> 04:02.160
I tell him I'm fine, which I am,
and he doesn't believe me.

04:02.994 --> 04:04.329
You were violently abducted.

04:04.579 --> 04:06.873
You nearly died.
You must have been very scared.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.669
It's normal to feel trauma,
it's nothing you need to be ashamed of.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.630
I wasn't scared.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.341
No? What did you feel?

04:18.259 --> 04:22.013
I felt alive. Intensely alive.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.852
Do you think I'm abnormal?

04:28.394 --> 04:31.606
You're certainly unusual.
If you're being honest.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.776
I'm always honest.

04:35.944 --> 04:38.071
That's a good way to be.

04:38.363 --> 04:41.324
- Tough to pull off.
- I try.

04:41.699 --> 04:45.411
- And how do you feel now?
- As I say, I feel fine.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.246
Invigorated.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.709
I have a second chance at life.

04:53.086 --> 04:55.296
What do you plan to do with that chance?

04:55.755 --> 04:57.215
My plans remain unchanged.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.218
Find the man who killed my parents.

05:00.969 --> 05:02.720
Bruce, you need closure.

05:04.597 --> 05:05.848
Exactly.

05:06.557 --> 05:11.771
Closure. Not a dangerous
and possibly endless obsession.

05:13.189 --> 05:14.357
I'll find him.

05:14.607 --> 05:16.734
You're a schoolboy,
not a homicide detective.

05:16.985 --> 05:19.529
I believe people can be
two things at once. Don't you think so?

05:20.488 --> 05:25.326
Yes, they can. So, you find the culprit.
What then?

05:28.413 --> 05:29.914
I'll let the law take its course.

05:30.915 --> 05:35.169
- Is that the truthful answer?
- It's the answer I'm giving you.

05:35.545 --> 05:39.590
- What happened to Honest Bruce?
- That's a very good question.

05:45.221 --> 05:46.889
I guess that's the other Bruce.

05:49.350 --> 05:52.228
Sorry. I don't mean
to be flippant with you.

05:52.937 --> 05:57.358
This conversation
has been very useful. Clarifying.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.820
Perhaps we can do it again sometime.

06:01.279 --> 06:03.114
Sure. We can do that.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.911
"Free my wife?"

06:09.245 --> 06:12.707
This guy thinks by killing seven cops,
he can get us to free his wife?

06:12.957 --> 06:15.293
I'll free my boot up his frozen ass!

06:15.626 --> 06:19.464
Tin can lunatic son of a bitch,
I'll tear his...

06:19.672 --> 06:21.549
I'm gonna take a breath.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.845
Well, what about the hostage, the janitor?
Any demands?

06:26.179 --> 06:27.180
Not yet.

06:27.472 --> 06:28.806
Obviously, we're dealing with a madman

06:29.015 --> 06:30.808
and once he realizes
that we're not gonna release his wife,

06:31.017 --> 06:33.728
he's gonna come to us,
try to get her, right?

06:33.978 --> 06:35.146
What else would he do?

06:35.688 --> 06:38.316
- I guess.
- When he does, we'll be ready for him

06:39.067 --> 06:40.276
and we'll take him.

06:40.902 --> 06:42.653
- Where is she now?
- In a holding cell.

06:42.904 --> 06:44.322
Lee and a paramedic are seeing to her.

06:44.739 --> 06:47.575
Lee says if she doesn't move
to a hospital soon, she could die.

06:48.034 --> 06:49.035
Damn it.

06:49.452 --> 06:52.538
We can't secure Gotham General.
It's too many access points.

06:52.789 --> 06:54.123
Too many civilians.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.711
Arkham.
They have a full ER facility, right?

06:59.003 --> 07:00.171
We'll take her to Arkham.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.006
<i>This way, she can get the care she needs</i>

07:02.340 --> 07:05.384
and we can capture Fries
without endangering any civilians.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.637
- Makes sense.
- Sense?

07:07.929 --> 07:11.432
It's a lunatic asylum
filled with crazy people.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.685
- You got any better ideas?
- No.

07:15.353 --> 07:18.147
You prep her to travel.
I'll call the director at Arkham.

07:18.397 --> 07:21.526
And get that out to the press.
I want Fries taking the bait.

07:22.026 --> 07:25.696
I'll gonna let you tell Lee that
we're taking her patient to the nut house.

07:26.072 --> 07:28.282
- She'll understand.
- Oh, yeah. Totally. Completely.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.076
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

07:30.368 --> 07:34.205
You plan on using a dying woman as bait?
A tethered goat? At Arkham?

07:34.539 --> 07:35.540
It's not like that.

07:35.832 --> 07:37.708
Are you going to tell her husband
where you're taking her?

07:38.376 --> 07:40.294
- Yes, but--
- Then it is like that.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.047
It's the least bad of several bad options.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.050
We could spread false word
that she's at Gotham General,

07:46.300 --> 07:48.010
but what happens when Fries attacks?

07:48.261 --> 07:50.263
It's filled with people
who are too sick to move.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.889
This is the rational way to go.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.308
Sometimes, the rational way
is not the best way.

07:55.226 --> 07:56.936
If there were better way,
we would take it.

07:57.228 --> 08:00.690
Just trust me,
Nora Fries will be perfectly safe.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.653
- I got to go.
- I'm going with her.

08:06.237 --> 08:07.697
Lee, there are doctors at Arkham.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.282
She is my patient.

08:09.574 --> 08:11.784
I used to work there.
I know those doctors. I'm going.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.161
It's not safe.

08:13.411 --> 08:15.413
It's safe for Nora,
but it's not safe for me?

08:15.746 --> 08:17.999
- No, now, now, now, look--
- Yeah. Keep thinking, hotshot.

08:18.249 --> 08:20.418
- I'm gonna get my stuff.
- No. You know what I meant.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.421
If you use this on me, I'm gonna scream.

08:43.733 --> 08:44.984
Who was that?

08:45.401 --> 08:46.903
One of Fries' victims.

08:47.612 --> 08:52.033
I'd hoped to extract traces of
Fries' formula from the man's tissue,

08:52.366 --> 08:54.202
but no such luck.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.162
Speaking of, you had a call.

08:56.454 --> 09:00.458
The GCPD wants to transfer Nora Fries
to Arkham medical wing.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.210
You mean, the wife?

09:02.627 --> 09:04.128
<i>Apparently, she's very sick.</i>

09:04.378 --> 09:06.923
The police think
Fries may try to break her out.

09:07.298 --> 09:09.800
They need a more secure medical location.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.263
Fries must be doing all this
to save his wife.

09:15.806 --> 09:17.141
How romantic.

09:17.683 --> 09:18.726
<i>How perfect.</i>

09:18.893 --> 09:22.146
Here I am, desperately in need
of his cryonic expertise

09:22.313 --> 09:24.440
and he's going to make a house call.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.656
The fates are smiling on us.

09:32.198 --> 09:34.492
Swiftly, Peabody, we must prepare.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.210
...<i>having recovered
from being frozen solid</i>

09:44.543 --> 09:47.838
<i>before stumbling out
to the bewilderment of the GCPD.</i>

09:48.089 --> 09:50.007
<i>He was taken to Gotham Memorial,</i>

09:50.174 --> 09:52.802
<i>where he was treated for minor injuries
and released.</i>

09:53.010 --> 09:57.181
<i>We are now getting word that Nora Fries,
wife of the infamous Mr. Freeze,</i>

09:57.431 --> 10:00.184
<i>is being taken to the medical wing
of Arkham Asylum.</i>

10:00.518 --> 10:02.395
Arkham?

10:02.645 --> 10:06.816
She belongs in a hospital.
Not thrown in among lunatics.

10:09.193 --> 10:12.571
It's a trap. Of course it is.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.032
They're using her to get to me!

10:15.616 --> 10:19.203
The fools. They think
walls and guns can stop me?

10:21.956 --> 10:23.374
They have no idea.

10:35.553 --> 10:37.555
They'll learn.

10:55.573 --> 10:56.991
Let me go, you brutes!

11:00.745 --> 11:04.707
- I want to speak to Professor Strange.
- Director Strange is very busy today.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.501
<i>But rest assured,
nothing happens at Arkham</i>

11:07.752 --> 11:09.420
not according to his wishes.

11:09.587 --> 11:12.298
What is this thing?
What're you doing to me?

11:12.590 --> 11:15.217
You're to be the face
of our rehabilitation program.

11:15.468 --> 11:18.929
If we can cure a man like
Oswald Cobblepot, we can cure anyone.

11:20.681 --> 11:24.769
I refuse.
I refuse to be part of your program.

11:25.019 --> 11:27.897
- You have no choice.
- Know this, woman.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.359
Nobody yet has failed to regret
vexing the Penguin,

11:31.942 --> 11:34.487
and you are vexing me!

11:36.822 --> 11:38.616
Oh.

11:40.451 --> 11:43.579
Make your next decision very carefully.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.746
Duck.

12:26.914 --> 12:27.957
Duck.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.292
Duck.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.423
<i>Duck.</i>

12:36.632 --> 12:37.675
<i>Duck.</i>

12:39.468 --> 12:40.469
<i>Duck.</i>

12:41.554 --> 12:44.974
- Thank God. It was only a dream.
<i>- Duck.</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:46.851
It was only a dream.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.227
<i>Goose!</i>

12:49.395 --> 12:50.479
You're supposed to chase me.

12:52.565 --> 12:53.649
You're the goose.

12:54.567 --> 12:57.153
No, no. I'm a...

12:58.320 --> 12:59.321
I'm the...

12:59.697 --> 13:01.073
I'm a penguin.

13:01.991 --> 13:04.368
Goose! Goose!

13:05.244 --> 13:07.621
Goose! Goose!

13:08.164 --> 13:11.292
- Problem?
- He's not being the goose.

13:12.293 --> 13:15.379
<i>It's fun to participate
in group, Mr. Cobblepot.</i>

13:15.629 --> 13:17.006
You should try.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.051
Yes.

13:21.594 --> 13:23.804
Yes, I'd be glad to.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.559
What is it they want me to do?

13:29.894 --> 13:31.395
Be the goose.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.397
Okay.

13:51.499 --> 13:53.292
Sweet Mother. Is that Penguin?

13:53.667 --> 13:54.668
<i>Duck.</i>

13:56.253 --> 13:57.296
Duck.

13:57.588 --> 13:58.631
<i>Seems drugged.</i>

13:58.881 --> 14:00.883
<i>He's been quite agitated
since he arrived.</i>

14:01.133 --> 14:03.594
We put him on a mild sedative
to keep him from hurting himself.

14:04.553 --> 14:08.224
Dr. Thompkins, my assistant, Miss Peabody,
will accompany you to the infirmary.

14:09.058 --> 14:11.185
<i>- She can provide whatever you need.</i>
- Thank you.

14:12.353 --> 14:13.562
<i>Duck.</i>

14:14.355 --> 14:15.397
<i>Duck.</i>

14:17.691 --> 14:18.692
<i>Duck.</i>

14:19.276 --> 14:20.778
We'll set up by the main gate.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.947
You should probably get
the inmates back in their cells.

14:23.906 --> 14:24.907
<i>Duck.</i>

14:25.533 --> 14:26.534
Duck.

14:28.369 --> 14:29.995
- Duck.
<i>- Harv, come on.</i>

14:31.330 --> 14:32.456
<i>Duck.</i>

14:34.458 --> 14:35.459
<i>Duck.</i>

14:37.294 --> 14:38.420
<i>Duck.</i>

14:45.219 --> 14:49.390
I trust you won't mind sharing the wing
with our dear Miss Kean.

14:49.682 --> 14:51.350
You've got to be kidding me.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.811
Oh, do you know Sleeping Beauty?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.479
That's my name for her.

14:56.063 --> 15:00.192
So lovely, so still. Like an angel.

15:00.776 --> 15:01.777
Uh-huh.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.404
Is there a problem?

15:03.946 --> 15:05.823
No. No problem at all.

15:13.372 --> 15:17.334
Pinkney, I want obstacles set up to keep
Fries from getting to the main building.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.003
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- What about the bus?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.171
Yeah, good idea.

15:21.672 --> 15:24.091
And, Harvey,
I want a shooter up on that roof.

15:25.301 --> 15:28.637
Jim? Jim, Jim, my old friend!

15:28.887 --> 15:32.433
- Jim. Help, please.
- Wait! Wait.

15:37.313 --> 15:38.731
Give us a minute.

15:40.399 --> 15:45.154
Thank God you're here.
You have to help me. They're torturing me.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.781
Torture is what you do.

15:47.990 --> 15:51.452
- The doctors here are trying to help you.
- It's torture, I'm telling you.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.747
- I don't see any signs of it.
- It's mental torture.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.417
It's therapy. You're insane, remember?

15:59.293 --> 16:01.420
That's what your lawyers said anyhow.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.214
<i>Goodbye, Penguin.</i>

16:05.633 --> 16:09.053
You owe me, Jim Gordon. I lied for you!

16:10.220 --> 16:13.390
He killed Galavan! Not me! It was him!

16:13.724 --> 16:14.767
<i>It was him!</i>

16:15.142 --> 16:18.604
<i>You owe me, Jim Gordon. I lied for you!</i>

16:19.855 --> 16:22.566
<i>He killed Galavan! Not me! It was him!</i>

16:23.192 --> 16:25.527
<i>It was him! It was him!</i>

16:35.537 --> 16:37.665
I should say,
that's learned him, Master Bruce.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.960
We're supposed to have a training session.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.546
Yeah.
Well, I got held up in the city, didn't I?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.549
Besides, I thought your chat with
Dr. Thompkins would keep you occupied.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.468
And I thought you were against therapy.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.930
Well, that's before I realized
you're still keen on keeping secrets.

16:53.097 --> 16:55.599
If I'd told you what Selina and I
had planned, you would have stopped me.

16:55.766 --> 16:58.435
Because I didn't, I got the name
of my parents' killer from Silver.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.271
Then you made us leave Gotham.

17:01.605 --> 17:03.941
We lost more than a month we could have
spent searching for M. Malone.

17:04.274 --> 17:07.778
We left the city because you were at the
end of your emotional and physical rope,

17:08.028 --> 17:11.782
and quite frankly, you're incapable of
catching a common cold let alone a killer.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.450
Will you stop?

17:15.494 --> 17:18.288
Now, I need to ask you
a very important question.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.543
Are we in this together,

17:25.045 --> 17:26.046
or not?

17:27.965 --> 17:28.966
Yes.

17:30.467 --> 17:31.760
We're in this together.

17:32.803 --> 17:35.389
Right, well, I told you
I had some business in the city.

17:36.014 --> 17:39.643
I went to see a sergeant I know and
we did some digging in some GCPD files

17:40.310 --> 17:42.187
for any M. Malones
that fit our particulars.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.648
Age, size, height, race.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.943
Whether they were free
during the murder of your parents.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.570
And?

17:57.453 --> 17:58.912
Patrick Malone.

18:00.622 --> 18:04.168
Goes by the nickname "Matches."

18:05.252 --> 18:08.130
<i>Delightful chap, really.
Committed his first murder when he was 15.</i>

18:08.672 --> 18:11.008
Suspected of half a dozen since.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.593
<i>Now, I need to ask you,</i>

18:13.010 --> 18:16.972
if you were in charge, what next?

18:17.222 --> 18:19.349
You could've gotten this information
from Detective Gordon.

18:19.558 --> 18:20.559
Why didn't you contact him?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.686
I'm the one asking the questions now,
Master Bruce.

18:23.187 --> 18:26.690
We find this man, what do you plan to do?

18:33.697 --> 18:35.574
- Kill him.
- No.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.454
- You can't stop me--
- I bloody can, and I will.

18:41.121 --> 18:44.166
You're too young to have a death
on your conscience, Master Bruce.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.128
- But--
- I know how your parents deserve justice

18:48.378 --> 18:50.005
and I know you're not gonna stop
till you find it.

18:50.714 --> 18:55.177
But when we find this Malone,
I will kill him and not you.

18:55.511 --> 18:56.929
That is the deal.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.264
Do you accept?

19:02.226 --> 19:03.519
- Yes.
- Say it.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.524
We find him, we make him talk.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.902
You kill him.

19:30.796 --> 19:33.257
You have no idea what you're missing.

19:39.888 --> 19:40.889
Bitch.

19:42.516 --> 19:43.934
Where am I?

19:45.602 --> 19:47.396
- Where am I?
- Nora.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.982
Try not to exert yourself.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.651
- You're in a hospital.
- Who are you?

19:53.694 --> 19:55.153
This is not Gotham General.

19:55.612 --> 19:58.740
No. You're in a more secure place.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.618
I'm Doctor Thompkins. Lee.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.290
They're scared of Victor.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.001
Yes.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.963
Victor only did these terrible things
because of me.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.716
You're not responsible
for your husband's actions.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.384
He's not an evil man.

20:18.135 --> 20:21.597
He believes the good of saving me
outweighs the bad of his actions.

20:22.306 --> 20:23.307
I understand.

20:23.765 --> 20:25.684
But he's not my concern right now,
you are,

20:25.934 --> 20:27.311
and you have to try and stay calm.

20:27.519 --> 20:30.480
You're stable,
but you're still very fragile.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.483
I could have saved him.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.528
I saw him going down this path.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.656
Becoming more and more obsessed.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.744
Why didn't I do something?

20:46.079 --> 20:49.791
I know what you mean.
It's hard when you love someone.

20:50.959 --> 20:55.005
You see the person that they were,
the person they could still become.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.427
You close your eyes to the truth.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.433
He's coming for me, isn't he?

21:07.559 --> 21:10.145
The police think so.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.105
So stubborn, my Victor.

21:14.024 --> 21:16.193
- You're pregnant.
- Yes.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.321
Do you know yet if it's a boy or a girl?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.531
Not yet.

21:22.532 --> 21:24.368
I always wanted a girl.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.081
You shouldn't be here.

21:30.874 --> 21:34.044
Let's focus on you
and not worry about me. Okay?

21:41.176 --> 21:45.222
Winter stakeout
at the loony bin. Fabulous.

21:45.597 --> 21:49.393
Nora doesn't have long. Fries knows that.
He'll come soon.

21:49.726 --> 21:53.313
He'd better.
We could freeze to death waiting.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.148
Which would be ironic.

22:03.240 --> 22:04.908
You hear that?

22:08.203 --> 22:09.413
Take cover!

22:10.080 --> 22:12.165
<i>- Let's go. Heads up!</i>
<i>- Eyes open.</i>

22:15.877 --> 22:17.254
<i>Open fire!</i>

22:27.931 --> 22:29.850
<i>Move, move, keep going.
Get the door. Go.</i>

22:30.434 --> 22:34.688
- Hands in the air!
- I can't. I can't. Don't shoot.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.399
- Where's Victor Fries?
- I don't know!

22:37.691 --> 22:39.109
Please! Help me!

22:44.114 --> 22:45.866
Let's go. Come on.

22:51.496 --> 22:54.291
Mommy? Mommy?

22:56.960 --> 22:58.837
Mommy!

23:00.672 --> 23:01.673
Hello?

23:11.433 --> 23:12.476
Huh?

23:29.451 --> 23:31.828
Copy that.
Fries took out a wall in the east wing.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.831
Have B team cut him off.
We'll head directly to the infirmary.

23:35.082 --> 23:37.918
Alpha to Bravo. Continue pursuing suspect.
We're headed to the infirmary.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.921
Copy that. Maintaining pursuit.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.096
Take cover!

23:58.438 --> 24:00.107
Nora!

24:16.915 --> 24:18.500
What the hell?

24:18.708 --> 24:20.210
Uh-oh.

24:24.381 --> 24:25.382
Go!

25:09.759 --> 25:11.219
<i>Hello, Victor.</i>

25:11.636 --> 25:13.597
<i>Forgive me
for getting straight to the point.</i>

25:13.972 --> 25:16.099
I'm a great admirer of your work and

25:16.266 --> 25:19.269
I'd like to offer a way out
of your situation.

25:19.853 --> 25:21.605
- Who are you?
<i>- I'm a friend.</i>

25:21.897 --> 25:24.774
But let me ask you.
Once you rescue your wife,

25:25.150 --> 25:29.237
what is your plan? To steal a vehicle?
Blast your way out?

25:31.323 --> 25:33.950
There is a set of keys on the chair.

25:34.242 --> 25:37.495
<i>They belong to a vehicle
that is waiting by the loading docks.</i>

25:41.583 --> 25:44.502
- How do I know it's not a trap?
- It is not a trap.

25:45.003 --> 25:46.213
It is an exchange.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.548
<i>You get your wife and your freedom.</i>

25:48.882 --> 25:51.384
I can keep the police at bay
while you escape.

25:51.676 --> 25:57.599
As thanks, you will leave me one cartridge
of your cryonic formula.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.643
<i>What do you say?</i>

26:00.936 --> 26:02.979
<i>The police are coming,
you can't beat them all</i>

26:03.230 --> 26:07.234
and time is running out for you
and for Nora.

26:21.539 --> 26:24.167
Go fetch that, would you, Miss Peabody?

26:32.759 --> 26:34.844
Fries is in the building. We have to go.

26:35.470 --> 26:38.390
We can't leave her. The staff bailed
when the alarm went off, she'll die.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.767
So, we take her with us. Come on.

26:43.812 --> 26:44.813
Careful.

26:48.191 --> 26:49.276
Thank you.

26:55.949 --> 26:57.325
I'll take it from here.

27:04.499 --> 27:07.043
Victor, Victor listen to me.
We're trying to help her.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.586
- You're killing her.
<i>- No, no.</i>

27:08.837 --> 27:10.005
- Victor.
<i>- Victor, I understand</i>

27:10.213 --> 27:12.132
- why you're doing this.
- I'm saving her life.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.551
At the cost of how many other lives?

27:15.593 --> 27:17.095
Too many to turn back now.

27:18.388 --> 27:21.224
Soon as I've done what I need to do,
I'll give myself up.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.601
But now we have to leave.

27:23.810 --> 27:27.981
Victor, I'm a doctor, if we move her now,
she might die.

27:28.732 --> 27:30.066
A doctor, good.

27:30.567 --> 27:32.402
You're coming with us
to push the wheelchair, let's go.

27:32.652 --> 27:35.363
- No, no way!
- Jim, I'm going. She's my patient.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.615
I can't let you do that. I'll go, take me.

27:37.866 --> 27:40.076
Jim, it's not your call. She needs me.

27:41.328 --> 27:42.579
I'm not gonna hurt her.

27:43.246 --> 27:44.914
I don't wanna hurt anyone
unless I have to.

27:45.123 --> 27:49.085
- Jim, I'm going.
- Victor, please, don't do this.

27:49.336 --> 27:52.756
Nora, don't worry, it's all under control.

27:53.757 --> 27:57.260
- Help.
- We have to go, now. You, in there.

27:59.179 --> 28:02.015
- Do what he is saying. We'll be okay.
- Now!

28:03.933 --> 28:05.143
Okay.

28:15.278 --> 28:16.696
Okay, let's go.

28:31.669 --> 28:35.340
Thank you so much.

28:47.811 --> 28:49.145
<i>Lee!</i>

28:54.317 --> 28:55.318
Lee!

29:07.497 --> 29:11.000
Apologies, officers, the extreme
cold has shorted the wiring.

29:11.418 --> 29:12.460
We're working on it.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.170
<i>Well, work on it quick!</i>

29:14.421 --> 29:15.630
Oh, we are.

29:16.423 --> 29:17.674
We are.

29:19.050 --> 29:22.262
Please put that somewhere very safe,
would you, Miss Peabody?

29:23.263 --> 29:24.722
Good news, officers.

29:30.979 --> 29:33.690
Did Fries say anything,
anything at all about his plans?

29:34.023 --> 29:36.943
No, nothing. He just said sorry.

29:37.193 --> 29:40.029
Yo, partner! What'd we miss?

29:40.530 --> 29:42.157
Fries got away with Nora and Lee.

29:42.365 --> 29:44.534
I put a BOLO out on the vehicle,
but that's all we got.

29:44.868 --> 29:47.495
Fries has to put his wife on ice
as quickly as possible, right?

29:47.704 --> 29:50.498
He can't go home, there's cops
at the door. Where's he gonna go?

29:50.665 --> 29:52.750
He's got the equipment with him.
He could freeze her anywhere.

29:53.710 --> 29:57.172
Wait, now he could freeze her,
but he can't keep her frozen,

29:57.672 --> 29:59.424
not without one of those cryo chambers
he built.

29:59.716 --> 30:00.800
Then he is going home.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.927
They're still at his house,
they were never taken into evidence.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.388
It's where he went, has to be. Come on.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.741
Victor, please think about this.

30:25.283 --> 30:27.744
How will you take care of her
if you're in prison?

30:28.703 --> 30:31.247
I won't, you will. Gotham will.

30:31.789 --> 30:33.541
It's the law,
as long as she's legally alive,

30:33.750 --> 30:36.085
she's a ward of the city and
the city has to keep her alive and safe.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.046
Victor.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.757
I'm here, darling. I've brought you home.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.842
I'm so tired.

30:43.593 --> 30:46.054
I know. It will all be over soon.

30:47.597 --> 30:48.890
Victor...

30:51.434 --> 30:53.978
I want you to let me go. Let me die.

30:54.479 --> 30:58.608
Nora, you don't mean that.
I can do this, the process works.

30:58.816 --> 31:01.778
So, I should wake up one day,
with you in prison?

31:02.362 --> 31:05.657
Or dead?
A life alone isn't one that I want.

31:06.074 --> 31:09.953
I'll be there when you wake up.
I'll be there, I'll find a way, I will.

31:10.328 --> 31:11.704
There's always hope.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.041
As long as you're alive,
there's hope, right?

31:18.127 --> 31:20.713
Yes, there's hope.

31:23.007 --> 31:24.259
Okay.

31:27.136 --> 31:31.599
My necklace, the one that you gave me
on our first anniversary,

31:32.350 --> 31:36.145
it's on the night stand.
Would you get it for me please, dear?

31:38.982 --> 31:41.651
Go. I'm strong enough to use it
if I need to.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.996
If you hurry, you can make it out
before he gets back.

31:53.705 --> 31:54.998
I'm not leaving you.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.791
This must be very stressful
for you and your baby.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.376
We're fine.

31:59.419 --> 32:00.837
Could I have some water?

32:16.352 --> 32:17.645
Thank you.

32:20.565 --> 32:24.569
You heard him,
he's not a bad man at heart.

32:26.029 --> 32:28.531
- You have to tell them that.
- I will.

32:28.906 --> 32:32.535
Please tell them that I'm very sorry
for my part in this.

32:34.203 --> 32:37.415
I saw the man that he was becoming
and I did nothing.

32:40.126 --> 32:41.502
Because I loved him.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.382
You know what that's like, don't you?

32:48.259 --> 32:49.385
I do.

32:51.888 --> 32:52.889
Thank you.

32:54.557 --> 32:57.727
You've been very kind.
God bless you and your baby.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.647
Nora, I got it.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.232
I've got it.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.111
Victor.

33:09.697 --> 33:10.907
I love you.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.078
Please don't blame yourself.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.247
I love you.

33:23.086 --> 33:24.212
See you soon.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.091
You should stand back.

34:16.305 --> 34:18.808
I felt the breeze
when you came in the window.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.484
I'm glad you came. I need a favor.

34:28.735 --> 34:30.737
Nice to see you, Selina.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.364
Sorry for not telling you
that I was skipping town

34:33.573 --> 34:35.241
to go to my castle in France.

34:35.450 --> 34:38.161
- It's a chalet in Switzerland.
- Whatever.

34:39.078 --> 34:40.830
Where's the King of Snotty England?

34:41.414 --> 34:42.999
Alfred went to the city.

34:47.336 --> 34:51.507
This is the man that Silver told us about.
Alfred tracked him down.

34:54.594 --> 34:57.346
Patrick Malone.
I thought his name started with M?

34:57.805 --> 34:59.515
The M stands for "Matches,"
that's a nickname.

35:00.016 --> 35:01.434
That's a lame nickname.

35:03.019 --> 35:05.980
So, you found him.
What do you need me for?

35:06.773 --> 35:08.649
I need you to get me a gun.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.862
- So, you're gonna kill him?
- Yes.

35:13.196 --> 35:14.530
Your butler know?

35:14.864 --> 35:16.324
Alfred thinks
he's gonna be the one to kill him,

35:16.866 --> 35:18.159
that's why I'm asking you.

35:18.493 --> 35:21.704
You couldn't even push that guy
out of the window.

35:21.996 --> 35:24.916
So, how do you expect to do this?

35:27.084 --> 35:29.462
Because this man killed my parents.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.552
You ever even fired a gun before?

35:36.886 --> 35:38.387
Please, Selina,
you're the only person I can--

35:38.596 --> 35:40.389
You don't even know
what you're asking, Bruce.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.308
Yeah, sure, the guy deserves it.

35:42.642 --> 35:48.147
But doing this,
you won't ever, ever be the same.

35:52.068 --> 35:54.362
That's what I'm counting on.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.876
Crap, how'd you wanna play this one?

36:09.710 --> 36:12.797
Slow and careful,
no gun play if we can help it.

36:13.047 --> 36:15.007
Set up a perimeter, I'm gonna look inside.

36:15.383 --> 36:18.636
Roger. Perimeter. Hey, set up a perimeter.

36:24.600 --> 36:29.063
Give me one more moment, Doctor,
and I'll put myself in your charge.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.617
No. No.

36:41.993 --> 36:43.578
No, no, no, no, no!

36:43.786 --> 36:45.079
No, no, no, no, no!

36:45.496 --> 36:46.539
Nora!

36:46.831 --> 36:49.625
I don't understand, it works,
my formula works! How?

36:52.128 --> 36:53.796
She switched cartridges.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.299
She changed her cartridges?

36:59.176 --> 37:01.804
Did you know?
Did you know she switched the cartridges?

37:01.971 --> 37:02.972
No.

37:06.893 --> 37:08.561
I'm so sorry.

37:08.811 --> 37:11.981
<i>Mr. Fries,
this is the GCPD, you're surrounded.</i>

37:12.356 --> 37:16.944
<i>Please come out and give yourself up
and let's avoid any more sadness.</i>

37:18.487 --> 37:19.488
Yeah.

37:21.782 --> 37:23.326
No more sadness.

37:26.662 --> 37:28.164
Will you be very kind

37:28.873 --> 37:31.834
and go tell the police
that I will do as they say?

37:36.714 --> 37:40.843
Nora loved you very much.
I'm envious of the bond you had.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.936
GCPD. Victor?

38:37.441 --> 38:38.776
Oh, my God.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.256
Hey. You should go back to bed.

39:01.924 --> 39:03.050
Can't sleep.

39:07.054 --> 39:08.347
Heard you on the phone.

39:09.223 --> 39:13.394
Hugo Strange called.
Victor Fries died in Arkham infirmary.

39:13.978 --> 39:15.312
<i>They couldn't revive him.</i>

39:16.897 --> 39:17.898
You okay?

39:18.816 --> 39:21.277
I am. Are you?

39:25.406 --> 39:26.866
Wish you hadn't gone.

39:31.787 --> 39:33.414
Wish you hadn't put our baby at risk.

39:34.498 --> 39:37.084
You put us at risk
when you put Nora at risk.

39:37.293 --> 39:39.795
- She was under my care.
- That was different, that was police work.

39:40.046 --> 39:41.464
That was you, it's all you.

39:41.756 --> 39:44.592
Arkham was actually Barnes' idea,
but it made sense,

39:44.800 --> 39:46.927
- it was good police work.
- What about Galavan?

39:47.636 --> 39:49.221
Was that good police work, too?

39:49.930 --> 39:52.183
- What about him?
- The way he died.

39:53.184 --> 39:55.644
Whatever the truth is,
it's not what you told me.

39:55.936 --> 39:56.979
How do you know?

39:57.313 --> 39:59.648
Because I know
when you're being dishonest.

40:00.191 --> 40:02.943
And you know what?
If anybody deserves to die, it's Galavan.

40:03.319 --> 40:08.324
But don't talk to me about police work,
it's you, you lied to me.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.848
I know you say
there are no hopeless cases.

40:33.099 --> 40:34.600
And there are none.

40:35.226 --> 40:38.979
The beauty of life can spring forward
from even the harshest of climates.

40:39.355 --> 40:43.609
We simply need to be more <i>aggressive</i>
in our treatment.

40:45.027 --> 40:47.738
Now, I must go see to our newest guest.

41:04.004 --> 41:05.673
Good morning, Victor.

41:09.844 --> 41:11.095
Where am I?

41:11.470 --> 41:14.140
Legally, your corpse
is in the Arkham morgue,

41:15.558 --> 41:18.811
but obviously you're here. Indian Hill.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.564
Indian Hill is a toxic waste dump.

41:22.231 --> 41:23.899
A useful fiction.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.110
You're the one who spoke to me in Arkham.

41:26.402 --> 41:29.780
Hugo Strange.
Pleasure to meet you face to face.

41:30.406 --> 41:31.866
How is it I am not dead?

41:33.117 --> 41:34.702
It's simply astonishing, isn't it?

41:35.244 --> 41:38.539
<i>My guess is that you absorbed some of
your own formula over the past months.</i>

41:38.831 --> 41:41.333
Your body underwent
a profound cellular change,

41:41.584 --> 41:44.170
when you were brought in here,
you were actually overheating.

41:44.503 --> 41:46.922
Now look there, at the thermometer.

41:49.008 --> 41:52.386
It's negative 20 degrees
and I'm not even cold.

41:52.928 --> 41:56.765
The formula appears to have lowered
your core body temperature.

41:57.099 --> 42:00.269
You can only survive
in severe hypothermic conditions,

42:00.561 --> 42:02.771
anything above freezing will kill you.

42:03.189 --> 42:05.733
<i>But never fear,
you won't be locked in there forever.</i>

42:06.108 --> 42:09.361
We've made some modifications to your suit
to allow you to walk freely.

42:09.862 --> 42:13.115
<i>For now, rest. Tomorrow we begin work.</i>

42:13.908 --> 42:17.077
One project in particular
I think you will find fascinating.

42:17.703 --> 42:19.455
I should have died with Nora.

42:21.457 --> 42:22.958
This all should have ended.

42:23.959 --> 42:26.086
<i>Then take this opportunity, Victor,</i>

42:26.420 --> 42:28.839
pretend you did die.

42:29.924 --> 42:35.095
Death is not an ending,
death is a new beginning.

43:47.209 --> 43:48.210
