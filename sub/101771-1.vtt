11:31.791 --> 11:33.750
Yeah, I… I got it covered. Okay?

11:33.833 --> 11:35.791
-Okay, uh, love you.
-[Kate] Love you.

11:35.875 --> 11:39.125
-[inhales sharply] All right. Have fun.
-Okay, guys. See you soon.

11:39.208 --> 11:40.583
[Teddy exhales]

11:41.708 --> 11:43.791
You know,
you really don't have to check in on us.

11:43.875 --> 11:46.083
-Yeah, I wasn't planning on it.
-[girl] Teddy!

11:47.833 --> 11:48.708
See you tomorrow.

11:51.125 --> 11:55.333
Hey, um, Kate! Where are you going?
Kids Club is this way.

11:56.833 --> 11:59.458
Right. Um, yeah.

11:59.541 --> 12:01.333
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,

12:01.416 --> 12:03.458
but why don't you go ahead
and head over there,

12:03.541 --> 12:04.750
and I'll meet you in a few?

12:04.833 --> 12:06.291
I'll wait for you.

12:07.458 --> 12:10.708
Go to the Kids Club, Jack.
That is a direct babysitter's order.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.541
You're only three years older than me.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.458
But I believe in a chain of command,

12:16.541 --> 12:19.541
so I'll save you a spot
at the slime-making station.

12:37.625 --> 12:39.416
Hello.
Are you waiting for the airport shuttle?

12:39.500 --> 12:40.541
Yeah.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.541
Driver just popped a tire,
so I'm taking people over in the meantime.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.333
Okay, cool.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.833
I'm gonna take a little shortcut.
Should get us there in half the time.

your vacation isn't going so well.

13:00.541 --> 13:02.833
Ugh, it's complicated. My mom and--

13:02.916 --> 13:03.791
Say no more.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.125
My family was a real drag, too.

13:06.958 --> 13:09.375
Ran away from that nightmare
a couple years ago.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.125
Right around your age.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.291
I just thought it was best for everybody
if I wasn't even here.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.791
They can have their new little family
without me.

13:19.875 --> 13:20.708
Kate!

13:21.666 --> 13:23.125
Are you running away?

I should've brought my puffy jacket.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.833
We're gonna freeze to death out here.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.625
Don't worry, Jack. It's gonna be okay.

did we just crash through a kaleidoscope?
There were so many different colors.

Oh, no. That was just us
coming back through the Veil of Borealis.

23:06.291 --> 23:08.833
[Santa] The village houses
over a million elves.

23:09.333 --> 23:13.833
Now, if you combine Amazon,
FedEx, the postal service, and UPS

23:13.916 --> 23:16.583
with every manufacturing company
in the world,

23:16.666 --> 23:19.333
and they quadrupled their output
for an entire year,

23:19.416 --> 23:22.125
well, you just might be getting close
to what we can accomplish

23:22.208 --> 23:24.791
here in Santa's Village in a single day.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.333
So, where's your workshop?

23:26.416 --> 23:28.458
[chuckles] Why, you're walking in it.

23:28.541 --> 23:29.708
-Really?
-[laughs] Yes.

23:29.791 --> 23:32.875
Well, we have over 300,000 shops
here in the village.

23:32.958 --> 23:35.375
And each and every one
designed by Mrs. Claus.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.083
Well…

23:37.750 --> 23:40.041
[gasps, in Elvish]

23:40.625 --> 23:42.166
[in English] If she designed this place,

23:42.250 --> 23:44.250
I think it should be called
"Mrs. Claus's Village."

23:44.333 --> 23:47.916
-Me too.
-Why, I… I never thought of that.

23:48.958 --> 23:50.625
-Of course he didn't.
-[Santa] Uh…

23:50.708 --> 23:53.416
Ah, I mean, I did discover it,
and the elves built it,

23:53.500 --> 23:54.625
but, I don't know,

23:54.708 --> 23:57.208
it's been called Santa's Village
for over 1,000 years,

23:57.291 --> 23:59.083
it… it might be time for a change.

[Jack] Wow. Look at all those candy canes.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.291
Enough to stuff billions
of stockings every year.

I think you might recognize this place.

26:22.416 --> 26:24.458
-[Kate] Is that the Hall of Letters?
-[Santa] Uh-huh.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.750
[Jack] Wait a minute.
You've been here before?

26:26.833 --> 26:29.666
[Kate] Well, I've been in there,
but never out here.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.291
[Jack] How come you never told me?

26:31.375 --> 26:33.583
There's a lot of things
I haven't told you, Jack.

26:33.666 --> 26:35.125
-[Jack sighs]
-[Kate chuckles]

26:36.375 --> 26:38.416
What is that?

That is the Christmas Star.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.041
[majestic music playing]

26:43.125 --> 26:45.375
[Mrs. Claus]
It powers up the entire village.

26:46.041 --> 26:49.083
I devised a way to connect
the light from the Star of Bethlehem

26:49.166 --> 26:52.208
to the borealis,
and that's what creates the veil.

26:52.291 --> 26:56.750
And Santa is the only one who knows
how to get in and out of the veil safely.

26:56.833 --> 27:01.166
Wait. The light inside the star is
from the real Star of Bethlehem?

27:01.250 --> 27:02.833
Tiny sliver of it.

27:02.916 --> 27:05.791
Just as bright and powerful
as the day the elves gave it to me

27:05.875 --> 27:08.041
almost 1,700 years ago.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.583
-1,700 years ago?
-[Santa] Mm-hmm.

27:10.666 --> 27:12.041
You're that old?

27:12.125 --> 27:15.833
Mm-hmm. You see, time stands still
here in the North Pole, Jack.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.291
That's why you don't age.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.916
-[blasting]
-What was that?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.666
-[laughs]
-That's the cannons.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.875
-Cannons?
-Yeah, it's okay, Jack.

27:23.958 --> 27:24.791
[cannons blast]

27:24.875 --> 27:27.541
[Mrs. Claus] The veil keeps everyone
and everything

27:27.625 --> 27:30.208
from getting into the North Pole,
including snow,

27:30.291 --> 27:34.208
so the elves have to pipe it in
from the outside. Look.

27:34.291 --> 27:37.500
-[elves chattering]
-[majestic music continues playing]

27:38.625 --> 27:40.500
-[Santa chuckles]
-[Jack] Wow.

27:45.583 --> 27:47.666
It looks like we're in a giant snow globe.

27:47.750 --> 27:48.583
Yeah.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.333
[in Elvish]

27:56.333 --> 27:58.666
-[in English] What?
-Come on, Jack.

27:58.750 --> 28:00.750
[elves laughing and cheering]

28:15.750 --> 28:19.250
Ah, Nick, look at them.
They're having the time of their lives.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.875
-[chuckles] Yes, they are. And so are you.
-[chuckles, sighs]

28:24.666 --> 28:25.666
Real children.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.791
[inhales sharply] It's just been so long.

28:29.875 --> 28:30.875
[chuckles]

28:30.958 --> 28:34.666
-[sighs] I'll be sad to see them leave.
-[Santa] Mm.

28:35.333 --> 28:37.541
[clicks tongue]
Well, we can't send them home

28:37.625 --> 28:38.791
on an empty stomach.

28:39.666 --> 28:41.458
-Certainly not.
-That would be rude.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.708
-Oh, very unthoughtful.
-We can't have that.

28:43.791 --> 28:46.416
No. No. Well, then it's decided.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.791
They'll come for dinner,
and then you'll take them back.

28:48.875 --> 28:50.375
Exactly what I was thinking.

28:50.458 --> 28:53.416
And I have to prepare.
Oh, I have to prepare.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.541
-Jojo.
-[Jojo] Uh-huh?

28:54.625 --> 28:56.708
-I need corn for popping.
-[Jojo repeats]

28:56.791 --> 28:58.291
Uh, three French hens,

28:58.375 --> 29:01.666
a partridge, a pear, and figgy pudding!

29:01.750 --> 29:03.958
-[elf] Ooh, figgy pudding.
-[elves chatter]

29:04.041 --> 29:05.583
-[fire crackling]
-[elf] Ah.

29:05.666 --> 29:08.333
-[Santa] All right.
-[elf squeaks, grunts]

29:09.750 --> 29:11.166
[Jojo] Ah. Ooh.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.250
Wow!

29:12.333 --> 29:14.250
-This is dinner?
-Uh-huh.

29:14.333 --> 29:17.833
[Santa] Prepared by the North Pole's
executive chef, Mrs. Claus.

29:17.916 --> 29:20.291
Well, a little something
I whipped up last minute.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.041
-[both chuckle]
-Okay, let's sit down.

29:22.125 --> 29:26.583
-You're over here, Kate. [clears throat]
-[Jack] I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

29:26.666 --> 29:27.791
My dad's really strict

29:27.875 --> 29:31.208
about me eating my protein and vegetables
before I have dessert.

29:31.291 --> 29:34.250
Well, as he should be,
but this isn't dessert.

29:34.333 --> 29:35.250
It's not?

29:35.916 --> 29:39.333
No, everything on this table
is super healthy for you.

29:40.083 --> 29:41.750
How is that possible?

29:41.833 --> 29:44.041
Well, I've created some new recipes.

29:44.125 --> 29:46.583
Recipes that make all the food you hate

29:46.666 --> 29:49.125
look and taste like all the food you love.

29:49.208 --> 29:50.458
-[Santa chuckles]
-Wow.

29:51.708 --> 29:53.416
Would you like some broccoli?

29:53.500 --> 29:54.416
[Jack gasps]

29:54.500 --> 29:56.291
[clock chiming]

29:58.791 --> 29:59.833
[Jack exhales]

30:00.791 --> 30:03.750
This is the most delicious thing
I've ever tasted!

30:03.833 --> 30:05.500
-All right!
-[Santa laughs]

30:05.583 --> 30:08.083
Well, now, don't miss
the lima beans and carrots.

30:11.083 --> 30:12.166
Wow!

30:12.666 --> 30:13.541
So…

30:15.041 --> 30:16.708
[chewing] …I've been thinking…

30:18.291 --> 30:19.708
about how you got here.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.791
All this business
about coming through a wormhole.

30:24.208 --> 30:26.583
It's true.
It was just like on your sleigh.

30:26.666 --> 30:29.583
Only, instead of a sleigh,
it was a golf cart.

30:29.666 --> 30:30.500
[Santa] Hmm.

30:30.583 --> 30:31.625
-[Mrs. Claus] Nick?
-Hmm?

30:31.708 --> 30:35.708
I have a feeling this has something to do
with Kate being a True Believer.

30:35.791 --> 30:37.208
[Santa] Hmm.

30:37.708 --> 30:39.916
Yeah. What if it means
that I'm supposed to live here

30:40.000 --> 30:41.541
with you guys in the North Pole?

30:41.625 --> 30:44.958
[spits, coughs] Excuse me?

30:45.041 --> 30:48.250
Come on, Santa. I already speak Elvish,
I've been on the big ride,

30:48.333 --> 30:50.875
and I could bring a fresh perspective
to the whole operation.

30:51.375 --> 30:54.833
When did this turn into a job interview?
[chuckles]

30:54.916 --> 30:55.916
[Kate] Please, Santa.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.291
Anything would be better than going home
to my mom and her boyfriend.

30:59.375 --> 31:01.333
I'm sitting right here, you know.

31:01.416 --> 31:02.583
[Kate sighs]

31:02.666 --> 31:05.333
I'm sure your mother loves you very much.

31:05.416 --> 31:07.916
More than you can ever imagine.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.541
I don't know, Mrs. Claus.

31:09.625 --> 31:13.500
You should've seen how fast she ditched me
for those stupid Mayan ruins.

31:13.583 --> 31:14.916
[Jack] She's right about that.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.666
And besides, our parents
aren't even gonna get back to the resort

31:18.750 --> 31:20.125
until tomorrow afternoon.

31:20.208 --> 31:21.250
[Santa] Hmm.

31:22.208 --> 31:24.958
Come on, Santa, let us stay.
Even just for a little bit?

31:25.541 --> 31:27.333
Hmm. Um… [smacks lips]

31:27.916 --> 31:29.125
Mrs. Claus?

31:29.208 --> 31:34.041
[takes a deep breath] Well, it would be
so nice having children here…

31:35.125 --> 31:37.541
if only just for one night. [sighs]

31:37.625 --> 31:39.625
[gentle orchestral music playing]

31:41.708 --> 31:43.791
-Please, Santa. Let us stay.
-We'll be good. I promise.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.750
-Just for one night. Please?
-[Jack] Come on.

31:45.833 --> 31:49.041
Well, I don't…
I don't see the harm in it, but, uh…

31:49.958 --> 31:52.583
-Oh, why not? Absolutely.
-[Kate and Jack] Yes!

31:52.666 --> 31:54.416
-Thank you, Santa.
-[sighs]

31:54.500 --> 31:57.625
But then first thing in the morning,
it's right back to Cancun, huh?

31:57.708 --> 32:00.375
Mrs. Claus's Village
is the best place on earth!

32:00.458 --> 32:01.458
Oh! [laughs]

32:01.541 --> 32:04.250
[chuckles, grunts]

32:04.708 --> 32:07.166
[Mina grunting and straining]

32:07.250 --> 32:10.333
[Belsnickel] So, Mina,
this is what you get for spying on me.

32:11.250 --> 32:15.208
[sighs] Speck,
bring me the rest of my toys.

32:15.291 --> 32:17.041
[Speck straining]

32:19.416 --> 32:21.375
[grunts, panting]

32:26.916 --> 32:28.625
[Belsnickel] Ah. Okay.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.250
You know what to do.

32:30.333 --> 32:33.291
-[robot beeps]
-[Belsnickel chuckles softly]

32:35.333 --> 32:37.333
[robot whirring]

32:43.666 --> 32:48.375
In a few hours, this entire village
will be nothing but a distant memory.

32:49.041 --> 32:52.583
[menacing orchestral music plays]

32:52.666 --> 32:54.291
[Mrs. Claus] Good night, sweet Jack.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.291
-[kisses]
-Good night, Mrs. Claus.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.250
Sleep tight.

32:58.958 --> 33:00.083
Oh!

33:00.166 --> 33:02.750
Sweetheart, sleep tight. [kisses]

33:02.833 --> 33:04.333
[Kate] Good night, Mrs. Claus.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.041
The Christmas Chronicles?

33:12.166 --> 33:13.208
-Jack!
-[gasps]

33:14.291 --> 33:17.041
I wouldn't touch those if I were you.
They look pretty rare.

33:17.125 --> 33:20.750
-[Mrs. Claus] Yes, they are very rare.
-Oh, they're one of a kind, actually.

33:20.833 --> 33:24.500
[chuckles softly, sighs]
Would you like to hear a bedtime story?

33:24.583 --> 33:27.000
-Man, that would be awesome!
-That'd be amazing.

33:27.083 --> 33:28.958
-Oh, okay.
-[Santa chuckles]

33:29.041 --> 33:32.375
-[gentle orchestral music plays]
-Well, here. Come on, follow me.

33:35.250 --> 33:38.916
Well, have a cozy winter's nap, children.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.125
Good night, Santa.

33:40.708 --> 33:41.708
Sweet dreams.

33:41.791 --> 33:44.916
-Good night, Santa Claus.
-You know, you can just call him Santa.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.458
[all chuckle]

33:46.541 --> 33:49.958
[Mrs. Claus sighs]
All right, now. Here we go.

33:50.041 --> 33:51.375
[pages rustle]

33:51.458 --> 33:55.083
[Mrs. Claus] So, yeah. Okay.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.708
[sighs] Look closely, children.

34:00.541 --> 34:01.416
Very,

34:01.916 --> 34:03.083
very closely.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.875
-[wind blows]
-[Mrs. Claus] This is where it all began.

34:06.375 --> 34:09.416
-Back in 312 AD.
-[gentle flute music playing]

34:09.500 --> 34:14.000
[Mrs. Claus] Santa was living
in Asia Minor. Today, it's called Turkey.

34:14.083 --> 34:15.416
[coins jingling]

34:15.500 --> 34:17.458
[Mrs. Claus]
Santa was known as Saint Nicholas.

34:17.541 --> 34:18.750
[Santa chuckles]

34:18.833 --> 34:22.041
[Mrs. Claus] He was a bishop
who discovered the joy of giving.

34:22.125 --> 34:24.250
-[crickets chirping]
-[Santa grunts]

34:24.333 --> 34:26.375
[Mrs. Claus]
Became something of a local hero.

34:27.541 --> 34:32.791
And his legend spread far and wide,
eventually reaching the Forest Elves.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.333
Wait, you mean
there are different kinds of elves?

34:36.416 --> 34:41.000
Oh, of course. They're an ancient species
of very magical and wild creatures.

34:41.083 --> 34:44.166
For centuries, they were hunted
for their magical powers,

34:44.250 --> 34:48.125
and then they were captured by humans
to the brink of extinction.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.833
-[elves clamoring in Elvish]
-[hunters cackling]

34:51.833 --> 34:53.791
[in Elvish]

34:54.791 --> 34:56.750
[sighs, in English] That's awful.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.041
Oh, it was.

34:58.750 --> 35:01.083
[sighs] But in elf lore,

35:01.166 --> 35:02.500
there was a prophecy

35:02.583 --> 35:05.041
about a man
who would be king of the elves,

35:05.125 --> 35:07.791
who would, one day, lead them to safety.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.541
[wind whistling]

35:09.625 --> 35:13.833
[Mrs. Claus] Their leader, Hakan,
knew that Saint Nicholas was the only one

35:13.916 --> 35:16.708
who could channel
the Star of Bethlehem's power.

35:17.708 --> 35:19.208
From that day forward,

35:19.291 --> 35:22.125
they no longer referred to him
as Saint Nicholas.

35:22.625 --> 35:26.208
-They called him Santa Claus.
-[elves murmuring]

35:26.291 --> 35:29.208
[Mrs. Claus] And he led the elves
on a mystical journey

35:29.291 --> 35:33.666
to an unknown land,
where Christmas would truly endure.

35:34.291 --> 35:36.708
[Jack] That's here. That's the North Pole.

35:36.791 --> 35:38.666
[Mrs. Claus chuckles] Yes.

35:38.750 --> 35:39.875
[elves chatter]

35:40.875 --> 35:42.916
Weird. That one elf,

35:43.541 --> 35:45.250
he looks kinda familiar.

35:45.833 --> 35:46.708
Yeah.

35:46.791 --> 35:47.666
[Mrs. Claus] Hmm.

35:49.333 --> 35:50.208
Belsnickel.

35:50.958 --> 35:51.791
[softly] Here.

35:54.000 --> 35:54.875
[chimes jingle]

35:56.708 --> 35:58.666
[book whooshes]

35:58.750 --> 36:00.000
[both chuckle] Whoa!

36:00.083 --> 36:00.958
[softly] Okay.

36:02.416 --> 36:05.291
Now… [sighs]

36:05.375 --> 36:09.125
Belsnickel was a precocious
and brilliant elf

36:09.208 --> 36:11.750
who was very popular here in the village.

36:11.833 --> 36:14.458
I taught him the art
of magical potion-making,

36:14.541 --> 36:17.375
and Santa taught him the art of invention.

36:17.458 --> 36:18.916
-[speaking Elvish]
-[Belsnickel] Ooh.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.958
-[electricity pops]
-[Belsnickel groans]

36:21.041 --> 36:24.333
-[toy clicks]
-[chuckles, in English] Hey. Okay.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.833
-[piece dings]
-[Santa] Uh-huh.

36:26.916 --> 36:27.833
[toy whirring]

36:27.916 --> 36:29.166
-[Santa laughs]
-Wow.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.250
[Santa sighs]

36:30.333 --> 36:31.166
Oh.

36:31.250 --> 36:34.166
[Mrs. Claus]
We had so many good times together.

36:34.250 --> 36:38.958
Santa and I grew
to love him very, very much.

36:39.666 --> 36:43.166
But, by the time Belsnickel
became a teenager, everything changed.

36:43.250 --> 36:46.291
The spirit of Christmas
had grown around the world.

36:46.375 --> 36:48.500
Santa had less time for Belsnickel,

36:49.166 --> 36:53.583
so Belsnickel became resentful
of Santa, and more rebellious.

36:54.041 --> 36:57.541
Until, one day, he broke the Elves' Code.

36:58.125 --> 36:59.500
What's the Elves' Code?

37:00.166 --> 37:03.541
Ego, lying, viciousness,

37:03.625 --> 37:06.000
envy, and selfishness.

37:06.833 --> 37:10.041
And if an elf commits
every single one of those transgressions,

37:10.125 --> 37:12.000
they become cursed.

37:12.750 --> 37:16.458
[clicks tongue]
And Belsnickel, well, he broke all five.

37:16.541 --> 37:18.125
[wind whistles]

37:18.208 --> 37:20.625
[Mrs. Claus] He became a very naughty boy.

37:20.708 --> 37:23.833
-[elves chattering]
-[Fleck humming]

37:23.916 --> 37:25.250
[Belsnickel blows]

37:27.000 --> 37:29.916
-[chuckles]
-[Fleck grunts]

37:30.000 --> 37:31.208
[whoopee cushion blows]

37:31.291 --> 37:32.208
Ew!

37:32.291 --> 37:33.791
[in Elvish]

37:34.458 --> 37:38.125
-Blech!
-[all laughing]

37:38.208 --> 37:40.583
-[Belsnickel jeers]
-[Fleck whines]

37:40.666 --> 37:42.916
[Mrs. Claus, in English]
And he kept getting naughtier…

37:43.000 --> 37:44.083
[glass shatters]

37:45.666 --> 37:47.541
[Bjorn hums, laughs]

37:47.625 --> 37:48.791
[yelps]

37:50.125 --> 37:51.500
[grunts, gasps]

37:51.583 --> 37:53.666
[grunts, moans]

37:53.750 --> 37:55.000
…and naughtier.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.541
[in Elvish]

37:56.625 --> 37:58.458
-[both chuckle]
-[Jojo] Mm-hmm.

37:58.541 --> 38:00.833
-[in English] Enjoy.
-Very nice. Hmm.

38:03.208 --> 38:04.041
Oh.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.083
-[scoffs]
-[Belsnickel laughs]

38:11.000 --> 38:11.875
[Santa] Ah.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.833
-Belsnickel! What is this?
-[Belsnickel] Ah.

38:15.375 --> 38:20.000
I build all the best toys around here.
It's about time I get some of the credit.

38:21.750 --> 38:22.791
[Santa sighs]

38:22.875 --> 38:25.833
[Mrs. Claus]
And when he broke the final transgression,

38:25.916 --> 38:28.875
Belsnickel was stripped
of the joy of being an elf.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.375
-[paint sprays]
-Belsnickel!

38:30.458 --> 38:31.625
What are you doing?

38:31.708 --> 38:34.083
-[Belsnickel grunts]
-[Santa] Why would you do that?

38:34.166 --> 38:37.333
Because you care more
about children all over the world

38:37.416 --> 38:38.791
than you care about me.

38:39.791 --> 38:44.583
[Mrs. Claus] And with that, he transformed
into the thing he despised the most,

38:44.666 --> 38:45.625
a human.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.375
[Belsnickel groans] Ah!

38:47.458 --> 38:49.125
[panting]

38:50.291 --> 38:51.583
Ah! Oh!

38:51.666 --> 38:53.458
[gasps, groans]

38:53.541 --> 38:55.250
[continues grunting]

38:55.333 --> 38:57.958
[voice grows deeper] Oh, oh! Ah!

38:59.208 --> 39:00.833
[groans, breathing shakily]

39:01.500 --> 39:03.000
[panting]

39:03.083 --> 39:06.375
[Mrs. Claus]
Clouded by anger and humiliation…

39:06.458 --> 39:08.916
-No, no, no! Wait, wait!
-Belsnickel, come back!

39:09.000 --> 39:10.916
…Belsnickel ran away from the village…

39:12.333 --> 39:13.500
never to return.

39:14.208 --> 39:15.250
[Jack sighs]

39:16.500 --> 39:20.125
He was a naughty little elf…
but I miss him.

39:21.958 --> 39:22.791
Okay.

39:24.208 --> 39:26.041
That's about enough for tonight.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.416
We get up at the crack of dawn
around here.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.458
Good night, Mrs. Claus.

39:29.541 --> 39:32.166
-Good night, Mrs. Claus.
-Good night, children.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.250
[chimes ring]

39:57.833 --> 39:58.791

39:58.875 --> 40:00.083
[in English] It's time.

40:00.583 --> 40:02.791
[sighs] I can't wait to see
what's gonna happen

40:02.875 --> 40:04.875
when the elves get
a snootful of this stuff.

40:04.958 --> 40:07.458
-[Speck cackles]
-Ah, this is gonna be fun.

40:08.791 --> 40:12.041
Now, only one small scoop
into each cannon.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.416
[Speck] Mm-hmm.

44:54.500 --> 44:55.416
Missing something?

44:56.000 --> 44:59.500
You've played a lot of nasty tricks
in your time, Belsnickel,

44:59.583 --> 45:01.708
but sending Jola into the stables?

45:01.791 --> 45:02.666
[Belsnickel] Big deal.

45:02.750 --> 45:05.125
So, he scared the reindeer,
and they ran off into the forest.

45:05.208 --> 45:06.666
He attacked Dasher!

45:08.541 --> 45:11.458

My apologies for any inconvenience.

back in Cancun.

45:40.083 --> 45:41.833
-[Jack] Yeah.
-Yep.

45:41.916 --> 45:44.083
And I gotta thank you, Kate,
because, without you,

45:44.166 --> 45:46.541
I never could have got
back inside Santa's Village.

this little family reunion's been sweet,

45:57.416 --> 45:59.625

back at the South Pole.

Ooh, it's gonna be the shiz.
I am starting a new village.

I can see it now. "Belsnickel's Village."

46:14.875 --> 46:17.958
-There's gonna be another village?
-[Belsnickel] You bet there is.

46:18.041 --> 46:20.083
And I'm gonna round up
my own band of elves,

46:20.166 --> 46:22.833
and I'm gonna invent my own stuff,
really cool stuff,

46:22.916 --> 46:25.958
that will make everybody forget
that the North Pole

46:26.041 --> 46:28.458

46:32.333 --> 46:33.291
Whatever.

46:33.875 --> 46:38.375
I am taking the star to the South Pole
so I can stop aging and buy some time

46:38.458 --> 46:41.541
to figure out a way
to break this awful curse.

46:41.625 --> 46:43.875

46:47.500 --> 46:50.208
And I am tired of being a human!

46:50.708 --> 46:54.500
Belsnickel, there's only one way
to break the curse,

46:54.583 --> 46:57.375
and that's for you
to come back home to the village

46:57.458 --> 46:59.000
and embrace your family.

46:59.583 --> 47:01.916

feel love and happiness.

47:43.458 --> 47:45.375

47:45.458 --> 47:46.916
Change, ha!

You couldn't handle
any of the little changes

47:49.000 --> 47:51.458

so you ran away.

47:51.541 --> 47:55.625

Okay.

54:46.375 --> 54:47.291
[in Elvish]

54:48.250 --> 54:51.291
[in English]
I just baked a whole batch of cookies!

54:51.375 --> 54:52.958
-[Hugg] Cookies?
-Who's hungry?

54:53.041 --> 54:55.500

-[elves laughing]
-[Hugg chattering] Cookie!

55:01.583 --> 55:03.916
[in English] That will distract them
for about 30 seconds.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.125
-Got it.
-Now… there.

55:07.708 --> 55:10.041

[exhales] Now's your chance, Jack.

55:14.791 --> 55:17.291
[takes a deep breath]
It's pretty cold out there.

55:17.791 --> 55:19.166
What if I get frostbite?

55:19.250 --> 55:22.000
Oh, don't worry about frostbite.

55:22.083 --> 55:24.625
I'm an expert
at reattaching fingers and toes.

55:25.916 --> 55:27.708

-Now, hurry.

55:29.875 --> 55:30.708
Jack!

55:32.375 --> 55:35.166
-[gentle orchestral music playing]
-Be my hero.

55:36.208 --> 55:39.583
My mom used to say
the same thing to me. [sighs]

55:48.500 --> 55:50.833
Okay. It's hero time.

55:56.541 --> 56:00.166
[dramatic orchestral music plays]

56:07.541 --> 56:10.458
This is not what I expected Turkey
to look like at all.

56:10.541 --> 56:12.875
Ah, you're on hallowed ground here, Kate.

56:14.208 --> 56:17.625
You're about to witness something
that no one else on earth

56:17.708 --> 56:19.291
has ever seen before.

56:38.208 --> 56:40.000
-Uh, Santa?
-What?

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
You've been shot.

56:42.083 --> 56:42.916
What?

56:45.166 --> 56:46.166
[Santa] Hmm.

56:47.375 --> 56:49.125
Well, don't you feel anything?

56:49.208 --> 56:52.500
Nah, riding around in the sleigh
is like a shot of novocaine

56:52.583 --> 56:55.166
in the old butt cheek sometimes.

-[elves murmuring and gasping]
-[Santa] Hmm.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.666
[in English] Why don't they recognize you?

58:07.750 --> 58:09.958
Oh, they're just kids.

58:10.041 --> 58:10.958
Look at 'em.

58:11.541 --> 58:14.916
Can't be more than-- What?
Two, three hundred years old?

58:15.625 --> 58:17.875
They've never seen me. [chuckles]

58:17.958 --> 58:19.625
I haven't been back here in,

58:19.708 --> 58:22.500
oh, I don't know,
maybe 500 years. [chuckles]

58:22.583 --> 58:26.458
Five hundred and twenty-two,
to be exact, Nicholas.

58:27.625 --> 58:29.083
Hakan. [clicks tongue]

58:29.708 --> 58:32.416
You look well and wise.

58:32.500 --> 58:34.916
You as well, Nicholas.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.083
Who's your friend?

58:36.833 --> 58:38.541
[in Elvish]

58:38.625 --> 58:42.000
[in English] Hmm.
Your Elvish is impressive.

58:42.583 --> 58:43.791
So is your English.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.125
Thank you.

58:46.041 --> 58:48.958
So, what brings you both here?

58:49.833 --> 58:53.666
-Belsnickel.
-Oh. What's he done now?

58:54.416 --> 58:56.375
Destroyed the Christmas Star.

58:56.958 --> 58:58.708
[elves gasp]

58:58.791 --> 59:00.041
[murmuring]

59:01.791 --> 59:05.208
Well, we can build a new container.

59:05.958 --> 59:07.500
But only you, Nicholas,

59:07.583 --> 59:11.916
can harness the power
of the Star of Bethlehem.

59:12.416 --> 59:16.250
And as you know,
the ritual is very dangerous.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.625
[Santa] We have no other choice.

59:18.708 --> 59:20.458
We must move quickly.

[in English] That is really high.

1:00:14.208 --> 1:00:17.333
Okay. Which one
did she say gives you courage,

1:00:17.416 --> 1:00:18.791
and which one explodes?

1:00:19.500 --> 1:00:21.833
I'm gonna go with the gingerbread man.

1:00:23.541 --> 1:00:25.875
No, no, it's the snowman…

1:00:26.458 --> 1:00:27.625
I think.

1:00:27.708 --> 1:00:29.375
I hope I don't blow up.

Thank you, Santa Claus.

Now, hurry back to the North Pole.

Jackal and coyote hybrid.
My creation. Pretty cool, huh?

1:04:34.041 --> 1:04:35.958
They're a long way from cool.

1:04:36.750 --> 1:04:39.833
But you are clever, Belsnickel.
I'll give you that.

1:04:39.916 --> 1:04:43.333
Just not clever enough
to beat me. [laughs]

Back in time?

1:06:30.250 --> 1:06:31.083
Why not?

Well, during the holidays,

Christmas Spirit in the world.

Well, what happens
if Christmas Spirit gets down to zero?

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:48.958
The reindeer won't be able to fly at all.
Now, look at them. They're exhausted.

1:06:49.041 --> 1:06:52.458
All right. Hold on tight.
Okay, I'm gonna have to bring her down.

1:06:52.958 --> 1:06:55.041

-What?

1:07:36.166 --> 1:07:38.416
We just opened a tear
in the fabric of time.

1:07:38.916 --> 1:07:41.958
-Those wormholes won't stay open for long.
-How much time do we have?

1:07:42.041 --> 1:07:44.750
Uh, 11, 12 minutes, at the most.

1:07:44.833 --> 1:07:47.625
Which means
if we don't get Christmas Spirit up soon…

1:07:48.333 --> 1:07:49.791

-Ah, some kind of time twister.

It's just, it's only been
a couple years since my… my dad…

1:15:39.125 --> 1:15:44.291
And, well, if my mom marries Bob,
then it means…

1:15:46.250 --> 1:15:47.625

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.166

you know?

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:58.833
And… I just really wanted
to say goodbye to him.

1:26:47.250 --> 1:26:50.166
-Oh, Dasher! You're all better now.
-[Dasher grunts]

1:26:50.250 --> 1:26:52.958
Thank you for saving my life. Oh! [kisses]

1:26:54.708 --> 1:26:56.125
Bad move, Yule Cat.

[sighs] Sayonara, Jola!

1:27:15.916 --> 1:27:16.916
Dasher!

1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:18.916
[chuckling] Oh, girl!

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:20.541
[kisses] Oh!

1:27:20.625 --> 1:27:22.375
-[Mrs. Claus] Welcome back.
-[control beeps]

1:27:22.458 --> 1:27:24.875
[Santa] Welcome back, girl.
You look great!

1:27:24.958 --> 1:27:28.291
-[Mrs. Claus] She does, doesn't she?
-[Santa] That was a perfect antler smash!

1:27:28.375 --> 1:27:30.583
-[Santa and Mrs. Claus laugh]
-[Santa] Oh!

1:27:30.666 --> 1:27:32.375
I knew you'd work a miracle.

1:27:32.458 --> 1:27:34.125
-Thank you.
-[Santa sighs]

1:27:34.208 --> 1:27:36.958
-Welcome back, girl.
-[Belsnickel gasps]

1:27:37.041 --> 1:27:38.375
[Santa] Oh!

[suspenseful orchestral music playing]

1:28:27.250 --> 1:28:28.333
Whoa!

1:28:29.708 --> 1:28:31.541
[sighs] Oh. Huh?

1:28:32.541 --> 1:28:33.583
Uh… [grunts]

1:28:34.291 --> 1:28:35.375
[screams, echoes]

1:28:36.666 --> 1:28:38.625
[Kate continues screaming]

1:28:38.708 --> 1:28:39.541
Oh, no!

1:28:44.458 --> 1:28:45.416
[sighs]

1:28:46.333 --> 1:28:47.833
Just one shot left.

1:28:48.958 --> 1:28:52.250
-[crossbow cocks]
-You can do this. [sighs]

1:28:52.333 --> 1:28:54.166

-Ah!
-[elves laugh]

1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:22.416
[sighs, grunts]

1:29:23.208 --> 1:29:24.375
Thanks, Jack!

1:29:24.458 --> 1:29:25.625
No problem, Kate!

1:29:30.541 --> 1:29:31.791
[cannons blasting]

[Kate panting]

1:31:03.291 --> 1:31:04.750
-[in English] We did it!
-[Jack] Yeah!

1:31:04.833 --> 1:31:08.875
-[laughs] Attagirl, Kate!
-Great job with the cannons, Jack.

1:31:08.958 --> 1:31:09.791
[sighs]

1:31:10.458 --> 1:31:13.875
[panting] You may have won the battle,
but you'll never win the war.

1:31:13.958 --> 1:31:14.791
[Santa sighs]

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:16.875
I'll find another way
to get back in the village.

1:31:16.958 --> 1:31:18.458
I'll come back one day,

1:31:18.958 --> 1:31:21.416
and you'll all be in
for the fight of your life.

1:31:21.500 --> 1:31:24.125
I don't really think
you mean that, Belsnickel.

1:31:24.208 --> 1:31:26.625
But if you do, I'll be ready. [chuckles]

1:31:26.708 --> 1:31:29.083
But, uh, until then…

1:31:30.041 --> 1:31:32.083
there's something I want you to have.

1:31:32.166 --> 1:31:34.583
-A little gift.
-[Belsnickel] Let me guess.

1:31:35.166 --> 1:31:38.291
Coal? You're so predictable.

1:31:39.916 --> 1:31:41.875
[gentle orchestral music playing]

1:31:49.333 --> 1:31:50.291
The first toy…

1:31:51.958 --> 1:31:53.125
that we built together.

1:31:53.625 --> 1:31:55.208
[Santa chuckles softly] Mm-hmm.

1:31:57.125 --> 1:31:58.000
You kept it?

1:31:58.541 --> 1:32:01.125
[chuckling] Well, I kept working on it.

1:32:02.791 --> 1:32:05.708
Helped remind me
of what an amazing elf you are.

1:32:07.958 --> 1:32:09.375
You mean, the elf I was.

1:32:10.250 --> 1:32:13.416
He's still in there.
You just need to believe it.

1:32:15.875 --> 1:32:17.625
[Belsnickel breathing shakily]

1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:22.583
[chimes jingle]

1:32:23.208 --> 1:32:25.041
[toy whirring]

1:32:25.750 --> 1:32:27.833
[Belsnickel panting softly]

1:32:31.458 --> 1:32:33.041
[letters chiming]

1:32:45.541 --> 1:32:49.166
[sighs, voice breaking]
We had some good times.

1:32:52.333 --> 1:32:54.166
But I'll never be that elf again.

1:32:54.250 --> 1:32:55.583
Of course you will.

1:32:56.083 --> 1:32:58.416
[scoffs] Easy for you to say.

1:33:00.375 --> 1:33:02.375
You don't know what this feels like.

1:33:02.458 --> 1:33:05.000
Belsnickel, you don't need to be an elf

1:33:05.083 --> 1:33:09.291
to realize that running away
doesn't solve all your problems.

1:33:10.541 --> 1:33:12.708
And sometimes,

1:33:12.791 --> 1:33:15.625
we need to listen
to the ones that we love the most.

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:19.708
Because at the end of the day,

1:33:20.416 --> 1:33:23.000
your family are the only ones
in the whole world

1:33:23.083 --> 1:33:24.500
who really understand you.

1:33:25.833 --> 1:33:29.916
They're the only ones that will always
be there for you, no matter what.

1:33:32.208 --> 1:33:33.666
Someone really cool once told me

1:33:33.750 --> 1:33:37.583
that Christmas isn't about where you are
but who you're with.

1:33:42.750 --> 1:33:44.166
We love you, Belsnickel.

1:33:44.666 --> 1:33:45.958
Always have, Bels.

1:33:50.166 --> 1:33:53.041
[sighs] I've always loved you guys.

1:33:55.833 --> 1:33:57.833
-[bells tolling]
-[Belsnickel gasps]

1:34:02.041 --> 1:34:03.625
[breathing heavily]

1:34:07.791 --> 1:34:09.958
-[gasps] Oh!
-[Santa exhales]

1:34:10.041 --> 1:34:12.083
[Belsnickel takes a deep breath]

1:34:12.916 --> 1:34:14.625
[Kate and Jack gasp]

1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.041
[Mrs. Claus sighs, gasps]

1:34:18.125 --> 1:34:19.625
[whines, gasps]

1:34:19.708 --> 1:34:20.958
[elves exclaim]

1:34:21.041 --> 1:34:22.750
[Santa and Mrs. Claus cheer]

1:34:25.083 --> 1:34:27.541
I officially declare…

1:34:27.625 --> 1:34:30.916
order has been restored to the North Pole!

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:32.208
[all cheering]

1:34:32.291 --> 1:34:34.291
[elves chattering and laughing]

1:34:40.958 --> 1:34:44.041
Now, Dasher,
are you sure you're ready for this trip?

1:34:44.125 --> 1:34:45.333
[Dasher grunts]

1:34:47.208 --> 1:34:48.166
If you say so.

1:34:50.208 --> 1:34:52.875
All right. Last sleigh to Cancun.

1:34:52.958 --> 1:34:55.375
-All aboard.
-[Jack gasps] Oh, my God.

1:34:55.458 --> 1:34:58.750
This is probably gonna be
my first and only trip in the sleigh.

1:34:58.833 --> 1:35:01.958
-Can I sit up front, Santa?
-Well, you can't drive from the back.

1:35:02.041 --> 1:35:03.458
-What?
-[laughs] Yeah.

1:35:03.541 --> 1:35:06.750
Now, this puppy's got some serious jump.
You think you can handle it?

1:35:06.833 --> 1:35:09.708
-Well, yeah!
-All right. Jump in and get the reins.

1:35:10.208 --> 1:35:11.750
There you go. [grunts]

1:35:12.833 --> 1:35:15.000
-Hey, Santa?
-[Santa exhales]

1:35:16.208 --> 1:35:18.208
I just wanted to say thank you.

1:35:19.333 --> 1:35:20.208
For what?

1:35:21.041 --> 1:35:22.916
For letting me say goodbye to my dad.

1:35:23.583 --> 1:35:27.250
Now, Kate, that was purely coincidental.

1:35:27.750 --> 1:35:29.666
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

1:35:30.875 --> 1:35:32.708
Jump in. [chuckles]

1:35:32.791 --> 1:35:34.416
Children! Children!

1:35:35.333 --> 1:35:38.958
[panting] In case
you get a little peckish on the ride.

1:35:39.458 --> 1:35:40.458
What's in these?

1:35:40.541 --> 1:35:44.666
Um, eggs, butter, flour, sugar.

1:35:44.750 --> 1:35:46.625
No. What kinda magic is in them?

1:35:47.125 --> 1:35:50.791
I mean, when I ate one in the forest,
I lost all my fears.

1:35:50.875 --> 1:35:53.208
The snowman cookie made me feel stronger.

1:35:54.958 --> 1:35:59.083
Well, only the gingerbread man
had magic ingredients.

1:35:59.791 --> 1:36:01.375
The snowman didn't have any.

1:36:03.708 --> 1:36:04.833
But wait.

1:36:06.125 --> 1:36:07.666
So, that means…

1:36:08.375 --> 1:36:11.166
The hero was always inside you.

1:36:12.291 --> 1:36:16.416
[sighs] I'll never forget you, Mrs. Claus.

1:36:17.916 --> 1:36:23.458
Oh… you will from time to time,
and that's as it should be.

1:36:23.958 --> 1:36:25.250
[Jack sighs]

1:36:27.166 --> 1:36:29.916
[sighs] Have a great journey.

1:36:30.500 --> 1:36:33.958
-[both] Merry Christmas, Mrs. Claus.
-Merry Christmas.

1:36:34.041 --> 1:36:36.250
-[grunts] Hey, guys.
-[Kate] Yeah?

1:36:36.333 --> 1:36:37.416
One last thing.

1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:41.083
-[Jack] What's that?
-Stay away from strangers in golf carts.

1:36:41.166 --> 1:36:43.291
-[all laugh]
-Will do.

1:36:43.875 --> 1:36:45.125
[in Elvish]

1:36:45.208 --> 1:36:46.833
-[doors open]
-[in English] Nick.

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:51.041
Hurry back.

1:36:51.625 --> 1:36:52.583
[blows kiss]

1:36:54.541 --> 1:36:56.666
-[chuckles softly]
-Hit it, Jack!

1:36:56.750 --> 1:37:01.166
Here goes. On, Dasher! On, Dancer!
On, Prancer! On, Vixen!

1:37:01.250 --> 1:37:02.875
-[reins crack]
-Goodbye, children!

1:37:02.958 --> 1:37:04.958
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

1:37:09.666 --> 1:37:12.000
[Santa] All right. Now pull 'em. Come on!

1:37:12.083 --> 1:37:15.541
That's it. That's it.
Now, pull 'em back! Pull 'em!

1:37:15.625 --> 1:37:17.333
-[Jack shouting in Elvish]
-Harder!

1:37:17.416 --> 1:37:21.458
-[shouts in Elvish]
-[laughing] Not bad. Not bad at all, Jack!

1:37:22.041 --> 1:37:23.750
All right, kids. We're here.

1:37:24.541 --> 1:37:25.458
Ready to jump?

1:37:25.541 --> 1:37:26.458
Jump?

1:37:28.666 --> 1:37:30.458
All the way down there?

1:37:30.541 --> 1:37:33.250
-[Santa] Mm-hmm.
-Trust me, Jack. You'll be fine.

1:37:33.333 --> 1:37:36.250
I don't know, Kate.
I fought a village of crazy elves,

1:37:36.333 --> 1:37:38.750
but this seems kinda dangerous,
if you ask me.

1:37:38.833 --> 1:37:41.208
You'll be okay. I promise.

1:37:41.916 --> 1:37:43.958
[sighs] Hey, Santa.

1:37:44.041 --> 1:37:45.041
Yeah?

1:37:45.125 --> 1:37:46.916
Will we ever see you again?

1:37:48.125 --> 1:37:49.583
Not if he can help it.

1:37:52.666 --> 1:37:53.916
We did it again.

1:37:55.333 --> 1:37:56.500
Yes, we did.

1:37:57.833 --> 1:37:58.791
Uh…

1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:02.000
Just one thing, Katie Cat.

1:38:03.291 --> 1:38:05.666
I know, Santa. I'll be good.

1:38:10.791 --> 1:38:11.875
[chimes jingle]

1:38:11.958 --> 1:38:12.958
[Kate] Whoo-hoo!

1:38:13.041 --> 1:38:14.750
[laughs]

1:38:14.833 --> 1:38:17.041
[soaring orchestral music playing]

1:38:26.333 --> 1:38:28.291
-On, Dasher!
-[Dasher grunts]

1:38:30.208 --> 1:38:32.333
[shouting] Merry Christmas, Teddy!

1:38:32.416 --> 1:38:33.833
You've gotta be kidding me.

1:38:34.333 --> 1:38:37.000
[wormhole whooshes]

1:38:37.083 --> 1:38:38.083
[chuckles softly]

1:38:46.416 --> 1:38:48.625
Looks like you guys had a visit
from our old friend.

1:38:48.708 --> 1:38:50.416
-[Kate chuckles]
-[chimes jingle]

1:38:51.208 --> 1:38:52.458
Was it as good as last time?

1:38:53.291 --> 1:38:54.916
Well, let me put it this way.

1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:56.250
I met Mrs. Claus,

1:38:56.333 --> 1:38:59.666

with Dad when he was 13.

-Yes way.

1:39:03.708 --> 1:39:06.875
Yeah, well, I climbed a glacier
and fought off a Yule cat,

1:39:06.958 --> 1:39:09.875
so I'm kind of a big deal
at the North Pole now.

1:39:09.958 --> 1:39:11.250
-Is that right?
-[Jack] Yeah.

1:39:11.333 --> 1:39:13.916
Me and Mrs. Claus are like this.

Wow. You guys gotta tell me everything,

1:39:16.666 --> 1:39:20.000
but Bob and Mom are actually
waiting for us, so we gotta go.

you were heading to Kids Club.

How'd you get
from there onto Santa's sleigh?

1:39:26.166 --> 1:39:28.541
You know, that was a life-changing trip.

-Come on! What?

-I'm so happy to see you, honey!
-[Bob] That's my main man!

-Ah, I missed you so much!
-Yeah!

that me and you can continue to bond.

You know, guys, I was thinking,
maybe tonight…

1:40:20.500 --> 1:40:22.458
maybe we should have a caroling party.

-Seriously?

1:40:24.666 --> 1:40:25.500
