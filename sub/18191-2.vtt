00:00.067 --> 00:01.435
PREVIOUSLY ON
"CHASING LIFE"...

00:01.469 --> 00:04.171
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.
I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY BIG NEWS.

00:04.205 --> 00:05.605
I GOT PROMOTED.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.775
I'M GIVING YOU AN ASSIGNMENT.
SO YOU UP FOR IT?

00:09.009 --> 00:10.310
April:
I MEANT MY OTHER NEWS.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.378
( exhales )

00:13.279 --> 00:15.048
George:
AFTER YOU FAINTED TODAY,

00:15.082 --> 00:16.516
I RAN SOME TESTS
ON YOUR BLOOD.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.353
YOU HAVE CANCER.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.489
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
I MIGHT BE...

00:21.521 --> 00:23.457
SEEING YOU SOMETIME SOON.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.059
Dominic:
IF YOU FEEL LIKE
GETTING AWAY LATER,

00:25.091 --> 00:26.393
I'M COVERING A SHOW
AT THE HANGOVER AT 9:00.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.463
April:
IF YOU'RE STILL SEEING SEAN,

00:30.498 --> 00:31.765
I'M TELLING YOU
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.634
IT'S NOT WORTH SCREWING
THIS FAMILY UP AGAIN.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.569
TAKE CARE OF
MY MAN TY, ALL RIGHT?

00:35.603 --> 00:37.137
WAIT, SEAN.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.773
BREN, WHERE ARE YOU?
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:38.805 --> 00:40.473
( crying )
NO.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.243
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY...

00:42.276 --> 00:45.579
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WAIT A WHILE.

00:45.612 --> 00:46.814
I'M NOT READY YET.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.816
THOSE ARE REALLY PRETTY.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.784
THANKS.
THEY'RE FOR MY DAD.

01:11.337 --> 01:14.207
I DROPPED MY EARRING.
SORRY.

01:20.713 --> 01:22.716
SO YOU SAID THAT--

01:22.750 --> 01:24.284
THAT'S YOUR DAD?

01:24.317 --> 01:25.486
YEAH.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.254
TODAY WOULD HAVE
BEEN HIS BIRTHDAY.

01:28.289 --> 01:31.625
THOMAS CARVER.
LIKE THE-- THE NOVELIST?

01:34.328 --> 01:37.698
- HE'S LIKE MY FAVORITE AUTHOR.
- MINE TOO.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.167
IT'S SUCH A TRAGEDY
WHAT HAPPENED.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.206
SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN,
LIKE,

01:46.240 --> 01:48.241
REALLY COOL
GROWING UP WITH HIM.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.777
WHO ARE YOU VISITING?

01:50.811 --> 01:53.614
UM, MY GRANDMA.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.319
I MEAN, WE-- I--
WE CALLED HER GRANDMA,

01:58.352 --> 01:59.887
BUT SHE WAS REALLY
MY GREAT...

02:00.120 --> 02:01.555
GREAT GREAT--

02:01.588 --> 02:03.290

I HAVE TO--

03:11.692 --> 03:12.926
I SLEPT WITH MIKE
LAST NIGHT.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.728
- WHAT?
- I KNOW.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.829
I KNOW.
I NEVER EVEN LIKED HIM
WHEN I WAS DATING HIM,

03:16.864 --> 03:18.865
AND THEN HE CHEATED ON ME
WITH THAT CHICK HE MET
AT THE CAR SHOW.

03:18.899 --> 03:21.200
- BUT JUST LISTEN--
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.802
NO! NO.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.573
SEE, THIS IS THE GENIUS PART.
HE THOUGHT I WANTED TO GET
BACK TOGETHER,

03:25.605 --> 03:27.274
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO TAKE THE POWER BACK.

03:27.307 --> 03:30.276
SO I USED HIM THIS TIME.
IT WAS AWESOME.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.879
BECAUSE, LET'S BE HONEST,
THERE'S NO SEX LIKE EX SEX.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.348
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.983
WELL, I DIDN'T BEFORE THIS.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.985
USUALLY I JUST MOVE
TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY
AFTER A BREAKUP.

03:39.218 --> 03:41.288
OKAY, YOUR TURN.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.793
I HAVE LEUKEMIA.

03:46.826 --> 03:49.329
HILARIOUS.
SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S UP?

03:49.362 --> 03:52.365
NO, SERIOUSLY,
I HAVE LEUKEMIA.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.901
I FOUND OUT
TWO DAYS AGO.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.902
YOU'RE THE ONLY
PERSON WHO KNOWS.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.438
AND AS IF GETTING CANCER
ISN'T BAD ENOUGH,

03:58.472 --> 04:00.373
NOW I'M BACK IN CONTACT
WITH THE GUY

04:00.407 --> 04:02.710
WHO BASICALLY
KILLED MY DAD.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.346
BECAUSE IT'S GEORGE,
I'M NOT SURE HOW
TO TELL MY FAMILY,

04:05.378 --> 04:08.382
OR EVEN IF I SHOULD.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW MY MOM.
SHE'S FINALLY DATING AGAIN

04:08.414 --> 04:10.985
AND IF I THROW THIS AT HER NOW
SHE'LL JUST FALL APART.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.819
OH, I CAN'T TELL
ANYONE AT WORK.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.254
LAWRENCE FINALLY GAVE ME
A HUGE ASSIGNMENT.

04:15.288 --> 04:16.723
AND HE'LL JUST--
HE'LL REPLACE ME

04:16.757 --> 04:18.725
WITH SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T HAVE LEUKEMIA.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.526
DOMINIC AND I
JUST STARTED DATING.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.029
WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?
"HAPPY SECOND DATE--
I HAVE CANCER"?

04:23.262 --> 04:25.966
I MEAN, BETH, LITERALLY
THE ONLY PERSON IN MY LIFE

04:26.000 --> 04:27.701
WHO CAN HANDLE THIS IS YOU.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.872
OH, DON'T CRY.
NO.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.976
( crying )
DUDE, THIS IS REALLY SAD.

04:37.011 --> 04:38.879
YOU HAVE CANCER?

04:38.911 --> 04:40.314
OH MY GOD.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.715
OH MY GOD.
YOU CAN'T DIE.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.483
- PLEASE, YOU CAN'T--
- SHH.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.653
- HEY, ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?
- YEAH.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.321
SHE JUST, UM...

04:47.353 --> 04:48.855
MISSES AUSTRALIA.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.723
OKAY.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.302
HEY, SWEETIE.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MORNING?

05:02.336 --> 05:04.338
WITH BETH.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.072
AND BEFORE THAT I WENT
TO SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO DAD.

05:06.305 --> 05:10.711
NOW YOUR DAD WOULD BE
SO PROUD TO SEE BOTH OF YOU,

05:10.744 --> 05:13.713
MAKING YOUR MARK
AS A REPORTER

05:13.747 --> 05:15.882
AND BRENNA'S REALLY
STARTING TO FLOURISH.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.985
ARE YOU GUYS TALKING TO ME?

05:19.019 --> 05:22.055
I WAS JUST SAYING
I ADMIRE YOU, HONEY.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.792
WHAT'S WRONG, BREN?
DIDN'T SLEEP WELL?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.860
MY HEAD IS EXPLODING.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.495
( dishes clatter loudly )

05:28.528 --> 05:30.663
MOM, COULD YOU NOT,
LIKE, SLAM THAT?

05:30.697 --> 05:32.932
( cellphone vibrates )

05:32.966 --> 05:34.067
WHO'S THAT?

05:34.100 --> 05:36.870
BEN...
( chuckles )

05:36.903 --> 05:37.904
...TEXTED ME.

05:40.606 --> 05:43.409
- THAT'S REALLY SWEET.
- WHAT'S REALLY SWEET?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.978
BEN SENT ME
A MESSAGE.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.081
WHY DOESN'T HE USE
CAPITAL LETTERS?

05:47.113 --> 05:50.651
- THAT'S HOW PEOPLE TEXT.
- NO, THAT'S HOW PEOPLE
WRITE RANSOM NOTES.

05:50.683 --> 05:54.353
ALL RIGHT, MOM.
LET'S GET YOU TO
YOUR BRIDGE GAME.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.122
ALL SET WITH
MY CINNAMON ROLLS,

05:56.355 --> 05:57.591
FRESH OUT OF THE OVEN.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.093
- MM.
- BYE.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.028
- BYE, GIRLS.
- BYE.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.129
( door closes )

06:02.362 --> 06:03.497
I HAVE AN EMERGENCY.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.831
I CAN'T FIND MY PHONE.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.000
I HAVE TO GO
BACK TO THE HOUSE
WHERE THE PARTY WAS

06:07.033 --> 06:08.601
AND FIND IT.
CAN YOU DRIVE ME?

06:08.634 --> 06:10.103
I CAN'T.
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.872
WELL, DRIVE ME ON THE WAY.
I'LL TAKE THE "T" HOME
FROM DOWNTOWN.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.041
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
ON THE WAY.

06:15.074 --> 06:18.612
COME ON, APRIL, I KNOW
I OWE YOU FOR SAVING
MY ASS LAST NIGHT,

06:18.644 --> 06:21.115
BUT PLEASE JUST DO
THIS ONE THING FOR ME.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.149
WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT ANYWAY?

06:23.382 --> 06:25.418
NOTHING.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.887
BRENNA, COME ON,
YOU CAN TELL ME.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.156
TELL ME WHY YOU CAN'T
TAKE ME TO GET MY PHONE.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.060
SERIOUSLY, THAT PHONE HAS
LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE ON IT.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.062
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST
TAKE HALF AN HOUR?

06:36.096 --> 06:38.432
NO! I HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE.

06:38.465 --> 06:42.069
I DON'T GET TO JUST SIT AROUND
ON SATURDAYS AND BE HUNG-OVER.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.605

SO, LEUKEMIA OCCURS

07:24.577 --> 07:27.047
WHEN THE BONE MARROW
STARTS PRODUCING

07:27.079 --> 07:28.915
ABNORMAL WHITE BLOOD CELLS.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.853
AND-- AND-- WELL, HERE.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.058
THESE JELLY BEANS
REPRESENT

07:39.091 --> 07:42.495
THREE TYPES OF BLOOD CELLS
THAT YOUR BONE MARROW
PRODUCES EVERY DAY.

07:42.528 --> 07:45.132
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE VAST
MAJORITY OF THEM ARE RED.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.100
THE OTHERS ARE PLATELETS
AND WHITE BLOOD CELLS.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.701
YOU WITH ME, APRIL?

07:50.002 --> 07:52.840
- SORRY. YES, BLOOD CELLS.
- OKAY, GREAT.

07:52.872 --> 07:57.076
THE FUNCTION OF THE PLATELETS,
FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE TO HELP
THE BLOOD TO CLOT.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.178
AND THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS
FIGHT INFECTION.

07:59.213 --> 08:02.983
BUT WITH LEUKEMIA, UM...

08:03.016 --> 08:05.185
YOUR BONE MARROW

08:05.218 --> 08:08.855
STARTS OVERPRODUCING
IMMATURE WHITE BLOOD CELLS.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.990
AND IT'S THESE
DEFECTIVE CELLS

08:11.024 --> 08:12.992
WHICH CAN'T FIGHT
THE INFECTION BECAUSE

08:13.026 --> 08:15.829
THEY'RE BEING PRODUCED
BY THE CANCER.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.997
SO...

08:18.031 --> 08:21.168
WE SHOULD DO A BONE-MARROW
BIOPSY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

08:21.201 --> 08:25.137
WE'LL BE ABLE TO FORMULATE
YOUR TREATMENT PLAN
FOR CHEMOTHERAPY.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.875
- CAN I COME IN AFTER WORK?
- WELL, ACTUALLY,

08:27.908 --> 08:30.543
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE
ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL,

08:30.576 --> 08:33.046
WHERE YOU'LL RECEIVE
CHEMO FOR SEVERAL DAYS.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.048
AND AFTER WHICH
THERE'LL BE TRANSFUSIONS.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.284
AS WELL AS YOU'LL BE
UNDER SOME OBSERVATION,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.653
JUST IN CASE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

08:40.687 --> 08:44.957
DO I REALLY NEED TO START
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS RIGHT NOW?

08:44.991 --> 08:47.059
I MEAN, I FEEL FINE.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.562
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS SICK THREE DAYS AGO.

08:49.596 --> 08:51.163
WHAT IF I HADN'T GONE
TO THE BLOOD DRIVE?

08:51.197 --> 08:53.100
I MAY NOT HAVE FOUND OUT
ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.534
THANK GOD YOU DID, RIGHT?

08:55.568 --> 08:58.572
- THIS IS JUST
REALLY BAD TIMING.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

08:58.605 --> 09:01.942
IT'S NEVER A GOOD TIME
TO GET THAT KIND OF NEWS.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.677
OR TO BE THE ONE
GIVING IT.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.678
I MEAN, I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.215
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT
IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO TELL
SARA AND BRENNA.

09:10.984 --> 09:14.254
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WE NEED TO SCHEDULE
A BONE-MARROW BIOPSY

09:14.288 --> 09:15.688
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.258
AND I KNOW IT'S THE WEEKEND,
BUT IF I WERE YOU

09:18.292 --> 09:20.793
I'D SPEAK TO MY BOSS

09:20.826 --> 09:22.729
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER,
'KAY?

09:22.763 --> 09:24.197
I'M GOING TO THE OFFICE TODAY.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.937
( phones ringing )

09:31.705 --> 09:33.273
( elevator dings )

09:39.879 --> 09:42.849
LAWRENCE,
IS THERE A GOOD TIME
TODAY THAT WE CAN TALK?

09:42.883 --> 09:44.150
YOU'RE TALKING TO ME
RIGHT NOW.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.187
UM, IT'S KINDA PRIVATE.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.187
- THEN TELL ME LATER.
- ( mouths )

09:48.221 --> 09:50.090
I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.192
BRUCE HENDRIE'S ANNOUNCING
HIS CANDIDACY FOR GOVERNOR
ON MONDAY.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.729
GONNA NEED YOUR PROFILE
SOONER THAN WE THOUGHT.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.097
- OKAY.
- THIS IS RAQUEL.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.167
SHE'S OUR NEW SENIOR
POLITICAL WRITER.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.868
SHE'LL BE HELPING YOU
ON THE HENDRIE PIECE.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.205
RAQUEL, THIS IS APRIL.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.140
SHE'S YOUNG, AMBITIOUS
AND INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.

10:08.174 --> 10:11.110
JUST LIKE YOU WERE
WHEN YOU INTERNED FOR ME
AT ABC NEWS.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.779
- SO YOU'RE AN INTERN?
- WE CALL 'EM FLOATERS HERE.

10:13.813 --> 10:15.716
- THAT'S JUST CRUEL, LAWRENCE.
- APRIL'S ACTUALLY

10:15.749 --> 10:18.250
- A NEWLY-MINTED STAFFER.
- OH, CONGRATS.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.355
SO SOMEONE ELSE WILL HAVE
TO GET LAWRENCE'S SCRAMBLED
EGG WHITES EVERY MORNING?

10:21.388 --> 10:23.255
- EXTRA-DRY.
- GREAT.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.293
YOU'VE BONDED.
NOW GET TO WORK.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.903
BRENNA, COME HERE.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.337
I HAVE HOMEWORK.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.740
OH, COME ON.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.774
I'M TRYING OUT MY NEW
MOROCCAN COOKBOOK.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.777
LET ME KNOW IF
THIS IS TOO GREASY.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.711
LAMB CAN BE
SUCH A FATTY MEAT.

10:47.246 --> 10:48.648
I CAN'T.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.317
( sighs )

10:50.350 --> 10:53.153
OH.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.221
YES. HEY, WOULD YOU
PLEASE TEXT APRIL

10:55.254 --> 10:57.390
AND SEE IF SHE'S
COMING HOME FOR DINNER?

10:57.423 --> 10:59.259
MY PHONE'S UPSTAIRS.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.160
THAT'S IT!
I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

11:01.193 --> 11:03.330
YOU'RE MAKING EYE CONTACT.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.197
I'M SO USED TO LOOKING
AT THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD.

11:05.231 --> 11:06.866
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN
AT THAT SCREEN.

11:06.899 --> 11:09.068
TO WHAT DO I OWE
THIS HONOR?

11:09.101 --> 11:12.205
MAYBE I JUST WANNA
SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.908
WELL, I WON'T
ARGUE WITH THAT.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.109
( cellphone ringing )

11:21.048 --> 11:22.215
HOW ARE YOU CALLING ME?

11:22.249 --> 11:23.250
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:25.317 --> 11:28.455
HELLO?
WHO IS THIS?

11:28.687 --> 11:30.791
KIERAN WHO?
DID YOU LEAVE YOUR PHONE

11:30.823 --> 11:32.359
AT THE SOUP KITCHEN
LAST NIGHT?

11:34.727 --> 11:36.897
AT A PARTY IN CHARLESTOWN?

11:39.765 --> 11:41.134
( sighs )

11:41.168 --> 11:43.970
UM, YEAH NO, UH--

11:44.004 --> 11:46.373
WHERE DO YOU WORK?

11:46.405 --> 11:50.911
OKAY, NO, SHE'S COMING
RIGHT NOW TO GET IT.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.113
THANK YOU.

11:53.145 --> 11:56.015
- I DON'T KNOW ANYONE--
- PLEASE, DON'T LIE
TO ME, BRENNA.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.118
I'M DONE WITH THE LIES.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.153
WERE YOU AT A PARTY
LAST NIGHT?

12:01.187 --> 12:03.190
YEAH.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.356
( sharply sighs )

12:04.390 --> 12:06.293
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.195
I'VE GOT A PATIENT
IN HALF AN HOUR.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.129
HERE, TAKE THE ORANGE LINE
TO BACK BAY.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.432
GET YOUR PHONE.
COME STRAIGHT HOME.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.807
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WON ALL THESE.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.009
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A NERD.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.077
JOURNALISM'S ALL
I EVER WANTED TO DO.

12:25.111 --> 12:28.081
ME TOO.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.484
ALL THE MORE REASON
I'M EXCITED TO WORK TOGETHER.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.086
AND WHEN I SAY TOGETHER,
I MEAN THAT.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.989
I MAY TECHNICALLY BE
YOUR SUPERIOR,

12:36.022 --> 12:38.125
BUT WE WORK
FOR THE SAME PAPER.
WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.460
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE GIRLS

12:40.494 --> 12:42.461
THAT GETS ALL COMPETITIVE
WITH OTHER GIRLS.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.230
- UGH, I HATE THOSE GIRLS.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.133
- WE'RE SO MUCH
BETTER THAN THEM.
- ( laughs )

12:47.900 --> 12:51.138
SO CAN I GIVE YOU
MY TWO CENTS ON THIS
HENDRIE PROFILE?

12:51.171 --> 12:53.373
YEAH, PLEASE.
SHOOT.

12:53.405 --> 12:56.308
LAWRENCE WAS TELLING ME
HOW YOU SCORED AN EXCLUSIVE

12:56.342 --> 12:58.077
WITH RICHIE MIRANDA
THE OTHER DAY.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.947
AND I'M GUESSING IT INVOLVED
SOME SUPER-DARING,

13:00.980 --> 13:02.849
POSSIBLY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY?

13:02.883 --> 13:04.417
NO COMMENT.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.951
GOOD GIRL.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.187
PATIENCE HAS NEVER BEEN
ONE OF MY VIRTUES EITHER.

13:08.221 --> 13:11.524
BUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL,
IT'S NOT ABOUT ONE STORY.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.826
IT'S ABOUT GETTING
THE CANDIDATE TO TRUST YOU

13:13.860 --> 13:15.261
ALL THE WAY
TILL ELECTION DAY.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.197
SO YOU REALLY WANNA LEARN
EVERYTHING YOU CAN
ABOUT THIS GUY.

13:18.230 --> 13:22.067
TAKE A LITTLE TIME
AND BECOME AN EXPERT
ON ALL THINGS BRUCE HENDRIE.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.203
YOU'RE GONNA NAIL THIS.

13:24.236 --> 13:26.239
AND SPEAKING OF NAILS...

13:26.273 --> 13:27.874
THE DIDN'T GIVE ME
ENOUGH FOR THESE.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.375
EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.114
I HEARD SHE SPEAKS
FIVE LANGUAGES.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.447
( sighs )

13:37.017 --> 13:39.019
- ( exhales )
- SHE IS AMAZING.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.053
I HAVE A TOTAL
PROFESSIONAL CRUSH ON HER.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.190
I HAVE A TOTALLY
UNPROFESSIONAL
CRUSH ON HER.

13:43.222 --> 13:45.225
( chuckles )

13:47.594 --> 13:50.062
GET THIS--
BRUCE HENDRIE DONATED

13:50.096 --> 13:52.499
AN ENTIRE BUILDING
TO THE NEW CHILDREN'S
MUSEUM,

13:52.532 --> 13:55.869
YET SENT HIS ONLY SON
TO BOARDING SCHOOL
IN SWITZERLAND.

13:55.902 --> 13:58.404
HMM, I THOUGHT ONLY
NORTH KOREAN DICTATORS
DID THAT.

13:58.437 --> 14:01.474
YEAH.
CHECK OUT THE SON.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.610
People always ask
what it's like to be
Bruce Hendrie's son,

14:04.844 --> 14:07.346
but he's just Dad to me.

14:07.379 --> 14:10.951
I MEAN, HE'S LIKE STRAIGHT
OUT OF A J.CREW CATALOGUE.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.285
I THINK THERE ARE ACTUALLY
WHALES ON HIS BELT.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.888
THEY'RE TURTLES.

14:14.921 --> 14:17.524
DANNY, DO YOU HAVE
THAT BELT?

14:17.557 --> 14:20.025

- NO, I STILL CAN'T HEAR YOU.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.140
YOU MAY HAVE
TO COME IN HERE

HEY, DO YOU LIKE LASAGNA?

15:05.672 --> 15:07.506
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET ME ANYTHING.

15:07.539 --> 15:09.908
I'M JUST GONNA GET
LIKE FIVE BAGS OF CHIPS
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE.

15:09.942 --> 15:12.245

UH, PHONE'S OVER HERE.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.177
HEY, THANKS FOR TELLING
MY MOM I WAS AT A PARTY
LAST NIGHT.

15:44.210 --> 15:47.047
( laughs )
THAT WAS YOUR MOM?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.615
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.
- OH, COME ON.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.582
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO KNOW YOU LIVE
WITH YOUR MOM?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.184
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.431
YEAH, I CONSIDER THIS

16:04.464 --> 16:06.365
ART, NOT TORTURE.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.668
PERSONALLY, I THINK TORTURE
IS HANGING OUT WITH DOUCHEBAGS
LIKE SEAN KAVANAGH.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.604
I DON'T HANG OUT WITH SEAN.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.740

DON'T LIE.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.210
HOW DO YOU KNOW SEAN ANYWAY?

16:17.243 --> 16:19.078
HE'S FRIENDS

16:19.111 --> 16:22.315
WHO UNFORTUNATELY
HANGS OUT WITH IDIOTS.
BUT MAYBE YOU'RE INTO IT.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.283
OR, I MEAN, YOU WERE
INTO IT LAST NIGHT.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.019

IT MAY BE COVERED
IN A NIETZSCHE QUOTE,
BUT IT'S IN THERE.

YOU JUST WANT ME
TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
A NIETZSCHE TATTOO.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.120

MAYBE THAT'S OKAY.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.162

EVENTUALLY, RIGHT?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.096
LOOK, IF YOU'RE GONNA
HOOK UP WITH DOMINIC,

17:11.131 --> 17:13.199
JUST MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A COLD OR ANYTHING,
OKAY?

17:13.232 --> 17:16.035

18:08.755 --> 18:11.423
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.759
I KEEP SETTING LIMITS,
YOU KEEP PUSHING BACK.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.729
I'M THE PARENT.
IF I WANNA STOP
THAT CYCLE,

18:16.762 --> 18:18.096

18:18.131 --> 18:21.166
- MOM.
- SO, YOU'RE NOT GROUNDED.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.169
- REALLY?
- BUT I WANT YOU
TO GET A JOB.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.738
- WHAT?
- I THINK IT WOULD BE
SO GOOD FOR YOU.

18:25.771 --> 18:28.307
AND JULIE IS LOOKING
FOR PART-TIME HELP
AT HER STORE.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.509
YOU REMEMBER THAT LITTLE
GIFT SHOP IN COPLEY PLACE

18:30.542 --> 18:32.778

GLASS ANIMALS?

18:32.811 --> 18:34.881

- TENDER MOMENTS.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.415

BRENNA HAD
THE MOST ADORABLE
CHARM BRACELET

18:39.219 --> 18:41.453
- FROM YOUR STORE--
- MOM, WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THIS?

18:41.488 --> 18:45.290
WE'VE JUST ALL GOTTEN
A LITTLE OFF-TRACK SINCE--

18:46.259 --> 18:48.361
YOU KNOW, THE LOSS.
IT JUST--

18:48.394 --> 18:51.230
MY MOM LOVES TO BLAME
EVERYTHING I DO ON MY DAD,

18:51.263 --> 18:54.200
BUT REALLY IT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.536
SHE'S THE ONE WHO DOESN'T
EVEN KNOW WHO I AM ANYMORE.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.240
HOW'S THAT
FOR A TENDER MOMENT?

19:04.611 --> 19:07.446
APRIL CARVER'S A 24-YEAR-OLD

BONE-MARROW BIOPSY IS
SCHEDULED FOR NEXT WEEK

19:17.155 --> 19:19.157
TO DETERMINE
LEUKEMIA SUB-TYPE.

19:20.894 --> 19:23.395
PROGNOSIS IS UNCERTAIN.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.596
( beeps )

19:29.434 --> 19:31.237
I LOVE YOUR PLACE.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.539
YOU'VE BEEN HERE
FOR FIVE SECONDS.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.776
WELL, MAYBE I JUST LIKE
BEING ALONE WITH YOU.

19:36.808 --> 19:37.911
MMM.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.280
YO.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.515
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A DATE TONIGHT.

19:42.548 --> 19:44.284
YEAH, I DID TOO.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.251
UNTIL TANYA TEXTED ME
WHEN I WAS ALREADY
AT THE RESTAURANT

19:46.286 --> 19:48.221
THAT SHE DIDN'T WANNA
SEE ME ANYMORE.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.624
SO I TRIED TO MAKE
THE BEST OF IT AND GOT
SOME CURRY TO GO.

19:51.657 --> 19:54.460
BUT OF COURSE,
SINCE IT'S ME
AND MY LIFE SUCKS,

19:54.493 --> 19:57.462
THEY PUT CASHEWS
IN IT, WHICH IS NOT
IN THE DESCRIPTION

19:57.497 --> 20:00.465
I MIGHT ADD.
AND OH, GUESS WHAT
I'M ALLERGIC TO?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.736
THEY'RE GONNA BE
REAL SORRY WHEN THEY
READ THIS REVIEW THOUGH.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.837
ONE STAR OUTTA FIVE.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.273
APRIL, THIS IS
MY ROOMMATE GRAHAM.

20:08.307 --> 20:10.343
HI.
I'M SORRY ABOUT--

20:10.375 --> 20:12.311
IT'S JUST AMAZING TIMING,
YOU KNOW?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.846
THE DAY AFTER
I GET HER FLOWERS.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.981
AND NOW I'M GETTING
TEXT MESSAGES EVERY HOUR

20:16.214 --> 20:18.684
FROM SOME FLOWER-DELIVERY APP
I'M NEVER GONNA USE AGAIN.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.887
EVEN THOUGH I SPECIFICALLY
CLICKED THAT BOX THAT SAID

20:21.921 --> 20:25.724
"NO, DO NOT SEND ME INFORMATION
ABOUT SPECIAL PROMOTIONS."

20:25.758 --> 20:27.961
I'M GONNA WRITE A REVIEW
ON THE FLOWER PLACE AFTER THIS.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.628
YOU WANT A DRINK?

20:29.662 --> 20:31.564
HELP YOURSELF
TO ANYTHING IN THE FRIDGE.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.271
- EH EH EH EH!
DON'T TOUCH THAT.
- OH, YEAH, SORRY.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.441
DON'T DRINK THE BEER
IN THE BLUE BOTTLE.

20:41.473 --> 20:44.242
IT'S NOT JUST
A BEER, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S A HOMEMADE MICROBREW

20:44.277 --> 20:46.613
WITH NOTES OF BARLEY AND COCONUT
THAT TOOK ME A WEEK TO MAKE.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.280
AND COUNTING, ACTUALLY.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.016
- I'M SORRY.
- IT'S FINE.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.884
JUST THANK GOD
YOU DIDN'T OPEN IT.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.252
OTHERWISE I'D REALLY BE
ON SUICIDE WATCH.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.355
- WANNA GO UPSTAIRS?
- YEAH.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.660
"HOW BEST TO DESCRIBE
THE PANANG CURRY?

21:00.692 --> 21:03.328
CHOCKFULL OF ALLERGENS,
FOR ONE."

21:03.363 --> 21:06.833
- ( rock music playing )
- ( man vocalizing )

21:06.865 --> 21:08.034
THAT WAS AMAZING.
SERIOUSLY,

21:08.267 --> 21:09.969
JUST TELL ME WHERE
YOU BOUGHT IT.
IT'S FINE.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.537
- I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT.
- ( chuckles )

21:11.570 --> 21:14.339
IT'S MY MOM'S RECIPE.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.009
WHY AM I TALKING
ABOUT MY MOM ON A DATE?

21:16.041 --> 21:18.310
IT'S COOL.
YOU TALKED ABOUT
MY UNCLE ON OUR LAST DATE.

21:18.344 --> 21:20.313
I HAVE A UNIQUE WAY
OF FLIRTING.

21:20.346 --> 21:21.780
( chuckles )

21:21.814 --> 21:24.049
ARE YOU EVER GONNA TELL ME
WHY YOU HATE HIM,
BY THE WAY?

21:24.282 --> 21:27.987
I DON'T HATE GEORGE.
IT'S JUST-- IT'S COMPLICATED.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.821
I KNOW I WORK
FOR THE ARTS SECTION,

21:29.855 --> 21:32.525
BUT I CAN PROBABLY
FOLLOW A COMPLEX STORY.

21:35.427 --> 21:36.929
OKAY.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.034
SO, YOU KNOW ABOUT MY DAD

21:41.067 --> 21:42.067
AND THE CAR ACCIDENT?

21:43.670 --> 21:45.471
GEORGE WAS DRIVING.

21:47.406 --> 21:48.641
- WHOA.
- YEAH.

21:48.674 --> 21:49.942
THEY WERE IN FLORIDA.

21:49.976 --> 21:52.545
MY DAD HAD A HOUSE THERE
HE USED AS A WRITING RETREAT.

21:52.577 --> 21:53.980
BUT IT WAS
AN ACCIDENT, RIGHT?

21:54.012 --> 21:55.480
YEAH NO, I KNOW.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.817
AND I KNOW HE FELT
TERRIBLE ABOUT IT,

21:57.849 --> 22:00.787
BUT HE JUST SORTA...

22:00.819 --> 22:02.488
CHECKED OUT
AFTER IT HAPPENED.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.089
HE DIDN'T EVEN
COME TO THE FUNERAL.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.326
HE WENT TO MOLDOVA FOR SOME
DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS THING,

22:07.359 --> 22:09.362
AND WAS GONE
FOR LIKE SIX MONTHS.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.699
I JUST--

22:12.731 --> 22:14.800
I DON'T GET
HOW HE COULD DO THAT

22:14.834 --> 22:16.501
WHEN WE NEEDED HIM HERE.

22:19.105 --> 22:22.107
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHY
I MOVED HOME AFTER COLLEGE

22:22.340 --> 22:24.376
TO BE HERE FOR MY MOM
AND SISTER.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.378
I'M KINDA LIKE
THE MAN OF THE HOUSE NOW.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.413
I CAN SEE THAT.

22:27.446 --> 22:29.882
- COOL, SO YOU THINK I'M MANLY.
- NO.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.551
YOU'RE STABLE,
YOU'RE SOLID.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.019
NONE OF THESE
ARE SEXY ADJECTIVES.

22:34.052 --> 22:36.388
( laughs ) PLEASE.
I JUST MEAN THAT I LIKE

22:36.422 --> 22:38.090
THAT THERE'S NO DRAMA
WITH YOU.

22:41.059 --> 22:43.061
I MEAN, I HAVE SOME DRAMA.

22:43.096 --> 22:46.932
NOT COMPARED TO A FEW GIRLS
I'VE DATED.

22:46.965 --> 22:50.670
I KNOW SOME GUYS
LOVE THAT WHOLE DAMSEL-
IN-DISTRESS THING,

22:50.702 --> 22:52.538
BUT I DON'T.

23:04.750 --> 23:05.852
CAN WE OPEN THAT?

23:08.121 --> 23:10.123
( birds chirping )

23:26.138 --> 23:29.474
HEY.
YOU FEELING OKAY?

23:29.509 --> 23:31.076
UH...

23:31.109 --> 23:33.746
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

23:33.779 --> 23:36.749
YOU JUST STAY IN HERE,
YOU SLEEP AS LONG AS
YOU NEED TO, OKAY?

23:36.782 --> 23:40.086
I'M SURE YOU NEED ALL
THE REST YOU CAN GET
IN YOUR CONDITION.

23:40.118 --> 23:41.186
( pats bed twice )

23:41.420 --> 23:43.955
- MY CONDITION?
- YEAH.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.025
DO YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT
LAST NIGHT?

23:46.057 --> 23:49.127
I KNOW WE WERE
DRINKING A LOT, BUT...

23:49.162 --> 23:52.131
DID I SAY ANYTHING WEIRD?

23:52.164 --> 23:54.666
NAH, NOT WEIRD,
BUT YEAH,

23:54.700 --> 23:56.736
IT WAS PRETTY INTENSE.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.503
JUST TAKE IT EASY,
ALL RIGHT?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.705
I'LL BE IN THE OTHER ROOM
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO GO.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.579
( groans )

24:11.550 --> 24:13.486
- Beth: Hello?
- BETH, I'M FREAKING OUT.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.121
- ARE YOU BLEEDING?
- No.

24:15.153 --> 24:16.221
- BRUISING?
- No.

24:16.454 --> 24:17.923
- SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
- UH, NO.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.792
I GOT-- I GOT WASTED
LAST NIGHT AND I THINK

24:20.826 --> 24:22.894
I TOLD DOMINIC
I HAVE CANCER.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.163
NO, WAIT, DID YOU GUYS
HAVE SEX?

24:26.065 --> 24:28.667
I DON'T THINK SO.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.836
( exhales )
WHAT IF WE HAD SEX

24:30.869 --> 24:32.605
AND I TOLD HIM I HAD CANCER?

24:32.637 --> 24:33.772
OH MY--

24:33.806 --> 24:35.141
DON'T FREAK
YOURSELF OUT, OKAY?

24:35.173 --> 24:36.741
'CAUSE YOU'LL JUST
ELEVATE YOUR HEART RATE

24:36.776 --> 24:38.176
AND THEN YOU'LL FEEL
MORE FATIGUED WHEN YOU--

24:38.211 --> 24:39.177
You know what?
Forget it.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.613
I GOTTA GO.
HE'S GONNA HEAR ME.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.217
( exhales )

24:46.986 --> 24:49.588
Emma:
I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.891
DID YOU HEAR MOM'S
MAKING ME GET A JOB?

24:51.923 --> 24:54.492
- I'D RATHER BE GROUNDED.
- THAT WOULD BE SO GREAT.

24:54.527 --> 24:57.563
- IF I WERE GROUNDED?
- YEAH.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.065
I COULD USE A BUDDY
AROUND HERE.

24:59.097 --> 25:01.767
THERE'S ALWAYS SO MUCH WORK
TO DO AROUND THE HOUSE.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.037
AND AS YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT EXACTLY
THE HOMEMAKER TYPE.

25:05.070 --> 25:08.173
BUT, UH, WE COULD
HAVE FUN TOO.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.743
YOU KNOW I CAUGHT
PEARL CHEATING AT
OUR LAST BRIDGE GAME.

25:13.144 --> 25:15.780
I'D LOVE TO REPLACE HER.

25:15.815 --> 25:19.184
WE MEET EVERY AFTERNOON
3:00 TO 5:00.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.819
ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.888
YES.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.089
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

25:24.123 --> 25:26.192
BECAUSE MY MOM
ASKED YOU TO.

25:26.224 --> 25:29.194
NO, ACTUALLY YOUR MOM
ASKED ME NOT TO.

25:29.228 --> 25:32.565
BUT I DO WHAT I WANT
BECAUSE I'M THE MOM.

25:32.597 --> 25:36.102
AND SHE'S YOUR MOM.

25:36.134 --> 25:40.839
AND EVEN THOUGH I KNOW
HER APPROACH CAN BE
ANNOYING SOMETIMES,

25:40.873 --> 25:43.241
SHE TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.113
SO JUST...

25:47.145 --> 25:49.315
TRY TO CUT HER
SOME SLACK.

25:54.119 --> 25:56.721
- AHEM.
- HEY.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.057
I MADE COFFEE.
BUT I DON'T KNOW--
CAN YOU HAVE THAT?

25:59.090 --> 26:00.292
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:00.326 --> 26:02.060
IT MIGHT JUST
MAKE YOU MORE SICK.

26:02.094 --> 26:05.064
- YOU THINK?
- YOU TELL ME.

26:05.096 --> 26:07.732
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

26:07.767 --> 26:10.568
I KNOW THAT WHEN I'M HUNG-OVER
IT'S THE FIRST THING I WANT.

26:10.603 --> 26:12.637
BUT TECHNICALLY COFFEE
DEHYDRATES YOU, SO...

26:12.672 --> 26:14.039
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
MY HANGOVER.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.307
UH, YEAH.
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

26:15.340 --> 26:17.643
WHO SAYS ALCOHOL
DOESN'T KILL BRAIN CELLS?

26:17.676 --> 26:19.045
SHUT UP.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.779
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.115
Dominic: MMM.

26:23.148 --> 26:25.084
OHH.

26:25.116 --> 26:27.219
IT IS A GOOD THING
THAT I GOT DUMPED LAST NIGHT.

26:27.252 --> 26:31.089
OTHERWISE THERE'D BE
A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THIS APARTMENT RIGHT NOW.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.960
AND NO MORE COFFEE.
OF COURSE.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.134
HEY, HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

26:42.167 --> 26:45.037
YEAH, I'M HUNG-OVER.
IT'S A WEEKEND.
I'M ALLOWED.

26:45.070 --> 26:48.007
ACTUALLY I DIDN'T
EVEN NOTICE.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.142
BUT NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT, YOU DO LOOK
A LITTLE ROUGH TODAY.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.077
SO WHAT DID YOU MEAN,
HOW AM I HOLDING UP?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.380
AFTER GETTING PULLED OFF
THE BRUCE HENDRIE ASSIGNMENT?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.982
I DIDN'T GET
PULLED OFF ANYTHING.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.085
OH, I-- I JUST ASSUMED.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.086
I OVERHEARD TASHA CONFIRMING
RAQUEL'S INTERVIEW

27:01.119 --> 27:02.887
WITH BRUCE HENDRIE
AT HIS OFFICE THIS MORNING.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.759
WAIT.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.160
DID YOU NOT KNOW?

27:08.193 --> 27:10.128
SHE'S TRYING
TO SABOTAGE ME.

27:10.162 --> 27:13.065
WHOA.
SHE'S RUTHLESS.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.299
GOD, THAT--

27:14.333 --> 27:16.134
THAT MAKES HER EVEN HOTTER.

27:27.712 --> 27:28.681
RAQUEL.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.416
- OH. HEY, APRIL.
- REALLY?

27:31.650 --> 27:34.252
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
PRETEND LIKE YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO STEAL MY INTERVIEW RIGHT NOW?

27:34.286 --> 27:36.221
I'M NOT STEALING
ANYTHING.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.990
I'M YOUR SUPERVISOR
ON THIS STORY

27:38.023 --> 27:39.991
AND I DECIDED THAT
YOU'RE NOT READY

27:40.026 --> 27:41.760
FOR THIS LEVEL
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

27:41.794 --> 27:44.829
YOU JUST MET ME.
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
IF I'M READY?

27:44.864 --> 27:47.833
IF YOU WERE READY,
YOU WOULD HAVE MADE
THIS APPOINTMENT YOURSELF.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.102
YESTERDAY.
BEFORE I GOT TO IT.

27:50.135 --> 27:52.971
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT TOLD ME--
- LOOK, APRIL, THIS ISN'T
PERSONAL.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.075
IT'S A TOUGH BUSINESS.
NO ONE'S GONNA WATCH
YOUR BACK.

28:05.718 --> 28:08.220
( coughing )

28:08.253 --> 28:10.056
( panting )

28:10.088 --> 28:12.191
MIGHT WANNA CONSIDER
A GYM MEMBERSHIP.

28:12.223 --> 28:15.361
( breathing heavily )

28:15.394 --> 28:17.997
( motorcycle approaching )

28:18.029 --> 28:19.030
WATCH IT.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.002
OH!
OH MY GOD!

28:24.036 --> 28:25.203
ARE YOU OKAY?

28:25.237 --> 28:27.740
( groans )
IN SPITE OF YOU?

28:27.772 --> 28:29.375
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
BLAMING ME?

28:29.407 --> 28:31.977
YOU'RE THE ONE
DOING EXTREME SPORTS
IN A PARKING LOT.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.182
YOU'RE LEO HENDRIE.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.351
( scoffs )
ONE OF MY DAD'S NEW INTERNS?

28:39.384 --> 28:41.119
YOU GUYS HOOKING UP?

28:41.153 --> 28:42.387
CAN I CALL YOU "MOM"?

28:42.421 --> 28:44.890
DO YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'RE BLEEDING?

28:46.092 --> 28:48.059
OH, I DO NOW.
THANKS.

28:48.094 --> 28:51.163
UM, YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE.
YOU DAMAGED THAT CAR.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.898
AWW, YOU'RE SUCH
A GOOD PERSON.

29:04.175 --> 29:05.877
( radio playing softly )

29:08.980 --> 29:11.116
I'LL BE DONE IN A SECOND.

29:11.150 --> 29:12.852
OKAY.

29:12.884 --> 29:15.788
NOT LITERALLY A SECOND.
CAN YOU JUST COME BACK?

29:20.159 --> 29:21.292
WAIT.

29:23.028 --> 29:23.996
WHAT'S WRONG?

29:25.498 --> 29:27.932
( deeply sighs )
I HAD A CRAPPY DAY AT WORK.

29:27.967 --> 29:31.237
THIS NEW GIRL RAQUEL IS,
LIKE, OUT TO GET ME.

29:31.269 --> 29:34.006
- CAN YOU TELL ON HER?
- I DON'T THINK MY BOSS
WOULD EVEN CARE.

29:34.038 --> 29:36.342
REPORTERS STEAL
STORIES ALL THE TIME.
IT'S LIKE PART OF THE JOB.

29:36.375 --> 29:39.010
BUT IT'S STILL
EMBARRASSING.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.383
IT'S NOT AS EMBARRASSING
AS THINKING THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO A PARTY

29:44.415 --> 29:47.019
WITH A GUY THAT YOU LIKE,
AND THEN REALIZE THAT

29:47.051 --> 29:49.154
HE'S TRYING TO SET YOU UP
WITH HIS GROSS FRIEND.

29:49.188 --> 29:51.390
- THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED?
- YEAH.

29:51.423 --> 29:55.126
AND I DIDN'T WANT THEM
TO THINK THAT I WAS SOME
STUCK-UP PRIVATE-SCHOOL GIRL,

29:55.161 --> 29:56.961
SO I STARTED HOOKING UP
WITH HIM--

29:56.996 --> 29:59.030
DID YOU HAVE SEX?
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.299
- I JUST-- I'M SORRY.
- NO.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.002
PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
IF I DIDN'T...

30:04.036 --> 30:06.005
- PUKE ON HIM FIRST.
- NO.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.007
( laughs )

30:08.039 --> 30:09.842
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.242
IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.278
WELL, LUCKILY THEY DON'T
GO TO MY SCHOOL

30:13.311 --> 30:15.013
SO I NEVER HAVE
TO SEE THEM AGAIN.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.949
WHERE ARE YOU GOING ANYWAY?

30:16.981 --> 30:20.885
MOM'S MAKING ME
GET A JOB, SO I'M GONNA GO
PICK UP SOME APPLICATIONS.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.988
- I'LL LET YOU GET READY.
- 'KAY.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.222
WAIT, APE.

30:26.258 --> 30:29.394
YOU'RE NOT REALLY GONNA
LET RAQUEL WIN, ARE YOU?

30:30.596 --> 30:32.431
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

30:37.269 --> 30:40.271
( hip-hop music playing )

30:42.074 --> 30:44.576
Girl:
YOU HAVE TO WORK
AT THAT DOLL STORE.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.278
SERIOUSLY, HOW CREEPY
WOULD IT BE

30:46.311 --> 30:47.980
IF YOU WORKED
AT A DOLL STORE?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.914
I WILL FILL OUT
THAT APPLICATION FOR YOU.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.151
THAT'S HOW MUCH
I WANT YOU TO WORK THERE.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.286
THANKS FOR JOB-HUNTING
WITH ME.

30:54.319 --> 30:57.122
PLEASE.
IT WAS FUN.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.592
BESIDES, YOU ALREADY
MADE IT UP TO ME
BY BRINGING ME HERE.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.528
THESE GUYS ARE
TOTALLY MY TYPE.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.029
ESPECIALLY THAT ONE
OVER THERE.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.633
HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAD
A BAD CHILDHOOD.

31:07.865 --> 31:10.301
I DON'T THINK
THAT GUY REMEMBERS IT.
HE'S LIKE 40.

31:10.336 --> 31:13.005
OH, KIERAN.
THIS IS MY FRIEND FORD.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.640
FORD.
THAT'S A COOL NAME.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.474
THANKS.
IT WAS MY MOM'S.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.376
SHE GOES BY HER MOM'S
MAIDEN NAME.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.645
IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO AFTER SHE
GAVE IT UP FOR A MAN.

31:20.878 --> 31:24.182
SO THEN YOU GAVE UP
YOUR NAME FOR YOUR MOM'S?

31:25.183 --> 31:27.185
HEY, SEAN.
LOOK WHO IT IS.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.954
THIS GIRL HAS AN AMAZING
PARTY TRICK, DUDE.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.589
AS SOON AS YOU
TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS,

31:31.624 --> 31:33.625
SHE PROJECTILE VOMITS
ALL OVER YOU.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.334
- BRENNA, BRENNA, BRENN--
- WHATEVER. DON'T TALK TO ME.

31:42.367 --> 31:44.435
YEAH, SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO BE SLUT-SHAMED BY YOU.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.971
NOT THAT
YOU'RE A SLUT.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.673
HONESTLY,
I DID NOT KNOW THAT
THEY WERE COMING.

31:47.905 --> 31:49.907
LIKE I SAID,
SEAN IS FRIENDS
WITH MY BROTHER.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.577
I WOULDN'T HAVE
INVITED YOU IF I KNEW
THAT HE WAS BRINGING THEM.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.580
- ( sighs )
- HERE HERE, I NEED
YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING.

31:55.614 --> 31:59.151
THEY BOTH WANT
THIS DESIGN ON
THEIR BACKS.

31:59.183 --> 32:00.618
CHINESE CHARACTERS,
REALLY?

32:00.653 --> 32:03.288
- ORIGINAL.
- I KNOW. I THOUGHT
THEY CAN DO BETTER,

32:03.321 --> 32:05.624
SO I FIGURED I'D TAKE
SOME ARTISTIC LICENSE

32:05.657 --> 32:09.028
AND GIVE THEM THIS
INSTEAD.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.396
( Brenna chuckling )
"I AM SLOW."

32:11.430 --> 32:13.231
ARE YOU REALLY
GONNA DO THAT?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.567
WHY NOT?

32:15.601 --> 32:18.403
I DON'T KNOW.
CAN'T YOU GET FIRED?

32:18.436 --> 32:20.105
YEAH, MAYBE I'D WORRY
ABOUT THAT IF I THOUGHT

32:20.138 --> 32:22.441
THEY WERE SMART ENOUGH
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

32:22.473 --> 32:24.509
BUT I THINK THE SECRET'S
SAFE WITH US.

32:24.542 --> 32:26.211
( laughs )

32:28.247 --> 32:29.448
HEY.

32:31.349 --> 32:33.618
♪ OH, OH-OH. ♪

32:37.489 --> 32:39.325
HEY, GRANDMA.

32:39.357 --> 32:42.294
- HEY, MOM.
- HEY.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.962
HAVE A SEAT, KIDDO,
AND HELP ME MAKE A WORD

32:44.997 --> 32:46.632
OUT OF THESE
CRAPPY LETTERS.

32:46.664 --> 32:50.169
THAT'S OKAY, GRANDMA.
I'M NOT REALLY IN
A BOARD-GAME MOOD.

32:50.201 --> 32:53.538
I, UM... I GOT A JOB.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.275
IT'S JUST
THREE TIMES A WEEK

32:56.307 --> 32:59.144
FROM 4:00 TO 8:00
ANSWERING PHONES,
BUT THAT COUNTS, RIGHT?

32:59.177 --> 33:01.145
WHERE?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.548
IT'S BASICALLY
AN ART GALLERY.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.416
"BASICALLY"?

33:05.451 --> 33:08.386
YEAH, THEY DO, LIKE,
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ART.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.355
LIKE VISUAL ART.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.391
HERE, MET ME SHOW YOU
THEIR WEBSITE.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.729
JUST DON'T GET
FREAKED OUT--

33:16.761 --> 33:19.097
A TATTOO PARLOR?!

33:19.131 --> 33:20.699
MOM, NO, IT'S NOT.

33:20.732 --> 33:23.201
"BEST OF BOSTON:
TATTOOS AND BODY ART."

33:24.569 --> 33:27.172
( huffs )
BRENNA, THIS IS NOT
THE KIND OF JOB

33:27.205 --> 33:29.040
I HAD IN MIND,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

33:29.074 --> 33:30.209
YEAH, I KNOW YOU'D SAY THAT.

33:30.241 --> 33:31.710
THEN WHY DID YOU DO IT?

33:31.743 --> 33:34.046
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

33:34.078 --> 33:36.048
I'LL JUST QUIT
BEFORE MY FIRST DAY.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.316
COOL.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.050
( sighs )

33:40.486 --> 33:43.122
SHE DID DO WHAT YOU ASKED.

33:43.154 --> 33:44.789
SHE'S PURPOSELY
TESTING ME.

33:45.022 --> 33:47.025
MAYBE THAT'S JUST
WHO SHE IS.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.529
( sighs )
OKAY, MOM, TIME'S UP.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.564
REALLY,
DO YOU HAVE A WORD?

33:52.597 --> 33:54.298
- I HAVE A FEW WORDS.
- OH.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.300
I'M KEEPING THEM TO MYSELF.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.674
- Lawrence: YEAH.
- ( phones ringing )

34:03.709 --> 34:05.810
OH, YEAH.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY

34:06.044 --> 34:07.613
THAT LAST TIME
I WAS IN NEW YORK.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.081
LAWRENCE,
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

34:09.114 --> 34:11.817
YOU'D SAVE SO MUCH TIME
IF YOU JUST STARTED TALKING.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.552
SORRY.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.253
OKAY, AS YOU KNOW,

34:15.286 --> 34:17.655
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT PROFILE
ON BRUCE HENDRIE.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.793
AND I'M SO GLAD
RAQUEL TOOK OVER THAT

34:20.826 --> 34:22.661
INITIAL INTERVIEW
TO WARM HIM UP.

34:22.693 --> 34:25.530
NOW I CAN DIG
INTO THE MORE PERSONAL
SIDES OF THE CAMPAIGN.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.666
I HAVE A PITCH
FOR MY FIRST PIECE.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.568
BRUCE'S SON LEO.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.804
I MET HIM OUTSIDE
OF BRUCE'S OFFICE YESTERDAY,

34:31.836 --> 34:36.108
AND HE WAS NOT
WHAT I THOUGHT BASED ON
ALL THE OFFICIAL PHOTOS.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.608
SO I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.711
AND I GUESS HE'S
BEEN LIVING IN PARIS
FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.547
AND HE WAS ARRESTED
AT AN AIRPORT
IN SWITZERLAND

34:42.581 --> 34:44.615
LAST FALL
FOR TRYING TO SMUGGLE
POT THROUGH SECURITY,

34:44.650 --> 34:47.652
BUT THEY LET HIM GO,
WHICH I'M ASSUMING ISN'T
UNRELATED TO THE DONATION

34:47.686 --> 34:50.521
BRUCE RECENTLY MADE
TO THE ZURICH AIRPORT,
BUT I'LL FIND OUT FOR SURE.

34:50.556 --> 34:53.724
I FEEL LIKE IF KEEP DIGGING
THERE'S A REALLY GREAT
STORY HERE.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.561
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.762
YEAH.

34:56.795 --> 35:00.097
RAQUEL REALLY STRESSED
THE VALUE OF RESEARCH.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.867
BUT UNFORTUNATELY
BRUCE'S SON IS OFF-LIMITS.

35:03.101 --> 35:07.239
WHY?
WE PRINT PLENTY OF STORIES
ABOUT CANDIDATES' FAMILIES.

35:07.271 --> 35:11.210
IT'S NOT THAT HE'S FAMILY.
IT'S LEO HENDRIE SPECIFICALLY.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.811
TRUST ME, WE CAN'T GO THERE.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.545
IT CROSSES A LINE.

35:15.614 --> 35:16.648
I SHOULD RUN.

35:16.681 --> 35:18.717
I HAVE TO MEET
WITH MY COPY EDITOR

35:18.750 --> 35:20.585
ABOUT THE HENDRIE INTERVIEW.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.255
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIS SON,

35:23.288 --> 35:24.822
SINCE THAT CROSSES A LINE.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.594
THANKS.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.864
DON'T LET THE FACT
THAT I'VE NIXED YOUR
LAST TWO STORY PITCHES

35:32.898 --> 35:35.199
MAKE YOU STOP
TAKING RISKS AROUND HERE.

35:35.233 --> 35:37.568
I KNOW YOU'RE ANXIOUS
TO GET YOUR NAME IN THE PAPER,

35:37.603 --> 35:39.605
BUT YOU'RE ONLY,
WHAT, 12 YEARS OLD?

35:39.637 --> 35:41.572
- 24.
- EXACTLY.

35:41.606 --> 35:43.307
AND YOU'RE AHEAD
OF THE GAME.

35:43.342 --> 35:45.344
YOU'LL GET THAT
BYLINE SOON.

36:13.371 --> 36:14.338
QUESTION.

36:14.373 --> 36:17.342
UH, THIS IS JUST, UM--

36:17.376 --> 36:20.177
- DOMINIC AND I--
- I DON'T CARE WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH YOU GUYS.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.280
IF YOU WANNA HOOK UP
WITH SOMEONE WHOSE
BIGGEST SCOOP

36:22.313 --> 36:24.650
IS THE IMPACT OF SKRILLEX
ON SOCIETY, GO FOR IT.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.684
WHAT I WANNA KNOW IS...

36:26.717 --> 36:28.353
WHO'S NATALIE ORTIZ?

36:28.387 --> 36:30.489
I DON'T KNOW.
WHO IS SHE?

36:30.521 --> 36:33.659
SOME GIRL WHOSE CAR
YOU TOOK A PICTURE OF.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.893
- WHY?
- THAT WAS IN MY DESK.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.896
YEP, AND NOW IT'S NOT.

36:37.929 --> 36:40.865
NATALIE ORTIZ RENTED
THIS CAR TWO DAYS AGO AT LOGAN

36:40.898 --> 36:42.233
AND RETURNED IT TODAY.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.534
AND IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,

36:43.568 --> 36:46.204
SHE DID NOT CHOOSE TO UPGRADE
HER LIABILITY INSURANCE.

36:46.237 --> 36:48.840
NOW TELL ME WHAT STORY
YOU'RE TRYING TO BREAK
ABOUT HER.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.777
- THAT'S NOT FOR WORK.
- DON'T LIE.

36:51.809 --> 36:53.512
SERIOUSLY, WHO IS SHE?

36:54.579 --> 36:58.416
( rock music playing )

37:11.530 --> 37:13.565
♪ PENTECOSTAL PREACHER ♪

37:13.599 --> 37:16.233
♪ IN A BACKYARD BARN ♪

37:16.268 --> 37:19.503
♪ DADDY'S DRINKING WHISKEY
FROM A MASON JAR. ♪

37:21.739 --> 37:23.909
HEY.
CAN WE TALK?

37:23.942 --> 37:26.411
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?

37:27.813 --> 37:30.882
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO QUIT YOUR NEW JOB.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.550
REALLY?

37:32.583 --> 37:35.519
BUT IF YOU
COME HOME WITH EVEN
ONE LITTLE TATTOO--

37:35.554 --> 37:36.755
NO, I WON'T.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.023
I'M ONLY THE RECEPTIONIST.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.362
( sighs )
SO, I THOUGHT A LOT

37:43.394 --> 37:45.530
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER DAY,

37:45.563 --> 37:47.599
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME
NOT BEING THERE FOR YOU.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.867
- I WAS JUST MAD.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

37:49.900 --> 37:53.304
I MEAN, I WANT YOU TO FEEL
LIKE YOU CAN BE HONEST WITH ME.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.306
IF I EXPECT YOU
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH,

37:55.340 --> 37:57.342
I NEED TO BE ABLE
TO HEAR IT.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.380
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN AS PRESENT FOR YOU

38:01.413 --> 38:04.282
SINCE YOUR DAD DIED.
FAIR.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.818
I'LL WORK ON THAT.
WHAT ELSE?

38:06.851 --> 38:09.454
WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING?

38:09.487 --> 38:12.523
BECAUSE THAT'S MY THING.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.795
OKAY, WELL...

38:17.829 --> 38:22.034
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
I'M NOT TURNING OUT
HOW YOU WANT ME TO BE.

38:23.402 --> 38:24.670
LIKE, YOU KEEP
TALKING ABOUT

38:24.702 --> 38:26.405
ALL THESE THINGS
THAT WE USED TO DO

38:26.438 --> 38:28.507
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
LIKE YOU WANT ME
TO GO BACK TO THAT,

38:28.539 --> 38:30.775
BUT I'M OLDER NOW.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.543
I KNOW THAT.
I KNOW.

38:32.577 --> 38:34.679
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.516
I GUESS...

38:37.548 --> 38:41.519
I BRING UP THE PAST
BECAUSE I MISS...

38:41.552 --> 38:44.021
HOW MUCH YOU USED
TO WANNA BE AROUND ME.

38:45.690 --> 38:48.326
LIKE WHEN I'D TAKE YOU
TO BUY THOSE LITTLE
GLASS ANIMALS

38:48.360 --> 38:50.094
AND WE'D GO OUT
FOR A HOT PRETZEL
AFTERWARDS.

38:50.327 --> 38:52.764
I MISS...

38:52.797 --> 38:54.932
HAVING THAT TIME
WITH MY LITTLE GIRL.

38:54.965 --> 38:58.436
I KNOW YOU'RE OLDER NOW
AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN
LIFE NOW.

38:58.469 --> 39:01.039
LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE WORKING
IN A TATTOO PARLOR.

39:01.072 --> 39:02.373
( both chuckle )

39:02.407 --> 39:04.608
CAN YOU STOP CALLING IT
A TATTOO PARLOR?

39:04.643 --> 39:06.110
HONEY, I'M LETTING YOU
WORK THERE.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.646
I'M GONNA CALL IT
WHATEVER I WANT.

39:12.983 --> 39:16.621
- I'VE BEEN
THE WORST FRIEND EVER.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:16.655 --> 39:19.490
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.
EVER SINCE YOU TOLD ME,

39:19.523 --> 39:22.059
I'VE BEEN ACTING REALLY WEIRD.
I MEAN, I FEEL REALLY WEIRD,

39:22.094 --> 39:24.396
SO I MUST BE ACTING
REALLY WEIRD.
I AM, RIGHT?

39:24.429 --> 39:26.530
KINDA, YEAH.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.632
I'M SORRY.

39:28.666 --> 39:30.936
I'VE NEVER HAD TO DEAL
WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.106
AND I-- I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW TO MAKE THIS EASIER FOR YOU.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.007
I DON'T KNOW.

39:36.041 --> 39:40.945
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
I HAVE CANCER DOESN'T MEAN
I'M SOME CANCER EXPERT NOW.

39:40.978 --> 39:42.780
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I NEED.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.391
OH, WHO CARES
WHAT HE THINKS?

39:53.425 --> 39:56.527
HEY, DUDE, I ORDERED US
COFFEE LIKE 10 MINUTES AGO,

39:56.561 --> 39:57.728
SO CAN WE SPEED IT UP HERE?

39:57.762 --> 40:00.030
MY FRIEND HAS CANCER.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.032
- OH MY GOD.
- ( laughs )

40:02.067 --> 40:04.034
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THAT.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.637
I'M SO--
I'M SORRY.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.940
NO, THIS IS GOOD!

40:08.974 --> 40:10.041
THIS IS WHAT I NEED.

40:10.074 --> 40:13.644
KEEP ME LAUGHING.
MAKE CANCER JOKES.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.146
IF I CAN'T LAUGH
ABOUT THIS WITH SOMEONE,

40:15.179 --> 40:16.947
- I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT.
- OKAY.

40:16.981 --> 40:19.550
SO KEEP BEING
INAPPROPRIATE
AND INSENSITIVE.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.552
CHECK.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.853
AND KEEP TALKING ABOUT
YOUR LIFE.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.190
SO KEEP TELLING YOU
ABOUT MY STUPID DRAMA

40:25.422 --> 40:26.958
AND BAD DECISIONS--
CHECK.

40:26.992 --> 40:29.126
I JUST DON'T WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE ALL ABOUT

40:29.161 --> 40:31.797
ME HAVING CANCER NOW,
YOU KNOW?

40:31.829 --> 40:34.132
WELL, UH...

40:34.166 --> 40:36.601
YOU KNOW, SINCE YOUR LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT--

40:36.635 --> 40:38.503
YOU SLEPT WITH MIKE AGAIN,
DIDN'T YOU?

40:38.536 --> 40:40.172
I KNOW.
WHY DO I KEEP DOING THAT?

40:40.204 --> 40:42.440
- I HATE HIM.
- BECAUSE YOU HAVE
NO SELF-CONTROL.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.074
WELL, YOU HAVE
NO WHITE BLOOD CELLS.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.077
( laughing )

40:46.110 --> 40:48.079
( both laughing )

40:48.112 --> 40:50.581
YOU SEE? SEE?
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

40:50.614 --> 40:52.617
OKAY?
I CAN HANDLE ANYTHING.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.485
WAIT TILL I TELL YOU
ABOUT THE RANDOM GIRL I MET

40:54.518 --> 40:56.755
AT MY DAD'S GRAVE
WHO SAYS SHE'S MY SISTER.

41:01.559 --> 41:03.460
( P.A. announcement )

41:03.494 --> 41:05.630
WELL, BLOOD COUNTS ARE
STILL STABLE.

41:05.664 --> 41:07.532
GOOD.

41:07.565 --> 41:10.168
IT'S GREAT.

41:10.202 --> 41:12.204
SO WHAT'D YOUR BOSS
SAY ABOUT IT?

41:12.237 --> 41:13.938
I COULDN'T TELL HIM.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.608
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T
GET FIRED FOR BEING SICK.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.643
NO, I KNOW.
BUT I'LL GET REPLACED.

41:19.677 --> 41:23.481
I JUST GOT A PROMOTION
AND I'LL LOSE IT IF
I HAVE TO LEAVE.

41:23.514 --> 41:25.516
THIS ISN'T
JUST A JOB TO ME

41:25.550 --> 41:28.987
AND I DON'T WANNA
GIVE IT UP UNTIL I
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

41:29.019 --> 41:32.958
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND
PUTTING WORK FIRST.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.659
SO THE BIOPSY MIGHT
HAVE TO WAIT A FEW DAYS.

41:35.693 --> 41:37.963
APRIL, YOU HAVE CANCER.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.798
STOP THINKING ABOUT THINGS
IN THE SHORT-TERM.

41:40.831 --> 41:43.635
BECAUSE, BELIEVE ME,
IF YOU DON'T, THERE MAY NOT
BE A LONG-TERM.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.769
I'M NOT GONNA DIE, GEORGE.
AND I DON'T WANT

41:45.804 --> 41:48.539
TO COMPROMISE THE LIFE I HAVE
WHILE I FIGHT THIS.

41:48.572 --> 41:50.708
HOW'S YOUR MOTHER OKAY
WITH THIS MINDSET?

41:50.742 --> 41:53.677
I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET.
SHE COULDN'T HANDLE THIS
RIGHT NOW.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.713
OKAY, SO YOU'RE PUTTING
YOUR LIFE IN DANGER

41:55.746 --> 41:58.782
TO PROTECT YOUR FAMILY
AND YOUR JOB? I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU DO THAT.

41:58.817 --> 42:00.719
- I'M CALLING SARA.
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

42:00.751 --> 42:03.054
DOCTOR-PATIENT
CONFIDENTIALITY.
YOU CAN'T JUST TELL

42:03.088 --> 42:05.757
- SOMEONE I'M SICK
WITHOUT MY CONSENT.
- HEY, I'M NOT YOUR DOCTOR.

42:05.789 --> 42:08.693
WHAT IF YOU WERE?
YOU'RE THE BEST ONCOLOGIST
IN THE STATE,

42:08.726 --> 42:11.596
AND I KNOW YOU SEE PATIENTS
OUTSIDE THIS HOSPITAL
SOMETIMES.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.565
I--
( sighs )

42:13.597 --> 42:15.065
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.635
PLEASE, GEORGE.

42:18.969 --> 42:20.572
I NEED YOU.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.612
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

42:31.282 --> 42:32.717
NO, WAIT.
