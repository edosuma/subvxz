00:01.750 --> 00:03.583
(murmurs to herself)

00:04.333 --> 00:06.750
Erica: Relationships.

00:06.792 --> 00:08.583
They're like pillars
in our lives -

00:08.625 --> 00:09.917
providing support,

00:09.959 --> 00:13.583
defining the space
in which we live.

00:13.625 --> 00:14.875
Good morning.

00:14.917 --> 00:16.208
Hey, you.

00:16.250 --> 00:16.875
(clears throat)

00:16.917 --> 00:18.375
is everything okay?

00:18.417 --> 00:20.250
Yeah, everything's
fine, why?

00:20.291 --> 00:22.792
You know you're the worst
liar on the planet.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.208
(half laughs)

00:24.250 --> 00:25.583
sorry. I'm
just, uh...

00:25.625 --> 00:27.667
I'm just a little
distracted.

00:27.709 --> 00:28.709
Because...?

00:32.250 --> 00:35.083
Because the... "The
None" is launching,

00:35.125 --> 00:38.041
and Alexis owes me a draft
of the third chapter -

00:38.083 --> 00:39.125
it's four days late.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.542
Julianne is breathing down
my back...

00:40.583 --> 00:41.750
And, of course,

00:41.792 --> 00:43.542
I forgot to pick up the
dry cleaning, again.

00:43.583 --> 00:46.291
Plus we got the hydro bill
and it's crazy this month.

00:46.333 --> 00:47.834
Anything else you wanna
stress about?

00:48.667 --> 00:50.333
Point taken.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.083
Hey, I'll pick up
the dry cleaning.

00:52.125 --> 00:54.500
It's gonna be okay.
It always is.

00:54.542 --> 00:56.208
Thanks.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.917
We think of them
as solid.

00:57.959 --> 00:59.458
Immutable.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.208
The world may change around us,
but our relationships?

01:02.250 --> 01:03.333
They remain constant.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.208
No, and I agree,

01:06.250 --> 01:07.959
I think that the orgasm
chapter is compelling,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.709
but I feel like it's coming
too soon in the book.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.417
Uh, no pun intended,
I hope.

01:12.458 --> 01:14.333
And chapter three?
Where's that one, exactly?

01:14.375 --> 01:16.917
Uh, I'm hoping
it's in my inbox.

01:16.959 --> 01:20.000
(snorted laughter)

01:21.667 --> 01:22.667
(knocking)

01:25.166 --> 01:26.166
(clears throat)

01:28.291 --> 01:30.500
Hey, what're you
doing here?

01:30.542 --> 01:31.709
Just, uh...

01:31.750 --> 01:32.250
Uh...

01:32.291 --> 01:33.417
(clears throat)

01:33.458 --> 01:34.667
I didn't sleep last night.

01:34.709 --> 01:37.083
I kept thinking about
what you said.

01:37.125 --> 01:40.041
And I realized that this
was a big mistake -

01:40.083 --> 01:41.500
us becoming friends.

01:41.542 --> 01:42.625
Kai...

01:42.667 --> 01:45.333
I came back here
to have a normal life,

01:45.375 --> 01:47.500
not to screw
up yours.

01:47.542 --> 01:50.500
No, you came back
to undo a regret.

01:50.542 --> 01:51.542
At first.

01:52.166 --> 01:54.125
And then I realized
that I can do

01:54.166 --> 01:56.125
a lot more than that.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.709
I can rewrite
my whole existence.

01:57.750 --> 01:58.750
No, you can't.

01:58.792 --> 02:01.500
I can, and I was,
until you showed up.

02:01.542 --> 02:03.000
You know, getting
in the middle,

02:03.041 --> 02:05.291
between you and Ethan,
that was the old me

02:05.333 --> 02:07.291
and I won't go down
that road again.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.250
And I'm not
asking you to.

02:09.291 --> 02:12.208
We shoulda stuck to coffee
and small talk,

02:12.250 --> 02:13.125
like I said.

02:13.166 --> 02:14.375
I think that
you're overreacting.

02:14.417 --> 02:14.959
Really?

02:15.000 --> 02:16.041
Yeah.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.208
You think you can
just say that...

02:18.250 --> 02:20.542
That you feel
something for me

02:20.583 --> 02:22.542
and it doesn't
change anything?

02:22.583 --> 02:25.500
Well, not if we
don't let it.

02:26.542 --> 02:29.000
Just do yourself a favour
and stay away from me.

02:29.041 --> 02:29.583
Kai...

02:29.625 --> 02:30.792
I'm serious.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.583
I'm done with this whole
screwed up situation,

02:32.625 --> 02:34.542
this friendship...

02:34.583 --> 02:36.041
Or whatever the
hell it is.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.667
It's over.

02:37.709 --> 02:39.333
Erica: Relationships.

02:39.375 --> 02:41.875
They feel so permanent,
so solid.

02:41.917 --> 02:44.125
So why are we always
surprised to find out,

02:44.166 --> 02:46.000
that like everything else,

02:46.041 --> 02:47.542
they are not immune
to change.

um...

03:46.625 --> 03:47.625
Brent?

03:49.625 --> 03:51.583
We can't talk here.

03:51.625 --> 03:52.792
What?

03:52.834 --> 03:53.834
Why not?

03:53.875 --> 03:57.208
Count to 15
before you follow me.

03:57.625 --> 04:00.542
Second thought,
make that 20.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.250
Brent!

04:04.291 --> 04:06.291
(dishes clatter loudly)

04:11.375 --> 04:12.291
I said 20.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.542
What has gotten into you?

04:13.583 --> 04:14.583
(sighs)

04:16.500 --> 04:18.417
You've become
a cub scout?

04:18.458 --> 04:22.625
No. These two fingers
represent the pause button.

04:22.667 --> 04:23.792
On our friendship.

04:23.834 --> 04:25.166
What?

04:25.208 --> 04:27.417
River Rock publishing
is in the middle of a cold war.

04:27.458 --> 04:29.458
I'm America and
you're the USSR.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.709
That's ridiculous.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.834
Crossing enemy lines
is a mistake.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.417
It complicates things.

04:35.458 --> 04:37.583
Oh, Brent, come on.

04:37.625 --> 04:38.542
This is crazy!

04:38.583 --> 04:40.542
How long can you two
keep this up?

04:40.583 --> 04:43.667
Don't blame me,
blame Julianne.

04:47.542 --> 04:49.625
By the way,
fierce heels.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.625
I am the one that's paid
the lion's share

04:54.667 --> 04:55.792
of the mortgage!

04:55.834 --> 04:57.667
I am the one that's bought
the groceries!

04:57.709 --> 04:58.917
I paid the bills!

04:58.959 --> 05:03.083
I, I arranged and funded
all of our vacations!

05:03.125 --> 05:04.125
Hey! Sam.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.500
What's going on?

05:08.667 --> 05:09.667
Divorce papers?

05:12.750 --> 05:15.583
Wait, Josh is asking
for a divorce?

05:15.625 --> 05:17.583
Not just a divorce,
Erica.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.709
He wants to
wipe me out.

05:19.750 --> 05:22.125
Claire and Josh,
separated at birth.

05:22.166 --> 05:24.583
He wants you to pay him
$80 thousand dollars?

05:24.625 --> 05:25.583
Yup. Yup.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.125
Because, according to him,

05:27.166 --> 05:29.583
he "put me through
med school."

05:29.625 --> 05:31.166
That's ridiculous!
He didn't.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.291
(huffs)

05:32.333 --> 05:33.208
All of the signs
were there,

05:33.250 --> 05:34.208
even from the beginning,

05:34.250 --> 05:36.125
I just didn't even
wanna see them.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.333
Like what?

05:37.375 --> 05:39.667
Like...

05:39.709 --> 05:41.917
We just never talked.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.625
Never about anything
important,

05:43.667 --> 05:45.625
never about how I felt.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.875
So, of course,

05:48.917 --> 05:51.750
after a while we become
like strangers...

05:52.834 --> 05:55.834
It was like he had this
made up idea in his mind

05:55.875 --> 05:57.500
of who I was,

05:58.500 --> 06:00.709
and now here we are.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.041
You know what's really,
really pathetic?

06:05.083 --> 06:07.291
I just wanna run away
from this whole thing,

06:07.333 --> 06:11.000
so I go to goblins
like some desperate loser,

06:11.041 --> 06:12.458
looking for Kai.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.500
Kai.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.834
Really? And, uh,
how was that?

06:16.875 --> 06:18.125
He wasn't there.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.375
He quit, actually.

06:19.417 --> 06:20.917
What?!

06:20.959 --> 06:22.625
I mean, are you sure?

06:22.667 --> 06:25.500
Yeah, um, Dave said
he came in this morning

06:25.542 --> 06:27.417
and didn't give
any notice.

06:27.458 --> 06:30.000
Just walked out
the door.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.583
(phone rings)

06:31.625 --> 06:33.333
Oh, it's the lawyer
calling me back.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.333
One sec.

06:34.375 --> 06:35.208
Hello?

06:36.250 --> 06:37.709
Yes, this is Samantha.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.667
(inhales and exhales deeply)

07:07.041 --> 07:08.458
(low hum of traffic)

07:10.375 --> 07:12.375
Hey. There you go.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.208
Sorry, we're closing.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.458
I know. But,
Dave, uh...

07:15.500 --> 07:16.959
Look, I heard
that Kai quit

07:17.000 --> 07:19.792
and I really need
to talk to him.

07:19.834 --> 07:21.542
So, do you have
his phone number?

07:21.583 --> 07:23.542
He doesn't want me
giving that to anyone,

07:23.583 --> 07:24.875
especially you.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.834
Dave! Look, please.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.375
Something is going on
with him and...

07:29.417 --> 07:30.834
Kai, he loves this job.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.000
Apparently not.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.375
He didn't even give me
two weeks notice.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.333
Did he tell you that he's
quitting his band?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.417
What?!

07:40.458 --> 07:42.959
Last thing he said
before he walked out.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.750
I don't know
what's happening to him.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.250
Please, please, Dave,

07:46.291 --> 07:49.208
I really need to
talk to him.

07:51.083 --> 07:52.750
This is his address.

07:52.792 --> 07:55.500
He's not answering
his phone.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.250
You didn't get this
from me. Uh huh?

07:57.291 --> 07:57.834
Mm-mm.

07:57.875 --> 07:58.709
Mm-hm.

07:58.750 --> 07:59.333
Mmm!

07:59.375 --> 08:00.083
You don't-

08:00.125 --> 08:01.458
Oh Dave,
thank you!

08:01.500 --> 08:02.875
Okay.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.417
Thank you!
You're the best!

08:05.458 --> 08:08.125
("alive again" by champion
plays)

08:11.083 --> 08:13.333
(pounding on the door)

08:13.375 --> 08:15.291
Erica: Kai!
It's Erica!

08:17.917 --> 08:19.792
Look, I came
all this way!

08:19.834 --> 08:20.959
Uninvited.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.500
To talk to you.
Please?!

08:25.125 --> 08:26.125
Hey.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.750
Can I come in?

08:31.417 --> 08:33.166
Look, I know that
I made everything

08:33.208 --> 08:34.166
really complicated
for you

08:34.208 --> 08:35.792
and I'm sorry.

08:36.542 --> 08:38.000
Whatever. It's not
you, it's me.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.458
I screw everything up.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.375
It's always
the same bullshit.

08:41.417 --> 08:42.875
Why did you quit
your job?

08:42.917 --> 08:44.625
'cause I figured then
if I disappear,

08:44.667 --> 08:47.125
you and Ethan can go
back to being in love,

08:47.166 --> 08:49.125
Travis can have a nice
little musical career.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.166
No, that's not the way
that this works.

08:51.208 --> 08:52.959
I don't care
how this works.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.083
You can go, now.

08:54.125 --> 08:57.417
I told you to stay
away, alright.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.667
Stop trying to save me,
it's not your job.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.917
If Dr. Fred can give
up, so can you.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.667
No, Dr. Fred, he
hasn't given up.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.750
Really?

09:04.792 --> 09:06.500
Do you see him here,
laying down the law?

09:06.542 --> 09:07.750
No.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.792
Tomorrow, I tell Travis
I quit the band,

09:09.834 --> 09:11.709
then I'm gone.

He won't listen.

09:39.125 --> 09:41.041
I mean, he's being irrational
and unreasonable.

09:41.083 --> 09:42.583

Well, those are all

Right? Your life.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.458
And your choices.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.125
And, lo and behold,
your list.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.625
But I can't just ignore
what's happening to him.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.917
Kai, he has no one.

10:05.959 --> 10:08.250
I feel responsible,
and so should you.

10:08.291 --> 10:11.041
I mean, you let Dr. Fred
send me to his future

10:11.083 --> 10:11.917
for a reason.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.542
Yes. I did.

10:13.583 --> 10:16.458
And, you know, it's a decision
that I've since come to regret.

10:16.500 --> 10:17.959
Well, then why did
you agree?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.959
Because I thought that
it would help you,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.792
that it might
provide for you

10:21.834 --> 10:23.583
some useful, you know,
perspective.

10:23.625 --> 10:26.041
But instead, you've gotten
completely caught up

10:26.083 --> 10:27.875
in his life.

10:27.917 --> 10:31.542
What you need to do
is focus on yourself.

10:32.542 --> 10:33.667
Okay?

10:33.709 --> 10:35.500
So, please, sit.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.333
No.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.000
No?

10:38.041 --> 10:39.375
This is my therapy

10:39.417 --> 10:41.959
and I should be allowed
to decide what we talk about.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.125
Erica, just drop it,
okay?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.250
You're not his doctor.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.500
This is not your problem.

10:47.542 --> 10:49.208
No, because his doctor
is MIA,

10:49.250 --> 10:52.083
and Kai is out there
drowning

10:52.125 --> 10:56.291
and you are acting
like you don't even care.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.417
You could talk to him.

10:57.458 --> 10:57.959
No.

10:58.000 --> 10:58.834
Yes.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.208
You could get through
to him.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.709
You and I are not gonna
discuss this any further.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.208
You know, unlike
Dr. Fred,

11:04.250 --> 11:06.500
I don't become involved
in the lives of other patients.

11:06.542 --> 11:07.250
That's a rule.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.333
That's my rule.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.625
Fine, we are not
doing this today.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.291
Erica, come back.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.500
(door handle rattles)

11:13.542 --> 11:14.291
Open the door.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.500
Dr. Tom: Come back,

11:15.542 --> 11:17.250
and sit down in the
chair, please.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.125
Open the door!

11:21.875 --> 11:22.875
(door handle clicks)

11:25.542 --> 11:26.542
(door closes)

11:34.834 --> 11:35.834
(door closes)

11:42.542 --> 11:43.709
Everything okay?

11:53.250 --> 11:55.417
We had a disagreement.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.500
It wasn't our first,
won't be our last.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.834
Well, disagreements are a
normal part of the process.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.917
This was different.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.875
This felt like...

12:07.917 --> 12:10.750
The fights that I used
to have with Sarah.

12:10.792 --> 12:11.917
In what way?

12:11.959 --> 12:14.291
Well, you know, she and
I would get going

12:14.333 --> 12:15.417
and, uh... You know,

12:15.458 --> 12:17.667
there was never any
middle ground.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.709
It just would always end up
being an all out war.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.959
And it never accomplished
anything,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.458
it would just end
up leading...

12:25.458 --> 12:27.375
Well, you know
where it led.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.166
You lost her.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.959
Are you afraid that you
might lose Erica?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.417
I don't know. I
don't understand.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.250
I mean, I don't even know
what that was in there.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.458
(reflective inhale
and sigh)

12:41.542 --> 12:43.834
I was not a
good father

12:43.875 --> 12:46.291
and I'm aware
of that,

12:46.333 --> 12:48.083
but I am a good
therapist.

12:48.125 --> 12:51.792
Yes, but even the best
therapists miss things.

12:51.834 --> 12:55.458
What? Just tell me then,
what is the connection here?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.208
You know, why am I having
the same fight with Erica

12:58.250 --> 13:01.125
that I used to have
with my daughter?

13:01.166 --> 13:03.125
Only one way
to find out.

13:04.125 --> 13:05.583
Stop it!

13:05.625 --> 13:06.583
Sarah.

13:06.625 --> 13:07.875
Let go of me!

13:10.041 --> 13:11.125
Sarah!

13:11.166 --> 13:12.709
Forget it, dad, I'm never
coming home!

13:17.834 --> 13:18.792
Dr. Tom:
Sarah, wait!

13:18.834 --> 13:20.542
Wait! I just wanna
talk to you.

13:20.583 --> 13:23.041
Yeah, well, you never listen
to me, there's no point.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.041
Wait, wait, wait!

13:24.083 --> 13:25.291
This time I will listen.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.792
She said she doesn't
wanna talk.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.542
Yeah, just go back to
work, okay?

13:28.583 --> 13:30.959
Work? I don't care
about work.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.500
Oh, you see this?

13:33.875 --> 13:35.083
This is work,
okay?

13:35.125 --> 13:36.000
Dad...

13:36.041 --> 13:37.125
Okay, what else?
My cell phone?

13:37.166 --> 13:39.792
Work. Definitely work.
Garbage.

13:39.834 --> 13:42.375
And uh, what, watch?
You take that.

13:43.375 --> 13:44.959
No more work, okay?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.542
Dad, what's gotten
into you?

13:46.583 --> 13:48.375
You're embarrassing yourself.

13:48.417 --> 13:51.125
I want you to come and have
some lunch with me.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.500
Just lunch.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.709
One hour, that's all.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.709
Please.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.709
Okay, I'll meet you back
at the van, Martin, okay?

14:03.750 --> 14:05.083
Don't let him do this.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.667
He's just messing
with you again.

14:06.709 --> 14:09.875
I'll be fine, I
promise, okay?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.125
Just go.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.375
We leave at 5:00.

14:13.417 --> 14:14.709
Don't be late.

14:16.125 --> 14:20.041
Hey, you ready?

14:20.083 --> 14:26.917
♪

14:26.959 --> 14:28.750
You remember this place?

14:28.792 --> 14:31.166
Of course. I'm not
brain-dead.

14:33.291 --> 14:34.375
(exhales)

14:34.417 --> 14:36.250
you used to bring me
here every Sunday.

14:36.291 --> 14:37.625
We'd get strawberry
milkshakes.

14:37.667 --> 14:38.750
Yeah.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.917
With extra
whipped cream.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.750
Yeah, and you'd always
let me eat yours.

14:42.792 --> 14:43.417
(chuckles fondly)

14:43.458 --> 14:44.917
Yeah.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.000
Seems like a
lifetime ago.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.083
So what did you wanna
talk about?

14:55.125 --> 14:56.041
(sighs)

14:56.083 --> 14:57.500
You.

15:00.625 --> 15:01.792
Uh, let me guess.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.750
Okay, you hate my hair,

15:03.792 --> 15:05.208
my clothes,
my friends...

15:05.250 --> 15:05.917
Sarah...

15:05.959 --> 15:06.959
How I'm ruining my life.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.125
Sarah, I'm here

15:08.166 --> 15:10.125
because I wanna understand
what happened.

15:10.166 --> 15:14.709
I just wanna know how you
and I ended up like this.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.291
I don't know.

15:17.333 --> 15:18.583
It just happened.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.625
Listen, I understand
that the problems

15:20.667 --> 15:22.125
between your mom
and I didn't

15:22.166 --> 15:24.166
or haven't helped
the situation, but...

15:24.208 --> 15:26.583
Can we... Can we just
order already?

15:26.625 --> 15:29.208
All right. I'm just trying
to understand here.

15:29.250 --> 15:30.208
Well, you never do.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.709
You just believe
what you want.

15:31.750 --> 15:34.542
Well, maybe you
do that too.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.500
What can I
get ya?

15:37.542 --> 15:40.333
Uh, two eggs, over medium.
Multigrain toast.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.583
Uh, I'll do the mushroom
and cheese omelet, please.

15:43.625 --> 15:44.750
Anything to drink?

15:44.792 --> 15:45.834
No. Water for me.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.750
Dr. Tom: Nothing,
thanks.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.000
No, excuse me, uh...

15:48.041 --> 15:51.208
Actually, we'll have two
strawberry milkshakes,

15:51.250 --> 15:53.458
extra whipped cream.

15:56.917 --> 15:58.625
Dr. Tom: ...We couldn't
find you anywhere.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.625
You know, finally,
your mom stayed up top

16:00.667 --> 16:02.875
and I took the elevator
all the way down

16:02.917 --> 16:04.250
to the ground floor.

16:04.291 --> 16:06.792
And I got out of the elevator
and there you were,

16:06.834 --> 16:09.458
reciting the alphabet,
in French,

16:09.500 --> 16:12.750
to, uh, the security guards
at the CN Tower.

16:12.792 --> 16:14.041
And you were
little, too.

16:14.083 --> 16:16.125
You couldn't have been
more than five.

16:16.166 --> 16:19.792
Not scared though.
Nah, not one bit.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.625
Take your time.

16:22.667 --> 16:23.875
Thank you.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.583
(inhales and exhales)

16:28.917 --> 16:30.250
oh. Damn.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.875
What's wrong?

16:33.917 --> 16:37.458
My, uh, wallet
was in my jacket.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.875
Oh, no way.

16:38.917 --> 16:39.917
Way.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.667
Do you have money?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.959
I'll pay you back.
I promise.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.959
Yeah... Mmm...

16:47.333 --> 16:48.291
Three and change.

16:48.333 --> 16:49.250
That's it?

16:49.291 --> 16:49.834
Yup.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.458
Mm, not enough.

16:56.458 --> 16:57.583
Let's go.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.125
No, no. We can't
do that.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.959
What, you got
a better idea?

17:04.583 --> 17:06.959
Come on, dad,
our window's closing,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
and we need to dine
and dash now.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.458
Excuse me, sir?

17:13.500 --> 17:14.500
Sir?!

17:14.542 --> 17:15.959
(panting)

17:19.041 --> 17:21.542
(panting and laughing)

17:30.041 --> 17:32.417
(gasping for breath)

17:32.458 --> 17:33.458
(chuckling)

17:34.625 --> 17:36.375
Wow.

17:36.417 --> 17:38.125
I can't believe
you did that.

17:38.166 --> 17:39.125
Yeah, neither can I.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.000
(laughs, breathless)

17:41.041 --> 17:43.542
that is so not you.

17:43.583 --> 17:44.583
(panting)

17:45.667 --> 17:46.917
Can I ask you something?

17:47.750 --> 17:48.667
Sure.

17:50.458 --> 17:52.208
So, where are you
and Martin going?

17:53.500 --> 17:54.083
Dad.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.208
What?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.208
Come on, I don't wanna
talk about that.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.667
We're just gonna
fight, okay?

17:59.709 --> 18:02.291
Forget it then,
it's okay.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.208
Well, I should
get back.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.917
Oh, Martin said that
you had 'till five, right?

18:13.959 --> 18:15.583
(exhaling heavily)

18:16.625 --> 18:18.542
Sarah, I
really just...

18:18.583 --> 18:20.625
Just wanna tag along
with you,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.333
see how you spend
your time.

18:22.375 --> 18:24.083
I'm not gonna interfere.

18:24.125 --> 18:27.500
I'll just sit there,
won't say a word.

18:27.542 --> 18:29.250
What is it you
think I do?

18:29.291 --> 18:30.583
Steal cars?

18:30.625 --> 18:32.709
Vandalize private property?

18:32.750 --> 18:33.750
Beg?

18:33.792 --> 18:36.166
Sarah, I have no idea
what you do,

18:37.750 --> 18:39.375
and that's why
I'm asking.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.709
(papers rustle,
quiet murmuring)

18:54.083 --> 18:56.667
This is a life
drawing class.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.625
Yeah, sorry to
disappoint.

18:58.667 --> 18:59.375
Here you go.

18:59.417 --> 18:59.959
Thanks.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.041
Hey.

19:05.083 --> 19:07.291
You come here a lot?

19:07.333 --> 19:09.875
Yeah, 2 or 3
times a week.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.000
You wanna sit there?

19:11.041 --> 19:11.542
There?

19:11.583 --> 19:12.166
Yeah.

All right.

Oh, that's very abstract.

Well, that's a, that's a smudge
from my hand, that part.

because she's
so flexible,

21:36.250 --> 21:37.959
and she moves in
really interesting ways,

21:38.000 --> 21:39.709
you know?

21:39.750 --> 21:42.083
So what do you do
with that now?

21:42.125 --> 21:43.667
Oh, pfft! Nothing.

21:43.709 --> 21:46.417
It's just an exercise.

21:46.458 --> 21:48.834
You mind if I
keep that?

21:51.792 --> 21:52.291
Thanks.

21:52.333 --> 21:53.333
Yeah.

22:01.208 --> 22:04.750
You know, you really should've
gone to art school.

22:04.792 --> 22:06.792
What is this,
a mid-life crisis

22:06.834 --> 22:08.667
or something?

22:08.709 --> 22:09.667
Do you have cancer?

22:09.709 --> 22:10.709
No, no. No-no.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.083
Well, then what?

22:12.125 --> 22:14.542
Art school? That's
what I should do?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.417
I thought it was commerce
or... Pre-med

22:17.458 --> 22:19.125
or I'm "on my own."

22:19.166 --> 22:20.792
I said that?

22:21.917 --> 22:22.917
Ah.

22:25.667 --> 22:28.583
Well, I wish I hadn't.

22:28.625 --> 22:32.500
I mean... I know that
doesn't really help.

22:32.542 --> 22:34.542
It helps a little.

22:48.834 --> 22:49.834
Well...

22:52.542 --> 22:56.083
I had a really nice
time today, Sarah.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.875
Yeah, me too.

22:58.792 --> 22:59.792
Good.

23:03.333 --> 23:05.125
Take care of yourself.

23:07.041 --> 23:08.834
Bye, dad.

23:13.500 --> 23:18.041
Hey, I already know where
I'm going to hang this.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.041
Dad?

23:33.083 --> 23:34.083
Yeah.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.625
What, Sarah?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.125
What is it?

23:43.208 --> 23:45.709
I don't think I
wanna go.

23:51.417 --> 23:53.250
(arguing quietly)

23:57.542 --> 23:59.500
(tires skid lightly)

23:59.542 --> 24:01.542
Hey, what is this?

24:03.208 --> 24:04.667
What're you trying
to do here?

24:04.709 --> 24:07.458
I just came to say hello,
no need to get testy.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.959
You and I both know I cannot
change Sarah's path.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.208
I can't influence her to make
a different decision.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.709
I can't this,
I can't that.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.208
It's all about you,
isn't it?

24:15.250 --> 24:15.875
What?

24:15.917 --> 24:16.959
Wonder why that is?

24:17.000 --> 24:18.458
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.959
Where's Sarah in
this equation, Tom?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.709
You're not making
the choice, she is.

24:21.750 --> 24:24.250
Come on, that is pure
semantics and you know it.

24:24.291 --> 24:26.291
The only reason that
she's changing her mind

24:26.333 --> 24:27.792
is because
I'm a different person.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.291
So you know what?
Actually, yes,

24:29.333 --> 24:32.542
it has everything
to do with me.

24:33.208 --> 24:35.458
Hey, dad,
what's going on?

24:35.500 --> 24:37.000
Nothing.

24:37.041 --> 24:39.458
Oh, I was just describing
to the officer

24:39.500 --> 24:41.333
about my wallet,
my lost wallet.

24:41.375 --> 24:42.333
So, thank you,
officer.

24:42.375 --> 24:43.583
Hmm. Well,
we'll be sure

24:43.625 --> 24:45.625
to put every resource
we have on this,

24:45.667 --> 24:46.625
just for you.

24:46.667 --> 24:47.667
Let's go.

24:52.667 --> 24:54.500
(truck rumbles past)

24:59.208 --> 25:00.583
Marjorie?

25:04.333 --> 25:05.333
(clock chimes)

25:06.458 --> 25:07.959
I'm gonna go
have a shower.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Okay.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.583
Uh, Sarah?

25:14.625 --> 25:16.333
What should I make us
for dinner?

25:16.375 --> 25:18.375
Don't you mean,
what can you order in?

25:18.417 --> 25:19.625
No, I cook.

25:19.667 --> 25:21.542
Sometimes I cook.

25:21.583 --> 25:25.083
Yeah, I'd wait for mom
if I were you.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.583
Wow, look at you.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.166
Yeah, please don't.

25:38.208 --> 25:41.000
I look like I walked off
the set of "7th heaven"

25:41.041 --> 25:42.291
or something.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.500
I hope you don't mind,
I put my clothes in the wash

25:44.542 --> 25:47.750
and since everything else
I own is in martin's van...

25:47.792 --> 25:49.792
It's totally fine.

25:51.667 --> 25:52.625
What's that?

25:52.667 --> 25:55.458
This is fettucini bolognese.

26:00.667 --> 26:01.500
Wow. Props, dad.

26:01.542 --> 26:02.125
(chuckles)

26:02.166 --> 26:03.417
Thanks.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.333
Marjorie: Hello?

26:05.375 --> 26:06.750
Tom?

26:06.792 --> 26:09.709
Yeah, we're in
the kitchen.

26:14.375 --> 26:15.458
Sarah.

26:15.500 --> 26:16.875
Hey, mom.

26:16.917 --> 26:20.458
Um, dad said it'd be okay
if I came home with him.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.917
Of course it's okay,
if you're here to stay.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.959
Sarah's here for dinner,
which, uh...

26:27.000 --> 26:29.583
Is actually going to be ready
momentarily, so.

26:31.458 --> 26:32.917
So what was it this time?

26:32.959 --> 26:34.166
Did you run outta money?

26:34.208 --> 26:36.208
Or did you have another
fight with Martin?

26:36.250 --> 26:37.709
Yeah, it was a
big mistake,

26:37.750 --> 26:39.208
I really shouldn't
have come here.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.250
Dr. Tom:
Sarah, wait.

26:40.291 --> 26:41.000
One of many.

26:41.041 --> 26:41.750
Marjorie, please.

26:41.792 --> 26:42.333
What?

26:42.375 --> 26:43.000
She's here.

26:43.041 --> 26:44.500
That's a good thing.

26:44.542 --> 26:47.458
it is, but I think I have a
right to know why she's here

26:47.500 --> 26:49.208
and if she's gonna
stay this time.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.709
Just drop...

26:55.291 --> 26:56.834
(clears throat)

26:56.875 --> 26:59.625
ah, could you, um, set
the dining room table

26:59.667 --> 27:00.750
for us, please?

27:04.083 --> 27:05.291
I cannot believe you!

27:05.333 --> 27:06.458
Shhh, I know.
Shhh...

27:06.500 --> 27:08.542
I thought we agreed
we'd be a united front.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.500
Yeah... Listen, I spent
the day with her today.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.500
And I really believe

27:12.542 --> 27:16.750
that we all have
an opportunity here.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.709
And, Marjorie, I don't want
to drive her away again.

27:19.750 --> 27:22.083
We have been down
this road before

27:22.125 --> 27:24.542
every time we fail.

27:24.583 --> 27:26.583
Yeah, all of us.

27:26.625 --> 27:30.625
But let's... Can we just
have some dinner?

27:30.667 --> 27:32.208
As a family?

27:38.250 --> 27:41.291
Pasta's not overcooked,
I hope?

27:41.333 --> 27:43.000
It's really good.

27:43.041 --> 27:45.166
So, have you, um...

27:45.208 --> 27:47.875
Have thought about your plans
now that you're home?

27:47.917 --> 27:48.917
No.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.375
Well, I'm here,

27:50.417 --> 27:52.125
if you want help
with your resume.

27:52.166 --> 27:56.083
Or if you decide you wanna
apply to university again.

27:56.125 --> 27:58.000
Well, I just got back
an hour ago.

27:58.041 --> 27:58.583
(half laughs)

27:58.625 --> 28:00.917
Of course.

28:00.959 --> 28:02.709
Um, we can think ahead.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.166
She is, actually.

28:04.208 --> 28:08.041
Sarah tells me that
she wants to pursue art.

28:08.083 --> 28:11.291
Yeah, maybe even,
um, art school.

28:11.333 --> 28:13.041
Well, that could be good.

28:13.083 --> 28:14.875
You've always liked art.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.875
So you'd study
graphic design,

28:16.917 --> 28:18.834
that sort of thing?

28:18.875 --> 28:21.291
Uh, maybe a bit,
but...

28:22.291 --> 28:23.333
Yeah, uh...

28:23.375 --> 28:25.333
I think that what
Sarah wants to do

28:25.375 --> 28:27.458
is to be an artist.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.709
You know, the, uh...

28:30.750 --> 28:32.417
And the thing is,
she's good.

28:32.458 --> 28:34.667
You know, we went to her
art class today.

28:34.709 --> 28:35.667
To an art class?

28:35.709 --> 28:36.750
Dr. Tom: Yeah.

28:37.875 --> 28:39.500
Sh-she did this.

28:39.542 --> 28:41.417
Yeah, it's lovely.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.166
But drawing is... A hobby,

28:44.208 --> 28:45.375
it's not a career.

28:46.417 --> 28:47.583
Marjorie, don't.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.750
Don't why?

28:48.792 --> 28:50.041
It's true.

28:50.083 --> 28:52.417
How many artists do you know
who make a living?

28:52.458 --> 28:54.500
Who aren't forced
to waitress,

28:54.542 --> 28:55.959
or clean houses?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.375
Mom, there's more to life
than money, actually.

28:58.417 --> 29:00.625
I know that's really hard
for you to understand.

29:00.667 --> 29:01.917
Dr. Tom: Sarah.

29:01.959 --> 29:04.333
Come on, Tom, you
agree with me.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.083
I don't, actually.

29:06.125 --> 29:07.458
It's Sarah's life.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.458
And I don't think
that shutting this down

29:09.500 --> 29:10.458
is the right thing.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.000
Really?

29:12.041 --> 29:12.750
Since when?

29:12.792 --> 29:13.667
What?

29:14.959 --> 29:17.625
Do you know what your dad
told me last night?

29:17.667 --> 29:20.208
He said it killed him,
waking up every morning,

29:20.250 --> 29:23.250
knowing that his daughter
was living on the streets,

29:23.291 --> 29:25.125
and throwing away
her whole life.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.834
Would you stop?!

29:38.041 --> 29:40.000
Why did you come
looking for me?

29:40.041 --> 29:40.583
Sarah...

29:40.625 --> 29:41.959
I was fine!

29:42.000 --> 29:44.083
I came because
I wanted to understand

29:44.125 --> 29:46.667
why this happened.

29:46.709 --> 29:49.709
This happened because
you and mom,

29:49.750 --> 29:51.750
you won't let me
live my life.

29:51.792 --> 29:53.750
You think you can make
decisions for me

29:53.792 --> 29:55.542
for the rest of my
life, forever.

29:55.583 --> 29:58.041
No, sarah, that's not true,
I want you to decide.

29:58.083 --> 30:00.250
Right. Decide to go
to art school?

30:00.291 --> 30:01.125
Yes.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.458
Yeah, so
even there,

30:02.500 --> 30:03.750
(stammers)

30:03.792 --> 30:06.625
you're taking the thing
that I love and you're...

30:06.667 --> 30:08.750
You know I'm an
adult, right?

30:08.792 --> 30:10.792
And so that means,
for the first time,

30:10.834 --> 30:14.333
finally, finally, I can make
my own decisions.

30:14.375 --> 30:15.834
You can't control me.

30:15.875 --> 30:17.417
I can do what
I want!

30:17.458 --> 30:18.917
And right now
what I want

30:18.959 --> 30:20.959
is to get the hell
out of here!

30:23.125 --> 30:25.625
(front door opens
and closes)

30:59.250 --> 31:00.291
Tom.

31:00.333 --> 31:03.125
Just, uh... Just give
me a minute.

31:07.291 --> 31:08.667
Thank you...

31:10.250 --> 31:12.500
For taking me back there.

31:12.542 --> 31:14.542
I know it was hard.

31:14.583 --> 31:16.041
Yeah, you know,
I always assumed

31:16.083 --> 31:18.792
that it was the problems
between Marjorie and I

31:18.834 --> 31:22.250
that were to blame for what
happened with Sarah.

31:22.291 --> 31:23.875
And now?

31:23.917 --> 31:28.583
Well, now I know it was
more complicated than that.

31:30.542 --> 31:32.208
We were scared.

31:33.250 --> 31:36.000
We thought she was just
messing around, you know?

31:36.041 --> 31:38.875
We thought she just didn't
wanna grow up.

31:38.917 --> 31:41.875
When, in fact, that's exactly
what she was trying to do.

31:41.917 --> 31:44.375
she accused you of wanting
to make decisions for her,

31:44.417 --> 31:46.125
forever.

31:46.166 --> 31:49.208
Is that what I'm doing
with Erica?

31:49.250 --> 31:51.166
Making her decisions
for her?

31:51.208 --> 31:52.959
What do you think?

31:53.000 --> 31:55.792
You can't deny the fact
that Kai...

31:55.834 --> 31:57.875
He has become a
distraction.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.125
Dr. Naadiah:
Maybe he has.

31:59.166 --> 32:00.625
But why does that
preclude him

32:00.667 --> 32:02.834
from being a necessary part
of Erica's journey?

32:02.875 --> 32:05.667
Especially if she
wants him to be?

32:15.625 --> 32:19.041
How did you know when,
when I was ready?

32:19.750 --> 32:21.875
You knew.

32:21.917 --> 32:23.166
And you let me know.

32:26.208 --> 32:27.208
Thank you.

32:31.709 --> 32:32.709
(exhales)

32:33.834 --> 32:35.250
(low hum of traffic)

32:37.750 --> 32:38.750
(car whooshes by)

32:43.208 --> 32:44.208
Fred?

32:46.667 --> 32:47.625
Hey.

32:47.667 --> 32:48.667
Cheers.

32:50.959 --> 32:55.333
So, what do they do to doctors
who crash and burn?

32:55.375 --> 32:58.291
Same thing they do
to doctors who quit.

32:58.333 --> 32:59.500
I heard about that.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.834
Yeah.

33:00.875 --> 33:03.375
Uh, not my finest moment.

33:04.375 --> 33:05.542
Mmm.

33:07.375 --> 33:10.417
You know, this thing
that we do,

33:10.458 --> 33:12.291
it's not easy.

33:12.333 --> 33:13.750
No kidding.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.709
I can't reach him.

33:16.750 --> 33:19.834
I've tried everything
I can think of.

33:19.875 --> 33:23.000
Sometimes you need
a little help.

33:23.041 --> 33:24.041
I did.

33:24.834 --> 33:27.041
Yeah, well,
no one's offered.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.834
Well, consider this
an offer.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.750
Hey, I'm not saying
it's gonna change anything,

33:32.792 --> 33:34.417
but if you wanted me to,

33:34.458 --> 33:36.458
I'd be happy
to give it a try.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.000
Be my guest.

33:39.041 --> 33:41.500
I'm not sure if Kai
will let you be his,

33:41.542 --> 33:44.125
but you might
as well try.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.166
(plays guitar)

33:56.208 --> 33:57.208
(knocking)

34:01.458 --> 34:02.458
(plays guitar)

34:03.458 --> 34:04.417
(knocking)

34:05.250 --> 34:07.291
hold on a second!

34:07.333 --> 34:08.375
(knocking)

34:08.417 --> 34:09.917
hold on a second!

34:11.417 --> 34:12.917
Yeah, what?

34:14.417 --> 34:15.417
It's funny,

34:15.458 --> 34:18.083
I think was expecting
someone more...

34:18.125 --> 34:19.083
Charming.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.375
You know,
for a rock star.

34:21.417 --> 34:22.375
May I come in?

34:22.417 --> 34:23.834
Who are you?

34:23.875 --> 34:26.542
Dr. Tom, Erica's
therapist.

34:28.959 --> 34:29.959
Thanks.

34:32.125 --> 34:34.375
So, what, are you
tag-teaming me now?

34:34.417 --> 34:35.417
Unh?

34:37.083 --> 34:38.792
So, Dr. Fred sent
you in here

34:38.834 --> 34:41.041
to talk me back
on the straight and narrow,

34:41.083 --> 34:42.834
convince me
I'm destroying my life?

34:42.875 --> 34:45.375
(inhales and exhales)

34:45.417 --> 34:48.375
Erica ever mention to you
that she had a brother?

34:48.417 --> 34:49.625
No.

34:49.667 --> 34:54.458
Well, he died 10 years ago
in a tragic accident,

34:54.500 --> 34:58.458
one that Erica tried
to go back and prevent

34:58.500 --> 35:02.375
by twisting this therapy
into something that it's not.

35:02.417 --> 35:04.000
Did it work?

35:04.041 --> 35:06.041
What do you think?

35:10.166 --> 35:13.250
So... Well, explain
to me, Kai,

35:14.625 --> 35:17.917
what is it that you
want, exactly?

35:17.959 --> 35:19.291
To disappear.

35:19.333 --> 35:21.083
Why?

35:21.125 --> 35:22.333
I mean, what is it

35:22.375 --> 35:23.834
that you figure
that's gonna do?

35:23.875 --> 35:25.583
It's gonna make things
better for everybody,

35:25.625 --> 35:27.000
including me.

35:28.417 --> 35:31.250
Well, it seems to me you've
tried that already though,

35:31.291 --> 35:32.333
haven't you?

35:32.375 --> 35:34.500
I mean, you ran away
from your whole life

35:34.542 --> 35:36.750
and yet,
here you are again...

35:37.750 --> 35:39.375
Running.

35:39.417 --> 35:42.250
Um, I'm just wondering
where it ends?

35:42.291 --> 35:45.500
It ends with Travis
still alive.

35:46.625 --> 35:47.625
You know, Kai,

35:47.667 --> 35:50.375
just because you want
that to happen,

35:50.417 --> 35:51.834
doesn't mean
that it will.

35:54.291 --> 35:55.750
You know, that might
be something

35:55.792 --> 35:57.542
you need to face.

35:57.583 --> 35:58.375
Are we done?

35:58.417 --> 35:59.417
No.

36:01.667 --> 36:04.583
No, uh... One more thing:

36:04.625 --> 36:06.375
be sure, kai.

36:06.417 --> 36:07.917
Before you make any
big changes,

36:07.959 --> 36:11.625
before you start messing around
with your past,

36:11.667 --> 36:16.750
be sure that you're making
the right choices this time.

36:20.041 --> 36:22.166
"Act the way
you'd like to be

36:22.208 --> 36:25.667
and soon you'll be
the way you act."

36:25.709 --> 36:26.709
Bob Dylan.

36:36.917 --> 36:39.417
You know, Alexis,
she may know a lot about sex,

36:39.458 --> 36:41.959
but she sure doesn't know
how to use the apostrophe.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.458
Well, that's why
we pay you

36:43.500 --> 36:44.917
the medium-sized bucks,
chicken.

36:44.959 --> 36:47.208
Dori swears by this new
raw food place.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.250
That being said,
raw food plus Dori

36:49.291 --> 36:51.000
equals a bathroom break
every 20 minutes.

36:51.041 --> 36:52.291
(laughs)

36:52.333 --> 36:54.125
Hey, maybe Erica can think
of someplace we can go.

36:54.166 --> 36:55.625
Actually...

36:55.667 --> 36:57.250
I feel like Italian.

36:57.291 --> 37:00.041
Carb cleansing's so 2005.

37:02.375 --> 37:04.291
Ouch.

37:04.333 --> 37:05.625
I can't believe that...

37:05.667 --> 37:08.166
I actually thought that
I was friends with him.

37:08.208 --> 37:10.625
Yeah, I kinda figured out
he couldn't be trusted

37:10.667 --> 37:12.125
when I found his
nail file

37:12.166 --> 37:13.834
sticking straight out
of my back.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.959
Erica, it's awful,
I know,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.458
but it is what it is.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.458
Maybe if I could
just talk to him

37:21.500 --> 37:22.625
away from here...

37:22.667 --> 37:24.500
Or maybe you just need
to accept the fact

37:24.542 --> 37:26.792
that your friendship
has changed.

37:26.834 --> 37:28.500
Probably for good.

37:29.500 --> 37:30.542
Here it is.

37:30.583 --> 37:31.583
Thanks.

37:34.417 --> 37:35.417
(exhales)

37:39.875 --> 37:42.083
Dr. Tom: Hey,
so, uh...

37:42.125 --> 37:43.125
How is this?

37:44.333 --> 37:47.083
It's a little high on
the left, you think?

37:47.125 --> 37:48.583
Maybe you didn't
get the message

37:48.625 --> 37:50.542
when I walked out
of here yesterday.

37:50.583 --> 37:53.375
No, I got it loud
and clear.

37:54.583 --> 37:58.333
Erica, you were right
to be upset.

37:58.375 --> 37:59.166
Really?

37:59.208 --> 38:00.333
Dr. Tom:
Yeah.

38:00.375 --> 38:02.542
And also, to answer
your question:

38:02.583 --> 38:06.166
when are you allowed to decide
what we talk about?

38:06.208 --> 38:08.000
When you're ready,

38:08.041 --> 38:10.792
and apparently that's now.

38:11.792 --> 38:12.917
So...

38:12.959 --> 38:14.291
(exhales)

38:14.333 --> 38:16.250
let's talk about Kai.

38:16.291 --> 38:17.291
Okay.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.333
(door closes)

38:21.166 --> 38:22.625
okay, what's the catch?

38:22.667 --> 38:23.667
No catch.

38:24.625 --> 38:26.250
Sit. Please.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.000
Well, he...

38:33.500 --> 38:35.917
He is withdrawing
from everything

38:35.959 --> 38:39.208
and I feel like
it's my fault.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.458
Why? Because
you told him

38:40.500 --> 38:42.333
that you felt
something for him?

38:42.375 --> 38:43.834
And he thinks that
changes everything

38:43.875 --> 38:45.583
and I told him
it doesn't to,

38:45.625 --> 38:47.208
but he...
He doesn't listen.

38:47.250 --> 38:48.834
And you think
that he's wrong;

38:48.875 --> 38:50.166
that after your confession,

38:50.208 --> 38:52.834
that you can continue
to be just friends.

38:52.875 --> 38:54.000
Yes.

38:54.041 --> 38:56.125
Because I made it
very clear to him that...

38:56.166 --> 38:57.875
That you're not breaking up
with Ethan.

38:57.917 --> 38:59.917
Right. I know.

39:01.041 --> 39:02.417
(half laughs)

39:02.458 --> 39:03.500
What?

39:03.542 --> 39:05.208
It's funny.

39:06.208 --> 39:08.083
You know, a year ago,

39:08.125 --> 39:09.875
you and I couldn't have
this conversation.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.917
You know, I would have
shut it down and, uh...

39:13.959 --> 39:15.542
You would have dropped it.

39:15.583 --> 39:17.333
You would've done
as you were told.

39:17.375 --> 39:18.375
(laughs)

39:19.625 --> 39:20.583
Yeah.

39:20.625 --> 39:23.458
Things are different now -

39:23.500 --> 39:25.291
you're different -

39:26.458 --> 39:28.208
and that's a sign.

39:28.250 --> 39:29.542
A sign of what?

39:29.583 --> 39:30.583
Change.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.709
You know, in here,

39:33.750 --> 39:37.542
one gets the feeling
that time stands still.

39:37.583 --> 39:40.041
Of course it does,
in a way,

39:40.083 --> 39:42.083
but, uh... You and I,

39:43.083 --> 39:46.834
our, uh, patient-therapist
relationship,

39:46.875 --> 39:48.375
it's, uh...

39:49.750 --> 39:51.792
It's evolving.

39:51.834 --> 39:52.917
Mm. It is.

39:54.333 --> 39:57.125
What is it that they say?
Change or die.

39:58.417 --> 40:00.875
Well, you know, that's...

40:00.917 --> 40:03.208
That's the same
for relationships, too.

40:03.250 --> 40:05.458
You know, if we don't
allow them to change,

40:05.500 --> 40:08.667
then we run the risk
of destroying them.

40:08.709 --> 40:11.542
So, I think
the question here is,

40:11.583 --> 40:14.625
can you accept that
your relationship with Kai

40:14.667 --> 40:15.959
is changing?

40:16.875 --> 40:19.834
I have a crush on a damaged
rock star from the future.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.583
I'm not gonna...

40:21.625 --> 40:23.625
Throw away everything
that I have for that.

40:25.792 --> 40:27.333
For nothing.

40:28.458 --> 40:30.291
I'm not stupid.

40:30.333 --> 40:33.417
Well, then there's
your answer.

40:34.333 --> 40:35.333
Right?

40:38.166 --> 40:39.166
(exhales)

40:41.333 --> 40:42.709
Yeah.

40:47.750 --> 40:50.291
(exhales
and clears throat)

40:50.333 --> 40:51.667
It's beautiful.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.583
It's very raw,

40:55.250 --> 40:57.166
in a good way.

40:57.208 --> 40:58.583
Yeah, it is.

41:07.625 --> 41:09.375
(door closes)

41:15.375 --> 41:18.250
Erica: change is
inevitable.

41:18.291 --> 41:21.667
The only constant
is that nothing is constant,

41:21.709 --> 41:22.917
and our best defence

41:22.959 --> 41:24.750
is to change
how we deal with it.

41:24.792 --> 41:28.041
I'm just here
for a decaf vanilla latte.

41:29.041 --> 41:30.583
Or... Not?

41:30.625 --> 41:31.333
He's here.

41:31.375 --> 41:31.875
Kai?

41:31.917 --> 41:32.917
Yes.

41:32.959 --> 41:34.166
Hey.

41:34.208 --> 41:35.875
Hey. Hi.

41:35.917 --> 41:37.375
So, you're just here

41:37.417 --> 41:38.792
picking up
your last paycheck?

41:38.834 --> 41:40.917
No, more like begging
for my job back.

41:40.959 --> 41:42.667
Yup.

41:42.709 --> 41:44.542
Wow, that's...
That's a surprise.

41:44.583 --> 41:45.792
I thought you'd be happy.

41:45.834 --> 41:48.959
No, i, of course I am,
but... What changed?

41:49.000 --> 41:50.709
Your doc,
he paid me a visit.

41:50.750 --> 41:52.166
We had an interesting
conversation.

41:52.208 --> 41:54.458
Wait, I'm sorry. Dr. Tom,
he spoke with you?

41:54.500 --> 41:56.709
Yeah, I thought he did it
'cause of you.

41:56.750 --> 41:59.917
No, no. I asked
him to, but...

41:59.959 --> 42:01.750
But he said no.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.625
Well, I guess
he changed his mind.

42:03.667 --> 42:05.667
Yeah, I guess he did.

42:05.709 --> 42:06.875
Anyway,

42:06.917 --> 42:10.041
some of things he said
made me reconsider.

42:10.083 --> 42:11.083
Really?

42:11.125 --> 42:12.625
I think I'll stick
around a while,

42:12.667 --> 42:14.166
do some thinking.

42:14.208 --> 42:16.750
Decide what I
wanna do next.

42:16.792 --> 42:18.792
Last thing I need
is another regret, right?

42:20.083 --> 42:21.083
Right.

42:22.542 --> 42:24.709
Listen, Kai,
about the...

42:24.750 --> 42:26.041
I mean,
about this situation

42:26.083 --> 42:29.375
and what you said about us
not talking to each other.

42:29.417 --> 42:31.959
Yeah, I'm sorry,
I was overreacting.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.417
No, I think that
you were right.

42:34.458 --> 42:37.542
I really need to
focus on Ethan

42:37.583 --> 42:39.500
and me right now.

42:40.583 --> 42:43.166
Oh, no, of course,
I get it.

42:43.208 --> 42:45.792
You gotta do
what feels right.

42:45.834 --> 42:46.834
Okay.

42:47.917 --> 42:48.917
Thanks.

42:51.375 --> 42:54.208
So, we'll still see you for
your morning coffee?
