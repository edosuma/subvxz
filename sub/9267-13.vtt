‐ WELL, THE THING IS, SIR,
WE DON'T ACTUALLY

09:26.399 --> 09:27.233
NEED YOUR PERMISSION.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.902

MY PERMISSION.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.570

10:23.331 --> 10:24.791
AND HE ASKED FOR JULIE'S HAND

10:24.833 --> 10:26.626
HE ASKED ME FOR HER HAND
IN MARRIAGE.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.294
‐ AT LEAST HE HAD THE DECENCY
TO COME TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.963
‐ NO, HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY DECENCY
TO COME TALK TO ME,

10:29.963 --> 10:30.839
'CAUSE HE ALREADY TALKED
TO HER.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.215

10:44.686 --> 10:46.771
THIS IS GONNA BE FANTASTIC."

10:46.813 --> 10:49.399

14:40.546 --> 14:43.216
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE GETTING

‐ MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING, MATT.

15:06.030 --> 15:11.327
MARRIAGE REQUIRES MATURITY.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.455
MARRIAGE REQUIRES
TWO PEOPLE,

TO EACH OTHER.

15:23.256 --> 15:27.260
AND THAT MARRIAGE REQUIRES

AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.400
TONIGHT, YOU GO HOME,

42:49.442 --> 42:51.027
YOU GET YOUR STUDIES DONE,

42:51.069 --> 42:52.904
YOU GET YOUR REST,
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE BACK

42:52.904 --> 42:54.572
HERE TOMORROW AT 6:00 A. M.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.741
THAT MEANS NO LATER THAN 5:45.

42:56.783 --> 42:59.410
UNDERSTOOD?
all: YES, SIR!

42:59.452 --> 43:02.580
‐ CLEAR EYES.
FULL HEARTS.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.543
AH, WE'LL DEAL
WITH THAT LATER.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.587
GRAB A LAP.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.506
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
GOOD WORK TODAY.

43:11.547 --> 43:14.550
[indistinct chatter]

43:37.573 --> 43:42.120
‐ YOU READY TO GO HOME?

43:42.120 --> 44:52.982
‐ YEAH, LET'S GO.
