01:20.696 --> 01:22.630
Alex.

01:25.067 --> 01:27.923
- What?
- I need to go.

01:28.003 --> 01:30.259
- So?
- Can I come with you?

01:30.339 --> 01:32.967
Hurry up.

01:50.092 --> 01:53.186
Stay with me, please.

02:02.938 --> 02:05.031
- Doesn't work?
- As usual.

02:11.380 --> 02:13.435
It's the others, you know.

02:13.515 --> 02:16.538
They like to play with the taps.

02:16.618 --> 02:19.108
- Who?
- The other children.

02:19.188 --> 02:21.410
What do you mean?
Who are you talking about?

02:21.490 --> 02:23.679
You know, the scary children.

02:23.759 --> 02:27.082
- That's make-believe.
- No, it's true.

02:27.162 --> 02:29.084
- So you've seen them?
- Hmm.

02:29.164 --> 02:31.530
So there.

03:02.331 --> 03:05.421
- Wait.
- Where are you going?

03:05.501 --> 03:08.595
I'll be right back.

04:37.459 --> 04:40.019
Alex.

04:49.538 --> 04:51.802
Alex?

04:55.477 --> 04:57.707
Alex?

05:06.722 --> 05:08.781
Alex?

09:09.264 --> 09:12.454
- Everything going properly, mademoiselle?
- Yes, Madame.

09:12.534 --> 09:16.525
Madame Francard. I'll be needing you.

09:16.605 --> 09:19.039
Since when don't you?

09:25.046 --> 09:27.446
Second door on the right.
You'll find everything you need.

10:14.262 --> 10:17.519
You don't have to
put that on straight away.

10:17.599 --> 10:20.864
Oh, she doesn't miss a trick
old mother Francard.

10:21.870 --> 10:24.826
- My name, you saw on the cupboard.
- Helenka?

10:24.906 --> 10:27.729
I do the cooking around here
and the cleaning also.

10:27.809 --> 10:31.800
- Rest your heart. You won't be alone.
- Ah.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.202
You are a pretty one, aren't you?

10:34.282 --> 10:36.371
Have you worked here long, ma'am?

10:36.451 --> 10:40.308
No need to "ma'am" me, or curtsy either.

10:40.388 --> 10:44.012
This has been my home for 23 years.

10:44.092 --> 10:46.014
It isn't exactly a picnic.

10:46.094 --> 10:48.984
But it's no worse than anywhere else.

10:49.064 --> 10:54.856
And the fresh mountain air
is an extra added bonus.

10:54.936 --> 11:00.562
And you? How did a pretty, young girl
as yourself end up here?

11:00.642 --> 11:02.564
If I had a smile such as yours,

11:02.644 --> 11:05.613
I would have played my cards differently.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.824
Are you going to stay
here all by yourself?

11:31.840 --> 11:34.296
You send some little housemate
that I did not choose,

11:34.376 --> 11:36.698
and I'm supposed to hand her
the keys to the place?

11:36.778 --> 11:40.602
This young woman had trouble
with the people she used to work for.

11:40.682 --> 11:42.048
Serious trouble.

11:42.148 --> 11:46.469
The job at Saint Ange is a chance for her
to start over. And she's very competent.

11:46.569 --> 11:50.312
What do you know about house staff,
gentlemen, hmm? I ask you.

11:50.392 --> 11:53.848
Madame, Saint Ange is closing
whether you like it or not.

11:53.928 --> 11:55.917
Or would you prefer
that another child die here?

11:55.997 --> 11:59.854
I would've preferred the funds to bring
Saint Ange back up to standard.

11:59.934 --> 12:02.456
It would've avoided a lot of misery.

12:02.536 --> 12:04.029
Madame Francard...

12:28.997 --> 12:32.087
She came to fetch you at the bus stop?

12:32.167 --> 12:36.057
She insisted upon it
to show she's still the boss.

12:36.137 --> 12:38.293
She's like that.

12:38.373 --> 12:41.774
Come.

12:42.343 --> 12:45.133
This is the service hallway.

12:45.213 --> 12:49.471
Boys' dormitories are on
the other side of the main stairs.

12:49.551 --> 12:53.510
The girls' dorm is upstairs.
The rest is more or less closed off.

12:54.588 --> 12:55.810
More or less?

12:55.890 --> 12:59.414
Some parts are so rotten,
they're not safe.

12:59.494 --> 13:04.488
Humidity, leaks.
Saint Ange's fatal wounds.

13:12.273 --> 13:14.207
Your room.

13:24.285 --> 13:26.641
My dear children,

13:26.721 --> 13:29.656
today should be a day of celebration.

13:31.493 --> 13:35.383
You will be leaving this home
that saw you grow up...

13:35.463 --> 13:40.655
with the love of God
and the respect of his holy word.

13:40.735 --> 13:43.892
You have been raised and cherished...

13:43.972 --> 13:47.128
according to the rules of the holy gospel.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.964
And the education
that you have received here...

13:50.044 --> 13:53.168
will guide you in the outside world...

13:53.248 --> 13:55.842
through your most difficult moments.

14:01.089 --> 14:05.480
Never forget,
in the new life that a waits you...

14:05.560 --> 14:08.654
the lessons that
you have learned at Saint Ange.

14:09.731 --> 14:13.088
And please keep,
each and every one of you...

14:13.168 --> 14:16.091
in a small corner of your heart...

14:16.171 --> 14:19.402
the memory of the happy times
that we have had here.

14:20.575 --> 14:23.064
I know that you will strive...

14:23.144 --> 14:26.267
among your new adopted families...

14:26.347 --> 14:29.738
to be deserving of the love
that will be granted to you.

14:29.818 --> 14:32.240
And that throughout your lives...

14:32.320 --> 14:34.809
as men and women...

14:34.889 --> 14:38.950
you will always honor Saint Ange.

16:32.707 --> 16:34.868
Helenka?

18:46.441 --> 18:48.807
Helenka?

19:17.772 --> 19:20.002
Come in.

19:30.751 --> 19:32.742
You have come to visit me?

19:33.754 --> 19:37.417
That's good. The music was for you.

19:41.095 --> 19:43.017
You have reached paradise.

19:43.097 --> 19:45.429
Saint Ange is children's paradise.

19:46.501 --> 19:48.823
Really?

19:48.903 --> 19:51.559
I saw you with the children.

19:51.639 --> 19:54.128
They like you.

19:54.208 --> 19:57.231
We'll make the house shine
for when they return.

19:57.311 --> 19:59.711
They'll be back sooner or later.

20:04.051 --> 20:06.107
They turned off the water.

20:06.187 --> 20:08.382
They wanted me to change rooms,
but I don't think so.

20:12.059 --> 20:14.315
How long have you been here?

20:14.395 --> 20:16.329
I've always been here.

20:18.466 --> 20:20.400
How old are you?

20:21.702 --> 20:23.624
Stop it.

20:23.704 --> 20:26.127
You ask me like that,
but in fact you're really dying to know.

20:26.207 --> 20:28.129
Just like the others.

20:28.209 --> 20:32.233
But not the children.
They don't care how old I am.

20:32.313 --> 20:34.679
Go away.

20:36.884 --> 20:38.818
I'm sorry.

20:40.788 --> 20:43.077
You don't understand.

20:43.157 --> 20:45.250
You're always judging.

20:48.896 --> 20:51.296
- I'm very sorry.
- Go away!

20:59.840 --> 21:02.163
You have just met Judith.

21:02.243 --> 21:04.899
She just gave you her special welcoming.

21:04.979 --> 21:06.968
- She's completely...
- Hopeless.

21:07.048 --> 21:09.949
You see why she's still here?

21:15.923 --> 21:18.057
I think she's been watching me.

21:18.525 --> 21:20.748
Judith? Typical.

21:20.828 --> 21:24.051
As nosy as a spy.

21:24.131 --> 21:26.053
How old is she?

21:26.133 --> 21:28.122
What do you think?

21:28.202 --> 21:30.424
She speaks like an adult...

21:30.504 --> 21:34.595
until you realize
she's spinning perfect nonsense.

21:34.675 --> 21:38.266
- How odd.
- Ah, you'll get used to it.

21:38.346 --> 21:40.101
What will become of her?

21:40.181 --> 21:44.671
She's gotten it into her little head
that I'll be taking her with me.

21:44.751 --> 21:48.509
I can be a softy,
but I can see her coming.

21:48.589 --> 21:51.145
Can you imagine the troubles?

21:51.225 --> 21:55.027
I swiped it out of the store room.
Bet Francard never used it once.

21:55.896 --> 21:58.293
Here, Judith.

22:02.937 --> 22:04.492
Uh, yuck.

22:04.572 --> 22:08.133
- Music, music, music.
- Oh, yes, yes, of course. Music.

22:22.123 --> 22:26.116
Forgive me. Forgive me.

22:54.555 --> 22:59.013
I'm in the mood for love

22:59.093 --> 23:03.551
Simply because you're near me

23:03.631 --> 23:06.623
Funny, but when you're near me

23:07.835 --> 23:10.633
I'm in the mood for love

23:12.306 --> 23:16.230
Heaven is in your eyes

23:16.310 --> 23:21.102
Bright as the stars we're under

23:21.182 --> 23:24.447
Oh, is it any wonder

23:25.753 --> 23:29.314
I'm in the mood for love

23:30.324 --> 23:33.384
# Why stop to think of whether #

23:34.395 --> 23:38.619
# This little dream might pay #

23:38.699 --> 23:42.328
# We've put our hearts together #

23:43.337 --> 23:46.127
# Now we are one #

23:46.207 --> 23:48.396
# I'm not afraid #

23:48.476 --> 23:52.433
# If there's a cloud above #

23:52.513 --> 23:56.504
# If it should rain, we'll let it #

23:56.584 --> 24:00.111
# But for tonight, forget it #

24:01.322 --> 24:04.780
# I'm in the mood for love #

24:44.064 --> 24:46.123
Hey.

24:58.245 --> 25:01.476
Good. Come on.

27:14.081 --> 27:17.037
- Sleep well?
- Sort of.

27:17.117 --> 27:19.707
- Bad dreams?
- How did you know?

27:19.787 --> 27:23.022
It's a big house.
You'll find you'll get used to it.

27:23.533 --> 27:27.948
Oh, there's Daniel. He's early.
Would you like anything?

27:28.028 --> 27:30.084
You'll manage then?

27:30.164 --> 27:32.486
We won't be home late.

27:32.566 --> 27:34.522
This morning I'll do
the floors in the entrance.

27:34.602 --> 27:39.062
Do what you please.
Madame the boss is off skiing.

31:05.946 --> 31:08.380
Watch out for the scary children.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.050
Hold her. Hold her. Oh, my God. Hold her.

31:57.130 --> 32:01.588
Oh, my God. Hold her, Judith.
Calm down. Calm down.

32:01.668 --> 32:04.796
Hold her, Judith. Hold her.

32:06.572 --> 32:09.975
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna. Calm down, Anna.

32:10.075 --> 32:13.901
Anna, Anna, Anna. Everything is fine.
Everything is fine.

32:13.981 --> 32:18.572
Everything is fine.
Calm down. Calm down, dear.

32:18.652 --> 32:21.608
Calm down. Yes. Good girl.

32:21.688 --> 32:25.145
Calm down. Shh.

32:25.225 --> 32:27.159
Calm down, calm down.

32:29.262 --> 32:31.518
Oh, shh.

32:31.598 --> 32:36.123
Hold still, my dear. I'm almost through.

32:36.203 --> 32:37.966
One more stitch.

32:40.507 --> 32:43.297
Don't move, don't move.
Don't move, don't move.

32:43.377 --> 32:46.767
When he'll arrive,
we'll have a party with music.

32:46.847 --> 32:49.136
Stop.

32:49.216 --> 32:51.878
- Why?
- "Stop," I said.

32:57.024 --> 32:58.992
That will do.

33:35.829 --> 33:39.890
Oh, my God. What did they do to you?

33:43.437 --> 33:47.094
They did this to you,
the bastards you were working for?

33:47.174 --> 33:49.596
Don't tell anyone.

33:49.676 --> 33:51.610
Ever.

34:16.803 --> 34:19.726
Cry, little one.

34:19.806 --> 34:21.475
Cry.

34:24.378 --> 34:28.178
Cry, cry, cry.

39:10.597 --> 39:14.020
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.897
Just rummaging.

39:17.570 --> 39:20.860
You'll find nothing but rats here...

39:20.940 --> 39:23.129
and a few memories...

39:23.209 --> 39:25.803
which are hardly any of your business.

39:27.814 --> 39:31.638
- You got back last night?
- Don't worry. I'm not staying.

39:31.718 --> 39:33.740
Just collecting a few
personal belongings...

39:33.820 --> 39:35.788
if you don't mind.

39:38.792 --> 39:40.885
Raking up the past, eh?

39:42.162 --> 39:45.131
They brought us more
than a few of the earth's damned.

39:50.270 --> 39:54.138
Poor lambs. Dozens each week.

39:57.277 --> 40:00.533
- Children?
- Crouched at the back.

40:00.613 --> 40:03.236
Dumb as mutes.

40:03.316 --> 40:06.507
So lost, even the babes
couldn't find the breath to cry.

40:07.169 --> 40:11.162
Five years of war. We made it through.

40:26.804 --> 40:28.628
When this was properly filed in my office...

40:28.708 --> 40:32.532
children always found
a way to come snooping.

40:32.612 --> 40:34.978
It's unwholesome, isn't it?

40:36.816 --> 40:39.005
And you, do you enjoy
poking your nose into all this?

40:39.085 --> 40:41.451
No.

40:44.424 --> 40:47.247
Don't mention it to Helenka.

40:47.327 --> 40:50.922
She is trying to forget.
Do you understand?

41:04.444 --> 41:06.266
I've known girls like you before:

41:06.346 --> 41:10.503
Can't stay in place,
always roving about...

41:10.583 --> 41:12.639
listening behind doors...

41:12.719 --> 41:14.674
interfering with everything.

41:14.754 --> 41:17.814
In the end, they always
get what they deserve.

42:00.567 --> 42:03.195
You told her.

42:05.205 --> 42:07.694
- You told her.
- What?

42:07.774 --> 42:09.496
- Francard knows.
- Of course she knows.

42:09.576 --> 42:12.773
- Have you looked at yourself?
- I don't believe you.

42:14.848 --> 42:16.873
- Why did you tell her?
- Didn't need to.

42:18.017 --> 42:22.876
You can see it in your eyes.
We have known it since before you got here.

42:22.956 --> 42:28.121
What do you think? What's important
is that you, you accept it here.

42:29.329 --> 42:31.418
Oh, silly thing.

42:31.498 --> 42:33.932
Thinks she can fool the world.

42:36.669 --> 42:40.571
We know, girl. We know.

43:12.672 --> 43:14.594
Good-bye, Madame Francard.

43:14.674 --> 43:18.509
Don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

45:14.961 --> 45:16.895
Judith.

45:25.438 --> 45:28.294
- Please make an effort.
- What?

45:28.374 --> 45:31.030
You've got to tell me.

45:31.110 --> 45:34.204
I saw the other children in the chapel.

45:35.648 --> 45:39.739
- The scary children.
- The children.

45:39.819 --> 45:42.549
I saw their pictures in the chapel.

45:45.224 --> 45:50.252
Marie talked about them all the time,
the scary children.

45:58.805 --> 46:03.229
They come to see me at night
when I'm sleeping.

46:03.309 --> 46:05.743
I can hear them.

46:13.419 --> 46:15.944
Judith, I came because I'm here too.

51:35.812 --> 51:37.734
Remember what you said yesterday?

51:37.814 --> 51:40.203
Please remember.
That I could keep the kittens.

51:40.283 --> 51:44.007
- Oh, it's not a good idea.
- But you've gone and said it yesterday.

51:44.087 --> 51:47.921
- Let's talk about it tomorrow.
- No, we talk about it today.

52:00.220 --> 52:03.543
I have to finish my work.

52:03.623 --> 52:07.514
Come on, I'll help you.

52:07.594 --> 52:09.983
I have a lot of work to do, you'll see.

52:10.063 --> 52:13.787
I don't care. I'll go and hide, and if you
don't find me, I'll keep the kittens.

52:13.867 --> 52:16.256
Helenka, come on. I'll go and hide.

52:16.336 --> 52:18.827
Leave that liar alone where she belongs.

52:23.510 --> 52:25.637
Judith, over here.

52:31.017 --> 52:33.695
Whoo.

52:37.957 --> 52:40.449
Catch me.

53:16.930 --> 53:18.989
What do you want?

54:54.411 --> 54:57.634
What is it?

54:57.714 --> 54:59.841
Anna, what is it?

55:04.888 --> 55:06.913
Anna, calm down.

55:11.761 --> 55:15.253
Calm down, and we'll
talk about it, all right?

55:32.115 --> 55:35.710
I suppose I invented this too.

55:38.254 --> 55:40.443
Do you have any idea what the world is?

55:40.523 --> 55:44.781
Or are you in the same world
as Judith? Listen, Anna.

55:44.861 --> 55:47.117
If you're looking for troubles,

55:47.197 --> 55:50.920
all you need to do
is to tell her all about it.

55:51.000 --> 55:54.333
As if she's not disturbed enough as it is.

56:00.410 --> 56:04.534
She arrived here in '46,
in the ambulance with the others.

56:04.614 --> 56:08.171
The others, where are they?

56:08.251 --> 56:13.310
How many survived do you think?
Huh? How many?

56:13.390 --> 56:15.879
Two lousy doctors for 300 kids.

56:15.959 --> 56:18.359
How many do you think we saved?

56:25.668 --> 56:27.602
What is it you are after?

57:10.980 --> 57:12.971
She arrived here in '46,

57:16.052 --> 57:18.077
in the ambulance with the others.

57:24.527 --> 57:26.950
The others, where are they?

57:27.030 --> 57:30.056
How many survived do you think?

57:37.273 --> 57:39.605
The kittens are gone!

57:43.513 --> 57:44.834
Where did they go?

57:44.914 --> 57:46.870
- I don't know where they are.
- Where are they?

57:46.950 --> 57:51.107
Calm down. I haven't seen the kittens.

57:51.187 --> 57:53.451
No, Judith.

58:12.842 --> 58:15.276
The kittens are gone.

58:20.850 --> 58:23.011
Where are you?

58:26.956 --> 58:30.585
Oh, please give them back to me.
Sweet Jesus, please.

58:46.376 --> 58:48.310
Judith, come and look.

59:30.653 --> 59:32.709
- You didn't, did you?
- No.

59:32.789 --> 59:36.412
- You didn't want me to keep them?
- Judith...

59:36.492 --> 59:40.517
- You said they were born in the wrong place.
- No.

59:40.597 --> 59:44.033
You didn't want me to keep them.

59:55.945 --> 59:58.434
She went to the wash shed, like she knew.

59:58.514 --> 01:00:03.940
She knew because she did it.
She's a liar like the others.

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:06.476
They were warned to hide the truth
of what happened here.

01:00:06.556 --> 01:00:09.116
The children wanted them to know.

01:01:02.912 --> 01:01:07.212
For years, they wanted you
to stay asleep. They lied.

01:01:10.787 --> 01:01:14.877
You're going to wake up
and remember what you saw.

01:01:14.957 --> 01:01:18.314
What?

01:01:18.394 --> 01:01:21.017
The children. Your brothers and sisters.

01:01:21.097 --> 01:01:25.355
They did things to them,
even worse than they did to you.

01:01:25.435 --> 01:01:28.324
But they're still here,
somewhere in the house.

01:01:28.404 --> 01:01:31.527
- You can feel them, can't you?
- I think so.

01:01:31.607 --> 01:01:34.132
Where are they?

01:01:38.381 --> 01:01:40.178
You're going to wake up.

01:04:20.076 --> 01:04:23.666
How much longer are you going to avoid me?

01:04:23.746 --> 01:04:26.369
Three days I haven't heard
a peep from you.

01:04:26.449 --> 01:04:30.072
All because I didn't want her
to keep the kittens.

01:04:30.152 --> 01:04:33.543
I never have touched
a hair on their backs.

01:04:33.623 --> 01:04:37.380
You know where she'll end up?

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.896
Locked up with the insane.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.041
Ah, stupid. Stupid.

01:05:32.281 --> 01:05:38.107
I remember a place, long ago,
where they put the children.

01:05:38.187 --> 01:05:42.511
What sort of children?

01:05:42.591 --> 01:05:45.047
Different ones.

01:05:45.127 --> 01:05:48.417
How different?

01:05:48.497 --> 01:05:50.620
Everything was different.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:54.523
Try to remember, Judith.
They need me, like you.

01:05:54.603 --> 01:05:59.061
It was beautiful, like paradise,
filled with children.

01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:01.336
Where were you?

01:06:02.712 --> 01:06:05.868
I played with them. It was beautiful.

01:06:05.948 --> 01:06:07.882
The refectory?

01:06:10.317 --> 01:06:11.866
No.

01:06:11.966 --> 01:06:15.678
- The main hall?
- No.

01:06:15.758 --> 01:06:18.158
Try to remember, Judith.

01:06:20.327 --> 01:06:23.324
I think there was a corridor. Maybe not.

01:06:24.834 --> 01:06:27.192
In the big bathroom?

01:06:28.371 --> 01:06:30.999
In the big bathroom?

01:06:32.141 --> 01:06:34.075
The bathroom.

01:07:04.907 --> 01:07:07.063
Are they here?

01:07:07.143 --> 01:07:09.077
Somewhere behind the walls.

01:07:10.646 --> 01:07:12.671
I just know they're going to want to play.

01:07:44.613 --> 01:07:46.604
Give me the light.

01:07:49.785 --> 01:07:51.776
Judith, the light.

01:09:39.694 --> 01:09:41.629
Did you see them?

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.761
I told you they'd want to play.

01:10:23.906 --> 01:10:25.840
Are they here?

01:10:28.844 --> 01:10:30.778
Are you here?

01:11:02.044 --> 01:11:04.706
It's them?

01:11:47.222 --> 01:11:51.989
Come down. There's all
that broken glass to fall on.

01:11:54.863 --> 01:11:57.586
If you go there, you can't come back.

01:11:57.666 --> 01:12:00.756
It's all rotten in there.

01:12:00.836 --> 01:12:02.929
You'll see.

01:12:08.077 --> 01:12:10.341
Stop it.

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:16.808
My God.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.854
- Did you see them? Did you see them?
- Calm down.

01:13:01.797 --> 01:13:06.755
- Calm down!
- What did you do to them?

01:13:06.835 --> 01:13:10.498
They've been gone and buried for 15 years.

01:13:12.408 --> 01:13:15.343
- There were too many of them.
- Leave her alone!

01:13:18.914 --> 01:13:21.712
More lies! You're a liar!

01:13:23.485 --> 01:13:25.510
You want them to lock me up!

01:13:50.446 --> 01:13:52.573
They're here? You see them?

01:14:16.071 --> 01:14:17.595
Is this where you play?

01:16:03.645 --> 01:16:05.909
Anna!

01:16:08.684 --> 01:16:12.407
Don't go in there! It's over, Anna.

01:16:12.487 --> 01:16:17.186
It's over. It's done.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.193
- It works with a switch.
- Oh, please tell me you're not going in there.

01:16:22.965 --> 01:16:26.355
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Don't. Don't, please.

01:16:26.435 --> 01:16:28.130
Let me go!

01:16:34.943 --> 01:16:37.403
It doesn't work.

01:16:43.318 --> 01:16:45.240
There's no one here anymore.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.220
Let's go.

01:16:48.624 --> 01:16:50.819
Come.

01:16:58.166 --> 01:16:59.964
No!

01:17:13.982 --> 01:17:17.729
No! No!

01:17:21.021 --> 01:17:22.490
No!

01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:28.984
The door's got to be shut for it to work.

01:17:29.064 --> 01:17:31.658
No!

01:17:33.201 --> 01:17:35.294
Stay there. Don't leave, please.

01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:39.194
If I don't come back, you can get help.

01:17:39.274 --> 01:17:41.630
Who?

01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:45.003
You'll know. You're a big girl.

01:28:18.379 --> 01:28:21.678
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

01:29:33.054 --> 01:29:36.649
- What was she doing in here?
- Madame Francard.

01:29:38.559 --> 01:29:40.322
Here she is.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.753
- What do we do?
- We don't touch a thing.

01:31:16.958 --> 01:31:20.248
There's nothing left to do
except call the police.

01:31:20.328 --> 01:31:22.262
We're leaving.

01:31:24.198 --> 01:31:27.121
I should never have left her alone.

01:31:27.201 --> 01:31:29.690
What more could you have done, huh?

01:31:29.770 --> 01:31:33.672
Apart from coming to fetch me.
You did very well.

01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:39.133
I should have come sooner,

01:31:39.213 --> 01:31:41.869
when she drowned the kittens.

01:31:41.949 --> 01:31:45.373
Then Judith wouldn't
have turned against me.

01:31:45.453 --> 01:31:48.276
Is she taking her pills again?

01:31:48.356 --> 01:31:51.553
I'm seeing to it. You can bet on it.

01:32:01.536 --> 01:32:04.725
Are you ready?

01:32:04.805 --> 01:32:06.739
Come on.

01:32:42.143 --> 01:32:45.704
- Judith?
- I'm just taking a souvenir.

01:33:18.379 --> 01:33:20.313
Judith.

01:35:02.883 --> 01:35:05.215
Judith?
