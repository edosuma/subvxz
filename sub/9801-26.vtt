<i>corrections: honeybunny</i>

00:11.592 --> 00:14.865
It's the break-out,
that led to a stake-out ...

00:14.866 --> 00:17.365
because there is a snake out.

00:17.366 --> 00:22.547
Savio, the Hoboken Zoo's
vicious boa constrictor has escaped!

00:22.548 --> 00:26.570
Wait. Why do I feel
I know that reptile?

00:26.764 --> 00:29.277
Snake belly!
So dark!

00:29.278 --> 00:31.565
Don't put me in the monkey suit!

00:36.607 --> 00:42.144
Savio, the fiendish serpent who temporarily ate
Private, the lemurs and Marlene.

00:42.145 --> 00:44.564
Right!
I hated that guy.

00:44.565 --> 00:48.375
We go live to Bonnie Chang
on the scene.

00:48.575 --> 00:51.040
Trash fires, riots on the street.

00:51.041 --> 00:55.004
The snake escape really has
everyone on edge, Bonnie?

00:55.869 --> 00:58.772
<i>No, Chuck.
That's just Hoboken.</i>

00:58.773 --> 01:02.268
<i>Back off, palio!
I'm packing a pipewrench.</i>

01:02.269 --> 01:05.437
<i>The boa was last seen,
entering the Hudson River</i>

01:05.438 --> 01:08.785
<i>where it appeared to be
swimming toward Manhattan.</i>

01:08.786 --> 01:11.708
I don't think Savio is still mad,
we had him shipped back to Hoboken ...

01:11.709 --> 01:14.183
<i>As every
herpetologist knows, Chuck,</i>

01:14.184 --> 01:17.779
<i>this breed of boa has
an insatiable thirst for vengeance.</i>

01:17.780 --> 01:22.116
<i>Nursing a grudge for months,
before reaching his hideous retribution.</i>

01:25.837 --> 01:28.998
Move out, you Nancy cats.

01:28.999 --> 01:32.243
Wait, wait. You think
Savio is coming after us?

01:32.244 --> 01:35.409
But that's crazy!
Most of us were his victims!

01:35.410 --> 01:38.605
Don't try and make sense
of revenge, Marlene.

01:38.606 --> 01:39.820
It cheapens it.

01:39.821 --> 01:42.131
But w... what do we do?

01:42.132 --> 01:44.133
Wait.
I've got an idea.

01:44.134 --> 01:48.049
A sandwich,
that could ride like a horse?

01:49.145 --> 01:51.212
Think about it.

01:51.213 --> 01:55.233
According to my projections,
Savio will hit this zoo in three hours.

01:55.234 --> 01:58.659
Luckily, that vengeful
maniac is forgetting one thing.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.987
We still got our
Big Grey on our side.

02:00.988 --> 02:03.664
Ready for another
Savio-pounding launcher?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.742
You bet.
Just as soon as I open...

02:05.743 --> 02:08.517
this mysterious package,
that came from Hoboken.

02:08.518 --> 02:09.556
Oh, it's big ...

02:09.556 --> 02:10.669
...not Ho-bo-ken!

02:10.669 --> 02:12.144
Don't open that!

02:13.942 --> 02:16.598
Savio sends his regards.

02:23.161 --> 02:27.324
Taking out the biggest threat.
Well played, Savio.

02:27.325 --> 02:30.938
Well, clearly he's a vengeful genius.
And we're all doomed.

02:30.939 --> 02:34.526
- Help! Help!
- I'm panicking!

02:35.079 --> 02:37.546
Easy, little tuna-melt.

02:40.890 --> 02:42.805
Sorry, people.

02:42.806 --> 02:44.705
For when no one listens to reason,

02:44.706 --> 02:47.342
I'm forged to speak
the language of nuts.

02:47.343 --> 02:50.060
This one said
"hello" to my nosehole.

02:50.061 --> 02:53.779
We can still take Savio.
But only as united front.

02:53.780 --> 02:56.513
Nobody cracks.
No one does anything stupid.

02:56.514 --> 02:59.418
Why you're all so
scared defenseless about this?

02:59.453 --> 03:03.051
I say, we take this Savio
and then we punch him in the face!

03:03.052 --> 03:05.485
So as usual, ignore everything
that Ringtail says ...

03:05.486 --> 03:08.661
as in "Did I hear something
gunhaul about that gundigger"?

03:08.662 --> 03:13.991
If by "gunhaul" you mean: I'm gonna
hold up this Savio and smack him around!

03:13.992 --> 03:17.494
Like that. Yeah, baby!
That's it.

03:17.495 --> 03:19.933
You're seriously not scared?

03:19.934 --> 03:21.613
We're still talking about Savio?

03:21.614 --> 03:24.568
Yeah.
Big teeth, long booty...

03:24.569 --> 03:28.222
fancy continental accent,
he think, is so classy.

03:28.733 --> 03:30.393
Bring him on to me!

03:30.394 --> 03:31.791
Enough!

03:33.271 --> 03:35.482
Ain't so bad.
Ain't so bad.

03:36.723 --> 03:38.316
There gonna be no rematch.

03:39.228 --> 03:40.405
Come on!

03:40.427 --> 03:42.680
All right,
give me two-man teams.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.568
Establish perimeter defenses.

03:44.569 --> 03:47.895
I want this zoo wired hotter
than a Brazilian Hanuka!

03:47.896 --> 03:48.909
Go!

03:49.715 --> 03:53.522
Now I'll need a cool fearless
head as my own buddy.

03:54.190 --> 03:57.187
Ringtail, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this...

03:57.188 --> 03:59.118
...but that guy is you.

04:02.347 --> 04:06.176
- Partner hug!
- Oh, no.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.887
Alright Ringtail, I think
a 3-layer defense grid.

04:09.888 --> 04:12.577
Level 1 - the minefield.

04:18.608 --> 04:19.712
Ok, what's next?

04:19.713 --> 04:24.114
Well, we take clear path through
the minefield to the others and then...

04:24.867 --> 04:25.741
What?

04:25.742 --> 04:29.269
Level 2 - electrified fence.

04:32.048 --> 04:34.215
- It was not my fault.
- Level 3:

04:34.216 --> 04:37.880
Mortitudes.
loaded with pure knockout spray.

04:37.949 --> 04:40.303
The cute old gas.

04:40.304 --> 04:41.791
No, no!

04:49.858 --> 04:51.874
What do you say, soldier?

04:51.875 --> 04:57.063
I say: Hey Savio,
who's gonna save you

04:57.064 --> 04:58.362
from that?

04:58.470 --> 05:00.371
Taunting and brute.

05:00.372 --> 05:03.172
I don't know where this 180 turn
came from, Ringtail,

05:03.173 --> 05:05.163
but I'm diggin' it.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.003
Yeah. I was
pretty awesome this time.

05:09.358 --> 05:11.242
Alright, men and Marlene.

05:11.243 --> 05:15.646
Some of you, I know, are wondering
whether or not, you'll chicken out under fire.

05:15.647 --> 05:17.014
Don't worry about it.

05:17.015 --> 05:22.762
When you put your hand into 
a fist-shape,

05:22.763 --> 05:27.891
then you realize ... wait, this is an ice cream
sandwich and chicken, shaped like a clown.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.747
You know what to do!

05:30.748 --> 05:32.581
I like old Julien.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.728
What if we kicked him into the snake,
just give us enough time to run?

05:35.729 --> 05:38.763
Any foot-touching
is good for touching.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.880
He's hit the mines!
For positions!

05:42.910 --> 05:44.711
No visual yet, but ...

05:44.712 --> 05:46.853
he cleared the minefield!

05:46.894 --> 05:48.926
<i>I don't see him, Skipper.</i>

05:50.291 --> 05:53.174
Fall back, Privates.
Shock unit, talk to me.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.611
Electrified fence is still
operative, Skipper ... oh.

05:58.344 --> 05:59.914
<i>He goes through the wall!
He's through.</i>

05:59.915 --> 06:02.431
Fall back!
Gassy-lassie, you're up!

06:02.432 --> 06:05.894
Hey, I did not agree to that ...

06:14.404 --> 06:15.622
Is he out?

06:28.083 --> 06:31.972
All units: Don't save positions!
Moving, Ringtail!

06:31.973 --> 06:33.666
Aye, Skip-king!

06:34.772 --> 06:35.917
Shields up!

06:35.959 --> 06:39.311
We drilled for this, people.
Just maintain the circle.

06:39.312 --> 06:44.254
Remember, this Savio is nothing.
He's ...

06:45.381 --> 06:47.140
Hello.

06:47.511 --> 06:50.334
Snake!
Savio is the snake?

06:50.445 --> 06:52.448
I thought that was that guy!

06:52.449 --> 06:55.672
You know, big teeth,
long booty ...

06:55.673 --> 06:57.490
I'm my own kind of beautiful.

06:57.491 --> 07:00.562
Oh, shut up with the fancy
continental accent, already!

07:00.563 --> 07:03.225
You aren't impressing anybody!

07:03.345 --> 07:08.967
Oh, shields! How adorable,
I can just eat you up.

07:08.968 --> 07:12.361
Stand fast, as long there
are no gaps in a circle ...

07:12.362 --> 07:14.234
I have to go. I don't want
be eaten. Goodbye!

07:14.235 --> 07:17.445
... ah, we could be safe.

07:21.075 --> 07:24.066
Since when the inside of a snake
belly looks like the garage?

07:24.067 --> 07:29.849
Don't worry, succulent one.
Soon you all will be consumed ...

07:29.850 --> 07:34.014
without narration, when I tell
you about my plan for revenge.

07:34.015 --> 07:36.789
I'm going to swallow you
one by one,

07:36.790 --> 07:40.539
so the last chosen will see
his friends go before him.

07:41.574 --> 07:44.712
And then I'll regurgitate you out
and swallow you again.

07:44.713 --> 07:49.733
But this time in reverse order, so none feels
left out of the "watch-everybody-get-eaten" thing.

07:49.734 --> 07:51.296
Well, then, way to make it your own.

07:51.297 --> 07:53.549
I like to take
the time to chew ...

07:53.550 --> 07:55.151
on my ideas.

07:55.186 --> 07:59.282
But we're still one lemur
shorter of full revenge set.

07:59.283 --> 08:02.090
And so, until I return ...

08:03.002 --> 08:04.771
... ciao.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.421
That is also reference to the fact
that I'm not to eat you.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.606
We got it.

08:10.607 --> 08:12.041
Fantastic.

08:14.153 --> 08:15.726
- Hello.
- Ringtail?

08:15.727 --> 08:18.303
Quick, I think I can guide you
to pick this lock.

08:18.304 --> 08:22.066
Now, it's a wave tumbler model 
with at least 7 variable spring loaded...

08:22.067 --> 08:24.701
Yeah, that sounds hard.

08:25.107 --> 08:28.711
I'm here for more the ...
last request ... sort of things.

08:28.712 --> 08:31.423
So OK, I've got the banjo.

08:31.424 --> 08:35.852
And if you feel snacky,
there's some day old popcorn, over there.

08:35.852 --> 08:37.658
Do you know "Ave Maria"?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.188
Boring!

08:39.190 --> 08:42.537
This one is way better.
Check it out.

08:42.538 --> 08:45.450
<i>"I'm a sandwich riding cowboy ... "</i>

08:45.735 --> 08:47.970
I knew you have
your flaws, Ringtail,

08:47.971 --> 08:49.788
but even at your worst moments,

08:49.789 --> 08:53.849
I've never peg you for
a yellow belly slimy coward.

08:53.850 --> 08:57.110
Ok, whoa.
That stinks.

08:57.888 --> 09:00.117
It's like you never
really knew me.

09:00.687 --> 09:03.715
Anywho, peace out, my people.

09:04.986 --> 09:07.414
Oh, the complete buffet.

09:07.415 --> 09:09.002
That's the snake!

09:11.264 --> 09:13.262
Oh no!
Not that way!

09:13.263 --> 09:14.645
Be tall, Ringtail!

09:14.646 --> 09:17.287
You got to decide,
what kind of man you gonna be!

09:17.288 --> 09:19.743
Still the yellow belly slime guy!

09:21.531 --> 09:25.371
He's going to die,
the way he lived. Stupid.

09:29.162 --> 09:34.113
Artificial butter flavor.
How ... tasteful of you.

09:44.396 --> 09:45.934
Bye bye!

09:48.253 --> 09:50.504
Boys, butter me up!

09:50.505 --> 09:52.350
Your leadership is impeccable.

09:52.385 --> 09:56.252
And your mask is an intoxicating
blend of danger and...

09:57.432 --> 09:58.583
Right.

09:59.355 --> 10:00.797
Greasy, greasy!

10:11.059 --> 10:13.615
Julien, you... did it!

10:13.616 --> 10:15.858
I don't accept your
thank you-s.

10:15.859 --> 10:17.978
Cause they are cheap and useless.

10:17.979 --> 10:20.662
Give me something shiny, people!

10:20.663 --> 10:22.624
Men, return to base for clean up.

10:22.625 --> 10:25.646
I've got grease,
where no grease should ever go.

10:25.746 --> 10:29.881
And so, snakeout ends as these
things always do.

10:29.882 --> 10:35.525
With the snake headed home, coated
in buttery hydrogenated soil oil.

10:35.526 --> 10:40.135
I can't believe, yellow bellied
slimy coward was really the answer.

10:40.136 --> 10:42.911
No, no.
This was a team victory.

10:42.912 --> 10:45.140
There was me, the butter ...

10:45.426 --> 10:47.414
Me wearing the butter ...

10:47.466 --> 10:49.942
You know, probably the elephant 
or something...

10:49.943 --> 10:50.782
The elephant!

10:50.783 --> 10:52.568
This is Chuck Charles,
who says ...

10:52.569 --> 10:55.904
Go time!
Come on, where's that snake?

10:55.905 --> 10:57.512
I want Savio!

10:58.005 --> 11:00.512
