00:16.959 --> 00:19.250
( theme music playing )

00:49.375 --> 00:52.041
Come on, man,
I can't go in there
by myself.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.792
I don't like croissants.

00:53.792 --> 00:55.667
What was all that
about just then?

00:55.667 --> 00:58.291
- What?
- About you not
liking croissants?

00:58.291 --> 00:59.959
What are you
talking about?

00:59.959 --> 01:01.875
- What are you
talking about now?
- I don't like croissants.

01:01.875 --> 01:03.542
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

01:03.542 --> 01:04.625
I'm not going
in there, man.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.375
You've gotta
come in there with me.

01:06.375 --> 01:08.250
I can't go in there
by myself and buy
a croissant, can I?

01:08.250 --> 01:10.291
She'll think I'm weird.
You have to back me up.

01:10.291 --> 01:12.667
You have to be what's
called "my wingman."

01:12.667 --> 01:14.041
Oh, like in "Top Gun"?

01:14.041 --> 01:16.375
Stop comparing everything
to "Top Gun."

01:16.375 --> 01:19.583
It's not-- this situation's
nothing like "Top Gun."

01:19.583 --> 01:21.417
"Ooh, it's like
'Top Gun.'"

01:21.417 --> 01:23.083
Come on, it'll only
take five minutes.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.667
We've been out here
talking about it for
two hours now.

01:25.667 --> 01:26.750
What do I have to do?

01:26.750 --> 01:28.875
Just make me
seem popular.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.166
If I say something,
you agree with me.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.041
All right.

01:34.041 --> 01:35.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.875
Um, I'd like
a croissant, please.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.834
Yes, that's true,
he would.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.166
Okay, a croissant, sure.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.583
He's very popular.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.291
( Jemaine whispers )
Be more subtle
about it.

01:44.291 --> 01:45.458
Mmm, that's true.

01:45.458 --> 01:48.166
I suppose he didn't
have to say that.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.709

04:26.834 --> 04:29.000
Yep.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.542
Do you like having
nice conversations?

04:31.542 --> 04:33.667
No. Nope.

04:35.291 --> 04:36.959
There's been
a big mix-up, Bret.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.250
A disastrous mix-up.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.208
'Cause I was
talking to Lisa

04:41.208 --> 04:43.166
and then that was
going very well

04:43.166 --> 04:45.583
and then I dropped
my wallet, there was
some confusion

04:45.583 --> 04:47.583
and I think I ended up
talking to Felicia,

04:47.583 --> 04:50.333
when I should
be talking to Lisa.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.625
You are talking
to Lisa.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.125
- Am I?
- Yeah.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.333
Right, well that's
obviously what's happened.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.291
We should swap.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.041
( sighs )

05:04.917 --> 05:07.375
( chuckles )

05:07.375 --> 05:10.208
Oh, look, Bret's feeling
Felicia's breast.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.875
- Uh, I'm Felicia.
That's...
- Yes.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.542
- ...Lisa.
- Feeling Lisa's breast
then, probably.

05:15.542 --> 05:17.542
- Yeah.
- That must be nice for her.

05:17.542 --> 05:19.125
( sighs )
Yeah.

05:19.125 --> 05:23.333
Looks like she's responding
to that quite positively.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.041
Bret, how you doing?

05:26.041 --> 05:28.458
Good good.
Ah. Yeah.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.834
It's good.
How you guys doing?

05:30.834 --> 05:32.709
Pretty good.

05:32.709 --> 05:35.625
- Pretty good.
- I'm actually feeling
a little bit tired though.

05:35.625 --> 05:37.500
- I think maybe
we should go.
- No.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.375
Yeah, you know,
I'm feeling pretty tired too,

05:39.375 --> 05:41.333
- So I'm gonna--
- Oh no, we're staying out.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.417
- Yeah, but I have that thing--
- Yeah, we're staying out.

05:43.417 --> 05:45.083
- Good idea, good idea, Felicia.
- We're staying out.

05:45.083 --> 05:48.083
- Mm-hmm.
- That's Lisa,
I'm Felicia.

05:51.083 --> 05:54.041
Murray:
All right, finally,
item two.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.291
Any new business
from any of us?

05:57.291 --> 05:59.792
Any-- any news?
Jemaine, have you got any?

05:59.792 --> 06:01.500
Well, we've got
girlfriends now.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.542
Really?
Even both of you?

06:03.542 --> 06:05.250
Yeah, we've met them
and everything.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.166
I've told you
this before, guys.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.583
Okay, I don't want to have to,
you know, backpedal

06:09.583 --> 06:11.291
and repeat myself, but...

06:11.291 --> 06:13.667
it's like I said
when you were with Coco:

06:13.667 --> 06:15.834
"Bands shouldn't
have girlfriends."

06:15.834 --> 06:17.125
Okay?

06:17.125 --> 06:19.125
You'll lose
your female fan base.

06:19.125 --> 06:21.625
What about Wham?
You never saw Wham
with girlfriends.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.625
That's how they kept
the women wanting them.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.291
No girlfriends.

06:25.291 --> 06:26.750
Okay.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.291
- Okay?
- Okay.

06:29.500 --> 06:32.083
So how far did you get
with your girlfriend?

06:32.083 --> 06:34.333
Well, I don't want
to talk about that.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.375
I've told you about how
far I've been with...

06:36.375 --> 06:38.291
you know, Shelly,
last Christmas Eve.

06:38.291 --> 06:39.834
Yeah, I don't want
to hear that again.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.375
Yeah? Didn't you
like that story?

06:42.375 --> 06:44.417
- So what'd you do?
- Well, I kissed her.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.917
- Did you?
- And you felt
her breast.

06:46.917 --> 06:48.417
- Yeah.
- Hand on her breast.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.625
Oh whoa, Bret,
be careful.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.959
- What about you, Jemaine?
- Hmm?

06:53.959 --> 06:56.625
Come on, you tell me
what you got up to.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.458
Um, I saw Bret feeling
that lady's breast.

06:59.458 --> 07:01.208
No, I mean
with your girlfriend.

07:01.208 --> 07:03.625
Yeah, uh... good.

07:03.625 --> 07:05.291
Yeah, good, was it?

07:05.291 --> 07:08.542
It-- pretty good.
It was... ( mumbling )

07:08.542 --> 07:10.625
Hmm, good.

07:10.625 --> 07:13.250
You're not the only ones
with good news, actually.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.834
My car broke down
in the ghetto.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.000
That's not the good news,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.083
but do you know
about the ghetto?

07:19.083 --> 07:20.583
- Yes.
- No.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.250
Yeah, well you know
the Elvis song,
"In the Ghetto"?

07:22.250 --> 07:23.542
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.500
Well, it's exactly like
he describes it.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.667
It's... whoa.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.417
Anyway, I met
A.J. Jones.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.959
- Who's that?
- He's the brother
of Quincy Jones.

07:30.959 --> 07:32.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.291
- You know, the music producer.
- Yeah yeah yeah, wow.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.667
And so now we-- we've done
some business already.

07:36.667 --> 07:38.041
Are you serious?

07:38.041 --> 07:40.291
He said he could
sell me a high-end
stereo system for $50.

07:40.291 --> 07:43.375
- That's not band-related.
- You're in a band,
you play music,

07:43.375 --> 07:45.792
so does the stereo.
There's your relation,

07:45.792 --> 07:47.375
all right?
And Quincy Jones,

07:47.375 --> 07:49.875
he's the music producer,
isn't he?

07:49.875 --> 07:52.625
What's some of the albums
that he's produced, Bret?

07:52.625 --> 07:55.208
- Michael Jackson's
"Off the Wall."
- Yeah, whoa.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.166
I'll say he is.
He's crazy.

07:57.166 --> 08:01.083
Off the planet.
Isn't he going to
freeze himself?

08:04.667 --> 08:06.625
- ( answering machine beeps )
- Hey, Bret, Lisa here.

08:06.625 --> 08:09.709
Listen, Felicia and I
had a really good time
last night.

08:09.709 --> 08:11.875
- Felicia: Shut up,
would you?
- Lisa: Anyway,

08:11.875 --> 08:13.709
we were wondering if you'd
like to come out tonight.

08:13.709 --> 08:16.291
7:00-ish?
Hope you like Italian!
Call me.

08:16.291 --> 08:17.542
( beeps off )

08:17.542 --> 08:19.166
- Did you hear that, Bret?
- Yeah.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.250
- Did you hear the message?
- I'm not going out tonight.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.917
What?

08:23.917 --> 08:26.792
What are you talking about?
It's girls and spaghetti.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.417
We love girls
and spaghetti.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.625
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna say we're busy.

08:30.625 --> 08:33.959
No way, man.
You're my wingman,
I need you.

08:33.959 --> 08:36.250
We've got it all,
the girls love us.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.417
We're like Wham.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.000
I don't want to
go too fast, you know.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.917
I don't want her to
think that I'm easy.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.583
You want her to think
you're more difficult?

08:42.583 --> 08:46.583
Do you think I dress
too provocatively?

08:46.583 --> 08:47.375
No.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.792
Man:
If I may be so bold,

08:49.792 --> 08:52.750
I think you're showing
a little too much arm.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.500
- Am I?
- Jemaine: Mmm.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.250
Yeah, you look
a little cheap.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.291
No, you don't look cheap, Bret.
You look fine.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.250
- May I make
a suggestion?
- No. Fix the sink.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.542
Women don't objectify
men in that way, Bret.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.333
Yeah, okay,
maybe I'll come tonight.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.125
Yeah, and wear something
a little sluttier.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.542
Give her something
to look at.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.458
I guess I want to show her
a little bit of arm,

09:10.458 --> 09:13.250
'cause I don't want her
to lose interest entirely.

09:13.250 --> 09:16.375
Yeah, you don't want the bear
to go completely hungry,

09:16.375 --> 09:18.291
you don't want it
to attack,

09:18.291 --> 09:20.542
so give it
a little bait,

09:20.542 --> 09:22.125
keep it interested.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.625
Fix the sink, please.

09:23.625 --> 09:27.583
The sink works.
It just comes out
of a different place.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.125
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.875
- How's it going?
- What's up?

09:35.875 --> 09:38.125
- Bit rough,
isn't it?
- Eh.

09:38.125 --> 09:41.000
So, well thanks
for taking time out
of your busy schedule,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.625
you know, to meet
with me, Mr. Jones.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.125
Eh, call me
A.J., man.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.792
Right. Oh, with regards
to your proposal,

09:46.792 --> 09:48.250
I've spoken
to the guys, A.J.,

09:48.250 --> 09:52.291
and they said they're keen.
We want the stereo, so...

09:52.291 --> 09:53.667
Good, 80 bucks.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.000
Okay.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.291
I haven't got
any with me now--
some shit went down.

09:57.291 --> 10:01.291
Oh really?
Okay, sorry to hear
about shit going down.

10:01.291 --> 10:02.792
You need
any hot pants?

10:02.792 --> 10:05.208
- Pardon?
- I got a shitload
of hot pants.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.500
You talk to anyone who's
looking for hot pants,
send them my way.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.417
All right,
I will. Okay.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.667
Good. I've got to go,
I've got a meeting.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.500
Oh, A.J.? Um...

10:13.500 --> 10:15.417
I was just wondering
if you'd do us a favor.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.166
You know, I manage
a rock band.

10:17.166 --> 10:19.917
What-- what are
the chances of me playing

10:19.917 --> 10:22.166
a demo of theirs
to your brother?

10:22.166 --> 10:23.917
- My brother?
- Yeah.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.792
Quincy, you know.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.917
Oh, my older brother.

10:27.917 --> 10:31.291
Yeah yeah, Quincy.
Uh, let me hear the track.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.208
- Just um...
- ( phone beeping )

10:33.208 --> 10:35.667
- Listen to that.
- Bret: ♪ Who likes
to rock the party? ♪

10:35.667 --> 10:38.875
Jemaine:
♪ He likes
to rock the party. ♪

10:38.875 --> 10:41.041
Can I tell you
my honest opinion?

10:41.041 --> 10:42.375
- Yep.
- I love it.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.542
- You do?
- I'll tell you what:

10:44.542 --> 10:46.083
I can help you
with a single,

10:46.083 --> 10:48.417
because I'm also
in the CD-single-
manufacturing business.

10:48.417 --> 10:52.750
If you're interested,
I could talk to my people--
Quincy...

10:52.750 --> 10:54.333
- Oh.
- ...and the gang,

10:54.333 --> 10:56.041
and we could
put something together.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.917
Very interested.
We'd definitely go for that.

10:57.917 --> 10:59.792
- All right. Good good.
- All right! Thanks a lot.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.583
You're still getting
that sound system, right?

11:01.583 --> 11:02.959
Oh yeah, of course.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.875
I don't want you to think
we're pulling one over on you.

11:04.875 --> 11:07.250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.083
Thank you.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.583
( sighs )

11:39.208 --> 11:41.208
- You warm?
- Mmm.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.583
Hey, I think I might
head off now.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.083
Oh yeah yeah,
that's a great idea.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.083
Let's leave
the two lovebirds.
Come on.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.417
Oh.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.750
- Bye.
- See you guys.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.125
Lisa:
Felicia, you'll get
a cab, right?

11:53.125 --> 11:55.291
Yeah, I guess.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.792
A little muscley.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.625
Well, this is
my place, so...

12:05.625 --> 12:07.834
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you
for walking me home,

12:07.834 --> 12:09.792
and... it was
a lovely evening.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.792
It was a great evening.
I had a really good time.

12:11.792 --> 12:14.333
- Good night.
- Good night.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.750
Can-- can I come up
for some tea?

12:17.750 --> 12:20.792
Oh, you don't
want to come up,
it's a really small flat.

12:20.792 --> 12:24.291
Bret, how long do
you wait until you let
a girl come upstairs?

12:24.291 --> 12:26.208
Three years.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.583
( laughs )

12:28.583 --> 12:30.208
Oh, you're serious.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.667
What-- what do you think
I am, dangerous?

12:34.709 --> 12:36.834
Well, you can--
you can have a cup of tea

12:36.834 --> 12:39.291
but then
you've got to go home.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.792
Bret:
It's getting kind of late.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.291
I-- um, I've got to go
jogging in the morning.

12:44.291 --> 12:46.166
- Oh yeah.
- So...

12:46.166 --> 12:47.875
It is late,
isn't it?

12:47.875 --> 12:49.709
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.875
Um...

12:53.709 --> 12:55.500
Oh well, I mean I'm--

12:55.500 --> 12:58.542
I'm not gonna be able to
get a cab back to Brooklyn
this time of night,

12:58.542 --> 13:02.500
- so...
- Uh, I could give you
directions to the F train.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.542
Oh the-- that-- that's
a really dangerous stop.

13:04.542 --> 13:07.667
I mean, I-- I've heard
there's maniacs down there.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.625
- Maniacs?
- Yeah.

13:09.625 --> 13:11.542
Mmm. Well,
maybe you should stay.

13:11.542 --> 13:15.125
Yeah no, I think I should.
And I-- I mean, I'll be
fine on the couch

13:15.125 --> 13:18.041
or I could stay
in your bed...

13:18.041 --> 13:19.750
- with you.
- Yeah.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.291
Probably best
just the couch.

13:21.291 --> 13:24.709
Well, I'll sleep on
the couch, and you can
sleep on my bed.

13:24.709 --> 13:27.041
- How's that?
- You'll be comfortable
out here?

13:27.041 --> 13:28.542
Yeah yeah, that's--
that's good.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.667
Okay, great.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.375
I'll be in your bed.

13:32.375 --> 13:33.500
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.667
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.041
Bret?

13:44.041 --> 13:46.667
- Bretty?
- What are you doing?

13:46.667 --> 13:50.333
- I couldn't sleep.
- Well, you're not gonna
sleep any better up there.

13:50.333 --> 13:52.417
Could I just--
could I just sleep
next to you?

13:52.417 --> 13:53.834
I promise
I won't do anything.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.959
- No.
- Come on, just give me
a little sugar.

13:56.959 --> 14:00.291
- Definitely no sugar.
- You've been kissing me
all night, Bret.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.917
It's been
driving me crazy.

14:01.917 --> 14:04.750
You have to
give me just a little
somethin' somethin'.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.875

an unspoken rule.

Something very
disturbing happened to
me last night, Jemaine.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.041
- What?
- Well, you know Lisa.

16:01.041 --> 16:06.208
- Mmm.
- Well, it turns out
she's very aggressive.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.500
Did she hit you?

16:07.500 --> 16:09.750
- No, she wanted to
go all the way.
- Mmm.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.959
I thought you already
did go all the way.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.375
No, now she wants
to have sex.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.417
What gave you
that impression?

16:17.417 --> 16:19.458
She jumped on top of me
and then touched me
on the penis.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.083
Oh I see.
You're lying.

16:21.083 --> 16:22.583
No, she was all over me.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.166
It's like that scene
from "Top Gun."

16:24.166 --> 16:26.041
You know your favorite
scene in "Top Gun"?

16:26.041 --> 16:28.291
- I don't know that movie.
- Yeah, it's your
favorite scene.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.667
I don't know
the movie.

16:29.667 --> 16:32.250
Yeah, well,
it was full-on.
I'm not ready for it.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.959
How did you get her
to start it?

16:33.959 --> 16:35.709
I don't know,
I was asleep.

16:35.709 --> 16:37.792
Really? Hmm.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.667
And then what
did you do?

16:39.667 --> 16:41.750
Well, I just said,
"I'm not ready to have sex."

16:41.750 --> 16:44.750
- And that worked?
- No, that didn't
work at all,

16:44.750 --> 16:46.750
'cause then she wanted
to have sex.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.041
Oh.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.834
It worked then, good.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.375
I think Felicia's
pretty keen too.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.542
She gave me this free
day-old croissant.

17:05.834 --> 17:07.834
Conchord CDs.

17:07.834 --> 17:10.125
Original music
from New Zealand.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.166
( siren blares )

17:12.166 --> 17:14.417
Out of my area.

17:14.417 --> 17:17.083
Hey, Mel,
you want one of these?

17:17.083 --> 17:18.583
( giggling )

17:22.542 --> 17:24.250
Thanks, George.

17:24.250 --> 17:28.041
Hey, Dave, can I ask
you a question about
women's sexuality?

17:28.041 --> 17:29.959
Sure, you came to
the right place for that.

17:29.959 --> 17:32.166
I'm going out
with this American girl
who wants to, you know,

17:32.166 --> 17:34.959
- go-- you know, like,
do the whole...
- Mm-hmm.

17:34.959 --> 17:38.291
She wants to go
the whole way.
That means sex, right?

17:38.291 --> 17:41.125
Yeah and... I'm not
really ready for that.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.375
Bret's not ready
for it.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.417
- Yeah.
- Hot bod, gross face.

17:44.417 --> 17:47.458
I get it.
Just hit that shit
from behind.

17:47.458 --> 17:51.125
No no no, I just always
imagined that when I did
finally make the move,

17:51.125 --> 17:52.959
it would be
more special, you know?

17:52.959 --> 17:56.208
It would be flowers,
violins, I'd be
in a nice suit.

17:56.208 --> 17:58.125
Everything would
just be perfect.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.125
I don't know how you guys
do things in Europe...

18:00.125 --> 18:02.375
- Both: New Zealand.
- Yeah, probably.

18:02.375 --> 18:05.000
But in America,
if you want to spend some
time with the ladies,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
you got to
show 'em some sausage.
Am I right, Jemaine?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.667
What are you
talking about?

18:09.667 --> 18:11.417
I'm talking about
in the U.S., if you
want something,

18:11.417 --> 18:13.542
you've got to be prepared
to put out for it.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.959
How do you think I eat
so well every lunchtime?

18:15.959 --> 18:20.333
Hey, Mrs. Chang.
Thanks for the egg rolls, huh.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.166
What?

18:30.667 --> 18:34.333
Hey, Lisa, do you think
we can maybe just talk
for a little bit?

18:34.333 --> 18:36.250
Yeah.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.667
Don't-- don't-- do you
care about me at all?

18:38.667 --> 18:40.000
Yes.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.041
I mean, don't you know
that if a girl gets aroused

18:42.041 --> 18:45.208
and doesn't climax,
that she can really
damage herself?

18:45.208 --> 18:47.208
Bret, I might not
be able to have a baby.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.709
- I didn't know that.
- It's kinda common knowledge.

18:49.709 --> 18:52.625
- Well...
- I'm not-- I don't want
to make you feel bad,

18:52.625 --> 18:56.291
but it's just everybody
kind of knows that.

18:56.291 --> 18:59.208
I just think it might
be a bit too soon.

18:59.208 --> 19:01.667
Well, guess what?

19:01.667 --> 19:04.709
Tomorrow it's
not gonna matter
if you're ready or not.

19:04.709 --> 19:07.250
Mmm... why's that?

19:07.250 --> 19:10.375
Because tomorrow, Bret,
I ship out to Iraq.

19:10.375 --> 19:12.000
Iraq?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.709
Yeah, I'm in
Delta Force, Bret.

19:13.709 --> 19:16.208
You're in Delta Force?

19:16.208 --> 19:17.792
What's that?

19:17.792 --> 19:19.625
I gotta take one
for my country,

19:19.625 --> 19:23.041
so the least I could do
is take one from you.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.208
Felicia, hey.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.542
- Oh hey, Jemaine.
- I just wanted to tell you

19:28.542 --> 19:31.250
that I don't want
to have sex with you.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.875
Good, I don't
want to either.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.417
Oh.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.375
Oh-- ooh ooh!

19:37.375 --> 19:38.834
Felicia, I just
wanted to check.

19:38.834 --> 19:41.750
So who was it that
wanted to and who
didn't want to?

19:41.750 --> 19:44.542
Oh, it was both of us
that didn't want to.

19:44.542 --> 19:46.333
Yeah, you don't want to,
I don't want to.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.542
Yeah, don't want to.
You said you didn't want to...

19:48.542 --> 19:51.208
Mmm, oh yuck, no way.
But we could.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.792
Can we?

19:52.792 --> 19:55.166
Oh, so you do want to?

19:55.166 --> 19:58.709
No, I'm just--
I'm not interested
at all, Jemaine.

19:58.709 --> 20:01.709
- It's not gonna happen.
- Is it because I'm
too dangerous?

20:01.709 --> 20:04.166
'Cause you think
I'm just gonna ride
out of this town

20:04.166 --> 20:06.291
the same way I rode in,
and when I go,

20:06.291 --> 20:08.250
I'll take
your heart with me?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.917
No?

20:09.917 --> 20:11.959
Slight concern about that,
though, maybe?

20:11.959 --> 20:13.000
Mmm.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.125
Thought it was
gonna be that one.

20:15.125 --> 20:17.917
Look, Jemaine, I, um...

20:17.917 --> 20:19.917
I only went out with you
in the first place

20:19.917 --> 20:23.208
because Lisa kind of
like insisted  that
I be her wingman.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.458
You're her wingman?

20:24.458 --> 20:26.792
'cause Bret was supposed
to be my wingman.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.208
( sighs )

20:28.208 --> 20:30.125
- Look.
- That's why
you don't want to.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.166
- No, it's not why.
- Might be one of the reasons.

20:32.166 --> 20:34.667
Not any
of the reasons, but--

20:34.667 --> 20:37.041
Look. It's raining.
I've got to get going 'cause--

20:37.041 --> 20:39.041
Okay, there was,
"don't want to,"
"don't want to."

20:39.041 --> 20:41.000
- Do not want to.
- Okay.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.834
- Me too, don't want to.
- "Don't want to"
and "don't want to."

20:43.834 --> 20:45.458
- Okay, let's not then.
- Okay.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.542
I mean, that seems
to work out best
for both of us.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.542
- Okay, Jemaine,
good night.
- Okay.

20:49.542 --> 20:50.834
Good night.

20:56.291 --> 20:57.625
- Okay, move.
- Yeah.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.166
You can-- you can move
a little more.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.834
- Come on.
- Yeah.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.333
( grunts )

21:12.250 --> 21:14.667
- Um, Lisa?
- ( snoring )

21:14.667 --> 21:17.333
Could I
go home now?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.667
( water running )

21:23.667 --> 21:25.375
You okay, Bret?

21:25.375 --> 21:29.000
Could you please
get out of here?
I'm having a shower.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Okay. I was in here first.
You come in here

21:32.000 --> 21:34.166
with your clothes on,
crying.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.291
It was over
in five minutes.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.375
I mean,
she fell asleep.

21:39.375 --> 21:42.083
( clicks tongue )

21:42.083 --> 21:44.041
Are you and Lisa
gonna get married now?

21:44.041 --> 21:47.709
I wish, but I don't know.
She's got to go to war.

21:47.709 --> 21:48.834
What?

21:48.834 --> 21:50.667
Yeah, Iraq.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.375
- Iraq?
- Yeah.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.875
Lisa?

21:54.875 --> 21:58.291
Yes, she's in Delta Force.
She's been deployed
to Fallujah.

21:58.291 --> 21:59.959
( sighs )

21:59.959 --> 22:01.875
But she works in
the croissant shop.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.250
Yeah well,
she's got two jobs.

22:03.250 --> 22:06.709
She's a pastry chef
and a sniper.

22:06.709 --> 22:08.375
Hmm.

22:10.083 --> 22:13.125
Well, if it
makes you feel better,

22:13.125 --> 22:15.750
me and Felicia are probably
gonna have to break up too.

22:15.750 --> 22:18.542
She keeps
pressuring me into sex.

22:18.542 --> 22:23.125
"Give me some more sex."
Oh, give me a rest...

22:23.125 --> 22:24.750
for five minutes.

22:25.750 --> 22:28.250
( sighs, click tongue )

22:29.750 --> 22:32.375
( deep voice )
Cheer up, Bret.

22:32.375 --> 22:35.166
Mmm, it's
the talking stove.

22:35.166 --> 22:38.667
( deep voice )
Things'll work out.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.583
Yeah?

22:40.583 --> 22:42.583
You love
the talking stove.

22:42.583 --> 22:45.750
Oh, let's make
a cake.

22:50.750 --> 22:53.583
Murray:
Okay, so to sum up,

22:53.583 --> 22:58.166
basically, CD sales
are going okay,

22:58.166 --> 23:00.709
but a little slower
than I would have liked.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.375
How many have you sold?

23:02.375 --> 23:03.959
One.

23:03.959 --> 23:07.291
But I would have
liked to have gotten
a few more out than that.

23:07.291 --> 23:08.792
How many have you
got left?

23:08.792 --> 23:10.166
Two and a half thousand.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.417
Can I have one?

23:11.417 --> 23:14.125
You can have a whole box.
There you go.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.166
- Really?
- Yes, take it home.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.834
I can't store them here.
You-- Jemaine, you take one.

23:18.834 --> 23:21.625
- I don't want a whole box...
- Take a whole box home
with you.

23:21.625 --> 23:24.208
- What am I gonna do with it?
- I can't store them here.

23:24.208 --> 23:26.000
So just take--
take it home.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.750
In fact, if you can
take two boxes each...

23:27.750 --> 23:30.333
Murray, how many of these--
have you looked in all
the boxes?

23:30.333 --> 23:33.792
- Just the one.
- This one's got
sawdust in it.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.291
Oh my God.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.291
Did you buy some
sawdust as well?

23:37.291 --> 23:39.542
Open your box, Jemaine.

23:39.542 --> 23:41.375
Look, Murray.
Sawdust.

23:41.375 --> 23:43.667
We've been done.
I didn't tell you this,

23:43.667 --> 23:46.583
but I did the business
underneath an overpass,

23:46.583 --> 23:48.750
you know,
and he was dodgy
from the beginning.

23:48.750 --> 23:51.000
Jemaine:
What, you had sex
with him?

23:51.000 --> 23:54.208
No, he sold me
the sawdust boxes.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.333
Did you want to buy
sawdust, though?

23:56.333 --> 23:58.834
Bret, no!
I bought the CDs,
didn't I?

23:58.834 --> 24:00.834
It's a lot lighter.
Did you pick them up?

24:00.834 --> 24:02.834
Of course
I picked them up.

24:02.834 --> 24:06.625
I should find Quincy Jones
and let him know what
his brother's up to.

24:06.625 --> 24:08.500
He needs to know this.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.834
Oh, I haven't got
his number.

24:10.834 --> 24:12.500
Jemaine:
You could email him.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.667
I'd love to email him.

24:18.834 --> 24:20.959
Come on, Bret,
you're moping.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.542
Yeah, I just miss Lisa.
I think about her out there

24:23.542 --> 24:25.166
in Operation Sand Freedom.

24:25.166 --> 24:27.667
- Yeah, but you're
walking really--
- It's gonna be dangerous.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.542
You're walking
really slow.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.834
I want to send
her some croissants
in a care package.

24:31.834 --> 24:33.417
That'd be nice, right?

24:33.417 --> 24:36.208
- Don't-- uh.
- What?

24:38.125 --> 24:40.333
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hey, Bret.

24:40.333 --> 24:42.625
- You didn't ship out to Iraq?
- No, actually,

24:42.625 --> 24:44.458
didn't end up
going to Iraq.

24:44.458 --> 24:45.458
Oh really?

24:45.458 --> 24:47.375
Yeah-- oh no.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

24:47.375 --> 24:48.709
- Oh you are?
- Yeah.

24:48.709 --> 24:50.750
See, I told you.
She's a sniper.

24:50.750 --> 24:51.917
I'm a sniper.

24:51.917 --> 24:53.625
So then, maybe we should
go out tonight?

24:53.625 --> 24:57.208
Tonight, no... I don't--
I can't tonight.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.834
- What?
- Yeah, I'm sorry,

24:58.834 --> 25:01.208
but-- but you guys
should go.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.959
You guys should go out.
It'd be fun.

25:02.959 --> 25:06.709
But you said
you love me and...?

25:06.709 --> 25:09.250
- Oh.
- You had sex on me.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.375
No-- oh yeah,
that was just physical.

25:11.375 --> 25:13.625
- Just physical.
- It was just--
I mean, we were just--

25:13.625 --> 25:15.250
we were just using
each other, weren't we?

25:15.250 --> 25:17.709
- Just using each other.
- Oh, we were just
using each other.

25:17.709 --> 25:19.083
- Yeah.
- I see, yeah.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.625
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

25:20.625 --> 25:22.667
But, anyways,
it's-- I gotta--

25:22.667 --> 25:25.417
I mean, it's really busy
in here and I got to get
back to work but--

25:25.417 --> 25:27.417
I'd love to talk,
but you know.

25:27.417 --> 25:31.709
But it was great...
seeing you guys again.

25:31.709 --> 25:34.875
( women laughing )

25:34.875 --> 25:37.083
I know!
You see him?

25:37.083 --> 25:39.250
"I love you."

25:41.917 --> 25:45.625
Your real problem, Bret,
is the kind of girls
you go for.

25:45.625 --> 25:47.333
You're attracted
to bastards.

25:47.333 --> 25:48.875
- Bastard girls.
- It's true.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.959
They treat you badly
and you get into
a cycle of that.

25:50.959 --> 25:53.875
- Yeah.
- You've gotta
break out of that.

25:53.875 --> 25:55.458
- Hey, guys!
- Hey, Murray.

25:55.458 --> 25:57.375
Where's
your girlfriends?

25:57.375 --> 25:59.709
- Both: They're not here.
- I knew you didn't
have girlfriends.

25:59.709 --> 26:01.291
Yes we--
well, Bret did.

26:01.291 --> 26:03.000
- Yeah.
- He had one.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.834
- This will cheer you up.
- Sort of, she didn't really--

26:04.834 --> 26:06.709
- What?
- Jemaine, I've sold
all your CDs,

26:06.709 --> 26:08.625
- Every last one of them.
- Really?

26:08.625 --> 26:10.583
- Yep.
- People liked them?

26:10.583 --> 26:12.417
I sold them
to Dave.

26:12.417 --> 26:14.250
Apparently,
they're rewritable.

26:14.250 --> 26:17.250
So he just deletes
the music files and then
sells them as blank CDs.

26:17.250 --> 26:20.333
Apparently, it's worth
more that way so--

26:20.333 --> 26:22.125
- It's not ideal.
- It's not ideal,

26:22.125 --> 26:24.417
but yeah, they're still
getting out there,
aren't they?

26:24.417 --> 26:26.375
Yeah, well,
they're blank though.

26:26.375 --> 26:28.875
Yeah, but they'll
be out there,

26:28.875 --> 26:30.000
and-- you know.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.834
- As blanks.
- Yeah.

26:31.834 --> 26:33.333
- It's good.
- It's--

26:33.333 --> 26:34.792
It's good, I know.

26:34.792 --> 26:37.625
Just gotta find
someone that'll buy
this sawdust now,

26:37.625 --> 26:40.041
and I'll be complete.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.000
- See you soon.
- See you, Murray.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.834
- Good managing, Murray.
- Thanks, mate.

26:45.917 --> 26:48.542
Yeah. See...

26:48.542 --> 26:50.750
that girl
wasn't right for you.

26:50.750 --> 26:54.250
Yeah, I guess she wasn't
really good enough for me.

26:54.250 --> 26:56.166
I was thinking
she was too good for you.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.709
She was actually
too good for me.

26:57.709 --> 26:59.333
Yes, a bit too pretty
for you.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.083
- Hmm.
- Too good-looking.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.792
Hi. Are you Bret?

27:03.792 --> 27:07.083
- Bret: Uh...
- I'm a friend
of Lisa's.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.875
I heard you like
to have a good time.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.792
I'm Bret.

27:13.792 --> 27:16.041
( techno music playing )
