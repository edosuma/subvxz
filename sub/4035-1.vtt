<i>The road of life is always</i>
under construction.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.684
<i>The journey is hard,</i>

01:22.760 --> 01:26.048
<i>but once you reach the top,</i>
the view is amazing.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.610
<i>And that view is even more beautiful</i>
when you have someone to share it with.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.681
Mr. Blart.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.202
<i>For six days.</i>

01:39.560 --> 01:41.642
<i>My beautiful wife of almost a week</i>
let me know by letter

01:41.720 --> 01:44.849
<i>that she had what I like to call</i>
"some regrets."

01:44.920 --> 01:47.287
<i>Her doctor called it</i>
"uncontrollable vomiting."

01:47.360 --> 01:48.407
Honey.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.562
<i>Her lawyer, "Dissolution of marriage."</i>

01:52.160 --> 01:54.845
<i>That's okay. I needed a
little time to myself.</i>

01:54.920 --> 01:56.126
<i>Like the song says,</i>

01:56.200 --> 01:59.170
<i>"I've been to paradise,</i>
but I've never been to me."

02:00.320 --> 02:02.368
<i>I spent the next two years losing myself</i>

02:02.440 --> 02:06.047
<i>in the sweet escape of keeping</i>
the West Orange Pavilion Mall safe.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.969
<i>At least I still had the one thing</i>
that never seemed to let me down.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.201
<i>Security.</i>

02:12.280 --> 02:13.805
Are you lost, son?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.248
Anyway, come with me.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.322
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.527
Andy, now give the fake cop a hug.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.568
We're actually... We're certified, ma'am.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.325
We take a test and everything.
It's pretty vigorous.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.890
All right, hug him, Andy.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.167
Well, it was nice to see you, little man.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.004
You know what, ma'am,
he doesn't want to give me a hug.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.684
- And it's okay.
- No, he wants a hug.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.047
- I don't think he does. Hey.
- Okay, Andy, hug him.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.011
- Honey.
- Want to come in?

02:45.080 --> 02:47.003
- Sweetie. You're embarrassing Mommy.
- He doesn't want...

02:47.080 --> 02:48.684
- No, he's not embarrassing me. He's fine.
- Hug him.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.125
He doesn't have to hug me.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.604
I saw white. I saw white.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.249
I'll get him again, ma'am. I'll find him.

02:58.320 --> 03:00.800
<i>And on the home front, I always had Mom.</i>

03:01.880 --> 03:03.928
There's my paper.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.487
<i>That is, until she got</i>
drilled by a milk truck.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.768
<i>Didn't know they even had those anymore.</i>

03:13.680 --> 03:16.729
<i>I guess I was the last one to get the memo.</i>

03:16.840 --> 03:19.525
<i>Paul Blart had officially peaked.</i>

03:23.760 --> 03:25.364
<i>Or had I?</i>

03:25.960 --> 03:28.281
"Congratulations, Officer Blart.
You have been selected to join..."

03:28.360 --> 03:31.011
"Congratulations.
You have been accepted to UCLA."

03:31.520 --> 03:34.967
Maya! Come down here!
I got some great news!

03:35.520 --> 03:36.965
Me, too!

03:38.560 --> 03:42.531
Honey, we've been invited to the
Security Officers Trade Association Expo

03:42.600 --> 03:46.525
and award ceremony in Las Vegas, Nevada!

03:46.640 --> 03:48.085
Vegas? Wow.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.571
Yeah, I think I'm finally being recognized

03:49.640 --> 03:51.961
for, you know, getting the mall
out of that jam.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.930
Dad, you saved the mall.
They should honor you.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.166
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.811
You know, times have been tough,

04:00.880 --> 04:02.291
but no matter what happens,

04:02.360 --> 04:06.649
as long as I have you by my side,
I'm gonna be okay.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.609
But enough about me.
What's your great news?

04:09.680 --> 04:13.127
Yeah, I just remembered that

04:14.640 --> 04:16.449
we have leftover baked ziti.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.683
What a day!

04:54.360 --> 04:55.646
Yeah.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.727
All right.

05:01.240 --> 05:05.450
- Can I help you with your bags, sir?
- No. That's how they get you.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.364
<i>- I'll</i> be fine on my own, thank you.
- No problem, sir.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.084
Lift with the legs. With the legs.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.246
We're moving. Here we go.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.164
Nice little break in the day.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.686
We're going again. We're going again.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.006
Legs.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.003
- Paul Blart?
- Yes, sir.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.323
I thought that was you.
Donna Ericone, Mall of America.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.920
Man, we still talk about
your Black Friday save.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.441
Thank you.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.965
I don't know if you heard.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.520
There's gonna be
a surprise keynote speaker tonight.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.841
Word on the street, it's
gonna be the officer

05:47.920 --> 05:50.287
who's gone above and beyond
the call of duty.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.281
What?

05:52.560 --> 05:55.848
I got to be honest, I had a feeling,
but do you really think that, I mean...

05:55.920 --> 05:56.887
- Who else?
- Yeah.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.604
Unless RoboCop walks into the room.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.603
Yeah, I would definitely
stand down for RoboCop.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.170
- He's not real.
- No, I know he's not real,

06:02.240 --> 06:03.844
but I would stand down for him.

06:03.920 --> 06:04.967
He ain't real.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.724
Just don't tell anybody I told you.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.087
- Told me what?
- About the key...

06:10.160 --> 06:12.527
You got me. You done gone and got me.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.051
That was in the throat.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.561
That was in the throat.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.369
- See you tonight.
- Yeah, okay.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.767
Roger that, Officer Ericone.
That was straight to the throat.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.571
That didn't even glance off the chest.
It went right up.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.849
- May I help the next guest?
- We're next. Here we go. Yes.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.201
- Yello-ha!
- Good afternoon.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.090
- Welcome to the Wynn Resort.
- Checking in.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.528
Absolutely, Mr. Blart.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.923
Mr. Blart.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.684
You're probably thrown by the travel wear.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.923
- Actually, it's "officer."
- Okay, sorry about that.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.002
Yes, Officer Blart.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.765
I see we have you in a
partial mountain view,

06:49.840 --> 06:53.890
and you requested
a bottomless bowl of Peanut M&M's.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.289
Yeah, it's strictly medicinal.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.930
Unfortunately,
I am cursed with hypoglycemia.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.886
Sugar level drops, so do I.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.966
I'm sorry. Your room isn't ready yet.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.965
But you can leave your luggage here,
and I will have it delivered to your room.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.081
Dad, I'm starving.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.289
- Can we just go get some lunch?
- Hold the mayo.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.691
Hold on a second here.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.081
You probably didn't know this, Heath,

07:24.160 --> 07:25.969
but if you check the Grand Ballroom

07:26.040 --> 07:28.566
and see which group
is booked there this evening,

07:28.640 --> 07:30.881
I think your tune may change a wee bit.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.884
- Mini Kiss. The cover band.
- Yeah, I'm not with them.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.327
Is there a manager I could speak with?

07:40.200 --> 07:43.124
You know, she's not available
right now, so...

07:43.720 --> 07:45.688
You're taking my legs out
from under me here.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.445
- Is the Terrace CafÃ© open for lunch?
- Yes, it is.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.000
I'm out.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.891
Bring it in, Heath.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.042
Little tighter, bring it in. Yes.

07:54.160 --> 07:57.004
Just a little bit closer range.
I can't let this out.

07:57.120 --> 08:02.206
But it seems to be that I'm going to be
delivering the keynote speech tonight

08:02.280 --> 08:04.931
at the security officers' convention.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.526
You know, I think they canceled that.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.201
They didn't.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.443
But it was downsized to Conference Room C.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.127
Nope, F.

08:15.760 --> 08:19.207
- Okay, here's a map of the property.
- Okay.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.770
There you are.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.449
- Thank you.
- No, that's yours to keep.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.161
Don't need it. It's already been scanned.
Locked and loaded.

08:28.240 --> 08:29.526
Thank you. Time for some lunch.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.601
- Sir?
- Yeah?

08:30.840 --> 08:33.285
Your daughter and the restaurant
are that way.

08:34.880 --> 08:38.361
Yeah, you had that upside down when I scanned it.
That's why... It's on you.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.522
- Was I lying about the conch fritters?
- You were not.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.682
They're amazing,
with just the right amount of zip.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.923
- Yeah, you got to love the zip.
- I do. I mean, I was born to zip.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.241
<i>I put my hand upon my hip</i>
When I zip

08:48.320 --> 08:49.731
<i>- You zip</i>
- We zip

08:50.960 --> 08:52.883
I can't believe you know that song.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.285
Hey, sir. You actually
forgot your valet ticket.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.290
- Thank you.
- It's free.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.121
Yeah.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.651
I'm gonna go.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.450
You were born to zip?

09:06.800 --> 09:08.484
Since when do you use the word "zip"?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.807
- I always use the word "zip."
- I don't like it.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.331
Hipster talk. Everybody's zipping.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.922
You need to slow it down, young lady.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.040
Look, Dad, you're gonna have to get used
to the fact that I'm a big girl now.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.560
Okay, first of all, we're all big.
We're Blarts.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.680
Wide hips, thick ankles
and a low center of gravity.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.449
That's how the good Lord made us.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.171
That's why we're no good at running
hurdles, and we never will be.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.525
What is that?

09:31.600 --> 09:34.331
This? It's my vibrating fork.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.528
It forces me to eat slower.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.125
You think I eat fast at home?

09:38.200 --> 09:41.170
On vacation, I'm like a cheetah
chasing a faster cheetah.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.001
Okay, see? Look at that right there.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.050
It's just fuel. It's just fuel.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.647
Here you go.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.404
- Mr. Blart.
- Shanghai!

09:53.480 --> 09:55.164
Sorry. Sorry to startle you, sir.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.568
- That's okay. You just hit the trip wire is all.
- Okay.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.211
Well, I'm Divina Martinez,
the hotel's general manager,

10:01.280 --> 10:02.770
and I wanted to apologize

10:02.840 --> 10:05.491
about the confusion
regarding the convention.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.562
And good news, I upgraded your room.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.211
It has a view of the Strip.

10:09.280 --> 10:13.569
It's ready right now, and I wanted
to give you the keys personally.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.806
Sorry about that.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.769
Although, I must say,
you have very soft hands.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.091
Air bag!

10:22.480 --> 10:23.481
Excuse me?

10:24.200 --> 10:26.851
I sense what you're doing, Divina.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.800
What am I doing?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.887
Truthfully, being a bit transparent.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.928
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

10:36.320 --> 10:37.890
Look, I understand it's the 21st century,

10:37.960 --> 10:39.883
and a woman can go after hers
just like a man.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.921
- Dad, I'm pretty sure she wasn't...
- Tadpole, this is grown-up stuff. Okay?

10:45.120 --> 10:46.849
Look, I know it takes two to tango,

10:46.920 --> 10:49.207
but my dancing shoes
are currently out for repair.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.488
- Sir, I'm sorry if I...
- Apology not needed.

10:53.560 --> 10:57.281
Just know I'm working my way
through a maze of personal fire,

10:57.360 --> 11:00.045
and until the flames of chaos subside,

11:00.120 --> 11:02.805
I'm just not ready for public consumption.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.563
I understand, sir.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.165
Have a great stay.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.810
It's not just me, right?
I mean, she was relentless.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.130
Relentless.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.450
What troubles you, my pet?

11:23.240 --> 11:26.289
I just had the strangest exchange
with that guy over there.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.406
Yeah.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.769
He accused me of hitting on him.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.771
Funny.

11:35.880 --> 11:39.123
They say overweight people
use humor to achieve affection.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.801
You know what, that makes sense.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.688
Excuse me, Ms. Martinez?

11:46.760 --> 11:49.366
- Our VIP guest has arrived.
- Thank you.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.361
Okay.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.003
Welcome back to Wynn Las Vegas, Mr. Sofel.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.131
We have the accommodations
you requested all ready for you.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.801
If you need anything at all, please,
don't hesitate to call either myself

12:03.880 --> 12:06.042
or our head of security, Mr. Furtillo.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.448
You guys took me for
a lot of money on my last visit.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.921
Well, I hope you're able to
turn that around this time.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.085
I plan to.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.370
I got to say, I don't know
how this is an upgrade.

12:17.440 --> 12:20.762
I'll tell you what, Maya, you take the bed.
I will take the rollaway.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.764
Dad, this is your convention.
You can't sleep on the rollaway.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.571
I certainly can, okay?
I once fell asleep raking leaves.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.409
We'll figure it out later.
I got to get going.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.926
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.321
Thanks for telling me Victoria's secret.

12:33.440 --> 12:34.771
What do you think you're wearing,
youn glady?

12:34.840 --> 12:36.330
A bathing suit?

12:36.560 --> 12:38.085
Maybe for an elf.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.845
Decorum. De-cor-um.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.606
- I was just going to hang out by the pool.
- Yeah, well, not in that, you're not.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.091
Fine.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.690
- Then I'm going exploring.
- Hold up.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.205
- You got your extra phone battery?
- Yes.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.281
Flashlight?
- Always.

12:50.360 --> 12:51.441
- Hot pepper spray?
- Check.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.084
- Pocketknife keychain window smasher?
- I do.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.130
- Baby road flares?
- Yes, I've got it all!

12:56.200 --> 12:58.965
One more second here. There.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.441
I've set it to monitor,
so I can hear everything that's going on.

13:01.520 --> 13:03.921
No way. I already feel like a SWAT unit.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.731
Maya! Security is a mission.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.520
Not an intermission.

13:14.280 --> 13:16.806
Well, let's see if I bankrolled
the right NSA agent.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.722
- How's that?
- So far, so good.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.408
Excuse me, guys,

13:43.480 --> 13:45.081
but we have a complaint about the noise.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.160
That's why we have you.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.570
Gotta say, Henk, nice uniform.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.845
Right? Look at that. Smiley.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.922
You don't want to know
what it took to get the real deal.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.400
No, I don't.

14:01.560 --> 14:02.561
Okay.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.483
They've moved several of
the pieces in the last few days.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.722
Here's the new locations of all 13.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.122
Perfect. All right, I want to be in and out
in less than nine hours, people.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.281
Sync up.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.007
Sync.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.441
Let's go!

14:22.520 --> 14:24.807
Yes, shooter, yes! Yeah!

14:27.320 --> 14:29.891
- What's all the hoopla, friend?
- This guy's crushing.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.644
I'm literally running
out of room for my chips.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.722
He's on the greatest run I've ever seen!

14:33.800 --> 14:36.201
Sir, you're gonna have to place a bet
if you want to stand at the table.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.567
I don't know how to play craps,
but I'll tell you what,

14:38.640 --> 14:40.483
Lady Luck's certainly
been in my corner as of late.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.040
So I am in, okay? What do I do?

14:43.120 --> 14:45.964
It's easy. Give me $60.
We'll place the six.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.610
- $60.
- 60 bucks.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.564
Wow, this is exciting.
I got to be honest, very exciting.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.810
Sir, can I get you a drink?

14:54.640 --> 14:55.846
You know what, how much for a root beer?

14:55.920 --> 14:58.890
'Cause I'm currently very invested
in Mr. Wynn's casino.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.482
- Well, actually, it's complimentary.
- Complimentary.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.449
I love it! Root beers around the horn!

15:04.520 --> 15:06.682
What do you... Just one is fine. Just one.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.006
Sir, come on. This table's really hot.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.889
- Give me 20 bucks for the hard six.
- Okay, $20.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.166
- Give me $20 for the hard eight.
- $20.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.924
- Give me $25 for the horn high yo.
- $25.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.880
- Give me $20 on the field.
- That's all I have.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.604
- The field is out there.
- No more bets.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.331
All right! I've never felt more alive!

15:19.400 --> 15:21.004
Shooter, come on! Number...

15:21.080 --> 15:22.206
Seven out. Craps.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.364
- Loser!
- Fat guy ruined it.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.249
- You lost everything.
- You suck!

15:26.360 --> 15:29.603
Get your bets down,
C and E's, horn bets, high-lows.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.251
- Get this game going.
- Your root beer, sir.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.481
Thank you.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.046
Yeah, I would love that.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.920
That's a very good choice. Nice. Gold.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.604
Yeah, exactly. It was him. You guys...

15:56.680 --> 15:57.681
Let's go.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.330
How long have you worked here?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.721
Not too long. Is that your dad?

16:08.720 --> 16:12.247
I wish I could say no right now.
I'll be right back.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.604
- Dad?
- Hey!

16:16.680 --> 16:18.648
See you later, Tom and Rita.
You guys are awesome. Take care.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.324
I'll see you at the reception.
I'm not gonna go.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.731
I'm not gonna go. I'm not gonna go.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.371
- Dad, are you spying on me?
- Spying?

16:24.440 --> 16:28.240
- No. No, no, no. I...
- Dad, you're embarrassing me!

16:30.320 --> 16:32.527
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'll leave you alone.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.761
Please.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.681
Blart!

16:38.760 --> 16:40.364
Saul Gundermutt,

16:40.440 --> 16:43.284
head of the Security Officers
Trade Association.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.728
- I catch you at a bad time?
- No. No, no. It's a pleasure, sir.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.086
Pleasure's mine.

16:48.280 --> 16:52.604
And I just want you to know
that I got you sitting at my table tonight.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.769
I got to say, sir, I am just so excited.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.763
I'm gonna be honest, I did hear rumblings.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.807
- Rumblings?
- About the keynote.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.451
Yeah. Well, with good reason.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.726
Nick Panero's giving it.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.046
Great guy, great guy-

17:07.119 --> 17:09.964
Yeah, Nick Panero.
Those were the rumblings.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.008
That is just terrific.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.048
It really is. That's... I'm so happy.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.760
You know, maybe I could
meet him sometime.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.928
- Pick his brain...
- Here's your chance.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.402
Blart, Officer Nick Panero
and Officer Gino Chizetti.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.404
- Hey, Officer Panero.
- Hold the applesauce, hotshot.

17:24.520 --> 17:27.410
I heard of you. Rumor has it you thought
you were giving the keynote tonight.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.369
- He thought he was giving it.
- You thought you were giving it?

17:29.440 --> 17:31.090
- No. You know what, I never said...
- Man, you gotta stop

17:31.160 --> 17:32.969
bringing up that Black Friday thing, Blart.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.088
- It was, like, six years ago.
- You got to let it go.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.049
I never brought up Black Friday.

17:44.160 --> 17:47.403
I heard you're pretty good
on one of those things.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.244
I've been known to dabble.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.688
I... I really shouldn't.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.441
Actually, sir, you can't.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.171
I'll need a valid driver's license
if you want to take it for a test drive.

18:00.240 --> 18:03.562
Yeah, I'm all-access,
if you'll peep the laminate, okay?

18:03.640 --> 18:06.325
Let me just nudge her out of whisper mode.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.364
Okay, well, I see you know
your way around a pl 33.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.011
I do, I do, but this gal's a bit tired.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.525
I got a modified i2 Commuter myself.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.125
Still gonna need a valid license, though.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.611
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.201
How's that? Is that valid enough for you?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.045
That was pretty valid, huh?

18:36.120 --> 18:38.122
- Yeah.
- Please be careful, sir.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.690
It's about weight distribution.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.445
Make sure both your hands
are firmly on the grips.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.762
I guess you wouldn't want me doing this!

18:49.360 --> 18:50.725
- Yeah!
- Please don't.

18:53.720 --> 18:54.767
Missed.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.487
Blart!

18:56.560 --> 18:58.085
- You see that?
- That's not good.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.888
Still got the laminate.

19:09.760 --> 19:13.446
Dad, are you okay?
You should really get checked out.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.000
Pumpkin, my body's fine.

19:16.080 --> 19:18.082
It's my ego that took a hit.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.002
It turns out I'm not giving
the keynote tonight.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.401
Well, you know what?

19:23.480 --> 19:26.723
You should call a cop,
because you got robbed.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.326
Well, thanks, kitten.
Technically, I don't need a cop.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.890
- It's a figure of speech, Daddy.
- No, no, I know.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.691
I'm just saying, you know,
just that cops think they're all that,

19:33.760 --> 19:35.649
and I don't like it.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.441
I do not like it.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.131
Boy. We got a meet-and-greet in 15.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.409
I was wrong! The body does hurt.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.767
Lactic acid!

19:51.120 --> 19:53.441
Honey, you're not even dressed. Come on.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.286
As exciting as that sounds, I think
I'm just gonna take a bath and a nap.

19:57.360 --> 19:58.486
I'm kind of tired.

20:00.360 --> 20:03.603
Okay, yeah. I mean, no, you should...

20:03.720 --> 20:05.802
You should get some rest.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.441
Well, I'll come back
and get you for dinner at Bartolotta,

20:09.560 --> 20:11.369
'cause we got reservations at 6:00.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.165
- It's supposed to be the real deal.
- Gotcha.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.761
Hey. Dad?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.768
I'm really sorry about the speech.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.325
I'll see you later.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.089
I got this one guy against the wall.
He's really sweating. He knows it's over.

20:40.160 --> 20:42.128
Then out of the corner of my eye
I see this other guy,

20:42.200 --> 20:45.329
and then I turn to him
and I say, "Hand over the yogurt."

20:45.400 --> 20:46.970
It was over that fast.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.804
- Lights out.
- Lights out.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.360
Hey, how much you pay for that belt?

20:52.760 --> 20:54.762
I don't know. It was a
gift from my daughter.

20:54.840 --> 20:57.764
You got a guy? 'Cause I got a guy.

20:58.520 --> 21:00.568
No, I don't have a belt guy.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.720
- That's crazy. What, you don't got a belt guy?
- No, I don't have a belt guy.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.530
Khan Mubi. Nice to meet.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.804
Khan Mubi. Nice to meet.

21:08.880 --> 21:10.723
Nice to meet you.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.451
It's been a heck of a day,
and that embrace certainly helped.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.922
So thank you. First one warmed me up,
this one brought it home.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.205
I think you kissed the shoulder.
All right, thank you.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.520
My pleasure.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.610
- Okay.
- It's time to go.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.087
It is. And I think the
doors are open, so...

21:35.480 --> 21:36.561
What's the latest, friend?

21:36.640 --> 21:38.051
The Big Sticky Mess.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.282
A grenade launcher that shoots glue foam.

21:45.320 --> 21:48.324
Marbles. You can't run
with these under your feet.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.765
You can't even stand.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.887
The Vitru Sonic Taser
renders your assailant

21:55.000 --> 21:57.765
incapacitated for five seconds at a time.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.285
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Saul. What you got there?

22:05.360 --> 22:07.567
It's getting revealed
tomorrow at the luncheon.

22:07.680 --> 22:10.081
It's a prototype.
I'm not supposed to show anybody,

22:10.160 --> 22:14.563
but since you're into
gyro-performance vehicles, take a gander.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.761
Things will never be the same.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.360
No!

22:43.440 --> 22:46.091
Are you kidding me? Great.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.607
- Are you okay?
- Thank you so much.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.209
- Okay, here we go.
- Thanks.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.964
- See you.
- Have a good day.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.042
Hey, check it out, guys.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.282
When you want them to pay the price,
you reach for The Finisher.

23:07.360 --> 23:11.160
The most effective non-lethal
beanbag firearm on the market today.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.448
Why don't you give it a spin?

23:13.560 --> 23:15.562
- Me?
- Yeah. It's easy.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.241
Okay.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.050
Laser focus.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.331
Exhale, pull the trigger. Predator.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.730
The adjustments are off on the sight.
I can tell, it's a little off here.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.404
That's the problem.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.727
- Paul Blart, Mall Cop.
- Yes, sir?

23:40.800 --> 23:43.531
Eduardo Furtillo,
head of security of Wynn Las Vegas.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.967
Pleasure to meet a fellow brother-in-arms.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.281
You know, a fun fact for you,
you might not notice,

23:48.360 --> 23:51.842
but Mr. Furtillo here,
being the head of security,

23:51.920 --> 23:53.251
is in a black coat while...

23:53.320 --> 23:55.288
- I'm sorry, son, I didn't get your name.
- Jenkins.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.169
Jenkins is in a purple coat.

23:57.240 --> 24:01.768
See, there's a hierarchy of coat colors
based on their security responsibilities.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.208
Black, gray, pine, and then, last, purple.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.770
Sorry, no offense.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.202
You're wearing a polyester shirt
with Spanx underneath.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.126
Yes. Good catch.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.248
- I see you admiring the non-lethals.
- Yeah.

24:17.320 --> 24:20.449
I guess they don't trust you
with the real stuff?

24:20.560 --> 24:22.562
No, they do, but we choose not to.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.881
I mean, what are you
really guarding anyway?

24:25.480 --> 24:28.086
Cell phone covers and Cinnabon?

24:28.160 --> 24:30.162
There's also three ATMs
and a Dave & Buster's

24:30.280 --> 24:33.250
that just is off the hook after 9:00.
It just gets crazy.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.403
By the way, as a professional courtesy,

24:36.480 --> 24:40.724
I'm happy to keep my eyes peeled for any
irregularities while I'm here, so...

24:40.800 --> 24:42.723
Hey. Closer.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.201
Closer.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.725
Since I was named
head of security five years ago,

24:50.840 --> 24:53.571
we have not had
so much as a towel go missing.

24:53.640 --> 24:56.246
Your mother must be very proud
of your accomplishments.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.371
That got real.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.441
Wow, that was impressive.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.046
Was it me, or did he smell
like tobacco and vanilla?

25:13.120 --> 25:15.202
'Cause I got a... I don't
know if it's cologne...

25:15.280 --> 25:16.441
Let's just get some yogurt.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.371
Maya?

25:28.440 --> 25:30.442
Honey, I've been thinking about the menu,

25:30.520 --> 25:34.127
and I don't care, I'm
going double parm. So...

25:36.160 --> 25:38.049
Sunshine, you still in the tub?

25:39.160 --> 25:40.525
Honey?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.131
Get me security!

25:51.760 --> 25:54.923
That's so cool, you got into UCLA.
You must be stoked!

25:55.440 --> 25:58.444
Not really. I haven't
been able to tell my dad.

25:58.520 --> 26:00.681
Why not? That's huge!
Don't you think he'll be excited?

26:00.720 --> 26:02.245
I don't think he can handle it.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.846
My parents were thrilled when I got my GED.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.571
That is so cool your parents
support you like that.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.529
Yup. Third time was the charm.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.925
I'm not kidding. Was
closer to four, actually.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.885
No. I got to go.
I was supposed to meet my dad for dinner.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.611
- Okay, cool. Maybe I'll see you later.
- Yeah. I hope so.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.681
Yeah, okay.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.802
My daughter's missing.
She's not answering her phone.

26:30.880 --> 26:35.647
Mr. Blart, I want you to know
that we will get to the bottom of this,

26:35.720 --> 26:37.165
despite our differences.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.326
Differences?

26:40.400 --> 26:43.244
We need to establish motive.
Do you have a lot of money?

26:43.320 --> 26:44.810
- Define "a lot." I mean, there's...
- Any.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.611
No. Actually, I don't have a lot, no.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.166
All right, are you an important man?

26:49.240 --> 26:50.880
Well, you know, that depends who you ask.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.206
I got to be honest.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.042
Could this be some domestic situation?

26:56.120 --> 26:57.724
- Your wife got angry?
- I'm not married.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.371
- Your girlfriend found out you...
- No girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.160
- Does anybody love you?
- Yes. My daughter,

27:02.200 --> 27:03.326
and she's been kidnapped.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.481
You know, since she's an adult,

27:04.600 --> 27:06.602
normally we're not gonna file
a missing persons report

27:06.680 --> 27:08.200
till she's gone for at least 24 hours.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.520
Well, let me tell you something.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.291
I've been in the security game
for over 16 years,

27:12.400 --> 27:14.880
and I've seen things
that you would not comprehend.

27:14.960 --> 27:18.521
Understand this.
We are pulling the trigger, boys.

27:18.760 --> 27:22.082
Now, I need you to establish a perimeter
and lock down the premises.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.806
- You going to answer that?
- We're losing precious time!

27:27.200 --> 27:29.885
This is Officer Blart. I
need to keep this line...

27:32.040 --> 27:33.610
Yep. No, no. Okay. I see.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.929
Yes. No, no, I can't... I can't...

27:37.000 --> 27:38.889
I can't talk about it right now.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.962
Okay, okay, okay. Now, we're gonna talk...

27:41.040 --> 27:42.690
We're gonna talk about it later.
We're gonna talk about...

27:42.760 --> 27:44.683
I gotta get going. I'm going.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.966
Yeah, that was my daughter.
She's calling from the restaurant.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.929
She just... She just called.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.729
She's good.

28:07.880 --> 28:10.884
My agents are highly trained professionals

28:11.000 --> 28:13.367
that do not have time to let you play out

28:13.440 --> 28:17.809
your little fantasies
about being a real cop, Mr. Blart.

28:17.880 --> 28:20.406
Totally understand. I get it.
Yeah, you're right.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.768
It is Officer Blart.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.201
Hey, Dad. I ordered your favorite.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.771
Really? Well, you know what?
I've lost my appetite.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.889
What has gotten into you? You lied to me.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.525
You said you were taking a nap.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.649
- Well, I was going to, but...
- You never called me once.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.883
You leave the bath filled,
which could have caused water damage,

29:00.960 --> 29:03.440
candles lit, which could have
burnt down Las Vegas, Nevada.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.330
I'm sorry. It's just that Lane invited me
to go out to the pool...

29:06.400 --> 29:09.051
Lane? Lane?
That's what this betrayal's about?

29:09.120 --> 29:11.600
Chicken Chow Lane?

29:11.680 --> 29:13.728
Dad, people are looking.

29:13.800 --> 29:14.801
What happened to her, Maya?

29:14.880 --> 29:17.611
What happened to the pristine girl
who could never tell a lie?

29:17.680 --> 29:19.569
What happened to
my little George Washington?

29:19.640 --> 29:21.449
- George Washington?
- He could never tell a lie.

29:21.520 --> 29:22.960
He was full truth in a powdered wig.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.010
- I think you're overreacting.
- Really?

29:25.080 --> 29:26.760
And when were you
gonna tell me about that?

29:28.360 --> 29:30.362
- Where did you find this?
- Please, Maya,

29:30.440 --> 29:32.090
I'm a highly trained security specialist.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.128
You can't expect to keep secrets from me.

29:35.480 --> 29:37.323
I didn't think I'd get in.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.248
I didn't even know you applied there.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.891
What happened to Central Jersey
Applied Technical Junior College?

29:42.960 --> 29:45.440
We're talking about UCLA here.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.329
Yeah, I thought
we were talking about CJATJC.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.481
Dad, you don't understand.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.642
I have a chance to go to California.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.611
Maya, California, it's too far away.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.924
Well, think about it this way.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.970
You could come visit me in the wintertime
when it's really cold in Jersey.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.123
Of course I can, if I want some smog
on my earthquake flakes!

30:07.440 --> 30:10.171
You know what? I've decided. I'm going.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.561
Wait, wait. You just decided?

30:12.640 --> 30:15.041
Well, you know what? Decision overruled.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.770
Judge Blart now in session!

30:22.440 --> 30:26.809
I know you've lost a lot lately,
and you're scared,

30:29.560 --> 30:32.769
but what you're doing
right now is so wrong.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.249
I'm going to UCLA.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.889
Maya, Maya, you get back...

30:41.640 --> 30:42.801
Maya.

30:51.080 --> 30:53.401
Paul? I catch you at a bad time?

30:53.480 --> 30:55.050
I want you to meet the wife.

30:56.240 --> 30:58.049
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.043
- Nice to meet you, yeah.
- Are you here with your wife?

31:00.120 --> 31:01.531
- Daughter.
- Yeah.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.810
It's our last trip together
before she goes off to college.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.001
Crusher.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.606
- Gosh, ours just went last year.
- Yeah.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.963
It was just as depressing as Idaho.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.170
Yeah, the silence was unbearable.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.320
I mean, the house was like
a cold tomb of loneliness.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.885
Anyway...

31:20.960 --> 31:22.803
- I would get so sad.
- Honey.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.529
When you would leave for work,

31:26.600 --> 31:29.649
I would just fire up the Sarah McLachlan,
walk into her closet

31:29.720 --> 31:32.087
and smell the sweaters
that she left behind.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.240
Yeah, I smell them. I smell the sweaters.

31:34.280 --> 31:37.363
Well, at least I have
this little angel to get me through.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.440
I mean, can you imagine

31:39.520 --> 31:41.249
- trying to get through it alone?
- No, I couldn't do it.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.240
- Could not do it.
- I could never do that alone.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.082
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.329
Can't wait to meet your wife.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.890
- Yeah, that'd be terrific.
- Yeah.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.327
- Vegas, baby!
- Let's hit the tables!

31:55.960 --> 31:59.009
Have her call me if you want to
get her nails done or whatever.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.206
All right.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.641
Problem?

32:26.120 --> 32:29.886
They've already upgraded the lock
on Mr. Van Gogh to the dual control.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.967
You said the upgrades
weren't scheduled till tomorrow.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.361
Because that is what the
security e-mail said.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.401
Now, I do have a guy on the inside

32:37.440 --> 32:39.841
who was supposed to alert me
if the schedule changed.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.285
Obviously, he didn't.

32:41.680 --> 32:42.806
Options.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.087
We disable both controls
at the exact same moment

32:45.160 --> 32:46.685
with a thermal lance. Now, it can be done,

32:46.760 --> 32:48.444
but that's gonna push us back.

32:49.040 --> 32:53.489
Okay. Let's switch out all the other pieces
before the rest get upgraded.

32:53.560 --> 32:55.164
Then we can focus on the van Gogh.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.961
It's number one on our buyer's list,
and I am not leaving without it.

33:00.560 --> 33:01.925
Everybody listen up.

33:02.720 --> 33:03.801
We're going now.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.520
Now, we're leaving the van Gogh for last,

33:05.560 --> 33:08.131
so Nadia will coordinate the new order.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.488
They say Las Vegas has
the best security in the world.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.449
Well, we're about to find out.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.763
Bring me your guy on the inside.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.884
- What'd I do?
- You don't get it.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.200
- You just do not get it.
- Get what?

33:22.280 --> 33:23.805
I said you had nice hair and nice teeth.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.770
- Officer needs assistance.
- Don't you get it?

33:26.840 --> 33:30.481
You smell like peat moss and curry,
and I think I'm gonna throw up.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.369
You don't want to go out with me?

33:32.440 --> 33:37.241
Whoa. Seems to me like two nice people
are trying to board the peace train,

33:37.320 --> 33:39.004
but she seems to have derailed.

33:39.120 --> 33:44.331
Look, this hairy, drunk rent-a-cop
confused "go away" for "hit on me."

33:44.400 --> 33:46.129
- Hey...
- Ma'am, Officer Panero here,

33:46.200 --> 33:48.646
who, in my professional opinion,
doesn't seem drunk,

33:48.720 --> 33:51.405
has at least three years' training
in distress recognition.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.802
I'm sure he sensed that
an attractive lady sitting by herself

33:54.880 --> 33:57.360
most likely seemed a bit lonely.

33:58.440 --> 34:02.047
So before you retreat
behind that wall we all put up,

34:02.120 --> 34:06.489
just know that Officer Panero
was here for you.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.324
Maybe I overreacted.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.726
And he's giving the keynote tonight.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.402
- Pleasure to be here.
- He's blotto.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.880
Sort of like someone's mother
last Columbus Day.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.286
Will you let it go? It
was a half box of wine.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.445
She's very patriotic.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.603
Well, there's no way Panero can go on.

34:29.679 --> 34:33.810
We need a leader right now that can
step up, take the reins and inspire us.

34:33.880 --> 34:34.927
I understand.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.561
I tried contacting Officer Ferguson from
TSA, but he must have his phone off.

34:38.679 --> 34:39.806
I mean, my hands are tied.

34:51.840 --> 34:52.841
Paul?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.806
Can you step up to the plate and save us?

35:00.360 --> 35:02.601
I'm gonna need my dress whites.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.681
Come on.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.042
- Your uniform, as requested, Officer Blart.
- Thank you very much.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.131
Here you go.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.966
I am the general manager of this resort,
so I don't take tips.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.202
And I don't normally deliver
dry cleaning either,

35:36.320 --> 35:38.129
but I just... I wanted to clarify

35:38.240 --> 35:40.811
that I was not making advances
towards you earlier,

35:40.880 --> 35:42.962
nor would I, ever.

35:44.440 --> 35:48.081
Look, I understand you have
no control over this.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.484
Integrity is a bewitching gumbo,

35:51.560 --> 35:54.848
but I'm preparing now, internally,
to give the keynote.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.570
So if you don't mind, okay?

35:57.560 --> 35:59.642
Look, this is crazy.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.402
I'm actually dating someone.

36:02.480 --> 36:06.166
Please, ma'am, I practically invented
the fake boyfriend thing.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.401
What?

36:07.480 --> 36:11.041
Listen, you have no bearing
on my life whatsoever.

36:12.280 --> 36:15.363
Your lip is sweating. It's sweating.

36:46.440 --> 36:50.161
There is an audience out there
of security professionals

36:50.240 --> 36:54.325
that paid good money to hear you speak.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.885
They want to hear you.

36:55.960 --> 36:59.965
That's not true. They didn't pay anything,
but they do deserve your best.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.724
They deserve it. They deserve it.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.404
Yeah, come on, man.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.642
Just loosen up, baby, loosen up.

37:06.480 --> 37:09.131
Coming at you! I'm gonna be coming.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.043
Bring it to them, bring it to them.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.249
I'm getting tight. I'm getting tight.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.970
I can't breathe, man.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.651
That's orange chicken.

37:27.720 --> 37:29.848
What am I gonna say? What am I gonna say?

37:29.920 --> 37:32.924
I got to get air. I got to
get air, I got to get air.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.604
I got to get some air.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.284
I got to get air, I got to get air.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.931
This is nice.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.968
And pulse back in range.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.046
Okay.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.125
Thank you.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.251
Get out of here.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.201
All right.

38:19.120 --> 38:21.282
Hey! Nope, nope, move along.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.649
Get away. Move along.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.925
Get away from me. Hefeweizen!

38:42.680 --> 38:44.045
Get out of here!

38:48.000 --> 38:49.365
Get out of here.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.880
Get out!

39:09.600 --> 39:10.761
My God!

39:16.760 --> 39:18.603
Is there someone you can call?

39:24.280 --> 39:26.328
Can you help me? Can you call backup?

39:33.920 --> 39:35.809
I hurt my neck, I hurt my neck.

39:36.720 --> 39:37.801
Okay.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.405
Hey, thanks for all your help.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.849
There you are.

39:52.920 --> 39:55.207
- We're about to announce you.
- Okay.

39:55.880 --> 39:56.927
Come on, Maya.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.210
Thanks.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.123
Cool party. Whose suite is this?

40:05.200 --> 40:07.089
The housekeepers are
all good friends of mine.

40:07.160 --> 40:10.084
They let me know when the high rollers
check out early, so...

40:11.560 --> 40:14.484
- You okay?
- Yeah. Everything's great.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.924
I'll be right back. I
got something for you.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.650
I think you're gonna like it.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.446
Yeah!

40:33.520 --> 40:34.760
Very kind, very kind.

40:34.840 --> 40:38.561
Ladies and gentlemen,
I know you're here to see Nick Panero

40:38.640 --> 40:40.608
deliver the keynote speech.

40:40.680 --> 40:45.208
However, due to circumstances
beyond our control,

40:45.280 --> 40:48.170
we've had to bring in
a different speaker tonight.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.082
Yeah, I know, I'm disappointed, too.

40:51.920 --> 40:56.209
So, instead, how about
a nice, warm Expo welcome

40:56.280 --> 40:58.726
for Officer Paul Blart.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.441
Thank you, Officer Gundermutt.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.206
Is it warm in here,

41:15.280 --> 41:18.568
or am I ordering my next uniform
from Rochester Big and Humid?

41:26.560 --> 41:29.962
I am honored to be here,

41:30.040 --> 41:32.168
in the presence of the
greats from the past.

41:33.560 --> 41:38.407
Just looking at these faces reminds me
of the questions so many people ask.

41:39.320 --> 41:40.685
Why do we do it?

41:41.760 --> 41:44.525
Why walk a beat
knowing that on a typical day

41:44.600 --> 41:47.683
you'll get zero pats on the back?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.011
But you know what you will get?

41:52.080 --> 41:53.923
A whole lot of ridicule.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.364
What are you doing here?

41:57.440 --> 41:59.283
I thought Mini Kiss was playing.

42:00.320 --> 42:01.560
What are you doing here?

42:01.640 --> 42:04.166
I get it. We're easy targets.

42:04.240 --> 42:08.689
People call us heavy, skinny, lumpy.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.683
They point out our bad skin.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.401
What is it that we all have in common?

42:25.880 --> 42:27.644
In the words of Joseph Conrad,

42:27.720 --> 42:31.167
who wrote some really long books
about sailing and stuff,

42:32.680 --> 42:35.160
"We live as we dream.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.530
"Alone."

42:49.000 --> 42:51.526
<i>Turns out I am giving</i>
the keynote after all,

42:51.600 --> 42:54.206
<i>so it'd mean a lot</i>
if you could be there, peanut.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.085
You were supposed to tell me

43:07.160 --> 43:08.525
- if the schedule got moved.
- Let's calm down.

43:08.600 --> 43:10.170
And no one told me anything.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.050
I'm sorry. Bye.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.251
Get her.

43:21.400 --> 43:24.131
And yet, when people ask me,
"Why do you do it?"

43:24.200 --> 43:25.611
I have to laugh.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.929
'Cause they think I have a choice.

43:31.240 --> 43:32.526
I don't.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.568
I, like you, didn't choose security.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.849
Security chose me!

43:50.160 --> 43:54.449
Every morning, I pull my pants on
one leg at a time,

43:54.520 --> 43:56.170
and I slip on my soft-soled shoes,

43:56.240 --> 43:58.083
and I hear the same calling you do.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.041
"Help someone today."

44:07.160 --> 44:08.207
Come on, Dad.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.450
"Help someone today."

44:14.520 --> 44:16.124
Sounds easy, doesn't it?

44:16.960 --> 44:20.407
But if being a security officer was easy,
anybody could do it.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.086
Anyone can do it.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.244
Takes a certain breed.

44:25.640 --> 44:29.247
Someone who has Spidey-senses
when things are going wrong.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.129
Sure, you can meet all kinds of people
in this line of work.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.964
Your shoplifters, your pickpockets,

44:37.400 --> 44:39.164
your freeloaders

44:39.280 --> 44:42.602
stealing a nap in
a Brookstone massage chair.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.843
- They're the worst.
- Don't get me started.

44:44.920 --> 44:48.527
And there's the old lady
who can't find her car in Parking Level F

44:48.600 --> 44:51.490
'cause she doesn't have a car.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.449
And there is no Parking Level F.

44:57.960 --> 44:59.803
It only goes up to D.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.520
And all of a sudden you're asking yourself,

45:05.640 --> 45:08.291
"Why do I do it?"

45:15.440 --> 45:20.367
Till the little boy, tears in his eyes,
is tugging on your sleeve.

45:22.280 --> 45:24.487
He says to you,

45:25.360 --> 45:27.522
"Mister, mister, mister.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.169
"Can't find my mommy."

45:39.160 --> 45:40.924
That's why you do it.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.161
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.569
I Will close with this.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.690
If you believe the purpose of life
is to only serve yourself,

45:48.760 --> 45:50.922
then you have no purpose.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.401
Help someone today!

45:59.840 --> 46:01.524
- Jackpot!
- You nailed it! You nailed it!

46:01.600 --> 46:03.284
Way to 90, Blart!

46:03.360 --> 46:05.169
You go, Paul Blart!

46:16.840 --> 46:18.649
Maya, look, I know you're mad at me.

46:18.720 --> 46:20.768
<i>- Dad!</i>
- But hear me out.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.121
<i>- Look, I feel just terrible.</i>
- I <i>need</i> your <i>help!</i>

46:23.200 --> 46:25.362
Yeah, and I need your help.
This is what I'm trying to say.

46:25.440 --> 46:28.205
Dad!
I saw something in the Presidential Suite

46:28.280 --> 46:29.850
I guess I wasn't supposed to see.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.809
<i>- And now they're after me.</i>
- Who?

46:31.880 --> 46:32.881
I don't know.

46:32.960 --> 46:36.407
Angel, please don't worry.
I know exactly what you're dealing with.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.369
It was just somebody
trying to intimidate you.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.084
Trust me, they're all bark and no bite.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.527
They're coming for me!

46:43.200 --> 46:44.929
Misread it. Okay, sweetheart.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.650
Stay on the phone with me. I'm on my way!

46:49.680 --> 46:51.170
Maya, use your pepper spray!

46:52.760 --> 46:54.649
<i>Maya, Maya, what's happening?</i>

46:55.280 --> 46:56.520
Maya?

46:57.640 --> 46:59.802
- Maya!
- Thank you.

46:59.920 --> 47:02.002
- Who <i>is this?</i>
- This is Officer Paul Blart

47:02.080 --> 47:04.162
from the West Orange Pavilion Mall.
Who am I speaking with?

47:04.240 --> 47:05.401
Don't you worry about that.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.640
Well, that's not fair.
I already told you my name.

47:07.720 --> 47:10.564
- Now, where's my daughter?
- Your daughter.

47:10.680 --> 47:13.490
Wow, you don't know when to
shut your mouth, do you?

47:13.600 --> 47:15.568
Listen, I don't think you have a clue
to who you're messing with.

47:15.640 --> 47:18.689
Actually, I don't need a clue.
You just told me.

47:18.760 --> 47:21.445
And if you decide to go to the real cops,

47:21.520 --> 47:24.281
attempt to track this cell phone
or make any attempt to come after me,

47:24.320 --> 47:26.129
boy, I am so crazy,

47:26.200 --> 47:28.851
I'll put you and your daughter
in a world of pain.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.528
Yeah? Well, here's a few things
you don't know about me.

47:32.600 --> 47:35.331
First off, pain is my copilot,
so no problem there.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.606
And second off...

47:41.200 --> 47:43.123
Hello. Hello?

47:46.880 --> 47:49.121
Hello? Hello?

47:50.960 --> 47:53.281
Strange. Okay, let's go.

47:53.800 --> 47:54.881
Get rid of this.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.323
Hey, Yo, have you guys seen Maya?

47:57.400 --> 48:00.324
- Who's Maya?
- I introduced you to her.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.402
She was the girl
I was talking to right over there.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.245
Dude, he's hammered.
She was on the phone and went that way.

48:05.360 --> 48:06.600
- That way?
- Yeah.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.521
Enjoy-

48:13.320 --> 48:14.446
Maya?

48:16.840 --> 48:18.285
Maya?

48:21.000 --> 48:22.525
Maya?

48:23.160 --> 48:24.810
Looking for someone?

48:30.520 --> 48:32.249
Okay, clear this place out.

48:32.320 --> 48:34.368
This location's been compromised.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.488
Bring those two to the villa.

48:42.360 --> 48:43.805
<i>Sugar.</i>

48:44.640 --> 48:45.641
<i>Sugar.</i>

48:49.040 --> 48:51.611
Daddy, look at the beautiful flowers.
Can I draw on them?

48:51.680 --> 48:54.286
Not now, honey. Daddy's on the phone.
Go with Mommy.

48:55.600 --> 49:00.766
Must get sugar.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.770
Come on, sugar.

50:05.160 --> 50:06.525
- Please, sir, please.
- Just let us out.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.602
We're not gonna cause any trouble.
We're not gonna say anything.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.842
- Please, sir. Please.
- Sir, please let us out!

50:13.360 --> 50:16.204
- What the heck is going on?
- I think they're stealing art from the hotel.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.601
- From the what?
- From the hotel.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.841
- What is that?
- I got this for you.

50:24.080 --> 50:26.560
Here. It's either this or sunblock.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.527
Maya.

50:45.640 --> 50:49.201
Have sweet mercy! Oh, my!

50:52.520 --> 50:53.885
I am so sorry, ma'am.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.440
Nope, my fault. I startled you.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.402
- I just feel terrible.
- No. I deserved it.

51:00.480 --> 51:03.563
Can I help you up
or get you some medical attention?

51:03.640 --> 51:04.721
Not necessary.

51:04.800 --> 51:08.486
This just shifts the focus
away from my arthritis.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.844
- You're sure?
- I'm fine.

51:17.240 --> 51:21.086
- Are you gonna want turndown service?
- No, thank you!

51:22.960 --> 51:24.610
Officer, how can I help you?

51:24.680 --> 51:26.569
I need to know who's staying
in your Presidential Suite.

51:26.640 --> 51:28.801
Okay, first of all,
you need to slow things down a bit.

51:28.840 --> 51:31.207
And, secondly, that's actually
against resort policy. So...

51:31.280 --> 51:32.281
I got this, Heath.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.402
Sir, I can help you down here.

51:36.760 --> 51:39.001
Well, I guess I've been overruled.

51:42.960 --> 51:43.961
Now, what can I do for you?

51:44.040 --> 51:47.487
I need information on who's staying
in your Presidential Suite. It's urgent.

51:47.560 --> 51:50.086
- What's going on?
- I can't divulge that at this moment.

51:50.160 --> 51:52.049
It's top secret stuff, okay? Just...

51:52.800 --> 51:54.404
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Blart,

51:54.480 --> 51:56.847
but, unfortunately, I won't be able
to give you that information,

51:56.920 --> 51:58.365
because it is against protocol.

51:59.440 --> 52:02.250
See? I told you I feel
no admiration for you,

52:02.320 --> 52:05.529
so sorry, there are no special favors.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.123
You're breathing in double time.

52:09.200 --> 52:10.521
Just tell me who's staying there.

52:12.360 --> 52:14.203
I can't say no to you.

52:16.400 --> 52:19.290
He's a high roller who books his rooms
through his company.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.010
Norbertine Shipping
out of Hamburg, Germany.

52:21.080 --> 52:22.206
Shipping. Thank you.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.611
You're so...

52:27.240 --> 52:28.924
Come on. No.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.128
I think I can short this
and get us out of here.

53:20.800 --> 53:23.849
Or maybe we should just do what they say.

53:23.920 --> 53:27.083
We've seen what they look like, Lane.
They're not gonna let us go.

53:39.960 --> 53:41.644
- Can I help you?
- Hey.

53:45.200 --> 53:46.531
Muhrtelle.

53:46.840 --> 53:49.446
It's pronounced like "turtle" or "girdle."

53:49.520 --> 53:52.205
No, Muhrtelle. I got it right away.
I'm pretty good.

53:52.280 --> 53:55.409
- Why are you back here?
- No, I'm from shipping, so...

53:56.640 --> 53:58.130
- I'm from shipping.
- Yeah, I know.

53:58.200 --> 54:01.409
I'm from corporate, so...

54:01.480 --> 54:04.165
If you could give me a moment,
I'd like to place a telephone call.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.368
No, no, no, no. No need, really.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.761
Okay, actually, I'm...

54:08.840 --> 54:11.764
I'm from Internal Affairs Shipping. Yeah.

54:11.840 --> 54:15.606
Corporate sent me here to check up
on you and your coworkers.

54:15.680 --> 54:18.445
Random selection.
No need to get too nervous.

54:18.520 --> 54:21.808
- Is it okay I eat my lunch?
- Sure, yeah. You might as well.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.644
I'm just gonna fire
some questions at you, though,

54:23.720 --> 54:26.291
vis-a-vis this particular shipment here.

54:26.360 --> 54:27.566
Now, where exactly did...

54:27.640 --> 54:30.610
Wow, that is the brownest banana
I've ever seen.

54:30.680 --> 54:33.401
That's borderline black. I wouldn't
eat that if I were you. That's...

54:33.440 --> 54:35.329
You're eating it. He's eating it.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.323
I'm gonna throw up a little bit, I think.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.250
I think that's poison.

54:41.920 --> 54:43.206
That's sickening.

54:47.760 --> 54:49.728
Where did this ship from?

54:50.320 --> 54:52.360
I don't know.
Some man brought a bunch of these down

54:52.400 --> 54:54.209
from the Presidential Suite.

54:54.880 --> 54:56.928
You mind opening it for me?

54:59.640 --> 55:00.971
Internal Affairs, so I just...

55:06.720 --> 55:08.370
Do you have any identification?

55:08.760 --> 55:09.966
Don't you worry about that, Turtle.

55:10.040 --> 55:12.361
- I'll ask the questions here.
- Wait.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.204
I want to ask a question.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.525
What do you think
you're doing with that crate?

55:18.600 --> 55:20.682
I was just simply just checking that...

55:28.400 --> 55:30.721
- Someone's messing with the shipment!
- Radio.

55:31.840 --> 55:33.888
Unacceptable. Kill him.

55:39.120 --> 55:40.610
A mall.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.842
Home-court advantage.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.566
Bingo.

56:36.640 --> 56:37.641
Pain!

56:52.880 --> 56:55.121
This is it. I'm going down.

57:02.560 --> 57:03.766
Took care of some cop.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.081
- For <i>good?</i>
- Don't worry about it. He's gone.

57:06.520 --> 57:09.091
He sleeps with the fishes. Literally.

57:09.480 --> 57:10.527
Excellent.

57:16.640 --> 57:19.849
Not today, death! Not today!

57:26.280 --> 57:27.486
Sir.

57:28.960 --> 57:31.327
We ask that guests dry off
before entering the casino.

57:31.400 --> 57:33.528
Absolutely. I should have thought of that.

57:33.600 --> 57:35.284
Why don't you come with me, sir.
I'll get you a dry towel.

57:35.360 --> 57:36.725
That would be great.

57:38.240 --> 57:42.643
On second thought, I think
I'd rather air-dry.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.926
Because you're not who you say you are...

57:47.640 --> 57:49.051
Ramos.

57:49.640 --> 57:50.721
Excuse me?

57:51.080 --> 57:53.401
The buttons on your
uniform are rivet brass,

57:53.480 --> 57:55.482
made by Cintas uniform supply,

57:55.560 --> 57:58.370
which stopped using
that particular type of metal,

57:58.440 --> 58:01.489
due to humanitarian reasons, 18 years ago.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.528
Since there's no way you're a day over 30,

58:04.600 --> 58:06.807
and the Security Association
restricts the hiring

58:06.920 --> 58:08.365
of anybody under the age of 18,

58:08.440 --> 58:12.240
there is no way you are
a security guard here.

58:13.800 --> 58:14.926
You're right.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.200
Headbutt!

58:18.520 --> 58:20.648
That's a very good defense. One more!

58:21.000 --> 58:23.241
I'm definitely done. Not this time!

58:24.160 --> 58:26.686
- That was the last one. You have my word.
- All right.

58:29.320 --> 58:30.765
Hey, what's going on?

58:33.480 --> 58:36.802
- Hey. Sorry. Guy's drunk.
- Well, Why'd you let him run off?

58:36.880 --> 58:39.281
- I'll make sure I get him back to his room.
- You do that.

58:45.520 --> 58:47.249
Security's been breached.

58:48.440 --> 58:50.010
Of course.

58:50.080 --> 58:52.048
Eduardo's in on it.

58:52.120 --> 58:54.168
Fool me once, shame on me.

58:54.240 --> 58:57.084
Fool me twice, shame on me.

58:57.880 --> 59:00.167
No, that's me twice. That doesn't work.

59:00.840 --> 59:01.887
Hey!

59:29.960 --> 59:31.450
Gosh. Come on.

59:45.920 --> 59:47.001
Hey!

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.330
That's Paul Blart.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.363
- I'd love to see you up there.
- I would if I had a good hamstring.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.360
- I don't got a good hamstring.
- It's all right.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.049
Who is this guy? What's going on?

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.849
Sorry. Big man on a rope!

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.047
Sorry.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:04.006
This whole thing's like a pool inside,
like an indoor pool.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.127
- It's unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.170
Take a dip! Yeah!

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:12.730
Yeah! Sorry. Tuck and roll.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:17.126
This ain't real.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.445
Thank you, Paul!

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.127
What a guy!

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.120
Come on, man. I know you're in here.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.841
Okay.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.290
It looks like we've come
to a fork in the road.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.361
What?

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.601
A little too much club.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.446
Okay.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:13.685
There you go.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.561
Yeah.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.644
<i>- Ramos, it's Henk. Where are you?</i>
- Le RÃªve theater.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.245
Some cop may be onto us.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:37.165
Wait. Big guy? Mustache? Snug pants?

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.402
<i>- Yeah, that's the one.</i>
- I thought he was dead.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.642
- This guy's like a cockroach.
- Where are <i>you?</i>

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.051
<i>We're about to move the Botero.</i>

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.167
Roger that.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.846
Henk, Ramos, Botero.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.160
Who are these guys?

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.488
Come on, Paul, think for Maya. Think!

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.409
<i>All this for stupid art.</i>

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.845
Who is Art?

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.924
Come on, think.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:10.130
Windershins! It's about the art!

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.402
They're stealing art from the hotel!

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.328
Ramos, this is Henk.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.761
Did you get the new locations yet?

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.481
Henk, you didn't tell me where you are.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.489
We're in the casino. Stop calling me.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:25.201
<i>- Vincent wants you, out.</i>
- Let the games <i>begin.</i>

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.806
Found our friend.

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.288
Didn't see it. Didn't see it.

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.850
That's clean glass. Okay.

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.801
- So?
- I'm gonna need about 20 minutes, Vincent.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.765
Move as fast as you can.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.290
No, no, no!

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.487
Vincent. Vincent, this is Henk.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.166
- Where are <i>you?</i>
- Waiting for the van Gogh. Where are you?

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.770
I'm on my way.

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.205
I'm coming for you, Maya.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.849
Could you press one, please?

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.882
- Good crowd tonight?
- Yeah.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.287
- Did you guys play <i>Bet"?</i>
- No.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.723
- Great hair.
- Thanks. It's not mine.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:07.210
- Told you we should play <i>Beth.</i>
- Not now, Frank!

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.166
This hotel is solid.

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:17.251
This gift is adorable, but...

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.324
The globe lights up with copper wiring.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.244
My father insists that I keep
an extra phone battery on me.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.246
Stand back.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.411
That should do it.

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.886
Come on.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.567
<i>The helicopter is fueled and ready.</i>

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.564
Perfect. What are you doing?

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.449
From the hotel gift basket.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.969
- What is that in your hand?
- Oatmeal cookie.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.168
I'm deathly allergic.
What are you trying to do to me?

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.805
- Sorry.
- Get rid of it.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.125
- Double back.
- Doubling.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.489
We can't get out through there.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.762
- Pocketknife keychain. Just in case.
- In case what?

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.241
I get kidnapped by bad guys
and held hostage.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.607
- It's happened before.
- What?

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.128
Room 3402. Charge it, please.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.489
- Hey! Can you help us?
- Absolutely.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.451
Five more minutes, Vincent,
and then we are done.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.289
Secure the painting and
let's get out of here.

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.488
We've got less than three hours
to meet our buyer.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.006
Roger that.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.085
All right, Vincent,
since you took something precious from me,

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.890
I'm taking something precious from you.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.367
It's a bad day to be bad people.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.688
Paul, <i>mi</i> amor!

01:09:12.399 --> 01:09:13.731
No!

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.207
<i>- Van Gogh is traveling.</i>
- Excellent.

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:36.850
I want the truck waiting
in JuÃ©rez in one hour.

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.607
Yeah!

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.285
Enjoy the ride.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.206
See you.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.730
Where's that phone?

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.961
Come on.

01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:02.211
- Please tell me Blart is dead.
- Yeah, if <i>by</i> dead, you mean

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.924
taking out your crew one by one,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.844
and being in possession
of one of your prize paintings.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.607
- Which one?
- I'm gonna say...

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.809
- I don't know, sunflowers?
- That's a van <i>Gogh,</i> you <i>idiot.</i>

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.885
Yeah, you know what? Well, it's van gone
if you don't ramp down the hurtful words.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.602
- What do you want?
- I want to make a <i>deal.</i>

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.648
A swap. A trade.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.203
Suggesting we make an exchange.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.443
<i>- You see, I have the painting...</i>
- I <i>got it.</i>

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.807
<i>Meet me at the Grand Hall, alone.</i>

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:35.081
Time to even the playing field.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.125
Come on, man.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.205
I'm sorry.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.481
You know what?

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.130
I made my decision.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.170
If we live, I'm not going to UCLA.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.889
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.286
I can't abandon him.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.643
He's never been alone.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.291
We've always lived with my grandma.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.249
Until a milk truck took
her to a better place.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.568
And then there was
those six days of marriage.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.800
I mean, he still sleeps with a night light.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.887
Really?

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.770
- Is that bad?
- No.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.683
No, a lot of people are like that.

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.524
Yeah, a lot of six-year-olds.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.806
You, come with me.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.211
Have Robinson take him to the helipad.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.441
- Let's go.
- Maya.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.601
Let's go!

01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:31.683
- That's far enough.
- Maya, you okay?

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:34.247
I'm okay.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.446
Well done, Blart.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.488
You thinned my manpower significantly.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.921
Must be getting pretty...

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.203
Lonely out there.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.481
You scared?

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.287
Not following you.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.522
Your fear of being alone.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.289
- First your wife dumps you at the altar.
- Wrong.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.124
- She was with me six days.
- Great.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.969
So she got to sample the merchandise

01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:56.530
and was glad she kept her receipt.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.081
And then your mom

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.281
kisses a bus.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.568
It was a milk truck, but
I'll give you that one.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.804
And now your daughter can't wait
to get away from you.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.041
That's not true, Dad.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:11.446
Well, she's following her destiny,
and I support it fully.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.491
Flag on the play, sloppy.

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.122
She says you can't be alone

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.722
and that you're doing everything
in your pathetic power

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.245
to keep her under your thumb.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.290
- I didn't say that exactly, Dad.
- It's okay, sweetheart.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.365
See, Vincent, I'm fiercely independent,

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.647
yet I'm not a big fan of being alone.

01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.486
I'm a contradiction.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.051
I told you I was crazy.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:40.808
And I told you that I'm crazy.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:43.805
You can't out-crazy me.

01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.406
My crazy will take your crazy,
shove it in a metal tube,

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.448
fill it with rats, then blowtorch it

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:51.683
until the rats have no way to escape
except eating their way through your crazy.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.286
Wow. You are oblivious
to the avalanche of insanity

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:56.486
I am about to unload.

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.925
You don't know what I will do to you!

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.525
You don't know what I'll do to you!

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.922
I will spin around until I throw up on you
and your friends.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.451
I simply don't care!

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.569
I'll stick your face in maple syrup
and make you sing gospel!

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.130
How does that blow your hair back, Blart?

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.249
I will crawl inside you
and lay eggs like a baby spider!

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.367
I welcome it!

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.090
I've got two different colored eyes!

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.400
Shows you how I live my life!

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.926
I will bring a folk guitar
to a pumpkin fight,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.207
because that's the way I was brought up!

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.490
Okay, you lost me on that last one.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.688
Because that's how crazy I am!

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.000
Now, give me back my daughter!

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.525
Give me my painting!

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.920
Pick it up. Pick it up before he ruins it.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.726
Get back!

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:51.483
Did you honestly think
that I was gonna be thwarted

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.770
by some sweaty,
sluggish non-entity like yourself?

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.730
"Non-entity."

01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.360
See, I knew you couldn't be trusted,

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.880
so I took out an insurance policy.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.366
Allow me to introduce you
to a few of my associates.

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.085
Gino Chizetti,

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:10.845
Staten Island Industrial Complex.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.003
Saul Gundermutt,

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:15.686
Philadelphia Farmers' Market.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.610
Khan Mubi,

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.523
King's Landing Walmart.

01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.003
And last but not least,

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.727
Donna Ericone, Mall of freaking America.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.130
You got to... You got to fan out, guys.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.641
He can't see you.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.364
Fan it out, fan it out.

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.489
You have your own superhero.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.686
What's with the cape?

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.081
Why are you wearing a cape, Khan?

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.770
I came straight from a haircut.

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.170
Vincent, you just don't get it, do you?

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.566
Fool me once, shame on you.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.041
Fool me twice, shame on me.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.406
Are you sure about that?

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.165
You see, I have a little
insurance policy of my own.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.047
See, I thought I took
all of you out, what...

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.171
Non-lethal. I get it now.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.566
Shame on you.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.441
We are trained to detect, deter,
observe, and report.

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.764
But one day, six years ago,
a man did more than that.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.003
And I am that man!

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:53.684
We are that man!

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.850
And so I say to you, sir...

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.485
Foot Locker!

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.209
Give me the gun. Finish them. Go!

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.680
There's a lip on that carpet.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.690
Someone's gonna have to call that in,
get that changed, okay?

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.048
Foot Locker!

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.401
Dad!

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:58.930
I'm going to the helipad!

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.921
Saul! Help me! Help me!

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.321
Get back here.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.530
What? What?

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.360
- Oh, no.
- You couldn't stay out of the way, could you?

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.562
Eduardo, I knew you were part of this.

01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.047
How is it a man like you
could win the heart

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.805
of a woman like Divina?

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.288
What are you talking about?
My daughter's been kidnapped!

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.407
- Come on, man!
- Look!

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.080
We'll never get to them on time.

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.245
Hey, Blart. I heard you
need a little backup.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.722
Fun fact for you, there's
no helipad up here.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.684
But there is over there.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.206
Got it.

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.091
We don't have much time.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.602
- Thanks, Nick.
- No hard feelings.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.283
Hold on, Paul!

01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:56.203
Oh, boy.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:04.122
Do not look down!

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.011
Don't look up, either!

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.611
Knot jump!

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.160
Coming in hot!

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:25.485
Dad. Come on.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.161
Hey!

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.565
You finish loading. I'll finish this.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.166
UP YOU go, missy.

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.207
All right, guys. Who took my show hair?

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.689
I think Maya's just seen her future.

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.765
Nice punch.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.566
Now, don't move.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.450
You don't move.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.764
Looks like we got ourselves
a sticky situation.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.207
That doesn't sound like something
that can be fixed here.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.850
- You done?
- I am.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.081
Great. So am I.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.809
Oatmeal!

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.767
Always bet on Blart.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.726
Dad!

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.922
<i>So Paul Blart hadn't</i>
officially peaked after all.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.486
<i>Eduardo and I got past our differences.</i>

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.530
<i>I told him that if he ever wanted to go</i>
where the real action was,

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:42.683
<i>there would always be a job for him</i>
at the West Orange Pavilion Mall.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.121
Officer Blart.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.609
<i>He turned me down immediately.</i>

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.163
<i>But I did get to meet the man himself...</i>

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.207
Mr. Wynn.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.329
<i>Who was appreciative</i>
that I saved his art collection.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.531
<i>Very appreciative.</i>

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.611
Holy crawfish!

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:03.367
<i>With ail things going my way,</i>
I figured it was time to make a decision

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.727
<i>that would change my life forever.</i>

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.881
Paul?

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.721
You...

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.570
- Look at me now.
- Yeah, okay.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.722
You are a fearless man,

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.801
a loving father, a strange,

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.725
misshapen superhero.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.201
- Thank you.
- And my heart is yours.

01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.691
Okay, Divina, listen very intently.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.445
Some people think that holding on
is what makes one strong.

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.564
But in reality,

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.011
our only power is in letting go.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.045
But I love...

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.210
That's just it.

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:39.201
See, it's easy to fall in love,
but hard to find someone to catch you.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.486
Besides,

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.121
you don't love me.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.161
- But I...
- What you love is the mystery.

01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:46.765
That's all I am to you.

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.683
You know, I'm a lone cowboy.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.205
A renegade.

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.850
A Rocky Mountain steed.

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.649
But truth be told, Divina,
I'm none of those things.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.410
I'm a simple man.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.765
Now, the qualities you
seek, they're in him.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.610
That man, sitting right over there.
That man,

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.561
just longing to catch...
He's crying right now, isn't he?

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:11.251
Yep, he's Crying-

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.045
That's a full-on cry.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.602
But he's the real deal, Divina.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:19.286
He swung in on a rope
like a knight in shining armor,

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.045
and he rescued my daughter and me,
and he loves you.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.125
Now, go to him.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.041
Go.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:30.370
You're right.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.882
But don't kid yourself, Paul Blart.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.561
You are a Rocky Mountain steed.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.251
That actually felt really good.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.402
I might have made a colossal mistake.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.887
Colossal.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.570
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.929
<i>to commemorate his long career</i>
of undying loyalty,

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.686
<i>honor, and acts of heroism,</i>

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.766
<i>above and beyond the call of duty,</i>

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.041
<i>twice,</i>

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:11.570
<i>the Security Officers Trade Association</i>

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.971
<i>its highest</i>

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.247
<i>and, really, only award,</i>

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.402
<i>the Safety Medal of Honor.</i>

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.890
<i>The road of life is hard.</i>

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:25.121
<i>But once you reach the top,</i>
the view is amazing.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.725
Look, I've given it a lot of thought.

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:47.920
And I'm gonna be really happy

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.281
at Central Jersey Applied
Technical Junior College.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.046
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.043
So they don't have a football team

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.485
OF a campus.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.766
I mean, who cares?

01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:59.650
The last couple of days
really reracked my priorities.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.326
Well, if you want to stay home
with me and keep me company,

01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.847
maybe for a year or two until I
get settled, then I have to say,

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.560
I think you're crazy.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.684
You're going to UCLA.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.130
And, besides...

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:18.926
Holy crawfish!

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.208
That's exactly what I said. I said that.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.162
Now, go. Have fun.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.166
Not too much fun.

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.131
All right.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:44.565
<i>But as for this renegade,</i>
some of us are meant to ride alone.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:49.051
<i>All by "UL...</i>

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.526
<i>What do we have here?</i>

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.205
- Hey!
- Sorry.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.165
You know what you just did?

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.810
You jaywalked in a business district, sir.

01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:36.928
Actually, it's "officer."

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.971
I apologize.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:44.362
I should've recognized the steely-eyed gaze
of a fellow brother-in-arms.

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.124
You're still giving me a ticket?

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.281
Nope.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.685
I'm gonna give you my phone number.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.042
In case you want to grab a drink sometime.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.567
I don't drink.

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:01.485
But I do ride!

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:11.961
- Are you okay?
- Nope.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.368
But I've never been better.
