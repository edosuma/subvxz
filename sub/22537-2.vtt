00:00.461 --> 00:02.282
<i>Previously on</i> The Lost Room...

00:02.283 --> 00:03.049
What's this?

00:03.050 --> 00:06.471
<i>Joe Miller has just found a key
to a room unlike any other.</i>

00:06.473 --> 00:08.271
What if it resets while we're in there?

00:08.272 --> 00:09.889
As long as we have the key, we're safe.

00:09.890 --> 00:11.833
<i>A room that can take you
around the world</i>

00:11.986 --> 00:14.290
- We can go anywhere?
- Anywhere with a door I think.

00:14.291 --> 00:16.737
<i>and gives power to everything inside.</i>

00:16.738 --> 00:18.163
It's an object.

00:18.557 --> 00:19.808
One of many.

00:19.809 --> 00:21.757
- How many are there?
- About a hundred at least.

00:21.758 --> 00:22.986
You can't break an object.

00:23.447 --> 00:26.474
- And do they all...
- They do weird stuff.

00:26.475 --> 00:29.458
Some people think
that these things are...

00:29.480 --> 00:31.234
a way to communicate with God.

00:31.235 --> 00:33.757
Since you've found the key,
has your life gotten better

00:33.998 --> 00:34.678
or worse?

00:34.843 --> 00:36.313
People are coming for you, Joe.

00:36.314 --> 00:39.647
They won't mind killing you, or your family
to get their hands on these objects.

00:40.357 --> 00:42.112
- Anna!!
- Daddy!

00:42.113 --> 00:43.845
My daughter disappeared
inside that room.

00:43.846 --> 00:45.849
Is there an object that
can bring her back?

00:45.850 --> 00:47.407
Yes, the prime object.

00:47.408 --> 00:48.811
Give me the key, Joe.

00:48.994 --> 00:50.398
Whose side are you on?

00:51.780 --> 00:54.830
Detective Joe Miller
just shot his partner.

01:57.789 --> 01:58.325
Hello?

01:58.617 --> 02:01.605
Daddy!
Daddy, help me, please!

02:45.414 --> 02:46.080
Bingo.

02:52.949 --> 02:53.793
Glad to see me?

02:54.557 --> 02:56.408
I'm not sure I can trust you.
Sorry.

03:00.143 --> 03:00.712
Look,

03:01.540 --> 03:02.547
you called me.

03:03.668 --> 03:05.048
You need the Legion's help.

03:05.178 --> 03:06.234
I'm helping you.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.840
How do I know
you're going to help me?

03:08.848 --> 03:10.738
Well, I'm not the one
who killed my partner.

03:10.963 --> 03:11.823
I didn't kill Lou.

03:13.370 --> 03:14.068
Look at me.

03:16.244 --> 03:16.861
I didn't.

03:19.214 --> 03:20.005
Okay.

03:28.186 --> 03:31.755
Here, some fake ID's, a couple of credit
cards, this should last for a while.

03:32.932 --> 03:33.896
"Joe Doorman?"

03:34.957 --> 03:35.825
Hilarious.

03:41.072 --> 03:42.365
I have two objects here.

03:43.021 --> 03:44.496
It's your nail file
and the pen.

03:44.632 --> 03:46.474
Get rid of them.
Do whatever you guys do.

03:47.630 --> 03:49.443
Does this mean
you're gonna join us?

03:50.648 --> 03:52.906
Just tell me what you know
about the prime object.

03:53.128 --> 03:54.440
Most people think it's a myth.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.118
Those who don't?

03:56.890 --> 03:59.225
End up dead or crazy
looking for it. Why?

04:00.536 --> 04:02.012
I need it to find my daughter.

04:03.681 --> 04:05.349
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

04:06.749 --> 04:07.636
Joe!

04:15.228 --> 04:16.057
Next.

04:20.147 --> 04:21.247
And my photos.

04:27.729 --> 04:28.810
What's the last name?

04:29.195 --> 04:30.218
Stritzke.

04:30.507 --> 04:32.262
S.T.R.I.T.Z.K.E.

04:35.995 --> 04:36.729
Oh,

04:36.979 --> 04:38.311
Mr. Stritzke's here.

04:40.193 --> 04:41.621
Did you ever here of digital?

04:42.180 --> 04:43.492
12 bucks.

04:51.467 --> 04:52.046
Hey!

04:56.869 --> 04:57.911
What's going on?

05:02.579 --> 05:03.389
Next time,

05:03.524 --> 05:04.971
have a little couth, huh?

05:51.563 --> 05:52.219
Great.

06:18.059 --> 06:18.946
Damn it!

06:38.335 --> 06:41.808
- He must've ditched the key.
- We'll go back, check the alley again.

07:30.714 --> 07:31.794
Indestructible.

07:32.276 --> 07:33.357
No joke.

07:41.826 --> 07:42.425
Marty.

07:42.579 --> 07:44.450
- Detective Lee.
- Hi.

07:44.817 --> 07:47.090
Look, I'm sorry to make you
go through this again,

07:47.091 --> 07:48.631
but I'm still a little confused

07:48.632 --> 07:50.791
about the order of events
around Lou's murder.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.605
I've already spoken
to internal affairs.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.424
I know. Bear with me.

07:54.456 --> 07:56.226
I just have some
questions of my own.

07:56.365 --> 07:57.874
Who fired the first shot?

07:57.899 --> 07:59.804
You're not on this case
officially, are you?

07:59.805 --> 08:01.621
No, no, I just want
to understand.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.798
I'm sorry, Lee.
It's been a terrible week.

08:05.035 --> 08:08.053
Helen hasn't been sleeping,
and quite frankly neither have I.

08:08.539 --> 08:09.851
If you've read the report,

08:09.940 --> 08:13.673
it should all add up.
The crime scene matches my description.

08:13.850 --> 08:15.885
Forensically...yes.

08:17.988 --> 08:19.223
I'm really tired.

08:41.956 --> 08:44.278
- You have to eat, hon.
- I can't.

08:46.742 --> 08:48.079
It's this house.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.648
I can't stay in this
house anymore, Marty.

08:50.859 --> 08:52.467
Lou was murdered in the next room.

08:52.468 --> 08:54.800
- Helen, please.
- You saw joe pull the trigger.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.230
He almost killed you.

08:56.516 --> 08:58.933
Helen, you have no idea
what you're talking about!

09:04.241 --> 09:05.120
I'm sorry, hon.

09:07.318 --> 09:07.888
It's just...

09:09.126 --> 09:10.151
What?

09:14.174 --> 09:15.135
What?

09:17.268 --> 09:18.392
Don't get the phone.

09:19.287 --> 09:20.199
Don't get the phone!

09:20.606 --> 09:22.804
What do you mean I have no idea?
Martin!

09:22.967 --> 09:23.862
I have to take it.

09:28.340 --> 09:29.073
Hello.

09:29.415 --> 09:31.336
<i>Have you found us
an object, dr. Ruber?</i>

09:31.516 --> 09:33.128
Uh, I'm trying. I...

09:33.486 --> 09:36.010
<i>You had a chance to take the key.
Did you take it?</i>

09:36.759 --> 09:37.899
It got away from me.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.286
<i>Bring us an object and you'll be
welcomed into the Order with open arms.</i>

09:41.548 --> 09:42.672
<i>Do you understand?</i>

09:42.883 --> 09:43.779
Perfectly.

09:43.828 --> 09:46.042
<i>Look for Kang. K-A-N-G.</i>

09:47.382 --> 09:48.278
Kang.

09:50.916 --> 09:51.990
Martin, who was that?

09:54.205 --> 09:55.117
Martin!

10:13.890 --> 10:15.250
Detective Miller.

10:17.005 --> 10:19.112
I should thank you
for exposing my...

10:19.155 --> 10:20.976
security weaknesses.

10:21.700 --> 10:22.314
I won't.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.772
Bit of a sore loser.

10:25.496 --> 10:26.395
Come on in.

10:32.823 --> 10:34.008
Where's the key?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.092
You can't have it.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.649
But it's mine.

10:38.570 --> 10:39.601
I paid for it.

10:40.150 --> 10:42.322
I gave someone money.
It's mine.

10:43.396 --> 10:44.910
It was stolen from me.

10:45.283 --> 10:46.555
That's a crime, detective.

10:47.542 --> 10:50.394
Or are you so far gone you
no longer care about the law?

10:51.513 --> 10:54.387
I guess not.
You broke into my house. Stole my clock.

10:55.637 --> 10:56.712
You mind if I sit down?

10:57.875 --> 10:58.709
Please.

11:07.681 --> 11:09.238
My daughter went inside that room.

11:09.875 --> 11:10.796
The motel room.

11:11.893 --> 11:12.902
And she's gone.

11:14.504 --> 11:16.215
So I need the key to get her back.

11:21.788 --> 11:23.477
How on Earth would you do that?

11:25.166 --> 11:26.373
The prime object.

11:28.172 --> 11:29.751
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find it.

11:33.348 --> 11:34.204
How about I...

11:34.708 --> 11:36.485
give you some advice instead?

11:40.368 --> 11:41.333
Walk away.

11:42.737 --> 11:46.159
You have no idea what you're getting
yourself into. You certainly don't know

11:46.565 --> 11:50.339
just how deep this well goes.
And that you will never

11:50.470 --> 11:51.392
climb out.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.450
Unless you just walk away.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.378
You done?

12:03.041 --> 12:05.169
You've done me wrong, detective Miller.

12:05.871 --> 12:07.714
It's just that simple.

12:09.031 --> 12:12.278
Men and women have
died doing me wrong.

12:12.387 --> 12:13.682
You're not getting the key.

12:13.923 --> 12:15.546
You can lose all you ever wanted.

12:15.854 --> 12:17.323
I have nothing to lose.

12:23.158 --> 12:25.001
Take the coat. Let him go.

12:30.354 --> 12:32.767
We have a lot in common, detective.

12:33.447 --> 12:34.434
I could have helped you,

12:35.421 --> 12:36.868
Sorry about your daughter.

12:40.620 --> 12:41.914
I really am.

12:49.262 --> 12:49.986
Follow him?

12:50.447 --> 12:51.171
No.

12:51.829 --> 12:53.057
It's up to him now.

13:26.052 --> 13:27.039
Thanks buddy.

13:52.937 --> 13:53.881
Mr. Kreutzfeld?

13:54.451 --> 13:55.131
He's back.

14:04.521 --> 14:06.649
And bearing gifts.

14:06.956 --> 14:07.899
The clock returns.

14:11.826 --> 14:12.528
Thank you.

14:12.989 --> 14:14.678
Maybe I can trust you after all.

14:15.226 --> 14:16.257
The key stays with me

14:16.872 --> 14:17.420
for now.

14:18.605 --> 14:21.161
Why don't you tell me what
you know about the prime object?

14:21.413 --> 14:22.664
Can we start over?

14:23.585 --> 14:26.480
As long as it don't begin with
you shooting me in the back, yeah.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.236
Fair enough.

14:28.521 --> 14:31.175
- First name's Joe. Can I call you that?
- That's my name.

14:32.002 --> 14:32.967
Mine's Karl.

14:34.086 --> 14:36.740
Joe, how much do you know
about the objects, their history?

14:36.916 --> 14:37.574
Not a lot.

14:38.933 --> 14:42.728
First known date of existence
is May 4th, 1961,

14:43.211 --> 14:45.756
no one really knows how
or why they came to be.

14:45.757 --> 14:49.200
What we do know is that people
have been fighting over them ever since.

14:50.204 --> 14:53.363
In the beginning,
there was one cabal. The collectors.

14:54.569 --> 14:56.149
Started gathering objects

14:56.150 --> 14:58.781
before anyone else
knew what was going on.

14:59.636 --> 15:03.651
Within five years,
they had gathered almost all of them.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.547
Damn near 100.

15:09.355 --> 15:10.364
What happened then?

15:11.439 --> 15:14.291
Well, they annihilated themselves,
didn't they?

15:16.979 --> 15:19.546
Most of them were killed.
The rest simply went insane.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.025
But a few of the surviving

15:22.053 --> 15:24.504
disciples thought it best
to gather the most

15:24.614 --> 15:27.400
important objects and
hide them in a vault.

15:28.607 --> 15:30.954
I've spent a considerable
amount of time

15:30.955 --> 15:33.959
and a ridiculous sum of money
trying to find this vault.

15:34.749 --> 15:37.162
I have no idea where it is,
but what I do know

15:37.952 --> 15:39.729
is that in order to get to it...

15:40.255 --> 15:41.923
- You need the key.
- Yes.

15:45.455 --> 15:46.859
No offense, Karl.

15:48.438 --> 15:49.974
I just want to find my daughter.

15:51.553 --> 15:52.716
Yes, of course.

15:55.195 --> 15:56.774
The prime object is what you need.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.012
If it exists, it's inside the vault.

16:00.415 --> 16:03.377
I have my own object I need
from the vault. The glass eye.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.295
They say it can repair all flesh.

16:07.589 --> 16:08.993
And what do you want it for?

16:14.939 --> 16:18.383
This handsome young man
is my son Isaac.

16:21.016 --> 16:21.806
Hey, buddy.

16:22.069 --> 16:23.824
Fell asleep watching the movie?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.369
Yeah. Say hello to Joe.

16:26.918 --> 16:27.488
Hi, Joe.

16:28.629 --> 16:29.309
Hello, Isaac.

16:29.748 --> 16:32.687
I was telling him about
our plans to cure you.

16:32.775 --> 16:35.298
- What's the name of your disease?
- Leukemia.

16:35.875 --> 16:36.994
That's the one, huh?

16:38.683 --> 16:40.548
Go back to sleep, tough guy.

16:45.023 --> 16:47.238
Perhaps now you see why I'm so...

16:47.874 --> 16:48.752
desperate

16:49.300 --> 16:50.310
and willing

16:51.056 --> 16:52.635
to do whatever it takes.

16:53.754 --> 16:56.211
I too just want to save my child.

16:59.897 --> 17:01.454
Maybe we can help each other.

17:05.731 --> 17:08.473
The last possible surviving
member of the collectors

17:08.474 --> 17:10.205
is a woman named
Barbara Stritzke.

17:10.776 --> 17:13.540
She's nearly impossible
to find or to kill

17:14.022 --> 17:16.742
because she has an
almost unbeatable object,

17:17.226 --> 17:17.884
the comb.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.026
Oh, no! Oh, shoot!

17:27.613 --> 17:29.950
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Did I scratch it?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.260
Oh, who can tell?

17:32.304 --> 17:36.121
I might have scratched it. Let me see if I
can give you something for the scratch.

18:04.573 --> 18:07.337
<i>Need your help.
Where are you?</i>

18:22.254 --> 18:23.658
I'll be back.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.707
Jennifer Bloom.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.054
What do you want, Joe?

18:38.643 --> 18:41.396
Well, I'm looking for somebody,
and I thought you could help me.

18:41.934 --> 18:43.864
But... am I interrupting something?

18:43.865 --> 18:45.927
No, forget it.
What are you looking for?

18:47.533 --> 18:49.683
I'm trying to find a woman
named Barbara Stritzke.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.816
So now you need my help?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.432
You and Kreutzfeld.
What a pair.

19:00.828 --> 19:02.254
He's all right for a rich guy.

19:02.255 --> 19:04.636
Under different circumstances,
we could be friends.

19:05.543 --> 19:07.430
Kreutzfeld used to be on our side.

19:07.737 --> 19:08.812
He was Legion.

19:09.668 --> 19:12.981
Quit a few years ago.
Started buying up objects like crazy.

19:14.034 --> 19:16.162
He paid my partner 2 million dollars

19:16.163 --> 19:18.488
to betray the Legion
and steal the key.

19:19.693 --> 19:21.668
You really think you can
trust a man like that?

19:21.669 --> 19:22.940
His kid is dying.

19:23.774 --> 19:26.822
My daughter vanished inside that room.
I'm hoping we can help each other.

19:26.823 --> 19:28.578
Oh, don't be a sucker, Joe.

19:28.819 --> 19:32.987
Hey, I will try every means necessary
to get my daughter back, every means.

19:36.837 --> 19:37.561
All right.

19:39.447 --> 19:41.312
I will help you find Barbara Stritzke.

19:43.002 --> 19:44.099
But afterwards,

19:45.064 --> 19:46.468
the Legion gets the comb.

19:47.740 --> 19:49.364
All right, deal.

19:51.185 --> 19:52.173
What does the comb do?

19:52.567 --> 19:53.598
It stops time.

19:54.827 --> 19:55.661
Wait here.

20:08.779 --> 20:11.499
- Arjun Mehta. How may I help you?
- Look out your window.

20:13.627 --> 20:15.754
<i>I've got Joe Miller in the car
and he has the key.</i>

20:15.755 --> 20:16.874
You brought him here?

20:17.312 --> 20:18.431
<i>He doesn't know.</i>

20:18.892 --> 20:20.252
<i>I can take the key now</i>

20:20.456 --> 20:21.663
<i>with your say so.</i>

20:25.765 --> 20:27.937
He's more valuable if
we recruit him to our side.

20:28.090 --> 20:29.714
He won't join.

20:30.097 --> 20:32.807
<i>He thinks he can bring back
his daughter with the right objects.</i>

20:32.808 --> 20:35.111
We all think we can undo
things in the beginning.

20:35.396 --> 20:36.208
Remember?

20:38.543 --> 20:39.881
<i>Well, if we don't act now,</i>

20:40.627 --> 20:42.536
it could fall into Kreutzfeld's hands.

20:42.537 --> 20:45.124
Stay close to him.
Earn his trust.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.162
Show him we're trying to help.
And, Jennifer...

20:51.605 --> 20:53.953
Give him the Stritzke info.
But stay with him.

21:05.692 --> 21:07.436
Well, I've got good news and bad news.

21:08.204 --> 21:10.617
The good news is
I have a lead on Barbara Stritzke.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.955
She's in Michigan.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.443
And what's the bad news?

21:15.444 --> 21:16.649
It's Order territory.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.382
Badly cabal to mess with...

21:26.324 --> 21:30.778
<i>Suzie Kang. Cash only. Paid upfront</i>

21:35.055 --> 21:37.732
<i>30124 Eastwick.</i>

21:56.489 --> 21:58.332
I'm sorry, hon.

22:07.151 --> 22:08.270
Excuse me.

22:09.126 --> 22:11.144
Excuse me. Are you Suzie Kang?

22:18.143 --> 22:19.832
- Do I know you?
- No.

22:20.644 --> 22:21.873
My name's Martin Ruber.

22:22.289 --> 22:23.452
I'm looking for an object.

22:23.716 --> 22:24.571
Get lost.

22:26.589 --> 22:27.994
I have cash.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.099
What are you looking for?

22:30.517 --> 22:32.470
Something... easy.

22:32.777 --> 22:34.071
You know, something close.

22:34.751 --> 22:35.804
5000.

22:38.353 --> 22:40.195
5000 dollars.

23:03.186 --> 23:04.327
Your lucky day.

23:04.502 --> 23:06.191
Guy in Bloomfield's a mechanic.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.759
So he posts a query on
some motorhead board

23:08.760 --> 23:11.627
asking if anyone knows
why a pair of glasses

23:11.628 --> 23:13.536
would prevent a car from starting.

23:13.711 --> 23:16.892
- I don't get it.
- The glasses inhibit combustion.

23:29.594 --> 23:30.757
Do you have an object?

23:31.196 --> 23:31.722
No,

23:32.024 --> 23:32.770
I just track 'em.

23:33.164 --> 23:34.042
Never touch 'em.

23:34.766 --> 23:35.972
Those things'll kill you.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.066
Thanks.

23:42.370 --> 23:43.774
Newbies. You gotta love 'em.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.790
Barbara always leaves a key

23:46.791 --> 23:48.000
up there in the frog.

23:48.132 --> 23:50.128
- When will she be back?
- From the dead?

23:50.129 --> 23:53.090
- Well, how about never?
- Here. I'll make it...

23:53.091 --> 23:55.654
Barbara's nephew Harold
is living here now.

23:55.749 --> 23:58.425
He's let this place go
to hell in a hand basket.

23:58.426 --> 24:00.882
- I hardly ever see him.
- Well, we'll be just a minute.

24:01.453 --> 24:04.085
Okay. Well, I'll be right
here when you come out.

24:04.086 --> 24:04.700
Okay!

24:23.347 --> 24:24.816
Guess Barbara was a good shot.

24:26.441 --> 24:28.503
No wonder the Order
never messed with her.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.927
And it looks like nephew
Harold's a Peeping Tom.

24:38.879 --> 24:40.612
Oh, my God.

24:59.237 --> 25:01.145
I'm gonna go check the
women's locker room.

25:18.433 --> 25:19.223
Harold!

25:19.530 --> 25:20.715
Harold Stritzke!

25:27.833 --> 25:30.795
<i>Oh my God! Come on!
What are you doing?</i>

25:52.864 --> 25:53.479
Harold,

25:53.873 --> 25:56.484
I need your help.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

25:57.471 --> 25:58.436
Go away!

27:14.098 --> 27:14.800
Damn it!

27:25.647 --> 27:27.260
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

27:27.863 --> 27:29.354
<i>You can't have it!</i>

28:23.822 --> 28:26.301
<i>- Hey you two, take it outside
- Pick up, pick up.</i>

28:47.482 --> 28:49.138
You're a tough man to catch, Harold.

28:54.536 --> 28:55.787
Holy crap!

28:56.511 --> 28:58.002
This is the room, ain't it?

28:59.143 --> 29:00.811
What are you gonna do to me?

29:00.812 --> 29:02.346
Nothing. Just calm down.

29:03.838 --> 29:07.129
- What happens if I open this door?
- Without the key, you'll die instantly.

29:10.683 --> 29:11.517
Really?

29:11.846 --> 29:12.592
Yeah.

29:22.803 --> 29:23.878
You with the Order?

29:25.875 --> 29:28.090
No, don't get
paranoid on me, Harold.

29:30.043 --> 29:31.645
Paranoid. Ha!

29:31.886 --> 29:34.255
Like nobody's trying
to get my comb, right?

29:34.286 --> 29:36.985
And nobody's trying
to shoot me in the back.

29:37.116 --> 29:40.692
Paranoid! I'd have been shot times
by now if I didn't have the comb.

29:41.745 --> 29:44.476
If you didn't have the comb,
nobody would shoot at you.

29:47.984 --> 29:49.859
Yeah, well, that's just
your opinion, buddy.

29:49.892 --> 29:52.323
You've got an object.
I don't see you giving it up.

29:55.406 --> 29:57.175
My daughter disappeared
inside this room,

29:57.176 --> 29:59.430
so I'm keeping the key
until I can get her back.

30:02.161 --> 30:03.186
She disappeared?

30:04.098 --> 30:04.491
Yeah.

30:05.179 --> 30:06.022
No fooling.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.005
Yeah, no fooling.
So once I get her back,

30:08.033 --> 30:10.728
they can shoot the objects
to the moon for all I care.

30:13.032 --> 30:14.831
What do you know
about the prime object?

30:15.489 --> 30:15.971
The what?

30:15.972 --> 30:18.276
The prime object, the one
that controls all the others.

30:18.277 --> 30:21.095
Your aunt barbara was a collector.
She must've known about it.

30:21.281 --> 30:23.124
Well, I don't know.
She never said.

30:25.844 --> 30:28.016
You know, don't bother.
Objects don't work in here.

30:29.486 --> 30:31.043
Yeah, right.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.983
All right,
make sure you try all of them.

30:34.619 --> 30:35.913
Did you get that one there?

30:43.438 --> 30:45.632
It's gonna be ok.
I'm just gonna reset the room.

30:51.621 --> 30:53.770
No! Where'd it go?!

30:53.771 --> 30:55.229
Where did it go?!

30:55.230 --> 30:56.810
Where's the comb?!

30:57.105 --> 30:58.334
Harold, Harold, Harold.

30:58.839 --> 30:59.848
Calm.

31:07.219 --> 31:08.470
Oh, my God!

31:09.348 --> 31:11.871
Harold, I need you to
teach me how to use that comb.

31:17.530 --> 31:18.758
How do I know when it works?

31:19.547 --> 31:21.061
Well, it'll be pretty ob...

31:36.408 --> 31:37.373
... obvious.

31:38.228 --> 31:39.567
Oh, look, you did it!

31:41.124 --> 31:41.848
You okay?

31:42.943 --> 31:43.907
I'm a little dizzy.

31:43.908 --> 31:45.882
Yeah, it takes some
getting used to, huh?

31:45.937 --> 31:49.469
You try doing that three, four times in
a row, you're gonna puke your guts out.

31:49.798 --> 31:51.377
You mean you always feels like this?

31:51.575 --> 31:52.759
Wait, you do that every time?

31:52.869 --> 31:55.736
Oh, non, you gotta stop just before you
snap back into it, okay?

31:55.905 --> 31:57.155
- You stop, okay?
- Yeah.

31:57.216 --> 32:00.200
And then also, these little buddies.
Motion sickness pills.

32:00.287 --> 32:01.801
Can't go anywhere without those.

32:02.447 --> 32:03.894
Take one. Take two.

32:04.026 --> 32:04.509
I'm good.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.110
So it just lasts for a few seconds?

32:06.341 --> 32:07.811
Yeah, ten seconds tops.

32:07.812 --> 32:09.182
Yeah, you gotta use it carefully.

32:09.183 --> 32:11.946
Hiding spots are a plus,
to let you catch your breath, you know?

32:12.111 --> 32:14.930
Hey, you want to see something?
You want to try again? Watch this.

32:14.986 --> 32:18.287
Try to take that. I bet you can't do it.
You can't do it. Go on. Go on, try.

32:18.430 --> 32:20.163
You can't do it. Come on.

32:34.574 --> 32:36.505
Butterfingers! You see?

32:36.614 --> 32:39.159
Everything's frozen.
It's like you can't open doors even.

32:39.510 --> 32:41.002
You just gotta move and hide.

32:41.122 --> 32:42.329
Move and hide, that's it.

32:42.702 --> 32:44.281
That's about all you can do, really.

32:46.804 --> 32:48.120
Hey, here. Thanks.

32:48.362 --> 32:49.810
You're giving it back to me?

32:50.095 --> 32:51.038
You gonna run away?

32:52.289 --> 32:52.969
No.

32:53.540 --> 32:54.264
All right then.

32:54.944 --> 32:57.664
Trust me, Harold. I don't want the comb.
I just want your help.

32:59.662 --> 33:00.693
You promise

33:01.000 --> 33:02.338
you won't take my comb?

33:03.282 --> 33:04.642
It's all I got.

33:07.209 --> 33:08.415
I promise.

33:10.175 --> 33:11.228
Thanks, buddy.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.118
- Just a phone.
- Okay, yeah.

33:17.282 --> 33:18.401
<i>Just a phone.</i>

33:19.871 --> 33:20.595
Oh, great.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.096
Forget something?

33:23.272 --> 33:25.839
Yeah, listen, I'm sorry about that.
But I'm with our guy.

33:26.238 --> 33:27.181
You're kidding me.

33:27.598 --> 33:28.388
With the comb?

33:28.761 --> 33:29.463
Where are you?

33:29.814 --> 33:30.582
Kansas.

33:31.481 --> 33:32.863
Well, bring him back.

33:33.346 --> 33:35.254
I can't do that.
I need some more time.

33:35.824 --> 33:37.119
We had a deal, Joe.

33:37.272 --> 33:40.508
Listen, I said you could keep it.
I didn't say i'd steal it for you.

33:42.230 --> 33:44.840
Jennifer, I can't do it.
The comb is all he's got.

33:45.454 --> 33:46.902
You messed up, Joe.

34:09.793 --> 34:12.339
- She's in Michigan. We got her.
- Stay on her.

34:13.523 --> 34:14.706
Who's that, your girlfriend?

34:14.839 --> 34:17.208
More like the ex-girlfriend I never had.

34:18.898 --> 34:20.587
I got some of those.

34:21.552 --> 34:24.842
Harold, you gotta think. Is there anything
that your aunt may have left behind?

34:24.844 --> 34:26.773
A notebook, a map, anything.

34:28.813 --> 34:29.559
No.

34:31.818 --> 34:33.529
Oh. Wait!
She did leave something.

34:34.911 --> 34:35.943
In the woods.

35:12.381 --> 35:13.281
283,

35:13.785 --> 35:14.728
Gotcha.

35:39.759 --> 35:40.768
Who the hell are you?

35:41.646 --> 35:43.905
I understand that
you found my glasses.

35:45.039 --> 35:46.026
Your glasses?

35:46.355 --> 35:47.079
Yes.

35:47.518 --> 35:50.611
Every time I wear them,
my car won't start.

35:52.558 --> 35:55.212
That's just too bad, cause...
I decided not to sell them.

35:55.432 --> 35:57.999
Whatever you heard was a mistake.
You understand me...

35:58.876 --> 35:59.820
dork?

36:38.320 --> 36:39.724
<i>Oh! Oh, God!</i>

36:41.326 --> 36:42.445
<i>Help me!</i>

36:43.842 --> 36:45.289
<i>Somebody help me!</i>

37:32.112 --> 37:33.472
Where's she gone?

37:34.503 --> 37:36.170
It's been a while. Sorry.

37:36.763 --> 37:38.342
I know it's out here somewhere.

37:38.934 --> 37:40.295
Overgrown.

37:41.787 --> 37:42.620
Oh, there she is.

37:43.125 --> 37:43.805
Deer hut.

37:44.858 --> 37:46.591
My aunt used to take
me hunting out here.

37:46.592 --> 37:48.895
Sounds like your aunt
was a sweet lady, Harold.

37:49.001 --> 37:50.295
Yeah, she sure was.

37:52.248 --> 37:53.301
Oh, God.

37:53.433 --> 37:54.749
Sorry about the smell.

37:54.969 --> 37:56.395
It's been a while.

38:01.923 --> 38:02.933
Damn.

38:06.684 --> 38:08.110
Ah, still here.

38:09.843 --> 38:11.839
She asked me to hide it until...

38:12.234 --> 38:13.682
until it was time.

38:14.318 --> 38:16.150
- Time for what?
- I don't know.

38:16.479 --> 38:18.344
Maybe until you came looking for them.

38:18.761 --> 38:20.494
- Can I took a look at them?
- Sure.

38:39.689 --> 38:40.588
"Gallup."

38:41.334 --> 38:42.453
Like a horse.

38:43.572 --> 38:45.195
No, like New Mexico.

38:46.270 --> 38:48.321
Harold, do you have
a lighter or some matches?

38:48.595 --> 38:49.736
Yeah, I think so.

38:51.085 --> 38:51.875
<i>Let's see.</i>

38:55.495 --> 38:56.197
Yeah.

38:59.610 --> 39:00.422
Thank you.

39:03.207 --> 39:04.195
What are you doing?

39:10.095 --> 39:11.280
It's an object.

39:11.817 --> 39:12.541
No.

39:12.990 --> 39:15.382
Is that the prime object? The thing...

39:15.601 --> 39:19.089
I don't know, Harold, but thank you.
Can I keep these polaroids?

39:19.550 --> 39:20.295
Sure.

39:21.436 --> 39:23.345
You gonna keep the comb too?

39:23.498 --> 39:24.705
Tell him, Joe.

39:26.679 --> 39:28.237
He promised the comb to the Legion.

39:28.544 --> 39:29.202
No!

39:29.619 --> 39:31.067
- No... no.
- Joe.

39:31.400 --> 39:32.716
I'm not gonna take the comb.

39:33.199 --> 39:35.217
- He's using you, Harold.
- Wait a minute.

39:38.782 --> 39:40.822
Harold, easy, easy! Look at me!

39:40.954 --> 39:41.941
Give me the comb.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.718
Who's shooting? How many?

39:44.903 --> 39:47.162
There's four of them.
We're being flanked.

39:47.163 --> 39:49.333
- It's the Order!
- Stay down!

39:49.443 --> 39:51.483
I will bring it back.
Take this.

39:53.179 --> 39:54.796
Oh, God!

40:23.452 --> 40:25.098
Watch out! He's got the comb!

40:26.809 --> 40:29.025
- There he is!
- You go straight. I'll go around.

41:21.479 --> 41:22.641
Don't shoot!

41:38.941 --> 41:40.059
Here. You want that?

41:42.824 --> 41:44.053
You gonna be all right?

41:45.084 --> 41:46.356
I guess so.

41:46.751 --> 41:49.713
I'm gonna get a doctor to take
a look at it though, just in case.

41:56.106 --> 41:56.742
No.

41:57.324 --> 41:58.816
You keep it.

41:58.991 --> 42:00.637
I don't want it anymore.

42:00.638 --> 42:01.383
You sure?

42:01.624 --> 42:03.840
I'm sick of people taking pot shots.

42:05.068 --> 42:06.231
Keep it.

42:07.700 --> 42:08.951
Good luck!

42:24.263 --> 42:25.141
You okay?

42:26.984 --> 42:27.630
No.

42:31.328 --> 42:33.061
I never killed anyone before.

42:57.914 --> 42:59.713
I've brought you an object.

43:17.700 --> 43:18.534
All right.

43:19.916 --> 43:20.727
You're in.

43:26.300 --> 43:28.647
Welcome to the Order, Martin Ruber.

43:35.953 --> 43:37.883
It's all right.
You're not in hell anymore.

43:39.244 --> 43:41.064
- Wally. Come here.
- What? What I do?

43:45.166 --> 43:47.952
You know, it's really no fun for me
if you keep bringing them back.

43:47.953 --> 43:48.304
Yeah.

43:48.831 --> 43:49.511
Listen...

43:50.344 --> 43:51.397
You recognize these?

43:52.885 --> 43:54.003
This is an object.

43:55.429 --> 43:56.812
What is this? What's in Gallup?

43:58.172 --> 43:59.466
I give up. What?

44:00.168 --> 44:00.914
Don't lie to me.

44:01.361 --> 44:03.686
This says Gallup.
Your bus ticket takes you to Gallup.

44:03.687 --> 44:07.131
It's not really Gallup technically.
It's just outside Gallup.

44:07.132 --> 44:08.403
Yeah, I know. I was just there.

44:08.404 --> 44:11.012
- I want to understand this.
- You don't want to know, Joe.

44:11.013 --> 44:13.184
If I show you what's there,
there's no going back.

44:13.185 --> 44:14.940
It won't bring your daughter home.

44:15.938 --> 44:17.737
It will make you crazy.

44:20.317 --> 44:21.679
I don't have a choice, Wally.

44:23.056 --> 44:24.349
I have to go. Now show me.

44:25.472 --> 44:26.386
Come on!

44:27.735 --> 44:28.971
Remember, you asked for this.

44:48.964 --> 44:50.444
All right. So why here?

44:51.202 --> 44:52.343
Why the middle of nowhere?

44:52.737 --> 44:54.054
It's not the middle of nowhere.

44:54.624 --> 44:55.918
It's the middle of everywhere.

44:56.050 --> 44:56.796
Everything.

44:57.242 --> 44:58.119
Come on.

45:45.309 --> 45:46.362
You feel that, Joe?

45:47.459 --> 45:48.051
Feel what?

45:48.468 --> 45:49.214
That.

45:50.004 --> 45:53.075
Like when the objects start
to get close together. That...

45:53.711 --> 45:55.356
sick feeling. Like a...

45:55.729 --> 45:57.375
vibration almost in here.

45:57.740 --> 46:00.613
I've been feeling that for a while now.
I thought it was just nerves.

46:00.614 --> 46:04.006
It's the motel. All the objects.
The key, the room, everything,

46:04.071 --> 46:06.309
they all came from this place.

46:06.967 --> 46:08.591
You knew this was here the whole time?

46:08.592 --> 46:10.192
It's a bad place.

46:12.276 --> 46:13.636
What else don't I know?

46:19.361 --> 46:20.502
The event

46:21.291 --> 46:24.275
happened on may 4th, 1961.

46:26.294 --> 46:27.808
1:20 pm.

46:28.597 --> 46:29.124
The event?

46:29.125 --> 46:31.581
Whatever created these objects.

46:32.037 --> 46:32.717
See,

46:33.221 --> 46:35.832
the objects want
to be put back together.

46:35.942 --> 46:38.059
You think it was an accident, us meeting?

46:38.060 --> 46:40.406
You think finding
the polaroid was an accident?

46:40.407 --> 46:45.265
I may have shown you the way,
but the objects brought you here.

46:58.738 --> 47:00.691
- Where's room 10?
- There is no room.

47:01.414 --> 47:02.884
Never existed.

47:04.112 --> 47:08.061
At least not after may 4th, 1961.

47:45.005 --> 47:46.036
You know what that is?

47:46.935 --> 47:49.129
Object chart. I've seen one before.

48:07.414 --> 48:10.244
Are... you... him?

48:40.684 --> 48:41.694
Martin Ruber...

48:41.847 --> 48:42.396
Yes.

48:43.076 --> 48:45.642
Do you believe in
the reunification of God?

48:46.519 --> 48:48.296
Do you believe in the truth,

48:48.801 --> 48:49.919
the Order,

48:50.358 --> 48:51.521
the new religion?

48:52.311 --> 48:53.166
Yes.

48:55.337 --> 48:57.400
Do you reject your former life?

48:58.474 --> 49:00.142
Do you give yourself

49:00.405 --> 49:01.326
to the Order?

49:03.146 --> 49:04.100
Yes.

49:26.558 --> 49:27.698
Then pray.

49:50.712 --> 49:52.818
Pray to this object.

49:54.244 --> 49:55.231
What is it?

49:57.083 --> 49:58.640
It's a piece of God.

50:00.286 --> 50:02.128
Like every other object.

50:03.774 --> 50:05.551
And I want you to pray to it.

50:17.267 --> 50:19.197
If we can reunite all the objects,

50:20.887 --> 50:23.102
we can restore the mind of God.

50:24.353 --> 50:25.779
We can communicate

50:26.152 --> 50:27.073
with God

50:27.707 --> 50:29.682
for the first time in human history.

50:32.556 --> 50:35.276
- Do you believe that, Martin?
- Yes. Yes, I believe.

50:39.422 --> 50:40.936
Then open your eyes

50:41.375 --> 50:43.350
and embrace the Order.

50:53.003 --> 50:54.210
Stupid.

50:55.066 --> 50:56.053
Arrogant.

50:58.072 --> 51:00.595
You live only because
I was once like you.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.058
But you will learn,

51:06.760 --> 51:07.308
Martin.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.889
Thank me for this mercy.

51:20.119 --> 51:21.194
Thank you.

52:17.574 --> 52:19.329
The motel room key

52:20.283 --> 52:23.717
is the most important object
to the Order right now.

52:26.086 --> 52:28.785
Margaret, I want your group
to find Joe Miller

52:29.136 --> 52:30.276
and take the key.

52:30.672 --> 52:33.041
We can't have another
screw up like Michigan.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.806
Ray Korey's group in New York

52:36.179 --> 52:37.890
and Parchman's group in Cleveland

52:38.592 --> 52:40.457
will act as support if necessary.

52:41.443 --> 52:44.405
I understand Dr. Ruber
knows Joe Miller personally,

52:45.085 --> 52:46.621
which is why the job is yours.

52:47.608 --> 52:50.285
I don't think Dr. Ruber's in
any kind of shape to help us,

52:50.286 --> 52:51.952
considering his falling out with Miller.

52:52.150 --> 52:54.278
That's exactly why
Miller will talk to me.

52:56.295 --> 52:58.072
He'd like to kill me.

53:01.693 --> 53:03.360
There's no such thing as ghosts.

53:04.172 --> 53:06.716
Fine. I'm just asking you.
You swear you didn't see her?

53:06.936 --> 53:07.923
Didn't see her.

53:09.524 --> 53:12.375
- I don't believe in ghosts, all right?
- Yeah, me neither, I mean,

53:12.376 --> 53:13.385
magic bus tickets, sure,

53:13.386 --> 53:15.300
- but ghosts, no.
- I've seen the bus ticket, all right?

53:15.301 --> 53:17.494
- With my eyes seen it.
- Well, I saw her.

53:17.495 --> 53:19.118
And whatever she is, she was there.

53:20.112 --> 53:20.639
Here.

53:22.372 --> 53:23.228
Tape that down.

53:24.961 --> 53:25.626
Are you ready?

53:25.627 --> 53:26.635
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

54:07.702 --> 54:10.466
- I feel stupid. Do you?
- Just give it a sec.

54:41.946 --> 54:42.363
Great.

54:42.582 --> 54:43.767
The camera's broken.

54:44.545 --> 54:46.683
You know, I might be able
to dig it out and fix it.

54:46.684 --> 54:47.342
The key's okay.

54:53.277 --> 54:54.045
Yeah, Miller.

54:54.703 --> 54:56.063
Joe, it's Ruber.

54:56.414 --> 54:58.564
We need to talk... about your daughter.

55:15.325 --> 55:16.663
What do you want, Ruber?

55:16.751 --> 55:18.528
I want to help you get
your daughter back.

55:19.098 --> 55:19.909
Yeah?

55:20.886 --> 55:22.696
Any thoughts about getting Lou back?

55:23.507 --> 55:25.350
I've joined a group, Joe.

55:25.591 --> 55:26.885
A cabal.

55:27.421 --> 55:29.791
They're called the
Order of the Reunification.

55:29.831 --> 55:31.433
They believe in the objects.

55:31.762 --> 55:33.188
They want to use them.

55:33.363 --> 55:34.811
Do you have any idea

55:34.965 --> 55:37.465
how powerful the objects really are?

55:37.992 --> 55:40.844
The Order thinks if they can
get all the objects back together...

55:42.160 --> 55:44.617
- they can talk to God.
- That's insane.

55:45.670 --> 55:47.315
Come with me to the Order.

55:48.610 --> 55:49.531
Give us the key.

55:50.189 --> 55:52.383
If anybody can bring Anna back, we can...

55:52.971 --> 55:53.936
together.

55:54.243 --> 55:55.450
Someday, Ruber...

55:56.382 --> 55:58.137
you're gonna get
what's coming to you.

56:00.013 --> 56:01.856
Someday you're gonna need me, Joe.

56:13.034 --> 56:14.503
I've almost got this thing working.

56:16.258 --> 56:18.079
<i>Can you make animal pancakes?</i>

56:18.517 --> 56:20.272
What kind of animal pancakes you want?

56:20.448 --> 56:21.040
Elephant.

56:21.522 --> 56:24.461
All right, I don't know how to make
an elephant, but how about a mouse?

56:24.462 --> 56:25.439
Elephant.

56:28.883 --> 56:30.924
Okay, okay, okay. I got it, I got it.

56:43.980 --> 56:45.779
All right, wait. Go back, go back.

56:48.103 --> 56:49.113
Slow it down.

56:53.260 --> 56:54.861
She's disintegrating.

56:54.862 --> 56:56.990
You see, somehow
the key brings her back

56:57.231 --> 56:58.701
just for a few seconds into our...

56:59.688 --> 57:00.653
time and space.

57:01.157 --> 57:03.483
What's it like for her
the rest of the time when she's

57:03.593 --> 57:05.062
not in our space?

57:05.764 --> 57:06.510
I don't know.

57:07.764 --> 57:09.892
But Anna may be
trapped in the same place.

57:10.111 --> 57:11.713
I need to find out who she is.

57:13.533 --> 57:15.134
You sure you know where you're going?

57:15.420 --> 57:16.298
Yes.

57:16.868 --> 57:17.745
How much further?

57:18.019 --> 57:19.994
I don't know. Not much.

57:20.454 --> 57:23.723
- Doesn't seem like much of a shortcut.
- Please don't complain to me now.

57:25.205 --> 57:26.602
Hey, what's the name of this town?

57:26.603 --> 57:28.620
I don't remember.
Nobody goes there anymore.

57:28.725 --> 57:29.602
Why not?

57:29.756 --> 57:32.652
You know, the questions get
really boring after a while.

57:32.958 --> 57:34.801
I don't know the name
of the town, okay?

57:34.802 --> 57:37.543
Doesn't matter.
What it was a long time ago I don't know..

57:41.904 --> 57:43.264
You're trespassing.

57:43.461 --> 57:44.185
Sorry.

57:44.580 --> 57:47.673
We didn't know anybody lived here.
We're just heading into the town.

57:49.582 --> 57:51.381
There ain't a town anymore.

58:00.101 --> 58:00.716
Friendly.

58:00.913 --> 58:02.547
That's why I don't like coming here.

58:05.608 --> 58:06.025
Come on.

58:06.288 --> 58:06.661
Come on.

58:06.946 --> 58:08.153
Just relax.

58:12.518 --> 58:14.427
- Where is everybody?
- Exactly.

58:16.336 --> 58:17.916
Make an offer. What do you think?

58:33.250 --> 58:34.347
Proud of yourself?

58:41.103 --> 58:42.002
What's the problem?

58:42.200 --> 58:43.735
I've been here a couple times.

58:43.987 --> 58:45.479
I... I don't like it in there.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.498
Just stick with me a
little longer, all right?

58:48.424 --> 58:49.587
I'll buy you lunch.

59:02.553 --> 59:03.935
Bus station's that way.

59:04.352 --> 59:05.646
Not looking for the bus station.

59:07.775 --> 59:09.113
I'm hungry. I'd like to eat.

59:17.120 --> 59:17.932
Tell you what.

59:18.063 --> 59:19.423
I'll just have the special.

59:19.665 --> 59:21.179
Turkey, mashed potatoes.

59:21.180 --> 59:23.319
Sounds good.
Some apple pie, coffee, please.

59:23.320 --> 59:25.841
- I'll have two of the same.
- Two?

59:25.842 --> 59:26.851
Yeah, two.

59:30.262 --> 59:32.894
- See why I don't like this place?
- Relax, okay?

59:36.558 --> 59:37.457
Anything else?

59:38.028 --> 59:38.752
Yeah.

59:38.753 --> 59:40.437
I'd like to know about that motel.

59:52.832 --> 59:54.993
What's the matter?
I can't ask a simple question?

59:56.013 --> 59:58.799
- What happened at that motel?
- Motel's haunted.

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:02.847
What do you mean "haunted"?

01:00:02.979 --> 01:00:06.127
There's these people out of nowhere
coming down over the hill thinking

01:00:06.128 --> 01:00:07.114
they're in Hell.

01:00:07.893 --> 01:00:09.319
Used to hardly happen at all.

01:00:09.603 --> 01:00:11.753
Now it happens all the time.

01:00:12.016 --> 01:00:14.155
All right, what about the
woman at the motel?

01:00:17.808 --> 01:00:19.146
The woman?

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:21.187
The ghost?

01:00:22.504 --> 01:00:23.447
Who's seen her?

01:00:24.303 --> 01:00:25.356
Nobody, huh?

01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.897
We'll take the rest at the booth.

01:00:37.564 --> 01:00:40.076
I know I'm not hallucinating,
but I feel like I'm losing it.

01:00:40.077 --> 01:00:40.800
You're losing it?

01:00:40.954 --> 01:00:41.919
You see these people?

01:00:42.402 --> 01:00:44.639
They're living a mile
and a half from that motel.

01:00:44.734 --> 01:00:47.338
It's making them half-crazy,
and they don't even know why.

01:00:47.586 --> 01:00:49.473
Most people left a while ago, but...

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:51.864
they...

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:54.079
a lot of them never
figured out... what?

01:00:56.869 --> 01:00:58.062
There's our ghost.

01:01:09.786 --> 01:01:10.523
Hi.

01:01:12.822 --> 01:01:13.682
You want to come in?

01:01:15.999 --> 01:01:17.245
I don't think so.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:24.915
Better?

01:01:25.231 --> 01:01:26.003
Much.

01:01:27.354 --> 01:01:28.811
I want to ask you a question.

01:01:29.826 --> 01:01:31.186
Do you recognize her?

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:34.015
No.

01:01:35.397 --> 01:01:36.341
Who is she?

01:01:37.043 --> 01:01:39.280
She's a woman I saw at the motel.

01:01:41.429 --> 01:01:43.667
The actual motel, room number 9.

01:01:46.058 --> 01:01:46.936
What's wrong?

01:01:47.945 --> 01:01:49.546
Joe, don't go back there.

01:01:53.429 --> 01:01:56.083
- You knew about it?
- You wouldn't understand.

01:01:56.566 --> 01:01:58.387
What wouldn't I understand, Jennifer?

01:02:03.367 --> 01:02:05.583
That's the guy from
the hospice, isn't it?

01:02:07.316 --> 01:02:08.435
He's my brother.

01:02:09.554 --> 01:02:10.344
Drew.

01:02:11.397 --> 01:02:14.600
We all have a reason to get rid
of the objects. Drew is my reason.

01:02:15.258 --> 01:02:18.198
He became obsessed with room 9.

01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:21.269
And whatever happened to him in there...

01:02:21.532 --> 01:02:22.629
destroyed him.

01:02:23.814 --> 01:02:26.469
So, Joe, you promise me
you won't go back there.

01:02:37.724 --> 01:02:39.589
I am sorry about your brother.

01:02:40.247 --> 01:02:41.498
I really am.

01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:43.942
But I have to go back,
because whatever's happening

01:02:43.943 --> 01:02:46.290
to that woman could be
happening to Anna right now.

01:02:47.091 --> 01:02:49.943
So I'm gonna find out the names
of everyone in this picture,

01:02:49.944 --> 01:02:53.254
and hopefully I can talk to one of them.
Because if I can bring that woman back,

01:02:53.255 --> 01:02:54.330
I can bring Anna back.

01:02:55.295 --> 01:02:56.195
I know it.

01:03:19.427 --> 01:03:21.357
My brother's research on room 9.

01:04:11.749 --> 01:04:12.473
Yeah.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.338
Home sweet home.

01:04:33.711 --> 01:04:35.335
Jennifer, I...

01:05:02.452 --> 01:05:03.351
You all right?

01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:07.190
Yeah.

01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:15.505
Just don't break my heart.

01:05:21.231 --> 01:05:22.174
Don't break mine.

01:06:05.722 --> 01:06:07.411
Jennifer, get dressed.
We have to go.

01:06:07.609 --> 01:06:08.772
What's going on?

01:06:08.954 --> 01:06:10.007
Get everything.

01:06:35.455 --> 01:06:36.683
Still here.

01:06:37.078 --> 01:06:39.250
Whoever made that print
was here in 1961.

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:42.584
I think my brother identified
the people in this photo.

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:44.734
They are the collectors.

01:06:46.598 --> 01:06:49.670
The woman you saw was
the motel manager in 1966.

01:06:49.671 --> 01:06:50.767
Arlene Conroy.

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:53.824
Arlene Conroy.

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.588
The woman in the picture, right?

01:06:56.983 --> 01:06:57.685
Yeah.

01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:01.750
What happened to the rest of them?

01:07:04.405 --> 01:07:05.940
Everyone else is dead.

01:07:16.865 --> 01:07:18.817
We need to find out
who this belongs to.

01:07:32.922 --> 01:07:33.866
Somebody in there?

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:35.357
Yeah, just working late.

01:07:36.608 --> 01:07:38.407
Who's in there? Pendergast?

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:39.686
<i>Yeah, buddy.</i>

01:07:43.897 --> 01:07:44.994
I've seen this guy.

01:07:45.894 --> 01:07:46.991
I'll be damned.

01:07:46.992 --> 01:07:48.131
<i>Who the hell's in there?!</i>

01:07:54.986 --> 01:07:56.895
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:08:16.642 --> 01:08:18.529
Who are hell are you?
Get out of my house!

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:20.657
Gus Jacobs,
I want to know about Arlene Conroy.

01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:23.971
I've seen her.

01:08:25.332 --> 01:08:26.648
At the motel.

01:08:33.295 --> 01:08:34.688
Please, tell me what happened.

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:36.542
I don't know.

01:08:38.911 --> 01:08:39.832
I don't know.

01:08:40.841 --> 01:08:42.837
I wish to God I could help her.

01:08:44.528 --> 01:08:45.910
She's my wife.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:05.017
My daughter disappeared inside
that motel room, same as your wife.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.550
She's only 8 years old.

01:09:09.866 --> 01:09:10.853
Oh, God.

01:09:13.223 --> 01:09:15.285
- I'm sorry.
- Please help me.

01:09:17.018 --> 01:09:18.542
Tell me what happened in room 9.

01:09:22.975 --> 01:09:27.187
Do you know how the objects were created?
Were you and Arlene involved somehow?

01:09:27.318 --> 01:09:28.053
No.

01:09:28.808 --> 01:09:29.466
God, no.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:30.694
How could we?

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:32.933
We just...

01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:35.301
we just ran the motel. That's all.

01:09:36.113 --> 01:09:38.242
Arlene managed it.
I was a janitor.

01:09:38.593 --> 01:09:40.412
It was just a regular place.

01:09:41.883 --> 01:09:43.725
It's not like something happened.

01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:45.173
It's like,

01:09:45.371 --> 01:09:47.740
afterward we figured
something must've happened.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.613
The motel only has 9 rooms, right?

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:52.149
Except,

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:54.737
one day Arlene finds
the key to room 10.

01:09:55.768 --> 01:09:57.107
We tried the key and...

01:09:58.006 --> 01:09:58.818
well...

01:09:59.717 --> 01:10:01.713
I suppose you know what we saw.

01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:04.587
There was still a few objects inside.

01:10:05.113 --> 01:10:06.386
I didn't want any of it.

01:10:07.571 --> 01:10:09.787
But Arlene got this look in her eye.

01:10:10.116 --> 01:10:12.288
She wanted to get all the objects back.

01:10:13.056 --> 01:10:15.162
She got some of our friends involved.

01:10:15.929 --> 01:10:18.957
- Pretty soon we were this group.
- The collectors.

01:10:23.562 --> 01:10:25.295
By '66, we had...

01:10:25.296 --> 01:10:27.358
found almost all the objects.

01:10:27.928 --> 01:10:31.548
And since there wasn't a room 10,
Arlene started experimenting in room 9.

01:10:32.564 --> 01:10:34.956
And finally she found the watch box.

01:10:37.786 --> 01:10:39.541
And that's when everything went wrong.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:41.844
What do you mean "went wrong"?

01:10:45.558 --> 01:10:46.984
It's easier if I show you.

01:10:49.573 --> 01:10:52.513
This is a copy. The original was stolen...

01:10:52.711 --> 01:10:53.742
years ago.

01:11:13.444 --> 01:11:16.230
She looks the same.
God, she looks exactly the same.

01:11:18.205 --> 01:11:21.061
Arlene had been looking for
the five objects for years.

01:11:21.851 --> 01:11:25.317
She said with the right combination
she could open the door,

01:11:25.789 --> 01:11:26.765
the right way.

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:30.165
I think she was insane by then.

01:11:32.571 --> 01:11:34.326
Then I gave her the watch box.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:36.871
And everything went bad.

01:11:40.052 --> 01:11:41.895
She opened the door, and it was like...

01:11:42.926 --> 01:11:45.098
like she opened a tear in reality.

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:53.435
What the hell is happening?

01:11:53.436 --> 01:11:55.432
Gus, was this film spliced together?

01:11:55.981 --> 01:11:56.529
No.

01:11:57.034 --> 01:11:58.723
It's one continuous piece of film.

01:12:03.484 --> 01:12:05.809
Arlene sacrificed herself to end it.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.623
I saw Arlene a few months later

01:12:23.624 --> 01:12:24.698
at the motel.

01:12:25.071 --> 01:12:26.737
Just for a few seconds.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:28.317
She begged me to help her.

01:12:29.063 --> 01:12:30.028
I couldn't.

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:31.608
I didn't know how.

01:12:32.025 --> 01:12:33.670
I got rid of the key and...

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:35.491
I never went back.

01:12:36.675 --> 01:12:37.926
I changed names.

01:12:38.364 --> 01:12:39.659
Traveled all over.

01:12:41.348 --> 01:12:43.191
Eventually I came back. I...

01:12:44.441 --> 01:12:46.569
I guess I just want to be near her.

01:12:49.421 --> 01:12:50.913
Gus, what does the box do?

01:12:55.892 --> 01:12:57.296
May I take this film?

01:12:58.108 --> 01:12:58.920
Take it.

01:13:00.214 --> 01:13:01.684
I never want to watch it again.

01:13:04.645 --> 01:13:06.554
And if you do find my wife,

01:13:08.177 --> 01:13:10.041
please put her out of her misery.

01:13:19.364 --> 01:13:22.457
You're not gonna believe this, Detective.
We had a break-in last night.

01:13:22.896 --> 01:13:23.554
Shut up.

01:13:23.758 --> 01:13:26.610
Someone came in just to
use the fingerprint database.

01:13:27.268 --> 01:13:29.001
They logged in under Joe Miller.

01:13:29.527 --> 01:13:31.128
Why does Joe still have a login?

01:13:31.435 --> 01:13:33.783
Well, we've got a lot on
our plate, Detective. It's...

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:35.546
What was he looking for?

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:39.790
Okay.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:41.952
Looks like Joe Miller's
headed to New Mexico. 

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:47.856
I think this must be the box.

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:50.730
Well, if the key brings conroy
back part way, maybe with the box

01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:52.143
she'll come back all the way.

01:13:52.603 --> 01:13:54.117
I don't know. Something's missing.

01:13:55.012 --> 01:13:56.197
How do I get the box?

01:13:57.447 --> 01:13:58.391
If you do this,

01:13:58.392 --> 01:13:59.690
I'm going in with you.

01:14:01.928 --> 01:14:02.783
There's a woman.

01:14:02.784 --> 01:14:04.253
She's an object tracker.

01:14:04.734 --> 01:14:07.257
She won't deal with the Legion,
but she might deal with you.

01:14:07.806 --> 01:14:09.078
Her name's Suzie Kang.

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:12.719
Who was it referred you again?

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:14.628
I just heard your name
around, that's all.

01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:16.251
- You work for the Legion?
- No.

01:14:17.238 --> 01:14:17.721
Good.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:19.477
Bunch a scumbags.

01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:21.835
Always trying to hide
the objects from everybody.

01:14:21.845 --> 01:14:22.898
It's bad for business.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.457
But they'll get theirs.

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:25.547
I'm on my own.

01:14:26.469 --> 01:14:27.478
And I have the key.

01:14:28.355 --> 01:14:29.430
You're the new motel man.

01:14:29.716 --> 01:14:30.374
Joe Miller.

01:14:30.461 --> 01:14:32.238
Yeah, whatever.
Can I see the key?

01:14:32.447 --> 01:14:33.500
Can I point my gun at you?

01:14:33.653 --> 01:14:34.992
I just want to see the key.

01:14:39.518 --> 01:14:40.330
Damn.

01:14:42.501 --> 01:14:43.554
All right, Mr. Guy.

01:14:43.862 --> 01:14:45.068
What are you looking for?

01:14:45.946 --> 01:14:46.758
The box.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:50.114
- Well, that is totally ungettable.
- Where is it?

01:14:50.443 --> 01:14:52.615
You know, I feel bad for you
because you're stupid.

01:14:52.966 --> 01:14:54.129
1000 bucks.

01:15:22.536 --> 01:15:23.589
The watch box.

01:15:23.809 --> 01:15:26.244
Dampens entropy for a limited radius.

01:15:26.407 --> 01:15:27.811
I must've been absent that day.

01:15:28.689 --> 01:15:30.948
It prevents things from decaying.

01:15:31.453 --> 01:15:32.177
Who has it?

01:15:33.581 --> 01:15:34.875
They call themselves the Order.

01:15:34.929 --> 01:15:36.706
Very, very nasty cabal.

01:15:36.947 --> 01:15:38.658
Box was their first object.

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:40.457
They based the whole religion around it.

01:15:40.468 --> 01:15:41.060
Thank you.

01:15:55.703 --> 01:15:58.127
- I guess if you were gonna shoot...
- Shut up and listen.

01:15:58.128 --> 01:16:00.671
The Order has an object that I need.
The watch box.

01:16:00.672 --> 01:16:02.735
- Where do they keep it?
- I don't know.

01:16:03.601 --> 01:16:04.785
Don't lie to me, Ruber.

01:16:04.898 --> 01:16:06.562
You'll never get near it, Joe.

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:08.307
Then close your eyes.

01:16:08.308 --> 01:16:09.667
Listen to me, Joe.

01:16:09.668 --> 01:16:12.357
You can't get the box, but I can.

01:16:14.730 --> 01:16:16.858
- I'll get the box for you.
- Sit down.

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:20.806
Joe...

01:16:21.794 --> 01:16:23.900
I want to see the motel room again.

01:16:24.338 --> 01:16:25.852
I want to go inside.

01:16:26.334 --> 01:16:27.124
Why?

01:16:28.133 --> 01:16:29.910
Because when I saw that room...

01:16:30.525 --> 01:16:32.170
I knew that there was something

01:16:32.389 --> 01:16:34.802
in that room that I was meant to see.

01:16:35.285 --> 01:16:37.226
I don't know why, Joe,
but I need to see it.

01:16:37.786 --> 01:16:40.023
I need to get inside that room.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:49.117
The only reason that you're alive
is because I need that box.

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:53.329
You get the box,
you get inside the room.

01:16:58.112 --> 01:17:00.262
If I make it out of there in one piece,

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:04.013
I promise I will find
a way to wake you up.

01:17:13.885 --> 01:17:15.289
Oh, my god, Drew.

01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:17.241
The comb.

01:17:34.637 --> 01:17:37.851
I wanted to let you know I think
I found a way to bring your wife back.

01:17:39.837 --> 01:17:41.833
All you'll bring her is pain.

01:17:42.732 --> 01:17:44.356
Just let it go, son.

01:17:48.787 --> 01:17:50.367
I'm sorry. I have to give it a try.

01:17:53.789 --> 01:17:55.390
Excuse me.

01:17:58.242 --> 01:17:59.328
- Miller. 
<i>- Joe, listen.</i>

01:17:59.394 --> 01:18:01.741
<i>The last object my brother
was missing was the comb.</i>

01:18:01.895 --> 01:18:03.540
<i>I got it back from the Legion.</i>

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.285
I'll be right there.

01:18:06.821 --> 01:18:07.589
I have to go.

01:18:11.823 --> 01:18:12.547
Joe...

01:18:13.995 --> 01:18:17.241
Arlene didn't disappear
the same way your daughter did.

01:18:18.272 --> 01:18:19.742
Arlene had the key.

01:18:21.453 --> 01:18:23.187
It was the objects that ate her.

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:31.149
It was the objects.

01:18:38.235 --> 01:18:41.482
Joe Miller, you're under arrest for
the murder of detective Lou Destefano

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:43.128
and the kidnapping of Anna Miller. 

01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.693
Want to make a statement?

01:18:55.319 --> 01:18:57.535
Do you want to make a statement?

01:19:07.627 --> 01:19:08.790
Ex-wife,

01:19:09.558 --> 01:19:12.300
custody battle. They're gonna put
you away and run you up.

01:19:13.264 --> 01:19:14.954
Tell me what happened.

01:19:16.994 --> 01:19:18.113
I can't do that.

01:19:19.472 --> 01:19:20.789
You know me.

01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:24.013
You've been to my house.
Our kids play together.

01:19:24.014 --> 01:19:26.273
I've seen you with Anna.
You're a good dad.

01:19:27.281 --> 01:19:27.896
Okay?

01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:29.519
This isn't you.

01:19:30.924 --> 01:19:33.095
Now, let me help you
get whoever did this.

01:19:33.096 --> 01:19:35.070
Lee, I'm telling you for your girls...

01:19:37.527 --> 01:19:38.799
Drop this case.

01:19:40.884 --> 01:19:42.946
What the hell did you
get yourself into?

01:19:48.714 --> 01:19:51.128
You know, Lou asked me
the same thing, and now he's dead.

01:19:55.076 --> 01:19:55.998
And Anna?

01:19:58.498 --> 01:19:59.464
She's alive.

01:20:01.241 --> 01:20:04.180
And if I have to rip the world
in half to get her back, I will.

01:20:20.437 --> 01:20:21.490
Last chance.

01:20:28.586 --> 01:20:29.266
Lee!

01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:33.654
Are you alright?

01:20:34.072 --> 01:20:34.620
Lee!

01:20:35.366 --> 01:20:36.572
Damn! Sorry.

01:20:42.408 --> 01:20:44.229
Get down! Do it now! Do it now!

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:45.501
Comply, comply!

01:20:51.319 --> 01:20:52.745
You got the key, Joe?

01:20:53.228 --> 01:20:55.070
Yeah, I got the key, Ruber,
and I'm armed.

01:21:11.767 --> 01:21:12.359
Stop!

01:21:13.390 --> 01:21:16.023
Put it in park. Now take the
keys out of the ignition. Now!

01:21:18.589 --> 01:21:20.739
Jennifer, look away!
He's got the deck of cards.

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.724
Put 'em on the dashboard, Ruber, now!

01:21:24.493 --> 01:21:25.393
Get out!

01:21:25.788 --> 01:21:26.468
Get out!

01:21:27.696 --> 01:21:29.013
Up against the van!

01:21:31.623 --> 01:21:34.167
- No, no, Joe!
- Give me the watch box!

01:21:34.705 --> 01:21:36.504
- Give me the box!
- There it is!

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:38.303
Joe?

01:21:39.502 --> 01:21:41.082
- Joe, take the comb!
- Joe!

01:21:41.652 --> 01:21:42.881
What are you doing?!

01:21:43.056 --> 01:21:43.671
Joe!

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:44.680
Joe!

01:21:45.140 --> 01:21:46.106
Joe!

01:21:46.841 --> 01:21:47.740
<i>Let me in!</i>

01:21:48.749 --> 01:21:49.758
Arlene!

01:21:58.031 --> 01:21:59.588
Open the box!

01:22:06.345 --> 01:22:07.881
Have you seen a little girl?

01:22:09.834 --> 01:22:13.482
I have lost my daughter. She is
trapped in the room. Please help me.

01:22:13.931 --> 01:22:15.204
<i>Are you him?</i>

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.387
Am I who?

01:22:17.486 --> 01:22:19.855
<i>The man. The man in the picture!</i>

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.422
Picture? What picture?

01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:24.230
Please! Make it stop!

01:22:24.796 --> 01:22:26.862
- What picture?
- Joe!

01:22:27.310 --> 01:22:28.648
Don't close it!

01:22:30.886 --> 01:22:33.211
Joe, the comb! The comb!

01:22:39.716 --> 01:22:42.151
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:46.824
I'm not the man in the picture. I'm sorry.

01:22:47.745 --> 01:22:49.084
<i>I know.</i>

01:22:51.606 --> 01:22:53.559
<i>I saw your daughter.</i>

01:22:57.924 --> 01:22:59.921
<i>She's waiting for you, Joe.</i>

01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:22.428
She said she saw Anna.

01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:36.600
I don't understand.

01:23:37.083 --> 01:23:38.136
What happened?

01:23:38.465 --> 01:23:39.254
I don't know.

01:23:39.583 --> 01:23:41.952
But I think I know
what picture she was talking about.

01:23:42.259 --> 01:23:43.159
It's this one.

01:23:43.949 --> 01:23:44.739
What is that?

01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:47.334
It's the room.

01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:54.398
Oh, my God.

01:24:06.222 --> 01:24:07.867
Would you move, Ruber?

01:24:12.956 --> 01:24:15.633
This must be exactly
how the room was in 1961.

01:24:16.511 --> 01:24:18.485
Just before the objects changed.

01:24:38.252 --> 01:24:39.831
- What was that?
- What?

01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:41.483
What the hell is that?

01:24:45.069 --> 01:24:45.947
It's a man.

01:24:46.890 --> 01:24:48.733
There was an occupant in room 10.

01:24:51.014 --> 01:24:52.243
Incredible.

01:25:00.184 --> 01:25:01.150
Let's go.

01:25:07.774 --> 01:25:09.858
You can't leave me here, Joe.
I gave you the box.

01:25:10.099 --> 01:25:11.240
We had a deal.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.464
Come on, Ruber.

01:25:18.304 --> 01:25:19.510
Oh my God!

01:25:20.761 --> 01:25:22.911
I'm actually in... the room.

01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.020
He was right here.

01:25:47.833 --> 01:25:49.105
Feel enlightened, Ruber?

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:50.992
Yes.

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.327
Yes, I am.

01:26:00.316 --> 01:26:03.080
Objects don't work in the room, Ruber.

01:26:20.961 --> 01:26:22.146
He stole it!

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:23.813
Doesn't matter.

01:26:25.173 --> 01:26:26.007
Why?

01:26:28.025 --> 01:26:29.166
The man in the room.

01:26:29.891 --> 01:26:30.680
Yeah?

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:33.905
If I'm right, he's the prime object.

01:26:37.986 --> 01:26:39.105
And we're gonna find him.
