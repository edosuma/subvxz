THAT'S NOT THE WAY

10:50.358 --> 10:52.193
I HEARD IT.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.193
YOU HEARD IT WRONG.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.322
HOW MUCH YOU WANNA BET?

10:52.235 --> 10:55.322
THE MONEY IN MY PURSE,

10:52.235 --> 10:55.322
PLUS $1 MILLION.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.740
WELL, MY SPELLING STINKS.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.740
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.496
YOU'LL CALL ME FROM THE CABIN?

10:59.993 --> 11:02.496
ABSOLUTELY.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.872
THANKS FOR THE COFFEE.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.872
ANY TIME.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.375
BETTER HAVE THAT MILLION READY,

11:04.914 --> 11:07.375
AND I DON'T ACCEPT COINS.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.835

11:10.795 --> 11:11.754
Rory: HELLO.

11:11.796 --> 11:12.839

11:12.880 --> 11:14.673
OW!

11:12.880 --> 11:14.673
RAT BASTARD!

11:14.715 --> 11:15.716
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.511
GIVE ME A HAND!

11:17.552 --> 11:20.472
OKAY, BOB HOPE'S LAUGHING

11:17.552 --> 11:20.472
IN HEAVEN, BUT I'M NOT.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.515
BOB HOPE GOT INTO HEAVEN?

11:21.556 --> 11:22.557
PLEASE GRAB A BAG.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.100
THIS CANNOT ALL BE LAUNDRY.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.893
IT'S ALL LAUNDRY.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.893
THE MACHINE'S FIXED, RIGHT?

11:25.935 --> 11:28.062
YES, AND HUMMING LIKE NEW.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.062
WHICH ONE'S THE RAT BASTARD?

11:28.104 --> 11:29.356
THAT ONE.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.356
TAKE THAT! AND THAT!

11:29.397 --> 11:31.065
OKAY, HE'S HAD ENOUGH.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.442
I WANNA GET A LOAD GOING

11:31.107 --> 11:32.442
BEFORE I GO TO GRANDMA'S.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.527
GOOD IDEA.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.821
HEY, YOU'RE USING IT.

11:36.863 --> 11:37.989
YES, I KNOW.

11:38.031 --> 11:38.990
WELL, I GOT DIBS.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.699
YOU DIDN'T CALL DIBS.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.827
I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT

11:40.741 --> 11:42.827
COMING HOME ON SPRING BREAK.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.829
THAT IMPLIES DIBS

11:42.869 --> 11:44.829
ON THE WASHER AND DRYER.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.498
THERE'S NO IMPLIED DIBS

11:44.871 --> 11:46.498
IN DIBS.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.500
IF YOU DON'T CALL IT,

11:46.540 --> 11:48.500
YOU DON'T GET IT.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.835
WELL, THIS IS JUST WRONG.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.462
WHAT?

11:52.504 --> 11:54.005
YOU'RE WASHING TWO SOCKS.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.507
THEY WERE DIRTY.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.507
THAT'S WASTEFUL.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.342
I REALLY WANTED

11:55.549 --> 11:57.342
TO WEAR THEM TONIGHT.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.302
THEY ARE YOUR DANCING

11:57.384 --> 11:59.302
SANTA CLAUS SOCKS.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.304
YOU'RE NOT GONNA

11:59.344 --> 12:01.304
WEAR THOSE FOR 10 MONTHS.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.057
I CAN WEAR THEM ECCENTRICALLY

12:01.346 --> 12:04.057
ANY TIME I WANT.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.476
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

12:04.098 --> 12:06.476
TO PUT ONE OF MY LOADS

12:04.098 --> 12:06.476
IN WHILE I'M GONE.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.726
AND RISK A HERNIA?

12:07.768 --> 12:09.396
I'LL NEVER FINISH OTHERWISE.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.855
I'LL DO TWO LOADS.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.855
HOW'S THAT?

12:10.897 --> 12:13.107
THANK YOU.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.107
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA TAKE OFF.

12:13.149 --> 12:15.734
DRIVE SAFE, AND

12:13.149 --> 12:15.734
YOU'VE GOT GAS, RIGHT?

12:15.776 --> 12:17.028
YEAH, I GOT GAS.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.279
ENOUGH GAS TO GET

12:17.070 --> 12:18.279
TO HARTFORD?

12:18.321 --> 12:20.073
I THINK SO.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.073
WHY?

12:20.114 --> 12:23.410
BECAUSE I'VE GOT A $20 --

12:20.114 --> 12:23.410
AH, $20 ON THE FRIDGE HERE.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.495
LOOK.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.495
HO-HO, HERE IT IS!

12:25.537 --> 12:27.372
I'M NOT GONNA USE IT.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.372
YOU SHOULD USE IT FOR GAS.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.873
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS I'M BROKE?

12:28.915 --> 12:30.417
YOU MENTIONED THE MINUTES

12:28.915 --> 12:30.417
ON YOUR CELLPHONE,

12:30.458 --> 12:31.792
A HINT OF PANIC

12:30.458 --> 12:31.792
IN YOUR VOICE,

12:31.834 --> 12:33.961
AND NOW THE MONTHS

12:31.834 --> 12:33.961
OF SAVED-UP LAUNDRY.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.923
THERE ARE NO GOOD JOBS AT

12:34.003 --> 12:36.923
YALE, AND I'D TAKE ANYTHING.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.259
I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF ASKING

12:36.964 --> 12:39.259
AROUND TOWN FOR YOU.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.052
MADE YOU SOUND

12:39.300 --> 12:41.052
ALL PATHETIC AND RAGGED.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.388
AND THERE ARE A FEW TEMPORARY

12:41.094 --> 12:43.388
THINGS YOU COULD TAKE.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.140
YOU ARE VERY IN DEMAND

12:43.430 --> 12:46.140
IN STARS HOLLOW.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.140
LIKE WHAT?

12:46.182 --> 12:48.393
THE RADIO STATION NEEDS

12:46.182 --> 12:48.393
SOMEONE TO DRIVE UP THE HILL

12:48.435 --> 12:49.894
A COUPLE TIMES A DAY

12:49.936 --> 12:51.563
AND SHOO THE COWS AWAY

12:49.936 --> 12:51.563
FROM THE TRANSMITTER.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.440
I'M NOT GOOD WITH LIVESTOCK.

12:53.481 --> 12:57.193
THE ROAD CREW NEEDS A PART-TIME

12:53.481 --> 12:57.193
"SLOW DOWN" SIGN-HOLDER-UPPER.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.236
YOU'D GET TO WEAR A HELMET.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.320
I DON'T THINK SO.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.905
I SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.117
ANDREW NEEDS HELP DOING

13:00.947 --> 13:04.117

13:04.158 --> 13:06.119
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY

13:04.158 --> 13:06.119

15:12.453 --> 15:14.080
THEY LIKE TO THINK SO,

15:14.121 --> 15:16.875
BUT WE FOUND THIS CHARMING

15:14.121 --> 15:16.875
LITTLE TAVERNA -- "DIONYSUS."

15:16.916 --> 15:18.376

15:50.991 --> 15:52.368
NOW, I CAN'T REALLY DANCE

BECAUSE MY ANKLES ARE

15:52.410 --> 15:54.328
COMPLETELY SWOLLEN

15:54.370 --> 15:56.414
AND MY STOMACH IS A BIT OF A

HINDRANCE ON THE DANCE FLOOR,

15:56.456 --> 15:58.374
BUT I CAN WATCH YOU DANCE.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.876

15:58.416 --> 15:59.876
LET'S DO SOMETHING ELSE.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.210
BUT YOU WANT TO GO DANCING.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.587

WE CAN GO TO A BAR.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.589

16:05.882 --> 16:07.592
A DEPRESSED

16:07.634 --> 16:09.343
WHEN I'M IN A ROOM FULL

16:07.634 --> 16:09.343
OF PEOPLE DRINKING

16:09.385 --> 16:11.095
AND I CAN'T HAVE A COCKTAIL.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.306
DID I TELL YOU I'M

16:11.137 --> 16:13.306
HAVING A RECURRING DREAM

16:13.347 --> 16:15.892
ABOUT A MAGIC PIñA COLADA

16:13.347 --> 16:15.892
WITH WHIPPED CREAM

16:15.934 --> 16:19.437
AND A TON OF RUM AND A TALKING

16:15.934 --> 16:19.437
LITTLE PAPER UMBRELLA?

16:19.479 --> 16:21.397
IF YOU'RE HAVING DREAMS LIKE

16:19.479 --> 16:21.397
THAT, YOU DON'T NEED A COCKTAIL.

16:21.439 --> 16:22.816
HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

16:22.857 --> 16:24.400
I HAVE TO GET UP TO PEE

16:22.857 --> 16:24.400
EVERY FIVE MINUTES,

16:24.442 --> 16:25.902
BUT WE CAN SIT ON AN AISLE

16:24.442 --> 16:25.902
NEAR THE BACK,

16:25.944 --> 16:27.320
AND YOU CAN FILL ME IN

16:25.944 --> 16:27.320
ON WHAT I MISS.

16:27.361 --> 16:31.324
SOOKIE, WHY DON'T

16:27.361 --> 16:31.324
WE JUST STAY HOME?

16:31.365 --> 16:33.075
NO!

16:31.365 --> 16:33.075
WE'RE HITTING THE TOWN!

16:33.117 --> 16:34.744
NOT TONIGHT.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.371
I CAN'T LET YOU BECOME

16:34.786 --> 16:37.371
THE SPINSTER ON THE COUCH.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.457
WE CAN GO INSIDE

16:37.413 --> 16:39.457
AND ORDER IN PIZZA.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.585
YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND SEE

16:39.499 --> 16:42.585
THINGS AND DO THINGS.

16:42.627 --> 16:45.087
I HAVE "A STAR IS BORN,"

16:42.627 --> 16:45.087
ALL THREE VERSIONS.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.841
WE CAN COMPARE AND CONTRAST

16:45.129 --> 16:47.841
PERFORMANCES AND DOSAGES.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.592
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY

16:47.882 --> 16:49.592
AS YOUR BEST FRIEND

16:49.634 --> 16:51.636
TO MAKE SURE YOU GO

16:49.634 --> 16:51.636
DO EXCITING THINGS

16:51.678 --> 16:53.012
EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.472
HANGING OUT WITH YOU

16:53.053 --> 16:54.472
IS EXCITING.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.849
IT IS?

16:55.890 --> 16:57.809
AND WITH PEPPERONI AND

16:55.890 --> 16:57.809
EXTRA CHEESE, LOOK OUT.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.352
I AM GETTING KIND OF HUNGRY.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.312
SURE, ALL THIS PARTYING

16:59.393 --> 17:01.312
WILL DO THAT TO YOU.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.272
CAN WE WATCH THE STREISAND

17:01.354 --> 17:03.272
"STAR IS BORN" FIRST?

17:03.314 --> 17:04.899
I REALLY LOVE THAT SCENE

17:04.941 --> 17:06.734
WHERE SHE CHEWS ON

17:04.941 --> 17:06.734
KRIS KRISTOFFERSON'S LIPS.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.120
SO, WHERE ARE ALL YOUR YALE

17:15.034 --> 17:18.120
FRIENDS FOR SPRING BREAK?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.664
UH, HERE AND THERE.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.499
DID YOUR FRIEND PARIS

17:19.706 --> 17:21.499
MAKE INTERESTING PLANS?

17:21.541 --> 17:22.667
NOT REALLY.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.460
AND HOW'S THE SHORTCAKE?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.004
IT'S FINE, THANKS.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.755
I KNOW THIS SEEMS

17:26.045 --> 17:27.755
A BIT BASIC,

17:27.797 --> 17:30.049
BUT ELIZA FOUND THE FIRST DECENT

17:27.797 --> 17:30.049
STRAWBERRIES OF THE YEAR.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.551
I'M SO MAD AT CALIFORNIA.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.594
YOU'D THINK THAT RAIN

17:31.592 --> 17:33.594
WOULD BE GOOD FOR CROPS.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.013
IT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.139
ANYWAY, THESE STRAWBERRIES

17:35.054 --> 17:37.139
ARE WONDERFUL.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.850
COULD YOU PASS THEM

17:37.181 --> 17:38.850
TO ME, RORY?

17:42.228 --> 17:47.107
[ NO AUDIO ]

17:47.149 --> 17:50.737
SO, RORY, IS EVERYTHING ALL

17:47.149 --> 17:50.737
RIGHT WITH YOU THIS EVENING?

17:50.778 --> 17:51.696
I'M FINE, GRANDPA.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.952
YOU'D TELL US IF ANYTHING

17:55.282 --> 17:57.952
WAS BOTHERING YOU?

17:57.994 --> 17:59.495
REALLY, IT'S NOTHING.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.415
SEEMS AS THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE

17:59.537 --> 18:02.415
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.000
NOT REALLY.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.793
ALL RIGHT.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.963
SO, GRANDPA, YOU HARDLY TOLD ME

18:05.835 --> 18:08.963
ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR TRIP.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.798
HOW WAS

18:09.005 --> 18:10.798
THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM?

18:10.840 --> 18:12.383
OH, NOW, THAT'S IT.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.383
EMILY.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.551
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

18:13.593 --> 18:14.928
NOTHING.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.637
I ASKED YOU ABOUT

18:14.969 --> 18:16.637
THAT MUSEUM EARLIER

18:16.679 --> 18:18.639
AND ALL YOU DID WAS MUMBLE

18:16.679 --> 18:18.639
SOMETHING ABOUT HITTING IT.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.474
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN

18:18.681 --> 18:20.474
MORE EXPANSIVE. I'M SORRY.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.226
YOU'VE BEEN PUSHING ME AWAY

18:20.516 --> 18:22.226
ALL EVENING.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.644
EMILY, PLEASE.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.438
YOU ASK YOUR GRANDFATHER

18:23.686 --> 18:25.438
QUESTION AFTER QUESTION,

18:25.479 --> 18:27.941
MAKE POLITE CHITCHAT ABOUT THE

18:25.479 --> 18:27.941
ROAST DUCK WITH THE MAID --

18:27.982 --> 18:29.776
WHAT'S HER NAME --

18:27.982 --> 18:29.776
TELL HER IT'S WONDERFUL.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.903
BECAUSE SHE MADE IT,

18:29.817 --> 18:31.903
AND HER NAME IS ELIZA.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.529
I TOLD HER TO MAKE THE DUCK.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.448
YOU'RE ENJOYING DUCK

18:33.571 --> 18:35.448
BECAUSE I REQUESTED DUCK.

18:35.489 --> 18:36.824
WELL, IT WAS A GREAT DUCK,

18:35.489 --> 18:36.824
GRANDMA.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.576
KUDOS ON THE DUCK.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.870
THIS ISN'T YOU, THIS ATTITUDE.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.870
THIS IS YOUR MOTHER.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.246
DON'T BRING UP MOM.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.831
LOOK, BOTH OF YOU,

18:42.288 --> 18:43.831
LET'S TRY TO CALM DOWN.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.750
WHY ARE YOU ACTING THIS WAY?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.543
YOUR MEMORY CAN'T BE

18:45.792 --> 18:47.543
THAT SHORT.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.543
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

18:47.585 --> 18:49.629
DO WE HAVE

18:47.585 --> 18:49.629
TO GET INTO THIS?

18:49.670 --> 18:51.672
YOU SHOULD WALK OUT

18:49.670 --> 18:51.672
THAT DOOR AND COME IN

18:49.670 --> 18:51.672
AGAIN, START ALL OVER.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.173
SHE DOESN'T NEED

18:51.714 --> 18:53.173
TO DO THAT, EMILY.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.175
WE HAVE A CONTRACT.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.845
WE PAY FOR YALE, YOU COME

18:55.217 --> 18:57.845
TO DINNER EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT,

18:57.887 --> 18:59.680
AND YOU ACT PLEASANTLY

18:57.887 --> 18:59.680
AND DECENTLY.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.223
YOU'RE RIGHT, GRANDMA.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.643
WE DO HAVE A CONTRACT,

19:01.265 --> 19:03.643
BUT IT'S TO COME TO DINNER.

19:03.684 --> 19:06.186
THERE'S NO AGREEMENT

19:03.684 --> 19:06.186
ON HOW VIVACIOUS OR BUBBLY

19:06.228 --> 19:07.354
I HAVE TO BE.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.940
YOU NEED TO ACT LIKE YOU.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.940
I AM!

19:08.982 --> 19:10.274
THIS ISN'T YOU.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.985
LOOK, GRANDMA,

19:10.316 --> 19:11.985
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.402
RORY, PLEASE SIT DOWN.

19:13.444 --> 19:14.528
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.072
10 ACROPOLIS POSTCARDS,

19:16.114 --> 19:18.407
AND I WOULD FORGET THAT

19:16.114 --> 19:18.407
YOU BROKE UP MOM AND LUKE?

19:18.449 --> 19:20.118
NOW, I RESPECT OUR CONTRACT,

19:20.159 --> 19:22.036
AND I WILL CONTINUE

19:20.159 --> 19:22.036
TO COME EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT

19:22.078 --> 19:23.663
AND EAT DINNER WITH YOU,

19:23.704 --> 19:25.539
BUT I WON'T GUARANTEE AN

19:23.704 --> 19:25.539
ATTITUDE THAT WILL PLEASE YOU.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.749
EXCUSE ME.

19:25.581 --> 19:26.749
YOU ARE CERTAINLY

19:25.581 --> 19:26.749
NOT EXCUSED.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.417
WE'RE NOT THROUGH.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.628
WE HAVE HAD DESSERT, I'LL

19:28.459 --> 19:30.628
SKIP THE PORT. GOOD NIGHT.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.255
RORY.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.255
GOOD NIGHT, GRANDPA.

19:30.670 --> 19:33.255
I'LL SEE YOU IN A WEEK.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.142
SEE, NOW, THIS IS PERFECT.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.310
IT'S NOT A NIGHTCLUB, BUT

19:44.183 --> 19:46.310
IT'S A PLACE YOU NEVER GO,

19:46.352 --> 19:47.436
SO IT'S DIFFERENT

19:46.352 --> 19:47.436
AND EXCITING.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.479
AND CHOCOLATY.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.730
ARE YOU HAVING FUN?

19:49.772 --> 19:51.482
OH, NOT MISSING

19:49.772 --> 19:51.482
THE COUCH A BIT.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.734
HEY, LORELAI.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.734
WOW, TWICE IN ONE DAY, HUH?

19:53.776 --> 19:55.111
HI, FRANKIE.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.113
YEAH, WELL, JUST GOTTA

19:55.153 --> 19:57.113
HAVE SOME PIE, YOU KNOW?

19:57.155 --> 19:59.365
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

19:59.406 --> 20:01.575
WELL, I HAVEN'T

19:59.406 --> 20:01.575
MEMORIZED THE MENU YET.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.827
YOU COME HERE?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.162
YOU KNOW, JUST ONCE A DAY.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.454
UNBELIEVABLE.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.081
I HAVE TO GO

20:05.496 --> 20:07.081
SOMEWHERE IN THE MORNING.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.833
I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE YOU

20:07.123 --> 20:08.833
SOMEWHERE YOU ALWAYS GO.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.252
I HAD A GREAT TIME TONIGHT,

20:08.875 --> 20:12.252
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN,

20:12.294 --> 20:13.838
AND I PROMISE I AM NOT GOING

20:13.880 --> 20:15.715
TO BECOME A COUCH-POTATO

20:13.880 --> 20:15.715
SPINSTER WOMAN.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.550
OKAY, THE MINUTE

20:15.756 --> 20:17.550
THIS COMES OUT,

20:17.591 --> 20:19.177
YOU AND I ARE GOING AWAY

20:17.591 --> 20:19.177
FOR A WEEKEND,

20:19.218 --> 20:20.427
JUST THE TWO OF US.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.888
ABSOLUTELY,

20:20.469 --> 20:21.888
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT

20:21.929 --> 20:23.222
THAT YOU'LL HAVE

20:21.929 --> 20:23.222
A NEWBORN BABY AT HOME,

20:23.263 --> 20:24.306
THAT'S A PERFECT PLAN.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.808
HELLO, LADIES.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.518
HI, KID.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.518
HOW'D YOU KNOW WE'D BE HERE?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.645
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU'RE

20:27.560 --> 20:29.645
ALWAYS HERE. HEY, SOOKIE.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.438
HEY, EGGHEAD.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.438
DO YOU WANT SOME PIE?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.066
I NEVER SAY "NO" TO PIE.

20:33.107 --> 20:34.608
SO, HOW WAS DINNER?

20:34.650 --> 20:35.609
LOUD.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.861
MEANING?

20:36.903 --> 20:38.029
THERE WAS YELLING.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.029
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.405
I JUST GOT SO MAD.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.032
SHE WAS ACTING LIKE

20:39.446 --> 20:41.032
NOTHING WAS WRONG.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.616
LIKE IT WAS TOTALLY NORMAL

20:41.074 --> 20:42.616
THAT YOU WEREN'T THERE,

20:42.658 --> 20:43.868
AND I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.703
I UNDERSTAND.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.703
I UNDERSTAND, TOO.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.996
YOU GETTING SLEEPY, SOOKIE?

20:47.038 --> 20:48.539
NO, I'M FINE.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.374
JUST A LITTLE

20:48.581 --> 20:50.374
PAST MY BEDTIME IS ALL.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.375
KEEP TALKING.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.585
I LEFT DURING SHORTCAKE.

20:52.626 --> 20:53.961
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.588
HEY, GRANDMA DID THIS.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.588
YOU DIDN'T.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.506
I KNOW, I JUST HATE THAT

20:55.629 --> 20:57.506
YOU'RE FIGHTING WITH THEM.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.008
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.551
SHE'S SLEEPING.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.763
UH-HUH. YEAH, WELL, WE

21:00.593 --> 21:03.763
PARTIED PRETTY HARD TONIGHT.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.556
DO WE WAKE HER UP?

21:05.598 --> 21:06.891
NO, WE'LL WAIT A MINUTE.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.475
MOM, CAN YOU...?

21:08.517 --> 21:10.853
WHAT?

21:10.895 --> 21:13.231
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.356
IS IT ABOUT GRANDMA?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.568
DO I HAVE TO ASK

21:15.900 --> 21:17.568
18 MORE OF THESE?

21:17.610 --> 21:20.362
YOU KNOW HOW WITH DEAN

21:17.610 --> 21:20.362
THINGS DIDN'T EXACTLY GO

21:20.404 --> 21:21.781
THE WAY I PLANNED?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.407
YOU MEAN WITH YOU AND HIM

21:21.822 --> 21:23.407
GETTING TOGETHER?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.534
NO, I MEAN --

21:23.449 --> 21:25.534
YES, THAT, TOO --

21:25.576 --> 21:27.870
BUT I PROMISED YOU THAT I WOULD

21:25.576 --> 21:27.870
COME TO YOU AND TALK TO YOU

21:27.912 --> 21:30.206
WHEN I THOUGHT

21:27.912 --> 21:30.206
I WAS READY TO...

21:30.248 --> 21:33.292
BUT I DIDN'T BECAUSE IT

21:30.248 --> 21:33.292
ALL HAPPENED SO FAST,

21:33.333 --> 21:34.668
AND I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE,

21:34.710 --> 21:37.421
AND THEN EVERYTHING

21:34.710 --> 21:37.421
GOT SO MESSED UP,

21:37.463 --> 21:38.798
AND THEN AFTER,

21:37.463 --> 21:38.798
IT WAS WEIRD.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.466
THE SITUATION WAS WEIRD.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.093
I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

21:40.507 --> 21:42.093
COMING TO TALK TO YOU

21:42.135 --> 21:43.803
ABOUT ANYTHING

21:42.135 --> 21:43.803
CONCERNING US AT ALL.

21:43.844 --> 21:46.055
YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK TO ME,

21:43.844 --> 21:46.055
EVEN WHEN IT'S WEIRD.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.599
I WANT TO GO BACK TO TALKING

21:46.097 --> 21:48.599
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

21:48.641 --> 21:49.642
JUST LIKE BEFORE DEAN.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.102
I SECOND THAT MOTION.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.895
I THOUGHT I WOULD TALK

21:51.144 --> 21:52.895
TO YOU NOW ABOUT LOGAN.

21:52.937 --> 21:54.897
OH, OKAY.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.565
I WANT TO TELL YOU NOW

21:56.607 --> 21:59.318
SO YOU HEAR IT FROM ME

21:56.607 --> 21:59.318
RIGHT WHEN IT'S STARTING.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.612
RIGHT WHEN IT'S STARTING.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.612
OH, GOT IT.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.240
SO THE TWO OF YOU

22:01.654 --> 22:04.240
ARE STARTING SOMETHING, HUH?

22:04.282 --> 22:07.409
YES. WE HAVE DEFINITELY

22:04.282 --> 22:07.409
STARTED SOMETHING.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.828
STARTED.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.037
OH, YOU'VE ALREADY

22:08.869 --> 22:10.037
STARTED SOMETHING.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.622
WOW.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.622
OKAY, FAST.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.958
I KNOW, BUT HE'S SO GREAT.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.958
YOU'VE SEEN HIM.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.210
HE'S BEAUTIFUL

22:14.000 --> 22:16.210
AND REALLY SMART.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.377
SMARTER THAN ME, I SWEAR.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.297
AND HE'S GREAT.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.840
YES, HE SEEMS GREAT.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.258
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON,

22:20.881 --> 22:22.258
WHICH IS GOOD.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.467
VERY GOOD.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.511
THE PAPER AND YALE,

22:23.509 --> 22:25.511
OF COURSE.

22:25.552 --> 22:27.471
HE'S EXTREMELY WELL-READ.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.974
AND I KNOW LOGAN'S RICH, AND

22:27.513 --> 22:29.974
I KNOW YOU DON'T REALLY --

22:30.016 --> 22:32.643
I DON'T CARE IF HE'S RICH.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.643
IF YOU LIKE HIM --

22:32.685 --> 22:33.853
I DO.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.853
I REALLY LIKE HIM.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.104
AND HE'S TREATING YOU WELL.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.315
HE IS.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.315
I'M HAVING FUN.

22:37.397 --> 22:38.941
A LOT OF FUN.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.194
OKAY, WELL, IF HE'S

22:38.983 --> 22:41.194
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU,

22:41.235 --> 22:44.488
I SHOULD PROBABLY

22:41.235 --> 22:44.488
MEET HIM AGAIN

22:44.530 --> 22:46.573
UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.783
RIGHT.

22:47.825 --> 22:48.909
EVERYTHING ALL

22:47.825 --> 22:48.909
BUTTONED AND ZIPPED.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.119
YOU WILL.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.119
I PROMISE.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.411
GOOD.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.411
THAT'S GOOD.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.914
ANYHOW, I JUST

22:51.453 --> 22:53.914
WANTED YOU TO KNOW.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.333
OKAY.

22:55.373 --> 22:58.669
SO...GOOD TALK.

22:55.373 --> 22:58.669
YEAH?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.587
ABSOLUTELY.

23:00.629 --> 23:03.341
MAN, I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BUY

23:00.629 --> 23:03.341
YOU A SHOT OR SOMETHING.

23:03.381 --> 23:04.591
HOW ABOUT A RUM BALL?

23:04.633 --> 23:06.426
TWO RUM BALLS COMING UP.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.016
HELLO.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.517
Richard: Lorelai,

23:12.058 --> 23:13.517
it's your father.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.561
HELLO, THERE, MY FATHER.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.561
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

23:15.602 --> 23:17.938
YOU CAN TAKE A MORE

23:15.602 --> 23:17.938
SERIOUS TONE FOR STARTERS.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.607
[ British accent ]

23:17.980 --> 23:20.607
OH, HELLO, MY FATHER.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.607
Lorelai.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.693
[ Normal ] SORRY,

23:20.649 --> 23:22.693
I THOUGHT THE BRITISH

23:20.649 --> 23:22.693
THING MADE IT SERIOUS.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.612
I ASSUME YOU HEARD WHAT

23:22.735 --> 23:25.612
HAPPENED AT DINNER LAST NIGHT.

23:25.654 --> 23:26.697
DID IT INVOLVE A FORK?

23:26.739 --> 23:27.698
No, it did not.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.325
IT INVOLVED YOUR DAUGHTER

23:29.367 --> 23:31.535
BEING INCREDIBLY RUDE AND

23:29.367 --> 23:31.535
INSENSITIVE TO HER GRANDMOTHER.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.996
I HEARD THERE WAS A BIT

23:31.577 --> 23:33.996
OF A FLARE-UP THERE, YES.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.373
IT WAS MORE THAN A FLARE-UP.

23:35.413 --> 23:36.874
I'VE NEVER SEEN

23:35.413 --> 23:36.874
RORY BEHAVE LIKE THAT.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.416
WELL, SHE WAS UPSET, DAD.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.211
WELL, THAT IS NO EXCUSE.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.587
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.547
TELL ME WHAT YOU INTEND

23:41.628 --> 23:43.547
TO DO ABOUT IT.

23:43.589 --> 23:44.631
NOTHING.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.716
You have to talk to her.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.759
NO, I DO NOT.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.261
LORELAI, YOU ARE HER MOTHER.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.596
IT IS UP TO YOU TO SET

23:48.302 --> 23:50.596
AN EXAMPLE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.098
I DID SET AN EXAMPLE, DAD.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.682
I DIDN'T GO TO DINNER.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.682
SHE WENT ANYHOW.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.351
DAMN KIDS.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.351
CAN'T TEACH 'EM ANYTHING.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.311
SHE YELLED AT

23:55.393 --> 23:57.311
HER GRANDMOTHER, LORELAI,

23:57.353 --> 23:59.355
AT THE DINNER TABLE

23:57.353 --> 23:59.355
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

23:59.397 --> 24:00.564
THIS IS NONE

23:59.397 --> 24:00.564
OF MY BUSINESS.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.024
OF COURSE IT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.609
IT'S YOUR BATTLE

24:02.066 --> 24:03.609
SHE'S FIGHTING.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.361
I DO NOT HAVE A BATTLE.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.406
YOU NEED TO TALK TO HER AND TELL

24:05.403 --> 24:08.406
HER THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT --

24:08.446 --> 24:10.324
LISTEN TO ME.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.324
THIS IS RORY'S THING, OKAY?

24:10.366 --> 24:11.784
SHE WAS MAD.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.784
SHE WAS UPSET.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.327
WHAT DOES RORY

24:11.825 --> 24:13.327
HAVE TO BE UPSET ABOUT?

24:13.369 --> 24:14.912
RORY LOVES LUKE, DAD.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.789
SHE DID NOT WANT TO SEE HIM

24:14.954 --> 24:16.789
HUMILIATED LIKE HE WAS.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.124
SHE CARES ABOUT ME.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.959
YOUR MOTHER DID

24:18.165 --> 24:19.959
WHAT SHE THOUGHT --

24:20.000 --> 24:21.585
WHOA, OKAY.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.585
JUST STOP RIGHT THERE.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.712
I'M NOT INTERESTED

24:21.627 --> 24:23.712
IN WHY MOM DID WHAT SHE DID.

24:23.754 --> 24:24.922
BUT I WAS JUST --

24:24.964 --> 24:26.215
Luke and I

24:24.964 --> 24:26.215
have broken up, Dad.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.674
WE ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER.

24:27.716 --> 24:30.010
AND IT IS A DIRECT RESULT

24:27.716 --> 24:30.010
OF WHAT MOM DID,

24:30.052 --> 24:31.387
AND I KNOW THAT

24:30.052 --> 24:31.387
YOU COULD CARE LESS,

24:31.429 --> 24:32.888
AND I KNOW THAT

24:31.429 --> 24:32.888
MOM WILL BE THRILLED.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.975
BUT I AM NOT THRILLED.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.975
AND RORY'S NOT THRILLED.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.936
WE'RE BOTH HURT

24:36.016 --> 24:38.936
AND EXTREMELY UPSET.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.688
NOW, I CAN STAY AWAY AND NOT

24:38.978 --> 24:41.688
COME TO DINNER AND NOT SEE MOM,

24:41.730 --> 24:43.690
BUT RORY MADE A DEAL

24:41.730 --> 24:43.690
WITH YOU GUYS,

24:43.732 --> 24:45.567
AND RORY NEVER GOES BACK

24:43.732 --> 24:45.567
ON ANYTHING SHE SAYS,

24:45.609 --> 24:47.069
SO SHE WENT, SHE WAS THERE,

24:47.111 --> 24:49.280
AND IF SHE WAS RUDE OR COLD,

24:47.111 --> 24:49.280
THEN I'M SORRY.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.073
BUT I PERSONALLY FEEL

24:49.322 --> 24:51.073
SHE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO BE.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.616
YOU AND MOM WILL JUST

24:51.115 --> 24:52.616
HAVE TO WORK THAT OUT

24:52.658 --> 24:53.617
WITH HER YOURSELVES.

24:53.659 --> 24:54.994
SO THEN THIS IS IT?

24:55.035 --> 24:56.203
YOU'LL NEVER VISIT

24:55.035 --> 24:56.203
OUR HOME AGAIN?

24:56.245 --> 24:57.204
I DON'T KNOW.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.747
You'll send Rory,

24:58.789 --> 25:00.749
BUT YOU'LL AVOID US AT

24:58.789 --> 25:00.749
THANKSGIVING, ON CHRISTMAS.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.168
PROBABLY.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.461
So we're just supposed

25:02.209 --> 25:03.461
to accept the fact

25:03.501 --> 25:04.753
THAT WE'LL

25:03.501 --> 25:04.753
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN?

25:04.795 --> 25:06.713
YOU CAN SEE ME

25:04.795 --> 25:06.713
ANY TIME YOU WANT, DAD.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.798
I HAVE NO BEEF WITH YOU.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.383
I SEE.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.093
WELL.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.762
UH, DAD? WHILE YOU'RE ALL

25:11.135 --> 25:13.762
CALM AND QUIET THERE,

25:13.804 --> 25:14.763
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

25:14.805 --> 25:16.307
Go ahead.

25:16.349 --> 25:18.851
THE PREMIUM ON MY INSURANCE

25:16.349 --> 25:18.851
POLICY AT THE INN

25:18.892 --> 25:22.313
IS GOING UP 15% BECAUSE OF

25:18.892 --> 25:22.313
SOME SMALL-DAMAGE CLAIMS.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.316
I'M SORRY, YOU'RE ASKING ME

25:22.355 --> 25:25.316
A QUESTION ABOUT INSURANCE?

25:25.358 --> 25:26.733
Yeah.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.402
CARRY ON.

25:28.444 --> 25:31.529
SO, THESE GUYS CAME BY THE INN

25:28.444 --> 25:31.529
LAST WEEK, AND -- OH.

25:31.571 --> 25:34.200
DAD, I'VE GOTTA CALL YOU

25:31.571 --> 25:34.200
BACK IN A SEC, OKAY?

25:34.241 --> 25:35.575
THANKS, BYE.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.870
EXCUSE ME!

25:35.617 --> 25:37.870
HELLO, HI!

25:37.911 --> 25:39.663
IS THIS YOUR BOAT?

25:39.705 --> 25:41.874
UH, TECHNICALLY IT IS, YEAH,

25:41.915 --> 25:43.501
AND I'M SORRY THAT IT'S PARKED

25:41.915 --> 25:43.501
OUT HERE LIKE THIS,

25:43.541 --> 25:46.504
BUT SEE, IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE

25:43.541 --> 25:46.504
AUCTIONED OFF FOR CHARITY

25:46.544 --> 25:48.088
FOR THE "NATIONAL BOATING

25:46.544 --> 25:48.088
FOR PEACE

25:48.130 --> 25:51.384
AND LOW BLOOD SUGAR

25:48.130 --> 25:51.384
ORGANIZATION FOR TINY CHILDREN,"

25:51.425 --> 25:55.095
AND SO THEY DELIVERED IT

25:51.425 --> 25:55.095
EARLY AND NOT FINISHED,

25:55.137 --> 25:57.306
AND SO IT WAS DROPPED OFF HERE

25:55.137 --> 25:57.306
TO BE PICKED UP

25:57.348 --> 25:59.225
BY THE BOAT-FINISHING GUYS.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.601
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MOVE IT, BUT

25:59.266 --> 26:01.601
THERE WAS THIS KITTEN IN A TREE.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.770
HE HAD A COLD, AND I HAD

26:01.643 --> 26:03.770
TO BRING HIM KLEENEX AND --

26:03.812 --> 26:05.814
JUST MOVE IT

26:03.812 --> 26:05.814
ON STREET-CLEANING DAYS.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.565
YES, MA'AM.

26:15.491 --> 26:16.950
YOU WANT

26:15.491 --> 26:16.950
SOME KETCHUP, KIRK?

26:16.992 --> 26:18.285
NO, THANKS.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.912
THE DISTINCT CHARRED

26:18.327 --> 26:19.912
FLAVOR OF THIS MEAT

26:19.953 --> 26:21.539
IS LIKE A DELICACY.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.457
I WOULDN'T DREAM OF

26:21.579 --> 26:23.457
OBSCURING IT WITH CONDIMENTS.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.042
THAT'S A PANCAKE.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.626
FASCINATING.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.754
LUKE, MY CHEESEBURGER

26:26.668 --> 26:28.754
AND FRIES UP YET?

26:28.795 --> 26:30.714
HOW WOULD I KNOW?

26:28.795 --> 26:30.714
WHAT AM I, A FOOD PSYCHIC?

26:30.756 --> 26:32.674
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW

26:30.756 --> 26:32.674
HOW THE GRAPEFRUIT CROP'S

26:32.716 --> 26:34.218
GONNA BE THIS YEAR?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.178
HOLD ON, I'M GETTING

26:34.260 --> 26:36.178
A MESSAGE FROM A KUMQUAT

26:36.220 --> 26:37.304

26:37.346 --> 26:38.764
I'LL GO SEE FOR MYSELF.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.724
HEY, LUKE,

26:38.805 --> 26:40.724
CAN I GET A NAPKIN?

26:42.851 --> 26:45.938
A CLOTH NAPKIN AND A MOIST

26:42.851 --> 26:45.938
TOWELETTE ALL IN ONE.

26:45.979 --> 26:49.442
I'VE GOT A DELIVERY.

26:45.979 --> 26:49.442
BE RIGHT BACK.

26:49.483 --> 26:50.859
SIT ANYWHERE?

26:50.901 --> 26:52.861
YEAH, LISTEN,

26:50.901 --> 26:52.861
I WILL BE BACK IN 15 MINUTES.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.988
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT

26:52.903 --> 26:54.988
AND LET ME SEAT YOU THEN?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.198
WHAT?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.198
JUST TRUST ME.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.783
FORGET IT.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.783
I'M HUNGRY NOW.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.617
OKAY, ANYWHERE'S FINE.

26:59.659 --> 27:00.618
THANKS.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.589
UNH!

27:19.138 --> 27:20.389
SOUP'S ON.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.349
OH, THANK GOD.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.349
I'M STARVING.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.810
I'VE BEEN DREAMING ABOUT LUKE'S

27:22.391 --> 27:24.810
CHEESEBURGERS FOR A MONTH.

27:24.851 --> 27:26.061
HOW'S THE INVENTORY COMING?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.896
PERFECT.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.896
I HAVE A GREAT SYSTEM GOING.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.607
THIS IS MY

27:27.938 --> 27:29.607
"TO BE WRITTEN DOWN" PILE,

27:29.689 --> 27:31.191
MY "ALREADY

27:29.689 --> 27:31.191
WRITTEN DOWN" PILE,

27:31.233 --> 27:33.444
AND THIS IS MY PILE OF BOOKS

27:31.233 --> 27:33.444
THAT I NOW HAVE TO BUY.

27:33.486 --> 27:34.778
THAT'S A BIG PILE.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.863
BIGGER THAN

27:34.820 --> 27:36.863
THE OTHER TWO PILES.

27:36.905 --> 27:39.283
THIS JOB MUST BE

27:36.905 --> 27:39.283
COSTING YOU A FORTUNE.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.496
OH, MY GOD.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.871
WHAT IS THAT THING?

27:44.913 --> 27:46.373
SORRY,

27:44.913 --> 27:46.373
I SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.250
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.250
THIS IS FROM LUKE'S?

27:48.292 --> 27:50.085
YEAH, HE'S BEEN

27:48.292 --> 27:50.085
A LITTLE OFF HIS GAME LATELY.

27:50.127 --> 27:52.463
IT'S LIKE TIGER WOODS

27:50.127 --> 27:52.463
MADE THIS THING.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.089
LUKE'S BEEN IN A MOOD.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.591
AND HE'S TAKING IT OUT

27:54.131 --> 27:55.591
ON THE CHEESEBURGERS?

27:55.633 --> 27:57.593
EVERYTHING'S EITHER BEEN

27:55.633 --> 27:57.593
BURNT OR DROPPED.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.303
HE'S ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.263
HE JUST MOPES AND GROWLS

27:59.345 --> 28:01.263
AND STOMPS AROUND.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.764
HE THROWS CUSTOMERS

28:01.305 --> 28:02.764
OUT THE DOOR.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.764
JEEZ.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.476
I'M ASSUMING HIS MOOD

28:02.806 --> 28:05.476
MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

28:05.518 --> 28:07.936
WITH A CERTAIN SOMEONE WHO'S

28:05.518 --> 28:07.936
BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF HER TIME

28:07.978 --> 28:08.937
AT WESTON'S LATELY.

28:08.979 --> 28:10.772
OH, POOR SAD LUKE.

28:10.814 --> 28:11.898
POOR SAD TIPS.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.108
I HAVE TO EAT.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.610
YOU WANT TO RUN

28:13.150 --> 28:14.610
OVER TO AL'S?

28:14.652 --> 28:15.653
CAN'T. IF LUKE'S

28:14.652 --> 28:15.653
LEFT ALONE TOO LONG,

28:15.693 --> 28:17.112
HE MIGHT BURN THE PLACE DOWN.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.572
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

28:17.154 --> 28:18.572
YOU WANNA DO SOMETHING?

28:18.614 --> 28:20.324
I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT

28:18.614 --> 28:20.324
ZACH IS COOKING ME DINNER.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.784
REALLY?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.784
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.161
IT IS, ISN'T IT?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.787
IT'S SO NICE

28:24.203 --> 28:25.787
THAT YOU HAVE ZACH.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.623
IT'S LIKE HAVING A PERFECT

28:25.829 --> 28:27.623
HAIRCUT EVERY SINGLE DAY.

28:27.665 --> 28:29.082
MY GOD, THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.459
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

28:30.501 --> 28:31.544
OKAY, THANKS

28:30.501 --> 28:31.544
FOR THE CONCEPT OF LUNCH.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.962
ANY TIME.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.632
HMM.

28:36.674 --> 28:39.259

28:49.478 --> 28:51.855

28:53.440 --> 28:55.108
COLLEEN,

28:53.440 --> 28:55.108

29:08.706 --> 29:10.207

OH, WELL, SEPTEMBER

29:10.249 --> 29:12.959
WILL PROBABLY WORK.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.337
AND YOU'RE JOKING.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.005
AUGUST 14th

29:15.379 --> 29:17.005

29:17.047 --> 29:18.298
OH, YAY!

29:18.340 --> 29:20.884

WHY DON'T YOU GO AND CHECK

29:20.926 --> 29:23.262

29:23.303 --> 29:24.930
I'LL BE UP IN A MOMENT.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.682
WELL, IS IT BAD?

29:24.971 --> 29:26.682
IS IT GOOD?

29:26.724 --> 29:28.434
AM I SCREWED?

29:26.724 --> 29:28.434
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:28.475 --> 29:30.644
PHILIP AND I HAVE THOROUGHLY

29:28.475 --> 29:30.644
TOURED THE PROPERTY,

29:30.686 --> 29:34.147
AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

29:30.686 --> 29:34.147
ONE TOO MANY GARDEN GNOMES,

29:34.189 --> 29:36.149
WE HAVE FOUND IT

29:34.189 --> 29:36.149
TO BE IN TOP SHAPE.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.443
REALLY?

29:36.191 --> 29:37.443
YES.

29:37.484 --> 29:39.194
I'VE ALSO REVIEWED

29:37.484 --> 29:39.194
YOUR POLICY.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.655
AND WHILE I TIP MY HAT

29:39.236 --> 29:41.655
TO THE CRIMINAL GENIUS

29:41.697 --> 29:44.366
WHO CONVINCED YOU TO SIGN IT,

29:41.697 --> 29:44.366
I FIND IT APPALLING.

29:44.408 --> 29:45.867
I KNEW THE NAME

29:44.408 --> 29:45.867
SHYSTY McSHYSTERSON

29:45.909 --> 29:47.160
SHOULD HAVE TIPPED ME OFF.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.621
YOU CAN DO BETTER,

29:47.202 --> 29:48.621
AND I CAN HELP.

29:48.662 --> 29:49.663
DON'T YOU TEASE ME,

29:48.662 --> 29:49.663
GILMORE.

29:49.705 --> 29:50.997
OH, NO, I WOULDN'T DARE.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.416
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

29:52.458 --> 29:53.500
PHILIP WILL GO OVER

29:52.458 --> 29:53.500

29:55.252 --> 29:57.129

29:57.170 --> 29:58.505
OH, MY GOD.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.505
YOU'RE MY LIFE-SAVER.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.340
HEY, CAN I MAKE

29:58.547 --> 30:00.340

30:00.382 --> 30:01.634
NO, THANK YOU, SOOKIE.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.260
COME ON, DAD.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.260

30:03.302 --> 30:05.345
I'LL HAVE SOME COFFEE

30:03.302 --> 30:05.345
IF YOU'RE OFFERING.

30:05.387 --> 30:06.722
WE'RE OFFERING.

30:06.764 --> 30:07.889
I'LL HEAT UP

30:06.764 --> 30:07.889
SOME SCONES TO GO WITH IT.

30:07.931 --> 30:09.349
OH, NO, I DON'T WANT --

30:09.391 --> 30:10.892
FORGET IT, DAD.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.892
YOU'RE GETTING SCONES.

30:10.934 --> 30:13.353
MY GOD,

30:10.934 --> 30:13.353
THIS IS A BOSSY PLACE.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.397
YOU KNOW,

30:13.395 --> 30:15.397
I HAVE TO SAY, LORELAI,

30:15.439 --> 30:16.856
YOU'VE DONE

30:15.439 --> 30:16.856
A WONDERFUL JOB HERE.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.400
THANK YOU, DAD.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.570
WELL, THE RESTORATION,

30:18.442 --> 30:21.570
THE ROOMS, THE HOMEY FEEL.

30:21.612 --> 30:23.656
AND THE STABLES --

30:21.612 --> 30:23.656
VERY SMART.

30:23.697 --> 30:24.990
PEOPLE LOVE HORSES.

30:25.031 --> 30:27.785
THEY TURNED OUT

30:25.031 --> 30:27.785
TO BE QUITE A DRAW.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.620
YOU KNOW,

30:27.826 --> 30:29.620
SMALL INNS LIKE THIS

30:29.662 --> 30:31.455
ARE VERY FASHIONABLE

30:29.662 --> 30:31.455
RIGHT NOW.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.791
THE LARGER HOTEL CHAINS

30:31.497 --> 30:33.791
ARE CONSTANTLY SEARCHING

30:33.832 --> 30:36.042
TO ACQUIRE CHARMING PLACES

30:33.832 --> 30:36.042
LIKE THIS.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.377
THEY KEEP THEM

30:36.084 --> 30:37.377
JUST AS THEY ARE.

30:37.419 --> 30:40.088
THEY USUALLY RETAIN

30:37.419 --> 30:40.088
THE MANAGEMENT.

30:40.130 --> 30:43.634
I COULD DO A LITTLE SNIFFING

30:40.130 --> 30:43.634
AROUND FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE.

30:43.676 --> 30:46.052
ARE YOU TALKING

30:43.676 --> 30:46.052
ABOUT SELLING MY INN?

30:46.094 --> 30:48.806
YOU WOULD STILL RUN IT, BUT

30:46.094 --> 30:48.806
YOU'D MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.140
I'M GOOD, DAD.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.767
YOU SHOULD

30:50.182 --> 30:51.767
REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

30:51.809 --> 30:53.602
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE

30:51.809 --> 30:53.602
SELLING THIS PLACE,

30:53.644 --> 30:55.103
BUT THANK YOU

30:53.644 --> 30:55.103
FOR THE SUGGESTION.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.189
YES, WELL,

30:55.145 --> 30:57.189
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND...

30:57.230 --> 30:59.065
YES, I KNOW

30:57.230 --> 30:59.065
WHERE TO FIND YOU.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.193
OH, MY, WHAT

30:59.107 --> 31:01.193
IS THAT HEAVENLY SMELL?

31:01.234 --> 31:02.820
SCONES.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.155
I HAVE NEVER SMELLED ANYTHING

31:02.861 --> 31:05.155
AS HEAVENLY AS THIS.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.156
WAIT TILL YOU TASTE THEM.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.741
MORE BUBBLY, MY DEAR?

31:07.783 --> 31:09.075
PLEASE.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.577
I OPENED THE BOTTLE

31:09.117 --> 31:10.577
THIS AFTERNOON,

31:10.619 --> 31:13.205
SO IT'S JUST THE WAY YOU

31:10.619 --> 31:13.205
LIKE IT, NICE AND FLAT.

31:13.246 --> 31:14.832
THIS WHOLE THING

31:13.246 --> 31:14.832
WAS SO SWEET, ZACH.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.915
COOKING ME DINNER.

31:15.957 --> 31:16.958
IT WAS FUN.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.001
THE SAUCE WAS AMAZING.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.378
MY OWN CREATION.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.547
RAGU WITH GARLIC SALT,

31:19.419 --> 31:21.547
CAYENNE PEPPER,

31:21.588 --> 31:22.589
AND A DASH OF WASABI.

31:22.631 --> 31:23.716
IT MADE MY EARS POP.

31:23.757 --> 31:24.924
ONE OF THE BENEFITS.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.510
THE SPAGHETTI

31:24.966 --> 31:26.510
WAS JUST RIGHT, TOO.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.762
I THREW SOME UP AGAINST THE WALL

31:26.552 --> 31:28.762
TO TELL IF IT WAS DONE.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.056
IT MADE A SHAPE LIKE PETER

31:28.804 --> 31:31.056
GABRIEL'S BIG BLOATED HEAD.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.224
IT'S STILL THERE

31:31.097 --> 31:32.224
IF YOU WANNA SEE IT.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.059
YEAH, COOL.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.227
BUT NOT NOW, OKAY?

31:35.268 --> 31:37.688
LATER.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.022
OH, SURE.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.193
YOU'RE THE BEST, YOU KNOW?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.362
THE COOLEST.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.572
THE CUTEST.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.365
OH, THANKS.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.365
BACK AT YOU.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.116
I LIKED YOU

31:48.407 --> 31:50.116
THE DAY I MET YOU.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.035
I EVEN REMEMBER

31:50.158 --> 31:52.035
WHAT YOU WERE WEARING.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.995
OH, GOD, I PROBABLY

31:52.077 --> 31:53.995
LOOKED LIKE A PIG.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.205
I NEED MORE CLOTHES.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.165
I WANT THIS TO BE RIGHT,

31:55.247 --> 31:57.165
YOU KNOW?

31:57.207 --> 31:59.042
YEAH.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.042
ABSOLUTELY.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.753
THE MUSIC'S GOOD FOR YOU?

32:00.794 --> 32:02.421
SURE.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.136
THAT WAS NICE.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.473
YEAH, IT WAS.

32:13.515 --> 32:16.393
WE SHOULD PROBABLY

32:13.515 --> 32:16.393
CLEAR THE PLATES, RIGHT?

32:13.515 --> 32:16.393
WHAT?

32:16.435 --> 32:17.603
JUST TO GET THEM SOAKING.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.606
NO.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.606
UH, LATER.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.190
AFTER.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.777
OKAY.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.777
AFTER WHAT?

32:24.818 --> 32:26.069
AFTER.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.529
RIGHT.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.574
AFTER.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.784
MM-HMM.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.915
OH, MY GOD!

32:36.329 --> 32:37.915
WHAT?

32:37.956 --> 32:39.082
YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.166
KIND OF.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.752
OH, MY GOD!

32:41.794 --> 32:43.712
YOU DIDN'T KNOW

32:41.794 --> 32:43.712
WHERE THIS WAS HEADING?

32:43.754 --> 32:45.004
HOW COULD I HAVE KNOWN, ZACH?

32:45.046 --> 32:46.214
I THOUGHT IT WAS CLEAR.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.299
HOW? HOW?

32:47.340 --> 32:48.759
I COOKED.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.759
I NEVER COOK.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.343
I DON'T KNOW

32:48.801 --> 32:50.343
THAT YOU'VE NEVER COOKED.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.053
I'VE KNOWN YOU --

32:50.385 --> 32:52.053
WHAT, TWO YEARS?

32:52.095 --> 32:53.263
THIS COULD BE

32:52.095 --> 32:53.263
A DORMANT HOBBY.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.723
I LIT CANDLES.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.934
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING

32:54.765 --> 32:56.934
TO SAVE ON ELECTRICITY.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.352
I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO HAVE

32:56.975 --> 32:59.352
A SPECIAL EVENING WITH YOU.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.938
LIKE THAT'S A CLUE?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.106
I DON'T SAY CRAP LIKE,

33:00.979 --> 33:03.106
"SPECIAL EVENING," LANE!

33:03.148 --> 33:04.733
I PLAY GUITAR!

33:04.775 --> 33:07.611
I LINED THE PATH TO THE

33:04.775 --> 33:07.611
BEDROOM DOOR WITH ROSE PETALS.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.737
YOU HAD TO HAVE SEEN THAT.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.155
I THOUGHT YOU TRACKED THEM IN.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.698
YOU'RE ALWAYS STEPPING IN

33:10.196 --> 33:11.698
THINGS, ZACH.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.659
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE

33:11.740 --> 33:13.659
I COULD'VE DONE.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.118
YEAH, WELL, NEITHER DO I.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.578
WHAT?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.872
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU GAVE ME,

33:16.620 --> 33:18.872
LIKE, 83 CLUES,

33:18.914 --> 33:20.206
AND I MISSED THEM ALL.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.206
I'M STUPID.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.416
YOU'RE NOT.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.293
I WAS JUST

33:21.458 --> 33:23.293
TRYING TO BE SUBTLE,

33:23.335 --> 33:24.753
AND THAT'S NOT MY THING.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.964
I'M BAD.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.964
I'M A BAD MAN!

33:27.005 --> 33:29.090
YOU'RE NOT BAD.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.090
YOU'RE GOOD.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.425
I'M STUPID.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.177
I PUSHED YOU.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.177
I SHOULD BE ARRESTED.

33:32.218 --> 33:34.346
NO, ZACH.

33:34.387 --> 33:36.222
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.392
WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR --

33:36.264 --> 33:39.392
WHAT, FOUR MONTHS?

33:39.434 --> 33:42.228
AND WE LIVE TOGETHER,

33:39.434 --> 33:42.228
AND I'M 20.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.106
AND YOU'RE A GUY,

33:42.270 --> 33:45.106
AND I'M A GIRL,

33:45.148 --> 33:49.319
AND BIRDS DO IT,

33:45.148 --> 33:49.319
AND BEES DO IT.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.155
SO...WHAT DO YOU THINK?

33:52.197 --> 33:54.199
I HAVE TO WAIT

33:52.197 --> 33:54.199
TILL I GET MARRIED.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.199
WHAT?

33:54.240 --> 33:55.826
"I HAVE TO WAIT

33:54.240 --> 33:55.826
TILL I GET MARRIED"?

33:55.868 --> 33:57.035
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.035
NEITHER DID I.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.537
WHOA.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.537
YEAH, WHOA.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.163
I DON'T KNOW

33:58.578 --> 34:00.163
IF I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

34:00.205 --> 34:03.333
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M OKAY

34:00.205 --> 34:03.333
WITH THAT, EITHER.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.460
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.460
CLEANING UP.

34:05.502 --> 34:06.962
I'LL DO IT.

34:07.004 --> 34:08.338
NO, ZACH, YOU'RE NOT

34:07.004 --> 34:08.338
GETTING ANY TONIGHT.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.215
THE LEAST I COULD DO

34:08.380 --> 34:10.215
IS CLEAN UP.

34:17.890 --> 34:20.017
Richard: EMILY,

34:20.058 --> 34:23.436
I DON'T BELIEVE WE'D

34:20.058 --> 34:23.436
FINISHED TALKING ABOUT THIS.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.899
I THINK ONCE YOU TAKE A STEP

34:23.478 --> 34:26.899
BACK AND THINK ABOUT THIS,

34:26.940 --> 34:29.317
YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE'S

34:26.940 --> 34:29.317
NOTHING TO BE UPSET ABOUT.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.819
I'M NOT UPSET, RICHARD.

34:30.861 --> 34:31.862
YOU'RE NOT.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.196
NO, I AM NOT.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.198
THAT FLOWER JUST

34:33.238 --> 34:35.198
HAD IT COMING, I ASSUME.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.366
YOU'RE LOVING THIS,

34:35.240 --> 34:36.366
AREN'T YOU?

34:36.408 --> 34:37.534
LOVING WHAT?

34:37.576 --> 34:38.952
RORY WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME,

34:38.994 --> 34:40.620
BUT IT'S, "GRANDPA,

34:38.994 --> 34:40.620
HOW WAS GREECE?"

34:40.662 --> 34:42.330
AND "GRANDPA,

34:40.662 --> 34:42.330
I JUST LOVE MY GIFT."

34:42.372 --> 34:44.457
OH, NOW, EMILY.

34:44.499 --> 34:46.668
LORELAI WON'T TAKE MY

34:44.499 --> 34:46.668
CALLS BUT RUNS TO DADDY

34:44.499 --> 34:46.668
WITH HER INSURANCE PROBLEMS.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.795
HER INSURANCE COMPANY'S

34:46.710 --> 34:48.795
BEEN ROBBING HER BLIND.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.881
PLEASE.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.881
WOULD YOU LIKE

34:48.837 --> 34:50.881
TO SEE HER POLICY?

34:50.923 --> 34:52.007
THE DEDUCTIBLE ALONE --

34:52.049 --> 34:53.508
YOU'RE THE FAVORITE,

34:53.550 --> 34:55.176
AND YOU'RE LOVING

34:53.550 --> 34:55.176
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF IT.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.762
THIS IS NOT

34:55.218 --> 34:56.762
A POPULARITY CONTEST.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.680
NO, NOT A CONTEST.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.680
YOU ALREADY WON.

34:58.722 --> 35:00.849
EMILY, YOU ARE ACTING

34:58.722 --> 35:00.849
INCREDIBLY IMMATURE.

35:00.891 --> 35:03.268
YOU COULDN'T WAIT TO RUN

35:00.891 --> 35:03.268
OVER TO THAT INN OF HERS

35:03.309 --> 35:04.978
FOR YOUR SECRET

35:03.309 --> 35:04.978
CLANDESTINE MEETING.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.396
HOW CLANDESTINE

35:05.020 --> 35:06.396
COULD IT BE?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.023
I JUST TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.

35:08.065 --> 35:10.650
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

35:08.065 --> 35:10.650
REFUSE TO STAND BY ME ON THIS.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.778
WHY HAVEN'T WE

35:10.692 --> 35:12.778
GOTTEN STOOLS IN HERE?!

35:12.819 --> 35:15.405
I DID WHAT I DID

35:12.819 --> 35:15.405
FOR HER OWN GOOD.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.449
I ONLY WANT THE BEST FOR HER,

35:15.447 --> 35:17.449
AND SINCE SHE IS INCAPABLE

35:17.490 --> 35:21.286
OF JUDGING WHAT IS RIGHT AND

35:17.490 --> 35:21.286
WHAT IS WRONG, I HAD TO STEP IN.

35:21.327 --> 35:23.580
YES, YOU DID.

35:21.327 --> 35:23.580
YOU ACTED, AND IT BACKFIRED.

35:23.622 --> 35:24.915
RICHARD.

35:24.957 --> 35:26.499
IT WAS A NOBLE EFFORT,

35:24.957 --> 35:26.499
BUT IT FAILED.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.377
NOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

35:26.541 --> 35:29.377
THE REALITY IN FRONT OF US.

35:29.419 --> 35:32.464
HOWEVER MISGUIDED LORELAI'S

35:29.419 --> 35:32.464
FEELINGS ARE RIGHT NOW,

35:32.505 --> 35:35.174
THE FACT IS, SHE IS NOT

35:32.505 --> 35:35.174
WILLING TO DEAL WITH YOU.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.135
SHE WILL, HOWEVER,

35:35.216 --> 35:37.135
DEAL WITH ME.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.888
AND AT LEAST THIS WAY, WE

35:37.176 --> 35:39.888
STILL HAVE CONTACT WITH HER.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.640
CONTACT.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.640
PLEASE.

35:41.681 --> 35:44.768
AND HOPEFULLY, WITH TIME, WE

35:41.681 --> 35:44.768
WILL BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HER

35:44.810 --> 35:46.895
TO COME BACK, AND THINGS

35:44.810 --> 35:46.895
WILL RETURN TO NORMAL.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.690
HOWEVER, IF WE SIMPLY CUT HER

35:46.937 --> 35:50.690
OFF -- NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER --

35:50.732 --> 35:53.735
THEN THE ODDS OF BEING ABLE

35:50.732 --> 35:53.735
TO GET THINGS BACK

35:53.777 --> 35:56.571
TO THE STATUS QUO

35:53.777 --> 35:56.571
ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL.

35:56.613 --> 35:57.614
DON'T YOU AGREE?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.658
I THOUGHT SO.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.618
ALL RIGHT,

35:59.699 --> 36:01.618
NOW, DON'T WORRY.

36:01.660 --> 36:05.204
I HAVE EVERYTHING

36:01.660 --> 36:05.204
UNDER CONTROL.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.748
OF COURSE YOU DO.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.793
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE FAVORITE.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.211
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.211
I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE IT!

36:12.253 --> 36:13.254
IT'S OKAY.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.547
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

36:14.589 --> 36:16.049
I STARTED LISTENING

36:14.589 --> 36:16.049
TO ROCK MUSIC

36:16.091 --> 36:17.050
WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.468
I STUCK MAKEUP ON AT SCHOOL.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.637
I MANAGED TO JOIN A BAND

36:18.510 --> 36:20.637
WITHOUT ANYONE KNOWING.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.097
I HAD A BOYFRIEND

36:22.139 --> 36:23.849
WHO MY MOTHER THOUGHT

36:22.139 --> 36:23.849
WAS A CHRISTIAN GUITARIST.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.601
AND I ATE SPICY CONDIMENTS LIKE

36:23.890 --> 36:26.601
THEY WERE GOING OUT OF STYLE.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.103
I DRANK SODA, ATE HAMBURGERS.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.479
I WORE JEWELRY.

36:28.145 --> 36:29.479
I DANCED.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.772
NOT VERY WELL.

36:30.814 --> 36:32.273
HEY, ANY SKILL LEVEL'S

36:30.814 --> 36:32.273
A SIN.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.567
AND THEN I MOVED OUT,

36:32.315 --> 36:34.567
AND I LIVE WITH TWO GUYS.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.194
I MEAN, NOTHING ELSE STUCK.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.194
NOTHING.

36:36.235 --> 36:37.236
SO WHY THIS?

36:37.278 --> 36:38.780
IT'S A MYSTERY.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.365
WHY COULDN'T THE GLUTEN-FREE

36:38.822 --> 36:40.365
THING STICK?

36:40.406 --> 36:41.908
I COULD HAVE LIVED WITH THAT.

36:40.406 --> 36:41.908
OR THE NOT DANCING THING.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.994
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ZACH'S

36:41.950 --> 36:43.994
FACE. IT WAS LIKE --

36:44.036 --> 36:45.829
LIKE HE REALIZED HE WASN'T

36:44.036 --> 36:45.829
GONNA HAVE SEX WITH YOU

36:45.871 --> 36:46.872
UNTIL THE WEDDING NIGHT.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.206
YES!

36:46.913 --> 36:48.206
EXACTLY.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.042
GOD, THIS BLOWS!

36:50.083 --> 36:51.584
A LOT OF PEOPLE WAIT UNTIL

36:50.083 --> 36:51.584
THEY'RE MARRIED TO HAVE SEX.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.671
YES! JESSICA SIMPSON AND

36:51.626 --> 36:54.671
DONNA FROM "90210."

36:54.713 --> 36:55.881
AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS.

36:55.922 --> 36:57.382
WHAT IF I NEVER GET MARRIED?

36:57.423 --> 36:58.925
YOU'LL GET MARRIED.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.552
IF I NEVER GET MARRIED,

36:58.967 --> 37:00.552
THEN I'LL NEVER HAVE SEX.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.345
YOU'LL GET MARRIED.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.345
YOU'LL HAVE SEX.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.805
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.515
YOU'VE ALREADY HAD SEX

37:03.847 --> 37:05.515
WITH TWO DIFFERENT GUYS

37:05.557 --> 37:07.059
WITHIN A ONE-YEAR PERIOD.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.601
YOU'RE MAKING ME SOUND

37:07.100 --> 37:08.601
A LITTLE SLUTTY.

37:08.643 --> 37:09.728
WHY SHOULDN'T YOU BE SLUTTY?

37:09.769 --> 37:11.229
YOU HAVE

37:09.769 --> 37:11.229
NO MOTHER-TAUGHT MORAL

37:11.270 --> 37:13.231
STANDING IN THE WAY OF YOU

37:11.270 --> 37:13.231
AND YOUR SLUTTINESS.

37:13.272 --> 37:15.316
OH, WELL, WHEN

37:13.272 --> 37:15.316
YOU PUT IT THAT WAY.

37:15.358 --> 37:17.152
IS IT GREAT?

37:15.358 --> 37:17.152
IS WHAT GREAT?

37:17.194 --> 37:18.486
SEX.

37:17.194 --> 37:18.486
IS IT GREAT?

37:18.528 --> 37:19.988
NOT IN FRONT

37:18.528 --> 37:19.988
OF THE BOOKS, LANE.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.032
WHAT AM I SAYING?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.032
OF COURSE IT'S GREAT!

37:22.074 --> 37:23.575
AND I WILL NEVER EXPERIENCE IT

37:23.616 --> 37:25.368
BECAUSE BY THE TIME

37:23.616 --> 37:25.368
I'M READY TO GET MARRIED,

37:25.410 --> 37:26.995
ALL THE MEN

37:25.410 --> 37:26.995
WILL BE TAKEN BY WOMEN

37:27.037 --> 37:29.081
WHO DIDN'T GROW UP

37:27.037 --> 37:29.081
IN MY HOUSEHOLD.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.540
YOU GOING OUT

37:29.122 --> 37:30.540
TO FIND A HUSBAND?

37:30.582 --> 37:32.542
