WEBVTT

00:17.285 --> 00:19.520
Where are those breakfast bars?

00:19.553 --> 00:22.090
Uh, the kind with sugar,
or the kind without sugar?

00:22.123 --> 00:23.557
I thought neither
of them had sugar.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.794
One kind has sugar, but it's
organic pure cane sugar, so...

00:26.827 --> 00:28.096
Is that even better for you?

00:37.371 --> 00:39.673
So... where are they?
Uh, which kind?

00:39.707 --> 00:41.342
SWAT!
(alarm beeping)

00:41.375 --> 00:42.676
SWAT! Get on the ground now!

00:42.710 --> 00:44.378
Move!
LAPD!
(overlapping shouting)

00:44.412 --> 00:47.415
LAPD! Get down!
MAN:
This is a mistake! Promise.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.616
You have the wrong house!
On the ground!

00:48.649 --> 00:50.551
This is a mistake!

00:50.584 --> 00:52.553
Put your hands together.
Get down!

00:52.586 --> 00:55.223
(whimpering)
Get over here.
On the ground.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.690
Get down and shut up!

00:56.724 --> 00:59.360
Go upstairs and get the stuff.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.596
Go!

01:02.630 --> 01:04.498
(panting)

01:04.532 --> 01:06.734
Why-why are the police
stealing from us?

01:06.767 --> 01:09.103
(whispering):
Because they're not the police.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.809
You-- what's your name?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.645
What's your name?!
Desiree. Desiree.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.847
Desiree, give me
the alarm code,

01:19.880 --> 01:22.483
or we kill your dad.
It-It's six,

01:22.516 --> 01:24.418
seven, one, eight.
Desiree, is that
the right code?

01:24.452 --> 01:26.487
Yes.
Is that the right code?!

01:26.520 --> 01:28.422
Do I need to kill your dad
to show you I'm serious?
No, please.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.823
Please, please don't.
It's the right code!

01:29.857 --> 01:32.293
It's the right code!
(touch tones beeping)

01:32.326 --> 01:34.262
(woman whimpering)

01:34.295 --> 01:35.529
(alarm stops beeping)

01:35.563 --> 01:37.565
Thanks, Desiree.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.632
You did the
right thing.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.137
You know what? You seem
like an interesting girl.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.738
Let's you and I...
No. No.
No, no, no.

01:44.772 --> 01:47.441
...go have a talk, huh?
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:47.475 --> 01:48.842
Get off! No! Just
tell us what you want!

01:48.876 --> 01:50.878
No! Don't take her!
Don't take her!
Please!

01:50.911 --> 01:52.613
Just tell us what you want!

01:52.646 --> 01:54.682
(crying):
Help me! Help me!

01:54.715 --> 01:56.884
MAN:
Please!

02:01.489 --> 02:04.525
(sighs)

02:04.558 --> 02:07.328
Hey, it's probably
just another false alarm.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.398
Uh, sorry to bother you.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.865
We got a noise complaint
about... (grunts)

02:11.899 --> 02:13.534
(groaning)
(gunfire)

02:13.567 --> 02:15.203
(glass breaking)

02:15.236 --> 02:16.570
(groaning)

02:16.604 --> 02:19.640
(engine starts, tires squealing)

02:19.673 --> 02:21.375
(tires squealing)

02:22.843 --> 02:25.145
(engine revving)

02:29.783 --> 02:31.752
House belongs to Donovan
and Trisha Watson.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.454
One child-- 17-year-old girl.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.289
Looks like a home invasion.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.857
Unis got the house surrounded.
The bad guys might

02:36.890 --> 02:38.259
still be inside, or they might
have taken off on foot

02:38.292 --> 02:39.793
after shooting
the security guard.

02:39.827 --> 02:40.894
HONDO:
Either way, we have to assume

02:40.928 --> 02:41.762
they're all still inside.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.364
Be ready for anything.

02:43.397 --> 02:44.765
You awake, Street?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.834
Shoot anything that moves.
Got it.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.305
Be ready for anything.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.569
Metro SWAT!

03:21.602 --> 03:23.003
LAPD!

03:23.036 --> 03:24.638
Metro SWAT!

03:24.672 --> 03:26.807
DEACON:
Kitchen clear.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.479
Go.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.982
Dining room clear.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.950
Luca clear.
Chris out.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.752
Tan out.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.671
No! (groaning)

03:57.705 --> 03:59.840
Leave my family alone!

03:59.873 --> 04:02.242
Street?
(man groaning)

04:04.845 --> 04:07.348
(groans)
I got him.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.285
Police! Put down the weapon!

04:11.319 --> 04:13.821
Put down the weapon now.
How do I know

04:13.854 --> 04:15.789
you're really the police?!
HONDO:
Ma'am, we are the police.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.491
We're Metro SWAT.

04:17.525 --> 04:20.494
Just put down the knife
and step away from the girl.

04:20.528 --> 04:23.297
(woman pants, whimpers)

04:23.331 --> 04:26.066
Mom, it's okay.
It's not them.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.702
(panting)

04:31.772 --> 04:34.408
(woman panting)

04:42.850 --> 04:45.018
*

05:20.421 --> 05:22.055
(indistinct chatter)

05:25.426 --> 05:27.395
They kept yelling
"police" and "SWAT."

05:27.428 --> 05:29.830
Why wouldn't
we believe them?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.799
HONDO:
We're working with Robbery-
Homicide to track 'em down.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.934
Now, any details, no matter how
small, can help us find them.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.537
Well, I don't know what to tell
you, except that they were...

05:36.570 --> 05:38.639
they were dressed like you guys,
except their faces were covered.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.940
DEACON:
Well, what about race?

05:39.973 --> 05:41.809
Or height or accents?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.944
Um, you know,
it was all a blur, really.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.613
Maybe your daughter
got a better look?

05:45.646 --> 05:48.416
No, she saw even less
than we did.

05:52.786 --> 05:55.823
You said you were zip-tied?

05:55.856 --> 05:58.091
Yes. You saw them.
They were right over there.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.528
But then they cut you free?
Um...

06:00.561 --> 06:02.596
Desiree set us free.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.532
So they cut her loose?

06:04.565 --> 06:06.033
She slipped out of them.
She's small.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.670
She slipped out of them?
But they were cut.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.139
Then she must have cut them.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.874
And why were her zip ties
in another room?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.810
Okay, this was all
very terrifying.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.079
How much longer
will the officers be here?

06:22.816 --> 06:24.752
A few hours, ma'am.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.890
Wait.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.427
You're staying,
right?

06:33.461 --> 06:36.196
Uh...

06:36.229 --> 06:37.965
EMTs are getting packed
up if any of you want

06:37.998 --> 06:39.533
to change your mind
about getting checked out.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.734
No. We're fine.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.978
(garbled radio transmission)

06:51.011 --> 06:53.013
HONDO:
Something happened in there.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.148
They don't want us
to know about it.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.717
You thinking
sexual assault?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.519
I really hope not.
Sure feels that way.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.920
In which case
she needs

06:59.953 --> 07:01.522
to be convinced to get
medical attention.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.223
Get a counselor
up here?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.058
When that girl saw Chris,
she knew we were the good guys.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.194
Hey, there's already
a connection there.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.029
I'll talk to her.

07:09.062 --> 07:12.065
High-end jewelry like that's
gonna be tough to unload.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.101
You sound like
you have an idea.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.036
I got some buddies who buy
this kind of merchandise.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.505
You're buddies
with jewelry fencers?

07:17.538 --> 07:19.206
Not exactly fencers.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.041
Let's just say they
work in the gray area.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.677
All right, the less I know,
the better. Go.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.513
Don't make me
regret it.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.214
(garbled radio transmission)

07:27.247 --> 07:29.717
What if he had come at us with
a gun instead of a golf club?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.151
I was thinking the same thing.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.487
The last thing we need is
citizens taking shots at us

07:33.521 --> 07:36.089
because they think
we're the bad guys.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.224
Somebody's gonna get killed.
DEACON:
We should check with

07:37.257 --> 07:39.059
the SWAT uniform vendors.
There's only a couple in L.A.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.862
How are the victims?

07:41.895 --> 07:44.698
It's hard to say.
They're lying to us.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.600
Like they don't want us
to catch whoever did this.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.669
Insurance scam?
HONDO:
Donovan and Trisha Watson.

07:48.702 --> 07:51.071
They both have
their own businesses.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.707
Maybe one of them got caught up
with the wrong kind of people.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.143
We'll look into their
financial situation.
Chief wants to be updated

07:56.176 --> 07:57.745
on this one, so when you know
something, let me know

07:57.778 --> 07:59.780
so I can tell him.
I'll check

07:59.813 --> 08:02.215
with Robbery-Homicide.
They inside?
Mm-hmm.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.517
(garbled radio transmission)

08:03.551 --> 08:05.052
Big boss getting
his hands dirty?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.187
(scoffs)
Look around, Deac.
It's Brentwood.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.590
You two have that
protection detail today.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.824
Yeah, I was hoping
we could, uh, stay on this.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.926
You know,
maybe one of Mumford's guys

08:12.960 --> 08:14.928
could take it.
Yeah, I second that.

08:14.962 --> 08:15.596
They've got
Homeland Security drills

08:15.629 --> 08:16.463
through the end of the week.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.799
I'm sorry, guys.
This comes from the top.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.735
We'll make do.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.972
TAN:
Hey, Hondo.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.139
Lady here runs
a private security firm

08:26.173 --> 08:27.975
that patrols the neighborhood.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.077
They notice anything
out of the ordinary recently?

08:30.110 --> 08:31.979
Nothing big,
but she said there's a couple

08:32.012 --> 08:33.681
in the neighborhood--
Jake and Tiffany Kemp--

08:33.714 --> 08:35.883
asked her just last week
if she offers a premium service.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.185
24/7 security
against home invasions.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.590
You get the Kemps' address?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.558
MAN:
I read an article.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.293
Said these kinds
of things were on the rise,

08:46.326 --> 08:49.062
so I looked into upgrading
our security. That's all.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.631
Oh, just in time, huh?

08:50.664 --> 08:52.232
They said they
don't offer

08:52.265 --> 08:55.035
the services I asked for,
but I found someone who did.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.937
We noticed.
HONDO: Two armed men
outside of your house 24/7.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.840
It's a little overkill,
don't you think?

08:59.873 --> 09:03.310
Apparently not, given what you
say happened down the street.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.145
You hire protection
for home invasions, and then,

09:05.178 --> 09:06.880
a week later, you have a home
invasion in your neighborhood.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.182
Something must
have spooked you.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.985
Suspicious people driving by,
a threat of some kind?

09:13.721 --> 09:15.823
Like I said, I read an article.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.658
An article.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.728
Right, yeah.
I wish I could help,
but I'm late for work.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.196
Did something happen
to your door back there?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.998
We're doing some remodeling.
These people seem
to have a thing

09:25.032 --> 09:26.634
for high-end jewelry.
Would you happen

09:26.667 --> 09:28.101
to have something like
that in your home?

09:28.135 --> 09:30.904
Nothing worth taking.
Hey, look, I-I...

09:30.938 --> 09:32.272
I know you guys are just
doing your job,

09:32.305 --> 09:34.875
and I don't want this
to come off as rude,

09:34.908 --> 09:37.044
but all I did
was read an article and hire

09:37.077 --> 09:41.148
security to help my family.
That's not a crime.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.217
The same thing happened
here as at the other house.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.886
Doesn't make sense.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.221
Somebody kicks in the door
and ties up my family,

09:48.255 --> 09:50.323
I'm begging the police
to look into it.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.993
The Kemps' daughter looked about
the same age as Desiree Watson.

09:53.026 --> 09:56.329
They might know each other,
even if the parents don't.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.766
Chris, I got
something for you.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.934
Okay. Yeah.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.737
Got it.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.677
They find them?
Not yet.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.078
Do you know the Kemps?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.345
They live a few streets over
on Langham.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.047
No.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.283
They get robbed, too?

10:16.316 --> 10:17.785
We're not sure yet.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.319
They have a daughter.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.889
Laura, your age.

10:21.922 --> 10:22.956
Do you know her?

10:26.393 --> 10:28.361
No.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.330
What?

10:31.899 --> 10:35.803
It's... nothing.
It's just...

10:35.836 --> 10:39.973
um... this kind of thing
shouldn't happen to anyone.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.777
No. It shouldn't.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.817
(sighs)

10:51.184 --> 10:54.187
(indistinct shouts)

10:55.255 --> 10:56.289
(whistle blows)

10:56.323 --> 10:58.358
MAN:
Whoa! Way to go, way to go!

10:58.391 --> 11:00.393
(indistinct shouts)

11:03.764 --> 11:05.799
So, which one's our guy?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.801
You don't know
who Bobby Strock is?

11:07.835 --> 11:09.369
You don't follow hockey?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.039
No, I never got into it.
"Never got into it"?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.007
How have we never had
this conversation?

11:14.041 --> 11:16.209
Look, I know it's your thing,
but I don't want people

11:16.243 --> 11:18.912
trying to force me to like
stuff I'm not interested in.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.949
DEACON: But you get why people
want to kill this guy, right?

11:21.982 --> 11:23.050
Yeah, he injured one of
our players last month.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.318
You might have mentioned it
once or twice.
Yeah.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.187
Justin Montgomery.
Justin Montgomery--

11:27.220 --> 11:29.022
he knocked him out for
the season, on a dirty hit.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.191
It could cost us the playoffs.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.494
BRIAN:
Officers Kay and Luca?

11:34.527 --> 11:37.064
Yes.
Hey. Brian Mobley.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.498
Bobby's agent.
Good to meet you.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.100
Thank you so much
for helping us out.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.802
Well, V.I.P. protection's

11:41.835 --> 11:43.336
one of our main
responsibilities.
We saw

11:43.370 --> 11:45.906
the letters he's receiving,
I mean, memes online

11:45.939 --> 11:48.075
burning him in effigy.
Imagine that.

11:48.108 --> 11:51.211
Oh, let me guess--
hometown fan?
No,

11:51.244 --> 11:52.412
I'm just a fan of clean hockey.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.314
Hey, maybe it was an accident.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.083
Full-speed, blindside elbow
to the head? You watch it

11:56.116 --> 11:57.084
in slow motion
and tell me that's an accident.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.952
Well, it's
a rough game--

11:58.986 --> 12:00.720
injuries happen sometimes.
Hey, Bobby.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.157
LAPD SWAT-- awesome!

12:04.191 --> 12:05.425
Luca.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.994
Hey, guys.
Deacon.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.096
Sergeant.
What are you, 20-David?

12:09.129 --> 12:10.831
Uh, 30-David, actually.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.099
Dude,
it's an honor.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.101
You must have
some massive stories.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.803
You seem to know
a thing or two about SWAT.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.170
Oh, yeah. If I'd
have known I'd get

12:17.204 --> 12:19.072
to hang out with you
guys, I would've tried

12:19.106 --> 12:20.307
making enemies
a long time ago.

12:20.340 --> 12:21.942
These are
serious threats, Bobby.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.111
From a bunch of serious losers.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.513
Can't wait to hear
some badass takedown stories.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.783
My cell's on here.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.052
Call me if you need me.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.420
Off the record...

12:33.453 --> 12:35.322
he's a little off.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.757
Even for a hockey player.

12:39.592 --> 12:43.230
*

12:43.263 --> 12:46.266
JESSICA:
I promise you, Ms. Webb,

12:46.299 --> 12:48.401
we are leaving no
stone unturned.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.937
That's why
I brought you here, Lacy.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.905
SWAT is LAPD's
best and brightest,

12:51.939 --> 12:53.807
and they're
all over this.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.242
And we always
welcome a visit

12:55.275 --> 12:57.177
from a member
of the city council.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.079
Then, SWAT should be the ones
protecting the neighborhood.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.581
LAPD already has metro
crime suppression platoons

13:01.614 --> 13:03.483
assigned to your area.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.886
If SWAT is the best,
I want SWAT officers

13:05.919 --> 13:07.454
doing the patrols,

13:07.487 --> 13:09.422
every day until we
find these people.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.024
LAPD's already using

13:11.058 --> 13:12.826
more resources
on today's home invasion

13:12.860 --> 13:14.194
than on a double murder

13:14.227 --> 13:16.864
last night
in South L.A.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.832
Having money doesn't
buy you special treatment

13:18.866 --> 13:20.500
from the police--
not from SWAT.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.836
Well, I'm sure that's
not what Lacy...
I'm not looking

13:22.870 --> 13:24.872
for special treatment,
Captain Cortez.

13:24.905 --> 13:27.007
I'm looking
for the exact treatment

13:27.040 --> 13:29.042
that you should be
providing everywhere.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.344
It's not my fault if you're
providing substandard treatment

13:31.378 --> 13:33.480
to South L.A.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.183
But that doesn't mean we have to
accept it in our neighborhood.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.550
Treat everybody better.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.922
Well, we've made our request.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.857
Now let's let Jessica
get back to work,

13:43.891 --> 13:45.292
and I'll follow
up later.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.960
Thank you.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.062
*

13:51.498 --> 13:53.533
(sighs)

13:53.566 --> 13:55.903
HONDO:
You sold the guy

13:55.936 --> 13:57.404
four of these SWAT outfits?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.306
Guy bought four complete sets--
boots, helmets,

13:59.339 --> 14:01.208
uh, the whole kit and caboodle.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.210
Look a lot like
the real thing.
We pride ourselves

14:03.243 --> 14:06.379
on the authenticity of our
police and military uniforms.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.614
HONDO: And of course,
you check customer I.D.s,

14:07.647 --> 14:09.416
keep all the necessary records.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.953
(chuckles):
Well, I mean, things move fast.
If someone wants

14:12.986 --> 14:14.487
to buy a police uniform,
they'd have

14:14.521 --> 14:17.124
to show you a letter from
the department saying it's okay.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.092
If they have a department
insignia on the uniforms, yeah,

14:19.126 --> 14:21.261
but these don't say "LAPD,"
they just say "police."

14:21.294 --> 14:22.262
Well, congratulations
on following

14:22.295 --> 14:25.132
the absolute minimum
letter of the law, Felix.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.600
We make every effort to ensure
our customers need the uniforms

14:27.634 --> 14:29.436
for legitimate purposes.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.171
The guy you sold these to

14:31.204 --> 14:33.106
used them to terrorize
people in their homes.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.942
I don't want to hear about
your "every effort."

14:34.975 --> 14:36.476
(phone chimes)
Right now I want
to hear every detail

14:36.509 --> 14:38.211
you remember about the
guy who bought 'em.

14:38.245 --> 14:41.381
He said he was making
a Web series.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.416
I-It's L.A.
Everyone's doing that.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.517
Can you at least describe him?

14:44.551 --> 14:46.987
Uh, he looked, uh...

14:47.020 --> 14:50.157
like the type of guy
who makes a Web series.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.292
One of my fences has some guys
in his store right now

14:52.325 --> 14:53.693
trying to get
some high-end stuff appraised.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.028
On the west side?
Mm-hmm.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.429
Let's go.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.297
STREET:
Said he's gonna stall 'em.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.299
How?
Didn't say.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.034
G-Good luck.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.405
*

15:05.438 --> 15:07.274
You guys
can't leave!

15:07.307 --> 15:09.109
STREET: That's my guy,
the one with the shotgun.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.412
(tires screeching)

15:17.317 --> 15:19.586
(siren wailing)

15:27.060 --> 15:28.461
(siren chirping)

15:35.335 --> 15:36.603
(tires screech, siren whoops)

15:36.636 --> 15:38.571
Street, take care of your boy!

15:38.605 --> 15:39.539
Will, Will, Will!

15:39.572 --> 15:41.074
Put the gun down!

15:41.108 --> 15:43.943
*

15:48.281 --> 15:49.716
Tan!

15:51.684 --> 15:53.153
(grunts)

16:06.033 --> 16:08.535
This is 20-David
in pursuit of suspect.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.637
Westbound in east/west alley

16:10.670 --> 16:13.006
off Santa Monica and Kelton.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.376
Three other suspects headed
east and north through same.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.078
We need an airship.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.113
Hey!

16:25.418 --> 16:26.186
Gun!

16:37.597 --> 16:38.631
Come on!

16:38.665 --> 16:39.499
(vehicle approaching)

16:43.836 --> 16:45.472
(grunts)

16:45.505 --> 16:47.507
TAN:
Go. Hands on.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.608
Go. Go.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.584
Looks like the stuff stolen
from the Watsons this morning.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.152
TAN:
Airship's late responding.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.487
Nobody's got eyes
on the other suspects.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.721
Well, at least
we got one of them.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.264
You gave it a good shot, though!

17:11.298 --> 17:13.800
You're lucky it was them
that got you instead of me!

17:16.269 --> 17:17.604
Guys think 'cause
I don't wear a suit that

17:17.637 --> 17:19.306
I'm some kind of fence--
I'm just new kind of legit.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.407
Hey, chill out. Bring it down.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.742
This new kind of legit

17:22.775 --> 17:25.245
involve functioning
security cameras?
Yeah, sure,

17:25.278 --> 17:27.614
but I outsource, you know, so
the footage goes on the cloud.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.549
I mean, I could get it
in an hour, probably.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.219
You said these four
have been here before?
Last week.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.421
I bought some nice pieces
off them, real nice.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.189
Nothing on any theft reports--
I checked.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.424
Because you're not a fence.
Exactly.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.859
They said they'd be back
with more, too.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.262
When?
Just before I pulled out
the shot...

17:42.295 --> 17:43.830
No, no, when did they say
they'd have more jewelry?

17:43.863 --> 17:47.100
Tomorrow. They said they'd be
back tomorrow with more rocks.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.502
Sounds like they have
another home invasion planned.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.838
Think they'd be dumb enough
to do it again so soon?
They might be

17:51.871 --> 17:54.174
desperate enough-- we just
scooped up their profits
from this morning.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.643
That jewelry you bought off them
last week, I'm gonna need that.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.379
All of it?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.415
Can I get a receipt?

18:12.592 --> 18:14.294
You know, um...

18:14.327 --> 18:16.896
I've been doing this a while.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.331
The cop thing.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.136
And you start getting
pretty good at figuring out

18:23.170 --> 18:26.406
when someone's not
telling you the whole story.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.376
I'm not lying to
you, I promise.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.582
When I was 15...

18:37.484 --> 18:40.187
...some guys grabbed me
while I was going

18:40.220 --> 18:42.722
to the gas station
to get cheese puffs.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.558
(chuckles)
And I love cheese puffs.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.430
They, uh...

18:50.463 --> 18:52.199
they were
the East Valley Pasas,

18:52.232 --> 18:54.201
and they thought
I was this other girl

18:54.234 --> 18:57.504
who was dating the head
of the Sirois Street Mafia.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.472
They had me tied up
for hours...

19:01.574 --> 19:04.611
...before they figured out
I wasn't her.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.680
Hours...

19:07.714 --> 19:09.816
under their control.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.820
And, uh...

19:13.853 --> 19:17.724
I was... really scared
for a long time after that.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.528
Scared to go
to the store.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.863
Scared about everything.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.801
And I was really mad at myself
for not getting over it.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.438
I just kept saying it.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.839
I just kept saying it
in my head,

19:32.872 --> 19:35.542
"Just-just-just get
over it," and I...

19:35.575 --> 19:37.277
How did you?
(sighs)

19:37.310 --> 19:38.945
I didn't.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.981
But that's when I figured out
I didn't have to get over it

19:42.014 --> 19:45.352
if I could just look it in the
face and-and then control it,

19:45.385 --> 19:47.354
instead of letting it
control me.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.429
Desiree...

19:56.463 --> 19:58.298
those men this morning...

19:59.899 --> 20:02.902
...did they hurt you?

20:02.935 --> 20:04.771
Did they touch you?

20:04.804 --> 20:06.539
Rape me?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.276
No.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.579
They didn't.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.414
I swear.

20:19.519 --> 20:23.656
* Don't call me all the time,
it's no way to behave *

20:23.690 --> 20:26.326
* If you're not gonna call me
by my name *

20:26.359 --> 20:28.027
* I can't say that you're mine

20:28.060 --> 20:29.696
* But I've got so much to say

20:29.729 --> 20:31.531
(knocking)

20:31.564 --> 20:32.965
* You're stubborn

20:32.999 --> 20:35.968
* Concentrate, I'm trying

20:36.002 --> 20:37.604
* I should have stayed away

20:37.637 --> 20:39.339
(knocking)

20:39.372 --> 20:40.340
* Call me by my name

20:40.373 --> 20:42.241
* My name...

20:43.643 --> 20:45.445
What took you so long?

20:46.879 --> 20:49.382
What are you doing?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.884
Packing up?
We got another job.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.019
You crazy, bro?

20:53.052 --> 20:54.854
They got T.C.
So we do it
without him.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.556
The last two went perfect!

20:56.589 --> 20:58.325
This isn't a can't-miss thing
anymore-- you get that?

20:58.358 --> 20:59.926
One more job. Okay?

20:59.959 --> 21:02.295
We're talking at least
a hundred grand.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.597
Buys enough product to expand
into three different clubs.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.699
Gordon, you're better
than T.C. anyway.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.601
You can take his spot,
and I'll do my...

21:08.635 --> 21:09.936
Stop smoking your supply!

21:09.969 --> 21:12.004
This isn't about expanding
the business anymore.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.741
This is about our pictures
all over the news

21:14.774 --> 21:17.009
from that jewelry guy's camera.
We got to run, man.

21:17.043 --> 21:20.413
So let's at least get
some more money to run with.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.382
Nah, bro. I'm out.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.816
Me, too.

21:23.850 --> 21:24.951
* Why we don't do it
like we... *

21:24.984 --> 21:27.554
We're doing this next job!

21:27.587 --> 21:29.456
Together!

21:35.127 --> 21:38.097
* But if you're not
gonna call me by my name *

21:38.130 --> 21:40.066
* Don't call me all the time

21:40.099 --> 21:41.834
* It's no way to behave...

21:41.868 --> 21:43.470
(indistinct shouts)

21:46.806 --> 21:48.541
(whistle blows)
COACH:
Okay, good practice, boys.

21:52.945 --> 21:56.483
Let me put in my teeth and we
can grab some brews, talk SWAT.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.117
Uh, no, the
itinerary we have

21:58.150 --> 22:00.052
is that we're taking
you back to the hotel.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.489
Plans change.
It's not like I'm a prisoner.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.057
And with you guys watching my
back, I'm safe anywhere, right?

22:05.091 --> 22:07.126
All right, let's see what
your agent has to say.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.562
Come on, guys. Grab one beer.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.898
I know a kick-ass bar near here.
Call.

22:11.931 --> 22:12.899
All right.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.506
Be right back.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.684
(door shuts)

22:33.185 --> 22:34.921
You heard him.
He wants a lawyer.

22:34.954 --> 22:35.888
We know if he had
any connection

22:35.922 --> 22:37.457
to the victims?

22:37.490 --> 22:39.759
Watson family's never heard
of any T.C. Fleming.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.628
Leads on the three friends?

22:41.661 --> 22:43.062
T.C.'s been busted
a couple times for possession.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.464
No known associates.

22:44.497 --> 22:46.098
We got security
footage

22:46.132 --> 22:47.534
on the other guys
coming any minute.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.568
We're gonna run that
by the families.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.036
"Families"? Plural?

22:50.069 --> 22:51.103
Yeah.
Didn't the Kemps

22:51.137 --> 22:52.805
ask you to leave 'em alone?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.574
These punks are doing crimes
dressed as SWAT.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.543
Every second they're out there
is another second

22:56.576 --> 22:58.077
the public second-guesses
this uniform.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.413
We go where the case takes us.
Well, of course.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.615
I mean,
we want these guys found.

23:02.649 --> 23:04.851
But, you know,
just handle with care.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.920
Just like it says on the label.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.559
I heard
you pulled a copy

23:12.592 --> 23:14.126
of the department's budget
earlier today.

23:14.160 --> 23:16.663
Is that because of that woman
that Councilwoman Baliss

23:16.696 --> 23:18.064
brought in?
I thought she
was gonna push

23:18.097 --> 23:20.500
for special favors,
but she surprised me.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.168
Yeah.
Actually made me think.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.570
Regarding what?
Whether I'm part

23:23.603 --> 23:25.605
of the problem
or the solution.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.207
We've gotten so used to the way
things are that we forget to ask

23:28.240 --> 23:30.477
if they have
to be that way.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.711
She's right.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.913
We should do better.
By everyone.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.215
Well, everyone I see here
is busting their butts.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.985
We've got a team in Brentwood
and two officers protecting

23:39.018 --> 23:40.987
a hockey player
while two murders

23:41.020 --> 23:42.989
in South L.A. are
still unsolved.

23:43.022 --> 23:44.524
You know, when I first started,

23:44.557 --> 23:45.725
I was gonna change
the world, too, Jessica,

23:45.758 --> 23:47.226
but these situations,

23:47.259 --> 23:49.762
they're like political
hot potatoes.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.764
Just throw this woman a bone,

23:51.798 --> 23:55.201
get this councilwoman
off our backs.

23:57.804 --> 23:59.205
CHRIS:
We caught one of them,

23:59.238 --> 24:01.140
which means we're closing in.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.575
We're gonna catch
the other three.

24:02.609 --> 24:03.576
What then?

24:03.610 --> 24:05.144
Then it's over.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.490
You're still scared.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.925
Why?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.260
The guy you caught,

24:21.293 --> 24:24.864
if he had anything on him
when you arrested him,

24:24.897 --> 24:26.899
what happens to it?

24:26.933 --> 24:28.535
You mean the jewelry?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.770
No, I-I mean, like...

24:30.803 --> 24:32.238
like his phone.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.273
What happens
to that kind of stuff?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.909
Oh, anything that he had on him
at the time of his arrest

24:36.943 --> 24:38.911
is in police custody now.
So, you don't give it

24:38.945 --> 24:41.080
to anyone? Not
his lawyer? No one?

24:42.615 --> 24:45.852
Desiree, what...
what's in his phone?

24:47.119 --> 24:49.255
Whatever it is,

24:49.288 --> 24:51.758
you're strong enough to face it.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.968
After they tied up my parents,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.537
two of them took me upstairs...

25:06.806 --> 25:10.877
...and they started videoing me
on their phones.

25:14.146 --> 25:17.650
They made me take off
my clothes.

25:17.684 --> 25:20.920
And...

25:20.953 --> 25:23.923
they told me
that they would kill my parents

25:23.956 --> 25:26.659
if...
(shuddering breath)

25:26.693 --> 25:29.996
if I didn't talk on camera
about...

25:30.029 --> 25:33.232
the dirtiest thing
I'd ever done.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.868
(sighs)

25:35.902 --> 25:39.271
Or the dirtiest thing
I'd ever thought about doing.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.644
(crying):
So I did.

25:44.677 --> 25:47.980
And then they
said that...

25:50.249 --> 25:52.885
...if we did anything
to help the police,

25:52.919 --> 25:54.821
that they would put it online,

25:54.854 --> 25:58.024
so if anyone...

25:58.057 --> 26:00.026
Googled my name,

26:00.059 --> 26:04.764
like colleges or employers...

26:06.232 --> 26:10.236
...it'll follow me forever.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.140
(sighs)

26:17.744 --> 26:19.946
(sighs)

26:23.049 --> 26:26.018
(crying)

26:26.052 --> 26:27.654
(sniffles)

26:27.687 --> 26:29.155
(quietly):
Hey.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.591
(sniffling)

26:37.797 --> 26:41.333
The "Jake and Tiffany
Tenth Anniversary" inscription

26:41.367 --> 26:42.869
makes me think
this all might be yours.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.808
You want
to get real with me?

26:48.841 --> 26:51.377
The other family that
got robbed, the robbers made

26:51.410 --> 26:53.379
a video
of their daughter.

26:55.147 --> 26:57.984
I just want to
protect my girl.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.753
The best way for you to do that
is help us catch these guys

27:00.787 --> 27:03.690
so they don't do anything
with that video.

27:03.723 --> 27:07.026
Or do what they did to
your daughter to somebody else.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.664
I'll help you.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.401
I won't let it happen
to anyone else.

27:22.775 --> 27:25.945
I didn't know his name,
but I've seen him at Hardline.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.947
Hardline?
It's this little club

27:27.980 --> 27:29.281
near UCLA.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.684
They don't look very hard
at your I.D.

27:31.718 --> 27:34.353
Do you recognize
any of these guys?

27:35.988 --> 27:36.889
Um...

27:38.791 --> 27:39.926
Wait, that's...

27:39.959 --> 27:41.193
Cash.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.361
Cash is his name?

27:42.394 --> 27:43.730
He deals Molly at Hardline.

27:43.763 --> 27:44.697
LAURA:
Cash is bad news.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.166
I try to stay away from him.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.835
HONDO: Sounds like Cash
and T.C. were scoping out

27:48.868 --> 27:50.402
rich girls at this club.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.772
Which means the next target
could be somebody

27:52.805 --> 27:54.306
that you partied with
at Hardline.

27:54.340 --> 27:58.210
Is there anybody Cash and T.C.
paid special attention to?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.947
The only girl I know who's there
every weekend is April Bagley.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.248
Is she a friend of yours?

28:02.281 --> 28:04.717
We go to school together.

28:04.751 --> 28:07.286
Cash definitely has
a thing for her.
HONDO: April Bagley.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.356
Does she live around here?
I think so.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.059
I-I met her at a party.
I've never been to her house.
It's okay.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.061
We'll find it.
Before Cash does.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.097
Thank you.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.933
I know you've
been through a lot.

28:20.967 --> 28:23.102
(cheering and applause)

28:29.308 --> 28:30.943
Whoa.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.779
Is that Bobby Strock?

28:32.812 --> 28:34.881
(indistinct chatter)

28:36.015 --> 28:37.216
Seriously?

28:37.249 --> 28:38.384
What is this, man?

28:38.417 --> 28:39.518
Skate-around was tough today.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.120
Made me thirsty.

28:41.153 --> 28:44.256
This really isn't getting me
into hockey.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.292
(booing)

28:46.325 --> 28:49.061
MAN: You suck, Bobby!
MAN 2: Get out of here!

28:49.095 --> 28:51.397
MAN 3: Get out
of here, Bobby!

28:51.430 --> 28:52.832
(shouting continues)

28:52.865 --> 28:55.835
Whatever beer you have on tap,
barkeep.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.370
Get lost!
We don't want you here!

28:58.404 --> 29:01.273
Call yourself a player? You look
like a damn giraffe on skates.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.242
And a couple ginger beers
for my friends.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.144
WOMAN:
Get out of here...

29:05.177 --> 29:08.114
MAN 4: You suck!
MAN 5: Suck it, buddy!

29:08.147 --> 29:10.549
Weak-sauce fans
for a weak-sauce team.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.551
You got our city
on your uniform,

29:12.584 --> 29:14.954
you're protecting this
jackass?! Pick a side!

29:14.987 --> 29:16.522
Yeah, pick a side.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.891
(shouting continues)

29:20.860 --> 29:23.295
I might kill him myself.

29:23.329 --> 29:26.232
Look, I know Cash
and T.C.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.934
Okay, they wouldn't
hurt me.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.936
They hurt your
friends pretty bad.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.004
Yeah, but if they wanted
to rob from me,

29:32.038 --> 29:33.505
they could have at any time.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.074
Wait, they've been
to your house before?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.409
A few of my parties, yeah.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.011
Where are your parents?

29:39.045 --> 29:40.579
Oh, my mom, uh, is

29:40.612 --> 29:42.114
in Ibiza this month
with her boyfriend.

29:42.148 --> 29:44.116
And my dad lives in New York
with his boyfriend.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.952
So you're here alone?

29:45.985 --> 29:47.887
Yeah, but, listen, okay,

29:47.920 --> 29:49.521
Cash isn't gonna come after me,

29:49.555 --> 29:51.157
uh, and I'm hanging
with some girls tonight.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.926
So maybe you guys want to stay
and watch the place

29:53.960 --> 29:55.928
and I can go stay at a friend's?

29:55.962 --> 29:58.965
You're gonna have to cancel
your plans, April.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.967
CROWD:
Dirty!

30:01.000 --> 30:03.269
Dirty! Dirty! Dirty!

30:03.302 --> 30:05.304
Dirty! Dirty!

30:05.337 --> 30:06.372
Dirty!
Time to go.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.174
Come on.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.242
I didn't even get
any SWAT stories yet.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.979
It's not really a conducive, uh,
environment for storytelling.

30:13.012 --> 30:15.414
Ha. Hey, these fans
could use a good story

30:15.447 --> 30:17.216
after my team breaks
their hearts tomorrow night.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.517
In your dreams!

30:18.550 --> 30:20.019
Bunch of donkey

30:20.052 --> 30:21.020
fair-weather fans.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.588
Say that again, scumbag!

30:22.621 --> 30:23.990
(jeering)

30:26.358 --> 30:28.127
(shouts)
That's far enough.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.461
I said stay back.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.463
(grunting)

30:31.497 --> 30:32.464
Get off of him!

30:32.498 --> 30:34.000
Patrick, you okay?!

30:34.033 --> 30:35.968
Down, down. Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
(shouts)

30:36.002 --> 30:38.270
(laughing)

30:38.304 --> 30:39.638
MAN:
Got no right!

30:39.671 --> 30:41.974
WOMAN:
Get your hands off him!

30:42.008 --> 30:43.575
Get off of him!

30:43.609 --> 30:45.444
(keys clacking)

30:45.477 --> 30:47.980
You guys ever been to Rhyner's
on Sunset?

30:48.014 --> 30:50.382
It has this salad with,
like, pears in it. So epic.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.453
Not much of a foodie, I guess.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.422
Mm. You're like Virgil,
my mom's last boyfriend.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.257
He was from Texas.
All he ate

30:58.290 --> 30:59.591
was, like, steak.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.127
Probably on his third
heart attack by now.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.128
HONDO:
Back of the house

31:02.161 --> 31:03.996
is locked down. Once
the other units get here,

31:04.030 --> 31:05.531
we'll have eyes on
the whole perimeter.

31:05.564 --> 31:09.068
Okay. Well, all this food talk
has me starving.

31:09.101 --> 31:10.102
So do you guys

31:10.136 --> 31:11.070
want anything
from the kitchen?

31:11.103 --> 31:11.904
Think we're good.

31:19.278 --> 31:20.980
(garage door opening)

31:21.013 --> 31:22.348
(starts engine)

31:26.385 --> 31:28.187
(garage door stops)

31:28.220 --> 31:30.923
(garage door closing)

31:30.957 --> 31:32.925
Don't need your purse to
get food out of the kitchen.

31:32.959 --> 31:33.926
Where you going?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.627
Oh, I...

31:35.661 --> 31:36.963
I thought
I left my phone charger in here.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.330
I guess... I guess not.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.070
85%. You want to
try another lie?

31:44.103 --> 31:46.172
If I check
this phone,

31:46.205 --> 31:48.440
am I gonna find the videos
Cash made of Desiree and Laura?

31:50.442 --> 31:52.078
What the hell did you do, April?

31:55.481 --> 31:57.216
(siren wailing in distance)

31:59.385 --> 32:01.553
So, Cash sent me some videos.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.622
I mean, it doesn't mean
that I knew about any of this

32:03.655 --> 32:06.225
ahead of time.
HONDO: "Some videos"?

32:06.258 --> 32:08.995
April, these were movies of
your friends being humiliated,

32:09.028 --> 32:11.197
naked, at gunpoint.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.432
If you weren't a part of it,
why didn't you call the police

32:13.465 --> 32:15.034
when you saw them?
I thought it was

32:15.067 --> 32:16.368
maybe a prank.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.370
Laura's such an attention whore.
I didn't know.

32:18.404 --> 32:21.307
You don't get
how these girls suffered?

32:21.340 --> 32:22.574
How they suffered?

32:24.410 --> 32:27.113
I mean, I don't remember
anybody crying for me

32:27.146 --> 32:29.315
when a picture that my
best friend Desiree took

32:29.348 --> 32:31.717
showed up on the slut board
in the guys' locker room.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.552
Then she tries to tell me
it wasn't her fault.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.256
Bitch, please.

32:37.289 --> 32:40.292
And if Laura doesn't know
what she did...

32:40.326 --> 32:42.128
then she deserves everything

32:42.161 --> 32:44.130
that Cash made her do
in that video, and more.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.397
You planned these
home invasions, had Cash

32:45.431 --> 32:47.333
make those videos,
over a grudge?

32:47.366 --> 32:50.002
I didn't plan anything.
We're pretty sure
another one

32:50.036 --> 32:51.603
is about to go down.
Now, if you tell us where,

32:51.637 --> 32:53.105
maybe we can get you a deal.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.141
Deal for what?

32:56.742 --> 32:59.211
I didn't do anything.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.782
Did you get ahold of my mom yet?

33:03.815 --> 33:06.185
She's gonna take care
of all this.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.160
I had no clue she was
still mad about that.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.695
It wasn't my fault--
lots of kids had that picture.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.730
None of this
is your fault, Desiree.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.233
This girl
is a total psycho.

33:21.267 --> 33:23.402
It's like she's not
living on the same planet

33:23.435 --> 33:25.671
as the rest of us.
Same planet,
different tax bracket.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.707
Probably never had to deal with
the consequences of her actions.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.209
All right, girls,
you heard April.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.810
I'm gonna need
your help again.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.312
Who else might
be on her hit list?

33:33.345 --> 33:35.414
Laura, what about that thing

33:35.447 --> 33:37.216
she just said about you-- that
you'd know what you did wrong?

33:37.249 --> 33:40.119
I don't know. I seriously
thought we were cool.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.688
Are you the same Laura
that Corby was flirting with?

33:42.721 --> 33:45.357
That was months ago.
It seems like April has

33:45.391 --> 33:46.392
a long memory.
Who's Corby?
Corby Davidson,

33:46.425 --> 33:48.394
April's ex.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.330
He hit on me at a party once
when they were still dating.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.299
Nothing happened, though.
But he broke up with her

33:53.332 --> 33:55.401
the next day.
She still bitches about it.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.337
Sounds like Corby could be next.
And April saved him for last.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.805
Who knows what she's got
planned for him. Do you have

33:59.838 --> 34:00.672
Corby's number?
Yeah.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.777
All right, Chris,
you take home, I got cell.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.347
(dialing)

34:08.380 --> 34:09.415
It's going
straight to voice mail.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.783
Busy signal at the house.
Phone's off the hook.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.123
*

34:24.863 --> 34:27.099
*

34:28.600 --> 34:29.868
I can't find it.
You what?

34:29.901 --> 34:31.203
I looked right where you said.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.139
I'll do it.
You watch 'em.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.373
(helicopter blades whirring,
sirens wailing in distance)

34:36.475 --> 34:38.844
Oh, no.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.646
Oh, no.
(growls)

34:44.783 --> 34:46.152
(gunshots)

34:47.886 --> 34:49.555
(panting)
What do we do?

34:53.159 --> 34:55.461
(indistinct conversations)

35:00.466 --> 35:03.169
You guys are gonna teach me
those takedown moves, right?

35:03.202 --> 35:06.172
I could use those on the ice.
You do know that there's
nothing funny about this,

35:06.205 --> 35:07.706
right?
They got what was
coming to them.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.774
Yeah, unlike you.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.409
Oh, come on.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.311
You know, if I had your talent,

35:12.344 --> 35:14.413
and got to do what you did
for a living,

35:14.446 --> 35:16.515
I'd have a little bit more
respect for the game.

35:16.548 --> 35:17.816
Instead of acting like a jerk.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.689
What position you play?
What?

35:23.722 --> 35:25.724
You're a player, aren't you?
(phone rings)

35:25.757 --> 35:26.892
Yeah, I played defenseman.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.427
Where'd you play?

35:28.460 --> 35:29.628
In college.

35:29.661 --> 35:30.629
You get drafted?

35:31.763 --> 35:33.532
Nope. Wasn't good enough.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.633
Bet you still skate, though.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.734
Yeah, I can hold my own.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.303
So you get it,
then, right?

35:37.336 --> 35:39.838
It's about the action,
the juice.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.707
You probably wish you were
on the ice with me.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.742
Sometimes I wish
I was with you guys,

35:43.775 --> 35:45.811
out on the street,
kicking ass.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.247
What you guys do isn't a game.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.249
I knew you could take
anybody in this place.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.683
I just wanted to see it.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.819
Hey, guys from the home invasion
crew barricaded

35:53.852 --> 35:56.488
in another house.
All hands on deck. Let's go.
Oh, I got shotgun!

35:56.522 --> 35:58.757
No, no. No, you're not
coming with us.
Oh, okay,

35:58.790 --> 36:01.293
fine.
I'll just wait here

36:01.327 --> 36:03.462
and talk to my
new friends.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.797
(sighs)

36:05.831 --> 36:08.667
Come on. Let's go.
Come on, hurry up.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.636
(siren chirping)

36:13.339 --> 36:15.574
You guys have an extra vest
or am I good without one?

36:15.607 --> 36:17.509
You joking right now?

36:17.543 --> 36:18.577
All right, you know what,
Luca, I think there's one

36:18.610 --> 36:19.445
in the back, there.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.213
(grunts)

36:21.247 --> 36:23.249
Dude, come on!
Hey, two minutes in the box.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.784
For what?
For being a pain in my ass
all day.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.686
I can watch the back
door or something.
Like you said, Bobby,

36:27.719 --> 36:30.589
this isn't a game.
(grunts)

36:33.725 --> 36:34.893
Please let us
go. If...

36:34.926 --> 36:36.662
if you, if you
let us go...
Shut up!

36:36.695 --> 36:39.765
What do we do, surrender?
You want to go to jail?

36:39.798 --> 36:42.434
Huh? I'm not
going to jail.

36:49.908 --> 36:53.011
We-we kill the dad
to show the cops we're serious.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.946
Have them get us a car
so we get out of here.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.282
CORBY: Please, no, no!
CASH: I said

36:56.315 --> 36:57.516
shut up!

37:02.388 --> 37:03.922
What is that?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.826
What is that?

37:11.997 --> 37:13.565
(screams)

37:13.599 --> 37:14.666
HONDO:
Metro SWAT!

37:19.738 --> 37:21.673
Deacon, right side.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.611
Right side clear.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.813
Left side clear.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.319
(distant thump)

37:33.352 --> 37:33.885
Upstairs.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.857
Deacon out!

37:38.890 --> 37:39.891
Luca out!

37:49.635 --> 37:51.570
(distant thumping)

37:53.104 --> 37:54.340
Give me a two!

37:58.410 --> 38:00.312
(door cracks)

38:00.346 --> 38:02.013
Get down! Get down,
down, down! Down!
Down, down! Down!

38:02.047 --> 38:03.515
Please. Please.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.083
We got one!

38:05.116 --> 38:06.985
Yeah.

38:12.458 --> 38:14.593
(gunshots)

38:23.769 --> 38:25.337
(indistinct conversations)

38:34.380 --> 38:35.947
(grunts)

38:35.981 --> 38:38.784
Yeah, that's right!
Your ass is going down.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.786
SWAT, fool!

38:40.819 --> 38:42.821
(panting):
Is that Bobby Strock?

38:42.854 --> 38:43.955
Yeah.

38:43.989 --> 38:45.757
I hate that guy.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.829
(knocking)

38:55.934 --> 38:58.470
Survivor's gonna
give up April.

38:58.504 --> 39:02.508
Says she and Cash
met at a club.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.976
They started hooking up,
he wanted money.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.812
She wanted revenge
against the girls

39:06.845 --> 39:08.013
and her ex.
So she told him

39:08.046 --> 39:09.648
where the parents
kept the jewelry,

39:09.681 --> 39:12.050
and all she wanted
was them on film.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.819
Who turns teenage grudges
into home invasions

39:13.852 --> 39:15.987
and humiliation videos?
Well, I can remember

39:16.021 --> 39:18.690
more than one teenage grudge in
my hood that led to a drive-by.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.726
Same mentality,

39:20.759 --> 39:23.462
just... different weapon.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.731
We found the videos,
by the way.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.566
They won't get out.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.535
Good work.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.069
(soft chuckle)

39:36.808 --> 39:39.177
Your mouth is saying
"good work," but...

39:39.210 --> 39:42.648
your eyes are saying
something else.

39:42.681 --> 39:45.016
Want to talk about it?

39:45.050 --> 39:47.986
We caught these guys
in less than a day,

39:48.019 --> 39:51.923
but that double murder in
South L.A. is still unsolved.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.792
And nobody there
has called to complain.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.529
City councilperson
isn't barking down your door

39:57.563 --> 39:59.130
demanding answers, huh?

39:59.164 --> 40:01.500
So you're wondering how
do we improve a community

40:01.533 --> 40:03.101
so used to
being overlooked

40:03.134 --> 40:04.970
that they don't get
outraged by it anymore.

40:05.003 --> 40:06.638
Something like that.
And you're telling me

40:06.672 --> 40:08.106
you haven't solved that yet?

40:08.139 --> 40:09.841
I mean, come on,
you've had, what,

40:09.875 --> 40:11.910
a whole eight hours?
Seven hours

40:11.943 --> 40:14.446
and 42 minutes.
You got a councilwoman

40:14.480 --> 40:16.782
on your ass and I got suburban
dads coming after me

40:16.815 --> 40:18.584
with a golf club.
That's one hell of a day.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.987
But it's over.

40:22.020 --> 40:24.790
The only SWAT out there
is real SWAT.

40:24.823 --> 40:28.760
At least take a minute
to enjoy that victory.

40:28.794 --> 40:32.030
We're gonna change things
for the better, Jessica.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.032
Together.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.767
And we're just getting started.

40:39.170 --> 40:40.906
Just once around the block.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.141
You can't drive
the truck, man.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.176
Do I have you guys
tomorrow, too?

40:45.210 --> 40:46.645
One more day.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.246
Yeah, well, tomorrow,

40:48.279 --> 40:50.081
I think maybe I can
make it up to you.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.891
It's not about the self-
defense aspect for me.

40:59.925 --> 41:02.093
It's more like
therapy, I guess.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.896
I just get lost in it, and
I leave my pain in the bag.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.131
All right, remember
what I told you--

41:06.164 --> 41:07.232
just feet solid
on the ground.

41:07.265 --> 41:09.735
Punch, don't push.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.737
Okay, now picture those guys
and really hit it hard.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.672
Come on.
Jab...

41:13.705 --> 41:15.173
the right.
There you go.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.575
It's fun.
Harder.

41:16.608 --> 41:17.909
Yes.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.186
* You might think

41:28.219 --> 41:32.223
* I'm coming to the brink

41:32.257 --> 41:34.993
* I guess we'll see

41:35.026 --> 41:39.164
* If I keep it
all together now... *

41:39.197 --> 41:42.033
See you got the message.
I almost didn't
believe you, but okay.

41:42.067 --> 41:43.569
Get 'em, Deac!
Yeah, Deac!

41:43.602 --> 41:44.202
Knock 'em on their ass!
Yeah, Deac!

41:46.271 --> 41:48.073
This is crazy.

41:48.106 --> 41:50.108
* The lines drawn, so...

41:50.141 --> 41:52.077
Here they come, here they come.
There he is,

41:52.110 --> 41:53.579
there he is.
There he goes, that's our bo...

41:53.612 --> 41:55.180
Oh!
Oh!

41:55.213 --> 41:56.815
That is not okay.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.517
* Bring it on, bring it on

42:01.086 --> 42:03.589
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

42:03.622 --> 42:06.725
Ha! Now, this is getting me
into hockey.

42:06.758 --> 42:09.194
(whooping)
Yeah, Deac!

42:09.227 --> 42:10.762
Proud of you!
