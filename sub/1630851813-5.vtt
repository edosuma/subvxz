at Carter Fassbender.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.321
Three years ago, his
company, Hunter Endeavors,

09:43.365 --> 09:44.801
needed a defense team
for a string

09:44.845 --> 09:47.630
of personal injury suits
at their construction site.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.720
The same construction site where
Mac's body was found today.

09:50.764 --> 09:51.808
Yes.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.027
Seemed like

09:53.070 --> 09:55.029
we might rep Carter,
but once Mac realized

09:55.072 --> 09:57.597
all the evidence
pointed to Carter's guilt,

09:57.640 --> 09:59.294
he called off the deal.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.731
Murder because you and Mac
reneged on a deal?

10:01.775 --> 10:04.081
That seems a bit extreme.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.953
Not if you look
at their history.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.607
Even after we
declined their offer,

We'll reach out to you

10:25.059 --> 10:26.408

any further questions.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.308

18:57.223 --> 18:59.529

it could be worse.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.140
I know it.

19:01.183 --> 19:06.754
You saw Hoyt die,
and I found Emily's body.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.364
Both were so awful.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.540
I can't imagine it

19:10.584 --> 19:12.412

19:13.891 --> 19:16.198

your best friend die.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.330
Yeah.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.419
I can't imagine it
being your soul mate.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.726
That's what happened to Dru.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.206
God, poor guy.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.382
I'm sure it'd be hard
for anyone, of course.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.210
Yeah.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.385
Now, I know you're old friends,

19:29.429 --> 19:31.909
but I think your hand's
on my date, man.

19:31.953 --> 19:35.086
Oh, is this a date?Date?

19:35.130 --> 19:38.394
Maybe 30% was grief, sure,

19:38.438 --> 19:41.528
but 70% was first
date awkward,

19:41.571 --> 19:43.443

19:44.748 --> 19:46.272
Am I wrong?

19:47.621 --> 19:51.581
You know, uh, I'm gonna
leave y'all alone.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.018
Uh, yeah.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.195

20:06.857 --> 20:09.643

20:09.686 --> 20:11.253

20:11.297 --> 20:13.951
Carter Fassbender.
Ranger Ramirez.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.431
This is A.D.A. Walker.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.433
We're here about your
Webly revolver.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.522
You reported it stolen
three years ago.

20:19.566 --> 20:22.177
They send a Ranger out for this?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.527
But yes, I did.
In the Florida Keys.

20:24.571 --> 20:25.746
Has it turned up?No.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.138
But one of its bullets has,

20:27.182 --> 20:29.315
at one of your
construction sites.Odd,

20:29.358 --> 20:31.273
since I never took it there.

20:31.317 --> 20:32.448
Not once.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.146
Well, if it was stolen,
somebody did.

20:35.190 --> 20:38.933
So who could have stolen it
that wanted to hurt Mac Lippey?

20:39.847 --> 20:41.675
Mac had a lot of enemies.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.243
Myself included, frankly.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.637
It's a shame, though.
I liked Remy.

20:47.681 --> 20:48.899
The only reason
we didn't hire him

20:48.943 --> 20:50.249
was because he ditched
our meeting.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.033
Left us high and dry
without a warning.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.384
Did he ever say why?Yeah.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.994
He blamed it on car trouble.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.388
Said he had to get towed from
out in the desert or something.

21:00.781 --> 21:03.000
Thank you, Mr. Fassbender.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.915
We'll be in touch.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.396
Have a good day.You, too.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.835
Carter and Remy were
still in talks

21:11.879 --> 21:13.663
after Mac disapproved?

21:13.707 --> 21:15.012
I mean, he mentioned car trouble

21:15.056 --> 21:16.840
but nothing about
being towed.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.842
Right. Okay,

21:18.886 --> 21:20.409
let's track down
the towing company.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.281
If they picked up Remy's car
near the construction site,

21:22.324 --> 21:25.240
that puts him at the scene
of the crime.

21:27.329 --> 21:30.027
Hey, that's Mac's
daughter Willa.

21:30.071 --> 21:33.379
She's the same person
at the crime scene.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.426
Willa. Willa, stop!

21:37.470 --> 21:40.211
Sir, can you close
the exits?Ranger. Willa, stop!

21:40.255 --> 21:42.866

21:42.910 --> 21:46.348

Oh, so sorry. Willa!

21:52.398 --> 21:55.183

stay where you are.

21:56.184 --> 21:57.533
Willa, stop.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.797

22:00.841 --> 22:01.537
Please.

22:07.717 --> 22:10.329
Willa, why were you
at the crime scene?

22:13.897 --> 22:15.377
Willa...

22:15.421 --> 22:19.076
hey, we are trying
to solve

22:19.120 --> 22:21.035
your father's cold case,
so if there's anything...

22:21.078 --> 22:23.820
Everyone's been
tryingfor years.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.082
We know that you're
frustrated.

22:25.126 --> 22:26.910
I read in that report
that you checked

22:26.954 --> 22:28.390
on this case every month.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.391
Why did you stop?

22:29.435 --> 22:31.350
'Cause no one had
any answers.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.353
But today they dug up
my father's body.

22:35.179 --> 22:37.138
Do you know what that
was like for me?

22:38.095 --> 22:40.010
You think you want answers,
and then you get

22:40.054 --> 22:43.144
the worst one imaginable.

22:43.187 --> 22:45.189
It was like I lost him
all over again.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.931
Yeah, I know you
must be hurting.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.455

22:49.498 --> 22:50.804
I...

22:50.847 --> 22:52.893
Wewant to help you, Willa.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.244
Willa, are you sure

22:56.287 --> 22:58.159
there isn't anything
you can tell us

22:58.202 --> 23:02.293
that could help us bring your
father's murderer to justice?

23:02.337 --> 23:05.558
The only thing I know for sure
is that I didn't kill my father.

23:05.601 --> 23:08.778
Aside from that,
I don't have any answers.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.650
No one seems to.

23:10.693 --> 23:13.087
Even my uncle couldn't
put it together.

23:14.958 --> 23:18.440
I feel like you're holding
something in, Willa.

23:18.484 --> 23:19.920
And I've been there.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.878
So whatever you decide
to do with that,

23:21.922 --> 23:24.794
just make sure it doesn't
consume you.

23:26.840 --> 23:30.104
We're not gonna hold you today.
You're free to go.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.110

change your mind.

that we don't.

23:43.944 --> 23:47.774

she's a bomb.

23:48.949 --> 23:50.254
Okay, let's put a tail
on her and see

23:50.298 --> 23:53.257

comes to light soon.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.216
Okay.
Micki, I'll defer to you.

30:03.976 --> 30:06.848
And you watched me suffer
for years.

30:06.892 --> 30:10.721
And you knew the truth.
What you did.

30:10.765 --> 30:13.899
Tell them.
Tell them!

30:14.813 --> 30:16.989
You better start talking, Remy.

30:18.338 --> 30:21.471
We were arguing

30:21.515 --> 30:25.040
more about money we lost
turning down cases.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.302
Mac wouldn't bend.

30:26.346 --> 30:29.262
And I worked
the Hunter Endeavors deal out

30:29.305 --> 30:32.961
behind his back, and Carter
and I even became friends.

30:33.005 --> 30:36.051
A-And I stole his gun
on a trip.

30:36.095 --> 30:39.185
So you planned to murder Mac.I just took it to have it.

30:39.228 --> 30:42.405
Didn't think he'd miss it,
given his collection.

30:42.449 --> 30:45.147
I took Mac to
the construction site

30:45.191 --> 30:46.670
before the signing meeting

30:46.714 --> 30:48.368
so that he could see
their progress.

30:48.411 --> 30:51.023
And then we would get a huge
payout thanks to me.

30:52.894 --> 30:56.202
But Mac lost it,
and he insulted me.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.943
Like he had for years.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.596
So you shot him?

31:02.991 --> 31:05.515
I panicked.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.736
Buried Mac there
at the construction site.

31:08.779 --> 31:11.870
I tried to speed off.
I popped the tire.

31:11.913 --> 31:15.482
And my head wasn't right,
and I missed that big meeting

31:15.525 --> 31:17.049
with Carter,
and I lost the deal.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.833
I-I-I lost so much.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.139
Oh, you lost so much?

31:20.182 --> 31:21.575
You lost so much?!

31:21.618 --> 31:25.361
Don't! Don't!
Willa, look at me.

31:25.405 --> 31:28.234
I know how you must feel.
You want revenge bad,

31:28.277 --> 31:29.975
and you think it's
in that gun in your hands.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.759
But it's not, Willa.

31:31.802 --> 31:34.805
[crying]

31:34.849 --> 31:36.938
He deserves to die!

31:38.548 --> 31:40.855
He deserves to die
for what he did to me,

31:40.899 --> 31:42.944
and what he did to my family.

31:46.643 --> 31:50.212
You're right. You shouldn't
be in this position.

31:51.257 --> 31:54.477
The man I once loved
influenced my life,

31:54.521 --> 31:58.699
but he put me
in a bad place, too.

31:58.742 --> 32:01.832
So I had to let go of
one life to save another.

32:01.876 --> 32:05.662
My own. I didn't
have a choice.

32:05.706 --> 32:08.100
But right now you do, Willa.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.928
Choose yourself.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.104
Choose you.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.116

32:28.381 --> 32:30.818

32:33.777 --> 32:35.910
ABELINE:
This was a good idea, Bonham.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.391
And the Ranch Waters
didn't hurt either.

32:38.434 --> 32:39.958
Mm!

32:40.001 --> 32:42.961
You know, I can't imagine
driving a casserole

32:43.004 --> 32:45.398
out to the ranch,
then going fishing with us

32:45.441 --> 32:46.616
was the top of your plans.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.183
Thank you.
Uh, well,

32:48.227 --> 32:52.187

[chuckles]

33:00.413 --> 33:02.632
What's weighing
on your mind?

33:04.112 --> 33:07.028
You and Abby are so solid, man.
[chuckles]

33:07.072 --> 33:09.161
Micki and I are...

33:09.204 --> 33:11.250
Well, we're shaky.

33:11.293 --> 33:12.468
This might sound simple,

33:12.512 --> 33:15.950
but, you know, maybe
she just needs time.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.257
You'll weather the storm.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.042
Let Micki sort her feelings
about Garrison out

33:21.086 --> 33:22.043

33:22.087 --> 33:23.958
Garrison?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.742
Who's that?

33:27.309 --> 33:32.140
Uh, maybe I'm confusing my
stories, but... [exhales]

33:32.184 --> 33:34.534
My advice holds.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.318
Wait for her to come to you.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.668
Huh.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.280
Patience.

33:41.323 --> 33:42.977
Yeah.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.154
Can you close that
up for me, please?Yeah. Yeah, sure.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.857
So, turns out
Remy's car was towed

33:53.901 --> 33:55.163
from Hunter's
construction site,

33:55.207 --> 33:57.035
which puts him at
the crime scene.Yep.

33:57.078 --> 34:00.299
That along with his confession
and having Carter's gun...

34:00.342 --> 34:02.997
I mean, this case? Solid.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.738
That's great.

We can't keep fighting
with each other.

We got to work through this.

Liam, I trust you more than
anyone at the D.A.'s office.

You're my family.
But I can be loyal to you

34:23.844 --> 34:26.455
and civil to them.
So can you.

34:26.499 --> 34:29.241
Civil.[chuckles]:
Yeah.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.808
I can give that a try.Good.

34:31.852 --> 34:34.072
We make a decent team,
though, don't we?

34:34.115 --> 34:35.116
Damn right, we do.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.683

But,

34:42.645 --> 34:45.735

You're never driving again.

Hey.

35:10.238 --> 35:13.328
I owe you an apology.

35:16.070 --> 35:18.246
When you got home...
[chuckles]

35:18.290 --> 35:22.555
...I wanted you back out
in the field with me right away.

35:22.598 --> 35:25.732
I mean, I-I wanted to
be side by side again,

35:25.775 --> 35:26.907
together again

35:26.950 --> 35:30.563
so badly
that I didn't take into account

35:30.606 --> 35:34.088
that the way I came back
from the Rodeo Kings was

35:34.132 --> 35:37.178
very different than the way
you came back from Del Rio.

35:37.222 --> 35:40.616
And I can't imagine the
choice you had to make.

35:40.660 --> 35:42.052
I-I can't imagine

35:42.096 --> 35:44.664
what you had to let go of
with him.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.146
I'm sorry.

35:48.885 --> 35:51.888
Thank you for saying that.
[chuckles]

35:51.932 --> 35:54.108
Um...[clears throat]

35:54.152 --> 35:56.458
Yeah, I-I...

35:57.242 --> 35:59.592
I think it took until today

35:59.635 --> 36:02.595
with Willa for me to even...

36:02.638 --> 36:06.425
begin to understand
what I've been feeling

36:06.468 --> 36:09.210
about Del Rio and...

36:09.254 --> 36:11.995
Garrison.

36:12.039 --> 36:14.607
And, um...

36:14.650 --> 36:16.435
How are you feeling?

36:16.478 --> 36:17.914
It feels good

36:17.958 --> 36:19.786
to...

36:19.829 --> 36:21.918
begin to articulate it.

36:21.962 --> 36:25.183
Good.[chuckles]:
That's been really hard to do.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.622
But, um...

But why?

36:41.460 --> 36:43.679
What for? I...

36:45.290 --> 36:49.859
I never thought
about why I wanted it so badly.

wh-when we do change--

37:03.308 --> 37:04.439

37:04.483 --> 37:09.139
that we change for the better.
