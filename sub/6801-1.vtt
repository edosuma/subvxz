- Hello! Anybody?
- What?

05:20.933 --> 05:23.735

- I was just trying to help out our little Kimber,

05:23.736 --> 05:26.204

she's going all Katniss on me.

05:26.205 --> 05:29.574

She turned it into a denim napkin.

I'm going to play you a
song that I wrote, obviously.

12:53.119 --> 12:56.053

12:56.054 --> 12:58.423
Oh, hey, I didn't see you there.

You done?

15:44.289 --> 15:45.355
(sighs)

15:45.356 --> 15:47.826
Hey, Kimber. Um,

15:47.827 --> 15:50.495
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have
to figure this one out for yourself.

15:50.496 --> 15:53.365
You didn't record anything?

15:53.399 --> 15:57.000
I don't know what you're so scared of, J.

15:57.001 --> 15:59.403
But whatever it is, you don't have to be.

15:59.404 --> 16:05.577
Besides, I think you look pretty
good in your rockin' hair and makeup.

16:09.347 --> 16:11.984

17:18.217 --> 17:20.385
Uh, guys, something's
happening with the Internet.

17:20.386 --> 17:23.021
Just unplug the cable thingy
and then plug it back in again.

17:23.021 --> 17:25.055
Really, Shana? "The cable thingy"?

17:25.056 --> 17:27.691
No, I mean, like, something's
happening that you really need to see.

17:27.692 --> 17:29.927
Okay.

17:29.928 --> 17:32.196
Oh, my gosh!

17:32.197 --> 17:33.531
Shana, you have to come here right now.

17:33.532 --> 17:36.935
- I don't know how this is happening.
- Are you serious right now?

17:36.936 --> 17:39.437
- Hurry up.
- Every time I refresh it, it just keeps going up.

17:39.438 --> 17:41.004
- What?
- No way!

17:41.005 --> 17:42.172

Check your YouTube account.

18:17.743 --> 18:21.745
Guys, the Erica Raymond just
asked Jem to do three shows in LA.

18:21.746 --> 18:23.180
- That is crazy!
- Amazing.

18:23.181 --> 18:25.116
Look at the money that she's offering.

18:25.117 --> 18:28.285
You. Did you do this,
Kimber? What the hell?

18:28.286 --> 18:30.388
- You know how I feel about these things.
- No, this is awesome!

18:30.389 --> 18:32.122
We're sisters and we're
supposed to help each other.

18:32.123 --> 18:36.761
You helped me with the music video, so I helped
you overcome your crippling online shyness

18:36.762 --> 18:38.428
and boom, win-win.

18:38.429 --> 18:40.130
And you're wearing the necklace I designed.

18:40.131 --> 18:42.399
36,000 freakin' people
just saw my necklace.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.003
- Can you please link that to my Etsy account?
- Yeah, what's your log-in?

18:45.004 --> 18:48.206
J, don't worry. The video's
public, but my account's private.

18:48.207 --> 18:51.109
So nobody knows who
uploaded it or who's in it.

18:51.110 --> 18:54.779
All they know is that she calls herself
Jem, and they seriously like her.

18:54.780 --> 18:56.613
Actually, they love her!

18:56.614 --> 19:00.251
Except that guy. And that one. Scroll down.

19:00.252 --> 19:03.154
Ooh, that guy really doesn't like her.

19:03.155 --> 19:05.555
Oh, my God! I'm not letting
you be upset about this.

19:05.556 --> 19:09.694
You're Internet famous. That's the second
best thing to being actually famous.

19:09.695 --> 19:13.197
Jerrica, she does have a point. You're
getting hits like water-skiing squirrel.

19:13.198 --> 19:15.632
- I love water-skiing squirrel!
- Yes! He's so cute.

19:15.633 --> 19:18.636
When they first put him on the thing
and then he just balances on the water.

19:18.637 --> 19:23.876
- He doesn't even fall off. I can't even do that.
- Like, so badly. So badly.

19:25.276 --> 19:27.110
You're way more than
water-skiing squirrel.

19:27.111 --> 19:30.180
J, you can't be upset about this.
This doesn't happen every day.

19:30.181 --> 19:33.383
The Erica Raymond just direct-messaged us.

19:33.384 --> 19:36.219
I always knew you'd go viral.

19:36.220 --> 19:39.791
- That just sounds gross.
- AJA: You're gonna be famous!

19:39.792 --> 19:43.896
- (laughing)
- MAN: There you go.

20:01.080 --> 20:05.783
(sighs) The version of me that they want
doesn't... It doesn't exist, Aunt Bailey.

20:05.784 --> 20:11.722
If I go on stage, they're
not gonna see this... Jem.

20:11.723 --> 20:17.729
They're gonna see this small-town wannabe
who writes songs to sing in her shower.

20:17.763 --> 20:20.797
I think you're absolutely right.

20:20.798 --> 20:23.101
You are no rock star.

20:24.469 --> 20:27.638
Right. Yeah. No, that's
exactly what I'm saying.

20:27.639 --> 20:31.210
I think you have the potential to
become something so much greater.

20:33.245 --> 20:35.780
Aunt Bailey, just...
please, just listen, okay?

20:35.781 --> 20:37.648
No, you listen.

20:37.649 --> 20:39.550
There are some ideas,

20:39.551 --> 20:43.088
some voices that are too
special to keep hidden.

20:44.422 --> 20:47.191
Those are your father's words.

20:48.627 --> 20:51.696
You know, when we were growing up here
in this house, our lives were here.

20:51.697 --> 20:56.201
But your dad was always talking
about what was out there.

20:57.236 --> 20:59.469
And as soon as he was old enough,

20:59.470 --> 21:02.206
he went out to make it happen.

21:02.207 --> 21:04.875
I think you're more like your dad.

21:04.909 --> 21:06.878
Maybe your life is out there.

21:06.879 --> 21:10.514
It's just that I know that this could

21:10.515 --> 21:12.716
really help with the
family and the house and...

21:12.717 --> 21:15.386
This is not about the house.

21:15.387 --> 21:19.189
Okay, this is about you
not going your whole life

21:19.190 --> 21:23.194
wondering what would have happened
if you had taken that chance.

21:23.195 --> 21:28.166

you had the chance to go back to LA?

21:28.167 --> 21:29.699

25:09.521 --> 25:11.421
So, Miss Raymond, I have to tell you

25:11.422 --> 25:14.891
that profile in <i>The

25:14.892 --> 25:16.694

25:16.695 --> 25:18.661

25:49.727 --> 25:52.562
The whole world wants to
know who you are right now.

25:52.563 --> 25:55.498
Which means so much free publicity.

25:55.499 --> 25:59.736
This is exactly the artist that
Starlight has been looking for.

25:59.737 --> 26:04.475
Equal parts talent and
mystery. Talent, mystery.

26:04.476 --> 26:08.579
Which reminds me. Twitter,
Instagram, Tumblr, all of that,

26:08.580 --> 26:11.114

26:20.825 --> 26:23.060

26:23.061 --> 26:27.731
I want you all to think of this as
an opportunity to reinvent yourselves.

26:27.732 --> 26:33.771
Escape. Forget all that dismal
mediocrity that you grew up in.

26:33.772 --> 26:38.809

who... who do you want to be?

26:38.810 --> 26:41.544
Who is that person?
What does she look like?

26:41.545 --> 26:43.813

the way you want to be.

27:51.550 --> 27:52.783
Thank you.

27:52.784 --> 27:54.685
- ERICA: You ready for the big adventure?
- Yes.

27:54.686 --> 27:59.023
Oh, good. Well, I took the liberty
of arranging for some new instruments.

27:59.024 --> 28:01.091
- This is love at first sight.
- AJA: Vipers?

28:01.092 --> 28:03.528
Dude, that's sick.

28:05.697 --> 28:07.264
How cool is that?

28:07.265 --> 28:10.234
ERICA: And ladies, this
is Rio, our college intern.

28:10.235 --> 28:13.803
He'll take care of everything you need
while you're here, so just go to him.

28:13.804 --> 28:16.573
- Hi, girls.
- Nice to meet you.

28:16.574 --> 28:19.743
First, a couple of ground
rules... no drinking, no smoking

28:19.744 --> 28:22.079
and absolutely no going
out after midnight curfew.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.180
I thought rock stars were
allowed to do all that stuff.

28:24.181 --> 28:27.150
Well, I'll bear that in
mind when I meet some.

28:27.151 --> 28:30.120
Until then, follow the rules
and stay out of trouble.

28:30.121 --> 28:32.956
ERICA: Okay. Let's go.

28:32.957 --> 28:36.225
- Weird meeting you.
- Likewise.

28:36.226 --> 28:39.531
Oh, and, uh, good luck
with your style session.

28:43.735 --> 28:46.603
MAN: This is Starlight Enterprises,

28:46.604 --> 28:48.871
the house that Erica built.

28:48.872 --> 28:52.610
That means changing the way
you act, the way you sound

28:52.611 --> 28:54.945
and the way you look.

28:54.946 --> 28:57.880
Ladies, I give you Erica Raymond.

28:57.881 --> 29:00.883
Thank you, Esteban. (chuckles)

29:00.884 --> 29:03.654
Okay.

29:03.688 --> 29:06.491
Kimber.

29:08.692 --> 29:12.730
Hmm. Not trying enough.

29:13.765 --> 29:18.368
Aja. Haven't quite figured you out yet.

29:18.402 --> 29:19.937
Oh, no, I got it.

29:19.938 --> 29:24.141
You don't try at all. That's awful.

29:24.175 --> 29:26.843
Shana.

29:26.844 --> 29:29.178
Esteban, are you looking
at this? (clears throat)

29:29.179 --> 29:34.784
It reminds me of people
who dress up their animals.

29:34.785 --> 29:37.821
Trying too hard.

29:37.855 --> 29:38.956
Jem.

29:38.957 --> 29:40.323
My Jem.

29:40.324 --> 29:43.260
That's what we call you now.

29:43.261 --> 29:45.795
- Interesting...
- Thank you.

29:45.796 --> 29:47.930
if you live in the Valley.

29:47.931 --> 29:50.668
Oh, my God, those boots.

29:50.669 --> 29:52.936
I had those in high school,

29:52.937 --> 29:55.438
and I got made fun of so much.

29:55.439 --> 29:57.675
But I digress. (clears throat)

29:57.676 --> 30:00.878
You're gonna have to lose the
earrings. They're so last season.

30:00.879 --> 30:03.046
- Like 30 years ago.
- Oh.

30:03.047 --> 30:05.081
Don't worry, we'll hold
them for safekeeping.

30:05.082 --> 30:07.016
Okay.

30:07.017 --> 30:09.186
Thank you.

30:09.187 --> 30:12.889
We'll get there. I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy, 'cause it's not.

30:12.890 --> 30:15.825
It's gonna be challenging and exciting.

30:15.826 --> 30:18.328
You're giving us new looks?

30:18.329 --> 30:20.632
We already have.

30:22.266 --> 30:25.235
"Jem. Uncover the mystery."

30:25.236 --> 30:26.704
What?

30:26.705 --> 30:29.106
Uncover the mystery.

30:29.107 --> 30:31.241
I'm so glad I thought of that.

30:31.242 --> 30:33.276
This is us?

30:33.277 --> 30:34.945
No, it's Photoshop.

30:34.946 --> 30:38.748
But it will become a reality
before the first show.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.752
Rehearsal starts in 20 minutes on Sunset.

30:41.753 --> 30:43.920
The sooner we have a single to leak,

30:43.921 --> 30:46.924
the sooner you become
the girls in the poster.

30:46.925 --> 30:50.427
We're gonna have fun.

30:50.461 --> 30:53.030
Lot of hours, though, in the day.

Cappuccino flyin' in.

32:52.350 --> 32:55.218
- (door closes)
- We'll just keep on practicing.

32:55.219 --> 32:59.857
Mrs... Mrs. Raymond, it's a
pleasure, always, to see you.

32:59.858 --> 33:03.560
I, uh... I was wondering if you listened to
my demo yet. I was just thinking about it.

33:03.561 --> 33:05.595
Do you have any response to it yet?

33:05.596 --> 33:08.464
Uh...

33:08.498 --> 33:10.466
So, yeah, I'll bring it around.

33:10.467 --> 33:12.268
Bring the car.

33:12.269 --> 33:15.506
That happens all the time. (chuckles)

33:15.540 --> 33:18.074
So, we'll pick things up tomorrow.

33:18.075 --> 33:23.547
In the meantime, I've arranged for your
transportation to take you where you're staying.

33:23.581 --> 33:25.549
We get to borrow your car? Really?

33:25.550 --> 33:27.484
(laughs) Never!

33:27.485 --> 33:29.920
No, your ride is over there.

33:29.921 --> 33:31.554
(engine revving)

33:31.555 --> 33:34.391
What are you waiting for, Little
Miss Pink Hair and the Sing-Alongs?

33:34.392 --> 33:35.993
Hop on in.

33:35.994 --> 33:39.429
Everything was going so well.

33:39.430 --> 33:41.063
Hello, Rio.

33:41.064 --> 33:42.966
Does this thing even have seat belts?

33:42.967 --> 33:45.703
We just got our hair done too.

33:56.648 --> 33:57.980
(tires screeching)

33:57.981 --> 33:59.917
- Are you...
- All right.

33:59.918 --> 34:02.118
- Was that necessary?
- We are home.

34:02.119 --> 34:04.254
He's the worst driver... ever.

34:04.255 --> 34:08.625
All right, this is Starlight
Mansion. Your room is upstairs.

34:08.626 --> 34:11.560
Hey, are these for us?

34:11.561 --> 34:13.297
No?

34:13.297 --> 34:14.665
Yes?

34:14.666 --> 34:16.667
Thank you. I will take this.

34:16.668 --> 34:18.634
This is amazing.

34:18.635 --> 34:20.938
You can see the Hollywood sign.

34:20.938 --> 34:22.705
Stop. What are you doing?

34:22.706 --> 34:24.975
- I'll put them back later.
- When's later?

34:24.976 --> 34:26.944
- Shh.
- You have a problem.

34:26.945 --> 34:29.013
Duh.

34:30.514 --> 34:33.083
(no audible dialogue)

34:36.387 --> 34:38.955
This is your room. I'm just down the hall.

34:38.956 --> 34:42.025
Call if the place is on fire. Bother
housekeeping if there's anything else.

34:42.025 --> 34:46.029
And remember, midnight means lights
out on your little slumber party.

34:46.030 --> 34:48.230
- Any questions?
- SHANA: Nope.

34:48.231 --> 34:49.399
Mm-mmm.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.201
Perfect. Have a good night, ladies.

34:52.202 --> 34:55.605
- KIMBER: Thank you, Rio.
- SHANA: Thank you.

34:55.639 --> 34:58.542
Yeah, I actually do have
one really quick question.

34:58.543 --> 35:01.110
AJA: This is my bed. You
have to move your stuff.

35:01.111 --> 35:05.348
I know that Erica said that this
room has, like, a specific name.

35:05.349 --> 35:08.250
And I was just wondering if maybe
you could help me remember it.

35:08.251 --> 35:11.520
- It's the Rock Star Suite.
- Oh! The Rock Star Suite.

35:11.521 --> 35:14.424
Oh, that's right. Thank you.

35:14.425 --> 35:19.463
Um, well, hey, maybe that means
you have met some after all. Hmm?

35:19.497 --> 35:21.697
(door closes)

35:21.698 --> 35:24.567
Is anyone else so tired they
can't even take their shoes off?

35:24.568 --> 35:27.536
I'm so tired I can't
even try my new ones on.

35:27.537 --> 35:30.507
(sighs) Man.

35:30.508 --> 35:33.542
I would have never guessed that coming
here would mean a whole new Jerrica.

35:33.543 --> 35:35.979
You mean Jem.

35:37.414 --> 35:40.384
Right. Jem.

35:40.385 --> 35:42.152
<i>JERRICA (narrating):

35:55.032 --> 35:58.869
it was happening. (sighs)

everything would be different...</i>

- What?

36:20.258 --> 36:23.092
You gotta see this.

36:23.093 --> 36:24.694
- What is that?
- JERRICA: I don't know.

36:24.695 --> 36:27.230
- You guys, I gotta get this on camera.
- This is not a good idea.

36:27.231 --> 36:29.233
We'll just go together. We'll be fine.

36:31.769 --> 36:34.237
KIMBER: It's a little after midnight,

36:34.238 --> 36:38.308
and we're about to make contact
with a mysterious entity.

36:38.309 --> 36:41.344
- AJA: Kimber!
- KIMBER: Aja, it's fine. Shh.

36:45.249 --> 36:47.384
- AJA: I don't like this.
- KIMBER: Aja, relax.

36:47.385 --> 36:49.819
Just pull it off quickly
before something happens.

36:49.820 --> 36:51.520

Synergy?

37:12.510 --> 37:13.911
AJA: Doesn't look broken to me.

37:13.912 --> 37:18.281
Look, there's pieces missing. Maybe
he left it unfinished on purpose.

37:18.282 --> 37:19.783
KIMBER: Pick it up.

37:19.784 --> 37:22.987
Be careful.

37:35.233 --> 37:38.268
Wait, he gave that to you, like, a million
years ago. Why is it only working now?

50:48.325 --> 50:51.460
Where is this supposed girl even from?

50:51.461 --> 50:53.496
You think I would tell you, of all people?

50:53.497 --> 50:57.667
Have you read your
publication? (chuckles) No.

50:57.668 --> 51:02.705
In a world where everything is public, this is
the first true mystery of the decade, isn't it?

51:02.706 --> 51:04.674
<i>And we plan on keeping her that way.</i>

51:04.675 --> 51:06.542
Jem is a symbol,

51:06.543 --> 51:09.078
<i>you know, and her
voice speaks the truth.</i>

51:09.079 --> 51:10.612
<i>She has attitude, she has style,</i>

51:10.613 --> 51:14.350

there's so many fake Jems...

51:14.351 --> 51:17.018

51:17.019 --> 51:18.955

51:18.956 --> 51:21.257

ERICA: There are three simple rules
to taking pictures on the red carpet.

52:50.579 --> 52:53.549
First, posture makes perfect.

52:53.550 --> 52:56.518
Second, lean your weight
on the back of your leg

52:56.519 --> 52:59.587
so the camera sees you
as taller and slimmer.

52:59.588 --> 53:03.826
Third, the most important...
smile, but don't make faces.

53:03.827 --> 53:06.062
This isn't your high school graduation.

53:06.063 --> 53:08.196
Paparazzi are not your friends.

53:08.197 --> 53:11.100
And a bad photo lives longer than vampires.

53:11.101 --> 53:12.567
Got it?

53:12.568 --> 53:18.206
Stand up straight, lean back,
smile without moving our faces.

53:18.207 --> 53:20.476
Oh, and squinch.

53:20.477 --> 53:22.145
Squinch?

53:23.847 --> 53:27.216

- Yeah.

53:27.217 --> 53:29.351

01:02:20.617 --> 01:02:22.884
(screaming)

01:02:22.885 --> 01:02:24.620
TOGETHER: We love you, Jem!

01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:27.688
- I'm a huge Jem fan.
- I love Jem.

01:02:27.689 --> 01:02:30.125
Her music is amazing.
It's, like, real music.

01:02:30.126 --> 01:02:31.426
<i>- And one other one.
- Which one?</i>

01:02:31.427 --> 01:02:32.860
<i>- Jem.
- Whoa! That's what I'm talking about.</i>

01:02:32.861 --> 01:02:35.864
<i>Right now, it's already
trending on Twitter right now.</i>

01:02:35.865 --> 01:02:38.366
<i>- Hashtag Jem.
- Did you love it? Apparently he loves it.</i>

01:02:38.367 --> 01:02:41.335
<i>I love it so much. And boy,
oh, boy, they hit a home run.</i>

01:02:41.336 --> 01:02:43.739
<i>FEMALE REPORTER: Lines are
out the door at salons today.</i>

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:47.775
<i>Everyone wants the Jem hair! Pink,
purple, red, blue. You name it.</i>

01:02:47.776 --> 01:02:51.279
Uh, in this video, I will show
you how to do the makeup for Jem.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.049
I wanted to play you this
Jem-inspired song that I wrote.

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:57.351
To be able to sit down and
have a glass of wine with Jem,

01:02:57.352 --> 01:03:01.188
and just hang and chill it
like... like we're girlfriends,

01:03:01.189 --> 01:03:02.556
that would be everything.

01:03:02.557 --> 01:03:05.960
<i>MALE REPORTER: Their song, "Youngblood,"
has leaked onto the Internet</i>

01:03:05.961 --> 01:03:09.063
<i>and is clearly climbing the
streaming and download charts.</i>

01:03:09.064 --> 01:03:10.866
Oh, my God!

01:03:10.867 --> 01:03:12.833
"Youngblood." I dig the track.

01:03:12.834 --> 01:03:14.802
You gotta make a track
for me, by the way, next.

01:03:14.803 --> 01:03:17.839
You can't call it "Youngblood."
Let's call it, like, "Badass Blood."

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.676
Actually, no. That sounds like
something you don't want. Never mind.

01:03:20.677 --> 01:03:22.810
- Jem.
- <i>MALE REPORTER: But as the Jem phenomenon continues,</i>

01:03:22.811 --> 01:03:25.413
<i>the biggest question
only grows... Who is Jem?</i>

01:03:25.414 --> 01:03:27.783
<i>Jem and I dated for like six
weeks. It was pretty serious.</i>

01:03:27.784 --> 01:03:31.018
<i>MAN: I don't think she's even a real
person. She's more of a product.</i>

01:03:31.019 --> 01:03:32.721
<i>WOMAN: You know, maybe
it doesn't even matter,</i>

01:03:32.722 --> 01:03:35.089
<i>because the only thing
people want is Jem.</i>

01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:38.460
- (laughing)
- My s-sister watched it, not me.

01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:41.864
(chuckling) Let me shrink out.

01:03:43.465 --> 01:03:45.232
(knocking)

01:03:45.233 --> 01:03:48.202
Be there in a sec.

01:03:48.236 --> 01:03:49.971
- Hey... Oh!
- Oh!

01:03:49.972 --> 01:03:51.772
No. You're not wearing clothes.

01:03:51.773 --> 01:03:53.842
Um, I'm gonna come back later.

01:03:53.843 --> 01:03:55.976
I think I can fix that. Come on in.

01:03:55.977 --> 01:03:59.346
- I'll be there in a sec.
- Okay. (chuckles)

01:03:59.347 --> 01:04:02.984
Wow! I can't believe the mysterious
Jem has come to pay me a visit.

01:04:02.985 --> 01:04:04.752
Nice room you got here.

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:07.723
Yeah, well, it's not the Rock Star Suite.

01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:11.826
Uh, I just... I might be having

01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:15.263
a secret identity crisis.

01:04:15.264 --> 01:04:20.469
- I don't really have anyone else to talk to about that.
- Huh.

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:21.871
Well, it's a good thing you came over,

01:04:21.872 --> 01:04:25.406
'cause I just so happen to know the
answers to all of life's problems.

01:04:25.407 --> 01:04:28.309
What would that be?

01:04:28.343 --> 01:04:30.277
Breakfast.

01:04:30.278 --> 01:04:33.014
(chuckles)

01:04:33.048 --> 01:04:36.051
And it just seems like ever
since we got here that...

01:04:36.052 --> 01:04:39.154
that I've been leading
this double life, you know?

01:04:39.155 --> 01:04:41.522
'Cause Jem was supposed to be a disguise

01:04:41.523 --> 01:04:44.992
and something that I could hide behind.

01:04:45.026 --> 01:04:48.362
But now it just seems to
be this other version of me,

01:04:48.363 --> 01:04:52.299
and I don't know, more
and more it seems to be

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:56.871
the only version that,
you know, people want.

01:04:56.905 --> 01:04:58.906
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

01:04:58.907 --> 01:05:01.375
(chuckles) Don't get me wrong.

01:05:01.376 --> 01:05:04.312
- Jem's pretty incredible. I mean, she's talented,
- Oh!

01:05:04.313 --> 01:05:05.547
amazing on stage.

01:05:05.548 --> 01:05:09.351
She has outrageous fashion sense,
beautiful hair... just pink.

01:05:09.352 --> 01:05:11.485
- (chuckles)
- Did I ever tell you pink's my favorite color?

01:05:11.486 --> 01:05:13.087
You know, I wouldn't have guessed,

01:05:13.088 --> 01:05:15.123
- but now I can kind of see it, knowing you.
- Oh.

01:05:15.124 --> 01:05:16.991
- You know what I mean? Knowing you.
- Is that right?

01:05:16.992 --> 01:05:19.960
I really can tell that pink is...

01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:22.364
Now you're making me jealous
of my secret identity.

01:05:22.365 --> 01:05:25.333
And that is something I
did not think was possible.

01:05:25.334 --> 01:05:28.235
- (sighs)
- Well, you didn't let me finish.

01:05:28.236 --> 01:05:29.904
I mean, yes,

01:05:29.905 --> 01:05:34.810
Jem is glamour and
glitter, fashion and fame,

01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:37.212
and I can't imagine
how tempting it might be

01:05:37.213 --> 01:05:39.949
to lose yourself to something like that.

01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:44.286
When I look at you, I don't see Jem.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.087
In my eyes, you're the same incredible girl

01:05:47.088 --> 01:05:50.925
that I sang with under the pier that night.

01:05:50.959 --> 01:05:52.960
And you always will be.

01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:55.964
Don't underestimate yourself.

01:05:55.965 --> 01:05:58.534
You promise me that?

01:06:00.135 --> 01:06:02.839
I promise.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.943
(knocking)

01:06:09.378 --> 01:06:11.947
(sighs)

01:06:16.619 --> 01:06:19.855
- So, um... (clears throat)
- Oh, Erica. Hi.

01:06:19.856 --> 01:06:26.061
Um, I'm gonna go, um, work on
the guitar for the next song.

01:06:26.095 --> 01:06:28.129
This isn't what I had in mind when I said,

01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:30.065
"Keep a close eye on the girls."

01:06:30.066 --> 01:06:31.565
Listen, you've got it all wrong.

01:06:31.566 --> 01:06:33.601
She's no longer Jerrica. Okay?

01:06:33.602 --> 01:06:35.302
She's bigger than that.

01:06:35.303 --> 01:06:36.938
She's our business.

01:06:36.939 --> 01:06:38.406
And if you want a part in that business,

01:06:38.407 --> 01:06:44.279
you need to be disciplined, you need
to be all business head all the time.

01:06:44.313 --> 01:06:47.014
Honey, I want what's best for you.

01:06:47.015 --> 01:06:49.317
- No, you don't.
- You know I do.

01:06:49.318 --> 01:06:51.552
I want you to run this company one day.

01:06:51.553 --> 01:06:55.257
That's exactly what your
father would have wanted.

01:06:55.291 --> 01:06:57.292
But you don't know what you want.

01:06:57.293 --> 01:06:59.159
Just because you and I don't
see eye-to-eye sometimes,

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.895
doesn't mean I don't know what I want.

01:07:00.896 --> 01:07:02.529
I'm assigning you to a different artist.

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:04.466
This isn't working.

01:07:04.467 --> 01:07:06.567
Stay away from her.

AUNT BAILEY: Hey, don't worry about me.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:35.163
Now, you girls just concentrate
on what you're doing there.

01:07:35.164 --> 01:07:37.197
- Okay.
- And everything will be fine.

01:07:37.198 --> 01:07:39.167
I will be here when you get back. Okay?

01:07:39.168 --> 01:07:41.602
(sighs deeply) How are things at the store?

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:43.938
A little slow, but, uh,

01:07:43.939 --> 01:07:46.941
I don't know, reminds me of
when I first started, you know?

01:07:46.942 --> 01:07:49.311
Putting in the long hours, working solo.

01:07:49.312 --> 01:07:53.481
Wait, did you let the rest of the staff go?

01:07:53.515 --> 01:07:55.616
Aunt Bailey, you didn't
need to do that, okay?

01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:58.386
I'm telling you, the money is
ours at the end of the month.

01:07:58.387 --> 01:08:00.521
We have plenty of time. It's gonna be fine.

01:08:00.522 --> 01:08:03.223
- And you have the hearing coming up, so...
- We don't.

01:08:03.224 --> 01:08:05.493
Jerrica, I lost the appeal.

01:08:05.494 --> 01:08:08.931
So, we just have till the end of this week.

01:08:12.268 --> 01:08:14.602
Um, no.

01:08:14.603 --> 01:08:18.173
Y-You know what? It's...
It's gonna be just fine.

01:08:18.174 --> 01:08:20.174
(stuttering) I'm gonna take
care of this, I promise.

01:08:20.175 --> 01:08:22.444
<i>I'm gonna talk to Erica.</i>

01:08:22.444 --> 01:08:25.948
<i>We're gonna make this
work, no matter what.</i>

01:08:25.982 --> 01:08:27.649
Okay.

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:30.953
I have to go. I love you. Bye.

01:08:34.522 --> 01:08:39.993
I-I think what I'm asking for
is an advance or something.

01:08:39.995 --> 01:08:42.629
Just an advance? (chuckles)

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:44.399
Consider it done.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:46.667
(sighs)

01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:49.337
Thank you. I'm... I'm sorry.

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:53.743
- Oh, my gosh. Sorry.
- Only I ask one little thing of you.

01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.779
What is this?

01:08:59.781 --> 01:09:01.448
ERICA: Well... (chuckles)

01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:03.584
Is this like, uh...

01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:06.154
like, a solo contract?

01:09:06.154 --> 01:09:09.024
Why do you look so
surprised? You deserve it.

01:09:09.024 --> 01:09:12.526
Do you know how many artists
take years to get to this place?

01:09:12.527 --> 01:09:14.560
Some never do.

01:09:14.562 --> 01:09:16.231
But you are different.

01:09:16.232 --> 01:09:19.734
- You're special.
- Thank you.

01:09:19.734 --> 01:09:23.404
Um, that means a lot to me, Erica.

01:09:23.406 --> 01:09:25.706
But I... Just so we're on
the same page, you know?

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:29.511
My sisters are... They're the whole
reason I'm in LA to begin with.

01:09:29.511 --> 01:09:31.645
Of course they are.

01:09:31.647 --> 01:09:34.182
- And they're incredible.
- Yeah.

01:09:34.183 --> 01:09:35.582
But LA is just the starting point.

01:09:35.584 --> 01:09:39.020
Where you go from here, that's up to you.

01:09:39.054 --> 01:09:41.255
Let me turn you into an icon.

01:09:41.256 --> 01:09:44.158
An icon is not one of four.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.826
It's
one-of-a-kind.

01:09:45.827 --> 01:09:47.594
Then you'll support your whole family,

01:09:47.595 --> 01:09:50.731
not just this moment, for
the rest of their lives.

01:09:50.732 --> 01:09:52.734
Do you get that?

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:55.271
For the rest of their lives.

01:09:56.338 --> 01:09:58.772
- (laughing)
- ERICA: Oh, I want this for you.

01:09:58.773 --> 01:10:00.642
I really do.

01:10:00.643 --> 01:10:04.478
But you have to really
want it for yourself.

01:10:04.479 --> 01:10:09.551
Otherwise, you would leave me
no choice but to replace you.

01:10:09.585 --> 01:10:11.686
But anyone can be Jem.

01:10:11.687 --> 01:10:13.353
Remember?

01:10:13.354 --> 01:10:16.223
Nobody knows who she is.

01:10:16.224 --> 01:10:22.596
And Starlight owns the
name, the logo, the costumes.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:25.165
(sighs) So, you wouldn't
just be losing the house.

01:10:25.166 --> 01:10:27.869
You would lose everything
that we built together.

01:10:27.870 --> 01:10:31.773
- You don't wanna do that.
- Right.

01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:34.709
It's exciting.

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.378
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:10:37.379 --> 01:10:41.016
- ERICA: Bye. See you later.
- Bye.

01:11:02.737 --> 01:11:05.206
(muffled cheering)

01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:11.913
(muffled chattering)

01:11:11.914 --> 01:11:15.283
ERICA: Okay, listen. I know
it's probably very difficult

01:11:15.284 --> 01:11:17.718
trying to break this news to the girls.

01:11:17.719 --> 01:11:21.655
But now that you are officially
Starlight's newest solo act,

01:11:21.656 --> 01:11:24.691
you rely on me for those
types of phone calls, you know?

01:11:24.692 --> 01:11:27.262
- Let me lift the burden for you.
- Yeah.

01:11:27.263 --> 01:11:30.932
You just sort of let it go.

01:11:30.933 --> 01:11:33.834
Put that game face on and just shine.

01:11:33.835 --> 01:11:36.271
Have a great show.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:43.178
(gasps)

01:11:43.179 --> 01:11:44.878
We were just talking about you.

01:11:44.879 --> 01:11:47.182
Yeah, we know. We heard everything.

01:11:47.183 --> 01:11:50.185
Wait. Let me... Let me explain
what's been going on, okay?

01:11:50.186 --> 01:11:52.719
Explain what? What are you gonna explain?

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.856
- That you wanna go solo?
- (trembling) I tried to tell you guys,

01:11:54.857 --> 01:11:57.792
but we were gonna lose the house,
and I thought I could take care of it,

01:11:57.793 --> 01:12:01.462
- so we could always be together as a family.
- No! No.

01:12:01.463 --> 01:12:03.463
You do not get to do that.

01:12:03.464 --> 01:12:05.633
You cannot use us as an excuse for lying.

01:12:05.634 --> 01:12:07.602
That's not how a family
is supposed to work.

01:12:07.603 --> 01:12:11.338
This whole band, we've supported you.

01:12:11.339 --> 01:12:13.473
So you don't want us around anymore?

01:12:13.474 --> 01:12:16.878
You could've respected us
enough to tell us to our face.

01:12:16.879 --> 01:12:21.683
I've had it. I'm done.

01:12:21.717 --> 01:12:24.218
Me too.

01:12:24.219 --> 01:12:27.288
Wait, Kimber. Can you just...
just please try and understand?

01:12:27.289 --> 01:12:28.789
Please don't do that.
Please don't do that, J.

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:31.625
Listen, I don't need
you to take care of me.

01:12:31.626 --> 01:12:33.527
I'm not some little girl anymore.

01:12:33.528 --> 01:12:35.797

01:20:42.384 --> 01:20:45.119
Otherwise, why would he give
you Synergy as his final gift?

01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:48.557
No, I mean, the last thing
that he gave me was...

01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:53.728

I'd struggled with my ideas of beauty.

I didn't know what this was.

01:46:03.937 --> 01:46:07.440
But all I saw was this lady with pink
hair and star earrings. And I was like...

01:46:07.441 --> 01:46:12.578
Wow! Like, these girls are badass and
they just made a very big impression on me.

01:46:12.579 --> 01:46:17.415
I can't really sing or
dance very well, but...

01:46:17.416 --> 01:46:22.021
She basically taught me that it's okay
to be who you are and not to be afraid.

01:46:22.022 --> 01:46:24.389
I'm not invisible. That I have a voice

01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:27.927
and that I should express what I
feel every time I get the moment.

dropped us from the label.

Said that you wanted to...

01:50:59.933 --> 01:51:01.967

Geez, Roxy. You know,
I can't even remember.

01:51:06.238 --> 01:51:10.875
Didn't she say she could just, uh,
replace us with some other band?

How'd that work out for ya? (chuckles)

01:51:13.679 --> 01:51:18.683
