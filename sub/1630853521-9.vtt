that saw the defendant
drug eden's drink.

regular customer, franklin.

for about a year.

reminding myself that he,

-you know.
-You didn't see him
drug your drink?

distracted when there are
boobs on stage.

you and franklin
watching adrianna?

07:38.191 --> 07:39.658
Yeah, she saw it happen.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.244
By the time she got off stage,
I already drank most of it,

07:42.296 --> 07:45.413
so she took me to the back
of the dressing room
to take care of me.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.915
And made sure that
franklin stayed distracted

07:46.967 --> 07:48.416

until the cops came.

but they're never
really watching.

07:59.045 --> 08:02.097
relationship with franklin
outside the club?

08:02.149 --> 08:03.565
No, no.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.433
He doesn't even
know my real name.

I like to imagine I'm draining
my customers of their souls.

08:19.283 --> 08:21.283
-Wow, that's so depraved.
-[chuckles softly]

08:21.335 --> 08:23.418
and inspiring. [chuckles]

08:23.453 --> 08:26.404
one time, I made
a succubus the big bad
of my d&d campaign.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.406
-Shut up, I love d&d.
-[cellphone vibrates]

08:28.425 --> 08:29.508
[teddy] you're kidding.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.092
-[eden] are you on discord?
-[teddy] but, of course.

08:31.128 --> 08:32.911
I host my own rpg server.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.212
-Stud of the tavern.
-[teddy laughs]

08:34.247 --> 08:36.915
[whispering] oh, bailey,
you're so scrumptious.

08:36.934 --> 08:40.385
[chuckles] I promise, I will
find someone to relieve
your post by lunch.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.304
It's no trouble, really.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.722
I don't have court till later,

08:43.757 --> 08:45.807
and she seems
to be enjoying herself.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.258
[bailey coos]

08:47.277 --> 08:48.643
oh, no, let me get that.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.811
Stand down, your honor.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.230
Bottle washing is
well within my capabilities.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.365
Lola, I need to talk to you.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.400
-Sherri, you are
really slacking today.
-I'm sorry.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.069
Your husband
tipped off the feds
about my search warrant.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.955
That's six months of work,
down the drain.

08:59.990 --> 09:01.606
-They shut it down.
-He did what?

09:01.625 --> 09:03.441
-Did you tell him about it?
-Of course, not.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.160
I can't believe you're even
asking me that.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.913
-[mark] wow.
-Hey.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.464
I've been helping out
the surveillance team

09:09.499 --> 09:10.916
at the brandon paige house
for months.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.467
Were you eavesdropping
on us earlier?

09:12.502 --> 09:14.336
I was in the vicinity
of the conversation.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.837
That's not
technically eavesdropping.

09:15.872 --> 09:17.172
Robin taylor.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.289
I didn't mean to hear it.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.774
But I felt duty-bound
to report--

09:19.810 --> 09:21.292
-judge carmichael needs
to be in court.
-[mark] are there

09:21.311 --> 09:22.794
any other events in my life
you'd like to implode, robin?

09:22.813 --> 09:24.062
Come on, man,
it's not personal.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.181
-Okay, hey.
-Judge carmichael needs
to be in court now.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.399
Your catfight can wait.

09:28.051 --> 09:30.018
-Yeah.
-[bailey coos]

09:30.070 --> 09:32.487
this conversation
is far from over.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.869
Hey. You were right.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.005
My client, gloria,
is no longer in juvie.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.373
She has agreed to testify
against brandon paige

09:52.392 --> 09:54.092
so the feds are holding her
in protective custody.

09:54.144 --> 09:55.760
I had targeted her
as my main witness.

09:57.213 --> 09:58.096
[sighs]

09:58.548 --> 10:00.265
you know,

10:00.317 --> 10:04.052
she has a younger sister
who was also wrapped up
in the brandon paige scene.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.321
-Maddy hernandez.
-You think you can
convince her to talk to us?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.106
I'm not sure.

10:08.158 --> 10:10.692
Honestly, she's not my client
and I'm not her babysitter.

10:10.727 --> 10:12.193
What happened
to, "miss holistic law?"

10:12.228 --> 10:15.614
I promised gloria that I would
help keep maddy safe,

10:15.666 --> 10:18.232
and believe me, I have tried,
but this is
turning into something

10:18.251 --> 10:20.452
that is way beyond
the scope of my practice.

10:20.504 --> 10:22.120
As long as maddy
is roaming the streets,

10:22.172 --> 10:23.905
she's within
brandon paige's reach.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.757
You can help protect her,
she trusts you.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.292
Trust is a big word, okay?

10:27.344 --> 10:28.760
She doesn't even want my help

10:28.795 --> 10:31.129
and I guarantee you,
she would choose brandon paige
over me right now.

10:31.181 --> 10:33.748
-You underestimate the power
of the lopez charm.
-Okay.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.584
-We both know flattery is not
my strongest motivator.
-Right.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.803
But helping people is.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.756
Maddy needs your help,
I need your help.

10:41.775 --> 10:45.143
-This case needs--
-okay, just, please, stop.

10:48.849 --> 10:49.864
You're driving.

10:52.435 --> 10:54.268
Dr. Goodwin,
what is your occupation?

10:54.287 --> 10:55.954
I'm a criminologist

10:55.989 --> 10:59.624
employed by the los angeles
police department's technical
investigation division.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.326
What do you know about
the drug called ketamine?

11:01.378 --> 11:03.294
[dr. Goodwin] ketamine
is an anesthetic drug.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.747
It can have an effect
similar to alcohol,

11:05.782 --> 11:08.800
but in larger does,
it can cause a loss of memory,

11:08.835 --> 11:11.469
loss of body control,
even a loss of consciousness.

11:11.505 --> 11:15.090
Did any of the samples
you tested for this matter
show the presence of ketamine?

11:15.125 --> 11:18.626
Yes, the sample
of the blood taken
from ms. Porter, "item 1,"

11:18.645 --> 11:22.013
and sample of the beverage
taken at the scene, "item 3."

11:22.065 --> 11:25.016
was the amount present
in ms. Porter's blood
of any significance?

11:25.052 --> 11:29.637
Well, it was higher than
is typically seen
in a recreational user.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.190
How can ketamine
be used non-recreationally?

11:32.242 --> 11:34.109
It can be administered
to an individual

11:34.144 --> 11:36.327
through a system
that's commonly
referred to as, "date rape."

11:36.363 --> 11:39.197
objection,
lack of foundation, outside
the witness' expertise.

11:39.249 --> 11:40.165
Overruled.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.332
[teddy] no further questions.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.501
Mr. Watkins, your witness.

11:43.537 --> 11:47.155
You said that ketamine
can be used recreationally.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.324
That means that people
take it on purpose, right?

11:50.343 --> 11:53.344
Well, it can sometimes
be considered a party drug.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.879
You mentioned that you
detected ketamine

11:54.931 --> 11:57.348
in the complaining
witness' blood sample.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.834
-Can you determine
how it got there?
-No, I cannot.

11:59.853 --> 12:03.337
You also mentioned that you
detected ketamine
in the drink at the scene.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.640
-Can you determine
how it got there?
-I can't do that either.

12:05.675 --> 12:08.977
And, finally, in the materials
collected from mr. Hastings,

12:09.012 --> 12:12.697
there were no traces
of ketamine detected
at all, correct?

12:12.733 --> 12:13.898
That's also correct.

12:14.701 --> 12:15.650
No further questions.

12:22.209 --> 12:25.076
Psst, doughnuts
in the judge's lounge,
you didn't hear it from me.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.078
Oh, would you sign
this document first?

12:30.717 --> 12:31.883
[keyboard clacking]

12:31.918 --> 12:32.967
[lola] hmm.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.838
-I thought your parents
lived in marin county.
-They do.

12:36.873 --> 12:39.373
What's the lindon community?

12:39.392 --> 12:41.926
Uh, is there a reason
why you're snooping
through my personal mail?

12:41.978 --> 12:43.845
I didn't snoop, I glanced.

12:45.649 --> 12:47.048
It's a mobile home community.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.000
But, more importantly,

12:49.035 --> 12:52.604
[whispering] moses has been
writing across transcripts
in gel pens.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.742
[lola] moses.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.144
Yes, madam justice?

12:59.179 --> 13:01.446
Is there a reason
you've been making comments
in the transcripts.

13:01.498 --> 13:03.281
I need an outlet
for my opinions.

13:03.333 --> 13:05.566
Does that say, "this is suss"?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.401
It was suss.

13:07.420 --> 13:11.089
[gasps] and while we're
interested in my opinions,

13:11.124 --> 13:13.625
-you should really
be giving bailey--
-oh, mmm-mmm.

13:13.677 --> 13:14.893
I'm going to stop you
right there.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.261
Mmm-hmm. Mmm, mmm-hmm.

13:21.751 --> 13:24.886
You know, it's been forever
since we've had the chance
to actually talk.

13:24.921 --> 13:26.471
-Aren't you getting married?
-Allegedly.

13:26.523 --> 13:28.422
Amy's divorce
is still processing.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.758
-Have you met
rrsbd?
-Not yet.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.610
-It's really weird, right?
-Right?

13:32.646 --> 13:34.262
Yes, it is weird, thank you.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.281
I thought
s ei sensitive.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.766
I me, if the guy
is still important to her
and there's no bad blood,

13:38.785 --> 13:39.984
I don't know why
she's hiding him from me.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.119
Something I'd look into.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.287
I'm working on it.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.454
How are things
between you and luke?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.673
There are no things, you know,
we're just friends.

13:45.675 --> 13:46.674
We're in a really
odceigow

13:46.710 --> 13:48.209
there aand I'm just glad know,
that he's still in mds.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.344
All right.

13:49.379 --> 13:50.828
Maddy, hey.

13:50.847 --> 13:51.846
[friend] who is that?

13:51.882 --> 13:53.515
I got to go.

13:53.550 --> 13:54.799
You can't be here.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.467
Why are you
still harassing me?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.668
He could be watching us.

13:57.687 --> 14:00.021
Hey, hey, our agreement was
that you were going to stop

14:00.056 --> 14:01.389
hanging out
with brandon paige.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.891
Not him. Sykes.

14:04.027 --> 14:05.610
-You have to go.
-Wait, wait.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.897
Maddy, this is mark callan,
he's a prosecutor,
he might be able to help you.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.733
If you tell him what you know
about brandon paige

14:11.785 --> 14:13.484
they will make sure
you're protected.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.821
I'm sorry,
I can't talk to anybody.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.072
Leave me alone.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.879
[teddy and eden laughing]

14:24.915 --> 14:26.881
one time, I ran out of arrows,

14:26.917 --> 14:28.917
so I beat an orc to death
with my bow.

14:30.554 --> 14:33.338
Once, I had a bard character
whose weapon
of choice was a lute

14:33.373 --> 14:35.173
with knives
sticking out of its neck.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.008
Sounds like you played
some pretty killer tune.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.092
[teddy laughs, snorts]

14:38.144 --> 14:40.845
um, hey, teddy, can I just
talk to you for a second?

14:43.099 --> 14:44.849
Sorry. Sorry. [chuckles]

14:49.906 --> 14:52.890
I think you may be
getting a little distracted
from the task at hand.

14:52.909 --> 14:55.860
Nonsense, eden's just
an incredibly delightful
and engaging person.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.412
Who is counting on you
to get a conviction

14:57.447 --> 15:00.248
on a crime that
thousands of other men
have gotten away with.

15:00.283 --> 15:03.567
An assault was prevented,
and there's still evidence,
that is rare.

15:03.587 --> 15:05.370
I'm aware.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.872
If you win, you can prove that
someone doesn't have to get
hurt for there to be justice.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.407
I know what I'm doing.

15:09.426 --> 15:10.541
I'm the attorney here.

15:15.098 --> 15:16.214
[sighs]

15:17.634 --> 15:20.084
how did mr. Hastings approach
you the night of the incident?

15:20.103 --> 15:23.754
He told me he'd like
to purchase an hour with me
in the vip room

15:23.773 --> 15:25.773
but that he wanted
to grab a drink first.

15:25.809 --> 15:27.775
He didn't know
that I was recently sober

15:27.811 --> 15:31.646
so I ordered a mocktail,
drank most of it.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.432
When I started to feel hazy,
I knew that something
was wrong.

15:34.451 --> 15:38.069
Has mr. Hastings ever
expressed wanting more than
the standard lap dance?

15:38.104 --> 15:40.488
He's asked me to have sex
with him more than once.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.490
-[hastings clears throat]
-[eden] even offering payment
a few times,

15:42.542 --> 15:44.459
but that's common in the club.

15:44.494 --> 15:45.960
[teddy] no further questions.

15:45.996 --> 15:47.395
Mr. Watkins, your witness.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.031
Mr. Porter, have you eed   recs
to get through a shift?

15:51.017 --> 15:51.950
Um...

15:53.737 --> 15:54.736
Yes, I have.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.870
In fact, you've been to rehab

15:55.905 --> 15:57.538
for the abuse
of recreational drugs,
haven't you?

15:57.574 --> 15:59.190
Objection, improper
character evidence.

15:59.209 --> 16:01.876
Your honor,
the witness testifying
that she's recently sober

16:01.911 --> 16:04.078
opened the door for evidence
of her drug history.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.497
He's correct, mr. Biswas,
the door was opened.

16:06.549 --> 16:07.915
Overruled.

16:07.950 --> 16:10.084
Ms. Porter, you may
answer the question.

16:10.119 --> 16:13.137
But I was clean at the time
that I was drugged.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.307
-How is this relevant?
-Ms. Porter, please,
answer yes or no.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.112
Yes.

16:21.164 --> 16:22.897
Wasn't ketamine one
of the drugs you were
admitted to rehab for?

16:22.916 --> 16:26.084
He's acting like I'm
some drugged out stripper.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.036
It was a part phase.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.704
Have you ever
blacked out at work

16:29.739 --> 16:32.056
after taking recreational
drugs of your own volition?

16:32.091 --> 16:34.776
Objection, your honor,rele,
argumentative, I can go on.

16:34.811 --> 16:37.145
-Mr. Biswas.
-Mr. Watkins
is knowingly playing

16:37.197 --> 16:38.980
into tasteless stereotypes
of exotic dancers

16:39.032 --> 16:41.899
that in no way describe
the remarkable woman
that eden is.

16:43.953 --> 16:45.119
[people whispering]

16:45.155 --> 16:49.590
I , msrt

16:49.625 --> 16:52.010
I think this will be
a great time

16:52.062 --> 16:54.795
to take our evening recess,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.931
We will see you back here
tomorrow morning.

16:56.966 --> 16:58.166
And, mr. Biswas,

16:59.919 --> 17:01.586
a word in my chambers, please.

17:07.310 --> 17:08.276
[door closes]

17:08.311 --> 17:09.644
hey.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.046
-We cannot do this right now.
-Relax, I'm just
picking up bailey.

17:12.082 --> 17:14.232
I have an attorney on his way
back to my chambers,

17:14.267 --> 17:16.600
so my double-crossing husband
better find a way to disappear

17:16.619 --> 17:18.986

seems to think so.

you keep telling off your man.

17:24.994 --> 17:26.961

17:37.223 --> 17:38.840
We'll finish this discussion
at home.

17:40.877 --> 17:41.843
[moses] come in.

17:43.012 --> 17:43.845
[lola] hmm.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.682
[bailey coos]

17:51.855 --> 17:52.854
[moses] bye, bailey.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.440
Mr. Biswas, I just wanted
to check in with you.

17:55.475 --> 17:59.527
As a former dda myself,
who shares your
empathetic nature.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.196
I can understand
how defining the boundary

18:02.248 --> 18:04.766
between victim and client
can be challenging.

18:04.801 --> 18:06.617
-She thinks you have the hots
for the stripper.
-Moses!

18:06.652 --> 18:08.652
What? No, of course, not.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.038
What you saw in court
was passion not lust.

18:11.073 --> 18:14.759
Mr. Biswas, in the interest
of a fair trial,you abl?

18:14.794 --> 18:17.762
Yes, your honor, I will
one hundred percent monitor
myself from here on out.

18:17.797 --> 18:18.846
Glad to hear it.

You may go.

to make that donation
to your daughter's school...

18:28.942 --> 18:30.558
Hey, boss.

18:30.577 --> 18:33.227
I got a grant of immunity
for you to sign
for maddy hernandez.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.395
Why, she agree to testify?

18:34.414 --> 18:36.197
Not yet, she's scared to talk.

18:36.232 --> 18:37.949
An offer for
witness protection
might convince her.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.368
That's the plan, if the feds
don't get to her first.

18:40.403 --> 18:42.570
They already have her sister,
gloria, in protective custody.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.055
Well, then you
better be faster.

Right, I just, I'm, I'm...

Adrianna just texted me.

She's out, she was
just here this morning,
I don't know what happened.

18:51.747 --> 18:54.248
-What? She's our
only eye witness.
-Exactly. We're doomed.

-Oh, yeah, drink plans.

[emily] yeah.

19:02.425 --> 19:04.475
-You're bailing?
-No.

19:04.527 --> 19:05.560
I'm not.

19:05.595 --> 19:09.147
We are just going to kill
two birds with one stone.

-I can't believe I let you
convince me to come here.
-Oh, we--

19:25.465 --> 19:27.165
all right, right, ladies,
listen up.

19:27.217 --> 19:29.484
Consent is
the name of the game,
so ask before you touch.

19:29.536 --> 19:32.620
And do not set tip rail
unless you're
nd flying.

19:32.655 --> 19:36.090
No less than $10 per dancer
according the stripper forum
I studied.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.126
Now, I'm going
to go grab a stack.

19:39.829 --> 19:40.912

Hey, teddy.

19:47.203 --> 19:48.252
Teddy.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.307
I'll just go
talk to her myself.

19:53.343 --> 19:55.960
-Get... Stop. Get off me.
-What? Sara.

19:55.979 --> 19:57.061

Adrianna, hey.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.279
What are you doing here?

20:15.314 --> 20:17.164
You can't just show up
and drop my real name
like that.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.332
What happened?

20:18.368 --> 20:19.967
I mean, you were so committed
to putting franklin away,

20:20.003 --> 20:21.151
and now, you're out,
just like that?

20:21.170 --> 20:23.037
I love eden
but I need this job.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.622
Vince fired her this morning.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.540
What?

20:25.592 --> 20:26.674
Wait, who's vince.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.543
Shh, it's our manager.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.927
He texted all the girls

20:29.963 --> 20:32.213
that if any of us showed up
at that courthouse,
that we're next.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.131
Turns out, he's the witness
for the defense.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.299
He's testifying tomorrow.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.134
What if I get you a job
at a new club?

20:37.169 --> 20:38.135
Money's good here.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.304
And other clubs are worse,
believe it or not.

20:40.339 --> 20:43.307
I'd rather take
my chances getting
drugged than trafficked.

20:43.342 --> 20:45.009
So if you'll excuse me.

20:45.028 --> 20:47.344
Your word is the only thing
to help put franklin away.

20:47.363 --> 20:49.146

to a jury.

Sex workers report crimes
all the time
that pick up dust.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.385
You know why?
Because no one cares about us.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.921
And I was so stupid
to think that e
could be different.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.757
Hey, you won't know
if it could be different
unless you try.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.544
Look, I'm at work.

21:03.579 --> 21:05.263

[teddy] thank you.

capture the register.

from your parents seemed
to ruffle your feathers.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.974
My feathers
do not get ruffled,
thank you very much.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.144
I could've completely
misread the situation.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.681
Specially, considering
the postcard didn't have
a whole lot to say.

I really don't want to--

22:36.906 --> 22:37.988
I'm listening.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.441
Yeah. Um.

22:42.144 --> 22:45.196
I don't hear from my parents
very often,

22:45.248 --> 22:47.365
so when I do,
it usually means something.

22:47.417 --> 22:49.500
And you don't know
if that something
is good or bad.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.501
Mmm-mmm.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.152
Why don't you call them
and find out?

22:52.171 --> 22:53.537
That's complicated.

22:54.657 --> 22:56.173
They're not easy
to track down.

22:56.926 --> 22:58.509

it's near impossible to visit

27:02.305 --> 27:03.504
So you know what to do.

27:09.895 --> 27:10.928
[sighs]

27:12.214 --> 27:13.897
jesus, teddy,
you scared the hell out of me.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.183
Thank god, you're here.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.602
-Is everything all right?
-I don't know,
I need you to see this.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.857
What am I watching here?

27:23.892 --> 27:26.744
I found out they didn't
disclose security footage
from the private vip rooms,

27:26.796 --> 27:29.246
so scrubbed through
a few weeks of it off a hunch.

27:30.800 --> 27:31.915
[mark] turn that off.

27:31.968 --> 27:34.534
This wasn't the first time
franklin drugged eden.

27:34.553 --> 27:38.872
He sexually assaulted her
not once, not twice,
but three times, at least.

27:38.891 --> 27:39.757
[softly] shit.

27:39.809 --> 27:41.592
I don't know what to do.

27:41.644 --> 27:42.709
What the hell do we do?

27:42.728 --> 27:44.345
The only decent thing
we can do.

27:45.765 --> 27:46.897
We tell her.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.512
Oh, my god.

28:01.564 --> 28:03.514
Wait, did you sleep here?

28:03.566 --> 28:05.132
I wish, I couldn't
get comfortable.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.267
Yeah, mark filled me in,
it's horrible.

28:07.302 --> 28:09.636
It got worse.
The manager, vince, knew.

28:09.655 --> 28:10.554
Look.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.673
[inaudible]

28:13.693 --> 28:14.608
[teddy sighs]

28:15.728 --> 28:17.227
[inaudible]

28:17.279 --> 28:19.229
oh, this is
absolutely disgusting.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.015
Look alive, maddy's willing
to talk about brandon paige.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.867
She's on her way up now,
I need you to take notes.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.487
[teddy] I can't,
not right now.

28:27.123 --> 28:28.489
Look, I know it's tough,

28:28.524 --> 28:30.690
you can afford to give eden
a few more moments
of ignorant bliss,

28:30.710 --> 28:31.959
I'm not your secretary.

28:31.994 --> 28:34.328
Do you expect me
to put a senior dda on this,
to take notes?

28:34.363 --> 28:35.529
This is your job, teddy.

28:35.548 --> 28:36.914
Why don't you let teddy
just sit this one out?

28:36.966 --> 28:40.167
We deal with
unspeakable crimes in this
office on a daily basis.

28:40.202 --> 28:42.753
We put our emotions aside
and do the work.

28:42.788 --> 28:43.804
Build that habit today.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.223
Okay.

28:49.729 --> 28:50.761
[whispers] hi.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.987
Brandon would challenge
a group of kids to rob a store
and they'd swarm it.

29:00.889 --> 29:01.939
I never went with them.

29:02.558 --> 29:04.691
Neither did brandon.

29:04.726 --> 29:07.111
They'd bring all the stuff
back and store it
on the attic in his house.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.197
-We have what we need.
-Go ahead and arrest them.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.535
Maddy, we know
that speaking out
against brandon is scary

29:14.570 --> 29:17.037
but in witness protection,
he can't get to you, okay,
you'll be safe.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.707
How do you feel?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.093
I'm worried.

29:23.129 --> 29:24.261
I know.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.345
But you did good.

29:25.914 --> 29:27.080
Okay?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.182
Now, listen.

29:29.602 --> 29:33.270
I gave gloria my word
that I would look out for you,

29:33.305 --> 29:35.556
I intend to keep
my promise, okay?

29:36.976 --> 29:38.108
You ready to go?

29:38.144 --> 29:39.193
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.985
Teddy, I need you
to change the witness name
on the warrant

29:48.020 --> 29:49.119
from gloria to maddy, okay?

29:49.155 --> 29:50.404
Yeah, of course.

29:59.765 --> 30:02.332
Peace and quiet,
who knew it was possible?

30:02.384 --> 30:03.300
[chuckles]

30:03.335 --> 30:05.752
-sherri.
-Yes, your honor.

30:05.787 --> 30:07.754
It's okay to not be okay.

30:08.957 --> 30:10.007
Thank you.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.726
[sherri grunts softly]

30:16.565 --> 30:18.182
I think something is wrong.

30:18.800 --> 30:19.799
What can I do?

30:19.819 --> 30:24.137
I think I need to go see
if my parents are okay.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.240
Because I won't know
that they're okay until I do.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.859
But there's
so much to do here.

30:28.911 --> 30:31.161
That is for me to worry about.

30:31.813 --> 30:34.031
Family first, always.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.783
Take as much time as you need
to handle everything, okay?

30:37.503 --> 30:38.535
Okay.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.288
But that means
I need to leave now.

30:47.930 --> 30:49.129
[exhales deeply]

30:52.501 --> 30:53.634
[softly] okay.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.519
Okay.

30:55.938 --> 30:56.937
Okay.

30:59.508 --> 31:02.526
[teddy] we found footage
of mr. Hastings

31:03.845 --> 31:06.897
sexually assaulting you
in the private vip rooms.

31:06.949 --> 31:08.198
What does that mean?

31:08.734 --> 31:10.117
How far did he go?

31:10.736 --> 31:11.735
I...

31:12.071 --> 31:13.203
He, uh...

31:13.906 --> 31:16.039
It was digital penetration.

31:20.028 --> 31:22.746
How would I not notice?

31:22.798 --> 31:27.000
[sara] it's likely you were
drugged during
those occasions as well.

31:31.774 --> 31:33.390
What am I
supposed to do with that?

31:33.409 --> 31:34.825
[teddy] you don'havetoytng.

31:34.860 --> 31:37.160
My office will pursue
more serious charges

31:37.195 --> 31:39.696
we can get a bigger sentence
and a sex
offender registration,

31:39.715 --> 31:41.131
■ñ■ñ
-in addition
to the drug charges, we--
-no.

31:42.051 --> 31:43.000
[sara] what do you mean?

31:43.035 --> 31:45.385
I don't want
to go to another trial.

31:45.421 --> 31:46.520
I don't want to go back
on the stand,

31:46.522 --> 31:48.155
have all this information
be made publ

31:48.207 --> 31:49.723
[teddy] we can put this guy
away for years.

31:49.758 --> 31:50.774
[sobs]

31:51.643 --> 31:52.859
[inhales loudly]

31:52.912 --> 31:54.278
I just want this all
to be over.

31:54.846 --> 31:55.946
I'm not doing it.

31:56.815 --> 31:57.698
Any of it.

32:00.169 --> 32:01.134
[door opens]

32:02.221 --> 32:03.437
[door closes]

32:09.995 --> 32:11.328
[elevator bell dings]

32:12.481 --> 32:14.348
[crying softly]

32:14.383 --> 32:15.782
[footsteps approaching]

32:24.176 --> 32:26.209
can't shake the feeling
that I signed up for this.

32:26.244 --> 32:28.445
You signed up
to sell a fantasy.

32:28.464 --> 32:31.715
What he stole from you
was not for sale.

32:32.835 --> 32:34.952
I just feel so powerless.

32:36.121 --> 32:39.373
I know there's power
in pushing forward
with the case.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.659
What if it destroys me?

32:42.711 --> 32:45.579
Well, it's not justice
if we lose you in the process.

32:45.614 --> 32:47.581
Protecting yourself
is what's most important.

32:49.117 --> 32:51.468
I just don't want
to disappoint anyone.

32:52.621 --> 32:54.454
[women talking indistinctly]

32:54.473 --> 32:55.973
well, looks like you haven't.

33:03.465 --> 33:05.131
Won't vince fire you guys
for being here?

33:05.150 --> 33:06.299
Fuck vince.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.152
We are standing with you
and whatever you decide to do.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.354
-[sighs]
-[woman 1] yeah, girl.

33:10.406 --> 33:11.655
-[woman 2] that's right.
-[woman 3] we got you.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.140
I just threw in
to the deep end
with this case, teddy,

33:14.159 --> 33:15.192
but you did a great job.

33:15.244 --> 33:16.777
It doesn't feel like it.

33:16.812 --> 33:20.163
Offering a deal seems wrong,
we can peg franklin
for much worse.

33:20.199 --> 33:23.116
When we have a chance
to honor victim's wishes,
we do it.

33:23.151 --> 33:24.584
And this is how she
wanted to move on.

33:25.987 --> 33:27.320
Good morning, your honor.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.624
The preliminary hearing
in the brandon paige case
was sent here.

33:30.659 --> 33:31.875
What time would
you like to call the case?

33:31.927 --> 33:33.827
Counsellor, I'm impressed
by how quickly

33:33.846 --> 33:35.962
you were able
to push this case through.

33:35.997 --> 33:38.682
I have trial here until,
at least, this afternoon.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.017
Then I'll wait, thank you.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.638
Tell me where
the defense witnesses sit.

33:44.673 --> 33:46.023
Figure it out.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.391
[luke] I'll take it
to my client.

33:55.200 --> 33:58.618
The people have footage
of you sexually
assaulting eden.

34:00.021 --> 34:01.187
-Three times.
-They're lying.

34:01.206 --> 34:02.539
It's you plain as day.

34:03.459 --> 34:05.208
They're offering a deal.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.494
Prison time
with no sex registration.

34:07.529 --> 34:09.362
No deal, we can win them over.
Bring on the jury.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.048
If you don't take this deal
the prosecution
will charge you

34:11.083 --> 34:12.532
with multiple sex crimes,

34:12.551 --> 34:14.334
and you'll almost certainly
lose at trial,

34:14.369 --> 34:16.870
and get more time
than the offer.

34:16.889 --> 34:20.841
My advice is to take the deal
'cause it's less time
than you...

34:22.061 --> 34:23.226
[whispers] than you deserve.

34:25.714 --> 34:26.763
Okay.

34:29.818 --> 34:31.318
Yeah, I'll take the deal.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.411
[indistinct chattering]

34:42.331 --> 34:44.698
so, oh, come on,
we did the best we could.

34:44.733 --> 34:46.950
You have to be
okay with that, seriously.

34:47.002 --> 34:48.418
Oh, my god, sara.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.003
-What?
-Can we ask you something?

34:54.676 --> 34:55.625
Hey.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.712
It's done?

34:58.747 --> 34:59.880
It's done.

35:02.751 --> 35:04.267
Thought it would
feel better than this.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.419
Yeah, it's only day one.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.437
Give it time.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.226
Thank you for everything.

35:13.261 --> 35:15.762
Why did you want us
to meet you outside, anyway?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.314
Figured you earned a show.

35:17.366 --> 35:19.098
[vince] come on, now,
you got to be kidding.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.267
[policeman] anything you say
can and will...

35:21.286 --> 35:23.403
Oh, my god. [laughs]

35:24.039 --> 35:25.155
wait.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.908
[indistinct chattering]

35:27.943 --> 35:29.543
that's great. Oh, great.

35:29.995 --> 35:31.328
You did this?

35:31.380 --> 35:33.964
I handed lapd the footage
of vince taking payment
from franklin,

35:33.999 --> 35:35.966
and that threatening text
he sent the dancers.

35:36.001 --> 35:38.885
He's being charged
with conspiracy
to commit sexual battery.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.227
Shedemon327.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.181
-Excuse me?
-My discord user.

35:51.233 --> 35:53.517
Now that the trial is over,
we can really be friends.

35:54.319 --> 35:55.485
Ah.

35:59.140 --> 36:00.357
Hey.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.776
I got a lawyer
in an organization
called strippers united,

36:02.811 --> 36:04.027
who wants to connect with you.

36:04.079 --> 36:06.246
Wants to help you file
and get your job back
at the club.

36:10.335 --> 36:11.785
-Let's do it.
-Awesome.

36:12.204 --> 36:13.620
Come on.

36:13.655 --> 36:16.339
First, I'm taking us
all out to celebrate.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.676
I mean, you guys almost
cleaned me out last night.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.211
-[eden laughing]
-[sara] yeah.

36:22.681 --> 36:28.334
On the record
in people v. Paige,
case ls210-c32

36:28.353 --> 36:30.520
is present and represented.

36:30.556 --> 36:31.805
The people are represented.

36:31.840 --> 36:32.889
-Counsel, state your case--
-[door opens]

36:32.941 --> 36:34.858
assistant united states
attorney, zoya hameed,

36:34.893 --> 36:36.860
on behalf
of the united states.

36:36.895 --> 36:40.146
Your honor,
I'm filing with the court,
a mission to intervene,

36:40.181 --> 36:43.016
a mission to transfer,
and a five-count
grand jury indictment

36:43.035 --> 36:44.851
just unsealed
from federal district court.

36:44.870 --> 36:48.655
We are asking this defendant
be removed to federal court
pending trial.

36:48.690 --> 36:50.023
-On what grounds?
-[zoya] the da's office

36:50.042 --> 36:51.992
is ill-equipped
to handle this case.

36:52.027 --> 36:54.411
Transferring brandon paige
into federal custody

36:54.463 --> 36:56.046
will ensure
a swifter conviction

36:56.081 --> 36:58.081
which will lead
to a much longer sentence.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.550
-What's the people's position?
-This is a community issue.

37:00.586 --> 37:03.753
If there's one thing
the los angeles district
attorney's office can handle,

37:03.805 --> 37:05.338
it's gang activity.

37:05.373 --> 37:06.723
Let us take the shot.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.984
I will rule on this matter
after a brief recess.

37:20.722 --> 37:21.938
[door opens]

37:21.974 --> 37:23.106
how diu hereo fast?

37:23.141 --> 37:26.860
Got an alert
about leftover dough
heudges lounge.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.145
I've been stuffing my face
all morning.

37:29.164 --> 37:34.000
Well, praise god for pastries,
because I need the benner
strain of brutal honesty.

37:34.036 --> 37:35.252
My best advice?

37:36.255 --> 37:38.004
Let the feds do their thing.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.874
They can pack a bigger punch
with a hefty sentence
and no parole.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.825
But the da's office
got there first.

37:42.844 --> 37:45.462
If we're going by the book,
state court should
get their first chance

37:45.497 --> 37:47.881
at a conviction
on a public offense.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.332
The feds can wait their turn.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.301
But you're forgetting
about optics.

37:51.336 --> 37:55.388
Ruling in favor
of your best friend
could appear improper

37:55.440 --> 37:57.974
and, even worse,
if he doesn't win.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.143
Do you trust mark
to get a conviction?

38:04.399 --> 38:06.149
You'll make
the right decision.

38:06.184 --> 38:07.534
You always do.
