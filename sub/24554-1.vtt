00:39.307 --> 00:40.608
It's been three months

00:40.608 --> 00:44.645
since WWN reporter Katya
Nevin was taken hostage.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.548
Although her abductors
are believed to be part

00:47.548 --> 00:49.917
of a known terrorist
organization,

00:49.917 --> 00:51.519
it's unclear what
their motives are

00:51.519 --> 00:53.721
since there has been
no contact from them,

00:53.721 --> 00:56.224
nor any ransom demands
made at this time.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.560
It's feared they
may want retribution

00:59.560 --> 01:01.629
for a damning report
Miss Nevin presented

01:01.629 --> 01:04.098
about the barbaric
nature of the terrorists

01:04.098 --> 01:07.335
during recent confrontations
in the East.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.037
- Come in.

05:05.038 --> 05:05.906
- Hi.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.143
You all right?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.078
- I'm fine.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.047
- I'm just about
to do a coffee run.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.148
You've got some time.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.451
Can I get you anything?
 No.

05:17.451 --> 05:18.318
- Thanks.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.589
No more caffeine.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.659
- It's just jitters.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.730
- Katya, no one's gonna judge
you if you don't do this.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.964
If you're not ready--

05:30.964 --> 05:31.632
- Why does everyone
keep saying that?

05:31.632 --> 05:33.534
I'm ready, okay?

05:36.570 --> 05:37.438
Look,

05:39.206 --> 05:41.575
I know you mean well.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.044
Could you just
give me some space?

05:44.044 --> 05:44.912
- Sure.

05:47.848 --> 05:48.716
- Go!

05:51.018 --> 05:51.885
Get out!

06:03.296 --> 06:05.265
- Okay, everyone,
we've cut to our cave.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.067
We are back in three.

06:10.738 --> 06:13.373
- Can we have a look at
camera three please, Steve?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.910
He's looking a
little soft to me.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.245
- Here we go, Lou.

06:18.245 --> 06:20.013
Coffee latte, one sweetener.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.115
- Sal, you're a godsend.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.484
I am dying here.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.154
- Is there anything
else I can get for you?

06:27.154 --> 06:31.024
- Do you know if the new edit
suites are installed or not?

06:31.024 --> 06:34.528
Actually, it's not
your department.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.396
Don't worry, it's fine.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.598
- No, no, no! Let me
just find out for you

06:37.598 --> 06:38.666
and I'll get back to you.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.267
- Above and beyond.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.069
I like it.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.505
Keep it up.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.106
It's working.

06:46.106 --> 06:46.974
- Thanks.

06:52.079 --> 06:52.913
- You!

06:52.913 --> 06:54.047
P.A.

06:54.047 --> 06:54.915
Yes, you!

06:58.819 --> 07:00.387
Is that my coffee?

07:00.387 --> 07:02.723
- Why didn't you say anything
when I was doing the rounds?

07:02.723 --> 07:05.192
- A good production assistant

07:05.192 --> 07:08.395
anticipates the needs
of her superiors,

07:08.395 --> 07:10.263
if she values her job.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.333
Understand?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.201
Good.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.838
Always keep the talent happy.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.508
Go on.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.476
Off you go. We're done.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.580
- I hate you so fucking much.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.817
I just wanted a coffee.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.063
Sally, what's up?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.832
- I came to ask about
the new editing suites.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.133
- Christian just texted.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.167
He's waiting in the van.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.802
Everything's under control.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.003
- Okay.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.171
- Hey, Sally.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.708
- Yeah, I'm fine.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.243
- Sally.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.045
- Just a shitty day.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.813
So unprofessional.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.750
- I'm fine.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.552
It's just one thing
after the other.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.086
How does McDonald
think it's okay

08:06.086 --> 08:09.923
to just humiliate someone
in front of the entire crew?

08:09.923 --> 08:12.392
He's such an arrogant prick.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.562
And then Katya snapped at
me and I couldn't sleep--

08:16.363 --> 08:17.631
- Nothing, she's just agitated.

08:17.631 --> 08:18.599
You know how she gets.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.000
Always an island.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.334
Alex, she's just
about to go on--

08:21.334 --> 08:22.936
- No one's an island, Sally.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.337
So come on, move out the door.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.406
- Alex, she's just
about to go on air.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.240
Shit!

08:34.782 --> 08:36.249
- Katya, it's me.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.988
Are you okay?

08:40.988 --> 08:42.422
- I'm fine.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.524
- You don't have
to pretend, Katya.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.358
Not to me.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.627
- Alex, please.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.797
I have to do this.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.364
- You said the same thing
about going to Burma.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.702
"I have to go where the
story takes me," you said.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.836
Then I almost lost you.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.237
- That's not fair.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.806
- No, it's not.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.508
But it did happen to
you, Katya. Didn't it?

09:01.508 --> 09:02.810
I just don't think you should.
 Alex!

09:02.810 --> 09:04.344
- We're not doing
this right now.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.278
- But Katya.
 No!

09:05.278 --> 09:06.714
- Alex, the decision's made.

09:06.714 --> 09:07.781
Just drop it.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.253
- Come here.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.487
It's okay.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.027
Look at me.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.396
Focus on my breath, okay?

09:28.335 --> 09:29.770
That's it.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.404
That's it, breathe.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.978
- What you still
doing with me, Alex?

09:37.978 --> 09:38.946
I'm broken.

09:40.047 --> 09:43.516
- I'm putting the
pieces back together.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.019
- You don't have to
feel responsible for me.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.458
We are a family, Katya.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.826
The three of us.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.262
Til the end.

10:07.675 --> 10:11.544
Maybe, when you're ready,
it could be a ring.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.814
- Once step at a time, tiger.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.650
- I know, I know.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.185
But you know what,

10:19.152 --> 10:22.222
I'll wait as long as I have to.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.727
Oh, it's Chris.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.161
I'm so sorry, I have to go.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.429
- Okay.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.363
Come see me after the
broadcast, all right?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.732
I'll take you for a coffee.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.033
- Yeah.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.401
Love you.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.578
- Come on! Come on!

10:47.047 --> 10:47.915
Shit!

11:11.204 --> 11:13.540
- Sir, you're impeding on
a government investigation.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.242
- I just paid six
quid for that meal.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.978
Is the government
gonna pay me back?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.049
- You're a trained operative.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.817
Start acting like one.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.747
- Target is in the open
and we have lost visual.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.982
He's on foot.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.284
Last seen heading west
on central street.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.185
- I think I know
where he's going.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.486
Let's move.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.155
- I said, let's move!

12:19.739 --> 12:21.374
- Christian, I told
you a thousand times.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.343
You can't smoke here.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.513
Do you know how late you are?

12:26.513 --> 12:27.815
- Do you know how hard it is

12:27.815 --> 12:29.382
to get across this
city during rush hour?

12:29.382 --> 12:30.417
- Yes, I do.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.788
I make the same trip
every morning before nine.

12:34.788 --> 12:35.956
Not ten.

12:35.956 --> 12:36.824
Nine!

12:37.757 --> 12:39.192
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.227
- All right, I'm late.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.694
I'm always late.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.164
- Yeah and I'm getting
sick of covering for you.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.532
- Then don't!

12:45.532 --> 12:47.901
Do you think I give a
shit about this job?

12:50.537 --> 12:51.905
- I give a shit.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.707
I vouched for you, man.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.009
Every time you're late,

12:56.009 --> 12:57.710
every time you fuck around,

12:57.710 --> 13:00.213
or every time you do
stupid shit like this,

13:00.213 --> 13:02.649
it reflects badly on me.

13:02.649 --> 13:06.854
- I wouldn't want to spoil
your perfect reputation.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.091
- You know what, just drive.

13:46.826 --> 13:47.961
- Katya Nevin!

13:47.961 --> 13:49.429
Where is she?

13:50.830 --> 13:51.731
- She knows me.

13:51.731 --> 13:52.699
I'm Greg Laborde.

13:52.699 --> 13:53.967
Professor Greg Laborde.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.535
- Is everything
all right, Andrea?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.971
- Please, it's imperative I
see Miss Nevin immediately!

13:57.971 --> 13:59.372
- We have protocols, sir.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.807
If you don't have
an appointment,

14:00.807 --> 14:02.175
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.748
- Put the gun down and
give me the drive, now.

14:08.748 --> 14:12.052
Killing you won't wear on my
conscious in the slightest.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.420
- Wait.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.989
He might not have it.

14:15.989 --> 14:19.392
- Get Katya Nevin down here now!

14:19.392 --> 14:21.428
- Sally, they need Katya!

14:21.428 --> 14:23.997
- She's hitting
the silent alarm.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.465
In five minutes, this
place will be crawling

14:25.465 --> 14:27.100
with the domestics.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.536
- We can deal with domestics.

14:33.106 --> 14:36.443
- Katya, there's a
situation downstairs.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.556
- Coming up next, the
news and the weather.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.391
- With an update
on how strong winds

14:51.391 --> 14:54.827
have forced the closure of
the music festival in Datum.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.130
- Yes, the wind seems
to be influencing people

14:57.130 --> 14:59.466
in the studio at the moment.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.168
- You're on in seven minutes.

15:01.168 --> 15:04.004
- Sally, first and foremost,
I'm an investigative reporter,

15:04.004 --> 15:04.837
okay?

15:04.837 --> 15:06.139
I follow the story.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.640
- Guys, we are live.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.841
- I need to speak to Lou.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.310
- Katya!

15:10.310 --> 15:11.411
- Everyone here in the studio
in impervious to weather.

15:12.879 --> 15:16.716
Well, it looks as if they're
getting a bit wet to me.

15:16.716 --> 15:17.917
- Why are you always to eager

15:17.917 --> 15:19.352
to put yourself at risk, Katya?

15:22.122 --> 15:24.824
Look, this is a story, Sally.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.326
My story.

15:26.326 --> 15:30.030
- No one has ever accused
you of being a wet blanket.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.966
- That's just where she's been
trying to get me for years.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.901
Under those blankets,
but there's no chance.

15:34.901 --> 15:38.938
- Guys, we are trying to
make a news program here.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.041
- Lou, there's a
lunatic downstairs,

15:41.041 --> 15:44.277
waving a gun around and
demanding Katya by name.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.145
She can't go down there.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.913
You have to tell her.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.649
- He's an old source.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.817
My first time out in the field,

15:50.817 --> 15:53.653
it was his story
that broke my career.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.522
- Theoretical biology.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.857
I remember it.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.059
Great piece.

15:59.059 --> 15:59.926
Unique.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.362
Do you know him well?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.897
- Well enough to know his is
completely out of character.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.200
He's obviously in
some kind of danger.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.801
- I'll give you half an hour.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.071
I'll dig out some
archive to run.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.572
Sally, go with her.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.773
- This is insane.

16:13.773 --> 16:14.741
I can't even believe
we're considering this.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.543
- Don't go far away.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.811
There's lots more coming
up in just a moment.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.813
- Stay with us,
we'll be right back.

16:34.927 --> 16:35.828
- Okay, we get it.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.997
You're in a hurry.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.000
- You're loving
this, aren't you?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.702
You gotta get used
to me and Katya.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.138
I'm telling you, she's the one.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.507
- Keep telling yourself.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.042
- Yeah, I've been
looking at rings.

16:49.042 --> 16:52.645
- You've been with this
chick a fucking year, Alex.

16:52.645 --> 16:56.549
- Listen, all I'm asking you
for is a little bit of support.

16:56.549 --> 16:57.984
Okay?

16:57.984 --> 16:59.986
You're the only
family I've got left.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.490
You want me to walk you
down the fucking aisle?

17:03.490 --> 17:05.092
Why don't you support yourself?

17:05.092 --> 17:06.559
That's what you're
good at anyway.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.926
- That's not fair.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.098
You've got some brass
fucking balls on you

17:11.098 --> 17:12.964
talking to me about fair.

17:12.964 --> 17:13.866
Fuck this.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.734
I'm going for a smoke.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.003
- Yeah, fuck off.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.651
Reggie?

17:31.651 --> 17:32.519
Reggie?

17:37.624 --> 17:38.491
Phillis?

17:41.494 --> 17:43.296
Reggie

18:01.448 --> 18:02.315
Reggie?

18:09.021 --> 18:09.889
Phillis?

18:40.052 --> 18:40.920
Phillis?

18:48.928 --> 18:49.762
Phillis!

18:50.663 --> 18:51.664
Phillis

19:05.845 --> 19:06.713
Chris!

19:57.364 --> 19:58.398
- No closer!

20:03.069 --> 20:04.003
- Laborde!

20:04.003 --> 20:05.772
- Katya, quickly come here.

20:05.772 --> 20:06.839
Take it!

20:06.839 --> 20:10.209
- Stand back for
your own safety.

20:11.478 --> 20:12.845
- This is the biggest
story of your career!

20:12.845 --> 20:14.046
Take it!

20:14.046 --> 20:17.617
- You're gonna wanna
give me that right now.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.354
- Sally.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.457
Go upstairs, now!

20:24.457 --> 20:25.292
- But.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.158
- Go!

21:06.533 --> 21:10.337
- I'm just a great admirer
of your work, professor.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.839
You. Where did you
send the drive?

21:12.839 --> 21:14.307
- I know my rights.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.508
I don't need to
tell you anything

21:15.508 --> 21:17.310
until you identify yourself.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.648
- Proteus, she's a civilian.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.684
- Nah.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.321
She's not a civilian.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.530
Something special.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.772
Now where did your
colleague take my drive?

21:47.840 --> 21:48.775
- Fuck you.

21:50.943 --> 21:51.878
- Let's go!

21:53.279 --> 21:54.347
Get something!

21:54.347 --> 21:55.648
- Officers.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.684
This situation is under
government jurisdiction.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.219
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:00.219 --> 22:01.954
It's a massacre out there.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.491
- Everybody needs to
just stay calm, okay?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.292
Everything's under control.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.028
Look at it!

22:09.028 --> 22:11.798
What's fucking happening, man?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.369
- All right.

22:21.608 --> 22:24.411
- What comes next needs
strength, character.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.946
You were just the
logical choice.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.180
- I'm scared.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.617
You can't
afford that luxury.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.519
What's the situation here?

22:32.519 --> 22:33.453
- Take it easy.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.554
- Please, go!

22:38.525 --> 22:39.759
- Come on.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.260
What's your end game here?

22:41.260 --> 22:42.529
Just put the gun down.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.796
- Answers, now!

22:45.732 --> 22:47.133
- You're not government.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.402
You were the inside source.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.140
Have you any idea
what you've done?

22:54.140 --> 22:56.443
- I did my duty to my people.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.679
You think your people
are safe from this?

22:59.679 --> 23:01.681
No one is safe.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.316
Safety
is just an illusion.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.618
Power. Loyalty.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.087
That's real.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.790
- Death is real.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.158
That's what's coming for us.

23:12.158 --> 23:14.894
Me, you, your benefactors.

23:14.894 --> 23:15.762
All of us.

23:36.983 --> 23:38.017
I'm infected!

24:16.355 --> 24:17.223
Shit!

24:33.372 --> 24:34.373
Ashcroft.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.241
Upstairs!

25:01.333 --> 25:02.802
Ashcroft, the ax.

25:18.918 --> 25:23.122
(reporter speaking
foreign language)

25:41.240 --> 25:44.210
- Katya, what the
hell is going on?

25:45.578 --> 25:46.445
Jesus.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.950
- Sally took it to tech.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.820
Let's just get the
weight off your feet,

25:53.820 --> 25:55.021
you poor thing.

25:55.021 --> 25:57.824
- Get off me, I can
do it on my own.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.226
- Don't worry, everyone.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.929
Everything's under control.

26:02.929 --> 26:03.796
Katya.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.304
- Look at me!

26:12.304 --> 26:14.006
Self defense, all right?

26:14.006 --> 26:16.542
You tell those fuckers,
when they question you,

26:16.542 --> 26:18.878
you had no choice.

26:18.878 --> 26:23.315
Jesus Christ, what the fuck
happened in there, man?

26:23.315 --> 26:25.017
Fuck, finger prints.

26:26.819 --> 26:28.154
- I think she was eating Reggie.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.924
Why are you laughing?

26:31.924 --> 26:33.259
- Relax, man!

26:33.259 --> 26:34.827
You're going into shock.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.395
- Yeah and why the
fuck aren't you?

26:38.097 --> 26:40.399
We need to get our
story straight before
the police arrive.

26:40.399 --> 26:43.870
- I told you the
fucking story, Chris!

26:43.870 --> 26:44.737
Oh shit!

26:46.673 --> 26:48.007
Oh fuck!

26:48.007 --> 26:49.575
I'm fucked.

26:49.575 --> 26:52.544
Oh, I am so, so, so fucked.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.080
Give me a cigarette.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.181
- I thought you quit.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.749
- Don't start with me now.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.284
- It's my last one.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.719
- Chris!

26:59.719 --> 27:01.120
I just killed someone!

27:01.120 --> 27:05.091
I think I'm allowed the
last fucking cigarette!

27:16.869 --> 27:17.804
- Fuck, man!

27:17.804 --> 27:19.138
They're fucking eating him!

27:30.316 --> 27:31.183
- Katya,

27:32.184 --> 27:34.520
you're scaring me.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.989
Helps me even my breathing.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.557
- Are you seeing
someone about this?

27:38.557 --> 27:40.626
- Of course I am.

27:40.626 --> 27:44.831
- And they cleared you to
come back to work, right?

27:47.399 --> 27:48.835
Katya,

27:48.835 --> 27:50.937
this is getting serious.

27:50.937 --> 27:54.173
I need you to tell
me what you know.

27:54.173 --> 27:58.377
Why my people are getting shot
at in their place of work.

27:59.746 --> 28:00.579
Katya?

28:01.814 --> 28:03.850
Are you listening to me?

28:05.251 --> 28:06.185
Katya?!

28:06.185 --> 28:07.820
- Shut the fuck up!

28:20.666 --> 28:22.534
What was on the drive?

28:24.270 --> 28:26.505
What was on the drive?

28:26.505 --> 28:27.473
- Oh, shit.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.308
I'm not getting a signal.

28:29.308 --> 28:32.011
This is bad. This is really bad.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.183
- Studio, this is Alex Petit.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.150
Lou

28:42.088 --> 28:43.455
Goddamn it, where are they?

28:43.455 --> 28:44.390
We're out of range!

28:44.390 --> 28:46.458
You fucking idiot!

28:46.458 --> 28:48.127
Look at it out there.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.528
This is about us now,

28:49.528 --> 28:50.362
not them.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.697
Not her.

28:51.697 --> 28:53.665
- You know we have
to go back, Chris.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.367
We can't deal with
this on our own.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.735
- Why can't you tell
your old man

28:56.735 --> 28:57.970
I don't have to do shit.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.106
I'm not gonna die
for your woman!

29:01.941 --> 29:04.243
Do you not see what's
happening out there?

29:04.243 --> 29:06.078
We need people! We need a group!

29:06.078 --> 29:07.246
- We've got a group.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.480
You and me!

29:08.480 --> 29:10.482
Why is that never
enough for you?

29:10.482 --> 29:12.518
- Look, I won't make it
back there on my own,

29:12.518 --> 29:14.653
but I'm going either way.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.157
I need you on my
side here, Chris.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.391
Not Katya.

29:19.391 --> 29:20.827
Me!

29:20.827 --> 29:23.462
I'm asking you, as your brother,

29:23.462 --> 29:25.031
what's it gonna take?

29:29.468 --> 29:30.536
- Fuck!

29:30.536 --> 29:32.404
Let's get the fuck out of here!

29:48.921 --> 29:51.690
I'll
cover this side!

29:52.825 --> 29:54.460
- Lock the door, now!

29:54.460 --> 29:56.328
Civilians, clear the doors now!

29:57.596 --> 29:59.065
Who are you?

29:59.065 --> 30:00.799
- What part of what I just
said need followup questions?

30:00.799 --> 30:01.633
- No, no, no.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.605
Good.

30:06.605 --> 30:07.974
- Look, everyone go
back to your offices,

30:07.974 --> 30:09.575
lock yourselves in and hide.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.110
The building is under attack.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.645
- The lift's been blocked.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.480
How?

30:15.681 --> 30:16.615
- What you mean,
we're under attack?

30:18.084 --> 30:19.952
- I've gotta get out of here.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.154
- No!

30:25.557 --> 30:27.193
- This way, quick!

30:33.632 --> 30:35.067
!

30:48.614 --> 30:49.982
- Wait, hold on.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.219
Jill, come in.

30:53.219 --> 30:54.086
Jill?

30:57.589 --> 30:58.557
- Thank God.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.625
Jill, it's Mark from downstairs.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.427
Listen, where are you?

31:02.594 --> 31:04.063
I'm on break.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.465
- Look, I need you at the second
floor maintenance lift now!

31:06.465 --> 31:08.034
And bring your keys, okay?

31:08.034 --> 31:08.867
- Okay.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.868
Be down in 10 minutes.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.803
- No, your break
is fucking over!

31:11.803 --> 31:13.405
Get down here right now!

31:34.326 --> 31:35.594
A state of emergency!

31:35.594 --> 31:37.863
I'm telling you, it's
too little, too late!

31:37.863 --> 31:39.565
Everywhere is in
a state of panic!

31:39.565 --> 31:41.934
It's totally out of control!

31:51.543 --> 31:53.545
- We've waited
quite long enough.

31:53.545 --> 31:55.414
I've got dinner
plans this evening.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.349
Come on, girl! Play it!

31:58.284 --> 31:59.718
- My name is Sally.

31:59.718 --> 32:01.753
I've worked here for two years.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.555
Lou said to wait for Katya
before we do anything,

32:03.555 --> 32:04.991
so we're waiting.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.194
- Listen to me,

32:08.194 --> 32:09.728
Sally.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.830
If you value your future here,

32:11.830 --> 32:14.600
you'll do your very best
to keep on my good side.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.036
All I have to do is
to put in a phone call

32:17.036 --> 32:18.937
and I'll never see you again.

32:18.937 --> 32:19.972
Now play it!

32:21.207 --> 32:22.741
- Don't you worry.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.510
He gave me, word for word,

32:24.510 --> 32:26.645
that exact same speech in '98

32:26.645 --> 32:30.049
when I refused to suck his
dick at the Christmas party.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.483
Stuck in the '70s.

33:11.557 --> 33:12.758
- Oh, hello.

33:18.030 --> 33:18.997
- Carpenter!

33:18.997 --> 33:20.366
Carpenter, come!

33:22.568 --> 33:23.435
- Wait!

33:23.435 --> 33:24.303
No!

33:45.557 --> 33:47.759
- Listen, bitch, what the
fuck do you know about it?

33:49.495 --> 33:51.497
- I'll tell you
what's wrong with me.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.600
I am sick and tired
of being disrespected

33:54.600 --> 33:55.867
by this woman!

33:55.867 --> 33:58.837
- Peter, you need
to earn respect,

33:58.837 --> 34:00.739
you sexist asshole.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.274
- I have earned it.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.543
I have been the
cornerstone of this network

34:04.543 --> 34:05.477
since 1975!

34:06.612 --> 34:08.780
- Here we go. Same old story.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.117
You're like a broken
fucking record.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.618
- Hey!

34:12.618 --> 34:13.719
Not the time.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.759
Play the video.

34:23.962 --> 34:25.797
- This is Professor
Greg Laborde.

34:25.797 --> 34:29.268
This is my final report
regarding the giant virus,

34:29.268 --> 34:31.969
Pandora Viridae Siberiacum.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.840
This is not a sanctioned report.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.542
It is my confession.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.579
Discovered in the frozen soil

34:40.579 --> 34:44.382
beneath the now melting
permafrost in Siberia.

34:44.382 --> 34:47.753
It survived in stasis for
around 30 thousand years.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.289
At first it appeared dormant.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.757
Harmless to humans.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.860
However, when introduced
into our rat's bloodstreams,

34:54.860 --> 34:56.762
we found that it had awakened,

34:56.762 --> 34:59.565
infecting the rats as
rapidly and competitively

34:59.565 --> 35:01.933
as anything I've ever seen.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.704
Pandora Viridae caused
total circularity shutdown

35:05.704 --> 35:09.441
over a variable period
of one to 24 hours.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.777
In the broadest terms,

35:11.777 --> 35:13.645
the rats were still functioning,

35:13.645 --> 35:16.682
albeit, in a heightened
state of aggression.

35:16.682 --> 35:21.019
Even though the virus had
effectively killed them.

35:21.019 --> 35:24.756
I was able to procure a
sizable government contract

35:24.756 --> 35:27.125
almost immediately.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.494
Unlimited finance,

35:28.494 --> 35:29.961
resources.

35:29.961 --> 35:34.266
They wanted me to prolong the
lives of willing soldiers.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.667
Allow them to keep fighting,

35:35.667 --> 35:37.536
even though they should be dead,

35:37.536 --> 35:38.804
incapacitated.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.972
- No, this is a hoax.

35:40.972 --> 35:41.907
- Bollocks!

35:43.342 --> 35:46.745
Left-wing, anti-coalition
propaganda is what it is.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.214
There's no virus.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.718
- Laborde is easily the most
credible source I've ever had.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.152
Why would he lie?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.521
- I don't know.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.988
Cause he's a fucking liar.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.790
- I knew it was unethical.

35:58.790 --> 36:02.528
I told myself that the end
somehow justifies the means.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.129
I was wrong.

36:04.129 --> 36:06.031
Transference occurs by ingestion

36:06.031 --> 36:08.267
of contaminated bodily fluids.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.968
Either orally

36:09.968 --> 36:13.405
or through contact of
infected material with,

36:13.405 --> 36:15.774
say, an open wound.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.577
A scratch or a bite has
proved fatal in 100 percent

36:18.577 --> 36:21.380
of the cases we've all observed.

36:21.380 --> 36:24.350
Once infected, these
automatons become

36:24.350 --> 36:28.119
single-minded in their
effort to consume

36:28.119 --> 36:30.021
living organic matter.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.792
They gain no biological
sustenance whatsoever

36:34.826 --> 36:36.528
from this practice,

36:36.528 --> 36:39.465
but it seems to be
all that drives them.

36:39.465 --> 36:42.033
Once fully reanimated,

36:42.033 --> 36:44.336
removal of the head or
destruction of the brains

36:44.336 --> 36:47.138
is the surest
method of dispatch.

36:48.474 --> 36:51.042
They just keep coming.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.279
On February the 23, 2017,

36:53.279 --> 36:55.814
the lab was breached.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.916
Most likely a terrorist cell.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.519
Whoever they are, they must
have had a source on the inside.

37:00.519 --> 37:02.988
They knew exactly what
they were looking for

37:02.988 --> 37:05.291
and they took everything.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.125
Enough samples were stolen

37:07.125 --> 37:11.096
to target at least 40
population zones at once.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.198
Should that be the case,

37:13.198 --> 37:16.234
it would be the extinction of

37:16.234 --> 37:19.438
at least 99 percent
of the human race.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.174
I don't know what's
going on anymore,

37:23.174 --> 37:24.276
who to trust.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.177
I'm getting out.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.613
I'm going to wipe my data,

37:27.613 --> 37:29.080
destroy all my samples,

37:29.080 --> 37:30.015
everything.

37:30.916 --> 37:31.783
Soon,

37:33.685 --> 37:36.788
this will be the
only empirical trace

37:36.788 --> 37:39.325
of Pandora Viridae Siberiacum.

37:40.426 --> 37:43.862
I'm going to expose
it to the world.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.598
But I've made my choices

37:46.598 --> 37:48.199
and I will suffer
the consequences

37:48.199 --> 37:50.001
along with everybody else.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.645
It's not safe here, Katya.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.548
I'm not sure if
it's safe anywhere.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.283
I'm gonna have to cut this.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.820
I'm sorry, Katya, to
burden you with this.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.759
I just didn't know
who else to turn to.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.262
You have integrity

38:17.262 --> 38:18.296
and courage.

38:20.198 --> 38:22.000
Goodbye, Katya,

38:22.000 --> 38:23.201
and good luck.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.137
- Come on, Katya.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.907
The extinction of
the human race?

38:28.907 --> 38:30.275
Who is this guy?

38:34.746 --> 38:36.247
He just blew his brains
out in front of me

38:36.247 --> 38:39.284
because he believed
he was infected.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.490
- Oh my God.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.292
- No.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.429
This isn't real.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.499
This isn't happening.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.334
This isn't happening.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.706
How much time do we have?

39:00.706 --> 39:02.441
We've gotta get out of here.

39:02.441 --> 39:03.308
- No.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.678
Right now, we're secure.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.080
If we leave the studio,

39:09.080 --> 39:10.949
we're totally exposed.

39:12.784 --> 39:13.652
Jesus.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.021
- No.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.124
That's not real.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.693
This isn't happening.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.462
That's not happening.

39:26.432 --> 39:29.901
- Lou, why haven't we heard
anything about this before?

39:29.901 --> 39:33.439
What are the other
networks broadcasting?

39:40.479 --> 39:41.913
- All down.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.654
- Sally's right.

39:48.654 --> 39:50.456
I'm not staying here.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.325
- This is your story.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.194
We've got to put it
out there, warn people.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.896
We can't just abandon our posts.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.598
- I never said that.

40:00.732 --> 40:01.867
Look, we don't have
to physically be here

40:01.867 --> 40:03.401
to put this on air, do we?

40:03.401 --> 40:05.403
Can't you broadcast on a loop?

40:05.403 --> 40:07.539
- Well, yes, but it would
take hours to set up.

40:07.539 --> 40:08.574
- Set it up.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.676
I'll shoot an address,

40:10.676 --> 40:11.877
we'll paste it on to
Laborde's confession

40:11.877 --> 40:12.878
and then we'll
leave it out there

40:12.878 --> 40:14.846
for as long as the power holds.

40:14.846 --> 40:15.781
Agreed?

40:15.781 --> 40:17.783
- You better have a plan.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.050
- I do.

40:19.050 --> 40:19.918
Survive.

40:30.896 --> 40:32.397
- All over the world

40:32.397 --> 40:36.602
there are these digital
broadcast satellite channels.

40:38.369 --> 40:41.306
Independent of the big networks.

40:41.306 --> 40:42.941
It's a long shot,

40:42.941 --> 40:45.310
but there's just a chance
that maybe some of them

40:45.310 --> 40:46.478
picked up...

40:58.990 --> 41:00.458
Oh, God.

41:02.528 --> 41:03.394
- Paris.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.767
Martin lives there.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.608
- I'm so scared.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.512
- It's okay.

41:50.075 --> 41:51.710
- Shut that thing up, man!

41:51.710 --> 41:53.378
- Still no signal.

41:53.378 --> 41:54.713
- I don't know what
you're smiling about.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.782
She might as well be
on the fucking moon.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.216
- Come on, we've come this far.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.751
What's an extra mile?

41:59.751 --> 42:01.386
- It's pushing our luck
is what it is, Alex, okay?

42:01.386 --> 42:03.722
She's not part of
the fucking plan.

42:03.722 --> 42:06.725
- Don't force me to make
the hard decision, Chris.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.259
Don't do that to me again.

42:09.227 --> 42:10.562
When there's pussy in the mix.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.330
You sound like a
little fucking brat.

42:12.330 --> 42:13.364
- Do you know who
you sound like?

42:13.364 --> 42:14.733
- Don't you fucking dare, man!

42:14.733 --> 42:15.667
- You sound like dad.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.539
What the fuck?

42:42.661 --> 42:43.494
Run!

43:05.583 --> 43:09.487
(reporter speaking
foreign language)

43:30.876 --> 43:31.710
- Fuck!

43:31.710 --> 43:32.543
- One.

43:32.543 --> 43:33.378
Two.

43:33.378 --> 43:34.212
Three.

43:36.915 --> 43:38.349
- Whoa!

43:46.692 --> 43:47.558
Easy.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.928
- We're closed.

43:51.296 --> 43:52.597
Get away from me!
 All right!

43:52.597 --> 43:53.531
- Get out of my shop!

43:53.531 --> 43:55.200
- Chill out! Chill out!

43:56.601 --> 43:57.602
- Fuck!

44:00.071 --> 44:00.906
Christian!

44:06.144 --> 44:07.178
- Help me.

44:07.178 --> 44:08.046
- Chris!

44:18.489 --> 44:20.558
I think I broke my
fucking shoulder.

44:20.558 --> 44:22.994
- Holy shit, they're so fast.

44:22.994 --> 44:24.362
- Don't kill me.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.765
Just take whatever
you want and go.

44:28.299 --> 44:30.535
- Oh great and this is
what we're going now?

44:30.535 --> 44:32.938
- Look, if it's as bad
as it looks out there,

44:32.938 --> 44:34.806
I'll never eat quick right now.

44:34.806 --> 44:35.673
Are you?

44:40.645 --> 44:42.213
- Can't feel my legs.

44:42.213 --> 44:43.715
- Come on, man,
you gotta get up.

44:43.715 --> 44:44.549
- Okay.

44:45.583 --> 44:47.652
I can't. Just leave me.

44:47.652 --> 44:49.020
- Shit, this guy's
going nowhere.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.790
- Well then, I guess
we can take these.

44:51.790 --> 44:53.091
And check this.

44:55.026 --> 44:57.262
Yeah, we're not in bad shape.

44:57.262 --> 44:59.564
- We'd be in better shape
if there were more of us.

44:59.564 --> 45:00.799
- We have to try and manage.

45:01.632 --> 45:03.068
- Now we've got a gun.

45:03.068 --> 45:05.103
- Yeah and how many
bullets are in that thing?

45:05.103 --> 45:06.504
- Four. Okay.

45:06.504 --> 45:07.906
But it's better than none.

45:07.906 --> 45:10.008
Anyway, what if I
was wrong before?

45:10.008 --> 45:12.410
What if it's not as bad
as it looks out there?

45:12.410 --> 45:14.913
Maybe the army will be
through here shortly.

45:14.913 --> 45:16.882
- I know it's bad
enough that we need more

45:16.882 --> 45:18.616
than four fucking bullets.

45:18.616 --> 45:19.985
I'm not waiting for the army.

45:19.985 --> 45:21.319
I don't wanna die here.

45:21.319 --> 45:22.520
We need to cover ground.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.823
A car, I don't care, anything.

45:26.491 --> 45:27.658
- I don't care.

45:27.658 --> 45:29.895
Take your pick
after we get Katya.

45:29.895 --> 45:31.362
- Just boost a car.

45:31.362 --> 45:32.764
What if we set off an alarm?

45:32.764 --> 45:33.965
Then we're fucked!

45:33.965 --> 45:35.300
- We're already fucked!

45:37.969 --> 45:39.037
Get that through your head

45:39.037 --> 45:41.139
before you get us both killed.

45:41.139 --> 45:42.173
- Gentlemen!

45:43.141 --> 45:44.342
I have a car!

45:46.211 --> 45:48.746
You're the one airing
your daddy issues

45:48.746 --> 45:49.915
in the middle of the street

45:49.915 --> 45:51.682
where we're supposed
to be hiding!

45:51.682 --> 45:52.884
I have a car!
 Fuck you!

45:52.884 --> 45:54.185
- You gutted me,
your piece of shit.

45:54.185 --> 45:55.420
That was your fault!

45:55.420 --> 45:57.355
- Oh, of course,
it's always my fault.

45:57.355 --> 45:59.457
- It's nice you
finally admit it, man.

46:00.992 --> 46:02.760
You need to grow up and take
some fucking responsibility.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.029
- Gentlemen!

46:04.029 --> 46:05.163
I have a car!

46:09.634 --> 46:11.636
A nice car.

46:17.608 --> 46:20.211
This is not
a nice fucking car.

46:20.211 --> 46:21.512
Shit! Look out!

46:23.348 --> 46:25.183
Where the fuck did you
learn to drive like this?

46:25.183 --> 46:26.985
- I took a rally
driving class last year.

46:26.985 --> 46:27.953
Thank fuck you did.

46:27.953 --> 46:29.420
- No, thank Katya.

46:29.420 --> 46:32.623
- What are you doing,
you crazy fuck?!

46:33.624 --> 46:34.759
Hold on!

46:50.408 --> 46:52.110
Oh my God! I can't
believe that we made it!

46:52.110 --> 46:54.512
That was fucking awesome, man!

47:00.218 --> 47:01.152
We need a plan!

47:01.152 --> 47:02.187
I'm thinking the docks.

47:03.021 --> 47:03.889
Okay, I like it.

47:03.889 --> 47:05.056
We could find a boat.

47:05.056 --> 47:06.657
Tell me that's not a solid plan.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.393
- Maybe I could get a
signal on the walkie.

47:08.393 --> 47:09.928
- Fuck the walkie.

47:11.029 --> 47:13.798
- If we can just, I
don't know, talk to her.

47:13.798 --> 47:15.700
What if she's waiting for us?

47:15.700 --> 47:16.935
- There you go again, "what if."

47:16.935 --> 47:18.369
What if she's dead?

47:18.369 --> 47:20.771
- Look, why are we bickering
like two little girls?

47:20.771 --> 47:22.840
I mean, we need to keep moving.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.809
As long as we're in this car--

47:25.977 --> 47:26.878
- Fuck!

47:28.246 --> 47:29.847
- Oh shit!

47:42.127 --> 47:43.428
Fuck!

47:46.397 --> 47:47.532
Move!

47:47.532 --> 47:49.067
Come on, hurry up!

47:50.668 --> 47:52.403
Come on, let's go!

47:59.610 --> 48:03.714
(police sirens wailing

48:03.714 --> 48:04.849
We
have videos coming in

48:04.849 --> 48:06.351
from the internet of attacks.

48:06.351 --> 48:08.920
Head shots.
Arm yourself and shoot to kill.

48:08.920 --> 48:11.089
You gotta go for the head shots.

48:11.089 --> 48:12.857
God help you all.

48:12.857 --> 48:14.692
God help America.

48:14.692 --> 48:16.995
God help the future
we hope of ourselves.

48:36.481 --> 48:38.516
- Ladies and gentlemen,

48:38.516 --> 48:40.818
my name is Katya Nevin

48:40.818 --> 48:44.222
and this is an
emergency address.

48:46.224 --> 48:47.425
As many of you

48:48.493 --> 48:51.196
are no doubt already
experiencing,

48:51.997 --> 48:53.031
the country,

48:54.132 --> 48:56.367
perhaps the entire planet,

48:56.367 --> 48:57.935
is under siege

48:57.935 --> 49:02.140
by the reanimated bodies
of the recently dead.

49:02.140 --> 49:05.810
The cause looks to be
the world wide release

49:05.810 --> 49:09.514
of a virus called Pandora
Viridae Siberiacum.

49:09.514 --> 49:12.383
Make no mistake,
this is an attack

49:13.784 --> 49:17.622
on a scale the likes of
which has never been seen.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.590
At the time of this address,

49:19.590 --> 49:23.461
we have no information
as to the perpetrators.

49:24.595 --> 49:26.431
What is to follow is
a video confession

49:26.431 --> 49:30.068
from the professor who
discovered this virus.

49:30.068 --> 49:32.937
Do not direct your
anger towards him.

49:32.937 --> 49:34.205
Heed his words.

49:35.340 --> 49:37.475
It is imperative that
as many as possible

49:37.475 --> 49:39.777
survive these first days.

49:39.777 --> 49:43.948
Humanity will need you
for what comes next.

49:43.948 --> 49:44.815
As of now,

49:46.417 --> 49:50.288
our immediate concerns
are right at our doors.

49:51.756 --> 49:53.124
Your loved ones,

49:53.991 --> 49:56.594
all your friends or colleagues,

49:57.428 --> 49:59.730
if they have been infected,

50:01.299 --> 50:03.401
they are now lost to you.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.472
They are your enemies.

50:08.906 --> 50:12.443
And they must be approached
with either extreme caution

50:12.443 --> 50:14.379
or extreme prejudice.

50:18.783 --> 50:22.587
A new predator succeeds
us on the food chain.

50:24.589 --> 50:27.058
Survival now comes at a cost.

50:28.226 --> 50:30.428
Find it and pay it gladly.

50:33.598 --> 50:35.366
Ladies and gentlemen,

50:36.434 --> 50:38.736
I wish you the best of luck.

51:00.758 --> 51:04.962
(reporter speaking
foreign language)

51:57.182 --> 51:59.116
- Studio, this is Alex Petit.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.085
Katya, are you there?

52:03.488 --> 52:06.691
- Studio, this is
Alex Petit, respond.

52:08.092 --> 52:10.495
Do you even know
how to pilot a boat?

52:10.495 --> 52:12.197
- You captain a boat, dickhead.

52:12.197 --> 52:14.399
- You captain ship, bitch,

52:14.399 --> 52:15.366
not a boat.

52:16.501 --> 52:18.869
- This is Professor
Greg Laborde.

52:18.869 --> 52:21.372
April the 22nd, 2017.

52:21.372 --> 52:22.240
Time...

52:24.509 --> 52:25.376
4:09 AM.

52:28.078 --> 52:31.582
This is my final report
regard the giant virus,

52:31.582 --> 52:33.851
Pandora Viridae Siberiacum.

52:35.853 --> 52:38.723
This is not a sanctioned report.

52:38.723 --> 52:40.425
It is my confession.

52:43.861 --> 52:45.796
Discovered in the frozen soil

52:45.796 --> 52:49.434
beneath the now melting
permafrost in Siberia.

52:49.434 --> 52:53.204
We estimated that Pandora
Viridae Siberiacum

52:53.204 --> 52:57.608
survived in stasis for
around 30 thousand years.

52:57.608 --> 52:59.109
At first it appeared dormant.

52:59.109 --> 53:00.578
Harmless to humans.

53:27.838 --> 53:30.275
- Andrea, stay with me!

53:30.275 --> 53:31.709
Whoa!

53:44.389 --> 53:46.791
- Everyone! Everyone, calm down!

53:47.958 --> 53:49.760
Fucking calm down?!

53:49.760 --> 53:53.331
We're gonna die
in this room now!

53:53.331 --> 53:55.500
- If we stay put in the studio,

53:55.500 --> 53:56.767
we're locked down.

53:56.767 --> 53:58.269
We can stay alive
until the army--

53:59.537 --> 54:01.472
Who is gonna come here for us?

54:01.472 --> 54:03.541
Either those things out
there or the police.

54:03.541 --> 54:05.776
- This is getting
completely out of control.

54:05.776 --> 54:06.611
- All right!

54:06.611 --> 54:08.346
All right, it's bad!

54:08.346 --> 54:10.648
But where are we going to run?

54:10.648 --> 54:12.717
If one of you leaves the studio,

54:12.717 --> 54:14.452
we are all put in jeopardy.

54:14.452 --> 54:17.087
Look, we need to document this.

54:17.955 --> 54:19.490
We need to put this out there.

54:19.490 --> 54:21.025
The public needs to know.

54:21.025 --> 54:21.992
- Fuck off!

54:21.992 --> 54:24.329
Fuck off with your crusade, Lou.

54:24.329 --> 54:26.431
Stick it up your fucking ass!

54:26.431 --> 54:28.466
I'm getting out of here

54:28.466 --> 54:30.234
and if anybody wants to live,

54:30.234 --> 54:31.101
let's go!

54:32.403 --> 54:35.272
Get your skinny
ass out of the way!

54:35.272 --> 54:37.141
- Peter, you're right.

54:38.142 --> 54:40.244
We stay here and we're dead.

54:40.244 --> 54:42.279
We can't make it down
all of those stairs.

54:42.279 --> 54:44.048
Not without weapons,
without torches,

54:44.048 --> 54:46.183
we'd be overrun in
about five seconds.

54:46.183 --> 54:48.285
!

54:48.285 --> 54:51.322
We have sail down to the
front of the fucking building?

54:51.322 --> 54:55.693
- There's a roof access
stairway on this floor.

54:55.693 --> 54:58.896
Alex and I used to eat
lunch up there sometimes.

54:58.896 --> 55:00.998
Look, the only way to get to it

55:00.998 --> 55:02.733
is through the studio.

55:02.733 --> 55:05.503
So it should be
clear, in theory.

55:07.037 --> 55:08.973
There's a fuse box.

55:08.973 --> 55:12.076
We trip the switch, try
and ride the lift down.

55:12.076 --> 55:13.611
It might take more
than one trip,

55:13.611 --> 55:16.213
but I can guarantee
more of us will survive.

55:16.213 --> 55:18.082
- And what makes you
so fucking qualified

55:18.082 --> 55:20.351
to make this assessment?!

55:20.351 --> 55:21.552
- Look, Peter,

55:23.621 --> 55:24.555
all of you!

55:25.490 --> 55:27.358
I can't make you wait.

55:28.258 --> 55:30.861
But if you leave
now, you'll die.

55:30.861 --> 55:32.296
It's that simple.

55:33.831 --> 55:35.733
You think you can outrun them?

55:35.733 --> 55:38.335
After two heart attacks, Peter?

55:39.169 --> 55:40.037
Come on.

55:41.138 --> 55:43.541
You need to be
smarter than that.

55:43.541 --> 55:45.576
We all need to be smart.

55:47.412 --> 55:50.214
Just give me ten minutes.

55:50.214 --> 55:51.549
I'll have the power back,

55:51.549 --> 55:55.319
we'll have lights and
we'll stand a chance.

55:55.319 --> 55:56.421
- Fine! Fine!

55:57.455 --> 55:58.423
10 minutes!

55:59.724 --> 56:00.625
- Fuck off.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.160
What about the broadcast?

56:03.160 --> 56:04.862
- Broadcast's dead.

56:04.862 --> 56:06.130
- So are we.

56:06.130 --> 56:06.997
Why run?

56:08.633 --> 56:12.102
- One way or the other, I'm
getting out of this building.

56:12.102 --> 56:13.738
The decision's made.

56:15.339 --> 56:18.242
Studio, this is
Alex Petit, are you there?

56:18.242 --> 56:21.479
Studio, this is
Alex Petit, respond.

56:22.312 --> 56:23.147
Who is this?

56:25.282 --> 56:26.684
Are you okay?

56:26.684 --> 56:29.554
- Oh God, I thought
for sure you were dead.

56:29.554 --> 56:30.721
Where are you?

56:30.721 --> 56:31.656
- We're at the docks.

56:31.656 --> 56:32.490
It's not looking good out here.

56:32.490 --> 56:33.424
We're coming to get you.

56:33.424 --> 56:34.559
- We're not, Alex.

56:34.559 --> 56:36.026
We're fucking not!

56:36.026 --> 56:37.094
Is that Christian?

56:38.563 --> 56:40.565
- Alex, don't come back
here, the place is infested.

56:40.565 --> 56:41.832
- Katya, it's breaking up.

56:41.832 --> 56:43.033
We're coming back to get you.

56:43.033 --> 56:45.102
We're coming now.

56:45.102 --> 56:47.004
- Alex, don't come back here.

56:47.004 --> 56:49.306
Can you hear me, please?

56:49.306 --> 56:51.108
Alex, respond.

56:51.108 --> 56:52.176
- Christian!

56:54.078 --> 56:55.345
- Fucking dick.

56:56.747 --> 56:57.982
- Fuck off!

57:18.636 --> 57:20.471
- She's pregnant.

57:20.471 --> 57:21.906
Katya's pregnant.

57:24.008 --> 57:25.309
- That city is a mass grave.

57:25.309 --> 57:27.845
To go in there, you're
not coming back out.

57:27.845 --> 57:29.313
This is it, Alex.

57:32.683 --> 57:34.619
Fine, then go.

57:34.619 --> 57:36.320
I don't do goodbyes.

57:46.897 --> 57:51.101
(reporter speaking
foreign language)

58:38.148 --> 58:39.083
- Oh, shit!

59:12.249 --> 59:16.153
- You said we were
locked down up here.

59:16.153 --> 59:17.021
- Yeah.

59:22.627 --> 59:23.661
- The doors.

59:25.462 --> 59:28.098
They're on reinforced
electronic locks.

59:28.098 --> 59:32.970
Pretty much impossible to
bypass without a keycard.

59:32.970 --> 59:36.140
- And how do they
work without power?

59:42.747 --> 59:44.982
Fuck!

59:54.491 --> 59:56.260
- Mother fucker!

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:44.942
Eat this, you bitch!

01:00:53.951 --> 01:00:54.985
- Andrea.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.887
Andrea, come on, come on.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:57.955
You're gonna be okay.

01:00:57.955 --> 01:00:59.123
She's gonna be okay.

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:10.935
Fuck!

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:07.717
- I thought you were dead.

01:03:15.659 --> 01:03:16.961
- I don't know.

01:03:16.961 --> 01:03:18.795
It was chaos.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:20.730
- You saw the video.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:24.034
You know how easily
this thing spreads.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:34.244
- Everybody, can I
have your attention?

01:03:36.881 --> 01:03:38.515
We're safe for now.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:44.321
At least, unless the
power fails again.

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:48.592
But there is something
that we need to address.

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:51.695
This is not going
to be easy to hear.

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:55.632
The virus that
causes this illness

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:59.103
is extremely contagious.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:04.108
If you were bitten or scratched,

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:10.080
there's a high chance that
you could be infected.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.150
- Get the fuck out of
the way, you stupid cow.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.551
- You're bitten!

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:15.819
He's bitten!

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.621
- I am not bitten.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:23.560
- And who do you think
you're fucking talking to?

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.030
I am the face of the network.

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:28.232
If it wasn't for me.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:41.878
Calm down!

01:04:42.947 --> 01:04:44.348
- He was bitten.

01:04:44.348 --> 01:04:45.215
I had to!

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:48.152
- Calm down.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:52.356
Sally.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:54.058
Sally.

01:04:54.058 --> 01:04:54.925
Help.

01:04:57.761 --> 01:04:59.196
- I had to.

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:00.030
I had to.

01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:04.568
- Jesus.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.083
He's still moving.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:48.512
(reporter speaking
foreign language)

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.934
I need you.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.506
Alex, please respond.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:19.409
Please.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:32.356
I can't do this on my own.

01:07:12.262 --> 01:07:13.797
Lou, what's happened?

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.799
- They were out there

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.667
waiting for us.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:18.868
We're trapped.

01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:22.339
- Alex and Christian
are alive out there,

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:23.973
which means there
must be others too.

01:07:23.973 --> 01:07:26.076
We can make it, we
just need a plan.

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.278
- We have a plan.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:32.416
We're going to fortify
the studio as best we can.

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:36.920
Water?

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.423
- There's bottled water
in all the dressing rooms.

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:41.391
That'll last awhile
if a ration it

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:42.759
and as for food,

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.363
we'll figure something out.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:51.301
Lou, that's not an answer.

01:07:51.301 --> 01:07:55.172
- Katya, you didn't see
what we're up against.

01:07:56.173 --> 01:07:59.376
We are TV professionals,
not warriors.

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:03.347
- Don't make me do this alone.

01:08:03.347 --> 01:08:04.481
- Sweetheart,

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.484
I think you should lie down.

01:08:07.484 --> 01:08:08.352
- No!

01:08:10.154 --> 01:08:12.021
- Face reality, Katya.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:16.859
You're just as doomed
as the rest of us.

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:20.464
- I've been doomed before, Lou.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.033
I didn't lie down then.

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:27.703
I'm not lying down now.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:31.375
Everyone listen to me.

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:34.644
If we stay here, this
studio will be our tomb.

01:08:36.412 --> 01:08:37.881
- We could fight.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.684
Isn't that what we do?

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:45.955
Leah, I've watched your
career since I was girl.

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.158
You're one of the original
female news anchors.

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.560
A crusader for women everywhere.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.429
A fighter.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.635
And Lou, an openly gay man
working in the media in the 70s

01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.868
and you're telling me

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:01.770
you don't know how to
fight for something?

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.573
I don't believe that.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.544
Yeah, this might be bigger
than everyone one of us,

01:09:07.544 --> 01:09:09.578
but if we fight together,

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.615
if we work as a crew,

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:13.149
we stand a chance.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.654
There is always a way.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.576
- Don't you guys
get pissed tested?

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:41.877
I did.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:42.746
- Look!

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:45.782
They're planning something.

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.786
Of course they are.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:54.157
We're ditching them.

01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:57.761
They've become a
detriment to the mission.

01:09:57.761 --> 01:10:01.030
- What was the last
admission, Proteus?

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.901
"This is Ashcroft
to command. Over.

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:07.371
"Does anybody copy?

01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:09.439
"This is Agent Ashcroft. Over.

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:11.841
"Does anybody respond?"

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:18.014
Gentlemen, if you please
put your MP-5s on the ground

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:19.283
on your way out.

01:10:19.283 --> 01:10:20.850
- Fucking scumbag.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.754
MP-5s! Ground, now!

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:31.695
I could do you now

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:34.998
or you could take your
chances out there.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:57.454
Fuck.

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:26.350
- Sally, get up.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:27.817
- I can't.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:29.653
- Look, there's not
second chances now, Sally.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:30.987
Once we're gone,
you're on your own.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:33.189
- Katya, I've been bitten.

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:35.925
- Oh, Sally.

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:40.930
Oh, God.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:45.201
- That's it. It's fine.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:46.803
Just leave me here.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.906
It won't be so bad.

01:11:55.379 --> 01:11:56.880
- Good luck.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.281
- You too.

01:11:58.281 --> 01:12:00.350
You need it more than me.

01:12:07.223 --> 01:12:09.192
- Okay, guys, remember.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.697
As hard as you can
and at the skull only.

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:17.434
These things won't go down
until the brain's destroyed.

01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:18.568
Be warned.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:20.704
Hesitate and you're dead.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:24.474
Are we ready?

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:25.675
- We're ready.

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:27.677
- Let's go.

01:12:44.828 --> 01:12:46.563
- This way.

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:11.688
- Kill him.

01:13:11.688 --> 01:13:12.622
- I can't kill him.

01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:13.690
- Kill him, for fuck's sake.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:14.558
- I can't!

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:40.884
- Shit.

01:14:00.804 --> 01:14:01.671
Fuck you!

01:14:03.873 --> 01:14:04.741
Fuck!

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.182
- Okay, Lou.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:48.384
On my mark, open the door.

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:50.419
Everyone,

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.890
get ready to start swinging.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:54.758
Okay?

01:14:59.162 --> 01:14:59.996
You ready?

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:02.932
- Yes.

01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:09.305
- Now!

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:38.935
- Katya!

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:56.620
- Katya,

01:15:57.721 --> 01:15:59.255
are you all right?

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.292
Someone help me get
her to the studio.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:07.496
Katya?

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.033
- Fuck!

01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:53.843
Christian, get down.

01:16:54.711 --> 01:16:56.579
- You're welcome, bye the way.

01:16:56.579 --> 01:16:59.716
- Okay, there's a whole
bunch of police cars parked

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:00.984
in front of the building.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:03.152
If we can get to them
without being spotted,

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:05.054
we can sneak right
out to the door.

01:17:05.054 --> 01:17:06.589
- That's a relief.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:08.958
Were you just gonna run
across and hope for the best?

01:17:12.762 --> 01:17:13.930
- Misdirection.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:16.365
First rule of slight of hand.

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.434
Yes.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:30.880
Look,

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:32.716
it kills me that you had
the balls to tell dad

01:17:32.716 --> 01:17:34.718
to go fuck himself.

01:17:34.718 --> 01:17:37.721
I spent all these years
convinced that you abandoned me.

01:17:37.721 --> 01:17:39.088
But you know what?

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:41.390
You're the only one that didn't.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.860
You're not the coward, I am.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:45.361
Fuck that shit.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:47.296
I'm done with the past.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:53.269
Better late than never, right?

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:11.120
Go! Go!

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:11.988
Come on!

01:18:24.467 --> 01:18:26.002
- Oh shit!

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:05.308
What the fuck?

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:06.475
Get moving, Alex!

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:07.443
Go! Go! Go!

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.316
Go!

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:31.300
Go! Go!

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.168
- Oh shit!

01:19:33.569 --> 01:19:35.771
- Give me a fucking break!

01:19:38.174 --> 01:19:39.042
There!

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:42.278
We can't get out.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:44.447
- Fuck!

01:19:44.447 --> 01:19:45.548
I knew this would happen!

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:46.782
I fucking knew it!

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.351
- Calm down! I need
to fucking think!

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:50.486
There is one way in and out.

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:51.587
We're fucked!

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:53.256
- I'm sick of this shit, man.

01:19:53.256 --> 01:19:54.690
It's your fucking fault.

01:19:54.690 --> 01:19:55.959
If we weren't late this morning,

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.493
I would've been here on time.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:00.096
I'd be in the
building with Katya.

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:01.564
I had a good life!

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.900
You have to come
here and fuck it up,

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.434
like you fuck up everything!

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:28.491
Look at me.

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:31.394
I'm sorry.

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:32.795
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:34.830
I'm just losing my
fucking head, that's all.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.199
Do you trust me?

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:38.935
Do you trust me?

01:20:40.003 --> 01:20:40.836
Okay.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:41.938
I got a fucking plan.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:37.720
- I hope she's worth it.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:39.422
Let's go.

01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.908
- Five targets.

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:04.480
The entrance to the studio
is right behind them.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.648
- Proteus.

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:07.050
When we get in there.

01:23:07.050 --> 01:23:09.318
- Five targets, eight shots.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.519
That's plenty.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.277
- Jesus Christ.

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.413
Proteus, I'm done! I'm out!

01:23:37.413 --> 01:23:38.381
- Move now!

01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:39.682
- You're not listening to me.

01:23:39.682 --> 01:23:40.816
I don't know who's
feeding you orders,

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:43.352
but I don't like this.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.688
I don't feel I'm
on the right side.

01:23:45.688 --> 01:23:48.657
- There's only one side now,
Ashcroft, and I'm on it.

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:50.759
If you want to survive
this nightmare,

01:23:50.759 --> 01:23:52.828
you move the fuck
out of the way now!

01:24:00.336 --> 01:24:01.170
- God!

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.037
Oh God!

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:04.573
I don't think I can.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:09.245
- Just wait a minute.

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.521
- Wait! Wait!

01:24:18.521 --> 01:24:19.388
Wait!

01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:25.094
Come on.

01:24:27.863 --> 01:24:31.100
This fucking dick's
locked us out!

01:24:36.105 --> 01:24:36.972
- Lou.

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:42.845
You passed out.

01:24:42.845 --> 01:24:44.313
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:46.682
Is Sally?

01:24:47.883 --> 01:24:48.984
She's bitten.

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:56.559
We need to deal with her.

01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:01.096
Then I think we
should get everybody.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.698
- It's over, Katya.

01:25:03.899 --> 01:25:06.702
Can't you understand that?

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:07.570
- No.

01:25:08.471 --> 01:25:09.838
No, Lou, please.

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.876
No, I need to get out of here.

01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:16.679
- He's right.

01:25:24.253 --> 01:25:26.189
- You've got to go
and find her, man!

01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:27.356
- I can't leave you hear.

01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:28.624
- If you don't find her,

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:29.992
what was the point
of all this, Alex?

01:25:29.992 --> 01:25:31.927
- Maybe we can make
a break for it?

01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:32.961
- Take this.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.464
- Where the fuck
did you find that?

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:36.732
- Doesn't matter. Take it!

01:25:36.732 --> 01:25:38.501
And don't say I never
did anything for you.

01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:39.768
You gotta go, man!

01:25:39.768 --> 01:25:41.670
- Christian, I can't
just leave you hear!

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:42.538
- Just go!

01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:45.174
Go! Save her!

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:48.411
Go!

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:53.616
Take it.

01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:56.619
Mission accomplished.

01:26:01.357 --> 01:26:02.225
- Look,

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:04.493
there's no need.

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:06.094
- Fuck!

01:26:35.224 --> 01:26:36.759
- Fucking mentals.

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:44.367
All right, come and
get me, you fuckers!

01:26:55.077 --> 01:26:55.944
Fuck!

01:27:19.302 --> 01:27:20.168
- Yeah.

01:27:21.103 --> 01:27:22.905
I'm a liberator.

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:23.772
A hero.

01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:30.513
You've committed
global genocide.

01:27:30.513 --> 01:27:32.815
- And your government
created the weapon.

01:27:32.815 --> 01:27:34.383
Ironic, isn't it?

01:27:34.383 --> 01:27:37.286
The global population
is in crisis.

01:27:37.286 --> 01:27:40.222
We simply can't continue
sharing the planet.

01:27:40.222 --> 01:27:41.757
This is necessary.

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:47.463
- No!

01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:49.031
You don't get to ask.

01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:53.869
- Alex.

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:19.094
- Fuck!

01:29:02.905 --> 01:29:04.373
- Alex.

01:29:19.722 --> 01:29:22.758
- You shouldn't
have come back here.

01:29:24.793 --> 01:29:27.162
- I couldn't lose you again.

01:29:28.764 --> 01:29:31.434
- I've made a way out of here.

01:29:31.434 --> 01:29:33.335
But we need to hurry.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:36.505
I said hurry!

01:29:40.609 --> 01:29:41.810
Hurry!

01:30:08.771 --> 01:30:10.973
- Get away from me, bitch!

01:30:23.919 --> 01:30:25.420
- Before we went digital,

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.390
we had to get tapes up from
the vault in the basement.

01:30:29.725 --> 01:30:31.259
- I haven't thought
about it in years.

01:30:31.259 --> 01:30:32.828
It's a relic.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:38.767
- Thank God.

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:39.735
- Okay, yes!

01:30:39.735 --> 01:30:41.203
Katya, get in here.

01:30:41.203 --> 01:30:44.172
We're getting the
fuck out of here.

01:30:47.042 --> 01:30:47.910
Fuck!

01:30:51.614 --> 01:30:53.482
That's it, we're dead.

01:31:05.393 --> 01:31:06.261
- Come on.

01:31:16.038 --> 01:31:17.573
- Don't wait there, Katya!

01:31:17.573 --> 01:31:18.674
Go!

01:31:18.674 --> 01:31:19.542
Hurry!

01:31:21.043 --> 01:31:23.579
I can't hold this off forever.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.556
- I love you.

01:32:34.216 --> 01:32:36.051
- She needs you now.

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:37.653
- Lou, you're next.

01:32:37.653 --> 01:32:39.387
- We can't both go.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:42.791
I've got something to
wrap up here anyway.

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:44.627
Just go after her.

01:32:52.935 --> 01:32:54.269
- You're a good man, Lou.

01:32:54.269 --> 01:32:55.137
- I know!

01:32:56.271 --> 01:32:57.139
Just go!

01:33:03.846 --> 01:33:05.648
- Come on! Come on!

01:33:07.049 --> 01:33:09.251
- Right outside the door now

01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:12.287
and I've run out
of patience to run.

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:17.626
I keep telling myself
that I'll make it.

01:33:18.627 --> 01:33:19.594
Truthfully,

01:33:21.563 --> 01:33:23.899
it's been an honor
and a privilege

01:33:23.899 --> 01:33:27.102
to bring the news
these past 28 years.

01:33:31.573 --> 01:33:32.440
Wow!

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:35.477
Time's flown.

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:39.314
It's all been a laugh.

01:33:44.352 --> 01:33:45.220
Martin,

01:33:47.522 --> 01:33:49.958
if, somehow, you're watching.

01:33:54.429 --> 01:33:55.363
I love you.

01:34:53.121 --> 01:34:54.990
- We're gonna make it.

01:35:00.929 --> 01:35:04.632
Okay, we're not out of
the woods yet, Katya.

01:35:08.403 --> 01:35:09.337
I love you.

01:35:10.605 --> 01:35:12.240
I love you so much.

01:35:13.275 --> 01:35:14.709
- Alex.

01:35:15.677 --> 01:35:17.913
What's the matter?

01:35:17.913 --> 01:35:20.182
- You're bleeding.

01:35:20.182 --> 01:35:22.584
- It's just a scratch.

01:35:26.789 --> 01:35:29.424
- I can't do this on my own.

01:35:29.424 --> 01:35:30.592
- You don't have to.

01:35:30.592 --> 01:35:32.060
I'm not going
anywhere ever again.

01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.896
I swear to God, okay?

01:35:33.896 --> 01:35:35.497
I love you.

01:35:35.497 --> 01:35:36.731
All right?

01:35:36.731 --> 01:35:38.433
This is not the end.

01:35:47.175 --> 01:35:48.043
Katya.

01:36:37.459 --> 01:36:38.326
- No!

01:36:39.000 --> 01:37:12.000
