What'd you do?

00:14.389 --> 00:16.851
What?

00:16.892 --> 00:18.727
Don't give me that.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.727
What'd you do?

00:18.769 --> 00:19.937
Nothing.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.104
Mom, I'm trying

00:19.979 --> 00:21.104
to study.

Oh.

00:22.773 --> 00:26.109

00:22.773 --> 00:26.109

07:41.962 --> 07:43.630
Hello.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.344
And she has your heads where?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.344
Under the couch.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.430
All because Reese

07:49.386 --> 07:51.430
won't admit he did it.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.140
You admit it.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.140
I didn't do it.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.975
Neither did I.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.975
Liar.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.975
FRANCIS: Whoa, wh-whoa.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.435
Chill. You are not gonna

07:55.016 --> 07:56.435
get anywhere

07:56.476 --> 07:57.769
fighting with each other.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.980
Now, first of all,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.980
you all burned the dress.

08:00.021 --> 08:00.981
I didn't.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.023
Hey, you all did it.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.400
You have to stay together.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.525
You have to stay united.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.944
United against who?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.529
My mom.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.529
Nice.

08:08.571 --> 08:09.823
Okay, now, no one broke so far,

08:09.864 --> 08:11.325
so you should be proud

08:09.864 --> 08:11.325
of yourselves.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.118
Did she do the toy thing yet?

08:11.366 --> 08:13.118
Yep.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.535
Spinning?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.535
MALCOLM: Uh-uh.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.745
Okay, good.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.538
I think I know

08:15.787 --> 08:17.538
where she's going.

08:17.580 --> 08:18.915
Separate interviews.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.834
Listen, when she gets you alone,

08:20.875 --> 08:23.337
she's going to pretend

08:20.875 --> 08:23.337
she's on your side.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.422
She's not.

08:26.465 --> 08:27.632
Go ahead.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.218
It's a name brand.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.810
I'm not mad at you.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.479
I know you

08:38.852 --> 08:40.479
didn't do this.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.813
You're a good boy.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.565
But I want you to help

08:41.855 --> 08:44.565
me find out who did.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.567
This is serious.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.778
One of your brothers could

08:46.609 --> 08:48.778
have burned the house down.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.614
And for that, he will

08:48.820 --> 08:51.614
be severely punished.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.285
But the one who helps me

08:51.656 --> 08:55.285
will be a very happy boy.

08:55.327 --> 08:57.829
And I want that

08:55.327 --> 08:57.829
to be you.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.207
'Cause you've always

08:57.871 --> 09:00.207
been the best one.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.210
You've always been

09:01.500 --> 09:03.210
the best one.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.587
You have always

09:03.251 --> 09:06.587
been the best one.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.174
Mom, honestly,

09:06.629 --> 09:09.174
I don't know who did it.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.259
I don't know.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.259
Don't know.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.389
Well, I guess you boys think

09:15.430 --> 09:17.807
you've got your old mom

09:15.430 --> 09:17.807
over a barrel, huh?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.851
Well, we'll just see about that.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.897
If you boys

09:21.061 --> 09:23.897
want to play,

09:23.938 --> 09:28.109
we can play all night long.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
Sir?

09:55.303 --> 09:56.637
Mmm.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.638
Oh.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.558
Thank you.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.851
Oh, can I have another

09:59.599 --> 10:01.851
vodka martini, please?

10:01.893 --> 10:03.353
Very good.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.273
This time, let's go

10:03.395 --> 10:06.273
olive, onion, olive.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.524
Whatever.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.197
(busy signal beeps)

10:16.116 --> 10:18.076
W-What's that? I

10:16.116 --> 10:18.076
can't hear you.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.245
She's killing us!

They tried that psych-ops

10:45.562 --> 10:47.730
stuff on Noriega.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.149
They said that

Oh, your grandmother

11:27.646 --> 11:29.314

are just going to love this

11:30.773 --> 11:33.443
at your next

birthday party.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.528
You're kidding me.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.820
Okay, just

11:34.569 --> 11:35.820
hang in there.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.405
Give me a minute

11:35.862 --> 11:37.405
to think.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.906
Damn, she's good.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.200
Did they crack?

11:40.241 --> 11:42.160
Nah, Dewey faked

11:40.241 --> 11:42.160
a stomach cramp,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.162
bought 'em some time.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.162
Good man.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.665
Man, if we would have had

11:44.204 --> 11:46.665
your mom in 'Nam,

11:46.705 --> 11:49.417
there'd be a McDonald's

11:46.705 --> 11:49.417
in Hanoi Square right now.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.961
Dude, there  is  a McDonald's

11:49.459 --> 11:51.961
in Hanoi Square.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.215
All right.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.467
(busy signal beeps)

12:00.470 --> 12:01.929
Franklin,

12:00.470 --> 12:01.929
I'm ready to order.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.598
Are you sure, sir?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.933
Mm-hmm. See, in our family,

12:03.640 --> 12:05.933
we have a saying.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.395
"After an hour, eat without her.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.813
If it's any longer,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.813
something's wronger."

12:10.855 --> 12:12.399
Very catchy, sir.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.775
Well, when life

12:12.440 --> 12:14.775
gives you lemons,

12:14.817 --> 12:16.444
make lemonade, Franklin.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.029
Do you have any lemonade?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.947
No, sir.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.947
Oh.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.782
You have lemons?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.782
Yes, sir.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.784
Well, throw one

12:21.824 --> 12:23.784
in another martini

12:23.826 --> 12:25.744
and let's hear

12:23.826 --> 12:25.744
those specials.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.792
REESE (whispering):

12:29.832 --> 12:31.792
What's she doing?

12:31.834 --> 12:33.169
Can't tell.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.004
Maybe she left.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.964
Yeah, I'm sure she's gone

12:35.046 --> 12:36.964
out to buy us all presents.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.258
DEWEY:

12:37.006 --> 12:38.258
Hooray.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.635
Man, it's just

12:38.299 --> 12:40.635
too quiet out there.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.303
It's driving me crazy.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.805
Maybe we should sing some more.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.140
Shut up, Dewey.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.027
I wonder how many holes

12:55.149 --> 12:58.027
are up in those tiles.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.238
186,480.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.823
You counted  all  those?

13:02.865 --> 13:06.286
No, you just count one tile's

13:02.865 --> 13:06.286
holes, across and down,

13:06.327 --> 13:09.788
multiply it, then multiply it

13:06.327 --> 13:09.788
again by the number of tiles.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.419
You're doing that more and more.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.420
Doing what?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.631
That brain thing.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.759
Are you just going to keep

13:17.672 --> 13:20.759
getting smarter and weirder?

13:20.799 --> 13:23.052
I don't know.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.887
Well, can you tone it down

13:23.094 --> 13:24.887
a little bit?

13:24.929 --> 13:26.847
'Cause I can't keep up

13:24.929 --> 13:26.847
with all these butt-kickings.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.725
What are you talking about?

13:28.767 --> 13:31.519
Well, at least twice a day

13:28.767 --> 13:31.519
I have to whoop-ass

13:31.561 --> 13:33.313
on some kid

13:31.561 --> 13:33.313
calling you a weirdo.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.022
Honestly, it's exhausting.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.109
You beat up people

13:35.064 --> 13:38.109
'cause they call me a weirdo?

13:38.151 --> 13:40.069
Well, the last kid,

13:38.151 --> 13:40.069
he was a freak anyways.

13:40.111 --> 13:42.821
He was in no position

13:40.111 --> 13:42.821
to throw out names.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.534
Thanks.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.534
For what?

13:47.786 --> 13:49.537
Nothing.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.166
Hey.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.917
What am I thinking right now?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.086
I'm smart; I'm

13:54.959 --> 13:57.086
not psychic.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.298
Can you understand

13:57.128 --> 14:00.298
what dogs are saying?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.382
No.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.509
I can.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.842
LOIS (singsongy):

14:02.550 --> 14:03.842
Oh, boys.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.813
I don't know who put you up to

14:10.933 --> 14:14.813
this sticking-together garbage,

14:14.853 --> 14:16.564
but I don't like it.

14:16.606 --> 14:20.193
Therefore, you have forced me

14:16.606 --> 14:20.193
to do something terrible.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.903
Say good-bye to a cherished

14:20.234 --> 14:22.903
family member.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.991
Who?!

14:23.946 --> 14:26.991
BOYS: No!

14:31.788 --> 14:33.122
BOYS: No!

14:31.788 --> 14:33.122
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.332
Don't you dare.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.792
(knocking on door)

14:36.959 --> 14:39.045
And don't move a muscle.

14:43.675 --> 14:44.925
Hi, Lois.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.386
Look, Ed, uh, it's 9:00.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.928
I'm a little busy right now.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.556
Well, you see,

14:47.970 --> 14:49.556
there's the problem.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.641
It's 9:00 at night, and I

14:49.597 --> 14:51.641
keep hearing screaming.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.934
Now, this didn't sound

14:51.683 --> 14:53.934
like your normal screaming.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.936
It-it was more like

14:53.976 --> 14:55.936
killing-screaming.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.438
I'm not one

14:55.978 --> 14:57.438
to complain...

14:57.480 --> 14:58.857
That's why we like you.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.656
(panting)

15:06.698 --> 15:09.242
In your room...

15:09.283 --> 15:11.703
(distorted):

15:09.283 --> 15:11.703
now.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.582
(whistles)

15:15.623 --> 15:17.250
Nice place

15:15.623 --> 15:17.250
you got here.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.626
Thank you, sir.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.920
I like to create

15:18.668 --> 15:20.920
an atmosphere.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.464
Did you enjoy your meal, sir?

15:23.506 --> 15:25.966
Well, if you can call

15:23.506 --> 15:25.966
four olives, two onions

15:26.008 --> 15:27.968
and a whole lot

15:26.008 --> 15:27.968
of alcohol a meal,

15:28.010 --> 15:29.970
then, yes.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.970
(chuckles)

15:30.012 --> 15:31.972
Very good, sir.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.182
Uh...

15:33.224 --> 15:35.393
What have you got in

15:33.224 --> 15:35.393
the cologne department?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.978
Um, were you looking

15:35.435 --> 15:37.978
for anything in particular?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.899
Well, I've been thinking

15:38.020 --> 15:40.899
about a signature scent.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.899
Uh-huh.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.860
You see, I-I'd like to leave

15:40.940 --> 15:43.860
a room and have people say,

15:43.902 --> 15:45.820
"Boy, smells like

15:43.902 --> 15:45.820
Hal in here."

15:45.862 --> 15:46.987
Mmm?

15:47.029 --> 15:48.989
But in a nice way.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.989
Yeah.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.989
Right.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.075
Uh, let's see... you...

15:52.034 --> 15:53.994
You strike me as a...

15:54.036 --> 15:55.288
sandalwood.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.873
Sandalwood, huh?

15:56.915 --> 15:57.998
Sandalwood.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.959
Let's give it a

15:58.040 --> 15:59.959
smell-see, shall we?

16:02.044 --> 16:03.003
Eh?

16:03.045 --> 16:04.004
Yes.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.256
That's quite nice.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.257
(mumbles)

16:05.298 --> 16:06.257
Hit me.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.008
Here we go.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.008
(laughs)

16:08.050 --> 16:11.011
Oh, that's... that

16:08.050 --> 16:11.011
is quite nice.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.430
Ooh!

16:12.472 --> 16:14.056
You do a service

16:12.472 --> 16:14.056
to your craft, sir.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.267
This man is a genius.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.314
Snooty bastard.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.066
You'd think this place would

16:21.355 --> 16:24.066
be the great equalizer, huh?

16:24.108 --> 16:27.027
You know, even a king

16:24.108 --> 16:27.027
looks like a fool

16:27.069 --> 16:29.029
when he's answering

16:27.069 --> 16:29.029
nature's call, am I right?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.197
Of course I'm right.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.992
Well, it's been

16:30.239 --> 16:32.992
a pleasure.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.036
Oh.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.038
Sorry.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.039
Have a good evening.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.083
Uh, sir?

16:41.125 --> 16:43.169
Yes.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.299
Thank you for making

16:46.088 --> 16:48.299
eye contact with me.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.430
Boys, I just, I don't know

16:51.093 --> 16:54.430
what to do anymore.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.724
I don't want to punish anyone.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.309
All I want is the truth.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.061
I don't know

16:58.351 --> 17:01.061
how things got this far,

17:01.103 --> 17:03.063
but I just want it to stop.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.026
Nah, they'll never buy it.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.083
Oh, my God, Hal.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.087
They saved the TV.

17:27.129 --> 17:28.255
(cheering)

17:28.297 --> 17:30.383
Beautiful work,

17:28.297 --> 17:30.383
beautiful!

17:30.424 --> 17:33.135
You have her exactly where you

17:30.424 --> 17:33.135
want her-- totally crazy.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.095
Now it's time

17:33.177 --> 17:35.095
to take the offensive.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.305
The offensive?

17:36.347 --> 17:37.765
Exactly. She won't...

17:37.807 --> 17:39.141
Wait a minute.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.601
Did you hear breathing?

17:40.643 --> 17:42.562
What?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.564
Mom?

17:52.363 --> 17:54.281
LOIS:

17:52.363 --> 17:54.281
Malcolm.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.784
Would you hang up

17:54.323 --> 17:56.784
the phone, please?

17:56.826 --> 17:57.911
Hi, Mom.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.119
Happy anniversary.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.287
MALCOLM:

17:59.161 --> 18:00.287
Not good. Not good.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.539
What is it? What?!

18:01.581 --> 18:02.832
Mom! Phone!

18:02.874 --> 18:04.333
(Malcolm groans)

18:02.874 --> 18:04.333
Oh! Oh, man. Oh, man.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.585
We're gonna die!

18:05.626 --> 18:06.794
MALCOLM:

18:05.626 --> 18:06.794
That's it.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.713
I got to run away.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.713
Oh. Wait!

18:08.755 --> 18:10.048
We can get

18:08.755 --> 18:10.048
out of this.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.507
You have to use

18:10.089 --> 18:11.507
that brain of yours.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.550
Think.

18:12.592 --> 18:13.593
Think!

18:13.634 --> 18:14.928
All I can think about

18:14.969 --> 18:17.137
is how hard he's

18:14.969 --> 18:17.137
twisting my nipple.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.305
Ow!

18:18.347 --> 18:19.306
Okay.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.267
Think. Think.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.561
I got it.

18:24.645 --> 18:28.190
(laughter)

18:34.072 --> 18:35.531
Mmm, here it is.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.950
That's our song.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.409
Not our song.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.409
No, no, not...

18:38.451 --> 18:39.410
(laughter)

18:39.452 --> 18:41.161
Can I have...?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.914
Another one...

18:44.206 --> 18:46.208
LOIS:

18:44.206 --> 18:46.208
I cannot believe you, Francis.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.627
You think you are so clever

18:47.668 --> 18:49.420
turning them against me,

18:47.668 --> 18:49.420
don't you?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.089
No, Mom.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.840
We did not send you

18:51.130 --> 18:52.840
to Marlin Academy

18:52.882 --> 18:54.467
so that you could undermine

18:52.882 --> 18:54.467
my authority long-distance.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.885
Well, why did you send me?

18:55.927 --> 18:57.595
Well, it-it was not

18:57.637 --> 18:59.179
so that you could undermine

18:57.637 --> 18:59.179
my authority.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.556
And if I am not mistaken,

19:00.598 --> 19:02.475
you are undermining

19:00.598 --> 19:02.475
my authority!

19:02.516 --> 19:04.102
What are you doing?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.394
Y-You're spending

19:04.143 --> 19:05.394
your anniversary at home,

19:05.436 --> 19:06.646
fixating on a stupid dress.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.230
Is that what

19:06.687 --> 19:08.230
you wanted tonight?

19:08.272 --> 19:10.190
What am I supposed to do,

19:08.272 --> 19:10.190
Francis? Let it go?

19:10.232 --> 19:12.026
Yes, that is exactly

19:10.232 --> 19:12.026
what you should do.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.694
Let it go.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.488
But you can't, 'cause you can

19:13.736 --> 19:15.488
never let anything go.

19:15.529 --> 19:19.199
I can, too, let things go.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.200
Fine...

19:19.241 --> 19:20.200
I  can...

19:20.242 --> 19:21.702
Fine.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.702
I can!

19:21.744 --> 19:23.746
Okay, just forget

19:21.744 --> 19:23.746
I said anything.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.208
I cannot talk to you anymore.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.710
Ooh, you make me so mad.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.712
Sometimes I just want

19:29.752 --> 19:31.712
to break your neck.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.380
(sighs) Did you get

19:31.754 --> 19:33.380
the cookies I sent you?

19:33.422 --> 19:34.882
Yeah, they were great.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.425
Good.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.719
(crashing, shattering)

19:50.106 --> 19:54.694
I swear to God, on paper,

19:50.106 --> 19:54.694
this was a great idea.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.949
All right, that's it.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.951
Get dressed--

19:59.991 --> 20:01.951
we're going to dinner.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.411
Oh, my God, it  did  work.

20:04.453 --> 20:05.872
What?

20:05.913 --> 20:07.247
Dinner.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.125
I won't have you boys

20:07.289 --> 20:09.125
starving to death.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.085
Last thing I need is a bunch

20:09.167 --> 20:11.085
of social workers and reporters

20:11.127 --> 20:12.252
tearing up the front lawn.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.421
Now, hurry up before

20:12.294 --> 20:14.421
I change my mind.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.882
What about the dress?

20:16.674 --> 20:19.218
I really liked that dress.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.148
HAL:

20:30.521 --> 20:32.148
Hey, thanks for the ride, Tony.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.774
TONY:

20:32.190 --> 20:33.774
Anytime, Hal!

20:35.193 --> 20:37.236
Hello!

20:39.321 --> 20:41.448
Honey?

20:41.490 --> 20:42.742
Boys?

20:42.783 --> 20:44.785
Anybody home?

20:45.745 --> 20:48.288
Hotcha!

20:48.330 --> 20:51.417
This evening just keeps getting

20:48.330 --> 20:51.417
better and better.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.295
(grunts)

20:55.337 --> 20:56.756
(sighs)

20:59.341 --> 21:01.594
(television playing

20:59.341 --> 21:01.594
in another room)

21:05.765 --> 21:07.307
Hmm.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.574
Oh! No, no.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.785
Okay, okay.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.327
(grunts)

21:25.826 --> 21:27.327
Geez, oh...

21:27.369 --> 21:28.746
Not again.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.289
(toilet flushes)
