<i>come on, everybody</i>.
<i>Put your hands together</i>.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.080
<i>l want to hear y'all scream</i>!

00:28.960 --> 00:32.479
<i>l'm gonna put on my old blue jean</i> s

00:32.520 --> 00:36.520
<i>Gonna walk out of here into the stree</i> t

00:36.560 --> 00:40.760

<i>Would you know the real me</i> ?
<i>Me in my old blue jean</i> s

00:52.640 --> 00:55.400
Thank you! Thank you!

00:55.440 --> 00:56.760
-Where are we?
-Albuquerque.

00:56.800 --> 01:01.560
Albuquerque!
My favourite city in my favourite state...

01:01.600 --> 01:03.160
-Guam.
-Guam!

01:06.720 --> 01:08.240
l hate you.

01:08.760 --> 01:12.040
l love you all! Good night! Toodles!

01:12.080 --> 01:14.200
Get us out of here, Larry!

01:27.600 --> 01:31.480
One of the things l love about this bus,
it brushes for you.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.880
But it could use a bigger sink.

01:48.680 --> 01:50.120
Hey, Lilly.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.320
Yeah, we just left the show
in Albuquerque.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.600
Yes, in New Mexico!
Where else would it be?

01:57.560 --> 01:58.710
Guam?

02:02.040 --> 02:05.430
What? Shut up!

02:06.680 --> 02:08.830
No, you shut up. Oh, my gosh.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.960
Dad, Lilly's got extra tickets
to Maroon 5 tomorrow night!

02:13.000 --> 02:14.720
We got to get home!

02:14.760 --> 02:17.920
Oh, no, but l was kind of hoping
we could take the scenic route.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.160
Maybe stop
and see a couple historical...

02:20.200 --> 02:22.670
-Come on.
-Come on, Daddy.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.560
Not another rock where
Lewis and Clark took a tinkle break.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.000
When l said they were marking
their territory, l meant surveying.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
Dad, call it whatever you want.
lt's boring.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.880
Can we please just go home?

02:36.920 --> 02:39.960
Yeah. Please, please, please, please.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.720
Help me out, Lilly.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.470
-Please, please, please, please!
-<i>Please, please, please, please</i>!

02:45.520 --> 02:50.230
Twenty-one hours of that, Daddy,
in Lilly-Miley Surround Sound.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.920
What do you want to do, Miley?
Just race your way through life,

02:54.960 --> 02:58.960
never taking time to stop along the way
and smell the roses?

02:59.000 --> 03:02.470
Maybe miss some wonderful surprise
that's right in front of you

03:02.520 --> 03:04.960
that could change you forever?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.560
Yep, that's pretty much the plan.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.160
Lilly, save me a ticket.
l'm on my way home.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.840
Lilly, l gotta go.
Apparently, dessert's on me tonight.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.000
Hey, Larry, back up.
She missed a spot!

03:38.960 --> 03:42.040
That's all right, Larry. l got it.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.800
Son, you might wanna
go easy on the makeup.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.360
We're not in Los Angeles yet.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.760
Then why are we stopping?

03:50.800 --> 03:53.520
Because we're at a historical landmark.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.840
Look, it's raining outside, l'm hungry,

03:57.880 --> 04:01.040
and besides that, this diner comes
with one heck of a good story.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.710
And you made me drive right past
the world's largest rubber band ball.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.910
You owe me.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.840
Fine. l know where you can see
the world's biggest pile of dirty socks.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.320
Jackson's room! Let's drive!

04:14.280 --> 04:18.440
And if you're good, l'll let you ride
down the underwear mountain.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.320
Now, l don't want to hear it.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.830
We're gonna stop
and smell the dang roses,

04:24.880 --> 04:26.080
and you're gonna like it!

04:26.120 --> 04:30.120
So clean up your faces,
get off this bus and start sniffing!

04:32.120 --> 04:33.400
Daddy.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.200
<i>come on</i>!

04:40.240 --> 04:44.520
<i>You get the limo out fron</i> t

05:09.760 --> 05:11.680

05:19.520 --> 05:22.760
<i>And you know tha</i> t
<i>it's the best of both world</i> s

05:33.520 --> 05:37.520
Relax, we won't be here
more than a half hour, tops.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.440
Dad, it's gonna take her
a half hour just to get here.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.400
Excuse me. We're ready to order.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.800
Forgot my pen. Back in a jiff.

06:00.840 --> 06:04.040
You just can't find
an old-fashioned hamburger like this

06:04.080 --> 06:05.800
out on the main highway.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.600
lt makes you want to savour every bite.

06:08.920 --> 06:12.800
Yeah, sure. Eating. Savouring. Done.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.160
Let's go.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.160
Come on, Miley. Slow down.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.480
Even your brother's getting
into the spirit of this place.

06:21.520 --> 06:25.400
Prospector Pete found his way
through the maze to the gold.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.440
Again!

06:29.160 --> 06:30.680
Now, about that story.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.680
Twenty years ago,
l walked into this very place

06:33.720 --> 06:36.360
and had an experience
that changed my life.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.200
Let me guess, Daddy,
you saw your first mullet

06:39.240 --> 06:41.840
and knew that was the do for you.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.710
What a great story.
l'm welling up. Let's go.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.880
You know what?

06:46.920 --> 06:49.520
lf you don't want to hear the story,
then l'm not gonna tell it.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.200
You showed us. Let's go.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.390
Okay, if you two are
in such a dang-fired hurry,

06:55.440 --> 06:57.080
then just go out on the bus and wait.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.760
l'm gonna sit here
and enjoy my delicious burger

06:59.800 --> 07:02.240
and think of the memories
of a wonderful story

07:02.280 --> 07:04.880
that you two will never know.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.280
Excuse me, ma'am.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.520
May l have another cup
of your delicious coffee?

07:09.880 --> 07:12.840
You're in luck. l'm brewing a fresh pot.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.350
One,

07:16.880 --> 07:18.110
two...

07:20.000 --> 07:21.800
Time for my break.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.200
Three,

07:33.000 --> 07:34.520
four...

07:35.000 --> 07:37.310
l hope you're happy.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.840
l am.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.240
Hey, Oliver, here's your ticket
for Maroon 5 tonight.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.320
Where's my 50 bucks?

07:52.880 --> 07:54.200
You'll get it.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.040
Right after Rico pays me
for fixing these chairs.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.520
The little genius was gonna pay
a professional 1 00 bucks.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.560
l did it for half,
and all it took was, like, five minutes

08:02.600 --> 08:05.160
and some monster glue.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.120
Who's the genius now?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.510
Looks like it's still Rico.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.870
Would you just give me a hand?

08:21.280 --> 08:23.720
l always wanted to do that.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.800
Now, would you just help me
out of this thing?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.320
You fixed this one too, didn't you?

08:35.960 --> 08:37.880
lt's solid, isn't it?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.320
-Come here.
-No.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.720
Come here. No, l'm not gonna hurt you.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.440
That's what you always say
before you hurt me.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.440
Get over here! Oliver!

08:54.280 --> 08:57.040
Okay, this part, this was not my fault.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.360
That's okay.
What's right in front of you right now?

09:02.400 --> 09:03.720
-A post.
-Good.

09:03.760 --> 09:04.880
No!

09:08.600 --> 09:12.230
He said half an hour,
and he's still not back.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.480
This can only mean one thing.

09:14.520 --> 09:18.800
That meringue-loving hillbilly ordered
a second piece of pie!

09:18.840 --> 09:23.120
l am not going to miss Maroon 5!
Come on, Jackson. Let's go.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.790
You go. l'm about ready
to break my downhill record.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.400
You're about to break something,
all right.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.750
No. No. Wait. lt's too fast.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.680
No, no, no. lt's too fast. lt's too fast!

09:44.960 --> 09:47.430
Awesome! l gotta do that again.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.590
Sorry, buddy, slopes are closed.
Let's go.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.680
And this time, l'm taking off the gloves.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.960
Daddy, l want to go home.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.360
Yep, that ought to get her done.
Let's go.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.950
Miley! Miley. Miley, are you okay?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.800
Next time, you're going first.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.960
That's weird.
What happened to the storm?

10:34.880 --> 10:36.640
What happened to this place?

10:36.680 --> 10:39.280
All righty, hot stuff coming through.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.520
And l'm not talking
about the food, sweet-cakes.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.480
What happened to her?
Where's Daddy?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.750
l don't know. Let's ask Mom.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.480
Shake your tail feathers, college girl,
you've got tables!

10:54.520 --> 10:56.280
Whatever, Loretta.

10:59.680 --> 11:02.960
Come on, there is no way that's Mom.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.400
That's just a girl who looks exactly
like Mom when she was in college.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.400
1 98 7.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.120
l don't know the exact year.

11:13.160 --> 11:17.240
l do. 1 98 7. June 2, to be exact.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.720
Brother in a time warp say what?

11:20.400 --> 11:23.040
The lightning! lt must have zapped us
back in time somehow!

11:23.080 --> 11:26.120
That's crazy,
and l am going to prove it to you.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.680
Excuse me, ma'am,
l'm taking a little survey.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.560
lf you had a daughter,
what would you name her?

11:32.600 --> 11:34.360
-Miley.
-Thank you.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.000
-We're in trouble.
-Yeah. Wow.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.040
-Wow, look at her.
-l know. She's beautiful.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.230
Our mom was totally hot.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.790
And our dad was totally not.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.480
Quick, hide!

11:54.520 --> 11:57.680
Jackson, hello, no reason to hide.
We're not born yet.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.870
Right. Force of habit.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.960
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Sorry, hon, right back.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.400
Oh, man.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.840
Oh, my gosh.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.640
Jackson, this is the story
he wanted to tell us!

12:07.680 --> 12:10.720
The thing that changed his life.
lt was Mom!

12:11.360 --> 12:14.640
We're actually going
to see the moment they met!

12:16.960 --> 12:18.480
Excuse me, miss?

12:18.520 --> 12:21.560
l'm, like, totally lost
and kind of in a hurry.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.080
Which way back to Highway 1 0?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.280
<i>...Egyptia</i> n

12:28.880 --> 12:32.320
Left at the traffic light.
Can't miss it, hunky boy.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.360
Wicked cool, foxy momma.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.680
Wait, where's he going?

12:37.720 --> 12:40.840
Okay, okay, look, don't panic.
He's got to come back, right?

12:40.880 --> 12:44.590
l mean, obviously they met,
or we wouldn't even be here.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.240
Jackson.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.750
Okay, now we can panic.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.880
-Coffee?
-Yeah.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.800
Non-fat vanilla decaf half-caf cap
with just a dollop of foam.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.480
Coffee?

13:10.160 --> 13:11.680
Yes, please.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.350
-There you go.
-Thank you.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.560
No, don't, don't, don't.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.360
-Dad's not going anywhere for a while.
-How do you know?

13:27.400 --> 13:31.800
While he was on the pay phone,
l pulled that out of his car.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.040
l don't know what it is...

13:34.080 --> 13:36.600
Somebody stole my distributor cap!

13:37.720 --> 13:40.600
...but l'm guessing it's a distributor cap.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.920
Frost my applesauce.

13:43.960 --> 13:47.000
l still got two days of driving
to get back to Nashville,

13:47.040 --> 13:50.350
and now l gotta sit here
and waste time waiting on a mechanic.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.710
Are you okay?
Did anything else disappear?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.680
Well, let's just put it this way.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.320
lf l want to drink my coffee,
l have to do it like this.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.440
Why isn't anything happening to you?

14:04.480 --> 14:07.200
l don't know. You're the oldest.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.310
First in, first out.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.880
Well, then, we've got to get them
together before l totally disappear.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.080
Jackson, relax.
They're only a few feet away.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.800
Could l get some coffee, please?

14:18.840 --> 14:20.440
Here it comes.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.080
Sure thing, sugar.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.440
And there it goes.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.240
l am out of here in like 20 minutes,
and then we can totally hit that party.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.800
Awesome!

14:35.040 --> 14:38.240
How are they going to fall in love?
They won't even look at each other.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.640
Jackson, that's it!

14:39.680 --> 14:41.240
Any time Dad talks
about meeting Mom,

14:41.280 --> 14:43.480
he always says that they fell in love

14:43.520 --> 14:46.040
the minute they looked
into each other's eyes.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.800
So all we've got to do
is get them to slow down

14:48.840 --> 14:52.310
and take the time to look at each other.
Oh, boy!

14:52.360 --> 14:53.640
What?

14:55.160 --> 14:57.280
ls there a draught in here?

14:58.120 --> 14:59.680
l was right.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.630
There is no brain in there.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.640
You are so lucky
l'm watering their plants.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.240
Oh, yeah. That's me. Mr Lucky.

15:20.760 --> 15:24.310
Now, can we just get the nail polish
remover and pray it works?

15:24.360 --> 15:26.920
l really don't want to face
the guy at the hardware store

15:26.960 --> 15:30.160
who told me to be careful
with the monster glue.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.350
Okay, nail polish remover
is in Miley's bathroom.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.040
-Why do you get to be in the front?
-'Cause l'm a girl,

15:38.080 --> 15:40.440
and you, me
and the guy at the hardware store

15:40.480 --> 15:42.440
agree that you're an idiot.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.430
-Okay, careful on the stairs.
-Okay. All right.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.240
Steady. Steady.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.240
What, you're not gonna say
''bless you''?

16:10.280 --> 16:12.200
-l'm not feeling it.
-Okay.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.520
So, l would like eggs,
a glass of orange juice,

16:16.560 --> 16:18.630
you to look lovingly
into that man's eyes

16:18.680 --> 16:20.600
and a side of bacon.

16:21.440 --> 16:26.150
Listen, kid, l am 20 minutes away
from a radical party,

16:26.200 --> 16:29.160
so don't harsh my mood
with your 'tude.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.960
Now, where's your momma?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.960
Closer than you think.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.440
Hey, dude. Love the mullet.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.190
Hey, dude. Go away.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.400
Did you check out that waitress?

16:46.440 --> 16:50.040
She's a babe!
And l'm pretty sure she's single!

16:50.720 --> 16:53.030
Listen, kid, l'm kind of working here.

16:53.080 --> 16:57.120
''Don't break my heart,
my itchy twitchy heart.''

16:57.160 --> 16:59.600
No. ''My herky jerky heart.''

17:00.800 --> 17:03.440
You might want to try ''achy breaky''.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.920
And you might want to try
shopping at a men's store.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.270
Achy breaky? That's the dumbest thing
l've ever heard.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.079
Let's get a woman's opinion.
Hey, Mom...

17:13.839 --> 17:18.520
...ma mia!
Mamma mia, she's a cute girl.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.160
Oh, waitress!

17:20.200 --> 17:21.960
Cool your jets. l'm coming.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.560
Where are you going, Dad...

17:23.599 --> 17:24.640
...dio? Daddy-O.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.430
Anywhere that you aren't.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.800
But she's here! Sweet niblets.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.680
Sweet niblets it is.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.080
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.360
What happened?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.040
My butt's gone.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.280
Here. Get up.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.670
Just get them together. Hurry!

17:54.720 --> 17:55.950
Fine.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.680
Well, here are your eggs.
Scrambled. Kind of like you.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.080
This seat's too hard.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.080
Too soft.

18:10.120 --> 18:11.560
Too high.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.200
Too low.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.000
-Too lumpy.
-Too bad.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.160
Now, park it, froggy.
l don't have time for this. l work off tips.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.270
Great, then l've got one for you.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.200
How about this guy?

18:22.240 --> 18:26.440
Business in the front, party in the back!
You got to love that!

18:28.160 --> 18:30.960
Didn't your daddy ever tell you
not to talk to strangers?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.800
-Not yet!
-Well, he should.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.310
First, scarf boy, now you.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.990
l've had about enough of this.
l wish you both would just disappear.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.270
Honey, we're getting there.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.480
Achy breaky heart.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.400
No.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.080
Now, you eat your eggs, and don't
you even think about skipping out.

18:50.120 --> 18:51.560
l've got my eyes on you.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.120
Speaking of eyes,
why don't we go look at mullet man's?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.680
l bet they're gorgeous.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.950
Come on, it'll be fun!

18:57.000 --> 18:59.120
l'm game. How's my hair?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.680
Sweet niblets.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.680
Heck, those are popular today.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.960
Hey, Mel, crack open
another can of niblets!

19:09.760 --> 19:12.960
Come on, Jackson,
we've gotta get them back together.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.880
You're usually good at this.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.120
Sorry, but l'm only half the man
l used to be.

19:19.280 --> 19:23.360
Make that a quarter.
An eighth. A sixteenth.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.080
-Jackson?
-<i>Bye</i>.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.160
Jackson?

19:29.720 --> 19:31.950
l'll miss you, little buddy.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.510
Somebody call for a tow truck?

19:36.560 --> 19:37.880
lt's about time.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.600
No, wait, don't go!

19:40.640 --> 19:41.680
What?

19:41.720 --> 19:44.190
Well, Loretta, that was
my last customer. Toodles.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.600
No! Stop!

19:51.120 --> 19:52.920
What in the world?

19:53.720 --> 19:55.480
Somebody help me!

19:56.280 --> 19:57.600
Not you!

19:59.120 --> 20:01.480
Are you okay, sweet pea?

20:01.520 --> 20:04.040
-You know, she does look a little pale.
-l'll go call a doctor.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.390
No, stop! You can't leave me.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.400
l guess l was just moving so fast

20:11.440 --> 20:14.600
l forgot to see what was
right in front of me.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.240
-What?
-What?

20:16.680 --> 20:18.640
Right in front of me.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.990
Right in front of me!

20:24.200 --> 20:28.240
My, oh, my,
she was right about your eyes.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.440
ls that a Tennessee accent l hear?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.040
Sure enough.

20:34.720 --> 20:36.040
Finally.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.960
Miley. Miley, are you okay?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.630
Jackson! You're okay.

20:47.240 --> 20:50.950
Me? You're the one
who almost just got hit by lightning.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.440
Really?

20:54.760 --> 20:55.910
Wow.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.400
Look, l'm going to get Dad.
Let's get out of here.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.990
Wait, wait, wait. What's your hurry?

21:02.040 --> 21:05.350
l want to hear that story
Daddy was going to tell us.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.920
l have a feeling it's a good one.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.950
l looked into her eyes,
heard that cute Tennessee accent,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.040
and l knew right then she was the one.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.310
-Daddy.
-Yeah.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.600
We sat in this very booth right here
and talked all night.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.880
You know how l knew she loved me?

21:25.920 --> 21:29.080
-She laughed at all your jokes?
-Every one.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.910
Then again, maybe she was just
laughing at my mullet.

21:38.080 --> 21:40.230
Did l mention l hate you?

21:41.680 --> 21:43.520
Thirty-seven times.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.680
lf l miss that Maroon 5 concert,
l swear...

21:47.720 --> 21:49.200
You're not gonna miss it.

21:49.240 --> 21:53.160
Miley said she'd be back.
She'll probably be home any minute.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.790
<i>We're not here. Leave a message</i>.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.230
<i>Lilly, are you ther</i> e
<i>watering the plants</i> ?

22:02.280 --> 22:04.000
