00:02.959 --> 00:06.875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.959 --> 00:06.875
<i>Stardate 41798.2.</i>

00:06.917 --> 00:08.792
<i>We have been ordered</i>

00:06.917 --> 00:08.792
<i>by Starfleet</i>

00:08.834 --> 00:10.792
<i>to proceed</i>

00:08.834 --> 00:10.792
<i>to the Lorenze Cluster</i>

00:10.834 --> 00:12.750
<i>and investigate</i>

00:10.834 --> 00:12.750
<i>the disappearance</i>

00:12.792 --> 00:14.959
<i>of the light cruiser</i>

00:12.792 --> 00:14.959
<i>U.S.S.</i> Drake--

00:15.000 --> 00:16.417
<i>which was in that system</i>

00:16.458 --> 00:18.834
<i>trying to unravel</i>

00:16.458 --> 00:18.834
<i>a mystery of its own</i>

00:18.875 --> 00:21.291
<i>which began when recent</i>

00:18.875 --> 00:21.291
<i>long-range probes</i>

00:21.333 --> 00:24.625
<i>indicated that all intelligent</i>

00:21.333 --> 00:24.625
<i>life on the planet Minos</i>

00:24.667 --> 00:26.834
<i>had disappeared.</i>

00:28.500 --> 00:29.709
Number One?

00:29.750 --> 00:31.750
No help from

00:29.750 --> 00:31.750
the communications log, sir.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.667
The<i> Drake</i> reported

00:31.792 --> 00:33.667
arriving at Minos

00:33.709 --> 00:35.208
and then wasn't

00:33.709 --> 00:35.208
heard from again.

00:35.250 --> 00:36.417
Mr. Data?

00:36.458 --> 00:39.333
The citizens of

00:36.458 --> 00:39.333
Minos gained fame

00:39.375 --> 00:41.750
during the Esalrope Wars

00:39.375 --> 00:41.750
as arms merchants.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.375
They manufactured

00:41.792 --> 00:43.375
sophisticated

00:43.417 --> 00:44.917
and highly-advanced weaponry.

00:44.959 --> 00:46.750
Yeah, for which side?

00:46.792 --> 00:48.417
Both.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.959
We are approaching

00:49.792 --> 00:51.959
the planet Minos, sir.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.917
Standard orbit, Mr. La Forge.

00:53.959 --> 00:55.709
Aye, sir, standard orbit.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.583
Whatever happened to the<i> Drake</i>

00:55.750 --> 00:58.583
happened quickly.

00:58.625 --> 01:01.709
Otherwise a man like Rice

00:58.625 --> 01:01.709
would have reported again.

01:01.750 --> 01:02.917
You know

01:01.750 --> 01:02.917
Captain Rice?

01:02.959 --> 01:04.792
We were

01:02.959 --> 01:04.792
at the academy together.

01:04.834 --> 01:05.875
Tell me about him.

01:05.917 --> 01:07.000
Able, good officer.

01:07.041 --> 01:09.333
How would he react

01:07.041 --> 01:09.333
under stress?

01:09.375 --> 01:11.834
Paul Rice is confident

01:09.375 --> 01:11.834
to the point of arrogance

01:11.875 --> 01:14.458
but he carries it well

01:11.875 --> 01:14.458
because he's usually right.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.583
He's a risk taker.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.542
Really?

01:15.625 --> 01:17.542
I'll give you an example.

01:17.583 --> 01:20.083
One of the final tests

01:17.583 --> 01:20.083
in Advanced Navigation

01:20.125 --> 01:22.709
at the Academy provides

01:20.125 --> 01:22.709
the students with three options.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.208
Rice was given this test

01:24.250 --> 01:26.542
rejected their options,

01:24.250 --> 01:26.542
and offered one of his own.

01:26.583 --> 01:29.125
That's taking a risk.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.125
And it paid off.

01:30.166 --> 01:31.333
He received the top grade

01:31.375 --> 01:33.125
and now that same test

01:31.375 --> 01:33.125
has four options.

01:33.166 --> 01:34.500
In a difficult situation

01:34.542 --> 01:36.834
a man like that would

01:34.542 --> 01:36.834
act aggressively.

01:36.875 --> 01:37.709
Agreed.

01:37.750 --> 01:38.917
WORF:

01:37.750 --> 01:38.917
Commander.

01:38.959 --> 01:40.333
Weren't you offered

01:38.959 --> 01:40.333
the<i> Drake?</i>

01:40.375 --> 01:41.875
Yes.

01:41.917 --> 01:44.375
You gave up your own command

01:41.917 --> 01:44.375
to take this assignment?

01:44.417 --> 01:46.959
At the time I thought

01:44.417 --> 01:46.959
it would be more advantageous

01:47.000 --> 01:48.917
to do a tour

01:47.000 --> 01:48.917
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

01:48.959 --> 01:50.458
DATA:

01:48.959 --> 01:50.458
Captain

01:50.500 --> 01:52.583
readings correspond

01:50.500 --> 01:52.583
with the findings of the probe.

01:52.625 --> 01:53.959
No signs

01:52.625 --> 01:53.959
of intelligent life-forms.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.500
Vegetation and

01:54.000 --> 01:56.500
animal life only.

01:56.542 --> 01:58.959
What happened

01:56.542 --> 01:58.959
to all the people?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.458
War?

02:00.500 --> 02:01.875
Disease?

02:01.917 --> 02:03.875
A dissatisfied customer?

02:03.917 --> 02:07.834
In every war, natural disaster,

02:03.917 --> 02:07.834
even the most virulent plague

02:07.875 --> 02:09.750
there are always survivors.

02:09.792 --> 02:10.875
(<i> beeping</i> )

02:10.917 --> 02:12.750
Captain, we are being hailed.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.375
How can that be, from

02:12.792 --> 02:15.375
a planet with no people?

02:15.417 --> 02:18.417
Your sensors indicated

02:15.417 --> 02:18.417
no intelligent life-forms?

02:18.458 --> 02:19.750
Correct, sir.

02:19.792 --> 02:21.542
Something has scanned

02:19.792 --> 02:21.542
our language banks

02:21.583 --> 02:24.125
and is hailing us.

02:24.166 --> 02:26.250
On main viewer.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.667
(<i> beeping</i> )

02:28.709 --> 02:31.375
Whoever you are,

02:28.709 --> 02:31.375
wherever you're from...

02:31.417 --> 02:32.875
greetings.

02:32.917 --> 02:36.208
Welcome to Minos--

02:32.917 --> 02:36.208
the arsenal of freedom.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.250
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard

02:36.250 --> 02:38.250
of the<i> U.S.S....</i>

02:38.291 --> 02:39.875
If you need

02:38.291 --> 02:39.875
a little something...

02:39.917 --> 02:44.291
special, be it for one target

02:39.917 --> 02:44.291
or multiple targets

02:44.333 --> 02:45.333
we got it.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.333
You'll see it, here on Minos--

02:47.375 --> 02:49.917
where we live by the motto

02:49.959 --> 02:53.417
"peace through superior

02:49.959 --> 02:53.417
firepower."

02:53.458 --> 02:54.875
To whom am I speaking?

02:54.917 --> 02:58.125
To be totally armed

02:54.917 --> 02:58.125
is to be totally secure.

02:58.166 --> 03:03.125
Remember, the early bird

02:58.166 --> 03:03.125
that hesitates gets wormed.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.083
It is a recorded

03:03.166 --> 03:05.083
message, sir.

03:05.125 --> 03:06.083
Minos--

03:06.125 --> 03:07.792
the arsenal of freedom.

03:07.834 --> 03:10.959
Perfection in highly advanced

03:07.834 --> 03:10.959
weaponry.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.333
Versatility, flexibility...

03:12.375 --> 03:13.875
We must have triggered

03:12.375 --> 03:13.875
something

03:13.917 --> 03:15.208
left over

03:13.917 --> 03:15.208
from the Erselrope Wars

03:15.250 --> 03:16.834
when the arms business

03:15.250 --> 03:16.834
was booming.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.083
...guaranteed.

03:18.125 --> 03:21.333
So lock onto my signal,

03:18.125 --> 03:21.333
and beam on down

03:21.375 --> 03:24.000
because we don't just

03:21.375 --> 03:24.000
provide weapons.

03:24.041 --> 03:24.959
Shut that off.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
We provide

03:26.041 --> 03:27.166
complete weapons syst...

03:29.000 --> 03:31.417
That's a heck

03:29.000 --> 03:31.417
of a sales pitch.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.000
If an automatic message system

03:31.458 --> 03:34.000
is still functioning

03:34.041 --> 03:36.000
there could be other systems

03:34.041 --> 03:36.000
on that planet

03:36.041 --> 03:37.125
that are still operational.

03:37.166 --> 03:38.583
Weapons systems?

03:37.166 --> 03:38.583
Possibly.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.125
We're going to have

03:38.625 --> 03:40.125
to go down there to find it.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.000
Number One,

03:40.166 --> 03:42.000
prepare an away team.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.750
Lieutenant Yar,

03:42.041 --> 03:43.750
Data.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.583
Commander, I recommend

03:43.792 --> 03:45.583
a minimum complement.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.041
Oh? I would have

03:45.625 --> 03:47.041
thought otherwise.

03:47.083 --> 03:48.792
We'll keep the first

03:47.083 --> 03:48.792
landing party small

03:48.834 --> 03:51.500
and mobile until I'm confident

03:51.542 --> 03:52.875
whatever killed the inhabitants

03:51.542 --> 03:52.875
of this planet

03:52.917 --> 03:53.917
isn't still down there.

03:53.959 --> 03:55.125
Okay.

04:22.291 --> 04:27.125
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:27.166 --> 04:31.250
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:27.166 --> 04:31.250
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:33.166 --> 04:36.542
<i>to explore</i>

04:33.166 --> 04:36.542
<i>strange new worlds</i>

04:36.583 --> 04:41.542
<i>to seek out new life</i>

04:36.583 --> 04:41.542
<i>and new civilizations</i>

04:41.583 --> 04:47.458
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:41.583 --> 04:47.458
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:48.333 --> 05:50.250
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

05:50.291 --> 05:54.250
<i>I've ordered an away team</i>

05:50.291 --> 05:54.250
<i>to beam down to Minos</i>

05:54.291 --> 05:57.041
<i>to investigate</i>

05:54.291 --> 05:57.041
<i>the disappearance of the</i> Drake.

05:57.083 --> 06:00.041
<i>Although there are no signs</i>

05:57.083 --> 06:00.041
<i>of intelligent life</i>

06:00.083 --> 06:02.500
<i>coming from this</i>

06:00.083 --> 06:02.500
<i>heavily forested planet</i>

06:02.542 --> 06:05.750
<i>I'm far from certain</i>

06:02.542 --> 06:05.750
<i>that it is devoid of danger.</i>

06:13.583 --> 06:15.417
(<i> beeping</i> )

06:15.458 --> 06:16.750
(<i> bird chirping</i> )

06:16.792 --> 06:19.291
Spooky.

06:19.333 --> 06:20.500
Riker.

06:20.542 --> 06:21.917
This is the Bridge.

06:21.959 --> 06:25.500
We'll start a patterned search

06:21.959 --> 06:25.500
from this point.

06:25.542 --> 06:27.250
Keep this channel open.

06:27.291 --> 06:28.709
Aye, sir.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.417
Commander, our communications

06:28.750 --> 06:30.417
are being monitored.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.125
By whom?

06:32.166 --> 06:37.083
Since there is no intelligent

06:32.166 --> 06:37.083
life, the question is by what?

06:37.125 --> 06:38.208
Captain?

06:38.250 --> 06:40.375
Yes, we heard that,

06:38.250 --> 06:40.375
Number One.

06:40.417 --> 06:43.000
We'll try and track it down

06:40.417 --> 06:43.000
from here.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.583
YAR:

07:08.000 --> 07:09.583
Tritanium.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.583
It's melted.

07:10.625 --> 07:11.792
What could do that?

07:11.834 --> 07:13.583
I don't know, but

07:11.834 --> 07:13.583
whatever it was

07:13.625 --> 07:15.000
it's beyond

07:13.625 --> 07:15.000
our technology.

07:15.041 --> 07:16.667
Over here.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.583
Wow.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.792
We've never seen

07:24.625 --> 07:26.792
anything like this.

07:26.834 --> 07:27.834
It's undamaged.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.375
Maybe a

07:27.875 --> 07:29.375
demonstration model

07:29.417 --> 07:31.083
for some

07:29.417 --> 07:31.083
potential buyer.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.792
Maybe.

07:32.834 --> 07:36.000
Let's spread out

07:32.834 --> 07:36.000
a little.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.291
Commander Riker.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.959
This is Ensign T'su.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.709
I am monitoring a slight energy

07:42.000 --> 07:45.709
buildup near your position.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.792
I'm not able to pinpoint

07:45.750 --> 07:47.792
the source.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.291
Give me a direction.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.375
East of your position,

07:49.333 --> 07:52.375
ten meters.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.834
I will continue monitoring.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.166
I can't see anything

07:57.041 --> 07:59.166
through here.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.875
The underbrush is too thick.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.083
Hello.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.166
Commander Riker.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.709
Rice.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.041
Where did you

08:13.041 --> 08:15.041
come from?

08:15.083 --> 08:17.458
I was over there.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.834
We were worried

08:17.500 --> 08:18.834
about you.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.291
I should have known

08:18.875 --> 08:20.291
you'd pop up.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.709
How are you,

08:20.333 --> 08:21.709
Commander Riker?

08:21.750 --> 08:22.667
Me? Forget about me.

08:22.709 --> 08:23.834
What about you?

08:23.875 --> 08:25.792
No word, no message,

08:23.875 --> 08:25.792
nothing.

08:25.834 --> 08:28.542
How many are with you?

08:25.834 --> 08:28.542
There are two others.

08:28.583 --> 08:31.041
Where's the<i> Drake?</i>

08:28.583 --> 08:31.041
Where's your crew?

08:31.083 --> 08:33.417
PICARD:

08:31.083 --> 08:33.417
Number One, a word.

08:33.458 --> 08:37.458
We have some information

08:33.458 --> 08:37.458
you should be aware of.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.792
Ensign T'su?

08:38.834 --> 08:41.792
Sensors indicate

08:38.834 --> 08:41.792
low-level energy readings

08:41.834 --> 08:44.834
but the only life signs

08:41.834 --> 08:44.834
are the away team.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.500
Do you copy,

08:44.875 --> 08:46.500
Number One?

08:47.667 --> 08:49.041
Understood.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.083
You look strange, Paul.

08:59.709 --> 09:01.458
I was injured getting here.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.583
Do you need

09:03.000 --> 09:05.583
medical help?

09:05.625 --> 09:06.583
No.

09:06.625 --> 09:09.375
What's your purpose here?

09:09.417 --> 09:12.291
Commander Data,

09:09.417 --> 09:12.291
Lieutenant Yar.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.750
Sir, other

09:12.333 --> 09:14.750
than ourselves

09:14.792 --> 09:18.000
I am picking up

09:14.792 --> 09:18.000
no life signs here.

09:18.041 --> 09:20.041
I know.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.750
Riker, you didn't answer me.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.667
Who sent you here

09:21.792 --> 09:23.667
to look for me?

09:23.709 --> 09:24.709
Your mother.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.291
She's worried about you.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.834
Tell me about your ship, Riker.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.625
It's the<i> Enterprise,</i>

09:29.875 --> 09:32.625
isn't it?

09:32.667 --> 09:36.750
No, the name of my ship

09:32.667 --> 09:36.750
is the<i> Lollipop.</i>

09:36.792 --> 09:39.542
I have no knowledge

09:36.792 --> 09:39.542
of that ship.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.083
It's just been commissioned.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.083
It's a good ship.

09:42.125 --> 09:44.208
Refresh me, would you, Riker?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.625
What's its size,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.625
its complement?

09:46.667 --> 09:48.792
Who is here with you?

09:48.834 --> 09:51.250
What's the armament

09:48.834 --> 09:51.250
on the<i> Lollipop?</i>

09:51.291 --> 09:54.166
Paul, I will only answer

09:51.291 --> 09:54.166
your questions

09:54.208 --> 09:55.792
if you answer mine.

09:55.834 --> 09:58.208
Why do you want to know

09:55.834 --> 09:58.208
so much about my ship?

09:58.250 --> 10:00.458
We're friends, aren't we?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.500
Old friends.

10:02.542 --> 10:06.125
Our top speed is warp 3,

10:02.542 --> 10:06.125
what's yours?

10:06.166 --> 10:07.458
"Is"?

10:07.500 --> 10:11.166
Then the<i> Drake</i> has not

10:07.500 --> 10:11.166
been destroyed.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.917
The<i> Drake?</i>

10:12.959 --> 10:14.542
Yes, your ship.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.083
Of course.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.083
My ship is the<i> Drake.</i>

10:17.125 --> 10:18.250
Where is it?

10:18.291 --> 10:19.458
Classified.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.667
Classified?

10:20.709 --> 10:21.667
Please.

10:21.709 --> 10:22.875
It's important.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.667
Our survival depends on knowing.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.875
What's the armament

10:24.709 --> 10:26.875
on your ship?

10:26.917 --> 10:29.041
Ten.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.041
Ten?

10:29.083 --> 10:30.792
I don't understand.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.792
Ten what?

10:30.834 --> 10:33.000
Six.

10:33.041 --> 10:36.166
Commander Riker,

10:33.041 --> 10:36.166
your answers make no sense.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.667
You haven't used

10:36.208 --> 10:38.667
my first name once, Paul.

10:38.709 --> 10:40.333
You remember it, don't you?

10:42.375 --> 10:43.583
You don't, do you?

10:43.625 --> 10:45.417
Because you don't exist.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.792
You're a fake.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.500
You're an image of the original,

10:46.834 --> 10:49.500
aren't you?

10:49.542 --> 10:50.750
Answer me!

10:57.375 --> 10:59.083
PICARD:

10:57.375 --> 10:59.083
Report, Number One.

10:59.125 --> 11:01.208
The image of Rice

10:59.125 --> 11:01.208
has been replaced

11:01.250 --> 11:02.834
by something

11:01.250 --> 11:02.834
which is hovering

11:02.875 --> 11:04.250
several meters away.

11:04.291 --> 11:07.250
Number One,

11:04.291 --> 11:07.250
get your team back up here.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.417
Prepare

11:07.291 --> 11:09.417
to beam up.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.458
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

11:11.500 --> 11:12.625
Commander!

11:18.709 --> 11:20.083
What's happened, Number One?

11:20.125 --> 11:22.083
Report.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.125
Report, report!

11:24.166 --> 11:25.583
He can't answer you,

11:24.166 --> 11:25.583
Captain.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.333
Commander Riker

11:25.625 --> 11:27.333
has just been encased

11:27.375 --> 11:29.792
in some kind of

11:27.375 --> 11:29.792
energy field.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.959
Is he alive?

11:33.875 --> 11:35.834
Unknown.

11:41.041 --> 11:42.583
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental.</i>

11:42.625 --> 11:44.750
<i>Some kind of weapon</i>

11:44.792 --> 11:48.291
<i>which, for a time, took</i>

11:44.792 --> 11:48.291
<i>the form of Captain Paul Rice</i>

11:48.333 --> 11:50.959
<i>has enveloped Commander Riker.</i>

11:51.000 --> 11:52.417
Transporter Room 3.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.625
Have you been able to lock on

11:52.458 --> 11:54.625
to the away team?

11:54.667 --> 11:56.834
MAN:

11:54.667 --> 11:56.834
I am unable to lock on

11:54.667 --> 11:56.834
to Commander Riker, sir.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.375
Ensign T'su,

11:56.875 --> 11:58.375
situation report.

11:58.417 --> 12:00.083
Previous energy

11:58.417 --> 12:00.083
readings are gone.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.583
Data, have you been able

12:00.125 --> 12:02.583
to assess

12:02.625 --> 12:04.625
Commander Riker's condition?

12:04.667 --> 12:07.250
DATA:

12:04.667 --> 12:07.250
He appears to be

12:04.667 --> 12:07.250
in some kind of stasis.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.750
Theorize, Mr. Data.

12:08.792 --> 12:12.083
What would be the purpose

12:08.792 --> 12:12.083
of such an encasement?

12:12.125 --> 12:14.291
Typically, the purpose

12:12.125 --> 12:14.291
of such an enclosure

12:14.333 --> 12:16.125
is for storage.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.041
PICARD:

12:16.166 --> 12:18.041
Which would suggest what?

12:18.083 --> 12:19.583
That sooner or later

12:19.625 --> 12:21.792
someone or something

12:19.625 --> 12:21.792
will be along to collect him.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.208
Stand by.

12:21.834 --> 12:23.208
I'm coming down.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.375
You, sir?

12:24.417 --> 12:26.208
Yes. Dr. Crusher,

12:24.417 --> 12:26.208
this is the Captain.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.959
Meet me in

12:26.250 --> 12:27.959
Transporter Room 3.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.083
Mr. La Forge,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.083
you have command of the Bridge.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.208
Aye, sir.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.709
And whatever

12:31.250 --> 12:32.709
happens down there

12:32.750 --> 12:34.250
your prime

12:32.750 --> 12:34.250
responsibility

12:32.750 --> 12:34.250
is to the ship.

12:34.291 --> 12:35.792
Understood, sir.

12:35.834 --> 12:38.834
Captain, I take exception

12:35.834 --> 12:38.834
to your decision to beam down.

12:38.875 --> 12:40.458
Noted.

12:48.208 --> 12:49.792
Is it just Riker?

12:49.834 --> 12:51.750
Yes. Apparently

12:49.834 --> 12:51.750
he's been confined

12:51.792 --> 12:53.583
inside some sort

12:51.792 --> 12:53.583
of force field.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.000
Energize.

13:04.625 --> 13:05.709
Any changes?

13:05.750 --> 13:07.166
Data's figured

13:05.750 --> 13:07.166
out what it is.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.041
Are you getting

13:07.208 --> 13:09.041
any life signs?

13:09.083 --> 13:10.417
He is alive.

13:10.458 --> 13:12.917
What appeared

13:10.458 --> 13:12.917
in the form of

13:10.458 --> 13:12.917
Captain Rice

13:12.959 --> 13:14.291
is an intelligence-

13:12.959 --> 13:14.291
gathering device

13:14.333 --> 13:15.834
used during the

13:14.333 --> 13:15.834
Erselrope Wars.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.709
Probably developed here.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.000
DATA:

13:17.750 --> 13:19.000
It projects an image

13:19.041 --> 13:20.834
of someone the

13:19.041 --> 13:20.834
subject will trust.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.583
Gets as much information

13:20.875 --> 13:22.583
as possible.

13:22.625 --> 13:25.792
If it's found out,

13:22.625 --> 13:25.792
it encases the subject

13:25.834 --> 13:27.792
to await a more detailed

13:25.834 --> 13:27.792
interrogation later.

13:27.834 --> 13:29.041
Clever.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.166
Can you remove it?

13:29.083 --> 13:31.166
DATA: Possibly.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.542
But I will need to know

13:31.208 --> 13:33.542
the exact frequency

13:33.583 --> 13:35.250
and I cannot

13:33.583 --> 13:35.250
determine the risk

13:35.291 --> 13:36.208
to Commander Riker.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.291
(<i> sighs</i> )

13:37.333 --> 13:39.041
We have little choice.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.583
Whatever has him is interrupting

13:39.083 --> 13:41.583
the transporter beam. Remove it.

13:41.625 --> 13:44.250
(<i> high-pitched beeping</i> )

13:44.291 --> 13:46.250
This will take some time, sir.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.959
(<i> electronic tones</i> )

13:56.000 --> 13:57.500
I am picking up

13:56.000 --> 13:57.500
energy readings.

13:57.542 --> 13:58.917
(<i> beep</i> )

13:58.959 --> 14:01.125
Captain,

13:58.959 --> 14:01.125
Lieutenant La Forge here.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.166
Sensors indicate energy readings

14:01.166 --> 14:04.166
in your area.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.625
Doctor,

14:11.083 --> 14:13.625
over here!

14:23.375 --> 14:24.667
(<i> gasping</i> ):

14:23.375 --> 14:24.667
Oh, no...

14:24.709 --> 14:25.583
Doctor!

14:25.625 --> 14:27.166
(<i> both yell</i> )

14:48.250 --> 14:52.625
(<i> moans softly</i> )

14:52.667 --> 14:54.875
(<i> Picard coughing</i> )

14:56.333 --> 14:59.083
Doctor!

15:03.166 --> 15:06.583
(<i> gasping</i> )

15:11.333 --> 15:13.166
This one is different.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.959
It's anticipating.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.375
Data, I need you.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.875
Set your phaser on kill.

15:23.917 --> 15:25.166
I'll lead left,

15:23.917 --> 15:25.166
you get it.

15:32.458 --> 15:34.000
Captain!

15:35.458 --> 15:37.375
Dr. Crusher?

15:37.417 --> 15:39.959
Captain Picard.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.125
I have a malfunction.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.792
<i>Enterprise,</i> this is Yar.

15:42.834 --> 15:43.917
Mine's out, too.

15:43.959 --> 15:46.041
The close pass

15:43.959 --> 15:46.041
by the weapons

15:46.083 --> 15:47.458
must have disrupted

15:46.083 --> 15:47.458
our communicators.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.709
Keep on working.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.166
I'll look for the Captain

15:48.750 --> 15:50.166
and Dr. Crusher.

15:54.375 --> 15:56.125
Ow, my arm!

15:59.458 --> 16:02.709
How bad is it?

16:02.750 --> 16:03.792
(<i> groans</i> )

16:03.834 --> 16:06.291
It's bad.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.041
(<i> panting</i> )

16:08.083 --> 16:09.041
Hey, come on.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.250
Come on.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.083
All right, d-don't worry.

16:14.125 --> 16:16.166
We'll get you out of here.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.875
<i>Enterprise,</i>

16:16.208 --> 16:17.875
this is the Captain.

16:17.917 --> 16:19.375
Two to beam up.

16:19.417 --> 16:20.625
Oh...<i> </i>

16:19.417 --> 16:20.625
<i>Enterprise!</i>

16:22.834 --> 16:24.250
<i>Enterprise,</i> come in.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.667
Data, Lieutenant Yar.

16:27.709 --> 16:28.792
What's wrong?

16:28.834 --> 16:30.166
Why aren't

16:28.834 --> 16:30.166
they working?

16:30.208 --> 16:31.166
I don't know.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.166
But don't worry.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.959
As soon as they realize

16:34.000 --> 16:36.500
that our communicators

16:34.000 --> 16:36.500
are not working

16:36.542 --> 16:39.667
th-their sensors will find us,

16:36.542 --> 16:39.667
and Geordi will beam us up.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.083
Now, just you hold on.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.125
Uh...

16:45.166 --> 16:46.625
I'm, uh, sorry about this.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.834
(<i> cloth ripping</i> )

16:53.458 --> 16:55.166
Hold on.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.917
It won't be long.

17:01.208 --> 17:05.542
I must keep conscious.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.792
I can't find them.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.083
Step back, please.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.041
I believe I have found it.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.667
Data.

17:28.834 --> 17:31.375
All vital signs

17:28.834 --> 17:31.375

17:31.417 --> 17:32.500
Good.

17:32.542 --> 17:34.542
Now Geordi can get us

17:32.542 --> 17:34.542
out of here.

17:34.583 --> 17:35.792
Come on.

17:35.834 --> 17:37.375
The Captain

17:35.834 --> 17:37.375

17:37.417 --> 17:39.291

17:41.625 --> 17:43.041

17:43.083 --> 17:45.542
All five members

17:43.083 --> 17:45.542
of the away team.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.625
Good. They must have freed

17:45.583 --> 17:47.625
Commander Riker.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.041
Transporter Room

17:49.083 --> 17:51.709
get a lock on the away team,

17:49.083 --> 17:51.709
and beam them up.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.083
Shields just came on.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.792
Deflectors also up.

17:54.834 --> 17:57.750
I'm picking up an object

17:54.834 --> 17:57.750
off the port bow.

17:57.792 --> 17:58.917
It's firing.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.709

18:04.750 --> 18:07.083

18:09.083 --> 18:10.917
We can't beam the away team up

Photon torpedoes standing by.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.166
Locking on target.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.333
Correction...

18:17.375 --> 18:19.166
target has disappeared.

18:19.208 --> 18:20.208
Give me a full scan.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.375

18:21.417 --> 18:24.000
No readings yet.

18:24.041 --> 18:26.375
Wait. Something dead astern.

Emergency power to shields.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.250
Object is firing.

18:30.291 --> 18:31.417
Return fire.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.000
No use.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.000
It's gone again.

18:34.041 --> 18:35.458
Aft shields weakened.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.834
Whatever they're using

18:36.875 --> 18:39.000
our shields can't stand up to it

18:36.875 --> 18:39.000
much longer.

18:39.041 --> 18:40.375
This is Chief Engineer Logan.

18:40.417 --> 18:43.750
Are we breaking orbit?

18:40.417 --> 18:43.750
I need to know, now!

19:04.458 --> 19:05.542
Why are we

19:04.458 --> 19:05.542
still in orbit?

19:05.583 --> 19:06.917
We're taking

19:05.583 --> 19:06.917
a beating.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.709
We've<i> got</i> to hold out

19:06.959 --> 19:08.709
as long as we can.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.375
Now, if can disable

19:08.750 --> 19:10.375
our attacker

19:10.417 --> 19:12.875
if only for a few seconds,

19:10.417 --> 19:12.875
we can drop our shields

19:12.917 --> 19:14.542
and beam the away team

19:12.917 --> 19:14.542
back aboard.

19:14.583 --> 19:17.959
If we follow that plan,

19:14.583 --> 19:17.959
we'll lose the<i> Enterprise.</i>

19:18.000 --> 19:20.208
In view of the

19:18.000 --> 19:20.208
present crisis

19:20.250 --> 19:22.542
I believe you should

19:20.250 --> 19:22.542
relinquish command to me.

19:22.583 --> 19:23.542
No.

19:23.583 --> 19:24.834
I outrank you.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.834
Mr. Logan, I'm in command.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.375
The Captain did not anticipate

19:29.417 --> 19:31.542
the<i> Enterprise</i>

19:29.417 --> 19:31.542
would come under attack.

19:31.583 --> 19:34.417
If he had, would he have

19:31.583 --> 19:34.417
left the Bridge to you?

19:34.458 --> 19:36.667
If he had,

19:34.458 --> 19:36.667
he wouldn't have left the<i> ship!</i>

19:36.709 --> 19:38.500
Picking up an object

19:36.709 --> 19:38.500
to starboard, sir

19:38.542 --> 19:39.500
heading toward us.

19:39.542 --> 19:40.667
Lock phasers

19:39.542 --> 19:40.667
on that thing

19:40.709 --> 19:42.250
and fire the moment

19:40.709 --> 19:42.250
it's in range.

19:42.291 --> 19:44.458
Locking in.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.875
The object has vanished.

19:53.625 --> 19:55.291
Phaser lock lost.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.166
Starboard shields weakened.

19:57.208 --> 19:58.458
It's cloaked itself.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.333
You can't fight this thing

19:58.500 --> 20:00.333
and win.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.917
We've got to break orbit, now!

20:01.959 --> 20:03.583
Worf...

20:03.625 --> 20:06.333
analyze its firing pattern.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.667
Maybe we can anticipate

20:06.375 --> 20:09.667
its location.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.709
Aye.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.000
Solis...

20:12.041 --> 20:13.917
correlate the trajectory

20:12.041 --> 20:13.917
of the energy bolts

20:13.959 --> 20:15.250
with the attack path.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.166
I'll compute

20:15.291 --> 20:17.166
the optimum spread of phaser

20:17.208 --> 20:18.542
and photon torpedoes to hit it.

20:18.583 --> 20:19.625
Right!

20:19.667 --> 20:21.709
Lieutenant

20:19.667 --> 20:21.709
La Forge...

20:21.750 --> 20:24.083
Geordi...

20:24.125 --> 20:26.792
I know you want to do what's

20:24.125 --> 20:26.792
best for the<i> Enterprise.</i>

20:26.834 --> 20:29.333
So do I.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.333
Now, the best thing...

20:29.375 --> 20:32.375
The best thing, Mr. Logan,

20:29.375 --> 20:32.375
is for this discussion to end

20:32.417 --> 20:34.291
and for you to return

20:32.417 --> 20:34.291
to your duties.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.000
Now, I'm in charge

20:34.333 --> 20:36.000
until relieved

20:36.041 --> 20:37.875
by Commander Riker

20:36.041 --> 20:37.875
or Captain Picard.

20:37.917 --> 20:40.333
You're ignoring

20:37.917 --> 20:40.333
my greater rank

20:37.917 --> 20:40.333
and experience.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.000
Not at all.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.250
In fact, just the opposite.

20:43.291 --> 20:44.667
I'm counting on it.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.458
Now, I need you to get

20:44.709 --> 20:46.458
back down to Engineering

20:46.500 --> 20:47.917
and get me every

20:46.500 --> 20:47.917
available scrap

20:47.959 --> 20:49.333
of emergency power you can.

20:49.375 --> 20:50.959
The more power we can

20:49.375 --> 20:50.959
channel to the shields

20:51.000 --> 20:53.417
the longer we'll be able

20:51.000 --> 20:53.417
to hold out.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.458
<i>Now,</i> Mr. Logan.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.417
(<i> sighs</i> )

21:08.458 --> 21:11.500
Worf, have you got

21:08.458 --> 21:11.500
a lock on it yet?

21:11.542 --> 21:14.375
It's impossible

21:11.542 --> 21:14.375
to be sure.

21:21.125 --> 21:22.709
Maybe you should wait here

21:22.750 --> 21:25.834
while Data and I search

21:22.750 --> 21:25.834
for the Captain and Dr. Crusher.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.208
Nah, I'm a

21:25.875 --> 21:27.208
little groggy

21:27.250 --> 21:28.333
but I'll be

21:27.250 --> 21:28.333
all right.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.083
I am getting

21:28.375 --> 21:30.083
energy readings...

21:31.583 --> 21:32.709
Look out!

21:40.667 --> 21:44.041
We'll do it

21:40.667 --> 21:44.041
just like before.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.875
It's got a deflector shield.

21:56.917 --> 21:59.709
The product continues

21:56.917 --> 21:59.709
to upgrade and improve.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.375
We'll concentrate our fire

21:59.750 --> 22:02.375
and try to collapse its shield.

22:02.417 --> 22:05.125
Commander,

22:02.417 --> 22:05.125
we'll need you, too.

22:08.875 --> 22:09.959
Now!

22:23.250 --> 22:25.834
You're right.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.834
They keep on getting better.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.375
The weapons

22:25.875 --> 22:27.375
are appearing

22:27.417 --> 22:30.000
at intervals of

22:27.417 --> 22:30.000
precisely 12 minutes.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.417
Well, this one took

22:30.041 --> 22:32.417
everything we had.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.208
I don't know how

22:32.458 --> 22:34.208
we'll handle the next one.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.792
We're not going

22:34.250 --> 22:35.792
to wait around.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.542
Let's find

22:35.834 --> 22:37.542
the rest of our team.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.542
That's an order.

23:06.583 --> 23:09.375
I must have lost

23:06.583 --> 23:09.375
a lot of blood.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.291
I stopped the bleeding.

23:13.333 --> 23:16.291
No, there's

23:13.333 --> 23:16.291
another wound.

23:27.542 --> 23:30.792
to be fine.

23:30.834 --> 23:34.458
Now... this is going

23:30.834 --> 23:34.458
to hurt a bit.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.792
I've heard that before.

23:49.709 --> 23:50.750
What do I do next?

23:50.792 --> 23:52.458
Doctor.

23:52.500 --> 23:57.625
Uh... the wound needs

23:52.500 --> 23:57.625
a clotting agent.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.792
I couldn't find

23:57.667 --> 23:59.792
your medical kit.

24:02.125 --> 24:04.333
Those roots... what are they?

Roots?

24:05.375 --> 24:07.291
What, these?

24:09.041 --> 24:11.208
Break off a piece

24:09.041 --> 24:11.208
and taste it.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.750
Don't swallow it.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.709
Very bitter.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.583
Apply some to your hand.

24:30.667 --> 24:32.583
It's-It's turning yellowish.

24:32.625 --> 24:38.208
Good. Now, spread as much of it

24:32.625 --> 24:38.208
as you can onto the wound.

24:46.375 --> 24:47.417

The patient's going into shock.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.667
So what do I do?

25:11.709 --> 25:16.667
Elevate the legs,

No.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.291
All right

26:09.333 --> 26:11.542
I know it's risky

26:11.583 --> 26:14.417
but a shot in the dark

26:11.583 --> 26:14.417
is better than nothing.

26:14.458 --> 26:17.750
Let's see

26:14.458 --> 26:17.750
if we can get lucky.

26:17.792 --> 26:21.709
I can't seem

26:17.792 --> 26:21.709
to pin down

26:17.792 --> 26:21.709
the pattern.

26:22.875 --> 26:23.959
(<i> beeping</i> )

26:24.000 --> 26:24.917
There.

26:24.959 --> 26:25.917
Sorry, sir.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.000
I should have

26:25.959 --> 26:27.000
seen that.

26:27.041 --> 26:28.000
No, that's all right.

26:28.041 --> 26:29.000
You're doing fine.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.208
WORF:

26:29.041 --> 26:30.208
Program laid in.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.250
Phasers and photon torpedoes

26:30.250 --> 26:32.250
ready.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.750
Okay.

26:34.792 --> 26:40.542
Mr. Solis, bring her about

26:34.792 --> 26:40.542
to 23, mark 185.

26:40.583 --> 26:42.875
Aye, sir.

26:47.917 --> 26:49.417
Fire!

26:49.458 --> 26:50.583
Now!

26:50.625 --> 26:51.959
Phasers and photons firing.

26:57.834 --> 26:59.959
We<i> missed!</i>

27:00.000 --> 27:01.375
Number 4 shield

27:00.000 --> 27:01.375
buckling.

27:03.625 --> 27:05.166
Number 3 shield nearing failure.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.834
LOGAN:

27:05.208 --> 27:06.834
Bridge, this is Engineering.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.917
I can't hold this power level

27:06.875 --> 27:08.917
much longer.

27:08.959 --> 27:10.542
You've got to<i> do</i> something!

27:10.583 --> 27:12.500
Backup systems

27:10.583 --> 27:12.500
are overloaded.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.458
Backup systems failing!

27:14.500 --> 27:15.917
LOGAN:

27:14.500 --> 27:15.917
La Forge!

27:15.959 --> 27:17.959
This is Logan.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.417
Tell me something.

27:23.458 --> 27:27.458
Mr. Logan, report to the Bridge.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.291
On my way.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.041
Deflectors are

27:46.667 --> 27:48.041
breaking down.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.083
We have less than

27:48.083 --> 27:51.083
one minute of reserve.

27:51.125 --> 27:53.583
We're getting

27:51.125 --> 27:53.583
out of here.

27:53.625 --> 27:58.125
Lieutenant Solis,

27:53.625 --> 27:58.125
set course 315,

27:53.625 --> 27:58.125
mark 007.

27:58.166 --> 28:00.125
Course set.

28:00.166 --> 28:01.583
You are leaving them

28:00.166 --> 28:01.583
on the planet.

28:01.625 --> 28:02.875
Speed, warp 5.

28:02.917 --> 28:05.166
Warp 5. Aye.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.208
Engage.

28:28.667 --> 28:32.166
Hold course and speed

28:28.667 --> 28:32.166
for 28 seconds

28:32.208 --> 28:34.583
then come to a full stop.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.917
Mr. Logan...

28:36.959 --> 28:39.250
had we stayed,

28:36.959 --> 28:39.250
we would have been destroyed

28:39.291 --> 28:41.000
and there are over

28:39.291 --> 28:41.000
a thousand people on this ship.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.583
I have a responsibility

28:41.041 --> 28:42.583
to them.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.041
What about your

28:42.625 --> 28:44.041
responsibility

28:44.083 --> 28:45.125
to Captain Picard

28:44.083 --> 28:45.125
and the members

28:45.166 --> 28:46.417
of the away team?

28:46.458 --> 28:49.875
I have a responsibility

28:46.458 --> 28:49.875
to them, as well.

28:49.917 --> 28:53.834
Mr. Logan, you are going

28:49.917 --> 28:53.834
to take command...

28:54.917 --> 28:57.083
...of the Saucer Section.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.917
Back up crew,

28:57.125 --> 28:59.917
report to the Main Bridge.

28:59.959 --> 29:01.250
We're going to separate?

29:01.291 --> 29:03.125
Yes, and I want you

29:01.291 --> 29:03.125
to take the Saucer Section

29:03.166 --> 29:04.875
and proceed immediately

29:03.166 --> 29:04.875
to Starbase 103.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.166
You can't fight

29:04.917 --> 29:07.166
what you can't see.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.500
And you still won't be

29:07.208 --> 29:09.500
able to see that thing.

29:09.542 --> 29:10.834
Maybe we won't have to.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.041
Risky.

29:12.083 --> 29:15.166
Yes. That's why

29:12.083 --> 29:15.166
we're going to separate.

29:15.208 --> 29:17.333
Worf, Solis, T'su...

29:17.375 --> 29:18.834
report to the Battle Bridge.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.125
I'll join you in a moment.

29:20.166 --> 29:21.834
WORF:

29:20.166 --> 29:21.834
Ensign, secure

29:20.166 --> 29:21.834
connector levels.

29:21.875 --> 29:24.083
MAN:

29:21.875 --> 29:24.083
Aye, sir.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.208
(<i> door chimes</i> )

29:46.250 --> 29:47.583
Come in.

29:51.542 --> 29:55.250
Lieutenant, I need

29:51.542 --> 29:55.250
to speak to you.

29:55.291 --> 29:56.750
Counselor,

29:55.291 --> 29:56.750
we're a few minutes away

29:56.792 --> 29:58.333
from separating

29:56.792 --> 29:58.333
the battle section.

29:58.375 --> 29:59.333
I don't have a lot of time.

29:59.375 --> 30:01.125
I know,

29:59.375 --> 30:01.125
but as counselor

30:01.166 --> 30:03.041
I have a duty

30:01.166 --> 30:03.041
to evaluate

30:03.083 --> 30:05.500
the emotional

30:03.083 --> 30:05.500
fitness of the crew.

30:05.542 --> 30:10.000
And you sense I'm nervous?

30:10.041 --> 30:11.417
Well, you're right.

30:11.458 --> 30:15.333
Counselor, deep down,

30:11.458 --> 30:15.333
I'm shaking.

30:15.375 --> 30:17.166
I'm about to take

30:15.375 --> 30:17.166
this ship into battle

30:17.208 --> 30:18.500
and-and there's a good chance

30:18.542 --> 30:20.250
she'll be blasted

30:18.542 --> 30:20.250
out of the sky.

30:20.291 --> 30:21.917
I'm taking

30:20.291 --> 30:21.917
a huge risk here

30:21.959 --> 30:24.291
and there are

30:21.959 --> 30:24.291
a lot of lives at stake.

30:24.333 --> 30:27.291
So, yeah, I'm nervous.

30:27.333 --> 30:28.792
Did you expect otherwise?

30:28.834 --> 30:29.917
Not at all.

30:29.959 --> 30:31.500
You're under

30:29.959 --> 30:31.500
tremendous pressure

30:31.542 --> 30:33.291
more than you've

30:31.542 --> 30:33.291
ever experienced.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.083
And you think

30:33.333 --> 30:35.083
I'm about to crack?

30:35.125 --> 30:37.250
On the contrary,

30:35.125 --> 30:37.250
you should be proud

30:37.291 --> 30:39.166
of the way

30:37.291 --> 30:39.166
you're handling command.

30:39.208 --> 30:42.333
You've kept a cool

30:39.208 --> 30:42.333
head, taken charge

30:42.375 --> 30:44.792
and made some very

30:42.375 --> 30:44.792
difficult decisions.

30:44.834 --> 30:46.291
Then what did you want

30:44.834 --> 30:46.291
to see me about?

30:46.333 --> 30:48.083
SOLIS:

30:46.333 --> 30:48.083
Lieutenant La Forge

30:48.125 --> 30:50.375
Battle Bridge

30:48.125 --> 30:50.375
is manned and ready.

30:50.417 --> 30:53.542
However, deflectors have not yet

30:50.417 --> 30:53.542
returned to full efficiency.

30:53.583 --> 30:56.208
Let's get them there,

30:53.583 --> 30:56.208
Mr. Solis.

30:56.250 --> 30:57.417
Aye, sir.

30:57.458 --> 30:58.542
I'll join you shortly.

30:58.583 --> 30:59.959
La Forge out.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.583
Did you hear the

31:00.000 --> 31:03.583
uneasiness in his voice?

31:03.625 --> 31:05.792
Solis is doing a fine job.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.458
Yes, but he isn't

31:05.834 --> 31:07.458
handling the stress

31:07.500 --> 31:08.792
as well as you are.

31:08.834 --> 31:10.750
Both he and Ensign T'su

31:08.834 --> 31:10.750
are very young.

31:10.792 --> 31:12.583
No, wait.

31:10.792 --> 31:12.583
They're good officers.

31:12.625 --> 31:15.125
Yes, but they lack

31:12.625 --> 31:15.125
battle experience.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.291
They're worried

31:15.166 --> 31:17.291
about making mistakes

31:17.333 --> 31:19.417
and they need

31:17.333 --> 31:19.417
some encouragement.

31:19.458 --> 31:21.917
What do I do?

31:21.959 --> 31:26.583
Just remember, it's<i> you</i>

31:21.959 --> 31:26.583
they draw strength from.

31:26.625 --> 31:30.250
They look to you

31:26.625 --> 31:30.250
for guidance and

31:26.625 --> 31:30.250
for leadership.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.625
Help them.

31:35.667 --> 31:38.625
Show confidence in them.

31:38.667 --> 31:42.709
Like Captain Picard

31:38.667 --> 31:42.709
showed confidence in me.

31:42.750 --> 31:43.875
Right.

31:43.917 --> 31:45.333
(<i> sighing</i> )

31:45.375 --> 31:46.458
I understand.

31:46.500 --> 31:48.375
Thanks, Counselor.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.208
Prepare to initiate

32:01.500 --> 32:04.208
separation sequence.

32:04.250 --> 32:06.333
All decks

32:04.250 --> 32:06.333
report ready.

32:06.375 --> 32:08.125
On my mark.

32:16.250 --> 32:17.375
Now.

32:30.417 --> 32:33.458
COMPUTER:

32:30.417 --> 32:33.458
Main-latch mags to zero.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.917
Main-latch retraction, 1 to 18.

32:36.959 --> 32:37.959
Initiate.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
Static charge, compensated.

32:48.041 --> 32:49.625
Separation complete.

32:49.667 --> 32:50.917
Lieutenant Solis

32:50.959 --> 32:54.500
lay in a reciprocal course

32:50.959 --> 32:54.500
for Minos, warp 5.

32:54.542 --> 32:55.583
Course set.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.166
On my mark.

32:58.208 --> 33:00.250
Engage.

33:12.208 --> 33:16.166
We seem to be pretty well

33:12.208 --> 33:16.166
sealed in, Doctor.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.083
No exits?

33:18.125 --> 33:19.834
None that

33:18.125 --> 33:19.834
I can see.

33:19.875 --> 33:22.917
If you find one, go.

33:22.959 --> 33:27.000
Uh-huh, tired

33:22.959 --> 33:27.000
of my company already?

33:27.041 --> 33:29.208
Beverly?

33:29.250 --> 33:30.792
Beverly?!

33:30.834 --> 33:34.291
I'm tired.

33:30.834 --> 33:34.291
I need to sleep.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.792
Woke up too early.

33:36.834 --> 33:37.917
Talk to me.

33:36.834 --> 33:37.917
Stay awake.

33:37.959 --> 33:39.834
Tell me something.

33:39.875 --> 33:42.041
Tell me about, uh...

33:39.875 --> 33:42.041
about those roots.

33:42.083 --> 33:44.834
How did you know

33:42.083 --> 33:44.834
their medicinal values?

33:44.875 --> 33:46.417
My grandmother.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.709
Your grandmother was a doctor?

33:48.750 --> 33:50.291
No.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.000
Oh, she was a

33:50.333 --> 33:52.000
botanist then?

33:52.041 --> 33:54.959
Uh... no.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
She helped to colonize

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
Arvada III.

33:58.041 --> 34:01.458
Arvada III?

34:01.500 --> 34:04.583
That's such a tragedy.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.583
Did she survive?

34:04.625 --> 34:07.250
Yes.

34:07.291 --> 34:10.792
Once the medical supplies

34:07.291 --> 34:10.792
had run out

34:10.834 --> 34:13.709
she had to use what was at hand.

34:13.750 --> 34:17.417
So she learned

34:13.750 --> 34:17.417
all about roots and herbs

34:17.458 --> 34:20.083
and then

34:17.458 --> 34:20.083
taught it to me.

34:20.125 --> 34:23.125
You were part of that colony.

34:20.125 --> 34:23.125
I didn't know that.

34:23.166 --> 34:26.250
But then there must be

34:23.166 --> 34:26.250
a lot of things about you

34:26.291 --> 34:27.291
that I don't know.

34:27.333 --> 34:30.417
Quite a few.

34:30.458 --> 34:31.792
What?

34:31.834 --> 34:35.166
Now, just a minute,

34:31.834 --> 34:35.166
here's something odd.

34:35.208 --> 34:37.333
It's glowing.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.291
What is it?

34:38.333 --> 34:39.750
I don't know.

34:39.792 --> 34:41.250
It's... it's covered up.

34:41.291 --> 34:45.125
Just... just clearing away

34:41.291 --> 34:45.125
the dirt.

34:45.166 --> 34:48.166
It's a viewscreen.

34:51.417 --> 34:56.333
It seems to

34:51.417 --> 34:56.333
still be

34:51.417 --> 34:56.333
operative.

35:01.917 --> 35:04.291
(<i> buzzing, beeps</i> )

35:04.333 --> 35:08.291
(<i> startup whirring</i> )

35:08.333 --> 35:09.834
(<i> electronic humming</i> )

35:09.875 --> 35:12.250
It's a tracking device

35:09.875 --> 35:12.250
of some kind.

35:12.291 --> 35:14.125
Tracking what?

35:14.166 --> 35:17.208
There are three

35:14.166 --> 35:17.208
moving indicators.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.208
Possibly the away team.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.959
Beautiful, isn't it?

35:26.000 --> 35:28.625
It's the centerpiece

35:26.000 --> 35:28.625
of the whole unit.

35:28.667 --> 35:30.667
Who's that?

35:33.000 --> 35:34.542
A projection.

35:34.583 --> 35:36.083
It's the automated

35:34.583 --> 35:36.083
salesman

35:36.125 --> 35:38.250
who greeted us

35:36.125 --> 35:38.250
on the<i> Enterprise.</i>

35:38.291 --> 35:39.458
What unit?

35:39.500 --> 35:41.750
Why, the Echo Papa 607--

35:41.792 --> 35:43.875
our proudest achievement.

35:43.917 --> 35:46.959
The ultimate

35:43.917 --> 35:46.959
in weapons system technology.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.166
Is that what's behind

35:47.000 --> 35:50.166
the attack on my people?

35:50.208 --> 35:53.125
Impressive demonstration,

35:50.208 --> 35:53.125
isn't it?

35:53.166 --> 35:55.709
Demonstration?

35:53.166 --> 35:55.709
It tried to kill us.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.458
Versatile, powerful,

35:55.750 --> 35:58.458
and easy to use.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.083
The 607

35:58.500 --> 36:00.083
does it all.

36:00.125 --> 36:02.333
Its various modules

36:02.375 --> 36:06.250
can gather information,

36:02.375 --> 36:06.250
neutralize ground personnel

36:06.291 --> 36:09.083
even destroy

36:06.291 --> 36:09.083
enemy space vessels.

36:09.125 --> 36:12.291
The<i> Enterprise.</i>

36:12.333 --> 36:14.583
Is one of those things

36:12.333 --> 36:14.583
after my ship?

36:14.625 --> 36:15.792
Tell me.

36:15.834 --> 36:17.166
Of course I can tell you.

36:17.208 --> 36:19.959
I am programmed to answer

36:17.208 --> 36:19.959
any and all questions

36:20.000 --> 36:21.166
about the unit.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.458
I can talk terms,

36:21.208 --> 36:23.458
arrange for delivery--

36:23.500 --> 36:25.166
whatever you need.

36:25.208 --> 36:29.083
It doesn't understand anything

36:25.208 --> 36:29.083
other than what it's peddling.

36:29.125 --> 36:31.834
The 607 represents

36:29.125 --> 36:31.834
the state of the art

36:31.875 --> 36:33.917
in dynamic adaptive design.

36:33.959 --> 36:37.834
It learns from each encounter

36:33.959 --> 36:37.834
and improves itself.

36:37.875 --> 36:40.083
So what went wrong?

36:37.875 --> 36:40.083
Where are its creators?

36:40.125 --> 36:41.667
Where are the people of Minos?

36:41.709 --> 36:44.875
Once unleashed,

36:41.709 --> 36:44.875
the unit is invincible.

36:44.917 --> 36:47.291
The perfect killing system.

36:47.333 --> 36:50.875
Too perfect.

36:50.917 --> 36:54.917
You poor fools,

36:50.917 --> 36:54.917
your own creation destroyed you.

36:54.959 --> 36:56.750
(<i> electronic whooshing</i> )

36:56.792 --> 36:58.333
What was that noise?

36:58.375 --> 37:01.000
The unit has analyzed

36:58.375 --> 37:01.000
its last attack

37:01.041 --> 37:03.834
and constructed

37:01.041 --> 37:03.834
a new, stronger...

37:03.875 --> 37:05.291
deadlier weapon.

37:05.333 --> 37:07.583
In a moment,

37:05.333 --> 37:07.583
it will launch that weapon

37:07.625 --> 37:10.291
against the targets

37:07.625 --> 37:10.291
on the surface.

37:10.333 --> 37:11.667
Abort it!

37:11.709 --> 37:13.291
Why would I want to do that?

37:13.333 --> 37:15.917
It can't demonstrate

37:13.333 --> 37:15.917
its abilities

37:15.959 --> 37:19.083
unless we let it

37:15.959 --> 37:19.083
leave the nest.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.959
They are down there, sir.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.583
Let's clear

37:23.000 --> 37:24.583
some of that away.

37:24.625 --> 37:26.250
If Data's

37:24.625 --> 37:26.250
calculations

37:24.625 --> 37:26.250
are correct

37:26.291 --> 37:28.125
the next one

37:26.291 --> 37:28.125
should show itself

37:28.166 --> 37:30.166
in two minutes.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.417
Captain!

37:33.458 --> 37:34.709
Can you hear me?

37:34.750 --> 37:36.583
Yes, we're here!

37:36.625 --> 37:38.250
Are you all right?

37:39.792 --> 37:41.834
Dr. Crusher is seriously hurt.

37:41.875 --> 37:43.875
We can't contact

37:41.875 --> 37:43.875
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

37:43.917 --> 37:45.458
The communicators are out.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.500
Yes, our communicators

37:45.500 --> 37:47.500
are out, too.

37:47.542 --> 37:48.792
Those devices

37:48.834 --> 37:51.083
are part of a system

37:48.834 --> 37:51.083
located down here.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.583
Another one is about

37:51.125 --> 37:53.583
to be released.

37:51.125 --> 37:53.583
Watch yourself!

37:53.625 --> 37:55.125
We know, Captain.

37:55.166 --> 37:56.291
It's too far down there.

37:56.333 --> 37:57.542
There's nothing

37:56.333 --> 37:57.542
to hold on to.

37:57.583 --> 37:58.834
There's no way

37:57.583 --> 37:58.834
to climb down.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.458
I'm surprised either

37:58.875 --> 38:00.458
of them survived.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.500
I can do it,

38:00.500 --> 38:01.500
Commander.

38:01.542 --> 38:02.625
How?

38:02.667 --> 38:04.667
Jump.

38:04.709 --> 38:07.083
Data, it's over ten meters.

38:07.125 --> 38:09.000
11.75, sir.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.500
Data...

38:10.542 --> 38:12.959
you may be sturdy,

38:10.542 --> 38:12.959
but you're not indestructible.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.333
I believe I can safely

38:13.000 --> 38:16.333
traverse the distance.

38:16.375 --> 38:19.458
Captain, Data is going

38:19.500 --> 38:21.750
to join you down there.

38:23.709 --> 38:25.083
Be my guest.

38:30.458 --> 38:32.041
Data.

38:32.083 --> 38:34.083
At your service, Captain.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
We'd better find

38:43.500 --> 38:45.500
a defensive position.

38:45.542 --> 38:46.625
If Data's right...

38:46.667 --> 38:48.125
He usually is.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.458
We're going to have company

38:48.166 --> 38:50.458
any minute now

38:50.500 --> 38:53.542
and this time, I don't know

38:50.500 --> 38:53.542
how we're going to stop it.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.417
LA FORGE:

39:09.333 --> 39:11.083

39:11.125 --> 39:14.125
Shields and

39:11.125 --> 39:14.125
deflectors are up.

39:14.166 --> 39:16.750
Ensign T'su,

39:14.166 --> 39:16.750
when I order the shields down

39:16.792 --> 39:18.166
you have one responsibility:

39:18.208 --> 39:20.917
locate the away team,

39:18.208 --> 39:20.917
and get them up here.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.792
You may only have a few seconds.

39:22.834 --> 39:24.750
Approaching

39:22.834 --> 39:24.750
the planet, sir.

39:24.792 --> 39:27.250
Ride's going to get

39:24.792 --> 39:27.250
a little bumpy.

39:27.291 --> 39:28.667
Things are going to happen fast.

39:28.709 --> 39:32.875
Just keep alert,

39:28.709 --> 39:32.875
stay calm.

39:32.917 --> 39:34.625
Let's focus on what we're doing.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.959
You know your jobs.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.375
You've been trained,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.375
you've been tested...

39:39.417 --> 39:42.166
and you've earned the right

39:39.417 --> 39:42.166
to sit in those chairs.

39:44.667 --> 39:46.709
(<i> rhythmic beeping</i> )

39:49.709 --> 39:50.875
(<i> electronic whooshing</i> )

39:50.917 --> 39:52.792
That sound again.

39:52.834 --> 39:54.417
Another weapon has

39:52.834 --> 39:54.417
been launched, sir.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.375
We've got to find some way

39:54.458 --> 39:56.375
to stop the system.

39:56.417 --> 39:58.417
I would need to see

39:56.417 --> 39:58.417
the program's schematic.

39:58.458 --> 39:59.583
You've got it.

39:59.625 --> 40:01.083
(<i> beeping whine</i> )

40:01.125 --> 40:03.125
Is it possible

40:01.125 --> 40:03.125
to readjust

40:03.166 --> 40:05.166
the targeting

40:03.166 --> 40:05.166
sequence?

40:05.208 --> 40:06.375
Absolutely.

40:06.417 --> 40:08.166
It wouldn't be much good

40:06.417 --> 40:08.166
without it.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.500
Data, assign it

40:08.208 --> 40:09.500
a neutral target.

40:09.542 --> 40:10.917
Target must be

40:09.542 --> 40:10.917
specific, sir.

40:10.959 --> 40:12.667
Itself, then. Itself

40:10.959 --> 40:12.667
or its own power source.

40:12.709 --> 40:13.792
The force of

40:12.709 --> 40:13.792
that explosion

40:13.834 --> 40:14.959
would destroy

40:13.834 --> 40:14.959
this cavern

40:15.000 --> 40:16.208
and everyone

40:15.000 --> 40:16.208
on the surface.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.542
Watch now.

40:17.583 --> 40:21.583
This is the fourth

40:17.583 --> 40:21.583
and final projectile.

40:21.625 --> 40:24.458
The Echo Papa Series 607

40:24.500 --> 40:28.083
is about to complete

40:24.500 --> 40:28.083
this phase of its mission.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.083
We could split up.

40:29.125 --> 40:30.125
What good would that do?

40:30.166 --> 40:31.542
Confuse it, delay it,

40:30.166 --> 40:31.542
something.

40:31.583 --> 40:32.792
It would still get us.

40:32.834 --> 40:34.291
It would just take

40:32.834 --> 40:34.291
a little longer.

40:34.333 --> 40:36.125
It might give one of us time

40:34.333 --> 40:36.125
to get out of range.

40:36.166 --> 40:37.083
Out of range?

40:37.125 --> 40:38.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

40:38.208 --> 40:39.667
Forget I said it.

40:39.709 --> 40:41.250
These devices wiped out

40:39.709 --> 40:41.250
an entire planet.

40:41.291 --> 40:42.417
I don't think

40:41.291 --> 40:42.417
it has a range.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.875
Then what does

40:42.458 --> 40:43.875
that leave us?

40:43.917 --> 40:46.083
(<i> sighs</i> )

40:46.125 --> 40:48.041
Right. That's

40:46.125 --> 40:48.041
what I thought.

40:48.083 --> 40:50.125
On the other hand,

40:48.083 --> 40:50.125
we could look

40:50.166 --> 40:51.250
for different cover!

40:56.291 --> 40:59.333
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

40:59.375 --> 41:01.291
You got any ideas?

41:01.333 --> 41:02.959
None.

41:05.417 --> 41:08.250
Give me some options,

41:05.417 --> 41:08.250
Data, quickly.

41:08.291 --> 41:10.166
Why don't you just shut it off?

41:10.208 --> 41:12.208
Is that possible?

41:12.250 --> 41:13.458
Why not?

41:13.500 --> 41:15.542
It's a machine, isn't it?

41:15.583 --> 41:17.125
Shut it off.

41:17.166 --> 41:21.208
Why? You haven't seen half

41:17.166 --> 41:21.208
of what this beauty can do.

41:21.250 --> 41:22.625
We've seen enough.

41:24.291 --> 41:26.000
Does that mean

41:24.291 --> 41:26.000
you're going to buy it?

41:26.041 --> 41:27.875
Yes, yes!

41:26.041 --> 41:27.875
We've seen enough!

41:26.041 --> 41:27.875
You made a sale!

41:27.917 --> 41:29.625
You won't be sorry.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.667
Good! Now end

41:29.667 --> 41:31.667
the demonstration!

41:31.709 --> 41:33.000
Done.

41:40.250 --> 41:41.500
PICARD:

41:40.250 --> 41:41.500
Number One?

41:41.542 --> 41:42.792
Right here.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.500
(<i> sighs</i> )

41:44.542 --> 41:46.208
That was close.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.083
La Forge,

41:46.250 --> 41:48.083
everything's all right.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.375
We've neutralized it.

41:49.417 --> 41:50.750
(<i> crash</i> )

41:50.792 --> 41:52.125
It's great to hear

41:50.792 --> 41:52.125
your voice, Captain

41:52.166 --> 41:53.500
but we're a little busy

41:52.166 --> 41:53.500
right now.

41:53.542 --> 41:54.625
I'll get right back to you.

41:54.667 --> 41:55.875
Phasers at full

41:54.667 --> 41:55.875
readiness.

41:55.917 --> 41:57.333
Keep those shields

41:55.917 --> 41:57.333
at full power.

41:57.375 --> 41:58.959
Ahead one-quarter.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.333
Heading 25

41:59.000 --> 42:01.333
mark 300.

42:01.375 --> 42:02.583
Sir, that heading

42:01.375 --> 42:02.583
will take us further

42:02.625 --> 42:04.291
into the planet's atmosphere.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.083
That's correct. We're going

42:04.333 --> 42:06.083
to lose some maneuverability

42:06.125 --> 42:07.333
so keep a firm hand

42:06.125 --> 42:07.333
on the helm.

42:07.375 --> 42:09.041
Aye, sir.

42:09.083 --> 42:11.500
You hope our attacker will

42:09.083 --> 42:11.500
follow us into the atmosphere.

42:11.542 --> 42:12.917
I'm counting on it.

42:12.959 --> 42:14.792
Lian, scan for any

42:12.959 --> 42:14.792
air disruption or vortex.

42:14.834 --> 42:16.250
Cloak or no cloak

42:16.291 --> 42:17.792
we'll spot it by its turbulence.

42:17.834 --> 42:19.792
Worf, how fast

42:17.834 --> 42:19.792
can you get a

42:17.834 --> 42:19.792
phaser lock?

42:19.834 --> 42:21.166
Fast.

42:21.208 --> 42:22.667
Hull temperature 1,000 degrees

42:21.208 --> 42:22.667
and rising.

42:22.709 --> 42:24.000
Emergency power to deflectors.

42:24.041 --> 42:24.959
Velocity increasing.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.792
Steady as she goes.

42:33.041 --> 42:35.166
Hull temperature

42:33.041 --> 42:35.166
2,500 degrees.

42:35.208 --> 42:37.166
Deflectors nearing overload.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.250
(<i> fast beeping</i> )

42:38.291 --> 42:40.250
Sir, helm's going unresponsive.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.083
Can you compensate?

42:40.291 --> 42:42.083
Yes, sir, I can.

42:42.125 --> 42:43.959
Hull 3,000 degrees.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.166
Maintain heading.

42:45.208 --> 42:46.709
WORF:

42:45.208 --> 42:46.709
We're about to lose

42:46.750 --> 42:48.333
number four deflector.

42:48.375 --> 42:50.291
3,300 degrees.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.375
Deflector four

42:50.333 --> 42:52.375
is now inoperative.

42:52.417 --> 42:53.583
Turbulence to starboard!

42:58.375 --> 42:59.917
There he is!

42:59.959 --> 43:00.959
Scanners locked.

43:01.000 --> 43:01.917
Weapons locked.

43:01.959 --> 43:03.083
Fire!

43:08.417 --> 43:09.542
Got him!

43:09.583 --> 43:12.417
(<i> sighs</i> )

43:12.458 --> 43:15.125
Shields down.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.458
(<i> beeping</i> )

43:16.500 --> 43:18.125
Locked onto away team.

43:18.166 --> 43:20.166
Beaming them home now.

43:20.208 --> 43:22.083
Come to 40, mark 65.

43:22.125 --> 43:26.750
Ahead one-third,

43:22.125 --> 43:26.750
and assume a standard orbit.

43:26.792 --> 43:27.959
Standard orbit.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.500
Aye, sir.

43:29.542 --> 43:31.667
(<i> sighs</i> )

43:40.375 --> 43:41.792
Relinquishing command,

43:40.375 --> 43:41.792
Captain.

43:41.834 --> 43:43.250
As you were, Lieutenant.

43:43.291 --> 43:45.125
Sir?

43:45.166 --> 43:47.375
Mr. La Forge, when I left

43:45.166 --> 43:47.375
this ship, it was in one piece.

43:47.417 --> 43:49.250
I would appreciate

43:47.417 --> 43:49.250
your returning it to me

43:49.291 --> 43:51.166
in the same condition.

43:51.208 --> 43:52.375
You concur, Number One?

43:52.417 --> 43:53.917
Absolutely, sir.

43:56.709 --> 43:58.333
Lieutenant Solis

43:58.375 --> 44:01.250
plot a course to rendezvous

43:58.375 --> 44:01.250
with the Saucer Section.

44:01.291 --> 44:02.375
Sick Bay reports

44:02.417 --> 44:03.875
Dr. Crusher's

44:02.417 --> 44:03.875
going to be fine.

44:03.917 --> 44:07.458
Course plotted

44:03.917 --> 44:07.458
and laid in.

44:11.291 --> 44:13.542
Engage.
