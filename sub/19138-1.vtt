00:54.313 --> 00:56.115
Ah! You're here.

00:56.149 --> 00:59.189
Hello. Welcome.
I'm Dr. Clayton Forrester,

00:59.190 --> 01:01.989
and soon you will all bow down before me.

01:02.756 --> 01:05.859
What you're about to see is
an experiment,

01:05.994 --> 01:10.698
and, by observing,
you have become part of that experiment.

01:10.900 --> 01:15.438
For I have shot a man into space
and I'm driving him crazy

01:15.472 --> 01:18.975
by forcing him to watch
the worst movies ever made.

01:20.778 --> 01:24.282
Oh, sure, we all have thought about it,
but I had the guts to do it!

01:27.419 --> 01:29.778
This is my test subject:
Mike Nelson.

01:29.789 --> 01:32.383
A disgustingly
mild-mannered dope

01:32.384 --> 01:36.430
who has managed to survive
every film I subjected him to.

01:37.133 --> 01:42.606
But perhaps this movie will drive him
to the breaking point and crush his soul,

01:42.905 --> 01:45.724
and then I'll unleash it
on an unwitting public,

01:45.993 --> 01:48.522
and then I will rule the world!
Yes!

01:51.350 --> 01:52.785
I'm a naughty boy!

01:52.814 --> 01:55.421
Naughty, naughty, naughty,
naugh... ty.

01:56.123 --> 01:59.082
Well,
you will join Mike

01:59.118 --> 02:02.597
in watching the Universal classic

02:02.697 --> 02:04.599
<i>This Island Earth</i>

02:04.933 --> 02:09.437
Now, prepare yourselves
for my maddest madness yet!

02:11.107 --> 02:13.376
Now poopie.

02:26.035 --> 02:27.926
<i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i>

02:28.001 --> 02:30.251
<i>The Movie</i>

03:58.473 --> 03:59.674
Morning, Mike!

04:00.042 --> 04:02.044
Morning, Gypsy!
Whaddaya got for me?

04:02.144 --> 04:04.947
Oxygen-nitrogen mix is within
required standards,

04:05.250 --> 04:08.587
we're currently in low orbit
over Southern Madagascar,

04:08.622 --> 04:11.924
and that wonderful smell
is a lamb roast I have in the oven.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.660
- And sweet yams?
- Affirmative!

04:13.669 --> 04:16.295
Oh, and I compiled today's
wire service reports.

04:16.551 --> 04:17.718
Here's a hard copy.

04:17.918 --> 04:20.000
The Cubs lost again.

04:21.101 --> 04:22.770
Oh! Why, hello Mike!

04:22.817 --> 04:25.974
Everything workin' fine on the
ol' Satellite of Love today, hmm?

04:25.981 --> 04:29.445
No dangerous problems or
horrible mishaps in sight?

04:29.453 --> 04:32.049
No, Tom,
everything appears nominal.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.084
Ah, nominal,
good, good.

04:34.093 --> 04:36.165
So I guess that means
you're not worried about

04:36.166 --> 04:38.356
what that rythmic pounding might be.

04:38.366 --> 04:41.493
- Yeah, what is that?
- Yeah, what is that, hmm?

04:41.594 --> 04:44.333
I'm a highly sophisticated robot,
Mike, and I'm telling you:

04:44.368 --> 04:46.198
This is not something
you should be hearing!

04:46.366 --> 04:48.021
Something's causing this, Mike!

04:48.309 --> 04:49.671
Hm, now let's think.

04:49.672 --> 04:51.805
I'm here, you're here,
Gypsy's here...

04:51.816 --> 04:54.909
- Ok, Tom, where's Crow?
- Where's Crow?

04:54.922 --> 04:56.188
Uh, I'm not supposed to say anything,

04:56.189 --> 05:00.284
but I did see that litle moron headed towards
the basement with a pickaxe in his hand.

05:00.294 --> 05:01.518
Gypsy!
Go to condition yellow!

05:01.619 --> 05:03.189
- We gotta stop him!
- Roger!

05:04.196 --> 05:08.096
It's a loooong way
to Tipperary,

05:09.112 --> 05:12.968
to the sweetest girl I know!

05:14.007 --> 05:20.872
Goodbye to Noah Berry!
Hello Harold Lloooooyd!

05:22.745 --> 05:23.861
- Crow?
- Huh?

05:24.114 --> 05:26.349
Crow, listen,
you've gotta stop!

05:26.359 --> 05:28.765
Oh! Hi Mike!
I've found the perfect spot!

05:29.394 --> 05:33.057
Once I break through this wall,
we'll tunnel our way right back to Earth!

05:33.724 --> 05:35.944
Crow, you big dope!
You can't tunnel through space!

05:36.046 --> 05:39.229
Come, come, boys, we must
confound Jerry at every turn!

05:39.466 --> 05:41.601
Crow, no!
You'll breach the hull!

05:41.801 --> 05:43.208
HULL
BREACH

05:48.277 --> 05:49.879
I didn't expect this!

05:50.280 --> 05:53.330
Gaining maximum R.P.M.

05:53.331 --> 05:55.720
Adjust pitch and yaw thrusters!
Stabilize!

05:55.887 --> 05:57.589
There! That should do it.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.367
Wow, this <i>is</i> confusing!

06:05.578 --> 06:08.100
Mike!
You wanna hand me me my calculations?

06:08.102 --> 06:09.862
Thank you.
Well, look at that.

06:09.877 --> 06:11.271
"Breach hull; all die."

06:11.463 --> 06:12.574
Even had it underlined.

06:15.149 --> 06:16.266
I don't wanna die!

06:17.391 --> 06:19.730
Oh! Mommy! Mommy!

06:20.784 --> 06:22.721
I love you, Mike!

06:30.162 --> 06:33.431
- Atta boy, Servo!
- I won't do <i>that</i> again!

06:34.512 --> 06:37.572
Hey! I'm experiencing a sensation
altogether new to me!

06:37.582 --> 06:38.640
And frankly,<i> I love it!</i>

06:38.940 --> 06:41.743
Now, Crow, I told you:
No more escape attempts.

06:41.753 --> 06:44.611
Believe me, Mike,
I calculated the odds of this succeeding

06:44.778 --> 06:46.727
versus against the odds
I was doing something incredibly stupid

06:47.040 --> 06:48.752
and I went ahead anyway.

06:49.016 --> 06:50.629
There you go.

06:51.389 --> 06:52.824
Aw, darn!

06:55.027 --> 06:58.130
It's time!
Dr. F. is calling for you.

07:01.734 --> 07:03.937
Ah, Mike.
<i>Robots.</i>

07:04.171 --> 07:05.812
I'm feeling particularly evil

07:05.823 --> 07:07.221
because today's experiment

07:07.533 --> 07:09.474
is a stinky cinematic
suppository called

07:10.145 --> 07:11.813
<i>This Island Earth</i>

07:12.214 --> 07:16.017
You may just all bow down before me
after this stinkburger.

07:16.252 --> 07:18.378
Say, come to think about it,

07:18.379 --> 07:21.157
I don't believe you've
bowed down before me recently.

07:21.792 --> 07:23.675
Uh, sure we have,
last week.

07:24.033 --> 07:27.017
No, no, no! I think that was
more of a curtsey than a bow.

07:27.055 --> 07:30.504
So why don't we all
just bow down... now.

07:30.769 --> 07:31.802
I don't see a reason
to make us...

07:38.547 --> 07:39.706
Bowing, sir!

07:39.906 --> 07:41.718
...I bow before you, sir...

07:44.355 --> 07:46.190
Okay, Dr. Forrester.
Jees!

07:46.357 --> 07:47.625
What a dickweed!

07:47.635 --> 07:49.184
Well, now that
we've had our little fun,

07:49.185 --> 07:51.428
prepare yourself for...
uh...

07:51.439 --> 07:53.429
But, before I start
the experiment... uh...

07:54.244 --> 07:56.035
Did you,
you know, go?

07:56.202 --> 07:57.370
Yes.

07:57.603 --> 08:00.373
Because I don't wanna
have to stop the movie for...

08:00.440 --> 08:01.975
- You know.
- You won't.

08:02.242 --> 08:04.227
Then, prepare yourselves for...

08:04.228 --> 08:06.213
<i>This Island Earth</i>

08:08.049 --> 08:11.119
We've got Movie Sign!

08:32.914 --> 08:35.383
<i>Ah, it's the nicest weather
Earth has ever had!</i>

08:35.918 --> 08:37.741
<i>Notice how big Japan is?</i>

08:42.491 --> 08:44.428
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

08:44.439 --> 08:47.465
<i>These are the voyages of</i>
Babylon 5.

08:48.466 --> 08:51.569
<i>Doesn't the fact that it's universal
make it international?</i>

08:55.575 --> 08:59.379
<i>This island earth can be yours
if the price is right!</i>

09:01.349 --> 09:03.217
<i>Hey, who sneezed on the credits?</i>

09:05.890 --> 09:08.125
<i>Okay, let's see here.
Shatner? Shatner?</i>

09:08.325 --> 09:10.661
<i>Nope! Doesn't look like
he's in this one, we're safe!</i>

09:12.998 --> 09:14.733
<i>I feel so insignificant.</i>

09:15.134 --> 09:17.537
<i>Of course,
</i> I always <i> feel insignificant!</i>

09:20.507 --> 09:25.245
<i>The light from this credits originated
well over 7.000 years ago.</i>

09:30.186 --> 09:31.987
<i>Boy, the universe
is really cruising.</i>

09:32.788 --> 09:35.118
<i>Look, there's Taurus,
the bull!</i>

09:35.119 --> 09:37.693
<i>And right underneath him
the constellation Feces.</i>

09:37.704 --> 09:40.497
<i>Oh, look!
Orion is bankrupt.</i>

09:42.133 --> 09:44.235
<i>So, these are images
from the Hubble?</i>

09:46.572 --> 09:50.953
<i>When in California,
be sure to visit beautiful... oh...</i>

09:54.250 --> 09:58.421
<i>It's a long par 5 leading
to the nation's capital.</i>

09:58.456 --> 10:00.990
<i>Who'd build so far back
on the lot?</i>

10:01.592 --> 10:04.761
<i>Washingtonland,
the new Disney theme park!</i>

10:06.898 --> 10:10.235
One more. Just one more,
please, Dr. Meacham.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.291
Hold it, please.
A little closer to the wing, sir.

10:12.302 --> 10:13.292
<i>Watch your lips!</i>

10:13.305 --> 10:14.805
A little more profile,
Dr. Meacham.

10:14.840 --> 10:17.343
He wants to get that
faraway, visionary look.

10:18.111 --> 10:20.013
Cal, we know how
tired you must be.

10:20.014 --> 10:22.073
- We'll make it as short as possible.
- Fire away, gentlemen,

10:22.284 --> 10:25.219
I warn you, I am beginning
to feel faraway and visionary.

10:25.254 --> 10:27.689
How about your conference with
the committee on atomic power?

10:27.697 --> 10:30.425
Not my conference. Twenty engineers
and scientists were there.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.362
Twenty? Hardly a routine meeting,
would you say?

10:32.695 --> 10:34.611
Yeah, and look, Cal:
we won't buy the committee's

10:34.612 --> 10:37.067
getting you VIPs together
for a cocktail party.

10:37.601 --> 10:39.136
All right, boys,
I'll tell you this much.

10:39.571 --> 10:41.854
You boys like to call this
"the push-button age."

10:42.147 --> 10:43.506
It isn't. Not yet.

10:43.706 --> 10:46.111
Not until we can team up
atomic energy with electronics.

10:46.147 --> 10:48.416
Then we'll have the horses
as well as the cart.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.678
How long has the army
been handing out jets, doctor?

10:50.700 --> 10:51.555
<i>Yeah!</i>

10:51.556 --> 10:53.389
One of the boys at Lockheed
handed me this one.

10:53.822 --> 10:55.724
I hope you taxpayers don't mind.

10:55.735 --> 10:56.906
<i>We do!</i>

10:57.106 --> 10:58.895
Cal, when do we get
to this "push-button age"?

10:58.905 --> 11:01.635
When fellows like me stop talking
about it and get back to our labs.

11:01.805 --> 11:02.513
See you gentlemen later.

11:02.514 --> 11:03.414
- Goodbye!
- So long!

11:03.601 --> 11:04.769
<i>Kiss me goodbye?</i>

11:04.836 --> 11:07.162
Cal, are you working on anything
along the lines you mentioned?

11:07.659 --> 11:09.257
- Roughly.
- Well, remember me, will you?

11:09.676 --> 11:10.910
<i>I'm the wormy guy.</i>

11:10.920 --> 11:12.835
I'm concentrating on the
reconversion of certain

11:12.836 --> 11:14.914
common elements into nuclear
energy sources.

11:15.278 --> 11:18.852
- Huh? How's that again?
- What counts is how I make it work.

11:18.995 --> 11:20.588
I see.
Good flight, Cal.

11:20.924 --> 11:21.686
- Thank you.
- So long.

11:21.697 --> 11:23.222
<i>- Dickweed.
- Jack-off.</i>

11:25.494 --> 11:27.730
<i>Other people need to
use this ladder, you know?</i>

11:30.200 --> 11:33.570
<i>My wife has the seat so close,
how can she drive like this?</i>

11:36.042 --> 11:39.045
<i>Those decals are really hard
to put on without ripping.</i>

11:43.718 --> 11:47.054
<i>John Sununu goes
for a haircut.</i>

11:48.457 --> 11:52.294
<i>Fortunately, he has
his theme music on eight-track.</i>

11:53.429 --> 11:55.531
<i>Hey! You can see
the Cubs losing!</i>

12:01.840 --> 12:05.310
<i>Geez, there's soccer teams
lying all over the place!</i>

12:08.347 --> 12:11.083
<i>Oh, for crying out...
when are they gonna fill that in?</i>

12:12.553 --> 12:14.087
<i>Hey, his legs are sticking out!</i>

12:17.088 --> 12:20.088
<i>Ricola!</i>

12:21.597 --> 12:24.333
<i>I'm so lost!</i>

12:26.271 --> 12:29.975
<i>Keanu Reeves in</i>
My Own Private Airfield.

12:30.610 --> 12:33.250
<i>Hello, can I see your pass,
sir... ah... whatever.</i>

12:39.220 --> 12:42.324
<i>Putting the men's room in the tower,
what was I thinking?</i>

12:42.490 --> 12:45.594
2XD341, calling
Ryberg Control tower. Come in.

12:46.128 --> 12:49.899
2XD341, this is Ryberg
Control tower. Go ahead.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.134
O.K. to come in, Webb?

12:51.168 --> 12:52.135
<i>Are you decent?</i>

12:52.369 --> 12:56.139
All clear, Cal. Drift south
about 20 miles per hour.

12:56.180 --> 12:57.881
Hi, Webb.
what's Cal's ETA?

12:58.044 --> 13:00.378
- 1410, but he's late—
- Half an hour late.

13:00.389 --> 13:02.432
That's my boss.
The only guy in the world

13:02.433 --> 13:04.183
who can travel by jet and still be late.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.119
<i>Duh, I made a funny,
heh heh.</i>

13:06.653 --> 13:09.256
- Where are you?
- Look out the window.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.928
<i>Look out,
President Clinton!</i>

13:17.501 --> 13:19.670
<i>Maverick!</i>

13:24.109 --> 13:26.044
<i>Could I love him more?</i>

13:29.081 --> 13:31.284
<i>Ah damn, I spilled my
Big Gulp.</i>

13:34.656 --> 13:37.025
<i>Should we be seeing this?</i>

13:39.862 --> 13:41.563
<i>Nothing! Nothing!</i>

13:41.797 --> 13:42.765
Cal, what's wrong?

13:43.098 --> 13:44.166
I have no control.

13:44.177 --> 13:45.869
<i>I keep eating and eating!</i>

13:48.438 --> 13:49.926
Cut loose, Cal! Bail out!

13:49.961 --> 13:51.749
I can't. I'm too low.

13:52.003 --> 13:53.999
<i>I've got the blues so bad,
uh huh.</i>

13:58.116 --> 14:00.076
Jerking around must have caused a flameout.

14:00.111 --> 14:00.619
No power.

14:00.630 --> 14:01.588
No nothing!

14:01.608 --> 14:03.389
<i>No Tickee!
No Shirtee!</i>

14:04.393 --> 14:05.561
<i>Green Acres!</i>

14:09.967 --> 14:13.070
<i>Well, suddenly I have
a refreshing mint flavor.</i>

14:14.572 --> 14:17.742
<i>Early LSD tests in the
Air Force.</i>

14:20.679 --> 14:23.549
<i>This is a job for
Weenie-man!</i>

14:25.518 --> 14:27.821
<i>Eat at Joe's. Eat at Joe's.
Eat at Joe's.</i>

14:30.157 --> 14:31.345
<i>Wow, they're ringing!</i>

14:31.491 --> 14:34.128
<i>Now he knows what the world sounds
like to Pete Townshend.</i>

14:35.764 --> 14:37.266
<i>Into the Weenie-mobile.</i>

14:37.566 --> 14:40.669
<i>Weenie-man away!</i>

14:43.873 --> 14:47.644
<i>I'd like to thank me
for flying me Airways.</i>

14:52.984 --> 14:55.553
<i>- Uh, there's a green switch.
It was there all the time! - D'oh!</i>

14:55.890 --> 14:58.927
<i>G.I. Joe action-set.
Nerdy Joe not included.</i>

15:01.130 --> 15:03.032
- Cal, you okay?
- Okay.

15:03.042 --> 15:04.800
What happened?
How'd you bring it in?

15:05.258 --> 15:06.844
- I didn't. Couldn't.
<i>- I died.</i>

15:06.925 --> 15:08.857
- What do you mean you didn't?
- Controls went out.

15:09.234 --> 15:11.645
- Huh?
- That's right. No controls, no power.

15:11.855 --> 15:13.000
The plane died up there.

15:13.109 --> 15:15.000
- I should be dead.
<i>- Did you bring me a toy?</i>

15:15.647 --> 15:17.862
Cal, I know everybody's
seeing flying saucers

15:18.062 --> 15:19.685
and screwy
lights up in the sky.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.125
Well, you can put me
in the booby hatch too,

15:22.126 --> 15:24.757
because, so help me, I saw this ship
turn a bright green up there.

15:24.768 --> 15:26.560
- Are you sure, Joe?
- Positive.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.162
- Did you hear anything?
- Yes.

15:28.696 --> 15:32.466
A high-frequency howl, very high,
all the time your ship was—

15:32.477 --> 15:34.102
- Green?
<i>- Green?</i>

15:34.110 --> 15:36.938
- Did Webb see it?
- Unless he's blind.

15:36.949 --> 15:38.774
- Check him.
- Right.

15:38.784 --> 15:40.322
Oh, and, Joe,
until we find out what happened,

15:40.515 --> 15:41.844
all three of us were blind.

15:41.855 --> 15:44.681
<i>I'll go pop Webb's eyes out.</i>

15:46.686 --> 15:48.455
<i>¿So, was being green fun?</i>

15:48.465 --> 15:50.724
<i>- Okay, I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
- I was just wondering, I mean...</i>

15:50.735 --> 15:53.060
<i>- I've always wanted to...
- No. Shut up.</i>

15:55.297 --> 15:58.533
- How's the little giant? - Growing up.
Getting ready to astound the world.

15:58.567 --> 16:00.002
Let's take a look.

16:00.069 --> 16:01.611
I figured that.
She's all ready and waiting.

16:01.668 --> 16:03.539
<i>Wow, that's one hell of a
View-Master.</i>

16:05.943 --> 16:09.413
<i>Oh yeah, this is when science
didn't have to have any specific purpose.</i>

16:11.049 --> 16:12.484
Lowering the cylinder.

16:12.784 --> 16:14.753
<i>Inserting the
breakfast pastry.</i>

16:17.390 --> 16:20.326
<i>The secret government Eggo project.</i>

16:21.561 --> 16:23.563
<i>Contact Dr. Jemima.</i>

16:24.599 --> 16:26.701
<i>I love the blueberrie ones best.</i>

16:31.740 --> 16:34.552
- Increase the rate of reaction.
<i>- Start warming the syrup.</i>

16:36.954 --> 16:37.979
<i>Yum.</i>

16:39.084 --> 16:40.652
Check rate of
radioactive decay.

16:40.663 --> 16:43.790
<i>Increase the Flash Gordon noise
and put more science stuff around.</i>

16:44.725 --> 16:48.062
Positive. Same it was
the whole week you were away.

16:49.230 --> 16:52.092
- What did the committee say?
- Oh, they were a little excited.

16:52.292 --> 16:53.329
A little!

16:53.935 --> 16:57.372
<i>Oh my god, my waffle!
Oh, the humanity!</i>

17:00.510 --> 17:01.778
<i>Fries are up!</i>

17:04.080 --> 17:05.382
<i>Oh no,
you're flooding it!</i>

17:06.250 --> 17:07.285
Zero reading.

17:08.019 --> 17:11.289
- The X-C condenser must have shorted
out again. - Get the spare.

17:11.457 --> 17:13.700
- Burned out yesterday!
<i>- Oh, we can't have nice things!</i>

17:13.981 --> 17:15.951
<i>Our liquorice ice cream cones melted!</i>

17:16.128 --> 17:19.398
And don't ask me why I didn't
order some new ones. I did.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.378
X-C condensers in an envelope?

17:22.380 --> 17:24.338
Must be a gag dreamed up
by the receiving department.

17:24.351 --> 17:28.244
I ordered two X-C condensers,
and supreme equipment sent me these beads.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.080
<i>He touched me!</i>

17:30.348 --> 17:32.500
You say they're a gag,
but they're condensers.

17:32.663 --> 17:35.253
I checked one for capacity
and voltage on the meter.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.323
- And blew it to bits.
- Yeah,

17:37.456 --> 17:40.092
After it held to 33.000 volts
and no leakage.

17:40.103 --> 17:41.762
<i>Where's my gun?</i>

17:44.966 --> 17:48.459
If that were true,
we could build a generator,

17:48.460 --> 17:51.340
One that would supply electric power
to run an entire factory.

17:52.174 --> 17:55.644
<i>Sort this, deliver that.
I'll make 'em all pay!</i>

17:56.680 --> 17:59.182
<i>Ah, the script has
finally arrived!</i>

18:00.117 --> 18:02.520
- Morning. - Morning.
- Sign here.

18:03.154 --> 18:05.923
<i>Wilt Chamberlain.</i>

18:06.992 --> 18:10.195
<i>- I don't like you.</i>
- Thank you.

18:12.398 --> 18:15.669
<i>Oh, my Niels Bohr swimsuit
calendar has arrived!</i>

18:15.802 --> 18:19.062
- What have you got?
- I don't know! There's no return address.

18:19.246 --> 18:21.677
<i>Oh, I hope
it's my lederhosen.</i>

18:22.713 --> 18:26.283
<i>How do they get blow up
one day in here.</i>

18:27.318 --> 18:30.521
"Electronics service,
Unit no. 16."

18:30.532 --> 18:31.924
<i>Give to daddy.</i>

18:34.728 --> 18:36.930
<i>Well, I'll read this
on the crapper.</i>

18:37.897 --> 18:41.534
"A catherimine tube with
an endiom complex of +4."

18:41.545 --> 18:45.306
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know, but this outfit has them.

18:46.108 --> 18:48.910
This isn't paper.
It's some kind of metal.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.179
<i>No sir, that's paper.</i>

18:51.447 --> 18:54.751
"Interocitor incorporating
planetary generator."

18:54.918 --> 18:57.888
"Interocitor with volterator...
with astroscope."

18:57.898 --> 18:59.623
<i>Hey, Ms. Interocitor.</i>

18:59.690 --> 19:01.798
- Here's something my wife could
use in the house: <i>- ¿A man?</i>

19:01.833 --> 19:04.963
"An interocitor incorporating
an electron sorter."

19:04.976 --> 19:07.783
Although she'd probably gain 20 pounds
while it did all the work for her.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.539
<i>Cal, you bitch!</i>

19:09.739 --> 19:12.115
According to this, there's
no limit to what it can do.

19:12.960 --> 19:16.012
Laying a four-lane highway at a mile
a minute would be a cinch.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.715
Cal, maybe we've
been working too hard.

19:19.073 --> 19:20.649
"Complete line of
interocitor parts...

19:21.390 --> 19:23.992
incorporating greater advances than
hitherto known in the field of electronics."

19:25.090 --> 19:28.193
<i>- Look, there's Waldo!</i>
- What exactly is an interocitor?

19:28.203 --> 19:30.329
I don't know,
and I don't want to know.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.465
<i>- Just love me!</i>
- Well, I do.

19:32.498 --> 19:34.334
I want to know what it is
and what it does.

19:34.345 --> 19:36.103
<i>And if I can break it.</i>

19:36.113 --> 19:39.506
- Order the list of parts on these pages.
- How we gonna build it?

19:39.517 --> 19:41.910
These symbols— they're like
a foreign language.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.645
<i>And I'm hungry!</i>

19:43.655 --> 19:45.208
Anyway, we don't know the address.

19:45.408 --> 19:47.733
You ordered the condensers
from supreme by teletype.

19:47.833 --> 19:48.900
Yeah.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.921
Which means that somebody intercepted
that order and sent us those beads.

19:51.932 --> 19:53.790
Here, try it again.

19:53.824 --> 19:55.025
You're too darn smart.

19:55.038 --> 19:56.329
<i>And handsome!</i>

19:56.339 --> 19:59.032
I may be the dumbest man who
ever walked this Earth, Joe.

19:59.042 --> 20:00.867
<i>No argument here.</i>

20:02.069 --> 20:05.840
<i>Ah, been ordering from the
Adam and Eve collection again, hmm.</i>

20:06.475 --> 20:09.678
<i>Joe, I'm one of these boxes.
Find me!</i>

20:11.647 --> 20:14.797
Here's the invoice.
No charge and no address.

20:14.886 --> 20:18.202
Listen to this: "No interocitor part
can be replaced.

20:18.381 --> 20:20.324
Bear this in mind
while assembling."

20:20.492 --> 20:23.428
<i>Use only genuine interocitor parts.</i>

20:24.296 --> 20:26.065
Well, let's
start unpacking.

20:26.075 --> 20:28.300
<i>Cal, are you gonna work
naked again?</i>

20:32.973 --> 20:35.842
<i>There, it's done.
What do you think?</i>

20:39.047 --> 20:41.282
<i>But before unpacking...
D'oh!</i>

20:41.950 --> 20:45.421
There's 2,486 parts.

20:45.434 --> 20:46.806
<i>2845, sir.</i>

20:46.943 --> 20:51.730
Each part is cross-indexed
into a symbol pattern.

20:52.665 --> 20:53.782
Shouldn't be too hard at all.

20:54.074 --> 20:58.605
Sure. A snap, maestro.
Only, uh, where do we start?

21:00.575 --> 21:01.876
Right here.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.279
<i>At goofy clown face.</i>

21:04.290 --> 21:08.484
<i>Industry, science and
technology!</i>

21:08.784 --> 21:11.366
<i>Big men putting
screwdrivers into things...</i>

21:11.597 --> 21:15.592
<i>turning them, and adjusting them!</i>

21:15.993 --> 21:19.364
<i>Build your own
atom storage box!</i>

21:19.865 --> 21:23.168
<i>Bringing you state-of-the-art
in soft serve technology!</i>

21:23.502 --> 21:26.038
<i>Pulls off caps of any size jug,
bottle, or jar!</i>

21:26.049 --> 21:28.341
<i>And it really,
really works.</i>

21:32.013 --> 21:33.547
You know what
my kids would say:

21:33.557 --> 21:36.187
<i>- You're not my real father!</i>
- "Dig this crazy, mixed-up plumbing."

21:36.854 --> 21:38.889
Plug it in, Joe.
We'll see what happens.

21:38.899 --> 21:42.393
<i>He doesn't even have kids.
Poor, deluded Joe.</i>

21:43.428 --> 21:47.098
<i>Oh, please, say we can get the Sci-Fi
channel. Please, oh please, oh please...</i>

21:47.101 --> 21:50.870
<i>Look at this. Uh.
Comes with a Garth Brooks CD.</i>

21:50.881 --> 21:54.641
- Now what do I do?
- Clear your screen, please.

21:54.652 --> 21:56.511
<i>Okaay, Dr. Goofy!</i>

21:56.550 --> 21:57.440
You... can hear me?

21:57.456 --> 21:58.946
- Of course.
<i>- Duh.</i>

21:59.147 --> 22:02.250
Use the intensifier disk,
the one in your hand.

22:02.484 --> 22:04.153
<i>Any time, Einstein!</i>

22:04.163 --> 22:06.622
Place it in position
on your right.

22:06.633 --> 22:08.925
<i>Now, throw it at
Joe really hard!</i>

22:09.427 --> 22:13.464
<i>This... tss... uh...
thing... goes on the what's-this here.</i>

22:13.964 --> 22:19.104
Now turn the control
18 degrees to the left.

22:19.114 --> 22:24.009
<i>17. One more. Wait, back.
Oh! Well, that works too.</i>

22:26.282 --> 22:30.820
<i>It's the amazing Technicolor
cheese wedge!</i>

22:31.477 --> 22:32.437
<i>Nanoo nanoo!</i>

22:32.589 --> 22:35.859
You have successfully accomplished
your task, Dr. Meacham.

22:36.027 --> 22:40.131
You've assembled an interocitor,
a feat of which few men are capable.

22:40.532 --> 22:42.901
- Who are you?
- I'm called Exeter.

22:42.911 --> 22:43.836
<i>Doug Exeter.</i>

22:43.846 --> 22:47.806
I'm a scientist, like yourself.
Shall we say a... a colleague.

22:47.815 --> 22:51.637
My colleagues don't materialize out of
strange machines. They're flesh and blood.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.404
And so am I, Dr. Meacham,
as I hope you'll soon find out.

22:54.551 --> 22:57.850
<i>- Grrr. Grrr.</i> - ...although I admit
at the moment, I do appear immaterial.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.480
But no matter.

22:59.689 --> 23:02.890
I represent a group which is seeking
scientists of exceptional ability.

23:03.026 --> 23:03.893
<i>Do you know any?</i>

23:03.903 --> 23:06.996
All prospects must pass an aptitude test,
which you've just done.

23:07.007 --> 23:10.912
<i>- Damn... where do I control... damn, jees.</i>
- ...only I don't remember applying for any job.

23:10.913 --> 23:13.850
You didn't—
I beg your pardon, Mr. Wilson.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.204
Your camera will pick up
nothing but black fog.

23:16.404 --> 23:17.845
<i>Oh, it's a Goldstar!</i>

23:17.945 --> 23:21.249
Images on the interocitor
don't register on film.

23:21.260 --> 23:22.418
- Put it away, Joe.
<i>- Go lie down.</i>

23:22.498 --> 23:23.606
To continue,
Dr. Meacham,

23:23.617 --> 23:27.726
We test out people without their knowledge.
We leave nothing to chance.

23:28.024 --> 23:30.994
Except the chance that I'm
not interested in you or your group.

23:31.005 --> 23:34.669
Come, come, doctor. It's not possible
that a man of your scientific curiosity...

23:34.681 --> 23:37.648
wouldn't want to find out
who I am, where I come from,

23:37.936 --> 23:39.171
<i>If I have pants on.</i>

23:39.237 --> 23:42.841
Wouldn't give his right arm for more
examples of our superior technical knowledge.

23:42.852 --> 23:45.400
I think I can assume, Dr. Meacham,
that you're sufficiently...

23:45.401 --> 23:47.948
intrigued to come to an immediate decision.

23:47.958 --> 23:51.919
We'd like you to join our... team,
as you might say, at once.

23:51.927 --> 23:53.749
You'll make arrangements
to leave immediately.

23:53.949 --> 23:55.555
Wait a moment.
I didn't say—

23:55.767 --> 23:58.445
At 5:00 Wednesday morning, our plane
will land at your field.

23:58.446 --> 24:01.164
It will wait exactly
five minutes and then depart.

24:01.174 --> 24:02.899
Whether I'm aboard or not?

24:03.161 --> 24:04.368
<i>Nanoo.</i>

24:04.400 --> 24:05.619
<i>Hi there.</i>

24:05.719 --> 24:08.341
Place the catalog on
that table with the blueprints.

24:08.351 --> 24:11.845
<i>Open it to the
underwear section. Yes!</i>

24:11.856 --> 24:15.349
<i>Alright, I'll do it,
you big-headed freak.</i>

24:15.360 --> 24:18.887
<i>Is this metal?
I got a bet with Joe.</i>

24:19.898 --> 24:22.158
Now stand aside, please.

24:22.692 --> 24:23.958
You too, Mr. Wilson.

24:23.993 --> 24:27.497
<i>No, farther towards the
Kill Zone, please.</i>

24:27.898 --> 24:30.334
<i>Yeah. God, I'm good.</i>

24:34.774 --> 24:37.810
<i>Dear God, I left
the iron plugged in!</i>

24:39.178 --> 24:42.348
<i>Come here, you big
dumb dope.</i>

24:42.716 --> 24:45.252
<i>Quick! Get the
baking soda!</i>

24:50.526 --> 24:54.963
<i>Well, Cal, there's nothing
left for you to break!</i>

24:55.634 --> 24:58.070
<i>Boy, the landlady's
gonna be mad!</i>

24:58.080 --> 24:59.976
<i>- Are you boys cooking up there?
- No!</i>

24:59.978 --> 25:01.874
<i>- Are you making an interocitor?
- No!</i>

25:01.884 --> 25:04.277
- You okay?
- Okay.

25:05.079 --> 25:07.581
- Within reason.
- If there is any reason around here.

25:07.591 --> 25:10.584
<i>What with all the shenanigans and
goings-on.</i>

25:13.955 --> 25:17.392
<i>Now that you have exploded,
any words for our listeners?</i>

25:17.403 --> 25:19.862
There's no reading now.

25:19.873 --> 25:21.865
- Cal.
- Yes, Joe?

25:21.875 --> 25:23.400
<i>I just like saying "Cal."</i>

25:23.410 --> 25:27.571
- Whoever that Exeter is, i don't like him.
- Don't you, Joe?

25:27.582 --> 25:30.141
<i>- That's 'cause you're a puss.
- What? What?</i>

25:30.145 --> 25:30.852
<i>Hey!</i>

25:30.853 --> 25:32.478
He was right about one thing.

25:32.488 --> 25:34.079
<i>I look good on a beret.</i>

25:34.089 --> 25:36.048
I'm gonna be on that plane.

25:38.284 --> 25:40.480
<i>Oh, hey wait,
what's that! Alright.</i>

25:40.481 --> 25:42.956
<i>- Let's get out of here!
- This will take a while.</i>

25:47.264 --> 25:49.900
Ah! Minor film break.
Happens all the time.

25:49.911 --> 25:52.003
I know exactly
what to do.

25:53.605 --> 25:57.265
My plan for breaking Mike's will, by making him
watch this horrible movie, continues as planned.

25:57.642 --> 26:01.448
I should be ruling the world by, uh,
6:00, 6:30 at the latest...

26:09.290 --> 26:11.503
That Cal fella, what a maroon!

26:11.919 --> 26:14.830
Who'd be stupid enough to give him
a laboratory or let him fly a jet?

26:15.165 --> 26:18.003
- I like Joe.
- Yeah, and if it were me flying that baby,

26:18.184 --> 26:20.062
and I had a low altitude
flameout like that,

26:20.327 --> 26:23.355
I'd just reduce my elevators, dip the nose
and fire up the engines.

26:23.495 --> 26:25.297
- You don't know how to fly!
- Sure I do!

26:25.410 --> 26:28.439
I'm fully instrument-rated for
Microsoft Flight Simulator.

26:28.469 --> 26:30.433
- Well then you fly the Satellite of Love?
- Yeah.

26:30.697 --> 26:31.417
What, this thing?

26:31.702 --> 26:33.206
No, I can't do that, see,
'cause...

26:33.676 --> 26:37.019
It's not the same, there's no air foil so
there's no ability to turn when you're up in the...

26:37.755 --> 26:40.916
All right, all right. Fine, you two.
Spread out, spread out.

26:42.737 --> 26:47.166
What do ya do with a drunken sailor,
early in the morning! Hay-ho and up she—

26:47.278 --> 26:49.711
Okay out baby, out.

26:50.135 --> 26:52.499
Well don't come crying to me
when you get us all killed!

26:52.769 --> 26:54.571
Yeah, right.
Let's see here.

26:55.408 --> 26:56.984
Hey, this is going to be
easier then I thought.

27:06.088 --> 27:08.413
- Help!
- Hey Mike, you hit something!

27:09.491 --> 27:11.392
It's the hubble!
You killed the hubble!

27:12.453 --> 27:15.056
- Gypsy, could you please get that—
- Uh huh. No way!

27:15.189 --> 27:18.200
This is you're dishwashing liquid!
You soak in it!

27:21.087 --> 27:23.367
Ah! Ah! The manipulator arm!
The manipulator arm!

27:44.258 --> 27:47.092
- Carefully... carefully... wait...
- That's it! That's it!

27:47.504 --> 27:50.286
- It's only 6 billion dollars. Remember.
- Hope you're insured, Mike!

27:51.544 --> 27:53.351
It's only the most expensive
satellite ever built.

27:53.788 --> 27:56.167
Near. Very fragile.
No, wait. Very fragile.

27:56.895 --> 27:57.735
Better leave a note
on the windshield, Mike.

27:59.399 --> 28:01.352
Back up, and slow again.
Wait. Don't.

28:02.627 --> 28:03.775
Don't do that!

28:05.496 --> 28:07.265
Sorry. It's...

28:10.022 --> 28:14.677
Now, I'm just gonna release it gently,
like a sparrow into the night sky.

28:17.121 --> 28:18.473
Good night, sweet Hubble.

28:18.484 --> 28:21.342
And a flight of angels
sing thou to thy rest.

28:34.005 --> 28:35.390
Oh, good one, Mike.

28:35.572 --> 28:37.753
But, how could it do that?
It couldn't possibly...

28:38.007 --> 28:39.785
Oh, great, and now
we have Movie Sign.

28:39.958 --> 28:42.307
Go on. I'll take care of this.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.073
- Mike broke the hubble!
<i>- Boys.</i>

28:44.100 --> 28:45.659
Mike broke the hubble!

28:57.021 --> 28:58.723
<i>Put me on intermittent, Joe.</i>

29:00.542 --> 29:03.864
- Cal, won't you reconsider?
- I did... all night.

29:04.105 --> 29:05.120
<i>Didn't you hear me?</i>

29:05.143 --> 29:07.964
And, as a committee of one, I
came to a series of decisions...

29:08.653 --> 29:10.207
at exactly
the fifth cup of coffee.

29:10.340 --> 29:11.340
<i>I had to pee.</i>

29:11.394 --> 29:14.901
One: Whatever scientific knowledge
this Exeter character has,

29:15.542 --> 29:17.311
should be
in our textbooks.

29:18.246 --> 29:21.244
Two: Joe Wilson,
my able assistant,

29:21.451 --> 29:24.353
knows enough about a certain experiment
to carry on without me for awhile.

29:24.439 --> 29:25.408
I'm not sure of that, Cal.

29:25.832 --> 29:28.346
Look, Joe, my committee decided
I'm expendable.

29:29.022 --> 29:32.311
- Nothing you can say will change that.
- You always were an obstinate—

29:32.513 --> 29:34.818
Oh, well,
I'm not worried.

29:35.103 --> 29:38.712
Not even a moth equipped with a lightning bug
could fly in here this morning.

29:38.848 --> 29:40.624
So no plane is—

29:42.342 --> 29:46.180
<i>You know, all the problems of a
hunky guy and a wormy sidekick...</i>

29:46.282 --> 29:48.604
<i>...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.</i>

29:51.079 --> 29:52.843
<i>Hey, it's a moth equipped
with a lightning bug!</i>

29:56.841 --> 29:59.173
<i>- Let go of my hand, Joe.</i>
- He made it!

29:59.975 --> 30:04.271
<i>Well, I don't like long goodbyes.
There's a letter for you on the end table.</i>

30:06.855 --> 30:10.121
<i>Joe? Joe? Watch out
for the prop, Joe...</i>

30:12.470 --> 30:15.598
<i>I'll understand if you
assist other scientist, Joe...</i>

30:20.171 --> 30:21.692
<i>Scram, Lumpy.</i>

30:24.054 --> 30:28.387
<i>Hello, Mr. Magic plane passengers.
Hello, it's outside... hello?</i>

30:32.119 --> 30:34.157
<i>Ironically, they
overbooked the flight.</i>

30:35.587 --> 30:39.558
<i>How about rustling me up
a drink, sweet cheeks? ¿Hello?</i>

30:40.293 --> 30:44.130
<i>I'm your pilot, Claude Rains;
your co-pilot, Harvey the Rabbit...</i>

30:47.236 --> 30:52.509
<i>Can I... get a pair of those little wings?
I've been a good junior pilot. Hello?</i>

30:58.149 --> 30:59.450
No pilot.

30:59.485 --> 31:01.320
<i>He must be having
a rum and coke somewhere.</i>

31:01.350 --> 31:02.354
No windows.

31:02.364 --> 31:04.556
Cal, you'll really
be flying blind.

31:04.567 --> 31:07.861
Please be seated, Dr. Meacham.
And welcome aboard.

31:07.871 --> 31:11.564
<i>You are being kidnapped
by The Light FM.</i>

31:14.803 --> 31:17.305
<i>Ugh, what are you doing?
You're sitting on me!</i>

31:17.315 --> 31:20.041
A seat belt is not
required, doctor.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.744
<i>You commie.</i>

31:22.879 --> 31:24.213
Please clear the stairs.

31:24.223 --> 31:25.615
<i>That means you, Wormy.</i>
- Thank you.

31:26.783 --> 31:29.453
So long, Joe.
I'll be dropping you a card.

31:29.464 --> 31:33.120
Cal, get off right away! This whole thing
smells to high heaven!

31:34.130 --> 31:36.262
Cal, I'm beggin' you.
Don't go!

31:36.274 --> 31:39.167
<i>Cal! Cal!
I'm stuck!</i>

31:40.636 --> 31:44.173
<i>Your in-flight movie is:</i>
Fearless.

32:04.731 --> 32:08.802
<i>There goes a stupid,
stupid man.</i>

32:11.406 --> 32:16.445
<i>I'm gonna curl up in his
sock drawer, and sleep for days.</i>

32:18.544 --> 32:22.486
<i>There's probably some kid with a big forehead,
kicking the back of the seat right now.</i>

32:25.992 --> 32:30.063
<i>Oh, Tammy, lower!
Yeah, that's right!</i>

32:30.297 --> 32:34.768
<i>Shh, shh. We're in a whole lot of trouble.
Get your parachute on. Should I wake him?</i>

32:35.770 --> 32:38.240
<i>Ah, football practice... uh...</i>

32:38.607 --> 32:40.041
Good morning,
Dr. Meacham.

32:40.052 --> 32:41.244
<i>Good morning, boys!</i>

32:41.277 --> 32:42.778
Hope you slept well.

32:42.788 --> 32:44.313
<i>'Cause it's time to die.</i>

32:45.516 --> 32:48.352
<i>They're forcing him to visit
Branson, Missouri.</i>

32:50.588 --> 32:53.992
<i>Cal, honey, put your shoes on.
We're at grandma's.</i>

32:56.262 --> 32:59.398
<i>Hello! Where can I
empty my hat?</i>

33:04.304 --> 33:07.440
<i>He's flown into
a Flemish painting</i>

33:07.842 --> 33:11.078
<i>I claim this land for Spain!</i>

33:14.619 --> 33:18.223
<i>So, the aliens live
in Hooterville?</i>

33:20.293 --> 33:23.429
<i>Ah, there are too Woodies
in this scene.</i>

33:23.439 --> 33:25.698
- Where am I?
- Georgia.

33:25.709 --> 33:27.768
I kind of expected
Neptune or Mars.

33:27.779 --> 33:29.036
<i>Or Neptune...</i>

33:29.046 --> 33:33.240
Exeter asked me to greet you.
I'm Dr. Ruth Adams.

33:33.251 --> 33:35.543
Ruth Adams! But this is wonderful.
I never expected—

33:35.554 --> 33:36.312
<i>This.</i>

33:36.322 --> 33:38.465
Ruth, I'm Cal Meacham.

33:40.472 --> 33:42.352
<i>Hello, is it anybody home?</i>

33:42.362 --> 33:44.354
Dr. Meacham,
of course.

33:45.756 --> 33:48.193
Four or five years ago, conference on...

33:48.194 --> 33:50.394
thermal problems
in nuclear reactors.

33:50.405 --> 33:52.397
- Boston, wasn't it?
- Vermont!

33:52.407 --> 33:55.167
We were lecturing to a symposium
of graduate students.

33:55.869 --> 33:58.275
Summer, three years ago.
After classes,

33:58.276 --> 34:00.773
we'd go swimming in a
little river near the school.

34:01.108 --> 34:03.210
You were an awful sissy
about that icy water.

34:03.220 --> 34:04.979
<i>Shrinky Dink,
remember?</i>

34:05.082 --> 34:06.583
Now, Ruth, don't tell me
you've forgotten.

34:06.593 --> 34:08.719
<i>Come on, dummy!
Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

34:08.728 --> 34:12.222
Dr. Meacham, all I can say
is I'm deeply flattered...

34:13.123 --> 34:16.393
and maybe a little envious of
the girl you've mistaken me for.

34:16.405 --> 34:19.197
And now I think Exeter
is waiting to greet you.

34:22.068 --> 34:24.036
<i>She wants me.</i>

34:26.574 --> 34:29.610
<i>Alright, see if this jogs
your memory.</i>

34:30.411 --> 34:32.281
<i>Bad dog.</i>

34:34.851 --> 34:37.887
<i>We did it, and
you know it.</i>

34:39.857 --> 34:41.759
<i>Mike, can I have a car
like that?</i>

34:41.793 --> 34:42.726
<i>You can't drive.</i>

34:42.735 --> 34:46.362
<i>I can drive. I'm an excellent driver.
I'm not wearing my underwear.</i>

34:48.900 --> 34:51.136
<i>Oh, there's gonna be a
Mary Kay convention going on too,</i>

34:51.331 --> 34:52.600
<i>so it's gonna be kind of weird.</i>

34:53.400 --> 34:55.784
The elevators down to
Exeter's slave quarters.

34:56.554 --> 34:57.947
Our laboratories.

34:57.957 --> 35:01.317
<i>That's not funny, Ruth.
I was a slave.</i>

35:02.586 --> 35:05.956
Our living room, social center,
library.

35:05.967 --> 35:07.358
<i>Mosh pits.</i>

35:07.368 --> 35:09.531
This is Exeter's office and study.

35:09.945 --> 35:12.534
Not exactly what you
expected, Dr. Meacham, is it?

35:12.544 --> 35:13.535
- Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning, doctors.

35:14.834 --> 35:17.403
<i>Reverend Moon.
Ms. Hathaway.</i>

35:18.872 --> 35:22.609
<i>Just throw these coats on
Exeter's bed.</i>

35:22.977 --> 35:23.837
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

35:23.838 --> 35:26.697
- Guten morgen, Doktor.
- Guten morgen, Herr Doktor.

35:28.149 --> 35:32.487
Engelberg, from Munich. The doctor's
out for his morning constitutional.

35:32.498 --> 35:36.759
He's been here a week, but
his English and my German—

35:36.793 --> 35:39.296
<i>Eeh, Charlie Rich!</i>

35:40.398 --> 35:42.767
<i>He goes through
a lot of Brylcreem.</i>

35:43.968 --> 35:46.671
<i>Don't mention his head.</i>

35:47.575 --> 35:48.776
Who's that one?

35:48.786 --> 35:52.246
That's Brack, one of
Exeter's assistants.

35:52.257 --> 35:54.616
But you'll find them all
very helpful.

35:54.627 --> 35:56.719
What language
do they speak?

35:56.729 --> 36:01.190
Anything you wish:
English, Hindustani, Congoese...

36:01.201 --> 36:02.612
<i>- Kokokupikekeke...</i>
- Anything.

36:02.736 --> 36:05.861
- Dr. Meacham. Good morning.
- Good morning.

36:06.031 --> 36:07.832
Please come in,
both of you.

36:07.842 --> 36:11.303
<i>Glad you could join us here
at the Buddy Ebsen Society</i>

36:11.704 --> 36:13.673
- Sit down.
- Dr. Adams!

36:13.856 --> 36:14.707
Oh, yes, Steve!

36:14.719 --> 36:16.276
<i>What's this
'and the rest' crap?</i>

36:16.882 --> 36:17.993
About that
nuclear decay factor, Ruth,

36:18.501 --> 36:20.969
I'm afraid my equation
just doesn't seem to work.

36:20.980 --> 36:24.254
I was hoping you could find time
to go over it with me later.

36:25.097 --> 36:27.614
I still think the
basic principle is all right.

36:27.625 --> 36:29.743
Maybe we can trust—

36:30.395 --> 36:32.249
Yes, well,
thank you, Dr. Adams.

36:36.369 --> 36:38.838
Oh, there you are,
Dr. Adams.

36:38.848 --> 36:41.171
I was just reminding
Dr. Meacham...

36:41.172 --> 36:43.944
that I'd promised to produce some
of his colleagues in the flesh.

36:44.546 --> 36:45.931
May I use you
as exhibit A?

36:45.932 --> 36:49.317
I'm afraid Dr. Meacham
isn't too happy with me.

36:49.327 --> 36:51.127
At the airport, he was
sure we were old friends.

36:51.213 --> 36:54.339
Obviously, I was wrong.
The lady hardly remembers me.

36:54.992 --> 36:58.662
- What is more important is—
- Who we are, what we're doing here.

36:58.672 --> 37:01.331
<i>Why I have a picture
of a burger on the wall.</i>

37:01.342 --> 37:02.100
Dr. Meacham...

37:02.110 --> 37:03.768
<i>We're not hiring.</i>

37:03.778 --> 37:07.222
I represent a group of scientists who
work with but one purpose:

37:07.257 --> 37:09.008
To put an end to war.

37:09.018 --> 37:13.679
Naturally, such a goal can't be attained
without experts of superior ability:

37:13.959 --> 37:16.332
- Men of vision...
<i>- Jesus, what a head...</i>

37:16.778 --> 37:18.901
...gathered here, exchanging
information daily...

37:18.910 --> 37:21.851
<i>Oh, that smell?
Oh, wow.</i>

37:22.127 --> 37:24.599
We hope to achieve
exciting new techniques,

37:25.312 --> 37:26.579
Leap years ahead of the others.

37:27.108 --> 37:29.167
- I don't think I need tell you how effective our voices...
<i>- Ah, terrible...</i>

37:29.168 --> 37:31.969
...will be when the world learns
of our achievements.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.055
- Well, there you have it.
<i>- I'll let her open her.</i>

37:35.517 --> 37:38.890
- Nothing new, perhaps, but then, what is?
<i>- Your head?</i>

37:38.900 --> 37:41.822
However, let me assure you, doctor,
that we are dedicated men and women,

37:42.416 --> 37:44.278
and as such,
we can accomplish wonders.

37:45.223 --> 37:47.421
- Well...
<i>- Into the hot tub?</i>

37:47.422 --> 37:48.876
What do you
think of us?

37:48.877 --> 37:51.480
This all sounds great,
Mr. Exeter...

37:51.753 --> 37:53.552
- ...but why me?
<i>- We like your skull.</i>

37:53.691 --> 37:54.914
- Dr. Meacham...
<i>- How.</i>

37:55.132 --> 37:57.017
...we happen to know
that you're on the threshold...

37:57.202 --> 38:00.318
of discovering limitless amounts
of free nuclear energy,

38:00.815 --> 38:03.271
More specifically, the
conversion of lead into uranium.

38:03.742 --> 38:06.295
Dr. Adams here has been working
along the same lines as you have,

38:06.296 --> 38:08.280
perhaps just
a step behind you,

38:08.982 --> 38:10.810
although I might add
that both of you are

38:10.818 --> 38:12.623
way ahead of anyone
else in your field.

38:12.863 --> 38:16.457
Be careful. Exeter will
flatter you to death.

38:16.470 --> 38:18.095
The truth is never flattering,
Dr. Adams.

38:18.105 --> 38:19.930
<i>You fine foxy lady.</i>

38:19.941 --> 38:23.020
Now suppose you relax
and think it over.

38:23.601 --> 38:27.238
Suppose when I do, I find
I can't go along with you?

38:27.242 --> 38:29.775
<i>Could we still
go out sometime?</i>

38:30.110 --> 38:33.914
Naturally, we'll expect you to be
discreet about what you've seen here.

38:33.924 --> 38:37.918
Otherwise, you're free to leave,
Dr. Meacham. As free as air.

38:43.091 --> 38:45.894
<i>Hey, Kreskin,
quit hoggin' the bottle!</i>

38:49.232 --> 38:52.468
<i>Hey, Mao, try this!
It'll knock your socks off!</i>

38:55.574 --> 38:57.876
<i>There you go,
Mr. B.</i>

38:59.210 --> 39:01.513
<i>So that's squirrel pudding,
hmm.</i>

39:03.549 --> 39:05.785
<i>Hey, the professor's crying!</i>

39:08.591 --> 39:10.893
<i>She's drunk again!</i>

39:16.267 --> 39:17.635
<i>Whatever.</i>

39:18.202 --> 39:20.972
What do you think
of Mr. Mozart, Exeter?

39:21.673 --> 39:23.108
I'm afraid I don't
know the chap.

39:23.242 --> 39:24.743
<i>I'm not an alien!</i>

39:25.778 --> 39:28.703
My mind must have been wandering.
Your composer, of course.

39:28.892 --> 39:32.204
Our composer?
He belongs to the world.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.542
Yes, indeed.

39:33.577 --> 39:34.888
<i>I'm not an alien.</i>

39:34.956 --> 39:37.031
The dinner, Exeter, was even
more perfect than you promised.

39:37.568 --> 39:40.294
Now if you'll excuse me, I could
do with some fresh air myself.

39:40.329 --> 39:41.797
<i>He's gonna get high.</i>

39:41.807 --> 39:43.496
Would you care to join me,
Dr. Adams?

39:43.500 --> 39:44.634
<i>Uh. No?</i>

39:44.645 --> 39:46.303
You, Dr. Carlson?

39:46.803 --> 39:48.572
<i>It's your turn to
walk the Cal.</i>

39:48.582 --> 39:49.773
Why don't you?

39:49.780 --> 39:50.645
Show him the grounds.

39:50.652 --> 39:51.776
<i>I dare you!</i>

39:51.786 --> 39:54.145
We won't start cracking the whip
on Meacham until tomorrow.

39:54.155 --> 39:57.352
<i>Then I ram my ovipositor down your throat
and lay my eggs in your chest.</i>

39:57.387 --> 39:59.785
<i>But I'm not an alien!</i>

40:00.522 --> 40:03.458
<i>Don't leave me with the Germans!</i>

40:06.262 --> 40:08.264
<i>They didn't eat their fruit cups!</i>

40:08.665 --> 40:12.035
- That's quite a group Exeter
has collected. - Quite.

40:12.503 --> 40:13.837
That's Dr. Hu Lin Tang.

40:13.847 --> 40:14.872
<i>I love Tang!</i>

40:14.883 --> 40:17.976
Tang's field is tritanium,
the same as Dr. Engelberg.

40:17.986 --> 40:21.146
Dr. Marie Pitchner, U-235.
Dr. Blorfield, plutonium.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.715
<i>Whoop dee shit.</i>

40:22.725 --> 40:24.750
Hmm, that puts all of us in the
production of nuclear energy,

40:24.800 --> 40:26.474
doesn't it, Carlson?

40:26.574 --> 40:27.687
What are you
getting at, Meacham?

40:27.698 --> 40:32.125
Why no biochemists, electronic experts,
mechanical engineers...

40:32.136 --> 40:36.264
People equipped to make practical application
of the energy the rest of us produce?

40:36.599 --> 40:39.190
I seem to remember that
was part of Exeter's pitch.

40:39.575 --> 40:43.273
We try to make it a rule around here, Doctor,
not to discuss our work after hours.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.403
Now how about that fresh air?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.846
How about you and Dr. Adams
showing me my laboratory instead?

40:48.858 --> 40:49.799
<i>How about you lick me?</i>

40:49.982 --> 40:51.123
After all I've heard today,
I can hardly wait...

40:51.340 --> 40:54.021
to add my little
contribution to the good work.

40:54.889 --> 40:55.890
This way, doctor.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.260
<i>- I call dibs on Ruth.
- Dibs. - Dibs! - D'oh!</i>

41:00.129 --> 41:02.331
<i>Not much of a laboratory...</i>

41:02.341 --> 41:05.268
<i>...oh, it's the elevator. I see, I get it.</i>

41:05.279 --> 41:07.838
<i>Now, does this clip
need any set up?</i>

41:08.872 --> 41:10.440
- It may be true...
<i>- You may kiss the scientist...</i>

41:10.451 --> 41:14.612
- ...but are you sure?
- We're 30 miles from nowhere.

41:14.623 --> 41:16.539
Steve and I know. We've tried.

41:16.540 --> 41:18.717
And if we did get out,
who'd believe all this?

41:18.727 --> 41:20.919
<i>Ugh, hair ball...</i>

41:25.326 --> 41:28.739
I don't blame you doctors for being excited
about working for Exeter.

41:28.829 --> 41:30.933
It's a rare privilege.
He's a rare man.

41:31.233 --> 41:34.469
Our little Neutron gave us away.
He felt the impulses.

41:34.479 --> 41:35.834
That cat. I could—

41:35.840 --> 41:38.320
Put Neutron under
the thought transformer?

41:38.787 --> 41:42.080
Why not, Brack? And perhaps
you'd like me to step in with him.

41:42.091 --> 41:44.000
<i>Smush my big white
alien forehead.</i>

41:44.016 --> 41:45.572
Turn it off, Brack.

41:45.703 --> 41:49.406
Our friends won't be giving us
any more information tonight.

41:49.606 --> 41:51.499
<i>I'll put you in the
bitch transformer...</i>

41:51.500 --> 41:52.945
Here's a sketch of the interocitor.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.556
I also have rough notes
on its working controls.

41:55.756 --> 41:57.566
It's guesswork mostly
but better than nothing.

41:57.576 --> 41:59.134
<i>Not much...</i>

41:59.144 --> 42:01.027
And these are portraits
of Exeter and Brack.

42:01.028 --> 42:04.145
Do you notice the peculiar
indentations in both their foreheads?

42:04.250 --> 42:06.990
<i>Nooo!</i>

42:07.311 --> 42:09.912
This is the one we're really proud of, Cal.

42:09.913 --> 42:13.051
We discovered this a week ago
two miles south of here.

42:13.085 --> 42:14.936
The side of this hill has been hollowed out,

42:15.086 --> 42:17.888
and here's an acre of canvas
covering the excavation.

42:18.227 --> 42:19.325
You tell me what's in there.

42:19.335 --> 42:20.493
<i>Uh, pudding?</i>

42:20.497 --> 42:24.231
Steve wanted to go back and
find out what was inside, but...

42:24.264 --> 42:25.966
I guess I got
cold feet.

42:25.979 --> 42:28.639
Just like Vermont.
Still a sissy.

42:28.649 --> 42:30.150
<i>God, I hate you.</i>

42:30.160 --> 42:31.168
They're fine, Steve.

42:31.170 --> 42:32.620
When we get out of here,
I'll have them framed at my own expense.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.746
If we get out.

42:34.780 --> 42:38.517
<i>Ah, you sissy. Sissy cat,
I can take you too, you puss!</i>

42:38.527 --> 42:39.985
He's just hungry.

42:39.996 --> 42:43.990
<i>No, please! I can't
digest milk!</i>

42:45.693 --> 42:47.428
Good-bye, Neutron.

42:47.595 --> 42:51.599
<i>I've got some big foreheaded
sissy butt to kick.</i>

42:51.605 --> 42:56.003
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Howell's hut
is really nice.</i>

43:02.563 --> 43:04.835
<i>Yeah, let's slip away
undercover of afternoon</i>

43:04.836 --> 43:06.868
<i>in the biggest car in the county.</i>

43:10.022 --> 43:13.326
Good. You will keep in contact
until moment of departure.

43:13.336 --> 43:16.629
Then remove all evidence
of installation. That is all.

43:16.642 --> 43:18.901
<i>And don't forget
to punch out.</i>

43:22.238 --> 43:23.755
<i>I ought to hit you.</i>

43:23.762 --> 43:24.725
Take over.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.378
<i>And don't screw it up.
Jerk.</i>

43:27.388 --> 43:30.915
<i>Now, it's time for The Brak Show.</i>

43:31.550 --> 43:33.385
<i>It's The Brak Show,
starring me— I'm Brak.</i>

43:33.986 --> 43:36.154
<i>It's The Brak Show and
I've got lots of great guests.</i>

43:38.591 --> 43:43.062
<i>Meanwhile, Ness and his men
speed toward Capone's hideout!</i>

43:44.264 --> 43:48.702
<i>So, Professor, you made this
entirely out of bamboo, huh?</i>

43:49.437 --> 43:51.940
<i>Eat my photons,
smallheads!</i>

43:55.445 --> 43:57.881
<i>Why are they all
sitting in front?</i>

43:57.891 --> 43:59.105
We're sitting ducks in this thing.

43:59.364 --> 44:01.652
If we're gonna make the airport,
we'll have to do it on foot.

44:01.663 --> 44:03.287
When I stop, we'll pile out.
Take cover fast.

44:03.297 --> 44:06.424
<i>Sounds like a really crappy plan,
but okay!</i>

44:14.336 --> 44:16.471
<i>Suckers!</i>

44:18.274 --> 44:19.976
Steve! Steve!

44:19.987 --> 44:22.479
<i>I'm a little busy!</i>

44:24.616 --> 44:26.885
<i>I regret nothing!</i>

44:28.320 --> 44:29.988
<i>Uh, yes,
very nice, yes!</i>

44:30.990 --> 44:33.125
<i>Oh, I have
tubes in my ears!</i>

44:33.135 --> 44:37.296
<i>And his coffin will be made
entirely of coconuts, thank you.</i>

44:37.664 --> 44:40.967
We'll try and make
the airport. Let's go.

44:40.978 --> 44:43.571
<i>Well, they dried
off quickly.</i>

44:43.581 --> 44:46.040
<i>Heh hey,
watch the hand, Cal!</i>

44:47.810 --> 44:50.346
<i>Regis and Kathy Lee are</i>
The Fugitive.

44:50.357 --> 44:52.482
- Is it flyable?
- It should be.

44:52.492 --> 44:54.751
Exeter keeps it
here for the staff.

44:58.891 --> 45:00.960
<i>She's hard on a
cocktail dress.</i>

45:01.395 --> 45:04.098
<i>My other plane
is a jet, you know?</i>

45:04.108 --> 45:05.933
<i>What do you think
about that?</i>

45:07.335 --> 45:10.705
<i>That's what happens when
you leave a potato in a microwave!</i>

45:12.875 --> 45:16.412
<i>Yeah, I'm beginning to think
they're not from around here.</i>

45:18.048 --> 45:21.018
<i>I bet you they're
English, or Canadian.</i>

45:21.185 --> 45:22.420
They're pulling us up!

45:22.430 --> 45:25.490
<i>I just know they're
gonna probe my anus.</i>

45:26.158 --> 45:30.863
<i>¡Captain, the Klingons have us
in their tractor beam!</i>

45:35.302 --> 45:38.539
<i>They got sucked up
into a Jiffy Lube.</i>

45:39.741 --> 45:42.411
<i>So, this is Denver's
new airport.</i>

45:42.678 --> 45:45.681
<i>Yes, things are going
exactly as planned.</i>

45:48.542 --> 45:49.966
<i>If I don't miss my guess,</i>

45:50.139 --> 45:53.099
<i>I think this has something to do
with those white-haired fellows.</i>

45:54.226 --> 45:56.929
<i>Ah, thank you, Thing.</i>

46:00.535 --> 46:04.272
<i>So, they worship
the Everlasting Gobstopper?</i>

46:09.378 --> 46:13.549
<i>You know, those helmets don't really
hide their foreheads that well.</i>

46:14.752 --> 46:16.754
<i>Two for Dinner?
Good.</i>

46:16.774 --> 46:18.489
Remain here.

46:19.858 --> 46:22.327
<i>Dad, your friends
are here!</i>

46:23.186 --> 46:24.930
Our two passengers are
very sensitive to heat.

46:25.044 --> 46:26.389
The passengers are here.

46:26.589 --> 46:29.002
<i>So why they put the toilet
in the middle of the room?</i>

46:30.504 --> 46:32.106
Allow me
to welcome you.

46:32.116 --> 46:33.273
<i>Welcome.</i>

46:33.440 --> 46:37.481
I'm sorry that our visit below had
to be terminated so dramatically,

46:37.482 --> 46:39.366
but time allowed
for nothing else.

46:39.459 --> 46:41.184
I can assure you
we mean you no harm.

46:41.195 --> 46:43.788
Like Steve Carlson and Engelborg?
Like the others in that house?

46:44.122 --> 46:47.458
- What happened was beyond my control.
- What happened was mass murder.

46:47.693 --> 46:49.828
We're not all masters of our souls, Meacham.

46:49.829 --> 46:52.164
That's a nice little phrase
coming from you.

46:52.175 --> 46:53.433
I learned it
on Earth.

46:53.443 --> 46:55.135
<i>That's 1 for Exeter. Ouch!</i>

46:56.704 --> 46:59.006
The two of you are
beginning a strange journey...

46:59.016 --> 47:00.007
<i>Mawwige!</i>

47:00.018 --> 47:02.511
a journey that no Earth people
have ever undertaken before.

47:03.011 --> 47:05.847
Whether you consider me a devil
or a saint is unimportant.

47:05.858 --> 47:06.625
<i>Devil.</i>

47:06.626 --> 47:09.619
What is important is that you're here,
on this spaceship.

47:10.187 --> 47:13.590
Suppose then, for the
time being, we call a truce.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.592
As scientists
at least, Meacham.

47:15.694 --> 47:18.163
<i>Isn't he sitting too close
to the TV?</i>

47:18.196 --> 47:21.099
Ruth, don't tell me that, as a woman,
you're not curious about our destination.

47:21.110 --> 47:22.735
<i>Having a sale, Ruth!</i>

47:22.745 --> 47:23.602
Where are
we going?

47:23.612 --> 47:25.204
<i>Are we there yet?</i>

47:25.217 --> 47:27.976
- To a planet we call Metaluna.
- Metaluna?

47:28.043 --> 47:30.520
There's no such planet in the solar system.

47:30.521 --> 47:32.348
Metaluna lies far beyond your
solar system, in outer space.

47:34.050 --> 47:36.134
The stellarscope
will convince you.

47:36.247 --> 47:36.963
Come.

47:36.964 --> 47:41.279
<i>Well, I never Metaluna I didn't like.
What do you think, Ruth? Pretty good, ah?</i>

47:42.227 --> 47:45.263
Observer, prepare a view
of the second quadrant, please.

47:45.470 --> 47:46.905
<i>Nanoo.</i>

47:48.000 --> 47:49.936
I won't ask you to
condone what we've done.

47:49.947 --> 47:50.971
<i>We condone it.</i>

47:50.981 --> 47:53.930
All I ask is that when you
understand the plight of my people,

47:53.931 --> 47:56.878
you try to have more
sympathy for our deeds.

47:56.898 --> 47:59.414
<i>And that you'll give
generously to the United Way.</i>

48:00.149 --> 48:03.119
- Earth.
- It's being left far behind.

48:03.386 --> 48:05.688
<i>My interocitor is way nicer
than that one.</i>

48:05.699 --> 48:06.857
<i>You have an interocitor?</i>

48:06.867 --> 48:07.532
<i>Sure. Don't you?</i>

48:07.796 --> 48:11.161
<i>- Well. Come on! We can use it to get
back to Earth. - Really?</i>

48:11.262 --> 48:13.965
<i>You've got an interocitor.
You should tell me these things!</i>

48:14.634 --> 48:16.914
Interocitor. Interocitor. Let's see here.

48:17.059 --> 48:19.200
Under the peanut brittle.
Nope, nope...

48:19.313 --> 48:22.501
Let's see. A Monkeys album,
shoestring potatoes.

48:22.645 --> 48:26.543
Hey! A can of hamdingers, isn't it?
No interocitor. A spirograph...

48:26.743 --> 48:28.584
I know it's around here,
somewhere.

48:29.842 --> 48:32.595
...a sweatsock there.
Oh, there's my Etch-A-Sketch!

48:32.746 --> 48:36.531
Trackball, never worked. A jar of tamales.
Another can of hamdingers...

48:36.660 --> 48:38.663
Why all the underpants?
They're... full?

48:39.464 --> 48:40.899
Oh, these.

48:40.910 --> 48:43.155
- I collect them.
- Huh.

48:43.284 --> 48:45.471
Hey, a chainsaw!

48:45.482 --> 48:48.542
Wait a second, Servo.
You do have a interocitor.

48:49.777 --> 48:51.713
I've been using it to
make hot chocolate.

48:52.346 --> 48:54.415
Well, let's see what
this baby can do.

49:00.056 --> 49:02.358
- Would you take those off?
- Hey!

49:04.880 --> 49:08.542
She'll be ridin'
six white horses...

49:14.041 --> 49:16.237
Man, you guys scared the
living daylights out of me!

49:16.272 --> 49:18.979
It's working! Hey, hi!
It's Exeter there?

49:19.347 --> 49:21.948
Nah, him and Brack went down to
Headbutt Days for Shelly.

49:21.949 --> 49:23.981
I gotta meet 'em in the beer tent in
about fifteen minutes,

49:23.982 --> 49:25.454
so I gotta get going, 'kay?

49:25.465 --> 49:28.625
No wait, we're trapped in space!
Can we use this thing to get back to Earth?

49:29.292 --> 49:30.527
I don't know.

49:30.538 --> 49:33.398
Jees. Let's see.
Maybe this does something.

49:36.201 --> 49:37.870
Crap. That's not it.

49:37.880 --> 49:38.837
Hang up.

49:42.609 --> 49:45.479
Okay. Did you use the
intensifier disk?

49:45.679 --> 49:46.870
Yes!

49:47.070 --> 49:49.456
Turned the controls
18 degrees to the left.

49:49.623 --> 49:50.722
Did that.

49:50.922 --> 49:53.489
Are you in Europe.
Do you need an adapter?

49:53.664 --> 49:54.689
No.

49:54.736 --> 49:57.729
Well look, I don't know
anything about this thing.

49:57.962 --> 49:59.831
Maybe this does something.

50:01.784 --> 50:02.581
Oops. It didn't work.

50:02.735 --> 50:05.015
Okay, well, I'll be sure to tell
Exeter to give you a call...

50:05.198 --> 50:06.577
- Bye! - No wait! Hold on!
You have to help us!

50:06.738 --> 50:09.393
Wait, help!
Auntie Em! Auntie Em!

50:09.485 --> 50:10.410
Surprise!

50:10.421 --> 50:13.781
Like, who doesn't have an interocitor,
you collective heads of knuckle!

50:13.791 --> 50:16.143
Now, get back in the theater,
you ninnyhammers!

50:16.305 --> 50:21.757
And remember: I know who you are,
and I saw what you did. Now, scat!

50:21.768 --> 50:25.261
I'm the God!
I'm the God!

50:31.503 --> 50:35.941
<i>Ah! They're going 75, so
they'll be there in three billion years.</i>

50:36.676 --> 50:38.177
Follow me,
if you will.

50:38.187 --> 50:40.625
Exeter, what are you using for power?

50:40.626 --> 50:42.961
How are you controlling the
fantastic temperature on this ship?

50:43.330 --> 50:46.599
What's to prevent us from floating around
like a bunch of balloons once we leave Earth's gravity?

50:46.990 --> 50:48.425
To answer
the last question first:

50:48.435 --> 50:49.426
<i>Shut up.</i>

50:49.436 --> 50:52.696
we create our own
gravitational field, which means that...

50:52.707 --> 50:54.885
no matter what position
our ship takes in space,

50:54.956 --> 50:57.336
we here inside remain
right side up.

50:57.536 --> 51:01.473
But if we're going to get you
to Metaluna alive,

51:01.484 --> 51:04.177
there's a little procedure
you'll have to go through.

51:04.187 --> 51:05.880
<i>Oh, yeah! My anal probe!</i>

51:06.048 --> 51:07.058
What are you
doing to them?

51:07.187 --> 51:08.857
<i>We're hickory-curing them.</i>

51:09.787 --> 51:12.873
Metaluna's atmospheric pressure is like
that in your greatest oceans.

51:12.884 --> 51:13.611
<i>Just like you.</i>

51:13.612 --> 51:17.654
If we entered Metaluna's orbit without
conversion, we'd be crushed to death.

51:18.100 --> 51:21.795
But in going from Metaluna to Earth,
the tissues of our bodies would dwindle.

51:22.022 --> 51:23.845
We'd disintegrate
completely.

51:24.184 --> 51:25.841
- Correct, Meacham,
<i>- You get a cookie.</i>

51:26.189 --> 51:28.328
If we're fortunate enough
to return to Earth.

51:28.408 --> 51:30.340
<i>So, you're not giving us
a ride back then?</i>

51:32.349 --> 51:34.713
<i>Okay, Bachelor Number Two...</i>

51:35.884 --> 51:38.387
<i>Which one do you
want, honey?</i>

51:38.487 --> 51:42.157
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...
A Flock of Seagulls.</i>

51:44.527 --> 51:48.932
<i>Jees, I hope they wipe down
the tubes when they're done with them.</i>

51:49.533 --> 51:52.737
<i>Uh, yeah. Good meeting, everyone.
Same time tomorrow?</i>

51:52.748 --> 51:54.473
- Brack?
- Yes.

51:54.707 --> 51:56.709
You will prepare the doctors
for the tubes.

51:56.719 --> 51:58.444
<i>I just got out of
the tub, man!</i>

51:58.454 --> 52:03.127
You'll change into clothes such as ours,
especially conditioned for life on Metaluna.

52:03.201 --> 52:04.151
Come with me.

52:04.161 --> 52:06.587
<i>What size of skull-dome
do you wear?</i>

52:08.656 --> 52:11.893
<i>Brack has visible panty line.</i>

52:12.104 --> 52:16.031
<i>Come on, you couple of
single-stomach, microcephalic bilobes.</i>

52:17.400 --> 52:20.170
<i>So, Brack.
Is that polish?</i>

52:20.181 --> 52:21.939
<i>Or... well no,
I guess it wouldn't be.</i>

52:23.474 --> 52:26.244
<i>There's a shuttlecraft
approaching, Captain.</i>

52:26.257 --> 52:29.476
<i>- Do you want me to talk like
George Takei some more Mike? - No.</i>

52:29.687 --> 52:31.910
<i>As you wish, Captain.
As you wish.</i>

52:34.089 --> 52:36.091
<i>Recognize me now,
Ruth?</i>

52:36.102 --> 52:38.069
Place your hands above the rails.

52:39.786 --> 52:40.831
They're magnetized.

52:40.841 --> 52:43.967
<i>And if your hands were metal,
that would mean something.</i>

52:46.304 --> 52:47.372
<i>What?</i>

52:47.382 --> 52:51.142
There's an intercom system in the tubes.
You may converse as long as you're able to.

52:51.149 --> 52:54.880
<i>But it will be billed to your room,
so don't overuse it.</i>

52:56.116 --> 52:58.919
<i>Now, raise your hand
if you want the hot wax</i>

53:01.255 --> 53:03.724
<i>I hope you
both like sulfur!</i>

53:07.663 --> 53:09.331
<i>Good luck!
Let me know what happens!</i>

53:09.341 --> 53:13.302
<i>What do you know!
Mine smells like bacon!</i>

53:13.970 --> 53:16.940
<i>Must feel like
they're inside a bong!</i>

53:19.813 --> 53:21.915
- Ruth?
<i>- I farted.</i>

53:21.925 --> 53:22.749
Yes?

53:22.759 --> 53:24.618
You okay?

53:24.628 --> 53:26.253
And you?

53:27.222 --> 53:28.990
Feel like
a new toothbrush.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.893
<i>So rub me in a
circular motion on your gums</i>

53:32.561 --> 53:36.298
<i>Hey, a big Swedish
underarm crystal</i>

53:41.439 --> 53:45.476
<i>Hey, keep it on the road!
We're in the tubes back here!</i>

53:47.479 --> 53:49.815
<i>Uh, my contents
have shifted!</i>

53:52.463 --> 53:55.255
- Ruth—
<i>- I farted again.</i>

53:58.492 --> 54:01.395
<i>Well, this ought to
kill them!</i>

54:04.735 --> 54:07.271
<i>I </i> am <i> Metaluna.</i>

54:11.010 --> 54:14.613
<i>Well, the Tangerine Dream
music is good.</i>

54:19.085 --> 54:22.522
<i>It's Christy Turlington
and Kate Moss!</i>

54:23.724 --> 54:28.129
<i>Oh gross!
I saw Cal's pubic bone!</i>

54:30.333 --> 54:32.602
<i>¡Now you're playing
Simon!</i>

54:33.837 --> 54:36.573
<i>Should I tell Ruth
she has an extra rib?</i>

54:41.481 --> 54:44.116
- Cal—
<i>- I farted.</i>

54:44.126 --> 54:49.655
Enemy-controlled sector. This is
master control awaiting instructions.

54:49.666 --> 54:52.126
<i>Bill, pick up line 4!</i>

54:54.128 --> 54:56.730
<i>Jesus, what did
you do to them?</i>

54:57.834 --> 55:01.263
You'll energize only as necessary.
Conserve power.

55:01.612 --> 55:04.181
Avoid contact with enemy until
safety of ship is endangered.

55:04.342 --> 55:07.945
<i>Make big money at home!
Sharpen saws, and earn extra cash.</i>

55:08.347 --> 55:10.916
<i>You didn't see my skeleton,
did you?</i>

55:13.219 --> 55:16.055
<i>Uh, you might want to wait
a minute before opening Cal's up</i>

55:18.259 --> 55:21.295
<i>Did you have Kenny G
playing in your tube?</i>

55:22.397 --> 55:24.599
<i>Come away from
the nasty man.</i>

55:24.801 --> 55:27.003
You'll feel stronger
in a few moments.

55:27.503 --> 55:31.607
<i>I feel safe with you Brack.
You have a gentle touch.</i>

55:33.043 --> 55:37.147
Now I know you both feel as though
you could sleep for at least a thousand years,

55:37.916 --> 55:41.820
But then you'd miss observing
our approach to Metaluna,

55:41.831 --> 55:46.392
And with your curiosity, you'd
never forgive me for that.

55:46.405 --> 55:51.333
<i>You know, our chair technology
is light years ahead of yours.</i>

55:53.169 --> 55:56.372
<i>Quiet everyone!
All My Children is on.</i>

55:57.608 --> 56:01.245
<i>Hey, Laser Floyd, cool!</i>

56:01.256 --> 56:03.181
Observer,
a closer view.

56:04.516 --> 56:08.687
View in third quadrant.
Contact in two time periods.

56:08.696 --> 56:12.859
<i>This planet should comb
its hair over its bald spot.</i>

56:14.161 --> 56:18.365
View in second quadrant.
Contact in one time period.

56:18.376 --> 56:22.070
<i>You know, that's one butt-ugly
planet you guys come from.</i>

56:22.081 --> 56:23.739
View in first quadrant
at ionization wave.

56:24.540 --> 56:26.743
<i>Ew, it's Michael Stipe's head!</i>

56:26.776 --> 56:29.579
What you're observing may well be
the beginning of the end... for our world.

56:29.714 --> 56:31.149
<i>Well, I hope so!</i>

56:31.159 --> 56:33.641
The Zahgon meteors are beginning
to get through our ionized layer.

56:33.676 --> 56:36.120
That haze, a feeling
of intense radiation.

56:36.757 --> 56:38.967
As you can well imagine,
such a screen requires...

56:38.968 --> 56:40.861
the output of great
amounts of atomic energy.

56:41.963 --> 56:44.766
And you're running out.
That's why you were sent to Earth.

56:44.777 --> 56:47.543
And why you sent for us.
You need uranium.

56:47.607 --> 56:52.341
In gigantic quantities.
Our own deposits are exhausted.

56:52.352 --> 56:54.945
As our power diminishes,
our protection fails.

56:54.956 --> 56:58.183
<i>But, uh, we do have a very
active theater community!</i>

56:59.551 --> 57:02.754
<i>What kind of shithole
planet is this?</i>

57:05.759 --> 57:08.662
That's enough.
Normal view.

57:08.995 --> 57:14.317
<i>Normal view.
Normal view.</i>

57:14.700 --> 57:21.686
<i>Normal view!
Normal view!</i>

57:22.580 --> 57:24.581
Entering ionized layer.

57:25.952 --> 57:29.956
<i>Hey, they're landing in
Tommy Chong's backyard.</i>

57:37.599 --> 57:40.668
<i>Oh, my washer load
is off-balance!</i>

57:41.203 --> 57:44.573
<i>Looks like Dr. Seuss
designed their planet.</i>

57:44.941 --> 57:47.577
<i>They're flying into a
Roger Dean album cover.</i>

57:47.587 --> 57:50.580
<i>They're very into Yes
in this planet.</i>

57:54.152 --> 57:58.723
<i>International flights always get
the gate furthest from the terminal.</i>

57:59.525 --> 58:04.263
<i>Remember, we're parked
in the Denubrian Slime Devil lot.</i>

58:08.169 --> 58:10.871
<i>Hey, Prince's bedroom.</i>

58:14.643 --> 58:17.913
<i>Looks like the stalls
are all taken.</i>

58:17.926 --> 58:22.620
Welcome, Exeter. Observed your flight.
Almost counted you lost.

58:22.655 --> 58:24.623
Your Earth creatures.

58:24.980 --> 58:28.028
Dr. Adams,
Dr. Meacham.

58:28.261 --> 58:30.411
I've given them as much
indoctrination as possible.

58:30.559 --> 58:31.749
Then you know that shortly...

58:31.839 --> 58:35.015
we can expect Zahgon to commence
and sustain an all-out attack.

58:35.571 --> 58:40.142
Our ionization layer must be maintained
until our relocation is effected.

58:40.153 --> 58:42.011
Relocation?
To where?

58:42.679 --> 58:44.047
<i>Shut your gob,
small-head.</i>

58:44.057 --> 58:45.014
To your Earth.

58:45.149 --> 58:47.117
<i>Oh, I can see th...
hey!</i>

58:47.127 --> 58:48.219
A peaceful relocation.

58:48.229 --> 58:50.187
<i>After the genocide,
of course.</i>

58:50.198 --> 58:51.275
Do you still insist, Exeter,

58:51.442 --> 58:55.787
that we can allow any of these
Earth creatures to have free minds?

58:55.987 --> 58:56.661
I do.

58:56.662 --> 58:58.264
<i>No... Yes...
Whatever you think!</i>

58:58.274 --> 58:59.499
I know them.

58:59.665 --> 59:00.766
<i>I've partied
with them.</i>

59:00.777 --> 59:03.808
- I've lived with them.
- You have wasted our time.

59:03.951 --> 59:07.207
<i>- Thank you!</i> - Take them
to the thought transference chamber.

59:07.711 --> 59:10.413
<i>Yes, you all-high toilet hog.</i>

59:11.916 --> 59:15.286
Please come with me. I'm afraid
you have no choice.

59:15.654 --> 59:18.857
<i>Okay. Bye bye!
Nice hannukah bush, by the way!</i>

59:23.096 --> 59:26.578
<i>Ah, I see their
Patriots don't work either.</i>

59:28.335 --> 59:32.331
Our Zahgon friends seem to be hitting this
prime sector quite regularly.

59:32.374 --> 59:33.441
<i>Uh, yeah?</i>

59:33.445 --> 59:36.111
Is that where it is?
In there?

59:38.981 --> 59:42.118
<i>Uh, golly, those doggone Zahgons are
really licking us, huh?</i>

59:42.129 --> 59:45.956
<i>Well, let's go get your
brains scrambled.</i>

59:46.791 --> 59:48.826
My mind is my own and
nobody's gonna change it.

59:48.836 --> 59:50.094
<i>Go, girl!</i>

59:50.105 --> 59:52.898
- I'm not going into that room!
- Nobody is. Come on!

59:54.099 --> 59:55.601
<i>Leona Helmsley!</i>

59:55.614 --> 59:57.606
I'm sorry.

59:58.006 --> 01:00:01.643
I'd hoped to have prepared you somewhat
beforehand. This is a mutant.

01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:04.013
We have been bringing them
here for ages to do menial work.

01:00:04.023 --> 01:00:04.948
<i>Why?</i>

01:00:04.959 --> 01:00:07.447
Thhey're similar to insect life
on your own planet.

01:00:07.448 --> 01:00:10.388
Larger, of course, with a
higher degree of intelligence.

01:00:10.398 --> 01:00:12.921
This one has been given orders to
guard this corridor as long as we're here.

01:00:12.924 --> 01:00:14.125
<i>Oh, mommy!</i>

01:00:14.492 --> 01:00:17.329
I beg of you, go inside.
Cooperate voluntarily.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.167
I give you my word you will not be harmed
or your minds changed in any way.

01:00:21.178 --> 01:00:24.004
- You'd defy the Monitor?
- I already have!

01:00:24.137 --> 01:00:25.364
Do you believe him, Cal?

01:00:25.468 --> 01:00:26.976
In this place,
I wouldn't believe my grandmother.

01:00:30.499 --> 01:00:32.882
<i>Is he wearing slacks?</i>

01:00:34.357 --> 01:00:35.702
<i>Oh boy.</i>

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.989
<i>The kingdom!</i>

01:00:41.759 --> 01:00:46.865
<i>Oh sure. Go on. Run.
Just because you have a skull.</i>

01:00:47.868 --> 01:00:50.971
<i>The Jetsons 2:
After the Armageddon.</i>

01:00:54.576 --> 01:00:57.123
- The travel car! Come on!
- Where are we going?

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:58.915
The spaceship.
It's safer there.

01:00:59.148 --> 01:01:01.484
Don't you understand?
Let it happen now.

01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:02.686
<i>Reeeally?</i>

01:01:02.886 --> 01:01:04.254
Meacham!
Ruth!

01:01:04.264 --> 01:01:05.589
<i>I love you!</i>

01:01:06.858 --> 01:01:08.626
Stand back, Exeter.

01:01:09.394 --> 01:01:11.496
Meacham, believe me,
I want to help you.

01:01:11.507 --> 01:01:13.199
<i>You're holding
a mutant turd!</i>

01:01:13.209 --> 01:01:15.568
Time is short.
Get into the car!

01:01:15.579 --> 01:01:17.671
<i>Go ahead.
Move that baby seat.</i>

01:01:17.681 --> 01:01:20.040
<i>I kind of live
out of my travel cart.</i>

01:01:25.247 --> 01:01:28.584
<i>This is what went on in
Salvador Dali's head.</i>

01:01:32.088 --> 01:01:34.958
<i>Now, I swear we parked on
level C, just right next to...</i>

01:01:34.971 --> 01:01:36.529
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

01:01:38.631 --> 01:01:41.634
He appears badly hurt.
Stay close to me.

01:01:41.721 --> 01:01:45.656
<i>Guten Tag! Sie greten?
Wie wollen eine Auto mieten!</i>

01:01:45.907 --> 01:01:47.609
Stand back.

01:01:48.476 --> 01:01:50.812
I command you:
stand back!

01:01:51.046 --> 01:01:52.615
<i>Acting!</i>

01:01:54.851 --> 01:01:57.053
<i>Well, that seemed
to go rather well.</i>

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.422
<i>I don't see what could
possibly go wrong...</i>

01:02:03.361 --> 01:02:06.397
- Cal!
<i>- No, you do it! Leave me alone!</i>

01:02:07.165 --> 01:02:08.734
<i>Uh, I'll get coffee.</i>

01:02:10.103 --> 01:02:13.873
<i>Oh, I'm very vulnerable there!
Oh, there goes the piano lessons!</i>

01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:16.242
<i>Ah, I can't remember
my dad!</i>

01:02:16.253 --> 01:02:18.913
<i>Oh, come on
you big blowed.</i>

01:02:18.923 --> 01:02:22.283
<i>When in Chicago, visit
the Museum of Science and Industry.</i>

01:02:22.294 --> 01:02:25.086
- Are you badly hurt?
- I'll be all right.

01:02:25.633 --> 01:02:29.127
Close off all hatches.
Control room, quick!

01:02:29.795 --> 01:02:33.511
<i>Everyone picks on that
one weak spot of my exoskeleton!</i>

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:36.769
<i>You dinks.
You crushed my nads.</i>

01:02:39.206 --> 01:02:42.409
<i>Hey! The floors look great.</i>

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.181
I'm all right.

01:02:46.191 --> 01:02:50.852
<i>And if you don't mind
I've been waiting all day for this.</i>

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:00.531
<i>Oh no, Tinkerbell's goin' down!
Pull up Tink!</i>

01:03:02.434 --> 01:03:03.535
That may be
the last of them.

01:03:03.545 --> 01:03:05.637
<i>But probably it isn't.</i>

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.543
Yes, they're concentrating
all their attention on Metaluna.

01:03:11.245 --> 01:03:14.715
Those flashes of light...
they're meteors.

01:03:14.725 --> 01:03:16.216
Hundreds of them.

01:03:16.753 --> 01:03:20.523
The intense heat is turning Metaluna
into a radioactive sun.

01:03:20.534 --> 01:03:23.261
The temperature must be
thousands of degrees by now.

01:03:23.271 --> 01:03:24.762
<i>Cooler by the lake.</i>

01:03:24.773 --> 01:03:26.632
- A lifeless planet.
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

01:03:27.066 --> 01:03:28.075
And yet—

01:03:28.076 --> 01:03:29.501
<i>Rents are
reasonable.</i>

01:03:29.511 --> 01:03:32.504
...it's still serving
a useful purpose, I hope.

01:03:33.606 --> 01:03:35.675
- Yes, a Sun...
<i>- Yes, yes.</i>

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:38.145
warming the surface
of some other world,

01:03:38.913 --> 01:03:40.681
giving light to those
who may need it.

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:43.652
<i>Still, your whole family died.
That's a bummer, huh?</i>

01:03:44.019 --> 01:03:45.921
Now, into
the converter tubes.

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.685
<i>Uh, your liver is beginning
to stick out there.</i>

01:03:48.874 --> 01:03:49.877
<i>You might wanna tuck it back in.</i>

01:03:52.095 --> 01:03:55.365
- Ruth, you take the first tube.
You, the next. - What about you?

01:03:55.376 --> 01:03:56.834
I'll use the third tube.

01:03:56.844 --> 01:03:59.404
<i>Oh, right. Sure.
Stupid question. Sorry.</i>

01:04:01.607 --> 01:04:04.109
<i>Well. One weird day,
huh?</i>

01:04:04.443 --> 01:04:07.212
<i>Captain's log:
A bunch of our ship fell off and...</i>

01:04:07.282 --> 01:04:08.850
<i>nobody likes me.</i>

01:04:11.788 --> 01:04:15.892
<i>Cal and Exeter
wake and bake everyday. Woo!</i>

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:24.936
<i>Will our Mystery Guest enter
and sign in please?</i>

01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:32.245
<i>It's the manager here?
Hello?</i>

01:04:34.983 --> 01:04:37.552
<i>I hear you, ma'am.
Walls melting for you, too?</i>

01:04:37.685 --> 01:04:41.022
<i>I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm just looking for the can.</i>

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:45.327
<i>Say, where did you
get those cute pants?</i>

01:04:46.997 --> 01:04:48.732
<i>Oh, hey.
My grandma's legs.</i>

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:55.933
Exeter, are these tubes
strong enough to keep him out?

01:04:55.986 --> 01:04:56.620
Possibly.

01:04:56.650 --> 01:04:58.197
<i>- Well, no.</i>
- He's bleeding badly.

01:04:58.232 --> 01:05:01.916
In a very few moments,
the pressure should destroy him.

01:05:05.721 --> 01:05:08.758
<i>Shall I compare thee to a
summer's d— oh...</i>

01:05:12.229 --> 01:05:15.999
<i>Okay. Hold it together.
Rise above it. Suck it up.</i>

01:05:17.902 --> 01:05:20.338
<i>You gotta cut me Mick!
Cut me!</i>

01:05:22.508 --> 01:05:25.945
<i>And I busted a zit
on my shoulder. Great!</i>

01:05:27.447 --> 01:05:28.782
Run, Ruth, run!

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:31.184
<i>Brilliant strategy.
Thanks, Napoleon.</i>

01:05:32.253 --> 01:05:34.288
<i>Oh, I've ought
to do something.</i>

01:05:36.325 --> 01:05:39.795
<i>What are you stuck up?
Too high and mighty for the Mutant, huh?</i>

01:05:41.297 --> 01:05:43.266
<i>C'mon!
Give Uncle Scrotor a hug!</i>

01:05:46.172 --> 01:05:49.575
<i>Not since Ted Kennedy
in a Barney suit!</i>

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:56.853
<i>- Oh, I stood up too fast!
- Ugh, he squirted.</i>

01:05:56.985 --> 01:05:59.587
<i>Thank God I saved you.</i>

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:02.891
<i>Ah, I fell on my keys.</i>

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:08.932
<i>Yes, go away, you bad monster,
you'll get more of the same!</i>

01:06:08.942 --> 01:06:10.467
<i>Self-cleaning mutant.</i>

01:06:10.478 --> 01:06:13.738
<i>Leaves only the fresh
scent of pine.</i>

01:06:15.274 --> 01:06:17.276
<i>Oh, we'll get you another one.</i>

01:06:20.013 --> 01:06:23.583
<i>Raspberry World, for all your
raspberry needs. Off the beltway.</i>

01:06:25.486 --> 01:06:28.589
<i>Hey, check this out!
Baywatch is on.</i>

01:06:29.256 --> 01:06:33.227
<i>- Ah, just like we left it.
With the USA in charge. - Yes!</i>

01:06:34.496 --> 01:06:36.665
<i>I think maybe we should
slow down a little?</i>

01:06:36.678 --> 01:06:38.336
Our speed is diminishing.

01:06:38.346 --> 01:06:40.872
We're now in the
atmosphere of Earth.

01:06:41.173 --> 01:06:43.309
Your plane is where you left it:
in the cargo hold.

01:06:43.475 --> 01:06:44.743
<i>I think.</i>

01:06:44.753 --> 01:06:47.479
A conventional way for you
to return to Earth, I admit,

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:48.882
<i>At least you've got a planet.</i>

01:06:48.892 --> 01:06:50.317
but perhaps
the most practical.

01:06:50.328 --> 01:06:52.987
<i>May your forehead grow
like the mighty oak.</i>

01:06:52.997 --> 01:06:54.422
Where are
you going?

01:06:54.432 --> 01:06:56.891
<i>I'm fine.
I'll just kick around here.</i>

01:06:56.902 --> 01:06:59.161
Our universe is vast,

01:06:59.361 --> 01:07:01.096
full of wonders.

01:07:01.531 --> 01:07:02.699
I'll explore.

01:07:02.709 --> 01:07:03.900
<i>Yeah, that's it!</i>

01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:05.838
Perhaps find another Metaluna,

01:07:05.839 --> 01:07:09.273
a place inhabited by beings
not unlike myself.

01:07:09.283 --> 01:07:11.442
<i>Maybe get a house,
with some guys... I don't know...</i>

01:07:11.453 --> 01:07:13.678
You see, I'm more adventurous
than you imagined me.

01:07:14.733 --> 01:07:16.315
- Exeter...
<i>- You dog...</i>

01:07:16.325 --> 01:07:18.150
- ...you're a liar.
<i>- ...and I hate you.</i>

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.186
You've used all your power
bringing us here.

01:07:20.197 --> 01:07:22.796
Even if you had a place to go,
you couldn't make it.

01:07:22.867 --> 01:07:24.100
<i>I'll gas up in
Des Moines.</i>

01:07:24.134 --> 01:07:26.860
Come with us.
We'll heal your wounds.

01:07:26.873 --> 01:07:28.298
<i>No, Ruth, no. Ixnay!</i>

01:07:28.308 --> 01:07:30.100
I'm afraid my wounds
can never be healed.

01:07:30.334 --> 01:07:31.702
You've things
to teach us.

01:07:31.712 --> 01:07:33.170
<i>Recipes to share.</i>

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.439
Thank you.

01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:39.177
We're over your Earth now.
It's time for you to go. Farewell.

01:07:39.187 --> 01:07:42.714
<i>I'm just dropping you at the
North Pole. Is that alright?</i>

01:07:43.016 --> 01:07:47.186
<i>Ex... call, okay?
I mean that.</i>

01:07:47.888 --> 01:07:51.558
<i>No, no. Go on, you kids.
I'll just be on the way. I'm fine.</i>

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.561
<i>You probably don't have
a spare room anyway,</i>

01:07:53.571 --> 01:07:55.096
<i>Do you?</i>

01:07:59.502 --> 01:08:02.438
<i>Yo, right back at ya!</i>

01:08:02.449 --> 01:08:05.342
<i>Go. Go, go, go.
Come on. Go.</i>

01:08:06.311 --> 01:08:08.980
<i>Oh, so that's what
a colon looks like!</i>

01:08:10.683 --> 01:08:13.152
<i>Captain's log: I've lost
my toupee and girdle...</i>

01:08:13.162 --> 01:08:14.987
<i>and I can't leave my room.</i>

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.126
<i>Y'know, I hope they land
right on Kenny Loggins.</i>

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:25.301
<i>Okay. Hands on ten and two;
check space cushion; pull out in the— aah!</i>

01:08:28.906 --> 01:08:32.009
<i>Oh great! Brack
siphoned our gas!</i>

01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:34.145
<i>Oh, Carl...</i>

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:35.149
<i>Cal.</i>

01:08:35.157 --> 01:08:37.183
<i>Oh, Cal...</i>

01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:40.685
- Home.
- Thank God it's still here...

01:08:40.697 --> 01:08:42.221
<i>...and friday!</i>

01:08:43.557 --> 01:08:46.560
<i>Hell, let's hangar
this baby in then.</i>

01:08:49.564 --> 01:08:51.265
<i>Spock!</i>

01:08:57.707 --> 01:09:00.076
<i>Let's see how many
times I can skip this thing!</i>

01:09:01.812 --> 01:09:05.149
<i>Nope. Pay no attention to me.
I'm just a weather balloon.</i>

01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:07.054
<i>Just some swamp gas.</i>

01:09:07.154 --> 01:09:10.390
<i>"Service engine soon."
I wonder what that's all about.</i>

01:09:10.492 --> 01:09:14.595
<i>A giant flaming hat was
seen over the coast tonight...</i>

01:09:15.096 --> 01:09:20.337
<i>Exeter thought he could squeeze
one more trip to earth out of this jalopy.</i>

01:09:22.205 --> 01:09:26.109
<i>I'll always love you, Br— Aah!</i>

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.212
<i>That's going to put your
panfish down for a while.</i>

01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:35.488
<i>Exeter died on impact. Brack was arraigned
in superior court, county of Los Angeles.</i>

01:09:35.497 --> 01:09:38.558
<i>In a moment,
the results of that trial.</i>

01:09:38.568 --> 01:09:41.094
<i>This Island Earth!</i>

01:09:41.696 --> 01:09:42.964
<i>That movie was a breeze!</i>

01:09:42.974 --> 01:09:45.566
<i>I dig those crazy
Metalunians, Mike.</i>

01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:48.337
The movie is over.

01:09:48.346 --> 01:09:50.604
The experiment is complete.

01:09:52.108 --> 01:09:54.577
And... if my calculations
are correct...

01:09:55.347 --> 01:09:56.382
Adjust for pi.

01:09:57.149 --> 01:10:01.053
Mike's will should be broken
just about now.

01:10:01.588 --> 01:10:03.623
Broken?

01:10:03.633 --> 01:10:08.796
- Hey Mike, your spirit feeling broken?
- Heck no. We're fine, Dr. Forrester.

01:10:09.364 --> 01:10:11.788
In fact, we're just hailing ourselves
a little Metaluna mix there.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.522
Just call me Ruth, Mike!

01:10:13.523 --> 01:10:17.004
Hey, check me out! I'm just like
one of your insects. Larger, of course.

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:21.578
Come on, everybody!
Make with the smoke, man!

01:10:22.613 --> 01:10:24.915
So, you're having a party, eh?

01:10:24.926 --> 01:10:28.220
Well, every party
needs a pooper!

01:10:42.637 --> 01:10:44.975
Hey, look at that. Dr. Forrester's gone.

01:10:45.126 --> 01:10:47.458
Alright. Now we'll
never get back to Earth!

01:10:51.784 --> 01:10:54.086
<i>Hey, wait a minute.</i>

01:10:58.058 --> 01:11:00.126
<i>I don't know why people
leave during the credits.</i>

01:11:00.137 --> 01:11:01.696
<i>- I always stay for the credits!
- Yeah, me too.</i>

01:11:02.263 --> 01:11:06.033
<i>This is Orson Welles.
A good cast deserves another mention.</i>

01:11:06.044 --> 01:11:10.872
<i>In the event that the first assistant director
is unable to fulfill her duties...</i>

01:11:10.883 --> 01:11:13.476
<i>Bix Skahill and his big band!</i>

01:11:14.644 --> 01:11:18.514
<i>Two Brantsegs in one film.
What are the odds?</i>

01:11:18.916 --> 01:11:22.252
<i>Puppet wranglers. There
weren't any puppets in this movie?</i>

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.156
<i>And Dale Mather as
the Beaver.</i>

01:11:25.925 --> 01:11:29.439
<i>- Oh, I love Triskos, with Espinosa.
- Oh, and a little Herget down 'em...</i>

01:11:31.098 --> 01:11:35.402
<i>- In the event that the first assistant camera
is unable to... - Okay, alright.</i>

01:11:35.415 --> 01:11:38.441
<i>Hey, they're on the blue line. They're over
the blue line. Oh, nice assist by Brad Keely!</i>

01:11:40.011 --> 01:11:44.949
<i>Come on down to L. Marie Ford.
Free hotdogs, and balloons for mom.</i>

01:11:47.486 --> 01:11:51.490
<i>¿Linda Froiland. Isn't she in</i>
Babes in Froiland?

01:11:51.924 --> 01:11:55.261
<i>- Andrea "Action Jackson" DuCane.
- That's good.</i>

01:11:56.397 --> 01:11:58.932
<i>Julie Walker, Texas Ranger.</i>

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.569
<i>- In the event that the assistant production
coordinator... - Okay, enough. - Sorry!</i>

01:12:03.772 --> 01:12:08.009
<i>The winner, and still phorographer,
Mickey Kienitz.</i>

01:12:08.477 --> 01:12:12.014
<i>So there's one guy who
just grinds out keys all day?</i>

01:12:12.582 --> 01:12:17.421
<i>- The Amazing Rando! - Watch Rando the Great
construct sets with his very mind!</i>

01:12:17.432 --> 01:12:20.258
<i>No, we've never met
before, have we?</i>

01:12:20.269 --> 01:12:23.328
<i>Craft services will be held at
10 am, Tuesday.</i>

01:12:23.338 --> 01:12:28.133
<i>- Kurt "Band-Aid" Gensmer.
- Dan "Contusion" Dustin.
- Jim "Heart Attack" Robinson.</i>

01:12:28.904 --> 01:12:34.877
<i>Oh, yeah. These are the guys that just sit in basement rooms
and figure out ways to make elves disappear.</i>

01:12:36.313 --> 01:12:39.249
<i>Avelino Deleon,
brother of Ponce.</i>

01:12:39.259 --> 01:12:43.754
<i>Here's Avelino in his rear-engined Lotus
followed by Jaquilin Zietlow in a Ferrari.</i>

01:12:44.723 --> 01:12:46.591
<i>We recorded at
Sync S-s-s-o-o-u-u-n-d.</i>

01:12:46.602 --> 01:12:52.566
