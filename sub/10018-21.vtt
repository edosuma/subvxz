00:06.864 --> 00:08.419
Previously on E.R.

00:08.420 --> 00:11.317
Loretta?
Loretta, I got you. I got you.

00:11.518 --> 00:14.475
You haven't by any chance
heard from your dad today, have you?

00:14.524 --> 00:17.226
I feel like I just plucked
the virtue of a virgin.

00:18.182 --> 00:19.710
I'm so glad you did.

00:19.711 --> 00:21.111
Stay off!

00:22.759 --> 00:24.238
Yeah, he fell right
over backwards onto it.

00:24.239 --> 00:25.717
He really didn't fall, did he?

00:25.718 --> 00:27.761
He put in a freaking incident
report against me!

00:27.762 --> 00:29.633
...but I think
you did a wonderful thing.

00:30.259 --> 00:32.039
You mean taking care of Susie?
I didn't have a choice.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.465
- You have children?
- No, I don't.

00:36.638 --> 00:38.158
"Take These Broken Wings"

00:38.187 --> 00:41.233
I didn't wanna give up fighting for her.
I'd go on forever.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.030
I mean, little Susie's almost a year old.

00:45.239 --> 00:48.746
She's been with me forever.

00:50.624 --> 00:53.670
Her birthday's next week.
Did I mention that?

00:53.837 --> 00:57.259
She fell in love
with our neighbors little puppy, JoBo.

00:57.426 --> 01:03.336
So I got her this stuffed little
animal, black and white, floppy ears.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.617
Did I tell you the daycare center called?

01:12.783 --> 01:16.457
Seems I still have an outstanding bill.

01:17.875 --> 01:22.633
Gotta love that whole
insult-to-injury thing.

01:25.220 --> 01:28.893
I kind of hate going up there, but...

01:33.317 --> 01:36.697
It's Susie's birthday next week.
Did I mention that?

01:37.239 --> 01:40.662
I've got to remember
to send her a present.

01:42.540 --> 01:45.837
Anyway, I suppose things are okay.

01:46.463 --> 01:50.553
Don't have to get up twice a night,
so at least I'm getting some more sleep.

01:51.846 --> 01:57.189
Just going to work, coming home,
sticking to a routine.

01:58.315 --> 02:01.028
I guess life's getting back to normal.

02:02.989 --> 02:05.327
Before the baby, that is.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.558
Ma'am?

02:40.383 --> 02:41.718
- Hello.
- Hi.

02:41.885 --> 02:44.181
I'm Father Ruiz-Anchia. Can I help you?

02:44.348 --> 02:49.147
Yeah. The lady that just sat down
there, she dropped this outside.

02:49.314 --> 02:51.526
Last week it was her keys.

02:51.692 --> 02:55.616
Once she even stepped out of her shoe.
Didn't even realize it.

02:55.783 --> 02:59.330
- Thank you. I'll give it to her.
- Okay.

03:01.583 --> 03:03.963
It's beautiful, isn't it?

03:04.630 --> 03:07.009
They're rehearsing
for a christening tomorrow.

03:07.301 --> 03:10.014
"Salve Mater Misericordia. "
It's based on the sequence...

03:10.181 --> 03:14.939
..."Salve Mater Salvatoris"
by Adam of Saint Victor.

03:15.106 --> 03:17.985
No one knows who did the translation.

03:22.450 --> 03:24.996
Is there anything else I can do for you?

03:27.083 --> 03:28.710
Hello.

03:29.337 --> 03:30.840
Can I help you?

03:33.552 --> 03:35.388
I don't know.

03:37.517 --> 03:39.270
I don't know.

04:36.361 --> 04:40.660
Turfed the chest pain to Cardiology,
the chronic puker to Medicine.

04:40.827 --> 04:44.166
I love these things. My daughter,
she left them after her last visit.

04:44.332 --> 04:47.546
Bipolar to Psych,
and say goodbye to Mr. Barry.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.841
The one who called you
an incompetent poser?

04:50.008 --> 04:52.345
That was before
his horrifying rectal revealed...

04:52.512 --> 04:54.307
...a horrifying case of hemorrhoids.

04:54.473 --> 04:57.228
Sent him to the surgery clinic.

04:57.395 --> 05:01.234
Carter's with that otitis media.
Ross isn't on yet. Lewis is late.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.991
She worked an extra four hours last
night. She's not due for another hour.

05:05.158 --> 05:07.369
- You want her to be late.
- Don't be ridiculous.

05:07.536 --> 05:11.501
"Her tardiness makes her a problematic
candidate for Chief Resident"?

05:11.668 --> 05:15.883
Mark, I can't believe you think I'd
keep tabs on anyone. You're late, Jerry.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.846
Time out. What do you see?

05:20.265 --> 05:23.186
Oh, come on. Al and I are engaged.

05:23.353 --> 05:25.565
- Oh, yeah, it's gorgeous.
- Congratulations.

05:25.732 --> 05:27.401
And the rest of the good news is...

05:27.569 --> 05:32.744
...paramedics are on their way in. Some
"failure to fly" suicide attempt. GCS-3.

05:33.036 --> 05:36.875
- If he's gorked, why bring him here?
- Landed in the lake, which is still chilly.

05:37.042 --> 05:40.715
- Warm him up, then pronounce him.
- Well, they can't be cold and dead.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.051
I thought we were gonna do
something fun.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.888
- I'm having fun.
- Yeah.

05:45.054 --> 05:47.767
Is this what you and Dad
used to do every morning?

05:48.143 --> 05:51.983
If it makes you feel any better, Dad
couldn't keep up if he were driving.

05:52.150 --> 05:54.153
You're the first woman I've jogged for.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.782
- Doug, I'm so flattered.
- Yeah.

05:56.949 --> 05:58.869
Remind me to reward you
when we go back.

05:59.036 --> 06:01.498
Let's go back. Come on.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.793
Wait. Hang on, I got you.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.923
- My knee, my knee, my knee.
- Okay, hang on. What, this one?

06:07.090 --> 06:10.095
- It goes out on me all the time.
- I'm a doctor, you know.

06:10.262 --> 06:13.768
- Yeah, a pediatrician.
- Yeah, you complaining?

06:13.934 --> 06:17.440
- Not necessarily.
- Here you go. Like this.

06:17.607 --> 06:19.444
Is this helping at all?

06:21.530 --> 06:24.285
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.538
I really am sorry.

06:27.415 --> 06:28.750
I'm not saying that she-

06:28.917 --> 06:32.423
The individual in question isn't
a possible candidate for chief resident.

06:32.590 --> 06:34.927
- Just not a probable candidate.
- Not saying that.

06:35.093 --> 06:37.848
30 years old. Traumatic full arrest,
been down 45 minutes.

06:38.015 --> 06:40.310
Jumped off a 75-foot crane,
right into the lake.

06:40.478 --> 06:44.692
On my count. One, two, three.
Last epi?

06:44.859 --> 06:47.739
- Four minutes.
- I'm only saying that this candidate...

06:47.906 --> 06:50.535
...has had some serious
personal difficulties of late.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.289
Which were handled quite well,
considering all things.

06:53.457 --> 06:56.294
- Gave two atropine in the field.
- Pupils fixed and dilated.

06:56.503 --> 06:59.007
I could consider supporting
this individual...

06:59.174 --> 07:01.177
...if there were
more supervision involved.

07:01.344 --> 07:04.057
- No BP. No pulse.
- By the new ER Attending...

07:04.224 --> 07:06.937
- ... Morgenstern wants to bring in?
- It's a possibility.

07:07.103 --> 07:10.776
- And the candidates for that job are?
- I think it's still pretty wide open.

07:10.984 --> 07:12.320
- It's warmed up.
- He's dead.

07:12.487 --> 07:15.950
So whoever I support for that position
will support my choice for chief?

07:16.118 --> 07:18.121
- It's possible.
- Mark, excuse me.

07:18.288 --> 07:21.960
Whenever you're done talking in code
about Dr. Lewis being Chief Resident...

07:22.127 --> 07:25.383
...and Dr. Weaver becoming Attending,
can we call the time of death?

07:25.549 --> 07:29.264
- Yeah, sure. Time of death: 8:53.
- Let me know when the family gets here.

07:29.431 --> 07:31.559
And call the Eye Bank.

07:33.145 --> 07:35.900
Girl, that's pretty.
Finally popped the question, huh?

07:36.067 --> 07:40.073
Yep. He really wanted me to have his
mother's ring, but she's still alive.

07:45.749 --> 07:48.127
- Oh, Susan. Hi.
- Hi. Where is everyone?

07:48.294 --> 07:51.801
Field trip to the park.
Spring at last, thank God.

07:51.968 --> 07:53.303
Well, I have a bill to pay.

07:53.470 --> 07:55.515
Well, listen.
Would you mind stopping back?

07:55.682 --> 07:58.102
They're holding the bus for me.

08:57.823 --> 09:00.661
Of course we get there,
and no one's there but an OB nurse.

09:00.828 --> 09:04.375
And Chloe is screaming for The Beatles,
"The White Album! "

09:04.542 --> 09:06.921
Carter's fumbling,
can't find it anywhere.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.218
Chloe doesn't want to breathe,
but she thinks singing will help.

09:10.385 --> 09:13.056
So there we are, like a bunch of crazies.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.614
And there I am,
in between verses, telling her:

09:23.781 --> 09:29.499
"Push, Chloe! Push! Come on.
You can do it, girl. You can do it! "

09:32.587 --> 09:35.216
And I cut the cord...

09:35.383 --> 09:39.765
...and wrapped the little,
warm baby all up...

09:40.600 --> 09:43.271
...and put it on her chest.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.820
Oh, this brand-new life.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.366
Chloe was crying.

09:50.533 --> 09:52.453
I was crying.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.207
She was so beautiful.

09:55.374 --> 09:57.460
Our baby girl.

09:58.337 --> 10:00.257
I told her:

10:00.424 --> 10:02.635
"You did it, Chloe.

10:03.137 --> 10:05.223
You really did it. "

10:07.143 --> 10:09.146
And you know what she said?

10:10.315 --> 10:12.819
She said, "No, we did it.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.658
We did it. "

10:20.205 --> 10:22.501
Our baby girl.

10:25.882 --> 10:28.135
I did send the check in.

10:28.302 --> 10:32.517
- I wouldn't say it were in the mail-
- Get off the phone. Clear Curtain Area 3.

10:32.809 --> 10:36.064
- Clear Curtain Area 3.
- You got it.

10:37.191 --> 10:40.947
Okay, come on. Don't play with that!
That's really expensive, Jimmy.

10:41.114 --> 10:44.036
- Give me back your gun.
- I was playing with that.

10:44.202 --> 10:46.289
Annie, Jimmy, I'll take you inside.

10:46.456 --> 10:50.796
- No, I want to stay with my mom.
- Take your brother and go with Lydia.

10:50.963 --> 10:53.509
- Gently, here we go.
- Dr. Greene, I don't feel well.

10:53.676 --> 10:56.263
We've got you, Loretta.
We've got you.

10:57.474 --> 10:59.185
Gently. Gently. We've got you.

11:01.939 --> 11:05.403
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
- No, you didn't. Not really.

11:05.570 --> 11:09.952
- We couldn't be out of penicillin, right?
- They moved the antibiotics down there.

11:14.585 --> 11:16.421
This is adorable.

11:16.588 --> 11:20.970
Yeah, I had to clear out some
of Susie's stuff from upstairs at daycare.

11:21.721 --> 11:25.226
Susan, if there's anything I can do,
if you want to talk about anything-

11:25.393 --> 11:27.481
You were right, here it is. Thanks.

11:43.423 --> 11:44.758
I'm with Pickman.

11:44.925 --> 11:48.138
- I know. Shep's off today.
- I'd be with Pickman even if he wasn't.

11:48.306 --> 11:50.643
You shouldn't have filed
that complaint with IAD.

11:50.809 --> 11:54.357
- He shouldn't have slammed that kid.
- It's not what happened.

11:54.523 --> 11:57.320
- You think he was just doing his job?
- Yes, I do.

11:57.487 --> 12:00.825
I believe the job doesn't have
to be done that way.

12:00.992 --> 12:03.747
- Who made you the voice of experience?
- Raul. That's who.

12:07.586 --> 12:09.507
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

12:09.673 --> 12:12.804
You know, Shep's been working
at this job for almost eight years.

12:12.970 --> 12:16.434
If you ever step off that high moral
ground, you might learn something.

12:16.601 --> 12:20.190
- Yeah, I already have.
- You should tell the IAD investigator.

12:20.691 --> 12:22.026
I already have.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.051
- Abdominal pain for how long?
- A couple of days.

12:37.218 --> 12:39.805
I feel so bloated. It doesn't go away.

12:39.971 --> 12:41.724
- Any vomiting?
- Yeah.

12:41.892 --> 12:45.064
Could I be-?
Could I be dehydrated again?

12:45.231 --> 12:47.859
We'll get some fluids in you
just in case.

12:48.026 --> 12:50.280
D-5. Half at 150 an hour.

12:50.447 --> 12:53.577
- CBC, lytes, chest and abdominal series.
- Coming up.

12:53.744 --> 12:56.916
I couldn't even get the kids to school.
They shouldn't be in here.

12:57.083 --> 13:00.255
Don't worry. Jerry's probably showing
them educational pictures...

13:00.421 --> 13:02.508
...of open-heart surgery
or something worse.

13:02.675 --> 13:05.262
- I'll check back when the tests are back.
- Okay.

13:12.148 --> 13:14.236
- Hey, there you are.
- Hi, how'd it go?

13:14.403 --> 13:16.364
Man, that guy was a real son of a bitch.

13:16.531 --> 13:18.700
It's an interview,
not a military inquest.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.872
Yeah, but he asked 1000 questions.
He already talked to Reilly.

13:22.039 --> 13:23.792
- I know.
- Little peckerhead.

13:23.960 --> 13:27.047
- He hasn't seen half what I've seen.
- Calm down, it'll be fine.

13:27.215 --> 13:30.595
You'll tell them you were there
the whole time? You saw everything?

13:30.762 --> 13:35.436
Yes, I was there. The guy stumbled
into the table. That simple.

13:36.354 --> 13:38.733
Anyone could see
it was kind of a tough situation.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.153
Shep, you're driving me crazy.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.825
I'm gonna speak
to this investigator guy...

13:43.991 --> 13:46.537
...and this whole thing's
gonna go away.

13:48.582 --> 13:51.462
Will you please go away?

13:51.629 --> 13:54.843
It's my day off. I don't really
have anything else to do.

13:55.009 --> 13:59.767
Well, it's spring, you know?
Plant flowers. Drive some golf balls.

13:59.934 --> 14:02.814
- I don't play golf.
- Start.

14:02.981 --> 14:05.568
Annie, will you stop? Just-

14:05.734 --> 14:08.656
- You want me to call the cops?
- Don't laugh. Al's on the way.

14:08.823 --> 14:10.242
By the way. Congratulations.

14:10.409 --> 14:13.956
We just got into town, practicing for
a basketball tournament on Saturday.

14:14.124 --> 14:17.504
I talked to her mom, said she was
operated on when she was 8 weeks old.

14:17.671 --> 14:20.884
- Something called a Kasai procedure.
- Carter.

14:21.051 --> 14:25.767
Hepatoportoenterostomy. Done for
liver failure from bile duct obstruction.

14:27.687 --> 14:29.481
Okay, up and in.

14:29.648 --> 14:32.069
I can do it myself, thank you.

14:32.236 --> 14:36.075
TC's dedicated. I finally knew something
was wrong when she didn't wanna play.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.870
I need to be fixed now, okay?

14:38.036 --> 14:41.166
Because I have a tournament on
Saturday, and it's very important.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.421
My son's in a Pee Wee tournament
next week.

14:43.588 --> 14:47.427
- Pee Wee stops at 8. I'm 10.
- Sit up.

14:47.593 --> 14:51.016
- Fever's 101.
- How long has she been jaundiced?

14:51.182 --> 14:53.478
We've got a lot of kids.
I didn't really notice.

14:53.645 --> 14:55.648
Dr. Ross, can I speak to you
for a minute?

14:55.815 --> 14:57.651
Yeah.

14:59.613 --> 15:01.616
Her folks live in Penrose.

15:01.783 --> 15:03.619
Penrose? Like 150 miles from here?

15:03.786 --> 15:05.956
- Yeah, soybean country.
- Yeah.

15:06.124 --> 15:09.504
They're on their way, but I've got
all these other kids at the motel...

15:09.671 --> 15:11.674
...and God knows
what damage they're doing.

15:11.841 --> 15:13.886
I imagine TC's gonna have
to be admitted.

15:14.052 --> 15:16.056
In the meantime,
we'll keep an eye on her.

15:16.223 --> 15:17.809
All right. Thanks.

15:19.812 --> 15:21.982
Come with me. You're gonna be okay.

15:22.149 --> 15:27.491
Cats! Burmese, Cornish Rex,
Japanese Bobtail.

15:27.658 --> 15:30.162
God, my hatred for them
knows no bounds.

15:30.329 --> 15:33.710
- Short hair, long hair, I hate them.
- I think you're allergic to them.

15:33.877 --> 15:37.632
I never used to be. My brother had
a cat growing up, and I hated...

15:37.799 --> 15:40.345
Sometimes your allergies get worse
when you get older.

15:40.512 --> 15:42.098
Or maybe that's completely false.

15:42.265 --> 15:46.146
I'm shooting the Chicago Cat Show, and
suddenly I'm Tippi Hedren in The Birds.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.815
They're everywhere!

15:47.982 --> 15:50.236
Iris. Iris. Iris, stop.

15:50.403 --> 15:52.531
Okay, we're just gonna get you
your own room.

15:52.698 --> 15:55.953
Russian Blue, Himalaya,
Egyptian Mau, Bengal, Balinese...

15:56.120 --> 15:59.960
...Burmese, Cornish Rex,
Japanese Bobtail...

16:03.716 --> 16:05.552
Please, somebody help me.
It's my baby.

16:05.719 --> 16:07.848
- Clear Trauma 1.
- What happened?

16:08.015 --> 16:10.769
She was in her crib. She doesn't cry.
I can't wake her up.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.398
- How old is she?
- Six months. Her name's Grace.

16:13.565 --> 16:16.195
She's not breathing and she's cyanotic.

16:17.237 --> 16:20.242
- What is wrong with her?
- Pediatric intubation tray.

16:20.409 --> 16:22.622
-4.0 ET tube.
- Heart rate's only 40.

16:22.788 --> 16:27.087
- Has she been sick, Mrs...?
- Ramsey. Judith Ramsey.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.549
A little vomiting.
Just getting over the flu.

16:29.716 --> 16:31.970
- Any fever or seizures?
- Temp's normal.

16:32.137 --> 16:34.432
She was jerking.
I couldn't get her to stop.

16:34.599 --> 16:38.898
- I need a 3.5, not a 4.0.
- Use a 4.0. Susan, I'll do it.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.193
Please, just tell me
what is wrong with her.

16:41.359 --> 16:43.989
You have to wait outside
so we can take care of Grace.

16:44.198 --> 16:47.119
- I don't wanna leave.
- Susan, take her to the Waiting Room.

16:47.286 --> 16:49.957
- No. Please.
- Susan, now!

16:50.124 --> 16:54.297
20 cc's per kilogram bolus
normal saline, CBC, Chem-7...

16:54.464 --> 16:59.222
...heel-stick glucose. Get a head CT,
and we may need an LP.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.694
Come on.

17:28.519 --> 17:30.773
Let me see. Let me see.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.991
- Think she'll be able to play?
- I doubt it.

17:37.158 --> 17:40.497
Let me know when the LFTs,
BUN and creatinine are back.

17:40.664 --> 17:43.042
And, Carter, she's in here alone,
so stay close.

17:43.210 --> 17:44.711
Okay.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.569
Yuck.

18:02.950 --> 18:05.411
What are you kids doing in the hall?

18:35.293 --> 18:38.549
Why is it that Chloe always
called Mom "Cookie"...

18:38.715 --> 18:41.637
...and I always called Mom "Mom"?

18:42.721 --> 18:45.726
She was such a great kid that way.
Funny and fearless.

18:45.893 --> 18:49.692
Just one big party
all wrapped up and...

18:52.989 --> 18:57.161
We'd dress up and put on these plays
at the top of the stairs.

18:57.328 --> 19:00.834
Chloe, of course, went straight
for Mom's best dresses, best jewelry...

19:01.001 --> 19:02.336
...best shoes.

19:02.503 --> 19:06.635
I was afraid they'd get mad, so I was
the one in the bathrobe and sneakers.

19:06.802 --> 19:10.057
But they never did. Never. Not once.

19:10.224 --> 19:13.981
Chloe went for the good stuff,
and I went for being the good girl.

19:14.147 --> 19:16.859
She was such an accomplished adult
by the time she was 9.

19:17.026 --> 19:19.698
And so lousy at it
by the time she was 19.

19:19.864 --> 19:23.705
I mean, if she could just go back
to some of that...

19:23.871 --> 19:27.043
...then if she wanted to be a mother...

19:30.716 --> 19:33.887
What am I saying? She is a mother.

19:41.567 --> 19:44.864
Boy, when you buy somebody lunch,
you go all out.

19:45.030 --> 19:49.580
How's your knee? If it's still bothering
you, I can get you something for that.

19:49.746 --> 19:51.791
- I heard from Ray.
- Oh, yeah.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.213
Well, not from him actually.
About him.

19:55.380 --> 19:59.554
- How's the good life in the Caymans?
- He never went there.

19:59.721 --> 20:02.809
He's in Mexico.
Kind of sends a message, doesn't it?

20:02.976 --> 20:05.939
Like what? Like he's not coming back?

20:06.106 --> 20:08.109
Well, what does it look like to you?

20:09.528 --> 20:13.367
Well, I'm used to him disappearing. He
doesn't tend to mention it in advance.

20:13.534 --> 20:16.581
Yeah, I guess not, considering
he took my money with him.

20:20.546 --> 20:22.591
Well...

20:22.757 --> 20:25.011
- Thanks for all the sympathy.
- No...

20:25.177 --> 20:29.101
...I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm disappointed.

20:29.268 --> 20:32.481
Well, don't be. It wasn't your money.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.403
He bolted on me year after year.

20:35.570 --> 20:37.990
But I just didn't think
with you in the picture...

20:38.157 --> 20:42.873
- What's that got to do with it?
- I'd think he would want to see you.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.335
Come back and see me.

20:48.966 --> 20:50.886
Come back, see us.
Is that what you mean?

20:51.052 --> 20:52.638
He doesn't know about us, Karen.

20:52.848 --> 20:55.768
Well, maybe it's your idea of fun,
to watch him find out.

20:55.935 --> 20:58.940
Is that what this is about, Doug?
What we're about?

20:59.107 --> 21:01.320
Getting back at Dad,
stealing his girlfriend?

21:01.528 --> 21:02.906
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

21:03.072 --> 21:06.328
For three weeks, you've been telling me
how you can't stand the guy.

21:06.494 --> 21:10.208
Now you're disappointed he's not
coming back? That is ridiculous.

21:14.215 --> 21:15.551
My motto is: "Think Jordan. "

21:15.718 --> 21:18.221
I'm just saying that you can't
rule out Orlando.

21:18.388 --> 21:20.851
What do they know about basketball
in Florida?

21:21.018 --> 21:23.814
- Does this hurt?
- Yeah, a little.

21:25.317 --> 21:29.990
TC's right. Orlando's got a good record.
Push comes to shove, they'll choke.

21:30.158 --> 21:33.413
Only one NBA leader in scoring
and zip in rebounds.

21:33.580 --> 21:36.417
Okay, I give up.

21:43.971 --> 21:45.932
- Carter.
- Liver's enlarged...

21:46.099 --> 21:47.477
...and firm upon examination.

21:47.644 --> 21:50.982
Lab tests show elevated LFTs,
leukocytosis, and a prolonged PT...

21:51.150 --> 21:53.195
...consistent with ascending cholangitis.

21:53.445 --> 21:57.159
Start her on one gram
of cefotaxime IV Q-6.

21:57.326 --> 21:59.747
- She on the list for a liver transplant?
- Status 3.

21:59.914 --> 22:03.795
Move her up to Status 2. She'll have
to stay hospitalized until we find a liver.

22:03.961 --> 22:06.132
I better brush up
on my basketball trivia.

22:06.299 --> 22:08.552
You should do that anyway.

22:11.098 --> 22:14.229
- Dr. Benton? Al Boulet.
- How are you doing?

22:14.395 --> 22:16.398
I got some kind of flu or something.

22:16.565 --> 22:19.820
Yeah? Well, take care.

22:23.535 --> 22:25.497
Sorry about those kids and the camera.

22:25.663 --> 22:28.919
I'm glad I got it back. I'm sorry
about snorting all over your hand.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.130
That's just another adventure.

22:31.297 --> 22:35.262
Speaking of which,
I was thinking maybe...

22:35.429 --> 22:37.557
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

22:38.267 --> 22:40.103
- Who are you?
- Lily.

22:40.437 --> 22:43.776
- Where do you come from?
- The bus stop.

22:45.612 --> 22:47.406
What's wrong?

22:47.573 --> 22:50.495
- I can't get him off.
- Is that a hermit crab?

22:50.662 --> 22:52.539
Herman. My dad named him.

22:52.707 --> 22:54.877
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to cut him off.

22:55.044 --> 22:57.757
But he'd die, right?
I can't kill Herman.

22:57.924 --> 23:01.388
No, of course you can't.
Cats you can kill. But not Herman.

23:01.554 --> 23:06.813
It's just water, honey. There you go.

23:06.979 --> 23:10.235
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:12.405 --> 23:17.163
I produced this cheesy Jacques Cousteau
rip-off thing a couple of months ago.

23:18.999 --> 23:22.630
- Anything on Grace Ramsey?
- She's breathing spontaneously.

23:22.797 --> 23:25.176
- We' re waiting on the CT.
- Okay, let me know.

23:25.343 --> 23:29.182
- They're seriously backed up up there.
- Just let me know.

23:33.314 --> 23:36.486
- Hi. I'm Dr. Weaver.
- Hi.

23:36.653 --> 23:38.948
- Your name's Al Boulet?
- Yeah.

23:39.115 --> 23:42.745
We've got a Jeanie Boulet here.
Any relation?

23:42.913 --> 23:47.086
She's my wife.
Actually, we're separated.

23:47.378 --> 23:51.802
You've been losing weight,
having fevers, sweating?

23:51.969 --> 23:56.560
Yeah, I think I've got the 24-day flu
instead of the 24-hour.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.148
A lot of stuff's
been going around at work.

24:01.317 --> 24:03.237
Deep breath.

24:04.072 --> 24:06.909
Your shortness of breath,
how long's that been going on?

24:07.076 --> 24:09.831
About a month or so.

24:09.997 --> 24:12.042
Mr. Boulet, I'm gonna get
a chest x-ray...

24:12.252 --> 24:15.799
...and I'll talk to you about
some blood tests I'd like to order.

24:18.929 --> 24:21.307
- Seen Dr. Greene?
- He snuck out for some lunch.

24:21.474 --> 24:24.813
Radiology screwed up the films on
Loretta Sweet. We have to redo them.

24:24.980 --> 24:28.277
- What happened? Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

24:28.444 --> 24:31.741
Teach this SOB to grapple with
a soon-to-be-married man.

24:31.908 --> 24:34.203
Let's pour a little cold peroxide
on those cuts.

24:34.370 --> 24:37.458
- You don't look so good.
- Don't worry. Nothing will to ruin...

24:37.625 --> 24:40.797
- ... our celebration at the Ritz-Carlton.
- Let's clean you up.

25:14.310 --> 25:16.271
Hey, Jeanie.

25:16.771 --> 25:20.319
- I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah. I'm just getting a little checkup.

25:20.486 --> 25:23.365
- What's wrong?
- Nothing really.

25:24.868 --> 25:28.958
Just a little tired lately.
Breath feels kind of short or something.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.671
- Working too much, that's all.
- Did they say anything?

25:31.838 --> 25:36.387
No. They just took a bunch of blood,
did some x-rays.

25:37.388 --> 25:42.939
- Look, I've got some other patients.
- Don't worry about it. Go do your thing.

25:43.106 --> 25:47.112
- They've got me in good hands.
- I'll try and stop by later.

25:59.966 --> 26:01.927
Hi, this is Jeanie down in the ER.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.599
We've been waiting
on some lab tests forever.

26:04.765 --> 26:09.064
Boulet. Al Boulet. Yeah.

26:09.231 --> 26:12.737
If you could put a rush on them,
I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

26:17.786 --> 26:20.040
- Carol Hathaway?
- Yes.

26:20.207 --> 26:22.461
Sorry to keep you waiting.

26:23.128 --> 26:25.090
I'm David Haskell from IAD.

26:25.257 --> 26:28.262
- That's Investigations and-
- Audit Division, yes, I know.

26:29.305 --> 26:32.727
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- You said that.

26:32.894 --> 26:34.773
Must have really meant it then.

26:36.149 --> 26:38.195
So you saw Ahn stumble.

26:38.361 --> 26:40.239
- Who?
- Ahn Nguyen. Vietnamese boy.

26:40.406 --> 26:43.411
- Saw him hit his head on a coffee table?
- That's right.

26:43.578 --> 26:45.372
- Just lost his balance?
- Must have.

26:45.539 --> 26:48.836
Which would make sense,
after Mr. Shepard gave him-

26:49.003 --> 26:51.090
What did he call it?

26:51.257 --> 26:55.722
"A light shove. " Is that how
you'd describe it? Light shove?

26:55.890 --> 27:00.480
Well, the kid wasn't falling very fast.
So, yeah, it was probably pretty light.

27:00.648 --> 27:03.693
Mr. Brown says you
helped him unstrap a board.

27:03.861 --> 27:06.406
He was nervous and frustrated,
so I helped him do it.

27:06.573 --> 27:08.994
Then you both took the board
back into the kitchen.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.580
No, Reilly took it.

27:10.747 --> 27:14.377
That's right. He says he was headed
to the kitchen with the board.

27:14.544 --> 27:17.549
That's when he saw Mr. Shepard-

27:17.716 --> 27:20.721
"Slam" is the word he used.

27:20.888 --> 27:24.227
Slam Ahn Nguyen across the room.

27:24.393 --> 27:28.651
So you must have gone back into the
kitchen at pretty much the same time.

27:29.109 --> 27:32.531
No, Reilly moved in first.
He carried the board ahead of me.

27:32.698 --> 27:36.830
But if you both saw the incident,
which obviously you did...

27:36.997 --> 27:42.965
...since you think it was a light shove,
and Mr. Brown thinks it was a slam...

27:43.132 --> 27:46.971
...then both of you had to be there
the whole time.

27:48.974 --> 27:50.853
Yes, that's right.

27:51.979 --> 27:54.692
I was there the whole time.

27:59.533 --> 28:02.205
No, we had a fight,
and I feel like a jerk.

28:02.372 --> 28:07.088
My dad did take her money,
and I wasn't all that sympathetic.

28:07.254 --> 28:10.092
She was accusing me
of wanting him to come back.

28:10.258 --> 28:12.680
- What is this all about?
- I don't know.

28:12.846 --> 28:16.310
- What kind of question is that?
- It's not your fault he stole her money.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.982
- Except that he gave the money to me.
- So give it back.

28:20.150 --> 28:25.242
I can't. I only have $10,000. I gave
15,000 for that kid's chemotherapy.

28:25.867 --> 28:28.163
This is way too complicated for me.

28:35.675 --> 28:38.137
Kerry, the CT's are back.

28:39.347 --> 28:41.309
Subdural hematoma, loud and clear.

28:41.476 --> 28:44.731
You found retinal hemorrhages
and didn't bother to tell me.

28:44.898 --> 28:47.527
You were already upset
about the intubation.

28:47.695 --> 28:50.323
This mother's abusing her child.
I want to talk to her.

28:50.490 --> 28:51.826
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

28:51.992 --> 28:54.163
A subdural hematoma
and retinal hemorrhages...

28:54.330 --> 28:57.961
...are the hallmarks of Shaken Baby
Syndrome. She could have brain damage!

28:58.128 --> 29:01.591
- I've ordered a Neurosurgical consult.
- I wanna talk to the mother.

29:01.758 --> 29:04.596
- She's the problem!
- I called Children and Family Services.

29:04.763 --> 29:06.558
They have 1000 cases.
Who keeps tabs?

29:06.724 --> 29:10.648
I've also notified the police.
It's the best we can do.

29:10.815 --> 29:14.362
You know that if this mother doesn't
get it and that baby starts crying...

29:14.529 --> 29:16.825
...she picks her up
and the baby doesn't stop...

29:16.992 --> 29:19.787
...she's just going to start
shaking her and shaking her!

29:19.954 --> 29:24.294
We can't solve this, Susan. I wish
we could, but we both know we can't.

29:24.461 --> 29:27.091
So we're gonna
take care of the child, okay?

29:27.258 --> 29:31.473
We're gonna do
everything we can for the child.

29:34.185 --> 29:37.691
They took the baby
up to Pediatrics ICU.

29:37.859 --> 29:41.281
Children and Family Services
came down to talk to the mother.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.701
The police are looking into it.

29:43.867 --> 29:46.330
And that's the last I know.

29:46.497 --> 29:48.625
That's the last I'm gonna know.

29:49.669 --> 29:52.757
Sometimes that's the good thing
about being an ER doc.

29:52.924 --> 29:56.179
Treat them and street them.
Turf them upstairs.

29:58.182 --> 30:01.312
I've gotta hand it
to that Kerry Weaver, though.

30:01.479 --> 30:03.441
She surprises you.

30:03.607 --> 30:06.821
Just when you think
she's completely clueless...

30:06.989 --> 30:08.700
...she hangs in there.

30:08.867 --> 30:12.998
Stalling, arguing with me,
agreeing with me-

30:14.625 --> 30:18.465
"We can't solve the problem.
We can take care of the child. "

30:21.219 --> 30:23.974
Until I finally let go.

30:35.242 --> 30:37.537
Getting bored sitting in your room?

30:38.956 --> 30:42.713
Hey, your fever's down.
Come on, bounce me one.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.722
The good news is that
once you get a new liver...

30:48.889 --> 30:51.018
...the disease won't come back.

30:52.185 --> 30:56.234
And you're official now. You're
all signed up on the transplant list.

31:00.742 --> 31:02.536
We don't need it right away.

31:02.703 --> 31:05.624
If it takes a few months,
you're still gonna be fine.

31:07.586 --> 31:09.756
Unfortunately,
you're gonna have to stay here.

31:09.922 --> 31:13.303
Well, not here. You're gonna be upstairs.

31:13.471 --> 31:16.099
But I'll come visit you, whenever I can.

31:16.266 --> 31:21.357
And you can educate me
on the finer points of the point guard.

31:23.987 --> 31:26.240
Maybe we can watch
the playoffs together.

31:26.408 --> 31:28.661
That sounds pretty cool, doesn't it?

31:28.828 --> 31:31.625
But I can't play
in my tournament, can I?

31:31.875 --> 31:33.461
No.

31:33.961 --> 31:36.549
No, I'm sorry, TC.
You can't play in your tournament.

31:54.161 --> 31:56.164
Thought I'd never get out of there.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.833
I'm glad you didn't wait.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.505
Tuna on whole wheat with lettuce and
tomato. You want it? I'm not hungry.

32:01.672 --> 32:04.093
Right after I finish my cheese steak.

32:04.260 --> 32:08.183
I know I've said this before, but you
have to get Kerry Weaver off my back.

32:08.350 --> 32:10.395
- What?
- Six-month-old baby girl came in...

32:10.562 --> 32:13.066
...cyanotic. Kerry thinks
I can't do the intubation.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.777
- But you did?
- No! She took over.

32:14.943 --> 32:16.781
Yes, it was a baby. Yes, it was hard.

32:16.947 --> 32:19.576
But I've done this 100 times.

32:20.036 --> 32:21.830
How's everything else?

32:21.997 --> 32:24.584
You mean therapy?
That is what you mean, right?

32:24.752 --> 32:28.174
Well, do I feel terrific? Not really.

32:28.341 --> 32:31.471
Am I marginally better? Not really.

32:31.638 --> 32:35.393
Am I happy I'm spending my money on
therapy and not Gymboree or a stroller?

32:35.560 --> 32:37.981
Not really.

32:38.982 --> 32:40.652
So everything's going okay.

32:47.497 --> 32:50.417
- Want to walk back?
- They didn't page me.

32:52.588 --> 32:56.344
I wish there was something I could do.
Something I could say.

32:57.179 --> 32:58.932
So do I.

33:01.977 --> 33:06.109
It would be so much easier if this bad
news were happening to some patient.

33:07.529 --> 33:12.036
I shouldn't be drinking this. I'll never
get to sleep. I never sleep anyway.

33:12.828 --> 33:16.042
Yeah. You know, we actually
had a class in medical school.

33:16.209 --> 33:19.631
A sort of "How to deliver the bad news. "

33:20.091 --> 33:24.472
We even had to
make videotapes and perform it.

33:24.848 --> 33:28.145
"I'm very sorry, sir, but
your wife was hit by a Mack truck...

33:28.312 --> 33:31.818
...and we did everything possible,
but she died. "

33:33.445 --> 33:36.408
Then some actor
playing the husband...

33:36.675 --> 33:42.652
...would go into convulsions on the floor
and start crying out in agony.

33:42.919 --> 33:45.673
That's not usually how they react.

33:46.716 --> 33:49.805
They shake. Then they start to cry.

33:50.555 --> 33:53.477
Yeah. I remember the first time
I had to do it.

33:53.937 --> 33:56.941
It was this elderly man.
And his wife had just died.

33:57.109 --> 33:59.946
No big accident, just old age.

34:00.113 --> 34:04.495
And he looked at me for about a minute.

34:04.662 --> 34:06.623
And then walked away.

34:08.083 --> 34:10.964
Yeah. I was the one left shaking.

34:13.802 --> 34:16.347
Practice makes perfect, though.

34:16.514 --> 34:19.643
Now I can deliver that speech
in a heartbeat.

34:19.812 --> 34:22.690
And it's not that I don't feel badly,
because I do.

34:22.857 --> 34:25.279
But I get the words out, and I move on.

34:25.445 --> 34:28.158
The healers are always taught
to move on.

34:30.870 --> 34:34.585
And for the life of me,
I can't seem to do that now.

34:37.339 --> 34:43.014
This hurt is so strong and so present,
it makes me feel her.

34:44.518 --> 34:47.188
And to still be able to feel her...

34:51.862 --> 34:54.117
I don't want to move on from that.

35:15.776 --> 35:18.573
- You need something?
- Your interview must have gone well.

35:19.031 --> 35:20.367
Got a lot of work, Reilly.

35:20.784 --> 35:23.414
Haskell called.
They dropped the investigation.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.627
It seems your answers
confirmed Shep's side of the story.

35:26.794 --> 35:29.883
Well, now we can all get back to work.

35:32.553 --> 35:34.682
I like you.
But whatever you said in there...

35:34.849 --> 35:37.185
...I don't think you're doing Shep
any favors.

35:37.352 --> 35:40.107
Maybe it's the Raul thing
and he'll come through this...

35:40.274 --> 35:44.698
...but right now, he doesn't
belong out there. He's dangerous.

35:55.507 --> 35:57.719
I can't keep doing this.

35:57.886 --> 36:01.976
You can. You made it through the last
surgery, you can make it through this.

36:02.518 --> 36:04.855
It's the kids.

36:05.022 --> 36:08.445
They never know what's
going on from one day to the next.

36:08.612 --> 36:10.948
Where I'm gonna be,
where they're gonna be.

36:11.365 --> 36:13.661
They're gonna be
at my house tonight, okay?

36:13.828 --> 36:16.458
My parental skills
can use a little brushing up.

36:16.624 --> 36:19.170
I don't know what to tell them.

36:19.337 --> 36:21.340
I don't know what to say.

36:22.508 --> 36:25.597
I've hardly even seen them all day.

36:26.599 --> 36:30.438
Well, I can tell you one thing.
They've been pretty busy.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.357
Take a look.

36:35.613 --> 36:39.035
Look, Mom, they turned us into doctors.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.956
Officer, I'm so sorry.

36:42.123 --> 36:45.378
Are you kidding? He was the center
of attention. He loved it.

36:47.382 --> 36:49.260
Are you sure you can't stay for dinner?

36:49.427 --> 36:54.894
Mom, look. Thank you, but I can't
eat dinner at 5:30 in the afternoon.

36:55.061 --> 36:58.399
Pathetic, isn't it? How Howard
comes back from the office...

36:58.566 --> 37:02.239
...grabs dinner,
rushes back to the office.

37:02.406 --> 37:05.244
I thought tax season was over.
What happened to April 15th?

37:05.411 --> 37:07.623
Does the word "extension"
mean anything to you?

37:07.789 --> 37:10.211
As a matter of fact,
I think I have one of those.

37:11.003 --> 37:14.634
- All right. Listen, Mom...
- So how much do you need?

37:14.801 --> 37:19.266
You can't possibly know that.
I haven't said anything about money.

37:19.433 --> 37:22.730
- You're not here for dinner, are you?
- No.

37:22.898 --> 37:26.195
- You don't drop by a lot to play bridge.
- I don't play bridge.

37:26.362 --> 37:29.992
My point exactly. Doug, there are
three reasons kids come back home.

37:30.159 --> 37:33.748
One, to announce
they're getting married.

37:34.333 --> 37:39.633
Two, they're depressed and they need
a place to sleep for three years.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.346
And three, they need money.

37:43.973 --> 37:45.976
My money's on the money.

37:48.898 --> 37:51.944
So were you always so smart?

37:52.111 --> 37:55.450
Right up until the day
I married your father.

37:57.578 --> 37:59.206
Doug.

37:59.831 --> 38:03.463
All those years you were growing up,
not knowing about your dad...

38:04.464 --> 38:06.592
...I couldn't help you then.

38:06.843 --> 38:09.973
Nothing would make me happier
than to help you now.

38:12.352 --> 38:14.605
Don't you wanna know
what I need the money for?

38:14.773 --> 38:16.859
You really wanna tell me?

38:20.281 --> 38:23.578
- Bring the carrots over here.
- Okay.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.518
- Broken tib-fib.
- Jeanie, do you have a minute?

38:37.685 --> 38:40.856
If I call Ortho now,
they ought to make it down by summer.

38:42.943 --> 38:46.240
- It's about Al, isn't it?
- Yeah.

38:46.407 --> 38:50.371
- And is it AIDS?
- Yeah. Pneumocystis pneumonia.

38:52.124 --> 38:55.797
I saw his chart, and when he told me
how he was feeling, his symptoms...

38:57.132 --> 39:00.346
I need to give him the news.
I thought it might be easier for him-

39:00.513 --> 39:02.432
No, I'll do it. I'll do it.

39:08.108 --> 39:10.362
I know you're separated.

39:12.031 --> 39:16.246
But he may have been
HIV-positive for a few years.

39:16.414 --> 39:18.458
Have you ever been tested?

39:19.794 --> 39:21.463
How many married people get tested?

39:34.734 --> 39:37.238
I checked for you at the hotel suite.

39:38.657 --> 39:40.410
It doesn't seem to be mine anymore.

39:41.328 --> 39:44.166
Something about
when you lose company money.

39:44.333 --> 39:47.171
You're gonna have to let me
write you something for that.

39:47.338 --> 39:49.049
Whatever.

39:50.927 --> 39:53.849
I've gotta say,
I much prefer your place.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.521
Whatever.

40:05.868 --> 40:09.290
Some of what you said,
I don't know if it's true or not.

40:09.456 --> 40:13.088
But you made me think about it.
And I...

40:13.255 --> 40:15.842
I don't know. I realized that...

40:19.557 --> 40:21.476
...I want to be with you, Karen.

40:22.102 --> 40:24.732
You don't see me
kicking you out the door.

40:27.820 --> 40:29.656
You're gonna have to let me do this...

40:29.823 --> 40:32.703
...because I have a very low threshold
for your pain.

40:36.375 --> 40:39.338
Up, and there you go.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.937
- Karen.
- Doug?

40:49.104 --> 40:52.192
- I have a confession to make.
- You're not married, are you?

40:52.359 --> 40:56.574
- No, it's worse than that.
- Okay.

40:59.287 --> 41:03.294
You know the money that my father
took from you? He gave it to me.

41:05.297 --> 41:08.009
- What?
- Yeah, I-

41:08.177 --> 41:11.432
I mean, he never gave me a dime
when I was in medical school...

41:11.640 --> 41:16.440
...and he just handed me a bunch
of cash before he took off.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.324
Twenty-five thousand dollars.

41:22.490 --> 41:25.329
Yeah. I want you to have it.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.005
Twenty-five thousand dollars?

41:43.483 --> 41:45.862
Ray stole over 250 grand.

41:49.534 --> 41:52.789
- Two hundred and fifty grand?
- You got it.

41:58.424 --> 42:00.260
This is nothing.

42:01.261 --> 42:03.807
- This is a drop in the bucket.
- No, it's everything.

42:04.725 --> 42:07.146
It's the sweetest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

42:07.313 --> 42:10.485
I could get fired tomorrow,
but I gotta love you for this one.

42:23.506 --> 42:26.844
Great news, huh, baby?
They dropped the whole thing!

42:27.011 --> 42:29.224
Whatever you said in there
made the difference.

42:29.390 --> 42:31.602
We are home free.

42:31.769 --> 42:34.231
Let's celebrate. Let's go do something.

42:34.398 --> 42:37.779
- Shep, I got a lot of paperwork.
- You can do this later. This can wait.

42:37.945 --> 42:41.618
No, I really need to do this now.

42:41.785 --> 42:44.581
Okay, we go to dinner, then.
Dinner, maybe a club.

42:44.748 --> 42:48.797
No. They're playing basketball outside.

42:48.963 --> 42:51.133
I'll join you when I'm finished.

42:51.300 --> 42:52.886
Okay.

42:53.386 --> 42:55.140
Don't be too long.

43:20.555 --> 43:22.810
Al, I need to talk to you.

43:27.943 --> 43:30.363
It's cold in here tonight.

43:32.700 --> 43:35.538
Maybe Chloe is getting it together.

43:36.206 --> 43:38.919
Or maybe Joe can keep it together.

43:40.254 --> 43:42.883
Sometimes I dream
that they call and say:

43:43.050 --> 43:46.347
"Hey, Suze, why don't you
take her again for a while? "

43:46.514 --> 43:50.979
And in my dream I say,
"Yes, Chloe. I will take her forever. "

43:53.526 --> 43:55.529
Then I wake up,
and I know it's not true...

43:55.695 --> 43:58.742
...because my arms hurt
from feeling so empty.

44:02.748 --> 44:05.461
I always knew you loved your children.

44:06.463 --> 44:10.427
I just never realized
how much you fell in love with them.

44:12.013 --> 44:14.977
Little Susie was like a storybook.

44:15.769 --> 44:18.607
One you never wanted to put down.

44:21.320 --> 44:26.745
Every smile was some new page
to be pored over.

44:26.912 --> 44:29.082
Studied. Touched.

44:31.628 --> 44:33.423
Remembered.

45:04.097 --> 45:06.685
I loved my storybook.

45:07.519 --> 45:10.607
For the first time in a long time...

45:12.026 --> 45:14.280
...I didn't feel alone.
