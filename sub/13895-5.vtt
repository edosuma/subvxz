13:17.000 --> 13:18.590
[MALACHY] WE BLEW OUR
COVER WITH THIS GUY.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.000
YOU JUST NEED TO GET
SOME FOOTAGE

13:20.050 --> 13:21.760

13:21.800 --> 13:25.590
[ROSE] AND JAKE AND
MALACHY WILL BE CLOSE BY

13:53.040 --> 13:54.910
OR HUG, OR HOLD HANDS,

13:54.960 --> 13:57.330
[JAKE] YOU'RE NOT GETTING A
LITTLE BIT OF CHEMISTRY BETWEEN

13:57.370 --> 13:59.080

15:28.920 --> 15:31.140

17:48.150 --> 17:48.730
[DR. COLLINS] YEAH.

17:48.770 --> 17:50.110
[JAKE] IT WASN'T, I SWEAR.

17:50.150 --> 17:53.690

18:15.300 --> 18:17.510
[JAKE] NO, NO, NO.
WE'RE NOT 100 PERCENT SURE YET.

18:17.550 --> 18:19.010
[TERRI] WHO IS SHE?
[MALACHY] DON'T KNOW.

18:19.050 --> 18:21.600
ALL WE KNOW IS SHE GAVE NED A
BOTTLE OF GOOD FRENCH RUM.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.350
[TERRI] HE'S DRINKING?

18:23.390 --> 18:26.060
THE LAST TIME NED WAS DRINKING
HE CRASHED HIS CAB, LOST HIS

18:26.100 --> 18:26.890
LICENSE.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.270
WE ALMOST LOST THE BUSINESS.

18:28.310 --> 18:29.940
IF HE'S DRINKING AGAIN--
[JAKE] LOOK THIS IS JUST THE

18:29.980 --> 18:31.860
BEGINNING STAGE OF THE
INVESTIGATION.

18:31.900 --> 18:33.150
[MALACHY] WE HAVEN'T GOT ALL
THE FACTS YET.

18:33.190 --> 18:34.820
[TERRI] YOU KNOW ALL THESE
YEARS WHEN HE SLIPPED ON THE

18:34.860 --> 18:36.530
BOTTLE I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT.

18:36.570 --> 18:39.870

19:53.610 --> 19:55.400
[JAKE] I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD HIM TO HIT ME.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.570
[MALACHY] YOU'RE SUCH A BABY!

19:58.610 --> 20:02.610

[LESLIE] WHAT DO YOU WANT TO

25:16.930 --> 25:20.310
[JAKE] IT'S JUST A
CASE I'M WORKING ON.

25:20.350 --> 25:21.640
[LESLIE] IS THIS WHAT WE DO

25:21.680 --> 25:23.100
[JAKE] WHAT?
[LESLIE] YOU ASK ME FOR

25:23.140 --> 25:25.770

25:33.780 --> 25:35.610
I MEAN NOT REALLY.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.070
[LESLIE] WHATEVER.

25:37.110 --> 25:38.660
THE REASON YOU CAN'T FIND
MAURICE BECKER IS BECAUSE HE

25:38.700 --> 25:39.830
DOESN'T LIVE HERE.

25:39.870 --> 25:43.200
[JAKE] OKAY, DOES HE LIVE IN
ST-PIERRE?

25:43.250 --> 25:45.500
[LESLIE] OH SO YOU CAN FIGURE
OUT SOMETHING ON YOUR OWN?

25:45.540 --> 25:50.550

THERE'S BEEN CANADA WIDE
WARRANTS OUT ON HIM FOR YEARS.

25:51.210 --> 25:54.220
[JAKE] THANKS.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

25:55.510 --> 25:57.340
[LESLIE] YEAH, IT'S NOT HARD

25:58.600 --> 25:59.720
[LESLIE] NOTHING, FORGET IT.

JUST DO ME A FAVOUR AND DON'T
CALL ME FOR A WHILE, A LONG

26:03.730 --> 26:06.140
WHILE. I GOT BETTER THINGS TO
DO THAN SPENDING MY TIME

26:06.190 --> 26:08.560
FEEDING YOU INFORMATION, WHILE
YOU PRETEND TO STARE AT MY

26:08.610 --> 26:15.610
CHEST.

26:32.210 --> 26:34.170
[TERRI] OH THE RUM THING,
YOUR BIG PLAN, WHY?!

26:34.210 --> 26:35.800
[NED] FOR THE COMPANY ALRIGHT?!

26:35.840 --> 26:38.680
WE'RE NOT MAKING THE KIND OF
MONEY AT THIS CAB THING
AS YOU THINK WE ARE WOMAN.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.300
[TERRI] NO, NO.
I DO THE BOOKS OKAY.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.680

26:41.720 --> 26:44.470
[NED] CAUSE I'M BRINGING IN THE
MONEY! IT'S FROM THE BOOZE,

26:44.520 --> 26:46.430
IT'S NOT FROM THE FARES!

26:46.480 --> 26:51.060
THE CABBIES GET A CUT AND WE
GET THE REST.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.900
[TERRI] WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

26:52.940 --> 26:55.940
[NED] WELL IT'S NOT LIKE WE'VE
BEEN EXACTLY CLOSE NOW IS IT?

26:59.910 --> 27:01.530
I DID IT FOR US.

27:02.660 --> 27:06.580
[TERRI] OH NED,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT US INTO?

27:06.620 --> 27:07.910
[MALACHY] WE SHOULD GO TO THE
POLICE.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.250
[NED] YOU KIDDING ME?

27:09.290 --> 27:10.290
I COULD GO TO JAIL.

27:10.330 --> 27:12.040

WE CAN'T GO TO THE COPS.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.250
[JAKE] GUYS, IF WE DON'T GO TO
THE COPS THE BEATINGS WILL

27:14.300 --> 27:16.880
NEVER STOP.
[NED] I MADE ONE LITTLE MISTAKE

27:16.920 --> 27:19.090
ALRIGHT? I KNEW THEY WERE
SHIPPING IN BOOZE FROM

27:19.130 --> 27:22.720
ST-PIERRE, SO I HIGH JACKED
A SHIPMENT.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.060
[JAKE] YOU RIPPED OFF RUM
RUNNERS?

27:25.100 --> 27:27.310
[MALACHY] THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE BEATINGS.

27:27.350 --> 27:29.520
[NED] LOOK, WE SOLD ALL THE
STUFF WE ROBBED. EVERYBODY

27:29.560 --> 27:31.350
WANTED MORE. THE PHONE KEPT
RINGING OFF THE HOOK.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.650
MCCOY, MCCOY..

27:33.690 --> 27:37.740
SO I FOUND A NEW SUPPLIER.

27:37.780 --> 27:43.700
[TERRI] OH RIGHT, THE GIRL.
[NED] THE GIRL.

27:43.740 --> 27:47.870
TERRI, DO YOU HAVE A MIRROR
OR WHAT?

27:47.910 --> 27:53.000
THERE'S NO WAY I'D GO OUT ON
YOU, OKAY? EVER.

27:53.040 --> 27:58.050
[JAKE] OKAY, AS SWEET
AS THAT IS, THIS BECKER GUY,
HE'S SERIOUS TROUBLE.

28:00.090 --> 28:02.090
[TERRI] WELL CAN YOU HELP US?

[NED] WELL?

28:06.310 --> 28:08.310

28:22.110 --> 28:23.110

28:31.920 --> 28:33.920
[WAITER] &lt;SPEAKING IN FRENCH&gt;

28:40.510 --> 28:41.510
[MALACHY] HI.

28:56.610 --> 29:01.900
[MAURICE] PARLEZ FRANCAIS?
[MALACHY] NO, A LITTLE.

29:01.950 --> 29:02.900
UN PEUX.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.240
[MAURICE] &lt;SPEAKING IN FRENCH&gt;

29:06.280 --> 29:10.410
[JAKE] IT'S ST. JOHNS.
[MAURICE] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

29:10.450 --> 29:13.080
GOD.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.790
JUST SHAGGING WITH YOU BOSS.

29:14.830 --> 29:16.840
SIT DOWN, LORD GOD.

29:26.510 --> 29:28.560
IF YOU DON'T KNOW THIS ISLAND,

29:28.600 --> 29:30.850
THERE IS A FEW
POINTS OF INTEREST.

29:30.890 --> 29:34.350
THE FISHING GEAR IS THE SAME AS
AT HOME, AND THE BOATS,

29:34.390 --> 29:35.900
AND THE FISHING.

29:35.940 --> 29:40.820
BUT THEY CATCHES THEM DIFFERENT
OVER HERE.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.530
THEY DRIES IT DIFFERENT.

29:42.570 --> 29:46.160
AND BOYS, THEY SURE COOKS IT
DIFFERENT.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.280
THIS ISLAND, SO CLOSE TO HOME.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.040
BUT IT'S FRANCE.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.330
NEVER SEIZES TO AMAZE ME.

29:53.370 --> 29:56.120
NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG,
THERE IS A LEVEL OF SELF

29:56.170 --> 29:58.250
CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT THE PLACE,
YOU KNOW IT'S EUROPE BUT IT'S

29:58.290 --> 30:00.960
NOT, IT'S NEW FOUNDLAND BUT
IT'S NOT.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.550
BORDEAUX BOYS?

30:02.590 --> 30:06.470
[MALACHY] YEAH,
BORDEAUX WOULD BE GOOD, THANKS.

30:06.510 --> 30:08.470
[MAURICE] ANOTHER POINT OF
INTEREST WOULD BE THE...

30:08.510 --> 30:10.430
FLOOR BOARD OVER THERE.

30:10.470 --> 30:15.020
THAT'S WHERE A BULLET
NEARLY DID IN AL CAPONE

30:15.060 --> 30:17.060
ALL THEM YEARS AGO.

30:17.100 --> 30:19.190
SOME HISTORY HERE BOYS.

30:19.230 --> 30:24.860
CAPONE... HIM...

30:24.900 --> 30:27.910
SITTING WHERE
YOU FELLAS ARE NOW.

30:30.950 --> 30:34.000
GOOD COMPANY BOY.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.330
DO YOU KNOW WHY HE DODGED
THE BULLET?

30:36.370 --> 30:41.750
CAUSE CAPONE ALWAYS STAYED
TWO STEPS AHEAD.

30:41.790 --> 30:43.880
RUM RUNNING..

30:43.920 --> 30:47.300
COUNTRY YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS
BEEN PART OF THE FABRIC.

30:47.340 --> 30:48.510
BUILT IN.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.010
WAY OF LIFE, YOU KNOW?

30:50.050 --> 30:52.100
PART OF THE HERITAGE.

30:52.140 --> 30:53.510
THE ECONOMY.

30:54.850 --> 30:56.230
NOW---

31:04.110 --> 31:10.030

31:10.070 --> 31:13.080
COME OVER HERE AND SIT

31:16.120 --> 31:18.330
[JAKE] ANYTHING HAPPENS TO US

31:18.370 --> 31:21.420
ROYAL NEWFOUNDLAND CONSTABULARY
TO KNOW THAT WE CAME OVER HERE.

31:21.460 --> 31:23.710

32:18.180 --> 32:19.520
&lt;MAURICE HITS THE TABLE&gt;
[MAURICE] ALTHOUGH...

32:19.560 --> 32:25.060
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT
THERE'S A RAT IN ST-PIERRE,

32:25.110 --> 32:26.520
A BIG ONE.

32:26.570 --> 32:30.950

OVER MY BUSINESS IN ST. JOHNS,

32:30.990 --> 32:32.110

32:32.160 --> 32:36.780
WHO IS SUPPLYING BISHOP TAXI
WITH ST-PIERRE RUM

32:36.830 --> 32:39.200
BEHIND MY BACK?

32:39.250 --> 32:42.370
&lt;MAURICE HITS THE TABLE&gt;
WHO'S THE RAT?

32:42.420 --> 32:45.590

OBSERVANT AREN'T YOU?

32:51.760 --> 32:53.890

32:58.680 --> 33:04.650

BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

[MAURICE] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

33:08.940 --> 33:10.780
I CAN'T LEAVE HERE.

33:10.820 --> 33:14.410
I WAS BORN IN GRAND BANK
AND RAISED IN ST. JOHNS. BUT ME

33:14.450 --> 33:15.950
MOTHER IS FROM MARSEILLES.

33:15.990 --> 33:19.240
THIS IS AS CLOSE AS I'M GONNA
GET TO GOING HOME,

33:19.290 --> 33:21.540
TO NEWFOUNDLAND.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.960
