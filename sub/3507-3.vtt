00:04.400 --> 00:06.300
Jezebel

00:07.400 --> 00:11.400
There's a ringing in my ear

00:19.200 --> 00:20.900
Reading the paper? You are gonna lose

00:20.900 --> 00:24.700
All of your wired-Teen-Hyper-
Texting-Nano-Gizmo street cred.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.700
–I'm a rebel. I kick it old-School.
–Is this— 

00:27.700 --> 00:29.400
–Cream, two sugars.
–Thanks.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
The style section.
Anything I need to know?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.000
–The '70s are back.
–Mm.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.700
They're like the highlander.
They just won't die.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.800
Good morning, mother.
You're dressed early.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.700
–Oh, I have class.
–I believe that's a matter of some debate.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.100
–Ooh.
–Ha ha ha ha.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.800
At the new school, funny man.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.900
Look, it's— It's not

00:48.900 --> 00:50.800
That I don't appreciate
everything you've done—

00:50.800 --> 00:53.300
But a girl has to stand
on her own two feet.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.900
What's the class?

00:54.900 --> 00:57.400
Introduction to life coaching.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.800
It's— It's always been my desire
to make a difference,

00:59.800 --> 01:01.600
Whether onstage or off,
and…

01:02.300 --> 01:03.600
I…

01:03.600 --> 01:04.800
Have had cards made.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.300
That's my— I'm— You—
It says here I'm your client.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.400
Well, of course you are.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.600
Haven't I been telling you
what to do your whole life?

01:13.600 --> 01:16.100
Oh, uh, dad, julie Schmidt's
father is back in rehab,

01:16.200 --> 01:18.600
So a spot opened up
to chaperone the d.C. Trip.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.500
Where is the— How did you know
julie's dad was back in rehab?

01:21.500 --> 01:23.200
Must be a wired-Teen-Hyper-Nano thing.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.600
–So what do you say?
–Sorry, kiddo, but, uh, with you away,

01:26.600 --> 01:28.600
My chaperoning needs reside here,

01:28.600 --> 01:30.600
or are you forgetting what happened
the last time we left her alone?

01:30.600 --> 01:34.500
–So she… had a little party.
–There were lime shards embedded in the walls.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.600
It was cinco de mayo.

01:36.900 --> 01:37.900
Exactly.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.600
I hear dead people.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.900
Who was murdered, and was it gruesome?

01:45.900 --> 01:46.800
One victim—

01:46.800 --> 01:48.500
Donald kendall, 18.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.600
He was a senior at redding prep.

01:51.100 --> 01:53.000
–Someone's gonna miss prom night.
–Redding prep?

01:53.000 --> 01:56.800
–Private school on park avenue.
–No trust fund baby left behind.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.500
–What's he doing in the boat?
–No idea.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.100
–Dr Parish, how are you doing?
–Feet are cold.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.400
So what do you got for me?

02:03.400 --> 02:06.400
Single g.S.W. To the chest,
fairly large caliber.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.300
And from the lack of blood inside the boat,

02:08.300 --> 02:10.199
I'd say he wasn't killed at sea.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.500
Somebody moved him. He's got dirt
and grass all on his chucky t's.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.400
Other than the postmortem voyage,

02:15.400 --> 02:16.700
Looks like a pop and drop.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.700
–I'm guessing sometime late last night.
–Well, somebody dragged him here.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.200
He couldn't have come from very far.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.600
Let's get uniforms down here
to do a perimeter walk.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.600
Get 'em to go from the boats
over there down to fifth.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.800
And tell 'em they're looking for a
blood pool and possible shell casings.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
Roger that.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.600
–Esposito, did you check the boathouse?
–Not yet.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.400
So why the burial at sea?

02:35.700 --> 02:38.700
The vikings believed that if you wanted
to reach valhalla, you need a vessel.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.700
Gun-Toting viking— That's your theory?

02:41.700 --> 02:44.200
No, no, no. They also launched their
dead with a sacrificial woman…

02:45.000 --> 02:46.800
And some booze an a good horse.

Castle S1 ep03

02:53.200 --> 02:55.100
Do you know what he would've
been doing in the park?

02:55.600 --> 02:56.500
No.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.600
When was the last time
you saw your son alive?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.700
Yesterday, uh, when he left for school.

03:02.100 --> 03:05.500
Do you know maybe where he went
after? He was usually with his friends.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.700
He didn't come home for dinner?

03:06.700 --> 03:10.300
Most nights, donny ate out
or at someone else's place.

03:10.300 --> 03:13.000
He hung out with a pretty
tight crowd at redding.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.600
They've all been together
since grammar school.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.800
Donny used to have them over all the time.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.400
Only, you've moved recently.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.600
–Yes, a few months ago.
–I was a partner at lehman.

03:25.800 --> 03:29.000
When it went under, well,
we— We took a big hit.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.300
That can be pretty tough on a teenager.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.200
You get used to a certain way of living,

03:34.200 --> 03:36.500
But it was no one's fault.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.000
Do you think donny was depressed?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.300
No, donny was strong.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.000
But to lose everything you have…

03:44.300 --> 03:45.600
We were just getting by.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.700
I'm very sorry for your loss.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.600
How did you know they moved?

03:54.600 --> 03:56.600
Either the kendalls really like art

03:56.600 --> 03:59.800
Or that chinese screen was meant
for a much bigger apartment.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.600
I wonder how they could still afford redding.

04:02.100 --> 04:04.000
–You know the school?
–Oh, I've been kicked out

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Of all of new York's finer educational
institutions at least once.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.500
The irony is, now that I'm rich and famous,

04:09.500 --> 04:11.200
They all claim me as alum and want money.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.100
–It is just so rough being you.
–My cross to bear.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.700
When the kendalls said they couldn't
afford tuition, we put donny on scholarship.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.700
The family had been
very generous in the past,

04:20.200 --> 04:21.600
And donny was one of our brightest.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.300
We thought he'd do great things.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.700
Any idea what he would've been
doing in central park at night?

04:25.800 --> 04:26.800
Well, the truth is,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.600
All these kids are icebergs.
We only see the tip.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.500
If you wanna know the rest,

04:31.500 --> 04:33.200
You should probably talk to his friends—

04:34.900 --> 04:38.000
Amanda, romy, brandon, spencer and max.

04:38.300 --> 04:40.200
It's strange seeing them without donny.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.800
Thank you.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.200
Thanks.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.000
Breaking news— My parents
are off to abu dhabi,

04:47.200 --> 04:51.200
So I'm in a 'rents-Free zone. Come over tonight
for he “dancing with the stars” results show.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.700
Betting opens at 7:30.

04:52.700 --> 04:57.400
My dad's cask-Aged, 16-Year-Old
single malt opens next.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.000
That was before they moved and everything.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.400
Were any of you with donny last night?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.700
We hung out after school,
but we all headed home around 5:00.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.600
Do you know of any reason
he'd be in the park?

05:12.900 --> 05:14.300
Look, you guys, I went to York.

05:14.300 --> 05:17.800
I know all about honor codes
and protecting your friends.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.800
–You went to York prep?
–How does a yorkie end up a cop?

05:20.900 --> 05:24.400
Things happen. Things like this.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.400
Point is, is that if you're trying to
protect your friend's memory, I get it.

05:28.900 --> 05:30.700
But eventually, the truth comes out.

05:31.200 --> 05:35.000
And the faster it does, the easier
it'll be for us to help find who did it.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.100
His family had lost everything.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.300
Not that we cared,
but we go out, you know?

05:41.300 --> 05:45.300
We always offered to cover him,
but he couldn't handle it.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.100
–Yeah, he just kinda fell apart.
–Fell apart how?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.000
Guys, he can't get in trouble.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.500
He kind of got into drugs.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.900
If he had money problems,
how'd he support a drug habit?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.400
He started dealing… in the park.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.200
Classic tragedy.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.500
Prominent family falls into disrepute,

06:09.600 --> 06:12.300
–Scion spirals down…
–and bad things happen.

06:12.300 --> 06:14.500
Of course bad things happen.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a tragedy.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.800
Did you know, in the original greek,
“Tragedy“ literally means ”goat song"?

06:18.200 --> 06:20.000
I know, it doesn't make
any sense to me, either.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.500
But whatever that first story was,

06:21.500 --> 06:24.100
I can't help but think bad things
must've happened to that goat.

06:24.600 --> 06:30.400
Beckett. Mm-Hmm. Yep. Okay.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.400
Of course. Sure, I'll be right there.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.800
Next time, put it on speakerphone.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.400
I'm gonna want to see the pictures of
tose plaid skirts and knee socks.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.200
Excuse me?

06:44.200 --> 06:46.300
I've seen those York school uniforms.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.500
Okay, I want in on your poker game.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.000
I went to public school.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.300
I just told them that
to make them feel comfortable.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.500
Well played, Ms. Streep.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.300
Which meryl— “Out of Africa” or “mamma mia!”?

06:59.300 --> 07:00.000
Hmm.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.500
–Hey.
–Hey.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.200
So a 9-1 call comes in last
night about 50 yards from here.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.500
–Esposito's following up,
–but we found this.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.100
Looks like mud. It's actually blood.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.400
Figured he was sitting on top of the bench,

07:12.200 --> 07:15.400
Takes one to the chest,
Falls back over here…

07:16.300 --> 07:17.900
And then he's dragged to the lake.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.500
So what's he doing sitting
on a park bench at night?

07:21.700 --> 07:24.300
During my narc days, this area
was pretty much an open bazaar,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.200
–Especially at night.
–A drug deal gone bad.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.800
Fancy private school education
don't mean you aren't stupid.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.600
–Neither does a career in narcotics.
–What are you talking about?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.500
This is a very large pool of blood.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.200
Lanie said he was shot
with a large-Caliber bullet.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.900
So if this kid is dragged
when he's a fresh kill,

07:37.900 --> 07:40.600
Wouldn't there be more of a blood trail?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.500
He was lying here for a while.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.600
Why would someone come back and move him?

07:45.100 --> 07:47.400
If it was a drug dealer,
then he's gonna realize

07:47.400 --> 07:49.800
The cops are gonnathink drug
dealer if they find a body here.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.500
Increasing his chances of getting caught.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.800
So he drags the body over there
just to try to throw us off.

07:59.300 --> 08:01.500
I don't know, castle. Asmartdrug dealer?

08:02.700 --> 08:04.800
Ah, everything evolves.
Why not criminals?

08:07.300 --> 08:08.200
9-1-1 caller?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.800
Yeah, Mrs. Falcigno—

08:09.900 --> 08:12.200
Was walking her dog when she
heard the shot last night.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.600
A few seconds later, said she
saw a white dude run past her.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.600
I got her looking through mug books
at dealers arrested in that area.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.800
Hey, detective, get over here!

08:25.100 --> 08:26.700
See someone you recognize, Mrs. Falcigno?

08:26.700 --> 08:29.200
No, I miss your sparkling personality. Yeah!

08:29.200 --> 08:32.500
–That's the guy I saw right here.
–You sure?

08:32.600 --> 08:34.900
What, do you want to give me
a lie detector? That's him!

08:36.799 --> 08:38.000
Do you know why you're here?

08:38.700 --> 08:39.799
No idea.

08:40.700 --> 08:43.299
The arresting officer said that he saw you

08:43.299 --> 08:46.100
In a hand-To-Hand sale of narcotics in the park.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.600
Must have me confused with somebody else.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.800
Really? Is that what you're giving me,

08:49.800 --> 08:51.500
That all drug dealers look alike?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.600
You were arrested with money
and dope, Mr. Scoville.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.700
Given the fact that you have two
prior felony sales on your sheet,

08:59.700 --> 09:02.000
you should probably come up
with something better pretty quick.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.400
–Why you jammin' me up like this?
–What were you doing in the park last night?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.200
What makes you think I was even in the park?

09:06.200 --> 09:10.600
A very reliable witness said she saw you
Runnin' toward 72nd street about midnight.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.900
Shouldn't she put him on his heels,

09:11.900 --> 09:14.300
–Go straight for the shooting?
–It's not about putting him on his heels.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.900
It's about building a case for the d.A.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.100
So? I was running in the park. So what?

09:20.100 --> 09:22.700
See? She just got him to put
himself at the crime scene.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.300
So running isn't illegal,
but shootin' someone is.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.800
Shootin' someone?

09:28.600 --> 09:31.000
Do you recognize this person— Donny kendall?

09:31.700 --> 09:32.700
Never seen him before.

09:32.700 --> 09:36.700
Really? How come I'm getting the feeling that
you're not being completely truthful with me?

09:36.900 --> 09:38.500
Watch this. Watch her now.

09:40.900 --> 09:41.900
I want immunity.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.400
From what? The mumps?

09:45.000 --> 09:47.300
Do you know what a 3-Time loser is, scoville?

09:48.100 --> 09:50.800
It's a person facing a third felony conviction,

09:50.800 --> 09:52.700
Someone just like you, in fact.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.300
All right. I seen him.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.300
–Last night?
–Yeah, last night.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.400
–Just placed him with the victim.
–You sell to him?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.900
–No.
–You're a drug dealer.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.000
How'd you know him? You poker buddies?

10:11.500 --> 10:14.000
It was real nice chatting
with you, Mr. Scoville.

10:15.100 --> 10:17.500
Maybe you can drop me a line
in about 25 years.

10:18.900 --> 10:20.600
All right, all right,
hold up. Hold up. All right!

10:22.900 --> 10:24.600
–I sold to him.
–When?

10:24.800 --> 10:26.000
Last night.

10:26.700 --> 10:29.500
Bunch of other times, too,
him and his little buddies.

10:33.300 --> 10:37.200
–What little buddies?
–I don't know. Kids. Friends of his.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.000
–Describe 'em.
–A couple of dudes,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
a couple of chicks. One was asian.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.500
Kinda hot.

10:43.400 --> 10:46.100
Okay, so you're telling me
that you saw all of them

10:46.100 --> 10:48.700
–In the park last night, right?
–Yep.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.000
And now we got some witnesses.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.800
Witnesses who lied.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.500
You guys lied to me.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.600
You were all with donny when
he got shot, weren't you?

11:07.700 --> 11:09.800
Anyone know what obstruction is?

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
I believe that's when you deliberately
give false information in a criminal case.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.200
You go to prison for it.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.000
Max?

11:25.900 --> 11:26.900
Amanda?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.100
Yeah, we were there.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.400
You were at the park?

11:35.100 --> 11:37.600
Donny was out of control.
We were just trying to stop him.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.100
Why don't I believe you?

11:44.200 --> 11:45.800
Guys, just tell the truth.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.400
Sometimes we'd go to the park, too.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.700
We'd tell our parents we're hanging
out at one of our apartments,

11:56.700 --> 11:59.900
But we'd actually go to the park
and party, And donny would—

11:59.900 --> 12:01.700
Would get you whatever you wanted.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.800
So what happened?

12:08.100 --> 12:10.700
We're all just hanging out,
having a good time, partying.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.100
And this guy came over, and he's all
messed up, and he's got this gun.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.700
And he— And he's— He's yelling
at donny, "where's my money?

12:17.700 --> 12:20.900
I need my friggin' money!”
Donny owes him 200 bucks.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.700
–Donny didn't have it.
–Then the guy points the gun.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.200
And there's this loud pop,
And you just see donny's body crumple.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.100
–What did you guys do?
–We ran. We just ran.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.800
You didn't think to call the police?

12:30.800 --> 12:33.700
He was dead. I mean, we knew
he was dead. Calling someone—

12:33.700 --> 12:36.800
–Would have just gotten you into trouble?
–Did you get a good look at this guy?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.400
Do you think you'd be able to identify him?

12:44.400 --> 12:47.000
It— It was dark. You know, donny
was at the end of the bench.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.600
Who was the closest?

12:52.400 --> 12:53.400
Okay, romy, this will be easy.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.900
And when we raise the shades,
they won't be able to see you.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.900
–Are you sure?
–I promise.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.600
They have no idea who's back here.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.500
You just let me know if you
recognize anyone, okay?

13:06.400 --> 13:07.800
Raise the shades, please.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.200
Number 1, step forward.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.300
Step back, number 1.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.400
Step back.

13:25.100 --> 13:25.800
Number 2.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.200
Number 2, step forward.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.300
Do you recognize anyone?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.100
Number 2.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.600
Where do you recognize him from?

13:42.600 --> 13:43.800
The park.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.100
He shot donny.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.500
Okay.

13:50.000 --> 13:56.074

14:02.000 --> 14:04.700
Are you trying to figure out how to
murder someone in their sleep again?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.100
Not this time.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.200
Do you know when you were little,

14:08.900 --> 14:11.400
I used to watch you sleep every
night before I went to bed,

14:11.400 --> 14:12.700
Just for a few minutes.

14:13.600 --> 14:17.300
It was ridiculous how adorable you were.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.000
Who'd have thought,
all these years later,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.100
You're still adorable?

14:21.100 --> 14:24.300
What part of snoring
and drooling is adorable?

14:24.300 --> 14:27.300
Well, every 10 or 15 breaths,
you make a little snort noise.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.200
And then sometimes you'll
even get a little spit bubble—

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
Okay, dad. Seriously.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.600
Do you do drugs?

14:38.300 --> 14:38.900
No.

14:38.900 --> 14:41.300
Are you sure?
'Cause you can tell me.

14:41.300 --> 14:44.400
Dad, am I lethargic and
uncharacteristically irritable?

14:44.400 --> 14:47.000
–No.
–Are my eyes bloodshot for no apparent reason?

14:47.200 --> 14:49.500
–No, except when you're sick.
–Well, that's an apparent reason.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.200
–Right.
–Are my grades plummeting?

14:51.200 --> 14:51.800
No.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.300
Then according to new York city's
guidelines for parents and teachers,

14:54.300 --> 14:56.600
it's a pretty safe bet I'm clean.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.100
–You make an excellent case.
–Parents are invited to the drug assemblies.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.400
–You should come next time.
–Drug assemblies? Is tg 'em nowadays?

15:04.500 --> 15:05.500
They serve cookies.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.600
And which of your friends are
going on this d.C. Jamboree with you?

15:08.700 --> 15:09.900
Taylor, kelsey and paige.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.800
Okay, how do I know they're not bringing
the blow and partying winehouse-Style?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.900
Um, because you know them really well,

15:16.900 --> 15:19.900
–And they're good kids?
–But maybe they're icebergs.

15:21.100 --> 15:23.900
Does this have something to
do with that redding kid?

15:26.000 --> 15:29.200
Dad, he was in central park
really, really late at night.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.200
That's something I would never do.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.800
But if you did, you could tell me.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.000
I don't want you to feel
you ever have to lie to me.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.700
Anything you and your friends
have done, believe me,

15:38.900 --> 15:40.200
–I've done worse.
–I know.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.700
But the good news is, I'm not you.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.800
I just mean you don't have to worry.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.800
Besides, if I ever got in any real trouble,
my friends would be there to bail me out.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.800
Right.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.700
Because that's what friends do.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.100
Yeah.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.300
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.800
Excuse me, I gotta go. I gotta go.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.000
Why didn't donny's friends
just give him the money?

16:12.400 --> 16:15.300
–What are you talking about?
–These kidsalwayshave cash.

16:15.300 --> 16:17.900
You're gonna tell me one of them couldn't
spring a few bucks yo save his life?

16:17.900 --> 16:21.000
Castle, some demented drug
dealer's waving a gun.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.600
Um, they probably froze up. But all of them?

16:23.600 --> 16:26.200
He wasn't asking s.A.T. Questions.
He was asking for money,

16:26.200 --> 16:28.300
something these kids probably
count in their sleep.

16:29.700 --> 16:32.000
Look, this scoville is a bad dude,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
–And we got more than enough.
–Yeah, with the girl, it's a slam dunk.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.400
And who gave you the girl?

16:37.300 --> 16:38.500
Scoville.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.300
So the guy's not a genius.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.500
Okay, okay. Say you're right.

16:44.700 --> 16:47.100
Why would these kids peg
the wrong guy for a murder?

16:47.100 --> 16:50.100
Simple— One of them did it.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.800
–Hey, Beckett.
–Yankman.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.600
–Who's the sidekick?
–He's a…

17:03.800 --> 17:04.900
–Consultant?
–Consultant.

17:04.900 --> 17:10.000
Yeah? Well, uh, shouldn't you consult the
consultant before you arrest the wrong guy?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.500
I'm not sure I have the
wrong guy yet, yankman.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.099
Well, my client's not happy.
He gave you potential witnesses,

17:17.099 --> 17:18.900
And then you used one against him.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.000
Yeah, well, your client
wasn't exactly forthcoming.

17:22.500 --> 17:26.200
But I'm willing to reconsider
if he tells me everything he knows.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.200
Don't trust her.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.300
Seeing as how you're facing a murder charge,
Why don't you just go with the flow?

17:30.300 --> 17:33.100
Consultant boy is right.
You got nothing to lose.

17:34.400 --> 17:37.700
The night that donny was killed,
You sold to him and his friends, right?

17:38.400 --> 17:39.900
–No.
–No?

17:40.700 --> 17:42.700
That's not how you really
get her to reconsider.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.100
I didn't sell to him!

17:46.000 --> 17:47.100
They was workin' for me.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.500
Workin' for you?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.400
I supplied that punk.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.900
All right? His friends bought off me, too.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.300
Then they'd go play dealer, selling
to the upscales up in sheeps meadow.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.900
Wait a minute. They sold for you?

17:59.900 --> 18:03.700
Donny, yeah. The others,
it was just like a goof,

18:03.700 --> 18:06.000
Like walk on the wild side,
like truth or dare.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.800
So where were you when donny got shot?

18:07.800 --> 18:11.000
I was hanging with my boys down
by the “alice in wonderland” statue.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.700
We didn't see nothing.
We heard the shot, took off.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.400
–What about the gun?
–I told you, I don't pack.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.700
Criminal record with no firearms convictions
does sort of give it the ring of truth.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.900
If past is prologue, how we
doing on reconsideration?

18:27.800 --> 18:29.500
Don't have to answer if you don't want.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.800
I know the answer. Anytime.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.300
Anytime, Beckett.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.000
You gotta be kidding me.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.100
–I already told the brass that we got the guy.
–I can see how that'd be a little awkward.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.700
The mayor even called to thank me.

18:43.100 --> 18:44.800
–He's in for the knicks game, by the way.
–Sweet.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.700
Look, I know everyone likes the
violent drug dealer for this—

18:47.700 --> 18:50.000
No, welovethe violent drug dealer for this.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.100
Only the violent drug dealer's story
makes more sense than our witness'.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.200
Plus— And I know I'm new here—

18:55.200 --> 18:57.500
But aren't you supposed to arrest the right guy?

18:59.500 --> 19:00.900
Okay, go and talk to the girl again.

19:00.900 --> 19:04.100
But my violent drug dealer stays
where he is until I say so.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.800
–I'll see you at the game.
–Got it.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.400
So this dealer asked donny for the
couple hundred he owed him, right?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.700
–Yeah.
–And donny told him he didn't have it?

19:16.800 --> 19:17.300
Right.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.800
–You mind if I take a look at your purse?
–Her purse? What for?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.400
I can get a warrant if you want.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.200
–Gucci.
–What does my bag have to do with anything?

19:36.600 --> 19:39.200
If donny was such a good friend,
why did you let him get shot?

19:39.600 --> 19:40.600
Let him?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.500
You had more than enough money
to pay off the guy.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.400
I bet you all had more than enough.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.200
And yet donny is dead.

19:49.700 --> 19:51.700
Why didn't any of you
front him the money?

19:51.700 --> 19:54.300
–What are you implying?
–She isn't implying.

19:54.300 --> 19:57.000
She's saying your daughter is lying
about what happened that night.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.500
There wasn't a guy, was there, romy?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.100
I–I didn't do anything.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.300
Romy.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
What really happened
to donny that night?

20:15.900 --> 20:17.300
It was an accident.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.700
–We were just playing a game.
–A game?

20:20.700 --> 20:23.900
–Like russian roulette.
–Romy! With a gun?

20:23.900 --> 20:26.700
It was just for fun. We—
We did it all the time.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.900
–Forfun?
–Where'd you get the gun, romy?

20:30.500 --> 20:31.800
Spencer had it.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.000
We never meant for there to be bullets.
We just pointed the gun at each other

20:35.000 --> 20:37.400
And pulled the trigger,
just to see what it felt like.

20:37.400 --> 20:39.100
Then how did donny get shot?

20:40.200 --> 20:42.000
Spencer bought bullets.

20:42.200 --> 20:46.000
We went up to his summer house in montauk
Just to shoot around at cans and stuff.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.900
One must have got left in by accident.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.200
Who? Who shot him?

20:54.800 --> 20:55.700
Romy, look at me.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.100
Who shot donny?

21:01.600 --> 21:02.600
Max.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.000
It was max.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.700
Detective Kate Beckett, nypd.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.100
I'm looking for max heller. Is he here?

21:11.200 --> 21:13.700
No. I'm his mother.
What's going on?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.300
I need to see him right now, Mrs. Heller.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.100
–Do you know where he is?
–No, I don't. What is it?

21:20.700 --> 21:22.200
I have a warrant for his arrest.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.800
A warrant? Oh, my God. For what?

21:25.100 --> 21:28.200
He's wanted for murder, Mrs.
Heller. Do you understand?

21:29.200 --> 21:30.900
I need you to go and call
him on his cell phone,

21:30.900 --> 21:32.400
Find out where he is,
tell him not to move.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.900
Everything is gonna be all right,
But I need you to do it now.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.800
Detective esposito will go with you.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.600
Get a photograph of him for the a.P.B., please.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.300
Right.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.400
Detective.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.300
Beckett.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.500
What? Where?

21:52.800 --> 21:54.200
The kid's not answering his cell phone.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.400
Mom thinks maybe he went to the park.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.000
Yeah, he went to the park…
and killed himself.

22:02.700 --> 22:04.700
So what now? What should I do?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.200
What?

22:21.600 --> 22:24.500
Hey. If you're looking for lunch money,
My wallet's on the nightstand.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.000
I lied to you, dad.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.600
–Oh. Can this wait?
–No. You need to know.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.200
Oh. Yeah.

22:37.300 --> 22:39.300
Yeah, o-Okay.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.200
Remember the holiday formal,

22:41.200 --> 22:43.500
How kelsey and I went
to Taylor's house after?

22:44.200 --> 22:46.000
Well, when we left,
it was already raining,

22:46.000 --> 22:47.900
And we tried for, like,
half an hour to get a taxi,

22:47.900 --> 22:50.500
But we couldn't, and we were
already so soaking wet and cold

22:50.500 --> 22:54.200
That we finally decided to take the subway,
Even though it was way after 10:00.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.800
Well, considering that getting a cab in the rain

22:56.800 --> 22:58.800
Is kind of like winning the powerball jackpot,

22:58.800 --> 23:01.200
–I forgive you.
–No, listen.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.900
The 2 was coming, and
kelsey ran through the door

23:02.900 --> 23:04.600
And was going down the
stairs to hold the door for me,

23:04.600 --> 23:06.100
but when I swiped my card, it was empty,

23:06.100 --> 23:07.900
And I didn't have any time
to add any more money to it,

23:07.900 --> 23:09.500
And kelsey was screaming
for me to come, and I was—

23:09.500 --> 23:11.100
I was just so tired, and I was
just anxious to get home,

23:11.100 --> 23:15.000
That, dad… I don't even want to say it.

23:15.400 --> 23:16.400
What?

23:17.500 --> 23:19.200
I jumped the turnstile.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.700
Did you make the train?

23:23.900 --> 23:26.500
Y–Yeah, but— But the point
is, I didn't tell you,

23:26.500 --> 23:29.600
Even after you were so sweet and
concerned yesterday. I'm sorry.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.100
Oh, you actually jumped the turnstile?

23:32.100 --> 23:34.900
But I swiped my card twice the
next day and didn't even ride.

23:36.100 --> 23:38.500
Okay. Oh, sweetie. If that—

23:38.500 --> 23:40.300
If that's the worst thing you've done,

23:40.300 --> 23:41.900
I'm a happy, happy man.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.800
But I lied to you.
Shouldn't you punish me?

23:45.900 --> 23:47.500
Yes. No, you're right.

23:47.500 --> 23:51.500
Um… mandatory ice cream
for breakfast. No excuses.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.700
–I'm serious. If you won't, I will.
–I'm serious about the ice cream.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.100
Fine. I'm grounded for a week.

23:57.100 --> 24:00.500
–All right. You're tough but fair.
–After the d.C. Trip.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.500
That's my girl.

24:06.200 --> 24:07.500
Thanks, dad.

24:11.600 --> 24:12.400
Hey.

24:12.600 --> 24:13.300
What you doing?

24:13.300 --> 24:16.500
Paperwork to dismiss the homicide
charges against scoville.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.200
Ballistics confirms that
the gun used on donny

24:20.200 --> 24:23.000
In the park that night was the
same one Max used on himself.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.900
–I'm usually better at reading people.
–You spent half an hour with max.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.400
There's no way you could
have seen that coming.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.900
Poor kid must have been a mess.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.300
Imagine shooting your best friend
and then having to lie about it.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.200
Well, he did more than just lie about it.

24:36.900 --> 24:37.800
What do you mean?

24:37.800 --> 24:39.900
He went back and moved his friend's body.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.700
He went back and moved his friend's body.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.100
Having the presence of mind to move the body

24:46.100 --> 24:49.000
Isn't exactly consistent with
a guilty conscience, is it?

24:51.100 --> 24:54.000
I'd say that's more an act
of a cold-Blooded killer.

24:54.100 --> 24:56.300
And a cold-Blooded killer
doun asesino a sangre fr?

24:56.300 --> 24:58.000
A guilty enough to commit suicide, does he?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.400
Not in any story I'd write.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.500
So if we're right and max
didn't move donny's body,

25:02.500 --> 25:03.500
Then who did?

25:08.100 --> 25:10.500
Looks like your basic,
garden-Variety suicide.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.400
But you said on the phone
that there was something

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
That wasn't consistent with a suicide.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.200
Looks likesuicide.

25:16.200 --> 25:19.000
But his shooting hand— More specifically,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.600
His right index finger— Has a slight abrasion

25:21.600 --> 25:23.200
Visible only under the scope.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.900
Department autopsy protocol doesn't even
call to look for that kind of thing.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.500
And the abrasion means what to you?

25:28.500 --> 25:31.000
That someone may have
helped him pull the trigger.

25:31.300 --> 25:34.700
Plus toxicology has his
blood alcohol content at.28.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.900
–.28!
–So he was drunk.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.900
Waydrunk.

25:39.400 --> 25:42.300
At.28, he may not have even been conscious.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.600
So max was murdered.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.500
Whoever staged max's suicide
wanted us to believe that

25:49.500 --> 25:51.800
He killed himself out of guilt
over shooting donny,

25:51.800 --> 25:54.800
Which makes me think max
didn't kill donny after all.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.600
The other kids corroborated romy's
story that max pulled the trigger.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.400
I didn't say he didn't shoot him.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.100
I said he didn't kill him.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.600
Is that the zen koan "one
hand clapping" thing? I…

26:03.600 --> 26:06.800
These kids played a game of
pretending to shoot at each other.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.400
What if one of them
wanted donny dead for real?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.900
What better way than to get
someone else to pull the trigger?

26:10.900 --> 26:14.700
You think one of the other kids put
a bullet in the gun without max knowing?

26:15.800 --> 26:16.900
That's our killer.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.300
Oh, I like that.

26:19.300 --> 26:20.800
You bought the bullets, spencer.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.400
It was just to screw around.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.800
If by “screwing around” you mean
intentionally putting a bullet

26:24.800 --> 26:27.600
in a chamber knowing that max
was gonna shoot donny, then yes,

26:27.900 --> 26:29.400
you and I are in total agreement.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.100
Detective Beckett— 

26:30.100 --> 26:33.500
If the point of the game
was to shootwithout bullets,

26:33.500 --> 26:36.200
Then why would you have bullets
unless you intended to use 'em?

26:36.200 --> 26:38.600
I told you, I didn't know there
were any bullets in the gun.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.300
Well, somebody did, and I think
whoever it is killed max.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.600
Your gun, your bullets—

26:43.600 --> 26:45.800
From where I'm standing,
spencer, you did it.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.000
So where were you between
6:30 and 9:00 last night?

26:51.700 --> 26:54.300
Uh… at— At my dad's club.

26:54.500 --> 26:56.100
The century. With brandon.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.400
You better hope that
brandon corroborates that.

27:05.100 --> 27:08.400
Look, I know romy and spencer
told you guys everything,

27:08.400 --> 27:09.700
And that we're all
in big trouble…

27:11.400 --> 27:12.800
–But I'm glad.
–You're glad?

27:12.800 --> 27:15.600
Yes. We should have just come clean
with you guys after the accident.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.000
You're damn right you should've.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
I know. But we didn't
want to screw max over.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.100
That's why you fingered the drug dealer,
right? 'Cause he's expendable.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.800
I told romy that was wrong,
but she wanted to protect max.

27:27.900 --> 27:30.500
And that junkie's the one who got
donny into dealing in the first place.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.100
So where were you when max was killed?

27:32.100 --> 27:34.400
With spencer at his dad's club.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.700
Ask him, he'll confirm it.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.700
You guys always have your
stories straight, don't you?

27:41.300 --> 27:44.000
“We weren't at the park.
It was the drug dealer.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.700
It was max. " You guys are always in sync.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.800
Maybe that's why I don't believe you.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.600
You don't have to believe me.

27:55.100 --> 27:56.400
I have proof.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.600
We'd take these videos, you know,

28:01.600 --> 28:04.300
I mean, just for laughs,
doing crazy stuff.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.700
Romy's dad Mr. Lee
is like this big I.T. Guy,

28:07.900 --> 28:10.500
And he hooked us up with
a file share over bluetooth.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.900
That way we'd all get the files.

28:19.100 --> 28:20.800
Amanda shot this that night.

28:20.900 --> 28:21.900
What is it?

28:22.500 --> 28:23.600
A video…

28:25.400 --> 28:26.700
Of Donny getting shot.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.600
We were all supposed to erase it.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.800
But I knew that if the truth came out,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.100
We'd all be screwed.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.900
And after what happened
to those kids in that duke case,

28:38.900 --> 28:39.800
I just…

28:41.900 --> 28:43.300
I didn't want to end up like that.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.600
Here.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.100
–Oh, yeah, suck it down, bran.
–Chug! Chug!

28:49.100 --> 28:51.100
–Suck it! Suck it!
–You suck.

28:51.100 --> 28:54.500
Little brandon wet himself!

28:54.500 --> 28:58.400
–Oh, great. “Punk'd” is back. Hi, mom!
–All right, let's do this, baby!

28:58.500 --> 29:00.000
Blast me, max-O. Take me out.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.700
Hey, you pulled my mom's
harry winston tennis bracelet.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.500
–That you stole.
–Borrowed.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.100
–That's worth my entire family.
–Cue the violins. Aw.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.900
Come on, guys. My arm's getting tired. Aw!

29:09.900 --> 29:12.000
–Let's do this!
–Okay, here we go.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.600
–Whoo!
–All right, all right.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.300
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

29:21.800 --> 29:25.000
Oh, my God!

29:27.700 --> 29:28.700
You okay?

29:30.100 --> 29:32.000
I was just thinking about donny's parents,

29:33.200 --> 29:35.300
What they'll go through
when they watch that video.

29:38.300 --> 29:40.800
Guess it's not too often you
get a murder caught on tape, huh?

29:42.100 --> 29:43.200
Yeah, well, he was smart to keep it.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.400
Otherwise they'd all be
facing a manslaughter charge.

29:47.300 --> 29:51.300
Yeah… that was pretty smart when
you think about it, wasn't it?

29:52.900 --> 29:54.500
I know that tone, castle.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.000
I'm just saying, It's pretty lucky they
filmed their little game that night.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.400
Yeah. Well, people post crazy stuff on youtube.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.800
I get filming it the first
few times. It's exciting.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.200
But the 10th? The 15th?

30:05.200 --> 30:06.600
What was so special about that night?

30:06.700 --> 30:09.300
–Donny got shot.
–So the only reason to film it is…

30:09.300 --> 30:11.400
You knew something was gonna happen.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.800
? Was when? Okay, thank you, Mrs. Kendall.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Get this—

30:24.000 --> 30:26.800
Donny and amanda were dating
until about a month ago.

30:27.400 --> 30:28.900
When donny broke it off?

30:34.900 --> 30:38.900
–You weren't in school?
–so? I wasn't up for it.

30:39.100 --> 30:43.100
–Yes. Lying can be so exhausting.
–So can losing two of your friends.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.900
–We saw the video.
–Brandon told me.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.500
So now you know everything.

30:47.600 --> 30:48.900
Why did you shoot the video that night?

30:48.900 --> 30:50.800
I don't know. We did lots of times.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.200
When was the last time beforethat night?

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
I don't remember. Look, I thought
you said you saw what happened.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.900
We did. We're just not sure
why we saw what happened.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.100
Your decision to make a video
that night doesn't make any sense

31:05.000 --> 31:06.800
Unless you knew something was gonna happen.

31:07.100 --> 31:08.900
You think I knew?

31:08.900 --> 31:11.700
It was totally an accident!

31:11.800 --> 31:15.100
There's no way I could have
known Donny was gonna get shot.

31:15.100 --> 31:16.400
Sure there is,

31:16.700 --> 31:18.400
If you're the one who put
a bullet in the gun.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.400
What?

31:20.400 --> 31:23.200
We spoke to donny's parents.
We know you two were dating.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.800
We also know donny broke up
with you about a month ago.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.600
–Oh, my God.
–It gives you motive, amanda.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.600
It's not what happened!

31:31.700 --> 31:33.500
Yes, donny broke up with me,

31:34.100 --> 31:37.100
But only because he found out
I hooked up with brandon.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.900
Brandon?

31:39.400 --> 31:41.000
Everything with his family…

31:42.100 --> 31:43.600
Donny checked out.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.600
He wasn't there for me,
and brandon was.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.800
I bet he was.

31:47.700 --> 31:50.400
It's not like that.
Brandon's a really good guy.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.000
A good guy who kept the only copy
of a video he told us you shot.

31:54.100 --> 31:57.600
If brandon kept the video, he had his reasons.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.100
Brandon told you to shoot
the video that night, didn't he?

32:09.200 --> 32:10.100
Yeah.

32:25.600 --> 32:27.400
Guess who just changed his story?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
Your buddy spencer.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.800
Your comrade just gave up
your alibi for max's murder.

32:32.100 --> 32:34.200
You mean max's suicide,
don't you?

32:34.700 --> 32:37.000
And last I checked, I wouldn't
need an alibi for that, would I?

32:37.100 --> 32:40.500
The medical examiner concluded
that max's death was a homicide.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.900
Oh. Well, I'm sure there are
any number of experts

32:43.900 --> 32:46.800
We can hire who will disagree
with a city employee.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.800
Expert witnesses? Scrambling for alibis?

32:49.800 --> 32:51.200
Sounds like you're already building a defense.

32:51.200 --> 32:53.800
You guys have been running
around accusing everyone of murder.

32:54.100 --> 32:57.900
I figured my turn was coming, and I'd better
be ready. Only now we know it was you.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.200
All three of your friends have solid
alibis for the night max was killed.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.900
You say killed, I say suicide.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.200
–Where were you that night?
–I took a walk.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.800
I knew you guys wouldn't believe me,
So I asked spencer to cover for me.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.600
That's what you guys do, right,
cover for each other?

33:10.600 --> 33:12.100
Exactly.

33:13.700 --> 33:17.100
Look, detective,
you're hot and everything,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.700
But if you had any actual evidence,
You'd have already arrested me.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.200
Me?

33:23.800 --> 33:27.500
I have a video that proves max killed donny.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.200
Do you really think a Jury's gonna believe
He didn't get drunk and off himself?

33:31.900 --> 33:33.900
This is just a game
for you, isn't it?

33:34.900 --> 33:36.700
Like selling drugs in the park.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.800
Well, if it was, looks like I'd be winning.

33:40.700 --> 33:44.100
But hey, if you think I did it…

33:45.600 --> 33:46.700
Let's see you prove it.

33:52.500 --> 33:53.900
I hate that kid.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.400
You know, actually having to
prove things is really tedious.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.900
–Welcome to my world.
–Brandon had this all planned.

34:02.300 --> 34:04.900
He gets max to shoot donny then
gets max drunk and kills him.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.100
There's no such thing as
a perfect crime, castle.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.699
Not yet. But one day I'm gonna write it.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.900
Okay, we canvassed every store,

34:12.900 --> 34:16.600
stand and homeless guy from the
park's entrance at 72nd to the scene.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.199
And no one rembers seeing
max or brandon last night.

34:19.699 --> 34:23.199
If we can't put brandon at max's murder
scene, then the d.A. Will never move.

34:23.199 --> 34:25.300
These kids were hooked on video sharing.

34:25.300 --> 34:27.300
–There has to be something.
–Eh, I already scrolled through every video,

34:27.300 --> 34:29.900
audio, photo and text file in that thing.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.800
Guess we weren't lucky enough to have
max take video of brandon killing him.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.900
Funny thing is, if he did,
brandon would have known.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.300
It would have popped up in his shared
folder as soon as their phones…

34:37.300 --> 34:39.000
–synced.
–Thank you.

34:40.100 --> 34:41.400
Synced.

34:41.900 --> 34:43.500
If they were together
when max was murdered,

34:43.500 --> 34:46.100
Then their phones would have automatically
synced. There'd be a record.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.900
You have the right to have
a lawyer present, brandon.

35:00.900 --> 35:04.200
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.000
Oh, he could afford a million lawyers.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.100
But she still has to advise
me of my rights, right?

35:08.100 --> 35:09.100
Right.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.300
Anyway, that's cool.
I don't want a lawyer.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.100
This is way more fun.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.500
Maybe you'd like to just
sign a confession, then?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.000
Sure.

35:25.300 --> 35:26.600
I confess…

35:29.400 --> 35:32.600
That I'm dying to cop a feel
under your cop blouse.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.400
There.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.300
Now I feel so much better.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.800
You sure you don't want to call somebody—

35:44.800 --> 35:46.400
Your parents maybe?

35:46.500 --> 35:47.500
Why would I worry them?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.500
You know, I made a call just
a little while ago to my bookie.

35:50.500 --> 35:51.400
Sweet.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.100
I was standing in the street
outside nobu waiting for my car.

35:54.100 --> 35:57.000
–Oh, yeah? I love that place.
–Their black squid pasta is amazing.

35:57.000 --> 36:00.900
Anyway, I was talking on the phone
When the valet pulled up with my car.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.400
And all of a sudden,
my call got cut off.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.300
And I realized— Oh,
the bluetooth in my car

36:05.300 --> 36:08.900
Picked up the call automatically
because they were linked.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.800
You told us that all your phones autoshare
media files Via bluetooth link, right?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
So?

36:15.300 --> 36:19.000
So your phone linked with max's
phone the night he was killed.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
It's a digital fingerprint that places
youithin 20 feet of max at
the time of his murder.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.500
You did say if she got some actual
evidence, she should arrest you.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.500
You took advantage of max's
guilt over donny's death,

36:29.500 --> 36:31.600
And you got him blackout drunk,

36:31.600 --> 36:33.300
And then you put a gun in his hand,

36:33.500 --> 36:36.700
Pressed it against his temple,
and then you pulled the trigger.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.900
–Why would I do that?
–To cover your tracks over killing donny.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.000
Why would I kill donny?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.400
Amanda.

36:44.700 --> 36:47.600
Amanda is with me, not donny.

36:48.100 --> 36:51.900
–Yeah, only after donny lost all his money.
–Which makes you sloppy seconds.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.000
It had to eat you alive knowing
that amanda had been with donny.

36:55.200 --> 36:58.600
Especially 'cause he got way more
than just under her blouse, right?

37:00.200 --> 37:03.700
I have that video that shows
that max killed donny,

37:05.100 --> 37:06.000
Not me.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.500
And arranging that was very impressive.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.500
Fooling spencer, romy and amanda wasn't
that hard. They didn't handle the gun.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.200
But max was another story.

37:16.300 --> 37:20.000
He actually pulled the trigger,
And he just couldn't let it go, could he?

37:20.500 --> 37:22.400
And then he remembered,
you gave him the gun.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.600
So he called you and asked to meet you.

37:24.700 --> 37:26.300
We have a record of the call.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.200
You knew something was up,

37:28.800 --> 37:31.700
So you brought the gun
and, what, vodka?

37:31.700 --> 37:33.700
Or was max a scotch guy?

37:34.500 --> 37:37.300
He knew all about you,
donny and amanda.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.300
He had to wonder,

37:39.800 --> 37:43.300
“did you set me up to kill my best friend?»

37:44.300 --> 37:46.000
And when he realized you had,

37:47.200 --> 37:49.500
He wasn't gonna keep it quiet, was he?

37:50.000 --> 37:52.700
Even with you telling him,
“you don't go to jail.»

37:54.000 --> 37:58.000
If only max had been strong
enough just to man up…

37:58.800 --> 38:02.600
If only donny realized he didn't
belong with you guys anymore,

38:02.900 --> 38:06.500
He and amanda were through, well, then
none of this would have been necessary.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.800
Weak people just don't get it,

38:10.200 --> 38:11.400
Do they, brandon?

38:14.200 --> 38:16.700
Sometimes they just
have to be led to the truth.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.300
Exactly.

38:23.300 --> 38:24.700
Did he just say “exactly”?

38:24.700 --> 38:28.300
–'Cause I heard him say "exactly.»
–Yeah, I heard it, too.

38:30.600 --> 38:31.900
He tricked me.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.100
You tricked me.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.700
It's called "admission against interest.”

38:35.800 --> 38:38.100
–It's just a fancy term for a confession.
–Pretty sweet, huh?

38:38.100 --> 38:41.300
–Mm-Hmm.
–Oh, and the funny thing is,

38:41.400 --> 38:45.000
I bet you thought you were pretty clever
to go back and move donny's body, right?

38:45.500 --> 38:48.700
But the thing is, is we would
have never figured it out if you hadn't.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.100
Well, shewould have never figured it out.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.700
–Oh, like you would have figured it out.
–I definitely would have figured it out.

38:53.700 --> 38:54.900
Are you kidding me right now?

38:54.900 --> 38:57.200
Honest truth, straight face, from my heart.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.100
Let's go. Power up.
I don't want to be late.

39:21.100 --> 39:21.800
You're coming?

39:21.800 --> 39:24.000
You're looking at the
official replacement chaperone.

39:24.000 --> 39:24.700
Yay!

39:26.100 --> 39:28.400
I just realized I have some business
to take care of in d.C. Anyway.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.000
Really?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.400
Yeah, I gotta pick out a spot
for my monument just in case.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.800
I think Washington and Lincoln
already have the good ones.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.900
–Maybe they can move Jefferson.
–Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

39:35.900 --> 39:39.900
All right, you two kids,
hurry off now.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.800
You don't want to miss any of the fun.

39:46.900 --> 39:49.000
–Any of your fun, you mean?
–It's not what you think.

39:51.400 --> 39:55.400
–Hello, hello. Welcome.
–Welcome. Come in.

39:55.700 --> 39:57.700
No, it'sexactly what I thought.

39:57.700 --> 40:00.400
Now does this look like a wild group?

40:00.400 --> 40:05.200
For your information, I am hosting
a seminar for my life coaching class—

40:05.200 --> 40:07.400
“Be the change you want to see.»

40:07.400 --> 40:10.000
–How very zen of you.
–Dad, come on, be supportive.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.400
–She's trying to help… people.
–Yeah, to my liquor cabinet.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.800
No. This is going to be
a very civilized affair.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.700
Now off, off, off, off.
Have fun!

40:22.400 --> 40:25.800
Okay, who wants a drink?
