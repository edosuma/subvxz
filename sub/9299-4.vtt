00:05.102 --> 00:06.569
<i>Then the doctors told us</i>

00:06.604 --> 00:08.972
<i>that neither of us was a
match for our little boy,</i>

00:09.006 --> 00:12.075
<i>that he would die without
a bone-marrow transplant,</i>

00:12.109 --> 00:14.762
<i>- we were in despair.
- But the best day of our lives</i>

00:14.763 --> 00:18.486
<i>was when an anonymous donor
stepped up and saved our son...</i>

00:18.520 --> 00:20.159
- Don't tell me that was you.
- Funny.

00:20.194 --> 00:21.631
<i>We knew we had to be the
ones to start M.I.L.E.,</i>

00:21.733 --> 00:25.161
<i>a bone-marrow database that
matches strangers through DNA.</i>

00:25.229 --> 00:29.279
<i>But we could only do it with the
help from all of you, so thank you.</i>

00:29.313 --> 00:30.548
[applause]

00:30.616 --> 00:33.687
- All right, let's go.
- Man: Excuse me, waiter.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.030
Sorry. I don't work here.

00:39.369 --> 00:41.574
[chuckling]
I told you to wear a dress.

00:41.642 --> 00:44.513
I only came because you said
the food was gonna be good.

00:44.549 --> 00:45.652
<i>Man #2: Care for some?</i>

00:45.686 --> 00:49.426
Oh, look. More peanuts.
No.

00:49.494 --> 00:52.066
Why did you tell me that
Wolfgang Puck was catering?

00:52.100 --> 00:54.436
Well, he was supposed to.
It was a last-minute decision

00:54.471 --> 00:55.673
to put the money into the charity.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.543
It wouldn't hurt you to be charitable.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.448
I spent eight bucks on
the beer. Does that count?

00:59.515 --> 01:02.286
Can we please get something
that isn't served in coach?

01:02.321 --> 01:05.759
Okay, I'm on the board of directors.
I can't just leave.

01:05.793 --> 01:08.665
- Can I?
- Yeah. Who's gonna know?

01:08.700 --> 01:13.106
- Live dangerously. Come on.
- Tucker: Dr. Isles.

01:13.140 --> 01:14.776
Thank you for all
you've done for M.I.L.E.

01:14.810 --> 01:16.713
Of course. It's an important cause.

01:16.748 --> 01:18.916
This is my colleague,
Detective Jane Rizzoli.

01:18.951 --> 01:22.220
- Thanks for attending our event.
- Yeah, I should thank you

01:22.254 --> 01:24.923
for sinking that putt
on the 18th in the open.

01:24.958 --> 01:28.596
- I won the office pool.
- Golf fan, huh? Do you play?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.432
Well, that's not really a fair question

01:30.466 --> 01:32.870
coming from a pro who
regularly shoots a 61.

01:32.938 --> 01:34.806
Oh, honey, I think it's time for you

01:34.841 --> 01:37.577
to go work your magic
with the platinum table.

01:37.612 --> 01:39.547
<i>Dr. Isles, could I snag you?</i>

01:39.582 --> 01:41.217
Those are all grumpy doctors.

01:41.251 --> 01:43.220
I have a bad feeling they
only came for the food.

01:43.254 --> 01:45.790
- Who would do that?
- I bet they'd open their wallets

01:45.825 --> 01:47.861
if I introduced them to
the chief medical examiner.

01:47.928 --> 01:51.399
I'd be happy to help.
Excuse me.

01:51.433 --> 01:54.771
Dr. Isles made such a generous
donation to M.I.L.E. this year.

01:54.805 --> 01:57.507
Yeah.
Well, that Maura...

01:57.542 --> 01:58.677
she's a giver.

01:58.711 --> 02:01.748
Mm. How about you, Jane?
Are you a giver?

02:03.952 --> 02:05.687
What?

02:09.359 --> 02:12.295
Would you excuse us?
Can I borrow you for a second, please?

02:12.330 --> 02:13.296
Excuse me.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.638
- What is the matter?
- What's the matter?

02:19.673 --> 02:21.725
If we don't get out of
here, Taylor Franklin is

02:21.726 --> 02:23.777
gonna help herself to what's
left of my bank account.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.312
Well, how much money did you give her?

02:25.346 --> 02:28.315
A thousand bucks.
And she wants more.

02:28.383 --> 02:31.586
- Just say no.
- I don't want to appear cheap.

02:32.722 --> 02:34.256
Oh, no. Here she comes.
Please, can we go?

02:34.291 --> 02:36.025
Oh, no. Come on. I'm
having such a nice time.

02:36.059 --> 02:40.830
- Can't you just, like, mingle?
- When have you ever seen me mingle?

02:40.865 --> 02:44.435
- Can I get some more peanuts?
- We ran out.

02:45.305 --> 02:47.939
Well, let me at least introduce you.

02:47.973 --> 02:51.677
Brad is a charming conversationalist,
a post-modern art aficionado,

02:51.711 --> 02:54.012
and a prominent colorectal surgeon.

02:54.047 --> 02:57.817
Wow, I never thought I'd hear
the words "charming" and "rectal"

02:57.851 --> 03:00.821
- used in the same sentence.
- Oh, stop. Come on. Just join us.

03:00.888 --> 03:03.891
No, and listen to a butt doctor
talk about art on an empty stomach?

03:03.926 --> 03:08.631
- No. It's okay. I'm leaving.
- Okay. Here. Just take my car.

03:08.665 --> 03:10.700
- You sure?
- Yes. I'll catch a cab.

03:13.639 --> 03:14.906
No, I think you'll get a ride home.

I can't believe you've
seen Hung Liu's work.

03:41.737 --> 03:44.873
[chuckles] Of course.
The ... the way she addresses

03:44.940 --> 03:48.844
issues of identity,
marginality, sexism, and racism

03:48.878 --> 03:51.580
is ... is awe-inspiring.

03:51.614 --> 03:53.916
It is so refreshing to
hear a man talk like this.

03:53.950 --> 03:55.952
You know, female artists
are so marginalized.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.489
God, I-I could talk to you all night.

03:58.523 --> 04:01.059
I could talk to you, too.

04:02.762 --> 04:07.333
Oh, it's late. Uh, I should go.
I-it's a school night.

04:07.367 --> 04:08.934

Oh.
A Chateau de la Valence.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.708
That's ... that's one of my favorites.
I'm gonna regret this tomorrow.

04:15.776 --> 04:20.480
- What's tomorrow?
- Whatever the coroner's van drags in,

04:20.515 --> 04:24.450
blood work to be reviewed,
two trials to prep for.

04:24.484 --> 04:25.785
<i>Thank you.</i>

04:25.819 --> 04:27.954
I'm also hoping to start
the identification process

04:27.988 --> 04:30.890
on some human remains we
discovered at a construction site.

04:30.925 --> 04:35.361
Oh, I did a rotation in forensic
anthropology. I found it fascinating.

04:35.396 --> 04:37.797
Yeah, we've been waiting
for all the bones to come in

04:37.832 --> 04:39.833
to make sure we're only
dealing with one victim.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.769
- So, it's a homicide?
- Open case.

04:42.803 --> 04:46.139
- I really can't talk about it.
- I'm sorry.

04:46.173 --> 04:48.541
Tell me about your work.
[chuckles]

04:48.575 --> 04:51.378
No, e-even I don't want
to talk about my work.

04:51.412 --> 04:53.546
Yours is a lot more interesting.

04:53.581 --> 04:57.016
- Well, cheers to that.
- Cheers.

<i>- Salud.

<i>I still think you're
wrong about Cindy Sherman.</i>

05:00.921 --> 05:04.724

05:04.758 --> 05:07.593

I find it so hard to believe

05:08.928 --> 05:10.729
that you know so much
about female artists.

05:10.763 --> 05:12.164
The female that I'd ...

05:12.198 --> 05:14.399
I'd really like to
know more about is you.

05:14.433 --> 05:16.167

Oh, no, no. There's no way
I'm letting you take a cab.

05:17.936 --> 05:20.638
Come on. I'm just parked
around the corner. Come on.

05:22.108 --> 05:23.842
I don't trust valets.
[chuckles]

05:23.877 --> 05:28.480
- I don't. Come on.
- Thank you.

<i>Jane: Maura! [door closes]
Hey, Maura!</i>

05:35.855 --> 05:37.856
Where's Maura?
We've got a homicide.

05:37.924 --> 05:39.925
She's not answering her
phone. I have her car.

05:39.959 --> 05:43.862
- What's happening?
- Oh, she got home late ... around 5:00 A.M.

05:45.565 --> 05:48.934
Are you working on this case?
So grisly.

05:48.968 --> 05:51.636
They found bones at the new mall site.

05:51.671 --> 05:55.706
Too bad. I wanted to shop there.
Check this out.

05:55.741 --> 05:57.675
[exhaling sharply]

05:58.810 --> 06:00.477
What are you doing?

06:00.511 --> 06:04.248
Maura and I have been
watching self-defense videos.

06:04.282 --> 06:06.617
Ooh, I feel so empowered!

06:06.651 --> 06:09.787
[grunting] I can see why.
You're so good at it.

06:09.821 --> 06:11.155
[cellphone dialing]

06:11.222 --> 06:13.624
[laughing] Maybe she
went to get some coffee.

06:13.658 --> 06:16.626
[cellphone buzzing]

06:21.666 --> 06:23.233
Maura.

06:25.169 --> 06:26.937
[cellphone beeps]

06:30.007 --> 06:33.976
- Hello?
- Hey, Maura. Did I wake you?

06:34.011 --> 06:38.247
Uh... well, let me see.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.653
I'm talking to you on the phone.

06:44.688 --> 06:49.025
Yeah. [chuckles]
What happened last night?

06:49.093 --> 06:50.861
[sighs]

06:50.895 --> 06:53.164
I don't know.

06:53.231 --> 06:56.534
I don't know, 
but my head is killing me.

06:56.602 --> 07:00.638
That's it? What ... there's
no scientific explanation

07:00.672 --> 07:03.574
for the common hangover?
No lobes? No craniums?

07:03.642 --> 07:06.010
No dehydration?
 What, nothing?

07:08.113 --> 07:09.981
Ma, can you get her a cup of coffee?

07:10.015 --> 07:12.616
Are you okay?

07:17.055 --> 07:21.158
[sirens wail, police radio chatter]

07:21.192 --> 07:23.961
Ugh.
That is ugly.

07:23.995 --> 07:26.163
<i>Oh, come on. 
He's not even bleeding.</i>

07:26.198 --> 07:29.867
- I meant the car.
- There are those that consider

07:29.968 --> 07:31.569
the Chevrolet citation a classic.

07:31.637 --> 07:34.205
[laughs]
Yeah, a classic mistake.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.309
It's one of the 50 worst cars ever made.

07:38.644 --> 07:43.081
- Which means you owned one.
- Yeah. So?

07:43.149 --> 07:46.986
That car required more
maintenance than any of my wives.

07:49.055 --> 07:51.891
Dr. Isles is wearing what she
had on when she left last night.

07:51.925 --> 07:54.726
You can wear the same thing
if it's to the walk of shame.

07:54.827 --> 07:55.827
Hey, watch yourself.

07:55.862 --> 07:59.063
- All right, what have we got?
- Adult male, mid to late 30s.

07:59.098 --> 08:00.732
Meter maid 
found him around 7:00 A.M.

08:00.766 --> 08:04.135
Keys are still in the ignition.
No drag marks outside the vehicle.

08:04.169 --> 08:05.871
Oh, so, he was killed inside the car.

08:05.905 --> 08:07.873
It looks like he was
punched in the throat.

08:07.907 --> 08:12.778
- Maura, what do you think?
- Uh, is it bright out here?

08:14.781 --> 08:16.282
Uh, did you guys get an I.D.?

08:16.383 --> 08:17.383
- Not yet.
- No.

08:17.417 --> 08:22.255
I ran the plates. Car's registered
to a Dorothy MacAllister, deceased.

08:22.289 --> 08:25.258
Her son sold the car for cash
last week and didn't get a name.

08:25.292 --> 08:27.026
Open bar at the charity
event last night?

08:27.061 --> 08:29.195
I have no idea.

08:30.032 --> 08:32.667
Body's not in full rigor.

08:32.775 --> 08:36.303
Time of death within
the last eight hours.

08:36.370 --> 08:38.071
[gasps]

08:39.707 --> 08:44.277
- Maura, what is it?
- There's a lot of bruising right there.

08:44.379 --> 08:48.280
- Oh, is that the guy from last night?
- Yeah.

08:50.848 --> 08:52.648
When's the last time you saw him?

08:52.682 --> 08:56.316
- Uh...
- Jane...

08:58.353 --> 09:01.922
Maura, what is your I.D. badge
doing in the victim's car?

09:04.659 --> 09:07.193
I don't know.

09:17.523 --> 09:19.992
[sirens wail, police radio chatter]

09:20.026 --> 09:22.730
<i>Jane: How do we keep this from
becoming a media feeding frenzy?</i>

09:22.764 --> 09:24.165
Paddy Doyle's trial is next week.

09:24.199 --> 09:26.601
If I didn't know Dr. Isles,
 I'd rush to judgment.

09:26.669 --> 09:28.069
"Mob boss's daughter kills her date."

09:28.104 --> 09:31.873
But we know Dr. Isles didn't do it,
so maybe someone set her up.

09:31.908 --> 09:34.909
It wouldn't be that hard to steal
her I.D. card, put it in his car.

09:34.944 --> 09:37.646
Okay, here's what I need to know.
Does she have an alibi?

09:37.680 --> 09:40.215
She can't account for her
whereabouts from 1:00 to 5:00 A.M.

09:40.250 --> 09:43.618
But what about witnesses?
Did anyone see them together?

09:43.653 --> 09:47.622
Yeah, I saw them together, and
so did everybody at that benefit.

09:47.690 --> 09:48.856
Korsak: We've held off talking to them.

09:48.891 --> 09:51.625
- Why's that?
- Because it's Dr. Isles, Sean.

09:51.693 --> 09:54.762
- What's she say happened?
- She can't remember anything.

09:56.665 --> 09:59.700
Okay. This is as bad as it gets.

09:59.768 --> 10:01.569
We've got to bring
her in for questioning.

10:01.603 --> 10:02.736
- What?
- How can we investigate her?

10:02.771 --> 10:03.771
We work with her.

10:03.805 --> 10:06.740
Every cop in Massachusetts
has worked with her at some point.

10:06.775 --> 10:10.043
- Right now, it's our investigation.
- But what about the autopsy?

10:10.078 --> 10:14.615
Well, the Governor assigned that, uh...
Dr. Vladimir Popov to the case.

10:14.649 --> 10:17.184
Popov can't find his own ass
unless you put his hand on it.

10:17.218 --> 10:19.720
<i>[cellphone rings]
 I know.</i>

10:19.754 --> 10:21.989
Well, get ready.

10:22.057 --> 10:25.059
This is gonna be worse than
you shooting Paddy Doyle.

10:25.094 --> 10:28.497
<i>Yeah, Governor.
Yes, I can hear you, sir.</i>

10:28.531 --> 10:31.199
- I don't know what to do.
- We've got to do our job, Jane.

10:44.212 --> 10:45.646
Do we have to do this right now?

10:45.680 --> 10:47.548
Look at her. Something's off.

10:47.582 --> 10:51.051
No, she was out of it this morning,
like someone else was in her body.

10:51.119 --> 10:55.190
- Is she a drinker?
- No. I mean, wine.

10:55.224 --> 10:57.025
- Maybe somebody slipped a roofie.
- Yeah.

10:57.059 --> 10:58.526
Yeah. The victim was a doctor.

10:58.594 --> 11:00.695
Take a tox screen
after you interview her.

11:00.729 --> 11:02.097
Why after? 
Why not do it now?

11:02.131 --> 11:03.965
We have to treat her like anybody else.

11:05.234 --> 11:07.269
<i>I don't like this any
better than you do.</i>

11:07.303 --> 11:09.204
<i>We should probably
should do a rape kit, too.</i>

11:09.238 --> 11:12.674
- Oh, my god.
- Jane, you want me to do the interview?

11:12.708 --> 11:16.778
- No. I'll do it.
- Rizzoli, you can't go in there

11:16.812 --> 11:18.846
unless you're gonna go at
her like any other suspect.

11:18.914 --> 11:22.917
- I can do that.
- Okay. [door opens]

11:24.553 --> 11:26.087
I just ran a background
check on Brad Adams.

11:26.121 --> 11:27.842
You got to see this.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.686
[music]

11:40.136 --> 11:42.171
Did Brad Adams tell you
what he did for a living?

11:42.205 --> 11:44.573
Yes, I told you, Jane.

11:46.309 --> 11:49.844
<i>- He was a colorectal surgeon.
- What did you talk about?</i>

11:49.879 --> 11:53.080

11:53.148 --> 11:54.615
<i> [sighs ]</i>

11:54.650 --> 11:57.151
<i>He ordered one of my favorite wines.</i>

11:57.186 --> 11:59.921
Did you leave the
M.I.L.E. benefit with him?

11:59.955 --> 12:02.223
- Yes.
- How did you get home?

12:02.258 --> 12:06.061
I, uh...
I wanted to take a cab.

12:06.095 --> 12:07.596
Check the taxi companies.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.197
- See if there's any record.
- Okay.

12:09.231 --> 12:11.800
How did your I.D. get
in the victim's car?

12:11.834 --> 12:14.636
I'm not sure.

12:14.670 --> 12:17.238
Um...

12:18.307 --> 12:22.176
I remember walking past
the valet, and then...

12:22.210 --> 12:26.180
Did he kiss me? I ...
I think he blew me a kiss.

12:26.214 --> 12:28.048
He blew you a kiss?

12:30.084 --> 12:31.919
Do you remember anything after that?

12:31.953 --> 12:34.155
[voice breaking]
Oh, no.

12:36.325 --> 12:38.092
I was in his car.

12:38.126 --> 12:41.095
She just put herself
at the murder scene.

12:41.163 --> 12:43.030
<i>Maura: Oh, no.</i>

12:46.936 --> 12:48.837
[sighs]

12:48.871 --> 12:52.006
Brad Adams had a record of
theft and drug possession.

12:52.041 --> 12:56.144
He owed $39,000 in back child support,
and he wasn't a doctor.

12:56.178 --> 12:59.314
- He was a bouncer at a night club.
- Oh, god.

12:59.348 --> 13:02.716
- He played her.
- The question is why.

13:02.751 --> 13:05.319
It's getting hot in here.

13:06.821 --> 13:11.391
- Oh, god.
- Where did you get those bruises?

13:15.095 --> 13:17.397
[sighs]

13:17.431 --> 13:19.766
Multiple hematomas.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.902
<i>Likely offensive in nature
due to the location on the arm.</i>

13:22.937 --> 13:27.073
This type of bruising
would occur if I ...

13:27.107 --> 13:30.710
I threw a punch and it was
blocked by someone's arm.

13:33.147 --> 13:36.215
Dr. Isles, are you saying
that you attacked Brad Adams?

13:36.550 --> 13:40.787
I...
I don't know. Maybe.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.189
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

13:43.224 --> 13:46.026
I was provoked?

13:50.698 --> 13:54.035
Research indicates that
even the most docile human

13:54.102 --> 13:57.037
is capable of murder in the
right set of circumstances.

13:59.141 --> 14:00.708
[door closes]

14:00.776 --> 14:02.843
Now what the hell do we do?

14:02.878 --> 14:06.813
We take pictures and
process her clothes.

14:06.881 --> 14:09.717
Do you think that's the right call?

14:09.751 --> 14:14.988
We don't have a choice.
Better us than anybody else.

14:15.023 --> 14:18.125

- You're just doing your job, Susie.</i>

14:27.536 --> 14:29.203
We're gonna need your underwear, too.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.975
You know, I have processed
hundreds of suspects,

14:34.009 --> 14:38.413
but I never truly understood
how humiliating this is.

14:43.419 --> 14:45.087
[door closes] 
I'm so sorry, Maura.

14:45.121 --> 14:48.924
- Don't be. You didn't do it.
- You didn't, either.

14:51.028 --> 14:53.395
Maybe I did.

14:55.531 --> 14:59.767
I've got a-a void in my brain
where there should be a memory,

14:59.802 --> 15:02.503
and I've certainly experienced
the kind of rage it would take

15:02.538 --> 15:05.773
- to inflict that kind of an injury.
- Just don't say anything else, okay?

15:07.576 --> 15:09.243
<i>Dr. Maura Isles, of course,</i>

15:31.965 --> 15:35.434
What do we know about our victim,
the phony colorectal doctor?

15:35.536 --> 15:38.104
Well... we know he was a real asshole.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.143
And he was also a thief,
a drug dealer, and a predator.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.046
- So he had enemies.
- Here's something.

15:47.081 --> 15:49.282
He had a pretty
pissed-off ex-wife.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.317
She wasn't getting a
penny of the $39,000

15:51.351 --> 15:52.952
he owed her in child support.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.087
She'd at least get social
security if he was dead.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.256
Let's bring her in for a chat.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.791
[elevator bell dings]

16:01.962 --> 16:03.963
- How's Maura?
-  Terrible.

16:03.997 --> 16:07.066
- How are you?
- Not as bad as Maura.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.934
- What can I do?
- Just help her.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.172
Talk to everybody that
Brad Adams knew ...

16:14.541 --> 16:16.575
everybody that he
worked with at the club.

16:16.610 --> 16:19.245
Okay, Martinez cleared it because
he's got a history of drug arrests.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.413
You got it.

16:22.450 --> 16:25.118
Hey, wait. Check on Ma first.
Make sure she's okay.

16:26.521 --> 16:29.289
[elevator bell dings]

16:29.323 --> 16:31.291
Can you guys give us a minute, please?

16:33.227 --> 16:34.427
You want me to call your lawyer?

16:36.163 --> 16:39.399
- You want me to call your parents?
- No.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.135
You know they got to take
you to the hospital for this.

16:42.169 --> 16:46.372
Yeah, I know. For the rape kit.
I know the drill.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.575
Look, just ... 
just do your job, Jane.

17:51.959 --> 17:54.227
Susie, I know you're not
supposed to say anything,

17:54.261 --> 17:57.230
but could you tell me
something about the dead man?

17:57.265 --> 18:00.066
No. We have to wait until
Dr. Popov does the autopsy.

18:00.134 --> 18:01.034
- Wait ...
- And he's not here ...

18:01.068 --> 18:03.136
Dr. Popov?

18:03.171 --> 18:07.641

of vodka and calls me "girl"?

18:07.676 --> 18:10.745
Oh, boy.
Maura's really in trouble now.

18:10.812 --> 18:15.650
I looked... and if I were
a guesser, which I'm not,

18:15.684 --> 18:18.086
I'd say that the cause of death was...

18:18.120 --> 18:20.088
asphyxiation due to a crushed trachea.

18:20.122 --> 18:24.692
If I'm right, it was caused by a
direct, powerful punch to the throat.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.261
Whoever did this knew
what they were doing.

18:27.763 --> 18:32.667
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:32.702 --> 18:38.206

18:50.787 --> 18:54.122
That's kind of funny, right?
Pickled Popov.

18:54.190 --> 18:56.324
Maura, you can't be here. You
can't be working this case.

18:56.392 --> 18:59.328
- Well, am I under arrest?
- No.

18:59.362 --> 19:01.063
Is my tox screen back?

19:01.130 --> 19:03.031
Not yet. Why? Do you
think you were drugged?

19:03.066 --> 19:06.368
I had a lot of wine.
Who knows?

19:06.402 --> 19:08.871
What did the hospital say?

19:08.905 --> 19:12.308
- There's no evidence of sexual assault.
- Good.

19:12.342 --> 19:14.877
At least I could've
claimed self-defense.

19:14.911 --> 19:16.612
Have you remembered something?

19:16.680 --> 19:19.181
No. No.
It's just I have done too much reading

19:19.249 --> 19:22.251

In the presence of a threat,

19:22.285 --> 19:23.686

the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
to the midbrain periaqueductal gray.

19:27.824 --> 19:31.894
I have no idea what that means,
and for once, I don't want to know.

- A therapist, huh?

"Vivian's hot hands.
Come in for your happy ending."

20:15.740 --> 20:17.807

- That's a lot of free happy endings.

20:42.132 --> 20:43.332
She's not cooperating.

20:43.367 --> 20:46.068
We'll have to do a lot of digging
to come up with a client list.

In the mean time, what
do we do with 50 people

20:47.271 --> 20:48.738

20:48.806 --> 20:50.473

[buzzer, lock clicks]

24:01.427 --> 24:03.528
I know you.

24:03.563 --> 24:05.397
You're the bitch that
put my old man away.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.934
No, that wasn't me.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.871
Yeah, it was.
I've seen you before.

24:11.905 --> 24:14.541
Many studies have indicated
that eyewitness identifications

24:14.608 --> 24:16.510
can be wrong in up to 35% of cases

24:16.544 --> 24:18.812
when you account for lighting,
distance, and visual acuity.

24:18.846 --> 24:20.480
You even sound like a cop.

24:20.515 --> 24:22.282
Actually, I am the
chief medical examiner

24:22.316 --> 24:23.483
for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

24:23.551 --> 24:25.986
She's a cop.

24:26.020 --> 24:28.522
- I'm not a cop.
- Looks like this little bird

24:28.556 --> 24:30.691
picked the wrong place to land.

24:30.725 --> 24:32.426
[indistinct shouting] 
Oh!

24:32.460 --> 24:33.994
Mary Pat: Get off her, Gomez!

24:34.028 --> 24:35.529
Get off me! Get off me!

24:35.563 --> 24:36.530
Get off!

24:38.266 --> 24:39.934
You're getting two chits for that.

24:40.001 --> 24:41.636
[door closes, buzzer]

24:41.670 --> 24:44.272
- You okay?
- Thanks.

24:44.306 --> 24:45.373
You need medical attention?

24:45.407 --> 24:48.643
- Could I get some ice?
- You got it.

24:51.814 --> 24:54.249
Paddy Doyle sends his regards.

24:54.283 --> 24:58.888
- What?
- I'll get 'em to bring that ice.

24:58.922 --> 25:02.391
You need anything else, you
ask for Mary Pat, you hear?

25:07.797 --> 25:09.932
[buzzer, door opens]

25:12.001 --> 25:15.337
<i>Olives and ketchup?</i>

25:15.371 --> 25:17.372
You're not really
gonna eat that, are you?

25:17.407 --> 25:19.508
Well, it's moldy cheese or this.

25:19.543 --> 25:22.411
- What do you got on Brad Adams?
- Local boy.

25:22.446 --> 25:24.413
He's been working as a
bouncer for the last 

25:24.448 --> 25:26.682
- few years all over town.
- Mm-hmm.

25:26.717 --> 25:30.520
He was employed at a high-end club,
Hollow Venom, for about a year.

25:30.554 --> 25:31.954
Yeah, yeah. A lot of
celebrities go there.

25:31.989 --> 25:35.024
Well, word is he was the
hook-up for drugs and women.

25:35.058 --> 25:37.059
Ivy-league dropout.

25:37.093 --> 25:39.061
Life fell apart when he
developed a drug habit.

25:39.095 --> 25:42.765
Smart con man.
That explains how he managed

25:42.799 --> 25:44.266
to convince Maura he was a doctor.

25:44.334 --> 25:45.501
[knock on door]

25:47.537 --> 25:49.404
I can go 
if you're expecting someone.

25:49.472 --> 25:51.807
Oh, yeah, I've got a real
romantic evening planned

25:51.874 --> 25:53.375
while my best friend spends the night

25:53.409 --> 25:56.344
avoiding the showers
in a women's prison.

26:01.817 --> 26:03.551
May I come in?

26:05.755 --> 26:10.425
- Come on, Jane.
- What? I'm not stopping her.

26:12.762 --> 26:15.831
All right, I'm sick
about what happened today.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.666
Yeah, me, too. W-why would
you give that to Cavanaugh?

26:18.734 --> 26:20.034
Because I couldn't give it to you.

26:20.069 --> 26:23.505
- Why not, Ma?
- Jane. Be real.

26:23.539 --> 26:25.540
You've got her hair and
fingerprints in his car,

26:25.574 --> 26:27.742
his skin under her nails. It...

26:29.612 --> 26:32.413
It's not Ma's fault she's in jail.

26:32.448 --> 26:34.649
Why would you go to your
boyfriend instead of me?

26:34.683 --> 26:38.486
I was protecting you.
I didn't want to put you in a position

26:38.521 --> 26:40.522
where you had to decide
what to do with that video.

26:40.556 --> 26:42.757
I know what I would've done with
that video. I would've deleted it.

26:42.825 --> 26:45.660
Oh, Jane, the cop in you
would hate yourself if you did that.

26:45.695 --> 26:47.796
And you'd be charged with
obstruction of justice.

26:47.830 --> 26:50.699
Most I'd get is a year in jail.

26:52.803 --> 26:55.259
Maura's looking at life.

27:06.884 --> 27:09.887
[buzzer, door opens]

27:09.954 --> 27:11.789
- Gomez, let's go.
- You letting me out?

27:11.823 --> 27:13.958
I'm escorting you to isolation.

27:15.894 --> 27:18.396
I'll be back.

27:20.031 --> 27:21.799
[horn blares]

27:21.833 --> 27:23.100
<i>Brad: [distorted] No way
I'm letting you take a cab.</i>

27:23.135 --> 27:24.802
<i>I'm just parked right around the corner.</i>

27:26.604 --> 27:28.205
[buzzer]

27:32.877 --> 27:35.880
[buzzer, door opens]

27:35.914 --> 27:38.082
What ...
what happened to your face?

27:38.116 --> 27:40.518
I need you to get Susie
to do another tox screen.

27:41.553 --> 27:44.488
Excuse me.
Attention, all inmates.

27:44.522 --> 27:46.557
Whoever did this to my friend's face

27:46.591 --> 27:48.492
will have to look over her
shoulder for the rest of her life,

27:48.526 --> 27:52.162
and if it happens again,
it will be a very, very short life.

27:52.197 --> 27:53.664
Okay, Jane, please.

27:53.698 --> 27:55.098
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to embarrass you

27:55.133 --> 27:56.766
in front of all your new friends.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.635
- Okay, the tox screen ...
- Yes.

27:58.702 --> 28:00.003
- We did it. You were clean
- No, no, no.

28:00.037 --> 28:02.072
She has to do a specific screen

28:02.106 --> 28:04.073
- for Scopolamine.
- Scopolamine?

28:04.108 --> 28:06.576
Remember how I said I
thought he blew me a kiss?

28:06.610 --> 28:08.644
- Yeah.
- Scopolamine is also called

28:08.678 --> 28:10.112
"the devil's breath" ...
it can be administered

28:10.146 --> 28:14.482
- by blowing it in someone's face.
- Well, that could explain a lot of this.

28:14.517 --> 28:18.754
- Yeah, what explains this?
- You probably tried to get away.

28:20.022 --> 28:23.958
- Which one hit you?
- It's not gonna happen again.

28:23.992 --> 28:25.793
Oh, yes, I'm sure it was
just a misunderstanding.

28:25.828 --> 28:27.061
Did you borrow someone's shank?

28:27.095 --> 28:30.129
It's okay. Paddy put the word out.

28:32.066 --> 28:33.633
That's not good, Maura.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.902
Anyone that wants to hurt
Paddy will go after you.

28:37.738 --> 28:40.907
Oh, god.
Just get me out of here, Jane.

28:40.941 --> 28:43.142
Look, anybody comes close to you, okay,

28:43.177 --> 28:45.478
you just go with your
elbow right to the throat,

28:45.513 --> 28:47.046
all right?

28:47.081 --> 28:49.449
Just stay alive.

28:49.516 --> 28:52.685
[buzzer, door opens and closes]

28:54.722 --> 28:56.156
Jane: Thank you. 
Did I get you out of bed?

28:56.190 --> 28:57.824
No, I couldn't sleep,

28:57.858 --> 28:59.826
But I think you pulled lover-boy
from between the sheets.

28:59.860 --> 29:03.229
- Hot date?
- Not anymore.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.131
How soon before we find
out if it was Scopolamine?

29:05.165 --> 29:07.000
Susie's on it, but she said
it's gonna take a few hours.

29:07.067 --> 29:08.968
It's a street drug from South America.

29:09.002 --> 29:10.837
And it says here it
turns you into a zombie.

29:10.905 --> 29:12.472
Knew a guy who got dosed
with it in Colombia.

29:12.540 --> 29:15.575
Dumb place to vacation, if you ask me.
The second you're hit with it,

29:15.643 --> 29:17.010
you do anything anyone tells
you and not remember doing it.

29:17.044 --> 29:18.645
He gave up his ATM code.

29:18.679 --> 29:21.514
Yeah, it's sometimes
used as a date-rape drug,

29:21.549 --> 29:23.082
but Maura wasn't raped.

29:23.150 --> 29:25.718
Do you think Brad used it on her
to get into her bank accounts?

29:25.752 --> 29:27.920
Even if he did, somebody
still had to kill him.

29:27.954 --> 29:29.788
You think he had an accomplice?

29:29.823 --> 29:31.790
Maybe. 
Did you check Brad's financials?

29:31.824 --> 29:34.159
[clicking]
 [computer beeps]

29:34.193 --> 29:35.927
His bank balance was pretty low.

29:35.962 --> 29:39.531
What have we here?
A deposit for $9,500.

29:39.598 --> 29:41.499
The week before the charity event?

29:41.534 --> 29:45.136
He knew the kind of art she liked,
her favorite wine.

29:45.171 --> 29:46.772
Maura doesn't even have a facebook page.

29:46.806 --> 29:47.873
[computer beeps]

29:47.907 --> 29:51.143
But she does have an interview
in "La femme vivant" monthly.

29:51.177 --> 29:54.046
This is a big profile.
It's all there ...

29:54.080 --> 29:56.949
the wine, the art,
details about her job.

29:56.983 --> 29:59.818
He did play her.
He went to that benefit to find her.

29:59.886 --> 30:02.287
And 9,500 bucks in cash
tells me he was paid to do it.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.189
And then he got killed for his trouble.

30:04.257 --> 30:05.757
Korsak, you said this drug

30:05.791 --> 30:07.225
will make you do anything
you're told to do?

30:08.327 --> 30:10.195
Frost, check her bank accounts,

30:10.230 --> 30:12.698
and if he wasn't after her money,
what was he after?

30:14.601 --> 30:16.068
<i>We have a theory.</i>

30:16.136 --> 30:18.938
<i>So, he gave her some zombie
drug so he could rob her,</i>

30:18.973 --> 30:20.240
<i>then wiped out her bank account?</i>

30:20.274 --> 30:21.875
As far as we can tell,
he didn't take anything.

30:21.909 --> 30:25.712
So, if he didn't rob her or
sexually assault her, what did he do?

30:25.746 --> 30:27.947
Well, we think he was
after her I.D. card.

30:27.981 --> 30:32.652
Dr. Isles' card was swiped to
enter the M.E.'s office at 2:04 A.M.

30:33.954 --> 30:35.955
Well, good. Let's get the video.

30:35.989 --> 30:39.192
- There isn't any.
- There isn't any?

30:39.226 --> 30:40.960
Dr. Isles was under the
influence of the drug,

30:41.028 --> 30:42.929
which means she might have told
him how to avoid the cameras.

30:42.963 --> 30:45.031
You can take the funeral-parlor
ramp. No cameras there.

30:45.066 --> 30:47.100
Yeah, but you don't break into a
place unless you want something,

30:47.167 --> 30:50.737
- So what did he take?
- We haven't found anything missing... yet.

30:50.771 --> 30:51.971
But you have prints?

30:53.907 --> 30:55.641
We think he was wearing gloves.

30:59.747 --> 31:03.583
So, you don't have a theory.
You've got wishful thinking.

31:11.284 --> 31:13.185
You're sure there's nothing gone?

31:13.220 --> 31:15.221
We double-checked the inventory
in here and in the autopsy room.

31:15.255 --> 31:16.689
Nothing's missing.

31:16.723 --> 31:18.024
Susie even checked the cold storage.

31:18.058 --> 31:20.860
All the forensic specimens,
all the bodies are accounted for.

31:20.894 --> 31:22.562
Well, he was looking for
something. What was it?

31:24.065 --> 31:25.799
What about the bone room?
Did anybody check that?

31:25.833 --> 31:27.634
We hardly ever go in there,

31:27.669 --> 31:31.138
but Dr. Isles leaves
the key right over here.

31:39.381 --> 31:43.652
- You ever been in here?
- Once. Keypad's new.

31:43.686 --> 31:47.756
- Dr. Isles gave me the combination.
- Wait a minute. Don't touch that.

31:49.225 --> 31:51.661
That's a heat-activated touch screen.

31:51.695 --> 31:53.930
If Brad wanted to get in,
he'd have to remove his gloves.

31:53.997 --> 31:56.165
I might be able to lift a print.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.201
<i>Frost: 405, skull and femur
of a teenage John Doe.</i>

31:59.269 --> 32:02.571
- It's here.
- I'll check the inventory.

32:02.606 --> 32:05.007
- Got it.
- Korsak: I got it, too.

32:07.244 --> 32:08.844
Looks like a right index finger.

32:08.879 --> 32:10.146
Oh, Korsak, that's great.

32:10.180 --> 32:12.314
- I'll get it to latent prints.
- Okay.

32:12.348 --> 32:16.685
- Uh, 1204.
- Partial adult female skull.

32:16.719 --> 32:20.723
Okay.
1304... is empty.

32:20.757 --> 32:21.790
Is it supposed to be empty?

32:25.028 --> 32:27.829
- No.
- What's supposed to be in it?

32:27.863 --> 32:29.631
Bones that were discovered
at the Stonehaven mall site.

32:29.665 --> 32:31.166
They were in that drawer?

32:31.234 --> 32:33.635
Well, I couldn't begin the
forensic identification process

32:33.670 --> 32:34.970
until all the recovery was complete,

32:35.038 --> 32:36.906
But I had a near-complete skeleton.

32:36.940 --> 32:38.841
<i>So, what can you tell
us about those bones?</i>

32:38.875 --> 32:40.976
[sighs] I-I'd be guessing.

32:41.011 --> 32:44.147
<i>Oh, okay.
Never mind. Have fun in prison.</i>

32:44.214 --> 32:45.648
<i>Tell Paddy I said "hi."</i>

32:45.683 --> 32:48.251
Be happy to pass that along.

32:49.787 --> 32:51.788
Oh, I hate doing this.

32:51.822 --> 32:55.025
Uh... she was was a female in her 20s.

32:55.059 --> 32:57.661
Okay, start checking the
NCIC missing-persons database.

32:57.695 --> 33:01.799
- Frost: It's not much to go on.
- Uh, Maura, what about height?

33:01.833 --> 33:04.636
<i>I didn't have enough of
the femur or rib cage yet.</i>

33:04.704 --> 33:08.774
- So, between 5 and 6 feet?
- Yes, I think I could agree with that.

33:08.808 --> 33:12.411
<i>Oh, that's a big help.
You sure it wasn't between 4 and 7 feet?</i>

33:12.445 --> 33:15.681
- 7 feet?
- Let's make her 5'6".

33:15.749 --> 33:17.416
<i>Okay, you know, I
know what you're doing.</i>

33:17.484 --> 33:19.818
You're gonna say that
she was just 300 pounds

33:19.886 --> 33:23.389
so I could say, no, she was
approximately 110 to 120.

33:23.423 --> 33:24.990
You get that?

33:25.025 --> 33:28.394
See? Was that so hard?
How long was her body in the ground?

33:28.461 --> 33:31.130
You'd expect to see that
level of decomposition

33:31.198 --> 33:34.300
if a body had been buried
for between 6 to 12 months,

33:34.334 --> 33:36.402
- depending on inclement weather...
- She'll be up for parole

33:36.436 --> 33:37.903
by the time we're done with this.

33:37.971 --> 33:40.205
I can only let you do this
for about five more minutes.

33:40.273 --> 33:45.344
- Your lips are blue.
- Mm. Thanks.

33:45.378 --> 33:48.247
What does Paddy do for you
for you to take this risk?

33:50.250 --> 33:54.254
It's what he doesn't do.
I got a brother on the inside.

33:54.288 --> 33:56.122
<i>I got six hits.</i>

33:56.156 --> 33:57.356
[computer beeping]

33:57.390 --> 33:59.158
<i>Maura, can you see these photos?</i>

33:59.193 --> 34:01.427
Uh, yes. Sorry.

34:01.462 --> 34:02.929
<i>Is it one of these women?</i>

34:02.963 --> 34:05.031
I don't know. I...

34:05.066 --> 34:07.400
Susie, there are crime-scene
photos of the bones.

34:07.435 --> 34:09.835
Yeah, I have them right here.

34:09.871 --> 34:11.237
[computer beeps]

34:11.272 --> 34:13.507
The distance between the conical orbits,

34:13.541 --> 34:15.875
the size and symmetry
of the nasal opening,

34:15.909 --> 34:17.110
the pronounced zygomatic bones...

34:17.143 --> 34:18.777
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

34:18.812 --> 34:20.980
Well, I really need more
comparable data, Jane.

34:21.014 --> 34:23.315
<i>No, you really need to
sleep in your own bed.</i>

34:25.052 --> 34:28.855
Judging by the broad, round
facial-projection features,

34:28.889 --> 34:32.492
she's likely of African
or South American descent.

34:32.525 --> 34:36.161
I'll have to go with number five.
Susie, what do you think?

34:36.197 --> 34:38.898
Definitely number five.

34:38.933 --> 34:39.966
[computer beeping]

34:40.001 --> 34:43.838
Sofia Alvares, 23.
Brazilian swimsuit model.

34:43.871 --> 34:45.273
Missing 10 months.

34:45.306 --> 34:48.775
Got it ... we matched the print
on the keypad to Brad Adams.

34:48.811 --> 34:50.411
So we can prove he was here.

34:50.446 --> 34:52.246
<i>But why would he want those bones?</i>

34:52.281 --> 34:55.149
Susie, I want to see
all the photographs of the bones.

34:55.183 --> 34:57.218
Susie: CSRU didn't
find all of her remains.

34:57.252 --> 35:00.054
<i>I know. It's a partial skeleton.
Just show me the next photo.</i>

35:00.088 --> 35:02.957
<i>Stop right there.
Go closer on the hyoid.</i>

35:04.493 --> 35:06.427
We need a cause of death.

35:06.462 --> 35:08.496
Well, it would be better
if I could do an autopsy.

35:08.530 --> 35:10.531
<i>Maura, Popov will be here soon.</i>

35:10.566 --> 35:14.902
Crushed hyoid bone.
Could you show me Brad's neck?

35:18.373 --> 35:22.242
- It is so reckless to guess.
- You're in jail. Ask the guards.

35:22.277 --> 35:24.244
They're not gonna add
more time for guessing.

35:24.278 --> 35:27.948
Cause of death appears to be
the same for both Brad and Sofia.

35:28.015 --> 35:30.250
All right, well, that means
we're looking for one killer.

35:30.284 --> 35:34.488
So, he hired Brad to hit on Maura,
break in here, and steal Sofia's bones?

35:34.589 --> 35:37.191
Yeah. No disrespect, Maura,
but why did our killer think

35:37.225 --> 35:39.093
that you could tie
him to Sofia's murder?

35:39.161 --> 35:41.028
<i>I don't know.</i>

35:41.062 --> 35:43.965
<i>Susie, were any more bones
from the site delivered today?</i>

35:43.999 --> 35:48.136
Uh, yes, but they're just fragments.
I started laying them out.

35:49.605 --> 35:52.406
<i>Isolate that small bone on the left.</i>

35:52.441 --> 35:54.041
Describe it to me.

35:54.075 --> 35:57.144
A fragment approximately
8 millimeters long...

35:57.179 --> 35:59.847
With an epiphyseal end.

35:59.881 --> 36:02.951
It's not a bone fragment.
It's a fetal clavicle.

36:02.985 --> 36:04.219
She was pregnant?

36:04.253 --> 36:06.287
Somewhere between eight and nine weeks.

36:06.321 --> 36:09.357
That's what he was afraid of.
Fetal DNA would tie him to Sofia.

36:09.391 --> 36:11.960
Because our killer is
the father of her baby.

36:21.273 --> 36:23.273
Ok thanks, Susie.

36:23.274 --> 36:26.076
Susie was able to extract fetal DNA
from that fetal clavicle.

36:26.110 --> 36:28.645
- Did she compare it to Brad's DNA?
- Yeah. It's just like we thought.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.947
- We can rule Brad out as the father.
- Brad's DNA?

36:30.982 --> 36:32.916
We should run that DNA through CODIS.

36:32.984 --> 36:35.552
Wow.
Hey, Korsak, you're gonna be glad

36:35.586 --> 36:39.022
you didn't fall asleep in
the break room. Look at this.

36:39.057 --> 36:43.093
- Is that Sofia?
- Uh-huh, and her supermodel pals.

36:43.128 --> 36:46.163
- Wait. What club is that?
- Hollow Venom.

36:46.198 --> 36:48.399
Frankie said that Brad worked there.

36:48.433 --> 36:51.101
<i>And there he is.</i>

36:51.136 --> 36:53.337
Just established a connection
between Brad and Sofia.

36:53.372 --> 36:56.140
Yeah, but we also confirmed
cause of death for the both of them

36:56.208 --> 36:58.209
with the help of Maura,
who is also our suspect.

36:58.244 --> 37:01.179
Frost: Any chance Dr. Popov
could come up with the same findings?

37:01.214 --> 37:04.116
Please, the only thing I'm certain
Popov will find is some chilled vodka.

37:04.217 --> 37:06.418
There's got to be something we can do
with all that equipment down there.

37:10.556 --> 37:13.591
I can't.
It's a criminal violation,

37:13.626 --> 37:15.193
and it could ruin the
evidence for court.

37:15.227 --> 37:16.494
I'm not asking you to cut him open.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.362
I just want to get a
look at his hyoid bone

37:18.396 --> 37:19.630
to see if it was crushed like Sofia's.

37:19.665 --> 37:22.033
I mean, what about an X-ray or an MRI?

37:22.067 --> 37:23.467
That won't show you enough.

37:23.502 --> 37:26.703
Fine.
What about that fluoroscope thing?

37:26.738 --> 37:28.238
Might work.

37:28.272 --> 37:33.175
We can at least see
the tissue below the surface.

37:37.180 --> 37:39.748
Okay, that. That ...
that's bruising, right?

37:39.782 --> 37:42.350
There's a distinctive
subdural hematoma, yes.

37:42.418 --> 37:44.185
The shape of that
bruise doesn't look like

37:44.253 --> 37:45.753
it would be caused by an elbow strike.

37:45.788 --> 37:47.622
It's more consistent
with the shape of a ...

37:47.657 --> 37:51.025
A closed fist. That's weird.
Why are those bruises there?

37:51.060 --> 37:52.694
Those three distinctive oval marks?

37:52.728 --> 37:54.663
I don't know what could
leave marks like that.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.168
All right, well, it's ...
it's more than we had before.

37:59.203 --> 38:02.472
- Maura would be very proud of you.
- She's my hero.

38:03.741 --> 38:05.174
So are you!

38:06.409 --> 38:07.676
But she's an M.D.

38:07.711 --> 38:09.712
[cellphone buzzes, beeps]

38:09.746 --> 38:14.683
We got a hit. I think we just
I.D.'d Sofia's baby daddy.

38:14.717 --> 38:18.120
Tucker Franklin was the
father of Sofia's baby?

38:18.154 --> 38:21.189
<i>Korsak: Yep, Tucker Franklin,
famous golf pro and philanthropist.</i>

38:21.224 --> 38:24.393
Crazy, right?
Nothing came up on CODIS,

38:24.461 --> 38:26.361
so we ran it through
other DNA databases.

38:26.396 --> 38:29.531
Tucker's DNA was on file
with his bone-marrow charity.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.233
Tucker introduced Maura to Brad.

38:31.267 --> 38:34.169
Because they knew each other.
Look at this.

38:34.204 --> 38:35.304
[computer beeps]

38:35.338 --> 38:38.774
- Tucker going into a fancy club.
- Hollow Venom again.

38:38.808 --> 38:40.442
That's the same club Sofia frequented.

38:40.477 --> 38:43.212
And there's Tucker with
his bouncer friend, Brad.

38:43.246 --> 38:44.746
You know, 
Frankie said Brad was the guy

38:44.781 --> 38:47.382
who hooked up celebrities
with women and drugs.

38:47.416 --> 38:50.318
Looks like Brad hooked
Tucker up with Sofia,

38:50.353 --> 38:52.487
but Sofia got in the family way.

38:52.521 --> 38:55.090
The only way Tucker holds on
to his fat endorsement deals

38:55.124 --> 38:57.459
and his marriage 
was to eliminate her.

38:57.494 --> 38:59.795
Once those bones surfaced,
he knew it was just a matter of time

38:59.829 --> 39:01.630
before Maura identified Sofia

39:01.664 --> 39:04.600
and tied Tucker's DNA
to their unborn baby.

39:04.634 --> 39:08.704
- But why did Tucker kill Brad?
- Tucker didn't want to leave any witness.

39:08.738 --> 39:10.239
You know, 
one good punch to the throat

39:10.273 --> 39:12.441
with something to
protect those soft hands.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.610
We still don't have enough
probable cause to arrest him.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.245
We do have enough to
question him, though.

39:23.621 --> 39:26.089
[engine shuts off]

39:26.124 --> 39:29.359
<i>Woman: Look, it's Tucker Franklin!</i>

39:29.394 --> 39:30.427
Park it up front, pal.

39:30.462 --> 39:32.163
<i>Man: Yo, Tucker Franklin, man!</i>

39:32.197 --> 39:34.732
<i>[chuckles]
Tucker Franklin!</i>

39:34.766 --> 39:37.435
Would you look at that?

39:37.469 --> 39:40.571
I bet that would leave
three distinct oval bruises.

39:42.708 --> 39:44.375
Hey, Tucker.

39:46.845 --> 39:49.713
- Do I know you?
- You know me well enough

39:49.748 --> 39:51.181
to take my $1,000
check for your charity.

39:51.216 --> 39:54.718
- Oh. Well, thanks.
- This is a nice keychain.

39:54.786 --> 39:58.288
- What are you doing with my keys?
- Oh, I'm not the valet.

39:58.322 --> 39:59.789
You know, it makes sense

39:59.824 --> 40:01.591
that you'd want to protect
that million-dollar grip.

40:01.625 --> 40:03.559
You can't use those soft
hands to punch people.

40:03.594 --> 40:05.562
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

40:05.596 --> 40:06.863
Hell of a swing, too.

40:08.566 --> 40:10.333
And with these brass
knuckles, it would just take

40:10.367 --> 40:13.837
one good punch to the throat
to kill Sofia... and Brad.

40:17.474 --> 40:19.575
[sighing] Oh, my god.

40:19.643 --> 40:22.444
Guess we're gonna have to park
that Hummer in the impound lot.

40:22.479 --> 40:24.146
Tucker Franklin, you're under arrest

40:24.214 --> 40:27.716
for the murder of Sofia
Alvares and Brad Adams.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.252
[handcuffs clicking]

40:37.928 --> 40:40.862
[applause]

40:40.897 --> 40:45.467
Thank you. Thank you.
Oh.

40:45.501 --> 40:49.504
So many of you admire me,
Dr. Vladimir Popov, and my work.

40:49.605 --> 40:50.638
<i>Korsak: Leave it to Popov.</i>

40:55.344 --> 40:57.512
<i>Excuse me.</i>

40:57.547 --> 41:01.183
Oh.
Girl.

41:01.217 --> 41:03.619
<i>I need this cold.</i>

41:05.956 --> 41:07.523
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:07.557 --> 41:08.991
You sure know how to make an entrance.

41:09.025 --> 41:09.925
[chuckles]

41:11.528 --> 41:13.762
I was thinking of wearing
my neon orange jumpsuit,

41:13.797 --> 41:14.864
but I thought it'd be too much.

41:14.898 --> 41:16.365
Yeah, you can wear it tomorrow.

41:16.400 --> 41:21.237
- So, did you get any new prison tats?
- None that I want to show you.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.806
Mm!
So, what do you want to do now?

41:23.841 --> 41:26.609
- Go to work.
- Okay.

41:26.643 --> 41:29.712
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

41:29.747 --> 41:31.314
Thank you.
