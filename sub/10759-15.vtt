WEBVTT

00:08.908 --> 00:10.310
ROZ:
Hey, Martin.

00:10.310 --> 00:11.745
Happy Valentine's Day.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.146
Oh, thanks, Roz.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.181
So, you're with us
tonight, huh?

00:15.181 --> 00:17.550
Yeah. We rented a couple
of sad chick movies.

00:17.550 --> 00:18.952
Oh, it's not like you
not to have a date

00:18.952 --> 00:20.787
on Valentine's Day.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.922
Tell me. I usually try
for a second seating.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.724
(chuckles)

00:24.724 --> 00:25.525
And you'd think
that being engaged,

00:25.525 --> 00:27.961
I'd have a guaranteed date,
but no...

00:27.961 --> 00:29.796
Donny had to
go to Florida.

00:29.796 --> 00:30.797
His grandmother.

00:30.797 --> 00:32.665
She'd do anything
to come between us.

00:32.665 --> 00:33.900
Oh, what'd she do this time?

00:33.900 --> 00:35.502
She died.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.305
Good Lord,
where is Niles?

00:39.305 --> 00:41.107
I don't want to be late
for the opera.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.376
Are you going out with Niles
on Valentine's Day?

00:43.376 --> 00:45.712
Well, it's a subscription
series, you see.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.080
We got these tickets
months ago.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.481
We had no idea
what day this fell on.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.884
So Dr. Crane's not spending
tonight with Mel?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.786
FRASIER:
No. She's going out of town.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.487
Some sort of medical conference.
(doorbell rings)

00:54.487 --> 00:56.723
You know, actually,
I'm sorry for Niles,

00:56.723 --> 00:59.225
but, uh, I'm rather glad
to be having

00:59.225 --> 01:01.094
an old-fashioned
boys' night out.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.962
I can't wait, either.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.964
I-I'll see you
in 20 minutes, valentine.

01:04.964 --> 01:07.467
(kissing sound)

01:07.967 --> 01:09.436
That had better be
the seat duster

01:09.436 --> 01:10.437
in our opera box.

01:10.437 --> 01:11.738
Oh...

01:11.738 --> 01:12.472
No, it was Mel.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.408
At the last minute, she decided
to skip her conference.

01:15.408 --> 01:18.778
So... I'll be going
to the opera by myself.

01:18.778 --> 01:20.713
Oh! Well, here's a thought:

01:20.713 --> 01:22.215
If you give Mel
your opera ticket,

01:22.215 --> 01:23.116
then you won't have
to be alone.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.585
You can stay here
and-and watch fun movies

01:25.585 --> 01:27.087
with Roz and Daphne.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.388
Ooh.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.656
Dying Young.

01:29.656 --> 01:32.559
It's a... classic.

01:32.559 --> 01:33.760
FRASIER:
I am surprised by your gall.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.562
At the last moment,
you-you not only bail on me,

01:35.562 --> 01:37.030
you expect me to give up
my own ticket?!

01:37.030 --> 01:38.465
Please, Frasier,
put yourself in my shoes.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.033
I have to do something for Mel.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.035
Every restaurant in town's
been booked for weeks.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.003
I ran into Archie
Wilfong today.

01:44.003 --> 01:46.506
He told me he had to settle
for two seats at the counter

01:46.506 --> 01:48.508
at The Salad Experience.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.877
What would you suggest I do?

01:50.877 --> 01:54.013
Bring your own wine
and order the spicy Caesar.

01:56.015 --> 01:59.052
May your opera box
be full of cellophane crinklers

01:59.052 --> 02:01.054
and the stage swarming
with standbys.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.522
Get out!

02:04.491 --> 02:07.460
He goes too far.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.928
Yeah, some nerve--

02:08.928 --> 02:10.395
ditching you
to spend Valentine's Day

02:10.896 --> 02:11.397
with his girlfriend.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.732
Look, Fras,

02:12.732 --> 02:13.533
I don't blame
you for being

02:13.533 --> 02:15.034
a little jealous 'cause
he's got someone,

02:15.034 --> 02:16.536
and you don't...
I am not jealous, Dad.

02:16.536 --> 02:17.504
I am simply
appalled

02:17.504 --> 02:18.471
by his rudeness.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.973
I was looking forward
to this evening.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.976
Nice drink...
lovely opera...

02:22.976 --> 02:25.478
then a late supper...

02:25.478 --> 02:27.480
perhaps a beautiful bottle
of wine,

02:27.480 --> 02:31.484
and a delightful...
dessert soufflÃ©...

02:31.484 --> 02:34.821
Oh, God, I need a woman.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.090
Remember
my friend Rowena?

02:37.090 --> 02:40.059
She's much prettier
since her surgery.

02:40.059 --> 02:41.060
You look at her face,

02:41.060 --> 02:43.363
and you can't even tell
where it used to be.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.599
Thank you, Daphne,
but, uh...

02:46.599 --> 02:48.301
actually, I
already have

02:48.301 --> 02:50.603
someone in mind, you see.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.605
There's a stunning woman

02:52.605 --> 02:55.108
who comes to the opera
on the same nights we do.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.610
She has the box
right across from ours.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.079
We've flirted a bit
from a distance.

03:00.079 --> 03:02.982
I have laughed with
her during Figaro,

03:02.982 --> 03:05.351
and I've cried with her
during Tosca.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.853
I even had a dream
about her

03:06.853 --> 03:09.756
during "Einstein
on the Beach."

03:09.756 --> 03:11.624
Well, don't just stare
at her, make a move.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.892
FRASIER:
I will, Roz!

03:12.892 --> 03:13.693
Tonight's the night.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.695
By the finale,
I'll have made my overture.

03:15.695 --> 03:16.696
Dad, would you please come
with me?

03:16.696 --> 03:17.697
To the opera?
Please?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.698
What do you
need me for?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.200
Dad, look, I-I can't go
with a woman

03:20.200 --> 03:21.201
because then she'll think
I'm on a date,

03:21.201 --> 03:23.469
and if I go alone, she'll think
I couldn't get a date.

03:23.469 --> 03:24.704
You would look
pretty pathetic.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.139
Oh, geez.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.106
Or you can stay
home with us

03:27.106 --> 03:28.575
and watch sad movies.

03:28.575 --> 03:29.509
Sophie's Choice.

03:29.509 --> 03:32.011
I'll say it is.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.017
(crowd murmuring)
MARTIN: Is she here yet?

03:38.017 --> 03:39.018
FRASIER:
No, not yet.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.421
That's her box over
there-- the empty one.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.323
Well, I'm not going to sit
through a whole opera

03:43.323 --> 03:44.657
for some woman
who's not even here.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.025
Oh, for God sakes, Dad,
give it a chance.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.026
You might actually learn
to like it

03:47.026 --> 03:48.394
if you'd listen to one.

03:48.394 --> 03:49.762
Hey, your mother dragged me
to a lot of these things

03:49.762 --> 03:51.764
when we were dating,
and they were all stupid.

03:51.764 --> 03:53.766
These stories make
no sense whatsoever.

03:53.766 --> 03:55.034
Oh, that is not true.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.302
Oh, all right,
what's this one about?

03:56.302 --> 03:57.203
Well, it's about
Rigoletto--

03:57.203 --> 03:58.104
the hunchback jester

03:58.104 --> 03:59.105
in the court
of the duke.

03:59.105 --> 04:00.607
He has a
daughter, Gilda,

04:00.607 --> 04:01.608
who's secretly
living with him,

04:01.608 --> 04:03.610
but everyone thinks
that she's his mistress.

04:03.610 --> 04:04.611
In this opening scene,

04:05.111 --> 04:07.113
Rigoletto mocks
the duke's enemy,

04:07.113 --> 04:08.615
who puts a
curse on him.

04:08.615 --> 04:10.116
A cursed hunchback
dating his daughter.

04:10.116 --> 04:12.619
Well, nothing screwy
so far.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.121
He is not dating
his daughter.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.123
Gilda is being
courted by the duke,

04:17.123 --> 04:19.058
who is disguised
as a humble student.

04:19.058 --> 04:19.959
You see, that's what I mean.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.295
The whole thing's
so unrealistic.

04:22.295 --> 04:23.763
Everybody's in love

04:23.763 --> 04:25.665
and pretending to be
somebody they're not,

04:25.665 --> 04:27.567
and they're all swooning
and gasping...

04:27.567 --> 04:28.568
(gasps)

04:28.568 --> 04:30.903
See, exactly.
Who acts that way?

04:30.903 --> 04:32.205
No, Dad, Dad, she's
here, she's here,

04:32.205 --> 04:33.139
and she's not
on a date.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.207
That must be
her mother.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.676
(gasps):
Wow. You're right.

04:36.676 --> 04:39.145
She is a looker,
all right.

04:39.145 --> 04:40.546
All right, don't
gawk, don't gawk.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.081
She'll notice. Well,
I thought that was the point.

04:42.081 --> 04:43.283
No, no, Dad. You got to
get her attention.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.117
No, Dad, Dad, please!

04:44.117 --> 04:46.586
Don't wave, don't...!

04:46.586 --> 04:48.554
Just-just keep your eye
on the stage.

04:48.554 --> 04:50.390
All right, but I bet you
that gets results.

04:50.390 --> 04:53.993
Oh.
Oh.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.096
You're right, Dad, it did.

04:57.096 --> 04:58.865
(gasping)

04:58.865 --> 05:00.867
Oh, God, I wasn't waving at her.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.368
I was waving at the daughter.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.170
FRASIER: Mm-hmm.
(chuckling)

05:04.170 --> 05:05.505
Well, that's not what the
mother seems to think.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.506
I think she likes you.

05:06.506 --> 05:07.340
Wave back.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.174
No. I don't want to.

05:08.174 --> 05:09.676
Come on, wave back.
(music begins)

05:09.676 --> 05:11.177
You started it.
Wave back to her.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.680
Aw, geez.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.051
Hunchback's got
kind of a nice voice,

05:18.051 --> 05:19.552
but the daughter's
kind of screechy.

05:19.552 --> 05:22.055
Yeah, well, she's
no Renata Tebaldi.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.824
FRASIER:
Gosh, I don't see them. Do you?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.592
Oh, I bet you the old one's
in the ladies' room,

05:26.592 --> 05:28.861
putting on more war paint.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.096
FRASIER:
Oh, there they are.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.597
Just try
to be nice, Dad.

05:31.597 --> 05:32.598
If you are rude
to the mother,

05:32.598 --> 05:35.034
you will ruin my chances
with the daughter.

05:35.034 --> 05:37.403
Well, we finally meet.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.972
I feel like we're
practically old friends.

05:39.972 --> 05:40.773
Yes.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.075
I'm Helen Browning.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.443
This is my daughter, Emily.

05:43.443 --> 05:44.243
Ah.
Ah.

05:44.243 --> 05:45.578
Hello. I'm Frasier Crane.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.380
Uh, this is my father,

05:47.380 --> 05:48.815
Martin Crane.
Hi, how are you?

05:49.315 --> 05:50.283
(all greeting each other)

05:50.283 --> 05:51.217
Uh, well, uh...

05:51.217 --> 05:53.453
can we get you
some champagne?

05:53.453 --> 05:54.253
Oh, we'd love it.

05:54.253 --> 05:55.755
Thank you.
Let me give you a hand.

05:55.755 --> 05:56.756
No, Dad,
you know what, Dad?

05:56.756 --> 05:57.757
We can manage. Uh...

05:57.757 --> 05:59.258
Oh.
Why don't you two stay

05:59.258 --> 06:00.259
and have
a nice little chat?

06:00.259 --> 06:02.762
Okay.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.764
Lovely production,
isn't it?

06:04.764 --> 06:06.733
Mm...
I adore Verdi.

06:06.733 --> 06:10.169
Oh, he's my favorite.

06:10.169 --> 06:13.539
Though, the woman
singing Gilda's a bit off.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.942
Mm, she's no Renata Tebaldi.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.410
You know,

06:17.410 --> 06:18.845
if you like Verdi so much,

06:18.845 --> 06:21.314
I happen to have a spare ticket
to Aida next week.

06:21.314 --> 06:22.782
Oh, that sounds great,

06:22.782 --> 06:24.784
but, uh, if it's a week
from tonight, I'm busy.

06:24.784 --> 06:26.052
I'm sorry.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.320
Actually, it's
next Thursday.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.321
Oh! Thursd...

06:28.321 --> 06:30.323
Oh, you know,
there's this thing

06:30.323 --> 06:33.192
at my, uh...
uh, my wine club.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.595
Oh, that's all right, Martin.
We just met.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.596
I shouldn't have asked, and...

06:36.596 --> 06:37.997
Oh, no, no, no,
Helen,

06:37.997 --> 06:39.399
it's got nothing
to do with you. It's me.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.435
I'm-I'm afraid I've given you
the wrong impression of myself.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.804
You see, the truth is, I'm...

06:44.804 --> 06:47.673
Gay.

06:49.675 --> 06:52.945
Uh, right. Gay.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.814
I thought you might be.

06:54.814 --> 06:58.217
How many straight men
remember Renata Tebaldi?

06:58.217 --> 07:01.554
(chuckles):
Not many.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.023
Well, I'm sorry
if I was too forward.

07:04.023 --> 07:07.293
It's just that sometimes
it's so hard to meet nice men.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.561
Tell me.

07:08.561 --> 07:09.929
(laughs)

07:09.929 --> 07:11.798
Here we are.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.800
Uh, Dad, uh...
Thank you.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.834
Actually, uh,
good news.

07:14.834 --> 07:15.668
Emily has agreed

07:15.668 --> 07:17.870
to join me
for a nightcap

07:17.870 --> 07:19.672
after the opera
and cast her eye

07:19.672 --> 07:21.207
over my African
art collection.

07:21.207 --> 07:22.175
(chimes ringing)

07:22.175 --> 07:23.142
Oh.
Oh.

07:23.142 --> 07:24.577
Well, very nice
meeting you.

07:24.577 --> 07:25.445
MARTIN:
Nice meeting you, too.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.379
Bye.
So, I'll see you later?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.314
Yes.
All right.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.782
So, how did it
go with Helen?

07:29.782 --> 07:30.783
You didn't offend
her, did you?

07:30.783 --> 07:31.784
No. Not at all.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.720
Turns out
I'm not her type.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.689
Well?
Opera queen.

07:36.689 --> 07:38.191
Oh. Sorry.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.993
Though, you know
who'd he'd be perfect for?

07:40.993 --> 07:42.295
Yes!

07:42.295 --> 07:43.796
You know,
he's here tonight.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.298
I'll bring him.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.666
(chimes ringing)

07:46.666 --> 07:48.134
All right, Dad, we'd
better hurry up.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.602
Don't want to miss
the second act.

07:49.602 --> 07:50.603
Oh, who cares?

07:50.603 --> 07:51.604
Just be more
goofy stuff

07:51.604 --> 07:54.640
that never happens
in real life.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.546
(dramatic score playing)

08:00.546 --> 08:03.049
How was
the opera?

08:03.049 --> 08:05.518
Lovely. Get out.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.019
Hey! That movie's
not over.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.020
FRASIER:
That's too bad, Roz.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.522
There's a stunning woman
on her way over here.

08:09.522 --> 08:10.523
I don't want her thinking
I'm running

08:10.523 --> 08:12.325
some sort of a maudlin
sorority house.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.659
Now, come on.
Shake a leg.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.627
You actually spoke
to her?

08:14.627 --> 08:15.928
You didn't wimp out?

08:15.928 --> 08:17.230
You have never seen me so suave.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.198
Oh, some
Valentine's Day.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.700
First my date
bails on me,

08:20.700 --> 08:24.170
and now I owe Daphne
50 bucks.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.605
Well, hello there.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.607
Will you be my Ballantine?

08:27.607 --> 08:30.543
Dad, will you go get
a glass, please?

08:30.543 --> 08:31.944
Oh, all right.
(doorbell rings)

08:31.944 --> 08:32.879
FRASIER:
And drink it quickly!

08:32.879 --> 08:33.779
The last thing I need tonight

08:33.779 --> 08:36.249
is some third wheel
cramping my style.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.284
Hello.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.720
Hello.
EMILY: I hope you don't mind.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.154
Edward here
was at the opera, too.

08:42.154 --> 08:43.990
He's, uh, my partner.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.791
Your partner?
EDWARD: At the gallery.

08:45.791 --> 08:47.193
I'm also her uncle.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.160
Oh. When you said, "partner,"

08:48.160 --> 08:49.529
I thought you meant
romantic partner.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.997
Oh.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.965
Hardly.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.801
Well, I'm, uh... I'm Frasier.

08:55.801 --> 08:58.471
Pleasure. What a marvelous view!
Thank you.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.272
Oh.
May I?

08:59.272 --> 09:00.773
Yes, please.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.643
Your father.

09:03.643 --> 09:06.579
Is he... dating
anyone at the moment?

09:06.579 --> 09:08.981
Well, uh... no,

09:08.981 --> 09:09.982
but if you're thinking
about your mother,

09:10.483 --> 09:12.485
I-I'm afraid they're not
really right for each other.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.386
(laughs)

09:13.386 --> 09:17.123
Yes, I know.
I meant... Edward.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.493
Your uncle?

09:20.493 --> 09:22.495
Yes.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.497
And my father?

09:24.497 --> 09:26.933
They're both single,
they love opera,

09:26.933 --> 09:28.968
and they were both
married with kids

09:28.968 --> 09:30.736
when they came
out of the closet.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.540
Your dad told my
mother all about it.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.375
Oh, did he? Ah.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.244
Well, she asked him out,

09:38.244 --> 09:39.946
and he had to be honest
with her.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.681
Hi there.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.049
Yes. Nothing like
a little honesty

09:43.049 --> 09:45.551
to diffuse
an awkward situation.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.553
Oh. Hi there.
How are you?

09:47.553 --> 09:48.554
Here. Let me take
your coat.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.057
Uh, Dad, this is Edward,
uh, Emily's uncle.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.059
He's her partner
in her art gallery.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.561
Uh, Edward, this is
my father, Martin.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.063
Pleased to meet you,
Martin.

09:57.063 --> 09:57.897
Uh, same here.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.665
And my friends call me Marty.

09:59.665 --> 10:01.567
Then Marty it is.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.469
(laughing)

10:05.204 --> 10:07.073
I love what you've done
with this place.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.575
It's the perfect blend
of sleek elegance...

10:09.575 --> 10:12.078
and audacious whimsy.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.045
Oh.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.947
You like it, huh?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.916
You know, Edward's
my favorite name.

10:16.916 --> 10:17.917
Really?
Yes.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.418
I even call
my dog Eddie.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.420
Eddie! Yeah, see?
Here he is.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.222
Oh...

10:23.222 --> 10:24.056
A Jack Russell.

10:24.056 --> 10:25.524
He loves Jack
Russells.

10:25.524 --> 10:26.859
I have three of them.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.227
All girls.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.229
Oh, well, we ought
to get them together.

10:30.229 --> 10:32.231
Who knows, maybe a little
romance will bloom.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.571
You know, Dad,
maybe we should go

10:38.571 --> 10:41.073
fetch our new friends
some, uh, drinks.

10:41.073 --> 10:43.342
EMILY: Uh, I'd love
some white wine.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.110
How about you, Ed?

10:44.110 --> 10:45.077
Why not a beer?

10:45.077 --> 10:48.047
Oh... a man after
my own heart.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.048
(laughs)

10:52.018 --> 10:53.953
Boy, you are
really something.

10:53.953 --> 10:54.887
What?

10:54.887 --> 10:56.956
You actually told
Emily's mother

10:57.456 --> 10:58.457
that you were gay?

10:58.457 --> 10:59.959
Well, you said
not to offend her.

10:59.959 --> 11:00.960
I thought that was
a pretty good way

11:01.460 --> 11:01.894
to get her
to cool her jets

11:02.461 --> 11:03.462
without hurting
her feelings.

11:03.462 --> 11:04.463
(chuckles)

11:04.463 --> 11:06.966
Dad, there's something
you don't understand.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.801
You see, she told Emily.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.569
She got a problem with it?

11:10.569 --> 11:12.505
Oh, no, she's pretty okay
with it.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.773
Oh.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.075
Oh, I get it-- you're worried
she'll know I'm straight

11:16.075 --> 11:17.009
and find out I've been lying
to her mother.

11:17.009 --> 11:17.977
Dad...

11:17.977 --> 11:18.978
Oh, well, don't
worry about it.

11:19.478 --> 11:21.981
I'll gay it up
a little.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.187
Emily, have I told
you I love your hair?

11:28.187 --> 11:29.221
Oh.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.990
Thank you, Martin.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.292
It's divine.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.764
Frasier, these pieces
are wonderful.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.266
Oh.
You have exquisite taste.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.702
Oh, he gets
that from me.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.438
Yes, it was worth
all the hours

11:45.438 --> 11:47.740
I dragged him around
to the museums

11:47.740 --> 11:48.708
and the antique shops

11:48.708 --> 11:50.743
and teaching
him about art

11:50.743 --> 11:55.648
and, you know...
upholstery.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.517
Were you in the arts?

11:58.517 --> 11:59.518
Oh, well,
actually, Ed...

11:59.518 --> 12:01.420
Dad was a cop.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.622
Really?
Mm-hmm.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.792
The, uh, uniform and everything?

12:09.095 --> 12:11.931
Yeah. In fact, uh, that's
what happened to my hip.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.400
I took a-a-a bullet trying
to break up a robbery.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.868
Yeah, I called
for backup,

12:15.868 --> 12:16.836
but it never
showed up.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.171
(sighs):
Because you were gay.

12:19.171 --> 12:23.976
Don't think I didn't
wonder about that.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.484
Yes, that was the day
I came out.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.819
Lying in that alley
covered with blood,

12:34.320 --> 12:35.821
a bullet in my
hip, and I said,

12:35.821 --> 12:37.823
"That's it.
I'm gay.

12:37.823 --> 12:38.824
"I like myself,

12:38.824 --> 12:42.261
and I'm not living
a lie anymore."

12:44.597 --> 12:49.535
I had exactly the same
experience when I came out.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:00.513 --> 13:02.281
Not exactly,
perhaps.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.517
Yours was a bullet
in the hip.

13:04.517 --> 13:10.122
For me, it was a Lufthansa
steward named Gunter.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.625
What did I tell you?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.626
I knew they'd hit it off.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.062
Yes, I had a
feeling myself.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.866
And you didn't say
a word, you scamp.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.269
Uh, Frasier,
why don't you come

13:23.269 --> 13:26.272
help me get some snacks
for everybody?

13:26.272 --> 13:27.740
All right.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.543
If you'll excuse us.

13:30.543 --> 13:31.811
You didn't tell me
this was a setup.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.312
Well, how blind
can you be, Dad?

13:33.312 --> 13:34.814
He didn't seem gay
to you?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.315
He's English;
they all seem gay.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.316
Oh, Lord.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.318
Well, we're just going to
have to tell them the truth.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.320
Oh, what, you found
her mother so unattractive

13:41.320 --> 13:42.321
you pretended to be gay?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.323
Dad, Emily is
the most fabulous woman

13:44.323 --> 13:45.324
I have met in ages,

13:45.324 --> 13:46.325
and if you screw
this up for me,

13:46.826 --> 13:47.326
I will never forgive you,

13:47.827 --> 13:48.694
so just be nice,
all right?

13:48.694 --> 13:50.329
Well, what if he asks me
for a date?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.031
I have news for you:
You're on a date.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.467
Daphne.
We've just been chatting

13:55.968 --> 13:58.470
with your delightful
physical therapist, Marty.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.706
Oh, he's a charmer,
this one.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.341
Now aren't you
glad you went

14:02.341 --> 14:03.108
to the opera?

14:03.108 --> 14:05.077
I keep telling him
he should get out more,

14:05.077 --> 14:05.911
meet people.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.780
Most nights
he just sits here alone

14:07.780 --> 14:08.714
watching the telly.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.649
He's the exact same way.

14:10.649 --> 14:12.151
He'll watch anything.
Yeah.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.986
With him, it's
mostly sports.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.754
Just give him a bunch
of sweaty men

14:15.754 --> 14:17.156
chasing each other
around a field...

14:17.156 --> 14:18.924
Daphne.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.826
Excuse me.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.329
Where are we, uh, keeping
the Camembert these days?

14:23.329 --> 14:24.330
Same place
we always do.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.664
(under breath):
Get in the kitchen.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.666
You were smart
to hire a woman

14:27.666 --> 14:28.667
for physical therapy.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.036
Much safer than a man.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.404
Edward sprained
his leg last year...

14:32.404 --> 14:33.272
All right, Emily.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.174
I never trusted
that man.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.175
All right, Emily.

14:36.175 --> 14:37.676
And why you loaned
him your boat...

14:37.676 --> 14:40.045
(under breath):
All right, Emily!

14:41.814 --> 14:44.183
(Daphne laughing)

14:48.487 --> 14:49.989
Here we are.

14:49.989 --> 14:50.890
Thank you,
Frasier.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.691
I would love to see

14:52.691 --> 14:55.694
the rest of the apartment,
if it's no trouble.

14:56.262 --> 14:58.063
Why, that's no
trouble at all.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.798
Uh, Frasier, can-can I just...
Now, Dad,

14:59.798 --> 15:00.799
don't worry.

15:00.799 --> 15:02.801
I will close the door
to your room.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.803
You should see him whenever
he gets ready for the opera.

15:04.803 --> 15:07.172
Clothes everywhere.

15:08.874 --> 15:10.209
Well, I'm off to bed.

15:10.209 --> 15:11.644
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, Daph!

15:11.644 --> 15:13.145
Uh, Daphne,
why don't you join us?

15:13.145 --> 15:14.480
Oh, no, no, no.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.815
Three's a crowd.

15:21.287 --> 15:22.588
So...

15:22.588 --> 15:23.889
(both laughing)

15:23.889 --> 15:26.191
So...

15:26.191 --> 15:29.361
Our loved ones seemed determined
to thrust us together.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.764
Well, don't let
them pressure you.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.833
Oh.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.537
Congratulations, Marty,
on having raised

15:38.537 --> 15:40.306
such a splendid son.

15:40.306 --> 15:43.309
Oh.
I envy you your bond.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.211
Uh, you have kids?

15:46.211 --> 15:47.713
Just one.

15:47.713 --> 15:51.050
George. He's 35...

15:51.050 --> 15:54.320
and he has consecrated
his life to bowling.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.688
Oh.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.589
I join him
when I can, but...

15:57.589 --> 15:58.590
You're not
wild about it.

15:58.590 --> 15:59.992
No. I mean...

15:59.992 --> 16:02.361
the shoes.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.829
(Martin laughs)

16:03.829 --> 16:05.631
Strange, isn't it,

16:05.631 --> 16:07.366
the-the things we'll do
to be close to our children?

16:07.366 --> 16:08.767
Oh, yeah.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.269
I've let Frasier drag me

16:10.269 --> 16:12.271
to all kinds of places
I didn't want to go to

16:12.271 --> 16:14.106
just so that I could
spend some time with him.

16:14.106 --> 16:15.441
You know, sometimes,

16:15.441 --> 16:17.943
it's hard to humor
your kids, but...

16:17.943 --> 16:19.945
It's what we do.

16:19.945 --> 16:20.946
We're fathers.

16:20.946 --> 16:22.448
Exactly.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.283
Marty...

16:24.283 --> 16:26.752
would you be free
for dinner sometime?

16:27.686 --> 16:30.522
Oh, gee, I, uh...

16:30.522 --> 16:31.824
It's all right.
Never mind.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
No, no, no, no, I-I-I
mean, I'd love to.

16:33.826 --> 16:34.827
It's just that, uh...

16:34.827 --> 16:36.328
No need to explain.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.763
No, no, really, Ed,

16:37.763 --> 16:39.198
it's not you--
you're a great guy.

16:39.198 --> 16:44.603
It's just that I'm...
dating someone.

16:45.971 --> 16:48.707
Marty, you don't have
to spare my feelings.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.275
No, no, really, it's true.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.044
Hello.
Darling!

17:00.252 --> 17:01.253
Sorry.

17:01.754 --> 17:02.654
Am I interrupting
something?

17:02.654 --> 17:04.056
Oh, not a thing, honey.

17:04.056 --> 17:06.392
Just take off your coat
and stay a while.

17:09.127 --> 17:09.962
Okay, um...

17:09.962 --> 17:11.797
I, uh, I felt bad

17:11.797 --> 17:13.298
about that
squabble earlier,

17:13.799 --> 17:15.300
so I thought
I'd drop off

17:15.800 --> 17:16.667
this little
peace offering.

17:16.667 --> 17:17.502
(laughs)

17:17.502 --> 17:20.806
As if I could stay mad
at you.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.843
Uh, Edward, uh, this is
my boyfriend, Niles.

17:24.843 --> 17:28.347
Uh... Niles, uh,
this is Edward.

17:28.847 --> 17:29.848
We met at the opera
tonight.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.316
Delighted.
Hello.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.251
You needn't look
so startled.

17:32.251 --> 17:35.054
I assure you,
there's nothing funny going on.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.890
Oh, good.

17:39.658 --> 17:42.928
Well, uh, why don't
we go put this on ice?

17:46.932 --> 17:49.401
Of course, the finest
Gilda ever sung

17:49.401 --> 17:52.404
was by the great
Mathilde DeCagny.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.906
I actually have
the recording.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.408
I'd love to hear it.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.743
Where's Dad?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.079
He's in the kitchen
with his boyfriend.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.949
FRASIER:
Oh.

18:09.855 --> 18:12.791
Niles, what
brings you here?

18:12.791 --> 18:14.760
Well, it's my place, too.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.762
I can have company
if I want.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.730
Emily, this is Niles.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.666
Hello.
Hi.

18:20.666 --> 18:21.467
Um...

18:21.467 --> 18:22.801
I didn't realize

18:22.801 --> 18:24.303
your father
was seeing someone.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.804
Well, actually, I-I
didn't think he was.

18:25.804 --> 18:29.308
Um... since when
are you two an item?

18:29.308 --> 18:30.576
MARTIN:
Oh.

18:30.576 --> 18:31.844
Few weeks now.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.846
We-we didn't say anything
about it yet,

18:33.846 --> 18:37.816
because... well...

18:37.816 --> 18:40.819
So many reasons.

18:40.819 --> 18:41.854
You know,

18:41.854 --> 18:43.288
it's getting late, Emily.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.289
EMILY:
Oh, yes.

18:44.289 --> 18:45.290
We should be going.

18:45.791 --> 18:46.291
No, no, please, please,

18:46.792 --> 18:47.292
stay for just
five more minutes.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.795
I-I have a very special
old port

18:49.795 --> 18:51.797
that I'd love
for you to sample.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.298
(whispering):
Niles.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.237
How could
you do this to me?

18:58.237 --> 18:59.738
This was not my idea.

18:59.738 --> 19:02.741
Niles... Emily just kissed me
in the bedroom,

19:03.242 --> 19:04.243
and now she's leaving.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.245
I have never been
so embarrassed in my life.

19:06.245 --> 19:07.212
You're embarrassed?

19:07.212 --> 19:11.683
They think the best I can do
is an old man with a cane.

19:14.052 --> 19:15.888
You have got
to fix this.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.189
Oh, and how am I
supposed to do that?

19:17.189 --> 19:19.925
Well, isn't it obvious?
You've got to dump Dad.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.394
Ah, here we are.

19:22.394 --> 19:24.163
You really must

19:24.163 --> 19:25.430
try this.

19:25.430 --> 19:26.431
Thank you.

19:26.431 --> 19:27.933
Mm-hmm.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.368
So, Niles,
you actually,

19:29.368 --> 19:32.104
uh, missed a-a splendid evening
at the opera.

19:32.104 --> 19:32.905
Well, maybe I
can catch it

19:32.905 --> 19:34.406
this weekend
with Mel.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.407
Oh, and who's Mel?

19:35.407 --> 19:36.909
Damn you and your
jealous questions!

19:36.909 --> 19:38.744
You don't own me!

19:43.882 --> 19:45.217
MARTIN:
Niles!

19:45.217 --> 19:46.985
I was only asking.
You're always asking,

19:46.985 --> 19:48.453
badgering, spying on me.

19:48.453 --> 19:50.255
Well, I won't
be suffocated anymore.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.057
I'm tired of being
your trophy boy.

19:52.057 --> 19:53.859
It's over,
you hear me? Over!

19:54.693 --> 19:57.529
And I'm keeping the jewelry.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.705
Oh, Dad.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.107
I'm so sorry.

20:11.743 --> 20:15.581
Is there anything we can do?

20:15.581 --> 20:17.049
No, I'll be all right. I...

20:17.549 --> 20:20.052
I guess I always knew
it wouldn't last.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.453
Marty...

20:21.453 --> 20:23.755
the young ones never stay.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.526
I know what will cheer you up.

20:27.526 --> 20:28.894
That Rigoletto recording.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.395
Oh, yes, splendid.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.396
You know, Emily,
I'd love to hear it,

20:31.396 --> 20:32.898
but that shipment
is arriving

20:32.898 --> 20:33.899
bright and early.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.901
Oh, right.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.903
Uh, Frasier,

20:37.903 --> 20:40.372
I wish I could stay,

20:40.372 --> 20:42.207
but I'm Edward's ride.

20:42.207 --> 20:44.009
FRASIER:
Yes, what a shame.

20:44.009 --> 20:45.510
Well, I-I guess this
is good night, then.

20:45.978 --> 20:46.979
MARTIN:
No, no, wait a minute.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.914
Emily, uh...

20:48.914 --> 20:50.415
why don't you just
stay here with Frasier

20:50.415 --> 20:53.252
and enjoy the music.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.954
I'll give Edward a ride home.

20:55.954 --> 20:57.623
You would do
that, Dad?

20:58.323 --> 21:00.826
Happy Valentine's Day, son.

21:01.793 --> 21:03.595
Thanks, Dad.
All right,

21:03.595 --> 21:04.930
good night.
Good night.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.331
BOTH:
Good night.

21:07.799 --> 21:09.801
(music playing)

21:09.801 --> 21:13.305
It was so sweet
of your father to do that.

21:13.305 --> 21:17.309
He really loves you,
doesn't he?

21:17.309 --> 21:18.810
(chuckles)

21:18.810 --> 21:21.313
You have no idea.

21:26.585 --> 21:28.587
âª Hey, baby, I hear the blues
a'callin' âª

21:29.087 --> 21:31.189
âª Tossed salads
and scrambled eggs âª

21:31.189 --> 21:33.191
âª Quite stylish âª

21:33.191 --> 21:35.627
âª And maybe
I seem a bit confused âª

21:35.627 --> 21:38.697
âª Well, maybe,
but I got you pegged âª

21:38.697 --> 21:40.532
(laughing)

21:40.532 --> 21:42.367
âª But I don't know what to do âª

21:42.367 --> 21:46.371
âª With those tossed salads
and scrambled eggs âª

21:46.371 --> 21:48.874
âª They're callin' again. âª

21:48.874 --> 21:52.778
Thank you!
