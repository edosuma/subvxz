00:52.813 --> 00:55.527
Colin Raimes?
Open the door, please! Police!

00:56.049 --> 00:58.501
Mr Raimes, we have a warrant
to search the house

00:58.554 --> 01:01.796
and remove property in compliance
with the Criminal Evidence Act.

01:30.608 --> 01:32.407
Smack his face in!

01:34.375 --> 01:37.513
This is gonna look very bad
on your arrest report, Colin.

01:53.592 --> 01:56.618
Interview commenced at 11.19 a.m.

01:58.231 --> 02:00.832
The suspect will state his name.

02:04.256 --> 02:05.643
<i>Colin Raimes.</i>

02:05.852 --> 02:07.962
Also present
are the suspect's lawyer...

02:08.007 --> 02:10.452
psychiatrist and social worker.

02:11.041 --> 02:13.172
Look at these photos, Colin.

02:13.741 --> 02:14.895
Lauren Chester.

02:16.543 --> 02:18.682
Murdered in November last year.

02:19.696 --> 02:21.672
Kidnapped, no sexual assault...

02:21.762 --> 02:24.228
starved and held for 30 hours.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.504
Strangled with bootlace.

02:27.725 --> 02:29.516
- You're upsetting him.
- Bettina Mitchell.

02:29.575 --> 02:30.873
Attacked last Saturday.

02:31.007 --> 02:34.377
You said: "Fight me
and you will end up like Lauren."

02:36.689 --> 02:39.477
This is the ID picture
that Bettina gave us.

02:41.478 --> 02:44.173
This... is your diary.

02:44.256 --> 02:45.883
We found it in your room.

02:46.351 --> 02:48.547
From the diary, quote:

02:48.651 --> 02:52.529
"I killed her. She's been killed.
I'm a killer, an ace killer."

02:52.736 --> 02:55.441
That particular entry
is not awash with ambiguity.

02:55.524 --> 02:57.163
Dated November 4th.

02:57.639 --> 02:58.976
The day after the murder.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.737
Colin's a first-rate fantasist.

03:00.811 --> 03:03.444
So let's talk about
the night of the abduction, Colin.

03:03.859 --> 03:05.506
November 2nd.

03:05.797 --> 03:08.305
Hold on. November 2nd?

03:08.938 --> 03:09.923
That's correct.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.581
He was at our drop-in centre.

03:13.862 --> 03:16.640
Some kids had thrown fireworks at him.
He was distressed.

03:16.743 --> 03:18.796
We brought him to the centre.

03:19.117 --> 03:20.526
I think we're done.

03:24.456 --> 03:26.075
<i>Colin Raimes.</i>

03:26.549 --> 03:28.717
Colin Raimes isn't our man.

03:28.863 --> 03:30.706
We'll go back
to our best lead.

03:31.588 --> 03:33.952
The fibres found underneath
the fingernails of the victim.

03:34.026 --> 03:35.321
Definitely synthetic.

03:35.384 --> 03:37.601
I think there's more
to be had from Raimes.

03:37.788 --> 03:38.597
Let's lean on him.

03:38.691 --> 03:41.261
What, and be sued for harassment
of a schizophrenic?

03:41.738 --> 03:44.091
He's a fantasist.
It's in his psych evaluation...

03:44.164 --> 03:45.491
Screw his psych evaluation!

03:45.584 --> 03:47.948
You used to believe in gut feeling.
What happened?

03:48.052 --> 03:49.017
Nothing.

03:49.420 --> 03:51.660
Sam, what is going on in there?

03:52.635 --> 03:55.350
Look, I can't think
about this now. Ok?

04:03.695 --> 04:06.037
I'm gonna stand you down
from the case, Maya.

04:06.959 --> 04:10.183
It's not productive,
given our personal problems.

04:11.045 --> 04:13.418
Look, forget about us.

04:14.049 --> 04:17.531
I have a theory about Raimes.
About why he kept a diary.

04:17.637 --> 04:18.779
I've made my mind up...

04:18.779 --> 04:20.826
Don't you wanna know
what I'm thinking? My feeling is...

04:20.861 --> 04:23.774
Look around you. What use
are feelings in this room?

04:39.987 --> 04:40.723
Maya.

04:41.164 --> 04:42.542
<i>Why are you shutting me out?</i>

04:44.481 --> 04:45.487
What are you doing?

04:46.150 --> 04:48.307
<i>I'm following my feeling, Sam.</i>

04:49.380 --> 04:51.203
<i>I think there's more to Raimes.</i>

04:51.504 --> 04:53.205
<i>I think he's trying
to impress someone.</i>

04:53.276 --> 04:54.583
<i>What if he knows the killer?</i>

04:54.661 --> 04:56.848
Hang on.
If social services find out...

04:56.911 --> 04:58.433
Where are you, Maya?

04:58.496 --> 04:59.710
<i>I'm tailing Raimes.</i>

04:59.770 --> 05:00.959
You're breaking up.

05:01.795 --> 05:02.845
<i>Someone's there.</i>

05:03.200 --> 05:05.936
<i>Raimes is heading up toward
Satchmore Road. I'm gonna go and...</i>

05:06.032 --> 05:08.531
Maya, no.
Listen, I'll send back-up.

05:08.666 --> 05:10.313
<i>- Ah!</i>
- Maya!

05:33.807 --> 05:36.523
Preserve the scene,
call in SOCO please.

05:37.964 --> 05:40.898
Whoever the killer is,
he's taken her.

07:40.274 --> 07:42.037
<i>Charge to 200 Joules.</i>

07:43.275 --> 07:44.784
<i>Stand clear.</i>

07:47.744 --> 07:49.278
<i>Where are you?</i>

09:12.350 --> 09:14.456
What happened?

09:15.995 --> 09:17.883
Did you not see the signs?

09:19.602 --> 09:21.662
Do you remember
what happened, Sir?

09:21.810 --> 09:24.809
Sir, can you tell me
what happened?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.595
This...

09:29.571 --> 09:31.745
This is not my car. I was...

09:32.616 --> 09:33.888
I was driving a Jeep.

09:33.967 --> 09:35.890
You were driving
a military vehicle?

09:38.825 --> 09:39.867
Hang on.

09:40.348 --> 09:41.963
What's going on?

09:43.175 --> 09:46.759
It says here you on transfer
from C Division in Hyde.

09:47.229 --> 09:49.174
Detective Inspector.

09:50.113 --> 09:52.174
I'm a DCI.

09:53.443 --> 09:55.013
What the hell are you?

09:57.404 --> 09:59.338
I need my mobile.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.481
Your mobile what?

10:02.178 --> 10:03.414
Phone!

10:03.643 --> 10:06.871
860 to Alpha...
Hang on Sir, come back.

10:07.031 --> 10:09.652
860...
Sir, come back!

11:45.566 --> 11:47.328
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

12:17.560 --> 12:19.254
DC Chris Skelton.

12:23.713 --> 12:24.971
Plod's bringing in your stuff.

12:25.051 --> 12:27.363
One of the girls
will sort out your RTA.

12:29.412 --> 12:32.423
Don't sweat it if you've had
a couple of stiff ones.

12:34.049 --> 12:36.791
Blimey. you look like
you've ten rounds with Big Henry.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.588
Someone needs to take
a look at you, boss.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.443
You're as white
as a ginger bird's arse.

12:42.169 --> 12:45.247
There's that nice little plonk
on the next floor. Cartwright.

12:45.328 --> 12:48.304
- Oh aye. She can kiss it better.
- Shut up.

13:04.513 --> 13:07.362
I don't know who the hell
you lot think you are...

13:08.429 --> 13:10.409
But this is my office.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.365
Here.

13:13.751 --> 13:17.104
This is a door, right here.

13:17.494 --> 13:20.045
And my desk is here.

13:21.912 --> 13:23.319
Where's my desk?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.159
Chair?

13:29.971 --> 13:32.055
- PC terminal?
- Who?

13:32.329 --> 13:34.115
You want a constable up here?

13:34.588 --> 13:36.557
What the bloody hell
is going on here?

13:37.233 --> 13:39.224
This is my department!

13:40.071 --> 13:41.594
What have you done with it?

13:41.927 --> 13:43.666
Keep it down, boss.

13:46.505 --> 13:47.832
Too late.

14:04.317 --> 14:05.164
Ok.

14:06.216 --> 14:07.317
Alright.

14:09.491 --> 14:10.763
Surprise me.

14:11.803 --> 14:14.756
What year is it supposed to be?

14:16.644 --> 14:18.351
Word in your shell-like, pal.

14:22.563 --> 14:23.776
Big mistake.

14:24.265 --> 14:25.250
Yeah?

14:25.533 --> 14:27.206
What about this?

14:29.862 --> 14:31.505
They reckon you got concussion.

14:31.557 --> 14:34.417
I couldn't give a tart's furry cup
if half your brains are falling out.

14:34.476 --> 14:39.135
Don't ever waltz into my kingdom
acting king of the jungle.

14:39.255 --> 14:42.621
- Who the hell are you?
- Gene Hunt, your DCI, and it's 1973.

14:42.678 --> 14:45.584
Almost dinner time.
I'm havin' 'oops.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.210
<i>It's funny.</i>

14:47.291 --> 14:49.784
<i>I could have sworn
I left it here. Remember.</i>

14:49.877 --> 14:53.391
<i>Lock your car. Check the doors,
the windows, the boot.</i>

14:53.460 --> 14:55.773
<i>And please,
take the keys with you.</i>

14:56.596 --> 14:59.058
<i>Watch out,
there's a thief about there.</i>

15:12.932 --> 15:14.488
<i>Operator?</i>

15:14.934 --> 15:15.759
What?

15:16.229 --> 15:19.295
- <i>Operator.</i>
- No, I want a mobile number.

15:19.387 --> 15:21.780
- <i>What?</i>
- A mobile number.

15:21.894 --> 15:24.389
0770-913...

15:24.491 --> 15:26.668
<i>Is that an international number?</i>

15:27.421 --> 15:28.121
No.

15:29.163 --> 15:32.711
I need you to connect me
to a Virgin number.

15:32.780 --> 15:33.773
Virgin Mobile...

15:33.854 --> 15:36.741
<i>Don't you start that sexy business
with me, young man.</i>

15:36.820 --> 15:38.948
<i>I can trace this call.</i>

15:49.842 --> 15:51.283
<i>Let's get a second line in.</i>

15:51.355 --> 15:53.790
<i>It's an emergency
and cross-match blood down.</i>

15:53.985 --> 15:56.125
<i>He's slipping
into unconsciousness. Sam?</i>

15:56.217 --> 15:58.644
<i>Can you hear me? Sam?</i>

16:10.280 --> 16:11.565
Just had a shout.

16:11.603 --> 16:14.339
That bird who went missing
a couple of days ago?

16:14.463 --> 16:17.268
She's only been done in
down Satchmore Road.

16:17.428 --> 16:20.954
Satchmore?
That's where Maya...

16:21.172 --> 16:23.759
- Susie Tripper?
- Yeah.

16:23.988 --> 16:26.231
Wrung her neck
like a Christmas turkey.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.398
Right.

16:34.445 --> 16:37.055
I've gotta get down the pub
and give the papers a statement.

16:37.089 --> 16:39.515
if I don't get a move on,
they'll all be half-cut.

16:39.584 --> 16:42.208
So, you're a senior officer,
you're in charge.

16:46.556 --> 16:47.506
Boss?

16:48.712 --> 16:50.269
Shall we make a start?

16:58.989 --> 17:01.725
Susie'd been dead for a couple
of hours when she was found.

17:01.804 --> 17:03.864
No sign of sexual assault.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.714
This is what she had on her.

17:17.601 --> 17:18.952
Bloody hell.

17:23.578 --> 17:26.027
So, then, boss?

17:26.748 --> 17:28.396
Anything you wanna...?

17:32.174 --> 17:33.903
Right. Yeah, uh...

17:37.520 --> 17:39.029
Have you...

17:39.340 --> 17:42.167
visited the... the crime scene ?

17:42.301 --> 17:43.788
What, where she was found?

17:43.881 --> 17:45.712
Yeah, where she was found.

17:47.012 --> 17:50.331
Have you...
preserved the crime scene?

17:50.420 --> 17:51.843
Body's on the slab.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.771
Body should have been
dusted for prints on site.

17:54.805 --> 17:57.242
How the hell are you
gonna get dabs off skin?

18:02.102 --> 18:04.723
You're so right.
How can you?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.242
What's the matter with me?

18:07.597 --> 18:10.866
We did take some prints off a...
a shoe, I think it was.

18:10.902 --> 18:12.551
They've been sent down
to Scotland Yard,

18:12.586 --> 18:14.434
so we should hear back
in a fortnight or so,

18:14.470 --> 18:15.678
if there's a match.

18:15.942 --> 18:17.303
A fortnight?

18:18.608 --> 18:20.920
Motive doesn't seem
to be robbery.

18:21.023 --> 18:24.124
There's 27p in her purse,
plus a couple of green shields.

18:24.828 --> 18:26.790
Well, he might have taken the notes.

18:26.848 --> 18:28.744
I mean,
who's gonna take 27p?

18:28.828 --> 18:30.064
Well, I would.

18:32.907 --> 18:34.424
After pub closing time,

18:34.425 --> 18:37.617
she stayed in the car park with
a couple of fellas, but that's cool.

18:37.895 --> 18:39.604
Cool, is it? Why?

18:39.678 --> 18:42.325
Well, we know 'em. Loaders
from canal wharf. They're alright.

18:42.473 --> 18:44.740
Now she was in the car park,

18:44.900 --> 18:48.250
and she was giving them
Downhill Racer...

18:53.886 --> 18:56.208
So you're not gonna
take statements?

18:59.058 --> 19:00.604
It's not them, boss.

19:12.251 --> 19:13.660
Wake up.

19:13.746 --> 19:17.057
He didn't shag her.
He didn't rob her.

19:17.210 --> 19:19.572
So what's the motive?

19:29.763 --> 19:33.481
Garrotted with a... thin cord.

19:33.542 --> 19:35.562
No other attack marks,

19:35.630 --> 19:38.690
nothing in or around the mouth.

19:40.269 --> 19:42.985
What have you learnt
from the stomach contents?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.195
Well, er...

19:49.318 --> 19:52.903
Chris, have a look.

20:01.456 --> 20:03.698
In the file,

20:03.935 --> 20:06.347
in the post-mortem file.

20:09.642 --> 20:14.108
She wasn't fed for at least a day
before she was killed.

20:20.518 --> 20:23.965
And she was found
in Satchmore Road.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.894
Come on!

20:28.945 --> 20:30.983
Enough! Come on!

20:31.053 --> 20:32.717
Stop it now! Enough!

20:32.887 --> 20:36.963
Stop! End!
Finish! Come on!

20:39.885 --> 20:41.210
Okay!

20:42.042 --> 20:43.706
Walls wet, er...

20:45.116 --> 20:47.935
I can smell
the preserving agent,

20:49.260 --> 20:52.420
soap in the tray, er...

20:52.574 --> 20:55.136
Ham sandwich, half-eaten...

20:58.703 --> 21:01.931
I can hear somebody
whistling outside.

21:07.076 --> 21:09.419
You need to get some rest, boss.

21:25.333 --> 21:28.508
You just need a large Scotch
and a bit of a kip.

21:40.229 --> 21:41.605
It's him.

21:42.627 --> 21:44.513
He's killed before.

21:44.580 --> 21:48.554
We'll er... get a plonk
to give you the once over.

21:49.556 --> 21:51.628
No broken bones then.

21:51.731 --> 21:53.904
Do you feel like
you're gonna heave up?

21:55.008 --> 21:56.943
I feel a bit nauseous.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.306
You'll do.
You've had hangovers worse.

22:02.685 --> 22:04.213
Are you a doctor?

22:04.348 --> 22:07.168
I'm about as qualified
as Doctor Kildare.

22:07.254 --> 22:09.172
I'm part of the
Women's Department.

22:09.223 --> 22:11.534
- The what?
- Don't you have plonks in Hyde?

22:12.009 --> 22:15.015
Go on, sir.
Off you jolly well trot.

22:20.704 --> 22:22.215
What now?

22:24.678 --> 22:25.867
What's your name?

22:25.868 --> 22:29.339
- WPC Cartwright.
- No, first name.

22:30.681 --> 22:31.919
Annie.

22:34.565 --> 22:38.845
I was <i>four</i> in 1973, Annie.

22:41.647 --> 22:42.887
Hit me.

22:42.972 --> 22:44.484
Don't tempt me.

22:44.603 --> 22:45.688
Go on.

22:47.608 --> 22:50.836
- You've been in an accident.
- Hit me.

22:58.650 --> 23:01.521
- Shit!
- I'm sorry, sir.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.866
Hey, good girl.
Prostate probe and no jelly.

23:06.243 --> 23:09.367
Why don't you call it a day, Tyler?
Chris'll drive you to your place.

23:10.336 --> 23:13.580
- My... place?
- Yeah, they gave us an address.

23:13.988 --> 23:15.855
Unless, of course, you're...

23:16.059 --> 23:18.402
getting a bit of a taste
for it in here, hmm?

23:22.240 --> 23:24.177
This guy kills,

23:24.313 --> 23:27.438
then, what,
he waits another thirty years?

23:27.844 --> 23:32.090
Is that why I'm here,
because that's when he first struck?

23:32.514 --> 23:34.332
Does that make sense?

23:34.775 --> 23:36.319
Yeah. Loads of sense.

23:36.370 --> 23:39.409
Maya thought
that Raimes knew the killer.

23:39.495 --> 23:42.892
Colin Raimes!
No, no, he'd still be in nappies.

23:42.994 --> 23:44.998
I can take him home.

23:45.388 --> 23:47.358
Take him. He's yours.

23:49.923 --> 23:51.469
This is Neil.

23:53.293 --> 23:54.702
Sam.

23:55.739 --> 23:57.301
Can you hear me?

23:58.931 --> 24:00.001
Sam?

24:02.956 --> 24:04.145
What?

24:07.083 --> 24:09.425
Do you want me to take you home?

24:13.878 --> 24:15.255
Help me.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.251
This is it.

24:34.805 --> 24:36.453
Oh my God.

24:38.117 --> 24:40.393
It's not so bad, is it?

25:03.760 --> 25:07.327
<i>Mr Enoch Powell has called
for an increase in taxation</i>

25:07.395 --> 25:09.280
<i>to deal with inflation.</i>

25:09.415 --> 25:11.803
<i>Mr Powell called
for an autumn budget...</i>

25:13.037 --> 25:15.322
I'm not mad. I'm not.

25:22.530 --> 25:24.363
I had an accident.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.904
And I woke up
33 years in the past.

25:27.989 --> 25:30.792
Now, that either makes me...

25:31.249 --> 25:35.155
a time-traveller or...
a lunatic,

25:35.375 --> 25:36.468
or...

25:37.870 --> 25:42.777
I'm lying in a hospital bed in 2006
and none of this is real.

25:45.026 --> 25:47.405
33 years in the future?

25:47.523 --> 25:49.816
That's where
you're saying you're from?

25:49.987 --> 25:52.416
See, Maya - that's my girlfriend -

25:52.551 --> 25:55.064
she's been kidnapped
by the same killer

25:55.167 --> 25:57.748
who strangled
Susie Tripper yesterday.

25:57.867 --> 26:01.723
I think you should go to a hospital and
ask them to check you for concussion.

26:01.808 --> 26:04.184
He'll hold her
for a day, and then...

26:05.307 --> 26:08.821
Don't you see?
It's the same killer in both times.

26:08.958 --> 26:12.338
Paranoid delusion,
brought about by the accident.

26:12.576 --> 26:15.463
It's not concussion.
It's psychological.

26:15.565 --> 26:18.298
Pretty fancy words for a WPC.

26:19.573 --> 26:22.461
I studied psychology at university.

26:23.105 --> 26:26.076
I'm just saying,
I think it's a medical thing

26:26.162 --> 26:28.455
and you should sign off sick
and see somebody.

26:28.523 --> 26:33.176
What if you're my mind
telling me this is real?

26:33.634 --> 26:36.419
You'll have to work
this one out on your own.

26:37.438 --> 26:38.660
Thanks.

26:39.196 --> 26:40.810
You know, for...

26:41.388 --> 26:45.853
listening to what I had to say and then
not calling the men in the white coats.

26:47.893 --> 26:50.168
DI Tyler,

26:51.016 --> 26:54.465
you don't seem like the rest of them,

26:54.974 --> 26:58.948
and you're clever enough to know
that what you're saying can't be true.

27:20.790 --> 27:23.286
Yes, it's beating.

27:27.278 --> 27:30.014
- I have to go.
- Where?

27:30.085 --> 27:32.651
What do you care?
I'm not real.

27:32.719 --> 27:36.119
As soon as I walk out that door,
poof, I'm gone.

27:36.203 --> 27:37.513
Here I go.

27:39.110 --> 27:41.201
Ready, steady...

27:55.494 --> 27:57.349
Get some rest.

28:07.651 --> 28:11.406
<i>In module 3, we noted that the
collective pythagorian angles</i>

28:11.475 --> 28:15.843
<i>embedded in our X-to-N ratio could be
derived from the simple numenary "A"</i>

28:15.929 --> 28:20.058
<i>as the constant 10
and depicted thus.</i>

28:24.435 --> 28:28.430
<i>But what concerns us most
is regulating his breathing.</i>

28:28.599 --> 28:31.983
<i>That is why we have to keep
the endotrachial tube in place.</i>

28:32.068 --> 28:35.196
<i>I have to stress to you that
Sam is in low responsiveness,</i>

28:35.281 --> 28:38.188
<i>but is not in a persistant
vegetative state.</i>

28:38.239 --> 28:41.706
<i>although he has suffered
a severe cranial trauma.</i>

28:41.842 --> 28:45.582
<i>But the Glasgow scale does put him
at a deep level of coma.</i>

28:46.789 --> 28:47.775
Hey!

28:48.117 --> 28:49.968
You're talking about me!

28:50.138 --> 28:52.434
I'm here, I can hear you,
look at me, I'm here!

28:52.485 --> 28:55.785
<i>At times, however,
he moves. Murmurs.</i>

28:55.886 --> 28:59.303
<i>Has motor response as though
caught up in some sort of...</i>

28:59.387 --> 29:02.515
<i>deep REM sleep
from which he cannot wake.</i>

29:02.582 --> 29:05.422
<i>Well, this gives us some hope,
despite the brain-stem bruising.</i>

29:06.782 --> 29:08.449
Hey! I'm here!

29:08.786 --> 29:12.679
Look at me, does this look like
low responsiveness to you?! I'm here!

29:12.968 --> 29:14.143
<i>Sam?</i>

29:15.950 --> 29:18.534
- I can hear you, I can hear you!
- <i>Sam Tyler?</i>

29:23.158 --> 29:25.638
Wait! No!

29:25.929 --> 29:29.244
Wait, don't leave me,
I'm in BUPA!

29:29.686 --> 29:31.860
Please don't leave me!

29:35.651 --> 29:37.913
No, please, I'm here!

29:38.347 --> 29:40.998
Don't leave me here!

29:46.914 --> 29:49.872
Please don't leave me!

30:21.385 --> 30:23.986
Bloody hell, I've seen
road accidents more cheerful.

30:24.106 --> 30:26.723
Where are you today,
here or planet of the Clangers?

30:26.842 --> 30:28.935
Didn't know
if you were gonna show, boss.

30:29.206 --> 30:30.905
Where else could I go?

30:31.739 --> 30:33.235
Well, we're honoured.

30:33.318 --> 30:35.496
Right, we've pulled a bird in,
Dora Keynes.

30:35.546 --> 30:37.824
She was the last person
to see the victim alive.

30:38.946 --> 30:41.785
- Is she a suspect?
- No, just a pain in the arse.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.228
OK. Alright.

30:49.162 --> 30:50.591
Brief me in full.

30:50.659 --> 30:53.668
- What do I need to know?
- She's a pain in the arse.

30:53.770 --> 30:56.729
What, so you've handed her in
to Lost Property?

30:56.796 --> 31:01.012
Well, we could use the canteen,
but she's a right mouthy bird, this one.

31:02.084 --> 31:03.394
Hang on.

31:03.864 --> 31:05.529
You're gonna do the interview in there?

31:05.597 --> 31:06.872
Thick walls.

31:09.779 --> 31:11.004
Okay.

31:18.415 --> 31:22.205
You had a drink with Susie
the night she died, didn't you, Dora?

31:22.613 --> 31:25.469
I know you.
From the picket line.

31:25.597 --> 31:27.119
You put the boot
into my old man.

31:27.193 --> 31:29.292
- Oh, happy days.
- Sod off.

31:30.583 --> 31:31.884
Can't, love.

31:33.048 --> 31:36.216
This is my esteemed colleague,
DI Tyler.

31:39.728 --> 31:40.894
Hi, Dora.

31:41.911 --> 31:44.269
- I want you to call me Sam.
- You really a copper?

31:45.595 --> 31:46.748
Possibly.

31:48.408 --> 31:50.285
When was the last time
you saw Susie?

31:50.383 --> 31:51.833
In me dreams.

31:56.338 --> 31:58.377
How did she seem, that night?

31:58.548 --> 32:01.739
Did she - did she mention
meeting anyone?

32:01.813 --> 32:02.758
She was horny.

32:02.820 --> 32:06.000
Did she get into an argument
with a... stranger.

32:06.589 --> 32:08.085
You know the answer.

32:09.314 --> 32:11.167
It's blowing in the wind.

32:15.193 --> 32:17.329
I'm done with this game.
Let's play another.

32:17.389 --> 32:21.000
Let's play hopscotch or pin the tail
on the donkey, you pick, Dora.

32:21.050 --> 32:21.824
I want a lawyer.

32:21.883 --> 32:24.265
I wanna hump Britt Ekland,
what are we gonna do?

32:48.978 --> 32:50.857
Your dad's waiting
to take you home.

32:58.286 --> 33:00.187
What the hell
did you do to her?

33:00.447 --> 33:02.362
Well, you know.
The usual.

33:02.460 --> 33:05.197
Then banged her up
for obstruction. Kids, eh?

33:06.349 --> 33:09.035
Where I come from,
you'd be looking at suspension.

33:09.515 --> 33:11.800
Really, what,
for making a breakthrough?

33:12.058 --> 33:15.076
At 11.20, she saw Susie Tripper
heading away from the pub,

33:15.164 --> 33:17.374
followed by a tall bloke
with long hair.

33:19.142 --> 33:22.688
The hair under those nails
is not human, it's synthetic.

33:23.007 --> 33:26.187
Yeah. Chris told me
what happened in the mortuary.

33:28.864 --> 33:30.215
I need a drink.

33:32.768 --> 33:35.407
That 's the first sensible thing
you've said since you got here.

33:43.204 --> 33:45.169
Haven't uniform got
their own boozer?

33:45.230 --> 33:46.850
You have to rubber-eel mine?

33:47.672 --> 33:49.931
Ah, DCI Hunt.

33:50.005 --> 33:51.883
Mon brave.

33:54.547 --> 33:56.426
You catching flies, brudder?

33:58.231 --> 34:02.109
Which part of my subconscious
do you hail from?

34:05.228 --> 34:06.652
I like you.

34:06.983 --> 34:08.235
I like you.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.955
Nelson's a good bloke.

34:10.027 --> 34:12.828
- What're your poisons?
- Tan and bitter. Sam?

34:13.858 --> 34:15.184
Diet Coke.

34:19.812 --> 34:22.132
I'm just joking. Pint of bitter.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.606
Give it up then.

34:27.188 --> 34:28.293
Alright.

34:30.774 --> 34:32.331
The man you're looking for

34:32.406 --> 34:35.206
is either wearing
thick gloves of some sort,

34:35.266 --> 34:38.300
or he's using...
a bag, or something,

34:38.360 --> 34:41.663
made of coarse material,
gets under the nails.

34:41.761 --> 34:43.811
You can't know that
from one stiff.

34:44.092 --> 34:46.830
I've seen another.
Look, I'm telling you...

34:50.036 --> 34:52.161
What does it matter anyway?

34:53.288 --> 34:54.884
None of this is real!

34:55.938 --> 34:58.286
You're just some thug...

34:58.371 --> 35:01.023
who crawled out of some
dark little pit in the back of my mind.

35:01.097 --> 35:02.619
Then report me.

35:03.296 --> 35:04.485
See you, Gene.

35:05.258 --> 35:07.014
Give my regards to the id.

35:08.697 --> 35:11.557
Alright! Right now!
Let it be now! Come on!

35:13.763 --> 35:14.858
You're new.

35:15.337 --> 35:17.572
And you've got something big
crammed up your jacksie,

35:17.609 --> 35:19.634
but don't worry,
you'll learn.

35:20.112 --> 35:21.654
I may be the sheriff,

35:21.655 --> 35:23.717
but I'm a deputy to the law.
Now, I don't care...

35:23.765 --> 35:26.268
if you want to take a swing for me
if it makes you feel good,

35:26.323 --> 35:29.209
but what I do ask is that
you don't hide anything from me.

35:29.270 --> 35:32.659
So, have you got
a hunch about this case?

35:35.052 --> 35:39.420
With what I know,
I could find this killer.

35:40.932 --> 35:41.890
Prove it.

35:59.545 --> 36:02.294
Look for these leads cropping up
in any box in the room..

36:02.566 --> 36:03.817
Priority.

36:03.916 --> 36:05.498
Priority. Will call.

36:06.088 --> 36:08.374
So where did you get
these names from?

36:08.482 --> 36:10.999
Call it inspiration.

36:21.585 --> 36:23.929
To predict what this killer
might do next,

36:23.979 --> 36:26.828
we have to understand
what he's thinking and feeling.

36:27.589 --> 36:28.571
Annie?

36:29.429 --> 36:31.297
You're familiar
with this case, aren't you?

36:33.052 --> 36:34.132
Yes, sir.

36:34.561 --> 36:36.894
Could you help us
out here, please?

36:44.752 --> 36:47.869
WPC Cartwright
has a BA in psychology.

36:50.853 --> 36:53.026
Now the victim wasn't gagged.

36:53.271 --> 36:54.953
Why didn't he gag her, Annie?

36:55.259 --> 36:56.733
Forget the mind-reading act.

36:56.916 --> 36:58.893
Let's get down to the strip-tease.

37:04.270 --> 37:07.891
Because he needed to...

37:10.566 --> 37:12.666
He needed to see a mouth.

37:13.195 --> 37:14.422
The lips.

37:15.356 --> 37:17.467
We have to see
the things that we value.

37:18.118 --> 37:20.133
Now put yourselves
in the mind of this man.

37:20.978 --> 37:22.132
You're lonely.

37:23.528 --> 37:27.175
Every night,
you dream of this girl...

37:27.606 --> 37:30.834
and she's got big eyes,
and red, ruby lips.

37:30.931 --> 37:33.411
So you go out and
you find that girl,

37:34.037 --> 37:35.424
and you bring her home.

37:36.099 --> 37:37.291
But you don't gag her,

37:37.352 --> 37:39.782
'cause you want to see those ruby lips.

37:41.219 --> 37:44.558
But you just can't
bring yourself to kiss 'em.

37:44.989 --> 37:46.326
You get embarrassed.

37:47.602 --> 37:48.841
Angry.

37:49.013 --> 37:51.358
You'd start to blame the girl.

37:51.492 --> 37:52.708
It's her fault.

37:52.819 --> 37:54.797
She's taunting him just by being there.

37:54.870 --> 37:56.820
And then one day,
you just snap.

37:58.099 --> 38:00.675
Strangle her,
using bootlace,

38:00.749 --> 38:04.186
and then the cycle starts
all over again, with a different girl.

38:04.370 --> 38:05.722
And this time,

38:06.218 --> 38:08.729
you're positive you're gonna be
brave enough to kiss her.

38:08.803 --> 38:10.028
Only you won't be.

38:11.589 --> 38:13.762
I look at your lips
all the time, Cartwright.

38:13.836 --> 38:15.383
D' you think
I should turn myself in?

38:17.837 --> 38:20.107
I think you'd better
trot along now, sweetheart,

38:20.158 --> 38:22.222
before I have to hose
this lot down.

38:22.355 --> 38:23.239
Yes, sir.

38:23.609 --> 38:24.515
Thank you.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.278
How would he keep her quiet
without gagging her?

38:27.622 --> 38:28.825
I don't know.

38:29.262 --> 38:30.169
Alright.

38:30.218 --> 38:32.479
Maybe this nutter
moved to the area recently.

38:32.528 --> 38:34.970
Maybe he's on day release
from the loony bin.

38:35.032 --> 38:37.057
Maybe there's a new face
in the local boozers,

38:37.106 --> 38:40.507
let's find out, let's not wait
for another skirt to wind up dead.

38:41.494 --> 38:44.039
And let's just hope we haven't been
led up a blind alley.

38:51.470 --> 38:54.759
Sorry sir, I've checked and
there's no Maya Roy listed in that area.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.098
Then try the number again.

38:56.159 --> 38:58.000
I have no Maya Roy listed.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.744
Well, just try again!

39:00.061 --> 39:01.779
- There's no need...
- Forget it.

39:04.924 --> 39:06.605
Large whisky, please.

39:08.373 --> 39:10.460
Drink ain't gonna fix things.

39:10.914 --> 39:12.339
What am I saying?

39:12.424 --> 39:13.739
I run a pub!

39:13.824 --> 39:15.689
Of course it'll fix things!

39:19.623 --> 39:21.171
I'm lost, Nelson.

39:22.545 --> 39:23.847
Really lost.

39:27.265 --> 39:29.007
You're not lost, pal.

39:29.547 --> 39:30.985
You're where you are

39:31.709 --> 39:33.452
And you have to make
the best of it.

39:34.062 --> 39:35.733
It's all you can do.

39:39.554 --> 39:41.474
Keep it to yourself, eh?

39:41.611 --> 39:44.864
Folks just seem happier
with the other Nelson.

39:54.750 --> 39:56.285
Good luck.

40:16.363 --> 40:18.726
Look at this. These are my notes
from the real world.

40:18.803 --> 40:20.322
I made them last night.

40:20.414 --> 40:23.285
Films. Music. Wars.

40:23.359 --> 40:25.186
Just check out the detail.

40:25.385 --> 40:28.763
Don't tell me.
Atom bombs over Moscow.

40:29.344 --> 40:31.893
Discussing psychology
with your little friend?

40:36.753 --> 40:40.513
I want Chris out of the collators den.
It's a waste of flipping time.

40:40.589 --> 40:42.143
No it isn't.

40:42.297 --> 40:44.158
Sorry, did that sound
like a question?

40:44.254 --> 40:47.324
- I can find this killer.
- Do you know what?

40:47.516 --> 40:49.682
I think you're trying
to show me up.

40:51.715 --> 40:55.072
You don't scare me, Hunt.

40:55.878 --> 40:59.619
It's an interesting point you raise.
Allow me to retort.

41:05.298 --> 41:06.639
Better?

41:15.735 --> 41:17.691
Where are you going?

41:18.268 --> 41:20.300
I can't deal with this place.

41:20.415 --> 41:22.391
So you're just giving up?

41:23.368 --> 41:24.482
Look...

41:25.151 --> 41:28.951
Somewhere out there,
Maya needs me.

41:29.718 --> 41:32.999
My mind can only invent
so much detail, you know,

41:33.154 --> 41:36.988
so I'm gonna walk til
I can't think up any more faces,

41:37.164 --> 41:38.655
or streets.

41:38.868 --> 41:41.722
I mean, this is just...

41:55.150 --> 41:56.652
Just what?

41:59.523 --> 42:01.272
This is madness.

42:04.479 --> 42:05.998
I've got a nephew,

42:06.367 --> 42:08.592
and he fell off a pier,

42:08.669 --> 42:11.231
and he couldn't remember
the name of things.

42:11.400 --> 42:14.888
Couldn't tell you
what an apple was, or a pencil.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.286
And you know what?

42:16.604 --> 42:18.536
He stopped believing in them.

42:19.504 --> 42:21.422
Then he got better.

42:21.912 --> 42:24.206
And everything seemed real again.

42:30.378 --> 42:32.470
Follow the yellow brick road.

42:33.826 --> 42:36.407
And what will you find?

42:36.551 --> 42:39.204
Mist? A big cliff?

42:39.304 --> 42:40.818
White door?

42:42.680 --> 42:43.876
I don't know.

43:01.340 --> 43:02.983
I used to come here!

43:05.306 --> 43:06.963
I bought my first...

43:08.202 --> 43:11.506
Gary Numan. <i>Cars</i>.

43:24.339 --> 43:26.344
I'm gonna call DCI Hunt.

43:28.534 --> 43:30.279
What's he gonna do?

43:31.087 --> 43:32.919
Throw me down the stairs?

43:33.540 --> 43:35.862
Say I walked into a door?

43:37.132 --> 43:39.353
He don't want me around,
and he doesn't need me.

43:39.424 --> 43:41.372
And I certainly don't need him.

43:42.252 --> 43:43.131
Sam?

44:00.727 --> 44:02.197
What are you doing?

44:03.047 --> 44:04.664
He doesn't gag 'em.

44:05.770 --> 44:08.644
He doesn't gag 'em 'cause he wants
to kiss 'em, but if they shout out,

44:08.716 --> 44:11.573
he's gonna get caught, in't'e,
so what's he gonna do?

44:12.597 --> 44:17.759
Strands of material
underneath their nails...

44:18.625 --> 44:20.240
and on their skin.

44:20.398 --> 44:21.942
But it's not wool.

44:22.173 --> 44:25.187
It's rough. Synthetic.

44:29.050 --> 44:31.414
I know where the fibres come from.

44:31.602 --> 44:32.959
Soundproofing!

44:34.084 --> 44:37.487
He's trying to muffle the room
to hide the cries.

44:37.774 --> 44:40.761
Dora Keynes' coat was found
on rough ground, what, an hour ago?

44:40.833 --> 44:42.044
Yes, guv.

44:42.095 --> 44:43.482
Sleeve was torn.

44:43.663 --> 44:47.828
She was last seen shouting at some bloke
loitering in the street, about 9.40pm.

44:47.949 --> 44:50.912
So, stuff the collators office,
we need to get out on the street

44:50.993 --> 44:53.957
because by your reckoning,
we only have a day to find her.

45:03.152 --> 45:04.855
Anything happens to this motor

45:04.935 --> 45:08.019
and I come over your houses
and stamp on all your toys, got it?

45:08.800 --> 45:10.063
Good kids.

45:14.568 --> 45:16.492
Hello, love. CID.

45:19.777 --> 45:21.939
We're looking for this woman,
Dora Keynes.

45:22.039 --> 45:28.108
Approximately 5'2'', curly brown hair,
hazel eyes, fake topaz necklace.

45:31.874 --> 45:35.578
We're looking for a short skinny bird,
wears a big coat, lots of gob.

45:37.442 --> 45:40.146
Excellent work,
ladies and gentlemen.

45:48.358 --> 45:49.879
Hunt, what?

45:49.939 --> 45:54.847
<i>I need to speak... Tyler... told me
to let him know... name from his list.</i>

45:54.966 --> 45:57.390
Chris, move about a bit.

45:57.490 --> 46:00.813
<i>Tell DI Tyler we've found one
of his names in the collators office.</i>

46:00.875 --> 46:02.458
<i>We've found one!</i>

46:04.298 --> 46:07.182
It's one of the names
you asked me to find. Raimes.

46:07.904 --> 46:09.705
I only found the carbon.

46:10.826 --> 46:13.029
It's a statement she made
three months ago.

46:13.190 --> 46:15.314
Woman in her fifties.
Mrs Raimes.

46:15.375 --> 46:16.567
Beryl Raimes.

46:16.831 --> 46:19.581
You gave the name Colin Raimes,
so I thought there was a connection.

46:19.663 --> 46:21.584
Yeah. she's his grandmother.

46:22.150 --> 46:25.677
Oh, that's lovely.
What nice boys you are.

46:25.737 --> 46:27.380
Do you want a custard cream,
Mrs Raimes?

46:27.459 --> 46:29.761
- Ooh, ta.
- Mrs Raimes.

46:29.921 --> 46:33.408
You made a complaint to the police,
about three months ago?

46:33.467 --> 46:37.372
I saw a lady policeman.
Nice girl.

46:37.493 --> 46:39.656
No life for them, is it?

46:39.798 --> 46:41.442
You came to complain
about a neighbour.

46:41.483 --> 46:42.893
That's why we have
a statement from you on file.

46:42.993 --> 46:45.936
The only trouble is,
we don't know who it was,

46:45.997 --> 46:49.581
or what it was about
because our copy got smudged.

46:49.721 --> 46:52.525
- Have you got Garibaldis?
- Chris, Garibaldis!

46:52.605 --> 46:57.411
It's only three months ago, Mrs Raimes.
Think back. Please. Think hard.

46:57.473 --> 46:58.759
I forget stuff.

46:58.830 --> 47:01.599
Mrs Raimes, it's very important.
It could be vital that you remember

47:01.680 --> 47:04.343
exactly why you came
to see us three months ago.

47:04.463 --> 47:08.951
Was it a next-door neighbour
who you were worried about,

47:09.049 --> 47:12.435
or somebody in your street,
somebody visiting,

47:12.494 --> 47:14.717
someone upset you.
They did something bad,

47:14.757 --> 47:17.561
or selfish, or dangerous.

47:17.721 --> 47:19.664
Please, come on, think.

47:19.807 --> 47:21.627
Pink wafers.

47:22.069 --> 47:24.151
I love pink wafers.

47:24.291 --> 47:26.953
You know, all of those packets
of wafers you get at Christmas.

47:27.073 --> 47:28.752
Ooh, they are lovely.

47:28.847 --> 47:30.745
- Expensive, mind.
- They are, aren't they?

47:30.746 --> 47:32.743
I sometimes get them in
for my grandson.

47:32.803 --> 47:34.921
I bet that takes a bite out
the housekeeping, eh?

47:34.975 --> 47:37.495
Chris, run down the canteen,
see if we've got any pink wafers.

47:37.567 --> 47:38.771
Now, guv?

47:39.192 --> 47:41.555
Hang on.
Sorry, is this helping?

47:41.655 --> 47:44.379
- Do you want another cuppa?
- Grand.

47:45.381 --> 47:48.204
Don't you go worrying yourself
about this neighbour business.

47:48.324 --> 47:50.909
It's not important at all.
Sugar, love?

47:51.410 --> 47:54.633
The lad next door.
Number twenty.

47:54.713 --> 47:56.817
Oh yeah?
What about him, my love?

47:56.978 --> 47:59.181
Oh, he's playing
his record player all night.

47:59.301 --> 48:03.467
Bash! Crash! Bam!
And he's not even local.

48:03.545 --> 48:05.389
So that's why you came to see us.

48:05.489 --> 48:08.193
To complain about
the noise from his stereo.

48:08.293 --> 48:12.338
It did the trick, pet.
He still lives there,

48:12.478 --> 48:15.643
but you can't hear a thing now.

48:22.115 --> 48:25.120
Back-up to 20 Kemmel Road, now!

48:26.021 --> 48:28.886
<i>The suspect is an Edward Kramer.</i>

48:28.985 --> 48:31.348
We may need uniformed back-up,
have you got that?!

48:31.490 --> 48:33.572
You will tread carefully.

48:33.914 --> 48:36.136
We don't even have a warrant yet.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.301
Pipe lagging.

49:02.742 --> 49:06.227
- Kramer! Police!
- Whoa, what you doing?

49:12.595 --> 49:15.619
Dora? Dora?

49:15.940 --> 49:18.926
Dora, it's alright,
it's police,

49:19.126 --> 49:21.668
we're the police,
it's okay, love, we've got you.

49:24.234 --> 49:25.976
Kramer, come here!

49:54.177 --> 49:56.202
Get inside, Colin.

50:16.989 --> 50:18.753
That's Raimes' house.

50:19.515 --> 50:22.016
Maya was right,
he knew the killer.

50:23.338 --> 50:25.902
We were one house away.

51:02.105 --> 51:04.500
Kramer'll never go to trial,
you know that, don't you?

51:04.568 --> 51:06.370
- He's certifiable.
- Nah.

51:06.451 --> 51:09.414
Jury'll send
that creature down forever.

51:10.637 --> 51:15.161
This is a doctor's report.
We found it in the house.

51:15.282 --> 51:18.787
It says he is "seriously disturbed".

51:18.866 --> 51:21.432
He's going to
a high-security hospital.

51:23.293 --> 51:27.881
What, and be mollycoddled,
indulged, be a good boy,

51:27.921 --> 51:31.806
he'll be out in twenty years.
He'll still only be forty odd.

51:31.906 --> 51:35.632
You know as well as I do,
he'll kill again.

51:36.493 --> 51:38.016
Hang on.

51:43.223 --> 51:45.204
Oh my God.

51:48.349 --> 51:50.371
That's why he doesn't kill
for so long.

51:50.452 --> 51:53.035
We put him away in hospital,
he gets out in 30 years,

51:53.156 --> 51:54.739
and then he kills.

51:55.339 --> 51:56.942
And then he kidnaps Maya.

51:57.023 --> 51:59.766
What are you on about?
Forget the bloody doctor's note.

51:59.844 --> 52:03.630
If the jury know they're trying
a cold-blooded killer, it's life.

52:04.292 --> 52:08.497
Look, listen, you told me
you were a deputy to the law.

52:08.578 --> 52:13.164
The law is putting bad people away
and you wanna show a court that note?

52:15.548 --> 52:18.973
Fine. You got principles.

52:25.181 --> 52:26.364
Hang on.

52:26.503 --> 52:28.666
What, you want
another pop at me?

52:28.886 --> 52:32.691
You wanna get me suspended?
If you like, you can try your hand.

52:33.092 --> 52:36.516
And as for this note,
I'm making it your call.

53:17.073 --> 53:18.975
Welcome to the team.

53:20.056 --> 53:23.160
Thanks. Guv.

53:29.579 --> 53:31.583
I'll get the lights, love.

53:36.448 --> 53:38.513
Are you okay, sir?

54:00.190 --> 54:01.490
<i>Sam.</i>

54:02.352 --> 54:04.153
Can you hear me?

54:05.357 --> 54:07.539
My name is Neil.
I'm a hypnotherapist.

54:07.659 --> 54:10.124
I'm speaking directly
to your subconscious.

54:10.245 --> 54:13.267
At this moment,
I'm sitting beside you in your bed,

54:13.387 --> 54:16.954
in the IC ward
of St James's Hospital.

54:17.535 --> 54:20.218
If I am reaching you...

54:21.221 --> 54:25.906
and you can hear me, then
I know that you can wake up.

54:27.430 --> 54:29.070
I can hear you.

54:32.455 --> 54:34.579
I'm in a coma, yeah?

54:36.473 --> 54:37.696
You can help me.

54:37.776 --> 54:41.480
Whatever you may be
experiencing isn't real, Sam.

54:41.600 --> 54:43.364
You can escape.

54:44.304 --> 54:47.829
You only need
to take that definitive step.

54:48.369 --> 54:49.852
Do as I tell you

54:49.971 --> 54:53.957
and you will be waking up with
your family and friends around you.

54:54.117 --> 54:58.583
Your mobile
hasn't stopped ringing.

54:59.744 --> 55:01.547
Maya is here.

55:01.647 --> 55:04.053
- Maya.
- She's safe.

55:04.311 --> 55:07.195
If you can hear me,
I know that will give you strength.

55:16.951 --> 55:19.214
I'm coming back.

55:21.456 --> 55:23.099
You tell her.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.863
I'm coming back.

55:44.066 --> 55:45.324
Sam?

55:46.640 --> 55:48.843
Come away from the edge.

55:49.845 --> 55:54.372
It's okay. I know the answer.

55:54.592 --> 55:56.252
I'm in a coma.

55:56.353 --> 55:59.457
I'm gonna take the definitive step
I need to wake up.

55:59.580 --> 56:01.462
Neil's my ex.

56:02.221 --> 56:04.545
He did psychology with me.

56:04.725 --> 56:07.209
I told him all about you.

56:07.309 --> 56:10.212
He read all those notes you made.

56:10.512 --> 56:13.797
There was nothing in those notes
about a mobile phone.

56:13.898 --> 56:15.240
What?

56:15.340 --> 56:17.943
This is just my mind,
trying to keep me here.

56:18.186 --> 56:21.387
He's just playing games with you.

56:23.377 --> 56:26.484
Look down. Carefully!

56:26.844 --> 56:28.946
<i>Please don't jump!</i>

56:29.046 --> 56:32.271
Sorry! I'm sorry! Bad joke!

56:32.492 --> 56:36.496
Please, no, Sam, don't do it!

56:43.987 --> 56:45.344
What you doing?!

56:45.405 --> 56:48.349
We all feel like jumping
sometimes, Sam.

56:48.470 --> 56:50.092
Only we don't.

56:50.652 --> 56:52.815
Me and you, because we're not cowards.

56:52.915 --> 56:55.139
This is just my mind.

56:55.479 --> 56:57.963
Maybe you're here for a reason.

57:00.365 --> 57:02.650
To make a difference.

57:06.534 --> 57:08.838
Gimme your hand.

57:29.506 --> 57:32.029
What's that on your hands,
is that grit?

57:32.730 --> 57:34.313
Sand.

57:34.773 --> 57:39.701
I was running up here
and I fell against the fire bucket.

57:43.786 --> 57:46.051
See, why would I imagine that?

57:46.152 --> 57:50.337
Why would I bother to put
that kind of detail in it?

57:50.599 --> 57:52.179
You wouldn't.

58:01.012 --> 58:03.015
What should I do, Annie?

58:07.542 --> 58:08.763
Stay.
