00:02.440 --> 00:04.396
- <i>Previously on</i> The O.C.<i>:</i>
- Where's my brother?

00:04.560 --> 00:07.074
- Trey's looking at three to five years.
- You like Seth Cohen!

00:07.240 --> 00:09.754
I can't like Seth Cohen. 
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.592
What have you two been doing?

00:11.760 --> 00:15.594
Kiki tells me you've been in the office
alone together till 2 in the morning.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.036
Aren't they the perfect couple? They've
been keeping their romance a secret...

00:19.200 --> 00:22.351
...but tonight, the secret's out.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.435
Mom, no recipes. Put them away.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.750
This is Ryan's first Thanksgiving
in the house...

00:28.920 --> 00:31.229
...and we're gonna
make this meal as a family.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.630
- Seriously, where's Rosa?
- No Rosa. Just us.

00:33.800 --> 00:36.678
- I, for one, am ready for this challenge.
- Dad, takeout menus.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.115
- Sandy!
- You sure you wanna do this?

00:39.280 --> 00:41.714
Mom, no. No!
We're not ruining Thanksgiving!

00:41.880 --> 00:44.997
- Who said we are?
- I wait for this event every year.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.390
Please!
Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.074
- Everyone knows this.
- My family was never into holidays.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.356
All the more reason to make this special.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.990
- Are there any pans anywhere?
- Not inspiring a lot of confidence, darling.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.470
Know what I dream about when I dream
about Thanksgiving, which is often?

00:59.640 --> 01:02.393
I dream about eating
so much deliciousness...

01:02.560 --> 01:05.313
...that all the blood rushes
to my stomach and I pass out.

01:05.480 --> 01:08.153
- Please don't deny me that.
- That's just weird.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.198
Well, I guess we should start
with the turkey.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.509
Do I...?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.509
That's just how she held you as a baby.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.159
Sandy.

01:24.120 --> 01:26.680
I guess we should just start basting?

01:28.160 --> 01:30.674
- Tell you what, I'll baste.
- That's a good idea.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.718
- Are you sure?
- Oh, I love to baste, you know that.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.314
Okay. Well, next up is cranberries.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.314
- I got it. Big fan of the cranberry.
- Then I'll peel the potatoes.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.109
You know what? There's few things as
therapeutic as peeling a potato. I'm sorry.

01:44.280 --> 01:47.113
- So, what am I supposed to do?
- Set the table.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.191
Yeah. Setting the table's important.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.032
- How about I get the phone?
- Or you can answer the phone.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.918
You own the phone.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.469
Hello?

01:59.200 --> 02:01.555
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.878
Yeah, he's right here.
Hold on a second.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.676
Ryan, it's your brother.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.153
I'm just gonna...

02:18.440 --> 02:20.670
He's...
He's calling from jail.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.990
Well, he's gonna be there for a while.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.390
- Hey, did you ever meet him?
- No.

02:25.560 --> 02:30.953
It's just that I've gotten used to Ryan
in the family. You forget he has his own.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.998
Hey, bro.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.112
Good. You?

02:41.680 --> 02:44.956
What, today? It's Thanksgiving, Trey.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.957
No. Yeah, I know.
It's been a long time. It's just...

02:54.600 --> 02:56.716
Wasn't Mom gonna see you?

02:59.760 --> 03:00.954
Okay.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.030
No, I wanna see you too.

03:04.200 --> 03:07.237
It's been too long, so...

03:10.080 --> 03:11.229
You too.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.594
Bye.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.308
How's Trey?

03:19.480 --> 03:21.914
Okay. He was hoping I could visit him.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.236
Holidays. He doesn't wanna be alone.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.148
Can you blame him?

03:28.320 --> 03:30.788
So are you gonna go?

03:30.960 --> 03:33.679
Well, it's only an hour away.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.990
I could help out here, go down,
be back by dinner.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.515
Great. That'll be great.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.558
You get to see your brother.

03:43.000 --> 03:49.074

04:16.399 --> 04:18.038
People actually make stuffing?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.757
What did you think?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.512
I didn't.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.028
So you should probably
be heading out soon.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.596
I gotta finish the stuffing.
Then there's the gravy and candied yams.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.594
And if you find enough cooking to last
three to five years, then Trey'll be out.

04:37.240 --> 04:39.959
He's just gonna want something
from me. A favor, money.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.429
Maybe not. Maybe he just wants
to see his family.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.194
- You don't know Trey.
- I know. You never talk about him.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.749
Not a lot to talk about.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.115
He's your brother.

04:50.280 --> 04:54.398
But if you want, I'll go with you.
I'd like to meet him.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.471
No, you wouldn't.

04:57.400 --> 05:00.312
Well, legally, Ryan,
we're all, like, brothers now, so...

05:00.480 --> 05:03.438
Someone has to keep
your mom away from the food.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.876
Besides, you've got Anna coming over.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.472
Yes, I do.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.317
- You think Ryan's okay?
- I think he'll be okay.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.278
- He needs to do this.
- Okay.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.512
- Let me get in there, do some flipping.
- No. Seth really likes corn.

05:20.680 --> 05:23.353
- How do you expect me to get better?
- I don't!

05:23.520 --> 05:25.670
- Sorry. The boys and I made a pact.
- A pact?

05:25.840 --> 05:27.558
- A solemn promise.
- When?

05:27.720 --> 05:30.792
You were in the bathroom.
I'm all for you expanding your horizons.

05:30.960 --> 05:34.748
But not today. We have guests, who
expect that food will actually be served.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.832
Speaking of which,
did you tell Rachel about Jimmy?

05:38.000 --> 05:40.389
- No. Did you tell Jimmy about Rachel?
- No.

05:40.560 --> 05:44.269
He's freaked out enough.
First Thanksgiving without his wife.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.954
Well, I bet he'll have
less indigestion this year.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.714
Unlike your father,
who will probably be in agony.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.998
I can't believe he is having
Thanksgiving with Julie Cooper.

05:54.640 --> 05:58.394
- Because he's never had it with us.
- Well, no complaint here.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.074
Mom, you're uncomfortably close
to the corn right now.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.754
Can we just back up a little bit?

06:06.640 --> 06:08.631
I should have just gone to Grandma's.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.030
Because I really don't wanna go
to Mom's.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.428
It's just for an hour.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.909
Why do we have to
spend Thanksgiving with him?

06:15.080 --> 06:16.957
He's creepy.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.839
Caleb's not creepy, he's just...

06:22.080 --> 06:24.469
- Scary.
- He's dating Mom.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.076
- I'm well aware.
- Well, isn't that weird for you?

06:28.240 --> 06:31.596
Look, your mom is... She's moving on.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.069
But I got news for you,
so's your dad.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.037
Really?

06:36.200 --> 06:38.156
Well, not exactly.

06:38.320 --> 06:42.438
I mean, there's the fraud charges
and the whole bankruptcy thing.

06:42.600 --> 06:47.116
You know, I don't even have a job,
so I'm not exactly a catch, but...

06:47.280 --> 06:49.669
Feel free to disagree.

06:49.840 --> 06:53.992
Look, I know it's weird, all right?
But your mom is still your mom.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.599
She loves you.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.469
Come on.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.750
- Better get on the road.
- Just one second.

07:02.920 --> 07:04.194
Trey doesn't even read comics.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.476
Not yet, but he hasn't seen
the new <i>Titans</i>.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.155
<i>Titans</i>. What about <i>Legion</i> ?
That was kind of cooler.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.233
The guy's in prison, man.
Have you seen <i>Oz</i> ? I'm sure that'll be fine.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.119
But, yeah, the new <i>Legion</i> is cooler.

07:22.440 --> 07:23.998
Hey! Hey!

07:24.160 --> 07:26.594
Easy on my eau de toilette, please.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.955
Since when did you start
wearing cologne?

07:30.160 --> 07:33.436
I'm sorry for trying
to step it up a notch.

07:34.480 --> 07:38.268
- Since today.
- Oh, right, because Anna's coming over.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.271
What?

07:40.440 --> 07:43.591
No. Why would you...?
Why would you even wear...?

07:43.760 --> 07:45.830
Anna? Are you totally...?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.639
I don't even... I don't. I couldn't. No.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.631
- You like her.
- What makes you think that?

07:50.800 --> 07:53.360
What's the problem?
She's cool. She's into you.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.514
Okay, I need to ask your advice
on something...

07:57.680 --> 08:01.116
...but you have to promise me
that you will not tell anybody.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.554
- Promise?
- Promise.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.109
The other night,
on my grandfather's yacht...

08:05.280 --> 08:08.033
...Summer attacked me with her lips.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.589
And she swore if I told anyone,
she would kill me.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.228
- She's got an interesting take on romance.
- Yeah.

08:13.400 --> 08:17.029
So the first 16 years of my life,
I have no women, now I have two.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.998
- Yeah, I feel really bad for you.
- Hey, thanks, buddy.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.151
Seriously, man, tough problem to have.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.596
I liked it so much better
when you had no sense of humor.

08:28.280 --> 08:31.113
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Welcome.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.510
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

08:33.679 --> 08:36.399
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- You look very nice.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.109
Just wanted to stop by
before I went to my mom's.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.748
See if you wanted to talk.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.558
Your pool house or mine?

08:44.720 --> 08:48.793
- It's a twist-off, so that's classy.
- You've outdone yourself.

08:48.960 --> 08:52.669
- So Thanksgiving. Big day. Excited?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.400
- New shirt?
- I guess.

08:55.560 --> 08:58.028
- Yeah, it's a tuck-in.
- Apparently.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.634
And you wore your hair like... Like this.

09:00.800 --> 09:05.396
I... Yeah. I wasn't aware that...
Do I wear my hair any way?

09:05.560 --> 09:08.472
What's going on? It's just us, right?

09:08.640 --> 09:12.474
- Hey, I'm a fan of the tuck-in.
- And your hair looks good.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.637
- I gotta go. My mom's waiting.
- Okay.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.349
- I'll be back in, like, an hour.
- Great. I should be back by 8.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.875
- Where are you going?
- To see my brother.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.110
- I thought he was in...
- He is.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.837
But he called.
He wants me to drive down to visit him.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.436
- You want company?
- No, it's okay.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.597
You don't want to...

09:42.760 --> 09:46.469
No, I wanna see where you're from,
where you lived.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.513
You should be with your mom.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.880
You have this whole life
I don't know anything about.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.632
- It's better that way.
- No, it's not.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.279
Yes, it is.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.350
Look, it's...
It's not my life anymore.

10:04.400 --> 10:07.358
So, what does it matter, right?

10:21.280 --> 10:24.590
- Rachel!
- Hi! Happy Thanksgiving.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.957
- Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you.
- So sweet.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.678
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.831
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.552
Well!

10:37.440 --> 10:40.910
So this is the summer cottage
for weekend getaways?

10:41.080 --> 10:43.833
That means "nice house" in Rachel.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.472
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm Jimmy. We met...

10:50.640 --> 10:52.392
- Yeah, at La Roca.
- Right.

10:52.560 --> 10:57.111
Right. Great. Jimmy, Rachel.
Hey, why don't you both have a seat.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.672
Okay.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.632
Okay, well... I have to
check on something in the kitchen.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.472
As do I.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.999
- We suck!
- That was not very smooth.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.355
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- No, you didn't.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.636
I don't wanna know, don't care.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.629
Okay, so I'm gonna take off.

11:29.800 --> 11:30.949
Hey.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.590
Just in case, take this.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.671
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.912
- Want anyone to go with you?
- No, I'm okay.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.310
Okay, well, you should take the keys.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.109
And I have a little something for Trey.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.192
- Don't worry, it's store-bought.
- Nice.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.430
- Later on, buddy.
- All right.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.438
What, too much? Hey, seriously.
Did I put too much on?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.710
Did you guys hear that Ryan's funny now?

12:19.760 --> 12:22.035
- What are you doing?
- I'm coming with you.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.310
My mom said it was okay.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.314
She did?

12:28.480 --> 12:32.393
Yeah, well, she's trying to
stay on my good side these days.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.835
I don't know.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.877
I do.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.752
Thanks.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.913
Hey, little brother.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.308
Hi.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.156
This is Marissa.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.357
Good to see you, man.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.434
You know what? You guys talk.

13:55.320 --> 13:57.788
I'll just be over here.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.956
Look at you, man.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.030
Sorry I haven't come by to see you.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.795
You've been busy. Mom said
you'd done pretty good for yourself.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.315
- How you been?
- You know. Not so good.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.317
- What do you need?
- Don't say it like that.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.869
- Can't a guy just see his brother?
- You tell me.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.871
Hey, forget about it, all right?

14:34.760 --> 14:38.753
I didn't wanna have to call you,
but I'm in trouble.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.437
When we got arrested,
I owed some people a lot of money.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.115
- Money that I lost, like, 6 grand.
- How'd you lose 6 grand?

14:46.280 --> 14:48.669
I'm an Atwood, bro. You know our luck.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.029
The people that I owe it to...

14:52.960 --> 14:55.872
...they got friends in here
who like to remind me about it.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.114
It's only gonna get worse.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.909
- I don't have that kind of money.
- I'm not asking you for the money.

15:05.080 --> 15:06.752
So, what are you asking me for?

15:10.440 --> 15:13.477
- You can't tell me where we're going?
- Bus station. You're going home.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.315
- What? Ryan...
- I have to pick up a stolen car, okay?

15:17.480 --> 15:20.677
That I have to drop off
at some chop shop to pay back a debt.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.350
- A stolen car.
- Now you know why you're not coming.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.080
- But if you get caught...
- He's my brother.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.672
If I don't do this...

15:30.800 --> 15:33.234
I've got no choice, okay?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.111
Me either.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.475
I'm not leaving you.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.554
Can you believe
Seth has a girl coming over?

15:50.720 --> 15:52.995
- I know!
- How can I help?

15:53.160 --> 15:55.549
- Hi.
- You must be Anna. Sandy Cohen.

15:55.720 --> 16:00.191
- Nice to meet you.
- We're doing fine, just working away.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.114
If by "we" you're referring to yourself,
then somebody violated the pact.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.589
I'm opening the wine,
a skill I feel confident about.

16:06.760 --> 16:09.638
- No argument here.
- So, Anna, what's the deal?

16:09.800 --> 16:13.475
Your parents don't believe in celebrating
the genocide of the American Indian?

16:13.640 --> 16:15.995
They went to Pittsburgh
to have dinner with the rest of the clan.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.993
- Oh, you didn't wanna go?
- No.

16:19.160 --> 16:24.393
It's kind of challenging to sit at a table
with the Sterns and still have an appetite.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.155
It's sort of an anathema
to the whole spirit of Thanksgiving.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.276
<i>Anathema? Anathema.</i>

16:33.560 --> 16:36.028
- Yes.
- Hey.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.829
Sweet potatoes and marshmallows and
cornflakes. Suddenly not so hungry.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.798
Well, then, all you'll be eating
are your words.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.635
Seth, a little help, please.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.710
You're trying to set me up
with Jimmy Cooper.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.757
- That's crazy.
- Yes, it is.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.990
- He's a white-collar criminal.
- But a nice one.

17:12.160 --> 17:16.438
How desperate do you think I am?
Don't answer that.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.715
- Look, Jimmy's a good guy.
- He's a thief.

17:18.880 --> 17:22.270
And you're a lawyer.
It's a perfect match.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.838
You don't wanna deal
with what's going on between us.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.754
There is nothing going on between us.
We're coworkers and friends. That's it.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.276
- Jimmy's cool, he's funny, he's attractive.
- It's not happening, Sandy.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.315
- Okay, admit it.
- Admit what?

17:41.480 --> 17:43.516
This whole thing is a setup.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.592
Should I use orange candles
or brown candles?

17:48.120 --> 17:50.111
Just say it.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.311
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:08.760 --> 18:11.399
I didn't know about the, you know...

18:11.560 --> 18:12.879
Oh, me neither.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.874
Okay, I just wanted to...
Wanted to make that clear.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.268
Good.

18:19.160 --> 18:21.196
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.989
- Oh, come on, break that tackle, baby.
- No, kill him. Kill him!

18:25.320 --> 18:30.030
- Hit him! Hit him!
- He could go all the way!

18:33.160 --> 18:34.479
<i>Touchdown</i>!

18:34.640 --> 18:37.108
- Dolphins fan.
- Huge. You're a Cowboys fan?

18:37.280 --> 18:38.759
Obsessed.

18:38.920 --> 18:40.831
- We've got a game here.
- Yeah, we do.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.839
- I don't want it.
- Why not?

18:50.000 --> 18:54.278
- It's two-week-old gravy.
- It's not, I just made it.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.959
Do you ever watch ESPN Classics?

18:58.120 --> 19:00.031
Oh, my God, I love ESPN Classics.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.555
There's something about it. It's so...

19:02.720 --> 19:05.792
...soothing.
- Soothing. Yes, it's totally soothing.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.951
I don't know what that is.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.117
The gruesome twosome!

19:14.280 --> 19:17.158
That means "Happy Thanksgiving"
in Sandy.

19:17.320 --> 19:20.357
Our caterer's truck broke down
with our entire Thanksgiving feast.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.398
- I wanted to tell Marissa we're eating out.
- She's not here.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.269
Or we could just eat here.
You don't mind, do you, Kiki?

19:27.440 --> 19:31.035
- No. Why would I mind?
- Football's on, I forgot.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.239
- Cal, please, make yourself at home.
- Why not? It's mine.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.513
I don't understand. If Marissa's
not here, where is she? With Ryan?

19:40.680 --> 19:43.319
He went home. He left this morning.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.918
- Julie.
- Jimmy.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.798
Rachel.

19:50.800 --> 19:54.110
Rachel, Jimmy. What's the score?

20:11.240 --> 20:14.152
So this is your old neighborhood.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.716
Ryan Atwood.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.154
Theresa, hi.

20:28.840 --> 20:29.955
Arturo in?

20:30.120 --> 20:32.315
You're just gonna ask
for my stupid brother?

20:32.480 --> 20:35.552
You're not gonna tell me where
you've been for the last five months?

20:36.520 --> 20:38.590
No... Yeah...

20:40.960 --> 20:43.633
- Who's this?
- Hi. I'm Marissa Cooper.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.953
So this is your new girlfriend.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.000
- Oh, so you two were...
- Off and on.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.549
We grew up together.
I was the girl next door.

20:54.440 --> 20:55.919
So am I.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.557
- Yeah. Arturo?
- Yeah, he's here.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.157
I'll explain later.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.997
Mom, look who I found.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.479
Ryan!

21:20.360 --> 21:23.033
Where have you been?
I haven't seen your mom in a while.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.679
Yeah, me neither.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.559
- And your brother?
- That's kind of why I'm here.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.154
- So you're here for the car?
- Hey, man.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.918
- Hey, man, how you been?
- This is Marissa.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.274
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.192
His girlfriend.

21:37.920 --> 21:41.230
Come on, man, let's go. Might take us
a minute to get the engine going.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.278
- You wanna come?
- You go. I'll hang out here.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.995
- You could help us cook.
- Great.

21:51.160 --> 21:55.153
Mom, don't ask her to help. I'm sure she
doesn't cook. She's got maids for that.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.396
- I don't know where she is.
- So you lost her.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.949
She's supposed to be at your house.
You lost her.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.588
Third and long. Big play.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.228
- They can't stay.
- I know.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.029
Julie's gonna blow our Jimmy/Rachel
thing. All our hard work for nothing.

22:16.200 --> 22:21.069
- Who does he think he is?
- Oh, you leaving? It was good to see you.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.595
- Hey, Seth.
- Hey there, Gramps. Remember Anna?

22:23.760 --> 22:26.149
- How could I forget?
- All right.

22:28.240 --> 22:32.119
Kiki, I know you're upset with me.
Perhaps we should talk.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.398
It's okay, Dad. I'm not upset
with you anymore. No talk needed.

22:36.960 --> 22:38.359
Not so fast.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.193
You own the Heights, right?
The property above the wetlands?

22:41.360 --> 22:42.839
- Not you too.
- I was wondering...

22:43.000 --> 22:45.434
...how do you feel about
building a development...

22:45.600 --> 22:47.955
...that only pollutes and destroys
hallowed ground?

22:48.120 --> 22:50.680
Oh, that's quite a message
you're sending the youth.

22:50.840 --> 22:54.799
Has she read my report? Is she aware
of the estuary we're building?

22:54.960 --> 22:56.871
Everybody knows
that doesn't go far enough.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.237
- It's a Band-Aid for a bullet wound.
- Oh, really?

23:00.400 --> 23:02.550
Tell you what, I'll get that.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.751
Summer. Hi. What are you doing here?

23:08.920 --> 23:12.276
I'm trying to have Thanksgiving. I was
supposed to meet Marissa at her house.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.317
There was no way
I was eating with my stepmom.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.436
Why does she need tryptophan?
She's on Valium.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.593
Oh, yeah. Well, some of the Coopers are
here, but I don't know where Marissa is.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.228
Well, while I'm here,
maybe we should talk.

23:23.400 --> 23:28.269
- Yes. What should we talk about?
- About what didn't happen on the yacht.

23:28.440 --> 23:31.432
So are you gonna invite me in?

23:31.600 --> 23:35.275
Know what? Let's discuss this in the
pool house. That's gonna work for me.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.759
Also, let's go around front...

23:36.920 --> 23:40.356
...because we put some new gardenias in,
and I think you'll be impressed.

23:43.680 --> 23:47.559
That's weird, because they said those
gardenias should have been in bloom...

23:52.240 --> 23:53.878
Hey, what's going on?

23:54.040 --> 23:57.077
I just can't help it.
And I certainly can't explain it.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.912
- You didn't tell anyone?
- No.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.469
- Because I'll kill you.
- No, I believe you.

24:05.120 --> 24:09.398
Could you wait one second? I've got some
green beans I really need to go check on.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.074
You're passing me up for beans.

24:13.240 --> 24:14.798
No.

24:21.800 --> 24:23.358
Is this Ryan?

24:24.040 --> 24:25.234
You mean Snoopy?

24:25.400 --> 24:28.915
That's from the eighth-grade musical.
<i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown</i>.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.310
Theresa was Peppermint Patty.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.711
- And Ryan was Snoopy.
- He was so talented.

24:34.880 --> 24:38.555
- Ryan did musicals?
- He quit when we got to high school.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.191
That's a really pretty dress.

24:42.360 --> 24:45.955
Yeah, that's when me and Ryan
went to the winter dance last year.

24:46.120 --> 24:49.157
That was a crazy night.
We used to get in all kinds of trouble.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.559
He just left. You know that?

24:58.320 --> 25:01.710
He was there one day
and next day his house was empty.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.713
- I don't think he planned any of it.
- He could have called.

25:05.800 --> 25:09.156
You know someone your whole life,
you grow up next to them.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.590
I guess I didn't know him at all.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.073
This car's hot, man.
Gattas will be psyched.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.834
Your brother must owe him
a lot of money.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.753
- That dude's crazier than your brother is.
- Yeah.

25:26.160 --> 25:29.516
So why are you back here
doing Trey's bitch work?

25:29.680 --> 25:32.478
Look, Trey was my best friend.
But the guy's trouble.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.596
I've noticed.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.637
You don't have to do this.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.315
You could just go back to your new life.
What's Trey gonna do?

25:43.280 --> 25:45.555
Let's just get this thing running.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.200
You've been trying to get him
to Thanksgiving for years.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.793
The only reason why he is here...

25:57.960 --> 26:01.077
...is because his food didn't show up
and the game is on.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.391
Slow down with that.
You're drinking on an empty stomach.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.994
Don't tell me to slow down.
Tell him to hit the bricks.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.038
- Hit the bricks? Who talks like that?
- Don't judge me.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.760
I have a family that won't let me cook
for Thanksgiving...

26:12.920 --> 26:16.833
...my father's using me for my
candied yams, and we are out of merlot!

26:17.000 --> 26:19.639
Do you want some privacy?

26:21.320 --> 26:23.311
I'll just...

26:29.720 --> 26:32.439
- Hey.
- Anna! Why, hello there.

26:32.600 --> 26:34.511
Where you been?

26:34.680 --> 26:36.875
Ryan asked me to feed
his sea-monkeys.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.032
Ryan has sea-monkeys?
I love those things!

26:40.200 --> 26:43.476
You know what, though? You can't
see them, because they're dead.

26:43.640 --> 26:46.438
Yeah, suicide. You know
how hard the holidays can be.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.152
Well...

26:50.040 --> 26:51.792
...the pool house is empty.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.872
Maybe we could take
some alone time to hang out.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.079
- Yeah, let's do that in my room.
- Even better.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.593
All right!

27:09.240 --> 27:10.639
So.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.315
This is your bedroom?

27:14.480 --> 27:16.198
Yes. Yes, it is.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.518
Have you met Captain Oats yet?
I don't think you have.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.237
Seth...

27:31.960 --> 27:35.509
...you didn't bring me here
to introduce me to Captain Oats.

27:36.200 --> 27:37.474
No, I didn't.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.434
That's what I thought.

27:50.600 --> 27:53.797
I have cauliflower steaming.

27:53.960 --> 27:58.033
So I'll leave you here
with Captain Oats and I'll be right back.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.275
So the car's ready to go.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.238
- Hello?
- <i>Man, it's me. Listen.</i>

28:13.640 --> 28:16.632
Now, despite what the <i>Penthouse</i> letters
might suggest...

28:16.800 --> 28:20.156
...two girls and one guy...
No, it's not really all it's cracked up to be.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.639
I know what you mean.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.950
Can I call you back
when Marissa and I are on the road?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.395
- Marissa's with you?
- Yeah, why?

28:26.560 --> 28:29.597
<i>Her mom 's here looking for her.</i>
<i>Call me back, okay?</i>

28:29.760 --> 28:31.113
Yeah.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.317
- So Marissa's with Ryan.
- What?

28:42.480 --> 28:45.677
- I said, Marissa's in Chino.
- I can't hear you.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.515
I said, Marissa is in Chino!
Wow, that actually happens in real life.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.434
- What did you say?
- Yeah, no, I said Marissa has my chinos.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.831
- I love those pants.
- Looks like we'll be here a while.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.878
- You ready to talk?
- Fresh margs?

29:02.920 --> 29:05.070
So I'll see you again.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.469
- Good luck.
- Yeah. You too.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.198
And, you know...

29:12.520 --> 29:13.873
...sorry.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.236
Me too.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.517
This place isn't as fun as it used to be.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.233
So how come you didn't tell me
there was a Theresa?

29:34.400 --> 29:37.073
How come you didn't tell me
about your mom?

29:38.320 --> 29:41.551
- You're gonna put this on me too?
- I didn't put anything on you.

29:41.720 --> 29:44.996
- Who do you think she's gonna blame?
- I'll explain it to her.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.469
- I shouldn't have brought you.
- You're not doing it alone.

29:47.640 --> 29:50.871
Because you're my wheelman now?
Go back to Newport, I'll take a bus.

29:51.040 --> 29:53.713
- Ryan!
- This is not a conversation.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.757
You lied to me.

30:12.360 --> 30:15.158
What is up with this shirt, Cohen?
Is it, like, childproof?

30:15.320 --> 30:16.673
Well...

30:17.120 --> 30:18.599
...why don't you let me do it.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.274
Oh, way to take charge, Cohen.

30:26.280 --> 30:29.716
- What? Do I have lipstick on my mouth?
- No.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.518
No.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.992
What?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.791
This is happening.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.795
Wait. What do you mean,
this is happening?

30:49.960 --> 30:51.359
No, no, no, Cohen!

30:53.000 --> 30:55.560
You know what?
This can't be happening.

30:55.720 --> 30:59.076
Yes, it can. It just was.
I was just expressing awe and delight...

30:59.240 --> 31:01.993
...which now will be replaced
with a severe bruise on my ass.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.311
I need to think or eat something.
I feel lightheaded. Can we go inside?

31:05.480 --> 31:08.631
No, actually, I think that it's best, then...

31:08.800 --> 31:14.238
...if I go inside, because I'm the host,
and I bring food to you, the guest.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.439
Also, my mom's cooking and that's
something that nobody should witness.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.797
Plus, my dad is wearing an apron.
Same category.

31:21.960 --> 31:25.953
And my grandpa's talking politics,
and nobody likes politics.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.238
And it's very tense, so stay here
where the relaxation is. I'll be back.

31:34.600 --> 31:36.716
This is your fault.
You let her go with Ryan.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.792
- I had no idea she was doing this.
- Well, that's encouraging.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.157
- What sort of father are you?
- You're not serious.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.629
I may be a lot of things,
but never a bad parent.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.870
- Destroyer of the environment.
- Tyrannical land baron.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.349
Stay out of this.
I don't even know what you're doing here.

31:50.520 --> 31:52.511
Oh, she's our guest. Unlike some people.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.274
Oh, so suddenly you have standards
about who comes here.

31:55.440 --> 31:57.556
- What does that mean?
- She wouldn't be in Chino...

31:57.720 --> 31:58.755
...if she hadn't met him.

31:58.920 --> 32:02.117
- Ryan's not the problem.
- It's the tree-hugger that brought him in.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.352
Or the irresponsible parent
trying to get laid on Thanksgiving.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.397
Excuse me for making up for lost time.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.790
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, heat of passion.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.996
Don't expect that to happen very often.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.550
- People, please. Feel free to share.
- Does anyone want another drink?

32:15.720 --> 32:18.188
- Seth! Run out to the pool house...
- Can't talk, gotta go.

32:28.320 --> 32:30.834
Hey, Anna. What's up?

32:31.000 --> 32:33.275
I'm beating Captain Oats at Jenga.

32:34.120 --> 32:39.240
I think it's his lack of opposable thumbs
that give me a certain advantage.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.755
It's getting a little weird in here.

32:41.920 --> 32:46.596
Well, you left me alone for so long,
I guess I was going a little crazy.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.918
Captain Oats is a sore loser anyway.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.756
Have I mentioned that
Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday?

32:56.920 --> 32:58.831
Well, it is.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.270
Aren't you kind of hot in this?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.116
Yes, it is rather balmy.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.753
- Why don't you take it off.
- Why don't we?

33:08.920 --> 33:11.718
I was never a fan of it.
My mom picked it out, I was like...

33:14.280 --> 33:16.840
I mean, wait, that's not true.
I dress myself.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.389
- I got it.
- Pull on this side...

33:19.560 --> 33:22.757
- Don't worry, I got it.
- But that's where my head...

33:24.360 --> 33:26.749
- Seth?
- Okay, that's two bruises today.

33:26.920 --> 33:28.239
Two?

33:28.400 --> 33:31.119
Yeah, the first one was from cooking.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.717
Sweet potatoes just aren't
as sweet as they used to be.

33:35.880 --> 33:39.270
Speaking of which, I've left them
unattended. I'll be right back.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.193
What was that, Captain Oats?
He wants a rematch. Do that.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.036
Do you want a rematch?

33:50.280 --> 33:52.191
Back so soon? Because I was just...

33:55.040 --> 33:58.919
I mean, not...
You're very attractive. For a dad.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.595
Distinguished, but...
Oh, my God.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.911
You Ryan?

34:29.360 --> 34:31.998
This is a hot ride, I'll tell you that.

34:32.159 --> 34:34.389
Hard to believe
your brother could pull it off...

34:34.560 --> 34:38.030
...because he's such
a stupid son of a bitch.

34:39.040 --> 34:42.589
- Yeah, well, what do you think?
- What, huh? What do I think about what?

34:42.760 --> 34:46.275
- You take the car, Trey's off the hook.
- Is that the deal?

34:46.440 --> 34:50.069
- That's what he told me.
- You fellas hear that?

34:51.239 --> 34:54.550
I been waiting six months for this,
and there's something called interest.

34:54.719 --> 34:58.030
- I don't have anything.
- Well, interest needs to be paid! All right?

35:02.880 --> 35:04.518
Get him! Get him!

35:04.680 --> 35:06.079
Go!

35:06.960 --> 35:10.077
- What the hell are you doing?
- I followed you.

35:10.680 --> 35:11.874
Good idea.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.074
The only thing I know about her
is she likes the Cowboys!

35:16.240 --> 35:19.038
When was the last time we spent
Thanksgiving together?

35:19.200 --> 35:22.431
- I have my work, you know that.
- And don't act so innocent.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.795
I know, Dad, but I didn't
plan on this happening.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.679
Look, I get it.
It's a difficult position to be in.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.434
- Anna's so smart and funny.
- Yes!

35:30.600 --> 35:33.478
She's adorable. But Summer is...

35:34.120 --> 35:35.599
- Summer.
- Yeah.

35:36.520 --> 35:39.080
- You can't lead these girls on.
- No, right, I know.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.959
Be a man.
Tell Anna you like Summer.

35:42.120 --> 35:45.829
Right you are. Except, well...

35:46.000 --> 35:51.518
Okay.
Well, then tell Summer you like Anna.

35:51.680 --> 35:54.274
Yeah, again, not so sure.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.589
Something's burning.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.638
Guys, I hate to interrupt you,
but there's...

35:58.800 --> 36:00.518
Oh, my God, my turkey.

36:02.840 --> 36:06.276
- Oh, that is one toasted bird.
- Come on, Mom.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.710
- Where are the takeout menus?
- Is everything okay?

36:14.880 --> 36:17.440
- Fine. Let me meet you upstairs.
- I heard the smoke alarm.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.794
- Summer?
- Anna?

36:18.960 --> 36:20.996
- Seth?
- Seth?

36:22.080 --> 36:25.152
Holy awkward. This is weird.
I wanna explain everything to you guys...

36:25.320 --> 36:27.072
- I kissed you.
- I know.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.151
- I kissed you.
- Also true.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.038
I always knew
you were a late bloomer.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.749
- Thanks, Mom. Don't go.
- Oh, you don't want her to go?

36:34.920 --> 36:37.434
No. I mean yes. I mean yes.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.795
- Nice.
- That was awkward. Finally she's gone.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.839
- Let me tell you something, Summer...
- I don't feel very good.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.314
The car's delivered, the debt's paid.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.517
But I am never doing anything
for you again, you understand?

37:00.680 --> 37:03.717
- I'm sorry, man.
- They could've killed me.

37:03.880 --> 37:07.031
I also know that no one else
would've done this for me.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.797
But I get it. We're done.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.515
- Well, I'll come by to see you.
- Don't.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.228
You've got a chance, little brother.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.870
You gotta leave me behind.
Leave all this behind.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.315
- Take care of yourself.
- Yeah.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.755
Well, you should jet.
You got people waiting for you.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.478
So that was Chino.

38:15.200 --> 38:19.591
I guess I never realized that
when you left, you left people behind.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.839
I never wanna do that again.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.188
You won't have to...

38:30.840 --> 38:32.512
...Snoopy.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.951
So we should watch
a game sometime.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.874
Yeah, yeah. I'd like...
I don't know if I'm...

39:21.560 --> 39:23.391
Well, when you're ready.

39:23.560 --> 39:24.754
Yeah.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.958
That was good.

39:31.880 --> 39:34.440
Oh, thank God. Are you okay?

39:34.600 --> 39:36.352
Yeah, Mom. I'm fine.

39:37.440 --> 39:41.194
- Why didn't you tell me you were going?
- Julie. It's Thanksgiving.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.154
Lo mein?

39:49.640 --> 39:52.029
Hey, man. What are you doing?

39:53.120 --> 39:57.159
- Not lying with Captain Oats.
- Why are you on the floor?

39:57.320 --> 40:00.392
I figured I'd just end up here anyway,
so I cut out the middleman.

40:00.560 --> 40:04.348
- Looks like things went pretty well.
- Yeah, same for you. Nice shiner.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.476
So can we sit with you and Captain Oats?

40:06.800 --> 40:08.916
Yeah. Please.

40:10.280 --> 40:14.114
Hey, nothing says Thanksgiving
like mushu pork. Thanks.

40:16.840 --> 40:19.070
So, what did your brother say?

40:21.360 --> 40:23.396
Goodbye.

40:24.480 --> 40:28.029
- So Chino was...
- It's good to be home.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.875
So, Seth, did you know
that Ryan did musicals?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.759
That's extremely minty of you.

40:42.920 --> 40:46.276
I didn't know they had musicals in Chino.
Or dancing or laughter.

40:46.440 --> 40:50.911
- No one there is as funny as you.
- So we finally agree I'm the funny one.

40:51.080 --> 40:55.551
Look at that. We all learned some
valuable lessons this Thanksgiving.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.631
It's heartwarming.
