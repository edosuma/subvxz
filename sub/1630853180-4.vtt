01:46.439 --> 01:48.149
- Samantha-san!

01:48.233 --> 01:49.859
- You're looking
tan and rested.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.195
Hawaii agrees with you.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.198
- It was fun! Let's all go
together next time!

01:55.281 --> 01:56.032
- Yes!

01:59.077 --> 02:01.162
- Got my second
dohan request of the night.

02:01.246 --> 02:01.538
Going to be a busy week.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.873
- Go get 'em.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.915
- It won't last.
Not at this price.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.006
I'll take it.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.191
- Where are we going?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.012
- Come.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.576
- Whoa.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.706
Shit.

04:35.316 --> 04:36.818
- He is here.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.243
You. Go in.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.093
- Excuse me.

05:03.803 --> 05:06.097
Mr. Adelstein is here.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.606
- Thank you
for accepting my invitation.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.405
You know who I am?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.073
- You're Hitoshi Ishida.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.659
Koichi Tanaka's right hand

05:26.743 --> 05:30.455
and de facto head of
the Chihara-kai crime family.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.171
- Please sit.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.723
- Pardon me.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.249
Excuse me.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.421
- Please.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.593
- I speak Japanese.

06:26.219 --> 06:26.969
- You are my guest.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.515
Let me show you my respect.

06:36.062 --> 06:40.483
So I am told
you are friendly with police.

06:41.776 --> 06:42.527
- Who told you that?

06:42.610 --> 06:47.448
- Like you,
we protect our sources.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.703
I am also friendly with police.

06:52.787 --> 06:56.249
Every week,
they come to my office.

06:56.332 --> 07:00.586
I serve them tea.
We drink together.

07:00.670 --> 07:06.425
But lately,
they will not touch it.

07:06.509 --> 07:10.513
They say they have heard

07:10.596 --> 07:12.765
I am bribing a cop.

07:13.599 --> 07:17.687
"If we accept anything
from you,

07:17.770 --> 07:21.399
it will look like we are
the ones you are bribing."

07:22.400 --> 07:29.198
Meanwhile, my men see the cops
refusing my tea

07:29.282 --> 07:34.370
and think it means
I am informant for police.

07:35.997 --> 07:36.581
- Why would they think that?

07:44.130 --> 07:50.052
- Someone has started a rumor
that, one, makes police think

07:50.136 --> 07:54.473
I am bribing cops, and, two,

07:54.557 --> 07:59.812
makes my men think
I am informant for the cops.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.565
Neither is true,

08:02.648 --> 08:04.692
but the perception

08:04.775 --> 08:06.611
is undeniable.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.117
- And if that perception
doesn't change?

08:13.201 --> 08:15.036
- Then someday soon,

08:15.119 --> 08:17.914
my men will make me

08:17.997 --> 08:22.084
dig my own grave

08:22.168 --> 08:26.547
and shoot me...boom.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.757
in the head.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.553
- Well, that's--
that's a tough spot.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.847
- One of my men tells me

08:34.931 --> 08:39.936
your friends on the force
are very connected.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.064
If you could persuade them

08:43.147 --> 08:45.441
to find the source
of this rumor...

08:47.443 --> 08:52.615
You would have
my undying gratitude.

09:01.249 --> 09:05.002
- What did you tell your boss
about me?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.465
- I saw you on the news,

09:09.548 --> 09:11.968
after the riot,
talking to the cops.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.387
I tell him I know you.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.639
- Well, thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.062
- Dude, I'm a journalist,

09:23.145 --> 09:27.650
so I can't really be seen
doing favors for yakuza.

09:27.733 --> 09:32.321
- Ishida gets information,
you get new source.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.532
Would be good for everyone.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.430
- Seriously?

09:59.807 --> 10:01.434
What?

10:04.061 --> 10:06.105
- You're into Backstreet?

10:06.188 --> 10:09.025
- Backstreet is
the best band in the world.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.694
- Oh, man.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.904
- All right, if you like
this kind of music,

10:13.988 --> 10:15.406
you should check out 'NSYNC.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.532
- 'NSYNC?
- Yes.

10:16.615 --> 10:22.038
- 'NSYNC is imitators.
Backstreet is original.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.336
- This is masterpiece.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.171
- It's a masterpiece?

10:30.254 --> 10:31.922
- 'NSYNC will never have
the guts to do

10:32.006 --> 10:34.717
a song about a man
and a woman doing that.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.593
- Doing what?

10:37.928 --> 10:40.222
- That. Doing that.

10:40.306 --> 10:45.394
- Doing what?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.396
You know?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.565
- Oh, no, that's not
what this song's about.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.693
- It's in the words.
- No, it's not.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.237
That's not what it's about.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.073
- Shut up, gaijin boy.
- It's not about that.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.450
- You know nothing.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.648
- Never got to thank you
for dinner the other night.

11:30.731 --> 11:34.443
- My pleasure.
- Let me pay you back.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.987
You want to learn real aikido?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.990
Come to our house dojo,

11:40.074 --> 11:43.494
learn some old-school
aikijutsu.

11:43.577 --> 11:46.497
- Sure, why not? Katagiri-san!

11:50.793 --> 11:53.796
And the next thing I know,
he starts telling me

11:53.879 --> 11:55.798
that right now
he has this problem

11:55.881 --> 11:59.969
because the cops won't touch
the tea he offers them

12:00.052 --> 12:03.889
because he thinks somebody
is spreading a rumor

12:03.973 --> 12:06.976
trying to make him look
like a police informant.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.310
And he said that

12:08.394 --> 12:10.312
if he doesn't
do anything about it,

12:10.396 --> 12:13.023
that he's gonna get killed.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.986
- He's right.
- And what if he gets killed?

12:17.069 --> 12:20.698
- If Ishida dies,
Tozawa will move in.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.491
He's already
been testing the waters.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.286
- Like the bar
in Kabukicho, right?

12:25.369 --> 12:27.288
- Among other things.

12:27.371 --> 12:27.830
- Such as?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.794
- I gave you the folder.
Any progress?

12:33.878 --> 12:35.254
- I'm working on it.
Today, I'm gonna work on it.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.548
- Work harder.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.970
I'll look into who's spreading
this rumor about Ishida,

12:43.053 --> 12:46.098
but don't write...
both: Anything about it.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.975
- You don't have to tell me
every time.

12:56.775 --> 12:56.859
Whoa.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.696
- Jake, what happened?

13:00.779 --> 13:02.948
- We thought you were dead.
- Oh.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.783
- We were very concerned.
- Oh, thank you.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.702
I appreciate your concern.
I'm okay.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.038
Hey, you guys know that song
by the Backstreet Boys,

13:09.121 --> 13:11.040
"I Want It That Way"?

13:11.123 --> 13:15.336
Is that way--
is that, you know?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.004
- Duh. Of course.

13:17.087 --> 13:19.298
- Everyone knows that.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.551
So what happened?
- I'll tell you later.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.596
- Yes, I'll bring some home.

13:27.223 --> 13:27.932
I promise. I will.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.937
All right... I'm hanging up.
Bye.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.565
What?

13:36.649 --> 13:37.733
- So I know I'm supposed to be

13:37.816 --> 13:39.485
on the Shinjuku arson thing,

13:39.568 --> 13:42.154
but that guy who set himself
on fire in Kabukicho

13:42.238 --> 13:44.156
and the guy who was stabbed
out in the suburbs,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.992
they were both in debt
to the same loan company.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.411
- Tokyo is filled with people
in debt.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.913
Enough with this.
- There's more.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.206
The stabbed guy,

13:52.289 --> 13:55.709
he was speaking to a lawyer
about bringing up a case

13:55.793 --> 13:58.128
against that loan company
right before he was killed.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.549
- Wasn't he killed
by a random yakuza?

14:01.632 --> 14:02.925
- Well, I have a source
that says

14:03.008 --> 14:04.468
it might not have been
so random.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.095
The stabbed guy
was digging around,

14:06.178 --> 14:06.929
asking a lot of questions,

14:07.012 --> 14:08.847
and this is
some of what he dug up.

14:11.141 --> 14:13.602
There's something
worth chasing here, right?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.564
I went and I spoke to the widow
of the burned guy--

14:16.647 --> 14:18.524
- Jake, they have names.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.944
- Mrs. Satomura.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.779
And she played me messages

14:23.862 --> 14:27.366
that they left on their machine
telling the husband

14:27.449 --> 14:28.993
to go kill himself.

14:29.076 --> 14:29.785
Like, they were not subtle.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.335
- There was a story
run a few weeks ago.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.963
A suicide in Machiya.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.482
Here--it says,

15:00.566 --> 15:02.526
"The victim owed the money

15:02.610 --> 15:04.737
"to a consumer
credit loan company.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.864
They made threats."

15:06.947 --> 15:08.240
- Wow.
- What?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.117
- Your memory
is freakishly good.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.328
- Eat more fish. Good for this.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.163
- Huh.
- Listen.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.539
"According to her husband,

15:15.623 --> 15:18.375
"the loan sharks
called every day

15:18.459 --> 15:21.170
encouraging her
to kill herself."

15:22.379 --> 15:23.964
Kurihira! Shinohara!

15:24.048 --> 15:25.341
both: Hai.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.427
Go to the legal bureau
and pull the company's address,

15:28.510 --> 15:30.304
CEO's name,
anything you can get.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.223
- Hai.

15:34.683 --> 15:36.518
- Are you coming, Jake?

15:36.602 --> 15:38.062
- Yeah.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.443
- Hai, hai.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.197
- Hey, thanks
for letting me borrow this.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.365
- Mm-hmm.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.117
- You got any free daytime
this week?

15:52.201 --> 15:55.788
Something I want to talk to you
about, just off campus.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.748
Ooo, mysterious.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.541
- Not mysterious.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.377
Opportunity.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.754
- Sure.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.297
Call me!
- Okay.

16:05.381 --> 16:05.881
- Good night.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.556
- Good night.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.809
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.730
- You think I'm stupid?

16:21.814 --> 16:27.194
I know what you're up to.
Trying to start your own club.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.779
Stealing my girls?

16:28.862 --> 16:30.906
No one makes a move
in this town

16:30.989 --> 16:33.909
without me hearing about it,
bitch.

16:33.992 --> 16:36.412
- Okay, I don't know who
you've been talking to,

16:36.495 --> 16:39.289
but that's ridiculous.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.083
I make a fortune in cash here.
No taxes.

16:41.166 --> 16:45.045
No drama to deal with.
Why would I want the hassle?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.505
Can I go now?

16:49.425 --> 16:50.968
Fucking Malee.

16:51.051 --> 16:55.931
- Mess with my money,
and you'll regret forever.

16:56.014 --> 16:56.056
Bitch.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.310
- She was...

17:01.520 --> 17:03.021
so full of life.

17:12.656 --> 17:18.287
We understand she was
in quite a lot of debt,

17:19.038 --> 17:22.958
that she had fallen behind
in her payments.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.127
- So then...

17:26.795 --> 17:28.839
Hyon-suk deserved to die...

17:29.381 --> 17:31.091
because she owed money
and couldn't pay?!

17:31.175 --> 17:32.468
- No, no...

17:32.551 --> 17:34.344
- My colleague
meant no disrespect.

17:35.512 --> 17:38.599
We want to find the
people who pressured your wife

17:38.682 --> 17:41.018
and hold them accountable.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.772
- Are you Korean too?

17:46.231 --> 17:48.067
- My grandparents
are from Jinhae.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.194
- Jinhae...

17:52.321 --> 17:53.655
- The cherry blossoms there
are famous.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.492
- Yes. They are beautiful.

17:58.452 --> 18:02.039
My wife was from Jinhae.

18:03.832 --> 18:07.878
We used to go all the time.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.718
- Let us help you.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.680
Those guys...

18:19.807 --> 18:20.516
they came to our home.

18:20.974 --> 18:23.101
- In Japanese, if you will.

18:27.523 --> 18:28.023
- They...

18:31.693 --> 18:35.030
went to the beauty parlor
where she worked.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.660
She was so ashamed...

18:40.661 --> 18:42.621
and afraid.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.793
Wait here a moment.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.384
- You speak Korean?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.386
- Good ear.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.554
- I guess we make
a pretty good team.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.139
- Don't be weird.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.315
- A collection letter.

19:11.316 --> 19:15.988
It came a week after Hyon-suk
killed herself.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.032
Even then...

19:19.116 --> 19:21.994
those bastards
wouldn't leave her alone.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.584
- Holy shit.
There's an address.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.251
- It was sent six days ago.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.086
- You think it's still there?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.797
- Thank you very much.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.300
And we are
very sorry for your loss.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.636
- Thank you very much.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.897
- Your Oyabun, Tozawa...

19:54.401 --> 19:55.152
is spreading a bogus rumor

19:55.235 --> 19:58.196
that Ishida is connected
to the police,

19:59.656 --> 20:02.409
in order to divide and
destabilize the Chihara-kai.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.495
Ishida won't take it
lying down,

20:05.579 --> 20:06.830
and then we'll have a war
on our hands.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.042
I can't let that happen.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.795
A rumor like that
wouldn't carry much weight

20:13.879 --> 20:16.298
coming from Ishida's enemy.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.843
But if it came from inside
the Chihara-kai itself,

20:19.927 --> 20:21.136
that's another story.

20:22.179 --> 20:26.642
Meaning your clever boss
has managed to flip someone

20:26.725 --> 20:29.269
in Ishida's camp.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.483
So, who's the mole?

20:36.193 --> 20:40.614
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.044
- You're free to go.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.589
- Hold on.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.216
You release me now, my crew
will think I cut a deal.

20:59.299 --> 21:02.219
- That's not bad.
It would be interesting.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.846
Do you mind? We need the room.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.848
- They'll kill me!
You know it--

21:14.231 --> 21:17.192
- The mole. Who is he?

22:03.655 --> 22:06.074
- Whew.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.077
That gaijin hostess
you have a hard-on for?

22:09.161 --> 22:11.747
Duke says she's looking
to open up another club.

22:12.914 --> 22:16.752
Go talk to her. Make sure
she knows... Everybody pays.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.087
Scare her a little.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.173
- Understood.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.467
- Hey, fuck her all you want,
I don't care.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.262
I see a future for you.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.432
But don't blow it
over some piece of ass.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.104
- That's the popular one,
right?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.148
- Yeah, yeah. That's the one.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.067
- Is it good?

22:40.150 --> 22:41.276
- It's really spacious
and nice.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.114
- Let's go together next time.

22:54.956 --> 23:00.045
- I've gone to the big banks
and the other loan companies.

23:01.379 --> 23:03.840
No one else will lend to me.

23:06.134 --> 23:09.346
I'm desperate.

23:11.848 --> 23:16.937
My husband gambles away
his paycheck every month.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.358
There's nothing left
to pay the bills.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.698
- Please.

23:33.620 --> 23:35.497
You've come to the right place.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.167
We don't turn anyone away.

23:39.960 --> 23:43.380
I'll just need you to sign some
papers before we get started.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.134
- You're so kind.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.351
- I don't get it.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.563
So how are they
making money off of suicides

23:59.646 --> 24:01.690
when people can't even
pay them back?

24:01.773 --> 24:05.819
- Most of this contract seems
to be a life insurance policy.

24:05.902 --> 24:08.405
- In a bank loan?
That's a thing?

24:08.488 --> 24:10.157
- To be honest,
I've never seen

24:10.240 --> 24:11.825
anything quite like this
before.

24:11.908 --> 24:14.995
- Do insurance policies
pay off on bank loans?

24:15.078 --> 24:19.666
- In Japan they do.
You're not in Kansas anymore.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.168
- I'm from Missouri.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.836
You know, Kansas
is a completely different,

24:22.919 --> 24:24.546
arguably inferior, state.

24:24.629 --> 24:25.463
- Here.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.341
"In the event of death,
decedent's estate

24:28.425 --> 24:31.887
"will relinquish
any and all claims

24:31.970 --> 24:34.055
"to all insurance payouts,

24:34.139 --> 24:37.559
which shall be paid forthwith
to said loan company."

24:37.642 --> 24:38.101
- So they're getting people
to take out

24:38.185 --> 24:40.228
life insurance policies

24:40.312 --> 24:42.230
and then name
the credit company

24:42.314 --> 24:43.440
as the beneficiary.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.193
- And then they're hounding
and harassing them,

24:46.276 --> 24:48.445
driving them
to kill themselves,

24:48.528 --> 24:50.739
and collecting
all those policies.

24:50.822 --> 24:54.075
- Jesus, they found a way
to monetize suicide.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.952
Even for yakuza,
that's pretty fucking evil.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.704
- I'd say so.

24:57.787 --> 25:00.081
- Sorry.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.541
You have no idea how many

25:01.625 --> 25:03.585
legal affairs bureaus
we had to go to.

25:03.668 --> 25:06.755
- Plus, all of your
time-consuming little detours.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.924
- Taking a moment
to read the plaque

25:09.007 --> 25:10.217
off a historic building
is not a "detour."

25:10.300 --> 25:12.344
- Did you find an address?

25:12.427 --> 25:14.763
It took some effort.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.431
He had to promise to have
coffee with the file clerk

25:16.514 --> 25:19.517
because she thought
he was so attractive.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.440
Voilà!

25:25.523 --> 25:27.609
The address
of the corporate headquarters

25:27.692 --> 25:30.779
and the name of the CEO.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.240
- Kiyoshi Sonoda.
Holy shit.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.076
- Right?
- Let's pay him a visit.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.744
Get the map.

25:37.827 --> 25:38.620
- Map, map, map!

25:57.847 --> 25:58.807
- Here?

25:58.890 --> 26:02.352
Does this look like
where a corporate CEO lives?

26:02.435 --> 26:03.478
- Let's check.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.315
- Are you sure
this is the right address?

26:07.399 --> 26:08.525
- I'm sure it is.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.710
Hai, hai. Sumimasen.

26:28.503 --> 26:32.007
Is this the home
of Kyoshi Sonoda?

26:32.382 --> 26:34.009
- Hai.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.887
- Would it be possible
to speak to him?

26:38.596 --> 26:39.806
- To my father?

26:39.889 --> 26:41.433
- Hai.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.310
- I'm sorry,

26:43.393 --> 26:46.896
but my father has been unable
to see guests for years.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.990
- Okay, I'd never
heard of the dish, either,

26:57.073 --> 26:58.533
but apparently
it's a delicacy in Ishikawa.

26:58.616 --> 27:01.494
And Fukasaka-san
is an entomologist.

27:01.578 --> 27:02.871
- Entomologist?

27:02.954 --> 27:05.707
- A scientist
who studies insects.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.541
So when he ordered them
I figured,

27:06.624 --> 27:10.378
you know, new adventure.
Why not try it?

27:10.462 --> 27:11.379
- You're far braver than I am.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.840
And so, you--what?
Just eat them whole?

27:13.923 --> 27:15.216
- They don't even take
the stingers off,

27:15.300 --> 27:16.718
and they're huge.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.011
Fukasaka-san
said he was stung once

27:18.094 --> 27:18.845
getting too close
to the hive.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.139
Felt like getting hit
by a nail gun.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.350
And then he pulled
the deep-fried hornet

27:23.433 --> 27:25.810
out of the tonkatsu sauce
and said...

27:25.894 --> 27:28.063
Don't worry, Samantha-san,

27:28.146 --> 27:32.233
I got my revenge.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.111
- Your range
of knowledge is astonishing.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.404
- Thank you.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.990
That's the best part
of the job.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.951
Clients have given me books,
taken me on lectures,

27:42.035 --> 27:43.620
trips across Japan.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.330
Experiences I really
never would have had.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.290
- Well, it seems
you finally found

27:47.374 --> 27:50.460
a life that works for you.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.586
- Finally?
- Mm-hmm.

27:51.669 --> 27:55.006
But I do have to wonder,
at what cost?

27:56.549 --> 27:58.051
- I don't--

27:58.134 --> 28:00.762
Forgive me, Matso-san.
I don't understand.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.556
- Well, when one rejects
one's life and flees

28:03.640 --> 28:06.559
in the dead of night,
I imagine one would always

28:06.643 --> 28:09.562
be looking over one's shoulder,
wouldn't one?

28:12.690 --> 28:13.650
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.194
- Did you really think
you could hide forever

28:16.277 --> 28:18.738
after what you did?

28:23.118 --> 28:26.246
Now you're thinking,
"Do I pack a bag and run?

28:26.329 --> 28:28.081
"How much cash do I need?

28:28.164 --> 28:30.667
"Just enough to fit
in the small red travel bag

28:30.750 --> 28:32.627
"in my hallway closet?

28:32.710 --> 28:34.796
Or will I need the suitcase
beneath my bed?"

28:36.881 --> 28:40.343
And if you do try and run,
I'll find you again.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.304
It's what I do.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.597
This isn't a game,
Samantha-san.

28:44.681 --> 28:48.393
You get one chance
to play this right.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.397
- I'm listening.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.481
- You were not easy to find.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.151
The people you stole from
believed

28:56.234 --> 28:58.653
you had left Japan entirely,
as you hoped they would.

28:58.736 --> 29:02.031
But my client has deep pockets
and a wide reach,

29:02.115 --> 29:06.411
and they're determined to see
you answer for your crimes.

29:06.494 --> 29:08.705
Lucky for you,
all I'm interested in

29:08.788 --> 29:12.417
is how much your freedom
is worth to you.

29:14.669 --> 29:17.797
- What do you want?
- We'll get to that.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.175
Let's finish our dinner.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.723
- I'm not sitting here
for this shit.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.934
This has been a lovely dinner,
but I need to get to work.

29:30.018 --> 29:34.063
- This isn't going away,
and neither am I.

29:34.147 --> 29:35.732
So I urge you, Samantha,

29:35.815 --> 29:38.526
to consider everything
you have to lose here.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.864
And as your people would say,
"Choose the right."

30:01.883 --> 30:04.552
- Kanpai.
Here's to dead-ends.

30:07.514 --> 30:13.228
- Hmm, but this Sonoda guy

30:13.311 --> 30:14.479
has got
to be connected somehow, right?

30:14.562 --> 30:16.898
- No, that's the point.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.816
He's just the name
on the corporate document.

30:21.152 --> 30:21.778
- So what do we do now?

30:23.112 --> 30:25.406
- Nothing.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.824
- Nothing?

30:26.908 --> 30:28.952
You're just gonna sit there

30:29.035 --> 30:31.871
and let the yakuza make bank
off people killing themselves?

30:31.955 --> 30:32.830
We still have time.
- Stop!

30:35.542 --> 30:37.710
I don't need convincing.

30:37.794 --> 30:40.088
You said, "There's something
here worth chasing."

30:40.171 --> 30:42.382
You're right. Trust me.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.384
When you want something
too much,

30:44.467 --> 30:48.263
you can get so distracted
that you miss things,

30:48.346 --> 30:51.015
and this story
is too important to get wrong.

30:52.392 --> 30:55.103
- Yeah, you're right.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.273
It's just... what they're doing
to these people

30:58.356 --> 31:01.109
is horrible.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.110
- Even so...

31:02.193 --> 31:06.739
this isn't the only story
on my plate or yours.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.410
Be patient.

31:12.787 --> 31:17.667
Get back
to the arson story, okay?

31:25.341 --> 31:27.093
- Meicho Shimbun, City Desk.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.640
Detective Toma, thank you
for returning my call.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.436
I was wondering
when you might be free.

31:37.395 --> 31:38.938
- As the girl said,

31:39.022 --> 31:44.027
I told you about those
who are overly nice.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.154
And the girl placed her hands
on the window.

31:46.696 --> 31:50.783
She asked, who is white,
fluffy, tasty,

31:50.867 --> 31:53.870
and smarter than a wolf?

31:54.495 --> 31:57.415
That is me, she said.

31:58.124 --> 32:01.419
And she closed the window.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.463
The end.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.131
That's it. Let's sleep.

32:05.214 --> 32:06.841
- Read some more!

32:06.924 --> 32:08.926
- It's time to sleep.
Shino, let's go to your bed.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.845
- Then do the song!

32:12.597 --> 32:13.973
- Frog song, please.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.810
- Ah. Right. Okay.

32:18.895 --> 32:18.936
One second.

32:24.609 --> 32:28.446
both:

32:47.465 --> 32:49.884
- I'm coming in!

32:58.851 --> 33:02.397
Didn't I tell you you'd regret
it if you fucked with me?

33:02.480 --> 33:04.065
- Oi.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.274
Get out.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.443
Now.

33:15.743 --> 33:18.454
- Is this the part
where you rough me up?

33:37.014 --> 33:39.016
- You know how many girls
come to Japan,

33:39.100 --> 33:41.102
try and make money
in the mizu-shobai?

33:41.185 --> 33:43.062
- Yeah, I do.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.147
I know exactly how many

33:44.230 --> 33:48.109
and where they're from,
what they're looking for.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.946
- My boss knows this, too,
and he says,

33:52.029 --> 33:54.490
"Girls who don't play
by the rules

33:54.574 --> 33:56.117
can meet unfortunate ends."

33:56.200 --> 33:59.787
- Don't fucking threaten me.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.419
- Hey.

34:06.502 --> 34:07.795
Hey!

34:09.714 --> 34:11.507
I'm not the enemy.

34:11.591 --> 34:14.677
Understand?
I'm trying to protect you.

34:14.761 --> 34:19.015
- Do I look like
a fucking damsel in distress?

34:19.098 --> 34:19.932
If I need protection,

34:20.016 --> 34:23.102
I can do a hell
of a lot better than you.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.094
- She's not here.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.640
- Samantha?

35:12.109 --> 35:14.612
- You get that information
for my boss yet?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.244
- I'm working on it.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.957
Here's
what I don't get, though.

35:26.624 --> 35:29.460
Even if I do manage to get
something from my source...

35:30.086 --> 35:34.465
how's your boss
supposed to know

35:34.549 --> 35:37.301
the information's any good?

35:37.385 --> 35:42.640
- Because if it isn't,
we'll come after you.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.519
- Well...

35:50.648 --> 35:52.316
That's good motivation.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.908
- Let's get the fuck
out of here.

36:00.992 --> 36:01.075
Thanks.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.018
- All right, I'll have
some too. Just a little.

36:27.101 --> 36:28.185
I'll be sipping mine.

36:31.105 --> 36:34.150
- Once again, to Emi-chan.
Kanpai!

36:34.233 --> 36:34.859
- To Emi-chan. Kanpai!

36:34.942 --> 36:36.777
- How many times
are we toasting?

36:36.861 --> 36:38.613
- This is the fourth.

36:38.696 --> 36:41.949
- You're looking good.
You got a boyfriend?

36:43.701 --> 36:45.620
I bet you got a lot
of boyfriends.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.957
- I was hoping you could take
a look at something for me.

36:54.378 --> 36:55.463
This...

36:56.047 --> 36:59.175
- Oh, yeah, I remember her.
- She was cute.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.259
- If you like that type.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.347
- It happened just recently,
right?

37:04.430 --> 37:05.598
- Yeah.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.183
But when I read
the confession--

37:07.266 --> 37:08.726
- Wait, I'm confused.

37:08.809 --> 37:09.310
How did you get ahold
of the confession?

37:10.895 --> 37:12.313
- Hmm. How did I?

37:13.856 --> 37:15.107
- Thatta girl.

37:15.524 --> 37:17.151
- Got her trained, huh?

37:19.403 --> 37:25.576
- How's your daughter,
Detective Toma? 16 now?

37:25.660 --> 37:28.329
She must be so proud of you.

37:29.538 --> 37:34.210
In the confession, the suspect
claims he smashed her head in.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.379
- So?

37:36.462 --> 37:39.882
- Does she look like her head
was smashed in?

37:41.175 --> 37:43.010
She was strangled.

37:44.345 --> 37:48.265
Whoever actually killed her
would know that.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.769
- Look, this guy confessed.
Of his own accord.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.271
Case closed.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.356
- Yeah, but--

37:55.439 --> 37:56.857
- It's always work with you.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.902
Come on, loosen up.

37:59.986 --> 38:00.236
Let's get another round!

38:01.946 --> 38:03.280
Excuse me!

38:30.307 --> 38:32.893
- This place is fucking sick.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.354
- Hey, be cool, gaijin boy.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.439
- I'm always cool, baby.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.866
You're cool, though.
What's it like to be a yakuza?

38:46.949 --> 38:51.370
- You are writing an article?
"My Night Out With Gangster."

38:51.454 --> 38:53.122
- Can I?

38:56.333 --> 38:58.127
- No work tonight, Meicho.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.004
Play time.
- Play time, man.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.306
Come on.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.726
Come on.
Let's blow off some steam, man.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.102
I'll meet you down there.

40:31.428 --> 40:33.013
- I like how you dance.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.598
- Is that so?

41:02.793 --> 41:05.171
- No, Akira, I hate it there.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.256
- Come on, baby.
It can't be that bad.

41:07.339 --> 41:09.842
- You think that because
here you get me,

41:09.925 --> 41:12.052
fucking goddess in heels.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.888
At my club, I get these old men

41:13.971 --> 41:16.056
who stink like squid
and look like broom.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.057
They talk, talk, talk,
and I have to pretend

41:17.141 --> 41:18.392
what they say is interesting.

41:18.475 --> 41:23.063
- You make them happy.
You make me happy.

41:25.774 --> 41:29.236
Should we get another?
- Sure.

41:31.614 --> 41:34.575
I've been thinking lately
about going somewhere else.

41:35.492 --> 41:37.077
- You want to work
at a different club?

41:37.161 --> 41:39.538
- No, Akira. Another agency.

41:39.622 --> 41:43.667
Maybe I could try to start work
as a model again.

41:43.751 --> 41:46.420
- Baby, we talked about this.

41:46.503 --> 41:48.631
You're so pretty,

41:48.714 --> 41:50.466
but modeling
is not working for you.

41:50.549 --> 41:51.926
You make more cash at Onyx.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.177
- It didn't work out here,

41:53.260 --> 41:56.347
but maybe I could find
more work somewhere else.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.933
Maybe London or New York.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.895
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
You leave Japan?

42:02.978 --> 42:05.147
That's how little
I mean to you?

42:05.231 --> 42:09.068
- No.
You mean-you mean everything.

42:09.151 --> 42:11.028
- Then how could you leave me?

42:11.111 --> 42:13.239
I thought you were different
than all the others.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.116
Maybe you're just another liar.
- I'm not lying!

42:16.200 --> 42:17.493
- Hey, baby!
- Don't talk to me.

42:17.576 --> 42:19.245
- Akira, please.
- Hey, Polina.

42:19.328 --> 42:20.996
Where is Malee?
- Holy shit!

42:21.080 --> 42:22.373
- Where is she?
- You finally came to Miralina?

42:22.456 --> 42:23.791
- Where's Malee?

42:23.874 --> 42:24.833
- Someone has ordered

42:24.917 --> 42:27.378
a bottle of Camus Tradition
for 1.2 million yen!

42:27.461 --> 42:29.129
- Is she here?
- Join us, five minutes.

42:29.213 --> 42:32.132
You'll meet your soul mate.
We promise. We promise.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.968
- Mind your own
fucking business.

42:34.051 --> 42:34.677
- Don't be mean.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.184
- Malee. Malee! Hi.
- Oh, hi, you're here.

42:42.268 --> 42:45.312
- What the fuck?
- What?

42:45.396 --> 42:46.272
- What did you say to him?
- Who?

42:46.355 --> 42:48.774
- What'd you say to him?
Nothing?

42:48.857 --> 42:50.359
Then how the fuck does
Duke know

42:50.442 --> 42:51.777
that I'm starting my own club?

42:51.860 --> 42:54.822
- I didn't--
- Fuckin' bullshit.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.323
A year.
It's been a whole year.

42:56.407 --> 42:59.118
No one knows anything.
Zip. Quiet.

42:59.201 --> 43:00.911
I say one thing to you--
- I was trying to protect you!

43:00.995 --> 43:02.329
- Protect me?

43:02.413 --> 43:04.748
- The other girls
are so jealous of you.

43:04.832 --> 43:05.791
I want to shut them up,

43:05.874 --> 43:08.711
so I just told them
soon you have your own club.

43:08.794 --> 43:11.338
- You vapid, fucking idiot!

43:11.422 --> 43:13.424
Now I have the yakuza
breathing down my neck

43:13.507 --> 43:14.800
because of fucking you!

43:14.883 --> 43:16.302
- Samantha!

43:20.723 --> 43:21.015
Have you lost your mind?

43:21.098 --> 43:22.391
- She fucked me.

43:22.474 --> 43:26.020
- Hey, bullshit.
This isn't about Malee.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.646
I know you.

43:31.233 --> 43:33.319
What is going on?

43:35.654 --> 43:36.905
Talk to me.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.367
- You can't help me.

43:45.664 --> 43:46.540
- Whichever.

43:48.625 --> 43:50.878
- There are so many options.

43:50.961 --> 43:51.962
This one?

43:55.257 --> 43:56.842
- I can't pick.
- Oh, come on.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.345
Let's pick this one.

43:59.428 --> 44:00.637
Okay.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.723
What were you watching?

44:47.976 --> 44:48.852
- Yuka-chan.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.605
- Watch me, and only me.

45:52.624 --> 45:55.752
- Ahh!

45:58.422 --> 45:59.590
Oh.

46:35.292 --> 46:37.085
- Thank you.

46:38.712 --> 46:40.422
- Could we see
each other again sometime?

46:40.506 --> 46:40.881
- I would like that.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.140
- Thanks.

46:50.224 --> 46:51.266
- Thanks.

46:56.063 --> 46:57.105
- Thanks.

47:02.653 --> 47:03.654
Here.

47:04.738 --> 47:06.365
Call me anytime.

47:07.699 --> 47:07.783
Bye-bye.

47:30.097 --> 47:31.807
- Burning the midnight oil?

47:32.849 --> 47:34.977
Or avoiding going home?

47:38.689 --> 47:42.484
- Chasing a story.
It's still out of reach.

47:43.193 --> 47:47.656
- Keep after it. I'm confident
it won't elude you for long.

47:48.907 --> 47:49.908
- Thank you.

47:52.452 --> 47:57.833
I wish my colleagues
shared your confidence.

47:58.750 --> 48:02.421
- When in doubt,
follow your instinct.

48:02.504 --> 48:07.009
No matter what anyone
here says. It's worked for me.

48:08.719 --> 48:09.011
Always.

48:10.387 --> 48:11.513
- Always?

48:13.390 --> 48:15.225
- I hired you, didn't I?

48:16.977 --> 48:17.477
Good night.

48:17.561 --> 48:18.937
- Good night to you too.

48:22.899 --> 48:26.945
- Welcome, Mr. Sato.
Please follow me.

48:30.532 --> 48:31.825
- Hey, I think
this place might be

48:31.908 --> 48:34.202
a little out
of my price range, you know?

48:34.286 --> 48:36.455
- My treat.

48:42.836 --> 48:45.714
Here's your Peking duck.

48:50.719 --> 48:52.846
- What's it like in America?

48:52.929 --> 48:54.222
- That's a big question.

48:55.515 --> 48:57.100
America is big.

48:58.310 --> 49:00.103
But I'm from Missouri.

49:00.187 --> 49:01.730
- Missouri?
- Yeah, Missouri.

49:01.813 --> 49:03.649
- Missouri.
- Called the "Show Me State."

49:03.732 --> 49:05.942
- Why?
- I have no idea.

49:06.026 --> 49:11.740
But I was born and raised
in Columbia, Missouri.

49:11.823 --> 49:13.158
It's kind of
like the heartland.

49:14.951 --> 49:16.203
Apple pie.

49:16.286 --> 49:16.912
- Apple pie?
- Football.

49:16.995 --> 49:20.374
- Football.
You are tough guy?

49:20.457 --> 49:22.084
- No.
- Hmm.

49:24.419 --> 49:25.712
- I did musicals.

49:25.796 --> 49:29.091
- Seriously?
- Yeah. I was good.

49:31.051 --> 49:32.886
- You miss it? Missouri?

49:32.969 --> 49:35.180
- Hmm, mm-mm.

49:35.263 --> 49:37.516
- How about your family?

49:39.476 --> 49:42.062
- They miss me.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.814
You know, my mom
is always calling

49:43.897 --> 49:47.943
and trying to guilt me
into coming home.

49:48.026 --> 49:50.237
- That is so Japanese.

49:51.738 --> 49:53.532
- I know.
- Very Japanese.

49:54.366 --> 49:55.075
Brothers and sisters?

49:57.661 --> 50:00.247
- I got a sister.
- You miss her?

50:00.330 --> 50:01.915
- You got a lot
of questions, huh?

50:03.667 --> 50:07.087
How about you? You got family?

50:11.007 --> 50:11.049
- No.

50:26.523 --> 50:27.983
- Fuck.

50:29.359 --> 50:30.610
Fuck!

50:33.363 --> 50:35.824
- I tell you.

50:35.907 --> 50:38.785
I haven't eaten this good
since I don't know.

50:42.372 --> 50:43.915
What?

50:52.382 --> 50:54.926
- Thank you for dinner.

50:59.014 --> 51:01.141
- Don't look.

51:14.488 --> 51:15.363
- Nice watch.

51:16.615 --> 51:18.992
Vacheron Constantin, right?

51:20.577 --> 51:22.829
- You have a good eye...
for a gaijin.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.791
- You have good taste...
for a gangster.

51:25.874 --> 51:26.500
- Who do you think
you're talking to?

51:26.583 --> 51:28.001
- Please relax.

51:42.182 --> 51:44.559
If you ever wanna talk shop...

51:44.935 --> 51:46.353
Whenever.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.774
- Reporters here
are not always well liked.

51:51.858 --> 51:54.152
Soon you will find out.

51:54.236 --> 51:56.613
Especially if they're good
at their job.

51:56.696 --> 52:01.368
- So good reporters here
have a lot of enemies?

52:01.451 --> 52:03.995
- A man without enemies
is no man at all.

52:04.788 --> 52:07.040
Give my respects
to your oyabun.

52:37.654 --> 52:39.114
- This isn't
a game, Samantha-san.

52:39.197 --> 52:42.784
You get one chance
to play this right,

52:42.868 --> 52:47.455
and as your people would say,
"Choose the right."
