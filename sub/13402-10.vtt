(narrator)
Pre v/ous/y on
’Pretty Little L/ars. . ”

00:03.470 --> 00:05.495
Hanna is not picking up,
and she's not with Mona.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.161
(Spencer)
0r Caleb,
but she did drop by his place

00:07.170 --> 00:08.535
last night to tell him
that she would he going

00:08.540 --> 00:09.939
ot'ir the grid
for a couple of days.

00:09.940 --> 00:11.430
She's gonna do
something to Noel.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.101
(Ezra)
Maybe we could
just skip the headache

00:13.110 --> 00:16.238
and inevitable parental drama
and just elope.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.606
We could be wine tasting
under the Tuscan sun by Friday.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.973
Jordan and I broke up.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.073
- Are we still friends?
- Always.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.842
- It's happening again.
- Noel Kahn.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.147
He's the one doing this to us.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.116
- 'Can you come over?‘
- 'I'll be right there.‘

00:28.120 --> 00:30.680
I'm Agent Lee from the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

00:30.690 --> 00:31.884
You were involved
with Nicole Gordon?

00:31.890 --> 00:33.221
Yes, I was.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.050
We have reason to believe
that she may be alive.

00:35.060 --> 00:37.199
- Did Ezra get to Colombia okay?
- Yeah.

00:37.200 --> 00:39.225
(Spencer)
'Any news about Nicole?‘

00:39.240 --> 00:40.559
[sighs]

00:40.570 --> 00:42.060
Spencer. What happened?

00:42.070 --> 00:43.560
- Are you okay?
- Someone's in the house.

00:43.570 --> 00:45.265
- That's Noel's parents' cabin.
- 'Oh, my God.‘

00:45.270 --> 00:47.261
That's the same area
where Hanna was held captive.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.134
(Em/M
But I thought his parents
sold this place years ago.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.038
(Spencer)
God only knows what’s inside.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.847
(Em/M
Hopefully, the evidence we need
to ﬁnally end this thing.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.545
(Spencer)
'Noel Kahn was there
the whole time?‘

00:54.550 --> 00:56.347
We may not be able to prove
that he tortured Hanna

00:56.350 --> 00:58.011
'but this proves
that he tortured us.‘

00:58.020 --> 00:59.385
(Hanna)
I knew you’d eventual/y
slip up.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.449
The cell phone
was a big screw-up.

01:01.460 --> 01:04.179
Be careful, Hanna,
or you'll end up just like Sara.

01:07.130 --> 01:09.052
If we do this, there's
no stepping back from it.

01:09.070 --> 01:11.322
And we risk the police
finding out about Archer.

01:11.330 --> 01:12.763
You mean, finding out
that Hanna ran him over

01:12.770 --> 01:14.533
and you buried him like a dog?

01:14.540 --> 01:17.168
To quote my dead husband,
"Karma's a bitch."

01:17.170 --> 01:19.206
It was an accident.
And we knew how it looked.

01:19.210 --> 01:20.632
We did it to protect Hanna.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.234
Who's currently
our resident girl gone rogue.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.444
I'm trying her one last time.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.179
Let's just ping her cell
and go get her.

01:26.180 --> 01:28.614
I gave her a new phone, okay.
You can't hack it.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.484
[cell phone dialing]

01:32.490 --> 01:34.014
[sighs]
Why isn't she picking up?

01:34.020 --> 01:35.157
Because Noel probably
has her locked up

01:35.160 --> 01:36.582
in another slaughtering hole.

01:36.590 --> 01:37.818
(Hanna on answering machine)
'Hey, it's Hanna.‘

01:37.830 --> 01:39.320
'Leave a message.‘

01:39.330 --> 01:40.388
Let's just call the cops, okay.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.628
Tell them everything you just

01:41.630 --> 01:42.654
told us about Jenna and Noel.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.898
And Sara Harvey.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.424
None of us believes
that was an accident.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.523
I'm heading to The Radley. Maybe
Jenna will lead us to Noel.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.069
[door opens]

01:50.070 --> 01:51.606
Do we call Furey or 911?

01:51.610 --> 01:54.579
Noel is out there somewhere,
and he might have Hanna.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.249
[keypad beeping]

01:59.250 --> 02:00.774
[cell phone dialing]

(woman on phone)
'911. What is your emergency?‘

02:03.120 --> 02:05.088
I think
my friend's been abducted.

02:05.960 --> 02:06.984
Wake up, bitch.

02:06.990 --> 02:08.218
[groans]

02:28.840 --> 02:30.478
(Hanna)
Noel, please!

02:30.480 --> 02:33.142
Please open the door!
You can't leave me in here!

02:33.150 --> 02:35.675
I'm begging you! Please!

02:36.690 --> 02:38.339
[sobbing]

02:50.200 --> 02:52.395
This is your chance
to tell me the truth.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.788
Just admit it.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.936
Admit you're A.D.

02:57.940 --> 02:59.362
[groans]

03:03.310 --> 03:04.538
Fine.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.241
We'll do it my way.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.411
[groaning]

03:27.500 --> 03:30.492
[dramatic music]

03:34.110 --> 03:35.771
Got a secret

03:35.780 --> 03:37.077
Can you keep it?

03:37.080 --> 03:39.446
Swear this one you'll save

03:39.450 --> 03:41.918
Better lock it
in your pocket

03:41.920 --> 03:44.718
Taking this one to the grave

03:44.720 --> 03:45.846
If I show you

03:45.850 --> 03:47.989
Then I know you won't tell

03:47.990 --> 03:49.514
What I said

03:49.530 --> 03:51.987
'Cause two can keep a secret

03:51.990 --> 03:54.595
If one of them is dead

03:56.730 --> 03:59.528
[indistinct radio chatter]

03:59.540 --> 04:02.429
I want an update as soon
as they get to Kahn's lakehouse.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.307
And I want Mary Drake found
and brought in for questioning.

04:07.110 --> 04:08.304
His stepsister hasn't left

04:08.310 --> 04:09.675
The Radley
since yesterday morning.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.841
We verified her story
with hotel security.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.477
Hmm. Keep a tail on her.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.971
Not sure how much of a threat
a blind girl can be.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.412
You haven't met Jenna.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.445
Look, I was hoping to buy you
a beer after your shift

04:19.460 --> 04:21.815
but doesn't look like
that's gonna happen.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.378
Well, today doesn't have to be
my last day.

04:23.390 --> 04:24.652
- H can..
- Toby.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.651
I know that you and Spencer
are old friends

04:26.660 --> 04:27.820
but I promise you

04:27.830 --> 04:30.321
nothing's gonna happen
to those women on my watch.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.765
If I don't see you later..

04:37.770 --> 04:39.658
...thank you for your service.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.141
You guys, it was Mona.
The cops questioned Jenna.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.175
Well, did they arrest her?

04:51.190 --> 04:52.919
No, she's still at The Radley.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.444
You say that
like it's a good thing.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.257
Well, yeah, I mean,
she can't lead us to Noel

04:56.260 --> 04:57.955
if she's locked up.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.325
I'm gonna go meet up with Mona.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.388
Call us if you hear anything.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.449
[radio chatter continues]

05:05.130 --> 05:07.621
Hey, um..

05:07.640 --> 05:10.234
I'm sorry that I lied to you
last night.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.038
I should have told you
about Noel. I was just scared.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.133
You don't have to apologize,
Spencer.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.870
I did my homework on you
right after we met.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.303
I read about Charlotte
and the bunker.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.912
And now to find out
that Noel was helping her

05:21.920 --> 05:23.512
keep you down there?

05:23.520 --> 05:26.409
I got an APB out on Kahn,
and I'm bringing him in

05:26.420 --> 05:29.150
and we're gonna find Hanna...
today.

05:30.530 --> 05:31.758
Thank you.

05:34.660 --> 05:37.128
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Did I just do that?

05:37.130 --> 05:39.394
- Yeah, well, it's okay.
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.164
Just don't let it happen again.

05:42.170 --> 05:44.638
At least not here.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.234
(woman on TV)
'The police are looking
for Hanna Marin.‘

05:47.240 --> 05:49.379
'Any information
regarding her whereabouts'

05:49.380 --> 05:52.770
'should be directed to
the Rosewood Police Department.‘

05:52.780 --> 05:56.739
'Hanna Marin, blonde, blue-eyed,
and 23 years old has not..'

05:56.750 --> 05:59.344
I'm gonna go call Hanna's mom.
She's at a conference in London.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.816
I just, I don't know
where she's staying.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.754
'Friends and family
first contacted the police'

06:02.760 --> 06:05.251
'after Marin stopped answering
her cell phone'

06:05.260 --> 06:07.581
'and failed
to return to her home.‘

06:08.760 --> 06:11.422
So what's the rush,
if you don't mind me asking?

06:11.430 --> 06:13.091
Trying to prove
somebody's your baby daddy?

06:13.100 --> 06:14.692
[sighs]
Something like that.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.236
I can get you the results
by tomorrow.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.382
I am telling you, Noel,
the cops are all over me.

06:37.390 --> 06:39.984
'They think you have Hanna.
Do you?‘

06:40.900 --> 06:43.027
Just call me, okay?

06:43.030 --> 06:44.224
Hey.

06:44.230 --> 06:45.390
Jenna's left three messages

06:45.400 --> 06:46.924
for Noel since I've been here.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.896
'She doesn't know where he is.'

06:49.940 --> 06:51.737
So did Noel double-cross her..

06:51.740 --> 06:54.231
...or did Hanna
get to him first?

06:54.240 --> 06:55.832
(female #1)
'Oh, yeah. That's right..'

06:57.110 --> 06:58.907
(Ezra)
'They sent out
a final search crew'

06:58.910 --> 07:01.413
but I think that's mainly
to appease the people

07:01.420 --> 07:03.809
that came down here hoping,
like me.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.481
Ezra, I'm sorry.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.486
I get why you deleted the call.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.651
No one should have
to mourn someone twme.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.689
So I'll pick you up
from the airport.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.952
'We can go to that diner
that you like'

07:17.970 --> 07:20.097
the place
with the sugar-cream pie.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.295
That's okay. I can take a cab.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.535
But if you don't have any plans,
I would really like it

07:26.540 --> 07:28.576
if you're home when I got there.

07:29.380 --> 07:31.701
I'll see you tonight then.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.679
- I love you.
- I love you too.

and I need you to come alone.

08:04.380 --> 08:05.938
I'm sorry
to rope you in like this

08:05.950 --> 08:08.043
but when I saw the news,
I didn't know who else to call.

08:08.050 --> 08:10.041
Well, next time, call me
before you abduct someone

08:10.050 --> 08:13.144
and go on the run. It just
makes my life a little easier.

08:14.460 --> 08:15.552
[groaning]

08:15.560 --> 08:17.357
When do you get
the test results?

08:17.360 --> 08:18.884
Not till tomorrow.

08:18.890 --> 08:22.098
[indistinct radio chatter]

08:24.230 --> 08:25.663
What are you doing?

08:28.640 --> 08:31.507
[sighs]
Looking for this.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.359
What is that?

08:34.380 --> 08:36.075
You seriously
haven't spoken to anyone?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.401
Well, I've kinda
had my hands full.

08:38.410 --> 08:39.946
There is footage on here
that proves

08:39.950 --> 08:41.611
that Noel was working
with Charlotte.

08:41.620 --> 08:43.474
- He was part of the dollhouse.
- What?

08:43.490 --> 08:45.742
I was worried he destroyed it,
but clearly you knocked him out

08:45.750 --> 08:47.047
before he had the chance to.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.756
Look, Hanna, you don't need
the test results.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.854
This is more than enough
to put Noel behind bars.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.197
No.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.899
What do you mean no?

08:57.900 --> 08:59.265
Busting Noel for the dollhouse

08:59.270 --> 09:01.591
is like busting a mob boss
for tax evasion.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.033
It's settling..

09:04.910 --> 09:06.434
...and I'm not ready to settle.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.034
But, Hanna, you can't get
any worse than the dollhouse.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.679
I have scars on my back
that say different.

09:13.550 --> 09:14.847
I want Noel
to be held accountable

09:14.850 --> 09:16.818
for everything he did.

09:16.820 --> 09:18.788
I'm gonna prove he's A.D.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.151
I need to.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.152
Please.

09:28.160 --> 09:31.049
Help me. I just need to stay
hidden for ten more hours.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.322
That's the last thing
you're gonna do.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.337
- Thanks, Paige.
- Stay as long as you'd like.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.463
[sighs]

09:40.480 --> 09:41.504
- Here.
- Thanks.

09:41.510 --> 09:42.670
I also have some breakfast stuff

09:42.680 --> 09:44.773
'in here if you're hungry.‘

09:44.780 --> 09:46.668
I couldn't be more nauseated.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.047
How much longer are we gonna be
penned up in here like veal?

09:50.050 --> 09:52.587
Furey says we can't leave
until they find Noel.

09:52.590 --> 09:54.239
Well, it's hard enough
going through this

09:54.260 --> 09:56.012
without being gawked at.

09:59.490 --> 10:01.799
You mean, Paige?
I invited her.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.927
Why? She has nothing
to do with this.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.192
She's here to support us.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.065
Don't forget,
she was targeted by "A" when--

10:07.070 --> 10:08.765
Fine, Ijust think
it's a little pathetic

10:08.770 --> 10:10.988
that she's using us
to get close to you.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.137
Doesn't she know
that you're dating someone?

10:14.310 --> 10:15.971
Yeah, well

10:15.980 --> 10:18.369
things with Sabrina
are kind of on pause.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.598
I can't talk to her about this.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.748
Em, it's all over the news.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.945
And I know
I'll have to deal with it, okay.

10:25.950 --> 10:28.783
But it's easier with Paige.
She's been through this before.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.655
She understands it and me.

10:30.660 --> 10:32.878
Guys, looks like
something's happening.

10:32.890 --> 10:34.619
[indistinct chatter]

10:34.630 --> 10:36.393
Maybe they found Hanna.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.997
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.733
Thank you for the update, Greg.

10:43.740 --> 10:46.163
Let's go ahead and alert
the state troopers too.

10:46.710 --> 10:47.961
What's going on?

10:47.980 --> 10:50.540
The officers who went
to the Kahn lakehouse

10:50.550 --> 10:52.700
found two sets of footprints.

10:52.710 --> 10:54.405
There was a struggle.

10:55.620 --> 10:58.316
(Hanna)
It looks bad, I know

10:58.320 --> 11:01.380
but I wanted to prove
to my friends and to all of you

11:01.390 --> 11:04.018
that Noel is the person
who's been tormenting us..

11:05.230 --> 11:07.357
...so I went to Holly Brook
to find the girl

11:07.360 --> 11:08.850
he pushed down the stairs.

11:08.860 --> 11:10.748
If I could get her to talk

11:10.770 --> 11:12.795
we'd have a credible witness.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.997
Unfortunately,
I couldn't track her down.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.865
I'm just so sorry
that I worried everybody

11:17.870 --> 11:20.430
by disappearing like that.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.873
I wasn't thinking.

11:22.780 --> 11:25.704
[clapping]

11:25.710 --> 11:27.473
You've gotten really good
at this.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.038
Do you think
the cops will buy it?

11:29.050 --> 11:31.780
Definitely. It's your friends
you need to worry about.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.746
They're way harder to fool.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.112
God, I hate lying to them.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.657
You're doing them a favor
by not getting them involved.

11:38.660 --> 11:41.185
Thank you again, Mona.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.088
Are you sure
you're able to handle--

11:43.100 --> 11:45.625
Don't worry.
I got my end covered.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.019
So why don't you run it
through for me one more time?

11:52.140 --> 11:53.266
It looks bad..

11:53.280 --> 11:56.602
...I know, I'm just so sorry
I worried everybody

11:56.610 --> 11:58.942
by disappearing like that.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.406
I wasn't thinking.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.619
Well, since we opened up
an investigation

12:05.620 --> 12:08.248
I'm gonna have to have you
sign a written statement.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.409
Sure.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.354

called us.‘

I'm not fickle. When I find what
works for me, I stick with it.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.731
Well, the trick is knowing

13:01.740 --> 13:03.503
when something isn't working
for you anymore.

13:03.510 --> 13:06.047
Enough with the makeup tips.

13:06.050 --> 13:08.405
What do you want?

leave those girls alone'

out of town.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.524

And why would I do that?

13:19.530 --> 13:20.781
Because, Bonnie

13:20.800 --> 13:22.791
Clyde's gonna be
in police custody real soon

13:22.800 --> 13:25.564
and my hunch is,
he's gonna sing like a canary.

13:25.570 --> 13:27.788
It sounds like I'd be better off
sticking around.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.667
Not if you want us to say
you had nothing to do with it.

13:34.410 --> 13:37.709
Mom, I'm telling you,
it was all a misunderstanding.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.746
- Thanks, officer.
- No, don't go on the plane.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.071
Go to your conference.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.968
Alright. I love you.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.312
Did she calm down?

13:47.320 --> 13:49.754
Yeah, she's gonna stay there.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.657
Thanks for bringing me home.

13:52.660 --> 13:54.150
Are you okay?

13:54.160 --> 13:55.525
Yeah.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.623
- You sure?
- Yeah.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.599
- I told you guys what happened.
- I know. I know.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.398
So then why do you
keep asking me if I'm okay?

14:03.410 --> 14:06.038
I guess I'm waiting
for an answer that I believe.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.271
I'm okay.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.975

Sorry, I don't buy that.

14:11.980 --> 14:14.278
Seriously.
Caleb, you can go, alright.

There's a cop right outside
my door, and he's not moving.

I left you in a room alone

14:24.560 --> 14:26.289
A.D. took you.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.382
So I hate
to break it to you, girl

14:27.400 --> 14:28.549
but you're stuck with me.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.619
Well, I really
want to be left alone.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.462
Why? Do you have somewhere
you need to be?

14:34.470 --> 14:36.290
You know,
you are a real pain in the ass.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.938
- So are you.
- Excuse me?

14:37.940 --> 14:39.999
Hanna, you don't do dishes
until they mold.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.103
You eat French fries
in bed, cold.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.670
You don't gas up the car
until it starts beeping.

14:44.680 --> 14:45.772
You won't admit
that we're meant to spend

14:45.780 --> 14:47.202
the rest of our lives together.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.712
You send food back if
the waiter breathes on it funny.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.415
And you know what, there's
probably milk in that fridge

14:52.420 --> 14:54.581
that's older than me.

14:54.590 --> 14:56.251
What did you say?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.853
[scoffs]
About the milk?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.728
No.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.038
I never want to spend
another day without you..

of my life.

you're a real pain in the ass.

Thanks again
for letting me crash here.

15:36.830 --> 15:39.492
Seeing Hanna and Caleb together,
I thought it'd be a good idea

15:39.500 --> 15:42.333
to just give them
some alone time.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.194
I-I can't shake the feeling

15:44.210 --> 15:46.235
'that Hanna's not telling us
the truth.'

15:46.240 --> 15:48.879
I mean, do you really think
that she would go off the grid

15:48.880 --> 15:50.131
just so we wouldn't know?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.799

I'm pregnant.

16:00.420 --> 16:01.648
In there.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.359
Are you sure?

16:07.360 --> 16:09.351
There's two lines on the stick.

16:11.230 --> 16:13.960
I was waiting for one
to disappear, but it didn't.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.404
At first, I thought
I was just stressed..

16:23.010 --> 16:25.649
...I mean, like before,
but it was a false alarm.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.176
Is it...Archer's?

16:31.190 --> 16:34.045
Of course.
Who else would it be?

16:37.960 --> 16:39.780

this is happening.

starting a family.

any decrsrons right now.

I know.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.137
Ijust..

16:57.150 --> 16:59.300
I thought my mom would be here
when this happened..

17:00.380 --> 17:02.610
...to give me advice.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.872
Not that she was
very good at It.

17:04.890 --> 17:07.415
At least I wouldn't be alone.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.957
No. You're not alone.

17:09.960 --> 17:13.350
I'm here, okay,
whatever you decide to do.

Hey, you're still in the air
right now

17:33.880 --> 17:35.768
but I just
wanted to let you know

17:35.780 --> 17:38.146
that when you get home,
there's..

17:38.150 --> 17:40.243
...there's gonna be a cop
outside your door

17:40.260 --> 17:43.309
and I, I didn't want you
to freak out.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.720
I'll explain everything
when you get here.

- Hi.
- Hey.

I just checked in with Dispatch.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.304
Wherever Noel is,
he's not gonna be stupid enough

18:02.310 --> 18:03.675
to try anything tonight.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.806
I personally placed an officer

18:04.810 --> 18:06.209
on every one of your doorsteps.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.338
- Thank you.
- I'm taking the night shift.

- Yeah.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.487
Here?

eat in the squad car.

I can't turn down Sarno's.
What did you get?

18:27.370 --> 18:30.362
Two orders
of spaghetti Bolognese.

18:30.370 --> 18:31.394
That's actually my favorite.

18:31.410 --> 18:32.399

a cherry soda

with crushed not cubed ice.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.177
How did you know that?

18:40.180 --> 18:42.375

might have helped me out.

Hey.

21:52.870 --> 21:56.169
So you thought that you could
leave without saying goodbye?

21:56.180 --> 21:58.637
You know I hate goodbyes.

21:58.650 --> 21:59.878
I do.

22:02.120 --> 22:03.610
Is Yvonne in the house?

22:03.620 --> 22:04.917
No, she, um

22:04.920 --> 22:06.410
_ she went to
go pick up some more boxes

22:06.420 --> 22:09.958

to be on lockdown.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.451
- I'm with a cop.
- Former cop.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.928
Well, Furey said
he would make an exception.

22:14.930 --> 22:17.023
I bet it's just for you, though.

22:19.830 --> 22:21.969
So this is it?

22:21.970 --> 22:23.130
For now, yeah

I wanted you to have it.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.399
You deserve love.

You deserve that kind of great,
big, beautiful love..

23:02.580 --> 23:03.979

Why are you here so early?
Is everything okay?

something

Ali is the same person
that she always used to be.

Paige, don't walk away.

It's like you're her puppet.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.334

26:58.350 --> 26:59.749
Well, I was sure
Noel was our guy

26:59.750 --> 27:01.001
and you guys
were just getting cold feet.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.339
Hanna, if by cold feet you mean

out of them'

I'm sorry.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.312
Ithought
if I did this on my own

27:09.320 --> 27:10.878
I could prove to you guys
that Noel was A.D.

talking in the past tense.

- What problem?

27:15.700 --> 27:17.224
I was wrong.

27:17.230 --> 27:18.322
I got the test results back

27:18.330 --> 27:20.195
and Noel isn't
Mary's second child.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.225
- He isn't?
- No.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.198
So you're saying he's not A.D.?

27:25.210 --> 27:26.859
Well, I'm not really
saying that either.

27:26.870 --> 27:27.962
What are you saying, Hanna?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.265
I'm saying I have Noel tied up

27:29.280 --> 27:30.531
to a chair in an old motel room

27:30.540 --> 27:32.474

down a flight of stairs

in the dollhouse.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.315
Emily's right,
just because he's not Mary's kid

27:42.320 --> 27:43.810
doesn't mean he's not A.D.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.412
How do we know for sure?

27:46.930 --> 27:48.522
Well, why don't we ask Noel?

27:50.130 --> 27:51.449
Together?

27:54.600 --> 27:56.033
It's worth a try.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.361

to get past the cops?

27:58.370 --> 27:59.962

take them with us'

every 15 minutes

it gets dark and then sneak out.

into Tim Burton's garage sale.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.543
Well, I'm not buying anything.

[sighs]
Let's get out of here.

33:56.730 --> 33:59.221
Oh, no.
I left my phone upstairs.

33:59.230 --> 34:00.595
Seriously?

34:00.600 --> 34:02.659
I don't wanna go back
up there by myself.

34:04.170 --> 34:06.764
- Come on.
- Just hurry up, okay?

34:06.770 --> 34:08.965
This place is a creep-fest.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.985
You really think
we'd let you leave?

34:40.040 --> 34:41.860
You can run..

34:43.210 --> 34:44.632
...but you can't hide.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.577
What is taking them so long?

34:50.580 --> 34:52.468
Oh, God,
I really wanna get out here.

up there. Come on.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.702
[grunts]

35:51.750 --> 35:53.706
I taught Jenna a lot..

35:54.950 --> 35:57.919
...but one thing
she taught Charlotte and me..

35:59.790 --> 36:01.849
...that was how to smell fear.

You've been the bitch

36:26.450 --> 36:29.749
the missing girl, the dead girl.

36:29.750 --> 36:33.288

Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, it's a head.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.823
- Oh, my God.
- It's a real head.

37:50.960 --> 37:53.929
