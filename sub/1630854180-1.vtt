That man is your father.

He's my father?

02:01.291 --> 02:05.208
[shushes] Look. Your father.

02:12.791 --> 02:14.416
His name is a beautiful name.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.000
And an important name.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.750
But it's a name I can't utter.

No!

There are complications
in both our lives, you see?

02:56.041 --> 02:58.791
When you were born,
your father was far away.

02:59.625 --> 03:03.208
He's at a great distance, even now,
and I worry for his safety.

But in our hearts, we're wed.

03:09.625 --> 03:11.208
We're husband and wife.

03:14.333 --> 03:17.083
Though we scorn convention
and will not acquiesce to it.

You, Norma Jeane!
You slept right in this very drawer.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.875
We were so poor,
this drawer was your crib.

20:39.208 --> 20:40.833
Come back here, Norma Jeane.

20:42.625 --> 20:43.833
[screaming continues]

20:46.375 --> 20:49.833
Hey. It's okay.

20:50.708 --> 20:51.708
[screams]

20:57.291 --> 20:58.250
[breathing heavily]

21:03.750 --> 21:04.708
It's okay.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.500
-[playwright] It's all right, Norma Jeane.
-[sighs]

21:20.583 --> 21:23.500
[playwright] Hey. Everything's all right.

21:24.625 --> 21:25.458
[exhales]

21:26.541 --> 21:31.041
[playwright] Norma Jeane?
What were you thinking of?

21:33.958 --> 21:35.250
I wasn't thinking.

21:36.416 --> 21:37.333
[chuckles softly]

21:40.458 --> 21:41.791
Um, maybe…

21:42.416 --> 21:43.583
[sighs, sniffles]

21:44.458 --> 21:47.083
…I was remembering?

21:48.291 --> 21:49.666
[bell buzzes]

21:54.166 --> 21:56.666
-[machine beeps]
-[bell rings]

22:00.250 --> 22:01.208
[sighs]

22:08.750 --> 22:12.291
I… I read the script, the whole script.

22:13.625 --> 22:18.916
It's, um…
such a strange, disturbing story.

22:20.125 --> 22:23.833
This mentally unbalanced woman
almost killing a little girl.

22:25.666 --> 22:29.291
Like a novel by Dostoyevsky,
where you feel sympathy for the criminal

22:30.125 --> 22:31.875
and don't wish to see her punished.

22:33.333 --> 22:36.416
[director] Oh, you've read Dostoyevsky,
have you, honey?

22:37.541 --> 22:39.708
[chuckles] All right.

22:42.625 --> 22:46.083
-[man coughs]
-[Norma Jeane clears throat]

22:46.166 --> 22:49.041
[director] Well, Miss Monroe,
let's, uh… let's begin.

23:02.583 --> 23:03.583
Miss Monroe?

23:04.166 --> 23:05.625
[breath trembling]

23:39.041 --> 23:42.041
You go back now. Go back.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.166
[man] "She yours?"

23:45.166 --> 23:48.500
No. She doesn't belong to me.

23:50.208 --> 23:53.916
This isn't your room.
You go back in there and go to sleep.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.833
[man] "She's crying."

23:57.666 --> 24:00.208
If you don't pay
any attention to them, they stop.

24:04.291 --> 24:08.541
"I think I'd better leave
before twins pop out of the closet."

24:14.250 --> 24:16.333
But you haven't any reason to leave now.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.500
"Sure, I have. I want to."

24:24.916 --> 24:26.125
I'll go with you.

24:27.541 --> 24:30.833
-Let's go dancing.
-[man] "What's the matter with you?"

24:31.791 --> 24:33.916
"You're supposed
to be here with that kid."

24:36.291 --> 24:37.291
Then stay.

24:39.291 --> 24:41.083
She won't bother you anymore.

24:42.416 --> 24:43.583
[man] "You bother me."

24:44.583 --> 24:45.958
"I can't figure you out."

24:54.833 --> 24:56.666
I'll be any way you want me to be.

24:57.958 --> 25:02.250
[man] "Why? Why is it so important?"

25:02.333 --> 25:03.625
Because…

25:05.916 --> 25:08.541
I belong with you, Philip.

25:12.958 --> 25:15.083
I didn't think you were ever coming back.

25:17.125 --> 25:18.250
"I'm Jed, Nell."

25:20.125 --> 25:21.791
"I'm not the man you think I am."

25:23.666 --> 25:24.500
"Remember?"

25:25.916 --> 25:27.166
"Remember Philip?"

25:33.125 --> 25:34.000
Yes.

25:36.416 --> 25:40.708
[man] "Now, think back."

25:45.375 --> 25:46.375
"Think."

25:49.583 --> 25:52.666
"What did he look like?"

25:59.500 --> 26:01.125
[Norma Jeane gasps] He had…

26:03.916 --> 26:05.041
brown eyes.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.750
Shiny black hair.

26:21.083 --> 26:24.750
"I'm not Philip. I'm Jed, Nell."

26:26.291 --> 26:27.750
"I'm Jed."

26:31.166 --> 26:32.666
People's names…

26:35.375 --> 26:36.666
You're not him.

26:41.666 --> 26:42.916
You never were.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.666
Thank you, Miss Monroe.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.125
[sniffles]

27:03.916 --> 27:04.750
[exhales]

27:06.666 --> 27:08.500
Please. [exhales]

27:09.541 --> 27:10.708
Can I try again?

27:12.333 --> 27:13.166
Oh…

27:16.125 --> 27:19.416
I… [exhales] I know I could be Nell.

27:20.916 --> 27:22.250
I think I am Nell.

27:23.416 --> 27:24.833
She's a sleepwalker.

27:25.625 --> 27:29.583
She doesn't see him.
She sees her dead fiancé.

27:29.666 --> 27:31.250
She's trapped in delusion.

27:33.041 --> 27:35.541
But where does dreaming end
and madness begin?

27:37.625 --> 27:41.791
Anyway, isn't all love based on delusion?

27:44.916 --> 27:47.916
[whispers] It was beautiful…
[continues indistinctly]

27:48.458 --> 27:51.875
-I really wanted…
-Thank you, John. Thank you, gentlemen.

27:51.958 --> 27:53.083
[man] That was, uh…

27:53.166 --> 27:54.541
We'll hear from you.

27:54.625 --> 27:56.000
[man] …pretty bad, wasn't it?

27:59.416 --> 28:00.458
Like, um,

28:02.166 --> 28:04.250
watching a mental patient, maybe.

28:05.041 --> 28:07.666
Not acting. No technique.

28:07.750 --> 28:11.000
People like that, you can see
why they're drawn to acting.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.875
Because the actor in her role
always knows who she is.

28:14.791 --> 28:15.958
What do you think, boss?

28:16.458 --> 28:17.833
[director coughing]

28:20.833 --> 28:21.791
Sweet Jesus.

28:23.458 --> 28:25.166
Look at the ass on that little girl.

28:45.083 --> 28:47.791
[Norma Jeane] Are you sure a visit
with her won't be too upsetting?

28:48.958 --> 28:52.208
[doctor] Upsetting to your mother
or to you, Miss Baker?

28:58.000 --> 29:00.250
I haven't seen my mother in ten years.

29:02.416 --> 29:03.916
[patients shouting]

29:15.625 --> 29:17.833
Those are some
of our more troubled patients.

29:21.208 --> 29:22.416
Here we are.

29:40.041 --> 29:41.250
Oh, Mother.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.125
[sobbing]

30:20.416 --> 30:21.500
Mother?

30:25.833 --> 30:29.458
Mother, it's me. It's me, Norma Jeane.

30:37.291 --> 30:38.916
[sniffles, exhales tearfully]

31:17.583 --> 31:19.500
Mother, it's so nice here.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.375
Isn't it nice here?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.291
Are you warmer now?

31:49.625 --> 31:52.166
Oh, this shawl, it's so pretty on you.

32:13.375 --> 32:16.125
It's been so exciting this past year.

32:17.250 --> 32:20.291
So wonderful. Like a fairy tale.

32:22.666 --> 32:24.416
Sometimes, I can't believe it.

32:32.208 --> 32:34.458
I'm under contract at the studio.

32:35.250 --> 32:36.750
Where you used to work.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.875
I can make a living
just being photographed.

32:57.458 --> 33:00.083
I guess there isn't
any Norma Jeane, is there?

33:11.833 --> 33:12.666
Mother?

33:19.250 --> 33:22.500
My father was under contract
to the studio, you said.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.750
Around 1925?

33:31.875 --> 33:35.750
I've been sneaking around there
trying to find his picture in the files--

33:35.833 --> 33:37.166
[mother] Where's my daughter?

33:38.208 --> 33:40.000
They said my daughter was coming.

33:41.291 --> 33:42.708
I don't know you. Who are you?

34:54.625 --> 34:56.208
[director] And cut.

34:58.833 --> 35:03.166
[mother] Yes, cut. Don't be a coward. Cut.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.291
Do it!

35:11.583 --> 35:13.083
[indistinct chatter]

35:21.791 --> 35:22.833
[man] You all right?

35:25.250 --> 35:26.208
Hey.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.583
Hey, what's wrong? You okay?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.500
Dee-Dee, it's okay. I have it.
We're fine, thank you.

35:38.250 --> 35:40.041
-[Norma Jeane cries]
-[man] Oh, dear.

35:42.250 --> 35:44.916
Hey, that's all right.
Everything is okay. Thank you.

35:45.750 --> 35:46.750
Give us a second.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.541
[breathing heavily]

35:50.625 --> 35:53.875
[announcer] Marilyn Monroe,
a rising new Hollywood talent

35:53.958 --> 35:57.916
proves herself a strong dynamic presence
in this darkly disturbing thriller.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.833
Also starring Richard Widmark.

35:59.916 --> 36:03.875
Her portrayal
of a mentally unbalanced young babysitter

36:03.958 --> 36:05.416
is so chillingly convincing--

36:05.500 --> 36:10.875
Mr. Shinn, at the premiere,
I shut my eyes a lot.

36:12.083 --> 36:14.500
I couldn't believe that girl was me.

36:15.250 --> 36:18.833
But everyone in the audience
would think it was me, Nell.

36:20.583 --> 36:23.958
And later at the party, Marilyn.

36:25.666 --> 36:27.708
[Shinn over telephone]
Are you on painkillers?

36:28.708 --> 36:30.000
Is it your period?

36:31.958 --> 36:32.791
Oh.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.916
No. No, it's not.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.000
Um, what business of yours--

36:38.083 --> 36:41.708
[Shinn] Sweetheart, the next film
is going to be terrific, I promise you.

36:41.791 --> 36:44.166
A whole lot classier than Don't Bother,

36:44.250 --> 36:47.958
which I think is a stagy piece of crap
except for you, but don't quote me.

36:50.708 --> 36:54.708
["Für Elise" playing on piano]

37:38.083 --> 37:40.708
["Für Elise" ends]

37:43.833 --> 37:46.833
[ethereal melody playing on piano]

38:13.708 --> 38:15.833
[man 1] Marilyn deserves better than this.

38:18.416 --> 38:20.166
Marilyn is gonna be a star.

38:22.375 --> 38:23.458
[sniffs]

38:26.416 --> 38:27.666
This place…

38:28.958 --> 38:30.375
Know what it smells of?

38:31.833 --> 38:34.500
Dreary old love-paste.

38:35.750 --> 38:39.333
Nothing more dreary
than rancid old love-paste.

38:43.333 --> 38:45.708
You know, we've performed in porn films.

38:47.250 --> 38:49.625
Just for the hell of it. Not for cash.

38:50.250 --> 38:53.416
I didn't sneer at the cash. I never do.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.916
-[man 2 chuckles]
-She's a prude.

39:01.375 --> 39:03.708
Miss Golden Dreams of all people.

39:04.625 --> 39:05.583
[pills rattle]

39:12.333 --> 39:14.916
The human body is meant to be seen.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.625
Admired and…

39:25.625 --> 39:26.583
desired.

39:32.250 --> 39:37.166
Not hidden away
like some ugly festering wound.

39:38.208 --> 39:40.750
[man 1] There's plenty of bodies
that should be hidden away.

39:40.833 --> 39:43.333
But not yours, Cassie, and not mine.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.916
And for sure not our girl Norma's.

39:48.791 --> 39:50.208
What are you doing?

39:52.000 --> 39:53.416
Are you looking at her?

39:58.166 --> 39:59.375
Can you see her?

40:02.666 --> 40:04.750
I like to watch myself in the mirror.

40:06.666 --> 40:09.083
I like to watch myself on the toilet even.

40:12.250 --> 40:16.208
In our household, my father, Chaplin,

40:17.333 --> 40:18.791
was all the magic.

40:20.333 --> 40:22.208
He drew all the light into himself

40:22.291 --> 40:25.041
until there was
nothing left inside me but numbness.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.250
Like sleep.

40:28.958 --> 40:31.291
Only in the mirror could I see myself.

40:33.125 --> 40:34.750
Anything I did in the mirror,

40:36.250 --> 40:40.125
I could hear waves and waves of applause.

40:40.208 --> 40:43.000
[ethereal music playing]

40:45.500 --> 40:46.708
Look, Norma Jeane.

40:51.625 --> 40:52.833
There she is.

40:54.833 --> 40:56.041
Your magic friend.

42:03.791 --> 42:05.541
[Cass] Were you waiting for us?

42:08.666 --> 42:09.791
Norma?

42:13.416 --> 42:14.250
Yes.

42:16.083 --> 42:17.416
Were you starved for us?

42:19.291 --> 42:20.291
Yes.

42:22.250 --> 42:24.416
But don't be nice to us.

42:26.708 --> 42:29.166
[man 1] Yeah. Like feeding a cobra.

42:29.875 --> 42:32.208
I'd use a ten-foot stick on me, myself.

just as she lived for love.

43:13.708 --> 43:17.958
Like a Lorelei, flaunting her charms
as she lured men on and on

43:18.041 --> 43:19.875
to their eternal destruction.

43:21.208 --> 43:24.833
It's Marilyn Monroe,
skyrocketing to new dramatic heights.

43:24.916 --> 43:27.541
When a man
took her loveliness in his arms,

Just anybody handy, as long as he's a man.

43:39.333 --> 43:40.583
That is not our Norma.

That's not our little Fishie.

[announcer] But she could never be his
nor any man's completely.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.875
And that thought whipped him into a frenzy

45:25.875 --> 45:28.958
"Young men-about-town, Charlie Chaplin Jr.

45:29.583 --> 45:32.166
and Edward G. Robinson Jr."

45:34.000 --> 45:37.666
"And blonde sexpot, Marilyn Monroe."

45:38.166 --> 45:39.083
"A threesome."

45:39.166 --> 45:40.500
[Eddy chuckles]

45:40.583 --> 45:41.833
How vulgar.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.208
"A sexpot."

45:46.875 --> 45:48.416
What is a "sexpot"?

45:49.666 --> 45:54.000
Is this the sexpot?

45:54.083 --> 45:54.958
[chuckles]

45:55.041 --> 45:56.250
-No!
-Or this?

45:56.333 --> 45:58.875
[shrieks] No! No!

45:58.958 --> 46:01.291
[shouting indistinctly]

46:02.416 --> 46:04.958
No! [laughing]

46:07.458 --> 46:10.208
I don't want you seen
in public with them, Norma Jeane.

46:15.125 --> 46:16.416
And in private?

46:20.125 --> 46:21.375
In private…

46:24.333 --> 46:25.791
take precautions.

46:25.875 --> 46:27.833
Oh, Mr. Shinn, that's so cruel.

46:28.791 --> 46:31.916
It's crude and cruel.
And you… you know it.

46:32.666 --> 46:36.833
I'm just thinking of your career
and your well-being.

46:38.666 --> 46:40.041
You're thinking of Marilyn.

46:40.791 --> 46:42.625
-[Shinn] Yes.
-Her career.

46:42.708 --> 46:46.125
Yes. And her well-being.

46:46.750 --> 46:48.583
She doesn't have any well-being.

46:50.333 --> 46:51.666
She's only a career.

46:55.625 --> 46:57.125
They know I'm Norma.

46:58.125 --> 46:59.208
Not Marilyn.

47:01.875 --> 47:03.500
They understand me.

47:05.041 --> 47:08.625
I understand you. I invented you.

47:13.541 --> 47:14.416
[chuckles]

47:16.500 --> 47:18.125
[Cass] Oh, Norma.

47:20.875 --> 47:22.375
I guess I do love you.

47:24.791 --> 47:26.333
I'm jealous of you and Eddy.

47:28.708 --> 47:30.666
Jealous of anybody who looks at you.

47:33.958 --> 47:36.375
If I could love any woman,

47:37.833 --> 47:38.875
it'd be you.

47:41.791 --> 47:43.250
When you say you love me

47:44.958 --> 47:46.208
and when you look at me…

47:49.291 --> 47:52.750
who do you see, truly?

47:53.541 --> 47:55.541
The Little Tramp? Do you see him?

47:56.458 --> 47:57.416
No.

47:58.958 --> 48:00.250
I see only you.

48:05.333 --> 48:09.708
People think it's a blessing
being Charlie Chaplin's son.

48:11.333 --> 48:14.750
Like it's a fairy tale,
and I'm the king's son.

48:15.916 --> 48:17.541
But we're cursed, Eddy and me.

48:21.083 --> 48:24.208
We're juniors… of men who never wanted us.

48:29.416 --> 48:31.541
But at least you two have fathers.

48:32.916 --> 48:34.541
At least you know who you are.

48:36.791 --> 48:40.166
[smacks lips] Oh, we knew
who we were before we were born.

48:42.083 --> 48:43.583
You never knew your father.

48:44.666 --> 48:45.875
So you're free.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.416
You can invent yourself.

48:50.708 --> 48:52.208
I love your name.

48:52.833 --> 48:55.125
-Marilyn Monroe.
-[Eddy] Mm-hmm.

48:55.916 --> 48:58.458
[chuckling] It's so totally phony.

48:58.541 --> 49:00.083
-[Eddy laughs]
-I love it.

49:02.666 --> 49:05.083
Like you gave birth to yourself.

49:07.416 --> 49:09.125
[Norma Jeane] Because of his eyes.

49:09.625 --> 49:11.750
He had the most beautiful eyes.

49:12.750 --> 49:15.208
Because he'd gazed upon me
with those eyes.

49:16.041 --> 49:18.375
Haunting, soulful eyes.

49:18.458 --> 49:20.958
From a wall
of Mother's long-ago apartment.

49:23.208 --> 49:25.666
Because he would say, seeing me…

49:26.583 --> 49:28.750
I knew you as soon as I saw you.

49:31.833 --> 49:33.083
Fatherless.

49:34.708 --> 49:35.833
Like me.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.833
And then your mother abandoned…

49:42.250 --> 49:43.458
and debased.

49:44.166 --> 49:45.291
Like mine.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.916
[Norma Jeane] Because he would love me
as other men would not.

49:51.875 --> 49:52.958
Or could not.

49:54.083 --> 49:55.333
As a twin.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.666
With his soul.

49:57.750 --> 49:58.958
There's Gemini.

50:00.166 --> 50:01.166
See?

50:03.083 --> 50:04.750
Both Norma and I are Geminis.

50:06.416 --> 50:07.875
The fated twins.

50:12.083 --> 50:13.083
Where?

50:13.958 --> 50:17.083
-I don't see it. Where?
-There.

50:22.166 --> 50:24.125
It's all billions of years old.

50:25.583 --> 50:27.208
Unimaginably vast.

50:28.625 --> 50:30.041
Yet it began out of what?

50:32.041 --> 50:35.083
Particles so small
it couldn't be seen by the human eye.

50:36.833 --> 50:39.708
[Norma Jeane] Look at them up there,
shining so brightly.

50:42.083 --> 50:44.458
And yet, each one is so very much alone.

50:46.958 --> 50:48.250
I'll drink to that.

50:53.958 --> 50:57.000
Let's vow, okay? The three of us.

50:58.291 --> 51:01.291
To always love each other like right now.

51:02.166 --> 51:04.291
And to die for each other, if needed.

51:06.666 --> 51:07.875
We're a triangle.

51:09.458 --> 51:12.333
A triangle can't be divided in two,
like two can be.

51:13.875 --> 51:17.541
We're the Gemini, the three of us.

51:17.625 --> 51:20.458
Like twins. But there's three.

51:20.541 --> 51:21.875
[chuckles]

51:21.958 --> 51:22.958
[laughs]

51:28.000 --> 51:29.208
To the Gemini.

51:33.541 --> 51:34.750
To the Gemini.

51:36.458 --> 51:39.000
[ethereal music playing]

52:07.500 --> 52:08.333
[sobs]

52:12.208 --> 52:14.541
Oh God, I knew.

52:16.958 --> 52:21.750
I guess I knew.
I've been feeling so swollen and so happy.

52:21.833 --> 52:23.333

52:23.416 --> 52:25.291
[doctor] My dear, you're healthy.

52:27.041 --> 52:28.625
Everything's gonna be fine.

52:31.291 --> 52:33.041
I'm happy, I said.

52:34.250 --> 52:36.375
I want this baby.

52:36.458 --> 52:40.208
My husband and I have been trying
for years. [clears throat]

52:40.916 --> 52:41.791
[laughs]

52:46.541 --> 52:47.958
[panting]

52:50.500 --> 52:51.500
[chuckling] Hey, Norma.

52:55.041 --> 52:59.125
What is it? You look… fraught. And happy.

52:59.208 --> 53:00.583
[Norma Jeane exclaims]

53:06.541 --> 53:07.625
Oh, Norma…

53:09.791 --> 53:10.916
You think you are?

53:15.291 --> 53:17.375
-Is this what I think it is?
-Yes!

53:18.458 --> 53:20.291
[Eddy laughing] Oh, man!

53:24.083 --> 53:25.458
Are you happy for me?

53:27.416 --> 53:30.041
Us? The Gemini, I mean?

53:34.041 --> 53:35.541
-Yes!
-Yes!

53:35.625 --> 53:37.625
[Cass and Norma Jeane chuckling]

53:45.208 --> 53:46.541
It's like the movies.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.666
The kind of thing that only happens
in the movies.

53:50.750 --> 53:51.625
What?

53:54.416 --> 53:56.083
[Norma Jeane] That little tiger.

53:56.166 --> 53:58.291
[chuckles] Oh!

54:01.291 --> 54:02.208
[sigh

54:03.333 --> 54:04.791
I had one like him once.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.208
A long time ago when I was a little girl.

54:09.750 --> 54:11.208
Baby's first plaything.

54:12.916 --> 54:13.750
Cute.

54:16.500 --> 54:19.500
Cass, where are you taking us?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.333
I wanna go home.

54:23.916 --> 54:24.916
Right?

54:26.250 --> 54:27.750
Baby's so sleepy.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.916
Oh, this is a vision for baby to see.

54:34.541 --> 54:35.541
Just wait.

54:44.416 --> 54:47.833
Norma, you can look or not,

54:49.083 --> 54:52.958
but… there she is.

54:54.916 --> 54:56.500
Mmm… Marilyn.

54:56.583 --> 54:57.500
Marilyn.

55:08.708 --> 55:10.541
[Norma Jeane] I can't take the role.

55:11.208 --> 55:12.500
I'm sorry.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.875
[Shinn over telephone]
Are you still on the line?

55:19.125 --> 55:20.333
Is something wrong?

55:21.000 --> 55:22.833
[Norma Jeane] No, nothing's wrong.

55:23.333 --> 55:24.625
I just can't.

55:25.625 --> 55:26.458
Not now.

55:27.250 --> 55:30.791
[Shinn] Not now? Why not now?

55:33.291 --> 55:37.000
You're the newest
box office sensation now.

55:37.875 --> 55:42.958
Zanuck has bought
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes for you.

55:43.041 --> 55:46.666
He wants it as a showcase for you.

55:50.458 --> 55:51.750
How much would I get?

55:56.708 --> 55:58.291
[Shinn] Your contract salary.

55:59.541 --> 56:00.791
Five hundred a week.

56:05.208 --> 56:07.291
How much would Jane Russell get?

56:09.208 --> 56:10.750
[Shinn] The deal is pending.

56:11.250 --> 56:13.500
And Russell has to be lent
by another studio.

56:16.375 --> 56:17.875
Yes, but how much?

56:18.541 --> 56:20.916
[Shinn scoffs] The figures
aren't finalized.

56:21.000 --> 56:21.916
How much?

56:24.583 --> 56:29.166
[Shinn] They're asking… $100,000.

56:32.416 --> 56:34.083
$100,000?

56:39.125 --> 56:43.416
I'll get about $5,000,
and Jane Russell gets $100,000?

56:44.041 --> 56:48.500
And I'm playing the blonde
in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes?

56:50.375 --> 56:51.625
That's an insult.

56:53.458 --> 56:56.958
-I'm gonna hang up now. Goodbye.
-[Shinn] Marilyn, wait.

56:57.041 --> 56:59.208
Fuck Marilyn. She's not here.

[chuckles softly]

"To My Baby."

57:30.416 --> 57:31.416
In you

57:32.916 --> 57:38.291
The world is born anew

57:40.958 --> 57:42.166
Before you

57:44.166 --> 57:47.333
There was none

57:49.875 --> 57:51.958
How'd you like to be a grandmother?

57:54.375 --> 57:55.708
[Mother] What year is it?

57:56.833 --> 57:58.458
What time did we travel to?

58:01.375 --> 58:03.916
Mother, it's May 1953.

58:06.125 --> 58:07.333
I'm Norma Jeane.

58:08.375 --> 58:10.000
I'm here to take care of you.

58:12.291 --> 58:13.708
But your hair is so white.

58:14.625 --> 58:16.166
[Norma Jeane chuckles softly]

58:24.500 --> 58:28.333
When you had me, Mother,
you weren't married, I guess.

58:29.291 --> 58:31.708
You didn't have a man supporting you.

58:33.500 --> 58:34.916
And you had a baby.

58:45.666 --> 58:46.958
That was so brave.

58:50.416 --> 58:51.833
Another girl would've…

58:54.750 --> 58:58.083
well, you know, gotten rid of it.

58:59.833 --> 59:00.791
Of me.

59:03.958 --> 59:08.333
And I wouldn't be here at all.
There wouldn't be any Marilyn.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.250
And she's getting so famous now.

But you were brave.

59:44.291 --> 59:45.916
You did the right thing.

You had your baby.

1:22:02.125 --> 1:22:03.416
Oh. Um…

1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:05.916
Is this to eat?

1:22:06.750 --> 1:22:08.125
I mean, standing up?

1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:10.291
[footsteps approaching]

1:22:13.416 --> 1:22:15.916
So, Marilyn,
what's it like being a movie star?

1:22:17.625 --> 1:22:18.541
Um…

1:22:19.041 --> 1:22:21.083
I'm not a star.

1:22:21.166 --> 1:22:23.000
I'm just some blonde. [chuckles]

1:22:24.041 --> 1:22:25.416
So the hair's real?

1:22:26.208 --> 1:22:27.416
No, no.

1:22:29.750 --> 1:22:32.125
[all laughing]

1:22:38.625 --> 1:22:40.875
[Norma Jeane] Daddy, it's so scary

1:22:41.625 --> 1:22:44.833
how a scene with actual people

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:48.791
just goes on and on.

1:22:49.583 --> 1:22:50.791
Like on a bus.

1:22:54.208 --> 1:22:55.541
What's to stop it?

1:22:56.375 --> 1:22:57.208
Or…

1:22:58.875 --> 1:23:02.125
Or how to figure out what people mean

1:23:02.208 --> 1:23:04.500
when probably they don't mean anything.

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.041
-[baseball bat cracks]
-[crowd cheering on TV]

1:23:08.125 --> 1:23:09.458
Not like a script.

1:23:10.916 --> 1:23:12.375
There's no point.

1:23:13.958 --> 1:23:14.916
[sighs]

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.416
It just happens.

1:23:19.375 --> 1:23:20.791
Like the weather?

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:24.416
Uh…

1:23:26.833 --> 1:23:28.583
You know, honey, in boxing,

1:23:30.250 --> 1:23:32.541
they say, "That got his attention"…

1:23:34.708 --> 1:23:36.416
when a guy gets hit hard.

1:23:38.250 --> 1:23:42.250
Well, it's about attention, honey.
It's about concentration.

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.791
And if you don't have that…

1:24:00.833 --> 1:24:03.500
[announcer speaking indistinctly on TV]

1:24:23.083 --> 1:24:24.083
[grunts]

1:24:35.083 --> 1:24:37.125
I could have you hurt, you cocksuckers.

1:24:40.791 --> 1:24:42.291
-Hey, now.
-[chuckles]

1:24:43.833 --> 1:24:45.583
That's not the right attitude.

1:24:49.333 --> 1:24:51.583
I mean, we're on your side.

1:24:51.666 --> 1:24:54.708
And the lady's too. She's a real…

1:24:55.291 --> 1:24:56.958
High-class lady, in fact.

1:24:57.041 --> 1:24:58.208
[Eddy chuckles]

1:24:58.291 --> 1:25:01.375
What we feel, strongly,

1:25:01.458 --> 1:25:05.250
is that these, uh, negatives,
well, should be off the market.

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:10.000
So they can't be misappropriated.

1:25:12.333 --> 1:25:13.291
[tires screeching]

1:25:23.166 --> 1:25:24.500
[breathing heavily]

1:25:25.625 --> 1:25:26.666
[dog barking]

1:25:34.083 --> 1:25:37.500
[Norma Jeane singing indistinctly
on recording]

1:25:39.583 --> 1:25:41.458
[grunting]

1:25:46.833 --> 1:25:47.958
Where the fuck is…

1:25:51.083 --> 1:25:53.000
Hi, Daddy. Where'd you go to?

1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:54.875
[Norma Jeane gasps, grunts]

1:26:00.541 --> 1:26:03.666
Oh, Daddy. It's my fault.

1:26:04.833 --> 1:26:08.333
I don't know how the room got this way.
I've been sick, I guess.

1:26:13.916 --> 1:26:16.916
Those photos. That's what you are. Meat.

1:26:20.166 --> 1:26:21.250
Daddy, no.

1:26:23.250 --> 1:26:24.916
I don't want to be.

1:26:27.416 --> 1:26:28.583
Tell them you won't.

1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:31.583
This new movie? No deal.

1:26:33.083 --> 1:26:34.750
Daddy, I have to work.

1:26:35.833 --> 1:26:37.250
It's my life.

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.083
You tell them you want better roles.

1:26:42.333 --> 1:26:44.458
More serious roles.
You tell them you're quitting.

1:26:44.541 --> 1:26:47.458
You tell them
your husband says you're quitting.

1:26:48.416 --> 1:26:49.250
Yes.

1:26:50.833 --> 1:26:52.500
Yes, I will tell them.

1:27:15.500 --> 1:27:18.416
Don't you see how much I love you?
Don't you understand?

1:27:18.500 --> 1:27:19.791
I know.

1:27:21.916 --> 1:27:24.500
I can't bear to see you
cheapen yourself like that.

1:27:26.750 --> 1:27:30.458
[Norma Jeane] I just felt so sorry
for the creature at the end.

1:27:31.708 --> 1:27:33.416
"Sorry for the creature"?

1:27:33.916 --> 1:27:36.333
What'd you want him to do? Marry the girl?

1:27:36.416 --> 1:27:40.708
He was kind of scary-looking,
but he wasn't really all bad.

1:27:41.416 --> 1:27:44.541
I think he just craved a little affection,
you know?

1:27:44.625 --> 1:27:47.791
A sense of being loved
and needed and wanted.

1:27:48.666 --> 1:27:50.875
That's a very interesting point of view.

1:27:51.708 --> 1:27:56.791
[exclaims] You feel the breeze
from the subway? Isn't it delicious?

1:27:58.791 --> 1:28:00.750
Sort of cools the ankles, doesn't it?

1:28:02.916 --> 1:28:05.000
What do you think would be fun to do now?

1:28:05.500 --> 1:28:06.500
[director] And cut!

1:28:07.250 --> 1:28:10.208
[crowd cheering and whistling]

1:28:13.916 --> 1:28:17.416
[pensive music playing]

1:29:19.875 --> 1:29:21.375
Isn't it delicious?

1:29:21.458 --> 1:29:23.750
[whistling]

1:29:42.458 --> 1:29:45.416
[cheering and whistling continues]

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:37.291
[breathing heavily]

1:30:39.250 --> 1:30:40.250
Daddy?

1:30:45.083 --> 1:30:47.666
Daddy, gosh, I'm sorry.

1:30:48.708 --> 1:30:50.875
-Keeping you waiting so long.
-There she is.

1:30:52.958 --> 1:30:55.250
You proud of yourself, hmm?

1:30:55.833 --> 1:30:56.708
[Norma Jeane] No.

1:30:56.791 --> 1:30:58.375
Are you proud of yourself, huh?

1:30:58.458 --> 1:31:00.791
-Daddy, don't…
-Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

1:31:00.875 --> 1:31:02.250
-Please…
-Proud of yourself?

1:31:02.333 --> 1:31:04.041
-What? Huh? Huh?
-No.

1:31:04.125 --> 1:31:06.541
-I'm workin' tomorrow.
-Showing off your crotch?

1:31:06.625 --> 1:31:08.000
-Please don't.
-Huh? Huh?

1:31:08.083 --> 1:31:11.333
You think that shit works on me?
Think that works on me? Oh, yeah?

1:31:11.416 --> 1:31:14.583
Everybody, they're gonna fuckin' know
what a fuckin' whore you are!

1:31:14.666 --> 1:31:17.000
Fuckin' get up! Huh? Huh?

1:31:17.083 --> 1:31:19.625
-[glass shatters]
-You fucking whore! Huh?

1:31:19.708 --> 1:31:22.625
-Get over here! Get over here!
-[Norma Jeane whimpers]

1:31:22.708 --> 1:31:24.541
[father] My dear daughter, Norma Jeane.

1:31:24.625 --> 1:31:25.541
[glass shatters]

1:31:26.416 --> 1:31:28.333
I did not see your new movie.

1:31:29.666 --> 1:31:32.791
Its vulgar title
and publicity attending it,

1:31:32.875 --> 1:31:35.166
these giant billboards
of your crude likeness

1:31:35.250 --> 1:31:36.833
posed with your dress lifted up

1:31:36.916 --> 1:31:39.416
for all the world
to see your private parts,

1:31:39.500 --> 1:31:41.791
did not make me wish to purchase a ticket.

1:31:45.625 --> 1:31:48.541
-[whipping]
-Fuckin'… Huh?

1:31:48.625 --> 1:31:50.875
[father] I had hoped to meet your husband.

1:31:51.375 --> 1:31:53.375
I've long been an admirer of his.

1:31:53.458 --> 1:31:54.458
[thudding]

1:31:54.958 --> 1:31:58.708
I was disappointed that your marriage
to such a stellar athlete

1:31:58.791 --> 1:32:01.750
ended in divorce and such ugly publicity.

1:32:04.416 --> 1:32:07.125
At least there are no children
to reap the shame.

1:32:33.708 --> 1:32:34.750
My Magda.

1:32:38.500 --> 1:32:39.625
My Magda.

1:32:41.208 --> 1:32:44.916
Magda. Magda. Magda.

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:48.708
Magda. Magda. Magda.

1:32:50.916 --> 1:32:52.000
Magda.

1:32:55.458 --> 1:32:57.916
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

1:33:40.750 --> 1:33:41.833
Marilyn Monroe?

1:33:44.166 --> 1:33:45.083
Here?

1:33:47.750 --> 1:33:49.500
Magda? Her?

1:33:50.875 --> 1:33:55.375
"When I dream of back there,
I dream of the smell of laundry."

1:33:56.708 --> 1:34:02.500
"The tub overflowing and the poem I wrote,
'Magda,' floating, soaked."

1:34:03.416 --> 1:34:05.375
"I'm frantically trying
to collect the pages

1:34:05.458 --> 1:34:08.708
before the ink runs in streaks
and the poem comes apart in my hands."

1:34:08.791 --> 1:34:09.625
Oh.

1:34:10.541 --> 1:34:11.875
He's in love with her.

1:34:12.750 --> 1:34:14.500
[man] "These words I wrote her…"

1:34:14.583 --> 1:34:16.333
"Two hundred words."

1:34:16.416 --> 1:34:19.208
"A kind of… prayer."

1:34:21.041 --> 1:34:24.208
"And I wake in Brooklyn,
nearly 40 years later,

1:34:24.291 --> 1:34:25.916
my heart knocking in my chest."

1:34:27.125 --> 1:34:29.666
"And I remember her face, blushing,

1:34:30.750 --> 1:34:34.416
and her beautiful wide-set eyes
looking up from the poem, and saying…"

1:34:37.625 --> 1:34:38.625
[inhales sharply]

1:34:40.666 --> 1:34:42.000
Not my Magda.

1:34:42.708 --> 1:34:45.291
[applause]

1:36:03.083 --> 1:36:05.916
[playwright] Magda was my own first love.

1:36:08.916 --> 1:36:10.416
Never consummated.

1:36:12.541 --> 1:36:14.708
Never even really declared. [chuckles]

1:36:16.208 --> 1:36:17.041
Um…

1:36:18.958 --> 1:36:20.208
She would be,

1:36:21.958 --> 1:36:25.750
if she was even still alive,
in her… in her mid-fifties.

1:36:28.541 --> 1:36:29.791
Beautiful Magda.

1:36:31.166 --> 1:36:32.125
Middle-aged.

1:36:41.833 --> 1:36:42.666
I…

1:36:43.916 --> 1:36:47.416
I had some ideas about Magda,

1:36:48.416 --> 1:36:49.708
if you're interested.

1:36:51.875 --> 1:36:53.375
Of course I'm interested.

1:36:55.791 --> 1:36:57.291
It's very good of you to care.

1:37:00.750 --> 1:37:07.166
Um, this girl, Magda,
she's like Natasha in The Three Sisters.

1:37:07.250 --> 1:37:10.166
The one they laugh at
because her dress is the wrong color.

1:37:10.791 --> 1:37:13.416
Except, with Magda,
it's the way she speaks English.

1:37:16.500 --> 1:37:18.208
Who told you that?

1:37:20.875 --> 1:37:21.708
What?

1:37:23.500 --> 1:37:26.333
About The Three Sisters and my play?

1:37:33.375 --> 1:37:35.458
-Nobody.
-Kazan?

1:37:37.291 --> 1:37:38.916
That I'd been influenced?

1:37:40.625 --> 1:37:41.833
Uh, no.

1:37:44.250 --> 1:37:47.375
No, I read the play myself.

1:37:48.833 --> 1:37:50.125
I always thought I…

1:37:54.208 --> 1:37:56.583
I always thought I could play Natasha.

1:38:02.750 --> 1:38:08.416
I was thinking,
what Chekhov does with Natasha, he… he…

1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:10.791
[clears throat] He… he surprises you,

1:38:12.166 --> 1:38:16.083
because Natasha turns out to be
so strong and devious.

1:38:17.125 --> 1:38:18.208
And cruel.

1:38:20.166 --> 1:38:24.125
But your Magda, she never changes much.

1:38:24.208 --> 1:38:25.916
She's always so good.

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000
Yes.

1:38:28.041 --> 1:38:29.125
Magda is good.

1:38:29.958 --> 1:38:31.500
Was good. The original.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.291
She wouldn't dream of being cruel.

1:38:39.375 --> 1:38:40.208
Yeah.

1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.541
And, uh, you have
any other thoughts about Magda?

1:38:52.791 --> 1:38:53.625
Hmm?

1:38:59.833 --> 1:39:01.250
One thing I was thinking,

1:39:02.708 --> 1:39:04.458
Magda wouldn't know how to read.

1:39:05.666 --> 1:39:08.916
Isaac shows his poem to her,
and she's only pretending to read it.

1:39:09.833 --> 1:39:10.666
[gasps]

1:39:14.250 --> 1:39:15.458
Oh my God.

1:39:18.125 --> 1:39:20.250
She was illiterate. That's what it was.

1:39:24.333 --> 1:39:25.291
Of course.

1:39:28.875 --> 1:39:31.083
Well, thank you. Thank you.

1:39:32.250 --> 1:39:33.083
[sniffles]

1:39:37.708 --> 1:39:39.083
Uh, what…

1:39:39.916 --> 1:39:43.416
I… I suppose I should call you Marilyn,
shouldn't I?

1:39:46.250 --> 1:39:48.000
Or is that just a stage name?

1:39:48.083 --> 1:39:49.250
[chuckles]

1:39:49.333 --> 1:39:50.791
You could call me Norma.

1:39:51.916 --> 1:39:53.291
That's my true name.

1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:57.250
I could call you Norma, if you prefer.

1:39:59.958 --> 1:40:02.833
Or, uh, I could call you, uh…

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:06.041
my Magda.

1:40:10.041 --> 1:40:11.083
I'd like that.

1:40:12.083 --> 1:40:13.541
My secret Magda.

1:40:14.541 --> 1:40:15.375
Yes.

1:40:16.333 --> 1:40:19.416
But maybe "Marilyn" when others are around

1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:22.083
so there wouldn't be
any misunderstandings.

1:40:22.166 --> 1:40:25.125
When others are around,
it doesn't matter what you call me.

1:40:25.208 --> 1:40:26.375
You can whistle.

1:40:27.250 --> 1:40:29.250
You can call me, "Hey, you."

1:40:33.708 --> 1:40:34.791
Hey, you.

1:40:38.291 --> 1:40:39.291
Hey, you.

1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.291
[fanfare playing]

1:40:45.375 --> 1:40:47.416
[announcer] Putting an end
to all speculation,

1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:52.166
Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe
confirmed they will soon marry.

1:40:52.250 --> 1:40:55.333
[reporter] Could you tell us what kind
of a wedding you're going to have?

1:40:55.416 --> 1:40:57.333
Very quiet, I hope.

1:40:57.416 --> 1:41:00.375
[peaceful music playing]

1:41:01.583 --> 1:41:02.583
[laughing]

1:41:03.750 --> 1:41:05.916
Daddy, this is so beautiful!

1:41:06.750 --> 1:41:08.333
I don't ever wanna leave!

1:41:32.875 --> 1:41:34.208
Oh, Daddy!

1:41:36.166 --> 1:41:37.666
I don't ever want to leave.

1:41:46.458 --> 1:41:47.666

1:42:14.708 --> 1:42:15.916
I love you.

1:42:28.333 --> 1:42:30.833
[peaceful music continues]

1:42:51.875 --> 1:42:53.000
Daddy, come on.

1:42:54.583 --> 1:42:58.083
Baby's hungry. He wants his mama to eat.

1:42:58.166 --> 1:42:59.333
[Arthur] Mm, yeah?

1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:00.833
[exclaims]

1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:04.000
[chuckles]

1:43:04.083 --> 1:43:05.708
Baby makes his wishes known.

1:43:06.375 --> 1:43:07.750
Norma's just the vessel.

1:43:08.541 --> 1:43:10.375
[chuckles] Okay.

1:43:10.458 --> 1:43:11.583

1:43:11.666 --> 1:43:13.708
Not after those potatoes. [chuckles]

1:43:19.291 --> 1:43:20.125
[chuckles]

1:43:22.583 --> 1:43:24.458
Am I your good girl, Daddy?

1:43:27.250 --> 1:43:29.666
Yeah. You're my good girl, darling.

1:43:35.125 --> 1:43:36.125
Come here.

1:43:38.791 --> 1:43:40.458
You're my only love.

1:43:42.416 --> 1:43:44.833
[peaceful music playing]

1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:40.125
[Norma Jeane] Daddy, you won't ever
write about me, will you?

1:44:41.333 --> 1:44:43.666
[Arthur] Darling, of course not.

1:44:45.833 --> 1:44:47.291
Why would I do such a thing?

1:44:47.375 --> 1:44:49.083
[Norma Jeane] It's what people do.

1:44:50.291 --> 1:44:51.208
Sometimes.

1:44:52.541 --> 1:44:53.416
Writers.

1:44:54.625 --> 1:44:56.333
[Arthur] I'm not other people.

1:44:57.166 --> 1:44:58.875
You and I are not other people.

1:45:07.791 --> 1:45:08.708
Darling,

1:45:09.625 --> 1:45:11.666
where do you go when you disappear?

1:45:18.375 --> 1:45:19.208
Daddy…

1:45:23.958 --> 1:45:25.625
Don't make me go back.

1:45:28.208 --> 1:45:29.458
[breathing shakily]

1:45:29.541 --> 1:45:31.583
I never wanna be her again.

1:45:37.291 --> 1:45:41.583
I got out with my life last time
but only just barely.

1:45:45.458 --> 1:45:47.208
[Arthur] Yeah, she's wonderful.

1:45:48.833 --> 1:45:50.958
Yeah, pregnancy agrees with her.

1:45:52.250 --> 1:45:54.625
Even morning sickness,
she's cheerful about.

1:45:56.500 --> 1:45:57.916
And then she says, "Oh!"

1:45:58.583 --> 1:46:02.250
"Well, this is how
it's supposed to be, I guess." [chuckles]

1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:08.875
Yeah. Esther was always so cruel.

1:46:10.625 --> 1:46:12.625
It wouldn't occur to Norma to be cruel.

1:46:15.958 --> 1:46:18.041
If I have one regret… [sighs]

1:46:19.291 --> 1:46:21.458
…it's that time passes so quickly.

1:46:26.041 --> 1:46:26.916
[groans]

1:46:32.875 --> 1:46:35.083
[baby] You won't hurt me
this time, will you?

1:46:36.916 --> 1:46:40.500
Not do what you did the last time?

1:46:43.916 --> 1:46:45.041
I didn't.

1:46:48.583 --> 1:46:51.833
-I didn't mean to.
-[baby] Yes, you meant to.

1:46:52.333 --> 1:46:53.541
It was your decision.

1:46:58.416 --> 1:47:00.416
You're not the same baby.

1:47:02.458 --> 1:47:03.916
You're this baby.

1:47:04.750 --> 1:47:08.208
[baby] That was me. It's always me.

1:47:13.166 --> 1:47:14.458
He loves us.

1:47:17.875 --> 1:47:19.208
He would die for us.

1:47:20.541 --> 1:47:21.833
He said so.

1:47:26.625 --> 1:47:28.791
Flowers make people feel welcome.

1:47:30.291 --> 1:47:31.708
Like they're wanted.

1:47:34.791 --> 1:47:36.541
[faucet running]

1:47:56.208 --> 1:47:59.208

a little too short. See?

[sighs]

1:48:03.083 --> 1:48:05.458
What did I… What?

1:48:07.625 --> 1:48:10.750
Well, don't worry,
we can repair the damage. Hmm?

1:48:12.666 --> 1:48:13.625
Come here.

1:48:16.750 --> 1:48:18.291
[man] Where's Norma gone to?

1:48:20.041 --> 1:48:24.166
She's absolutely adorable.
She's nothing like I expected.

1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:26.208
She's so well-read.

1:48:26.291 --> 1:48:29.291
[woman] Yeah, like she's read
Rudy's book. [laughs]

1:48:29.375 --> 1:48:31.291
I'm just glad somebody has.

1:48:32.458 --> 1:48:36.166
[woman] Look at that out there.
Oh my God. Do you guys see that?

1:48:36.250 --> 1:48:37.458
This is incredible.

1:48:47.166 --> 1:48:48.166
Darling…

1:48:49.875 --> 1:48:52.250
Aren't you gonna come down
to the beach with us?

1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:55.000
Why you hiding in here?

1:49:02.750 --> 1:49:06.458
I'm coming, Daddy. I was just…

1:49:06.541 --> 1:49:10.541
Darling, it isn't necessary
to make so much of this visit.

1:49:10.625 --> 1:49:12.041
You know Rudy and Jean.

1:49:19.125 --> 1:49:20.541
But they don't like me.

1:49:21.583 --> 1:49:22.958
They've come to see you.

1:49:24.833 --> 1:49:27.916
Norma, stop being so ridiculous.

1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000
You know they've come to see us both.

1:49:34.375 --> 1:49:38.458
Darling, come down there with me,
huh, will ya? They're waiting.

1:49:45.208 --> 1:49:46.041
Hey.

1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:49.208
Come out there with me.

1:59:44.541 --> 1:59:46.583
[woman] Miss Monroe,
are you coming in today?

1:59:46.666 --> 1:59:47.625
No.

1:59:47.708 --> 1:59:53.416
Marilyn Monroe will not be coming in today
to impersonate and demean herself.

1:59:53.500 --> 1:59:55.583
And you will have to shoot around her.

1:59:56.416 --> 1:59:58.833

2:00:40.666 --> 2:00:44.375
Whitey? Whitey?

2:00:45.708 --> 2:00:48.250
I'm going to conjure Marilyn
within the hour, I promise.

2:00:48.333 --> 2:00:50.500
Come here. It's gonna be all right.

2:00:50.583 --> 2:00:51.708
[sobbing]

2:00:54.333 --> 2:00:56.708
[Norma Jeane breathing heavily]

2:00:58.375 --> 2:01:00.875
[Whitey] Okay. Good.

2:01:05.583 --> 2:01:06.666
Baby's gone.

2:01:19.291 --> 2:01:21.083
Baby's gone, Whitey.

2:01:22.666 --> 2:01:23.541
[Whitey] I know.

2:01:27.875 --> 2:01:28.875
It'll be okay.

2:01:32.625 --> 2:01:34.000
Oh, Miss Monroe.

2:01:50.416 --> 2:01:51.291
Okay.

2:02:01.916 --> 2:02:03.041
[Norma Jeane sobs]

2:02:03.833 --> 2:02:04.750
[Whitey] Here.

2:02:06.541 --> 2:02:07.791
Please come.

2:02:10.625 --> 2:02:13.083
Please come. Don't abandon me.

2:02:14.833 --> 2:02:17.416
-Please.
-[Whitey] She's coming.

2:02:17.500 --> 2:02:18.583
Please come.

2:02:20.250 --> 2:02:21.208
She's coming.

2:02:22.875 --> 2:02:25.458
-Don't abandon me.
-She's coming.

2:02:27.083 --> 2:02:29.333

2:03:18.625 --> 2:03:20.875
[ominous music continues]

2:03:31.458 --> 2:03:34.333
[all clamoring]

2:04:28.416 --> 2:04:30.625
[crowd] Marilyn! Marilyn!

2:04:30.708 --> 2:04:35.666
Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!

2:05:33.833 --> 2:05:35.000
Mwah!

2:05:37.708 --> 2:05:43.500
I love you. I love, love, love you all.

2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:50.833
Mwah!

2:05:50.916 --> 2:05:53.625
[intense music playing]

2:06:05.625 --> 2:06:06.458
[music stops]

2:06:06.541 --> 2:06:08.458
Well, nobody's perfect.

2:06:08.541 --> 2:06:10.916
[dramatic music playing]

2:06:17.416 --> 2:06:19.666
[sped up applause and cheering]

2:06:53.250 --> 2:06:54.583
Champagne, Miss Monroe?

2:06:56.250 --> 2:06:57.625
Yeah, just a little.

2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:00.833
Oh, it's just to help me sleep.

2:07:08.416 --> 2:07:10.375
[ethereal music playing]

2:07:10.458 --> 2:07:11.458
[exhales deeply]

2:07:16.708 --> 2:07:18.833
[father] I see your beautiful face often.

2:07:20.875 --> 2:07:23.125
And I wonder how you look so…

2:07:23.208 --> 2:07:24.625
[camera shutter clicks]

2:07:24.708 --> 2:07:25.958
…untouched.

2:07:30.666 --> 2:07:34.375
But the soul does not always show
in the face, I suppose.

2:07:35.458 --> 2:07:36.625
[all applauding]

2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.625
[cheering]

2:07:54.458 --> 2:07:56.708
[father] Too many years have slipped away.

2:08:01.333 --> 2:08:04.625
And I must see you,
my beautiful lost daughter.

2:08:09.375 --> 2:08:13.250
Before I embark on that long journey
across the sea.

2:08:17.416 --> 2:08:18.708
[vomits, coughing]

2:08:29.750 --> 2:08:31.250
[father] Your tearful father.

2:08:31.333 --> 2:08:33.708
[crowd applauding]

2:08:42.625 --> 2:08:45.083
[ethereal music continues]

2:08:48.708 --> 2:08:51.416
[crowd cheering]

2:09:07.500 --> 2:09:08.541
[woman] Miss Monroe.

2:09:10.083 --> 2:09:11.166
Miss Monroe?

2:09:14.333 --> 2:09:16.541
[sighs] It's so hot in this theater.

2:09:17.250 --> 2:09:19.916
[woman] Miss Monroe? Miss Monroe?

2:09:22.333 --> 2:09:23.583
Hi, Miss Monroe?

2:09:26.250 --> 2:09:28.791
We've landed in New York.

2:09:30.541 --> 2:09:34.333
We're here. Yeah. Let me help you.

2:09:35.458 --> 2:09:36.833
I can take your coat.

2:09:39.083 --> 2:09:41.166
Here, take this. I'll get her to customs.

2:09:43.291 --> 2:09:46.708
Ready? One, two.

2:09:48.875 --> 2:09:50.500
-Yeah.
-Oh, watch your head.

2:09:52.458 --> 2:09:53.416
It's okay.

2:09:55.041 --> 2:09:56.250
Let's go this way.

2:09:59.250 --> 2:10:00.166
Okay.

2:10:03.750 --> 2:10:04.791
Almost there.

2:10:13.541 --> 2:10:14.833
Am I under arrest?

2:10:15.958 --> 2:10:17.333
What will happen to me?

2:10:18.500 --> 2:10:20.208
[breathing heavily]

2:10:26.416 --> 2:10:27.416
[woman] Miss Monroe?

2:10:30.250 --> 2:10:33.708
Miss Monroe?
You don't wanna lay down here. Okay?

2:10:35.041 --> 2:10:36.041
Please.

2:10:38.958 --> 2:10:41.208
-Come on.
-We got her. Up you come.

2:10:56.916 --> 2:11:01.166
It isn't sexual
between the president and me.

2:11:02.875 --> 2:11:05.041
It has very little to do with sex.

2:11:07.166 --> 2:11:08.875
It's a meeting of our souls.

2:11:10.541 --> 2:11:13.458
Oh. Did I say that out loud?

2:11:19.791 --> 2:11:22.500
Your ticket, ma'am,
for your return to LA this evening.

2:11:25.625 --> 2:11:28.250
This evening? But…

2:11:28.333 --> 2:11:31.750
President's plans have changed, ma'am,
so your plans have changed.

2:11:32.916 --> 2:11:36.000
There's an emergency situation
calling him back to Washington.

2:11:37.250 --> 2:11:39.083
He can't stay overnight after all.

2:11:42.625 --> 2:11:43.833
Oh, I see.

2:11:46.791 --> 2:11:49.291
[pensive piano music playing]

2:11:51.250 --> 2:11:53.625
-[agent 1] Step back.
-[agent 2] Give us some space.

2:11:53.708 --> 2:11:54.833
Get back.

2:11:54.916 --> 2:11:57.708
Goddamn it! Jesus!

2:11:57.791 --> 2:12:00.750
-[agent 2] Go somewhere else. Clear.
-[agent 1] We need some room. Excuse us.

2:12:02.208 --> 2:12:03.500
[agent 2] Watch your step, ma'am.

2:12:05.083 --> 2:12:06.666
-[shrieks]
-Watch it.

2:12:08.541 --> 2:12:11.375
[agent 1] Come on, ma'am.
Step along, please, ma'am.

2:12:11.458 --> 2:12:15.708
I can walk myself.
Thank you. I'm not crippled.

2:12:17.250 --> 2:12:18.583
Oh my God!

2:12:18.666 --> 2:12:21.208
[breathing heavily]

2:12:21.291 --> 2:12:22.333
[chuckles]

2:12:22.416 --> 2:12:27.666
Am I meat to be delivered?
Is that what this is? Room service?

2:12:27.750 --> 2:12:28.666
[chuckles]

2:12:30.458 --> 2:12:31.458
[man 1] Hang on.

2:12:32.875 --> 2:12:35.416
[man 2] Would you wish to freshen up,
Miss Monroe?

2:12:36.708 --> 2:12:37.708
Oh God.

2:12:38.916 --> 2:12:41.708
[breathing heavily]

2:12:56.041 --> 2:12:57.208
This way, Miss Monroe.

2:13:01.708 --> 2:13:02.833
Right here.

2:13:06.500 --> 2:13:09.000

[man 2] Ma'am.

2:13:17.208 --> 2:13:18.791
This way, Miss Monroe.

2:13:26.541 --> 2:13:28.125
We have Miss Monroe here, sir.

2:13:47.166 --> 2:13:48.125
The matter being?

2:13:50.333 --> 2:13:53.166
-[man speaks indistinctly over telephone]
-I see.

2:13:57.083 --> 2:14:00.416
[man speaking indistinctly over telephone]

2:14:01.041 --> 2:14:03.666
And just who might this man be?

2:14:05.250 --> 2:14:07.791
[man speaking indistinctly over telephone]

2:14:07.875 --> 2:14:11.791
Am I glad to see you, baby.
This has been one hell of a day.

2:14:12.666 --> 2:14:14.541
Oh, gosh, I've been told, darling.

2:14:14.625 --> 2:14:16.625
[man speaks indistinctly over telephone]

2:14:17.250 --> 2:14:18.708
[Norma Jeane] How can I help?

2:14:21.833 --> 2:14:25.791
[man speaking indistinctly over telephone]

2:14:34.541 --> 2:14:37.458
If you've got pictures, you'll see
she can hardly be called "common."

2:14:38.250 --> 2:14:43.583
[man speaking indistinctly over telephone]

2:14:43.666 --> 2:14:45.250
Nor will you lecture me, sir.

2:14:45.916 --> 2:14:47.916
Baby. Don't be shy. Come on, come on.

2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.291
[rustling rhythmically]

2:14:52.916 --> 2:14:54.833
-[man] Mr. President.
-[Norma Jeane moans]

2:14:57.833 --> 2:15:00.625
-[man] Mr. President.
-[whispers] Don't be shy. Come on.

2:15:03.666 --> 2:15:07.708
[man] Mr. President, a gubernatorial aide
in Texas alleges you molested her.

2:15:07.791 --> 2:15:11.000
The Bureau has also uncovered
a member of White House personnel

2:15:11.083 --> 2:15:14.958
willing to testify that you and she
conducted an inappropriate sexual liaison.

2:15:15.041 --> 2:15:16.708
[rustling rhythmically]

2:15:16.791 --> 2:15:20.916
These women, these allegations,
they not only inflict irreparable harm…

2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.791
-Baby, come on.
-…on the presidency, but also on America.

2:15:23.875 --> 2:15:27.416
My personal life
is no one's business but my own.

2:15:28.166 --> 2:15:31.791
[president breathes heavily, sighs]

2:15:41.416 --> 2:15:43.083
[Norma Jeane] Who brought me here

2:15:43.583 --> 2:15:44.708
to this place?

2:15:47.291 --> 2:15:48.500
Was it Marilyn?

2:15:49.416 --> 2:15:51.791
But why does Marilyn do these things?

2:15:52.291 --> 2:15:53.875
What does Marilyn want?

2:15:55.041 --> 2:15:57.916
-[president moans]
-[Norma Jeane] Or is it a movie scene?

2:15:58.416 --> 2:16:01.416
I'm playing the part
of a famous blonde actress

2:16:01.500 --> 2:16:05.416
meeting the boyishly handsome leader
of the free world,

2:16:05.500 --> 2:16:10.000
the President of the United States,
for a romantic rendezvous.

2:16:11.458 --> 2:16:16.041
The girl upstairs
in harmless soft porn film.

2:16:16.125 --> 2:16:21.083
Just once. Why not?
Any scene can be played.

2:16:21.166 --> 2:16:23.750
Whether well or badly, it can be played.

2:16:23.833 --> 2:16:25.791
[president grunting]

2:16:25.875 --> 2:16:28.250
[Norma Jeane] And it won't last
more than a few minutes.

2:16:28.333 --> 2:16:33.458
[president] Dirty slut.
Oh! Oh, you dirty slut. [exhales deeply]

2:16:33.541 --> 2:16:35.500
-[Norma Jeane] Just don't puke.
-[president moans]

2:16:35.583 --> 2:16:38.833
-[Norma Jeane] Not here. Not in this bed.
-[president grunting]

2:16:38.916 --> 2:16:41.833
-[Norma Jeane] Don't cough. Don't gag.
-[president grunting forcefully]

2:16:41.916 --> 2:16:43.833
[Norma Jeane] You have to swallow.

2:16:43.916 --> 2:16:47.416
-You have to swallow.
-Oh, you dirty girl… [gasps]

2:16:48.166 --> 2:16:50.083
Oh, baby! [moans]

2:16:51.750 --> 2:16:54.583

Mr. President… Mr. President…

2:17:39.833 --> 2:17:41.708
These women, Mr. President…

2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:44.958
These allegations,

2:17:46.666 --> 2:17:49.375
they inflict irreparable harm on America.

2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:53.708
Mr. President.

2:17:55.208 --> 2:17:56.250
Uh…

2:17:56.333 --> 2:17:57.166
[exhales]

2:17:59.500 --> 2:18:02.583
Gee, Pronto, these girls?

2:18:02.666 --> 2:18:03.750
[sighs]

2:18:03.833 --> 2:18:06.291
Gosh, I know you're a man of the world.

2:18:06.791 --> 2:18:08.416
I'm not a child. [chuckles]

2:18:09.208 --> 2:18:11.000
You don't have to worry about me.

-[agent 2] Oh, Jesus. Grab her.
-[agent 1] I got her. Come on.

2:18:29.625 --> 2:18:33.375
Miss Monroe, this way, ma'am.
Do you need assistance?

2:18:42.416 --> 2:18:44.083
I love the president.

2:18:47.625 --> 2:18:49.083
I love the president.

No. I'm fine.

Miss Monroe! What's wrong? What's wrong?

2:19:45.541 --> 2:19:48.208
Oh, gosh, Whitey. I thought I was dead.

2:19:48.291 --> 2:19:50.250
-You just dozed off.
-Just for a second.

2:19:52.208 --> 2:19:54.208
[both laughing]

2:19:54.291 --> 2:19:55.791
Oh God.

2:19:55.875 --> 2:19:57.083
Oh, stop.

2:20:01.791 --> 2:20:04.083
And you thought you were… You look dead.

2:20:04.875 --> 2:20:08.166
-I need this.
-My God. Have it.

2:20:08.250 --> 2:20:10.541
[Norma Jeane laughing]

2:20:11.791 --> 2:20:12.750
You all right?

2:20:13.375 --> 2:20:14.583
Stop screaming.

2:20:17.083 --> 2:20:17.916
[exhales]

2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:20.458
[both laughing]

2:20:36.708 --> 2:20:39.375
[ethereal music playing]

2:20:47.833 --> 2:20:49.875
[telephone ringing]

2:21:12.083 --> 2:21:14.583
[ringing continues]

2:21:25.833 --> 2:21:27.083
[Norma Jeane] Who is it?

2:21:28.250 --> 2:21:30.625
[static crackles, whistles]

2:21:31.791 --> 2:21:33.375
[telephone slams onto receiver]

2:21:45.208 --> 2:21:48.833
[ominous music playing]

2:22:06.625 --> 2:22:07.708
[gasps]

2:22:11.500 --> 2:22:14.708

2:22:28.083 --> 2:22:29.333
[dog barking]

2:22:48.416 --> 2:22:49.833
[ominous music intensifies]

2:22:53.416 --> 2:22:54.833
[thudding]

2:22:54.916 --> 2:22:56.708
[breathing heavily]

2:23:02.500 --> 2:23:03.541
[thudding continues]

2:23:06.500 --> 2:23:08.833
The circle of light is yours.

2:23:08.916 --> 2:23:13.041
You enclose yourself in the circle.
You carry it with you wherever you go.

2:23:13.125 --> 2:23:15.375
[thudding continues]

2:23:16.500 --> 2:23:18.791
The circle of light is yours.

2:23:18.875 --> 2:23:22.916
You enclose yourself in the circle.
You carry it with you wherever you go.

2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:25.250
-[footsteps approaching]
-[whimpering]

2:23:25.333 --> 2:23:26.583
[screams]

2:23:27.083 --> 2:23:29.833
[somber music playing]

2:23:50.416 --> 2:23:54.000
It's just a dream. It's just a dream.

2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.166
[sobs] It's just a dream.

2:24:02.250 --> 2:24:04.125
It's just a dream.

2:24:05.625 --> 2:24:07.625
[instruments clinking]

2:24:08.333 --> 2:24:10.958
It's just a dream. It's just a… [crying]

2:24:13.708 --> 2:24:15.375
[menacing music playing]

2:24:24.791 --> 2:24:26.375
[Norma Jeane laughs maniacally]

2:24:30.500 --> 2:24:32.541
It's just a crazy dream.

2:24:37.083 --> 2:24:41.041
[suctioning]

2:25:06.750 --> 2:25:07.708
[groans]

2:25:12.666 --> 2:25:13.708
[sighs]

2:25:18.375 --> 2:25:19.875
Oh Christ.

2:25:21.291 --> 2:25:23.083
What an ugly dream.

2:25:26.750 --> 2:25:27.958
[telephone ringing]

2:25:35.291 --> 2:25:36.958
What a crazy dream.

2:25:44.416 --> 2:25:46.541
[father] I have not intended to be cruel.

2:25:47.375 --> 2:25:48.875
Or to toy with your heart.

2:25:52.208 --> 2:25:54.666
I have been incapacitated by illness.

2:25:56.750 --> 2:25:58.583
But you are in my thoughts often.

2:26:03.916 --> 2:26:06.208
I have known you only at a distance.

2:26:07.291 --> 2:26:11.583
Years passed, and that distance
seemed too great to surmount.

2:26:15.916 --> 2:26:18.875
Time is like a fast river
running through us.

2:26:20.625 --> 2:26:22.041
Already it isn't.

2:26:24.208 --> 2:26:27.458
Soon I will contact you, I promise.

2:26:27.541 --> 2:26:31.125
Yes. Yes, but why are you waiting?

2:26:32.666 --> 2:26:34.208
[father] Your tearful father.

2:26:35.125 --> 2:26:36.541
[telephone ringing]

2:26:45.083 --> 2:26:47.333
-[line picks up]
-[Eddy over telephone] Norma…

2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:49.583
[breathing shakily]

2:26:49.666 --> 2:26:50.625
It's Eddy G.

2:26:51.958 --> 2:26:53.208
[tearfully] Cass is dead.

2:26:58.833 --> 2:27:03.541
Choked on his puke and strangled.
Classic alky death, huh?

2:27:04.458 --> 2:27:06.875
I found him when I came over this morning.

2:27:11.250 --> 2:27:13.250
Cass left a memento for you, Norma.

2:27:14.208 --> 2:27:15.250
[sobs]

2:27:16.708 --> 2:27:18.333
[Eddy] Most of his things, he left to me.

2:27:18.416 --> 2:27:22.291
I was his good buddy, never let him down,
so he left most of his things to me.

2:27:23.291 --> 2:27:24.750
But this memento…

2:27:25.416 --> 2:27:26.500
[breathing heavily]

2:27:26.583 --> 2:27:28.875
[Eddy] …"This is for Norma someday,"
he'd say.

2:27:31.750 --> 2:27:33.250
It meant a lot to him.

2:27:34.916 --> 2:27:37.791
"Norma always had my heart," he'd say.

2:27:37.875 --> 2:27:38.958
[breathes heavily]

2:27:42.500 --> 2:27:43.375
No.

2:27:46.083 --> 2:27:47.208
[Eddy] "No" what?

2:27:50.291 --> 2:27:51.250
[crying]

2:27:52.333 --> 2:27:53.625
I don't want it.

2:27:54.666 --> 2:27:56.333
I don't want it, Eddy.

2:27:56.416 --> 2:27:58.833
[Eddy] How do you know
you don't want it, Norma?

2:28:01.208 --> 2:28:02.541
You don't know what it is.

2:28:06.541 --> 2:28:09.916
Right, baby. I'll send it.

2:28:11.333 --> 2:28:12.833
Look for special delivery.

2:28:26.083 --> 2:28:27.166
[Norma Jeane grunts]

2:28:29.333 --> 2:28:30.333
Thank you.

2:28:31.666 --> 2:28:33.250
Oh, just a minute.

2:28:42.041 --> 2:28:43.416
Where's my wallet?

2:28:44.958 --> 2:28:46.125
Not in my purse?

2:29:00.166 --> 2:29:01.500
Where did I put it?

2:29:06.291 --> 2:29:08.625
[pensive music playing]

2:30:23.500 --> 2:30:24.500
Oh.

2:31:26.541 --> 2:31:27.791
[breath trembling]

2:31:39.083 --> 2:31:40.041
[gasps]

2:31:54.500 --> 2:31:55.833
[sobs]

2:31:55.916 --> 2:31:58.291
But you wanted baby dead too.

2:32:02.833 --> 2:32:04.416
You know you did.

2:32:08.500 --> 2:32:09.458
[cries]

2:32:24.041 --> 2:32:25.041
[sniffles]

[gasping]

2:33:17.416 --> 2:33:18.333
[sobbing]

2:33:34.041 --> 2:33:35.583
[screams]

2:33:37.833 --> 2:33:39.416
[continues sobbing]

2:33:45.875 --> 2:33:47.583
[screams]

2:34:15.416 --> 2:34:17.541
[melancholy music playing]

2:37:09.625 --> 2:37:11.583
[mother] Norma Jeane, look.

2:37:14.958 --> 2:37:16.375
That man is your father.

2:37:55.500 --> 2:37:58.625
[birds chirping softly]

2:38:06.083 --> 2:38:09.000
[children chattering in distance]

2:38:32.291 --> 2:38:35.291
[chirping, chattering fade to silence]
