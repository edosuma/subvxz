DARLENE DOESN'T TRUST ME
TO CHECK HER HOMEWORK.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.178
DARLENE
DID HER HOMEWORK?

11:18.211 --> 11:19.446
WE SAT DOWN
AT THE TABLE,

11:19.479 --> 11:20.480
AND SHE DID HER WORK.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.349
SHE'S A GREAT KID.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.216
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.184
I GOT TO GO.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.019
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
BREAKFAST.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.454
I'LL EAT IT
IN THE TRUCK.

11:27.487 --> 11:35.028
WELL, WAIT, NOW,
WAIT, WAIT A SECOND.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.998
THERE.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.632
THANKS.
SEE YOU LATER, HONEY.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.568
OK, DEAR.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.236
BUT YOU CALL IF YOU'LL
BE REAL LATE.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.806
WILL DO.

11:45.839 --> 11:50.343
DARLENE, BECKY, D.J.,
BREAKFAST IS READY!

11:50.377 --> 11:54.581
I MADE FRENCH TOAST!

11:55.415 --> 11:57.117
JACK!

11:57.150 --> 11:59.052
WHAT'S THE HAPS, JACK?

11:59.086 --> 12:03.490
OOH, LA, LA,
THE TOAST FRANCHAISE.

12:03.523 --> 12:06.459
GOOD MORNING, YOU TWO.

12:06.493 --> 12:07.928
DARLENE,
YOU'RE WEARING MAKEUP?

12:07.961 --> 12:08.896
NO.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.764
YOUR CHEEKS
ARE SO ROSY.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.465
THE HEAT
WASN'T WORKING
LAST NIGHT.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.502
I TURNED IT OFF.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.438
NOT GOOD TO SLEEP
WHEN IT'S TOO WARM.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.372
DID YOU SLEEP OK?

12:19.406 --> 12:23.510
YEAH, I DID.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.378
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS OUTFIT?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.948
I LIKE IT.
KIND OF SEXY.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.649
MOM DOESN'T LIKE IT.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.651
WELL, MOM'S NOT HERE.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.487
WELL, ALL RIGHT, JACK!

12:34.521 --> 12:40.227
HOW LONG YOU THINK
THE BIG R
WILL STAY SOUTH?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.530
I THINK SHE'LL BE GONE
A COUPLE MORE DAYS.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.397
YES!

12:44.431 --> 12:46.133
AWESOME.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.268
MAYBE SATURDAY
WE CAN DO
A MALL MARATHON.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.938
ALL RIGHT.
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.572
CAN JODI COME?

12:52.605 --> 12:55.909
I THINK
JODI'S A DIP.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.677
WE CAN JUST GO,
US THREE.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.012
WE'LL MAKE BETTER TIME
THAT WAY.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.048
YEAH.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.951
SPEAKING OF TIME,
GET YOUR BROTHER.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.218
SHE'S EATING.
I'LL GET HIM.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.687
OK.

13:07.720 --> 13:12.025
THANKS, DAR.

13:12.059 --> 13:15.728
J-BIRD, YOU'RE
AN EXPERIENCED
WOMAN, RIGHT?

13:15.762 --> 13:17.797
WELL, I'M NOT
ALL THAT EXPERIENCED.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.833
YOU'VE DATED
A LOT OF BOYS.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.235
YES, AND
A COUPLE OF MEN.

13:22.269 --> 13:25.072
WELL, AT LEAST ONE.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.374
OK, THIS GUY ROY
IN MY ENGLISH CLASS?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.442
HE'S A MAJOR BABE.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.745
HE DOESN'T KNOW
I LIKE HIM.

13:32.779 --> 13:33.780
I DON'T WANT TO DO
ANYTHING WEAK--

13:33.813 --> 13:36.783
WRITE A NOTE
OR HAVE SOMEONE
TELL HIM.

13:36.816 --> 13:41.421
WELL, WHAT ALWAYS
WORKED FOR ME
WAS A LOOK.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.329
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT A LOOK

13:49.362 --> 13:52.232
IS YOU CAN NEVER
SAY THE WRONG THING.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.034
BRILLIANT!

13:54.067 --> 13:55.135
I GOT D.J.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.669
I WANT TO WATCH TV!

13:56.703 --> 13:59.339
OH, NO, D.J.
NOT NOW.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.673
WE'RE RUNNING
KIND OF LATE.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.842
COME ON.

14:02.876 --> 14:03.977
WILL YOU BE HERE
TONIGHT?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.645
ABSOLUTELY.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.981
MAYBE WE CAN PLAY
DIRTY SCRABBLE.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.516
COUNT ON IT.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.585
OK, EVERYBODY!
TIME FOR SCHOOL! HERE WE GO.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.623
FRONT AND CENTER,
CHOP-CHOP!

14:42.950 --> 14:44.617
I'VE BEEN ON THIS
JOB FOR SIX DAYS,

14:44.651 --> 14:48.221
AND ALREADY THE
COMPANY'S OFFERED
FUTURE WORK.

14:48.255 --> 14:52.759
WHEN IT RAINS,
IT POURS.

14:52.792 --> 14:56.096
I'M EVEN THINKING
OF GETTING ANOTHER TRUCK.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.131
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.399
I'M PROUD OF ME, TOO.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.034
YOU SHOULD BE, DAN.

15:01.068 --> 15:05.038
YOU'VE MADE THIS COMPANY
REALLY A SUCCESS.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.774
THAT'S ME--
A SUCCESS.

15:07.807 --> 15:08.908
WANT TO HAND ME
THE DISHRAG?

15:08.942 --> 15:12.512
NO, I'LL DRY.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.484
I'VE NEVER WASHED DISHES
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN BEFORE.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.918
REALLY?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.453
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

15:20.487 --> 15:24.124
CHEAP.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.327
SO THIS IS WHAT
MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.728
YOU COME HOME FROM WORK.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.331
HAVE DINNER
WITH YOUR SPOUSE.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.799
WASH THE DISHES
TOGETHER.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.234
SHOOT THE BREEZE.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.370
GO TO SLEEP.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.007
YOU'RE GLAMORIZING IT.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.044
IT MUST BE COMFORTING
TO HAVE SOMEBODY
TO TALK TO,

15:44.077 --> 15:46.779
OR HAVE SOMEBODY
BE THERE WHEN
YOU COME HOME.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.015
IT IS.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.183
NOT THAT I'VE
EVER HAD ANYBODY.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.119
WHAT ABOUT
THAT COP--BOB?

15:52.152 --> 15:54.021
BOB? YOU MEAN DAVE?

15:54.054 --> 15:57.424
DAVE'S GONE. THERE'S
ANOTHER COP. PAUL.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.591
PACE YOURSELF, JACKIE,

15:58.625 --> 16:01.228
OR YOU'LL RUN
OUT OF COPS.

16:01.261 --> 16:05.232
YOU'LL HAVE TO DIP
INTO THE FIREMEN'S POOL.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.167
I'VE DATED FIREMEN.
THEY'RE OK.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.271
THEY'RE USUALLY
ALWAYS ON TIME.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.405
TELL ME
ABOUT THIS PAUL.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.806
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

16:13.840 --> 16:16.776
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.579
HE COMES OVER,
TELLS ME HE'LL CALL,

16:19.612 --> 16:20.680
THEN HE NEVER CALLS.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.482
AND WHEN HE DOES CALL,

16:22.515 --> 16:24.084
I HAVE TO PRETEND
I'M BUSY,

16:24.117 --> 16:27.754
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE HIM
THINKING I'M AVAILABLE.

16:27.787 --> 16:31.958
I SPEND LOTS
OF TIME LOOKING
LIKE I'M BUSY.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.261
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
A GOOD COP.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.763
BUT I AM
A GOOD COP.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.431
I JUST SAID SO.

16:38.465 --> 16:41.634
BUT YOU WERE KIDDING.

16:41.668 --> 16:45.038
I HAVE TO WATCH MYSELF
BEFORE COMPLIMENTING YOU.

16:45.072 --> 16:46.639
YOU'RE NOT USED
TO HEARING THAT.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.275
NEXT TIME
YOU COMPLIMENT ME,

16:48.308 --> 16:50.943
WARN ME FIRST.

16:50.977 --> 16:55.082
ANYWAY, THAT'S THE
STORY ABOUT PAUL.

16:55.115 --> 16:59.152
YOU GOT TO BE
MORE FORCEFUL.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.187
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
TREATED LIKE THAT.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.254
THAT'S THE WAY
GUYS ARE.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.789
NOT ALL OF THEM.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.158
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.527
I SHOULD FIND
A PERFECT GUY LIKE YOU.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.861
YEAH, PERFECT.

17:08.895 --> 17:13.133
JUST A GOOD JOB,
CHARMING, DECENT...

17:13.166 --> 17:14.567
THREE KIDS
AND A WIFE.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.236
THAT'S NEVER
STOPPED YOU BEFORE.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.206
SORRY. CHEAP SHOT.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.174
I SHOULD HAVE
GRABBED YOU FIRST.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.442
NO CHANCE.

17:22.475 --> 17:26.613
WHAT, ME DATE
A FRESHMAN?

17:26.646 --> 17:28.581
ARE YOU KIDDING?

17:28.615 --> 17:29.549
NO WAY.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.983
I BET YOU
DON'T REMEMBER...

17:31.017 --> 17:36.423
THE FIRST TIME
WE MET.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.659
I DO.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.393
SO DO I.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.461
NO, YOU DON'T.

17:41.494 --> 17:44.964
BUT I WAS KIND
ENOUGH TO LET
MY SISTER HAVE YOU.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.100
I STEPPED ASIDE

17:47.134 --> 17:54.006
AND HELD BACK
ALL MY BUDDING
TEENAGE PASSIONS.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.710
I'D BETTER LET THIS
SOAK TILL TOMORROW.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.711
I'LL GET
THAT TOMORROW.

17:58.745 --> 17:59.846
WHAT TIME
ARE YOU LEAVING?

17:59.879 --> 18:02.682
EARLY. TOMORROW'S
GOING TO BE A BEAR.

18:02.715 --> 18:06.453
YOU ARE SO FUNNY.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.920
WHAT?

18:07.954 --> 18:09.522
I EMBARRASSED YOU.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.624
YOU DIDN'T EMBARRASS ME.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.860
YOU DIDN'T EMBARRASS ME.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.763
I HAD
A CRUSH ON YOU.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.165
YOU DID?

18:18.198 --> 18:22.435
YEAH, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE PRETTY CUTE.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.436
MORE BEER?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.972
NOW I AM
EMBARRASSING YOU.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.675
NO, YOU'RE NOT
EMBARRASSING ME.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.243
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE CUTE, TOO.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.544
YOU HATED ME.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.614
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE CUTE.

18:34.647 --> 18:35.848
REALLY?

18:35.882 --> 18:38.918
YEAH...

18:38.951 --> 18:42.222
YOU JUST GOT
ON MY NERVES,
THAT'S ALL.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.823
I STILL GET
ON YOUR NERVES.

18:43.856 --> 18:52.599
YEAH.

18:52.632 --> 18:57.270
SO TELL ME MORE
ABOUT PAUL.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.507
OH...WELL,
HE'S BASICALLY
A NICE GUY.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.610
BUT HE'S A...

19:03.643 --> 19:05.312
LIAR.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.180
BUT NOT LIKE
A VICIOUS LIAR.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.583
HE TELLS ME HE'S
GOT AN '87 CAR,

19:10.617 --> 19:12.785
AND IT'S
REALLY AN '85.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.322
LITTLE THINGS
LIKE THAT.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.390
YOU KILL ME, JACKIE.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.727
YOU DESERVE BETTER
THAN THOSE GUYS.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.262
I MEAN, YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'RE FUN,

19:22.295 --> 19:26.799
YOU'RE NICE LOOKING.

19:26.833 --> 19:31.971
YOU MEAN THAT
IN A GOOD WAY?

19:32.004 --> 19:32.839
YEAH.

19:32.872 --> 19:38.378
YES, I DO.

19:42.449 --> 19:46.553
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

19:46.586 --> 19:47.787
AW...

19:47.820 --> 19:49.055

19:49.088 --> 19:50.156

19:52.759 --> 19:56.563

19:56.596 --> 20:00.099
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
BE THERE MUCH LONGER.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.401
I'M GOING
TO TAKE OFF. BYE.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.769
HANG ON, ROSEANNE.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.304
JACKIE, YOU LEAVING?

20:04.337 --> 20:08.040
TELL HER HI,
AND I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.142
HEY, JACKIE.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.713
WE JUST LOST
THE POLY HIGH GAME 27-14.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.849
YOU WERE STANDING ON THE
NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE FIELD

20:16.883 --> 20:18.385
WITH THAT
RED-HEADED GIRL.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.253
SHE WORE AN ORANGE SWEATER,

20:20.287 --> 20:25.792
AND YOU HAD ON A GRAY
HOODED SWEAT SHIRT.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.869
JACKIE...

20:36.903 --> 20:38.438
DRIVE CAREFUL.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.573
THANK YOU.

20:42.375 --> 20:47.880
HI, BABY.

20:47.914 --> 20:48.315
I MISS YOU.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.189
IT'S MOM!

20:57.223 --> 20:59.959
HEY, DAD, MOM'S HOME!

20:59.992 --> 21:02.929
I THINK YOUR HAIR
IS SO CUTE.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.498
WHEN DID YOU DO THAT?

21:05.532 --> 21:08.301
IN THE HOSPITAL,
MOM WAS DRIVING
DAD NUTS.

21:08.335 --> 21:11.137
SO I TOOK HER
TO THE BEAUTY SHOP.

21:11.170 --> 21:13.239
THEY GOT ME, TOO.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.541
SCARLET, YOU'RE BACK.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.477
DOROTHY HAMILL STYLE.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.712
I CLEANED MY CLOSET.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.114
YOU ACTUALLY
FOUND YOUR CLOSET?

21:22.148 --> 21:24.951
WE'RE CLOSE TO WINNING
THE DIVISION CHAMPIONSHIP.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.053
MOM, MOM, MOM!

21:27.086 --> 21:27.954
WHAT?

21:27.987 --> 21:29.221
DID YOU MISS ME?

21:29.255 --> 21:31.558

21:31.591 --> 21:32.158
DID YOU MISS ME?

21:32.191 --> 21:32.925
YEAH.

21:32.959 --> 21:33.560

21:33.593 --> 21:39.766

21:41.601 --> 21:44.604
WELL,
