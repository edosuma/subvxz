01:40.400 --> 01:42.493
Still with us, Jackson?

01:43.670 --> 01:47.106
What is it about solitary that
keeps you coming back for more?

01:47.807 --> 01:51.504
Your face, Carter. I've
always liked horror movies.

02:09.762 --> 02:13.254
Attention.
All prisoners in Section D.

02:13.766 --> 02:16.667
You have 45 minutes on
the exercise yard.

02:45.465 --> 02:46.796
Hi, honey.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.903
No, nothing's wrong. Matter of fact,
guess what happened to me this morning?

02:52.605 --> 02:56.200
Well, you know how I always stop off
for coffee and doughnuts on my way in.

02:56.276 --> 02:59.939
Well, just as I'm getting back in
my car, this woman walks over and...

03:02.315 --> 03:05.614
Just some woman, I don't
remember what she looked like.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.017
Anyway, she gives me
this radio.

03:08.087 --> 03:09.918
Yeah, just like that.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.987
Said it was a prize.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.993
I'd just bought
their one millionth doughnut.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.887
Chocolate glaze, my usual.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.531
What difference does it make
what kind of doughnut it was?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.129
I was not flirting with her.

03:25.738 --> 03:27.672
I never saw her before.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.242
No, I won't stop off
for a beer.

03:34.113 --> 03:35.740
I love you, too.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.793
Get in. I said get in.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.851
Welcome, my friend. We'll
meet in person soon enough.

05:55.321 --> 05:59.621
Now, sit back, relax.
Leave the driving to us.

06:17.777 --> 06:21.577
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

06:21.647 --> 06:23.672
who does not exist.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.457
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

06:33.526 --> 06:36.086
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

06:36.162 --> 06:38.289
the helpless, the powerless...

06:38.364 --> 06:41.595
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

08:55.134 --> 08:56.761
Just think of it, pal.

08:56.836 --> 09:00.499
An hour from now I'll be sailing
under the Golden Gate Bridge...

09:00.573 --> 09:03.406
challenging the winds,
riding the high seas.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.636
If memory serves me right,
Captain Bligh...

09:05.711 --> 09:07.008
and I'm sure it does...

09:07.079 --> 09:09.946
the last time you went sailing,
your boat sprung a leak...

09:10.016 --> 09:13.816
and the Coast Guard had to tow
you in, in case you don't remember.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.686
I remember. But it didn't spring
a leak, it was taking on water.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.851
And it wasn't my fault the
bilge pump broke down anyway.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.792
Blame whomever you like,
Michael...

09:22.862 --> 09:26.764
but the fact remains you came
back one hour later, soaking wet.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.595
You know, I'm sure glad you weren't
around when Columbus sailed for America.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.230
Devon's calling.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.133
Good morning, Michael.
Morning, Devon.

09:36.208 --> 09:37.368
From your position...

09:37.443 --> 09:40.469
you're about 10 minutes away
from the Santa Clara Penitentiary.

09:40.546 --> 09:44.243
No, wrong. I'm only two minutes
away from renting a sailboat.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.309
An adventure I've been looking
forward to for about two months now.

09:47.386 --> 09:48.614
Michael.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.545
All right, what's up?

09:50.623 --> 09:54.923
This is top priority. A prisoner
named CJ Jackson has just escaped.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.320
I want you to help the police
in any way possible.

09:58.397 --> 10:03.266
Devon, you look very concerned.
Who is this guy Jackson anyway?

10:03.336 --> 10:05.930
This is not just another
escaped prisoner, Michael.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.303
This touches the very heart
and soul of the Foundation.

10:08.374 --> 10:09.466
What's that mean?

10:09.542 --> 10:12.204
Look, Michael, please,
trust me on this, will you?

10:13.412 --> 10:14.936
Okay, we're on.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.512
All right, KITT, patch us into
the police frequency...

10:17.583 --> 10:20.245
and let's see if we can get
a fix on the getaway car.

10:32.431 --> 10:33.955
Feeling better?

10:34.767 --> 10:36.530
I'll feel better
when I'm safe.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.366
When I'm safe and I know
who you are and what you want.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.803
In due time, my friend,
in due time.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.842
I don't have no friends.
I do business.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.969
You want to do business with me,
don't call me friend or brother.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.108
As you wish, CJ.

10:50.416 --> 10:54.011
This one looks like it could be
trouble. That's part of the fun.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.955
Hi, sugar. I think you're
going my way.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.432
Now for phase two.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.891
Michael, I've been monitoring
the police band...

11:32.958 --> 11:34.823
and the suspect vehicle
has been spotted...

11:34.894 --> 11:37.522
heading north towards
the Haight-Ashbury district.

11:37.763 --> 11:38.957
Good work, buddy.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.728
All right, KITT, see if we can pick
them up on your infrared tracking scope.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.767
Good work, pal.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.434
As the saying goes, let's
head them off at the pass.

11:50.509 --> 11:53.103
Your Passive Laser Restraint
System on, Michael?

11:53.179 --> 11:54.737
I wouldn't drive without it.

12:03.122 --> 12:06.285
Michael, there he is.
I got you, pal.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.803
Michael, why aren't we
overtaking him?

12:29.915 --> 12:33.749
It's too risky in here, KITT. I don't
want him getting desperate, not yet.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.420
We'll pick the place.

13:44.924 --> 13:48.325
Young man, are you sure this is
the right way to Fisherman's Wharf?

13:48.394 --> 13:50.362
According to my map,
it's that way.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.488
Relax, Henrietta, relax.

13:52.565 --> 13:56.057
I'm sure he's just trying to save
us money and taking a shortcut.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.504
Now just sit back
and enjoy the sights.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.669
All right, KITT,
time to move in.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.613
For goodness sake's,
Henrietta, don't let go of me.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.826
Be careful, Michael.
I hear you.

14:30.836 --> 14:34.272
You have any idea who he is?
No such luck.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.368
KITT, there's no one
inside here.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.775
Michael, that's impossible.
A car doesn't drive by itself.

14:39.845 --> 14:41.244
Doesn't it?

14:43.549 --> 14:44.777
Tell me about it.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.717
You say your radio turned into
a robot?

14:56.161 --> 14:58.595
I know it sounds crazy,
but that's what happened.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.633
And then this little robot
shot out a puff of smoke...

15:01.700 --> 15:04.066
and you passed out
before you reached the alarm.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.433
Dead to the world.

15:05.504 --> 15:09.372
And when you came to,
this was all that was left?

15:10.976 --> 15:12.034
Yeah.

15:12.111 --> 15:15.444
Look, if you don't mind, I don't
want that thing anywhere near me.

15:15.514 --> 15:18.972
You know, the description of the woman
who gave this to you was pretty vague.

15:19.051 --> 15:22.248
Hey, what can I say? I was
more interested in a free radio.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.786
Check with the doughnut shop,
they've got to know her.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.882
The police already have.
What did they say?

15:26.959 --> 15:30.520
They said they don't give away
prizes and they don't count doughnuts.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.032
My wife's never gonna
believe this.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.297
She'll have a lot of company.

16:07.733 --> 16:11.635
Welcome, Mr. Jackson. I hope your
trip here wasn't too uncomfortable.

16:11.904 --> 16:14.304
Well, I have been on
worse trips in my life.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.431
Yes, I'm sure you have.

16:17.876 --> 16:21.039
My name is Margo.
This is David Halston...

16:21.747 --> 16:23.806
the genius who engineered
your escape.

16:25.184 --> 16:27.675
Those two over there
are Clifton and Turk.

16:28.287 --> 16:31.313
But don't worry, I don't let
them in my house unless it rains.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.418
Babette, why don't you get Mr.
Jackson a glass of champagne.

16:35.761 --> 16:39.754
You do like champagne, don't you, CJ?
I used to drink it all the time in my cell.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.229
Those days are over, CJ.

16:42.868 --> 16:46.395
We've given you your freedom and soon
we're going to give you even more.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.104
There is no more.

16:48.173 --> 16:52.303
Sure there is. There's the money it
takes for a man like you to stay free.

16:53.345 --> 16:57.782
CJ, we're going to guarantee your
freedom by making you very rich.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.050
And what do I have to
do for it?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.210
Do for it?
You heard me.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.016
I spent half of my life
behind bars.

17:05.089 --> 17:08.457
There's one thing I learned, that
nobody gives anything for nothing.

17:09.161 --> 17:12.061
You're right, CJ,
I do want something from you.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.325
But I don't intend to tell you
what it is until I'm ready.

17:16.335 --> 17:20.431
You can leave and try
making it on your own...

17:21.607 --> 17:25.338
or you can stay and
definitely make it with us.

17:32.785 --> 17:33.911
Good.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.884
Well, now that that's
taken care of.

17:41.994 --> 17:45.760
To the beginning of a beautiful
and prosperous relationship.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.410
Thank you.

18:01.613 --> 18:04.582
Michael, you don't believe this
nonsense about a robot, do you?

18:04.650 --> 18:08.586
Devon, after seeing the way that car
handled by itself, I'm afraid I do.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.352
Any ideas?
Only one.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.323
What's it?
Too bad Bonnie's not around.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.825
Didn't I tell you?
What?

18:14.893 --> 18:17.726
She is. She's taking advanced
studies at the university here.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.058
No kidding.
Did you talk to her?

18:19.131 --> 18:20.428
Yes.

18:20.499 --> 18:25.027
And if you're wondering why I haven't asked
her to return to the Foundation, I have.

18:25.170 --> 18:28.628
Her answer was no.
A very polite but firm no.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.532
Devon, who's this
CJ Jackson and...

18:31.610 --> 18:34.135
what does he have to do with the
heart and soul of the Foundation?

18:34.213 --> 18:38.411
Michael, before Wilton Knight discovered
you, we had another man in your position.

18:38.484 --> 18:40.008
His name was Ken Franklyn.

18:40.085 --> 18:42.679
He had all the qualifications.
Well, all except one.

18:42.754 --> 18:44.312
He wasn't a police officer.

18:45.491 --> 18:48.289
One night,
several years ago...

18:48.861 --> 18:52.319
I remember it was raining, most
unusual for the time of year.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.356
Franklyn had been
tailing Jackson.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.993
He was convinced
that Jackson hadn't made him.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.997
But he was wrong.

19:00.105 --> 19:03.074
Jackson killed him?
One bullet did it.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.873
But Jackson shot him
five more times.

19:07.112 --> 19:11.242
We all took the tragic loss very hard,
but no one harder than Wilton Knight.

19:11.316 --> 19:15.013
He closed the Foundation, put
the entire FLAG project on hold...

19:15.087 --> 19:17.749
and didn't reactivate it
until we found you.

19:18.423 --> 19:20.823
Jackson belongs in jail,
Michael.

19:20.893 --> 19:24.693
Wilton Knight will not rest easily
until he is back behind bars.

19:25.197 --> 19:26.425
Nor will I.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.400
All right, Devon,
that makes three of us.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.093
This one's for Wilton, huh?

19:33.372 --> 19:35.135
Good luck, Michael.
Thanks, Devon.

20:32.664 --> 20:36.065
Are you Ho Chin? Yes.
How may I be of service?

20:36.635 --> 20:38.296
Yeah, I hear you have
some maps.

20:38.370 --> 20:41.897
Some old maps of the tunnels your
people dug under the city years ago.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.968
Yes. Are you
from the University?

20:45.477 --> 20:47.968
Yeah, associate professors.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.748
You think I could see them
just for a minute?

20:50.816 --> 20:52.443
They are not for sale.

20:52.517 --> 20:55.418
They have been in our family
many, many years.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.315
I'd like to look at them
for a minute.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.023
Come with me.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.016
Let's go.

21:49.107 --> 21:51.940
He's hitting him with a right,
a left.

21:52.244 --> 21:55.475
Another left to the
midsection, that one hurt him.

21:55.547 --> 21:57.538
There's no question
about him...

21:57.616 --> 22:00.449
Where is the Peking duck?
Say what?

22:00.519 --> 22:05.422
The Peking duck, you idiot! Oh,
that duck. It's coming right up.

22:05.490 --> 22:08.516
I thought you said you
were a chef. I am a chef.

22:08.694 --> 22:13.222
I am a great chef. I'm just a
little bit rusty, that's all.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.391
All you do is bet sports
and gamble.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.992
I'm a great chef who
bets sports and gambles.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.334
Now, watch out.
This is really hot.

22:23.575 --> 22:26.544
If you lie to me, I'll break
every bone in your body.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.636
Now, where's
the Fong Delight?

22:30.849 --> 22:33.010
Wong Delight.
Fong Delight.

22:33.318 --> 22:36.151
Anything made in this kitchen
bears my name.

22:36.254 --> 22:38.814
My name's Fong,
yours is Wong.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.584
Mine's Fong.
Now out of my way.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.564
Say what?

22:57.109 --> 22:58.770
Michael,
where are we going?

22:58.844 --> 23:00.641
To see
an old friend, pal.

23:00.846 --> 23:03.440
I thought this case was
top priority.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.746
It is. I'm hoping this
old friend can help us out.

23:06.818 --> 23:09.844
Where are we going to see
this old friend? North Beach?

23:09.921 --> 23:12.617
Bite your tongue, pal.
The University.

23:12.691 --> 23:15.251
Plot me the fastest route,
will you? Yes, Michael.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.334
You!
Me?

23:23.602 --> 23:25.627
Out!
Out? Hey.

23:26.304 --> 23:29.137
Hey, what did I do? What did
I... Hey, I'm warning you.

23:29.207 --> 23:31.107
Yeah, I'm warning you.
Don't come any closer.

23:31.176 --> 23:34.043
That's right, you see,
because I'm a black belt.

23:34.112 --> 23:38.173
That's right, a black belt. I fought
Bruce Lee to a standstill. I fought...

23:38.483 --> 23:41.247
If I see you again, I'll
slit your throat! Hey.

24:07.045 --> 24:09.070
Hello, Peter. Need a lift?

24:12.150 --> 24:13.811
Me?
You.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.412
Why?
Why not?

24:35.907 --> 24:37.431
Chinese jerk!

24:37.776 --> 24:39.573
Hey, get rid of it.

25:16.281 --> 25:19.944
Excuse me. I was wondering
if I could get a student loan.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.111
I think you're in
the wrong department.

25:23.088 --> 25:26.216
Yeah, well, I bet Devon you'd
return after a year and you didn't.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.349
Michael!

25:28.693 --> 25:32.493
Hi, Bonnie. Is it good
to see you again!

25:33.031 --> 25:35.829
Broke as usual?
Some things never change.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.529
What are you doing here?
Let me look at you.

25:38.803 --> 25:41.567
You're still tall.
And you're still beautiful.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.300
How's Devon?
British as ever.

25:44.376 --> 25:48.312
As a matter of fact, he sends his
love. Then he knows you're here.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.178
Michael, if this is something to
do with the Foundation, or a case...

25:51.249 --> 25:52.409
we've been through
all that.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.577
This is different. They're
all different, Michael. No.

25:54.653 --> 25:58.453
Bonnie, CJ Jackson escaped
from prison. He had some help.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.313
CJ Jackson?
Yeah.

26:01.660 --> 26:04.823
I leave for Boston on Thursday.
Someone went to a lot of trouble.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.797
They designed a self-destruct
robot to work it from the inside...

26:07.866 --> 26:09.629
and a drone car to work it
from the outside.

26:09.701 --> 26:12.101
MIT is presenting two research
projects for funding.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.694
Only one of them
will be approved.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.865
This is the drone car's
computer processing unit.

26:15.941 --> 26:17.966
One of them, thanks to
my mentor, is mine.

26:18.043 --> 26:21.240
Bonnie, I'm not here asking you
to sign up for a tour of duty.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.247
Just help us find CJ Jackson.

26:23.748 --> 26:27.411
No obligations, no contracts,
no promises.

26:29.387 --> 26:32.185
You're trying to tempt me.
How am I doing?

26:35.260 --> 26:37.990
No contracts, no obligations?

26:38.630 --> 26:40.029
Scout's honor.

26:41.866 --> 26:44.835
Oh, we missed you.
Boy, we missed you.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.712
This is perfect. These maps
are exactly what we need.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.949
You're sure the old man
won't tell anyone?

27:39.024 --> 27:40.753
Only his ancestor.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.325
Good boys.

27:43.528 --> 27:46.725
Now why don't you go outside
and chase some rabbits?

27:46.831 --> 27:49.766
Yeah, but... Don't worry,
Clifton, we'll play later.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.433
Don't say boo to him
or he'll run.

28:01.746 --> 28:03.976
Miss me, baby?
You know it, mama.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.810
Hello, Peter.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.048
I'm Margo, and this is
David Halston and CJ Jackson.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.221
Hey, you one of those
martial arts dudes, man?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.322
Me? No.

28:15.927 --> 28:18.794
Why? I look like one?
No.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.393
Look, what is this all about?

28:24.836 --> 28:26.133
Relax, Peter.

28:26.204 --> 28:29.173
We just want to make use
of your extraordinary talents.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.332
My talents?

28:30.408 --> 28:32.638
As one of the best wiremen
in the business.

28:33.878 --> 28:37.279
That was in my past. No, see,
I'm trying to go clean now.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.381
I'm a chef.

28:39.584 --> 28:42.747
Peter, as a chef, you couldn't
heat up a frozen egg roll.

28:43.188 --> 28:46.089
Now why don't you
just be a good little boy...

28:46.157 --> 28:48.819
and let Margo decide
what's best for you.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.137
That's a computer, not a sofa.

29:00.905 --> 29:01.894
Oh...

29:02.974 --> 29:05.033
I was wondering
why that thing was so hard.

29:06.044 --> 29:08.842
How's it coming?
Put it this way.

29:09.481 --> 29:13.383
If it was a murder mystery,
Sherlock would call it a tough case.

29:14.185 --> 29:17.313
Whoever created this little
monster sure knew what he was doing.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.650
Take a look.

29:23.361 --> 29:26.057
Don't you ever sleep?
Dr. Halston.

29:26.164 --> 29:29.463
How many times do I have to
tell you? It's David. D-A-V-I-D.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.865
David Halston.
Michael Knight.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.494
I'm sorry, I should have
introduced you.

29:33.571 --> 29:35.368
Michael's an old friend.
We used to work together.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.431
Really? What kind of work
do you do, Michael?

29:37.509 --> 29:40.603
I'm with a non-profit organization.
Don't be so mysterious.

29:40.678 --> 29:42.942
He works for the Foundation
for Law and Government.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.414
Sounds exciting.
It has its moments.

29:49.587 --> 29:52.647
Project for class?
No. I hope you don't mind.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.783
It's something
Michael wanted some help with.

29:54.859 --> 29:57.521
I see. I'll make you a deal.

29:57.829 --> 30:00.662
Since Bonnie is helping you,
you can help me.

30:00.899 --> 30:03.493
I don't think so. I'm kind
of on a tight schedule.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.900
Good, so am I.
It won't take five minutes.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.734
Go ahead, Michael. I'm going
to be here for a while, anyway.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.367
All right.

30:23.354 --> 30:25.982
There, all finished.
How do you feel?

30:27.125 --> 30:29.650
Like a guinea pig.
That's exactly what you are.

30:30.195 --> 30:33.926
I'm doing a computerized project on
pain, from inception to threshold.

30:34.699 --> 30:37.065
Don't worry. You can abort
any time you choose...

30:37.135 --> 30:39.797
by stepping on that button
there in front of your chair.

30:39.871 --> 30:42.169
If that's not enough,
I'm wired in just as you are.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.800
I will feel everything that
you feel, and believe me...

30:44.876 --> 30:46.434
I'm not a masochist.
Are you ready?

30:46.878 --> 30:49.608
Wait a minute.
What am I supposed to do?

30:50.114 --> 30:51.342
Feel the pain.

30:52.884 --> 30:55.785
Until?
Until one of us aborts.

30:57.121 --> 31:00.215
Why do I feel like
this is some sort of contest?

31:00.291 --> 31:04.193
Perhaps it's just your
competitive nature. Ready?

31:49.941 --> 31:53.240
Okay, stay right there.
I'll unstrap you.

31:56.247 --> 31:59.478
How come you're not sweating?
I never do.

32:02.987 --> 32:04.784
I didn't feel any pain.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.654
Maybe it's because you forgot
to hook up your wires.

32:07.725 --> 32:09.022
Imagine that.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.688
Still, you make
an excellent subject.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.658
Dr. Halston...

32:15.033 --> 32:18.969
you try something like that
again, it would be a big mistake.

32:30.415 --> 32:32.440
Good night.
Good night.

32:38.623 --> 32:42.684
Who is this character,
Halston, anyway? My mentor.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.490
You have no idea how much
he's helped me with my project.

32:45.563 --> 32:47.190
I think I've got something.

33:12.790 --> 33:15.258
The drone's CPU did what,
Michael?

33:15.760 --> 33:18.354
Disintegrated.
Right before our eyes.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.930
What do you make of it?
I don't know, Devon.

33:21.232 --> 33:23.598
I don't know what to make
of a lot of things.

33:24.335 --> 33:27.532
Any leads on this guy
Jackson? Nothing, I'm afraid.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.138
In prison he was a loner.

33:29.207 --> 33:32.973
No gang affiliations, no friends,
no mail in over two years.

33:33.044 --> 33:36.639
So the only thing we know for sure
about this guy is that he's a boxman.

33:36.714 --> 33:40.377
One of the best, apparently. Show him
a safe and he'll find a way into it.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.147
Okay, Devon.
You know how to find me.

33:45.289 --> 33:47.985
Michael, I may have something.
What is it?

33:48.059 --> 33:50.892
I've been monitoring the police
frequency as you requested.

33:50.962 --> 33:54.125
There was a fire yesterday at
Fong's China Trader restaurant.

33:54.198 --> 33:57.656
Arson investigators traced it to
a piece of melted-down plastic...

33:57.735 --> 34:01.967
containing traces of acid identical to
those found in the radio at the prison.

34:02.106 --> 34:03.733
All right, let's hit it.

34:21.626 --> 34:25.824
Now, come over here and get
ready for the piece de resistance.

34:36.674 --> 34:39.871
David, you're not at the
University. Get on with it.

34:45.683 --> 34:46.945
Observe.

35:00.198 --> 35:03.190
Excellent. Congratulations,
David.

35:03.968 --> 35:08.234
As you can see, we are virtually
indestructible. Untouchable.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.866
You said we'd also be rich.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.711
I did say that, didn't I?
So we shall.

35:15.680 --> 35:16.772
Turk.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.385
Margo, for God's sake.

35:29.060 --> 35:33.588
Gentleman, I present to you the
object of this very special endeavor.

35:43.407 --> 35:46.740
That's Federal Reserve.
So it is.

35:47.044 --> 35:51.504
The main vault contains between $15
and $20 million, depending on the day.

35:51.582 --> 35:54.881
Man, you're crazy. Nobody hits
the Federal Reserve, nobody.

35:55.086 --> 35:58.852
I bet you said the same thing about
breaking out of solitary until yesterday.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.720
CJ, you're the best boxman
in the business.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.123
Believe me, I know. I've
checked you out thoroughly.

36:03.194 --> 36:05.321
And, Peter, you're
the premier wireman.

36:05.396 --> 36:08.923
You can handle the most sophisticated
security systems in operation today.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.333
Yeah, but I quit.
I'm through, remember?

36:12.436 --> 36:14.802
I don't do that stuff anymore.

36:14.872 --> 36:16.601
Didn't, Peter, didn't.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.139
Until someone
offered you 25 %...

36:19.210 --> 36:22.202
of $15 to $20 million.

36:23.481 --> 36:24.709
You know what?

36:25.416 --> 36:27.748
What? You just came out of retirement.

36:28.319 --> 36:31.288
Since you put it that way,
maybe one more time.

36:32.156 --> 36:35.353
But I need my equipment,
my stuff. I built it myself.

36:35.626 --> 36:37.992
Where is it?
Well, it's in my apartment.

36:38.396 --> 36:39.863
How long will it take you
to get it?

36:40.298 --> 36:41.697
Half-hour, hour at most.

36:41.766 --> 36:44.826
No, Peter, a half-hour
at the most.

37:19.003 --> 37:22.404
There's something about
Chinatown that's so mysterious.

37:25.876 --> 37:29.004
$20,000 from
the mahjong parlor...

37:29.614 --> 37:32.879
$15,000 from the den of
rarefied pleasures...

37:34.118 --> 37:36.780
$7,500 from the ladies
who travel light.

37:36.921 --> 37:39.219
Not bad for Monday.
Mr. Fong?

37:39.857 --> 37:42.348
Excuse me. I'm sorry to
bust in on you like this.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.121
Who are you?
My name is Michael Knight.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.186
I work for the Foundation
for Law and Government.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.356
Get him!

38:32.176 --> 38:34.644
All right, what should we
see first?

38:34.712 --> 38:36.907
How about there?
Well, that looks good.

38:40.818 --> 38:43.514
KITT, I need you!
Right away, Michael.

38:44.021 --> 38:45.488
Arthur,
what was that?

38:45.556 --> 38:46.545
I don't know.

38:49.894 --> 38:51.987
There's no one
driving that car, Henrietta.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.429
Our maps.
Yeah.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.563
Michael, it's two against one.

38:57.635 --> 38:59.296
Have they
no sense of fair play?

38:59.370 --> 39:00.530
I don't think so.

39:00.604 --> 39:03.471
All right, you two overgrown
bean sprouts, take a hike.

39:03.541 --> 39:07.068
I don't think they understand
the language. Very well.

39:24.929 --> 39:27.830
Are you ready to talk?
Anything you want to know.

39:27.898 --> 39:30.867
All right. Tell me about
the fire last night.

39:31.001 --> 39:35.199
Fire? You want to know about the
fire. Why didn't you just ask?

39:35.272 --> 39:38.105
I tried, but you and the egg
roll brothers over here...

39:38.175 --> 39:40.643
obviously had something else
on your minds.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.542
Now, what about the fire?

39:42.613 --> 39:45.639
He started it. That idiot chef
and his radio.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.277
His radio?

39:47.551 --> 39:50.042
Did it look like a robot?
Yes. How did you know?

39:50.421 --> 39:53.822
We tossed it in the trash, the next
thing I know the kitchen's on fire.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.189
My kitchen's on fire,
I looked out...

39:56.260 --> 39:59.991
and I saw my idiot chef being
picked up by a Silver Phantom car.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.295
Your chef, you know his name?
His name's Peter Wong.

40:03.367 --> 40:06.825
He lives with some girl on Bay
Street, a place called the Ramparts.

40:11.108 --> 40:13.008
Say goodbye to your friends,
KITT.

40:19.383 --> 40:20.714
But why, Peter?

40:20.785 --> 40:23.583
You've managed to stay out of
trouble for over a year now.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.747
Out of trouble
and out of money.

40:25.823 --> 40:29.315
Look, Su-Lin, I want to be
able to buy you presents.

40:29.393 --> 40:32.794
Nice jewelry, clothes, all the
pretty things that you deserve.

40:32.963 --> 40:34.658
But all I want is you.

40:36.066 --> 40:38.626
Besides, you'll be rich
someday, I know it.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.604
Well, how, huh?
By stuffing fortune cookies?

40:43.274 --> 40:46.732
You are a great chef.
You created Wong's Delight.

40:46.977 --> 40:50.242
Well, I created Wong's Delight
by working for Fong...

40:50.314 --> 40:52.339
and that makes it
Fong's Delight.

40:52.416 --> 40:57.012
No, Su-Lin, the only way I'm going to be
rich, is if I just do this one last job.

40:57.788 --> 41:01.952
And if you get caught? And if they
send you back into prison again?

41:04.562 --> 41:06.291
I'm not going to get caught.

41:07.131 --> 41:11.693
And I promise you, Su-Lin,
no one will separate us again.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.369
You promise?

41:24.748 --> 41:26.409
Well, here we are.

41:28.018 --> 41:31.579
By the way, those karate twins
didn't hurt you, did they, buddy?

41:31.689 --> 41:33.020
Are you kidding me, Michael?

41:33.090 --> 41:35.650
Would I kid you?
Keep your scanner peeled.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.562
Looks like I've got everything. Peter!

41:49.240 --> 41:52.334
For one last job, I promise.

41:57.081 --> 41:58.275
I love you.

41:59.550 --> 42:02.110
I'm afraid.
Don't be.

42:02.887 --> 42:05.412
Just remember,
you haven't seen me.

42:11.161 --> 42:12.321
Who is it?

42:12.396 --> 42:15.832
My name is Michael Knight.
I'm looking for Peter Wong.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.758
He's not here.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.728
Can I talk to you for a
minute? It's very important.

42:25.342 --> 42:26.400
Yes?

42:27.811 --> 42:28.835
Do you know where he is?

42:28.913 --> 42:31.814
He hasn't been here
for two days.

42:32.349 --> 42:33.373
Are you sure of that?

42:33.450 --> 42:34.712
Yes.

42:34.818 --> 42:37.309
Yeah, KITT. What is it?
Someone left the apartment.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.720
Meet me around back.
Excuse me.

43:15.125 --> 43:16.820
You got him on your scanner,
buddy?

43:16.894 --> 43:20.261
He was picked up by that Silver
Phantom that Fong told us about.

43:20.331 --> 43:21.923
All right, let's get him.

43:35.879 --> 43:37.972
Who are you? What do you want?

43:38.315 --> 43:42.149
It's not important who we are.
What we want is your silence.

43:43.554 --> 43:46.045
Michael, aren't we going to
apprehend him?

43:46.123 --> 43:49.320
Not yet. I want to see
where he's going.

43:53.497 --> 43:56.057
Michael, what on earth
are those bells?

43:56.166 --> 43:59.260
And what on earth is that thing
with people hanging out of it?

44:01.972 --> 44:03.701
It's a cable car, KITT.

44:03.774 --> 44:07.574
Well, right now it's in our way, and
there's no room to turbo boost over it.

44:21.058 --> 44:24.357
All right, let's try and pick
him up. I'm sorry, Michael.

44:24.561 --> 44:26.290
It's okay, pal.

44:27.197 --> 44:31.861
You got a license plate number
for me? 166 UEA. British plates.

44:32.102 --> 44:35.538
All right, pal. That's all
we need. That's all we need.

44:53.457 --> 44:55.254
We gain access here.

44:55.559 --> 45:00.019
We stay in the main tunnel for 480 feet.
That brings us parallel to the main vault.

45:00.431 --> 45:03.559
You shouldn't have to cut through
more than 25 feet to reach it.

45:03.634 --> 45:05.192
That's solid rock.

45:05.302 --> 45:07.065
The bigger the dream, CJ.

45:08.572 --> 45:12.941
Do you really have to smoke that
thing? Practicing for when I'm rich.

45:15.713 --> 45:16.975
Relax.

45:34.765 --> 45:36.460
Hi.
Yes?

45:36.700 --> 45:39.191
You Margo Sheridan?
Possibly. Why?

45:39.436 --> 45:42.735
Name's Michael Knight. I work for
the Foundation for Law and Government.

45:42.806 --> 45:44.433
I gave at the office.

45:44.508 --> 45:47.102
Yeah. Well, do you own
a Silver Phantom...

45:47.177 --> 45:49.873
license plate 166 UEA?

45:50.514 --> 45:51.572
Why?

45:51.648 --> 45:55.482
Well, if you do, I'd like to talk to you
for a minute. Do you mind if I come in?

45:56.620 --> 45:59.111
I'll hold you to your word.
One minute.

45:59.189 --> 46:00.713
Thanks.

46:04.128 --> 46:07.655
Nice house. Just the right
amount of pretentiousness.

46:07.965 --> 46:11.731
I feel better knowing you like
it. Now, what can I do for you?

46:12.169 --> 46:14.364
Your Silver Phantom.
Yes.

46:14.638 --> 46:17.129
Well, unfortunately,
it was stolen from my garage

46:17.207 --> 46:18.435
sometime last night.

46:18.709 --> 46:20.301
Did you report it
to the police?

46:20.377 --> 46:21.969
No, I'm afraid I didn't.

46:22.045 --> 46:24.673
What's one Silver Phantom
more or less, huh?

46:24.748 --> 46:27.842
I'm touched by your concern
for my personal property.

46:30.154 --> 46:31.678
That's hard to get
these days.

46:32.022 --> 46:35.014
Silver Phantoms?
No, Cuban cigars.

46:35.325 --> 46:38.886
That is what I smell,
isn't it? Or is it Jamaican?

46:39.029 --> 46:41.361
You mind if I use
your bathroom?

46:42.699 --> 46:45.327
Mr. Knight, where do you think
you're going?

46:48.238 --> 46:51.207
Dr. Halston, what a surprise.

46:52.476 --> 46:55.570
I guess this is what is known
as private lessons, huh?

46:56.580 --> 46:58.309
Margo and I are old friends.

46:58.382 --> 47:00.077
Your minute is up.

47:04.021 --> 47:08.082
Oh, yes. Well, I'm sorry if
I disturbed you. Not at all.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.388
Incidentally, you're right.
It is Cuban.

47:10.594 --> 47:14.121
Cuban. Well, I know that I
just got here, guys, but...

47:14.731 --> 47:16.255
I really must be going.

47:17.901 --> 47:21.200
Don't tell me. I know. It's
back to the old books again.

47:21.471 --> 47:24.167
How did you know?
ESP.

47:24.942 --> 47:28.503
I do hate to rush you. You've livened
up an otherwise dull afternoon.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.143
Perhaps another time?

47:30.714 --> 47:32.238
It's a crazy world.

47:32.482 --> 47:33.972
Yes. Isn't it?

47:37.521 --> 47:40.081
What was that all about?
And how did he get here?

47:40.157 --> 47:43.320
How isn't important.
I want him killed, David.

47:43.927 --> 47:46.361
And I know just how
I want to do it.

47:53.303 --> 47:54.827
You're wrong, Michael.

47:54.905 --> 47:58.204
Is that why you asked me here?
To spy on Dr. Halston?

47:58.275 --> 48:00.971
Bonnie, I'm sorry. But whether
you like it or not, he's involved.

48:01.044 --> 48:02.170
You don't know that.

48:02.246 --> 48:04.476
Then what was he doing
at Margo Sheridan's house?

48:04.548 --> 48:06.448
Why was he hiding in the den?

48:06.550 --> 48:09.519
Do you know who Margo Sheridan
is? We checked her out.

48:09.586 --> 48:12.054
She's a freelance agent
on the international market.

48:12.122 --> 48:13.612
She walks on both sides
of the street.

48:13.690 --> 48:14.884
He's right, Bonnie.

48:14.958 --> 48:18.086
She deals with everything from
illegal arms to top-secret documents...

48:18.161 --> 48:20.129
without regard for
the consequences.

48:20.197 --> 48:22.256
Her only criteria is money.

48:22.833 --> 48:26.200
If you were talking about anyone
other than David Halston...

48:27.037 --> 48:30.700
He's not some maverick
scientist, he's nationally known.

48:31.341 --> 48:35.209
He conceived the Tri-S Satellite
and developed its microcomputer.

48:35.512 --> 48:37.377
He lectures
across the country.

48:37.447 --> 48:40.712
And more importantly, Michael,
he's been good to me.

48:41.351 --> 48:45.481
Bonnie, look, I know this
isn't easy for you, okay?

48:46.089 --> 48:49.456
But do you remember what we said
to each other at the University?

48:51.128 --> 48:54.325
Okay. What do you
want me to do?

48:54.398 --> 48:56.366
Right now, not a thing.

48:56.633 --> 48:59.796
We just want to know that
you're with us, if we need you.

49:01.605 --> 49:04.267
Was there ever any doubt? No.

49:04.875 --> 49:06.342
Only a moment's hesitation.

49:40.444 --> 49:42.639
They're working their way
through college.

49:42.713 --> 49:45.204
Well, let's hope they're going
for their PhD.

49:45.716 --> 49:48.583
Well, Bubba,
do we have a deal?

49:51.221 --> 49:53.155
You know, if my boss
finds out I'm...

49:53.223 --> 49:55.248
Yeah, but you said
he's out of town, remember?

50:01.365 --> 50:02.593
Let me get this straight.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.362
Now, all you want to do
is to use the basement to...

50:05.435 --> 50:07.630
explore some old Chinese
tunnels. Is that right?

50:07.704 --> 50:08.796
That's right.

50:08.872 --> 50:11.773
What could be simpler?
Or more profitable for you?

50:12.275 --> 50:13.765
$50,000, Bubba.

50:13.844 --> 50:16.642
That's enough to put those foxes
out there through medical school.

50:16.713 --> 50:20.945
But not half enough to pay your medical
bills if you start jerking us around.

50:26.623 --> 50:28.784
You two guys are archeologists
or something?

50:28.859 --> 50:30.622
Look, do we have
a deal or not?

50:37.100 --> 50:38.658
Well, when do I get the money?

50:38.735 --> 50:42.466
You just made
a very wise decision.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.905
Bring in the equipment.

50:45.475 --> 50:46.601
Yeah.

50:55.786 --> 50:58.721
You're all gonna be great
assets to the medical profession.

50:59.089 --> 51:00.420
Come again?

51:07.664 --> 51:11.964
This is certainly a perplexing
case. You got that right.

51:12.035 --> 51:15.869
With CJ Jackson involved, what could
it be other than a bank robbery?

51:16.339 --> 51:18.102
That's a good question.

51:19.042 --> 51:21.670
But somehow my gut tells me
it's something else.

51:21.745 --> 51:23.110
Devon's calling.

51:23.713 --> 51:26.045
Yo, Devon. What's up?
Michael.

51:26.116 --> 51:29.108
I just received a rather
surprising message for you.

51:29.186 --> 51:31.677
Anyone I know?
Margo Sheridan.

51:31.955 --> 51:35.618
She says you intrigue her. She
wants to get to know you better.

51:35.692 --> 51:38.684
She suggests a rendezvous
at the Twin Peaks area...

51:38.762 --> 51:42.698
followed by an intimate afternoon
at her nearby mountain retreat.

51:42.799 --> 51:46.235
Well, that sounds
very intimate.

51:46.369 --> 51:48.894
Anything else?
What more do you expect?

51:49.606 --> 51:51.699
Be careful, Michael.
It could be a trap.

51:51.775 --> 51:55.211
Margo? Devon.
Michael.

51:55.745 --> 51:56.837
I got you.

52:35.485 --> 52:36.975
Scan that car, KITT.

52:40.257 --> 52:42.282
It's Margo, and she's alone.

52:42.359 --> 52:44.122
Michael, to our left.

52:45.562 --> 52:46.893
Got you.

53:05.549 --> 53:07.039
You missed him.

53:11.254 --> 53:14.280
He has another missile,
Michael. I read you, buddy.

53:15.926 --> 53:17.257
I won't miss this time

53:17.327 --> 53:19.261
and you better get out
of there before the explosion.

53:27.604 --> 53:30.164
Michael, he's zeroing in
on my exhaust system.

53:30.240 --> 53:31.673
I read you, pal.

53:36.646 --> 53:38.637
Sorry, pal. Forgive me!
What?

53:47.624 --> 53:48.613
KITT!

54:01.404 --> 54:02.701
KITT?

54:05.242 --> 54:08.040
KITT, you okay, buddy?

54:16.753 --> 54:19.688
Oh, KITT, he really did it
to you this time.

54:20.590 --> 54:23.320
Bonnie.
KITT, did you say something?

54:23.960 --> 54:26.394
Bonnie, is that you?

54:26.830 --> 54:30.630
It's me, KITT. I'm here.
I feel so weak.

54:31.501 --> 54:35.335
Where are we?
Everything is so dark.

54:35.505 --> 54:36.972
Is it night?

54:37.507 --> 54:39.771
Yeah. Don't worry.

54:40.844 --> 54:42.311
I'll take care of you.

54:42.379 --> 54:45.906
I don't know what I would do
without you, Bonnie.

54:50.086 --> 54:52.213
Michael, you can't do it.
Why not?

54:52.722 --> 54:54.883
That house is the hub,
so is Margo.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.659
I feel like an Indian circling
the fort and being shot at.

54:58.728 --> 55:01.993
What you propose to do is certainly
no solution, quite the contrary.

55:02.065 --> 55:06.024
All you'll succeed in doing will be
to present them with a better target.

55:06.503 --> 55:09.199
If that's what it takes,
that's what it takes.

55:09.606 --> 55:10.698
Blimey.

55:24.788 --> 55:28.417
Can't you exercise without
all that grunting?

55:41.104 --> 55:42.128
Hi.

55:42.539 --> 55:46.600
I guess we got our signals crossed. I
could have sworn you said Twin Peaks.

55:46.676 --> 55:50.942
Twin Peaks. Yes, I'm sorry.
Did you wait long?

55:51.014 --> 55:54.609
No, not very long. As it turned
out, I had plenty to keep me busy.

55:54.818 --> 55:58.447
You won't mind if I come in?
Of course. By all means.

55:59.789 --> 56:01.086
Oh, hi, guys.

56:05.261 --> 56:07.889
I was hoping for a little bit
more privacy.

56:08.331 --> 56:09.730
These are for you.

56:11.134 --> 56:14.467
Go chase a bone.
And take that stuff with you.

56:20.009 --> 56:22.034
I didn't catch you
at a bad time, did I?

56:22.112 --> 56:25.604
No. As a matter of fact, you
couldn't have picked a better time.

56:25.682 --> 56:27.013
Terrific.

56:31.354 --> 56:34.812
Thank heaven your Self Diagnostic
Routine is still intact.

56:34.891 --> 56:37.519
Let's see what the damage is.

56:39.796 --> 56:44.028
It's worse than I thought. How
could anyone have done this to you?

56:48.071 --> 56:51.802
At least a dozen of your CPU
components have been short-circuited.

56:53.943 --> 56:56.241
Most of your memory bank
is destroyed.

56:58.281 --> 57:01.409
And your miniature relays
are badly damaged.

57:02.285 --> 57:05.254
KITT, I'm gonna make you
as good as new.

57:06.623 --> 57:09.524
No, I'm gonna make you better.

58:33.476 --> 58:35.603
I can't work with all this
dirt piling up.

58:35.678 --> 58:37.942
Hey, I'm shoveling
as fast as I can.

58:38.014 --> 58:39.447
The way you shovel,
I don't know how...

58:39.516 --> 58:41.677
your people got these tunnels
dug in the first place.

58:41.751 --> 58:43.514
No more racial slurs.

58:43.586 --> 58:47.078
One more racial slur and you can
shovel your own dirt yourself.

58:47.423 --> 58:49.721
Break time. Break time.

58:51.895 --> 58:54.762
Well, look who dropped in,
Doctor Feel Good.

58:54.831 --> 58:57.197
How's it coming?
It's coming.

58:57.267 --> 59:00.964
Good. I'd hate to think we did
everything right but dig fast enough.

59:04.073 --> 59:06.041
So, show me
where we are.

59:12.215 --> 59:15.309
Right about here.
15 or 20 more feet, we got it.

59:15.385 --> 59:19.014
Incidentally, if you were concerned
about Michael Knight, don't be.

59:19.322 --> 59:23.588
He and that car of his met with an
unfortunate accident earlier this afternoon.

59:23.726 --> 59:28.060
So now nothing stands in our
way except 15 feet of dirt.

59:34.537 --> 59:36.767
So tell me, what do you do,
Michael Knight?

59:36.839 --> 59:40.002
Besides trace missing cars
and tempt lonely women?

59:40.410 --> 59:42.674
You strike me as anything
but lonely.

59:42.979 --> 59:45.607
If you mean Clifton and Turk,
you're mistaken.

59:45.815 --> 59:49.342
They're overgrown children.
They'd be lost without me.

59:50.620 --> 59:55.250
And what about David Halston?
Would he be lost without you, too?

59:55.558 --> 59:58.550
David? No, he's terribly
self-sufficient.

59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.362
And very possessive.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:04.156
Why do you say that? I saw
the way he looked at you.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:07.164
Probably because he saw
the way I looked at you.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.207
Is something wrong?

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:16.370
Well, I feel a little bit like
the baby-sitter's boyfriend.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.244
You know, afraid the kids
will pop in any moment.

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:24.619
I have just the place in mind.
It's very private.

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.146
Give me five minutes.

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:33.157
I'll be counting.
So will I.

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:23.612
You were right.
The kids did pop in.

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:01.278
I'll go for it.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.986
Well, I'm not jumping.

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:09.881
Clifton, she's not gonna be
too happy about this.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:28.475
This is it, Devon. All we need
to tie Halston to the drone.

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:31.445
Yes, if Bonnie can break down
its components, its programs.

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:33.675
I'll have to use the
facilities at the University.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.240
All right, I'll go with you.

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:36.649
Thanks, but I'd rather
go alone.

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:38.710
No way.
It's too dangerous.

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.722
Michael, I can handle myself.

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:44.415
Besides, I can get through a lot
faster without you getting in my way.

01:02:45.528 --> 01:02:47.723
Micro torque, please.
What?

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:51.090
The micro torque ratchet. It's
next to the exhaust alternators.

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:53.931
I believe this is the object
in question. Thank you.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.905
Laser diode.

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:01.034
Laser diode.
That's it.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.409
You know, I could just come in
there and help you.

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:06.470
It'd be a lot easier.

01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:07.573
No.

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:11.981
Bonnie, I could scrub down. Honest.
Devon can certify me germ-free.

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:15.485
Guess not.

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:18.225
Just like old times, huh?
Don't kid yourself.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:22.196
Bonnie, how much longer is this going to
take? We're on a tight schedule, you know.

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.664
I'm finished.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.791
But I haven't checked out
all his systems yet.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:30.305
Very well, I'll arrange for
transportation for you to the University.

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:32.705
KITT's final checkup
will have to wait.

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:35.300
On one condition.
What?

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.242
No peeking.

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:41.274
Moi?

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.453
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:20.979
Thanks for calling,
Lieutenant.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.120
What?

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:30.026
The body of a girl named Su-Lin was
fished out of the bay this evening.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.464
Su-Lin. That's Peter Wong's
girl friend.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:34.764
That's right.

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:38.273
The police think she may have
been killed somewhere else.

01:04:38.608 --> 01:04:41.338
They have no motive as yet.
Motive, what motive?

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:45.172
She was in love with the wrong guy.
She probably knew a little too much.

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.510
Yes.

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:48.444
One thing is for sure...

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:51.477
these fellows are playing
for keeps.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:55.081
Two things for sure, Bonnie's
been gone for over two hours.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.591
Two hours
and 17 minutes precisely.

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:01.627
She'd never forgive you.

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:04.757
I'd rather have her not forgive me
than not be around to make that choice.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.461
Halston's capable of anything.

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:09.026
Well, I won't try to stop you.
Let's go.

01:05:09.405 --> 01:05:11.066
Ready or not.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.566
Well...

01:05:16.212 --> 01:05:18.680
how you feeling, buddy?
Take a look, Michael.

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:26.084
All right, here goes.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.092
Remarkable.

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:42.464
Looks like you got a serious face-lift.
Bonnie added some new functions.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.369
This is my self-analyzing
probe.

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:51.409
In conjunction with
my new onboard computer...

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.643
it can isolate and diagnose
virtually any malfunction.

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:58.580
Wow.
Thank you.

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.718
Now if I only knew
what some of these things do.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:06.421
Only one way to find out, Michael,
but don't push the Turbo Boost.

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:08.793
He's still got
his sense of humor.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:12.559
All right, here goes, IGP.

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:20.668
That stands for my new 3-dimensional
Interactive Graphics Plotter.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:22.768
What's that?

01:06:22.845 --> 01:06:25.643
Let's say we run up against
someone wearing a disguise...

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:29.048
and want to find out who he
really is. Like this man here.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.784
I hope you don't run into him
in a dark alley.

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:36.023
I simply break down his face
with my IGP.

01:06:36.225 --> 01:06:39.285
Then activate my Linear
Predictive Graphics Routine...

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:43.423
and voila, a 3-D
reconstruction of the real face.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:46.559
You're right, I wouldn't want
to run into him in a dark alley.

01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:50.162
What else you got, buddy?
That's my Thermodynamic System.

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:51.665
Sounds hot.

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:55.541
That little flashing red light, Michael,
represents 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:58.546
Enough to expand
and eventually melt steel.

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:03.848
EGM?
Electrical Generating Mode.

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:07.116
Puts out enough current
to power a small city.

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:08.818
Shocking.
Shocking.

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:11.359
And then there's my new
Polyphonic Synthesizer...

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:14.828
which allows me to duplicate and
project any sound from anywhere.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:22.360
I get the message.
Let's go get Bonnie.

01:07:57.506 --> 01:07:59.872
Devon, it's me.
Michael was right.

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:01.876
Halston might as well
have autographed the CPU.

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:04.572
He used a microchip
he designed for the Tri-S.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.575
It's not even in
production yet.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:13.103
You know, my great grandfather
spent half his life in tunnels.

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:16.777
I end up doing the same thing.
Only in America.

01:09:16.919 --> 01:09:19.888
Yeah, well, I quit.

01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:24.622
Now, you pick it up.
Hey.

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:27.321
I'm a wireman,
not a tunnel digger.

01:09:27.395 --> 01:09:30.832
You're either a tunnel digger or a
gravedigger. Now take your choice.

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.399
Now shovel.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:48.282
Michael, since I talked you the
police have put out an APB on her.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:52.116
Devon, the CPU is also missing.
Halston must have surprised her.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:55.248
Yes, I'm sure you're right, Michael.
The question is where has he taken her?

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.622
We'll find out.
Count on it.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:10.062
Let go of me
you big anthropoid!

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:13.233
I've been called worse things.
I think.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.475
What are you going to do with her?
This should put her out for a long time.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.672
Not long enough.

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:20.578
I'm not gonna kill her
if that's what you mean.

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:22.139
If you haven't got the guts
for it...

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:25.745
I'm sure one of my little playmates
would be more than happy to oblige.

01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:29.587
Margo, I might be a lot of things
but a murderer is not one of them.

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:34.254
David, as long as I'm in charge
here, and I am in charge here...

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:37.631
you are exactly
what I say you are.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:44.095
Just make sure she doesn't
get in the way.

01:10:44.773 --> 01:10:46.900
You can't do this to me!

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:49.736
I've always looked up to you.
Hold her arm.

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.279
Respected you.

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:53.908
I...

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:57.675
All right, take her in
the other room and tie her up.

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:04.585
I talked to my contact
a little while ago.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:08.221
I assured him nothing would
go wrong. And nothing will.

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:10.623
For your sake, David,
I hope not.

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.634
Ready, boys?

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:19.334
I smell rain in the air.
Tonight you'll sleep inside.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:39.386
Do you really think those two
gorillas know where Bonnie is, Michael?

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:43.022
Yes. But knowing and telling
are two different things.

01:11:43.098 --> 01:11:45.430
I'm sure you'll figure out
a way to make them talk.

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:48.265
Well, thanks for
the vote of confidence.

01:11:55.244 --> 01:11:58.543
Michael, my scanner tells me if
you so much as touch that fence...

01:11:58.614 --> 01:12:00.980
it's going to activate
an alarm inside.

01:12:03.218 --> 01:12:06.051
KITT, let me have that
new voltage induction coil.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.450
Thanks.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:16.054
Okay, KITT, disappear.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.042
It's at the front gate.

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:33.081
Probably just a squirrel
again, I'll go check it out.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.400
All right, give him
some juice.

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:06.813
Morning, Clifton. Rather
electrifying day, don't you think?

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:20.554
Clifton!

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:31.963
Clifton, is that
that new breakdancing stuff?

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.540
Hey, that's pretty good.

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:40.480
You guys keep that up, I could get
you a couple of weeks in Las Vegas.

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:45.217
Now I'm going to ask you
one question, one time...

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:47.881
and you better come up
with the right answer.

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:50.023
Where's Bonnie?

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.659
All right, suit yourself.

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:59.530
Give them some more juice.
One fresh squeeze DC coming up.

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:17.208
Okay, bring them down
a little bit.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:25.256
Where's Bonnie?
At the boatyard.

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:29.161
What boatyard?
Hunters Point.

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:34.469
What building?
The electronics building.

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:35.662
You got that?

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:38.137
Yes, Michael, the electronics
building at Hunters Point.

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:40.072
Okay, notify Devon to have
the authorities...

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.440
pick up the electric
muscle necks, will you?

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.240
Accessories to kidnapping.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:46.408
Turn them off.

01:15:12.374 --> 01:15:14.638
It's too quiet, Michael,
I don't like it.

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:16.437
Your scanner pick up anything,
buddy?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.948
I'm sorry, Michael, even with my
new ATX surveillance equipment...

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:22.483
there's just too much electrical
interference around here...

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:25.281
for me to tell if there's
anyone inside or not.

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:29.214
Well, there's one way to find
out. Tell them I'm going in.

01:15:29.291 --> 01:15:31.088
Good luck.
Thanks.

01:15:32.628 --> 01:15:34.653
You ready, pal?
Ready, Michael.

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.027
Let's do it.

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:04.890
There's no one here!

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:24.442
More flash!

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:27.740
More flash!

01:16:27.816 --> 01:16:29.215
More cash?

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:35.049
Turn down the music,
you might be able to hear me!

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:36.951
What?

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:46.962
Where did you learn
how to do that?

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.760
It's something you have
to be born with.

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:52.568
Like having an ear for music.

01:16:52.641 --> 01:16:55.838
Well, I'll have to admit you're Rod
Stewart and Prince rolled into one.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:17:00.180
Coming from you, CJ,
that's a real compliment.

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:15.020
Now this is what I call
room service.

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:17.930
Did you bring one for CJ?
Don't get any ideas.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.058
Hey, what is this all about?
It's a long story.

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:25.129
But don't worry. By the time she
comes to we'll be far away from here.

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:26.231
How's it coming?

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.708
I should have those alarms
neutralized in a couple of hours.

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:30.711
The vault?
By daybreak.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:33.009
Exactly on schedule.
Excellent.

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.912
I better let you get back
to work then. Wait a minute.

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:38.544
What are we supposed to do if
she comes to before we finish?

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:41.987
She won't, but if she does
I'm sure you can handle it.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.550
No sweat.

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:04.769
Feeding time!

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:08.312
Hi, guys. How are they treating you?
I'll tear your head off, pencil neck.

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:10.851
Come on, no hard feelings.

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:15.720
My motto is let bygones be bygones. Win
some, lose some. Every dog has its day.

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:23.192
Oh, this. It's just
a little pain inducer.

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.424
Pain inducer?
Yeah, state of the art.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.663
It's part of a computerized
program to test tolerance levels.

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:33.106
You see this dial? It goes all the way from
drilling into the nerve of a bad tooth...

01:18:33.175 --> 01:18:36.338
all the way up
to being burned at the stake.

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:37.901
Which do you prefer?

01:18:40.749 --> 01:18:44.276
Okay, then why don't we just start
with the old drill-into-the-nerve bit...

01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:46.343
and work our way
up the ladder?

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.514
What do you want to know?

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:52.583
Why did you kill that old man
in Chinatown?

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:53.923
We didn't kill anyone.

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:57.522
The police have your fingerprints and
someone ID'd you leaving the scene.

01:18:57.599 --> 01:19:00.932
And there's the little matter
of Peter Wong's girlfriend.

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.267
Suit yourself, no answer.

01:19:03.905 --> 01:19:07.932
Well, then why don't we just skip
number one and go all the way up to...

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.075
thirteen?

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:15.877
Margo told us
to get some maps.

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:18.475
What maps?
Of the Chinese tunnels.

01:19:18.687 --> 01:19:21.247
Why did she want maps
of the Chinese tunnels?

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:22.987
We don't know.

01:19:23.492 --> 01:19:26.017
She didn't tell us.
That's the truth.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:31.460
Okay. Thank you very much,
guys.

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.526
By the way...

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.663
you ought to get one of these little
squirt guns. They're pretty nifty.

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:41.904
You assured me nothing
would go wrong.

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:45.378
No, I assured you that you'd be able to
make delivery on schedule, and you will.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.245
And what about my little pets? They
were this far from being housebroken.

01:19:48.316 --> 01:19:50.682
Clifton and Turk? You should have
had your lawyer bail them out.

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:54.051
I tried that. They refused bail.
I don't understand why. Margo...

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:55.783
they know nothing
about our plans.

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:58.758
If they did and they talked, the
police would be here right now.

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.924
As for their other talents,
I...

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:07.963
Well, I'm already housebroken.

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:12.806
That's what's wrong with you,
David. You were born housebroken.

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.648
The Chinese immigrants who
first came to San Francisco...

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:29.849
honeycombed the city
with tunnels.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:33.927
They created a whole underground
to smuggle in illegal immigrants.

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:37.723
KITT, access everything you've got on
the Chinese tunnels underneath the city.

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:39.323
Coming right up.

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:46.697
The Chinese tunnels, Michael.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:50.575
Pinpoint the location of the
major vaults. How major is "major"?

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:53.546
Anything designed to safe keep
over $1 million.

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:55.139
That might take some time.

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:57.845
Time's what we don't have,
KITT. Now step on it.

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:39.952
Well, what do you know? The
sleeping princess is awake.

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:43.957
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:47.833
Then let me go. I can't do
that, but I'll get you a drink.

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:51.202
No, thanks.
Well, suit yourself.

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.941
Hey, how long
has this been here?

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:03.074
Guess Halston wanted us
to rock and work.

01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:05.381
Yeah, sure, now that
all the work is done.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.449
CJ.
What?

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:10.115
Something's wrong here.

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:13.924
What are you talking about?
We dug in the wrong direction.

01:22:14.996 --> 01:22:16.725
Here, look for yourself.
Look.

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:19.062
Here's the club.
Here's where we started.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:22.028
Now Halston told us to dig
in that direction.

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:24.333
Only problem is, is that
the bank is over there.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:27.398
You crazy? I'm down here
in a tunnel with a killer...

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:30.501
digging in the wrong direction,
and you ask me if I'm crazy?

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:32.738
Sorry, brother.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:37.378
I wonder what's in that
vault there. I don't know.

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:40.182
But the bank's that way.

01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:04.511
I had a feeling it wouldn't be
much of a match.

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:10.579
What's this all about?
About, CJ?

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:15.416
It's about getting what you want in
life. About what's rightfully yours.

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:19.188
The bank vault's over
there. I know that.

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.125
It's not money I'm after.

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:25.358
If it were, I could simply
peddle my own inventions. No.

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:30.070
Just as poor Peter over there
wanted his name on Fong's Delight...

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:32.436
the recognition
that he created it.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:36.170
I want the world to know that I
created what's in that vault over there.

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.677
And what's that?

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:41.477
The Tri-S, the Surveillance
and Strike Satellite.

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:45.508
It was my conception. I
designed it and I gave it life.

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:48.817
And if our government
won't give me my due credit...

01:23:49.124 --> 01:23:51.388
I'm sure that
another government will.

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:55.893
No, it's not money that
I'm after, CJ, but glory.

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:58.460
And power.

01:24:09.911 --> 01:24:12.345
You're insane.
Perhaps I am.

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:15.007
That's all the more reason
for you to behave.

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:43.006
Here are the locations
of all the major vaults.

01:24:43.478 --> 01:24:45.639
Sorry it took so long,
Michael.

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:49.409
All right, bring the lower
quadrant into close-up.

01:24:53.254 --> 01:24:56.314
The center dot, screen left,
why isn't that pulsating?

01:24:56.391 --> 01:25:00.919
That particular vault doesn't contain money.
It belongs to the Megafax Research Center.

01:25:01.396 --> 01:25:04.524
Megafax Research Center?
You're familiar with it?

01:25:04.599 --> 01:25:08.228
Yes, it's a private company with a
number of Defense Department contracts.

01:25:08.303 --> 01:25:12.034
In fact, unless I'm mistaken,
Dr. Halston was in charge of one.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:15.634
The Surveillance and Strike
Satellite Bonnie mentioned. Only...

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:16.972
Only what?

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:19.171
I seem to remember
reading that...

01:25:19.247 --> 01:25:21.772
there was some talk amongst
the scientific community...

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:24.751
that Megafax had refused to
give him full credit for it.

01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:28.653
And now he wants it back. I knew
it wasn't money he was after.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.384
KITT, if Halston wanted the
most direct underground route...

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:34.121
into the Megafax vault,
where would he start digging?

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:40.831
Right beneath
the Golden Fox Club, Michael.

01:25:40.902 --> 01:25:42.597
Golden Fox, that's a go.

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:34.710
I'll take that.

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.814
Michael!
Stay where you are!

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:44.919
Get in.

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:46.083
Get in.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.287
If you try and follow us,
she's dead. Remember that.

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:49.523
Now you hurt her...

01:27:49.597 --> 01:27:53.556
and there's not a place on this Earth
that I won't find you. You remember that.

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:08.915
All right, as soon as they get far enough
ahead we'll tail them on your Infrared.

01:28:10.818 --> 01:28:14.879
Michael, I'm truly worried about
Bonnie. Yeah, I am, too, pal.

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:18.624
But as long as she's in that car
we're not gonna be too far behind.

01:28:19.527 --> 01:28:20.721
Let's go.

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:47.621
Michael, they're approximately
two-and-a-half blocks ahead.

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:57.854
I'm telling you he's
following us. Of course he is.

01:28:57.932 --> 01:29:01.993
What are you going to do about it?
Get him off our backs once and for all.

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:23.288
I can't remember when I've
enjoyed myself more, Arthur.

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.950
Me neither, Henrietta.

01:29:31.432 --> 01:29:32.922
Michael, behind us.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.893
Is it armed?
With those dreadful missiles.

01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.062
All right.

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:40.872
Let's see if we can buy a little time
with your new Traffic Control System.

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:17.935
Young man, take us to the airport.
Yeah, we can send for our luggage later.

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:27.780
KITT, scan those piers. Maybe we can
get some idea where they're going.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:36.087
That chopper could be it. See if
you can get me a reading on it.

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:40.233
It's owned by
Hydra Enterprises...

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:42.496
suspected of being a front
for the terrorist wing...

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.731
of the Middle Eastern
Communist Alliance.

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:46.501
All right, give me Devon.

01:30:46.574 --> 01:30:49.771
Michael, where are you?
Devon, I'm at the Embarcadero.

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:53.041
I'm gonna need some backup.
Michael, look ahead of us.

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:56.475
I see them, buddy.
There's another one behind us.

01:30:58.152 --> 01:31:02.316
All right, monitor their firing mechanisms.
Tell me the instant they're activated.

01:31:11.399 --> 01:31:12.627
Now.

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:24.039
Did it work?
I don't believe it.

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.877
You idiot!

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:31.642
If I ever run for president, I'll
be sure to make you my running mate.

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.346
It would be a first.

01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:34.839
Don't.

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:40.653
Margo, you're not gonna believe this,
but my partner is right behind you.

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:42.386
Good idea, Michael.

01:32:42.456 --> 01:32:45.482
Michael, you're a man of
many extraordinary talents...

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.289
but lying is not one of them.

01:32:47.361 --> 01:32:49.522
All right, suit yourself.

01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:52.627
KITT, she's all yours.

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:57.666
Put down the gun, Margo.

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:08.807
Nice work, KITT.

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:25.930
Hey, can you untie me?
I'm glad we found you.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:34.568
KITT, I need a hand, buddy.
Right away, Michael.

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:39.038
How about two hands?

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:41.843
Welcome back, Bonnie.
Thanks, KITT.

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:56.992
Okay, pal.

01:33:58.265 --> 01:33:59.664
Anchors away.

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:25.150
Well, pal, it's off to
the briny deep.

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:28.593
Following the North Star,
sailing over the waves.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:31.894
Really, Michael, I'm getting
seasick just listening to you.

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:35.599
Oh, no. What does he want?

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.703
I thought you might need
a first mate.

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:45.905
As long as it's not another
assignment. My word on it.

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:48.208
Glad to have you aboard.
Thank you.

01:34:48.749 --> 01:34:51.980
How about a second mate?
You can sail with me anytime.

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:56.146
For the entire cruise?
No kidding?

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:57.917
No kidding.

01:34:58.325 --> 01:35:01.226
Welcome back! That's terrific.

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:03.058
Lead the way,
Captain.

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:07.023
All right, going to slip
number 3.

01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:08.568
I can't look.

01:35:14.175 --> 01:35:16.643
Wow, is that it?

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:21.011
No. That's it.

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:26.786
Mates, what do you say we
go have lunch? Good idea.

01:35:26.854 --> 01:35:28.446
Yes, I'll even pay.
I don't believe it.

01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:30.752
So long as it doesn't
exceed $650.
