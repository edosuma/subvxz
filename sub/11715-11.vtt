an egg white omelet

00:05.213 --> 00:06.548

00:08.008 --> 00:09.635
And I will have
a regular omelet
with ham and cheese.

And can you take the yos
that you don't use in hs

It is, good catch.

You know that
I don't like other peop.

Yeah, well, other people
feel the same about you.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.756

00:55.014 --> 00:58.433
Check out what I got Jen
for our four-year anniversa.

00:58.475 --> 00:59.935
Of what,
the first time you did ?

01:02.479 --> 01:03.898
No, of the night we met.

01:03.939 --> 01:07.651
It was the same night.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.110
Yeah, she did not
make me earn it.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.531
Okay, look.
Four flavors of popcorn.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.158
One for each year
we've been together.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.538
Nice.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.040
Huh?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.000
She is one lucky lady.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.294
You wanna give me
a handful of cheddar?

01:26.336 --> 01:27.546
No, no, no, no, no.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.966
Then the quadrants
won't be even.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.634
Come on, give me some,
I need it.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.344

You sound like Jen
the night we met.

Hey, guess what,
we're having dinner
with them tomorrow nigh.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.979
Come on, you couldn't
get out of that?

01:44.021 --> 01:46.440
No, I'm the one
who suggested it.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.442
Great, fine, I will eat,

01:48.483 --> 01:50.110
but don't expect me
to turn on the charm.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.948
I'm pretty sure
that switch

01:53.989 --> 01:57.576
has been locked
in the off position.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.994
What's with
all the popcorn?

01:59.036 --> 02:00.328
Oh, it's an anniversary
gift for Jen.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.080
Huh.

02:02.831 --> 02:08.420
Guess there are
worse things
than forgetting.

the lifeblood of the ci,

of lives intersect

02:52.965 --> 02:55.342
before radiating outward
in a thousand
different directions.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.384
It smells funny.

catching blowback

03:00.055 --> 03:01.473
from your Axe body wash.

That could be it.

I smell wee-wee.
We're cabbing it.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.096
And then we did
the whole, you know,
share desserts thing

03:41.138 --> 03:42.597
before
calling it a night.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.307
So long story short,
we had a great evening.

03:46.018 --> 03:47.019
Long story short
would have been

03:47.061 --> 03:48.353
we had fun
with the Harrises.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.273
Yours was
a long story longer.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.736
Well, it sounds
like it was a success.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.155
Mr. People person
over here even asked

03:58.197 --> 04:00.490
if we could get together
this evening.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.576
I asked Jane, she thougt
that they had other plas

04:02.617 --> 04:04.578
but then Paul reminded r
that they didn't,
so we made a date.

Boom, four words.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.499
I got four words...

04:09.541 --> 04:10.542
I want a divorce.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.172
"Divorce me"
would be shorter.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.550
Anyway, who knew
we'd find a couple
in the building

04:18.592 --> 04:24.723
we both like
hanging out with?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.642
We live in the building.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.019
Oh, no,
Jeff didn't mean that.

04:34.566 --> 04:35.776
What did I mean?

04:37.903 --> 04:39.613
Fine, guess we won't
invite them over
to eat popcorn.

04:39.654 --> 04:40.572
Ugh.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.533
Enough with the popcorn.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.952
What? What, honey,
I thought you liked it.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.371
It was okay at first
but I'm so sick of it.

everywhere.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.711
I want it out
of the house.

Fine, if it goes,
then I go.

I wasn't looking

13:25.096 --> 13:26.306
I couldn't find my guys.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.517
Don't care.

13:31.394 --> 13:32.937
Well, so I thought
I'd try to find them

13:32.979 --> 13:36.483
using that
Missed Connections website.

13:36.524 --> 13:37.734
You know, like...
Like Timmy did.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.736
Yeah, still don't care.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.239
Here's what
I'm gonna post.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.200
"30-year-old man
seeking young ethnic boys."

13:49.954 --> 13:51.539
All right,
sort of care now.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.544
"We hooked up yesterday
for some sweet banging
and jamming.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.049
"And I'm looking
to get it on again."

14:05.595 --> 14:08.598
So...you see nothing wrg
with that?

14:12.811 --> 14:13.645
Oh, my God,
you're right.

14:13.687 --> 14:14.521
Mmm-hmm.

14:16.564 --> 14:26.533
I almost forgot to put
my contact information.

14:26.574 --> 14:27.325
Hey.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.619
Hey, Jeff,
how you doing, buddy?

14:29.661 --> 14:30.453
Jane, Paul.

14:30.953 --> 14:31.830
All right.

14:40.755 --> 14:41.506
So...

14:44.050 --> 14:45.301
Apparently I'm not
your cup of tea.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.304
Oh, my God,
did Audrey...
No, it's okay.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.682
I... I was just wonderi,

14:51.641 --> 14:54.268
uh, what about me
specifically

14:55.061 --> 14:57.230
was not to your liking?

14:57.271 --> 14:59.357
Look, Audrey
kinda put us on the spo.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.066
All right,
we didn't know
what to say.

15:00.107 --> 15:00.900
But...

15:03.069 --> 15:03.986
Thanks, hon.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.073
Well, the truth
of the matter is...

15:08.115 --> 15:10.201
It was really Audrey

15:10.243 --> 15:11.870
that we felt like
we didn't quite click w.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.163
Yes, but please
don't tell Audrey.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.541
We don't wanna hurt
her feelings.
No.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.500
Nor would I.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.838
It was you.

15:21.880 --> 15:32.139
It was you they hated.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.016
Well, I hope
you're satisfied.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.059
I am not.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.565
I can't believe
you need a key card
to get in the stairwell.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.360
Thanks to you,
every freak on the subwy

15:45.695 --> 15:49.490
has called me offering
to do unspeakable thing.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.409
Once again, sir,
you've turned my life
into a living hell.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.954
I was just trying
to help you find the gi.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.081
Right, just so
that you could prove

15:57.123 --> 15:58.792
there's no such thing
as love at first sight.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.834
(SOFTLY GROANS)

16:01.001 --> 16:03.963
I'm going home now, sir.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.758
Another night...
Another chance for me
to die in my sleep

16:06.800 --> 16:10.344
from an undetected
carbon monoxide leak.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.721
Before you go...

16:12.305 --> 16:13.556
Yes.
(SIGHS)

16:13.598 --> 16:14.641
She's in there.

16:14.682 --> 16:15.475
Who is?

16:16.601 --> 16:19.019
The chick you saw.

16:19.061 --> 16:19.896
(WHISTLES)

16:20.313 --> 16:21.021
What?

16:23.900 --> 16:27.236
That is her.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.531
She responded
to your ridiculous
subway ad?

16:30.573 --> 16:32.617
No, uh, it was
that thing you posted
on Missed Connections.

16:33.868 --> 16:34.911
(SATISFIED HUM)

16:42.710 --> 16:44.629
And to think you didn't
believe it could happen.

16:45.087 --> 16:45.839
(SIGHS)

16:47.381 --> 16:49.425
Well, despite that
lump of coal

16:49.467 --> 16:50.844
in your boyish
little chicken chest,

16:54.388 --> 16:56.474
you'll see that romance
ultimately wins out.

16:58.685 --> 17:08.569
(DEEP BREATH)

17:08.611 --> 17:09.320
Hi.

17:10.154 --> 17:10.822
Hi.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.910
It's so nice
to see you again.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.077
I'm sorry,
who are you?

17:20.999 --> 17:22.500
Um, I... I'm Timmy.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.129
You... You know,
we saw each other
on the subway.

17:27.171 --> 17:27.964
Oh, no.

17:30.633 --> 17:54.240
You're not the guy
that I saw.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.491
So, um...

17:57.785 --> 17:59.579
You weren't
looking at me?

17:59.620 --> 18:00.246
(KNOCKS)

18:01.163 --> 18:04.375
Couldn't help
but overhear.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.626
She wasn't
looking at you.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.089
I'm so sorry
for the misunderstandin.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.674
Sorry? You have nothing
to be sorry about.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.133
I'm Russell.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.097
Please, sir,
I beg of you, don't say.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.181
You know, Tim...

18:23.436 --> 18:26.606
I wanted to
teach you something.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.399
But in all actuality,
you taught me something.

18:30.150 --> 18:33.195
Now I do believe
in love at first sight.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.488
Because I love
what I just saw.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.490
(LAUGHS)

18:36.991 --> 18:37.825
Too good.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.123
I'm just telling you
what they said,

18:44.164 --> 18:45.625
so don't shoot
the messenger.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.793
Who they like
better than you.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.965
They were trapped
in an elevator with you.

18:52.006 --> 18:57.511
Said whatever they thout
would save them
from getting eaten.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.180
Well, you had them
cornered in
that pizza place,

19:00.222 --> 19:01.933
probably threatened
to tell them
that story again

19:01.975 --> 19:03.434
about who stole
your yogurt at work.

19:05.686 --> 19:06.353
Okay.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.940
That is a good story
with a surprise twist.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.443
Surprise! I just wasted
five minutes of your li.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.490
Face it, Jeff.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.659
I didn't blow this
for us. You did.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.785
There's only
one way to be sure.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.869
(FRANTIC KNOCKING)

19:23.746 --> 19:25.123
Hi, I'm sorry
to bother you.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.667
We need you to settle
something for us.

19:27.708 --> 19:28.584
Yeah.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.216
(LAUGHS)
So it turns out they
hated both of us.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.804
Yep,
they found me pushy.

19:40.930 --> 19:42.473
I've got the table manns
of a chimp.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.893
Oh, plus you're cheap.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.103
Oh, and we're too critil
of each other.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.312
Which makes people
uncomfortable.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.438
Although
that one's more you.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.397
Oh, try a breath mint.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.110
Well, at least
you have each other.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.945
And us.
Mmm-hmm.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.947
Yeah,
it's an embarrassment.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.241
Of riches?

20:03.161 --> 20:03.953
Sure.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.004
And then, when she said

20:13.046 --> 20:14.296
she was looking
at the other guy...

20:14.338 --> 20:15.882
(LAUGHS) Whoo.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.888
You should have
seen the light die
in little Tim's eyes.

20:25.683 --> 20:27.060
"Don't go to New York,"
they said.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.314
"The people aren't nice"
they said.

20:33.524 --> 20:34.483
Adam Rhodes?

20:34.859 --> 20:35.609
Yes?

20:37.987 --> 20:40.073
Did you post a solicitan
on Missed Connections?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.119
Yeah, hey,
is everything okay?

20:45.870 --> 20:49.373
Did you find my boys?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.875
Sir, we need you
to come with us.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.419
Yeah, sure,
anything I can do to he.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.172
Can't wait to play
with those boys again.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.592
Let's go.
