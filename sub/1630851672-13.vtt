WEBVTT

00:01.671 --> 00:03.412
because we couldn't
face each other if we didn't.

00:03.543 --> 00:05.414
I want us
to have a family.

00:07.590 --> 00:09.244
We want to find Padre.

00:09.375 --> 00:11.029
You're going to help us.

00:11.159 --> 00:13.118
So, where will you go?The bunker.

00:13.248 --> 00:14.467
There's a working transmitter
down there,

00:14.597 --> 00:16.077
and I need it
to reach people.

00:16.208 --> 00:17.557
You still looking?
For what?

00:17.687 --> 00:19.124
A partner.

00:19.254 --> 00:21.430
-We need to move.
-I'll buy you some time.

00:21.561 --> 00:22.910
Take care of her,
Morgan.I will.

00:25.304 --> 00:27.088
You may have won the battle
today, Morgan,

00:27.219 --> 00:29.134
but the war
is just beginning.

01:21.055 --> 01:22.361
Honey?

01:25.320 --> 01:27.192
Hey, honey,
where the hell are you?

01:27.322 --> 01:28.541
Yeah, what is it, D?

01:28.671 --> 01:31.152
You left
without waking me up.

01:33.198 --> 01:35.374
You needed the sleep.

01:35.504 --> 01:39.160
Okay. Where -- Where are you?

01:39.291 --> 01:41.162
I'm on a supply run.

01:41.293 --> 01:43.295
I remember we never hit up
that warehouse

01:43.425 --> 01:46.385
near the train depot.

01:46.515 --> 01:47.777
And?

01:50.606 --> 01:52.347
Nada.

01:52.478 --> 01:53.609
Okay, well,
I got something.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.176
We got an SOS.

01:55.307 --> 01:57.744
On the Dark Horse channel? Yes, yeah.

01:57.874 --> 01:59.876
Some lady, uh, got herself
turned around

02:00.007 --> 02:01.400
down near the inlet.

02:01.530 --> 02:02.792
I'll meet you at the sub.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.620
No, I-I don't think
she can wait.

02:04.751 --> 02:06.535
Well, you shouldn't go out
on your own, D.

02:06.666 --> 02:08.276
Kind of like you did
this morning.

02:08.407 --> 02:10.496
And I'm -- And I'm pretty sure
I can handle it.

02:10.626 --> 02:12.237
It could be another one
of Strand's traps.

02:12.367 --> 02:13.586
Okay,
and what if it's not?

02:13.716 --> 02:15.501
What if --
W-What if it breaks

02:15.631 --> 02:18.025
the -- the way Strand's been
talking about it breaking, huh?

02:18.156 --> 02:19.896
Th-Then we need
every soldier we can get.

02:20.027 --> 02:21.550
Can she fight?

02:21.681 --> 02:23.639
Uh, I don't know.
I didn't ask her résumé.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.250
And what is going on
with you?

02:25.380 --> 02:27.034
Nothing.

02:27.165 --> 02:28.905
Just wait for me.

02:29.036 --> 02:30.211
I don't think I can.

02:30.342 --> 02:32.387
And neither can she.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.001
Are you there?

02:38.132 --> 02:39.568
I'm where you said
I should be.

03:03.070 --> 03:04.854
Watch out!

03:13.123 --> 03:14.386
I'm out.

03:14.516 --> 03:17.476
It's radiated.
Don't let him touch you!

03:24.439 --> 03:25.875
Sorry I'm late.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.182
You're just in time.

03:34.971 --> 03:36.756
You okay?

03:36.886 --> 03:38.366
Yeah.

03:40.629 --> 03:41.891
My name's Dwight.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.198
I'm Sherry.

03:44.329 --> 03:45.678
Thank you.

03:45.808 --> 03:46.853
I'm Maya.

03:48.637 --> 03:50.465
Alright.

03:50.596 --> 03:52.162
Well, you're good here,

03:52.293 --> 03:54.382
but you really should wear that
when you're on the move.

03:54.513 --> 03:56.297
And we're gonna need
to get you checked out.

03:56.428 --> 03:58.168
I don't understand.

03:58.299 --> 04:01.171
It's -- It's what I was talking
to you about on the walkie.

04:01.302 --> 04:06.525
The air quality and --
and the, uh...

04:09.658 --> 04:11.094
You're not from around here,
are you?

04:11.225 --> 04:13.096
Not exactly.

04:13.227 --> 04:16.186
I came here on a boat,
looking for my kid.

04:16.317 --> 04:17.536
Well, you landed
in the wrong place.

04:17.666 --> 04:20.234
Wh-- A boat?
What's it like out there?

04:20.365 --> 04:21.757
How far does
the fallout go?

04:21.888 --> 04:23.368
I have no idea.

04:23.498 --> 04:25.108
I was on the boat
for days.

04:25.239 --> 04:26.588
Alright,
let's find your kid, huh?

04:26.719 --> 04:28.155
When was the last time
that you saw him?

04:28.286 --> 04:30.766
A few months ago.

04:30.897 --> 04:34.422
One night, Marco was in our tent
when we went to sleep.

04:34.553 --> 04:36.294
In the morning,
he was gone.

04:38.557 --> 04:39.558
Are you sure it wasn't
the dead?

04:39.688 --> 04:41.864
If it was, how come
they didn't touch me?

04:45.085 --> 04:46.347
You from the Tower?

04:48.262 --> 04:50.395
Well, how do you know
about the Tower?

04:50.525 --> 04:54.399
I heard the message
inviting people to join.

04:54.529 --> 04:56.183
Maybe that's where
they took Marco.

04:56.314 --> 04:59.534
No, y-- trust me, y-you
don't want to go there.

04:59.665 --> 05:01.580
Look, there's bad blood,
okay,

05:01.710 --> 05:03.364
between us
and the man in charge.

05:05.845 --> 05:08.238
But that shouldn't keep you
from going, you know,

05:08.369 --> 05:11.851
especially if you think
your kid's there.

05:11.981 --> 05:15.811
Get your stuff, and I'll point
you in the right direction.

05:15.942 --> 05:17.726
Okay.

05:17.857 --> 05:19.380
Thank you.

05:19.511 --> 05:20.773
Yeah.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.472
What the hell, D?

05:29.390 --> 05:31.305
Hey, honey, honey.
Come on.

05:31.436 --> 05:33.394
Uh, she's better off
with Strand. You know that.

05:33.525 --> 05:35.004
We are about to go to war
with him.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.266
Yeah, I know.

05:39.313 --> 05:40.314
You think
we're gonna lose.

05:40.445 --> 05:43.273
We're outmanned
and outgunned.

05:43.404 --> 05:45.406
It's just us, alright?
We can take that risk.

05:45.537 --> 05:49.018
She's got a kid.
She can't.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.193
Why are you giving me
that look?

05:50.324 --> 05:52.239
I'm not.

05:52.370 --> 05:55.416
I just --
I wish it wasn't like this.

05:57.984 --> 05:59.986
Yeah.

06:00.116 --> 06:01.335
I'm coming in hot.

06:01.466 --> 06:02.858
I'm gonna need a hand-off.

06:02.989 --> 06:04.120
Morgan?
That's Morgan.

06:04.251 --> 06:07.297
I repeat,
I am coming in hot.

06:07.428 --> 06:09.561
Morgan?
Is that you?

06:09.691 --> 06:11.737
Sherry?We're on it.
Where are you?

06:11.867 --> 06:14.000
I'm on the intercoastal road
up a couple of miles

06:14.130 --> 06:15.349
north ofThe Pennsylvania.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.483
Copy.
We'll be there in 10.

06:18.613 --> 06:20.398
W-What do you mean
by hand-off?

06:20.528 --> 06:22.008
Do you need us
to take Mo?

06:22.138 --> 06:23.923
No, it's not Mo.

06:24.053 --> 06:26.099
Some of the walkers
from Strand's moat broke off

06:26.229 --> 06:28.144
and started following me.

06:28.275 --> 06:29.929
I need you to dump 'em
someplace for me.

06:30.059 --> 06:32.627
I only have a couple bags left.

06:34.455 --> 06:37.893
Uh, Dwight and I might not have
enough ammo to take them out.

06:38.024 --> 06:39.329
You definitely do not,

06:39.460 --> 06:40.809
because there are
a lot of them.

06:40.940 --> 06:41.941
How many?

06:44.813 --> 06:45.945
It's all of them.

07:13.538 --> 07:15.365
Luci, you there?

07:17.280 --> 07:18.543
Go for Luciana.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.153
Hey, we need a place to dump
some walkers --

07:20.283 --> 07:21.763
a lot of them.

07:21.894 --> 07:25.071
Where's that, uh, crater
Arno-- Arno's people found?

07:25.201 --> 07:27.160
Five miles west
of the scrapyard.

07:27.290 --> 07:28.553
You need a hand?No, we got it.

07:28.683 --> 07:30.685
I'll let you know
if anything changes.

07:38.911 --> 07:40.608
What's going on, D?

07:41.870 --> 07:44.003
Did I mess up
back there?

07:44.133 --> 07:45.613
What are you
talking about?

07:45.744 --> 07:47.485
With our code --
sending Maya to the Tower.

07:47.615 --> 07:50.400
I mean,
it's the exact opposite

07:50.531 --> 07:52.751
of what you wanted me
to do with Mickey.

07:52.881 --> 07:55.710
Yeah, but Mickey could
hold her own out here, right?

07:58.278 --> 08:01.673
You think we're gonna lose
this fight, don't you?

08:01.803 --> 08:03.936
I don't know.

08:04.066 --> 08:07.461
It's just, everything
we talked about at the gym --

08:07.592 --> 08:08.941
everything that you said
you wanted.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.420
I know, but I'm not
the only one who said that.

08:10.551 --> 08:12.205
You -- You wanted, it, too!I know.

08:12.335 --> 08:14.424
To let life happen,
have a family.

08:14.555 --> 08:16.209
But if we don't
take the Tower,

08:16.339 --> 08:17.906
are we gonna be able
to have any of that?

08:23.608 --> 08:25.784
Okay,
we'll take the Tower.

08:25.914 --> 08:27.786
Well, we're not gonna
be able to do anything

08:27.916 --> 08:30.571
unless we get these walkers
off of Morgan's ass.

08:30.702 --> 08:31.703
Yah!

08:49.198 --> 08:51.505
God, I truly hope you do not
remember any of this

08:51.636 --> 08:54.377
when you get older.

08:54.508 --> 08:57.076
Who am I kidding?

08:57.206 --> 08:59.513
I'll be happy enough if you
just get to be older.

09:07.216 --> 09:08.653
Hey.

09:08.783 --> 09:11.177
You got her back.

09:11.307 --> 09:12.961
Mr. Dorie did.

09:13.092 --> 09:15.573
He gave his life so that
she could escape.

09:22.405 --> 09:25.757
Everybody else
is still in there.

09:25.887 --> 09:29.238
How'd you pick up
so many walkers?

09:29.369 --> 09:30.762
Some of them started
following me

09:30.892 --> 09:33.286
just after Mr. Dorie
handed Mo off.

09:33.416 --> 09:34.635
And then,
I just didn't

09:34.766 --> 09:36.594
discourage the others
from joining.

09:36.724 --> 09:38.073
You wanted them
to follow you?

09:38.204 --> 09:39.684
Yeah.

09:39.814 --> 09:41.250
Strand's felt safe
in that tower

09:41.381 --> 09:43.122
because of the walkers
around it.

09:43.252 --> 09:45.733
But until tonight, when he can
try and draw some more in

09:45.864 --> 09:47.430
with that light
of his --We can get in.

09:47.561 --> 09:50.477
Yeah.You're good.

09:50.608 --> 09:54.437
Well, let's, uh -- let's dump
'em all before we say that.

09:54.568 --> 09:56.048
No, it'll work.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.527
There's already walkers
in that crater.

09:57.658 --> 09:58.485
What's a thousand more?

09:58.616 --> 09:59.878
Get Mo back to the sub.

10:00.008 --> 10:01.053
Daniel and Luci,
they'll be ready.

10:14.849 --> 10:17.025
Those are
Strand's rangers.

10:17.156 --> 10:19.549
Are they crazy?He's desperate.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.726
He knows that the only reason
we didn't make a move

10:21.856 --> 10:23.292
on the Tower
was because of Mo.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.164
Uh, well...

10:27.035 --> 10:28.558
They're gonna
get themselves killed.

10:28.689 --> 10:30.517
Those walkers get dispersed,
it's gonna make it easier

10:30.648 --> 10:32.693
for Strand to draw them
back tonight.

10:32.824 --> 10:34.260
We've gotta
keep them together.

10:34.390 --> 10:36.131
Give me your gun.

10:36.262 --> 10:37.524
What?
What are you talking about?

10:37.655 --> 10:38.743
Yeah, come here
and take her.

10:41.093 --> 10:44.009
You can get her further away
than I can, and faster.

10:44.139 --> 10:46.489
So you get her to the sub,
you lock the hatches.

10:46.620 --> 10:48.491
The one thing
we gotta do --

10:48.622 --> 10:49.667
we gotta keep her away
from Strand.

10:49.797 --> 10:51.277
She should be
with her dad.

10:51.407 --> 10:54.193
She should be with whoever
can keep her safe right now.

11:01.504 --> 11:02.897
This could be
a good thing.

11:03.028 --> 11:04.333
Well, if we can do it
with her,

11:04.464 --> 11:05.508
we can do it
with one of our own.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.425
Yeah, uh, I don't think
they're reading

11:09.556 --> 11:10.731
the same tea leaves
as you.

11:10.862 --> 11:12.515
Come on!

11:20.219 --> 11:21.350
Hyah!

11:23.309 --> 11:24.527
Hey!

11:24.658 --> 11:26.181
Hey, stay on me!

11:29.532 --> 11:31.404
That's right!
Come on!

11:31.534 --> 11:32.797
On me!

11:39.064 --> 11:40.326
Keep coming!

11:53.339 --> 11:56.385
It's all right.
I think we lost 'em.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.953
How is she?

11:59.084 --> 12:00.738
I think she likes it.

12:03.610 --> 12:05.003
D. D.

12:07.440 --> 12:08.484
Whoa.

12:08.615 --> 12:10.138
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

12:10.269 --> 12:11.879
Alright, I'm, uh --
I'm afraid we're gonna have

12:12.010 --> 12:13.576
to ask you
to get out of our way.

12:13.707 --> 12:15.796
Or what?
You won't kill me.

12:15.927 --> 12:17.406
You got a code.

12:18.799 --> 12:20.148
What do you know
about our code?

12:27.939 --> 12:29.897
A lot.

12:30.028 --> 12:33.118
We'll shoot.I don't think you will.

12:33.248 --> 12:37.035
But, if you do,
the rest of the rangers

12:37.165 --> 12:38.645
will be on you
like that.

12:38.776 --> 12:40.734
Do you really care about
protecting Strand?

12:40.865 --> 12:42.692
No, I care about
surviving.

12:42.823 --> 12:44.042
And that Tower's the only way
I'll do it.

12:44.172 --> 12:46.609
Well, why don't you
come with us.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.481
You help us
take down the Tower,

12:48.611 --> 12:50.309
we'll pretend like
you never even left.

12:52.398 --> 12:53.660
Give me the kid.

12:56.968 --> 12:58.447
I was
just like you once.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.885
Give...me...the...kid.

13:01.015 --> 13:03.061
Trying to be
someone's right-hand man,

13:03.191 --> 13:05.759
doing what you needed to do
to protect your own.

13:05.890 --> 13:07.413
I get it.

13:07.543 --> 13:09.502
You think I'm doing this
'cause I'm on a power trip?

13:09.632 --> 13:10.982
Well --No, I'm doing this because

13:11.112 --> 13:13.027
you all made me believe
in something better.

13:15.073 --> 13:17.466
I killed my brother
because of it.

13:17.597 --> 13:18.685
It turns out you all
don't even believe

13:18.816 --> 13:20.992
in the bullshit
you preach.

13:21.122 --> 13:24.517
I should've just gone along
with Derek when I found him.

13:24.647 --> 13:26.084
At least he was honest
about what he was doing.

13:26.214 --> 13:28.869
You want honesty?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.262
This is
your last warning.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.699
The hell's that
supposed to mean?

13:37.486 --> 13:39.227
Ugh!

13:47.148 --> 13:48.628
If you really thought
building something better

13:48.758 --> 13:50.064
was bullshit,

13:50.195 --> 13:51.718
you would have shot us.

13:51.849 --> 13:53.938
While you're sitting there
by your lonesome,

13:54.068 --> 13:56.331
waiting for your cavalry
to come,

13:56.462 --> 13:58.420
take a minute
and think about what I said.

14:45.119 --> 14:46.294
Morgan!

14:46.425 --> 14:48.253
I'm sorry.

14:48.383 --> 14:50.603
What the --
I'm sorry,
but we gotta get out of here.

14:50.733 --> 14:52.431
Strand's rangers
must be close by.

14:52.561 --> 14:55.303
That was me.

14:55.434 --> 14:56.522
What? Why?

14:56.652 --> 14:58.089
To keep them from
tearing you apart?

14:58.219 --> 15:00.265
No, no, I need them
to keep following me.

15:00.395 --> 15:01.570
Hey!

15:01.701 --> 15:03.355
Hey!

15:03.485 --> 15:05.923
Over here!

15:06.053 --> 15:07.663
That is Strand's moat.

15:07.794 --> 15:10.405
We gotta ditch them someplace
so that he can't use 'em.

15:10.536 --> 15:11.929
Hey! Keep coming!

15:13.669 --> 15:15.236
Over here!

15:17.108 --> 15:19.719
W-Where did
you come from?

15:19.849 --> 15:22.200
When did
you get back?

15:24.898 --> 15:26.508
Sorry.

15:28.771 --> 15:29.772
How you feeling?

15:32.166 --> 15:34.038
I'm still standing.

15:34.168 --> 15:35.387
Find what you were
looking for?

15:35.517 --> 15:36.692
I found the transmitter.

15:36.823 --> 15:37.911
And then I heard
Strand's message,

15:38.042 --> 15:39.434
I came as soon
as I could.

15:39.565 --> 15:42.437
But you didn't see
anybody else out there?

15:42.568 --> 15:44.439
Not yet.

15:44.570 --> 15:47.225
You didn't find that girl,
did you?

15:47.355 --> 15:48.922
What, the one you told me
helped you on the sub?

15:49.053 --> 15:50.271
No, I did not.

15:50.402 --> 15:52.360
I got Mo out, though.

15:52.491 --> 15:55.015
Got these dead to follow me
at the same time.

15:57.713 --> 15:59.454
That's why we're gonna
make our move.

15:59.585 --> 16:00.890
I told you to wait
for me.

16:01.021 --> 16:02.457
We didn't know
where you were.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.677
Well, I need to get back
to the sub.

16:04.807 --> 16:06.070
I need the generators
to power this.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.897
We don't have time
for that.

16:08.028 --> 16:09.943
The Tower's unguarded,
at least until dark.

16:10.074 --> 16:12.990
We only get one shot at this,
and we're not ready.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.166
Luciana brought in
Arno's people.

16:15.296 --> 16:17.516
Yours, the rest of ours,
and them, that's enough.

16:17.646 --> 16:19.605
It's not.
It's not even close.

16:19.735 --> 16:22.347
But we can get more.

16:22.477 --> 16:25.306
Can't keep waiting.
I had to make a call.

16:25.437 --> 16:26.829
You're more that welcome
to join us,

16:26.960 --> 16:28.483
but I understand
if you don't want to.

16:28.614 --> 16:30.224
Hey! That's it!

16:30.355 --> 16:31.878
Keep coming!

16:36.013 --> 16:38.406
You followed
a walker for me.

16:38.537 --> 16:41.148
The least I can do is get
these walkers to follow you.

16:42.758 --> 16:45.544
Thank you.

16:45.674 --> 16:47.285
Keep coming!

16:58.035 --> 16:59.906
Anything from Luci?

17:00.037 --> 17:02.735
Nothing.

17:02.865 --> 17:05.042
You know, Strand's rangers
would have passed us by now

17:05.172 --> 17:06.739
if they were
tracking us.

17:06.869 --> 17:09.089
Well, we don't move until
we make contact with her.

17:23.799 --> 17:25.540
What the hell is that?

17:25.671 --> 17:30.328
Oh, I -- Well, I --
I call it an auto-mobile.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.160
Jesus.

17:36.290 --> 17:37.552
What?
She likes it.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.380
I'm trying to keep us
alive here.

17:39.511 --> 17:41.730
And I'm trying to show her
a reason to stay alive.

17:43.689 --> 17:46.387
Wha-- What is
going on with you?Nothing.

17:46.518 --> 17:48.650
Come on.
No, it's not --
it's not important.

17:48.781 --> 17:51.218
Well, every time you say that,
it's really important.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.136
It's just hard for me
to see you with her like this.

17:56.267 --> 17:59.183
Like what?I don't know, like...

17:59.313 --> 18:02.099
laughing and smiling
and making dad jokes.

18:02.229 --> 18:03.491
Why?

18:03.622 --> 18:06.538
Because, D,
we're not gonna have that.

18:10.324 --> 18:12.674
You don't know that.Oh, come on.

18:12.805 --> 18:16.896
You were right. I-I know
what we're up against, so --Okay. Well, you just want
to give up?

18:17.026 --> 18:18.376
You gonna throw in
with Strand, or --No, it's not -- not
what I'm saying.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.204
I-It's just not easy.

18:20.334 --> 18:22.249
Sherry.

18:24.512 --> 18:28.081
Luci, open the hatch and
prepare to lock down the sub.

18:28.212 --> 18:30.083
We're on our way,
and chances are,
we're not alone.

18:30.214 --> 18:31.519
Negative.
Don't come.

18:31.650 --> 18:33.391
I repeat, don't come to
The Pennsylvania!

18:33.521 --> 18:35.393
Whoa, w-why not?
What's going on?

18:35.523 --> 18:38.222
The engineering compartment
is starting to leak radiation.

18:38.352 --> 18:40.267
We're in the middle
of an evacuation.

18:41.312 --> 18:42.400
Shit!

18:42.530 --> 18:44.097
Alright, look,
we'll -- we'll wait here

18:44.228 --> 18:45.185
and we'll wait it out.

18:45.316 --> 18:46.795
No, we can't.
We can't.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.493
I mean, they were probably
just listening,

18:48.623 --> 18:50.756
a-and they know which direction
we're coming from.

18:50.886 --> 18:52.410
They'll find us.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.412
Look, we keep moving.Alright.

18:54.542 --> 18:57.110
Alright, then,
let's move.
Okay.

18:57.241 --> 18:58.459
Wait.
Look, D, I'll take that.

18:58.590 --> 19:00.069
Give me --
No, I got it.
You get her.

19:00.200 --> 19:00.983
No, give me -- No.
It's mine.
Why? Why?

19:01.114 --> 19:02.246
What's in there?
Nothing.

19:02.376 --> 19:03.769
Okay, well,
let me see it!
Wait!

19:14.954 --> 19:16.651
Navigation charts.

19:16.782 --> 19:17.957
What the hell
are these?

19:22.396 --> 19:24.659
Where were you
this morning?

19:24.790 --> 19:26.226
I was getting the,
uh...

19:28.489 --> 19:32.276
...emergency raft from the sub
ready to launch.

19:32.406 --> 19:34.800
Alright, so,
you're just gonna --

19:34.930 --> 19:36.193
you're just gonna leave,
after all this?

19:36.323 --> 19:37.716
No.

19:37.846 --> 19:40.197
D, the raft
wasn't for me.

19:40.327 --> 19:41.937
It was for you.

19:42.068 --> 19:43.635
Yeah, w-w-well...

19:43.765 --> 19:45.550
Okay, uh...

19:45.680 --> 19:48.944
What -- W-W-What are you
talking about?
Come on, D.

19:49.075 --> 19:51.382
We know what's coming.

19:51.512 --> 19:53.079
We heard the offer
that Strand made.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.472
Okay, what does that
have to do with me?

19:54.602 --> 19:55.951
I don't want you
to turn into

19:56.082 --> 19:57.649
the person that
you don't want to be.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.651
We've been over this before,
okay?!

19:59.781 --> 20:01.261
It's not gonna happen!

20:06.223 --> 20:07.659
Look, I...

20:21.890 --> 20:23.762
You actually think
I'd throw in with Strand?

20:23.892 --> 20:27.374
Don't you?
Well, it ha--
it happened before.

20:27.505 --> 20:28.941
I just don't want it
to happen again.

20:29.071 --> 20:32.901
That's bullshit.
And you know it.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.729
I'll tell you
what's bullshit --

20:34.860 --> 20:36.514
Thinking you could stay
ahead of us.

20:36.644 --> 20:38.211
And if you're thinking
about runnin',

20:38.342 --> 20:40.344
I've got half-a-dozen
more rangers on their way.

20:40.474 --> 20:44.130
Just hand her over.

20:44.261 --> 20:45.740
What do we get
if we hand her over?

20:45.871 --> 20:47.916
D!
No, if you think this
is how we're gonna end up,

20:48.047 --> 20:50.092
we might as well
get something out of it.

20:52.617 --> 20:53.966
If we hand her over,
can we still

20:54.096 --> 20:55.750
take you up
on Strand's deal?

20:55.881 --> 20:57.535
That's not
my call to make.

20:57.665 --> 21:00.189
But I'm sure
it'll help your case.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.496
Dwight.
What are you doing?I'm not --
I'm not gonna --

21:02.627 --> 21:04.150
I'm not gonna try
and be a better person

21:04.281 --> 21:05.804
if you don't
even think I can.

21:05.934 --> 21:06.979
Pick her up.

21:13.246 --> 21:14.508
Alright.

21:20.384 --> 21:22.255
It's okay.
It's all right.

21:39.881 --> 21:41.274
Honey, go!

21:41.405 --> 21:42.144
Go, go, go!

21:44.233 --> 21:45.800
D!

21:45.931 --> 21:47.106
Honey, go!

21:47.236 --> 21:48.325
Go!

22:22.184 --> 22:24.578
You never did answer me,
really, back there.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.365
Tell me how
you're feeling.

22:33.413 --> 22:34.675
Fever's still
coming back at night,

22:34.806 --> 22:36.024
just like before.

22:38.505 --> 22:41.552
But the dreams
are getting worse.

22:41.682 --> 22:43.249
What do you mean
by "worse"?

22:46.252 --> 22:48.515
I don't know, like they're
getting more and more real.

22:48.646 --> 22:52.258
Like I...can't run
from them anymore.

22:56.001 --> 22:59.439
You know the last time it
was just you and me? Remember?

22:59.570 --> 23:01.920
We were following
one of those things.

23:02.050 --> 23:03.965
You know the Senator.
He's probably in
there somewhere.

23:04.096 --> 23:06.315
Well, if you want to go
find him, you can be my guest.

23:08.579 --> 23:10.102
Where are
you taking them?

23:10.232 --> 23:11.973
Dwight and Sherry said
there's a crater

23:12.104 --> 23:14.454
that's got a bunch of them
already trapped in it, so...

23:17.283 --> 23:18.240
Strand's gonna come
after you hard

23:18.371 --> 23:19.807
for doing this
to the Tower.

23:19.938 --> 23:23.463
Yeah, he already is.
Which is why we gotta move now.

23:28.860 --> 23:32.298
Morgan,
we're not...ready.

23:32.429 --> 23:35.170
We don't have a choice.

23:35.301 --> 23:37.390
Grace recorded some songs
for Mo to listen to

23:37.521 --> 23:39.523
when they escaped,
and she left something for me.

23:39.653 --> 23:41.307
Morgan, listen,

23:41.438 --> 23:43.048
we don't have much time.

23:43.178 --> 23:44.919
If this works,
I need you to take Mo

23:45.050 --> 23:47.400
and get away from here,
as far away from Strand

23:47.531 --> 23:49.881
and this Tower
as humanly possible,

23:50.011 --> 23:53.145
even if it means
leaving without me.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.800
She's right.

23:55.930 --> 23:58.629
It's the only way to make sure
that Mo is safe.

23:58.759 --> 24:00.282
So if we don't get
that Tower tonight --

24:00.413 --> 24:02.546
You're gonna do it.

24:02.676 --> 24:04.722
You're gonna take her
away from here.

24:04.852 --> 24:07.768
If I can even find
a way out of here, yes, I am.

24:07.899 --> 24:09.596
And I don't want
to leave.

24:09.727 --> 24:12.556
Not when we're barely
hanging on.

24:12.686 --> 24:15.384
I left some folks I cared about
once before,

24:15.515 --> 24:19.345
and it has never
sat right with me.

24:19.476 --> 24:21.129
I gotta take care of Mo.

24:23.828 --> 24:25.394
And if you can take
the Tower tonight,

24:25.525 --> 24:26.657
you won't have
to go anywhere?

24:26.787 --> 24:28.441
It's more vulnerable
than it's ever been.

24:31.444 --> 24:34.186
Still, we're not ready.Why? Why not?

24:34.316 --> 24:36.014
We're outnumbered.

24:36.144 --> 24:38.146
Ill-prepared, tired,
hungry, sick --

24:38.277 --> 24:40.322
And that's never
stopped us before, so...

24:43.021 --> 24:44.239
Why are you stalling?

24:44.370 --> 24:45.632
I'm not stalling.

24:45.763 --> 24:47.025
You've been away
for all this time,

24:47.155 --> 24:48.766
and you got nothing
to show for it?

24:48.896 --> 24:50.202
You're stalling.Why would I be stalling?

24:50.332 --> 24:51.551
I don't know.
I don't know.

24:51.682 --> 24:52.552
It's just,
you keep saying

24:52.683 --> 24:54.685
how little time
you have left.

25:04.651 --> 25:08.481
D? Is that you?

25:08.612 --> 25:11.223
There you are.

25:11.353 --> 25:12.746
Why'd you stop?

25:14.182 --> 25:16.271
Aside from the change?

25:16.402 --> 25:18.012
Where's Wes?

25:18.143 --> 25:20.928
Oh, he's still out there.
I just slowed him down.

25:21.059 --> 25:23.191
We're good for here,
but we can't go any further.

25:25.280 --> 25:27.718
We still have half-a-dozen
rangers riding up behind us.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.721
How's she doing?

25:30.851 --> 25:33.027
She has no idea.
Ah.

25:34.202 --> 25:35.639
It's okay.

25:37.292 --> 25:38.293
Alright.

25:41.862 --> 25:45.170
Mm, okay.
Ready?

25:45.300 --> 25:46.780
It's okay.

25:54.962 --> 25:58.313
I'm sorry for
what I said earlier.

25:58.444 --> 26:00.185
I don't think that
you would take Strand's deal

26:00.315 --> 26:01.665
for yourself.

26:01.795 --> 26:03.014
But you still think
I'd take it? For who?

26:03.144 --> 26:05.451
You?
It's complicated.

26:05.582 --> 26:08.019
Why don't you just tell me
what's going on, huh?

26:08.149 --> 26:10.195
D...

26:10.325 --> 26:11.718
Look.

26:15.156 --> 26:17.419
The Franklin.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.296
Hey, does anybody know where
that bunker is --

26:24.426 --> 26:27.168
Uh, the one Teddy
locked up Alicia in?

26:27.299 --> 26:29.301
I might be able to answer that.

26:29.431 --> 26:31.259
Alicia, is that you?

26:31.390 --> 26:33.131
Yeah,
I'm here with Morgan.

26:33.261 --> 26:37.091
The bunker is underneath
the Franklin Hotel. Why?

26:37.222 --> 26:39.572
I think
we just found it.

26:39.703 --> 26:42.009
What if we hide
in there?

26:42.140 --> 26:45.099
No. Al-Alicia,
is there another way out?

26:45.230 --> 26:47.319
Just the drainage works
on the north end,

26:47.449 --> 26:49.887
but they're not stable.

26:50.017 --> 26:51.628
Dwight, come on.

26:54.848 --> 26:56.937
Hey, the rangers
might have heard that.

26:57.068 --> 26:58.330
Look, we'd be cornered
if they came in.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.766
We should go through
the crater.

26:59.897 --> 27:00.811
That way, we can stay
ahead of them.

27:00.941 --> 27:02.769
Th-The readings,
they're way too high.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.379
I know.
We -- We have our gas masks.

27:04.510 --> 27:06.120
We'll be protected,
and Morgan said

27:06.251 --> 27:07.382
that thing's
lined with lead.

27:07.513 --> 27:09.602
Well, hers might be,
but ours aren't.

27:09.733 --> 27:11.343
Okay, then she'll be
protected. That's all
that matters right now.

27:11.473 --> 27:13.693
It's -- It's not.What are you
talking about, huh?

27:13.824 --> 27:15.608
I -- I'm just --F-F-First, you think

27:15.739 --> 27:17.741
I-I'm gonna bail,
and -- a-and now,

27:17.871 --> 27:19.525
you won't even
do what we need to do

27:19.656 --> 27:22.397
to keep her safe!

27:22.528 --> 27:24.138
Why don't you just
give her to me? I'll go.Please, D.

27:24.269 --> 27:25.357
Please?
Here, I got her.

27:25.487 --> 27:27.751
D. D!
What?

27:27.881 --> 27:29.361
I think I might be
pregnant.

27:33.800 --> 27:35.410
Are you serious?

27:35.541 --> 27:37.064
Uh...

27:37.195 --> 27:39.414
Yeah.
I think so.

27:39.545 --> 27:41.155
Okay.

27:41.286 --> 27:43.418
Hey.

27:43.549 --> 27:44.506
That's a good thing.

27:45.812 --> 27:47.945
It is?
It is.

27:48.075 --> 27:50.687
That's a g-- Y-Yeah,
that's a good thing.

27:54.429 --> 27:56.127
Okay, go.
Alright.

27:56.257 --> 27:56.867
Go.

28:08.443 --> 28:11.925
Easy. Easy.
The whole system shorted.

28:12.056 --> 28:14.319
Hmm.

28:14.449 --> 28:16.190
The bench -- there.

28:16.321 --> 28:17.844
Alright, okay, I got it.
I got it.

28:20.891 --> 28:22.457
Mo. Okay.

28:30.814 --> 28:32.946
I'm sorry, D.

28:33.077 --> 28:35.296
I should have told you
earlier.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.344
H-How long do you think
it's been?

28:39.474 --> 28:42.608
A couple weeks?

28:42.739 --> 28:45.263
Okay, well, we'll --
we'll find you a test, and --

28:45.393 --> 28:46.743
I already took a test.

28:48.179 --> 28:50.398
And?

28:50.529 --> 28:52.618
I haven't
looked at it yet.

28:52.749 --> 28:55.012
Let me...

28:55.142 --> 28:56.056
Here.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.407
Hey.

29:00.931 --> 29:03.847
That's why I didn't want
you going through my bag.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.242
What do you mean,
you haven't looked at it yet?

29:08.373 --> 29:12.464
Because I know you, D.

29:12.594 --> 29:14.683
If -- If this
is positive,

29:14.814 --> 29:16.990
you're gonna want to do
what's best for her,

29:17.121 --> 29:21.473
even if that means
going into Strand's Tower.

29:21.603 --> 29:24.650
You know,
if we do that,

29:24.781 --> 29:27.827
if we go into
that place,

29:27.958 --> 29:31.831
it will destroy all the parts
of you that I love.

29:31.962 --> 29:32.876
You know,
all the -- the parts

29:33.006 --> 29:36.270
that are gonna make you
a great father.

29:36.401 --> 29:39.404
And I just -- I can't let
that happen to you again.

29:42.015 --> 29:44.713
You know, I want our child
to know you.

29:47.455 --> 29:50.502
Not the person that
Strand would turn you into.

29:50.632 --> 29:53.766
Look, I love you for trying
to protect me, honey.

29:53.897 --> 29:57.291
I-I really do. But I should
be able to protect you too.

29:57.422 --> 30:00.468
Which means you don't get
to do this alone,

30:00.599 --> 30:02.514
especially when
we're in this together.

30:03.776 --> 30:05.734
Yeah?

30:08.694 --> 30:10.261
Let's take a look.

30:18.922 --> 30:20.488
It's the rangers.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.012
Let's move.

30:30.803 --> 30:32.936
I thought you said the crater
was filled with walkers.

30:33.066 --> 30:36.330
Well, that's what
Dwight and Sherry said.

30:43.076 --> 30:44.904
Somebody let 'em out.

30:49.866 --> 30:51.041
Well, if we dump them
in here,

30:51.171 --> 30:52.129
they're just gonna
climb right out.

30:52.259 --> 30:53.391
Yeah.

30:53.521 --> 30:56.133
Dwight, Sherry,
crater's a no-go.

30:56.263 --> 30:58.048
We're looking for
another place to dump 'em.

31:03.836 --> 31:07.709
I repeat -- We need to find
another place to dump 'em.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.363
What'd he --
What'd he say?

31:09.494 --> 31:12.366
They're still looking for
a place to dump the walkers.

31:12.497 --> 31:15.717
They don't dump 'em,
we can't move on the Tower.

31:15.848 --> 31:17.284
Let's keep moving.

31:29.993 --> 31:31.385
Can you clear it?

31:31.516 --> 31:33.518
Yeah, I think so.

31:36.913 --> 31:38.088
Hey, D.

31:38.218 --> 31:39.524
How loud do you think
the fire alarm is

31:39.654 --> 31:40.525
in a place like this?

31:40.655 --> 31:42.266
Pretty loud.
Why?

31:42.396 --> 31:44.442
Well, you think they could
hear it from up there?

31:44.572 --> 31:46.270
Uh, I mean,
a-above ground?

31:46.400 --> 31:49.142
Maybe.

31:49.273 --> 31:51.405
If Morgan and Alicia
are heading back...

31:51.536 --> 31:53.364
They'll be walking
right over us.

31:57.672 --> 31:58.543
Get diggin'.

32:00.197 --> 32:01.328
Their horses were
right outside.

32:01.459 --> 32:04.462
They have to be
down here.

32:05.767 --> 32:07.030
What the hell?

32:07.160 --> 32:09.032
Find it.

32:09.162 --> 32:11.382
Turn it off!

32:20.304 --> 32:22.480
What is that?
Do you hear that?

32:22.610 --> 32:24.047
Bunker.

32:24.177 --> 32:26.223
We're on top of it.

32:26.353 --> 32:28.573
Dwight and Sherry must have
tripped the alarms.

32:31.097 --> 32:32.881
The door.
We get 'em in there.

32:33.012 --> 32:35.580
With Dwight and Sherry
down there with Mo?

32:35.710 --> 32:38.583
They'll get her out.
I got a plan.

32:38.713 --> 32:40.063
Trust me.

32:49.289 --> 32:51.683
Hey, it's okay. Hi.

32:54.120 --> 32:56.731
O-Okay.
It's okay.

33:08.178 --> 33:09.744
Son of a bitch.

33:09.875 --> 33:10.832
D?

33:10.963 --> 33:12.704
The walkers
are above us.

33:15.011 --> 33:16.969
Come on,
keep coming.

33:17.100 --> 33:19.537
Keep coming.

33:19.667 --> 33:22.888
Hey, have you made it
to the tunnel yet?

33:23.019 --> 33:25.108
I repeat -- Have you
reached the tunnel?

33:25.238 --> 33:27.153
The signal won't reach
down there.

33:29.199 --> 33:30.504
Yeah.

33:30.635 --> 33:31.940
Right.

33:32.071 --> 33:33.420
We get them in,
and then we go

33:33.551 --> 33:34.639
to where
the pipe lets out.

33:36.597 --> 33:37.337
Okay.

33:37.468 --> 33:39.731
Over here!
Let's go!

33:39.861 --> 33:41.559
Come on!
Come on!

33:41.689 --> 33:43.430
Hey,
over here!

33:43.561 --> 33:44.562
Keep coming!

33:52.613 --> 33:55.138
Come on!
Come on, pull the power!

33:55.268 --> 33:56.704
Come on!

33:58.445 --> 33:59.490
Hey! Hey!

34:20.946 --> 34:24.341
Agh!

34:24.471 --> 34:25.733
You okay?
Yeah.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.039
Is she?

34:27.170 --> 34:28.823
Yeah, we're all right.

35:11.518 --> 35:14.739
I think we're,
uh, stuck.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.151
I'm sorry.

35:37.327 --> 35:38.850
I really am.

35:38.980 --> 35:40.373
It's not your fault.

35:44.508 --> 35:46.162
Hey.

35:52.559 --> 35:53.821
I'm sorry too.

35:57.347 --> 36:00.045
We tried everything.

36:00.176 --> 36:01.960
I promise, we did.

36:16.366 --> 36:17.802
Maybe I'm just not,
uh...

36:26.767 --> 36:29.161
Just -- Maybe it just
wasn't meant to be.

36:29.292 --> 36:30.597
You know?

37:01.802 --> 37:04.327
You really...

37:04.457 --> 37:06.981
You really wanna do that
right now?
Yeah.

37:07.112 --> 37:08.418
I need to.

37:10.898 --> 37:12.030
You were right.

37:15.294 --> 37:19.080
This isn't something
I should have done on my own.

37:21.648 --> 37:23.563
This is something
I should have done with you.

37:28.133 --> 37:29.526
Okay.

37:37.229 --> 37:39.057
Wanna help me?

37:52.592 --> 37:53.593
Come on.

38:02.036 --> 38:03.560
Come on.
Oh.

38:13.613 --> 38:16.703
Okay.

38:16.834 --> 38:18.270
Alright,
it's -- it's not g--

38:18.401 --> 38:19.706
it's not gonna end
like this.

38:21.969 --> 38:23.101
We're gonna
get out of here.

38:23.231 --> 38:24.102
How?

38:26.887 --> 38:28.280
The same way as before.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.658
Should they not
be out already?

38:58.789 --> 39:00.486
Give them some time!

39:05.970 --> 39:08.668
Maybe you should go to the sub,
get everybody ready.

39:08.799 --> 39:11.062
Only got a few more hours
of daylight.

39:16.763 --> 39:18.025
You were right.

39:19.984 --> 39:22.334
Right?
Right about what?

39:22.465 --> 39:24.075
I could have
come back sooner.

39:26.817 --> 39:29.689
Then why didn't you?

39:29.820 --> 39:31.256
Because I know what
I might have to do to Strand,

39:31.387 --> 39:32.866
and I'm not sure I can.

39:32.997 --> 39:35.260
You will do the right thing
when the time comes.

39:35.391 --> 39:37.218
How do you know that?Oh, come on.

39:37.349 --> 39:38.698
You've already done
the impossible.

39:38.829 --> 39:41.005
You're still here.

39:41.135 --> 39:44.138
It's not over for you.

39:44.269 --> 39:45.879
Not by a long shot.

39:50.710 --> 39:53.147
Hear that?

39:53.278 --> 39:54.018
Mo?

39:54.148 --> 39:56.412
Hey, Mo!

39:57.761 --> 39:59.110
She's there.You okay?

39:59.240 --> 40:00.720
Yeah, she's there.
Here.

40:06.552 --> 40:08.032
- You all right?- Yeah.

40:08.162 --> 40:11.035
I got it.

40:11.165 --> 40:12.645
Hey, hey, hey.

40:15.996 --> 40:17.041
Okay.

40:23.047 --> 40:25.528
That's right, baby.
I'm right here.

40:25.658 --> 40:28.139
The tunnel,
it collapsed.

40:28.269 --> 40:29.183
How'd you clear it?

40:29.314 --> 40:31.272
I-I didn't.

40:31.403 --> 40:32.839
She did.

40:39.411 --> 40:42.022
Thanks for
the assist.

40:42.153 --> 40:44.198
Come on.

40:44.329 --> 40:45.896
That's it.

40:46.026 --> 40:48.420
There she is.

40:48.551 --> 40:49.856
You should keep it.

40:53.469 --> 40:56.210
Look, if we could get on the sub
and use the transmitter,

40:56.341 --> 40:57.777
there might be a way
we could reach

40:57.908 --> 40:59.170
whoever's left out there
and make a real push

40:59.300 --> 41:01.215
for the Tower.The sub's a no-go.

41:01.346 --> 41:02.739
It's leaking
radiation.

41:02.869 --> 41:04.349
-You're kidding me.
-No.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.351
That woman --
that mom --

41:06.482 --> 41:09.920
she said she heard
Strand's message all
the way from the water.

41:10.050 --> 41:14.751
Right, and that must have been,
what, 20 miles out?

41:14.881 --> 41:16.622
Which -- Yeah, I mean,
which means

41:16.753 --> 41:19.103
Strand's gotta have an antenna
for that type of range.

41:19.233 --> 41:21.540
So the Tower -- I could use
the transmitter from there.

41:21.671 --> 41:22.976
Strand's got power,

41:23.107 --> 41:24.369
and it's the highest point
for miles around.

41:24.500 --> 41:27.198
And with
the ULF's range...

41:27.328 --> 41:29.461
One more reason
to take it from him.

41:29.592 --> 41:32.377
It's another reason
for youto take it.

41:32.508 --> 41:34.684
I gotta do it, Alicia --
what Grace asked me to do --

41:34.814 --> 41:37.425
and get Mo as far away
from here as possible.

41:37.556 --> 41:38.514
But where are you gonna
take her?

41:38.644 --> 41:40.080
I mean,
there's no way out.

41:40.211 --> 41:41.517
I know a way.

41:44.998 --> 41:48.045
Grace said the weather patterns
might have been affected --

41:48.175 --> 41:51.918
that the fallout could hug
the coast for hundreds of miles.

41:52.049 --> 41:54.355
But that woman
that we sent to Strand --

41:54.486 --> 41:56.053
she came from
someplace clean.

41:56.183 --> 41:58.272
And what if
I can't find it?

41:58.403 --> 42:01.188
Take her out, drive around
the block a few times.

42:08.326 --> 42:11.111
I can't do this.

42:11.242 --> 42:13.592
I can't walk away just as
you're about to face him.

42:16.334 --> 42:17.770
You have to.

42:19.772 --> 42:22.993
For her.
For Grace.

42:23.123 --> 42:24.821
For yourself.

42:29.216 --> 42:31.784
Look, we're both doing
something we don't want to do.

42:35.005 --> 42:36.702
But you're right,
you know?

42:40.750 --> 42:44.101
I'm gonna be okay.

42:44.231 --> 42:45.711
I cando this.

42:48.540 --> 42:50.020
You're gonna
see me again.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.853
Now go.

42:56.983 --> 42:58.332
Yeah.

43:03.381 --> 43:04.382
I got this.

43:10.214 --> 43:12.433
I should take her.

43:12.564 --> 43:14.871
She's sleeping
like a...

43:18.352 --> 43:19.658
Thanks.

43:23.140 --> 43:24.881
You know, you could get
on there, too.

43:25.011 --> 43:26.839
No.

43:26.970 --> 43:29.581
D, Strand doesn't know.

43:29.712 --> 43:31.888
He can't use this
against us.

43:32.018 --> 43:34.760
But -- But we can
use it against him.

43:34.891 --> 43:38.895
Because now, we have
something to fight for.

43:39.025 --> 43:40.461
Okay.

43:43.595 --> 43:46.424
Ohhh, there you go, baby.

43:46.554 --> 43:47.817
There you go.

43:53.605 --> 43:56.086
Thank you.

43:56.216 --> 43:57.914
Oh, hang on.

44:00.307 --> 44:04.050
So it smells good and, well,
it's live entertainment.

44:10.796 --> 44:12.189
Appreciate it.

44:14.321 --> 44:16.106
Both of you.

44:20.893 --> 44:21.938
Alright, so, uh...

44:26.464 --> 44:27.900
Good luck, right?

44:32.818 --> 44:33.863
Okay.

45:01.455 --> 45:03.762
We gotta move!

45:03.893 --> 45:05.677
The sun sets
in a few hours!

45:07.723 --> 45:09.246
Follow me!

45:42.583 --> 45:43.715
She didn't come alone.

45:43.846 --> 45:45.804
The gang's all here.

45:45.935 --> 45:47.588
To new beginnings.

45:47.719 --> 45:50.026
We have very different ideas
of what that means.

45:54.117 --> 45:56.510
She should've been out
by now.

46:01.080 --> 46:02.821
What the hell
is going on up there?

46:04.562 --> 46:06.651
It's over.

46:06.782 --> 46:08.392
No!

46:21.057 --> 46:23.102
Hey, honey,
where the hell are you?

46:23.233 --> 46:24.234
Hey, what is it, D?

46:24.364 --> 46:25.713
We got an SOS.

46:25.844 --> 46:27.193
On the Dark Horse channel?

46:27.324 --> 46:30.414
Yes. Yeah, some lady
got herself turned around

46:30.544 --> 46:31.807
down near the inlet.

46:31.937 --> 46:33.330
I'll meet you at the sub.

46:33.460 --> 46:35.680
We see
the Dark Horses riding again,

46:35.811 --> 46:38.291
and Dwight and Sherry
end up arriving

46:38.422 --> 46:40.641
just in the nick of time,
and they save Maya

46:40.772 --> 46:42.078
from some Walker trouble.

46:44.471 --> 46:48.127
And then we see something kind
of very unexpected from Dwight.

46:48.258 --> 46:50.869
He suggests that Maya goes
to the Tower.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.088
Get your stuff
and I'll point you

46:52.218 --> 46:53.567
in the right direction.

46:53.698 --> 46:56.135
This is something that really
throws Sherry off

46:56.266 --> 46:59.965
because she knows that Dwight,
along with Morgan and everyone

47:00.096 --> 47:02.838
on the submarine, is planning to
launch and attack on the Tower.

47:02.968 --> 47:05.231
So it's just not quite
adding up.

47:05.362 --> 47:07.190
Why are you giving me
that look?

47:07.320 --> 47:09.670
We're also wondering
why Sherry's calling Dwight out

47:09.801 --> 47:12.151
on that because we just saw her
packing up a raft,

47:12.282 --> 47:13.979
and we don't quite know why,

47:14.110 --> 47:16.112
but that's what the episode
is all about unfolding.

47:16.242 --> 47:18.331
What is going on
between the two of them?

47:18.462 --> 47:20.594
I'm coming in hot.
I'm going to need a hand off.

47:20.725 --> 47:22.248
Morgan.Morgan.

47:22.379 --> 47:24.947
I repeat, I am coming in hot.

47:25.077 --> 47:27.471
The first time we see Morgan,
we want to have a little bit

47:27.601 --> 47:29.342
of fun with that moment.

47:29.473 --> 47:32.258
You know, at the end of the
prior episode, we saw him take

47:32.389 --> 47:36.001
Baby Mo from John Dorie,
and then we saw John Dorie

47:36.132 --> 47:38.569
walk back to the Walkers
to buy Morgan time.

47:38.699 --> 47:41.137
And our hope is that
the audience would be expecting

47:41.267 --> 47:43.791
that Morgan and Baby Mo
escaped fully.

47:43.922 --> 47:47.534
But we built this scene really
to reveal this road behind him

47:47.665 --> 47:49.362
and then slowly lift up

47:49.493 --> 47:51.321
and see that it is just filled
with thousands of walkers.

47:51.451 --> 47:54.150
And then we learn
that he actually drew

47:54.280 --> 47:57.283
the walkers away from the Tower.
And what do you do

47:57.414 --> 47:59.807
when you have thousands
of walkers on your tail?

47:59.938 --> 48:01.635
How do you get rid of them?

48:01.766 --> 48:03.463
Dwight and I might not have
enough ammo to take them out.

48:03.594 --> 48:06.205
You definitely do not because
there are a lot of them.

48:06.336 --> 48:08.599
How many?

48:08.729 --> 48:10.383
It's all of them.

48:10.514 --> 48:13.734
Obviously walker hordes
play a big part in this season,

48:13.865 --> 48:16.389
from the very first episode

48:16.520 --> 48:19.653
when Strand lit the light
on top of the tower

48:19.784 --> 48:22.613
and drew all of the walkers
to form a moat.

48:22.743 --> 48:25.572
We've seen that moat grow
over the past few episodes,

48:25.703 --> 48:29.011
and, you know, here we see it
break off.

48:29.141 --> 48:31.056
It does present a lot of
challenges

48:31.187 --> 48:34.755
in terms of production,
especially when we're producing

48:34.886 --> 48:37.410
these episodes
under COVID protocols.

48:37.541 --> 48:39.282
I mean, in order to keep
everyone safe, we're limited

48:39.412 --> 48:42.285
to the number of walkers
that we can have on set.

48:42.415 --> 48:46.506
So it really ends up becoming
a -- the realm of visual effects

48:46.637 --> 48:51.207
where we shoot things with the
small number of walkers we have

48:51.337 --> 48:54.079
and then we shoot them many
times so we can create tiles

48:54.210 --> 48:55.863
and then fill the space
that way.

48:55.994 --> 48:58.692
And then also we have
digital 3D walkers,

48:58.823 --> 49:01.652
where we have
a large number of walkers

49:01.782 --> 49:03.567
who have been scanned
and can be animated,

49:03.697 --> 49:08.789
and we can use those walkers
to really fill out the herd.

49:12.706 --> 49:14.273
Morgan!

49:14.404 --> 49:15.579
I'm sorry.

49:15.709 --> 49:18.277
When we last saw Alicia,
she told Morgan

49:18.408 --> 49:21.672
that she was going out to find
more people to join the cause,

49:21.802 --> 49:24.501
that she essentially wanted
to become Padre herself

49:24.631 --> 49:27.460
and find all the people who were
stuck out in the apocalypse,

49:27.591 --> 49:30.028
tell them that there was a place
that they could live,

49:30.159 --> 49:32.683
but they just needed to help her
take it from Strand.

49:32.813 --> 49:36.034
And when she returns and we see
that she's empty handed,

49:36.165 --> 49:37.514
we see the obvious
frustration there.

49:37.644 --> 49:40.299
But we also see
some more frustration from her

49:40.430 --> 49:43.911
when she learns that Morgan
has essentially set the gears

49:44.042 --> 49:47.828
in motion to attack the Tower,
that the time is now.

49:47.959 --> 49:49.308
There's no waiting.

49:49.439 --> 49:50.614
The tower's unguarded,
at least until dawn.

49:50.744 --> 49:53.399
We only get one shot at this,
and we're not ready.

49:53.530 --> 49:55.923
Ultimately, her arc
in this episode

49:56.054 --> 49:59.275
is getting to the point
where she can actually admit

49:59.405 --> 50:01.712
deep down that she still cares
about Strand,

50:01.842 --> 50:03.496
despite everything
he did to her.

50:03.627 --> 50:06.282
There's still a part of her
that she's worried

50:06.412 --> 50:08.066
won't be able to do
what needs to be done

50:08.197 --> 50:10.851
to take the Tower,
that will be drawn in by Strand.

50:10.982 --> 50:13.115
And I think even beneath
that is just some worry

50:13.245 --> 50:14.855
that she's going to have
to hurt someone

50:14.986 --> 50:17.554
that she once cared
about very deeply.

50:17.684 --> 50:19.643
And that's a very hard thing
for her to

50:19.773 --> 50:20.905
kind of wrap her head around.

50:21.036 --> 50:24.300
Morgan, we're not...
ready.

50:24.430 --> 50:27.390
It's the only way to make sure
that Mo is safe.

50:27.520 --> 50:31.611
Mo very much is all about
the future for these characters,

50:31.742 --> 50:33.744
about the next generation,
and, you know, she really

50:33.874 --> 50:36.529
has been, since the moment
we saw her born

50:36.660 --> 50:38.792
on the show
at the beginning of season six,

50:38.923 --> 50:41.926
she represented the new life
that was to come.

50:42.057 --> 50:45.930
You know, and we saw her father,
Isaac, give his life for her.

50:46.061 --> 50:50.804
We then later saw her mother,
Rachel, give her life for Mo.

50:50.935 --> 50:53.894
And then Morgan took her on
as his own child,

50:54.025 --> 50:56.158
along with Grace,
and the two of them

50:56.288 --> 51:00.684
have been really fighting
to not just keep her alive,

51:00.814 --> 51:05.384
but also to create a world
that she'd want to grow up in.

51:05.515 --> 51:08.779
And, you know,
we saw Strand try to co-opt that

51:08.909 --> 51:11.956
by bringing her to the tower
and using her for leverage,

51:12.087 --> 51:14.915
and then thinking that perhaps
she would be the thing

51:15.046 --> 51:17.222
that would give him the love
he desires,

51:17.353 --> 51:19.746
if he was able to raise her
in the way he wanted.

51:19.877 --> 51:21.096
Beyond a symbolic level,

51:21.226 --> 51:22.619
it really is all
about the future

51:22.749 --> 51:25.012
and these characters thinking
about, you know,

51:25.143 --> 51:27.145
surviving in the apocalypse
isn't enough --

51:27.276 --> 51:30.627
that you have to find
bigger things to fight for.

51:30.757 --> 51:31.845
What the hell is that?

51:31.976 --> 51:34.805
I call it an automobile.

51:34.935 --> 51:39.157
I will take credit
for the automobile joke,

51:39.288 --> 51:44.771
and I'll just say that's
my dad joke cred there.

51:44.902 --> 51:48.166
But really, that moment
was all about

51:48.297 --> 51:50.603
just showing a bit of levity
from Dwight

51:50.734 --> 51:54.955
and the potential for who Dwight
could be as a father

51:55.086 --> 51:57.654
when he's around
someone as innocent as a child.

51:57.784 --> 51:59.830
It's just hard for me to see
with her like this.

51:59.960 --> 52:01.179
We know what's coming.

52:01.310 --> 52:03.268
We heard the offer
that Strand made.

52:03.399 --> 52:04.356
What does that have
to do with me?

52:04.487 --> 52:06.402
I don't want you to turn
into the person

52:06.532 --> 52:07.620
that you don't want to be.

52:07.751 --> 52:09.622
We've been over this before,
okay?!

52:09.753 --> 52:11.798
It's not going to happen.

52:11.929 --> 52:14.323
When Dwight hears
that Sherry's worried

52:14.453 --> 52:17.195
that he might actually
go to Strand,

52:17.326 --> 52:19.415
he is hurt
because in his mind,

52:19.545 --> 52:21.199
he's wondering how
Sherry could think

52:21.330 --> 52:23.767
he would ever put himself
in a position

52:23.897 --> 52:26.117
where he has to answer
to someone like Strand,

52:26.248 --> 52:27.814
where he'd essentially
be reliving

52:27.945 --> 52:30.252
what they went through
at the Sanctuary with Negan.

52:30.382 --> 52:34.038
And Dwight doesn't know
what's really behind that.

52:34.169 --> 52:37.781
So he senses that Sherry
is really struggling

52:37.911 --> 52:40.044
with something,
and I think he's worried

52:40.175 --> 52:44.004
that it has to do with him
and her feelings for him.

52:44.135 --> 52:46.572
But ultimately, you know,
we learn that

52:46.703 --> 52:49.619
there's a very different reason
Sherry's worried.

52:49.749 --> 52:51.708
I think I might be
pregnant.

52:51.838 --> 52:54.711
This is where Sherry actually
explains why she's worried

52:54.841 --> 52:57.322
that Dwight might go to Strand,
because I think

52:57.453 --> 53:01.457
Sherry believes that if
Dwight thinks she's pregnant,

53:01.587 --> 53:04.242
that he will do
what's best for the child

53:04.373 --> 53:05.852
and not what's best for him.

53:05.983 --> 53:07.419
If this is positive,

53:07.550 --> 53:10.074
you're going to want to do
what's best for her,

53:10.205 --> 53:14.165
even if that means
going into Strand's Tower.

53:14.296 --> 53:20.650
Come on. If we do that.
If we go into that place,

53:20.780 --> 53:24.131
it will destroy all
the parts of you that I love.

53:24.262 --> 53:26.656
But ultimately, it's actually
the thing that allows

53:26.786 --> 53:28.310
Sherry and Dwight
to come closer together

53:28.440 --> 53:30.050
because they're now
on the same page.

53:30.181 --> 53:33.097
Dwight now knows what
Sherry's worried about.

53:33.228 --> 53:36.579
And Dwight's able to reassure
her that, you know, in his mind,

53:36.709 --> 53:40.104
he thinks it gives them
more reason to fight Strand.

53:40.235 --> 53:41.410
You don't get
to do this alone.

53:41.540 --> 53:43.977
especially when we're
in this together.

53:44.108 --> 53:45.762
They not be out already?

53:45.892 --> 53:48.155
Give them some time.

53:48.286 --> 53:51.985
Alicia is in a position
where she realizes

53:52.116 --> 53:54.423
she has to be the one to lead.

53:54.553 --> 53:57.164
But ultimately, I think it's
the fact that Morgan tells her

53:57.295 --> 54:00.603
she can do this --
that the one character

54:00.733 --> 54:04.128
who, you know,
in 7A came to her and said,

54:04.259 --> 54:07.523
"I need you to help me lead.
I can't do it all on my own."

54:07.653 --> 54:09.742
He's now essentially
saying to her,

54:09.873 --> 54:11.744
"You can do it on your own.
I believe in you."

54:11.875 --> 54:15.182
I think that's a big part of why
she has the confidence to do it.

54:15.313 --> 54:18.011
And the other part is that she
doesn't really have a choice.

54:18.142 --> 54:20.405
She knows that someone's
got to stand up to Strand,

54:20.536 --> 54:23.365
and if anybody can get
through to him, it's her.

54:23.495 --> 54:25.541
You know, in many ways,
this season has been about

54:25.671 --> 54:27.760
Alicia kind of shedding
the past.

54:27.891 --> 54:30.763
We have seen her
come into her own

54:30.894 --> 54:32.156
and change in a lot of ways.

54:32.287 --> 54:33.766
I mean, obviously,
she lost an arm.

54:33.897 --> 54:36.813
She'd been struggling with
this kind of mysterious illness.

54:36.943 --> 54:39.250
And she's kind of found
this inner strength

54:39.381 --> 54:41.034
that she didn't know she had.

54:41.165 --> 54:43.123
And she's going to carry
that strength forward

54:43.254 --> 54:45.561
as she leads everyone
to face Strand.

54:45.691 --> 54:47.954
We got to move!

54:48.085 --> 54:51.915
Sun sets in a few hours.

54:52.045 --> 54:53.090
Follow me.
