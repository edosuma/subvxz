[upbeat pop music playing]

00:21.563 --> 00:22.814
Alfie!

00:22.897 --> 00:24.024
Cooper!

00:24.107 --> 00:26.067
Ah, mwah!

00:27.402 --> 00:28.820
And what are you doing here?

00:28.903 --> 00:30.196
I knew how much you miss me

00:30.280 --> 00:32.073
and didn't want you to wait
another minute.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.284
So you. Always thinking of my feelings.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.495
So how was the trip?
Did Mom have a fun birthday?

00:37.579 --> 00:38.663
Yeah, it was really nice.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.207
I wish you would've FaceTimed me.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.293
I could've said "happy birthday"
to the fam.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.212
Well, that's not really
how I want you to meet them.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.425
So, what did you tell them
about me anyway?

00:51.051 --> 00:54.387
Oh, just that… you know, um…

00:55.972 --> 00:58.641
Oh, my God! You didn't tell them
about me at all, did you?

00:58.767 --> 01:01.186
Not yet, but that's normal for me.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.356
Look, I just don't bring up anyone
I'm dating to my family right away.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.941
I've been burnt a few times.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.736
So what are you saying?
You don't trust me?

01:09.819 --> 01:13.615
Emily, I promise you,
this isn't about you.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.033
This is all me.

01:16.451 --> 01:18.912
Listen, I've got to get to
a meeting at Antoine's.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.246
Can we talk about this later?

01:20.330 --> 01:22.957
Oh, yes, we will definitely
be talking about this later.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.375
Can I kiss my girlfriend now?

01:28.379 --> 01:30.090
Let's not become one of those couples

01:30.173 --> 01:33.259
that spend more time analyzing
their relationship than being in one.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.387
Oh, God, no. I hate those people.
So annoying.

[pensive music playing]

02:41.035 --> 02:44.122
[in French] I really do need to get
to Orly. I'm going to miss my flight.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.707
You just got here.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.588
We're hosting two huge events
at the club this week.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.630
You could come with me.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.632
-Hmm?
-[Sylvie sighs]

02:54.716 --> 02:56.551
It's going to be an incredible party.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.596
I have a business to run.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.098
And it's not that easy lately.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.185
I have a business to run too.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.770
I was hoping you'd join me

03:07.854 --> 03:09.898
for opening night of the opera tomorrow.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.153
Do you know why this works so well?

03:16.654 --> 03:19.574
We get to be together
and still do everything we want.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.329
You don't have to come to Saint-Tropez…

03:25.205 --> 03:27.373
And you don't have to go to the opera.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.666
<i>-Je sais.</i>
-[chuckles]

03:28.750 --> 03:29.751
Exactly.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.715
We should be enjoying ourselves
every second we can.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.676
Life is short.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.474
Then you should get going
before you miss your plane.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.601
[laughs]

03:56.361 --> 03:58.279
[in English] We need to
elevate the restaurant.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.697
And what does that mean?

03:59.781 --> 04:03.201
That means raising the bar on everything,
including our desserts.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.704
-I need a pastry chef.
-Your desserts are excellent.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.872
Not good enough.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.124
Pastry chefs are expensive.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.293
That's the price of getting
a Michelin star.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.796
A Michelin star? Are you dreaming?

04:14.879 --> 04:16.881
Actually, yes, I'm dreaming big.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.425
Well, the restaurant is already popular.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.010
And now I want it to be great.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.681
Also… I'm gonna need a raise.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.893
Wait. We're just beginning to break even.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.561
Now is not the time.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.691
I have an offer from another restaurant.
More money, more opportunity.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.485
That's a step back.
You have your own restaurant.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.611
Your restaurant.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.281
-Your company's name out front, not mine.
-[sighs]

04:41.364 --> 04:44.200
Why don't I run the numbers
and we'll see what we can do?

04:49.330 --> 04:50.290
Fine.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.542
But I'm not promising anything.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.210
Excuse me.

04:59.173 --> 05:00.925
Hell of a "welcome home", mate.

05:01.009 --> 05:01.926
I'm sorry.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.971
-Thanks for your help.
-Sure, sure.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.265
Now the boss is gone,

05:07.348 --> 05:10.768
maybe you want to tell me where
this is coming from all of a sudden?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.479
This stays between us?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.315
Yeah, of course.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.240
We love the work you've done
for other fashion houses

05:24.324 --> 05:27.035
and we're excited to see
what you've come up with for Ami.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.037
Yes, and we're all big fans of the brand.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.079
[Julien] Yes.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.916
We want to highlight the romance
of Ami Paris

05:34.000 --> 05:35.460
and the city it calls home.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.837
The campaign will celebrate love,

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
Paris style.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.300
And will culminate with one couple's
surprise engagement

05:42.383 --> 05:44.385
live-streamed on Ami's Instagram account.

05:44.469 --> 05:46.012
That sounds terrific.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.847
And so romantic.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.682
How soon can we find the couple?

05:49.766 --> 05:52.268
We can work within
any time frame you need.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.188
Of course, but beyond the search,
we need to vet them.

05:55.271 --> 05:57.023
If they'll be the face of your brand.

05:57.106 --> 05:59.776
Plus you wanna make sure
they're both on the same page

05:59.859 --> 06:01.277
because one of them could be all in

06:01.361 --> 06:04.405
and the other could be hiding their
relationship from everyone.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.617
It's just something to think about

06:07.700 --> 06:10.703
to make sure that the campaign
doesn't blow up in our faces.

06:12.246 --> 06:14.207
Which it won't. I assure you.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.084
We will find the perfect couple

06:16.167 --> 06:18.169
and make sure this is a huge success.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.551
Alfie hasn't told his family about us

06:25.635 --> 06:27.762
because he doesn't know
if he can trust me.

06:27.845 --> 06:31.182
With respect, you have been a little
"one foot in, one foot out" with him.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.725
But that was a long time ago.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.060
Well, trust takes time.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.521
You're gonna have to sit back
and be patient.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.480
You're right.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.191
I hate it, but… you're right.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.027
So, how are you and Nicolas?

06:43.528 --> 06:46.447
Still coming to La Trompette Bleue
every night to hear you sing?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.032
Well, not after tomorrow.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.203
-They're ending my residency.
-What? What happened?

06:52.286 --> 06:54.497
They're launching
a Crazy Horse style revue.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.166
Totally nude.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.751
Okay…

06:58.835 --> 07:01.879
And I feel naked enough
when I'm performing, so hard pass.

07:01.963 --> 07:02.880
God, that's awful.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.883
I can't believe you let me yammer on
about Alfie like that.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.135
Why didn't you tell me?

07:07.218 --> 07:10.138
It's okay, really. I found out
about it yesterday, and I…

07:10.930 --> 07:12.849
processed it already with Nicolas.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.809
He's been really great.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.899
Now that Alfie's back in town,
maybe the four of us could get drinks?

07:21.983 --> 07:23.443
If Nico is up for it?

07:23.526 --> 07:26.571
I know I'm probably not his
favorite person after the Cadault mess.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.240
Yeah, you did kinda
blindside him the other night.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.241
[chuckles]

07:30.783 --> 07:32.285
And… me.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.998
Emily, it put me
in a really difficult position,

07:37.081 --> 07:39.500
because my best friend

07:40.418 --> 07:42.795
humiliated my boyfriend
in front of his dad,

07:42.879 --> 07:44.839
and you know I always have your back,

07:44.922 --> 07:48.050
but I just feel like
you chose work over me.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.971
I understand. I'm really, really sorry.

07:52.054 --> 07:55.308
And you're right. Again,
I should've given you a heads-up,

07:55.391 --> 07:58.019
but it just all spiraled
out of control so fast.

07:58.102 --> 08:01.439
Yeah. Nicolas is throwing me
a party tomorrow,

08:01.522 --> 08:03.316
after my swan song,

08:03.399 --> 08:06.360
so will you come and see
if we can all get past this?

08:06.444 --> 08:09.530
Of course. Yes, count me in. And Alfie.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.699
Even if I am his dirty little secret.

08:11.782 --> 08:13.868
As long as you guys are keeping it dirty.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.536
-You'll be fine.
-[chuckles]

08:32.595 --> 08:33.763
[in French] No, it's nothing.

08:33.846 --> 08:36.349
I've got an extra opera ticket
tomorrow night, but…

08:36.432 --> 08:38.684
You're going to opening night
of <i>Le Nozze di Figaro?</i>

08:38.768 --> 08:40.853
It's my favorite!

08:40.937 --> 08:42.897
The drama! The arias!

08:44.482 --> 08:45.566
Would you like to join me?

08:46.317 --> 08:48.611
I would adore it!

08:48.694 --> 08:50.821
I have to try on my tuxedo
when I get home.

08:50.905 --> 08:55.159
I haven't worn it since father's funeral,
but I'm sure it still fits.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.830
[Luc singing opera]

09:10.174 --> 09:12.468
[in English] What do you think
of these couples?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.762
It's for this fashion company
that I work for

09:14.845 --> 09:17.974
and they wanna have this live-stream,
spontaneous proposal

09:18.057 --> 09:21.060
but it has to come as a surprise
to the person being proposed to.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.144
Okay…

09:22.228 --> 09:26.232
But what kind of idiot would want to put
their personal life out there like that?

09:26.315 --> 09:28.484
The kind looking to make a ton of money.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.652
My kinda guy.

09:29.735 --> 09:34.448
There are plenty of co-working spaces
in Paris with better lighting than my bar.

09:34.532 --> 09:38.035
We are here having a drink.
I'm just in a crunch.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.583
Emily has an account
looking to pay big money

09:43.666 --> 09:45.626
to someone proposing marriage…

09:45.710 --> 09:47.545
Some kind of fashion campaign?

09:48.879 --> 09:51.757
Do you know where she could
find a couple like that?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.303
What is going on here?
What are you not telling me?

09:55.386 --> 09:58.431
It's nothing, just something
with Camille and I.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.600
Oh, no. I thought you'd work things out.

10:00.683 --> 10:04.020
We are. I'm planning to propose.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.105
-Hmm?
-Ka-ching!

10:06.188 --> 10:08.232
-[chuckles]
-Wait, you knew about this?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.900
He told me this afternoon.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.528
Wow.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.947
Just… so fast.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.157
Um…

10:16.240 --> 10:18.367
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.620
I haven't proposed yet.
Camille doesn't know.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.831
Ah, this is going to be a big surprise.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.416
Hopefully a happy one.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.585
Mate, I think it answers
all your problems.

10:27.668 --> 10:31.380
You're looking for money and
you're looking for a spectacular couple.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.469
Of course, we have to have you vetted.

10:36.552 --> 10:39.013
And find an Ami-approved location
around the city

10:39.096 --> 10:41.223
for the live-stream proposal
to take place.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.893
Are you sure you're okay with all that?

10:44.602 --> 10:46.896
Basically, you want to be
counting on a "yes."

10:47.855 --> 10:49.315
I need to get back there.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.566
Think about it, mate.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.487
Why aren't you jumping
all over this solution?

10:55.154 --> 10:58.574
Do you not think they have the
<i>"je ne sais quoi"</i> for the campaign or…

10:58.658 --> 11:01.661
No, actually, I think that
they're perfect for it. It's just…

11:03.329 --> 11:06.707
A few days ago, Gabriel told me
that they were kind of at an impasse

11:06.791 --> 11:09.543
and he wasn't sure if they were
going to stay together. So…

11:09.627 --> 11:11.712
Yeah, well, every couple hits that point.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.506
It's either time to break it off

11:13.589 --> 11:15.132
or commit to each other.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.967
You're either in or you're out.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.304
Yeah, I guess that's true.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.598
I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

11:24.642 --> 11:25.476
Okay…

11:43.411 --> 11:45.371
[soft rock music playing]

12:30.708 --> 12:33.335
This is only a preliminary scout.
We're just looking,

12:33.419 --> 12:34.837
you can bow out at any time.

12:34.920 --> 12:35.963
Why would I bow out?

12:36.464 --> 12:37.840
No reason I can think of.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.050
Anyway, this is the most cinematic option.

12:40.634 --> 12:43.012
Classic monument, amazing views.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.222
But I think we'd want to shoot from above

12:45.306 --> 12:47.475
so we can get
the full backdrop of the city.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.061
It's beautiful up here but there's…
It's a lot of tourists.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.105
True, but that's because it's iconic.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.316
I'm sure we could coordinate
crowd control.

12:55.399 --> 12:57.985
Not too much
because you want it to be authentic.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.946
[screams] Yes, yes, yes! I do, yes!

13:02.615 --> 13:04.825
Oh, my God, we're getting married!

13:04.909 --> 13:06.160
[woman] We're getting married!

13:06.243 --> 13:07.119
[people applauding]

13:07.203 --> 13:09.789
I don't think you're the first
to have this idea.

13:09.872 --> 13:12.124
No problem. I have options.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.376
[chuckles]

13:15.753 --> 13:17.755
The Museum of Romantic Life.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.382
What do we think? It's pretty cute, right?

13:20.925 --> 13:24.094
Very Instagrammable and there's
lots of art for your gallery girl.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.556
True, but I feel like Camille's tastes
are a bit more avant-garde.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.227
Have you read any George Sand?

13:31.310 --> 13:32.645
I think I've heard of him.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.980
That's her.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.942
Oh. Well… then, no.

13:38.609 --> 13:41.445
We studied her in school.
She was a very progressive,

13:41.529 --> 13:44.281
subversive author
who dressed in men's clothes

13:44.365 --> 13:46.700
and ignored rules for women's behavior.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.788
It says here that she left her husband
for a <i>rebellion romantique.</i>

13:50.871 --> 13:53.040
Apparently lots of affairs with men.

13:53.958 --> 13:54.917
Women too.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.335
Oh.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.005
You know what?
Maybe this isn't so romantic after all.

14:00.089 --> 14:00.923
Why not?

14:01.465 --> 14:02.967
Relationships are complicated.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.136
Intense passion makes people
do crazy things.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.307
Maybe it's the wrong vibe
for your engagement.

14:10.808 --> 14:11.851
I don't know.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.855
Only the two people involved
know what they are to each other.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.859
You know, I have some other options.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.155
[romantic music playing]

14:29.326 --> 14:30.995
This one might be my favorite.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.080
The Wall of Love.

14:33.163 --> 14:37.167
A calligraphist collected over 300 ways
of saying "I love you" in a notebook

14:37.751 --> 14:41.589
and then worked with a muralist to
engrave them on tiles made of lava.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.299
I wonder why lava.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.634
[Gabriel] So they'll last forever.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.095
It's beautiful.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.847
Simple, but really moving.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.640
I think she'll love it.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.768
[sighs]

14:54.852 --> 14:56.061
Can I ask you something?

14:57.104 --> 15:00.316
What happened with you and Camille
when she came back from Greece

15:00.399 --> 15:02.526
that suddenly made you
want to get married?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.989
We opened up to each other
in a way we never had before.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.409
Do you remember
that restaurant in Provence?

15:10.492 --> 15:11.744
The chef with the kids.

15:11.869 --> 15:15.956
I felt like I saw my future
right in front of me

15:16.040 --> 15:17.666
and I want to start building it.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.626
It's time.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.087
And the money from the campaign
is definitely gonna help.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.882
Well, let's get you engaged.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.259
Thank you.

15:28.510 --> 15:29.553
For being a friend.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.931
Travel down the road and back again.

15:34.016 --> 15:34.850
<i>Golden Girls.</i>

15:35.976 --> 15:37.269
<i>Golden Girls?</i>

15:38.395 --> 15:39.271
Never mind.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.358
You're welcome, friend.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.742
[playful music playing]

15:56.997 --> 16:00.042
[in French] I'll have the entrecote
and a salad, please.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.377
Very funny.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.963
How many waiters you know look this good?

16:04.046 --> 16:06.674
That's none of your business.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.259
Why are you wearing a tuxedo
at 10:00 a.m.?

16:10.135 --> 16:13.722
I am accompanying <i>Madame</i> Grateau
to <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i> this evening.

16:14.306 --> 16:17.184
And I won't have time to go home
between work and the opera.

16:17.267 --> 16:20.437
Oh, look, your opera date.
What a night you have to look forward to.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.147
<i>Bonjour,</i> Sylvie.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.859
I hope you are as excited as I am
for this evening.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.699
[in English] Good, you're all here.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.367
I found the perfect Ami couple.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.077
Gabriel is proposing to Camille.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.872
[Luc] A handsome chef

16:38.956 --> 16:41.458
and a hypnotic beauty in the arts.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.002
Emily, you've done it again.

16:43.585 --> 16:45.379
[sarcastically] Yeah, she's done it again.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.881
I can put together a deck
in a couple hours

16:47.965 --> 16:50.092
if you want to bring
Georges back in today.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.637
Yeah. Yes, of course.
We wanna wrap this up as soon as possible.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.015
Great.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.225
[Julien] Sylvie.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.268
What?

16:59.351 --> 17:00.561
[in French] I need to speak with you.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.646
I've got a busy morning.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.648
Can it wait until lunch?

17:04.732 --> 17:06.859
Fine. This will be easier with wine.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.694
Lunch sounds lovely.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.571
Where shall we go?

17:11.363 --> 17:12.489
What?

17:17.953 --> 17:19.955
Ah, I love this place!

17:20.456 --> 17:22.833
Presentation is so undervalued.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.918
Speaking of undervalued…

17:25.002 --> 17:27.004
Julien, please stay calm.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.840
Emily completely swooped in on my client

17:29.923 --> 17:31.884
like a tiny vulture in a crop top.

17:31.967 --> 17:32.926
And this isn't the first time
it's happened.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.387
Listen, I understand your frustration--

17:35.471 --> 17:36.805
And yet you don't share it.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.433
When Emily wins, the company wins.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.771
Yes. We're all on the same team.

17:43.854 --> 17:44.730
Could you pass the bread?

17:44.855 --> 17:47.107
And Emily is not a good teammate.

17:47.191 --> 17:51.403
Teams don't work when there is a ball hog!

17:51.528 --> 17:53.822
I have more experience.
I have seniority.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.032
For God's sake, I speak French!

17:55.115 --> 17:57.076
Okay, Julien! I'll speak to her.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.535
But I will not spend an entire lunch

17:58.619 --> 17:59.661
listening to you complain
about Emily Cooper.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.580
How much more of this
am I supposed to take?

18:01.663 --> 18:02.498
[slams]

18:03.165 --> 18:04.291
Ah, <i>non!</i>

18:05.334 --> 18:07.628
Okay, I have other things to do.

18:07.711 --> 18:08.962
Sorry.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.506
I don't have time for this.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.882
<i>-Au revoir.</i>
-Sylvie…

18:11.965 --> 18:13.133
Now look what you've done.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.051
Look.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.145
[in English] So…

18:25.813 --> 18:26.897
We considered a raise

18:26.980 --> 18:28.732
but Alfie had a better proposition.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.943
We'd like to give you a stake
in the restaurant.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.654
Okay. What does that mean, exactly?

18:33.737 --> 18:35.697
It means you participate in the profits

18:35.781 --> 18:37.616
and in more of the business decisions

18:37.699 --> 18:39.701
since they will be linked to your salary.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.122
Like hiring expensive pastry chefs,
for example.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.374
If the restaurant succeeds, you succeed,

18:46.083 --> 18:47.417
-if it doesn't--
-It will.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.379
And I know you'll work your ass off
to make it even better.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.006
Especially when it's your name
on the front door.

18:53.841 --> 18:54.967
Really?

18:55.050 --> 18:57.052
I can change the name of the restaurant?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.512
It will be your restaurant.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.722
I'll be your silent partner.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.433
You will be silent?

19:05.310 --> 19:06.478
More or less.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.771
So what do you think?

19:08.730 --> 19:10.691
You can either bet on yourself

19:10.774 --> 19:12.109
or take the other offer.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.653
Do we have a deal?

19:20.909 --> 19:23.162
We have a deal. Thank you, Antoine.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.167
We have to get to the office,
but we'll have the paperwork sent over.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.544
I'll be right out.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.299
Well, well, well, your own restaurant.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.968
I guess you'll have to turn down
that other offer.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.429
Right, uh…

19:40.512 --> 19:41.680
That was…

19:41.763 --> 19:43.724
Totally fabricated
for bargaining leverage?

19:43.807 --> 19:45.976
-How did you know?
-Because I know you.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.020
You're my boy, come on.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.356
I cannot believe this.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.483
Believe it. And get to work.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.737
<i>Au revoir,</i> Chef.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.948
[upbeat pop music playing]

20:26.099 --> 20:28.060
[in French] No way! That's incredible.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.895
I still can't believe it.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.897
I can.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.774
You've been working towards this
for so long.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.787
[Camille] Do you remember
we had one of our first dates here?

20:47.371 --> 20:48.622
And you'd just gotten a job in a kitchen.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.291
That terrible place in the 11th.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.710
-God, that chef was a dick.
<i>-Ouais.</i>

20:53.794 --> 20:55.087
Worst job I've ever had.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.505
Ah, but you were excited.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.423
You had so many dreams. Remember?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.592
I remember that date, actually.
I was so intimidated by you.

21:01.718 --> 21:02.552
Me?

21:03.428 --> 21:04.263
Why?

21:05.639 --> 21:07.891
You knew everything
about every single piece.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.893
No, you just didn't know anything.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.228
[both chuckle]

21:11.895 --> 21:13.814
But look at you now,
you come here as much as I do.

21:21.738 --> 21:22.781
[laughs]

21:48.140 --> 21:49.224
What is it?

21:50.809 --> 21:51.810
Camille.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.941
I had big dreams
the first time we came here.

22:00.360 --> 22:01.820
And they've only gotten bigger.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.032
I see my life with you.

22:08.076 --> 22:08.910
Me too.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.415
Let's get married.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.918
You took the words out of my mouth.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.422
Is that a yes?

[ethereal music playing]

22:32.726 --> 22:33.727
[chuckles]

22:48.784 --> 22:51.995
[in English] Thank you so much for
coming in on such short notice.

22:52.079 --> 22:55.499
We are so excited about
the couple we have found.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.459
-So chic and fabulous.
-[phone vibrates]

22:57.542 --> 23:00.212
Oh, actually, he's calling me right now.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.465
I'll just step right out.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.011
Hey, is everything okay?

23:08.762 --> 23:11.056
Big news. Camille and I just got engaged.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.766
What? What happened?

23:13.266 --> 23:15.602
<i>She asked me and I said yes.</i>

23:16.520 --> 23:19.064
I'm sorry, I hope this doesn't
screw anything up for you.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.024
No. No, no, don't be sorry.

23:21.691 --> 23:22.943
I'm really happy for you.

23:23.443 --> 23:26.029
But I'm here with a client
so I have to go.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.072
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

23:28.323 --> 23:32.494
The Wall of I Love You is a charming
secret gem of Paris.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.912
Much like your logo,

23:33.995 --> 23:36.415
cleverly hidden,
except for those in the know.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.793
Anyone who recognizes
this little butterfly

23:39.876 --> 23:41.628
is a very chic insider.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.004
It's not a butterfly.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.214
Ah, no?

23:44.840 --> 23:47.717
Oh, I see it now. No, it's a balloon.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.386
Anyway, as I was saying--

23:49.469 --> 23:51.847
May I interrupt?
It's actually about the couple.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.515
As if I could stop you.

23:54.641 --> 23:57.769
Well, they're just so in love
that they couldn't wait.

23:57.853 --> 24:00.313
And… Well, they just got engaged.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.566
-What?
-And sacrificed all that money?

24:02.649 --> 24:05.569
Well, if you're really in love,
the money doesn't matter.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.947
And it made me wonder
whether or not this proposal angle

24:09.030 --> 24:10.824
is actually as romantic as we thought.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.744
We're trying to manufacture a moment
that is supposed to come from the heart.

24:16.663 --> 24:17.581
Perhaps it's true.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.000
So I'd love to propose
a different direction.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.668
Emily, can we speak privately?

24:21.751 --> 24:23.086
No, I'd like to hear this.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.463
So would I.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.176
Okay, well…
We put your brand front row, center.

24:29.259 --> 24:30.886
Your logo already looks like a balloon.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.388
So what if we made it a hot air balloon?

24:33.472 --> 24:34.723
Or several of them.

24:34.806 --> 24:38.602
Floating above the French countryside
with couples in love.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.896
It would be so gorgeous and dreamy.

24:40.979 --> 24:43.773
"Love is in the air."

24:43.857 --> 24:46.276
That… That could be our tagline.

24:46.359 --> 24:48.945
I love that. How soon
can we make this happen?

24:49.029 --> 24:51.323
Well, we'll have to work quickly.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.616
Very, very quickly.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.619
But I think we can pull this together.

24:55.702 --> 24:56.536
[Georges] Fantastic.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.123
[mouthing] Love is in the air.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.043
[Emily speaking indistinctly]

25:04.127 --> 25:05.670
[Emily] Yeah. I have ideas.

25:08.006 --> 25:10.550
But that was a great one.
"Love is in the air"

25:17.516 --> 25:19.059
[tense music playing]

25:23.396 --> 25:24.272
Luc?

25:24.356 --> 25:25.774
[in French] Me?

25:25.857 --> 25:26.858
What's the matter?

25:26.942 --> 25:27.901
What's going on?

25:27.984 --> 25:31.780
I've been soaking my shirt in the sink
since lunch

25:31.863 --> 25:33.532
and I think it's getting better.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.534
But not good enough.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.451
Obviously…

25:36.535 --> 25:37.869
As I can well see.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.331
So, I will race home on my bicycle
after work and change.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.917
I will be very sweaty, I think.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.378
I'm not someone who sweats a lot, frankly,

25:46.461 --> 25:47.462
but if I can't take a shower…

25:47.546 --> 25:49.256
But I am ready to suffer for this art.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.632
[Sylvie] Luc.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.135
It's been a stressful day,
and I'm not feeling well.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.806
I don't think I can make it.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.224
Oh, no!

26:02.894 --> 26:05.438
I was so looking forward
to a beautiful night at the opera.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.898
Me too, Luc. Me too!

26:06.982 --> 26:09.442
-Honestly, I-- What?
-Luc.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.486
Hold on. Excuse me, I should take this.
Can you leave?

26:12.112 --> 26:13.113
[whines]

26:14.197 --> 26:16.366
<i>Maman?</i> Is everything all right?

26:16.449 --> 26:17.701
<i>Of course, dear.</i>

26:17.784 --> 26:20.245
I'm calling to see
if everything is all right with you.

26:20.328 --> 26:23.540
I know this isn't always the easiest day.

26:23.623 --> 26:24.916
What's today?

26:25.625 --> 26:26.918
<i>Don't lie to your mother.</i>

26:27.836 --> 26:31.131
Anniversaries are always difficult
when things…

26:31.214 --> 26:34.092
<i>don't quite work out.</i>

26:34.759 --> 26:38.430
<i>Maman,</i> Laurent and I are still married.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.973
And we've been seeing
a lot of each other lately.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.433
How wonderful.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.144
<i>And what are you doing this evening?</i>

26:44.227 --> 26:45.937
He's at his club in Saint-Tropez.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.648
On your anniversary.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.526
Sylvie, why do you put up with this?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.528
Actually, I'm going to the opera.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.656
Ah! Well, I wish I was there
to be with you.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.993
Okay. Thank you for calling, <i>Maman.</i>

27:00.076 --> 27:00.910
[kisses]

27:00.994 --> 27:01.870
I love you.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.413
Goodbye.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.206
[sighs]

27:13.923 --> 27:16.551
[woman singing operatically]

27:22.557 --> 27:23.558
[Sylvie sighs]

27:29.272 --> 27:30.398
<i>-Bonsoir.</i>
<i>-Bonsoir.</i>

27:31.483 --> 27:33.109
I'm on the benefit committee

27:33.193 --> 27:35.487
and my guest couldn't make it.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.821
Is there a way to donate this back?

27:36.905 --> 27:38.239
I'm sorry.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.575
It's too late for anyone to use it.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.160
Are you sure about that?

27:46.206 --> 27:48.041
-What are you doing here?
-[chuckles]

27:48.124 --> 27:50.085
Did you think I forgot what today is?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.252
Yes?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.340
Okay, I did.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.885
But as soon as I remembered,
I got on a plane.

28:01.554 --> 28:04.265
I don't want to drag you to something
you don't want to do.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.684
And I appreciate that.

28:07.018 --> 28:10.063
But tonight, I want to spend
my anniversary with my wife.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.441
[receptionist] <i>Mademoiselle?</i>

28:17.946 --> 28:20.073
<i>-Bonne soirée.</i>
<i>-Merci.</i>

[both laugh]

28:44.013 --> 28:45.515
[techno music playing]

28:49.185 --> 28:50.937
You killed that shit.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.772
You really saved the best for last.

28:52.856 --> 28:53.815
Thank you.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.609
They deserve one last reminder
of what they're throwing away.

28:56.693 --> 28:59.195
Mindy! Ciao!

28:59.279 --> 29:00.947
-[Mindy] Hey!
-You were fantastic.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.075
[both speaking Italian]

29:04.159 --> 29:06.327
Okay. No idea who that was.

29:06.911 --> 29:09.330
Nico really went overboard
with the guestlist.

29:09.414 --> 29:13.042
Do me a favor? If somebody asks me
to introduce them to you,

29:13.126 --> 29:14.919
please get them to say their name.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.171
Oh, we got you.

29:16.755 --> 29:17.964
Thank you, I love you.

29:18.047 --> 29:21.176
Should probably go say hi
to the Miss Universe pageant behind me.

29:21.259 --> 29:23.261
-I will see you later.
-Go get it, girl.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.096
[Emily] Um… Oh!

29:25.180 --> 29:28.141
Would you mind grabbing me
a glass of rosé?

29:28.224 --> 29:29.350
Yeah, of course, babe.

29:31.227 --> 29:32.228
Nicolas.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.273
-Hey.
-Emily.

29:35.774 --> 29:36.733
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

29:36.816 --> 29:40.695
This is so nice.
Thank you so much for organizing it.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.947
Mindy was pretty upset
when she got the news

29:43.031 --> 29:45.366
so I thought celebrating it
might cheer her up.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.912
I think we both really
just want her to be happy.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.664
You know, and she really likes you.

29:51.748 --> 29:55.001
And I know you probably
don't like me very much right now

29:55.877 --> 29:59.547
but I really hope that we can
put it past us,

29:59.631 --> 30:01.049
for Mindy's sake.

30:01.132 --> 30:03.051
That's very easy for you to say.

30:03.676 --> 30:06.805
You weren't publicly humiliated
in front of your entire family.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.849
Do you have any idea what that was like?

30:11.017 --> 30:13.645
No. Uh, I don't.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.023
And I'm truly sorry.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.569
Look, you don't seem ready
to talk about it yet

30:21.653 --> 30:23.321
and I don't want it to escalate tonight,

30:23.404 --> 30:25.990
so you can seat me as far away
from you as possible.

30:26.115 --> 30:29.369
<i>Bonsoir, bébé</i>. Everybody being nice?

30:29.911 --> 30:30.829
Um…

30:30.912 --> 30:33.498
Yeah, I was just telling him--

30:33.581 --> 30:35.750
Unfortunately,
Emily was saying she can't stay.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.710
Oh, no, what happened?

30:37.836 --> 30:38.837
Um…

30:43.216 --> 30:44.634
No. No, I'm so sorry.

30:44.717 --> 30:45.552
Uh…

30:46.052 --> 30:48.847
I was going to tell you.
Alfie has a business dinner.

30:48.930 --> 30:53.393
And since it's Maison Lavaux, so do I.

30:54.477 --> 30:57.355
Yeah, and he got the date wrong
and we're already late

30:57.438 --> 31:00.108
so… I'm so sorry.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.026
No, I get it. Work's important.

31:02.735 --> 31:05.530
Yeah. But we'll celebrate soon, okay?
My treat?

31:05.613 --> 31:07.156
Yeah, sure, of course.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.660
-We should probably get seated for dinner.
-Yes.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.203
[Mindy] Have a good night, okay?

31:13.371 --> 31:14.414
Okay, come on. I…

31:16.040 --> 31:17.208
What's going on?

31:19.669 --> 31:20.962
[sorrowful music playing]

31:28.469 --> 31:30.471
[Emily] Nicolas is allowed
to be upset,

31:30.555 --> 31:33.516
but I can't believe he'd try
and ruin Mindy's night over it.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.227
That brat's lucky he's not in the bins
behind the restaurant.

31:36.311 --> 31:37.478
You'd fight him for me?

31:37.562 --> 31:38.771
I'd do anything for you.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.482
Well, almost anything.

31:42.191 --> 31:43.484
Ah!

31:43.568 --> 31:46.738
You're still upset
that I've not told my family about us.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.489
I'm not upset. I just…

31:49.073 --> 31:50.533
I just wanna understand.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.201
What are you so afraid of?

31:53.828 --> 31:54.746
All right.

31:55.997 --> 31:58.166
The last girl I introduced to my family

31:58.249 --> 32:01.127
said we were moving too fast
and broke up with me.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.087
The one before that

32:03.171 --> 32:04.797
said she loved me…

32:05.798 --> 32:07.300
but wasn't sure I was the one.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.930
-And then the one before that--
-Okay, I'm sorry.

32:12.472 --> 32:15.183
Every time I think
I'm in a real relationship

32:15.266 --> 32:16.351
and I tell my family,

32:17.101 --> 32:18.895
the rug gets pulled out from under me.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.481
And I never see it coming.

32:22.273 --> 32:23.733
Do you know what that's like?

32:23.816 --> 32:24.651
Yeah.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.236
I do.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.614
My last boyfriend

32:29.697 --> 32:32.450
in Chicago, we were together forever.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.953
I thought we were going to get married,

32:35.036 --> 32:36.913
which seems insane now.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.999
He couldn't even get on a plane
to come visit me here.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.085
That must've been awful.

32:42.877 --> 32:45.463
Yeah. Yeah, it was devastating.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.425
More than I've admitted
to anyone, I think.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.011
I threw myself into work
to forget about it.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.224
But then, when you moved to Paris,

32:56.307 --> 32:57.558
to give us a chance…

32:58.142 --> 32:59.519
I moved for the job.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.522
And for you.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.691
When you did that…

33:06.025 --> 33:06.943
it meant a lot.

33:07.568 --> 33:09.320
Finally a guy showed up for me.

33:10.113 --> 33:13.157
So, yeah, I'm not trying to pressure you.

33:13.241 --> 33:16.285
I want you to tell your family
when you're ready.

33:16.369 --> 33:19.998
But you will have to eventually
because I'm not going anywhere.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.712
I'm ready. Should we FaceTime my mum?

33:25.795 --> 33:28.131
-What?
-Or just call?

33:28.214 --> 33:31.134
I didn't mean right now,
because she's probably sleeping.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.219
-Good point.
-Yeah.

33:33.302 --> 33:36.514
Then… maybe we should
make it Instagram-official.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.267
Is that still a thing?
Do the people still do that?

33:39.350 --> 33:40.309
[chuckles]

33:41.185 --> 33:42.186
Hmm…

33:44.439 --> 33:45.273
Actually…

33:46.065 --> 33:47.859
I think I have a better idea.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.447
["Love Is In The Air" playing]

33:56.367 --> 33:58.536
I guess the whole world's
gonna know about us now.

33:58.619 --> 33:59.996
[chuckles nervously]

34:00.079 --> 34:03.916
This is actually a little scarier
than expected.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.126
I'm scared too.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.462
But it's worth it.

["Love Is In The Air" continues playing]
