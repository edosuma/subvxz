[sighs] I'm not sure I wanna take
either one of those jobs though.

33:03.609 --> 33:06.737
Because it might mean leaving here.

33:07.613 --> 33:10.407
- It would also mean following your dream.
- Hm.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.994
And a fresh start with your son.

33:15.412 --> 33:17.414
- Yeah.
- And I like LA.

33:19.082 --> 33:20.334

33:21.502 --> 33:23.045

Ugh. Fucking hell.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.089

33:27.341 --> 33:31.011
Oh, look at that.
It's California red.

33:31.011 --> 33:33.180
Speaking of which, have you done
any California dreaming

33:33.180 --> 33:34.681
since we talked earlier?

33:34.681 --> 33:37.476
[giggles] I have...

33:37.476 --> 33:39.228
- lots of dreams.
- Do you now?

33:40.395 --> 33:41.772
Meaning?

33:46.401 --> 33:48.278
Okay, you're right.

33:48.278 --> 33:50.781
I do need to get unstuck.

33:52.449 --> 33:55.911
But, the stuff that
I need to unstick is here.

33:56.912 --> 33:59.164
- In New York.
- Yeah.

33:59.164 --> 34:02.292
Well, I thought that might be
where this was headed. It's okay.

34:02.292 --> 34:05.587
But I could come visit. I like LA.

34:05.587 --> 34:08.298
In... small doses.

34:08.298 --> 34:10.592
Yeah, me, too. [laughs]

34:14.304 --> 34:16.306
- [glasses clink]
- Pick again. No, you did it!

34:17.307 --> 34:19.643
Los Angeles. A city so nice,

34:19.643 --> 34:21.812
they named it Los Angeles.

34:21.812 --> 34:24.857
- So, everyone's going there.
- But, in the Big Apple we remain.

34:24.857 --> 34:27.150
Maybe we could dig up
a cold case or something.

34:27.150 --> 34:29.111
- [door opens]
- I got a cold case for ya!

34:29.653 --> 34:30.821

CHARLES: How'd you get in here?

34:34.408 --> 34:36.201
SAZZ: Who knows?
Have I made copies of all your keys?

34:36.201 --> 34:38.662
Like I said, who... knows?

34:38.662 --> 34:40.539
Okay, okay. Photo op.

34:40.539 --> 34:42.374
- Photo op. I love these. Alright.
- Oh yeah.

34:42.374 --> 34:44.126

34:44.126 --> 34:45.210

SAZZ: Hey, listen, um,

34:45.210 --> 34:47.713
I got something I need to talk to you
about when you get a sec, huh?

34:47.713 --> 34:49.256
- It's a little sensitive.
- Yeah, sure.

34:49.256 --> 34:52.092
Hey! Well, since we're celebrating,
I'm gonna go upstairs,

34:52.092 --> 34:53.135
and I'm gonna get a bottle of

34:53.135 --> 34:57.347

Oh!
[text notification chimes]

35:05.856 --> 35:07.608
Wow.

35:07.608 --> 35:10.110
I just got a romantic

35:10.110 --> 35:11.695
What?
OLIVER: Ooh...

35:11.695 --> 35:13.780
SAZZ: What'd she say?
CHARLES: She says,

35:13.780 --> 35:16.283
"Scott Bakula says hi."

35:16.283 --> 35:17.576
That's not romantic.
