00:02.540 --> 00:04.034
Happy Birthday, Dad!

00:04.058 --> 00:05.848
Aww. Thanks, guys.

00:07.558 --> 00:09.097
"Happy 80th Birthday."

00:09.098 --> 00:10.467
Anna-Kat, that's not my age.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.177
Seemed like a reasonable guess.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.807
And why is the tiger on the card
attacking me?

00:13.808 --> 00:14.967
So many notes.

00:14.968 --> 00:17.204
Do you want the card or not?

00:17.228 --> 00:19.267
And this is from me.

00:19.268 --> 00:22.387
99 shares of CincoNext.

00:22.388 --> 00:23.637
They're doing
some really incredible things

00:23.638 --> 00:24.927
in the biotech space.

00:24.928 --> 00:26.347
Each share trades at a penny,

00:26.348 --> 00:27.927
but over time,
they could be worth millions.

00:27.928 --> 00:28.728
Or nothing.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.557
Or <i> millions.</i>

00:30.558 --> 00:31.767
Happy Birthday, Dad!

00:31.768 --> 00:33.177
Aww.

00:33.178 --> 00:34.677
It's a coupon for one clean room.

00:34.678 --> 00:36.057
Hm.

00:36.058 --> 00:38.227
I'm 9 years old. What's <i> your</i> excuse?

00:38.228 --> 00:41.267
What? Dad's always riding me
to clean my room, so now I will.

00:41.268 --> 00:43.735
Actually, I love it,
and I'm cashing it in now.

00:43.759 --> 00:44.767
Go clean your room.

00:44.768 --> 00:47.609
Damn. I was really banking
on you losing the coupon.

00:47.633 --> 00:50.542
Three kids with three gifts
all coming in under $1.

00:50.543 --> 00:52.809
So what? Where's <i> your</i> gift?

00:52.833 --> 00:55.172
- Mom forgot!
- No, I didn't!

00:55.173 --> 00:57.752
I would never, ever forget
my husband's birthday.

00:57.753 --> 00:59.274
<i>Okay, I did!</i>

00:59.298 --> 01:01.292
<i>Now lash out at the kids
to draw attention away from it.</i>

01:01.293 --> 01:02.672
It is your father's birthday,

01:02.673 --> 01:04.212
and you're not even
making him breakfast?!

01:04.212 --> 01:06.002
- All right! Okay.
- Okay.

01:06.003 --> 01:07.372
Who raised you?!

01:07.373 --> 01:08.833
Don't answer that!

01:10.793 --> 01:12.922
I have your present,
but I can't give it to you yet

01:12.923 --> 01:14.422
because it's a surprise.

01:14.423 --> 01:15.582
For <i> tonight.</i>

01:15.583 --> 01:16.832
- I knew it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16.833 --> 01:18.602
You're throwing me
the birthday dinner party

01:18.626 --> 01:20.649
you've always promised me!

01:20.673 --> 01:23.872
Yeah, buddy! How'd you know?!

01:23.873 --> 01:25.422
Finally, an adult dinner party.

01:25.423 --> 01:27.082
- Nay... a salon,
- Mm.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.873
where we discuss art
and wear scarves indoors!

01:33.633 --> 01:36.091
I've been asking for years,
and now we're doing it!

01:36.673 --> 01:39.332
Now, only question left is...

01:39.333 --> 01:40.672
which scarf should I wear?

01:40.673 --> 01:42.212
<i>The real question is,</i>

01:42.213 --> 01:43.808
<i>which scarf should I hang myself with?</i>

01:43.832 --> 01:46.637

01:49.526 --> 01:51.238
Guys, I messed up.

01:51.262 --> 01:53.011
I forgot Greg's birthday.

01:53.012 --> 01:54.851
Ohh! That's bad.

01:54.852 --> 01:56.051
I did the same thing to Celeste,

01:56.052 --> 01:57.891
and that pretty much led to our divorce.

01:57.892 --> 02:00.115
Well, that and all
the other women you slept with

02:00.139 --> 02:01.141
who weren't your wife.

02:01.142 --> 02:03.551
Hey, she knew I was an Aries
when she married me.

02:03.552 --> 02:04.971
Oh, my God, what a great defense.

02:04.972 --> 02:06.972
- Did you use that in court?
- I did.

02:06.973 --> 02:08.351
But the judge was a Capricorn, so...

02:08.352 --> 02:09.851
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

02:09.852 --> 02:11.221
No hablo cuckoo.

02:11.222 --> 02:13.221
So, what's happening with Greg?

02:13.222 --> 02:15.011
I lied to him about
forgetting his birthday,

02:15.012 --> 02:16.681
so now I have to throw him
a dinner party.

02:16.682 --> 02:17.682
Can you two make it?

02:17.683 --> 02:19.221
Ah! Richard and I will be there.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.416
Anything to get away from the kids.

02:21.440 --> 02:23.931
"Mom! Play board games with us!"

02:23.932 --> 02:25.719
I swear it's like
they don't even know me.

02:25.743 --> 02:26.750
I'm in, too.

02:26.774 --> 02:28.101
Mind if I bring my new girlfriend?

02:28.102 --> 02:30.051
Her name is Crissy, she's a therapist,

02:30.052 --> 02:31.812
and I honestly think
she could be the one.

02:35.052 --> 02:36.851
Are you on Tinder right now?

02:36.852 --> 02:38.051
Wh... I'm just browsing.

02:38.052 --> 02:39.431
Oh, God.

02:44.722 --> 02:46.811
Are you sure you didn't forget
Dad's birthday?

02:46.812 --> 02:48.471
'Cause this all seems very last-minute.

02:48.472 --> 02:50.311
The caterers, which I ordered weeks ago,

02:50.312 --> 02:51.811
canceled on me this morning.

02:51.812 --> 02:54.395
Anyone not believe that? Huh?!

02:54.432 --> 02:56.198
Anyone?

02:56.222 --> 02:57.471
That's what I thought.

02:57.472 --> 02:59.471
Now, tonight is an adult night,

02:59.472 --> 03:01.891
so that means you are all going upstairs

03:01.892 --> 03:04.431
and staying there till morning.

03:04.432 --> 03:05.931
But what if there's an earthquake

03:05.932 --> 03:08.681
or a rapture or an AI singularity?

03:08.682 --> 03:10.431
You are only allowed to come down

03:10.432 --> 03:13.181
if there's visible blood...
active bleeding.

03:13.182 --> 03:14.762
You got to fill this cup above the line.

03:15.852 --> 03:18.311
All right! Everybody upstairs!

03:21.182 --> 03:22.551
Remember to clean your room for Dad.

03:22.552 --> 03:24.761
I was going to! God!

03:26.682 --> 03:28.811
What is that thing
where you've been asleep

03:28.812 --> 03:30.101
and you wake up years later

03:30.102 --> 03:31.971
and all of your kids are grown up

03:31.972 --> 03:33.181
and you've lost all that time?

03:33.182 --> 03:34.182
A coma?

03:34.183 --> 03:35.812
A coma.

03:37.642 --> 03:40.051
- I'm ready for my salon!
- Great!

03:40.052 --> 03:42.141
Because Doris and Angela
are going to be here any second.

03:42.142 --> 03:44.811
Doris and Angela? That's my salon?

03:44.812 --> 03:46.351
Who am I gonna have
intellectual debates with?

03:46.352 --> 03:47.811
Angela is well-read.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.221
She belongs to a lesbian book club.

03:49.222 --> 03:50.681
She doesn't let me come

03:50.682 --> 03:52.851
because she thinks I'm going to
make fun of their haircuts.

03:52.852 --> 03:54.971
But they know it's not
a normal dinner party, right?

03:54.972 --> 03:56.221
Because I'm reading a poem!

04:00.052 --> 04:01.311
Hey, real quick... if Doris asks you

04:01.312 --> 04:02.811
why we couldn't go to dinner last week,

04:02.812 --> 04:04.471
it was because of your hernia surgery.

04:04.472 --> 04:05.851
Got it? Great.

04:05.852 --> 04:07.511
I didn't have a hernia.
Why did you lie to Doris?

04:07.512 --> 04:08.891
I can't tell her the truth.

04:08.892 --> 04:11.091
Dinners at her house are the worst!

04:11.116 --> 04:13.177
Richard is either on the phone
or talking about his commute,

04:13.202 --> 04:16.351
- and Doris hits on you the entire time.
- No, she doesn't.

04:16.351 --> 04:17.887
Why'd you have to go give me a hernia?

04:17.913 --> 04:18.930
I don't know!

04:18.932 --> 04:20.391
She sprang the invitation on me.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.656
How am I supposed to keep up this lie?

04:21.682 --> 04:23.851
Just don't mention it.
And don't lift anything heavy.

04:23.852 --> 04:25.431
This is so stupid.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.141
You know I hate it when you
put me in these situations.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.761
How am I supposed to act
like I have a hernia?

04:28.762 --> 04:29.762
This'll help.

04:30.972 --> 04:32.891
Hi!

04:32.892 --> 04:34.552
Happy birthday, Greg!

04:34.577 --> 04:36.192
- Hi, everyone!
- Happy birthday!

04:36.217 --> 04:37.601
Hi.

04:37.602 --> 04:39.435
- Have we been here long enough?
- Shut up!

04:39.460 --> 04:41.261
Welcome! Let me take your coats.

04:41.262 --> 04:43.311
- Oh! I'm so glad we could come.
- Thank you.

04:43.312 --> 04:44.642
Good.

04:45.993 --> 04:47.102
Hernia!

04:49.052 --> 04:50.351
I have a hernia.

04:50.352 --> 04:52.953
His nether regions
are still quite blown out.

04:52.978 --> 04:54.154
Mm.

04:54.682 --> 04:56.721
Okay, OCD girl, have at it.

04:56.722 --> 04:58.435
Halloween, Christmas...

04:58.472 --> 05:00.641
this.

05:00.642 --> 05:02.101
Can I borrow your phone charger?

05:02.102 --> 05:03.932
Sure, if you can find it.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.257
This is disgusting.

05:11.282 --> 05:12.569
My bib jersey!

05:12.594 --> 05:13.999
I've been looking everywhere for that!

05:14.024 --> 05:15.991
- Your what?
- My bib jersey.

05:15.992 --> 05:17.821
Whenever I eat something greasy
in my room,

05:17.822 --> 05:19.726
I put on a jersey to protect my clothes.

05:19.751 --> 05:20.791
Genius, right?

05:21.912 --> 05:23.611
I fear for your future.

05:23.612 --> 05:24.991
Aah!

05:24.992 --> 05:26.741
I can't believe
I touched your bib jersey!

05:26.742 --> 05:29.201
And there's nothing clean enough
in here to wipe my hands on!

05:29.202 --> 05:31.127
Don't worry... it's covered
in so much old food,

05:31.152 --> 05:32.491
there's no way you touched fabric.

05:32.492 --> 05:34.502
You should be in prison.

05:34.527 --> 05:35.701
Uh, guys?

05:35.726 --> 05:37.841
The room is on fire.

05:41.242 --> 05:43.020
Uh, Mom?

05:43.045 --> 05:44.840
Visible... blood!

05:44.865 --> 05:46.451
'Kay.

05:50.532 --> 05:52.872
So, Richard, how are things?

06:00.742 --> 06:04.072
So, Crissy, Angela tells me
that you are a therapist.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.119
How do you like it?

06:05.144 --> 06:06.353
I think the better question is,

06:06.354 --> 06:07.995
how do <i> you</i> like being a mother?

06:11.064 --> 06:13.104
So, Richard, whatcha typing?

06:15.224 --> 06:16.353
Nothing?

06:16.354 --> 06:18.313
All right.

06:18.314 --> 06:19.523
What are we going to do?

06:19.524 --> 06:21.853
Mom and Dad are going to kill us!

06:21.854 --> 06:23.490
Well, Dad's gonna lecture us,

06:23.515 --> 06:26.570
and then Mom's gonna take
the doors off all our rooms.

06:26.604 --> 06:28.393
That'd be really bad for <i> you,</i> Oliver.

06:28.394 --> 06:30.223
I have nothing to hide.

06:30.224 --> 06:33.566
But, at the same time,
we do need to cover this up,

06:33.591 --> 06:36.183
and the only way we're gonna
do that is if we stick together.

06:36.184 --> 06:39.983
Like this slice of pizza
attached to Taylor's math book?

06:39.984 --> 06:42.434
<i>That's</i> why third period is so confusing!

06:44.684 --> 06:47.523
- Oh. Your hand is so big.
- Thanks.

06:47.524 --> 06:48.773
I feel very safe right now.

06:48.774 --> 06:49.983
I'm so glad.

06:49.984 --> 06:52.144
- Doris, let's compare hands.
- Oh!

06:52.145 --> 06:53.183
Ow!

06:53.184 --> 06:54.603
Knock it off!

06:54.604 --> 06:57.433
Oh, God. Greg is going for
one of his skinny poetry books.

06:57.434 --> 06:58.983
Those are the worst kinds.

06:58.984 --> 06:59.894
Who's in the mood for a sonnet?

06:59.894 --> 07:00.814
- No.
- Almost.

07:00.815 --> 07:02.183
Changing subject.

07:02.184 --> 07:04.933
So, Greg, you seem to be
recovering nicely.

07:04.934 --> 07:06.143
Recovering?

07:06.144 --> 07:08.813
From the hernia surgery...

07:08.814 --> 07:10.183
that you had.

07:10.184 --> 07:11.853
Oh, yes. Well,
the procedure went smoothly.

07:11.878 --> 07:12.871
It was no big deal.

07:12.896 --> 07:15.009
Katie said it was a <i> very</i> big deal,
with a lot of complications.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.223
Oh... yeah.

07:18.224 --> 07:20.183
It going smoothly
actually <i> was</i> a complication

07:20.184 --> 07:21.933
because they expected it to be bad,

07:21.934 --> 07:23.723
but then when it looked
like it was good,

07:23.724 --> 07:25.183
it threw everyone off, and...

07:25.184 --> 07:27.789
because they were like,
"Aah! Why isn't this going bad?"

07:27.814 --> 07:29.183
And then, um...

07:29.184 --> 07:31.338
I started bleeding out of my... butt.

07:32.484 --> 07:33.684
I'll get that.

07:38.524 --> 07:39.644
Mmm.

07:41.389 --> 07:43.178
What?

07:43.179 --> 07:45.298
How are you carrying that
if you just had hernia surgery?

07:45.299 --> 07:47.008
Oh, these...

07:47.009 --> 07:49.758
darn pain meds give me
a false sense of strength.

07:49.759 --> 07:51.838
I hope I'm not bleeding
from my butt again.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.678
What's going on?!

07:53.679 --> 07:54.718
Okay.

07:54.719 --> 07:55.838
We lied.

07:55.839 --> 07:57.758
Greg didn't have hernia surgery.

07:57.759 --> 08:00.178
They're our friends.
We should tell them the truth.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.838
Yes, thank you.

08:01.839 --> 08:05.798
The real reason that we couldn't
go to dinner last week is...

08:07.469 --> 08:08.889
...Greg and I were in couples therapy.

08:09.839 --> 08:11.838
Our marriage is not great.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:21.049 --> 08:23.298
So, you two are in couples therapy?

08:23.299 --> 08:25.548
She's not being nosy.
That's a professional question.

08:25.549 --> 08:28.388
- She's a doctor.
- I'm not a doctor.

08:28.389 --> 08:30.178
I'm a psychologist.

08:30.179 --> 08:32.217
But she knows how to <i> play</i> doctor.

08:34.099 --> 08:35.717
<i>Now</i> can we go?

08:35.719 --> 08:37.837
Richard, pretend to go to the bathroom

08:37.839 --> 08:39.889
and play on your phone,
like you do at home.

08:42.299 --> 08:44.838
Our marriage has been in trouble
for quite some time.

08:44.839 --> 08:47.468
I know... it's shocking.

08:47.469 --> 08:49.138
- Is it?
- Makes sense to me.

08:49.139 --> 08:51.428
Okay. Please take your seats for dinner.

08:51.429 --> 08:53.468
Katie, if I could talk to you
for a second?

08:53.469 --> 08:57.008
We're gonna go talk
about our terrible marriage.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.968
So,<i> that's</i> coming clean to
your friends? Just another lie?

09:01.969 --> 09:03.258
I had to!

09:03.259 --> 09:05.218
You couldn't fake a hernia,
so I had to pivot!

09:05.219 --> 09:06.638
Well, now everyone thinks
our marriage is in trouble.

09:06.639 --> 09:08.008
But it's not!

09:08.009 --> 09:09.758
You understand how lying works, right?

09:09.759 --> 09:11.258
But everyone bought it so easily.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.428
No one was like, "Whaaaat?!"

09:12.429 --> 09:13.798
I wanted a "Whaaaat?!"

09:13.799 --> 09:15.928
Couples therapy is the perfect lie.

09:15.929 --> 09:18.928
It's personal, so no one will
ask any follow-up questions.

09:18.929 --> 09:20.008
I don't like it one bit.

09:20.009 --> 09:21.508
We won, Greg!

09:21.509 --> 09:23.429
Take the win! Enjoy it!

09:25.139 --> 09:28.218
And remember, we need to fake
like we're in a rough patch.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.598
Don't find me as delightful
as you usually do.

09:30.599 --> 09:32.258
That won't be hard.

09:35.889 --> 09:38.008
Guys, I'm not trying to be cocky,

09:38.009 --> 09:39.468
but I think we did it.

09:39.469 --> 09:41.048
Yeah, great job, Taylor.

09:41.049 --> 09:42.508
But I also went
and got this from the attic

09:42.509 --> 09:43.798
so we can paint over it.

09:43.799 --> 09:46.388
Now we just need a screwdriver
to open the can.

09:46.389 --> 09:47.888
I'll just go downstairs and grab one.

09:47.889 --> 09:49.718
But Mom told us to stay up here.

09:49.719 --> 09:52.139
Trust me... she won't even notice.

09:54.599 --> 09:56.678
Visible blood!

09:56.679 --> 09:57.719
'Kay.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.572
Okay!

10:01.597 --> 10:02.961
Um, we're gonna
have to open the paint can

10:02.986 --> 10:04.004
with whatever's in here.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.072
Nope.

10:07.655 --> 10:08.705
Nope.

10:09.759 --> 10:10.928
Nope.

10:10.929 --> 10:13.321
I'm all out of pencils. I give up.

10:15.099 --> 10:16.970
Come on, Buttercup.

10:16.995 --> 10:18.454
Use those chompers.

10:19.759 --> 10:22.798
That's it. You've embarrassed me
in front of my family.

10:22.799 --> 10:25.120
Tonight, you're sleeping with the LEGOs.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.799
And that's how it's done, people.

10:32.839 --> 10:34.389
Oh, no!

10:35.639 --> 10:37.638
Just so you know, what you two
are doing is really healthy.

10:37.639 --> 10:38.968
Thanks, but honestly,

10:38.969 --> 10:40.450
Katie and I have never been better.

10:40.475 --> 10:42.174
The whole therapy thing
is just preventative...

10:42.199 --> 10:43.598
like ant traps.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.869
That's a fun topic.
Let's talk about ants.

10:45.894 --> 10:48.338
Did you know they can lift
30 times their body weight?

10:48.339 --> 10:50.860
Greg, look, there's no shame
in therapy, okay?

10:50.885 --> 10:52.735
Some of the most prominent
people in Westport see me.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.888
I mean, should the Mayor
be ashamed of his sessions?

10:54.889 --> 10:57.534
Isn't that a breach
of client confidentiality?

10:59.009 --> 11:00.639
Shoot.

11:02.549 --> 11:04.468
Don't be hard on yourself, Greg.

11:04.469 --> 11:06.672
<i>Any</i> man would've been worn down by now.

11:06.697 --> 11:08.178
- We totally get it.
- Yeah.

11:08.179 --> 11:11.604
I'm sorry, but what exactly
do you totally get?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.541
Do you two think that <i> I</i> am the reason

11:13.566 --> 11:14.627
that we're in therapy?

11:14.652 --> 11:16.098
- Katie!
- Katie!

11:16.099 --> 11:18.838
Greg, tell them that is <i> not</i> the case.

11:18.863 --> 11:21.178
- It's... the case.
- Mm.

11:21.179 --> 11:23.008
Can I talk to you in your office
for a second?

11:23.009 --> 11:25.546
We're gonna continue to talk
about our terrible marriage

11:25.571 --> 11:26.691
and how it's her fault.

11:28.227 --> 11:29.516
Poor Greg.

11:29.541 --> 11:31.290
Oh, I hate to see them like this,

11:31.291 --> 11:33.290
but I love to watch him walk away.

11:34.371 --> 11:36.160
Mnh.

11:36.161 --> 11:37.392
"Poor Greg"?

11:37.417 --> 11:38.978
It should be "Poor Katie"!

11:39.003 --> 11:41.307
We won, Katie. Take the win.

11:41.332 --> 11:43.790
- Enjoy it!
- You like this.

11:43.791 --> 11:46.410
- This is a little victory for you.
- Mm-hmm.

11:46.411 --> 11:47.540
Have your fun,

11:47.541 --> 11:49.870
but I just can't stand
that they're judging me.

11:49.871 --> 11:51.427
Doris is terrible to Richard,

11:51.452 --> 11:54.028
and Angela can't stay in
a relationship to save her life.

11:54.053 --> 11:55.060
If we tell the truth now,

11:55.085 --> 11:56.239
everyone is gonna think we're crazy.

11:56.264 --> 11:58.580
You started this lie.
Now let's see it through.

11:58.581 --> 12:00.040
Fine!

12:00.041 --> 12:01.798
And don't forget
to be extra abusive to me

12:01.823 --> 12:03.728
so everyone knows that our
marital problems are your fault.

12:03.753 --> 12:05.290
That won't be a problem.

12:10.451 --> 12:11.784
It says to blot.

12:11.809 --> 12:14.630
Don't rub, or you'll
make the stain worse.

12:15.585 --> 12:17.664
- Can you help, please?
- One sec.

12:17.689 --> 12:20.451
I'm trying to get this paint off
my Nordstrom's not Rack shirt.

12:21.447 --> 12:23.163
There! It's ruined!

12:23.188 --> 12:24.219
Now help!

12:24.253 --> 12:25.383
Well, let's see how <i> you</i> like it!

12:27.218 --> 12:29.845
Joke's on you. These are my bib pants!

12:32.081 --> 12:33.438
Guys!

12:34.765 --> 12:36.092
Holy [bleep]!

12:36.117 --> 12:37.870
Oh, my God. It went through
the wall. What do we do now?

12:37.895 --> 12:40.609
First, we watch our language.

12:43.001 --> 12:45.574
The drive is just the first leg.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.330
Next up is the train.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.410
If I catch the 7:21,

12:50.411 --> 12:53.540
I get into the city at 8:28.

12:53.541 --> 12:56.223
But if I catch the 7:26,

12:56.248 --> 12:58.575
I get there at 8:45.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.497
Please... tell us more.

13:00.522 --> 13:02.210
Unh-unh. Stop punishing us

13:02.211 --> 13:04.120
by encouraging Richard
to talk about his commute.

13:04.121 --> 13:06.210
All we said was that therapy
was a good thing!

13:06.235 --> 13:07.672
And that <i> I'm</i> the problem.

13:07.727 --> 13:09.655
Right! You get it!

13:09.680 --> 13:11.593
Just so you know, you two are the ones

13:11.618 --> 13:13.179
who should be in couples therapy.

13:13.204 --> 13:15.370
<i>You</i> can't keep your muskrat in its cage!

13:15.417 --> 13:17.206
What does that mean?

13:17.207 --> 13:18.826
You are so pretty.

13:18.827 --> 13:21.886
And <i> you</i> bag on your husband constantly!

13:22.497 --> 13:24.116
You talk about me?

13:24.117 --> 13:25.706
Aww.

13:25.707 --> 13:28.456
Okay, everyone, look.
Katie is projecting.

13:28.457 --> 13:31.914
Sometimes we have pent-up anger,
and we choose to lash out.

13:31.939 --> 13:32.976
No!

13:33.001 --> 13:35.286
This is not what this is.

13:35.287 --> 13:36.826
I lied.

13:36.827 --> 13:38.246
Greg and I aren't in therapy.

13:38.247 --> 13:39.416
I made the whole thing up

13:39.417 --> 13:40.960
just so I didn't
have to tell you the truth.

13:40.985 --> 13:42.360
The real reason we canceled

13:42.385 --> 13:44.921
is because dinners at your house
are the worst!

13:44.946 --> 13:47.632
Ah! I'll put <i> any</i> dinner at my house

13:47.657 --> 13:50.296
up against this garbage party
full of poetry and lies!

13:50.321 --> 13:52.860
And I suppose you lied
about Greg's ruptured colon

13:52.885 --> 13:54.786
to get out of going
to that sound bath with me.

13:54.787 --> 13:56.656
Why are you always giving me
medical problems?

13:56.657 --> 13:58.156
It's so easy to buy!

13:58.157 --> 13:59.689
You look disease-y, Greg.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.956
Okay, look, everybody calm down.

14:01.957 --> 14:03.036
You're right.

14:03.037 --> 14:04.956
And to put this in perspective,

14:04.957 --> 14:06.786
perhaps a poetry reading.

14:09.117 --> 14:11.996
I think Anne Sexton said it best...

14:11.997 --> 14:14.706
You think we're the only ones
she lies to?

14:14.707 --> 14:16.656
- She forgot about your birthday.
- What?

14:16.657 --> 14:19.821
And she threw this dinner party
at the last second as a cover.

14:19.883 --> 14:20.928
I don't believe it.

14:20.953 --> 14:21.996
Yeah, I do.

14:21.997 --> 14:23.656
Come on, Richard. We're leaving.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.349
But it's finally fun!

14:25.404 --> 14:26.774
Crissy, let's go.

14:38.207 --> 14:41.326
You forgot my birthday
and then lied about it.

14:41.327 --> 14:42.416
I did.

14:42.417 --> 14:44.203
But before you get too mad, remember...

14:44.250 --> 14:46.391
- your blood pressure is high.
- Right.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.578
Wait, is it? I don't know
what to believe anymore!

14:55.917 --> 14:57.656
I'm glad you decided to come.

14:57.657 --> 14:59.663
- We want to talk about last night.
- Yeah.

14:59.688 --> 15:01.956
I'm confused.
You have a breakfast at home,

15:01.957 --> 15:03.746
and then you come here
for another breakfast?

15:03.747 --> 15:05.172
Why is he not getting this?

15:06.117 --> 15:08.286
The pretty ones are sometimes slow.

15:08.311 --> 15:09.892
Mnh.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.194
Let's get down to it.

15:11.219 --> 15:12.996
Katie needs to be stopped.

15:12.997 --> 15:15.496
I agree. Her lying has become
a problem for all of us.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.656
She needs to be confronted,
<i>and</i> my pal Crissy can help.

15:18.657 --> 15:20.790
Downgraded to "pal" already, huh?

15:20.815 --> 15:23.359
Yeah, well, I've been making
eyes with the new waitress.

15:23.384 --> 15:26.032
She's... Oh. Nope.

15:26.057 --> 15:28.109
Nope, she's just
putting in her contact lens.

15:28.134 --> 15:30.286
My girlfriend, Crissy, can help.

15:33.917 --> 15:37.132
I got your text.
Where's James Van Der Beek?

15:37.157 --> 15:38.576
Not here.

15:38.577 --> 15:39.942
This is an intervention.

15:39.967 --> 15:42.114
I shaved above the knee for this?

15:42.139 --> 15:43.676
We're here to talk about your lying.

15:43.701 --> 15:44.656
I would love to,

15:44.657 --> 15:46.863
but I have to take Greg
to his colonoscopy.

15:46.888 --> 15:48.245
You have a real problem.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.019
Katie, please have a seat.

15:55.957 --> 15:58.469
Your lying has caused a rift
in your relationships,

15:58.494 --> 16:00.039
and you need to start telling the truth.

16:00.064 --> 16:02.036
Maybe <i> you</i> need
to start telling the truth.

16:02.037 --> 16:05.076
- You're not licensed to do that.
- Fine.

16:05.077 --> 16:07.076
Let's just get this over with.

16:07.077 --> 16:09.346
Okay. What are some of the lies

16:09.371 --> 16:12.319
that you've told
Doris, Angela, and Greg?

16:12.344 --> 16:13.394
Okay.

16:14.617 --> 16:17.217
Doris, remember you gave me money

16:17.242 --> 16:19.420
to bet on red when I went to Foxwoods?

16:19.445 --> 16:21.037
I lied. You didn't lose.

16:21.062 --> 16:23.273
I spent the money on a giant daiquiri.

16:24.295 --> 16:27.271
Now, Doris, remember, what do we say?

16:28.242 --> 16:30.411
Thank you for your honesty.

16:30.412 --> 16:31.661
You're welcome.

16:31.662 --> 16:34.451
Angela, remember
when you aligned my chakras

16:34.452 --> 16:37.201
and I told you it made me
less aggravated with my kids?

16:37.202 --> 16:39.901
When I got home, I sat on Oliver.

16:41.042 --> 16:42.471
Thank you for your honesty.

16:43.832 --> 16:44.991
Greg, you know how I told you

16:44.992 --> 16:46.741
I stopped using veal in the meatloaf

16:46.742 --> 16:48.653
because you didn't want
to eat little cows?

16:48.678 --> 16:50.919
- Don't say it. Don't say it.
- Didn't stop.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.703
So sad.

16:52.704 --> 16:54.703
So tender.

16:54.704 --> 16:57.153
Katie, why are you lying?

16:57.154 --> 16:58.371
You don't seem like the kind of person

16:58.396 --> 16:59.582
who's afraid to tell the truth.

16:59.607 --> 17:01.823
No. I'm not.

17:01.824 --> 17:03.823
I can do some crowd work to prove it.

17:03.824 --> 17:05.613
Hey, you! Laptop!

17:05.614 --> 17:06.880
For the last month,

17:06.905 --> 17:08.782
I have read that screenplay
over your shoulder,

17:08.784 --> 17:10.653
and it is <i> terrible.</i>

17:10.654 --> 17:12.823
If you're not afraid
to tell the truth to a stranger,

17:12.824 --> 17:14.323
then why do you feel
the need to lie to <i> us,</i>

17:14.324 --> 17:15.363
the people you love?

17:15.364 --> 17:18.422
I lie <i>because</i> I love you.

17:18.446 --> 17:21.573
- What?
- I don't want to hurt your feelings.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.403
And I want to keep putting veal
in my meatloaf.

17:24.404 --> 17:26.863
Katie, you told a lot of truths today.

17:26.864 --> 17:28.906
Are there any truths
you <i> haven't</i> told yet?

17:30.404 --> 17:31.494
There are.

17:33.094 --> 17:36.883
Doris, I know I have told you
that you're too harsh,

17:36.946 --> 17:38.695
but the truth is...

17:38.744 --> 17:41.635
you are the strongest person
that I know.

17:42.614 --> 17:44.363
Thank you for your honesty.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.356
And, Angela, I know sometimes

17:46.434 --> 17:49.176
I make fun of you for being a softie...

17:49.244 --> 17:52.598
but you are the kindest person
I've ever met.

17:52.947 --> 17:55.736
Thank you, Katie, for your honesty.

17:55.784 --> 17:59.118
And, Greg, the truth is...

17:59.204 --> 18:01.782
you are the best person that I know.

18:01.864 --> 18:03.508
Period.

18:03.574 --> 18:05.118
I love you.

18:05.154 --> 18:07.819
And I am so sorry
that I forgot your birthday.

18:07.844 --> 18:08.844
That's okay.

18:08.869 --> 18:10.028
I love you, too.

18:11.896 --> 18:13.655
And while we're on this truth train,

18:13.704 --> 18:17.014
you seem like a nice person, so...

18:17.074 --> 18:19.324
- get out now.
- Really?

18:20.606 --> 18:22.613
Are you gonna cheat on me?

18:23.312 --> 18:26.401
Girl, I don't know
what you got going on today,

18:26.426 --> 18:28.703
but you are looking fine!

18:28.704 --> 18:29.903
Mm!

18:47.324 --> 18:48.703
If she didn't clean her room,

18:48.704 --> 18:49.993
you're going to read her poetry.

18:49.994 --> 18:51.790
Culture should not be a punishment.

18:51.815 --> 18:53.815
But it <i> is.</i>

18:54.814 --> 18:56.153
You ready to show me the room yet?

18:56.154 --> 18:57.444
Come on in!

18:58.614 --> 19:01.175
Anna-Kat, do you have any 6s?

19:01.200 --> 19:03.113
Sorry, Oliver. Go fish!

19:03.138 --> 19:04.427
Taylor?

19:04.428 --> 19:05.678
What did you do?

19:07.848 --> 19:10.177
You cleaned your room!

19:10.178 --> 19:12.007
Cleaned <i>and</i> reorganized.

19:12.008 --> 19:13.033
Well, technically,

19:13.058 --> 19:15.181
"reorganized" implies
that it was once organized,

19:15.206 --> 19:16.478
but good job, kiddo.

19:17.428 --> 19:18.927
So good.

19:18.928 --> 19:21.217
It looks great!

19:21.218 --> 19:22.565
How long are we gonna
keep this a secret?

19:22.590 --> 19:24.007
Until I go to college.

19:24.008 --> 19:25.427
No, until <i> I</i> go to college.

19:25.428 --> 19:26.467
You're both saying the same thing.

19:32.178 --> 19:34.458
Happy birthday!

19:34.548 --> 19:38.098
From now on, I won't be such a liar.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.638
- Thanks, babe.
- Mm-hmm.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.637
Oh.

19:42.638 --> 19:45.157
A coupon for
one free intellectual salon.

19:45.182 --> 19:46.704
You can invite all your boring friends.

19:46.729 --> 19:48.048
You can talk about
all the crap you want.

19:48.073 --> 19:50.579
- You can wear whatever dumb outfit...
- Unh-unh-unh-unh.

19:50.604 --> 19:52.047
You know what?

19:52.048 --> 19:53.307
To Hell with Crissy.

19:53.308 --> 19:55.709
Maybe a healthy marriage
is based on lies.

19:55.734 --> 19:58.260
Then ours is the best.

19:59.712 --> 20:00.990
Thanks.

20:04.508 --> 20:06.018
Now that Taylor's left,

20:06.043 --> 20:07.257
the house feels so empty.

20:07.298 --> 20:10.364
But we can finally do
what we want with this room!

20:10.389 --> 20:12.771
Let's get rid of this bed
and put in a giant hot tub.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.076
What the hell?!

20:16.048 --> 20:17.888
What the hell?

20:20.008 --> 20:22.137
"Dear Mom and Dad,
by the time you read this,

20:22.138 --> 20:24.287
the statute of limitations
will have run out.

20:24.312 --> 20:26.307
Signed... Taylor, Anna-Kat, and Oliver."

20:26.308 --> 20:27.717
Oh!

20:27.718 --> 20:30.366
That explains why Taylor
had books in her room.

20:31.678 --> 20:35.066
Well, this is very troubling.

20:35.113 --> 20:36.127
Mm.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.580
We obviously can't have
your salon tonight, Greg.

20:40.098 --> 20:41.511
Then when?!

20:41.589 --> 20:46.589
