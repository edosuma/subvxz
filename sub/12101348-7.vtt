WEBVTT

00:08.925 --> 00:10.677
[Fitz] How do we know this isn't a trap?

00:10.760 --> 00:12.137
[Petra] Or how much time we'll have

00:12.220 --> 00:14.264
before Blackstar's mind
collapses back into mush,

00:14.347 --> 00:16.224
and then we can't get Walter back?

00:16.307 --> 00:17.308
What's your take?

00:18.393 --> 00:20.186
Well, it's a risk, no two ways about it.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.772
That's an understatement, Walter.
You could die.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.482
[inhales deeply]

00:25.066 --> 00:26.818
I'm the only one who can do it.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.821
It's the only way to find out
who's behind all this.

00:29.904 --> 00:30.739
Raikou.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.073
She could help.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.577
She's a psychic.
She's almost as strong as you are.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.580
We are not inviting a contract killer
into our own backyard.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.707
[Grace] George is relentless.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.918
This is the only way to find answers
before we get hit with another Blackstar

00:44.002 --> 00:45.754
or something a hell of a lot worse.

00:46.296 --> 00:47.589
We need Raikou.

00:48.339 --> 00:49.841
Walter, find her.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.259
[thunder rumbling]

00:55.555 --> 00:56.890
[car horns honking]

01:03.938 --> 01:06.566
[ominous music playing]

01:29.672 --> 01:30.673
[grunts]

01:31.466 --> 01:33.134
[yelling]

01:34.344 --> 01:35.345
[both grunting]

01:47.440 --> 01:48.566
[screams]

01:56.032 --> 01:57.325
[yells, grunts]

02:11.798 --> 02:13.049
[yells]

02:14.300 --> 02:15.927
[yells, grunts]

02:16.886 --> 02:18.680
[panting]

02:20.974 --> 02:23.518
[in Japanese] Where do you think
you're going, you piece of shit?

02:23.601 --> 02:24.769
-[yells]
-[gasps]

02:24.853 --> 02:26.521
[ethereal tinkling]

02:35.822 --> 02:36.739
[scoffs]

02:38.700 --> 02:39.993
You gotta be shitting me.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.955
Good to see you too. It's been a minute.

02:44.038 --> 02:44.956
I'm working.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.918
I'm monitoring the situation
through your eyes in Tokyo.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.713
The Rook is pissing himself.

02:52.338 --> 02:56.217
And what's left of his men are
still peeling themselves off the pavement.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.386
What do you want, Dad?

03:07.395 --> 03:08.438
I need a favor.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.858
[in Japanese] Kill this bitch!

03:13.276 --> 03:16.446
A favor? For you, a million a day,

03:16.529 --> 03:18.948
plus expenses,
or you could find someone else.

03:19.657 --> 03:22.160
Oh, wait. There is no one else.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.289
A million a day, plus expenses.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.957
You got yourself a deal, old man.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.883
[all grunting]

03:37.508 --> 03:38.384
[gasps]

03:46.684 --> 03:48.102
[in Japanese] Let's wrap this up.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.606
I just got another gig.

03:52.982 --> 03:53.816
[splattering]

03:54.651 --> 03:56.945
[dramatic music playing]

04:40.530 --> 04:42.824
[crew shouting indistinctly]

04:54.168 --> 04:56.421
[Sheldon] It all started
when my father died.

04:59.382 --> 05:02.593
I had a… an episode at his funeral.

05:04.971 --> 05:08.141
When I woke up in the hospital,
my father was there.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.104
We'd already put him in the ground,
but… but there he was.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.939
He tried to scare me off

05:16.441 --> 05:20.028
from putting the pieces together,
from… from solving that puzzle.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.407
You know, I think
he was trying to test me.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.076
Making sure that I was worthy,
that we were worthy.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.203
Worthy of what?

05:29.829 --> 05:33.124
From whatever's out there
waiting for us on that island.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.547
[crew shouting indistinctly]

05:42.091 --> 05:45.553
Two bags? [chuckles]
Someone's overcompensating.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.513
If you carried your weight,
I wouldn't have to.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.598
[George chuckles]

05:54.812 --> 05:57.690
The storm, you said it was alive.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.276
I was dehydrated.
You know, I was in shock.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.779
You saw that island appear out of nowhere.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.908
[inhales sharply] Yeah, that…
that one's a little harder to explain.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.495
These are the visions that led me here,
that led me to you, Richard.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.288
You're a part of this.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.336
[sighs] Thank you.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.256
Thank you for not letting me drown
in the middle of the ocean.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.759
-No, I mean that. I… I mean it. Thank you.
-[splutters]

06:24.842 --> 06:27.136
But I am not rowing with you

06:27.220 --> 06:30.139
to some island
that just mysteriously appeared…

06:30.223 --> 06:31.057
Okay, just--

06:31.140 --> 06:32.975
…out of goddamn thin air, all right?

06:33.059 --> 06:37.188
Because your… your visions
and your feelings are telling you to.

06:41.192 --> 06:44.654
You said you were on a voluntary mission
when your ship went down.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.408
What does that have to do with anything?

06:49.742 --> 06:53.162
Well, it means you're a man
who wants to make a difference,

06:54.288 --> 06:56.290
who wants his life to mean something.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.298
You… you have no idea

07:05.591 --> 07:07.844
what I lost when that ship went down.

07:12.014 --> 07:12.849
No.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.394
No, I… I… I don't.

07:21.482 --> 07:25.445
But I've learned
that there's a terrible gift to loss…

07:27.363 --> 07:29.198
which leaves nothing left to lose,

07:29.282 --> 07:32.285
which means you have everything to gain.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.252
Captain, your crew should stay
on the ship.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.795
[laughs]

07:42.879 --> 07:46.674
None of my men are witless enough
to go near that island, Mr. Sampson.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.843
We'll make it back as quick as we can.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.095
You have three days.

07:51.721 --> 07:55.683
After that, we return to Safi
with or without you.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.603
Three days.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.646
[Borges] Your sidearms.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.069
[crew speaking indistinctly]

08:12.158 --> 08:15.077
-[Richard] Still got room for one more?
-[Borges] Hold her steady.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.831
-Yeah, we could squeeze you in.
-You were wrong, you know?

08:19.624 --> 08:22.126
About us not having anything left to lose.

08:23.127 --> 08:26.172
We've still got our lives,
and they're in your hands now.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.927
[Borges] Check the engines again.
Make sure they're okay.

08:32.637 --> 08:33.513
Is that the last?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.268
Drop the lines. Let her go.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.480
-[Sheldon grunts]
-[indistinct chattering]

08:42.563 --> 08:44.732
[ominous music playing]

09:00.623 --> 09:02.124
[Chloe] I just saw her.

09:04.043 --> 09:04.919
I wasn't…

09:06.837 --> 09:08.589
I… I wasn't in a good place.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.926
We went out a couple times
back in junior high.

09:12.009 --> 09:12.969
[sighs]

09:14.220 --> 09:16.722
I had to listen to her sigh
about your tight little butt

09:16.806 --> 09:18.015
for two whole months.

09:18.099 --> 09:18.933
[both chuckle]

09:25.106 --> 09:26.732
You think this is because of me?

09:29.402 --> 09:31.279
Because of what I did to Blackstar?

09:35.908 --> 09:36.826
[Chloe sighs]

09:36.909 --> 09:39.328
You do the right thing, somebody dies.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.788
You do the wrong thing…

09:42.456 --> 09:44.041
somebody dies.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.460
But you have to make a choice.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.880
Otherwise, you're just standing by,
letting the world go.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.219
I couldn't live with myself if I did that.

10:01.892 --> 10:02.810
Oh. [chuckles]

10:04.312 --> 10:05.271
Shit.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.276
Maybe you'll be
the next Utopian after all.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.409
Hey, Chloe?

10:19.201 --> 10:20.995
You should come by more often

10:22.038 --> 10:23.372
when Mom and Dad are here.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.832
Don't hold your breath.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.889
But I'll… I'll think about it.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.021
[door opens]

10:49.273 --> 10:50.274
[door closes]

10:53.944 --> 10:54.862
[camera clicks]

10:55.821 --> 10:57.365
[ominous music playing]

10:58.658 --> 11:00.034
[wind howling]

11:03.954 --> 11:05.289
[indistinct chattering]

11:14.965 --> 11:16.050
[camera clicks]

11:19.887 --> 11:21.347
All right, Ulysses…

11:22.890 --> 11:23.724
where to?

11:25.768 --> 11:26.602
I don't know.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.452
Let's go.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.178
[footsteps echoing]

12:06.434 --> 12:07.727
[Grace sighs]

12:09.311 --> 12:11.230
[Sheldon] You mind telling me
what that was about?

12:12.106 --> 12:13.816
Seemed pretty self-explanatory.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.943
Oh, I guess I'm a little slow today.

12:16.026 --> 12:19.071
-The clock was ticking. I made a decision.
-[Sheldon] Yeah, and so did I.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.200
We've seen enough dissension lately.
You don't need to be adding to it.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.203
I didn't realize
that having an opposing view to yours

12:26.287 --> 12:27.788
was considered dissension now.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.666
The Union hasn't been this unstable
since Skyfox turned on us.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.586
You and I, especially,
need to show a united front.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.589
[Grace] No.

12:38.466 --> 12:39.550
I can't do that.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.261
Not when I disagree with you.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.681
I'm doing everything I can
to keep this thing from falling apart.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.099
[Grace] Well, it's not working.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.101
The Code is broken.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.312
The Code is not broken.
It's being challenged.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.565
No, it is broken
when Ghost Beam dies and Baryon lives.

12:54.648 --> 12:57.443
So what are you proposing?
That we just abandon the very values

12:57.526 --> 12:59.403
we built this whole thing on?
Throw it all away?

12:59.487 --> 13:02.406
I don't know! I just wanna be able
to talk about whatever this is right now!

13:02.490 --> 13:04.700
Discuss options! Try to fix it!

13:04.784 --> 13:07.036
We live in a different time!
It's not the 1930s anymore!

13:07.119 --> 13:09.038
That's why we need
to stick to the Code even more.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.998
The country needs it
right now more than ever.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.209
No, it's why you need it more than ever.

13:14.919 --> 13:15.753
[sighs]

13:16.337 --> 13:17.797
Please… [sighs]

13:18.756 --> 13:19.590
[sighs]

13:22.343 --> 13:25.012
You always said
that we had to uphold the Code

13:25.095 --> 13:27.807
because the alternative
would take free will away from the people.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.850
Yes, there would be consequences.

13:29.934 --> 13:33.604
Well, now you're taking it away yourself
by trying to control everything.

13:33.687 --> 13:35.940
Whose free will
am I trying to take away, exactly?

13:36.023 --> 13:39.527
-Brandon. Chloe.
-[Sheldon] They made their own choices.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.444
Me.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.908
And all those young supers,
those kids out there, they…

13:46.700 --> 13:51.121
they feel unheard,
like we don't have their back.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.124
They're scared, Sheldon.

13:54.208 --> 13:56.627
We're asking them
to blindly believe in something

13:56.710 --> 13:58.838
that doesn't make sense anymore.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.215
Is that how you feel?

14:04.677 --> 14:08.472
You know, when I was younger,
I… I spent my time asking questions,

14:08.556 --> 14:11.308
seeking the truth,
and somewhere along the way…

14:12.518 --> 14:13.435
[sighs]

14:14.395 --> 14:15.479
…I lost that.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.484
We made a lot of sacrifices,

14:20.568 --> 14:23.779
putting on these uniforms
and living this life.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.615
I will not make truth one of them,
not anymore.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.663
What do you want me to do?

14:34.623 --> 14:39.420
I just want you to listen,
really hear what people are saying,

14:40.337 --> 14:41.881
what they're afraid of,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.049
and then talk to them.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.762
Don't you remember the island

14:48.846 --> 14:51.307
and what we had to do
to earn these powers?

14:51.390 --> 14:53.225
That's what you need to do now.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.983
Grace, you have no idea what I need to do.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.828
[dramatic music playing]

15:21.086 --> 15:23.255
[Sheldon grunting]

15:32.056 --> 15:32.973
[Richard] Come on.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.768
It's like we're walking in place.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.604
The mountain's no closer
than when we started.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.106
We just have to… [coughs]
…keep up the pace.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.067
You're carrying too much.
Here, let me get that.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.527
Hey! Easy! It's all the supplies we got.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.863
Share the burden, princess.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.449
Good luck with that.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.160
Walt's never been one
to relinquish control.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.512
[eerie music playing]

16:15.683 --> 16:16.517
[panting]

16:29.446 --> 16:30.906
-Look at this.
-[Grace] What?

16:40.165 --> 16:43.544
It looks like it grew this way
from the inside out.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.089
We've seen these before.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.803
These are the patterns
that I've been seeing in my head.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.806
-Christ, Shel!
-It's what led me to… to… to Kansas.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.936
[Richard] Guys! Over here!

17:03.772 --> 17:04.606
[grunts]

17:05.357 --> 17:06.358
[shudders]

17:23.333 --> 17:24.376
Man alive!

17:27.337 --> 17:28.213
Back to the boat.

17:29.006 --> 17:29.840
Yeah.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.385
Wait, wait, wait, Walt. No, no, no, no--

17:33.469 --> 17:34.970
[Richard shouts, gasps]

17:35.054 --> 17:36.847
[all gasping, panting]

17:39.016 --> 17:43.187
[tree creaking]

17:53.072 --> 17:55.616
-[Grace shrieks]
-[all gasping]

17:55.699 --> 17:58.077
[Fitz] What the hell's going on? [grunts]

18:02.623 --> 18:04.541
[panting, gasps]

18:07.961 --> 18:09.755
The island won't let us leave.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.390
[knocking on door]

18:22.434 --> 18:24.186
-Hey.
-[Petra] Hey.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.567
I thought
you'd be helping Fitz and Walter.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.946
Yeah, I'm headed right back,
but I had to talk to you.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.534
What is it? [sighs]

18:41.453 --> 18:43.747
I'm thinking about leaving the Union.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.668
I've thought about it hard.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.796
Even talked to my dad.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.007
And what did he say?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.554
It was my decision.

19:02.891 --> 19:04.810
You can't leave the Union, not now.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.146
Look, I don't want to, but losing Janna--

19:07.229 --> 19:08.939
Petra, if you go, others will follow you.

19:09.022 --> 19:13.402
Your parents, Walter, you should see them.
I've never seen things so fractured.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.613
So that's why you need to stay.
This is when they need us most.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.074
I don't believe
in the Code anymore, Brandon.

19:23.954 --> 19:24.788
I'm sorry.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.042
No.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.546
[sighs]

19:35.591 --> 19:39.011
Look, I… I wish I could tell you
that I've never had any doubts…

19:42.639 --> 19:43.599
but I have.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.311
Especially over the last few days.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.607
And? How do you deal with it?

19:58.947 --> 20:02.993
I just remember
what my dad told me a long time ago.

20:06.288 --> 20:10.959
He said the Code
wasn't meant to make our lives easier.

20:12.336 --> 20:16.632
You have to care
about people, about this world.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.635
That's not easy to deal with sometimes,

20:19.718 --> 20:21.011
but what we do,

20:22.429 --> 20:24.223
it's never about the easy way out.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.184
That's what separates us

20:27.768 --> 20:29.645
from everyone else.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.983
[wind howling]

20:40.989 --> 20:43.158
[Sheldon panting]

20:43.242 --> 20:44.117
[Richard] Great.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.329
Can someone explain this to me?

20:47.412 --> 20:48.413
[Grace sighs]

20:51.500 --> 20:53.585
This place is messing with my head.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.628
Not just yours.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.423
Look…

21:00.634 --> 21:01.927
if we keep going,

21:03.262 --> 21:04.930
there has to be a way back.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.768
I'm sorry. Am I the only one
who saw these trees pop up out of nowhere

21:09.851 --> 21:11.103
when they tried to leave?

21:11.895 --> 21:13.897
It's like the island is alive.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.025
So… so, let's just rot here?

21:18.026 --> 21:19.361
That's your answer?

21:21.488 --> 21:23.323
Who's with Walter after what we just saw?

21:28.620 --> 21:29.579
Hmm.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.873
Well, looks like you're on your own, pal.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.333
-[whispers] Again.
-[grunts]

21:34.293 --> 21:36.712
[Sheldon] Look, hey,
we have to cross the desert.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.506
We've come this far.
We have to see what's out there.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.050
Yeah, and what exactly is that, Shel?
Your sanity?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.302
Maybe your sense of courage.

21:43.385 --> 21:44.761
-I don't know.
-Right. You don't.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.305
[grunts echoing]

21:46.388 --> 21:48.223
-[ringing sharply]
-[gasping]

21:51.393 --> 21:54.187
-I didn't ask for this.
-[Walter] No, of course you didn't.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.524
'Cause when's the last time
you had to ask for anything?

21:59.860 --> 22:00.694
Go.

22:02.404 --> 22:05.282
Go out there
and see how you fare on your own.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.535
I am tired of you questioning
every little thing that I do.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.538
Guess what, Walter? Not everything
works out exactly the way you want it to.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.415
[panting]

22:13.498 --> 22:15.917
Deal with it… for once.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.631
-Go on. Walk away, yeah. Walk away.
-[Walter] Give me the supplies.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.467
-Oh, no, no. Hey, wait, wait.
-I'm not asking.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.843
-[Grace] Hey, there's--
-Back off!

22:24.926 --> 22:28.347
I'm not asking, Fitz!
What, are you gonna stop me?

22:28.430 --> 22:31.725
-Wait! Wait, Walter.
-[panting]

22:32.976 --> 22:35.562
[Grace] Just… wait.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.024
[breathing shakily]

22:39.107 --> 22:40.150
Look at those trees.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.528
Look at that snow.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.031
[panting]

22:47.824 --> 22:48.867
He's right.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.163
We have to cross that desert.

23:03.006 --> 23:05.258
[classical piano music playing]

23:11.807 --> 23:13.558
[indistinct chattering over radio]

23:20.482 --> 23:21.525
[alert buzzes]

23:22.150 --> 23:23.485
[door whirs open]

23:29.574 --> 23:32.494
The hell you want?
This is just starting to get juicy.

23:32.577 --> 23:33.662
[music turns off]

23:34.162 --> 23:37.707
I wanted to give you a chance,
your last one.

23:39.292 --> 23:42.504
More intimidating if I knew
what the shit you were talking about.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.966
I'm gonna hack
into your dead copy's brain.

23:47.134 --> 23:50.762
By the end of the day,
I'll know everything.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.184
Real cocky, coming in here all alone.

23:56.810 --> 24:00.230
If you're involved in this,
if you're working with Skyfox--

24:00.313 --> 24:03.442
[scoffs] Skyfox? Oh, this
just keeps getting better and better.

24:03.525 --> 24:04.609
[Walter] Answer me.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.737
Are you in contact with George Hutchence?

24:07.821 --> 24:10.365
I wish. I always liked him better

24:10.449 --> 24:12.909
than the rest
of you long-underwear little shits.

24:12.993 --> 24:16.746
He took me out for drinks one time
after he busted up a job I was on.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.583
He saw right through
your self-righteous Code.

24:20.125 --> 24:24.254
He knew it was all bullshit
and Shelly's way of staying in control.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.131
Look how he ended up.

24:26.214 --> 24:28.758
Yeah, good old George may be on the lam,

24:29.718 --> 24:33.847
but at least he's honest with himself,
unlike the rest of the Union.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.184
I don't know
how you can live with yourselves.

24:37.267 --> 24:41.897
If I could, I'd find a way to expose
the Utopian for the fraud that he i--

24:41.980 --> 24:43.523
[ethereal tinkling]

24:45.609 --> 24:48.445
[Walter] I've just made
your brain forget how to breathe.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.446
[gasping]

24:56.661 --> 25:00.624
I'm gonna dig into your dead twin's mind.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.169
And if I don't find what I'm looking for,

25:04.878 --> 25:09.424
I'm coming back to dig into yours.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.261
And when I'm done,

25:14.638 --> 25:17.766
there will be nothing left.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.018
[gasps]

25:20.101 --> 25:21.728
[sinister music playing]

25:25.815 --> 25:26.816
[coughing]

25:29.819 --> 25:31.279
[panting]

25:31.363 --> 25:33.949
You think offing a copy of me was bad?

25:34.533 --> 25:38.286
Just wait to see what happens out there
when you do it to the real thing.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.206
I don't give a shit.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.250
I'm not my fucking brother.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.299
[all panting]

25:51.383 --> 25:52.717
[wind howling]

26:05.480 --> 26:07.857
[all panting]

26:08.900 --> 26:10.902
You're not seeing your dad again, are you?

26:11.528 --> 26:16.283
No. No, I haven't seen him since the boat.
I'm just trying to get my bearings here.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.743
-[Richard coughs]
-[Grace sighs]

26:19.452 --> 26:20.537
Why you?

26:21.204 --> 26:22.205
[Sheldon grunts]

26:23.081 --> 26:27.502
[Grace] Why did your father come to you…
[grunts] …and not Walt?

26:27.586 --> 26:30.714
-[George] I can think of several reasons.
-[Sheldon] I honestly don't know.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.800
[Walter] Yeah, you do, Shel.

26:35.635 --> 26:39.055
'Cause even though he's gone,
you're still the golden boy.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.975
[grunts] Your dad always was
a good judge of character.

26:42.058 --> 26:44.978
[Grace]
Just stop sniping at him all the time.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.229
I call it self-defense.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.773
I have opened myself up many times
to Walter.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.108
-Oh, please!
-What?

26:51.318 --> 26:54.988
The Rinsdale benefit, uh,
the… the… the party at… at Harry Lloyd's.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.449
No, you have rebuffed me
more times than I can possibly count.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.327
No, no, no, no.
You prefer to work alone, remember?

27:00.827 --> 27:04.289
[laughs] Says the man
who almost walked out on us!

27:05.081 --> 27:06.708
This is what he does, gang.

27:06.791 --> 27:11.504
This is what he does
when he doesn't feel heard.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.216
-When we were kids…
-Shut up!

27:15.300 --> 27:16.843
…he used to lock himself in a dark room.

27:16.926 --> 27:19.095
-[Sheldon] George.
-No. Remember that, Shel?

27:19.179 --> 27:21.723
Lock himself in a dark room.
Either that or he'd burst into tears.

27:21.806 --> 27:22.807
[Sheldon] George!

27:31.566 --> 27:33.276
[eerie music playing]

27:58.385 --> 28:00.053
[Fitz] Who would you choose if,

28:00.720 --> 28:05.016
you know, you could see someone again,
someone you lost?

28:07.018 --> 28:08.478
For me, it'd be my grandma.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.481
Smartest damn person I ever knew.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.567
[sighs] She got me reading books.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.278
Hell, taught me how to read.

28:18.863 --> 28:23.034
She loved everything about this world,
even when it didn't love her back.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.578
[Grace] My uncle.

28:26.621 --> 28:27.956
He was a photographer.

28:28.456 --> 28:29.541
Mostly birds.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.585
I hate birds. [chuckles]

28:33.086 --> 28:36.965
He died in the Second Battle of the Marne,
helping the French and the British

28:37.632 --> 28:40.093
four months before the war was over.

28:44.639 --> 28:48.518
Philip, another doctor, pediatrician.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.688
He loved kids,

28:52.272 --> 28:55.608
even when they were vomiting
and shitting all over him. [chuckles]

28:57.444 --> 29:00.613
He was on the ship with me
to Vila do Corvo. We were…

29:03.450 --> 29:05.994
We were friends
since before I can remember.

29:10.665 --> 29:11.583
My mother.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.672
I'd do anything to be able to say goodbye.

29:22.051 --> 29:24.804
Walt? What about you?

29:26.556 --> 29:27.432
No one.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.602
I don't live in the past.

29:31.269 --> 29:32.228
[panting]

29:37.525 --> 29:39.277
[ominous music playing]

29:44.657 --> 29:46.075
[wind howling]

29:55.418 --> 29:56.252
[Sheldon grunts]

29:56.336 --> 29:58.213
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

30:00.465 --> 30:01.382
[grunts]

30:03.885 --> 30:05.094
[gasping]

30:05.970 --> 30:06.805
[yells]

30:06.888 --> 30:08.556
Can anyone hear me?

30:10.600 --> 30:13.269
-[Richard] I can hear you!
-[Sheldon] Follow my voice!

30:14.521 --> 30:16.189
-All right.
-[yells]

30:16.272 --> 30:17.232
[Sheldon] Walter!

30:18.191 --> 30:19.275
I can't see!

30:19.359 --> 30:20.443
[Sheldon] George!

30:20.527 --> 30:23.029
-[George] Sheldon, I'm here! Grab my hand!
-[Sheldon] George!

30:23.112 --> 30:24.405
-Where's Grace?
-[George] Here.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.367
[Grace] I'm right here! Give me your hand!

30:27.867 --> 30:31.913
[Sheldon] All right,
everyone link arms. Link arms!

30:31.996 --> 30:32.914
[grunts]

30:34.040 --> 30:36.167
[grunts, coughs]

30:36.668 --> 30:38.753
We gotta keep pushing forward.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.517
[footsteps approaching]

31:02.485 --> 31:05.071
-Thanks for coming.
-Hmm. Don't get choked up.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.698
Job's a job.

31:08.283 --> 31:11.536
Digging the beard, big guy.
You got, like, a hot Santa thing going on.

31:11.619 --> 31:12.745
Don't do that.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.083
If you're trying to read my mind,
even Walt can't get in there.

31:17.166 --> 31:21.004
[scoffs] Don't need to read your mind
to know you've got a stick up your ass.

31:21.504 --> 31:22.338
Hello, Raikou.

31:22.422 --> 31:26.050
I would've charged by the hour if I knew
we were gonna engage in small talk.

31:26.134 --> 31:29.429
Don't push it.
He's barely tolerating you being here.

31:29.512 --> 31:31.180
Shit. I was hoping for an autograph.

31:31.264 --> 31:33.224
Just please keep quiet and do the job.

31:33.308 --> 31:35.310
Grace will have to manage you
if you get out of line.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.020
Oh, I'd love to see her try.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.105
-She's glad you're here.
-That makes one of us.

31:39.188 --> 31:40.690
I'm glad too.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.734
I heard about the job in Riyadh.

31:42.817 --> 31:46.362
Decapitating Cryptomorph
and still extracting his memories?

31:47.989 --> 31:49.949
I'm not even sure I could've done that.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.493
I'm damn good at what I do.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.915
Yeah. I know you are.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.417
-[Grace] Hey!
-[hands clap]

32:00.001 --> 32:02.587
Anything you two have to say
to each other, you say in front of us.

32:02.670 --> 32:03.588
Understood?

32:04.797 --> 32:06.925
She's sexy when she's giving orders.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.677
Aren't you the one
who knows when people are lying?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.930
Oh, I don't need powers
to know when you're full of shit.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.474
-[Walter] Raikou…
-All right, don't have a hemorrhage.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.144
-Can we do this, please?
-[Grace] Med bay's this way.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.939
Keep up, old man.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.275
[all panting, coughing]

32:39.207 --> 32:41.000
[Grace] I don't know
how we're crossing this.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.293
[panting]

32:44.003 --> 32:45.296
[grunting]

32:45.380 --> 32:46.422
Right here.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.174
[coughs, grunts]

32:48.257 --> 32:49.092
Follow me.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.451
[rocks sliding]

33:17.161 --> 33:18.955
[panting]

33:22.375 --> 33:23.543
[breathing shakily]

33:28.339 --> 33:29.882
[panting]

33:33.428 --> 33:36.347
Hey, Walt, was it… was it true
what you said earlier?

33:37.598 --> 33:38.433
[grunts]

33:38.516 --> 33:39.809
I said a lot of things.

33:39.892 --> 33:42.562
About me being Dad's golden boy.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.941
Why don't you focus on where you're going?

33:47.025 --> 33:49.027
You know, I always thought you were…

33:50.570 --> 33:54.198
you were Dad's favorite. I mean,
you're the one that got the good grades.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.909
You were his right-hand man
at the company.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.828
He just-- [breathing shakily]

33:58.911 --> 34:03.207
That's what someone looks for
in an employee, not a son.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.210
[Sheldon] You see,
that's your problem, Walt.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.046
You can't take a compliment.

34:08.129 --> 34:09.547
Everything is a slight.

34:10.256 --> 34:13.217
You know, maybe if you lightened up a bit,
George wouldn't be so hard on you.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.094
Don't even bring him into it!

34:16.554 --> 34:18.431
Exactly your problem, Walt.

34:21.184 --> 34:24.479
You wanna know…
[breathing shakily] …what my problem is?

34:25.563 --> 34:28.107
It's taking a back seat
to a younger brother

34:28.858 --> 34:31.486
who never deserved to have
the attention he received,

34:31.569 --> 34:34.113
who… who had everything handed to him,

34:34.614 --> 34:36.657
so he didn't have to fight for a scrap.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.869
You see, everything's…
it comes easy to you, Shel,

34:39.952 --> 34:42.955
'cause people always agree
with whatever you propose,

34:43.039 --> 34:46.709
like… like you're some kind of messiah.

34:46.793 --> 34:50.880
You snap your fingers, and people follow.

34:52.131 --> 34:54.092
You have no idea

34:55.093 --> 34:58.554
what it feels like
to have no one take you seriously,

34:58.638 --> 35:00.973
even when you know you're right.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.558
Walt, that's just not true. Come on.

35:02.642 --> 35:05.436
Dad would still be alive
if you'd listened to me!

35:05.520 --> 35:06.854
[gasping]

35:17.240 --> 35:18.449
[wind howling]

35:20.326 --> 35:22.245
[Walter] Dad… [sobbing]

35:23.454 --> 35:26.707
No. I told… I told you, Shel,

35:26.791 --> 35:29.293
that it wasn't time to expand the company.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.337
-And you…
-Walt.

35:32.755 --> 35:35.049
…you treated it like gossip.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.259
[sobbing]

35:36.342 --> 35:38.094
You ridiculed me.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.848
You didn't listen, Shel.

35:44.183 --> 35:46.769
You never listen.

35:50.690 --> 35:55.069
-Come on.
-No, no. Just… just… just keep moving!

36:02.326 --> 36:04.495
[all shouting]

36:04.579 --> 36:05.413
Walter!

36:05.496 --> 36:06.581

Oh my God.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.590
[grunting]

36:15.673 --> 36:17.049
Come on. There we go.

36:17.133 --> 36:17.967
[Walter panting]

36:19.427 --> 36:20.887
-[George] Oh God.
-[Sheldon] Come on.

36:32.815 --> 36:34.942
[ominous music playing]

36:57.089 --> 36:59.175
All right. That's the last one.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.806
[Fitz] Negative alpha. Negative beta.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.142
Negative theta. Negative delta.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.646
-Nobody home.
-That'll happen when you're dead.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.027
Are you sure about this?

37:19.612 --> 37:20.988
[Walter] Now you're asking?

37:22.698 --> 37:23.616
[sighs]

37:28.412 --> 37:30.331
[Sheldon] There has to be another way.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.415
There always is.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.418
Not this time.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.422
[Fitz] Okay, here we go. [sighs]

37:46.931 --> 37:48.808
Don't look directly into the light.

38:08.411 --> 38:09.453
[sighs]

38:09.537 --> 38:11.998
Well, that was disappointing.

38:12.581 --> 38:13.499
What happened?

38:13.582 --> 38:17.169
His system runs off antimatter.
That's a hell of a tank of gas.

38:17.253 --> 38:18.796
Hey, give me a boost, kiddo.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.590
See if we can jump-start
this bastard together.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.107
[Sheldon panting]

38:50.745 --> 38:52.121
What the hell is this?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.150
The clothing here looks Maori.

39:30.242 --> 39:31.827
These are Viking-era axes.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.962
These groups are
from different cultures and centuries.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.714
Yeah, but why are they here?

39:47.593 --> 39:48.552
Guys…

39:49.637 --> 39:51.389
We're not the first ones
to be invited here.

39:51.472 --> 39:54.308
-[blade rings]
-[Walter] Guys, look at this.

40:04.443 --> 40:05.486
This can't be it.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.865
There has to be a way through.

40:11.575 --> 40:12.618
[Walter] Sheldon.

40:13.285 --> 40:15.246
Sheldon! Listen to me!

40:15.329 --> 40:16.288
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

40:16.372 --> 40:18.916
-It is over!
-Hey! Walt! Drop the blade!

40:18.999 --> 40:22.545

41:12.386 --> 41:14.763
You… you did this!

41:14.847 --> 41:17.391
No. No, it's another… it's another test!

41:17.475 --> 41:18.309
[Fitz] No!

[panting] Stop.

41:58.557 --> 41:59.517
[gasping]

42:02.978 --> 42:03.979
Look at them.

42:04.647 --> 42:05.898
[panting]

42:06.941 --> 42:08.192
They killed each other.

42:09.777 --> 42:10.819
[gasps]

42:12.571 --> 42:14.198
This island is pitting…

42:16.116 --> 42:19.620
us against each other. It's testing us.

42:20.871 --> 42:22.289
I mean, think about it.

42:24.166 --> 42:30.005
All we've done since we got off
that goddamn boat is… fight.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.632
[Sheldon panting]

42:38.722 --> 42:39.807
[Grace] Look at them.

42:41.308 --> 42:42.518
Groups of six.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.105
They're just like us.

42:48.148 --> 42:49.066
But why?

42:53.946 --> 42:55.948
To see if we can overcome adversity

42:57.199 --> 42:58.075
together.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.329
That means there has to be…

43:03.789 --> 43:05.791
there has to be a way out of this.

43:19.471 --> 43:21.432
-What the hell was that?
-[Sheldon] Put it back.

43:21.515 --> 43:23.350
-What?
-[Sheldon] Put your hand back.

43:24.184 --> 43:25.352
Put it back!

43:26.729 --> 43:28.731
[ethereal chiming]

43:32.151 --> 43:33.152
My God.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.908
There's a reason we all had to be here.

43:40.409 --> 43:44.455
Grace, come on. Come here.
Fitz, Richard, Walter, come on.

43:57.259 --> 43:58.927
Walt. Come on.

43:59.762 --> 44:01.639
Come on. We need you.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.474
Ea…

44:05.100 --> 44:05.934
[Walter] What?

44:09.855 --> 44:12.775
-It's not working. It's not working.
-[Sheldon] No, no, no. It's gotta work.

44:12.858 --> 44:14.026
It has to work.

44:14.109 --> 44:16.779
We've come this far.
We've come this far together.

44:17.946 --> 44:18.822
Together.

44:20.658 --> 44:23.410
Walter, George,
you guys gotta put everything aside.

44:25.871 --> 44:27.289
You gotta let things go.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.021
No.

44:51.105 --> 44:52.147
[panting]

44:52.731 --> 44:53.565
No.

44:57.611 --> 44:59.863
[Grace] It's not just
about George and Walter.

45:01.907 --> 45:03.951
It's about you and Walter too.

46:48.806 --> 46:51.767
He's spiking across the board,
but it's random, unstable.

46:51.850 --> 46:54.853
Whatever you're gonna do,
you best get to it.

46:55.854 --> 46:57.856
He could flatline at any moment.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.694
Give me your hand.

47:03.320 --> 47:04.863
I should've charged you more.

Oh, the path I took last time,
it's closed.

It's collapsed.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.140
No, wait.

47:33.308 --> 47:34.142
There.

Raikou, do something!

I am. I'm keeping the door
to Blackstar's mind open.

No, not you. Not now.

50:24.312 --> 50:25.522
Get out of my head.

50:25.605 --> 50:27.274
No, no. Wait, Shel.

50:30.027 --> 50:31.111
