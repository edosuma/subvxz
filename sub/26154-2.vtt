-[sad music playing]

00:25.817 --> 00:27.819
[car tires squeaking]

00:29.571 --> 00:31.573
[crying continues]

00:45.045 --> 00:48.840
I need to get as far away
from Los Angeles as possible.

00:48.923 --> 00:52.469
The handy ticketing screens are behind you
and will provide all the answers you need.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.888
-Can't you just help me?
-Screen has all the answers.

00:54.971 --> 00:58.641
[sighs] I could really use
some personal attention right now.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.561
-Where did you want to go?
-I need to leave tonight. Anywhere.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.064
Uh, okay. Hanoi?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.941
Vietnam! Yes, perfect!
Thank you!

01:08.651 --> 01:11.738
-Sh-should I punch it into that screen?
-Uh-huh.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.824
And say nice things about me.
That screen's my supervisor.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.285
[theme music playing]

02:14.634 --> 02:17.345
-[phone vibrating]
-I'm Peter Sagal. Don't wait, wait.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.931
-Do answer your phone.
-Stefani?

02:20.014 --> 02:23.351
Hey, girl! Just checking up on that
clickable content you were working on.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.062
Listen, something came up, and I--
Where are you?

02:26.146 --> 02:29.566
I'm doing a new, fully immersive,
3-D spin class.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.443
[chuckles] Oh, you know what?
I'm just biking.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.196
-Oh. Well, I just landed in Vietnam...
-[growls]

02:35.280 --> 02:38.074
-Where is my content, Diane?
-Um...

02:38.158 --> 02:40.451
I need words for my website.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.121
There are words on the website now,
but I need younger words,

02:43.204 --> 02:46.791
newer words, fresher words
to feed the insatiable beast!

02:46.875 --> 02:49.043
Okay, okay, I'll write something
while I'm here.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.547
-Love it! Feed that beast, girl! Bye!
-[phone beeps]

02:52.630 --> 02:54.716
[indistinct chattering in Vietnamese]

02:54.799 --> 02:56.593
[Diane reading]

02:59.929 --> 03:02.891
Number one: To reconnect
with your ancestral roots.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.935
As a born and raised American,

03:06.019 --> 03:09.063
you never felt much connection
to your Vietnamese heritage,

03:09.522 --> 03:12.233
and your parents offered little
to fill in the blanks.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.320
G'aw! You call that a fastball?

03:15.403 --> 03:19.115
With an arm like that, you're gonna get
booted back to Triple-A, you skeezer!

03:19.199 --> 03:22.035
-Dad, where are we from?
-We're from Boston, dummy!

03:22.118 --> 03:24.746
Why do you think I talk
in this accurate, regional dialect?

03:24.829 --> 03:27.916
I know that, but, I mean,
what is our background?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.918
Why do I look different
from the other kids?

03:30.001 --> 03:32.212
Ah, shove it up your rear, you jack-off.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.798
You're just the same as anybody else,
and don't let nobody tell you different.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.384
I just thought you could give me
a little cultural context,

03:38.468 --> 03:41.721
what with you being a tenured professor
of Vietnamese history at Tufts and all.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.598
Christ, Deedee, that's my job.

03:43.681 --> 03:46.184
I wouldn't ask you to have a period
on your day off.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.603
What? Dad, it-- Okay.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.148
[Diane]  But you're here, finally.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.567
And it's comforting
to see your name everywhere

03:54.651 --> 03:56.819
and so many faces,
that look like your face.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.780
-Ah! Oh.
-[speaking Vietnamese]

03:58.863 --> 04:01.074
-Sorry, I don't-- I don't speak...
-[speaking Vietnamese]

04:01.157 --> 04:04.035
-I don't... I don't understand you.
-[speaking Vietnamese]

04:05.453 --> 04:07.121
Oh, is this who you were looking for?

04:07.205 --> 04:08.748
-Ouch!
-[speaking Vietnamese]

04:10.667 --> 04:11.834
I'm sorry.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.755
[Diane]  It's more foreign
than you expected, but that's good.

04:16.214 --> 04:20.843
You want to truly immerse yourself
and get the full non-LA experience.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.428
-[bike bell rings]
-Ooh!

04:28.017 --> 04:29.978
Because sometimes, to find yourself,

04:30.186 --> 04:32.397
you need to get as far away
from the world you know--

04:32.480 --> 04:34.148
-Coming through! Hot set!
-Ah! Ah!

04:34.232 --> 04:35.149
[man] Movie lingo!

04:35.233 --> 04:37.610
-[sighs] Excuse me, hi.
-[bell dings]

04:37.694 --> 04:40.071
-What's going on here?
-Oh, isn't it exciting?

04:40.238 --> 04:43.616
Some American filmmakers are shooting
a movie, starring Laura Linney!

04:43.700 --> 04:47.412
It's about a recently-divorced woman
who comes to Vietnam to find herself.

04:48.037 --> 04:48.871
[sighs]

04:51.791 --> 04:54.002
[Diane]  You came here
to reconnect with your roots,

04:54.085 --> 04:57.714
but now you feel stupid
for even thinking that was possible.

04:57.797 --> 05:02.176
You put on the clothing you bought,
and... it... feels like a costume.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.596
This is not your home.
You're a tourist here.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.809
Reason number two:
you can be a tourist here!

05:10.643 --> 05:13.229
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[both speaking Vietnamese]

05:13.479 --> 05:14.939
Can I have number two?

05:15.690 --> 05:18.359
-Number two?
-Ah. Yes.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.237
[speaking Vietnamese]
Number two.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.698
Thank you. [speaking Vietnamese]
[laughs]

05:24.157 --> 05:24.991
[speaking Vietnamese]

05:25.742 --> 05:26.909
[speaking Vietnamese]

05:27.410 --> 05:29.912
[speaking Vietnamese] Thank you.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.959
[Diane]  Sometimes,
it's just nice to take a vacation

05:35.126 --> 05:37.128
and forget
about everything you left behind...

05:37.211 --> 05:39.505
-[phone vibrates]
-I'm Peter Sagal. Don't wait, wait.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.423
-[beeps]
-Hello?

05:40.506 --> 05:43.051
-Diane!
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.553
Are you okay?
You left my party without saying goodbye.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.638
I was like,
"Uh-oh, what happened to Diane?"

05:47.722 --> 05:48.890
-Well--
-Then I got distracted

05:48.973 --> 05:51.100
because Todd got his tongue stuck
to the ice sculpture.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.352
By the time we got him off,

05:52.435 --> 05:55.355
his tongue was completely numb,
which made him talk real funny.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.774
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, that got him in quite the situation

05:57.857 --> 05:59.400
when the mob boss, at the roller rink,

05:59.484 --> 06:01.527
thought he was making fun
of his deaf sister.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.696
I'm sorry,
this is turning into a Todd story.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.239
The point is, are you okay?

06:05.323 --> 06:06.783
Oh, yeah, sorry.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.036
[stammers] I just had a plane to catch,
so... I'm in Vietnam now...

06:10.119 --> 06:12.372
-Whoa.
-...but... I'll be back soon.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.749
-Let me fetch you from the airport.
-[bike bell rings]

06:15.416 --> 06:18.044
Oh, that's okay.
You don't want to deal with the traffic.

06:18.127 --> 06:19.712
You know I love traffic.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.132
I get to catch up on all those hilarious
license plates I haven't read yet.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.675
Okay. Thanks.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.345
Great. Hey, I have to tell you...

06:27.470 --> 06:29.972
I'm glad, I'm not still paying
your phone bill

06:30.056 --> 06:32.308
because this call
must be costing a fortune!

06:32.392 --> 06:34.685
Unless you remembered to call Ed
for the international plan.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.438
Of course I remembered to do that!
But I have to hang up now.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.857
Our conversation has reached
a natural conclusion, goodbye.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.567
-[phone beeps]
-Ugh.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.237
Number three:
because you're single now

06:44.320 --> 06:46.072
and you can do whatever you want.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.366
Isn't it great being single?

06:48.783 --> 06:50.076
[chuckles] It sure is!

06:50.159 --> 06:53.037
I love that we're mature enough
to still be in each other's lives.

06:53.121 --> 06:53.955
I know!

06:54.038 --> 06:56.749
Other divorced couples can't handle it,
but we're handling it, so well,

06:56.833 --> 06:58.167
because we are better than them.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.378
Are we the best divorced couple?

07:00.461 --> 07:02.296
-I think we might be.
-Yeah.

07:03.714 --> 07:06.175
How are you doing
with those divorce papers?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.803
-It's been several weeks now-- Aah!
-Hi, folks! I'm Pickles.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.721
-Ooh!
-Have you dined with us before?

07:10.805 --> 07:11.931
-Yes.
-Well...

07:12.014 --> 07:14.434
the way it works around here is:
you look at a menu,

07:14.517 --> 07:17.353
pick what you want, I'll bring it to you,
and then you pay at the end.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.813
So, like, a restaurant.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.482
-Ooh, sounds great.
-Can I get you started with drinks?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.483
Water would be great.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.318
-Oh, my God, I love water.
-Me, too!

07:24.402 --> 07:26.070
-Uh-huh.
-I'm 70 percent water!

07:26.154 --> 07:28.114
-Okay.
-Me, too! What are the odds?

07:28.197 --> 07:30.408
So, two waters. Thank you.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.829
So... Mr. Peanutbutter,
the divorce papers.

07:34.912 --> 07:37.248
-We need to-- Aah!
-It's me again, the same dog as before.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.418
-Do you know what you'd like to order?
-Are you bringing our waters?

07:40.501 --> 07:43.963
-No. I forgot. Food, though?
-Hmm, what do you like here?

07:44.046 --> 07:46.257
-No, why would you ask--
-Oh, I like everything.

07:46.340 --> 07:49.635
In fact, at the end of my shift,
I usually take everyone's leftover scraps

07:49.719 --> 07:52.221
and put it in a trough and eat it up.
Miam, miam, miam, miam!

07:52.305 --> 07:54.307
-But don't mention that to my boss.
-We won't.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.809
But that does sound eclectic
and delectable.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.186
The trough of everything.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.564
-Okay, and--
-Whoa, somebody's not hungry at all.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.609
-No, I am! I'm very hungry!
-[laughs]

08:04.984 --> 08:07.069
[shouting] And I'll have the Cobb salad!

08:07.528 --> 08:10.031
-Why do you keep humoring her?
-She's fun.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.949
You know, if we were still married,

08:12.033 --> 08:14.744
this would probably be enough
to spiral us off into a big argument,

08:14.827 --> 08:17.663
that isn't even about the waitress,
and we would fight all night.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.625
But since we're not married,
I can just be like, whatever.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.711
-This is truly great.
-So... great.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.963
We are doing so great.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.423
Although...

08:27.798 --> 08:31.802
I do get lonely sometimes
in that big house all by myself.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.263
Hey, why don't you have
a housewarming party?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.057
-Eh...
-Yeah!

08:36.140 --> 08:38.809
Now that you don't have a mean wife
who hates parties...

08:38.893 --> 08:40.228
He-he, you can finally live it up.

08:40.311 --> 08:43.189
Okay, but only if you come.
Promise?

08:43.272 --> 08:45.942
I'll come if you have
those divorce papers.

08:46.025 --> 08:46.859
-Aah!
-Me again.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.986
What did you order?
I didn't write it down.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.196
-The trough!
-Oh!

08:50.279 --> 08:52.031
He wants the trough!

08:56.786 --> 09:01.916
Uh,  xin... loi.
Do you speak any English?

09:01.999 --> 09:04.502
We... are... lost.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.128
I actually speak all of the English.

09:06.212 --> 09:12.718
-Oh! Your English... is very good.
-I... am... American.

09:12.802 --> 09:18.266
Yes. American.
We... are.... from... America.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.560
I...  am... from America.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.814
No. Me America. You Vietnam.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.066
No. Me America.

09:27.149 --> 09:31.487
-Me America!
-Me America, too.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.240
Me am also America.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.118
[Diane]  Number four:
To meet new people!

09:39.245 --> 09:42.582
-Hell-oh, uh, I am with the movie.
-[music playing]

09:42.915 --> 09:45.751
No Vietnamese, but I want a drink.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.086
Beer?

09:47.753 --> 09:48.588
Glug-glug?

09:50.965 --> 09:53.759
[Diane]  Number five:
Get out of your natural habitat.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.598
We all work so hard
to cultivate our homes,

09:58.681 --> 10:01.892
but what are they other than a place
to repeat negative patterns?

10:01.976 --> 10:04.186
There. Last one.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.605
And the first one.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.232
I moved all this other stuff in
while you were... stretching.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.358
So much for helping.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.612
Oh, did you need help deciding
whether or not this place is a shithole?

10:12.695 --> 10:13.779
Because help is on the way.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.157
-It's a shithole.
-I like it.

10:16.282 --> 10:19.201
It's what I can afford and it makes me
feel good to do it on my own.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.829
When this place makes you too sad,
you can always come over.

10:21.912 --> 10:25.082
You'll have to say, "I'm a sad, sad girl
with a terrible, dirty apartment,"

10:25.166 --> 10:28.336
-but I'll let you crash.
-This is my home and I am proud of it.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.422
-Where did you get all this junk?
-It's not junk!

10:31.505 --> 10:33.132
I just emptied out my storage unit.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.010
This is the stuff that cool,
20-something Diane had to put away

10:36.093 --> 10:38.137
when she moved in
with old man Peanutbutter.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.473
Oh, can we finally talk shit
about Mr. Peanutbutter?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.225
Like how he has dog breath
and leaves his hair all over,

10:43.309 --> 10:46.354
or is this one of those scam jobs
where I talk shit

10:46.437 --> 10:48.439
and you nod along,
then you two get back together

10:48.522 --> 10:50.274
and you hate me
because I told you how I felt?

10:50.358 --> 10:53.903
When have you not told me how you felt?
All you do is tell me how you really feel.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.738
This place smells weird.
I want to go home.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.281
-I don't tell you everything.
-You do.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.367
There's literally nothing
you haven't told me.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.994
Well, did I tell you
this place smells weird?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.579
Yes. Help me move this couch.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.748
Okay, you get started.
I'm gonna stretch first.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.042
Anyway, Mr. Peanutbutter
and I are still good friends.

11:08.125 --> 11:08.959
Get the hammies.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.545
I'm going to his housewarming party
on Saturday. You should come.

was called "Bruce."

Talking about Demi Moore?

You know I can't divulge personal
information about my other clients, Diane.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.965
I'll ask you to be respectful.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.384
-But she and her second husband...
-Ashton.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.053
I cannot say, went on a trip,

15:29.136 --> 15:32.640
and getting out of her routine allowed her
to process things more honestly.

I just feel, like,
I see myself very clearly already.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.187

with my decision.

Angelina J,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.776
who has a lot of adopted kids--

15:43.859 --> 15:44.735
Is she an actress?

15:44.818 --> 15:46.278
As a matter of fact, no.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.447
She thinks of herself as a director.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.575

in your sessions with other clients?

16:58.225 --> 16:59.810
about his life in America,

he thinks you are,

this person who isn't bound
by her own history or sadness.

You were just pretending this whole time?

I was actually feeling
something special here.

18:12.299 --> 18:15.636
Really? It didn't strike you as weird
that you talked for two hours straight

18:15.719 --> 18:16.720
and I said nothing?

18:16.804 --> 18:18.514
Or is that what felt special?

I am not the bad guy here.
You're a liar!

to get out of your routine.

It was mostly me who thought it,
but my therapist also... [sighs]

-Ta da!
-Did you get a longer neck or something?

19:19.616 --> 19:22.202

20:53.710 --> 20:56.713
It really brings out the neck
of your... neck.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.423
Okay, well, that's--

20:58.507 --> 21:01.551
Hey, don't go anywhere, okay?
I want to talk to you.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.887
-Oh. [chuckles] How was--
-Erica!

21:03.971 --> 21:06.223
What are you doing here
with a child-sized coffin?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.266
[sighs]

21:07.349 --> 21:10.769
Oh, my God, are you okay?
I saw everything.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.062
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.772
I can't pick sides in this divorce

21:13.855 --> 21:15.816
because I'm good friends
with the both of you,

21:15.899 --> 21:20.320
but I want you to know, no matter what,
I'm here for you and also there for him.

21:20.404 --> 21:23.073
And if you ever need anything,
just let me know

21:23.156 --> 21:25.909
and I'll be your rock,
as long as it doesn't conflict with me

21:25.993 --> 21:28.996
also being Mr. Peanutbutter's rock,
or my work,

21:29.079 --> 21:30.580
which is keeping me very busy.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.249
Excuse me, I have to take this.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.419
Hi, Flip? Yeah, are we sure
we need this strip club set?

21:35.794 --> 21:39.214
Because once we put the deposit down,
we cannot get that money back.

21:39.381 --> 21:42.092
-[dance music continuous]
-[people chatting]

21:47.681 --> 21:48.598
[sighs]

21:49.308 --> 21:51.226
[Diane]  Reason number ten
to go to Vietnam:

21:51.393 --> 21:53.478
Because you've gotta leave
to come back home.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.481
-[phone beeps]
-[line ringing]

21:57.357 --> 21:59.276
-[BoJack]  Hello?
-Hey.

21:59.735 --> 22:00.652
-Hey.
-[sad tune]

22:00.777 --> 22:05.490
I'm sorry. I've been so weird.
I'm going through some shit.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.783
I know.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.454
Yeah. And I just really need
a friend right now.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.164
You know what I mean?

22:12.581 --> 22:13.415
A friend?

22:13.665 --> 22:15.250
Yeah. I get it.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.586
Okay. Thanks.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.422
-This is Diane, by the way.
-Nguyen?

22:20.589 --> 22:23.258
-Yeah. Nguyen.
-[phone beeps]

22:23.342 --> 22:26.261
[Diane]  You're not entirely sure
what life will be like when you get home,

22:26.345 --> 22:30.432
but maybe that's good
because that means anything could happen.

22:31.183 --> 22:35.062
-Oh, my God, you're Laura Linney!
-People say that to me all the time.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.606
And it's true.
I am Laura Linney.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.649
I'm so sorry to bother you,
but I have to ask,

22:39.733 --> 22:42.194
the movie you were filming,
what happens at the end?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.988
You get divorced, you go to Vietnam
to find yourself, but then what?

22:45.072 --> 22:46.031
How does it work out?

22:46.114 --> 22:48.116
-Well, I do find myself.
-Oh.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.451
-My clone.
-Oh.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.912
-And she's shacked up with my ex.
-Hmm?

22:51.995 --> 22:55.123
I fly into a jealous rage
and gut him with a machete,

22:55.207 --> 22:56.958
but not before realizing
that this whole thing

22:57.042 --> 22:58.460
goes all the way to the top.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.463
So me and my clone have to team up
and head to Dubai.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.132
A lot of it is setting up the franchise.
You know how it is.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.219
-Um... it's an action movie?
-And a love story.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.471
Me and my clone
have a steamy make-out scene,

23:09.554 --> 23:12.599
-which is hot but also very progressive.
-[PA system beeps]

23:12.682 --> 23:15.018
Excuse me. Can I get some pretzels?
I'm Laura Linney.

23:15.102 --> 23:19.106
[Diane]  But none of those reasons
are why you actually went to Vietnam.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.942
[plane taking off]

23:22.275 --> 23:23.443
Hey, stranger.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.654
-[joyful tune]
-[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles]

23:25.987 --> 23:28.073
Yeah, so, if it all looks good to you
and your lawyer,

23:28.156 --> 23:30.575
you can sign it, too,
and then it'll be official.

23:30.659 --> 23:33.203
-Divorce completed.
-Yay!

23:33.286 --> 23:36.706
-We did it.
-Take that, our marriage!

23:37.666 --> 23:40.919
-Well, I guess I'll see you around?
-Yeah.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.505
-Oh! I was going for the--
-Oh, sorry. Did you--?

23:43.588 --> 23:45.298
-[laughs]
-Sorry. Just go all the way.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.842
-Well, bye.
-Cool.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.430
Diane, wait.
I actually have something to tell you.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.058
I... don't know the best way
to say this, but...

23:55.767 --> 23:56.768
I'm seeing someone.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.186
Romantically.

23:58.854 --> 23:59.771
Who isn't you.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.691
That was probably
not the best way to say it.

24:03.608 --> 24:04.734
[dance music playing]

24:04.818 --> 24:05.986
So, as I was saying,

24:06.069 --> 24:08.238
being there for you right now
is my top pri--

24:08.321 --> 24:10.407
-[phone vibrates, beeps]
-Oh. Hold on. Stuart!

24:10.699 --> 24:15.704
There's a fire extinguisher under my desk.
Oh, that's what's on fire? In that case...

24:17.497 --> 24:20.167
[Diane]  The real reason
you go to Vietnam

24:20.250 --> 24:23.211
is because you accidentally see
your soon-to-be ex-husband

24:23.295 --> 24:24.588
kiss someone else.

24:24.671 --> 24:25.672
[both chuckle]

24:25.881 --> 24:29.801
At first you think, "Oh, it's a fling.
Whatever, they're drunk, it's a party."

24:30.427 --> 24:31.303
[sad tune]

24:31.428 --> 24:33.138
But he puts his hand
on the small of her back

24:33.221 --> 24:35.765
exactly the way he used to do to you.

24:35.849 --> 24:36.683
[both] Mmm.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.728
-It means "I've got you,"
-[sad tunes continue]

24:40.145 --> 24:42.814
and when he did it to you,
it made you feel safe.

24:43.398 --> 24:46.693
And you realize
he will never do that to you again.

24:48.528 --> 24:50.864
-[crying]
-And it breaks your heart, again...

24:51.823 --> 24:53.825
after your heart was so broken
that you thought

24:53.909 --> 24:56.077
it could never get any more broken.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.038
You thought it was safe,

24:58.872 --> 25:01.291
but it still, somehow,
finds a new way to break.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.836
Because, even though,
you're the one who asked for this,

25:05.587 --> 25:08.423
now that you've got it,
you are completely adrift

25:09.257 --> 25:13.637
with no compass, or map,
or sense of where to go, or what to do.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.097
So you go to Vietnam.

25:17.307 --> 25:21.770
You think you might find community,
a connection to something bigger,

25:21.853 --> 25:23.230
but... you don't.

25:23.813 --> 25:27.692
In fact, you feel even more alone
than you were before you left.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.570
But... you survive.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.864
[sad tunes continue]

25:33.490 --> 25:35.784
You learn that you can survive
being alone.

25:35.992 --> 25:39.204
[sad tunes intense]

25:39.329 --> 25:40.163
[sighs]

25:40.830 --> 25:42.958
I'm really happy for you,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.751
[night crickets]

25:45.335 --> 25:48.129
[singing in Vietnamese]
