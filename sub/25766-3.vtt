WEBVTT

00:08.342 --> 00:09.753
He's trying to...

00:09.885 --> 00:11.877
run away!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.719
Super!
Run away!

00:13.847 --> 00:14.883
Aaaah!

00:15.015 --> 00:16.326
- I'm with you, kid!
- I heard <i>that!</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:17.470
All right,
you heard the man!

00:17.559 --> 00:19.892
This is an evacuation, people!

00:20.020 --> 00:23.639
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:23.774 --> 00:25.140
White! White!
Come on!

00:25.275 --> 00:27.392
Get the hell up!
We got to get out of here!

00:27.528 --> 00:29.144
Dad! Dad?

00:29.279 --> 00:31.020
If that really is you, stop!

00:31.156 --> 00:33.489
Listen to me!
You are not a building.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.358
<i>Doc! Doc!
Come in, Doc!</i>

00:35.494 --> 00:37.486
What the hell's going on
down there?

00:37.621 --> 00:40.159
<i>Uh, where do you
want me to start?</i>

00:40.749 --> 00:42.365
Huh?

00:44.920 --> 00:48.004
Dude!
It's the Morphomobile!

00:48.131 --> 00:49.400
The Blue Morpho?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.424
How is that possible?

00:50.509 --> 00:54.173
Oh, who fucking cares?!
I'm out of the doghouse!

00:54.304 --> 00:55.532
<i>Attention, Blue Morpho!</i>

00:55.556 --> 00:56.592
Oh, shit!
They found me!

00:56.723 --> 00:58.259
<i>You are surrounded.</i>

00:58.392 --> 01:01.260
<i>Come out at once
with your hands up</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:03.261
<i>and face Guild justice.</i>

01:07.067 --> 01:08.649
Hunter, I need backup!

01:08.777 --> 01:10.518
Ven-Tech's under siege
or something!

01:10.654 --> 01:12.395
No can do, sunshine.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.193
Had a major breach down
at Dummy Corp.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.044
<i>All available agents are
currently assisting</i>

01:16.159 --> 01:17.159
<i>other customers.</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:18.405
Damn it!

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.797 --> 01:30.288
No way.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.710
Uh...

01:31.842 --> 01:32.842
Who's that, now?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.384
It's the Blue Morpho!

01:39.516 --> 01:41.758
He's come to rescue us!
Wait.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.681
Holy cats!
Is that...

01:44.813 --> 01:47.021
No.
It cannot be.

01:50.819 --> 01:54.483
Jonas Venture, where are you?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.328
Hello? Galacticon?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.913
Are you in here?

02:04.041 --> 02:06.579
Gasp!
It <i>is</i> true!

02:06.710 --> 02:08.667
Ow!

02:10.380 --> 02:13.964
Shore Leave, get ready.
We're going.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.180
Newark.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.309
My home is in Newark.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.204
Hello.

02:43.246 --> 02:45.454
Honey, I am home.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.823
Darling?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.824
Aren't you coming to bed?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.792
In a while, dearest.

02:50.921 --> 02:54.380
I've got some
work to do in my study.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.482
Hurry, Kano!
Killer Drone has struck again!

03:16.613 --> 03:20.323
It's up to the Blue Morpho
to stop him!

03:22.577 --> 03:23.577
Blue Morpho.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.699
Blue. Morpho.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.289
You <i>are</i> the Blue Morpho.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.910
I <i>am</i> the Blue Morpho.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.633
Please, Signore Morpho,
I work as-a fast as I can.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.761
Hurry, Enzo.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.758
Killer Drone is still
on the loose.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.312
Jonas Venture,
where are you?

04:02.659 --> 04:03.945
I see.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.490
Progressive Biological
Life Extension Module.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.738
Stand by.

04:13.670 --> 04:16.708
Can someone tell me
what the fuck just happened?!

04:16.839 --> 04:18.547
Shit!

04:20.469 --> 04:21.926
Aaaah...

04:24.139 --> 04:28.554
<i>♪ I still hang around ♪</i>

04:30.604 --> 04:32.846
<i>- ♪ Neither lost nor found ♪</i>
- Welcome, old friend.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.598
I wasn't expecting <i>you</i>
to come to my rescue.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.521
Negative.
Have not come for rescue.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.439
Seek Jonas Venture
assistance.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.029
Memory fragmented.
I am confused.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.819
Hmm.
You look it.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.361
However did you find me?

04:45.494 --> 04:47.360
Looked Jonas Venture up
in phone book.

04:47.496 --> 04:50.239
Acquiring phone book
was most difficult part.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.950
Can't seem to get that darn song
out of my head.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.452
- "Street Life" by the Crusaders.
- I know.

04:56.588 --> 05:00.457
It's the last thing I remember
before the darkness.

05:00.592 --> 05:02.504
I've no idea
how long I was out.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.674
But one fateful day,
I awoke.

05:05.806 --> 05:10.301
I was unable to move or speak,
but I could see and hear.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.724
<i>- It's on.
- It's off.</i>

05:13.855 --> 05:14.855
<i>- It's on.
- Off.</i>

05:14.856 --> 05:16.518
I tried to communicate
with them.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.142
They mustn't teach the cadets
Morse code anymore.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.065
Soon the blackness
came for me again.

05:22.197 --> 05:25.235
But I knew I was on Gargantua-1.
I built her.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.108
I could communicate with her!

05:28.245 --> 05:31.784
We had a miscommunication.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.498
I was alone, disconnected,

05:34.626 --> 05:36.618
forced to forage for protein

05:36.753 --> 05:38.995
as my backup battery
slowly died.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.918
Until a savior brought me here.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.666
<i>I know the perfect
place for it!</i>

05:43.802 --> 05:45.363
Wouldn't think
an office building would have

05:45.387 --> 05:47.595
more complex hardware
than a space station,

05:47.722 --> 05:49.679
but it's taken over a year
to learn its systems.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.972
And then this blasted albino
came out of nowhere.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.641
I think they're talking
to each other.

05:55.772 --> 05:56.888
What is this, SCSI?

05:57.023 --> 05:59.811
I sense great confusion.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.479
Yeah, you're sensing that
from me.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.102
Anger. Betrayal.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.238
Also me.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.481
You people really need
to start explaining.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.074
You know this, uh, thing?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.410
Course.
That's the Blue Morpho.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.746
You told me
the Blue Morpho died.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.332
He did.
Plane crash took him in '76.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.998
Yeah, but your father was having
none of that.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.747
I call him Venturion.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.419
I call him
an abomination.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.793
You've gone too far
this time, Jonas.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.114
I thought you'd all
be pleased.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.845
I saved our friend's life.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.885
Yeah, but what kind of life
is this?

06:32.017 --> 06:33.929
Nah.
This is just wrong.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.722
W-What part of
"I just performed

06:35.854 --> 06:37.641
the most amazing feat
of super science"

06:37.772 --> 06:38.979
are you people
not getting?

06:39.107 --> 06:40.598
But you know Jonas.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.815
Within a few months,

06:41.943 --> 06:44.310
he'd lost interest
in his new toy.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.569
Then one day,
he just snapped.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.660
Error.
Stand by.

06:57.208 --> 06:57.833
Memories...

07:01.254 --> 07:02.961
No. No.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.170
No.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.915
- Dad?!
- No. No.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.543
- Help!
- No. No.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.920
Error. Synapse.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.844
Poor ol' Kano
had to put him down.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.932
Hasn't spoken a word since.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.053
<i>Doc? Doc?!</i>

07:18.188 --> 07:19.724
<i>Everybody okay
in there?</i>

07:19.856 --> 07:20.937
Door's blocked.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.557
Can't get in.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.150
Can you open
the security gates?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.315
<i>Uh, you'd have
to ask my dad.</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:28.779
Your dad? Wh...

07:28.907 --> 07:30.318
Aw, shit.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.611
What do you people want?

07:32.827 --> 07:34.238
You two stay out of sight.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.907
I'll find out
what's going on.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.530
Oh, what,
are you kidding me?

07:37.666 --> 07:38.782
I want in on this too.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.317
Look what you're wearing,
you idiot.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.869
Good point.
We'll, uh, hang back.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.041
"Good point.
We'll hang back."

07:45.173 --> 07:47.165
We demand entry
this instant!

07:47.300 --> 07:48.916
You are harboring
a fugitive

07:49.052 --> 07:51.385
from Guild of
Calamitous Intent justice.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.924
Yeah, well,
you ain't gettin' in.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.263
Maybe check your own house

07:54.391 --> 07:56.383
before you come huffin'
and puffin' at mine.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.305
Turns out
he's one of yours.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.436
It's Vendata.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.970
Councilman 1?

08:01.106 --> 08:03.393
I thought he got killed
in the Sovereign's purge.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.885
Yep, it's him all right.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.059
Hey! Down!

08:06.194 --> 08:07.810
All the more reason
to let us in!

08:07.946 --> 08:09.687
We had an agreement
with you O.S.I.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.234
to collaborate
on this manhunt.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.323
Which you guys crapped all over

08:13.451 --> 08:15.283
when you hit
Dummy Corp tonight.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.869
Or you gonna tell me
that wasn't you?

08:16.997 --> 08:20.411
We did no such thing!
We've been yachting all day.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.410
Then this Morphomobile
came screaming over the bow...

08:23.545 --> 08:24.626
Hey, what's the haps?

08:24.754 --> 08:27.087
Dr. Orpheus held a séance
to unhaunt our house.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.026
And then Pop found Grandpa
in the PROBLEM Light.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.542
Whoa! Was his corpse
all rotten and stuff?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.341
- Or like mummy?
- No, he's still alive.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.384
What? W...
I want to go meet Grandpa.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.133
- It's only his head, though.
- Okay, that gives me pause.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.010
But still...
zombie Grandpa head!

08:41.145 --> 08:42.602
It ain't safe, Hank.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.018
Grandpa's head
thought he was your house,

08:45.150 --> 08:47.608
so he tried to up and run away
with all us inside him.

08:47.736 --> 08:50.444
And then Blue Robot came down
from the sky in his magic car

08:50.572 --> 08:52.734
and made Grandpa stop,
but these guys are

08:52.866 --> 08:54.468
all mad at Blue Robot,
so now Brock is trying...

08:54.492 --> 08:57.235
Okay, okay, stop.
That's kind of a lot.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.861
What on earth
would make Vendata

08:58.997 --> 09:01.080
dress up as the Blue Morpho?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.414
What do you think, Z?

09:02.542 --> 09:03.853
Y-You're the one who built him,
aren't you?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.334
To be completely honest,

09:05.462 --> 09:08.250
much of that summer of '77
is a blur.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.124
This was during
my "lost weekend" phase,

09:11.259 --> 09:12.921
when I teamed up with
Shrill Spector

09:13.053 --> 09:15.670
and Scary Nilsson
on a monthlong bender.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.969
We were sky high on
toot and Brandy Alexanders,

09:19.100 --> 09:20.557
and we were
looking for kicks.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.551
Hey, guys!

09:22.687 --> 09:25.179
Let's go menace
Dr. Venture!

09:25.315 --> 09:27.307
But Jonas was not home.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.560
So we figured we'd just throw
garbage on his lawn

09:30.695 --> 09:32.561
and call it an arch.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.030
And that is
when I found him.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.821
Vendata?
You <i>found</i> Vendata?

09:37.952 --> 09:40.410
No, I found Venturion!

09:40.538 --> 09:42.700
Who the devil
is Venturion?

09:42.832 --> 09:44.448
A super-cool robot!

09:44.584 --> 09:45.995
Or so I thought.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.459
Till I got him back
to my lab

09:47.587 --> 09:49.249
and took a peek
under the hood

09:49.380 --> 09:51.918
and found parts
of a real, live guy in there.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.570
I should have just put
the poor bastard

09:53.676 --> 09:54.676
out of his misery.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.671
But then, I never could resist
an opportunity

09:57.806 --> 10:00.799
to turn one of Dr. Venture's
inventions against him.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.469
So I got to work.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.470
I erased his memory,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.814
reprogrammed him
for calamitous intent.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.979
And one sexy makeover later,

10:11.111 --> 10:14.320
Vendata, as we know him,
was born.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.360
I was ready
to take on Dr. Venture.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.154
But I never got the chance.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.696
Some bungler dropped dime,

10:20.829 --> 10:22.240
and I got pinched
on a narco rap!

10:22.372 --> 10:25.865
By the time I escaped
the Singapore supermax,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.083
Vendata was long gone.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.248
Well, that explains
exactly jack squat

10:30.380 --> 10:33.919
about what he's doing inside
dressed as the Blue Morpho.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.212
Don't you see?
He has come home.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.303
Vendata is not dressed
as the Blue Morpho.

10:39.430 --> 10:43.265
The people parts inside of him
<i>were</i> the Blue Morpho!

10:43.393 --> 10:44.929
Wait, if he used to be
Blue Morpho,

10:45.061 --> 10:46.518
that would make him
my husband's...

10:47.689 --> 10:49.555
All right, you people,
clear this area.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.058
- Come on, disperse.
- You can stand down, Officer.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.105
I got this situation
under control.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.354
- I'm with O.S.I.
- O-S-I don't give a shit.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.175
In eight hours,
this circle's gonna be filled

10:58.199 --> 11:00.156
with people and Underdogs
and Santa and crap.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.285
We got to lock it down.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.237
The Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.079
I forgot all about it!

11:06.207 --> 11:08.824
Your dad put me in charge
of the Ven-Tech float.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.044
Oh, uh, is there
someplace we can go?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.754
I know a diner
around the corner.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.920
Ah, clever girl.
She's luring them away.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.051
Now's our chance.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.714
For what?
To what?

11:19.846 --> 11:22.088
Whoever this Blue Morpho
imposter is,

11:22.223 --> 11:23.634
he's our ticket
out of this mess.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.099
But he had our car.
That means he's seen the cave.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.809
He knows our secret.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.647
That's exactly why
we're gonna kill him.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.975
SGT.
- Nah, nah.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.881
It looks like he's flipping us
the dang bird now.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.318
I need more air
up in those fingers.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.530
Come on, people.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.901
I don't know.
Something just comes over me.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.780
In the moment,
it's like I <i>am</i> Enrico Matassa.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.202
Or... Or the Bat.
Or Russian Guyovitch.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.666
Does that make me crazy?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.000
Am I like the guy
in "Split"?

11:52.128 --> 11:54.586
Yeah, I don't think it's
dissociative identity disorder.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.297
You just have an, um,
an overactive mind.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.836
So, like the guy
in "Split,"

11:58.968 --> 12:01.551
but when he's the guy
in "X-Men."

12:01.679 --> 12:02.990
Hey, is that the museum
where everything

12:03.014 --> 12:04.014
comes to life at night?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.760
Definitely have A.D.D.,
though.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.302
Hey, uh, uh, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

12:09.437 --> 12:11.349
- T-That's my car.
- Sorry, pal.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.762
You're gonna have to pick it up
at the impound. It's at...

12:13.858 --> 12:14.919
Yeah, yeah.
I know where it is.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.230
Can I get something
out of my trunk, please?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.103
Fatty needs his insulin.

12:22.116 --> 12:25.029
<i>Groovy!
Our archenemies are here.</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:26.447
<i>Blue Morpho,</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:30.163
<i>it looks like some evildoers
have entered our lair.</i>

12:30.291 --> 12:31.451
<i>Or we're in for it now,
Jonas.</i>

12:31.542 --> 12:34.034
<i>And they appear to have
a growth ray.</i>

12:34.170 --> 12:35.536
Oh, God.
This is...

12:35.672 --> 12:37.413
Why did I ever let you
talk me into...

12:37.548 --> 12:38.629
What was I thinking?

12:38.758 --> 12:41.125
Jill St. John
and Stella Stevens, man.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.342
What's to think about?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.427
But I... I love my wife.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.263
We're... We're trying to have
a kid, for God's sake, and...

12:47.392 --> 12:48.758
We're not having any luck,

12:48.893 --> 12:50.725
and I
I think it might be my fault.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.938
Don't beat yourself up, B.M.
It's almost never the fella.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.604
But science is doing
wonderful things

12:57.735 --> 12:59.271
with fertility these days.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.270
- Really?
- Oh, sure.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.022
Say, you should have
the little woman

13:03.157 --> 13:06.616
swing by my compound
for a thorough examination.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.531
You...
You think you can help her?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.074
Oh, I know I can.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.324
My science is quite potent.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.950
Bad friend.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.372
I came through, didn't I?

13:16.504 --> 13:18.370
You had a child
within the year.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.817
Sure,
but you took Kano

13:19.841 --> 13:21.753
as payment
for your services.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.671
And you hung that tape
over my head for years

13:23.803 --> 13:25.544
to get me to do
your dirty work!

13:25.680 --> 13:28.844
I need you to make
the Mirror Miser disappear.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.762
I need you to seduce Dr. Z.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.304
I'm fresh out of plutonium.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.225
Well, look who's starting
to sound like his old self.

13:35.356 --> 13:36.472
You remember!

13:36.607 --> 13:39.975
See, old friend?
I'm still helping you.

13:40.111 --> 13:43.070
Hmm, what...
what's good here?

13:43.197 --> 13:45.063
Try the Patti LuPone Melt.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.862
The usual, with the Side by Side
Salad by Sondheim

13:47.994 --> 13:49.235
instead of fries, please.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.488
- Ah, come here often, do you?
- Used to.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.114
Back in the dark ages,

13:54.250 --> 13:56.492
when Sovereign took
the Guild underground.

13:56.627 --> 13:59.210
Bunch of us'd meet up here
every week to talk shop.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.171
There was me, Stab Girl,

14:01.299 --> 14:04.508
Laugh Riot, Mr. Fahrenheit
the Supersonic Man.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.752
Hate-Bit, and Vendata.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.595
We were the new wave
of villains.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.682
Young guns, champing at the bit
to make our own mark.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.517
I don't remember who
first suggested the idea.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.227
Probably started
as a joke.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.349
We should just go up there
and arch the big man himself.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.645
What's stopping us?

14:20.777 --> 14:22.063
Oh, only the Sovereign

14:22.195 --> 14:24.903
and a thousand crew,
and, you know, space.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.774
Now I know
why they call you Laugh Riot.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.026
But Vendata wasn't laughing.

14:31.162 --> 14:34.075
No, he suddenly got this
real serious look on his face.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.869
Did he have any other look?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.038
The man was
a genuine "cy-bore."

14:39.170 --> 14:40.957
He was a tactical genius.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.547
He figured out a way
just six ragtag villains

14:43.674 --> 14:46.291
could hijack
the ninth wonder of the world.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.589
Because he calculated
the precise time

14:48.721 --> 14:53.091
the entire Gargantua crew could
all be found in one place.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.593
Extra! Extra!
It's movie night!

14:55.728 --> 14:58.562
Wait a minute!
I call bullshit.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.306
You're talking about
the Movie Night Massacre,

15:01.442 --> 15:03.149
the night
Jonas Venture died?

15:03.277 --> 15:05.143
That wasn't part
of our plan.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.147
The massacre...
That wasn't us.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.614
Yeah, no kidding.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.324
Because every O.S.I. grunt

15:11.452 --> 15:13.819
knows it was SPHINX
killed Jonas Venture.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.321
Yeah.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.823
You guys'll believe anything.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.370
Sovereign knew that.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.165
So instead of executing us
when he found out

15:22.296 --> 15:25.255
how our unsanctioned raid
went south,

15:25.383 --> 15:27.591
he made lemonade.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.877
That set off
the Pyramid Wars.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.345
I got recruited
to fight in those.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.216
Yes, and you did
one heck of a job.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.684
Wiped our competition
right off the map.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.895
Look at that.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.014
I have never
actually seen a man

15:42.150 --> 15:45.268
realize his whole life
has been a lie.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.770
So if it wasn't you, and it
wasn't SPHINX, who did it?

15:47.905 --> 15:50.864
I have my theories.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.449
Venturion?

15:52.577 --> 15:53.943
Negative. Vendata.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.694
You will comply
with my demands

15:55.830 --> 15:58.994
or will broadcast this,
video documentation,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.367
Jonas Venture,
acts of sexual depravity

16:01.502 --> 16:03.164
in company of one
Blue Morpho.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.629
Fail to see humor.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.999
Oh, you poor deluded half-man.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.593
You <i>are</i> the Blue Morpho.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.008
Negative.
Am Vendata.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.506
You're confused, old chum.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.429
Someone's been monkeying
with your programming.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.768
Let me help you.

16:19.896 --> 16:22.934
Negative! Stay back!
Or will open bay doors.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.022
Entire crew
will be terminated.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.312
No, they won't.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.937
Because my friend would
never do such a thing.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.611
He was a good man, a hero,
and he's still in there.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.985
Now I'm off
to the picture show.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.077
You're welcome to join me,
old friend.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.697
If not, well,

16:39.832 --> 16:42.449
I trust you remember
the way out.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.749
But I was wrong about you,
wasn't I?

16:45.880 --> 16:46.961
You pulled that lever

16:47.089 --> 16:48.796
and killed us all,
didn't you?

16:48.925 --> 16:49.925
Didn't you?!

16:49.967 --> 16:51.458
I... I...

16:51.594 --> 16:54.052
Team Venture
missed the previews.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.263
Hate missing
the beginning of a movie.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.007
What kind of man takes an hour
to pick out an outfit?

16:59.143 --> 17:02.011
You're worse than Jeanie,
Horace!

17:02.146 --> 17:05.184
But we sure as hell caught
the main attraction.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.022
Yeah.
I'm a little confused.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.268
There was nothing in the report
about an explosion.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.692
And yet when you found him,
he was like this?

17:12.823 --> 17:14.108
Just a head?

17:14.242 --> 17:16.700
He's frozen solid!

17:16.827 --> 17:19.615
- We've lost him, Rodney.
- Don't you say that.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.909
We just need to get him
into the PROBLEM.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.897
- Yeah. Found him like that.
- Yeah.

17:27.922 --> 17:29.504
Uh-huh.

17:29.632 --> 17:33.626
H-Hey, those two overheating
there or something?

17:33.761 --> 17:35.878
Something smells...

17:36.013 --> 17:38.050
- Rodney?
- Toast!

17:38.182 --> 17:39.389
Rodney!
What's wrong with you?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.077
Oh, my God, is he having
a heart attack?

17:41.185 --> 17:42.892
- A stroke.
- Oh, my God!

17:43.020 --> 17:44.748
We have to get him
to the hospital right now.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.139
How?
We're stuck in here.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.892
Dad! Hello?!
Snap out of it.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.984
We need you
to open the doors.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.856
It was like this
when he was alive too.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.232
No attention whatsoever.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.647
Dude, will you get
over yourself?

17:57.702 --> 18:00.536
Count Chocula!
Use your voodoo to teleport him!

18:00.663 --> 18:02.325
I am <i>not</i> a...

18:02.456 --> 18:04.698
I-I can't.
I...

18:04.834 --> 18:06.826
I know what to do.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.702
What, run away?
Typical.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.778
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna help.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.588
Hey, looks like
something's wrong

18:15.720 --> 18:16.961
with one of the old dudes.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.176
- What?
- I don't know.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.463
Old people stuff.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.807
- What's fake Blue Morpho doing?
- Nothing.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.893
He's just standing there with
his hand in a refrigerator.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.059
Dude! I... I think
he might be a robot.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.807
Maybe your dad made
life model decoys of himself.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.686
Like Nick Fury in
"Strange Tales" number 135.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.357
Yeah, pretty sure
we would have noticed

18:35.489 --> 18:36.849
one of those lying
around the cave.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.986
Hey.
I think I'm stuck.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.235
So we're all in agreement.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.157
O.S.I. and the Guild

18:43.289 --> 18:45.246
will take joint custody
of Vendata.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.412
He'll be disassembled
for the murder of Jonas Venture

18:48.544 --> 18:50.126
and the crimes of Blue Morpho.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.836
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.125
Check, please.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.374
Watch his head.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.047
Okay, we're clear!

18:58.179 --> 19:01.422
All right.
Hold still.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.552
Maggie's drawers, Whitey!

19:03.684 --> 19:04.684
Sorry!

19:04.685 --> 19:07.348
Sorry! All right, I got this.
Hang on.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.014
Officer! Officer!

19:10.149 --> 19:13.733
This man needs help!
We must get him to hospital!

19:13.861 --> 19:16.399
Aaaaaah!

19:16.530 --> 19:18.522
Holy crap!
Aw, they're gonna get eaten!

19:18.658 --> 19:19.739
You suck, White!

19:19.867 --> 19:22.154
No, no!
I can work with this.

19:22.286 --> 19:26.030
O insect friend,
thou beast who scuttles,

19:26.165 --> 19:29.909
avail us to lend your six legs
as shuttle.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.421
Hyah!

19:35.716 --> 19:37.958
Wow.
They didn't even hesitate.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.585
It's like
they've done that before.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.337
<i>They were one heck of a team.</i>

19:42.473 --> 19:43.473
Dad?

19:43.474 --> 19:44.760
<i>Down here, Rust!</i>

19:44.892 --> 19:46.554
<i>I'm using Venturion's antenna</i>

19:46.686 --> 19:48.348
<i>to speak to your watch

19:48.479 --> 19:50.266
<i>via the 2.4 gigahertz
frequency.</i>

19:50.398 --> 19:52.856
Yeah, Wi-Fi, Dad.
We call that the Wi-Fi.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.020
<i>Fun! Now listen
very carefully, son.</i>

19:55.152 --> 19:57.360
<i>I need you to do something
for me while he's distracted.</i>

19:57.488 --> 19:58.695
<i>You, little boy...</i>

19:58.823 --> 20:00.940
<i>I overhead you say you were
a neurogeneticist?</i>

20:01.075 --> 20:02.862
It's Billy.
And I'm not a little boy.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.780
<i>Super!
Billy, I'm going to need you</i>

20:04.912 --> 20:07.370
<i>to transplant my brain
into Venturion...</i>

20:07.498 --> 20:09.581
<i>temporarily, of course,
until Rusty and I can</i>

20:09.709 --> 20:11.541
<i>get the ol' clone program
up and running.</i>

20:11.669 --> 20:13.251
Wait, no.
That'll kill him.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.711
I took a Hippocratic oath.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.832
<i>I</i> didn't!

20:17.967 --> 20:18.967
Ah, geez.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.215
Step away from the...
What did you call it?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.258
- Life model decoy!
- Right!

20:24.390 --> 20:27.428
Step away from the...
Whoa. Is that your dad?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.348
I'm telling you,
it couldn't have been me.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.095
I'd remember that.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.348
Wait.
What are you looking at?

20:34.483 --> 20:35.483
N-Nothing.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.609
Finish your thought.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.444
What are you up to
out there?

20:45.286 --> 20:46.948
M-Malcom?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.366
- Uh, w-what?
- Malcom?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.786
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

20:55.921 --> 20:57.207
What the fuck
did you call me?

20:57.339 --> 20:59.797
Who the hell are you?

20:59.925 --> 21:03.339
Blue bastard!
Don't ruin this for me!

21:03.471 --> 21:05.178
Son of a...

21:23.324 --> 21:25.065
Awesome!

21:25.201 --> 21:27.989
Are you guys gonna do that
in the parade?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.201
Get out of the way!

21:34.293 --> 21:36.660
Daddy? D-Daddy?

21:41.008 --> 21:42.874
You!

21:43.010 --> 21:44.171
You got him!

21:44.303 --> 21:47.762
I... Yeah, I, uh, got him.

21:47.890 --> 21:51.179
Heh.
I killed the Blue Morpho. Heh.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.179
Oh, and I kicked
Jonas Venture's ass too.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.386
Huh.
Is it safe to be up here?

22:28.514 --> 22:31.848
Not according to
that know-it-all fire marshal.

22:31.976 --> 22:35.060
But there was no way in hell
I was giving up <i>this</i> view.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.305
Dad, I wish you could see this,
but you're dead. Again.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.601
Oh, hey, speaking of.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.191
O.S.I. wants the head
for research and crap.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.319
You cool with that?

22:43.404 --> 22:46.397
Don't you fret now, Rose.
Old Rodney will pull through.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.866
This ain't his first rodeo.
Or his first coma.

22:49.994 --> 22:53.078
Come on, think about it, O.
It's perfect for us.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.913
Three floors,
a garage for the Triadmobile.

22:56.041 --> 22:56.958
Blood Vessel.

22:56.959 --> 22:59.667
Plus, it's got
a Dr. Strange window.

22:59.795 --> 23:00.795
Oh.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.662
Here he comes!

23:02.798 --> 23:04.460
And don't look now.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.549
Here comes Rusty Venture,

23:06.677 --> 23:08.794
star of
"The Rusty Venture Show."

23:08.929 --> 23:10.740
The newest
addition to the parade,

23:10.764 --> 23:12.801
Rusty is proudly
sponsored by...

23:12.933 --> 23:15.220
Whoa!
Oh, my God! Look out!

23:15.352 --> 23:17.719
Ladies and
gentlemen, they've lost control.

23:17.855 --> 23:19.471
Oh, this is...
This is terrible, folks.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.501
<i>This is not what
the Pilgrims had in mind!</i>

23:21.525 --> 23:23.295
<i>If you have
young children in the room,</i>

23:23.319 --> 23:24.685
<i>please turn the channel.</i>

23:28.115 --> 23:29.115
Toast!
