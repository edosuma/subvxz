WEBVTT

00:05.353 --> 00:07.050
Damn.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.443
I can't buy one today, Laz.

00:08.486 --> 00:09.792
- Kev, you ain't been able to
buy one

00:09.835 --> 00:11.489
for the past three weeks.

00:16.277 --> 00:17.321
- I see.
- I'll take this home.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.757
Watch me take this home.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.542
- Take your time, Laz.
It's the game ball.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.588
- Pay up, trick.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.068
- That's how you feel?
- Hey, yo, Daryl.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.461
- Yeah?
- Can you hear that?

00:26.504 --> 00:28.202
- What's that?
- Can you hear that?

00:28.245 --> 00:29.551
- What am I supposed to hear?
- That sound like money.

00:29.594 --> 00:30.856
- Ching-ching.
- Yeah, that's money.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.206
- Oh, that's what it is.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.685
- Stacks on stacks on stacks
on stacks...

00:33.729 --> 00:36.297
- Laz loves to talk.
- Yeah, I wish Daryl did.

00:36.340 --> 00:37.863
- Man doesn't say much
'cause he's smart.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.735
- Let's double up on the next
one, Kev.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.606
Only right I give you
the chance to get some back.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.565
- That's real money
right there, we talking 500.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.175
- Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
I ain't scared of y'all.

00:45.219 --> 00:47.308
If we gonna ball, we might
as well ball for real.

00:47.351 --> 00:48.700
- Then let's make it 1,000.

00:48.744 --> 00:50.659
- Aw, man, scared money don't
make no money.

00:50.702 --> 00:51.747
Let's make it two.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.357
It's just money, bro.
- All right.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.664
- Two grand?
Is Kev nuts?

00:55.707 --> 00:58.319
CPD will reimburse him
a few hundred if he's lucky.

00:58.362 --> 00:59.929
- He'll be all right.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.322
- More money in the bank.

01:02.671 --> 01:07.589
- ♪ Hey, hey,
hey, hey ♪

01:08.677 --> 01:10.113
♪ Hey

01:10.157 --> 01:12.594
- That's all she wrote, lads.
Yo, D, you hear that?

01:12.637 --> 01:15.031
- What's that, man?
- That's Laz losing money, man.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.861
Hey, yo, Laz,
you got hustled, man.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.341
Kev played you like a chump.

01:20.384 --> 01:22.038
Hey, man, your girl probably
chilling at your crib

01:22.082 --> 01:25.128
with a t-shirt that say
"Go Kevin," with no drawers on.

01:26.608 --> 01:27.739
- Man, at least I don't
go around

01:27.783 --> 01:29.045
kissing old man ass all day.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.656
- Yo, what'd you just say?

01:31.700 --> 01:33.963
- Man, I was just playing.

01:34.006 --> 01:35.791
- Say it again...

01:38.010 --> 01:39.055
What you just said.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.144
- Come on, man.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.537
- Yo--
- Yo, yo--

01:42.580 --> 01:43.712
- I said say it.

01:43.755 --> 01:44.930
- What'd you pull the guns out
for, man?

01:44.974 --> 01:46.018
- Shut up, Kevin.

01:46.062 --> 01:48.804
I'ma ask you one more time,

01:48.847 --> 01:52.112
say what you just said
about me kissing ass.

01:52.155 --> 01:55.158
- I didn't mean anything by it.
I was just trying to be funny.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.334
- Oh, so you funny now?

01:57.378 --> 01:58.988
- Okay, will you stop all
the cowboy stuff,

01:59.031 --> 02:00.120
and let me get my money?

02:00.163 --> 02:01.860
- Shut your damn mouth, Kev.

02:01.904 --> 02:03.253
Answer me.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.037
- He still hasn't used
the distress word.

02:05.081 --> 02:08.128
- Funny now?

02:08.171 --> 02:11.827
- No.
Not funny.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.090
Not funny at all.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.839
Hey, yo, Mitch, man,
look at his face.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.102
He's shook.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.408
Hey, we all good, homie.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.584
Collect your dough, Kev.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.976
- Cool.

02:36.417 --> 02:39.376
- I don't mind boys being boys,

02:39.420 --> 02:42.858
unless they pretending
to be men.

02:42.901 --> 02:45.600
You understand me, son?

02:45.643 --> 02:46.992
- Yes, sir.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.649
- Phil Gamble in the flesh.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.218
- This Gamble guy,
he's real careful.

02:55.262 --> 02:58.003
And his right-hand man, Daryl,

02:58.047 --> 03:00.267
not easy to get in with.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.748
So, I gotta ask you, Ray,

03:03.792 --> 03:06.490
why are you dropping the dime
on these two?

03:07.448 --> 03:10.190
- Because they're bad
for Chicago.

03:10.233 --> 03:11.800
- So is deep-dish pizza.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.500
Well, deep dish
may be fattening,

03:16.544 --> 03:19.590
but they don't destroy
young black lives.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.679
- Got nothing to do with money?

03:21.723 --> 03:22.680
- Excuse me?

03:22.724 --> 03:24.465
- These two been
contributing to

03:24.508 --> 03:26.380
the Ray Price
Philanthropy Fund?

03:26.423 --> 03:29.861
- Let's just say that
their philanthropic generosity

03:29.905 --> 03:31.298
has waned in recent months.

03:31.341 --> 03:32.429
- So it is about money?

03:32.473 --> 03:33.735
- It's always about money,
Hank.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.345
- Especially when
people say it isn't.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.832
All right, look...

03:43.875 --> 03:47.836
truth is, these two
don't belong on the street,

03:47.879 --> 03:50.447
and they sure as hell
don't belong in my ward.

03:52.362 --> 03:55.713
So, I had some people dig
deeper into Daryl

03:55.757 --> 03:57.976
and found some particulars.

03:59.543 --> 04:01.197
Maybe there's something in
there that might help

04:01.241 --> 04:03.243
your man Atwater
get in tighter.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.421
- Appreciate that, man.

04:09.423 --> 04:12.991
- You and me, Hank...

04:13.035 --> 04:15.559
we love this city.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.126
We dedicated our lives
to this city.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.345
So, when people don't treat
her right,

04:18.388 --> 04:19.911
when they disrespect
the very institute

04:19.955 --> 04:22.958
that we love so dearly...

04:25.003 --> 04:29.138
We have no choice but to take
matters into our own hands.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.361
- It's good to see you again,
Ray.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.070
- Our shot caller is
Phil Gamble,

04:48.113 --> 04:49.463
been in the gang for 20 years,

04:49.506 --> 04:51.203
has a very diversified
portfolio of

04:51.247 --> 04:53.380
criminal enterprises,
but he makes most of his money

04:53.423 --> 04:55.599
the old fashioned way...
mostly drugs.

04:55.643 --> 04:56.905
Heroin, to be exact.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.950
- Yeah, we ran into Gamble
a while back.

04:58.994 --> 05:01.475
Rival dealer was putting out
lethal product

05:01.518 --> 05:02.911
under Gamble's logo.

05:02.954 --> 05:06.175
So, he shot said rival
in the face three times,

05:06.218 --> 05:08.438
practically told me as much.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.614
- Gamble's number two is
Daryl Ingram.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.181
And this guy, Laz, he works
underneath him.

05:12.224 --> 05:14.749
- Yeah, Laz, unlike Daryl,
is extremely gullible.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.098
I've been working him as
an unwitting

05:16.141 --> 05:17.491
for the past three weeks.

05:17.534 --> 05:18.622
Thinks we're buddies
and we're gonna start

05:18.666 --> 05:20.145
a nightclub together soon.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.799
But Daryl, on the other hand,
tight as hell,

05:21.843 --> 05:23.453
doesn't get involved with
outsiders at all.

05:23.497 --> 05:25.803
- All right, so, we gotta find
a way to gain his trust.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.457
- I'm doing my best, Sarge,

05:27.501 --> 05:29.241
dusted off my ol' pool game
and everything.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.547
But I'm gonna need a new angle,

05:30.591 --> 05:31.722
'cause I'm nowhere near
the pocket.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.985
- I think I found your angle.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.336
In Price's file,
he jotted down a few notes

05:36.379 --> 05:37.685
on Daryl's weak spot.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.426
- Okay, weak spots are good.
What is it?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.428
- More like 'who.'

05:41.471 --> 05:42.951
- Look alive, Vance.
- Red, lock him, man.

05:42.994 --> 05:44.431
- Aw, he really can't guard
you there, though.

05:44.474 --> 05:45.867
There it is right there.
There you go.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.347
- Hey, help out, help out.
- Yes, thank you.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.783
Thank you.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.002
That's your man right there
not locking up?

05:51.046 --> 05:52.264
He don't lock up good.

05:52.308 --> 05:53.353
Feed him again.
Feed him again.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.442
There you go.
Uh-huh.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.487
Got him off his feet...

05:57.531 --> 05:59.359
Swisher Sweet.

05:59.402 --> 06:02.144
You see that?
I like that, Vance.

06:02.187 --> 06:05.147
Talk to me after the game,
I got something for you.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.975
Huh--yeah.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.456
- All right, see ya.
- All right.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.458
- Yo, Vance, what up?
Kev.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.503
- What's up?
Uh, who you with?

06:13.547 --> 06:15.200
- Chi-Town Burners.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.680
From us to you, boy.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.247
You know, the streets been
talking about

06:18.290 --> 06:19.770
a 15-year old PG
that's making noise.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.381
I had to check you out
for myself.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.165
You nice, bro.
- Thank you.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.601
Burner's a good team.

06:24.645 --> 06:25.994
- Oh, we ain't bad,
but we could be better.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.691
Looking to bring in
20 new players.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.867
Tryouts are next month,
and it's invite only.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.696
I'm looking at you, bro.
You could play up a age group.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.785
So how 'bout you lock
your number in my phone?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.134
- All right.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.440
- I'll shoot you a official
invite real soon.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.529
You got a ride?

06:39.573 --> 06:41.575
Cold as hell, boy,
the hawk is kicking.

06:41.618 --> 06:42.750
I gotchu.
- All right, man.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.142
Appreciate you.
- Yeah.

06:49.974 --> 06:53.064
- Yo, man, like I always tell
my little brother,

06:53.108 --> 06:55.284
play hard, work harder.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.460
- Hmm.
- You feel?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.375
You gonna be all good.
- Thank you, sir.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.899
- Call me Kev, bro.

07:03.379 --> 07:05.207
Take it easy, bro.
- You too.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.086
- Hey!

07:15.130 --> 07:16.436
- What are you doing with
my brother?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.002
- Your brother?

07:18.046 --> 07:19.439
Man, what the hell are you even
talking about, man?

07:19.482 --> 07:20.918
- I asked you a question.

07:22.572 --> 07:25.488
- I scout for the AAU program,
and I was watching Vance hoop.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.098
All right?
That boy got skills.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.274
I was chopping it up with him.
I gave him a ride home.

07:29.318 --> 07:30.711
All right?

07:30.754 --> 07:31.973
How was I 'posed to know
he was related to you?

07:32.016 --> 07:33.496
- So, you a coach now,
Mr. Pool Hustler?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.150
- Dude, I'm a scout,
and I got a coach.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.195
I got college connections,
and I can introduce you to 'em

07:37.239 --> 07:40.024
if you get this damn gun
off of my neck.

07:42.549 --> 07:46.553
I wanna meet him, this coach...

07:46.596 --> 07:48.511
me and my brother.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.687
Set it up in one hour.

07:50.731 --> 07:54.996
If he ain't legit
or you playing with me...

07:55.953 --> 07:58.129
I'll kill you.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.485
I'll see you in an hour.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.147
Coach Rollins old school, man.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.540
- That's right, Vance.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.803
I demand commitment,
excellence, and respect.

08:19.847 --> 08:22.850
But you do what I ask,
you'll reap the benefits.

08:22.893 --> 08:24.895
- Yeah, Coach gets kids into
college for a fact.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.289
- And if you're good enough,
The League.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.683
Yeah, I got four young brothers
playing for the NBA right now,

08:29.726 --> 08:32.033
making a total of
$37 million a year.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.601
You think you can help
my brother get

08:34.644 --> 08:35.732
into the next level?

08:35.776 --> 08:37.081
- I will try my hardest.
- Crazy.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.866
- And that's all that
I'll promise.

08:38.909 --> 08:41.738
'Cause at the end of the day,
it's all up to Vance.

08:44.349 --> 08:45.786
- All right then.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.396
- Daryl, pleasure to meet you.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.832
- Thanks for your time.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.660
- Vance, I look forward to
working with you.

08:50.704 --> 08:52.053
- Thank you.
See you, Coach.

08:52.096 --> 08:54.055
- Take it easy, dawg.
- All right.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.754
- Coach, appreciate you,
'cause I know this

08:57.798 --> 08:59.016
ain't really your speed.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.670
- Look, you took care of
my nephew,

09:00.714 --> 09:02.367
and I'm more than happy to
return the favor,

09:02.411 --> 09:04.326
but, uh, we're all good now?

09:04.369 --> 09:06.328
- All good.
- All right.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.677
- Yo, yo.

09:07.721 --> 09:08.678
I got good news.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.071
Me and Daryl are solid.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.768
We're doing dinner tonight
at his bar.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.770
- All right, so, let's figure
out a way to exploit

09:13.814 --> 09:15.206
this newfound trust.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.860
- Kev, why don't you intro me
as a buyer?

09:16.904 --> 09:18.819
- No, he doesn't sell to
outside dealers at all.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.864
He's got a tight network,
not looking to expand.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.953
- Or we could come at it
from the other end.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.825
We could sell to him
rather than buy from him.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.174
- I like the way you think,

09:26.217 --> 09:27.697
but that's not gonna work
either.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.046
He's got a supplier that
he likes a lot.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.918
- Man, solution without
a problem.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.529
- All right, so we create
the problem.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.705
I'll make a call.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.968
- I will take it off
your plate so completely

09:38.012 --> 09:40.884
and put it on mine,
it'll make your head spin.

09:40.928 --> 09:43.060
Hey, Hank.
Hey, come here, will you?

09:43.104 --> 09:44.584
Maybe you can help me
with this.

09:44.627 --> 09:45.715
Having a heck of a time.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.761
- What--help with what?

09:47.804 --> 09:52.766
- Convincing Ray here to
publicly endorse me for Mayor.

09:54.550 --> 09:57.074
- Ray's his own man.
Doesn't need any input from me.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.250
- I keep telling you, man,
you're bad for my brand.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.775
Even though I like you,
more or less,

10:01.818 --> 10:03.951
there ain't no way in hell
I can tell anyone,

10:03.994 --> 10:05.866
let alone endorse
your white ass.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.302
So, please, stop asking.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.434
Oh, Ray.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.741
I can't stop asking you, baby.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.874
Cut from the same cloth, huh?

10:13.917 --> 10:15.266
- Yes.
- Oh, look at that.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.833
Time for me to go.
I got three more aldermen

10:16.877 --> 10:18.313
to hit before dinner.

10:18.356 --> 10:19.749
Hopefully they're not as racist
as your ass.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.621
All the best.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.318
Hank.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.669
- I take it you and Kelton
aren't too close.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.845
- Nah.

10:28.889 --> 10:31.239
I just don't like politicians.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.849
- Yeah.

10:34.155 --> 10:38.899
Their supplier, his name is
Franco Vertiz, lives in Pilsen.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.162
He's been in Mexico
the past week.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.293
- Huh.

10:42.337 --> 10:44.121
- But I never give up, Hank.

10:44.165 --> 10:47.037
I just keep digging and digging
until I find gold

10:47.081 --> 10:51.694
and this, my friend,
is pure gold.

10:54.262 --> 10:56.307
The address to Franco's
stash house.

11:03.837 --> 11:06.143
- Ready?
- Yeah.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.449
Chicago PD.

11:07.492 --> 11:08.972
Hey, put the hammer down.
Put the hammer down.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.887
Manos, manos.
Come towards me.

11:10.931 --> 11:12.149
- Español, por favor.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.542
- Put your hands on
the counter.

11:13.585 --> 11:14.891
Turn around.
- Hey, come here.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.893
Come here.
- What are doing to mi mama?

11:16.937 --> 11:18.982
- Stairs.
- Hailey.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.681
- I'm going up the stairs.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.509
Hey!
Got one upstairs.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.120
- Right behind you.

11:29.123 --> 11:31.560
- Gun!
- Shoot at them.

11:31.603 --> 11:32.822
- What do you see?
What do you see?

11:32.866 --> 11:34.650
- Two teenage girls.
One's got a gun.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.696
We're the police--policía.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.827
You gotta put the gun down.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.830
- One...
- Hailey, wait.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.179
- Two...
- Wait.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.572
- Three...
- Hey, don't shoot!

11:43.615 --> 11:45.313
- Kim!
- Hey.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.316
- What the hell was that?

11:48.359 --> 11:49.534
- Gun was unloaded.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.145
They kept saying,
"No bullets, no bullets."

11:51.188 --> 11:52.755
- I didn't know
you spoke Spanish.

12:06.464 --> 12:10.207
- Fifty kilos.
Cinco-cero.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.383
That's a lot of heroin.

12:16.648 --> 12:17.954
- She says that she doesn't
know his name,

12:17.998 --> 12:20.000
but he said if the drugs
ever disappeared,

12:20.043 --> 12:22.176
he'd kill her whole family.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.525
- That's why
she pulled the gun,

12:23.568 --> 12:24.787
with or without bullets.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.397
- Yeah.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.356
What now, book her?

12:29.574 --> 12:32.752
- No.
Talk to Trudy.

12:32.795 --> 12:36.190
Let's get her
and her family out of town.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.887
- Anything?
- No.

12:37.931 --> 12:41.021
Get word to Atwater we
disrupted Daryl's supply chain.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.631
We got maybe
a two, three-day window.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.285
We gotta move.
- Copy.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.026
- It cost me $50,000
a week.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.550
It told you, you have to have
a backup plan.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.030
You can't go half ass.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.249
You gotta get it together,
don't you understand?

12:52.293 --> 12:54.208
Come on, man.

12:54.251 --> 12:57.602
- Who go next?
Nobody?

12:57.646 --> 13:00.388
Cool, well, I'm gonna get
a drink, man.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.869
Whoever's ready,
you just rack 'em up,

13:02.912 --> 13:04.740
'cause I'm here all night.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.220
- What are you having?
- Can I get a beer, bro?

13:06.263 --> 13:07.656
- Sure thing.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.049
What's wrong with you, man?

13:09.092 --> 13:10.746
You look like
you write songs for Drake.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.792
All up in yo' feelings,
ain't you?

13:15.185 --> 13:19.320
- The blue goons choked up
my connect, so we offline.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.888
50K a week, man.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.238
- Damn.
- Yeah.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.718
- Well, if you don't mind me
asking,

13:26.762 --> 13:28.677
what kind of product got took?

13:32.899 --> 13:35.031
- Heroin.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.641
- Huh.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.385
- What?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.345
Spit it out, man.

13:44.388 --> 13:45.955
- Okay, you may not be
interested,

13:45.999 --> 13:49.741
but I got a boy who lives in
Northwest area, Irving Park...

13:49.785 --> 13:53.223
I know he in that game,
serves heavy weight.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.225
That's all I know.

13:55.269 --> 13:57.967
- You say you got a boy?

13:58.011 --> 13:59.664
- I got a boy.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.058
Like, I've known him for, like,
ten years, he's my boy.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.886
You know, I don't get
too involved in his business,

14:03.930 --> 14:06.454
but I know it involves
Mexican tan.

14:07.324 --> 14:08.935
That ain't my lane, though.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.637
- You can set up a meeting?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.989
Yeah.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.818
- What's your cut?

14:22.862 --> 14:26.082
- I don't want nothing.
Just know I did you a solid.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.477
That's it, that's all.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.001
- Cheers.

14:35.178 --> 14:38.138
- Okay.
Let's start slow.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.704
One kilo.

14:40.836 --> 14:43.578
You re-up fast
and we can add more weight.

14:43.621 --> 14:46.059
- One kilo ain't gonna do it,
bro.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.191
I got a hungry clientele.

14:48.235 --> 14:51.194
I need five, minimum.

14:51.238 --> 14:53.675
- I don't...
- Trust me, bro.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.025
Daryl's legit, good money.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.514
Okay, but I'm gonna need
10% up front.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.088
How's 20 sound?

15:15.131 --> 15:16.785
- Ooh-wee.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.183
- It's twice as good as ten.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.011
Okay.

15:25.054 --> 15:26.969
Come back in three hours
when we're closed.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.449
No guns.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.975
I respect the fact
you trust me.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.109
- I respect the fact you know
not to skate with my money.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.198
- Yeah.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.461
Hey, you bring Kevin with you,
too, all right?

15:40.504 --> 15:41.984
Makes me feel good
when he's around.

15:42.028 --> 15:45.118
- Aw, man, I just like being
around all this money.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.946
- Ha.

15:49.339 --> 15:51.951
- All right, Atwater's gonna be
with Daryl at the meet.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.475
We set a perimeter around
the auto detail shop.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.564
Adam, I want you outside
on foot.

15:56.607 --> 15:59.306
Goal is, we snatch up Daryl
fast and quiet,

15:59.349 --> 16:00.611
get him right back out on
the street

16:00.655 --> 16:02.091
as a cooperating witness.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.440
- So, how are we protecting
ourselves against

16:03.484 --> 16:05.007
a potential entrapment defense?

16:05.051 --> 16:07.314
- I told Kev make it clear
Daryl wants the dope.

16:07.357 --> 16:08.750
We're sellers, not buyers.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.186
- Think we're ready, boss,
let's go.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.840
- All right, let's do it.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.977
- How are you so calm, dawg?

16:20.588 --> 16:22.894
- I just am.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.548
People only really get scared

16:24.592 --> 16:25.941
when they trying to be
something they ain't.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.073
- Hmm, right.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.596
I used to tell
my little brother that

16:28.639 --> 16:30.250
right before basketball games.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.947
I'd say, "Know your role.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.470
Don't be scared
of who you are."

16:33.514 --> 16:35.864
- I like that.
- Yeah.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.432
- I might just drop that
on Vance before his next game.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.260
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.739
- Yeah, he a good kid, bro.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.959
- Yeah, man, that's my heart,
right there.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.830
- I already know.

16:45.874 --> 16:50.531
- You know, he's what
I'd be--try to be...

16:51.314 --> 16:52.968
You know?
- Right.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.666
If things were different.
I feel you.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.191
- Yeah.

16:59.409 --> 17:03.065
See, my pops got locked up
early, so I had no choice.

17:03.109 --> 17:06.764
I had to step up,
take care of things.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.289
- I been there, bro.

17:09.332 --> 17:10.986
For real.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.904
Hey, but you had
a Gamble in your life.

17:15.947 --> 17:18.559
You got lucky.
He got you right, man.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.561
- Hey, man, way I see it,
Gamble got lucky

17:20.604 --> 17:22.606
taking me in, bro.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.608
- I see you don't go no problem
with confidence.

17:26.697 --> 17:27.742
- Yeah, man.

17:30.658 --> 17:34.314
- Atwater and Daryl just
passed us, maroon SUV.

17:34.357 --> 17:35.706
- Copy that.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.012
We're in position on
the northeast corner,

17:37.056 --> 17:38.492
got eyes on
the auto detail shop.

17:38.535 --> 17:39.493
Adam, you good?

17:39.536 --> 17:40.711
- Yeah, roger that.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.017
I'm at the southwest corner

17:42.061 --> 17:43.671
outside the meeting spot,
out back.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.413
- Yo, you ain't packing, right?

17:46.456 --> 17:48.328
- Nah, man.

17:48.371 --> 17:49.720
Your boy said no guns.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.070
- All right.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.594
- Gotta respect
the seller's demand.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.684
That's part of being
a good businessman.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.555
Learned that from Gamble.
- Yeah, I like that.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.340
- Yeah.

18:01.645 --> 18:02.951
- What the hell?

18:02.994 --> 18:04.518
- Pull the vehicle to
the curb.

18:04.561 --> 18:05.519
Now.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.868
- You can't be serious.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.783
We're barely going
20 miles an hour.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.613
- What the hell is going on?

18:12.656 --> 18:14.441
They're 20 yards from
the meeting spot.

18:21.361 --> 18:22.623
- We got Illinois tags.

18:22.666 --> 18:26.757
It's George-Paul-9-2-1-John-1.

18:26.801 --> 18:29.108
- Copy 2913, we're running it.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.806
Got you held down
at that stop.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.332
- Turn your car off, sir.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.599
What's up, guys?
Where you headed?

18:42.643 --> 18:43.948
- Visiting a friend.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.254
- This friend got a name?

18:45.298 --> 18:46.603
- May I ask what this is
about, Officer?

18:46.647 --> 18:47.691
- No, you may not.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.040
You just answer the question

18:49.084 --> 18:50.868
and keep your hands where
I can see 'em.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.045
- Name is Tony.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.439
- Right, two brothers
visiting a dago?

18:56.483 --> 18:58.572
It doesn't ring true, homie.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.139
- Come on, Doyle.
Hey, guys...

19:00.182 --> 19:01.749
- What the hell?
- Just doing our job.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.185
- Hey, Sarge,
are you hearing this?

19:03.229 --> 19:06.275
- Everybody stand down,
just let it play out.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.321
Hopefully, these guys don't
burn Atwater,

19:08.364 --> 19:09.626
blow this whole thing up.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.759
- Any guns, knives, drugs?

19:11.802 --> 19:14.544
- We do not, like he said,
we're just visiting a friend.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.198
- Yeah, right.
Tony, right?

19:16.242 --> 19:17.765
So, what are you gonna do
when you get there?

19:17.808 --> 19:19.636
Make some linguini?
Huh?

19:19.680 --> 19:21.508
Hey, when I ask you a question,

19:21.551 --> 19:23.162
I want an answer
and eye contact.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.599
- Units in the 29
and units on the citywide,

19:25.642 --> 19:29.298
an armed robbery just occurred
at 1344 Luther Drive.

19:29.342 --> 19:33.041
Offenders are described as
male, black, late 20s,

19:33.084 --> 19:35.739
approximately six-foot tall.

19:35.783 --> 19:38.351
- Out of the car,
nice and slow.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.656
Hands where I can see 'em.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.484
- Let's go guys,
out of the car now.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.138
We're gonna need
to search you.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.448
- You boys do that robbery
over on Luther Drive?

19:48.491 --> 19:49.797
- We certainly did not,

19:49.840 --> 19:51.190
and we're not boys, Officer,
we're men.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.408
- What did you just say
to me?

19:52.452 --> 19:54.062
- I said we're men.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.282
- Yo--
- Yo, hey, man.

19:56.325 --> 20:00.199
- You feel like a man now, huh?
Don't get cute with me.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.984
Let's go, back at the car,
let's go.

20:03.027 --> 20:04.594
- We didn't even do nothing.
- Hands.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.248
- Listen, Officer, I don't
have a problem letting you--

20:06.292 --> 20:07.641
- Shut your mouth and keep
your hands on--

20:07.684 --> 20:08.946
- What's your problem, man?

20:08.990 --> 20:10.426
- Face forward,
do not look at me.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.993
- This is going sideways.
What are we doing here?

20:12.036 --> 20:13.603
- Stand down.
Let Atwater handle it.

20:13.647 --> 20:14.996
- Hands, let's go.
Let's go.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.606
Hands.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.739
- Hey, you shut 'em up.
Put in the back of the car.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.610
- Hey, man, what the--what's
your problem, man?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.221
You've been buggin'
this whole time.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.439
- Hey!
Hey!

20:23.483 --> 20:24.875
Let me see your hands!

20:24.919 --> 20:26.225
- We were just driving on
the goddamn street.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.748
We were just driving on
the damn street.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.228
- Daryl, just do what he says,
okay?

20:29.271 --> 20:31.142
- Now, get on the ground.
Get on your knees now.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.709
- I ain't getting on my knees.
- I will not ask you again.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.276
Final warning.
- Let me go in.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.409
- Talk to your partner, man.
Try and control him.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.324
- Get your black ass
on your knees right now.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.015
- Not a word about Atwater.
I wanna keep his cover intact.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.148
- Sergeant--
- Yeah.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.628
Even though Daryl
just got shot.

21:21.671 --> 21:24.892
Now just hang back.
Let me handle this.

21:28.330 --> 21:31.333
Sergeant Hank Voight,
Intelligence.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.422
We're in the neighborhood
working a case.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.119
- The offender reached for
my weapon.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.207
I was in fear for my life.

21:36.251 --> 21:37.600
- Don't talk to me.

21:37.644 --> 21:40.342
Save your story for COPA
and IRT, you understand?

21:40.386 --> 21:42.779
- Yeah.
Yeah, right, thanks.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.391
- So, what about the other
guy in the car?

21:45.434 --> 21:46.870
You charging him?

21:46.914 --> 21:48.350
- Yeah, we'll process him
after we handle all this.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.352
- Huh.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.616
I'll tell you what,
why don't I transport him

21:53.660 --> 21:56.402
back to your district,
get him off the scene?

21:56.445 --> 21:59.274
I think you two got enough
to focus on, huh?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.189
- Yeah, that'd be great.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.799
- No problem.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.497
- Make sure
you write him up good.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.976
He was belligerent
and disorderly.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.544
- Don't worry,
I'll take care of this prick.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.504
Might even hit him with
assault and battery, too.

22:15.246 --> 22:18.337
Let's go.
Come on, get out.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.816
Let's go.

22:21.296 --> 22:22.558
All right, you're still under.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.908
Keep your mouth shut
until we're alone.

22:24.952 --> 22:27.302
Come on, let's go.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.564
- Ain't nobody
gonna cover him up?

22:28.608 --> 22:30.784
- Shut up.
Come on.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.397
Come on.

22:43.013 --> 22:45.886
- Kev, you okay?

22:45.929 --> 22:48.105
Kev, what the hell happened?
- I don't know.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.803
- What--
- I don't know.

22:49.846 --> 22:52.327
All I know is that
those punks murdered Daryl.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.418
Damn near shot me, too...

22:56.462 --> 22:59.290
over nothing--over driving
while being black.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.878
- Kevin Anderson,
you made bail.

23:21.922 --> 23:23.837
Come on, man,
I ain't got all day.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.627
- Moved as fast as I could.

23:31.671 --> 23:34.325
- Appreciate that.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.805
- Just get your head straight.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.547
You have to talk to
COPA and IRT soon.

23:38.591 --> 23:39.896
- I'm ready when they are.

23:39.940 --> 23:44.814
- Kevin...I know you're hot.
I get it.

23:45.728 --> 23:48.688
You gotta take some time.
Calm down.

23:48.731 --> 23:51.734
Let's make sense of all this.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.650
- No, thanks, Sarge.
I don't wanna calm down.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.043
I don't wanna
make sense of this,

23:56.086 --> 23:58.480
'cause what just happened
can't keep happening.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.830
No, this gotta stop.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.011
- Superintendent.

24:08.055 --> 24:09.360
- I just spoke to IRT.

24:09.404 --> 24:10.797
I wanted to make sure that

24:10.840 --> 24:12.494
everything I was hearing was,
in fact, true

24:12.538 --> 24:14.844
and that nothing was getting
lost in translation.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.498
But I'll be honest with you,
Hank,

24:16.542 --> 24:18.674
I am having a very hard time
understanding

24:18.718 --> 24:20.850
what just happened.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.504
- How can I help?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.724
- You could tell me that
your man Atwater

24:24.767 --> 24:26.726
wasn't really working
undercover when

24:26.769 --> 24:29.511
that tragic officer-involved
shooting occurred.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.513
- Atwater was there.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.949
He was on the scene,

24:32.993 --> 24:34.951
and he maintained
his cover identity

24:34.995 --> 24:36.692
like a smart cop is
supposed to.

24:36.736 --> 24:39.129
- A smart cop is supposed to
make sure that

24:39.173 --> 24:40.522
a guy doesn't get shot.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.611
That's what a smart cop is
supposed to do.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.047
- Atwater played it right.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.397
He tried to deescalate
the situation,

24:46.441 --> 24:47.703
while maintaining his--

24:47.747 --> 24:49.705
- Oh, come on, Hank!
Give me a break.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.185
How could
he have played it right

24:51.228 --> 24:53.274
when we got ourselves
one dead black kid?

24:53.317 --> 24:54.536
Huh?

24:54.580 --> 24:57.452
In what universe is that
playing it right?

24:59.367 --> 25:02.501
When these facts come out,
if they break the wrong way,

25:02.544 --> 25:03.980
Atwater goes down.

25:04.024 --> 25:06.287
It's the cost of
doing business.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.332
You're dismissed.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.947
Did I stutter?

25:15.557 --> 25:17.037
all:
Black lives matter.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.431
Black lives matter.
Black lives matter.

25:20.475 --> 25:22.085
Black lives matter.

25:22.129 --> 25:25.741
Black lives matter.
Black lives matter.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.569
Black lives matter.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.311
- We will not stand...

25:30.354 --> 25:31.573
- That's right!
- Yeah.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.140
- For this
outrageous behavior...

25:33.183 --> 25:34.445
- Right.
- Yes, sir.

25:34.489 --> 25:37.448
- And the utter contempt...

25:37.492 --> 25:40.277
and disregard for black lives.

25:40.321 --> 25:42.236
- Yes.
- That's right.

25:42.279 --> 25:43.672
- Because black lives matter.

25:43.716 --> 25:45.326
all:
Black lives matter.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.762
Black lives matter.

25:46.806 --> 25:50.592
Black lives matter.
Black lives matter.

25:50.636 --> 25:52.115
Black lives matter.

25:52.159 --> 25:55.641
Black lives matter.
- Black lives matter.

25:55.684 --> 25:56.946
all: Black lives matter.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.781
- Hey, man.

26:05.825 --> 26:07.435
You okay?

26:07.478 --> 26:10.438
- Good.
- How'd it go with IRT?

26:10.481 --> 26:12.440
- Talk to 'em about everything.
- Uh-huh.

26:12.483 --> 26:13.310
- Off the record.

26:13.354 --> 26:14.529
They told me to watch the tape

26:14.573 --> 26:15.704
before I make an official
statement.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.663
- Hmm.

26:17.706 --> 26:19.055
Get any sleep?

26:19.099 --> 26:20.927
- No, not really.

26:20.970 --> 26:24.626
I got a bad taste
on this one, Sarge.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.586
No matter how you slice it,
I got an innocent man killed,

26:27.629 --> 26:29.413
a man who didn't do
a damn thing to deserve it.

26:29.457 --> 26:33.026
- What happened last night
was unfortunate.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.419
- No, it was not unfortunate.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.204
That was murder.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.598
- Well, you haven't seen
the tape, neither have I.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.296
- What are you saying?

26:42.339 --> 26:44.254
- I'm saying I'm not ready to
accuse a cop,

26:44.298 --> 26:46.648
one of our own, of murder
until I know all the facts.

26:46.692 --> 26:50.086
- That cop ain't one of us,
Sarge.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.697
- Yeah, maybe.

26:53.568 --> 26:54.482
I'll tell you what,

26:54.525 --> 26:56.310
Daryl definitely ain't
one of us.

26:56.353 --> 27:00.140
That is a stone-cold criminal,
puts bodies on the street,

27:00.183 --> 27:01.837
gets young kids
hooked on heroin.

27:01.881 --> 27:05.580
- He wasn't being a criminal
when he got shot.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.190
That's the point.

27:14.328 --> 27:17.026
- Kelton's blaming you for
what happened to Daryl.

27:17.070 --> 27:19.289
Thinks you should have
identified yourself

27:19.333 --> 27:21.988
as a police officer to
deescalate the situation.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.512
- Unbelievable.
- Mm-hmm.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.427
Mm-hmm.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.343
- After all of this
I'm the bad guy.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.997
Sarge, you know that Kelton
doesn't care about

27:31.040 --> 27:32.563
a damn thing,
but that election.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.740
- Yeah, I know that.

27:34.783 --> 27:37.830
But it doesn't matter.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.614
But if we bust Gamble,

27:39.658 --> 27:42.704
we give Kelton something to
talk about, to brag about.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.186
- That dirties Daryl,

27:46.229 --> 27:47.666
makes the whole situation
less tragic.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.624
- Uh-huh, yeah, that too.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.235
Well, let's face it.

27:52.279 --> 27:56.065
There is no easy answer
on this; there just isn't.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.725
- Let's finish this thing then.
- Good.

28:03.769 --> 28:07.033
So, go pay your respects
to Daryl's family.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.425
- What?

28:08.469 --> 28:11.820
- Go to his aunt's house,
connect with Gamble,

28:11.864 --> 28:14.954
and close that heroin deal
with him instead of Daryl.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.839
- Laz.
- Hey, yo.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.449
What up, Kev?

28:33.929 --> 28:35.757
- Did what I could do.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.498
- Appreciate you.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.630
- All right.
- Come on in.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.766
- Hi.
- Thank you for coming.

28:44.810 --> 28:47.900
- Thank you for having me,
Mama Donna.

28:57.039 --> 29:01.609
Vance...I'm sorry, bro.

29:01.652 --> 29:04.177
I did the best I could
to help him, it got crazy.

29:04.220 --> 29:06.788
- Right.

29:10.705 --> 29:13.795
- I didn't know Daryl
that well...

29:13.839 --> 29:17.712
But I do know he loved you.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.935
Hey, your brother didn't smile
that much, man,

29:22.978 --> 29:25.981
but every time I brought
you up...

29:26.025 --> 29:29.158
He smiled with pride.

29:30.420 --> 29:34.598
That's all it was, pure pride.

29:37.166 --> 29:41.649
- Vance, your ti-ti
needs you, man.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.651
- Go be strong.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.005
- You got it, man.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.536
They were sweating us
for no reason,

29:59.580 --> 30:01.756
and then a robbery call
came over the radio.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.498
And they really went crazy,
like that justified everything

30:04.541 --> 30:06.805
they wanted to do to us
in the first place.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.328
- Same ol' song, man.

30:08.371 --> 30:11.070
- You know how it goes,
trying to provoke us.

30:11.113 --> 30:13.376
I think Daryl caught onto that
before I did, which...

30:13.420 --> 30:17.641
made him
get aggressive and...

30:17.685 --> 30:20.383
did what he did, you know?

30:22.037 --> 30:24.126
- I loved Daryl, man,

30:24.170 --> 30:26.346
like he was my own flesh
and blood.

30:30.219 --> 30:33.614
He gone now, so...life goes on.

30:35.094 --> 30:38.880
It ain't right.
It just is what it is.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.664
- Yeah.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.884
Life does go on.

30:42.928 --> 30:46.409
So, in that spirit,
Daryl did put down 20%

30:46.453 --> 30:48.759
on a buy that was supposed
to get done that night.

30:50.979 --> 30:53.460
Talked to my homie, Tony,
you can have your money back

30:53.503 --> 30:55.070
or proceed with
the transaction.

30:55.114 --> 30:56.593
It's up to you.

30:57.768 --> 31:01.816
- Yo, Kev, you're all about
business, huh?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.687
I like that.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.909
- So, what do you want me
to tell Tony?

31:13.306 --> 31:15.047
- You know what?

31:15.090 --> 31:16.744
Set it up.
- All right.

31:16.787 --> 31:19.181
Gotchu.
- Let me know.

31:27.363 --> 31:29.191
- Mm.

31:29.235 --> 31:31.411
- It's the best in the Midwest.

31:33.804 --> 31:36.720
- Let the street decide that,
eh?

31:36.764 --> 31:38.897
This is you.

31:38.940 --> 31:39.985
- Okay.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.508
- It's good doing business
with you.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.379
- You two leave out the back.
- Yeah.

31:43.423 --> 31:44.772
That's good business, man.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.078
Now that's how we do it.
I see you.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.514
I see you, baby.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.429
- Chicago PD, don't move.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.692
- Freeze!

31:51.735 --> 31:53.085
Drop the bag,
hands in the air.

31:53.128 --> 31:54.477
- Whoa.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.219
- Against the car.

31:57.263 --> 31:59.613
- Oh, you lying son of a bitch.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.571
You set Daryl up, huh?

32:01.615 --> 32:04.096
You got him killed?

32:04.139 --> 32:06.881
Man, how you gonna do this to
your own people, man?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.362
You're worse than the cop
that pulled the trigger, Kev.

32:09.405 --> 32:11.146
I see you.

32:12.060 --> 32:15.411
- Hey, great work, Kev.
We got him.

32:15.455 --> 32:16.673
- Yeah, we got him.

32:16.717 --> 32:19.502
That's all that matters,
getting him,

32:19.546 --> 32:21.678
no matter what it costs.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.150
- You okay?

33:01.240 --> 33:03.111
- So, what do you think?

33:04.199 --> 33:06.810
- Just trying to sort it
all out, man.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.987
- Is the video helping
or hurting?

33:14.340 --> 33:17.996
- The video can't hear what
the punk ass cop was saying.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.258
I blinked the wrong way,

33:19.301 --> 33:21.390
that white boy would have
shot me.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.131
Killed me dead.
I mean, you look at the video.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.003
Maybe Daryl is lunging
for the cop's gun,

33:25.046 --> 33:27.092
but it should
have never got that far.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.138
- Mm-hmm.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.145
I'm glad you didn't blink
the wrong way.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.236
Look, I know you're gonna be
under a lot of pressure

33:41.280 --> 33:44.196
to do the right thing
from your community,

33:44.239 --> 33:46.676
your friends, your family.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.157
Police, on the other side,
they expect you to act

33:49.201 --> 33:51.551
a certain way,
back up your fellow officer.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.074
- Where do you stand?

33:55.598 --> 33:59.254
- It's tough to say,
because I'm white.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.345
And no matter how hard I try
or how badly I wanna understand

34:03.389 --> 34:07.219
what just happened,
what you just experienced,

34:07.262 --> 34:08.655
I can't.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.615
I never will.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.274
But I got your back, always.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.582
Either way, I got your back.

34:24.366 --> 34:28.501
- Thanks a lot.
Needed that.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.258
Hello?

34:48.912 --> 34:51.393
Okay, I'll be there.

34:51.437 --> 34:54.744
- Congratulations on
taking down Phil Gamble.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.833
Ooh, that son of a bitch
has been

34:56.877 --> 34:58.270
a pain in my ass for years.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.707
- Well, I'm glad we can help.
- Mm-hmm.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.362
- I'm assuming that's not why
you called me down here.

35:04.841 --> 35:07.366
- No.

35:09.019 --> 35:11.544
I wanna talk to you about
the police shooting.

35:13.198 --> 35:16.897
Your statement will carry
a lot of weight...

35:16.940 --> 35:19.813
will add lots of
important context to

35:19.856 --> 35:21.249
a complicated situation.

35:21.293 --> 35:25.819
So, as you begin to sort
through things,

35:25.862 --> 35:27.864
I wanna make sure
you feel protected.

35:27.908 --> 35:29.605
- Protected from what?

35:29.649 --> 35:33.261
- The truth, your truth...

35:33.305 --> 35:37.004
Whether or not it actually is
the truth.

35:37.047 --> 35:38.440
- You're asking me to lie?

35:38.484 --> 35:40.703
- No, I'm asking you
to be strong.

35:40.747 --> 35:43.532
To do what's necessary to
punish these racist punks

35:43.576 --> 35:46.056
who killed one of our own
for no reason.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.151
- Good to see you again, Ray.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.456
- Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.154
- Why is it so important
to you?

35:56.197 --> 35:57.155
You the one who told us to go
after Daryl

35:57.198 --> 35:58.634
in the first place.

35:58.678 --> 36:00.070
Thought you couldn't stand
his ass, remember?

36:00.114 --> 36:01.637
- I did.

36:01.681 --> 36:04.988
And the truth is, I don't give
a damn about his death.

36:05.032 --> 36:07.469
But I do care about a white cop

36:07.513 --> 36:09.602
killing a black man for
no reason.

36:14.215 --> 36:15.738
- There's a video out there
that shows

36:15.782 --> 36:18.001
Daryl lunging for that gun.

36:18.045 --> 36:19.351
It's tough to get around.

36:19.394 --> 36:21.048
- You don't have to worry about
none of that.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.093
You just speak your piece.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.663
I've done research on this cop,
Doyle.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.230
He's got a track record.

36:29.274 --> 36:33.103
He's been written up for
using the 'N' word before.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.802
So, you are gonna
tell COPA that

36:35.845 --> 36:38.935
you heard him use the word,

36:38.979 --> 36:40.328
that he told his partner
he was gonna

36:40.372 --> 36:41.677
"take care of those black boys"

36:41.721 --> 36:43.853
the second he got out of
his patrol car.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.551
And we'll be fine.

36:45.594 --> 36:49.511
We'll have intent, nullify that
video you're worried about.

36:49.555 --> 36:53.298
This isn't about you anymore,
Kevin.

36:55.474 --> 36:58.128
This is about
the future of Chicago.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.956
- Future of Chicago?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.784
- Mm-hmm.

37:04.526 --> 37:07.399
I've decided I'm gonna run
for Mayor.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.709
And this is the thing
that's gonna get us elected.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.250
- Got a call from COPA.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.603
They wanna talk to you today.

37:39.779 --> 37:43.130
- That's fine.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.746
- You all set?

37:54.837 --> 37:58.145
Look, I know you got people
talking in both your ears.

38:01.714 --> 38:04.630
You gotta do what you think
is right.

38:07.285 --> 38:12.115
Just...just keep in mind
you're a cop.

38:15.684 --> 38:19.253
That's what you get paid for,
not to change the world.

38:22.082 --> 38:26.042
- I just thought that's what
we were supposed to do...

38:26.086 --> 38:28.175
make the world better.

38:30.482 --> 38:35.225
- Just...remember
this is Chicago.

38:37.184 --> 38:39.360
It's not easy to be
an idealist.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.505
- Officer Atwater,
please tell us what

38:53.548 --> 38:56.638
you witnessed the night of
February 5th.

39:04.603 --> 39:06.822
- How you doing?
- What's up, man?

39:16.441 --> 39:17.659
- What the hell are you
doing here?

39:17.703 --> 39:19.400
- I talked to COPA today.
- Yeah, so what?

39:19.444 --> 39:21.576
You're coming down here--
you're gonna brag about it?

39:21.620 --> 39:24.362
- I told 'em it was
a good shoot.

39:28.453 --> 39:32.021
You?

39:32.065 --> 39:33.806
You backed me?

39:33.849 --> 39:37.375
- I told the truth.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.381
- I appreciate that, bro.

39:43.424 --> 39:45.383
- Don't call me "bro."

39:54.174 --> 39:57.525
No, I didn't come down here
to shake hands and make up.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.530
- Oh.
So it's like that, huh?

40:02.574 --> 40:05.925
- Yeah, it's like that.

40:05.968 --> 40:07.840
Let's go.

40:21.810 --> 40:23.421
Hey, look, man,
we don't gotta do this.

40:23.464 --> 40:24.422
- Oh.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.306
- You put a gun to my head.

40:40.612 --> 40:42.744
Hey, you might not go down
for that murder,

40:42.788 --> 40:44.790
but I will get your badge
one way or the other.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.498
- How does that feel?

40:57.542 --> 40:59.761
Huh?

40:59.805 --> 41:02.851
- Feel like a man?
Huh, boy?
