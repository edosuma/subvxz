WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.959
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:05.041 --> 00:06.542
I've found your birth father!

00:06.625 --> 00:10.083
(Randall) Few people in your technopathy
trial... there were side effects.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.125
He's allergic to technology.

00:13.875 --> 00:16.041
There are 30 more just like him,

00:16.125 --> 00:17.959
and if you can't cure them, they'll die.

00:18.041 --> 00:22.583
If this didn't work, tell Ryan...
(grunts)

00:22.667 --> 00:24.667
-Violet!
-Hold her down!

00:28.625 --> 00:30.041
Easy... easy...

00:30.125 --> 00:33.041
Mark,
rotate torso two degrees to the left.

00:33.125 --> 00:34.458
On it.

00:44.041 --> 00:47.750
-(Mark) Two halves of robot are connected.
-You are welcome.

00:47.834 --> 00:52.500
Oh, I'm sorry. Did... Did one of you
have a half-jaguar, half-dinosaur

00:52.583 --> 00:55.000
fly the pieces of the robot
back to Bay City?

00:55.083 --> 00:57.291
(Harper) I am gonna go make sure
the junctures hold.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.333
(whooshing)

00:59.417 --> 01:00.792
-Harp execute.
-Stop it.

01:00.875 --> 01:02.041
-No.
-Never gonna be a thing.

01:02.125 --> 01:04.959
Are you sure?
It sounds kind of like a thing.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.667
(beeping)

01:16.917 --> 01:20.750
Nice.
I'm always amazed to see that power work.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.417
(Harper)
You know what's cool about that fist?

01:23.500 --> 01:26.709
The Harper punch will be three times
more powerful than your plasma punch.

01:26.792 --> 01:28.667
We are not calling it the Harper punch.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.583
It sounds like...
the worst juice drink ever.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.792
And, dude,
you're not a member of this team.

01:33.875 --> 01:35.250
-Because I dated your mom?
-No.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.750
'Cause you tried to destroy world.

01:36.834 --> 01:38.000
Ah, details.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.709
Look, remember the deal?
You use your money and your tech

01:40.792 --> 01:42.917
to upgrade the robot, I take down Traeger,

01:43.000 --> 01:44.500
and it's game on between you and me.

01:44.583 --> 01:47.291
Whoa! Look, who got all alpha on me.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.625
Look out puberty, here comes Ryan.
Am I right?

01:50.709 --> 01:52.375
Okay. I get it.

01:52.458 --> 01:55.417
I get it, but we have a problem.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.458
The control panel,
it's still a little glitchy.

01:57.542 --> 02:00.041
None of us can figure it out.
Leo may be one who can fix it.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.792
-So, where is he?
-No clue.

02:02.875 --> 02:04.875
It's cool.
I'll take another look at the pad.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.291
-Harp execute.
-That's not a thing.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.250
Kind of feels like a thing.

02:09.333 --> 02:12.959
-Who made that a thing?
-I think I just made it a thing!

02:15.250 --> 02:16.959
-(Mech link beeps)
-(Leo) Ryan.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.959
Is he gone? Good.
He can't know where I am. It's dangerous.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.792
I've programmed Mark's car
to fly you here.

02:23.875 --> 02:25.417
Me, why? What's going on?

02:25.500 --> 02:27.542
Ryan, I'm with your birth parents.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.625
Your mother is... very sick.

02:31.709 --> 02:33.834
You need to get here before it's too late.

02:36.166 --> 02:39.166
(theme music playing)

03:23.333 --> 03:24.417
Weird.

03:26.792 --> 03:27.667
I lost my signal.

03:28.834 --> 03:29.875
-Hi, there!
-Aah!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.583
Seriously, even here?

03:31.667 --> 03:32.875
Yeah, even out here.

03:32.959 --> 03:34.375
Where is here, anyway?

03:34.458 --> 03:35.417
It's home.

03:37.417 --> 03:38.500
Randall?

03:38.583 --> 03:40.875
I... I mean, Dad?

03:40.959 --> 03:43.542
I mean...
Haven't really figured that out yet.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.208
It's good to see you, Ryan.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.792
Remember the mine?

03:51.875 --> 03:54.375
This ore blocks
signals from the outside world.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.625
But we still have to live away
from civilization.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.834
I need you to put all your tech
in that well before you meet the others.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.250
The others?

04:01.333 --> 04:04.291
Thirty of the volunteers
I used in my technopathy experiments,

04:04.375 --> 04:06.166
and it made them allergic to technology.

04:06.250 --> 04:09.333
Leo, your experiment made people sick?
That's terrible.

04:09.417 --> 04:13.041
Yeah. Yeah, but not everybody.
I mean, Randall's fine.

04:13.125 --> 04:15.458
Ryan, you gotta remember,
I was testing on a lot of people,

04:15.542 --> 04:17.458
so, statistically, it, um...

04:20.333 --> 04:21.458
it's still pretty terrible.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.875
(Leo) But that's the reason
why I brought you out there.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.417
There's a chance we can use
your technopathy to cure them.

04:33.291 --> 04:36.333
You guys leavin'? Where you goin'?
You got plans? Are you free?

04:36.417 --> 04:38.250
-I don't trust this.
-What do you mean?

04:38.333 --> 04:39.709
You never just hang out with us.

04:39.792 --> 04:42.917
But Harper's upgrading the robot,
we can't do anything until Ryan gets back.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.959
Is it possible he just wants to hang out?

04:45.041 --> 04:47.959
-Or his girlfriend dumped him?
-(laughing)

04:50.917 --> 04:54.041
Aw, no. I did the thing, didn't I?

04:54.125 --> 04:55.750
Where I accidentally guessed the truth?

04:55.834 --> 04:58.959
(sighs)
Aw, dang. Mark Walker got dumped.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.750
I ghosted on her in the Arctic.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.834
It's not like I could tell her why.

05:04.917 --> 05:08.834
And... honestly, we have so much to do,
I'm gonna have to keep on ghosting on her.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.250
But... you're right.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.500
I really don't wanna hang out.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.083
(sighs)
I hate this.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.875
Mark and Georgia were perfect together.

05:19.959 --> 05:22.333
If they can't make it,
what hope do you and Veracity have?

05:22.417 --> 05:23.333
-What?
-Are you insane?

05:23.417 --> 05:24.875
Okay, whatever you need to believe.

05:24.959 --> 05:27.333
-Spyder does have a point.
-Ew. No.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.625
No, about Mark.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.291
-Ah.
-He's always helping us.

05:30.375 --> 05:33.083
We should pay back a favor.
We just have to be smart about this.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.208
-I'll get the arm cannons.
-Yeah... What? No.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.375
-(Harris) Please don't.
-I'm gonna observe from a distance.

05:41.291 --> 05:44.125
(Randall) We grow our own food here,
we're totally self-sufficient.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.375
I hate to be a wet blanket,
but the food is terrible.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.166
That's the least of our concerns, though.

05:48.250 --> 05:51.709
(Leo) Weeks ago, they didn't like me
because they didn't know me.

05:51.792 --> 05:54.291
Then they learned I'm the reason
they're all sick.

05:54.375 --> 05:55.834
And now they like you less.

05:55.917 --> 05:59.083
-Hate. The word is hate.
-Oh.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.500
We're all dying, Leo.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.667
Were we supposed to just let that slide?

06:02.750 --> 06:04.417
Easy. Aaron.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.583
So... you must be Ryan.

06:11.834 --> 06:15.417
-This is Lincoln. She's our...
-She is our leader.

06:15.500 --> 06:21.375
Aaron, all I did was create this place
when I realized there were others like me.

06:22.291 --> 06:27.875
You... you are gonna make it possible
for us to rejoin society.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.166
And you think I can cure all of you?

06:33.083 --> 06:34.959
-I'll try.
-(sighs)

06:35.792 --> 06:37.333
But can I see my birth mother first?

06:38.250 --> 06:40.250
(murmuring)

06:40.417 --> 06:42.375
-What?
-(Randall) This way.

06:42.917 --> 06:44.250
She's resting now.

06:44.917 --> 06:47.208
I wish you could've met her
under better circumstances.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.417
Violet has so much she wants to tell you.

06:52.417 --> 06:55.500
I tried to cure her,
but nothing I did worked.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.458
-(Leo) Her condition keeps deteriorating.
-What can I do to help?

06:58.542 --> 07:01.291
Well, she's sick because her body
is producing technopathic energy,

07:01.375 --> 07:03.500
which you have the ability to manipulate,

07:03.583 --> 07:07.875
so, hopefully,
you'll be able to absorb it out of her.

07:11.667 --> 07:13.166
I'm sorry about your mother, Ryan.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.875
But we don't know what this procedure
will do to the patient.

07:17.959 --> 07:21.041
We should try it on someone younger,
stronger, less sick.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.917
-That does make sense, Ryan.
-Yeah, but...

07:23.000 --> 07:24.542
This is Brandi.

07:26.417 --> 07:28.875
They said you could make me feel better.

07:33.291 --> 07:34.375
I'm gonna try.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.750
Just do what you do
when you connect with the robot.

07:49.917 --> 07:51.542
(grunts)

07:53.625 --> 07:56.208
(Ryan grunting)

08:02.542 --> 08:03.959
(shouts)

08:04.041 --> 08:05.959
(panting)

08:14.500 --> 08:17.125
I don't feel sick anymore. I feel cured.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.041
You did it, Ryan. She's gonna be okay.

08:19.125 --> 08:21.959
Great. Who's... next?

08:22.041 --> 08:23.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

08:28.542 --> 08:30.208
(dogs barking)

08:33.458 --> 08:35.500
(Leo) His vitals are incredibly weak.

08:35.583 --> 08:39.125
That procedure, whatever Ryan did,
takes a toll on him.

08:39.208 --> 08:40.375
We have to let him rest.

08:40.458 --> 08:43.083
He can't help anyone
if he doesn't get better.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.375
-When will he be ready?
-We don't know yet.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.250
If he pushes himself too hard,
we don't know what's gonna happen.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.208
-He might get hurt.
-That's never stopped you before.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.500
Okay, Judge-y McJudge-y Pants, really?

08:53.583 --> 08:56.041
(Leo) I forgot after the 50th time
you told me. Grudge much?

09:00.458 --> 09:01.291
(sighs)

09:05.333 --> 09:07.792
(Spyder) Really apologetic delivery
from Mark Walker!

09:09.583 --> 09:10.625
(chuckles)

09:17.792 --> 09:19.875
-"Sorry for your loss"?
-Uh-oh.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.709
(huffs)
Did you steal those from a funeral home?

09:23.792 --> 09:25.834
-They weren't using them!
-(sighs)

09:25.917 --> 09:29.000
(cell phone rings)

09:29.083 --> 09:31.583
-Georgia?
-"Sorry for your loss"?

09:31.667 --> 09:33.375
"Deepest sympathies"?

09:33.458 --> 09:35.583
A card for a grief counselor!

09:35.667 --> 09:38.458
You think I need a grief counselor
just because I broke up with you?

09:38.542 --> 09:40.834
Lose my number, you arrogant jerk!

09:43.458 --> 09:46.583
How can a girl resist dozens of flowers?

09:46.667 --> 09:48.542
Sit back, watch the master work.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.834
(beeping)

09:53.083 --> 09:55.291
(buzzing)

09:58.083 --> 10:00.291
(beeping)

10:06.667 --> 10:07.625
Oh, no.

10:07.709 --> 10:09.375
-What?
-The wind!

10:09.458 --> 10:11.792
I didn't account for the wind!
It's changing the letters!

10:11.875 --> 10:13.792
(Spyder) "I want your love to die"?

10:13.875 --> 10:15.917
-(huffs)
-(Spyder) That's a little harsh, Harris.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.583
It's supposed to say "today."

10:17.667 --> 10:18.792
It's the wind!

10:19.959 --> 10:20.792
(phone chimes)

10:22.291 --> 10:25.500
Georgia. "I want your love to die"?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.625
What are those idiots doing?

10:42.709 --> 10:44.083
(grunts)

10:45.542 --> 10:47.125
(Leo) Ryan!

10:48.208 --> 10:50.959
Ryan... Ryan, you have to stop

10:51.041 --> 10:52.875
'cause I don't know
what it's doing to you!

10:52.959 --> 10:54.375
No, I'm going to save her!

10:58.291 --> 10:59.250
(shouts)

10:59.333 --> 11:00.959
(panting)

11:01.041 --> 11:02.333
(moans)

11:05.166 --> 11:06.083
Leo?

11:07.583 --> 11:08.458
Yeah.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.500
Yeah. And... there's someone
I really wanna introduce you to.

11:16.750 --> 11:17.750
Ryan...

11:19.291 --> 11:21.750
Randall told me about you.

11:24.792 --> 11:25.959
You're so warm.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.500
Um... hey.

11:29.583 --> 11:32.375
-(screams)
-Ryan!

11:32.458 --> 11:34.542
(electrical crackling)

11:38.959 --> 11:40.667
-(dogs barking)
-(coughs)

11:40.750 --> 11:42.834
Ryan? Ryan!

11:42.917 --> 11:44.125
(grunts)

11:44.208 --> 11:45.250
Ryan!

11:45.834 --> 11:48.291
(echoing)
Wake up! Ryan!

11:48.375 --> 11:49.375
(Violet) Ryan!

11:49.458 --> 11:51.375
(Ryan moaning)

11:54.291 --> 11:56.375
He's awake. He's awake!

12:01.542 --> 12:03.750
-How are you feeling?
-How do you feel?

12:03.834 --> 12:04.959
I asked you first.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.625
Randall told me what a brave kid you were,

12:08.709 --> 12:11.291
but... how could I imagine this?

12:11.375 --> 12:12.875
You saved me!

12:12.959 --> 12:15.458
You saved me when you gave me to Leo.

12:15.875 --> 12:17.583
I was just...
(coughing)

12:17.667 --> 12:19.208
I was just returning the favor.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.750
(door opens)

12:25.500 --> 12:28.959
Violet...
I didn't know Ryan had cured you already.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.000
I thought you said he was too sick
to proceed.

12:32.083 --> 12:35.208
He was. He did the procedure
before we could stop him.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.125
It could be killing him for all we know.

12:37.208 --> 12:40.000
I need to take him back to my lab
in Bay City to run some tests.

12:40.083 --> 12:44.291
-Leo's right.
-I knew this would happen.

12:45.417 --> 12:48.709
You cure your mother,
and you leave us behind.

12:50.834 --> 12:52.709
You're not going anywhere

12:52.792 --> 12:55.542
until you cure all of us.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.208
That could kill him!

12:57.291 --> 12:59.583
He's bounced back twice.
The procedure's safe.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.000
-Please listen to reason!
-(Lincoln) I am!

13:03.500 --> 13:05.250
Ryan cures all of us...

13:06.458 --> 13:08.250
or he'll never see
his birth parents again.

13:08.333 --> 13:11.000
-What? No, you...
-Wait! What are you doing?

13:11.083 --> 13:12.458
-No!
-No, let them go!

13:12.542 --> 13:14.667
-Ryan!
-Wait a sec! What are you doing?

13:14.750 --> 13:17.166
-(Violet) No!
-(groaning)

13:17.250 --> 13:18.333
(door slams)

13:22.792 --> 13:24.500
(grunting)

13:25.625 --> 13:27.000
(grunting)

13:27.083 --> 13:28.667
(shouts)

13:28.750 --> 13:30.375
(panting)

13:33.041 --> 13:35.166
Lincoln, you have to stop this.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.250
Ryan might die,
and if he does, no one else gets cured.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.792
(Lincoln) It's a terrible notion to learn
you have no control, isn't it, Leo?

13:42.750 --> 13:46.000
Make sure he stays here
until we bring back the next patient.

13:58.917 --> 13:59.750
Psst!

14:00.458 --> 14:01.333
Let's go.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.875
(dogs barking)

14:07.959 --> 14:10.125
I don't want you to get in any trouble
because of us.

14:10.208 --> 14:13.083
You said you'd come back. I believe you.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.458
-Go!
-Not without Randall and Violet safe.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.709
Do you know
where they took Ryan's parents?

14:17.792 --> 14:20.291
The farmhouse cellar. Over there.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.583
Okay, you, stay here with Ryan.

14:23.667 --> 14:26.375
I'll help them escape
before they realize we're gone.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.917
-Wait, Leo--
-No. Ryan! You're exhausted.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.542
Okay. You're only gonna slow me down.

14:30.625 --> 14:33.709
And this is where you learn that
Leo Mendel isn't just some crazy scientist

14:33.792 --> 14:35.000
-or former male model.
-What?

14:35.083 --> 14:38.583
Yeah. I'm also a lunatic man of action.

14:42.834 --> 14:45.250
We could slip subliminal
"I miss Mark Walker" messages

14:45.333 --> 14:46.250
into her video stream.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.291
As amusing as it has been
watching the two of you...

14:50.375 --> 14:51.834
How long have you been watching?

14:51.917 --> 14:54.041
Long enough to realize
that you will both die alone.

14:54.125 --> 14:57.750
-Ha.
-Excuse me. I'm gonna go use words.

14:57.834 --> 15:00.000
Here's a tip: don't skywrite them.

15:00.709 --> 15:01.959
Dang, son.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.709
-What's she saying?
-How would I know? I don't lip-read.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.875
Wait... I do lip-read!

15:16.250 --> 15:18.417
Whoa. Oh, my.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.917
Oh! This is escalating quickly.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.417
-Oh.
-Oh, uh...

15:22.500 --> 15:25.792
Uh, we should go, and we should go now,
before the police show up.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.000
Or worse.

15:29.458 --> 15:30.834
Your girlfriend's nice.

15:30.917 --> 15:32.333
(huffs)

15:33.542 --> 15:36.667
(owl hooting)

15:39.166 --> 15:40.500
(clattering)

15:42.667 --> 15:44.041
(grunts)

15:44.125 --> 15:46.166
Sucker punch from nowhere!

15:46.250 --> 15:47.333
Can't believe that worked.

15:47.417 --> 15:50.333
Okay. Sorry, sir.
Please, stay winded, sir.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.750
Okay...
(grunts)

15:52.834 --> 15:54.792
Come on!
I sucker punched this guy from nowhere.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.125
It's a move I just invented,
I can't believe it worked.

15:57.208 --> 15:59.083
We better get out of here... Oh!

15:59.166 --> 16:04.375
Please, Leo, you had to know
we'd never let you leave here alive.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.917
-(grunts)
-(groaning)

16:10.000 --> 16:12.750
-(electrical crackling)
-(groans)

16:12.834 --> 16:14.291
It's over!

16:18.166 --> 16:21.834
Even if you escape,
we will track you down eventually.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.125
Is this what we're doin' now?

16:28.125 --> 16:29.208
Kidnapping?

16:30.417 --> 16:31.291
Killing?

16:32.792 --> 16:36.500
She took my parents hostage
so I'd keep curing everyone!

16:36.583 --> 16:37.750
And it may be killing him.

16:37.834 --> 16:40.542
(Ryan) I thought you were supposed
to take care of each other!

16:40.625 --> 16:44.458
Enough! Everyone here has a choice.

16:44.542 --> 16:49.291
You can continue to live with the pain
that Leo inflicted on us,

16:49.375 --> 16:53.750
or you can take them to the barn
and wait to be cured!

16:54.792 --> 16:56.291
We can have our lives back.

16:57.291 --> 16:58.500
See our families.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.834
-If anyone touches my son, I'll...
-Don't do this!

17:07.917 --> 17:10.542
We're better than this.

17:10.625 --> 17:13.709
(murmuring)

17:17.417 --> 17:19.667
Randall is family!

17:20.291 --> 17:23.625
He goes into the outside world
and risks his life for us.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.000
And I volunteered for the trials
to help people,

17:27.542 --> 17:29.542
not hurt kids who saved my life.

17:31.709 --> 17:32.542
What?

17:33.542 --> 17:37.750
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go!

17:37.834 --> 17:40.500
(Lincoln) You will regret this! Let me go!

17:41.875 --> 17:42.709
Thank you.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.417
Don't thank me.

17:46.542 --> 17:47.709
Thank him.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.208
(scoffs)
Get lost.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.792
Wait. Just hear me out?

18:05.875 --> 18:08.792
All the weird stuff that's been happening,
it wasn't me.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.375
Somebody... decided to "help."

18:11.458 --> 18:14.083
Okay. It's just, the way you said help,

18:14.166 --> 18:16.166
makes it sound like
you don't think we did.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.625
-Because you didn't.
-Okay.

18:17.709 --> 18:22.083
Look, I know you don't wanna see me again,
and you won't.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.583
But I just wanna say, I'm sorry.

18:23.667 --> 18:26.291
For these guys annoying you, and...

18:26.375 --> 18:28.834
especially for ghosting on you.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.917
Then why did you?

18:31.000 --> 18:35.125
I have... responsibilities

18:35.208 --> 18:38.500
to my brother, to my family...

18:38.583 --> 18:40.458
and to these guys, I guess.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.875
Oh, you! Okay!

18:42.959 --> 18:43.792
(sniffs)

18:45.500 --> 18:47.083
It won't happen again.

18:47.166 --> 18:50.291
I didn't break up with you
because you're busy.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.291
I'm busy, too.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.458
I broke up with you
because you didn't tell me you were busy.

18:54.542 --> 18:56.792
You just... disappeared.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.625
It's called communication.

19:01.417 --> 19:03.500
Actually, that'd be called "multitasking,"

19:03.583 --> 19:07.417
but... maybe I'll just stay out of this,
for now.

19:07.500 --> 19:13.834
At least your friends tried to talk to me,
even if it was in that... insane way.

19:13.917 --> 19:17.000
Again, I am so sorry.
I didn't even know that I knew that word.

19:18.166 --> 19:21.083
-Do you get what I'm saying?
-Yeah.

19:21.166 --> 19:25.250
Well, then, I guess...

19:25.333 --> 19:27.291
I can give you another chance.

19:32.959 --> 19:34.792
-This is your cue to leave.
-Oh! Okay.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.834
-Um...
-Thank you.

19:36.917 --> 19:39.709
-(Spyder) Bye, Georgia!
-(Veracity) Have fun, you crazy kids!

19:41.125 --> 19:43.166
(Violet)
Can't you just stay a little bit longer?

19:44.083 --> 19:46.583
It would be nice to get to know you more.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.291
(sighs)
But there's still a threat out there.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.041
And I'm needed back in Bay City.

19:51.125 --> 19:53.583
You know, you guys could come with me.

19:53.667 --> 19:54.792
Soon, hopefully.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.917
Now that we expelled Lincoln,
this place is gonna need leadership.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.166
They took care of me
when I needed it, son.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.333
We need to help them now.

20:01.417 --> 20:04.000
People that need you... I get it.

20:04.083 --> 20:08.250
Now that I know how you can be cured,
I should be able to develop a better way,

20:08.333 --> 20:12.458
a faster one, uh,
one that doesn't, you know, make Ryan die.

20:12.542 --> 20:14.834
That'd be great,
because dead would be a bummer.

20:14.917 --> 20:17.333
(chuckles)
Okay.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.083
Come back soon.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.250
Cure or no cure,
we've lost too many years already.

20:26.166 --> 20:30.417
Randall was right about you.
You are one special kid.

20:33.750 --> 20:35.417
Goodbye, Ryan.

20:39.792 --> 20:40.709
For now.

20:42.041 --> 20:44.583
(engine starts)

20:44.667 --> 20:46.667
(car beeping, trilling)

20:49.458 --> 20:51.875
(whirring)

21:17.500 --> 21:19.291
(grunting)

21:29.083 --> 21:31.917
(alarm blaring)

21:35.667 --> 21:36.542
Hmm.

21:39.375 --> 21:40.500
(grunts)

21:42.625 --> 21:45.375
(screams)

21:45.458 --> 21:49.083
Please, don't take that.
You don't know what it can do.

21:49.166 --> 21:50.959
I know exactly what it does.

21:51.041 --> 21:52.834
Do you know what I can do?

21:53.583 --> 21:55.667
(alarm blaring)

22:03.375 --> 22:08.375
(theme music playing)

22:29.417 --> 22:30.250
(barking)
