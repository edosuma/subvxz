00:01.750 --> 00:03.458
So, his dad just died?

00:03.542 --> 00:04.667
Just like that?

00:04.750 --> 00:05.959
GERALD:
Yeah, heart attack.

00:06.041 --> 00:07.792
He's on the phone
with the hospital now.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.041
BOTH:
Oh, it's so sad.

00:09.125 --> 00:11.041
Jinx.

00:11.125 --> 00:12.250
Do you think he's okay?

00:12.333 --> 00:13.417
When my dad died,

00:13.500 --> 00:14.875
I watched<i> When Harry Met Sally </i>

00:14.959 --> 00:16.375
for 48 hours straight,

00:16.458 --> 00:17.959
and<i> City Slickers </i>
for the next 72.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.875
My dad really looked
like Billy Crystal.

00:20.959 --> 00:21.959
GERALD:
Here he comes.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.959
ALL (cheerfully):
Hi.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.375
So, my dad's dead, you know.

00:26.458 --> 00:27.917
It was a heart attack; sudden.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.834
Oh, honey, I'm-I'm so sorry.

00:29.917 --> 00:30.959
Where is the funeral?

00:31.041 --> 00:32.125
You know, I can clear
my schedule

00:32.208 --> 00:33.583
for next week...

00:33.667 --> 00:34.959
No, no, no, no, there
won't be any funeral.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.583
I mean, we didn't
have much family, so...

00:36.667 --> 00:38.041
it's fine, you know.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.667
Jimmy, you know, if you ever
want to sit and just...

00:39.750 --> 00:41.875
Ravi, it's life, okay?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.166
I'm gonna be just fine,
you guys.

00:43.250 --> 00:44.625
Don't worry about me; I'm good.

00:44.709 --> 00:45.875
Let's talk about something else.

00:45.959 --> 00:47.166
All right,
so what's new?

00:47.250 --> 00:49.667
Oh, Cinco de Mayo right
around the corner, huh?

00:49.750 --> 00:51.709
We having any taquito parties
this year?

00:51.792 --> 00:53.917
Hmm?
Really, you don't want
to have a funeral?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.250
It could be cathartic.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.625
I'm fine.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.291
You know, i-it's sad,
yes, but...

00:58.375 --> 00:59.583
I have no regrets.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.792
I mean, like I always say...

01:01.875 --> 01:03.250
it's the circle of life,
you know?

01:03.333 --> 01:04.166
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

01:04.250 --> 01:05.166
Mm-hmm,<i> hakuna matata. </i>

01:05.250 --> 01:06.542
Exactly.

01:06.625 --> 01:10.917
Look, everybody, my dad
had a long life...

01:11.000 --> 01:12.083
And...?

01:12.166 --> 01:13.917
That's it. Vodka martinis?
Anyone?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.542
Oh, was that your
dad's favorite drink?

01:15.625 --> 01:17.333
Yeah. Not anymore.
(wry chuckle)

01:21.834 --> 01:24.125
Okay, wh-what was that?

01:24.208 --> 01:26.333
You have so much
to learn, new girl.

01:26.417 --> 01:29.709
Jimmy Martino is not an
emotionally mature adult.

01:29.792 --> 01:32.417
Instead of mourning,
he makes rash life decisions,

01:32.500 --> 01:34.750
usually involving
the restaurant or himself.

01:34.834 --> 01:36.208
When Paul Newman died,

01:36.291 --> 01:39.375
he put in a sushi conveyor belt
and grew a ponytail.

01:39.458 --> 01:40.959
Guys, call me crazy,
but I think this area over here

01:41.041 --> 01:42.750
needs a little sprucing up, huh?

01:42.834 --> 01:44.166
You know what
I'm thinking?

01:44.250 --> 01:45.166
Fish tank.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.333
What I'm seeing is sort of a...

01:47.417 --> 01:49.542
a wide tank, like so...

01:49.625 --> 01:51.500
maybe some sea anemones...

01:51.583 --> 01:53.709
a sea otter here...

01:53.792 --> 01:54.709
maybe a shark.

01:54.792 --> 01:55.959
Oh, sharks are sexy.

01:56.041 --> 01:56.959
(sighs)

01:57.041 --> 01:58.166
I wish mermaids were real.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.500
We don't have
to decide now,

01:59.583 --> 02:00.959
we can let it, you know,

02:01.041 --> 02:02.959
"perk-u-late," or... percolate.

02:03.041 --> 02:04.875
This is still better
than the ponytail.

02:05.000 --> 02:05.917
Percolate,
perk-u-late,

02:06.000 --> 02:07.333
perk-u-late, percolate.

02:07.417 --> 02:08.458
We'll table it.

02:08.542 --> 02:11.083

02:13.000 --> 02:13.917
RAVI:

02:14.000 --> 02:16.417
(gasps)
What-- uh, nothing.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.000
Looks like you're putting
a tiny box in Jimmy's safe.

02:19.083 --> 02:20.250
(deep voice):
What's in the box?

02:20.333 --> 02:23.000
What's in the box?!
(laughs)

02:23.083 --> 02:24.458

Seriously,
color me, uh, intrigued.

02:28.291 --> 02:30.000
What's in that ring box?

02:30.083 --> 02:30.959
Can you keep a secret?

02:31.041 --> 02:32.000
Bro, are you kidding me?

02:32.083 --> 02:33.458
My soccer coach, he paid me

02:33.542 --> 02:35.000
to sit on his lap
for an entire summer...

02:35.083 --> 02:36.917
you're, like, the first person
I've ever told.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.041
Yeah, I can keep
your little secret.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.083
Horrifying.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.667
Okay, um, it's a ring.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.000
I'm gonna propose to Vanessa.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.000
(laughing):
What?

02:44.083 --> 02:45.709
Dude, that's awesome!
Yeah!

02:45.792 --> 02:47.959
Ah, man, if her grandma
is any indication,

02:48.041 --> 02:50.333
she is gonna ripen like
a peach in the Georgia sun.

02:50.417 --> 02:51.917
When are you popping
the question?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.125
Well, you know, I was
gonna do it right away,

02:53.208 --> 02:55.041
but then Jimmy's dad died,

02:55.125 --> 02:57.041
and I feel like I should wait
a couple weeks, out of respect.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.917
Wait, what, I'm supposed to sit
on this for a couple weeks?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.041
Nuh-uh, no, no, I can't do that,
you know I can't keep a secret.

03:01.125 --> 03:03.208
You just said that you kept your
soccer coach thing a secret.

03:03.291 --> 03:04.583
I lied, man.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.041
I told everyone
about my soccer coach.

03:06.125 --> 03:07.667
I even made some things up.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.041
As soon as I see Vanessa,

03:09.125 --> 03:10.625
I'm gonna freak out
and I'm gonna blow it.

03:10.709 --> 03:12.041
Yeah, but, you see
Vanessa all the time.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.333
I'm gonna blow it!

03:13.417 --> 03:15.041
Okay, uh...

03:15.125 --> 03:16.750
you know, maybe it's not
too soon to propose, right?

03:16.834 --> 03:18.458
Uh, maybe my dad's
feeling okay now.

03:18.542 --> 03:20.000
Right?
Hoo-hoo! Hi, guys!

03:20.083 --> 03:22.041
I've been up baking
all night long.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.208
Dad, you have
some flour on your...

03:23.291 --> 03:24.333
Did I get it?

03:24.417 --> 03:25.834
Mm-hmm.
Good.

03:25.917 --> 03:27.417
Listen, I'm working
on a new specialty dish,

03:27.500 --> 03:28.458
and-and I asked myself:

03:28.542 --> 03:29.583
Is it a pasta? No.

03:29.667 --> 03:30.583
Is it a steak? No.

03:30.667 --> 03:31.583
What I'm doing is...

03:31.667 --> 03:32.583
I'm taking a winter classic

03:32.667 --> 03:33.667
and I'm bringing it

03:33.750 --> 03:36.000
all the way back
to summer, baby.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.792
Look at this:
gingerbread beach house.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.083
What do you think?
Hmm...

03:39.166 --> 03:40.917
Good. I'm gonna go
update the menu,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
and, uh, tell me when the
fish tank gets in, will you?

03:44.375 --> 03:47.083
Guys, how do you think
I'd look as a blond?

03:47.166 --> 03:49.166
And-and do they do
that surgery for men,

03:49.250 --> 03:51.083
that-that permanent
eyeliner surgery...

03:51.166 --> 03:52.375
I wore eyeliner
in a high school play,

03:52.458 --> 03:53.875
and I got to tell you,

03:53.959 --> 03:55.166
I made me feel
<i>very </i>sexually free.

03:57.542 --> 03:58.542
Hey.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.000
We should talk
about Dad, right?

04:02.083 --> 04:05.083
Yeah, uh, he keeps
sending me these crazy texts.

04:05.166 --> 04:07.083
"Do you think I would
look good as a blond?

04:07.166 --> 04:09.458
"I'll have Annelise
do a mock-up.

04:09.542 --> 04:10.834
Here's the mock-up."

04:10.917 --> 04:12.208
Oh, God!

04:12.291 --> 04:13.709
He looks like Glenn Close.

04:13.792 --> 04:15.125
Uh, we need to pull
him out of this.

04:15.208 --> 04:16.917
Right? Help him deal
with his grief

04:17.000 --> 04:18.125
i-i-in a healthier way.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.959
(phone ringing)

04:20.041 --> 04:21.583
It's him.

04:21.667 --> 04:23.125
Hey, Dad.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.125
I don't think you should
get that surgery.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.208
Wha...?

04:26.291 --> 04:27.917
Because your jawline's

04:28.000 --> 04:29.291
already very well-defined.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.166
Oh, hey.
Hi.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.166
There you are.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.375
How was your day?

04:34.458 --> 04:35.917
Well...

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
I feel like I spent most
of it driving over here.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.000
Oh.
Who knew Santa Monica

04:40.083 --> 04:43.500
to Pasadena counts as a
long-distance relationship?

04:43.583 --> 04:45.291
I don't understand why I'm
driving so far to be with you...

04:45.375 --> 04:47.125
Hey, screw you, jerk face!

04:47.208 --> 04:49.125
I drove out to Santa Monica
on Tuesday.

04:49.208 --> 04:51.208
...because I want to be
with you all the time.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.625
Oops.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.625
Hmm.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.166
I should never talk.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.250
Hey, listen...

04:58.291 --> 05:00.875
I think we should move
in together.

05:00.959 --> 05:02.875
You do?
Yeah.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.166
Isn't it a little soon?

05:04.250 --> 05:06.709
Maybe, but I know what I want,

05:06.792 --> 05:08.250
and I want you, so why wait?

05:09.583 --> 05:11.375
Look, take some time,
think about it.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.500
Okay, I'll think about it.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.208
Mm!

05:17.291 --> 05:19.542
(phone chimes)

05:19.625 --> 05:20.834
Ugh.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.709
Oh, is that Billy Idol?

05:22.792 --> 05:23.709
Love him.

05:23.792 --> 05:26.125
(sighs)
Yikes.

05:28.709 --> 05:30.083
Oh, my God, he bought fish.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.709
Yeah, for my new fish tank.

05:31.792 --> 05:32.959
Fishies!

05:33.041 --> 05:34.000
Wait a minute,

05:34.083 --> 05:35.250
how did all you guys

05:35.333 --> 05:36.333
get into my apartment?

05:41.083 --> 05:42.875
An emotional intervention?
Come on.

05:42.959 --> 05:45.000
Whose idea was this?

05:45.083 --> 05:47.500
Not yours because
you're too cool.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.625
He's right, I am.

05:48.709 --> 05:49.417
You don't like me enough.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.500
He's right, I don't.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.542
And you don't like to share me,

05:51.625 --> 05:52.917
so if this was your idea,

05:53.000 --> 05:54.041
it'd be just the
two of us somewhere...

05:54.125 --> 05:55.792
Dolphin-watching
for two in Catalina.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.000
Leaves every hour
if you still want to go.

05:58.000 --> 05:58.959
This whole nonsense

05:59.041 --> 06:00.917
has you two hippy-dippy nerds

06:01.000 --> 06:02.542
written all over it.

06:02.625 --> 06:03.333
You need help.

06:03.417 --> 06:04.333
Mom's a therapist;

06:04.417 --> 06:05.792
she knows this stuff.

06:05.875 --> 06:07.458
Look at you, you're baking
your pain away.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.125
Let us throw a memorial

06:09.208 --> 06:10.291
for your dad so you can
give him a proper good-bye.

06:10.375 --> 06:11.917
No.
Mom and I will handle

06:12.000 --> 06:13.458
everything, all right?
We will invite everyone,

06:13.542 --> 06:15.625
and, yeah, Edie will help...

06:15.709 --> 06:16.959
we'll deck out the restaurant,

06:17.041 --> 06:19.667
it'll be a blast...
of appropriate sadness.

06:20.917 --> 06:21.750
Yeah.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.083
A memorial?

06:24.041 --> 06:27.125
All right, a memorial.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.500
I'll do anything to get
you guys out of my apartment.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.917
Oh, great, Jimmy,
all you have to do

06:32.000 --> 06:34.333
is prepare a few words
to say about your dad.

06:34.417 --> 06:35.417
You mean like a eulogy?

06:35.500 --> 06:36.417
No, I'm not good at that.

06:36.500 --> 06:37.500
Think of it like a toast.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.083
Oh, I'm good at that, yeah.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.500
I can make a toast.
Remember the toast I made

06:40.583 --> 06:41.750
at Ravi's 30th?

06:41.834 --> 06:43.000
That was a roast
and you made him cry.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.959
(laughing): No, because I was
laughing so hard.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.542
Sorry I'm late.

06:47.625 --> 06:48.542
Did you guys make
Jimmy cry yet?

06:48.625 --> 06:49.375
Vanessa!

06:49.458 --> 06:50.667
Everything's
totally normal here,

06:50.750 --> 06:52.208
don't let me keep secrets!

06:52.291 --> 06:53.083
RAVI:
Get off my neck!

06:58.375 --> 06:59.834
Why are you staring
out the window?

06:59.917 --> 07:02.000
Oh crap, is the ice cream
truck coming?

07:02.083 --> 07:03.250
Sara, quick, give me your purse.

07:03.333 --> 07:06.917
No, no, Craig asked me
to move in with him.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Seriously?

07:08.083 --> 07:09.667
Oh, you should do it.

07:09.750 --> 07:12.208
Th-That guy is, like,
soap opera hot.

07:12.291 --> 07:14.083
You leave him alone with me
in a walk-in-closet...

07:14.166 --> 07:15.917
Vanessa!
Sorry.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.458
Point is,
you should lock that down.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.000
Isn't it a little fast?

07:19.083 --> 07:20.000
I don't know.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.291
Ooh, let's try this thing

07:21.375 --> 07:23.041
that I made up to decide stuff.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.125
I used it to decide whether or
not I was gonna have Edie...

07:25.208 --> 07:26.834
(Sara gasps)

07:26.917 --> 07:28.000
...have Edie's birthday

07:28.083 --> 07:29.875
at a park or the pizza place.

07:29.959 --> 07:30.875
Park won.
(chuckles)

07:30.959 --> 07:32.000
(giggles)

07:32.083 --> 07:33.208
Okay, what is it?

07:33.291 --> 07:34.750
It's called
"fors and againsts."

07:34.834 --> 07:36.083
Oh, so, like pros and cons?

07:36.166 --> 07:37.959
Does pros and cons use...

07:38.041 --> 07:39.667
elastics?

07:39.750 --> 07:40.709
Green...

07:40.792 --> 07:42.333
is fors.

07:42.417 --> 07:44.041
Red is against.

07:44.125 --> 07:48.250
Okay, let's see, um,
I love how direct Craig is.

07:48.333 --> 07:49.333
That's a green.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.959
Edie, arm.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.542
But I don't totally feel like

07:53.625 --> 07:55.333
I can be myself around him yet.

07:55.417 --> 07:58.375
Mm... you mean like going
to the bathroom for number two

07:58.458 --> 08:00.125
when you're staying
in a hotel room together.

08:00.208 --> 08:04.041
Why do they always put the
bathroom right off the bedroom?

08:04.125 --> 08:05.667
I do love when he stays over.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.667
Night sex and morning sex.

08:07.750 --> 08:08.834
That's two greens.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.041
But my gut is telling me

08:11.125 --> 08:12.041
it might be too soon.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.458
Now, when people say, "gut,"

08:13.542 --> 08:15.458
it usually means something's
holding them back.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.959
And by<i> something... </i>

08:18.041 --> 08:19.875
I mean<i> someone </i>else.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.083
N-- that's ridiculous.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.458
Not buying it.

08:22.542 --> 08:25.083
And "someone else"
gets the gold hair tie,

08:25.166 --> 08:26.250
and gold beats all.

08:27.166 --> 08:28.667
"Against" wins.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.166
(ice cream truck jingle playing)

08:30.250 --> 08:31.458
Ooh, that is
the ice cream truck!

08:31.542 --> 08:33.166
That's my purse!

08:35.166 --> 08:37.041
Eulogy... eulogy...

08:37.125 --> 08:38.834
How's the eulogy coming, boss?

08:38.917 --> 08:40.166
Hey, if you're looking
for an opening, how about,

08:40.250 --> 08:43.792
"Webster's defines death as..."

08:43.875 --> 08:45.250
As what?

08:45.333 --> 08:46.458
Wait, I'm sorry, do you want
me to write the whole thing?

08:46.542 --> 08:48.000
Look it up, Annelise.
(sighs)

08:48.083 --> 08:49.583
Oh, this is stupid.
My dad died.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.083
We weren't close
and he wasn't very nice to me.

08:51.166 --> 08:52.083
What am I supposed to say?

08:52.166 --> 08:53.083
Definitely not that.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.083
Yeah, that would
be a bad eulogy.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.083
Hey, you know what I need?

08:55.166 --> 08:57.500
Empathy?

08:57.583 --> 08:59.250
My Jimmy-isms you've been
compiling over the years.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.083
Your what?

09:01.166 --> 09:02.917
that I come up with
off the top of my head.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.125
You know,
I'll say something,

09:04.208 --> 09:05.041
and I'll say, "Annelise,
write that down,"

09:05.125 --> 09:06.125
and Annelise writes it down.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.125
Yup, he definitely says that,

09:07.208 --> 09:08.417
and I definitely do that.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.208
I've been saving them
for my memoir,

09:10.291 --> 09:12.291
but I could spare a few pearls
for my dad's eulogy, right?

09:12.375 --> 09:14.834
Right.

09:14.917 --> 09:15.834
No problem, boss.

09:15.917 --> 09:16.834
Just give me a little time

09:16.917 --> 09:18.041
to organize them with the staff.

09:19.291 --> 09:20.583
Everyone,
stop what you're doing.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.500
Jimmy wants me to compile
all his stupid musings

09:23.583 --> 09:25.375
I've been pretending to write
down over the last ten years.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.709
You haven't been
writing them down?

09:26.792 --> 09:28.125
What do you do here?

09:28.208 --> 09:30.125
We need to band
together and remember

09:30.208 --> 09:31.792
all the stupid crap
Jimmy has said over the years.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.583
(gasps) Ooh, I remember one.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.417
"Whoever wins, we lose."

09:35.500 --> 09:38.834
Nope, that's the tagline
to<i> Alien vs. Predator. </i>

09:38.917 --> 09:40.125
Come on.

09:42.792 --> 09:46.083
Dad gave me a list
of Jack's closest friends.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.125
Let's let the
inviting begin.
Okay.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.166
Hi, Ms. Rabinowitz.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.792
I understand you're
a friend of Jack Martino's?

09:53.875 --> 09:55.166
Oh, ex-friend.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.959
He called you what?

09:57.041 --> 09:59.750
Uh, well, maybe he just meant
you're good with money?

09:59.834 --> 10:01.333
Yes, Dr. Lerman, I understand

10:01.417 --> 10:04.166
Jack was a patient of yours
for several years.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.959
Yes, Martino... Hello?

10:07.041 --> 10:08.458
Oh, you're glad he's dead.

10:08.542 --> 10:11.166
Well, why don't you come
celebrate that with us?

10:11.250 --> 10:12.792
I'll pay you.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.667
He owes you how much?

10:14.750 --> 10:16.166
And now I inherit his debit...?

10:16.250 --> 10:17.250
No, no, I don't think
that's how it works.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.250
I got to go, bye.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.750
Forty-one dollars.

10:19.834 --> 10:21.417
Sixty-three dollars!

10:21.500 --> 10:23.000
Sixty-six...!

10:23.083 --> 10:24.542
(groans)
That's our ceiling.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.208
(sighs)

10:30.291 --> 10:32.917
Eulogy, eulogy...

10:33.000 --> 10:34.375
Welcome, everybody.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.000
Sex! Now that I got your
attention, my dad's dead.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.083
Nah.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.375
Jimmy.
Huh?

10:40.458 --> 10:42.625
This came for you
at the restaurant.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.583
Let's see.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.000
Oh!

10:47.083 --> 10:50.083
Contents of my dad's
safe deposit box.

10:54.583 --> 10:56.375
My transistor radio.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.959
Wow, used to sit in the backyard

11:00.041 --> 11:03.208
and listen to the Angels play.

11:03.291 --> 11:05.208
Just a father and son,

11:05.291 --> 11:08.250
enjoying the game.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.041
I can't believe
he kept this.

11:10.125 --> 11:13.250
Jack Martino wasn't
such a bad guy.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.792
Jack Martino was
a real son of a bitch.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.250
God, why did we force
Dad into doing this?

11:18.333 --> 11:19.792
You should've let him
work through his feelings

11:19.875 --> 11:21.792
with-with makeovers and
restaurant overhauls.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.834
We'll tell him
that we were wrong,

11:23.917 --> 11:25.834
that the memorial service
was a stupid idea.

11:25.917 --> 11:26.333
JIMMY: Hey, guys.

11:26.417 --> 11:27.333
GERALD: Yo.

11:27.417 --> 11:28.333
Just came by to tell you

11:28.417 --> 11:30.000
that, uh, you were right.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.166
I mean, just 'cause my dad
was a difficult man,

11:31.250 --> 11:32.250
doesn't mean it won't feel good

11:32.333 --> 11:33.792
to be around
some of his friends, so,

11:33.875 --> 11:36.291
thank you for
twisting my arm and making me

11:36.375 --> 11:37.542
throw this memorial
for my father.

11:37.625 --> 11:38.250
You're welcome.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.125
Hm. I brought smoothies.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.375
Ooh.
Smoothies.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.125
Great turnout, guys.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.291
Oh, luckily, there's
a certain type of person

11:53.375 --> 11:55.041
willing to drive
up to 90 minutes

11:55.125 --> 11:57.291
if you promise them
free wine and cheese.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.875
SARA: Oh, there's Jack's
former cleaning lady.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.000
There's Jack's old
dental hygienist

12:02.083 --> 12:03.291
and her boyfriend Rick.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.375
How come you didn't get

12:04.458 --> 12:05.375
any of his actual friends?

12:05.458 --> 12:07.250
We tried... and failed,

12:07.333 --> 12:09.166
so we called around
Jack's old neighborhood

12:09.250 --> 12:10.875
and scrounged up some randos.

12:10.959 --> 12:12.792
That group is here
because we promised them

12:12.875 --> 12:14.041
free student haircuts.

12:14.125 --> 12:15.583
Why is Ravi staring
at us like that?

12:15.667 --> 12:18.041
Hey, Vanessa. Hi, ring--
I mean Gerald.

12:18.125 --> 12:19.917
There's no ring yet, or ever.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.250
You're being weird!

12:22.959 --> 12:24.667
Hey, did you have a chance
to think about us moving in...

12:24.750 --> 12:26.041
(gasps)
Here comes Jimmy! Okay.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.667
We have to keep
him from having

12:27.750 --> 12:29.000
substantial conversations
with any of the guests.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.250
Luckily, he doesn't really

12:30.333 --> 12:31.959
like to have substantial
conversations.

12:32.041 --> 12:33.542
I mean, I was back
in his life for six months

12:33.625 --> 12:35.208
before he asked me
a personal question,

12:35.291 --> 12:37.333
and it was,
"How big is your package?"

12:37.417 --> 12:39.041
He wanted to know
if he was bigger.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.125
And?
Mom!
Sara!

12:40.208 --> 12:43.166
What? I'm rooting for you.

12:43.250 --> 12:46.375
Here's the game plan:
get Jimmy on that podium ASAP.

12:46.458 --> 12:49.125
He gives his eulogy, I pull the
fire alarm, everybody goes home.

12:49.208 --> 12:50.750
All right.

12:50.834 --> 12:53.166
Everybody seems
dressed casual here.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.750
Well, I guess
that makes sense.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.083
Jack Martino was a no-frills
kind of guy, you know.

12:57.166 --> 12:58.500
And these people

12:58.583 --> 13:00.709
are honoring that with
their cut-off shorts...

13:00.792 --> 13:02.166
and tube tops.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.166
Hi.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.083
So... eulogy time?

13:05.166 --> 13:07.583
These mourners are craving
that sweet, sweet eul.

13:07.667 --> 13:08.417
Let me say hi
to the guests first.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.792
Excuse me.

13:09.875 --> 13:11.083
Hi, I'm Jimmy Martino.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.625
How did you know my father?

13:12.709 --> 13:14.250
<i>Lo siento, no puedo</i>
<i>hablar ingles.</i>

13:14.333 --> 13:16.125
I better get Victor
to translate...

13:16.208 --> 13:19.834
Oh, no, you can't ask a Latino
person to translate Spanish.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.125
It's racist.
Yeah.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.083
Is it racist?

13:22.166 --> 13:23.250
It's not racist.

13:23.333 --> 13:24.959
<i>¿Dónde está el vino?</i>

13:25.041 --> 13:27.041
Oh, uh, so... eulogy?

13:27.125 --> 13:28.000
I haven't written it yet.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.000
Are you kidding?

13:29.083 --> 13:30.000
No, Annelise's
gonna give me

13:30.083 --> 13:31.083
all my Jimmy-isms.
Once I get those,

13:31.166 --> 13:32.667
it'll practically
write itself.
Hmm.

13:32.750 --> 13:35.125
I need those Jimmy-isms
yesterday, people.

13:35.208 --> 13:37.667
It's not that hard, what are
some things he always says?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.041
Okay, how about this:

13:39.125 --> 13:40.208
"No, Ravi, I don't
want to get drinks."

13:40.291 --> 13:41.375
How about this?

13:41.458 --> 13:43.250
"The air is hot with sweat,

13:43.333 --> 13:45.542
anticipation, and the promise
of a future not yet written."

13:45.625 --> 13:47.125
It's way too
beautiful for Jimmy,

13:47.208 --> 13:48.500
but you should be a writer.

13:48.583 --> 13:49.875
I know.

13:49.959 --> 13:50.917
(laughs)

13:51.000 --> 13:52.417
You're not even trying, Cindy.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.750
Sorry, Kylie Jenner just
tweeted something hilarious.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.166
"If there are no two
fingerprints that are alike,

13:58.250 --> 13:59.750
"and no two snowflakes
that are alike,

13:59.834 --> 14:02.917
a snowman would be
the best burglar ever."

14:03.000 --> 14:03.959
Perfect.

14:04.041 --> 14:05.125
Kylie Jenner and Jimmy

14:05.208 --> 14:06.792
have the exact same voice.

14:06.875 --> 14:07.792
Are there more of those?

14:07.875 --> 14:08.917
Oh, tons, KJ tweets

14:09.000 --> 14:09.917
like, every five minutes.

14:10.000 --> 14:10.917
Here's another one:

14:11.000 --> 14:12.250
"There is no "I" in cream,

14:12.333 --> 14:14.166
but there is eye cream."

14:14.250 --> 14:16.792
Ravi, copy 50
of them in an e-mail

14:16.875 --> 14:17.959
and send them to me, stat.

14:18.041 --> 14:18.709
I'm already on it.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.166
Hey, where's my Jimmy-isms?

14:20.250 --> 14:22.250
(computer chimes)

14:22.333 --> 14:24.917
(phone dings)

14:25.000 --> 14:28.250
"When God gives you rain,
make rainbow sorbet."

14:30.166 --> 14:32.250
(laughs)
That's so me.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.250
(sighs)

14:37.500 --> 14:40.166
Hey, you guys,
let's help poor people.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.583
I don't remember saying that.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.792
Hey, so...
you ready to get up there?

14:43.875 --> 14:45.709
Oh, I don't know,
I thought these Jimmy-isms

14:45.792 --> 14:47.250
would help me crack
the eulogy, but...

14:47.333 --> 14:50.208
I-I know I said
more profound things.

14:50.291 --> 14:53.083
I-I don't ever remember being
this obsessed with side boob.

14:54.166 --> 14:57.208
I don't know what I'm doing.

14:57.291 --> 14:59.792
Oh, God, all right,
come on, relax.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.917
You can do this.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.291
Just be honest.

15:03.375 --> 15:04.875
Let yourself be vulnerable.

15:06.291 --> 15:08.667
Uh, do you remember back
when we were dating...

15:08.750 --> 15:10.458
we went on that ski trip
to Tahoe?

15:10.542 --> 15:11.834
Yeah...

15:11.917 --> 15:13.500
one more slope
and you were worried

15:13.583 --> 15:14.625
that your lips were
getting chapped...

15:14.709 --> 15:16.125
Right, I went back to the lodge,

15:16.208 --> 15:17.500
and-and it started
to snow like crazy.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.875
Yes, a-and by the time
I got back,

15:19.959 --> 15:22.917
you were so worried about me,
and I walked in,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.250
and you looked at me
and you said,

15:24.333 --> 15:26.959
"I was so worried about you."

15:27.959 --> 15:28.917
That's a terrible story.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.041
What's the point?

15:30.125 --> 15:32.250
(scoffs)
That is the point.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.625
It wasn't cool or interesting.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.083
It was real and vulnerable.

15:37.166 --> 15:40.750
That's always been my
favorite version of you.

15:40.834 --> 15:42.166
Be that guy.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.750
Did we have sex later
that night?

15:43.834 --> 15:45.959
(scoffs)
We had sex most nights.

15:46.041 --> 15:47.333
Why didn't you put
that in the story?

15:47.417 --> 15:49.250
That would have made it,
you know, something.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.250
Hey, guys.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.208
Hey.
Hey, Sara.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.250
Hi.
How you holding up?

15:53.333 --> 15:54.834
Not good.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.000
What can I do?

15:57.083 --> 15:58.333
Can you write a
speech about my dad?

15:58.417 --> 16:01.333
'Cause all this stuff
isn't working....

16:01.417 --> 16:03.000
What are you saying?

16:03.083 --> 16:05.083
I don't know,
you could still put that...

16:08.375 --> 16:09.834
Hey.

16:09.917 --> 16:12.250
Sara, I consider
myself pretty secure.

16:12.333 --> 16:14.333
I asked you to move in
over 36 hours ago,

16:14.417 --> 16:16.291
and you haven't given me
an answer yet because

16:16.375 --> 16:18.208
you're so busy helping your
baby daddy, and I get that,

16:18.291 --> 16:19.542
Yes.
but...

16:20.542 --> 16:21.458
Yes, what?

16:21.542 --> 16:23.291
Yes, let's move in together.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.417
Okay.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.792
(chuckles)
Yeah.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.291
Code red!
He's mingling.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.333
Where, what?

16:29.417 --> 16:30.333
You should go.

16:30.417 --> 16:31.333
Wait, so how do you

16:31.417 --> 16:32.834
know Jack Martino?

16:32.917 --> 16:34.000
My girlfriend was
his dental hygienist.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.417
Said he was a real jackass,

16:35.500 --> 16:36.792
never opened wide.

16:36.875 --> 16:38.291
Damn it, Rick!

16:38.375 --> 16:39.333
Who are these people?

16:39.417 --> 16:40.625
Where are the people
I gave you on that list?

16:40.709 --> 16:41.875
They really
wanted to come...

16:41.959 --> 16:43.333
It was just really
short notice...

16:43.417 --> 16:45.208
It's always short notice
when someone dies.

16:46.250 --> 16:49.375
Oh...

16:49.458 --> 16:52.709
Anybody who really knew him
didn't want to come, right?

16:52.792 --> 16:55.083
I don't know why
that surprises me.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.875
I'm Jack Martino's son
and I don't want to be here.

16:56.959 --> 16:58.583
Why would they?

16:58.667 --> 17:01.000
By the way, thanks for
forcing me to do this.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.291
Now when I think of my dad,

17:02.375 --> 17:03.333
I can add this sham memorial

17:03.417 --> 17:04.458
to the list of crappy memories.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.291
Dad...
Jimmy...
You know what?

17:06.375 --> 17:07.291
Just do me a favor, okay?

17:07.375 --> 17:08.333
Stay out of my business.

17:08.417 --> 17:09.709
Oh, hey, my girl told me

17:09.792 --> 17:11.375
another thing
that sucked about Jack.

17:11.458 --> 17:15.291
He used to grab six toothbrushes
on his way out, every time.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.166
God! How'd you know him?

17:20.750 --> 17:21.750
(sighs heavily)

17:24.417 --> 17:25.792
Can you believe
Sara and Gerald?

17:25.875 --> 17:27.333
Forcing me to throw
this memorial,

17:27.417 --> 17:28.333
filling it with
a bunch of people

17:28.417 --> 17:29.375
my father didn't even know.

17:29.458 --> 17:30.667
Yeah, the nerve.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.667
What's that supposed to mean?

17:31.750 --> 17:33.166
Nothing, I'm agreeing with you.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.417
Yeah, but you're agreeing
in a voice that sounds

17:34.500 --> 17:35.834
like you don't agree with me.

17:35.917 --> 17:36.834
I don't like that voice.

17:36.917 --> 17:38.250
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.667
It's rough out there.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.333
One of the guests is wearing
a shirt that says,

17:41.417 --> 17:43.375
<i>"Gremlins 2 </i>Now Available
on VHS."

17:43.458 --> 17:45.166
Yeah.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.208
got your dad's old address
from me yesterday,

17:47.291 --> 17:49.542
so that they could spend
all day cold-calling

17:49.625 --> 17:51.000
every business in his town,

17:51.083 --> 17:53.583
asking if any of the
employees knew your dad

17:53.667 --> 17:55.625
to fill this place up
so that you could

17:55.709 --> 17:57.333
give him a proper good-bye.

17:57.417 --> 17:59.417
So, yeah, the nerve.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.375
This is crazy, bro.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.333
I can't keep babysitting you
until I propose.

18:12.417 --> 18:13.333
Listen...

18:13.417 --> 18:14.417
if you don't blow my secret,

18:14.500 --> 18:15.583
I will make you one
of my groomsmen.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.000
Best man.
No!

18:17.083 --> 18:18.000
Okay, well, then I just can't...

18:18.083 --> 18:19.041
No, okay...

18:19.125 --> 18:20.417
secret best man.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.583
I'm listening.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.417
Yeah, I will have a best man

18:23.500 --> 18:25.041
that isn't you, but secretly,

18:25.125 --> 18:27.875
between you and me,
you're my best man.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.917
But you know I'm bad
at keeping secrets.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.375
Well, then I guess
I'll just have to find

18:31.458 --> 18:32.583
another secret best man...

18:32.667 --> 18:33.583
I'll keep it!

18:33.667 --> 18:35.375
I'll keep it so good.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.291
Oh, God, thank God.

18:37.375 --> 18:40.208
All right? All right.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.375
Crap, now I have to plan
a bachelor party.

18:42.458 --> 18:44.458
I don't have time for this.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.417
Hi, I'd like to, uh,

19:00.500 --> 19:03.500
say a few words about my father
Jack Martino.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.583
There's an expression I say,

19:07.667 --> 19:11.417
uh, um, "Every day is a gift,

19:11.500 --> 19:13.917
but life doesn't have
a return policy."

19:24.834 --> 19:27.458
My dad and I loved
to listen to the radio...

19:27.542 --> 19:29.083
and sit in the backyard,

19:29.166 --> 19:32.750
and we would listen to
the Angels game together...

19:35.041 --> 19:37.041
...but I<i> pretended </i>to love it

19:37.125 --> 19:41.625
because it was the classic
father-son thing to do.

19:41.709 --> 19:44.375
Truth is, I didn't know
anything about baseball.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.208
I didn't know what the hell

19:46.291 --> 19:48.375
the announcers were talking
about, but...

19:50.500 --> 19:53.417
...it was the only thing
I could do with my father

19:53.500 --> 19:55.542
where we didn't have
to talk to each other.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.166
My dad wasn't a great guy.

20:04.250 --> 20:06.208
He was selfish,
and he was rude...

20:06.291 --> 20:09.917
that's why you're all here
instead of his real friends...

20:11.375 --> 20:13.166
...but he was my dad...

20:15.750 --> 20:18.583
...and I wish he were still
alive today because...

20:20.583 --> 20:22.208
...he never
got to meet my family.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.500
Jack Martino didn't like much,

20:25.583 --> 20:27.875
but he would have liked
my family.

20:27.959 --> 20:29.500
He would have said,

20:29.583 --> 20:31.125
"They're too good for you."

20:33.458 --> 20:34.625
And he would have been right.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.458
That's the one thing I regret.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.583
My father never had
the chance to meet my...

20:44.583 --> 20:45.583
Thank you.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.458
Boy, that was embarrassing.
