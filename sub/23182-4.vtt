You're packing up
for a fishin' trip

00:12.200 --> 00:13.933
with your pals the other day.

00:16.100 --> 00:17.500
I loves fishin' in Kwee‐bec.

00:17.533 --> 00:19.300
Who doesn't love fishing
in Kay‐bec?

00:19.333 --> 00:20.966

‐I fucking hate Quebec.
‐This guy's fuckin' Puppers.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.033
‐Oh, I'm havin' flash snacks.
‐To what?

00:25.066 --> 00:26.500
To last time we went fishing.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.100
On the ride home,
I had to sit in between

00:28.133 --> 00:29.766
a family size
of Salt'n Vinnies

00:29.800 --> 00:31.433
and a party pack
of Dill Picklers.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.733
Admittedly, last time, things
got a little out of whack,

00:33.766 --> 00:35.200
when it comes to the snacks.

00:35.233 --> 00:36.900
We deserve the flak,
but now we're back on track.

00:36.933 --> 00:38.200
We have a new plan of attack.

00:38.233 --> 00:40.133
Everything we pack
has to fit in this sack.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.833
We made a snack pact.

00:41.866 --> 00:43.033
All these have to start
with the letter "C," in fact.

00:43.066 --> 00:45.466
A, stop rhyming. B, why "C"?

00:45.500 --> 00:47.100
‐Well, we trieds "A."
‐Apples.

00:47.133 --> 00:48.866
‐And we trieds "B."
‐Bananas.

00:48.900 --> 00:50.366
But "C" gave us
many choice options.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.333
Cookies. Crackers.
Cheese. Chocolates.

00:52.366 --> 00:54.433
See? And then we're on to "D,"
and so forth.

00:54.466 --> 00:56.266
‐KATY: Mmm. Love the D.
‐Pardon?

00:56.300 --> 00:58.300
‐Why does jerky get to come?
‐It's Caribou jerky.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.900
‐What about the nuts?
‐Corn nuts.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.200
‐And the beer?
‐BOTH: Cold beer.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.100
There's too much
choice in the world.

01:04.133 --> 01:06.000
‐How do you fig, Newton?
‐Well, look at toothpaste.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.366
It used to be
just Colgate or Crest.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.766

went to the rippers.

19:44.366 --> 19:45.966
What do you do with mushrooms?

19:46.000 --> 19:48.800
Are we talking Portobello?
Shiitake? Chanterelles?

19:48.833 --> 19:50.400
I can cook, you know.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.366
You give them shit
and keep them in the dark.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.033
Roald. Are you afflicted?

20:02.966 --> 20:04.000
What are you...

20:04.466 --> 20:05.700
Ow!

20:07.266 --> 20:08.266
Roald?

20:11.500 --> 20:14.166
Give me three reasons
why you feel you must rebel.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.966
BOTH: I hate the world.
I hate my parents.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.766
I hate myself!

20:17.800 --> 20:18.933
As you were.

20:18.966 --> 20:20.333
ALL: FAK‐U!

20:24.266 --> 20:25.833
What a bust.

20:25.866 --> 20:28.066
Pretty pedestrian effort,
super chieftains.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.300
Only fish we caught
was the one

20:29.333 --> 20:31.233
Cock Cousteau
tossed over at us.

20:31.266 --> 20:32.866
I fuckin' hate Quebec.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.366
Can't catch a break here.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.066
(SNOWMOBILES APPROACHING)

20:49.866 --> 20:50.900
Oh, bother.

20:52.066 --> 20:53.333
Degens from up‐country.

21:00.933 --> 21:02.866
No ostrich fuckers
in Quebec, hicks.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.500
Well, we are way the fucks
outnumbered, bud.

21:10.533 --> 21:13.933
It's not how many you win,
it's how many you show up for.

21:13.966 --> 21:15.833
‐Is that a No Fear slogan?
‐Likely.

21:18.366 --> 21:19.933

24:00.000 --> 24:01.033

24:01.066 --> 24:02.300
Well, it's best
to avoid a scrap

24:02.333 --> 24:04.200
when you're goin' fishin'.

24:04.233 --> 24:06.700
But you hate degens

24:07.866 --> 24:09.766
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

24:11.333 --> 24:12.833

24:14.933 --> 24:16.166
Laval.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.200
My whole life,
I've hated the French.

24:18.233 --> 24:19.266
You can't understand
what they're saying

24:19.300 --> 24:20.933
half the fuckin' time.

24:20.966 --> 24:22.100
And I couldn't land
one of your beautiful women

24:22.133 --> 24:23.233
if my life depended on it.

24:24.166 --> 24:25.466
As far as I'm concerned,

24:25.500 --> 24:26.966
youse can take a walk,
the lot of youse.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.300

24:35.933 --> 24:37.766
Who doesn't love fishing
in Kay‐bec?

24:37.800 --> 24:39.066
Great fishin' in Kyu‐bec.

24:53.366 --> 24:54.933
I think you're really
good‐looking.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.033
Um, I was looking at you

24:58.066 --> 25:00.133
