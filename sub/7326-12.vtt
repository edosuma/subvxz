WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.574
(crowd murmuring,
camera shutters clicking)

00:03.574 --> 00:06.077
(Meredith) FAILURE IS
AN INEVITABILITY.

00:06.077 --> 00:07.208
(Owen) DR. CRISTINA YANG.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.180
(applause)
(amplified voice)
THANK YOU, DR. HUNT.

00:09.180 --> 00:13.384
(clears throat) THE, UH...
(shutters continue clicking)

00:13.384 --> 00:18.018
THE PROCEDURE I--
IS SO RELATIVELY UNTRIED

00:18.018 --> 00:23.724
THAT THE ASSOCIATED RISKS
ARE UN-UNUSUALLY HIGH.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.127
STILL, THAT SHOULDN'T
BE A REASON

00:26.127 --> 00:28.028
NOT TO TRY.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.301
EVERY SCIENTIST WAS TOLD "NO,"

00:30.301 --> 00:33.664
OVER AND OVER.

00:33.664 --> 00:36.036
(murmuring continues)

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
YOU OKAY?
YEAH.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.642
FORTUNATELY, THE PATIENT
IS RESPONDING VERY WELL FOR NOW.

00:41.642 --> 00:45.776
HIS VITALS REMAIN STABLE,
AND IT IS OUR HOPE

00:45.776 --> 00:48.179
THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE.
AND IF IT DOES,

00:48.179 --> 00:51.352
I AM CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC

00:51.352 --> 00:54.485
THAT WE CAN CALL THIS PROCEDURE
A SUCCESS--

00:54.485 --> 00:55.656
UH...
(feedback whines)

00:55.656 --> 00:57.758
"HOME RUN" IS
A BETTER WORD. (chuckles)

00:57.758 --> 01:00.391
DR. YANG HIT A HOME RUN.

01:00.391 --> 01:04.064
THANKS TO HER, BABY NATHAN
IS THRIVING THIS MORNING.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.236
(applause)

01:05.236 --> 01:07.568
THE ONES WE REMEMBER.

01:09.740 --> 01:13.274
THE ONES WHO CHANGED OUR LIVES.

01:14.705 --> 01:17.348
THE CURIES, THE SALKS...

01:17.348 --> 01:19.180
(zips)
THE BARNARDS...

01:19.180 --> 01:20.251
WE'LL PRINT ANOTHER
PORTAL VEIN.

01:20.251 --> 01:22.153
WE'LL PERFORM TESTS
ON THAT,

01:22.153 --> 01:24.215
AND LOOK FOR MATERIAL
THAT WILL HOLD UP BETTER.

01:24.215 --> 01:26.317
SO WE GO BACK
TO THE DRAWING BOARD?

01:26.317 --> 01:29.390
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO WOULDN'T
TAKE "NO" FOR AN ANSWER.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.721
YES, MA'AM.

01:30.721 --> 01:33.464
(indistinct conversations)
(Richard sighs)

01:33.464 --> 01:35.166
MORNING.

01:35.166 --> 01:38.098
IS THAT YOUR NAME I SEE ON
THE O.R. BOARD THIS AFTERNOON?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.700
WELL, IT'S JUST A CHOLIE.
GETTING MY FEET WET.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.101
YOU'RE GONNA MISS
KEPNER'S WEDDING?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.173
WELL, I SCHEDULED
MY FIRST SURGERY

01:42.173 --> 01:43.634
WHEN EVERYONE WILL BE GONE.

01:43.634 --> 01:45.206
I-I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG FUSS.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.837
YOU GOT A TUMOR DEBULKING.

01:46.837 --> 01:49.380
YOU GONNA BE DONE IN TIME?
I WILL BE DONE ON TIME.

01:49.380 --> 01:50.841
ALL RIGHT.

01:50.841 --> 01:53.284
(woman on P.A.
speaks indistinctly) 3-4-9-1.

01:53.284 --> 01:55.316
(speaks indistinctly) 3-4-9-1.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.417
YOU'RE OPERATING, TOO, HUH?

01:56.417 --> 01:59.350
THE MEDICATION'S HELPING?
(scoffs) MM.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.591
I'M PROUD OF YOU, BAILEY.

02:00.591 --> 02:03.494
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A BIG FUSS.

02:03.494 --> 02:04.655
(elevator bell dings)

02:04.655 --> 02:06.627
(telephone rings)

02:06.627 --> 02:07.698
I THOUGHT THAT WENT
PRETTY WELL.

02:07.698 --> 02:08.859
YOU'RE OFF MY SERVICE.

02:08.859 --> 02:10.401
AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE
OVER YOUR HOURS.

02:10.401 --> 02:12.233
YOU SHOULD GO HOME
AND TAKE A DAY OFF.
WHAT?!

02:12.233 --> 02:14.235
WHAT FOR?
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN
TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.836
THEY NEEDED TO HEAR
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY--

02:15.836 --> 02:17.708
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH YOU SPEAKING FOR ME,

02:17.708 --> 02:19.270
ESPECIALLY ABOUT THIS CASE.

02:19.270 --> 02:20.911
ROSS ACTUALLY SAID
WHAT NEEDED TO BE SAID.
(tapping tablet)

02:20.911 --> 02:22.713
AND YOU WERE NOT
COMFORTABLE AT ALL.

02:22.713 --> 02:24.875
YOU WERE TANKING IN THERE.
I'M ONLY AT 68 HOURS
FOR THE WEEK. SEE?

02:24.875 --> 02:27.578
"J.A.M.A." WANTS A INTERVIEW.
IT SHOULD BE SHORT.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.180
CONFERENCE ROOM "C".

02:29.180 --> 02:31.722
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

02:31.722 --> 02:33.424
YOU'VE BEEN GOING
TOO FAST LATELY.

02:33.424 --> 02:35.386
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO NOTICED.
WHO?

02:35.386 --> 02:36.887
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO.
HAVE I SCREWED UP?

02:36.887 --> 02:38.229
IS MY WORK NOT UP TO--
NO.

02:38.229 --> 02:39.790
YOUR WORK IS--IS GREAT.

02:39.790 --> 02:42.833
IT'S JUST, YOU'RE BECOMING...

02:42.833 --> 02:43.934
YOU'RE GOING TO BURN
YOURSELF OUT.

02:43.934 --> 02:46.337
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.938
YOU JUST NEED TO WORK
OFF SOME TENSION.

02:47.938 --> 02:49.900
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT
ANYMORE.

02:49.900 --> 02:51.802
IF YOU'RE WORRIED I THINK
IT'S MORE THAN IT IS, I DON'T.

02:51.802 --> 02:54.275
IT'S JUST TO RELAX YOU.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.607
IT'S YOU WHO NEEDS
TO RELAX.

02:56.607 --> 02:57.808
I'M FINE.

02:57.808 --> 02:59.910
I'M SORRY.

02:59.910 --> 03:01.682
DON'T SHUT ME OUT.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.514
I'M FINE.

03:03.514 --> 03:07.418
ROSS, GO HOME.

03:10.221 --> 03:11.662
OKAY, SO FIRST WE DETERMINE

03:11.662 --> 03:12.863
THE RECEPTIVE FIELD
OF ALL THE SENSORS, RIGHT?

03:12.863 --> 03:13.824
YEAH.
OKAY.

03:13.824 --> 03:14.925
(Owen) DEREK, THE GUYS
FROM KLEISS NEUROSCIENCE

03:14.925 --> 03:16.697
WILL BE HERE IN 20.
OH, I CAN'T. I--

03:16.697 --> 03:18.529
ONCE I'M DONE HERE, I HAVE
TO GET BAILEY TO A MUSIC CLASS.

03:18.529 --> 03:19.800
(Callie)
UM, WHAT'S THIS?

03:19.800 --> 03:20.871
THEY WANT TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT A RESEARCH THING.

03:20.871 --> 03:22.473
IT'S NOT JUST A "THING."

03:22.473 --> 03:24.905
IT IS THE PRESIDENTIAL
INITIATIVE ON BRAIN MAPPING.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.808
IT IS THE THING.
OKAY. NO. (chuckles)

03:27.808 --> 03:28.839
WE'RE STARTING PHASE TWO.

03:28.839 --> 03:30.311
OKAY? HE'S MY BRAIN NOW.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.782
MEREDITH CAN HAVE THE REST.
I GET HIS BRAIN.

03:31.782 --> 03:33.384
I'LL GET RID OF THEM.
NO, YOU WON'T.

03:33.384 --> 03:34.815
YOU WILL SAY "YES"
TO THEM.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.547
AND YOU'RE BOTH GONNA
BE AT KEPNER'S WEDDING, YES?

03:36.547 --> 03:37.718
MM-HMM.
UH-HUH.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.919
(doors swing open)
I'M NOT GOING.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.291
BAILEY'S DOING SURGERY,
FINALLY.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.352
AND I'D RATHER DO THAT
THAN WATCH ARIZONA

03:41.352 --> 03:42.723
STAND UP THERE LOOKING
GORGEOUS

03:42.723 --> 03:44.895
WHILE I'M SOME PATHETIC,
SHRIVELED, LEFTOVER,

03:44.895 --> 03:46.497
DISCARDED THING SHE SCRAPED
OFF HER SHOE.

03:46.497 --> 03:47.698
EW!
NO, DON'T DO THAT.

03:47.698 --> 03:49.760
NO! I KNOW YOU THINK
THIS IS JUST WHAT I DO.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.462
OH, HEY, HEY! YOU'RE ALL GOING
TO THE WEDDING, RIGHT?

03:51.462 --> 03:52.463
(Jo and Steph) YES.
IS IT MANDATORY?

03:53.534 --> 03:55.566
THIS IS EXACTLY--
EXACTLY WHAT YOU DO.

03:55.566 --> 03:57.308
I KNOW WHAT I DO,
AND THIS IS NOT THAT.

03:57.308 --> 03:58.639
(telephone rings)

03:58.639 --> 03:59.870
SHE WAS IMPORTANT.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.772
(voice breaks)
WE WERE SOMETHING.

04:01.772 --> 04:05.346
MAYBE THEY WAS SOMETHING.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.917
NAH.
NO.

04:06.917 --> 04:08.749
HOW'S YOUR DAD?

04:08.749 --> 04:09.920
HE'S TOLD ALL THE NURSES
YOU'RE HIS KID.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.982
HE'S PROUD.
HOW IS HE?

04:11.982 --> 04:14.385
DON'T KNOW.
DON'T REALLY CARE.
(horn honks,
tires screech in distance)

04:14.385 --> 04:16.927
(man) HELP! YOU GOTTA HELP
MY BOY! HE'S BEEN RUN OVER!

04:16.927 --> 04:19.660
(grunts)
SIR, DO NOT MOVE!
DON'T MOVE HIM!

04:19.660 --> 04:20.791
(Arizona) NO, NO, NO, NO.
STOP! STOP! THE GURNEY!

04:20.791 --> 04:21.962
KEEP HIM STILL.
BACKBOARD AND C-SPINE!

04:21.962 --> 04:23.334
(voice breaking)
HE WAS DRIVING THE TRACTOR.

04:23.334 --> 04:24.965
HE HIT A BUMP
AND FELL OFF.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.797
HE WENT UNDER THE WHEEL
AND THE CHASER BIN, TOO.

04:26.797 --> 04:27.938
HAS HE MOVED AT ALL SINCE?

04:27.938 --> 04:29.640
YEAH, YEAH, HE WAS
TRYING TO GET UP.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.302
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM
STRAIGHT TO THE LODOX.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO!

04:31.302 --> 04:33.744
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
CODY. HIS NAME'S CODY.

04:33.744 --> 04:35.906
CODY, I'M DR. ROBBINS.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

04:35.906 --> 04:36.847
YOU DIDN'T CALL
AN AMBULANCE?

04:36.847 --> 04:38.709
I CALLED 9-1-1.
BUT THEN HE PASSED OUT,

04:38.709 --> 04:39.980
AND I WAS SO SCARED,
I COULDN'T WAIT.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
SO I-I BROUGHT HIM HERE
MYSELF.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.885
YOU SAY HE WAS MOVING
BEFORE?

04:44.885 --> 04:46.417
YEAH. THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

04:46.417 --> 04:47.918
SIR, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO STEP BACK.

04:47.918 --> 04:49.760
WE'RE GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN.

04:52.623 --> 04:53.894
UH, EXCUSE ME, GREY?

04:53.894 --> 04:56.567
UH, THE PRESS WOULD LIKE
SOME PHOTOS OF THE PRINTER.

04:56.567 --> 04:58.599
IS THIS A GOOD TIME?
OH, SURE.
WHERE DO YOU WANT US?

04:58.599 --> 04:59.970
OH, WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY--

04:59.970 --> 05:01.502
IT'S FOR
THE NATHAN GLAZIER CASE. SO..

05:01.502 --> 05:02.933
BUT IT'S PRINTING MY WORK.
(printer whirring)

05:02.933 --> 05:05.976
YEAH, THAT'S FINE.
I MEAN, NO ONE WOULD KNOW.

05:05.976 --> 05:07.538
WE CAN COME BACK.

05:07.538 --> 05:10.010
(whirring continues)

05:10.010 --> 05:11.942
OKAY, RIGHT BY THE PRINTER.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.450
(woman) OH, DR. YANG,
THAT'S PERFECT.

05:19.450 --> 05:20.851
(camera shutter clicking)

05:20.851 --> 05:22.493
(whirring continues)

05:35.736 --> 05:36.807
(device beeps,
heartbeat whooshing)
IT'S A BURST FRACTURE
AT C-6

05:36.807 --> 05:38.609
PAGE TORRES.
HIS BELLY'S FULL OF BLOOD.

05:38.609 --> 05:39.610
HE'S GOING TO THE O.R. NOW.
HE SHOULD'VE WAITED
FOR THE AMBULANCE.

05:39.610 --> 05:41.442
I THINK THIS GUY PARALYZED
HIS OWN KID

05:41.442 --> 05:43.013
BY BRINGING HIM HERE
HIMSELF.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET,
ALEX.

05:43.013 --> 05:44.975
I GOT THIS. WHY DON'T
YOU GO BE WITH YOUR DAD?
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:44.975 --> 05:46.747
WHAT?
YOU MUST HAVE QUESTIONS.
(clattering)

05:46.747 --> 05:48.619
LONG-LOST FATHER? I MEAN,
I'D HAVE A BILLION.

05:48.619 --> 05:49.950
HELP ME GET HIM TO
THE O.R.,

05:49.950 --> 05:52.683
AND THEN I'LL CALL YOU
IF I NEED YOU, OKAY? LET'S GO.

05:52.683 --> 05:54.725
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

05:54.725 --> 05:56.527
HE HAS A LOT
OF INTERNAL BLEEDING,

05:56.527 --> 05:57.688
SO WE NEED TO OPERATE
RIGHT AWAY.

05:57.688 --> 05:59.590
ALSO, HIS NECK IS BROKEN.
OH, MY GOD.

05:59.590 --> 06:00.931
HE CAN MOVE, RIGHT?

06:00.931 --> 06:02.693
HE WAS MOVING.

06:02.693 --> 06:03.664
THAT WAS BEFORE
HE WAS MOV--
WE'LL KNOW MORE
IN A BIT.

06:03.664 --> 06:04.895
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN.

06:04.895 --> 06:05.936
SO SIT TIGHT.

06:07.498 --> 06:10.841
(bell dings)
(sighs)

06:11.872 --> 06:13.904
OHH!
UHH!

06:13.904 --> 06:15.646
WOW, YOU LOOK...
NOPE! NO.

06:15.646 --> 06:17.007
DON'T SAY I LOOK NICE.
LIKE A TRAIN WRECK.

06:17.007 --> 06:18.078
BUT I CAN SEE
WHERE IT'S GOING.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.610
UM, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

06:19.610 --> 06:21.051
I'M HUNTING BRIDESMAIDS.

06:21.051 --> 06:24.014
NOW IS THAT
A FARM TRADITION?
ARE YOU GONNA BE THERE?

06:24.014 --> 06:25.556
(telephone rings in distance)

06:25.556 --> 06:27.688
ALL RIGHT. I TOTALLY
UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE NOT.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.819
I JUST--
DO YOU WANT ME
TO BE THERE?

06:28.819 --> 06:31.121
YES! OF COURSE.
THEN I'LL BE THERE.

06:31.121 --> 06:33.424
(pats legs)
THANK YOU.

06:33.424 --> 06:34.725
(sighs)
ALL RIGHT.

06:34.725 --> 06:35.726
OKAY. OH, WAIT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
OH, WATCH IT.

06:35.726 --> 06:36.897
THE HAIR IS...
YEAH.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.470
ELLIOT HOOKS, 20, HERE FOR
REPEAT DEBULKING

06:39.470 --> 06:41.772
OF BRONCHIAL TUMORS.
THIS WILL BE HIS...

06:41.772 --> 06:44.435
WAIT, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
IT'S RIGHT.

06:44.435 --> 06:45.906
312 SURGERIES.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.978
I STARTED TREATMENTS
WHEN I WAS 4.

06:47.978 --> 06:49.980
HIS GROWTHS RECUR,
BUILD UP AND THREATEN

06:49.980 --> 06:51.612
HIS LARYNX AND LUNGS.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.714
WE HAVE TO LASER THEM OUT.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.916
EVERY SEVEN TO TEN DAYS.
312?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.148
THAT'S... ROUGH.
I'M USED TO IT.

06:58.148 --> 07:00.050
MY FOLKS BOUGHT A HOUSE
A FEW BLOCKS AWAY.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.622
KINDA THE WAY YOU MOVE
CLOSE TO THE GOOD SCHOOL.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.854
(sighs) NO, WE'RE NOT
DOING THIS.

07:03.854 --> 07:05.095
SORRY.
ELLIOT...

07:05.095 --> 07:08.699
WHAT IF I CAN CULTURE
YOUR TUMOR CELLS IN A LAB

07:08.699 --> 07:12.032
AND CUSTOM DESIGN A DRUG
THAT CAN STOP THE GROWTH,

07:12.032 --> 07:14.004
FIND EXACTLY THE MEDICINE
TO STOP THEM?

07:14.004 --> 07:16.567
AND... NO SURGERY?

07:16.567 --> 07:17.738
NO SURGERIES, EVER AGAIN.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.709
OH, MY GOD.

07:18.709 --> 07:19.840
RIGHT?
OH, MY GOD.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.642
(telephone rings in distance)

07:22.713 --> 07:25.015
YOU DON'T THINK THIS YOUNG MAN'S
HAD ENOUGH SURGERY?

07:25.015 --> 07:26.577
YES, MA'AM.
I'M SORRY.

07:26.577 --> 07:28.549
DAMN RIGHT, YOU'RE SORRY.
NOW LET'S GO OPEN UP MY LAB.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.680
NO!

07:30.721 --> 07:32.783
I HAVEN'T HAD
ENOUGH SURGERY.

07:32.783 --> 07:35.626
I HAVE WAITED AND WAITED
FOR YOU TO GET BACK IN THE O.R.,

07:35.626 --> 07:37.628
AND DAMN IT,
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

07:37.628 --> 07:40.691
I'M HERE TO STUDY SURGERY,
AND I'M BEING LEFT BEHIND.

07:40.691 --> 07:42.032
AND I DESERVE
BETTER THAN THIS.

07:42.032 --> 07:43.133
SO I...

07:44.635 --> 07:45.636
(telephone rings)

07:47.998 --> 07:50.140
I'M JUST TIRED.

07:50.140 --> 07:53.644
LET'S GO.
WE NEED TO DO ELLIOT'S
PROCEDURE ONCE MORE,

07:53.644 --> 07:55.205
TO GET THE SAMPLES
I NEED.

07:55.205 --> 07:57.948
AND YOU WILL PERFORM IT,
BEGINNING TO END.

07:57.948 --> 08:01.251
PREP THE MAN.
THANK YOU.

08:01.251 --> 08:02.783
(woman)
EH, WATCH YOURSELF IN THERE.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.785
HIS BREATH
IN INCREDIBLY NASTY.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.256
(sniffs) IT'S FINE.
IT'S NOT.

08:06.256 --> 08:07.788
IT'S--IT'S RANK.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.160
I CAN SMELL WHAT HE ATE
LAST TUESDAY.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.663
(types)
THAT IS ZENKER'S
DIVERTICULUM.

08:12.663 --> 08:14.765
NOW THESE MUSCLES HERE
SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER

08:14.765 --> 08:16.797
TO PUSH FOOD DOWN
THE ESOPHAGUS.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.570
(clears throat)
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, DALTON'S
ARE WORKING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

08:19.570 --> 08:21.802
SO THE WALL FORMS A SACK,

08:21.802 --> 08:23.233
AND THAT'S WHERE THE FOOD'S
GETTING CAUGHT.
(Dalton clears throat)

08:23.233 --> 08:25.005
I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I HAVE
SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MY THROAT.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.808
HE GOT PNEUMONIA ONCE
FROM GETTING FOOD IN HIS LUNGS.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.179
HE'S A MESS.
I'M A MESS.

08:29.179 --> 08:30.941
WELL, I'LL BE CUTTING
INTO THE LOWER MUSCLE,

08:30.941 --> 08:32.783
SO THAT'LL ALLOW THE FOOD
TO PASS RIGHT THROUGH.
(clears throat)

08:32.783 --> 08:34.815
AND THE WALLS WILL
TIGHTEN UP ON THEIR OWN.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.946
ANYTHING WE SHOULD
WORRY ABOUT?

08:35.946 --> 08:37.217
WELL, OF COURSE,
WITH ALL SURGERIES...

08:37.217 --> 08:38.789
(clears throat)
THERE ARE CERTAIN RISKS--

08:38.789 --> 08:40.290
WORST CASE BEING STROKE
OR EVEN DEATH.
(clears throat)

08:40.290 --> 08:42.092
BUT THESE ARE ALL
VERY MINIMAL IN THIS CASE.

08:42.092 --> 08:43.594
THERE IS A SMALL RISK
OF DAMAGE...
(clears throat)

08:43.594 --> 08:45.155
TO THE VOCAL CHORD NERVES,
THOUGH.
WHAT, LIKE...

08:45.155 --> 08:46.797
I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK?

08:46.797 --> 08:48.759
THAT'S THE WORST CASE.
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.763
YOU HAVE A CUTE BUTT.
DALTON!

08:52.763 --> 08:54.665
YOU HEARD THE MAN.
I MIGHT NOT SPEAK AGAIN.

08:54.665 --> 08:56.166
AND I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
ANYTHING UNSAID.

08:56.166 --> 08:59.069
(sighs)
YOU HAVE A SWEET
CABOOSE.

08:59.069 --> 09:00.540
(chuckles)
ALSO, I NEVER LIKED
YOUR BROTHER.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.612
WHAT?!
(slaps arm)

09:01.612 --> 09:03.013
I ALSO COULD HAVE
KEPT THAT ONE TO MYSELF.

09:03.013 --> 09:04.745
BUT IT FELT GOOD
TO SAY IT.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.647
YOU'RE AN IDIOT. HOW SOON
CAN YOU PUT HIM UNDER?

09:07.748 --> 09:09.820
(camera shutter clicking)
UGH!

09:09.820 --> 09:11.922
YEAH, THERE YOU ARE.

09:11.922 --> 09:13.684
YEAH, SHE IS THE MAGICAL HEALER
OF CHILDREN.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.555
BUT YOU'RE DONE NOW, RIGHT?
YOU'RE DONE? CAN WE GO?

09:15.555 --> 09:16.727
(man) CAN WE GET ONE MORE?
PLEASE COME WITH ME.

09:16.727 --> 09:17.858
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
(sighs)

09:17.858 --> 09:19.259
ARE YOU BAILING
ON THE WEDDING?
WHAT?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.692
NO! I'M NOT BAIL--
WHY WOULD SAY THAT?

09:21.692 --> 09:22.833
NO, I NEED YOU.
COME WITH ME.

09:22.833 --> 09:25.696
GENTLEMEN, AS YOU KNOW,
THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF

09:25.696 --> 09:27.938
HAS ISSUED A MANDATE
FOR OUR COMMUNITY...
(Bailey fussing)

09:27.938 --> 09:31.001
TO DEVISE A FULL AND COMPLETE
MAP OF THE HUMAN BRAIN.
SHH. SHH.

09:31.001 --> 09:32.172
(man) KLEISS NEUROSCIENCE
WANTS TO LEAD

09:32.172 --> 09:33.644
THE PACK TOWARDS THAT GOAL.
SHH. SHH. SHH.

09:33.644 --> 09:35.806
WE'VE GOT A HUGE N.I.H. GRANT
TO DO IT WITH.

09:35.806 --> 09:37.848
THE FIRST STEPS WILL BE
DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY.

09:37.848 --> 09:39.810
THE SENSORS YOU DEVELOP
FOR YOUR B.C.I. WORK

09:39.810 --> 09:42.182
ARE THE MOST RESPONSIVE
WE'VE SEEN.
I'M FLATTERED. THANK YOU.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.614
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

09:43.614 --> 09:45.786
I'M AFRAID THAT DR. TORRES
AND MY B.C.I. WORK

09:45.786 --> 09:47.988
IS ALL-CONSUMING.
I-I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.721
THIS WILL BE THE, UH,
COMPENSATION THAT YOU'LL RECEIVE

09:50.721 --> 09:53.123
JUST FOR CONSULTING
LONG-DISTANCE.

09:53.123 --> 09:54.294
OKAY, SEE, I'M NOT EVEN
GONNA TURN THAT OVER.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.798
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE COMPENSATION.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.700
TURN OVER THE PAPER.
I DON'T WANT TO.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.632
JUST... TURN IT OVER.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.

10:01.632 --> 10:03.033
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH MONEY IT IS.

10:03.033 --> 10:04.675
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
WILL YOU AT LEAST
WATCH OUR MOVIE?

10:04.675 --> 10:07.678
YES. YES, HE WILL.
(clears throat)

10:07.678 --> 10:08.739
(lowered voice) JUST LISTEN
TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

10:08.739 --> 10:09.940
ABSOLUTELY.
(switch clicks)

10:09.940 --> 10:13.784
(woman) KLEISS NEUROSCIENCE...

10:13.784 --> 10:16.046
MAPPING THE WAY TO TOMORROW.
(whispering) OKAY, OKAY.

10:16.046 --> 10:18.188
YOU JUST--YOU WANNA WATCH
THE MOVIE? HERE WE GO.

10:18.188 --> 10:19.950
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

10:19.950 --> 10:22.653
ONCE MORE. UP.

10:22.653 --> 10:24.024
(grunts)

10:24.024 --> 10:25.896
UGH! I'M TOO TIRED.

10:25.896 --> 10:28.098
(breathing heavily)
SORRY, DARLIN'.

10:28.098 --> 10:29.199
COULD YOU, UH,
GIVE US A SEC?

10:36.266 --> 10:37.637
I GOT A QUESTION.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.711
I RECOGNIZED YOU
THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU.

10:40.711 --> 10:42.713
HOW DO YOU FORGET
A WIFE AND THREE KIDS?

10:42.713 --> 10:45.215
HOW--HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

10:45.215 --> 10:47.377
I MADE SUCH A MESS
OF EVERYTHING.

10:47.377 --> 10:49.850
THE MORE TIME WENT BY,
THE MORE DRUGS I DID,

10:49.850 --> 10:51.782
THE MORE I LET MYSELF FORGET

10:51.782 --> 10:53.383
'CAUSE I COULDN'T
STAND MYSELF. YOU KNOW?

10:53.383 --> 10:57.087
I REMEMBER YOU, THOUGH.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.730
I REMEMBER YOU USED
TO LAUGH IN YOUR SLEEP.

10:59.730 --> 11:01.932
WELL, THAT'S WHEN
I WAS, LIKE, 4, RIGHT?

11:01.932 --> 11:03.694
YOU WERE JUST
A HAPPY KID.

11:04.935 --> 11:07.337
I GUESS I FIXED THAT, HUH?

11:07.337 --> 11:11.842
YEAH, I REMEMBER YOU TOOK ME
TO THE FAIR ONCE.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.804
IT'S, UH, ONE OF THOSE
TRAVELLING ONES

11:13.804 --> 11:15.946
WHERE ALL THE RIDES
ARE CRAPPY AND YOU MIGHT DIE.

11:15.946 --> 11:17.177
(chuckles)

11:17.177 --> 11:21.311
(chuckles) BUT, UH, WE RODE
EVERY RIDE TWICE.

11:21.311 --> 11:22.953
IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT.
I REMEMBER THAT.

11:22.953 --> 11:26.016
YOUR MOM WAS HAVING
A MELTDOWN.

11:26.016 --> 11:27.858
SHE WAS TEARING
THE WALLPAPER OF THE WALLS,

11:27.858 --> 11:29.389
SAYING SOMEONE
WAS HIDING IN THERE.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.823
(sighs) THAT WOMAN WAS SUCH
A DAMN MESS--

11:32.823 --> 11:33.764
WHAT ABOUT THIS
OTHER FAMILY?

11:33.764 --> 11:35.996
I MEAN, HOW'D YOU LEAVE IT
WITH THEM?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.928
BETTER.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.429
I COULD MAYBE TRY
AND GO BACK.

11:39.429 --> 11:41.832
NAOMI'S TOUGH,
BUT SHE'S NOT YOUR MOTHER.

11:41.832 --> 11:43.033
SHE'S NOT BUG-EYED CRAZY.

11:43.033 --> 11:44.805
ALL RIGHT, THIS HAS GOT
TO STOP NOW.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.207
(scoffs) MOM WAS NOT
THE PROBLEM.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.139
I'M NOT TRYING
TO BAD-TALK YOUR MOTHER,

11:49.139 --> 11:51.241
BUT YOU CAN'T KNOW
WHAT A STRAIN IT IS

11:51.241 --> 11:52.312
BEING WITH SOMEONE
LIKE THAT.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.084
WHO DO YOU THINK
TOOK CARE OF HER?

11:54.084 --> 11:56.316
KEPT TRACK OF HER.?

11:56.316 --> 11:59.019
GOT HER COMMITTED
SO SHE WOULDN'T HURT HERSELF?

11:59.019 --> 12:01.491
WHO DO YOU THINK
TOOK CARE OF YOUR KIDS?!

12:01.491 --> 12:03.723
I DID THE BEST I COULD.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.396
OH, WELL, IF THAT'S YOUR BEST
THAN YOU SHOULD JUST HANG IT UP!

12:06.396 --> 12:08.298
YOUR BEST IS WORTHLESS!

12:08.298 --> 12:10.460
I WAS THE DAD!

12:10.460 --> 12:12.833
I WAS A KID,
BUT I WAS THE DAD!

12:12.833 --> 12:14.404
YOU WERE NOTHING!

12:14.404 --> 12:16.837
YOU... WERE GONE!

12:16.837 --> 12:17.868
YOU'RE WORTHLESS!

12:17.868 --> 12:20.010
OKAY! OKAY, OKAY.

12:20.010 --> 12:24.144
(panting) WALK AWAY.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.183
OKAY, I CAN FUSE C-5 AND 6,
BUT I HAVE TO WORK FAST

12:33.183 --> 12:34.855
IF WE EVEN WANT A SHOT
AT AVOIDING PARALYSIS.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.486
OH, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE A GENIUS. 10 BLADE.

12:36.486 --> 12:38.458
I AM, ACTUALLY,
WELL, SORT OF A GENIUS.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.230
DEREK AND I START
PHASE TWO TODAY--

12:40.230 --> 12:42.232
TACTILE PRESSURE
FEEDBACK.

12:42.232 --> 12:44.494
AWESOME! GOOD FOR YOU.
(chuckles)

12:44.494 --> 12:46.036
WELL, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU, TOO.

12:46.036 --> 12:47.868
THE GOAL IS
A PROSTHETIC LEG, UH,

12:47.868 --> 12:50.801
AS SENSITIVE AND AS RESPONSIVE
AS THE ONE THAT YOU LOST.

12:50.801 --> 12:52.202
GET YOU BACK
TO WHERE YOU WERE.

12:52.202 --> 12:56.076
OKAY, UM, PREP THE NECK.
I'M GONNA SCRUB.

12:56.076 --> 12:58.508
HEY, I TOLD YOU I'D CALL YOU
IF I NEED YOU.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.150
HOW'S YOUR DAD?
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?

13:00.150 --> 13:03.353
(suction gurgling)

13:03.353 --> 13:04.955
GRAB A CLAMP.

13:04.955 --> 13:06.056
HELP ME FIND THE BLEEDERS.

13:07.918 --> 13:10.220
(printer whirring)

13:10.220 --> 13:12.292
MEREDITH!
APRIL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.424
OH, GOD. ARE YOU MAKING
A BREAK FOR IT?

13:14.424 --> 13:16.366
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
REALLY?

13:16.366 --> 13:17.868
WHY DOES EVERYBODY
THINK I'M RUNNING?

13:17.868 --> 13:19.870
I'M NOT RUNNING.
COME WITH ME.

13:19.870 --> 13:21.301
BUT I--
NO.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.432
YOU BAILED ON EVERY
SINGLE ONE OF YOUR FITTINGS

13:22.432 --> 13:25.035
FOR YOUR BRIDESMAID'S
DRESS, SO...

13:25.035 --> 13:26.837
I BROUGHT THE SEAMSTRESS
TO YOU.

13:26.837 --> 13:28.478
YOU WILL LOOK PRETTY
FOR MY WEDDING.

13:28.478 --> 13:30.981
(woman) HELLO.
NO CLOTHES, PLEASE.

13:30.981 --> 13:33.313
(telephone rings)

13:33.313 --> 13:35.345
YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE DOING THIS STUFF FOR ME.

13:35.345 --> 13:37.447
(door slams shut)

13:39.389 --> 13:41.451
I SAW YOUR, UH,
PRESS CONFERENCE.

13:41.451 --> 13:43.493
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
UP THERE?

13:43.493 --> 13:46.196
I WAS SUPPOSED TO TELL THEM
WHAT I DID,

13:46.196 --> 13:47.898
BUT I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE.

13:47.898 --> 13:49.199
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

13:49.199 --> 13:51.131
I'M NOT SURE
WHY THE KID IS STILL ALIVE.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.832
THE CONDUIT?
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD FAIL?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.434
IT DID FAIL.
WE ADJUSTED,

13:54.434 --> 13:55.936
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I DID, MER.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.208
IT'S LIKE SLAPPING
THE SIDE OF A TV.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.470
I FIXED IT,
BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.442
I FEEL LIKE
A COMPLETE FRAUD.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.414
SO YOU JUST WENT AHEAD
ANYWAY?

14:04.414 --> 14:06.416
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T MENTION
THAT TO ANYONE?
WELL...

14:06.416 --> 14:08.348
TO WHO, MER? YOU WEREN'T
TALKING TO ME,

14:08.348 --> 14:09.519
ALEX WAS AGAINST ME.

14:09.519 --> 14:12.122
I HAD NO ONE.
I HAD NO CHOICE.

14:12.122 --> 14:14.925
IT WAS HIS BEST SHOT.

14:16.887 --> 14:19.159
WOW. YOU WERE RIGHT.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.162
WE ARE IN TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PLACES.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.494
MER, PLEASE.
NO, I MEAN, I--
I MAY OVERREACH,

14:24.494 --> 14:26.066
AND I MAY HAVE SOMETHING
TO PROVE,

14:26.066 --> 14:29.439
BUT... I WILL NEVER
BE AS ARROGANT AS YOU ARE.

14:29.439 --> 14:31.071
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEREDITH?

14:31.071 --> 14:33.003
GO TO HELL.

14:33.003 --> 14:35.175
I HAVE LISTENED
TO YOUR CRAP FOR WEEKS NOW,

14:35.175 --> 14:38.578
AND I'M NOT GONNA STAND HERE
AND TAKE IT ANYMORE.
YOU STAND HERE.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.980
(woman on TV) AND THAT'S WHY
AT KLEISS NEUROSCIENCE

14:39.980 --> 14:43.453
TOMORROW IS TODAY.
(switch clicks)

14:43.453 --> 14:45.515
WELL?
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

14:45.515 --> 14:48.188
LIKE I SAID,
I'M OVEREXTENDED.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.160
DEREK, THEY'RE JUST
ASKING FOR A CONSULT.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.562
THIS IS NOT
A RELOCATION, RIGHT?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:52.562 --> 14:53.663
JUST, IT'D BE
A COUPLE OF VISITS

14:53.663 --> 14:54.925
EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

14:54.925 --> 14:56.026
ONCE AGAIN, I'M FLATTERED,
BUT I-I--

14:56.026 --> 14:57.227
I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE TIME.

14:57.227 --> 14:59.129
JUST GUIDE US
IN WHAT WE'RE DOING.
NO.

14:59.129 --> 15:00.500
NOT IF THIS
IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
WAIT, YOU THINK
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

15:00.500 --> 15:02.232
WITH--WITH OUR APPROACH.
OUR METHOD IS
THE BLEEDING EDGE OF--

15:02.232 --> 15:04.504
YOUR METHOD COULDN'T MAP
THE HUMAN SPHINCTER.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.436
DEREK.
I'M SORRY,
BUT THEY--THEY--

15:06.436 --> 15:07.437
THEY MADE ME.

15:07.437 --> 15:11.241
(inhales deeply)
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A PLANET.

15:11.241 --> 15:13.383
I'M SAYING STEP BACK...

15:13.383 --> 15:14.614
AND LOOK AT THE UNIVERSE.

15:16.446 --> 15:20.920
YOU DON'T KISS SOMEONE
BY PUCKERING YOUR LIPS.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.394
YOU SEE SOMEONE AND YOU
REMEMBER WHY YOU DESIRE THEM.

15:24.394 --> 15:27.327
YOUR SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
QUICKENS YOUR PULSE,

15:27.327 --> 15:28.458
YOUR FRONTAL LOBE
LOWERS YOUR INHIBITIONS,

15:28.458 --> 15:31.231
AND YOU NEED TO KISS THEM.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.462
IT HAPPENS
ALL AT ONCE.

15:32.462 --> 15:35.635
WE'RE IMPULSIVE
AND COMPULSIVE.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.607
THAT'S HOW THE BRAIN WORKS.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.369
STOP LOOKING AT
WHAT WE DO.

15:39.369 --> 15:41.311
LOOK AT WHY WE DO IT.

15:41.311 --> 15:43.243
IS HE SAYING
CHANGE THE SENSOR PLACEMENT?

15:43.243 --> 15:44.944
NO, YOU DON'T GET IT, TIM.
I WANT TO.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.177
HE'S SAYING
CHANGE EVERYTHING.

15:47.177 --> 15:49.219
(man) HE IS SAYING...
WHERE ARE YOU...

15:49.219 --> 15:51.221
THIS DIFFUSER/TENSOR IMAGING
IS OLD NEWS.
SHH. SHH. SHH. SHH. SHH.

15:51.221 --> 15:53.083
HE'S SAYING THAT CORTICAL
FIRING WILL GIVE US...
THEY'RE STARTING TO GET IT.

15:53.083 --> 15:56.686
DEEPER CUTS AND FASTER
PICTURES OF THE WHOLE BRAIN.

15:56.686 --> 15:58.328
OH, YOU KNOW THAT DRESS--

15:58.328 --> 16:01.131
THE PURPLE ONE
WITH THE STRIPES?
YEAH.

16:01.131 --> 16:03.333
IT DOES MAKE YOU LOOK FAT.
WHAT?!

16:03.333 --> 16:05.195
YOU SAID IT WAS PRETTY.
I LIED.

16:05.195 --> 16:07.367
(gasps)
BUT I WANT MY LAST WORDS
TO BE HONEST ONES.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.140
YOU ARE GORGEOUS.
BUT IN THAT DRESS--

16:10.140 --> 16:12.372
BASTARD.
YOU LOOK LIKE
A PARADE FLOAT.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.044
I WORE THAT DRESS
TO THREE WEDDINGS.

16:14.044 --> 16:16.376
(off-key)
♪ IT HAD TO BE YOU ♪

16:16.376 --> 16:18.448
MM.
(normal voice) IT'S OUR SONG.
LAST CHANCE, HON.

16:18.448 --> 16:20.450
♪ IT HAD TO BE YOU ♪
(sighs)

16:20.450 --> 16:22.452
GUYS, THE RISK OF DAMAGE
TO YOUR VOCAL CHORDS

16:22.452 --> 16:24.554
ARE SO MINIMAL.
CUT THEM.
CUT THE CHORDS, PLEASE.

16:24.554 --> 16:27.417
(chuckles) UH, THIS IS
YOUR LAST STOP, KAREN.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.490
HEY. COME HERE.

16:31.761 --> 16:35.365
(whispering inaudibly)

16:35.365 --> 16:37.427
(chuckles)

16:38.528 --> 16:42.572
(sobs and sniffles)

16:42.572 --> 16:45.335
(kisses)

16:45.335 --> 16:48.208
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.441
(door opens)

16:51.441 --> 16:54.514
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

16:54.514 --> 16:55.585
(Miranda)
MOVE IT MORE LATERALLY.

16:55.585 --> 16:57.647
THERE.

16:57.647 --> 16:59.549
GOT IT.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.453
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

17:03.453 --> 17:05.225
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SPOKEN
TO YOU THAT WAY.

17:05.225 --> 17:07.627
WHY? YOU GOT
WHAT YOU WANTED.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.399
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:09.399 --> 17:12.562
PART OF MY JOB
IS TO TEACH YOU.

17:12.562 --> 17:14.564
I HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT.

17:14.564 --> 17:17.567
I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS
BEING REWARDED OR PUNISHED.

17:17.567 --> 17:19.409
PART OF MY MYSTIQUE.

17:19.409 --> 17:21.411
OH, GET THAT ONE.
(squishing)

17:25.115 --> 17:28.178
NEVER BE AFRAID
TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

17:28.178 --> 17:30.420
JUST BE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT
WHEN YOU DO.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.583
THAT'S SO TRUE.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.825
I HAVE TO STAND UP
FOR WHAT I DESERVE.

17:35.825 --> 17:38.528
THAT IS SO INCREDIBLY TRUE.

17:38.528 --> 17:40.660
I KNOW, I SAID IT.
EH, YOU MISSED THAT ONE.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.193
YOU TELL ME
HOW YOU CAN GIVE

17:43.193 --> 17:45.465
100% TO YOUR FAMILY
AND 100% TO YOUR JOB.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.537
UH, IT--IT'S
CATEGORICALLY IMPOSSIBLE--

17:47.537 --> 17:50.400
BECAUSE YOU KEEP SCREWING
WITH MY RESEARCH.
OH, GOD, MER.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.542
MY BORROWING YOUR PRINTER
HAD NOTHING TO DO

17:52.542 --> 17:53.473
WITH YOUR DEAD SHEEP.

17:53.473 --> 17:55.345
DID YOU EVER THINK MAYBE
YOUR RESEARCH IS FAILING

17:55.345 --> 17:57.407
ALL ON IT'S OWN?
RIGHT, BECAUSE
I'M A TERRIBLE DOCTOR.

17:57.407 --> 17:59.579
WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.
NO, I NEVER SAID THAT.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.711
YOU SAID THAT--
I NEVER SAID THAT!

18:01.711 --> 18:04.614
BUT YOU SAID I WAS
A TERRIBLE PERSON...

18:04.614 --> 18:07.257
OVER AND OVER...

18:07.257 --> 18:09.189
BECAUSE I DON'T
AGREE WITH YOU.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.261
BECAUSE I'M COMMITTED
TO MY WORK.

18:11.261 --> 18:13.163
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
A BABY?

18:13.163 --> 18:15.565
WHEN DID I BECOME
SUCH A MONSTER TO YOU?

18:15.565 --> 18:17.597
CAN I TALK TO YOU?
UGH.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.369
SHANE, GO AWAY.

18:19.369 --> 18:20.570
I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HEAR WHAT
YOU DID, AND YOU DOWNPLAYED IT.

18:20.570 --> 18:21.801
SHANE, I SAID GET OUT!
GO HOME!

18:21.801 --> 18:23.273
AND I WAS RIGHT.

18:23.273 --> 18:25.835
WHAT?
AN E-MAIL FROM
THE HARPER AVERY FOUNDATION

18:25.835 --> 18:27.677
REQUESTING A CASE STUDY
AND PATIENT STATUS.

18:27.677 --> 18:29.439
WHAT?
YOU'RE IN CONSIDERATION
FOR THIS YEAR'S AWARD.

18:29.439 --> 18:32.312
(paper rustles)

18:32.312 --> 18:35.345
(sighs)

18:35.345 --> 18:37.547
NOW YOU TAKE OFF,
AND YOU TAKE OFF.

18:37.547 --> 18:41.120
(door opens and closes)

18:46.656 --> 18:47.827
(Callie) ARE YOU GONNA WEAR
YOUR HIGH-HEEL LEG?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.128
'CAUSE IT LOOKS AMAZING.
BUT YOU ALWAYS GET SO SORE

18:49.128 --> 18:51.201
AFTER A WHILE. OH, ALSO,
IT'S ON A FARM,

18:51.201 --> 18:52.832
SO IT MIGHT BE MUDDY. YOU--
I'LL BE FINE.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.864
OKAY.
WERE YOU ABLE
TO DECOMPRESS THE CORD?

18:54.864 --> 18:57.567
IS HE PARALYZED?
UH, IT'S TOO SOON TO TELL.

18:57.567 --> 18:58.838
YOU GONNA TELL THE DAD?
TELL THE DAD WHAT?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.770
THE SPINAL INJURY
WAS LIKELY CAUSED

19:00.770 --> 19:02.172
BY THE FATHER
TRANSPORTING HIM.

19:02.172 --> 19:03.643
OH, GOD.
YOU WAIT FOR AN AMBULANCE.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.844
WELL, HE DIDN'T KNOW.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.446
YEAH, WELL, AND NOW MAYBE
HIS KID MIGHT NOT WALK?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.147
I MEAN, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER OFF IF HE HAD JUST

19:08.147 --> 19:10.149
KEPT HIS HANDS OFF.
CALLIE, STOP IT.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.452
HIS KID WAS HURT,
AND HE WAS TRYING TO FIX IT.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.883
SOMETIMES WE TRY
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER

19:13.883 --> 19:15.625
AND WE HAVE NO IDEA THAT WE'RE
ACTUALLY CAUSING MORE PAIN.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.926
OF COURSE WE DON'T TELL HIM.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.860
(sighs) NO.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.462
I CANT GET IN THERE
TO STAPLE.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.164
THERE'S TOO MANY STRICTURES.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.836
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA
GO IN THROUGH HIS NECK.

19:28.398 --> 19:30.840
(whispers) OKAY.
YEAH.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.772
THERE YOU GO.

19:34.304 --> 19:35.845
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE SAID TO HER?

19:35.845 --> 19:37.247
NO IDEA.

19:37.247 --> 19:38.608
THOUGH, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S MUCH

19:38.608 --> 19:39.679
THEY WOULDN'T SAY
TO EACH OTHER.
(gloves snap)

19:39.679 --> 19:41.411
RIGHT? HOW DO YOU GET
TO THAT POINT?

19:41.411 --> 19:43.182
THERE'S NOTHING
I WOULDN'T SAY TO YOU.
OH, I DOUBT THAT.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.484
WE ARE NOWHERE NEAR
THAT POINT.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.655
YOU SHED.

19:45.655 --> 19:47.857
YOU SHED HAIR.
YOU SHED BRAS.

19:47.857 --> 19:50.189
THAT IS UNTRUE
AND UNKIND.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.561
YOU STAY OVER MY PLACE
FOR THE WEEKEND,

19:51.561 --> 19:52.962
AND THERE'S HAIR
ALL OVER EVERY PILLOW,

19:52.962 --> 19:53.863
AND A BRA
ON EVERY DOOR KNOB.

19:53.863 --> 19:56.396
YOU GOT A BRA
IN MY SILVERWARE DRAWER.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.967
OH, WHICH ONE?
WAS IT BLUE?
HOW DO YOU HAVE
SO MANY BRAS?

19:57.967 --> 20:00.370
WELL, YOU HAVE
ANGRY FACE.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.232
I HAVE ANGRY FACE?

20:02.232 --> 20:03.733
YEAH, WHEN YOU ARE THINKING
OR SOLVING A PROBLEM

20:03.733 --> 20:06.276
OR JUST COUNTING CHANGE,
PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE PISSED OFF.

20:06.276 --> 20:08.338
WELL, I'M NOT PISSED OFF.
WELL, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST YOUR FACE.

20:08.338 --> 20:09.909
I'M GETTING PISSED OFF.
THEN YOU SHOULD SMILE MORE.

20:09.909 --> 20:13.843
(chuckles)
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

20:13.843 --> 20:16.286
(sighs)
(instruments clattering)

20:18.217 --> 20:19.589
I THINK HE SAID
HE LOVED HER.

20:19.589 --> 20:20.990
MAYBE. (chuckles)

20:20.990 --> 20:23.393
SAY IT LOUD
AND GO FROM THERE.

20:23.393 --> 20:24.854
WHAT?

20:24.854 --> 20:26.926
NO, IT'S SOMETHING
MARK SLOAN SAID TO ME ONCE.

20:26.926 --> 20:30.960
(woman) HE'S READY, DOCTORS.
HE SAID, UH,
"IF YOU LOVE SOMEBODY,

20:30.960 --> 20:32.732
"YOU TELL 'EM,
EVEN IF YOU'RE SCARED

20:32.732 --> 20:34.434
"IT'LL CAUSE PROBLEMS

20:34.434 --> 20:36.666
"OR BURN YOUR LIFE
TO THE GROUND.

20:36.666 --> 20:40.970
SAY IT LOUD
AND GO FROM THERE."
THAT'S NICE.

20:44.013 --> 20:45.675
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

20:45.675 --> 20:46.846
AAH!
OH, MY GOD!

20:46.846 --> 20:48.448
(gurney crashes)

20:48.448 --> 20:49.779
(scoffs) WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?!
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:49.779 --> 20:50.950
(telephone rings in distance)

20:50.950 --> 20:52.422
I'M WORKING.
ON OUR WEDDING DAY?

20:52.422 --> 20:54.824
I HAVE TO EARN ENOUGH TO TAKE
TIME OFF AFTER OUR WEDDING DAY.

20:54.824 --> 20:55.955
(sighs deeply) YOU SAW ME.
BARELY.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.458
I-I DIDN'T SEE YOUR DRESS.
I DIDN'T SEE YOUR HAIR.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.629
DO YOU HAVE
A REALLY BIG HAT ON?

20:59.629 --> 21:01.030
THIS IS SUCH BAD LUCK!

21:01.030 --> 21:01.991
(stomps foot)
SUCH BAD LUCK!

21:01.991 --> 21:03.893
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.
(huffs)

21:03.893 --> 21:06.296
IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD, 'CAUSE...
(sighs)

21:06.296 --> 21:07.597
IF THE FIRST TIME
I SAW YOU TODAY

21:07.597 --> 21:10.600
WAS IN THE DRESS WITH THE HAIR,
LOOKING THAT BEAUTIFUL,

21:10.600 --> 21:14.273
I WOULD JUST BE REMINDED
OF HOW MUCH I DON'T DESERVE YOU,

21:14.273 --> 21:16.376
AND I'D PROBABLY PASS OUT.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.947
AND WE'D WIND UP BACK HERE.
WE WOULDN'T BE MARRIED.

21:17.947 --> 21:20.610
THEY'D HAVE TO CUT OFF MY SUIT,
AND I'M STILL PAYING FOR IT.

21:20.610 --> 21:21.881
(laughs)

21:21.881 --> 21:23.553
(laughs)

21:23.553 --> 21:26.916
I'M GLAD I SAW YOU
LIKE THIS,

21:26.916 --> 21:28.888
'CAUSE I'M GONNA SEE YOU
LIKE THIS A LOT MORE

21:28.888 --> 21:31.321
THAN I'LL SEE YOU LIKE THAT
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

21:31.321 --> 21:34.694
AND I LOVE YOU LIKE THIS.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.866
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

21:36.866 --> 21:38.568
I CAN'T WAIT.

21:38.568 --> 21:40.029
(inhales deeply)

21:40.029 --> 21:43.333
OH! HEY, DON'T FORGET
BLACK SOCKS.

21:43.333 --> 21:45.034
MATTHEW?

21:45.034 --> 21:47.907
(siren wailing in distance)

21:52.582 --> 21:53.713
MATTHEW?

21:53.713 --> 21:55.915
IT'S POSSIBLE THE LACK
OF NERVE RESPONSE IS DUE

21:55.915 --> 21:59.519
TO, UH, TRAUMA AND SWELLING
TO THE SPINAL CORD.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.821
IT COULD RECEDE WITH TIME.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.924
AND--AND IF IT DOESN'T?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.027
WE'RE LOOKING AT PARALYSIS,

22:08.027 --> 22:09.629
LIKELY QUADRIPLEGIA.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.800
(cries)

22:10.800 --> 22:11.961
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

22:11.961 --> 22:13.503
(inhales deeply)

22:13.503 --> 22:15.405
(exhales deeply)

22:15.405 --> 22:18.608
IT'S MY FAULT, ISN'T IT?

22:20.109 --> 22:22.542
(voice breaking) HE WAS MOVING
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.745
THEN I BROUGHT HIM HERE.

22:25.745 --> 22:28.548
I DID THIS.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.550
(crying) I DID THIS TO HIM.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.081
YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP HIM.

22:32.081 --> 22:34.023
WHATEVER HAPPENS,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

22:34.023 --> 22:36.856
LOOK, YOU WERE JUST TRYING TO DO
YOUR BEST FOR YOUR KID.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.089
(sobbing)
OKAY?

22:43.893 --> 22:46.736
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, I WASN'T
ABLE TO ACCESS THE DIVERTICULUM

22:46.736 --> 22:48.638
WITH THE SCOPE,
SO WE WENT IN SURGICALLY.

22:48.638 --> 22:50.039
BUT IT WENT SEAMLESSLY...
(gasps)

22:50.039 --> 22:51.901
AND HE IS GONNA HAVE
VERY FRESH BREATH.

22:51.901 --> 22:53.643
(laughs) THANK YOU.

22:53.643 --> 22:54.804
HE'S WAKING UP.

22:54.804 --> 22:56.776
(whispers) ALL RIGHT.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.877
HI, HONEY.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.381
W-WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

23:02.381 --> 23:04.013
PAGE SHEPHERD RIGHT AWAY.
(woman) DALTON?

23:04.013 --> 23:05.615
EXCUSE ME.

23:05.615 --> 23:07.887
(groaning)
DALTON?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.159
I CAN COMPETE AS A MOTHER
AND AS A SURGEON.

23:10.159 --> 23:12.021
YOU JUST DON'T THINK I CAN
COMPETE AGAINST YOU.

23:12.021 --> 23:14.994
YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE, MER,
THIS IS ALL I DO.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.766
THIS IS ALL I WANT TO DO.

23:16.766 --> 23:19.929
SO DON'T WHINE TO ME BECAUSE YOU
MADE A DECISION YOU REGRET NOW.

23:19.929 --> 23:21.070
YOU THINK I REGRET MY FAMILY?!

23:21.070 --> 23:24.574
I THINK YOU FEEL LEFT BEHIND.
AND THAT SUCKS FOR YOU,

23:24.574 --> 23:26.436
BUT NO ONE FORCED YOU
OUT OF THE GAME.

23:26.436 --> 23:27.607
I AM NOT OUT OF THE GAME!

23:27.607 --> 23:29.679
I JUST WON'T SABOTAGE MY FRIENDS
TO WIN IT!

23:29.679 --> 23:32.041
OH. OH, IS THAT WHAT I DO?
THAT'S WHAT SHARKS DO.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.443
YOU CALLED IT OUR FIRST DAY.

23:33.443 --> 23:36.486
WELL, AS I RECALL,
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

23:36.486 --> 23:37.947
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SLEEPING
WITH SHANE?

23:37.947 --> 23:41.050
(Palma Violets) ♪ I WANNA BE
YOUR BEST FRIEND ♪

23:41.050 --> 23:43.553
HE BLUSHES
AT AN EXPOSED ANKLE.

23:43.553 --> 23:45.895
HE SAW YOU IN YOUR UNDERWEAR
AND DIDN'T BAT AN EYE.

23:45.895 --> 23:48.127

32:11.130 --> 32:13.402

YOU WOULDN'T LET ME HELP HIM.

32:13.402 --> 32:15.004
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANNA DO?

32:17.436 --> 32:18.968

32:20.109 --> 32:22.241

32:22.241 --> 32:23.442
AAH! THANK YOU!
(laughs)

32:23.442 --> 32:25.114
I KNEW YOU'D MAKE IT.

32:25.114 --> 32:27.016
OKAY, SO WHEN WE GET OUT THERE,
ARIZONA'S GONNA TAKE MY BOUQUET.

32:27.016 --> 32:29.018
SO IF YOU AND MEREDITH CAN BE
ON EITHER SIDE OF MY TRAIN,

32:29.018 --> 32:30.649
I--
HOW DARE YOU SAY
I HAVEN'T CHANGED.

32:30.649 --> 32:33.222
I DON'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY
MY CHOICES TO YOU, NOT ONE.

32:33.222 --> 32:35.254
HOW DARE YOU SAY I AM THE SAME
PERSON I WAS WHEN I GOT HERE,

32:35.254 --> 32:38.157
BEFORE I KNEW BURKE
AND OWEN AND YOU.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.129
YOUR LIFE LOOKS DIFFERENT

32:40.129 --> 32:42.591
BECAUSE IT'S FILLED WITH HOUSES
AND HUSBANDS AND KIDS.

32:42.591 --> 32:46.095
AND MY MINE LOOKS THE SAME,
BUT I'M NOT.

32:46.095 --> 32:48.497
I'VE CHANGED.
I'M DOING THIS ALONE.

32:48.497 --> 32:51.040
AND THAT'S...

32:51.040 --> 32:54.173
THAT'S JUST AS HARD
AS WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

32:54.173 --> 32:57.006
BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD AT LEAST
HAVE YOU.

33:00.349 --> 33:03.212
I'M SO JEALOUS OF YOU,
I WANNA SET THINGS ON FIRE.

33:03.212 --> 33:05.684
YOU DID WHAT I TRIED TO DO,
AND I COULDN'T.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.416
AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW YOU DID IT.

33:07.416 --> 33:08.757
YOU HAVE NOTHING
BUT TIME AND FOCUS.

33:08.757 --> 33:10.759
YOU'RE NOT WHO WE WERE
WHEN WE GOT HERE.

33:10.759 --> 33:13.092
YOU ARE WHO WE BOTH
SET OUT TO BE.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.724
AND YOU'VE BECOME
SOMETHING...

33:15.724 --> 33:17.566
WE NEVER SAW COMING.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.073
YOU ARE AS GOOD A MOTHER

33:24.073 --> 33:26.105
AS YOU ARE A SURGEON.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.577
AND I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

33:30.239 --> 33:32.481
BUT WE ARE GROWING APART.
I KNOW.

33:32.481 --> 33:36.014
AND I DON'T WANNA COMPETE
WITH YOU, BUT I DO,

33:36.014 --> 33:37.316
BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO PUSH EACH OTHER

33:37.316 --> 33:39.248
AND MAKE EACH OTHER BETTER
FOREVER.

33:39.248 --> 33:42.151
SINCE THE DAY WE MET, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

33:42.151 --> 33:44.723
OKAY. SO THEN--
GOD, I KNOW.
I'M SO GLAD BECAUSE--

33:44.723 --> 33:46.295
OH! SHUT UP!

33:46.295 --> 33:49.027

33:52.030 --> 33:53.332
BUT NOT TODAY.

33:53.332 --> 33:54.563
AND YOU! YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:54.563 --> 33:55.664
STOP TALKING ABOUT ADULTERY
ON MY WEDDING DAY,

33:55.664 --> 33:59.468
BECAUSE IT IS MY WEDDING DAY!

33:59.468 --> 34:01.440
I SHOULD BE FEELING
VERY SPECIAL RIGHT NOW.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.573
I SHOULD BE FLOUNCED
AND FLUFFED UP AND CHECKED OVER

34:04.573 --> 34:06.645
AND HANDED TISSUES
AND TOLD NOT TO CRY WITH JOY.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.077

34:08.077 --> 34:11.220

AND YOU MAKE ME FEEL SPECIAL.

34:28.237 --> 34:29.798
OKAY. WE PUT HIM ON BYPASS,
RIGHT? AND PUT A PATCH ON.

34:29.798 --> 34:31.400

ALREADY.

34:31.400 --> 34:32.841

34:41.850 --> 34:43.412

I CAN FIX THIS.

34:43.412 --> 34:45.454
