Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:46.288 --> 00:47.920
How long does it take

00:47.922 --> 00:49.789
to drive from
Kansas to New York?

00:49.791 --> 00:51.491
Uh, 2 days?

00:51.493 --> 00:54.294
You wanna do this
in 16 milliseconds?

00:54.296 --> 00:55.896
Yeah, but round trip.

00:55.898 --> 00:58.931
You know, we're talking about
a lot of money here, Vincent.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.132
I know.

01:00.134 --> 01:01.801
Why me?

01:01.803 --> 01:03.736
Why didn't you go
to Eva Torres?

01:03.738 --> 01:05.104
Eva Torres?

01:05.105 --> 01:07.507
Eva Torres uses human beings
like disposable assets.

01:07.509 --> 01:09.976
And I heard that you once
bought 200 tower cranes

01:09.978 --> 01:11.344
for $1 million a pop

01:11.346 --> 01:13.412
after a 15-minute
interview with some guy

01:13.414 --> 01:14.814
who was desperate for cash.

01:14.816 --> 01:16.215
Is that right?

01:16.217 --> 01:18.651
They were worth a million,
but I got 'em for 500.

01:18.653 --> 01:19.819
Well, whatever it is,

01:19.821 --> 01:21.787
it tells me you're
a man of your word,

01:21.789 --> 01:23.789
and I have a lot of
respect for that, sir.

01:23.791 --> 01:25.793
These numbers are good.

01:27.062 --> 01:29.130
And I am very tempted.

01:30.797 --> 01:35.601
It's nuts, but
I am very tempted.

01:35.603 --> 01:36.602
But?

01:36.604 --> 01:38.104
Why should I trust you

01:38.106 --> 01:39.772
to build this
fiber tunnel?

01:39.774 --> 01:41.207
You don't need
to trust me!

01:41.209 --> 01:42.942
This is like buying
a time machine.

01:42.944 --> 01:45.211
It's like getting the
winning lottery numbers

01:45.213 --> 01:47.546
at the stock market
even before they're drawn.

01:47.548 --> 01:49.315
No.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.316
What?

01:50.318 --> 01:52.051
Why should I trust you?

01:56.090 --> 01:57.491
All right.

01:57.493 --> 02:00.158
Uh, this is gonna sound stupid,

02:00.160 --> 02:02.827
but, uh, all right,
whatever.

02:02.829 --> 02:04.829
Um...

02:04.831 --> 02:07.765
When I was 18, I worked
as a plumber's assistant,

02:07.767 --> 02:09.502
you know,
to pay for school.

02:09.503 --> 02:12.204
And my boss takes me
to this basement in Queens.

02:12.206 --> 02:13.973
I mean, I could
smell the fungus.

02:13.975 --> 02:16.908
And he asked me to unscrew this,
like, 100-pound steel pipe.

02:16.910 --> 02:19.612
You know, he's sipping coffee
in the corner of the room

02:19.614 --> 02:22.481
while he asked me to unscrew
this massive thing by myself,

02:22.483 --> 02:23.982
you know,
for minimum wage, OK?

02:23.984 --> 02:25.317
And the pipe comes loose.

02:25.319 --> 02:28.254
It hits me in the head,
and I'm knocked unconscious.

02:28.256 --> 02:30.022
I swear to God,
all right? And...

02:31.592 --> 02:33.593
I open my eyes.

02:35.428 --> 02:37.896
And hovering above me
is this shadow, OK,

02:37.898 --> 02:39.998
and it's, like,
this weird man.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.735
And he's saying...

02:42.736 --> 02:44.570
He says: "The line.

02:44.572 --> 02:48.139
"The line.
Don't let go of the line."

02:48.141 --> 02:50.375
OK, then I get slapped
in the face,

02:50.377 --> 02:53.344
and that's just my dumb boss,
you know, over me.

02:53.346 --> 02:56.281
But that message is, like,
imprinted in my brain.

02:56.283 --> 02:58.049
That's a good
story, Vincent.

02:58.051 --> 02:59.050
Mm-hmm.

02:59.052 --> 03:00.685
A little over the top.

03:00.687 --> 03:01.686
Yeah.

03:01.688 --> 03:02.887
But it's good.

03:02.889 --> 03:03.987
Thank you.

03:03.989 --> 03:05.490
But I just know

03:05.492 --> 03:09.594
that until I build this
one quintessential line,

03:09.596 --> 03:11.665
I'm not gonna know the answer.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.066
What answer?

03:15.068 --> 03:18.573
What's at the end
of the line.

03:21.106 --> 03:25.809
<i>The Wall Street panic,
in my opinion, is over.</i>

03:25.811 --> 03:27.512
<i>It had to come.</i>

03:27.514 --> 03:29.614
<i>Stock speculation
had become crazy.</i>

03:29.616 --> 03:33.218
<i>There have been
dozens of stock-market crashes</i>

03:33.220 --> 03:35.554
<i>since the Wall Street
Crash of 1929.</i>

03:35.556 --> 03:37.921
<i>Although most brokers tend
to have a short memory,</i>

03:37.923 --> 03:39.624
<i>it was bound to happen again.</i>

03:39.626 --> 03:41.825
<i>Last week, after
Standard & Poor's downgraded</i>

03:41.827 --> 03:43.894
<i>America's credit rating
from AAA to AA+,</i>

03:43.896 --> 03:46.464
<i>the markets plunged
across the planet</i>

03:46.466 --> 03:49.334
<i>from the US to the Middle East,
all the way to Asia.</i>

03:49.336 --> 03:51.336
<i>The speed of transactions
has become</i>

03:51.338 --> 03:53.671
<i>such an important variable
in the market economy,</i>

03:53.673 --> 03:55.806
<i>that faster algorithms
can make millions</i>

03:55.808 --> 03:57.107
<i>in a matter of milliseconds</i>

03:57.109 --> 03:59.209
<i>or can crash entire markets</i>

03:59.211 --> 04:01.279
<i>by triggering mass
defensive responses</i>

04:01.281 --> 04:02.846
<i>from automated computer systems.</i>

04:02.848 --> 04:05.617
<i>According to Marks,
the word on the street</i>

04:05.619 --> 04:08.418
<i>is that millions are
now calculated in milliseconds.</i>

04:08.420 --> 04:10.787
<i>The ripple effect was felt
all over the world...</i>

04:19.466 --> 04:20.798
Oh, shit!

04:25.471 --> 04:26.470
Hey!

04:26.472 --> 04:27.838
You don't lock
your station,

04:27.840 --> 04:29.139
you don't own
your station!

04:29.141 --> 04:30.574
- Fuck off!
- It's too late!

04:30.576 --> 04:31.743
I owed you that one.

04:31.745 --> 04:33.277
What the fuck
did you do?

04:33.279 --> 04:34.780
I'm gonna fuck you up!

04:57.168 --> 04:58.302
Mark!

04:58.304 --> 04:59.303
Hey, how are you?

04:59.305 --> 05:00.637
Hi! Come on.
How you doing?

05:00.639 --> 05:01.705
Good, you?

05:01.707 --> 05:03.140
Vincent.
My cousin, Anton.

05:03.142 --> 05:04.341
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

05:04.343 --> 05:06.176
You OK? Did you eat?
Are you hungry?

05:06.178 --> 05:07.444
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

05:07.446 --> 05:08.780
So, did you bring the NDA?

05:08.782 --> 05:11.248
It is probably the longest
document I've ever seen.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.448
Sorry about that.

05:12.450 --> 05:13.983
I never had to
sign one before.

05:13.985 --> 05:14.984
- No?
- No.

05:14.986 --> 05:17.487
Let's see.
Uh, you did here.

05:18.590 --> 05:19.989
Uh, all right,
looks good.

05:19.991 --> 05:21.957
So, I spoke to Greg,
who said you're great

05:21.959 --> 05:25.128
and that you could handle any
kind of shit that hits de fan.

05:25.130 --> 05:28.230
Oh, thank you. Yeah, we saw
some funny stuff, Greg and I.

05:28.232 --> 05:30.466
So, what is this
tunnel project about?

05:30.468 --> 05:33.836
Right, so, OK, we want to
dig a 4-inch fiber tunnel

05:33.838 --> 05:36.939
from the Kansas Electronic
Exchange Data Centre

05:36.941 --> 05:39.576
to the New York
Stock Exchange servers,

05:39.578 --> 05:41.311
which are in New Jersey.

05:41.313 --> 05:44.080
Kansas to New Jersey,
that's like...

05:44.082 --> 05:46.248
Yes, it is a straight,
1,000-mile long,

05:46.250 --> 05:47.650
4"-wide fiber tunnel

05:47.652 --> 05:50.386
that has to pierce right
through the Appalachians.

05:50.388 --> 05:53.557
Wow! And can I ask what
the purpose of that line is?

05:53.559 --> 05:56.326
Our purpose is to get
the stock market quotes

05:56.328 --> 05:57.561
in 16 milliseconds,

05:57.563 --> 05:59.729
which is one millisecond
faster than everybody.

05:59.731 --> 06:00.995
It's gonna be very fast,

06:00.997 --> 06:03.132
and it's gonna make us
all very successful.

06:03.134 --> 06:04.333
When you say straight,

06:04.335 --> 06:06.803
how straight are
we talking about here?

06:06.805 --> 06:09.004
From the KAX to the
New York Stock Exchange.

06:09.006 --> 06:10.774
Whatever's in the way,
we dig through.

06:10.776 --> 06:12.709
It's gotta be a
totally straight line.

06:12.711 --> 06:13.710
- Swamps?
- Straight.

06:13.712 --> 06:14.711
- Rivers?
- Straight.

06:14.713 --> 06:15.711
Mountains?

06:15.713 --> 06:16.779
Straight.

06:16.781 --> 06:18.214
Straight,
straight, straight.

06:18.216 --> 06:19.682
Did you bring
what we discussed?

06:20.785 --> 06:22.084
Wow! Yeah, I did.

06:22.086 --> 06:23.586
So, this is 390 miles,

06:23.588 --> 06:27.123
the line I did from
Los Angeles to San Francisco.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.658
I ran 16 crews for 6 months.

06:28.660 --> 06:30.960
Prior to that, 6 months
analyzing the soil,

06:30.962 --> 06:32.260
securing the real estate.

06:32.262 --> 06:34.830
So, from the start
to finish, about a year.

06:34.832 --> 06:38.133
And we delivered 15 days ahead
of schedule on this project.

06:38.135 --> 06:39.468
- Good for you!
- Thank you.

06:39.470 --> 06:41.137
I did everything,
digging, piping,

06:41.139 --> 06:43.072
the soil, real estate
and telecom crew.

06:43.074 --> 06:45.107
My cousin Anton here
has a little test.

06:45.109 --> 06:47.343
I was hoping you wouldn't
mind looking at it.

06:47.345 --> 06:49.745
Sure!

06:49.747 --> 06:53.816
All right, let's say
you wanna dig a tunnel

06:53.818 --> 06:55.851
from Stockholm to Madrid.

06:55.853 --> 06:58.187
- You wanna run fiber through it.
- Yeah.

06:58.189 --> 07:01.624
How many regenerators do you
need to put up on that line?

07:01.626 --> 07:04.726
Taking refraction into
account, obviously.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.129
Of course.

07:17.475 --> 07:19.073
You OK?

07:19.075 --> 07:20.275
Yeah.

07:20.277 --> 07:22.710
Do I have to take
in consideration

07:22.712 --> 07:24.679
the curvature of the Earth,

07:24.681 --> 07:27.515
or can I dig straight, hub,
straight, hub, outside,

07:27.517 --> 07:29.785
in sort of like an octagon?

07:29.787 --> 07:32.187
Now, if you're using
really powerful machines,

07:32.189 --> 07:33.354
which cost more money,

07:33.356 --> 07:35.391
you can dig straight,

07:35.393 --> 07:37.392
come out for
air less often

07:37.394 --> 07:39.494
so you'll have a
straighter line.

07:39.496 --> 07:43.264
And, roughly, we're talking
a difference between,

07:43.266 --> 07:46.871
let's say, a 1,800 miles
and 2,000 miles.

07:51.842 --> 07:53.842
We're not putting
anything online, OK?

07:53.844 --> 07:55.376
This project is
very secret, OK?

07:55.378 --> 07:57.445
I'm gonna be there
every step of the way.

07:57.447 --> 08:00.181
I wanna be on site for meetings,
plannings, interviews.

08:00.183 --> 08:02.417
Whatever it is, I'm there, OK?
No middle man.

08:02.419 --> 08:04.252
Our employer cannot
find out about this.

08:04.254 --> 08:05.553
I can't stress that enough.

08:05.555 --> 08:07.222
What about
real estate contracts?

08:07.224 --> 08:10.023
About 90% percent will be
taken care of by me and my team,

08:10.025 --> 08:11.693
and, well,
you can handle the rest.

08:11.695 --> 08:14.496
Are you sure? 'Cause we're
talking about, like, forests...

08:14.498 --> 08:15.930
- Yeah.
- ...mud, dirt, swamps.

08:15.932 --> 08:17.665
And, like, thousands
of contracts.

08:17.667 --> 08:20.001
I am very sure.
I am very aware, yes.

08:20.003 --> 08:23.171
You know, I have to say
you guys might be crazy,

08:23.173 --> 08:24.605
but I am very excited.

08:24.607 --> 08:26.674
It's a really
interesting project.

08:26.676 --> 08:28.342
Yeah, just think of it

08:28.344 --> 08:31.813
as David walking onto the
floor of the stock exchange,

08:31.815 --> 08:34.047
taking out the biggest
slingshot ever,

08:34.049 --> 08:36.951
and bringing Goliath down
to his fucking knees.

08:36.953 --> 08:38.820
David and Goliath?

08:38.822 --> 08:39.919
Yeah.

08:39.922 --> 08:41.457
- I like that.
- Good.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.693
We're David?

08:45.695 --> 08:47.261
Yeah!

08:47.263 --> 08:49.564
Yeah, we're David.

08:59.808 --> 09:01.009
Katia!

09:06.750 --> 09:09.182
Hi, Dad!
How are you?

09:09.184 --> 09:10.183
Good!

09:10.185 --> 09:11.184
- Hi!
- Yo!

09:11.186 --> 09:12.819
- Hey!
- How's it going?

09:12.821 --> 09:15.322
Well, it's been 9 years.

09:15.324 --> 09:16.557
To you, Pop.

09:16.559 --> 09:20.627
You were the classiest
plumber in New York,

09:20.629 --> 09:22.062
maybe the Tri-State area.

09:22.064 --> 09:27.334
Um, you were
tough on me, but it made me stronger.

09:32.841 --> 09:34.641
Yes, please,
let's eat!

09:34.643 --> 09:39.013
<i>What you wanna do before you do
any kind of tiling</i>

09:39.015 --> 09:40.147
is you strip the pipes,

09:40.149 --> 09:42.016
and you get some
3/4" copper in there.

09:42.018 --> 09:43.317
Change
everything for 3...

09:43.319 --> 09:45.384
No, no, no,
you don't change everything,

09:45.386 --> 09:47.854
just the main line to
the upper floor, that's it.

09:47.856 --> 09:49.890
Don't worry about the basement.

09:49.892 --> 09:54.027
Hey, Dad, why is the light
outside the window blue

09:54.029 --> 09:56.465
and the light inside
the lamp yellow?

09:58.467 --> 10:01.500
Well, because the light waves
from the lamp are slower

10:01.502 --> 10:03.169
than the light waves
from the window,

10:03.171 --> 10:06.039
and slower light waves go
from yellow to orange to red,

10:06.041 --> 10:08.441
and faster light waves
go from blue to violet.

10:08.443 --> 10:09.943
Why is that?

10:09.945 --> 10:12.846
Olena! I didn't
get my song today!

10:12.848 --> 10:14.681
- Oh, she's right!
- Uncle Vinnie!

10:14.683 --> 10:16.616
You didn't give
grandma her song!

10:16.618 --> 10:17.750
Uncle Vinnie!

10:17.752 --> 10:19.352
Yes, OK.
Thank you.

10:19.354 --> 10:20.453
Uncle Vinnie!

10:20.455 --> 10:21.855
It's me. It's me.

10:23.157 --> 10:24.626
Hi!

11:24.952 --> 11:26.118
Yep!

11:26.120 --> 11:27.887
<i>Miss Torres would
like to see you.</i>

11:27.889 --> 11:29.855
What? Just me or...

11:29.857 --> 11:31.189
<i>You and the team.</i>

11:31.191 --> 11:32.527
OK.

11:34.529 --> 11:36.030
Eva wants to see us.

12:05.860 --> 12:07.425
Please take a seat.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.893
Thanks.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.096
They're here.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.269
Well, you tell him
that he had his chance.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.840
If he doesn't deliver
what we paid him to deliver,

12:20.842 --> 12:22.440
he can talk to our lawyers.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.475
And you better
get your shit together!

12:24.477 --> 12:26.144
Gotta go! Bye!

12:26.146 --> 12:27.645
Let's hear it!

12:27.647 --> 12:29.748
What do you have for me?

12:29.750 --> 12:32.484
We're still working
on the microwave towers.

12:32.486 --> 12:34.719
Yeah, we're not working
on microwave towers.

12:34.721 --> 12:35.920
You are not. I am.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.990
- It's pointless.
- Why is it pointless?

12:37.992 --> 12:39.423
We're years away
from getting

12:39.425 --> 12:41.092
the right pulse-shaping
algorithms.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.962
By the time we do, laser towers
will have made us obsolete.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.463
- Jenny?
- He's right.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.899
Short term, I think the crew
should put effort into

12:47.901 --> 12:50.435
getting a fiber deal between
Harrisburg and Allentown

12:50.437 --> 12:52.604
so they can skip
the detour to Philadelphia

12:52.606 --> 12:54.039
and save half a millisecond.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.807
I completely disagree.
We should work on the towers.

12:56.809 --> 12:59.543
If we get them to work,
we'll roundtrip Kansas-New York

12:59.545 --> 13:00.979
in less than
14 milliseconds.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.680
It's a waste of time.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.583
I know one thing that is a waste of time,
that's your neutrino-messaging project.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.085
- Oh, really, is it?
- Really.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.287
What do you know
about neutrino messaging?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.288
- Enlighten me!
- I know it's bullshit!

13:11.290 --> 13:14.259
Yeah, developing a neutrino-
messaging protective shield

13:14.261 --> 13:15.826
will cost at
least $2 billion.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.829
- Fuck you!
- Guys!

13:17.831 --> 13:20.265
I'm wasting my time
listening to this bitching!

13:20.267 --> 13:22.100
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

13:22.102 --> 13:24.636
Jenny, find me a dedicated
dark fiber line

13:24.638 --> 13:26.137
between Harrisburg
and Allentown.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.172
You work on the
microwave thing on your own,

13:28.174 --> 13:29.473
and please prove him wrong.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.408
What are you doing here?

13:31.410 --> 13:33.410
You're wasting time. Go!

13:33.412 --> 13:36.116
Not you!
Not you, Anton.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.386
Close the door, please.

13:50.596 --> 13:51.995
What is it?

13:51.997 --> 13:54.999
I don't know.
You tell me.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.237
Something's not right.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.772
I know you.
Where are your ideas?

14:01.774 --> 14:05.275
Where's that brilliant mind
that you're so proud of?

14:05.277 --> 14:08.078
I'm... I'm working on
neutrino messaging...

14:08.080 --> 14:09.079
Oh, no, no, no!

14:09.081 --> 14:10.480
You don't get to hide

14:10.482 --> 14:13.483
behind this gimmicky
neutrino-messaging bullshit!

14:13.485 --> 14:17.988
You are here to have
moments of pure inspiration.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.191
And right now,
you're not even here.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.094
Come on, why don't you
tell me what's wrong?

14:24.096 --> 14:27.731
<i>Yeah, OK,
but did it seem like she was...</i>

14:27.733 --> 14:29.933
like she's
suspecting something?

14:29.935 --> 14:31.801
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
- Fuck!

14:31.803 --> 14:35.138
I think she might suspect
that I'm up to something.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.440
And they're moving forward
with the microwave towers.

14:37.442 --> 14:39.776
They're still doing
the microwave thing?

14:39.778 --> 14:41.111
Yeah.

14:41.113 --> 14:43.847
OK, but how long before
that's, like, viable?

14:43.849 --> 14:45.048
Uh, 3 years.
Tops, tops.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.884
OK, all right, 3 years.
So that's OK.

14:46.886 --> 14:51.054
You just stay focused, OK?
We get in, we make our money.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.421
In, like, in a year or two,

14:52.423 --> 14:53.823
we get the hell
out just in time.

14:53.825 --> 14:55.591
We get you your country
home on a hill, OK?

14:55.593 --> 14:56.425
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

14:56.427 --> 14:57.761
All right, I'm heading
back to Kansas.

14:57.763 --> 14:58.762
- Wish me luck!
- OK!

14:58.764 --> 15:00.330
All right,
see you Monday, dude!

15:00.332 --> 15:02.101
Yeah! Bye!

15:55.820 --> 15:57.787
Hey! You're gonna
wake the girls up.

15:57.789 --> 15:59.622
What the fuck
are you doing?

15:59.624 --> 16:02.426
Oh, I'm just installing a
backup system for our computers.

16:02.428 --> 16:03.926
With a drill?

16:03.928 --> 16:06.595
Yeah, it's for the wires
to come out the back.

16:06.597 --> 16:08.763
- Are you OK, Anton?
- What do you mean?

16:08.765 --> 16:10.665
I mean you're
doing weird things

16:10.667 --> 16:12.134
in the middle
of the night.

16:12.136 --> 16:14.437
I'll... I'll be done
in 15 minutes.

16:14.439 --> 16:16.973
No, come to bed now!

16:16.975 --> 16:18.808
Give me 10 minutes.

16:18.810 --> 16:21.644
- I... I'll drill quietly.
- Five.

16:21.646 --> 16:24.579
If you're not in bed in five,
you're sleeping on the couch.

16:24.581 --> 16:26.451
OK, five.

17:09.993 --> 17:14.131
The Kansas servers are...

17:15.098 --> 17:16.767
right there.

17:22.005 --> 17:23.305
Very first landowner.

17:23.307 --> 17:24.306
Yeah.

17:24.308 --> 17:25.876
One of 10,000.

17:32.215 --> 17:33.848
Good morning, sir!

17:33.850 --> 17:35.850
Are you the owner
of this fine house?

17:35.852 --> 17:37.152
What's this about?

17:37.154 --> 17:39.522
A business opportunity
regarding the property.

17:39.524 --> 17:41.322
How can I help you?

17:41.324 --> 17:43.358
My name's Mark Vega.
This is my partner.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.161
We work for Cobalt Fiber Tech.
We're a networking company.

17:46.163 --> 17:48.430
We'd like to expand
our operations to this area.

17:48.432 --> 17:50.231
- You are owner of this house, correct?
- Yeah.

17:50.233 --> 17:51.698
Fantastic! I've got
some really good news...

17:51.700 --> 17:56.037
- Vega? Where are you from?
- I'm from New Jersey, sir.

17:56.039 --> 17:57.305
Originally.

17:57.307 --> 17:59.873
I'm Hispanic.
Where are you from, sir?

17:59.875 --> 18:02.209
- America.
- Where are you from originally?

18:02.211 --> 18:03.877
OK! Vincent Zaleski.
I'm American.

18:03.879 --> 18:06.381
We're looking to stretch
our lines of communication.

18:06.383 --> 18:09.451
I'm in charge of figuring out
who'd sell us a stretch of land.

18:09.453 --> 18:11.419
- I ain't selling my land.
- Of course not!

18:11.421 --> 18:13.855
We're looking for access
to a thin strip of your land

18:13.857 --> 18:14.988
to spread our line.

18:14.990 --> 18:17.024
- A very, very thin strip.
- How thin?

18:17.026 --> 18:20.294
Well, it's about this wide
for the length of your property.

18:20.296 --> 18:22.297
We would start at about,

18:22.299 --> 18:24.164
uh, well, start about here,

18:24.166 --> 18:28.002
and it would go underground
really deep, like, 10 feet,

18:28.004 --> 18:29.437
all the way under your land

18:29.439 --> 18:31.340
to about that, like,
pole over there.

18:32.842 --> 18:35.175
You wanna buy a 12" strip
off of my property?

18:35.177 --> 18:38.312
Well, under your property.
And it's just to put a line in.

18:38.314 --> 18:40.247
We'd bring a
horizontal drilling machine.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.249
It would sit right
on that street...

18:42.251 --> 18:44.017
I think it would
impress the neighbors...

18:44.019 --> 18:47.488
and drill underneath your lot
the entire way, nothing broken,

18:47.490 --> 18:48.654
nothing torn out.

18:48.656 --> 18:49.957
It would be
completely invisible.

18:49.959 --> 18:51.825
We could even do, like,
a lease if you want,

18:51.827 --> 18:53.360
like, a 10-year lease.

18:53.362 --> 18:55.129
It's basically like free money.

18:55.131 --> 18:57.464
Ain't no free money,
my friend. Money is money.

18:57.466 --> 19:00.302
That's very true, sir.
That's very true.

19:01.670 --> 19:03.870
You got all this
written down somewhere?

19:03.872 --> 19:05.439
Yes, I do!

19:05.441 --> 19:08.477
I... do!

19:14.083 --> 19:16.416
<i>Anybody that can do this right</i>

19:16.418 --> 19:17.951
is already working for me.

19:17.953 --> 19:20.753
I have been recruiting them
and training them for years.

19:20.755 --> 19:22.289
That's why we're the fastest.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.492
Can you run it all by me
one more time, please?

19:25.494 --> 19:26.759
Sure!

19:26.761 --> 19:30.597
So, there's this
vast universe

19:30.599 --> 19:33.133
with all these
orders flying around.

19:33.135 --> 19:35.569
We identify
the big buyers,

19:35.571 --> 19:38.838
then we figure out what are
they buying and at what price.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.107
We use our speed
to jump over them

19:41.109 --> 19:43.610
all the way to
the front of the line.

19:43.612 --> 19:46.580
Hi! Hi, we have
these notes for Miss Torres.

19:46.582 --> 19:48.081
If you can give those to her...

19:48.083 --> 19:49.715
If you could you just sign this,

19:49.717 --> 19:51.384
confirming you've
received them...

19:51.386 --> 19:53.920
What you do sounds like
what a scalper does.

19:53.922 --> 19:56.923
What we do is nanosecond
financial engineering.

19:56.925 --> 20:00.826
It's light years away from
scalping and much sexier.

20:00.828 --> 20:01.994
How do we get into

20:01.996 --> 20:04.131
your nanosecond
financial engineering?

20:04.133 --> 20:06.099
It's been a pleasure
working with you.

20:06.101 --> 20:07.200
Come on!

20:07.202 --> 20:09.202
- What kind of clients...
- You know what?

20:09.204 --> 20:11.437
I am going to have to
step out for a second.

20:11.439 --> 20:13.873
- But, Jenny, take it over.
- Um, so...

20:13.875 --> 20:15.542
What was that?

20:15.544 --> 20:16.577
I don't know.

20:25.687 --> 20:27.687
All right, tell me
your dream, buddy.

20:27.689 --> 20:30.256
Country home on a hill,
small road, hummingbirds.

20:30.258 --> 20:31.624
All right,
say it again.

20:31.626 --> 20:34.193
Country home on a hill,
small road, hummingbirds.

20:35.598 --> 20:38.299
Just keep moving.
You're doing the right thing.

20:39.434 --> 20:40.765
Hey! Hey! Hey!

20:40.767 --> 20:42.801
- Oh, shit!
- What are you doing?

20:42.803 --> 20:44.704
Wait! What is this?

20:44.706 --> 20:46.272
That's our resignation.

20:46.274 --> 20:47.772
Thank you for
our employment.

20:47.774 --> 20:49.008
Are you kidding me?

20:49.010 --> 20:50.409
No, I'm not. Let's go.

20:50.411 --> 20:52.845
Because I don't know
where you think you're going,

20:52.847 --> 20:54.681
but you're going
empty-handed.

20:54.683 --> 20:55.814
You realize
that, right?

20:55.816 --> 20:57.249
All the information, the data,

20:57.251 --> 20:59.452
research, obviously,
my codes, they stay here.

20:59.454 --> 21:01.987
Your codes? Sorry,
they're his codes.

21:01.989 --> 21:03.689
His codes?
You're delusional!

21:03.691 --> 21:04.756
You're delusional!

21:04.758 --> 21:07.393
Everything in that head,
it's ours!

21:07.395 --> 21:09.095
It's his. This is
a free country.

21:09.097 --> 21:11.596
That part of his brain
belongs to us!

21:11.598 --> 21:12.665
No, free country!

21:12.667 --> 21:15.100
Do you even know
why you're doing this?

21:15.102 --> 21:19.070
Because I know that this stupid
idea cannot possibly be yours.

21:19.072 --> 21:21.474
OK, you got the letters.
It's done, we're out.

21:21.476 --> 21:25.244
I even hired you this
despicable <i>pedazo de mierda</i>

21:25.246 --> 21:26.579
so you could have a pet.

21:26.581 --> 21:28.813
- Oh!
- I need bigger challenges.

21:28.815 --> 21:30.448
Why?

21:30.450 --> 21:32.217
I'm sick of just
patching things up

21:32.219 --> 21:34.587
and fixing small, tedious
problems on your line.

21:34.589 --> 21:36.888
It's a shitty design
in the first place.

21:36.890 --> 21:39.924
- Yeah, it's a shitty design.
- Is this some kind of tantrum?

21:39.926 --> 21:41.826
We are on to bigger
and better things.

21:41.828 --> 21:44.129
- I don't understand!
- Thank you, shitty design!

21:44.131 --> 21:45.597
I know that we can

21:45.599 --> 21:48.867
just break the walls
of perception together!

21:48.869 --> 21:51.671
What the hell does that mean?
Come on, let's go!

21:51.673 --> 21:54.205
- Anton! Anton!
- That's fucking creepy! Let's go.

21:54.207 --> 21:56.141
You're about to cross
a very thin line,

21:56.143 --> 21:57.208
and you will regret it.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.710
Ugh!

21:58.712 --> 22:01.279
I'll give you one second
to snap out of it.

22:01.281 --> 22:02.683
Come back to me.

22:06.787 --> 22:08.953
<i>Eres un pendejo,</i> Vincent!

22:08.955 --> 22:10.822
Oh! Thanks for everything!

22:17.963 --> 22:18.962
Yo! Amy!

22:18.964 --> 22:20.030
Hey! How'd it go?

22:20.032 --> 22:20.998
Amazing!

22:21.000 --> 22:22.500
I signed 11 miles of houses

22:22.502 --> 22:25.170
from the Kansas servers
heading towards Independence.

22:25.172 --> 22:26.137
- Awesome!
- Yeah.

22:26.139 --> 22:27.539
What's this?

22:27.541 --> 22:30.308
All landowners from
Arrow Rock to Martinsburg.

22:30.310 --> 22:31.643
You signed everybody?

22:31.645 --> 22:32.644
Yeah, baby.

22:32.646 --> 22:33.745
Beautiful, brother!

22:50.630 --> 22:52.630
You will recognize
that a breach...

22:58.839 --> 23:01.071
All right, please sign here.

23:54.493 --> 23:55.958
Hi, Bryan.
How are you?

23:55.960 --> 23:56.926
Ah!

23:56.928 --> 23:59.095
I brought you
our secret weapon.

23:59.097 --> 24:00.930
Great! Good to
see you, Vincent!

24:00.932 --> 24:02.966
It's great to see you.
Here's my cousin.

24:02.968 --> 24:05.436
- Finally, you guys are meeting.
- Nice to meet you.

24:05.438 --> 24:07.704
Two of my favorite
people in the same room.

24:07.706 --> 24:09.606
- Let's get down to it.
- Absolutely!

24:09.608 --> 24:11.941
- Take it from the top.
- This is the state of affairs.

24:11.943 --> 24:15.011
We have deals with 54 crews,
working on the line.

24:15.013 --> 24:17.247
We have land deals
with about 95% of the...

24:17.249 --> 24:20.083
Anton? You wanna come
be part of the meeting?

24:20.085 --> 24:24.120
We have land deals with 95% of
the people we need to sign with.

24:24.122 --> 24:26.723
And we have
headquarters

24:26.725 --> 24:29.125
here, here, here and here.

24:29.127 --> 24:31.227
And this is where
I'll be most of the time.

24:31.229 --> 24:32.930
This is protected forest.
There's no roads.

24:32.932 --> 24:34.465
There's no construction allowed.

24:34.467 --> 24:37.099
Basically, we got rivers to
cross, swamps, you name it.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.568
What's this dotted line?

24:38.570 --> 24:40.570
This is actually
our problem area.

24:40.572 --> 24:42.805
This is the Appalachians,
a big national park.

24:42.807 --> 24:44.040
It's a granite mountain

24:44.042 --> 24:45.975
that we have to find
a way to dig through.

24:45.977 --> 24:48.177
It's protected by the State.
There's no roads.

24:48.179 --> 24:49.847
Well, how much
time are we losing

24:49.849 --> 24:51.113
to go around the mountain?

24:51.115 --> 24:52.816
Anton, take them
through how long

24:52.818 --> 24:54.784
this whole
thing's gonna take.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.352
- Yeah.
- OK, great.

24:56.354 --> 24:58.821
Uh, so, Kansas City
to Indiana,

24:58.823 --> 25:00.690
just north of Minneapolis,

25:00.692 --> 25:02.358
is 2.3 milliseconds.

25:02.360 --> 25:05.963
Indianapolis to
the Appalachians is 2.5.

25:05.965 --> 25:10.833
Then, um, Appalachians to the
New York Stock Exchange is 4.3.

25:10.835 --> 25:12.835
If we go around
the mountain in 3.2,

25:12.837 --> 25:14.337
if we go totally straight,

25:14.339 --> 25:16.472
and then plus 0.5
for processing.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.474
So, for the round trip,

25:18.476 --> 25:20.409
it's 19.2 if we go
around the mountains

25:20.411 --> 25:21.410
and 17 if we...

25:21.412 --> 25:22.678
No, it's 16!
It's not 17.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.280
- It's 17 for...
- Anton, what? No!

25:24.282 --> 25:26.449
- Vinnie, you said 16, not 17.
- I know.

25:26.451 --> 25:27.683
- 17 is useless.
- I know.

25:27.685 --> 25:29.685
There's probably
dozens of market makers

25:29.687 --> 25:31.687
that'll be under 17
in year or two.

25:31.689 --> 25:32.722
Listen to me.

25:32.724 --> 25:34.490
There is no way
that we can go public

25:34.492 --> 25:35.825
with 17 milliseconds.

25:35.827 --> 25:38.127
He means we're at 17
with our beta software.

25:38.129 --> 25:41.063
- No, this is...
- Please don't scare our friends to death.

25:41.065 --> 25:42.265
We'll get it down to 16

25:42.267 --> 25:44.232
when he strips the code,
which he will do.

25:44.234 --> 25:46.301
You're right,
we have to go straight through.

25:46.303 --> 25:49.337
We can't go around.
We're losing too much speed.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.507
- You scared the shit out of us.
- Did I?

25:51.509 --> 25:53.009
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry about that.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.211
How are you getting
through the mountain?

25:55.213 --> 25:56.612
Two things need
to get done.

25:56.614 --> 25:58.046
We need government clearance
to get our crew in,

25:58.048 --> 26:00.282
and we need to find a way
to bring our gear in.

26:00.284 --> 26:02.885
- Clearance is easy.
- Is it? Wow!

26:02.887 --> 26:05.755
Well, if it's easy for you,
it's good for us. Thank you.

26:05.757 --> 26:07.757
Give me a couple days.
I'll get on it.

26:07.759 --> 26:09.692
Yes, that's great! OK!

26:09.694 --> 26:11.027
- Fantastic!
- All right.

26:11.029 --> 26:12.795
Well, we will be on our way.

26:12.797 --> 26:15.764
I will say I'm really enjoying
working with you guys,

26:15.766 --> 26:18.099
and I think this is
actually a lot of fun.

26:18.101 --> 26:19.534
And if you'll excuse us,

26:19.536 --> 26:22.504
we have a tunnel to dig
from New York to Kansas.

26:22.506 --> 26:25.173
Mr. Simon, we never really...
but we should!

26:25.175 --> 26:27.877
- You go to Kansas now, Dorothy!
- It's Anton.

26:27.879 --> 26:29.545
All right.
Let's go, Anton.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.278
Anton. All right.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.281
How am I supposed
to design a software

26:33.283 --> 26:34.649
that's a millisecond faster

26:34.651 --> 26:37.085
when I already tore everything
I could off the code?

26:37.087 --> 26:38.753
I don't know,
maybe you just need

26:38.755 --> 26:40.088
to take your
time and relax.

26:40.090 --> 26:41.790
It's not about
time, Vinnie!

26:41.792 --> 26:42.792
OK, all right.

26:42.794 --> 26:43.826
It cannot be done!

26:43.828 --> 26:45.027
All right, man!

26:45.029 --> 26:46.863
- You're not listening to me!
- OK, OK!

26:48.264 --> 26:49.898
Listen to me!
Listen to me, though!

26:49.900 --> 26:53.034
You need to find a millisecond,
OK, or we do not have a purpose.

26:53.036 --> 26:55.539
Our whole project becomes
useless. Do you want that?

26:59.743 --> 27:04.313
Uh, we are Delta.
It's Terminal 5.

27:05.314 --> 27:07.782
Do you really need me
in Pennsylvania?

27:07.784 --> 27:09.985
- Isn't it better if I stay here?
- No.

27:09.987 --> 27:11.853
- I could focus more if...
- Absolutely not.

27:11.855 --> 27:14.856
I need you by my side, OK?
You can focus there, all right?

27:14.858 --> 27:18.027
And when you're at the airport,
please just try to relax, OK?

27:18.029 --> 27:19.293
Can you do that?

27:23.199 --> 27:26.402
It's fucking hot in here!

27:27.403 --> 27:28.803
- Excuse me!
- Yeah?

27:28.805 --> 27:30.505
Can I get some
water, please?

27:30.507 --> 27:31.775
Yeah, sure thing.

27:41.852 --> 27:43.718
Vincent! Vincent!

27:43.720 --> 27:44.853
Yeah, what?

27:44.855 --> 27:46.688
There's no life vest
under my seat.

27:46.690 --> 27:48.222
- There's no life vest under my seat?
- No.

27:48.224 --> 27:50.824
What do you need a life vest
for? We're flying to Pittsburgh.

27:50.826 --> 27:51.825
In case we
crash in water.

27:51.827 --> 27:53.260
We're not flying over water.

27:53.262 --> 27:54.828
We're flying across
Pennsylvania.

27:54.830 --> 27:56.830
There could be
a river, a lake.

27:56.832 --> 27:58.432
We're not crashing
into a river.

27:58.434 --> 27:59.500
You don't know that.

27:59.502 --> 28:01.002
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:01.004 --> 28:02.369
Everything's OK?

28:02.371 --> 28:03.504
Sorry, he's fine.

28:03.506 --> 28:05.205
He's just a little
scared of flying.

28:05.207 --> 28:06.907
I'm just a little
scared of flying.

28:06.909 --> 28:08.509
Yeah. OK, just
try to relax.

28:08.511 --> 28:09.510
Yeah.

28:09.512 --> 28:10.511
It's all all right.

28:10.513 --> 28:11.512
- Oh, it is.
- OK.

28:11.514 --> 28:13.013
That's very helpful.
Thank you.

28:13.015 --> 28:14.014
Mm-hmm! OK!

28:14.016 --> 28:15.249
- Thank you.
- OK.

28:15.251 --> 28:17.418
Could you please just try
to fall asleep maybe?

28:17.420 --> 28:19.820
Just close your eyes,
maybe try to fall asleep, OK?

28:19.822 --> 28:22.157
All right, then when you
wake up, we'll be there.

28:22.159 --> 28:24.692
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

28:24.694 --> 28:25.959
<i>I would like to welcome you</i>

28:25.961 --> 28:27.728
<i>onboard this flight
to Pittsburgh.</i>

28:28.964 --> 28:30.831
<i>Flight duration
is around 2 hours.</i>

28:30.833 --> 28:33.634
<i>We're expecting some heavy
turbulence during take-off...</i>

28:33.636 --> 28:34.635
No! No! No!

28:36.173 --> 28:37.204
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:37.206 --> 28:38.337
Stop the plane!

28:38.339 --> 28:40.174
Yes, I do, OK?
Just wait for us there.

28:40.176 --> 28:42.475
Just wait for us there.
We will be there soon.

28:42.477 --> 28:43.744
No, nothing happened.

28:43.746 --> 28:44.878
We had a little, uh...

28:44.880 --> 28:47.114
We had a little Anton
moment on the plane.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.085
We're fine now, OK?
All right.

28:52.722 --> 28:54.687
Don't worry
about it, buddy.

30:00.722 --> 30:02.587
Yeah?

30:02.589 --> 30:05.758
They're heading somewhere
between Pittsburgh and Kansas.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.926
<i>That's the KAX.</i>

30:06.928 --> 30:08.261
What?

30:08.263 --> 30:10.763
<i>Kansas Electronic Exchange.</i>

30:10.765 --> 30:14.299
Find out exactly where they're
staying and get back to me.

30:14.301 --> 30:15.702
Yep.

30:34.588 --> 30:36.923
- You OK?
- Hmm?

30:36.925 --> 30:38.124
Yeah. Where are we?

30:38.126 --> 30:40.427
We're in Pennsylvania.

30:41.428 --> 30:42.795
What kind of challenges

30:42.797 --> 30:44.797
do you face
in your line of work?

30:44.799 --> 30:46.431
Challenges?

30:46.433 --> 30:48.366
What's the worst
that can happen?

30:48.368 --> 30:50.836
Like the worst
worst thing that can happen?

30:50.838 --> 30:52.804
Hmm, I'd say positive shit.

30:53.807 --> 30:56.175
Positive shit?
What's that?

30:56.177 --> 30:57.844
All right,
I gotta do this job.

30:57.846 --> 30:59.979
I gotta get these pipes
going from municipal

30:59.981 --> 31:01.881
to these gentrified McMansions,

31:01.883 --> 31:03.815
about 30-35 of them
in a gated community,

31:03.817 --> 31:05.317
so I can get
them water, 'right?

31:05.319 --> 31:06.618
Yeah.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.620
They're located way
lower than municipal,

31:08.622 --> 31:10.388
so to get them
fresh water, no problem,

31:10.390 --> 31:12.158
'cause the water's
taken from the town

31:12.160 --> 31:13.525
down the hill
to their houses.

31:13.527 --> 31:14.793
Gravity does its job.

31:14.795 --> 31:17.129
But after these rich
folks eat their caviar

31:17.131 --> 31:18.596
and drink their wine,

31:18.598 --> 31:22.267
they've got to piss and shit
like everybody else.

31:22.269 --> 31:24.236
So you gotta get them
a 24/7 pump

31:24.238 --> 31:27.172
that pushes this doo-doo
back up the pipes,

31:27.174 --> 31:29.674
back up the hill.
where everybody else lives.

31:29.676 --> 31:32.677
That pump is called
a positive shit machine.

31:32.679 --> 31:34.346
- Really?
- Yeah. You following?

31:34.348 --> 31:35.779
Yeah. Not complicated.

31:35.781 --> 31:37.148
So, the sun is rising,

31:37.150 --> 31:39.951
we're covering great ground,
we're digging,

31:39.953 --> 31:41.786
- and then suddenly...
- What?

31:41.788 --> 31:42.787
Boom!

31:42.789 --> 31:45.223
A fucking earthquake!

31:45.225 --> 31:47.326
And, suddenly, there's a smell

31:47.328 --> 31:49.295
like we just
entered Dante's hell.

31:49.297 --> 31:52.696
And it's the pressurized
doo-doo in the tubes busted.

31:52.698 --> 31:54.865
- Oh, God!
- And it's fucking gushing!

31:54.867 --> 31:56.433
It's coming out like oil

31:56.435 --> 31:58.669
from the earth's
asshole non-stop.

31:58.671 --> 32:01.139
Five inches of
pure fucking shit!

32:01.141 --> 32:02.439
That's disgusting.

32:02.441 --> 32:04.376
And the central pump
feels the pressure,

32:04.378 --> 32:06.944
so it thinks it needs to keep
pushing harder and harder.

32:06.946 --> 32:08.412
Why didn't you turn it off?

32:08.414 --> 32:10.714
Can't turn it off. Only municipal
has access to the water system,

32:10.716 --> 32:12.416
and it's 5:00 a.m.,
and nobody's home.

32:12.418 --> 32:14.418
So, I'm looking at
this gated community

32:14.420 --> 32:16.855
literally drowning
in its own shit.

32:16.857 --> 32:19.590
The gatekeeper comes over.
He's got a few missing teeth.

32:19.592 --> 32:23.093
This old man puts his hand
on my shoulder, and he says:

32:23.095 --> 32:27.564
"You know, Mark, I've worked
for rich folks my whole life,

32:27.566 --> 32:31.769
"but deep down, I always knew
they were full of shit!"

32:31.771 --> 32:34.039
That's funny.

32:34.041 --> 32:34.738
Positive shit.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.341
Also, that was a long story.

32:43.015 --> 32:44.848
All right, guys.
I'll see ya later.

32:44.850 --> 32:46.719
- I'll see you in a bit! Bye!
- Yeah.

32:50.424 --> 32:52.424
Hey! Look at this!

32:52.426 --> 32:55.092
The, uh, presidential suite!

32:55.094 --> 32:56.794
Look, they
delivered your gear.

32:56.796 --> 32:58.295
Isn't that nice?

32:58.297 --> 33:01.432
And you got a desk there to
do your, uh, your coding.

33:01.434 --> 33:03.567
And...

33:03.569 --> 33:05.803
Look at that view!
Wow! That's incredible!

33:05.805 --> 33:08.839
So you can contemplate nature
while you do your coding.

33:08.841 --> 33:10.307
There's 3 phones.

33:10.309 --> 33:12.443
All right, well,
I will see you at dinner.

33:12.445 --> 33:13.543
Take your key.

33:13.545 --> 33:15.279
And please work on
that millisecond.

33:15.281 --> 33:17.281
All right, brother?
I know you can do it.

33:17.283 --> 33:18.581
- Yeah.
- OK!

33:49.382 --> 33:51.681
I think I found
something for the mountain.

33:51.683 --> 33:52.715
What'd you find?

33:52.717 --> 33:54.584
A friend of mine who
owns a couple of choppers

33:54.586 --> 33:58.287
says we can strap a drilling rig
to a Sikorsky S-61 helicopter.

33:58.289 --> 34:00.156
A Sikorsky helicopter?
What is that?

34:00.158 --> 34:02.525
That's basically a gigantic
motherfucking helicopter.

34:02.527 --> 34:04.627
It can lift up
to 20,000 pounds.

34:04.629 --> 34:05.628
Oh!

34:05.630 --> 34:07.331
The only thing
is we still need

34:07.333 --> 34:08.965
to get air-traffic
authorization

34:08.967 --> 34:11.137
to land it at the bottom
of the mountains.

34:19.944 --> 34:21.944
That's the thing.
It's $80,000 a day.

34:21.946 --> 34:23.679
A day?

34:23.681 --> 34:26.483
Yes. That includes
fuel and flight time.

34:26.485 --> 34:28.618
Fuck! Wow! Ooh!

34:28.620 --> 34:30.886
- What's wrong?
- No, nothing.

34:30.888 --> 34:32.922
I think they gave me
yesterday's fish.

34:32.924 --> 34:34.656
Two more things, Vinnie.

34:34.658 --> 34:36.324
We need air-traffic
authorization

34:36.327 --> 34:38.460
to land it at the
bottom of the mountain,

34:38.463 --> 34:40.464
and we still haven't
figured a way

34:40.466 --> 34:42.266
to land it
around here somewhere.

34:44.636 --> 34:46.101
What?

34:46.103 --> 34:49.237
Not "around here," OK?
Not "around here."

34:49.239 --> 34:51.474
Not around here.
Not around here.

34:51.476 --> 34:53.842
Not around here.
Not in Washika.

34:53.844 --> 34:56.646
We gotta be precise, all right?
Here, on the line.

34:56.648 --> 35:00.149
I mean, it looks like they're
building a straight fiber line

35:00.151 --> 35:02.651
between KAX and
the New York Stock Exchange.

35:02.653 --> 35:05.987
I know, Jenny.
I am looking at it.

35:05.989 --> 35:10.059
And I can't believe
I didn't see it coming,

35:10.061 --> 35:12.964
I mean, it was right there
in front of my face!

35:20.737 --> 35:23.171
I need you to make
the microwave towers work.

35:23.173 --> 35:25.774
Get me the pulse-shaping
algorithms yesterday.

35:25.776 --> 35:28.044
I already told you we can't.

35:28.046 --> 35:29.744
Oh yes, we can.

35:29.746 --> 35:32.782
We're gonna do a round trip,
Kansas-New York City,

35:32.784 --> 35:34.483
in 15 milliseconds or less.

35:34.485 --> 35:37.085
Eva, I just don't see
how you want us to do this.

35:37.087 --> 35:39.955
Give me the pulse shaping
or give me your resignation.

35:39.957 --> 35:41.890
Jenny, start looking
for other quants.

35:41.892 --> 35:45.228
I am going to start building
those towers tomorrow!

35:45.230 --> 35:47.263
- How are you?
- Good! How are you?

35:47.265 --> 35:48.697
- Welcome!
- Thank you so much!

35:48.699 --> 35:50.764
- So nice to have you.
- Nice to meet you.

35:50.766 --> 35:53.201
This is Ophelia Troller.
Vincent Zaleski.

35:53.203 --> 35:54.536
- Hi!
- Hi, Mr. Zaleski.

35:54.538 --> 35:56.638
Vincent, please.
Nice to meet you.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.508
Here's what
you need to know for now.

35:58.510 --> 36:00.142
We're digging a fiber tunnel
in this area.

36:00.144 --> 36:01.577
There's a long stretch of land

36:01.579 --> 36:03.579
that's protected
by National Parks.

36:03.581 --> 36:05.046
We heard that
you're the best,

36:05.048 --> 36:07.048
and we're looking
for someone to drill

36:07.050 --> 36:09.384
under that land
in one single stretch.

36:09.386 --> 36:12.354
OK, we're talking about,
like, 15 miles.

36:12.356 --> 36:16.258
So, you guys want 15 miles of
horizontal drilling in one go?

36:16.260 --> 36:19.261
- Mm-hmm.
- Why no connection points?

36:19.263 --> 36:22.196
It's all protected wild
forest. There's no access roads.

36:22.198 --> 36:25.133
There's no way to get
permission to build one.

36:25.135 --> 36:26.934
You have any idea
what kind of machine

36:26.936 --> 36:29.037
it takes to do
this kind of a job?

36:29.039 --> 36:31.606
I'm talking shipped from
the other side of the planet.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.508
So that's hundreds of
thousands of dollars

36:33.510 --> 36:34.609
just to get that machine here.

36:34.611 --> 36:37.145
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

36:38.814 --> 36:40.082
Yeah, good to go.

37:13.849 --> 37:15.449
<i>Hello?</i>

37:15.451 --> 37:17.686
Hi, it's me.
Yeah, my stomach is killing me.

37:17.688 --> 37:19.621
Uh, I think I need
to see a doctor.

37:19.623 --> 37:20.622
<i>What's wrong?</i>

37:20.624 --> 37:22.189
Probably just something I ate.

37:22.191 --> 37:23.258
<i>Meet me downstairs.</i>

37:23.260 --> 37:24.526
Yeah, thanks.
Oh, Mark?

37:24.528 --> 37:25.992
<i>Yeah?</i>

37:25.994 --> 37:27.294
Don't tell Anton.

37:27.296 --> 37:28.631
<i>Sure.</i>

38:21.116 --> 38:22.483
<i>Mr. Zaleski.</i>

38:22.485 --> 38:23.484
<i>Yes?</i>

38:23.486 --> 38:26.222
There's no easy way
to say this.

38:28.691 --> 38:30.225
Say what?

38:38.401 --> 38:39.700
Hey!

38:39.702 --> 38:41.468
Yo! What they say?

38:41.470 --> 38:42.869
Oh, nothing! I'm good!

38:42.871 --> 38:45.339
They kept you in there
for 6 hours for nothing?

38:45.341 --> 38:46.539
What, are they stupid?

38:46.541 --> 38:47.874
I know, sorry.

38:47.876 --> 38:50.443
They just had to run
some tests, but I'm good.

38:50.445 --> 38:53.346
Are you sure, man?
You still look a little pale.

38:53.348 --> 38:55.250
Yeah, I'm good!
Come on, let's go.

39:01.557 --> 39:03.891
You have stomach cancer.

39:06.094 --> 39:10.365
You have to undergo treatment
immediately. I'm sorry.

39:13.201 --> 39:14.768
Can I get a second opinion?

39:14.770 --> 39:18.003
You can, but with the X-rays
and the endoscopy and the MRI,

39:18.005 --> 39:20.074
it's pretty clear.

39:21.075 --> 39:23.078
I'm really sorry.

39:27.215 --> 39:30.383
Is that why I've been
having these nightmares?

39:30.385 --> 39:32.185
Nightmares?

39:32.187 --> 39:35.020
Yes, I've been having these
very strange nightmares.

39:35.022 --> 39:36.456
Is it because of the cancer?

39:36.458 --> 39:37.490
I don't know.

39:37.492 --> 39:39.625
This old man is chasing me.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.194
I don't think it's related.

39:41.196 --> 39:43.029
I don't know if
he's trying to kill me

39:43.031 --> 39:45.064
or if he's trying
to save me from something.

39:45.066 --> 39:47.700
Mr. Zaleski, please.
I'm not a psychiatrist.

39:47.702 --> 39:48.802
It's related, isn't it?

39:48.804 --> 39:51.203
<i>I'm sorry,
I can't help you.</i>

39:51.205 --> 39:52.973
<i>I don't have the training.</i>

39:54.743 --> 39:56.108
<i>How long do I have?</i>

39:56.110 --> 39:58.311
<i>You can live
a mostly productive life</i>

39:58.313 --> 39:59.712
<i>for the next year or two,</i>

39:59.714 --> 40:02.315
<i>like 90% of our patients
under your condition.</i>

40:02.317 --> 40:03.915
And then what?

40:03.917 --> 40:07.319
<i>One out of two patients
with your level of advancement</i>

40:07.321 --> 40:08.788
<i>live beyond 5 years.</i>

40:08.790 --> 40:11.123
<i>It's not a death sentence,</i>

40:11.125 --> 40:13.392
<i>but it's very serious.</i>

40:13.394 --> 40:15.360
<i>And with the right treatment,</i>

40:15.362 --> 40:18.930
<i>you could be 100% cured
in a couple of years.</i>

40:21.068 --> 40:24.569
Is there any way the treatment
can wait for a couple months?

40:24.571 --> 40:27.406
I'm just in the middle
of something very important.

40:27.408 --> 40:29.441
A lot of people
are counting on me,

40:29.443 --> 40:31.109
and I just can't fail them.

40:31.111 --> 40:32.612
No, it can't.

40:32.614 --> 40:35.082
It would seriously
put your life at risk.

41:36.209 --> 41:38.108
All right,
this one is yours.

41:38.110 --> 41:40.145
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

41:40.147 --> 41:43.483
It's great to meet you,
and we'll be in touch, OK?

42:18.818 --> 42:21.955
<i>You OK? I mean,
we haven't heard from you.</i>

42:23.322 --> 42:25.055
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

42:25.057 --> 42:26.290
<i>A little tired.</i>

42:26.292 --> 42:28.994
- <i>Well, how's work?</i>
- It's all right.

42:28.996 --> 42:31.495
<i>Look, I hope you're not
just eating crap out there.</i>

42:31.497 --> 42:33.766
You're gonna end up
with diabetes.

42:38.905 --> 42:39.904
Anton.

42:39.906 --> 42:41.006
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

42:42.275 --> 42:44.475
Here talk to your daughter.
She misses you.

42:44.477 --> 42:45.976
Katia!

42:45.978 --> 42:47.043
Who is it?

42:47.045 --> 42:48.044
It's your father.

42:48.046 --> 42:49.880
Hi, Dad!

42:49.882 --> 42:51.047
Hi, Katia.

42:51.049 --> 42:52.550
<i>What are you doing?</i>

42:52.552 --> 42:53.851
Ah, just working.

42:53.853 --> 42:56.152
<i>OK, I got a new book.
It's about atoms.</i>

42:56.154 --> 42:57.454
Yeah?

42:57.456 --> 42:59.189
Do you know how
much empty space

42:59.191 --> 43:00.658
there is in
a hydrogen atom?

43:00.660 --> 43:01.791
How many?

43:01.793 --> 43:02.993
Tell me.

43:02.995 --> 43:05.228
<i>99.99996%.</i>

43:05.230 --> 43:07.831
If the atom were the size
of the Empire State Building,

43:07.833 --> 43:11.167
the proton and its centre would
be about the size of a bee.

43:11.169 --> 43:13.102
All the rest is emptiness!

43:13.104 --> 43:14.605
<i>Pretty crazy, huh?</i>

43:14.607 --> 43:16.509
Yeah, that's pretty crazy.

43:41.633 --> 43:42.632
What's up, Ray?

43:42.634 --> 43:43.934
Good. How you doing?

43:43.936 --> 43:45.368
- Good.
- All right!

43:45.370 --> 43:46.704
You know Vincent?

43:46.706 --> 43:47.838
Hi! How are you?

43:47.840 --> 43:49.539
Mr. Zaleski!
Good, thank you. Here!

43:49.541 --> 43:51.139
Where are the cliffs?

43:51.141 --> 43:52.709
Uh, that way.

43:52.711 --> 43:54.243
Please put these on.

43:54.245 --> 43:56.579
Why do we need
such a straight line?

43:56.581 --> 43:58.314
Why can't we go
around the mountain?

43:58.316 --> 44:00.750
Come on, Ray, no questions.
It's in your contract.

44:00.752 --> 44:02.820
Contract!
What's a contract around here?

44:02.822 --> 44:04.991
Just a piece of paper
to wipe your ass with.

44:14.332 --> 44:16.132
Hello, Anton.

44:16.134 --> 44:17.900
What are you doing here?

44:17.902 --> 44:20.203
You probably think
I came here to remind you

44:20.205 --> 44:21.703
that you cannot
use my codes.

44:21.705 --> 44:24.272
Pfft! Well, I don't care
about the codes.

44:24.274 --> 44:25.875
Of course you don't.

44:25.877 --> 44:26.943
They're archaic.

44:26.945 --> 44:28.645
Hmm!

44:28.647 --> 44:33.148
Well, I just came here
to tell you a story.

44:33.150 --> 44:36.319
Have you heard
of Vladimir Smirnov?

44:36.321 --> 44:37.886
No.

44:37.888 --> 44:41.556
He rewrote some code for
the McMinster Fund 8 years ago.

44:41.558 --> 44:44.259
He gave them a 10- or
12-millisecond edge

44:44.261 --> 44:45.527
on the network.

44:45.529 --> 44:47.597
One day, he decided
to leave the firm,

44:47.599 --> 44:50.833
and he took a couple of
lines of code with him.

44:50.835 --> 44:53.702
Nothing special,
just generic code.

44:53.704 --> 44:55.871
But McMinster
didn't like it.

44:55.873 --> 44:58.740
So they threw
the FBI on Smirnov.

44:58.742 --> 45:02.377
They claimed that he was a
threat to national security,

45:02.379 --> 45:04.847
that he had stolen
some codes from them,

45:04.849 --> 45:08.820
that he was capable
of crashing the markets.

45:10.421 --> 45:12.856
He has been in jail
for the last 8 years.

45:19.998 --> 45:22.364
Vladimir didn't do
anything wrong.

45:22.366 --> 45:24.499
But it just goes to show you

45:24.501 --> 45:28.271
that someone can make your life
hell if they decide to.

45:30.140 --> 45:33.842
How old will your daughters
be in 8 years, Anton?

45:34.845 --> 45:37.347
Eight years is
a long time.

45:43.921 --> 45:48.357
I cared for you,
and you betrayed me.

45:49.693 --> 45:51.727
Now you have to pay,

45:51.729 --> 45:54.262
and I'm gonna make it painful.

46:58.061 --> 46:59.693
Yeah?

46:59.695 --> 47:01.594
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey! Stop the car!

47:01.596 --> 47:03.931
Yeah, let me
call you back.

47:03.933 --> 47:05.499
Fuck! Hey! Hey!

47:05.501 --> 47:07.735
Come back here, you bitch!

47:07.737 --> 47:11.772
Yeah, you!
Hey! Asshole!

47:11.774 --> 47:14.375
Oh, you think
you have power over us?

47:14.377 --> 47:16.178
Oh, you think you own us?

47:16.180 --> 47:19.412
Hey, come down,
you piece of shit!

47:19.414 --> 47:21.050
What the fuck?

47:23.853 --> 47:25.418
What is she doing here?

47:25.420 --> 47:26.654
Hey!

47:26.656 --> 47:27.755
Hey, you OK?

47:27.757 --> 47:28.989
Yeah.

47:28.991 --> 47:31.559
I just saw Torres'
helicopter fly out here.

47:31.561 --> 47:34.494
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really. Did you see her?

47:34.496 --> 47:36.130
Hey, look at me!
Did you see her?

47:36.132 --> 47:37.865
- Hey!
- Yeah, yeah, I saw her.

47:37.867 --> 47:39.200
You saw her?

47:39.202 --> 47:40.868
- Yeah, I just, I didn't...
- What?

47:40.870 --> 47:43.369
I didn't tell you 'cause
I didn't wanna upset you.

47:43.371 --> 47:45.639
You're not upsetting me.
What did she say to you?

47:45.641 --> 47:46.574
Nah, just some...

47:46.576 --> 47:47.908
What did she say to you?

47:47.910 --> 47:49.310
Just some stupid story.

47:49.312 --> 47:51.778
Some story? OK, look at me.
Did she threaten you?

47:51.780 --> 47:53.280
I'm not scared of her.

47:53.282 --> 47:55.082
- You don't have to be.
- No.

47:55.084 --> 47:56.749
She didn't lay
a hand on you?

47:56.751 --> 47:57.918
- Did she?
- No.

47:57.920 --> 47:59.920
Did she tell you
what she was doing?

47:59.922 --> 48:02.022
Hey! OK, just look
at me when I'm...

48:02.024 --> 48:03.389
What did she say to you?

48:03.391 --> 48:04.424
- Stop! Stop!
- OK.

48:04.426 --> 48:06.192
I'm doing everything I can

48:06.194 --> 48:07.360
to find that millisecond,

48:07.362 --> 48:09.095
so stop interrupting me!

48:09.097 --> 48:10.129
I can't focus!

48:10.131 --> 48:11.131
OK.

48:11.133 --> 48:12.899
- I can't think!
- OK, I'm not...

48:12.901 --> 48:14.237
OK?

48:15.537 --> 48:16.937
- Leave me alone!
- OK.

48:16.939 --> 48:18.072
Leave me alone!

48:18.074 --> 48:19.073
OK, OK!

48:19.075 --> 48:20.241
Get out of here!

48:20.243 --> 48:21.506
All right, all right!

48:21.508 --> 48:22.575
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48:36.325 --> 48:38.057
There it is,
right on schedule,

48:38.059 --> 48:40.260
the first of
your 34 towers.

48:40.262 --> 48:44.497
Kansas Electronic Exchange,
New York Stock Exchange.

48:44.499 --> 48:47.000
18 towers that way,
15 towers that way.

48:47.002 --> 48:48.201
Where are they digging?

48:48.203 --> 48:49.736
Vinnie and Anton's
guys are

48:49.738 --> 48:51.105
right at the bottom
of that cliff.

48:51.107 --> 48:52.906
That little patch
with less trees there

48:52.908 --> 48:54.539
in the forest
facing the cliff,

48:54.541 --> 48:55.741
that's the digging.

48:55.743 --> 48:58.610
They have over 50 crews,
12 in Pennsylvania.

48:58.612 --> 48:59.979
Shit!

48:59.981 --> 49:02.083
Get me back to New York.

49:06.922 --> 49:08.289
What the hell?

49:08.291 --> 49:10.889
What are they doing?
They... They're packing up!

49:10.891 --> 49:12.891
Wait! Stop the car.
Stop the car!

49:12.893 --> 49:14.193
Hey! Hey! Hey! Yo!

49:14.195 --> 49:16.996
Hey! What... what do
you think you're doing?

49:16.998 --> 49:18.331
We're leaving.

49:18.333 --> 49:20.667
You can't do that.
That's a breach of contract!

49:20.669 --> 49:22.869
Of course we can.
It's expensive, but we can!

49:22.871 --> 49:24.570
We owe you $30,000.
You get a check by Monday.

49:24.572 --> 49:26.238
- Excuse me.
- Why are you doing this?

49:26.240 --> 49:28.807
We got a better contract.
More pay for much less work.

49:28.809 --> 49:30.075
So, you're just leaving?

49:30.077 --> 49:31.543
Look, I got bills
to pay, OK?

49:31.545 --> 49:32.711
He has bills to pay!

49:32.713 --> 49:34.546
It's just business.
Nothing personal.

49:34.548 --> 49:36.416
Who gave you the
contract? Who was it?

49:36.418 --> 49:38.685
I signed a
non-disclosure agreement.

49:38.687 --> 49:41.153
It's Eva Torres, isn't it?
It's Eva Torres, say it!

49:41.155 --> 49:43.221
If you told her anything
about our project...

49:43.223 --> 49:44.222
Vinnie, calm down!

49:44.224 --> 49:45.857
...I will personally
fuck you up!

49:45.859 --> 49:48.227
- Careful what you wish for!
- OK! Fuck you!

49:48.229 --> 49:49.828
Have I ever mistreated you?

49:49.830 --> 49:52.864
I paid you to the moon and back!
Why the fuck are you doing this?

49:52.866 --> 49:55.001
You think she's trying
to build her own line?

49:55.003 --> 49:56.735
No, we're way too ahead
of the game for them.

49:56.737 --> 49:59.805
They're trying to screw us.

49:59.807 --> 50:01.673
What do you want me
to do with his contract?

50:01.675 --> 50:03.642
Give this contract
to somebody else,

50:03.644 --> 50:05.510
and figure out if they
stole any more of our crews.

50:05.512 --> 50:07.213
Listen to me, double
their wages if you have to,

50:07.215 --> 50:08.247
but keep them working!

50:08.249 --> 50:09.282
All right.

50:16.824 --> 50:18.325
Thank you.

50:20.294 --> 50:22.129
What are you
working on?

50:23.364 --> 50:25.831
Oh, I can't really
talk about it.

50:25.833 --> 50:27.233
Mm-hmm.

50:27.235 --> 50:30.070
Is that 'cause you're a spy
who works for the CIA?

50:31.038 --> 50:32.870
No.

50:32.872 --> 50:36.674
No, it's because Vincent says
everyone has to sign an NDA.

50:36.676 --> 50:38.310
So I can't talk about it.

50:38.312 --> 50:40.312
Hmm! Who's Vincent?

50:40.314 --> 50:43.416
Is that your boss at the CIA,
because you're a spy?

50:43.418 --> 50:44.949
I don't work for the CIA.

50:44.951 --> 50:48.286
Yeah, right! I have some
friends in the KGB.

50:48.288 --> 50:51.358
I'll go back there, call them,
tell 'em you're here.

50:52.658 --> 50:54.192
That's ridiculous!

50:54.194 --> 50:56.161
Come on, tell me!

50:56.163 --> 50:57.731
Please?

51:02.403 --> 51:03.801
Do you have a pen?

51:03.803 --> 51:05.404
"I, Barbara Lehman,

51:05.406 --> 51:08.340
"swear not to divulge
any information

51:08.342 --> 51:12.377
"related to Anton Zaleski's
professional activities."

51:14.014 --> 51:17.281
You know this is never gonna
hold up in court, right?

51:17.283 --> 51:18.484
Oh, it will.

51:21.220 --> 51:24.322
Well, I'm here to make digital
information travel faster

51:24.324 --> 51:26.324
between the Kansas
Electronic Exchange

51:26.326 --> 51:28.093
and the New York
Stock Exchange.

51:28.095 --> 51:29.627
OK.

51:29.629 --> 51:32.431
Let's say you're
an investor in Kansas,

51:32.433 --> 51:34.631
and I'm a trader
also in Kansas,

51:34.633 --> 51:36.467
and you wanna buy...

51:36.469 --> 51:39.637
Uh, I don't know,
what do you wanna buy?

51:39.639 --> 51:41.972
Um, what do I wanna buy?

51:41.974 --> 51:45.678
I would like to buy...

51:47.214 --> 51:49.146
a lemon company in, um,

51:49.148 --> 51:51.015
I don't know,
Zimbabwe.

51:51.017 --> 51:54.418
So you wanna buy shares
in a lemon company in Zimbabwe.

51:54.420 --> 51:56.053
Right.

51:56.055 --> 51:58.089
Let's say you wanna
buy 1,000 shares

51:58.091 --> 51:58.923
at a maximum
price of $10.

51:58.925 --> 52:00.257
All right,
let's do that.

52:00.259 --> 52:02.860
OK, so you put this
request in the system,

52:02.862 --> 52:05.995
and a bunch of traders can
now offer selling prices

52:05.997 --> 52:07.997
for the lemon
company in Zimbabwe.

52:07.999 --> 52:10.534
But the thing is, if all
traders use the same system

52:10.536 --> 52:12.036
and have the
same information,

52:12.038 --> 52:13.370
how do you beat the others?

52:13.372 --> 52:15.139
By having the fastest line.

52:15.141 --> 52:17.975
Once I know how much
you're willing to pay,

52:17.977 --> 52:20.811
I outrun the other traders
from Kansas to New York.

52:20.813 --> 52:23.380
I buy shares that sell
for less than $10.

52:23.382 --> 52:26.183
I race back and sell them
to you for $10.

52:26.185 --> 52:28.319
So, right now,
all this happens

52:28.321 --> 52:31.388
in about in about
17 milliseconds.

52:31.390 --> 52:32.990
Soon it'll be 16.

52:32.992 --> 52:36.360
But what's
16 milliseconds?

52:36.362 --> 52:39.129
It's one single flap
of a hummingbird's wing.

52:39.131 --> 52:41.731
OK, but then what happens?

52:41.733 --> 52:44.502
Well, that's it.
That's the whole thing.

52:44.504 --> 52:48.572
I've just made 1,000 times
one cent, so I've made 10 bucks.

52:48.574 --> 52:50.908
You're doing all of
this for 10 bucks?

52:50.910 --> 52:53.576
Well, I do 200,000
transactions like this

52:53.578 --> 52:54.577
every day.

52:54.579 --> 52:56.846
That's 200,000 times
$10 times 252.

52:56.848 --> 52:59.082
That's roughly
$500 million a year.

52:59.084 --> 53:01.284
That's a lot of money.

53:01.286 --> 53:02.685
It's like time travel.

53:02.687 --> 53:03.855
Yeah!

53:04.890 --> 53:06.723
But what about the farmers?

53:06.725 --> 53:09.259
What about' em?

53:09.261 --> 53:11.995
The lemon farmers in Zimbabwe,
what do they get out of this?

53:11.997 --> 53:13.630
The lemon farmers
aren't relevant.

53:13.632 --> 53:16.432
How can they be irrelevant?
They're growing the lemons.

53:16.434 --> 53:18.768
They're not an important
variable in the system.

53:18.770 --> 53:21.472
Mathematically, for our business
plan, they're irrelevant.

53:21.474 --> 53:24.542
I guess I wouldn't wanna be
one of those farmers in Zimbabwe

53:24.544 --> 53:27.110
who's mathematically irrelevant
to your business plan.

53:28.746 --> 53:29.878
OK, I'm sorry.

53:29.880 --> 53:32.582
I'll shut up and
I'll get back to work.

53:32.584 --> 53:34.284
No, no, no. It's...

53:34.286 --> 53:36.587
It's an interesting problem.

53:36.589 --> 53:40.223
It raises a lot of
epistemological questions.

53:40.225 --> 53:42.260
See ya, spy!

53:59.310 --> 54:00.909
What is it?

54:00.911 --> 54:02.110
It's a thesis.

54:02.112 --> 54:03.845
23-year-old kid out of NYU.

54:03.847 --> 54:05.983
I think he figured out
the pulse shaping.

54:06.984 --> 54:09.152
You did this?

54:09.154 --> 54:10.954
Uh, yeah, I guess.

54:10.956 --> 54:12.622
You can make the pulsing work?

54:12.624 --> 54:14.356
Yeah, I mean,
it's theoretical,

54:14.358 --> 54:16.827
but, yeah, I don't see
why it wouldn't work.

54:19.497 --> 54:21.065
Follow me.

54:22.066 --> 54:24.469
<i>I knew you were out there.</i>

54:25.836 --> 54:28.671
You know when you
get this sensation

54:28.673 --> 54:32.474
that there is someone that is
supposed to be in your life,

54:32.476 --> 54:35.312
but they just can't quite
find their way in?

54:36.447 --> 54:38.947
What did you think
about Jenny?

54:38.949 --> 54:41.149
She's all right, I guess.

54:41.151 --> 54:42.552
She's brilliant.

54:42.554 --> 54:45.753
They all are.
I only hire the best.

54:45.755 --> 54:49.524
I think you're gonna
feel at home with us.

54:49.526 --> 54:52.894
I'm gonna start you
at $150 000 a year.

54:52.896 --> 54:54.162
Is it all right?

54:54.164 --> 54:55.565
Thank you!

54:55.567 --> 54:58.434
I mean, this seems like a really
stimulating environment

54:58.436 --> 54:59.768
to be working in...

54:59.770 --> 55:02.471
However, if you can
make the pulse shaping work

55:02.473 --> 55:04.839
for our towers before
the end of the month,

55:04.841 --> 55:06.975
I'm gonna give you
a bonus of $300,000.

55:06.977 --> 55:09.845
I'm going to take
such good care of you

55:09.847 --> 55:13.384
as long as you prove
to be who I think you are.

55:15.019 --> 55:17.353
And as long as you're loyal.

55:23.193 --> 55:25.527
OK, so this is the area.

55:25.529 --> 55:26.962
Now, you, of course, wanna get

55:26.964 --> 55:29.298
the biggest, most expensive
digger on the planet.

55:29.300 --> 55:32.367
You want to dig along the forest
and then under the river, right?

55:32.369 --> 55:33.367
Uh-huh.

55:33.369 --> 55:35.036
You said they'd
never let you dig

55:35.038 --> 55:36.505
an access road through
the National Park.

55:36.507 --> 55:37.673
Probably right,
but you're thinking

55:37.675 --> 55:39.441
this is the only way
to get there.

55:39.443 --> 55:41.543
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it's not.

55:41.545 --> 55:44.112
Look, you have
9 little rivers here.

55:44.114 --> 55:46.348
OK, if I give you
4 mini-diggers,

55:46.350 --> 55:48.649
I put them on rafts
and rack 'em along the rivers

55:48.651 --> 55:51.052
and have them all
working at the same time,

55:51.054 --> 55:53.487
pretty sure that,
for half your budget,

55:53.489 --> 55:55.990
I can get the job
done 4 times as fast.

55:55.992 --> 55:59.528
On the phone you said
twice as fast, not four times.

55:59.530 --> 56:02.633
Yeah, well,
you know, Murphy's law.

56:03.634 --> 56:05.168
I'm a pessimist.

56:09.172 --> 56:11.339
I wanna come on the raft.

56:11.341 --> 56:13.809
Well, I hope you brought
your winter jacket,

56:13.811 --> 56:16.112
'cause it just
snowed up there.

56:31.594 --> 56:34.261
Yeah, my father
would've liked it here.

56:34.263 --> 56:36.263
My parents were born in Russia.

56:36.265 --> 56:38.599
Yeah, they moved here
in the '60s,

56:38.601 --> 56:41.802
moved into a tiny apartment
with 10 other Russian families.

56:41.804 --> 56:43.337
Two weeks after he got here,

56:43.339 --> 56:45.473
these police came,
knocked on his door,

56:45.475 --> 56:47.375
threw him in
the back of the car,

56:47.377 --> 56:49.410
thought we was a spy,
which he wasn't.

56:49.412 --> 56:52.313
They interrogated him for,
like, 4 weeks or something.

56:52.315 --> 56:54.114
He never saw the
light of the day.

56:54.116 --> 56:55.649
- That's insane!
- Yeah!

56:55.651 --> 56:58.853
My mother said he became like
a totally different person.

56:58.855 --> 57:00.621
He became, like, angry.

57:00.623 --> 57:03.791
Yeah, and I was born a
few years later, so lucky!

57:03.793 --> 57:04.792
Yeah.

57:04.794 --> 57:06.560
He always told me
the same thing.

57:06.562 --> 57:07.995
He said:
"Whatever you do,

57:07.997 --> 57:10.563
"make sure you own
your freedom."

57:10.565 --> 57:12.165
Own your freedom?

57:12.167 --> 57:14.702
Doesn't that kind of defeat
the purpose of freedom?

57:14.704 --> 57:15.803
Yeah, maybe.

57:15.805 --> 57:18.104
And he was always trying to,

57:18.106 --> 57:22.278
like, scare me or something
into being, like...

57:23.513 --> 57:26.012
I don't know,
like, successful.

57:26.014 --> 57:29.786
So, you think you're doing
this to prove your father wrong?

57:31.286 --> 57:33.587
Wrong about what?

57:33.589 --> 57:35.155
About being
successful.

57:35.157 --> 57:38.428
It's a pretty crazy project
you got going here.

57:41.061 --> 57:45.133
It's just... it's just
something I need to do.

57:50.172 --> 57:51.707
We're here.

58:16.798 --> 58:18.298
That's incredible!

58:18.300 --> 58:20.333
- That's amazing!
- Yeah?

58:20.335 --> 58:22.302
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

58:22.304 --> 58:23.703
Listen, I have
a bunch of work

58:23.705 --> 58:25.472
that I still have
to finish up here,

58:25.474 --> 58:26.807
but Pete'll
take you back.

58:26.809 --> 58:28.574
He's waiting for you
on the other side.

58:28.576 --> 58:29.575
- OK.
- All right?

58:29.577 --> 58:30.577
Thank you.

58:30.579 --> 58:33.347
And, uh,
I hope you make it.

59:13.855 --> 59:15.288
No housekeeping!

59:21.161 --> 59:23.295
Anton!

59:23.297 --> 59:25.232
Anton, it's me.
Open up.

59:27.769 --> 59:28.835
Yo, Anton!

59:28.837 --> 59:29.869
Yeah, I'm coming.

59:29.871 --> 59:30.870
Hi!

59:30.872 --> 59:32.039
Hi! Thanks.

59:33.039 --> 59:34.339
Oh!

59:34.341 --> 59:35.641
All right,
so, good news.

59:35.643 --> 59:37.709
We got 600 miles of
the line completed,

59:37.711 --> 59:40.946
and the helicopter flies to
the cliffs today, which is good.

59:40.948 --> 59:41.948
How about you?

59:41.950 --> 59:44.951
How are you doing?
Where are we at?

59:44.953 --> 59:47.286
I only cut a 10th
of a millisecond off.

59:47.288 --> 59:49.788
A 10th of a millisecond,
that's not bad!

59:49.790 --> 59:51.790
That's a start!
It's a good start!

59:51.792 --> 59:53.190
Oh!

59:53.192 --> 59:56.295
You OK? Hey!

59:56.297 --> 59:58.832
Come on!
Dude, what's going on?

01:00:00.334 --> 01:00:02.801
Well, the system's
missing some variables.

01:00:02.803 --> 01:00:05.069
OK. Well, whatever it is,
we can fix it.

01:00:05.071 --> 01:00:06.504
We'll fix it.

01:00:06.506 --> 01:00:08.139
There's granularity issues.

01:00:08.141 --> 01:00:10.576
Well, what is that?
I don't know what that is.

01:00:10.578 --> 01:00:11.910
The lemon farmers.

01:00:11.912 --> 01:00:14.346
The core economic units
don't have enough resources.

01:00:14.348 --> 01:00:15.614
OK.

01:00:15.616 --> 01:00:18.317
It's all gonna collapse
in about 50 years,

01:00:18.319 --> 01:00:21.754
unless we get the algos
to factor in the lemons.

01:00:22.755 --> 01:00:24.488
OK, you know what?

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:25.924
There's bugs
in the system.

01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:28.660
You and me are going on
a little road trip, all right?

01:00:28.662 --> 01:00:31.730
Gonna get your mind off coding
for a few hours or a few days.

01:00:31.732 --> 01:00:33.097
I gotta finish this.

01:00:33.099 --> 01:00:34.466
Hey! I'm not asking, buddy.

01:00:34.468 --> 01:00:36.168
Come on, let's go
see the helicopter!

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:38.569
Change your clothes.
We'll get you some fresh air.

01:00:38.571 --> 01:00:39.570
Anton!

01:00:40.907 --> 01:00:43.107
Um, I have a question

01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:47.478
regarding a fiber connector,
model 2MMTR5547.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.380
<i>OK, what's the question?</i>

01:00:49.382 --> 01:00:51.483
Is the dissipation
index accurate,

01:00:51.485 --> 01:00:54.952
or could there be slight
variations in the speed loss?

01:00:54.954 --> 01:00:58.522
<i>No, sir, I don't think there
is anything significant there.</i>

01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:01.292
Is there any tolerance,
like even 0.1%?

01:01:01.294 --> 01:01:03.762
<i>The numbers you have
are in optimal conditions.</i>

01:01:03.764 --> 01:01:05.129
<i>If there was some difference,</i>

01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:06.765
<i>I'd say it was
the other way around.</i>

01:01:06.767 --> 01:01:09.066
<i>You might get slightly
less performance than that.</i>

01:01:09.068 --> 01:01:11.435
Well, that's pretty stupid.

01:01:11.437 --> 01:01:13.271
<i>Excuse me, sir?</i>

01:01:14.807 --> 01:01:17.408
Hey! Hey,
do you feel that?

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:18.442
Flat tire.

01:01:18.444 --> 01:01:20.344
Shit! Are you serious?

01:01:20.346 --> 01:01:21.347
Yeah.

01:01:34.627 --> 01:01:35.826
An hour?

01:01:35.828 --> 01:01:38.464
All right, all right.
Just please hurry.

01:01:52.177 --> 01:01:53.713
Hey!

01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:57.347
You think when this is over,

01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:58.915
I could take your kids out,

01:01:58.917 --> 01:02:01.418
um, like, for
ice cream or something?

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.520
Yeah, they'd really like that.

01:02:03.522 --> 01:02:04.521
Yeah?

01:02:04.523 --> 01:02:05.923
Yeah.

01:02:05.925 --> 01:02:08.161
I guess I would like to.

01:02:09.194 --> 01:02:11.263
Yeah, anytime.

01:02:26.179 --> 01:02:27.611
Vincent!

01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:28.611
Yeah.

01:02:28.613 --> 01:02:30.747
What is it?

01:02:30.749 --> 01:02:32.248
It's a frog.

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:34.286
That's cute.
Yeah, it's good.

01:02:36.955 --> 01:02:38.655
OK. Oh!

01:02:38.657 --> 01:02:40.623
Go in the water.
There, that's better.

01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:41.624
It's OK?

01:02:41.626 --> 01:02:43.259
He's fine.
It's just a... Yeah.

01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:44.460
You know, pretty soon,

01:02:44.462 --> 01:02:47.063
when you got your
country home on the hill,

01:02:47.065 --> 01:02:50.133
you could just hang out and
do shit like this all the time.

01:02:51.503 --> 01:02:53.636
It's not really
about the home.

01:02:53.638 --> 01:02:56.040
It's about people
leaving me alone.

01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:57.607
Most people are morons.

01:02:57.609 --> 01:02:59.009
Yeah?

01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:01.144
I just wanna get
a place somewhere quiet,

01:03:01.146 --> 01:03:03.312
where I can work on my codes,

01:03:03.314 --> 01:03:04.848
type some algos...

01:03:04.850 --> 01:03:06.149
Mm-hmm.

01:03:06.151 --> 01:03:09.519
...hang out with
Masha and the girls and you.

01:03:09.521 --> 01:03:13.556
We can go swim in a lake
and watch the sunset.

01:03:13.558 --> 01:03:16.192
Whatever the people
do in the country.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.763
Not bad!

01:03:20.765 --> 01:03:21.765
That was three!

01:03:21.767 --> 01:03:23.332
Yeah. Oh!

01:03:23.334 --> 01:03:24.366
Ah!

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.836
Hey! Yo, yo!

01:03:26.838 --> 01:03:28.471
Hey!

01:03:28.473 --> 01:03:29.973
All right, let's go.

01:03:34.712 --> 01:03:37.013
OK, guys, hurry!
Put these on!

01:03:37.015 --> 01:03:38.280
- Hey!
- How's it going?

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:39.748
Sorry about that.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.184
No worries.
Put the helmet.

01:03:41.186 --> 01:03:43.019
Here, goggles first
and then helmet.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:50.027
Whoo!

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:52.361
OK!

01:03:54.232 --> 01:03:55.633
Whoo!

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:59.068
Holy shit!

01:04:03.809 --> 01:04:05.908
Stand clear for delivery.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:08.844
Stand back.
Watch out for that ledge.

01:04:12.383 --> 01:04:13.682
Whoo!

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.020
Hold on!

01:04:20.025 --> 01:04:22.456
Good, good!
All right, all right!

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:29.031
Keep it coming!

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.210
Back it up, back it up!

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:56.858
Watch it! Good!
Looks good!

01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:59.562
Toss me that torque wrench!

01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:15.877
Tommy, keep the water coming!

01:05:15.879 --> 01:05:17.179
Keep the water coming!

01:05:17.181 --> 01:05:19.181
I am!

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:23.417
- Hey! Turn it off!
- Whoa, whoa!

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:24.919
Shut it down! Shut it down!

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.590
Hey! Hey!
Stop it! Stop it!

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:30.558
All right!

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.792
Back up, come on!

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.728
- Shit!
- Ray! What happened?

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:34.997
It's the rock.

01:05:34.999 --> 01:05:37.332
- Broke the drill bit.
- How did that happen?

01:05:37.334 --> 01:05:39.533
Sounds like a dyke
probably hit a vein.

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:40.835
We need a carbide head.

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:42.236
We have to get it from Norway.

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:43.871
- It'll cost 60 grand.
- You got it.

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:46.375
It's gonna take us way
longer to do this.

01:05:46.377 --> 01:05:47.808
Whatever it is,
you have to find

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.076
a way through
that mountain.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:51.779
Don't tell me that it'll cost
more, because I have no more.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.781
Take it easy!
I couldn't predict this.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.183
This is part of the game!
It's full of surprises.

01:05:56.185 --> 01:05:58.451
Read your contract.
Surprises are on your side.

01:05:58.453 --> 01:06:00.054
- That's bullshit!
- Calm down!

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:01.355
I don't know what to say.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:02.924
It's on paper.
You're responsible.

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:05.026
We're busting our asses!
I don't need this!

01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:07.762
What happened? Why didn't they
use the carbide to begin with?

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:08.763
Don't get
in his face!

01:06:08.765 --> 01:06:10.431
I thought you were
ahead of the game!

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:11.899
We are!
We hit a vein!

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:13.900
These things happen.
Relax! We'll solve it.

01:06:13.902 --> 01:06:15.568
Stop telling me that.
I'm relaxed.

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:17.671
Not with the money
I'm paying. Where's Anton?

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:18.873
Anton's up there.
Get some rest.

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:20.440
What are you doing up there?

01:06:20.442 --> 01:06:21.909
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:24.547
- Just get some rest, OK?
- All right.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:28.581
- I'm serious!
- You too.

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:30.951
<i>Uh, there have been
a couple of delays.</i>

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:32.452
The drilling in the mountain

01:06:32.454 --> 01:06:34.487
has been a pain in
the ass, literally.

01:06:34.489 --> 01:06:35.689
Does that change
our calendar?

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:38.225
Are we still gonna be able
to use the line next month?

01:06:38.227 --> 01:06:41.130
At this point,
I'm... I'm not sure about that.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.932
You know, sometimes
I wonder, Vinnie.

01:06:45.934 --> 01:06:48.835
Do you really know
what you're doing?

01:06:50.406 --> 01:06:53.807
I mean, you asked us to invest
in this crazy project of yours,

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:57.211
and then it's been nothing but
surprises since the beginning.

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:59.714
No, there hasn't.
There's been one surprise.

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:02.182
I think you might be
in over your head.

01:07:02.184 --> 01:07:04.418
I think we might be
in over our heads.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.519
Jesus! Bryan,
I'm on top of everything.

01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:09.656
It's just been a little harder
in that one spot, that's all.

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:11.359
It's a lot of money
we're about to send you.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:13.160
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Simon.
I know that.

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:15.729
Are you being
100% honest with us?

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.966
All right, like,
I'm not gonna bullshit you, OK?

01:07:19.968 --> 01:07:22.135
The line might not be
100% operational

01:07:22.137 --> 01:07:23.503
in the next month, OK?

01:07:23.505 --> 01:07:26.673
But I think that once we can
prove our line is the fastest,

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.310
the amount of money that people
will be willing to spend

01:07:29.312 --> 01:07:30.777
to get access to our line

01:07:30.779 --> 01:07:33.179
will skyrocket to the
stratosphere in a microsecond.

01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:35.015
Personally, I wanna
be there when it happens.

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:37.516
But I can't go forward without
the next payment, all right?

01:07:37.518 --> 01:07:40.020
I got a drill that
costs $80,000 a day.

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:41.454
I got a fucking Sikorsky
that's 70 feet long

01:07:41.456 --> 01:07:43.289
hovering above a
cliff in Pennsylvania.

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:44.358
- One question.
- What?

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.494
Are we getting
our money's worth?

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:48.161
Or are you trying to screw us

01:07:48.163 --> 01:07:50.863
and give yourself
a big departure bonus

01:07:50.865 --> 01:07:52.698
when the shit hits the fan?

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.832
Jesus, Bryan!

01:07:53.834 --> 01:07:55.667
You think I buried
500 miles of fiber

01:07:55.669 --> 01:07:56.535
from Kansas to Indianapolis

01:07:56.537 --> 01:07:58.705
as, what, a favor
to the Earth, OK?

01:08:00.175 --> 01:08:02.675
The line is halfway done.
It's more that halfway done.

01:08:02.677 --> 01:08:04.543
The line is gonna
be very fucking fast,

01:08:04.545 --> 01:08:06.279
and you're gonna be
very fucking rich, OK?

01:08:06.281 --> 01:08:07.982
I promise.
No asshole bonuses.

01:08:09.884 --> 01:08:12.485
Don't fuck us, Vinnie.
I trust you.

01:08:13.754 --> 01:08:16.022
I didn't spend the last
2 years doing this

01:08:16.024 --> 01:08:17.390
so I can just walk away!

01:08:17.392 --> 01:08:19.559
I'm doing this as if
it were the last thing

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.260
that I do in my life, OK?

01:08:21.261 --> 01:08:24.865
But I... I cannot go forward
without the next payment.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.738
All right, Vinnie.
All right.

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:38.176
What's the amount?

01:08:39.647 --> 01:08:42.216
$15,500,000.

01:08:45.786 --> 01:08:47.854
Check it!

01:08:59.233 --> 01:09:00.901
Thank you.

01:09:26.393 --> 01:09:27.692
Hi!

01:09:27.694 --> 01:09:29.060
Hi!

01:09:29.063 --> 01:09:30.564
How can I help you?

01:09:32.665 --> 01:09:37.169
Yeah, I just wanted to know
are all of your services legit?

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:38.537
Yeah, of course.

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.506
So this is all, like, legal.

01:09:40.508 --> 01:09:42.407
I could just get
a normal massage?

01:09:42.408 --> 01:09:43.509
Yes, sir.

01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:46.411
Would you like
a therapeutic massage

01:09:46.412 --> 01:09:48.080
or a relaxation massage?

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:50.314
Um, therapeutic.

01:09:50.317 --> 01:09:52.151
Thirty minutes
or an hour?

01:09:52.153 --> 01:09:53.888
Thirty.

01:10:58.751 --> 01:10:59.916
Oh shit!

01:10:59.918 --> 01:11:02.252
<i>Where the hell are you, man?</i>

01:11:02.254 --> 01:11:04.854
I'm in the car on my way
back to the hotel. What's up?

01:11:04.856 --> 01:11:06.856
<i>There's land that
does not belong to us.</i>

01:11:06.858 --> 01:11:09.759
- Wait, what?
- <i>We're digging on the lot, a chunk of the land...</i>

01:11:09.761 --> 01:11:12.230
I thought we had the papers.
You said it was clear.

01:11:12.232 --> 01:11:14.332
<i>The railroad guy
said they don't own it.</i>

01:11:14.334 --> 01:11:15.966
- Who?
- <i>You need to get here now...</i>

01:11:15.968 --> 01:11:18.569
Yeah, whatever, I'll meet you
there in the morning.

01:11:18.571 --> 01:11:20.036
- <i>Hurry up, please.</i>
- Yeah.

01:11:20.038 --> 01:11:21.407
Fuck!

01:11:38.023 --> 01:11:40.123
Stupid millisecond!

01:11:40.125 --> 01:11:41.594
Think you can beat me?

01:11:42.595 --> 01:11:44.161
Yeah! I'm gonna beat you.

01:11:44.163 --> 01:11:46.163
Beat you!
That's what you get.

01:11:46.165 --> 01:11:48.367
That's what you get,
motherfucker!

01:12:23.502 --> 01:12:25.000
Hello?

01:12:25.002 --> 01:12:26.802
<i>Oh, good, you're alive!</i>

01:12:26.804 --> 01:12:27.803
Oh! Hi!

01:12:27.805 --> 01:12:29.205
<i>Why haven't you called?</i>

01:12:29.207 --> 01:12:30.573
<i>It's been a week, Anton.</i>

01:12:30.575 --> 01:12:32.108
<i>Tell me what's wrong.</i>

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:33.143
Nothing!

01:12:34.546 --> 01:12:35.978
<i>This line's hurting you.</i>

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.381
<i>Don't you see
that it's hurting you?</i>

01:12:38.383 --> 01:12:41.785
<i>Why does Vinnie still need you
to be there?</i>

01:12:41.787 --> 01:12:44.487
<i>Look, the kids miss you.
I miss you.</i>

01:12:44.489 --> 01:12:45.722
I gotta go.

01:12:45.724 --> 01:12:47.590
<i>Why can't you just
work from here?</i>

01:12:47.592 --> 01:12:49.592
I gotta go.
I'll call you right back.

01:12:49.594 --> 01:12:50.593
- <i>Babe?</i>
- I'm sorry.

01:12:50.595 --> 01:12:52.029
<i>Anton! Anton!</i>

01:13:20.157 --> 01:13:21.890
Good! Good! Good!

01:13:21.892 --> 01:13:24.226
- What's up, Vinnie?
- Yo!

01:13:24.228 --> 01:13:26.897
You know what?
Wait for me here.

01:13:31.035 --> 01:13:33.202
Wonderful! Well played!

01:13:34.806 --> 01:13:37.072
Hi! Good afternoon!
Hello!

01:13:37.074 --> 01:13:38.475
Good day to you, sir.

01:13:38.477 --> 01:13:39.575
Are you with that man?

01:13:39.577 --> 01:13:41.075
Uh, yes,
that's my partner.

01:13:41.077 --> 01:13:44.213
My name is Vincent Zaleski.
I work for Cobalt Fiber Tech.

01:13:44.215 --> 01:13:47.383
We were wondering if you were
the owner of this property.

01:13:47.385 --> 01:13:50.018
Yes, we all are. We already
talked to your partner.

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.722
Right, and first of all,
I should apologize,

01:13:52.724 --> 01:13:54.456
because I wasn't there,
but I suspect

01:13:54.458 --> 01:13:57.058
he may have been a little
rude when he approached you.

01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:59.762
Yeah, so, we want to expand
our operations to this area

01:13:59.764 --> 01:14:01.129
and bring in all
sorts of new

01:14:01.131 --> 01:14:03.399
and exciting opportunities
to this community.

01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:05.701
We'd like to bring in a
high-speed fiber network.

01:14:05.703 --> 01:14:08.270
We'd like to could buy a
very narrow strip of land,

01:14:08.272 --> 01:14:09.706
not more than
one foot wide.

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:12.006
We'd come in for a week
or two and install it.

01:14:12.008 --> 01:14:14.610
We'd hide our tube
underground and leave.

01:14:14.612 --> 01:14:16.378
It wouldn't leave a trace,

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.280
and we'd compensate
you for your troubles.

01:14:18.282 --> 01:14:19.882
We're not interested,
thank you.

01:14:19.884 --> 01:14:21.617
But I'm sure our
neighbors will be.

01:14:21.619 --> 01:14:23.118
You should go
and talk to them.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.553
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry.

01:14:24.555 --> 01:14:27.922
We would be willing to
offer you $230,000

01:14:27.924 --> 01:14:29.691
for this right of way.

01:14:34.799 --> 01:14:36.365
$230,000 is
a lot of money.

01:14:36.367 --> 01:14:39.000
I'm sure our neighbors
will be very interested.

01:14:39.002 --> 01:14:40.968
Was that all you
came to talk about?

01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:44.439
Sir, I just want to make sure
that you completely understand.

01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:46.974
This line would be hidden
6 feet underground.

01:14:46.976 --> 01:14:48.409
No one would ever see it.

01:14:48.411 --> 01:14:51.212
We would come in, we would
take 2 weeks to install it,

01:14:51.214 --> 01:14:53.247
and leave you with
a check for $230,000.

01:14:53.249 --> 01:14:54.850
That much money
can go a long way

01:14:54.852 --> 01:14:57.018
to preserving your
heritage, your traditions.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:59.020
That's exactly
what I understood,

01:14:59.022 --> 01:15:00.888
and I said we're
not interested.

01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:02.557
We live simple
lives, Mr. Zaleski,

01:15:02.559 --> 01:15:03.925
at the service of God.

01:15:03.927 --> 01:15:05.560
High speed is not
our priority,

01:15:05.562 --> 01:15:07.562
and money can be
a source of conflict.

01:15:07.564 --> 01:15:09.397
Right, well,
do you think maybe

01:15:09.399 --> 01:15:11.299
you could do a
group vote on this?

01:15:11.301 --> 01:15:13.968
Please don't make
this difficult.

01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:15.937
Look, sir,
all I'm trying to do

01:15:15.939 --> 01:15:18.773
is to help bring prosperity
to this community,

01:15:18.775 --> 01:15:20.608
to make things better for you.

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:21.809
We don't believe that

01:15:21.811 --> 01:15:23.678
making things faster
makes things better.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:24.913
Mm-hmm.

01:15:24.915 --> 01:15:27.281
We believe that all
this new technology

01:15:27.283 --> 01:15:29.250
makes us more
distant and isolated.

01:15:29.252 --> 01:15:31.518
That's why we do not
want to have

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.122
your high-speed tube
under our land.

01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:36.858
So, what do we do now?

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:38.860
I don't understand.

01:15:38.862 --> 01:15:40.761
How do we find
common ground?

01:15:40.763 --> 01:15:42.163
We don't, Mr. Zaleski.

01:15:42.165 --> 01:15:44.098
We will never
find common ground.

01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.700
This is the
Lord's ground.

01:15:45.702 --> 01:15:47.567
There's nothing
common about it.

01:15:47.569 --> 01:15:50.337
We are here to take care
of it at his service.

01:15:50.339 --> 01:15:51.639
Mm-hmm.

01:15:51.641 --> 01:15:53.340
I'm sorry.
You have a nice day.

01:15:53.342 --> 01:15:55.576
- Don't be stupid, sir.
- Vincent, come on.

01:15:55.578 --> 01:15:56.978
- We're done.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:59.480
You're making a very
big mistake. Have a good day!

01:15:59.482 --> 01:16:00.982
All right. Thank you!

01:16:00.984 --> 01:16:02.717
I think I have
an idea, Vincent.

01:16:13.563 --> 01:16:16.964
<i>A historical
landmark was made yesterday</i>

01:16:16.966 --> 01:16:20.333
<i>when an Austrian skydiver broke
the supersonic barrier</i>

01:16:20.335 --> 01:16:22.369
<i>as he dived 39 km
to the ground...</i>

01:16:24.172 --> 01:16:27.274
<i>...landing safely in the
southwest of the United States.</i>

01:16:27.276 --> 01:16:29.810
<i>His pathway through
the Earth's atmosphere</i>

01:16:29.812 --> 01:16:31.278
<i>took 7 years to plan...</i>

01:16:32.649 --> 01:16:34.147
<i>Early in the morning,</i>

01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:37.182
<i>the man patiently went up
in the air in a helium balloon,</i>

01:16:37.184 --> 01:16:38.685
<i>preparing to jump...</i>

01:16:40.522 --> 01:16:42.489
<i>Hi, this is Peter from sales.</i>

01:16:42.491 --> 01:16:47.394
Hey, I need some information
on Optical Regenerator JBT145SX.

01:16:47.396 --> 01:16:49.062
<i>Yeah, how can I help you?</i>

01:16:49.064 --> 01:16:51.498
Right, so it says
"rated at 10,000 meters".

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.934
But what kind of tolerance
did you implement?

01:16:53.936 --> 01:16:56.036
<i>Uh, I don't know.</i>

01:16:56.038 --> 01:16:57.837
Ballpark?

01:16:57.839 --> 01:17:00.874
<i>Uh, ballpark,
I think our regenerators have</i>

01:17:00.876 --> 01:17:03.443
<i>around a 10% or 15% tolerance.</i>

01:17:03.445 --> 01:17:05.846
<i>Depends on what fiber
you're using.</i>

01:17:05.848 --> 01:17:09.381
Did you say 15%? 1-5?

01:17:09.383 --> 01:17:11.118
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:17:13.789 --> 01:17:16.823
So, if I have a 178
regenerators on a line,

01:17:16.825 --> 01:17:20.660
and I could do some sort of,
uh, like a selection process

01:17:20.662 --> 01:17:23.964
and only use the ones
that cover the entire 115%,

01:17:23.966 --> 01:17:29.002
I could then space them out
to one every 10.35 km.

01:17:29.004 --> 01:17:33.105
And that way,
I would... I would only need 154?

01:17:33.107 --> 01:17:34.708
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:38.144
<i>It'd be risky and expensive
to test, but why not?</i>

01:17:38.146 --> 01:17:39.678
Are you aware

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.449
that each regenerator makes
the line lose 0.02 milliseconds?

01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:47.020
24 regenerators, round trip,
that's a millisecond faster.

01:17:47.022 --> 01:17:48.755
<i>Is that a fact?</i>

01:17:48.757 --> 01:17:50.659
It is a fact.
Thank you.

01:17:54.429 --> 01:17:56.931
One millisecond faster!

01:17:58.299 --> 01:18:01.700
Who is the
motherfucking champion?

01:18:18.953 --> 01:18:21.121
Mr. Zileski!

01:18:21.123 --> 01:18:23.157
Mr. Zileski, stop!

01:18:29.195 --> 01:18:31.197
Are you Anton Zileski?

01:18:33.067 --> 01:18:34.900
Are you Anton Zileski?

01:18:34.902 --> 01:18:37.169
Yeah.

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:39.039
My name is
Santana Lopez, FBI.

01:18:39.041 --> 01:18:42.207
You're under arrest for
committing stock-market fraud

01:18:42.209 --> 01:18:44.208
by using proprietary co...

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:45.780
Mr. Zaleski!

01:19:15.542 --> 01:19:17.008
Hey, hey, hey!

01:19:17.010 --> 01:19:18.209
Hey!

01:19:18.211 --> 01:19:20.014
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.687
Come on!

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:32.724
No! No! No!

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:36.461
Excessive force!
Excessive force!

01:19:36.463 --> 01:19:38.329
As I was saying,
you are under arrest

01:19:38.331 --> 01:19:39.965
for committing
stock-market fraud.

01:19:39.967 --> 01:19:42.500
You have the right to remain
silent when questioned.

01:19:42.502 --> 01:19:44.903
Anything you say or do
may be used against you...

01:20:09.796 --> 01:20:13.131
No! Stop now!

01:20:13.133 --> 01:20:16.601
You cannot dig
under our land!

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:17.869
This is God's land!

01:20:17.871 --> 01:20:18.971
Yeah.

01:20:18.973 --> 01:20:20.670
Leave now or
I'll call the police!

01:20:20.672 --> 01:20:22.173
All right, sir,
it seems like,

01:20:22.175 --> 01:20:23.841
deep down under,
it's not your land.

01:20:23.843 --> 01:20:24.742
Of course it is!

01:20:24.744 --> 01:20:26.309
The state legislation
allows prospectors

01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:27.745
to dig at depth
under 100 feet

01:20:27.747 --> 01:20:29.213
as long as the
diggings are for

01:20:29.215 --> 01:20:30.915
the collective
wellbeing of the people

01:20:30.917 --> 01:20:32.950
and the long-term
prosperity of the States.

01:20:32.952 --> 01:20:34.919
Now, our lawyers argue
that given the fact

01:20:34.921 --> 01:20:36.453
that we're speeding
data transfer

01:20:36.455 --> 01:20:38.222
in this whole fucking area,

01:20:38.224 --> 01:20:41.291
our line is for the collective
wellbeing of the people.

01:20:41.293 --> 01:20:42.960
This place does not
belong to you.

01:20:42.962 --> 01:20:44.494
You can't put
your things here.

01:20:44.496 --> 01:20:46.230
Look down. You see
this ground here?

01:20:46.232 --> 01:20:47.932
We bought this lot.
So it's our land.

01:20:47.934 --> 01:20:49.433
We can do whatever
we want on it.

01:20:49.435 --> 01:20:50.802
Here's the good news for you.

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:52.869
I'm gonna dig 100 feet
down across your land.

01:20:52.871 --> 01:20:54.905
You're not gonna even
feel that we're there.

01:20:54.907 --> 01:20:56.007
And then back up again.

01:20:56.009 --> 01:20:57.307
He can't do this!
It's our land!

01:20:57.309 --> 01:20:58.976
As long as there's
oil or gas under there,

01:20:58.978 --> 01:20:59.911
according to the State,

01:20:59.913 --> 01:21:01.611
it belongs to anybody
below 100 feet.

01:21:01.613 --> 01:21:02.914
You understand?
Grab this.

01:21:02.916 --> 01:21:05.750
Get your people out of here,
or I'll call the fucking cops!

01:21:05.752 --> 01:21:06.719
Beat it!

01:21:10.889 --> 01:21:14.024
Most programmers have lines
like these in their computers.

01:21:14.026 --> 01:21:16.793
Well, it's not what your
previous employer says.

01:21:16.795 --> 01:21:18.695
See, she says:
"These lines of code

01:21:18.697 --> 01:21:21.331
"shorten the transaction
time by 2 microseconds.

01:21:21.333 --> 01:21:23.733
"Using them outside of
the employee's duties

01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:25.535
"is a serious
breach of contract."

01:21:25.537 --> 01:21:28.672
Um, "Miss Torres also judges
that the previous employee

01:21:28.674 --> 01:21:31.041
"should be prosecuted
under the criminal code

01:21:31.043 --> 01:21:34.312
"as his actions threaten this
country's economic stability

01:21:34.314 --> 01:21:36.214
"and therefore
should be considered

01:21:36.216 --> 01:21:37.984
"a threat to
national security."

01:21:40.118 --> 01:21:42.321
A threat to national security?

01:22:08.747 --> 01:22:10.847
Yeah.

01:22:10.849 --> 01:22:12.047
<i>Hey, Vinnie, it's me.</i>

01:22:12.049 --> 01:22:14.050
Anton! Hey!
Where... where are you?

01:22:14.052 --> 01:22:15.851
I'm... I'm in jail.

01:22:15.853 --> 01:22:17.453
<i>What?</i>

01:22:17.455 --> 01:22:21.457
Yeah, the FBI threw me on
the ground and handcuffed me.

01:22:21.459 --> 01:22:23.459
Those motherfuckers!

01:22:23.461 --> 01:22:25.128
<i>They said I could
get 10 years.</i>

01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:26.196
Can you come and get me?

01:22:26.198 --> 01:22:27.930
<i>I'm so sorry.
I should've been there.</i>

01:22:27.932 --> 01:22:29.366
<i>You did not do anything wrong!</i>

01:22:29.368 --> 01:22:31.201
<i>This is Torres.
I am so sorry!</i>

01:22:31.203 --> 01:22:32.369
This is all my fault,

01:22:32.371 --> 01:22:34.137
but I'm going to
get you out of there.

01:22:34.139 --> 01:22:36.273
Don't do anything
until the lawyers get there.

01:22:36.275 --> 01:22:37.539
I will take care of it.

01:22:37.541 --> 01:22:38.540
<i>I swear to God,</i>

01:22:38.542 --> 01:22:39.809
<i>when we get you out of there,</i>

01:22:39.811 --> 01:22:41.344
<i>Torres will wish
she was never born.</i>

01:22:41.346 --> 01:22:42.411
Yeah, yeah, OK.

01:22:42.413 --> 01:22:44.412
<i>Listen to me!
Don't do anything.</i>

01:22:44.414 --> 01:22:46.215
- Bye.
- <i>Anton? Do you hear me?</i>

01:22:46.217 --> 01:22:48.050
Amy! Amy! Hey!

01:22:48.052 --> 01:22:50.052
Listen, the FBI is on Anton.
He's in jail.

01:22:50.054 --> 01:22:51.553
- In jail? Why?
- I don't know.

01:22:51.555 --> 01:22:53.555
Get our lawyers
on this right away.

01:22:53.557 --> 01:22:54.924
We have to go down there.

01:22:54.926 --> 01:22:55.926
- Vinnie!
- Yeah?

01:22:55.928 --> 01:22:57.760
Ray says we need to
go to the cliff right now.

01:22:57.762 --> 01:22:59.427
You handle it.
I gotta go.

01:22:59.429 --> 01:23:02.898
We gotta go to the cliff
right now. Get in the car!

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:05.234
OK, OK. Amy, you call
the lawyers still.

01:23:05.236 --> 01:23:07.803
I will be back in 2 hours
to pick up Anton.

01:23:07.805 --> 01:23:09.308
- Be ready to leave!
- OK!

01:23:21.319 --> 01:23:24.053
Ray! What the hell is this?

01:23:24.055 --> 01:23:26.391
It was already there
when I got here.

01:23:28.659 --> 01:23:31.025
Eleven milliseconds.

01:23:31.027 --> 01:23:33.064
New York-Kansas.

01:23:42.472 --> 01:23:44.375
What's our
time, Vinnie?

01:23:45.444 --> 01:23:47.608
What's our
time, Vincent?

01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:49.213
Take me up there, Mark.

01:23:51.349 --> 01:23:53.349
Take me up there.

01:23:53.351 --> 01:23:54.515
Why?

01:23:59.824 --> 01:24:01.023
I don't even know...

01:24:02.526 --> 01:24:05.463
I don't know if there are
any roads up there! Do you?

01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:09.400
Dude, I don't even know
how to get up there.

01:24:19.309 --> 01:24:22.579
Are you OK?
You don't look good.

01:24:24.781 --> 01:24:27.015
Are you OK?

01:24:40.864 --> 01:24:43.131
OK, line is up.

01:24:43.133 --> 01:24:46.036
Market opens in 10 seconds.

01:24:56.446 --> 01:24:58.780
Market is open.

01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:02.850
It works.
We're the fastest.

01:25:02.852 --> 01:25:04.252
It's fucking working!

01:25:04.254 --> 01:25:05.920
Holy shit!

01:25:05.922 --> 01:25:07.587
Look at that!

01:25:09.192 --> 01:25:12.429
We just made half a million
dollars in 5 seconds.

01:25:15.265 --> 01:25:17.331
Bryan! Bryan!
We've got a problem.

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:18.332
What do you mean?

01:25:18.334 --> 01:25:19.867
A guy I know from
BR Cranes says

01:25:19.869 --> 01:25:21.069
they've been
putting up cell towers

01:25:21.071 --> 01:25:22.570
for the last couple of weeks.

01:25:22.572 --> 01:25:25.072
Kansas to New York.
Says it's for Eva Torres.

01:25:25.074 --> 01:25:27.007
Why the fuck is she putting up
cell towers?

01:25:27.009 --> 01:25:28.977
- I don't know.
- Well, find out!

01:25:40.322 --> 01:25:41.657
Fuck!

01:25:49.765 --> 01:25:52.200
Fuck, man! We're stuck!

01:25:52.202 --> 01:25:53.901
We're going back!

01:25:53.903 --> 01:25:55.902
No, no, no!
I need to go up there.

01:25:55.904 --> 01:25:57.370
- Vinnie!
- Yeah?

01:25:57.372 --> 01:25:59.873
- I'm taking you back.
- No, get me up there!

01:25:59.875 --> 01:26:01.875
Shut up! Alright!
You took it too far!

01:26:01.877 --> 01:26:04.010
Shut the fuck up
and get me up there!

01:26:04.012 --> 01:26:06.680
No! I'm not taking
any orders from you!

01:26:06.682 --> 01:26:08.418
We're going
back right now!

01:26:10.253 --> 01:26:11.853
You wanna go up there, huh?

01:26:13.088 --> 01:26:14.722
To do what?

01:26:42.352 --> 01:26:46.253
Vincent! Vincent!

01:26:46.255 --> 01:26:48.255
Vincent!

01:26:48.257 --> 01:26:51.124
I am gonna
cut you the fuck down.

01:26:51.126 --> 01:26:52.125
Vinnie!

01:26:52.127 --> 01:26:53.460
I am gonna cut you...

01:26:53.462 --> 01:26:55.195
Vincent!
What are you doing?

01:26:55.197 --> 01:26:57.364
- ...the fuck down.
- Vinnie!

01:26:57.366 --> 01:26:59.465
I am gonna cut you
the fuck down.

01:26:59.467 --> 01:27:00.467
Vincent!

01:27:00.469 --> 01:27:01.967
I am gonna cut you...

01:27:01.969 --> 01:27:03.969
What are doing, buddy?

01:27:03.971 --> 01:27:05.272
...the fuck down.

01:27:05.274 --> 01:27:07.207
Hey! Give me
the chainsaw.

01:27:07.209 --> 01:27:09.342
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:27:09.344 --> 01:27:11.111
Hey, calm down!

01:27:11.113 --> 01:27:12.212
He's up there, Mark.

01:27:12.214 --> 01:27:13.647
Who's up there?

01:27:13.649 --> 01:27:14.614
Goliath.

01:27:14.616 --> 01:27:15.881
Vincent, calm down, OK?

01:27:15.883 --> 01:27:17.750
- We have to get him down, OK?
- Who?

01:27:17.752 --> 01:27:20.520
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
We have to get him down.

01:27:20.522 --> 01:27:22.254
You're acting crazy.
Calm down.

01:27:22.256 --> 01:27:23.456
I have to get up there.

01:27:23.458 --> 01:27:25.258
I am stuffing your
mattress with money!

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.028
You will help me up there
and tear down that tower!

01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:29.529
Give me the
fucking chainsaw!

01:27:29.531 --> 01:27:30.597
- No!
- Give it to me!

01:27:30.599 --> 01:27:32.264
Vinnie, give me
the chainsaw!

01:27:33.968 --> 01:27:36.235
All right! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

01:27:36.237 --> 01:27:38.137
What the fuck
are you doing, Vinnie?

01:27:38.139 --> 01:27:40.540
Put it down!
Put the fucking chainsaw down!

01:27:40.542 --> 01:27:42.542
I'm gonna cut you
the fuck down.

01:27:42.544 --> 01:27:43.709
I'm gonna cut you.

01:27:43.711 --> 01:27:47.279
I am gonna tear you down and...

01:27:47.281 --> 01:27:49.283
Vinnie!

01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:57.258
Vinnie!

01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:28.220
Hi!

01:28:28.222 --> 01:28:31.390
What did you get
yourself into, Anton?

01:28:31.392 --> 01:28:33.659
Well, I didn't do
anything illegal.

01:28:33.661 --> 01:28:35.526
- You didn't do nothing illegal?
- No.

01:28:35.528 --> 01:28:37.462
Then why'd
they arrest you?

01:28:37.464 --> 01:28:39.700
You must've done
something wrong.

01:28:42.703 --> 01:28:45.770
Why'd you do this? Hmm?

01:28:45.772 --> 01:28:48.542
Hmm, Vinnie asked me...

01:28:49.543 --> 01:28:51.378
Vinnie?

01:28:58.084 --> 01:29:00.020
Vinnie?

01:29:27.547 --> 01:29:31.418
<i>I'm coming, Anton.
I'm coming, buddy.</i>

01:29:33.253 --> 01:29:35.255
<i>I'm gonna get you out.</i>

01:29:36.389 --> 01:29:38.492
<i>I'm gonna get you out of there.</i>

01:29:46.533 --> 01:29:47.699
Hmm?

01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:49.901
You're safe.
Everything's OK.

01:29:53.206 --> 01:29:54.472
Shhh...

01:29:54.474 --> 01:29:56.708
It's good, it's good!
Relax! Relax, Vinnie!

01:29:56.710 --> 01:29:58.509
Vinnie, just breathe.
Just breathe.

01:29:58.511 --> 01:30:01.044
We're in an ambulance on
the way to the hospital.

01:30:01.046 --> 01:30:02.246
OK, you passed out.

01:30:02.248 --> 01:30:03.847
Just relax.
Everything's fine.

01:30:03.849 --> 01:30:04.981
Where's my phone?

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:06.850
I've got your phone.
Don't worry, OK?

01:30:06.852 --> 01:30:08.019
- Give it to me.
- Why?

01:30:08.021 --> 01:30:09.020
Give me the phone.

01:30:09.022 --> 01:30:10.221
Come on,
take it easy.

01:30:10.223 --> 01:30:11.789
Mark, give me
the phone.

01:30:11.791 --> 01:30:13.392
All right.

01:30:15.628 --> 01:30:16.860
Here.

01:30:16.862 --> 01:30:18.363
Yeah, thanks.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.738
Can you un-strap
my arms, please?

01:30:30.275 --> 01:30:31.308
Yes, I'll... I'll hold.

01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:32.777
Vinnie, please
put it down.

01:30:32.779 --> 01:30:33.778
Shhh! I'm holding.

01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.846
- Put it down.
- Shhh!

01:30:34.848 --> 01:30:35.847
<i>Hello, Mr. Zaleski?</i>

01:30:35.849 --> 01:30:36.880
Ah, Mr. Gerbash!

01:30:36.882 --> 01:30:38.683
I'm just on my way
to a meeting. Sorry.

01:30:38.685 --> 01:30:40.485
I wanted to call
before I close a deal.

01:30:40.487 --> 01:30:41.686
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

01:30:41.688 --> 01:30:43.018
I have potential investors

01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:44.855
who are eager to
get in on the action.

01:30:44.857 --> 01:30:46.423
They want a guarantee
covering them

01:30:46.425 --> 01:30:47.657
against the competition.

01:30:47.659 --> 01:30:49.526
- <i>How do you mean?</i>
- They're being silly.

01:30:49.528 --> 01:30:51.261
But they want
some kind of coverage

01:30:51.263 --> 01:30:53.865
that secures their investment
until we finish the line,

01:30:53.867 --> 01:30:56.233
something that protects them
in case somebody else

01:30:56.235 --> 01:30:58.001
comes up with
a faster line before us,

01:30:58.003 --> 01:30:59.436
something for the next month.

01:30:59.438 --> 01:31:02.071
<i>I could design a hybrid
commercial risk insurance.</i>

01:31:02.073 --> 01:31:03.906
<i>I don't see how
someone can come up</i>

01:31:03.908 --> 01:31:05.675
<i>with a faster line
in the next month.</i>

01:31:05.677 --> 01:31:07.043
Mm-hmm.

01:31:07.045 --> 01:31:08.846
<i>And I heard you're about to do</i>

01:31:08.848 --> 01:31:10.981
<i>New York-Kansas
in 16 milliseconds?</i>

01:31:10.983 --> 01:31:12.850
- Yes, that's true.
- <i>That's amazing!</i>

01:31:12.852 --> 01:31:13.917
Mm-hmm!

01:31:13.919 --> 01:31:15.585
<i>I can't hear you quite well.</i>

01:31:15.587 --> 01:31:17.421
I'm going through
a tunnel right now.

01:31:17.423 --> 01:31:19.656
What would a rate on
an insurance like that be?

01:31:19.658 --> 01:31:21.725
<i>Something like
2 or 3 cents on the dollar.</i>

01:31:21.727 --> 01:31:24.528
2 or 3 cents on the dollar,
that's great, isn't it?

01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:26.730
- Sir, give me your phone.
- Five minutes.

01:31:26.732 --> 01:31:28.565
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- I'm still here.

01:31:28.567 --> 01:31:31.701
Cover expenses at 200% for the
next month, to cover our fees.

01:31:31.703 --> 01:31:33.670
<i>I'll confirm the rate
when I get it.</i>

01:31:33.672 --> 01:31:34.671
Oh, that's great.

01:31:34.673 --> 01:31:36.205
You got 10 seconds
to hang up.

01:31:36.207 --> 01:31:38.408
I'm going to my meeting.
I'll call in 3 hours.

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:40.510
Send all the paperwork
over to my office

01:31:40.512 --> 01:31:42.679
to have this done
by the end of the day.

01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:43.747
That's enough.

01:31:43.749 --> 01:31:45.917
I'm losing the
signal. Thank you!

01:31:45.919 --> 01:31:48.250
I just made a deal that,
if the company goes down,

01:31:48.252 --> 01:31:50.286
an insurance company
pays us loads of money.

01:31:50.288 --> 01:31:52.221
Get some rest.

01:31:52.223 --> 01:31:53.723
I invested
3 cents on a dollar

01:31:53.725 --> 01:31:55.958
in case somebody builds
a faster line next month.

01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:57.594
Since I know
there's a faster line,

01:31:57.596 --> 01:31:59.962
I know I'll get a dollar
for each of those 3 cents.

01:31:59.964 --> 01:32:02.098
You know what kind of
return that represents?

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.433
- I don't know, a lot?
- Yeah, a 2,300% return.

01:32:04.435 --> 01:32:05.869
For betting on my own failure.

01:32:05.871 --> 01:32:07.503
I know I'm gonna fail,
guaranteed.

01:32:07.505 --> 01:32:09.438
I'm happy for you.
You get better, OK?

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:13.209
Yeah. There is something else
I need you to do for me, Mark.

01:32:13.211 --> 01:32:14.276
What?

01:32:14.278 --> 01:32:15.879
You gotta get
Anton out of jail.

01:32:15.881 --> 01:32:17.347
I don't care how
much it costs.

01:32:17.349 --> 01:32:19.013
You just gotta get
him out of there.

01:32:19.015 --> 01:32:20.716
It's my fault.
I should be in there.

01:32:20.718 --> 01:32:22.485
I promise. I'll get
him out of jail.

01:32:22.487 --> 01:32:24.053
I'll finish the line.
Don't worry.

01:32:24.055 --> 01:32:26.055
I got it. Just get
back on your feet, OK?

01:32:26.057 --> 01:32:27.860
- You're gonna get him out?
- I swear.

01:33:25.615 --> 01:33:27.515
Wow! Wow! What the fuck?

01:33:27.517 --> 01:33:30.118
We're almost 20 milliseconds
down right now!

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.187
Jenny! We're losing millions!
We're all 20 milliseconds down.

01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:34.490
What? What?

01:33:34.492 --> 01:33:36.692
The whole network's
down 20 milliseconds.

01:33:36.694 --> 01:33:38.160
We're wondering
what happened!

01:33:38.162 --> 01:33:40.361
Well, I don't know!
What did you just do?

01:33:40.363 --> 01:33:42.031
All of a sudden,
we dropped by 20!

01:33:46.503 --> 01:33:49.537
Eva! Eva!

01:33:49.539 --> 01:33:51.239
We have a problem.

01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:53.742
Our line is 20
milliseconds slow!

01:33:53.744 --> 01:33:56.277
What do you mean,
20 milliseconds slow?

01:33:56.279 --> 01:33:59.147
It's a perfect, constant,
20-millisecond delay.

01:33:59.149 --> 01:34:01.482
It's not arbitrary.
It's a sharp chunk.

01:34:01.484 --> 01:34:03.184
Somebody rigged
our network.

01:34:13.063 --> 01:34:14.094
Hello, Anton.

01:34:14.096 --> 01:34:15.863
You're late!

01:34:15.865 --> 01:34:19.069
20 milliseconds late.

01:34:20.737 --> 01:34:24.840
Funny! That was
an interesting move.

01:34:24.842 --> 01:34:27.742
Yeah, well,
it could be worse.

01:34:27.744 --> 01:34:29.978
I only slowed you down by 20.

01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:33.548
You think we're stupid, huh?
You think we won't find it.

01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:35.516
Of course
you'll find it,

01:34:35.518 --> 01:34:38.453
if you put your mind to it,

01:34:38.455 --> 01:34:40.722
your quant's minds.

01:34:40.724 --> 01:34:45.425
Shouldn't take a genius like
Elias more than 5-6 months.

01:34:45.427 --> 01:34:47.194
Don't fuck with me, Anton.

01:34:47.196 --> 01:34:51.198
Give me back my milliseconds,
or I'll put Vincent in jail too.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:53.368
I could slow you down by 80.

01:34:53.370 --> 01:34:56.904
80 milliseconds,
that's pretty late in the game.

01:34:56.906 --> 01:34:59.172
What do you want?

01:34:59.174 --> 01:35:01.541
Drop the charges.

01:35:01.543 --> 01:35:03.777
And stay away from Vincent.

01:35:03.779 --> 01:35:07.280
You are so fucking boring!

01:35:07.282 --> 01:35:09.584
It's like there's
a part of your brain

01:35:09.586 --> 01:35:11.184
that operates like a genius,

01:35:11.186 --> 01:35:14.022
and then there's another one
that is handicapped.

01:35:14.024 --> 01:35:15.989
And this is why you needed me.

01:35:15.991 --> 01:35:18.525
This is why we were
so good together.

01:35:18.527 --> 01:35:19.893
I'll drop the charges,

01:35:19.895 --> 01:35:22.763
and I will stay away
from your cousin Vinnie.

01:35:22.765 --> 01:35:25.465
But don't you think
that you're better than me,

01:35:25.467 --> 01:35:28.603
- because we are the same...
- Dial 212-555-01...

01:35:28.605 --> 01:35:30.203
What?

01:35:30.205 --> 01:35:34.341
Dial 212-555-0114.

01:35:34.343 --> 01:35:37.010
When you hear a beep,
dial 3.

01:35:37.012 --> 01:35:38.180
That's it?

01:35:39.415 --> 01:35:40.948
Yeah, that's it.

01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:43.650
You could've made billions.

01:35:43.652 --> 01:35:45.220
It's all fake, Eva.

01:35:58.333 --> 01:36:00.001
Hi, Bryan.

01:36:00.003 --> 01:36:03.504
You're being punished
for what you did?

01:36:04.539 --> 01:36:06.539
I tried to fix it.

01:36:06.541 --> 01:36:08.374
I really did.

01:36:08.376 --> 01:36:10.811
I had the commercial
risk insurance.

01:36:10.813 --> 01:36:13.146
Gerbash was handling it,

01:36:13.148 --> 01:36:16.049
but we got it in too late.

01:36:16.051 --> 01:36:17.886
You screwed us.

01:36:20.621 --> 01:36:23.857
And now, because I trusted you,

01:36:23.859 --> 01:36:26.660
I might lose my company.

01:36:26.662 --> 01:36:28.831
I'm really sorry.

01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:45.746
<i>All right, sexy man.
You ready for this?</i>

01:36:45.748 --> 01:36:47.182
Hmm, I'm ready!

01:36:49.184 --> 01:36:53.721
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

01:37:01.429 --> 01:37:03.431
<i>Wow!</i>

01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:08.366
15.73 milliseconds. Shit!

01:37:08.368 --> 01:37:10.301
<i>We did it, buddy!</i>

01:37:10.303 --> 01:37:11.670
Yeah, we did it.

01:37:11.672 --> 01:37:13.339
<i>Isn't that amazing?</i>

01:37:13.341 --> 01:37:15.574
We're obsolete,
but we did it.

01:37:17.045 --> 01:37:19.212
<i>Well, you know,
sometimes they say:</i>

01:37:19.214 --> 01:37:20.746
<i>"It's not the destination.</i>

01:37:20.748 --> 01:37:21.747
Hmm!

01:37:21.749 --> 01:37:23.314
<i>"It's the people we meet</i>

01:37:23.316 --> 01:37:24.850
<i>"and the lessons we learn."</i>

01:37:27.155 --> 01:37:29.390
Hey! Come here!

01:37:30.992 --> 01:37:33.125
Thanks!

01:37:33.127 --> 01:37:35.463
Hey, honey!
Come here! Hey!

01:37:37.565 --> 01:37:38.898
- Hey, Vinnie.
- Hi!

01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.065
How are you?

01:37:40.067 --> 01:37:42.467
I'm good, I'm good!
I'm great, yeah.

01:37:42.469 --> 01:37:45.403
Girls, let's go out and let
your daddy with his cousin, OK?

01:37:45.405 --> 01:37:48.339
When I feel better, we're
gonna go out for some ice cream.

01:37:48.341 --> 01:37:50.042
Triple scoops.
No, quadruple scoops!

01:37:50.044 --> 01:37:51.110
Your daddy's paying.

01:37:51.112 --> 01:37:52.178
We'll get the tallest

01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:53.612
ice-cream cones in the world.

01:37:53.614 --> 01:37:54.879
We'll need popsicle sticks

01:37:54.881 --> 01:37:56.248
just to hold them together.

01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:57.549
- OK.
- OK!

01:37:57.551 --> 01:37:59.617
Should we go find
the coloring pens?

01:37:59.619 --> 01:38:01.120
- You wanna color?
- OK!

01:38:01.122 --> 01:38:03.088
OK.

01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:06.826
We lost it all.
Insurance won't pay.

01:38:08.196 --> 01:38:09.962
It doesn't matter.

01:38:20.842 --> 01:38:22.675
What's this?

01:38:22.677 --> 01:38:26.544
Oh, it's just some ideas
for neutrino messaging.

01:38:26.546 --> 01:38:28.146
Neutrino messaging?

01:38:28.148 --> 01:38:29.514
Yeah, we shoot neutrinos

01:38:29.516 --> 01:38:31.449
that are set up
to carry information,

01:38:31.451 --> 01:38:33.718
purchase orders,
for example...

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.719
Mm-hmm.

01:38:34.721 --> 01:38:36.354
...through
the Earth's crust.

01:38:36.356 --> 01:38:38.790
So we don't lose time
going around the globe,

01:38:38.792 --> 01:38:41.961
because we go straight through
it with a particle accelerator.

01:38:41.963 --> 01:38:45.196
The neutrino,
those little fuckers,

01:38:45.198 --> 01:38:47.665
they don't slow down for shit!

01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:50.235
Rock, concrete, nothing.

01:38:50.237 --> 01:38:52.338
We can get to New York

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:55.940
in something like
9 milliseconds.

01:38:55.942 --> 01:38:58.408
And we would beat
the game, Vinnie.

01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:01.748
New York-London, London-Tokyo.

01:39:03.549 --> 01:39:05.750
We would own Wall Street.

01:39:05.752 --> 01:39:09.087
But what do we do
when we own Wall Street?

01:39:09.089 --> 01:39:11.923
We burn it to the ground,

01:39:11.925 --> 01:39:14.691
and bring all
the lemon farmers,

01:39:14.693 --> 01:39:16.894
roast marshmallows
by the fire.

01:39:18.664 --> 01:39:20.031
I like that.

01:39:21.101 --> 01:39:23.870
You just gotta take me
somewhere first.

01:39:24.838 --> 01:39:26.139
All right.

01:39:34.647 --> 01:39:36.682
Wait! I think
that's him!

01:39:48.027 --> 01:39:49.626
What are you doing here?

01:39:49.628 --> 01:39:51.962
The line, it won't
bother you anymore.

01:39:51.964 --> 01:39:53.899
I can't hear you!

01:39:57.703 --> 01:39:59.005
Vinnie!

01:40:02.608 --> 01:40:04.944
Vinnie, get back in the car!

01:40:05.978 --> 01:40:07.613
Vinnie!

01:40:10.983 --> 01:40:12.818
Fuck!

01:40:44.416 --> 01:40:45.818
Ah!

01:40:59.832 --> 01:41:01.698
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.700
Do you need anything?

01:41:08.172 --> 01:41:09.905
You're sick?

01:41:09.907 --> 01:41:11.707
Oh!

01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:16.849
Why did you come back here?

01:41:18.150 --> 01:41:20.684
I wanted to tell you
that, last week,

01:41:20.686 --> 01:41:24.186
I took out the portion of
the tunnel that's under you.

01:41:24.188 --> 01:41:26.689
You don't have to worry
about the world

01:41:26.691 --> 01:41:29.226
going faster and faster
under your feet.

01:41:29.228 --> 01:41:30.293
It's out of there.

01:41:40.671 --> 01:41:43.205
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

01:41:43.207 --> 01:41:46.077
Wait here until
the rain stops falling.

01:42:11.735 --> 01:42:15.204
You know,
sometimes I wonder,

01:42:15.206 --> 01:42:18.509
if all the time that was
given to me was, like...

01:42:19.544 --> 01:42:21.813
like, 16 milliseconds...

01:42:23.381 --> 01:42:25.982
and I had no past memory...

01:42:27.518 --> 01:42:30.386
I had nothing carved
into my mind

01:42:30.388 --> 01:42:32.856
before those
16 milliseconds...

01:42:34.192 --> 01:42:35.925
and the only thing...

01:42:35.927 --> 01:42:39.363
that was left
imprinted in my brain...

01:42:40.798 --> 01:42:45.733
were the images and
the smells and the feelings

01:42:45.735 --> 01:42:48.539
of those 16 milliseconds...

01:42:50.174 --> 01:42:52.843
how do you think
I would process that?

01:42:55.712 --> 01:42:57.814
I don't know!

01:43:01.084 --> 01:43:02.719
Hmm...

01:43:07.492 --> 01:43:10.059
I think your life would
feel exactly as long

01:43:10.061 --> 01:43:11.994
as someone who lived
for 100 years.
