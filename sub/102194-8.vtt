09:57.771 --> 09:59.424
so they gave me Pitocin,

09:59.468 --> 10:01.383
and then they pushed
an epidural on me

10:01.426 --> 10:03.341
because that was their protocol
for Pitocin.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.605
And all I could do was lay
there, then came more Pitocin,

10:05.648 --> 10:07.128

to decelerate.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.651
- Warp speed after that.

to me, to my body

10:45.949 --> 10:48.343

a successful vaginal delivery

10:48.386 --> 10:52.521

10:54.828 --> 10:56.351

10:56.394 --> 10:58.962

Black and Latina mothers tend
to have less successful VBACs.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.706
