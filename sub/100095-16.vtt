00:31.805 --> 00:33.103
Hey, Hatcher.

00:33.336 --> 00:35.416
Coroner's finished with
the scatter at the tree line.

00:35.658 --> 00:37.315
Probably got another seven
or eight down there.

00:37.399 --> 00:38.507
So they're released?

00:38.602 --> 00:40.228
Yep. All yours.

00:43.865 --> 00:46.450
The feds say we're clear.
Start bringing the victims up.

00:46.534 --> 00:47.827
Take a team to the tree line

00:47.911 --> 00:49.798
and start moving 'em
to the morgue.

01:17.263 --> 01:18.828
Here's the next one,
Hatcher.

01:25.945 --> 01:27.930
Hello, Mr. Geller.

01:46.179 --> 01:47.424
- Hey.
- Hello.

01:47.509 --> 01:48.802
You must be Crystal.

01:48.887 --> 01:50.054
One and only.

01:50.223 --> 01:52.558
You look different
than your profile picture.

01:52.642 --> 01:54.454
You look the same.

01:55.024 --> 01:56.081
Better.

01:57.335 --> 01:59.626
Please.
Why don't you come in.

02:03.945 --> 02:06.071
I don't understand.
Over the phone, you said...

02:06.155 --> 02:07.970
- I know what I said.
- If you're a cop...

02:08.055 --> 02:12.142
Please, I didn't ask you here
for sex.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.670
Not like you think.

02:13.819 --> 02:16.451
It's something different.

02:16.536 --> 02:17.678
I'm leaving.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.069
Angela, sit down.

02:20.739 --> 02:22.662
How do you know
my real name?

02:22.944 --> 02:24.180
Who are you?

02:24.265 --> 02:25.974
I'm someone who knows
more about you

02:26.058 --> 02:28.248
than you might want
to believe.

02:30.491 --> 02:31.951
I know about your father.

02:32.106 --> 02:35.998
I know about the medical debt,
the collectors.

02:36.214 --> 02:37.464
I said who are you?

02:37.549 --> 02:39.217
Angela,
there is something

02:39.363 --> 02:40.488
that I would like
to tell you.

02:40.572 --> 02:41.865
Something very special

02:41.949 --> 02:44.201
that might just
change your life.

02:47.955 --> 02:49.748
Would you like
to hear about it?

02:51.965 --> 02:53.965
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE BLACKLIST*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 07  Episode 16</font>

02:54.049 --> 02:55.912
Aired on:
<font color="#00ffff">April 24, 2020</font>

02:56.275 --> 02:58.045
Episode Title:
<font color=#FFc30f>"Nyle Hatcher"</font>

03:01.427 --> 03:03.334
Already looked there.

03:04.638 --> 03:06.123
There, too.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.064
You do know I'm a private
investigator.

03:14.148 --> 03:15.655
You were made.

03:17.234 --> 03:19.569
Ilya obviously knew
you were watching him.

03:19.653 --> 03:21.030
Maybe that
wouldn't have happened

03:21.115 --> 03:22.936
if you'd been honest
about why you hired me.

03:23.021 --> 03:24.105
I was honest.

03:24.522 --> 03:27.148
I hired you to find Koslov
so I could question him.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.663
Does this look like a man
who's running from questions?

03:29.748 --> 03:31.539
He's running for his life.

03:31.725 --> 03:33.248
Now, why would he do that?

03:37.600 --> 03:39.339
They came here
to the mosque,

03:39.423 --> 03:42.258
said that some of our members
are communicating

03:42.342 --> 03:43.927
with Syrian jihadists.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.663
The FBI came?

03:45.748 --> 03:47.263
Counterterrorism
division.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.194
They wouldn't tell me
what they know.

03:49.346 --> 03:50.700
Maybe they'll tell you.

03:50.967 --> 03:52.897
He knows about
the Task Force.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.530
Does he?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.343
I wouldn't be
much of a shepherd

03:57.428 --> 03:59.991
if I didn't know the hearts
and minds of my flock.

04:00.076 --> 04:02.112
Excuse me.

04:02.545 --> 04:04.740
I'll see what I can do.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.243
Is it done?

04:08.327 --> 04:09.960
My job is to find people,

04:10.045 --> 04:11.621
not to keep them
from being found.

04:11.705 --> 04:13.850
- <i>Is it done?</i>
- It is.

04:14.013 --> 04:16.648
Wherever Koslov went,
she's never gonna find him.

04:16.733 --> 04:17.975
Good.

04:20.630 --> 04:22.966
Imam Asmal is grateful
for the help.

04:23.050 --> 04:24.311
We both are.

04:26.522 --> 04:28.640
Elizabeth knows
I'm not Ilya.

04:28.725 --> 04:30.334
I wonder
what else she knows.

04:30.557 --> 04:32.309
Perhaps you should ask her.

04:32.393 --> 04:33.998
She's waiting in the park.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.015
You have a case.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.484
From my days
in the Mobile Psych Unit.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.467
I'd like to dig into it.

04:44.238 --> 04:46.960
If it's important to you,
then it's important to me.

04:47.045 --> 04:48.199
You're sure
you don't mind?

04:48.283 --> 04:49.326
Of course not.

04:49.584 --> 04:52.054
That's what's so nice
about us finally being

04:52.139 --> 04:55.210
on the same side of things,
same agenda.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.833
No subterfuge.

04:57.108 --> 04:58.507
What you want,
I want.

04:58.592 --> 05:00.462
And you're okay
with my involving the team.

05:00.546 --> 05:02.672
I am.
In fact, I insist.

05:02.811 --> 05:05.069
Idle hands and all that.

05:05.927 --> 05:09.873
But I would like you to
look into something for me.

05:09.966 --> 05:11.038
Of course.

05:11.123 --> 05:13.686
It's about Dembe's...
imam.

05:13.936 --> 05:16.030
- Is there something wrong?
- I don't know yet.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.476
That's what
I need to find out.

05:17.561 --> 05:19.356
But first,
tell me about this

05:19.608 --> 05:21.107
cold case of yours.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.452
They called him
the Boneyard Killer.

05:23.537 --> 05:26.218
His first victim was found
just outside Rehoboth Beach

05:26.303 --> 05:28.865
when local police exhumed a body
for autopsy.

05:29.107 --> 05:30.467
What they found was

05:30.558 --> 05:32.858
a second body
buried in that same grave.

05:32.943 --> 05:35.257
A young woman
four feet below the surface,

05:35.342 --> 05:37.976
resting just above
a freshly buried coffin...

05:38.061 --> 05:39.288
murdered and hidden

05:39.373 --> 05:41.164
in the last place
anyone would ever look for her.

05:41.248 --> 05:44.296
Since then, three women
have been discovered this way

05:44.381 --> 05:46.874
in graveyards in Virginia
and West Virginia.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.885
He was using the cemeteries
as dumpsites.

05:48.969 --> 05:51.390
Anything significant about
the graves that were chosen?

05:51.475 --> 05:53.866
- They were fresh. Easy to dig.
- And the victims?

05:53.951 --> 05:56.460
All young women
with a history of sex work.

05:56.545 --> 05:57.882
Okay, this is,
uh, terrible,

05:57.967 --> 06:00.054
but sex workers are
like 20 times more likely

06:00.139 --> 06:01.826
to be targeted
by serial killers.

06:01.944 --> 06:05.068
True, but none of his victims
were sexually assaulted,

06:05.152 --> 06:07.178
no sign of defensive wounds,

06:07.295 --> 06:09.929
no pre or postmortem
mutilation.

06:10.014 --> 06:11.562
But the way
he killed them...

06:11.647 --> 06:13.210
we found dirt
in their airways.

06:13.295 --> 06:14.709
They were alive
when he buried them.

06:14.850 --> 06:16.054
Alive, yes.

06:16.139 --> 06:17.779
And unconscious.

06:17.905 --> 06:20.523
Pumped so full
of sodium thiopental,

06:20.608 --> 06:22.360
- they'd never wake up.
- I don't understand.

06:22.444 --> 06:24.663
He drugged them so they'd die
in their sleep?

06:24.748 --> 06:26.938
- Why would he do that?
- He didn't want them to suffer.

06:27.022 --> 06:28.859
The case went cold
until a week ago,

06:28.944 --> 06:30.984
when flash floods hit
Montgomery

06:31.069 --> 06:34.515
and upended a few graves
at Greenfare Cemetery,

06:34.600 --> 06:36.945
including one
unidentified body

06:37.030 --> 06:38.489
that wasn't
supposed to be there.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.033
Initial forensics suggest
she was sedated

06:41.117 --> 06:43.202
and buried alive
just like the others.

06:43.287 --> 06:44.491
Has the Bureau reached out
to you?

06:44.575 --> 06:46.077
No, and they're
not going to.

06:46.162 --> 06:47.538
They asked me
to leave the case.

06:47.623 --> 06:50.126
They said my profile
wasn't... additive.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.169
- So this is your cold case.
- Yes.

06:52.253 --> 06:54.755
What do you mean they thought
your profile wasn't "additive"?

06:54.839 --> 06:56.298
I don't think
he wants to kill.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.551
I think he's mimicking
these profiles

06:58.635 --> 07:00.302
in order to hide
some other agenda.

07:00.386 --> 07:01.303
What, I don't know,

07:01.387 --> 07:03.055
but I think he finds
satisfaction

07:03.139 --> 07:05.724
in something other than the act
of the crime itself.

07:05.808 --> 07:06.976
Whatever his motive,

07:07.060 --> 07:08.727
these bodies were found
by chance,

07:08.811 --> 07:10.046
and we can't wait
for another.

07:10.131 --> 07:11.898
Talk to the M.E.
See what he knows.

07:11.983 --> 07:14.900
Let's hope this newest tragedy
will help you find this guy.

07:15.147 --> 07:19.905
Uh, sir, can I ask
for another favor?

07:20.170 --> 07:22.523
Reddington says that
counterterrorism

07:22.608 --> 07:24.273
is sniffing around
Dembe's imam.

07:24.358 --> 07:25.764
He wants to know
what they found.

07:25.849 --> 07:26.912
What were they
looking for?

07:26.996 --> 07:28.342
Syrian jihadists.

07:28.427 --> 07:31.679
Some of the congregants may be
involved with Tahrir al-Sham.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.546
But Dembe thinks
that's impossible.

07:33.631 --> 07:35.131
I'll make a few calls.

07:39.498 --> 07:41.552
Ilya Koslov is out there
somewhere,

07:41.636 --> 07:43.095
and I have no idea where.

07:43.179 --> 07:44.763
Do you know what your mother
wanted from him?

07:44.847 --> 07:47.912
I don't. But she said
her life depended on it.

07:48.637 --> 07:50.293
You were right.

07:50.621 --> 07:52.871
I looked at the original
case files,

07:53.020 --> 07:55.660
and this does appear to be
the work of the same killer.

07:56.402 --> 08:00.738
I have ID'd her
as one Mara Lynne James.

08:00.924 --> 08:03.145
Now, the forensic evidence
on your previous victims

08:03.230 --> 08:05.113
was limited,
but this woman...

08:05.199 --> 08:07.669
the cold slowed the growth
of bacteria,

08:07.754 --> 08:09.246
so I have a better picture
of what happened.

08:09.330 --> 08:10.289
Suffocation?

08:10.373 --> 08:11.849
With sodium thiopental

08:11.934 --> 08:13.512
to sedate her beforehand.

08:13.835 --> 08:15.106
Soil in the lungs.

08:15.191 --> 08:16.962
Same lack of any
defensive wounds.

08:17.046 --> 08:18.797
Was there any evidence
of sexual assault?

08:18.881 --> 08:22.348
No, but she was
sexually active.

08:25.579 --> 08:27.129
She had a baby.

08:27.221 --> 08:29.504
The degree of scarring
around the incision

08:29.589 --> 08:31.747
suggests she gave birth
no more than a month

08:31.832 --> 08:33.113
before she was killed.

08:42.238 --> 08:44.341
Okay, now one more
big push.

08:44.426 --> 08:46.450
- C'mon. You can do it.
- Come on. Push.

08:52.391 --> 08:53.474
You did it.

08:53.559 --> 08:54.583
Is everything okay?

08:54.790 --> 08:56.100
Isn't he supposed to cry
or some...

08:56.184 --> 08:57.841
Yes, she is.

08:57.926 --> 08:59.309
It's a girl.

09:01.716 --> 09:04.598
Rest. Please.

09:05.848 --> 09:07.332
We have work to do.

09:18.852 --> 09:21.121
I tried to get
off the streets.

09:21.586 --> 09:22.950
We both did.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.715
We had every resource
to help her.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.551
We apologize for coming
at such a difficult time.

09:28.809 --> 09:30.060
We're sorry for your loss.

09:30.145 --> 09:31.395
We want you to know
that we've deployed

09:31.479 --> 09:33.147
our Child Abduction
Response team

09:33.231 --> 09:35.024
and alerted every
law enforcement agency

09:35.108 --> 09:36.403
in the country.

09:36.580 --> 09:37.831
What for?

09:38.286 --> 09:40.192
To find Mara's child.

09:40.553 --> 09:42.309
Mara didn't have a child.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.020
According to the M. E.,
she gave birth

09:45.104 --> 09:47.104
a month before
she passed.

09:47.495 --> 09:48.825
A baby?

09:48.910 --> 09:51.121
Did she have a man
in her life?

09:51.379 --> 09:53.375
A man?

09:53.581 --> 09:55.887
You do know what she did
for a living?

09:56.161 --> 09:58.380
Did she talk about anyone
in particular?

09:58.465 --> 10:00.247
Yeah, she talked.
She talked all the time.

10:00.332 --> 10:01.342
None of it was ever true.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.232
Nancy James,
if you know something

10:03.317 --> 10:05.106
that could help
that child...

10:10.370 --> 10:11.957
A year ago...

10:12.604 --> 10:13.938
10 months maybe,

10:14.022 --> 10:17.942
she said she met a guy,
a big fish.

10:18.286 --> 10:20.215
- Did she tell you his name?
- No.

10:21.174 --> 10:23.543
Just that he had a plan.

10:24.301 --> 10:26.192
A way for her
to get out.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.951
CTD and MPD
will be here in 20.

10:31.036 --> 10:32.092
I can't hold them off
any longer.

10:32.176 --> 10:33.715
Did the Bureau do this?

10:33.817 --> 10:35.372
Has my imam been arrested?

10:35.457 --> 10:37.520
CTD says no,
but based on their findings,

10:37.605 --> 10:38.615
maybe they should've.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.297
The case file
Agent Keen asked for.

10:40.381 --> 10:42.083
Apparently, two members
have been smuggling

10:42.168 --> 10:43.884
shipping containers
in and out of Syria.

10:43.968 --> 10:45.755
- For Tahrir al-Sham?
- Unclear.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.872
We don't know what's being
shipped or by whom.

10:47.957 --> 10:51.100
These members in the file.
I've seen them at the services.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.341
- I don't see them as a threat.
- Then where are they?

10:53.426 --> 10:55.872
As soon as you called about the
abduction, we put out a BOLO.

10:55.957 --> 10:57.648
But it appears as if
they're long gone.

10:57.732 --> 10:59.443
Along with Imam Asmal.

10:59.528 --> 11:01.013
The Bureau
didn't do him any favors

11:01.098 --> 11:02.982
by questioning him
here in the mosque.

11:03.067 --> 11:06.223
Made it appear as if he knew
something and might talk.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.992
Can you be sure
he didn't know?

11:09.191 --> 11:11.911
If he said he didn't know,
he didn't know.

11:12.363 --> 11:13.997
What was the port
of origin?

11:14.098 --> 11:16.500
Latakia, Syria.
Why?

11:16.973 --> 11:19.536
Ironically, smuggling
on a large scale

11:19.621 --> 11:22.637
is a profitable
yet surprisingly small club.

11:22.770 --> 11:25.216
And ever since civil war
broke out in Syria,

11:25.301 --> 11:29.122
the margins on everything
from weapons to medical supplies

11:29.207 --> 11:32.513
to narcotics to food
going in and out of the country

11:32.598 --> 11:35.099
have been particularly
bodacious.

11:35.184 --> 11:37.849
As such, there's plenty of room
for all the players.

11:37.934 --> 11:40.708
Turf has been designated.
Territory agreed upon.

11:40.793 --> 11:41.859
Who got Latakia?

11:41.943 --> 11:44.426
A Greek fellow from Queens.

11:45.020 --> 11:46.575
A- And Greece.

11:48.831 --> 11:51.294
How's Mom?
You doing okay?

11:51.379 --> 11:52.620
Great.

11:52.704 --> 11:54.286
Can't stop staring at her.

11:54.371 --> 11:56.207
She is adorable.
You're blessed.

11:56.331 --> 11:58.326
I'm gonna run to the store,
but there was a call

11:58.411 --> 12:00.436
while you two were asleep.
I didn't want to wake you.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.786
An attorney.
Geoffrey Entz.

12:02.871 --> 12:04.786
He said you would know
what it was regarding.

12:04.916 --> 12:06.951
Such a cute baby.

12:07.036 --> 12:08.365
I'll see you soon.

12:25.692 --> 12:26.862
<i>I talked to him.</i>

12:26.946 --> 12:28.981
The lawyer?
What did he say?

12:29.066 --> 12:30.074
That he got the letter,

12:30.158 --> 12:32.379
but he didn't want to discuss it
over the phone.

12:32.618 --> 12:33.879
Did he ask to meet?

12:33.964 --> 12:37.380
Yes, but I-I didn't think
it would be this soon.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.505
- I'm not prepared.
- <i>I told you, Angela.</i>

12:39.590 --> 12:41.145
I have it all worked out.

12:41.816 --> 12:43.013
Like a script.

12:43.098 --> 12:45.631
I'll coach you
through everything.

12:47.832 --> 12:50.594
<i>Listen, I'm not in a good place
to talk right now,</i>

12:50.690 --> 12:53.036
so let me call you back.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.896
I think
I may have something.

13:09.981 --> 13:11.857
As you may know,
genetic material passes

13:11.942 --> 13:13.833
from mother to child
during pregnancy,

13:13.918 --> 13:15.177
but what you may not know

13:15.262 --> 13:17.466
is it also happens
in reverse.

13:17.551 --> 13:20.622
Fetal cells cross the placenta
and enter the mother's body,

13:20.707 --> 13:24.154
making up as much as 10%
of the free-floating DNA

13:24.239 --> 13:25.936
- in her bloodstream.
- How does that help us?

13:26.020 --> 13:27.505
Well,
with the M. E.'s help,

13:27.590 --> 13:30.779
I was able to run the fetal DNA
from Mara James

13:30.864 --> 13:33.825
against databases
from genetic testing services.

13:33.909 --> 13:36.536
And with almost absolute
certainty,

13:36.620 --> 13:38.856
the father of her child
is...

13:39.456 --> 13:40.887
Jonathan McClaire.

13:41.142 --> 13:42.903
- The self-help guru?
- The same.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.239
Author of six books.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.364
He runs workshops
all around the world.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.364
A married man
living a public life

13:48.449 --> 13:50.262
has a child
with a prostitute?

13:51.175 --> 13:52.577
Bring him in.
Find out what he has to say.

13:52.661 --> 13:54.871
Right, uh, about that.
Here's the thing.

13:55.025 --> 13:56.207
He didn't kill her.

13:56.530 --> 13:57.653
Well,
how do you know that?

13:57.738 --> 14:00.395
Because he died
11 months before

14:00.602 --> 14:02.075
Mara James was murdered.

14:12.095 --> 14:14.668
Kendra,
what I am offering you

14:15.218 --> 14:18.106
is a chance to change your life.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.442
A way out.

14:19.527 --> 14:22.247
And forget about debt
or your car payments.

14:22.332 --> 14:23.707
This is far more than that.

14:24.129 --> 14:25.629
If you can imagine,

14:26.707 --> 14:28.856
I am the last man
that you ever

14:28.941 --> 14:31.361
have to meet
in a hotel room.

14:31.690 --> 14:32.996
Ever.

14:34.144 --> 14:36.012
How much
are we talking about?

14:43.939 --> 14:46.137
Tell me again
how this works.

14:51.219 --> 14:52.461
That's it!

14:58.425 --> 15:01.305
Mr. Korba,
what a pleasure!

15:01.390 --> 15:03.064
Your reputation
precedes you.

15:03.149 --> 15:05.681
Mine may not, so allow me
to introduce myself.

15:05.766 --> 15:07.472
I know who you are.
You don't scare me.

15:09.557 --> 15:10.954
My heavens.

15:11.766 --> 15:14.393
Is that A5 olive wagyu?

15:14.478 --> 15:16.897
I didn't know
you did business in Japan.

15:16.982 --> 15:19.650
Or did these just fall off
a truck somewhere

15:19.735 --> 15:22.821
on their circuitous journey
to Nobu Damascus?

15:22.905 --> 15:24.489
I'm a legitimate
businessman.

15:24.573 --> 15:26.219
Yes, I'm sure you are.

15:26.304 --> 15:27.501
But as it happens,

15:27.586 --> 15:30.786
I'm not necessarily
interested in your beef.

15:30.871 --> 15:34.291
I'm really here to discuss
Jalal Abbas and his friends,

15:34.375 --> 15:37.919
and whatever they're bringing
into the country from Syria.

15:38.087 --> 15:40.173
I may have the face
of an angel,

15:40.258 --> 15:41.767
but I'm not telling you
anything.

15:41.852 --> 15:43.111
On the contrary,

15:43.196 --> 15:45.501
I think you're going to tell me
where they are

15:45.808 --> 15:47.625
and what they're smuggling.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.088
You think you're the first guy
to threaten me?

15:51.173 --> 15:52.851
I'm not threatening you,
Costas.

15:52.935 --> 15:54.751
I'm threatening
your livelihood.

15:54.883 --> 15:58.523
Did you know these cows
that gave up their lives

15:58.607 --> 16:00.358
to be here today

16:00.442 --> 16:03.025
grew up on the island
of Shodoshima?

16:03.110 --> 16:06.213
And let me tell you,
those cows had it good.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.994
Frolicking over
sun-dappled hillsides,

16:09.079 --> 16:13.002
dining on olive peels
from Japan's oldest plantation.

16:13.087 --> 16:18.845
I'm told one cow can sell
for $40,000, $50,000 wholesale.

16:18.930 --> 16:23.391
Rounding down, I'm probably
looking at 30 quarters.

16:23.540 --> 16:26.821
Given the average rate
of cooling, once I kill the AC,

16:26.930 --> 16:29.513
you've probably got,
what, 45 minutes

16:29.597 --> 16:32.126
before your
half a million dollars

16:32.211 --> 16:33.891
of umami-flavored goodness

16:33.976 --> 16:36.019
will be worth less
than a shinbone.

16:36.103 --> 16:38.230
I don't know what they had
in those shipment containers.

16:38.314 --> 16:39.298
I don't.

16:39.383 --> 16:41.055
But you know
where they went.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.837
Yes. Yes, I do.

16:45.446 --> 16:47.416
I didn't know
the FBI

16:47.501 --> 16:49.641
investigated
car accidents.

16:49.726 --> 16:52.525
We're not here about your
husband's death, Mrs. McClaire.

16:52.610 --> 16:55.782
We'd like to talk about his
relationship with Mara James.

16:56.123 --> 16:57.707
What did she tell you?

16:58.173 --> 17:00.532
She signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

17:00.673 --> 17:02.188
Mara James is dead.

17:02.273 --> 17:03.732
She was murdered.

17:04.005 --> 17:05.570
Oh, my God.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.542
That's awful.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.563
You said
she signed a contract.

17:13.515 --> 17:17.540
My husband had an affair
that resulted in a child.

17:18.023 --> 17:20.751
Ms. James approached
our attorneys.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.320
Jonathan had only recently
passed, and so I settled.

17:25.954 --> 17:27.820
We didn't find a record
of any settlement.

17:27.906 --> 17:29.490
It was sealed.

17:29.698 --> 17:32.409
My husband's career
was based on...

17:33.844 --> 17:36.641
...the appearance
of a happy marriage.

17:37.337 --> 17:39.532
Even now,
I live off the book sales.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.919
And sales would dry up if anyone
knew he'd been unfaithful.

17:43.227 --> 17:45.282
So you agreed
to a secret settlement.

17:46.110 --> 17:49.829
Well, there was a DNA test,
so I know it was his child, but...

17:50.876 --> 17:52.899
we were so happy.

17:55.196 --> 17:59.938
I still can't believe he stepped
outside of our marriage.

18:09.697 --> 18:10.994
What am I looking at?

18:11.079 --> 18:13.408
The victims we found
eight years ago.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.166
Their bodies were
so decomposed

18:15.251 --> 18:16.893
they didn't have C-section scars
like Mara's,

18:16.977 --> 18:17.994
but take a look at this.

18:18.079 --> 18:19.955
Pockmarks
along the pelvic bone

18:20.040 --> 18:22.667
caused by ligaments tearing
during childbirth.

18:23.219 --> 18:24.697
Our victims
were all mothers.

18:24.782 --> 18:27.267
If they all had babies,
did they all have secret settlements?

18:27.352 --> 18:29.517
The point of secret settlements
is that they're secret.

18:29.602 --> 18:31.503
It could take months to track
down the right courthouses

18:31.587 --> 18:33.151
- and secure warrants.
- That's what I thought,

18:33.235 --> 18:34.643
but it's a good thing
we know a criminal

18:34.727 --> 18:36.555
who can cut through
the red tape.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.321
I'll be obliged to take a sniff
in your company.

18:54.493 --> 18:58.501
Yes, I understand your feeling
of obligation.

18:58.610 --> 18:59.704
Ahh!

19:07.835 --> 19:09.283
Mickey,
how long have you been

19:09.368 --> 19:11.049
the file clerk
for the courthouse?

19:11.235 --> 19:13.510
Must be going on 25 years.

19:13.704 --> 19:15.900
Shepherding
a national database

19:15.985 --> 19:19.228
of pleadings and motions,
suits and countersuits.

19:19.313 --> 19:22.376
Everyone's
dirty little secrets.

19:22.461 --> 19:26.243
Pearl's angina has been acting up.

19:26.390 --> 19:29.328
Set us back
a little more than usual.

19:29.421 --> 19:31.563
Huh.
Hm.

19:33.062 --> 19:35.541
You're worth it
at twice the price.

19:35.626 --> 19:37.681
And Pearl is priceless.

19:39.188 --> 19:43.252
Brother, you sure know
how to wet my whistle.

19:43.337 --> 19:46.334
Yes, sir,
you most certainly do.

19:46.418 --> 19:47.711
Mmm!

19:47.795 --> 19:48.938
Ahh!

19:49.032 --> 19:51.089
So, what can I do you for?

19:51.774 --> 19:54.588
Mr. Reddington pays for
his wife's angina medication?

19:54.673 --> 19:56.377
Medication,
hospital visits.

19:56.462 --> 19:59.791
I get the impression he pays for
whatever the file clerk needs.

19:59.876 --> 20:01.600
What have you found
in the settlements?

20:01.837 --> 20:04.478
I'm hoping it's enough
to justify the, shall we say,

20:04.563 --> 20:06.455
unorthodox way
in which we obtained them.

20:06.540 --> 20:09.783
The victims we're aware of
all had children out of wedlock

20:09.868 --> 20:11.369
with very wealthy men,

20:11.454 --> 20:14.197
and they all made paternity
claims against the fathers,

20:14.282 --> 20:15.447
which were all settled.

20:15.532 --> 20:16.978
And within weeks
of the agreements,

20:17.063 --> 20:18.241
each of the women
were murdered.

20:18.325 --> 20:19.284
And the children?

20:19.368 --> 20:21.077
We haven't found
a single one.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.877
- So, what have we found?
- Death certificates.

20:23.962 --> 20:27.111
Turns out Jonathan McClaire
wasn't the only father who died

20:27.196 --> 20:29.634
before the mother of his child.
They all did.

20:29.719 --> 20:32.056
So five mothers who died
soon after giving birth,

20:32.141 --> 20:34.751
and five fathers who died
soon after conception.

20:34.852 --> 20:37.052
The men died
in at least four states,

20:37.136 --> 20:38.595
all in crazy accidents...

20:38.837 --> 20:41.705
helicopter crash,
a pileup on I-80.

20:41.790 --> 20:43.931
Each event was investigated,
but cleared.

20:44.016 --> 20:45.970
No foul play.
Nothing to connect them.

20:46.055 --> 20:49.071
Nothing except for a name.
Nyle Hatcher.

20:49.156 --> 20:51.509
He signed one of their death
certificates in Pennsylvania,

20:51.594 --> 20:52.861
which I thought was
pretty odd,

20:52.946 --> 20:54.767
considering he's a mortician
in Bethesda.

20:54.852 --> 20:56.220
So I kept digging.

20:56.305 --> 20:58.689
Turns out he ID'd another victim
in Delaware

20:58.774 --> 21:00.642
and notified next of kin
in West Virginia.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.009
Doesn't make any sense.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.556
A mortician from Bethesda

21:03.641 --> 21:06.502
dealing with bodies from places
like Delaware and West Virginia.

21:06.587 --> 21:08.354
According to his employment
records, he used to operate

21:08.438 --> 21:10.767
a funeral home
outside Rehoboth Beach.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.882
Makes sense.
He had access to the cemetery.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.259
And no one
would question

21:14.344 --> 21:16.053
why a mortician
was hanging around.

21:16.137 --> 21:17.969
- Did you get an address?
- 452 Elm,

21:18.054 --> 21:20.889
the same as the mortuary
he currently operates...

21:20.974 --> 21:22.680
Sweet Rest Funeral Home.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.349
Keen, Ressler, get going.

21:24.434 --> 21:26.141
Aram, pull a warrant.

21:27.355 --> 21:29.830
When you got the settlements
from Reddington,

21:29.915 --> 21:31.641
did he say anything
about Dembe's imam?

21:31.726 --> 21:33.185
He got a lead
on the smugglers,

21:33.270 --> 21:35.540
and I think he's going
to pay them a visit.

21:35.625 --> 21:37.470
I don't suppose it would do
any good to remind him

21:37.554 --> 21:38.638
that's our job.

21:38.723 --> 21:39.890
He knows.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.485
He just doesn't care.

21:44.710 --> 21:46.294
Mr. Hatcher's out today.

21:46.379 --> 21:48.527
Said he won't be in until Monday.

21:48.611 --> 21:49.867
Said it's
a family matter.

21:49.968 --> 21:51.954
- Did he say where he was going?
- No.

21:52.039 --> 21:53.267
He's not answering.

21:53.351 --> 21:54.993
Do you have any other way
of reaching him?

21:55.078 --> 21:56.274
Not anymore.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.719
He used to keep
an apartment upstairs.

21:59.612 --> 22:01.032
Now he only has his office.

22:01.117 --> 22:02.758
We're gonna need
his current home address.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.289
And access to that office.

22:04.374 --> 22:06.718
Um, okay, but it's private.

22:07.261 --> 22:08.516
I'm not allowed in there.

22:08.601 --> 22:10.243
Well, that's okay.
I am.

22:10.478 --> 22:11.782
This is a warrant.

22:24.673 --> 22:26.133
What the hell?

22:34.819 --> 22:36.423
This woman,
he's following her.

22:36.629 --> 22:38.368
He's got all kinds of data.

22:44.368 --> 22:45.805
Keen, what is it?

22:46.539 --> 22:48.666
I'm not sure
I want to know.

23:02.906 --> 23:04.703
Kendra. Hi.

23:04.840 --> 23:06.927
I'm, um, Agent Mojtabai.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.537
You're, uh...
You're not under arrest.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.751
- Could've fooled me.
- Yeah. About that...

23:11.975 --> 23:14.033
Let me...
Let me get that for you.

23:15.461 --> 23:17.727
If I'm not under arrest,
why am I here?

23:17.888 --> 23:21.813
To talk about a man
named Nyle Hatcher.

23:22.774 --> 23:26.180
In my line of work,
I meet lots of men.

23:26.979 --> 23:28.251
Right, um...

23:28.336 --> 23:30.008
This one
runs a funeral home.

23:30.919 --> 23:32.485
And...

23:34.563 --> 23:35.868
he murders women.

23:40.173 --> 23:42.024
Yeah, I know the guy.

23:42.821 --> 23:44.860
Hatcher was in Baltimore
yesterday.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.126
The ferry-boat accident.

23:46.211 --> 23:47.533
Sixteen people drowned.

23:47.618 --> 23:49.661
DMORT was deployed
to identify the victims.

23:49.745 --> 23:52.532
The Disaster Mortuary
Operational Response Teams.

23:52.617 --> 23:54.321
When there's
a mass-casualty event,

23:54.416 --> 23:56.547
morticians are brought in
to help identify the bodies,

23:56.632 --> 23:57.657
assess cause of death.

23:57.742 --> 23:59.274
The country is divided
by region,

23:59.359 --> 24:01.027
and based on where the victims
were found,

24:01.112 --> 24:04.031
Hatcher operates with
Region III, which includes

24:04.116 --> 24:07.202
D. C., Virginia, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, and Maryland.

24:07.287 --> 24:09.372
Which is why a Bethesda
mortician gets access

24:09.457 --> 24:11.667
to rich men at crime scenes
up and down the East Coast.

24:11.752 --> 24:13.754
Well, we know how Hatcher
interacted with the dead men.

24:13.838 --> 24:16.674
But we still have no idea
what part he played... if any...

24:16.930 --> 24:19.508
in the paternity cases
or the deaths of the mothers.

24:19.593 --> 24:21.442
Actually, we do.

24:21.527 --> 24:22.944
<i>He didn't want to hook up.</i>

24:23.028 --> 24:24.759
I thought he did,
but when I got there,

24:24.844 --> 24:28.610
he knew everything about me...
family, money problems.

24:28.758 --> 24:29.938
He said he could fix
all that.

24:30.023 --> 24:32.411
By getting you pregnant and
suing the father for paternity.

24:32.496 --> 24:33.696
He said
no one would get hurt,

24:33.781 --> 24:35.699
that a rich dude
would be a little less rich.

24:36.041 --> 24:37.493
And the baby?

24:38.167 --> 24:40.127
He told me about
these safe-haven laws

24:40.212 --> 24:42.088
where you leave babies
at fire stations

24:42.172 --> 24:43.438
and they get adopted.

24:43.885 --> 24:45.274
Adopted.

24:46.547 --> 24:48.805
Because the father
would already be dead.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.422
Run that by me again.

24:51.872 --> 24:53.657
We found sperm
in his office.

24:53.851 --> 24:57.270
There was a thermos, and in it,
uh, there was a sample.

24:57.407 --> 24:59.814
- Sperm from a dead man?
- The rich dead man.

24:59.898 --> 25:03.318
The one Hatcher s-selected
from his DMORT assignment.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.111
Did the men use
a-a donor bank?

25:05.195 --> 25:06.821
Is that where he got
the samples?

25:06.905 --> 25:07.989
We don't think so.

25:08.073 --> 25:09.751
Then what exactly
do you think?

25:10.033 --> 25:11.720
Hatcher inseminated
the women

25:11.805 --> 25:13.883
using semen he extracted
from the corpses.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.766
Apparently, sperm is viable
up to 36 hours postmortem.

25:17.851 --> 25:20.001
He extracts the sperm,
impregnates the mother,

25:20.085 --> 25:22.087
who then makes an embarrassing
paternity claim

25:22.172 --> 25:23.423
that's backed up by DNA.

25:23.508 --> 25:26.150
Now, rather than risk a scandal,
the widow hushes it up

25:26.235 --> 25:28.455
with a secret settlement
and no one's the wiser

25:28.540 --> 25:30.845
because dead men tell
no tales.

25:30.929 --> 25:32.514
Even about their seed.

25:32.805 --> 25:34.258
What about Kendra Taylor?

25:34.409 --> 25:35.791
Is she pregnant?

25:35.876 --> 25:37.310
You never met Roger Ashby?

25:37.394 --> 25:39.187
No, the hookup was
supposed to be tomorrow.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.711
Is that what Hatcher told you,
it was gonna be a hookup?

25:41.796 --> 25:43.946
He didn't exactly say.
Why?

25:44.071 --> 25:45.777
Because Roger Ashby died
yesterday

25:45.861 --> 25:47.501
in a ferry-boat accident.

25:49.563 --> 25:51.022
Like I said, all I know

25:51.106 --> 25:53.507
is the hookup was gonna be
tomorrow, and after that,

25:53.592 --> 25:55.344
I was supposed to make a claim
for child support.

25:55.428 --> 25:56.747
Once the settlement
was finalized,

25:56.831 --> 26:00.327
Hatcher would take the money,
and you'd end up dead.

26:04.046 --> 26:05.464
That's the last of it.

26:05.670 --> 26:07.090
The money for you
and your meal ticket

26:07.174 --> 26:09.874
will be wired to the account
by end of business today.

26:14.124 --> 26:16.124
Her name is Lily.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.428
We're done here.

26:21.397 --> 26:23.607
Hey, um, guys,
so, uh...

26:23.691 --> 26:26.148
Kendra says that
she and the target never met.

26:26.233 --> 26:29.488
But that Hatcher told her
she'd be impregnated tomorrow.

26:29.771 --> 26:31.572
By a man who died
yesterday.

26:31.657 --> 26:33.081
So what am I missing?

26:33.166 --> 26:34.661
The birds and the bees?

26:34.746 --> 26:36.471
Lemme tell you,
there's a whole new wrinkle.

26:36.556 --> 26:37.746
I accessed
Hatcher's hard drive.

26:37.830 --> 26:38.997
He had a list of the fathers

26:39.081 --> 26:40.457
and how much the widows
agreed to pay.

26:40.541 --> 26:42.341
We know all that
from the secret settlements.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.231
You know
almost all of it.

26:44.316 --> 26:46.388
There was another name.
Abraham Geller.

26:46.473 --> 26:47.606
Wealthy hedge fund guy.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.341
Died in a plane crash
10 months ago.

26:49.425 --> 26:51.708
Which might mean someone just
gave birth to his child...

26:51.793 --> 26:53.262
and may have signed
a settlement offer.

26:53.346 --> 26:54.763
Or her death warrant.

26:54.965 --> 26:57.123
You two, find the lawyer
who handles the Geller estate.

26:57.207 --> 26:58.308
See what he knows.

26:58.392 --> 27:00.129
Um, the birds
and the bees?

27:00.902 --> 27:02.223
What's the new wrinkle?

27:07.887 --> 27:09.419
Did the transfer
go through?

27:09.504 --> 27:11.410
Just.
You did well.

27:11.551 --> 27:12.879
The hard part's over.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.355
Your cut's over a hundred
thousand dollars, Angela.

27:17.613 --> 27:20.622
So drop off the child
and meet me at Cedar Wind.

27:20.707 --> 27:24.137
I promise you, when you get
what's coming to you,

27:24.387 --> 27:26.941
your life will change forever.

27:38.801 --> 27:41.012
Agents Ressler and Park,
FBI.

27:41.113 --> 27:42.227
Uh, what can I do
for you?

27:42.311 --> 27:44.669
Was a paternity claim made
against Abraham Geller?

27:44.754 --> 27:46.622
I don't discuss
my clients' cases.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.177
This isn't about your client.
It's about a woman's life.

27:49.262 --> 27:51.638
I'm sure you can appreciate
this is privileged information.

27:51.723 --> 27:53.723
Yes, but it's
a life-threatening situation.

27:53.808 --> 27:56.356
What you know could save
Angela Hendrickson's life.

27:56.441 --> 27:57.997
- Has she been here?
- Yeah.

27:58.082 --> 28:00.348
To chisel a decent family
out of a small fortune.

28:00.433 --> 28:02.755
So she signed a settlement agreement.
You wired the money?

28:02.840 --> 28:05.375
I did.
Less than an hour ago.

28:14.532 --> 28:16.325
Mm.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.100
I thought you'd be alone.

28:22.184 --> 28:25.145
I... couldn't leave her.

28:25.229 --> 28:26.938
I know it wasn't
what we agreed to.

28:27.022 --> 28:28.864
Oh, no, don't give it
another thought.

28:29.176 --> 28:30.358
I'm glad she's here.

28:30.443 --> 28:32.579
I think every child should have
a loving home.

28:32.672 --> 28:34.112
Just not yours.

28:44.547 --> 28:46.648
I found her. Angela Hendrickson.

28:46.733 --> 28:49.427
Now, she's not answering our calls,
but she received a call

28:49.512 --> 28:51.930
outside a Rockville Fire station
30 minutes ago,

28:52.015 --> 28:54.633
and her cell just pinged
a tower off county road 75.

28:54.718 --> 28:55.851
What's the green area?

28:55.935 --> 28:57.889
That is Cedar Wind Cemetery
in Livingston.

28:58.889 --> 29:00.110
Oh, cemetery. That's bad.

29:00.195 --> 29:01.930
Ressler. That's,
uh... That's really bad.

29:02.015 --> 29:03.507
Ressler,
we have a location.

29:03.593 --> 29:05.116
Keen will meet you
on-site.

29:29.218 --> 29:31.011
Aww. Hey, baby.

29:31.304 --> 29:33.773
We're almost finished.
We'll be home soon.

29:35.117 --> 29:36.368
Oh, my.

29:36.662 --> 29:39.539
Angela, I am so sorry.

29:39.624 --> 29:42.210
I never meant
for you to see this.

30:07.423 --> 30:09.249
- Yeah?
- Jalal?

30:09.570 --> 30:10.718
Who are you?

30:10.818 --> 30:12.593
A friend from the mosque.

30:13.334 --> 30:14.632
Aah!

30:16.319 --> 30:18.031
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

30:18.544 --> 30:20.129
Okay, okay! Okay!

30:25.753 --> 30:26.879
Go ahead.

30:39.710 --> 30:41.297
Where is Imam Asmal?

30:41.382 --> 30:43.383
I don't know. I don't.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.133
- I'm sorry.
- You do.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.628
Answer the question.

30:46.827 --> 30:49.423
Hello, little girl.
We'll be home real soon.

30:52.551 --> 30:54.168
Good heavens.

30:55.765 --> 30:57.766
Hands!
Put your hands in the air!

30:57.851 --> 30:59.190
Got a baby here.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.026
Where is she?!

31:01.227 --> 31:03.362
Angela Hendrickson
...where?! I don't...

31:03.447 --> 31:04.448
I don't know who that is.

31:04.533 --> 31:05.814
Where is she, Nyle?

31:07.650 --> 31:09.432
- Which grave?
- I have no...

31:09.541 --> 31:10.487
- Answer me!
- I have no

31:10.572 --> 31:12.760
earthly idea
what you mean!

31:13.354 --> 31:15.730
He doesn't want her to suffer,
so she's sedated,

31:15.815 --> 31:17.635
but she may still be alive.

31:17.780 --> 31:19.198
We need to fan out.

31:19.283 --> 31:21.159
We're looking
for a fresh grave.

31:21.244 --> 31:22.999
There can't be many.

31:32.268 --> 31:34.134
How do we get
to the basement?

31:34.510 --> 31:36.094
I don't have a basement.

31:56.674 --> 31:58.033
Morgan.

32:17.523 --> 32:19.828
Hey!
I got something!

32:29.039 --> 32:30.357
I feel something!

32:41.882 --> 32:43.195
She's got a pulse.

32:43.421 --> 32:45.706
Get on the radio!
Call the paramedics!

32:59.487 --> 33:01.523
What the hell?

33:18.258 --> 33:20.759
Womens were brutalized,
how many were they?

33:22.407 --> 33:24.017
I try not to think
about them.

33:31.923 --> 33:34.044
It wasn't personal.

33:34.766 --> 33:37.439
I needed hosts
willing to break the law,

33:37.524 --> 33:41.051
and they did that just by
showing up at my hotel room.

33:41.860 --> 33:44.735
Desperate and broke...

33:45.641 --> 33:48.157
And what... dispensable?

33:49.626 --> 33:52.619
It isn't my fault that
nobody cares when a prostitute dies.

33:52.704 --> 33:55.579
No, people care.
Families care.

33:56.774 --> 34:00.329
This was never about
killing those women.

34:02.438 --> 34:07.134
Agent Keen, I have spent my life
surrounded by death...

34:08.141 --> 34:11.877
surrounded by the pain
that comes with life's end,

34:11.962 --> 34:13.306
the futility of it all.

34:13.391 --> 34:15.103
It's a lonely existence.

34:15.188 --> 34:17.658
One that I thought
money could change.

34:17.743 --> 34:19.563
So I came up with a way
to steal money

34:19.649 --> 34:22.001
from people that wouldn't care
that it was missing...

34:22.157 --> 34:23.427
the dead.

34:23.938 --> 34:26.049
I like to think of them
as "donors."

34:26.134 --> 34:28.463
But the donors required
hosts...

34:28.547 --> 34:33.587
women who, sadly, needed to die
to protect the plan...

34:33.813 --> 34:37.330
which is why I chose women
who needed to be freed

34:37.415 --> 34:40.282
from their otherwise
insufferable lives.

34:42.063 --> 34:45.306
Finally, the plan requires
a child.

34:46.868 --> 34:48.297
What did you do
with the children?

34:48.389 --> 34:49.639
Well, I tell
all the mothers

34:49.724 --> 34:51.809
that I plan to give
the newborns away.

34:51.893 --> 34:54.270
Some mother don't like that,
and some, like Angela,

34:54.353 --> 34:56.610
even try to keep
their babies.

34:56.898 --> 34:59.502
That upset me at first,
until I realized

34:59.587 --> 35:04.322
that the money those children
provided me wasn't the solution.

35:04.640 --> 35:07.157
The children were
the solution.

35:08.618 --> 35:10.561
What does that mean?

35:10.876 --> 35:13.289
It means I couldn't leave them
at the fire station

35:13.373 --> 35:14.666
like I thought.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.016
Means I needed them.

35:16.209 --> 35:19.379
Means I couldn't let them go,
that they needed me.

35:19.463 --> 35:20.641
Needed you?

35:20.827 --> 35:23.454
Forging the adoption paperwork
wasn't cheap,

35:23.592 --> 35:25.843
but money isn't a problem
for me.

35:26.095 --> 35:29.861
I just didn't want any of those
kids to grow up alone...

35:31.227 --> 35:33.851
...like me, without a family.

35:34.016 --> 35:37.266
They needed sisters
and brothers.

35:37.399 --> 35:39.192
Where are the kids,
Nyle?

35:39.277 --> 35:40.571
They're home.

35:41.108 --> 35:42.634
They have all they need.

35:42.903 --> 35:44.345
A loving father.

35:44.613 --> 35:46.989
Unbelievable
financial resources.

35:47.329 --> 35:49.617
What's gonna happen
to those kids?

35:50.056 --> 35:52.735
What are they gonna say
when they find out what you did?

35:52.837 --> 35:54.622
Oh, don't tell them
what I did.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.326
They don't need to know.

35:56.411 --> 35:58.868
They gave me
such a precious gift.

35:59.142 --> 36:00.460
I mean, I was dead.

36:00.545 --> 36:02.173
They brought me back to life.

36:02.313 --> 36:04.641
All that matters
are those kids' lives.

36:05.009 --> 36:08.220
And with you in prison,
they're gonna be a whole lot better.

36:10.472 --> 36:11.556
Imam Asmal.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.349
I'm telling you
I don't know.

36:13.433 --> 36:14.766
Who are they?

36:15.227 --> 36:17.228
Refugees seeking asylum.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.400
Imam Asmal knows
nothing of this.

36:19.485 --> 36:22.525
I thought the FBI took him
because they thought he did.

36:22.790 --> 36:25.049
And you have no ties
to Tahrir al-Sham.

36:25.134 --> 36:28.243
Me? I'm trying to save them
from Tahrir al-Sham.

36:28.336 --> 36:31.541
The United States has made it
illegal for them to come here.

36:31.626 --> 36:33.784
But the Prophet Muhammed teaches us

36:33.868 --> 36:35.791
not to obey the created

36:35.876 --> 36:38.392
if it means disobeying
the Creator.

36:38.477 --> 36:40.830
Harold?
CTD traced a cellphone

36:40.915 --> 36:42.525
belonging to
one of the extremists.

36:42.610 --> 36:44.627
They traced it to a safe house
in West Adams.

36:44.712 --> 36:45.757
Units are en route.

36:45.841 --> 36:48.217
They're not extremists.
They're humanitarians.

36:48.704 --> 36:50.791
Humanitarians
took the imam?

36:50.876 --> 36:53.055
How long do we have
before the troops arrive?

36:53.313 --> 36:54.932
You are at the safe house.

36:55.837 --> 36:58.436
It's feeling less and
less safe with every second.

37:09.852 --> 37:12.909
Looks like your cold-case
theory was right, Liz.

37:12.993 --> 37:14.252
I confirmed it.

37:14.337 --> 37:16.649
He set the money aside
for the children.

37:16.961 --> 37:19.493
A guy with a conscience
who does what he did,

37:19.595 --> 37:21.793
that's way scarier
than a straight psychopath.

37:22.227 --> 37:25.174

husbands didn't cheat on them.

You're the one who's scared.

39:22.922 --> 39:24.750
Reddington got to you.

39:26.119 --> 39:29.978
Ilya Koslov has information that
could save my mother's life.

39:30.986 --> 39:33.783

from finding it.

39:34.494 --> 39:36.719
