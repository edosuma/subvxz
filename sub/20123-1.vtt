00:29.464 --> 00:31.727
I am centered and focused.

00:35.209 --> 00:38.560
Nothing can take away my shine.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.174
Right.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.350
I hope you can see it.

00:46.394 --> 00:47.743
I put blue tape
where I want it.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.140
Glad you're
not particular.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.619
Come on,
I'm not that particular.

00:54.663 --> 00:57.100
Oh, please.
You're a designer.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.711
So are you,
as of today.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.235
That is correct.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.194
Perfect.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.369
Thanks, guys.

01:05.413 --> 01:06.327
Come here.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.205
So now,
when you're creating...

01:16.337 --> 01:17.207
that's what you'll see.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.557
You're kidding me!

01:19.601 --> 01:22.038
I can see
the Astoria Tower.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.822
Our first project
together.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.128
That, right there,

01:25.172 --> 01:26.956
is why I left Baluster Bay
to join you.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.436
Oh, really?

01:28.479 --> 01:29.524
'Cause I thought it was
because our boss closed shop

01:29.567 --> 01:30.438
so he could retire.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.745
So there was that, too,

01:33.789 --> 01:36.444
and the promotion,

01:36.487 --> 01:37.880
but mostly,

01:37.923 --> 01:39.882
it was your vision.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.406
Yeah, I just hope
it pans out, though,

01:42.450 --> 01:44.147
because, so far,

01:44.191 --> 01:45.714
that good old meditation app
you recommended

01:45.757 --> 01:47.629
is not helping my nerves.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.631
You just have to give it
a little bit more time,

01:49.674 --> 01:51.285
and stop worrying.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.200
It is going to be amazing.

01:53.243 --> 01:56.116
Julia Galvins Design
is going to be huge.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.987
What if it isn't?

01:58.030 --> 01:59.249
I mean...

01:59.293 --> 02:00.685
what if-- what if
you came here for nothing?

02:00.729 --> 02:02.034
I'm just...

02:02.078 --> 02:03.558
Really great at what you do,
and everyone knows it,

02:03.601 --> 02:05.560
and that's why
you didn't take another job,

02:05.603 --> 02:08.127
and why I decided
to take this one with you.

02:08.170 --> 02:10.217
It's day one.

02:10.259 --> 02:11.609
You've already landed a pitch.

02:11.653 --> 02:12.828
You're right.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.003
I just need to stay focused,

02:14.046 --> 02:16.136
and everything
will to be fine, right?

02:17.789 --> 02:19.139
Right.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.273
So...

02:24.840 --> 02:25.928
does this mean
we're open for business?

02:27.364 --> 02:28.844
Almost.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.889
I just need to pick out
my belated birthday present

02:30.933 --> 02:32.195
to myself,

02:32.239 --> 02:33.979
and then our office
will be complete.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.514
You're clearly
in denial.

02:46.557 --> 02:49.212
We need more space.
Even our wall knows it.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.214
We don't need more space.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.868
We just...

02:52.911 --> 02:55.044
may have to consider
a collage of all our graduates.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.831
How's a collage going
to get us more storage?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.224
More yard space?
Another room?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.226
If we think big...

03:03.270 --> 03:04.184
You're starting
to sound like Bridget.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.230
Hey!

03:07.274 --> 03:08.231
Hey!

03:08.275 --> 03:09.363
Who's your best friend?

03:09.406 --> 03:10.755
You know you are.

03:10.799 --> 03:11.800
That's right,

03:11.843 --> 03:13.193
so don't you dare compare me

03:13.236 --> 03:14.629
to the girl
who broke your heart.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.500
She's the one who insisted
we needed to franchise.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.067
I'm just saying
that we could...

03:19.242 --> 03:21.070
You're messing with me,
aren't you?

03:21.113 --> 03:22.811
13 years, and I can still
pull one over on you.

03:22.854 --> 03:24.334
Only because you studied
Behavioral Science,

03:24.378 --> 03:25.901
and you know my patterns now.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.250
Which is why I think
we should focus

03:27.294 --> 03:28.382
on what really matters.

03:28.425 --> 03:29.731
A new filing system?

03:29.774 --> 03:30.645
No.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.650
Working with these guys.

03:36.781 --> 03:37.913
Mm?

03:39.306 --> 03:40.350
Hey, what up?

03:40.394 --> 03:41.917
: Welcome

03:41.960 --> 03:44.746
to Love at First Bark's
annual adoption fair.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.337
I don't know
how I'm supposed to choose one.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.860
They're all so adorable.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.862
Well, let's start
with the size.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.168
What kind of dog
are you looking for?

04:16.212 --> 04:18.910
Uh, I work from home,
so an office dog.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.348
Right, something
with a more mild temperament.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.784
Do you have
any experience with dogs?

04:22.827 --> 04:25.308
Actual experience?
Uh, no.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.528
I've always wanted one
since I was a little girl,

04:27.571 --> 04:29.356
so does that count?

04:29.399 --> 04:31.096
It depends
on why you didn't get one.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.751
Oh, my parents were surgeons
in the military,

04:33.795 --> 04:36.188
so we were always on the move.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.973
Wasn't really
the best setup for a dog.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.583
Well, it sounds like you
have the perfect setup now.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.628
Yeah.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.286
Oh!

04:48.636 --> 04:50.072
Hi!

04:50.115 --> 04:51.595
King?

04:51.639 --> 04:52.988
Oh, wow.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.164
That's a very regal name.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.079
He's been with us
for a while.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.820
He's sweet, but strong-willed.

04:58.863 --> 05:01.083
Just hasn't really
connected with anyone yet.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.389
It looks
like he likes you, though.

05:02.432 --> 05:05.043
Yeah, looks
like it.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.001
Well, my name
is Julia.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.003
No royal connection,

05:08.046 --> 05:11.311
but people say I'm pretty nice,
so there's that.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.312
You know, they say

05:12.355 --> 05:13.748
a dog chooses his owner.

05:13.791 --> 05:14.836
I think King just chose you.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.838
Did you just choose me?

05:16.881 --> 05:18.318
Oh, I think that's a yes.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.799
: Heel... heel!

05:23.235 --> 05:24.236
Good girl.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.803
Don't worry, King.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.022
I won't make you
walk like that.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.328
Oh, you have a question
about walking?

05:29.894 --> 05:31.026
No, no, no.
I was just telling King...

05:31.069 --> 05:32.070
Owen!

05:32.114 --> 05:33.028
We've got a question
over here.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.899
Heel.

05:34.943 --> 05:35.813
No, no, I...

05:40.557 --> 05:42.167
Sorry, I, I...
I didn't.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.213
I don't have any questions,
but thank you...

05:45.345 --> 05:46.476
Owen.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.956
: Owen is
our amazing dog trainer,

05:47.999 --> 05:49.436
and Julia here
is looking to adopt.

05:49.479 --> 05:50.872
Am I right?

05:50.915 --> 05:53.440
Yes, if King will have me.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.442
Wow, congratulations
to you both,

05:55.485 --> 05:56.356
and if you do have
a question...

06:00.360 --> 06:03.101
Wow, you train rescue
and therapy dogs?

06:03.145 --> 06:04.799
Well, sometimes,
they're the same thing.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.670
Owen gives
complimentary training sessions

06:06.714 --> 06:08.411
for first-time adoptees,

06:08.455 --> 06:10.326
just to help them
with the transition.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.545
That's sweet, thanks,

06:11.588 --> 06:12.937
but I don't think
we're going to need it.

06:12.981 --> 06:13.982
Well, if you do...

06:14.025 --> 06:15.200
I have to be honest...

06:15.244 --> 06:16.593
I've read a few of the books,

06:16.637 --> 06:19.770
and they all just seem
a little too rigid for me.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.076
I already decided
I'm going to go

06:21.119 --> 06:23.252
with a "love is all you need"
approach.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.733
That's not a technique...

06:26.777 --> 06:28.126
and it's not.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.432
I'm sorry?

06:29.476 --> 06:30.477
It's not
all you need.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.434
You need to set
boundaries,

06:31.478 --> 06:33.175
establish guidelines.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.611
Yeah, but...

06:34.655 --> 06:35.656
there's also a lot more
to relationships

06:35.699 --> 06:36.526
than just giving orders,

06:36.570 --> 06:37.397
so...

06:40.312 --> 06:42.140
You're right.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.011
You need to set a schedule.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.840
You know what?
Right now,

06:45.883 --> 06:47.885
I think I really just want
to buy him a really cute bed.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.583
Great.

06:49.626 --> 06:52.063
We don't have to agree
on everything now,

06:52.107 --> 06:53.674
but we do like to go
the extra mile

06:53.717 --> 06:55.284
to make sure you're both happy
in your new home together,

06:55.327 --> 06:58.069
so we'll follow up
with a home visit in a few days.

06:58.113 --> 06:58.896
Great.

06:58.940 --> 06:59.897
Good.

07:05.729 --> 07:06.730
Okay!

07:06.774 --> 07:07.862
Come in.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.341
What're you doing, King?
Come on.

07:09.385 --> 07:10.908
Just a few more steps, buddy.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.433
You a little nervous?
It's okay. You're home now.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.304
Come on.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.610
Okay, just...
come on.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.525
Just a few more steps.
Yeah, there we go. Okay.

07:19.743 --> 07:20.744
Okay.

07:22.616 --> 07:23.443
All right, buddy.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.489
Look...

07:26.533 --> 07:28.491
I know change is tough,
all right?

07:28.535 --> 07:30.101
I can relate,
but we're home now, okay?

07:31.929 --> 07:33.583
Ooh, ooh!
Hold that thought.

07:33.627 --> 07:34.932
Okay.

07:39.676 --> 07:40.851
Hello?

07:40.895 --> 07:43.201
Yes, hi, Mr. Salas.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.725
It's so great
to hear from you, yeah.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.683
We'll just make it
10:00 instead.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.469
Okay, wonderful.
See you tomorrow.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.340
Okay.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.299
All right,
sorry about that, buddy.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.171
Um...

07:56.214 --> 07:57.259
So, do you want a tour?

07:57.302 --> 07:59.653
It's kind of
a short one, but, um...

07:59.696 --> 08:01.002
come on, follow me.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.483
Uh, this is my new office.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.140
Or I can just follow you.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.141
That works, too.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.457
Ah, here we go.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.112
I got this nice new bed.

08:26.288 --> 08:27.158
It's Velveteen.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.207
You can sleep here tonight,
if you want.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.035
I've got to go to work.
Enjoy your new bed.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.038
Right...

08:53.707 --> 08:54.925
I know it's late, King.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.014
But I've got a big pitch
tomorrow.

09:01.584 --> 09:02.716
You want to come up here?

09:05.719 --> 09:06.633
No?

09:08.373 --> 09:09.549
It's goose down.

09:11.507 --> 09:12.377
You more of a duck fan?

09:17.121 --> 09:17.992
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

09:21.299 --> 09:22.257
Okay.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.661
Are you sure
you do not mind taking him?

09:34.704 --> 09:36.314
I just don't want
to leave him alone.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.446
Are you kidding me?

09:37.489 --> 09:38.839
The fastest way
to get help anywhere

09:38.882 --> 09:40.318
is to bring a really cute dog.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.755
I'll get us our
swatches in no time.

09:41.798 --> 09:44.975
Okay, and I will call you
the second that I'm done.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.673
Don't worry about us.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.762
Just worry about
Wyatt Salas.

09:48.805 --> 09:49.893
Please,
I'm not worried.

09:49.937 --> 09:51.678
I'm...

09:51.721 --> 09:52.896
confident and shining

09:52.940 --> 09:56.030
and something else
very spiritual.

09:56.073 --> 09:58.075
"Perfect
just the way you are?"

09:58.119 --> 09:59.860
Yeah,
that sounds vaguely familiar.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.296
Good...

10:01.339 --> 10:03.124
'cause today could kind of
be a game changer.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.430
We're just pitching
one restaurant.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.693
Yeah, but Wyatt Salas
owns 20,

10:06.736 --> 10:07.607
so you know what that means.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.740
Are you trying
to make me feel better or worse?

10:10.784 --> 10:12.699
Right.

10:12.742 --> 10:13.613
You're going to kill it.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.093
So go.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.486
Okay.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.443
All right, King,
wish me luck.

10:19.488 --> 10:20.315
Oh!

10:21.272 --> 10:22.883
Aw...

10:22.926 --> 10:24.145
I'll take that
as good luck.

10:24.188 --> 10:25.102
All right.

10:25.146 --> 10:26.321
'Kay.

10:30.891 --> 10:31.935
You're right,

10:31.979 --> 10:33.720
the restaurant business
is brutal.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.765
That's why I usually work
with established firms

10:35.809 --> 10:36.897
on my buildings,

10:36.940 --> 10:38.420
especially on something

10:38.463 --> 10:40.335
as crucial
as a restaurant relaunch.

10:40.378 --> 10:43.468
Yes, and I appreciate
you giving us a shot.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.992
Well, you were always
one of my favorites

10:45.035 --> 10:45.993
at Baluster Bay...

10:47.472 --> 10:49.518
but honestly,

10:49.561 --> 10:51.128
you think you can handle
this project on your own?

10:51.172 --> 10:52.739
Oh, it's not just me.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.089
There's also my junior designer,
Sherry McRay,

10:55.132 --> 10:58.440
and if I was your favorite,
you will be in great hands.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.963
One of my favorites.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.530
Right.

11:03.750 --> 11:07.492
Well, I realize we may not be
what you're used to scale wise,

11:07.536 --> 11:09.625
but we will give you
everything we've got.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
Well, you've got two people.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.020
Two very talented people

11:13.063 --> 11:15.675
with no one else to focus on...
yet.

11:17.024 --> 11:18.199
We can handle it.

11:25.423 --> 11:28.122
"Two very talented people."

11:28.165 --> 11:29.732
Ugh.

11:29.776 --> 11:30.994
That didn't sound desperate
at all.

11:32.953 --> 11:33.867
You know what?
No.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.956
I'm not going to doom us.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.306
It started off good,
and then...

11:38.349 --> 11:39.699
I should've just said
you were a new hire.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.874
It would've made us
sound bigger.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.224
You hungry?

11:48.403 --> 11:49.665
Oh, okay.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.927
Do you want a treat?

11:50.971 --> 11:52.407
All right.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.236
We've got salmon...

11:55.279 --> 11:56.759
or peanut butter.

11:56.803 --> 11:57.717
You pick.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.851
Okay, peanut butter it is.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.376
All right.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.595
Here you go, King.

12:09.598 --> 12:10.555
Really?

12:12.035 --> 12:13.776
Whatever you do,
please look happy.

12:13.820 --> 12:14.734
Please, please.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.436
Hi! Sorry.

12:21.479 --> 12:22.785
You're not Molly.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.700
No. Why, did they tell you
that she was coming?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.050
Uh...
they didn't say she wasn't,

12:27.094 --> 12:29.618
so I guess
I just kind of assumed.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.750
Sorry,
Stuck with me.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.404
Can I come in?

12:34.492 --> 12:36.233
Yes.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.757
Yes, come on in.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.113
Hey, buddy!

12:46.156 --> 12:47.244
How are you, King?

12:49.725 --> 12:51.553
So, how's it going?

12:51.596 --> 12:52.946
Oh, you know.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.556
Work's been kind of crazy,

12:54.599 --> 12:57.124
but that's to be expected
with a new business, so...

12:58.168 --> 12:59.082
I meant with King.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.869
Right. Of course.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.087
Uh...

13:04.131 --> 13:06.698
It's going well...
I mean, pretty well.

13:06.742 --> 13:07.743
Pretty well?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.136
Yeah, yeah.
Well enough.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.138
We're just kind of warming up
to each other.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.966
So what's your routine?

13:13.009 --> 13:14.358
I'm sorry?

13:14.402 --> 13:15.620
When do you get up?

13:15.664 --> 13:18.188
Eat? Walk? Play?

13:18.232 --> 13:20.103
It's all just
kind of in there.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.104
In where?

13:21.148 --> 13:22.453
Are you always
this inquisitive?

13:22.497 --> 13:24.542
I'm just trying
to get the full picture here.

13:24.586 --> 13:27.154
Which I appreciate,

13:27.197 --> 13:29.504
but I'm not going to force
all this structure on him.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.201
Like I said, I'm going
with an all love approach.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.681
Is it working?

13:32.724 --> 13:33.682
Mostly.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.424
Well,
you do look pretty happy.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.642
Told you.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.862
You're good?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.342
You don't need any help?

13:41.385 --> 13:42.560
You mean with training?

13:42.604 --> 13:43.997
No. Mm-mm.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.128
You feel in control?

13:45.172 --> 13:46.303
Totally.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.827
Okay.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.132
Great.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.831
All right.
I'll just head...

13:54.572 --> 13:55.486
Uh, sorry.
Can I, um...

13:57.837 --> 13:59.142
Can I just give you
a quick tip?

13:59.186 --> 14:00.448
Oh, is this
my free lesson?

14:00.491 --> 14:01.666
Make him sit for it.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.972
What?

14:03.016 --> 14:04.756
The treat.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.280
King's a pleaser,
but he's also spirited.

14:06.323 --> 14:07.759
He needs to feel
like he's earned it.

14:07.803 --> 14:08.848
That's the only way
he's going to know

14:08.891 --> 14:09.718
the order of things
in his new home.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.459
Just try this.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.373
Sit.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.333
Good boy.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.511
Have a nice night.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.432
Work for treats?

14:28.476 --> 14:29.564
You don't need
to work for treats.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.308
Do you?

14:35.483 --> 14:36.353
Okay, but just for fun.

14:38.660 --> 14:39.574
Sit.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.056
What am I doing wrong?

14:45.493 --> 14:46.407
Sit?

14:48.017 --> 14:49.889
Do you want the salmon?
Okay.

15:01.204 --> 15:02.379
Hey, why are you so worried?

15:02.423 --> 15:03.859
You said that
the meeting went great.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.295
I didn't say great.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.470
I said good,

15:06.514 --> 15:07.602
and I don't even know
how good it went

15:07.645 --> 15:08.429
considering he hasn't
called me yet.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.171
But maybe that's because
you're strangling your phone.

15:13.564 --> 15:14.522
You're right.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.046
I'm going to call him.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.918
Good.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.095
: Hello?

15:22.138 --> 15:23.923
Hello, Mr. Salas?
It's Julia Galvins calling.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.881
I was just about
to call you.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.187
I was sensing that.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.972
Uh, see?
We're already in sync.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.191
I really enjoyed
your pitch...

15:31.234 --> 15:32.670
That is great to hear

15:32.714 --> 15:35.064
because I've been thinking
about your space, nonstop.

15:35.108 --> 15:38.285
But I'm going to have to go
in another direction.

15:38.328 --> 15:39.286
Oh.

15:42.463 --> 15:43.594
I actually feel

15:43.638 --> 15:44.726
I was prepared
to lead this project,

15:44.769 --> 15:46.946
but thank you
for letting us know.

15:48.643 --> 15:49.949
Bye.

15:54.605 --> 15:57.130
I'm sorry
I couldn't close the deal.

15:59.045 --> 15:59.959
You know what?

16:01.656 --> 16:02.744
I think
it's actually good luck

16:02.787 --> 16:05.138
not to book your first pitch.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.010
Really?

16:08.054 --> 16:10.099
I still get benefits, right?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.799
I don't know
what I was thinking, King.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.018
I can't compete.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.367
I mean, I get it.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.412
I'd probably hire
a more established company, too.

16:18.455 --> 16:19.804
I just...

16:19.848 --> 16:21.458
just thought,
with our history, you know,

16:21.502 --> 16:22.459
but...

16:23.547 --> 16:24.461
Come on, King.

16:24.505 --> 16:26.115
Throw me a bone.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.769
Bad pun. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

16:27.812 --> 16:29.814
Okay, please.

16:29.858 --> 16:30.859
If I don't make it
to the dry cleaners

16:30.902 --> 16:31.903
in the next 10 minutes,

16:31.947 --> 16:33.557
I'm going to have
nothing to wear,

16:33.601 --> 16:34.471
and I'm pretty sure that's not
going to help my cause, so...

16:34.515 --> 16:35.472
come on.

16:35.516 --> 16:36.778
Please?

16:36.821 --> 16:37.648
Who's walking who?

16:38.867 --> 16:40.086
Thank you, sir.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.305
That's very helpful.
I feel much better now.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.786
Can I give your dog
a treat?

16:46.353 --> 16:47.702
Yeah, it's real hit or miss,
but sure.

16:47.745 --> 16:48.746
Yeah, you can try.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.704
Sit.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.359
Stay.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.101
Now shake.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.015
Oh, no, he doesn't shake...

16:58.887 --> 17:00.149
Good boy!

17:05.936 --> 17:06.851
Seriously?

17:10.724 --> 17:11.769
Up!

17:11.813 --> 17:13.162
I'm just curious

17:13.205 --> 17:15.121
how much your commercial space
runs for, roughly?

17:15.164 --> 17:16.296
I'm thinking
for the right price,

17:16.339 --> 17:17.906
my partner might actually
consider moving.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.561
I'm sorry, it's how much?

17:21.605 --> 17:23.215
Um, yeah, uh...

17:23.259 --> 17:24.955
okay, Mom!
All right.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.435
Bye.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.307
Hi.

17:27.349 --> 17:28.656
Hey!

17:28.699 --> 17:31.093
Maybe just one session
couldn't hurt,

17:31.137 --> 17:32.964
but...

17:33.008 --> 17:34.923
I still want
to lead with love.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.231
Uh, yeah.

17:38.274 --> 17:39.493
I'll try to work that
into the schedule.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.540
'Kay.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.332
So, are you looking
for an express package,

17:52.375 --> 17:53.202
or something more in-depth?

17:53.246 --> 17:54.856
Uh...

17:54.899 --> 17:56.423
I'm not really sure.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.120
I think she's just looking
for a few tips.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.252
Am I right?

17:59.295 --> 18:00.296
That would be great, yes.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.168
Well, he only has
about 30 minutes

18:02.211 --> 18:03.560
before our lunch meeting...

18:03.604 --> 18:04.561
Perfect.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.435
Yeah, sure.

18:08.478 --> 18:09.610
We can do a quick assessment,
see where you're at,

18:09.653 --> 18:11.307
and we'll go
from there.

18:11.351 --> 18:12.700
Where I'm at,
like, mentally?

18:12.743 --> 18:15.137
'Cause this is probably
not the best week to ask.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.704
No, I, um...

18:16.747 --> 18:17.618
meant with the dog.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.446
Just simple commands.

18:19.489 --> 18:22.536
Sit, stay... come.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.190
Yes.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.323
Yes, you're comfortable
with them?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.673
Comfy-ish.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.240
Great.
Let's see them.

18:31.284 --> 18:32.372
Okay.

18:34.939 --> 18:35.810
So...

18:38.073 --> 18:39.030
Right. So...

18:39.074 --> 18:39.988
Sit.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.122
Sit?

18:46.386 --> 18:47.387
Sit!

18:52.479 --> 18:53.610
Okay, let's keep going.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.308
Right.
Here goes...

18:56.961 --> 18:57.962
Stay.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.229
You actually have to walk away.

19:04.578 --> 19:05.709
Why?

19:05.753 --> 19:06.884
Well, it's the only way
to gauge

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
if the dog's
actually listening to you,

19:08.495 --> 19:11.672
or if he's just staying put
because that's where he is.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.195
Simple, one-word phrases.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.023
I'll try.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.024
That was two words.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.507
Stay.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.640
Stay...

19:27.035 --> 19:28.471
You have to go
where he can't see you,

19:28.515 --> 19:30.865
just where he hears your voice.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.780
Well, that sounds
like a trick, but...

19:32.823 --> 19:33.694
I'll do it.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.349
Stay.

19:43.094 --> 19:43.878
Okay, come!

19:43.921 --> 19:45.706
Hi!

19:47.011 --> 19:48.012
Yeah, nice try.

19:49.492 --> 19:50.406
Doesn't count, does it?

19:50.450 --> 19:52.191
Not so much.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.540
Don't worry about it.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.759
We can work on this
more in-depth on Saturday.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.761
Until then, just keep
the commands simple.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.068
Sit. Stay. Come.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.243
Easy. Done.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.462
Are those
your simple commands?

20:02.505 --> 20:03.724
I'm here all night.

20:05.334 --> 20:06.379
All right, well,

20:06.422 --> 20:07.423
until Saturday...

20:07.467 --> 20:09.077
and remember,

20:09.120 --> 20:10.034
you're the alpha.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.297
Right.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.347
Maybe I'll take a quick peek
at the express package.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.307
Sure.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.575
I might still be
in my sweats,

20:28.618 --> 20:30.620
but I'm going
to turn this ship around.

20:30.664 --> 20:31.969
Who's next?

20:32.013 --> 20:32.970
Atta girl.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.189
Just make sure

20:34.233 --> 20:34.972
that there's something
left for me to do

20:35.016 --> 20:35.973
when I get back.

20:36.017 --> 20:37.148
Oh, hey, remember,

20:37.192 --> 20:37.975
all we need to do
is fill the sample book,

20:38.019 --> 20:38.976
not overload it.

20:39.020 --> 20:40.587
Whatever gets us business.

20:42.893 --> 20:43.764
Right.

20:45.461 --> 20:46.506
Okay.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.510
Breathe in.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.120
Breathe out.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.343
Something
about a river and a wave.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.433
It only takes one,
right, King?

21:07.483 --> 21:09.964
You've reached 555-2825.

21:10.007 --> 21:11.008
Please leave a message.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.575
Hi. This is Julia Galvins.

21:12.619 --> 21:13.924
Uh, we met last year.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.056
I was on the design team

21:15.099 --> 21:16.753
for the Margowsky Library
renovations.

21:16.797 --> 21:17.841
What?

21:17.885 --> 21:18.973
We just went out.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.454
I...

21:24.283 --> 21:25.762
I was calling
to let you know

21:25.806 --> 21:27.460
that I started
my own design studio,

21:27.503 --> 21:28.678
Julia Galvins Designs,

21:28.722 --> 21:29.592
so if you need anything,
please...

21:29.636 --> 21:30.593
What?

21:30.637 --> 21:31.681
Sit. Sit!

21:31.725 --> 21:32.813
Shh!

21:34.162 --> 21:35.468
Better yet,
why don't I just call you back?

21:38.166 --> 21:41.082
Okay, that barking right there
was not okay.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.912
What's up, King, huh?

21:44.955 --> 21:46.783
Do you want to shake?

21:46.827 --> 21:48.437
No?
What's going on?

21:50.439 --> 21:51.701
You want to go outside?

21:51.745 --> 21:53.355
All right, fine.
Grab your keys.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.661
Let's go.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.406
This what you needed, boy?
Huh?

22:07.413 --> 22:08.414
Okay, King.

22:08.457 --> 22:11.286
You can run now, play.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.028
You can show off
that new fancy collar.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.303
Aren't you adorable?

22:28.347 --> 22:30.653
Hi!

22:30.697 --> 22:31.698
I hope
she's not bothering you.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.353
No, no, not at all.
She's a charmer.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.486
King's just a little shy.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.445
I don't know.
It might be his new collar.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.143
Do you think it looks
too much like a necklace?

22:42.186 --> 22:43.100
I think it's perfect.

22:43.144 --> 22:44.711
- Yeah.
- And don't worry.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.147
Ginger's
a social butterfly.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.149
She'll make him her new
best friend in minutes.

22:50.325 --> 22:51.370
Oop!
There they go.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.067
Yeah.

22:53.110 --> 22:55.156
I hope I look that good
in my third trimester.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.071
You're expecting puppies?

22:57.114 --> 22:59.290
Sorry, she's expecting puppies?

22:59.334 --> 23:01.858
You're clearly expecting
babies, or a baby.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.556
One baby.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.645
Ginger's actually due
in four weeks,

23:05.688 --> 23:06.515
and I have three months to go.

23:07.777 --> 23:08.822
But I work from home,

23:08.865 --> 23:11.346
so I can just, you know,
relax into it.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.044
And wear sweat pants
all day.

23:14.088 --> 23:15.394
Sweats?

23:15.437 --> 23:16.873
Sorry, or not.

23:16.917 --> 23:18.135
I, uh,

23:18.179 --> 23:19.615
I just recently started
working from home,

23:19.659 --> 23:21.835
so it feels
like a perk to me.

23:21.878 --> 23:23.314
What do you do from home?

23:23.358 --> 23:24.707
I'm an interior designer.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.535
I actually used to work
for Baluster Bay,

23:26.579 --> 23:28.363
but I recently just started
my own design studio,

23:28.407 --> 23:30.670
and yeah, it's been fun,

23:30.713 --> 23:32.411
but I'm clearly projecting
my own personal style

23:32.454 --> 23:33.977
onto my dog.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.675
I'm Julia Galvins.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.285
Oh, Cassie Guggenheim.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.373
So nice to meet you.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.200
Nice to meet you
as well.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.553
This may be
a little bit small scale,

23:44.597 --> 23:46.729
but my husband and I are
actually looking for a designer

23:46.773 --> 23:48.122
for the nursery.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.950
Oh, my gosh!
I love nurseries.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.430
You do?

23:51.473 --> 23:52.996
Yes, yes, I love babies.
I'm definitely a baby person.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.215
In fact,
a lot of my best friends are...

23:55.477 --> 23:56.739
babies?

23:56.783 --> 23:58.262
Why don't I send you
some photos of the space,

23:58.306 --> 23:59.176
and we'll just go from there?

23:59.220 --> 24:01.004
Sound good?

24:01.048 --> 24:03.616
It sounds like I should go
to the dog park more often.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.095
Here's my card.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.575
Perfect.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.664
I'll call your office,
and I'll set up a time.

24:08.708 --> 24:09.709
Great!

24:09.752 --> 24:11.493
Great.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.452
Okay, sweetie,
let's go get you some treats.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.453
Time to get pampered.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.107
It was nice to meet you.
I hope to hear from you.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.152
You bet.

24:25.942 --> 24:27.335
Was this all
part of your master plan?

24:29.206 --> 24:30.556
If it was, thanks.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.783
Any ideas for a nursery, King?

24:43.090 --> 24:45.135
What about, like,
a magical forest,

24:45.179 --> 24:46.180
or...

24:47.877 --> 24:48.835
What's up?

24:48.878 --> 24:50.967
You sleepy?

24:52.229 --> 24:53.100
Do you want to come up here?

24:54.841 --> 24:55.798
Still no?

24:55.842 --> 24:57.931
Okay.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.149
Just close your eyes, buddy.

25:00.977 --> 25:02.936
Do you want me
to close my eyes first?

25:04.415 --> 25:05.373
Okay.

25:07.462 --> 25:08.507
How's that?

25:15.949 --> 25:17.559
Don't worry.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.822
We're going to figure this out.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.389
I promise.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.443
I know it's only
a four-week course,

25:32.487 --> 25:34.358
but I thought we'd be
a little bit more hands on,

25:34.402 --> 25:35.490
down and dirty.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.665
That's why I wore this.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.101
Well, every owner and dog
is different,

25:38.145 --> 25:39.929
so every session
will be different.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.192
I just don't understand
how shopping's going to help.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.237
He won't sleep.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.673
I mean he slept
a little, but...

25:44.717 --> 25:46.501
it's like
he just can't relax.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.589
That's why we're here.

25:47.633 --> 25:49.678
But I already
bought him a bed.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.854
So much of this is
about how you feel.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.682
Well, I feel
pretty ready to work.

25:53.726 --> 25:55.815
Great. Well...

25:55.858 --> 25:57.077
let's start by putting this...

25:59.253 --> 26:00.080
in your basket.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.083
You want me
to buy a fanny pack?

26:03.126 --> 26:04.563
That's a treat trainer.

26:05.955 --> 26:07.391
It's a fanny pack.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.350
I will put it back
in the basket,

26:09.393 --> 26:10.960
but I'm not convinced.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.571
Okay.
Let's pick a toy.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.574
Which one?

26:15.617 --> 26:16.444
Well, which one
do you think he'd like?

26:16.487 --> 26:17.793
I don't even know

26:17.837 --> 26:19.273
what kind of treats
he likes best yet.

26:19.316 --> 26:20.448
I think you're putting
a bit too much pressure on this.

26:20.491 --> 26:23.233
Just pick any toy.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.193
Okay...

26:26.236 --> 26:27.847
this one looks fun.

26:27.890 --> 26:29.588
All right.
Classic choice...

26:29.631 --> 26:30.545
and I'll pick this one.

26:31.677 --> 26:33.113
Now, why don't you jog

26:33.156 --> 26:33.940
all the way down
to the end of the aisle.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.073
Sit.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.640
Stay.

26:38.684 --> 26:39.902
All right.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.556
Now...

26:41.600 --> 26:42.252
put your toy up in the air...

26:42.296 --> 26:43.253
Okay.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.298
And shake.

26:49.129 --> 26:50.739
Ah!

26:50.783 --> 26:52.306
He likes the squirrel!

26:52.349 --> 26:53.437
Let's trade.

26:56.963 --> 26:59.052
Good boy. Sit.

26:59.095 --> 27:00.619
Sit!

27:00.662 --> 27:02.359
And stay.

27:02.403 --> 27:03.752
All right.

27:03.796 --> 27:05.014
Let's do it again.
Lift your toy in the air...

27:05.058 --> 27:06.102
and shake!

27:10.629 --> 27:12.500
Okay, so...
now he likes the dragon?

27:12.543 --> 27:14.023
What's the constant here?

27:14.067 --> 27:15.677
He definitely wants a toy.

27:15.721 --> 27:18.593
He wants whatever
toy you have

27:18.637 --> 27:19.812
because you're the one
playing with him.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.248
Look, I know you want
to lead with love,

27:21.291 --> 27:22.945
but if you lead
with confidence,

27:22.989 --> 27:24.991
everything else is just
going to fall into place,

27:25.034 --> 27:27.080
and he's going to choose you
every time.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.084
All right, well,

27:31.127 --> 27:32.651
then I'm going to get him
the squirrel and the dragon,

27:32.694 --> 27:34.304
because if he loves me so much,
he deserves to be spoiled...

27:34.348 --> 27:36.567
but, uh...

27:36.611 --> 27:38.526
look, do I really need
to get this?

27:38.569 --> 27:40.267
Do you want to be
the alpha, or not?

27:50.364 --> 27:51.713
You checked
the wood samples?

27:51.757 --> 27:53.149
'Cause I just want to make sure

27:53.193 --> 27:54.063
she understands the texture
that we're going for.

27:54.107 --> 27:56.022
Done. Checked.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.199
I am leading with confidence.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.463
Yeah, is that another gem
from the meditation app?

28:03.769 --> 28:05.161
Or your cute trainer?

28:05.205 --> 28:06.902
What?
I don't have a cute trainer.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.077
Okay, sure, you don't.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.078
King does.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.514
I saw his card.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.040
Okay, for starters,
he's not cute.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.389
He's just...

28:15.432 --> 28:16.912
in shape,

28:16.956 --> 28:18.522
and even if he was,
I wouldn't notice,

28:18.566 --> 28:20.133
because what do I always say?

28:20.176 --> 28:21.351
Cookie batter is real food?

28:21.395 --> 28:23.223
And...

28:23.266 --> 28:25.791
career before love,
you're in the clear.

28:26.922 --> 28:29.229
Love before career,
you're just distracted.

28:29.272 --> 28:32.145
I'm not really sure that
that is how that saying goes,

28:32.188 --> 28:33.581
but I do like your focus.

28:34.669 --> 28:35.670
How do I look?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.498
Not at all intimidated
by Cassie.

28:39.282 --> 28:41.154
That's because
I'm ignoring the Internet,

28:41.197 --> 28:42.285
unlike you.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.634
Yeah, that doesn't
change the fact

28:43.678 --> 28:45.071
that she is
a major philanthropist

28:45.114 --> 28:46.637
who sits on the board
of practically every nonprofit

28:46.681 --> 28:47.726
in Portland.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.597
She was lovely.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.165
Still, her connections
are kind of everything.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.036
Okay, you know what?

28:54.080 --> 28:55.429
I'm going to stop
asking you questions.

28:56.735 --> 28:57.692
All right, King.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.087
Sit.

29:03.785 --> 29:04.786
Good boy.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.135
See?

29:06.179 --> 29:08.181
Look at all that confidence.

29:08.224 --> 29:09.269
Beautiful.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.358
Hey, Julia?

29:11.401 --> 29:12.533
Yeah?

29:12.576 --> 29:14.753
I would take off
the fanny pack first.

29:20.019 --> 29:20.933
Oh, my gosh.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.733
So, are you ready to wow us?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.126
Absolutely.

29:40.169 --> 29:41.692
Here we go.

29:41.736 --> 29:44.304
One of the most important things
to foster in a child

29:44.347 --> 29:45.827
is imagination.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.437
That's why I want
to turn your nursery

29:47.481 --> 29:49.962
into a magical forest

29:50.005 --> 29:52.225
to engage
your child's sense of wonder.

29:52.268 --> 29:53.704
Imagine your child
waking up,

29:53.748 --> 29:55.794
being surrounded by trees.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.404
Three of the walls
will have delicate murals

29:57.447 --> 29:59.319
depicting a tranquil forest.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.842
I love that.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.409
Mm... and what about
the fourth wall?

30:02.452 --> 30:03.540
It'll be a bookcase

30:03.584 --> 30:05.107
for your child's
favorite books...

30:05.151 --> 30:08.589
stories that will transport her
to fantastical places,

30:08.632 --> 30:11.374
and we'll use
various branches and textiles

30:11.418 --> 30:13.159
to bring it all together
in an organic way.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.683
Here, feel these,
for example.

30:20.296 --> 30:21.254
Oh, I don't know
about you,

30:21.297 --> 30:22.429
but I really love this.

30:22.472 --> 30:24.126
: It does sound
pretty impressive.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.127
Oh, I'm so glad.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.346
I have to admit,

30:26.389 --> 30:28.261
'cause I was
just a little bit nervous...

30:28.304 --> 30:29.610
But I don't like to make
any decisions on the spot.

30:29.653 --> 30:30.567
Right, hon'?

30:30.611 --> 30:32.569
You don't.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.136
He doesn't.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.964
Yeah, no, I...

30:36.008 --> 30:37.487
I totally understand.

30:37.531 --> 30:38.619
Um...

30:38.662 --> 30:40.229
I mean,
it's a very big decision,

30:40.273 --> 30:42.275
and I'm new,
we're new,

30:42.318 --> 30:43.929
so... so there's that.

30:43.972 --> 30:44.973
Well, great.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.322
We'll look it
all over tonight,

30:46.366 --> 30:47.541
and get back to you,

30:47.584 --> 30:49.064
but it's all great.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.936
No rush.
No rush at all.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.000
Still nothing.

31:13.349 --> 31:14.350
Great.

31:14.394 --> 31:15.743
Come on.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.142
Hi. This is Julia Galvins.

31:23.185 --> 31:24.926
I was calling to see
if you got my message.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.233
If you need any design work,
please call us back,

31:27.276 --> 31:28.538
'cause we are here for you.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.194
Anything from Cassie?

31:33.979 --> 31:36.242
Not since you last asked
10 minutes ago.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.076
I mean...
dogs can't talk,

31:44.119 --> 31:45.381
so you've got to be
pretty intuitive, right?

31:45.425 --> 31:46.426
As a trainer?

31:46.469 --> 31:48.210
I try to be, yeah.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.473
So then, do you think
it's a bad sign?

31:50.517 --> 31:51.431
Do I think
what's a bad sign?

31:51.474 --> 31:54.216
Ah, make him sit
before we cross.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.914
Okay, King, sit.

31:55.957 --> 31:58.438
Good boy.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.355
That she hasn't called.
It's been, like, 43 hours.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.052
Well, that depends.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.401
On what?

32:05.445 --> 32:06.707
If you're counting
the seconds.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.796
Wait, are you trying
to be funny?

32:08.839 --> 32:09.884
That was a bad joke.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.190
No, no.

32:11.233 --> 32:12.234
Look, normally,
I would love them,

32:12.278 --> 32:13.453
but I'm just...

32:13.496 --> 32:14.758
I'm feeling
a little stressed right now.

32:14.802 --> 32:15.977
You know, it's not just me,
it's Sherry, too,

32:16.021 --> 32:17.805
and I don't...
I don't want to let her down.

32:17.848 --> 32:18.937
I don't think you will.

32:18.980 --> 32:19.938
Okay.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.507
Um...

32:24.551 --> 32:26.770
let's, uh, let's head back.

32:26.814 --> 32:28.163
I thought we were walking
all the way to the park?

32:28.207 --> 32:29.730
No, I...
I don't think we need to.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.427
You're looking solid.

32:34.953 --> 32:35.997
Okay.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.956
Look, I just...

32:37.999 --> 32:39.000
I just think
she would've called by now

32:39.044 --> 32:40.480
if it was good news,
you know?

32:42.786 --> 32:45.050
You know what?
Hand me your phone.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.486
What?

32:46.529 --> 32:47.922
After today, we only have
two more sessions left,

32:47.966 --> 32:49.837
so if you're going
to get your money's worth,

32:49.880 --> 32:51.360
I need your full focus.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.275
I am totally...

32:53.319 --> 32:54.973
not focused.

32:58.802 --> 32:59.847
Come on.

33:06.506 --> 33:07.898
All right.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.770
I want to work
on communication.

33:09.813 --> 33:10.945
Actually, King's getting
pretty good

33:10.989 --> 33:11.772
at the whole "sit" thing.

33:11.815 --> 33:13.904
No, your communication.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.471
We need to work
on your voice.

33:15.515 --> 33:16.907
We do?

33:16.951 --> 33:21.129
Yeah, it's...
sweet and soft,

33:21.173 --> 33:24.698
and you have
this quirky little twang

33:24.741 --> 33:25.916
that I kind of like.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.309
Thank you.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.267
But it's ineffective.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.529
Oh.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.531
A command should be,
as its name implies...

33:31.574 --> 33:32.488
commanding.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.797
You should be clear,
firm, authoritative.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.061
It doesn't have to be hard
or angry,

33:40.105 --> 33:41.584
just... committed.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.325
Okay.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.979
Exactly.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.199
The more commanding you are,
the more successful you'll be.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.767
Well, I, uh...

33:50.811 --> 33:52.291
I don't feel
real successful right now,

33:52.334 --> 33:53.379
in general.

33:53.422 --> 33:54.815
Well, maybe that's the problem.

33:56.947 --> 33:58.297
If you don't feel
like you're in control.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.038
He certainly won't
think you are.

34:01.517 --> 34:02.866
Now, I want you to give this
to King...

34:04.912 --> 34:06.087
and I want you
to pull on the other end

34:06.131 --> 34:07.001
and say "Give!"

34:09.134 --> 34:10.873
Here. Give.

34:10.918 --> 34:12.224
Give!

34:12.266 --> 34:13.833
: If you say
his name strongly,

34:13.877 --> 34:14.835
to get his attention,

34:14.878 --> 34:16.184
and then say the command.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.099
Yeah, I don't want him
to think I'm mad at him.

34:18.143 --> 34:19.231
He won't.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.232
Dogs are very perceptive.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.407
They know
how you're feeling

34:21.449 --> 34:23.277
based on your body
language.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.715
Your voice is used to tell them
what it is you want them to do.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.763
Okay. Fine.

34:29.806 --> 34:30.719
King, here.

34:32.025 --> 34:33.766
King, give!

34:33.810 --> 34:35.290
Ah!

34:35.333 --> 34:36.509
- Huh?
- It worked.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.163
Okay.
Give him some praise.

34:38.206 --> 34:40.078
Ooh, who's a good boy?

34:40.121 --> 34:41.601
Who's a good boy?

34:41.643 --> 34:44.168
Now, praise should always
be happy, upbeat, assuring.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.996
Basically,
your natural voice.

34:47.041 --> 34:48.389
Definitely better
at that part.

34:49.956 --> 34:51.437
I think you're better
at most things than you think.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.355
Hey, you should come with us
to lunch.

34:57.791 --> 34:58.879
Who, you and Cindy?

34:58.922 --> 34:59.967
Yeah, I mean,
it's dog friendly.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.536
I think it'll help get
your mind off of things.

35:03.579 --> 35:04.754
Well, thanks for the invite,

35:04.798 --> 35:06.713
but I don't want
to crash your lunch date.

35:06.756 --> 35:09.759
I have been the third wheel
plenty of times.

35:09.803 --> 35:10.847
Oh, don't worry,

35:10.891 --> 35:11.892
her husband's
already doing that.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.243
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.984
You guys just...
you guys seem so close.

35:17.027 --> 35:18.812
That's because we've been
friends since college.

35:20.509 --> 35:21.728
So, what do you say?

35:21.771 --> 35:23.121
Will there be four wheels
at lunch?

35:25.253 --> 35:26.211
Yeah.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.654
: You know,
talk about routine.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.438
Pizza and a movie,
every Friday night

35:36.482 --> 35:38.179
since our senior year
in college.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.137
Even when you guys
were single?

35:39.180 --> 35:40.616
Especially
when we were single.

35:40.660 --> 35:41.574
Right, Owen?

35:43.271 --> 35:44.751
He's always been
the organized one, even then.

35:44.794 --> 35:48.450
I'd like to say loyal
to our Friday nights.

35:48.494 --> 35:51.236
Except when you bailed on us
with fake laryngitis.

35:51.279 --> 35:52.715
Hey, that worked out,
didn't it?

35:52.759 --> 35:54.326
What worked out?

35:55.805 --> 35:57.764
Owen pretended to be sick
one Friday night

35:57.807 --> 35:59.113
so we'd hang out alone.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.680
He sensed this
before we did.

36:01.768 --> 36:02.856
Thanks, buddy.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.640
Don't say I never did
anything for you.

36:04.684 --> 36:05.946
Owen,

36:05.989 --> 36:07.730
that is surprisingly
sentimental from you.

36:07.774 --> 36:09.993
Well, don't hold it against me.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.908
Or let him fool you.

36:11.952 --> 36:15.608
This man spends his day
surrounded by cute, cuddly dogs.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.262
Underneath his love
of structure...

36:17.305 --> 36:18.437
total softy.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.222
All right. Okay.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.310
Did we want
to order the nachos,

36:22.354 --> 36:23.833
maybe share them?

36:23.877 --> 36:25.531
So Owen said you started
your own design firm.

36:25.574 --> 36:26.793
Yeah, I...

36:26.836 --> 36:28.186
Yeah, she actually...

36:28.229 --> 36:29.752
she designed the rooftop garden
at the Parker Tower.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.493
Are you serious?

36:31.537 --> 36:33.495
I worked on it
at my last design firm,

36:33.539 --> 36:35.584
so not all me, but...

36:35.628 --> 36:38.196
Still, I love that space.
It's so serene.

36:38.239 --> 36:39.153
Thank you.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.330
So, are we ready to order?

36:45.115 --> 36:46.682
Is someone's phone vibrating?

36:46.726 --> 36:48.467
Oh.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.033
Yeah, sorry,
I have to get this.

36:50.077 --> 36:51.731
Excuse me.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.388
Hi, Cassie.

36:56.431 --> 36:57.824
So do you guys want
to share the nachos,

36:57.867 --> 36:59.478
or...

36:59.521 --> 37:00.566
what?

37:01.741 --> 37:04.004
So... this is fun.

37:04.047 --> 37:05.092
She seems really nice.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.267
She's a client...

37:06.311 --> 37:08.051
Mm.

37:08.095 --> 37:09.444
And she was having
a rough day, so...

37:09.488 --> 37:11.968
So you asked
her to lunch?

37:12.012 --> 37:14.057
It was a friendly gesture.

37:15.581 --> 37:16.756
- Sure.
- Sure.

37:18.453 --> 37:20.020
You do still remember
what a date looks like,

37:20.063 --> 37:21.239
don't you?

37:21.282 --> 37:23.066
Look, just because
I took a little time off

37:23.110 --> 37:24.154
doesn't mean a thing.

37:24.198 --> 37:26.026
Is two years little?

37:26.069 --> 37:27.201
Hmm, no.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.290
All right, you see this?
This whole thing?

37:29.334 --> 37:31.161
You can't do it
two-against-one.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.251
Hey, you're the one
who set us up.

37:36.297 --> 37:39.257
Sorry, I think
I have to go.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.693
Why, what happened?
You get the job?

37:40.736 --> 37:42.999
Uh, she said she's looking
at other designers, so...

37:43.043 --> 37:44.087
Oh.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.175
Sorry.

37:45.219 --> 37:46.351
No, don't be.

37:46.394 --> 37:47.439
It's totally normal.

37:47.482 --> 37:49.005
To be expected, actually,

37:49.049 --> 37:51.530
but... thank you
for this.

37:51.573 --> 37:52.531
I had fun,
and, um...

37:52.574 --> 37:53.967
it was nice
to meet you.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.449
Come on.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.415
What about
the buffalo wings?

38:07.459 --> 38:08.938
We could get both
and share.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.288
: Mm, yeah.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.637
Tangy or hot?

38:25.694 --> 38:27.783
What... is... that?

38:31.352 --> 38:32.745
Oh, okay.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.355
All right,
all right, buddy.

38:34.399 --> 38:35.965
I'm up.
Thank you.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.888
Whoa. Hey, come on.
We were doing so good.

38:45.932 --> 38:46.933
Whoa, whoa! Come on!

38:46.976 --> 38:47.890
Slow down.
Slow down, buddy.

38:47.934 --> 38:48.978
Where's the fire?
Come on.

38:49.022 --> 38:49.805
Oh, that's a wrong turn
of phrase.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.072
Hey, I'm so glad you're back.

38:56.116 --> 38:59.075
Yeah, well, King clearly knows I
have nowhere to be

38:59.119 --> 39:00.076
because he was determined
to come home.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.251
My guess is that...

39:01.295 --> 39:02.731
Your new client is here.

39:02.775 --> 39:03.819
I'm sorry, my what?

39:06.822 --> 39:08.346
Maybe
I should have called first.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.748
Is it weird
that I feel weird without him?

39:19.792 --> 39:21.054
I know
it's only been a few weeks,

39:21.097 --> 39:23.970
but I feel like I'm missing
an arm or something.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.232
Well, you could've
brought King.

39:25.275 --> 39:26.320
Yeah, I know,

39:26.364 --> 39:27.713
but Sherry
already claimed him,

39:27.756 --> 39:28.888
and, apparently, he's a big
hit at the fabric store,

39:28.931 --> 39:31.151
and I wanted to give you
my full attention.

39:31.194 --> 39:32.413
Me?

39:32.457 --> 39:34.197
Oh, I'm easy when it
comes to this stuff.

39:34.241 --> 39:36.025
No...

39:36.069 --> 39:37.462
She's the one who's going
to need your full attention.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.516
I feel like I'm in one
of those sleep chambers.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.996
You know, the ones
in Tokyo?

39:50.039 --> 39:51.824
Every time we get
another box of stuff,

39:51.867 --> 39:54.000
I can feel the walls
closing in on me.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.915
I don't think
it's that bad.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.003
No?

39:57.046 --> 39:58.918
You see? No.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.050
Yeah, I actually love
the overall space.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.574
It's, um...
it's intimate.

40:04.097 --> 40:05.141
Really?

40:05.185 --> 40:07.492
Yeah, it's got
that homey feeling,

40:07.535 --> 40:09.232
where, you know,
it makes people feel safe,

40:09.276 --> 40:10.408
comfortable...

40:10.451 --> 40:11.713
but I'm sorry,

40:11.757 --> 40:14.455
the furniture and storage
are terrible.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.413
Hey!

40:15.456 --> 40:16.588
Finally.
Thank you.

40:16.631 --> 40:17.719
It's not that bad.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.025
Like this!

40:19.068 --> 40:19.939
Why do you need
this bulky storage cabinet

40:19.982 --> 40:21.680
for some papers

40:21.723 --> 40:23.290
and this one photo?

40:26.467 --> 40:27.947
Oh, is this that girl...?

40:32.647 --> 40:33.692
Should I just put it back in?

40:33.735 --> 40:35.389
Or you could just
get rid of it?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.956
I just think
that's a bit harsh.

40:36.999 --> 40:38.087
Or appropriate.

40:38.131 --> 40:39.828
It's been two years,
or 14 in dog years.

40:39.872 --> 40:41.439
Why don't I just
slide it back in?

40:42.440 --> 40:43.441
Look...

40:43.484 --> 40:44.659
all I'm saying

40:44.703 --> 40:45.617
is that there's a lot
you could do in here

40:45.660 --> 40:46.922
in a fairly short amount
of time,

40:46.966 --> 40:48.271
and pretty inexpensively, too.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.317
That's great.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.885
So, will you take the job?

40:52.928 --> 40:53.886
No.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.191
: No?

40:55.235 --> 40:58.194
There is not enough work
for you to hire me...

40:58.238 --> 40:59.500
but I'll help you out.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.415
Oh, um...

41:01.459 --> 41:02.895
No, we couldn't do that.
That's just too much work.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.026
Speak for yourself.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.680
I'm a desperate woman.

41:05.724 --> 41:07.203
I will happily
take your help.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.249
Look, it'll make me feel good,
and I love to work,

41:09.292 --> 41:11.425
and how about this?
If you love it so much,

41:11.469 --> 41:12.992
you can give us
a rave review online.

41:13.035 --> 41:14.080
How's that?

41:15.124 --> 41:16.430
Yeah.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.692
Sure.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.564
So, when do you want
to start, roughly?

41:19.607 --> 41:23.002
Well, I'm free now-ish,
if you are?

41:24.133 --> 41:25.134
Perfect.

41:25.178 --> 41:26.179
Great.

41:29.269 --> 41:30.923
Okay,
this was Cindy's favorite,

41:30.966 --> 41:32.402
and I have to agree.

41:32.446 --> 41:34.143
I love vertical storage...
anything with clean lines,

41:34.187 --> 41:36.494
making sure that
everything has its place.

41:36.537 --> 41:37.451
It cuts down
on clutter, and...

41:38.496 --> 41:39.366
What?

41:40.802 --> 41:42.543
Come on.

41:42.587 --> 41:43.413
You don't like structure?

41:43.457 --> 41:44.893
No.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.982
No, no, no, no, this is...
this is totally different.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.070
Is it?

41:48.114 --> 41:49.028
Come on, admit it.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.640
Admit what?

41:52.684 --> 41:54.033
That you and I
have more in common

41:54.076 --> 41:54.773
than you think.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.167
Does that mean
you're sold on the idea?

42:01.519 --> 42:02.520
Yeah.

42:02.563 --> 42:03.521
Great.

42:03.564 --> 42:04.565
Okay,

42:04.609 --> 42:06.567
so let's go
into this now.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.224

Can I get one more "yes"?

43:03.058 --> 43:04.582
Uh...

43:04.625 --> 43:06.192
I don't know
what the question is.

43:06.235 --> 43:07.497

43:07.541 --> 43:09.108
Heh.

43:09.151 --> 43:10.196
I mean,
it's the least I can do

43:10.239 --> 43:11.371
for all of your help.

43:12.981 --> 43:13.939
Yes.

43:22.774 --> 43:24.427
I've been coming
here for a long time.

43:24.471 --> 43:26.386
In fact, ever since
we opened Sit for It.

43:26.429 --> 43:28.301
Mm.

43:28.344 --> 43:31.043
So do you come for the beer,
the pool, or the fireplace?

43:31.086 --> 43:32.479
Would you believe fireplace?

43:32.522 --> 43:33.611
Mm... no.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.438
You're right.

43:35.482 --> 43:36.875
It's the pool,

43:36.918 --> 43:38.093
but my dogs
love the fireplace.

43:38.137 --> 43:39.138
Your dogs come here?

43:39.181 --> 43:41.401
Mm, well,
I mean...

43:41.444 --> 43:43.011
a great place
to train therapy dogs

43:43.055 --> 43:44.665
not to be distracted
by loud noises.

43:45.666 --> 43:46.624
Like that.

43:46.667 --> 43:47.494
Yeah.

43:50.410 --> 43:52.064
Yeah, I guess
you could say this is...

43:53.718 --> 43:54.632
it's kind of my place.

43:59.593 --> 44:01.334
Hey, the table's free.
You want to play?

44:03.423 --> 44:04.511
Are you challenging me?

44:04.554 --> 44:06.382
Well, I mean...

44:06.426 --> 44:07.862
only if you can handle it.

44:07.906 --> 44:10.386
Rock, paper, scissors
for who goes first.

44:10.430 --> 44:11.649
All right.

44:11.692 --> 44:12.737
One. Two. Three.

44:12.780 --> 44:13.999
Oh!

44:15.174 --> 44:16.654
You got me.

44:18.307 --> 44:19.657
I'll rack, you break.

44:21.397 --> 44:22.529
Yeah, cool.

44:31.886 --> 44:33.061
Wow.

44:33.105 --> 44:35.150

Okay, not bad.

45:32.381 --> 45:34.383
Lucky, but not bad.

45:35.776 --> 45:36.690
Oh, really?

45:42.391 --> 45:44.263
I wasn't expecting that.

45:46.047 --> 45:48.267
That's what you get
for challenging an only child.

46:10.855 --> 46:12.117
I hope you like it, King.

46:13.422 --> 46:15.207
I guess everyone needs
their place, right?

46:16.556 --> 46:19.124
Go on.
Go to your new bed.

46:49.937 --> 46:51.809
I'm sorry I didn't
think of this sooner.

46:59.729 --> 47:00.861
: Hello?

47:00.905 --> 47:02.863
Cassie?
Hey, it's Julia.

47:02.907 --> 47:04.691
Look, I know you're looking
at other designers,

47:04.734 --> 47:07.433
but I have one more idea
to run by you.

47:09.174 --> 47:10.566
Thank you for meeting me.

47:10.610 --> 47:12.046
Oh, I have to admit,

47:12.090 --> 47:13.091
your little tease
on the phone

47:13.134 --> 47:15.702
has me quite curious.

47:17.095 --> 47:18.661
Well, I was thinking
about how amazing

47:18.705 --> 47:19.880
this magical forest would be
for your baby,

47:19.924 --> 47:23.188
but realized I had
forgotten one thing...

47:24.319 --> 47:25.407
a magical place
for Ginger.

47:25.451 --> 47:26.582
For Ginger?

47:26.626 --> 47:28.628
And her puppies,
of course.

47:29.759 --> 47:31.109
A nursery.

47:33.241 --> 47:36.375
Actually,
it would be a puppery.

47:36.418 --> 47:37.593
A puppery?

47:37.637 --> 47:38.986
A puppy room.

47:39.030 --> 47:40.161
You said you wanted
a special treat for Ginger,

47:40.205 --> 47:42.685
so this would be
their special place.

47:46.907 --> 47:48.430
I don't know
if it's the pregnancy hormones,

47:48.474 --> 47:49.997
but... I just love that.

47:50.041 --> 47:51.738
You do?

47:51.781 --> 47:54.001
I do.
It's very unique.

47:54.045 --> 47:56.482
Only thing...
Ginger is due in two weeks.

47:56.525 --> 47:57.831
Can you get both done
in that time?

47:57.875 --> 47:59.398
Absolutely.

47:59.441 --> 48:00.486
Really?

48:00.529 --> 48:02.357
That mean
we got the job?

48:16.502 --> 48:18.330
That's okay.
It was a long shot.

48:19.505 --> 48:20.506
I'm really glad

48:20.549 --> 48:22.116
that you went
in there swinging.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.075
It was brutal.

48:24.118 --> 48:25.380
Really?

48:26.860 --> 48:27.774
No.

48:29.994 --> 48:30.951
Eye of the tiger, baby!

48:30.995 --> 48:32.257
We got the job?

48:32.300 --> 48:33.171
We got the job!

48:33.214 --> 48:34.433
Oh!

48:34.476 --> 48:36.826
We got the job!

48:36.870 --> 48:37.740
Hey!

48:37.784 --> 48:39.438
Hey, we got the job!

48:41.614 --> 48:42.571
We got the job.

48:43.572 --> 48:44.573
What?

48:44.617 --> 48:45.792
We got the job.

48:55.280 --> 48:56.759
Breathe deeply.

49:00.285 --> 49:01.721
Quiet your mind.

49:03.288 --> 49:05.507
Nope.
Still not helping, buddy.

49:05.551 --> 49:08.249
My focus comes
from being centered.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.297
Breathing keeps me centered.

49:16.388 --> 49:17.824
I don't know
what I like more,

49:17.867 --> 49:19.521
the fact that there are
pen holders in here,

49:19.565 --> 49:21.480
or actual empty drawers.

49:21.523 --> 49:23.656
You do realize you need
to get out more, right?

49:23.699 --> 49:26.137
Said by the man
who refuses to date.

49:26.180 --> 49:28.966
I don't refuse.
I just chose to focus on...

49:31.925 --> 49:33.318
You said it, not me.

49:33.361 --> 49:34.319
Hi.

49:34.362 --> 49:35.885
Hey.

49:35.929 --> 49:38.062
Sorry, I know our next session
isn't until next Saturday,

49:38.105 --> 49:39.889
but I got the job,
the Cassie job,

49:39.933 --> 49:41.065
and it's kind of
because of you.

49:41.108 --> 49:42.718
Me?

49:42.762 --> 49:43.981
You talked about your place,
which made me think about King,

49:44.024 --> 49:44.807
so I gave him a place,
and the next you know,

49:44.851 --> 49:46.287
I'm designing a puppery!

49:47.332 --> 49:48.376
Sorry, a what?

49:48.420 --> 49:49.638
And it's not
just about Cassie.

49:49.682 --> 49:51.771
It's about all the people
who come with her.

49:51.814 --> 49:53.164
I'm sorry, a puppery?

49:53.207 --> 49:55.166
Do you know what that is?

49:55.209 --> 49:56.950
No, because I made it up!

49:56.994 --> 49:58.778
Okay, you're spinning out here.

49:58.821 --> 50:00.171
The nursery, I can do.

50:00.214 --> 50:01.955
The puppery, I have no idea,

50:01.999 --> 50:03.826
so that's why I'm here.

50:03.870 --> 50:07.047
So you want me
to help you with...

50:07.091 --> 50:08.440
a puppery?

50:08.483 --> 50:10.529
Just kind of, like,
spitball ideas, that's all.

50:12.096 --> 50:13.184
Um...

50:13.227 --> 50:14.620
Okay, I'm really, really,
really open

50:14.663 --> 50:15.925
because as you know,

50:15.969 --> 50:16.796
dogs aren't really
my strong suit.

50:16.839 --> 50:17.753
I mean, they are...

50:17.797 --> 50:19.103
you are, King...

50:19.146 --> 50:20.713
but just dogs in general,

50:20.756 --> 50:21.844
I don't have
that much experience with them.

50:21.888 --> 50:23.150
Let's go.

50:23.194 --> 50:24.456
What?

50:24.499 --> 50:25.718
You said the first thing
that came to my mind.

50:25.761 --> 50:26.719
Let's go.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.113
Okay...

50:29.156 --> 50:30.766
Come on!

50:30.810 --> 50:31.724
Bye!

50:31.767 --> 50:32.725
Bye.

50:47.566 --> 50:48.523
I don't understand
what this has to do

50:48.567 --> 50:49.481
with the puppery.

50:51.439 --> 50:53.050
I just... I want you
to go for it.

50:53.093 --> 50:54.486
Wait, I'm sorry,

50:54.529 --> 50:55.878
are we having a session
right now?

50:55.922 --> 50:57.837
Do you trust me?

50:59.360 --> 51:02.537
Okay, so you just...
want him to run?

51:02.581 --> 51:04.148
Seems a little anti-you.

51:04.191 --> 51:06.715
Well, that's why you're both
going to do it together.

51:06.759 --> 51:08.108
Are you serious?

51:08.152 --> 51:09.501
You're the one that wanted
to get down and dirty.

51:09.544 --> 51:10.719
- No!
- Go!

51:10.763 --> 51:12.199
King!

51:17.117 --> 51:18.118
Oh, look at that!

51:18.162 --> 51:20.468
Oh, you're such a good boy.

51:20.512 --> 51:22.731
Come on, come on!
Let's go!

51:26.431 --> 51:29.738
Oh, my gosh, I did not know
he could run like that.

51:29.782 --> 51:31.131
How do you feel?

51:31.175 --> 51:32.611
Besides out of shape?

51:33.786 --> 51:35.962
Good, good.

51:36.005 --> 51:38.095
I don't know how that helped
my training skills, though.

51:38.138 --> 51:40.097
It didn't.

51:40.140 --> 51:41.359
I'm sorry, what?

51:41.402 --> 51:43.578
It's not always
about learning.

51:43.622 --> 51:45.537
It's about feeling.
It's about your bond.

51:45.580 --> 51:47.582
That sounds
like something I would say.

51:47.626 --> 51:48.627
Well...

51:50.411 --> 51:51.369
you're not the only one
learning here...

51:53.066 --> 51:55.634
and besides, I thought it...

51:55.677 --> 51:56.939
looked like you two
could use a release.

52:02.597 --> 52:03.990
It's amazing how happy you are
when they're happy.

52:04.033 --> 52:05.426
That's why
I feel so lucky.

52:05.470 --> 52:07.385
I get to work on this every day.

52:08.734 --> 52:10.214
Did you always know
you wanted to be a trainer?

52:10.257 --> 52:12.825
I always knew
that I wanted to fix things,

52:12.868 --> 52:15.132
even when I was little.

52:15.175 --> 52:18.918
So I started training
therapy dogs, rescue dogs...

52:18.961 --> 52:21.312
and when I saw how they changed
people's lives...

52:23.966 --> 52:26.230
I couldn't picture myself
doing anything else.

52:26.273 --> 52:27.796
You know, you're pretty good

52:27.840 --> 52:31.844
at this whole dog training,
reading people thing.

52:31.887 --> 52:33.193
You could open
a dozen Sits for Its,

52:33.237 --> 52:34.107
and they'd all be busy.

52:34.151 --> 52:35.674
Huh.

52:37.197 --> 52:38.155
Sorry, did I say
something wrong?

52:39.373 --> 52:40.418
No.

52:40.461 --> 52:41.767
No?

52:43.943 --> 52:46.728
It was just something
my ex used to say.

52:46.772 --> 52:49.078
Oh, right.

52:49.122 --> 52:50.210
The poodle lady?

52:50.254 --> 52:52.081
Was it that obvious?

52:52.125 --> 52:53.431
Not on the street, no,

52:53.474 --> 52:55.215
but Cindy kind of helped
drive it home

52:55.259 --> 52:56.651
with the whole photo thing.

52:56.695 --> 52:58.697
Right. Well...

52:58.740 --> 53:01.134
it's not that exciting.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.397
She thought that I should
expand the business.

53:03.441 --> 53:05.356
She had a rich uncle
that was willing to invest...

53:07.619 --> 53:09.011
and I liked it the way it was.

53:10.665 --> 53:12.624
Apparently, that was
my "lack of ambition."

53:12.667 --> 53:15.104
Or pride in what you do.

53:15.148 --> 53:16.236
So, did you break up with her?

53:16.280 --> 53:18.020
No, she dumped me.

53:20.066 --> 53:21.241
It was pretty brutal, actually.

53:21.285 --> 53:23.243
I'm sorry.

53:23.287 --> 53:25.158
Guess you can't fix
everything, right?

53:27.987 --> 53:28.857
That's a good boy.

53:30.207 --> 53:31.251
Well?

53:31.295 --> 53:32.426
How do you feel?

53:32.470 --> 53:34.385
I feel as ready
as I'll ever be.

53:35.777 --> 53:36.561
That's a good place to start.

53:38.780 --> 53:41.392
Hey, um...

53:41.435 --> 53:43.220
I could come check out
that space...

53:43.263 --> 53:44.873
if-- if you want.

53:47.136 --> 53:48.921
It's kind of my turn
to help you out now.

53:51.793 --> 53:52.664
- Oh, hey--
- Oh--

53:58.060 --> 53:59.192
So yeah,

53:59.236 --> 54:01.890
uh, if you want
to come look at the place,

54:01.934 --> 54:03.892
um...

54:03.936 --> 54:06.895
we have time,
but that would be nice.

54:06.939 --> 54:08.114
Okay.

54:08.157 --> 54:09.202
And Owen?

54:09.246 --> 54:10.899
Just for the record,
I, um...

54:10.943 --> 54:13.424
I don't think there'd be space

54:13.467 --> 54:16.078
for the poodle lady
on the wall anyway.

54:16.122 --> 54:16.949
You're probably right.

54:26.393 --> 54:28.134
Okay, I think
we should go with mahogany.

54:28.177 --> 54:30.702
It's rich and soothing.

54:30.745 --> 54:31.877
We can oil it
and get a darker hue,

54:31.920 --> 54:32.965
if you want?

54:33.008 --> 54:34.793
That sounds perfect.

54:34.836 --> 54:36.098
Let me just ask Owen

54:36.142 --> 54:36.882
about the materials
for the puppery.

54:38.100 --> 54:39.145
That's a nice excuse.

54:39.188 --> 54:40.886
What? No!

54:40.929 --> 54:42.017
No, no, no.

54:42.061 --> 54:43.454
I'm not...
we're not...

54:44.629 --> 54:45.760
I don't even know

54:45.804 --> 54:47.414
if he's over
his ex-girlfriend or not,

54:47.458 --> 54:50.635
and besides, even if he was,
I don't need the distraction.

54:50.678 --> 54:51.723
Right?

54:53.246 --> 54:55.466
Just...
grab the samples, please.

55:03.952 --> 55:05.389
Hello?

55:05.432 --> 55:06.303
Hi, Cassie.

55:07.695 --> 55:08.914
Yes, is everything okay?

55:11.395 --> 55:13.658
Thank you.

55:13.701 --> 55:14.659
Hey, Cassie.

55:14.702 --> 55:16.661
Hi!

55:16.704 --> 55:18.315
Uh, on the phone,
you said you needed my help?

55:18.358 --> 55:20.360
Yes, I've decided
to throw a shower.

55:20.404 --> 55:22.057
Okay...

55:22.101 --> 55:23.755
and you want me to help you
plan your baby shower?

55:23.798 --> 55:25.409
It's a puppy shower...

55:25.452 --> 55:26.888
actually, more of
a fund-raiser

55:26.932 --> 55:29.238
for the American Humane
Association...

55:29.282 --> 55:31.066
but that way, we can totally
show off your work

55:31.110 --> 55:32.981
and raise money
for a good cause.

55:33.025 --> 55:34.418
Great!

55:34.461 --> 55:35.810
Yeah, and you don't have to do
anything to plan it,

55:35.854 --> 55:38.378
but I do need you
to have everything done...

55:38.422 --> 55:39.336
by this Saturday.

55:41.773 --> 55:44.297
Okay, so...

55:44.341 --> 55:45.951
that's less than a week away.

55:45.994 --> 55:48.823
I realize
it's a tad accelerated,

55:48.867 --> 55:49.955
but I really want
to have this done

55:49.998 --> 55:51.260
before Ginger
has her puppies,

55:51.304 --> 55:52.653
and I totally
believe in you.

55:52.697 --> 55:53.654
I can handle it.

55:53.698 --> 55:55.395
You are amazing.

55:55.439 --> 55:56.309
It's going to be great.

55:56.353 --> 55:57.702
Okay, honey!

55:57.745 --> 55:59.268
We've got some planning to do.
Let's go. Okay.

55:59.312 --> 56:01.401
Let's go.
Here we go.

56:01.445 --> 56:02.707
Let's go.
Here we go.

56:06.014 --> 56:07.015
It's Owen.

56:07.059 --> 56:08.234
Hey...

56:08.277 --> 56:09.540
I might need you
sooner than I thought.

56:17.765 --> 56:19.550
: Okay,
so it's right around here.

56:23.945 --> 56:26.252
Okay, so this is literally

56:26.295 --> 56:28.385
where the magic
is going to happen.

56:28.428 --> 56:30.125
Hope you're talking
about my amazing skills?

56:30.169 --> 56:31.649
Owen,
you remember Sherry, right?

56:31.692 --> 56:33.346
My magical designer.

56:33.390 --> 56:34.869
She has to say that.

56:34.913 --> 56:35.914
She's working me
to the bone.

56:37.219 --> 56:39.874
Well, it's already
looking great in there.

56:39.918 --> 56:41.006
Thanks.

56:41.049 --> 56:42.137
Oh, so this is it
over here?

56:42.181 --> 56:43.182
Yes.

56:43.225 --> 56:45.053
Hey, Julia?

56:45.097 --> 56:46.577
Yeah?

56:46.620 --> 56:49.101
I'm really glad he's not,
you know, good-looking at all.

56:49.144 --> 56:49.928
Yeah, I told you.

56:51.059 --> 56:51.886
Keep your focus, lady!

56:51.930 --> 56:53.671
Laser!

56:58.719 --> 57:01.200
So I was planning
on dividing the room

57:01.243 --> 57:03.376
into a feeding, sleeping,
and play area.

57:03.420 --> 57:04.508
Mm.

57:04.551 --> 57:06.248
Yeah, no, I like it.

57:06.292 --> 57:07.728
You're just going
to want to make sure

57:07.772 --> 57:08.860
you give Ginger a place
to interact with her puppies

57:08.903 --> 57:09.730
and rest on her own.

57:09.774 --> 57:10.949
Okay.

57:10.992 --> 57:12.429
I also wanted a doggy
door to the deck,

57:12.472 --> 57:14.082
but Cassie's hesitant
to cut into the wall

57:14.126 --> 57:16.911
because she doesn't
want a draft.

57:16.955 --> 57:19.131
Well, you know, they make
electronic doors now.

57:19.174 --> 57:20.611
The dogs wear a chip
on their collar

57:20.654 --> 57:22.308
and the door opens and closes
automatically

57:22.351 --> 57:24.049
as they approach.

57:24.092 --> 57:25.877
I would imagine
that would cut the draft.

57:25.920 --> 57:28.445
And that is why they pay you
the big bucks.

57:29.707 --> 57:31.448
Sorry, nervous tick.

57:34.233 --> 57:36.104
If you work as quickly in here
as you did in there,

57:36.148 --> 57:37.497
you'll be done
ahead of schedule.

57:37.541 --> 57:38.933
I'm not so sure
about that.

57:38.977 --> 57:40.065
Cassie, this is Owen.

57:40.108 --> 57:42.110
Oh, are you part
of Julia's design team?

57:42.154 --> 57:43.416
No, not really.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.287
I train Julia's dog.

57:45.331 --> 57:48.116
Owen understands dogs
better than anyone,

57:48.160 --> 57:49.770
so I wanted to
consult with him

57:49.814 --> 57:51.598
to make sure we didn't
miss anything.

57:51.642 --> 57:52.773
I love it.

57:52.817 --> 57:54.427
So do you know
about our little fundraiser

57:54.471 --> 57:56.081
for the American
Humane Association

57:56.124 --> 57:57.561
Shelter to Service Program?

57:57.604 --> 57:59.301
I've worked with them before.
It's a great program.

57:59.345 --> 58:00.259
What do they do?

58:01.869 --> 58:03.088
It's an extensive process,

58:03.131 --> 58:04.306
but it's all about training
shelter dogs

58:04.350 --> 58:06.308
to work
with veterans in need.

58:07.832 --> 58:09.573
It's some of the most
rewarding work I've ever done.

58:09.616 --> 58:11.139
Well, I hope you can join us,

58:11.183 --> 58:13.446
and don't be scared
of the whole "shower" thing.

58:13.490 --> 58:14.534
There'll be
lots of other guys there

58:14.578 --> 58:15.535
and plenty of food.

58:15.579 --> 58:17.102
Are you all set?

58:18.233 --> 58:19.321
Yeah.

58:19.365 --> 58:20.845
I'm great, thank you.

58:20.888 --> 58:21.933
Okay, I'll leave
you to it.

58:21.976 --> 58:22.977
Okay.

58:25.589 --> 58:27.025
Wow.

58:27.068 --> 58:27.939
You sound very relaxed.

58:27.982 --> 58:29.767
I feel very relaxed.

58:32.900 --> 58:34.032
Let's get to work!
Come on!

58:34.075 --> 58:36.774
I want this room
cleared, right now.

58:36.817 --> 58:37.557
So grab
that chair.

58:37.601 --> 58:39.124
All right.

58:39.167 --> 58:40.081
Geez.

58:41.213 --> 58:42.170
I thought I was
a task master.

58:45.347 --> 58:46.827
What?

58:46.871 --> 58:48.220
Come on.

58:48.263 --> 58:49.395
Can you grab
this chair?

59:04.192 --> 59:06.891
Okay, one, two, three.

59:08.196 --> 59:09.676
Perfect.

59:10.982 --> 59:11.896
Okay, King.

59:13.811 --> 59:14.855
Sit.

59:18.555 --> 59:19.556
Shake.

59:21.558 --> 59:22.559
Stay.

59:23.864 --> 59:24.865
Stay.

59:26.693 --> 59:27.738
Stay.

59:28.695 --> 59:29.566
Stay.

59:32.133 --> 59:33.961
Okay!

59:34.005 --> 59:36.921
Good boy!

59:36.964 --> 59:38.226
Ready? Come on!

01:00:06.124 --> 01:00:07.342
Ta-dah!

01:00:07.386 --> 01:00:08.605
Wow!

01:00:08.648 --> 01:00:11.956
That... is fantastic.

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:13.131
Thank you.

01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:24.577
To the best team
and first project

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.839
a girl could ask for.

01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:26.927
Thank you.

01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:27.885
I will cheers to that.

01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:28.973
Ditto.

01:00:32.237 --> 01:00:34.543
I cannot believe
that the shower is tomorrow.

01:00:34.587 --> 01:00:36.589
I can't believe all the people
that are going to be there.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:37.938
That list is crazy.

01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:39.592
And really fancy.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.115
Yeah,

01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:42.987
which is why I'm not going
to be able to sleep tonight,

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:44.118
or eat.

01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:45.729
You should be very proud.

01:00:45.772 --> 01:00:47.252
They're going to be impressed,
I promise.

01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:48.993
Well, luckily, you'll be there
to tell them that.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.213
All right, do you guys
want to order?

01:00:52.257 --> 01:00:54.215
It's on me,
so please load up.

01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:56.391
Actually, I can't stay.
It's Friday night.

01:00:56.435 --> 01:00:58.742
Oh, right.

01:00:58.785 --> 01:00:59.743
I forgot.

01:00:59.786 --> 01:01:01.005
What's Friday night?

01:01:01.048 --> 01:01:02.615
Owen's standing date
with his best friends.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.704
If it wasn't
such a tradition...

01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:05.966
No, totally.

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.576
We'll just, uh,
we'll celebrate tomorrow.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.969
Don't even think
about it.

01:01:09.013 --> 01:01:09.970
Really?

01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:11.319
Yes, totally.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:13.626
Okay.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.193
Bye.

01:01:23.984 --> 01:01:25.029
Great!

01:01:25.072 --> 01:01:26.944
If you're paying,

01:01:26.987 --> 01:01:28.597
I'm going to order
a ton of food.

01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:30.034
You would.

01:01:46.877 --> 01:01:48.443
I was just in the area.

01:01:48.487 --> 01:01:50.663
You were just in the area
with flowers?

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:53.405
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:55.102
I generally make a habit
of carrying them around with me.

01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:56.408
Smart.

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:01.152
I'm sorry I had
to take off earlier,

01:02:01.195 --> 01:02:02.762
but I'd like
to finish celebrating with you,

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:04.242
if... you're free?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.333
Free, like... now free?

01:02:08.376 --> 01:02:10.335
If you can fit it
into your schedule.

01:02:27.221 --> 01:02:29.093
Stop it!
Are you serious?

01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:31.617
: I, uh...

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:36.448
I thought you could use
a relaxing glass of wine

01:02:36.491 --> 01:02:37.754
in the most beautiful
spot in the city.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.758
This is gorgeous.

01:02:41.801 --> 01:02:44.891
You were clearly
raised a gentleman.

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:47.546
Well, my parents
were married 35 years.

01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:48.808
Aw, were they
high school sweethearts?

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:51.289
Yes, they were.

01:02:51.332 --> 01:02:52.638
What about yours?

01:02:52.681 --> 01:02:54.074
Oh, no.

01:02:54.118 --> 01:02:55.554
No, mine, uh...

01:02:55.597 --> 01:02:56.729
mine have been divorced
since I was in high school.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.513
Oh... sorry.

01:02:58.557 --> 01:02:59.776
No, don't be.

01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.647
They're actually
really good friends.

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:05.042
They just couldn't juggle
career and marriage together.

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.870
Is that why you put
everything you have

01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:07.871
into your business?

01:03:09.698 --> 01:03:10.830
No.

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.527
No, I, uh...

01:03:12.571 --> 01:03:14.051
I tried both once.

01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:17.010
It just...
didn't work out.

01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:20.144
Well, that doesn't mean
that it can't.

01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:28.805
I can't believe
you did all this.

01:03:28.848 --> 01:03:30.328
Well, thought
you might need a reminder

01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:31.895
of all ways you've made
this city beautiful.

01:03:31.938 --> 01:03:33.461
What?

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:35.507
Well, here's...

01:03:36.725 --> 01:03:38.466
Astoria Tower
right there...

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.382
and the Margowsky Library,

01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:43.863
and you can see
the rooftop garden

01:03:43.907 --> 01:03:45.647
on the Parker Tower,

01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:47.519
and the Harris Building.

01:03:47.562 --> 01:03:49.347
All the buildings
I worked on at Baluster Bay.

01:03:52.437 --> 01:03:54.308
People are going
to love what you do

01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:55.832
as long
as you believe in it.

01:04:00.227 --> 01:04:02.186
You're too much,
you know that?

01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:05.798
Like, in a good way?

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.844
Um... yeah.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.892
I can't believe
how late it is.

01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:18.245
Thank you for...
everything.

01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:19.812
It's a big day tomorrow.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.292
Yeah.

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:23.033
King's graduation
and a puppy shower.

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:27.907
There's lots
to be excited about.

01:04:27.951 --> 01:04:29.343
Yeah, there definitely is.

01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:47.144
Is he going to get
his nose stuck in the door?

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:48.188
No, he...

01:04:49.929 --> 01:04:50.887
No, probably not.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.368
I should, um...

01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:56.588
I should probably go.

01:04:57.632 --> 01:04:58.677
Okay.

01:05:09.296 --> 01:05:10.297
Bye.

01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.908
Bye.

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:32.798
Breathing keeps me centered.

01:05:34.669 --> 01:05:38.369
Light and happy
is my natural state.

01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:42.286
My light shines from within.

01:05:47.987 --> 01:05:48.945
"Would you like to permanently
delete the meditation app

01:05:48.988 --> 01:05:49.989
from your phone,

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:51.469
and all of its data?"

01:05:52.513 --> 01:05:53.950
Absolutely.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.172
Come on!

01:06:01.827 --> 01:06:03.220
: Well, he stopped
sitting on my feet,

01:06:03.263 --> 01:06:04.438
so that was a good thing,

01:06:04.482 --> 01:06:05.570
and then I decided
no more fancy collars.

01:06:06.875 --> 01:06:08.268
I can't imagine
he was a fan.

01:06:08.312 --> 01:06:10.444
He was not, no...

01:06:10.488 --> 01:06:12.577
but other than that,
things are going really well.

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:14.144
I clearly had some help, though.

01:06:19.192 --> 01:06:20.454
See?

01:06:20.498 --> 01:06:21.673
I told you he was great.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.023
He kind of is.

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:26.199
Hey, I know you're super busy,

01:06:26.243 --> 01:06:27.809
but any chance you want
to come share your story

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:30.334
at the adoption fair tomorrow?

01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:31.639
My story?
Really?

01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:33.424
Yeah.

01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:34.903
Even the bit
where I couldn't get him to sit,

01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:36.818
or sleep,
or even take a treat?

01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:39.038
Especially those bits.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:39.996
Those are the things
that show people

01:06:40.039 --> 01:06:41.084
how to be a loving dog owner,

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:43.390
and you are definitely that.

01:06:43.434 --> 01:06:45.349
Well then,
I would be honored.

01:06:52.921 --> 01:06:55.141
: You know, most
of our graduation ceremonies

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:56.751
don't have quite as much
pomp and circumstance

01:06:56.795 --> 01:06:58.057
as this one.

01:06:58.101 --> 01:06:59.102
Yeah, that's what happens

01:06:59.145 --> 01:07:00.190
when you organize
someone's office.

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:03.541
I don't think
that's the reason.

01:07:14.247 --> 01:07:15.161
He didn't!

01:07:25.128 --> 01:07:25.998
Okay. King?

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.130
Sit.

01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:30.394
Stay.

01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:33.788
I'm here

01:07:33.832 --> 01:07:36.052
to present to you
this plaque.

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:37.836
- It's a real beauty.
- Yeah.

01:07:37.879 --> 01:07:39.272
Just in case
you were wondering,

01:07:39.316 --> 01:07:41.013
these are highly coveted
in the art world.

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:42.188
That's good to know.

01:07:42.232 --> 01:07:44.234
You both have shown
huge progress

01:07:44.277 --> 01:07:45.191
in the last four weeks,

01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:46.540
so it's with pride...

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.675
and, I'll admit it,
a little sadness...

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:55.636
that I declare King...

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.464
and Julia Galvins...

01:07:57.508 --> 01:07:58.378
our newest graduates.

01:07:59.945 --> 01:08:00.859
Congratulations.

01:08:00.902 --> 01:08:01.903
Yay!

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.429
Look, King!
Congratulations!

01:08:05.472 --> 01:08:06.386
You're such a good boy.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:09.128
He did good.

01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:10.086
You too.

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:11.217
I tried.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:13.959
So I'll see you tonight?

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.527
Actually, I don't know.

01:08:16.569 --> 01:08:18.094
Oh, you don't know?

01:08:20.921 --> 01:08:21.880
I haven't really found
a date yet.

01:08:26.406 --> 01:08:27.277
Can I pick you up at 8:00?

01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:31.629
Yeah.

01:08:39.506 --> 01:08:41.465
This is too dressy for
a puppy shower, isn't it?

01:08:41.508 --> 01:08:43.466
But then again,
it is a fundraiser,

01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:44.903
and a date, so...

01:08:44.946 --> 01:08:45.947
I don't know.
What do you think?

01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:48.819
Well, thanks, sir.

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:50.908
I think you're right.

01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:53.259
It's perfect.

01:08:54.346 --> 01:08:55.479
I'm coming,
I'm coming.

01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:56.435
I'm coming!

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:04.227
Hi.

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:06.446
Hi.

01:09:06.490 --> 01:09:08.361
I, uh...

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:09.754
wasn't sure what
the dress code was

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:11.756
for a puppy shower...

01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:14.106
although it's not just
a puppy shower...

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.629
I was right there with you.

01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:18.893
You look incredible.

01:09:18.937 --> 01:09:20.720
Thank you.

01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:21.853
So do you.

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:23.246
Thanks.

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:38.912
I can't believe
the puppies came early,

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:40.350
and we're just finding out.

01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:41.568
They're so adorable.

01:09:41.612 --> 01:09:42.613
Yeah, at least we know

01:09:42.656 --> 01:09:43.962
everything's working
in there.

01:09:44.005 --> 01:09:45.180
Yeah, fingers crossed.

01:09:47.139 --> 01:09:49.620
Oh, wow,
everyone's so fancy.

01:09:49.662 --> 01:09:50.969
Yeah.

01:09:51.011 --> 01:09:52.926
Do you know anyone here?

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.234
Uh, a few,
yeah, actually.

01:09:55.278 --> 01:09:56.192
Quite a few.

01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:59.543
I don't know about you guys,

01:09:59.586 --> 01:10:01.240
but I had no idea what to wear
to this kind of thing.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:03.764
I think you nailed it.
You look beautiful.

01:10:03.808 --> 01:10:06.114
Good...
'cause I can't breathe.

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:09.727
Did you guys see those puppies?
It looks like we staged them.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.381
I'm going to go up there
for a little cuddle

01:10:11.424 --> 01:10:12.860
before I go and hunt down
some new clients.

01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:13.861
Have fun.

01:10:15.559 --> 01:10:16.516
Well...

01:10:18.257 --> 01:10:19.737
Oh!

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:20.651
Did he just see me?

01:10:22.043 --> 01:10:23.219
Who are you
talking about?

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:25.046
Wyatt Salas. Marine shirt.
Judgmental brow.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:26.526
My first rejection
going solo,

01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:28.311
so it still kind of...

01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:29.225
still kind of stings
a little bit.

01:10:30.661 --> 01:10:33.272
Well, you should get out
and say hi.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:34.926
Julia, this is your event.

01:10:36.623 --> 01:10:37.494
You're right.

01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:39.496
Yeah.

01:10:39.539 --> 01:10:40.671
Hi!

01:10:40.714 --> 01:10:41.541
It's more of a welcome party,
isn't it?

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.370
Everything is
phenomenal.

01:10:44.414 --> 01:10:46.285
Thank you,
and congratulations.

01:10:46.329 --> 01:10:47.286
Thank you.

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:48.592
Have you tried
the Puppy Punch?

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.116
No, no, not yet.

01:10:51.159 --> 01:10:52.465
Well, you should,

01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:54.250
and also,
please play some games.

01:10:54.293 --> 01:10:55.425
I know
they're totally ridiculous,

01:10:55.468 --> 01:10:57.340
but what I've found is,
over the years,

01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:59.820
people tend to donate more
when they're having fun,

01:10:59.864 --> 01:11:00.821
so go have some fun.

01:11:00.865 --> 01:11:01.735
Okay.

01:11:01.779 --> 01:11:02.693
Okay.

01:11:04.477 --> 01:11:05.348
: Pin the Tail
on the Spaniel?

01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:06.436
Seriously?

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:08.481
She said to have fun,
so come on.

01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:09.917
Okay.
Sure, whatever you say.

01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:11.136
Okay.

01:11:11.179 --> 01:11:11.963
All right.

01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:16.141
Make sure you
cannot see anything.

01:11:17.969 --> 01:11:18.883
It's pitch black.

01:11:18.926 --> 01:11:19.927
Okay.

01:11:19.971 --> 01:11:21.668
Ready?

01:11:21.712 --> 01:11:23.757
One... two...

01:11:23.801 --> 01:11:24.715
Okay, grab this.

01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:26.107
Okay.

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:27.631
All right, go.

01:11:27.674 --> 01:11:29.720
Okay, wait.
Let me help you out.

01:11:37.075 --> 01:11:38.119
Oh!

01:11:38.163 --> 01:11:40.034
So close!

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:41.819
Painfully so, yeah.

01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:43.864
What, you think
you can do better?

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:45.039
Yeah.

01:11:45.083 --> 01:11:47.433
Oh, well,
let's just get a tail and see...

01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:49.479
Bridget?

01:11:50.436 --> 01:11:51.350
Wow.

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.396
Wha...
what are you doing here?

01:11:53.439 --> 01:11:54.571
I came with my uncle.

01:11:55.572 --> 01:11:58.096
Oh, yeah, of course. Hi.

01:11:58.139 --> 01:11:59.489
So, what are you doing here?

01:11:59.532 --> 01:12:02.492
Just playing...

01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:04.320
Pin the Tail
on the... Spaniel...

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:09.281
and I helped Julia
with the puppery.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.978
You must be
Julia Galvins then?

01:12:11.022 --> 01:12:14.155
Yes, that is...
that is me.

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:15.592
'Scuse me.

01:12:15.635 --> 01:12:17.071
As soon as they asked
about the soundproofing,

01:12:17.115 --> 01:12:18.203
I just froze.

01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:19.509
I'm doing
a horrendous job.

01:12:19.552 --> 01:12:20.292
You're going to have
to explain the concept.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:21.206
Come!

01:12:22.555 --> 01:12:23.687
Sorry.

01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:32.348
So, uh...

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.487
: Okay, so you've met
Vince from the opera house,

01:12:41.531 --> 01:12:43.446
and Marlene
from the wine board...

01:12:43.489 --> 01:12:45.535
Ah! What about
Wyatt Salas?

01:12:45.578 --> 01:12:46.536
Oh, no, that's okay.

01:12:46.579 --> 01:12:47.493
No, no. Come here.

01:12:47.537 --> 01:12:48.842
Wyatt?

01:12:48.886 --> 01:12:50.583
I would love you to meet
my brilliant designer,

01:12:50.627 --> 01:12:52.368
Julia Galvins.

01:12:52.411 --> 01:12:53.760
Julia, this is Wyatt.

01:12:53.804 --> 01:12:54.892
We've met.

01:12:54.935 --> 01:12:56.720
Hi there.

01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:58.504
I have to say,

01:12:58.548 --> 01:13:00.027
I travel

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:02.943
with my two very spoiled
Jack Russell Terriers

01:13:02.987 --> 01:13:04.467
everywhere,

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:06.425
and I've never heard
of a puppery before.

01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:09.646
So why doesn't Julia give you
a little tour of the puppery?

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:12.344
Yes. Sure.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.563
Awesome.

01:13:13.606 --> 01:13:14.520
Right this way.

01:13:14.564 --> 01:13:15.652
Great.

01:13:21.701 --> 01:13:23.268
And this is the puppery.

01:13:23.311 --> 01:13:24.530
Wow!

01:13:27.446 --> 01:13:29.361
I love
the beauty of the panels,

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.842
but it also provides
a soundproof barrier

01:13:31.885 --> 01:13:33.626
between the puppery
and the nursery,

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:34.932
so the puppies
won't disrupt the baby,

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:36.803
and vice versa.

01:13:36.847 --> 01:13:38.631
So you thought
of everything?

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:39.980
We tried to think
of everything,

01:13:40.024 --> 01:13:42.287
which is good,
since...

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:45.072
they made
an early appearance.

01:13:47.597 --> 01:13:48.946
Now you get
to see it in action.

01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.557
I'm impressed.

01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:53.124
Thank you.

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:58.477
I think it's
perfect for you.

01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:00.610
I'm glad you didn't
listen to me.

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:03.090
I'm sorry.

01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:05.963
Everything happens
for a reason.

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:08.618
I'm glad
you found your reason.

01:14:10.315 --> 01:14:12.056
Julia...

01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:15.451
I think
I underestimated you.

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:16.756
What?

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.366
What you've done
with these rooms...

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:19.498
it's, uh,
it's incredible.

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:20.586
It turns out

01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:23.197
I'm pulling up
the next project,

01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:25.025
and I'm going to need
another designer.

01:14:25.069 --> 01:14:26.244
What do you think?

01:14:26.287 --> 01:14:28.551
I... yeah, I think
that sounds... great!

01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:30.466
I'm sure we can talk
more about it tomorrow,

01:14:30.509 --> 01:14:31.858
but I think...

01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:33.294
I think right now,
I just need some Puppy Punch,

01:14:33.338 --> 01:14:34.644
so... excuse me.

01:14:36.689 --> 01:14:37.777
Okay.

01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:44.001
Hey!

01:14:45.002 --> 01:14:46.525
How'd it go?

01:14:46.569 --> 01:14:47.700
I'm sorry?

01:14:47.744 --> 01:14:49.267
I saw you
talking to "judgmental brow."

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:50.311
How'd it go?

01:14:50.355 --> 01:14:52.096
I don't know.

01:14:52.139 --> 01:14:53.576
What do you mean,
you don't know?

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:55.447
I don't know
right now, okay?

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.493
Hey, clearly,
you're not okay.

01:14:57.536 --> 01:14:58.450
Wha...

01:14:59.799 --> 01:15:00.800
Does this have something
to do with Bridget?

01:15:00.844 --> 01:15:02.498
The poodle owner?

01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:05.936
Yeah... she's my ex,

01:15:05.979 --> 01:15:09.026
but why are you so upset
with me?

01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:11.942
You think
you're the only one

01:15:11.985 --> 01:15:12.943
who can read people?

01:15:12.986 --> 01:15:14.292
What are you talking about?

01:15:14.335 --> 01:15:15.946
You know what?
It's okay.

01:15:15.989 --> 01:15:17.556
I just,
I should've realized it sooner.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.298
I mean, I kind of suspected it
with you avoiding her.

01:15:20.341 --> 01:15:22.605
Oh, and then there was
the whole photo thing,

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:23.867
but... you're not over her.

01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:25.085
I get it.
It's okay.

01:15:25.129 --> 01:15:26.783
No, there's...
there's nothing to get.

01:15:28.872 --> 01:15:30.482
I saw you with her, Owen.

01:15:32.005 --> 01:15:32.963
Julia!

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:35.618
I don't know
what you think you saw,

01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:37.184
but it was nothing.

01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:38.795
I'm here with you,

01:15:38.838 --> 01:15:39.883
aren't I?

01:15:39.926 --> 01:15:41.667
I can't do this right now.

01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:43.234
This night
is way too important to me.

01:15:43.277 --> 01:15:44.540
I know,
but we need to talk about it.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:46.324
No, we don't.

01:15:46.367 --> 01:15:48.369
I told myself
that I would stay focused,

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:50.023
that I would not get distracted,

01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:51.416
that I'd focus
on my career first,

01:15:51.459 --> 01:15:52.678
and then...

01:15:52.722 --> 01:15:53.984
Now look at me!
I just spent the past hour

01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:55.594
worried
about a girl I don't even know,

01:15:55.638 --> 01:15:57.248
and a guy I just met.

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:00.556
Why don't we talk about it
when I take you home?

01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:04.821
Actually, I'm going to...

01:16:04.864 --> 01:16:06.039
I'm going to get a ride home
with Sherry.

01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:07.650
Are you serious?

01:16:07.693 --> 01:16:08.868
I just can't do this right now.

01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:11.741
Julia!

01:16:13.394 --> 01:16:14.744
You keep saying you want
to lead with love for King...

01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:19.618
but you can't even do it
for yourself.

01:16:19.662 --> 01:16:20.924
I'm sorry.

01:17:10.713 --> 01:17:12.279
What's up, buddy? Huh?

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:17.415
I know, King.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.200
I'm sad, too,
but it's just...

01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:22.463
less complicated this way.

01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:23.595
We just need
to stay focused, okay?

01:17:25.771 --> 01:17:28.208
Hey, you want some salmon?

01:17:28.252 --> 01:17:29.296
Come on,
let's go get some salmon.

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:30.515
Come on.

01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:34.432
Well, I think we have
one more free shelf.

01:17:34.475 --> 01:17:37.348
Well, that should hold us
for another week, tops.

01:17:38.741 --> 01:17:39.959
I'm kidding.

01:17:40.003 --> 01:17:41.526
Oh...

01:17:44.485 --> 01:17:45.486
Bad day to joke?

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:47.010
Mm...

01:17:47.053 --> 01:17:48.054
Yeah, maybe.

01:17:48.098 --> 01:17:49.490
Have you heard anything?

01:17:51.014 --> 01:17:52.972
No.

01:17:53.016 --> 01:17:54.931
I'm just going to stick
to what I'm good at...

01:17:56.889 --> 01:17:58.064
hanging out
with these guys.

01:17:58.108 --> 01:17:59.849
That's probably
a good idea...

01:17:59.892 --> 01:18:03.156
and if you want,
you could just move in with us.

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.767
We could order pizza
every night,

01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:05.855
just the three of us,

01:18:05.898 --> 01:18:07.247
until we're old and gray.

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:09.075
You know
I'd personally love that,

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:11.034
but just so you know,

01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:11.991
you're better
at this whole love thing

01:18:12.035 --> 01:18:12.949
than you think.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.866
I think...

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.393
there's still space on the wall
for one more.

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:28.660
Don't give up.

01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:35.188
Well, I feel like a debutante

01:18:35.232 --> 01:18:36.886
after a coming out ball.

01:18:36.929 --> 01:18:38.757
We've already gotten
two phone calls, four emails...

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:40.716
it's not even noon.

01:18:40.759 --> 01:18:41.804
That's terrific.

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:45.633
Good.

01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:47.418
Well then,

01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:49.986
I am going to go make us
a super strong pot of coffee,

01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:52.162
because I have
a feeling

01:18:52.205 --> 01:18:54.207
that today
is going to be a busy one.

01:19:07.873 --> 01:19:08.831
I might need
those, buddy.

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:15.489
You got a call
from someone named Molly?

01:19:15.533 --> 01:19:17.796
I couldn't quite
make out the message,

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.276
but it was something
about a fair?

01:19:25.543 --> 01:19:27.066
Yes.

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:28.198
Thank you, Mr. Salas.

01:19:28.241 --> 01:19:29.765
We look forward
to seeing you soon.

01:19:31.505 --> 01:19:32.419
He wants us to work
on his new restaurant,

01:19:32.463 --> 01:19:33.812
doesn't he?

01:19:33.856 --> 01:19:35.118
Yeah, it looks like it.

01:19:35.161 --> 01:19:36.597
I knew it!

01:19:36.641 --> 01:19:37.598
That is amazing.

01:19:37.642 --> 01:19:39.383
Do you realize
how amazing that is?

01:19:39.426 --> 01:19:41.646
Yeah, I do.
It is... it is.

01:19:44.649 --> 01:19:46.651
Wait, maybe
I'm missing something, but...

01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:49.219
why don't you call him?

01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:50.220
You know you want to.

01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:51.917
What are you talking about?

01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:53.049
Please.

01:19:53.092 --> 01:19:54.224
We've known each other
for six years.

01:19:54.267 --> 01:19:55.312
I think you know
who I'm talking about.

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:00.447
You should've seen them
together.

01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:02.928
Her, actually.
She was... perfect.

01:20:05.104 --> 01:20:06.932
It felt awful.

01:20:06.976 --> 01:20:08.064
I can't be distracted

01:20:08.107 --> 01:20:09.543
by a guy who isn't
even over his ex,

01:20:09.587 --> 01:20:12.285
and even if he is,
it's just...

01:20:12.329 --> 01:20:14.853
it's just too much
right now, right?

01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:17.464
Right.
I get that...

01:20:17.508 --> 01:20:19.553
but from
where I was standing,

01:20:19.597 --> 01:20:20.641
he was chasing you,

01:20:20.685 --> 01:20:22.948
not her...

01:20:22.992 --> 01:20:25.342
and you did all of this
with him in the picture...

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.954
but you really need to feel that
for yourself.

01:20:28.998 --> 01:20:30.956
I do. I mean...

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.436
I did. I just...

01:20:32.479 --> 01:20:33.959
Got scared?

01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:36.614
Maybe.

01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:38.659
Well...

01:20:38.703 --> 01:20:41.184
then maybe you need
to chase him back.

01:20:43.751 --> 01:20:45.057
We're good to go.

01:20:45.101 --> 01:20:46.319
You ready to tell
your story?

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.756
Yeah.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.281
You want to know if there was
a lot of early mornings?

01:20:51.324 --> 01:20:52.891
Yes.

01:20:52.935 --> 01:20:54.675
To be honest, I had no idea

01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:56.416
just how much a dog
would change my life,

01:20:56.460 --> 01:20:59.158
but he did...

01:20:59.202 --> 01:21:03.336
and it took us a while
to figure each other out...

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:06.426
what we needed,
what we needed to work on...

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:08.689
but then
it just sort of clicked...

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:17.002
and it didn't matter how much
more complicated my life was

01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:18.569
because of it,

01:21:18.612 --> 01:21:20.919
because of him.

01:21:20.963 --> 01:21:22.181
All I kept thinking about

01:21:22.225 --> 01:21:25.010
was how much richer my life was

01:21:25.054 --> 01:21:26.490
for having him in it.

01:21:28.492 --> 01:21:32.061
It is the best kind
of distraction.

01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:40.286
Okay, I think
we'll wrap this up.

01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:41.853
Who wants to meet
the other dogs?

01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:53.734
I'm not really sure

01:21:53.778 --> 01:21:54.866
that you want to see me
right now,

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.478
but I wanted
to give you these.

01:21:58.522 --> 01:22:01.090
You wanted to bring me
dog toys?

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:05.877
I wanted to test your whole
"lead with love" theory.

01:22:08.749 --> 01:22:09.750
Okay?

01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:12.405
Here.

01:22:16.322 --> 01:22:17.280
The truth is...

01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:19.978
I'm going to choose you
every time,

01:22:20.022 --> 01:22:22.241
because what we have

01:22:22.285 --> 01:22:23.808
is and will always be
worth fighting for.

01:22:27.899 --> 01:22:30.423
I'm sorry
that I doubted you, Owen.

01:22:30.467 --> 01:22:32.382
It was just...

01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:33.426
it was just kind of a lot,
and I just...

01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:35.124
I just froze.

01:22:35.167 --> 01:22:36.473
It's okay.

01:22:36.516 --> 01:22:38.823
I think we were both just
working out the kinks.

01:22:40.868 --> 01:22:42.218
Should we say
it was a warm-up?

01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:43.262
Yeah.

01:22:58.712 --> 01:22:59.844
Okay, King.

01:23:00.888 --> 01:23:01.672
Here.

01:23:21.866 --> 01:23:22.823
Come on!

01:23:24.129 --> 01:23:25.174
Come on.
