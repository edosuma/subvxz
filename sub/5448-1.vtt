00:27.111 --> 00:29.904
A shadow shall fall
over the universe...

00:30.072 --> 00:32.782
...and evil will grow in its path...

00:32.950 --> 00:37.453
...and death will come
from the skies.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.224
What did you bring me?

04:27.643 --> 04:29.727
You'll see.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.980
Wait. Wait for me.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.746
What is it?

04:59.091 --> 05:02.009
Do not try to escape.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.262
You are in my control.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.848
Look at me.

05:08.392 --> 05:13.604
I am the sum of all evils.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.607
Look carefully.

05:16.775 --> 05:22.697
My power infests all times,
all galaxies...

05:22.864 --> 05:25.408
...all dimensions.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.869
But many still seek me out.

05:29.037 --> 05:33.290
A green jewel they must possess.

05:33.458 --> 05:38.421
But see how I destroy their lives.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.319
Right 12 degrees.

07:15.811 --> 07:18.229
Yeah, New York. Big deal.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.689
Scum center of the world.

07:21.399 --> 07:25.694
Now they're even talking about letting
in lowlifes from other planets too.

07:30.283 --> 07:34.245
My name's Harry Canyon.
I drive a cab.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.422
Hey, you free?

07:46.550 --> 07:48.175
Yeah, get in.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.142
-Where to, pal?
-The U.N. building.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.188
The U.N. building.

08:01.356 --> 08:06.193
What a joke. They turned it
into low-rent housing. It's a dump.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.994
Okay, sucker, hand over your cash.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.871
Now!

08:25.589 --> 08:26.964
Stupid asshole.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.967
Nobody touches Harry Canyon
unless I want them to.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.193
Father!

08:48.778 --> 08:50.571
Run!

08:55.744 --> 08:58.370
He's dead. Get the girl.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.376
Help me! Please!

09:04.878 --> 09:07.129
Normally, my rule's
don't get involved.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.882
But somehow, hey,
this dame got to me.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.014
The Loc-Nar....

09:17.182 --> 09:20.309
They-- They wanted it, but my--
My father wouldn't tell them...

09:20.477 --> 09:23.312
...and now I'm the only one.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.691
Hey, relax, sister,
there's a cop station up here.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.571
You can tell them....

09:32.739 --> 09:36.450
Oh, shit. Just what I needed.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.044
-Police. What do you want?
-I wanna report a murder.

09:47.504 --> 09:51.382
-What else is new?
-Hey, you gonna let me in or what?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.676
Yeah, hang on.

09:55.178 --> 09:57.263
Harry.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.641
How you doing, Harry?

10:00.809 --> 10:02.518
Hiya, Harry.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.771
She couldn't take it, huh?

10:06.314 --> 10:08.607
Hey, kiss my ass, will you?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.110
I'll do it for 20 bucks.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.448
I told you, I'm an American citizen.
I-- I just lost my papers or something.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.701
Goddamn illegal aliens.

10:22.372 --> 10:26.000
Before you go any further, pal,
I gotta tell you, it's cash upfront.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.419
Thousand bucks a day
for a full investigation...

10:28.586 --> 10:30.713
...another thou if the assailant
is caught. Understand?

10:31.214 --> 10:34.174
Yeah. Hey, here's a dollar.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.971
Thanks for nothing.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.561
You think you can do better? Punk.

10:48.023 --> 10:52.359
So here I was,
stuck with this beautiful girl.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.362
I knew she was gonna be
nothing but trouble.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.258
Where am I?

11:17.761 --> 11:20.929
-My place.
-They'd have killed me if not for you.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.809
What did they wanna
snuff you for anyway?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.103
The Loc-Nar.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.940
An ancient relic that my father found
in the desert.

11:32.567 --> 11:36.111
It's worth a fortune,
especially to the Venusians.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.281
They think it has spiritual powers.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.950
Does it?

11:42.452 --> 11:47.122
All I know is that since we found it,
people have been dying all around us.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.376
When we got to New York,
my father hid it.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.461
Now he's dead.

11:53.046 --> 11:58.133
They'll kill me next. I'm the only one
who knows where it is. They'll....

11:58.718 --> 12:01.261
Listen, nobody's gonna
find you here.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.975
You can sleep on the couch
if you want.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.978
And there's beer in the fridge.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.439
So help yourself, all right?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.903
I didn't know whether
to believe her or not.

12:18.363 --> 12:22.574
Something inside me told me....
Was a sucker play.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.910
Harry?

12:26.746 --> 12:29.123
Can I sleep with you?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.836
Yeah, sure.

12:40.343 --> 12:44.179
Sucker play or not, I must have
turned her on something fierce...

12:44.347 --> 12:46.849
...because this dame
was going for broke.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.185
Or maybe it was her first time
with a New Yorker, I don't know.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.064
Anyway, nothing can beat
good old American know-how...

12:54.232 --> 12:59.194
...and I was giving this broad
the stars and stripes forever.

13:09.998 --> 13:13.792
-Where's the girl?
-Where--? What--? What girl?

13:15.462 --> 13:19.339
Don't play dumb with me, cabby.
You showed up at the station...

13:19.507 --> 13:21.758
...with a broad over your shoulder.
Where is she?

13:22.218 --> 13:24.094
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:24.262 --> 13:28.265
Listen, cabbie,
you hear from her, you call us.

13:28.433 --> 13:32.436
You don't, you're dead. Understand?

13:32.604 --> 13:35.063
Don't hold your breath, pal.

13:42.572 --> 13:46.950
-Where's the girl?
-Come on. Not again.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.954
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.958
I'll get right to the point,
Mr. Canyon.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.961
My name is Rudnick.

13:58.338 --> 14:04.134
I represent a group of investors
from a nearby planet...

14:04.302 --> 14:09.139
...who wish to purchase something
from the young lady.

14:09.641 --> 14:15.145
The price is fair, but they're
starting to get very restless.

14:15.772 --> 14:21.068
When you see her,
tell her that time is running out.

14:21.236 --> 14:25.572
Thank you, Mr. Canyon. Good day.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.955
The burning smell kept reminding me
I shouldn't have got involved.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.583
But for some reason,
I just couldn't get her off my mind.

14:36.918 --> 14:40.254
There was something about her.
An element of danger.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.798
It really turned me on.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.108
Transcom Message Service.

15:01.276 --> 15:05.654
Message for Harry Canyon.
Will you accept the charges?

15:07.782 --> 15:11.952
Meet female acquaintance
at Statue of Liberty, 4:00.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.247
Stop. End message.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.334
The girl. Had to be her.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.306
But first, I had to ditch
a couple assholes.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.724
That's what all
the excitement's about?

16:15.892 --> 16:17.267
I wanna get rid of it, Harry.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.812
I want this to be over.
I talked to Rudnick.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.274
He said he'd give me
300,000 Krono-dollars for it.

16:24.442 --> 16:28.362
But-- But I'm frightened.
I don't trust him.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.697
Three hundred grand
is a lot of dough.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.032
Will you help me?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.784
When she looked at me like that...

16:35.203 --> 16:36.912
...I knew I couldn't say no.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.247
I'll come along for 50 percent
of the take.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.084
You can have anything you want.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.670
Just stay with me.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.430
There they are.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.686
Okay. I'll keep you covered.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.705
Hey, baby, we're rich.

18:01.873 --> 18:05.000
What do you say we take a trip?
Hey, just the two of us.

18:05.418 --> 18:09.087
I'd like to, Harry,
but I've made other plans.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.173
I'm taking it all.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.258
Pull over.

18:16.888 --> 18:20.557
-Are you sure this is what you want?
-Positive.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.316
Pretty, but dumb.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.238
You know, even though she would've
killed me, I kind of felt sorry for her.

18:35.406 --> 18:39.201
She was okay, just a little greedy.

18:39.368 --> 18:45.207
As for me, I put it down as
a two-day ride with one hell of a tip.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.927
You've had your first lesson,
young one.

19:01.224 --> 19:06.394
My evil corrupts the most innocent.

19:08.022 --> 19:13.610
I've chosen you
because you possess powers...

19:13.778 --> 19:18.073
...you do not yet understand.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.076
Look again.

19:21.244 --> 19:24.621
Look deep into me.

19:24.789 --> 19:30.418
In some worlds,
I'm worshipped as God.

19:38.261 --> 19:41.972
It all started when I found
the green meteorite.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.851
I read in Faraday's Life of the Planets
that smaller ones like this...

19:46.018 --> 19:48.687
...are supposed to burn up
when they enter the atmosphere.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.814
But for some reason,
this one didn't.

19:50.982 --> 19:54.776
So I brought it to my room, stuck it in
my rock collection and forgot about it.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.946
I was experimenting
with natural electricity...

19:58.114 --> 20:02.450
...and with the storm warnings up,
I figured tonight I'd hit the jackpot.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.119
All I needed was a little juice.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.470
It works!

21:04.513 --> 21:06.348
No hair.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.184
Big.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.811
There was no way I was gonna
walk around this place...

21:11.979 --> 21:14.147
...with my dork hanging out.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.864
This looked like something
right out of The Ten Commandments.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.034
Ullatec

21:26.202 --> 21:29.037
Ullatec

21:29.330 --> 21:32.624
Ullatec

21:34.794 --> 21:40.215
By the powers of the glowing Loc-Nar
placed in your idol's hand...

21:40.383 --> 21:44.552
...I demand you come forth, Ullatec!

21:45.388 --> 21:50.684
Grant me your strength in return
for a living mortal sacrifice.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.686
It has been ordained.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.523
Come forth, Ullatec. I demand it.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.527
What'd they do that for?

22:26.387 --> 22:28.304
Normally, I'd be dead by now.

22:28.472 --> 22:32.767
I kept thinking I was gonna run out
of air, but my new body worked great.

22:32.935 --> 22:36.104
I just hoped her body was working
as good as mine.

22:51.746 --> 22:53.455
Thank you.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.957
She had the most beautiful eyes.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.085
I wanted to make some conversation,
but I found my new self...

22:59.253 --> 23:01.463
...asking the same old
stupid questions.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.299
Are you from around here?

23:04.592 --> 23:07.552
Well, you may not believe this,
but I'm from another world...

23:07.720 --> 23:09.804
...from a place called Earth.

23:09.972 --> 23:12.307
Earth? I, too, am from Earth.

23:12.850 --> 23:17.312
My name is Katherine Wells, and I'm
from the British colony of Gibraltar.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.022
You saved my life.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.982
I have no reward to give you...

23:21.150 --> 23:25.779
...but if any part of me
pleases your senses...

23:26.238 --> 23:29.616
...I would give it to you willingly.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.170
This was great.

23:42.505 --> 23:45.924
There was no way I'd get
a chick like this back on Earth.

23:46.592 --> 23:48.551
There was only one problem.

23:49.804 --> 23:51.179
Come.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.390
I don't know
who these assholes were...

23:54.558 --> 23:57.644
...but they sure picked
a bad time to show up.

24:10.032 --> 24:14.119
They split us up and took me
to this weird castle-type place.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.381
I wanted to find out
where they'd taken Katherine...

24:26.549 --> 24:28.758
...but none of these guys
seemed to speak English.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.720
They tell me you are Den of Earth.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.724
The one who dared to steal
the female sacrifice from the queen.

24:36.892 --> 24:40.562
This guy was a shrimp,
so I figured I'd play it tough.

24:40.729 --> 24:41.729
Where is the girl?

24:41.981 --> 24:43.481
I am Ard...

24:43.649 --> 24:47.902
...supreme leader of the revolution
and the next ruler of the world.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.237
The girl!

24:49.405 --> 24:51.906
Well, aren't we fierce?

24:52.241 --> 24:54.409
Guards, castrate him.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.799
Boy, I was pretty good at this stuff.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.512
Excellent. You are worthy
to serve me.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.139
Give me the girl or die.

25:16.307 --> 25:20.685
-Well, if I have a choice, I'll take death.
-So be it.

25:24.148 --> 25:26.608
You'll have to do better than that.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.861
I could see why they made
this guy their leader.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.281
But if you're really interested
in the girl...

25:36.243 --> 25:38.620
...I've had her encased in glass.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.543
-She's dead.
-Actually, no. She's sleeping.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.880
-But only I can awaken her.
-What do you want of me?

25:49.506 --> 25:51.841
I want you to steal
the sacred Loc-Nar.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.386
-What is this Loc-Nar?
-The queen's glowing sphere, fool.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.931
The sacrifice to Ullatec
can only be performed...

25:58.098 --> 26:00.183
...by the possessor
of the sacred Loc-Nar.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.227
Norl!

26:04.271 --> 26:07.065
This is Norl, my bravest warrior.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.652
You will go with him to the queen's
castle and steal the Loc-Nar.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.780
-Then I will give you the girl.
-And if I refuse?

26:13.948 --> 26:18.159
If you refuse, you die,
she dies, everybody dies.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.037
Sounded reasonable to me.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.778
Guard post ahead.
We must go underground.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.663
This guy Norl seemed to know
what he was doing.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.124
And for a gorilla,
his English wasn't half bad.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.211
We're underneath the castle moat.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.260
What are they saying?

27:17.428 --> 27:19.846
They talk of the beast
who prowls these catacombs...

27:20.014 --> 27:24.100
...with a fierce hunger
and sharp teeth 6 inches long.

27:24.893 --> 27:28.021
Sorry, 16 inches long.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.703
Now we separate.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.123
You and Korg take this door
into the queen's quarters.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.167
The rest will move
through the walls...

27:49.335 --> 27:51.461
...and enter her chamber
from the other side.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.964
Whoever gets the Loc-Nar first
will return it to Ard.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.966
Good luck, Den.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.601
Loc-Nar.

28:08.020 --> 28:11.439
It was just like the ball
I dug up in the yard.

28:12.399 --> 28:16.986
As I saw the Loc-Nar's glow,
I had this real funny feeling.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.947
Then the lights came on.
Talk about embarrassing.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.199
Kill them.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.162
Can I slit his throat, Your Majesty?

28:26.997 --> 28:29.665
Yes, slit his throat.

28:29.833 --> 28:31.167
Thank you, Your Majesty.

28:31.335 --> 28:35.671
Stop! I have.... I have
something better in mind.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.508
-Come with me.
-Jeez, not again.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.676
This always happens.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.012
She's the queen.
She can do whatever she wants.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.014
-Yeah, sure.
-Sure.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.186
If you please me, I may let you live.

28:52.189 --> 28:56.025
-What must I do?
-Satisfy my appetites.

28:58.570 --> 29:03.866
Eighteen years of nothing, and now
twice in one day. What a place.

29:25.556 --> 29:29.183
The rising moon
climaxes our love, Den.

29:29.351 --> 29:32.770
-It is a sign.
-Yes, a sign.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.106
I had no idea
what she was talking about.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.900
Neverwhere is a troubled land.

29:38.068 --> 29:41.988
Your strength has brought great peace
to my restless body.

29:42.197 --> 29:46.492
It could bring great peace to all
the troubled people of this land.

29:46.660 --> 29:50.204
I knew I was good,
but I didn't know I was that good.

29:51.248 --> 29:54.625
Your Majesty,
the Loc-Nar is missing! Stolen!

29:54.793 --> 29:58.629
Fiend! You make love to me while
your accomplice steals my scepter.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.466
Now Ard will perform the sacrifice.

30:01.633 --> 30:07.138
Guards! Take him! Hold him still.
I will kill him myself.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.682
Boy, was she pissed off.

30:18.901 --> 30:24.489
Prepare the fliers! I want his head!

30:35.626 --> 30:40.963
By the power of the magic Loc-Nar
placed in your hands...

30:41.548 --> 30:43.007
...I command you.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.677
Come forth, Ullatec!

31:17.084 --> 31:18.709
Here is your sacrifice.

31:18.919 --> 31:23.256
Ullatec, now give me your power.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.049
Throw her in.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.302
-Katherine!
-Den!

31:28.470 --> 31:30.555
No! You'll ruin everything.

31:35.018 --> 31:38.229
-Kill them! Kill them both!
-The Loc-Nar is mine!

31:38.397 --> 31:40.731
-Stupid bitch. Get away from me.
-Give it to me.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.900
-Give it to me.
-The Loc-Nar's mine.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.193
Don't you take it.

31:44.361 --> 31:46.279
I know what a Loc-Nar is.
It's my Loc-Nar.

32:36.872 --> 32:40.207
-Where did they go?
-They're gone. That's all that matters.

32:41.043 --> 32:44.378
They probably went back to Earth.
Boy, will Mom be surprised.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.839
The Loc-Nar.

32:47.049 --> 32:51.719
You could have the power of Ullatec.
You could be ruler of all these people.

32:51.887 --> 32:52.887
Forget it.

33:05.984 --> 33:10.780
But, Den, with the Loc-Nar,
you could've returned to Earth.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.782
I like it better here.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.077
On Earth, I'm nobody.

33:16.244 --> 33:19.538
But here, I'm Den.

33:22.459 --> 33:26.420
Even when someone has
the strength to discard me...

33:27.422 --> 33:31.342
...my power is not diminished.

33:58.787 --> 34:02.790
Someone always finds me.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.967
Are you Captain Lincoln F. Sternn?

34:13.301 --> 34:15.052
I am.

34:26.732 --> 34:30.317
Lincoln Sternn,
you stand here accused...

34:30.485 --> 34:33.821
...of 12 counts of murder
in the first degree...

34:34.239 --> 34:38.284
...14 counts of armed theft
of Federation property...

34:38.702 --> 34:41.996
...22 counts of piracy
in high space...

34:42.706 --> 34:45.498
...18 counts of fraud...

34:45.667 --> 34:48.002
...37 counts of rape...

34:50.547 --> 34:53.174
...and one moving violation.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.595
How do you plead?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.519
Not guilty.

35:19.659 --> 35:21.494
Not guilty? Are you nuts?

35:21.661 --> 35:25.164
It's okay, Charlie. I got an angle.

35:25.332 --> 35:27.374
Call the first witness.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.710
But the prosecutor's got you cold.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.379
You're as guilty as a cat
in a goldfish bowl.

35:32.714 --> 35:35.549
The prosecution calls
Hanover Fiste.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.551
Calling Hanover Fiste.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.304
-Hanover Fiste.
-Calling Hanover Fiste.

35:52.359 --> 35:55.319
Listen, Sternn,
change the plea to guilty.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.363
Throw yourself
on the mercy of the court.

35:57.531 --> 36:00.908
I told you, Charlie, I got an angle.

36:01.076 --> 36:04.328
But the most we can hope for
is to get you buried in secrecy...

36:04.496 --> 36:06.747
...so your grave don't get violated.

36:06.915 --> 36:09.500
-Plead guilty.
-Shut up, Charlie.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.919
I got an angle.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.754
What angle?

36:14.589 --> 36:16.006
Him.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.469
State your name for the record.

36:20.971 --> 36:23.514
I am Hanover Fiste.

36:23.682 --> 36:27.184
You know the defendant,
Captain Sternn?

36:27.352 --> 36:29.728
Yes, I know Captain Sternn.

36:29.896 --> 36:34.066
And never did there live a kinder,
more generous man.

36:34.234 --> 36:38.696
I promised him 35,000 zuleks
to testify on my behalf.

36:40.740 --> 36:47.079
He's an overflowing cup, filled with
the very cream of human goodness.

36:47.455 --> 36:53.252
In all the time I've known him,
he's never done anything immoral.

36:53.587 --> 36:55.129
See?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.885
Unless maybe
the preschoolers' prostitute ring.

37:03.138 --> 37:08.225
And he's never done
anything illegal--

37:08.393 --> 37:12.980
Unless you count all the times
he sold dope disguised as a nun.

37:15.984 --> 37:20.070
He's always been a good,
law-abiding citizen--

37:21.031 --> 37:23.574
Give me a break!

37:24.659 --> 37:26.368
--of the Federation, and-- And--

37:26.536 --> 37:28.621
Shut up. Shut up!

37:28.788 --> 37:31.999
--a community-conscious individual.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.751
Sternn.

37:33.919 --> 37:38.047
He's nothing but a low-down,
double-dealing...

37:38.214 --> 37:44.011
...backstabbing, larcenous,
perverted worm.

37:44.554 --> 37:46.722
Hanging's too good for him.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.974
Burning's too good for him.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.768
-Hanover....
-He should be torn...

37:50.936 --> 37:55.189
...into little bitsy pieces
and buried alive!

37:55.565 --> 37:57.191
Hanover....

37:57.359 --> 38:01.987
I'll kill him. Kill!

38:11.623 --> 38:13.666
Kill!

38:19.631 --> 38:25.803
Hey, hey, Hanover, take it easy.
I'm sure we can talk this over.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.221
Good.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.390
Lost him.

40:05.487 --> 40:08.655
Sternn!

40:19.084 --> 40:24.088
Okay, Hanover,
you've had this coming.

40:24.255 --> 40:25.672
Now, let's see.

40:26.257 --> 40:30.052
Thirty-three, 34...

40:30.220 --> 40:32.971
...35,000 zuleks.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.933
Thanks, Hanover.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.688
-It's nothing, boss.
-And, Hanover.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.025
-Yes?
-Goodbye.

40:55.620 --> 40:59.498
Very few escape my grasp.

40:59.958 --> 41:04.586
Even in death, my powers continue.

41:04.587 --> 41:05.671
Even in death, my powers continue.

41:55.430 --> 41:58.849
Come on, Stefan. Drop the fuckers
and let's get the hell out of here.

42:28.171 --> 42:29.421
We're hit pretty bad, Skip.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.715
You'd better go back
and see how bad it is.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.467
Okay.

42:33.635 --> 42:36.720
-Can you keep her in the air, Skip?
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

43:14.509 --> 43:16.134
Nelson?

43:51.838 --> 43:53.046
Jeez.

43:57.385 --> 44:00.053
Skip, something's following us.

44:00.888 --> 44:04.391
-What is it?
-It's some kind of green meteorite.

44:04.559 --> 44:07.436
What? Where?

44:43.014 --> 44:45.390
Holden, are you okay?

44:48.603 --> 44:52.981
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming back, Skip.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.073
What the hell's
happening back there?

45:44.867 --> 45:45.992
Shit.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.961
No. No!

47:34.644 --> 47:39.314
No!

47:41.901 --> 47:47.822
From one war to another,
my influence is always present.

47:48.783 --> 47:55.163
The paltry armies of the universe
are but playthings to me.

48:08.469 --> 48:10.136
Please, Dr. Anrak! Dr. Anrak!

48:10.304 --> 48:14.224
Dr. Anrak, six more mutants were
sighted in Arizona this morning.

48:14.392 --> 48:17.894
Do you still say this has nothing to do
with the green radiation from space?

48:20.314 --> 48:24.442
Doctor, is it true that the president
pulled you off the Jupiter Six project...

48:24.610 --> 48:26.653
...so you could investigate
those mutations?

48:26.821 --> 48:28.488
Doctor, answer me that, please.

48:28.656 --> 48:31.491
Please, the green radiations
from space....

48:37.915 --> 48:41.293
Well, what I wanna know is,
what's the Army doing about this?

48:41.460 --> 48:44.045
Hell, my constituents
are turning green.

48:44.213 --> 48:46.339
They're growing arms
on their backs.

48:46.507 --> 48:49.843
There's something or someone
up there in space...

48:50.011 --> 48:52.137
...and voters have
a right to know about it.

48:52.513 --> 48:54.180
Senator, we have no proof...

48:54.348 --> 48:57.934
...that these mutations are the result
of interference from outer space.

48:58.102 --> 49:01.688
In fact, Dr. Anrak has just come in,
so let's hear what he has to say.

49:01.856 --> 49:05.609
-Doctor?
-First of all, there's no cause for alarm.

49:06.444 --> 49:09.738
As for the theories of interference
by alien beings...

49:09.905 --> 49:12.741
...it is my firm opinion
that we on Earth...

49:12.908 --> 49:16.411
...are the only intelligent,
technically advanced civilization...

49:16.579 --> 49:19.080
...present in the universe.

49:19.248 --> 49:20.832
-Thank goodness.
-That's a relief.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.335
I was scared for a while, you know.

49:23.919 --> 49:26.755
Very reassuring, very reassuring.

49:28.549 --> 49:32.719
And-- And whatever is causing
these mutations...

49:32.887 --> 49:35.555
...is not from outer space.

49:37.558 --> 49:43.063
It's more likely just an isolated
biological phenomen--

49:52.239 --> 49:54.115
Pretty. Pretty.

50:15.262 --> 50:16.388
What is this? Doctor!

50:34.990 --> 50:37.784
Oh, nice job.

50:39.078 --> 50:41.371
How am I gonna fix this guy?
He's fucked.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.665
Guess we turned it up
a little too high.

50:44.041 --> 50:47.168
-Sorry, man.
-You're sorry. What about me?

50:47.336 --> 50:50.088
I gotta put this asshole
back together.

50:54.260 --> 50:57.178
-Where am I?
-Hey, who's the chick?

50:57.346 --> 50:59.305
Look at my clothes.

50:59.473 --> 51:02.016
Who's gonna pay
for the dry cleaning?

51:02.393 --> 51:06.062
I demand you return me
to my office immediately.

51:07.440 --> 51:10.650
Too late. Molecular--
Molecular instabilities...

51:10.818 --> 51:13.236
...all around the spacecraft.
You cannot leave.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.697
What? Is he kidding?

51:17.032 --> 51:20.368
Oh, yeah. Instability zone.
You're stuck here.

51:20.536 --> 51:22.954
But I have to be at my parents'
for dinner tonight.

51:23.122 --> 51:25.665
And my gynecologist appointment
is on Wednesday.

51:25.833 --> 51:28.835
Not anymore.
Would you like a drink?

51:29.003 --> 51:30.503
Come with me.

51:31.297 --> 51:34.340
You'll feel better after a glass
of fresh blo-aak.

51:34.800 --> 51:37.093
You have any diet soda?

51:38.763 --> 51:40.722
Oh, typical robot.

51:40.890 --> 51:43.057
The first Earth chick we see
in 10 years...

51:43.225 --> 51:45.935
...and he's gotta make a play for her.

52:08.626 --> 52:12.003
Hey, do we have any of that
Plutonian nyborg left?

52:12.880 --> 52:15.256
Yeah. Just one bag.

52:15.424 --> 52:17.675
It's in the transmitter compartment.

52:17.843 --> 52:19.677
Thanks, man.

52:23.641 --> 52:26.476
Oh, great.

52:33.234 --> 52:34.776
Think this is enough?

52:36.654 --> 52:40.114
-No, go for broke.
-Good thinking, man.

52:49.500 --> 52:52.126
-Nosedive!
-Nosedive!

53:48.642 --> 53:50.935
Good nyborg.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.615
That was incredible.

54:04.199 --> 54:06.826
I've never felt anything like it.

54:06.994 --> 54:10.997
Oh, great. I've been programmed to be
fully proficient in sexual activities.

54:11.165 --> 54:14.542
-Do you want to go steady?
-Gee, I don't know.

54:14.710 --> 54:17.545
I already have a boyfriend, but....

54:18.213 --> 54:21.174
What he does not know
will not hurt him.

54:21.842 --> 54:24.552
But I'd feel so guilty.

54:25.387 --> 54:26.763
Of course you would.

54:26.931 --> 54:30.516
Earth women who experience sexual
ecstasy with mechanical assistance...

54:30.684 --> 54:32.936
...always tend to feel guilty.

54:33.103 --> 54:34.354
Really?

54:43.280 --> 54:46.074
But I don't understand.
We laugh together...

54:46.241 --> 54:49.118
...care for each other.
We have highly proficient sex.

54:49.286 --> 54:51.496
Why can't we get married?

54:51.664 --> 54:55.375
Look, we're different, okay?
Let's leave it at that.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.877
What do you mean, different?

54:58.045 --> 55:01.297
But mixed marriages
just don't work.

55:02.383 --> 55:06.886
I'm afraid that I'll come home one day
and find you screwing the toaster.

55:07.054 --> 55:09.222
You'll just have to trust me.

55:13.352 --> 55:17.397
All right, all right, I'll marry you.
But on one condition:

55:17.564 --> 55:19.190
I want a Jewish wedding.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.443
A Jewish wedding? Okay.

55:25.364 --> 55:28.074
I forgot, are you circumcised?

56:10.659 --> 56:12.744
You okay to land this thing?

56:13.037 --> 56:15.538
No problem, man.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.459
I think you're going
a little high, man.

56:19.626 --> 56:20.960
It's okay, man.

56:21.128 --> 56:24.922
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to drive when I'm stoned.

56:25.090 --> 56:27.050
Like, you know
your perspective's fucked...

56:27.217 --> 56:31.679
...so you just gotta let your hands
work the controls as if you're straight.

56:47.696 --> 56:49.363
Good landing, man.

56:57.331 --> 57:00.625
My stories are almost over.

57:02.294 --> 57:04.670
I have chosen you...

57:04.838 --> 57:09.967
...because you are the future
who could destroy me.

57:10.135 --> 57:16.474
With your death,
I break the chain for all time.

57:16.892 --> 57:22.730
Look into me one final time.

57:24.024 --> 57:29.362
See my evil destroy your race.

57:29.696 --> 57:33.241
Then prepare to die.

59:37.157 --> 59:38.616
Death.

59:39.910 --> 59:41.494
Death!

59:41.828 --> 59:46.290
Death to all who oppose us!

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:03.975
To the council chambers!

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:58.237
They're killing everyone.
We must escape.

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:01.032
The city is burning.

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.784
Elder, we must arm ourselves.

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:05.369
We must fight.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.413
Silence!

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:10.916
We are not a race of warriors.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.919
We are statesmen and scientists.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.755
From our very beginning,
it was ordained...

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:18.215
...that the warrior race
of Taarak the Defender...

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:23.137
...would aid us in times of need.
This was the pact.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:28.225
Taarak the Defender?
His race is dead.

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:30.603
They cannot defend anyone.

01:01:30.771 --> 01:01:34.565
Some say that the race is not dead,
that one still lives.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:37.276
One? What good is one?

01:01:37.444 --> 01:01:40.696
One of Taarak's blood can do much.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.407
Elder, they're in the hall!

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:50.873
Well, who is this last Defender?
How can he be summoned?

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:57.171
It is Taarna, of the blood of Taarak
the Defender, the last of the race...

01:01:57.339 --> 01:02:02.009
...and must be summoned as my
forefathers summoned Taarak himself:

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:04.470
From within.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.597
But will this Defender answer?

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:09.850
A Taarakian has no choice.
They must answer.

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:11.644
It is in their blood.

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.730
They're at the door.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.190
They're here!

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:18.359
In the halls, quickly.
We must do something.

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:20.152
Bar the door.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:24.740
We will summon
the Defender together.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:30.329
Taarna.

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:34.166
Taarna.

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:38.921
Taarna.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.591
Taarna.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:46.637
Taarna.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:31.398
To defend, this is the pact.

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:35.778
But when life loses its value
and is taken for naught...

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:38.906
...then the pact is to avenge.

01:13:18.686 --> 01:13:22.147
Hey, look. A new one.

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:24.608
Where you from, baby?

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:29.196
Doesn't talk much, does she?

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:33.950
She doesn't have to talk
for what I wanna do with her.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:39.706
Come on, baby,
let's see what's under there.

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:52.260
Hey, she's tough.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:54.971
Maybe she wants to fight.

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:58.725
Or maybe she wants
to take us all on.

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:50.193
You'll find them over there,
beyond the oasis...

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:53.029
...towards the green glow.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:46.666
A Taarakian.
We have captured a Taarakian.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.752
A Taarakian?

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.587
Are you sure?

01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:52.589
Yes, Your Holiness.

01:15:55.593 --> 01:15:58.637
But the Taarakian race is dead...

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.222
...extinct.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:03.683
She has the marks, Holiness.
I saw them.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:09.731
Have her bound and washed.

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:12.484
Then...

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:16.446
...bring her to me.

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:20.659
And what of the bird?

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:24.663
Kill it.

01:16:45.685 --> 01:16:47.602
So this is the Taarakian.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:54.526
Somehow, I thought
it would be more difficult...

01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:57.153
...to capture a Taarakian.

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:05.996
My whips.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.831
Pull him down.
I'll put an arrow through his head.

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:23.948
Mount the bats!

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:27.327
I want her dead!

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:42.003
This time you die, Taarakian bitch!

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:04.502
Taarna.

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:10.049
Do not sacrifice yourself.

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:16.097
You cannot destroy me.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:32.238
No!

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.954
No!

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:48.004
No!

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:15.133
And the spirit of Taarna
is transferred across the universe...

01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:18.177
...to a new Defender...

01:24:18.345 --> 01:24:22.473
...and the power of evil
is contained...

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:25.601
...for another generation...

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:29.313
...and a new Taarakian is born...

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:33.067
...to protect the next.
