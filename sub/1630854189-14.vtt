WEBVTT

00:04.246 --> 00:06.839
The name's Silver.

00:06.990 --> 00:09.049
Kat Silver.

00:10.903 --> 00:12.511
License to pack.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.664
I'm the king of apartment 4B!

00:16.759 --> 00:18.925
Yo, that truck says U-Haul,

00:19.020 --> 00:20.761
but, so far, this has been
a lot of Me-Haul.

00:20.913 --> 00:23.171
Look, man, if you want me
to call you "The Muscle,"

00:23.265 --> 00:24.857
you got to act like
"The Muscle."

00:25.008 --> 00:26.250
(scoffs)

00:26.435 --> 00:28.085
I can't believe this is our
last day living together.

00:28.103 --> 00:30.771
Yeah, the end of an era.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.348
-(sighs) Okay, bye.
-Oh.

00:33.442 --> 00:35.350
Wait, wait, this is
kind of a big deal.

00:35.444 --> 00:37.928
Just think of all the memories
that happened here.

00:37.946 --> 00:39.705
You two got engaged.
After 20 years,

00:39.856 --> 00:43.116
-Max finally gave into
his feelings for me.
-(laughs)

00:43.269 --> 00:44.692
There were a lot
of good memories.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.545
There's not a room here that
Randi and I didn't have sex in.

00:46.696 --> 00:50.198
Wait, my room, too?
Dude, that's not cool.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.367
Actually, it's pretty cool.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.294
All right, Randi,
that's the last of your stuff.

00:54.446 --> 00:56.055
Oh, thanks. We'll meet you
at the elevator.

00:56.206 --> 00:57.781
You got an elevator?

00:57.800 --> 01:00.875
Dawg, I dragged your treadmill
down three flights of stairs.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.187
Sure did, Muscle.

01:04.714 --> 01:06.398
All right, I guess this is it.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.049
I'm really gonna miss
hanging out with you here.

01:08.069 --> 01:10.977
Girl, I'm gonna see you
every day this week at work

01:11.130 --> 01:12.813
and at your Super Bowl party,

01:12.965 --> 01:14.573
on my only day off.

01:14.724 --> 01:16.391
Are you sure you want
to throw a party this weekend?

01:16.410 --> 01:18.652
We already have so much
going on with me moving in.

01:18.804 --> 01:20.746
You know how much I love
throwing this party,

01:20.897 --> 01:23.415
and it'll be the first time
that we're doing it together.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.417
Plus, I'm pulling out
all the stops.

01:25.569 --> 01:27.902
Halftime show starring
Cat-y Perry. She's gonna sing

01:27.922 --> 01:30.314
"I Kissed a Cat,"
and, uh, spoiler alert,

01:30.332 --> 01:32.407
-she liked it. All right.
-(chuckles)

01:32.426 --> 01:34.668
Time for a huggle.
Let's do this.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.670
All right, whose house is this?

01:36.822 --> 01:39.005
-No longer our house!
-Whose house is this?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.324
ALL:
No longer our house!

01:40.342 --> 01:41.825
-Let's get up out of here.
-Let's go!

01:41.844 --> 01:45.104
-(cheering, yelling)
-Let's go! Yeah!

01:48.091 --> 01:49.775
Yeah, we should probably get
the rest of my stuff.

01:49.926 --> 01:51.276
Absolutely.

01:51.503 --> 01:52.760
♪<i> Me, oh, my, oh, my, oh, me</i> ♪

01:52.780 --> 01:55.239
♪<i> Nothin' wrong with you</i>
<i> but I'd rather be me.</i> ♪

01:56.099 --> 01:58.283
-Oh. (laughs)
-Morning.

01:58.510 --> 01:59.192
Good morning.

01:59.361 --> 02:00.510
Eat your heart out, Folgers,

02:00.529 --> 02:02.604
this is the best part
of waking up.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.641
Bet you never spanked
your other roommates like that.

02:05.643 --> 02:07.200
Actually, Randi once.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.869
It was dark.
I thought she was Carter.

02:09.021 --> 02:10.796
I never even saw
that right hook coming.

02:10.947 --> 02:13.298
-(both laugh)
-Getting ready for work?

02:13.450 --> 02:14.967
Yeah, just gonna
brush the ol' teeth,

02:15.194 --> 02:17.136
floss the ol' gums,
scrape the ol' tongue,

02:17.287 --> 02:20.197
and wish that I had
just said, "Yep."

02:20.199 --> 02:22.699
Look at us, living together,

02:22.792 --> 02:24.534
being the world's cutest couple.

02:24.628 --> 02:26.386
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.796
Yeah, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

02:28.891 --> 02:30.632
You know, we can use
the-the sink

02:30.651 --> 02:32.317
and the shower at the same time,

02:32.469 --> 02:34.711
but-but the toilet,
that's a solo act,

02:34.713 --> 02:37.805
and it always ends seat down,
and the crowd goes wild.

02:37.825 --> 02:38.640
(laughs)

02:38.734 --> 02:40.550
Um, where's my toothpaste?

02:40.644 --> 02:42.161
Oh, I finished yours last night.

02:42.388 --> 02:44.145
I brushed,
but then I had an Oreo,

02:44.239 --> 02:46.223
so I brushed again,
and then I had another Oreo.

02:46.316 --> 02:48.834
-It was a vicious
but delicious cycle.
-(chuckles)

02:48.985 --> 02:50.227
Here, use mine.

02:50.245 --> 02:52.412
Wow, I, uh, never realized

02:52.564 --> 02:54.414
how much bathroom stuff
you have. (chuckles)

02:54.508 --> 02:58.177
Clear skin, full heart,
can't age.

02:58.328 --> 03:00.262
Here, let me
straighten up a bit.

03:01.089 --> 03:02.014
Uh, oh, oh, hang on.

03:02.165 --> 03:03.182
What's up?

03:03.333 --> 03:05.166
Well, I-I have
an organizing system.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.501
For your medicine cabinet?

03:06.595 --> 03:08.836
Yeah. I modeled it after
my favorite Walgreens.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.690
Their manager, Arlo,
may not know inventory control,

03:11.767 --> 03:14.418
but that redheaded son of
a biscuit's shelf arrangement?

03:14.511 --> 03:15.510
Mwah.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.862
Sure. So, uh,

03:17.089 --> 03:18.530
where should I
put my shaving cream?

03:18.682 --> 03:20.273
Huh. That's a good question

03:20.367 --> 03:21.925
'cause for me, that would
go with the leg stuff,

03:21.944 --> 03:23.927
but for you, it goes
with the face stuff,

03:24.020 --> 03:25.704
but those are
lotions and serums.

03:25.931 --> 03:27.021
You know, I'm gonna
have to text Arlo

03:27.115 --> 03:28.373
and get his thoughts on this.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.209
Uh, well, you know,
why don't I just

03:30.436 --> 03:32.102
put my stuff in this cabinet
with the cleaning products?

03:32.195 --> 03:34.104
Uh, unless you got
a system for that, too.

03:34.197 --> 03:36.465
-Uh...
-Of course you do.

03:37.109 --> 03:38.032
You know what?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.276
This is your place, too.

03:39.294 --> 03:40.961
Just put your stuff
wherever you want.

03:41.113 --> 03:42.387
Thank you.

03:44.616 --> 03:45.974
(gasps)

03:47.895 --> 03:49.478
Oh...

03:50.898 --> 03:52.289
Uh...

03:52.307 --> 03:53.790
That's nice. (laughs)

03:54.718 --> 03:57.611
I'm gonna move that
as soon as he leaves.

04:00.466 --> 04:02.699
I know you're in here, Randi.

04:03.802 --> 04:05.485
I checked every room.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.821
And remember, we called

04:07.973 --> 04:09.373
no under-bedsies.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.420
Oh well, I can't find you.

04:15.572 --> 04:18.090
I guess that means
I can't give you...

04:18.241 --> 04:20.050
foam to the dome!

04:22.579 --> 04:23.578
What are you doing?

04:23.597 --> 04:24.912
What are<i> you</i> doing?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.156
I've been looking
for you for 20 minutes.

04:26.249 --> 04:28.100
I went to get pizza. I told you.

04:28.327 --> 04:29.493
I got your favorite
toppings, see?

04:29.586 --> 04:31.603
Half cheese and
half "Freeze, bitch."

04:31.755 --> 04:32.754
(shrieks)

04:32.848 --> 04:35.274
(laughs) Say hello
to my little friend.

04:35.501 --> 04:37.484
(shrieking)

04:39.521 --> 04:40.779
(laughs)

04:40.930 --> 04:42.856
(both laugh)

04:43.617 --> 04:44.950
You know what?
What hurts the most

04:45.177 --> 04:47.268
is there's no pizza in that box.

04:47.362 --> 04:48.512
(laughs)

04:48.530 --> 04:49.679
I love living with you.

04:49.698 --> 04:51.272
It's like hanging with a buddy

04:51.292 --> 04:52.440
I also want to see naked.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.367
Well, I love
living with you, too.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.353
Speaking of which,
you still haven't told me

04:56.355 --> 04:57.704
how much I owe you
for the mortgage.

04:57.856 --> 04:59.965
Oh, don't worry about it, baby,
I got you covered.

05:00.116 --> 05:02.042
Uh-uh, I can pay my own way.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.376
I am not some trophy wife.

05:03.529 --> 05:04.636
But I will let you off the hook

05:04.788 --> 05:06.120
because I know I look like one.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.289
(chuckles) Well, I'm paying
whether you here or not.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.883
I know, but it's important to me

05:10.035 --> 05:12.369
that we're equal partners
in all things.

05:12.387 --> 05:14.371
Except killing spiders.
That's your job.

05:15.057 --> 05:16.815
But if it's important
to you, Cook family rules

05:17.042 --> 05:19.876
do say I can only reject
free money one time.

05:19.878 --> 05:21.135
Okay, well, what's the damage?

05:21.229 --> 05:22.379
A thousand dollars.

05:22.472 --> 05:23.805
Oh, cool, I'll Venmo you 500.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.158
Oh, no, no, a thousand dollars
would be your half.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.492
A thousand?

05:27.719 --> 05:29.143
Yeah, is that cool?

05:29.163 --> 05:31.388
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

05:31.406 --> 05:34.482
'Cause, you know,
I got racks on racks on racks.

05:35.336 --> 05:37.077
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, that's the real pizza.

05:37.229 --> 05:38.628
-Oh, okay.
-(chuckles)

05:40.990 --> 05:41.840
Darren?

05:42.067 --> 05:44.417
Yup, special delivery
from Randi.

05:44.570 --> 05:45.761
Extra foam!

05:49.758 --> 05:52.834
All right, Margot, one hot tea

05:52.853 --> 05:54.427
for a hottie. (giggles)

05:54.580 --> 05:55.687
Thank you.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.356
And I have never said this
to a white girl before,

05:57.507 --> 06:00.484
but, damn, I wish
I had an ass like that.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.680
Oh, thank you, girl.
Have a blessed day.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.942
Why are you being so weird
and nice to everyone?

06:09.111 --> 06:10.427
Please don't tell me
you're dying.

06:10.429 --> 06:12.612
You're the only
reason I come here.

06:12.764 --> 06:14.280
My half of Carter's mortgage

06:14.357 --> 06:15.448
is a little more
than I expected,

06:15.601 --> 06:17.450
so I need every
dollar I can get.

06:17.603 --> 06:18.877
I thought about
selling my clothes

06:19.104 --> 06:21.880
but I just look too damn good
in all of them.

06:22.107 --> 06:23.440
Wait, wait, wait.
There are certain things

06:23.458 --> 06:26.051
a woman should never do,
and at the top of that list

06:26.202 --> 06:28.035
is pay rent to her boyfriend.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.554
What else is on that list?

06:29.781 --> 06:30.797
Wrinkle her brow,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.449
cut her own hair,

06:32.467 --> 06:34.634
open a cat café.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.637
I just don't want to become
dependent on a man.

06:37.789 --> 06:38.805
What if I meet Beyoncé?

06:38.957 --> 06:41.483
She's not gonna
let me get in formation.

06:42.127 --> 06:43.217
I hear you.

06:43.311 --> 06:44.811
Sisters got to be doing it

06:44.963 --> 06:46.071
for theyselves.

06:46.648 --> 06:48.073
For theyselves.

06:48.224 --> 06:51.076
I'll let that slide if you
agree that I deserve a raise.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.803
Randi, you are a partner
in this business.

06:53.897 --> 06:55.730
We couldn't do it without you,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.140
which is why I can offer you

06:57.233 --> 06:58.975
a "raise-in" scone.

06:58.994 --> 07:00.168
What?

07:01.237 --> 07:04.405
That's the Randi I love.
Do it again.

07:05.241 --> 07:06.591
So, how are things
with you and Max?

07:06.743 --> 07:07.792
You guys all settled in?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.912
Oh, me and Max?
It's great. It's really great.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.580
He's got a lot of stuff.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.990
But it's really great!

07:13.992 --> 07:16.826
Very convincing.
Totally buying it.

07:16.845 --> 07:19.086
I'm just used to
having my own space,

07:19.106 --> 07:22.499
and he's just always there.

07:22.517 --> 07:23.667
With all his stuff.

07:23.685 --> 07:25.335
But it's really great!

07:25.353 --> 07:27.003
Look at it from his perspective,

07:27.022 --> 07:28.262
you're always there too,

07:28.282 --> 07:29.448
and he can't send you to camp

07:29.599 --> 07:32.175
while he summers
in the French Riviera.

07:32.194 --> 07:34.453
It was a day camp, Mother.

07:34.680 --> 07:39.273
I had to sleep in a canoe
and fight a raccoon for food.

07:40.109 --> 07:42.777
And I had to come home
early when she got rabies.

07:42.913 --> 07:45.589
It was a terrible
summer for both of us.

07:52.881 --> 07:55.198
Okay Cat-y Perry,
it's time to bring it.

07:55.217 --> 07:56.808
The halftime show
is in two days.

07:56.885 --> 07:57.717
You are not focused,

07:57.869 --> 07:58.702
you're not even close

07:58.704 --> 08:00.127
to knowing your choreography.

08:00.222 --> 08:02.038
Let's take it
from the top, okay?

08:02.131 --> 08:03.206
Six, seven, eight.

08:03.225 --> 08:05.484
You jump to the couch.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.301
You jump to the couch.

08:07.395 --> 08:08.820
You know, I think this is why

08:08.972 --> 08:11.656
John Meower broke up
with you. I just...

08:11.808 --> 08:14.551
Hey, I got a surprise for you.

08:14.686 --> 08:15.902
Ooh, is it boxer briefs?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.496
'Cause I accidentally put yours
on this morning,

08:17.647 --> 08:19.480
and I got to tell you,
that front opening

08:19.574 --> 08:21.482
is like driving with
the windows down.

08:21.576 --> 08:24.836
I got us a new TV
for Super Bowl Sunday.

08:25.063 --> 08:27.672
(chanting):
MVP, MVP!

08:27.899 --> 08:31.267
Oh, my gosh, look at
that thing, it's huge.

08:31.327 --> 08:32.919
That's what she said.

08:32.996 --> 08:34.904
That<i> is</i> what she said,
'cause she's

08:34.998 --> 08:36.497
very confused right now.

08:36.591 --> 08:37.349
What's wrong with my TV?

08:37.500 --> 08:38.908
We can't watch the Super Bowl

08:38.927 --> 08:40.593
on something that small.

08:40.746 --> 08:43.429
It would just be... the Bowl.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.749
Okay, well, I-I don't
really want my place

08:45.767 --> 08:47.008
to look like a sports bar.

08:47.176 --> 08:48.175
I thought it was our place.

08:48.270 --> 08:49.361
And if this was a sports bar,

08:49.512 --> 08:50.862
there would be
a TV in the bathroom,

08:51.031 --> 08:52.605
which... Hold on a second.

08:52.758 --> 08:55.608
No, this thing is way too big.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.351
We'd have to get a new TV stand.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.262
I'll mount the TV on the wall.

08:59.281 --> 09:00.430
Well, where am I going to hang

09:00.448 --> 09:02.265
the caricatures of the cats?

09:02.284 --> 09:03.750
I mean, Snowball as an astronaut

09:03.860 --> 09:05.043
is not only a subtle commentary

09:05.194 --> 09:06.452
on the lack
of female representation

09:06.547 --> 09:08.755
in the space program,
it's friggin' adorable.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.716
Why are you so upset?

09:11.868 --> 09:13.610
I got this to make
your party better.

09:13.703 --> 09:15.554
Yeah, but you didn't even
check with me first.

09:15.705 --> 09:17.447
Well, I didn't know
I needed to ask permission

09:17.465 --> 09:20.041
to buy something
for our apartment.

09:20.176 --> 09:21.451
We're low on toilet paper.

09:21.469 --> 09:23.453
Should we have a meeting
before I go get some?

09:23.471 --> 09:26.306
If the toilet paper's
the size of a bus, yes.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.548
You don't like where
I put my computer,

09:27.568 --> 09:29.234
you don't like
where I put my deodorant,

09:29.461 --> 09:30.384
you don't like where
I put my socks.

09:30.462 --> 09:32.553
They're in the refrigerator.

09:32.631 --> 09:33.797
I like them cool.

09:33.815 --> 09:35.699
I get hot feet. You know that.

09:38.227 --> 09:41.471
How much do you think I can
get for this ugly-ass scarf?

09:41.489 --> 09:42.472
Hey, that's mine.

09:42.641 --> 09:44.082
And you can have it back
for 20 bucks.

09:44.309 --> 09:47.401
Act now, and I'll throw in
your ugly-ass sunglasses, too.

09:47.495 --> 09:49.904
Randi, if you can't afford
your part of the mortgage,

09:49.923 --> 09:51.923
you've got to be
honest with Carter.

09:52.075 --> 09:53.499
No, no, I can pay my half.

09:53.652 --> 09:55.093
Between extra tips,
selling a few things,

09:55.244 --> 09:57.596
and, ooh, I'm not gonna be able
to make your Super Bowl party.

09:57.747 --> 10:00.915
Why? You're my hottest friend.
I like to show you off.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.009
Well, I have to
drive Uber that day.

10:03.178 --> 10:04.844
You took a second job?

10:04.996 --> 10:07.513
Randi, you've
just got to tell him.

10:07.666 --> 10:09.332
Beyoncé will understand.

10:09.351 --> 10:10.775
She wrote "Bills, Bills, Bills."

10:10.927 --> 10:12.569
I see you, Queen B.

10:13.521 --> 10:14.762
It's fine.

10:14.856 --> 10:17.098
By the way, have you
been working out?

10:17.192 --> 10:21.344
Because you are putting
the "ass" in fantastic.

10:21.363 --> 10:23.513
I know what you're doing.

10:23.531 --> 10:25.206
And it's working.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.275
Hey-hey, I bought booze
for your Super Bowl party.

10:28.370 --> 10:29.961
All from the top shelf...

10:30.113 --> 10:32.188
-of the storage room.
-(chuckles) Great.

10:32.207 --> 10:34.540
I'm making my
Reggie White Bean Salad,

10:34.635 --> 10:35.708
my Jerry Rice Pudding,

10:35.861 --> 10:38.361
and Bill "Belichicken" Fingers.

10:38.380 --> 10:39.304
Oh, cool.

10:39.531 --> 10:41.139
Remind me, we got to
eat before we go.

10:41.366 --> 10:43.290
Actually, I don't
think I'm gonna make it.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.644
What? How can you
miss the Super Bowl?

10:46.554 --> 10:47.704
Lady stuff.

10:47.722 --> 10:49.064
Say less.

10:51.467 --> 10:53.318
You know, I think this
entertainment center

10:53.469 --> 10:55.469
is the perfect solution
to our problem.

10:55.547 --> 10:56.396
It really is.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.305
I get a place to
put my sweet new TV,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.900
and you get four more
drawers for cat crap.

11:01.052 --> 11:02.886
(laughs) All right,
let's get to it.

11:02.979 --> 11:05.388
Time for my favorite
step: Inventory.

11:05.407 --> 11:08.908
Uh, looks like we've
got some long screws

11:09.060 --> 11:10.226
and a couple of nuts.

11:10.319 --> 11:11.411
That's what she said.

11:11.505 --> 11:14.488
Nailed it. Also what she said.

11:14.582 --> 11:18.159
Ooh, we've also got
an exciting array of dowels.

11:18.253 --> 11:20.069
Whoa, what are you doing?

11:20.088 --> 11:22.180
Manly things.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.574
No, but you've got to
follow the instructions.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.426
It says here right
on the instructions.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.335
It says,
"Follow the instructions."

11:28.355 --> 11:29.095
Huh.

11:29.247 --> 11:30.914
Let's see. Step one:

11:30.932 --> 11:32.023
Build the damn thing.

11:32.250 --> 11:34.341
Step two: Napalm
life-sized zombies

11:34.419 --> 11:36.403
on my giant, kick-ass TV.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.014
Wha...

11:40.033 --> 11:40.848
Are you out of your mind?

11:40.942 --> 11:42.659
The warranty card is in there.

11:46.097 --> 11:47.539
(groans) Damn it.

11:47.690 --> 11:49.766
You know, we could've
just paid the 75 bucks

11:49.784 --> 11:50.709
to have them build it.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.359
For reference,
that's the shipping cost

11:52.528 --> 11:54.462
of all of your moisturizers.

11:55.198 --> 11:57.123
Why isn't this fitting?

11:57.292 --> 11:58.699
Because you're doing it wrong,

11:58.719 --> 12:00.777
which you would know if you
had used the instructions.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.295
I did use the instructions.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.371
Yeah, as a plate for your pizza.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.874
While you wasted a paper plate.

12:06.893 --> 12:07.875
Sorry, Mother Earth,

12:07.969 --> 12:10.211
I guess only
one of us loves you.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.397
If I'm doing it wrong,
here, you do it.

12:12.548 --> 12:14.381
Oh, fine. You know what?
I will do it.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.401
And I'm gonna use
the instructions.

12:17.128 --> 12:18.570
Zucchini.

12:19.388 --> 12:21.740
All right, uh, step 42-C:

12:21.967 --> 12:24.242
Slide the upper
edge of the left door

12:24.393 --> 12:26.652
into the lower right track.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.687
Wait, so the left door

12:28.749 --> 12:30.323
into the right track?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.992
Well, is this the left door
or the right door?

12:33.144 --> 12:34.994
How's it going?

12:35.088 --> 12:37.046
Did you build it yet?

12:38.149 --> 12:39.591
I knew this party was a mistake.

12:39.742 --> 12:40.592
The party is not the problem.

12:40.819 --> 12:42.409
The problem is this big, dumb TV

12:42.429 --> 12:44.245
that you bought
without asking me.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.672
It's not a dumb TV,
it's a smart TV.

12:46.825 --> 12:48.658
It says so right on the box.

12:48.751 --> 12:50.343
Wait, I think I got it.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.585
Seriously?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.663
Yup, the door is attached.

12:53.756 --> 12:55.014
It opens and closes.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.516
Well, call me Jesus,

12:56.668 --> 12:59.778
because I am a highly
skilled Jewish carpenter.

13:00.855 --> 13:03.597
And it only took four hours,
two calls to customer service,

13:03.617 --> 13:05.191
and one trip to urgent care.

13:05.343 --> 13:07.601
I'm sorry, I really was just
tossing that mallet at you.

13:07.695 --> 13:09.862
I didn't know that you were
gonna catch it with your...

13:10.015 --> 13:10.955
(whistles)

13:11.032 --> 13:13.107
It's okay. It finally dropped.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.443
I think he was just scared
more than anything else.

13:16.538 --> 13:20.206
Well, it was not easy,
but we did it.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.374
Yeah.

13:21.526 --> 13:24.135
-(sighs)
-We made this together.

13:24.287 --> 13:26.863
This must be how parents feel.

13:26.881 --> 13:28.139
You know, proud.

13:28.366 --> 13:29.549
And very, very tired.

13:29.701 --> 13:32.644
Also wondering, like,
was it really worth it?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.396
Let's go to bed.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.304
I told you to use
the frickin' washers!

13:43.398 --> 13:45.156
It said they were optional!

13:45.308 --> 13:46.473
Oh, where'd it say that?

13:46.568 --> 13:48.142
In the instructions
you didn't read?

13:48.236 --> 13:50.311
I need my nighttime socks.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.996
Wha...

13:58.487 --> 14:00.580
All right, last call
for Super Bowl bets.

14:00.732 --> 14:01.914
Nothing's off limits,

14:02.067 --> 14:03.399
the winner, the score,

14:03.492 --> 14:04.658
how long it'll take for
Sheila to tell her story

14:04.678 --> 14:07.328
about how she hooked up
with Terry Bradshaw.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.348
I was just trying to make
Mean Joe Greene jealous.

14:10.425 --> 14:12.408
Yes! I had "before kickoff."

14:12.427 --> 14:13.667
Carter, let it ride on

14:13.761 --> 14:16.020
"my mother insulting
my outfit before halftime."

14:16.247 --> 14:17.671
It is hideous.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.082
And I win again!

14:19.100 --> 14:21.526
Carter, send that 40 bucks
straight to my therapist.

14:22.678 --> 14:24.921
Hey, real quick
we just want to make a toast.

14:24.939 --> 14:26.531
Hold on, I need a drink.

14:30.929 --> 14:32.078
Continue.

14:32.780 --> 14:34.614
Uh, I just wanted to...

14:34.708 --> 14:36.499
Oh, you're gonna talk?

14:40.029 --> 14:41.454
Um, I just want to thank you all

14:41.606 --> 14:45.049
for coming to my annual
Super Bowl party.

14:45.201 --> 14:46.125
I thought it was<i> our</i> party.

14:46.277 --> 14:47.534
I don't recall you

14:47.629 --> 14:50.179
making football-shaped meatballs
with mozzarella laces.

14:51.116 --> 14:53.299
Anyway, uh, enjoy yourselves,

14:53.393 --> 14:54.800
and don't forget
to try the guacamole

14:54.895 --> 14:56.953
'cause... it's good.

14:57.713 --> 14:59.564
And I just want to
give a special shout-out

14:59.715 --> 15:01.624
to my personal MVP.

15:01.717 --> 15:04.402
This sick-ass 70-inch
ultra-hi-def TV.

15:04.553 --> 15:06.796
Daddy loves you.

15:06.814 --> 15:07.647
Turn it up.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.073
Yeah, the national anthem's

15:09.300 --> 15:10.658
about to start.

15:12.228 --> 15:13.411
It's not working.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.496
Thanks, Kelly. Big help.

15:16.324 --> 15:17.823
Wait, that's the old remote.

15:17.900 --> 15:18.991
Are you kidding me?

15:19.144 --> 15:20.752
Did you take the new remote
to the Goodwill

15:20.828 --> 15:22.253
when you dropped off my old TV?

15:22.480 --> 15:24.738
Uh, maybe, because
you made me stay up all night

15:24.816 --> 15:26.073
rebuilding your stupid TV stand,

15:26.167 --> 15:27.574
and I only got
two hours of sleep.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.986
So we have to watch
the Super Bowl with no sound?

15:30.155 --> 15:31.763
This is why I hate charity.

15:32.748 --> 15:34.340
You know, when I
got my TV stand,

15:34.492 --> 15:35.600
I just paid a guy 75 bucks...

15:35.827 --> 15:37.176
-Thank you.
-Shut it.

15:37.328 --> 15:39.495
We can just use the volume
buttons on the side of the TV.

15:39.588 --> 15:42.923
There are no buttons,
it's too awesome and expensive.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.001
It's fine, everybody,
I'll do my play-by-play.

15:45.094 --> 15:48.337
Kat fumbles the party,
the crowd boos.

15:48.506 --> 15:50.856
Me? Max is the one
who gave away the remote

15:51.009 --> 15:53.676
to the giant TV
he just had to have.

15:53.769 --> 15:54.768
We don't have time for this.

15:54.788 --> 15:55.936
There was just a commercial

15:56.030 --> 15:57.346
with a monkey
riding a motorcycle,

15:57.440 --> 15:59.123
and I don't know
what I'm supposed to buy!

15:59.292 --> 16:00.607
You've got to
go back to the Goodwill

16:00.627 --> 16:01.867
and get the remote.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.295
Fine, but we wouldn't
even be in this mess

16:04.522 --> 16:05.871
if you'd have let me
have a bathroom TV.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.049
God, my feet are hot.

16:10.878 --> 16:12.211
Uh...

16:12.363 --> 16:14.380
Good news, everybody.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.290
I'm gonna move up
the halftime show.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.976
Cat-y Perry, you're on.

16:18.203 --> 16:19.126
You jump to the couch.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.979
You jump
to the couch.

16:21.130 --> 16:22.205
It's not working.

16:22.223 --> 16:24.107
Thanks, Kelly. Big help.

16:27.729 --> 16:28.736
Hey.

16:29.731 --> 16:30.546
Hey.

16:30.565 --> 16:31.897
Max texted Carter.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.640
Goodwill's still
looking for the remote.

16:33.735 --> 16:35.009
But, on the plus side,

16:35.011 --> 16:36.719
he found a pair
of corduroy bellbottoms

16:36.721 --> 16:40.164
that "are tight in
all the right places."

16:41.835 --> 16:43.459
Are you okay?

16:44.820 --> 16:46.379
It's me and Max.

16:47.065 --> 16:48.339
I don't know.

16:48.416 --> 16:50.249
Maybe moving in
together this soon

16:50.401 --> 16:53.069
-was not the best idea.
-Mmm.

16:53.162 --> 16:54.345
It's an adjustment.

16:54.572 --> 16:57.164
You've lived alone
most of your life.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.833
It's hard to learn to compromise

16:59.927 --> 17:02.520
for the first time
at the age of 45.

17:02.671 --> 17:04.930
Mother, I'm only 40.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.192
You are? Dear Lord.

17:11.105 --> 17:12.679
And I'm compromising.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.848
We bought his
brand of toilet paper.

17:14.868 --> 17:18.778
I haven't walked right in
two days, but I'm trying.

17:18.930 --> 17:20.112
Listen, I know.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.265
Changing your ways can feel like

17:22.358 --> 17:24.375
you're giving away
a little bit of yourself,

17:24.527 --> 17:25.543
but remember,

17:25.770 --> 17:28.713
you're getting something
wonderful in return.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.007
Max.

17:31.867 --> 17:33.051
Yeah.

17:34.220 --> 17:34.886
Max.

17:35.113 --> 17:36.946
Max, who has a 45-minute

17:36.964 --> 17:38.222
daily skin-care routine.

17:38.449 --> 17:40.116
I literally heard him say,

17:40.134 --> 17:43.144
"I just want to look better
than Paul Rudd."

17:44.230 --> 17:46.622
Look, in a lot of ways,

17:46.641 --> 17:49.475
men are impossible,
so you have two options:

17:49.627 --> 17:51.143
Learn to live with them,

17:51.296 --> 17:53.796
or wear that exact outfit
to a lesbian bar

17:53.815 --> 17:56.032
and get on with your life.

17:59.137 --> 18:00.970
Yeah, I'm parked
right out front.

18:01.063 --> 18:02.729
License plate "HURRYUP."

18:02.807 --> 18:04.582
(laughs) Just a coincidence.

18:04.733 --> 18:06.459
Yeah, see you soon.

18:07.979 --> 18:08.661
(knock on window)

18:08.813 --> 18:10.404
Wrong car, wrong night!

18:10.498 --> 18:12.072
Carter?

18:12.092 --> 18:13.332
What are you doing here?

18:13.409 --> 18:15.927
I had to pick up
a universal TV remote.

18:16.078 --> 18:19.263
Long story short, white friends.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.507
-Hey, are you Randi?
-Yes.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.416
Who the hell are you?

18:22.435 --> 18:23.584
Joel. Am I in the right car?

18:23.603 --> 18:24.844
-No.
-Yes.

18:24.996 --> 18:25.845
Should I get out?

18:25.997 --> 18:26.771
-Yes.
-No.

18:26.998 --> 18:28.331
BOTH:
Okay, what's going on?

18:29.183 --> 18:31.834
I started driving Uber
to make a little extra money.

18:31.927 --> 18:32.668
What?

18:32.761 --> 18:33.869
I have a flight to catch

18:33.871 --> 18:35.696
in an hour, so could we maybe...

18:36.765 --> 18:38.190
Ooh, bottled water.

18:39.010 --> 18:42.011
My half of the mortgage
was more than I thought.

18:42.104 --> 18:43.121
Like a lot more.

18:43.272 --> 18:44.363
Like, if you can afford that,

18:44.515 --> 18:46.273
why the hell was
my Valentine's gift

18:46.292 --> 18:47.566
a coupon to
unload the dishwasher?

18:47.627 --> 18:50.611
It was a series of coupons,
including a free hug

18:50.688 --> 18:51.704
and a free back rub.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.189
And they were all
for the same reason.

18:53.207 --> 18:54.523
I was hoping they
would lead to sex.

18:54.542 --> 18:55.967
I really do need to
get to the airport.

18:56.194 --> 18:58.194
Joel, you're a man traveling
on Super Bowl Sunday.

18:58.196 --> 18:59.971
Your needs mean nothing to me.

19:00.865 --> 19:03.141
Didn't I tell you I would cover
your part of the mortgage?

19:03.292 --> 19:05.201
No, no, I can
pay my fair share.

19:05.294 --> 19:06.811
I've never had to
rely on anybody,

19:07.038 --> 19:08.295
and I'm not about to start now.

19:08.389 --> 19:09.963
Baby, we about to be married.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.465
We're a team.

19:11.634 --> 19:13.042
Like Jay and Beyoncé.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.801
Barack and Michelle.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.136
Oprah and Gayle.

19:16.305 --> 19:18.764
You know, my mother and I
were in a similar situation.

19:18.916 --> 19:21.884
We agreed to pay our rent on a
sliding scale based on income.

19:21.903 --> 19:23.494
Damn it, would
you mind your own...

19:24.555 --> 19:27.314
Actually, Boy Kat
back here has a good idea.

19:27.408 --> 19:29.408
What do you think, baby?

19:30.336 --> 19:32.578
I just don't want you to
think I'm taking advantage.

19:32.730 --> 19:35.840
I don't. I think it's fair.

19:36.067 --> 19:39.051
Okay, then I'm in.

19:40.254 --> 19:42.180
You guys make
an adorable couple.

19:42.331 --> 19:43.923
Can I take a picture of you

19:44.075 --> 19:45.408
and tell my mom
that we're dating?

19:45.501 --> 19:46.242
Excuse me?

19:46.260 --> 19:48.394
And ride cancelled.

19:54.101 --> 19:55.359
(whistle blows on TV)

19:55.511 --> 19:57.010
All right, that's the end
of the third quarter,

19:57.030 --> 19:59.271
and Sheila won again?

19:59.424 --> 20:00.347
(laughs)

20:00.366 --> 20:03.016
I've got racks
on racks on racks.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.119
I hate that I taught you that.

20:10.101 --> 20:12.526
Everyone's having a good time
at your party.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.545
Our party.

20:15.606 --> 20:17.773
I think it's 'cause
they love your TV.

20:17.942 --> 20:19.592
Our TV.

20:20.536 --> 20:22.703
No, it's my TV. (laughs)

20:22.797 --> 20:25.130
But I should've talked
to you before I bought it.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.132
Yeah, you should've.

20:27.285 --> 20:29.802
But I got to be more flexible.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.729
BOTH:
That's what she said.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.290
And I've got to compromise.

20:34.308 --> 20:37.142
And I have definitely got to
go back to my old toilet paper.

20:37.295 --> 20:39.570
I've been to hell and back
with your one-ply.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.389
Listen, we're figuring it out.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.800
The good news is I think
I've finally gotten the hang

20:44.819 --> 20:46.652
of how you organize the fridge.

20:46.729 --> 20:47.803
(chuckling):
Oh.

20:47.896 --> 20:49.080
Not even close.

20:49.307 --> 20:51.398
Cheese and lettuce
in the same drawer?

20:51.492 --> 20:53.459
I had to sit down.

20:55.980 --> 20:58.381
Ow! One-ply!
