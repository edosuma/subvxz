00:08.200 --> 00:09.600
Welcome back, Seattle.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.600
Thank you for joining us
in celebrating this,

00:11.900 --> 00:14.200
our 2000th show.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.200
- Hard to believe, isn't it, Roz?
- No, that feels just about right.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.800
Ah, yes, well,
what a festive day this is.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.500
No stop has been unpulled.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.400
I would like to take this opportunity

00:25.600 --> 00:27.900
to acknowledge
the anniversary luncheon spread

00:28.200 --> 00:31.300
provided by our friends
at Señor José Phong,

00:31.700 --> 00:33.600
home of the sweet and sour taco.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.400
And don't forget, a little later,

00:35.700 --> 00:40.000
we'll have Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates live in studio

00:40.300 --> 00:42.700
to congratulate me on
my 2000th show.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.900
Apparently, I hear through
the grapevine,

00:45.100 --> 00:47.300
he is a big fan.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.800
[LAUGHS]

00:49.000 --> 00:50.400
Roz, what do we have next?

00:50.600 --> 00:52.200
It's time for another blooper.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.800
Oh, well, I believe we're up
to number four

00:56.100 --> 00:59.300
as voted by you, the listeners.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.900
Here's what happened
when a certain producer

01:03.200 --> 01:07.400
didn't realise her microphone
was on during the show.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
[LAUGHS]

01:09.100 --> 01:10.900
ROZ [ON RADIO]:

01:22.700 --> 01:24.400
I can't believe
that wasn't voted number one.

01:24.700 --> 01:28.100
Oh, ha, ladies and gentlemen,
it's our station manager,

01:28.500 --> 01:31.400
KACL's own Kenny Daly. Ha, ha.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.500
Listen, doc, I got a special someone
out there who'd like to say hello.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.100
By all means,
let's bring him in, Kenny.

01:37.300 --> 01:40.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
our special guest has finally arrived.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
Please welcome...

01:42.400 --> 01:43.500
[BARKS]

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
[AIRHORN BLOWS]

01:45.000 --> 01:47.500
- Bulldog?
- Great to see you, doc. Hey, Roz.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.400
FRASIER:
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

01:49.600 --> 01:52.300
it's our old friend and former colleague,
Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.800
Thanks for coming
to celebrate my 2000th show.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.800
Yeah, yeah, congrats.
Didn't think you'd last two weeks.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Listen up, sports fans, Bulldog here.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.800
I know what you're all thinking:
Bulldog's been gone too long.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.300
How can you get me back on the air?
Okay, listen up.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.199
You send your cards and letters
of support to Kenny Daly, KACL...

02:08.500 --> 02:11.200
Hold on, hold on, Bulldog!
Our special guest has arrived.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.900
- P.O. Box 451, Seattle...
- Bulldog!

02:13.200 --> 02:15.600
Would you and your noisemaker
please wait in Roz's booth?

02:15.900 --> 02:17.800
- This is an air horn, doc.
- Yes, I was referring

02:18.100 --> 02:20.500
to that flapping hole above your chin.
Now get out!

02:23.100 --> 02:24.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's please welcome

02:25.000 --> 02:26.500
Microsoft Chairman, Bill Gates.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.200
Ha, ha. Good to see you, sir.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.100
- Sorry I was late.
- Oh, that's all right.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.200
- I was just talking to an old friend.
- Yes, ha, ha.

02:37.400 --> 02:40.300
Well, I've... I've got
so many questions to ask you.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.100
Uh, why don't we just dive right in?

02:43.400 --> 02:44.900
I've been wondering,

02:45.100 --> 02:48.600
when did you first
become a fan of my show?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.800
Excuse me.
Warren from Kirkland is on Line 2.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.500
Ye... Yes, Roz. I won't be taking
any calls until after Mr. Gates has left.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.100
- Actually, it's for Mr. Gates.
FRASIER: Well, um...

02:59.900 --> 03:02.200
Go ahead, caller.
You're on with Mister Bill Gates.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.300
WARREN [ON PHONE]:
<i>Yeah, hi, Mr. Gates.</i>

03:04.600 --> 03:06.200
<i>I bought your new</i>
<i>Windows XP programme,</i>

03:06.500 --> 03:08.800
<i>and I'm about to instal it,</i>
<i>but it's an upgrade.</i>

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
- <i>Do I need to make a boot disc?</i>
- That's a very good question.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.200
You don't need to make a boot disk.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.200
You just put the CD in,
and it'll upgrade.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.800
I hope that answers your question.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.000
That's a feature of XP,
very quick, very smooth.

03:21.300 --> 03:22.800
- Hey, this is fun.
FRASIER: Ah.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.300
Thank you for calling, Warren.

03:26.600 --> 03:27.700
Now, where were we?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.900
Can Mr. Gates take a few more calls?
The board is lighting up. Wow.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.600
Who knew we had a Line 7?

03:34.900 --> 03:36.800
Uh, Roz, I believe Mr. Gates
is probably anxious

03:37.000 --> 03:40.100
- to get on with the interview.
- No, no, I'm... I'm happy to.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.500
Very well.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.200
Go ahead, caller.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.000
WOMAN CALLER [ON PHONE]:
<i>Wow, Bill Gates. This is so cool.</i>

03:49.300 --> 03:50.300
Thank you.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.300
WOMAN CALLER [ON PHONE]:
<i>Hey, I have a question</i>

03:52.600 --> 03:55.300
<i>about Multilingual User Interface</i>
<i>add-ons. What are those?</i>

03:55.500 --> 03:57.300
BILL:
Well, the Multilingual add-ons

03:57.600 --> 04:01.000
let you run Windows in different
languages. You can use it in German...

04:01.400 --> 04:03.800
Do you believe this
egomaniacal gasbag?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.500
He's taking over my show.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.700
Don't you think
you're exaggerating just a bit?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.600
Who do we have next, Roz?

04:09.900 --> 04:12.500
We have Bob from Fremont.
He has a question about his laptop.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.100
Go ahead, Bob.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.200
I'm listening.

[SIGHS]

04:33.100 --> 04:34.500
[CHUCKLES]

04:34.700 --> 04:38.700
Two thousand shows, ha-ha-ha.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.800
NILES: Hurry up, Frasier,
we're gonna miss the reservation.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.400
Yeah, I'll be right there.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.900
[HUMMING]

05:21.900 --> 05:24.200
[GASPS]

05:24.600 --> 05:26.900
Two thousand shows.
That's quite a milestone.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.900
It is. Can anyone tell me
what happened today?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.200
I forgot to listen.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.100
I just listened for five minutes

05:32.300 --> 05:34.900
in case he asked me
what my favourite part was.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.600
I just say the call from Tacoma.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.100
There's bound to be
a call from Tacoma.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
Excuse me.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.800
Could I see all of you
in my room for just a jiff?

05:45.100 --> 05:48.900
- Come on, I'm hungry.
- I know. I am too.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.800
FRASIER:
Okay, are we all here?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.200
- Good.
- What's wrong?

05:53.400 --> 05:56.600
Something is amiss.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.200
I'll say. I always thought
that was a sweater cubby.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.200
Well, it's not.
This is a collection of all my shows.

06:10.300 --> 06:14.100
I was just examining my collection
when I realised that someone...

06:15.800 --> 06:19.100
...had placed one of my tapes...

06:20.000 --> 06:21.400
...upside down.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.100
[MARTIN GASPS]

06:23.300 --> 06:26.600
What kind of sick, twisted...?

06:27.300 --> 06:29.100
Well, turn it right-side up
and let's go eat.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.900
- You probably did it yourself.
- All right, conceivably.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.200
But I guarantee you, I would never
have removed my tape from the case

06:36.500 --> 06:41.700
and replaced it with
<i>The Best of Hall and Oates.</i>

06:43.200 --> 06:44.500
All right, I won't be mad.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.700
Just tell me who did this.

06:50.700 --> 06:51.800
Nobody did this?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.800
Tell you what. I did it.
Now, can we go eat?

06:55.100 --> 06:56.600
FRASIER:
Not so fast, Dad.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.300
Okay.

06:58.500 --> 07:02.600
- Let's examine the evidence.
ALL: Oh, no.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.700
A Hall and Oates tape.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.900
That rules you out, Dad.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.700
And it definitely rules out Niles.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.700
- Dr. Crane...
- Or does it?

07:17.900 --> 07:19.500
Perhaps the tape
was just a red herring,

07:19.800 --> 07:21.700
meant to throw me off the scent.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.500
A psychological game.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.500
There's only one of you
that would combat me on that level.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.100
- I did it!
- Ah-ha!

07:29.300 --> 07:32.300
You can't say, "ah-ha."
You thought it was me.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.500
- Why'd you do it, Daphne?
- I didn't mean to.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.200
I was trying to listen to a tape in that
boom box you gave me for Christmas,

07:39.600 --> 07:41.200
only I wasn't getting any sound,

07:41.300 --> 07:43.500
and I didn't know if it were the tape
or the boom box,

07:43.800 --> 07:45.300
and I didn't have any other tapes,

07:45.500 --> 07:48.000
so I grabbed one of your tapes
just to test the boom box out.

07:48.300 --> 07:51.100
And it turns out
it was the boom box after all.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.600
Only then,
I couldn't get it out of the boom box,

07:53.800 --> 07:58.400
so I used a screwdriver to pry it out,
and I broke the tape. I'm so sorry.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.600
- Oh, there, there, Daphne...
- Stand down, Niles.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.700
Daphne.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.800
Do you realise what you've done?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.200
This isn't like any normal tape

08:14.400 --> 08:20.100
that you can just go down to
your local music shop and purchase.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.500
It's unique and irreplaceable.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.000
Can't you just get the station
to make you a copy?

08:27.300 --> 08:31.200
Unless I get the station
to make me another copy,

08:31.600 --> 08:33.600
which, or course, I can.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.299
The only transgression here

08:36.600 --> 08:39.600
is that Daphne didn't come to me
with the truth.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.500
Oh, I'm so sorry, Dr. Crane.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.000
I will never lie to you again.

08:45.300 --> 08:48.200
Well, then, if that's
what you learned, it was all worth it.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.200
So, what are we all sitting here for?

08:50.500 --> 08:53.200
I believe we have
a 2000th show to celebrate.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.200
NILES: Here, here.
- So, did you all listen?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.000
NILES: Oh, did we.
MARTIN: It was great.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.400
DAPHNE: I especially liked
that call from Tacoma.

08:59.700 --> 09:01.700
Oh, which one?

09:03.900 --> 09:04.900
You know, in nine years,

09:05.200 --> 09:07.200
this is the first time
I've been down to the archives.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.100
- Oh, my God. I remember this place.
- Really?

09:10.400 --> 09:13.600
I came down here once
after a Christmas party.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.900
Whatever for?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.200
Well, I had
a little too much champagne,

09:18.600 --> 09:22.300
and you know how you get
a little lonely around the holiday?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.700
Brings back memories, huh, Roz?

09:25.300 --> 09:27.300
- Bulldog!
- That was some Christmas, huh?

09:27.700 --> 09:29.700
When Santa left
a bit of Bulldog in your stockings.

09:29.900 --> 09:31.300
[LAUGHS]

09:31.600 --> 09:33.100
You're disgusting.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.100
What, I went too far? I'm sorry.
Why don't, uh, you come back here?

09:36.300 --> 09:38.000
I'll slip you an apology.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.800
Bulldog's still got it!

09:41.300 --> 09:42.900
Bulldog, what the hell
are you doing here?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.100
Oh, this is, uh, this is my new job.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.200
I, uh, catalogue the archive.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.800
You know, I clean up a bit,

09:49.100 --> 09:51.500
but, uh, I figure
I'll be back on the air in no time,

09:51.800 --> 09:54.800
as long as I attack this job
with my trademark "can-do" attitude.

09:55.200 --> 09:59.300
Great. Well, then, we're looking for
a copy of my show, episode 893.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.400
- No can do.
- What?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.800
What, I only been here an hour.
I don't even know where the john is.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.700
Where...?

10:06.900 --> 10:08.700
Where's my PowerBar?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.300
I had a PowerBar here.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.000
Someone stole my PowerBar!
This stinks!

10:14.400 --> 10:17.900
This is total B. S!
This is... Oh, here it is.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.900
Frasier, here's a box marked
"Best of Crane."

10:23.200 --> 10:25.500
Oh, uh, thanks, Roz.
Let's have a look. Ah, good.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.900
What...?

10:29.700 --> 10:31.400
There's just a few tapes in here.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.800
- All right, keep looking.
- Oh, hey, doc.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.500
Kenny, just the man
I was looking for.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.500
Listen, where are all the tapes
of my shows kept?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.300
You got them, right there.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.300
- Well, where are the rest of them?
- Yes.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.900
There are no rest.
We record over them.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.200
I mean, look around, doc,
we got a space problem here.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.800
Hey, Kenny, where do you want me
to put these snow tyres?

10:53.200 --> 10:55.400
Oh, put them
right next to my kids' bikes.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.800
FRASIER:
Good afternoon, Seattle.

11:04.100 --> 11:09.000
Before we go to the phones,
I have a boon to ask of you.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.400
If any of you happens to have
in your possession

11:12.800 --> 11:14.700
a tape of my broadcast

11:14.800 --> 11:19.900
from June 14, 1996,

11:20.800 --> 11:23.100
I am in need of a copy.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.400
You see, I understand that
from time to time

11:25.600 --> 11:28.100
people who call in to my show
record it,

11:28.300 --> 11:30.500
perhaps in order to...
To review my advice,

11:30.800 --> 11:33.200
or even just play it for some friends.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.100
Now, I realise that
this is a bit of a long shot,

11:37.300 --> 11:41.300
but it is the only missing tape
of my collection,

11:41.700 --> 11:45.600
and therefore, of course,
has great sentimental value.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.600
Thanks for your consideration.
Now, Roz, who's our first caller?

11:48.800 --> 11:51.900
We have Joe from Vashon Island
on Line 1.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.800
Go ahead, Joe, I'm listening.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.700
JOE [ON PHONE]:
<i>About that missing tape.</i>

11:56.900 --> 11:58.200
- Yes, yes?
JOE [ON PHONE]: <i>Yeah,</i>

11:58.400 --> 11:59.600
<i>I know what you're going through.</i>

11:59.900 --> 12:02.700
<i>A couple years ago, I was in</i>
<i>a taxicab and lost a gold cufflink.</i>

12:03.000 --> 12:05.400
Yes, and this relates
to my missing tape how?

12:05.700 --> 12:08.300
JOE [ON PHONE]:
<i>Well, it's missing, and I'm bummed.</i>

12:08.700 --> 12:10.900
<i>It has the initials J.S. On it.</i>

12:11.200 --> 12:13.500
<i>If anyone finds it,</i>
<i>I'd love to have it back.</i>

12:13.800 --> 12:17.100
Yes, um, I'm sure you would,
but unless it's about my missing tape,

12:17.400 --> 12:19.000
well, then I would prefer
to stick to calls

12:19.300 --> 12:23.500
about mental and emotional issues,
as usual.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.200
Thank you for your call.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.900
Who's our next caller, Roz?

12:28.100 --> 12:29.600
We have Phyllis from Green Lake.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.000
Phyllis, go ahead, I'm listening.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.400
PHYLLIS [ON PHONE]:
<i>My cat ran away last Wednesday.</i>

12:34.700 --> 12:37.900
<i>She's orange with a white chest and</i>
<i>one white paw. Her name is</i>...

12:38.300 --> 12:39.300
Wait, wait, Phyllis...

12:39.500 --> 12:40.700
PHYLLIS [ON PHONE]:
<i>So if anyone</i>...

12:41.000 --> 12:42.600
All right, hold on, hold on a minute.

12:42.900 --> 12:44.700
All right, now listen to me, people,

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
I don't want to turn this show into
the lost and found bin of the airwaves.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.000
Phyllis, I'm gonna let you
finish your description,

12:52.300 --> 12:54.500
and then we're going back
to our regular show. All right?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.600
PHYLLIS [ON PHONE]:
<i>Okay. She has green eyes,</i>

12:56.900 --> 13:00.000
<i>a rhinestone collar,</i>
<i>and when she's happy...</i>

13:00.300 --> 13:02.400
Let's recap.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.100
Uh, in the last three hours,

13:05.600 --> 13:09.100
we have located
a missing engagement ring,

13:09.500 --> 13:11.700
one lost cufflink,

13:12.000 --> 13:13.700
two missing cats,

13:14.000 --> 13:18.600
and we've actually reunited Eric from
Belltown with his biological parents.

13:21.100 --> 13:25.500
Still, sadly,
no sign of my missing tape.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.200
To that end, listeners,

13:27.300 --> 13:32.300
please scour your attics, basements,
hope chests, whatever.

13:32.700 --> 13:34.200
Meantime, this is Dr. Frasier Crane,

13:34.500 --> 13:36.900
wishing you good day
and good mental health.

13:37.100 --> 13:41.400
And don't forget
to look behind things.

13:44.200 --> 13:47.000
- I'm sorry, Frasier.
- Oh...

13:47.300 --> 13:49.100
That's all right, Roz.
I mean, it'll turn up.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
I mean, it's only the first day.
Word will get around.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.100
I'm... I'm sure somebody
has that tape.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.700
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up too high.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.400
Chances are
that tape is gone for good.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.100
Well, if that's the case, then so be it.

Hello, Dr. Crane.

14:29.900 --> 14:31.900
How was your nap?

14:34.700 --> 14:36.400
It was lovely.

14:38.700 --> 14:41.300
Daphne, could you make me
a cup of tea, please,

14:41.600 --> 14:45.500
and whatever meal would be
appropriate to this time of day?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.900
Dr. Crane,
you've been in bed all weekend.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.800
How about going for a nice walk?

14:54.100 --> 14:56.000
No, thanks.

14:57.100 --> 14:58.800
Well, how about
going to a movie then?

14:59.100 --> 15:00.700
Take your mind off your troubles.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.200
My car's in the shop.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.800
You could take public transportation.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Oh, look, it's your brother Niles,
here for a visit.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.300
Hello, Frasier, how are we today?

15:26.500 --> 15:28.400
What the hell is wrong
with the two of you?

15:28.700 --> 15:30.700
You'd think I'd been found
walking through the park

15:31.000 --> 15:32.800
in my underwear, talking to pigeons.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.400
- Would we like a walk in the park?
- Oh, good God.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.600
All right, all right.
Frasier, Frasier, wait.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.800
Hey, looking good, buddy.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.400
- Not any better, huh?
- No, and I feel just awful.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.400
- This is all my fault.
- Oh, come on.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.700
I'm the one who ruined
his treasured collection.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.200
Oh, all his crap is treasured.

15:56.100 --> 15:59.500
But look, don't feel bad.
I've broken lots of his stuff.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.000
I've never heard of you
breaking anything.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.100
Well, that's because I know
how to cover my tracks.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.800
Take a look at that fertility god statue
over there.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.000
It used to be a lot more fertile,
if you know what I mean.

16:16.500 --> 16:20.300
Oh, my God! This is a Tootsie Roll!

16:23.500 --> 16:25.400
- That's brilliant!
- Oh, that's nothing.

Two years ago Eddie and I
were horsing around.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.600
I knocked it over. It took me hours
to glue it back together again.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.600
Why, you can't even tell.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.000
I had no idea you were so devious.

Listen, Niles, I appreciate
your concern, I really do, but, frankly,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.500
I am in no mood to endure therapy
with my younger brother,

16:49.900 --> 16:52.400
- no matter how well-intentioned.
- I'm not trying to butt in,

16:52.700 --> 16:56.700
I'm just curious as to
why this tape matters so much to you.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.400
Do you ever listen to these?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.300
Once.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.099
When I had a date over.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.500
It proved a useful mood-setter.

17:10.099 --> 17:11.700
Okay.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.500
Well, tell me this, then.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.099
Do you ever intend to listen
to any of the others?

17:17.900 --> 17:18.900
I don't know.

17:19.200 --> 17:23.200
So why is it so important to you
to have each and every one of them?

17:23.599 --> 17:26.599
Because it's a collection, Niles.
That's what a collection is.

17:26.800 --> 17:31.000
Is it possible that a harmless collection
has become an unhealthy obsession?

17:31.600 --> 17:34.800
- It's... It's just a hobby, all right?
- Or an obsession.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.100
- Yeah, an eccentricity.
- Or an obsession.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.300
It, you know, it's a quirk.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.500
That's it. I'm quirky.
I'm delightfully quirky.

has brought your life to a standstill?

that eventually I started taping them

of work early

so I could make sure
to be home in time.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.400
So, in a way, Tom,

22:12.600 --> 22:16.200
you could say that your obsession
with your collection

22:16.500 --> 22:18.900
was bringing your life to a standstill.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.700

how ridiculous I was being.

to... To tape the show.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.500
Oh, good for you, Tom.

to have a passion for collecting

without losing sight of your priorities.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.500
Yes, exactly. And...
And that's why I quit my job.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.700
Oh, this turned out really nice.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.400
And, you know,
eventually the money ran out,

22:44.700 --> 22:47.000
so I got a gig as a night doorman.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.000
And that way I could, uh...

22:49.300 --> 22:51.000
Oh. I could, you know, uh,
listen to the show

22:51.300 --> 22:53.500
a second time on my Walkman,

22:53.700 --> 22:56.200
and then I could do
my transcriptions at work.

22:57.200 --> 23:02.600
- You transcribe the show?
- Well, you gotta have a backup.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.500
Uh, listen, Tom, you know,
I must confess,

23:06.800 --> 23:09.300
I'm a... I'm a bit concerned. Um.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.700
I'm delighted to have you as a fan.
I really am,

23:14.000 --> 23:17.900
but the whole purpose of my show
is to help people

23:18.200 --> 23:20.700
live better lives,

23:21.000 --> 23:23.200
and I'm afraid that I've hurt yours.

23:23.900 --> 23:25.100
I just...

23:25.400 --> 23:29.000
There should be more to...
To life than...

23:30.200 --> 23:31.400
There should be more.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.700
Yes, but as you always say,

23:33.900 --> 23:38.000
life is most fulfilling when
spent in the pursuit of one's passions.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.300
Yes, but as I've also said,

23:40.600 --> 23:46.200
weave the tapestry of your life
with many diverse threads.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.500
Ah, yes, but you added,

23:48.700 --> 23:53.700
make sure to weave the pattern
that pleases you most.

23:55.700 --> 23:58.900
Weave the tapestry
with diverse threads?

23:59.300 --> 24:03.500
Yes. Frasier said all of these things,
and many others.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.000
He is a genius.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.700
Would you like some guacamole?

24:09.500 --> 24:11.800
- Uh, yeah, sure. Uh.
- Thank you.

24:12.400 --> 24:16.100
Thanks, Tom. Listen, I'm...
I'm just, uh, thinking. Um.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.200
I don't really want
to talk you into anything.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.700
It seems I've done enough
of that already. I, uh...

24:23.400 --> 24:25.200
Thank you.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.900
Tom, what I'm getting at here is,

24:29.200 --> 24:32.400
I think there could be
more to your life

24:32.700 --> 24:37.600
than just my tapes and pictures.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
Now, if you'd be interested in
exploring those issues further,

24:42.200 --> 24:45.400
I can recommend someone
who would be glad to talk with you.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.100
[MOUTHING] <i>Not me. Not me.</i>
- Why? I have you.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.000
Thank you.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.200
Well, you know, l...
I think it's time we got going.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.900
Oh, no, so soon?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.600
Oh, well, I suppose
someone like you

25:03.700 --> 25:05.400
probably has a lot of things
they gotta do.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.300
- Right.
- I'm glad you could come at all.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.400
Please, you know,
stop by any time you want.

25:10.700 --> 25:13.000
Thank you, Tom,
and it was a pleasure.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.800
Oh, don't forget your tape.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.100
You know, Tom,

25:20.400 --> 25:21.700
I'd like you to keep that.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
But this is the reason you came.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.900
If I ever need it,

25:27.200 --> 25:28.600
I'll know where to find it.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.900
Um...

25:36.200 --> 25:39.100
You know those shows
where I sat in for Frasier?

25:41.400 --> 25:43.900
You wouldn't happen to
have those tapes, would you?

25:44.200 --> 25:47.000
Sorry, l... I don't collect just anything.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.000
Hey, there he is.
Did you get your tape back?

25:57.300 --> 25:58.700
Actually, no, I didn't.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.500
What happened?

26:01.000 --> 26:02.800
Daphne...

26:03.900 --> 26:06.100
...tonight I saw an example

26:06.900 --> 26:10.400
of how an obsession
can take over a man's life.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.200
I don't want to be that man.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.100
Therefore, I chose to leave it
and render my collection imperfect.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.600
But that's all right. You see,

26:23.300 --> 26:25.900
I don't need things to be perfect.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.100
Hello.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.700
Something's amiss.

26:36.900 --> 26:37.900
[GASPS]

26:38.100 --> 26:40.900
My double-handled amphora!

26:41.200 --> 26:43.600
All right, no one leaves!
