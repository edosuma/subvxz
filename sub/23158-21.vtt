WEBVTT

00:00.106 --> 00:03.041
Take 'em off, giris.
Take them totally off.

00:07.846 --> 00:08.905
What murder?

00:08.982 --> 00:11.610
The other partner.
He was murdered last night.

00:11.784 --> 00:14.150
I don't believe you
killed them. Honest.

00:14.454 --> 00:16.114
And I'm afraid I'm next.

00:16.189 --> 00:18.282
Not only does she find
one guy to pay her rent,

00:18.358 --> 00:19.484
she finds two.

00:19.559 --> 00:21.891
I can't stand pain
and violence. I hate it.

00:21.961 --> 00:23.622
I love it.
No, wait!

00:26.332 --> 00:28.027
Jan? You all right?

01:45.228 --> 01:48.686
<i>For Lani it's a simple</i>
<i>cover-up of jade green</i>

01:49.532 --> 01:52.023
<i>with a touch of hibiscus</i>
<i>in her hair.</i>

01:52.502 --> 01:55.062
And more than
a touch of sexiness

01:55.138 --> 01:57.265
in this daringly
cut two-piece.

01:59.108 --> 02:01.838
<i>A beautiful swimsuit</i>
<i>for a beautiful lady.</i>

02:13.656 --> 02:15.123
<i>Orchids for Wendy.</i>

02:15.191 --> 02:17.318
<i>Now, Wendy's</i>
<i>an old-fashioned girl.</i>

02:17.393 --> 02:20.226
<i>New-fangled swimsuits may be</i>
<i>all right for some, but...</i>

02:20.296 --> 02:22.730
But Wendy, Wendy
sticks to tradition.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.600
The traditional bikini.

02:25.868 --> 02:27.233
Another touch of the Islands

02:27.770 --> 02:29.169
<i>from Jan Kona.</i>

02:49.459 --> 02:51.518
<i>And here are all</i>
<i>of our lovely giris,</i>

02:51.594 --> 02:53.425
<i>back to give you</i>
<i>one more glimpse</i>

02:53.496 --> 02:55.760
<i>of the new summer swimwear</i>
<i>by Jan Kona.</i>

02:55.832 --> 02:58.801
<i>Aren't they beautiful,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen?</i>

03:21.057 --> 03:22.820
<i>Thank you,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

03:22.892 --> 03:25.793
<i>And that concludes</i>
<i>our special sneak preview</i>

03:25.862 --> 03:28.023
of Jan Kona
beachwear designs.

03:28.197 --> 03:30.961
And now, may I present your
co-host for this afternoon,

03:31.734 --> 03:32.928
Bart Lindsey.

03:47.283 --> 03:50.480
No, no, no, please. Thank you.
L... I do appreciate it.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.588
I loved it
as much as you did.

03:52.655 --> 03:55.954
But save your applause
for the one who deserves it.

03:56.259 --> 03:59.023
My inspired, talented,

03:59.095 --> 04:02.622
hard-working,
beautiful partner, Jan Kona!

04:15.845 --> 04:18.642
Thank you, Bart.
And thank you.

04:18.714 --> 04:21.808
I'm so glad you liked
all of our new designs.

04:21.884 --> 04:24.216
Alan predicts
a great year for us.

04:24.287 --> 04:25.948
By the way,
where is Alan?

04:26.022 --> 04:27.512
You mean Mr. Shy?

04:28.691 --> 04:32.218
This is only two-thirds of the
Jan Kona company, everybody.

04:32.295 --> 04:33.694
Our important third

04:33.763 --> 04:35.856
is the genius
that put this show together

04:35.932 --> 04:37.957
and narrated
so beautifully.

04:38.034 --> 04:40.935
Come on out, Alan Russell.
Don't be bashful.

04:44.841 --> 04:47.366
Come on, Alan.
Everybody loves you.

04:51.781 --> 04:53.248
Okay, now spit.

04:53.583 --> 04:54.914
Spit?
Yeah.

04:56.486 --> 04:57.817
See,
you rub it around

04:57.887 --> 05:00.583
and the saliva keeps your mask
from fogging up.

05:00.723 --> 05:02.816
Rubbed it in real good?
All right.

05:02.892 --> 05:05.224
Okay, rinse it out
a little bit.

05:10.766 --> 05:13.326
Get your snorkel in.
Here we go.

05:23.346 --> 05:25.337
You're doing beautifully.

05:28.351 --> 05:29.613
Magnum!

05:33.589 --> 05:35.386
I'll be right back.

05:41.631 --> 05:43.292
Thanks, Higgins.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.935
I should like to point out
two important facts:

05:47.003 --> 05:48.368
One, I'm neither
your secretary

05:48.437 --> 05:49.461
nor your
answering service.

05:49.539 --> 05:50.528
Higgins.

05:50.606 --> 05:53.166
Two, you have breached
your own code of conduct

05:53.242 --> 05:55.676
by dallying with one of
Robin Masters' house guests.

05:55.745 --> 05:56.939
I am not dallying,

05:57.013 --> 05:58.503
I am teaching her
how to snorkel.

05:58.581 --> 06:00.344
Nonsense. She's
an expert snorkeler.

06:00.416 --> 06:01.542
I know.

06:01.684 --> 06:02.708
You know?

06:02.785 --> 06:04.013
And she knew that I knew

06:04.086 --> 06:05.576
when she asked me
to teach her.

06:05.655 --> 06:07.145
Then why on earth...

06:07.223 --> 06:08.884
Higgins,
if you never play games,

06:08.958 --> 06:10.892
how do you ever have any fun?

06:12.528 --> 06:14.189
Uh, Miss Jones,

06:14.664 --> 06:15.858
Mr. Masters
has arranged

06:15.932 --> 06:17.729
for you to meet his
publisher on Wednesday

06:17.800 --> 06:20.735
so I've taken the liberty of booking
your flight for this evening.

06:21.504 --> 06:23.233
Thank you, Higgins.

06:35.618 --> 06:37.085
Thomas Magnum here.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.947
Oh, thank goodness.
I thought the line went dead.

06:40.022 --> 06:41.853
Oh, uh, there were
technical difficulties.

06:41.924 --> 06:43.687
Who am I speaking to?

06:43.759 --> 06:45.317
Kona. Jan Kona.

06:45.461 --> 06:47.622
<i>What can I do for you,</i>
<i>Miss Kona?</i>

06:47.697 --> 06:50.632
Mr. Magnum,
at this moment I am so scared

06:50.700 --> 06:52.827
that I barely
make any sense.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.793
Alan Russell,
one of my partners,

06:54.937 --> 06:56.199
has been murdered.

06:56.272 --> 06:58.035
Well, have you
called the police?

06:58.107 --> 07:00.098
<i>They're here now.</i>
<i>They're all over the place.</i>

07:00.843 --> 07:03.937
Look, I'd rather not
discuss this over the phone.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.941
Could you meet me someplace?

07:06.015 --> 07:08.848
Well, the bar of
the King Kamehameha Club?

07:08.918 --> 07:10.647
<i>I can be there</i>
<i>in an hour.</i>

07:14.090 --> 07:15.682
Uh, I can be there in two.

07:16.592 --> 07:18.116
I'll be there.

07:19.362 --> 07:20.989
Oh, Jan, darling.

07:21.264 --> 07:23.892
Florence, I tried
to call you at home.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.824
Oh, of all the days

07:25.935 --> 07:28.495
to go to one of my
committee meetings.

07:28.571 --> 07:29.970
Are you all right?

07:30.039 --> 07:32.269
Alan wanted me
to come today.

07:32.642 --> 07:35.805
Oh, why didn't I
cancel that meeting?

07:35.978 --> 07:39.072
Well, he... he just wasn't the type
of husband to insist on anything.

07:39.148 --> 07:41.343
I said, "Maybe some other time."
He said, "Fine."

07:41.417 --> 07:43.442
And I never spoke
to him again.

07:43.753 --> 07:44.981
Oh, Florence!

07:56.299 --> 07:57.823
Kimo, don't forget
to give me

07:57.900 --> 07:59.458
the bar receipts
from yesterday.

07:59.535 --> 08:00.832
Hi, Thomas.
Hi, Rick.

08:00.903 --> 08:03.064
Give him a drink, Kimo.
Right away, Rick.

08:04.407 --> 08:06.204
I'm supposed to meet
Jan Kona here.

08:06.275 --> 08:07.503
Oh, yeah?

08:07.777 --> 08:09.301
What do you mean,
"Oh, yeah?"

08:09.378 --> 08:11.938
Nothin', except
she's one sexy lady, pal.

08:12.048 --> 08:14.380
Thanks, Kimo.
You're welcome, Magnum.

08:14.450 --> 08:15.644
How well
do you know her?

08:15.718 --> 08:16.980
Not as well
as I'd like to.

08:17.053 --> 08:18.452
Her real name
is Janie Coogan.

08:18.521 --> 08:19.681
She used to be a waitress.

08:19.755 --> 08:21.723
Thomas, she used to wear
this little costume.

08:21.791 --> 08:23.349
She wore these
black mesh stockings.

08:23.426 --> 08:25.485
She had legs that went
all the way up to her neck.

08:25.561 --> 08:27.085
It was to die
when you see this dame.

08:27.163 --> 08:28.152
I get the picture.

08:28.230 --> 08:30.027
Well, she was also
real ambitious, see?

08:30.099 --> 08:33.068
She was lookin' for a guy with money
that could do her a lot of good.

08:33.135 --> 08:34.500
And brother,
did she luck out.

08:34.570 --> 08:36.595
Not only does she find
one guy to pay her rent,

08:36.672 --> 08:37.696
she finds two.

08:37.773 --> 08:39.240
Alan Russell
and Bart Lindsey.

08:39.308 --> 08:41.799
Well, I already know about Russell.
It's an old Island family.

08:41.876 --> 08:42.900
Who's Lindsey?

08:42.977 --> 08:44.912
Well, Lindsey's
a promoter from the mainland.

08:44.980 --> 08:47.073
He made a bundle of money
packaging Hawaiian vacations

08:47.149 --> 08:48.980
and brother,
he laid it on her, too.

08:49.051 --> 08:50.780
And I guess he didn't mind
sharin' her

08:50.853 --> 08:54.345
because Russell was pumpin'
money onto little Janie
with the fantastic body, too.

08:54.423 --> 08:56.084
In fact... Hey,
isn't there a...

08:56.158 --> 08:58.422
There's a name for that, uh...
A French name,

08:58.494 --> 09:00.894
a mena...
A menagerary, right?

09:02.365 --> 09:03.855
It's not even close.

09:03.933 --> 09:05.924
Uh, let me ask you
something, Rick.

09:06.001 --> 09:07.525
These guys
set her up in business

09:07.603 --> 09:09.195
and became
her partners, right?

09:09.271 --> 09:10.260
Yeah. So?

09:10.339 --> 09:11.863
Then she became
a famous designer

09:11.941 --> 09:14.307
and gave 'em a good return
on their investment. Right?

09:14.377 --> 09:15.435
So, what's the point?

09:15.511 --> 09:18.503
The point is that just because
she's a nice-looking woman,

09:18.581 --> 09:20.947
it doesn't mean she
couldn't necessarily have had

09:21.016 --> 09:23.143
a business relationship
with these two guys.

09:23.219 --> 09:25.414
Come on, Thomas, give me
a break. We're adults.

09:25.488 --> 09:27.479
We've been around the block
a couple of times.

09:27.556 --> 09:29.080
Okay. Let me
ask you something.

09:29.158 --> 09:30.591
Suppose it's a guy.

09:30.659 --> 09:31.717
And this guy,

09:31.794 --> 09:33.352
as a kid he starts
to run numbers.

09:33.429 --> 09:35.294
Maybe gets to know
the Mob a little bit.

09:35.364 --> 09:36.695
Hey, not so loud.

09:36.766 --> 09:38.028
Well, he grows up.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.295
Serves in Nam in the Marines,
and musters out in Hawaii.

09:40.369 --> 09:43.065
And eventually,
he becomes the manager

09:43.139 --> 09:45.607
of a fancy private club,
like this.

09:45.674 --> 09:47.733
Are you going to tell me
this guy's a hood?

09:47.810 --> 09:49.835
I'm legitimate,
remember?

09:49.912 --> 09:51.607
There's a moral
in there somewhere,

09:51.680 --> 09:53.272
if you care to hunt for it.

09:56.886 --> 09:58.444
Here she comes.

10:00.222 --> 10:01.246
Hello, Jan.
How are you?

10:01.323 --> 10:02.312
Hi, Rick.

10:02.391 --> 10:03.756
I'm here to meet
a Mr. Magnum.

10:03.826 --> 10:05.054
Well, he's right here.

10:05.127 --> 10:06.253
Jan Kona,
Thomas Magnum.

10:06.328 --> 10:07.386
How do you do?

10:07.463 --> 10:09.431
I have to find you two
a perfect table.

10:09.498 --> 10:10.522
Oh, no, please.

10:10.599 --> 10:12.260
I didn't realize
it would be so busy,

10:12.668 --> 10:15.000
and I've lost
my appetite today, anyway.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.901
Well, we could talk
on the beach.

10:16.972 --> 10:18.098
I'd like that.

10:18.174 --> 10:19.163
Fine.

10:19.241 --> 10:21.175
Uh, why don't you buy
yourself a drink, Rick,

10:21.243 --> 10:23.370
and put it all on my tab?

10:23.446 --> 10:24.845
Put it on his tab.

10:24.914 --> 10:26.313
Another one for the books.

10:28.317 --> 10:31.286
<i>When two people take a walk</i>
<i>on the beach in paradise,</i>

10:31.353 --> 10:32.718
<i>fear and death ought to be</i>

10:32.788 --> 10:34.551
<i>the furthest things</i>
<i>from their minds.</i>

10:34.623 --> 10:37.456
<i>Unfortunately that isn't</i>
<i>always the case.</i>

10:37.526 --> 10:38.993
And then a car
followed me.

10:39.061 --> 10:41.393
I went miles out of my way
before I lost it.

10:41.464 --> 10:43.261
That's why
I was a little late.

10:43.332 --> 10:45.129
Are you sure
you were followed?

10:45.201 --> 10:47.795
I'm neither neurotic
nor hysterical.

10:47.870 --> 10:50.395
And my imagination stops
at the drawing board.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.371
Okay. If somebody
wanted to kill you,

10:53.442 --> 10:55.239
why didn't you
tell the police?

10:55.311 --> 10:58.439
Because I know they're wrong
about Alan's death.

10:58.814 --> 11:00.941
They think
robbery was the motive.

11:01.016 --> 11:02.950
You know, he... he hated
credit cards

11:03.018 --> 11:04.883
and he... he carried
hundreds in cash.

11:04.954 --> 11:06.444
The money was gone?

11:06.522 --> 11:08.490
Along with a very
expensive watch.

11:08.557 --> 11:10.457
Gold with diamonds.

11:10.526 --> 11:12.619
Well, the police
may have a point.

11:12.695 --> 11:14.822
Oh, I know it looks
like a robbery.

11:14.964 --> 11:17.262
That's what it's
supposed to look like.

11:18.367 --> 11:20.597
Okay, if it was murder,

11:21.036 --> 11:22.970
then who'd want
to kill him?

11:24.473 --> 11:26.532
Please try to understand.

11:27.009 --> 11:28.408
Once I say it out loud

11:28.511 --> 11:30.502
nothing will ever be
the same again.

11:30.579 --> 11:32.604
That's why I didn't dare
tell the police.

11:32.681 --> 11:34.012
What if I'm wrong?

11:35.117 --> 11:38.143
Well, if you are, no one
will ever know but you and me.

11:38.821 --> 11:41.153
When my designs
first started to sell

11:41.290 --> 11:44.589
and the business started to
grow beyond our wildest hopes,

11:44.660 --> 11:47.356
Alan, Bart and I signed
a partnership agreement

11:47.429 --> 11:49.624
with a special death benefit.

11:49.865 --> 11:51.526
How special?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.363
Survivor gets all.

11:54.637 --> 11:56.161
Don't you see?

11:56.272 --> 11:58.672
I think Bart Lindsey
killed Alan Russell.

11:59.408 --> 12:01.399
And I'm afraid I'm next.

12:02.011 --> 12:04.070
Three minus one is two.

12:04.246 --> 12:06.612
And two is
one survivor too many.

12:11.754 --> 12:13.619
You can't be serious.

12:13.689 --> 12:16.681
You wish to borrow
the Rolls Royce of cameras?

12:16.825 --> 12:18.986
I only want to use it
for a little while.

12:19.061 --> 12:20.756
I promise I'll bring it
right back.

12:20.829 --> 12:22.922
Do you have any idea
how much Robin Masters paid

12:22.998 --> 12:24.795
for that
photographic equipment?

12:24.867 --> 12:26.129
No. Not offhand.

12:26.201 --> 12:28.328
Almost the price
of an automobile.

12:28.404 --> 12:29.632
And you want to use it

12:29.705 --> 12:31.468
to take snapshots
of bathing beauties?

12:31.540 --> 12:32.871
Fashion shots.

12:32.942 --> 12:33.909
And the camera

12:33.976 --> 12:35.375
will only be handled
by an expert.

12:35.444 --> 12:37.036
I'm just acting
as his rep.

12:37.112 --> 12:39.103
Higgins, it's just a way
of meeting people

12:39.181 --> 12:40.512
without having
to be introduced

12:40.583 --> 12:42.847
as a private investigator.

12:42.918 --> 12:45.250
I can see why you'd wish
to avoid that stigma.

12:47.222 --> 12:49.417
I promised them
I'd be there at 10:00 sharp

12:49.491 --> 12:50.617
with the camera.

12:50.693 --> 12:52.854
I think I can
still make it.

12:53.262 --> 12:54.627
I doubt that.

13:03.472 --> 13:04.905
Hi, guys.

13:05.140 --> 13:07.301
Higgins, why do you have
to make a production

13:07.376 --> 13:09.469
out of everything
all the time?

13:09.678 --> 13:12.010
All I want is to just
borrow this stuff.

13:12.081 --> 13:13.548
C- can't we make a deal?

13:14.717 --> 13:16.651
Zeus, Apollo, at ease.

13:20.789 --> 13:22.086
What sort of a deal?

13:23.392 --> 13:26.259
What I had in mind
was s-sort of a trade-off.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.163
On my terms?

13:29.398 --> 13:30.831
Naturally.

13:31.567 --> 13:34.195
You really are desperate.
Very well.

13:34.970 --> 13:36.267
Well, open it!

13:36.338 --> 13:37.703
You haven't heard my terms.

13:37.773 --> 13:40.708
Can't you talk and unlock
at the same time?

13:46.215 --> 13:49.150
First, there's the Ferrari.

13:49.218 --> 13:51.118
Uh, no. We have been
all through that.

13:51.186 --> 13:53.620
Robin has said that I am to
have the use of that car.

13:53.689 --> 13:54.781
We'll share it.

13:54.857 --> 13:56.484
You can have it
Sunday through Tuesday,

13:56.558 --> 13:58.924
I'll take it Wednesday
through Saturday.

13:59.662 --> 14:02.460
You get it Saturday
and I get it Sunday?

14:02.831 --> 14:04.025
Precisely.

14:06.201 --> 14:07.725
Is it a deal, Magnum?

14:07.870 --> 14:09.030
It's a deal.

14:09.872 --> 14:11.772
Good. Secondly,

14:12.508 --> 14:13.941
I had a cable
from Robin Masters

14:14.009 --> 14:15.567
last evening.

14:15.644 --> 14:17.669
A Nobel Prize-winning poet

14:18.380 --> 14:20.211
is coming in
day after tomorrow.

14:20.282 --> 14:22.045
He needs
a quiet place to work

14:22.117 --> 14:25.143
to write a verse trilogy
about the Hundred Years' War.

14:26.055 --> 14:27.579
The guest house
would be perfect.

14:27.656 --> 14:28.953
Don't you agree?

14:29.024 --> 14:30.150
Well, I suppose

14:30.225 --> 14:32.352
that I could sleep
on the patio or the beach.

14:32.895 --> 14:33.919
Not at all.

14:33.996 --> 14:36.487
You may have a small room
in the servants' wing.

14:36.565 --> 14:38.556
May I have the camera,
Higgins?

14:38.634 --> 14:39.828
My hands are clean.

14:39.902 --> 14:40.994
Bear in mind

14:41.070 --> 14:42.560
this is a very
delicate instrument.

14:42.638 --> 14:43.866
Right.

14:48.143 --> 14:49.735
If Miss Kona calls,

14:49.812 --> 14:51.803
will you tell her
that I'm on my way, please?

14:51.880 --> 14:53.905
Uh, don't you want to know
about the lenses?

14:53.982 --> 14:56.473
The 80 mm, the wide-angle 50,
and the telephoto 150?

14:56.552 --> 14:57.678
Not necessary,
old boy.

14:57.753 --> 14:58.685
What advice
could you

14:58.754 --> 15:00.551
possibly give
a real expert?

15:02.658 --> 15:04.683
Shouldn't my cover-up
be draped and pinned

15:04.760 --> 15:06.227
for maximum effect?

15:07.963 --> 15:09.487
Ordinarily, but, uh,

15:09.631 --> 15:11.758
Mr. Alex likes to try
something different.

15:11.834 --> 15:13.199
Don't you, Mr. Alex?

15:13.268 --> 15:14.826
Absolutely.

15:14.903 --> 15:18.361
Take... take 'em off, giris.
Take them totally off.

15:21.343 --> 15:23.709
Um, Lani, W-Wendy...

15:23.779 --> 15:25.838
Wendy?
Uh, Wendy, would you...

15:26.615 --> 15:30.415
l- lean just a... a wee bit
to your left?

15:31.687 --> 15:34.679
What you need is a fan
to blow back our hair.

15:35.157 --> 15:37.682
Uh, L-Lani, uh-huh,

15:38.093 --> 15:41.824
would you lean a...
a little bit to... to your right?

15:43.532 --> 15:45.727
Wouldn't a neutral background
help bring out

15:45.801 --> 15:48.668
the colored patterns
in the swimsuit?

15:48.804 --> 15:50.704
Uh, everybody uses neutral.

15:50.773 --> 15:52.866
Mr. Alex likes
to get away from that.

15:52.941 --> 15:54.238
Don't you, Mr. Alex?

15:54.309 --> 15:55.298
Uh-huh.

15:55.410 --> 15:57.537
Didn't you forget something?

15:57.613 --> 15:59.171
We're not backlit.

16:00.482 --> 16:04.009
Mr. Alex only goes
for the natural look.

16:05.988 --> 16:07.580
This is natural?

16:09.958 --> 16:11.186
Hold it.

16:13.295 --> 16:15.229
I hope we're not
interrupting you.

16:15.297 --> 16:16.958
Oh, not at all.

16:17.032 --> 16:19.466
Uh, Mr. Alex was about
to take a creative break.

16:19.535 --> 16:22.060
Uh, ladies,
this way, please.

16:22.137 --> 16:23.399
Do you think
it was wise

16:23.472 --> 16:25.531
to go ahead and schedule
the photo session?

16:25.607 --> 16:26.631
Why not?

16:26.708 --> 16:28.733
Jan feels we need additional
publicity pictures

16:28.811 --> 16:30.244
for the Los Ángeles papers

16:30.312 --> 16:32.143
to, uh, create interest
for our showing.

16:32.214 --> 16:33.476
But so soon.

16:33.549 --> 16:36.347
It was a blow to all of us, Wayne,
but we're still in business.

16:36.418 --> 16:37.942
Mmm-hmm. Absolutely.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.820
I'm Bart Lindsey,
Jan's partner.

16:41.523 --> 16:44.219
This is Thomas Maxwell,
Mr. Alex's rep.

16:44.293 --> 16:45.726
Pleased to meet you.

16:45.794 --> 16:47.785
I'm sure you've
seen Alex's photos

16:47.863 --> 16:49.592
in all the better
fashion magazines.

16:49.665 --> 16:51.530
<i>Cosmo, Harper's, Ephemeral.</i>

16:51.600 --> 16:52.760
Hmm. I'm sure I have.

16:52.835 --> 16:54.894
I don't recall
drawin' up a contract.

16:54.970 --> 16:57.063
Oh, it was
a verbal agreement.

16:57.172 --> 16:59.697
This is our attorney,
Wayne Lochman.

16:59.775 --> 17:01.766
We like to put
everything in writing.

17:01.844 --> 17:03.209
It's the only way.

17:03.512 --> 17:05.343
We're going out for coffee,
Mr. Maxwell.

17:05.414 --> 17:06.881
Would you care to join us?

17:06.949 --> 17:08.075
No, I've got work to do,

17:08.150 --> 17:09.946
but thanks
for the nice invitation.

17:10.018 --> 17:12.248
Now I can't wait
to see those pictures.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.310
Neither can I.

17:13.387 --> 17:15.015
I'll have a work contract
drawn up.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.454
I hate verbal agreements.

17:16.525 --> 17:17.719
So do I.

17:23.098 --> 17:24.759
Mr. Alex,
I have got work to do,

17:24.833 --> 17:27.324
so, uh, call me
if you want anything.

17:27.769 --> 17:29.134
Sure.

17:29.738 --> 17:31.638
What more could I want?

17:35.410 --> 17:38.277
Uh, all right,
my pretties,

17:38.347 --> 17:40.076
let's take pictures.

17:40.515 --> 17:43.040
Okay, off with those
wraps, please.

17:43.518 --> 17:45.543
And up on the ramp.

17:53.729 --> 17:55.822
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what I was looking for,</i>

17:55.898 --> 17:58.162
<i>and I wasn't sure</i>
<i>I'd know when I found it.</i>

17:58.233 --> 18:00.497
<i>But at least I did know</i>
<i>where to look.</i>

18:26.862 --> 18:28.454
Keep... keep circling.

18:49.818 --> 18:51.581
Take root and heist 'em!

18:51.653 --> 18:53.712
"Take root and heist 'em"?

18:54.189 --> 18:56.749
Don't mouth off, or I'll put
another hole in your head.

18:56.825 --> 18:59.055
I'm the chief security officer
of this building.

18:59.127 --> 19:00.651
And I caught you red-handed.

19:00.729 --> 19:02.560
You were ransacking
that desk.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.360
Me? Ransacking?

19:04.800 --> 19:05.892
You're gonna laugh

19:05.968 --> 19:08.027
when I tell you what I was
really looking for.

19:10.072 --> 19:11.232
Jelly beans.

19:12.374 --> 19:13.466
No, wait.

19:13.542 --> 19:14.975
I know that sounds weird,

19:15.043 --> 19:17.511
but my photographer
suffers from low blood sugar.

19:17.579 --> 19:19.740
He gets kind of irritable
and temperamental.

19:19.815 --> 19:21.339
So I suddenly thought

19:21.416 --> 19:23.577
I had to find
some jelly beans.

19:23.652 --> 19:24.914
Just shut up
and face the wall.

19:24.987 --> 19:26.045
No, wait, you don't...

19:26.121 --> 19:27.952
I said, face the wall!

19:29.391 --> 19:31.188
Ox, let him go!

19:31.259 --> 19:33.090
I caught him going
through the desk.

19:33.161 --> 19:35.152
He said he was looking
for jelly beans.

19:35.230 --> 19:36.390
Jelly beans?

19:36.531 --> 19:38.692
Yeah, uh, I was sure
that Jan said

19:38.767 --> 19:40.257
there were some
in her office.

19:41.570 --> 19:43.902
Uh, you're
in the wrong office.

19:45.607 --> 19:47.302
My office is
down the corridor,

19:47.376 --> 19:48.775
off the workroom.

19:48.877 --> 19:49.866
Oh.

19:50.345 --> 19:51.972
How embarrassing.

19:52.581 --> 19:54.742
Come on.
Bye.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.490
Anything missing?

20:04.693 --> 20:05.955
Not that I can see.

20:06.028 --> 20:08.189
Well, maybe he didn't find
what he was lookin' for.

20:14.970 --> 20:16.096
Hurt?

20:16.705 --> 20:18.229
No, it's cold.

20:20.142 --> 20:22.167
To make it worse,
I drew a blank.

20:22.711 --> 20:25.043
I'd hate to run into him
in a dark alley.

20:25.113 --> 20:27.479
He's not so terrific
in a lit room.

20:27.549 --> 20:29.847
Did you ever wonder
about the timing of all this?

20:29.918 --> 20:32.409
Russell's killed just as you're
about to show your new designs.

20:32.487 --> 20:33.476
Why now?

20:33.722 --> 20:35.747
Only Bart
can answer that.

20:36.825 --> 20:39.487
Unless Russell knew why
and put it down on paper.

20:40.762 --> 20:42.457
You whistle
if Ox comes back.

20:42.531 --> 20:44.624
I'm gonna go look
for jelly beans.

21:03.485 --> 21:05.146
Oh, I-I'm s-sorry.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.450
L... I didn't know this office
was being used.

21:07.522 --> 21:08.784
Well, I'm Florence Russell.

21:08.857 --> 21:11.223
I came to pick up my
husband's personal belongings.

21:11.293 --> 21:12.817
Are you the photographer?

21:12.894 --> 21:14.885
Uh, no. I'm his rep.

21:15.497 --> 21:17.692
I heard they were
taking pictures today.

21:17.766 --> 21:19.734
I know everybody else
around here.

21:19.801 --> 21:22.531
Well, you... you have my deepest
sympathies, Mrs. Russell.

21:22.604 --> 21:25.334
I never had the privilege
of meeting your husband

21:25.407 --> 21:26.669
but everyone
I've talked to

21:26.741 --> 21:28.174
says he was
a fine man.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.710
Yes, he was.

21:30.112 --> 21:31.170
Thank you.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.339
Well, uh, I didn't mean
to intrude.

21:33.415 --> 21:35.042
Uh, we were just
looking for a place

21:35.117 --> 21:36.516
to keep our equipment.

21:36.585 --> 21:37.813
It's all right.

21:37.886 --> 21:39.945
There wasn't much
of Alan in this room.

21:40.021 --> 21:41.784
Just spare
reading glasses,

21:41.857 --> 21:43.552
a few photographs,
some letters.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.650
You seem to have
a lot of paper in there.

21:45.727 --> 21:47.922
Well, I cleaned everything
out of his desk.

21:47.996 --> 21:49.190
Everything?
Yeah.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.788
I'll go through it later.
At home.

21:50.866 --> 21:52.925
You know, I could
drop this off for you.

21:53.001 --> 21:54.593
It'd be
no trouble at all.

21:54.669 --> 21:56.660
It's not necessary.
I have my own car.

21:56.738 --> 21:58.262
Well, let me
give you a hand.

21:58.340 --> 21:59.568
No, really,
it's all right.

21:59.641 --> 22:01.040
You could open
the door for me.

22:01.109 --> 22:02.872
Oh, yeah, sure.
Of course.

22:03.979 --> 22:05.344
Thank you.

22:23.298 --> 22:27.496
Okay, now move your head
a little bit to the right.

22:29.237 --> 22:32.468
No, no, no, no.
Put it back the way it was.

22:34.376 --> 22:36.401
See, I don't have time
for this anymore.

22:36.478 --> 22:38.946
I've got to open for lunch
in another five minutes.

22:41.016 --> 22:43.177
Turn around.
Put your hand in your pocket.

22:44.386 --> 22:45.512
Good.

22:47.389 --> 22:48.617
What's this
all about, anyway?

22:48.690 --> 22:49.918
You latch on
to a camera,

22:49.991 --> 22:51.618
you play photographer
for 30 minutes,

22:51.693 --> 22:53.456
and right away you think
you're Skavullo.

22:53.528 --> 22:54.586
Ska-who?

22:54.663 --> 22:56.494
Never mind.
Are you done?

22:57.065 --> 22:58.293
Almost.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.529
Look up, look up,
look up.

23:09.377 --> 23:11.470
A man's life sure looks
different through a camera.

23:11.546 --> 23:12.478
Good.

23:12.547 --> 23:14.412
It's like a new worid
has opened up for me.

23:14.482 --> 23:16.313
Can't it open up
without me?

23:21.223 --> 23:23.214
You know,
something's not right.

23:23.692 --> 23:25.523
You need somethin',
you know,

23:26.094 --> 23:28.289
to give you
a little more atmosphere.

23:29.431 --> 23:32.093
You need to hold a gun.
You got a gun?

23:32.200 --> 23:34.498
No, T.C.,
I don't have a gun.

23:34.603 --> 23:36.002
How about a knife?

23:39.574 --> 23:40.563
T.C.

23:41.543 --> 23:42.567
Four minutes.

23:42.644 --> 23:44.669
In four minutes
we open for lunch.

23:44.746 --> 23:46.077
I hear ya,
I hear ya.

23:46.147 --> 23:48.240
It's just that,
for the first time,

23:48.350 --> 23:50.511
I- I-I'm...
I'm seein' the real you.

23:51.052 --> 23:54.146
Like I'm finally seein'
the essence of the man.

23:54.556 --> 23:55.682
No kiddin'?

23:59.094 --> 24:00.459
What do you see?

24:01.930 --> 24:03.591
I see a man

24:04.132 --> 24:06.600
that is lean and mean.

24:07.836 --> 24:09.565
Stick your
left leg out.

24:09.638 --> 24:11.230
Lean and mean, huh?

24:15.377 --> 24:17.242
Very together! Ha-ha!

24:21.383 --> 24:22.816
That's good.

24:24.619 --> 24:26.348
What do you mean, that's all?
That's it?

24:26.921 --> 24:29.389
Well, you got
to open up for lunch.

24:29.891 --> 24:32.826
Well, wait a minute. We've still
got a couple of minutes, T.C.

24:32.894 --> 24:34.885
Yeah, well, I don't
want to be a nuisance.

24:34.963 --> 24:37.329
Hey, if you're a nuisance
I'll tell you, okay?

24:37.399 --> 24:40.630
Um, still want me
to hold the knife?

24:41.202 --> 24:43.762
Uh, would you hold a gun?
You got a gun?

24:45.674 --> 24:47.141
I'll be right back.

25:11.166 --> 25:12.224
Hello, Higgins.

25:18.206 --> 25:20.538
It's a nice place.
Is it yours?

25:20.675 --> 25:21.937
Loosely speaking.

25:23.378 --> 25:25.903
Oh, here's someone
I'd like you to meet.

25:25.980 --> 25:27.379
Miss Kona,
this is Higgins.

25:27.449 --> 25:29.076
He handles security
in this place,

25:29.150 --> 25:30.708
and he does
a wonderful job.

25:30.785 --> 25:33.219
Don't try to get around me
with such an obvious...

25:33.288 --> 25:34.312
Kona?

25:34.389 --> 25:37.051
That wouldn't be Jan Kona,
the designer, by any chance?

25:37.125 --> 25:38.524
Yes, it is.

25:38.893 --> 25:40.827
I understand your new
collection of beachwear

25:40.895 --> 25:41.919
is quite superb.

25:42.364 --> 25:43.388
Thank you.

25:43.631 --> 25:46.225
Uh, Miss Kona will be staying
with us for a couple of days.

25:46.301 --> 25:48.360
She has reason to believe
her life is in danger,

25:48.436 --> 25:51.132
and I thought she would feel
much safer here with you.

25:51.339 --> 25:52.397
And the guys.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.870
Zeus and Apollo.

25:55.410 --> 25:56.707
Apollo and Zeus.

25:56.778 --> 25:57.870
Of course.

25:58.213 --> 25:59.475
They're magnificent.

25:59.547 --> 26:00.775
Yes, they are.

26:02.684 --> 26:05.175
On behalf of Robin Masters,
it is a pleasure to offer you

26:05.253 --> 26:06.982
the hospitality of his house,
Miss Kona.

26:07.055 --> 26:08.079
Thank you.

26:08.156 --> 26:09.521
I hate to be a bother,

26:09.591 --> 26:11.149
but I really do
appreciate this.

26:11.226 --> 26:13.319
You'll find the security here
most reliable.

26:13.828 --> 26:16.058
Tonight, when you retire
to your bedchamber,

26:16.131 --> 26:17.496
you can rest assured

26:17.565 --> 26:19.726
your privacy will
not be disturbed.

26:19.801 --> 26:21.132
By anyone.

26:33.348 --> 26:35.714
You think Bart Lindsey's
out to kill her?

26:35.784 --> 26:37.081
I don't know.

26:37.152 --> 26:39.882
He sure had the motive and the
opportunity to kill Russell.

26:39.954 --> 26:42.582
In fact, it would've been
easy for him to shoot Russell.

26:42.657 --> 26:44.682
Cross the stage
behind the curtain,

26:44.759 --> 26:47.284
come out the other side
during the applause.

26:47.362 --> 26:49.489
See, I timed it out
while T.C. Was doing

26:49.564 --> 26:52.362
one of the worst impressions of
a photographer I have ever seen.

26:53.535 --> 26:56.299
This is great. So that means this
guy's runnin' around loose, then?

26:56.371 --> 26:57.395
Oh, no, Jan's safe.

26:57.472 --> 26:59.064
I left her at the estate with Higgins.

26:59.140 --> 27:00.368
And the dogs.

27:01.109 --> 27:03.202
Well, so what's your
next move, Sherlock?

27:03.278 --> 27:04.267
Oh.

27:04.679 --> 27:06.271
Here's a list
of all the people

27:06.347 --> 27:07.746
I met at the office.

27:10.018 --> 27:11.576
Florence Russell,

27:11.653 --> 27:13.746
Wayne Lochman,
Wendy Klein, Ox.

27:14.155 --> 27:15.315
Ox? That's a name?

27:15.390 --> 27:17.517
That's the security guard's
nickname.

27:17.659 --> 27:19.593
I think his real name
is King Kong.

27:19.661 --> 27:21.492
So, what am I supposed
to do with this?

27:21.563 --> 27:23.929
Well, I would like you
to run the usual checks.

27:23.998 --> 27:25.898
And see if anything
unusual pops up.

27:25.967 --> 27:27.832
Like a possible motive
to kill Russell.

27:27.902 --> 27:30.803
Then you're not sure that this
Lindsey guy knocked his partner off?

27:30.872 --> 27:32.931
No, I'm
not 100 percent sure.

27:33.007 --> 27:35.168
Well, then it could
have been Jan Kona.

27:35.243 --> 27:36.767
No, l... I don't think so.

27:38.847 --> 27:40.212
Yeah, it could've been.

28:31.365 --> 28:32.730
This is outrageous.

28:32.799 --> 28:34.733
How dare you roust
a guest from this house

28:34.801 --> 28:36.393
at this hour of the morning.

28:36.470 --> 28:38.097
Well, sir,
I'm Det. Kaio.

28:38.171 --> 28:40.401
And I would like to ask
Miss Kona some questions.

28:40.474 --> 28:43.272
Why don't you simply call her on
the phone at a reasonable hour?

28:43.343 --> 28:46.210
That's all right, Higgins.
Thank you for your help.

28:47.214 --> 28:48.511
I demand to know why

28:48.615 --> 28:51.209
you want to question Miss Kona
at this ungodly hour.

28:51.285 --> 28:53.310
It's part of a murder
investigation, sir.

28:53.887 --> 28:55.320
What murder?

28:55.422 --> 28:56.855
She already told
the police

28:56.924 --> 28:58.585
all she knows
about Alan Russell.

28:58.659 --> 29:00.490
Not Russell.
The other partner.

29:00.561 --> 29:02.028
He was murdered last night.

29:02.095 --> 29:03.187
Bart Lindsey?

29:10.237 --> 29:12.762
I shall never forgive you
for this, Magnum. Never.

29:12.839 --> 29:14.898
You brought her here
and begged me to take her in

29:14.975 --> 29:16.533
against my better judgment.

29:16.610 --> 29:18.510
Now I find I've been
harboring a murderess

29:18.612 --> 29:20.978
here in Robin Masters' house.

29:21.048 --> 29:22.743
Are you listening to me?

29:22.849 --> 29:23.975
No.

29:34.261 --> 29:36.889
<i>I didn't feel like listening</i>
<i>to what everyone was saying</i>

29:36.964 --> 29:38.727
<i>about the murders</i>
<i>and who committed them.</i>

29:38.799 --> 29:40.323
<i>I just wanted to get away.</i>

29:40.400 --> 29:43.563
<i>The problem was, I could</i>
<i>escape all the speculation,</i>

29:43.637 --> 29:45.628
<i>but I couldn't run</i>
<i>away from my little voice.</i>

29:57.217 --> 29:58.206
Jan?

29:58.685 --> 29:59.709
You all right?

29:59.786 --> 30:00.775
Yeah.

30:00.854 --> 30:01.946
May I ask
who you are?

30:02.022 --> 30:03.046
I'm Thomas Magnum.

30:03.123 --> 30:05.250
I'm a private investigator.
I'm working for Miss Kona.

30:05.325 --> 30:06.257
Is that true?

30:06.326 --> 30:07.315
Yes.

30:07.394 --> 30:10.124
Uh, hold it a minute. Miss Kona
does not have an attorney present,

30:10.197 --> 30:12.290
and I believe she has
the right to remain silent.

30:12.366 --> 30:15.062
I don't want to remain silent.
There's some things I have to say.

30:15.135 --> 30:17.160
Jan, under the circumstances,
I don't think...

30:17.237 --> 30:20.104
I'm sorry. Certain things have
to be brought out into the open.

30:20.173 --> 30:23.006
Well, I'm ready to listen
to anything you have to say.

30:23.076 --> 30:24.100
Thank you.

30:24.177 --> 30:25.235
Tell me,

30:25.379 --> 30:27.574
why did you hire
a private investigator?

30:27.648 --> 30:30.048
I thought Bart Lindsey
killed Alan,

30:30.117 --> 30:31.675
and I was afraid
I was next.

30:31.752 --> 30:32.946
Why would you
think that?

30:33.020 --> 30:34.351
Jan, I think
you've said enough.

30:34.421 --> 30:35.410
Now wait a minute.

30:35.489 --> 30:36.979
Where were you
last night at 11:30,

30:37.057 --> 30:38.684
when Mr. Lindsey
was killed?

30:38.759 --> 30:40.420
She was here
at the estate.

30:40.494 --> 30:42.962
Uh, I went for a walk
along the beach.

30:43.664 --> 30:46.360
Well, I do that often
to clear my head.

30:46.566 --> 30:47.999
No one saw you?

30:48.301 --> 30:50.861
Um, Higgins may have seen me
leave the house around 11:00.

30:51.238 --> 30:53.035
It was 10:52 p.m. Precisely.

30:53.106 --> 30:54.130
Just hold it.

30:54.307 --> 30:55.740
The bomb that blew up
Lindsey's car

30:55.809 --> 30:58.141
could've been planted
at any time yesterday.

30:58.211 --> 31:00.145
So where you were
isn't even relevant.

31:00.213 --> 31:03.979
Now I suggest, Sergeant, that
unless you've got some kind
of formal charge to make,

31:04.051 --> 31:05.518
that Miss Kona
is free to go.

31:05.585 --> 31:06.813
Oh, for now, maybe.

31:06.887 --> 31:08.548
But don't plan
on leaving the island.

31:08.622 --> 31:10.556
But I'm showing my designs
on the mainland...

31:10.624 --> 31:12.421
Jan, he doesn't wanna
know about that now.

31:12.492 --> 31:14.426
But I can't leave.
Let's just go for a drive.

31:14.494 --> 31:16.428
We'll talk in the car.
Thank you, Sergeant.

31:17.330 --> 31:18.763
Mr. Higgins.

31:52.365 --> 31:54.333
<i>We went to see Wayne Lochman.</i>

31:54.401 --> 31:55.868
<i>It took him about 10 minutes</i>

31:55.936 --> 31:57.665
<i>to chew Jan out</i>
<i>about what she had said,</i>

31:57.738 --> 31:59.933
<i>but you could tell</i>
<i>his heart wasn't in it.</i>

32:00.006 --> 32:02.133
<i>After all,</i>
<i>how could you yell at someone</i>

32:02.209 --> 32:04.473
<i>who's lost her two partners</i>
<i>to murder?</i>

32:08.248 --> 32:10.546
I guess I was wrong
about Bart.

32:12.519 --> 32:15.511
Well, survivor gets all
was the perfect motive

32:15.589 --> 32:18.285
until you turned out
to be the survivor.

32:18.358 --> 32:20.758
Then why were
Alan and Bart killed?

32:20.827 --> 32:22.317
I don't know.

32:23.430 --> 32:25.694
Maybe somebody
wants you to get it all.

32:25.766 --> 32:28.257
Remind me not to send
a thank you note.

32:29.970 --> 32:32.029
Or that the, uh, two killings

32:32.105 --> 32:34.630
were done by different people,
with different motives.

32:35.642 --> 32:36.700
What?

32:36.777 --> 32:38.074
Jan, I think
we have to examine

32:38.145 --> 32:39.942
all the possibilities.

32:40.013 --> 32:42.106
Including there's
only one killer,

32:42.382 --> 32:43.815
and it's me?

32:44.484 --> 32:46.179
I didn't say that.

32:46.419 --> 32:48.887
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

32:52.626 --> 32:54.890
<i>My gut told me</i>
<i>Jan was innocent.</i>

32:54.961 --> 32:56.155
<i>On the other hand,</i>

32:56.229 --> 32:57.924
<i>logic said she</i>
<i>probably did it.</i>

32:58.165 --> 32:59.860
<i>I hated logic.</i>

32:59.933 --> 33:02.458
<i>Sometimes it really</i>
<i>gets in the way.</i>

33:35.235 --> 33:36.259
Jan,

33:36.970 --> 33:37.994
come on.

33:38.371 --> 33:39.804
It's too dangerous
out here.

33:39.873 --> 33:41.135
Go away.

33:41.808 --> 33:44.572
I don't believe
you killed them. Honest.

33:45.078 --> 33:47.603
I've heard the stories
about myself.

33:47.948 --> 33:49.848
Sure, I was ambitious.

33:49.916 --> 33:51.907
I promoted myself
to Alan and Bart,

33:51.985 --> 33:54.681
I took every opportunity
they gave me.

33:54.754 --> 33:57.245
But I never went to bed
with either one of them.

33:57.324 --> 33:59.724
Alan was my dearest friend.

34:01.194 --> 34:04.061
I never liked Bart,
but I didn't kill him.

34:04.731 --> 34:06.961
I wanted to be somebody.

34:07.033 --> 34:09.763
It was finally
happening for me, and...

34:11.371 --> 34:14.168
Come on.
Don't give up.

34:14.574 --> 34:16.871
No matter how bad
things look,

34:17.177 --> 34:19.168
we'll... we'll just
sort this out.

34:19.246 --> 34:20.713
Don't worry.
Come on.

34:21.348 --> 34:22.507
Don't worry.

34:35.695 --> 34:37.663
<i>My leads had gotten so slim</i>

34:37.731 --> 34:40.029
<i>that I was forced</i>
<i>to start examining wreckage.</i>

34:40.100 --> 34:42.762
<i>Fortunately I had T.C.</i>
<i>To help me out.</i>

34:42.902 --> 34:44.893
<i>I just hoped we found</i>
<i>what we were looking for</i>

34:44.971 --> 34:47.166
<i>before the police found us.</i>

35:01.655 --> 35:03.282
Bet that's it.

35:09.029 --> 35:11.088
Give me a hand
with this, will ya?

35:15.402 --> 35:16.664
Yeah, this is it.

35:16.736 --> 35:19.432
Oh, wow.
Somebody really did a job on this.

35:19.572 --> 35:22.200
Looks like it might've been
a nice car at one time, too.

35:22.275 --> 35:23.367
Careful
what you touch.

35:23.510 --> 35:26.479
I don't know whether they
finished going over it yet.

35:31.451 --> 35:32.850
What do you think?

35:33.086 --> 35:34.485
Looks good.

35:34.621 --> 35:37.215
Mind if I drive around
the block a couple of times?

35:37.290 --> 35:39.383
Come on, T.C.,
I need an expert opinion.

35:42.796 --> 35:44.730
Doesn't this
remind you of Nam?

35:45.765 --> 35:49.166
You mean the way Charlie Cong
used to booby-trap our jeeps?

35:49.235 --> 35:51.260
No, I was thinkin'
the other way around.

35:51.338 --> 35:53.863
The way we used to do it
with claymores.

35:53.940 --> 35:55.532
Yeah, you're right.

35:55.608 --> 35:58.668
I mean, look at the way it blew
straight up the steerin' column.

35:59.679 --> 36:00.668
Oh, man.

36:02.082 --> 36:05.074
Poor guy in the driver's seat
never had a prayer.

36:05.151 --> 36:08.552
If you were in the market for an APM
these days, where would you shop?

36:08.855 --> 36:10.186
On Oahu?
Yeah.

36:10.890 --> 36:12.255
I don't know.

36:12.325 --> 36:14.384
An Army or Marine
supply depot.

36:14.461 --> 36:17.396
You still know that supply sergeant
with the Swiss bank account?

36:17.464 --> 36:19.694
Yeah. I don't know
where there's much call

36:19.766 --> 36:21.734
for anti-personnel mines
on the black market,

36:21.801 --> 36:23.029
but if there is,

36:23.103 --> 36:25.663
he's the one that can
tell me where to score.

36:34.381 --> 36:37.009
If they catch me,
I'll lose my license.

36:38.918 --> 36:41.045
I told you not
to touch anything.

36:41.121 --> 36:43.988
There's something here.
Well, don't touch it.

36:44.057 --> 36:45.615
You want me to put it back?

36:45.692 --> 36:48.252
'Cause if I can't touch it,
I can't open it.

36:48.328 --> 36:50.057
Touch it a little.

36:57.203 --> 36:59.228
A gold watch and a wallet?

37:03.843 --> 37:05.868
Lindsey could've
taken this to make

37:05.945 --> 37:07.845
Russell's murder
look like a robbery.

37:07.914 --> 37:10.439
Yeah, but he wouldn't hide it
under his own car.

37:10.517 --> 37:13.645
You know, it must've been placed there
about the same time that mine was.

37:13.720 --> 37:17.087
If Lindsey killed Russell,
who blew him away?

37:32.787 --> 37:34.092
Yes?
<i>It's us, T.M.</i>

37:34.117 --> 37:35.426
Come on in, guys.

37:36.057 --> 37:37.490
What are you doing?

37:37.558 --> 37:39.822
I am opening the front gates
for some guests.

37:39.894 --> 37:41.418
Guests?
Whose guests?

37:41.496 --> 37:44.260
Mine. Relax, Higgins.
It's just Rick and T.C.

37:44.465 --> 37:45.454
Oh.

37:45.766 --> 37:47.324
Speaking of guests,

37:47.468 --> 37:50.164
may I remind you that
the Nobel Prize-winning poet

37:50.238 --> 37:53.173
will arrive tomorrow morning
to occupy your premises?

37:53.241 --> 37:54.230
Oh, yeah.

37:54.542 --> 37:57.010
Higgins, could I, uh,
borrow some boxes

37:57.078 --> 37:59.444
for my little move
to the servants' quarters?

37:59.514 --> 38:00.811
Yes, of course.

38:00.882 --> 38:02.782
And I would like to air out
the guesthouse

38:02.850 --> 38:04.112
before he arrives.

38:04.185 --> 38:06.050
It would help make up
for your part

38:06.120 --> 38:07.917
in the police raid
of this morning,

38:07.989 --> 38:09.456
if you would
clean out your closet

38:09.524 --> 38:10.855
within the next half hour.

38:10.925 --> 38:13.553
Thank you for all
the advance notice.

38:14.195 --> 38:15.321
Don't mention it.

38:15.396 --> 38:16.385
Thomas.

38:16.464 --> 38:17.488
In the den.

38:17.565 --> 38:18.532
Incidentally,

38:18.599 --> 38:21.625
two filters are missing
from the camera equipment,

38:21.702 --> 38:24.466
and the batteries for the
flash are totally dead.

38:24.539 --> 38:26.166
Gee, I wonder why?

38:26.340 --> 38:28.968
Perhaps your expert
could answer that.

38:29.343 --> 38:30.708
Hey, Higgie baby.

38:30.845 --> 38:32.039
Hello, Mr. Alex.

38:32.113 --> 38:33.375
How's everything,
Higgins?

38:33.447 --> 38:34.471
Splendid.

38:34.549 --> 38:36.983
Well, you guys didn't come
here to talk to Higgins.

38:37.051 --> 38:38.678
Rick, did you check
those names for me?

38:38.753 --> 38:40.482
Yeah, but I had trouble
with the woman.

38:40.555 --> 38:42.318
You only gave me her
married name... Rick.

38:42.390 --> 38:44.381
Oh, all right.
Here it is.

38:45.259 --> 38:46.988
Thanks. Uh, T.C.

38:47.695 --> 38:49.959
I knew this investigative
business was easy,

38:50.031 --> 38:51.896
else you wouldn't be in it.

38:51.966 --> 38:53.866
You saw the man
and you got the word.

38:53.935 --> 38:55.698
Right, and right again.

38:56.070 --> 38:57.662
Well, what did
he say?

38:57.772 --> 38:58.796
Oh.

38:58.873 --> 39:02.172
Well, he said
that anyone in the know

39:02.243 --> 39:03.835
could get an APM

39:03.911 --> 39:05.401
by simply picking up
the telephone.

39:05.479 --> 39:07.071
No questions asked. Hmm!

39:07.448 --> 39:08.437
Uh-huh.

39:08.649 --> 39:11.482
Take a look at the bottom
of that bio right there.

39:15.756 --> 39:18.156
Jan's still at the office.
I got to get over there.

39:18.226 --> 39:20.023
Rick, call
a Det. Sgt. Kaio

39:20.094 --> 39:21.891
and tell him all
about this. Thanks.

39:21.963 --> 39:22.952
Kaio.
Magnum!

39:23.397 --> 39:25.228
What about your move?

39:26.200 --> 39:28.031
Don't expect me
to pack for you.

39:28.102 --> 39:29.694
I'm not your valet.

39:32.206 --> 39:33.696
Hey, what's
going on here?

39:33.774 --> 39:36.265
I don't know,
but Higgins is getting worse.

39:39.313 --> 39:40.302
Tell me,

39:42.550 --> 39:44.882
do you gentlemen
have a favorite charity?

39:44.952 --> 39:46.249
Uh, yeah. Sure.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.686
Yeah, we got a couple of 'em.
Why, Higgins?

39:48.756 --> 39:50.849
I thought I might
donate some clothes

39:50.925 --> 39:52.790
and other
miscellaneous belongings.

39:52.860 --> 39:53.884
Oh.

39:53.961 --> 39:55.326
Great.

40:24.158 --> 40:25.557
Who's there?

40:27.161 --> 40:29.152
Ox? Is that you?

40:31.899 --> 40:33.867
I know somebody's here.

41:08.436 --> 41:09.698
Florence!

41:30.691 --> 41:33.023
Where do you think
you're going?

41:34.395 --> 41:35.760
Hi. Remember me?

41:36.197 --> 41:37.323
Yeah.

41:39.533 --> 41:42.058
<i>My dad gave me</i>
<i>a few words of advice</i>

41:42.136 --> 41:43.763
<i>that I've always tried</i>
<i>to live by.</i>

41:43.838 --> 41:45.237
<i>He said:</i>

41:45.306 --> 41:48.673
<i>"Son, never throw a punch</i>
<i>at a redwood tree."</i>

41:49.043 --> 41:50.738
Is Jan still in her office?

41:50.811 --> 41:52.244
This building is closed.

41:52.313 --> 41:54.178
It's not closed
if she's still here.

41:54.248 --> 41:55.840
It is to you.

41:55.983 --> 41:57.644
What about Mrs. Russell?

41:57.718 --> 41:59.686
How'd you know
she was here?

41:59.854 --> 42:01.879
Listen to me, Ox.
No foolin' around this time.

42:01.956 --> 42:04.083
This is deadly serious.
I gotta get up there.

42:04.158 --> 42:05.955
Why? Did you run out
of jelly beans?

42:06.026 --> 42:08.620
Okay, fine, you can ride up
in the elevator with me.

42:08.696 --> 42:11.164
You can watch me
the whole time. Let's go.

42:17.171 --> 42:18.160
Florence.

42:18.639 --> 42:21.540
L... l... I don't understand.
I really don't.

42:21.609 --> 42:23.907
Why... why are you here
with that gun?

42:25.880 --> 42:27.245
I grew up with guns.

42:27.314 --> 42:29.145
I still have
the expert marksmanship medal

42:29.216 --> 42:31.116
that my father gave me.

42:31.185 --> 42:34.120
But... but... but why... why
do you want to shoot me?

42:34.722 --> 42:37.054
Because you killed my Alan.

42:39.460 --> 42:42.293
I can't stand pain
and violence. I hate it.

42:42.396 --> 42:43.454
I love it.

42:43.531 --> 42:45.465
No, wait!
Don't hit me, please.

42:47.868 --> 42:49.563
That way out, clown.
I give up, okay?

42:49.637 --> 42:51.127
Come on.
Okay!

42:53.340 --> 42:55.638
I think this is broken.
Is this... is this bleeding?

42:55.709 --> 42:56.835
Not yet.

43:12.560 --> 43:15.120
You can't hide forever,
Jan, darling.

43:46.126 --> 43:49.289
Jan? You all right?

43:49.396 --> 43:50.488
Yes.

44:00.174 --> 44:02.608
Why are you doing
this, Mrs. Russell?

44:02.676 --> 44:04.303
She helped kill my husband.

44:04.378 --> 44:05.743
That's a lie.

44:05.813 --> 44:07.440
How do you know that?

44:07.515 --> 44:09.415
I saw a letter
that Alan wrote

44:09.483 --> 44:11.110
to the... the clothing
manufacturer

44:11.185 --> 44:13.016
who wanted to buy the company.

44:13.087 --> 44:15.988
And he rejected it,
but he explained

44:16.056 --> 44:19.389
that all three partners
had to agree to a sale.

44:20.394 --> 44:22.954
So you think that Lindsey
killed your husband

44:23.030 --> 44:24.657
to sell the company?

44:24.732 --> 44:27.200
And Jan.
They were in it together.

44:27.501 --> 44:30.470
So you blew Lindsey up
with a claymore mine.

44:32.072 --> 44:33.699
How did you know that?

44:33.774 --> 44:37.175
Found out that your father
was a colonel in Army ordnance

44:37.244 --> 44:39.075
and that you worked
in the supply depot

44:39.146 --> 44:40.977
as a secretary
until two years ago.

44:41.048 --> 44:42.879
Wasn't too hard
to put together.

44:42.950 --> 44:44.918
They... they were lovers.

44:45.119 --> 44:47.587
They... they tried
to kill my Alan.

44:47.655 --> 44:49.520
I heard that Jan
was getting it on

44:49.590 --> 44:51.057
with both partners.

44:51.125 --> 44:53.059
That's not true!

44:53.260 --> 44:55.785
We had
a... a beautiful marriage.

44:56.430 --> 44:58.728
He was never unfaithful.
Never.

45:00.067 --> 45:03.127
If that much wasn't true,
why not the rest?

45:03.203 --> 45:05.000
Yeah, Lindsey killed
your husband,

45:05.072 --> 45:06.937
but he was planning
to kill Jan, too.

45:07.007 --> 45:08.998
You're wrong about her.

45:34.168 --> 45:35.760
You weren't listening.

45:47.247 --> 45:49.875
No, let her be alone.
How are you?

45:50.050 --> 45:51.745
Oh, it's only
a flesh wound.

45:51.885 --> 45:53.682
I always wanted
to say that.

45:53.754 --> 45:55.085
Here,
put that on there.

45:55.155 --> 45:57.248
Oh, but the truth is
it hurts like crazy.

45:57.324 --> 45:58.621
It's all right.
Come on.

45:58.692 --> 46:00.523
Take root and heist 'em!

46:14.208 --> 46:16.676
Well, what do you think?
That's Rick all right.

46:16.744 --> 46:17.836
The essence of the man.

46:17.911 --> 46:19.845
Absolutely. What're you
going to do with it?

46:19.913 --> 46:22.882
Well, I figure I'll have it blown up,
put it in a big chrome frame,

46:22.950 --> 46:25.145
and then give it to Rick
for his birthday or somethin'.

46:25.219 --> 46:26.880
Oh, I'm sure
he'll be very touched.

46:26.954 --> 46:29.821
Yeah. I thought it would look
real good in his office.

46:29.890 --> 46:30.948
You know,
above his desk.

46:31.025 --> 46:32.652
That way everybody
could see it.

46:32.726 --> 46:34.318
He'll want that.

46:39.700 --> 46:41.725
Uh, I'll see you later,
Mr. Alex.

46:41.902 --> 46:43.733
All right.
Take it easy, man.

46:48.375 --> 46:49.603
Hey, Higgins.

46:51.145 --> 46:52.669
Uh, hello, Magnum.

46:52.746 --> 46:54.179
Where are you going?

46:54.248 --> 46:56.716
Uh, the Cumberlands
are, uh, sponsoring a tea

46:56.784 --> 46:58.251
for the Britannic
Seaman's Fund.

46:58.318 --> 46:59.307
Oh, that's right.

46:59.386 --> 47:01.115
That's one of your charities,
isn't it?

47:01.188 --> 47:04.351
I happen to be the chairman
of the Honolulu chapter, yes.

47:04.425 --> 47:06.620
Gee, that makes me feel
all the worse.

47:06.694 --> 47:07.752
What do you mean?

47:07.828 --> 47:08.886
Well, it's Sunday.

47:08.962 --> 47:10.486
And we made that deal
about the car.

47:10.564 --> 47:13.226
You know, you get it Saturday
and I get it Sunday.

47:13.300 --> 47:14.665
See here, Magnum.

47:14.735 --> 47:17.169
The starter's out on the Audi
and I'm late as it is.

47:17.237 --> 47:18.226
Boy,

47:18.739 --> 47:20.861
that makes me feel
awful, Higgins,

47:20.979 --> 47:22.725
because I know
your sense of honor

47:22.750 --> 47:24.243
won't let you back out
on that deal.

47:25.646 --> 47:28.774
Magnum, you have no intention
of using this car today.

47:28.882 --> 47:30.713
Why don't you take the truck?

47:30.784 --> 47:32.581
I can't drive up
to the Cumberlands'

47:32.653 --> 47:34.348
in a pickup truck.

47:35.122 --> 47:36.384
Oh, of course.

47:37.324 --> 47:39.315
Well, I tell you what,
Higgins.

47:39.393 --> 47:40.519
I tell you what,

47:40.594 --> 47:42.585
why don't we just forget
about the whole deal?

47:42.663 --> 47:43.925
That way I can
loan you the car

47:43.997 --> 47:45.897
in good conscience.

47:45.966 --> 47:47.661
That's quite decent
of you, Magnum.

47:47.735 --> 47:49.566
Of course, that also means
that that poet,

47:49.636 --> 47:52.400
the one writing the verse trilogy
of the Hundred Years' War,

47:52.473 --> 47:54.304
will have to find
another place to write.

47:54.374 --> 47:55.363
Magnum.

47:55.442 --> 47:57.034
You know, it would look
very funny,

47:57.111 --> 47:59.238
the chairman
of the Britannic Seaman's Fund

47:59.313 --> 48:00.940
showing up in a truck.

48:02.349 --> 48:03.577
Agreed.

48:04.785 --> 48:06.616
Well, have a nice tea,
Higgins.

48:06.687 --> 48:08.416
And watch those crumpets.

48:09.089 --> 48:10.078
Ta.
