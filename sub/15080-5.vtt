MEMORIZING FACTS
AND THEN REGURGITATING THEM

00:13.684 --> 00:17.438
IN 2,000 CAREFULLY CRAFTED WORDS
IS NOT SCIENCE, PEOPLE.

00:17.438 --> 00:19.190
IT'S INTELLECTUAL BULIMIA.

00:19.190 --> 00:22.563
REAL SCIENCE HAPPENS WHEN
WE EXPLORE WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.

00:22.563 --> 00:25.566

00:25.566 --> 00:28.779
THEY ALL HAD THE IMAGINATION
AND THE GUTS

00:28.779 --> 00:30.781
TO LOOK AT A SET OF FACTS
AND SAY,

00:30.781 --> 00:33.614
"OKAY, BUT...WHAT ABOUT THIS?

00:33.614 --> 00:35.616
AND WHAT IF THAT?"

00:35.616 --> 00:37.498
THEY ASKED QUESTIONS.

WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW,

IN PURSUIT OF IGNORANCE --

IS GOING ON WITH MY FATHER.

AN ASSISTED-LIVING FACILITY.

01:07.398 --> 01:09.820

IN BELMONT PARK,

TO GET OUT OF HIS LIFE.

THE MAN HAS ALZHEIMER'S.

01:15.286 --> 01:17.037
I'M SURE HE WAS UPSET --

01:17.037 --> 01:19.870

I CAN'T TAKE IT.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.582
I JUST WENT THROUGH THIS
WITH BOTH OF MY PARENTS.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.255

TO ME. YOUR FATHER IS ABUSIVE.

MY OWN LIFE TO LIVE.

IT'S NOT SAFE FOR YOU TO STAY
AT THE CONDO ALONE, SO...

TO THIS DUMP.

01:50.941 --> 01:53.154

IN THAT REGARD.

MAKE SENSE OF THAT."

A LOT OF SOCIALIZING FOR WORK?

09:09.009 --> 09:11.431
NOT ONCE
THAT PROJECT STARTED.

WERE AT THE LAB.

WAS SUCH A SHOCK.

OF THE PROJECT.

OF THE PROJECT?

WHERE IT CAN LIVE FOREVER.

SOMETHING THAT CAN BE UPLOADED.

CAN BE DISCREET?

TO INSULT PEOPLE.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.231
THAT'S --
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

11:31.231 --> 11:33.814
L-DUB MUST HAVE
RECOGNIZED YOUR NAME.

11:33.814 --> 11:35.695
L-DUB, DO YOU KNOW
DR. PIERCE?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.448
I MET DR. PIERCE IN 2002
AT THE TED CONFERENCE.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.871
I ASKED HIM TO JOIN
MY TELEKINESIS PROJECT,

11:40.871 --> 11:42.282
BUT HE SAID
HE DIDN'T WANT TO

11:42.282 --> 11:43.954
WASTE HIS TIME
ON MAGICAL THINKING.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.665

HE KNOWS YOU.

11:47.037 --> 11:48.668
YOU SEE THE CAMERAS
AROUND THE ROOM?

11:48.668 --> 11:50.831
L-DUB CAN SEE YOU,

11:50.831 --> 11:53.213
AND HE ASSOCIATES YOUR
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS WITH EMOTION.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.135
BUT HE CAN'T FEEL
THOSE EMOTIONS.

11:55.135 --> 11:57.387
THAT WILL CHANGE.

11:57.387 --> 12:01.471
L-DUB,
SHOW US THE NeuroChip.

12:02.973 --> 12:08.188
THIS IS THE TECHNOLOGY
THAT POWERS L-DUB'S MIND.

12:08.188 --> 12:10.190
IT IS THE FIRST
MICROPROCESSOR

12:10.190 --> 12:14.404
DESIGNED TO MIMIC

COMPLEX ASSOCIATIONS,

THEN ADAPTING
TO MAKE ITSELF MORE EFFICIENT.

12:24.414 --> 12:27.828

HIS OWN MUSIC.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.176
Kate: SO THIS IS
THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

12:36.176 --> 12:38.218
THAT DR. JENNINGS WAS
WORRIED ABOUT PROTECTING.

12:38.218 --> 12:40.340
UNTIL OUR PATENT
IS APPROVED, YES.

12:40.340 --> 12:42.512
IT'S STILL NOT CONSCIOUSNESS.
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.723
IT'S CLOSER
THAN YOU THINK.

12:44.845 --> 12:47.057
IF WE LOAD L-DUB
WITH ENOUGH DATA, WE BELIEVE

12:47.057 --> 12:50.390
THAT HE WILL EVENTUALLY
CROSS THAT LINE...INTO LIFE.

12:50.390 --> 12:52.022
LIKE ABE LINCOLN
IN THE HALL OF PRESIDENTS

AT DISNEYLAND,
EXCEPT HE WAS MADE OF PLASTIC.

12:53.984 --> 12:56.606

12:56.606 --> 12:58.158
IN TWO YEARS,

WILL LIVE IN A BODY

FREE OF SICKNESS,
FREE OF PAIN.

13:07.617 --> 13:10.620

IS SCIENCE-FICTION.

13:10.620 --> 13:12.172
I GOT A QUESTION.

13:12.172 --> 13:17.007

IF DR. JENNINGS HAD ANY ENEMIES?

13:31.141 --> 13:32.812
OF THE WORD "ENEMIES,"
DR. PIERCE.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.484
BUT LIKE YOU AND I, HIS
WORD RECOGNITION ISN'T PERFECT.

13:34.484 --> 13:36.026
MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER
THE QUESTION, THEN.

13:36.026 --> 13:38.148

QUALIFY -- CARTER HUMPHRIES.

IDEA WHEN JENNINGS FOUND ME

AND OFFERED ME
THREE TIMES THE SALARY.

13:46.786 --> 13:50.620
WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS LEAVING,
CARTER LOST IT.

13:50.620 --> 13:54.084

BUT WAY TOO SENSITIVE.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.505
YOU DIDN'T THREATEN HIM

SO, UH, CAN'T GIVE YOU
THE DETAILS.

14:13.563 --> 14:16.146

TO PRESERVE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT
WILL LEAVE ETERNITY IN THE DUST.

HE'D START LOSING CONTROL

38:33.271 --> 38:34.933
OF HIS MIND AND BODY.

38:34.933 --> 38:36.565
HE SAID HE COULDN'T
LIVE THAT WAY,

38:36.565 --> 38:39.938
AND HE NEEDED ME
TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

38:39.938 --> 38:41.740
I WAS HORRIFIED.

38:41.740 --> 38:46.154
I -- I DIDN'T WANT TO HELP
ANYONE DIE, ESPECIALLY NOT HIM.

38:46.154 --> 38:50.579
BUT HE TOLD ME EVERYBODY HAD THE
RIGHT TO DIE ON THEIR OWN TERMS,

38:50.579 --> 38:53.792
AND THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP
THE ETERNITY PROJECT FUNDED

38:53.792 --> 38:56.334
WAS TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE MURDER.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.956
HE DIDN'T WANT HIS CONDITION

38:57.956 --> 38:59.958
TO STOP HIM
FROM CHANGING THE WORLD.

I REALIZED
THERE WAS HONOR IN THAT.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.013
HE NEEDED YOU
TO BE IN ON THE PLAN

39:05.013 --> 39:07.225
BECAUSE HE KNEW
SOMEDAY HE MIGHT FORGET.

FIRST THING I HAD TO DO WAS

39:11.640 --> 39:14.022
ORDER THE PARTS
FOR THE LIQUID-NITROGEN DEVICE.

DR. JENNINGS' IDEA --

39:19.568 --> 39:22.360
A FINAL "SCREW YOU"
FOR SLEEPING WITH HIS WIFE.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.193
THE PARTS CAME,
HE BUILT THE DEVICE,

39:25.193 --> 39:27.866
AND WE PLANTED IT
IN THE VENTS.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.868
JENNINGS TOOK THAT TEST
EVERY MORNING

39:29.868 --> 39:31.540
WHEN YOU WENT OUT
FOR SCONES.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.752
THAT WAY, IF YOU HAD
A CHANGE OF HEART

HAVE BEEN SO BAD

40:15.454 --> 40:18.457
IF HE HAD STUCK AROUND
A LITTLE LONGER?

THINK OF YOUR LIFE AS A STORY.
