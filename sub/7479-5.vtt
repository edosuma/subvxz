WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:08.832
So, Amanda,
tell us a little bit about yourself.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.273
Um, I'm 14.

00:11.478 --> 00:15.608
I like to run and I love BeyoncÃ©.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.208
You have a boyfriend?

00:19.086 --> 00:20.246
I don't know.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.920
What do you mean?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.853
Come on.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.052
Do I?

00:30.297 --> 00:31.855
Yeah.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.499
Definitely.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.225
If you want.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.567
Amanda.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.072
- Daddy.
- Hi, Commander Rehme.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.006
You're videotaping my daughter
in a hot tub?

00:44.211 --> 00:47.578
- It's not like that.
- Get out of here. Now.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.717
Yes, sir.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.414
You should go to bed.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.780
Daniel?

01:27.988 --> 01:29.819
Daniel.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.320
Daniel, are you there?

01:40.067 --> 01:41.625
Daddy?

01:59.486 --> 02:00.976
Help me!

02:03.590 --> 02:06.150
Help me!

02:09.663 --> 02:12.791
Oh, no. No, no, no.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.726
Help me!

02:18.339 --> 02:20.603
Help!

02:41.729 --> 02:43.196
I mean, that really exists?

02:43.364 --> 02:46.162
Thought that was some urban legend.
I didn't think people had that.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.357
I do.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.195
- You're really afraid of clowns.
- Yeah.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.031
What kind of clowns
are we talking about?

02:51.205 --> 02:52.832
Clowns like Deeks? Or clowns like...

02:53.006 --> 02:55.634
No, real clowns.
Orange hair, fat-toed shoes.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.071
We bust in on some terrorists,

02:57.244 --> 02:59.405
they pop on a red nose,
you're gonna freeze up on me?

02:59.880 --> 03:02.280
I reveal a vulnerable part of myself
and you mock me?

03:02.516 --> 03:05.041
- Hell, yeah.
- Well, I have chaetophobia.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.209
Fear of hair?

03:07.421 --> 03:09.912
- Impressive. Gold star for the new girl.
- Way to go, Nell.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.456
I didn't see that in
your Romancing the One profile.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.087
- How did you know that l...?
- I do now.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.387
Go, Deeks.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.198
Well, you'll never find it. It's an alias.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.096
Starting off the relationship
with a lie?

03:22.269 --> 03:23.793
How's that gonna lead to true love?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.265
Are you afraid of all hair?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.035
Back hair.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.738
Shaggy back hair.

03:28.909 --> 03:32.538
On men specifically. It's...
I shouldn't have brought it up.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.443
- You really shouldn't have.
- Got me out of the clown thing.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.244
Oh! Charlene St. James?

03:39.586 --> 03:41.952
Is that your porn star cover?

03:42.189 --> 03:43.747
How did you find that? Don't do this.

03:43.957 --> 03:48.121
Dentures, hoarders,
prison records."

03:48.295 --> 03:50.786
- Setting the bar pretty high there, huh?
- Deeks, st...

03:50.964 --> 03:55.060
Martial arts, techno music,
and first dates at the zoo."

03:55.235 --> 03:57.396
Don't most animals
have hair on their backs?

03:57.604 --> 03:59.401
It's how she faces her fears.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.138
Ladies and gentlemen, make haste.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.271
Let's move it, Charlene.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.972
Commander Jason Rehme
designs and maintains

04:10.150 --> 04:13.677
the cryptographic logons used
by the Department of Naval Personnel

04:13.854 --> 04:15.719
with the highest security clearance.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.413
He's a computer tech.

04:17.624 --> 04:21.024
No, no, I know this guy.
Read all his stuff.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.661
Commander Jason Rehme
literally holds the keys

04:23.831 --> 04:25.591
to the Navy's classified kingdom
in his head.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.701
To call Jason Rehme
a computer tech is to call...

04:28.869 --> 04:30.803
Lady Gaga just a singer.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.338
Still loving the Gaga, huh?

04:38.145 --> 04:40.545
Commander Jason Rehme
is missing.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.547
He had a department meeting
at 0600.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.945
He never showed.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.849
He hasn't answered any calls,
texts or e-mails.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.649
He'd be a prime target
for both domestic

04:50.824 --> 04:52.689
and international terrorists.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.327
So as of 0600,
we are compromised.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.157
He's been missing
for an hour and a half.

04:57.331 --> 05:00.198
Send me his last known whereabouts.
Let's move.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.300
Detective Deeks?

05:04.505 --> 05:06.996
I will always love the Gaga.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.707
Door's locked.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.778
Kensi, Deeks.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.414
Let's go.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.613
NCIS.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.917
No one here.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.457
Still warm. Someone made coffee.

06:00.627 --> 06:03.460
Coffee could have been on a timer.
Bed was slept in.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.359
No sign of a mom living in the house.
He's got a daughter, though.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.125
Amanda, 14.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.962
Guys, I found blood.

06:10.737 --> 06:14.264
No drops. Smearing, like somebody
was dragged towards the woods.

06:14.441 --> 06:16.466
Property backs up
the Angeles National Forest.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.838
Blood starts here.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.480
Found the commander.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.381
It's my daughter's.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.284
I upset her last night.
I went looking for her.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.721
In the woods?

06:34.895 --> 06:37.420
She goes running on the trails
in the morning.

06:37.598 --> 06:41.261
You don't run in flip-flops.
Why didn't you call the cops?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.794
Once you get in the woods,
there's no cell service.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.370
I wanted to find her quickly.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.806
What was your fight about?

06:48.942 --> 06:50.739
She had a boy over.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.277
It was stupid. I made him leave.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.947
The boy's name?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.912
Daniel something.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.745
Daniel Proffer.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.783
Her mom died?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.893
Four years ago.
How did you know that?

07:08.195 --> 07:12.291
Divorcees don't normally have pictures
of their ex all over the house.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.198
I just wanted to tell her I was sorry.

07:17.804 --> 07:20.170
You can tell her when we find her.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.973
The Forest Service
is calling in all the rangers.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.167
They'll start a search.

07:24.848 --> 07:26.406
Daniel, the boyfriend,
was home in bed.

07:26.758 --> 07:28.487
I've got agents heading over
to confirm.

07:30.943 --> 07:32.774
- What is it?
- It says it's from Amanda.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.719
But it's not her e-mail address.
It's a web link to a video.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.151
It's linked to my e-mail.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.993
Oh, God.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.798
- See if Eric can get a trace on this.
- Done.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.639
Oh, no. No.

08:36.081 --> 08:38.572
- FBI Agent Rand, Sam Hanna.
- Hey.

08:38.784 --> 08:41.480
Is the father secure?
He shouldn't see this.

08:41.653 --> 08:43.553
Commander Rehme's
outside with our agents.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.314
Play it.

08:46.992 --> 08:49.688
Three other girls have been kidnapped
and left to die

08:49.862 --> 08:52.194
in boxes buried underground.

08:52.364 --> 08:56.664
Two of the girls' bodies were found,
but one was never recovered.

08:56.835 --> 08:58.359
- I remember this.
- You got this guy.

08:58.570 --> 09:01.061
Yeah, we did. Two years ago.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.730
Lucas Maragos.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.373
He's serving
three consecutive life sentences

09:05.544 --> 09:07.671
at the U.S. Penitentiary at Victorville.

09:08.313 --> 09:12.181
Maragos would send the video
to the parents of the girls.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.842
He got off on torturing their families.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.351
Can you bring our video up here?

09:16.555 --> 09:18.716
The video we got
is a dead ringer for these.

09:19.224 --> 09:22.625
Look at the killer's hands.
Same blue surgical gloves.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.693
Then we have a copycat.

09:26.865 --> 09:28.696
Were these tapes released publicly?

09:29.435 --> 09:33.769
They were used as evidence
during the trial, so there was access.

09:33.939 --> 09:36.271
Or Maragos has a partner.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.205
There was no evidence of a partner.

09:38.877 --> 09:40.276
But I'll go back through the files

09:40.446 --> 09:43.381
and see if any names pop up
in connection with him.

09:48.954 --> 09:50.546
Dickerson.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.622
I need you to hold this match.

09:52.791 --> 09:54.418
Okay.

09:54.793 --> 09:57.125
Don't let it go out.
We only got three left.

09:57.362 --> 10:01.059
I'm going to push the top.
Try to bend it open.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.308
The FBI will take it from here.
Thanks, guys.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.781
Can I talk to you?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.510
Of course.

10:21.987 --> 10:23.852
I don't know these guys.

10:24.022 --> 10:25.284
I'm Navy, born and bred.

10:25.457 --> 10:27.982
I trust NCIS.
Is there a way you can stay on this?

10:28.193 --> 10:29.785
It's no longer our jurisdiction.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.659
I lost my wife.

10:33.832 --> 10:36.300
I can't lose my child. Please.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.361
I understand.
But there's nothing we...

10:39.538 --> 10:41.665
We'll see what we can do.

10:48.614 --> 10:51.014
You wanna tell me
what that was all about?

10:51.183 --> 10:52.775
Sam, talk to me.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.148
- Why did you tell him that?
- Because that's what I'm gonna do.

11:06.131 --> 11:07.792
I want to stay on the abduction case.

11:09.234 --> 11:12.067
It doesn't fall within our purview,
Mr. Hanna.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.328
I think it does.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.640
The guy's a copycat.

11:17.342 --> 11:19.310
Commander Jason Rehme
is the gatekeeper

11:19.478 --> 11:21.878
for all of the Navy's
classified information.

11:22.047 --> 11:24.208
While the FBI is running around
looking for a killer,

11:24.383 --> 11:27.250
the commander could be being
blackmailed into providing access

11:27.452 --> 11:29.181
to top secret information.

11:29.354 --> 11:32.346
That's an interesting theory.

11:33.725 --> 11:35.488
I'm taking a leave of absence.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.685
That's very dramatic.

11:39.898 --> 11:44.597
Sam, please don't
turn your back on me.

11:45.470 --> 11:48.337
I would never do that to you.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.099
Find her.

11:57.916 --> 12:02.182
The Angeles National Forest
is close to 650,000 acres.

12:02.387 --> 12:05.117
If Amanda's buried in there,
finding her is gonna be impossible.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.518
What about infrared off a satellite?

12:07.693 --> 12:09.684
If she's buried,
her body temperature is dropping.

12:09.861 --> 12:11.385
- It's not gonna work.
- What's this?

12:12.731 --> 12:15.291
Equestrian center.
There are horse trails here.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.594
There's a kids' camp here,
only open in the summer.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.271
Can you bring up the video again?

12:20.505 --> 12:21.631
Yeah.

12:21.873 --> 12:25.809
These are three FBI videos
and Amanda's.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.912
The m.o. Is really consistent.

12:29.114 --> 12:31.514
The same camera angle,
same size boxes.

12:31.717 --> 12:33.150
Same blue surgical gloves.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.309
I swear whoever did this
to the first three girls

12:35.520 --> 12:37.078
is the same person
who's got Amanda.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.590
Searching the nearest
surveillance cams,

12:40.759 --> 12:42.920
we got a black '09 Chevy Malibu

12:43.095 --> 12:46.587
possibly headed from the park
at 4:30 a.m.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.892
Can't see the driver.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.328
No plates.
Somebody's hiding something.

12:52.571 --> 12:55.131
It's got a fender bender
on the rear driver's side.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.036
'09 is new.
He'd make an insurance claim.

12:58.243 --> 13:01.269
I got two matches in the L.A. Area.

13:01.913 --> 13:04.074
One,
the insurance photos don't match.

13:04.249 --> 13:06.615
The other looks like our car.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.447
All right,
it's leased to Galea Shipping.

13:09.621 --> 13:12.249
They're a Greek company
that operates out of the Port of L.A.

13:12.457 --> 13:16.052
Oh, this one is assigned
to the president of the company...

13:16.561 --> 13:18.961
What is it?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.361
The president of the company
is Andre Maragos.

13:21.566 --> 13:24.262
He's the brother of Lucas Maragos.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.634
The guy convicted
of the first three murders.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.774
Deeks, can you get out to the
U.S. Penitentiary at Victorville and...

13:29.941 --> 13:32.375
talk to Lucas Maragos,
see if I can make sense of this?

13:32.577 --> 13:33.601
Done.

13:34.112 --> 13:36.205
Now, according to FBI files,

13:36.381 --> 13:39.214
all the boxes were buried
at the same depth,

13:39.818 --> 13:42.150
and the dimensions of the boxes
were exactly the same.

13:42.854 --> 13:45.584
Calculating the remaining oxygen,

13:46.325 --> 13:48.520
Amanda's got
about nine hours to live.

13:53.598 --> 13:56.066
I want a countdown on screen.
Nine hours.

13:56.234 --> 13:58.668
I want it on the big monitors
with her picture.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.202
I want everybody in the office
to see it.

14:18.623 --> 14:21.183
Eric, you get anything off
the security camera?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.055
No go, it's a closed circuit,

14:23.228 --> 14:25.696
and the alarm company
indicates no recorders.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.331
Thanks.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.994
- May I help you?
- Federal agents to see Mr. Maragos.

14:30.168 --> 14:33.001
Kensi, hang back,
then see if you can find the Malibu.

14:37.242 --> 14:39.142
Nice place.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.670
This way, please.

14:46.017 --> 14:47.507
You men are federal agents?

14:47.719 --> 14:50.210
Mr. Maragos,
do you drive a black Malibu?

14:50.722 --> 14:53.418
No. What is this about?

14:53.658 --> 14:55.683
Your company Galea Shipping
leases a Chevy Malibu

14:55.894 --> 14:58.362
that may have been photographed
near the scene of a crime.

14:58.597 --> 15:01.225
My company leases
probably close to 50 cars.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.432
- Go.
- Found the Malibu.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.806
How did you get in here?

15:13.979 --> 15:15.879
The garage was locked
with an alarm.

15:16.047 --> 15:18.572
Oh, my bad, I'm so sorry.
I was looking for the ladies' room.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.615
Teeny, tiny little bladder.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.084
Eric matched the dent. It's the car.

15:23.288 --> 15:25.483
You lied to a federal agent,
Mr. Maragos.

15:26.191 --> 15:27.488
Is this the car Jennifer uses?

15:27.692 --> 15:29.751
Our personal assistant
drives this car.

15:29.928 --> 15:32.624
I'm sorry, I wouldn't know
a Malibu from a Taurus.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.628
I don't think
I've ever even seen this car.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.233
I park mine in the driveway.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.130
Jennifer drives the boys to school,

15:38.336 --> 15:40.770
and my husband leaves the house
before they're even up.

15:40.972 --> 15:42.405
Where was Jennifer last night?

15:42.607 --> 15:44.802
Alaska, backpacking.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.774
Mr. Maragos,
is this you and your brother?

15:49.014 --> 15:50.709
Yes.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.413
Oh, God.

15:54.319 --> 15:55.479
You were in camp together?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.416
He's... He's mentally ill,

15:58.590 --> 16:00.717
but I have no connection
to him whatsoever.

16:00.926 --> 16:03.918
One more time,
were you in camp together?

16:04.129 --> 16:06.597
- Yes.
- Where is this camp located?

16:06.798 --> 16:08.993
The Angeles National Forest.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.804
Exactly where a young girl
was kidnapped this morning.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.764
Is all that jewelry really necessary?

16:44.601 --> 16:46.068
They have trust issues.

16:46.236 --> 16:47.498
You've got ten minutes.

16:48.038 --> 16:51.269
Guy buries three girls in the ground,
I guess it's understandable, right?

16:51.508 --> 16:53.772
Well, they only found two girls.

16:54.011 --> 16:56.275
I'm actually not here
to debate the details of your case.

16:56.513 --> 17:00.973
God is in the details
and so is my freedom.

17:01.785 --> 17:02.911
Another girl was kidnapped.

17:03.087 --> 17:04.281
That's a detail, which means

17:04.521 --> 17:07.512
I may not have to spend
the rest of my life in here.

17:09.526 --> 17:11.255
Was the m.o. The same?

17:12.730 --> 17:14.220
Exactly the same.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.599
You got a partner on the outside?

17:18.769 --> 17:20.566
Oh, no. No, no, no.

17:20.738 --> 17:22.762
- Check my call records, my e-mail.
- I did.

17:23.373 --> 17:26.205
The only phone calls you make
are to your brother Andre.

17:28.746 --> 17:30.543
So is that it?

17:32.116 --> 17:34.744
You and your brother
like killing together?

17:35.753 --> 17:36.913
Yeah?

17:37.087 --> 17:39.419
Bury the girls and then sit there
giggling with each other

17:39.590 --> 17:41.057
while they suffocate to death?

17:43.460 --> 17:45.655
I didn't kill those girls.

17:45.896 --> 17:47.727
- Of course not.
- No.

17:51.335 --> 17:54.395
Is there any evidence at all
that points to my brother?

17:54.605 --> 17:56.266
He could have committed
all these murders.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.271
Interesting,
except for the fact that your DNA

17:58.442 --> 17:59.932
is all over the dead girls' bodies.

18:00.177 --> 18:01.804
We're related.

18:01.979 --> 18:04.140
The DNA's got to be close.

18:04.314 --> 18:06.578
Nobody checked my brother's DNA.

18:09.153 --> 18:12.816
You and your brother went to camp
together in Angeles National Forest.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.787
Remember that?

18:17.194 --> 18:19.355
We think the latest girl
could be buried there.

18:22.566 --> 18:24.932
I help you find her,

18:25.335 --> 18:26.825
you re-open my case.

18:27.070 --> 18:31.006
If you have nothing to do with it?
Sure.

18:38.482 --> 18:40.712
When we were kids at that camp,

18:40.884 --> 18:43.284
there were feral cats
that were all over the place.

18:43.453 --> 18:44.943
Andre? Well,

18:45.122 --> 18:48.888
Andre used to spend hours
catching them and strangling them.

18:49.793 --> 18:52.284
Ah, the golden summers
of a sociopathic youth.

18:53.463 --> 18:56.364
I know where he buried them.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.225
Okay.

19:00.103 --> 19:01.331
Show me.

19:01.538 --> 19:03.335
If my brother
has something to do with this,

19:03.507 --> 19:05.099
I will help you in every way I can.

19:05.609 --> 19:07.634
A 14-year-old girl
is buried alive in a box

19:07.811 --> 19:09.073
and running out of air.

19:09.246 --> 19:11.646
- Does that sound familiar?
- Of course.

19:11.815 --> 19:13.612
But my brother's in prison.

19:13.817 --> 19:15.512
So where were you last night?

19:16.753 --> 19:18.812
At home with my wife.

19:19.022 --> 19:20.717
Really? What were you doing?

19:20.891 --> 19:23.155
I ate, exercised, took a shower...

19:23.360 --> 19:24.588
- Kensi?
- Yeah.

19:24.761 --> 19:27.355
Andre says he was home
with the wife last night.

19:28.131 --> 19:30.122
I'll see what I can do.

19:35.906 --> 19:37.339
Hey.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.771
Just wanted to say sorry
for all of this.

19:39.943 --> 19:41.001
Thank you.

19:41.178 --> 19:42.202
The boys are okay?

19:43.747 --> 19:46.875
If you don't mind me asking,
was your husband home last night?

19:48.218 --> 19:49.845
Yes.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.745
Do you think he could possibly
have anything to do

19:52.923 --> 19:54.550
with Amanda Rehme's
disappearance?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.692
Absolutely not.

19:57.527 --> 19:59.427
He might be a lot of things,

19:59.663 --> 20:02.757
but Andre couldn't do
something like that to a young girl.

20:04.668 --> 20:05.692
I agree.

20:05.869 --> 20:07.700
I don't think he did it,

20:08.472 --> 20:10.736
but I don't think
he was home last night either.

20:12.242 --> 20:14.972
And I bet you'd like to know
where he was.

20:15.812 --> 20:17.973
Was your husband home last night?

20:24.621 --> 20:27.215
Wait, I didn't give you my answer.

20:27.391 --> 20:29.291
Yeah, you did.

20:30.894 --> 20:31.918
Go.

20:32.095 --> 20:34.335
She didn't say it, but Andre
didn't come home last night.

20:34.564 --> 20:36.156
- Got it.
- What did you eat?

20:36.333 --> 20:37.960
I mean, I can't remember.

20:44.641 --> 20:46.131
Your wife just gave you up,

20:47.010 --> 20:49.570
told us you weren't home last night.

20:55.786 --> 20:57.686
I'm sorry, my mistake.

20:57.854 --> 21:00.789
You're right. I was at work all night.

21:01.658 --> 21:05.594
I want a lawyer.

21:05.762 --> 21:06.820
Was anyone else with you?

21:06.997 --> 21:09.261
Conversation over.

21:09.967 --> 21:11.525
Guys.

21:12.302 --> 21:13.360
Andre was at work.

21:13.537 --> 21:15.596
I checked his cell phone,
it was there all night.

21:15.772 --> 21:17.262
- I don't buy it.
- Yeah.

21:17.441 --> 21:18.601
So his phone was in a drawer.

21:18.775 --> 21:20.868
I want witnesses
or camera confirmation.

21:21.044 --> 21:22.204
Okay.

21:22.379 --> 21:24.244
Andre's lawyer
is going before a judge.

21:24.448 --> 21:26.006
He's trying to get
an order of release.

21:26.183 --> 21:29.175
- We can't hold this guy forever.
- Andre is a flight risk.

21:29.353 --> 21:30.377
He's got money.

21:30.554 --> 21:32.317
He may go to a country
with no reciprocity,

21:32.489 --> 21:33.956
and we'd never get him back.

21:34.124 --> 21:35.614
Let's go,
I want everything monitored,

21:35.792 --> 21:37.817
phones, credit cards, everything.

21:48.005 --> 21:49.632
Why are we on this case?

21:50.540 --> 21:53.031
The FBI
is welcoming our assistance.

21:53.276 --> 21:54.641
Hetty.

21:56.079 --> 21:59.810
I respect Sam's privacy, I do,
but I need to know what's going on.

22:27.944 --> 22:29.241
He never said anything.

22:31.314 --> 22:36.843
In our line of work,
we're all haunted by nightmares.

22:37.421 --> 22:40.390
Stay close to your partner.

22:50.901 --> 22:53.028
Andre was at work, but then look.

22:53.236 --> 22:55.636
His phone and car stayed at work.

22:55.839 --> 22:57.136
He took a company car.

22:57.374 --> 22:59.205
But not the black Malibu.

22:59.409 --> 23:01.707
- Eric, I need Sam.
- SATCOMs work in the woods.

23:01.878 --> 23:02.970
That's good news.

23:03.146 --> 23:04.875
- Got Deeks for you.
- Go.

23:05.082 --> 23:06.447
Sam,

23:07.050 --> 23:08.984
you need to get out here now.

23:10.387 --> 23:11.945
Let's go.

23:16.726 --> 23:18.353
Sir.

23:19.463 --> 23:20.657
Any other sites?

23:20.897 --> 23:22.728
You should ask my brother.
These are his.

23:23.767 --> 23:26.759
You seem to be enjoying the attention.
Give me the keys.

23:35.645 --> 23:37.636
Take a walk, man.

23:41.384 --> 23:43.682
Hey. Hey, man.

23:43.887 --> 23:46.378
Where are you taking me?
Where are we going?

23:47.157 --> 23:49.625
You either tell me
where there's another site,

23:49.793 --> 23:51.522
or I tell everyone
how you went for my gun,

23:51.695 --> 23:53.390
and I was forced to defend myself.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.890
Yeah.

23:59.302 --> 24:01.827
Yeah, come to think of it,
there were a few other sites.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.939
Andre used to bury the animals.

24:04.841 --> 24:06.536
- Show me.
- Unh!

24:18.655 --> 24:20.020
That's a box.

24:20.223 --> 24:21.417
- Move, move, move.
- Box.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.490
Get on your knees.

24:28.231 --> 24:29.630
- Come on.
- Stay back.

24:29.833 --> 24:32.028
- Amanda!
- Keep shoveling.

24:33.537 --> 24:35.300
Amanda!

24:44.514 --> 24:47.574
I guess we found your
number three, right, Lucas?

25:09.771 --> 25:12.831
Something tells me there's
not gonna be a lot of brotherly love.

25:13.008 --> 25:14.600
Let's use it to our advantage.

25:14.776 --> 25:16.903
You're destroying my life,
you know that?

25:17.079 --> 25:18.171
I could say the same thing.

25:18.380 --> 25:20.405
I've just spoken
with the federal prosecutor.

25:20.616 --> 25:23.107
If Amanda Rehme is found dead,
buried underground

25:23.285 --> 25:26.118
and suffocated to death, it's gonna
constitute special circumstances.

25:26.321 --> 25:28.186
Why have I been brought here?

25:28.390 --> 25:30.950
Special circumstances
translates to the death penalty.

25:31.126 --> 25:32.957
You're wasting your time with me.

25:33.495 --> 25:36.589
I know your dark side, Andre.
I know what you're capable of.

25:36.798 --> 25:40.393
But this time you can't pin it on me,
because I was in prison.

25:40.602 --> 25:43.093
I've just gotten a court order
to get a DNA sample from you

25:43.305 --> 25:46.206
and compare it to the DNA found
on the bodies of the first three girls.

25:46.408 --> 25:47.466
Swab him.

25:52.914 --> 25:54.541
You sure
you got nothing to say now?

25:55.717 --> 25:59.778
He walks you up to his last victim
and you're looking at me?

25:59.955 --> 26:01.684
He obviously has a partner.

26:01.857 --> 26:03.290
You weren't at work last night.

26:03.925 --> 26:05.552
Where were you?

26:09.531 --> 26:11.294
Open your mouth.

26:15.037 --> 26:17.198
- Which one of them did it?
- We don't know.

26:17.372 --> 26:18.930
Could be neither of them.

26:21.209 --> 26:22.801
How long does my daughter
have to live?

26:22.978 --> 26:24.309
And don't tell me you don't know.

26:25.147 --> 26:27.945
We estimate she has about
six hours of oxygen left.

26:29.451 --> 26:32.249
- Oh, God.
- We're not giving up.

26:35.457 --> 26:36.719
Sam.

26:37.192 --> 26:40.753
Andre's lawyer just showed up.
He's got an order for release.

26:41.263 --> 26:42.321
Stay with the commander.

26:42.497 --> 26:44.192
One moment.

26:44.399 --> 26:48.233
Ms. Rebecca Turman has testified
that she is Mr. Maragos' mistress.

26:48.470 --> 26:49.960
Mr. Maragos was with her last night.

26:50.539 --> 26:53.906
In light of her testimony, the judge
has granted an order of release.

26:54.776 --> 26:56.073
Let's go.

26:56.578 --> 26:58.910
Why did you leave your phone
at work and then switch cars?

26:59.114 --> 27:00.547
Don't answer her.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.240
Because his wife tracks him
on his GPS.

27:03.418 --> 27:05.079
Same with the cell phone.

27:05.253 --> 27:06.413
You just gonna let him go?

27:07.022 --> 27:08.080
We don't have a choice.

27:13.095 --> 27:16.030
- Where are you going?
- To find Amanda.

27:22.270 --> 27:23.532
Keep going?

27:24.039 --> 27:27.099
It's too far from any road
to go any further.

27:28.410 --> 27:30.071
What happened in Bosnia?

27:33.081 --> 27:35.072
You spoke to Hetty?
Then you know.

27:35.784 --> 27:37.046
Okay.

27:42.157 --> 27:46.753
My SEAL team was sent to locate
and capture Serbian war criminals.

27:49.831 --> 27:53.767
Another SEAL,
Bryan Dickerson, was with me.

27:55.937 --> 27:59.134
We were taken to a mass grave
filled with murdered Muslims.

27:59.641 --> 28:03.270
Turned out to be a trap
set by the Serbian paramilitary.

28:05.847 --> 28:06.905
I was beaten.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.448
Bryan was shot.

28:10.986 --> 28:13.784
They didn't wanna kill us
until they interrogated us.

28:13.989 --> 28:17.322
Out in the woods,
there wasn't anywhere to hide us,

28:17.492 --> 28:21.986
so they buried us in a shallow grave

28:22.164 --> 28:24.758
along with the other bodies.

28:26.802 --> 28:28.770
Bryan was bleeding out.

28:28.937 --> 28:30.529
There was nothing I could do.

28:30.705 --> 28:32.639
Try to keep pressure on it, okay?

28:34.576 --> 28:37.773
- What are you doing?
- Trying to get some air.

28:54.796 --> 28:56.696
It's work... It's working a little.

28:56.898 --> 28:58.490
Try to take a breath.

28:58.667 --> 29:01.397
The best thing I can do for you
is die fast.

29:01.636 --> 29:03.126
Try to take a breath.

29:03.705 --> 29:05.536
I save you.

29:06.741 --> 29:09.232
You save someone else.
That's how it's supposed to work.

29:09.477 --> 29:11.138
I said, take a breath.

29:11.346 --> 29:12.904
Sam...

29:13.715 --> 29:16.183
You would do the same for me.

29:16.818 --> 29:19.218
I don't know how much time passed.

29:24.860 --> 29:26.555
I lit the last match.

29:45.580 --> 29:46.842
Glad you told me.

29:49.351 --> 29:51.182
- Guys.
- Go.

29:51.386 --> 29:53.047
I just found a flight plan
out of Burbank.

29:53.221 --> 29:56.384
Andre Maragos
is trying to leave the country.

30:02.898 --> 30:04.229
You tell them to stop.

30:04.399 --> 30:06.390
Air traffic control
has repeatedly told the pilot

30:06.568 --> 30:08.058
not to move toward the runway.

30:10.305 --> 30:11.966
He's just gonna go for it.

30:14.576 --> 30:17.568
Seven-six-five-zero
Sierra Hotel, acknowledge.

30:17.746 --> 30:21.443
You are not cleared to taxi.
You are not cleared to Runway 8.

30:21.683 --> 30:23.173
Stop!

30:24.119 --> 30:26.110
He's not gonna stop!

30:36.998 --> 30:38.898
Shut it down!

30:39.768 --> 30:41.759
Shut it down!

30:51.713 --> 30:54.443
Everybody off the plane now!

31:05.860 --> 31:08.351
I was free to leave the country.

31:08.530 --> 31:11.363
Why did you offer the pilot a million
dollars to get you to Venezuela

31:11.533 --> 31:12.864
after the tower told you to stop?

31:13.034 --> 31:15.628
My lawyer told me
that I was free to leave.

31:15.804 --> 31:19.535
I just wanted to get out of the country
until this was over.

31:19.741 --> 31:22.642
Having a brother like Lucas
has destroyed my family.

31:22.811 --> 31:24.972
I just wanted to get away.

31:25.146 --> 31:27.137
I'm not buying it.

31:27.315 --> 31:28.839
Sam, we've got something.

31:35.490 --> 31:36.980
The FBI double-checked.

31:37.158 --> 31:40.457
All DNA on the dead girls
was a rock-solid match to Lucas.

31:41.262 --> 31:43.162
There's no DNA match to Andre.

31:43.365 --> 31:45.196
We got proof that Andre
was with his mistress,

31:45.367 --> 31:49.565
because they made
a little memento.

31:49.771 --> 31:52.535
Show me what you got. Wow. Ha, ha.

31:52.707 --> 31:53.799
That's all you get.

31:55.844 --> 31:57.209
Could've made this last year.

31:57.846 --> 31:59.507
No. Look.

32:00.181 --> 32:02.172
Where's my wine?

32:03.818 --> 32:07.720
That is a date and time stamp
from the news report from last night.

32:07.889 --> 32:09.083
He was there all night.

32:09.290 --> 32:13.226
Trust me, you do not wanna watch
this whole tape.

32:13.428 --> 32:15.658
Andre was all we had.

32:16.164 --> 32:17.893
It made sense
to keep looking at him.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.667
So we got no suspects,

32:20.835 --> 32:23.269
no idea where Amanda is.

32:23.430 --> 32:25.330
No nothing.

32:39.719 --> 32:41.687
Hey, take a look at this.

32:41.855 --> 32:43.049
When he picked up the camera,

32:43.289 --> 32:46.281
he pulled off the glove,
changed the m.o.

32:46.493 --> 32:47.517
That makes sense.

32:47.694 --> 32:49.685
Glove would've been shredded
from all the digging.

32:49.929 --> 32:51.123
Okay, G, hear me out on this.

32:51.297 --> 32:54.027
What does this guy do
with his gloves afterwards?

32:54.200 --> 32:56.191
Well, first thing,
you would burn them,

32:56.436 --> 32:57.460
shred them.

32:57.637 --> 32:59.537
It's full of DNA.

33:00.006 --> 33:02.668
What if he's going fast, got careless,

33:02.876 --> 33:05.709
left a glove behind,
like in a box or in the dirt in the hole?

33:05.945 --> 33:08.675
Case is closed. I mean, we catch him
the second we find that glove.

33:08.848 --> 33:10.475
But there is no glove.

33:10.650 --> 33:11.981
We don't know that.

33:13.253 --> 33:16.245
Maybe neither does the killer.

33:16.489 --> 33:19.185
He's going fast, he's scared.

33:19.392 --> 33:23.658
He tosses everything,
only to realize he left a glove behind.

33:23.863 --> 33:25.228
Right, but he didn't.

33:25.465 --> 33:27.228
We can make him believe that he did.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.731
- Exactly.
- Nice.

33:28.902 --> 33:30.494
As long as he destroyed the tape.

33:30.670 --> 33:31.864
Well, Lucas did.

33:32.038 --> 33:34.370
Eric, I want you to digitally insert

33:34.541 --> 33:37.203
just a small piece
of blue surgical glove here.

33:37.777 --> 33:40.268
Like it was in the hole
and got covered with dirt.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.677
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Then we show it to Andre and Lucas.

33:43.883 --> 33:46.511
I'm telling you,
this is connected to those two.

33:46.686 --> 33:49.018
We show them that there's a glove
that's been left behind.

33:49.222 --> 33:51.247
I don't know
if it was them or a partner.

33:51.491 --> 33:54.255
Whoever did it's gonna get
scared and go back and get it.

33:54.494 --> 33:56.860
- Then we stake out the park.
- It's a long shot.

33:57.063 --> 34:00.294
- We're gonna need that video fast.
- I'm on it.

34:26.159 --> 34:28.150
You see that little sucker
right there?

34:30.096 --> 34:37.228
It's a glove that got left in the dirt,
and it is filled with DNA.

34:43.243 --> 34:45.768
Is this really necessary?

34:53.620 --> 34:55.952
Whoever's behind this left
that little glove in the dirt.

34:56.121 --> 34:59.057
- It's filled with DNA.
- What's going on?

34:59.259 --> 35:01.250
Go in the other room.

35:01.928 --> 35:05.591
We may not find Amanda alive,
but we will find her eventually.

35:06.332 --> 35:09.790
And when we do,
we'll know exactly who did this.

35:11.104 --> 35:12.696
Sorry to bother you.

35:26.686 --> 35:30.213
Guys, Kensi slipped a GPS
under the bumper of the black Malibu.

35:30.390 --> 35:31.823
It left Andre's house.

35:31.991 --> 35:34.858
Looks like it's headed
towards the western part of the park.

35:35.094 --> 35:36.857
That's us.

35:39.365 --> 35:41.799
The car just headed onto a road
that's not even on a map.

35:43.536 --> 35:44.696
Who knows the park that well?

35:44.871 --> 35:48.967
Rangers, hikers, campers.

35:49.175 --> 35:51.370
What are you thinking, Eric?

35:51.611 --> 35:54.045
Can you find me some photos
from Camp Wild Forest?

35:54.214 --> 35:55.545
Recent photos?

35:58.351 --> 36:00.046
Guys, that Malibu stopped.

36:00.687 --> 36:02.587
- How far, Eric?
- You're closing the distance.

36:02.755 --> 36:04.655
He's half a mile away.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.351
I spent the last two hours
organizing satellite coverage.

36:09.529 --> 36:12.692
It's overflying
and coming on task now.

36:12.899 --> 36:15.231
I've got a heat signature.
He's moving west.

36:15.435 --> 36:17.232
You can't get it clearer than that?

36:17.403 --> 36:19.997
Satellite's still moving into position.

36:22.842 --> 36:25.276
We're at his car.
What have you got?

36:28.748 --> 36:30.875
Eric, what are you seeing?
Is he at the burial site?

36:31.451 --> 36:33.646
We can't move
until he's right on top of it.

36:33.853 --> 36:36.185
He might be stopping. I don't know.

36:36.389 --> 36:38.289
Eric, should we move?

36:43.196 --> 36:45.357
Come on, Eric,
we're running out of time.

36:49.602 --> 36:52.571
Okay, he stopped moving
just a hundred yards west of you. Go.

37:07.587 --> 37:10.420
There are two of them.
They were moving together.

37:24.337 --> 37:26.134
What are we looking for?

37:27.774 --> 37:29.332
- That.
- Of course,

37:29.509 --> 37:31.704
Amanda went to the camp,
it was right near her house.

37:46.125 --> 37:47.353
What?

37:49.162 --> 37:50.925
Where is she?

37:52.098 --> 37:54.999
The boys went to the same
camp as their father and uncle.

37:55.234 --> 37:56.292
They knew Amanda.

37:56.502 --> 37:57.730
They targeted her.

37:57.937 --> 37:59.336
Where is she?

37:59.539 --> 38:01.131
I'll show you.

38:01.341 --> 38:03.241
Get up.

38:11.851 --> 38:13.318
Amanda!

38:44.050 --> 38:47.076
I save you, you save someone else.

38:47.854 --> 38:50.414
That's how it's supposed to work.

38:58.164 --> 39:00.189
Okay, okay. You're safe.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.924
You're safe.

39:18.418 --> 39:20.079
Good job.

39:22.121 --> 39:23.179
Thanks.

39:23.356 --> 39:24.721
Amanda.

39:25.091 --> 39:29.721
I have something
that I want you to have.

39:33.266 --> 39:35.131
It's for good luck.

39:38.538 --> 39:40.233
There's your father.

39:40.406 --> 39:41.703
Amanda.

39:41.874 --> 39:45.401
Daddy. Oh, Daddy.

39:49.549 --> 39:51.039
Are you all right?

39:51.217 --> 39:53.117
I'm okay.

39:55.054 --> 39:56.885
I love you.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.797
Well, all the signs were there.

40:12.972 --> 40:15.133
The string of dead pets
in the neighborhood,

40:15.308 --> 40:18.641
school records
indicating anger issues.

40:19.112 --> 40:21.512
- Boys talk?
- Yeah.

40:21.681 --> 40:24.741
They said they wanted to know
what killing felt like.

40:25.885 --> 40:27.978
Apparently, Uncle Lucas
paid a lot of visits to them

40:28.154 --> 40:29.485
before he went to prison.

40:29.689 --> 40:33.147
Told them
that if they buried the victims alive,

40:33.326 --> 40:34.793
the feeling would last for days.

40:39.132 --> 40:41.157
Wish that was the worst thing
I'd ever known.

40:43.302 --> 40:44.599
You know what really scares me?

40:44.770 --> 40:46.795
You mean, besides clowns?

40:47.406 --> 40:49.203
Losing my partner.

40:52.211 --> 40:54.202
I'd hug it out with you,

40:55.281 --> 40:58.045
but I saw you sit in
some poison oak back in the woods.

41:00.186 --> 41:02.677
I'm trained in wilderness survival, G.

41:02.855 --> 41:04.914
I know what poison oak looks like.

41:10.696 --> 41:11.993
It's on my butt, isn't it?

41:12.498 --> 41:14.966
Yes, it is, Mr. Hanna,

41:15.134 --> 41:20.367
and there's nothing like a good,
thick slathering of calamine.

41:20.573 --> 41:22.370
Remove your pants. I won't look.

41:25.478 --> 41:30.142
I had to do this
for Ollie North in Nicaragua.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.650
Twice.

41:32.818 --> 41:37.187
The man really was an ass.

41:43.396 --> 41:45.387
Mr. Hanna?

41:45.831 --> 41:47.958
Mr. Callen?

41:49.001 --> 41:51.333
Gentlemen?
