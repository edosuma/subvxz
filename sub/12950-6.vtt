00:03.503 --> 00:06.003
<i>My name is Sydney Bristow.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.406
<i>Seven years ago,
I was recruited</i>

00:07.407 --> 00:10.604
<i>by a secret branch of the CIA
called SD-6.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.544
<i>I was sworn to secrecy,</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:14.380
<i>but I couldn't keep it
from my fianc√©.</i>

00:14.381 --> 00:16.782
<i>When the head of SD-6
found out,</i>

00:16.783 --> 00:19.283
<i>he had him killed.</i>

00:19.419 --> 00:20.853
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:20.854 --> 00:22.955
<i>SD-6 is not part of the CIA.</i>

00:22.956 --> 00:24.857
<i>I'd been working
for the very people</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:26.759
<i>I thought
I was fighting against.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.127
<i>So I went to the only place</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.029
<i>that could help me
take them down.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:31.764
<i>Now I'm a double agent
for the CIA,</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
<i>where my handler
is a man named Michael Vaughn.</i>

00:36.569 --> 00:39.004
<i>Only one other person knows
the truth about what I do.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.701
<i>Another double agent
inside SD-6.</i>

00:41.808 --> 00:44.308
<i>Someone I hardly know.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.877
<i>My father.</i>

00:47.180 --> 00:49.680
I know you have a lot
of questions about your father.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.150
I copied his file.

00:51.151 --> 00:54.211
What do you know
about case 332L?

00:54.287 --> 00:57.154
There's some missing pages
in my father's personnel file

00:57.223 --> 00:59.625
and references
to case 332L.

00:59.626 --> 01:00.993
And Agent Calder.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.728
You read that, too.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.229
Calder wasn't CIA.
He was FBI.

01:05.298 --> 01:07.892
Why would the FBI be working
with my father?

01:07.967 --> 01:09.301
They wouldn't.

01:09.302 --> 01:13.398
Unless they suspected him
of selling secrets.

01:13.506 --> 01:15.140
Here's your countermission.

01:15.141 --> 01:17.042
You'll break into the building
as planned.

01:17.043 --> 01:20.274
While Dixon sets the explosives,
you'll retrieve the inhaler

01:20.346 --> 01:21.814
and rendezvous
with the CIA team,

01:21.815 --> 01:23.482
which will already be
inside the building.

01:23.483 --> 01:25.951
By this time, Dixon should've
exited the building.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.420
You'll disable the explosive
while the CIA team

01:28.421 --> 01:30.556
searches the rest of the lab's
main computer system.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.925
Come on.
We got to go.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.792
What are you doing?

01:33.793 --> 01:36.293
I brought
a secondary detonator.

01:37.597 --> 01:40.097
You good to go?

01:46.639 --> 01:48.307
All right. Let's go.

01:48.308 --> 01:52.244
Sydney?
We've got to run!

01:53.513 --> 01:56.013
Sydney,
we've got to move.

01:56.683 --> 01:59.151
Sydney,
we've got to move now!

01:59.152 --> 02:01.086
What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

02:01.087 --> 02:03.122
No.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.623
Let's go.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.627
Run!

02:11.064 --> 02:13.564
Go! Go!

03:21.301 --> 03:24.429
Come on, Sydney.
We got to go.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.471
I couldn't move.

03:26.472 --> 03:30.533
Dixon had to drag me to my feet
just to get to the van.

03:30.643 --> 03:33.271
And when he asked me
what was wrong,

03:33.346 --> 03:36.144
why I had just frozen...

03:36.216 --> 03:39.413
I made up something about
having a flashback to Danny.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.153
You did everything
you could.

03:41.154 --> 03:43.714
I was supposed to stop
the detonation.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.424
I didn't.

03:45.425 --> 03:49.452
And because of that,
four CIA agents were killed.

03:49.529 --> 03:52.726
You had no way of knowing
Dixon had a second trigger.

03:52.799 --> 03:55.529
There was nothing
you could do.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.869
I could've told him
the truth.

03:57.870 --> 04:01.567
Dixon needs to know
who he's really working for.

04:01.641 --> 04:02.241
Sydney.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.643
I know. I can't put
his family at risk.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.211
- Or yourself.
- I know all of that.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.840
But it's the right thing
to do.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.078
Those men died for no reason.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.779
No. Those men died
for their country.

04:24.163 --> 04:26.164
Sydney, I'm sorry.

04:26.165 --> 04:29.066
I'm sorry you had to go
through that.

04:32.905 --> 04:37.137
<i># Still hooked on cellophane #</i>

04:37.210 --> 04:42.648
<i># Hangin' round the mall,
the mall #</i>

04:42.715 --> 04:46.708
<i># Each penny numbs the pain #</i>

04:46.786 --> 04:52.281
<i># Sends you gently

04:52.358 --> 04:56.727
<i># I followed you last night #</i>

04:56.796 --> 05:02.098
<i># I saw you turn
your lights out #</i>

05:02.168 --> 05:05.899
<i># I knew it wasn't right #</i>

05:06.005 --> 05:10.101
<i># I watched in fear and doubt #</i>

05:14.714 --> 05:17.214
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:17.684 --> 05:18.817
You worked late.

05:18.818 --> 05:20.719
Bar association dinner.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.587
One of the lawyers
wanted to sue me

05:22.588 --> 05:24.956
because his chicken
was undercooked.

05:24.957 --> 05:26.958
Can you believe that?

05:26.959 --> 05:29.459
An obnoxious lawyer?

05:32.231 --> 05:34.299
What about
your obnoxious lawyer?

05:34.300 --> 05:35.400
Have you talked to him?

05:35.401 --> 05:37.536
I'm meeting Charlie
for lunch this week.

05:37.537 --> 05:40.037
That's good.

05:42.241 --> 05:44.242
Syd, he's gonna
break up with me.

05:44.243 --> 05:46.743
Did he say that?
He didn't say that.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.080
He didn't have to.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.581
He was sneaking around on me.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.750
We saw him
with that girl Rachel.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.251
There's stuff he's doing
that he can't tell me about?

05:54.287 --> 05:55.687
Please.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.556
I don't think
he'd be meeting with you

05:57.557 --> 05:58.890
just to break up with you.

05:58.891 --> 06:00.192
Guys don't do that.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.390
If they want to end things,
they just vanish, right?

06:05.264 --> 06:07.994
Oh, your mom was so pretty.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.004
Yeah, she was.

06:13.005 --> 06:15.207
Thanks.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.309
I got to go change.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.074
I feel a binge coming on.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.943
Hey.
How was your trip?

06:28.020 --> 06:29.721
Oh.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.384
Um... not good.

06:34.026 --> 06:37.427
I was working
with these people who, um...

06:37.497 --> 06:39.297
They were terminated.

06:39.298 --> 06:41.798
Oh, man.

06:42.301 --> 06:44.801
The economy sucks.

06:47.140 --> 06:51.270
<i># There's nowhere #</i>

06:51.344 --> 06:54.006
<i># To move on #</i>

07:04.690 --> 07:05.891
Hello?

07:05.892 --> 07:08.690
This is Helen Calder.
You left me a message?

07:08.761 --> 07:11.958
Something about my husband
having worked with your father.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.159
I know that your husband
worked for the FBI

07:15.234 --> 07:17.828
and that his job was
to investigate CIA agents

07:17.937 --> 07:20.462
that were suspected
of spying for Russia.

07:20.573 --> 07:25.738
My dad was one of the agents
that your husband investigated.

07:25.812 --> 07:26.845
I know that much.

07:26.846 --> 07:30.680
Did he ever mention
the name Jack Bristow?

07:32.819 --> 07:34.820
I'm sorry.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.915
Bentley didn't talk much
about his work.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.028
He looks kind.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.430
Oh, he is.

07:45.431 --> 07:46.998
I thought Bentley was dead.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.200
Oh, dear, no.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.302
That isn't Bentley.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.602
That's my boyfriend.
Gary.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.085
This is Bentley.

08:10.389 --> 08:12.889
He wasn't so nice.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.728
When did Bentley pass away?

08:22.802 --> 08:26.795
1981.
In a car accident.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.677
Do you have a copy of this?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.679
I think so.

09:50.823 --> 09:53.917
For the last 20 years, I thought
I knew how my mom died.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.194
She and my dad had been out
at the movies.

09:56.195 --> 09:58.330
They were coming home late.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.998
Some postal worker was driving,

09:59.999 --> 10:01.666
coming from
the other direction.

10:01.667 --> 10:03.501
The police said
alcohol wasn't a factor.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.036
This man must've fallen asleep.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.038
His car drifted
over the white line.

10:07.039 --> 10:08.073
My dad swerved.

10:08.074 --> 10:10.208
They went off
the Canyon Creek Bridge.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.143
I always told myself

10:12.144 --> 10:15.375
that my mom didn't have time
to know what was happening.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.885
Now I know that Calder
was hunting down a KGB agent.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.353
My father.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.755
So whatever happened that night
was no accident.

10:23.756 --> 10:25.824
Calder was probably
chasing them.

10:25.825 --> 10:29.261
They probably lost control.
The cars crashed.

10:29.328 --> 10:30.929
Whatever it was,

10:30.930 --> 10:33.398
it brings me back
to the same conclusion.

10:33.399 --> 10:36.300
If my father hadn't been
a double agent...

10:37.436 --> 10:41.896
My mom would still be
alive today.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.777
I'm sorry to lay this on you.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.013
I have no one
to talk to about this.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.781
It's okay.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.583
I want to report him.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.684
What?

10:52.685 --> 10:54.252
I want to turn him in.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.187
For being under suspicion
20 years ago?

10:56.188 --> 10:58.456
- The agency knows that.
- What about the file?

10:58.457 --> 11:01.551
There were pages missing.
Maybe it didn't end.

11:01.627 --> 11:02.861
Maybe he's still working
for Russia.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.529
Stop. Okay? Stop.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.898
What is important
is taking down SD-6.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.667
Your father is helping us
do that.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.802
You're suggesting
that I do nothing.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.904
Not about this.
We have too much work to do.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.340
I wasn't supposed to do
anything about Dixon, either.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.242
Is anything ever
unacceptable to you?

11:18.310 --> 11:20.245
I understand that
we're talking about your dad.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.180
If he did sell
or is selling secrets,

11:22.181 --> 11:23.448
that would be hard.

11:23.449 --> 11:24.716
I hope that would be
hard on you, too.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.418
Before you do anything,
let me find out

11:26.419 --> 11:29.047
if he's under suspicion,
if he's being tracked.

11:29.755 --> 11:32.255
Just give me two days,
all right?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.386
I get it.
You wanted to do it in person.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.864
Instead of coming out with it,

11:39.865 --> 11:42.766
you're making small talk,
which is really pathetic.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.135
Francie...

11:44.136 --> 11:46.504
I have always supported you.
No matter what.

11:46.505 --> 11:49.235
The idea that you would
sneak around behind my back

11:49.341 --> 11:52.139
and lie to me about it
is just the worst part.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.978
Francie...

11:53.979 --> 11:56.479
I want to be a singer.

11:58.984 --> 12:00.452
A singer?

12:00.453 --> 12:04.184
I wasn't going to say anything
until I had everything set up.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.123
That woman? Rachel?
She plays piano.

12:07.193 --> 12:11.425
When you saw us that night,
we were rehearsing.

12:12.364 --> 12:15.492
We have our first gig
this Friday night.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.206
A singer?

12:21.207 --> 12:24.176
Sweetheart, I'm sorry I wasn't
up-front about this before.

12:24.276 --> 12:26.544
Being a lawyer,
it's been my goal.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.279
My family's goal forever.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.781
The thought of me
doing something else

12:29.782 --> 12:31.516
or even wanting to do
something else...

12:31.517 --> 12:34.281
Fran, I've been too afraid
to admit that.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.521
You're not breaking up
with me?

12:36.522 --> 12:39.022
Are you kidding?

12:39.391 --> 12:41.891
You're my baby.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.392
Charlie singing?
I wouldn't miss it.

12:49.468 --> 12:52.130
- Hey, Will.
- Yeah. I'll be there.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.738
Yes. Yes.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.808
Best behavior.
I got it.

12:56.809 --> 12:57.742
Get off my chair.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.778
How's Sydney?
That was Sydney, right?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.346
You got to stop doing that.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.413
Anybody call?

13:02.414 --> 13:04.816
Yep.
A guy from the DMV.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.518
He ran the license plate
you copied

13:06.519 --> 13:07.952
off of Kate Jones' car.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.021
The woman pretending
to be Kate Jones.

13:10.022 --> 13:11.156
According to her
Social Security Number,

13:11.157 --> 13:14.126
the real Kate Jones died
in 1973.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.360
Hello?

13:15.361 --> 13:17.462
Hank.
It's Will.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.497
You come up with anything?

13:19.498 --> 13:20.932
Did that match
the license-plate number

13:20.933 --> 13:24.130
for a 663, Sam, Tango, Frank?

13:24.203 --> 13:26.304
Oh, you're the best.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.540
Okay.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.101
Eloise Kurtz.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.412
Eloise Kurtz is living proof

13:34.413 --> 13:36.247
that someone's covering up
Danny's murder.

13:36.248 --> 13:40.275
She was definitely lying
about having an affair with him.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.387
223 Whitley Place.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.888
Hollywood.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.266
Good work in Germany,
Sydney.

13:55.267 --> 13:57.767
The inhaler prototype's
safely in analysis.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.437
The Badenweiler factory
was demolished

13:59.438 --> 14:01.506
without any casualties.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.207
Thanks.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.708
Dixon deserves the credit,
not me.

14:06.178 --> 14:10.046
Jack will no longer be working
out of Jennings Aerospace.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.416
His assignment there
is complete.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.387
As of today,
he will be working here

14:16.388 --> 14:19.323
with a cover as portfolio
manager for Credit Dauphine.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.454
This way, he can
more actively participate

14:23.529 --> 14:26.293
in the planning
and execution of missions.

14:26.365 --> 14:27.498
Good.

14:27.499 --> 14:29.267
Jack.

14:29.268 --> 14:32.760
Two months ago, FTL vacated
their forward base at Roubaix

14:32.872 --> 14:35.240
and their support station
at Chaniers.

14:35.241 --> 14:38.802
All the heavy equipment
was moved, including the T-47 s.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.971
At the time, recovery team
found this at Roubaix.

14:48.921 --> 14:52.049
Last week we learned
that FTL also abandoned

14:52.124 --> 14:53.958
their transfer facility
at Kenilworth.

14:53.959 --> 14:57.360
A recovery team did a sweep.
They returned with this.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.269
Is the ink encoded?

15:04.270 --> 15:06.770
Uh, that was
my first thought, as well.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.307
Anyway,
you want some fritter?

15:09.308 --> 15:10.475
It's apple.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.277
Analysis studied
the music sample.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.974
They found an identical pattern
of numbers

15:15.047 --> 15:17.215
buried
in the higher frequencies.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.417
It's not noise.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.119
It is where they hid
the code.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.620
- Have we deciphered it?
- No.

15:25.224 --> 15:28.682
Barrage. It's a converted
salvage tug.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.261
FTL uses it
as a floating lab.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.398
Weapon design,
data storage, crypto.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.334
An SD-6 commando team
stormed the ship last night

15:36.402 --> 15:38.836
as it was passing through
the Panama Canal.

15:38.837 --> 15:41.172
They brought back this.

15:41.173 --> 15:42.507
What is it?

15:42.508 --> 15:44.709
FTL's latest code machine.

15:44.710 --> 15:45.843
Without this device,

15:45.844 --> 15:47.979
we're unable to read
any of their communications.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.279
- How does it work?
- Very well.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.385
Uh, we don't know yet.

15:54.386 --> 15:55.720
The team gathered
what they could.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.315
Unfortunately, there was
a self-destruct on the ship.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.416
Needless to say,
they left fairly quickly.

16:01.493 --> 16:02.327
From what they gathered,

16:02.328 --> 16:04.629
only eight decoders
have been produced.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.831
One of them is in
the possession of this man.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.266
John Smythe.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.895
Owner of the Hobbes End
Photo Gallery in London.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.937
He's also an FTL operative.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.498
One of the code machines
is being held at the gallery

16:15.607 --> 16:18.107
awaiting pickup next Tuesday.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.112
You leave for London tonight.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.114
We want to find out
where FTL relocated

16:23.115 --> 16:24.816
and what they're up to.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.411
Your job is to bring back
the encoding machine.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.757
I would have told you
about the realignment,

16:32.758 --> 16:34.826
but you were in Badenweiler.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.126
I heard about what happened.
It's tragic.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.365
I know about you.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.367
That you were hunted
by the FBI.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.394
I know that mom died
because they were after you.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.337
Sydney...

16:46.338 --> 16:49.774
Every time I think I know
just how awful you are,

16:49.875 --> 16:52.375
I learn something worse.

16:59.051 --> 17:03.920
But this time
I'm gonna make sure you pay.

17:34.853 --> 17:35.887
What's this?

17:35.888 --> 17:36.921
A bug.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.357
What are you?
12 years old?

17:39.358 --> 17:41.192
No, a bug.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.461
We didn't know about Smythe.

17:43.462 --> 17:44.362
After we get the code machine,

17:44.363 --> 17:45.997
they'll scan
for listening devices.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.665
The technology
is totally passive.

17:47.666 --> 17:48.800
The guys at Langley

17:48.801 --> 17:50.535
cribbed the design
from a Russian device

17:50.536 --> 17:52.570
they pulled from
the American embassy.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.038
The thing only works
when we hit it

17:54.039 --> 17:56.274
with a microwave beam
off an orbital satellite.

17:56.275 --> 17:59.073
It acts as a microphone.
It's completely undetectable.

17:59.144 --> 18:01.977
If they find it,
they'll just think it's a bug.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.681
Exactly.

18:03.682 --> 18:05.817
What about the code machine?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.618
We won't have time
to pull a switch,

18:07.619 --> 18:09.287
so deliver it to SD-6.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.354
When they break the code,

18:10.355 --> 18:12.824
they'll inform affiliate offices
through the computer network.

18:12.825 --> 18:13.825
Thanks to you,

18:13.826 --> 18:15.893
we're still downloading data
from their mainframe.

18:15.894 --> 18:18.129
How much have you gotten
so far?

18:18.130 --> 18:19.530
Almost 2%.

18:19.531 --> 18:22.125
In all this time,
that's all you got?

18:22.201 --> 18:25.227
If we take too much too quickly,
they'll notice the leak.

18:25.337 --> 18:27.605
If we're patient, we can get
all their internal files.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.607
Then we can do
some real damage.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.108
Good.

18:33.078 --> 18:35.012
Oh, I checked around
about your dad.

18:35.013 --> 18:37.315
He's clean.
No internal investigations.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.583
I told him.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.051
Told him what?

18:40.052 --> 18:41.452
That I know everything.

18:41.453 --> 18:44.183
About Calder, his spying
for the KGB, the accident.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.657
Damn it, I asked you
not to say anything.

18:46.658 --> 18:48.159
I'm sorry,
but I don't care.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.727
If you'd been in my position,
you probably

18:49.728 --> 18:51.629
wouldn't have been able
to control yourself, either.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.764
You're just gonna
have to learn how to do that.

18:53.765 --> 18:56.265
Don't lecture me
about my father.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.801
Because of the spy trade,
my mother is dead.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.838
You couldn't understand
what it's like

19:00.839 --> 19:03.339
to have a parent die that way.

19:10.449 --> 19:13.077
There's a book back at Langley.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.712
They keep it locked up
under glass.

19:15.787 --> 19:19.553
Behind it is a marble wall
with stars carved in it.

19:19.625 --> 19:23.254
It's a memorial to the agents
the company lost in action.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.786
Families are never told
how they died or even where.

19:26.865 --> 19:29.365
Only that they won't be
coming home.

19:31.136 --> 19:35.163
I was 8 when my father
became one of those stars.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.010
At the funerals,
there's a protocol

19:41.046 --> 19:44.015
the agency representative
has to follow.

19:44.082 --> 19:47.142
What to say,
whose hands to shake.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.987
You're admonished.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.582
That is actually the word
they use. Admonished.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.183
Not to be
conspicuously emotional.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.854
Vaughn, I'm so sorry.

19:57.930 --> 20:00.763
The agents that died
at Badenweiler...

20:02.968 --> 20:06.904
I've been assigned to represent
the agency at their funerals.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.621
Delivery.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.750
Got a package
for Eloise Kurtz.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.195
I just need five minutes.

20:31.196 --> 20:32.997
How did you know my name?

20:32.998 --> 20:35.831
- I won't use it.
- I don't know anything.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.068
It's people who say that

20:37.069 --> 20:39.470
that always know much more
than they think they do.

20:39.471 --> 20:41.472
Do you know how they killed
Danny Hecht?

20:41.473 --> 20:43.973
They broke into his apartment
and shot him in his bathtub.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.509
It was three bullets.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.378
It was two here.
One through his heart.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.879
- I'm warning you.
- I just want five minutes.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.315
I have pepper spray.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.184
Ah! Ow! God!

20:53.185 --> 20:54.619
- I told you.
- My eyes!

20:54.620 --> 20:56.587
I warned you.
Now just go away.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.088
Okay!

21:01.927 --> 21:04.427
<i># Come on, Shirl #</i>

21:09.468 --> 21:11.968
<i># Come on, Shirl #</i>

21:15.707 --> 21:18.207
Ready?

21:18.810 --> 21:21.904
It should take me about
20 seconds to get down the hall.

21:25.183 --> 21:27.683
<i># Come on, Shirl #</i>

21:32.858 --> 21:35.358
<i># Come on, Shirl #</i>

22:10.429 --> 22:12.663
Excuse me, sir.
Hello.

22:12.664 --> 22:16.395
Um, actually, this is
a nonsmoking gallery.

22:16.468 --> 22:18.169
Not anymore.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.504
I'm afraid if you don't
put that thing out,

22:20.505 --> 22:23.030
we're gonna have to
escort you to the door.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.377
What kind of a deal
you think I can get

22:26.378 --> 22:31.372
if I take
the entire collection?

22:33.118 --> 22:35.618
I'll go call the owner.

22:54.439 --> 22:55.940
Yeah?

22:55.941 --> 22:58.441
I'll be right there.

23:57.335 --> 24:00.304
Chester Conlan is
an award-winning artist.

24:00.372 --> 24:02.807
It is almost Keeferesque.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.308
I said the same thing.

24:07.813 --> 24:10.313
Is this bothering you,
by the way?

24:10.949 --> 24:13.449
Not at all.

25:05.637 --> 25:08.970
I am tempted,
but I don't know.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.373
Sir, I've already offered
to come down 10%.

25:13.245 --> 25:17.409
10% is not 20%.

26:51.943 --> 26:56.312
I'll eat the tax,
but that is it.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.383
<i>Cherie...</i>

26:59.384 --> 27:02.478
I think I prefer
the Lamborghini.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.580
You are the birthday girl.

27:05.657 --> 27:08.157
Could you do something
with this?

27:20.605 --> 27:23.733
He doesn't sing in the car,
in the shower.

27:23.842 --> 27:25.442
He doesn't even sing
the National Anthem

27:25.443 --> 27:26.477
at baseball games.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.811
He doesn't even hum.

27:27.812 --> 27:31.578
Too "I'm with the band"
kind of...

27:31.650 --> 27:33.684
If he had a good voice,

27:33.685 --> 27:36.347
he would have used it
somewhere. Once.

27:36.421 --> 27:38.921
I would have heard it.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.426
You're gonna be there,
right?

27:42.427 --> 27:44.328
I mean, I need you there.

27:44.329 --> 27:45.963
Of course
I'm gonna be there.

27:45.964 --> 27:48.332
When he's not...

27:48.333 --> 27:52.929
If he's not good,
he's gonna be so devastated.

27:53.038 --> 27:56.007
Or it could be the start
of something great.

27:56.941 --> 27:58.175
Raid my closet.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.777
Thanks.

27:59.778 --> 28:02.278
But I got boobs.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.215
- Hey. I'm Rachel.
- Hi.

28:05.216 --> 28:07.618
Charlie has told me
so much about you.

28:07.619 --> 28:08.485
Really?

28:08.486 --> 28:11.011
Going for her MBA.
Best cook ever.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.290
You're like
this mythic person.

28:13.291 --> 28:14.491
Okay, I like her.

28:14.492 --> 28:16.226
And this is Will.

28:16.227 --> 28:18.328
- You know anything about me?
- No.

28:18.329 --> 28:19.563
- And Sydney.
- Hey.

28:19.564 --> 28:22.294
- This is my sister Amy.
- Hi. How are you?

28:24.602 --> 28:26.503
Will Tippin.

28:26.504 --> 28:27.771
It's Eloise Kurtz.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.969
Sorry. I can't hear you.
Hold on.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.277
This is so exciting.

28:33.278 --> 28:34.778
A little terrifying.

28:34.779 --> 28:36.380
We got to get ready.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.881
You guys are gonna be great.

28:41.686 --> 28:44.054
This is gonna be a disaster.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.555
Stop it.

28:46.825 --> 28:48.659
- Hi.
- Are you all right?

28:48.660 --> 28:50.127
You mean can I see again?

28:50.128 --> 28:51.462
I feel horrible.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.897
It's okay.
I was wearing my glasses.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.532
I'm really not a bad person.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.534
No, I never said
you were a bad person.

28:57.535 --> 28:59.603
You just got to talk to me.
Help me out here.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.438
They gave me $2,000 cash

29:01.439 --> 29:03.939
to say that I was having
an affair with Danny Hecht.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.476
Who gave you the money?

29:05.477 --> 29:07.377
I was between jobs
and my car was broken.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.313
It's still broken,
and anybody in my position

29:09.314 --> 29:10.748
would have done
the same thing.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.217
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
Meet you in person?

29:13.218 --> 29:16.710
Why don't you come by
my apartment tomorrow afternoon?

29:16.788 --> 29:18.689
Yeah, yeah.
How about 3:00?

29:18.690 --> 29:21.420
I have a great car mechanic
if you need one, too.

29:22.861 --> 29:25.361
Hello?

29:26.965 --> 29:27.931
Hello?

29:27.932 --> 29:28.899
Yeah, I'm here.

29:28.900 --> 29:31.425
Listen, everything's
gonna be okay.

29:43.848 --> 29:44.948
How's Francie?

29:44.949 --> 29:47.449
A wreck.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.029
Whoo-hoo! Charlie!
Whoo-hoo!

30:12.143 --> 30:17.046
<i># When the road gets dark #</i>

30:18.183 --> 30:23.314
<i># And you can no longer see #</i>

30:23.388 --> 30:27.688
<i># Just let my love
throw a spark #</i>

30:29.127 --> 30:33.188
<i># And have a little faith
in me #</i>

30:34.399 --> 30:38.768
<i># And when the tears you cry #</i>

30:40.972 --> 30:45.341
<i># Are all you can believe #</i>

30:45.410 --> 30:51.178
<i># Just give these loving arms
a try #</i>

30:51.249 --> 30:55.652
<i># And have a little faith
in me #</i>

30:55.720 --> 31:00.123
<i># And have a little faith
in me #</i>

31:01.593 --> 31:05.359
<i># Have a little faith in me #</i>

31:05.430 --> 31:07.431
That's my boyfriend.

31:07.432 --> 31:11.926
<i># Have a little faith in me #</i>

31:12.871 --> 31:16.739
<i># Have a little faith in me #</i>

31:20.378 --> 31:25.213
<i># When your secret heart #</i>

31:25.283 --> 31:30.619
<i># Cannot speak so easily #</i>

31:31.656 --> 31:34.853
<i># Come here, darling,
from a whisper start #</i>

31:36.761 --> 31:41.289
<i># To have a little faith
in me #</i>

31:41.366 --> 31:45.029
<i># Have a little faith in me #</i>

31:46.738 --> 31:50.936
<i># Have a little faith in me #</i>

31:52.577 --> 31:57.742
<i># Have a little faith in me #</i>

31:57.815 --> 32:02.149
<i># Have a little faith in me #</i>

32:03.621 --> 32:05.589
It tickles.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.757
What just happened?

32:06.758 --> 32:09.784
It took a piece of your thumb.
A speck. A cell.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.662
Then this is true genius.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.257
It created a code
based on your DNA.

32:14.332 --> 32:17.062
That's how the code from
those greeting cards worked.

32:17.135 --> 32:18.568
The encryption was DNA-based.

32:18.569 --> 32:19.136
Whose?

32:19.137 --> 32:21.338
We know he was the recipient
of one of the cards.

32:21.339 --> 32:24.638
Gareth Parkishoff. Leader
of the FTL Cell in Rabat.

32:24.709 --> 32:27.576
That's the good news.
We know it's Parkishoff.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.780
The bad news is that
Parkishoff is dead.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.249
We need a sample of his DNA.
We don't know where he's buried.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.750
Marshall?

32:35.920 --> 32:36.987
Marshall?

32:36.988 --> 32:39.323
The system's a little sluggish.

32:39.324 --> 32:41.824
Marshall, get Fisher.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.595
Last month, we received Intel

32:45.596 --> 32:48.497
that Parkishoff was assassinated
by Martin Shepard.

32:48.566 --> 32:51.228
Shepard's an interesting case.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.396
His subconscious was programmed
to respond to a simple phrase.

32:54.505 --> 32:57.133
Say it to him, and he'd do
whatever you asked, even kill.

32:57.241 --> 32:58.809
Say it again,

32:58.810 --> 33:01.310
and those acts would be erased
from his conscious mind.

33:01.312 --> 33:03.812
He'd have no recollection
of the acts he'd committed.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.251
Now, we have known for some time
what that phrase is.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.919
- It's by John Donne.
- Right.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.188
We want you to get close
to Shepard, recite the poem,

33:11.189 --> 33:14.556
and get him to tell you
where Parkishoff is buried.

33:14.625 --> 33:15.993
Where is he?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.328
Shepard checked himself
into a mental institution

33:18.329 --> 33:20.829
in Bucharest,
Southern Romania.

33:20.898 --> 33:23.000
Uh, if you don't mind...

33:23.001 --> 33:25.501
There's something
kind of weird going on

33:25.503 --> 33:27.270
with the computer network.

33:27.271 --> 33:29.439
Marshall...

33:29.440 --> 33:31.274
Kind of a bandwidth leak.

33:31.275 --> 33:34.472
Why don't you get me a report
by the end of the day?

33:35.279 --> 33:37.681
Agent Fisher will be
your support on this one.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.182
His alias is
Dr. Carlos Fontanetta.

33:40.184 --> 33:42.052
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

33:42.053 --> 33:45.147
The Mangalov Clinic is
expecting Dr. Fontanetta

33:45.223 --> 33:48.317
to check a patient in
the day after tomorrow.

33:48.393 --> 33:50.893
You are that patient.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.864
If your handler is unavailable,
once you've located Parkishoff,

34:00.972 --> 34:02.239
you are to relay
the coordinates...

34:02.240 --> 34:03.707
Vaughn's at a funeral.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.542
Four heroes who died
because of people like you.

34:05.543 --> 34:07.411
You are to relay the correct
coordinates to SD-6.

34:07.412 --> 34:08.879
Once they have
decoded the message...

34:08.880 --> 34:10.213
Go to hell.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.714
People's lives are at stake.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.250
Your life.

34:15.953 --> 34:18.453
What you think you know,
you don't know.

34:19.556 --> 34:22.056
Then you explain it to me.

34:24.661 --> 34:26.129
You don't have clearance.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.364
- Clearance?
- Yes.

34:27.364 --> 34:29.266
To be told
how my mother died?

34:29.266 --> 34:30.534
There are rules, Sydney.

34:30.534 --> 34:31.802
Then you break them.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.937
Think about what you're saying.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.532
Acting cavalier
about breaking the rules.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.507
Think about the last time
you did something like that.

34:41.846 --> 34:44.781
I'm not a perfect man.
I know that.

34:44.849 --> 34:46.116
But I am smart enough

34:46.117 --> 34:49.177
not to draw simple conclusions
and then act upon them.

34:50.554 --> 34:52.722
I would think if anyone
had learned that lesson,

34:52.723 --> 34:55.223
it would have been you.

35:18.549 --> 35:22.041
Miss Dicamila is bipolar.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.681
We were doing some
relief work up in the North

35:25.756 --> 35:28.623
when she suffered
a psychotic break.

35:29.727 --> 35:33.356
She's suffering
from auditory hallucinations.

35:33.431 --> 35:36.867
She thinks that her government
wants to kill her.

35:41.839 --> 35:43.974
Her previous doctor
submitted her

35:43.975 --> 35:46.443
for some rather
experimental treatments.

35:46.444 --> 35:49.811
Lithium substitutes,
neurolinguistic reprogramming.

35:49.881 --> 35:52.611
All of which had no effect
on her condition.

35:52.683 --> 35:55.118
I'm still trying to find
her parents,

35:55.119 --> 35:58.282
but until then,
I need a place for her.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.257
Is she taking
any antipsychotics?

36:00.258 --> 36:03.284
Olanzapine,
20 milligrams, QPM.

36:07.198 --> 36:09.698
Shh. Shh.

36:18.543 --> 36:21.273
There are other
institutions in Bucharest.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.845
How is it you honor us?

36:24.515 --> 36:28.451
The Consulate.
They directed me here.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.356
This way.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.857
We'll get her admitted.

36:53.077 --> 36:55.577
Miss Kurtz?

37:00.084 --> 37:03.247
I'm coming in.
Easy on the pepper spray.

37:58.542 --> 38:03.241
<i># Be still, my soul #</i>

38:03.314 --> 38:08.684
<i># The Lord is on thy side #</i>

38:10.588 --> 38:14.922
<i># Stand calm within #</i>

38:14.992 --> 38:20.862
<i># The storm of grief and pain #</i>

38:22.199 --> 38:27.364
<i># Trust in thy God #</i>

38:27.471 --> 38:33.239
<i># To order and provide #</i>

38:33.311 --> 38:38.408
<i># Through every change #</i>

38:38.482 --> 38:45.251
<i># His faithful light remains #</i>

38:45.323 --> 38:50.260
<i># Be still, my soul #</i>

38:50.328 --> 38:55.595
<i># The restful peace within #</i>

38:55.666 --> 38:57.667
Your dad was a hero.

38:57.668 --> 39:01.195
<i># Through trying times #</i>

39:01.305 --> 39:06.368
<i># Eternally #</i>

39:06.477 --> 39:11.210
<i># In love #</i>

39:15.953 --> 39:18.453
Oh, no.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.792
Oh, no.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.464
That leak.
The glitch.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.666
There's a worm.
There's a hacker in our network.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.261
They're downloading
all the files off the server!

39:32.370 --> 39:34.870
Got to cut the hard line.

39:47.752 --> 39:51.313
Hello, Alain?
We need to meet.

39:52.089 --> 39:54.589
I think we have a mole.

40:25.055 --> 40:27.555
Hi.

40:29.126 --> 40:31.594
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Not a problem.

40:31.595 --> 40:35.622
Two more forms,
and her admission is complete.

40:41.772 --> 40:46.232
While you were waiting,
I called the Consulate.

40:46.343 --> 40:49.801
I am speaking at the
U.N. Conference on refugees

40:49.914 --> 40:51.281
in New York next month.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.782
I called them about a visa.

40:54.785 --> 40:56.252
Naturally, I thanked them

40:56.253 --> 40:59.279
for having recommended
our institution.

40:59.356 --> 41:02.985
I was surprised to hear
that they were unaware

41:03.060 --> 41:05.560
of any such recommendation.

41:10.234 --> 41:14.728
Do I... know you?

41:17.775 --> 41:22.109
No man is an island,
entire of itself.

41:22.179 --> 41:24.943
Every man is a piece
of the continent...

41:29.019 --> 41:31.519
Who are you?

41:36.460 --> 41:39.293
Who are you? Huh?

41:39.363 --> 41:41.097
Yes, that is because
the Consulate

41:41.098 --> 41:43.166
referred me to the local
health department.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.834
They made a recommendation.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.736
Well, that explains it.

42:13.130 --> 42:15.630
We know what you're doing,
Miss Bristow.

42:30.581 --> 42:31.948
Hey, where's Vaughn?

42:31.949 --> 42:34.474
He's covering the funerals.
Badenweiler.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.052
Why?
You finally get a date?

42:36.053 --> 42:38.254
You know that assignment
Bristow's been sent to?

42:38.255 --> 42:40.256
The doctor who's running
the place? Kreshnik?

42:40.257 --> 42:42.757
He's with K-Directorate.

43:39.850 --> 43:42.350
Fisher?

43:43.305 --> 43:49.680
