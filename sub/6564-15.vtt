01:48.270 --> 01:51.550
Everybody, everybody,get out on the floor

01:51.730 --> 01:55.260
It can get a little crazy when the kick hits the floor

01:55.460 --> 01:58.920
Make a scene, make a scene, nobody can ignore

01:59.290 --> 02:02.880
Don't knock it. We can't take it no more

02:03.440 --> 02:06.610
Bring the lights up,bust the doors down

02:07.170 --> 02:10.289
Dust yourself off  Shake it up, shake it up

02:10.550 --> 02:14.370
DJ set it off,take it up a notch

02:14.770 --> 02:17.830
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

02:18.830 --> 02:22.370
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up. You got to change it up

02:22.720 --> 02:26.260
And when you've had enough. Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

02:26.510 --> 02:29.300
Bring the lights up,bust the doors down

02:29.590 --> 02:32.850
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

02:35.370 --> 02:37.420
Shake it up

02:37.420 --> 02:38.880
Shake It Up!  S02E15  Judge It Up

02:43.530 --> 02:44.720
What a lousy day.

02:44.950 --> 02:46.680
First a surprise Spanish test

02:47.140 --> 02:48.700
and now here come the Hessenheffers.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.100
If you think about it

02:51.100 --> 02:53.450
there is actually a lot to like about Gunther and Tinka

02:55.820 --> 02:57.570
There is? Like what?

02:58.030 --> 03:00.530
Well, like... They owe us money!

03:03.860 --> 03:05.830
I believe you have something for us.

03:05.930 --> 03:06.990
Disrespect?

03:07.170 --> 03:08.140
Disdain?

03:08.140 --> 03:11.540
This feeling in my throat to yak up a yak?

03:12.910 --> 03:14.560
No. We're talking about the money you owe us

03:14.560 --> 03:16.860
for performing at your cousin's party yesterday

03:17.070 --> 03:21.200
Yes. And this time we want cash not sequins.,

03:22.370 --> 03:24.460
You don't deserve to be paid.

03:24.870 --> 03:27.040
You were late, though that's not unusual,

03:27.680 --> 03:30.010
poorly dressed, though that's not unusual,

03:30.390 --> 03:32.170
and your dancing was terrible.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.460
Even more so than usual.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.000
Plus, you made our poor little Klaus cry

03:38.000 --> 03:39.640
and ruined his birthday cake

03:40.350 --> 03:41.750
That's not true!

03:41.910 --> 03:44.220
And even if it was, you still have to pay us.

03:44.540 --> 03:46.330
We have a verbal contract.

03:46.770 --> 03:48.370
So sue us!

03:49.520 --> 03:51.110
You know what? We will sue you!

03:51.990 --> 03:53.650
On what grounds?

03:54.030 --> 03:56.790
Right here on the grounds of Chicago. Duh.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.140
Yeah.

04:21.490 --> 04:25.090
This cheesy bread is both my wildest dream and my darkest nightmare¡£

04:26.510 --> 04:27.960
Hello, my poorly mannered friend,

04:28.110 --> 04:30.880
who clearly hasn't mastered the fine art of using utensils.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.390
Yeah, hi, Henry.

04:32.930 --> 04:35.090
Would you make yourself useful and please cut the cheese?

04:38.040 --> 04:39.060
"Cut the cheese."

04:44.140 --> 04:46.630
So, my parents just got me a new bicycle

04:46.880 --> 04:49.450
as a gift for winning the MacArthur Genius Grant

04:49.900 --> 04:52.020
for my work on the molecular physiology...

04:53.070 --> 04:54.060
I won a nerd prize.

04:54.840 --> 04:55.510
Oh, cool.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.270
So, let's go celebrate

04:57.410 --> 05:00.230
by propelling our pedal driven recreational vehicles together.

05:02.030 --> 05:03.300
Go bike riding.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.740
Oh. Sorry, I can't.

05:07.270 --> 05:09.880
I, uh, pulled a tenderloin yesterday

05:10.190 --> 05:14.160
and I should...rest it?

05:15.900 --> 05:18.040
Yeah. Flynn, spill it.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.010
Fine. I don't know how to ride a bike.

05:20.730 --> 05:22.190
You don't know how to ride a bike?

05:23.390 --> 05:25.080
I don't know what else to say other than...

05:25.580 --> 05:26.900
I can do a kid thing you can't!

05:27.080 --> 05:28.630
I can do a kid thing you can't!

05:28.940 --> 05:30.450
You know what? I don't care, Henry.

05:30.610 --> 05:32.460
Because I have no interest in bike riding.

05:32.950 --> 05:36.010
See, my plan is to go straight from skateboarding to driving a car.

05:36.490 --> 05:39.240
But learning to ride a bike is like a rite of passage.

05:39.510 --> 05:41.760
Like getting your first mechanical pencil,

05:42.120 --> 05:44.120
or discovering your first subatomic particle,

05:44.460 --> 05:45.810
or wearing big boy pants.

05:47.540 --> 05:48.490
Congratulations, Henry.

05:48.660 --> 05:50.060
You've made me want to learn how to ride a bike...

05:50.660 --> 05:51.570
- ...even less.  - aww.

05:52.530 --> 05:53.830
And you no longer have to cut the cheese.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.520
I just did it myself.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.040
So I called the courthouse about suing Gunther and Tinka,

06:04.340 --> 06:06.120
and they said it's going to take months to get a court date.

06:06.820 --> 06:09.040
Rocky, everyone knows

06:09.240 --> 06:12.340
that when you want justice you do not go to the government.

06:12.810 --> 06:16.070
You go to the one place where everyone gets a fair chance...

06:16.890 --> 06:18.070
Television!

06:20.130 --> 06:22.730
CeCe, there's so much wrong with what you just said,

06:23.250 --> 06:24.680
that I don't even know where to start.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.940
Start by clearing your schedule next Saturday,

06:28.160 --> 06:30.890
because I got us on Teen Court.

06:31.590 --> 06:32.390
Awesome, right?

06:32.730 --> 06:33.870
Awesome, not at all.

06:34.980 --> 06:36.700
CeCe, this is about getting our day in court,

06:36.940 --> 06:38.070
not about getting on TV.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.540
Besides, all those shows are fake,

06:39.760 --> 06:41.660
made-up cases with actors following scripts.

06:42.100 --> 06:42.790
Oh, really?

06:44.610 --> 06:48.200
All cases on Teen Court are real and unscripted.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.200
Participants are not actors

06:50.360 --> 06:53.060
and agree that all decisions reached by Judge Marsha Sanders

06:53.210 --> 06:55.830
are final and binding in accordance with

06:55.930 --> 06:59.800
Judicial Code Article 7, subsection 23,paragraph 2-J.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.120
Really? You can remember all of that,

07:05.260 --> 07:07.920
but you can't remember what year "Columbus sailed the ocean blue"?

07:09.380 --> 07:11.840
I knew it rhymed, I just thought it was 1982.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.600
I'll get it, Mom!

07:28.910 --> 07:30.920
What super hero are you? The Incredible Nerd

07:32.040 --> 07:34.190
This might be the endorphins talking,

07:34.340 --> 07:35.690
but stuff it, Flynn!

07:38.330 --> 07:40.470
I just had the bike ride of my life.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.940
I started on Cherry Lane,

07:42.150 --> 07:44.150
pedaled all the way up Drexel Boulevard

07:44.460 --> 07:45.890
and then headed down Madison.

07:46.270 --> 07:47.890
So, you went around the block?

07:49.730 --> 07:51.530
And you know what that block tasted like?

07:51.840 --> 07:52.920
Freedom!

07:53.210 --> 07:56.400
Because with a bicycle, I can go wherever I want, whenever I want.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.280
As long as you don't cross any streets

07:58.440 --> 07:59.780
and get your dad's permission first?

08:00.520 --> 08:01.440
Obviously.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.200
Save it, Henry. I really don't want to learn to ride a bike.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.960
It just seems like an unnecessary skill to me.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.500
Ice cream man!

08:15.780 --> 08:17.040
We'll never catch him!

08:17.650 --> 08:21.460
Hmm. If only there was a way for kids to get places

08:21.620 --> 08:23.610
faster than walking or running.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.490
Oh, wait, there is.

08:34.090 --> 08:35.919
Welcome to <i>Teen Court.</i>

08:36.130 --> 08:36.919
Today's case:

08:37.110 --> 08:40.840
The Birthday Boogie Blow-Up Bonanza.

08:40.970 --> 08:44.550
These are the Plaintiffs, CeCe Jones and Rocky Blue.

08:44.940 --> 08:47.450
They claim they enteredt with the defendants

08:47.570 --> 08:49.820
to perform a super awesome dance.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.980
They say after going above and beyond fabulous,

08:53.090 --> 08:54.400
they were never compensated.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.440
They're suing for $80 for services performed,

08:57.650 --> 09:00.880
plus one million dollars for emotional distress.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.190
These are the Defendants.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.930
He is Gunther. She is Tinka.

09:08.230 --> 09:12.510
And they are the Hessenheffers.

09:13.340 --> 09:16.020
They claim that instead of putting on a super awesome dance,

09:16.300 --> 09:18.380
the plaintiffs stunk the place up

09:18.550 --> 09:20.030
with their super lame moves.

09:20.370 --> 09:22.580
Since the plaintiffs didn't fulfill their contracts,

09:22.780 --> 09:24.290
they shouldn't be paid.

09:26.030 --> 09:29.520
Now, all rise for the Honorable

09:29.690 --> 09:31.900
and, dare I say, very attractive,

09:32.090 --> 09:35.440
Judge Marsha Sanders.

09:44.510 --> 09:48.110
Ooh! Judge Marsha! You're the coolest judge on TV.

09:48.410 --> 09:50.120
I'll be the judge of that!

09:54.360 --> 09:57.400
Rocky and CeCe, first off, you can't sue for a million dollars.

09:57.590 --> 09:59.530
This is small claims court,

09:59.780 --> 10:02.150
the maximum is ten thousand.

10:02.650 --> 10:04.600
Besides, you can't fill a pitcher with lemonade,

10:04.790 --> 10:06.300
if you've only got one lime.

10:07.770 --> 10:10.020
What is that supposed to mean?

10:10.430 --> 10:13.640
It means, I'm the only one getting the big bucks on this show.

10:16.270 --> 10:19.430
Okay, now on to the case at hand.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.310
Tell me how this all got started.

10:21.730 --> 10:22.890
Well...

10:23.430 --> 10:26.150
It all started when we met in ballet class...

10:28.130 --> 10:30.300
Not that far back, Ms. Jones.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.560
I've got two more cases after you

10:32.820 --> 10:35.960
and tickets to Twelve Angry Men on Iceat 5:00.

10:36.150 --> 10:37.880
I've got no time for nonsense.

10:38.870 --> 10:40.070
I'll be the judge of that.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.870
That's my catch phrase, Blondie. Get your own.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.330
Sorry, baby.

10:47.010 --> 10:47.940
Now move on.

10:48.500 --> 10:52.960
Okay, well, here's how it all started.

10:54.290 --> 10:57.940
Well, if it isn't Stinky and the Brain.

10:59.710 --> 11:03.320
Okay, losers, we need you and your four left feet

11:03.470 --> 11:05.570
to dance at our cousin's birthday party this Saturday.

11:06.020 --> 11:08.150
We can't do it because we are too busy hosting.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.300
And being delusional egomaniacs.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.340
We'd be happy to help,

11:13.510 --> 11:16.150
as we are kind people who care about others more than ourselves,

11:16.380 --> 11:19.310
but, sorry, we're rescuing blind puppies that day.

11:20.490 --> 11:21.920
And then we're going to donate blood

11:22.050 --> 11:24.030
to needy, bloodless people.

11:27.310 --> 11:28.310
Well, too bad!

11:28.560 --> 11:30.420
You're going to need your blood, sweat and tears

11:30.540 --> 11:31.910
for all the dancing you're going to be doing.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.410
We'll pay you $80.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.540
You'll do it, and you'll like it!

11:40.810 --> 11:43.390
Your Honor, if we knew this was "Liar's Court"

11:43.530 --> 11:46.410
we would have started by telling CeCe how cute her bangs are.

11:48.020 --> 11:49.570
Aww, thanks, Tinka.

11:50.150 --> 11:51.620
Hey!

11:53.030 --> 11:54.750
Here's how it really happened.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.570
I do not believe the dancers for Klaus's party cannot make it.

12:01.630 --> 12:03.830
Wait! We were just eavesdropping like always

12:03.990 --> 12:06.720
since there's nothing interesting ever happening in our own lives,

12:07.710 --> 12:08.920
we heard you need dancers?

12:09.740 --> 12:13.600
Yes, but on such short notice we won't be able to find replacements.

12:14.030 --> 12:15.800
Let us dance at the party!

12:16.230 --> 12:17.960
I mean, we know we're not as good as you guys.

12:18.130 --> 12:21.640
In fact, we're the worst dancers on <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

12:23.090 --> 12:24.490
She means all of Chicago.

12:25.170 --> 12:28.270
But the practice would do us some good.

12:28.940 --> 12:31.670
Please? Please? Please?

12:31.830 --> 12:35.110
Oh. Okay. But only because, as everyone knows,

12:35.230 --> 12:37.600
we are generous, good-hearted people.

12:38.930 --> 12:42.330
Puh-lease! The only thing you said that was true

12:42.460 --> 12:43.660
was that it happened at school!

12:43.940 --> 12:45.260
And that my bangs are cute.

12:47.190 --> 12:50.240
This is what happens when you put a kitten and canary

12:50.440 --> 12:52.280
in the same paper bag

12:52.430 --> 12:54.310
and tell them to bake a pie.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.110
Which means what exactly?

12:59.740 --> 13:02.090
It means I had coffee and a bran muffin

13:02.270 --> 13:04.600
and something is brewing.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.790
I call recess.

13:18.150 --> 13:21.360
Judge Marsha is off the throne and back on the bench,

13:22.220 --> 13:23.290
as we return to the case

13:23.440 --> 13:26.380
of the Birthday Boogie Blow-Up Bonanza.

13:26.870 --> 13:28.720
Teen Court is back in session.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.800
I'll be the judge of that!

13:32.240 --> 13:33.420
It never gets old.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.210
Let's hope not, baby.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.950
Now, let's move on to the events of the party.

13:40.230 --> 13:42.670
I'll take this one, CeCe. All right.

13:42.950 --> 13:45.290
We were at Crusty's about to take the stage...

13:45.970 --> 13:48.410
...and, Klaus, for your special day,

13:48.560 --> 13:51.400
we hired the best entertainment in the city.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.180
But they canceled on us at the last moment.

13:54.910 --> 13:57.500
So let's give a small smattering of patronizing applause

13:57.720 --> 13:59.030
for CeCe and Rocky.

14:40.490 --> 14:41.840
What was that?

14:42.010 --> 14:44.950
We asked for dancing, not a vicious assault on our eyes

14:45.110 --> 14:46.140
set to music!

14:46.490 --> 14:48.240
What...What are you talking about?

14:48.440 --> 14:50.150
We worked really hard on that. Klaus loved it.

14:50.580 --> 14:52.950
She's right. I think they are awesome.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.070
Oh, what do you know, Klaus?

14:55.290 --> 14:56.470
You are only a child.

14:56.910 --> 15:00.260
Here, have some cake.

15:04.230 --> 15:08.530
My party is ruined! My party is ruined!

15:11.330 --> 15:13.270
Interesting story, girls,

15:13.690 --> 15:15.580
but just because you hand me ice skates,

15:15.730 --> 15:18.060
doesn't mean we're having snow cones for dessert.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.460
I don't know what that means.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.950
It means, there's another side to the story,

15:27.120 --> 15:28.200
and I want to hear it.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.320
Why just hear about it when I can recreate it

15:30.460 --> 15:32.290
through interpretive dance?

15:32.580 --> 15:34.330
Can it, Sparkles.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.580
You're up, Hair Bun!

15:37.100 --> 15:40.320
Well, we were all set for a lovely party

15:40.690 --> 15:42.670
until they arrived...

15:43.660 --> 15:45.600
And now, dear cousin Klaus,

15:45.800 --> 15:49.280
the surprise that is the cornerstone to your party.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.290
It will make your already joyful experience

15:51.420 --> 15:53.090
a true wonder for all to behold.

15:56.100 --> 15:56.810
All right.

15:57.780 --> 16:01.340
Well, this is an unexpected development.

16:01.940 --> 16:05.020
Okay, Let's dance for these ugly little pinheads.

16:28.460 --> 16:29.660
All right, pay us.

16:30.460 --> 16:31.610
Well, that was abrupt.

16:33.270 --> 16:36.210
It wasn't your greatest dance but you tried your best.

16:36.550 --> 16:39.910
It's true. We see the best in people

16:40.020 --> 16:42.060
and would never criticize anyone.

16:42.810 --> 16:45.420
Let alone you two lovely ladies.

16:46.190 --> 16:48.340
Cake! Out of our way, you monsters.

16:54.990 --> 16:59.190
My party is ruined! My party is ruined!

17:00.910 --> 17:02.500
Who cares?

17:03.050 --> 17:05.960
I hate kids and the America Judicial System!

17:06.380 --> 17:06.990
Cake!

17:07.990 --> 17:09.819
How dare you!

17:10.430 --> 17:13.430
Your Honor, I object! I would never hurt a child!

17:13.780 --> 17:16.099
And I love the American Judicial System.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.099
Don't come into my house

17:18.230 --> 17:21.089
and tell me that the sewer is in the attic.

17:22.430 --> 17:24.099
Yeah, I don't follow your meaning.

17:24.329 --> 17:27.119
It means I've heard enough

17:27.270 --> 17:30.070
and I'm going to my chamber to think it over.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.290
Come on, Flynn.

17:36.440 --> 17:38.380
Everyone has to learn at some point.

17:38.550 --> 17:40.240
You have no reason to be embarrassed.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.660
Really, Henry? No reason? None at all?

17:45.350 --> 17:47.930
Okay, I can tell you're a little nervous.

17:48.100 --> 17:49.660
So, let's talk about your fears.

17:50.060 --> 17:53.220
Well, I've done a lot of soul searching, Henry,

17:53.350 --> 17:54.990
and basically I've realized...

17:55.230 --> 17:56.640
I don't want to tip over!

17:57.460 --> 17:59.660
See, I have these things in my body that I really like.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.900
Yeah, they're called bones.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.510
Okay. Relax.

18:03.670 --> 18:06.240
I'll just throw on some training wheels and we'll get started.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.810
Training wheels? Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.060
I'm Flynn Jones.

18:10.310 --> 18:12.420
Flynn Jones did not use sippy cups.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.110
Flynn Jones did not use bumpers for bowling.

18:15.250 --> 18:17.110
Flynn Jones never had a potty seat,

18:17.310 --> 18:18.440
he went straight  to the toi-toi!

18:18.610 --> 18:21.770
And Flynn Jones will not be using training wheels.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.450
Now step aside,  Professor.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.000
Don't just stand there, get the training wheels.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.550
In all my years on the bench,

18:38.880 --> 18:41.110
I have never heard such totally different versions

18:41.260 --> 18:42.560
of the same story.

18:42.740 --> 18:46.440
After a lot of reflection, and a foot rub from my boo,

18:48.170 --> 18:50.430
I rule in favor of...

18:50.900 --> 18:52.050
Your Honor, wait!

18:52.180 --> 18:54.410
There's still one more super-secret surprise witness!

18:55.760 --> 18:56.270
Me!

18:58.990 --> 18:59.970
Order in the court!

19:00.330 --> 19:01.390
What is the meaning of this?

19:01.700 --> 19:05.650
Well, to be honest, I thought we were losing,

19:05.870 --> 19:06.810
so I called Deuce

19:06.970 --> 19:09.110
and asked him to bring the surveillance footage from that day.

19:09.530 --> 19:10.920
And this sweaty young man is...

19:11.080 --> 19:13.700
Deuce Martinez, Your Honor, and for the record...

19:13.910 --> 19:17.200
I throw myself on the mercy of the court!

19:17.420 --> 19:18.570
You're out of order!

19:18.900 --> 19:21.290
You can't handle the truth!

19:22.530 --> 19:25.120
I'm sorry. My mom's right, I watch way too much TV.

19:26.710 --> 19:28.530
Anyhoo, I work at Crusty's,

19:28.660 --> 19:30.920
where the alleged party took place,

19:31.250 --> 19:33.820
and I think this will clear everything up.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.110
I'll be the judge of that!

19:40.070 --> 19:42.500
Now, don't put a Maypole up in my living room

19:42.620 --> 19:44.100
and tell me it's spring break.

19:44.690 --> 19:47.130
What the heck does that mean?

19:47.380 --> 19:49.680
Isn't it obvious? She wants me to play the footage.

19:51.010 --> 19:54.310
Finally, someone around here understands me.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.970
I like you, Eyebrow.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.450
Right back at you, Judge.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.860
Okay. You did really good with the training wheels,

20:04.990 --> 20:06.690
but now it's time for the real thing.

20:06.970 --> 20:09.250
- You've got me, right?  - I've got you.

20:09.380 --> 20:10.910
You're not going to let go, right?

20:11.080 --> 20:11.930
I won't let go.

20:12.220 --> 20:14.710
- Hey, Flynn?  - Yeah?

20:14.880 --> 20:17.180
I let go. You're doing it all on your own!

20:17.390 --> 20:19.990
You lied to me? What kind of friend are you?

20:20.190 --> 20:22.320
Hey, wait a minute. I'm riding on my own?

20:22.490 --> 20:25.070
This is so awesome! And way easier than I thought.

20:25.220 --> 20:26.640
Thanks for teaching me, Henry.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.730
You're the best.

20:29.420 --> 20:30.850
Your kind words are appreciated, Flynn.

20:31.010 --> 20:32.380
But if you really want to thank me,

20:32.560 --> 20:34.810
- say it with a gift card.   - All right.

20:36.010 --> 20:36.810
Hey!

20:37.450 --> 20:40.350
Did you rig the bike so I wouldn't fall? Was it all a lie?

20:40.590 --> 20:44.040
Hey, we can stand here all day and argue about this

20:44.210 --> 20:46.190
- or we can run.   - What do you mean?

20:46.320 --> 20:48.820
The bike! It's heading toward us!  Run!

21:06.400 --> 21:09.020
I've never seen you look more beautiful than you do right now.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.090
Nobody saw that. Nobody saw tt.

21:13.210 --> 21:14.360
Fast forward, fast forward!

21:19.580 --> 21:21.760
See, our costumes look nice.

21:22.220 --> 21:24.260
Well, maybe I got that part wrong.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.200
Okay, I guess we could have rehearsed a little more.

21:37.390 --> 21:39.040
Where were the flips and tricks?

21:39.210 --> 21:40.670
I knew we shouldn't have hired them.

21:40.960 --> 21:41.990
Is it cake time?

21:42.130 --> 21:43.190
Not now, Klaus!

21:44.460 --> 21:46.860
What? You never said anything about flips and tricks.

21:47.020 --> 21:48.450
I knew we shouldn't have taken this job.

21:48.660 --> 21:50.030
Please, don't argue.

21:50.160 --> 21:51.250
Can't we eat cake?

21:51.440 --> 21:53.070
Not now, Klaus!

21:56.460 --> 22:00.070
My party is ruined! My party is ruined!

22:03.530 --> 22:06.070
Sorry, guys, it was our fault.

22:06.430 --> 22:09.180
No, it was obviously all our fault.

22:09.350 --> 22:11.360
Yes, like the hairdresser who cuts your bangs,

22:11.590 --> 22:12.820
we must take the blame.

22:13.070 --> 22:16.450
No, it was our fault!

22:16.690 --> 22:18.260
No, it was our fault!

22:21.430 --> 22:23.310
All right! I'll be the judge of that!

22:24.710 --> 22:26.810
It's your fault. And your fault.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.750
In fact, it's all your fault!

22:29.530 --> 22:30.550
Case dismissed!

22:31.630 --> 22:33.940
Not so fast, Your Honor!

22:35.010 --> 22:36.360
This is Klaus Hessenheffer.

22:36.510 --> 22:41.240
He claims his party was ruined. His party was ruined.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.150
He's suing for one million dollars and a new cake.

22:46.450 --> 22:47.750
It was their fault!

22:48.010 --> 22:49.420
No, it was their fault!

22:51.000 --> 22:52.830
Case dismissed.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.590
Hey, where's Deuce?

22:58.770 --> 23:00.060
Oh, he's home sick.

23:00.930 --> 23:01.950
Apparently that mop

23:02.140 --> 23:04.520
had been seeing the bathroom floor behind his back.

23:07.350 --> 23:09.540
I know the judge dismissed your case,

23:09.690 --> 23:11.390
but Gunther and I talked about it

23:11.500 --> 23:14.480
and we feel really bad about everything that happened.

23:15.010 --> 23:17.170
It's okay. No hard feelings.

23:17.640 --> 23:21.660
Yes, well anyway, we hired you and feel you deserve to be paid.

23:23.110 --> 23:26.470
Oh. Wow, that's really nice, Tinka. Thank you.

23:27.550 --> 23:28.820
Gunther!

23:28.820 --> 23:29.820
I think it's about right, but you probably want to counter it.

23:29.820 --> 23:30.820
We don't want a lawsuit.
