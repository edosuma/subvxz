00:02.212 --> 00:04.389
This programme
contains some scenes...

00:04.434 --> 00:06.839
which some viewers
may find upsetting.

00:06.884 --> 00:08.845
The ABC railway guide was
beside both dead women.

00:08.890 --> 00:10.935
It is the killer telling
us the rules of the game.

00:10.980 --> 00:12.535
Mr Cust, is there something
you want?

00:12.580 --> 00:13.943
The success of my enterprise.

00:13.988 --> 00:16.076
Would you mind if I joined you,
Sir Carmichael?

00:16.120 --> 00:18.236
Not at all,
but it is quite wild out there.

00:18.281 --> 00:19.831
Whore!

00:19.876 --> 00:23.095
Have I caused you some offence?
You're not who you say you are.

00:23.140 --> 00:31.140
Who the hell are you?

00:46.052 --> 00:51.895
Mon nom est Hercule Poirot.

00:51.940 --> 00:59.940
Je suis un refugie.

01:01.732 --> 01:04.694
Are you joining family
who are already here,

01:04.739 --> 01:10.263
or are family, wife and children
joining you later?

01:10.308 --> 01:13.556
Non.

01:13.601 --> 01:16.919
Do you need a doctor?

01:16.964 --> 01:19.556
Non.

01:19.601 --> 01:24.855
And what is your profession?

01:24.900 --> 01:27.031
GLASS SMASHES

01:27.076 --> 01:32.343
Are you all right, madam?

01:32.388 --> 01:33.623
Gendarme.

01:33.668 --> 01:41.668
TRAIN WHISTLE

02:28.900 --> 02:31.223
Where's the letter from ABC?
You have what I have.

02:31.268 --> 02:33.335
The Inspector isn't going
to want all these.

02:33.380 --> 02:36.727
I have no wish for them either.
Take them.

02:36.772 --> 02:38.396
What are you so twitchy for?

02:38.441 --> 02:41.036
You'd better not be doing your
own thing. Crome won't like that.

02:41.081 --> 02:44.663
You have ransacked my home and
removed my personal possessions.

02:44.708 --> 02:49.783
"Twitchy" is the appropriate
response.

02:49.828 --> 02:51.716
All right if I use your
lavvy before I go?

02:51.761 --> 02:57.079
No, it's not all right.

02:57.124 --> 03:05.124
Don't do yourself any favours,
do you?

03:10.121 --> 03:18.121
DOOR OPENS

03:53.188 --> 04:01.188
SOBBING

04:06.372 --> 04:11.191
Sir Carmichael?

04:11.236 --> 04:15.031
How disgraceful of me,
what an appalling show,

04:15.076 --> 04:20.755
I'm so sorry...
There's nothing to be sorry for.

04:20.801 --> 04:28.801
You are such a
comfort to me, Thora.

04:38.692 --> 04:43.255
What the hell are you doing?!

04:43.300 --> 04:46.519
I was just trying to be kind.
I love my wife.

04:46.564 --> 04:48.684
How can you live here all
this time and not know that?

04:48.729 --> 04:50.167
You've misunderstood me, I...

04:50.212 --> 04:57.335
I give you a week to find another
job and somewhere else to live.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.767
Consider this your formal
notice of dismissal.

04:59.812 --> 05:02.036
Sir, I...

05:02.081 --> 05:07.127
Lady Hermione's asking for
you, Sir. Thank you, Capstick.

05:07.172 --> 05:15.172
You have plenty of work to be
getting on with, Miss Grey.

05:15.812 --> 05:18.007
"Miss Grey" is it now?

05:18.052 --> 05:25.559
Someone's fallen off her pedestal.

05:25.604 --> 05:29.079
Piss off!

05:29.124 --> 05:37.124
I've got my eye on you, girl.

06:04.004 --> 06:12.004
Come on, just a short stroll.
Stretch the legs.

06:12.388 --> 06:20.215
OWL HOOTS

06:20.260 --> 06:28.260
Come on, Wilbur. You're supposed to
be going for a walk. Go on! Go on!

06:36.401 --> 06:40.631
WILBUR YAPS AND GROWLS

06:40.676 --> 06:48.375
What's the matter with you?
Silly old thing!

06:48.420 --> 06:50.516
WILBUR WHIMPERS

06:50.561 --> 06:54.327
THUD!

06:54.372 --> 07:02.372
LABOURED BREATHING

07:10.180 --> 07:18.180
THUD!

07:18.761 --> 07:24.599
KNOCK AT DOOR

07:24.644 --> 07:29.783
It's Mrs Kirkham
from across the hall.

07:29.828 --> 07:32.023
It's my daily woman's fault.

07:32.068 --> 07:35.351
I honestly don't think she can
read. She just puts everything on

07:35.396 --> 07:38.551
the mantelpiece, whether
it's for me, or for someone else.

07:38.596 --> 07:42.199
She's incorrigibly stupid,
but very good at dusting.

07:42.244 --> 07:47.383
Madame, we are neighbours, yet you
come to my door wearing that?

07:47.428 --> 07:51.031
Oh...Oh, but it's not you
we object to.

07:51.076 --> 07:54.807
It's all the others.
The ones that breed like flies.

07:54.852 --> 07:57.303
How may I assist you?

07:57.348 --> 07:59.636
Well, like I say, my daily's fault.

07:59.681 --> 08:04.023
I only just saw it.

08:04.068 --> 08:12.068
Incredibly rude.

08:22.948 --> 08:30.948
TICKING

08:39.203 --> 08:41.783
Operator.Churston.
Combeside is the house.

08:41.828 --> 08:44.023
The name is Clarke. Hurry!

08:44.068 --> 08:52.068
PHONE RINGS

08:54.641 --> 08:57.847
Churston 966.
Is this Combeside?It is.

08:57.892 --> 09:00.023
Is Sir Carmichael safe?

09:00.068 --> 09:02.135
Who is this?
What are you talking about?

09:02.180 --> 09:06.487
It is Hercule Poirot.
Somebody means him great harm.

09:06.532 --> 09:08.156
Harm? Why?

09:08.201 --> 09:10.391
Because his name is
Carmichael Clarke.

09:10.436 --> 09:12.596
Who is it, Franklin?

09:12.641 --> 09:14.999
Darling, can you ask Car
to come to the telephone?

09:15.044 --> 09:18.007
He took Wilbur for his walk.

09:18.052 --> 09:21.911
When?Oh, I don't know,
I was... I was dozing.

09:21.956 --> 09:27.287
What is it?

09:27.332 --> 09:30.039
Car?

09:30.084 --> 09:35.927
WILBUR BARKS Car?

09:35.972 --> 09:43.972
Car?

09:54.340 --> 09:57.687
WILBUR YAPS

09:57.732 --> 10:00.823
Yes, there we are...

10:00.868 --> 10:06.647
I was in the bath.
Is there something wrong?

10:06.692 --> 10:08.887
Sir Carmichael?
I have to call the police.

10:08.932 --> 10:11.127
I'm sorry,
I have to call them right now.

10:11.172 --> 10:19.172
PHONE PIPS

10:24.420 --> 10:28.215
Terror grips nation.Thank you.
Terror grips nation.

10:28.260 --> 10:30.903
Terror grips nation.

10:30.948 --> 10:34.487
RADIO: 200 extra police constables
will be patrolling the streets.

10:34.532 --> 10:36.599
But our question for the
commissioner of the.

10:36.644 --> 10:38.839
Metropolitan police force is

10:38.884 --> 10:41.996
is this substantial enough in
the face of terror that ABC

10:42.041 --> 10:44.756
is wreaking across the country?

10:44.801 --> 10:48.759
Inspector Crome of Scotland Yard
was unable to comment.

10:48.804 --> 10:54.476
The question on everyone's mind
is where will ABC strike next?

10:54.521 --> 10:58.679
Who and where is D?
And we are concerned,

10:58.724 --> 11:06.724
that this government is not...

11:07.044 --> 11:15.044
Is my breakfast not
good enough for you?

11:25.988 --> 11:27.287
I'm sorry?

11:27.332 --> 11:35.332
I said, is my breakfast
not good enough for you?

11:41.220 --> 11:49.220
It looks delicious.

12:04.601 --> 12:12.601
Chin-chin.

12:20.452 --> 12:28.452
HE RETCHES

12:30.948 --> 12:34.743
You think the killer wanted
to get me? Why?

12:34.788 --> 12:39.031
He is, and pardon me
for being so blunt,

12:39.076 --> 12:43.916
a deranged sexual pervert.
His victims are women.

12:43.961 --> 12:46.135
Ascher. Barnard...

12:46.180 --> 12:48.759
But my surname is Grey.

12:48.804 --> 12:55.287
Perhaps he thought it was Crey
and mistook Sir Carmichael for you.

12:55.332 --> 12:59.703
What about Capstick? Maybe
the killer wanted to get her.

12:59.748 --> 13:04.076
Inspector, how could anyone, even
in the grip of depraved lunacy,

13:04.121 --> 13:09.175
mistake my brother
for Miss Grey or Capstick?

13:09.220 --> 13:16.663
Did any of you see any strangers,
anything or anyone unusual?

13:16.708 --> 13:20.503
Poirot was here.

13:20.548 --> 13:23.319
I saw him.

13:23.364 --> 13:26.967
Poirot.No, Hermione, darling,
that was a long time ago.

13:27.012 --> 13:29.463
Was it? Really?

13:29.508 --> 13:31.447
Oh, of course!

13:31.492 --> 13:34.391
Yes! Mes enfants!

13:34.436 --> 13:37.676
That's right.
And what a party it was, eh?

13:37.721 --> 13:40.796
I've been having the most
terrible dreams.

13:40.841 --> 13:44.439
All right. Let's get you back
to bed, angel. Come on.

13:44.484 --> 13:47.831
Is Car coming home soon?

13:47.876 --> 13:52.375
Come on.

13:52.420 --> 14:00.420
Come on.

14:00.740 --> 14:06.967
I'll get an officer
to take your statements.

14:07.012 --> 14:15.012
Isn't it time you
packed, Miss Grey?

14:25.124 --> 14:30.007
Corpus Christi.Amen.

14:30.052 --> 14:36.855
Corpus Christi.Amen.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.695
Corpus Christi.Amen.

14:40.740 --> 14:43.127
Corpus Christi.Amen.

14:43.172 --> 14:48.836
Corpus Christi. Corpus Christi.
Amen.

14:48.881 --> 14:52.471
Je vous saue Marie.
Pleine de grace.

14:52.516 --> 14:56.439
Ils arrivent!
Le Seigneur est avec vous.

14:56.484 --> 14:58.743
Ils arrivent!

14:58.788 --> 15:04.247
Sainte Marie, mere de Dieu.

15:04.292 --> 15:12.292
GUNSHOT AND SCREAMS

15:16.132 --> 15:21.236
Corpus Christi.

15:21.281 --> 15:24.116
Corpus Christi.

15:24.161 --> 15:26.135
How come you never told the police?

15:26.180 --> 15:28.887
How come you let that man
and those women be killed?

15:28.932 --> 15:30.836
I did not let them be killed.

15:30.881 --> 15:33.921
Well, that's what it says here.
Where is he going to strike next? MOB SHOUTS.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.543
My dad died in Belgium.

15:35.588 --> 15:38.935
Private Eric Beddows of the
King's Infantry, blown to bits in

15:38.980 --> 15:46.980
your shitty country that you
couldn't even stay and fight for!

15:51.652 --> 15:57.303
Your neighbour told me
where you'd be.

15:57.348 --> 16:00.055
Go.

16:00.100 --> 16:08.100
What are you hiding
from the police?!

16:13.540 --> 16:16.951
I'm sad, Lily.

16:16.996 --> 16:19.255
No-one loves me.

16:19.300 --> 16:27.300
You don't love me and I
take care of you, don't I?

16:27.940 --> 16:33.015
Will you sing me a song
because I'm sad?

16:33.060 --> 16:36.535
Day and night

16:36.580 --> 16:39.735
Why is it so

16:39.780 --> 16:46.839
That this longing for you
follows wherever I go?

16:46.884 --> 16:50.935
In the roaring traffic's boom

16:50.980 --> 16:55.556
In the silence of my lonely room

16:55.601 --> 16:58.556
I think of you

16:58.601 --> 17:01.303
Night and day

17:01.348 --> 17:05.719
Day and night

17:05.763 --> 17:13.763
Deep in the heart of me.

17:32.388 --> 17:36.183
I wish I had been able to
alert you sooner.

17:36.228 --> 17:38.103
Your brother would be alive.

17:38.148 --> 17:40.855
But I was not enough.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.095
I don't hold you responsible.
Far from it.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.143
How is Lady Hermione?

17:45.188 --> 17:46.359
She's very frail.

17:46.404 --> 17:49.495
I wouldn't have left her if this
wasn't so important.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.695
What is your opinion of
Inspector Crome?

17:52.740 --> 17:55.916
I am not familiar with his
methodology.

17:55.961 --> 17:59.351
Ah, well,
I'm not convinced he's got one.

17:59.396 --> 18:04.407
But you do, though.
So what do YOU think?

18:04.452 --> 18:07.676
There is a connection between
Bexhill and Churston,

18:07.721 --> 18:12.279
because I've visited both places,
but I've never been to Andover, so

18:12.324 --> 18:16.567
perhaps the connection
is mere coincidence.

18:16.612 --> 18:18.836
Crome doesn't ask questions.

18:18.881 --> 18:21.367
I need you to ask the questions.

18:21.412 --> 18:24.375
I don't think the Inspector
would appreciate that.

18:24.420 --> 18:28.023
Car's head was nearly taken
right off his neck.

18:28.068 --> 18:31.169
My brother, who
never thought or did

18:31.214 --> 18:34.103
a petty, cruel
thing in his life.

18:34.148 --> 18:36.407
So I don't care what the
Inspector appreciates,

18:36.452 --> 18:38.327
I want this bloody man stopped.

18:38.372 --> 18:41.527
What makes you think it's a man?

18:41.572 --> 18:44.279
LETTERBOX CLATTERS

18:44.324 --> 18:52.324
Excusez-moi.

19:10.564 --> 19:18.564
"Mon Cher Hercule, are you having
fun yet? What's next..."

19:21.281 --> 19:24.279
You ask the questions...

19:24.324 --> 19:32.324
and I will pay for your time.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.719
Come in.

19:53.764 --> 19:57.815
You've met Miss Megan Barnard,
I believe.Mademoiselle.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.695
And Donald Fraser.Monsieur.
And Mrs Barnard isn't coping

20:00.740 --> 20:04.087
particularly well,
so best left in peace.

20:04.132 --> 20:07.735
And of course, poor Mrs Ascher's
husband is in prison.

20:07.780 --> 20:11.063
Thora is just getting dressed.

20:11.108 --> 20:14.647
Ah.

20:14.692 --> 20:18.116
We've had something of a fracas at
Combeside.

20:18.161 --> 20:19.703
Some of the maids have it
in for Thora.

20:19.748 --> 20:24.503
It's just jealousy, I expect,
but I've taken this room for her.

20:24.548 --> 20:32.548
It's been a horrible shock
for the poor girl.

20:32.740 --> 20:40.247
Thora?

20:40.292 --> 20:45.815
Ah.

20:45.860 --> 20:53.860
You remember Miss Grey.
Mademoiselle Grey.

21:02.441 --> 21:07.383
Franklin says you don't think
the killer is a man. Why not?

21:07.428 --> 21:11.287
There is a layer of artifice
in the letters,

21:11.332 --> 21:14.999
as if a woman were writing to give
the impression of being a man,

21:15.044 --> 21:18.967
or vice versa.Betty would never
have gone off with another man.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.636
Never.

21:20.681 --> 21:23.831
So Miss Barnard went to a beach hut
and took her stockings off

21:23.876 --> 21:25.687
for another girl?

21:25.732 --> 21:28.076
I never thought Bexhill
quite so... racy.

21:28.121 --> 21:31.255
Christ! Betty wouldn't have gone
off with anyone! She loved me!

21:31.300 --> 21:33.687
We were in love!Mes enfants,

21:33.732 --> 21:37.719
if we are to discover the killer,
we must be honest about the nature

21:37.764 --> 21:40.796
and proclivities of the victims.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.095
Who the hell are you
calling a child? I'm not a child!

21:43.140 --> 21:44.996
I'm not some boy to be patronised!
Please, Mr

21:45.041 --> 21:47.063
Fraser, it's just something
that Mr Poirot says.

21:47.108 --> 21:49.815
"Mes enfants," he's known for it.
He means nothing insulting by it.

21:49.860 --> 21:55.575
Well, I am insulted!

21:55.620 --> 21:58.199
We were told you were going to ask
us questions,

21:58.244 --> 22:01.796
so get on and ask them.

22:01.841 --> 22:06.135
Searching your memories, did any of
you notice anything peculiar

22:06.180 --> 22:09.143
in the lead-up to the murders?

22:09.188 --> 22:17.188
No strangers? Nothing different in
the behaviour of the victims?

22:19.812 --> 22:23.415
No, nothing strange.
Nothing different.

22:23.460 --> 22:26.679
Mr Fraser?Er, no. Nothing
different. Nothing unusual.

22:26.724 --> 22:28.521
Is that it? Because
the police asked

22:28.566 --> 22:30.356
exactly the same
question, so we've

22:30.401 --> 22:33.015
come all this way for nothing.
I feel sorry for you, Mr Clarke.

22:33.060 --> 22:38.903
You've wasted your money,
I've wasted my time!

22:38.948 --> 22:46.948
He... He's upset.

22:47.268 --> 22:54.135
That went well.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.415
Donald, wait.

22:55.460 --> 22:58.615
Mademoiselle, can you tell me what
sort of person your sister

22:58.660 --> 23:02.455
might have met at the beach hut
in the middle of the night?

23:02.500 --> 23:04.567
Wasn't the kind of thing
we discussed.

23:04.612 --> 23:07.895
Could you tell me what stockings
your sister wore?

23:07.940 --> 23:15.940
No.

23:36.292 --> 23:42.263
HE GASPS

23:42.308 --> 23:50.308
HE SOBS

24:01.380 --> 24:09.380
HE MOANS AND CHOKES

24:38.372 --> 24:46.372
FLIES BUZZ

24:48.740 --> 24:56.740
BELL RINGS

25:00.900 --> 25:08.900
FLIES BUZZ

26:42.468 --> 26:50.468
BABY CRIES

27:04.612 --> 27:08.036
So, despite what I said, despite me
telling you point-blank to

27:08.081 --> 27:12.695
stay out of this,
Clarke's got you on the payroll.

27:12.740 --> 27:14.743
I did not withhold
information from you.

27:14.788 --> 27:19.607
Do not tell lies about me to make
yourself more popular.

27:19.652 --> 27:22.231
I didn't say a bloody thing!
They make up what they want,

27:22.276 --> 27:26.775
they always do.Because of this,
I have been spat at in the street!

27:26.820 --> 27:29.276
Well, I've been spat at, too!
Happens to coppers.

27:29.321 --> 27:32.876
Oh. So now I am a policeman?
A "copper", even. How gratifying.

27:32.921 --> 27:34.715
Don't twist my words!
And never mind what it says about you...

27:34.760 --> 27:36.596
look what they say about me!

27:36.641 --> 27:39.476
I can't find my arse with both
hands!That is not what it says.

27:39.521 --> 27:43.927
Well, it might as well do.

27:43.972 --> 27:48.236
What the hell?!Madame Ascher
was wearing new stockings.

27:48.281 --> 27:52.375
Betty Barnard was strangled with
the same make of stockings.

27:52.420 --> 27:55.767
And Carmichael Clarke was a secret
stocking-wearer, was he?

27:55.812 --> 27:58.391
Had ladies scanties on under
his tweed suit?

27:58.436 --> 28:01.676
Keep that one out of the papers.

28:01.721 --> 28:06.263
I think this is what is left of
the packet the stockings came in.

28:06.308 --> 28:08.759
We need to identify it.

28:08.804 --> 28:12.791
"We", and you "think"?
It's a scrap of paper.

28:12.836 --> 28:16.503
You have people, you must
put them on it immediately.

28:16.548 --> 28:19.916
First off, you don't give me
orders. And second, yeah,

28:19.961 --> 28:23.351
I do have people - top people -
but they're a bit busy working on

28:23.396 --> 28:25.399
the letters to chase after
a scrap of paper -

28:25.444 --> 28:27.959
they're trying to break the code,
because there must be a code.

28:28.004 --> 28:30.071
There is a code.

28:30.116 --> 28:34.167
The code is me.What?!

28:34.212 --> 28:38.583
I'm having a brandy,
do you want one?

28:38.628 --> 28:40.183
You're offering me a drink?

28:40.228 --> 28:42.039
Despite what I may think,

28:42.084 --> 28:45.716
Japp said you were a good man,
so I am offering you a brandy.

28:45.761 --> 28:50.103
Do you want one? Yes or no?

28:50.148 --> 28:56.503
Japp said that?

28:56.548 --> 29:00.727
The code is you?

29:00.772 --> 29:03.415
Chin-chin.

29:03.460 --> 29:06.236
In 1921,

29:06.281 --> 29:09.116
I had a cream tea

29:09.161 --> 29:11.095
at The Ginger Cat

29:11.140 --> 29:13.783
in Bexhill where, years later,
Betty Barnard

29:13.828 --> 29:15.895
was to become a waitress.

29:15.940 --> 29:19.927
In 1928, I attended Lady Hermione's

29:19.972 --> 29:22.295
birthday party in Combeside.

29:22.340 --> 29:26.967
I know. She kept talking about you,
said you'd been there.

29:27.012 --> 29:29.783
Poor lady couldn't even remember
her husband had died.

29:29.828 --> 29:33.047
But Andover doesn't
fit the pattern.

29:33.092 --> 29:37.719
I found this in Madame Ascher's
shop.

29:37.764 --> 29:39.383
It was framed.

29:39.428 --> 29:42.967
She'd kept it since 1914.

29:43.012 --> 29:45.975
It was precious to her.

29:46.020 --> 29:49.687
You took evidence from a crime
scene? What is wrong with you?

29:49.732 --> 29:53.399
Read it.

29:53.444 --> 29:56.663
"A train carrying refugees from
Belgium was held at a siding,

29:56.708 --> 29:59.996
"waiting for a driver. One of
the passengers got tired of the

30:00.041 --> 30:02.359
"long delay and his mother
went into labour.

30:02.404 --> 30:05.175
"Luckily for mother and baby,
Mrs Alice Ascher, who owns a nearby

30:05.220 --> 30:07.799
"tobacconists, was able to
offer the newborn boy a full

30:07.844 --> 30:09.596
"wardrobe of bootees and shawls."

30:09.641 --> 30:15.095
It's very sweet, but what's it
got to do with you?

30:15.140 --> 30:18.167
"The baby was delivered by another
passenger on the train,

30:18.212 --> 30:22.007
"one M Hercule Poirot...

30:22.052 --> 30:23.927
"before continuing on his journey."

30:23.972 --> 30:26.636
But I didn't know it was Andover.

30:26.681 --> 30:31.159
The night was dark, and no-one
thought to mention where we were.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.783
This baby will be 19 by now.

30:33.828 --> 30:39.287
What was the mother's name?Marie.
Her surname.I didn't even ask.

30:39.332 --> 30:42.487
It wasn't important at the time.

30:42.532 --> 30:44.343
This baby could be our man.

30:44.388 --> 30:46.583
What if it isn't a man
writing the letters?

30:46.628 --> 30:48.503
Of course it's a bloody man!

30:48.548 --> 30:50.807
How do you know how to
deliver a baby?

30:50.852 --> 30:54.519
I've lived a long life.

30:54.564 --> 30:56.951
But you were right, Crome.
The killer knows me,

30:56.996 --> 30:58.679
knows all about me.

30:58.724 --> 31:02.839
From the moment I arrived in this
country, my entire life here -

31:02.884 --> 31:08.036
they know everything.
And the next locale,

31:08.081 --> 31:12.596
the letter D, will also be
a place I have visited.

31:12.641 --> 31:16.676
We know that the next target's
name will begin with D,

31:16.721 --> 31:20.311
so to find them, let's make a list
of all the places beginning

31:20.356 --> 31:28.356
with D that I have been to.

31:34.500 --> 31:39.383
Dawlish, Deal, Didcot, Denmark
Hill, Doncaster, Dorking, Dundee,

31:39.428 --> 31:41.017
Dinas, Dover, Dove
Holes, Downham

31:41.062 --> 31:42.839
Market, Duke Street,
Dunrobin Castle

31:42.884 --> 31:44.866
and Dyce. One of
these stations, one

31:44.911 --> 31:46.935
of these cities,
towns and villages,

31:46.980 --> 31:50.156
is where ABC will be next.

31:50.201 --> 31:53.783
Go through the telephone directory,
go through the census,

31:53.828 --> 31:56.343
find every person with a surname
beginning with D.

31:56.388 --> 31:58.676
"Person"? I thought you said
the killer was after women.

31:58.721 --> 32:06.721
Well, maybe I changed my bloody
mind! Get on with it!

32:09.521 --> 32:14.647
How long is she gone for?
Couple of hours.

32:14.692 --> 32:17.996
What's this?

32:18.041 --> 32:20.535
Backgammon.

32:20.580 --> 32:23.351
I used to play a lot.
I used to be good.

32:23.396 --> 32:31.396
What happened?I stopped being good.

32:35.044 --> 32:37.303
Oh, Mr Cust!

32:37.348 --> 32:40.916
You're the killer! It's you!

32:40.961 --> 32:43.383
I'm a travelling salesman.
I sell stockings.

32:43.428 --> 32:47.415
SHE LAUGHS I'm only joking.

32:47.460 --> 32:51.716
The ABC is to do with the railway
guide - I read that in the paper.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.356
And you'd have to be thick to leave
that sort of clue if it was

32:54.401 --> 32:57.207
actually your name.

32:57.252 --> 33:01.879
Still, if it was you,
I'd get you to bump Mum off.

33:01.924 --> 33:05.335
Heave her down a flight of stairs.
Lily, murder is a crime.

33:05.380 --> 33:09.367
It's a sin against God.
I'm joking, again.

33:09.412 --> 33:11.756
Though sometimes -
I've got to be honest -

33:11.801 --> 33:19.801
it seems like a really good idea.
Make life easier.

33:36.868 --> 33:38.935
Waste of a good stocking,
if you ask me.

33:38.980 --> 33:46.980
Nothing else ties as tight.

33:51.908 --> 33:57.116
Tighter.

33:57.161 --> 34:01.975
So what does the A and B
stand for, then, Mr Cust?

34:02.020 --> 34:03.895
Alexander Bonaparte.

34:03.940 --> 34:05.815
Don't tell Mum that -

34:05.860 --> 34:09.335
she'll start ranting and raving
about the foreign.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.574
If she asks, just tell her you're
called Alexander -

34:11.620 --> 34:19.620
it's a good English name.

34:28.452 --> 34:30.967
Please, Lily.

34:31.012 --> 34:35.895
It lets it out, the darkness.

34:35.940 --> 34:43.940
Make it stop.

34:59.044 --> 35:07.044
It needs to hurt.

35:14.148 --> 35:22.148
Harder.

35:56.004 --> 36:03.063
KNOCKING AT DOOR

36:03.108 --> 36:06.007
Mademoiselle.

36:06.052 --> 36:07.735
Do you recognise this?

36:07.780 --> 36:12.023
The colour, perhaps -
does it correspond to anything you

36:12.068 --> 36:16.823
might have seen on your sister's
dressing table?

36:16.868 --> 36:19.447
The colour of a
packet of stockings?

36:19.492 --> 36:22.391
I'm sorry.

36:22.436 --> 36:25.655
Maybe your mother would know.
Is she here?

36:25.700 --> 36:29.879
Donald took her to
Herstmonceux Castle for the day.

36:29.924 --> 36:37.367
There's a tea room. They do cakes.
Mmm.

36:37.412 --> 36:42.423
I haven't been completely honest
about that night.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.495
I suppose I'm ashamed about it.

36:45.540 --> 36:52.023
We didn't agree to not say
anything, Donald and me, we just...

36:52.068 --> 36:54.967
You see, he, Donald and me...

36:55.012 --> 36:58.487
Had a prior understanding.

36:58.532 --> 37:01.623
Hmm?

37:01.668 --> 37:05.015
I observed a tension.

37:05.060 --> 37:11.287
He will not look at you,
yet you run after him.

37:11.332 --> 37:13.335
After he, erm...

37:13.380 --> 37:18.327
took up with Betty, he kept
coming round for his supper,

37:18.372 --> 37:20.636
like he always had done,

37:20.681 --> 37:23.276
whether Betty was in or not.

37:23.321 --> 37:28.567
Mum loves him, you see.
She's always wanted a son.

37:28.612 --> 37:32.855
Betty would never have married him.

37:32.900 --> 37:37.335
It was too much for me,
so I used to sit in the kitchen.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.556
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

37:40.601 --> 37:42.967
Mum's gone to the pictures.

37:43.012 --> 37:45.463
She still put you a plate up,
though.

37:45.508 --> 37:49.943
Feel free to eat it
in the other room.

37:49.988 --> 37:55.383
Oh, Megan, you are embarrassing
yourself, huh?

37:55.428 --> 37:57.836
Making out like this is everyone's
fault.

37:57.881 --> 38:00.247
But if you'd made more effort
with your hair,

38:00.292 --> 38:03.511
your clothes, been more...
go-getting, maybe I wouldn't have

38:03.556 --> 38:07.159
looked elsewhere. A man wants to
feel good with a girl on his arm,

38:07.204 --> 38:11.319
not dragged down.
You need an interest, a hobby.

38:11.364 --> 38:13.751
You should do a course or
something. Look at Betty.

38:13.796 --> 38:16.503
She's learning silver service -
not because she wants to be a

38:16.548 --> 38:19.639
waitress - so she can see how real
people behave for when we're

38:19.684 --> 38:22.391
both getting on in life.
She's thinking ahead.

38:22.436 --> 38:24.836
Betty's at the Palais.

38:24.881 --> 38:32.881
She's serving something all right,
but I doubt it's silver.

38:40.996 --> 38:44.087

38:55.972 --> 39:00.023
Donald?!You're coming home with me.
Let go, you dozy bastard!

39:00.068 --> 39:03.116
You stay here, I won't marry you!

39:03.161 --> 39:07.703
Oh, my broken heart!

39:07.748 --> 39:11.876
I wanted him to see I would have
been a good wife.

39:11.921 --> 39:14.935
I would have been faithful.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.855
I wanted to rub his nose in it.

39:16.900 --> 39:18.775
Hmm.

39:18.820 --> 39:24.919
In the circumstances,
that is entirely forgiveable.

39:24.964 --> 39:31.703
Really?Yes.

39:31.748 --> 39:35.756
I thank you for your help.

39:35.801 --> 39:39.836
You mustn't think badly of Donald.

39:39.881 --> 39:44.887
He is eating cake with your mother
while you, mademoiselle, grieving

39:44.932 --> 39:47.575
and alone, are peeling potatoes,

39:47.620 --> 39:55.620
so I will think what I please.

40:09.508 --> 40:12.535
There was a man at the Palais with
the same clothes as you!

40:12.580 --> 40:20.580
He walked right past me!

40:20.900 --> 40:24.375
TRAIN WHISTLE

40:24.420 --> 40:27.447
I'm told Lady Hermione believed
she saw me at Combeside,

40:27.492 --> 40:29.879
the day Sir Carmichael
was murdered.

40:29.924 --> 40:32.055
She gets very confused.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.719
I'll let you speak alone.

40:33.764 --> 40:37.436
She's, erm... She's looking forward
to seeing you, but you must expect

40:37.481 --> 40:40.951
her to be most uncomplimentary
about Thora, I'm afraid.

40:40.996 --> 40:48.996
The animosity seems to be the only
thing keeping her going.

40:57.828 --> 41:00.023
ALL: Happy Birthday to you

41:00.068 --> 41:02.276
Happy Birthday to you

41:05.572 --> 41:10.199
Happy Birthday to you.

41:10.244 --> 41:17.687
Bravo.

41:17.732 --> 41:20.567
Bon anniversaire, Lady Hermione.

41:20.612 --> 41:24.727
Oh, I am such an admirer!

41:24.772 --> 41:26.967
Such an admirer.

41:27.012 --> 41:30.487
Are we going to have a murder?
LAUGHTER.

41:30.532 --> 41:35.223
Please say it's going to be
spectacularly grisly!

41:35.268 --> 41:42.263
Mes enfants, ce sois - tonight -
we have prepared a murder of

41:42.308 --> 41:46.935
unparalleled and macabre savagery,

41:53.828 --> 42:01.556
Birthday murder!For you, this is a
game, but for me, it is my calling.

42:01.601 --> 42:04.151
I catch killers.

42:04.196 --> 42:06.007
Actual killers.

42:06.052 --> 42:10.167
Tomorrow I will hunt them again -
I will follow their trails of

42:10.212 --> 42:14.583
blood, but, mes enfants, tonight

42:14.628 --> 42:21.815
blood will be our entertainment.Oh!

42:21.860 --> 42:24.247
Birthday murder.

42:24.292 --> 42:29.047
Birthday murder! Birthday murder!
Birthday murder! Birthday murder!

42:29.092 --> 42:31.223
Birthday murder! Birthday murder!

42:31.268 --> 42:36.919
Birthday murder! Birthday murder!
Birthday murder!

42:36.964 --> 42:43.255
Don't come too close. I... I...
I smell.

42:43.300 --> 42:47.479
It's in my throat, you see.
Sometimes I can taste it.

42:47.524 --> 42:51.476
Je suis desole,
for all your sorrows.

42:51.521 --> 42:55.991
Oh, I've been told Miss Grey
is in a hotel.

42:56.036 --> 42:57.911
Franklin is like my darling Car -

42:57.956 --> 43:01.815
he won't hear a word against
that bloody girl.

43:01.860 --> 43:05.783
A pretty face and a sob story about
being an orphan and they are

43:05.828 --> 43:12.836
both putty in her hands.

43:12.881 --> 43:18.775
Lady Hermione, I'm told you
believed I came to the house -

43:18.820 --> 43:23.639
not years ago, but recently.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.903
Oh, the morphine
plays tricks on me.

43:26.948 --> 43:31.575
Sometimes I forget
that Car is dead.

43:31.620 --> 43:39.620
Such cruel tricks. SHE GROANS.

43:40.260 --> 43:45.015
It was, er... just a person.

43:45.060 --> 43:49.436
I was by the window
against the sun,

43:49.481 --> 43:52.887
which is supposed
to be good for me.

43:52.932 --> 43:58.391
The same hat, the coat.

43:58.436 --> 44:01.655
No, thank you,
we don't buy anything at the door.

44:01.700 --> 44:07.927
But it was just a salesman.

44:07.972 --> 44:11.319
Of course, I knew it wasn't you.

44:11.364 --> 44:15.927
But just for a moment,
I was so happy.

44:15.972 --> 44:19.127
"Poirot is here," I thought.

44:19.172 --> 44:27.172
"Now we shall have fun, like we
did when we were beautiful."

44:38.628 --> 44:43.767
Did you ask Miss Grey about it?

44:43.812 --> 44:51.812
I had another attack.

44:55.721 --> 45:03.721
And then Car was killed,
and I was so confused.

45:04.932 --> 45:10.076
What did this visitor look like,
the one you thought was me?

45:10.121 --> 45:17.495
Young? Old?I'm not sure.

45:17.540 --> 45:23.276
Thora was always waiting
for me to die.

45:23.321 --> 45:28.183
Even when I was still alive.

45:28.228 --> 45:32.407
Don't let her get her claws
into Franklin.

45:32.452 --> 45:40.452
Promise me she won't get her
claws into him.

45:59.332 --> 46:01.916
Er, I... I don't know
what he looked like!

46:01.961 --> 46:04.087
You don't look travelling
salesmen in the face,

46:04.132 --> 46:05.943
it only encourages them!

46:05.988 --> 46:07.629
I... I bought a pair
of stockings from him

46:07.674 --> 46:09.399
to make him go away.
Was he dressed like me?

46:09.444 --> 46:10.999
I don't know!

46:11.044 --> 46:13.879
What type of stockings?
Do you remember the name?

46:13.924 --> 46:16.375
I don't know.
What colour was the packet?

46:16.420 --> 46:19.063
I threw the packet away and I only
wore the stockings for a few

46:19.108 --> 46:21.175
hours and then I threw
them away, too.Why?

46:21.220 --> 46:23.113
Because I have long legs
and they were too short

46:23.158 --> 46:25.015
for me! Thora, why didn't
you say any of this?

46:25.060 --> 46:27.476
Because I forgot.
You forgot? How could you forget?

46:27.521 --> 46:30.356
Because I did! There were police
everywhere, and Sir Carmichael was

46:30.401 --> 46:32.350
like a father to me, and
now everyone's shouting

46:32.395 --> 46:34.103
me, and I've done
nothing wrong except...

46:34.148 --> 46:36.407
No-one's shouting.Yes, you are!
Why are you even here?

46:36.452 --> 46:38.293
You said you'd be at Combeside.
None of this is

46:38.338 --> 46:40.292
fair... I had to come down
when I found this out!

46:40.337 --> 46:42.743
..None of this at all. No-one
understands or cares about how

46:42.788 --> 46:50.679
bloody awful it is to be me!
SHE SOBS.

46:50.724 --> 46:58.724
SHE CRIES

46:58.788 --> 47:04.439
Excuse me for a moment.

47:04.484 --> 47:07.511
Thora...

47:07.556 --> 47:12.183
Come on, now. I'm sorry.
Don't cry, I know, I'm sorry.

47:12.228 --> 47:15.596
I... I... I shouldn't
have shouted at you.

47:15.641 --> 47:17.943
I'm sorry.

47:17.988 --> 47:25.988
Come here. I'm sorry.

47:38.596 --> 47:46.596
GUNSHOT AND SCREAMS

47:48.324 --> 47:51.927
There is a man there, sleeping.

47:51.972 --> 47:53.783
Yes, he comes in most nights.

47:53.828 --> 47:55.447
This is for him.

47:55.492 --> 47:58.676
Then he should have it before it
gets cold, Father.

47:58.721 --> 48:00.311
Yes.

48:00.356 --> 48:02.295
Peter. Peter.

PETER GRUNTS

48:05.028 --> 48:09.847
Thank you.

48:09.892 --> 48:11.959
I wish you would take communion.

48:12.004 --> 48:14.903
It grieves me to see you leave mass
without the Eucharist.

48:14.948 --> 48:19.255
I cannot take communion
without confession.

48:19.300 --> 48:21.047
I do not confess.

48:21.092 --> 48:23.415
I believe it would bring you
some peace.

48:23.460 --> 48:26.003
Why should we have peace?
Why should

48:26.048 --> 48:28.215
anyone, here, now, have peace?

48:28.260 --> 48:31.927
We should be raging.Is that what
you are? Raging?

48:31.972 --> 48:35.639
And doubtful, and terrified.
Of what?

48:35.684 --> 48:37.687
Failure.

48:37.732 --> 48:40.119
Of not being enough.

48:40.164 --> 48:43.767
You can't possibly know that
you would fail.Oh, I do.

48:43.812 --> 48:47.223
I have failed -
failed terribly, catastrophically.

48:47.268 --> 48:50.876
I was not enough. Nor was he.

48:50.921 --> 48:53.047
I doubt him.

48:53.092 --> 48:54.967
I doubt all of it.

48:55.012 --> 48:57.207
So, Father Anselm,

48:57.252 --> 48:58.935
what do you say to that?

48:58.980 --> 49:02.036
I say that the confessional is just
a few short steps over there.

49:02.081 --> 49:04.503
Come with me.

49:04.548 --> 49:07.767
You've already spoken it out loud -
say it in there so that I can

49:07.812 --> 49:13.655
absolve you and you can
receive the sacrament.

49:13.700 --> 49:21.700
God forgives all.But I do not.

52:16.676 --> 52:18.615

52:18.660 --> 52:22.967
But why would ABC give such
a blatant clue?

52:23.012 --> 52:24.956
Because he's a cocky shit.

52:25.001 --> 52:28.436
They all get cocky,
that's what brings them down.

52:28.481 --> 52:31.863

No.
