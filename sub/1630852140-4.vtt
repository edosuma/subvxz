Is there something there?"

42:53.170 --> 42:56.030
narrator: And we'll give
the last word to Chad.

42:56.050 --> 42:58.079
I'm sure he knows how to
make these two remaining dates

42:58.099 --> 43:00.090
feel special after that.

43:00.110 --> 43:02.219
- You know, we did build
a connection quickly.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.110
Everything that I got to know
about Shannon

43:05.130 --> 43:07.210
in the short time period--

43:07.230 --> 43:10.000
she did seem
really genuine.

43:10.019 --> 43:13.119
- With Chad saying
that he cares about Shannon,

43:13.139 --> 43:16.019
I'm not gonna lie--I'm
feeling a little annoyed.

43:16.039 --> 43:18.079
- It was nothing
she did wrong.

43:19.130 --> 43:21.219
- The way, like,
I felt tonight,

43:22.000 --> 43:23.070
like, I could tell
that...

43:23.090 --> 43:26.079
like, I'm already
in love with you.
