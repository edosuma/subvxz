WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:10.093
Hey, Rick!

00:10.844 --> 00:13.471
Need me for any adventures?

00:14.180 --> 00:16.015
Adventures? Remember those?

00:16.015 --> 00:19.728
Not right now, Morty!
But definitely next week though.

00:19.728 --> 00:23.022
You been saying that a while now buddy,
so I think I’m gonna give

00:23.022 --> 00:26.651
you a little nudge by cashing
in a few of these bad boys.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.154
We’re still doing the punch card system?

00:29.154 --> 00:32.157
Never stopped.
Read ’em and weep.

00:32.532 --> 00:36.119
Fully punched cards, each entitling
me to an adventure of my choosing.

00:36.119 --> 00:38.663
- I don’t make the rules.
- I do, you little gremlin.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.582
And I definitely did
not stamp all these.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.667
You never remember to stamp the
cards, you’re always drunk.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.419
I didn’t know we were still doing this!

00:44.419 --> 00:47.088
This stinks to high heaven Morty,
I’m not accepting these.

00:47.088 --> 00:50.049
I knew you were going to do this.
So I got receipts, bitch.

00:50.049 --> 00:51.217
I kept notes.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.635
This is gibberish.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.638
"Isle of the Mortysaurs"?
"Takes One to Know One"?

00:55.638 --> 00:57.140
I make up titles for each adventure.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.143
You did the same thing for that MS
readathon at your school, Morty

01:00.143 --> 01:00.977
and you didn’t read shit.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.188
It’s okay to lie when you’re
fighting Multiple Sclerosis!

01:03.188 --> 01:05.231
Or when you think you won’t get caught!

01:05.231 --> 01:06.524
How are you going to catch me?

01:06.524 --> 01:09.819
You done and did it now, little man.
That’s your ass.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.822
Don’t grift a grifter, Morty.
I got friends in cosmic places.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.991
I need an audit.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.952
Right!
You were already watching.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.913
- I’ll come get you.
- What is this?

01:21.623 --> 01:23.500
I am The Observer!

01:23.500 --> 01:25.668
You’re so busted.
Look at your face, you’re so fucked.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.879
I Observe All!

01:27.879 --> 01:29.547
They observe all, Morty.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.883
- Cosmic allseeing species.
- So?

01:31.883 --> 01:34.385
So, they’re basically
universal police body-cams but

01:34.385 --> 01:36.429
you can’t turn them off before
you beat a minority.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.848
Or in your case,
before you cook the adventure books!

01:38.848 --> 01:40.767
- I don’t do that!
- We gonna find out!

01:40.767 --> 01:43.478
I’m here for this!

02:16.553 --> 02:18.847
I bet a solid seventy percent
of these are bullshit.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.641
Quit your bitching and do the audit,
I got nothing to hide!

02:21.641 --> 02:23.643
Alright, Observer!
Gimme "Truth or Dare".

02:24.143 --> 02:26.062
- Christ! These names, Morty.
- It’s shorthand!

02:26.062 --> 02:31.526
I have observed it!
Now gaze upon me and so shall you...

02:34.821 --> 02:37.073
Two attack patterns
and a giant glowing weak spot

02:37.448 --> 02:40.493
- Legend of Zelda tutorial-ass bullshit.
- I thought it was kind of fun.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.371
Halt! Unidentified adventurers.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.832
We are the guardians of this sanctuary.

02:46.165 --> 02:50.044
One of us tells only truths,
the other, only lies.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.088
- You ever fucked this guy’s wife?
- Yes.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.258
Well, how about that, he guessed right.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.093
I forgive you!

02:57.510 --> 02:59.470
- Oh shit!
- Alright, next room.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.555
No, I wanna watch.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.933
Did you see how one of them lied?

03:03.933 --> 03:06.269
Fine! I’ll call that one legit,
I’m not here to nitpick,

03:06.269 --> 03:07.937
I’m here to find blatant fraud.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.106
Okay!
Show me "Late Night Western".

03:11.691 --> 03:17.113
Morty! Take me drive me,
wan go western bacon.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.698
Morty western bacon now.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.457
- Before you say anything...
- I knew it! Busted!

03:27.457 --> 03:29.125
You’re banned from that Carls Jr!

03:29.125 --> 03:31.502
That doesn’t make the drive-thru
an adventure, Morty. Invalid.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.589
Sounds like it’s anyone’s game!

03:35.131 --> 03:38.051
Well, no!
It’s not a bet, it’s an audit.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.511
Observer, show us
"Maximum Overdrivewith Clothes"

03:44.724 --> 03:47.185
At least this is better than cars,
cars can run you over.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.273
Okay, no, this is worse.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.568
- Adventure, suck it.
- Alright, fine.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.820
How about "Whistlering Dixie".

04:03.034 --> 04:05.578
Whistler! Whattaya got to tag and
bag these bastards?

04:05.578 --> 04:09.666
Made this little puppy after
I bagged my first neck-rophiliac.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.418
Double action triggers pumping out
14 hundred kilos

04:12.418 --> 04:14.128
of holy water per square inch.

04:14.504 --> 04:18.216
This old girl’s got dry-aged,
Sicilian garlic expelling out at

04:18.216 --> 04:23.471
32 hundred feet per second,
is swaddled by 5200 Solar-joules

04:23.471 --> 04:26.975
of raw ultraviolet.
And she’s only getting started,

04:26.975 --> 04:29.310
I’m talking
crucifix-shaped Chinese stars,

04:29.310 --> 04:31.270
mirror-tipped wooden stakes, and a...

04:31.604 --> 04:33.398
What? Hello?
Guys?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.527
Morty, that was just an old man
rambling at us.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.444
People died!

04:38.444 --> 04:40.947
So, by your logic,
9/11 was an adventure?

04:40.947 --> 04:42.198
Tweet it, see who agrees.

04:42.198 --> 04:45.243
- Very well! Bear witness to 9/11!
- What?

04:45.243 --> 04:48.621
Dude, don’t, just you need to let
us throw to the stuff, okay?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.040
What’s next?
What the hell is "Leg Day"?

04:53.042 --> 04:55.044
Hey look, Morty!
I’m a leg!

04:56.170 --> 04:58.715
A leg, Morty!
I’m Leg Rick!

04:59.340 --> 05:00.800
Okay! I’ll give you that last one.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.012
- What? I mean I’ll take it but...
- Hey Morty! Check this out.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.722
That’s clearly unlicensed.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.724
- License this!
- Wait, what are you doing?

05:08.766 --> 05:11.436
Hey Smith, you look hungry!
How about some knuckle pie?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.815
Jeez. Rick’s implants.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.067
Big Doug... get the truck.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.820
I’ve never felt so alive!

05:27.660 --> 05:28.578
Man.

06:03.362 --> 06:07.784
- Turn back into a boat!
- I’m trying!

06:10.828 --> 06:12.538
- I’m trying!
- Big Doug!

06:14.373 --> 06:16.042
Big Doug, no.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.088
There’s my guy! Come on!
The hamsters turned on me, Morty.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.089
We gotta go.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.717
- R.I.P, Big Doug!
- Wasn’t even in that one!

06:24.717 --> 06:27.970
Who cares, it wasn’t even on my list.
This guy just cued it up!

06:27.970 --> 06:30.640
Speaking of cues,
what about all those times

06:30.640 --> 06:33.226
- you two misunderstood each other?
- Wait, what?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.727
Are you setting up a series of them?

06:34.727 --> 06:38.940
Trust me! The key is grouping them
with thematic connections.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.487
I just want to talk to Morty in private,
about something unrelated.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.405
We’ll be right back.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.992
Okay, this guy might
have been kind of a mistake.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.369
He’s really, like, aggressive.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.497
He’s steamrolling us. He thinks
he’s hosting a fucking clip show.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.332
- And I don’t like his voice.
- I don’t like his voice.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.625
I don’t like that he’s doing jokes,

06:57.625 --> 06:59.127
I don’t like that he’s
talking down to you.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.879
Thank you. Okay.
Let’s rethink this.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.673
I still don’t trust these,
but I’ll accept these cards

07:03.673 --> 07:05.842
- at 70 cents on the dollar.
- Done. Fair.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.593
How do we get rid of him?

07:07.593 --> 07:09.887
I’ll just pay the asshole and
tell him he did a great job.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.889
<i>He thinks he’s hosting a fucking
clip show.</i>

07:11.889 --> 07:13.683
- And I don’t like his voice.
- I don’t like his voice.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.976
<i>I don’t like that he’s doing jokes</i>

07:14.976 --> 07:16.060
- Okay, well, that’s...
<i>- I don’t like that...</i>

07:16.060 --> 07:18.354
that’s on us.
Should have seen that coming.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.939
Seeing is more my thing.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.399
Well, then you know
he’s about to pay you.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.026
And "tell me I did a great job"?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.487
Fine! You caught us.
We secretly think you suck.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.615
Here’s twice what I owe you,
that’s how little conversation

07:29.615 --> 07:31.075
we want to have about you leaving.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.744
I have never seen two bigger assholes!

07:33.744 --> 07:37.206
- And I see all assholes!
- Then you can see yours out.

07:37.623 --> 07:38.541
Bye.

07:40.918 --> 07:41.836
Christ.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.472
Shit! Hot, so hot.

07:53.472 --> 07:55.725
Gotta start in the middle,
statistically the coolest.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.394
<i>You won’t find
a carb on my plate, Morty.</i>

07:58.394 --> 08:00.229
<i>- I’m all about that keto.</i>
- No!

08:00.229 --> 08:01.898
- Is that a fucking...
- Clip?

08:02.440 --> 08:04.692
<i>I’m a fats man.
Gimme all the fats!</i>

08:04.692 --> 08:07.195
That burrito looks pretty carby!

08:07.195 --> 08:09.322
- This fucking guy.
- That’s your move?

08:09.322 --> 08:12.491
Diet shaming? Just take the L, man!
This is embarrassing.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.203
I’ll show you embarrassing!

08:17.330 --> 08:19.916
Do it, Morty! It’s the only way
to save the universe!

08:19.916 --> 08:22.251
How? How is it the only way?

08:22.251 --> 08:26.005
Morty, I’m dying!
It’s up to you.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.428
- Rick!
- What the hell are you doing?

08:32.428 --> 08:35.932
Saving the universe! I think!
Right, Rick?

08:42.521 --> 08:45.358
- This guy's nuts!
- Screw you, Morty.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.693
What the hell?
You told me I was a hero!

08:47.693 --> 08:49.946
- You were that night.
- What the hell’s going on?

08:49.946 --> 08:52.865
Is that angry stone playing...
video-clips?

08:52.865 --> 08:55.785
It’s some weirdo Grandpa hired
to prove I’m a bad person.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.621
Turns out people that take that job
aren’t fun to be around.

08:58.996 --> 08:59.956
Get out of here!

08:59.956 --> 09:04.293
<i>Sidewalk’s public property, bro!
I can observe all I want from here!</i>

09:04.293 --> 09:07.630
This isn’t our problem, Dad.
Please make this loud thing go away.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.507
I was studying for a test.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.591
<i>No, you weren’t!</i>

09:11.050 --> 09:12.385
Fucking rock asshole.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.511
Now you’ve done it!

09:13.511 --> 09:17.640
As they’ve shamed me,
so shall I now shame you!

09:21.978 --> 09:23.813
<i>Mom? Are you drinking wine in there?</i>

09:23.813 --> 09:26.482
No! I’m shitting.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.901
<i>Bitch, I know the sound of a toilet
lid moving.</i>

09:29.735 --> 09:30.903
Two birds, one stone.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.738
More embarrassing for Mom than me.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.992
- I wasn’t lying, I was going to shit.
- What’s going on here?

09:35.992 --> 09:38.703
Cosmic being playing
embarrassing clips out of spite?

09:38.703 --> 09:39.954
Damn, Jerry. Nailed it.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.998
I was watching from the upstairs window.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.916
Well, watch this, loser!

09:44.542 --> 09:47.461
Morty, I’m throwing out some stuff
from our last couple adventures,

09:47.461 --> 09:50.006
- you got any use for this diamond?
- <i>Nope. I’m good.</i>

09:58.264 --> 09:59.181
This is gonna be fine.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.688
I’m sorry!
I can’t stop once I start!

10:07.606 --> 10:09.525
Whatever!
Everyone knows I’m embarrassing,

10:09.525 --> 10:12.403
- I’m bulletproof.
- Oh my God, this is so sad.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.531
Not as sad as you after this!

10:16.115 --> 10:19.452
<i>The so called "Hottie Snatchers"
have spread to Canada and Mexico,</i>

10:19.452 --> 10:22.621
<i>grabbing the most attractive residents
and taking them god knows where.</i>

10:22.621 --> 10:26.542
<i>All Americans, even sub-sevens,
are advised to stay indoors.</i>

10:26.542 --> 10:28.377
<i>You certainly
wouldn’t be safe out there.</i>

10:28.377 --> 10:29.879
<i>Not on the air, Michael.</i>

10:30.588 --> 10:31.672
BRB, bathroom.

10:32.757 --> 10:33.966
I need to know!

10:38.471 --> 10:42.183
It’s okay, It’s not real!
They’re just doing it at random!

10:44.226 --> 10:45.728
Is everything okay? I heard a...

10:49.815 --> 10:52.568
You too?
It’s not so bad once you get used to it.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.697
I don’t deserve this,
I just walked downstairs.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.574
Okay, well if Dad’s
just gonna stand here,

10:58.574 --> 11:01.285
should I do something?
Unless that somehow tees me up.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.286
Walked right into it!

11:02.995 --> 11:05.706
This is our target, Dichotomus Daniel.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.377
That was my chair.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.546
- It was a fart.
- Birdperson always knows.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.673
It’s true! He’s got that beak!

11:14.673 --> 11:15.966
Get lost, you piece of shit!

11:15.966 --> 11:18.260
Why? So you can do stuff like this?

11:26.227 --> 11:27.269
Morty!

11:27.269 --> 11:30.272
I’m afraid the only way out
is through the bottom of this massive

11:30.272 --> 11:31.315
vat of whale semen.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.943
Well, that last one
was just for shock value.

11:33.943 --> 11:34.985
Fuck this guy!

11:34.985 --> 11:38.989
If you can’t take the heat,
get out of the watching'!

11:38.989 --> 11:40.366
You suck!

11:40.366 --> 11:43.327
Showing weird shit just cuz
we wouldn’t let you treat our lives

11:43.327 --> 11:44.120
like a clip show!

11:44.120 --> 11:45.663
- Get him Morty!
- Mess him up, little bro!

11:45.663 --> 11:48.791
What? You gonna beat me up
like the piss guy?

11:48.791 --> 11:50.126
Hey! Not cool!

11:50.126 --> 11:52.378
Why don’t you tee up this clip
of me kicking your ass!

11:55.631 --> 12:02.096
I’m all rocks now!
I never saw this coming...

12:03.973 --> 12:06.517
Shit!
These guys can die?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.644
- I thought they were cosmic.
- You know what?

12:08.644 --> 12:10.855
I say we leave this thing
in the street, deny any involvement

12:10.855 --> 12:12.106
and just hope this blows over.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.150
Unless, of course,
<i>they play this exact clip</i>

12:14.150 --> 12:16.986
<i>on a screen in front of a jury
with some kind of built-in bias.</i>

12:16.986 --> 12:20.406
As an observer,
I try to stay impartial,

12:20.406 --> 12:22.825
but I am not seeing innocence.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.911
- It’s not blowing over, Rick.
- I’d tell you to stay positive, Morty

12:25.911 --> 12:27.663
but I do not like the looks
of that jury.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.542
I can’t believe
we got ourselves into this mess

12:31.542 --> 12:33.878
over something as petty
as what an adventure is...

12:33.878 --> 12:37.173
I guess I can admit
I got a little loose with the stamps.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.009
Gotcha! Can the stenographer read back
that confession, please?

12:40.009 --> 12:43.512
Silence! The killing
of an observer is unforgivable.

12:43.512 --> 12:47.224
We must now decide
whether to end your existence.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.311
Your honor! If everyone here
has truly seen everything,

12:50.311 --> 12:53.522
then you all know that my grandson and
I did this whole thing with giants.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.191
Did what whole thing?

12:55.191 --> 12:59.278
I will address that!
I’m your court appointed defender.

12:59.278 --> 13:03.032
Your honor, observe the time
Rick and Morty did this with giants!

13:03.741 --> 13:07.077
This is an open and shut case, Morty.
Y’know what do ya think is gonna happen,

13:07.077 --> 13:08.787
some magical angel’s
gonna show up and...

13:08.787 --> 13:12.124
Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the
violation of civil liberties!

13:12.124 --> 13:14.835
The moments are practically identical,
your honor,

13:14.835 --> 13:17.713
I move for a mistrial
on the grounds it bumps.

13:17.713 --> 13:21.133
If the argument is that
Rick and Morty repeat their mistakes,

13:21.133 --> 13:23.802
- the prosecution agrees!
- Oh God!

13:23.802 --> 13:26.805
You sound just like the guy we killed. Allegedly.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.557
That was my brother!

13:28.891 --> 13:31.977
- I didn’t like his voice either!
- Well, this isn’t gonna help our case.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.021
Neither will this next clip!

13:34.772 --> 13:37.233
Morty! I made you a gorilla gun.
Pretty cool.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.902
A gorilla gun?
Does this do what I think it does?

13:41.111 --> 13:42.363
Where’s your lunch money, punk?

13:42.363 --> 13:45.866
Lunch money? Are you sure you
wouldn’t rather have a banana?

13:48.953 --> 13:50.996
I thought it
would turn him into a gorilla...

13:50.996 --> 13:52.831
Why would you want
a bully to be a gorilla?

13:53.415 --> 13:56.043
It was a gun that kills gorillas.
Please go easy on him,

13:56.043 --> 13:58.003
this one’s on me
and it won’t happen again.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.589
- Morty, this is a bully gun.
- Cool!

14:00.589 --> 14:01.840
Any questions about it?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.510
- Not really.
- Should be self-explanatory. Have fun.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.596
- Give me your backpack.
- You trying to bully me?

14:08.472 --> 14:11.100
Well, how are you going to bully...
another bully?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.018
What are you doing?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.692
I feel like this one’s not
entirely my fault.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.194
- Okay, how do you feel?
- I’m okay.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.863
I mean,
maybe just stop giving me guns, or...

14:24.863 --> 14:27.950
Or make them less ambiguous, way
ahead of you. Here. Take this.

14:28.325 --> 14:31.287
This is a gun,
and I want to be really specific here.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.540
This is a gun that you only use
to shoot bad people.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.208
- Are we clear?
- Okay, Rick.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.587
- When are you going to use that?
- When I want to shoot a bad person.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.588
Okay.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.632
- I had a great time tonight, Jessica.
- Hey. Give me your money.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.301
Why don’t you take this instead?

14:47.761 --> 14:49.054
- Jeffrey Dahmer?
- Hi.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.889
- What’s happening?
- I don’t know, just run.

14:52.308 --> 14:56.353
Let the record show this bit
continued for several more guns.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.981
What are we even guilty of in that one,
being kind of dumb?

14:58.981 --> 15:01.483
For being dumb over and over!

15:02.192 --> 15:06.488
But your honor, is that not
the definition of experimentation?

15:06.488 --> 15:09.158
The foundation of science?
And are Rick and Morty

15:09.158 --> 15:13.162
therefore not only not not learning,
but therefore actively learning?

15:13.495 --> 15:14.830
Observe this example!

15:16.832 --> 15:18.876
How long before Ben Franklin
comes back to life?

15:19.627 --> 15:20.628
Holy shit! Yes!

15:21.712 --> 15:23.088
Shit! He came back evil.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.549
What do you think will happen
if we bury him again?

15:25.549 --> 15:26.508
You don’t know?

15:26.508 --> 15:29.053
This is my first time
using Pet Semetary soil, Morty.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.889
I mean as long as
we’re asking questions...

15:31.889 --> 15:33.557
We’ve been here so long my phone died.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.435
- It’s not gonna charge your phone!
- So you can be curious and I can’t?

15:36.435 --> 15:37.645
Fuck, you’re right.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.856
We’re sitting on top of brand new
science here, let’s gather some data!

15:43.692 --> 15:46.362
- Put your back into it, Morty!
- You think it’ll refill the tank?

15:46.362 --> 15:47.655
Good pitch, Morty!

15:48.238 --> 15:50.449
Okay! Let’s bury that kangaroo
from the waist down.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.451
Holy shit! Will only his legs come back?

15:52.451 --> 15:53.702
Who knows?

15:53.702 --> 15:55.871
I’m having a great time with
you tonight, Morty!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.415
- What’s that one?
- Ben Franklin!

15:58.415 --> 16:00.125
Remember we tried wrapping him

16:00.125 --> 16:01.669
in tin foil to see
if it’d shield him from the evil?

16:01.669 --> 16:02.670
Oh yeah.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.547
Fuck! It’s hot!

16:06.048 --> 16:10.260
Jesus Christ!
It cooked him like a pig at a luau.

16:10.969 --> 16:13.514
- It’s so moist.
- Rick! That’s a guy!

16:13.514 --> 16:15.391
Man, what is this place doing to us?

16:15.891 --> 16:18.060
Is nothing sacred to you two?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.604
What are these clips?
What are we even on trial for anymore?

16:20.604 --> 16:24.358
What’s anyone on trial for, son?
Being good or evil.

16:24.358 --> 16:28.070
Look, sure we can be irreverent
but we’re far from evil.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.448
- We make more friends than enemies!
- Let’s run the tape on that one!

16:32.241 --> 16:34.159
Rick, can you make my churros
come to life?

16:34.159 --> 16:35.160
On it!

16:36.161 --> 16:37.955
Hi! I’m Churry!

16:37.955 --> 16:40.416
- Churry, do you want to have fun?
- Let’s go!

17:08.235 --> 17:10.446
This has been the best time of my
life, Churry.

17:11.572 --> 17:14.491
Okay, thanks Rick! You can turn
him back into a regular Churros now.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.243
What?
I can’t turn him back.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.662
You asked me to bring him to life.
Done!

17:18.662 --> 17:21.874
But he’s a churros, he doesn’t have
internal organs, a brain, etc.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.418
in order to live, I had to make
him functionally immortal.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.171
What?

17:33.218 --> 17:35.804
My family!

17:35.804 --> 17:37.556
Goodbye, Churry. I’ll miss you.

17:42.102 --> 17:48.025
These are just regular churro?
Oh my God! No!

17:48.025 --> 17:52.070
Mark my words, Morty.
I shall leave you as you left me.

17:52.070 --> 17:55.991
On a barren planet.
Praying for death!

17:56.533 --> 17:58.327
I’m starting to see
why this lawyer was free.

17:58.327 --> 18:01.038
Okay! Well we never
intentionally hurt people.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.206
We adventure!

18:02.206 --> 18:04.416
Stuff goes wrong,
we don’t just murder for fun.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.460
Here’s a clip about that topic!

18:07.544 --> 18:10.589
I did it, Morty! I killed the versions
of us that were in Space Jam!

18:10.589 --> 18:13.008
- Help me with the bodies!
- How you’d do it, Rick?

18:13.008 --> 18:14.802
It was easy, Morty.
They welcomed death!

18:14.802 --> 18:15.844
They wanted out,
Morty!

18:16.261 --> 18:19.348
No! You don’t get it,
they begged me. It was a kindness!

18:19.348 --> 18:22.559
- Was that helpful?
- It was for the prosecution!

18:22.559 --> 18:25.729
- Okay, I’ve heard enough!
- No, you fucking haven’t.

18:25.729 --> 18:28.440
If we’re about to die,
at least let us defend ourselves.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.942
- The outrage!
- Seems iffy.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.528
I’ll allow it. But no lolly gagging!

18:32.528 --> 18:34.738
I only need one clip, your honor.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.658
If it pleases the court,
hold on to your tits.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.623
I’m a leg, Morty! You like that?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.334
I know you do.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.503
We already saw that one.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.464
- No, that’s the other time I did it.
- That was your Hail Mary?

18:52.464 --> 18:56.176
- I held onto my tits for nothing!
- That was mid!

18:56.176 --> 19:00.472
I hereby find Rick and Morty guilty!
Time to die!

19:09.231 --> 19:11.608
- What in tarnation?
- Plot twist!

19:11.608 --> 19:13.569
Whattaya expect?
You gave me access to your tech.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.780
Look, I’m not saying we’re heroes

19:16.780 --> 19:18.740
but in the two minutes
I’ve had access to your server

19:18.740 --> 19:21.451
I can observe you’re no better.
Here, let’s see a clip.

19:23.829 --> 19:28.375
Help! Please!
Oh my God! Please!

19:32.337 --> 19:36.592
Absurd! If the Observer was in the clip,
who was watching?

19:36.592 --> 19:37.593
Glad you asked!

19:38.385 --> 19:39.303
Please!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.099
Jesus Christ.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.935
You can’t shame us for watching!
It’s who we are!

19:46.935 --> 19:49.521
Right! And you’d never take
advantage of that.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.734
Hot copies! Freshly watched!
I’ve got Avatar 3 through 6!

19:53.734 --> 19:57.446
Friends and Family screening, the VFX
aren’t done, but they’re still blue!

19:57.863 --> 20:00.032
It’s not my fault I saw those
movies!

20:00.032 --> 20:02.451
Yes! We observe,
it’s all we do!

20:02.451 --> 20:04.161
It’s not all you do.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.581
I’ll give you guys twenty dollars
to fight each other.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.375
Money, money.

20:10.834 --> 20:14.254
As it turns out, you do plenty!
You’re just as bad as us!

20:14.254 --> 20:17.716
We’re not all bad,
I observe a couple of bad apples!

20:17.716 --> 20:20.802
Who are you calling an apple?
Should we all observe

20:20.802 --> 20:22.387
what you did with Tom’s wife?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.599
Observe me harder! Harder!

20:25.974 --> 20:29.311
I regret nothing, Tom!
The only thing you could never see

20:29.311 --> 20:31.063
was what a treasure Nancy was.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.649
- I’ll kill you!
- I’d like to observe you try!

20:37.069 --> 20:39.696
Jeez, Rick!
People be fucking each other’s wives.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.991
Marriage is a scam, Morty.
Let’s scram.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.160
Wait! I still have more clips!

20:46.328 --> 20:48.580
Morty, I appreciate
what you were trying to do

20:48.580 --> 20:50.999
with the punch cards,
my whole groove thing.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.835
Thanks. So is this a stamp?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.796
Or you gonna make me count this
as my adventure?

20:55.796 --> 20:57.714
How about we just ignore this one.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.424
Good call.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.177
- Eighty cents on the dollar?
- Seventy five.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.178
Done.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.640
Whattaya say, Rick?
Fly through space, come upon something,

21:06.640 --> 21:09.351
maybe I have a moral objection,
stuff gets messy

21:09.351 --> 21:10.560
and you ultimately bail us out?

21:10.560 --> 21:11.895
Let’s take it for a spin.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.399
Rick and Morty! We’re back, baby!
Check the glove box!

21:15.941 --> 21:17.317
Another gun!!

21:49.891 --> 21:52.436
Morty, see you at the frolf
mixer tomorrow?

21:52.436 --> 21:53.979
Sure thing Jimmy.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.899
I knew this day would come.

21:59.985 --> 22:00.986
God!

22:03.488 --> 22:05.365
Nice! Free Churros.
