WEBVTT

00:01.317 --> 00:04.119
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.153 --> 00:05.820
Hey, Cliffie.
What you doing?

00:05.854 --> 00:09.074
Uh, writing a letter
of application for the Eco pod.

00:09.108 --> 00:10.542
What the heck's the Eco pod?

00:10.543 --> 00:12.744
It's a totally
self-contained environment

00:12.745 --> 00:15.881
located in a mile-wide bubble
underneath the desert floor.

00:15.915 --> 00:17.716
Yeah.

00:17.717 --> 00:20.134
It's gonna be inhabited
by the best and the brightest

00:20.135 --> 00:24.372
of the, uh, human species,
so I-I thought I'd apply.

00:24.374 --> 00:26.558
They're gonna have a zoo
in there, too?

00:26.592 --> 00:28.760
Yeah. Yeah, very
funny, Carla.

00:28.761 --> 00:30.679
You'll be laughing out of
the other side of your face

00:30.680 --> 00:33.181
when they make me Postmaster
General of the Eco pod.

00:33.182 --> 00:37.018
Actually, the Eco pod
does have some scientific merit.

00:37.019 --> 00:39.187
It was designed
by a colleague of Lilith's,

00:39.188 --> 00:40.455
Dr. Louis Pascal.

00:40.490 --> 00:41.940
It will serve as a prototype

00:41.941 --> 00:43.775
for the colonization of space.

00:43.776 --> 00:45.676
Plus which,
the grant money is incredible.

00:45.677 --> 00:47.612
I hear
Pascal's driving a Lexus.

00:49.282 --> 00:51.132
Boy, I sure hope I get a shot

00:51.167 --> 00:53.034
at being sealed
up in that thing.

00:53.036 --> 00:54.886
Say, would a petition help?

00:54.921 --> 00:57.188
It might.

00:57.189 --> 00:58.172
Hey, I'll sign that.

00:58.173 --> 00:59.307
No! I'm first!

00:59.341 --> 01:01.159
Okay...
Boy.

01:01.294 --> 01:04.178
(weepy): You guys are the best

01:50.343 --> 01:53.411
Sammy, when is Woody getting
back from his honeymoon?

01:53.445 --> 01:55.946
I've been working
a double shift for two weeks,

01:55.981 --> 01:57.582
and I'm exhausted.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.467
Oh, thank you. Come again.

02:00.937 --> 02:02.904
Oh, my God, who am I?

02:06.325 --> 02:07.875
Uh-oh. Isn't that Henri,

02:07.876 --> 02:10.511
that jerk who's always trying
to steal Kelly from Woody?

02:10.512 --> 02:12.580
You know, I just
don't like that guy.

02:12.615 --> 02:13.848
Con artist.

02:13.849 --> 02:15.167
Yeah, Mister Frenchie
Two-Face.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.002
Hello, fellows!

02:17.004 --> 02:19.471
Hey, Henri!
How's it going?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.889
Hey, Henri,
what can I do for you?

02:21.891 --> 02:23.708
Uh, I need a favour, Sam.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.994
I need you to tell
the Unemployment Office

02:26.028 --> 02:29.463
that I applied for a job,
and you turned me down.

02:29.549 --> 02:31.265
(laughs) Sammy, come here.

02:31.266 --> 02:32.867
What?
Listen, why don't we hire the guy?

02:32.868 --> 02:34.368
That would help me out a lot.

02:34.402 --> 02:35.912
Oh, I-I don't know
about that.

02:35.938 --> 02:37.589
Henri, did you ever tend bar?

02:37.590 --> 02:38.890
Well, yes, but...
CARLA: You're hired.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.825
No, no,
but you are missing the point.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.527
You are to turn me down

02:42.562 --> 02:44.512
and send me on my way so that

02:44.547 --> 02:47.732
I might spend my afternoon
watching television.

02:47.783 --> 02:49.917
I'm sorry, man,
but I need the help.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.636
Thanks.
(speaks French)

02:51.704 --> 02:54.488
Okay, give me an apron.

02:54.523 --> 02:56.157
Oh, mon dieu.

02:56.191 --> 02:58.026
I am filling Woody's shoes.

02:58.077 --> 02:59.961
Oh, the pressure.

03:01.303 --> 03:05.800
Well, Henri, let me be
your first customer, okay?

03:05.801 --> 03:09.304
I would like a beer, please,
and put it on my tab.

03:09.306 --> 03:12.107
Aren't you supposed
to pay when served?

03:12.141 --> 03:13.441
Well, as long

03:13.442 --> 03:15.978
as we're bringing up the matter
of debt, Frenchie,

03:15.979 --> 03:17.279
let me bring up a
couple little things

03:17.280 --> 03:20.198
called World War I
and World War II, okay?

03:20.200 --> 03:23.484
Now, why don't we
subtract the cost of my puny little beer

03:23.518 --> 03:25.987
from the enormous
debt that you owe us?

03:25.989 --> 03:28.255
Okay, okay.

03:28.256 --> 03:30.842
Hey, uh, you came down pretty
hard on him, didn't you, Norm?

03:30.843 --> 03:32.060
Damn it, Cliffie.

03:32.111 --> 03:35.330
My dad was almost in the army.

03:37.199 --> 03:39.016
(whistling)

03:43.789 --> 03:45.923
(indistinct crowd chatter)

04:00.956 --> 04:02.924
Say, can I bum a cigarette?

04:02.958 --> 04:04.358
Yeah, I got one right...

04:04.393 --> 04:06.428
Oh, God! Sam,
I swear, I swear.

04:06.462 --> 04:07.595
I can't believe you...

04:07.629 --> 04:09.997
No, this is the only
one that I've had!

04:10.032 --> 04:12.550
You promised me you would
not smoke in the office.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.886
We had a little problem
with that, remember?

04:14.920 --> 04:16.120
Ding-a-ling-a-ling.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.822
Whoo! Whoosh!

04:17.822 --> 04:19.673
I know, I know, and
I've tried to quit,

04:19.673 --> 04:21.108
but it's too hard-
I just can't!

04:21.110 --> 04:23.111
Yeah, well, you need
some professional help.

04:23.112 --> 04:24.445
Oh, wait a minute.

04:24.479 --> 04:26.013
Yeah, here we go.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.950
"Smokers Anonymous,"
"Smoke Beaters."

04:28.984 --> 04:31.285
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.188
"Doctor Kluger's
No-Mercy Clinic."

04:34.189 --> 04:35.489
Wait a minute.
Let me see that.

04:35.490 --> 04:36.924
Here we are.

04:36.925 --> 04:38.692
Sam, he doesn't even have
an ad; it's just his name.

04:38.693 --> 04:39.961
How about going with this one

04:39.962 --> 04:42.329
with the cute
little smoking kitty?

04:42.364 --> 04:44.698
Yeah, uh, is this,
uh, Dr. Kluger?

04:44.733 --> 04:47.635
Well, my name's Sam Malone,
and I have an employee

04:47.669 --> 04:50.238
that needs to stop smoking
right this very minute.

04:50.272 --> 04:51.739
Can you help me out?

04:51.774 --> 04:55.109
Yeah, tell me
about your program.

04:55.161 --> 04:56.360
Oh! Ow!

04:56.395 --> 04:58.262
Boy, I bet that hurts, huh?

04:58.331 --> 05:02.183
Wow, I bet you really
have to be a doctor to do that, don't you?

05:02.218 --> 05:05.086
Uh, no, no.
It sounds terrific.

05:05.121 --> 05:06.821
Yes, I can.
All right, great!

05:06.855 --> 05:08.289
Thank you very much.

05:08.324 --> 05:09.624
Sounds good.
Oh, yeah.

05:09.658 --> 05:11.726
I'll fit it in
in my spare time.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.228
Maybe I'll stop by next week.

05:13.229 --> 05:14.496
No, you don't understand, hon.

05:14.497 --> 05:16.664
We got to get you up
to the sidewalk right now.

05:16.665 --> 05:18.666
They're sending
the, uh, Kluger van.

05:18.700 --> 05:19.834
Oh, yeah.
Van?

05:19.868 --> 05:21.318
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Kluger van?

05:21.337 --> 05:22.504
It'll be good for you.

05:22.538 --> 05:23.904
You'll be all right.

05:28.144 --> 05:30.077
(distant phones ringing)

05:32.047 --> 05:34.081
So,

05:34.083 --> 05:37.335
you're the girl
who likes to smoke.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.620
You don't intimidate me.

05:38.654 --> 05:40.855
I've been to a million
of these places,

05:40.889 --> 05:42.056
and they don't work.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.241
I'm out of here.

05:43.275 --> 05:44.475
Oh, well, fine. Go.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.876
You're free to leave.

05:45.911 --> 05:47.211
No doorknob.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.447
(laughs)

05:49.481 --> 05:51.516
Yeah, that's right, Miss Howe.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.269
Because you have the key,
and the key is discipline.

05:55.337 --> 05:56.638
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:56.672 --> 05:58.840
I'm scared.

05:58.841 --> 06:02.110
Why don't you just save
yourself some time

06:02.111 --> 06:03.344
and unlock the door?

06:03.379 --> 06:05.313
Uh... all right,
Miss Howe.

06:05.347 --> 06:07.982
Relax. Have a seat.

06:08.017 --> 06:09.817
(chuckles)

06:09.851 --> 06:11.652
Why don't you have a cigarette?

06:11.686 --> 06:15.123
In fact...

06:15.157 --> 06:19.994
why don't you have,
a thousand cigarettes?

06:25.267 --> 06:27.335
Now...

06:27.420 --> 06:30.521
you are going to smoke

06:30.523 --> 06:32.690
until you can smoke no more.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.559
But I predict you will
not get past 50.

06:35.594 --> 06:38.496
No one has ever gotten past 50.

06:38.597 --> 06:42.349
I had 50 in the van.

06:42.435 --> 06:45.069
Oh, well,

06:45.071 --> 06:49.357
I can see this is going
to be a challenge.

06:49.391 --> 06:52.026
All right, hold my calls.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.971
And so you can
imagine my embarrassment

07:04.006 --> 07:07.241
when I made two dates
for the same night.

07:07.242 --> 07:08.993
Uh, what happened when
your two lovelies arrived?

07:08.994 --> 07:10.128
Was there a cat fight?

07:10.162 --> 07:13.064
Oh please, tell me
there was a cat fight.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.149
Of course.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.750
There was a big cat fight.

07:16.785 --> 07:18.386
They were very, very naughty.

07:18.420 --> 07:21.789
I don't even know why I kept
letting them up on the bed.

07:21.921 --> 07:26.177
Henri, where was the strangest
place that you ever...

07:26.178 --> 07:29.263
Oh, that would have to be, uh,
ah, during a performance

07:29.298 --> 07:31.466
in the balcony
at the Paris Opera.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.401
And believe me,

07:33.403 --> 07:36.737
it wasn't over
until the fat lady sang.

07:36.822 --> 07:38.989
Very impressive.

07:39.074 --> 07:40.308
(chuckles)

07:40.310 --> 07:42.059
And what about you, Sam?

07:42.093 --> 07:44.263
You're supposed to be
a great ladies' man?

07:44.296 --> 07:46.564
All right, let's see,
the strangest place,

07:46.598 --> 07:48.899
that'd have to be,
uh, the back of a car.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.018
Well, that's not so strange.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.688
The car's on an
assembly line, Henri.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.625
You played with me, Sam.

07:57.676 --> 07:59.126
Hey, I like you.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.394
It's nothing personal.

08:00.395 --> 08:02.029
As a matter of fact,
I think of you

08:02.030 --> 08:04.431
as kind of a...
young Sam Malone.

08:04.433 --> 08:08.102
Uh, don't you mean, you're
kind of, uh, an old Henri?

08:08.187 --> 08:10.855
No, I don't.

08:10.856 --> 08:14.225
Well, but why should
we argue the point

08:14.226 --> 08:15.894
when we can settle it in battle?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.645
(chuckling):
What do you mean?

08:17.730 --> 08:20.831
I suggest a little competition.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.466
All right, here's what we do.

08:22.484 --> 08:26.220
We shall collect phone numbers
from beautiful women.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.990
Whoever has the most phone
numbers at midnight

08:29.024 --> 08:32.592
will be acknowledged as the
world's greatest ladies' man.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.844
That's a great idea.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.096
Hey, take him, Sammy!

08:35.097 --> 08:36.381
Yeah, put him in his place.

08:36.381 --> 08:38.582
Don't listen to this.
It's a stupid idea.

08:38.583 --> 08:39.732
HENRI:
Oh...

08:39.751 --> 08:42.318
Do I hear a scaredy-cat's tune?

08:42.337 --> 08:45.072
Would you grow up, Henri?

08:45.090 --> 08:47.959
Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat,
scaredy-cat.

08:47.993 --> 08:49.193
Hey, hey, stop that.

08:49.227 --> 08:50.828
Hey, please, will ya?

08:50.846 --> 08:54.015
Maybe ten years ago I would
have taken this silly bet.

08:54.016 --> 08:56.150
But I'm, I'm older,
and I'm a little wiser.

08:56.151 --> 08:57.918
Oh, well, maybe
you're right, Sam.

08:57.953 --> 09:00.187
Maybe we don't need to compete.

09:00.221 --> 09:03.658
(sighs)
I'll simply be king of ladies' men

09:03.692 --> 09:06.393
and you'd be the mayor
of Scaredy-Cat Town.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.613
You'd better hurry.

09:09.648 --> 09:12.250
I am about to get
my first number.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.618
Yeah, well, he can get
all the numbers he wants.

09:14.619 --> 09:16.369
I'm not going to
stoop to his level.

09:16.388 --> 09:17.554
Bravo, Sam.

09:17.589 --> 09:19.123
You handled that very well.

09:19.124 --> 09:20.825
It's good to see that
you've evolved

09:20.826 --> 09:23.261
beyond the playboy mentality
of bedding every woman you meet.

09:23.262 --> 09:25.362
Times have changed and you've
wisely changed with them.

09:25.363 --> 09:26.597
I applaud that.

09:26.631 --> 09:29.281
Oh, well, I appreciate that.
Thanks. Thanks very much.

09:31.953 --> 09:35.523
Well, the king
of babes is dead.

09:35.557 --> 09:39.327
What the hell are
we supposed to do now?

09:48.570 --> 09:50.287
Norm.
Yeah.

09:50.288 --> 09:52.323
Tell the bartender
I need a vodka-rocks.

09:52.324 --> 09:55.509
Sammy, Carla needs a
vodka-rocks and a beer.

09:58.697 --> 10:02.049
Carla, will you cut it out with
this "tell the bartender" stuff?

10:02.117 --> 10:03.451
It's me, Sam.

10:03.535 --> 10:05.085
Sam is dead.

10:05.086 --> 10:07.839
He died, when he wouldn't take
the challenge from Henri.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.309
You know, that's just childish.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.110
Can we please just talk
about anything

10:13.111 --> 10:14.978
besides this damned bet?

10:14.980 --> 10:17.197
Yeah. Okay, how about this?

10:17.232 --> 10:21.034
What would, uh, Metropolis
be like if Superman retired?

10:22.521 --> 10:25.406
Oops! One thing wrong
with that scenario.

10:25.441 --> 10:28.242
Superman gives a damn.

10:30.195 --> 10:32.446
I've got two more numbers, Sam.

10:32.481 --> 10:34.649
Yeah, well, I'm not
playing, Henri.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.851
You will, Sam, you will.

10:36.852 --> 10:38.385
Yeah? What makes
you think so?

10:38.386 --> 10:40.121
Because I know you, Sam.

10:40.155 --> 10:43.658
Deep down you're a, uh-uh,
babe-hound just as I am.

10:43.692 --> 10:45.392
Admit it.

10:45.426 --> 10:50.230
With every phone
number I catch, you die a little inside.

10:52.333 --> 10:56.971
You can deny what you are to
the others, but not to me.

10:57.005 --> 11:01.942
Come, Sam, come over
to the dark side!

11:05.564 --> 11:09.333
Just go fill
a pretzel bowl, will you?

11:09.367 --> 11:10.768
Okay. Okay.

11:10.803 --> 11:15.172
But after they're filled-
come to the dark side!

11:18.026 --> 11:20.227
Normie, now that Sammy's dead,

11:20.228 --> 11:22.596
you realize we're gonna
have to live vicariously

11:22.597 --> 11:23.831
through Henri?

11:23.866 --> 11:26.500
No, Cliffie.

11:26.534 --> 11:29.970
Just say we stopped living
vicariously through others, huh?

11:30.005 --> 11:33.424
What do you say we get
off our duffs for once,

11:33.425 --> 11:35.893
and live ourselves, so
that some other poor slubs

11:35.894 --> 11:37.662
can live vicariously
through us? Huh?

11:37.663 --> 11:39.129
What do you say we...

11:39.164 --> 11:41.131
(laughs) Oh, shoot!

11:41.166 --> 11:43.467
Damn, I nearly got
through it, too!

11:43.502 --> 11:45.169
You were good.
Yeah.

11:45.203 --> 11:47.104
I thought you were gonna do it!

11:48.590 --> 11:50.358
You are the most
beautiful woman

11:50.392 --> 11:51.776
I have ever seen.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.560
It would make
my life worth living

11:53.561 --> 11:55.262
if only I could have
your phone number.

11:55.263 --> 11:56.647
WOMAN:
Sorry.

11:56.681 --> 11:57.998
Nothing personal.

11:58.033 --> 11:59.543
I just don't like French guys.

12:01.536 --> 12:02.636
Oh...
(coughs)

12:02.637 --> 12:03.971
(with American accent):
Well, uh, that's, uh,

12:03.972 --> 12:05.172
that's just an affectation.

12:05.173 --> 12:06.406
I'm Chuck from Portland.

12:10.162 --> 12:12.796
I-I just figured
you're so sophisticated

12:12.797 --> 12:14.999
that you-you wouldn't
have anything to do

12:15.000 --> 12:16.834
with plain old me.

12:16.868 --> 12:19.637
You should have more
confidence, Chuck.

12:19.671 --> 12:22.556
Maybe this will help
your self-esteem.

12:22.557 --> 12:26.560
(with French accent):
I got another one.

12:26.561 --> 12:28.395
Thank you.

12:30.215 --> 12:31.498
Sammy!

12:31.533 --> 12:33.100
I am thrashing you soundly.

12:33.101 --> 12:34.168
You better hurry!

12:34.169 --> 12:36.270
You'll never catch up!

12:36.304 --> 12:38.105
Look at Sammy
just standing there.

12:38.139 --> 12:40.158
Maybe Henri's right.

12:40.192 --> 12:43.027
Maybe he is a...
(French accent): scaredy-cat.

12:44.145 --> 12:46.446
You guys don't get it, do you?

12:46.481 --> 12:48.281
You know, it's...

12:48.316 --> 12:50.918
I've done all this
babe-chasing stuff.

12:50.919 --> 12:52.453
All right, here-here's
what it is.

12:52.454 --> 12:54.788
It's like- it's like watching
The Three Stooges.

12:54.789 --> 12:55.922
You know?

12:55.923 --> 12:57.625
You watch the early ones
with Curly,

12:57.626 --> 12:58.946
and they-they were magic!

12:58.960 --> 13:01.595
And then- then you watch
the later ones, you know,

13:01.596 --> 13:04.131
where they're using the same
jokes with Curly Joe,

13:04.132 --> 13:06.199
and it just breaks your heart!

13:08.136 --> 13:09.937
See, what I'm saying is...

13:09.971 --> 13:11.271
I guess, you know,

13:11.272 --> 13:13.006
you-you've got to move
with the times.

13:13.007 --> 13:14.392
That's all.

13:14.426 --> 13:18.078
Well, listen to the scaredy-cat
knocking Curly Joe.

13:19.481 --> 13:21.732
I got another one, Sam!

13:21.733 --> 13:23.601
Hey! Hey! The whole issue
is closed, Henri.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.036
I'm not taking the bet.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.321
Oh, very well, I give up.

13:27.356 --> 13:29.790
I won't bother you again.

13:29.825 --> 13:33.327
After all, what can I expect
from an American?

13:33.361 --> 13:35.913
You are all fat, lazy,

13:35.947 --> 13:37.248
stupid.

13:37.282 --> 13:40.501
All you want to do is watch TV,
eat fast food

13:40.535 --> 13:42.587
while your easy women
are scooped up

13:42.621 --> 13:45.139
by handsome foreigners
like myself.

13:45.173 --> 13:48.009
That tears it!

13:48.043 --> 13:50.844
You've just drawn blood
on the US of A, pal!

13:50.845 --> 13:54.265
Cliff, calm down.
Calm down, nothing!

13:54.266 --> 13:56.851
Sammy might be missing
in action,

13:56.885 --> 13:58.819
but on behalf of
this great nation,

13:58.853 --> 14:00.487
I'm gonna go out there

14:00.488 --> 14:01.972
and collect more
telephone numbers

14:01.973 --> 14:03.590
than that sleazy Frenchman!

14:05.477 --> 14:07.745
What about it, men?
Are you with me?

14:07.779 --> 14:10.330
You know,
I'm usually afraid of girls,

14:10.364 --> 14:13.000
but it's for America!

14:14.452 --> 14:15.703
Me, too!

14:15.704 --> 14:16.637
Then let's go!!

14:16.638 --> 14:18.873
Hey, fellows, fellows, fellows!

14:18.907 --> 14:21.408
All right, please,
take your seats.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.881
Okay, Henri, you're on.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.817
Carla, get the babe kit.

14:29.851 --> 14:31.085
(gasps)

14:33.138 --> 14:35.806
Not the babe kit!
Sam, are you sure?!

14:35.840 --> 14:37.108
Yeah.

14:37.142 --> 14:39.310
Oh, but, Sammy,
he's just a kid!

14:39.344 --> 14:40.844
He didn't know!

14:43.765 --> 14:46.400
Maybe it's time
he grew up, Carla.

14:46.434 --> 14:49.103
Oh, but Sammy,
you told me never to get the babe kit!

14:51.289 --> 14:56.727
Henri, you shouldn't have
brought America into this.

14:58.179 --> 15:00.480
Ooh! The babe kit!

15:00.515 --> 15:01.832
I'm shaking!

15:01.866 --> 15:03.584
(laughs)

15:03.618 --> 15:07.004
What is this babe kit?

15:07.038 --> 15:08.171
Tell me.

15:09.307 --> 15:10.925
Tell me!

15:10.959 --> 15:15.646
ALL: Scaredy-cat, scaredy-
cat, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat!

15:15.680 --> 15:17.431
Okay, Carla, I'm ready.

15:17.465 --> 15:19.633
Bring in the kit.

15:26.707 --> 15:28.475
Before you open this thing,

15:28.476 --> 15:30.610
I want you to know
this is a one-shot deal,

15:30.611 --> 15:31.779
tonight only.

15:31.813 --> 15:36.584
In this box
is the Sam Malone I used to be.

15:36.618 --> 15:39.720
Sammy, if you've outgrown
all this stuff,

15:39.754 --> 15:40.871
why do you keep it?

15:40.905 --> 15:44.591
I thought maybe one day
I'd have a son.

15:53.117 --> 15:56.820
(gasps)

15:56.855 --> 16:00.441
Sam! Oh!

16:00.475 --> 16:02.810
Sam!

16:02.844 --> 16:05.578
The first edition of your
little black book.

16:05.613 --> 16:08.081
Yeah.
Oh!

16:08.116 --> 16:09.883
(gasps)

16:09.918 --> 16:12.452
Your Members Only jacket!

16:15.774 --> 16:20.327
Oh, Sammy, a picture
of you and Elvis!

16:20.362 --> 16:22.496
Yeah, yeah.
The chicks really love that.

16:23.999 --> 16:25.632
What kind of cologne is that?

16:25.666 --> 16:27.634
It's a special blend;

16:27.668 --> 16:31.538
Old Spice, Hai Karate
and something that takes spots out.

16:31.572 --> 16:33.940
I'm not really sure.

16:33.975 --> 16:36.477
Well, I'll leave
you to prepare.

16:36.511 --> 16:37.561
Yeah.

16:43.017 --> 16:46.720
Every time I think I'm out,
they pull me back in!

16:56.764 --> 17:00.033
So, I wanted to be an artist.

17:00.067 --> 17:02.970
The old man wouldn't have it.

17:03.004 --> 17:04.704
Off to medical school.

17:04.739 --> 17:07.508
I could never please him.

17:07.541 --> 17:11.011
Aw. Not you, with all
the important work you do?

17:11.045 --> 17:16.316
Well, it was never enough.

17:18.886 --> 17:20.354
You poor, poor man.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.755
Mm.

17:21.756 --> 17:23.723
Oh, watch it.
Don't get ashes on my diploma.

17:23.724 --> 17:24.775
Oh.

17:31.182 --> 17:33.033
Hey, guys!

17:33.067 --> 17:34.819
Hey.
All right, Fras.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.587
Say what's the, uh,
tote board for?

17:36.588 --> 17:38.522
I thought Sam wasn't gonna take
that bet.

17:38.523 --> 17:39.739
Well, he wasn't,

17:39.774 --> 17:42.509
but then Henri turned it
into a big grudge match...

17:42.543 --> 17:44.744
France versus the USA.

17:44.779 --> 17:47.331
At the last hour,
Sam stepped in for our side.

17:47.365 --> 17:48.582
Damn, and I missed it!

17:48.617 --> 17:50.417
I was home teaching
my kid to read!

17:50.452 --> 17:52.186
I could kick myself!

17:54.205 --> 17:55.956
Thanks a lot, sweetheart.

17:55.957 --> 17:57.558
I-I'll give you a
call next week.

17:57.559 --> 17:59.593
You know, I think
the two of us could be

17:59.594 --> 18:00.827
very special
together, Michelle!

18:00.828 --> 18:03.197
Or should I say,
uh, number eight? Yeah!

18:03.231 --> 18:04.281
(bell dings)

18:04.299 --> 18:07.485
ALL (chanting):
USA! USA! USA! USA!

18:07.519 --> 18:08.602
Wait-wait-wait.

18:08.636 --> 18:11.005
Oh, my God!
Is it really you?

18:11.039 --> 18:12.907
Uh, yeah.

18:12.941 --> 18:14.341
Hi.
How long has it been?

18:14.342 --> 18:16.643
Oh I love what you did
with your hair! It's great!

18:16.644 --> 18:17.778
Thank you.

18:17.779 --> 18:19.563
Are you still going
with, uh... Oh, shoot.

18:19.564 --> 18:20.915
Steve?
Yeah. Steve, right.

18:20.949 --> 18:22.249
No, no,

18:22.250 --> 18:24.718
apparently, he wasn't ready
to make a commitment.

18:24.719 --> 18:26.086
Is that Steve or what?

18:26.120 --> 18:27.253
(both laugh)

18:27.288 --> 18:28.488
That's right.

18:28.489 --> 18:29.656
God, you look wonderful!

18:29.657 --> 18:31.926
Hey, give me a hug.
It's great to see you.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.544
Great to see you.

18:33.545 --> 18:34.879
Wait, this is crazy!
This is crazy!

18:34.880 --> 18:36.413
Here, look, give
me your number.

18:36.414 --> 18:38.799
I don't want to lose
touch with you again.

18:38.833 --> 18:43.137
You know, I really meant
to call you a couple of times.

18:43.138 --> 18:44.171
Here.

18:44.172 --> 18:45.472
Well, shame on you for not.

18:45.473 --> 18:48.108
Give me another hug.

18:48.109 --> 18:49.042
All right.

18:49.043 --> 18:51.812
Bye.
Bye-bye. See you later.

18:51.846 --> 18:53.030
Sammy, who was that?

18:53.064 --> 18:56.817
How the hell should I know?

18:56.851 --> 18:59.537
ALL:
USA! USA! USA!

18:59.571 --> 19:01.972
So how many orphans
did you save?

19:02.007 --> 19:07.477
Oh, 15, 16 if you include
their little puppy.

19:07.512 --> 19:10.014
You went back in
to save a puppy?

19:10.048 --> 19:11.815
Well, he was an orphan, too.

19:11.849 --> 19:13.801
Oh!

19:13.835 --> 19:15.553
My card.
HENRI: Oh, thank you.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.120
Uh, could you push
that down for me?

19:17.121 --> 19:18.455
Oh, sure.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.931
How am I doing, Carla?

19:26.965 --> 19:29.817
Well, it's all tied up
with, uh, two minutes left.

19:29.851 --> 19:30.950
No sweat.

19:30.951 --> 19:32.419
Oh, that's what I like to hear.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.605
The old Sammy's back!

19:34.639 --> 19:36.407
Oh!

19:36.408 --> 19:37.407
I can't believe it!

19:37.408 --> 19:41.245
Excuse me, miss, have you seen
a, an Olympic gold medal

19:41.279 --> 19:44.081
from the decathlon?

19:44.115 --> 19:45.265
I hate to lose it.

19:45.299 --> 19:47.334
It was part of a set.

19:47.335 --> 19:48.652
But I'll tell you something,

19:48.653 --> 19:52.706
I would give them all up
for a shot at your phone number.

19:52.740 --> 19:55.025
Look, I find you very amusing

19:55.060 --> 19:57.628
and, uh, I appreciate
all this flattery,

19:57.662 --> 20:00.547
but if this is just some bar
pick-up, I wish you wouldn't.

20:00.581 --> 20:02.933
I'm just coming off
a bad relationship

20:02.967 --> 20:05.552
and I'm very vulnerable
right now.

20:05.586 --> 20:08.772
Oh, well, I'm, uh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that.

20:08.806 --> 20:12.926
Uh, actually, I'm, I'm
not an Olympic athlete.

20:14.312 --> 20:15.696
(softly):
Sam, hurry!

20:15.730 --> 20:19.999
Uh, I'm a secret agent.

20:20.034 --> 20:21.701
Uh... I'm sorry.

20:21.735 --> 20:23.336
You were right the first time.

20:23.371 --> 20:24.604
It's a sleazy bar pick-up.

20:24.638 --> 20:26.073
Yeah.
Forgive me.

20:26.107 --> 20:29.076
It was very childish.

20:29.110 --> 20:30.410
Good luck to you.

20:30.445 --> 20:31.879
Thanks.
Yeah. Sorry.

20:31.913 --> 20:34.131
(clock rings)

20:34.165 --> 20:35.916
Aw, shoot.

20:35.950 --> 20:37.284
I guess Henri wins.

20:37.318 --> 20:39.920
I win! I win!

20:39.954 --> 20:42.673
France has won!
France has won!

20:42.707 --> 20:44.608
There's something
you never hear.

20:49.430 --> 20:51.431
Well, Henri, you won
fair and square.

20:51.465 --> 20:52.683
Congratulations.

20:52.717 --> 20:55.768
Yes, I did, Sam,
and on behalf of Frenchmen everywhere,

20:55.803 --> 20:57.904
let me just say...
(blows raspberry)

20:57.938 --> 20:59.106
(laughs)

20:59.140 --> 21:02.209
Well, thank you.
How very gracious of you.

21:03.177 --> 21:05.112
Shame on you, Sam.
Shame on you!

21:05.146 --> 21:06.779
You threw back the tying babe

21:06.814 --> 21:09.616
just because she
was vulnerable.

21:09.617 --> 21:12.619
The old Sammy would have kept on
pushing till he got the number.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.871
Well, maybe I'm just
not the old Sammy anymore.

21:14.872 --> 21:16.173
No, I guess you're not.

21:16.207 --> 21:17.591
Uh, excuse me.

21:17.625 --> 21:18.758
Yeah?

21:18.793 --> 21:21.011
Listen, I just wanted
to tell you that

21:21.012 --> 21:22.712
I, uh, appreciate you being
such a gentleman back there.

21:22.713 --> 21:23.747
Oh, well...

21:23.748 --> 21:26.266
You know, I don't meet
many men who are like that.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.967
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

21:28.002 --> 21:30.770
Good luck to you.

21:30.771 --> 21:32.839
Hey, what are you doing
later on tonight?

21:32.840 --> 21:36.610
Uh, I thought you wanted
to be alone.

21:36.611 --> 21:38.311
What about all that
vulnerable stuff?

21:38.312 --> 21:40.147
Oh, that was just a line I use

21:40.181 --> 21:42.516
to find out
what kind of man I'm dealing with.

21:42.550 --> 21:46.153
(laughs) Good for you!

21:46.154 --> 21:47.820
Hey, you guys, you
have to meet this guy.

21:47.821 --> 21:49.222
He is such a gentleman.

21:49.257 --> 21:50.657
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

21:50.691 --> 21:52.225
Oh, yeah, and he's cute too.

21:52.260 --> 21:53.494
Oh.

21:53.495 --> 21:54.795
Listen, we're gonna go out.

21:54.796 --> 21:56.246
Do you want to come along?

21:56.280 --> 21:58.415
It's a lot more fun with four.

21:58.449 --> 22:00.083
Yeah.

22:00.084 --> 22:02.202
Look, there's one thing
that you should know.

22:02.203 --> 22:06.223
We do everything together.

22:06.257 --> 22:07.891
Everything?

22:09.811 --> 22:11.178
Everything.

22:11.212 --> 22:13.046
Yeah.
Well!

22:13.080 --> 22:15.115
Ladies, ladies.

22:15.149 --> 22:19.436
Uh, Carla, uh, would you close
the bar for me?

22:19.470 --> 22:22.356
Uh, oh, Henri, uh,
congratulations on that, uh,

22:22.390 --> 22:24.658
that, uh, phone number
thing we were doing.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.360
Okay, ladies,

22:27.394 --> 22:30.247
right foot!
(laughs)

22:32.433 --> 22:34.201
ALL:
USA! USA!

22:34.235 --> 22:35.935
USA!
