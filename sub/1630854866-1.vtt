WEBVTT

00:09.051 --> 00:11.095
<i>Listen.</i>

00:13.556 --> 00:15.266
<i>For ages the homeland
of the fae</i>

00:15.266 --> 00:19.562
<i>remained free until
the empires of men arrived.</i>

00:19.562 --> 00:22.356
<i>In the midst of that conflict,</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:25.151
<i>two souls found
an unexpected love.</i>

00:25.151 --> 00:26.527
It's that Pix
you've been doting on.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.362
I'm not the only one
with a secret, am I?

00:28.362 --> 00:30.322
<i>She'll die for you.</i>

00:30.322 --> 00:31.699
She loves you.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.075
I've seen what's coming.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.660
If you love her,

00:34.660 --> 00:36.954
you won't give her
the choice to.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.176
 <i>Where to, Inspector?</i>

00:50.176 --> 00:52.803
 <i>The Row, as we have
a killer on the loose.</i>

00:52.803 --> 00:55.848
<i>Ladies who found her
said she was Aisling Querelle.</i>

00:55.848 --> 00:57.516
<i>She was taken
by a great evil.</i>

00:57.516 --> 01:00.227
<i>Neither man nor fae.</i>

01:01.437 --> 01:02.730
<i>Why do you care
so bloody much?</i>

01:02.730 --> 01:05.858
What's this strange affinity
you have for 'em?

01:05.858 --> 01:07.943
You know you don't have
to come here every day.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.821
Could've just as easily been me
behind them bars instead of you.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.116
Darius!

01:14.116 --> 01:15.576
<i>You okay?</i>

01:15.576 --> 01:16.744
I'm fine.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.915
All right, I'm all yours.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.503
Stop her,
you maggots!

01:31.467 --> 01:33.385
<i>Name.</i>

01:33.385 --> 01:35.596
Vignette. Vignette Stonemoss.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.680
<i>Tourmaline.</i>

01:38.224 --> 01:39.517
Gods, you don't know, do you?

01:39.517 --> 01:40.768
Know what?

01:42.812 --> 01:43.896
You're alive.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.481
I never meant to hurt you.

01:45.481 --> 01:48.108
You destroyed me.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.360
I can't go back
to that fucking house.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.778
You won't let me work here.

01:50.778 --> 01:51.946
What else is there?

01:51.946 --> 01:54.156
They call themselves
the Black Raven.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.659
The law of the city is not ours.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.661
It does not protect us.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.704
Just tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.209
<i>I will never
forgive myself</i>

02:05.209 --> 02:07.503
if this Black Raven shit
gets you killed.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.300
Where have you been?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.844
<i>Not on Carnival Row, I trust?</i>

02:14.844 --> 02:16.011
<i>Well, of course not.</i>

02:16.011 --> 02:18.305
You're the chancellor's son, Jonah.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.058
<i>You can't give your father's
enemies any ammunition.</i>

02:21.058 --> 02:22.351
<i>Who's that?</i>

02:22.351 --> 02:23.853
<i>Longerbane's daughter Sophie.</i>

02:23.853 --> 02:28.274
A great tide of anger
is rising in this city.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.651
Its good people
have had enough!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.737
You're Jonah Breakspear.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.030
Suppose it was inevitable
that our paths

02:35.030 --> 02:36.448
would cross sooner or later.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.618
I've been brought in
to tutor you.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.329
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.747
<i>Don't think</i>

02:43.747 --> 02:47.751
you can pay me to lie for you.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.713
Is the master of the house
available?

02:50.713 --> 02:52.131
I'm master here.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.552
<i>I sensed that you lack</i>

02:56.552 --> 02:58.637
a proper invitation
to society here.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.390
And you smelled a bargain
to be made.

03:03.225 --> 03:06.061
There must be a limit
to what he can ask of you!

03:06.061 --> 03:07.605
Of course.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.815
You are quite unlike anyone

03:09.815 --> 03:12.067
<i>I've ever met, Mr. Agreus.</i>

03:12.818 --> 03:14.236
Get out of the bed.

03:18.782 --> 03:19.950
Imogen.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.952
Agreus, we have to go,
we have to leave now.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.204
- We're being signaled.
- Ignore them.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.789
Let them chase us
if they'd like.

03:25.789 --> 03:26.790
<i>What course
shall we set?</i>

03:26.790 --> 03:28.125
<i>Somewhere far away.</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:45.601
I know who you are.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.520
Is she still alive?

03:48.520 --> 03:51.148
Time is running out. Go.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.693
<i>Your scars.</i>

03:55.945 --> 03:56.946
You're half fae.

03:56.946 --> 03:58.030
<i>I still can't
believe it.</i>

03:58.030 --> 03:59.406
A half-blood.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.991
Passing right under our noses.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.034
Bring him in.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.661
<i>Rycroft Philostrate,</i>

04:03.661 --> 04:05.204
you're under arrest.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.665
Do you ever think
about Tirnanoc?

04:08.791 --> 04:09.667
<i>All the time.</i>

04:11.001 --> 04:12.962
I wish I'd never left.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.382
Wait.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.342
<i>I didn't kill
my mother.</i>

04:18.342 --> 04:19.802
I didn't even know who she was.

04:19.802 --> 04:23.055
I can ask you, Father.

04:23.055 --> 04:24.556
You're not Krik.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.813
<i>I've decided
that I'm no longer in need</i>

04:30.813 --> 04:31.814
<i>of an arts and letters tutor.</i>

04:31.814 --> 04:33.107
<i>I understand, sir.</i>

04:33.107 --> 04:35.025
But I am in need
of an honest man.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.443
Sir?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.445
Special advisor
to the chancellor.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.197
Thank you.

04:40.197 --> 04:41.907
<i>Honorable leader
of the opposition,</i>

04:41.907 --> 04:44.118
- will you stand with me?
- I will.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.245
<i>- You have
to go back to the Row.
- Why?</i>

04:46.245 --> 04:48.580
All Critch are to be sequestered
to the Row.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.124
Just Critch, mate, move along.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.625
I am Critch.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.355
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah. What was it?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.024
I don't know.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.734
Something moving.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.613
Ah...

06:02.613 --> 06:04.698
It's just pigeons, mate.
Come on.

06:43.821 --> 06:46.824
All right! All right!

06:46.824 --> 06:50.077
Pipe down, you horrible lot!

06:50.077 --> 06:54.039
Your Uncle Boz has got a
special treat for you tonight.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.294
Who wants to see a fucking
copper get what's coming to him?

07:01.338 --> 07:04.550
I give you Rycroft

07:04.550 --> 07:07.636
Philostrate!

07:07.636 --> 07:09.680
You fucking copper!

07:14.935 --> 07:17.521
Well, hold on. Hold on a bit.

07:17.521 --> 07:21.275
Our champions here are worn out.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.152
Wouldn't be fair to make them
fight a copper

07:23.152 --> 07:25.529
all by themselves,
now, would it?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.082
A fucking Trow? That wasn't
part of the agreement.

07:37.082 --> 07:40.586
No. But technically
within the rules.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.422
And those still apply
to you, copper.

07:43.422 --> 07:47.885
But if you're feeling fragile,
you can forfeit.

07:47.885 --> 07:51.263
Come on.
What's it gonna be, then?

07:51.263 --> 07:54.433
Fight or flight?

07:54.433 --> 07:56.310
[chanting] Fight! Fight!

07:56.310 --> 07:58.604
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

08:47.236 --> 08:48.695
Oi!

08:55.327 --> 08:56.495
Vignette!

08:59.748 --> 09:01.667
You all right?

09:01.667 --> 09:03.752
Come on, then.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.775
Stop! Don't you move.

09:27.734 --> 09:28.568
Aah!

09:43.375 --> 09:45.043
Aah!

09:45.043 --> 09:47.212
Oi, slag!

09:47.212 --> 09:49.381
Fucking half-blood.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.055
Up here!

09:57.055 --> 09:58.849
Hurry!

09:59.891 --> 10:02.144
- It's the Black Raven!
- We have to stop her.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.189
Don't let her get away!
Shoot her.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.611
Aah!

10:15.449 --> 10:17.451
Aah!

10:37.554 --> 10:40.682
- There's more over here.
- Take as much as you can carry.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.691
I'll check the next car.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.498
Critch cunt!

11:05.874 --> 11:07.793
You cowardly little
piece of shite.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.295
- Don't.
- He was gonna shoot me
in the back.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.090
We agreed. No killing.

11:13.090 --> 11:15.175
Phaedra.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.521
Fucking claw him, Geza!

11:31.316 --> 11:33.193
Oh, fuck!

11:33.193 --> 11:35.070
Yeah!

11:35.070 --> 11:36.363
You
fucking wank!

11:41.785 --> 11:43.870
Aah!

12:07.436 --> 12:11.064
You'll pay up. Fair's fair.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.699
We didn't bet for money.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.580
Take the guilders and piss off.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.919
We had a deal.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.880
Deal was...

12:34.880 --> 12:36.923
if I won, you do me a favor.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.718
A special favor.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.179
Or does Boz Ghaidos

12:42.179 --> 12:44.723
welch on his deals now?!

12:44.723 --> 12:47.809
All right, all right.
Show's over.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.520
Uh, Philostrate is the winner.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.066
And I'll honor our agreement.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.986
Fair's fair.

12:57.986 --> 13:01.490
Tomorrow at noon,
Former Inspector.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.012
Stay still!

15:34.517 --> 15:36.269
What do you think Dahlia will do
when she finds out

15:36.269 --> 15:37.687
we went raiding
without her say-so?

15:37.687 --> 15:40.273
Don't know. I was concentrating
on not dying.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.275
- She's not gonna like it.
- You know what?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.902
I don't give a damn
what Dahlia likes.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.320
People are in pain,
they need medicine,

15:45.320 --> 15:46.571
we went out and got it.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.115
She wants to make a fuss
about that, fuck her.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.326
Right. We did the right thing.

15:51.326 --> 15:54.037
She'll understand.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.455
I'll take it to her.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.711
I, uh,

16:42.711 --> 16:44.546
I have to get back.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.674
Sorry, I... I'm sorry.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.805
You did good work today, girl.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.640
Not good enough.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.268
A few bags of anodyne
can't cure the Bás Dubh, can it?

16:58.268 --> 17:00.353
It eases their suffering.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.355
For today, that's enough.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.441
How many more of them came in?

17:04.441 --> 17:07.235
Five since yesterday.

17:07.235 --> 17:10.029
You Pix don't take well
to these conditions, do you?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.531
Well, we're meant to fly.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.950
Not wallow in the shite
like a bunch of leggers.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.413
Saving your presence.

17:18.413 --> 17:21.624
It's a small mercy this sickness
only touches your people.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.960
If it were the fauns
who were suffering,

17:23.960 --> 17:26.588
you'd tend to us. I know it.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.798
- No. No.
- Come on.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.384
Poor souls.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.803
She's his chosen?

17:33.803 --> 17:37.682
Kaine and Oona chose each other
along with three others.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.893
A month ago, the five of them
were talking about

17:39.893 --> 17:41.686
how many children they'd have.

17:41.686 --> 17:44.481
You're such a pain in my ass.
You know that?

17:44.481 --> 17:45.774
You too.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.901
Now there's only two left.

17:49.903 --> 17:52.489
Once Oona's gone,
Kaine will be alone.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.201
I heard you did
a bit of flying last night.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.410
How you doing?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.454
I'm fine, I'm fine.

17:59.454 --> 18:02.373
Except for my friends
doing raids without me.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.460
Soon. When you're better.

18:05.460 --> 18:09.297
Good. It's miserable in here.

18:09.297 --> 18:13.134
Lying about, nothing to do.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.845
She won't take them.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.056
What? Why?

18:18.056 --> 18:21.226
Because, in case
you've forgotten,

18:21.226 --> 18:22.769
I'm a Black Raven.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.354
So I can stand a bit of pain

18:24.354 --> 18:25.980
when there ain't enough medicine
to go around.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.400
I'm hardly the worst off here.
I'll be fine.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.240
If either of you even
think about calling me brave,

18:35.240 --> 18:36.658
I shall smack you.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.118
Love, have mercy.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.037
We've had a long night.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.789
We robbed a train, you know.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.375
All right.

18:45.375 --> 18:48.169
I'll leave you be.

18:48.169 --> 18:50.255
For now.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.397
You all right?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.816
Couple of scratches, that's all.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.735
Oh, but you got worse.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.321
- Look at you.
- I got what I was after.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.656
If Darius knew
what you were doing for him...

19:58.656 --> 20:00.325
I owe him.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.453
You done
with the fighting, then?

20:03.453 --> 20:05.622
If Boz keeps his word.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.373
You got the medicine?

20:18.134 --> 20:20.345
So we're both done, then.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.639
Oh, that medicine
won't last a week.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.768
And there's another
supply train in two days.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.394
They'll be ready for you
if you try again.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.104
I don't like that.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.067
How many Pix came here
because I told them

20:34.067 --> 20:36.152
we'd be safe in the Burgue?

20:38.196 --> 20:39.739
The world's falling apart
and I can't just

20:39.739 --> 20:42.158
sit at home and do nothing.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.077
I know.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.080
Good.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.623
Now, if you don't mind,

20:48.623 --> 20:51.834
I could do with a bath.

20:51.834 --> 20:53.419
Yeah.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.213
I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

20:55.213 --> 20:57.799
Ah, fuck off.
You need one more than me.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.467
- Yeah, probably.
- No, honestly,

20:59.467 --> 21:01.761
you really do stink.
Go on, get in there.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.347
Ladies first.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.807
Hm.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.902
These wings
won't wash themselves.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.137
Please, please don't.

21:44.137 --> 21:47.515
My home. My home.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.225
This is
an absolute outrage.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.144
You can't take it all, surely.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.940
How are we going to live?

22:05.825 --> 22:08.745
My friends,

22:08.745 --> 22:12.874
you came here today
to witness justice being done.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.251
Yes, justice!

22:15.251 --> 22:17.253
I stand before you

22:17.253 --> 22:19.756
not just as your chancellor...

22:19.756 --> 22:21.424
but as a grieving son.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.144
These are the Puck

22:33.144 --> 22:36.397
who killed Absalom
and Piety Breakspear.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.275
My parents.

22:57.919 --> 23:00.671
My father was a great man.

23:00.671 --> 23:03.883
A generous and civilized man.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.510
Like so many of us,

23:05.510 --> 23:09.889
he welcomed Critch refugees
into his city.

23:09.889 --> 23:13.184
Even into his home.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.852
He gave them food,

23:14.852 --> 23:18.189
work and shelter.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.650
He believed
in the fundamental decency

23:20.650 --> 23:22.068
of every living being.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.528
And his kindness

23:23.528 --> 23:27.156
was repaid
with treachery and murder.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.533
Bloody dog, you!

23:38.417 --> 23:40.002
These Critch extremists

23:40.002 --> 23:42.213
took my mother
and father from me.

23:43.256 --> 23:46.134
But they took
something more from you.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.553
They took your chancellor.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.597
A great leader.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.808
And his wife,

23:53.808 --> 23:56.144
my mother,

23:56.144 --> 23:58.146
the gentle heart of our nation.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.272
I couldn't have
killed your mother.

23:59.272 --> 24:00.773
- I was in prison!
- She was a loving

24:00.773 --> 24:02.984
- wife and mother
who never harmed anyone.
- Jonah, you know

24:02.984 --> 24:04.110
this can't be true!

24:04.110 --> 24:05.069
She was murdered.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.779
- Brutally.
- Oh, Hidden One,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.990
reveal yourself
to your servants.

24:08.990 --> 24:12.368
The Martyr only knows
what was done with her body.

24:12.368 --> 24:14.954
I am unable even
to lay her to rest.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.793
As a grieving son,
as my father's son,

24:20.793 --> 24:23.880
my instinct is
to try to understand,

24:23.880 --> 24:25.756
to answer savagery
with mercy.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.967
Show mercy, please.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.971
But as chancellor,
it is my duty to uphold the law.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.266
- No!
- To protect
our precious nation.

24:35.266 --> 24:37.268
- Right! Go on!
- To send a-a message

24:37.268 --> 24:39.812
to any Critch
considering sedition.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.731
Do you still get your jollies
on the Row?

24:41.731 --> 24:43.941
We are a nation
under attack,

24:43.941 --> 24:45.443
from within and without.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.778
Hey! Tell them
about that Pix you f...

25:14.764 --> 25:16.933
Yes! Come on!

25:16.933 --> 25:18.935
Come on!
Rip their horns off!

25:18.935 --> 25:20.144
Fucking animals!

25:20.144 --> 25:21.979
They abduct our women!

25:23.731 --> 25:26.776
They take our women, Chancellor!

25:34.909 --> 25:38.287
My father was forgiving.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.040
And it cost him his life.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.126
His son will not make
the same mistake.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.588
Long live the chancellor!

25:47.588 --> 25:49.507
[chanting] Long live
the chancellor!

25:49.507 --> 25:51.634
Long live the chancellor!

26:04.855 --> 26:07.775
Chancellor, a moment, if I may.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.987
- What now, Mr. Millworthy?
- Strong words back there.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.739
Your father would've
been, um...

26:15.741 --> 26:18.244
...well,

26:18.244 --> 26:20.705
I was just wondering
if you'd had time to consider

26:20.705 --> 26:23.291
the conversation
we had yesterday.

26:23.291 --> 26:26.919
No. I have not had time.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.255
The Pact ambassador
arrives tomorrow.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.216
Critch terrorists are
getting bolder by the day.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.051
A gang of them just robbed
a cargo train.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.970
I-I have not slept
properly in weeks.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.264
And now I'm ordering
heads sliced off

26:38.264 --> 26:40.599
in the slim hope
of sending a message.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.976
I'm in no mood
for another lecture.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.185
No, no. No lecture.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.812
Uh, I just want to let you know

26:44.812 --> 26:46.230
that arrangements
have been made...

26:46.230 --> 26:48.357
Enough!
I'm not making any sort of

26:48.357 --> 26:50.401
official visit to the Row.

26:50.401 --> 26:53.404
Well, with respect,
the guards have been working

26:53.404 --> 26:55.239
without respite
for several weeks.

26:55.239 --> 26:58.284
So, u-uh, just a short visit
from their chancellor,

26:58.284 --> 27:00.995
it would boost morale.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.260
Obviously, Mr. Millworthy,

27:16.260 --> 27:18.804
I'm not a clever fellow
like you.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.640
But if I were
a clever fellow,

27:21.640 --> 27:23.601
I'd wonder if this
was all a ruse of yours

27:23.601 --> 27:25.227
to get me to the Row

27:25.227 --> 27:27.563
so I could see the conditions
there for myself.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.982
And perhaps even be moved
to change my mind.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.984
- Hmm?
- No.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.402
No, that would be absurd.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.822
Um, there's absolutely
no intention of, um...

27:36.822 --> 27:38.115
- No?
- No.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.285
Good.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.705
If there's a problem
with morale,

27:44.705 --> 27:47.208
give the men
a double brandy ration.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.274
- Tourmaline.
- Ah.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.694
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.780
Good. I still got
a little pile stashed away,

28:17.780 --> 28:20.950
so, you know, I'll manage.

28:20.950 --> 28:22.660
And it seems you found new work.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.912
Stone's throw away
from the old one, no less.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.747
Teaching the little ones
to read.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.290
Doesn't pay as much
as the old work,

28:28.290 --> 28:29.959
but what can you do,

28:29.959 --> 28:32.002
with all the culls
the other side of the wall?

28:32.002 --> 28:34.839
Mm. I wonder
if they're missing us.

28:34.839 --> 28:37.633
- Wankers.
- "Wankers" is the right word.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.845
Excuse... Sorry.

28:40.845 --> 28:42.930
Do you m...

29:09.165 --> 29:10.749
What is this all about?

29:10.749 --> 29:11.876
It's a present.

29:11.876 --> 29:14.462
A gift from the chancellor.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.338
To the fine people of the Row.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.590
That's disgusting!

29:17.590 --> 29:20.092
You can't come in...

29:20.092 --> 29:21.594
"Can't," is it?

29:21.594 --> 29:23.512
Don't you "can't" me, Critch.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.893
Please...

29:28.893 --> 29:33.439
Officer, our children have
no business seeing this.

29:36.692 --> 29:40.529
Look, missus,
if you've got any complaints,

29:40.529 --> 29:44.241
if any of you have got
any complaints,

29:44.241 --> 29:46.327
you can go talk to him about it.

30:01.550 --> 30:02.885
Longerbane...

30:02.885 --> 30:04.720
We are still being
ordered about

30:04.720 --> 30:06.514
by a chit of a girl, Marlow.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.390
I won't stand for it.

30:08.390 --> 30:09.600
It's been three months

30:09.600 --> 30:11.602
since Longerbane
went to the Martyr.

30:11.602 --> 30:13.103
She'll be out of mourning soon.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.980
Just in time
for a leadership election.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.690
- You'll see.
- Damn right.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.692
Planning to throw
your hat in the ring?

30:18.692 --> 30:22.363
If young Breakspear's policies
don't ruin us all first.

30:22.363 --> 30:24.657
Someone's got to stop him.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.492
A steady hand at the tiller.

30:26.492 --> 30:30.120
When all's said and done,
politics is a man's job.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.498
The mewling brat will probably
be glad to go back

30:32.498 --> 30:34.875
to playing with her dollies.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.640
Chancellor,
I must insist

30:49.640 --> 30:51.767
we discuss the new tariffs.

30:51.767 --> 30:55.062
Our ports cannot sustain
this additional taxation.

30:56.105 --> 30:57.565
Gentlemen, may I have a moment

30:57.565 --> 30:59.191
with the leader
of the opposition?

30:59.191 --> 31:01.402
Sure you don't need
a chaperone, sir?

31:01.402 --> 31:03.279
She looks ready
to hit you with her handbag.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.948
Thank you, Winetrout,
I'm sure I'll manage.

31:18.752 --> 31:22.131
You handled yourself brilliantly.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.716
And dishonestly.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.843
Those Puck didn't kill
my parents.

31:25.843 --> 31:28.512
Well, they certainly
intended to.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.932
It was grubby, Sophie.
I felt like a swine.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.101
It was a show of strength.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.520
A decisive one.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.856
And well-timed.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.400
The Pact ambassador
will be here tomorrow...

31:41.400 --> 31:43.861
...and there are
already whispers

31:43.861 --> 31:45.613
amongst both our parties.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.448
Whispers?

31:47.448 --> 31:50.409
Neither of us is safe, Jonah.
You know that.

31:50.409 --> 31:54.204
We inherited our seats,
not our power.

31:54.204 --> 31:56.206
Once the mourning period
has passed,

31:56.206 --> 31:58.834
my party will challenge
my leadership.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.836
And so will yours.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.921
Perhaps they ought to.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.007
I never asked for any of this.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.012
Do you believe you can yet
become a greater man

32:10.012 --> 32:12.765
than your father? I do.

32:12.765 --> 32:16.477
I should never have told you
about that damned prophecy.

32:16.477 --> 32:19.688
Besides, I'm not
his real son, am I?

32:19.688 --> 32:22.149
Absalom Breakspear
was your father.

32:22.149 --> 32:23.567
In every way that mattered.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.653
You sound just like my mother!

32:31.617 --> 32:35.162
There is greatness
in you, Jonah.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.830
I see it.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.751
And so will
the rest of them.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.253
When you're ready.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.814
Keep moving.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.565
Ah.

33:03.565 --> 33:05.025
Beg your pardon, sir.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.277
Uh, chancellor's man.
Let him pass.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.405
Thank you.

33:31.385 --> 33:32.970
Let me help you.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.805
Ah, thank you.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.598
There you go.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.274
Hello.

33:45.274 --> 33:48.777
Mr. Erodan.
Pleasure to see you again.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.793
No! Wait.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.255
No!

34:12.926 --> 34:15.012
Philo.

34:16.764 --> 34:19.141
- He's not coming.
- I tried.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.143
If he could see for himself

34:21.143 --> 34:23.103
the damage
his policies are doing...

34:23.103 --> 34:26.148
He'd have a sudden
change of heart?

34:26.148 --> 34:28.233
It's a bit late for that.

34:28.233 --> 34:31.236
Your half brother is still
capable of doing good.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.571
If I didn't know any better,

34:32.571 --> 34:34.615
I'd say you actually
like the cunt.

34:34.615 --> 34:38.368
Men can change, Philo, and
I still hold out hope for him.

34:38.368 --> 34:41.205
No. We have to do something.

34:41.205 --> 34:44.041
All right. Well,
what have you got in mind?

34:44.041 --> 34:46.919
He's only in the job 'cause he's
Breakspear's eldest son, right?

34:46.919 --> 34:49.922
Except he's not, is he?

34:49.922 --> 34:51.799
I am.

34:58.430 --> 35:02.184
You're not telling me
you're gonna make this public?

35:02.184 --> 35:04.061
You're insane, Philo.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.063
No one will believe you.
And besides, they'd never elect

35:06.063 --> 35:08.106
a half-Pix bastard
as Chancellor.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.608
Of course.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.943
But the scandal...

35:10.943 --> 35:13.237
That'll destroy him.

35:13.237 --> 35:14.655
Whoever comes next
can hardly be worse.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.323
Well, I wouldn't put
a bet on that.

35:16.323 --> 35:20.661
Outing yourself, Philo,
is suicidally foolish.

35:20.661 --> 35:22.621
It's deranged, it...

35:27.459 --> 35:30.128
All right.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.047
Have you decided how
you're gonna do this?

35:32.047 --> 35:34.883
I'm open to suggestions.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.219
Well, there is only
one possible solution.

35:37.219 --> 35:39.555
That is, to make it public
with the right audience.

35:39.555 --> 35:42.015
So...

35:42.015 --> 35:44.268
Oh.

35:44.268 --> 35:46.353
Martyr.

35:47.563 --> 35:49.314
There's a state banquet

35:49.314 --> 35:50.983
in honor of the Pact ambassador.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.276
- When?
- Tomorrow.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.697
You'll help?

35:56.697 --> 35:59.449
I don't want you getting
in trouble on my account.

35:59.449 --> 36:02.286
I'm already in trouble.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.037
At least this way
I get to choose

36:04.037 --> 36:06.164
what kind of trouble I'm in.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.710
Tomorrow, then.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.927
Here ya are!

36:28.020 --> 36:29.730
Hurry, hurry. Let's go!

36:30.939 --> 36:33.859
All you got to do
is touch the door.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.485
What are you so afraid of?

36:35.485 --> 36:38.030
- I ain't afraid.
- Then do it.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.907
No!

36:39.907 --> 36:42.242
Do it, do it, do it!

38:02.447 --> 38:04.700
Come back here,
you randy little maggot.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.202
I'm going home to my wife.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.538
I am your wife, you daft sod.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.488
Where have you been, then?

38:44.698 --> 38:47.576
Busy. What's it to you?

38:47.576 --> 38:49.119
Well, Dahlia's away,

38:49.119 --> 38:51.246
and the others want
to honor you...

38:51.246 --> 38:53.290
with <i>deagh-nós.</i>

38:53.290 --> 38:55.292
Fuck off.

38:55.292 --> 38:57.502
The train made us heroes,

38:57.502 --> 38:59.296
and it was your idea.

38:59.296 --> 39:01.673
You deserve it.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.134
Me? <i>Deagh-nós?</i>

39:04.134 --> 39:06.136
Dahlia would never allow it.

39:06.136 --> 39:08.972
Well, like I said,
she's not here.

39:08.972 --> 39:12.559
And when it's done,
she can't take it back.

39:12.559 --> 39:13.560
So...

39:13.560 --> 39:16.271
you want our respect or not?

39:42.631 --> 39:44.674
<i>Morr meach mite.</i>

39:45.717 --> 39:47.719
<i>Morr meach mite.</i>

39:49.763 --> 39:51.765
<i>Morr meach mite.</i>

39:52.808 --> 39:55.477
<i>Morr meach mite.</i>

39:58.146 --> 40:01.691
<i>Morr meach mite.</i>

40:08.115 --> 40:11.993
<i>Morr meach mite.</i>

40:14.204 --> 40:16.456
Go behind my back again,

40:16.456 --> 40:19.376
and I'll clip your wings,
you little cunt.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.378
Try me.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.228
Stay still!

40:38.228 --> 40:39.479
It hurts.

40:39.479 --> 40:40.605
Yeah, well, that's what you get

40:40.605 --> 40:41.815
for joining the Black Raven.

40:41.815 --> 40:43.650
Nobody forced you.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.110
You made the introduction.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.903
Yes, because you asked.

40:48.196 --> 40:50.824
Funny way to show respect,
isn't it?

40:50.824 --> 40:53.660
Ritual torture. Still...

40:53.660 --> 40:55.662
if that's their idea
of a good time,

40:55.662 --> 40:57.247
I'm not judging them.

40:57.247 --> 40:58.623
Yes, you are.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.712
All right, maybe a little bit.

41:03.712 --> 41:06.673
So, what's your idea of
a good time these days?

41:06.673 --> 41:10.385
- Hmm?
- I mean...

41:10.385 --> 41:13.763
I just feel like I haven't
seen you in ages.

41:16.641 --> 41:21.479
Do you ever get that sort of
sick feeling

41:21.479 --> 41:23.773
that something really,
really awful is gonna happen?

41:23.773 --> 41:27.277
Mm. Mm.

41:27.277 --> 41:31.072
Yeah, like what Philo's gonna
do to me when he sees this.

41:31.072 --> 41:33.950
Yeah, precisely.

41:33.950 --> 41:38.246
Sorry. I didn't mean
to be an ass rack.

41:38.246 --> 41:41.333
Come on, what's the story?

41:41.333 --> 41:46.046
Oh, you know, just standard
doom, gloom and inner torment.

41:46.046 --> 41:48.506
You're done.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.134
Are you all right?

41:51.134 --> 41:54.721
Me? Right as rain.

41:54.721 --> 41:56.014
Hmm.

41:57.432 --> 42:01.019
In case you forgot,
I can read you like a book.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.647
So tell me what's wrong
or I'm gonna worry.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.234
I'm not the one robbing trains,
so maybe you should focus

42:07.234 --> 42:09.236
that worry on yourself.

42:10.654 --> 42:12.864
Mm.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.660
Another round?

42:16.660 --> 42:19.204
Uh...

42:19.204 --> 42:22.374
It's a bit late for me.
Some other time, maybe.

42:24.626 --> 42:27.379
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:02.474 --> 44:08.188
<i>Morr faélar isteag mit.</i>

44:29.793 --> 44:35.757
<i>Morr faélar
isteag mit.</i>

44:46.017 --> 44:47.769
Oi, Anders!

44:47.769 --> 44:49.729
All right.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.481
On my way.

45:05.120 --> 45:06.621
What's the matter with you?

45:06.621 --> 45:07.664
Sorry? Wh-What?

45:07.664 --> 45:10.041
- My cat!
- What?

45:10.041 --> 45:12.627
Why would you do that?

45:14.629 --> 45:18.675
I-I don't know...

45:28.351 --> 45:30.687
- What the fuck?
- Rycroft Philostrate?

45:30.687 --> 45:32.689
- Yes?
- You're coming with us.

45:32.689 --> 45:36.192
- And what's the charge?
- Being a fucking Critch.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.224
Open the gate!

46:15.440 --> 46:17.859
Thank you, lads.
You can go.

46:19.277 --> 46:21.154
It's nice to see you again...

46:21.154 --> 46:23.239
Inspector.

46:24.657 --> 46:26.993
Sorry about
the rough-and-tumble.

46:28.036 --> 46:30.788
No. No, you know me, Berwick.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.041
I love a surprise.

46:33.041 --> 46:34.626
No fuckin' way.

46:34.626 --> 46:36.920
Have you lost your damn mind?

46:36.920 --> 46:40.131
If you'll excuse us.

46:40.131 --> 46:42.175
You filthy Critch lover.

46:42.175 --> 46:45.303
Always a pleasure
to see you, lads.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.138
So, what's this all about, then?

46:47.138 --> 46:48.973
We're in a bit of a spot.

46:48.973 --> 46:52.602
- Thought maybe you could help.
- With what?

46:52.602 --> 46:56.147
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's leave them to it.

47:03.488 --> 47:05.114
Well, that's a new one.

47:05.114 --> 47:06.741
Barbed wire.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.117
Flywire.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.411
Same we've got covering the Row.

47:10.411 --> 47:14.123
Victim was Lieutenant Anders
of the Fifth Engineers.

47:14.123 --> 47:16.626
- Heard of him?
- Should I have?

47:16.626 --> 47:18.670
He was stationed
on a supply train

47:18.670 --> 47:21.130
that got robbed last night.

47:21.130 --> 47:22.966
Is that so?

47:22.966 --> 47:25.677
Whoever it was
must have remembered his face

47:25.677 --> 47:27.762
and come back to finish the job.

47:27.762 --> 47:30.974
Only one type of Critch I know
that could fly him up there.

47:30.974 --> 47:33.017
You think a Pix did this?

47:33.017 --> 47:35.645
Black Raven, to be specific.

47:35.645 --> 47:37.438
Who else?

47:37.438 --> 47:39.566
They're rubbing our faces in it.

47:39.566 --> 47:41.693
Laughing at us.

47:41.693 --> 47:42.902
Could be.

47:42.902 --> 47:44.487
Could well be.

47:44.487 --> 47:46.114
But what for?

47:46.114 --> 47:49.450
You're the proper inspector.
You tell me.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.869
What's your game, then,

47:51.869 --> 47:54.163
- bringing me in here?
- No game.

47:54.163 --> 47:57.250
They kicked you out
because of what you are.

47:57.250 --> 48:01.254
But to my mind, what you are is
a brilliant inspector.

48:01.254 --> 48:03.256
Best I've ever worked with.

48:03.256 --> 48:05.258
That's all that matters, to me.

48:05.258 --> 48:07.135
If I turn snitch,

48:07.135 --> 48:09.596
how long do you think I'd last
in the Row?

48:09.596 --> 48:11.889
Well, I heard
you can hold your own.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.309
You used to wear that uniform.

48:14.309 --> 48:16.102
Sorry, Berwick.

48:16.102 --> 48:18.855
- There's a wife, and two kids.
- I can't help you.

48:18.855 --> 48:20.648
If we don't find out
who did this,

48:20.648 --> 48:22.525
the army will start
cracking heads on the Row.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.444
And there's nothing I can do
to stop them.

48:24.444 --> 48:27.071
Since when did you care
about the fae?

48:27.071 --> 48:30.074
Since someone I care about
became one.

48:31.117 --> 48:34.912
You have got to be
fucking joking.

48:37.790 --> 48:39.626
What is he doing here?

48:39.626 --> 48:42.670
He's the only eyes and ears
we got their side of the wall.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.756
"We"? He's fucking Critch.

48:44.756 --> 48:47.550
- He isn't one of us.
- He never fucking was.

48:47.550 --> 48:50.094
Letting him
out of his pen?

48:50.094 --> 48:52.055
You've lost it.

48:52.055 --> 48:54.057
You want to watch yourself.

48:54.057 --> 48:56.434
Now, Dombey...

48:58.436 --> 49:00.813
Still a credit
to the uniform, I see.

49:05.735 --> 49:07.862
- Oi! Oi!
- Easy.

49:07.862 --> 49:11.115
He can help us catch
whoever did this.

49:13.993 --> 49:15.745
Oi! Get over here.

49:15.745 --> 49:17.830
Get over here!

49:19.707 --> 49:22.085
Take this Critch back
where he belongs.

49:22.085 --> 49:24.629
Come on, let's go.

49:36.599 --> 49:39.727
<i>All is quiet ♪</i>

50:48.546 --> 50:51.466
Is everything all right,
dear sister?

50:53.092 --> 50:56.471
Sorry, did I... I kick you?

50:56.471 --> 50:58.556
No.

50:58.556 --> 51:01.726
- Are you well?
- Yes. I'm fine.

51:39.388 --> 51:42.475
Should I wear the pink or
the green dress today, my love?

51:42.475 --> 51:44.477
Miss Imogen, please.

51:44.477 --> 51:46.521
Agreus,
don't be such a fusspot.

51:46.521 --> 51:48.397
You've seen
my underthings before.

51:48.397 --> 51:51.400
Well, I know I have,
but the crew hasn't.

51:51.400 --> 51:54.487
What happens
if our steward walks in?

51:55.905 --> 51:59.408
Do you prefer me
in pink or green?

51:59.408 --> 52:00.993
I prefer you...

52:00.993 --> 52:02.578
Hmm.

52:02.578 --> 52:04.664
...in something new.

52:06.040 --> 52:08.584
Your wardrobe is getting
a little threadbare, my dear.

52:08.584 --> 52:11.504
- I don't mind.
- When we get to shore,

52:11.504 --> 52:13.881
I'll have them make you
a whole new wardrobe.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.925
We'll engage
the finest seamstress.

52:15.925 --> 52:18.970
- Whatever you desire.
- I don't want to be spoiled.

52:18.970 --> 52:21.681
Well, I want to spoil you.

52:22.723 --> 52:25.184
It isn't the dress that matters.

52:25.184 --> 52:27.353
It's who takes it off me.

52:28.813 --> 52:30.606
One of these days,
Miss Imogen...

52:30.606 --> 52:33.693
...we must make port.

52:33.693 --> 52:35.528
We've stopped
in four ports so far.

52:35.528 --> 52:38.114
- And never set foot on land.
- Well, we don't need to.

52:38.114 --> 52:41.325
They bring us everything we need
out to us in boats.

52:43.703 --> 52:45.997
Except our dignity.

52:50.459 --> 52:52.461
Imogen.

52:54.213 --> 52:56.382
I grow tired of running.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.721
I see.

53:02.930 --> 53:05.057
- Do you?
- Yes.

53:05.057 --> 53:07.393
Because here's what I see:
you are a fine lady,

53:07.393 --> 53:09.228
and I am a rich man.

53:09.228 --> 53:11.689
We have every right
to build a home together.

53:11.689 --> 53:14.734
A real home, where I
can shower you with fripperies.

53:14.734 --> 53:16.694
We could live anywhere,
anywhere you want.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.070
You name it, we'll set sail.

53:18.070 --> 53:20.239
It'll work out splendidly.

53:20.239 --> 53:22.325
Splendid when we're alone, perhaps.

53:22.325 --> 53:24.660
You care so much
about what strangers think.

53:24.660 --> 53:27.747
No. No, I don't, but I just...

53:27.747 --> 53:31.751
What we have here is simple,
and I like it.

53:31.751 --> 53:33.878
- You have no maids.
- I don't mind.

53:33.878 --> 53:36.797
- My own clothes are stained.
- I don't mind.

53:36.797 --> 53:38.883
There are weevils in the bread.

53:40.968 --> 53:43.512
But we're free here, Agreus.

53:46.223 --> 53:50.353
It's as if all my life,
I've been living in a kind of...

53:50.353 --> 53:53.981
maze...

53:53.981 --> 53:56.984
surrounded by walls
I couldn't see.

53:58.235 --> 54:00.529
Until one day, I just...

54:00.529 --> 54:03.240
stepped right through them.

54:05.368 --> 54:09.163
Can't we stay at sea
a little longer?

54:11.707 --> 54:14.418
A little longer.

54:16.003 --> 54:18.506
For as long as you like.

54:18.506 --> 54:21.217
Forever,
if that's what you want.

54:33.479 --> 54:36.148
Now...

54:36.148 --> 54:38.651
shall we have breakfast?

54:38.651 --> 54:40.611
Yes.

54:43.155 --> 54:45.366
Weevils be damned.

55:01.382 --> 55:03.718
Raise the mast!

55:03.718 --> 55:05.886
- What's happening?
- Airship! Incoming!

55:05.886 --> 55:07.388
Captain!

55:12.935 --> 55:15.062
By the Martyr...

55:15.062 --> 55:17.064
The markings are queer,

55:17.064 --> 55:20.401
but she's a Pactish dreadnaught,
or I'm a Trow.

55:20.401 --> 55:22.862
Pactish airship out this far?

55:24.155 --> 55:27.324
Aye, Mr. Astrayon,
they're signaling us to follow.

55:27.324 --> 55:28.743
Can we outrun them?

55:28.743 --> 55:31.162
She can make
double our speed!

55:32.705 --> 55:34.999
Incoming!

55:34.999 --> 55:37.460
- Starboard side!
- Take cover!

55:37.460 --> 55:39.879
Shall I change course
and follow her, sir?
