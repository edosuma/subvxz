02:22.851 --> 02:26.521
You have some valid reasons
for wanting a divorce.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.192
Excuse me.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.239
My sinuses are very
sensitive to irritants.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.199
Mmm.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.620
In the past five months,

02:42.704 --> 02:46.082
I think I've breathed freely
with both sides working

02:46.166 --> 02:48.084
maybe a week, total.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.586
I got to cut this out.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.547
It's going to kill me.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.138
I hadn't smoked for 13 years.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.144
I kept the last cigarette
from my last pack.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.815
I said, "If I never smoke
this one cigarette,

03:10.899 --> 03:13.401
"I'll never smoke again.
Period."

03:15.028 --> 03:17.738
13 years I kept that cigarette.

03:19.408 --> 03:20.533
Here.

03:23.704 --> 03:26.622
I had this little case made for it.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.915
See?

03:32.421 --> 03:34.088
13 years,

03:36.925 --> 03:40.678
and then, one Thursday afternoon,

03:40.762 --> 03:43.097
Barbara came to see me.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.934
And when she left...

03:51.607 --> 03:55.151
You know where I am
if you change your mind.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.625
Barbara and Oliver Rose.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.211
You'd have heard of them,

04:14.296 --> 04:17.214
except I kept what happened
out of the papers.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.716
I think you should
hear the story, though.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.636
It might matter to you.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.513
I won't start the clock yet.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.766
My fee is $450 an hour.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.769
When a man who makes $450 an hour

04:29.853 --> 04:32.605
wants to tell you something for free,

04:32.689 --> 04:34.357
you should listen.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.279
They met great.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.281
They agreed on that.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.450
But the way I saw it,

04:44.534 --> 04:47.703
the poor bastards never had a chance.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.456
[Thunder]

04:50.540 --> 04:54.627
It was the final day
of the season in Nantucket.

04:54.711 --> 04:58.130
A nor'easter was blowing
the last of the tourists

04:58.215 --> 04:59.590
off the island.

05:03.553 --> 05:48.180
[Thunder]

06:00.444 --> 06:02.194
The next item up for bid

06:02.279 --> 06:05.698
is an exquisite Japanese
carving, circa 1700,

06:05.782 --> 06:08.492
a rare relief of a Shinto goddess

06:08.577 --> 06:10.369
very richly detailed.

06:10.454 --> 06:11.412
The intricacy of...

06:11.496 --> 06:12.496
$10.

06:12.956 --> 06:17.043
I have $10 from the premature
young man in the gray raincoat.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.461
Do I hear 15?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.712
11.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.131
$11. Ladies and gentlemen,
please, do I hear 15?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.591
20.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.509
$20!

06:25.635 --> 06:27.553
$20. I have $20,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.806
Do I hear 25 for this
exceptionally exotic item?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.058
$30.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.601
31.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.021
$31. All right, I have $31,
ladies and gentlemen.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.065
Is this my final offer?

06:39.149 --> 06:41.275
Ladies and gentlemen, 31 going once...

06:41.359 --> 06:42.568
$40.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.696
$40! 40.
Do I hear 45?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.448
50. 5-0.

06:47.532 --> 06:51.285
$50! I have $50.
Do I hear 60?

06:51.369 --> 06:53.204
$50 going once,

06:53.330 --> 06:55.247
going twice...

06:55.332 --> 06:56.499
Sold,

06:56.583 --> 06:59.710
to the pretty lady
in the white sweater.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.546
You know how much it's worth?

07:02.631 --> 07:05.091
It doesn't matter because
I'm not going to sell it.

07:05.175 --> 07:06.675
$250.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.513
Well, I guess I have a good eye.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.515
I got to catch the last ferry.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.017
Wait a minute.
Let me carry that for you.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.519
Here. Put this on.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.978
Oh! Thanks.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.022
I love the rain.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.941
I love it, too.

07:24.027 --> 07:27.029
I know what you're thinking,
"Harvard Law. Woo, woo, woo."

07:27.114 --> 07:28.823
But I got a scholarship.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.866
I'm not rich or anything.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.327
Brilliant.
What about you?

07:33.411 --> 07:34.703
I'm not rich or brilliant.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.539
Where are you going to school?

07:36.623 --> 07:39.041
Madison. I got a scholarship,
too, gymnastics.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.044
I don't know, though.
My body's getting kind of big.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.504
It looks, um...

07:43.588 --> 07:45.548
Well, you see, it's like a pendulum.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.591
The longer it is, the slower you move.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.052
Now my vaults and my tumbling
just aren't what they used to be.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.054
My strength moves are still good.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.472
Your strength moves?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.942
I love Nantucket.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.402
[Foghorn]

08:07.821 --> 08:10.656
Oh, I'm going to miss the ferry.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.076
Thanks for
walking me. Bye.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.369
Wait a minute.
What's your name?

08:15.453 --> 08:16.662

08:19.124 --> 08:20.332
Barbara!

08:21.960 --> 08:24.837
Wait a second.
I've got a great idea.

08:27.132 --> 08:30.509
[Barbara]
Uh! Oh! Uh!

08:30.594 --> 08:33.011
Oh! Uh! Whoa!

08:33.096 --> 08:34.513
Oh! Oh!

08:34.597 --> 08:35.931
Uh, uh, uh.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.936
Uh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.188
Oh. Oh.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.106
Never, never, never apologize

08:44.191 --> 08:46.567
for being multiorgasmic.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.695
I honestly didn't know I was.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.573
Oh, bless you.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.033
Bless you.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.537
Oh, bless you.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.250
Uh.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.133
If we end up together,

09:11.218 --> 09:16.096
then this is the most romantic
day of my whole life,

09:16.181 --> 09:18.098
and if we don't,

09:18.183 --> 09:21.060
then I'm a complete slut.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.151
This is a story

09:29.236 --> 09:31.570
we're going to tell our grandchildren.

09:35.659 --> 09:36.700
Oh.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.085
Uh-oh.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.045
Ha ha ha!

09:48.129 --> 09:49.505
Uh-oh.

It's the return of the Bald Avenger.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.624
OK. That's the sixth time.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.126
Merry Christmas, Bert.

Please.

Up in there behind the party.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.820
Where are they?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.697
I don't got.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.626
Nice try.

I owe you a squeezie.

Ooh! Up we go.

11:26.478 --> 11:27.895
Come on, you.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.438
Grr.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.606
All right.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.149
Hi, honey.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.026
Yeah. Now,
you go in that chair.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.319
Got it?

11:35.403 --> 11:37.946
Well, you're going to
go in this one right here.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.907
Uh! Hey. Ohh!

11:39.991 --> 11:41.116
I got you...

11:41.201 --> 11:42.576
That's for me?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.161
It's green for you.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.287
Oh, thanks.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.830
And it's red for you.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.458
I really don't think it's such a good
idea to give them sweets like that.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.793
No. It is.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.879
Actually, I read that
kids who are deprived

11:53.963 --> 11:55.589
of sweets and candies all the time,

11:55.673 --> 11:58.133
they get obsessed by it, and
they turn out to be obese.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.135
But the little kids
who get it all the time,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.054
it's no big deal,
and they turn out normal.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.472
And here.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.641
Being a waitress on Christmas Eve

12:05.725 --> 12:07.434
is very profitable.

What do you think, guys?

12:10.105 --> 12:12.022
Nice.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.482
OK.

What do you think?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.120
Mmm...

12:27.580 --> 12:29.039
Looks like tinfoil.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.042

It doesn't make it.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.544

to take a walk. Why? Huh?

around here in the snow.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.067
OK, we're at the corner.

12:57.152 --> 13:00.070
So what do you want
to do now, walk back?

13:00.155 --> 13:02.531
No. I want to go
for a ride in your car.

I don't believe it!

13:14.669 --> 13:15.961

13:16.045 --> 13:17.588
The cook's brother
brought it over from England.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.047

13:19.132 --> 13:20.591

I used my money.

Your money's our money.
Can we afford this?

13:26.681 --> 13:28.599
You are going to be
such a huge success.

13:28.683 --> 13:31.435
This may be our last opportunity
to worry about spending money.

13:37.192 --> 13:40.068
I'm more than happy.
I'm way past happy.

I'm married.

13:41.696 --> 13:42.988
Ha ha ha!

14:00.215 --> 14:03.133

14:03.218 --> 14:05.052
And it was.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.139

tell the world who a man is,

14:19.734 --> 14:22.611
but he was definitely
moving up in the world.

He'd only been
with the firm six months

14:25.240 --> 14:27.950
when he decided to have
the senior partners over

14:28.034 --> 14:29.451
to his new apartment for dinner.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.037

This man has a face juries
can't help but believe.

the next election he'd
be running as a gelding.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.053
Well, let's drink up.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.555
Ah, yes.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.348
Good night, Mom.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.226
Oh, good night, sweethearts.

15:36.311 --> 15:37.436
Um, Mom...

15:37.520 --> 15:38.770
Yeah?

15:38.855 --> 15:40.606
Can I take some more
dessert to our room?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.941
OK, time for bed.
Let's go.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.109
Guess not.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.612
Kiss.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.113
Kiss Daddy.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.282
Good night, sweetheart.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.742
Good night.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.076
Good night, buddy.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.453
Good night, Dad.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.787
Sleep well.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.418
I used to be chubby
as a kid. Yeah.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.711
Let's eat.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.004
Yeah.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.844
Ooh.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.471
Mmmm.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.056
Oh, my!

16:15.224 --> 16:17.643
Whatever flavor is this?

16:17.727 --> 16:19.936
No, don't tell me. Uh...

16:21.230 --> 16:23.148
Let me think, now.
Ummm...

16:23.232 --> 16:25.525
It isn't apples.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.819
You make something with
apples, don't you, dear?

16:27.904 --> 16:29.488
No, unless you mean baked apples.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.323
Prunes?

16:31.407 --> 16:32.366
No. Wait a minute.
Um...

16:32.450 --> 16:34.993
This is a very special taste.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.244
Raisins!

16:36.329 --> 16:38.038
It isn't pears.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.331
Um...

16:41.501 --> 16:45.087
Um, fresh fig with, uh,
a little cognac.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.381
Figs?

16:47.465 --> 16:50.550
I never would have thought of figs.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.177
I never would have guessed.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.637
Mmmm.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.889
It's fantastic, isn't it, Elke?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.265
Mm-hmm.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.017
It's absolutely spectacular.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.894
Mrs. Marshall,
more wine?

17:00.978 --> 17:02.354
Please.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.021
Your crystal is lovely.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.107
Thank you.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.566
It's not Waterford.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.902
Baccarat.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.028
[Thump]

17:10.113 --> 17:12.489
Then we are paying
our associates too much.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.078
Actually, we got it quite reasonably.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.080
It's, uh, it's kind of
an interesting story.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.416
Why don't you tell it, Barb?

17:34.637 --> 17:37.723
Well, we were in Paris...

17:37.807 --> 17:40.058
It was our fifth anniversary.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.562
We'd just had lunch in this
wonderful little place

17:43.646 --> 17:46.690
in the market district
called the Pas de Cochon.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.024
Pied de Cochon.

17:48.109 --> 17:51.069
Thanks. We were
wandering around,

17:51.154 --> 17:53.155
and we came upon

17:53.239 --> 17:55.490
the Rue de Paradis

17:55.575 --> 17:59.077
where the Baccarat
has its factory and museum.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.413
Of course I didn't know
anything about this

18:01.497 --> 18:02.789
before I met Oliver.

18:02.874 --> 18:05.792
I mean, my mother bought
her glasses at the A&P.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.044
You know, the kind
with the raised flowers

18:08.129 --> 18:10.505
that always chipped off
after a couple weeks,

18:10.590 --> 18:12.340
and they were always
yellow, too, remember?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.842
Heh heh heh.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.011
Anyway, here we were
in this immense room

18:16.095 --> 18:18.138
filled with everything
Baccarat had ever made.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.015
A field of crystal.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.310
It was so, so pretty.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.312
I mean, I felt...

18:27.273 --> 18:29.816
Whatever the word.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.818
And suddenly, from the next room,

18:31.903 --> 18:34.029
we heard the sound of glass breaking.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.572
Well, I looked at Oliver,

18:35.656 --> 18:39.034
and Oliver looked at me,
and then... Oh. Ye... No.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.911
Well, before that, there was
this big black limousine

18:40.995 --> 18:43.079
out on the street...
Now, this is important.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.831
Well, actually,
before the limousine...

18:44.916 --> 18:46.708
To make a long story short,

18:46.793 --> 18:49.085
a wealthy French couple
had ordered a special design

18:49.170 --> 18:50.545
for their anniversary.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.631
By the time it was ready,
they were getting a divorce.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.591
The woman had smashed her half,

18:54.675 --> 18:57.052
and I convinced the man
to sell us his half cheap

18:57.136 --> 18:59.054
just to spite her.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.514
Heh heh heh heh!

19:02.350 --> 19:06.770
And, uh, that's our Baccarat story.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.190
[Clink]

19:16.739 --> 19:20.575
I think everybody had a
great time, don't you?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.620
To make a long story short, no.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.122
I'm sorry. You were
just rambling on.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.124
Well, then, tell
your own story next time.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.585
You care so desperately
what everybody thinks,

19:30.670 --> 19:32.045
fuck face.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.631
They're my bosses.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.341
They're Gavin's bosses, too.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.135
It didn't stop him from getting
a foot job all through dinner.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.304
Gavin doesn't care about
making partner.

19:41.389 --> 19:43.348
He doesn't have a wife and kids.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.766
I do.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.145
You want to keep living
in this apartment?

19:49.230 --> 19:51.147
Because you do not buy a house

19:51.232 --> 19:53.149
on an associate's salary.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.111
At least not the kind
of house that we want.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.655
OK, I care what they think.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.157
I care, all right?
I care.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.826
Shoot me.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.120
And that phony laugh.

20:05.746 --> 20:07.122
"Heh heh heh heh."

20:07.206 --> 20:09.124
That was a genuine laugh.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.959
Heh heh heh heh.

20:11.252 --> 20:14.170
OK, all right, all right.
Maybe I overdid it.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.299
I was just trying to
keep things going.

20:18.259 --> 20:23.138
[Sigh]

20:24.473 --> 20:28.101
God. I hope they didn't
notice what a jerk I am.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.605
They never seem to.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.782
"Dear homeowner,

20:42.867 --> 20:45.577
"I love your house!

20:45.661 --> 20:48.079
"If you ever consider selling,

20:48.164 --> 20:51.541
"please contact me.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.251
"Barbara Rose."

20:53.336 --> 20:56.588
Mom! I'm going to
be late for practice!

20:56.672 --> 20:59.049
You've been doing this for a year,

20:59.133 --> 21:00.550
and nobody's called.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.552
This is a great house.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.554
I love this house.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.598
It's a waste of time!

21:06.682 --> 21:09.225
I'll bet I get this house. Five bucks.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.186
Five bucks.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.605
[Dog Barking]

21:17.652 --> 21:19.319
Man...

21:22.323 --> 21:23.365
Hello.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.617
Oh, I was just leaving a note.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.118
How kind.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.620
Please, won't you come in?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.038
All right.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.209
Oh...

21:36.462 --> 21:37.754
[Door Closes]

21:39.548 --> 21:41.132
I don't believe we've met.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.592
Barbara Rose.

21:42.677 --> 21:43.843
I'm Maureen.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.304
I don't remember
Mother mentioning you,

21:46.389 --> 21:48.556
but she had so many friends.

21:50.559 --> 21:51.601
Oh...

21:51.686 --> 21:53.478
Oh, I'm very sorry.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.647
Thank you.
She went peacefully.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.733
What am I going to do
with this old place?

21:58.818 --> 22:01.027
I just can't bear
to put it up for sale

22:01.153 --> 22:04.572
and have a bunch of strangers
tromping through it.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.574
If I could just find someone

22:06.659 --> 22:09.077
who would love it as much as Mom did.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.079
It's more important to me

22:11.163 --> 22:13.540
than whatever money we get for it.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.001
If you hear of anybody who might...

22:16.085 --> 22:18.586
Can we go up and pick our rooms?

22:18.671 --> 22:22.090
We can do whatever we want.
This is our house.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.175
Who gets the first pick?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.096
Oh, don't get scared.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.098
We'll do it together.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.058
I just feel kind of strange.

22:32.143 --> 22:35.103
I mean, this house is so beautiful,

22:35.187 --> 22:37.105
and we live here.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.107
Is this who we are?

22:39.191 --> 22:41.026
This is me?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.072
I'll be home early.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.116
Where are you going?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.118
To work.
I wish I didn't have to,

22:50.202 --> 22:52.579
but somebody's
got to pay for all this.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.080
It's Saturday.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.458
Come on.
This is a great day.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.876
You've got the fun part.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.002
[Door Closes]

23:06.677 --> 23:08.553
Kitchen first.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.101
Everything was working for the Roses.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.395
Let me restate that.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.107
The Roses were working for everything.

23:21.192 --> 23:23.109
Over the next six years,

23:23.194 --> 23:25.653
Oliver dug in, made senior partner.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.656
The kids lopped off 70, 80 pounds,

23:28.741 --> 23:31.618
and Barbara labored seven days a week

23:31.702 --> 23:33.661
to create the perfect home

23:33.746 --> 23:36.039
that Oliver always dreamed of...

23:36.123 --> 23:40.126
Not easy for a girl
who grew up drinking her milk

23:40.211 --> 23:42.629
from glasses
with chipped yellow flowers.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.672
There were a million choices,

23:44.757 --> 23:47.675
and she sweated every one of them.

23:47.802 --> 23:51.096
She refinished all the tables herself.

23:51.180 --> 23:54.933
It took six months to get
the floors exactly right,

23:55.017 --> 23:56.893
100 Sundays to find

23:56.977 --> 23:59.395
the perfect Staffordshire
figures and plates

23:59.480 --> 24:01.898
that she put over the fireplace.

24:01.982 --> 24:05.068
When you work that hard on something,

24:05.152 --> 24:07.028
eventually, you have to finish

24:07.113 --> 24:09.531
and face the awful question...

24:09.615 --> 24:11.491
What's left to do?

24:16.247 --> 24:18.039
Continuous...

24:18.124 --> 24:19.582
Excuse me.
You working?

24:19.667 --> 24:20.834
Yes. Is it important?

24:20.918 --> 24:23.044
Yes, kind of.
I hope so.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.546
Stephanie Maze called

24:24.630 --> 24:26.965
to say thank you for
dinner the other night.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.091
Yeah?

24:28.175 --> 24:29.425
She said the pate I made was so good,

24:29.510 --> 24:30.844
I should think about
going into business.

24:30.928 --> 24:31.970
Uh-huh.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.555
So I asked her if she really meant it,

24:33.639 --> 24:35.098
and she said she did,

24:35.182 --> 24:37.851
so I took a pound over to
her and collected $35.

24:37.935 --> 24:42.105
I'd almost forgotten what
it felt like to make money.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.983
You sold liver to our friends?

24:45.067 --> 24:47.443
She paid me in cash, Oliver.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.404
Somehow that felt different

24:49.488 --> 24:52.448
from the money I get cashing a check.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.618
It made me feel like
trading in the Volvo

24:55.703 --> 24:58.121
on one of those
four-wheel drive things

24:58.205 --> 25:01.082
with big knobby tires
and the 200-horsepower engine.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.751
So I did. I'm going to
pick it up tomorrow.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.132
Thank you so much for telling me.

25:09.216 --> 25:12.302
Uh, and you think that you need this?

25:12.386 --> 25:15.263
I mean, the Volvo is a fine car.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.931
I'll pay for it with my own money.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.725
How much does it cost?

25:18.809 --> 25:21.811
I know it was kind of crazy,

25:21.896 --> 25:24.355
but I just wanted it, OK?

25:24.440 --> 25:25.899
25,000.

25:28.068 --> 25:32.530
So you only have to sell
700 more pounds of pate.

25:32.615 --> 25:34.532
Maybe I will.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.826
Maybe I'm starting a business.

25:36.911 --> 25:39.829
But if you don't want me to, I...

25:39.914 --> 25:42.874
No, no, no, no, no.
You do it.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.292
Do it. Do it.

25:50.424 --> 25:51.549
[Sigh]

25:51.634 --> 25:53.134
I'm doing it.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.060
Wait a minute.
Wait one minute, here.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.520
I do not understand
what's the attitude.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.566
I told you I would handle it.

26:08.651 --> 26:11.069
That's right, and when I
didn't see anything happening,

26:11.153 --> 26:13.071
I went ahead,
and I set up the interview.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.572
I would have done it.

26:14.657 --> 26:18.034
I know, but sometimes
you need a little push.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.579
We all need a little push.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.830
[Meow!]

26:22.915 --> 26:25.083
We agreed that if you were
going to do this liver bit,

26:25.167 --> 26:27.377
we would need someone to take
care of the house full-time,

26:27.461 --> 26:28.544
right?

26:28.629 --> 26:30.630
Right, Oliver.
Right again.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.590
Oh, come on.
Let's not argue, OK?

26:32.675 --> 26:34.342
Just think about it for a minute!

26:38.681 --> 26:41.599
If you don't want
to interview the lady,

26:41.684 --> 26:43.601
I will send her home.

26:43.686 --> 26:46.396
I'm only trying
to make your life easier.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.114
Somehow the thought of a
stranger living in my house

26:56.198 --> 26:58.116
just seems weird, you know?

26:58.200 --> 26:59.200
Doesn't it?

26:59.285 --> 27:02.120
I don't mean just for us,
but for you, too.

27:02.204 --> 27:05.164
Oh, but, then, I guess
you do this all the time.

27:05.249 --> 27:09.127
Oh, no. I try this as a means
of finding room and board

27:09.211 --> 27:10.795
and a little money.

27:10.879 --> 27:14.590
I'm also attending a few classes
at William and Mary College,

27:14.717 --> 27:17.635
but that won't interfere
with my duties.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.139
Oh, that's great.
I'm happy for you, really.

27:21.223 --> 27:23.057
So do I get the job?

27:23.142 --> 27:26.019
The fact is, Susan,
I don't need a live-in.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.021
This was my husband's suggestion.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.898
I mean, I have raised
two kids on my own,

27:30.983 --> 27:32.483
and now they're about
to go off to college.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.819
They were both accepted at Harvard.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.821
Mmm. That's
a nice school, too.

27:36.905 --> 27:41.034
Thanks. So anyway, it will just
be Oliver and me here at home

27:41.118 --> 27:44.037
although I am getting going
my own catering business.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.664
But let's face it.
I don't need to work, not for the money,

27:46.749 --> 27:49.500
and that does not necessarily make me

27:49.585 --> 27:52.503
one of these women who's
married to a successful man

27:52.588 --> 27:55.506
and has dedicated her life
to him and her children,

27:55.591 --> 27:57.300
and then finds
herself desperately trying

27:57.384 --> 27:59.010
to validate herself as a human being

27:59.094 --> 28:01.054
because her children
are about to leave her

28:01.138 --> 28:03.056
by studying photography
or opening an art gallery

28:03.140 --> 28:06.559
or going into interior design
with her husband's office, no.

28:06.643 --> 28:09.312
I mean, I have a wonderful house

28:09.396 --> 28:11.564
crammed with beautiful things.

28:11.648 --> 28:15.068
I did this house myself.
I did a great job...

28:15.152 --> 28:18.488
Not that I'm necessarily
a slave to materialism, no,

28:18.614 --> 28:22.158
but I am proud of what
I have accomplished,

28:22.242 --> 28:24.243
although, I suppose,

28:24.328 --> 28:27.038
some people would find
my life disgusting.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.832
No. Disgusting
is too strong a word.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.501
No. I would not say

28:31.585 --> 28:34.545
that many people would respect
the choices that I have made

28:34.630 --> 28:37.048
although women would, women like me.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.051
But, then, I don't care
what they think

28:40.135 --> 28:42.387
because I can't stand who they are.

28:42.471 --> 28:46.808
What I'm trying to say, Susan,
is that I don't need a live-in.

28:49.228 --> 28:53.022
Well, thanks for the
interview and good luck

28:53.107 --> 28:55.274
and God bless you.

28:55.359 --> 29:00.238
I would like you to understand
that if I were to hire you,

29:00.322 --> 29:02.198
my life would probably change.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.575
You would be this new element
in the house, you see?

29:04.660 --> 29:05.701
[Sniffle]

29:06.161 --> 29:07.495
Well...

29:08.831 --> 29:11.499
Let me show you where your room is.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.842
Hey.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.802
Hey, Bennie.
Dumb dog.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.595
Here, boy.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.805
[Arf!]

29:30.727 --> 29:35.606
Bennie. Come on. Let's see
if he'll go for it again.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.066
Bennie.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.526
Hiya!

29:39.778 --> 29:41.112
[Sniffing]

29:41.196 --> 29:42.864
Yeah. Dumb.

29:46.535 --> 29:47.869
[Dog Whining]

29:55.210 --> 29:56.627
Oh, the Bennie boy.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.130
The Bennie, Bennie, Bennie boy.

29:59.214 --> 30:02.258
Yes, he's the best boy.
He's the best boy.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.135
We love our little boy.
Oh, he's a good boy.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.137
He's a Bennie boy.
We love our Bennie boy.

30:06.221 --> 30:07.555
Yes, he's a pretty dog.

[Telephone Rings]

30:35.125 --> 30:36.667
Rose residence.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.128
Susan, is that for me?

30:39.213 --> 30:40.671
It's for Josh.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.673
Are you expecting a call?

30:42.758 --> 30:45.134
Jason Larrabee said he'd call
to confirm lunch tomorrow.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.678
I'm trying to land him as a client.

30:47.763 --> 30:50.181
The word around town is
he's up for a cabinet post.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.724
I wish he'd call.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.100
He will.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.940
Listen, did you get a chance to
look over that contract for me?

30:59.024 --> 31:00.900
What contract?

31:00.984 --> 31:03.528
On the concert luncheon I'm doing.

31:03.612 --> 31:06.113
Oh, yeah.
No, but I'll read it this weekend.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.698
OK.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.242
No. No, not OK.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.119
I have to sign it tomorrow, which
is why I gave it to you last week,

31:12.204 --> 31:14.330
but it's probably fine.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.541
Well, I'll read it now.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.875
Oh, no, don't bother.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.377
No. Get it.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.549
Sure.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.480
What? What is it?

31:39.565 --> 31:41.649
It's a fly.
Where'd it go?

31:41.733 --> 31:44.068
On the fridge.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.239
Stay upwind of him.

31:51.702 --> 31:55.663
Aha! How about that?

31:55.747 --> 31:57.623
Not bad, huh?

31:57.708 --> 31:59.667
I admire your technique.

[Telephone Rings]

32:04.756 --> 32:06.632
Hello?
Oh, Mr. Larrabee.

32:06.717 --> 32:09.594
Hi. How are you?
No, no, it's not too late.

32:09.678 --> 32:11.053
[Splashing]

32:11.138 --> 32:13.180
Can you hang on just one second

32:13.265 --> 32:15.600
while I use the other phone?
Thank you.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.565
Yes, sir. I'm looking forward
to that, too, myself.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.568
No, no. Of course
you're not bothering me.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.404
Lawyers, we never sleep.

32:28.488 --> 32:32.241

to you, sir, 24 hours a...

32:52.220 --> 32:55.097
Who left all the appliances
on in the kitchen?

32:55.182 --> 32:57.642
It sounds like who-knows-what
going on down there.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.602
I must have hit a couple of
switches when I was cleaning up.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.646
You know how that can happen.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.606
I got great news.

33:03.690 --> 33:06.651
Lunch is on tomorrow with Larrabee.

33:06.735 --> 33:11.113
I'm going to meet him
at his club in Philadelphia.

33:11.198 --> 33:12.615
He's mine.

33:12.699 --> 33:16.118
Look how crazy you are
about yourself right now.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.620
I'm sorry.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.163
Don't apologize.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.165
I kind of live with the assumption

33:21.249 --> 33:23.125
that all guys owe an apology

33:23.210 --> 33:25.670
to the women that they live with.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.005
Oh, you're so full of shit.

33:28.090 --> 33:31.676
So where's that
little contract of yours?

Maybe I can up your price, huh?

Where is it?

I'm sure it's all right.

Better get me while you can afford me.

Let me have it.

Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.522
Mmm.

34:30.110 --> 34:33.987
You think you're
pretty strong, don't you?

34:41.121 --> 34:43.956
What the hell is wrong with you?

34:48.128 --> 34:51.338
If you're with a woman
for any length of time,

34:51.422 --> 34:53.549
eventually you'll
ask her that question.

34:53.632 --> 34:56.010
If she doesn't answer, that's trouble,

34:56.094 --> 34:58.053
and when trouble begins,

34:58.138 --> 35:00.514
it comes at you from
directions you'd never expect.

very well served by our firm,

around town are true.

a Senate confirmation hearing

be of help with that.

You're going to have to
swallow some barium,

but you'll like it.
It's peppermint flavored.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.563
I don't think that there's anything

37:12.647 --> 37:14.648
more important
than the hors d'oeuvres.

37:14.733 --> 37:17.568
That's where people will make
their first judgment of the food.

All right. All right.
I'm leaving right now.

to my mother like this.

just going to be great.

an esophageal tear,

commonly known as a hiatal hernia,

37:45.513 --> 37:46.972
right there.

37:47.057 --> 37:49.475
The pain symptoms are
almost identical to angina.

37:49.559 --> 37:52.937
Stress, coffee, spicy foods, gas.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.980
Your nerve endings get irritated,

37:55.065 --> 37:56.941
and, well, you know
what that feels like...

37:57.025 --> 37:58.984
Not pleasant, but not fatal.

Could you get this hiatal hernia,

between someone's legs?

54:24.720 --> 54:27.138

When it comes to women,

54:30.225 --> 54:34.145
I hope I'm a better man
now than I was.

54:36.231 --> 54:38.066

I'll never make another mistake
like I made with Oliver.

on the job at hand.

She claims she found the house.

54:57.044 --> 54:58.628
She did find the house. Right?

54:58.712 --> 55:00.046
Yes, she did,
but that's not the point.

55:00.172 --> 55:01.464
She said she made it what it is.

55:01.548 --> 55:03.174
She didn't.

55:03.384 --> 55:06.135
Look, I'm not keeping score,
but if I were keeping score,

55:06.220 --> 55:08.638
it'd be about 83 to 6, my favor.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.139
All the really good stuff,

55:10.224 --> 55:12.100
those wonderful Staffordshire dogs...

55:12.184 --> 55:14.602
In fact, most of
the Staffordshires I found.

55:14.687 --> 55:16.646
And that Art Deco rug,

55:16.730 --> 55:19.148
and even that gray stove
in the kitchen.

55:19.233 --> 55:21.943
She never would have bought
it if I hadn't pushed her.

Uh-huh.

she's good at buying.

55:25.739 --> 55:27.657

put in the closet,

55:27.741 --> 55:29.742

Even though they reside
under the same roof?

56:05.279 --> 56:08.197
Yeah. The law was put
on the books for poor people,

56:08.282 --> 56:09.365
folks who couldn't afford separate

56:09.450 --> 56:10.533

but we can use it, too.

56:12.202 --> 56:13.661
That means I can move back in.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.955
If your divorce is settled in court,

56:16.040 --> 56:17.999
it shows that you're
committed to the property,

56:18.083 --> 56:20.376
plus you can see she doesn't
start selling off the assets.

56:20.461 --> 56:23.296
And I can work on her, get her
to fold on this house thing.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.465
No. No, Oliver,
you don't even deal with her.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.008

$163,800.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:18.049
How did you arrive at that number?

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:21.385
Fairly. You do approximately
the same things as Susan.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:24.180
No. She goes to college.
She should make more than me.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:28.059
There is no comparison whatsoever

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.560
between what she does...

01:01:29.644 --> 01:01:33.064
Her salary is a base, so I doubled it.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:35.524
And that wasn't enough,
and then I tripled it,

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:38.569
and that's how I came up
with this figure...

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:42.073
$490,633, approximately.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.075

agree to give up the house.

lot more out of knowing me

ask you what that means.

idea of time allotments.

01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:47.110
I thought you were Barbara.

01:37:47.195 --> 01:37:49.363
Mr. Rose,
what's going on here?

01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:51.532
Are you OK?

01:37:51.616 --> 01:37:53.367
I'm fine.

01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:54.826
Fine.

01:37:54.911 --> 01:37:56.870
Listen, Susan,

01:37:56.955 --> 01:37:59.831
I'm in the middle of something now.

01:37:59.916 --> 01:38:02.376
I really can't talk about it.

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:04.336
Just let me get the door for you.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.380
Is Mrs. Rose all right?

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:08.048
Yes. She's fine.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.884
Where is she?
Is she OK?

01:38:10.969 --> 01:38:12.886
You're sure she's all right?

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:15.389
Barbara, Susan's here.

01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:18.392
She wants to know if you're OK.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:19.977
Never better.

01:38:23.982 --> 01:38:26.900
Thank you for dropping by, Susan.

01:38:26.985 --> 01:38:29.236
Come outside with me,
Mr. Rose.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.154
Let's go.

01:38:35.994 --> 01:38:38.078
Wait a minute.
I forgot something.

01:38:38.162 --> 01:38:39.997
What?

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:42.583
Barbara.

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:43.709
No!

01:38:43.793 --> 01:38:45.419
Mr. Rose.

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:46.920
Mr. Rose!

01:38:47.005 --> 01:38:48.422
[Hammering]

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:49.840
Oh, no.

01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:53.552
Oh, my God.

01:38:53.636 --> 01:38:55.762
Mrs. Rose...

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:17.701
[Ringing]

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:22.456
Only

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:29.421
[Ringing] You

01:39:31.007 --> 01:39:33.383
[Ringing] Can

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:37.262
[Ringing]

01:39:45.396 --> 01:39:47.439
[Ringing] Can...

01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:49.816
Ha ha ha ha!

01:39:49.901 --> 01:39:52.486
What fresh hell is this?

01:39:53.279 --> 01:39:55.113
Uh...

01:39:58.534 --> 01:40:01.995
Only

01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:03.747
[Ringing]

01:40:03.831 --> 01:40:06.249
You

01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:12.089
Can

01:40:27.105 --> 01:40:29.439
Hi.

01:40:32.610 --> 01:40:35.070
I brought you a surprise.

01:40:58.636 --> 01:40:59.720
[Sighs]

01:41:20.074 --> 01:41:23.076
Nah nah nah nah nah nah

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.998
You are a jerk.

01:41:34.672 --> 01:41:37.549
Tell you what...

01:41:37.633 --> 01:41:40.594
You say it's mine,

01:41:40.678 --> 01:41:44.181
and you can have
everything in this house.

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:46.683
OK.

01:41:47.602 --> 01:41:49.644
It's mine.

01:42:20.802 --> 01:42:22.469
Ah! Ah! Oh!

01:42:22.553 --> 01:42:23.804
Barbara.

01:42:24.889 --> 01:42:27.015
Oh... Oh...

01:42:27.099 --> 01:42:28.809
Barbara...
Barbara, I'm sorry.

01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:30.644
Are you all right?
You OK?

01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:31.937
You OK?

01:42:32.021 --> 01:42:33.021
Ah!

01:42:37.735 --> 01:42:38.735
Ya!

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:44.741
Uh!

01:43:09.934 --> 01:43:13.603
Ugh!

01:43:16.315 --> 01:43:18.859
Well, well, well.

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:23.905
I'd be glad to help you

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:26.575
in exchange for the house.

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:28.493
No.

01:43:28.578 --> 01:43:30.370
Please don't break the terrazzo floor

01:43:30.454 --> 01:43:32.038
when you land.

01:43:40.756 --> 01:43:43.633
Oh! That's better.

01:43:49.015 --> 01:43:52.350
I'm going to save you
whether you like it or not.

01:43:52.435 --> 01:43:54.519
That won't work.

01:43:55.897 --> 01:43:58.940
It's too heavy.
It'll pull you off.

01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:00.066
It'll work.

01:44:02.278 --> 01:44:04.487
Ugh!

01:44:06.532 --> 01:44:08.116
Hmm!

01:44:16.375 --> 01:44:18.793
Uh! Uh!

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.378
Oliver.

01:44:21.672 --> 01:44:22.672
Uh!

01:44:24.508 --> 01:44:25.842
[Crash]

01:44:36.228 --> 01:44:37.479
Uh...

01:44:37.563 --> 01:44:38.897
Almost.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:43.485
All right.
All right.

01:44:43.569 --> 01:44:45.987
I think I can swing this over

01:44:46.072 --> 01:44:47.989
to the balcony.

01:44:48.074 --> 01:44:51.576
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:53.495
I loosened the bolt.

01:44:53.579 --> 01:44:55.997
I was going to drop it on you.

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:57.332
Ooh.

01:44:57.416 --> 01:44:59.209
Oh, that's a good one.

01:45:04.966 --> 01:45:06.299
[Car Approaching]

01:45:06.384 --> 01:45:07.634
Gavin!

01:45:07.718 --> 01:45:10.512
Gavin.

01:45:10.596 --> 01:45:13.014
Susan, let me stop the car first.

01:45:13.099 --> 01:45:14.516
Thank God you're here.

01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.476
I thought you'd never arrive.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.019
They're in there,

01:45:18.104 --> 01:45:19.270
and they're over the edge.

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:23.483
I guess at this point,
there's no reason

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:26.194
to be anything but absolutely honest.

01:45:26.278 --> 01:45:29.364
Through all that's happened,

01:45:29.448 --> 01:45:31.491
I always loved you.

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.620
I know.

01:45:37.957 --> 01:45:39.958
And through all this

01:45:41.794 --> 01:45:45.088
you loved me, too, didn't you?

01:45:48.217 --> 01:45:50.260
[Ring]

01:45:52.930 --> 01:45:55.223
Get that, would you, Oliver?
[Ring]

01:45:57.351 --> 01:45:58.393
No?

01:45:58.477 --> 01:45:59.728
No. No, no, no.

01:45:59.812 --> 01:46:00.979
OK. We go in.

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.107
Uh!

01:46:04.567 --> 01:46:06.401
Oh, my God.

01:46:06.485 --> 01:46:08.153
Oliver!

01:46:08.237 --> 01:46:10.363
Barbara!

01:46:10.448 --> 01:46:11.614
Gavin!
Gavin!

01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:13.700
Gavin, get a ladder!

01:46:13.784 --> 01:46:15.326
OK!

01:46:17.288 --> 01:46:18.413
Ohh...

01:46:18.497 --> 01:46:21.499
I knew everything would be all right.

01:46:21.584 --> 01:46:22.709
[Clang]

01:46:27.256 --> 01:46:28.506
No!
No!

01:46:30.051 --> 01:46:34.929
Gavin!

01:46:35.765 --> 01:46:37.265
Gavin!
Gavin!

01:46:40.102 --> 01:46:41.519
[Whimpers]

01:46:44.023 --> 01:46:45.940
We're going to be all right.

01:46:46.025 --> 01:46:47.817
You see those two wires?

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:49.569
Yeah.

01:46:49.653 --> 01:46:53.990
Each of them can hold
at least 200 pounds.

01:47:04.168 --> 01:47:07.545
[Creaking]

01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:39.744
Aah!

01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:08.940
We're coming!

01:49:12.171 --> 01:49:14.088
Oh, my God.

01:49:14.173 --> 01:49:15.965
They're dead.

01:49:16.842 --> 01:49:18.218
[Crying]

01:49:36.654 --> 01:49:38.738
Some story, huh?

01:49:43.702 --> 01:49:45.620
What's the moral,

01:49:45.704 --> 01:49:48.456
other than dog people
should marry dog people

01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:51.042
and cat people should
marry cat people?

01:49:52.878 --> 01:49:54.212
I don't know.

01:49:56.173 --> 01:49:58.132
Could be just this.

01:49:58.217 --> 01:50:02.553
A civilized divorce
is a contradiction in terms.

01:50:04.723 --> 01:50:08.142
Maybe because of what happened,
I've become too traditional.

01:50:08.227 --> 01:50:10.144
Maybe it's not natural

01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:12.814
to stay married
to one person for life.

01:50:12.898 --> 01:50:14.816
My parents did it.

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.859
63 years,

01:50:16.944 --> 01:50:19.612
a few of them good.

01:50:23.701 --> 01:50:26.160
So, look. Here it is.

01:50:26.287 --> 01:50:28.955
We can begin.

01:50:29.039 --> 01:50:31.457
When it comes to your wife,

01:50:31.542 --> 01:50:33.459
I'm going to urge you

01:50:33.544 --> 01:50:37.463
to be generous
to the point of night sweats

01:50:37.548 --> 01:50:39.966
because
the all-important thing here

01:50:40.050 --> 01:50:42.468
is to get you through this

01:50:42.553 --> 01:50:44.470
as quickly and cleanly as possible

01:50:44.555 --> 01:50:47.473
so that you can begin
rebuilding your life.

01:50:47.558 --> 01:50:48.891
OK?

01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:52.520
Or,

01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:00.486
you can get up and go home

01:51:00.571 --> 01:51:05.992
and try to find some shred
of what you once loved

01:51:06.076 --> 01:51:10.246
about the sweetheart of your youth.

01:51:14.585 --> 01:51:16.919
It's your life.

01:51:19.923 --> 01:51:21.591
Take a minute.

01:51:57.628 --> 01:51:59.545
Hi. What are you doing?

01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:01.339
I'm coming home. Love you.

01:52:01.423 --> 01:52:02.632
[Kiss]
