20:12.440 --> 20:14.940
Wouldn't you know it, the
one day I forget my EpiPen

20:15.130 --> 20:18.980
is the one day they cook the
French fries in peanut oil.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.510
- God.
- No, don't sweat it.

20:21.710 --> 20:23.510
The bigger disappointment
was me thinking

20:23.710 --> 20:25.640
I would get to haunt
all the assholes who

20:25.840 --> 20:27.300
tortured me while I was here.

20:27.490 --> 20:30.080
But uh, instead I was
haunted by all the jokes

20:30.280 --> 20:32.870
they made once I was gone.

20:33.070 --> 20:34.520
What do you mean?

20:34.720 --> 20:37.780
- I was a gay kid in the
'90s who died because he

20:37.980 --> 20:40.500
was allergic to nuts.

20:41.580 --> 20:45.230
OK, that's where you're
supposed to laugh.

20:45.430 --> 20:48.620
Still fixating, aren't you?

20:48.820 --> 20:50.450
- Xavier's got to have
that phone for a reason.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.020
Maybe.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.930
But maybe it doesn't
matter in the end.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.540
Why wouldn't it matter?

20:56.740 --> 20:58.200
- I'm just trying to
prepare you for the fact

20:58.400 --> 20:59.410
that you might not
like the answers

20:59.610 --> 21:01.070
to all of your questions.

21:01.270 --> 21:02.160
- If people thought your
boyfriend killed you,

21:02.360 --> 21:03.770
wouldn't you want to know?

21:03.970 --> 21:05.080
- No one ever called
me their boyfriend.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.920
And besides, even if they did,
we'd have to hide it.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.120
That is why I love this place.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.040
Can't hide anything in here.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.780
And don't try to tell me that
this is predatory behavior.

21:19.980 --> 21:21.440
I'm a ghost.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.920
<i>What the heck</i>
<i>am I going to do?</i>

21:24.120 --> 21:25.800
[locker clatters]

21:27.630 --> 21:28.970
- You're going to
get us in trouble.

21:29.160 --> 21:33.620
You're the one who's trouble.

21:33.820 --> 21:36.460
- I really like you,
Maddie Nears.

21:39.770 --> 21:41.110
[door opens]

21:41.310 --> 21:42.760
[whispers] Shit, shit, shit.
Come on.

21:42.960 --> 21:43.850
I got an idea.

21:44.050 --> 21:46.810
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

21:47.010 --> 21:47.810
Shit.

21:48.010 --> 21:49.510
Hide, hide!

21:49.710 --> 21:52.860
- Hello?
Anybody in here?

21:53.060 --> 21:53.820
[water rushing]

21:54.020 --> 21:56.910
Hello?

21:57.110 --> 21:57.910
Hello?

21:58.110 --> 21:59.170
Somebody in here?

21:59.370 --> 22:02.170
You can't be in here.

22:02.370 --> 22:05.310
Xavier, what-- what
the hell are you doing?

22:05.510 --> 22:05.960
Mr. G, what are you doing?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.870
I'm showering.

22:08.070 --> 22:09.880
- Xavier, the school
is closed at 6:00 p.m.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.790
- You can't be in here.
- Mr. G, I'm sorry.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.010
I just don't really feel
comfortable with you

22:13.210 --> 22:14.010
watching me like this.

22:14.210 --> 22:15.490
- I-- I wasn't.

22:15.690 --> 22:16.970
I was just closing up.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.670
Uh, just finish up
what you're doing.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.280
You've got-- you've
got to get out of here.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.930
- I just feel very
exposed to you right now.

22:22.130 --> 22:23.460
It's a very
compromising position.

22:23.650 --> 22:24.370
I feel compromised.
Wonder what--

22:24.570 --> 22:26.550
Damn it, just finish up.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.210
Have a good night.

22:34.700 --> 22:37.960
[laughs]

22:45.180 --> 22:46.700
There's no way he did it.

22:46.890 --> 22:47.740
Wait, what?

22:47.940 --> 22:49.130
Where are you going?

22:49.330 --> 22:49.920
Simon.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.400
Slow down.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.400
Simon.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.400
Hey!

22:54.600 --> 22:57.840
Sorry.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.800
Simon.

22:59.990 --> 23:00.970
I knew it.

23:01.170 --> 23:02.150
I fucking knew it.

23:02.340 --> 23:03.320
We don't know everything yet.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.800
He has her phone, Nicole.

23:05.000 --> 23:05.850
That's evidence.

23:06.040 --> 23:07.060
Evidence of what?

23:07.260 --> 23:07.800
You're acting crazy.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.720
Look.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.590
What if she just gave
him her phone for--

23:11.790 --> 23:13.770
I don't know, so she could go
out of town for a few days?

23:13.970 --> 23:15.460
- Out of town?
Where?

23:15.660 --> 23:16.550
Where would Maddie go?
And what about the blood?

23:16.750 --> 23:18.030
Why are you doing this?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.470
Going to the
worst-case scenario?

23:19.670 --> 23:21.820
How does that help anything?

23:22.020 --> 23:23.080
What?

23:23.280 --> 23:24.270
What's Claire Z doing?

23:38.850 --> 23:39.790
Oh!

23:39.990 --> 23:42.620
Hey.

23:42.820 --> 23:43.710
- Now's not really
a great time.

23:43.910 --> 23:44.750
Wally Clark.

23:44.950 --> 23:46.450
Class of '84.

23:46.650 --> 23:47.500
I was laid out by a tackle
during my senior year

23:47.690 --> 23:48.410
homecoming game.

23:48.610 --> 23:50.500
Never made it off the field.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.890
Nice to meet you.

23:53.090 --> 23:53.940
Um, Maddie.

23:54.140 --> 23:54.980
Current unsolved mystery.

23:55.180 --> 23:56.240
Pleasure.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.940
Wait, Wally Clark?

23:58.140 --> 23:59.380
Yeah.

23:59.580 --> 24:01.030
Why does that sound familiar?

24:01.230 --> 24:01.770
- Oh, well, they named
the stadium after me.

24:01.970 --> 24:04.080
Ah.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.250
That must feel nice.

24:06.450 --> 24:08.080
Look, I can't really
chat right now,

24:08.280 --> 24:08.820
because I've got some
holes in my memory to fill.

24:09.020 --> 24:09.910
Hey.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.480
Well, that's why I'm here.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.960
I can-- I can totally
help you fill your holes.

24:13.150 --> 24:13.910
- Excuse me?
- Oh.

24:14.110 --> 24:16.130
Um, OK.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.830
I obviously did not mean it
for it to come off that way.

24:18.030 --> 24:19.570
In my head, it was more
of, like, a metaphoric--

24:19.770 --> 24:20.530
I can help you figure
things out, if you need it.

24:20.730 --> 24:21.660
- OK.
I can handle myself.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.180
OK.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.580
- And I don't really think
I need to take advice

24:24.780 --> 24:26.190
from someone who
looks like they're

24:26.390 --> 24:27.750
- headed to aerobics class.
- Yeah, right?

24:27.950 --> 24:29.410
I mean, I'm glad I
had this in my locker,

24:29.610 --> 24:30.890
or else I would have been
rocking shoulder pads.

24:31.090 --> 24:31.840
Which would have
sucked, because I think

24:32.040 --> 24:33.670
those are totally out now.

24:33.870 --> 24:34.590
I do wish I brought my
Walkman to school that day.

24:34.790 --> 24:35.540
Or clean socks.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.110
Or deodorant.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.810
Wait.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.680
Were you missing anything
when you came here?

24:41.880 --> 24:43.810
- I mean, other than a
pulse and a heartbeat?

24:44.010 --> 24:44.730
No.
No, not really.

24:44.930 --> 24:46.420
Why?

24:46.620 --> 24:48.030
- My phone and my backpack,
they were with me.

24:48.230 --> 24:49.780
Ugh.

24:49.970 --> 24:51.430
The tickets are
in here somewhere.

24:51.630 --> 24:52.040
I printed them
out this morning.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.780
[phone chimes]

24:53.980 --> 24:55.170
Aha.

24:55.370 --> 24:56.780
Here they are.

24:56.980 --> 24:59.350
Oh, shit.

24:59.550 --> 25:01.000
Uh, I can't make it tonight.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.530
Come on.

25:02.730 --> 25:03.310
Sorry, I completely spaced.

25:03.510 --> 25:04.880
I have band practice.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.970
- Wouldn't it be easier
just to tell me that you

25:07.170 --> 25:08.100
- don't want to see this movie?
- That is not it, OK?

25:08.300 --> 25:09.800
I do.

25:09.990 --> 25:10.880
It's just-- it's the only
night we could do it.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.320
And you know what they say.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.930
What do they say?

25:15.130 --> 25:17.280
- Bros before strong,
independent women

25:17.480 --> 25:18.410
with bright futures.

25:18.610 --> 25:19.810
It's a very popular phrase.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.720
You're stupid.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.500
You're lucky you're cute.

25:23.700 --> 25:25.900
- What the Lord deny in
brain, He deliver in beauty.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.940
And boy, did He deny.

25:28.140 --> 25:29.700

26:06.120 --> 26:10.680

26:10.880 --> 26:12.810
I have to go take care
of some things.

26:13.010 --> 26:14.130
Are you OK?

26:15.790 --> 26:18.470
- And I'm missing
my necklace too.

26:18.670 --> 26:19.470
Huh.

26:19.670 --> 26:22.170
- Can you please
stop saying huh?

26:22.370 --> 26:24.350
Hey.

26:24.550 --> 26:28.310
Maybe it's a good thing you
don't remember everything, OK?

26:28.510 --> 26:30.190
Sometimes I wish
I could forget.

26:38.810 --> 26:41.150
Xavier?

26:41.350 --> 26:42.450
Xavier, listen to me.

26:42.650 --> 26:45.020
They let you out?

26:45.220 --> 26:46.410
Just leave me alone.

26:46.610 --> 26:50.500
- You had her phone
for three days.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.160
Why didn't you say anything?

26:52.360 --> 26:53.810
- I don't have to
tell you anything.

26:54.010 --> 26:56.730
- Why don't you
just come clean?

26:56.930 --> 26:58.730
Spare us having to
force it out of you.

26:58.930 --> 26:59.910
- Who's going to force
it out of me, Simon?

27:00.100 --> 27:00.910
- You?
- Hey.

27:01.110 --> 27:01.790
Chill out.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.740
- [yells]
- Simon, enough!

27:08.940 --> 27:09.740
Hey, you two!

27:09.940 --> 27:10.790
Stop!

27:10.980 --> 27:12.050
Knock it off!

27:12.250 --> 27:13.400
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Knock it off!

27:13.600 --> 27:14.440
Stop, stop!

27:14.640 --> 27:16.620
Xavier, please stop!

27:16.820 --> 27:17.790
Stop it!

27:17.990 --> 27:18.880
What do you kids
think you're doing?

27:19.080 --> 27:20.320
Are you OK?

27:20.520 --> 27:21.620
- Don't give me another
reason to expel you.

27:21.820 --> 27:22.620
Are you OK?

27:22.820 --> 27:23.970
Let me see.

27:24.170 --> 27:25.600
- You still wonder where
the blood came from?

27:32.300 --> 27:34.500
[indistinct chatter]

27:34.700 --> 27:35.900
- Maddie?
Hello.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.290
We-- we just
started the session.

27:37.490 --> 27:38.290
- You want to
help me, big shot?

27:38.490 --> 27:39.990
Fine.
Help me.

27:40.190 --> 27:41.510
I need you to force a
confession out of someone.

27:41.710 --> 27:42.770
You know, rattle some chains.

27:42.970 --> 27:43.640
Inhabit his body.

27:43.840 --> 27:44.820
Scare the life out of him.

27:45.020 --> 27:48.340
Whatever it takes.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.220
What's the problem?

27:50.420 --> 27:52.130
I need you to channel
all your ghostly energy

27:52.330 --> 27:54.180
and dangle this sack of shit
out of a window until

27:54.380 --> 27:55.310
he cracks.

27:55.510 --> 27:56.610
OK, you're not getting it.

27:56.810 --> 27:58.530
That's not how this works, OK?

27:58.730 --> 28:00.100
It's not like in the movies.

28:00.290 --> 28:01.270
We couldn't do that,
even if we wanted to.

28:01.470 --> 28:02.320
And I do want to.

28:02.510 --> 28:04.190
Yeah.

28:04.390 --> 28:05.710
Maybe you're all fine just
accepting this, but I'm not.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.540
I need to know what happened.

28:07.740 --> 28:09.930
- We're not in some
haunted house, chick.

28:10.130 --> 28:12.280
Maybe this doesn't
jive with your fantasy

28:12.480 --> 28:13.810
of what this should be,
but we're

28:14.000 --> 28:15.500
quite literally a world away.

28:15.700 --> 28:16.940
We're not there.
We're here.

28:17.140 --> 28:17.940
Stuck.

28:18.140 --> 28:18.980
No.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.900
Not good enough.

28:21.100 --> 28:21.380
You know, if my friends can't
get the truth out of him,

28:21.580 --> 28:23.640
then I have to.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.160
- What you're feeling right now
is absolutely natural, Maddie.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.560
You're longing for
a sense of control.

28:26.760 --> 28:27.730
We've all been there.

28:27.930 --> 28:30.000
Talking through it can help.

28:30.190 --> 28:31.910
I wasn't ready to die.

28:32.110 --> 28:34.350
Talking about it
won't change anything.

28:34.550 --> 28:36.920
If I have to search this entire
town for answers, I'll do it.

28:37.110 --> 28:39.050
I'm not willing to just give
up, like the rest of you.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.830
We're not giving up.

28:41.030 --> 28:42.180
- We're moving forward.
- Yeah?

28:42.380 --> 28:43.970
Well, for a guy who's
supposed to be getting

28:44.160 --> 28:45.100
people out of here,
this still looks

28:45.300 --> 28:47.670
like a pretty crowded room.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.010
I'm getting the hell
out of this place.
