And that group of stars

00:56.991 --> 01:01.994
Yeah, it looks like a scoop that
you dip into a bag of pup food.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.729
(Laughing)

01:03.731 --> 01:07.499
Uh-oh, part of the Dipper's
handle fell off.

01:08.402 --> 01:12.438
Hmm, that doesn't look like
a star to me,

01:12.440 --> 01:15.941
it looks like some kind
of spaceship.

01:15.943 --> 01:16.975
Cool!
Cool!

01:16.977 --> 01:19.478
It's headed
right for Adventure Bay!

(Screaming)

02:04.725 --> 02:08.827
Bettina? How did you get up
in that whatever-that-is?

02:08.829 --> 02:14.266
I'd help you down,
but I don't know how, brown cow.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.802
But I know who to call!

02:17.705 --> 02:18.604
Where'd the spaceship go?

02:18.606 --> 02:22.407
It disappeared
near Farmer Yumi's.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.575
(Phone ringing)

02:23.577 --> 02:24.276
Ryder here.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.112
<i> Oh, Ryder, the most bizarre</i>
<i> thing has just happened.</i>

02:27.114 --> 02:29.314
<i> You're not going</i>
<i> to believe this.</i>

02:29.316 --> 02:31.850
Whoa, that's weird,
and kind of cool.

02:31.852 --> 02:35.554
<i> can you help poor Bettina and</i>
<i> find out what's going on here?</i>

02:35.556 --> 02:37.389
We're on it,

Hey, who
turned off the lights?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.275
And the stars and the moon?

02:56.277 --> 02:58.410
Hurry, Marshall!

02:58.412 --> 02:59.778
Coming!

03:01.048 --> 03:04.216
Hey! Who put
a building right here?

Action, Ryder, Sir.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.878
Sorry to wake you pups.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.513
We were looking at the stars

03:34.515 --> 03:36.281
when something
fell from the sky.

03:36.283 --> 03:39.117
It landed somewhere near
Farmer Yumi's.

03:39.119 --> 03:39.952
What was it?

03:39.954 --> 03:43.622
It looked kind of like
a spaceship.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.290
ALL:
Ooh!

03:45.292 --> 03:49.194
Mayor Goodway showed
us something really weird.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.096
Bettina in midair!

03:51.098 --> 03:52.030
A flying cow?

03:52.032 --> 03:54.466
"Utterly" preposterous.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.968
(All laughing)

03:55.970 --> 03:56.735
What's so funny?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.905
Yep. For this mission,
I'll need...

04:00.107 --> 04:02.641
Chase, we can use
your special spy skills and gear

04:02.643 --> 04:05.544
to help find the pilot
of the spacecraft.

04:05.546 --> 04:08.914
Yes! Super Spy Chase
is on the case!

04:08.916 --> 04:11.550
Excellent!
Next I'll need...

04:11.552 --> 04:13.518
Rocky, you're
my ace fix-it pup.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.722
You can fix whatever it is
that fell from the sky.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.290
Green means glow!

04:18.292 --> 04:19.791
(All laughing)

04:19.793 --> 04:21.026
I still don't get it.

04:21.028 --> 04:24.663

(Mooing)

05:34.401 --> 05:35.600
(All gasping)

05:35.602 --> 05:37.836
Weird. How does
she stay up there?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.104
I don't know,
but I think

05:39.106 --> 05:41.707
this might have
something to do with it.

05:41.709 --> 05:45.811
Chase, use your zip-line suction
cup to get Bettina down.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.713
Will do, Ryder, Sir!

05:47.715 --> 05:49.181
(Barking)

05:49.183 --> 05:50.449
Zip-line.

Perfect.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.987
Now, let's get her
out of that bubble.

05:55.989 --> 05:59.191
Three, two, pull!

06:00.194 --> 06:01.526
Uh-oh!
Run!

06:03.931 --> 06:04.529
Are you okay?

06:04.531 --> 06:07.399
Now I know what
a pancake feels like.

06:07.401 --> 06:07.933
He's okay.

06:07.935 --> 06:10.135
Chase, I need you
to use your spy gear

06:10.137 --> 06:12.571
to find the pilot
of that spaceship.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.172
Yes, Sir, Ryder, Sir.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.240
(Barking)

06:15.242 --> 06:17.075
Night vision goggles.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.510

what you find.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.812
(Sniffing)

06:22.282 --> 06:23.515
CHASE:
Strange tracks.

06:23.517 --> 06:27.719
I wonder what kind of
weird creature made those.

06:28.422 --> 06:29.988
Chickaletta!

06:29.990 --> 06:30.756
Here, Chickaletta!

06:30.758 --> 06:33.592
You mustn't
run away from Mommy.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.394
(Chattering)

06:35.396 --> 06:36.962
Oh, that doesn't sound right.

06:36.964 --> 06:37.996
My chicken--

06:37.998 --> 06:38.897
(Imitating chicken)

06:38.899 --> 06:40.165
Not "meep, meep, meeps".

06:40.167 --> 06:42.968
(Clucking)

06:42.970 --> 06:44.703
Oh, there you are.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.172
(Vocalizing)
Oh, dear.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.841
Oh, my!

06:49.843 --> 06:52.644
Oh, I can see my house
from up here.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.980
(Chattering)

06:55.816 --> 06:58.683
The tracks go here
and just stop.

06:58.685 --> 06:59.584
What happened to them?

06:59.586 --> 07:02.788
Chase!
Yoo-hoo, Chase, up here!

07:02.790 --> 07:05.524
Mayor Goodway?
Where are you?

07:05.526 --> 07:06.792
Up here!

07:06.794 --> 07:07.793
(Gasping)

07:07.795 --> 07:08.960
How did you get up there?

07:08.962 --> 07:11.096
A little green space alien
beamed us up.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.633
A real space alien?
I've got to see this.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.734
(Loudly clearing throat)

07:15.736 --> 07:19.771
Still floating in an alien light
bubble up here.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.606
Oops. Sorry, Mayor.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.741
(Barking)

07:22.743 --> 07:24.609
Net!

07:25.712 --> 07:26.645
Ah!

07:26.647 --> 07:27.679
Ready, Mayor?

07:27.681 --> 07:30.582
One, two, three!

07:30.584 --> 07:31.616
(Grunting)

07:31.618 --> 07:33.351
Whoa!

07:33.353 --> 07:35.153
Nice catch, Chase.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.422
Thanks.

07:37.858 --> 07:42.928
Some kind of antenna came off
here, that landing wheel's flat,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.663
and some small wings
came off here.

07:44.665 --> 07:47.432
Do you have enough parts
for all these repairs?

07:47.434 --> 07:50.101
I've got a whole
truck full of stuff.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.671
Don't lose it, re-use it!

07:54.174 --> 07:56.708
All right,
now which way did he go?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.276
He went thataway.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.110
(Barking)

07:59.112 --> 08:01.379
Night vision goggles!

08:05.919 --> 08:07.586
A round, green head!

08:07.588 --> 08:10.655
Oops, it's just a melon.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.693
Melon, melon, melon,
space alien.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.727
Melon.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.761
(Gasping)

08:16.763 --> 08:17.796
Space alien!

08:17.798 --> 08:18.864
(Vocalizing)

08:18.866 --> 08:23.301
Sorry. I don't understand
what you're saying.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.538
Whoa!

08:30.177 --> 08:32.110
Great idea to fix
the landing gear

08:32.112 --> 08:33.979
with that
bicycle wheel, Rocky.

08:33.981 --> 08:34.646
Thanks, Ryder.

08:34.648 --> 08:38.049
This hanger should make
a pretty good antenna.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.317
Looks like
we're done here.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.419
I'll go check on Chase.

08:41.421 --> 08:43.488
(Grunting)

08:43.490 --> 08:44.890
Help, help!

08:44.892 --> 08:46.258
Anybody?

08:46.260 --> 08:47.459
(Sighing)

08:47.461 --> 08:51.329
If I can pull Bettina
and the mayor free,

08:51.331 --> 08:54.065
I can pull myself out too.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.300
(Barking)

08:55.302 --> 08:56.968
Zip-line!

08:59.706 --> 09:02.407
Gotcha!

09:02.409 --> 09:04.543
Yes!

09:04.545 --> 09:06.678
Whoo-hoo!

09:07.481 --> 09:08.313
That's better.

09:08.315 --> 09:12.117
Now, where did
that space alien go?

09:12.119 --> 09:14.452
(Chattering)

09:17.057 --> 09:18.623
Oh!

09:24.364 --> 09:25.030
(Sniffing)

09:25.032 --> 09:26.598
Hey, Chase,
how goes the search?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.767
Great! I found a melon
that was actually an alien,

09:28.769 --> 09:30.535
and then he zapped me
with this cool bubble thing,

09:30.537 --> 09:32.537
and I floated in the air
like "Whoa!"

09:32.539 --> 09:35.941
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's the alien now?

09:35.943 --> 09:36.741
(Ringing)

09:36.743 --> 09:38.510
Hey, Skye.
What's up?

09:38.512 --> 09:41.379
<i> We've got a visitor</i>
<i> in the Lookout.</i>

09:42.749 --> 09:46.885
And I bet I know who it is.
We're on our way.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.025
(Barking)

09:56.229 --> 09:57.429
(All gasping)

09:57.431 --> 10:00.131
(Vocalizing)

10:00.133 --> 10:02.667
The Lookout looks so much
like a spaceship,

10:02.669 --> 10:05.670
he's trying
to fly it home.

10:06.773 --> 10:10.041
Sorry, buddy,
it just won't work.

10:10.043 --> 10:10.942
(Sighing)

10:10.944 --> 10:12.877
(Chattering sadly)

10:12.879 --> 10:17.649
Something else is bothering
the poor little green guy.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.986
(Vocalizing)

10:21.421 --> 10:23.955
Aww, I think
that's his mom.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.424
And I bet
he's really missing her.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.492
Not for long.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.662
Rocky, how's it going?
Are you close?

10:30.664 --> 10:32.631
<i> I'm close, all right. Look.</i>

10:32.633 --> 10:34.399
(Engines humming)

10:34.401 --> 10:36.835
(Exclaiming)

10:37.604 --> 10:38.903
He fixed it!

10:38.905 --> 10:40.905
(Exclaiming)

10:40.907 --> 10:43.475
Whenever you're in trouble,
just yelp--

10:43.477 --> 10:46.478
Or "beep, beep, beep"--
For help!

10:46.480 --> 10:47.646
Come on!

10:47.648 --> 10:49.948
(Laughing)

¶ Alien! ¶

10:59.259 --> 11:06.164
¶

11:06.166 --> 11:09.601
Whoa! They're flying
in a spaceship.

11:09.603 --> 11:10.969
How cool is that?

11:10.971 --> 11:12.837
Yeah!
Cool!

11:14.574 --> 11:16.341
(Yelling)

11:18.445 --> 11:21.613
Not as cool as us
flying in the spaceship.

11:21.615 --> 11:22.747
Whoo-hoo!

11:22.749 --> 11:25.483
(All exclaiming)

11:27.954 --> 11:32.624
¶ You're all good pups
and you saved the day ¶

11:32.626 --> 11:36.494
¶ And now it's time
to play around Adventure Bay ¶

¶ P-p-p-Paw Paw
Paw Patrol ¶

11:53.747 --> 11:57.382
Just like this!

11:57.384 --> 11:59.017
Marshall,
what are you doing?

11:59.019 --> 12:02.620
Training Smiley,
my championship jumping frog.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.756
Well, he will be a champion

12:04.758 --> 12:08.626
after he wins
the Frogapalooza contest today.

12:08.628 --> 12:12.030
The frog who jumps the farthest
is the winner.

12:12.032 --> 12:15.967
I'm training Smiley
to jump like this!

12:15.969 --> 12:17.168
Whoa!

12:17.170 --> 12:18.369
Oof!

12:20.173 --> 12:22.273
Hey, my lunch!

12:22.275 --> 12:23.475
I'm good.

12:23.477 --> 12:26.845
He already seems pretty good
at jumping.

12:27.914 --> 12:28.980
(Gasping)

12:28.982 --> 12:30.215
Uh-oh!

12:31.618 --> 12:33.918
Follow that frog!

12:33.920 --> 12:35.086
(Barking)

12:35.088 --> 12:37.288
Tool Arm away.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.758
Looks secure, Rocky.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.727
Uh-oh!

12:45.499 --> 12:47.031
Uck!

12:47.033 --> 12:47.565
(Laughing)

12:47.567 --> 12:52.103
Marshall, maybe you can
train Smiley somewhere else.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.506
Come on, Smiley.
Let's go.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.307
Hey, he listened.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.576
For once.

12:59.279 --> 13:03.748
He's heading for the elevator.
Smiley, stop!

13:06.319 --> 13:07.552
Whoa!

13:09.289 --> 13:11.990
I'm okay.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.305
(Ribbitting)

13:32.479 --> 13:34.045
Gotcha!

13:34.714 --> 13:37.148
Okay, that was just practice.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.651
Now I've got you!

13:39.653 --> 13:41.119
You're mine now!

13:41.121 --> 13:44.789
You can hop
but you can't hide.

13:44.791 --> 13:47.725
Or maybe you can hide.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.328
Smiley, Smiley!

13:51.498 --> 13:53.498
Now I gotcha!

13:54.835 --> 13:56.534
Whoa!

13:56.536 --> 13:57.969
(Crashing)

13:58.605 --> 14:01.806
Tricked
by my own treats.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.114
No, Smiley,
not down the slide!

Look out below!

¶ Marshall! ¶

14:34.274 --> 14:35.273
Oops.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.141
Uh, Ryder?

14:37.143 --> 14:38.776
We've got a problem.

14:38.778 --> 14:39.510
Don't worry, Rubble.

14:39.512 --> 14:43.381
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.185
PAW Patrol
to the Lookout.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.621
BOTH:
Ryder needs us.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.826
Thanks for the lift, Rubble.

14:54.828 --> 14:56.928
Any time, Marshall.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.230
(Laughing)

15:13.680 --> 15:16.047
Ready for action, Ryder, Sir.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.516
Pups, we've got
a high-flying problem:

15:18.518 --> 15:22.153
Marshall's frog flew off
in Skye's helicopter.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.422
And I'm sure he doesn't have
his flying license.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.293
And it's almost time for
the frog jumping contest.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.827
(Laughing)

15:30.096 --> 15:32.397
Skye, I need you
to use your wings

15:32.399 --> 15:33.998
to fly up to
your helicopter.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.367
You'll have to get in
and take control.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.435
(Gasping)

15:37.437 --> 15:38.503
Yippee!

15:38.505 --> 15:40.705
This pup's gotta fly!

15:40.707 --> 15:42.373
You'll have to
do it before my--

15:42.375 --> 15:46.911
I mean, Smiley's--
turn to jump.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.780
Chase, I need you
to use your cones

15:48.782 --> 15:50.682
to make a safe route
to the starting line.

15:50.684 --> 15:53.651
Use your megaphone and siren
to keep cars and people

15:53.653 --> 15:55.053
away from the area.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.255
Chase is on the case.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.456
Need anyone else, Ryder?

15:58.458 --> 16:02.427
Like a spotted Dalmatian
with a fire truck?

16:02.429 --> 16:06.097
Hmm. Let me see...

16:06.099 --> 16:07.398
Marshall.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.399
Yes!

16:08.401 --> 16:10.335
(Howling)

16:10.337 --> 16:12.937
I need you to get to
the frog jumping contest.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.473
Hopefully Smiley
will get there in time.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.041
I'm fired up.

16:17.043 --> 16:20.678
All right!

Huh? Where's my copter?

17:37.123 --> 17:41.125
Spotted Smiley headed toward
the middle of the bridge.

17:41.127 --> 17:43.227
We're on it.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.067
Do you see them, Chase?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.368
Negative.

Behind you!

17:55.575 --> 17:56.374

I got you.

18:02.615 --> 18:06.084
It takes way more than that
to scare me.

18:06.086 --> 18:10.855
I know, Chase.
You can get down now.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.291
Huh?
Oh, right.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.130
Wings.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.368
No, Smiley,
no a loop-de-loop.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.671
Whoa!

18:26.673 --> 18:31.109
Wow, it took me years
to learn how to do that.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.718
Hi, Alex.
Hey, Mr. Porter.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.953
Hi, Marshall.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.754
Check this out!

18:44.791 --> 18:47.258
That's quite a jumper
you've got, Alex.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.360
He might
even come in second.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.995
BOTH:
Ooh!

18:50.997 --> 18:56.334
This is Jumpy Jumper.
He's going to come in first.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.336
Where's your frog?

18:58.338 --> 19:03.040
He's, uh, on the way,
I hope.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.408
Mayor Goodway, Mayor Goodway!

19:04.410 --> 19:06.744
Can you tell me
when Smiley's supposed to jump?

19:06.746 --> 19:10.081
Certainly, Marshall.
Let's see...

19:10.083 --> 19:13.284
Oh, Smiley is the last
jumper in the contest.

19:13.286 --> 19:16.621
Last? Yes!
He can still make it.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.522
Who can
still make it?

19:17.524 --> 19:20.958
My frog. He's flying over here
in a helicopter.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.629
I see.
Wait, what?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.667
Easy, Smiley.

Whoa!

<i> That's great, Skye.</i>

And just in time.

19:41.447 --> 19:43.247
Oh, no, I can't see!

Go higher!
Pull up!

19:46.386 --> 19:48.686
Stay back! Whoa!

19:51.991 --> 19:54.192
Whoo-hoo!
She made it!

19:55.361 --> 19:56.627

19:56.629 --> 19:58.496
I knew she would.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.133
Oh, yeah,
that's the spot.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.703
She cleared the lighthouse!

20:05.705 --> 20:07.805
Yeah, Skye!

(Howling)

20:09.375 --> 20:09.840
Whoa!

20:09.842 --> 20:14.845
Our next contestant
is Alex's frog Jumpy Jumper.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.147

20:16.149 --> 20:18.316
Go Jumpy Jumper!

20:18.318 --> 20:22.887
Ryder, is Skye going to make it?
Smiley's jumping next!

20:22.889 --> 20:24.855
Hang on, Marshall,
let me check.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.991
Skye, Smiley jumps next.

20:26.993 --> 20:32.296
Roger that. Okay, Smiley,
no more messing around.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.331
Heel.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.065
(Barking)

20:34.067 --> 20:37.735
That's better.
We're heading to the field.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.904
Okay, we'll meet you there.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.840
Chase, let's roll.

20:44.544 --> 20:47.511

20:47.513 --> 20:49.647
Let's go watch Smiley jump!

20:49.649 --> 20:51.916

20:54.721 --> 20:58.723
Easy, Smiley.
We're almost there.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.625
No, I said easy.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.426
Heel. Sit. Stay.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.262
Ryder, he's out
on the wing.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.530
<i> I'm afraid he's</i>
<i> going to jump too soon.</i>

21:06.532 --> 21:08.366
Fly as low
as you can, Skye.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.269
Chase, stay under
the helicopter.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.272
He jumped!

21:15.875 --> 21:19.944
Nice work, Skye.
Chase is on the case.

21:19.946 --> 21:20.978
(Barking)

21:20.980 --> 21:22.046
Megaphone!

21:22.048 --> 21:24.849
<i> Stay clear! Emergency!</i>

21:24.851 --> 21:28.853
<i> Very important frog</i>
<i> coming through!</i>

21:30.590 --> 21:34.058
Smiley!

21:34.060 --> 21:35.760
(Snoring)

21:35.762 --> 21:39.563
I guess flying a helicopter
really tires out a frog.

21:39.565 --> 21:44.435
The next jumper is Marshall's
frog, Smiley.

21:44.437 --> 21:47.505
(Cheering)

21:47.507 --> 21:48.572
Go, Smiley!

21:48.574 --> 21:51.442
(Snoring)

21:51.444 --> 21:55.413
Come on, Smiley,
you've got to jump! Wake up!

21:55.415 --> 21:57.048
It's time!

21:57.050 --> 21:58.816
Chase, megaphone!

21:58.818 --> 21:59.850

Great jump!

22:08.227 --> 22:10.861
Ooh, that was a good one.

22:10.863 --> 22:14.298
The winner is Smiley!

22:14.300 --> 22:18.636
(Cheering)

22:18.638 --> 22:19.403
Smiley did it!

22:19.405 --> 22:21.806
Thanks, pups.
Thanks, Ryder.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.575
Whenever you're in trouble,
just yelp--

22:24.577 --> 22:25.509
(Ribbitting)

22:25.511 --> 22:27.278
Or ribbit for help!

22:27.280 --> 22:29.080

You can stop jumping now.
