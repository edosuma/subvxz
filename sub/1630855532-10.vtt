I hope in 20 years,

21:29.164 --> 21:31.416
- In a week, but just by myself.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.418
Yeah, Ruby can't take
any more time off work.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.003
But she said to go and experience it,

21:35.003 --> 21:38.924
that, you know,
it'd be good for my soul and shit.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.343

Ruby, she's fine as fuck.

I'd definitely hit that.
