00:17.160 --> 00:18.760
<i>Previously on Babylon Berlin.</i>

00:19.000 --> 00:21.600
<i>Fifteen executed revolutionaries</i>
<i>of the Red Fortress.</i>

00:23.280 --> 00:24.840
We confiscated the weapons
of these gentlemen.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.800
There were projectiles from those guns
in almost all of the bodies.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.600
I want to propose a deal.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.920
<i>I want the names</i>
<i>of those responsible of the Reichswehr</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:34.160
<i>who organize the transport</i>
<i>of the poison gas.</i>

00:34.240 --> 00:36.880
You want me to deliver
your own countrymen?

00:37.080 --> 00:39.760
Your confiscation of the train
causes tension.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.520
That you Soviets are eager
to help build up the illegal <i>Reichswehr</i>

00:44.600 --> 00:45.840
is a matter in itself.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.880
But that even our head of state
doesn't shy away

00:48.960 --> 00:51.360
from ignoring the Treaty of Versailles...

00:52.760 --> 00:53.920
<i>This is Bruno.</i>

00:54.000 --> 00:56.440
You can deliver the shipment.
You know where the key is.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.320
The foreman found a human foot
in the foundation yesterday morning.

01:01.400 --> 01:04.920
They found a body whose clothes
make an unambiguous attribution possible.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.800
<i>The man must have been a priest.</i>

01:06.880 --> 01:08.880
<i>-Has he been identified?</i>
<i>-Saint Josef.</i>

01:10.560 --> 01:11.840
Get yourself a radio by tomorrow.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.880
23 MAY, 2 P.M., 709 KHZ

01:16.320 --> 01:18.120
-Help!
-Did you know one of them?

01:18.200 --> 01:19.880
That's not the point. Come.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.760
I can't. I have to work.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.480
<i>Then tell those murderers at home</i>
<i>what you saw.</i>

01:43.920 --> 01:48.400
SOVIET EMBASSY
MITTE, BERLIN

02:29.560 --> 02:32.200
<i>Inspector Rath, I have the documents.</i>

02:32.280 --> 02:35.280
<i>In an hour,</i>
<i>at Friedrichstrasse train station.</i>

02:54.280 --> 02:55.760
-Henning?
-What?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.120
Everything alright?

02:58.760 --> 03:00.280
-Yes!
-Just asking.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.480
Oh man.

03:14.880 --> 03:15.760
Hey, mister.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.560
Keep walking.

03:17.960 --> 03:20.480
French for one mark,
peeling the banana for two.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.600
Get lost.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.680
Come on. Fudge tunnel for one fifty.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.000
Get lost, man.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.360
He's no good. With me
you get anything for one mark.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.560
-He's mine!
-Shut up, you squirt.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.520
If you don't want to go to jail,
make like a tree and leave.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.040
-Get it?
-A copper?

03:37.240 --> 03:38.760
-Get marching.
-A copper!

03:39.680 --> 03:40.880
A vice copper!

03:42.880 --> 03:45.480
-Coppers!
-Come on, let's scram.

04:19.680 --> 04:20.800
What is this?

04:20.880 --> 04:24.720
A visa application.
Not just any old visa application.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.680
There are several dozens of those,
for this man alone, Major Beck.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.120
-I know him.
-You probably know this one, too.

04:34.480 --> 04:35.600
Seegers.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
What's going on?

04:38.320 --> 04:40.120
First you let my men go.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.080
Then you'll get evidence
against your general staff.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.680
Fifteen of them.

04:47.600 --> 04:48.800
<i>Do ut des.</i>

04:49.680 --> 04:51.280
I give so you give.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.520
Off we go.

05:08.440 --> 05:09.520
Get out, gentlemen.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.040
Ah, finally.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.720
With these documents
you will be able to prove

05:28.800 --> 05:33.080
that since 1925 these officers
have very regularly been visiting

05:33.160 --> 05:38.240
a small village 300 km southeast of Moscow
called Lipetsk.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.640
It's the secret base
of the German Air Force.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.280
There has been no German Air Force
since the end of the war.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.320
There is one in Lipetsk.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.560
I don't understand you.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.800
You work against your own country.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.480
I work for the police.

07:00.360 --> 07:05.880
LOUDSPEAKER

07:10.800 --> 07:14.440
23 MAY, 2 P.M., 709 KHZ

<i>...picture the analysis of a patient</i>
<i>as something</i> <i>which follows similar</i>
<i>mechanisms as this radio program.</i>

07:28.920 --> 07:32.760
<i>In both cases, you have transmission</i>
<i>and counter-transmission.</i>

07:33.520 --> 07:36.760
<i>In the case of our work</i>
<i>with traumatized front soldiers</i>

07:36.840 --> 07:40.400
<i>it's a transmission</i>

07:41.280 --> 07:44.160
<i>All processes in our brain work</i>

07:44.240 --> 07:47.440
according to the principles
of electrophysiology.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.960
They are basically
nothing but electric currents

07:51.040 --> 07:53.920
which signal an activity

07:54.000 --> 07:58.800
<i>to our brain</i>
<i>and to what we call our consciousness.</i>

08:00.120 --> 08:01.280

08:02.040 --> 08:03.480
<i>I wonder,</i>

08:04.120 --> 08:06.920
<i>why shouldn't the thoughts between two</i>

08:07.000 --> 08:10.920
separate people be transferred by way

08:11.600 --> 08:17.640
<i>of one of them transmitting radio waves</i>
<i>when thinking</i>

08:17.720 --> 08:20.400
and the other one receives them directly

08:21.040 --> 08:25.120
and then identifies them as his own.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.960
<i>Please note</i>
<i>that this procedure is called...</i>

08:30.200 --> 08:32.360
suggestive therapy.

08:55.720 --> 08:59.120
-Right, here you go.
-Thank you.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.440
What do I owe you?

09:04.280 --> 09:05.160
Is something wrong?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.720
No, everything is fine.

09:08.440 --> 09:09.840
I feel a bit queer, is all.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.160
Get well soon.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.840
Yes, you too.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.760
We can apply for the arrest warrants
straight away.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.280
Against whom?

09:34.360 --> 09:36.960
Seegers, von Loitzing, Major Beck,
half the general staff.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.280
-What for?
-Constitutional breach,

09:39.360 --> 09:43.200
treason, conspiracy against the republic.
The list goes on.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.560
Will that be enough in court?

09:47.760 --> 09:48.800
Hard to say.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.120
If anyone can say,
it's you, the public prosecutor.

09:52.200 --> 09:55.120
They ship 13 wagons full of phosgene
to Berlin,

09:55.200 --> 09:57.560
not even a year
after the disgrace of Hamburg.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.080
-What happened in Hamburg?
-The Stoltzenberg chemical works.

10:01.160 --> 10:05.680
The valve of a tank wagon burst.
What came out? Poison gas, phosgene.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.320
There were ten dead,
hundreds severely injured. People left their houses
and dropped to the ground.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.880
Who was the gas for?

10:13.440 --> 10:14.840
Why don't you guess?

10:15.920 --> 10:17.720
-The Reichswehr.
-Well...

10:18.240 --> 10:19.400
not officially.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.720
And no consequences?

10:20.800 --> 10:24.520
The chemical plant dumped the other wagons
in the sea and now they want compensation.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.840
This shows that we need more
if we want to crackdown on these people.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.920
I don't want that paperwork
thrown back in my face.

10:31.600 --> 10:36.520
These documents are proof
of a German base in the Soviet Union,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.880
where German pilots are trained to become
fighter pilots by German experts.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.160
In German fighter planes.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.720
-Where is this supposed to be?
-In Lipetsk.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.360
It's 300 km southeast of Moscow.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.960
And what's in it for the Russians,
helping us to breach the treaty?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.680
The Russians want
to build airplane engines.

10:56.760 --> 10:59.080
They're learning that
from German engineers.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.840
How big is this thing in Lipetsk,
that flying squadron?

11:03.520 --> 11:05.680
After all, it may just be
a handful of machinery.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.960
The informant says
it's a lot more than just a few.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.680
But these papers don't prove that.
They suggest it, but...

11:13.200 --> 11:15.520
Your Honor, please.
What else do you need?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.680
Witnesses, files, photographs.

11:24.840 --> 11:26.720
-I'll do it.
-You will do what?

11:26.800 --> 11:27.640
I'll go there.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.800
Garbage. You'll travel for a week
and no one will let you in.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.640
He'll fly then.

11:34.440 --> 11:35.280
What?

11:36.560 --> 11:37.800
Well, it's simple.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.960
You'll get us a plane and we'll get proof.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.760
-Doris.
-Lottchen, you have to rescue me.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.600
-What's the matter?
-Invoices.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.920
From a clothes factory, called Sklarek.
They list every single sock,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.320
every shako and every uniform. Every
service textile of the police since 1924,

12:01.400 --> 12:05.080
and I'm supposed to check them all.
It must be at least 400 pages.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.560
But that's great,
you'll need days for that.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.600
But I don't know how to do sums.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.840
You have to help me.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.800
Like I helped you. 80 Pfennig an hour.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.560
-What exactly do you have to do?
-You'll do it?

12:23.000 --> 12:23.840
And again.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.760
I don't believe this.

12:26.560 --> 12:27.520
Write this down.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.720
Delivery note 219/27, Spandau town hall.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.480
Forty-six offices, taking down
and cleaning net curtains.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.880
And here, four days later, the invoice.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.200
Four hundred sixty offices,
taking down and cleaning net curtains,

12:43.280 --> 12:46.080
at nine marks each, that's 4140 marks.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.400
So they're invoicing
for ten times the amount.

12:49.920 --> 12:53.000
I'd say they're pretty cheeky,
those Sklarek brothers.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.920
I'd say the same.

12:59.040 --> 12:59.880
No!

13:02.200 --> 13:03.440
What does it say on the door?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.440
Oh, inspector.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.480
-Is everything destroyed now?
-No.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.520
Yes. I'm sorry.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.400
Two questions, Mr. Gräf.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.240
-First of all, where is Jänicke?
-Didn't turn up today.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.680
We were supposed to meet at Aschinger's.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.800
And the second question?

13:29.080 --> 13:30.680
Have you ever been on a plane?

13:36.880 --> 13:38.800
-What is it?
-These are documents which...

13:38.880 --> 13:40.840
OK, I'll check them later.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.480
-This should explained.
-By you, you mean?

13:43.560 --> 13:46.800
-Yes, there are certain payments...
-Have them pay you,

13:46.880 --> 13:48.160
I'll look at it later.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.520
You can leave now.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.720
Fritz, you scared me.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.760
Sorry.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.240
Why did you do that?

14:15.320 --> 14:16.440
Come on.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.120
Hang on a second.

14:20.120 --> 14:22.360
-What is it?
-What you said on that funeral march...

14:24.480 --> 14:26.080
Mr. Benda is not a murderer.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.000
Oh, Mr. Benda.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.720
Is he nice to you, yeah?

14:31.560 --> 14:33.800
No, but he has a good heart. I know that.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.960
Gretchen, that may be so. But he's
also the chief of the political police.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.880
And his good heart, however big it may be,

14:41.960 --> 14:43.680
he has to leave in the cloakroom
outside his office.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.600
And at night he picks it up again.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.680
And in between
he has us communists slaughtered.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.680
PROPERTY OF THE BERLIN POLICE

16:28.920 --> 16:29.840
Moritz!

16:32.200 --> 16:33.040
Senior? What are you doing?

16:36.720 --> 16:37.560
Nothing.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.440
Where did you get the key from?

16:42.640 --> 16:44.520
You can't sniff around like this.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.640
I didn't.

16:46.400 --> 16:49.280
Lock it up right away
and put the key back where you found it.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.040
Where is your mother?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.640
Shopping with Mrs. Wolter.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.160
Off you go.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.120
There, in front.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.080
COMMUNIST UNREST ON 1 MAY
THE VIOLENCE ESCALATES

17:44.920 --> 17:47.880
FOREIGN MINISTER STRESEMANN
WELCOMES BRIAND IN BERLIN.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.320
Communist kisses chambermaid.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.240
And on the next floor the hairdressers
and four bespoke tailors, not just one.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.120
-And they have beauty advice everywhere.
-Can I have the sausage?

18:39.200 --> 18:41.880
And it's all free.
Emmi and I have tried it all.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.480
And then there were two jewelers
or even three with long glass counters,

18:45.560 --> 18:48.480
and then, when we took the escalator
up to second floor,

18:48.560 --> 18:51.640
there was a fashion show starting
in the ladies' department.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.080
So beautiful! <i>Dernier cri.</i>

18:54.160 --> 18:57.120
That means the latest trend.
From Paris for <i>madame.</i>

18:57.200 --> 18:59.320
Oh, if only I was 20 and had some money.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.600
You don't look like you're 50
and have no money, Helga.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.760
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.240
Cheers.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.600
-Oh God, it's empty again.
-To your health.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.400
Has it got worse?

19:25.440 --> 19:26.280
Different.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.280
-Worse?
-No, just different.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.080
<i>Gereon!</i>

19:49.600 --> 19:50.960
Would you help me, please?

20:01.920 --> 20:02.760
Gereon...

20:04.360 --> 20:05.760
He's no longer between us.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.280
Moritz.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.680
AIRFIELD BERLIN-STAAKEN

22:41.640 --> 22:42.640
Councillor.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.240
The most modern thing in the air today.

22:47.760 --> 22:51.040
The initial model.
You're lucky it's in Berlin right now.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.200
It was supposed to do a test flight
from Hamburg to Lisbon.

22:54.280 --> 22:57.040
-What happened?
-A crash landing.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.840
Well, an emergency landing.
New things want to be tested.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.160
You know the deal?

23:12.360 --> 23:13.280
-No.
-No.

23:13.680 --> 23:14.880
Never opened a parachute before?

23:15.320 --> 23:16.880
It's the first flight for these men.

23:18.280 --> 23:20.600
The chief of police said
they would be professionals.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.800
Professional police officers.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.440
-Never flown before?
-No.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.360
No.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.120
Gentlemen, your pilot.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.040
Siegfried Stoltz. A battle-tested man,
experienced with long distances.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.760
And his navigator, Robert Sauer.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.600
-Rath.
-Sauer.

23:48.680 --> 23:49.520
-Stoltz.
-Gräf.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.360
-Hello.
-Gräf.

23:51.920 --> 23:52.760
Hello.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.440
-You've been briefed?
-We have the coordinates.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.720
If they are correct.
It's a long haul, with no stop.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.680
But you can do it?

24:03.280 --> 24:04.200
We'll manage.

24:06.120 --> 24:06.960
Soldiers.

24:14.040 --> 24:14.920
Good luck.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.560
Make yourselves comfortable.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.360
It's a cargo plane.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.400
-You can't put in seats overnight.
-Please.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.320
Did you see the hatch back there?

24:59.440 --> 25:01.600
It'll be a top-notch bomber
when we get to do it again.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.800
-Really?
-Just a little tinkering

25:03.880 --> 25:05.000
and we're ready for the drop.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.680
And which plane
has this much room for refills?

25:08.400 --> 25:09.240
Right.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.840
Put them between your legs.
And aim down the sconce.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.640
-Open the fuel cock.
-Yes, sir.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.560
Mixture set.

26:22.680 --> 26:23.760
Damn it!

26:33.400 --> 26:34.280
Damn!

26:34.360 --> 26:35.320
Piece of junk.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.680
The control stick gets stuck sometimes.
So don't be surprised, it happens.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.840
REICH MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
MITTE, BERLIN

28:14.920 --> 28:18.560
Minister Stresemann,
we have reliable information

28:18.640 --> 28:21.720
that certain circles
are planning to assassinate you.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.240
-Very soon.
-Communists?

28:25.080 --> 28:26.320
National forces.

28:30.480 --> 28:34.480
How many assassinations on me have you
and your men prevented in recent years?

28:35.560 --> 28:37.560
Ten? Twenty?

28:38.960 --> 28:40.600
Twelve, to be precise.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.120
Then do what you always do.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.840
Your men save my life,

28:46.680 --> 28:48.080
I save the peace,

28:48.160 --> 28:52.040
and one day we will die,
very snugly in our bathtub.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.800
The state visit right now... Foreign minister Briand?

28:59.080 --> 29:02.200
We have evidence of a stark change
in the security situation.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.520
A changed situation doesn't faze me,
Benda.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.240
I just don't love my life enough for that.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.720
But what worries me
is what you brought me here.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.320
I wasn't sure you were aware of it.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.920
The entire Reichstag knows about Lipetsk.
But these dimensions...

29:22.120 --> 29:26.080
This finally contains enough evidence
to take half the general staff to court.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.960
For goodness sake, please don't.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.440
You mean the Reichstag
is happy about the fact

29:31.520 --> 29:35.000
that the Russians are helping us
to build a modern air force?

29:37.240 --> 29:38.080
Aren't you?

29:44.440 --> 29:49.600
Minister, I know you've always seen
the Treaty of Versailles

29:49.680 --> 29:51.680
as a defamation of Germany.

29:52.720 --> 29:57.400
But you weren't awarded the Nobel prize
for this stance, but for a peace treaty.

29:57.480 --> 29:59.120
The aim of my peace mediation is solely
to make sure

29:59.200 --> 30:02.600
new agreements are no longer
based on the moral humiliation

30:02.680 --> 30:04.640
and economic subjugation
of our Fatherland.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.920
It disturbs me
that you're so sure about this.

30:11.880 --> 30:15.000
Things are complex in the German Reich,
always have been.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.600
I don't doubt that.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.640
But what will you say
when the League of Nations hears

30:19.720 --> 30:24.240
that Lipetsk is not a small training camp
for a handful of hotspurs

30:24.320 --> 30:27.080
but that a new German Air Force
is being built there?

30:32.280 --> 30:34.360
Please excuse me once again.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.960
If my Käte were to come in now,
then heaven help me.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.080
Carry on, Benda.

30:47.120 --> 30:50.200
I keep far fewer secrets from Dr. Koller
than from my wife.

30:51.480 --> 30:56.160
We have confiscated a freight train
with a quantity of poison gas

30:56.640 --> 30:59.360
which would be enough for manufacturing
at least 100,000 grenades.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.480
New estimates regarding the troop strength

31:02.560 --> 31:04.480
of the shadow army of the Reichswehr

31:04.920 --> 31:06.640
are in the range of six figures.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.440
And now, of all time,
when the French are our guests.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.800
If the French foreign minister
hears of such dimensions,

31:15.880 --> 31:17.640
I'd look like a fraud.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.360
I'll say goodbye for now.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.760
-Thank you, Patachon.
-Watch out, Pat.

31:22.840 --> 31:23.680
Aye-aye, sir.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.000
What do you suggest?

31:38.240 --> 31:41.440
It's only a matter of time
until this affair will create waves.

31:41.520 --> 31:45.760
And then you should not look like a fraud,
but like a spotter.

31:50.880 --> 31:51.920
Continue.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.720
I'm about to obtain updated evidence
in Russia.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.480
And then we take that gang to court,
in Germany.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.520
Whom do you mean exactly?

32:04.560 --> 32:05.720
Seegers, Ludendorff...

32:06.600 --> 32:07.560
Just the top men.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.920
Apparently you love your life even less
than I love mine.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.360
<i>A leyb hot nit moyre far keyn flig.</i>

32:16.480 --> 32:19.440
A lion doesn't fear a fly. I know, Benda.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.840
My wife keeps saying that, too.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.440
<i>Gereon.</i>

33:01.760 --> 33:05.720
<i>Now they're trying to convince us</i>
<i>that all men are equal.</i>

33:08.080 --> 33:10.760
Another big misconception
of the modern era.

33:11.880 --> 33:13.480
Man is flawed.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.080
The masses are a danger.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.440
Capital is full of temptation.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.840
We are all sinners.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.720
We're only equal in that respect.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.080
Physically and mentally,

33:30.160 --> 33:31.440
we're unequal.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.480
That is God-given.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.600
Take your brother, Anno.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.960
Never make the mistake to strive
for the same aims as him.

33:43.120 --> 33:49.080
Men differ the most clearly
in their aptitude for leadership.

33:52.400 --> 33:55.800
If you are not humble enough
to recognize this,

33:56.440 --> 33:58.760
you should not lay any claims
to power at all.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.840
In the state, we find

34:02.920 --> 34:04.880
<i>our true nature of man.</i> <i>A divine world order</i>

34:07.880 --> 34:10.440
will only be reflected in that society

34:11.040 --> 34:13.640
which allows for a structured state.

34:15.640 --> 34:16.880
<i>The hierarchy...</i>

34:18.800 --> 34:22.360
<i>is embedded in the divine origin</i>
<i>of the state...</i>

34:35.480 --> 34:36.960
Why did you leave me?

34:39.560 --> 34:40.400
Helga. Why?

34:44.440 --> 34:45.480
Tell me.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.560
Why did you leave me?

34:52.520 --> 34:53.480
Say it.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.440
Why?

35:01.120 --> 35:02.760
I've fallen in love with your brother.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.400
And now?

35:09.400 --> 35:10.600
You have to make up your mind.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.240
I have made up my mind.

35:27.800 --> 35:28.640
Helga!

35:31.800 --> 35:32.760
<i>Helga!</i>

35:50.760 --> 35:51.760
<i>God has left us.</i>

35:53.240 --> 35:54.360
<i>A long time ago.</i>

35:56.360 --> 35:57.440
<i>And what remains?</i>

35:59.880 --> 36:00.920
A hull.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.280
A tree without roots.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.640
A world without light.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.120
First, the wrong son returns home...

36:14.800 --> 36:16.600
then you leave me alone with him.

36:33.560 --> 36:34.400
Father.

36:57.720 --> 36:59.400
That's just what we needed today.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.640
We're very close to the coordinates.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.080
But the bad weather
is making it difficult.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.960
-What?
-The navigating. We'll go lower.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.040
Under the clouds.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.440
What happened? We got hit.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.480
Ignite.

38:10.560 --> 38:11.520
Not happening.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.680
Do it again.

38:17.680 --> 38:18.600
Again, nothing.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.920
Go steeper. The propellers are jammed.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.200
OK, ignite.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.760
Ignite.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.800
There, right in front of us.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.120
Our target.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.600
Yes, this must be it.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.840
But shouldn't we keep our distance?

39:09.640 --> 39:12.640
Yes, sure.
But don't you want to take photos?

39:13.040 --> 39:14.520
Now, man. Visibility is good.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.560
We won't be getting any closer.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.160
Come on now.

39:28.480 --> 39:30.520
You lie down
and your mate will hold on to you.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.040
Don't forget to hold on.

39:45.440 --> 39:46.640
Go on, then.

40:05.680 --> 40:06.560
Go on, don't be afraid.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.600
Pull me back in!

40:34.880 --> 40:36.440
I have to change the film.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.560
Your hand!

41:00.880 --> 41:01.720
Go on!

41:31.800 --> 41:33.960
As long as the clouds are dense,
we're safe.

41:45.320 --> 41:47.120
I'll change our course temporarily.

41:47.720 --> 41:49.000
Just to be safe.

42:00.280 --> 42:02.400
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

42:03.720 --> 42:05.600
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

42:07.440 --> 42:09.240
<i>But not yet now</i>

42:11.640 --> 42:14.680
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

42:22.080 --> 42:25.040
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

42:25.720 --> 42:28.120
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

42:29.200 --> 42:32.160
<i>But not yet now</i>

42:32.920 --> 42:35.640
<i>Miracles wait</i>

42:36.640 --> 42:39.080
<i>But not yet now</i>

42:40.640 --> 42:43.880
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

42:55.880 --> 42:58.880
<i>It must be just a dream</i>

42:59.480 --> 43:03.920
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

43:04.160 --> 43:07.800
<i>Who really knows?</i>

43:10.520 --> 43:13.640
<i>The clock on your wall</i>

43:14.160 --> 43:17.400
<i>It is filled with sand</i>

43:17.800 --> 43:21.000
<i>Put your hand in mine</i>

43:21.640 --> 43:25.080
<i>And let us be forever</i>

43:25.160 --> 43:28.400
<i>Now you make your choice</i>

43:28.480 --> 43:33.440
<i>And throw us</i>
<i>in between happiness and agony</i>

43:33.520 --> 43:37.120
<i>But I can forgive you</i>

43:39.720 --> 43:42.920
<i>You are very close to death</i>

43:43.520 --> 43:46.240
<i>But your eye still clear</i>

43:46.320 --> 43:49.800
<i>Does it recognize me? I'm ready</i>

43:49.880 --> 43:54.520
<i>To seek immortality with you</i>
