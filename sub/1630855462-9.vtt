18:09.456 --> 18:11.558
-I get burned.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.360
you really liked us.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.361

18:14.394 --> 18:16.096
Deeply and desperately.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.732
And all I wanted
was for you to like me.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.435
Instead, you treated me like...

18:21.468 --> 18:23.337

18:23.370 --> 18:28.609

close female friends anymore.

and just pretend not to listen.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.449
I can do that.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.617

around at this late stage.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.764
that this might be
all of my fault.

that I have been cursed with.

to help you.

-So that you would, I don't
know, see me as a friend,

19:15.856 --> 19:17.825
treat me as a friend.

19:17.858 --> 19:20.094
I did say thank you
for your help with the hex.

19:20.127 --> 19:21.629
-Not once.
-I meant to?

19:21.662 --> 19:24.331
-You didn't.
-Thank you so much.

one last chance to show me

any kindness.

of waiting to become

into his own hands.
