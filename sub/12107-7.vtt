19:13.519 --> 19:15.721
You girls better start
pooling your money,

19:15.787 --> 19:17.322
because I'm about to win
this thing.

19:17.389 --> 19:21.326
- Then perhaps it's time
to turn up the heat.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.699
- Phew. Is it hot in here?

19:27.766 --> 19:29.768
98 degrees?

19:29.835 --> 19:32.604
So that's how
she's gonna play it.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.439
{\an1}- Lincoln,
what are you doing?

19:34.506 --> 19:35.941
- Just reading.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.677
{\an3}Oh, and I polished every
surface in the living room.

19:38.744 --> 19:41.046
{\an3}So shiny
you can see your face.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.147
- Aah!

19:42.214 --> 19:45.350
Must...not...look...
at...self!

19:45.417 --> 19:48.186
Beautiful, beautiful self!

19:48.253 --> 19:49.922
{\an3}Aah!

19:49.988 --> 19:52.391
{\an1}- And I waxed
the kitchen floor, too!

Such reflection!

Give up, Lincoln!
You know you want these.

20:00.098 --> 20:02.801
{\an3}Smell 'em!
Smell that cotton!

20:02.868 --> 20:04.836
You know you want 'em!

20:04.903 --> 20:06.338
- I'm not giving up!

20:06.405 --> 20:07.639
You'd give up right now

20:07.706 --> 20:09.274
{\an1}if you could see what's wrong
with your face!

20:09.341 --> 20:10.542
{\an3}- What?

20:10.609 --> 20:12.911
{\an3}Guys, is there something
wrong with my face?

20:12.978 --> 20:14.880
- You look beautiful.
- You look gorgeous.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.783
{\an3}- Lies!
Give me a mirror!

20:17.849 --> 20:19.985

Lily!

have to give up reading comics

Why should Lincoln have to
give up his?

We should all accept

Even if some of them are
