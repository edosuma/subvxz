WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:02.959
I found this at Blake's office.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.999
That's the phone he's been
using to call his contacts.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.959
- Will they take 30?
- I could ask.

00:06.960 --> 00:09.319
Assuming you can do as
you say, you'll give me half.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.639
- Was this the hospital?
- Yeah.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.959
Is it Walkerstein?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.319
I don't have a
gambling problem, OK?

00:14.320 --> 00:16.959
Have you got an answer?
I'll be in touch.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.959
We could invest this as soon as possible.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.319
I could help you find a van.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.959
- There's five grand there. You happy now?
- You still owe me 12.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.959
Dave's stopped paying
the rent on the house.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
Tell me what you know,
or you'll be out.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.960 --> 00:38.960
Hi - Looking lovely as ever.

00:41.960 --> 00:42.960
Thank you.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.959
Well, I never refuse a dinner invite,

00:44.960 --> 00:48.639
although I imagine you have
something else up your sleeve.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.959
Maybe.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.959
Let's eat first, we'll
discuss business later.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.960
OK.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.959
You really came through for me
with that Walkerstein information.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.959
I'm sorry I couldn't pay your
contact what they were asking,

01:34.960 --> 01:37.479
but without knowing who they
were, it was too much of a gamble.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.959
Well, I'm glad you made a good

01:39.960 --> 01:41.159
return on your investment.

01:41.160 --> 01:43.999
With Blake off-limits, I've had
to use a less experienced broker.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.959
Possibly an OK return on my money,
but that's all it's gonna be - OK.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.960
And for the risk I'm taking,
"OK" isn't why I do this.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.479
My er, my law firm is currently handling

02:01.480 --> 02:03.959
the fallout from a
drugs trial gone wrong.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.999
Bauervite, the pharmaceutical company,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.479
have got a report out next week

02:08.479 --> 02:10.959
that is going to destroy
their current share price.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.959
I need someone I can trust.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.959
Who can trade under other identities

02:15.960 --> 02:17.959
and short it without drawing
the attention of the FCA.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.959
Er, you want to go short on it?

02:20.960 --> 02:22.959
Well, yeah.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.959
If I bet against them now, I can
make a fortune when the shares drop.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.960
This is how Blake and I
usually handle things.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.959
I think Blake would have
used two clean accounts

02:33.960 --> 02:36.960
to avoid suspicion on a
50 grand investment.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.040
I assume you've got a system
in place to do the same?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.960
I... 50 grand?

02:46.960 --> 02:47.960
A system? Of course I do.

02:47.961 --> 02:50.959
The announcement
won't be till next week,

02:50.960 --> 02:52.959
so you've got plenty of
time to sort things out.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.319
I should double my
money, so I'll pay you 10%.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.959
10,000 at least, I'd imagine.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.960
10,000. What do you say?

03:03.480 --> 03:05.639
Can you handle it?

03:05.640 --> 03:08.639
Of course.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.960
Of course I can handle it.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.959
Hi there.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.959
Erm, I need to put erm, quite
a lot of cash into my erm,

03:40.960 --> 03:42.959
my daughter's accounts.

03:42.960 --> 03:45.959
So, my dad, he passed
away a few weeks ago

03:45.960 --> 03:49.959
and he had this vintage E-type
just rusting away in a garage.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.959
Well, an old friend of mine, he
offered me 50,000 cash for it.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.959
Nearly fell over when he asked.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.959
Yes, so 25,000 of that into
each of my daughters' accounts.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.959
How long will that take to clear?

04:00.960 --> 04:03.479
With such a large amount we
need to do some internal checks,

04:03.480 --> 04:05.960
but it should be on the
system immediately.Great.

04:20.959 --> 04:21.959
What the hell are
you doing here, Blake?

04:21.961 --> 04:23.959
You can't be seen anywhere near here.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.959
I've been trying to
contact you for weeks.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.959
I've left messages to call me
back. I'm not gonna do that.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.959
We're not supposed to
be talking to each other.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.959
I need my burner phone.
I left it in the office.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.960
What?! It all happened so quickly.

04:38.960 --> 04:39.960
OK. Where is it?

05:03.960 --> 05:07.959
So, I sold my Walkerstein shares
earlier and I made 7,000.What?

05:07.960 --> 05:09.959
What about you? You sold yours?

05:09.960 --> 05:11.959
No. I didn't invest mine in the end.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
I had some bills I needed to pay off.

05:12.961 --> 05:14.319
Right.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.959
I thought you were gonna
invest it? No, not this time.

05:16.960 --> 05:18.159
This will be me for now, I reckon.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.999
It's great that it's worked so far,
but I don't want to push my luck.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.639
I only just managed to talk
Mum around on the whole

05:23.640 --> 05:25.959
'coffee in a van' thing, so
it'd be a bit of a downer

05:25.960 --> 05:28.959
if I suddenly got arrested
for insider trading.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.959
We went and saw my
brother again the other day.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.959
He's doing better, so
that's made her happy.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.960
Babe.

05:33.961 --> 05:35.959
Babe!

05:35.960 --> 05:37.960
Who's that?

05:39.960 --> 05:42.959
Er, nobody. You ain't
met someone, have you?

05:42.960 --> 05:43.960
No, of course I haven't.

05:43.961 --> 05:47.960
I've just remembered
it's my turn to clean the loos.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.959
Where's the phone? What phone?

06:02.960 --> 06:03.999
I'm not playing games any more.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.960
I know you took it from his office.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.959
I don't know what you
mean. Blake's phone.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.800
I want it back, now.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.959
Right, you know, now you
mention it, yeah, I did find a phone.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.959
In fact, it had your name all over it.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.959
I think I'll keep hold of it for now?

06:24.960 --> 06:26.959
You have no idea the trouble
you are making for yourself.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.319
Really? And where's my 15,000?

06:29.320 --> 06:31.959
We had an agreement. Yeah,
yeah, you're right, we did.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.959
But erm, unfortunately
I don't have the money.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.159
I mean, I did, but... well, I spent
it. Well, that was a mistake.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.960
There's not much you can do about it.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.959
Hey.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.960
Come with me.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.320
A phone has gone missing.

07:08.800 --> 07:09.959
A phone that is vital evidence in a case

07:09.960 --> 07:11.959
that I've been building
for the past two years.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.959
Do you know anything
about that? Nothing.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
Really? Cos you seem unsure.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.319
Look, if you've been lying

07:19.320 --> 07:22.959
and I find out that you and that
other cleaner have got the phone,

07:22.960 --> 07:24.959
then you both could
be in a lot of trouble.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.640
I don't know anything. I think you do.

07:26.960 --> 07:27.999
Which means you're
currently obstructing

07:28.000 --> 07:30.959
a criminal investigation. Do
you realise how serious that is?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
You're looking at four
or five years in prison.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.959
Right, I'll call the police. No, don't.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.959
Tell me where the phone
is and I won't have to.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.959
I don't know where it is.

07:41.960 --> 07:42.960
Fine.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.959
OK, stop!

07:51.960 --> 07:54.959
We found the phone in the office,
but we didn't know it was important.

07:54.960 --> 07:56.959
Well, now you do and I need it back.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.159
OK. I'll talk to Sam.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.479
No, no. You can't talk to your friend.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.959
This is a highly
confidential investigation.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.959
If you breathe a word of this to anyone,

08:05.960 --> 08:07.959
you will be compromising years of work.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
Do you understand?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.799
Hey, babe. Where you been?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.959
I was just taking some bins
out. Is everything all right?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.080
Yeah, everything's fine.
Right. I'll see you in a bit.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.318
Hello? Hey.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.958
I know we said we should
do dinner again soon.

08:39.960 --> 08:40.999
How's tomorrow night sound?

08:41.000 --> 08:44.959
Tomorrow night? Yeah, er, I
think I could make that work.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.799
Where were you thinking? 'My place.'

08:46.800 --> 08:47.959
Your place?

08:47.960 --> 08:50.479
'Yeah, I love to cook. It'll be fun.'

08:50.480 --> 08:53.799
That sounds great. I'll
text you the address.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.959
How does seven thirty sound?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.960
I'll see you there.

09:38.960 --> 09:42.319
Can I help you? Yeah, I hope so.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.959
Erm, I'm looking for
like a statement piece.

09:44.960 --> 09:49.319
Something smart and
sophisticated, but with a hint of sass.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.960
"Sass"? Yeah, you know,
like a certain sassy.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.959
What about something like this?

09:56.960 --> 09:59.319
I mean, this is exactly the
type of thing I was looking for.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.959
Yeah?

10:00.960 --> 10:03.960
Right, that particular dress costs Â£700.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.959
Erm, we do have some
cheaper items in the back

10:06.960 --> 10:08.960
that might be more in your price range.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.959
No, Â£700 is absolutely fine, actually.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.959
In fact, I'll still have
money left over for a bag.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.160
And maybe a coat, too.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.960
You've got to be quicker than that!

10:58.960 --> 11:00.959
I wanna do A-levels cos
I wanna go to university.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.959
I just don't know why you'd want to
lumber yourself with all that debt.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.959
You'll spend years paying it off

11:05.960 --> 11:07.959
and it won't be nice having
that hanging round your neck.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.959
If you work hard, you'll get to the
top in whatever you want to do.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.959
When I was your age...
God, here we go.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.959
When he were a lad, he used
to sleep in rolled-up newspaper,

11:16.960 --> 11:18.799
with a lump of stale bread for breakfast.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.959
Stale bread?

11:19.960 --> 11:21.959
Yeah, and that were
only on special occasions.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.959
Anyway, I might like
to be a sports therapist.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.639
I could always take a year
out and, you know, save up.

11:28.640 --> 11:29.959
How much have I got in my savings?

11:29.960 --> 11:32.959
A few hundred, I think.
Don't know, I'll have to check.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.959
Anyway, I think it's great
Alice wants to go to uni.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.959
Whatever it costs, I'll be paying for it.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.959
You will? Yeah.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.159
Why shouldn't my girls have the
same opportunity as everyone else?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.959
We didn't.Exactly. And now
I'm cleaning toilets for a living.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.959
I won't be doing that for
much longer, I can assure you.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.639
It's taken me 20 years to realise it,

11:50.640 --> 11:51.959
but you can be anything
you want in this life.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.639
You just need to take
your chances. For starters,

11:54.640 --> 11:56.959
you wouldn't even be here if I
hadn't taken a chance on him.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.959
You took a chance on me, did you?
I think it was the other way round.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.959
Whatever. Chased after me,
couldn't get enough of me.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.319
Urgh, gross! OK, I don't
need to hear about that.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.000
I'll think about it.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.959
So, got the deposit back from the
landlady for this place yesterday.

12:15.960 --> 12:16.960
Good for you.

12:16.961 --> 12:18.959
I know you still think
you're gonna stay here,

12:18.960 --> 12:21.959
but dragging this out is only gonna
make things worse for the girls.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.999
I'm sorry, but I really
think we need to talk about

12:24.000 --> 12:25.959
when the girls can come
and move in with me.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.959
The girls are happy here. Why
should they move? You can't afford it.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.959
How would you know? Cos I
know how much debt you're in.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.959
Are you totally deluded?

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
And what was all that about,

12:35.961 --> 12:38.959
telling Ally you'll pay for
her to go to uni? I will.

12:38.960 --> 12:40.959
I don't even know what to say to that.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.959
Like, how? What planet
are you actually on?

12:43.960 --> 12:45.960
You just wait and see.

13:48.640 --> 13:53.960
Swanny, I'm really sorry
and I hate letting you down...

13:54.960 --> 13:56.799
but I can't do it.

13:56.800 --> 14:00.960
I have... er...

14:01.960 --> 14:04.959
a big deal I'm
working on at the minute

14:04.960 --> 14:08.960
and... I don't know what
the hell I'm doing, basically.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.480
'Welcome to Ladiesnight Casino.'

14:38.960 --> 14:42.960
Hi, Dad. Hello, Princess.
Where's your mum?

14:43.960 --> 14:45.159
Whoa, what's all this?

14:45.160 --> 14:47.959
I thought you were just going
out with some friends. I am.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.159
What kind of friends are they?

14:50.160 --> 14:53.960
You look some kind of
high-powered businesswoman like...

14:54.960 --> 14:57.959
Theresa May or summat.
Theresa bloody May?

14:57.960 --> 14:59.959
That's not quite the look I was going for.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.959
I mean, like, business, that sort of vibe.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.959
You look... you look good,
is what I'm trying to say.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.959
Thank you. Don't know
why it's such a surprise.

15:08.960 --> 15:12.960
I'd make a very good businesswoman,
thank you very much. Come here, you.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.959
Aw! Make sure she brushes her teeth.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.959
She's got a habit of saying she has
when she hasn't. Yes, I know, yeah.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.999
Lily's going to her
friend, Jadine's, house

15:22.000 --> 15:24.959
after school tomorrow. You'll
need to pick her up from there.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.959
Jadine? In't she the
one who...? No, no.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.959
They're friends now.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.960
Mwah!

15:34.800 --> 15:36.320
Well, I'd better go. See you later.

15:51.960 --> 15:52.960
Hi. Actually, look, I'm really sorry.

15:52.961 --> 15:54.960
Something's come up...

15:55.960 --> 15:57.959
Hey. Hi.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.959
You OK? Yeah, I'm fine.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.319
Come on in. Actually, I'm sorry.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.959
I probably should have said this before...

16:05.960 --> 16:10.959
You look lovely, by the
way. Thank you.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.960
Why don't you come in?

16:13.960 --> 16:15.960
OK.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.960
Can I er, take your coat? Thank you.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.160
There we are.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.959
I'm cooking a bouillebaise. You're
all right with seafood, yeah?

16:33.960 --> 16:36.639
Er, yeah. Yes, that's fine.

16:36.640 --> 16:37.959
I found this recipe online.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.959
I don't have a chinois, though, so er,

16:39.960 --> 16:43.959
you're gonna have to accept my
apologies if the sauce isn't smooth.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.960
Right, here we go.

16:47.320 --> 16:50.960
One for you... Cheers. Cheers.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.959
So erm, do you have
this place all to yourself?

16:55.960 --> 16:57.959
No kids? No. No kids.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.959
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that.
That... I didn't mean... No, no, no.

17:00.960 --> 17:04.959
That's OK. My ex-wife and I, we
were really very keen to have them,

17:04.960 --> 17:09.959
but erm... well, it just didn't work out.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.959
Right. You?

17:12.960 --> 17:16.959
Er, two boys. You're married?

17:16.960 --> 17:19.959
Well, technically I am,
but no, we're not together.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.959
It's sad, really.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.959
You think that's how it's gonna
be forever and then that's it.

17:23.960 --> 17:28.959
Yeah. So the er, the boys live with you?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.959
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. At
the moment they do,

17:31.960 --> 17:34.959
but erm, Dan wants them
to go live with him full-time.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.959
Thinks I can't look after them properly.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
Really? Why not?

17:39.960 --> 17:40.960
Well, unsociable hours, you know.

17:40.961 --> 17:42.960
Not being there in the evenings.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.799
He doesn't understand the sacrifices

17:45.800 --> 17:47.959
people like you and I have
to make for our careers.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.999
Exactly.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.959
Shit.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.959
The mussels haven't opened..

17:54.960 --> 17:57.960
Surely you can just press them
open with the knife and fork.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.960
I'm gonna have to chuck them.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.960
I'm gonna be completely
honest with you.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.960
I've never cooked a
bouillebaise in my life.

18:15.960 --> 18:19.959
Fish and chips? Good idea. I'm buying.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.960
Come on.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.959
Can't remember the last time
I ate chips out of a bag like this.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.520
That's how they're
supposed to be eaten.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.959
You see, this is what I
like about you, Nancy.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.959
No pretension.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.479
You know, you know
exactly who you are,

18:39.480 --> 18:40.959
and you don't care what anyone thinks.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.959
Well, that is very kind, but I
care as much as the next person.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.959
No, no, no. Your modesty
won't wash with me.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.799
In fact, I'm surprised you're
working as a sole trader,

18:50.800 --> 18:53.639
to be honest. Why's that?

18:53.640 --> 18:54.959
Someone with your capabilities

18:54.960 --> 18:57.960
should have had their own
brokerage firm by now, surely?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.959
Well, I have thought about
having my own company.

19:02.960 --> 19:06.959
I think I could clean up
with the right clientele.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.959
How's everything with the accounts?

19:08.960 --> 19:11.479
All in place for the Bauervite
announcement in a few days?

19:11.480 --> 19:14.959
Yeah. Everything's in place.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.000
Great.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.959
There you go.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.959
Lovely to see you.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.960
And you.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.800
Thank you.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.959
Banana and chocolate?

19:46.960 --> 19:48.959
You never had a banana and
chocolate sandwich before?

19:48.960 --> 19:50.799
They're the best.

19:50.800 --> 19:51.959
Mum, can I have
bananas and chocolate?

19:51.960 --> 19:53.959
I don't mind making
her one. Not a chance.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.959
But Glynn's gonna have one.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.959
I'm sure he is, but Willy Wonka
here also eats Pop Tarts for dinner.

19:58.960 --> 19:59.960
You need a healthy lunch.

19:59.961 --> 20:02.639
Yeah, bananas. They're
full of fibre and potassium.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.159
Good for the heart and
reduces blood pressure.

20:04.160 --> 20:06.000
I think Lily's blood pressure is fine.

20:07.960 --> 20:12.000
OK. Just for today,
though. Morning, darling.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.959
Mum, I was looking at when there's
another Gambler's Anonymous meeting.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.319
There's one tonight at six.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.959
I checked your rota and...

20:21.960 --> 20:24.960
Can you get the door, darling,
please? Please, you said.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.959
Hello, Barsha.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.959
Hiya, Liz. How are you?
I'm good, how are you?

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
Yeah, good thanks. Is your mum in?

20:33.961 --> 20:36.959
Hiya, Barsha. You didn't
say you were coming round.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.959
I should have warned you, but I
was seeing a tenant down the road,

20:38.960 --> 20:42.959
so thought I'd swing by.
Right, yeah. Is everything OK?

20:42.960 --> 20:45.959
I spoke to Dave a few days ago about
renewing your tenancy agreement.

20:45.960 --> 20:47.959
But he said you might
not be able to stay.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.959
No. No, no. He's moved out.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.959
I mean, we er, we seperated.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.959
Yes, well, of course it's
none of my business,

20:55.960 --> 20:58.639
but the original agreement
was in Dave's name

20:58.640 --> 21:01.959
so I need to draw up a new
contract and get a deposit from you.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.319
Deposit, yeah. How
much was that again?

21:04.320 --> 21:05.959
Â£1,500.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.959
Â£1,500. OK, right. Yeah.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.639
No problem.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.999
Great. I will need that ASAP,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.639
so can you have it ready
by the end of the week?

21:14.640 --> 21:15.959
Yeah.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.639
OK, I'll have the new tenancy
agreement drawn up then

21:18.640 --> 21:20.959
and er, yeah, I'd better be off.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.479
Great to see you.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.959
And you. Bye-bye. Take
care. Bye, Barsha.Thanks.

21:25.960 --> 21:29.319
You can't afford it, can you?

21:29.320 --> 21:31.159
Yeah, course I can.

21:31.160 --> 21:34.960
Come on, get to school. I
don't want you being late.

21:42.960 --> 21:46.159
OK, I give you time to think.
What have you decided?

21:46.160 --> 21:47.960
I don't know anything.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.959
Shaun from Compliance will call police

21:51.960 --> 21:53.319
unless you tell me what Sam did.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.959
Call police about what?

21:54.960 --> 21:57.959
We didn't do anything.
Why you protect Sam?

21:57.960 --> 22:01.960
OK, I have new job for you.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.999
A chef in the canteen
lost her engagement ring.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.160
She thinks it fall into bin.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.800
I need you to find it.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.959
Cool. You know my mum's a dancer?

22:28.960 --> 22:32.959
What, like in pop songs?
No, in musicals and stuff.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.319
Really? That's so cool.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.960
Do you want to play a game
or something? Yeah, OK.

23:02.960 --> 23:09.959
Four, five, six, seven, eight,

23:09.960 --> 23:15.960
nine, ten.
Ready or not, here I come.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.959
You all right, Sam?
Er, yeah, of course.

24:17.960 --> 24:19.959
Erm, I couldn't help but overhear

24:19.960 --> 24:22.959
your landlady asking
for a deposit earlier.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.319
Is everything OK? Yeah, yeah.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.800
Everything's fine.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.479
What are you up to anyway?

24:28.480 --> 24:31.959
Erm, road trip with Jess to see a van.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.959
What do you reckon,
Hobnobs or Jaffa Cakes?

24:34.960 --> 24:37.959
I was thinking Hobnobs so
we could dip them in our tea.

24:37.960 --> 24:38.960
Does Jess drink tea?

24:38.961 --> 24:40.959
Yeah, yeah. She drinks tea.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.960
Great. Maybe I'll take the Jaffa
Cakes anyway, just in case.

24:45.320 --> 24:49.959
Jesus! Where is this van, John O'Groats?

24:49.960 --> 24:52.959
It's just a little picnic. I don't
want Jess to get hungry.

24:52.960 --> 24:53.960
There's no danger of that.

24:53.961 --> 24:57.319
I think someone's got a little soft
spot for a certain someone else.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.960
What?

25:00.960 --> 25:01.960
No.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.960
It's exciting. Yeah.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.959
Are you all right? Er, yeah, sorry.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.959
I've just... got a problem
with a friend of mine.

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
Right.

25:16.961 --> 25:19.319
Erm... it's not Sam, is it?

25:19.320 --> 25:21.959
Why do you ask that?

25:21.960 --> 25:25.799
I just get the impression that
she's erm, having a few problems.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.959
Financially, I mean.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.959
I guess you probably know
her better than I do, so...

25:30.960 --> 25:33.800
Yeah, I guess so.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.319
So, er, this van that we're seeing today

25:39.320 --> 25:41.959
is actually one of the first models
that they made with soft springs

25:41.960 --> 25:45.959
which is exactly what you need
to do to erm, to take your weight.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.639
Thanks No.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.959
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

25:49.960 --> 25:52.959
I meant the weight of your
equipment, machines and stuff.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.959
Yeah, I know. I was just teasing you.

25:54.960 --> 25:58.960
Right. Have a crisp.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.959
Thanks for doing this.
I don't need to go, OK?

26:09.960 --> 26:12.320
And I'm doing this for you, remember?

26:13.480 --> 26:15.959
Darling. It's all men in there!

26:15.960 --> 26:17.159
What if there are no
women in this group?

26:17.160 --> 26:19.960
Well, let's just go in and see
what they have to say, OK?

26:24.960 --> 26:28.639
I see we have some new
faces with us this evening.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.959
Welcome.

26:29.960 --> 26:34.960
I'm Carl, and erm... well,
what can I call you?

26:38.160 --> 26:40.159
Hi, I'm Alice, and this is my mum.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.319
Great. Hello, Alice.

26:42.320 --> 26:46.960
And there is another name I can...?

26:47.960 --> 26:48.960
My name's Sam.

26:48.961 --> 26:51.959
Really glad you could
join us this evening, Sam.

26:51.960 --> 26:52.999
Now don't feel you have to,

26:53.000 --> 27:00.000
but sometimes talking about what
led us here today can help us relax.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.959
Yeah, but I don't really know
why I'm here just yet. Mum.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.959
What? I don't. No, no. That's OK.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.960
I remember my first time.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.800
I didn't know why I was here either.

27:14.960 --> 27:18.960
Which, I guess, that's what I
thought we could talk about today.

27:19.960 --> 27:22.959
Acceptance. That was
the hardest part for me.

27:22.960 --> 27:26.959
I was lying to myself
before that and I couldn't see

27:26.960 --> 27:32.959
the damage my lies were causing
to my friends and my family.

27:32.960 --> 27:37.640
But once I stopped lying, well,
that was the turning point.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.959
Warren. Really glad to see you again.

27:41.960 --> 27:47.000
It's been a while since...
Yeah, I've been busy.

27:49.160 --> 27:53.959
OK, who wants to talk about how
they came to accept who they were

27:53.960 --> 27:55.480
and stop lying to themselves?

28:00.960 --> 28:03.960
Hello? What watch?

28:05.960 --> 28:07.959
No, I can't imagine she's
done something like that.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.959
Hang on. Lily?

28:09.960 --> 28:12.959
When you were
playing at Jadine's house,

28:12.960 --> 28:14.799
you didn't pick up a
watch by accident, did you?

28:14.800 --> 28:16.639
No. You sure?

28:16.640 --> 28:17.959
Yeah.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.159
No, she's not got it.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.639
We were reading Alice In
Wonderland last time, weren't we?

28:24.640 --> 28:25.959
Do you remember where we got to?

28:25.960 --> 28:28.959
She was eating the mushrooms
to get big again when Alice...

28:28.960 --> 28:30.960
When Alice meets a caterpillar.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.960
We were just playing a game.

28:39.960 --> 28:40.960
I forgot I had it in my pocket.

28:40.961 --> 28:43.960
Why didn't you just say that earlier?

28:47.960 --> 28:51.960
We will have to give it back.
You understand that, right?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.960
I'm sorry. Just please
don't tell Mum or Dad.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.799
There's no point doing this if
you're not gonna take it seriously.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.959
I am taking it seriously. I
just don't need to be here.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.479
Who's that? Nobody.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.959
Come on, let's go.

29:13.960 --> 29:14.960
You leaving so soon?

29:14.961 --> 29:17.959
You haven't introduced
me to your daughter.

29:17.960 --> 29:18.960
Hello, Alice. I'm Warren.

29:18.961 --> 29:21.159
Hello. It's nice to finally meet ya.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.959
I think it's great what
you're doing, by the way.

29:23.960 --> 29:24.960
Just want to help out
your dear old mum.

29:24.961 --> 29:26.960
Come on, let's go.

29:28.960 --> 29:29.960
How do you know him?

29:29.961 --> 29:32.160
He's just an old friend.
Haven't seen him for a while.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.959
What a complete waste
of time. Come on.

29:40.960 --> 29:43.959
I just didn't see how it was
relevant to me, darling.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.959
How would you know?
You weren't even listening.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.959
What do you think about what that
guy said about deleting the apps?

29:48.960 --> 29:51.959
Sweetheart, this isn't something
you should be worried about.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.959
Yes, it is. My mum having
a gambling problem,

29:53.960 --> 29:56.959
of course I'm gonna be worried. I
don't have a gambling problem, OK?

29:56.960 --> 29:59.959
You should be thinking about
what A-levels you're gonna pick.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.959
Well, I can't afford to go to
university anyway. Dad's right.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.959
No point getting myself into
thousands of pounds of debt.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.959
Don't worry about the
money. I'll sort that.

30:06.960 --> 30:08.999
What are you talking
about? You can't afford it.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.959
Don't be so sure.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.959
Hi, Jake. Hey, what's he doing here?

30:14.960 --> 30:16.799
Picking me up. I'm going out.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.959
See ya. No, you're not!

30:17.960 --> 30:19.319
Not on that thing you're...

30:19.320 --> 30:20.960
Alice!

30:27.960 --> 30:29.959
I mean, I know people think
all students do is get drunk

30:29.960 --> 30:30.960
and watch Countdown

30:30.961 --> 30:32.999
but I just don't like the
thought of one of my girls

30:33.000 --> 30:35.319
wanting to go to uni and
not being able to, you know?

30:35.320 --> 30:38.960
Yeah, uni. Wouldn't mind
a free holiday myself.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.959
You know that phone
I found? Where is it?

30:44.960 --> 30:47.959
I've got it safe at home. Why?

30:47.960 --> 30:51.959
You know, I just... thought
it might be fun to read.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.959
Yeah, it's a right barrel of
laughs I couldn't put it down.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.959
What is it you want with it? I
thought you was done with all this.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.959
Yeah. No, I am, I just...
I thought it might be good

31:00.960 --> 31:02.959
if we were both clued up on things.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.960
I think I'll keep hold of it
for the time being, yeah?

31:06.960 --> 31:08.960
Yeah.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.959
Hey. Hey. What's happening?

31:27.960 --> 31:31.959
I gave Glynn the plans, the
design for the van the other day

31:31.960 --> 31:33.959
and he left them in his room.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.960
OK. Well, you know where it is.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.960
How's it all going?
Good, thanks. He's a star.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.959
I didn't see before she went to school,

31:44.960 --> 31:45.960
so maybe you could give it to her later.

31:45.961 --> 31:47.320
Yeah, of course.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.959
So Alice said you went to a
Gambler's Anonymous meeting

31:52.960 --> 31:56.479
last night. Well, I went for Alice.

31:56.480 --> 32:00.959
Yeah, but I think the fact that
you went is pretty incredible.

32:00.960 --> 32:03.959
And I'm proud of you for
doing something like that.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.960
I know it can't have been easy.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.959
Guess I never really
supported you properly, did I?

32:11.960 --> 32:15.960
It was always your problem, not ours.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.320
Is that how I made you feel?

32:25.960 --> 32:28.959
Well, maybe I could have done more.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.960
If I had, things would
have turned out different.

32:33.960 --> 32:39.480
And now... you seem to
have turned a corner.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.959
Anyway, I'd better go.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.960
I'll see you later.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.959
What are you doing? Er...

33:12.960 --> 33:14.960
I was... I was just...

33:16.800 --> 33:18.959
I just wondered if I could borrow it.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.959
Jess, what are you really
doing with that phone?

33:20.960 --> 33:22.960
Shit. OK.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.959
You know Frances from Compliance?

33:25.960 --> 33:29.319
Well, this phone is really important
evidence in a case she's building.

33:29.320 --> 33:31.959
She knows we've got
it, but if we give it back

33:31.960 --> 33:33.159
we won't get into trouble.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.959
We can't give her this phone.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.999
Why not? Jess, please don't freak out

33:39.000 --> 33:43.479
but Frances was at that meeting
with Graham and Swanny.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.959
What? She's working with
them. She helps them out.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.959
Makes sure the FCA never
find out what they're up to.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.080
And she wants this phone
because it's a threat to her.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.959
So you lied to me. Well, yeah, I did...

33:56.960 --> 33:58.960
Jess, wait a minute! What...

34:00.960 --> 34:04.639
For God's sake, Jess! OK, I did
lie, but I did it to protect you.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.959
You did it to protect yourself, more like.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.958
You knew I would have
put a stop to all this.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.319
You're just selfish. You don't
care what anyone else thinks.

34:11.320 --> 34:13.958
What? You'll say anything
to get what you want.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.958
I didn't hear you complaining
when I handed over your money.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.958
I didn't ask for any of this
shit. This was all your idea.

34:18.960 --> 34:19.960
You didn't take much persuading.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.319
Well, I did it for a reason.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.958
But you, you just seem
to love being a criminal.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.958
I can see you getting all excited by it.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.958
I didn't realise you were so
appalled by the whole thing.

34:28.960 --> 34:29.960
If it's all so terrible,

34:29.960 --> 34:31.958
you won't want any of the filthy
money we've made so far?

34:31.960 --> 34:33.958
That van you've got, you
should probably take it back.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.958
No, I didn't think so.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.958
Look, you are just as
involved in all this as I am.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.958
You like to pretend you're
all sweet and innocent.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.958
Yeah, I should have
told you about Frances.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.958
I didn't cos you're my
friend, I knew you'd panic

34:44.960 --> 34:46.958
but I am not gonna
apologise for what we're doing.

34:46.960 --> 34:50.319
And neither should you. Those
bankers sure as hell don't.

34:50.320 --> 34:53.958
Did anyone come out and say sorry
when the whole economy went tits up?

34:53.960 --> 34:55.958
No. We are where we are
because they put us there.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.959
It's one rule for them and
another rule for everyone else.

34:58.960 --> 34:59.960
Well, not any more.

34:59.961 --> 35:02.959
You're damn right, I am selfish
when it comes to me and my girls.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.959
And that's how it's
gonna be from now on.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.959
So you can call it quits or
say it's wrong and immoral,

35:07.960 --> 35:10.959
but the real reason is you're too
scared to stand up for yourself

35:10.960 --> 35:12.960
and start fighting back.

35:32.960 --> 35:36.799
Hello. How's it going? 'Yeah, OK.'

35:36.800 --> 35:38.959
Listen, about the report.
There's been a change of plan.

35:38.960 --> 35:41.959
They're gonna make the announcement
about Bauervite tomorrow.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.799
What? 'Yeah. Hope that's OK.'

35:43.800 --> 35:46.959
Er... yeah, no. Of course.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.479
That's absolutely fine.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.960
'Great. Talk to you soon.' Bye.

36:12.960 --> 36:16.960
Viktor, I just checked work rota and
you gave me six hours next week.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.999
Next week, six. Week
after, could be less.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.960
No, I need more hours.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.959
I understand why you're
trying to help them,

36:25.960 --> 36:29.959
but I'm not going to get
Sam in trouble with police.

36:29.960 --> 36:32.959
It is your pass that opened
the research department door

36:32.960 --> 36:34.959
and it is you running away on CCTV.

36:34.960 --> 36:38.959
If you don't say what Sam did,
you are the one who will be fired

36:38.960 --> 36:40.960
and you are the one
who will go to prison.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.959
I'm not taking the heat for this.

36:44.960 --> 36:45.960
Wait.

36:45.961 --> 36:48.959
I'm gonna give you Â£500 to cover for us.

36:48.960 --> 36:50.959
Â£500? Yes.

36:50.960 --> 36:54.959
OK. But I want to know the truth.

36:54.960 --> 36:55.960
And then we talk to Sam.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.960
But first you have to promise
you will keep us out of trouble.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.959
Nina. Why don't you tell
Sam what you just told me?

37:08.960 --> 37:14.959
Er... Sam paid me to set off the fire alarm

37:14.960 --> 37:17.959
and then she went and
printed out some documents.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.159
What are you saying? He made me.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.959
But I made a deal with him,
so he hasn't told Compliance.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.959
As long as you leave right now. What?

37:24.960 --> 37:27.959
That's not what we agreed!
That's not what he said, Sam!

37:27.960 --> 37:29.959
I agreed not to talk to Compliance.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.959
But she must go.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.959
I want your pass and I want
you gone, immediately!

37:34.960 --> 37:36.959
I'm fired?

37:36.960 --> 37:38.959
Yes. Fired from what?

37:38.960 --> 37:40.959
The zero hours contract
you've got us on?

37:40.960 --> 37:42.960
Not sure that's even a thing, Viktor.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.160
I'm sorry, Sam. I tried.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.959
Listen, come here. Don't worry, OK?

38:08.960 --> 38:11.960
I get it. You two go back up.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.960
I'll speak to you
tomorrow. See you, girls.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.959
Have you got it? Your time's up.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.959
No. And we're not gonna get it, either.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.959
I know what's going on.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.960
And I'm not scared of you.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.959
Hey, Sam. You're back early.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.640
Kids are upstairs asleep, I think.

39:04.480 --> 39:05.959
Bad day at the office?

39:05.960 --> 39:09.960
I got fired from the office.
What did they fire you for?

39:10.960 --> 39:12.959
Nothing. I was just doing
my job and they fired me.

39:12.960 --> 39:15.959
Fired for nothing.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.160
I'm sure you could challenge
that as unfair dismissal.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.959
Do you know anyone who's
set up their own company?

39:23.960 --> 39:26.479
Erm, no. Don't think so.

39:26.480 --> 39:29.960
It's a good idea, though. A
cleaning company, you mean?

39:32.960 --> 39:35.959
Look, I know I asked
you about this already,

39:35.960 --> 39:39.479
but I was thinking that I could
possibly lend you that deposit.

39:39.480 --> 39:43.959
Well, erm, just in case you don't
have the cash right now, here it is.

39:43.960 --> 39:46.000
Glynn...

39:48.960 --> 39:50.959
I really like staying here
with you and the girls,

39:50.960 --> 39:54.479
and it just would be such
a shame if I had to leave.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.959
Thank you.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.639
Look, I'm owed some money so
I'll pay you back as soon as I can,

39:58.640 --> 40:00.960
I promise.

40:08.960 --> 40:11.640
I'll give this to Barsha tomorrow.

40:15.640 --> 40:16.959
Hi, Mum.

40:16.960 --> 40:17.960
Why aren't you at work?

40:17.961 --> 40:20.639
I've taken some holidays,
so I've got a few days off.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.479
Does that mean we can do something
fun after school? Yeah, maybe.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.959
I need to talk to you
about something first.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.960
What?

40:31.960 --> 40:34.319
Your dad said you took
this from Jadine's house,

40:34.320 --> 40:36.640
that you were playing
a game. Is that true?

40:37.960 --> 40:40.480
Yeah. Is it really?

40:41.960 --> 40:44.959
Come on. You won't get in
trouble if you just tell me the truth.

40:44.960 --> 40:48.000
I don't want to move
out of this house, Mum.

40:49.960 --> 40:52.960
I thought that if I sold the watch,
then I'd give you the money.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.960
I'm sorry.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.960
It's OK, darling.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.959
'Someone's obviously
taken the burner phone,

41:53.960 --> 41:55.319
so we need to tell Swanny.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.959
His tipoffs are all over it.'

41:56.960 --> 41:58.959
No, I think we should keep
this between ourselves.

41:58.960 --> 41:59.960
I'm sure it'll show up.

41:59.961 --> 42:02.319
'We can't take that chance.
Someone might be onto us.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.960
We're all at risk here.'
Fine. I'll be in touch.

42:29.960 --> 42:33.159
Yeah, Dave? 'I've just checked
the girls' savings account.'

42:33.160 --> 42:35.799
Where the hell's all
this money come from?

42:35.800 --> 42:36.959
There's over 25,000 in each.

42:36.960 --> 42:40.959
'What have you done, Sam?' Um, er...

42:40.960 --> 42:41.960
Well, I won it.

42:41.961 --> 42:43.959
I won it gambling.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.960
You told me you'd stopped gambling.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.959
Dave, just don't touch that money, OK?

42:48.960 --> 42:50.959
I need you to leave that
exactly where it is, please.

42:50.960 --> 42:51.960
'Too late.

42:51.961 --> 42:54.959
I've took it.' No...

42:54.960 --> 42:56.959
And I'm gonna do what you
should have done already,

42:56.960 --> 42:58.960
and clear off the debt
you got us in.Dave...

43:01.160 --> 43:03.960
Shit!

44:15.960 --> 44:18.960
Place your bets.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.960
Final bets.

44:38.960 --> 44:40.959
On nine, please. Nine.

44:40.960 --> 44:42.160
No more bets. Thank you.
