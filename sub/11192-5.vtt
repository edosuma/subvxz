WEBVTT

00:12.800 --> 00:14.875
Come on, Frakes! Let's go!

00:18.559 --> 00:21.975
Connor! Connor! I lost the remote.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.966
Got it!

01:01.679 --> 01:03.755
Frakes!

01:04.397 --> 01:05.679
Frakes!

01:06.198 --> 01:08.522
Go.

01:08.518 --> 01:10.593
Go!

01:30.638 --> 01:33.758
Frakes, Frakes, Frakes...

01:35.116 --> 01:37.822
I'm disappointed in you, my son.

02:01.716 --> 02:04.290
So, Connor got through.

02:04.356 --> 02:07.939
- What about this one?
- Burn him.

03:35.474 --> 03:37.882
For a planet with
a UV radiation as high as this,

03:37.873 --> 03:40.115
the plant life seems to be doing very well.

03:40.115 --> 03:43.484
Abydos was the exception,
as far as trees are concerned.

03:43.435 --> 03:49.853
That makes sense. To support human life,
there must be carbon-based vegetation.

03:49.674 --> 03:54.336
It is no accident. Many worlds were
terraformed by the Goa'ulds long ago.

03:54.873 --> 03:59.620
OK, let's take a quick look around
the gate before we move out to find SG-9.

03:59.913 --> 04:02.322
- They can't be that far.
- I don't know.

04:02.313 --> 04:07.687
This is the middle of nowhere. I doubt it
plays an active role in anybody's culture.

04:15.313 --> 04:17.473
Is there a problem, Dr. Carter?

04:17.473 --> 04:19.548
No birds.

04:39.192 --> 04:41.980
There should be a road
up here or something.

04:42.552 --> 04:45.043
Jack?

04:45.031 --> 04:47.108
Guys?

04:49.273 --> 04:51.680
OK, OK, don't shoot.

04:51.673 --> 04:53.831
That's very sound advice.

04:57.473 --> 04:59.382
Colonel O'Neill.

04:59.393 --> 05:01.682
Lieutenant Connor?

05:01.672 --> 05:03.747
All right, all right, come on.

05:07.233 --> 05:08.774
What's goin' on?

05:08.791 --> 05:13.122
Command received your signal six hours
ago and no one came through. Why?

05:13.031 --> 05:14.692
- Hanson.
- We need to...

05:14.713 --> 05:17.418
- No! Don't.
- Why?

05:19.672 --> 05:22.079
Frakes. He...

05:38.512 --> 05:40.588
Connor.

05:46.112 --> 05:49.362
Connor, I need to know what happened.

05:49.350 --> 05:53.894
Permission to speak freely
about a superior officer, sir.

05:53.790 --> 05:56.411
Yeah, go ahead.

05:56.391 --> 05:59.096
He's lost it. He's out of control.

05:59.191 --> 06:03.271
- Captain Hanson?
- Maybe it was the sun, the radiation.

06:03.192 --> 06:05.350
Are you saying the sun did this to Frakes?

06:05.351 --> 06:08.471
No, sir. Captain Hanson did that to Frakes.

06:08.471 --> 06:10.629
- What?
- We were trying to get back.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.413
I don't buy that.

06:12.430 --> 06:16.559
Sir, we were trying to warn command
about what's really going on.

06:16.471 --> 06:18.925
The people here,
they believe he's their God.

06:18.911 --> 06:22.658
- Because you came through the Stargate.
- No, no, you don't get it.

06:22.589 --> 06:25.127
Hanson believes it too.

06:26.872 --> 06:28.947
<i>Carter?</i>

06:36.471 --> 06:41.845
Take Connor back through the Stargate.
Report to Hammond what's happened.

06:41.709 --> 06:43.951
- No, sir.
- No, sir?

06:44.709 --> 06:48.754
If you're going after Captain Hanson,
I should go with you. I can get to him.

06:48.670 --> 06:54.542
Look, Captain. Either we're bringing
him back to face a court martial or not.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.909
- I think we both know what "not" means.
- I know him, Colonel.

06:57.870 --> 07:01.286
- That would be the problem.
- I gave back the ring because I know him.

07:01.230 --> 07:05.144
- I know how he thinks, how he operates.
- How he likes to play God?

07:05.069 --> 07:07.524
I don't understand how that could happen,

07:07.509 --> 07:09.964
but if SG-1 is going after him,
I am going too.

07:09.949 --> 07:12.403
Wait a minute. No. You can't do that.

07:12.389 --> 07:14.630
There are hundreds, thousands of them.

07:14.629 --> 07:17.879
He's their God.
They'll kill for him in a heartbeat.

07:17.829 --> 07:19.822
That's not your problem.

07:19.829 --> 07:23.661
Now, I need someone to report back
to the general, and that is you.

07:23.588 --> 07:26.079
- No, sir.
- No, sir?

07:26.069 --> 07:28.643
Does it say "Colonel"
anywhere on my uniform?

07:28.668 --> 07:31.338
I know the planet, the situation.

07:31.309 --> 07:35.437
I think it's suicide.
But if you're goin', I'm goin', sir.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.473
- But you're not physically able.
- Frakes was my friend.

07:38.428 --> 07:41.762
- This isn't about revenge.
- Maybe not for you.

07:43.389 --> 07:45.761
We gotta move now, in the daylight.

07:52.668 --> 07:55.040
We're off to see the Wizard.

07:55.028 --> 07:57.437
I hope you packed lots of sun block.

07:57.428 --> 07:59.504
Well, we're mostly under cover.

07:59.507 --> 08:03.504
The probe indicated that shade,
even heavy cloud cover, won't protect us.

08:03.428 --> 08:06.632
- It can be pouring rain and we'll still burn.
- She's right.

08:06.588 --> 08:09.709
Then why on earth
are we travelling during the day?

08:09.668 --> 08:11.791
We're not on Earth.

08:11.788 --> 08:15.370
People here live in caves.
I think they used to be mines.

08:15.307 --> 08:17.430
They only come out at night.

08:17.427 --> 08:19.918
They're probably still after me, sir.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.343
To Oz.

08:49.626 --> 08:52.960
You were right. They sent SG-1.

09:13.985 --> 09:16.109
- Tastes like chicken.
- So what's wrong?

09:16.106 --> 09:18.182
This is macaroni and cheese.

09:23.306 --> 09:26.010
- Teal'c?
- The perimeter is established.

09:30.025 --> 09:35.317
Perfect. If any little rocks sneak up on us,
we'll have plenty of warning.

09:41.106 --> 09:46.267
So, any indigenous lions, tigers or bears
I should lie awake worrying about?

09:46.145 --> 09:48.850
The plant life's all that
seems to live very long.

09:48.825 --> 09:52.277
Now, how could something
like this actually happen?

09:52.225 --> 09:56.602
The SG teams are supposedly
made up of well-trained professionals.

09:56.505 --> 10:00.005
When we met the cave dwellers,
they immediately bowed down to us.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.510
- Thought we were gods.
- That's a fairly common phenomenon.

10:03.466 --> 10:07.509
- I mean, it happens.
- Except Hanson didn't deny it.

10:07.625 --> 10:11.408
Told us it might be safer if we allowed
them to believe he was their God.

10:11.546 --> 10:16.539
Said it was the system of government
they needed to retake their world.

10:16.504 --> 10:18.878
You were OK with that?

10:18.865 --> 10:23.775
Frakes was our anthropologist. He agreed
with Hanson that it might be safer.

10:23.663 --> 10:26.913
But the longer we stayed here,
the stronger they believed.

10:26.864 --> 10:31.192
In our fourth or fifth week here,
a young child wandered out of the caves.

10:31.105 --> 10:33.311
Must have gotten lost.

10:33.304 --> 10:38.429
Hanson went out after him. He was gone
for two full days before he came back,

10:38.344 --> 10:41.961
carrying the child barely alive in his arms.

10:41.903 --> 10:45.984
- They must have loved him for that.
- Yeah, they did.

10:45.904 --> 10:50.484
- He wasn't the same after that.
- That sent him over the edge - the sun?

10:50.384 --> 10:56.587
It wasn't any one thing. If it was, me
and Frakes, we could have seen it comin'.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.831
Done something about it before...

10:58.825 --> 11:01.197
Before what?

11:01.183 --> 11:05.596
There were a few cave dwellers who
got the idea that Hanson was just a man,

11:05.504 --> 11:10.047
like they were, thanks to Frakes and I.

11:09.982 --> 11:13.683
He had them tied to stakes
and left out in the direct sunlight.

11:13.984 --> 11:17.684
If they lived seven days,
they were allowed back in the caves.

11:17.703 --> 11:22.495
A number of significant biblical events
took place over the course of seven days.

11:22.384 --> 11:24.625
By then they were blind.

11:24.624 --> 11:27.115
Giant, bleeding burns all over them.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.791
Just took them a little longer to die.

11:31.383 --> 11:34.384
Personally, I'd rather eat a bullet.

11:40.702 --> 11:42.778
I'll take first watch.

12:36.182 --> 12:39.099
Hey, Colonel, I'll take watch now.

12:54.261 --> 12:57.962
<i>- Let's go. We got company.
- Are you sure?</i>

12:58.822 --> 13:00.730
Pretty sure.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.322
- It appears they are gone.
- Yeah.

13:24.301 --> 13:26.376
Connor?

13:27.181 --> 13:29.672
Connor?

13:47.700 --> 13:50.653
The temple is taking too long to build.

13:50.620 --> 13:53.953
<i>- They're working as hard as they can.
- But not as long as they can.</i>

13:53.899 --> 13:56.437
Divide them into shifts: day and night.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.709
- You can't.
- What?

13:58.698 --> 14:00.774
They'll die.

14:01.899 --> 14:04.057
Sacrifice.

14:04.058 --> 14:06.431
Their way to salvation.

14:09.659 --> 14:14.120
They were instructed to take Connor.
Send us a message Hanson's in control.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.510
- Sounds familiar.
- Which part?

14:16.499 --> 14:19.784
- He likes control.
- Oh.

14:19.740 --> 14:21.863
Well, what did you see in him?

14:21.859 --> 14:26.520
I don't know. I guess I've always had
a soft spot for the lunatic fringe.

14:26.418 --> 14:29.788
- He was... he was charming.
- That's good. Charming is good.

14:29.740 --> 14:32.907
I should be more surprised by this
than I am, but I'm not.

14:32.859 --> 14:36.524
He had this in him, Daniel.
Too many years of black ops.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.498
Typical evaluation of soldiers.

14:38.499 --> 14:43.207
The crazier they are, the more extreme
the situation they seem to be put into.

14:43.097 --> 14:45.768
He wasn't happy when
I broke off the engagement,

14:45.738 --> 14:49.570
but he seemed like he'd pulled himself
together when we met up.

14:49.498 --> 14:51.573
Apparently not.

14:53.739 --> 14:56.110
- What you got, Teal'c?
- This way.

15:39.256 --> 15:42.922
The road out of the valley,
toward the mountain.

16:08.057 --> 16:11.307
- I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- If you are thinking of rescuing Connor...

16:11.258 --> 16:15.966
Not yet. Captain, when the time comes,
I'll need your help to get in the front door.

16:15.856 --> 16:17.932
I'm prepared for that, sir.

16:22.015 --> 16:26.227
- Who will worship him if this continues?
- They're like Abraham.

16:29.134 --> 16:31.258
Who was Abraham?

16:31.256 --> 16:34.423
A biblical figure.
Believed to be the father of man.

16:34.375 --> 16:40.249
God tested his faith by instructing him
to make a great sacrifice - his son Isaac.

16:40.616 --> 16:42.904
Did he sacrifice his son?

16:42.895 --> 16:48.056
He gave it a good shot, before
an angel stopped him... at the last minute.

16:59.216 --> 17:01.292
Get up!

17:01.975 --> 17:05.392
- He's worked straight through the night.
- Shut up!

17:06.414 --> 17:09.535
Do I have to make an example? Do I?!

17:12.535 --> 17:14.611
Ah!

17:14.694 --> 17:17.316
Hey, look over there.

17:20.935 --> 17:24.803
- Whoa. Where are you going?
- I can't watch him beat that man to death.

17:24.815 --> 17:27.981
- You will be captured.
- And you think that's a plan?

17:27.934 --> 17:30.769
I can get to Hanson.
That's what the Colonel was saying.

17:30.734 --> 17:35.314
- Can you at least wait until he gets back?
- The man could be dead by then.

17:37.854 --> 17:41.140
- We should have stopped her.
- We would have failed.

18:08.294 --> 18:10.250
That was refreshing.

18:13.454 --> 18:16.953
Connor looks bad.
There's two guards, but...

18:21.333 --> 18:23.076
Daniel.

18:25.894 --> 18:28.135
Never mind.

18:28.172 --> 18:31.921
It's probably our only way in
without a firefight anyway.

18:43.173 --> 18:45.249
All right, all right.

18:58.932 --> 19:02.468
Well, it's about time.

19:03.532 --> 19:05.608
Hello, Jonas.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.578
And you never thought
I'd amount to anything.

19:11.132 --> 19:16.719
- Quite a leap, isn't it? From captain to...
- What's happened to you, Jonas?

19:16.571 --> 19:19.145
Please, sit down.

19:23.932 --> 19:28.724
These caves were once mines.
They permeate the hillside for miles,

19:28.613 --> 19:32.444
but these people have been
multiplying like rabbits.

19:33.851 --> 19:37.848
They don't have the technology
to dig themselves more space,

19:37.771 --> 19:40.060
or the courage to leave the caves.

19:40.050 --> 19:43.634
<i>It's like a Third World country in a bottle.</i>

19:43.731 --> 19:47.018
- And you think you're saving them?
- Oh, I know I am.

19:50.771 --> 19:55.599
These people,
they're human beings, they're like us.

19:55.491 --> 19:57.567
How can we turn our backs on them?

19:57.770 --> 20:01.269
Kidnapped from Earth,
forced into slavery for centuries...

20:01.290 --> 20:04.874
- We can't change that.
- Yes, we can! We must help!

20:04.810 --> 20:08.180
How does posing as a God
and working them to death help them?

20:08.131 --> 20:10.800
I hate that word! Stop using it!

20:10.770 --> 20:13.440
I am not posing!

20:17.570 --> 20:19.646
It is a matter of definition.

20:20.451 --> 20:22.989
My people need me.

20:22.970 --> 20:25.046
<i>They believe in me.</i>

20:25.050 --> 20:27.459
And because they believe, they work.

20:27.451 --> 20:31.365
- To death.
- We're building a civilisation, Sam.

20:31.770 --> 20:34.012
There are going to be sacrifices.

20:34.011 --> 20:41.223
<i>It's better than rotting in caves, living and
dying in squalor like you've never seen.</i>

20:42.410 --> 20:45.031
I'm creating a great people.

20:45.009 --> 20:47.086
- In your image?
- Yes.

20:48.650 --> 20:51.270
It's going to be wondrous.

20:54.489 --> 20:56.565
You'll see.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.365
You'll see.

21:04.689 --> 21:07.808
We're gonna have to get
one of them alone and talk to him.

21:07.769 --> 21:09.928
They could give us away.

21:10.288 --> 21:13.704
Maybe not. Maybe not.

21:15.888 --> 21:18.843
I think I've got just the candidate.

21:42.808 --> 21:44.054
Shh.

21:45.409 --> 21:49.822
- I wish I understood these drawings.
- Why don't you ask your people?

21:50.528 --> 21:52.605
All-knowing.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.226
- You knew I would come.
- How could you not?

21:57.208 --> 22:00.493
Healer of the emotionally wounded.

22:00.448 --> 22:05.276
I was your one failure. The bird
with the broken wing that wouldn't heal.

22:05.688 --> 22:08.772
You seem to be flying
well enough on your own.

22:08.729 --> 22:11.765
I hoped that you would understand.

22:17.728 --> 22:20.598
I do understand.
You're sick and you need help.

22:21.807 --> 22:24.844
- That's your idea of help?
- Yes.

22:24.807 --> 22:26.931
You're coming back with me.

22:26.926 --> 22:29.798
Well, you're gonna have to use it, Sam.

22:32.807 --> 22:35.298
Go on.

22:35.287 --> 22:37.991
It's still loaded. Pull the trigger.

22:41.127 --> 22:45.954
<i>Do it! Because, so help me, that
is the only way you're gonna stop me.</i>

22:46.488 --> 22:50.983
<i>What's a few deaths compared to
the survival of my people?</i>

22:53.526 --> 22:58.520
Killing their saviour might irritate them
a little, but at least I'd be gone.

22:59.967 --> 23:02.505
Don't make me do this.

23:02.487 --> 23:04.230
Go on.

23:04.247 --> 23:08.624
Pull the trigger
one more fraction of an inch.

23:18.806 --> 23:21.131
You had the gun.

23:21.686 --> 23:24.605
You appeared to have all the power.

23:25.487 --> 23:31.111
Yet I was in control.
That is the strength of a God.

23:35.166 --> 23:38.500
My name is Jamala. Jamala.
Please don't kill me. Please don't...

23:38.445 --> 23:40.403
No. We won't.

23:41.045 --> 23:45.208
Jonas said you would come. Devils
with power like him, here to destroy us.

23:45.126 --> 23:49.872
No, no. We're not devils.
We're men, like yourself.

23:49.766 --> 23:52.304
I'm Daniel, this is Jack and he's Teal'c.

23:52.526 --> 23:54.602
Hi.

23:57.165 --> 23:59.288
- Is he Jaffa?
- Yes.

23:59.724 --> 24:02.808
- Don't kill me.
- No, it's OK. He's friendly.

24:04.164 --> 24:06.240
He's a friend.

24:08.605 --> 24:11.521
See? Smile. Look friendly.

24:11.845 --> 24:14.596
You're gonna have to
work on that a little bit.

24:15.444 --> 24:19.394
Now, how do you know he is Jaffa?
Have you seen one before?

24:19.326 --> 24:24.451
No. Just stories from when
I was a young boy. Long ago.

24:24.443 --> 24:28.358
- He is a servant of the old gods, yes?
- Well, yes and no.

24:28.285 --> 24:30.858
He's from another place. So are we.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.447
- Another place?
- Earth.

24:34.444 --> 24:37.565
It's way... way out there.

24:38.006 --> 24:40.211
Where we're from. Jonas too.

24:40.484 --> 24:44.019
See, he's not a God. He's just a man.
A crazy man, granted, but...

24:43.964 --> 24:47.334
OK, OK. Jonas is bad.

24:48.324 --> 24:51.527
But it's all right. He can't
hear you now. He can't hurt you.

24:51.483 --> 24:55.564
But he will, if you and your people
continue to believe in him and follow him.

24:55.563 --> 24:58.136
- He will save us.
- By labouring you in the sun?

24:58.125 --> 25:01.291
If we finish the temple,
Jonas will make the sky orange.

25:01.243 --> 25:04.493
It'll be safe to be in the light.
There'll be no more sickness.

25:04.564 --> 25:07.102
The sky? Orange?

25:07.923 --> 25:10.674
The sky. Up there.

25:10.644 --> 25:12.720
Yeah, I know what the sky is.

25:13.364 --> 25:16.233
- Why?
- When the sky's orange, it's good.

25:17.682 --> 25:21.728
- There's no more sickness.
- And Jonas can make the sky orange?

25:22.844 --> 25:25.760
- Yes, he can.
- How do you know?

25:26.282 --> 25:30.529
- He says he can.
- Do you know what he's talkin' about?

25:30.442 --> 25:32.768
I believe so.

25:43.722 --> 25:46.345
Going to be magnificent, isn't it?

25:48.163 --> 25:51.746
But why? By the time it's built,
there'll be no one left to worship you.

25:51.682 --> 25:53.675
Please.

25:53.682 --> 25:59.222
Mere survival for these people will require
unquestioning faith, pure devotion.

25:59.083 --> 26:01.490
<i>They must believe in me,</i>

26:01.481 --> 26:04.482
if I am to lead them into the desert,
to the promised land.

26:04.442 --> 26:07.561
I'm merely separating
the wheat from the chaff.

26:08.961 --> 26:12.047
Besides, I'm supposed to be crazy, right?

26:12.002 --> 26:16.048
- I never said you were crazy.
- But you think it, don't you?

26:15.961 --> 26:21.501
That's all right. I still have faith in you,
even if you don't believe in me. Yet.

26:21.363 --> 26:24.398
- You'll come around.
- I don't think so, Jonas.

26:28.481 --> 26:29.680
Come here.

26:31.721 --> 26:35.221
- What is it?
- Something I've seen the Goa'ulds use.

26:35.682 --> 26:38.173
It creates an energy force high in the air.

26:38.162 --> 26:41.662
What? Protection from radiation,
like from this planet's sun?

26:41.601 --> 26:44.270
The device I saw
appeared to turn the sky orange.

26:44.241 --> 26:47.576
The cave paintings tell of this.
They show this symbol.

26:47.561 --> 26:52.472
Have you ever actually seen
one of these things he's talkin' about?

26:52.362 --> 26:53.559
Where?

27:10.602 --> 27:14.895
- What is it?
- Something the Goa'ulds left behind.

27:15.361 --> 27:20.153
What I've gathered from
the local folklore is that the ancient gods

27:20.040 --> 27:24.999
used it to make the sky orange to protect
the people from the sun sickness.

27:24.881 --> 27:27.169
- Some sort of shield.
- Yes.

27:27.961 --> 27:32.173
- You don't know how to work it.
- Not my area of expertise.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.858
You never cared about my coming
because you wanted me.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.842
You just wanted me to figure out
how to turn this thing on.

27:38.799 --> 27:42.750
Oh, no. That's not true.

27:43.799 --> 27:49.173
I sincerely hope that, one day,
you will agree to be my goddess.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.018
- Turn it on.
- What if I won't?

27:55.720 --> 28:01.509
We will watch every last cave dweller
die in the sun before I kill us both.

28:05.719 --> 28:10.510
He hath not failed one word
of his good promises!

28:17.439 --> 28:20.060
I've been carrying this for years.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.315
All along, I've been looking for God.

28:29.878 --> 28:32.037
And here I am.

28:32.719 --> 28:36.717
So, you betrayed your gods
as I am betraying mine?

28:38.079 --> 28:41.200
The beings I betrayed were not gods.

28:41.157 --> 28:45.903
They had power, but power alone
does not make one a God.

28:45.798 --> 28:47.875
Do you understand?

28:48.798 --> 28:51.669
We can't leave Connor out there
another day. He'll die.

28:51.638 --> 28:55.008
We must also help Carter.
But if Teal'c can turn on this device,

28:54.958 --> 28:58.907
- We could undermine Hanson's power.
- There is a problem with your plan.

28:58.959 --> 29:03.038
- You don't know how to turn it on?
- Yes, I can turn it on.

29:02.959 --> 29:05.450
- But there must be two.
- What do you mean?

29:05.478 --> 29:09.012
The technology involves a force field
being bounced back and forth

29:08.958 --> 29:13.121
- Between two devices.
- I have only seen one, in his cave.

29:13.958 --> 29:16.496
Hanson may not know
he needs a second device.

29:16.637 --> 29:19.259
This is the valley.

29:19.238 --> 29:21.810
Here is the Stargate. Here is the temple.

29:21.877 --> 29:24.368
- Good drawing.
- Thank you.

29:25.917 --> 29:28.076
Where was the first device found?

29:33.317 --> 29:35.393
Then the second device...

29:40.237 --> 29:43.653
You're assuming the Goa'ulds
shut 'em down and left them in place.

29:43.676 --> 29:45.799
- That is correct.
- I'm sorry, Teal'c,

29:45.797 --> 29:48.086
but your calculations could be way off.

29:48.077 --> 29:50.828
Connor doesn't have time
for us to be wrong.

29:50.798 --> 29:53.667
I'll go after him. You try
and find that second device.

29:53.637 --> 29:55.713
I'll try to meet you back here.

30:23.955 --> 30:28.950
This place is like where the other one
was found, on the far side of the temple.

30:34.796 --> 30:38.923
This is like solid rock.
We'll never be able to get through this.

30:46.836 --> 30:48.912
Stand aside.

31:21.394 --> 31:23.471
I just hope it still functions.

32:06.233 --> 32:10.183
- Kill me.
- You sure? I've come all this way.

32:16.273 --> 32:18.349
Can you walk?

32:19.073 --> 32:21.148
Let's go.

32:29.353 --> 32:32.222
Think we could pick up
the pace a little here?

32:35.031 --> 32:37.107
You!

32:45.873 --> 32:49.288
Hey, how are you doin'?
You know, we'd love to stick around,

32:49.233 --> 32:53.396
but some braindead sycophant
left my buddy out here to die.

32:53.432 --> 32:55.509
So we're outta here.

32:56.551 --> 32:58.627
Ow.

33:06.192 --> 33:08.269
Move.

33:13.593 --> 33:19.926
Control board seems to follow the same
circuitry patterns as the gate technology.

33:19.751 --> 33:22.289
Just turn it on.

33:22.271 --> 33:24.809
What if I can't?

33:24.791 --> 33:27.034
Colonel O'Neill.

33:27.032 --> 33:31.528
Captain, I see everything
is working out just as we planned.

33:40.671 --> 33:42.913
- Shoot him.
- No!

33:44.351 --> 33:46.426
All right.

33:47.030 --> 33:49.902
Wait. You're gonna
turn this thing on in here?

33:50.231 --> 33:52.355
Do it now.

33:52.351 --> 33:55.137
If it works, I'll spare him.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.335
It's beautiful.

34:20.911 --> 34:23.994
- Will it work?
- I do not know.

34:26.510 --> 34:29.463
Everyone's gathering
at the Circle of the Gods.

34:29.431 --> 34:31.887
The Stargate.

34:32.268 --> 34:34.346
My children.

34:35.190 --> 34:38.806
Today is a great day.

34:39.871 --> 34:43.204
The sun hath stood still in the heavens

34:43.150 --> 34:47.858
and hasteth not to go down
about a whole day.

34:48.510 --> 34:52.460
I have the power to help

34:52.389 --> 34:54.927
and to cast down.

34:55.510 --> 34:59.045
But fear not, stand still,

34:59.590 --> 35:03.753
and see the salvation of the Lord.

35:04.590 --> 35:09.168
Today... we will bury the doorway

35:09.070 --> 35:13.731
that brings forth demons
who threaten to undo us.

35:13.630 --> 35:19.585
But first I will send those evil undoers,
who have already invaded our world,

35:19.429 --> 35:23.012
back to the hell from whence they came.

35:27.268 --> 35:30.389
Fear not, for I, the Lord, your God,

35:30.349 --> 35:34.262
control the gateway to the underworld.

35:48.108 --> 35:50.480
You said you wouldn't kill them.

35:50.469 --> 35:53.007
I'm not. I'm sending them back to Earth.

35:53.188 --> 35:57.353
Without sending the signal
to open the iris, they'll die.

35:57.268 --> 36:00.768
Please, Sam. I'm having a moment here.

36:03.268 --> 36:05.556
I am the Lord, your God.

36:06.148 --> 36:10.775
There is nothing I cannot do.
No one is greater than I.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.503
No one is more powerful than I.

36:15.588 --> 36:17.664
Throw them in.

36:26.626 --> 36:28.702
Wait! Stop!

36:30.708 --> 36:33.114
Back away!

36:40.867 --> 36:42.777
Listen to me.

36:42.789 --> 36:47.414
No matter what Jonas has shown you
or done for you, he is not a God.

36:47.307 --> 36:51.007
Don't listen to him! They are demons!

36:50.947 --> 36:53.983
Agents of the devil. I am your saviour!

36:53.947 --> 36:56.521
We're not demons, for cryin' out loud!

36:56.706 --> 36:58.782
And this...

36:59.545 --> 37:03.081
This is not magical power.

37:03.027 --> 37:05.981
It is called a gun and it is a machine.

37:08.067 --> 37:11.068
Do as I say, or you will all die!

37:11.027 --> 37:13.150
<i>Do as he says and you will die!</i>

37:13.266 --> 37:16.681
Do not betray me
after all I've done for you!

37:16.626 --> 37:20.458
I promised you I would bring you
out of the caves into the light!

37:20.505 --> 37:24.967
Today I fulfil that promise!

37:24.865 --> 37:30.108
Behold... the magical power
that belongs to your God!

37:30.586 --> 37:35.829
I give you the sun! I give you the world!

37:50.865 --> 37:52.490
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

37:52.505 --> 37:54.297
<i>- Fix it.
- It's a machine.</i>

37:54.306 --> 37:58.635
I can make it work and so can you,
just like Jamala there can fire that staff.

37:58.545 --> 38:00.668
Now, I'll show you how.

38:00.666 --> 38:05.208
There are two devices, and both
must be turned on for the shield to work.

38:05.105 --> 38:06.978
Watch.

38:28.344 --> 38:31.215
I'm takin' you with me.

38:51.105 --> 38:53.347
Aargh!

39:03.905 --> 39:05.981
Uh, I think we're ready.

39:07.623 --> 39:10.541
Think we should tell 'em
to bury the gate when we're gone?

39:10.503 --> 39:13.291
Teal'c seems to think
the Goa'ulds won't be back.

39:13.264 --> 39:16.300
Maybe we should come back
and check on these guys.

39:16.264 --> 39:18.672
I think we've done enough. Don't you?

39:28.463 --> 39:30.586
Somethin' else on your mind?

39:30.583 --> 39:34.367
I had the chance to end this, Colonel.
He literally asked me to do it.

39:34.382 --> 39:37.088
Killing a man is
no badge of honour, Captain.

39:37.063 --> 39:39.139
I know.

39:40.382 --> 39:43.467
Look, I'm no expert on this thing.

39:43.862 --> 39:47.610
I generally remember one commandment.
I think it's the first.

39:47.543 --> 39:51.755
"I am the Lord, your God, and
you shall take no other gods before me."

39:52.222 --> 39:54.594
OK, it's not the first one.

39:54.702 --> 39:59.329
I'm talking about the no-killing one.
No matter what the reason,

39:59.222 --> 40:03.005
every time you break it,
you take one step closer to Hanson.

40:04.023 --> 40:06.181
Thanks.

40:16.063 --> 40:18.304
So, you gonna be all right?

40:18.302 --> 40:20.130
Yes.

40:22.023 --> 40:26.186
The world outside the caves,
it's very big, yes?

40:26.101 --> 40:28.675
Yeah, it's bigger than you can imagine.
