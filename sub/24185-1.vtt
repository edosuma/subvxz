02:42.126 --> 02:45.251
Based on the novel Double Face
by Jef Geeraerts

03:11.459 --> 03:13.167
Mr Verstuyft.
- Sorry.

03:13.334 --> 03:14.792
Here.
- I've already got one.

03:14.959 --> 03:16.042
Here.

03:16.876 --> 03:17.959
Thank you.

04:11.667 --> 04:13.251
Good evening, Eva.
- Freddy.

04:13.417 --> 04:15.751
You're looking fantastic again.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.500
Hmm, and it smells good already.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.916
It was this evening, wasn't it?

04:22.084 --> 04:23.376
Freddy?

04:25.542 --> 04:27.417
It's next Friday.

04:28.292 --> 04:29.376
Really?

04:30.917 --> 04:31.959
YES.

04:32.459 --> 04:36.792
And the day before that and the day
before that. Come on then, come in.

04:36.959 --> 04:40.042
There's more than enough.
I'll set another place.

04:41.709 --> 04:44.084
I'll get another plate.
- OK.

04:52.584 --> 04:56.042
Vincke should have been made
Superintendent ages ago.

04:57.376 --> 05:00.792
But I'm convinced certain people are
preventing it from happening.

05:00.959 --> 05:03.626
The person preventing it
from happening is here.

05:03.792 --> 05:08.167
Who? Me?
- No, no, silly. No, me.

05:08.334 --> 05:11.501
I wouldn't want to be responsible
for so many people.

05:11.667 --> 05:15.209
And besides, I'd be a terrible boss.
- That's true.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.209
You're a difficult man.

05:18.876 --> 05:20.209
And a right fusspot.

05:22.542 --> 05:25.084
God, this is good wine.
- No, thanks.

05:25.251 --> 05:26.501
I'll write the name down.

05:26.667 --> 05:30.959
I'll get it translated into Bulgarian then
the guy in the night store can order some.

05:31.126 --> 05:33.209
Eh?
- Nothing.

05:55.834 --> 05:57.084
Freddy.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.584
Didn't you hear your phone?
- Yeah.

06:01.042 --> 06:06.542
A call-out.
- Yeah. A call-out. There, ready.

06:59.251 --> 07:02.501
No ID in the clothes.
The labels have been cut out.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.917
Fingertips have been burned off,
probably with acid.

07:06.084 --> 07:07.626
All the blood has drained away.

07:07.792 --> 07:11.042
And I needn't hope for any footprints
or tyre tracks, eh?

07:11.209 --> 07:12.376
In that loose sand?

07:15.584 --> 07:17.834
You let him leave?
- You mean Bertie?

07:18.001 --> 07:20.334
He's just an elderly bricklayer
from the village.

07:20.501 --> 07:23.751
A bricklayer? What was he doing here
at 5 in the morning?

07:23.917 --> 07:28.917
He's been caught snaring rabbits a few
times. You'll get a copy of his statement.

07:30.209 --> 07:33.459
Nothing special, apart from the fact
he heard a car drive off.

07:33.626 --> 07:37.959
Personally, I think
he disturbed the perpetrator.

07:38.584 --> 07:42.334
That's what I think. The perpetrator
dropped everything and fled.

07:42.501 --> 07:44.709
Dropped everything?
What about the head then?

07:47.792 --> 07:50.251
Come on, search. Come on, search.

08:12.876 --> 08:14.167
We've got something here.

08:14.334 --> 08:17.667
Be careful. Make sure
it doesn't damage anything.

08:29.626 --> 08:31.667
There's something here too.

08:35.751 --> 08:37.167
Something here as well.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.001
Something here too.

08:57.126 --> 09:02.334
Is she among them? I want to see her.
- We don't know yet, Mrs Tissot.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.251
I can tell if it's her.
I'm her mother.

09:06.001 --> 09:10.167
Yes. But there's no need
for you personally...

09:10.334 --> 09:15.501
I mean, if your daughter is among them
the lab will identify her.

09:15.667 --> 09:20.917
She's got three moles here.
- Yes, it's in her file.

09:21.084 --> 09:24.792
We also have her DNA. I imagine
we will probably know tomorrow...

09:24.959 --> 09:27.584
No, not tomorrow. Please, no, now.

09:27.751 --> 09:31.876
I know where those moles are.
I can show you right away.

09:32.042 --> 09:36.834
I realize that, madam. But we have
to follow a certain protocol.

09:38.626 --> 09:41.792
Hold on a minute. Eh?
Sit there.

09:55.501 --> 09:59.126
This is the most recent victim.

10:19.834 --> 10:20.917
How far have you got?

10:21.084 --> 10:24.292
Six at once, our department
isn't equipped for that, eh?

10:24.459 --> 10:28.417
I've done an initial external examination
of the three that have decayed the least

10:28.584 --> 10:33.501
and I haven't yet found anything on the
bodies themselves that indicates violence.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.959
No violence?
- No.

10:35.292 --> 10:38.626
Not on the latest victim either?
- No. And I don't know how fresh it is,

10:38.792 --> 10:42.126
I think the body's been in the freezer.
- In the freezer?

10:43.376 --> 10:44.917
All of them? The others too?

10:45.334 --> 10:48.292
So how can you say with any certainty
when they died?

10:48.459 --> 10:51.376
Well, that was already very difficult
but now...

10:51.751 --> 10:54.376
I've asked Ghent for assistance.
- Good morning.

10:54.542 --> 10:56.709
Good morning. Good morning.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.584
I'm sorry.

11:22.959 --> 11:25.334
Is there anyone we can call?

11:29.292 --> 11:30.459
Madam?

11:34.626 --> 11:37.209
I'll get someone from Victim Support
to come.

11:46.084 --> 11:49.126
Morning. Morning.
- Morning.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.251
Morning.

12:02.709 --> 12:05.001
Freddy.
- I'll be right with you.

12:10.334 --> 12:14.501
Good morning.
- Have any more victims been identified?

12:14.667 --> 12:18.501
Yes, one of the older bodies had had
some serious operations on the tibia.

12:18.667 --> 12:22.292
Vera Vandijk.
Missing for more than three years.

12:22.459 --> 12:26.584
Her bike was found in Breda at the time,
halfway between a nightclub and her house.

12:26.751 --> 12:30.042
Breda? That's at least 40 km from
where the body was found.

12:30.209 --> 12:33.959
That's why we're checking
all disappearances in a 50 km radius.

12:35.084 --> 12:38.126
That's not many, eh?
Did you go back five years?

12:38.292 --> 12:41.834
No, not yet. We're waiting for some files
from the Netherlands too.

12:42.001 --> 12:43.001
OK.

13:02.209 --> 13:07.459
Elise Tissot, 25. Julia Steegmans, 44.
Tissot, librarian.

13:07.626 --> 13:11.459
Vera Vandijk, doing a PhD in biochemistry.
Iris Sluys was a prostitute.

13:11.626 --> 13:16.292
She's small and voluptuous while Tissot
is more of the model type, shall we say.

13:16.459 --> 13:20.459
Blonde hair, brown, black.
No similarities.

13:20.626 --> 13:22.959
That's what I mean.
- Why would they be similar?

13:23.126 --> 13:25.334
A serial killer goes for
a certain type, eh?

13:25.501 --> 13:28.042
Why? I've had girlfriends
in all shapes and sizes.

13:28.209 --> 13:30.584
Yes, and in all price categories.

13:33.001 --> 13:36.459
That's not funny, Benji.
- Why them? That's what we want to know.

13:36.626 --> 13:40.126
I want you to go through their laptops,
Facebook page, social media,

13:40.292 --> 13:43.751
videos, everything.
Why them? What's the connection?

13:43.917 --> 13:46.751
They were the easiest prey
in that place at that time.

13:47.126 --> 13:50.001
I want to contact an old friend of mine,
Anton Mulder.

13:50.167 --> 13:53.584
Mulder? The Dutchman?
- A profiler, wow.

13:53.751 --> 13:58.501
Vincke, come on, not a profiler? You might
just as well ask a fortune-teller.

13:58.876 --> 14:02.542
Well, I'm going to ask him.
This case is too big to do it on our own.

14:03.376 --> 14:07.001
A Dutchman, guys.
Great, great, great.

14:07.751 --> 14:09.959
They've found a woman in Doel.

14:31.126 --> 14:33.792
Well, well,
the kindergarten cops are here.

14:33.959 --> 14:35.667
Hello.
- Good morning.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.501
Where is she?

14:38.959 --> 14:44.417
She's not there anymore.
She's no longer where he said she was.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.542
He? Who's he?

14:46.709 --> 14:49.959
A guy on a bike who thought he saw
a dead woman as he was cycling along.

14:50.292 --> 14:54.626
Thought? He didn't go and look?
- No, he cycled straight to the station.

14:54.792 --> 14:57.542
He looked more dead
than alive himself so...

14:58.792 --> 15:00.376
As white as a sheet,

15:01.251 --> 15:04.501
from the shock.
- Oh, was it a ghost?

15:04.667 --> 15:06.209
Freddy.

15:07.209 --> 15:11.209
Let's go and see, come on.
- Come on. We're going this way.

15:40.209 --> 15:41.209
Madam?

15:42.251 --> 15:44.042
We're from the police.

15:49.042 --> 15:52.251
Freddy Verstuyft, Chief Inspector.

16:03.292 --> 16:05.126
Goddammit.

16:06.626 --> 16:11.417
Come on, come here. Come here.
It's OK, it's OK. Here, it's OK. Here.

16:14.292 --> 16:16.001
There, that's better.

16:19.876 --> 16:22.042
Do I know you from somewhere?

16:27.292 --> 16:29.501
I'll put the heating on.
- Yeah.

16:35.459 --> 16:39.959
Oh... My hair is red.

16:46.751 --> 16:48.668
There.
- Thank you.

16:51.001 --> 16:54.209
Do you remember where you were
yesterday and last night?

16:58.209 --> 17:05.416
I had to... I had to get away from that
party and it was too cold and dark and...

17:05.584 --> 17:12.459
and it was... it was dirty and
there was a lot of dust and I... I...

17:13.666 --> 17:16.959
I couldn't... I couldn't breathe.

17:18.876 --> 17:22.084
That wound on your arm, may I see it?

17:25.166 --> 17:26.459
How did you get it?

17:29.376 --> 17:33.042
From... from the car.

17:35.501 --> 17:37.001
Your car.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.292
How did you get here?
Can you remember?

17:53.001 --> 17:57.334
Must've been a wild party.
Don't you know her? Eh? Rina Van Lierde?

17:57.501 --> 18:02.042
A sort of psychologist. Wheeled out when
they want someone to criticize the police.

18:02.209 --> 18:05.376
Been in debates with
her book about psychoactive drugs.

18:05.542 --> 18:10.626
Vincke, a debate about a book?
No wonder I don't know her.

18:10.792 --> 18:13.667
I think she has sniffed and swallowed
too much from her book

18:13.834 --> 18:16.584
and, combined with alcohol,
this is what you get.

18:17.917 --> 18:21.626
Or maybe he put something in her drink.
Maybe she was the next victim.

18:21.792 --> 18:25.126
But our killer was busy digging
in the sand the night before last.

18:25.292 --> 18:29.501
Maybe he was busy digging in order to
make room for her in his freezer.

18:29.667 --> 18:32.001
No, just totally wasted
after some serious partying.

18:32.167 --> 18:37.292
The hi-viz vest and hair died red looks
more like a prank by dodgy friends.

18:38.417 --> 18:43.501
I'll ask Vice to look at her case and
if there's a connection...

18:44.626 --> 18:46.042
we'll hear about it.

18:48.667 --> 18:52.084
Mulder.
- Hi, Eric.

18:52.251 --> 18:55.501
Oh, man, it's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

18:56.251 --> 19:00.251
Well.
- Sorry. Freddy, Anton Mulder.

19:00.584 --> 19:02.209
Hi. Hello, Freddy.
- Mulder.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.169
Great to have you on board.
- Great, great, great.

19:05.376 --> 19:08.834
Mulder has set up
a joint investigation team at Europol.

19:09.001 --> 19:12.751
Great, great, great. Cassiers,
can you take these cases to the hotel?

19:12.917 --> 19:15.292
Which one?
- No, to my place.

19:15.459 --> 19:17.876
Vincke thought it'd be nice
it I stayed with him.

19:18.042 --> 19:20.125
Oh, cosy.

19:20.292 --> 19:23.959
Mulder uses lists of fuzzy logic questions
to draw up his perpetrator profile

19:24.126 --> 19:28.709
and ViCLAS, the Canadian upgrade of
ViCAP, which the FBI uses.

19:28.876 --> 19:33.959
I know ViCLAS. Eighty per cent of
the questions are about the crime scene.

19:34.126 --> 19:37.584
Shame we don't have a crime scene.
- Sorry, we have to leave now

19:37.751 --> 19:42.334
for the Public Prosecutor's briefing.
No, Freddy, three oi us going is silly,

19:42.501 --> 19:48.417
so I suggest you input the autopsy and
search reports into ViCLAS. Thanks.

19:49.292 --> 19:51.417
OK, see you later.
- Yeah. Bye.

19:51.584 --> 19:52.751
Bye.

19:55.626 --> 20:00.376
Go on, Cassiers. You heard him.
Tap tap tap tap tap. Come on.

20:48.709 --> 20:52.209
I don't understand. Am I in danger?
- No, no, no, no.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.501
Look, I'm here for my own peace of mind,

20:54.667 --> 20:58.834
I wanted to be sure you weren't taken
by the man we're looking for.

20:59.001 --> 21:00.376
What if I were?

21:01.834 --> 21:07.876
If you were then... then you are
an important witness.

21:08.042 --> 21:13.584
A witness with a black hole in her memory.
- Anything you can remember may help us.

21:15.417 --> 21:17.126
Only bits and pieces.

21:19.542 --> 21:22.792
A party, some people.

21:23.542 --> 21:24.959
A club.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.292
Gin and tonic.

21:30.334 --> 21:31.917
Gin without tonic.

21:36.376 --> 21:37.917
OK.

21:50.292 --> 21:54.417
What a stupid question! Doesn't that chick
know whether she was here or not?

21:54.626 --> 21:57.417
I'm asking you, pal.

22:00.751 --> 22:04.001
Are there cameras here?
- Cameras...

22:05.001 --> 22:06.417
We've got eyes, we have.

22:12.084 --> 22:13.209
And?

22:14.792 --> 22:18.459
What, and?
- Was she here, yes or no?

22:19.709 --> 22:22.751
May have been. I wouldn't know.

22:25.417 --> 22:27.876
Right, thanks.
- You're welcome.

22:29.376 --> 22:33.042
Yes, honey?
- Abi. It's me.

22:33.209 --> 22:37.167
Can you check whether there are
any CCTV cameras near the Roxy?

22:37.334 --> 22:41.417
Anything for you.
Oh, a call has come in from Doel.

22:41.584 --> 22:43.042
Doel?
- Yes, Doel.

22:44.084 --> 22:46.876
It was the night before
and nothing was stolen,

22:47.042 --> 22:51.167
just a dog's blanket and a hi-viz vest,
and I immediately thought of you.

22:51.334 --> 22:54.459
Sorry, I must have been cold, I suppose.

22:55.126 --> 22:59.292
We found her there so if she came past
here she must've come from Doel village.

22:59.459 --> 23:00.792
Yeah, yeah.

23:01.501 --> 23:03.626
OK. Thanks.

23:05.542 --> 23:10.209
I... I can remember hands on my face.

23:10.959 --> 23:15.167
With cold water and...
someone fiddling with my hair.

23:15.459 --> 23:18.459
Yeah, yeah.
- There was something over my eyes.

23:18.626 --> 23:20.917
Tape? Blindfold?

23:22.167 --> 23:27.334
Did he say anything maybe?
- I don't remember a voice but...

23:28.959 --> 23:31.292
I think I was lying there a long time.

23:33.209 --> 23:36.376
Anything else you remember?
- Yes.

23:37.917 --> 23:39.209
A smell.

23:41.251 --> 23:42.667
Grain.

23:43.792 --> 23:45.667
The smell of grain.

23:56.959 --> 23:58.209
Is it here?

23:58.751 --> 24:00.084
I think so.

24:06.876 --> 24:10.459
And? What do you think?
Were you here?

24:13.209 --> 24:17.167
Or does anything seem familiar?
- Yes, the smell.

24:17.334 --> 24:20.292
And that dust, it catches my breath.

24:25.792 --> 24:29.376
There isn't any plastic.
I have a feeling I was lying on plastic.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.917
A sheet of plastic is easily removed.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.292
Goddammit.

24:47.084 --> 24:48.501
Come here.

24:51.334 --> 24:52.459
Come here.

24:53.417 --> 24:56.417
Keep your head still. Relax.

24:58.251 --> 25:01.042
Got one.
- Ow.

25:02.542 --> 25:06.251
I was just starting to like you,
for a cop.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.376
I'm going to have
the dye on your hair analysed.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.167
A little souvenir.

25:16.292 --> 25:17.834
Abi, babe, can you take this...

25:18.001 --> 25:20.209
Hold on. What?
- to the lab for me. Urgently.

25:20.376 --> 25:23.417
No, no.
Go ahead.

25:24.334 --> 25:25.709
How come?

25:25.876 --> 25:29.626
It depends. I'll call them in a minute.

25:31.959 --> 25:35.792
OK, guys, your attention a minute.
There have been some new developments.

25:35.959 --> 25:40.667
Europol has linked our bodies to
three older cases in the Cologne area.

25:41.042 --> 25:46.209
The bodies were found on Wahner Heide
between March 2011 and April 2013.

25:46.376 --> 25:49.042
So our new priority,
we are looking for men

25:49.209 --> 25:54.417
who moved here from April 2013 from the
Cologne area, permanently or temporarily.

25:54.584 --> 25:57.292
So get on with it.
- Yeah, or heads will roll.

25:57.459 --> 25:58.792
Haha.

25:59.834 --> 26:03.084
It's not possible to say for sure
if sexual violence was used.

26:03.251 --> 26:06.917
But I've found traces of glue
on the most recent one.

26:07.084 --> 26:11.167
On the skin. Arms, legs.
- Taped together.

26:12.584 --> 26:13.959
And the cause of death?

26:15.167 --> 26:18.209
They... just...

26:18.751 --> 26:20.876
stopped living.

26:23.251 --> 26:26.917
I can't say.
Nor can my colleagues from Ghent.

26:27.376 --> 26:30.667
There are no wounds on the body,
no traces of poison.

26:30.834 --> 26:34.542
The organs suddenly stopped.
- Shot in the head?

26:34.709 --> 26:38.459
Hit, the jugular vein cut, stabbed from
behind with something thin and pointed.

26:38.626 --> 26:41.209
Without the head itself I can't say.

26:41.376 --> 26:43.917
How was the head...
- Removed?

26:44.084 --> 26:47.167
The head was removed mechanically,
with an angle grinder.

26:47.334 --> 26:51.584
Certainly something with a fine cutting
action, some kind of saw is possible too.

26:51.751 --> 26:54.959
Done very cleanly, I must say.

26:57.334 --> 27:02.251
Why's Harm Schliindorfer now on the B list?
- Intensive chemo and has relapsed.

27:03.167 --> 27:04.417
OK.

27:04.959 --> 27:08.209
Right. People who moved here
from the Cologne area.

27:08.501 --> 27:12.209
Steve Serluppens, musician.
Ronald Hoybergs, game developer.

27:12.376 --> 27:16.501
Conrad Breitner, a NATO soldier.
Bas Van der Gracht, a stockbroker.

27:16.667 --> 27:19.709
And Ezra Cody,
he works at the American embassy.

27:19.876 --> 27:25.251
Haven't received everything yet but, apart
from traffic fines, no criminal records.

27:25.417 --> 27:27.834
Not unusual for serial killers.
- Here.

27:28.001 --> 27:29.251
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

27:31.001 --> 27:32.209
Excuse me?

27:32.376 --> 27:36.459
I want to show the photos to Rina. Maybe
she'll recognize someone from the club.

27:36.626 --> 27:37.709
Rina? Is that the...

27:37.876 --> 27:42.376
The wasted writer we picked up at Doel.
Vice is dealing with the case.

27:42.542 --> 27:46.542
I know, but I just want to show her
the photos. Sol can put my mind at rest.

27:46.709 --> 27:51.459
Is waving those photos around before those
people have been screened a good idea?

27:51.709 --> 27:54.876
Come on.
- No, we're doing it Mulder's way now.

27:55.042 --> 27:57.834
Come on.
- Let's see what's here first.

27:59.584 --> 28:01.334
YES.

28:01.501 --> 28:04.167
At the roundabout, turn right.

28:04.334 --> 28:07.834
Straight ahead.
When by? By yesterday, Kris.

28:08.001 --> 28:10.709
It said turn right.
- Straight ahead, straight ahead.

28:10.876 --> 28:15.834
Kris, I want the hair analysis first.
Top priority. Understand?

28:16.001 --> 28:17.834
Make a U-turn if possible.

28:18.001 --> 28:19.792
Here, onto that driveway.

28:29.792 --> 28:33.084
What is this place?
- What do you think?

28:33.626 --> 28:35.001
A car park.

28:48.042 --> 28:50.417
Behind Vincke's back.
I don't feel good about this.

28:50.584 --> 28:55.626
If you don't feel good, ask for a pill.
I'm sure they'll have one for you here.

29:00.084 --> 29:04.709
Hi.
- Gentlemen. Come into my office.

29:18.209 --> 29:22.626
This is my colleague Cassiers.
Sorry to disturb you at work

29:22.792 --> 29:26.917
but I wanted to show you these
as soon as possible. Here.

29:28.417 --> 29:29.917
That's them.

29:30.584 --> 29:32.292
Take your time.

29:42.251 --> 29:43.751
Do you recognise him?

29:44.292 --> 29:51.042
No, just a vague feeling of familiarity.
But I often get that feeling.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.959
I felt it very strongly with you too.

29:55.542 --> 29:58.250
Yet I know for sure
I'd never seen you before.

29:59.751 --> 30:01.876
I would've remembered that.

30:04.084 --> 30:08.501
So... you had a vague feeling
about this one?

30:08.667 --> 30:12.667
It's gone now and I don't want
to accuse anyone falsely so...

30:13.959 --> 30:17.251
But something may come back later.
May I keep them?

30:17.417 --> 30:20.417
No, we'd rather you didn't.
They're from a current case.

30:21.251 --> 30:25.001
Those are copies I made specially for you.
Here, keep them.

30:30.376 --> 30:32.501
I have to report that, Freddy.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.834
Cassiers, don't forget you owe me, pal.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.792
Come on.
- I've just got one thing to say.

30:37.959 --> 30:39.917
Dirty Dave. Dirty Dave.

30:40.084 --> 30:44.126
I've paid you back a hundred times.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is now 101.

30:44.292 --> 30:46.959
My silence is priceless, my friend.

31:04.167 --> 31:06.542
Friday night?

31:06.709 --> 31:09.292
My husband looked after Zachary.
I went to a staff party.

31:09.459 --> 31:13.209
Zachary, do we do that? No, we don't,
not on people's leg. Sorry.

31:13.376 --> 31:17.001
Oh, someone seems to have
filled her pamper.

32:16.834 --> 32:21.042
A normal man.
- Yes. A very normal man, eh?

32:21.209 --> 32:24.167
So keep him under surveillance.

32:44.834 --> 32:47.084
Follow me...
- Sure.

32:51.876 --> 32:54.709
Mr Hoybergs?
These people are from the police.

32:54.876 --> 32:56.834
We'll continue our meeting later.

32:57.001 --> 33:01.251
Hoybergs, CEO of Fly Swat Games.
- Verstuyft, pleased to meet you.

33:01.417 --> 33:05.334
How can I help you?
- A few questions. You lived in Cologne.

33:05.501 --> 33:09.167
All over Germany.
My father was a major in the army

33:09.334 --> 33:12.209
and we must've lived on
all the Belgian bases.

33:12.376 --> 33:18.417
Right. But between 2011 and 2013
you were in Cologne.

33:18.584 --> 33:21.626
Oh, from memory...

33:21.792 --> 33:25.084
Except for a few months for
a workshop in LA, yes. I think so.

33:25.251 --> 33:29.126
Do you know which months?
- My secretary can look it up.

33:29.292 --> 33:31.584
Is there a particular reason
why it is important?

33:31.751 --> 33:36.959
Well, you're on a list.
- Oh. What an honour.

33:42.167 --> 33:44.959
Freddy? Come here.

33:46.459 --> 33:47.667
YES?

33:49.251 --> 33:52.292
I've received the lab report
for an urgent job.

33:52.459 --> 33:55.084
That's quick.
I made an impression.

33:55.251 --> 33:59.167
Lab requests always go via me, Freddy.
You know that.

33:59.334 --> 34:03.251
You can't order your own tests.
The labs can hardly keep up as it is.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.334
Yeah, OK.
- No, it's not OK.

34:05.501 --> 34:09.667
Rina van Lierde is Vice's case now.
Full stop.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.583
What does the test say?

34:18.126 --> 34:21.376
Rina van Lierde's hair was dyed
with Party Hair,

34:21.542 --> 34:24.833
a temporary, easy-to-remove spray
or mousse.

34:25.001 --> 34:27.167
Right. Something anyone can use.

34:27.333 --> 34:32.917
Freddy, analysis of the hairs themselves
indicates regular use of pills and coke.

34:33.083 --> 34:36.458
So I think our Miss Party Hair was
off her face for a while.

34:36.626 --> 34:40.458
Vice thinks so too. It's not the first
time she's disappeared for a few days.

34:40.626 --> 34:43.083
Or that she's been picked up
under the influence.

34:43.251 --> 34:48.333
What about what she remembers?
- Could be autosuggestion.

34:48.501 --> 34:51.333
You get that with binge drinking
and black-outs,

34:51.501 --> 34:56.708
gaps in the brain are filled with
the first information that comes along.

34:56.876 --> 35:02.084
Via the media, Facebook, Twitter.
- Or memories that come back.

35:04.042 --> 35:06.917
Or is that too simple for profilers?

35:15.167 --> 35:16.167
PROZAC

35:22.334 --> 35:24.626
It's nice you asked him.

35:25.334 --> 35:27.459
He's very good at what he does.

35:28.251 --> 35:31.042
It's not too soon?
- No.

35:32.167 --> 35:34.834
It's not. He says
he has everything under control.

35:35.001 --> 35:37.459
As long as Freddy doesn't keep
having a go at him.

35:37.626 --> 35:40.084
Can't you just tell Freddy?

35:40.251 --> 35:43.167
Tell him Mulder's recovering from
serious depression?

35:43.334 --> 35:47.709
Freddy doesn't know what's going on in his
own head. And he's wasting time on a lead.

35:47.876 --> 35:52.792
Let me guess. A female lead?
- Yes. And his...

35:52.959 --> 35:56.167
His gut feeling insists this woman has
something to do with our case

35:56.334 --> 35:59.751
but I'm afraid this is
a feeling from below his gut.

36:00.001 --> 36:04.209
Not just here but in Cologne too all six
were going somewhere at night alone.

36:04.501 --> 36:08.459
On foot or by bike.
From a bar, a nightclub, a bar,

36:08.626 --> 36:11.251
a nightshift.
After an argument with her boyfriend.

36:11.417 --> 36:15.709
Because it's an organised perpetrator, we
can assume he calmly watches his victims

36:15.876 --> 36:18.626
until the right moment occurs to strike.

36:18.792 --> 36:21.376
The physical murder doesn't satisfy him.

36:21.792 --> 36:26.292
He dumps the bodies
but he keeps the heads.

36:26.459 --> 36:30.834
So it's about the heads for him.
And his motives are sexual.

36:31.001 --> 36:35.792
He wants to reconstruct something,
probably a traumatic event from the past.

36:35.959 --> 36:38.542
And he needs those heads for that.

36:38.709 --> 36:43.209
Excuse me, excuse me.
Those heads don't look like each other.

36:43.376 --> 36:47.001
In your theory those heads should
resemble someone from his past, eh?

36:47.167 --> 36:50.542
Yes, you've got a point but...

36:50.709 --> 36:54.917
a perpetrator is creative and
a head is easy to alter. Make-up, wigs.

36:55.209 --> 36:57.626
Dye hair. Dye hair, eh?

36:57.917 --> 37:01.542
We have to go by victims we're sure about.
- OK.

37:01.709 --> 37:06.917
Right. That's why we are going to
dig deep into these men's past. OK?

37:07.084 --> 37:11.959
School, work, hobbies, social media.
Mulder will give you the full checklist.

37:12.126 --> 37:15.209
It's important you till in the questions
in a uniform way

37:15.376 --> 37:17.459
so the computer can process them.

37:17.626 --> 37:21.834
Well, lads. We're no longer needed.
The computer's going to solve it.

37:25.209 --> 37:27.959
Stop having ago at Mulder.

37:28.459 --> 37:31.542
Just pointing out the weak points of
this profiling hocus-pocus.

37:31.709 --> 37:33.751
It's not hocus-pocus.

37:33.917 --> 37:37.126
He tries to predict behaviour.
Behaviour can't be predicted.

37:37.292 --> 37:40.292
Behaviour is very predictable.
Especially yours.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.126
Rina is a case for Vice,

37:42.292 --> 37:44.917
we're investigating the past of
those men from Cologne.

37:45.084 --> 37:49.209
Yeah, yeah. But sticking to
one perpetrator profile is never good.

37:49.376 --> 37:51.542
You can end up heading nowhere.

37:51.709 --> 37:55.376
It's up to you if you don't believe in
profiling. Moan about it in the bar.

37:55.542 --> 37:59.125
But here in my department
we are now following Mulder's method.

37:59.292 --> 38:00.626
Your department?
- Yes.

38:00.792 --> 38:02.751
So why are you letting him take charge?

38:02.917 --> 38:07.459
Other countries are involved. It's logical
someone from Europol coordinates it.

38:07.626 --> 38:11.709
Why are you letting him take charge?
- I'm still in charge.

38:11.876 --> 38:18.584
And I'm saying stop it. Stop the moaning.
And no going solo. Stop it.

38:19.709 --> 38:23.792
You work as part of the team or
you don't work here. Understand?

38:25.209 --> 38:26.459
Understand?
- Yeah, yeah.

38:26.626 --> 38:27.792
Thank you.

38:42.251 --> 38:43.876
Hi. Here you go.

38:45.626 --> 38:51.376
Seen any movement?
- No. Only from the meat in your wrap.

38:53.209 --> 38:56.417
Oops, heads-up.
- Goddammit.

38:56.584 --> 38:58.751
They can smell it when we start eating.

38:58.917 --> 39:02.334
Oscar 26 to dispatch. Cody is leaving,
we're following. Beta team stand by.

39:02.667 --> 39:05.459
Take that.
- Go, go, go. Benji?

39:05.792 --> 39:06.834
What the fuck?

39:13.084 --> 39:14.834
Sir?

39:15.001 --> 39:16.626
Sir?

39:18.959 --> 39:22.626
The American embassy doesn't like
you shadowing Mr Cody.

39:22.792 --> 39:26.417
Shadowing? We just happened to be
in his vicinity regularly.

39:26.584 --> 39:28.667
Whatever.
It wasn't inconspicuous enough.

39:28.834 --> 39:32.167
We never obstructed
Mr Cody's freedom of movement.

39:32.334 --> 39:34.376
I should hope not.

39:35.042 --> 39:38.709
You must realise, Mr Vincke,
in cases in which diplomats are involved,

39:38.876 --> 39:43.542
especially American diplomats,
political pressure is considerable.

39:43.709 --> 39:45.709
The ambassador himself protested

39:45.876 --> 39:50.251
against the unwarranted harassment of
an American citizen.

39:50.626 --> 39:53.876
So I'm asking you
how serious is your suspicion of him?

39:54.042 --> 39:56.584
We're at the start oi our investigation,
as you know,

39:56.751 --> 39:59.876
but he is one of the eleven
who moved here from Cologne.

40:00.042 --> 40:02.459
Moving here isn't yet a crime.

40:02.626 --> 40:05.459
Certainly not it you leave Germany.
It's called good taste.

40:05.626 --> 40:07.793
Let me talk to him.

40:07.959 --> 40:11.834
Mr Cody seemed to be a reasonable man
who appreciated we had a job to do.

40:12.001 --> 40:17.001
As I understand it, it was at Mr Cody's
request that the ambassador stepped in.

40:18.042 --> 40:19.584
I'm sorry, Vincke.

40:36.376 --> 40:37.542
Right.

40:44.584 --> 40:45.834
Hi.

40:55.084 --> 40:56.417
Hi.

40:58.709 --> 41:00.001
There you go.

41:00.876 --> 41:04.251
These are from a car park on the square
and a side road.

41:06.917 --> 41:11.126
You'll go straight to heaven.
- Or straight to jail.

41:25.751 --> 41:30.209
Him. He's acting suspiciously.
- So are you.

41:30.917 --> 41:32.209
It's 1 o'clock at night.

41:33.709 --> 41:37.917
Look, you come out here.
- Yes, so I see. In great form.

41:38.792 --> 41:40.251
There, that's him.

41:41.042 --> 41:45.959
He looks around a bit and then leaves
in the same direction as you. Here.

41:46.126 --> 41:48.417
Did you notice that man in there?

41:55.917 --> 41:58.751
I'm going to circulate his photo.
- No, it's no one.

42:00.959 --> 42:02.334
What d'you mean, it's no one?

42:04.209 --> 42:05.667
So you know him?

42:08.167 --> 42:09.501
Is he a friend?

42:12.126 --> 42:13.334
An ex?

42:20.167 --> 42:21.917
Is he one of your patients?

42:23.084 --> 42:27.959
What is he being treated for?
Depression? Addiction? Tell me.

42:30.084 --> 42:31.626
Anxiety.

42:35.292 --> 42:37.001
He...

42:37.751 --> 42:43.001
He's good-looking, is very intelligent,
is from a wealthy family.

42:43.167 --> 42:44.834
He has everything going for him.

42:45.251 --> 42:49.751
But sometimes he becomes extremely anxious
and then he takes all kinds of things.

42:49.917 --> 42:54.834
And... that's why he's staying
at our clinic.

42:55.001 --> 42:58.167
And he's allowed out on the town
in the evening, just like that?

42:59.667 --> 43:03.876
The aim of the therapy is
to help people lead a normal life again,

43:04.042 --> 43:07.334
not lock them up for the rest of
their life, doing sudokus.

43:07.751 --> 43:09.668
What's his name?
- No.

43:09.834 --> 43:11.542
What's his name?
- No.

43:12.042 --> 43:16.584
Involving him in such a gruesome case
won't... won't do him any good at all.

43:16.751 --> 43:19.709
His anxiety is under control,
his medication sorted out.

43:19.876 --> 43:21.417
He was there that evening.
- Yes.

43:21.584 --> 43:26.376
He followed you. He may have been the one
who spiked your drink.

43:29.626 --> 43:33.501
Don't be stupid.
- Being concerned isn't stupid.

43:45.084 --> 43:49.751
Patrick is staying in one of
the patient rooms on the ground floor.

43:54.084 --> 43:55.459
Thanks.

45:48.834 --> 45:50.084
Where's Verstuyft?

45:50.251 --> 45:53.459
Um, he said something about
entering reports in the system.

45:53.626 --> 45:57.001
Chief, that Hoybergs... Eh?
You know, from those games.

45:57.167 --> 45:59.501
He gave us his diary, didn't he?
- Yes.

45:59.667 --> 46:03.459
It doesn't always tally with his alibis
and the locations of his mobile.

46:03.667 --> 46:06.417
Bring him in.
He can come and explain that here.

46:07.251 --> 46:10.792
We can't, he's at a gaming congress
in Stuttgart until tomorrow.

46:11.001 --> 46:14.876
He asked if he could go. The investigating
judge saw no reason to refuse.

46:17.542 --> 46:20.001
Do you do talking therapy on the couch?

46:20.167 --> 46:24.459
We don't talk all day, don't have
a petting farm and don't do group crafts.

46:24.834 --> 46:28.917
We investigate substances that
unbalance our patients, in our lab,

46:29.084 --> 46:31.584
and we sort out their medication.

46:32.334 --> 46:34.459
Patrick is in the swimming pool.

46:42.334 --> 46:46.667
Great. Alright? OK?

46:50.126 --> 46:54.959
Patrick? This is Freddy.
Freddy wants some information.

46:55.376 --> 46:59.459
Hello. Police Chief Verstuyft,
pleased to meet you.

46:59.626 --> 47:03.501
It's information about me.
It's nothing special. It's about me, OK?

47:03.667 --> 47:05.876
OK.
- OK, OK.

47:06.042 --> 47:08.542
I'll just go and take my wet things off.

47:12.584 --> 47:17.126
I've had to talk to you before about
the rules on how to behave with patients.

47:17.292 --> 47:21.251
You are too familiar. The rules are there
for your own protection.

47:21.417 --> 47:25.792
Sven has barricaded himself in a room and
I think he got pills from somewhere.

47:25.959 --> 47:30.042
I can't come now.
- You're the only one he listens to.

47:34.292 --> 47:36.625
I'll be right back.
- Oh, OK.

47:43.334 --> 47:45.584
So you make the guys sweat.

47:46.084 --> 47:49.501
What? No, I look after the swimming pool.

47:49.792 --> 47:53.334
I also do the golf and the gym.
- Sounds a bit like Club Med. Eh?

47:54.209 --> 47:57.001
Yes.
- What kind of people come here?

47:57.751 --> 48:04.042
All kinds. People with addictions, depression,
anxiety. All kinds of problems really.

48:04.209 --> 48:05.501
Except financial ones.

48:05.834 --> 48:12.042
Yes. Here it's mainly business people
and people from the media, politicians.

48:12.209 --> 48:15.542
How long has Patrick been here?
- Is he in trouble?

48:16.792 --> 48:18.876
Thanks. Right.

48:22.751 --> 48:26.876
He specializes in game design.
He has developed some violent games.

48:27.042 --> 48:30.501
Zombie, horror, that kind of thing.
Then he moved here.

48:30.667 --> 48:34.292
And for someone in IT,
he's not very active on social media.

48:34.459 --> 48:38.376
He doesn't have Facebook or Twitter.
There's very little to be found about him.

48:38.542 --> 48:41.459
His number of hospital admissions
is striking.

48:42.792 --> 48:47.167
Were you at the Roxy Saturday evening?
- Yes, I was there.

48:50.042 --> 48:54.834
I try to go there now and then.
On Rina's advice, in fact.

48:55.709 --> 48:59.209
I have to challenge myself,
mix with other people.

49:04.084 --> 49:06.584
Did she say she was going to be there
that evening too?

49:06.751 --> 49:10.459
No. I only spotted Rina when she left.

49:11.042 --> 49:14.001
She didn't reply and
was walking unsteadily.

49:15.334 --> 49:17.501
I was worried and I went after her.

49:17.667 --> 49:18.792
ZOERSEL LIBRARY

49:19.209 --> 49:23.042
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And... what was the problem?

49:26.126 --> 49:28.126
She'd already gone by the time I came out.

49:30.001 --> 49:32.751
No, I can't... I can't reach.

49:32.917 --> 49:34.251
This one. Oh?

49:35.001 --> 49:37.126
Here, this doesn't float anymore.

49:37.751 --> 49:39.959
Here, that's it.
That's the right one.

49:40.126 --> 49:41.584
Hi, Freddy.
- Is Vincke home?

49:41.751 --> 49:42.834
YES.

49:46.251 --> 49:48.001
Yes, good evening.

49:48.876 --> 49:51.168
Hi, Freddy.
- Eric...

49:52.042 --> 49:54.167
Rina needs protection.

49:55.542 --> 49:57.751
We can't justify that, Freddy.
We have...

49:57.917 --> 49:59.876
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

50:00.042 --> 50:03.834
One of her patients who was at
the same club the night she disappeared

50:04.001 --> 50:07.209
is also a member of the library
where one of the victims worked. So...

50:07.376 --> 50:09.251
We'll check that out.
- OK.

50:09.417 --> 50:11.751
But Hoybergs is our priority
at the moment.

50:11.917 --> 50:14.917
Picking up Hoybergs the moment
he enters the country.

50:15.084 --> 50:17.084
Hoybergs?
- Hoybergs, yes.

50:17.251 --> 50:21.126
If you'd done your job and not got
carried away with an attention seeker

50:21.292 --> 50:24.917
then you would've known.
- Why would Rina be seeking attention?

50:25.084 --> 50:29.126
I don't know. Maybe because
her book isn't selling so well. Perhaps.

50:29.292 --> 50:31.292
Is that his brilliant conclusion?

50:34.459 --> 50:38.209
Come on. Come on, Freddy, sit down.
There's some dessert left.

50:38.376 --> 50:42.751
Colleagues from Vice have checked her out.
Between studying pharmacology

50:42.917 --> 50:46.876
and psychiatric assistant training, she
was in a convalescent home for two years.

50:47.042 --> 50:49.292
Excuse me, I'll just...
- Yeah.

50:49.459 --> 50:51.167
But Freddy...

50:52.334 --> 50:56.042
I've also been drawn too far into
an attention seeker's story.

50:56.584 --> 50:59.709
But sooner or later
they all get caught up in...

50:59.876 --> 51:02.917
Go and have a fucking shit, pal,
just go and have a shit!

51:03.084 --> 51:04.501
You and your feeble theories.

51:04.667 --> 51:06.376
Eric.
- What?

51:18.001 --> 51:20.584
Rina, where are you?
- Freddy?

51:20.751 --> 51:23.542
Did you get my messages?
- No.

51:23.709 --> 51:27.542
Hello? Dammit, I can't hear you
very well. Can you go outside?

51:27.709 --> 51:31.876
What did you do to Patrick?
What did you do to Patrick?

51:32.042 --> 51:36.167
Nothing. I simply asked him
some questions. He was very calm.

51:36.334 --> 51:41.584
I thought you were different. Silly of me.
- Rina, Rina, I...

51:41.751 --> 51:43.417
Goddammit.

52:31.459 --> 52:33.334
There's something I have to tell you.

52:36.084 --> 52:37.834
I'm dancing.

53:19.751 --> 53:23.501
Cassiers, what was so urgent?

53:23.667 --> 53:27.126
I think I know why Hoybergs spent
so much time in hospitals. Here.

53:27.459 --> 53:32.292
That's from the local news section of
a national newspaper. May 1977.

53:32.459 --> 53:36.209
He may not be on social media
but his past is.

53:36.376 --> 53:38.542
Hoybergs was disabled.

54:11.001 --> 54:12.209
Rina?

54:13.084 --> 54:17.376
Rina, is everything OK?
- Yes. Where were you?

54:17.584 --> 54:20.542
Fuck it. There was someone downstairs.

54:21.834 --> 54:23.709
Let me see.
- I have to report it.

54:23.876 --> 54:28.667
My phone's broken. May I borrow yours?
- Calm down. Sit down a moment.

54:38.209 --> 54:40.376
You're going to have a scar.
- Yeah.

54:42.167 --> 54:45.334
Shame you won't be able to see it
with all your hair.

54:46.001 --> 54:47.292
A scar...

54:49.084 --> 54:50.334
on a man, that's...

54:51.959 --> 54:53.501
that's sexy.

55:51.042 --> 55:53.501
I can get suspended for this.

55:54.376 --> 55:56.542
Only if I tell someone.

57:35.251 --> 57:36.876
Look at me.

57:40.626 --> 57:42.084
Don't you dare come.

58:30.792 --> 58:34.667
Eleven back operations.
Four in Germany, five in Switzerland

58:34.834 --> 58:38.417
and two wear-and-tear ones here.

58:38.584 --> 58:42.667
Eleven operations.
- A back is corrected gradually.

58:42.834 --> 58:45.917
Followed by painful rehabilitation
each time.

58:46.334 --> 58:49.126
Has it had any effect psychologically?

58:49.292 --> 58:50.626
He...

58:52.084 --> 58:54.167
The pain can sometimes overwhelm him.

58:54.334 --> 58:59.251
At times he stills sees himself
as a sort of hunchback

59:00.001 --> 59:03.751
and thinks everyone is staring at him
and reacts very defensively.

59:03.959 --> 59:06.917
Defensively or aggressively?

59:07.209 --> 59:11.751
Medication has kept that under control
for a number of years now.

59:11.917 --> 59:16.626
But the painkillers,
that's a different matter.

59:18.084 --> 59:22.126
I know he's been hospitalised in
a private clinic a few times for that.

59:22.459 --> 59:27.334
Is that that rehab centre's site?
- They must've really helped Hoybergs.

59:27.501 --> 59:29.834
He made a serious donation.
He paid for a gym.

59:30.001 --> 59:32.376
Then we'll have to go and
have a chat with them.

59:32.542 --> 59:35.209
Sorry, hold on.
Go back to the previous photo.

59:36.501 --> 59:38.251
May I? Sorry.

59:40.501 --> 59:45.459
Oh. He knows Rina.
- He knows his victims.

59:45.626 --> 59:47.084
Freddy was right, dammit.

01:00:12.084 --> 01:00:13.334
Hi.

01:00:15.167 --> 01:00:17.084
Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:20.876 --> 01:00:24.667
Patrick repaired my espresso machine.
- Oh.

01:00:26.917 --> 01:00:30.751
Not with a hammer, I hope?
This was in the bathroom.

01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:35.709
Patrick can't control his anxiety
if he hasn't hidden a hammer somewhere.

01:00:37.126 --> 01:00:42.459
It's like a cuddly toy for a child.
Gives the illusion of safety.

01:00:44.126 --> 01:00:46.584
When was he here?
- Yesterday.

01:00:47.959 --> 01:00:50.792
You don't think
he was the one prowling around here?

01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:55.084
Why would he prowl around here?

01:00:56.292 --> 01:00:59.959
He only needs to ring the bell
and I'll open the door. Always.

01:01:00.959 --> 01:01:02.792
I do to all my patients.

01:01:05.126 --> 01:01:07.417
How well do you know Patrick?

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:13.751
Are you expecting someone?
- No.

01:01:32.667 --> 01:01:35.417
Oh. Vincke.

01:01:36.209 --> 01:01:38.751
Yeah, I... I spent the night here

01:01:38.917 --> 01:01:41.584
because I saw someone
prowling around here last night

01:01:41.751 --> 01:01:46.334
so I thought it best to...
to stay here.

01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:50.292
They attacked me. Hit me, here.
Hit me on the head.

01:01:50.459 --> 01:01:54.459
But I haven't been able to report it yet
because my phone is broken.

01:01:55.292 --> 01:02:01.042
I'll write my report right away,
I promise, I just wanted to have a shower.

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:03.126
Guys.

01:02:11.126 --> 01:02:12.501
Good morning.

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:17.042
There have been some new developments.
You're getting protection.

01:02:17.209 --> 01:02:18.584
Thank you.

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:36.542
Do you recognise this man?

01:02:48.501 --> 01:02:50.209
There you are.

01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:58.792
Maybe this will jog your memory.

01:03:04.959 --> 01:03:09.251
That photo was taken at the rehab centre
in Valkenburg, where I did a placement.

01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:14.292
The opening of the gym.
I saw him there, he was a patient.

01:03:14.459 --> 01:03:18.626
Rina said at the beginning that one of
the photos seemed vaguely familiar.

01:03:27.709 --> 01:03:28.959
Eric.

01:03:30.334 --> 01:03:34.001
Eric. Hold on.
- Go ahead.

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:39.834
You slept with her.
- I slept in her apartment.

01:03:40.001 --> 01:03:42.501
Yeah, yeah. I'm not an imbecile.
I'm not.

01:03:42.667 --> 01:03:45.709
Are you stupid? Sleeping with
someone involved in the case.

01:03:45.876 --> 01:03:48.167
Oh, now she's suddenly
involved in the case.

01:03:48.334 --> 01:03:53.126
Indecent assault, abuse of
your position, breach of trust.

01:03:53.292 --> 01:03:56.584
She can get them to throw the book at you.
Get you in serious trouble.

01:03:56.751 --> 01:03:59.709
Rina won't do that.
- No, because she's really stable, eh?

01:03:59.876 --> 01:04:02.584
There aren't any witnesses.
- No? What about me?

01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:05.751
And those two saw you half-naked too.
I have to report it.

01:04:05.917 --> 01:04:08.042
What?
- Report it. I'm obliged to report it

01:04:08.209 --> 01:04:10.542
or she can report us all.
- I just said that Ri...

01:04:10.709 --> 01:04:15.709
I'm sick to death of it. You do it by the
book. That's how you like doing it anyway.

01:04:15.876 --> 01:04:17.167
Stay far away from her,

01:04:17.334 --> 01:04:21.376
don't stray even a millimetre from
the tasks I or Mulder give you.

01:04:21.542 --> 01:04:22.709
Go and write that report.

01:04:22.876 --> 01:04:26.709
Include everything that happened yesterday
and what you know about Rina.

01:04:26.876 --> 01:04:31.584
From now on focus on Hoybergs.
And you're staying in the office.

01:04:31.751 --> 01:04:34.251
D'you hear me? In the office.
Yes?

01:04:45.334 --> 01:04:49.209
Yes, that's Véronique's...

01:04:53.626 --> 01:04:56.834
As soon as there is any more news,
we'll contact you.

01:05:15.792 --> 01:05:20.834
Maybe we shouldn't think the worst.
- No, of course not. Let's stay positive.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.792
Maybe she just spent the night
with some cop. Eh?

01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:43.334
Federal Police. Where is she?

01:05:44.126 --> 01:05:45.751
Who?
- Hands to the front.

01:05:45.917 --> 01:05:48.709
Where is who?
- Where is she?

01:05:48.876 --> 01:05:50.459
Who?
- Hands to the front.

01:05:50.626 --> 01:05:53.459
Could you be more specific?
- Where is she?

01:05:57.417 --> 01:05:58.876
Take him in.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.917
If she's still alive, then tell us.

01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:17.209
I don't know what you want from me
but I don't know those people.

01:06:17.667 --> 01:06:19.584
Don't let her die.

01:06:21.334 --> 01:06:25.667
If you help us save her, that will be
to your advantage during your trial.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:30.584
You can be here
but all you're allowed to do is breathe.

01:06:33.209 --> 01:06:37.667
Why was your phone turned off?
So we couldn't trace you?

01:06:37.834 --> 01:06:42.334
It's a games fair, my phone's always
turned off during demos. It's polite.

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:43.876
Yeah.

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:48.751
We checked your hotel. You didn't appear
for breakfast this morning. Not hungry?

01:06:49.459 --> 01:06:52.834
I rarely have breakfast.
- Yeah, of course.

01:06:54.459 --> 01:06:59.292
The diaries you gave us
don't tally with the reality.

01:06:59.459 --> 01:07:03.251
My diaries are never correct.
There are always last-minute changes.

01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:06.876
I don't think Mr Hoybergs realises
how tight the noose around his neck is.

01:07:07.042 --> 01:07:10.834
Similar gruesome events happened in
the Cologne area when you lived there.

01:07:11.001 --> 01:07:14.292
You're in a photo with one of the victims.

01:07:14.459 --> 01:07:17.001
I'm in thousands of photos
with thousands of people.

01:07:17.167 --> 01:07:21.542
Rubbish. You are in very few photos.

01:07:22.751 --> 01:07:25.792
Maybe that's why you've stayed
under the radar for so long.

01:07:29.709 --> 01:07:35.834
Where is she? Come on, redeem yourself.
Tell us she's still alive.

01:07:36.001 --> 01:07:39.292
Think about her parents,
what they are going through.

01:07:39.459 --> 01:07:41.959
You've got children too, eh?
- Yes. Stop this.

01:07:42.126 --> 01:07:45.292
I haven't done anything.
Not here, not in Cologne, nowhere.

01:07:45.459 --> 01:07:50.709
In Cologne I worked with my colleague
day and night, all day, every day.

01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:54.167
He can confirm that.
- What's this colleague's name?

01:07:54.334 --> 01:07:59.667
Menken. Andreas Menken.
- OK. Now be very careful what you say.

01:07:59.834 --> 01:08:03.251
I shall send people to Germany
to check every word with Menken.

01:08:03.459 --> 01:08:06.792
You can save yourself the expense.
Menken lives in Brussels.

01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:10.626
He travelled back and forth for a few
weeks at a time and slept in our office.

01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:13.876
He went back and forth? You said
he was with you all day every day.

01:08:14.042 --> 01:08:19.542
Menken was in Germany then and
now he's here. He's not on our list.

01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:44.376
CARETAKER

01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:53.292
Mr Menken? Police.

01:08:53.459 --> 01:08:57.751
It's no use, sir.
I haven't seen him for a few days.

01:08:57.917 --> 01:09:00.501
I think he's got a girl somewhere.

01:09:00.667 --> 01:09:04.751
Do you sometimes see him here with women?
- No. Why?

01:09:06.167 --> 01:09:10.584
Is he wanted for something with women?
- We just want to talk to him.

01:09:12.542 --> 01:09:15.459
Not for those women with no head, eh?

01:09:16.126 --> 01:09:19.626
I don't believe this. Really?
I've got a master key.

01:09:19.959 --> 01:09:24.751
No, no, no, Mr Lemmens, thank you.
- Oh, I suppose it's not legal?

01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:30.501
I never do it, of course.
I swear on my grandmother's grave!

01:09:33.292 --> 01:09:34.959
Search warrant?

01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:39.709
No, Cassiers, you're right. We haven't
got enough for a search warrant.

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:41.334
Listen.

01:09:41.792 --> 01:09:45.751
Let Roth stay and watch that building.
You come back

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:49.376
and try to get as much information
as you can from your German colleagues

01:09:49.542 --> 01:09:53.084
about this Menken
OK. Right, I've got to go now.

01:09:57.167 --> 01:09:59.501
What do you want me to
tell you about Menken?

01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:03.417
He's a loner, a game designer,
a bit of a nerd.

01:10:03.584 --> 01:10:06.584
Like most of them.
Parents are divorced.

01:10:06.751 --> 01:10:11.376
When the company asked me to set up
a branch here, I brought him with me.

01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:15.626
Is he in a permanent relationship?
- Not that I know of.

01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:19.126
I don't see much of him.
At the gun club now and then.

01:10:19.459 --> 01:10:23.042
Pistol shooting. Army sons.

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.876
Is there anyone at work he is close to?

01:10:27.042 --> 01:10:30.001
Menken usually works from home
because it's quiet there.

01:10:30.167 --> 01:10:34.042
Now and then he rents something abroad
to be able to work in peace there.

01:10:34.209 --> 01:10:37.667
Then his phone is turned off too. Artists.

01:10:37.834 --> 01:10:39.126
Hi.

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:44.584
What are you doing here?
Weren't you guarding Rina?

01:10:44.751 --> 01:10:46.584
Yeah, and then it was called off.

01:10:46.751 --> 01:10:51.084
When Hoybergs was picked up.
- Fuck.

01:10:51.251 --> 01:10:53.292
What if it isn't Hoybergs?

01:11:02.917 --> 01:11:04.292
Rina?

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:12.917
Rina?

01:11:18.126 --> 01:11:19.709
Rina?

01:11:23.959 --> 01:11:26.417
Rina, watch out. Who's that?

01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:29.542
It's Freddy. Look.
- Watch out, Rina.

01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:31.167
It's Freddy.
- Watch out.

01:11:31.334 --> 01:11:32.751
It's Freddy.

01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:38.334
Patrick, it's me. Remember me?
- Freddy is a friend. Freddy is a friend.

01:11:38.501 --> 01:11:42.084
He's not a friend. His eyes...
- Don't you remember me?

01:11:42.251 --> 01:11:43.417
His eyes.
- Freddy.

01:11:43.584 --> 01:11:47.001
Freddy is a friend.
- He's not a friend.

01:11:49.834 --> 01:11:52.876
He's stopped taking his pills
and that's your fault.

01:11:54.126 --> 01:11:57.126
You have to take your pills, Patrick.
- Those aren't my pills.

01:11:58.292 --> 01:11:59.751
They're poison.

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:11.084
I'll call the emergency services.
- No. No, no, no.

01:12:12.459 --> 01:12:16.251
Patrick, Patrick, Patrick, Patrick.

01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:22.376
Freddy likes us.
- He likes you. He wants to take you away.

01:12:22.542 --> 01:12:25.251
No one's going anywhere.
- You want to take her away, eh?

01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:27.959
No one's going anywhere.

01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:30.709
Come on.

01:12:32.042 --> 01:12:33.459
Give me your hand.

01:12:36.209 --> 01:12:39.459
OK. Stroke him.

01:12:41.667 --> 01:12:44.584
OK. OK.

01:12:48.542 --> 01:12:50.834
OK. That's it.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:00.459
Rina?

01:13:07.126 --> 01:13:10.459
When he wakes up
he'll have forgotten everything.

01:13:18.667 --> 01:13:20.542
You can't stay here.

01:13:21.167 --> 01:13:23.292
They're no longer sure it's Hoybergs.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:28.417
I can stay at the clinic.
There's always someone there.

01:13:29.084 --> 01:13:34.001
Help me. We'll put him in the car.
- You have to stop this.

01:13:35.251 --> 01:13:37.709
Take his feet.
- He's too dependent on you.

01:13:37.876 --> 01:13:41.334
Him coming to your home
isn't healthy, is it?

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:43.167
Take his feet.

01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:52.376
Eric, an enormous red flashing light.
A fire.

01:13:52.542 --> 01:13:57.584
Menken's mother died in Germany in a fire.
When Menken was fifteen.

01:13:57.751 --> 01:14:01.959
Most killers start with arson.
Arson and cruelty to animals, eh?

01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:05.917
Is Menken's name mentioned in the case?
- No proof it was started on purpose.

01:14:06.084 --> 01:14:09.876
But there was an investigation.
- Menken wasn't home that weekend.

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:12.834
He was supposed to be at boarding school
but wasn't.

01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:17.501
Wait till you see his alibi.
Alice Neumann, Menken's mum's best friend.

01:14:17.667 --> 01:14:20.417
Until mum caught her best friend
with her son.

01:14:20.584 --> 01:14:25.542
This Alice was 36, Menken just 15.
His mother almost tore her to shreds.

01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:29.042
But Menken and Alice carried on
seeing each other in secret

01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:33.376
and she stated he was with her
the weekend of the fire.

01:14:33.542 --> 01:14:36.167
So she was his alibi.
- The best is still to come.

01:14:36.334 --> 01:14:39.709
Alice Neumann committed suicide
a few years later.

01:14:39.876 --> 01:14:43.709
Laid her head on a railway track.
- Eric, pal, this is textbook stuff.

01:14:43.876 --> 01:14:46.542
Loveless childhood
at boarding school, isolated,

01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:49.334
sexual transgression,
re-enacting the decapitation.

01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:52.334
Mum was probably his first victim.
And he got away with it.

01:14:52.501 --> 01:14:54.126
There. Menken is our man.

01:15:08.042 --> 01:15:12.084
I've never been in this Menken's place.
Never.

01:15:12.959 --> 01:15:15.501
Damn.
- That was to be expected. Danny?

01:15:29.917 --> 01:15:31.251
Police.

01:16:14.417 --> 01:16:15.751
Eric.

01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:38.917
Come with me.

01:17:15.959 --> 01:17:17.501
What's up?

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:19.667
Uh? What's going on?

01:17:19.834 --> 01:17:22.459
Goddammit, it's deleting all the files.

01:17:22.626 --> 01:17:25.959
Shit.
- Goddammit. Close it. Close it.

01:17:26.126 --> 01:17:27.376
Fuck.

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:29.959
Goddammit.
- Shit.

01:17:31.001 --> 01:17:35.834
Shit, I pulled the plug out but
it's carrying on. There must be a battery.

01:17:46.626 --> 01:17:51.084
That's all they could save. It's the first
level in the game he was developing.

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:55.709
His description has been circulated
but we haven't released his name yet.

01:17:55.876 --> 01:17:58.417
We don't want him to panic.

01:17:58.584 --> 01:18:01.209
No. Or Véronique Stassyns stands
no chance.

01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:05.126
No, no, we're going out via a side exit.
- The press is out front.

01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:09.001
Scared of the press? Hm?
- Our people will take you home.

01:18:09.209 --> 01:18:12.209
Not necessary. My lawyer will take me.
His meter is running.

01:18:12.376 --> 01:18:13.834
Our apologies, of course.

01:18:14.042 --> 01:18:18.334
My lawyer will put a figure on
your apologies on the way home.

01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:22.167
Chief?
Here, a national newspaper's website.

01:18:22.334 --> 01:18:23.792
IS THIS THE HUNTED HEADHUNTER?

01:18:23.959 --> 01:18:26.542
Dammit.
- Now he will go into hiding.

01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:29.126
Which idiot leaked his name to the press?

01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:32.292
Right...

01:18:32.459 --> 01:18:34.542
I don't believe it!
- Shit.

01:19:08.417 --> 01:19:12.751
No, no trace of Véronique or anyone else
being held in that apartment.

01:19:13.084 --> 01:19:16.209
Or Menken is an obsessive cleaner.
That's possible too.

01:19:16.376 --> 01:19:21.751
He has somewhere else. You won't get
a woman past that caretaker unnoticed.

01:19:21.917 --> 01:19:26.709
Urgent call over the radio from
one of the teams. Suspicious movement.

01:19:26.876 --> 01:19:28.459
Menken?
- No, Cody.

01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:31.376
Cody?
- Cody stopped by a young woman.

01:19:31.542 --> 01:19:34.001
We're keeping our distance
and watching him.

01:19:34.167 --> 01:19:39.751
Hey, Mulder is from Europol. Europol isn't
allowed to take part in interventions.

01:19:39.917 --> 01:19:41.417
Sorry, Mulder.

01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:45.501
Hey, you have to stay in the office.
- What?

01:19:45.667 --> 01:19:46.792
In the office.

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:54.626
Goddammit.

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:58.167
Sweet?

01:20:06.042 --> 01:20:07.417
He has picked her up.

01:20:07.584 --> 01:20:10.459
The hen is with the rooster.
- Yep.

01:20:10.626 --> 01:20:13.126
They are driving north,
towards Esmoreitlaan.

01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:17.292
Locate and wait. And no going it alone
unless the woman is in danger.

01:20:17.584 --> 01:20:19.959
And be careful, guys.
He has a gun permit.

01:20:20.626 --> 01:20:23.084
We're heading for the river,
for the river.

01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:28.917
Not too close, Benji. Benji, not
too close. And turn your lights off.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:40.876
I don't believe it.

01:20:41.792 --> 01:20:44.584
Where has he gone?
- I don't believe this.

01:20:44.751 --> 01:20:46.834
Where is he?
- Shit.

01:20:49.626 --> 01:20:50.959
Yes. There.

01:21:01.084 --> 01:21:02.501
What's up?

01:21:03.584 --> 01:21:05.792
Can't hear him now.
- Don't tell me you lost him.

01:21:05.959 --> 01:21:10.084
He turned in here somewhere.
- He can't be far. The engine's off.

01:21:12.542 --> 01:21:15.334
OK, split up and when you see him,
tell the rest right away.

01:21:15.584 --> 01:21:17.084
OK. I go left.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:06.459
The car is 200 metres along, past the fork
in the road, on the right, by an oak tree.

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:38.959
Leave him alone.
- Calm down, calm down.

01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:44.751
What's happened?
- Nothing. He hasn't done anything.

01:22:44.917 --> 01:22:48.001
That's the point.
He was going to tell his wife.

01:22:51.126 --> 01:22:55.459
But no, a quick fumble in the woods.
You bastard. That's all I'm good for, eh?

01:23:24.959 --> 01:23:26.626
GERMANY

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:52.001
I hear you're looking for me.

01:24:02.834 --> 01:24:05.042
Has he said where Véronique is?

01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:13.209
It's not him.
- Oh.

01:24:14.459 --> 01:24:16.626
No, it's not him, Vincke.

01:24:16.792 --> 01:24:20.334
And you established that in half an hour.

01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:25.334
All his profiling. His past, his running
away. Everything we found at his place.

01:24:25.501 --> 01:24:27.292
All out the window?
- Yes.

01:24:27.459 --> 01:24:31.417
Why isn't it him?
- Because I believe him.

01:24:31.584 --> 01:24:33.584
OK, OK. You believe him.

01:24:33.876 --> 01:24:36.542
He's been in a monastery in France
for 2 weeks.

01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:39.501
He regularly goes there
so he can work uninterrupted,

01:24:39.667 --> 01:24:43.417
no phone, no internet,
no cable TV, nothing.

01:24:44.001 --> 01:24:47.584
He came back cos someone who'd just
arrived had seen his photo in the paper.

01:24:47.751 --> 01:24:51.501
I don't believe it.
There must be another explanation?

01:24:52.084 --> 01:24:54.542
Someone is on their way to the monastery

01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:58.251
but you'll see, I'm almost certain
the monks will confirm his alibi.

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:05.042
He thinks his boss dropped him in it.
- Hoybergs?

01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:09.792
He knew where he was. The whole time.
- Why didn't he say anything?

01:25:11.292 --> 01:25:15.959
There's only one thing to do, take a very
close look at Hoybergs, from scratch.

01:25:16.126 --> 01:25:17.251
Yeah.

01:25:18.292 --> 01:25:23.126
But without me, I have to go and put
some clean underpants on

01:25:23.292 --> 01:25:26.709
for my appointment with the investigating
judge at half past eight.

01:25:26.876 --> 01:25:30.334
I have to go and explain
where and who I slept with.

01:25:32.334 --> 01:25:33.709
Thank you.

01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:18.334
Good morning. Freddy Verstuyft.

01:26:18.501 --> 01:26:22.501
I've come to see the investigating judge,
at his invitation.

01:26:23.917 --> 01:26:26.709
OK. May I have your ID card?
- Of course. Here you are.

01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:30.667
You can stay there. I'll come and get you.
- OK, thank you.

01:26:36.334 --> 01:26:37.584
Rina.

01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:42.084
Suzanne?
Why are you calling with Rina's...?

01:27:06.334 --> 01:27:07.917
Are you OK?

01:27:14.251 --> 01:27:16.084
Fucking hell.

01:27:29.626 --> 01:27:30.834
Rina.

01:27:32.834 --> 01:27:34.542
Rina, goddammit, say something.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:39.126
I think it happened last night, I was here
with the water aerobics group...

01:27:39.292 --> 01:27:40.751
Where's Patrick?
- He...

01:27:40.917 --> 01:27:43.501
Where is he?
- He's in sleep therapy.

01:27:43.667 --> 01:27:46.084
Good thing he wasn't here.
He'd have freaked out.

01:27:46.501 --> 01:27:49.209
Out the way. Move, move.

01:27:49.376 --> 01:27:52.459
Fucking hell. Did anyone see anything.
Are there any witnesses?

01:27:52.626 --> 01:27:54.834
You can find that out, Cassiers.
We're off.

01:27:55.001 --> 01:27:56.626
You weren't allowed near her.

01:27:56.792 --> 01:28:00.459
But that animal is? Eh?
- Freddy, leave her here.

01:28:02.376 --> 01:28:03.376
She's not safe here.

01:28:03.417 --> 01:28:06.042
She is safe here.
And we have to take her statement.

01:28:20.167 --> 01:28:22.417
My uncle hasn't been here for years now.

01:28:32.334 --> 01:28:33.834
Come in.

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:38.001
Take a seat.

01:28:45.001 --> 01:28:47.792
So you don't think it's that Menken.

01:28:48.626 --> 01:28:51.667
Menken thinks his boss dropped him in it.

01:28:51.834 --> 01:28:54.834
So now Hoybergs is
the favourite suspect again.

01:29:06.626 --> 01:29:11.417
I really do have to go back and see the
investigating judge. Sorry, but I have to.

01:29:11.584 --> 01:29:13.876
It won't take long.

01:29:16.334 --> 01:29:19.167
You're safe here. Alright?

01:29:21.001 --> 01:29:24.542
OK.
- OK.

01:29:25.334 --> 01:29:28.501
I've already said.
He got a call last night.

01:29:28.667 --> 01:29:30.626
Did you hear that call yourself?

01:29:31.126 --> 01:29:35.709
If my husband said he got a call, he got
a call. He had to go out for a while.

01:29:35.876 --> 01:29:38.126
Do you know who called him?
- No.

01:29:39.376 --> 01:29:43.292
He didn't say anything about that either?
- No, he was upset.

01:29:43.459 --> 01:29:47.667
Maybe it was Menken.
- Have you had any contact with him since?

01:29:47.834 --> 01:29:51.001
He turns his phone off
when he goes to meetings.

01:29:52.376 --> 01:29:56.084
OK. We'll circulate his picture.

01:29:57.542 --> 01:29:59.251
Mrs Hoybergs.

01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:03.376
The investigating judge has
just left the building.

01:30:03.542 --> 01:30:06.917
I must say, he wasn't in a very good mood.

01:30:07.084 --> 01:30:13.709
Right, you have to come back,
without fail, tomorrow at... 8.30 a.m.

01:30:13.876 --> 01:30:15.251
OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:30:31.001 --> 01:30:34.917
I caught something too.
From the fridge in the night store.

01:30:36.584 --> 01:30:39.834
I found something else
among your uncle's fishing gear.

01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:05.501
What? Are you going to arrest me?

01:31:07.292 --> 01:31:08.751
Maybe.

01:31:17.667 --> 01:31:20.584
It's pure. It's from my pharmacy.

01:31:21.917 --> 01:31:23.501
I'm not going to take that.

01:31:23.667 --> 01:31:27.417
It's no fun if one person takes it
and the other doesn't.

01:31:28.251 --> 01:31:30.459
In it together.

01:33:22.751 --> 01:33:27.459
Goddammit, the investigating judge.
Fuck. Fuck. Shit.

01:33:34.459 --> 01:33:36.167
Cassiers.

01:33:38.542 --> 01:33:39.792
What?

01:34:47.834 --> 01:34:52.126
IT'S OVER. HOYBERGS FOUND WITH
LATEST VICTIM. SEE YOU LATER?

01:34:57.876 --> 01:35:00.417
MAYBE

01:35:03.209 --> 01:35:07.167
I can't decide, Freddy. is walking out
on the investigating judge twice

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:11.459
the stupidest thing you've ever done or
is it your affair with Rina?

01:35:11.626 --> 01:35:16.084
Mulder thinks the latter. But he doesn't
know our public prosecutors.

01:35:16.251 --> 01:35:18.626
Personally I'd say
the investigating judge.

01:35:19.501 --> 01:35:22.459
Yeah. That's why I'm here.

01:35:24.376 --> 01:35:26.126
The case is solved now

01:35:26.292 --> 01:35:30.667
so I thought maybe you could put in
a good word for me with the judge.

01:35:30.876 --> 01:35:32.709
Beyers, can you go with him?

01:35:33.334 --> 01:35:38.542
Make sure Chief Inspector Verstuyft goes
straight to the investigating judge.

01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:41.584
You only have yourself to blame.
So you can sort it out.

01:35:59.209 --> 01:36:00.459
Mulder?

01:36:04.876 --> 01:36:08.334
I'm finished, Eric. I'm finished.

01:36:09.917 --> 01:36:14.792
I...
- We ask a lot of you but have no choice.

01:36:14.959 --> 01:36:16.376
And you have the talent.

01:36:17.834 --> 01:36:20.709
It's gone. Went years ago. It...

01:36:21.917 --> 01:36:24.001
Maybe it was never there.

01:36:25.959 --> 01:36:27.584
Of course it was.

01:36:28.667 --> 01:36:31.084
I'm going to do something else
with my life, Eric.

01:36:40.376 --> 01:36:41.834
It's over.

01:36:45.126 --> 01:36:48.417
Patrick, I have to let you go.
- No.

01:36:48.584 --> 01:36:49.751
Yes.
- No.

01:36:49.917 --> 01:36:51.626
Yes.
- No.

01:36:52.209 --> 01:36:53.417
Patrick...

01:36:55.126 --> 01:36:56.584
do you understand?

01:37:00.792 --> 01:37:03.167
Oh. ls everything OK?

01:37:06.626 --> 01:37:08.376
Hey, Patrick.

01:37:09.959 --> 01:37:11.334
What's the matter?

01:37:13.334 --> 01:37:16.959
What's the matter? I'm here for you.

01:37:17.667 --> 01:37:20.042
Suzy, not now.

01:37:34.667 --> 01:37:39.292
Rina here, you know
what you have to do, after the beep.

01:37:42.376 --> 01:37:46.584
Sorry, Freddy, the investigating judge
thinks you should wait 24 hours too.

01:38:01.251 --> 01:38:03.501
So Hoybergs fired the gun like this?

01:38:04.084 --> 01:38:07.876
Yes, but then there should be
more blood on the sleeve.

01:38:08.584 --> 01:38:10.126
Here, look.

01:38:11.376 --> 01:38:13.292
Traces of blood everywhere.

01:38:13.959 --> 01:38:17.209
But not here. See?
- So?

01:38:20.959 --> 01:38:23.584
May I? Yeah?
- Yes.

01:38:27.376 --> 01:38:30.834
Only this can explain
the lack of blood on that sleeve.

01:38:32.959 --> 01:38:35.292
So someone held his hand?

01:38:38.542 --> 01:38:42.876
The hair dye. Identical to
the sample brought in earlier.

01:38:43.042 --> 01:38:44.334
From Rina Van Lierde?
- Yes.

01:38:44.501 --> 01:38:49.001
And the cause of death?
- In the case of the three I've examined,

01:38:49.167 --> 01:38:53.792
trauma caused by a blunt object,
a different murder weapon each time.

01:38:53.959 --> 01:38:58.209
But almost certainly a hammer each time.

01:39:08.167 --> 01:39:10.751
HAMMER

01:39:10.917 --> 01:39:14.042
Reminds me of Freddy.
- Which Freddy?

01:39:14.834 --> 01:39:18.751
Which Freddy? Freddy Verstuyft.
- No one called Freddy works here.

01:39:20.251 --> 01:39:24.584
I get it. Freddy, who no longer
works here, sent me an email

01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:29.209
about one Patrick Manteau.
And called him the man with the hammer.

01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:37.042
Here, and I replied:
Who is Patrick Manteau?

01:39:37.376 --> 01:39:38.626
And he...

01:39:38.792 --> 01:39:39.876
THE MAN WITH THE HAMMER

01:39:40.042 --> 01:39:43.834
Was that Patrick there?
At that rehab centre?

01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:49.626
You said we had to ignore
orders from Verstuyft.

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.626
So you didn't check it?

01:39:54.626 --> 01:39:58.084
He wasn't there. But I did dig deeper.

01:39:58.251 --> 01:40:01.751
And Patrick Manteau was at
a semi-open hospital in Limburg.

01:40:01.917 --> 01:40:04.917
Right by the German border and
only 25 km from Wahner Heide.

01:40:05.084 --> 01:40:08.626
At the time when those women disappeared?
- I'm checking that now.

01:40:08.792 --> 01:40:13.417
On one of the evenings he was stopped
by traffic police for reckless driving.

01:40:13.584 --> 01:40:17.501
He tested positive for cocaine and
his passenger took over the driving.

01:40:17.667 --> 01:40:21.042
A woman?
- It doesn't say.

01:40:21.209 --> 01:40:25.501
But it was 6 km from the spot where one of
those women disappeared that evening.

01:40:34.417 --> 01:40:37.626
And when I tell you
to ignore Verstuyft's orders, Cassiers,

01:40:37.792 --> 01:40:40.584
I mean ignore Verstuyft's orders.
- Yeah...

01:40:41.167 --> 01:40:43.001
But well done.

01:40:53.251 --> 01:40:54.584
Open the door.

01:41:22.626 --> 01:41:26.209
The big Verstuyft.
When it comes to his mouth anyway.

01:41:26.376 --> 01:41:30.876
I would've paid to put you in handcuffs.
And now look.

01:41:31.792 --> 01:41:35.001
Maybe it's a good moment
to buy a lottery ticket too.

01:41:35.167 --> 01:41:38.584
That'd be great.
Then you can retire, eh?

01:41:38.751 --> 01:41:42.626
A disaster for your local bar but
a blessing for the police and society.

01:41:42.792 --> 01:41:44.376
Freddy.

01:41:44.542 --> 01:41:48.792
Sorry, Chief, we can't keep
the investigating judge waiting.

01:41:48.959 --> 01:41:52.126
That suicide was staged.
- What did you say?

01:41:52.334 --> 01:41:55.542
And we have good reason to think
it was that Patrick Manteau.

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:58.917
Fuck, I knew it.
You should've listened to me.

01:41:59.084 --> 01:42:01.751
We now think the guy has got Rina.

01:42:02.126 --> 01:42:05.584
No, no, no. He can't have.
- We don't know where she is, Freddy.

01:42:05.751 --> 01:42:09.292
She's not at home, not at her work.
Nowhere.

01:42:10.042 --> 01:42:11.626
Where can she be, Freddy?

01:42:13.584 --> 01:42:17.959
We found her colleague, Suzanne,
dead in his room.

01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:21.834
Where can Rina be, Freddy?

01:42:22.417 --> 01:42:23.917
Where?

01:43:03.334 --> 01:43:07.917
Four texts to Verstuyft and
her last two calls are to Patrick.

01:43:08.084 --> 01:43:11.459
Is his picture being circulated?
- We need to redo the perpetrator profile.

01:43:11.626 --> 01:43:15.917
No, I've had enough of perpetrator
profiles. Now I just want a perpetrator.

01:43:16.084 --> 01:43:17.584
A perpetrator!

01:43:33.917 --> 01:43:37.001
Patrick, I have to let you go.

01:43:37.626 --> 01:43:38.709
It's over.

01:43:42.084 --> 01:43:44.626
Patrick. Patrick.

01:44:03.042 --> 01:44:05.959
I wanted to reassure you
but we haven't got him. You're not safe.

01:44:06.167 --> 01:44:10.167
I'll try again later. I have to go and
see the investigating judge in a moment.

01:44:10.334 --> 01:44:15.376
Vincke has been petty and
reported me for... for us...

01:44:18.917 --> 01:44:20.626
Think of me.

01:44:22.459 --> 01:44:25.709
Look at the older voicemails. Here.
- Yeah.

01:44:26.417 --> 01:44:29.459
Here, 17 seconds. That's from Patrick.
- Yes.

01:44:29.626 --> 01:44:32.209
Rina. I want to see you.

01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:34.209
Where are you?

01:44:35.251 --> 01:44:36.667
Rina?

01:44:37.459 --> 01:44:40.417
Rina, I'm already there.

01:44:41.834 --> 01:44:45.001
That's the carillon.
He's near the cathedral.

01:45:23.834 --> 01:45:25.084
In Moriaanstraat.
- Car?

01:45:25.251 --> 01:45:29.084
On foot is faster. Ask for intervention.
No sirens, we don't want to scare him off.

01:45:29.251 --> 01:45:30.459
OK.

01:45:31.167 --> 01:45:32.542
Team Bravo to all channels.

01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:36.542
SWAT intervention requested
in Moriaanstraat, number 26.

01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:40.209
Suspect is Patrick Manteau.
May be armed.

01:45:40.376 --> 01:45:42.917
May be holding a woman hostage.

01:45:50.667 --> 01:45:52.834
Goddammit, Verstuyft.

01:45:58.459 --> 01:46:01.501
Car back. If he's here
we don't want him to panic.

01:46:01.667 --> 01:46:04.001
What about Rina?
- Cars back. Set up a perimeter.

01:46:04.209 --> 01:46:06.709
No one goes in.
We wait here for an intervention team.

01:46:16.542 --> 01:46:17.709
Shit.

01:46:24.959 --> 01:46:27.209
Verstuyft is here.
- How the hell can he be?

01:46:27.376 --> 01:46:30.584
He went inside via a trapdoor
in the street behind us.

01:46:30.751 --> 01:46:32.292
Wait here.

01:47:14.792 --> 01:47:16.584
Dammit, Cassiers.
- Sorry.

01:47:16.751 --> 01:47:19.542
Doesn't anyone follow orders anymore?
- You can't go alone.

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:28.417
Fucking hell!

01:48:29.292 --> 01:48:32.584
Rina? Rina? Rina?

01:48:47.126 --> 01:48:50.709
Are you OK? Are you OK? Listen to me.
Are you OK? Eh?

01:48:50.876 --> 01:48:54.001
It's me. Hey, hey, hey.
It's OK, it's OK.

01:48:54.167 --> 01:48:55.542
OK.

01:48:59.084 --> 01:49:01.042
Freddy?
- Clear.

01:49:02.376 --> 01:49:06.376
Goddammit. Stay here.
People are on their way. OK?

01:49:15.292 --> 01:49:17.084
Fuck.

01:49:19.417 --> 01:49:21.417
Stop! Stay there!

01:49:30.167 --> 01:49:31.459
Where's Freddy?

01:49:32.334 --> 01:49:36.084
Cassiers, call an ambulance
and lie on her to warm her up.

01:49:45.584 --> 01:49:49.001
Freddy. Freddy, don't.
The intervention team are on their way.

01:49:56.584 --> 01:49:58.459
Fuck!

01:50:48.084 --> 01:50:50.209
Hey, take it easy, take it easy.

01:51:37.042 --> 01:51:40.626
Sir? Are you OK? Are you hurt?

01:51:42.251 --> 01:51:43.917
Sir?

01:51:52.876 --> 01:51:54.459
Stop!

01:51:55.917 --> 01:51:57.584
Stay where you are.

01:52:03.751 --> 01:52:05.667
Don't move.

01:52:06.292 --> 01:52:08.876
Stay where you are.

01:52:18.542 --> 01:52:20.917
Stay where you are.

01:52:31.251 --> 01:52:32.584
Police. Get back.

01:53:18.667 --> 01:53:20.751
Are you alright?
- Yes.

01:53:20.917 --> 01:53:22.042
OK.
- Yeah.

01:53:24.126 --> 01:53:25.792
Rina.

01:53:27.501 --> 01:53:28.876
Don't let me go.

01:53:30.959 --> 01:53:32.251
Rina.

01:54:29.084 --> 01:54:33.709
Are you hurt? Should I take a look?
- I'm OK, I'm OK. It's fine.

01:54:37.417 --> 01:54:38.959
Rina.

01:55:34.251 --> 01:55:39.001
I need to explain something, Chief.

01:55:40.209 --> 01:55:43.792
The reason I've let Verstuyft
do as he likes lately is because...

01:55:43.959 --> 01:55:46.001
Well, he knows something about me that...

01:55:46.167 --> 01:55:49.626
Not the incident with Dirty Dave,
Cassiers? Everyone knows that.

01:55:51.917 --> 01:55:55.167
Where is the key?
Has the lab taken stuff already?

01:55:55.334 --> 01:55:57.501
No, everything is as it was.

01:56:11.126 --> 01:56:13.709
Where are they?
- They said it was OK.

01:56:13.959 --> 01:56:17.542
They didn't even want to go to hospital.
The policeman said he'd take care of her.

01:56:17.709 --> 01:56:21.042
Get them to look out for his car.
Use the traffic cameras to find him.

01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:23.417
Now, Cassiers.

01:56:29.501 --> 01:56:33.667
Why hasn't he been located? There are
thousands of cameras in the city.

01:56:33.917 --> 01:56:39.334
She manipulated us. She knows
how profilers work and we fell for it.

01:56:39.501 --> 01:56:42.292
We found her semi-naked and
groggy from drugs in Doel.

01:56:42.459 --> 01:56:45.001
Suppose she was caught
burying those bodies,

01:56:45.167 --> 01:56:48.459
the cleverest thing to do is
pretend to be a victim too, of course.

01:56:48.626 --> 01:56:51.209
You're caught so you go and
hang around naked 50 km away.

01:56:51.376 --> 01:56:53.626
Yes.
- It wouldn't occur to me to do that.

01:56:56.626 --> 01:57:01.042
Did Patrick say anything else?
- All kinds of stuff. He just raged on.

01:57:01.459 --> 01:57:02.709
Did he say why?

01:57:05.584 --> 01:57:09.251
I wasn't really listening.
Too busy not freezing.

01:57:11.126 --> 01:57:15.042
Yes? Through the old tunnel
to Linkeroever.

01:57:23.459 --> 01:57:25.251
Freddy, I'm going away for a while.

01:57:31.667 --> 01:57:33.292
Why don't you come too?

01:57:38.417 --> 01:57:42.209
Exhibiting those heads? She knew the
hammer injuries would lead us to Patrick.

01:57:42.376 --> 01:57:47.001
When did those heads appear?
When we no longer had any other suspects.

01:57:47.167 --> 01:57:48.959
So she sacrificed Patrick.

01:57:58.042 --> 01:58:00.501
Patrick was...
- Patrick is in the past.

01:58:00.667 --> 01:58:03.876
Patrick bashed that woman's head in.
And that's an end to it.

01:58:04.292 --> 01:58:05.542
Anxiety psychosis.

01:58:08.959 --> 01:58:12.417
You saw for yourself. He's an animal
if he doesn't take his pills.

01:58:12.584 --> 01:58:14.709
But who controls his pills?

01:58:30.584 --> 01:58:33.126
Yes, there, there.
- Fuck.

01:58:36.376 --> 01:58:41.084
Goddammit, Rina. What have you done?
- Patrick hit them.

01:58:41.751 --> 01:58:46.292
As for who held his hand,
you can't prove anything...

01:58:53.584 --> 01:58:57.584
The freezer. The freezer wasn't locked.

01:59:00.667 --> 01:59:02.792
It's over now, Rina.

01:59:03.417 --> 01:59:04.501
It's over.

01:59:07.584 --> 01:59:09.167
No.

01:59:10.751 --> 01:59:12.001
It's starting now.

01:59:19.959 --> 01:59:21.209
Dammit, Freddy.

02:00:13.001 --> 02:00:14.292
Freddy!

02:00:15.584 --> 02:00:17.042
Freddy.

02:00:18.792 --> 02:00:19.792
Freddy.

02:00:30.834 --> 02:00:33.209
It's me, Freddy. I...

02:00:33.876 --> 02:00:36.584
I... Sorry, pal.

02:00:39.834 --> 02:00:41.126
You have...

02:00:43.251 --> 02:00:48.209
You have...
to tell the investigating judge...

02:00:50.084 --> 02:00:51.667
that I...

02:00:52.876 --> 02:00:56.459
will have to move my appointment again.
