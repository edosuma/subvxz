08:40.020 --> 08:42.897
- I love that kid.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.897
- She's so cute.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.524
I'm getting married.

08:44.565 --> 08:48.445
This is gonna be

08:44.565 --> 08:48.445
the happiest day of my life.

08:49.779 --> 08:52.366
<i>[instrumental "Wedding March"]</i>

08:54.951 --> 08:57.412
[instrumental music]

09:03.126 --> 09:06.004
- Come on. Sit down.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.004
- What's so important?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.965
Shh. I want it to be

09:06.046 --> 09:08.965
a surprise. Sit down.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.094
I'm getting married.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.764
Hey, I love playing wedding.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.476
I'm not playing.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.476
This is for real.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.063
I'm going to marry

09:20.643 --> 09:23.063
Steve today.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.899
Whoa! He's a babe!

09:27.025 --> 09:29.694
You're telling me?

09:29.736 --> 09:32.239
But isn't that D.J.'s

09:29.736 --> 09:32.239
boyfriend?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.614
Not anymore.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.577
Hey, girls,

09:35.825 --> 09:37.577
what you doing?

09:37.618 --> 09:40.414
Aunt Becky,

09:37.618 --> 09:40.414
how do you have a wedding?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.707
Well, Michelle, you were at

09:40.455 --> 09:42.707
my wedding. Don't you remember?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.085
All I remember is..

09:45.126 --> 09:48.963
...throwing flowers,

09:45.126 --> 09:48.963
eating cake..

09:49.005 --> 09:52.384
...and wearing tights

09:49.005 --> 09:52.384
what made my knees itch.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.677
Well, I'll tell you what.

09:54.719 --> 09:58.056
We can look through

09:54.719 --> 09:58.056
my wedding album, okay?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.766
This will be

09:58.098 --> 09:59.766
a lot of fun.

09:59.807 --> 10:03.311
I haven't looked through

09:59.807 --> 10:03.311
this book in such a long time.

10:03.353 --> 10:09.234
Oh, look, look, look. Here we

10:03.353 --> 10:09.234
are arriving at the church.

10:09.276 --> 10:13.196
Oh, and here we are again

10:09.276 --> 10:13.196
arriving at the<i> correct</i> church.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.490
My dad was really nervous.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.075
You look so beautiful.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.160
'Aw, thanks.'

10:19.202 --> 10:22.414
I got to find

10:19.202 --> 10:22.414
a dress like that.

10:22.456 --> 10:23.915
Oh, you will, sweetheart.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.043
You are gonna make

10:23.957 --> 10:27.043
a beautiful bride someday.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.546
<i>Someday?</i>

10:29.588 --> 10:31.714
Denise.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.717
Look, here's Danny helping

10:31.756 --> 10:34.717
the caterer scrub some pots.

10:34.759 --> 10:38.138
Oh, and there you are

10:34.759 --> 10:38.138
scratching your itchy knees.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.646
Look at this, guys, I'm already

10:43.226 --> 10:46.646
on page 12. This is so cool.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.065
It is great living

10:46.687 --> 10:49.065
in the computer age.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.067
Although you guys are still

10:49.107 --> 10:51.067
living in the Crayola age, huh?

10:53.903 --> 10:56.490
Uncle Jesse,

10:53.903 --> 10:56.490
can I ask you a question?

10:56.531 --> 10:57.991
Sure, I'm on a little break

10:58.032 --> 10:59.618
or as we say

10:58.032 --> 10:59.618
in the computer world..

10:59.659 --> 11:01.953
...a little downtime.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.581
What happens

11:01.995 --> 11:04.581
after you have a wedding?

11:04.623 --> 11:06.583
Well, you kick out

11:04.623 --> 11:06.583
all the relatives

11:06.625 --> 11:10.170
count your toasters,

11:06.625 --> 11:10.170
then you go on your honeymoon.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.297
What's a honeymoon?

11:12.339 --> 11:16.635
Well, a honeymoon is, um,

11:12.339 --> 11:16.635
well, it's a very special time

11:16.675 --> 11:19.513
where the, uh,

11:16.675 --> 11:19.513
the newlywed couple, um..

11:21.181 --> 11:23.517
...they get to know each other.

11:23.558 --> 11:27.187
Don't they know each other

11:23.558 --> 11:27.187
before the wedding?

11:29.189 --> 11:30.524
Possibly.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.403
But now they don't have

11:33.234 --> 11:35.403
to hide it from their parents.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.867
What did you and Aunt Becky

11:37.030 --> 11:40.867
do on your honeymoon?

11:42.785 --> 11:44.120
We were very busy.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.789
Doing what?

11:48.249 --> 11:51.710
Uh, writing thank you notes

11:48.249 --> 11:51.710
for those toasters.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.712
Listen, let's just say

11:51.752 --> 11:53.712
that it's, it's a really

11:53.754 --> 11:55.882
really fun trip to go on, okay?

11:55.923 --> 11:57.342
Oh, thanks.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.802
Where are you gonna

11:57.384 --> 11:59.802
have your honeymoon?

11:59.844 --> 12:03.640
I don't know. Hawaii

11:59.844 --> 12:03.640
or Chuck E. Cheese.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.436
Come on, I got work to do.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.436
Run along, run along.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.651
Nicky, Alex,

12:12.691 --> 12:14.651
don't touch that.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.695
[beeping]

12:19.447 --> 12:22.242
"File erased?"

12:24.494 --> 12:25.786
Uh-oh.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.833
Excuse me. Move.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.600
Here it is

12:44.180 --> 12:46.600
Barbara Ann Varanelli.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.728
Danny, lets just drop it.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.728
I did not steal your girlfriend.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.439
We'll just see

12:49.768 --> 12:52.439
about that, won't we?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.734
Hello. Yes, is this

12:52.480 --> 12:55.734
Barbara Ann Varanelli?

12:55.774 --> 12:58.861
Yes, yes. From-from-from

12:55.774 --> 12:58.861
Golden Bay High School?

12:58.903 --> 13:00.530
I am so glad I got ahold of you.

13:00.572 --> 13:04.367
This, you're not gonna believe

13:00.572 --> 13:04.367
this. This is Danny Tanner.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.703
Right. Dan-Dan.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.122
Yeah, all cleared up.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.375
Look, the reason

13:10.707 --> 13:12.375
I'm calling you

13:12.417 --> 13:14.711
is-is actually

13:12.417 --> 13:14.711
kind of silly, because--

13:14.753 --> 13:16.755
It's very silly.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.716
That was actually

13:16.795 --> 13:19.716
Joey Gladstone.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.760
She wants to say hi.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.096
Ahem.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.014
Babs.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.266
Hey, how's it going?

13:28.308 --> 13:31.227
[chuckles]

13:28.308 --> 13:31.227
No, I can't.

13:31.269 --> 13:34.439
I don't do

13:31.269 --> 13:34.439
Flip Wilson anymore.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.232
Okay, for old time's sake.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.235
[imitating Flip Wilson]

13:36.274 --> 13:39.235
The devil made me

13:36.274 --> 13:39.235
do it, honey!

13:39.277 --> 13:40.361
Give me that.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.280
Hi, it's Dan-Dan again.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.782
I'm just gonna,

13:42.322 --> 13:43.782
I'm just gonna ask you this.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.575
When you were dating me

13:43.822 --> 13:45.575
in high school

13:45.617 --> 13:48.161
were you going out

13:45.617 --> 13:48.161
with Joey, too?

13:48.202 --> 13:50.371
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.082
No.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.209
Really?

13:55.251 --> 13:58.546
Oh. Well, thanks

13:55.251 --> 13:58.546
for clearing that up for me.

13:58.588 --> 14:01.215
Oh, no, thanks,

13:58.588 --> 14:01.215
but if I ever need any Amway

14:01.257 --> 14:02.967
I'll give you a call.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.929
Well, I guess you feel pretty

14:03.009 --> 14:06.929
darn silly right about now.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.181
Actually we should both feel

14:08.222 --> 14:09.890
pretty darn silly

14:08.222 --> 14:09.890
right about now.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.476
Turns out the only reason

14:09.932 --> 14:11.476
Barbara was going out

14:11.518 --> 14:14.312
with either of us was

14:11.518 --> 14:14.312
to make another guy jealous.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.105
Well, who was he?

14:16.147 --> 14:19.567
[sighs]

14:16.147 --> 14:19.567
Some younger guy.

14:16.147 --> 14:19.567
Maybe you know him.

14:19.609 --> 14:20.985
His name was..

14:21.027 --> 14:22.737
...Jesse Katsopolis.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.741
I<i> do</i> know him.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.161
Mayday! SOS!

14:30.203 --> 14:32.330
My whole report

14:30.203 --> 14:32.330
got erased.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.040
Oh, gee, that's too bad.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.751
Yeah, he's breaking my heart.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.214
- Hello.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.214
- Hey, you guys.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.341
Steph, Nicky and Alex

14:41.255 --> 14:43.341
got to my computer

14:43.383 --> 14:46.052
they erased my whole report.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.052
I need help.

14:46.093 --> 14:47.554
Alright, everyone, stand back.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.389
I'm gonna need

14:47.595 --> 14:49.389
plenty of hot water.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.724
To fix a computer?

14:50.765 --> 14:53.810
No, I want

14:50.765 --> 14:53.810
some hot chocolate.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.814
Hey, Nicky, Alex,

14:53.852 --> 14:57.814
my beautiful boys, hi!

14:57.856 --> 15:01.651
Tell me, what did you do

14:57.856 --> 15:01.651
to daddy's computer, huh?

15:01.693 --> 15:04.070
All gone.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.112
All gone.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.031
All gone?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.742
Jess, isn't that cute?

15:08.783 --> 15:11.578
I asked them what they did

15:08.783 --> 15:11.578
to your report and they said..

15:12.787 --> 15:16.957
Boys, daddy's computer

15:12.787 --> 15:16.957
is<i> not</i> a toy.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.088
(Jess)

15:19.836 --> 15:22.088
'Steph, you brought

15:19.836 --> 15:22.088
my report back.'

15:22.129 --> 15:23.757
- How'd you do that?

15:22.129 --> 15:23.757
- Simple.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.007
The automatic backup feature

15:25.049 --> 15:27.051
saves your document

15:25.049 --> 15:27.051
every ten minutes.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.345
Stephanie,

15:27.093 --> 15:29.345
you're a genius.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.180
Well, I wouldn't say that

15:31.222 --> 15:33.099
but you're more

15:31.222 --> 15:33.099
than welcome to.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.977
- Hi.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.977
- 'Hey.'

15:37.019 --> 15:38.563
Hey, Deej, how'd

15:37.019 --> 15:38.563
your bake sale go?

15:38.605 --> 15:41.524
Oh, it was great.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.524
Our class raised over $50.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.610
Of course, 35 of that

15:41.566 --> 15:43.610
was from Steve.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.446
Yeah, now, I'm broke 'cause

15:43.651 --> 15:46.446
I didn't see that stupid sign

15:46.487 --> 15:48.698
"You eat it,

15:46.487 --> 15:48.698
you bought it."

15:50.283 --> 15:52.076
Is everybody ready?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.369
Ready for what?

15:53.411 --> 15:56.205
For Michelle's wedding.

15:56.247 --> 16:00.209
Steve, I know you two

15:56.247 --> 16:00.209
will be very happy.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.672
Steven, Steven, Steven.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.883
Is there something you'd

16:04.714 --> 16:06.883
like to tell us, young man?

16:06.925 --> 16:09.636
Michelle was just playing.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.636
She asked Steve to marry her.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.971
He gave her a ring.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.971
It was so adorable.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.098
Yeah, it was really cute.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.392
You know, Steve

16:14.140 --> 16:16.392
you're a very lucky young man.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.727
You're gonna be

16:16.434 --> 16:17.727
married to a woman

16:17.769 --> 16:19.604
who can order

16:17.769 --> 16:19.604
from the kiddie menu.

16:21.522 --> 16:26.402
Ah, let's go, people.

16:21.522 --> 16:26.402
The other guests are here.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.195
- Come on. come on.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.195
- We got to go to a wedding.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.072
(Danny)

16:28.237 --> 16:30.072
'Oh, I can't wait

16:28.237 --> 16:30.072
to meet these other people.'

16:30.114 --> 16:31.825
Ah, let's see who's here.

16:31.866 --> 16:35.912
Oh, big bear. Yeah.

16:31.866 --> 16:35.912
Wow, look at the turnout.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.873
I don't recognize

16:35.954 --> 16:38.873
any of these guests.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.960
Here. You guys sit

16:38.915 --> 16:41.960
with the bride's family.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.837
Here we go.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.840
Okay. Everybody line up.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.091
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.304
Wow, this is

16:50.134 --> 16:53.304
really nice. Nice.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.890
- You ready?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.890
- 'Let's do it.'

16:57.684 --> 17:00.269
<i>["Wedding March" music]</i>

17:11.698 --> 17:13.950
What a beautiful bride.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.410
What a beautiful tablecloth.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.413
I think I'm gonna cry.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.665
You know, it's funny.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.750
I always thought

17:20.707 --> 17:22.750
you'd get married first.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.084
Don't start.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.223
Uh, you,

17:33.469 --> 17:37.223
the husband over here.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.059
Danny, look at it this way.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.394
You're not losing a daughter

17:41.435 --> 17:43.021
you're gaining

17:41.435 --> 17:43.021
a garbage disposal.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.234
- I'm so happy.

17:44.731 --> 17:48.234
- Yeah, me, too.

17:48.275 --> 17:52.154
Okay, the bride and groom

17:48.275 --> 17:52.154
have to hold hands.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.700
It's okay, Steve.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.700
I washed.

17:57.159 --> 18:01.039
Now, let's

17:57.159 --> 18:01.039
get you two married.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.917
Do you, Steve,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.917
want to marry Michelle?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.793
Yeah, sure.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.795
You're supposed

18:05.835 --> 18:07.795
to say, "I do."

18:07.837 --> 18:10.715
Oh, sorry. I do.

18:10.757 --> 18:15.511
Okay, do you, Michelle,

18:10.757 --> 18:15.511
want to marry Steve?

18:15.553 --> 18:17.764
You bet I do.

18:19.057 --> 18:23.978
Okay, I now announce

18:19.057 --> 18:23.978
you husband and wife.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.231
Yay!

18:30.150 --> 18:31.569
Great. Well, thanks, Michelle.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.153
This was fun,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.153
but I gotta get going, now.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.864
You can't go.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.825
But I have to. See, my mom's

18:34.906 --> 18:37.825
making meat loaf tonight.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.285
But we're married.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.413
We're supposed

18:39.326 --> 18:42.413
to stay together all the time.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.248
Uh, Michelle, you do realize

18:44.290 --> 18:46.500
this was just

18:44.290 --> 18:46.500
a pretend wedding, don't you?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.795
No, daddy,

18:46.542 --> 18:48.795
it was a real one.

18:50.463 --> 18:54.300
Well, I think we, uh, I think

18:50.463 --> 18:54.300
we might have a problem here.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.011
Uh, see, Michelle, if you

18:54.341 --> 18:57.011
were really married to Steve

18:57.053 --> 18:58.638
then you wouldn't be able

18:57.053 --> 18:58.638
to live in the same room

18:58.679 --> 18:59.680
with Stephanie anymore.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.557
- That's right.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.557
- My own room?

19:01.599 --> 19:04.184
I'm sure you two

19:01.599 --> 19:04.184
will be very happy.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.982
Uh, Michelle, what we mean is,

19:06.980 --> 19:08.982
after you get married

19:09.023 --> 19:11.400
you move away from your family.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.400
Is that what you really want?

19:11.442 --> 19:14.862
Uncle Jesse

19:11.442 --> 19:14.862
didn't move away.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.324
Yeah, good point.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.120
Steve, is Chuck E. Cheese

19:18.365 --> 19:22.120
alright for our honeymoon?

19:22.662 --> 19:23.997
Honeymoon?

19:26.540 --> 19:30.044
Um, listen, Michelle..

19:30.086 --> 19:31.712
My buddy.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.423
I think that, uh,

19:31.754 --> 19:34.423
I think that Steve and D.J.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.092
they were, uh, they were

19:34.465 --> 19:36.092
just kidding around.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.885
I mean, this, this whole thing

19:36.134 --> 19:37.885
isn't for real.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.595
I don't believe it.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.723
I'm sorry, honey, but what

19:39.637 --> 19:42.723
Uncle Jesse said is true.

19:44.058 --> 19:47.854
Michelle, we thought

19:44.058 --> 19:47.854
that you were just playing.

19:47.895 --> 19:51.357
- Steve?

19:47.895 --> 19:51.357
- Michelle, I'm really sorry.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.943
I thought we were

19:51.398 --> 19:53.943
just having some fun.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.779
That was mean,

19:53.985 --> 19:56.779
really mean.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.208
Michelle?

20:10.250 --> 20:13.212
I'm sorry

20:10.250 --> 20:13.212
you feel sad, honey.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.756
Why won't Steve marry me?

20:17.091 --> 20:19.677
Honey, you're six years old.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.263
You're too young

20:20.928 --> 20:23.263
to get married.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.894
But I love Steve.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.604
Look, I know you do

20:30.646 --> 20:33.774
but it's not the same kind

20:30.646 --> 20:33.774
of love that grownups feel

20:33.816 --> 20:35.193
when they get married.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.319
I hate being a little kid.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.697
I can't stay up late,

20:37.361 --> 20:39.697
I can't cross the street

20:39.739 --> 20:41.782
I can't get married.

20:44.202 --> 20:47.747
Oh, honey, I know

20:44.202 --> 20:47.747
how you feel.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.542
It's tough being a kid.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.670
And sometimes people forget

20:51.584 --> 20:54.670
how little kids have feelings.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.173
And right now, you're..

20:57.215 --> 21:00.093
What you're feeling

20:57.215 --> 21:00.093
is a broken heart.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.597
Can you fix it?

21:05.139 --> 21:06.849
I'll try.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.684
But you got

21:06.891 --> 21:08.684
to understand, see

21:08.726 --> 21:10.978
Steve is D.J.'s boyfriend.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.439
She loves him

21:11.020 --> 21:13.439
and he loves her.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.443
It's still broken.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.486
Come here, honey.

21:20.780 --> 21:24.324
Look...one day..

21:24.366 --> 21:25.952
...you'll be all grown-up

21:25.993 --> 21:27.954
and you'll have a boyfriend

21:27.995 --> 21:29.663
and then you'll

21:27.995 --> 21:29.663
fall in love.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.207
And then,

21:29.705 --> 21:31.207
when you're older than that

21:31.249 --> 21:35.044
much, much, much

21:31.249 --> 21:35.044
older than that..

21:35.086 --> 21:36.879
...you'll get married.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.505
And you'll get married

21:36.921 --> 21:38.505
because you want to spend

21:38.547 --> 21:41.175
all your time

21:38.547 --> 21:41.175
with that person.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.010
I don't wanna wait.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.344
Yeah, but there's

21:43.052 --> 21:44.344
something great about

21:44.386 --> 21:46.764
waiting for the person

21:44.386 --> 21:46.764
that you love.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.932
What?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.308
Well, in the mean time

21:47.974 --> 21:49.308
you get to be

21:49.349 --> 21:51.060
with all the people

21:49.349 --> 21:51.060
that you love.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.812
You know, your family.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.772
And we're gonna make sure

21:52.853 --> 21:54.772
that you have lots of fun

21:54.814 --> 21:57.316
and lots of hugs

21:54.814 --> 21:57.316
and lots of kisses.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.654
I think my heart

21:58.818 --> 22:01.654
is feeling better.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.073
Aw, that's my girl.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.616
I love you so much.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.951
[knock on door]

22:08.077 --> 22:10.454
Michelle, are you alright?

22:10.496 --> 22:11.747
I guess so.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.916
Michelle, look, I-I know

22:11.789 --> 22:13.916
you're angry at me

22:13.958 --> 22:15.042
but I want you to know

22:15.084 --> 22:17.044
I never meant

22:15.084 --> 22:17.044
to hurt your feelings.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.754
Are we still friends?

22:18.796 --> 22:21.507
Yeah, we're friends.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.885
D.J., he's all yours.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.013
Thanks, Michelle.

22:27.054 --> 22:28.306
You know, we're feeling pretty

22:28.346 --> 22:29.640
guilty about this whole thing

22:29.682 --> 22:31.892
so if there's anything

22:29.682 --> 22:31.892
we can do to make it up

22:31.934 --> 22:33.227
to you now's the time to ask.

22:33.269 --> 22:35.688
Yeah, you name it.

22:35.729 --> 22:39.275
Well, I'm thinking

22:35.729 --> 22:39.275
pizza and plenty of it.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.444
Sure. It's my treat.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.612
Thanks, Steve.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.906
Hey, no problem, Michelle.

22:49.827 --> 22:53.164
Uh, Mr. Tanner, could I borrow

22:49.827 --> 22:53.164
a couple of bucks?

22:54.581 --> 22:55.791
Don't worry about it.

22:55.833 --> 22:58.544
I'll put it on your tab.

22:58.585 --> 23:03.007
Come on, Steve. By the way,

22:58.585 --> 23:03.007
call me "Mr. Tanner, sir."
