WEBVTT

00:00.534 --> 00:03.204
[music playing]

00:07.175 --> 00:08.609
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.244
The subject on the
"Ricki Lake Show"

00:10.278 --> 00:12.246
is, Too fat to be a drag queen.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.014
Ma, ma, ma!

00:14.048 --> 00:15.549
You've got to get Channel 4.

00:15.583 --> 00:16.817
You're not gonna believe this.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.918
HOST (ON TV):
"Hollywood Tonight"

00:17.951 --> 00:19.387
has learned that
all of Hollywood

00:19.420 --> 00:21.422
is in a feverish bidding
war for the rights

00:21.455 --> 00:23.291
to the life story
of Illinois lottery

00:23.324 --> 00:24.758
winner, Roseanne Conner.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.560
That's you, that's you.
HOST (ON TV): The housewife--

00:26.594 --> 00:27.995
Oh my god!
Turn that up!

00:31.299 --> 00:32.700
Hello?

00:32.733 --> 00:35.236
Yeah, this is her.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.604
What?

00:36.637 --> 00:38.706
DJ, it's some network
guy from Los Angeles.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.940
Howard Morton?
- Oh!

00:39.973 --> 00:41.075
Even I've heard of him.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.076
Wow.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.411
Uh, yeah.

00:43.444 --> 00:47.915
Yeah, OK, well-- oh, could
you hold on a minute, Howard?

00:47.948 --> 00:49.850
I've got another call.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.852
Hello?
Yeah.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.454
Yeah, it is.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.356
You're from where?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.758
Oh, well isn't that
a cable station?

00:57.791 --> 00:58.859
Listen, could you hold a minute?

00:58.892 --> 01:02.163
I got a real network
on the other line.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.566
Yeah, Howard, hello.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.769
No, I really don't
have any people

01:08.802 --> 01:11.805
that could call your people.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.875
Why don't you just come here
and talk to me yourself?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.244
All right then.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.077
Thank you.

01:20.148 --> 01:24.218
DJ, a star is born.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.586
[theme - blues traveler]

01:25.619 --> 01:29.623
THEME SONG: If what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

01:29.657 --> 01:34.362
we're gonna last longer than
the greatest wall in China,

01:34.395 --> 01:38.166
or that rabbit with the drum.

01:38.199 --> 01:42.803
If there's one thing that
I learned while waiting

01:42.836 --> 01:45.673
for my turn, is
that in each life

01:45.706 --> 01:49.910
some rain falls, but
you also get some sun.

01:49.943 --> 01:57.618
And we'll make out better
than OK, hear what I say?

01:57.651 --> 01:59.520
Yeah, any day.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.463
[laughs]

02:09.497 --> 02:12.433
[music playing]

02:12.466 --> 02:14.168
I can't believe the
department store

02:14.202 --> 02:16.204
delivered all these clothes.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.706
Yes, along with
my own clothes boy.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.076
God, I wonder what I'm
going to wear to try

02:23.110 --> 02:25.078
to impress this network guy.

02:25.112 --> 02:27.415
Well this looks very fetching.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.749
Oh, that is divine.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.418
Now see that is
something that you

02:30.451 --> 02:32.786
should maybe wear when you have
your picture in "TV Guide."

02:32.820 --> 02:33.654
Hey, hey.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.523
I'm going for the cover.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.991
I need something a
little more bold.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.160
Perhaps this.

02:40.194 --> 02:41.929
Oh, that's great.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.064
Now you know who
you'd look like?

02:44.097 --> 02:48.202
That-- that Anna Nicole Smith.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.070
That's who should play me.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.539
See?

02:51.572 --> 02:54.942
She's seen her share of pain,
and yet she's still beautiful.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.944
And smart enough
to hook herself up

02:56.977 --> 03:01.515
with some old coot that's
got both feet in the grave.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.417
Gently, gently.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.385
Hey, hey.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.687
I'm paying for it.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.057
Just can't decide--

03:10.090 --> 03:11.825
I think I'm partial to this one.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.828
[gasps] I just decided
who should play me--

03:14.862 --> 03:17.931
Jaclyn Smith.

03:17.965 --> 03:21.435
She's the queen of the MOWs.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.636
I don't know.

03:22.670 --> 03:24.672
I just cannot decide.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.407
Shall I have another
truckload brought over?

03:29.142 --> 03:30.311
Hey, hey, hey.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.045
Look who's slacking now.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.848
Hey, this is my
meeting, not yours.

03:34.882 --> 03:35.749
Just relax.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.318
I just want to meet him.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.453
Although TV isn't
my medium of choice,

03:39.487 --> 03:43.557
it doesn't hurt to make
a few future connections.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.293
Hello, hello.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.329
I trust I'm now
entering Hollywood East.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.963
Oh, Scott, you look great.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.799
You look just like a lawyer.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.267
Well I am a lawyer.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.436
[gasps] These
dresses are fabulous!

03:59.340 --> 04:02.209
Is this what you're
going to be wearing?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.712
You know, you are so good.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.347
I just can't believe it.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.948
Where else would
I find a guy who

04:07.981 --> 04:11.819
could pick out the perfect dress
and cause a great big Hollywood

04:11.852 --> 04:12.786
movie deal?

04:12.820 --> 04:13.954
Oh, I don't know--

04:13.987 --> 04:16.424
Universal, Warner Brothers,
Paramount, Disney.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.226
[music playing]

04:20.728 --> 04:24.298
Debbie, you must be so excited
about Roseanne's meeting today.

04:24.332 --> 04:27.267
I'd be a lot more excited
if I was allowed to be there.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.937
Oh, to be a fly on the wall.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.673
She treats me like a child!

04:32.706 --> 04:35.108
[doorbell]

04:35.142 --> 04:37.445
I mean, it's not
like I would just

04:37.478 --> 04:40.180
blurt out that I was
a lesbian in front

04:40.213 --> 04:41.214
of a complete stranger.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.288
Can I help you?

04:48.322 --> 04:51.459
I'm looking for
Ms. Beverly Harris.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.393
That's me.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.895
Oh, my name is Frank Andrews.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.430
I'm a journalist,
and I was hoping

04:56.464 --> 04:57.931
to get an interview with you.

04:57.965 --> 04:58.832
Really?

04:58.866 --> 04:59.933
Yes.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.935
The mother of the woman
who won the lottery?

05:01.969 --> 05:02.970
Oh.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.205
I think it's a very
compelling story.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.275
"Bev-y," where
are your manners?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.679
Why don't you invite
the nice man in?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.113
Hello.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.984
Hi, Leon Carp, and it's
spelled just like the fish.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.185
Ah.

05:18.218 --> 05:23.757
- And I'm Joyce L-E-V-I-N-E.
- "Le-veen."

05:23.791 --> 05:26.827
"Luh-vine."

05:26.860 --> 05:29.430
So what paper
do you write for?

05:29.463 --> 05:33.701
Oh, I'm freelance, actually,
but I've done stories

05:33.734 --> 05:35.035
for all the big publications.

05:35.068 --> 05:38.972
You know, "Atlantic Monthly,"
"The New Yorker," "People."

05:39.006 --> 05:39.873
Oh!

05:39.907 --> 05:40.774
Wow.

05:40.808 --> 05:41.909
OK, OK.

05:41.942 --> 05:46.414
Well in that case, why
don't you just sit right

05:46.447 --> 05:49.216
down here by me,
darling, and I will

05:49.249 --> 05:51.452
tell you all about "Bev-y."

05:51.485 --> 05:54.287
Well now, Joyce, I have
known her a lot longer.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.323
Oh, but I know
her a lot better.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.827
[laughs]

05:59.860 --> 06:01.995
I want to hear
from all of you,

06:02.029 --> 06:05.833
but I think I'll start with Bev.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.268
Oh my, where shall we start?

06:08.301 --> 06:09.870
Yeah, there's so many.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.239
I-- I hope you have
more paper in the car.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.206
[laughter]

06:13.240 --> 06:17.578
[music playing]

06:17.611 --> 06:20.548
Boy, I'm gonna charm the
pants off of these people.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.684
This is a slam dunk.

06:23.717 --> 06:27.054
Wow, what a remarkable
piece of sculpture.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.657
Such a brash statement
about the inevitable failure

06:29.690 --> 06:31.058
of technology.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.793
No, sir, that's
a Buick on blocks.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.365
Guess who?

06:38.398 --> 06:41.268
Howard Morton, president
of ABX, and this

06:41.301 --> 06:42.803
is my associate, Bill Morris.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.104
Hello.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.440
This is unbelievable.

06:46.474 --> 06:49.076
I've read your
story over 15 times,

06:49.109 --> 06:51.779
and every time I read it I
said, What does Rosie look like?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.614
And this is what I imagined--
- No, no.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.748
I'm her.

06:54.782 --> 06:55.683
I know.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.085
I was just talking
to your brother.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.487
Look what I have for you--

06:59.520 --> 07:02.956
ABX hats and t-shirts,
and they're free.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.458
In other words, they're
not going to come out

07:04.492 --> 07:06.226
of the budget of this project.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.227
Howard Morton.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.497
Nice to meet you, sir.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.798
Sit down.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.101
We at ABX are so excited
about your movie of the week

07:14.134 --> 07:16.303
and, if it works, a
guaranteed series.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.406
Well hold on, my client
hasn't said yes yet.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.242
Yeah, Scott here is, uh, well
he's kind of my lawyer for now

07:22.275 --> 07:23.611
anyway.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.813
Well I didn't know they had
entertainment lawyers here in,

07:25.846 --> 07:26.714
uh--

07:26.747 --> 07:28.415
Lanford.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.519
Actually, my field
is probate law.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.153
Now I am particularly
concerned what

07:33.186 --> 07:35.055
is going to happen to
my client's interest

07:35.088 --> 07:37.491
in this project
after she's dead?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.595
Gee, Scott, I--

07:41.629 --> 07:43.296
I don't think after I'm dead
that I'm really going to be

07:43.330 --> 07:44.364
interested in much of anything.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.599
[inaudible]

07:45.633 --> 07:47.501
Look, let me make it clear
to you what's going on.

07:47.535 --> 07:49.302
First of all, isn't your
husband involved in this?

07:49.336 --> 07:50.203
Yeah.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.271
Uh, Dan?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.974
DAN: [belches]

07:54.007 --> 07:57.244
Well shouldn'ta
drank those milkshakes.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.012
Well I-- I think
maybe we're going

07:59.046 --> 08:01.715
to have to excuse my husband.

08:01.749 --> 08:05.418
He just found out he's
lactose intolerant.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.121
DAN: [groaning] Oh god.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.523
Look, I feel that my client--

08:09.557 --> 08:12.192
Let me tell you a little
bit about myself, OK?

08:12.225 --> 08:16.429
First of all, television is in
my blood from the ground up.

08:16.463 --> 08:21.034
I graduated from Harvard, I
got a Masters at Yale in Drama,

08:21.068 --> 08:23.704
I went to Carnegie
Mellon and got a PhD.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.706
And how did you get
involved with this network?

08:25.739 --> 08:28.341
A friend of my
dad's got me a job.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.276
Huh.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.911
Well that's all
very interesting,

08:30.944 --> 08:33.681
but what we really want to
hear about is this movie.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.715
Oh, give me that chart.

08:34.748 --> 08:35.616
Hi.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.284
Oh, this is my son, DJ.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.753
DJ, this is Mr. Howard Morton.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.321
Mr. Morton, it's
so nice to meet you.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.256
I'm familiar with
your body of work.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.925
Thanks, BJ.

08:44.958 --> 08:45.959
It's DJ.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.160
I'm a filmmaker myself.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.562
I mean, I have a reel
here if you wouldn't

08:48.596 --> 08:50.497
mind taking a look at it.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.032
I think I have a unique voice.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.067
Yeah, you do have
a unique voice.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.368
I'll show this to
the executives,

08:55.402 --> 08:56.570
see what they think.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.371
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very so much.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.911
What's wrong with him?

09:03.944 --> 09:05.879
Nothing.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.581
Must be the haircut.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.684
Yes, anyway, you were about
to tell us about the movie.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.385
Normally I don't get
involved with this garbage,

09:12.419 --> 09:15.288
but this is a fascinating story.

09:15.322 --> 09:19.126
Your profile was extremely long
vis-a-vis urban focus groups,

09:19.159 --> 09:22.395
but you're Q-Rating outside
the major metropolitan areas,

09:22.429 --> 09:25.332
especially amongst states
with high levels of lottery

09:25.365 --> 09:27.735
participation, was
significant enough

09:27.768 --> 09:30.370
for us to think the right
time slot could yield

09:30.403 --> 09:32.840
excellent demographics,
a strong rating,

09:32.873 --> 09:35.308
and a very good audience share.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.011
Uh, could you just speak
regular English to us?

09:38.045 --> 09:40.180
I'm sure you must've picked
that up at Yale or Harvard

09:40.213 --> 09:42.783
or the Mellon Ball school.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.153
I'm gonna talk
slower and louder, OK?

09:46.186 --> 09:48.922
You're blue collar.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.558
Middle America is blue collar.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.095
The Americans want to see
themselves on television.

09:55.128 --> 09:55.996
Got it?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.464
Yes, got it.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.967
Who would you like
to see play Rosie?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.635
I got a surprise for you--

10:01.669 --> 10:03.536
what if I said Melanie Griffith?

10:03.570 --> 10:04.672
Melanie Griffith?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.873
I knew you were
going to say that.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.340
You don't think we can get her.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.777
I've already sent her the
story and she loves it,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.244
and her husband loves it.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.379
Can you believe that?

10:12.412 --> 10:13.981
The cover of "TV Guide"--

10:14.014 --> 10:18.485
"Rosie," starring Melanie
Griffith and Don Johnson.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.621
She's not even married
Don Johnson any more.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.124
Oh, that's right
Antonio Bonaduce.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.526
Yeah, that means we'll get to
"Partridge Family" following.

10:26.559 --> 10:27.961
This is a guaranteed hit.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.362
OK, you've got to
be kidding me, right?

10:29.396 --> 10:33.967
Because Melanie Griffith
looks nothing like me.

10:34.001 --> 10:38.538
Roxy, we can't have
fat people on TV.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.807
What about Rosie?

10:39.840 --> 10:40.708
Who?

10:40.741 --> 10:41.608
Rosey Grier.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.642
Not Rosey Grier.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.644
That's the one OJ confessed to.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.379
Rosie O'Donnell!

10:46.413 --> 10:47.480
Who's he?

10:47.514 --> 10:48.515
Daytime.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.217
Oh, fat works in daytime.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.418
It doesn't work in prime time.

10:51.451 --> 10:53.286
Uh, why is that?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.421
Because.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.189
Because why?

10:56.223 --> 10:57.390
Just because.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.960
That's why.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.161
OK.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.063
This-- this really doesn't
make any sense at all.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.464
Just a minute ago
you were saying

11:04.497 --> 11:06.934
that the American people want to
see a reflection of themselves

11:06.967 --> 11:08.301
on TV.

11:08.335 --> 11:12.940
Look, Roseanne, I don't want
the fat to come between us.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.943
We'll compromise-- Oprah.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.544
Oprah's black.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.713
Don't see why
that's brilliant?

11:19.747 --> 11:20.914
If it doesn't work
on our network,

11:20.948 --> 11:21.849
we could sell it to FOX.

11:25.052 --> 11:28.588
Well Oprah lost
all her weight.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.757
Do you have a dog?

11:29.790 --> 11:30.690
No.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.493
That smell's from
the old carpet.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.363
Uh, we've got a girl
stuck in a well in Idaho.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.497
Get the rights to it.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.867
We might want to animate
it for Saturday morning.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.302
Now listen to me--

11:42.335 --> 11:44.772
what we do on our network
that no other network does

11:44.805 --> 11:48.375
is we put humor into everything
so the whole family can watch.

11:48.408 --> 11:51.812
I'll give you an example, a
guy is married for 30 years,

11:51.845 --> 11:53.246
all right, true to his wife.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.648
He's at the Christmas party--

11:55.682 --> 11:57.785
and there's his wife
brushing her teeth.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.686
He said, Honey, what's going on?

11:59.719 --> 12:02.856
She said, Quiet,
you'll wake my mother.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.757
Oh my god!

12:03.791 --> 12:06.126
That's horribly offensive.

12:06.159 --> 12:06.994
Of course it is.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.495
It's cable crap.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.263
We don't do that on ABX.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.631
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.466
You've got to do
your story with us.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.603
Well you're not even talking
about my story anymore.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.773
You guys said you wanna do a
real story about my family.

12:19.807 --> 12:22.876
Roseanne, the base
characters are your family,

12:22.910 --> 12:24.644
but we have to make
them attractive.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.746
Nobody in their right mind is
going to want to look at you.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.085
Mr. Morton, may I
point out that any waiver

12:32.119 --> 12:36.389
of legatee obligation without
prima facie evidence of, uh,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.625
equalized participation
would constitute

12:38.658 --> 12:41.161
a nunc pro tunc agreement.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.330
Yeah, exactly.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.631
What did you say?

12:44.664 --> 12:45.866
I'm not sure.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.402
I just want to let him know
we can be confusing too.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.404
Let me simplify it.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.575
It's "Friends" meets "Party
of Five" meets "Savannah."

12:55.608 --> 12:57.410
Bingo.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.213
So you're saying that it'll be
about a bunch bulimics and two

13:00.247 --> 13:03.583
shows that nobody watches?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.253
I have been doing
this for a long time--

13:06.286 --> 13:07.821
over a year and a half--

13:07.855 --> 13:10.357
and I know what the American
public wants to see.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.060
Well I really don't
think you do, Howard.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.795
You're talking to us like you
think we're a bunch of hicks,

13:15.829 --> 13:17.264
but you're the real hick.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.100
You're totally out of touch with
what the American people want.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.035
I get what's going on here.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.771
Chubby is incredibly
difficult to deal with.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.672
Now look--

13:25.705 --> 13:27.040
Sit down.

13:27.074 --> 13:27.941
Let's go.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.511
[inaudible]

13:31.544 --> 13:33.813
You know, I want to say one
more thing before I leave,

13:33.847 --> 13:35.582
and I'm sure you'll
agree with me.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.418
That was one fantastic meeting.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.488
All we have to do is have
lunch, iron out a few details,

13:41.521 --> 13:43.390
and we've got a smash movie.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.058
Don't lose any weight, Melanie.

13:45.092 --> 13:48.428
Good luck at little league.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.263
I think we've got him
just where we want him.

13:50.297 --> 13:53.533
Let me type up my notes.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.501
Great faced.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.702
Howard.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.438
Bobby, how's
the softball team?

13:58.471 --> 13:59.806
We're still undefeated.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.074
Boy, you still got the grip.

14:07.647 --> 14:11.484
Hi, Mrs. Conner, I'm Bobby
Barrows, president of the Home

14:11.518 --> 14:14.621
Movie Channel Cable Network.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.822
Yeah, sit down.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.725
Uh, well looks like we
got ourselves another one.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.297
[music playing]

14:24.331 --> 14:25.899
No, it is absolutely true.

14:25.933 --> 14:31.738
Roseanne stole a-- a gallon jar
of mayonnaise from Rodbell's.

14:31.771 --> 14:32.805
[laughs]

14:32.839 --> 14:36.443
Well she claimed
that she borrowed it.

14:36.476 --> 14:42.549
For that matter, she also
borrowed an 18-pound salami.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.952
That must have
been some sandwich.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.653
[laughs]

14:46.686 --> 14:48.221
Well now wait--

14:48.255 --> 14:50.057
I got a better Roseanne
story than that.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.925
Well I'm all ears.

14:51.959 --> 14:58.165
Well one time Roseanne
found this bag of marijuana

14:58.198 --> 15:01.468
and, at first, she thought
that it belonged to David.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.171
You see, he and Darlene
were having sex,

15:04.204 --> 15:06.039
so Roseanne let him
live in the basement.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.478
Anyway, it turned out not
to be David's after all.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.213
Remember, it was Roseanne?

15:13.246 --> 15:16.116
[laughter]

15:16.149 --> 15:22.789
Now, was that before or
after DJ stole the car?

15:22.822 --> 15:23.790
Oh, before, I--

15:23.823 --> 15:24.691
I think.

15:24.724 --> 15:25.825
Wasn't it?

15:25.858 --> 15:27.961
Hey, with Roseanne it's
it's all just a blur.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.696
[laughter]

15:29.729 --> 15:33.466
Oh, I haven't had so much fun
since I opened for Jamie Farr

15:33.500 --> 15:35.935
at the Silver Slipper.

15:35.969 --> 15:40.740
I must be off, but you have
all been just delightful.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.510
This story practically
writes itself.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.978
Oh.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.215
Could you tell us when it--
when it's going to come out?

15:48.248 --> 15:50.317
Uh, trust me.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.819
You won't be able to miss it.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.655
[music playing]

15:57.690 --> 15:59.459
So I guess the
bottom line is this--

15:59.492 --> 16:03.963
we had HMC are very eager to do
a movie about your life story.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.333
Well I didn't
figure that you were

16:06.366 --> 16:07.767
here to give us free cable.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.139
Can you get us free cable?

16:15.208 --> 16:17.144
Ms. Barrows, we've
already had a meeting

16:17.177 --> 16:18.578
with the president of ABX.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.314
Yes, and he had
an assistant, too.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.117
Came right up to his elbow.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.086
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.022
I go back a long
way with Howard.

16:29.056 --> 16:32.825
Let me guess-- he told
you he loves your story,

16:32.859 --> 16:34.861
but he just wants to
change a few things.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.197
Is that right?

16:37.230 --> 16:40.500
No fat people, no gay people.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.403
He basically just wants to
sanitize your entire life,

16:43.436 --> 16:45.238
am I right?

16:45.272 --> 16:47.674
That's pretty much
exactly what he said.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.443
Of course he did,
and that's exactly

16:50.477 --> 16:52.779
why you got to go with Cable.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.947
Now we can't pay you
the same kind of money

16:54.981 --> 16:56.783
the network can pay,
but what do you care?

16:56.816 --> 16:58.051
You got $108 million.

17:00.987 --> 17:04.124
We can give you something
that the network can't--

17:04.157 --> 17:06.626
the chance to tell your story.

17:06.659 --> 17:10.730
Complete, as it is,
totally uncensored.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.832
Well that is what
I want, you know,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.634
I mean if I decide to do it.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.537
Well I'm sure you are familiar
with some of our critically

17:17.570 --> 17:19.772
acclaimed shows.

17:19.806 --> 17:24.744
Our expose on the white
supremacist in Montana,

17:24.777 --> 17:29.015
our 10-part series on
the life of Beethoven--

17:29.048 --> 17:31.851
And all the naked
movies on Friday night!

17:31.884 --> 17:32.752
Oh, yeah!

17:32.785 --> 17:35.255
Yeah, yeah.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.490
Drive-in Friday nights.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.893
Hey, are you guys really going
to get Pamela Lee to host?

17:40.927 --> 17:44.231
We're in talks with her, yes.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.933
We can feature all different
kinds of programming

17:46.966 --> 17:49.369
because we're not
slaves to the ratings.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.803
The only thing we
have to care about

17:50.837 --> 17:55.108
is that our subscribers get
their payments in on time.

17:55.142 --> 17:58.211
Ms. Barrows, I'm a
lawyer and even though I

17:58.245 --> 18:00.413
specialize in probate law--

18:00.447 --> 18:02.949
Listen, your client
dies, her family's still

18:02.982 --> 18:05.385
in for 100% of the action, OK?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
Well that answers
all my questions.

18:15.027 --> 18:19.031
So I could really have
my story told uncensored?

18:19.065 --> 18:20.200
Absolutely.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.535
For example, I
understand that when

18:22.569 --> 18:24.971
you told your husband the
news about the lottery win,

18:25.004 --> 18:26.873
you were wearing your bra.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.807
Yes, she was.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.108
Yes, she was.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.877
I was there!

18:30.910 --> 18:32.979
Now you see on
our network, you

18:33.012 --> 18:39.352
could be topless or even totally
nude if you wanted to be.

18:42.189 --> 18:46.559
And instead of saying, Gee
whiz, I won the lottery,

18:46.593 --> 18:50.963
you could say, Well
[bleep] jackpot!

18:59.506 --> 19:00.973
Wow!

19:01.007 --> 19:05.278
Where the hell did you grow up?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.179
Oh.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.079
Hi.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.181
This is my son, DJ.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.816
DJ, this is Ms. Barrows.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.819
Ms. Barrows, wow, I'm
familiar with your body of work.

19:12.852 --> 19:13.720
Yeah.

19:13.753 --> 19:14.987
Thanks, kid.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.323
You know, I'm a
filmmaker myself.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.491
I have reel here if you wouldn't
mind taking a look at it.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.592
I think I have a unique voice.

19:19.626 --> 19:20.860
Yeah, yeah.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.562
I'll have one of my development
execs take a look at it.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.496
Thank you.

19:23.530 --> 19:24.864
Thank you, thank
you very so much.

19:24.897 --> 19:27.634
OK, good, good.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.468
What's wrong with him?

19:32.505 --> 19:33.740
Nothing!

19:33.773 --> 19:34.574
Must be the haircut.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.545
All right, so where was I?

19:38.578 --> 19:39.679
Let me see now--

19:39.712 --> 19:41.047
nudity, profanity.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.815
Oh yeah, gay people.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.252
We love the fact that
your daughter is gay.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.288
Well, no, actually it's
our mother that's gay.

19:48.321 --> 19:51.724
Yeah, well that's fine, but
the daughter has got to be gay.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.925
The pretty blonde one.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.067
Uh, well my
daughter is not gay.

20:01.100 --> 20:05.004
Look, doll, there's
got to be a reason here

20:05.037 --> 20:06.773
why we're going on to cable.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.841
Do you understand?

20:08.875 --> 20:12.712
Picture this-- you get the
news of the lottery win,

20:12.745 --> 20:15.415
and there comes your
daughter and Drew Barrymore

20:15.448 --> 20:17.116
in the shower together--

20:17.149 --> 20:19.486
OK, that is enough!

20:19.519 --> 20:21.288
Stop, that's enough.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.990
Let me just
shorthand this for you.

20:24.023 --> 20:27.560
This is "Biography"
meets "Dream On" by way

20:27.594 --> 20:28.828
of the "Red Shoe Diaries."

20:28.861 --> 20:30.263
Get it?

20:30.297 --> 20:31.698
Yeah, I get it.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.865
I get it totally.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.534
You're exactly like
the network guy.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.269
He wants to totally
clean me up, and you

20:36.303 --> 20:38.170
wanna totally sleaze me up.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.539
Get out!

20:39.572 --> 20:51.784
You know, you are a real
[bleep],, but you got to admit

20:51.818 --> 20:53.353
this has been one fan--

20:53.386 --> 20:56.289
[bleep] --tastic meeting.

20:56.323 --> 20:57.557
I'll be in touch, baby.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.391
Ciao.

21:06.165 --> 21:09.402
It is going to be
really, really tough

21:09.436 --> 21:12.305
to watch the Emmys this year.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.374
[music playing]

21:14.407 --> 21:17.910
FRANK ANDREWS: Trust me, you
won't be able to miss it.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.951
ROSEANNE: What the hell?

21:24.984 --> 21:27.387
It must've been a slow
week for two-headed goats!

21:31.458 --> 21:34.361

21:54.947 --> 21:55.014
