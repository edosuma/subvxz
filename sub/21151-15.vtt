00:24.358 --> 00:27.295
HALTING HEX INSIDE THE DEN.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.631
>> THE TEMPTATION AND THE

HALT THE NEXT FOUR EVICTIONS.

00:36.737 --> 00:37.371
CONSEQUENCE COULD FOLLOW.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.408
THE TEMPTATION INSIDE THE DEN

00:40.441 --> 00:42.443
HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.546
THIS CONSEQUENCE WILL AFFECT THE

00:45.579 --> 00:48.048

I DO LOVE YOU GUYS.

01:24.985 --> 01:27.087
>> AT THE NOMINATION CEREMONY,

01:27.121 --> 01:29.523
JESS WENT FOR A PAWN AND A

01:30.258 --> 01:32.092

01:32.826 --> 01:35.796

01:35.829 --> 01:39.633
TO KICK THEM TO THE CURB.

01:39.667 --> 01:46.039
>> WE NEED TO KEEP JOSH IN HERE.

01:46.073 --> 01:52.045
>> SOON AFTER, PAUL LET JOSH

01:52.079 --> 01:53.781
KNOW HE COULD BE STAYING.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.049
>> WITH THE VETO ON THE LINE,

01:56.083 --> 01:58.252
JESSICA BLEW THE COMPETITION

01:58.286 --> 02:03.123
AWAY.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.693
>> CONGRATULATIONS, JESSICA!

02:05.726 --> 02:10.364
YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF

02:10.398 --> 02:11.064
THE VETO.

02:11.098 --> 02:14.034
>> HOPING JESS WOULDN'T USE THE

02:14.067 --> 02:16.804
VETO --

02:16.837 --> 02:22.843
>> PAUL ADVISED JOSH TO LAY LOW.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.378
>> DO WHAT YOU DO BEST!

02:24.412 --> 02:29.082
AND JUST GO BE EMOTIONAL.

02:29.116 --> 02:40.428
>> BUT JESSICA WAS TORN.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.463
>> I THINK YOU'RE BEING MORE

02:42.496 --> 02:43.364
PARANOID THAN YOU NEED TO BE.

02:43.397 --> 02:47.201
>> AT THE VETO MEETING, JESSICA

02:47.235 --> 02:49.270
MAY HAVE UNINTENTIONALLY SEALED

02:49.303 --> 02:49.970
RAMSES FATE.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.306
>> I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO USE THE

02:52.340 --> 02:53.441
POWER OF VETO.

02:53.474 --> 02:56.444
I'M HOPING THURSDAY I DON'T GET

02:56.477 --> 02:57.411
BLIND-SIDED AND JOSH WALKS OUT.

02:57.445 --> 03:00.648
>> WILL PAUL'S PLAN GO THROUGH

03:00.681 --> 03:03.484
OR WILL THE HOUSE FLIP ON THE

03:03.517 --> 03:04.151
MEATBALL?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.119
PLUS, A NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD

03:06.153 --> 03:07.321
WILL BE CROWNED.

03:07.355 --> 03:07.855
ALL OF THIS LIVE ON "BIG

03:07.888 --> 03:10.057
BROTHER"!

03:10.090 --> 03:20.701
>> THE JUICE IS LOOSE!

03:20.734 --> 03:21.402
>> GOOD EVENING.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.771
I'M JULIE CHEN.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.738
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

03:24.772 --> 03:27.708
JESSICA HAS HAD ONE OF THE MOST

03:27.741 --> 03:30.844
SUCCESSFUL WEEKS IN THE HISTORY

03:30.878 --> 03:31.545
OF "BIG BROTHER."

03:31.579 --> 03:32.846
FIRST, AMERICA TEMPTED HER WITH

03:32.880 --> 03:35.549
THE HALTING HEX.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.885
THEN THE BATTLE BACK GOT HER MAN

03:37.918 --> 03:38.719
BACK IN THE GAME.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.921
SHE PROCEEDED TO WIN THE HOH

03:40.954 --> 03:43.123
COMPETITION AND THE POWER OF

03:43.156 --> 03:43.824
VETO.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.225
BUT HER HOT STREAK COULD ALL BE

03:45.259 --> 03:47.861
FOR NOT IF SHE DOESN'T SEE HER

03:47.895 --> 03:50.298
TARGET, JOSH, WALK OUT THE FRONT

03:50.331 --> 03:51.299
DOOR TONIGHT.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.467
SO WHO WILL BE SENT PACK

03:53.501 --> 03:55.068
SOMETHING WE'LL SOON FIND OUT.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.605
FIRST, JESSICA DECIDED NOT TO

03:57.638 --> 03:58.772
USE THE VETO.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.774
A DECISION THAT COULD COST HER

04:00.808 --> 04:03.311
AND HER ALLIES DEARLY.

04:03.344 --> 04:07.080
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS

04:07.114 --> 04:10.451
ADJOURNED.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.053
>> I DECIDED NOT TO USE THE

04:13.086 --> 04:17.591
POWER OF VETO TO PREVENT

04:17.625 --> 04:18.559
RUFFLING MORE FEATHERS.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.361
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T BITE ME IN

04:20.394 --> 04:21.495
THE BUTT.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.230
JOSH, YOU CLAIM THAT CODY AND I

04:23.263 --> 04:24.565
WOULD BE LEAVING BEFORE YOU.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.666
THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.669
NOT ONLY THAT, I GET TO BE THE

04:28.702 --> 04:31.939
ONE THAT GETS TO SEND YOU

04:31.972 --> 04:32.773
PACKING.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.642
>> RIGHT NOW, EVERYONE IS

04:34.675 --> 04:36.444
TELLING ME THAT JOSH IS THE

04:36.477 --> 04:37.144
TARGET.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.946
I SHOULD BE SAFE BUT YOU NEVER

04:38.979 --> 04:40.013
KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.750
>> SO MY PLAN THIS WEEK IS TO

04:42.783 --> 04:44.151
FLIP THE VOTES AND GET RAMSES

04:44.184 --> 04:46.820
OUT INSTEAD OF JOSH, INCLUDING

04:46.854 --> 04:48.021
ME, I ALREADY HAVE SEVEN VOTES

04:48.055 --> 04:49.823
TO GET RAMSES OUT.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.826
KEVIN, RAVEN AND MATT, ALEX,

04:52.860 --> 04:55.363
JASON AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

04:55.396 --> 04:56.029
CHRISTMAS.

04:56.063 --> 04:56.964
I'M A LITTLE BIT WORRIED THAT

04:56.997 --> 04:58.866
MARK AND ELENA HAVE REKINDLED

04:58.899 --> 05:01.469
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH YES, SIR

05:01.502 --> 05:02.336
AND CODY.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.338
I CAN'T RISK GETTING MY PLANNED

05:04.372 --> 05:05.005
BLOWN UP.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.306
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW DOESN'T

05:06.340 --> 05:06.974
HURT THEM.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.709
>> JESS, NOT USING THE VETO,

05:08.742 --> 05:12.012
THAT WAS A ROOKIE MISTAKE.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.414
THE HOUSE IS KEEPING ME THIS

05:13.447 --> 05:16.350
WEEK AND YOU AND YOUR BOYFRIEND

05:16.384 --> 05:21.455
ARE GETTING MEATBALL BLINDSIDED,

05:21.489 --> 05:24.257
BABY GIRL.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.559
>> I SHOULD BE NERVOUS.

05:25.593 --> 05:32.232
FELL LIKE I'M GOING TO VOMIT.

05:32.265 --> 05:38.238
>> DON'T GET TO HAPPY.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.475
>> I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR ME TO

05:41.509 --> 05:43.811
WALK AROUND, KEEP MOVING AROUND,

05:43.844 --> 05:47.347
KEEP BEING DEPRESSED AND KEEP

05:47.381 --> 05:49.249
PUTTING ON THIS ACT.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.952
>> YOU HAVE A HEADACHE?

05:51.985 --> 05:56.289
>> A MIGRAINE.

05:56.323 --> 06:02.062
>> I TAKE ADVIL.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.165
>> IT'S OKAY.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.568
>> I'M EITHER GOING TO LOSE MY

06:07.601 --> 06:09.002
MIND COMPLETELY AND GO CRAZY OR

06:09.036 --> 06:12.573
WIN AN EMMY FOR THIS

06:12.606 --> 06:13.707
PERFORMANCE.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.275
EITHER OR, THEY'RE GOING TO BUY

06:15.308 --> 06:18.378
THAT I'M GOING HOME THIS

06:18.412 --> 06:25.218
THURSDAY.

06:25.252 --> 06:28.789
>> EVERYTHING IS STILL THE SAME.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.224
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

06:31.258 --> 06:32.292
I DON'T GIVE A --

06:32.325 --> 06:33.794
>> I KNOW ABOUT THIS PLAN, WHICH

06:33.827 --> 06:37.297
IS GOING TO EVICT THE STRONGEST

06:37.330 --> 06:39.299
PLAYER, WHICH WOULD BE RAMSES.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.400
EVERYBODY IS ON PLAN.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.602
I THOUGHT WHY ROCK PLAN?

06:41.635 --> 06:42.870
I'M GOING TO STICK WITH IT AND

06:42.903 --> 06:44.638
SEE HOW THINGS DO FROM THERE.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.207
RAMSES, I LIKE YOU.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.043
SEE YOU FOR THANKSGIVING.

06:50.077 --> 07:00.120
>> JUST GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

07:00.120 --> 07:09.229
>> JUST GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

07:19.573 --> 07:24.578
*

07:24.612 --> 07:33.654
*

07:33.687 --> 07:37.658
>

07:37.691 --> 07:40.393
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.261
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD WANT TO

07:41.294 --> 07:41.962
KEEP JOSH IN THE HOUSE.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.798
>> YOU GUYS ARE LOCKED IN?

07:44.832 --> 07:48.536
>> THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN STAY IN

07:48.569 --> 07:48.969
THIS HOUSE.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.037
>> GOOD.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.873
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOUR BED.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.275
>> EVER SINCE CODY CAME BACK AND

07:55.308 --> 07:56.744
JESS GOT POWER, THINGS HAVE

07:56.777 --> 07:59.079
CHANGED WITH MARK AND ELENA.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.247
IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY'RE YUMMY

08:00.280 --> 08:05.352
WITH JESSICA AND CODY AGAIN.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.320
>> THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT

08:07.354 --> 08:09.923
TOO CHUMMY FOR MY LIKING.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.059
MARK AND ELENA ARE IN THE

08:12.092 --> 08:15.295
KITCHEN WITH JESS AND CODY,

08:15.328 --> 08:18.599
OUTSIDE WITH JESS AND CODY OR

08:18.632 --> 08:20.968
WORKING OUT WITH JESS AND CODY.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.302
EVERYTHING WITH JESS AND CODY.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.137
THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE SHOWERING

08:24.171 --> 08:25.238
WITH JESS AND CODY AT THIS

08:25.272 --> 08:25.773
POINT.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.740
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD

08:26.774 --> 08:27.641
CONSIDERING THEY WEREN'T DOING

08:27.675 --> 08:32.445
ANY OF THAT THIS TIME LAST WEEK.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.247
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I COULDN'T

08:34.281 --> 08:37.585
TELL YOU ABOUT THE WHOLE JOSH

08:37.618 --> 08:38.385
RAMSES SWITCH.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.253
SO I'M GOING TO KEEP YOU GUYS IN

08:40.287 --> 08:41.922

BLIND-SIDED ALONG WITH YOUR

08:46.326 --> 08:47.861
PALS, JESS AND CODY.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.630

08:49.663 --> 08:51.364
>> AND THE BROMANCE CONTINUES.

08:51.398 --> 09:05.045
>> YES, IT DOES!

09:05.078 --> 09:08.348
>> IT WAS BE EASY FOR US TO

09:08.381 --> 09:14.788
REGROUP AND SEE LIKE WHO IS

09:14.822 --> 09:16.456
GOING TO WORK WITH AND --

09:16.489 --> 09:19.359
>> MOVING FORWARD, I WANT TO

09:19.392 --> 09:21.461
WORK WITH JESS AND CODY.

09:21.494 --> 09:33.506
THEY'RE STRONG COMPETITORS.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.742
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO CHRISTMAS

09:34.775 --> 09:37.310
ABOUT HER GAME.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.511
WHATEVER HAPPENS THIS WEEK,

09:38.545 --> 09:40.113
WE'RE GOING TO DRAW LINES AGAIN.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.415
>> I'M PRETENDING TO WORK WITH

09:42.449 --> 09:43.016
MARK.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.952
I DON'T TRUST HIM ONE BIT.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.387
THE GUY HAD NO PROBLEM

09:47.420 --> 09:48.822
BACK-STABBING ME BEFORE.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.123
HE'S IN THE GAME WITH ME.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.326
>> WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE?

09:53.360 --> 10:03.136
>> YEAH.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.071
>> FAST FORWARD TO THURSDAY

10:04.104 --> 10:05.038

10:05.072 --> 10:11.178

I WOULD LIKE TO.

10:12.245 --> 10:16.249
>> YOU FEEL DIFFERENTLY NOW THAT

10:16.283 --> 10:17.951
HOMEY IS BACK?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.120
>> I LIKE HIM.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.023
JUST I'VE ALWAYS LIKED HIM.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.457
I'M GLAD WE HAVE A CLEAN SLATE.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.292
>> WHAT?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.627
OH, OH, OH, YOU HAVE A CLEAN

10:27.661 --> 10:28.361
SLATE WITH CODY.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.263
LET ME WRITE THAT DOWN.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.398
A CLEAN SLATE WITH CODY.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.399
WHAT ELSE?

10:32.432 --> 10:36.003
>> IDEALLY HE LIKES TO WORK WITH

10:36.036 --> 10:36.704
US.

10:36.737 --> 10:37.971
>> YEAH, THEY DO WHAT THEY DID

10:38.005 --> 10:38.806
THIS WEEK.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.607
IT TAKES MORE THAN ONE WEEK,

10:40.640 --> 10:41.441
KNOW?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.142
>> YEAH.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.576
>> TIT FOR TAT KIND OF THE DEAL.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.544
>> I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THAT

10:44.577 --> 10:45.478
DON'T STRATEGY.

10:45.512 --> 10:46.046
I DON'T AT ALL.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.148
>> BETTER JUST NEUTRAL.

10:48.181 --> 10:52.953
>> I HATE IT.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.521
>> I LOVE IT.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.823
THERE'S TWO PEOPLE OR A PAIR

10:55.856 --> 10:58.992
THAT ARE PLAYING THE GAME IN A

10:59.026 --> 11:01.094
WAY THAT I HATE.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.764
>> YOU DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THAT

11:03.797 --> 11:06.133
STAY NEUTRAL, A PAIR?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.568
SOUNDS LIKE MATT AND RAVEN BUT

11:08.601 --> 11:09.436
I'LL LET THEM KNOW.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.404
>> IF SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN --

11:11.438 --> 11:12.105
>> IT'S DIFFERENT FOR ME BECAUSE

11:12.139 --> 11:15.275
I'M CONNECTED WITH ELENA.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.145
AND THE LAST THING I'D WANT TO

11:18.178 --> 11:24.017
DO IS -- BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT

11:24.051 --> 11:24.684
HAPPENS.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.853
>> THANK YOU FOR THIS GROCERY

11:25.886 --> 11:28.488
LIST OF RED FLAGS.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.890
I'LL PLAY POOL WITH YOU ANY TIME

11:29.923 --> 11:41.401
THAT YOU NEED AND I'M ON MY WAY.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.271
>> OH, YOU SMELL GOOD.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.340
>> THANKS.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.577
>> LIKE YOU'RE IN BED WITH YOUR

11:50.610 --> 11:53.513
TYPICAL NAP.

11:53.546 --> 11:56.583
>> OH!

11:56.616 --> 11:59.787
.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.539
>> HE MADE A COMMENT LIKE HE'S

12:19.572 --> 12:20.240
SUPER WEIRD.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.343
LIKE THERE'S A BEAR IN HERE, A

12:23.376 --> 12:25.078
BEAR.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.980
THAT DIDN'T STIR THE POT.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.316
STAYS NEUTRAL AND REALLY

12:29.349 --> 12:32.285
STARTING TO PISS ME OFF.

12:32.319 --> 12:38.758
>> THAT'S WHAT MARK SAID?

12:38.792 --> 12:42.429
>> MY BEST GUESS WOULD BE --

12:42.462 --> 12:47.267
THIS IS JUST -- I'M LETTING YOU

12:47.300 --> 12:49.469
KNOW.

12:49.502 --> 12:54.241
>> JESSICA AND CODY ARE --

12:54.274 --> 12:55.675
>> YEAH, BIG TIME.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.946
>> MARK WAKES UP EVERY MORNING

12:58.979 --> 13:08.655
AND GOES UP THERE.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.859
>> MARK, IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

13:11.892 --> 13:13.393
MATT AND I, THAT JUST SEALED THE

13:13.426 --> 13:15.829
DEAL FOR ME.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.464
I CAN'T TRUST YOU AT ALL.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.866
YOU THINK WE'RE JUST LYING UNDER

13:18.899 --> 13:21.668
THE RADAR IN OUR PASSIVE PEOPLE?

13:21.701 --> 13:24.504
YOU'LL SEE HOW PASSIVE WE ARE

13:24.537 --> 13:26.473
WHEN MATT AND I WIN HOH AND YOU

13:26.506 --> 13:29.776
AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND ARE ON THE

13:29.809 --> 13:31.078
BLOCK.

13:31.111 --> 13:39.386
>> THEY'RE LIKE A SEESAW.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.788
>> HEY, YOU BEEN TALKING TO

13:41.821 --> 13:42.890
ANYBODY, LIKE MAKING SURE

13:42.923 --> 13:45.325
EVERYBODY'S HEAD IS RIGHT?

13:45.358 --> 13:46.026
>> YEAH.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.428
SOME PEOPLE ARE SKETCHY.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.498
THE THING IS, PEOPLE WANT TO

13:51.531 --> 13:54.634
KEEP IT WITH YOU GUYS.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.770
>> IF THAT HAPPENS, I'LL NEVER

13:57.804 --> 14:01.108
TRUST ANYBODY.

14:01.141 --> 14:03.810
>> I JUST HAVE THIS DREAM THAT

14:03.843 --> 14:05.345
LIKE JOSH GOES OUT THAT DOOR AND

14:05.378 --> 14:09.116
THEY'RE JUST LIKE A FLURRY OF

14:09.149 --> 14:09.582
BOOS.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.252
AND I'LL JUST --

14:12.285 --> 14:15.788
>> MY BODY WILL JUST LIKE BE

14:15.822 --> 14:17.324
FILLED WITH JOY.

14:17.357 --> 14:17.958
>> SATISFACTION.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.227
>> SCREW THE $500,000.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.628
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.197
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

14:24.231 --> 14:35.042
>> IF THERE'S EVEN --

14:35.075 --> 14:38.178
>> UP NEXT, THE STAGE IS SET FOR

14:38.211 --> 14:40.447
A BLINDSIDE.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.951
ONE SLIP COULD CHANGE THE

14:43.984 --> 14:45.885
OUTCOME OF TONIGHT'S LIVE VOTE

14:45.919 --> 14:47.955
AND EVICTION.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.422
RAMSES OR JOSH, WHO WILL BE

14:49.456 --> 14:50.723
SHOWN THE FRONT DOOR?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.492
AND BECAUSE JESSICA ACCEPTED THE

14:52.525 --> 14:53.994
HALTING HEX TEMPTATION, A

14:54.027 --> 14:54.928
CONSEQUENCE WILL BE UNLEASHED

14:54.962 --> 14:55.728
INTO THE HOUSE.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.465
I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THIS NEW

14:58.498 --> 14:59.432
GAME-CHANGING TWIST BEFORE THE

14:59.466 --> 14:59.933
HOUR IS UP.

14:59.967 --> 15:00.367
STAY WITH US.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.153
>> WELCOME BACK TO "BIG

15:20.187 --> 15:21.054
BROTHER."

15:21.088 --> 15:24.124
AGREEING TO A BLINDSIDE IS ONE

15:24.157 --> 15:24.824
THING.

15:24.857 --> 15:34.767
KEEPING IT A SECRET IS ANOTHER.

15:34.801 --> 15:39.406
>> JESSICA, HOW ARE WE DOING?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.341
>> SO MUCH BETTER.

15:41.374 --> 15:46.179
I WON HOH AND I WON POWER OF

15:46.213 --> 15:46.779
VETO.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.448
IT WAS LIKE THE BEST WEEK.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.583
>> EVERYONE DESERVES A CHANCE.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.121
DID YOU WIN THE OTHER THING,

15:54.154 --> 15:54.554
TOO?

15:54.587 --> 15:56.823
THE TEMPTATION?

15:56.856 --> 15:57.757
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.760
IS IT GOOD OR BAD?

16:00.793 --> 16:06.099
>> LET'S JUST SAY IT'S BETTER

16:06.133 --> 16:07.700
THAN PAUL.

16:07.734 --> 16:12.739
CODY AND I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.075
>> YOU CAN'T GO ON THE BLOCK?

16:15.108 --> 16:15.508
HOW LONG?

16:15.542 --> 16:16.409
THE WHOLE THING?

16:16.443 --> 16:17.210
>> NO.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.178
NOT THE WHOLE THING.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.081
>> FOUR WEEKS, SOMETHING LIKE

16:21.114 --> 16:21.548
THAT?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.583
JUST HYPOTHETICAL.

16:23.616 --> 16:28.655
AMERICA LOVES YOU.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.358
>> OUT OF EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE,

16:31.391 --> 16:32.592
CODY AND I DO HAVE SOME TRUST

16:32.625 --> 16:33.360
WITH KEVIN.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.927
I DON'T WANT TO LIE TO HIM.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.296
SO I'M HOPING THAT'S NOT GOING

16:36.329 --> 16:38.431
TO TURN OUT AND BITE ME.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.333
I'M TRUSTING HE KEEPS MY SECRET

16:40.367 --> 16:41.834
FOR NOW ANYWAY.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.336
>> THAT'S COOL, JESS.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.471
YOU HAD YOUR BACK AGAINST THE

16:44.504 --> 16:46.706
WALL THE WHOLE TIME.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.175
HONESTLY, I WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.010
ME AND JESSICA HAVE A GOOD

16:51.044 --> 16:51.778
RELATIONSHIP.

16:51.811 --> 16:52.945
SHE'S FROM THE NEW ENGLAND AREA.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.048
I TRY TO LOOK UP FOR HE, SHE

16:55.082 --> 16:57.317
LOOKS OUT FOR ME.

16:57.350 --> 17:06.659
>> I KNEW YOU HAD IT.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.428
>> I KNOW ABOUT THIS PLAN TO GET

17:08.461 --> 17:09.362
RID OF RAMSES.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.663
I DON'T THINK JESS HAS ANY IDEA

17:10.697 --> 17:12.999
WHAT'S GOING ON.

17:13.032 --> 17:13.933
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN AGAINST HER

17:13.966 --> 17:15.502
ALL SEASON.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.638
I WANT TO LET HER KNOW SHE'S

17:18.671 --> 17:25.745
ABOUT TO GET BLINDSIDE.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.780
>> I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO

17:27.814 --> 17:28.181
FLIP.

17:28.215 --> 17:28.548
>> YOU THINK?

17:28.581 --> 17:29.249
>> YEAH.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.119
THE LITTLE KID WITH THE GLASSES

17:32.152 --> 17:42.395
IS GOING.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.697
>> BE COOL.

17:44.731 --> 17:53.806
DON'T FREAK OUT.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.710
>> I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BECAUSE

17:57.744 --> 17:59.679
I WISH I TRUSTED MY GET.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.648
I KNEW I DIDN'T USE THE VETO,

18:01.681 --> 18:04.417
SOMEBODY WOULD TRY TO KEEP JOSH

18:04.451 --> 18:14.494
IN THE HOUSE.

18:14.494 --> 18:20.867
IN THE HOUSE.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.706
>> WE NEED TO GO OVER IT IN HERE

18:26.739 --> 18:28.475
BEFORE I START SCREAMING.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.677
MY ASSUMPTION IS CORRECT.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.944
I THINK PAUL IS TRYING TO RALLY

18:31.978 --> 18:38.218
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.320
THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THAT

18:40.353 --> 18:41.421
RAMSES GOES HOME TOMORROW.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.021
>> ALL RIGHT.

18:42.054 --> 18:46.426
WE HAVE KEVIN, ELENA, ME.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.561
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW KEVIN WILL

18:48.595 --> 18:50.897
VOTE TO K EP RAMSES?

18:50.930 --> 18:52.365
WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.234
THE ONLY VOTES I TRUST ARE YOURS

18:54.267 --> 18:56.903
AND ELENA.

18:56.936 --> 19:01.308
I DON'T TRUST MARK.

19:01.341 --> 19:05.077
I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT EVERY

19:05.111 --> 19:06.379
CONVERSATION THAT GOES ON

19:06.413 --> 19:10.483
DOWNSTAIRS.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.485
I WANT TO GRAB PAUL AND DRAG HIM

19:12.519 --> 19:13.620
IN HERE AND KICK HIM IN THE

19:13.653 --> 19:14.321
FACE.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.922
>> I NEED TO LOCK IN THE NUMBERS

19:15.955 --> 19:17.590
FOR THIS VOTE.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.392
TECHNICALLY I ONLY NEED FIVE AND

19:19.426 --> 19:21.694
I CAN BE THE TIEBREAKER.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.496
CODY AND I NEED TO GET TO WORK

19:23.530 --> 19:25.365
AND START CAMPAIGNING RIGHT NOW.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.601
>> I NEED YOU GUYS TO VOTE OUT

19:28.635 --> 19:30.670
JOSH TOMORROW.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.972
I'LL BE SURPRISED IF ANYBODY

19:33.005 --> 19:33.740
OTHER THAN JOSH GOES HOME.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.208
>> DO NOT WORRY ABOUT ME.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.476
>> OKAY.

19:36.509 --> 19:40.313
>> I'M NOT VOTING TO KEEP JOSH.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.382
I'M VOTING HIS AGAINST OUT.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.352
>> I NEVER ASK FOR ANYTHING.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.053
PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME YOUR VOTE

19:47.086 --> 19:47.754
FOR JOSH.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.421
THINK ABOUT IT.

19:48.455 --> 19:50.857
>> DEFINITELY.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.259
>> THANK YOU.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.027
>> ARE YOU GOING TO VOTE TO KEEP

19:55.061 --> 19:58.298
RAMSES FOR SURE?

19:58.331 --> 20:08.375
100%?

20:08.375 --> 20:14.013
100%?

20:14.046 --> 20:21.588
>> JOSH IS GOING HOME.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.356
>> ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

20:23.390 --> 20:26.759
ARE YOU DECLARING WAR ON ME AND

20:26.793 --> 20:30.062
THE REST OF THE HOUSE?

20:30.096 --> 20:32.299
>> ALL RIGHT, CODY, FINE.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.201
STRAP ON YOUR BOOTS, PAL.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.069
LET'S GO TO WAR.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.306
>> UP NEXT, IT'S THE LIVE VOTE

20:39.339 --> 20:41.408
AND EVICTION.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.075
RAMSES THINKS HE'S SAFE.

20:43.109 --> 20:45.478
JOSH THINKS HE'S SAFE.

20:45.512 --> 20:45.978
ONLY ONE CAN BE RIGHT.

20:46.012 --> 20:46.446
STAY WITH US.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.507
>> WELCOME BACK TO "BIG

21:14.541 --> 21:15.207
BROTHER."

21:15.241 --> 21:16.042
IT'S NOW TIME FOR THE LIVE VOTE

21:16.075 --> 21:17.877
AND EVICTION.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.878
RAMSES OR JOSH.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.180
WITH THE BLINDSIDE EXPOSED, IT'S

21:21.213 --> 21:24.451
UP IN THE AIR AS TO WHO IS GOING

21:24.484 --> 21:25.117
HOME TONIGHT.

21:25.151 --> 21:26.252
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM

21:26.285 --> 21:27.253
HELLO, HOUSE GUESTS!

21:27.286 --> 21:28.521
>> HI!

21:28.555 --> 21:29.389
>> HI, EVERYBODY.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.624
IT'S NOW TIME FOR THE LIVE VOTE

21:31.658 --> 21:33.593
AND EVICTION.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.995
RAMSES, JOSH, IN JUST MOMENTS

21:36.028 --> 21:37.864
YOUR HOUSE MATES WILL CAST THEIR

21:37.897 --> 21:38.931
VOTES TO EVICT LIVE.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.133
BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH HAVE A

21:41.167 --> 21:44.136
FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY THEIR VOTES

21:44.170 --> 21:46.606
WITH ONE BRIEF STATEMENT.

21:46.639 --> 21:47.306
RAMSES, YOU'RE FIRST.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.941
>> OKAY.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.977
YOU GUYS, THIS TIME HERE HAS

21:51.010 --> 21:52.479
BEEN SO SUPER FUN AND I DON'T

21:52.512 --> 21:55.448
WANT THAT TO END.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.148
HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE THIS

21:56.182 --> 21:57.417
POSITION SUCKS AND I DON'T THINK

21:57.450 --> 21:59.419
I DESERVE TO BE HERE.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.787
I HOPE YOU VOTE TO KEEP ME

22:00.820 --> 22:02.755
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I CAN HELP A

22:02.789 --> 22:04.023
LOT OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND YOU

22:04.056 --> 22:05.658
HAVE TO THINK THERE'S A JURY

22:05.692 --> 22:06.993
COMING AND WHO YOU WANT TO LIVE

22:07.026 --> 22:10.262
WITH AND WHO WILL HELP YOU,

22:10.296 --> 22:10.963
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE IN A

22:10.997 --> 22:12.765
POSITION LIKE I AM RIGHT NOW AND

22:12.799 --> 22:14.066
WHO WILL GIVE YOU THE VOTES IN

22:14.100 --> 22:15.301
THE FOLLOWING WEEKS.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.736
HELP ME OUT AND KEEP ME.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.438
>> THANK YOU, RAMSES.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.138
JOSH?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.440
>> FIRST OFF, ALL THE GLORY TO

22:20.473 --> 22:22.141

JUST LIKE GOT CRAZY.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.423

I WAS MAKING SURE THAT I GOT THE

29:25.464 --> 29:26.132
VOTES.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.699
I FEEL LIKE OTHER PEOPLE ALREADY

29:27.733 --> 29:29.401
HAD REALLY GOOD LINKS THAT THEY

29:29.435 --> 29:30.269
HAD BEEN WORKING TOGETHER FROM

29:30.302 --> 29:32.604
THE BEGINNING OF THIS GAME.

29:32.638 --> 29:34.573
ONCE I TRIED TO GET TO THEM, IT

29:34.606 --> 29:36.642
DIDN'T WORK OUT AS WELL AS I

29:36.675 --> 29:37.276
THOUGHT.

29:37.309 --> 29:38.210
>> IT APPEARS THAT YOU WERE

29:38.244 --> 29:40.312
FRIENDS WITH EVERY PERSON IN THE

29:40.346 --> 29:40.612
HOUSE.

29:40.646 --> 29:41.280
>> YEAH.

>> NOBODY HAD A PROBLEM WITH

29:42.181 --> 29:42.849
YOU.

YET IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE YOU HAD

29:44.350 --> 29:45.051
AN ALLIANCE WITH ANY PERSON IN

29:45.084 --> 29:45.451
THE HOUSE.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.352
>> ABSOLUTELY.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.019
YEAH.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.520
>> DID YOU HAVE A STRATEGY TO

29:48.554 --> 29:50.056
PLAY THIS GAME?

29:50.089 --> 29:51.790
>> WELL, YES.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.460
WELL, I WAS LIKE MY BASE WAS

29:54.493 --> 29:55.661
JUST BE FRIENDS WITH EVERYBODY

29:55.694 --> 29:56.963
AND STAY CLOSE WITH ONE PERSON

29:56.996 --> 30:00.466
AND THAT ONE PERSON TO ME AT THE

30:00.499 --> 30:02.368
BEGINNING WAS JILLIAN.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.870
WHEN SHE LEFT, I DIDN'T KNOW

30:03.903 --> 30:04.636
WHAT TO DO.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.339
THERE WAS A POINT THAT BOTH

30:07.373 --> 30:09.842
SIDES, NEITHER WERE ON MY SIDE.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.710
IT WAS LIKE HOLY CRAP, WHAT DO I

30:11.743 --> 30:12.544
DO FROM HERE?

30:12.578 --> 30:13.212
IT SUCKS.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.848
>> YOU'RE A SELF-PROCLAIMED

30:15.882 --> 30:17.149
SUPER FAN OF "BIG BROTHER."

30:17.183 --> 30:18.084
>> YEAH.

30:18.117 --> 30:20.052
>> WAS THIS GAME HARDER TO PLAY

30:20.086 --> 30:21.387
THAN YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE?

30:21.420 --> 30:21.820
>> YEAH.

30:21.854 --> 30:22.521
IT'S LIKE WEIRD.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.255
YOU'RE IN THERE.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.257
I'M IN THE HOUSE WITH A BUNCH OF

30:25.291 --> 30:25.958
PEOPLE.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.259
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE OH, MY GOD,

30:27.293 --> 30:28.160
I'M IN "BIG BROTHER."

30:28.194 --> 30:29.661
YOU'RE THERE AND YOU HAVE TO

30:29.695 --> 30:30.997
SOCIALIZE, YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE

30:32.264 --> 30:34.867
YOU NEED TO DO TO GET TO THE

30:34.901 --> 30:35.534
END.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.136
I FEEL LIKE I LACKED IN THAT

30:37.169 --> 30:37.769
AREA.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.305
>> DID THEY MAKE A MISTAKE

30:39.338 --> 30:42.208
BOUNCING YOU AND KEEPING JOSH?

30:42.241 --> 30:43.910
>> I ABSOLUTELY THINK SO.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.077
I COULD HAVE BEEN A BIG

30:45.111 --> 30:46.678
THREAT -- WELL, I DON'T KNOW

30:46.712 --> 30:48.881
ABOUT THREAT, BUT I COULD HAVE

30:48.915 --> 30:50.249
BEEN SOMEONE THAT COULD HAVE

30:50.282 --> 30:51.717
BEEN LOYAL IF SOMEONE PICKED ME
