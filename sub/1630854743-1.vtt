00:34.034 --> 00:34.868
SPACE

00:36.286 --> 00:39.122

03:00.638 --> 03:02.307
[panting] This is Captain Yun Jung-yi.

[man] <i>Captain Yun.</i>
<i>After that explosion, are you still alive?</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:07.729
How else can I be answering?

03:08.396 --> 03:11.107
[man] <i>How is your team?</i>
<i>Did you reach the fuel rod?</i>

03:11.608 --> 03:13.276
I don't see anyone else.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.237
[sighing] It's not looking good.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.245
What is that?

03:24.329 --> 03:27.248
[man] <i>We have intel that</i>

Ugh, maybe lead with that?

03:29.334 --> 03:31.711
[man] <i>The e-battery is attached</i>

07:13.641 --> 07:14.809
Stay focused, all right?

07:15.893 --> 07:18.104
- [man 1] Check on the rail gun.
- [man 2] Yeah, on it.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.691
[sighing] She keeps failing
at the same point.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.860
[woman] That's what I'm saying.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.737
Should I send the data to the lab
for a detailed analysis?

07:26.821 --> 07:28.656
- [man 1] Yes, send it over right away.
- Okay.

07:28.739 --> 07:29.782
[man 2] Team Leader Yun.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.325
Ma'am.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.871
[man 1] Why does this keep happening?

07:34.954 --> 07:38.624
[woman] I don't know. But I see why
she was considered a legendary mercenary.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.878
Did you see how many robots it destroyed
on its way to the fail point?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.129
[man 1] Seriously.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.424
[woman] You don't think it's because
the enemy's been poorly programmed?

07:46.507 --> 07:49.135
[man 2] Oh, we should tweak
how the simulation starts next time.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.928
No, no, no, no, no, no.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.097
Listen, we have to keep
the start the same.

07:53.181 --> 07:57.310
The simulation has to match the real life
situation in order to map the brain.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.604
Let's all call it a day.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.106
- There are important guests arriving soon.
- Yes.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.691
- Of course, ma'am.
- [woman] Yes, ma'am.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.778
[tablet beeping]

08:07.862 --> 08:08.738
Oh man.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.157
[clicking]

08:15.953 --> 08:17.872
- Here you go.
- [woman] Thanks.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.457
[devices beeping]

08:25.838 --> 08:27.215
[man 1] Let's get moving.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.308
[tense music playing]

08:47.443 --> 08:49.529
Should I send this
to the Technical Support Team?

08:49.612 --> 08:50.821
Yeah, looks good.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.926
[dramatic music rises]

09:15.096 --> 09:17.306
Before we go, we'll finish things up.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.266
Okay.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.149
[music ends]

10:09.525 --> 10:11.027
[calming piano music playing]

10:11.110 --> 10:13.112
[muffled recorded announcement]

10:26.542 --> 10:27.585
Excuse me.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.086
Come here.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.963
Does this look fresh to you?

10:32.757 --> 10:33.758
Directly from the boat.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.427
I can see…

10:37.345 --> 10:39.555
it appears to have a rotten expression.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.058
[snickers]

10:42.642 --> 10:44.226
You shouldn't be shocked.

10:45.061 --> 10:45.895
I'm kidding.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.647
A joke.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.731
[exaggerated laugh]

10:49.732 --> 10:50.858
Keep up the good work.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.029
[exhales nervously]

10:56.072 --> 10:57.698
Right. Let's get a move on.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.409
You all know how important today is.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.756
Oh, Team Leader Yun, you're here.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.634
[dramatically] Thank you
for your hard work.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.760
Director.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.472
Is all of this
preparation really necessary?

11:21.555 --> 11:22.932
They're a different generation.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.935
Our elders value these things
more than you think.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.021
[sighing]

11:29.105 --> 11:31.232
I hope you aren't nervous. Are you okay?

11:31.899 --> 11:33.818
Or did you not sleep well?

11:33.901 --> 11:35.027
I'm fine.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.322
Should I be concerned?

11:38.406 --> 11:40.074
Because you seem to be on edge.

11:40.157 --> 11:41.117
This guy?

11:41.784 --> 11:42.618
Me?

11:43.452 --> 11:44.912
[scoffing dramatically]

11:45.621 --> 11:47.248
Presentations need showmanship,

11:47.331 --> 11:50.418
so what you're sensing is my focus,
Team Leader Yun.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.380
I won't be blandly reading
like some presentation amateur.

11:55.089 --> 11:58.467
I intend to be humorous also.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.847
And treat our honored guests
with cocktails and delicious food as well.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.517
This guarantees our company
their full support.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.353
You get it, right? Hmm?

12:19.655 --> 12:21.907
[nervously] Hello, Mr. Kro… [gulps]

12:25.536 --> 12:31.000
I'm the proud director of… of Kronoid.
Kim Sang-hoon is my name.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.880
Please enjoy the show.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.468
Ah.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.137
[computer beeping]

12:48.642 --> 12:51.228
- [Sang-hoon in video] <i>Year 2135.</i>
- [dramatic music playing]

12:51.312 --> 12:55.566
<i>The rising sea level, depletion</i>
<i>of resources, and the pollution of Earth</i>

12:55.649 --> 12:58.903
<i>forced mankind</i>
<i>to look for a new way to survive.</i>

13:00.070 --> 13:03.115
<i>Humankind found refuge from</i>
<i>the uninhabitable environment</i>

13:03.199 --> 13:05.409
<i>in shelters they built in space.</i>

13:05.493 --> 13:07.453
<i>However, only a short time later,</i>

13:07.536 --> 13:14.502
<i>space shelters number 8, 12, and 13</i>
<i>declared themselves the Adrian Republic,</i>

13:15.294 --> 13:19.673
<i>which started a civil war that threatened</i>
<i>Earth and peaceful life in the shelters.</i>

13:19.757 --> 13:22.051
I did the narration on this myself.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.680
[narration] <i>And this war</i>
<i>between the Allied Force</i>

13:26.764 --> 13:30.851
<i>and the Adrian has been</i>
<i>going on for the last 40 years.</i>

13:31.852 --> 13:34.772
I put this edit together
and I also picked the music.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.066
- Whoo-whoo!
- [narration] <i>…combat AIs for the war.</i>

13:37.775 --> 13:40.444
<i>Founded in the year 2130 CE,</i>

13:40.528 --> 13:43.030
<i>with a team of top researchers utilizing…</i>

13:43.113 --> 13:46.158
We know this already.
How about we get to the point?

13:46.242 --> 13:47.243
All right.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.120
Just go on, skip it. Skip it.
Skip to the end.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.043
[narration] <i>…legendary mercenary</i>
<i>of the Adrian Civil War.</i>

13:56.126 --> 13:57.336
<i>The pride of Korea.</i>

<i>Captain Yun Jung-yi.</i>

14:00.214 --> 14:04.677

14:04.760 --> 14:07.137
<i>After countless successful missions,</i>

14:07.221 --> 14:10.641
<i>she secured her place</i>
<i>as the war's greatest hero.</i>

14:11.475 --> 14:13.435
Shall I fast-forward more for you?

14:16.188 --> 14:17.773
[narration] <i>Thirty-five years ago,</i>

14:17.857 --> 14:19.692
<i>Captain Yun Jung-yi joined the mission</i>

14:19.775 --> 14:23.821
<i>to blow up a fuel rod</i>
<i>in Adrian's Shelter B-25.</i>

14:23.904 --> 14:28.158
<i>But the mission was a failure</i>
<i>and she ended up in a coma.</i>

14:28.993 --> 14:31.495
<i>Kronoid, with permission from her family,</i>

14:31.579 --> 14:35.457
<i>spared no expense on state-of-the-art</i>
<i>treatments to keep her alive,</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:39.044
<i>then mapped her neural cortex</i>
<i>and converted it to data.</i>

14:39.628 --> 14:43.674
<i>With this, we will develop</i>
<i>the most advanced combat command AI ever,</i>

14:43.757 --> 14:46.468
<i>equipped with the tactical</i>
<i>and combat skills of Jung-yi,</i>

14:46.552 --> 14:49.471
<i>as well as her great loyalty</i>
<i>and determination.</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:50.431
Yes.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.727
This new program is aptly named "JUNG_E."

14:54.810 --> 14:56.020
[dramatic music ends]

14:56.103 --> 14:59.398
We developed it so that
the spirit of Captain Yun would live on.

15:02.318 --> 15:06.071
Ah. The daughter of Captain…
The daughter of legendary Captain Yun,

15:06.155 --> 15:08.866
Dr. Yun Seo-hyun,
is leading the project's team.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.494
And now,
I'll allow the team leader to explain.

15:12.995 --> 15:13.954
You're up.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.707
Don't be nervous, okay?

15:16.790 --> 15:19.209
Whoo! Whoo! [coughs awkwardly]

15:32.306 --> 15:35.935
I'd like to show you the data
copied from Ms. Yun's brain.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.687
We are developing an AI

15:38.771 --> 15:41.982
comprised of the real-life Captain Yun
on her final mission,

15:42.066 --> 15:44.902
focusing on her combat skills
and experience

15:45.486 --> 15:48.197
using the data collected from her brain.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.950
[beeping]

15:51.617 --> 15:53.035
[panting]

15:53.661 --> 15:54.828
To achieve this,

15:54.912 --> 15:58.874
the android operating from the collected
brain data completes a simulation.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.211
The behavioral pattern
is stored and analyzed.

16:05.214 --> 16:11.136
From our simulations, we have activated
the network of neural pathways shown here.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.599
[inhaling] Hang on.
The pathways should be in green instead.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.019
Because our projects are so easy
to green-light. You know?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.020
[mimics bell ringing]

16:20.771 --> 16:21.689
Can you be serious?

16:23.607 --> 16:25.234
That was one of my jokes.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.280
We will use a simulation
to isolate these areas of the brain,

16:30.364 --> 16:33.033
and extract the combat memory data.

16:33.867 --> 16:38.789
The goal here is to create an AI
with unmatched performance.

16:38.872 --> 16:39.999
So, how did it do?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.918
Did the robot escape in the simulation?

16:45.337 --> 16:46.505
Not at the moment.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.340
We have to remember,

16:49.008 --> 16:51.552
if Yun Jung-yi completed
the final mission,

16:51.635 --> 16:53.387
we would have won the war.

16:54.138 --> 16:59.059
Her failure is why the Adrian Civil War
is still going on after 40 years.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.353
The Korean mercenary…

17:02.396 --> 17:04.064
She was popular at the time.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.734
But sentiments have changed.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.694
A lot of citizens
think she's the main reason

17:08.777 --> 17:12.031
the Adrian Civil War
has dragged on for so long.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.825
Ah, that is still up for debate.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.162
Still, our combat AI is an improvement.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.290
We are only taking the greatest parts
of Captain Yun

17:21.373 --> 17:23.751
and extracting it all to be used--

17:23.834 --> 17:27.588
Then why does it keep failing to escape
when it's in the battle simulation?

17:28.589 --> 17:32.468
Why on earth would you model
a combat AI off her?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.345
I would prefer a soldier
who can complete the mission instead.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.263
[Dr. Yun] She will.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.892
I am certain.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.437
Captain Yun Jung-yi will succeed in her
original mission very soon.

17:44.271 --> 17:46.565
On that, you have my word. Furthermore…

17:47.232 --> 17:50.611
Her lost glory as an Allied Forces hero

17:50.694 --> 17:51.820
will be reclaimed.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.365
[sighs deeply]

18:00.621 --> 18:02.623
[classical string music playing]

18:19.556 --> 18:20.641
[beeping]

18:24.436 --> 18:25.354
Whoo!

18:26.522 --> 18:28.690
That's an original Park Ho.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.526
Yun Jung-yi warrior edition.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.819
Beautiful, right?

18:32.945 --> 18:35.239
Speaking of beautiful,
look at that sunset.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.281
[sucks in breath]

18:36.782 --> 18:37.699
[gasps]

18:39.201 --> 18:40.494
You came early.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.247
It's adorable.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.543
I learned that the people of the past

18:47.626 --> 18:51.380
thought that a product's design
was just as valuable as its usefulness.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.800
And that would make sense
in a time of such abundance.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.426
Right.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.680
I really admire the passion
you showed them.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.931
[exclaiming proudly]

19:01.014 --> 19:02.975
Unbelievable passion, really.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.061
Those geezers were overwhelmed.

19:06.728 --> 19:09.439
You pretty much sealed the deal
for the project.

19:10.607 --> 19:14.611
They pulled me aside and said it's
a green light if we clear the simulation.

19:15.112 --> 19:16.155
That's good news.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.866
Please, have a seat.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.286
Cold brew, Doctor?

19:22.911 --> 19:24.496
Only the best from the past.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.497
No, thank you.

19:26.290 --> 19:29.001
I'm processing 17
before we destroy the data.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.544
Processing them?

19:30.627 --> 19:31.461
Hmm.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.214
Do you find that that's valuable,

19:34.798 --> 19:35.757
Team Leader Yun?

19:36.592 --> 19:39.094
Does it help us define the brain analysis?

19:40.387 --> 19:41.305
Good question.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.641
Having more information
improves our chances.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.186
Mm-mm-mmm.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.524
For you.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.401
I hope you feel accomplished.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.237
The greatest thing we've built
is in your mother's name,

19:57.321 --> 20:00.365
and it might bring an end to the war!
[chuckles]

20:01.366 --> 20:03.285
It's the chairman's victory.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.247
[sighs]

20:09.958 --> 20:12.544
Wow, he truly is a great man.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.215
The chairman and you
go back a long time, right?

20:16.798 --> 20:20.177
It's only been ten years
since I've started working for him.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.097
You've known him since you were young
because of the history with your mother.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.644
Well, it's more like
he's looked after me since I was young.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.980
The JUNG_E project is definitely back on.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.899
Forget what that old fart said before.

20:35.442 --> 20:40.197
Captain Yun Jung-yi was easily
the greatest combat soldier in her day.

20:40.822 --> 20:44.201
She only failed in that one
measly mission. [mimics people blabbing]

20:45.327 --> 20:46.495
He's just jealous.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.247
He wants to be beloved.

20:49.081 --> 20:53.126
The only reason your mother is still alive
is because of our great chairman,

20:53.210 --> 20:55.837
who has expectations for the project
that are so high

20:55.921 --> 20:58.715
that I…[exaggerated crying]
I get emotional.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.177
You have my full support.

21:03.887 --> 21:05.138
Don't worry, Director.

21:06.265 --> 21:09.101
And now… I really must go.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.436
- To begin processing.
- Oh yes, of course.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.021
Uh.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.399
The chairman will be visiting any day.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.858
So keep up the good work.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.485
Go get 'em!

21:23.115 --> 21:25.325

21:59.818 --> 22:02.612
Ms. Yun, just relax now please.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.115
- [grunting]
- Ms. Yun, can you hear me?

22:05.198 --> 22:07.826
The mic is working, right?
I think she can hear me.

22:07.909 --> 22:09.077
Ms. Yun?

22:32.142 --> 22:33.393
[JUNG_E panting]

22:33.477 --> 22:35.103
Now let's calm down and talk.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.564
What am I? I can't feel my body.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.068
Listen, just stay calm, okay?

22:41.151 --> 22:44.029
- Um, uh, Ms… Ms. Yun?
- Where… Where am I? Where am I?

22:44.112 --> 22:47.115
What have you done?
I don't… I don't understand!

22:50.410 --> 22:52.996
Let me go, you monsters!
What in the hell have you done?

22:54.122 --> 22:56.083
I think she's unresponsive. [chuckles]

22:58.210 --> 22:59.211
I'll get you bastards!

22:59.294 --> 23:00.253

23:00.337 --> 23:02.547

Destroy the brain. Unable to process.

[clunking, powering down]

23:38.250 --> 23:40.252
[electronic trilling]

24:00.105 --> 24:03.275
[man] It seems like a waste
to destroy them every time, though.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.736
You did well, for your first time.

24:06.820 --> 24:09.656
[chuckles modestly] Really?
I didn't really do all that much.

24:09.739 --> 24:10.824
[laughs]

24:17.956 --> 24:21.126
[Dr. Yun] So I hear
you wanted to move to our team.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.294
Ah, yes.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.963
Truth be told,
I'm a big fan of Captain Yun.

24:25.046 --> 24:29.050
[laughs] When I was young,
she was a real-life superhero.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.094
[Dr. Yun chuckles] Superhero?

24:32.888 --> 24:36.141
The real reason
that my mother kept fighting in the war,

24:36.224 --> 24:37.893
it was to help me.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.311
Sorry?

24:41.188 --> 24:42.522
When I was young,

24:43.523 --> 24:45.692
they found a tumor in my lungs.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.988
The treatments were expensive, and…

24:51.323 --> 24:52.491
we were poor.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.745
To help pay for my treatments,

24:56.828 --> 24:58.747
my mother became a mercenary.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.499
[sighs]

25:00.582 --> 25:05.212
I was terrified that one day,
my mother would die fighting in the war,

25:06.630 --> 25:08.632
trying to save my life with hers.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.134
Every time she fought, I cried.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.719
Hmm.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.263
The day I got the surgery…

25:16.973 --> 25:19.434
was the last day she went into action.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.102
Ah…

25:21.186 --> 25:22.896
I always wondered…

25:24.814 --> 25:28.818
does my mother regret
sacrificing her life to save her daughter?

25:29.486 --> 25:31.905
And does she resent me because of it?

25:34.199 --> 25:36.034
[inhaling sharply]
So why haven't you asked?

25:36.117 --> 25:37.536
[melancholy music playing]

25:37.619 --> 25:39.037
What?

25:39.120 --> 25:41.039
There in processing, you could ask.

25:41.122 --> 25:43.792
If it fails a simulation,
you could ask it then.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.710
If it ever resented its daughter.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.420
[inhaling sharply] You're right.

25:48.797 --> 25:49.965
I could do that.

25:50.048 --> 25:51.007
Yeah.

25:53.093 --> 25:56.846
Excuse me, Jae-kyung,
I have the ethics test today.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.933
So please finish up the report
on 17's processing.

26:00.016 --> 26:02.936
[groaning] Oh, the ethics test.
Yes, ma'am.

26:03.728 --> 26:04.563
Hm.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.610
Thank you, ma'am. For sharing your story.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.488
Honestly, she really was my hero!
[laughs awkwardly]

26:13.572 --> 26:15.615
Don't be scared to tell me more!

26:16.908 --> 26:17.742
Hoo!

26:18.326 --> 26:19.494
[chuckles excitedly]

26:21.204 --> 26:23.081

27:09.794 --> 27:11.087

27:11.880 --> 27:13.089
- Thank you.
- Here.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.175
[civilians continue chattering]

27:41.493 --> 27:44.204
[girl] Mom, you'll come back. Right?

27:44.788 --> 27:48.083
Of course. Now you be good,
and listen to auntie while you're there.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.085
[sniffles]

27:52.379 --> 27:54.255
[mother] Don't cry, it's nothing.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.884
- Come on. Don't cry.
- [train braking]

27:58.635 --> 28:00.887
[mother] It's not like
you won't see me again.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.639
Okay?

28:08.061 --> 28:09.104
Seo-hyun.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.482
Mommy has to go on another mission.

28:13.358 --> 28:16.695
So I can't be at your side
when they perform the surgery, honey.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.614
You have to stay strong, okay?

28:19.698 --> 28:21.241
You're mom's brave girl, right?

28:21.324 --> 28:22.242
Yeah?

28:22.325 --> 28:24.327
[melancholy music continues]

28:25.578 --> 28:26.413
Ma…

28:28.206 --> 28:29.999
will you hurry back?

28:30.583 --> 28:32.377
After the surgery, will you be here?

28:33.002 --> 28:34.963
Oh, of course.

28:35.046 --> 28:38.633
I'll be gone, but honey,
I swear I'll come back in no time.

28:39.217 --> 28:42.345
When I finish the mission,
I will be right by your side.

28:43.012 --> 28:44.305
All right, sweetie?

28:47.434 --> 28:49.853
Now give me a lucky cheek rub, okay?

28:50.437 --> 28:52.147
[chuckles] Yeah.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.274
[sighs] I love my girl.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.485
- [laughs]
- My baby.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.239
[both sigh]

29:03.700 --> 29:05.243
[both laugh contentedly]

29:11.666 --> 29:13.126
We'll take good care of her.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.216
[playful growl]

29:20.300 --> 29:21.426
[both laugh]

29:21.509 --> 29:24.095
[Captain Yun] I'll see you soon.
You can do it. Okay? Okay?

[woman] <i>This is the eighth ethics test of</i>
<i>Team Leader Yun Seo-hyun of Kronoid Lab.</i>

29:57.629 --> 30:00.757
<i>Ms. Yun, have you ever had a pet?</i>

30:01.925 --> 30:02.884
I have not.

30:02.967 --> 30:06.429
[woman] <i>Have you ever felt attached</i>
<i>to a product or an object?</i>

30:07.347 --> 30:10.517
- Yes.
<i>- Have you ever named the object?</i>

30:10.600 --> 30:11.476
Yes.

30:11.559 --> 30:13.561
[woman] <i>Have you ever composed poetry</i>

30:13.645 --> 30:16.272
<i>longer than three lines</i>
<i>looking at the sunset?</i>

30:16.356 --> 30:17.524
Yes.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.859
<i>Have you ever bought an original artwork</i>

30:19.943 --> 30:23.696
<i>at a price that is</i>
<i>too expensive for your means?</i>

30:24.656 --> 30:25.740
I have not.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.536
[doctor] Okay, the test results will be
sent to the company in two to three days.

30:30.203 --> 30:33.248
More importantly, the cancer has
metastasized from the location

30:33.331 --> 30:36.167
where you previously had surgery.
I'm afraid it's not good news.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.963
Ms. Yun, the cancer
has spread to your major organs.

30:40.046 --> 30:44.467
As I told you before, this area here
will inevitably continue to spread.

30:44.551 --> 30:46.803
It's impossible
to perform surgery at this point.

30:46.886 --> 30:47.720
[hollow laugh]

30:48.221 --> 30:50.139
It was always going to happen.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.935
That surgery I got as a kid
was for nothing.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.019
[doctor] Pardon?

30:55.728 --> 30:56.646
It's nothing.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.481
Doctor…

30:59.983 --> 31:01.568
how much time do I have now?

31:02.443 --> 31:03.695
You have three months.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.240
The best course of action

31:07.323 --> 31:09.117
would be to copy your brain right away

31:09.200 --> 31:11.160
and transfer over to a prosthetic body.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.290
These days,
the law guarantees equal human rights

31:15.373 --> 31:17.375
to those who choose this procedure.

31:17.458 --> 31:19.085
Assuming you choose Type A.

31:19.168 --> 31:21.921
But it does come at a steep price.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.047
Type A.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.842
It's too steep for me.

31:25.925 --> 31:29.304
It includes a cerebral storage backup
before we transfer the brain.

31:29.387 --> 31:33.641
Also secures your human rights
and covers a single body prosthetic.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.811
There are other options available,
like Type B,

31:36.895 --> 31:39.480
but rights like marriage,
freedom of movement,

31:39.564 --> 31:41.482
and adoption are prohibited.

31:41.566 --> 31:45.528
With Type B, the government requires
compliance that you will allow them

31:45.612 --> 31:47.030
to access your brain data.

31:47.697 --> 31:51.659
And then, if both of those options
are too much, there's Type C.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.202
- And that--
- With Type C,

31:53.286 --> 31:55.663
you don't get treated
as a human being at all.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.874
Honestly, it's really not all that bad.

31:57.957 --> 31:59.584
The main difference with Type C

31:59.667 --> 32:01.961
is you surrender ownership
of your brain data,

32:02.045 --> 32:03.922
allowing certified companies to own it.

32:04.005 --> 32:07.133
And since countless clones
will be created with it,

32:07.216 --> 32:10.637
you will no longer be an individual,
so that is…

32:11.638 --> 32:13.598
The main upside being,

32:14.140 --> 32:17.185
the Type C prosthetic
is free of charge though.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.938
A data use credit
covers the transfer amount.

32:20.521 --> 32:23.900
The contract your mother,
Captain Yun Jung-yi, signed with Kronoid

32:23.983 --> 32:25.234
was for Type C.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.071
Let me think about it.

32:29.405 --> 32:32.533
Since I'm here,
I hope to see my mother before I go.

32:33.117 --> 32:34.369
Yeah, please, of course.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.579
And I'm always close by
if you have any questions.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.081
Thanks.

32:41.834 --> 32:42.835
[powering down]

33:01.396 --> 33:03.398
[thunder rumbling]

33:04.649 --> 33:06.818
[somber music playing]

33:08.444 --> 33:10.446
[man] Ms. Yun barely made it out alive.

33:10.530 --> 33:12.490
She's in critical condition.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.118
But you must decide right away,

33:15.201 --> 33:17.870
before her cerebral cortex is damaged.

33:19.789 --> 33:21.874
There's still time to save the brain.

33:25.878 --> 33:26.838
[sighs]

33:27.338 --> 33:28.798
If you choose to sign the agreement,

33:29.841 --> 33:31.676
we'll cover Ms. Yun's treatment

33:31.759 --> 33:35.471
and her daughter Seo-hyun's
education and living expenses.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.684
Please place your palm here
when you've looked it over.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.060
[sobbing]

33:47.734 --> 33:49.277
[whimpering]

33:50.778 --> 33:52.238
With Ms. Yun's brain data,

33:52.321 --> 33:55.742
we can make a product
that will end this war, once and for all.

33:55.825 --> 33:59.370
We'll let the company know that you agreed
to go forth with the project.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.833
And I'll make sure that the money
for your living expenses is sent soon.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.668
Hi there, Seo-hyun.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.215
Guess what?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.343
I have a present for you.

34:20.224 --> 34:24.062
Your mom will be a hero forever.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.314
Would you like that, Seo-hyun?

34:29.776 --> 34:30.610
[sniffles]

34:36.616 --> 34:38.618
[thunder rumbling

Eighteen is good to go.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.415
How's our connection?

36:07.498 --> 36:09.333
The connection looks good, Team Leader.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.503
[chuckling]

36:14.839 --> 36:15.840
[exhales deeply]

36:23.347 --> 36:24.807
[woman] Number 18 is in place.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.225
- Min-jae.
- Yes?

36:26.309 --> 36:29.353
- Labs A, B, and C, double check them.
- Yes, ma'am.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.689
Can you repeat those number again?

36:48.539 --> 36:50.625
A clear check on all numbers.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.253
The docking is complete.

36:54.921 --> 36:55.755
[man] Okay.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.673
Prepping simulation.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.345
[snapping] Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:03.346 --> 37:04.764
[sighs]

37:04.847 --> 37:07.016
Isn't it time we try something different?

37:08.643 --> 37:10.853
Let's shoot it through
the leg before starting.

37:10.937 --> 37:12.230

37:12.313 --> 37:14.315

RAIL GUN CONTROLS

37:33.334 --> 37:36.879
Doing the simulation the same each time
is only slowing us down.

37:37.588 --> 37:38.464
Go ahead.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.300
Now we can begin the simulation.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.136
[music ends]

PAIN LEVEL INCREASING

38:09.495 --> 38:12.373
The same thing happened when 17 was shot.

38:12.456 --> 38:14.667
This is the neural area for pain.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.837
I want you to color the pain area red.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.422
Change it to strawberry.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.384
Humor. Humor.

38:24.093 --> 38:26.262
[sighing] I'll show you strawberry.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.401
Her red is spreading rapidly.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.029
I fear this one is over.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.408
Great. That was disappointing.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.415
[panting]

39:39.585 --> 39:41.003
[woman] Something is happening.

What happened?

39:52.973 --> 39:54.058
[JUNG_E yelling]

39:54.141 --> 39:56.143
- What part is that?
- [woman] One second. I'll check.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.520
[grunting]

39:59.271 --> 40:02.066
[woman] The mobility here's higher
than the green brainwave signal.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.026
[man] It's a new area.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.239

[panting]

40:18.624 --> 40:19.792
[gunshot]

40:20.793 --> 40:22.211
No, no, not the head!

40:23.295 --> 40:25.256
Now that brain is useless.

40:25.339 --> 40:26.549
[inhaling angrily]

40:28.426 --> 40:30.594
[shouting] Hurry up!
Go in there and retrieve it!

40:30.678 --> 40:32.847
- I need to see the replay.
- Yes, sir.

40:34.098 --> 40:36.434
There, which part was that?

40:37.476 --> 40:38.686
[man] Analyzing now.

40:39.478 --> 40:40.729
UNIDENTIFIED AREA INCREASING

40:41.313 --> 40:43.441
That's a new area of activation.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.401
It's something, right?

40:46.902 --> 40:50.781
Well, from what I see,
we just found our combat AI.

40:52.324 --> 40:53.993
The color should be…

40:54.076 --> 40:55.703
yellow as a pineapple.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.288
[yelling] Huh? You hear me?

40:57.371 --> 40:58.372
[sigh]

A pineapple.

41:07.423 --> 41:11.093
I need you at 100%.
The HQ briefing is tomorrow.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.325
[suspenseful music playing]

41:59.099 --> 42:00.226
[Sang-hoon] Kronoid.

42:00.309 --> 42:03.187
The director of Kronoid.

42:03.812 --> 42:07.691
Hello, I'm Kim Sang-hoon,
the director of Kronoid Laboratory.

42:07.775 --> 42:08.609
Hm.

42:09.318 --> 42:10.402
[chuckles]

42:11.570 --> 42:14.698
[automated announcement] <i>We will soon</i>

[music fades out]

42:36.971 --> 42:40.432
[automated announcement]
<i>Welcome, everyone, to Kronoid HQ.</i>

42:40.516 --> 42:43.477
<i>Under the vision</i>
<i>of moving forward into the future,</i>

42:43.561 --> 42:47.565
<i>Kronoid is endeavoring to develop</i>
<i>technology in diverse areas</i>

42:47.648 --> 42:51.110
<i>and provide quality experiences</i>
<i>so that future generations can…</i>

42:51.193 --> 42:52.987
Has the chairman arrived yet?

42:53.070 --> 42:54.405
[woman] I'll check, sir.

42:54.488 --> 42:57.283
[laughing]

42:58.617 --> 42:59.952
[laughing continues]

43:03.455 --> 43:05.082
His schedule was full today.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.211
How are you? You're Director Kim.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.716
Lee Se-yeon, Managing Director.

43:13.799 --> 43:16.135
I'm the new head of Kronoid's
Product Development Department.

43:16.218 --> 43:18.512
It's so nice to finally meet.

43:22.057 --> 43:22.933
Okay.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.603
The chairman won't be here?

43:26.186 --> 43:28.856
Won't he want to receive an update
on the research we've done?

43:28.939 --> 43:31.400
He's asked me
to see your presentation instead.

43:31.483 --> 43:34.028
And I assure you,
I will relay the information.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.613
This comes from the chairman?

43:37.990 --> 43:39.158
[chuckles awkwardly]

43:39.867 --> 43:41.535
Could you tell me your name one more time?

43:41.619 --> 43:44.163
Lee Se-yeon, as I said before.

43:44.246 --> 43:45.873
I'm the head of product development here--

43:45.956 --> 43:47.124
[yelling]

43:47.625 --> 43:50.711
Since when do we have
a product development department?

43:53.464 --> 43:57.343
Kronoid's a military AI development firm.
What products are you working on?

43:58.385 --> 43:59.219
[titters]

43:59.720 --> 44:03.474
[laughs heartily]

44:05.100 --> 44:06.727
It's so funny.

44:07.895 --> 44:10.564
You can't hide your feelings either.
Am I right, huh?

44:10.648 --> 44:12.775
[laughs]

44:14.735 --> 44:15.819
Pardon me?

44:15.903 --> 44:17.905
Oh, never mind.

44:17.988 --> 44:21.784
Due to a conflict, unfortunately
the chairman can't be here.

44:21.867 --> 44:23.744
However, I'm excited to see it.

44:23.827 --> 44:26.455
He said he'll be
visiting the lab very soon.

44:26.538 --> 44:29.416
Don't worry. No need to be nervous, hm?

44:42.054 --> 44:42.971
[hissing]

44:44.765 --> 44:46.767
[tense music playing]

45:08.163 --> 45:10.749
Such simple minds.

45:11.333 --> 45:16.380
After all the money the chairman invested
in developing a combat AI,

45:17.214 --> 45:19.758
they're going to downsize
weapons development now?

45:21.677 --> 45:23.679
I will keep his dream alive.

45:26.849 --> 45:27.808
Don't you agree?

45:29.309 --> 45:31.603
That vapid woman knows nothing.

45:33.731 --> 45:36.150
Knows nothing about the chairman.

45:37.276 --> 45:39.820
Nothing at all.

45:49.788 --> 45:51.165
[tense music ends]

46:11.477 --> 46:13.687
It's pretty cool, right? Look.

46:14.188 --> 46:18.525
Yes. This latest version is a marked
upgrade from the previous test body.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.362
So how well
do the AI implement the yellow area?

46:23.280 --> 46:25.282
The test version mapped it well.

46:25.365 --> 46:27.451
After today, we'll know more.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.454
I'm so excited! So excited!

46:33.999 --> 46:34.958
Director!

46:35.709 --> 46:38.170
The chairman has just arrived.
He's in your office.

46:38.253 --> 46:39.963
He's here? I'm on my way.

46:40.547 --> 46:41.632
Oh…

46:41.715 --> 46:45.010
Is it okay if I take this one?
I think the chairman would like it.

46:45.719 --> 46:47.179
Go ahead. Of course.

46:47.262 --> 46:48.263
Team Leader.

46:52.059 --> 46:53.101
<i>Team Leader Yun.</i>

46:54.019 --> 46:56.355
When did you last take the ethics test?

46:57.481 --> 46:58.774
The ethics test?

46:59.358 --> 47:03.111
You know, the test that
identifies humans from our friend here.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.823
A couple of days ago.

47:06.406 --> 47:08.158
I make it a point to never skip it.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.535
[laugh]

47:09.618 --> 47:11.245
The chairman was wondering.

47:11.787 --> 47:15.582
He must be worried about it
because Yun Jung-yi was your mother.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.168
He's very thorough man.

47:18.794 --> 47:21.004
The chairman as alway--
[electronic beeping]

47:22.339 --> 47:23.924
[whirring]

47:27.219 --> 47:28.136
[gasping softly]

47:33.225 --> 47:35.686
[giggling] Surprise.

47:35.769 --> 47:36.979
[giggling]

47:38.397 --> 47:39.898
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

47:40.566 --> 47:43.110
What brings you here?
We weren't expecting you.

47:43.694 --> 47:47.322
I came to check on the operations
of our lab, among other things.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.283
And I have news for you.

47:50.075 --> 47:52.619
The JUNG_E AI is close to being completed.

47:53.203 --> 47:56.707
We are currently verifying
previously unknown neural sectors.

47:56.790 --> 47:59.668
- A final simulation will--
- Yeah, yeah, the combat AI.

48:00.168 --> 48:03.213
HQ has the combat AI data already.

48:03.297 --> 48:05.799
Our head researchers
have made improvements.

48:06.758 --> 48:07.593
[Dr. Yun] Oh…

48:08.218 --> 48:09.595
Of course, sir.

48:09.678 --> 48:12.264
We'll do our best here as well.

48:12.848 --> 48:13.974
[chairman] Seo-hyun.

48:15.934 --> 48:17.603
It's not necessary anymore.

48:19.396 --> 48:22.274
- Sir?
- The age of weapon contracting is over.

48:22.357 --> 48:25.319
It looks like
the Adrian Civil War is coming to an end.

48:26.862 --> 48:30.407
There's a treaty between the Allied Force
and the Adrian Republic.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.994
I remember the old munition companies.

48:34.077 --> 48:35.996
They all did the same thing.

48:36.079 --> 48:38.999
They made heaters
from all their raw materials.

48:39.499 --> 48:42.294
[sighs] We will do now as they did then.

48:44.296 --> 48:46.924
Our research up to this point
wasn't useless.

48:47.925 --> 48:52.554
The massive strides in brain replication
allowed us to explore other sectors.

48:54.598 --> 48:55.599
Combat AI?

48:56.308 --> 48:58.894
[chuckles] Won't serve us
on the road ahead.

48:59.478 --> 49:03.106
We need to develop housekeeping
and service worker AIs now.

49:04.107 --> 49:05.067
Tell me…

49:05.692 --> 49:08.695
was Captain Yun experienced
at something other than combat?

49:08.779 --> 49:10.739
Because that would prove useful.

49:11.990 --> 49:14.451
So our time here at the lab…

49:15.118 --> 49:16.370
is coming to an end?

49:16.453 --> 49:18.538
Uh-huh, so use your time wisely.

49:24.544 --> 49:25.545
It's depressing.

49:27.339 --> 49:29.049
I know it all too well.

49:30.050 --> 49:33.011
I used to be obsessed
with brain replication.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.016
[groans] Rich people like me
seem to think about nothing else.

49:39.226 --> 49:42.270
The moment that brain replication
was discovered,

49:42.354 --> 49:43.981
my first thought was…

49:46.066 --> 49:48.318
"Yeah, now I can live forever."

49:49.111 --> 49:50.612
I really thought so.

49:51.905 --> 49:53.657
So my first experiment

49:53.740 --> 49:55.575
was brain replication.

49:55.659 --> 49:58.286
To create a version of me
that was immortal.

50:00.747 --> 50:02.624
It led to my first robot.

50:05.252 --> 50:06.712
Prototype Sang here.

50:07.295 --> 50:08.338
[laughs]

50:09.965 --> 50:11.258
And then it happened.

50:11.341 --> 50:13.427
After the brain replication,

50:13.510 --> 50:16.221
I had to transfer over and couldn't do it.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.181
You know why?

50:22.144 --> 50:25.439
This guy right here. This wire shell.

50:26.565 --> 50:27.649
It didn't feel real.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.194
It's alien.

50:33.572 --> 50:35.282
It just ends up being hollow.

50:35.365 --> 50:37.117
No matter how close we get.

50:40.954 --> 50:42.205
It's like…

50:42.998 --> 50:45.667
having your mom's voice
on an electric rice cooker.

50:46.334 --> 50:47.878
[imitating steam]

50:47.961 --> 50:51.131
"Honey, come get your rice.
I made it just for you."

50:54.676 --> 50:57.888
A robot can't make it like Mom's rice,
I can guarantee you that.

50:58.889 --> 50:59.723
Huh?

51:01.600 --> 51:02.684
It's not funny?

51:03.935 --> 51:07.314
I'm just joking. Joking. [laughs]

51:11.568 --> 51:12.527
Sir, if I may,

51:13.111 --> 51:15.238
allow my mother's project to go on.

51:15.322 --> 51:18.075
- Give us the opportunity to finish--
- There's no need.

51:19.493 --> 51:20.994
The project is already done.

51:22.871 --> 51:24.539
After you wrap it all up,

51:25.957 --> 51:28.543
switch over to household android AIs.

51:29.711 --> 51:31.630
I'll tell Sang-hoon that too.

51:32.422 --> 51:34.132
He'll most likely be a wreck.

51:35.967 --> 51:38.804
He's the type
who won't easily admit to failure.

51:39.930 --> 51:41.723
I know that better than anyone.

51:44.851 --> 51:47.062
Be nice to him, even if he's on edge.

51:49.314 --> 51:52.943
I'm going to dispose of him anyway,
once the project is wrapped up.

51:53.985 --> 51:56.113
I'm going to talk to Sang-hoon all right.

51:56.863 --> 51:58.448
Understand? Hm?

52:00.492 --> 52:03.120
Seo-hyun, give up this obsession.

52:06.706 --> 52:07.874
…always two steps--

52:08.750 --> 52:11.044
Hello, chairman, when did you arrive?

52:11.920 --> 52:13.797
Did my portrait birth you here?

52:14.631 --> 52:17.717
[stifled laughter]

52:17.801 --> 52:22.472
[laughing hysterically]

52:22.556 --> 52:25.767
Sang-hoon,
your sense of humor is the best.

52:25.851 --> 52:27.144
In all of Adrian.

52:27.227 --> 52:29.146
[continues laughing]

52:30.230 --> 52:33.358
- That is all. Goodbye. [laughing]
- Aren't you going to speak to both of us?

52:33.441 --> 52:35.861
Oh, I saw her. That's good enough.

52:35.944 --> 52:37.904
Now, enough joking around.

52:37.988 --> 52:41.158
- Fill me in on JUNG_E.
- Yes, sir. This is our latest prototype…

52:41.825 --> 52:44.494
- Yes, you did well, you did.
- [Sang-hoon mimicking robotic beeping]

52:45.829 --> 52:46.955
[grunting]

52:59.134 --> 53:00.302
[grunting]

53:00.886 --> 53:02.512
- [buzzer sounding]
- [yelling] Why!

53:04.431 --> 53:08.643
How come she always dies in the exact
same place! [shouting hysterically]

53:13.648 --> 53:16.067
During the simulation,
did the brain show any yellow?

53:16.568 --> 53:17.736
[clears throat]

53:17.819 --> 53:18.695
No, sir.

53:19.321 --> 53:22.157
Sorry. It hasn't showed up
since that first time.

53:22.240 --> 53:25.076
After all these tries,
you've failed to isolate the area?

53:26.077 --> 53:28.455
We are limited by the current technology.

53:28.538 --> 53:31.791
It will take a while.
The process is complicated.

53:32.375 --> 53:33.418
Team Leader Yun.

53:34.419 --> 53:37.130
Are you happy with
how the AI is progressing?

53:38.131 --> 53:40.091
[man] Um, Director, uh…

53:40.717 --> 53:42.677
[clears throat] Sir, uh, Kronoid HQ,

53:42.761 --> 53:45.305
they seem satisfied with how the current
combat AI is performing…

53:45.388 --> 53:48.225
Well, I'm not, all right?
[yelling] I'm not satisfied!

53:51.770 --> 53:54.522
Did you know HQ is trying to
haphazardly wrap up our project?

53:55.023 --> 53:57.025
[sighs] They're clearly
disappointed in us,

53:57.108 --> 53:59.236
and now all of you want
to prove them right?

54:03.698 --> 54:05.617
Get it to Termination Advisory.

54:06.201 --> 54:09.204
We will isolate this mysterious area
at any cost.

54:11.623 --> 54:12.540
Ah.

54:13.792 --> 54:16.253
Keep the arms and legs. I want 22 whole.

54:17.754 --> 54:18.588
Yes, sir.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.466
[Sang-hoon muttering] Unbelievable.

54:21.549 --> 54:22.968
[door closes]

54:27.847 --> 54:29.057
Hello, Director.

54:31.101 --> 54:32.519
Suspend motor functions.

54:33.603 --> 54:34.521
Yes, sir.

54:36.898 --> 54:38.400
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

54:40.568 --> 54:41.528
Turn it on.

54:42.737 --> 54:43.738
Yes, sir.

54:46.032 --> 54:48.118

55:07.220 --> 55:10.265
Who are you people? Who are you?

55:11.099 --> 55:12.142
Cut off its arm.

55:12.225 --> 55:13.268
[man] Sorry?

55:13.351 --> 55:16.146
- Um… Um, like… Um, cut?
- [ominous music playing]

55:16.938 --> 55:18.189
Did I stutter?

55:18.940 --> 55:23.486
Cut the arm off. The arm.
[yelling] Arm, arm, arm, arm, arm, arm!

55:24.237 --> 55:25.822
Yes, sir. I'm on it.

55:27.115 --> 55:28.491
[sighs]

55:32.370 --> 55:33.997
[JUNG_E] Who are you people?

55:34.706 --> 55:36.666
What is this? [gasping]

55:36.750 --> 55:38.835
[saw whirring]

55:41.880 --> 55:43.173

56:05.487 --> 56:06.863
The yellow part?

56:08.239 --> 56:10.408
[man] No, sir.
That area is not responding.

56:12.577 --> 56:13.495
Uh…

56:14.829 --> 56:16.998
The first time it was shot
in the left leg, right?

56:17.624 --> 56:18.458
Yes.

56:19.417 --> 56:21.711
[JUNG_E breathing raggedly]

56:28.468 --> 56:30.011
Who the hell are you, you son of a--

- [gunshots continue]

56:36.267 --> 56:37.811
[powering down]

56:37.894 --> 56:39.354
Get it back online.

56:44.150 --> 56:45.944
Sir, it's not turning on.

56:47.153 --> 56:47.987
What?

56:48.947 --> 56:50.907
I took over administrative control.

56:51.908 --> 56:52.992
No more for today.

56:58.123 --> 56:59.332

57:00.959 --> 57:02.794
- [intense music playing]

57:02.877 --> 57:04.546
You better turn that thing back on.

57:08.007 --> 57:11.219
- [sternly] We're done.
- [yelling] Do it now, Team Leader Yun!

57:20.728 --> 57:21.729
Director…

57:24.065 --> 57:27.318
The chairman has requested
your presence at HQ.

57:28.820 --> 57:30.238
[exclaims in frustration]

57:33.825 --> 57:35.618
Um, ma'am, are you okay?

57:36.161 --> 57:37.829
The director has completely lost it.

57:37.912 --> 57:39.831
What a lunatic. Crazy.

57:41.166 --> 57:42.292
Everyone can go.

57:43.543 --> 57:45.587
Assemble all the data we collected.

57:46.588 --> 57:48.840
Let's finish up the combat AI project.

57:50.758 --> 57:52.051
As for the data…

57:52.969 --> 57:54.220
send it to me right away.

57:55.054 --> 57:56.723
- [all grunting in assent]
- Of course, ma'am.

57:56.806 --> 57:57.724
All right.

57:57.807 --> 57:58.808
Let's go.

57:59.434 --> 58:00.268

- Hello, ma'am.
- I've copied and exported 22's data.

1:00:12.400 --> 1:00:14.485
Uh, uh… Good!

1:00:14.569 --> 1:00:16.613
[nervous laugh] That's great.

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:19.324
I was just prepping 23,

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:21.618

1:00:22.535 --> 1:00:24.287
Oh, wait. Wait, ma'am!

Oh, please don't, uh, get the wrong idea.

If I could explain,
it would clear things up, I swear.

It's not what it looks like?

Uh, yes. Orders from headquarters.

1:00:57.153 --> 1:00:58.696

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:01.991
It's a product development
for Captain Yun.

1:01:02.075 --> 1:01:04.160
They told me to test it out.
It came from HQ.

1:01:05.161 --> 1:01:06.621
[stuttering] It's true. I promise.

1:01:07.538 --> 1:01:09.207
Product development?

1:01:09.290 --> 1:01:13.211
Yes. Well, she was a war hero.
Sort of an idol.

1:01:13.294 --> 1:01:17.256
And headquarters, um,
they think there's value in exploring

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:19.425
a product with a sexual application.

1:01:19.509 --> 1:01:22.178
That it will make serious money.

1:04:59.395 --> 1:05:00.479
You're injured.

1:05:02.481 --> 1:05:05.192

1:05:22.877 --> 1:05:25.129
The damage from the torture is critical,
