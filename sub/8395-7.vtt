WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.712
SARAH'S A BIG PART OF MY LIFE.

00:02.830 --> 00:05.276
SHE'S GONNA BE A PART OF RUBY'S.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.927
OKAY.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.519
I HATE MOM.
SHE'S THE WORST.

00:08.620 --> 00:11.692
IT'S SO MUCH BETTER HERE
WITH YOU GUYS.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.529
AMBER, IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO THIS.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.143
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

00:15.250 --> 00:17.138
HOW HARD SOMETHING LIKE THIS
IS TO DO BY YOURSELF.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.319
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

00:18.430 --> 00:20.705
I REALLY WANT
TO MAKE A GO OF THIS.

00:20.810 --> 00:22.732
OKAY, WE NEED TO TELL THEM
WE'RE NOT GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

00:22.850 --> 00:26.183
YOU'RE READY TO SAY THAT
TO THEM?

00:38.690 --> 00:41.341
HELLO?

00:41.450 --> 00:43.304
[dog whines]

00:43.420 --> 00:44.512
OH.

00:44.630 --> 00:46.109
HI. YOU'RE OUT OF BED.

00:46.210 --> 00:48.656
THERE'S A SCARY MONSTER
IN MY ROOM.

00:48.770 --> 00:51.625
OH, NO, THAT SOUNDS SO SCARY.

00:51.740 --> 00:52.809
COME HERE.

00:52.910 --> 00:55.219
OH, I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE.

00:55.330 --> 00:57.491
IT'S CURRENTLY 6:00 A.M.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.397
UH, IS IT 6:00?
WOW, IT'S KIND OF EARLY.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.569
MOM ALWAYS GETS OUT OF BED
AT 6:00.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.363
DAD SOMETIMES HITS
SNOOZE FOUR TIMES,

01:04.780 --> 01:06.224
BUT MOM HAS PROBLEMS
WITH THAT, AND SO DO I.

01:06.340 --> 01:08.479
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
THAT'S--6:24--

01:08.580 --> 01:10.195
YOU ARE CURRENTLY
THE ACTING PARENT
BECAUSE MOM AND DAD

01:10.310 --> 01:11.641
ARE SOLICITING
DONATIONS FOR
CHAMBERS ACADEMY

01:11.760 --> 01:13.899
IN SACRAMENTO,
MEANING THAT YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR ME

01:14.000 --> 01:15.786
AND NORA BEING ON THE
ALCATRAZ DOCKS AT 10:00 A.M.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.481
OH, YEAH.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.411
GONNA CONQUER THE OLD FEARS
AND GO TO ALCATRAZ TODAY, HUH?

01:20.520 --> 01:21.487
TOMORROW.IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.

01:21.590 --> 01:23.069
I MEANT TOMORROW.

01:23.180 --> 01:24.909
WE'RE GOING
TO ALCATRAZ TOMORROW.I STILL HAVEN'T
HAD COFFEE, SO--

01:25.010 --> 01:26.170
WE HAVE TICKETS
FOR THE 11:00 FERRY.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.042
- ALL OTHER TIMES ARE SOLD OUT.
- I'M HUNGRY.

01:28.150 --> 01:29.594
- YOU'RE HUNGRY?
- DON'T INTERRUPT ME, NORA.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.769
- OKAY, IT'S--IT'S OKAY.
- IT SHOULD TAKE 26 MINUTES

01:31.880 --> 01:33.871
EXACTLY WITHOUT TRAFFIC,
BUT I ASSUME THERE WILL BE
TRAFFIC,

01:33.990 --> 01:35.116
MEANING THAT YOU
SHOULD PROBABLY

01:35.230 --> 01:36.606
CHECK THE TRAFFIC REPORT
ON THE DAY OF.

01:36.710 --> 01:38.154
ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE'LL
CHECK THE TRAFFIC--

01:38.270 --> 01:39.532
THOUGH I SHOULD
PROBABLY DO THAT,

01:39.650 --> 01:40.912
BECAUSE I DO NOT TRUST
YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITIES.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.237
EVIDENCE--IT IS CURRENTLY 6:03,
AND YOU ARE STILL IN BED.

01:43.340 --> 01:46.719
WELL, I HAVE A
DIFFERENT SYSTEM.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.539
[exhales]

01:50.660 --> 01:54.551
OH, BOY, THIS IS WHAT I
AM TALKING ABOUT.

01:54.660 --> 01:59.450
BEAUTIFUL DAY, OPEN ROAD,
GOT MY GRANDSON HERE--PERFECT.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.187
GO AHEAD--
GET IN THE RIGHT LANE.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.076
GET IN THE RIGHT LANE.
RIGHT LANE, RIGHT LANE--

02:03.190 --> 02:06.489
COME ON.
YEAH, HUH?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.113
DOESN'T SHE HANDLE
LIKE A DREAM?

02:08.230 --> 02:09.800
SHE DEFINITELY DOES.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.195
I WANT YOU TO FEEL
THAT SUSPENSION.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.814
- ISN'T THAT SOMETHING, HUH?
- YEP.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.672
WHERE AM I EXITING?

02:16.790 --> 02:18.303
OKAY, GET IN THE RIGHT LANE.

02:18.410 --> 02:19.809
GET IN THE RIGHT LANE HERE.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.091
[indistinct chatter]

02:22.210 --> 02:24.417
AH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL!

02:26.560 --> 02:28.721
WHERE ARE WE?

02:30.660 --> 02:33.720
WE'RE AT BIG TOP BURGER,
GRANDPA?

02:33.840 --> 02:35.660
INDEED, WE ARE.

02:35.770 --> 02:37.635
WE DROVE TO OAKLAND
TO GO TO BIG TOP BURGER?

02:37.740 --> 02:39.355
YEAH,
I WISH THERE WAS ONE CLOSER,

02:39.460 --> 02:41.633
BUT THESE ARE THE TIMES
WE LIVE IN, GRANDSON.

02:41.740 --> 02:43.321
GRANDPA, I THOUGHT
THAT WE WERE GOING

02:43.430 --> 02:44.909
TO THE DOCTOR OR SOMETHING.

02:45.020 --> 02:46.009
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

02:46.130 --> 02:47.267
BECAUSE YOU
MADE IT SOUND URGENT.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.951
WELL, IT IS URGENT.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.119
YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S GOT ME EATING
NOTHING BUT GRASS AND TWIGS.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.788
YES, BECAUSE YOU JUST
HAD HEART SURGERY.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.232
[scoffs]
PLEASE.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.205
I CAN'T HAVE YOU
EATING THIS STUFF.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.346
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.

02:59.450 --> 03:01.680
WHEN I GAVE YOU THIS CAR,

03:01.800 --> 03:04.416
DID YOU THINK IT CAME
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED?

03:04.520 --> 03:06.488
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE WRONG.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.625
WELL, THIS IS THE ONE TIME,

03:08.740 --> 03:10.594
BUT YOU'RE NOT GETTING
A MILK SHAKE OR ANYTHING.

03:10.700 --> 03:11.735
I'M NOT?

03:11.840 --> 03:12.875
NO.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.016
[laughs]

03:15.120 --> 03:17.156
I'M GLAD THAT'S SO FUNNY,
BUT I'M--

03:17.260 --> 03:20.536
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE MAKING
THE RULES? YOU ARE SO--YOU CAN'T BE EATING THIS STUFF.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.289
YEAH, I JUST
DROVE FOREVER TO GET HERE.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.401
YOU ARE SO ADORABLE
WHEN YOU MAKE THE RULES.

03:23.510 --> 03:24.534
WELCOME TO BIG TOP BURGER.

03:24.650 --> 03:25.366
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND ORDER?

03:25.480 --> 03:27.619
CAN I HELP YOU?

03:27.720 --> 03:29.642
OKAY, YOU KNOW,
IT'S GOT TO STAY IN THE BAG,

03:29.760 --> 03:31.204
THIS CAMERA,
WHEN YOU'RE ON THAT BOAT.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.517
DOESN'T COME OUT OF THE BAG
UNTIL YOU GET TO LAND.

03:33.620 --> 03:34.416
I UNDERSTAND.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.442
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SEE.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.822
IF YOU SEE A MERMAID
POPPING OUT--

03:37.940 --> 03:39.487
MERMAIDS AREN'T REAL.

03:39.590 --> 03:40.966
I DON'T GOT TO REMIND YOU
HOW EXPENSIVE THE LENS IS--

03:41.080 --> 03:42.411
$548.

03:42.530 --> 03:43.906
THAT'S WHY I'M
GIVING IT TO YOU...

03:44.010 --> 03:45.181
- YES.
- 'CAUSE YOU KNOW.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.803
IT'S THE 28-135
P-CLASS ULTRASONIC.

03:46.910 --> 03:48.423
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU--YOU KNOW THE DEAL.

03:48.530 --> 03:49.872
I'M WELL AWARE
OF ITS RARITY

03:49.980 --> 03:51.732
AND ITS COST AND OF
WHAT SALT WATER
COULD DO TO IT.

03:51.850 --> 03:54.501
- SALT WATER IS THE END OF THIS.
- I UNDERSTAND.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.771
AND ALSO, I NEED IT
FOR A SHOOT WEDNESDAY MORNING,

03:56.890 --> 03:58.539
SO YOU GOT TO GIVE IT TO ME
AS SOON AS YOU'RE DONE.

03:58.650 --> 04:00.094
ALL RIGHT?

04:00.200 --> 04:01.474
I'M NOT CONFIDENT
IN MY ABILITY TO DO THAT.

04:01.580 --> 04:02.717
WHY NOT?

04:02.820 --> 04:04.447
MY CARETAKER MAY NOT HAVE
THE PROPER TRANSPORTATION.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.233
- WHO'S YOUR CARETAKER?
- AMBER.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.035
[door opens]
WELL, SHE CAN--

04:08.140 --> 04:09.368
- WELL, I'M GONNA COME BY.- I HATE MY SCHOOL. I WANT TO
TRANSFER.

04:09.490 --> 04:10.309
- HELLO, RU BY.

04:10.420 --> 04:11.626
WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:11.730 --> 04:13.038
YOU HAVE TO PUT ME
IN A DIFFERENT SCHOOL,

04:13.140 --> 04:14.619
ANYWHERE BUT ROOSEVELT.
OKAY?

04:14.730 --> 04:16.174
CHAMBERS ACADEMY
CURRENTLY HAS OPENINGS,

04:16.290 --> 04:18.076
BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHALLENGE
THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU

04:18.180 --> 04:21.115
TO SUCCEED IN A TRADITIONAL
CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.733
DO YOU HAVE SUCH A CHALLENGE?

04:22.840 --> 04:23.772
- ALL RIGHT, MAX, HERE.
- NO.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.108
- TAKE IT. GO.
- THANK YOU FOR THE LOAN, HANK.

04:25.230 --> 04:26.538
- LET ME TALK TO RUBY.
- GOOD-BYE.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.220
- ALL RIGHT, BE CAREFUL.
- GOOD-BYE, AUNT SARAH.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.536
BYE, MAX.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.949
WHAT HAPPENED? COME ON.
[sighs]

04:31.060 --> 04:33.199
- WHAT'S GOINCIIJBN? TEACHERS?

04:33.300 --> 04:35.165
WELL, WHAT?
WHY DO YOU--YOU NEED--

04:35.270 --> 04:36.714
YOU'RE NOT BEING CHALLENGED
OVER THERE?

04:36.820 --> 04:38.230
IT'S NOT--

04:38.340 --> 04:41.582
- HEY, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
- WHOSE NAME?

04:41.690 --> 04:42.850
JAKE.
HIS NAME IS JAKE.

04:42.970 --> 04:44.585
UGH, WHY ARE THEY
ALWAYS NAMED JAKE?

04:44.690 --> 04:46.271
- WHO'S JAKE?
- OR NICK?

04:46.380 --> 04:48.621
I CAN'T SEE HIM AGAIN.
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW--

04:48.730 --> 04:50.595
WELL, SHE SHOULD PROBABLY
GO TO A DIFFERENT SCHOOL.
YOU KNOW--

04:50.700 --> 04:52.930
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:53.050 --> 04:54.119
WHAT'S GOING ON?- SHE HAS A THING WITH JAKE.

04:54.220 --> 04:56.211
SHE CAN NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.
ON THE OTHER HAND, HERE--

04:56.330 --> 04:57.354
I WANT TO KNOW WHO JAKE IS.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.529
TAKE A WALK WITH ME
FOR A SECOND.

04:58.640 --> 04:59.459
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
AM I GOING WITH YOU?

04:59.570 --> 05:01.367
IF YOU LEAVE SCHOOL,

05:01.470 --> 05:02.289
JAKE WILL KNOW
IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.844
WHO'S JAKE?

05:03.950 --> 05:05.394
AND THINK OF WHAT THAT'LL DO
TO HIS EGO, HIS--

05:05.510 --> 05:06.579
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.
I'M STAYING HERE.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.090
[Ruby]
I KNOW,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA SEE HIM AGAIN.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.407
YOU DON'T WANT
TO SEE HIM AGAIN NOW,

05:10.510 --> 05:12.922
BUT, I MEAN,
TOMORROW YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY...

05:13.030 --> 05:14.895
[door closes]

05:18.450 --> 05:20.418
THIS BRINGS US TO THE HOUSE.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.272
YOU'VE BOTH BEEN
INCREDIBLY AMICABLE SO FAR,

05:22.390 --> 05:24.346
BUT THIS IS USUALLY
THE TOUGH ONE.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.109
AT OUR LAST SESSION,
I ASKED YOU TO THINK

05:26.220 --> 05:28.529
ABOUT HOW YOU'D LIKE
TO HANDLE IT.

05:32.190 --> 05:34.499
WELL,

05:34.610 --> 05:37.909
I THINK THAT THE FAIREST THING
TO DO IS TO SELL THE HOUSE.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.294
IT'S A GOOD MARKET.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.608
WE'LL MAKE A PROFIT.
WE CAN SPLIT IT, 50/50.

05:42.720 --> 05:44.676
JOEL?

05:50.280 --> 05:52.748
JOEL?

05:54.450 --> 05:56.623
SHE CAN HAVE IT.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.519
IT'S OUR KIDS' HOME.
IT'S YOUR HOME.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.736
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.593
JULIA, ASSUMING
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT--

06:12.750 --> 06:13.819
YEAH.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.467
OKAY.

06:15.580 --> 06:16.740
THAT'S EVERYTHING, THEN.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.169
I CAN GET ALL THIS
TO YOUR ATTORNEY.

06:18.270 --> 06:19.669
SHE'LL DRAW UP
THE DIVORCE PAPERS.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.405
YOU TWO HAVE BEEN GREAT.

06:21.510 --> 06:23.023
AND THE HARD PART IS OVER.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.404
SORROW AND SHAME

06:25.520 --> 06:30.822
LIKE I'VE NEVER KNOWN

06:30.940 --> 06:33.170
[elevator dings]
I'LL TAKE THE NEXT ONE.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.794
NO, IT'S OKAY.

06:35.910 --> 06:38.526
GET IT RIGHT

06:38.630 --> 06:42.908
ON THE FIRST
OR THE SECOND TIME

06:43.020 --> 06:48.913
WILL THE THIRD BE
A WASTED LIFE?

06:49.020 --> 06:53.161
THIS IS FOR LOVE

06:53.270 --> 06:56.546
THIS IS
FOR LOVE

06:56.650 --> 07:00.928
THAT WE TRY

07:01.040 --> 07:04.441
AND THAT WE PRAY

07:04.560 --> 07:09.384
OH, THIS IS FOR LOVE

07:09.490 --> 07:13.278
THIS IS FOR LOVE

07:13.390 --> 07:17.463
THAT WE TRY

07:17.570 --> 07:21.939
AND THAT WE PRAY

07:27.410 --> 07:30.095
WHEN WE WERE YOUNG
WE WERE SMALL

07:30.200 --> 07:33.328
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW IT

07:33.450 --> 07:37.341
AH-AH-AH

07:37.450 --> 07:40.101
WHEN YOU WERE HURT
YOU WOULD SMILE

07:40.210 --> 07:43.520
SO YOU DIDN'T SHOW IT

07:43.630 --> 07:47.214
AH-AH-AH

07:47.320 --> 07:51.188
AND I

07:51.290 --> 07:54.157
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:58.780 --> 08:01.783
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

08:03.790 --> 08:07.237
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

08:07.340 --> 08:09.092
OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.

08:09.210 --> 08:12.338
IF X IS THE MEAN
OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF SIZE N

08:12.450 --> 08:16.170
WHERE N EQUALS--

08:16.280 --> 08:18.999
IT'S LIKE A--A SQUIGGLY LINE
IN FRONT OF THE Y,

08:19.110 --> 08:22.352
AND IT'S, LIKE,
WEARING A TOP HAT?

08:22.460 --> 08:24.974
- I HAVE NO CLUE.
- I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

08:25.090 --> 08:27.081
YEAH.

08:27.190 --> 08:30.432
[laughs]
- YOU'RE GONNA ACE THIS.
- I HAVE TO TAKE THIS TEST
IN THREE DAYS.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.644
IT'S NOT FUNNY. I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO READ THE QUESTIONS.

08:32.750 --> 08:34.502
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
AN ART HISTORY MAJOR

08:34.610 --> 08:35.713
HELPING YOU STUDY.

08:35.820 --> 08:36.889
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HELP YOU AT ALL.

08:36.990 --> 08:38.617
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW TO READ THE QUESTIONS.

08:38.720 --> 08:39.709
YOU CAN'T CLOSE THE BOOK.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.447
COME ON,
LET'S JUST SWITCH GEARS.

08:41.550 --> 08:42.926
YOU HAVE TO LET YOUR BRAIN REST.

08:43.030 --> 08:44.611
- HAVEN'T YONC'J'EARD THIS?

08:44.730 --> 08:47.893
- MM-HMM.
- I HAVE 72 HOURS TO BE SO SMART

08:48.010 --> 08:49.762
- AND TAKE THIS TEST.
- MM, YOU HAVE 68 HOURS.

08:49.870 --> 08:51.417
- YOU REALLY ARE BAD AT MATH.

THIS IS GONNA BE AN ADVENTURE

09:25.660 --> 09:27.173
IS IT GONNA TAKE VERY LONG?

09:27.290 --> 09:30.418

10:42.840 --> 10:45.707
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE

10:45.810 --> 10:47.186
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS

10:47.300 --> 10:48.255
OH, GOD.

10:48.370 --> 10:50.429
WHERE ARE THE KEYS?

10:50.540 --> 10:51.359

11:03.930 --> 11:05.306
WE'RE GONNA TAKE MY CAR.
CAN'T FIND THE KEYS.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.694
GO SHUT THAT DOOR. OKAY.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.869
- THIS IS RIIIIIJICULOUS.

11:07.970 --> 11:09.039
THE TRAFFIC APP UPDATED.

11:09.150 --> 11:10.139
WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A DIFFERENT CAR.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.354
THERE IS INCREASED TRAFFIC
ON THE 580,

11:12.460 --> 11:16.567
MEANING THAT WE HAVE TWO
MINUTES TO BE ON THE ROAD IF
WE WANT TO BE THERE ON TIME.

11:16.670 --> 11:17.489
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.703
WHAT DO YOU PLAN
TO DO ABOUT THAT?

11:18.810 --> 11:19.879
MAX, WE'RE GONNA FIX IT.

11:19.980 --> 11:20.981
NORA'S HEADING
INTO THE STREET.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.296
NORA, NORA, NORA!
STAY, STAY, STAY--WHOO.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.436
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:24.540 --> 11:27.054
COME HERE.
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.549
MAX--MAX, GET TH E--GET THE
CAR SEAT OUT OF THERE FOR ME.

11:29.650 --> 11:30.924
THAT'S NOT MY JOB.

11:31.030 --> 11:31.883
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THE FERRY,
YOU'LL HELP ME.

11:32.000 --> 11:32.921
COME ON.
GET IT OUT, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.

11:33.030 --> 11:35.783
COME ON.

11:35.900 --> 11:38.539
THIS IS NOT ON MY LIST
OF RESPONSIBILITIES.

11:38.660 --> 11:40.275
JAM IT IN THERE.
LET'S JUST TRY...

11:40.380 --> 11:42.519
- BARELY EVEN...
- TO KEEP IT TOGETHER, OKAY?

11:42.630 --> 11:43.722

- FITS.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.239
COME HERE, BABY GIRL.
HEY. MAX...

11:45.350 --> 11:46.624
LET ME GO. LET ME DOWN.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.627
THERE'S NO CAR--
THERE'S NO HOOKS.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.901
IT IS NOW
PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

11:50.010 --> 11:51.637
FOR US TO BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT TO THE FERRY IN TIME.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.082
I CAN'T TAKE THE BABY IN THERE
BECAUSE THERE'S NO HOOKS.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.919
- I DON'T KNOW.
- HOW CAN YOU HAVE A CAR

11:55.020 --> 11:56.908
THAT IS--THAT IS INCAPABLE
OF TRANSPORTING CHILDREN

11:57.020 --> 11:58.248
IF YOU ARE
ABOUT TO HAVE A CHILD?

11:58.370 --> 12:01.954
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
THE WORST MOTHER IN HISTORY!

12:02.060 --> 12:03.743
LET ME DOWN.
LET ME GO. LET ME DOWN.

12:03.860 --> 12:06.715
DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE ME

12:06.820 --> 12:07.752
IT'S OKAY.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.589
[door opens]

12:09.690 --> 12:11.032
[door slams]

12:12.140 --> 12:15.029
[rock music]

12:16.700 --> 12:18.099
[Ruby]
WHY DON'T THE COOL GUYS
LIKE ME?

12:18.220 --> 12:20.620
WHAT? THEY'RE NOT EVEN
COOL. THAT'S WHY.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.628
- BUT THEY ARE.
- NO. IT'LL CHANGE.

12:22.740 --> 12:23.900
WAIT TILL YOUR 20TH HIGH
SCHOOL REUNION.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.898
BUT HE GETS PHOEBE CATES.

12:26.020 --> 12:27.738
NO, HE DOESN--
THIS IS A FANTASY.

12:27.850 --> 12:29.772
BUT IF I WAS AS HOT
AS PHOEBE CATES,

12:29.880 --> 12:31.051
HE WOULD TOTALLY LIKE ME.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.539
[laughs]
FIRST OF ALL, NO ONE'S
AS HOT AS PHOEBE CATES.

12:34.650 --> 12:35.639
SHE WAS, LIKE,
A FREAK OF NATURE.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.809
ANYWAY, THIS IS GONNA
BE EDITED FOR TV.

12:39.650 --> 12:42.619
BUT, AGAIN,
THIS IS HIS FANTASY.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.961
- YEAH, YEAH. HEY.
- HEY, HI.

12:45.070 --> 12:46.378
RUBY,
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME HONKING?

12:46.480 --> 12:48.243
- I'M DOUBLE-PARKED.
- OH.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.749
NO, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE UNTIL, LIKE,

12:49.870 --> 12:50.825
3:00, RIGHT, THOUGH?

12:50.940 --> 12:52.692
YOU DIDN'T GET MY TEXT?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.041
I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE.
I'M SORRY.

12:55.150 --> 12:56.424
WELL, THAT'S A FIRST.
COME ON, SWEETIE. LET'S GO.

12:56.530 --> 12:57.451
- GET YOUR STUFF.
- ALL RIGHT.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.004
I CAN'T GO NOW, THOUGH.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.280
THE MOVIE'S--THE MOVIE'S NOT
EVEN OVER THOUGH.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.469
WE'LL WATCH IT LATER.
WE'LL FINISH IT LATER.

13:01.570 --> 13:02.969
FINE.

13:03.090 --> 13:06.639
SORRY, SHE'S IN A MOOD
BECAUSE OF JAKE.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.570
WHO'S JAKE?

13:08.680 --> 13:11.126
YEAH, WHO'S JAKE?
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

13:11.230 --> 13:12.982
OH, I'M SURE
SHE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT HIM.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.125
HE'S A BOY SHE LIKES
AT SCHOOL.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.855
- HE'S A COOL GUY.
- I GET IT.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.336
I GET THE GIST OF IT.
RUBY, COME ON, SWEETIE.

13:18.450 --> 13:19.678
LET'S GO.

13:19.790 --> 13:20.825
- WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE, RIGHT?
- OKAY.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.376
- YEAH, YEAH.
_ 50--

13:23.490 --> 13:27.381
ARE YOU--ARE YOU WATCHING
FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH?

13:27.490 --> 13:29.867
YES. IT'S THE TV VERSION,
SO MOST OF IT'S CUT OUT.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.117
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT, HANK,

13:31.220 --> 13:32.733
WITH OUR 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

13:32.840 --> 13:34.068
- WATCHING A FILM...
- OH, HE WAS--

13:34.190 --> 13:36.010
THAT GLORIFIES
SEXUAL PROMISCUITY?

13:36.120 --> 13:38.566
AH, THAT DOESN'T--
WELL, SARAH WAS WATCHING IT,

13:38.670 --> 13:39.739
- SO--WITH HER--
- OH, MY--

13:39.850 --> 13:41.397
AMBER SAW IT
WHEN SHE WAS HER AGE.

13:41.510 --> 13:44.081
IT'S ACTUALLY GOT A LOT OF
GOOD HIGH SCHOOL DYNAMICS AND--

13:44.200 --> 13:46.782
I THINK THAT WE HAVE
DIFFERENT PARENTING STYLES.

13:46.890 --> 13:49.711
HMM, WOW.
UM...

13:49.820 --> 13:51.640
I JUST THINK
MAYBE NEXT TIME,

13:51.760 --> 13:53.716
WHEN YOU WATCH A MOVIE
WITH MY DAUGHTER,

13:53.830 --> 13:55.479
- IT'S NOT A FILM...
- LISTEN, LISTEN.

13:55.590 --> 13:57.137
WHERE A GIRL SHOWS HER BREASTS
TO GET ATTENTION.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.342
- HEY, HEY.
- I APOLOGIZE.

13:58.450 --> 14:01.658
I DIDN'T VIEW IT THAT WAY
AT ALL. I--

14:01.770 --> 14:02.930
IT'S OKAY.
LISTEN, I GOT TO GO.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.928
I GOT TO GET THAT CAMERA
FROM MAX, REMEMBER,

14:05.050 --> 14:07.280
FOR THAT JOB TOMORROW.

14:09.530 --> 14:11.589
WOW, REALLY?

14:11.710 --> 14:14.292
OH, YEAH.
GET USED TO THAT.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.539
- RUBY, I'LL BE IN THE CAR.
- OKAY.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.359
LET'S GO.

14:19.470 --> 14:22.291
[door opens]

14:22.410 --> 14:23.684
[door closes]

14:23.790 --> 14:26.850
[knocking on door]

14:26.960 --> 14:28.996
- HEY.
- HI. UM...

14:29.100 --> 14:30.271
- YOU HAVE A SECOND?
- YEAH, COME ON IN.

14:30.380 --> 14:31.199
OKAY.

14:31.310 --> 14:32.754
[siren wails in the distance]

14:32.870 --> 14:35.486
[dog barks]

14:35.590 --> 14:36.966
PRETTY NICE, HUH?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.628
I WAS--I WAS WAITING,
YOU KNOW,

14:39.740 --> 14:42.117
TO FIGURE OUT, YOU KNOW,

14:42.220 --> 14:44.188
WHAT WE WERE GONNA DO,

14:44.290 --> 14:48.363
SO I COULD PROBABLY
DO SOME FURNITURE SHOPPING.

14:48.470 --> 14:52.645
- UM, JOEL, THE HOUSE--
- YES.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.674
YESTERDAY WAS EMOTIONAL,

14:55.790 --> 14:58.372
SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO CHANGE YOUR MIND.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.371
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.040
JOEL, WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE
TOGETHER.

15:05.140 --> 15:06.448
- YEAH--
- THE SMART THING TO DO

15:06.560 --> 15:10.109
IS JUST TAKE THE EMOTION
OUT OF IT AND SPLIT THE ASSET.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.689
IT'S NOT AN ASSET,
THOUGH, JULIA.

15:11.800 --> 15:12.869
- IT'S AN ASSET.
- IT'S A HOME.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.174
IN A DIVORCE,
EVERYTHING'S AN ASSET.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.188
I REFUSE TO TALK ABOUT
IT LIKE THAT.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.564
WE SHOULD JUST BE REASONABLE.

15:16.670 --> 15:20.595
WE BROUGHT OUR BABY GIRL HOME
TO THAT HOUSE, JULIA.

15:20.710 --> 15:24.464
IT'S THE FIRST SAFE PLACE
OUR SON EVER SPENT THE NIGHT.

15:24.570 --> 15:27.152
I MEAN, HECK--THE FIRST NIGHT
WE OWNED IT, YOU KNOW,

15:27.270 --> 15:30.194
WE DIDN'T HAVE FURNITURE,
EVEN ELECTRICITY.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.540
BUT WE JUST LAID ON THAT FLOOR,

15:31.650 --> 15:33.094
AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE

15:33.200 --> 15:35.953
AND ARGUED ABOUT WHAT COLOR
WE WERE GONNA PAINT THE WALLS.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.992
IT'S NOT AN ASSET.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.240
IT'S A HOME.

15:41.350 --> 15:45.798
AND IT KILLS ME TO WALK AWAY
FROM IT, BUT...

15:45.910 --> 15:47.309
I HURT YOU.

15:50.190 --> 15:52.385
I HURT YOU,
AND I OWN THAT.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.539
I GET THAT.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.053
SO I DON'T WANT THE HOUSE.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.640
IF I CAN'T HAVE YOU IN IT,
I DON'T WANT IT.

16:12.830 --> 16:13.797
I'M SORRY.
I'M--

16:13.900 --> 16:16.368
I SHOULDN'T HAVE--

16:30.050 --> 16:32.325
[exhales]

16:43.960 --> 16:45.166
- HEY.
- HEY, HI.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.168
- HI.
- MAX HERE?

16:47.280 --> 16:48.508
YEAH, HE'S IN THE KITCHEN.

16:48.620 --> 16:49.757
HE'S KIND OF FREAKING OUT
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH.

16:49.870 --> 16:50.894
WHAT'S HE DOING?

16:51.010 --> 16:51.863
HE'S JUST FREAKING OUT.

16:51.970 --> 16:52.937
WE HAD, LIKE,

16:53.040 --> 16:54.723
A SCHEDULING ISSUE, AND HE'S--

16:54.840 --> 16:57.001
YOU KNOW, HE'S DOING THAT THING
WHERE HE'S PANICKING, AND I'M--

16:57.110 --> 16:58.316
I'M REALLY STRESSED BECAUSE I--

16:58.430 --> 17:00.148
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T KNOW--

17:00.260 --> 17:02.899
MAX.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.079
[sighs]
I'LL BE UPSTAIRS.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.227
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAX?
- THE FERRY LEFT AT 11:00.

17:08.330 --> 17:09.638
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
ON THE FERRY,

17:09.750 --> 17:10.842
BUT I WAS NOT ON THE FERRY,

17:10.960 --> 17:12.222
AND I DIDN'T GET
TO TAKE ANY PICTURES.

17:12.340 --> 17:13.989
- IT SUCKS. YEAH, IT SUCKS.
- YES, IT DOES.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.716
BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET ALL
WORKED UP JUST FOR THAT?

17:16.820 --> 17:19.266
I CANNOT HELP BEING WORKED UP,
BECAUSE I AM UPSET.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.757
- I AM VERY, VERY UPSET...
- I SEE THAT.

17:21.860 --> 17:22.849
WHICH IS
WHY I'M DOING MY BREATHING

17:22.970 --> 17:24.858
AND RELAXATION EXERCISES.

17:24.970 --> 17:25.959
WELL, IT AIN'T WORKING,
OBVIOUSLY.

17:26.070 --> 17:28.277
- I JUST STARTED THEM.
- WELL--

17:28.390 --> 17:29.834
YOUR CAMERA IS THERE
IN THE KITCHEN.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.146
YOU CAN GET IT,
AND THEN YOU CAN GO.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.046
I SEE MY CAMERA.
I KNOW.

17:32.150 --> 17:33.048
I'M GONNA TAKE IT.
I'M GONNA GO.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.356
NOT RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

17:34.460 --> 17:35.939
I'M A LITTLE WORKED UP TOO,
YOU KNOW.

17:36.050 --> 17:37.529
DID SOMEONE PROMISE
TO TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE

17:37.640 --> 17:40.017
AND THEN HAVE INSUFFICIENT
TRANSPORTATION TO BE ABLE

17:40.120 --> 17:41.394
- TO FULFILL THAT PROMISE?
- NO, NO, NO.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.572
NOTHING LIKE THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:44.680 --> 17:47.649
- I'M JUST GONNA WALK WITH YOU.
- OKAY.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.365
SARAH AND SANDY WERE FIGHTING.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.880
THEY'RE FIGHTING, AND I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THEM, AND--

17:52.000 --> 17:52.887
AND I PANICKED.

17:53.000 --> 17:53.921
OKAY, I PANICKED.

17:54.030 --> 17:56.476
I WALKED OUT.

17:56.590 --> 18:00.515
I DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN I CAN'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE.

18:00.630 --> 18:03.007
DR. PELIKAN SAYS IT'S BECAUSE
IT MAKES ME FEEL ISOLATED.

18:03.110 --> 18:04.247
THAT'S A GOOD WORD FOR IT--
ISOLATED.

18:04.350 --> 18:07.979
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.524
BUT I LIKE BEING BY MYSELF

18:09.640 --> 18:13.189
MORE THAN I LIKE
BEING WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

18:13.290 --> 18:16.009
WHY IS ISOLATED BAD?

18:16.120 --> 18:17.087
I LIKE BEING ALONE TOO.

18:17.190 --> 18:18.703
TRUST ME.

18:18.820 --> 18:20.640
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE I LIKE.
I MEAN, THERE'S A FEW.

18:20.750 --> 18:24.129
THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE
THAT I LIKE BEING AROUND.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.572
I LIKE OTIS,

18:26.690 --> 18:29.545
MY PARENTS SOMETIMES,

18:29.660 --> 18:32.299
AND YOU.

18:32.420 --> 18:35.514
OH, GOD, WHY DID I WALK OUT?

18:35.630 --> 18:39.339
I PANICKED,
AND I WALKED OUT.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.735
DAMN IT.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.354
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
TELL ME WHERE WE'RE
GOING?

18:44.460 --> 18:47.213
IT'S ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS,
GRANDSON.

18:47.330 --> 18:48.729
COME ON.
YOU DON'T NEED
TO KNOW ANYTHING.

18:48.850 --> 18:50.329
- YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.
- JUST KEEP DRIVING.

18:50.430 --> 18:53.081
YEAH, I HAVE THIS ECON TEST
THAT I'M STUDYING FOR,

18:53.200 --> 18:55.020
SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW LONG I CAN STAY HERE

18:55.130 --> 18:56.028
IF IT'S THAT MUCH FURTHER.

18:56.130 --> 18:57.358
- ECONOMICS?
- YEAH.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.232
OH, HECK, WELL,
THEN YOU NEED A BREAK, HUH?

18:59.340 --> 19:01.649
JUST ENJOY YOURSELF.
COME ON, JUST KEEP DRIVING.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.785
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN WE GET THERE.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.892
THE ONLY ONE TO ASK
IS ME

19:10.660 --> 19:12.582
GOSH.

19:16.810 --> 19:19.187
JIMINY CHRISTMAS.

19:19.290 --> 19:22.179
THIS DIDN'T USED TO BE HERE.

19:22.290 --> 19:24.531
THIS WAS WIDE OPEN SPACES.

19:24.640 --> 19:28.292
SEE FOREVER--I MEAN,
THIS WHOLE THING WAS A FIELD

19:28.400 --> 19:32.268
AND HAD BEAUTIFUL TREES
IN IT.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.372
WASN'T NONE OF THIS.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.027
WHY DID WE COME HERE?
I DON'T--

19:36.140 --> 19:39.132
WELL, MY DAD--
HE USED TO TAKE ME OVER HERE,

19:39.240 --> 19:41.481
AND WE'D GO--
WE'D GO SHOOTING, YOU KNOW?

19:41.590 --> 19:44.627
SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GREAT
IDEA TO COME OUT HERE WITH YOU.

19:44.730 --> 19:46.106
THA'E'S ALL.

19:46.210 --> 19:48.075
WE USED TO SHOOT
CANS OF CREAMED CORN

19:48.180 --> 19:49.033
AND HAVE ALL KINDS OF FUN.

19:49.150 --> 19:50.242
IT WAS GREAT.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.874
I LEARNED
HOW TO SHOOT HERE WITH HIM.

19:52.980 --> 19:56.279
WE CAME HERE TO SHOOT CANS?
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.254
YEAH, HERE.
HERE, OPEN THE TRUNK.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.362
LET ME SHOW YOU.

20:05.060 --> 20:06.368
YEAH, SEE, I MEAN,

20:06.480 --> 20:08.994
I BROUGHT THE CREAMED CORN
ALL IN THERE.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.067
I DON'T KNOW,
THERE'S NOT...

20:10.170 --> 20:11.262
AND THEN I GOT
THIS 1911...

20:11.380 --> 20:12.472
REALLY MUCH OF ANYTHING
OUT HERE.

20:12.590 --> 20:14.967
9-MILLIMETER COLT.
LOOK AT THAT.

20:15.070 --> 20:16.549
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, GRANDPA--
- ISN'T THAT PRETTY?

20:16.660 --> 20:18.446
PUT IT AWAY.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

20:18.560 --> 20:19.549
I'M JUST SHOWING YOU THE GUN.
THAT'S ALL.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.343
YOU CAN'T PULL OUT A GUN
IN PUBLIC.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.178
- OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE.
- WE'RE ON THE STREET.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.791
WE'RE AT A LIQUOR STORE.

20:24.910 --> 20:25.979
YEAH?

20:26.080 --> 20:28.048
YOU CAN'T HAVE A GUN OUT.

20:28.150 --> 20:29.777
GOD, I TOLD YOU
THAT I WAS BUSY

20:29.880 --> 20:32.110
AND THAT I HAD TO STUDY
AND I HAVE ALL THIS STUFF TO DO,

20:32.230 --> 20:34.494
AND YOU BRING ME OUT HERE
TO SHOOT A GUN.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.579
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW I FEEL ABOUT GUNS.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.296
IT'S CRAZY.

20:40.410 --> 20:42.958
JUST GET IN THE CAR.
LET'S GO.

20:43.060 --> 20:44.948
[car door closes]

20:45.070 --> 20:46.924
[engine starts]

20:52.420 --> 20:53.899
- HI.
- HEY.

20:54.010 --> 20:55.238
DID YOU GET YOUR CAMERA?

20:55.350 --> 20:57.386
YEAH, I DID.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.596
SORRY, I MEAN, I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

21:00.700 --> 21:04.045
I PANICKED AND--
YOU KNOW, HOW--

21:04.150 --> 21:05.151
WHAT HAPPENED?
HOW BAD WAS IT?

21:05.260 --> 21:07.148
WE HAD A TENSE CONVERSATION,

21:07.260 --> 21:08.488
AND THEN--AND THEN SHE LEFT.

21:08.610 --> 21:09.918
WELL, THAT'S GOOD
THAT SHE LEFT, RIGHT?

21:10.020 --> 21:11.226
NO, IT'S NOT GOOD, HANK.

21:11.330 --> 21:12.649
- NOTHING GOT SOLVED.
- WELL, SHE'S TENSE.

21:12.750 --> 21:13.671
- IT WAS VERY TENSE.
- THAT'S HOW SHE IS.

21:13.780 --> 21:15.407
THEN YOU LEFT
AND MADE IT MORE TENSE.

21:15.510 --> 21:16.818
SHE'S TENSE ALL THE TIME.
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.022
- BUT THAT'S NOT OKAY.
- SHE'S IRRATIONAL, THOUGH.

21:18.130 --> 21:19.472
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

21:19.580 --> 21:22.140
SHE'S, YOU KNOW,
YELLING ABOUT A STUPID MOVIE.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.548
HANK, IT'S NOT
ABOUT THE MOVIE.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.036
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT?

21:25.140 --> 21:26.243
I DON'T.

21:26.350 --> 21:28.796
I--NO, WHAT--WHAT?

21:28.900 --> 21:30.902
LOOK, SHE SEES ME
BONDING WITH RUBY.

21:31.010 --> 21:33.069
SHE DOESN'T LIKE THAT.
THAT'S THREATENING TO HER.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.863
SHE THINKS
I'M TAKING HER PLACE.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.902
IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE.

21:37.010 --> 21:38.773
WELL, THEN WHY'S SHE YELLING
ABOUT A MOVIE, THEN?

21:38.880 --> 21:40.359
[sighs]

21:40.470 --> 21:41.869
I SHOULD'VE GOT IT.
I DIDN'T GET IT.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.389
- OKAY, I WENT--I DIDN'T KNOW.
- IT'S OKAY.

21:45.330 --> 21:46.433
AND I HAD TO GET OUT.
I HAD TO GO.

21:46.540 --> 21:49.259
SO I WENT--I WENT TO GET
THE CAMERA, AND THEN--

21:49.370 --> 21:50.678
THEN IT'S AMBER'S CRYING
AND MAX IS PACING...

21:50.790 --> 21:53.509
- WAIT, WHAT?
- SO I HELPED THEM OUT.

21:53.620 --> 21:54.928
- YEAH.
- AMBER'S CRYING?

21:55.030 --> 21:57.021
- YEAH, YEAH.
- ABOUT WHAT?

21:57.140 --> 21:58.994
I-I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S CRYING.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.759
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'T KNOW?

22:00.870 --> 22:03.452
DIDN'T YOU ASK HER?

22:03.560 --> 22:04.891
NO.

22:05.010 --> 22:07.865
[sighs]

22:07.980 --> 22:08.935
THAT'S NOT NORMAL, RIGHT?

22:09.050 --> 22:11.803
I SHOULD'VE ASKED HER.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.320
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

22:13.430 --> 22:15.910
I'M GONNA GO FIND OUT
WHY MY DAUGHTER'S CRYING.

22:16.020 --> 22:17.009
[sighs]

22:17.120 --> 22:18.257
SORRY.
I DIDN'T--

22:18.370 --> 22:20.918
[door opens]

22:21.020 --> 22:22.954
[door closes]

22:27.440 --> 22:30.068
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S ALWAYS OLIVE GARDEN.

22:30.170 --> 22:31.273
- WE CAN ALWAYS JUST RETURN--
- NO, I DON'T HAVE MY BIG PURSE.

22:31.380 --> 22:32.586
IT'S NOT WORTH IT
UNLESS YOU CAN MAKE OUT

22:32.690 --> 22:34.066
WITH 10 POUNDS
OF BREADSTICKS FOR THE ROAD.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.966
THAT'S TRUE.

22:36.070 --> 22:39.198
OR WE COULD JUST GO
AT THE TEN CANS OF CREAMED CORN

22:39.320 --> 22:40.764
IN THE BACKSEAT.

22:40.870 --> 22:42.246
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S--
- WHAT THE HELL IS ALL OF THIS?

22:42.360 --> 22:43.861
MY BIG TRIP WITH GRANDPA--

22:43.980 --> 22:45.379
IT WAS TO SHOOT.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.185
SHOOT GUNS?
[laughs]

22:48.290 --> 22:50.565
WHAT?

22:50.670 --> 22:53.844
WOW, THANK YOU FOR LAUGHING
SO HARD AT ME SHOOTING A GUN.

22:53.950 --> 22:55.292
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST--

22:55.400 --> 22:57.539
I'M, LIKE, TRYING
TO PICTURE YOU WITH A FIREARM.

22:57.650 --> 22:59.641
IT'S NOT REALLY CLICKING.

22:59.750 --> 23:00.887
WELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SEE.
I DIDN'T EVEN--

23:01.000 --> 23:02.809
- DO YOU HAVE A PICTURE?
- NO, I DIDN'T SHOOT THE GUN.

23:02.930 --> 23:04.067
- NOT ONCE?
- NO.

23:04.170 --> 23:05.922
[sighs]

23:06.030 --> 23:07.588
COME ON. YOU COULD HAVE
HUMORED HIM AT LEAST.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.305
I KNOW,
BUT I WAS JUST ANNOYED.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.729
I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD TO STUDY,
AND THEN HE TOOK ME OUT

23:11.830 --> 23:13.343
FOR, LIKE, FIVE HOURS ON A S--

23:13.460 --> 23:15.416
YOU'RE BEING REALLY SELFISH
ABOUT THIS.

23:15.530 --> 23:17.350
HOW AM I BEING SELFISH?

23:17.460 --> 23:19.280
THAT'S SELFISH OF HIM.

23:19.390 --> 23:20.903
I TOLD HIM
THAT I HAD SOMETHING TO DO

23:21.020 --> 23:23.113
AND THAT I WAS SUPER BUSY
AND STRESSED.

23:23.220 --> 23:24.357
YOU REMEMBER, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO READ THE QUESTIONS.

23:24.470 --> 23:25.869
WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T
ABOUT YOU.

23:25.990 --> 23:28.254
HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF THAT?I KNOW IT WASN'T ABOUT ME.

23:28.370 --> 23:30.679
EXACTLY.
IT WAS ABOUT HIM.

23:30.780 --> 23:31.917
- YES, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
- HE CLEARLY HAS SOME,

23:32.030 --> 23:34.191
LIKE, FOND MEMORIES OF SHOOTING
WHEN HE WAS YOUR AGE.

23:34.300 --> 23:37.235
I KNOW, BUT HE COULD'VE GONE
SHOOTING WITH ANY ONE OF US.

23:37.340 --> 23:39.479
WELL, HE DIDN'T WANT
TO GO WITH ANYBODY.
HE WANTED TO GO WITH YOU,

23:39.590 --> 23:42.309
AND HE WANTED YOU TO LOVE IT,

23:42.420 --> 23:43.580
BECAUSE YOUR GRANDFATHER,

23:43.690 --> 23:46.762
WHO, YOU KNOW, FYI,
JUST HAD OPEN-HEART SURGERY--

23:46.870 --> 23:50.033
MAYBE HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
WITH YOU SO THAT IN 50 YEARS,

23:50.150 --> 23:52.698
YOU CAN LOOK BACK AND HAVE
ALL THESE SAME FOND MEMORIES

23:52.810 --> 23:56.359
THAT HE HAD SHOOTING WITH
HIS DAD WHEN HE WAS YOUR AGE.

23:56.460 --> 24:00.908
BUT YEAH,
WOW, WHAT A SELFISH JERK.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.401
[on TV]
PROBLEM WITH KILLING.

24:08.510 --> 24:10.546
OTIS.
[knocking on door]

24:10.650 --> 24:11.548
I LIKE A LITTLE KILLING
NOW AND THEN.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.299
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

24:13.410 --> 24:17.585
HELLO? HI.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.579
WE'RE PARENTS NOW.
WE HAVE TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE.

24:20.700 --> 24:23.168
MAX?

24:23.280 --> 24:26.420
ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE EATING THAT?

24:26.530 --> 24:29.146
ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE WATCHING THAT?

24:29.260 --> 24:31.490
I'M DOING A LOT OF THINGS
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.875
THE SYSTEM HAS BROKEN DOWN.
IT'S AMAZING.

24:33.980 --> 24:36.949
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHERE'S AMBER?

24:37.060 --> 24:38.436
THE DOG IS EATING
ICE CREAM, MAX.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.122
AMBER?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.642
- WE HAVE A CHILD!
- FINE!

24:43.750 --> 24:44.478
AMBER!

24:44.580 --> 24:48.061
[shushing]

24:48.170 --> 24:49.717
WHAT IS GOING ON?

24:49.830 --> 24:53.891
MAX IS DOWNSTAIRS,
HAVING, LIKE, A FEEDING FRENZY

24:54.000 --> 24:56.764
AND, LIKE, WATCHING ONE
OF THE CHUCKYMOVIES.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.282
OH, GREAT.
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

24:59.390 --> 25:00.834
HE SAID THE SYSTEM HAD
BROKEN DOWN.

25:00.940 --> 25:05.252
- THE WHOLE WORLD HAS--[gaSPS]
- IS SHE NOT SLEEPING?

25:05.360 --> 25:07.976
THE ONE THING THAT I
WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO LET HER DO

25:08.090 --> 25:08.988
WAS CLIMB INTO BED,

25:09.090 --> 25:11.365
AND--

25:11.470 --> 25:12.846
BUT SHE WAS, LIKE,
FREAKING OUT,

25:12.950 --> 25:14.394
AND IT WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT CALMED HER DOWN.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.193
AND THEN MAX JUST LOST IT

25:16.300 --> 25:18.359
BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET US
TO THE BOAT IN TIME.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.856
- I HAD--
- BOAT?

25:19.960 --> 25:21.643
I WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE HIM
TO ALCATRAZ.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.204
I HAD EVERYTHING--

25:23.310 --> 25:25.471
THOSE ARE BIG PLANS TO MAKE
WITH A LITTLE ONE AND MAX.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.921
BUT I'M GONNA
HAVE A LITTLE ONE,

25:27.040 --> 25:29.065
AND I COULDN'T EVEN GET
THE CAR SEAT TO GO IN MY CAR,

25:29.180 --> 25:30.442
- BECAUSE--
- WHY NOT?

25:30.560 --> 25:32.528
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
HAVE THE CLICKIES.

25:32.630 --> 25:33.858
- WHAT ARE THE CLICKIES?
- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO--

25:33.980 --> 25:35.698
IT'S SO EASY.
YOU CLICK THEM IN.

25:35.810 --> 25:37.141
MY CAR DOESN'T HAVE THAT.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.945
WELL, YOUR CAR'S OLD.

25:39.050 --> 25:40.358
I CAN'T HAVE A BABY

25:40.460 --> 25:42.428
IF I CAN'T PUT A CAR SEAT
IN MY OWN CAR.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.189
IT'S MY FAULT ANYWAY.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.949
I LET YOU WATCH FAST TIMES
AT RIDGEMONT HIGHTOO EARLY.

25:46.060 --> 25:47.220
WHAT?

25:47.330 --> 25:48.888
WE'LL GET YOU STARTED
WITH THE CLICKY THINGS,

25:48.990 --> 25:50.127
AND WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM THERE, OKAY?

25:50.230 --> 25:52.676
I JUST THOUGHT--

25:52.790 --> 25:55.611
I WANTED TODAY TO BE SO FUN,
AND IT JUST WAS, LIKE--

25:55.720 --> 25:58.655
YOU SHOULDN'T BE PUTTING
ALL THIS PRESSURE ON YOURSELF.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.034
THEY DON'T START OUT THIS AGE.

26:00.140 --> 26:02.347
THEY DON'T START OUT
AS BIG AS MAX.

26:02.450 --> 26:03.792
THEY START OUT LITTLE AND TINY,

26:03.900 --> 26:06.414
AND THEY DON'T TALK
OR DO ANYTHING EXCEPT POO.

26:06.530 --> 26:08.669
YOU CAN HANDLE THAT.

26:08.770 --> 26:10.419
I CAN DEFINITELY HANDLE POO
AFTER TODAY.

26:10.530 --> 26:11.974
AND EVENTUALLY,

26:12.080 --> 26:15.777
YOU WORK YOUR WAY UP
TO DEALING WITH INSANITY.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.188
LOOK, YOU GOT HER SLEEPING.

26:17.290 --> 26:19.633
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

26:22.400 --> 26:26.848
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M REALLY GONNA DO THIS ALONE.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.235
EXCUSE ME?

26:29.340 --> 26:31.262
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT ALONE.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.235
TINY BREATHING.

26:36.350 --> 26:38.580
[chuckles]

26:54.300 --> 26:56.632
[doorbell chimes]

27:02.860 --> 27:05.545
- HEY.
- HI.

27:05.650 --> 27:08.278
WE'RE STILL ON FOR 8:00,
RIGHT? NO?

27:08.380 --> 27:09.586
YES, WE ARE.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.066
WE ABSOLUTELY ARE.

27:11.180 --> 27:14.889
I'M--I COMPLETELY LOST TRACK
OF TIME.

27:15.010 --> 27:17.558
LET ME PUT SOMETHING ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.524
YOU OKAY?

27:19.630 --> 27:21.905
YEAH, YEAH, I'M, UM--

27:22.010 --> 27:24.945
YEAH?

27:25.050 --> 27:28.395
I JUST GOT MY DIVORCE
PAPERS TODAY.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.252
OH, WOW, I'M SO SORRY.

27:30.370 --> 27:32.952
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT
THING TO SAY IS.

27:33.060 --> 27:34.152
NO, IT'S OKAY.

27:34.270 --> 27:37.239
I--IT'S JUST HITTING ME HARDER
THAN I EXPECTED.

27:37.340 --> 27:38.784
YEAH.

27:38.890 --> 27:42.474
BUT I'M FINE,
SO LET ME JUST CHANGE AND--

27:42.590 --> 27:44.205
LOOK, WE DON'T--
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.039
REALLY, IT'S OKAY.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.129
IT'S OKAY
IF YOU WANT TO BE ALONE.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.410
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.863
UH...

27:55.120 --> 27:58.635
THERE'S NO REASON ANYMORE
WHY YOU SHOULDN'T COME IN.

27:58.740 --> 27:59.968
YOU SURE?

28:13.380 --> 28:16.964
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT IT
TO HAPPEN SO FAST.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.799
THE MEDIATION WENT SO SMOOTHLY,
YOU KNOW?

28:18.900 --> 28:20.891
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THERE'S THIS MESSENGER KID

28:21.000 --> 28:23.719
ON MY DOORSTEP
WITH THE PAPERS,

28:23.840 --> 28:26.308
AND AS SOON AS I SIGN THEM,

28:26.420 --> 28:28.866
MY MARRIAGE IS OVER.

28:30.570 --> 28:32.879
[exhales]

28:32.980 --> 28:35.733
I'M SORRY.
THIS IS AN AWKWARD TOPIC.

28:35.850 --> 28:37.078
LOOK, JULES, THIS IS JUST

28:37.190 --> 28:38.532
WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR LIFE
RIGHT NOW, ALL RIGHT?

28:38.640 --> 28:39.811
I GET IT.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.603
I GET IT, SO JUST--

28:41.720 --> 28:43.335
TOP ME OFF WITH SOME WINE.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.852
MM.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.997
TELL ME ABOUT THE HOUSE.
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE HOUSE?

28:49.100 --> 28:50.203
OH, NO.

28:50.310 --> 28:52.892
NO, I--NO, I'M SO SORRY.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.342
- CHRIS--
- I AM SO SORRY.

28:54.450 --> 28:56.133
I SHOULDN'T HAVE JUST
BLURTED IT OUT LIKE THAT.

28:56.250 --> 28:59.003
- CHRIS, I GOT THE HOUSE.
- YOU GOT THE HOUSE?

28:59.110 --> 29:00.486
- I GOT THE HOUSE.
- REALLY?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.591
YEAH.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.383
WOW, THE--
YOU GOT THE WHOLE THING?

29:04.500 --> 29:06.661
YEAH, ALL OF IT.

29:06.770 --> 29:08.419
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- I KNOW.

29:08.530 --> 29:09.497
IT'S A PRETTY NICE HOUSE.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.488
IT IS A NICE HOUSE.

29:11.610 --> 29:14.056
YEP.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.025
MY HOUSE.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.098
ALL MINE.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.577
SHOULDN'T YOU BE HAPPY
ABOUT THAT?

29:20.680 --> 29:22.193
IT'S JUST SO WEIRD.

29:22.310 --> 29:23.993
I WAS COMPLETELY PREPARED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

29:24.100 --> 29:25.476
AND NOW I GET TO STAY.

29:25.590 --> 29:28.923
AND SO I'M--

29:29.040 --> 29:33.830
I'M JUST HERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF ALL THESE MEMORIES, YOU KNOW?

29:36.110 --> 29:38.806
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- YEAH?

29:38.910 --> 29:40.070
HERE'S TO NEW MEMORIES.

29:40.190 --> 29:43.421
ASIAM

29:44.780 --> 29:49.433
TAKE ALL THAT I HAVE

29:49.540 --> 29:52.714
YOU KNOW, IF I FINISH
THIS GLASS OF WINE,

29:52.820 --> 29:55.471
I'M GONNA BE TOO DRUNK TO DRIVE.

29:59.790 --> 30:03.658
TAKE ALL THAT I HAVE

30:03.760 --> 30:04.681
THAT'S A GOOD CALL.

30:04.800 --> 30:08.725
I'M PRETTY TIRED MYSELF.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.479
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL IT A NIGHT.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.352
YEAH.

30:14.770 --> 30:18.285
TAKE ALL

30:18.400 --> 30:22.325
TAKE ALL

30:22.440 --> 30:29.096
TAKE ME AS I AM

30:31.340 --> 30:34.468
[knocking on door]

30:34.590 --> 30:36.854
- HEY.
- HEY.

30:36.970 --> 30:38.551
WHAT IS IT NOW, HANK?

30:38.660 --> 30:42.699
OKAY, SARAH ISN'T GONNA
REPLACE YOU IN RUBY'S LIFE.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.789
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

30:43.910 --> 30:46.629
I'M RUBY'S MOTHER.

30:46.740 --> 30:48.799
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

30:48.910 --> 30:52.016
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
AS LONG AS YOU GET THAT, THEN--

30:52.120 --> 30:53.155
THEN WE'RE GOOD, I GUESS.

30:53.260 --> 30:54.909
- OKAY.
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:55.020 --> 30:55.805
MAYBE WE'RE NOT GOOD.
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.433
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE SAYING

30:57.540 --> 30:59.599
THAT THE ISSUE IS SETTLED,
BUT MAYBE YOU DON'T MEAN IT--

30:59.710 --> 31:00.745
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:00.850 --> 31:02.329
ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK A
FIGHT WITH ME?

31:02.440 --> 31:03.646
NO, NO, I'M NOT TRYING TO
FIGHT. I'M NOT TRYING TO FIGHT.

31:03.750 --> 31:06.401
I JUST WANT TO--

31:06.510 --> 31:07.545
HERE'S THE THING.

31:07.650 --> 31:10.096
I RECENTLY HAVE REALIZED

31:10.210 --> 31:12.132
THAT I GUESS
I'M NOT GOOD AT COMMUNICATING.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.684
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE JUST REALIZING THIS NOW?

31:13.800 --> 31:15.415
I'VE ONLY BEEN TELLING
YOU FOR 18 YEARS.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.147
I KNOW,
AND I'VE BEEN
JUST THINKING

31:17.250 --> 31:20.048
THAT YOU WERE
SOME OVERSENSITIVE, UH,

31:20.150 --> 31:21.833
WELL, SHREW, I GUESS.

31:21.940 --> 31:22.804
WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT--

31:22.910 --> 31:25.708
I MEAN, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

31:25.810 --> 31:29.769
I'M--
I SUCK AT THIS.

31:29.880 --> 31:34.579
OKAY, I'M TRYING TO SAY
THAT YOU--

31:34.680 --> 31:38.855
YOU WEREN'T THE PROBLEM.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.235
HERE'S THE THING.
I'M SEEING THIS GUY, AND--

31:41.340 --> 31:42.409
WHAT?

31:42.520 --> 31:44.476
NOT SEE--NOT SEEING A GUY.

31:44.590 --> 31:46.581
I'M TALKING TO A--THIS GUY.

31:46.690 --> 31:48.373
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL.
HE'S A SHRINK.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.867
HE'S--HE SPECIALIZES IN PEOPLE
LIKE ME.

31:50.970 --> 31:52.767
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
PEOPLE LIKE YOU?

31:52.870 --> 31:54.667
PEOPLE LIKE ME.
PEOPLE WHO JUST--

31:54.770 --> 31:57.625
THEY'RE JUST NOT SO GOOD
WITH EMOTIONS, STUFF LIKE THAT,

31:57.740 --> 31:59.799
AND UNDERSTANDING FEELINGS--

31:59.910 --> 32:01.468
WHATEVER.
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING.

32:01.570 --> 32:02.912
HE THINKS THAT IT'S, LIKE,

32:03.020 --> 32:05.568
A JUMP BALL WHETHER I HAVE IT
OR NOT, BUT LATELY,

32:05.680 --> 32:06.567
I'M REALIZING IT'S NOT.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.954
IT'S NOT A JUMP BALL.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.028
IN FACT, I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S A SLAM DUNK.

32:10.130 --> 32:12.815
I GOT ASPERGER'S.

32:12.930 --> 32:16.206
THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

32:16.310 --> 32:19.780
IT'S--IT'S HIGH FUNCTIONING
AUTISM--THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

32:19.900 --> 32:23.347
NO, I--I KNOW.

32:23.450 --> 32:25.930
I KNOW.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.929
I-I HAD NO IDEA.

32:29.050 --> 32:31.905
I'M--I'M--

32:32.010 --> 32:33.523
I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

32:33.640 --> 32:35.084
SO LOOKING BACK,

32:35.190 --> 32:40.014
I THINK THAT, PROBABLY,
A LOT OF THE STUFF WAS ME.

32:40.130 --> 32:42.394
IT WASN'T YOU.

32:42.510 --> 32:47.163
AND, UH, I'M STARTING
TO GET THAT, YOU KNOW,

32:47.270 --> 32:51.161
IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD TO,

32:51.270 --> 32:54.068
YOU KNOW, BE MARRIED TO ME.

32:58.630 --> 33:00.200
WAS IT?

33:03.910 --> 33:07.562
YEAH.

33:07.670 --> 33:10.662
YEAH, YEAH.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.908
I WISH I WOULD'VE KNOWN.

33:14.020 --> 33:16.432
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
ME TOO.

33:16.540 --> 33:19.987
BUT LOOK, IN ANY CASE, I'M GONNA
TRY HARDER NOW WITH RUBY,

33:20.100 --> 33:21.954
AND THAT'LL BE GOOD.

33:22.060 --> 33:24.574
AND YOU TOO.
SO--

33:24.690 --> 33:26.271
THANK YOU.

33:26.380 --> 33:27.824
OKAY, SO WE'RE GOOD.
RIGHT?

33:27.930 --> 33:29.545
YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.

33:29.660 --> 33:33.517
ALL RIGHT.
BUT ARE WE REALLY GOOD?

33:33.630 --> 33:37.999
BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT GOOD, WHAT
YOU'VE GOT TO DO NOW IS, YOU'VE
GOT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC.

33:38.110 --> 33:38.929
- OKAY.
- 'CAUSE THAT HELPS.

33:39.050 --> 33:40.699
I CAN DO THAT.

33:40.810 --> 33:44.519
KAZMIR STARING DOWN
THAT--THAT GUY FROM THE ROYALS--

33:44.640 --> 33:47.427
I MEAN, THAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT
OF THE WHOLE SEASON, HANDS DOWN.

33:47.540 --> 33:51.704
YEAH, WELL, IT'S LIKE
TIME SHOULD'VE STOPPED,

33:51.820 --> 33:53.299
YOU KNOW?

33:53.410 --> 33:54.889
KID SHOULD'VE DROPPED THE BAT
AND LEFT THE FIELD.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.025
HE BASICALLY DID.

33:56.130 --> 33:57.233
[both laugh]

33:57.340 --> 33:58.819
SEE, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

33:58.930 --> 34:00.261
I'M ENJOYING THE HELL
OUT OF THIS.

34:00.380 --> 34:02.439
YOU KNOW, I COULD TALK BASEBALL
ALL NIGHT LONG,

34:02.550 --> 34:08.136
BUT I GOT A SNEAKING SUSPICION
THAT'S NOT WHY YOU'RE HERE,

34:08.250 --> 34:10.866
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?

34:10.970 --> 34:12.904
[laughs]

34:13.010 --> 34:15.353
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

34:15.460 --> 34:19.214
I JUST REMEMBER YOU USED TO JUST
INTIMIDATE THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

34:19.330 --> 34:20.228
ME?

34:20.330 --> 34:22.742
YOU'RE SO HARMLESS NOW.

34:22.850 --> 34:25.364
AND I'VE GOTTEN IN TOUCH
WITH MY FEMININE SIDE PLENTY.

34:25.470 --> 34:26.539
AND IT SHOWS.

34:26.650 --> 34:27.605
- DOES IT?
- REALLY.

34:27.720 --> 34:30.951
- PROBABLY IN THE WALK.
- DEFINITELY.

34:31.060 --> 34:32.436
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:34.760 --> 34:39.231
I, UH--

34:39.350 --> 34:42.820
I'M SAYING GOOD-BYE, ZEEK.

34:42.940 --> 34:46.319
WHAT?

34:46.420 --> 34:49.389
I NEVER HAD A ROLE MODEL.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.525
GROWING UP, I NEVER HAD THAT.

34:51.640 --> 34:53.596
AND...

34:57.880 --> 34:58.869
I THINK
YOU WERE THAT FOR ME,

34:58.990 --> 35:00.389
SO I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU,

35:00.510 --> 35:02.649
AND I'M GONNA MISS YOU,

35:02.750 --> 35:04.809
AND I'M GONNA MISS--

35:04.930 --> 35:06.022
I'M GONNA MISS YOUR FAMILY.

35:06.130 --> 35:07.779
THAT'S IT?
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE?

35:07.890 --> 35:10.233
YEAH.

35:10.340 --> 35:15.107
I MEAN, WE FINISHED UP MEDIATION
THIS WEEK, SO--

35:15.210 --> 35:16.757
SO YOU'RE DONE?

35:16.870 --> 35:19.384
YEAH.

35:19.490 --> 35:21.071
I CAN'T KEEP DRAGGING THIS ON,
YOU KNOW?

35:21.180 --> 35:22.078
I GOT TO LET HER GO.

35:22.180 --> 35:25.729
YEAH.

35:25.840 --> 35:29.913
JUST GIVING UP?

35:30.020 --> 35:32.671
- I'M NOT GIVING UP.
- YEAH, YOU ARE.

35:32.780 --> 35:33.917
NO, I'M NOT.
I'M NOT.

35:34.020 --> 35:35.396
THIS IS WHAT SHE WANTED.

35:35.510 --> 35:37.330
THIS IS WHAT SHE WANTED.
I'M TRYING TO HONOR THAT.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.362
THIS IS WHAT YOUR
DAUGHTER WANTED.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.027
CAN YOU PLEASE JUST LET ME
GET OUT OF HERE

35:41.130 --> 35:44.304
WITH SOME SENSE OF DIGNITY?

35:44.410 --> 35:46.822
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

35:53.730 --> 35:54.970
YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS?

35:55.080 --> 35:56.695
COME ON.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.836
HMM?

35:58.940 --> 36:00.703
YOU LOVE YOUR KIDS?

36:33.880 --> 36:37.008
OKAY, YOU LOVE HER?

36:40.750 --> 36:43.776
YOU FIGHT FOR HER.

36:43.890 --> 36:45.676
DON'T LEAVE.

36:50.650 --> 36:52.891
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO KEEP WATCHING IT.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.024
I CAN'T LET YOU WIN.
YOU KNOW THAT.

36:54.140 --> 36:54.925
[knocking on door]
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.759

OH, OKAY. THANKS.

37:10.780 --> 37:12.702

DAY PLANNED FOR US.

37:12.810 --> 37:14.869
OH, GOD, WHAT?

37:14.990 --> 37:16.150
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU MAKING ME DO?

37:16.260 --> 37:18.194
I'M MAKING YOU GO
TO YOGURTLAND.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.642

37:19.750 --> 37:22.196
OH, AND THAT'S, LIKE,
THIS REALLY BIG DAY?

37:22.300 --> 37:25.372
YEAH, IT IS, RUBY,

37:25.480 --> 37:28.995

THAT HAS TARO ROOT ON THE MENU.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.169
OH, COME ON. REALLY?

37:30.280 --> 37:31.827
OH. OH, MY GOD.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.586
- HERE? REALLY?
- IS THAT REALLY A FLAVOR?

37:35.700 --> 37:37.383
- DON'T MAKE FUN OF IT.
- OH, IT'S AMAZING, HONESTLY.

37:37.490 --> 37:39.731
DAD, YOU GOT IT THAT ONE TIME
BY ACCIDENT? THAN KS.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.000
YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T HAVE MY GLASSES.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.384
I THOUGHT IT WAS TOFFEE.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.081
BUT THEN WE TRIED IT,
AND NOW IT'S LIKE OUR CRACK.

37:45.190 --> 37:46.396

37:46.500 --> 37:48.297
WHAT STINKS IS, THEY TOOK IT
OUT OF THE ROTATION.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.606
- I KNOW.

37:49.710 --> 37:51.018
HEY, YOU SHOULD--

37:53.510 --> 37:55.432
MOM SHOULD--YOU KNOW,
YOU NEED TIME WITH HER.

37:55.540 --> 37:56.859
YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE

NO, NO, HANK, COME ON.
COME ON. COME WITH US.

37:58.820 --> 38:01.129
WE CAN ALL TALK

38:01.240 --> 38:03.060
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

38:03.170 --> 38:04.751
OH, SARAH.

38:08.450 --> 38:10.862
YOU DON'T MIND IF WE STEAL HIM

38:22.740 --> 38:24.014
ALL RIGHT,

38:24.120 --> 38:25.189
ALL RIGHT, COOL. BE RIGHT BACK.

38:25.300 --> 38:26.198

38:33.550 --> 38:35.199
WOW.

38:35.310 --> 38:35.878
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:36.000 --> 38:36.989
HUH?

38:37.100 --> 38:38.476
- YOU'RE EATING A COOKIE?
- YEAH, I'M EATING A COOKIE.

38:38.590 --> 38:40.546
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO EAT THAT, RIGHT?

38:40.660 --> 38:41.968
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO EAT IT?

38:42.070 --> 38:44.004

38:44.110 --> 38:46.249
OH, I'M NOT--IT'S

38:47.250 --> 38:48.387
IT'S A JAILBREAK.

39:14.730 --> 39:16.061
THANK YOU.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.171
HE SAID IT WAS TOO MESSY,
BUT I TOLD HIM HOW OLD YOU WERE,

39:18.280 --> 39:20.077
SO THEY ASSUMED YOU WOULDN'T
HIT ANYTHING, SO THEY LET ME.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.489
HMM, WELL,
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.249
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE FIRST
SHOT, AREN'T YOU?

39:24.360 --> 39:26.908
NO, I'M--I'M ROOTING YOU ON.

GRANDSON, THIS IS
SUCH A GREAT TREAT FOR ME,

AND WE CAME ALL THIS WAY.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.043
NOW, HUMOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

39:32.160 --> 39:33.536
THE FIRST LESSON HERE IS,

39:33.640 --> 39:36.461
- OF COURSE, SAFETY, OKAY?
- ALL RIGHT.

39:36.580 --> 39:38.229
AND YOU'RE DEALING
WITH A WEAPON.

39:38.340 --> 39:42.959
IT'S GOT TO BE HANDLED LIKE IT'S
A DANGEROUS, BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

39:43.070 --> 39:44.640
- WOW.
- ALL RIGHT?

39:44.760 --> 39:46.443
NOW, ARE YOU RIGHT-HANDED
OR LEFT-HANDED?

39:48.860 --> 39:50.930

PUT YOUR INDEX FINGER
ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WEAPON.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.313
THAT'S IT.

39:55.420 --> 39:57.661
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE SAFETY--

39:57.770 --> 40:00.113
REACH OUT AND TOUCH

40:00.220 --> 40:04.156
WITH MY HANDS

40:04.260 --> 40:07.013
I CAN'T TAKE MY EYES

40:07.120 --> 40:11.602
OFF THE EDGE

40:11.710 --> 40:17.398
'CAUSE STAYING HERE
JUST SCARES ME TO DEATH

40:17.510 --> 40:22.823
AND I WISH
I KNEW A WAY

40:22.930 --> 40:26.036
TO TELL YOU
WHERE I'VE BEEN

40:26.140 --> 40:31.009
[indistinct chatter]

40:31.110 --> 40:35.217
WHEN EVERY LITTLE MOMENT
PASSING

40:35.320 --> 40:40.257
IS A QUESTION ASKING ME

40:40.360 --> 40:44.057
ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME

40:44.160 --> 40:48.051
WAITING FOR SIGNS?

40:49.720 --> 40:52.473
WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP?

40:56.590 --> 40:59.104
WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP?

41:03.560 --> 41:08.520
WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP?

41:10.460 --> 41:15.807
WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP?

41:17.330 --> 41:24.406
WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP?

41:24.510 --> 41:31.609
WOULD YOU
GIVE IT UP?

41:32.900 --> 41:35.243
WOULD YOU GIVE IT UP?

41:35.350 --> 41:36.897
HEY, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

41:37.010 --> 41:41.174
A YEAR AGO,
YOU ASKED ME
TO FIGHT FOR YOU,

41:41.290 --> 41:44.805
AND I WAS TOO STUPID TO LISTEN.

41:44.910 --> 41:47.879
SO I'M HERE.

41:47.980 --> 41:50.540
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANOTHER
DAY WITHOUT YOU,

41:50.640 --> 41:53.985
JULIA, NOT ANOTHER SECOND.

41:54.090 --> 41:55.569
SO I'M FIGHTING FOR YOU,

41:55.680 --> 42:00.401
AND I'M FIGHTING
FOR OUR MARRIAGE.

42:00.510 --> 42:03.308
I WANT YOU BACK.

42:45.520 --> 42:46.760
[dog barks]
