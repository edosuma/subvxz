WEBVTT

00:28.611 --> 00:29.529
[Doc] Lilly?

00:30.238 --> 00:31.614
-I called Mel.
-[Doc] Lilly?

00:31.698 --> 00:33.616
I'm in here, Doc! We're in here!

00:34.200 --> 00:36.494
[Lilly] Thank God you're here.
She had a seizure.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.704
[Doc] She has epilepsy.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.707
Yeah. It's been at least five years
since her last episode.

00:41.875 --> 00:42.709
Did you time it?

00:42.792 --> 00:45.253
I think it was 90 seconds,
and then I heard her fall.

00:45.336 --> 00:48.089
-[Lilly] I'm afraid she hit her head.
-What is she taking?

00:48.173 --> 00:50.633
-Lamotrigine. Fifty milligrams a day.
-[Lilly] Yeah.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.554
Okay. Tara? Can you hear me? It's Mel.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.140
Doc's just gonna take your blood pressure,
all right?

00:57.223 --> 00:58.308
What happened?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.060
Where am I?

01:00.143 --> 01:03.146
[Doc] You're at home, honey.
You had a seizure.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.273
[groans quietly]

01:05.356 --> 01:08.109
-Where's my mom?
-I'm here, baby. Right here, sweetie.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.779
-And Mel and Doc are taking care of you.
-[Mel mouths]

01:10.862 --> 01:11.988
-Hey, Lilly.
-[Lilly] Hm?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.240
Why don't we go make coffee for everyone?

01:14.324 --> 01:15.950
-It's okay. We got her.
-Okay.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.744
Her vitals are stable.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.246
Okay. [clears throat]

01:20.330 --> 01:22.791
-Do you wanna try sitting up, sweetheart?
-Mm-hmm.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.585
-Here we go.
-[Tara groans]

01:26.377 --> 01:29.047
[Mel] All right. How are you feeling?
Are you dizzy at all?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.800
-No.
-Okay. Do you feel nauseous?

01:32.550 --> 01:33.468
[exhales slowly]

01:33.551 --> 01:35.929
[Mel] How's your head feel?
Do you have a headache?

01:36.679 --> 01:39.057
No? I'm just gonna feel your head

01:39.849 --> 01:42.811
and see if you have any bumps, okay?

01:43.853 --> 01:46.981
All right, sweetheart.
I don't think that you have a concussion,

01:47.482 --> 01:48.441
but just to be safe,

01:48.525 --> 01:52.320
I'm gonna have Lilly wake you up
every few hours throughout the night.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.697
-[Tara sighs quietly]
-All right. You're okay.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.616
I'm gonna go talk to Doc, okay?

01:59.160 --> 02:00.954
Here, let's get you a blanket.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.876
[quietly] So what's her history?

02:06.960 --> 02:10.630
It's primarily tonic, but I have seen
some absence seizures too.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.425
We think it started with a bad fever
when she was an infant,

02:14.509 --> 02:17.512
and fortunately,
her medications are very effective.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.639
-You think stress triggered it?
-Most likely.

02:19.722 --> 02:20.765
[Mel] Yeah.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.433
[Mel] Oh God. Poor thing.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.228
She's probably so overwhelmed
with Lilly's cancer

02:25.311 --> 02:26.938
and having to take care of Chloe.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.607
We need a plan to get them support ASAP.

02:29.691 --> 02:33.444
Otherwise, Tara's seizures
are gonna increase in frequency.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.362
Yeah.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.281
This is all my fault.

02:37.782 --> 02:40.743
Stress is one of Tara's triggers,
and, um--

02:41.786 --> 02:44.622
Well, we were in the car
talking about my cancer,

02:45.665 --> 02:47.333
and we came home, she had a seizure.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.586
Hey, hey, no. Lilly, come on.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.838
You can't blame yourself, okay?

02:53.798 --> 02:55.175
[baby cries]

02:55.258 --> 02:57.051
I'll… I'll take care of Chloe.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.971
-Thank you.
-[Jack] Everything's gonna be just fine.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.433
[Chloe cries]

03:03.516 --> 03:05.143
[quietly] I wish that were true.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.939
[Chloe cries]

03:10.023 --> 03:11.774
[softly] Oh, hey.

03:11.858 --> 03:14.569
Hey! Oh, Chloe.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.572
Hey. Oh.

03:17.655 --> 03:19.532
[Chloe cries]

03:19.616 --> 03:23.077
Did all the people in your house
wake you up? Hm?

03:23.161 --> 03:25.997
Those naughty people. Oh, that's no good!

03:26.664 --> 03:29.709
-[Chloe cries]
-It's okay. Come on.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.880
-[Chloe cries]
-Okay. Okay.

03:34.923 --> 03:35.840
It's all right.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.760
[sing-song] What do you need?
What do you need?

03:38.843 --> 03:39.886
Do you need that?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.346
Isn't that pretty?

03:41.429 --> 03:42.764
-[Chloe whimpers]
-No?

03:42.847 --> 03:43.806
Okay.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.058
[Chloe fusses]

03:45.141 --> 03:46.017
Yeah?

03:46.559 --> 03:47.727
Close your eyes.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.773
-[Chloe cries]
-Okay, okay. You're not ready.

03:52.523 --> 03:55.318
-[Chloe cries]
-Okay, okay.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.489
-Oh, you're not ready. You're not ready.
-[Chloe cries]

03:59.572 --> 04:01.157
Well, you wanna know something?

04:01.866 --> 04:04.494
When it comes to all of this,
I'm not ready either.

04:04.577 --> 04:06.746
-[Chloe cries]
-Okay? Don't tell anyone.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.957
Okay.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.668
[Chloe cries]

04:12.710 --> 04:16.756
[theme music playing]

04:34.065 --> 04:35.525
-[Jack exhales]
-[Mel] I'm sorry.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.070
-I didn't mean to wake you up.
-It's okay. What time is it?

04:39.696 --> 04:41.072
It's early.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.119
I didn't think you were leaving for LA
till tomorrow?

04:46.703 --> 04:50.248
Um, I'm not.
I just, uh, got a lot to do today.

04:50.331 --> 04:53.334
[groans] Baby, I feel like before you go,

04:53.418 --> 04:55.628
I gotta explain
why I'm not going with you.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.088
No, it's fine.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.299
Can't leave the bar.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.969
-[Mel] I totally get it.
-No, no. It's not just that.

05:04.554 --> 05:09.100
Look, I want our first trip away together
to be special, you know?

05:09.642 --> 05:11.269
I want it to be about us,

05:12.395 --> 05:15.565
not your sister's divorce.
Believe it or not.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.235
-Makes sense.
-Mm.

05:19.819 --> 05:21.738
-You look a little tired.
-[groans]

05:21.821 --> 05:24.824
-You should come back to bed.
-I told you I have a lot to do today.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.493
-Oh yeah, but come on. It's not even 7:00.
-Aw.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.541
-Aw, you're not making this easy.
-Oh really?

05:34.208 --> 05:35.043
Good.

05:35.877 --> 05:37.253
I just want attention.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.596
[sighs]

05:47.513 --> 05:49.640
-Hey.
-Where's Christopher?

05:49.724 --> 05:52.060
He's, uh, playing with Tucker.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.144
Charmaine's dog?

05:53.227 --> 05:56.647
Yeah. There's some sort of issue,
so Jack took him in.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.400
Oh. So you're already dog-sitting.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.860
You are a saint.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.779
Well, actually,

06:02.862 --> 06:06.449
we offered to look after Tucker
when Jack went to Lilly's.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.993
-Uh-huh?
-Christopher took one look at that dog.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.622
-[chuckles] It was love at first sight.
-Didn't have the heart to say no?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.916
-Pretty much.
-You're an old softie.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.336
But I think it's good. You know?
Christopher could use a buddy.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.171
-Yeah, I thought so.
-Mm-hmm.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.798
-[cell phones ping]
-Oh.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.010
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.263
-They're canceling the camp play.
-Why can't they find another director?

06:29.347 --> 06:32.100
-Christopher worked his tail off.
-Yeah, I know.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.394
-He's gonna be devastated.
-Not on my watch.

06:34.477 --> 06:38.856
-I'll call over there and take care of it.
-No, you don't have to do that.

06:38.940 --> 06:39.857
Well, I don't mind.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.443
Connie, you have been doing
so much work around here.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.445
I feel like we're taking advantage of you.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.864
[spluttering] Are you saying
you don't want my help?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.575
Because you certainly can't do this
all by yourself.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.036
No, not exactly. It's just…

06:52.120 --> 06:56.124
Look, I'm just… just worried
that eventually you're gonna resent me.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.208
I see.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.210
I thought you'd be relieved.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.254
[flat] I am.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.047
Yeah.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.633
Wonderful not to be needed.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.719
[door opens, then closes]

07:13.057 --> 07:14.892
I'm sorry, you said there's a spring?

07:14.976 --> 07:17.770
Yeah, and the source
is right under your lot, which means--

07:17.854 --> 07:19.522
I have to notify Fish and Wildlife.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.024
And get a survey done
and submit an LSA application,

07:22.108 --> 07:23.234
but it's not guaranteed.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.612
Wait, so how long
till he can break ground on the house?

07:26.696 --> 07:30.741
Anywhere between eight months and a year.
And that's if the permit gets approved.

07:30.825 --> 07:34.662
These environmental protection concerns
have led to a hold on building permits.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.832
Just-- Wait a second.
My house was built in 1954.

07:37.915 --> 07:41.377
Surely there's a grandfather clause
that would allow me to build before then.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.629
These days,
new construction requires a permit.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.049
So I gotta wait for up to a year
for a permit that I might not even get

07:47.133 --> 07:48.384
or sell and take a loss?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.511
Sorry. I wish I had better news for you.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.889
-Yeah.
-[surveyor sighs]

07:53.389 --> 07:57.685
Listen, I have other meetings,
so let me know what you guys decide, yeah?

07:58.686 --> 08:00.938
-Sure. Thanks for coming out, man.
-All right.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.356
See ya.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.986
[Jack sighs]

08:07.069 --> 08:09.489
Man, if I don't have a place
for the twins to stay,

08:09.572 --> 08:11.991
Charmaine's gonna use this
against me for sure.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.077
Um, how about Mel's?

08:15.995 --> 08:19.373
Yeah, that's fine at the beginning,
but if I want partial custody,

08:19.457 --> 08:21.667
the twins will have to have
their own bedroom.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.252
Then look for another place.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.837
Dude, with what cash?

08:24.921 --> 08:25.838
Sell the land?

08:25.922 --> 08:28.799
Come on. Who in their right mind
is gonna buy a residential lot

08:28.883 --> 08:32.303
knowing that they can't get
a building permit? I just--

08:34.472 --> 08:37.517
Man, I feel like the deck
is stacked against me, you know?

08:38.893 --> 08:39.769
[sighs]

08:39.852 --> 08:43.147
I keep trying to do the right thing,
and everywhere I turn, a roadblock.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.191
Come on, man. That's not the Jack I know.

08:45.274 --> 08:46.734
Well, it's how I feel.

08:48.903 --> 08:51.113
When we were serving,
remember what you'd say?

08:51.197 --> 08:54.033
The only way to fail is to quit.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.618
Yeah.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.122
I just don't feel like that guy anymore.

09:04.669 --> 09:05.962
[door opens]

09:09.590 --> 09:10.633
[door opens]

09:10.716 --> 09:12.552
Hey. There you are.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.932
-What are you doing out here?
-Hm, I've been up for a while.

09:18.015 --> 09:18.849
Oh.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.102
[Brady sighs]

09:21.852 --> 09:24.105
Oh, you're so warm.

09:24.188 --> 09:25.022
You cold?

09:25.106 --> 09:28.734
-Want me to grab your blanket?
-No. I wanna stay just like this.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.319
Mm. [kisses]

09:31.237 --> 09:33.823
[sighs happily]
Thanks for staying the night.

09:33.906 --> 09:34.865
[suspiciously] Oh.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.660
Is that a hint it's time for me to go?

09:38.703 --> 09:42.790
Actually, I was, uh,
hoping we could spend the day together.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.877
[cell phone vibrates]

09:48.045 --> 09:49.755
[Brady groans]

09:51.757 --> 09:52.675
Hello?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.264
Is that necessary?

09:59.974 --> 10:00.808
Fine.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.398
I gotta go to work.

10:08.107 --> 10:11.152
Don't worry about it.
Maybe we can see each other tonight?

10:12.028 --> 10:15.489
You know what? I have a better idea.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.407
Yeah? What?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.700
I'm not gonna be long.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.745
You stay here, I'll bring back breakfast.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.456
-Breakfast in bed?
-Mm-hmm.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.292
Anything you want.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.378
[chuckles softly] Where do I sign?

10:36.927 --> 10:39.055
-Don't move.
-[chuckles]

11:00.034 --> 11:01.661
[typing]

11:05.623 --> 11:06.957
[quietly] Oh, damn it.

11:08.376 --> 11:12.004
-[Ricky] Can I take your order?
-I didn't know you were working today.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.297
Why would you think that?

11:13.381 --> 11:16.592
I don't know. I was hoping
at least one thing would go right today.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.802
What's wrong?

11:18.469 --> 11:22.139
The internet is down at the B&B,
and it is crazy slow here. [sighs]

11:23.808 --> 11:27.144
So, are you, like,
never gonna speak to me again?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.314
I don't know.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.273
Lizzie.

11:32.983 --> 11:36.529
I feel like you have what you want,
and what I want doesn't matter.

11:38.114 --> 11:42.368
Living together is a huge jump
from being boyfriend-girlfriend.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.787
Listen. Hey.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.664
I love you,

11:47.581 --> 11:48.791
and I wanna be with you.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.086
Okay.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.588
I guess it is a big step.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.801
-Can we talk about it in the future?
-Sure.

12:00.428 --> 12:04.014
-You, uh, want me to get you some fries?
-Yes, please. Extra salt.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.891
-You got it.
-[Lizzie chuckles]

12:05.975 --> 12:07.518
Hey, um,

12:07.601 --> 12:11.313
who was that marine guy you were
talking to at the Lumberjack Games?

12:11.397 --> 12:14.191
Hm? Uh, just, uh,
some guy trying to recruit people.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.694
Really? It seemed like
you guys knew each other.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.739
-No.
-So you've never met him before?

12:21.741 --> 12:24.285
[whispers] Holy hell.
I think that guy's Granger Smith.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.619
Who's Granger Smith?

12:25.703 --> 12:27.037
Huge country music singer.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.497
-So he's famous?
-Heck yeah.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.508
[Ricky sighs]

12:40.634 --> 12:41.510
Hey, man.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.597
-Something going on with you and Lizzie?
-Why?

12:45.097 --> 12:47.975
I hate to tell you this,
but she's checking out that guy there.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.894
Oh. I told her that's Granger Smith.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.271
No, it's not.

12:52.772 --> 12:53.606
Yeah, I know.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.027
[Jack] Hm.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.370
[Preacher] Hey, I gotta drop by the camp.
Be back in an hour.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.290
All right. Can you swing by
the bakery truck on your way back?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.375
I told Connie we're running low on pies.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.585
Can't Ricky do it?

13:14.668 --> 13:17.421
Yeah, but isn't Christopher's camp
right by the truck?

13:17.505 --> 13:20.007
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess it is.

13:20.090 --> 13:20.966
So…

13:21.050 --> 13:25.763
So, it's just that Connie and I
had a misunderstanding this morning.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.017
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.393
[Preacher grunts]

13:31.477 --> 13:33.437
Don't worry about it.
I'll pick up the pies.

13:34.021 --> 13:35.397
No. I got it.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.192
You know, um,
gotta face the music some time.

13:38.275 --> 13:39.360
Might as well be now.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.697
[chuckles softly]

13:47.201 --> 13:48.953
Okay, so I have an idea.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.288
[Doc] Go on.

13:51.372 --> 13:56.752
Um, I'm thinking about creating
a care calendar to reduce Tara's stress.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.963
And how would that work?

13:59.046 --> 14:00.130
I'd create a schedule,

14:00.214 --> 14:03.217
and people can sign up for anything
that Lilly or Tara might need,

14:03.300 --> 14:07.972
like, um, running errands, babysitting,
bringing meals, that kind of stuff.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.431
That is a good idea.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.600
Thanks.
I'll run it by Lilly this afternoon.

14:12.226 --> 14:15.729
Oh, um, by the way, I wanna tell you,

14:16.564 --> 14:19.483
I have decided against
bringing in Dr. Hansen.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.570
Oh. I thought you liked her.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.197
She didn't seem like the right fit.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.074
Okay.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.202
Um,
are you gonna keep interviewing people?

14:30.286 --> 14:34.790
No. For now, I've decided to,
uh, put my search on hold.

14:35.749 --> 14:36.584
Okay.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.046
[sighs] Look,
I've been wanting to talk to you

14:41.130 --> 14:44.008
about how I told Jack you were retiring.

14:45.843 --> 14:46.844
What about it?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.804
Well, I just want to apologize.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.725
And I'm sorry that you feel like
I breached your confidence.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.896
The only reason I brought it up with him
was because I was caught off guard,

14:56.979 --> 14:58.856
and I needed to work out my feelings.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.566
I told him not to say anything,

15:00.649 --> 15:03.402
but you know Jack.
He was just trying to be protective.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.739
I'm not mad at Jack.
I know his intentions are good, and…

15:07.907 --> 15:11.410
-But you're still mad at me.
-I wouldn't say mad.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.453
I, uh…

15:12.536 --> 15:14.246
More like frustrated.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.247
Frustrated, how?

15:16.415 --> 15:20.252
I have worked 30 years alone

15:20.336 --> 15:22.087
to build this practice,

15:23.088 --> 15:28.677
and up until now, anything that had to do
with the work was strictly my business.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.056
Okay, so you feel like
being on your own was better.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.975
It was easier.
The only person I had to answer to was me.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.685
It's not about answering to me.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.521
It's just about having respect
for a colleague.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.858
I do respect you,
but it doesn't mean that I'm comfortable

15:42.942 --> 15:45.986
having you involved
in every aspect of my life.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.531
I'm not talking about every aspect.
I am just talking about the clinic.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.951
But this is what you gotta understand.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.535
The clinic, this clinic,

15:54.912 --> 15:56.413
this is my life!

16:05.214 --> 16:07.007
-[door opens]
-[Mel sighs]

16:07.633 --> 16:08.801
[door closes]

16:13.681 --> 16:16.266
I looked him up. That's not Granger Smith.

16:16.350 --> 16:19.645
Oh. I guess not. Oh well. [chuckles]

16:19.728 --> 16:20.980
Thanks for the fries.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.149
So, are we okay?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.194
Yeah, but I gotta get to work.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.365
I love you, dummy.

16:31.448 --> 16:32.408
[chuckling]

16:52.720 --> 16:53.679
[sighs]

17:12.740 --> 17:13.949
Why the hell am I here?

17:14.908 --> 17:17.578
I just need to clarify a few things
in your statement.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.581
Where were you the night of the shooting?

17:20.664 --> 17:23.292
I was at Juvy's. Bea vouched for me.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.835
She's amended her timeline.

17:26.045 --> 17:29.381
There's now two hours
where you're unaccounted for,

17:29.465 --> 17:31.717
which is plenty of time to do that.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.430
You actually think I shot Jack?

17:37.181 --> 17:39.558
I don't know, Brady. You tell me.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.106
Why would I do something like that?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.485
When Calvin first hired you,

17:50.652 --> 17:54.323
within a couple weeks, most of his assets
were transferred into your name.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.533
Then Jack turns the cops
onto the fentanyl,

17:56.617 --> 17:59.411
but to take Calvin down,
we needed someone on the inside.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.329
You show up.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.540
You give us a date and a location
to score the evidence that we need.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.168
But when we get there,
the operation's cleared out.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.419
Now, Calvin doesn't know

18:07.503 --> 18:09.838
that you were the informant
that triggered the raid.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.465
Otherwise, you'd be dead by now.

18:12.216 --> 18:15.886
But he knows that you let Spencer live.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.974
So, to save yourself,
you needed to make it up to him

18:22.101 --> 18:23.227
by getting rid of Jack.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.022
[whistles]

18:27.898 --> 18:28.816
[sighs]

18:31.568 --> 18:32.945
That's a bunch of crap.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.449
And I'm not saying anything more
until I got a lawyer.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.492
Good call.

18:39.993 --> 18:40.869
So…

18:43.080 --> 18:43.914
am I free to go?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.458
Yeah.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.876
Just don't leave town,

18:49.545 --> 18:50.671
and stay away from Jack.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.653
Oh.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.406
-[Jack] Does somebody need a coffee?
-Yeah.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.615
To go, please.

19:18.699 --> 19:22.786
-You having a rough morning too?
-Doc is frustrated with me.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.080
-What, more than usual?
-[scoffs] Yeah.

19:25.164 --> 19:29.251
Don't know. Something's going on with him.
I just can't figure out what it is.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.378
Well, he's probably upset about Lilly.

19:31.461 --> 19:34.673
Sure, but he's been acting like this
for a while.

19:34.756 --> 19:37.342
-Hm.
-[Mel] So, what's going on with you?

19:38.010 --> 19:42.472
Oh, just-- There's an issue
with getting a permit to rebuild my house.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.808
Ugh, I'm sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.894
Not unless you know how
to relocate an aquifer.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.061
I do not.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.062
How about some food?

19:49.146 --> 19:52.649
Oh, no, just the coffee, thanks.
I'm on my way out to see Lilly.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.360
All right. What time we doing dinner?

19:55.444 --> 19:56.570
[Mel] I'm not sure yet.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.448
Between the scheduling,
submitting insurance forms,

19:59.531 --> 20:01.783
and charting,
my day is just kind of packed.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.787
Yeah. Well, just try to imagine
doing all that with a baby in the mix.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.290
[scoffs] Wow.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.670
-What?
-What is that supposed to mean?

20:14.588 --> 20:17.925
-Nothing.
-It's gonna be easier if you just tell me.

20:18.008 --> 20:20.219
No, nothing. Really. It was just--

20:20.802 --> 20:22.387
I was with Chloe last night,

20:22.471 --> 20:25.599
and every time I put her down,
she starts crying again.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.267
I had to hold her the whole time.

20:29.186 --> 20:32.064
Trying to imagine doing that with two.

20:32.147 --> 20:33.774
It's… it's a lot.

20:33.857 --> 20:38.612
I think if you really want something,
you figure out how to make it work.

20:39.196 --> 20:43.325
Just, where's the breaking point?
There's only so many hours in the day.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.161
Well, only you know your limit.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.458
Yeah. I just don't wanna
bite off more than I can chew.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.588
I'm sorry. I didn't really wanna
have this discussion here.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.675
Yeah, but, I mean,
I do wanna know what you're thinking.

21:00.842 --> 21:04.096
-Even if it's not what you wanna hear?
-Of course.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.597
Okay.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.057
I gotta go.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.102
I'll bring food home from the bar.
We can eat whenever you want.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.687
-That sounds good.
-Good.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.355
-Thanks for the coffee.
-Yeah.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.607
Well, tell Lilly I said hi.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.566
I will.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.619
[children shouting]

21:27.703 --> 21:29.705
Wanna practice our lines?

21:29.788 --> 21:30.664
Sure.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.627
Preach! What are you doing here?

21:35.711 --> 21:36.545
Hey!

21:37.170 --> 21:39.673
I heard you're looking for a director.

21:39.756 --> 21:40.757
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.718
You're the best!

21:42.801 --> 21:45.137
-[laughs]
-They told us the play might get canceled.

21:45.220 --> 21:48.724
Oh, not while I'm on duty. Hey, Owen.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.854
[children laugh and shout]

21:54.730 --> 21:56.690
-[Preacher whistles]
-[children quiet down]

21:56.773 --> 21:57.816
Okay, everyone.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.651
Let's grab a seat.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.781
All right.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.700
Now, my name is John.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.952
Everyone calls me Preacher.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.581
So I am the new director.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.624
What happened to Dave?

22:14.708 --> 22:15.542
Is he dead?

22:15.625 --> 22:17.502
No. No, Dave is not dead.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.796
He just has a family emergency.

22:19.880 --> 22:24.801
All right. So our mission is
to perform The Wizard of Oz.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.636
You look like an Avenger.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.681
-He's a marine.
-Whoa! Have you ever killed anyone before?

22:29.765 --> 22:33.018
Hey, how about we just,
you know, focus on the play?

22:33.101 --> 22:35.395
-Um, we don't know what to do.
-All right.

22:35.479 --> 22:39.608
Well, who here, besides Christopher,
knows their lines? Hm?

22:42.903 --> 22:45.655
Okay. Then that's where we'll start.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.908
When will we learn the songs?

22:50.327 --> 22:52.120
-Songs?
-[Christopher] Yeah.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.546
[Mel] So you're good with the calendar?

23:01.630 --> 23:04.216
Yeah, if it'll make things easier
for Tara. Absolutely.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.051
Great. We'll set it up.

23:06.134 --> 23:07.761
Also, um,

23:08.512 --> 23:12.766
you know, there are support groups
for people dealing with terminal illness.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.852
Ah. Well, I'll suggest the idea to Tara.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.522
Support group isn't for me.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.148
Right.

23:21.024 --> 23:24.820
Well, bottling up your feelings
can make things harder.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.531
It's not that.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.284
Knowing I'll see Buck…

23:33.286 --> 23:34.955
I'm actually not afraid of dying.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.707
I picture us on this tropical beach,

23:37.791 --> 23:40.627
holding hands, watching the sunset.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.506
That's my version of heaven. [chuckles]

23:47.092 --> 23:48.969
That sounds absolutely beautiful.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.722
But I am really worried
about Tara and Chloe.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.100
Well, you know
we will all take care of them.

23:55.183 --> 23:59.062
There's no way Tara can afford
to keep up the farm after I'm gone.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.940
We're barely afloat
with Buck's Social Security.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.695
Lilly, I know how hard
this must be for you.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.240
I want you to know
I'll do anything that I can.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.285
Oh, thank you.
You've already done so much.

24:13.368 --> 24:16.621
I don't know how to begin to thank you
for bringing Chloe back to me.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.374
Just seeing you together
is all the thanks that I need.

24:23.253 --> 24:25.130
Do you know something? [chuckles]

24:25.964 --> 24:28.175
All of my children were born here.

24:28.258 --> 24:31.011
Two of my daughters got married here.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.472
Buck is buried down there.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.849
The family cemetery down by the pond.

24:38.727 --> 24:39.811
So much love.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.440
I just can't imagine Chloe
growing up anywhere else.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.370
-How's it going?
-It's been a little slow.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.247
Oh,

24:59.331 --> 25:01.458
I meant with you. [chuckles]

25:01.541 --> 25:03.126
How are things at the B&B?

25:03.210 --> 25:05.837
Oh, um, it's fine.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.088
That's good news.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.965
-Not really.
-What's wrong?

25:09.049 --> 25:12.052
-I like Jo Ellen and all--
-Oh, she's a talker, isn't she?

25:12.135 --> 25:14.721
She's been super nice,
but she literally never stops.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.556
I asked about the internet being down,

25:16.640 --> 25:20.477
and she gave me a 45-minute explanation
without explaining anything.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.688
Sounds about right.
Is there anything I could do to help?

25:24.356 --> 25:28.860
Well, would it be cool if I came by
the house later to use your Wi-Fi?

25:28.944 --> 25:30.445
Why, sure!

25:30.529 --> 25:32.489
And bring your appetite with you.

25:32.572 --> 25:34.991
I've got a homemade mac and cheese
in the Crock-Pot.

25:35.075 --> 25:39.204
-Mm. That literally sounds like heaven.
-Oh, I'm glad you said that.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.374
And if you ever want your old room back,
it's there waiting for you.

25:42.457 --> 25:43.750
No questions asked.

25:43.833 --> 25:44.834
So I can come home?

25:44.918 --> 25:46.127
Of course you can.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.462
That'd be awesome.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.048
-Thanks, Aunt Connie.
-[Connie chuckles]

25:50.131 --> 25:51.299
[Connie] Aw.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.926
But what about Ricky?

25:53.009 --> 25:55.095
What if I still wanna see him?

25:55.178 --> 25:57.138
Not in the house when I'm not there.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.266
Okay, deal.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.309
-I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

26:05.564 --> 26:09.067
-I am writing a prescription for Ramipril.
-I don't need it.

26:09.150 --> 26:12.571
Charlie, anything higher
than 140 over 90 needs treatment.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.323
-And I'm--
-150 over 90.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.325
-Well, it's not too far off.
-Yeah.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.286
If you're aiming for a stroke.

26:19.369 --> 26:20.287
[scoffs]

26:20.829 --> 26:22.163
-Here.
-Thanks, Doc.

26:22.247 --> 26:23.707
I'll see you next week.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.085
[sighs]

26:27.919 --> 26:30.255
[groans]

26:31.006 --> 26:32.007
Hi.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.049
Hello there.

26:33.633 --> 26:36.261
-Oh, what is this?
-Dinner.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.473
Roast pork with a side salad
and homemade vinaigrette.

26:40.557 --> 26:43.310
All you have to do
is put it in the oven at 350

26:43.393 --> 26:44.936
for about 15 minutes.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.521
You are spoiling me.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.606
[chuckles]

26:47.689 --> 26:50.567
Well, I happen to enjoy
having someone to cook for.

26:50.650 --> 26:51.610
[Doc] Well…

26:51.693 --> 26:53.903
Thank you. Thank you very much.

26:53.987 --> 26:58.450
If you don't mind me saying,
you, um, look a little bothered.

26:58.533 --> 27:01.578
Oh, it's just a work thing.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.623
Would you like to talk about it?
I'm a good listener.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.499
You don't wanna hear about work.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.667
Sure I do!

27:07.751 --> 27:09.336
Well, let's just say

27:09.419 --> 27:13.006
I didn't handle a situation with Mel
like I would have liked to,

27:13.089 --> 27:14.424
and she is upset with me.

27:14.507 --> 27:18.470
-Well, you could always apologize.
-But here's the thing.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.722
I should have been more diplomatic, yes.

27:20.805 --> 27:24.184
-But I didn't do anything wrong.
-Why would you think that?

27:24.267 --> 27:28.938
As a kid, I was taught,
"Handle your problems by yourself."

27:29.022 --> 27:32.525
And now Mel wants me
to run every work decision by her.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.028
[scoffs] That's just--
It's not how I operate.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.781
Yeah, but, you see,
if you open up to someone else,

27:37.864 --> 27:41.368
then it could help you see the problem
from a whole new perspective.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.994
That's never been my way.

27:43.078 --> 27:47.707
And this old dog
is way past learning new tricks.

27:47.791 --> 27:51.211
Saying you are too old to change
is just an excuse.

27:51.294 --> 27:52.337
[chuckles]

27:52.420 --> 27:57.300
The aging brain actually is far superior
in emotional intelligence

27:57.384 --> 27:59.177
than our younger counterparts.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.763
And your findings are based on--

28:01.846 --> 28:03.932
A few minutes I've spent on TikTok.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.017
[laughs]

28:06.101 --> 28:07.394
Enjoy your dinner.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.354
Thank you.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.067
[quietly] Thank you.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.949
I have that extra order
of apple pies for you.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.502
Thanks.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.004
Anything else?

28:35.797 --> 28:37.090
Uh,

28:37.173 --> 28:41.261
look, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.

28:41.344 --> 28:44.013
I was just trying
to be considerate of your time.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.517
Well, you did hurt my feelings,

28:47.600 --> 28:50.311
but I respect your intention.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.606
So, you forgive me?

28:54.274 --> 28:55.942
Hm, I suppose so.

28:56.025 --> 28:56.901
[chuckles]

28:56.985 --> 28:59.195
Did you talk to the camp director
about the play?

28:59.279 --> 29:03.199
Oh, yeah. Long enough for her to talk me
into filling in for the director.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.409
-You?
-Mm-hmm.

29:04.492 --> 29:07.871
-Apparently, no one else wants the job.
-That's mighty brave of you.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.247
Yeah, or stupid.

29:09.330 --> 29:10.248
Oh! [chuckles]

29:10.331 --> 29:12.876
I don't know what I'm doing,
and neither do the kids.

29:12.959 --> 29:15.754
-Well, talk to Muriel.
-She has experience with musicals?

29:15.837 --> 29:17.589
I'm surprised you didn't know that.

29:17.672 --> 29:20.759
She loves to wax poetic
about her former acting career.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.136
Thanks. I'll call her.

29:24.262 --> 29:28.600
Oh, um, by the way, you're still welcome
to come over and hang out.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.144
And if I wanna do the laundry?

29:31.978 --> 29:33.396
We could work something out.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.815
[chuckles]

29:42.363 --> 29:43.364
Brie!

29:44.115 --> 29:46.743
Hey! Whoa, hey! Brie, wait up!

29:46.826 --> 29:47.744
Hey!

29:48.995 --> 29:50.747
-I've been trying to call you.
-Really?

29:50.830 --> 29:54.209
I waited three hours for you to come back
without a phone call or text.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.293
My phone died.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.962
And no one at work
had a phone you could've used?

29:58.546 --> 30:01.758
I swear to God,
I wasn't trying to leave you hanging.

30:03.551 --> 30:04.844
Yeah, well, you did.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.265
I'm really sorry.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.811
Come on. There's gotta be something
I can do to make it right.

30:13.686 --> 30:14.938
No, there's nothing.

30:15.021 --> 30:15.980
You sure?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.274
What about this?

30:18.358 --> 30:20.902
Oh, no, that is not gonna happen.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.738
All right. If that's how you want it.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.618
I know what you're trying to do.
It's not gonna work.

30:29.369 --> 30:33.122
All I'm doing
is admiring how beautiful you are.

30:34.457 --> 30:35.792
Nice try.

30:37.460 --> 30:38.378
Listen,

30:39.546 --> 30:44.926
I am very, very sorry for making you wait,

30:45.760 --> 30:47.262
and I promise

30:47.929 --> 30:49.848
I will make it up to you.

30:54.894 --> 30:55.895
Damn you.

30:55.979 --> 30:57.397
Yes.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.320
[latch clicks]

31:08.157 --> 31:09.200
Brie?

31:12.245 --> 31:13.913
[Jack] Hey, what are you doing here?

31:15.665 --> 31:16.916
Get away from my sister.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.126
Jack, calm down.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.211
Hey. Hey! We are seeing each other.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.046
-You shot me.
-[Brady] That's not true.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.465
-What are you talking about?
-You were there.

31:25.633 --> 31:29.262
Yes, I was there, but I did not shoot you.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.140
-You--
-Jack! Jack!

31:32.223 --> 31:33.182
Jack.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.769
Get the hell off my property.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.064
-Brie.
-No, I think you better go.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.693
Get off my property!

31:52.201 --> 31:54.162
[motorbike revs]

32:11.304 --> 32:12.805
[knocking at door]

32:14.891 --> 32:15.725
Doc.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.519
You got a corkscrew?

32:21.189 --> 32:22.523
Uh, yeah.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.445
[Mel] I had no idea. I'm so sorry.

32:27.528 --> 32:30.490
[Doc] It's not on you.
I didn't want anyone to know.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.075
What's the prognosis?

32:32.158 --> 32:33.785
Well, uh,

32:33.868 --> 32:36.537
I've lost about 15% of my vision,

32:36.621 --> 32:38.456
but I can function pretty well.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.541
Long-term… [sighs]

32:40.625 --> 32:43.795
Um, probably facing somewhere between, um,

32:44.379 --> 32:48.466
partial and, uh, complete loss of sight.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.219
You're going blind?

32:51.302 --> 32:53.471
In a word, maybe.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.685
That's why you were looking
for a replacement.

32:58.768 --> 32:59.727
Correct.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.523
And I told you that my search
had nothing to do with you.

33:03.606 --> 33:05.149
I know. I'm sorry.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.237
I am the one who needs to apologize. I…

33:10.279 --> 33:12.865
I took my frustrations out on you,

33:12.949 --> 33:15.076
and that wasn't right, and I…

33:15.618 --> 33:17.787
I hope you will forgive me.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.915
Of course I forgive you. [sniffles]

33:20.999 --> 33:23.167
-We don't need any tears.
-[cries] No.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.086
-We're good now, right?
-Yes, we're good.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.629
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-[Mel sniffles]

33:26.713 --> 33:28.756
That was great. [cries]

33:29.424 --> 33:31.300
There's one thing I need from you.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.301
Okay.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.638
Promise me you won't tell anyone,

33:36.264 --> 33:37.348
not even Jack.

33:37.432 --> 33:41.019
Because I wanna know
who my successor is before I go public.

33:41.644 --> 33:43.479
Okay. Yeah.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.690
-[sniffles]
-[Doc] You're sure?

33:45.773 --> 33:47.525
No one means no one.

33:47.608 --> 33:52.030
Yes. I am perfectly capable
of maintaining confidentiality.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.741
Well, then we shouldn't have any issues.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.910
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure we'll find
something to disagree on.

33:57.994 --> 34:00.747
Which is exactly how I want it to be.

34:00.830 --> 34:01.831
Normal.

34:04.959 --> 34:06.335
-Hey.
-[Mel sniffles]

34:07.253 --> 34:08.254
Thanks.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.424
To

34:12.842 --> 34:13.843
seeing clearly.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.970
Cheers to that.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.138
[Mel chuckles softly]

34:23.102 --> 34:25.980
Hey, there's some lady here to see you.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.273
Okay, who is she?

34:27.356 --> 34:28.483
She didn't say.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.485
I'm Valerie Holt.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.904
Oh, the attorney. Right.

34:32.987 --> 34:36.949
Uh, yeah. Jack Sheridan.
Your email said you were gonna call.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.578
I happened to be in the area.
I thought I'd stop by. You have a minute?

34:40.661 --> 34:43.122
Uh, sure, yeah. Uh, sorry.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.957
Excuse the mess. Have a seat.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.669
[cell phone ringing]

34:48.753 --> 34:50.713
-[ringing stops]
-Sorry.

34:50.797 --> 34:55.134
So, your email had a lot of info.
I thought I could clarify a few things.

34:55.218 --> 34:57.637
Yeah, I think my main priority is

34:57.720 --> 35:00.932
just to ensure that I have an active role
in my children's lives.

35:01.015 --> 35:03.267
Has Charmaine threatened
to withhold access?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.020
Well, not directly,

35:06.104 --> 35:09.982
but her fiancé
did offer to adopt the twins.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.359
How did you respond to that?

35:11.442 --> 35:14.237
He's out of his mind if he thought
I'd give up my children.

35:14.320 --> 35:15.905
That's why I reached out to you.

35:15.988 --> 35:19.992
I get a feeling about a custody issue
because Charmaine and I are not married.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.495
If she doesn't agree
to put your name on the birth certificate

35:22.578 --> 35:25.540
or sign a declaration
acknowledging you're the father,

35:25.623 --> 35:28.000
then you would have to file
a petition of paternity.

35:29.001 --> 35:32.630
-So I'll have to prove that in court?
-Yes. It's not a simple process.

35:32.713 --> 35:35.591
If Charmaine decides
that she wants to ask for full custody,

35:35.675 --> 35:38.136
then you could be fighting
for years in court.

35:38.719 --> 35:39.762
[scoffs]

35:39.846 --> 35:40.805
[quietly] Right.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.808
And I presume that that whole time,

35:43.891 --> 35:46.060
the twins are gonna be
living with her and Todd.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.145
Exactly.

35:47.645 --> 35:51.315
Okay, so if I wanna hire you,
how would that work?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.192
My hourly rate is 350.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.237
-[Valerie] I take a $25,000 retainer.
-[scoffs] Right.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.489
Since you're Brie's brother, I'll take 20.

36:00.199 --> 36:01.868
That something you can do?

36:03.244 --> 36:05.288
No, but I will figure that out.

36:06.622 --> 36:09.542
If I have to fight to be in
my children's lives, I'm gonna fight.

36:09.625 --> 36:14.338
It will be a fight, and custody cases
are emotionally and financially draining.

36:14.422 --> 36:16.883
They're always a huge disruption
to people's lives.

36:16.966 --> 36:17.967
[sighs]

36:21.012 --> 36:24.724
Your twins are lucky to have a father
willing to sacrifice so much for them.

36:24.807 --> 36:26.184
[Valerie] I'll be in touch.

36:27.059 --> 36:27.977
Thank you.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.957
[lock clicks]

36:52.793 --> 36:54.962
Hey, I tried calling you.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.006
Hey. I just, um,

36:57.673 --> 36:59.508
got caught up at the bar.

36:59.592 --> 37:00.676
Don't worry about it.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.763
[Mel] Where's the food?

37:06.224 --> 37:07.725
[groans quietly] Sorry, I…

37:09.644 --> 37:10.853
forgot that was the plan.

37:11.520 --> 37:14.273
It's fine. I can figure something out.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.110
[bottle clinks]

37:21.405 --> 37:22.406
[Mel] Are you okay?

37:23.783 --> 37:26.077
Yeah, just a long day.

37:26.869 --> 37:30.498
[Mel] Well, I was gonna surprise you,
but I have no patience.

37:30.581 --> 37:31.582
[chuckles] So,

37:33.125 --> 37:34.961
I got us tickets to Maui.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.755
Joey said we could use her timeshare.

37:38.756 --> 37:39.882
You booked tickets?

37:39.966 --> 37:42.260
Yeah, for Christmas.

37:42.343 --> 37:43.928
I should've asked you first,

37:44.011 --> 37:48.057
but I just wanted to do
something spontaneous for a change, and…

37:50.851 --> 37:53.312
[nervously] …I thought
it would be romantic.

37:55.481 --> 37:56.482
What's wrong?

37:58.526 --> 37:59.819
Mel, I, um…

38:02.071 --> 38:07.368
I met with an attorney today
about custody of the twins.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.037
Oh. [sighs]

38:10.121 --> 38:12.331
-[Mel] How did that go?
-Not great.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.584
If I wanna be in their lives,

38:15.668 --> 38:18.087
I'm facing
a long and expensive court battle.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.131
[quietly] Oh.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.590
I'm so sorry.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.845
[Mel] You know that I support you
whatever you need to do.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.348
I know, um…

38:30.182 --> 38:31.350
It's just…

38:34.645 --> 38:36.564
Uh, I feel like…

38:37.815 --> 38:39.400
[groans]

38:39.900 --> 38:42.361
…you're gonna get
the short end of the stick.

38:42.445 --> 38:45.531
I don't understand what that means.
Are you talking about money?

38:45.614 --> 38:48.868
-I don't care about money.
-No, it's not just money.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.202
It's time too.

38:50.786 --> 38:52.872
Mel, for the next year, at least,

38:52.955 --> 38:55.082
I'm gonna be juggling being a new father,

38:55.166 --> 38:56.584
fighting for custody,

38:56.667 --> 38:59.128
rebuilding my house, running the bar.

38:59.211 --> 39:00.087
[softly] Yeah.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.633
I don't think I can have another baby
on top of all that.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.476
[Jack] I'm sorry.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.316
You know what?

39:22.485 --> 39:23.486
It's okay.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.239
We can wait until you're ready.

39:27.823 --> 39:28.699
Okay?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.827
[emotional music playing]

39:31.911 --> 39:36.832
And what if we wait, and then I realize
I can't handle supporting two families?

39:39.335 --> 39:42.630
You would've wasted all that time.
That's time you can't get back.

39:42.713 --> 39:47.593
Mel, I can't be the person that stands
in the way of you becoming a mother.

39:50.346 --> 39:51.972
I just can't hurt you like that.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.100
Well, look,

39:55.559 --> 39:58.521
as long as I know how you feel about it,
then it's my choice.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.064
-No, that's just it.
-Jack--

40:00.147 --> 40:02.775
No, Mel, you shouldn't have to choose.

40:03.984 --> 40:07.655
You deserve to be with someone
that can give you everything you want.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.323
[Jack] I don't think that's me.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.620
Are you saying that you wanna end this?

40:14.703 --> 40:16.580
It's not because I want to.

40:17.915 --> 40:18.958
Oh my God.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.670
I can't believe this is happening now.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.588
Mel, you're an amazing woman.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.882
Jack, you're not listening to what I want.

40:26.966 --> 40:29.385
I am listening.
That's what I'm trying to say.

40:29.468 --> 40:32.430
I know what you want.
I don't know if I can give it to you.

40:35.891 --> 40:37.351
[Jack] This is killing me…

40:42.898 --> 40:44.775
but I know I'm doing the right thing.
