04:16.624 --> 04:17.755
Do you see Vint?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.291
Yeah I see.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.894
See the shirt I got for him?

04:21.896 --> 04:23.062
Yeah.

04:23.064 --> 04:24.263
We're gonna be dressed
up for you today.

04:24.265 --> 04:27.233
It's a nice
shirt, not my taste.

04:27.235 --> 04:29.301
Your father wouldn't be caught
dead in a shirt like that.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.471
Alright mom.

04:31.906 --> 04:33.639
How long are you going
to keep up this charade?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.774
Please we all know
why you married him.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.875
Can we not do this today...

04:36.877 --> 04:38.110
It's not working out is it?

04:38.112 --> 04:41.047
Do have any good
news to talk about?

04:41.049 --> 04:43.315
Yeah, when are you getting
rid of him, that would be...

04:43.317 --> 04:45.384
Can we please talk
about something else?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.220
Fine.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.112
You know you need to
brush after you do that,

05:13.114 --> 05:17.285
you'll get cavities, I mean
your teeth will rot out.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.120
Yeah I wrestled in high
school had to make weight,

05:21.122 --> 05:23.555
I got four cavities
doing that shit,

05:23.557 --> 05:24.856
I also passed out
a couple of times,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.658
it's just not a good idea.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.660
What do you want?

05:28.662 --> 05:32.898
Nothing, I just come out
here to smoke a cigarette.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.001
Your parents smoke
you didn't have to

05:35.003 --> 05:37.569
come out here for that.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.038
Yeah, I know.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.741
I'm just not ready to
listen to their comments.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.745
So how's married life?

05:52.386 --> 05:55.087
Good god, you're like 16,

05:55.089 --> 05:57.089
you're too young to
be doing that shit.

05:57.091 --> 05:58.524
Oh so now you're interested.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.693
You know what,

06:02.096 --> 06:03.762
I think I going
to blackmail you,

06:03.764 --> 06:05.831
give me five bucks to get
a pack of cigarettes and I

06:05.833 --> 06:10.004
won't tell Kay about you little
death machine over there.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.279
You know what I do
to people who don't

06:20.281 --> 06:22.281
pay be back my money.

06:22.283 --> 06:23.451
Rotate, smack.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.417
What are you looking for?

07:31.419 --> 07:33.919
The lake, I don't want
to park too far away.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.156
Jesus Christ,

07:37.558 --> 07:38.524
The bathroom's over there,

07:38.526 --> 07:40.426
so just park somewhere please.

07:40.428 --> 07:41.927
Okay.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.363
You don't want to park too
far, we're going on a hike.

07:44.365 --> 07:46.198
I just don't want, what?

07:46.200 --> 07:47.399
I don't wanna...

07:47.401 --> 07:50.070
Have-you ever been on a hike?

07:51.239 --> 07:54.742
Yeah, here, hold on,
I'll walk with you.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.714
Can we try to have
a good time at least?

08:02.716 --> 08:03.815
At least try?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.284
Yeah, this is gonna be great.

08:05.286 --> 08:09.721
I mean go check in, I'll find
the bathroom, and just try.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.392
How are you doing?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.226
Oh you got that what now,

08:14.228 --> 08:17.028
what now look on your face.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.664
Listen, so we don't
get into trouble,

08:18.666 --> 08:21.099
could you move your
car to another slot,

08:21.101 --> 08:23.235
I'm going to have a hell
of a time backing out

08:23.237 --> 08:25.003
of here in the morning.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.338
Oh, yeah, that's
not a problem.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.073
Let me move it.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.076
Thank you.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.712
where are you all from?

08:33.714 --> 08:34.645
East coast.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.182
I could tell.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.883
How could you tell?

08:37.885 --> 08:38.884
Well you don't
look like they're

08:38.885 --> 08:40.952
gonna sell you by the pound.

08:42.823 --> 08:43.655
You're pretty
funny aren't you?

08:43.657 --> 08:44.523
Are you here all week?

08:44.525 --> 08:45.757
Yes I am.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.425
IS that what this
whole thing is about?

08:46.427 --> 08:47.060
Yes mam.

08:48.396 --> 08:51.299
Oh the things that
happen out here.

08:52.233 --> 08:53.365
It's pretty.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.502
Yeah, it's beautiful.

08:56.504 --> 08:57.338
Yep.

08:58.539 --> 08:59.873
OK here we go.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.195
Today wasn't so bad was it?

09:23.197 --> 09:25.163
Rene looked good.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.098
Is she still seeing a shrink?

09:27.100 --> 09:29.034
What are you talking about?

09:29.036 --> 09:31.870
Looked like a mess still.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.405
I think she has her
insurance cover it.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.640
Why the fuck?

09:34.642 --> 09:35.441
Why would you ask if
she's seeing a shrink?

09:35.443 --> 09:37.075
Why would you care?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.078
No reason.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.314
Yeah put down over there.

10:15.316 --> 10:16.782
You there honey?

10:16.784 --> 10:18.149
Hello?

10:18.151 --> 10:18.984
Hello?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.452
Who is this?

10:20.454 --> 10:22.856
Don't you worry about that.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.796
Tell me now.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.731
It doesn't matter
and you know it.

11:19.713 --> 11:22.414
Hey, what are you doing?

11:22.416 --> 11:25.353
We got a long drive
back, let's go.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.643
How can we help
you, are you alright?

11:51.645 --> 11:54.546
I think I need to
go to a hospital.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.814
Okay, we'll take
you, we'll take you,

11:55.816 --> 11:56.817
can you sit?

12:08.862 --> 12:10.596
Almost there.

12:10.598 --> 12:14.099
Watch the rocks Vint,
you're gonna hurt him.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.334
I promise this is it.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.771
Come on get him in
and be easy with him.

12:19.773 --> 12:20.972
Can you sit?

12:20.974 --> 12:23.711
Easy you don't
treat him like that.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.116
We're looking for
a hospital Vint.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.117
Go to the right Vint.

12:32.119 --> 12:32.951
What?

12:32.953 --> 12:34.455
Go to the right.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.961
Go faster, please
go faster Vint!

12:42.630 --> 12:43.964
Go to the right!

12:44.932 --> 12:46.333
Just go straight.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.334
Go faster!

12:49.336 --> 12:50.438
I'm trying!

16:14.074 --> 16:15.408
Hey, hey, hey!

16:19.212 --> 16:20.047
Hey, hey!

19:41.048 --> 19:43.216
You gonna say something?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.187
I just don't know what to say.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.622
What's going on?

19:50.958 --> 19:54.461
Somebody attacked
you and Kay's missing.

19:57.164 --> 19:57.998
What?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.034
Kay?

20:01.969 --> 20:03.736
Kay, your wife Kay.

20:05.873 --> 20:07.505
You've been in a coma
for three months,

20:07.507 --> 20:09.442
and the police told us,

20:10.577 --> 20:12.878
that usually after
one week they have to

20:12.880 --> 20:15.346
presume that she's dead.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.283
Bullshit,

20:17.550 --> 20:18.385
bullshit.

20:23.090 --> 20:25.492
You do know who I am right?

20:33.200 --> 20:36.834
I just want
this to be over with.

20:36.836 --> 20:37.670
I know.

22:06.093 --> 22:07.458
Hey.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.295
Hey.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.097
I've been staying
upstairs since you've

22:12.099 --> 22:14.099
been in the hospital.

22:14.101 --> 22:18.271
That's alright, I've been
busy trying not to die.

22:22.842 --> 22:26.111
Won't ask you how you're
feeling but you look like hell.

22:26.113 --> 22:30.283
Oh thanks, it's probably
just my hair, I just woke up.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.221
Well I'm gonna go.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.888
You got some kind of agenda.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.525
No I mean I'm going
upstairs to get my stuff.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.629
You really gonna
set me up like this.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.431
Let me guess,

22:46.433 --> 22:50.435
you don't have anywhere to do
except your parent's house?

22:50.437 --> 22:53.804
I'm not sure that's
an option any more.

22:53.806 --> 22:57.977
You can stay upstairs, I
can't make it up there anyway.

23:00.647 --> 23:01.881
Okay, thanks.

24:25.532 --> 24:26.364
Oh my god,

24:26.366 --> 24:27.832
Vint, Vint,

24:27.834 --> 24:29.100
come here, come here,

24:29.102 --> 24:31.936
Vint, Jesus Christ,
what the hell.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.604
Come here, get up, get up.

24:33.606 --> 24:34.439
Oh my god,

24:34.441 --> 24:35.273
get up Vint,

24:35.275 --> 24:36.207
get up,

24:36.209 --> 24:37.142
what the hell did you do,

24:37.144 --> 24:38.809
what did you do.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.380
Come on talk, talk.

24:41.214 --> 24:42.046
God,

24:42.048 --> 24:42.880
what did you do?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.217
What did you do?

24:45.252 --> 24:46.083
How many did you take?

24:46.085 --> 24:47.585
Hey.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.520
Just let this happen.

24:49.522 --> 24:50.588
Just let what happen?

24:50.590 --> 24:52.659
Just let things happen.

24:56.929 --> 24:57.764
Look,

24:59.699 --> 25:00.467
if I die,

25:02.001 --> 25:02.935
then I die.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.740
If I live until tomorrow,

25:09.075 --> 25:11.644
then I'm still worth something.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.314
Okay?

25:18.151 --> 25:18.985
Go.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.527
I'll call you if
I need anything.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.460
What do you
think you're doing?

28:14.327 --> 28:16.396
I'm gonna kick his ass.

28:17.397 --> 28:18.230
Sure.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.572
You don't remember me?

29:00.873 --> 29:02.373
No.

29:02.375 --> 29:04.442
I take no disrespect,

29:04.444 --> 29:07.614
I can't remember
much any more either.

29:16.656 --> 29:18.925
Heard what happened to you.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.994
Yeah, but now you're back.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.331
Congratulations.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.135
Here, here's your prize.

29:31.404 --> 29:32.238
Take it.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.342
So who told?

29:38.344 --> 29:41.013
A woman, on a phone out front.

29:43.349 --> 29:47.952
I heard it while I was
listening to the Stones,

29:47.954 --> 29:48.853
right out front,

29:48.855 --> 29:50.757
the girl at your house,

29:52.559 --> 29:55.225
talking loud as hell at 2am,

29:55.227 --> 29:56.594
I almost had to say
something to her

29:56.596 --> 30:00.064
because I was trying
to get some sleep.

30:00.066 --> 30:00.998
I hate people like that

30:01.000 --> 30:03.300
I hate, people like that.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.303
Just stupid.

30:06.539 --> 30:07.805
That's alright, that's alright,

30:07.807 --> 30:09.709
I'm a forgiving person.

30:13.279 --> 30:16.549
So you really don't
remember me at all?

30:18.150 --> 30:18.983
No.

30:22.555 --> 30:24.955
you probably should you know.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.694
Why don't you take
a hit of that?

30:28.628 --> 30:29.562
Wait, wait.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.363
Better not.

30:32.999 --> 30:37.001
I mean it might put
you back into a coma.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.338
That would suck wouldn't it.

30:41.207 --> 30:44.842
Probably should, we barely
spoke to each other, so.

30:44.844 --> 30:46.143
In fact, last time,

30:46.145 --> 30:49.680
last time I saw you is
when I invited you to

30:49.682 --> 30:51.183
my birthday party.

30:53.486 --> 30:54.318
Did I go?

30:54.320 --> 30:56.055
No, you did not go.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.160
I envy you.

31:03.796 --> 31:07.131
You cannot remember
your past ills.

31:07.133 --> 31:07.967
You,

31:09.435 --> 31:10.601
shouldn't get upset,

31:10.603 --> 31:13.337
you know if your memory
never comes back,

31:13.339 --> 31:15.573
you get a do over man,

31:15.575 --> 31:18.077
create something for yourself.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.148
Son of a bitch.

31:23.850 --> 31:24.684
Do over.

31:29.789 --> 31:32.191
I used to love to go to work.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.161
Now I can't.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.530
Hey, you need a place to crash?

31:39.532 --> 31:40.466
I got room.

31:41.568 --> 31:42.401
Thanks.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.845
What the hell's that?

31:53.880 --> 31:56.215
That's me, and that's you.

31:57.349 --> 31:58.785
I'm stabbing you.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.119
With skis on?

32:02.121 --> 32:03.389
With skis on.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.125
Okay.

33:49.696 --> 33:52.763
It's amazing how important
someone becomes after they die.

33:52.765 --> 33:54.767
In my case, almost dies.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.068
You feeling okay?

33:58.070 --> 33:59.471
Fantastic, why?

34:01.640 --> 34:03.640
Just thought I might
make up this morning and

34:03.642 --> 34:05.575
find you dead downstairs.

34:05.577 --> 34:06.510
Oh, thanks a lot,

34:06.512 --> 34:08.478
no, I'm not dead downstairs,

34:08.480 --> 34:10.715
well, I'm dead downstairs,

34:10.717 --> 34:14.217
but I'm not lying
on the floor dead.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.418
You know I'm starting
to wonder how

34:15.420 --> 34:18.022
you're able to spend
your time here.

34:18.024 --> 34:20.056
You're not here on
my account are you?

34:20.059 --> 34:22.561
No it's not on your account.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.996
I'm kinda between
jobs right now,

34:25.998 --> 34:30.168
and trying to get out of my
parent's house anyway, so.

34:35.507 --> 34:36.741
What?

34:36.743 --> 34:37.576
What?

34:42.481 --> 34:45.014
Oh yeah, your mom called.

34:45.016 --> 34:48.955
Physical therapist will
be here in the morning.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.174
Careful with that man.

35:43.709 --> 35:47.611
Father gave me that
for my 14th birthday.

35:47.613 --> 35:50.282
I'm just yanking your chain man.

35:54.320 --> 35:57.788
Piece of shit, just like he was.

35:57.790 --> 36:00.024
Come to think of it.

36:00.026 --> 36:02.126
DO what you want with it.

36:02.128 --> 36:05.362
Keep it, sell it, throw
it away, I don't care.

36:05.364 --> 36:06.196
But it's old.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.697
The thing's old.

36:07.699 --> 36:10.667
You gotta pull back on the
hammer hard, real hard.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.237
Yeah, Kay's
family sold my .45,

36:13.239 --> 36:16.075
along with about
everything I own.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.410
Fuck'em.

36:19.912 --> 36:22.212
The man who dies
with the most toys,

36:22.214 --> 36:23.149
still dies.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.019
Doesn't mean shit.

36:29.088 --> 36:29.922
Christ.

36:31.057 --> 36:34.026
Sit down and relax,
take a load off.

36:39.698 --> 36:43.269
You are the walking
dead, just like myself.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.535
Yeah,

36:45.537 --> 36:46.770
there's a world
that doesn't seem to

36:46.772 --> 36:49.139
want us around much longer,

36:49.141 --> 36:50.707
so fuck it, might as
well make the most of

36:50.709 --> 36:52.977
what we got left right?

36:52.979 --> 36:54.046
See that gun,

36:55.181 --> 36:57.181
that gun there is priceless,

36:57.183 --> 36:58.517
as in price less

37:00.419 --> 37:03.187
I mean, it means nothing to me,

37:03.189 --> 37:04.021
no,

37:04.023 --> 37:05.689
it's nothing to me,

37:05.691 --> 37:06.924
it was given to
me by an asshole,

37:06.926 --> 37:10.729
it's gonna be given to
you by another asshole.

37:11.597 --> 37:13.363
Yeah, you need a gun don't you,

37:13.365 --> 37:14.698
what you got going on huh?

37:14.700 --> 37:16.700
Got your own little battle,

37:16.702 --> 37:19.103
your own little personal war?

37:19.105 --> 37:19.939
Both.

37:21.073 --> 37:25.275
Well then what's your
objective my friend?

37:25.277 --> 37:28.514
I don't know, I'm
letting it find me.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.316
Yeah, tell you what,

37:32.318 --> 37:35.421
come on I'm gonna
show you something.

37:41.127 --> 37:42.859
Hush, hey, hey, hey,

37:42.861 --> 37:45.631
relax, I aint
gonna hurt you man.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.335
I didn't think they made
scars that ugly any more,

37:51.337 --> 37:54.838
that is one mother
fucking ugly scar.

37:54.840 --> 37:56.073
It's also one clear cut,

37:56.075 --> 37:59.178
no doubt about it
motive right there,

38:01.547 --> 38:03.382
you know what I think?

38:04.583 --> 38:06.585
I think if you suffered,

38:07.619 --> 38:09.586
if you've experienced
loss you're

38:09.588 --> 38:11.621
more open to understanding,

38:11.623 --> 38:15.825
but you're more hoping to do
something about it, am I right?

38:15.827 --> 38:16.662
Maybe.

38:20.166 --> 38:22.935
I can't hardly
remember anything.

38:25.071 --> 38:27.771
I don't even know
what I'm walking into.

38:27.773 --> 38:30.640
Well you must
remember something,

38:30.642 --> 38:34.813
because you broke into my
house to steal one of my guns.

38:36.115 --> 38:38.348
Hey, come up here.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.851
Told you it's old.

38:41.087 --> 38:42.321
Son of a bitch.

38:43.956 --> 38:45.555
It's loaded,

38:45.557 --> 38:46.792
it's all yours.

38:47.994 --> 38:49.193
Really?

38:49.195 --> 38:50.594
Yeah, I got four
more like it upstairs.

38:50.596 --> 38:51.996
So uh,

38:51.998 --> 38:55.432
oh you won't need license
with that one, no,

38:55.434 --> 38:57.567
but make sure you don't
point it at your dog,

38:57.569 --> 38:58.969
or your feet,

38:58.971 --> 39:01.673
because it will
get the job done.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.444
All I gotta say is,

39:08.380 --> 39:12.216
that demon that you're
ready to stomp on,

39:12.218 --> 39:15.019
just make sure you kill it,

39:15.021 --> 39:16.686
alright,

39:16.688 --> 39:17.887
because I didn't
kill mine and it

39:17.889 --> 39:20.624
comes back to haunt
me every night.

39:20.626 --> 39:21.958
Thought maybe I woke you up.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.062
Yeah, yeah.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.697
I was deep sleep I was
dreaming about this moment,

39:27.699 --> 39:28.634
right here.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.503
Right here.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.108
Stop, stop.

40:44.110 --> 40:44.941
No, stop.

40:44.943 --> 40:45.775
Give it to me,

40:45.777 --> 40:46.743
What?

40:46.745 --> 40:47.711
Stop, what are you doing?

40:47.713 --> 40:49.779
Give it to me, give it to me.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.115
What are you doing down here?

40:51.117 --> 40:52.782
I was looking for you.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.351
And doing your laundry?

40:54.353 --> 40:56.220
Yeah, so I was doing my
laundry, so fucking what?

40:56.222 --> 40:57.354
What are you doing down here,

40:57.356 --> 40:59.389
and what are you
doing with this?

40:59.391 --> 41:00.857
I was about to put these
in a trunk of my car and

41:00.859 --> 41:02.392
go on a little trip until
you wrestled it away from me,

41:02.394 --> 41:03.527
but that's cool,

41:03.529 --> 41:04.928
if that's your
style, I forgive you.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.396
And when were you
planing on going,

41:06.398 --> 41:07.997
you haven't even had
time to do research,

41:07.999 --> 41:09.433
you're just being
fucking stupid.

41:09.435 --> 41:11.335
Hey until you experience
a tenth of what I've

41:11.337 --> 41:13.137
gone through in the
last three months,

41:13.139 --> 41:14.304
then I'll listen to
what you have to say,

41:14.306 --> 41:16.005
but until then I don't care.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.107
Are you serious?

41:17.109 --> 41:18.708
I fucking lost my sister,

41:18.710 --> 41:20.076
I don't know where
the fuck she is.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.478
Hey I'm not perfect,

41:21.480 --> 41:22.946
you're not perfect.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.981
Yeah maybe I'm jumping
into this fast.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.651
If I don't fucking go out
there and deal with it now,

41:27.653 --> 41:29.953
I will kill myself.

41:29.955 --> 41:30.787
Give me this.

41:30.789 --> 41:31.621
NO.

41:31.623 --> 41:32.456
Mia.

41:32.458 --> 41:33.292
No.

41:35.261 --> 41:36.493
Come back.

41:36.495 --> 41:38.864
Mia, stop, what
the fuck, stop.

41:40.199 --> 41:41.398
What the fuck?

41:41.400 --> 41:42.234
Stop!

42:22.374 --> 42:23.840
Where are you going?

42:23.842 --> 42:24.676
Vint?

42:33.619 --> 42:34.453
Vint?

42:38.857 --> 42:40.123
Where are you going?

42:40.125 --> 42:40.926
Vint, hey.

42:43.262 --> 42:45.495
You wanted to come
on this trip with me,

42:45.497 --> 42:47.497
I need you to be
my eyes out here,

42:47.499 --> 42:50.033
okay, I'm not exactly
rolling at 100 percent.

42:50.035 --> 42:51.435
Are you serious?

42:51.437 --> 42:54.504
Just be aware of
everything you see,

42:54.506 --> 42:55.674
be like a cat.

42:58.344 --> 43:01.012
Meow.

43:36.882 --> 43:38.615
How are you guys doing?

43:38.617 --> 43:39.451
Alright.

43:41.086 --> 43:44.256
What's the best
you can do on these?

43:51.062 --> 43:53.897
That's an old Rimfire.

43:53.899 --> 43:55.732
Well if you're planing
on robbing a stage coach,

43:55.734 --> 43:56.933
that'll do just fine,

43:56.935 --> 43:59.135
but if you want to to fire,

43:59.137 --> 44:02.908
I don't know if that's
gonna do what you want.

44:05.143 --> 44:07.110
Um, do you want it,

44:07.112 --> 44:08.445
I'll give you both of
these for whatever you

44:08.447 --> 44:11.049
can give me in that glass case.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.986
I'll trade you for that .45.

44:16.154 --> 44:18.256
Yeah okay, let's do it.

44:19.425 --> 44:21.625
I'll have to run
a background check.

44:21.627 --> 44:23.259
Um, you know what,

44:23.261 --> 44:24.193
never mind,

44:24.195 --> 44:26.796
I need to run and grab a couple,

44:26.798 --> 44:29.433
I'll just bring these back.

44:29.435 --> 44:31.368
What are you in
such a hurry for?

44:31.370 --> 44:35.972
I'm not, but I can't
respectfully decline the offer?

44:35.974 --> 44:37.407
IF you ever change your mind,

44:37.409 --> 44:39.411
we're open till dark 30.

45:00.932 --> 45:03.567
So why do you think
you stayed in there?

45:03.569 --> 45:05.168
Well we must have,

45:05.170 --> 45:06.470
I mean that morning we
drove straight through to

45:06.472 --> 45:07.671
the reunion,

45:07.673 --> 45:09.439
it's only four hours
from the house.

45:09.441 --> 45:12.308
Yeah, Kay told me about that.

45:12.310 --> 45:14.143
We stayed overnight somewhere,

45:14.145 --> 45:17.213
this is the closest
in-town hotel around.

45:17.215 --> 45:18.882
I was gonna do
something illegal,

45:18.884 --> 45:21.385
wouldn't stay out of the chain.

45:21.387 --> 45:22.986
The only thing I do know
is the police tried to

45:22.988 --> 45:24.754
trace the calls and couldn't,

45:24.756 --> 45:26.756
disposable cell phone,

45:26.758 --> 45:28.291
but they were able
to tell that the

45:28.293 --> 45:32.030
number she was calling
was from here in town.

45:33.198 --> 45:36.032
Well this is a
good spot to start.

45:36.034 --> 45:37.100
Alright, I'll be right back,

45:37.102 --> 45:39.803
keep your phone on you.-

45:39.805 --> 45:41.337
- I'm coming with you.

45:41.339 --> 45:43.106
No trust me,

45:43.108 --> 45:46.177
you're gonna do more
by staying here.

45:47.546 --> 45:48.380
Alright.

46:13.405 --> 46:14.406
Hey there.

46:23.615 --> 46:25.849
Is this the only
place to stay in town?

46:25.851 --> 46:27.352
Basically, yeah.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.354
Do I look familiar to you,

46:31.356 --> 46:34.023
maybe from three months ago.

46:34.025 --> 46:36.059
How would I know who you are.

46:36.061 --> 46:38.495
Well I might have
rented a room with you,

46:38.497 --> 46:41.465
I was another woman,
early 30s, blonde hair.

46:41.467 --> 46:44.901
You don't know if you
rented a room here or not?

46:44.903 --> 46:47.837
Never mind, forget
I said anything,

46:47.839 --> 46:49.841
I'll take a room though.

46:51.209 --> 46:54.243
I need your id,
and 45 dollars cash.

46:54.245 --> 46:56.247
Don't take no cards yet.

47:03.088 --> 47:05.922
If I can give you a room,

47:05.924 --> 47:09.392
it's gonna cause
probably for both of us,

47:09.394 --> 47:12.696
so I suggest you stay
the night out of town.

47:12.698 --> 47:14.533
Okay, I can do that.

47:17.402 --> 47:19.368
Is there anything you can
tell me that might make I

47:19.370 --> 47:23.372
time here a little
bit more productive.

47:23.374 --> 47:27.278
I could, but I appreciate
what I've got here.

47:33.519 --> 47:37.053
Every whisper is a
scream in this town.

47:45.964 --> 47:50.366
Hey you're not from
Brookensfield high are you?

47:50.368 --> 47:51.501
What?

47:51.503 --> 47:54.838
You're not snooping
on us are you?

47:54.840 --> 47:56.673
See we kinda come in
first every year in

47:56.675 --> 47:58.474
the district for
raising the most money,

47:58.476 --> 48:00.744
a couple of the other
schools get a little jealous,

48:00.746 --> 48:02.145
you know.

48:02.147 --> 48:05.515
We had a kid from
Hickory one time imposed,

48:05.517 --> 48:06.585
alright then.

48:15.527 --> 48:17.594
You're not from
around here are you?

48:17.596 --> 48:19.095
See I know everyone from here,

48:19.097 --> 48:22.932
and I think I'd remember
a face like yours.

48:22.934 --> 48:26.435
Look I'm sorry I
bothered you alright,

48:26.437 --> 48:27.505
I'm gonna go.

48:30.141 --> 48:31.076
Hey wait.

48:33.278 --> 48:36.214
Can you help me
out with something?

48:54.132 --> 48:56.199
You look like you have
to tell me something.

48:56.201 --> 48:57.934
So, the boy.

48:57.936 --> 48:59.569
Wait, what boy.

48:59.571 --> 49:02.105
The boy, he was like
doing a fundraiser for

49:02.107 --> 49:03.640
high school or something.

49:03.642 --> 49:06.275
Just boy, you
didn't get his name?

49:06.277 --> 49:08.077
No, he knocked on my window,

49:08.079 --> 49:11.249
like trying to hit
on me or something.

49:12.417 --> 49:14.684
I did get a name and
address from him,

49:14.686 --> 49:17.386
supposedly from the
woman who found you guys.

49:17.388 --> 49:19.388
What's the address?

49:19.390 --> 49:21.190
145 pleasant valley...

49:21.192 --> 49:22.360
Valley road.

49:24.863 --> 49:26.364
Alright, let's go.

49:27.198 --> 49:28.397
Alright.

49:28.399 --> 49:31.367
Wait, we're about
to show up at an

49:31.369 --> 49:35.104
address that two complete
strangers gave us?

49:35.106 --> 49:35.941
Yeah.

49:37.175 --> 49:39.778
Well what the fuck, let's go.

49:55.994 --> 49:57.360
I don't see anyone.

49:57.362 --> 49:58.494
I don't think anybody is here.

49:58.496 --> 49:59.763
Well keep your eyes out,

49:59.765 --> 50:02.899
we're looking for any
kind of movement here.

50:02.901 --> 50:04.433
No I don't see anybody there,

50:04.435 --> 50:07.403
I don't think anyone
is there, really.

50:07.405 --> 50:08.674
Alright here,

50:09.875 --> 50:10.674
I'm gonna call you
when I want you to

50:10.676 --> 50:11.340
come pick me up alright?

50:11.342 --> 50:12.575
Wait, what?

50:12.577 --> 50:14.143
Look if you don't here
from me in 30 minutes,

50:14.145 --> 50:15.511
call the police.

50:15.513 --> 50:16.347
Okay.

51:28.353 --> 51:29.585
I got nothing, I got nothing,

51:29.587 --> 51:32.223
none of this shit
looks familiar.

51:36.394 --> 51:37.360
Yeah, this aint it.

51:37.362 --> 51:38.895
This isn't it.

51:38.897 --> 51:41.833
I don't remember
none of this shit.

51:50.408 --> 51:51.908
Look this may not be the barn,

51:51.910 --> 51:54.043
but it's gotta be
around here somewhere,

51:54.045 --> 51:56.012
you obviously
remembered this much,

51:56.014 --> 51:58.281
I mean it cant be
that far a way,

51:58.283 --> 51:59.482
we're not just gonna give up,

51:59.484 --> 52:01.317
we're not just gonna go home.

52:01.319 --> 52:03.219
We're just gonna search every
fucking barm out here, huh?

52:03.221 --> 52:04.720
You know if we
have to we will,

52:04.722 --> 52:05.955
I mean, Jesus,

52:05.957 --> 52:07.456
I want to know what
happened to my sister,

52:07.458 --> 52:09.292
I wanna know what the fuck
happened to you, I mean,

52:10.628 --> 52:12.128
what the fuck?

52:14.900 --> 52:16.234
He's shooting.

52:19.771 --> 52:20.603
Shit.

52:20.605 --> 52:21.773
You see him?

52:26.511 --> 52:27.911
I can't see, shit in my eyes.

52:27.913 --> 52:29.145
Jesus let me have it.

52:29.147 --> 52:30.013
What are you doing?

52:30.015 --> 52:31.247
I can see.

52:31.249 --> 52:33.082
NO, you're gonna get
your head blown off.

52:33.084 --> 52:37.255
Look we're in this together
now, okay, just let me do it.

52:43.128 --> 52:43.960
What?

52:43.962 --> 52:44.894
Talk to me.

52:44.896 --> 52:46.095
I missed him, I missed him.

52:46.097 --> 52:48.967
Just give me a bullet,
give me a bullet.

52:57.843 --> 52:58.676
Come on.

52:59.710 --> 53:00.676
Do you have more bullets?

53:00.678 --> 53:01.512
Yeah.

53:03.781 --> 53:06.382
I don't see him
any more at all,

53:06.384 --> 53:07.986
I think we got him.

53:35.346 --> 53:37.082
Hey, I can see you!

53:41.987 --> 53:42.820
Stand up.

54:11.149 --> 54:13.582
Why were you shooting at us?

54:13.584 --> 54:14.783
Huh?

54:14.785 --> 54:16.454
What were you doing?

56:38.629 --> 56:40.296
Get over here,

56:40.298 --> 56:42.798
let's not fuck up this time,

56:42.800 --> 56:43.901
hello, hello?

56:45.903 --> 56:47.172
Son of a bitch.

57:03.121 --> 57:05.154
Okay you stay down here,

57:05.156 --> 57:06.622
see what's gong on outside.

57:06.624 --> 57:08.459
Where are you going?

57:09.460 --> 57:11.196
I'm going upstairs.

58:52.963 --> 58:53.796
You know who I am

58:53.798 --> 58:54.632
don't you?

58:55.866 --> 58:56.799
Good.

58:56.801 --> 58:58.000
I wouldn't want to break up a

58:58.002 --> 58:59.635
happy family for
some stupid mistake.

58:59.637 --> 59:01.103
Are you gonna tell me
what I want to know?

59:01.105 --> 59:02.037
Where am I supposed to go,

59:02.039 --> 59:03.872
I want names, you understand?

59:03.874 --> 59:05.107
I don't know what the hell...

59:05.109 --> 59:07.009
Would you give
me, it's bullshit.

59:07.011 --> 59:08.811
I don't want to be here any
more than you want me to.

59:08.813 --> 59:10.246
If this is about the money,

59:10.248 --> 59:11.747
I don't have it, I spent it,

59:11.749 --> 59:12.681
I'm broke.

59:12.683 --> 59:13.416
What are you talking about,

59:13.418 --> 59:14.650
what money?

59:14.652 --> 59:15.551
You know what
I'm talking about,

59:15.553 --> 59:16.885
you know all about it.

59:16.887 --> 59:17.720
Who paid you?

59:17.722 --> 59:18.989
I don't know!

59:22.026 --> 59:23.326
Whose on the other
end of this line?

59:23.328 --> 59:25.496
I want a name and address.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.543
What do you want?

01:00:47.545 --> 01:00:48.777
I think somebody
who jumps out of a

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:50.746
second story window
knows something.

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:51.916
No, I don't.

01:00:54.452 --> 01:00:56.554
My name's Irene Kurtsner,

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:01.089
I live in Eldersville,
Pennsylvania,

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:03.193
what do you want to know?

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:07.965
I want to know if my wife

01:01:10.335 --> 01:01:12.535
is dead or alive.

01:01:12.537 --> 01:01:14.670
I don't know what
you're talking about,

01:01:14.672 --> 01:01:17.942
we're nice people,
just leave us alone.

01:01:20.711 --> 01:01:23.648
Your family is
far from nice mam.

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:28.851
Now I have to track
down that young boy,

01:01:28.853 --> 01:01:32.220
and I bet he's the only
honest one in this family.

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:33.057
No!

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:34.825
Not my boy!

01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:45.536
You can't leave me.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.824
The keys are in the ignition.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:12.060
I thought about leaving.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:14.096
We have one more place to go.

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:16.033
How do you know that?

01:02:18.669 --> 01:02:21.504
These people, they're
involved, they're all involved.

01:02:21.506 --> 01:02:24.206
They ain't running the show,

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.674
that man that was
upstairs on the phone,

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:28.844
I heard him, he wasn't
talking to the cops,

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.681
it was a local number,

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:33.682
Well call it.

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:34.683
No,

01:02:34.685 --> 01:02:37.121
whoever it was they're close.

01:02:38.556 --> 01:02:41.223
I seen that kid from the house,

01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:42.391
we're gonna pick him up,

01:02:42.393 --> 01:02:44.161
he'll lead us to him.

01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:47.863
I hope he takes us
to the right place.

01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:48.699
He will.

01:02:52.202 --> 01:02:53.971
It's a family affair.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:09.785
Hey where are you headed.

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.722
We can give you a ride.

01:03:12.557 --> 01:03:13.756
We'll take you there,

01:03:13.758 --> 01:03:17.059
looks like we're
headed the same way.

01:03:17.061 --> 01:03:20.463
You're in charge, tell
us where you want to go.

01:03:20.465 --> 01:03:23.801
Can you take me to
my grandpa's house.

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:31.874
Know where we're going?

01:03:31.876 --> 01:03:32.710
Yep,

01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:36.647
starting to see
things clearly now.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.254
That's the house
over there isn't it?

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:47.091
Yeah.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.940
Hey Max, who lives in there?

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:06.509
My grandpa.

01:04:06.511 --> 01:04:08.944
Yeah, I mean who else.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:11.015
Uncle Bob, Suzy, Peggy.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:18.253
Are you still with me?

01:04:18.255 --> 01:04:20.257
What are you thinking?

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:26.061
My grandpa has one like that.

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:26.897
He does?

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:28.966
Great.

01:05:04.935 --> 01:05:07.435
Hey, they know we're coming.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:09.004
How do you know.

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:10.205
Max seen me make a
phone call before I

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:11.807
could make it upstairs,

01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:15.243
so we might be waking
into some shit here.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:17.748
And one more thing, thank you.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.717
Go, go,
go, nine years old

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:55.483
Yeah.

01:05:57.855 --> 01:05:58.687
Can I pop?

01:05:58.689 --> 01:05:59.523
Yeah.

01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:11.734
Who knows who I
am and why I'm here?

01:06:11.736 --> 01:06:12.935
I don't know why you're here,

01:06:12.937 --> 01:06:14.569
why don't you just
go ahead and tell us.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:15.906
Not one guess?

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:20.110
Come on, somebody please guess.

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.446
Look just take what you
want and leave us alone okay?

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:27.449
So you think I'm here to
take something from you.

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:30.118
That really why
you think I'm here.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.353
That amazes me
that you think I've

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:34.391
come here to take
something from you.

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:37.662
What about you?

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:41.997
If you're here to scare
my family, you succeeded.

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:43.668
Now pick your fight,

01:06:44.769 --> 01:06:46.036
say your piece,

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.106
or leave us alone.

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:58.146
Do you know anyone named Kay?

01:06:58.148 --> 01:06:58.981
Kay?

01:06:58.983 --> 01:07:00.215
Nothing?

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:02.651
Doesn't ring a bell, not a clue?

01:07:02.653 --> 01:07:03.952
What about this face, huh?

01:07:03.954 --> 01:07:06.088
Does this ring a bell?

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:07.524
I remember you.

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:11.960
I remember what happened to you.

01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:14.564
This whole town remembers that.

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:18.533
You know, actually
you saved my life,

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:21.036
you drove me to
Washington hospital,

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:24.308
now I don't know what
else to tell you.

01:07:29.113 --> 01:07:31.680
From what you just said to me,

01:07:31.682 --> 01:07:34.282
I have to say thank you.

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:35.450
Now I know without a doubt,

01:07:35.452 --> 01:07:37.886
this was all worth it.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:40.956
Go, take them to the other room.

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:43.859
Go on, get over there kids.

01:07:43.861 --> 01:07:47.062
The measure of a man is how
he bears up under hardship.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:49.898
I'm not leaving here, until
I get some kind of proof.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.071
What about you sweetheart,
how did he rope you into this?

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:56.504
I'm Kay's sister,

01:07:56.506 --> 01:08:00.508
and I'm here to find out
what happened to her.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.745
You look more scared
honey than we are,

01:08:02.747 --> 01:08:03.846
I know you been through a lot,

01:08:03.848 --> 01:08:05.848
but if you leave right now,

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:08.150
I won't talk to the police
until tomorrow morning,

01:08:08.152 --> 01:08:11.286
and I'll say you
were never here.

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.123
You got my word on it,

01:08:14.224 --> 01:08:16.725
and the lives of my children.

01:08:16.727 --> 01:08:18.326
I'm not innocent,

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:21.832
I'm probably the most
evil person in here.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:24.933
That's a nice new
truck you got out there.

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:25.868
What do you think,

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.335
we're living high on a hog here?

01:08:27.337 --> 01:08:28.270
You wanna tour around,

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:29.470
do you see anything new here?

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:31.506
Oh yeah, this party,

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:33.175
yeah look at,

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:34.943
it's the best we can do.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:36.644
You come in here an accuse me of

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:39.383
doing something
so sickening boy.

01:08:55.732 --> 01:08:57.399
This is worth 90 dollars.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:08:58.867
Not for sale.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.636
IT's the only gift I
got from Kay's father,

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.205
he found it on the
side of the road,

01:09:03.207 --> 01:09:05.506
and I used to keep my
electronic cigarettes in there,

01:09:05.509 --> 01:09:06.573
if I look around,

01:09:06.576 --> 01:09:08.877
I'm sure I'll find those too.

01:09:08.879 --> 01:09:09.812
Those are mine, I'm...

01:09:09.814 --> 01:09:11.212
Tell me where my wife is.

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:13.081
Now I know you don't believe me,

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:16.684
but I swear to god I'll
let your family go.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.921
Life is the curse,

01:09:18.923 --> 01:09:20.590
sleep the remission,

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:23.359
death is the cure.

01:09:29.867 --> 01:09:30.700
What now?

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:54.656
this show wasn't
worth it, was it?

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:55.492
Was it?

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.894
Why didn't you do this
right to begin with.

01:11:05.896 --> 01:11:08.232
I didn't oversee anything.

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:12.136
They told me you
were taken care of.

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.473
How much did you take?

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:21.977
Just as much as they
were willing to give.

01:11:21.979 --> 01:11:22.913
For what?

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:27.849
You really don't
remember do you?

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:29.451
It's a very, very nasty thing,

01:11:29.453 --> 01:11:30.387
sick thing.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:34.024
From a miserable individual.

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:36.193
No.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.628
You're wrong.

01:11:40.264 --> 01:11:41.765
I'm not like that.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:46.734
I'm gonna walk out of here.

01:11:46.736 --> 01:11:48.005
I want to live.

01:11:51.575 --> 01:11:54.542
We're way beyond
that point son.

01:11:54.544 --> 01:11:55.379
I'm sorry.

01:11:59.016 --> 01:12:00.617
Is Kay down there?

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:04.819
You'll be seeing
her soon enough,

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.223
I'm sure of that.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.963
She was another real gem.

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:20.204
You two made the perfect couple.

01:12:22.973 --> 01:12:23.807
Come on.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:24.952
No!

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:26.854
Help. Let me out!

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:27.691
Shut up!

01:15:45.609 --> 01:15:47.008
Help me.

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:47.844
Help me.

01:16:20.244 --> 01:16:21.911
You fucking bastard.

01:18:39.282 --> 01:18:41.182
What the fuck are you
doing here, little sister,

01:18:41.184 --> 01:18:42.016
you look like you seen a ghost.

01:18:42.018 --> 01:18:43.019
You alright?

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:48.490
Yeah, I just came to
get some paperwork so

01:18:48.492 --> 01:18:49.757
mom can sell this house,

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:51.225
I told her to get it,

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.428
but you had changed the locks
and so I hadn't figured on

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:55.797
that, I had to climb through
a fucking window downstairs.

01:18:55.799 --> 01:18:57.865
Wait, do mom and dad
know what you're doing?

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:59.701
Yes, yes, they kept me
up with what's going on,

01:18:59.703 --> 01:19:00.935
you know I think it would
have been pretty cool if I

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:03.170
could have gone to
my funeral service.

01:19:03.172 --> 01:19:06.708
Vint's dead, he died
trying to find you.

01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:08.778
Really, that's too bad.

01:19:10.213 --> 01:19:11.879
You know he got
what he deserved.

01:19:11.881 --> 01:19:15.216
What the fuck do you mean
he got what he deserved.

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:17.118
He tried to kill me,
the little fucker...

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.453
I don't believe that,
I don't believe it,

01:19:18.455 --> 01:19:20.354
Vint's dead, and
you're on vacation,

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:22.289
just having realized
how many innocent people

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:23.758
died because of you?

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:27.294
Well you know
what, life is cruel.

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:28.129
Life is cruel,

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:28.963
I'm here,

01:19:28.965 --> 01:19:30.197
so you know what,

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:31.599
I'm here, and that's
all that matters.

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:33.000
How the fuck are
you still here,

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.402
how did you swing that?

01:19:34.404 --> 01:19:35.470
You know you pay
somebody twice the money,

01:19:35.472 --> 01:19:36.337
and give them better store,

01:19:36.339 --> 01:19:37.171
and you get anyone,

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:38.640
just anyone,

01:19:38.642 --> 01:19:41.175
especially a man to do just
about anything you want.

01:19:41.177 --> 01:19:43.177
Did you met Adam?

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:46.182
You met Adam right,
he's a good guy.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:50.019
I have no idea
what you've done.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.920
Okay, you know
what little sister,

01:19:52.922 --> 01:19:55.156
this is why you
weren't involved,

01:19:55.158 --> 01:19:56.724
because you're still a child,

01:19:56.726 --> 01:19:58.225
I was miserable
plain and simple,

01:19:58.227 --> 01:20:00.762
and now I'm happy, and I've
got a man and I've got a life,

01:20:00.764 --> 01:20:02.229
and I've got a flight
in about three hours,

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:03.698
so if you could please
help me and tell me

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.568
where my fucking jewelry is.

01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:07.401
Then I could be,

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:08.570
oh, you're shaking.

01:20:08.572 --> 01:20:10.404
It's in the
fucking guest room.

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:14.308
Why did you put it in the
fucking guest room closet.

01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:02.309
Want a pancake, huh?

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:03.146
No?

01:23:05.715 --> 01:23:08.382
That was good,

01:23:08.384 --> 01:23:09.218
cut.
