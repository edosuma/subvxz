WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:04.314
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.452 --> 00:07.455
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.593 --> 00:11.977
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.115 --> 00:14.945
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:15.084 --> 00:18.018
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:18.156 --> 00:21.987
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.747 --> 00:26.095
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.233 --> 00:28.925
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:29.063 --> 00:31.376
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.514 --> 00:34.172
Just to get up that hill

00:34.310 --> 00:36.760
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.898 --> 00:39.349
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.487 --> 00:41.903
As long as we live
it's you and me, baby

00:42.042 --> 00:43.560
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.698 --> 00:46.460
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.598 --> 00:49.463
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.601 --> 00:54.019
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:54.157 --> 00:56.953
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:57.091 --> 00:59.956
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:00.094 --> 01:05.168
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:15.489 --> 01:17.215
Oh, good morning,
Florence.

01:17.353 --> 01:19.700
Have you seen
where George...
Shh, shh.

01:20.942 --> 01:22.151
Oh, my God,

01:22.289 --> 01:23.842
he must have been
working all night.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.119
As usual.

01:25.809 --> 01:28.398
Oh, look at that.

01:28.536 --> 01:31.298
Isn't George cute
when he's sleeping?

01:31.436 --> 01:33.162
He's cute anytime
his mouth is shut.

01:38.477 --> 01:39.996
He just stopped
being cute.

01:42.585 --> 01:43.862
I guess we should
wake him up.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.381
I know how to
handle that.

01:45.519 --> 01:46.554
So do I.

01:46.692 --> 01:48.591
Hey, Mister Jefferson,
time to get up!

01:52.077 --> 01:54.010
What are you trying to do,
scare me to death?

01:54.148 --> 01:56.771
That was Florence.
I was trying
to be gentle.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.290
Well the next time
you're trying to be gentle,

01:58.428 --> 01:59.981
don't be coming at
me like a vacuum cleaner.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.885
Well, I'm glad
to see you got up
in a good mood.

02:07.023 --> 02:08.542
Look, just cut the jokes,
Weezy.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.130
Florence, how about
some coffee?

02:11.372 --> 02:13.167
Now I gotta do
all this stuff tonight.

02:13.305 --> 02:14.755
Oh, not again.

02:14.893 --> 02:16.550
George, you're working
too hard.

02:16.688 --> 02:18.621
Hmm... Well look,
I like to work long hours.

02:18.759 --> 02:20.312
I'm built that way.

02:20.450 --> 02:23.419
Well, if you worked the way
you were built,
you would have short hours.

02:25.662 --> 02:26.801
What's bugging you?

02:26.939 --> 02:28.527
Your cleaners,
that's what.

02:28.665 --> 02:30.771
We never spend time
together anymore.

02:30.909 --> 02:33.049
Didn't we go out to dinner
together twice last week?

02:33.187 --> 02:36.501
Yeah, with a starch salesman,
and boy, did he get stiffed.

02:41.368 --> 02:43.093
I'm serious.

02:43.232 --> 02:44.819
George, you're so
wrapped up in your work,

02:44.957 --> 02:48.168
I'm beginning to wonder
if I'm your wife
or just a tax deduction.

02:48.306 --> 02:50.894
Oh, come on, Weezy,
you know the answer to that.

02:52.344 --> 02:53.449
You're both.

02:55.796 --> 02:56.728
George!

02:56.866 --> 02:58.143
Just kidding, Weezy.

02:58.281 --> 03:00.352
Look, I'll try to spend
more time with you
from now on.

03:00.490 --> 03:02.112
Oh, really, George?

03:04.736 --> 03:06.807
Well, if this is what
you all do at nine o'clock
in the morning,

03:06.945 --> 03:08.774
no telling what'll be
happening at lunch time.

03:13.123 --> 03:14.918
You know the one nice thing
about you, Florence?

03:15.056 --> 03:16.161
No, what?

03:16.299 --> 03:17.542
See that?
You don't know either.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.445
George, I can't wait
for Coney Island
Wednesday night.

03:24.583 --> 03:25.515
Coney Island?

03:25.653 --> 03:27.034
That ain't for rich folks
like you all.

03:27.172 --> 03:29.139
We weren't always rich,
you know.

03:29.278 --> 03:31.383
That's where George
proposed to me.

03:31.521 --> 03:35.387
And every year we go back
to relive that night.

03:35.525 --> 03:38.425
You mean you actually
celebrate the night you got
hooked up with him?

03:40.979 --> 03:43.257
Florence,
it was beautiful.

03:43.395 --> 03:46.329
First we ate cotton candy
and hot dogs.

03:46.467 --> 03:47.813
Then we rode
the Whip.

03:47.951 --> 03:50.022
And then they closed down
the Whip to clean it.

03:50.506 --> 03:51.921
Why?

03:52.059 --> 03:54.303
Because George
shouldn't eat before
he rides the Whip.

03:57.340 --> 03:59.342
Well, eating a lot
of junk food and going
on some rides

03:59.480 --> 04:01.241
don't sound
romantic to me.

04:01.379 --> 04:05.797
Well, we did add
one thing to the night.

04:05.935 --> 04:07.833
But only after
we got married.

04:07.971 --> 04:09.559
All right, Weezy,
that's enough.

04:09.697 --> 04:12.148
The maid ain't gotta
know all the details
of our personal life.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.839
Oh, you don't have to
worry about me,
Mister Jefferson.

04:13.977 --> 04:15.669
I don't hear nothin'
that goes on around here.

04:15.807 --> 04:17.636
Oh.
Tiger.

04:22.503 --> 04:25.057
I'm sorry, George,
I didn't mean to
embarrass you,

04:25.195 --> 04:27.612
but I'm really
looking forward
to Coney Island.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.752
Yeah, too bad
we can't go this year.

04:29.890 --> 04:31.478
What?

04:31.616 --> 04:33.583
That's the same night
as my Special Store
Manager's Meeting.

04:33.721 --> 04:35.067
We're changing our prices
the next day.

04:35.205 --> 04:36.172
I gotta be there.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.380
What about me?

04:38.174 --> 04:39.555
You can come,
if you want.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.972
I mean,
Coney Island.

04:43.110 --> 04:44.939
I'm not going there
by myself.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.389
Well,
take Florence.

04:46.527 --> 04:47.977
Maybe you'll get lucky
and lose her.

04:50.945 --> 04:52.671
Oh, Helen, Tom.
Hi, there, Louise.

04:52.809 --> 04:54.086
Come in.
Hi.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.330
What do you two want?

04:56.468 --> 04:58.159
Take it easy, George.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.782
We just came over
to see Louise.

04:59.920 --> 05:00.990
Oh...
Oh!

05:01.128 --> 05:04.027
Okay, now you've
seen her. Bye.

05:04.165 --> 05:08.066
Louise, we got this crazy
urge to run over to the park
to play badminton.

05:08.204 --> 05:09.481
Wanna come?

05:09.619 --> 05:11.138
Badminton?
What kind of
stupid game is that?

05:11.276 --> 05:12.346
Well, it's a lot
like tennis,

05:12.484 --> 05:14.348
only instead of a ball,
you hit a bird.

05:14.486 --> 05:16.143
Oh, well that's
just great, Willis.

05:16.281 --> 05:17.662
Why don't you
and your bird
fly out of here?

05:20.112 --> 05:22.839
George, will you
please be more civil?

05:22.977 --> 05:25.532
Say, George,
why don't you
come along with us?

05:25.670 --> 05:26.912
I can't.
I gotta work.

05:27.465 --> 05:28.604
There, you see?

05:28.742 --> 05:30.744
The Willises'
find time
to spend together.

05:30.882 --> 05:32.815
Well, they got to
stay together.

05:32.953 --> 05:34.403
Whoever heard of
half a zebra?

05:39.684 --> 05:43.791
Whoever heard of
half a brain,
but you manage.

05:43.929 --> 05:46.587
Oh, sounds like
we walked into
the middle of a fight.

05:46.725 --> 05:48.555
You're darn right
you did.

05:48.693 --> 05:51.316
Helen, what would
you say if you and Tom

05:51.454 --> 05:53.801
always celebrated
the night he proposed,

05:53.939 --> 05:57.184
but this year
you can't celebrate
because he's too busy?

05:57.322 --> 06:01.533
I'd say he was a stubborn,
miserable, selfish,
no good jackass.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.639
You'd say that
to me?

06:03.777 --> 06:06.193
No. I'd say that
to George.

06:08.540 --> 06:10.956
I never forget
our special night.

06:11.094 --> 06:13.165
Helen and I
celebrate the night
we told our parents

06:13.303 --> 06:14.615
we were getting married.

06:14.753 --> 06:17.031
We call it
"Gunfight at
the O.K. Corral."

06:18.447 --> 06:20.449
Some fight.
Everybody lost.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.661
You know what your
trouble is, George?

06:25.799 --> 06:26.972
Yep.
Nosey neighbors.

06:28.940 --> 06:31.563
Your business is getting
too big for you to handle.

06:31.701 --> 06:33.669
You're trying to carry
the same responsibilities

06:33.807 --> 06:36.741
for seven stores
that you used to carry
for one.

06:36.879 --> 06:39.226
Face it, George,
you're only human.

06:39.364 --> 06:41.228
All the votes aren't in
on that one yet.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.887
Tom's absolutely right,
George.

06:45.025 --> 06:46.716
He ain't right
about nothin'.

06:46.854 --> 06:49.167
All I'm trying to say
is that you've got
a big business now,

06:49.305 --> 06:51.031
and you're still
running it
like a small one.

06:51.169 --> 06:54.897
So?
So do what other businesses
do when they get big.

06:55.035 --> 06:57.002
I ain't got
enough money to
bribe a senator.

06:58.590 --> 07:00.799
No. I mean
hire an assistant.

07:00.937 --> 07:03.561
A general manager,
working directly under you

07:03.699 --> 07:05.804
to take some of the work
off your shoulders.

07:05.942 --> 07:08.082
George,
that's the answer!

07:08.220 --> 07:10.809
I think so, too.
That's a wonderful idea.

07:10.947 --> 07:12.466
I think it stinks.

07:12.604 --> 07:14.364
Why?
'Cause he thought of it.

07:16.505 --> 07:17.540
You hear that?

07:17.678 --> 07:20.198
And they all laughed
at Henry Ford, too.

07:20.336 --> 07:21.924
Only when he
pardoned Nixon.

07:25.652 --> 07:27.308
George, I'm just
trying to give you
some advice.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.586
Look, I don't
need your advice!

07:28.724 --> 07:30.001
Just stay out
of my business!

07:30.139 --> 07:32.279
Oh, you've got to relax.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.730
Come on out and play
some badminton with us.

07:34.868 --> 07:36.317
Oh, look out here.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.113
It's a beautiful day.

07:39.251 --> 07:42.151
Ah... Just smell
that fresh air.

07:42.289 --> 07:43.532
I don't want to.

07:43.670 --> 07:45.430
And I don't wanna play
your old stupid game,
either.

07:45.568 --> 07:47.984
Oh, afraid it'll be
too hard for you, George?

07:48.122 --> 07:49.469
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you
talking about?

07:49.607 --> 07:51.505
All you gotta do
is take the racket
and hit the stupid thing.

07:51.643 --> 07:52.920
Oh my God!

07:55.613 --> 07:56.924
Hey, look out down there!

07:57.062 --> 07:59.755
Oh no, oh... Oh.

07:59.893 --> 08:02.171
A bus ran over my bird!

08:03.862 --> 08:05.726
Well keep your eye on it
till the ambulance comes.

08:11.145 --> 08:12.457
Hey, I finally
got rid of him.

08:19.015 --> 08:22.674
That wasn't very nice,
George. Come on, Helen.

08:28.784 --> 08:30.268
You owe me a bird!

08:30.406 --> 08:32.304
You got it!

08:36.654 --> 08:38.172
George, how could you
do that?

08:38.310 --> 08:39.933
I didn't mean to do it.

08:40.071 --> 08:42.107
Anyway, it serves him
right for trying to tell me
how to run my business.

08:42.245 --> 08:44.109
He meant well.

08:44.247 --> 08:47.492
Besides, the more I think
about a general manager,
the more I like the idea.

08:47.630 --> 08:49.321
Well, I ain't hiring one.

08:49.459 --> 08:51.013
I know why
you're against it.

08:51.151 --> 08:53.049
Because you don't think
there's no one on earth

08:53.187 --> 08:55.051
who can do your job
as well as you can.

08:55.189 --> 08:56.328
Bingo!

08:57.122 --> 08:58.848
Hold it, George!

08:58.986 --> 09:00.885
I'm not through with you!

09:01.023 --> 09:04.682
Don't you see
what all your success
is turning us into?

09:04.820 --> 09:06.407
Yep. Rich people.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.617
No, rich strangers.

09:08.755 --> 09:10.411
Look, Weezy,
I'm doing it all for you.

09:11.481 --> 09:13.138
Who wants to live in
a big fancy apartment?

09:13.622 --> 09:14.692
You do.

09:14.830 --> 09:17.660
Oh... Who wants to rub
elbows with high society?

09:17.798 --> 09:19.593
You do.

09:19.731 --> 09:22.458
Okay, well who is it that
wants all the spending money
in the world?

09:22.596 --> 09:23.735
I do.

09:25.979 --> 09:27.118
You stay out of this.

09:27.256 --> 09:28.395
I can talk if I want to.

09:28.533 --> 09:29.914
This ain't Uncle Tom's cabin.

09:37.197 --> 09:39.440
No, this is Uncle George's
condominium.

09:40.890 --> 09:42.858
And I'm telling you
to shut-up!

09:45.723 --> 09:48.070
George, I'm through
sharing you
with your business.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.486
You are gonna hire
a general manager.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.626
There's nobody qualified.

09:52.764 --> 09:54.317
What about Clarence Martin?

09:55.077 --> 09:56.388
Clarence Martin?

09:56.526 --> 09:58.528
Yeah.
He's the manager of
your Brooklyn store.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.083
You are always saying
what a nice job he does.

10:01.221 --> 10:02.498
I lied.

10:04.534 --> 10:06.295
Why don't you call
Clarence and talk to him?

10:06.433 --> 10:08.021
I bet he's perfect
for the job.

10:08.159 --> 10:09.919
Weezy, this is my business.

10:10.057 --> 10:11.852
I do the hiring,
you do the buttin' out.

10:11.990 --> 10:13.992
George!

10:14.130 --> 10:16.098
This discussion is over,
through, finished.

10:16.236 --> 10:17.582
Not quite!

10:17.720 --> 10:20.067
This has been
building up
for a long time.

10:20.205 --> 10:22.276
This year you miss
Coney Island.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.762
Next year it'll be
our anniversary.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.488
Pretty soon you'll be
living in your damn stores!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.629
I ain't listening no more.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.216
Well, you had
better listen!

10:31.354 --> 10:34.530
Because I'm your wife,
and I have my rights, too!

10:35.427 --> 10:37.637
You are gonna hire
a general manager!

10:37.775 --> 10:39.708
When hell freezes over!

10:41.710 --> 10:44.195
Then grab
your overcoat, buster...

10:51.720 --> 10:55.585
...because it's gonna be
colder than that
in our bedroom tonight.

10:59.555 --> 11:02.869
Weezy...
And I mean cold.

11:16.330 --> 11:17.987
Hey, Florence,
how 'bout an egg
salad sandwich?

11:18.125 --> 11:19.437
Oh no, thanks.
I already ate.

11:25.029 --> 11:26.133
I mean for me.

11:26.271 --> 11:27.514
I saw a bowl of it
in there.

11:27.652 --> 11:29.619
You better look again,
'cause that's what I ate.

11:31.587 --> 11:33.554
Okay then, give me
some of that
leftover turkey.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.832
That should made
a good snack.

11:34.970 --> 11:36.178
It sure did.

11:38.352 --> 11:39.664
You ate that, too?

11:39.802 --> 11:41.770
How can I work
if I don't eat?

11:41.908 --> 11:43.633
How can you work
if all you do is eat?

11:44.807 --> 11:46.257
There's a can of
sardines in the cupboard.

11:46.395 --> 11:47.948
Oh, I hate sardines.

11:48.086 --> 11:49.674
Me, too. That's why
it's still in there.

11:54.127 --> 11:57.786
Oh, Florence, good,
this should go
in the oven at five.

11:57.924 --> 12:00.547
Okay. I wouldn't go
in there if I was you.

12:00.685 --> 12:02.031
Mister Jefferson's
going over the answers

12:02.169 --> 12:03.895
to his ad
for a general manager.

12:04.033 --> 12:05.586
Is he in a bad mood?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.450
Has Sammy Davis
got jewelry?

12:09.867 --> 12:11.454
Well that's too bad.

12:11.592 --> 12:14.388
But George is just gonna
have to live through it.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.568
Hello, George sweetheart.

12:21.706 --> 12:23.535
My goodness,

12:23.673 --> 12:28.023
just look at all the answers
that newspaper ad brought you
in just one week.

12:28.161 --> 12:29.127
How's it going?

12:29.265 --> 12:30.404
Lousy.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.923
If these are the people
that read our paper,

12:32.061 --> 12:34.339
I'm canceling
my subscription.

12:34.477 --> 12:37.101
Oh, come on,
it can't be that bad.

12:37.239 --> 12:39.517
You already got it
sorted into piles.

12:39.655 --> 12:42.416
Yeah, Rejects,
Forget It,
and Not Qualified.

12:43.901 --> 12:45.765
I knew you'd make it hard.

12:45.903 --> 12:48.802
Well, it is!
I already opened more
letters than the C.I.A.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.289
Oh, hello, Mister Bentley.

12:53.427 --> 12:55.188
Ah, Mrs. J, Mister J.

12:55.326 --> 12:59.226
I'm sorry to barge in,
but I just finished it,
and I had to show someone.

12:59.364 --> 13:00.400
Show us what?

13:00.538 --> 13:03.748
This. What do you think?

13:05.854 --> 13:07.614
I think you should
change liquor stores.

13:07.752 --> 13:09.547
Your bottle's got
a boat in it.

13:09.685 --> 13:11.514
Why no, I put it there.

13:11.652 --> 13:14.241
Oh, Mister Bentley,
that's beautiful.

13:14.379 --> 13:16.485
Oh, thank you.
It took me hours of work.

13:16.623 --> 13:17.727
Do you recognize it?

13:17.866 --> 13:19.315
Yeah, it's a Scotch bottle.

13:19.453 --> 13:21.214
No, it's the Santa Maria.

13:21.352 --> 13:24.458
Christopher Columbus
came across the ocean
in this very boat.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.253
Really?

13:26.391 --> 13:29.394
I always thought
Columbus was much taller.

13:32.328 --> 13:33.882
Look, Bentley,
if you don't mind,
I'm busy right now.

13:34.020 --> 13:37.609
Uh, George has been
running an ad
for a general manager.

13:37.747 --> 13:39.404
Oh, capitol idea,
Mister J.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.027
You could use
a Man Friday.

13:41.165 --> 13:43.615
Why? Saturday's a much
busier day in the store.

13:43.753 --> 13:45.652
Just be careful
about your "Want" ad.

13:45.790 --> 13:48.034
I placed one of those
myself once.

13:48.172 --> 13:49.829
Actually, it was a very
interesting story.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.314
So far it ain't.

13:52.452 --> 13:55.627
You see, I was trying to
sell a Welsh mother-of-pearl
snuff box,

13:55.765 --> 13:58.872
but the newspaper
made a typographical error
so that my ad read,

13:59.010 --> 14:02.289
"For sale
One walk talada bamidgato."

14:04.878 --> 14:06.776
That's ridiculous.

14:06.915 --> 14:09.710
No, the ridiculous part
is the ad got a response.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.436
I received a letter
from a man who claimed

14:11.574 --> 14:14.784
he owned a walk
talada bamidgato
and that he wanted to...

14:14.923 --> 14:16.648
He wanted to mate it
with mine.

14:18.236 --> 14:19.548
Weren't you leaving,
Bentley?

14:19.686 --> 14:22.137
Oh, yes, I believe I am.

14:22.275 --> 14:25.485
You know, it's too bad
that you can't talk to
my Uncle Willard.

14:25.623 --> 14:27.383
He's worked
with newspapers
all his life.

14:27.521 --> 14:28.488
Yeah? What does he do?

14:28.626 --> 14:30.214
He wraps fish in them.
He wraps...

14:37.635 --> 14:39.154
Hey, Weezy,
what are you doing
to those letters?

14:39.292 --> 14:42.778
I find it hard to believe
that you can't find
one qualified person

14:42.916 --> 14:44.262
out of all of these
answers.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.264
Well, I can't,
so just get out of there.

14:46.402 --> 14:48.473
Well, what about this man?

14:48.611 --> 14:50.130
He seems to have
a lot of experience.

14:50.268 --> 14:52.098
What's wrong with him?
He's too fat.

14:53.513 --> 14:55.135
What? How do you know
he's fat?

14:55.273 --> 14:56.792
'Cause there's
ketchup stains
on the letter.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.071
If he ain't too fat,
he's too sloppy.

15:00.209 --> 15:02.004
Oh, you're impossible!

15:02.142 --> 15:04.973
Look, Weezy,
there's nobody here
good enough.

15:05.111 --> 15:08.045
You have no intention
of keeping your part
of the bargain, do you?

15:09.356 --> 15:10.702
Florence, get the door!

15:10.840 --> 15:12.946
George, I'm talking to you!

15:13.084 --> 15:15.466
I know that.
Everybody in the
building knows that.

15:15.604 --> 15:17.192
I'll tell you one thing,

15:17.330 --> 15:19.780
whoever this is,
I hope they brought
ear muffs.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.161
For me, too.

15:23.681 --> 15:26.028
Oh well, hello there.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.410
How you doing,
Mister Jefferson,
Mrs. Jefferson?

15:28.548 --> 15:30.481
Well, hello, Clarence.

15:30.619 --> 15:32.690
Hey, Clarence,
this ain't
your day off!

15:32.828 --> 15:34.243
Why ain't you
in the Brooklyn store?

15:34.381 --> 15:36.487
Oh, my assistant can
handle that for a while,
Mister Jefferson.

15:36.625 --> 15:39.007
You see, I got this
phone call that said

15:39.145 --> 15:41.699
this is where you're hiring
your new general manager.

15:41.837 --> 15:43.390
Phone call?

15:43.528 --> 15:45.323
I thought I told you
to stay out of my business?

15:45.461 --> 15:46.980
Yes, you did, George.

15:47.118 --> 15:49.224
That's why I had
Florence call.

15:51.674 --> 15:53.021
Traitor!

15:53.159 --> 15:55.989
Well, well, well...
Hmm-hmm...

15:56.127 --> 15:57.715
The minute I heard
that voice on the phone,

15:57.853 --> 16:00.890
I knew it had to belong
to one lovely lady.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.309
You don't mean that.

16:05.447 --> 16:07.345
Look, if you've come
to talk business,
you talk to me.

16:07.483 --> 16:09.278
Let the man talk
to who he wants to.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.041
Now what were you saying?

16:13.179 --> 16:16.596
Um, anyone ever told you
what big beautiful
brown eyes you have?

16:16.734 --> 16:17.838
No. But go
right ahead, child.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.426
The truth shall
set you free.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.847
Look, Florence,
Clarence came here
to talk business.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.056
Now either you
get out of here,

16:28.194 --> 16:29.402
or sit down and be quiet!

16:29.540 --> 16:31.818
All right. All right.

16:31.956 --> 16:34.165
You won't hear
another word out of me.

16:34.303 --> 16:36.823
My lips are glued shut.

16:36.961 --> 16:38.618
Try using cement.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.242
Mister Jefferson,
I want this job.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.589
Hmm-hmm... That's why
you ain't gonna get it.

16:44.727 --> 16:47.730
Anybody who's dumb enough
to wanna take on all the work
of being my general manager,

16:47.868 --> 16:49.767
is too dumb
to be my general manager.

16:49.905 --> 16:52.114
That don't make sense.

16:52.252 --> 16:54.737
Oh then, the only way
to get the job is to say
I don't want it?

16:54.875 --> 16:56.981
Right.
All right,
I don't want the job.

16:57.119 --> 16:58.534
Good. 'Cause you ain't
gonna get it.

17:00.191 --> 17:01.503
George!

17:01.641 --> 17:04.333
I mean, it's a lousy job.
Extra hard work.

17:04.471 --> 17:05.610
I can handle it.

17:05.748 --> 17:06.956
You may never get home
to see your family.

17:07.095 --> 17:08.441
I don't have one.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.650
The pay stinks.
I know.
I work for you already.

17:14.102 --> 17:16.069
Clarence came
all the way over here.

17:16.207 --> 17:19.452
He's obviously qualified,
so give him the job!

17:19.590 --> 17:20.970
How do I know
he's qualified?

17:21.109 --> 17:22.489
Try me, Mister Jefferson.

17:23.559 --> 17:25.044
Okay.

17:25.182 --> 17:26.528
You get a call
from the Queens store

17:26.666 --> 17:28.081
that the generator blew out
in the middle of a big load.

17:28.219 --> 17:29.565
What do you do?
Oh, no sweat.

17:29.703 --> 17:31.360
I just switch right over
to the K-One-Fifty.

17:31.498 --> 17:33.293
You hear that?

17:34.156 --> 17:35.226
See?

17:36.469 --> 17:37.677
What is the
K-One-Fifty?

17:40.024 --> 17:42.302
An auxiliary generator.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.718
Oh.
Anymore questions,
George?

17:44.856 --> 17:46.099
Lucky guess.

17:47.307 --> 17:49.309
Uh, then Clarence
gets the job?

17:49.447 --> 17:51.760
Uh-uh. He ain't
executive material.

17:51.898 --> 17:53.796
What?
Look, Weezy,

17:53.934 --> 17:56.937
my general manager
is supposed to represent
all of my cleaners.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.767
How can he
represent my cleaners

17:58.905 --> 18:00.976
when he looks like
he needs cleaning himself.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.668
Now look, Mister Jefferson,
a truck splashed me there.

18:03.806 --> 18:05.429
Now this outfit is new.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.258
Now what you getting
on my case for?

18:07.396 --> 18:09.122
'Cause I just remembered
you ain't a good worker.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.882
Ain't no good worker, man?
I done put...

18:11.020 --> 18:12.919
Uh-huh... Yeah,
I know what it is.

18:13.057 --> 18:15.335
See you mad at me
'cause I knew about
the K-One-Fifty

18:15.473 --> 18:17.579
and you won't admit
your mistake.

18:17.717 --> 18:19.615
I don't have to
admit my mistakes.

18:19.753 --> 18:21.169
I hire them.
What...

18:21.307 --> 18:23.067
Hey, man,
what's going down here?

18:23.205 --> 18:24.413
The elevator. Use it.

18:26.450 --> 18:27.899
Uh-huh.
Now that cuts it, Jack!

18:28.037 --> 18:29.729
I mean that is
the end of it.

18:29.867 --> 18:32.697
Now I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I think of you!

18:32.835 --> 18:34.837
If I got any faults,
I'd like to hear them.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.909
Well, then,
take this chair.

18:38.047 --> 18:39.428
This shouldn't take
but a year.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.399
Did you hear that, Weezy?
I can't work with him.

18:44.537 --> 18:45.745
Oh, wait, wait,
wait a minute,
Mister Jefferson.

18:45.883 --> 18:48.092
I'm not through telling you
what I think of you!

18:48.230 --> 18:50.025
He's crazy! He's crazy!

18:51.060 --> 18:52.338
Nice job interview.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.583
George, I wanna
talk to you.

18:56.721 --> 18:57.929
No.
Yes!

18:58.067 --> 19:01.174
Hey! You almost killed me!

19:01.312 --> 19:03.521
George, you were
very unfair to Clarence.

19:03.659 --> 19:05.454
Now get out there
and apologize to him!

19:05.592 --> 19:06.731
No way!

19:08.077 --> 19:09.320
Okay.

19:12.081 --> 19:14.532
FLORENCE: You'd be
much better off...
Sorry to interrupt.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.258
Go right ahead.

19:17.777 --> 19:19.123
Don't mind me.

19:20.918 --> 19:22.299
It's a family matter.

19:23.058 --> 19:24.197
Nothing really.

19:25.785 --> 19:26.924
Sorry.

19:28.443 --> 19:29.651
What the hell is that?

19:29.789 --> 19:30.962
Your overcoat.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.275
You're gonna have to
wear it to bed tonight.

19:34.587 --> 19:36.761
You're right, Florence.
You are right.

19:36.899 --> 19:38.901
I handled him all wrong.

19:39.039 --> 19:40.869
I just lost my head.

19:41.007 --> 19:42.388
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

19:42.526 --> 19:44.976
Oh...
Nobody can out yell
Mister Jefferson.

19:45.114 --> 19:47.324
He got more mouth
then a dentist
can see in a year.

19:51.155 --> 19:53.364
I just don't know
how to deal with him.

19:53.502 --> 19:55.228
I do.

19:55.366 --> 19:57.989
Now ain't you ever heard
the story of the alligator
and the two bunnies?

19:58.127 --> 20:00.060
No. My library card
expired.

20:02.131 --> 20:03.650
It applies.

20:03.788 --> 20:06.412
Now see,
these two bunnies wanted
to get across the river.

20:06.550 --> 20:09.069
But only the alligator
could swim that far.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.280
Now the first bunny
tried to force the alligator
to take him across.

20:12.418 --> 20:15.317
He said things like,
"Start swimming fin face."

20:16.456 --> 20:18.044
"Let's go, luggage lips."

20:20.115 --> 20:21.806
But see, the alligator
didn't like that.

20:21.944 --> 20:23.946
So the alligator said,
"Yo, mama."

20:28.503 --> 20:31.299
But now the second bunny,
he was smart.

20:31.437 --> 20:34.163
So he said nice things
to the alligator.

20:34.302 --> 20:37.097
Like, "You sure
are a good swimmer."

20:37.236 --> 20:39.341
"I sure hope
they don't make
shoes out of you."

20:39.479 --> 20:42.241
Ah-ha... I dig.

20:42.379 --> 20:44.657
So the alligator
took him across the river.

20:44.795 --> 20:46.314
Right. Now you know
what I'm saying?

20:46.452 --> 20:49.317
Yeah. I gotta learn to be
a smart bunny rabbit.

20:53.631 --> 20:56.393
You insulted that man
because you didn't wanna
hire him.

20:56.531 --> 20:57.911
Now go out there
and apologize!

20:58.049 --> 20:59.775
I can't!
Go!

21:01.260 --> 21:02.744
Oh, boy...

21:08.577 --> 21:10.510
Clarence, I got something
I wanna say to you.

21:13.824 --> 21:15.515
Uh, I, uh...

21:17.068 --> 21:20.520
I just wanted to say
that I apologize.

21:24.869 --> 21:26.492
I don't think
he heard you, George.

21:26.630 --> 21:27.631
Oh.

21:28.183 --> 21:29.322
I said, I...

21:29.460 --> 21:30.979
Before you say anymore,
Mister Jefferson,

21:31.117 --> 21:32.705
I wanna say that
I lost my temper,

21:32.843 --> 21:34.051
and I shouldn't have
done that.

21:34.189 --> 21:35.742
And will you accept
my apology?

21:35.880 --> 21:38.952
Well, sure. Why not?

21:39.090 --> 21:41.161
When I'm wrong,
I'm always the first
to apologize.

21:43.371 --> 21:45.752
I guess I wanted
the job too much.

21:45.890 --> 21:48.134
But you can't
blame me for wanting
to work with you, man,

21:48.272 --> 21:49.825
'cause hey,
you're the best.

21:49.963 --> 21:50.999
That's true.

21:51.137 --> 21:52.483
It was the chance
of a lifetime.

21:52.621 --> 21:55.175
Imagine me being taught
the cleaning business

21:55.314 --> 21:57.937
by the master,
Mister George Jefferson.

21:58.075 --> 21:59.973
That's right.
You'd be a fool
to pass that up.

22:00.111 --> 22:04.357
I figured I'd do anything
to get the job so I could
learn from you.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.842
You know, this guy's
starting to make sense.

22:08.361 --> 22:11.330
But I guess I blew it,
you don't want me, so...

22:11.468 --> 22:12.538
Wait, wait.
Where you going?

22:12.676 --> 22:14.678
Oh, nowhere.
Just walking around
thinking.

22:14.816 --> 22:16.196
With all the work
you got to do?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.509
That ain't no way to
start off as my new
general manager.

22:19.234 --> 22:20.960
Me? I got the job?

22:21.098 --> 22:22.686
Why not? I gotta give it
to somebody,

22:22.824 --> 22:24.308
or else I don't get
no peace.

22:35.077 --> 22:36.941
You can say that again.

22:39.081 --> 22:42.050
Mister Jefferson,
look here, you're gonna
never regret this.

22:42.188 --> 22:43.569
Look, I'm gonna handle
all your bookkeeping,

22:43.707 --> 22:45.605
your payroll, take care of
your supplies for you...

22:45.743 --> 22:48.436
And you can run
the Managers Meeting
tonight.

22:48.574 --> 22:49.644
Oh, Weezy!

22:49.782 --> 22:51.991
While Mister Jefferson
and I go to Coney Island.

22:52.129 --> 22:54.027
Don't worry about a thing,
Mister Jefferson.

22:54.165 --> 22:55.926
I can handle everything.

22:56.064 --> 22:57.237
Yeah, we'll see.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.549
All right. All right.

22:58.687 --> 23:01.138
Oh, uh, Mister Jefferson,
one more thing.

23:01.276 --> 23:03.658
Now that I'm an executive,
about my salary...

23:03.796 --> 23:05.625
Lesson number one
from the master.

23:05.763 --> 23:08.525
An executive never ever,
ever talks about money.

23:08.663 --> 23:09.698
Bye, Clarence.

23:10.699 --> 23:11.735
Bye, Mister Jefferson.

23:11.873 --> 23:13.115
Bye, Mrs. Jefferson.

23:16.843 --> 23:17.913
Oh...

23:19.328 --> 23:22.021
Florence, thank you
so much for that tip.

23:22.159 --> 23:25.473
I guess this bunny
really played that
old alligator, huh?

23:25.611 --> 23:28.407
Works every time.
Yeah. Oh,
one more thing.

23:28.545 --> 23:30.616
You never did tell me,
whatever happened
to that bunny

23:30.754 --> 23:32.100
when he got to
the other side
of the river?

23:32.238 --> 23:33.722
Oh, the alligator ate him.

23:36.345 --> 23:37.657
Yeah.

23:40.039 --> 23:43.387
Oh, George,
I'm so proud of you.

23:43.525 --> 23:46.321
You've just hired your
first general manager.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.943
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

23:48.081 --> 23:50.601
From now on,
he'll talk to the suppliers.

23:50.739 --> 23:52.361
He'll deal with
the accountants.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.329
He'll handle
the employees.

23:54.778 --> 23:55.779
What'll I do?

23:55.917 --> 23:57.884
Anything you want.

23:58.022 --> 24:00.059
Just think of
all that free time.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.268
Yeah. Free time.

24:02.406 --> 24:04.926
And your days
will be your own.

24:05.789 --> 24:06.962
Free time...

24:07.100 --> 24:08.343
Hey, Weezy,
you know something?

24:08.481 --> 24:11.277
This just might be
the greatest idea
you ever had.

24:11.415 --> 24:13.590
Oh, do you really
think so, George?

24:13.728 --> 24:16.213
Yeah, 'cause while Clarence
is out there doing
all my dirty work,

24:16.351 --> 24:18.629
I could spend my time
doing some more
important things.

24:19.285 --> 24:21.218
Like what, George?

24:21.356 --> 24:22.771
Like opening up
some new stores.

24:24.601 --> 24:26.223
Just kidding, Weezy.
I'm just kidding.

24:48.210 --> 24:49.936
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was recorded on tape

24:50.074 --> 24:52.042
in front of
a studio audience.
