00:37.538 --> 00:39.471
Perfect.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.321
What do you think?
Nice, right?

00:55.322 --> 00:58.757
It's... okay.

01:06.434 --> 01:12.105
No, hold it, it will soon
be yours.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.574
Four million Naira.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.676
Three-four.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.479
My friend, that is too low.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.847
Three-five.

01:20.848 --> 01:24.651
Okay, three-nine, because
I like you.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.619
Three-six, that's my final
offer.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.254
Come now, work with me!

01:28.255 --> 01:30.824
My friend bought a car just like
this for three-five.

01:30.825 --> 01:33.860
No, the mileage on this car and
that car are not the same.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.662
See the odometer.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.798
No one would sell a car like
this for three-five, no one!

01:38.799 --> 01:40.700
Three-six is what I want to pay.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.468
Three-seven.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.806
What is holding you?

01:46.807 --> 01:48.708
I need more time to think
about it.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.511
Think about what? You're not
going to find a better car...

01:51.512 --> 01:54.180
than this, not for three point
seven million, not in Lagos!

01:54.181 --> 01:55.582
I'll give you my answer
tomorrow.

01:55.583 --> 01:58.118
You're not the only
one eyeing this car.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.486
Four others are seeing it
tonight!

01:59.487 --> 02:02.555
By tomorrow it will not be here,
I promise you.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.256
We'll see.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.698
Where are you going, my friend?

02:19.607 --> 02:21.807
Are we good?
Yes.

02:26.514 --> 02:30.249
Date, sign, print your name,
sign it, date.

02:51.205 --> 02:54.373
You see, I told you
it would be yours!

03:02.883 --> 03:05.485
Oh, where is the spare key?

03:05.486 --> 03:07.686
It's in the glove compartment.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.750
How far?
Just drive!

03:37.751 --> 03:39.686
How much did we make?
Drive!

03:56.337 --> 03:57.703
Next!

03:59.440 --> 04:01.374
What's the purpose
of your visit?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.008
Visiting family.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.250
We need that baggage quick,
please.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.718
<i>Baggage claim?</i>
Yeah.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.786
<i>Okay, coming.</i>
Okay.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.555
Excuse me... where do I pick up
my luggage?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.790
Uh, can I see your ticket?
Yeah.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.766
Your luggage will arrive at the
one behind me, okay?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.368
Thank you.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.536
Once you pick up your luggage,
go to customs.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.338
They already stamped
my passport.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.873
Customs must also clear
your luggage...

04:33.874 --> 04:35.308
before you can leave the
airport.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.377
Appreciate it, thank you.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.279
Also make sure you give them
a little something...

04:39.280 --> 04:40.680
unless they will delay you.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.914
Something like what?

04:41.915 --> 04:46.419
Something.
You mean money.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.588
Of course.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.589
Is that legal?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.526
This is not America.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.064
Is $10 okay?

04:58.065 --> 05:00.600
They usually take $20.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.467
We'll they have change?

05:04.705 --> 05:07.540
It's okay, don't worry, I'll
tell them to settle for $10.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.342
Okay.

05:09.343 --> 05:12.311
I could give it to them, so you
don't have to wait in line.

05:18.585 --> 05:22.555
Go to baggage claim, once you're
done from there, I'll meet you.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.855
Thank you.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.802
You have to unlock your phone
before you can use it.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.105
Thanks.

05:43.010 --> 05:46.379
Is this your first time here?
Yeah.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.748
American?
Yeah.

05:48.749 --> 05:52.985
Nigerian-American?
Yeah, where you from?

05:52.986 --> 05:54.821
Australia.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.824
What are you doing here?
Business.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.826
How about you? You visiting
family?

05:59.827 --> 06:02.694
Nah, my mom just wants me out
the house for the summer.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.034
How long are you here for?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.136
Four weeks.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.438
Well, you're lucky!

06:12.439 --> 06:14.374
Not a lot of people have the
opportunity to travel...

06:14.375 --> 06:17.576
especially at your age...
I didn't.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.815
What's your name?

06:22.816 --> 06:26.018
Eze, but people call me Eazy.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.054
Wallace.
Nice to meet you.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.022
Take care of yourself, mate.
You, too.

06:30.023 --> 06:34.627
Hey, I know a guy that can get
you through customs, quick!

06:34.628 --> 06:36.095
And he's cheap.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.064
Sorry, I'm not following you.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.632
You have to pay customs
on your way out...

06:39.633 --> 06:41.133
so they won't keep you waiting.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.509
Did you give somebody
your money?

06:49.510 --> 06:51.042
Yeah.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.481
Who told you that?

06:55.482 --> 06:56.849
Don't worry about it,
it's just ten bucks.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.418
No, it's okay, just point
him out.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.991
All right, wait here.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.591
Sorry, excuse me.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.895
What did you say to him?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.464
I told him I work for the UN.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.865
You work for the UN?

07:45.866 --> 07:50.470
No, but I'm the only white man
here...

07:50.471 --> 07:52.170
so he has to think I'm of some
importance.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.643
I'll wait for you.
Appreciate it.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.548
So what do you do?

08:02.549 --> 08:05.551
I used to work as an accountant,
now I handle trust funds.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.220
There is a lot of cheap money
in Nigeria.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.654
It's a great place to do
business...

08:08.655 --> 08:10.089
if you know how to play
the game.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.524
That's my driver.

08:14.595 --> 08:18.865
Here's my card. If you have
questions, call me.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.066
Appreciate it.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.967
Have a good night, mate.
You, too.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.041
Eze!

08:34.681 --> 08:36.182
Hello.

08:36.183 --> 08:42.087
Aw... let's go.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.967
How long was your flight?
12 hours.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.536
You must be tired.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.060
You look so much like your
mother.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.895
Everyone says that.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.963
My son looks nothing like me.

09:38.245 --> 09:42.982
It's okay, it comes off and on.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.318
The electricity?

09:45.319 --> 09:47.652
Yes, it's normal.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.691
Where's my room?

09:51.692 --> 09:55.026
Here, take a lantern, follow me.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.286
Where are you sleeping?

10:20.287 --> 10:23.289
We're sharing the bed?
Yes.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.924
Can you call my mom?

10:42.809 --> 10:44.376
It's ringing.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.157
Is he there?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.660
Yeah.
<i>Eze?</i>

11:00.661 --> 11:03.062
Hey, Mom.
Oh, thank God!

11:03.063 --> 11:04.363
When did you land?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.698
Ah... two hours ago.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.767
And you're just now calling me?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.235
The phone you gave me
isn't working!

11:09.236 --> 11:10.436
It needs to be unlocked.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.271
Where are you?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.739
<i>Grace's apartment.</i>

11:13.740 --> 11:16.709
Auntie Grace's apartment.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.879
Auntie Grace's apartment only
has one bed?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.747
You didn't tell me that!

11:21.748 --> 11:26.385
<i>She doesn't bite.</i>

11:26.386 --> 11:28.220
And there is no electricity.

11:28.221 --> 11:31.257
That's Nigeria for you!

11:31.258 --> 11:33.459
Why don't they just leave
the power on?

11:33.460 --> 11:37.429
Because some people very high up
won't allow that.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.766
Auntie Grace is a lawyer?!

11:40.767 --> 11:42.068
<i>I told you what she does!</i>

11:42.069 --> 11:43.703
I forgot!

11:43.704 --> 11:45.337
<i>She's a professor.</i>

11:45.338 --> 11:47.740
How old is her son?

11:47.741 --> 11:51.143
<i>That's a good
question... I don't know.</i>

11:51.144 --> 11:52.978
You said his dad is dead, right?

11:52.979 --> 11:54.747
<i>Yeah, a long time ago.</i>

11:54.748 --> 11:57.248
How did he die?
<i>Sickle-cell.</i>

12:02.122 --> 12:04.824
Hey, Mom, so how does Auntie
Grace use the internet...

12:04.825 --> 12:06.859
when the power is off?

12:06.860 --> 12:11.196
She doesn't, in fact, I don't
even think she has internet.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.269
Mom... why am I doing here?

12:17.270 --> 12:18.904
<i>We talked about this.</i>

12:18.905 --> 12:21.273
I don't want to stay here
for four weeks.

12:21.274 --> 12:26.245
You're there to learn who you
are and where you're from.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.081
<i>Give it time, eh?</i>

12:29.082 --> 12:32.083
Can I just stay for two weeks
instead?

12:34.221 --> 12:37.422
Mom? Hello?

12:49.269 --> 12:51.837
<i>Dearest one...</i>

12:51.838 --> 12:55.508
<i>with due respect and humanity,
I am compelled to write...</i>

12:55.509 --> 12:59.445
<i>to you under a humanitarian
ground.</i>

12:59.446 --> 13:03.282
<i>My husband is the late
Mr. John Papamichael...</i>

13:03.283 --> 13:08.854
<i>founder of J.P. Industries,
Cote D'ivoire, West Africa.</i>

13:08.855 --> 13:12.825
<i>Before passing last year, my
husband left me...</i>

13:12.826 --> 13:16.796
<i>with an inheritance of ten
million U.S. dollars.</i>

13:16.797 --> 13:20.933
<i>Unfortunately, shortly after
receiving my inheritance...</i>

13:20.934 --> 13:24.370
<i>my doctor revealed to me
that I will not last...</i>

13:24.371 --> 13:27.840
<i>the next six months due
to liver cancer.</i>

13:27.841 --> 13:31.343
<i>Having come to terms with my
condition...</i>

13:31.344 --> 13:34.847
<i>I have decided to donate the
money to a kind-hearted...</i>

13:34.848 --> 13:38.117
<i>God-fearing individual, who
will utilize the fund...</i>

13:38.118 --> 13:43.455
<i>to help the less privileged and
to propagate the word of God.</i>

13:43.456 --> 13:47.326
<i>Seeing as I do not have any
children or next of kin...</i>

13:47.327 --> 13:50.563
<i>to inherit my fortune, I feel
comfortable...</i>

13:50.564 --> 13:53.599
<i>making the decision to release
my money to you.</i>

13:53.600 --> 13:55.935
<i>Hope to hear from you soon.</i>

13:55.936 --> 14:00.271
<i>God Bless, Mrs. Angeliki
Papamichael.</i>

14:21.595 --> 14:23.863
I'm going to the market,
are you coming?

14:23.864 --> 14:25.331
No!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.265
Are you jet-lagged?

14:29.102 --> 14:31.203
Your breakfast is ready
in the living room.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.039
Eat it there. I don't want
crumbs in my bed.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.107
Mm-hm.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.064
What are you here to do?
Where are you come from?

16:39.065 --> 16:40.732
I don't know what you're saying!

17:00.086 --> 17:04.022
Sorry, my mother does not
usually have guests...

17:04.023 --> 17:06.223
over when she is away.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.564
Can we keep what happened to
your laptop between us?

17:12.565 --> 17:17.603
Do not worry, I will buy you a
newer and better one, I promise.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.305
My name is Pius.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.040
Can you hand me the remote?

18:53.299 --> 18:54.799
Sit.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.243
Do you know why I brought
you here?

19:04.244 --> 19:06.178
No, sir.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.847
I brought you here to tell you
that this, your scamming...

19:08.848 --> 19:12.751
thing that you're doing, it's
not the right business for you.

19:12.752 --> 19:19.291
You're far too stupid to make
any money from such a business.

19:19.292 --> 19:24.563
Don't look at him!
I am the one talking.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.564
Don't I protect you?

19:28.168 --> 19:31.370
Answer!
Yes, sir!

19:31.371 --> 19:33.939
Then why is it that you don't
want to include me...

19:33.940 --> 19:35.707
in this, your thing?

19:35.708 --> 19:38.310
Sir, which thing is this?

19:38.311 --> 19:40.546
Do you think that Indian man
will not be able to recognize...

19:40.547 --> 19:42.848
you, if I put you in a line up?

19:42.849 --> 19:45.918
He does not only want me
to lock you up...

19:45.919 --> 19:48.320
he wants me to chop off
your head.

19:48.321 --> 19:53.725
And he has given me money to
make sure that it happens.

19:53.726 --> 19:57.428
And it will happen!

19:59.699 --> 20:05.337
Please, sir, forgive me, it will
never happen again.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.372
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I made
a mistake.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.274
Take him.

20:09.275 --> 20:13.679
Sir! Sir... I will pay you back
all of it now! With interest!

20:13.680 --> 20:16.281
Wait!

20:16.282 --> 20:19.585
I want four million.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.320
Okay.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.655
In five days.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.960
Sir... five days is not enough
time. Five days... wait!

20:27.961 --> 20:31.762
Wait, wait! Okay, four million
in five days!

20:54.554 --> 20:56.922
Why are you in the dark?

20:56.923 --> 21:00.292
The batteries in the lantern
are dead.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.594
Use the kerosene lantern.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.495
I don't know how.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.873
Pick up the matches!

21:21.714 --> 21:22.814
Pull this handle.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.883
This one?
Yes, that one.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.886
Strike the match.

21:31.324 --> 21:32.723
Put it there.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.028
Pull back the handle.

21:40.700 --> 21:43.601
That's it?
That's it.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.906
Have you had a bath?

21:47.907 --> 21:49.807
You don't have a shower.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.011
Follow me.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.952
Don't forget
to bring the lantern!

22:14.667 --> 22:17.335
You want me to bathe you, too?

22:30.016 --> 22:31.649
What happened to your computer?

22:33.820 --> 22:35.087
Why are you going through
my things?

22:35.088 --> 22:37.088
Did my son do this?

22:39.692 --> 22:40.859
He will pay for this.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.794
It wasn't him!

22:42.795 --> 22:45.997
Then how did it happen?

22:45.998 --> 22:48.900
The lights cut off and I
couldn't see where I was going.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.903
Are you telling me you knocked
it over?

22:51.904 --> 22:53.604
Yes.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.128
Get dressed, we're going out.

23:16.129 --> 23:17.495
I'm good.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.433
Don't test me!

23:37.784 --> 23:39.084
What's your problem?

23:39.085 --> 23:41.553
I'm not your mother, you hear
me?

23:41.554 --> 23:44.121
The next time, it will be
boiling water.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.006
Why don't you like coming
outside? It's a beautiful day.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.874
I like jerking off too much.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.009
What does that mean?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.811
It means watching TV.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.045
Yes, it's true, you jerk off
too much.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.449
Where are we going?

24:10.450 --> 24:12.451
Don't worry, you'll like it.

25:27.226 --> 25:30.762
How much longer? I'm beginning
to feel hungry.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.564
We just got here.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.600
We have been here a whole
two hours!

25:35.601 --> 25:37.768
Well, these computers are slow!

25:41.941 --> 25:43.775
Is this why we are still here?

25:43.776 --> 25:47.078
I didn't ask to come.

25:47.079 --> 25:50.615
Mm... if you don't like it,
we can leave!

25:50.616 --> 25:52.017
Are you always like this?

25:52.018 --> 25:54.285
Always like what?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.591
You may think I'm strict...

25:59.592 --> 26:03.194
but I've seen what happens to a
child when a parent is lenient.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.996
I'm not your son.

26:04.997 --> 26:10.135
I know, but both of you
are the same... very stubborn.

26:10.136 --> 26:13.337
I'm sure you saw that in him
when you met him yesterday.

26:15.107 --> 26:16.608
How do you know we met?

26:16.609 --> 26:18.643
Because he has my spare key.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.812
He sneaks into the house from
time to time for food.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.150
He didn't seem stubborn.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.017
Well, trust me, he is.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.623
So what does he do for work?

26:31.624 --> 26:34.092
He's an email scammer.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.828
But he can scam you in other
ways, though.

26:36.829 --> 26:39.030
That's why I was asking
if he broke your laptop.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.733
Because he can take advantage
of that and scam you, too.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.734
You understand?

26:46.672 --> 26:49.007
So does your son ever
come here to scam?

26:49.008 --> 26:54.812
Here? Nah, their computer
is too slow for him.

27:11.664 --> 27:14.032
What is wrong with you?
This is disgusting!

27:14.033 --> 27:15.667
It is good food.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.102
You think this is good food?!

27:17.103 --> 27:20.138
What do you call good food,
American food, eh?

27:20.139 --> 27:23.174
This is Nigeria, this is
Nigerian food.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.711
I'm not Nigerian, I'm American.

27:26.712 --> 27:32.884
Both your parents are Nigerian,
from Igbo state... Igboland!

27:32.885 --> 27:34.986
Nigerian blood flows through
your veins.

27:34.987 --> 27:39.891
You can't change that,
so stop trying.

27:39.892 --> 27:43.094
I don't want to eat this,
can I order something else?

27:43.095 --> 27:45.062
You must finish it!

27:47.833 --> 27:49.901
I can't wait till this is over.

27:49.902 --> 27:54.805
Better get ready, this is just
the beginning.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.144
What do you mean, it's just
the beginning?

27:59.145 --> 28:01.246
Hm?

28:01.247 --> 28:02.981
What did you mean by that?

28:02.982 --> 28:05.383
Nothing.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.185
Let me use your phone,
I want to call my mom.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.887
Can't you see I'm eating?

28:08.888 --> 28:10.921
Can I please use your phone?!

28:30.443 --> 28:31.910
Hello?

28:31.911 --> 28:33.044
<i>Mom!</i>

28:33.045 --> 28:34.179
Hi, honey.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.114
I have a question.

28:36.115 --> 28:39.184
I'm only staying here
for four weeks, right?

28:39.185 --> 28:41.386
Why are you asking?

28:41.387 --> 28:43.487
Mom, just tell me the truth.

28:49.462 --> 28:51.328
No.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.495
Get out of my way!
Where are you going?

29:23.496 --> 29:24.929
Move!

29:24.930 --> 29:26.331
You think you want to go home,
how?

29:26.332 --> 29:27.499
Can you move?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.000
I'll move if you tell me how.

29:29.001 --> 29:31.202
I'm going to the airport!
To do what?

29:31.203 --> 29:32.504
To upgrade my return flight.

29:32.505 --> 29:35.038
Your mother canceled it
the day you arrived.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.209
I want to call my mom.

29:38.210 --> 29:43.013
You can call her tomorrow.
I'm tired.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.336
Is Henry here?
Yes.

30:13.212 --> 30:16.414
Henry, why did you give me
a duplicate...

30:16.415 --> 30:18.817
when I asked you for an
original?

30:18.818 --> 30:23.254
Originals are traceable,
duplicates are not.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.390
But duplicates are twice
the cost.

30:29.261 --> 30:32.297
Give me back my money!

30:32.298 --> 30:35.032
I will deduct it
from your next job.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.403
Whose job is this?

30:38.404 --> 30:40.271
None of your business.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.272
You never told me you could
make black money.

30:47.913 --> 30:51.983
This is very good work,
who is the Mugu?

30:51.984 --> 30:53.418
Why are you here?

30:53.419 --> 30:56.054
I need you to call Baba.
Why?

30:56.055 --> 30:57.355
I need you to locate him for me.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.057
Locate him yourself.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.058
He's not answering my calls.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.229
Because of Smart?

31:08.400 --> 31:11.870
Word travels fast.

31:11.871 --> 31:15.172
Well, the faster you make this
call, the faster I leave.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.308
Hello.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.177
Hello, Mercy, your son says
he wants to speak to you.

31:53.178 --> 31:55.146
<i>Tell him I'll call him later.</i>

31:55.147 --> 31:56.380
He says it's an emergency.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.918
Fine.
Hold on.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.655
Mom.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.924
Honey, are you okay?

32:05.925 --> 32:07.592
I want to come home.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.361
I was told this was an
emergency.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.163
You lied to me!

32:12.164 --> 32:13.498
<i>Would you
have gone otherwise?</i>

32:13.499 --> 32:15.633
That's not the point!

32:15.634 --> 32:19.404
It's just for a year. When you
graduate, you can come back.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.239
Is this because of that fight?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.607
Like I said before...

32:22.608 --> 32:24.575
Oh my god, I know who I am and
where I'm from!

32:24.576 --> 32:27.946
Then why are you afraid to call
yourself Nigerian, eh?

32:27.947 --> 32:30.982
Alright, you win, I'm Nigerian!

32:30.983 --> 32:33.217
Now can I please come home?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.219
<i>I have to be
at work in four hours.</i>

32:35.220 --> 32:37.354
<i>Let's talk about this later.</i>

32:40.125 --> 32:43.060
If you're dialing America,
add one to the numbers.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.167
<i>You have reached...</i>

32:49.168 --> 32:52.103
<i>the voice mailbox of...
Kingsley Okocha.</i>

32:52.104 --> 32:54.439
<i>Please record your voice
message.</i>

32:54.440 --> 32:59.010
Dad, give me a call when you get
this message.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.011
It's an emergency.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.681
Are you done?

33:07.453 --> 33:10.755
Instead of looking for ways
to leave, why not stop...

33:10.756 --> 33:12.457
and think of why your mother
sent you here.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.626
You think she came up with this
idea overnight? No.

33:15.627 --> 33:19.397
She's been planning this
day since... since!

33:19.398 --> 33:21.399
You're here because she wants
you here.

33:21.400 --> 33:25.303
The earlier you get that into
your head, the better for you.

33:25.304 --> 33:28.139
Take your food, eat, get
dressed.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.741
We have a very busy day ahead.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.213
Where are we going?

33:35.214 --> 33:38.115
To your new school.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.774
We are partners.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.709
I have a new partner.
Oh, this clown?

34:04.710 --> 34:06.376
Why are you calling me a clown?

34:09.547 --> 34:10.748
Just get into the car.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.550
Get inside now!

34:15.521 --> 34:17.422
I cannot help you!

34:17.422 --> 34:19.743
You know the type of trouble
I'm in now. I need money fast!

34:27.132 --> 34:28.799
Don't follow me.

34:34.373 --> 34:35.733
At least tell me what
you're doing?

34:38.310 --> 34:39.810
Come now, who's the Mugu?

34:42.815 --> 34:45.083
The Ikotun Irepodun Market.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.217
You're selling all this at the
market?

34:47.219 --> 34:48.453
How much are you selling it for?

34:48.454 --> 34:49.654
Half-off.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.355
How much did you buy the rice
for?

34:51.356 --> 34:52.956
Full price.

34:52.956 --> 34:54.559
You bought this rice full price,
but you're selling it half-off?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.194
Have you gone mad?

34:56.195 --> 34:57.461
How will you profit?

35:00.466 --> 35:02.133
After all of this rice
is sold...

35:02.134 --> 35:04.168
there will be people,
lots of people...

35:04.169 --> 35:05.837
who wanted rice but didn't get.

35:05.838 --> 35:09.240
It's not everyday that one finds
a deal like this in Lagos.

35:09.241 --> 35:11.609
Those who missed out will
jump...

35:11.610 --> 35:13.777
at the next opportunity to buy
that rice.

35:17.249 --> 35:20.184
This is that opportunity.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.887
I will take pre-orders from
those who missed out.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.423
Give them this ticket to claim
their rice from four...

35:25.424 --> 35:30.561
additional trucks that will
arrive shortly after I leave.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.897
So, what's the scam?

35:32.898 --> 35:36.366
Do you see any additional
trucks here?

35:38.437 --> 35:42.306
You know I can help you sell
this rice fast, add me!

35:42.307 --> 35:43.641
My friend, my friend...
Wait!

35:43.642 --> 35:45.276
How much did he put
in for the rice?

35:45.277 --> 35:46.677
Why?

35:46.678 --> 35:48.246
I'll cover the entire cost
of the rice...

35:48.247 --> 35:49.713
and we can share the profits
50/50.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.816
Okay, 60/40!

35:58.157 --> 35:59.322
Get in.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.896
It's nothing personal, this is
just business. Now get out!

36:08.634 --> 36:10.600
I said get out!

36:54.813 --> 36:58.382
Stay here, don't say a word
to anybody.

36:58.383 --> 36:59.984
Once they hear your accent...

36:59.985 --> 37:01.953
the money for your admission
will increase.

37:01.954 --> 37:03.521
I thought this school was free?

37:03.522 --> 37:08.992
Nothing is free in this country,
so ssh, stay, mm?

37:16.802 --> 37:18.468
Yes?

37:58.310 --> 37:59.809
It is not his money!

38:03.382 --> 38:05.016
You should run, this is
not a joke.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.951
He doesn't want me dead,
he just wants money.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.887
I am too valuable for him
to kill.

38:09.888 --> 38:12.923
Oh, so that's your young friend
who's chained in his office...

38:12.924 --> 38:15.526
is he valuable too?

38:15.527 --> 38:17.460
Just tell me what we are
doing next?

38:24.036 --> 38:27.338
You're doing a 'Wash-Wash'.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.806
I know that scam very well,
you know that!

38:31.977 --> 38:33.644
I can handle this myself.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.546
How much more of that black
money do you need?

38:35.547 --> 38:37.048
Why?

38:37.049 --> 38:39.850
Because I can give you 10,000
more black bills...

38:39.851 --> 38:42.853
to help make your scam look
more convincing.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.455
You have that much?

38:44.456 --> 38:46.690
Yes, from an old scam.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.761
Ten thousand!

38:50.762 --> 38:53.531
Not eight, not nine, 10,000!

38:53.532 --> 38:56.833
Okay! Now tell me your scam.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.980
<i>Dear friend, I am
an Accounting Manager...</i>

39:09.981 --> 39:11.916
<i>at the Nigerian Development
Bank.</i>

39:11.917 --> 39:13.617
<i>I want my bank to release...</i>

39:13.618 --> 39:17.355
<i>three million dollars worth
of black money to you.</i>

39:17.356 --> 39:19.857
<i>What is black money,
you may be asking?</i>

39:19.858 --> 39:23.027
<i>Black money is genuine money
that has been coated...</i>

39:23.028 --> 39:26.097
<i>with a special black substance
to give it the appearance...</i>

39:26.098 --> 39:29.066
<i>and texture of black
construction paper.</i>

39:29.067 --> 39:31.902
<i>By doing this, one can
transport a large sum...</i>

39:31.903 --> 39:35.606
<i>of money in plain sight
anywhere around the globe.</i>

39:35.607 --> 39:38.642
<i>In order to return black money
to its original state...</i>

39:38.643 --> 39:42.713
<i>one simply needs to wash the
money in a chemical bath.</i>

39:42.714 --> 39:45.483
<i>After the black money is
released, I would like...</i>

39:45.484 --> 39:47.918
<i>for you to make a brief visit
to Nigeria to be convinced...</i>

39:47.919 --> 39:51.422
<i>that it is indeed genuine
U.S. currency.</i>

39:51.423 --> 39:54.058
<i>If you are satisfied with its
genuineness, together we...</i>

39:54.059 --> 39:56.494
<i>will purchase the rest of the
chemicals needed to wash...</i>

39:56.495 --> 39:59.430
<i>three million dollars worth
of black money.</i>

39:59.431 --> 40:02.600
<i>And also note that you will
have 40 percent...</i>

40:02.601 --> 40:05.169
<i>of the above-mentioned sum if
you agree to handle this...</i>

40:05.170 --> 40:07.738
<i>business with me. I am
expecting your urgent...</i>

40:07.739 --> 40:10.408
<i>response as soon as you receive
my message.</i>

40:10.409 --> 40:13.576
<i>Best Regard, Mr. Edgar Adu.</i>

40:16.782 --> 40:19.517
Who's the Mugu?
Bob Matthews.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.685
An American?
Yeah.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.120
Is he here in Lagos?

40:23.121 --> 40:25.156
Yes, he arrived last night.

40:25.157 --> 40:26.891
What does he do?

40:26.892 --> 40:31.061
HVAC... heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.430
He's a repair man?

40:32.431 --> 40:37.834
No! He's a small business owner!

40:39.671 --> 40:42.006
I'm telling you, this man
is loaded!

40:42.007 --> 40:44.108
His company services homes,
businesses...

40:44.109 --> 40:46.209
hospitals, you name it.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.613
How much can we get from him?

40:49.614 --> 40:52.550
A least $5,000, easy!

40:52.551 --> 40:56.587
How are we splitting this?
70/30. Non-negotiable!

40:56.588 --> 40:59.123
That's too small!

40:59.124 --> 41:01.124
You're not the only one
who needs money.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.662
When are we doing it?

41:04.663 --> 41:09.166
In two days.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.035
When's Smart's money due?

41:11.036 --> 41:13.704
In three days.
Then you'll be fine!

41:13.705 --> 41:17.508
7:00 a.m. outside at the Palm Hotel...

41:17.509 --> 41:20.043
and don't forget to bring
the ten thousand!

41:24.716 --> 41:26.049
And Pius!

41:27.686 --> 41:31.221
Please look the part.

43:18.863 --> 43:20.597
What was that?

43:27.005 --> 43:29.005
He told me not to tell you.

43:45.156 --> 43:46.823
Yes.

43:53.064 --> 43:57.635
Okay, but can I use your
phone first?

43:57.636 --> 43:59.803
You want to call your mother?

43:59.804 --> 44:00.938
Yes.

44:00.939 --> 44:02.739
Okay.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.306
Hello?

45:19.751 --> 45:22.419
Hey, who's that?

45:22.420 --> 45:24.088
That's Bimbo, my neighbor's
daughter.

45:24.089 --> 45:25.989
She's taking you to school.

45:25.990 --> 45:28.459
Tuck in your shirt!

45:28.460 --> 45:30.194
So, you're not taking me
to school?

45:30.195 --> 45:33.396
No, I am going to work, now go,
you'll be late.

45:35.500 --> 45:37.968
Is her name really Bimbo?

45:37.969 --> 45:40.470
Yes... go!

45:47.078 --> 45:48.746
Can I ask you a question?

45:48.747 --> 45:49.980
Yeah, what's up?

45:49.981 --> 45:53.250
Why are you schooling
in Nigeria?

45:53.251 --> 45:55.385
My mom says I'm here because I
don't know who I am...

45:55.386 --> 45:59.289
but I'm really here, cause I got
into a fight at school.

45:59.290 --> 46:02.025
So you were sent to my school
as punishment?

46:02.026 --> 46:04.461
Exactly!

46:04.462 --> 46:08.232
Are you making a joke?!
No!

46:08.233 --> 46:11.235
My school is one of the best
schools in Nigeria.

46:11.236 --> 46:14.036
You're not American, you
wouldn't understand.

46:18.510 --> 46:20.410
Why do people call you Bimbo?

46:20.411 --> 46:22.546
Bimbo is short for Abimbola.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.548
It means, born wealthy, in
Yoruba.

46:24.549 --> 46:27.985
Do you know what "bimbo" means
in America?

46:27.986 --> 46:30.087
I don't care!
Why not?

46:30.088 --> 46:32.990
I'm not American, I won't
understand.

46:32.991 --> 46:35.124
I-I'm sorry!

46:39.063 --> 46:42.366
So, is walking with me to school
part of your punishment?

46:42.367 --> 46:44.368
Yeah, it's the worst part.

46:44.369 --> 46:47.938
This is the first day, why is
your bag so heavy?

46:47.939 --> 46:49.138
Eze!

46:52.844 --> 46:53.924
It was nice talking to you.

46:58.149 --> 46:59.599
Where are you going?

46:59.600 --> 47:01.051
Wait, wait, wait, just, just,
just turn around.

47:01.052 --> 47:03.886
Come now, turn around!

47:06.558 --> 47:07.990
Can we go now?

47:09.928 --> 47:12.161
Oh, you look beautiful.

48:09.153 --> 48:12.356
I was surprised you called me
last night.

48:12.357 --> 48:15.224
I take it my mother does not
know you're with me?

48:17.095 --> 48:18.629
So, what do you do for a living?

48:18.630 --> 48:21.331
I think you know what I do.

48:21.332 --> 48:23.033
You're a Nigerian scammer?

48:23.034 --> 48:25.535
You can just say scammer.

48:25.536 --> 48:27.471
What made you want to become
a scammer?

48:27.472 --> 48:29.673
When I was in school,
I needed money.

48:29.674 --> 48:33.343
How long have you been doing it?
12 years.

48:33.344 --> 48:36.680
12 years... are you ever
gonna stop?

48:36.681 --> 48:39.549
You think what I'm doing is bad,
am I right?

48:39.550 --> 48:41.451
You don't think it's bad?

48:41.452 --> 48:44.621
I'll be honest with you, I know
it's bad, but I do not care.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.324
The people I scam, they're just
as bad as me.

48:47.325 --> 48:49.326
They think they can make money
without working for it.

48:49.327 --> 48:50.427
They're fools.

48:50.428 --> 48:52.496
Did you ever scam your mom?

48:52.497 --> 48:55.632
No, not intentionally...

48:55.633 --> 48:58.035
but that's not what she thinks.

48:58.036 --> 49:00.003
So, is that why she doesn't want
you around me?

49:00.004 --> 49:03.307
No, my mother doesn't want us
together...

49:03.308 --> 49:07.311
because I am not at the top
of my chosen profession.

49:07.312 --> 49:09.413
What?!

49:09.414 --> 49:12.416
You see that man?
Nobody wants to be him.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.419
No child grows up and says
I want to be the man...

49:15.420 --> 49:18.021
who pushes the wheelbarrow.

49:18.022 --> 49:20.390
But if that man starts making
money...

49:20.391 --> 49:22.459
everyone will be pushing
wheelbarrows.

49:22.460 --> 49:26.396
To the average Nigerian, only
thing that matters is money.

49:26.397 --> 49:29.232
Money, money, money, money!

49:29.233 --> 49:30.734
I do what I do so I can
make money.

49:30.735 --> 49:32.336
So scammers really make money?

49:32.337 --> 49:35.072
Of course! 419 is big business.

49:35.073 --> 49:36.506
419?

49:36.507 --> 49:38.608
419 is the Nigerian criminal
code for scammers.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.444
You understand?

49:40.445 --> 49:42.179
And here scammers don't call
themselves scammers, no...

49:42.180 --> 49:46.116
we call ourselves Niners
Yahoo-boys, G-boys!

49:46.117 --> 49:48.018
Why G-boys?

49:48.019 --> 49:51.555
Like game boy... because
scamming is a game.

49:51.556 --> 49:54.458
So people really fall for these
email scams?

49:54.459 --> 49:58.228
Ask yourself this, do you think
those who scam would waste...

49:58.229 --> 49:59.563
their time sending you those
emails...

49:59.564 --> 50:01.098
if they were not making
a profit?

50:01.099 --> 50:02.632
Maybe.

50:02.633 --> 50:05.535
Most people think it's only the
old who fall for scams.

50:05.536 --> 50:11.140
It's not true, anyone can fall
victim! Anyone!

50:28.593 --> 50:30.559
Jack Daniels, neat!

50:35.400 --> 50:36.767
What do you want?

50:36.768 --> 50:39.569
I'll have what you're having.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.070
Two, eh?

50:56.087 --> 50:57.386
Whassup!

51:18.476 --> 51:21.144
You like what you see?

51:21.145 --> 51:22.379
You come here a lot?

51:22.380 --> 51:26.116
No, my life is not that
interesting.

51:26.117 --> 51:28.185
It's more interesting
than mine.

51:28.186 --> 51:30.387
There's nothing for me
to do here.

51:30.388 --> 51:33.190
What do you normally do for fun?

51:33.191 --> 51:38.161
Watch movies, go skating, just
kick it with friends, you know?

51:38.162 --> 51:40.763
You can do that here.

51:48.806 --> 51:53.342
So, if you needed money badly...

51:54.512 --> 51:56.712
would your mom send it?

51:58.282 --> 52:00.149
How much do you need?

52:02.487 --> 52:04.354
$5,000.

52:04.355 --> 52:07.557
My mom would never send me
that much money.

52:07.558 --> 52:09.825
It's okay.

52:13.698 --> 52:17.434
If you need money,
I can help you scam.

52:17.435 --> 52:20.904
I'm going to bring you water,
if you continue talking rubbish.

52:20.905 --> 52:23.206
I know things about
America that could help you...

52:23.207 --> 52:26.376
and all I want in return
is a plane ticket home.

52:26.377 --> 52:28.578
You keep the rest.

52:28.579 --> 52:30.881
Your mother brought you
here with her own money.

52:30.882 --> 52:33.350
If you return, she will
not welcome you!

52:33.351 --> 52:37.220
I'm not staying with my
mom, I'm staying at my dad's.

52:37.221 --> 52:38.722
They're divorced?

52:38.723 --> 52:40.290
Separated.

52:40.291 --> 52:42.292
You should confirm with your
father first.

52:42.293 --> 52:48.231
I did! He knows, I talked to
him. I did!

52:48.232 --> 52:49.532
He's okay with it!

52:53.871 --> 52:55.404
So, what do you think?

52:58.342 --> 53:00.509
I'll think about it.

53:33.244 --> 53:34.778
What time is it?

53:34.779 --> 53:37.414
It's 6:00 o'clock.

53:37.415 --> 53:39.249
Why are you all dressed up?

53:39.250 --> 53:42.586
I'm going out. I'll be back
in a few hours, okay?

53:42.587 --> 53:45.888
There is food... somewhere.

54:20.491 --> 54:22.325
I said look the part!

54:22.326 --> 54:24.628
You're supposed to be a
chemist, not a village chief!

54:24.629 --> 54:27.664
I want to impress him now.

54:27.665 --> 54:29.633
How much is here?

54:29.634 --> 54:31.301
I thought I had more.

54:31.302 --> 54:34.938
You see why I don't like
to work with you?

54:34.939 --> 54:36.906
You promised me 10,000!

54:36.907 --> 54:40.576
Don't worry, it's enough!
What do you have for me?

54:53.624 --> 54:55.959
Everything is in there.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.728
He pays the money, and you can
fit all these chemicals...

54:58.729 --> 55:00.430
inside this canvas bag.

55:00.431 --> 55:03.399
What will I use for the test?

55:17.882 --> 55:19.783
You don't know me, I've done
this before.

55:27.024 --> 55:28.692
Hi.

55:28.693 --> 55:31.461
I thought it was just
going to be me and you.

55:31.462 --> 55:34.663
It's okay, he's a friend,
his name is Victor.

55:38.369 --> 55:40.069
You don't have any lady friends?

55:41.405 --> 55:43.672
Come on, come on.

55:50.448 --> 55:53.582
So, can I put this here?
Yeah, sure, wherever you want.

56:08.065 --> 56:09.833
How much is in here?

56:09.834 --> 56:11.701
Three million.

56:11.702 --> 56:14.804
U.S. dollars?
Of course.

56:14.805 --> 56:19.109
So you're telling me, there are
30,000 $100 dollar bills here?

56:19.110 --> 56:21.544
Correct!

56:21.545 --> 56:23.947
It doesn't look like 30,000.

56:23.948 --> 56:27.850
Well, looks can be deceiving.

56:32.390 --> 56:34.090
So how do I get this shit off?

56:34.091 --> 56:37.727
That's why Victor is here.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.062
Let's go.

56:39.063 --> 56:42.599
Can I please have a spoon
and bowl?

56:42.600 --> 56:46.969
Ah, here's a spoon.

56:51.542 --> 56:53.009
Is this okay?
Mm-hm.

56:53.010 --> 56:54.744
The spoon, you need anything
else?

56:54.745 --> 56:55.878
No.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.697
Are the chemicals toxic?

57:14.698 --> 57:18.835
No, but it can
stain your fingers.

57:18.836 --> 57:21.738
That's Tebi-Manetic,
it's a solvent.

57:21.739 --> 57:25.742
It is used to
dissolve the black coating.

57:25.743 --> 57:28.144
What's that?
Humine Powder.

57:28.145 --> 57:31.881
It serves as a catalyst.

57:31.882 --> 57:33.917
What's a catalyst?

57:33.918 --> 57:38.020
A catalyst helps to increase
the rate of reaction.

57:41.058 --> 57:43.560
Jesus! How many chemicals
do I need?

57:43.561 --> 57:48.665
SSD Super Solution is
the third and final one.

57:48.666 --> 57:53.635
Next to Tebi-Manetic, it will
remove the black dye completely.

57:57.675 --> 57:59.242
And do I need one of those
syringes?

57:59.243 --> 58:00.843
No.

58:15.626 --> 58:19.996
Hah-hah,
Ben Franklin, hello.

58:19.997 --> 58:27.703
Are you fucking kidding me?

58:31.876 --> 58:33.742
Let me see that.

58:40.284 --> 58:42.284
There he is.

58:44.255 --> 58:46.922
I'm speechless.

58:49.193 --> 58:51.261
So how much of this
stuff do I need?

58:51.262 --> 58:54.764
20 kilograms of humine powder...

58:54.765 --> 58:58.067
and about 12 liters
of each of the solution.

58:58.068 --> 58:59.869
And how much is that gonna
cost me?

58:59.870 --> 59:02.539
$7,000.
$5,000.

59:02.540 --> 59:04.874
Which is it, 7,000 or 5,000?

59:04.875 --> 59:06.775
$5,000.
$7,000.

59:11.148 --> 59:13.782
Which is it?
$5,000.

59:19.990 --> 59:23.226
All right, oh, no, no, no!

59:23.227 --> 59:26.296
Uh, don't touch that,
I've got a cold.

59:26.297 --> 59:29.999
And, uh, just not help...

59:30.000 --> 59:33.202
Just put it down, there's toilet
paper in the...

59:33.203 --> 59:37.206
<i>Bathroom or toilet paper,
just use that, okay?</i>

59:37.207 --> 59:38.674
<i>Yeah, sorry.</i>

59:41.111 --> 59:45.214
<i>In Nigeria, napkins are called
serviettes, serviette.</i>

59:45.215 --> 59:48.750
<i>Serviette?</i>

59:56.827 --> 01:00:01.864
So, how long is it gonna take
me to do all the cleaning?

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:03.766
One week, tops.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:08.037
And you'll show me how to do
all the chemicals again?

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:12.108
Of course, my friend, by the
time we leave you today...

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.909
you will be an expert
at cleaning black money.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.147
Where are the chemicals?

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:22.351
Victor! Victor! Victor!

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:33.663
It's okay, we're okay, I got
time.

01:00:33.664 --> 01:00:37.900
Heads up, everyone, suspect is
heading downstairs.

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:40.769
Uche, follow him!

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:44.306
Uche! Take off your jacket!

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:52.535
<i>You have reached...</i>

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:55.838
<i>the voice mailbox of...
Kingsley Okocha.</i>

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.141
<i>Please record your voice
message.</i>

01:02:58.142 --> 01:03:02.111
Dad, give me a call back when
you get this message.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:06.015
Look, I'm serious, it's an
emergency.

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:07.949
You can reach me at this number.

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:19.395
Eze, Bimbo told me that you ran
off with Pius...

01:03:19.396 --> 01:03:23.866
so I know you are in there,
open up!

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:25.968
I have not told your mother,
so there is still time...

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:28.136
for you to stop this
foolishness.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.276
Eze...

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:36.012
as God is my witness,
this thing you are doing...

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:40.549
you will not succeed, do you
hear me? I promise you!

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:23.892
State your name for the camera.

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:28.864
Babatunde Oguntade.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:34.370
State your name!

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.572
Pius.

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:38.908
Pius what?

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:41.010
Nwosu.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:42.445
I am Nifemi Olufayo...

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:47.049
agent for the Economic
Financial Crimes Commissions...

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.620
and that is U.S. Secret Service
Agent Dennis Blake.

01:04:50.621 --> 01:04:54.190
Now the Secret Service is here
because they investigate...

01:04:54.191 --> 01:04:56.559
U.S. financial crimes.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.663
Now before we start, I am
required to inform you that...

01:05:00.664 --> 01:05:04.600
you are under no obligations
to answer my questions.

01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:09.672
Anything you say or do will be
used as evidence against you.

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:11.239
Understand?

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:19.247
What is this?

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:24.086
Black money, correct?

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:28.524
According to you two, underneath
this black coating...

01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:32.695
is a $100 dollar bill and it was
your intention to convince...

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:36.966
Agent Dennis to purchase a set
of expensive chemicals.

01:05:36.967 --> 01:05:43.973
Except this thing you
call "black money"...

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:47.376
is actually only
construction paper...

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:49.512
and those "expensive
chemicals"...

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:52.280
are just cheap household
products!

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:59.021
Now do you know the penalty
for obtaining funds...

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:00.990
under false pretense?

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:06.162
Up to seven years in prison.

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:10.633
Now I know you both don't want
that, do you?

01:06:12.669 --> 01:06:14.704
We are recording!

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:17.272
Madam,
it's an emergency.

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.544
Wha...

01:06:58.015 --> 01:06:59.482
What are you doing?

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:02.617
I've been asked to release them.

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:06.255
What's going on?

01:07:06.256 --> 01:07:08.790
You are free to go.

01:07:22.406 --> 01:07:23.538
Me?

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.508
What happened this afternoon?

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.176
It was a mistake, sir.

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:36.812
No, it was more than a mistake!

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:38.881
Do you know how much I had
to pay...

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.683
for them to set the two
of you free?

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:47.389
I take 20 percent from your
scams, correct?

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:48.823
Correct, sir.

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:54.662
Starting today, I want
40 percent. Are you hearing me?

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.163
Yes, sir.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:05.241
See, this is why people like you
have to pay people like me.

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:07.575
I am your insurance policy.

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:12.648
So, where is my money?

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:15.350
I have two million so far.

01:09:15.352 --> 01:09:20.587
Two million? Only half?!

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:27.796
I gave you a second chance,
don't make me take it away.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:31.634
Four million by noon tomorrow.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:36.470
No excuses! Go.

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:42.343
Wait! One more thing.

01:09:44.915 --> 01:09:47.515
Who is Eze?

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.685
He is my cousin.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.554
Are you trying to scam him?

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:53.555
No, sir!

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:56.458
A woman came by the station
and filed a report that you...

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:57.660
were trying to scam him.

01:09:57.661 --> 01:09:59.794
That is not true, sir!

01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:03.465
The boy is American, correct?

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:05.366
Yes, sir.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:11.639
Please, sir! I didn't... agh!

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:21.449
Enough!

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:28.356
Return that boy to that
woman, you hear me?

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:32.627
Take him!

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.845
Can you drive?

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:00.582
Yeah.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:03.651
Come with me.

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:23.504
What are we doing here?
Ssh!

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:29.445
Stop fooling!

01:12:29.446 --> 01:12:32.114
You still haven't told
me why we're here?

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:37.653
You see that silver car? See the
black car in front of it?

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:40.356
This is the key to that car.

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:42.825
I need you to drive it
and follow me.

01:12:42.826 --> 01:12:44.560
Whose car is that?

01:12:44.561 --> 01:12:50.032
My friend's... you said you
wanted to help me.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.634
This is your chance.

01:12:52.635 --> 01:12:54.970
Yeah, I wanted to help you scam,
not steal cars.

01:12:54.971 --> 01:12:56.905
We are not stealing cars,
that's my friend's car.

01:12:56.906 --> 01:12:58.874
We're bringing it to him.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.809
Then why are you hiding?

01:13:00.810 --> 01:13:05.980
If you don't want to help, I can
take you back to my mother.

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:30.472
<i>Someone is
approaching your area.</i>

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:32.040
The young man?

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.109
<i>Yes, where is he heading?</i>

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.044
The black Toyota.

01:13:36.045 --> 01:13:38.547
<i>That's where
you arrested Pius correct?</i>

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:39.781
Standby.

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:45.087
Hey! Hey!

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:46.422
Shit.

01:13:46.423 --> 01:13:48.424
Where are the chemicals?

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:50.626
The what?
Where are the chemicals?

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:53.128
Sir, I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:56.697
Oh... sorry.

01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:11.546
It's not the car, he's American.

01:14:43.179 --> 01:14:44.546
What is this, man?

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:45.913
Just get the rest!

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:27.655
Pius!

01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:31.792
Wait here... keys!

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:27.115
Don't worry, they won't find
anything.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.750
I hope you were not followed.

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:32.120
No. Here.

01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:35.190
You dumped everything?
Uh-huh.

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:36.791
Good!

01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:44.031
Yes.

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:48.170
He is family.

01:16:48.171 --> 01:16:49.805
You haven't answered my
question.

01:16:49.806 --> 01:16:51.740
What are we doing next?

01:16:51.741 --> 01:16:54.743
Nothing is next, I'm done.

01:16:54.744 --> 01:16:57.779
Until when?
I am done!

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:01.083
Completely?
Yes.

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:05.087
You're being paranoid! This is
just a one-time thing.

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:06.622
They will leave you alone...

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:08.256
as soon as the investigation
is over.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:11.159
What of Smart? Will Smart leave
me alone?

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.998
Do not worry about Smart. I can
help you pay your 40 percent.

01:17:15.999 --> 01:17:19.067
Everyday is for the thief,
one day is for the owner.

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:20.769
Do you know what that means?

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:23.171
It means, you should stop
while you still have your head!

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:25.774
I can hide from the EFCC
and the Secret Service...

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:27.275
but I cannot hide from Smart.

01:17:27.276 --> 01:17:29.811
There is no where in Lagos
that man cannot find me.

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:30.812
Then leave Lagos!

01:17:30.813 --> 01:17:32.314
Leave Lagos and go where?

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.983
Lagos is my home, no, I have to
find this man that money.

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:36.318
There is no way around it.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:39.354
Give yourself a brain.

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:42.891
Smart does not
give second chances!

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:45.160
He will kill you, whether
you find the money or not!

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:48.196
Why would he do that?

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:50.766
To send a message to others who
may be as foolish as you are!

01:17:50.767 --> 01:17:55.437
If he wanted to kill me,
I would be dead already.

01:17:55.438 --> 01:17:58.006
I have warned you.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.273
My hands are clean.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:07.015
Look, we do not have to agree!
Just help me, please!

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:09.685
Baba, I am begging you.

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:11.786
I am done.

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:56.398
Should I be worried?

01:18:58.501 --> 01:19:00.068
I told you, I owe someone.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.168
It does not concern you.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:07.375
Who was that guy at the house?

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.010
His name is Baba.

01:19:09.011 --> 01:19:12.080
He was the one who
taught me scamming.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.250
So, why'd we leave his car?

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:20.422
There was evidence in the trunk,
you saw it.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:22.390
So, that's why you
needed me to drive...

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:25.292
so I'd get caught with
the evidence and not you.

01:19:31.901 --> 01:19:33.834
Do you still want
to help me scam?

01:19:39.842 --> 01:19:41.777
What do you need me to do?

01:19:41.778 --> 01:19:43.979
Who do you know with money?

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.814
Nobody.

01:19:45.815 --> 01:19:49.317
You do, just think.

01:19:49.318 --> 01:19:51.153
I don't know any rich people.

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:54.021
They don't need to be rich,
they just cannot be poor.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:20:01.263
What about you? Who do you
know with money?

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:03.899
I've scammed all the people
I know.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.399
Some of them, even twice.

01:20:07.937 --> 01:20:09.971
Why don't we just do
another email scam?

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.206
That one is a long con.

01:20:11.207 --> 01:20:14.041
We need something short
and sweet.

01:20:18.014 --> 01:20:20.816
You don't have to be involved in
the scam, if that's your worry.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:22.150
I will handle it.

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:26.388
All I need from you is a person,
that's it!

01:20:26.389 --> 01:20:28.323
What are you gonna do to him?

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:32.394
I don't know yet. It depends
on the circumstance.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:35.330
Are you going to hurt him?

01:20:35.331 --> 01:20:37.599
No! God forbid!

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:43.038
Your father, he's expecting
your return.

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:49.845
How long will that offer last?
He is expecting you, right?

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:52.147
Yes!
Then what is holding you?

01:20:52.148 --> 01:20:54.982
Does this man mean more
to you than going home?

01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:58.520
Eze, look at me!

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:02.490
Does this man mean more to
you than going back home?

01:21:02.491 --> 01:21:04.558
Just be honest with yourself.

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:10.565
No.

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:12.499
Then who is this person?

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:44.032
You said all you needed
was a name.

01:21:44.033 --> 01:21:46.534
He doesn't know me,
he knows you.

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:48.203
What am I gonna say?

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:51.339
Tell him to meet you at 68
Rumokoro tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.!

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:52.674
Why is he meeting me?

01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:54.476
Make something up!
Like what?

01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:57.178
I don't know him, you know him!

01:21:57.179 --> 01:21:59.914
You know what will make
him come.

01:22:08.157 --> 01:22:13.027
Hey... it's Eze.

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:30.979
Is this the right address?

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.147
Yeah, this is the address.

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:36.050
Okay, thank you.

01:22:54.370 --> 01:23:00.108
Hi, I'm looking for Eazy.
Do you know where he is?

01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:03.078
You mean Eze?

01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:05.580
Yeah.

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:08.582
He's coming, take a seat.

01:23:09.719 --> 01:23:11.186
Where is he?

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:15.223
He's on his way, please,
take a seat.

01:23:15.224 --> 01:23:16.523
Okay.

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:24.666
He called me yesterday
and said he needed my help.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:28.669
Apparently, someone took his
money... again!

01:23:30.606 --> 01:23:32.706
Is he okay?
Yes, he's okay.

01:23:35.144 --> 01:23:38.613
Yeah, but was he robbed? Did he
get physically hurt?

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:42.016
Do not worry, when he comes,
he will tell you himself.

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:47.188
How do you know Eze?

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:48.655
We are friends.

01:23:50.026 --> 01:23:52.227
What's your name?

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.528
Victor.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.662
I'm Wallace.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.341
Dad?

01:24:06.342 --> 01:24:09.210
Eze, good morning.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:11.780
What took so long to call
me back?

01:24:11.781 --> 01:24:13.314
<i>I've been busy.</i>

01:24:13.315 --> 01:24:16.217
I said it was an emergency.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:17.652
How was school?

01:24:17.653 --> 01:24:18.686
<i>Mom told you?</i>

01:24:18.687 --> 01:24:20.155
Yes, last night.

01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:22.290
Did she tell you,
she lied to me?

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:23.825
<i>She told me everything.</i>

01:24:23.826 --> 01:24:26.194
Did you agree with her?

01:24:26.195 --> 01:24:29.497
Your mother wants what's
best for you.

01:24:29.498 --> 01:24:31.132
<i>What about what I want?</i>

01:24:31.133 --> 01:24:35.470
Eze, do this for her, please!

01:24:35.471 --> 01:24:38.073
Dad, I'm buying a plane ticket
home tonight.

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:39.674
<i>Where are
you getting the money?</i>

01:24:39.675 --> 01:24:41.476
Pius.
<i>Who?</i>

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:42.677
Grace's son.

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:45.313
Does your mother know?

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:46.681
<i>No.</i>

01:24:46.682 --> 01:24:48.682
She's going to kill you.

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:52.821
Dad, can I stay with you?

01:24:52.822 --> 01:24:54.422
<i>No!</i>

01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:55.623
Where else am I going to stay?

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:58.193
You can stay right
where you are!

01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:00.128
Dad, I never asked you
for anything.

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:02.230
Can you please just do
this one thing for me?

01:25:02.231 --> 01:25:04.866
No! You're not bringing me
into this!

01:25:04.867 --> 01:25:08.570
You're already in it!
<i>I said, no!</i>

01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:10.638
<i>Eze, I'm serious!</i>

01:25:10.639 --> 01:25:13.541
<i>I know you want to come
home and I don't blame you...</i>

01:25:13.542 --> 01:25:15.643
<i>but you can't always
get what you want.</i>

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:18.546
That's just life.

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:20.348
Yeah, I'm sorry, Eze,
I have a customer.

01:25:20.349 --> 01:25:21.583
I'll talk to you later.

01:25:21.584 --> 01:25:22.851
Dad!
<i>Bye.</i>

01:25:22.852 --> 01:25:26.453
Dad! Fuck!

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.567
Hello?

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:44.305
Oh, you're outside, okay,
I'll tell him.

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:48.877
Eze is outside.

01:25:48.878 --> 01:25:50.712
Is he?!

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:57.851
Yes, he's outside the gate
and please, bring him this?

01:26:00.289 --> 01:26:01.589
What's this?

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:04.893
Supplies... it's from his
mother.

01:26:04.894 --> 01:26:08.629
Okay, thank you.

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:34.389
Get down! Down! Don't move!
Lie down!

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:38.793
Down! Don't move! Where's your
partner?

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:40.460
I don't know what you're
talking about!

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:54.609
Keep moving, keep moving!

01:27:51.834 --> 01:27:53.601
You, get up!

01:27:53.602 --> 01:27:54.702
Why am I here?

01:27:54.703 --> 01:27:56.370
Get up now!

01:28:16.558 --> 01:28:18.359
Let's go.

01:28:20.329 --> 01:28:21.695
Enter.

01:28:26.302 --> 01:28:29.870
Remove his handcuffs now!
He's a civilized man.

01:28:33.542 --> 01:28:35.309
You can sit down.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:48.955
Does this look familiar?
I wonder what is inside.

01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:10.510
Do you know what this is?

01:29:13.482 --> 01:29:17.818
They are chemicals for
a black money scam.

01:29:19.555 --> 01:29:23.024
Remember that man you saw
this morning?

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:26.594
He is under investigation
by the EFCC...

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:30.098
and the U.S. Secret Service
for selling chemicals.

01:29:30.099 --> 01:29:32.667
Just like these ones.

01:29:32.668 --> 01:29:36.771
Given your affiliation with
Pius and this evidence...

01:29:36.772 --> 01:29:40.842
a lawyer will inform you that
after a preliminary hearing...

01:29:40.843 --> 01:29:42.110
your case will go to court.

01:29:42.111 --> 01:29:46.114
And since you are a flight
risk...

01:29:46.115 --> 01:29:49.884
we will have to detain you
until then.

01:29:49.885 --> 01:29:53.087
Also, the lawyer will inform
you how long...

01:29:53.088 --> 01:29:55.790
it takes to process the
paperworks.

01:29:55.791 --> 01:30:00.561
Though, I hear that you practice
accounting in Lagos...

01:30:00.562 --> 01:30:06.066
so you may be fairly familiar
with that already.

01:30:12.941 --> 01:30:14.775
How much do you want?

01:30:32.861 --> 01:30:35.430
This time, I've helped you.

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:39.500
Next time, I will not be
so generous!

01:30:39.501 --> 01:30:42.136
I understand.

01:30:42.137 --> 01:30:45.072
Have you returned the
American boy?

01:30:45.073 --> 01:30:47.775
I will return him tonight, sir!

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:52.780
Do not scam him! I mean it!

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:54.147
Okay.

01:31:02.524 --> 01:31:04.224
Sir?!

01:31:08.997 --> 01:31:10.832
Yes?

01:31:10.833 --> 01:31:12.666
Where is Ikenna?

01:31:23.579 --> 01:31:25.913
I don't know anyone
called Ikenna.

01:31:25.914 --> 01:31:29.116
The young boy in your office.

01:31:29.117 --> 01:31:32.118
I don't know who you
are talking about.

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:36.523
There was no one in my
office.

01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:40.794
Do you understand?

01:32:09.625 --> 01:32:11.224
Femi!

01:32:41.723 --> 01:32:42.923
How are you?

01:32:45.694 --> 01:32:48.596
Everything is fine,
I have a plan.

01:32:50.766 --> 01:32:52.600
Get your things! We are
going to the airport now!

01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:53.901
Is Wallace okay?

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:56.637
Yes, he is fine! Grab your bag!

01:32:56.638 --> 01:32:58.639
Did you scam him?
Yes!

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.174
What happened?

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:02.009
Are you ready to go?

01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:04.712
Tell me what happened!
It's complicated!

01:33:04.713 --> 01:33:06.714
What do you mean, it's
complicated?

01:33:06.715 --> 01:33:09.884
It's okay! I have an arrangement
with a friend at the airport.

01:33:09.885 --> 01:33:11.686
I called him just now.

01:33:11.687 --> 01:33:13.020
What's going on?

01:33:13.021 --> 01:33:14.755
It's fine, my friend is a flight
attendant.

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:16.824
If there are any remaining
seats going to America...

01:33:16.825 --> 01:33:18.292
he will give them to us,
under the table.

01:33:18.293 --> 01:33:20.094
I can't just get
on a random flight!

01:33:20.095 --> 01:33:24.131
Eze, you cannot stay with me
any longer! It is not safe!

01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:28.134
If you want to go back home,
it's now or never.

01:35:13.408 --> 01:35:14.942
Hello.

01:35:14.943 --> 01:35:16.811
Yes, he's with me.

01:35:16.812 --> 01:35:19.814
That's fine, okay. Okay, we are
walking there now.

01:35:19.815 --> 01:35:21.115
See you soon.

01:35:21.116 --> 01:35:22.917
That's my friend.

01:35:22.918 --> 01:35:25.019
He says he has a flight to
Atlanta leaving in two hours.

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.486
Is that okay?

01:35:29.891 --> 01:35:31.825
Is there anyone you regret
scamming?

01:35:34.196 --> 01:35:35.762
You did what you had to do!

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:42.770
I don't have anywhere to stay
when I get back.

01:35:42.771 --> 01:35:44.839
What do you mean?!

01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:51.779
My dad... he said I can't stay
with him.

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:53.780
So, you lied to me?

01:35:55.984 --> 01:35:57.984
I just wanted to go home.

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:08.429
Do you still want to go?

01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:09.897
I don't know.

01:36:15.203 --> 01:36:18.072
What is it? I told you,
he's here!

01:36:18.073 --> 01:36:20.207
Yes, he's sitting next to me!

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:22.208
Yes, he has everything,
just wait!

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:33.921
Don't worry, everything
will be fine.

01:36:33.922 --> 01:36:35.321
Let's go.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:44.898
Trust me.

01:37:09.891 --> 01:37:11.992
Sorry.

01:37:16.965 --> 01:37:19.266
Where are you? Okay!

01:37:19.267 --> 01:37:22.902
Passport! Eze!

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:26.207
Stay here!

01:37:26.208 --> 01:37:28.008
I want to go!
No, no!

01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:30.210
He can't see you, you can't see
him, just stay, stay!

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.181
You're by the entrance?
I don't see you.

01:37:38.553 --> 01:37:41.888
Okay, I see you.

01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:50.396
Where is he?

01:38:03.245 --> 01:38:04.978
What?

01:39:00.936 --> 01:39:04.271
Safe trip! Bye!

01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:06.539
Next, please!

01:39:38.406 --> 01:39:41.108
Safe trip!

01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:42.742
Next, please!
