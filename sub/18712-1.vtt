01:00.080 --> 01:02.040
Well done.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.200
You know that sound!

01:30.240 --> 01:33.000
- We all got to move out.
- Aw!

01:33.040 --> 01:35.000
I know, I know!

01:35.040 --> 01:38.440
Just time for one last song.

01:38.480 --> 01:43.400
For a lady
who turns 50 years old today.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.400
The Halcyon Hotel!

01:47.440 --> 01:52.160
The stories these walls could tell.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.880
So raise your glasses
and give a cheer

01:54.920 --> 01:58.560
to 50 golden years!

02:12.800 --> 02:16.280
Emma. I was wrong.

03:36.960 --> 03:42.240
No eye contact, no greetings.
Just act like they're not here.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.280
Consider me part of the wallpaper.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.164
- Good morning, Lord Hamilton.
- Thank you, Feldman.

04:03.189 --> 04:05.615
- Would you?
- Come on.

04:05.640 --> 04:07.400
Terrible weather.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.339
The Royal Suite is prepared,
Your Lordship.

04:16.363 --> 04:17.497
Thank you, Mr. Garland.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.680
You remember Miss Lambert?

04:21.720 --> 04:23.280
This way, please.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.960
- All right. Step back.
- Yes, Chef.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.560
You know what they say.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.520
Nothing good ever comes in
through the back.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.560
The vote of no confidence has
fatally wounded Chamberlain

04:47.600 --> 04:53.880
and all indications suggest that it
comes down to Halifax or Churchill now.

04:53.920 --> 04:58.240
We must use our power and influence
to guide this country

04:58.280 --> 05:00.240
in her time of need.

05:00.280 --> 05:03.295
Churchill is an idiot.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.815
Well, he sees things
as black and white.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.640
Lord Halifax understands
the situation is more nuanced.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.560
Nuanced? I was with Halifax
when he met the Fuhrer.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.800
Hitler thought he was a footman.
He handed him his coat.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.800
With all due respect, Miss Lambert,

05:18.840 --> 05:23.520
our concerns lie more
with economic implications,

05:23.560 --> 05:24.880
rather than social.

05:24.920 --> 05:28.440
The last war plunged our nation
into a recession

05:28.480 --> 05:30.920
- from which we have barely recovered.
- Hear, hear!

05:35.320 --> 05:39.560
- Gin, please.
- Yes, of course.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.002
Anything yet?

05:51.041 --> 05:53.854
Apologies, Mr. O'Hara,
but as I explained,

05:53.880 --> 05:55.360
check-in isn't until 12.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.880
Should your room become available
before then, I will inform you.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.000
Well, thank you.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.680
Well, you guys seem real busy here
today.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.880
I saw some serious-looking men

06:08.920 --> 06:11.720
in some serious-looking cars
coming in earlier.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.000
Well, sir, the Halcyon is used
for a variety of meetings

06:15.040 --> 06:17.080
and business conferences.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.520
Do they always come in through
the back, though?

06:19.560 --> 06:21.720
If... if they wish to.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.160
We try to meet all guests' needs,
whether it's how they enter the hotel

06:25.200 --> 06:27.320
or what time they wish to check in.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.720
Well, thank you.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.120
One last question.
This is probably the most important.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.320
What is your name?

06:39.320 --> 06:41.000
Emma Garland.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.400
Well, thank you for your help,
Emma Garland.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.960
The Fuhrer has already stated that he
doesn't view Britain as the enemy.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.680
Hitler also reneged on Munich.
We need to exercise caution.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.280
Surely the answer is to join
with him.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.000
No, that is not an option.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.280
We're trying to avoid
being dragged into a war,

07:14.320 --> 07:15.640
not forming an alliance.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.160
You say you're men of vision
but you're blind.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.800
Look at how he has restored
Germany's fortunes.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.043
Ten years ago, they were on
their knees.

07:23.067 --> 07:23.684
Miss Lambert...

07:23.720 --> 07:25.000
Now they tower over Europe!

07:25.040 --> 07:27.680
Hitler is not afraid to take
what he wants,

07:27.720 --> 07:30.649
to take a stand against
this plague of itinerants.

07:30.674 --> 07:33.048
Miss Lambert, your connections are
very much appreciated

07:33.079 --> 07:35.345
but you will respect
the authority of the chair.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.520
This is not up for discussion.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.760
Now, may we address
the matter at hand?

07:41.800 --> 07:44.520
I'd like another drink, please.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.840
Stay.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.280
One more, thank you.

08:09.759 --> 08:12.760
- Again.
- Charity...

08:25.840 --> 08:29.000
Please, sir. Can I have some more?

08:29.040 --> 08:30.388
Put that down!

08:30.693 --> 08:32.826
She's on my side,
aren't you, girl?

08:32.919 --> 08:36.280
She doesn't want her job taken by
some shabby little Jew, either.

08:36.306 --> 08:37.759
Charity...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.845
- You stupid idiot!
- I'm so sorry!

08:41.869 --> 08:43.164
I think that's enough, Miss Lambert.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.080
You don't tell me what to do,
Lawrence,

08:45.120 --> 08:46.720
and you don't tell me what to say!

08:46.760 --> 08:49.000
I shan't be kept in the shadows
any more.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.240
Perhaps now might be a good time
to break for tea and sandwiches.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.980
Gentlemen, if you could make your way
to the Linton Lounge

08:55.005 --> 08:56.660
at the end of the corridor.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.480
- You need to have a lie-down.
- Aren't you going to join me, Lawrence?

09:06.200 --> 09:08.400
Always just standing there
in the background.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.200
Is that what you like, Mr. Garland?

09:13.240 --> 09:15.280
To watch?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.823
- That's quite enough of that, now.
- Shut up, Lawrence.

09:20.848 --> 09:21.848
What were you thinking?

09:25.120 --> 09:27.360
- It was an accident.
- I'm not stupid, Emma.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.800
I swear - my hand just slipped.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.280
You heard what she was saying. How can
you stand there and listen to that?

09:33.320 --> 09:35.000
Because it's the job.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.920
This is Lord Hamilton's hotel
and he's been very good to us.

09:38.960 --> 09:44.480
Well, I suppose I'm an embarrassment as
a receptionist and a daughter, then.

09:44.520 --> 09:47.800
Maybe one. Not the other.

09:48.502 --> 09:50.560
Go on. Back to work.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.040
Good morning, Betsey.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.480
You're not supposed to be in here.
What if I'd been someone else?

10:24.520 --> 10:27.200
- Someone important?
- I'm sorry.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.960
I was too tired to go home
after the show.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.760
Besides, a lady needs
her beauty sleep.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.920
I think you stopped being a lady somewhere
between the seventh and eighth cocktail.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.720
I don't know how
you get up in the mornings.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.120
Housekeeping!

10:50.520 --> 10:53.440
Good morning, Mrs. Hobbs.
What are you doing in here?

10:53.480 --> 10:55.692
A guest rang to say they'd
left something behind.

10:55.717 --> 10:58.294
There's no need to clean.
The room is ready.

11:00.280 --> 11:04.480
You can tell
your little whore friend

11:04.520 --> 11:07.440
that if I catch her
in one of my rooms again

11:07.480 --> 11:08.920
she'll lose more than a shoe.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.560
Whore?

11:27.400 --> 11:28.840
Skinner.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.720
- Lady Hamilton. Welcome home.
- Your Ladyship.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.640
Thank you.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.000
She's back.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.480
Mr. Garland, Her Ladyship's here.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.360
She's not due till tomorrow.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.480
- Where is she now?
- Where do you think?

12:54.480 --> 12:56.200
Lady Hamilton?

12:57.720 --> 12:59.120
I am sorry.

13:00.560 --> 13:04.560
I'm afraid His Lordship has
a rather nasty headache.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.120
He made me promise
he would not be disturbed.

13:07.160 --> 13:13.400
Might I suggest you take some tea
in the atrium while you wait?

13:15.760 --> 13:18.080
Lady Hamilton...

13:19.440 --> 13:21.440
he really was most insistent.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.400
Don't shepherd me, Mr. Garland.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.360
I know where I'm going.

13:34.160 --> 13:38.320
I'm your employer, not a guest.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.840
I can still smell some tart.

14:28.763 --> 14:31.185
- Her Ladyship's on her way.
- Room's clear.

14:46.687 --> 14:49.327
Next time I leave, it'll be through
the front door.

14:49.367 --> 14:51.127
Here's a better idea, Miss Lambert.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.367
Consider not coming back at all.

14:53.407 --> 14:56.687
The world is changing, Mr. Garland.
You just don't see it.

15:03.323 --> 15:04.433
His Lordship?

15:05.647 --> 15:09.047
I believe His Lordship is
feeling better.

15:09.087 --> 15:11.807
He's having a drink in the bar.

15:11.847 --> 15:14.607
Would you like me to escort you
down?

15:57.527 --> 16:00.687
I thought the blues were meant
to make you feel better.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.087
Blues, jazz, call it what you want.

16:03.127 --> 16:06.607
It's all the same to me,
just one big noise.

16:06.887 --> 16:09.207
Easy on the eye, though.

16:10.527 --> 16:15.167
Bloody women. I'm getting too old
for it all.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.207
Probably why I'm hiding in here.

16:17.247 --> 16:19.847
Joe O'Hara.

16:19.887 --> 16:21.807
Lawrence Hamilton.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.767
Hamilton as in...?

16:27.178 --> 16:30.327
I'm not sure I know how to address
a lord.

16:31.454 --> 16:35.056
"Another drink, Your Lordship?"
usually works for me.

16:36.687 --> 16:38.927
Another bloody drink.

16:54.167 --> 16:56.847
Gentlemen.
Your mother's in the Royal Suite

16:56.887 --> 16:58.487
and your father is in the bar.

16:59.607 --> 17:02.447
The bar it is, then.

17:19.207 --> 17:23.087
The way I see it, appeasement
doesn't necessarily mean acceptance

17:23.127 --> 17:25.686
- or approval.
- My point exactly.

17:25.727 --> 17:28.406
It's not unpatriotic
to explore options.

17:28.446 --> 17:31.367
Hell, America's wanting to steer
clear of the whole ball game.

17:31.407 --> 17:35.887
Boys! Congratulations, Freddie. Sir Cyril
phoned me himself to tell me you'd passed.

17:35.927 --> 17:37.767
Somebody's got to fly those planes.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.887
Don't put yourself down.
They don't accept just anybody.

17:40.927 --> 17:44.007
This is Mr. O'Hara. He's an American.

17:44.047 --> 17:48.567
Freddie and Toby.
Two of my finest achievements.

17:48.607 --> 17:51.647
So, Mr. O'Hara, what do you do?

17:51.687 --> 17:56.687
Well, right now I'm discovering London
knows how to make a pretty good cocktail.

17:56.727 --> 18:00.967
Yourself? A junior researcher
at Oxford. Fairly dull, I'm afraid,

18:01.007 --> 18:03.687
as I imagine my father would be
happy to tell you.

18:03.727 --> 18:06.687
Now, now, Toby. I'm sure
you're doing important work.

18:06.727 --> 18:10.607
Ahem. I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'm
going to have to ask you to leave.

18:10.647 --> 18:12.687
There's been complaints
about the noise.

18:12.727 --> 18:16.607
Look at you, out from behind
the desk! I'm on room service.

18:16.647 --> 18:18.287
Lucky me!

18:18.327 --> 18:21.967
Hello, again. Mr. O'Hara. I trust
you're enjoying your stay?

18:22.007 --> 18:26.447
So will you be coming to my party
tomorrow, then?

18:26.487 --> 18:29.207
Well, I'll be working at your party.

18:29.247 --> 18:30.767
Well, that counts.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.167
I'm afraid that's all you're getting
tonight.

18:41.207 --> 18:46.927
On behalf of the Sonny Sullivan
band, I'd like to say thank you.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.207
You make a girl giddy.

18:52.567 --> 18:55.087
I should be heading for bed as well.

18:55.127 --> 19:01.447
Boys, don't stay up too late. Freddie, you
should be fresh for your guests tomorrow.

19:01.487 --> 19:04.167
Toby.

19:04.207 --> 19:06.527
So what's he done now?

19:06.567 --> 19:11.727
I'm afraid there are no suites available,
but we do have some superior rooms.

19:11.767 --> 19:16.796
I suppose it'll have to do. Anything
for a bit of peace and bloody quiet.

19:17.461 --> 19:19.527
It was rather a close call today.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.967
It's what you're here for, Richard.

19:22.007 --> 19:25.287
You keep my secrets, I keep yours.

19:27.927 --> 19:29.807
Come.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.207
The boys have just arrived, Your Ladyship.
They're with their father.

19:45.247 --> 19:47.407
I'll see them in the morning.

19:52.716 --> 19:55.167
What are your plans, Emma?

19:56.091 --> 19:57.583
For life?

19:59.767 --> 20:03.407
I don't know. I... haven't really
thought about it.

20:03.447 --> 20:06.807
Just the usual things, I suppose.

20:06.847 --> 20:09.807
Get married, have children.

20:09.847 --> 20:14.247
Become a fat little housewife in
a dreary little house somewhere.

20:14.287 --> 20:16.653
You don't need to.

20:18.247 --> 20:22.887
They'll tell you it's life.
They'll tell you it's growing up.

20:22.927 --> 20:24.447
But it's not.

20:28.567 --> 20:31.527
Is there anything else I can do
for Your Ladyship?

20:37.821 --> 20:39.055
Goodnight, Emma.

21:12.884 --> 21:14.993
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

21:15.018 --> 21:16.556
Where do you think we're going?

21:32.367 --> 21:35.687
Enjoying yourself, are you? Bloody
hell! Don't they teach you to knock?

21:35.727 --> 21:37.647
How did you get in here?

21:37.687 --> 21:41.167
You're the chanteuse.
What's your name?

21:41.207 --> 21:43.927
Betsey. You're not going to have me
sacked, are you?

21:45.487 --> 21:48.047
Lucky for you, Betsey,
I've had a very long day

21:48.087 --> 21:51.567
and I would like to avoid
any further drama.

21:56.582 --> 22:00.087
- You know your trouble, sir?
- Enlighten me.

22:00.127 --> 22:05.047
You complicate matters. Carrying on
with that Lambert woman for a start.

22:05.087 --> 22:08.327
- How do you know about that?
- She's the talk of the hotel.

22:09.720 --> 22:16.687
- What does your wife think about her?
- My wife and I have an understanding.

22:16.727 --> 22:19.007
Or so you think.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.967
You can't please all of them
all of the time, sir.

22:23.007 --> 22:26.367
Sooner or later, it will all come
crashing down.

22:27.487 --> 22:30.207
Yes, you may have a point there.

22:36.708 --> 22:38.487
Give me a towel, then.

22:38.527 --> 22:40.087
Yes, ma'am.

22:42.047 --> 22:44.727
God! I've not been down here
in ages.

22:44.767 --> 22:47.407
They're going to make it into
a bomb shelter.

22:47.447 --> 22:50.247
Are things really that serious?

22:51.127 --> 22:52.887
It would seem so.

22:53.767 --> 22:57.461
Aha! I'd forgotten
we'd done this.

23:00.433 --> 23:03.247
- Toby started crying.
- Yes, because you told him

23:03.287 --> 23:06.287
that the police were going to arrest
him for vandalism.

23:08.527 --> 23:12.607
And look at us now.
Pilot Officer Freddie Hamilton.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.047
It was strange,
going through training.

23:19.087 --> 23:22.167
Flying a Spitfire for the first time.

23:22.207 --> 23:25.327
But it wasn't until I put on
the uniform that I realised that...

23:25.367 --> 23:27.767
You're a real pilot?

23:27.807 --> 23:30.087
No, I was going to say
that I look good in uniform

23:30.127 --> 23:32.447
but your one sounded a lot better.

23:32.487 --> 23:34.287
Not everyone looks good in uniform.

23:37.327 --> 23:38.807
You're not bad, I suppose.

23:41.967 --> 23:43.767
I've seen worse.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.887
- I'd better...
- Get back to work, yes.

23:55.927 --> 23:57.367
I'll see you later.

24:13.207 --> 24:16.146
I think you've been reading
too many fairy tales.

24:16.171 --> 24:16.982
I'm serious.

24:17.021 --> 24:19.380
There was this big pause
and for a second it

24:19.405 --> 24:21.185
was as though something
was going to happen.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.685
- So why didn't it?
- Hey!

24:22.710 --> 24:24.812
What! No, we've been friends
since we were little.

24:24.887 --> 24:27.887
- It's not like that.
- I'll tell you what I told His Lordship.

24:27.927 --> 24:30.137
You complicate matters.

24:30.161 --> 24:32.591
And you told His Lordship
this when, exactly?

24:32.647 --> 24:36.687
- When he caught me in his bath.
- Please tell me you're joking.

24:36.727 --> 24:39.767
He's actually very sweet.
A proper gentleman.

24:42.642 --> 24:44.048
Your old man's not coming, is he?

24:44.073 --> 24:47.885
Mr. Feldman, every day your
poker corner gets mopped and scrubbed.

24:48.127 --> 24:51.007
It's even on the cleaning schedule.

24:51.047 --> 24:54.447
It's no fun if it's not secret.

24:54.487 --> 24:58.767
Try not to spill any drinks, Emma.

24:58.807 --> 25:01.007
Billy, you're smoking your stake.

25:01.047 --> 25:03.127
He was going to lose it anyway.

25:03.167 --> 25:05.807
No, I wasn't.
I've got three jacks here.

25:05.847 --> 25:08.047
Billy!

25:08.087 --> 25:10.687
- Billy!
- Honestly!

25:10.727 --> 25:14.127
I've never even thought of Freddie
that way.

25:14.167 --> 25:18.287
- I mean, not really.
- Probably for the best, then.

25:18.327 --> 25:20.407
Because he's His Lordship's heir

25:20.447 --> 25:22.927
and you're
just the girl behind reception.

25:40.439 --> 25:43.119
Enjoy the walk, Billy.

25:43.159 --> 25:45.159
Off you go.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.820
Lady Hamilton, I have the menus for
the party tonight, you requested.

25:55.844 --> 25:57.634
Thank you, Emma.

25:57.659 --> 25:59.705
I'll let you know
if there's anything amiss.

25:59.730 --> 26:02.124
Yes, thank you, Emma.

26:03.804 --> 26:07.724
It seems as if the Dutch are on
high alert, fearing invasion.

26:07.764 --> 26:09.764
Please, no politics at the table.

26:15.444 --> 26:19.524
I'm sorry, Miss Lambert. The restaurant
is closed to non-residents until evening.

26:19.564 --> 26:21.444
We both know that's a lie.

26:21.484 --> 26:25.644
Don't worry. His Lordship will be
pleased to see me.

26:25.684 --> 26:27.924
He always is.

26:28.884 --> 26:31.564
Please. Don't do this.

26:54.524 --> 26:56.324
What's she doing here?

26:57.764 --> 26:59.684
Lawrence!

27:02.244 --> 27:04.844
- I have no idea.
- Mother, shall we go for a walk?

27:07.204 --> 27:09.324
Under cover of darkness is
one thing.

27:09.364 --> 27:13.484
But I will not be humiliated like this
in front of my children. Do you hear?

27:19.404 --> 27:25.684
So, this policy of appeasement you
support - how's that working for you?

27:25.724 --> 27:29.964
When you decide to do something useful
with your pathetic little life,

27:30.004 --> 27:32.564
and not before.

27:39.204 --> 27:40.364
Lawrence!

27:40.404 --> 27:43.044
Lawrence. Lawrence! Wait!

27:43.084 --> 27:44.564
I'm coming with you to the house.

27:44.604 --> 27:47.684
I have asked you to be discreet.
This is not discreet.

27:47.724 --> 27:50.804
I have waited.
I have listened to your promises.

27:50.844 --> 27:53.884
I have done everything
you have asked.

27:53.924 --> 27:58.644
Now is the time to choose.
Do you want me or not, Lawrence?

27:58.924 --> 28:01.444
We'll... discuss this elsewhere.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.484
I'm thinking, we get a long enough
lead for the microphone,

28:08.524 --> 28:10.844
all the way down here -
it might work.

28:12.204 --> 28:14.844
Help me up, then.

28:18.764 --> 28:21.084
Why do you want to sing on the bar?

28:21.124 --> 28:24.524
Because it's show business,
Sonny Sullivan.

28:24.564 --> 28:28.324
Keep 'em watching.
Keep 'em on their toes.

28:38.124 --> 28:40.204
It's never going to happen, Sonny.

28:40.244 --> 28:42.884
Just you wait.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.564
Here - let me.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.244
That was quite the scene in there.

29:07.284 --> 29:09.804
I saw you standing up
to your old man.

29:09.844 --> 29:12.164
That takes some guts.

29:12.204 --> 29:15.404
I was stupid to even try.
He never listens to me.

29:15.444 --> 29:18.084
- Freddie, maybe, but...
- Why would you think that?

29:18.124 --> 29:23.084
Because Freddie's the heir by virtue of the
fact that he was born four minutes before me.

29:23.124 --> 29:25.799
And those four minutes count
for a lot, right?

29:25.824 --> 29:28.724
Who's that woman who came in?

29:30.004 --> 29:32.324
Charity Lambert, his... His...?

29:32.364 --> 29:34.684
Fancy lady.

29:34.724 --> 29:39.444
There've been others, believe me,
but she's the worst

29:39.484 --> 29:41.324
and I doubt she comes cheap.

29:41.364 --> 29:45.844
Well, I hate to say it
but she is kind of a knockout.

29:45.884 --> 29:49.564
Yeah - sure.
Blond hair, blue eyes...

29:52.414 --> 29:55.004
No wonder the Germans love her.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.004
The Germans?

29:58.044 --> 30:00.804
Has she spent some time over there?

30:00.844 --> 30:02.484
In Munich.

30:02.524 --> 30:06.084
I believe she made
a lot of very influential friends,

30:06.124 --> 30:07.484
as it were.

30:10.084 --> 30:12.084
Well, I don't know how things work
over here

30:12.124 --> 30:15.924
but the way I see it, your dad had
no right snapping at you like that.

30:15.964 --> 30:18.844
Well,
at least somebody's on my side.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.764
Hell, I'll even buy you a drink.
Come on.

30:20.804 --> 30:22.108
You look like you could use one.

30:22.147 --> 30:24.899
It's possibly a bit early
in the day for it.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.964
Well, like they say...
it's five o'clock somewhere, right?

30:35.453 --> 30:38.733
Your Ladyship. What can I do for you?

30:41.333 --> 30:43.813
How long is it since your wife died?

30:46.619 --> 30:48.306
Ten years.

30:50.573 --> 30:53.053
I was surprised
when my husband appointed you.

30:55.693 --> 30:58.413
You seem a man of limited worth.

30:58.453 --> 31:01.533
I supposed you've served him well.

31:01.573 --> 31:05.333
Everything I do is in service
to your family.

31:05.373 --> 31:07.093
You included.

31:07.133 --> 31:10.373
In that case...

31:11.613 --> 31:16.453
I require a list of all the women with whom
my husband has fraternised behind my back,

31:16.493 --> 31:19.613
every sordid little story
that you've helped to hide.

31:20.893 --> 31:24.013
Your husband loves you very much.

31:24.053 --> 31:27.933
- Don't patronise me.
- You're right. I apologise.

31:29.853 --> 31:33.733
But don't ask me to pick sides,
Lady Hamilton,

31:33.773 --> 31:36.093
because you won't win.

31:37.493 --> 31:39.813
I wish I respected you.

31:40.693 --> 31:43.853
But I can't. If it were up to me,
you'd be out of a job.

31:46.453 --> 31:48.893
Then I'm very happy
it is not up to you.

31:50.333 --> 31:52.013
Thank you, Mr. Garland.

31:52.053 --> 31:54.173
I shan't forget that.

32:04.933 --> 32:08.293
I feel for the son. He's a good kid.

32:08.333 --> 32:10.613
"Yeah. You're all heart, Joe.

32:10.653 --> 32:17.533
Stand by. In five, four, three..."

32:17.573 --> 32:20.093
Good morning, America!

32:20.133 --> 32:24.693
This is Joe O'Hara, live for CBA,
reporting from London,

32:24.733 --> 32:28.373
where the spectre of fascism haunts
the capital's West End.

32:28.413 --> 32:33.573
I'm staying at the luxurious Halcyon
Hotel, where I can reveal

32:33.613 --> 32:39.293
prominent businessmen, aristocrats and
politicians met this week in secret

32:39.333 --> 32:44.813
to discuss a deal with none other
than Adolf Hitler himself.

32:48.375 --> 32:49.765
You should prepare for the worst.

32:49.790 --> 32:52.969
This broadcast is your fault.
You were meant to keep on top of things.

32:53.135 --> 32:55.495
You brought your mistress
to your own hotel.

32:55.535 --> 32:59.775
What did you think would happen?
Don't you take that tone with me!

32:59.815 --> 33:02.295
When I think of what I've done
for you,

33:02.335 --> 33:04.695
where you would have been
without me...

33:06.895 --> 33:10.895
- I am grateful.
- I don't want your bloody gratitude.

33:10.935 --> 33:13.175
You are meant to protect me.

33:14.535 --> 33:20.255
Please. Whatever it takes.
Help me on this, Richard.

33:20.295 --> 33:22.135
The broadcast only goes out to
America

33:22.175 --> 33:24.095
and we have people
at most of the papers

33:24.127 --> 33:26.284
who reassure me they won't be
running with this.

33:26.316 --> 33:26.871
Most?

33:26.895 --> 33:29.655
There's a new editor
at the Telegraph, Mr. Briggs.

33:29.695 --> 33:31.523
- And we don't know him?
- No.

33:31.547 --> 33:33.070
He's going to run the story?

33:33.135 --> 33:37.375
Lord Hamilton, Miss Lambert,

33:37.415 --> 33:40.095
a gripping mix of fact and fiction,
mostly fiction.

33:40.135 --> 33:42.335
Sells papers, though.

33:42.375 --> 33:46.695
Please send Mr. Briggs a most gracious
invite to Freddie's party this evening.

33:46.735 --> 33:50.735
And fetch me my address book,
will you? I have calls to make.

33:58.934 --> 34:00.059
You're excused.

34:09.895 --> 34:12.775
- Would you like some help?
- No, no.

34:15.666 --> 34:17.985
You heard about the radio broadcast,
then?

34:18.025 --> 34:19.866
That bloody American.

34:21.505 --> 34:23.226
What are you going to do?

34:23.266 --> 34:26.146
Well, we have guests coming tonight.

34:26.186 --> 34:27.866
Friends of Mother and Father. VIPs.

34:27.906 --> 34:31.306
I will do what I've been brought up
to do. I'll smile.

34:31.346 --> 34:33.306
I'll be polite.

34:33.346 --> 34:35.386
And pretend nothing is ever wrong.

34:41.896 --> 34:43.866
- Stay still.
- I am staying still.

34:55.186 --> 34:57.666
I er... I'll see you at the party.

34:57.706 --> 34:59.426
Yes.

35:01.386 --> 35:02.906
Freddie!

35:02.946 --> 35:04.186
Hello!

35:04.226 --> 35:06.986
Hello. Good to see you.
How are you?

35:12.226 --> 35:13.986
Mr. Briggs is en route.

35:14.026 --> 35:16.066
Thank you, Mr. Feldman.

35:16.106 --> 35:21.026
I don't suppose you know
where Wellington is?

35:21.066 --> 35:23.586
You've lost His Lordship's dog?

35:23.626 --> 35:27.706
Well, I... I ain't lost him. I just
don't know where he is, Skinner.

35:27.746 --> 35:30.175
You might as well leave
the country, Billy.

35:30.199 --> 35:30.949
Don't say that.

35:30.971 --> 35:33.106
That's like losing
a member of their family.

35:33.146 --> 35:35.026
Capital offence.

35:42.282 --> 35:44.303
- Mr. Briggs.
- Mr. Garland.

35:44.328 --> 35:46.786
I'm so glad you
accepted our invitation.

35:46.826 --> 35:50.426
- I was intrigued.
- Let me show you around.

35:56.106 --> 35:58.586
Can you help me
with these damn cufflinks?

35:58.626 --> 36:01.786
How did we do it?

36:01.826 --> 36:03.866
What's that?

36:03.906 --> 36:06.466
How did we live like this
for so long?

36:06.506 --> 36:09.346
Pretending it's fine
when everything's falling apart.

36:09.386 --> 36:11.586
Priscilla!

36:17.706 --> 36:21.146
You were so handsome.
We were so young.

36:23.266 --> 36:24.906
And I loved you...

36:24.946 --> 36:26.426
so, so much.

36:30.423 --> 36:32.025
We won't tell the boys
until tomorrow.

36:32.050 --> 36:33.050
What?

36:35.066 --> 36:38.506
Tonight, I want you at my side

36:38.546 --> 36:41.306
and thereafter I shall stay
in the country.

36:42.746 --> 36:47.003
- And you can do as you please.
- I... I can make things better.

36:47.028 --> 36:48.386
No, Lawrence, you can't.

36:52.106 --> 36:54.306
This marriage is over.

37:02.666 --> 37:05.666
I hear we're going to be
front-page news tomorrow.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.146
You know you're the only paper
running the story?

37:10.186 --> 37:12.866
Our readers deserve the truth.

37:13.746 --> 37:16.986
Have you ever tried the lobster
at the Savoy?

37:19.146 --> 37:22.386
- I'm not sure that I have.
- You have.

37:25.306 --> 37:27.946
February 4th of this year.

37:27.986 --> 37:31.626
You see, like you, it's my job
to know things, too.

37:31.666 --> 37:36.466
For example, I know why you booked
a room there for one night only.

37:36.506 --> 37:39.506
I know the name of the girl
who visited you

37:39.546 --> 37:43.266
for an hour and a half at 9:35pm.

37:43.306 --> 37:46.026
I also know that you ordered
the Lobster de la Manche.

37:46.066 --> 37:50.706
- Are you trying to blackmail me?
- No, Mr. Briggs.

37:50.746 --> 37:55.906
I'm trying to impress you.
I like you.

37:55.946 --> 37:57.826
I like your paper.

37:59.306 --> 38:01.506
I do hope we can be friends.

38:07.560 --> 38:09.946
I like you, too.

38:11.226 --> 38:13.466
That makes me very happy.

38:15.906 --> 38:18.786
Now, I believe the party awaits.

38:18.826 --> 38:20.906
After you.

38:28.626 --> 38:30.506
Another two.

38:58.826 --> 39:01.146
Go on, Freddie!

39:32.586 --> 39:34.346
Enter.

39:39.666 --> 39:41.786
Shouldn't you be at your party?
I was.

39:41.826 --> 39:44.626
- I wanted to speak to you.
- All right.

39:44.666 --> 39:47.466
They've cancelled leave.

39:47.506 --> 39:50.026
I have to go back to base
first thing tomorrow.

39:50.066 --> 39:53.706
Did you know about this?
Well, they'll be preparing you,

39:53.746 --> 39:58.506
to send out squadrons to support the
British Expeditionary Force in France.

40:01.226 --> 40:04.706
- So it's really happening, then.
- Well, I'm sorry, I did my best

40:04.746 --> 40:07.466
but it looks like it will be
Churchill's country now.

40:11.866 --> 40:13.946
What, was there something else?

40:13.986 --> 40:16.866
You have to stop.

40:16.906 --> 40:19.066
You have to stop treating Mother like
this.

40:19.106 --> 40:20.626
- Mind your tone!
- No, I won't.

40:21.168 --> 40:24.402
Carrying on in that way -
you're humiliating her!

40:28.506 --> 40:31.546
Don't make the same mistakes
as I did.

40:31.586 --> 40:35.786
I took something beautiful
and I destroyed it.

40:36.826 --> 40:39.266
Just because I could.

40:44.546 --> 40:46.866
Go on.

40:46.906 --> 40:52.906
Go down and enjoy yourself.
I'll er... I'll follow you down.

41:19.506 --> 41:21.026
O'Hara.

41:24.466 --> 41:26.146
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Stand up!

41:26.171 --> 41:27.832
I don't want to get into
this with you.

41:27.857 --> 41:29.266
- Stand up!
- Freddie!

41:29.306 --> 41:33.466
Freddie...
Freddie, back to your party.

41:33.506 --> 41:34.986
I was just doing my job.

41:41.186 --> 41:43.386
What did you think would happen,
Mr. O'Hara?

41:43.426 --> 41:45.906
Well, the Queensberry rules,
for one.

41:48.346 --> 41:50.346
I guess you guys want me
out of here.

41:50.386 --> 41:53.786
You're still a guest
and that still means something.

41:56.586 --> 41:59.786
- Is everything all right?
- Freddie, you must stop disappearing.

42:03.586 --> 42:07.586
- Here he is!
- Here's the man of the hour!

42:11.266 --> 42:13.786
He has a wandering eye,
like his father.

42:13.826 --> 42:17.104
Kindly go upstairs and
remind my husband

42:17.129 --> 42:20.261
this is an event to be
attended by both parents.

42:42.986 --> 42:45.706
Lord Hamilton?

42:46.626 --> 42:48.666
Lord Hamilton?

42:54.986 --> 42:56.786
Lord Hamilton? Sir?

45:11.426 --> 45:13.146
Lord Hamilton.

45:14.226 --> 45:16.586
Might I have a word?

45:23.266 --> 45:25.186
Lord Hamilton.

45:26.106 --> 45:28.186
Freddie, he's talking to you.

45:53.866 --> 45:56.186
Come on. Home, boy.

45:56.226 --> 45:57.986
Come on.

45:58.026 --> 46:00.666
Come on.
