00:03.629 --> 00:04.672
Hi!

00:04.839 --> 00:07.008
- Hey!
- Hey! Welcome back!

00:07.174 --> 00:09.593
- How was the honeymoon?
- Oh, incredible!

00:09.760 --> 00:14.140
Oh, champagne, candle-lit dinners,
moonlight walks on the beach.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.434
- It was so romantic.
- Oh.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.269
- So where's Mike?
- Oh, he's at the doctor.

00:18.436 --> 00:20.438
He didn't poop while we were there.

00:23.149 --> 00:26.110
- I'm glad you're back. I need your help.
- Oh, why, what's up?

00:26.277 --> 00:29.530
I have an audition for this play,
and I have to speak French...

00:29.697 --> 00:32.867
...which, according to my résumé,
I'm fluent in.

00:33.034 --> 00:37.246
- Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
- Yeah, you really shouldn't.

00:37.413 --> 00:40.458
By the way, how was
that yearlong dig in Cairo?

00:42.293 --> 00:43.878
It was okay.

00:45.171 --> 00:46.922
I did not know you spoke French.

00:51.052 --> 00:53.262
Oh, oh, you're so sexy.

00:54.096 --> 00:56.766
- Well, so will you help me?
- Sure.

00:59.351 --> 01:02.146
Ha, ha, seriously, stop it.
I'm gonna jump on you.

01:44.355 --> 01:45.481
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:45.648 --> 01:47.650
Why are you wearing my apron?

01:48.651 --> 01:50.111
I'm making cookies for Erica.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.405
We have to leave soon.
Her plane comes in in about an hour.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.951
When she gets here, is it okay
if I introduce you two as my wife...

01:57.118 --> 01:59.703
...and the woman who's
carrying my child, ha, ha?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.373
No?

02:02.832 --> 02:04.166
Divorce?

02:06.127 --> 02:07.419
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:07.586 --> 02:10.464
- Uh, you know where Rachel is?
- Haven't seen her since morning.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.218
It's unbelievable. She was supposed
to meet me a half-hour ago with Emma.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.011
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:16.178 --> 02:19.640
- These are for Erica!
- She's gonna eat all those cookies?

02:19.807 --> 02:23.102
Well, I want the baby to come out
all cute and fat!

02:24.937 --> 02:27.982
- So, uh, why is Erica coming to visit?
- We wanna get to know her better.

02:28.149 --> 02:31.735
And, uh, she's never been to New York,
so she wants to see the tourist spots:

02:31.902 --> 02:33.863
Statue of Liberty,
Empire State Building.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.950
Oh, there's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.

02:38.117 --> 02:42.413
And, you know, there's always
some idiot who goes, "Moo."

02:42.913 --> 02:45.708
Well, if it annoys you so much,
then why do you do it?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.128
Oh, hi! Hi!

02:49.336 --> 02:52.047
- Thanks for showing up 30 minutes late.
- Ross.

02:52.256 --> 02:55.176
No, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?

02:55.342 --> 02:58.846
Uh, a mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?

02:59.680 --> 03:02.099
My father had a heart attack.

03:02.266 --> 03:04.602
While I was at Barneys.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.814
- Oh, my God, Rach.
- Honey?

03:08.981 --> 03:11.483
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, is he okay?

03:11.650 --> 03:14.111
Yeah, he's gonna be fine,
but he's heavily sedated.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.363
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Long Island with you.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.076
- I mean, you can't be alone right now.
- No, come on, I'm totally okay.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.829
I don't need you to come.

03:23.996 --> 03:29.835
- I can totally handle this on my own.
- Still, still, let me come for me.

03:30.002 --> 03:33.255
Okay. If you really need to.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.425
I bet someone could use one
of Monica's freshly baked cookies.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.635
- Oh, I really could.
- Oh.

03:37.801 --> 03:38.844
Oh.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.937
All right, it seems pretty simple.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.189
Your first line is,
"My name is Claude."

03:50.356 --> 03:52.608
- Okay.
- So just repeat after me.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.244
- Well, let's try it again.
- Okay.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.877
Huh. It's not...

04:12.044 --> 04:14.046
...quite what I'm saying.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.091
Really?
Sounds exactly the same to me.

04:18.259 --> 04:20.719
- It does, really?
- Yeah.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.388
- Let's just try it again.
- Okay.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.806
- Really listen.
- Got it.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.015
Okay.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.861
Hey, you guys!

04:38.028 --> 04:39.196
- Hi.
- Hey!

04:39.363 --> 04:41.865
I want you to meet
someone really special.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.784
- Phoebe, this is Erica.
- Hi.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.577
- And this is the baby!
- Oh, hi.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.455
- Joey, EHca, baby.
- Hi.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.125
Everyone, Erica! Baby!

04:51.709 --> 04:53.919
- Monica. Calm. Self.
- Ha, ha.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.255
- Hey, sit down.
- Thank you.

04:56.422 --> 04:59.300
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.760
Well, welcome to New York City,
or should I say:

05:03.137 --> 05:04.638
...New York City.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.766
Why would you say that?

05:09.059 --> 05:11.228
Okay. What are you
gonna be doing today?

05:11.395 --> 05:16.358
Well, I wanna see everything! Times
Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center.

05:16.525 --> 05:19.611
You should walk to the top
of the Statue of Liberty.

05:19.778 --> 05:22.656
- Oh, yeah, let's do that.
- Great.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.700
This baby better be really good.

05:30.789 --> 05:34.084
Hi, um, uh, excuse me, I'm here to see
my father. My name is Rachel Green.

05:34.251 --> 05:37.296
- And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
- Ross, please, this is a hospital.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.631
That actually means something here.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.925
- So can we please go in?
- Absolutely.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.303
Rach, I think I'm gonna
wait out here...

05:44.470 --> 05:48.432
...because, uh, my throat is feeling a
little scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.

05:48.599 --> 05:53.270
- Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
- I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.

05:53.437 --> 05:56.607
- He's under sedation, so he's out.
- I'm feeling better.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.196
Oh, my God.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.448
Oh, oh, wow.

06:04.615 --> 06:09.203
That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?

06:10.162 --> 06:13.874
Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on
the phone if you'd like to speak to him.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.709
Oh, great.
Um, are you gonna be okay?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.921
- He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
- Okay.

06:55.249 --> 06:59.128
- Uh, did the TV wake you?
- No.

06:59.294 --> 07:03.841
When you put your feet up on my bed,
you tugged on my catheter.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.263
Ouchy.

07:10.722 --> 07:12.683
What are you doing here, Geller?

07:12.850 --> 07:15.644
Well, I came with Rachel,
who should be back any second.

07:16.645 --> 07:20.482
- So, what's new?
- Oh, I had a little heart attack.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.734
Right. Is it painful?

07:22.901 --> 07:25.070
What, the heart attack
or sitting here talking to you?

07:27.239 --> 07:30.242
Let's see if we can get
that Rachel back in here.

07:30.409 --> 07:34.413
So, what's new with you? Knocked up
any more of my daughters lately?

07:34.580 --> 07:36.623
Nope. Just the one. Rachel!

07:43.255 --> 07:45.090
No!

07:45.257 --> 07:48.051
Okay, maybe if we just break it down.

07:48.218 --> 07:53.140
Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
Okay, so repeat after me.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.687
Great! Okay, faster.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.907
- Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
- What are you doing?

08:10.073 --> 08:12.826
I have to go before I put your head
through a wall.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.663
No, no. Don't go, I need you!
My audition is tomorrow!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.222
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.807
I was gonna make us some dinner...

08:35.974 --> 08:39.645
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.897
I think we solved the mystery
of the heart attack.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.026
- Did you call your parents?
- Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.569
Oh, good.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.239
Wow.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.032
What?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.743
I just can't believe
I'm in Rachel Green's room.

08:55.744 --> 09:00.832
- You've been in my room before.
- Hah, yeah, sure, right. Ha, ha.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.918
Like I'd ever be
in Rachel Green's room.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.921
Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
when you use my whole name.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.632
- Oh, ha, ha.
- Sorry.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.678
- You okay?
- Yeah.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.513
- Yeah, you had a rough day, huh?
- Yeah.

09:14.680 --> 09:19.059
It's just so weird seeing him like that,
you know? I mean, he's a doctor.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.187
You don't expect doctors to get sick.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.314
But we do.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.320
Well, he's gonna be okay, Rach.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.783
Aw.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.869
I don't want him to wake up alone.
I should go to the hospital.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.913
- What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
- What?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.748
They gave him a lot of medication.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.834
He wouldn't even know
if you were there.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.086
We'll go see him first thing
in the morning.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.839
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
- No... God, hey.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.091
Rach, you've been an
amazing daughter, okay?

09:51.258 --> 09:55.345
- Right now you need to get some rest.
- Okay, maybe you're right.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.264
Good night.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.143
Wait, wait, wait.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.771
Would you stay here with me
for a little while?

10:05.939 --> 10:08.025
- Sure.
- Okay.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.904
- Thank you for coming with me today.
- Oh, of course.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.157
Rachel Green is very happy
you're in her room.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.995
- Me too. Come here.
- No.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.416
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.

10:24.833 --> 10:29.755
Okay, well, um, I can maybe grab
a sleeping bag or...

10:45.270 --> 10:46.938
No, Rach!

10:47.689 --> 10:51.526
I'm sorry, I just don't
think this is a good idea.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.695
Well, we won't know that
until we do it, will we?

10:53.862 --> 10:56.490
No, um, uh, look, um.

10:56.990 --> 11:01.119
You are upset about your father,
and you're feeling vulnerable...

11:01.286 --> 11:03.413
...and I just don't feel
it would be right.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.583
I feel like I'd be, you know,
taking advantage of you.

11:06.750 --> 11:10.962
What...? Taking advantage?
I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!

11:12.255 --> 11:14.424
Look, I'm sure it would be great...

11:14.591 --> 11:17.886
...but I think one of us
has to be thinking clearly.

11:18.053 --> 11:20.472
So I'm gonna go.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.394
Wow.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.270
Okay.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.776
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mm-hm.

11:35.696 --> 11:39.658
I haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that!

11:45.831 --> 11:48.875
Thanks so much for taking me
to all those places. I had a great time.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.170
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I wanna apologize
about Chandler, though.

11:52.337 --> 11:57.008
- I just did not see this coming.
- New York is awesome!

11:58.844 --> 12:01.888
- What is with you?
- I've been to these places before...

12:02.055 --> 12:03.807
...but I've never really seen them.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.017
Yeah, you miss a lot
when you're mooing.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.939
- Thanks so much for showing me around.
- Oh, it was our pleasure.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.316
We're so much enjoying
getting to know you.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.944
Well, if there's anything else
you wanna know...

12:17.404 --> 12:19.197
Oh, uh...

12:19.364 --> 12:20.907
Okay, um.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.161
Can we ask you some
questions about the father?

12:24.327 --> 12:26.079
Oh, sure. Yeah.

12:26.246 --> 12:31.001
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.

12:31.877 --> 12:35.088
- Got a scholarship and went to college.
- That's great.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.718
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.

12:41.595 --> 12:42.846
How's that, now?

12:43.388 --> 12:46.224
Well, there's a chance
it's another guy.

12:46.391 --> 12:49.978
I mean, I've only ever been
with two guys...

12:50.145 --> 12:52.397
...but they sort of overlapped.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.649
So, what does the other guy do?

12:54.816 --> 12:58.278
- Does he go to college too?
- No, he's in prison.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.614
Oh.

13:00.781 --> 13:04.034
Well, um,
was he falsely accused of something?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.328
No.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.789
He killed his father with a shovel.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.667
Other than that, he's a great guy.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.754
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.807
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.684
Assume from now on
that I'm always awake.

13:31.394 --> 13:35.482
All right, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.819
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.950
Well, all right, let's say that it is him.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.785
Would we not want the baby? No.

13:46.952 --> 13:50.372
- Would we treat him any differently?
- I'd keep an eye on him.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.043
We have to find out
which the father is.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.003
- How?
- I don't know.

13:57.170 --> 14:01.299
- They have tests for these things, right?
- Yeah, but maybe we're overreacting.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.803
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.264
He probably loves his mommy.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.976
He's probably got a tattoo that says
"Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.

14:16.231 --> 14:18.984
We'll now count from one to five.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.247
Good job.
- Thank you.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.500
- Hey.
- Hey, JOEY-

14:35.667 --> 14:39.212
Listen, I feel really badly about
yesterday, and I thought about it a lot.

14:39.379 --> 14:42.966
No, I was too impatient.
So let's try it again.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.885
That's okay. I don't need your help.

14:45.051 --> 14:48.013
I worked on it myself,
and I gotta say, I am pretty good.

14:49.014 --> 14:52.642
- Really, can I hear some of it?
- Sure, sure.

14:53.643 --> 14:56.187
Okay. Ahem.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.529
See?

15:05.488 --> 15:07.324
Right, but you're not...

15:07.866 --> 15:09.326
You're not... You're...

15:09.492 --> 15:12.579
Again, you're not speaking French!

15:14.539 --> 15:18.293
Oh, well, I think I am! Yeah, and I think
I'm definitely gonna get the part!

15:18.460 --> 15:20.545
How could you possibly think that?

15:20.712 --> 15:23.423
The guy on the tape said
I was doing a good job!

15:27.594 --> 15:30.347
Hey, Rach, can you grab me
a cup of coffee?

15:32.557 --> 15:34.017
Sure.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.812
You've been quiet all morning.
ls everything okay?

15:37.979 --> 15:40.023
Mm-hm.

15:41.483 --> 15:43.693
- You sure you're all right?
- Yep.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.154
Okay. Um.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.782
Well, I'm gonna go, uh,
grab us some breakfast.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.785
- FYI.
- There it is.

15:53.078 --> 15:59.876
In the future, when a girl asks for some
ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.

16:00.919 --> 16:05.090
Wait, wait, you're, uh, mad at me
about last night?

16:05.256 --> 16:08.009
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- Really?

16:08.176 --> 16:09.844
If you had done the right thing...

16:10.011 --> 16:12.931
...I wouldn't have woken up
feeling stupid and embarrassed.

16:13.098 --> 16:16.518
I would've woken up feeling
comforted and satisfied.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.939
- Well...
- Oh, stop that!

16:21.898 --> 16:24.776
I can't believe this!
I was just being a good guy.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.529
I treated you with
respect and understanding.

16:27.696 --> 16:29.197
Oh, that is so hot.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.158
Hey, I was looking out for you.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.661
Oh, really? Well, you know what?
lam a big girl.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.497
I don't need someone telling me
what is best for me.

16:38.873 --> 16:42.335
I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot
of times before. This is the worst ever!

16:42.502 --> 16:46.881
Oh, oh, really? Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me either.

16:47.048 --> 16:49.217
Oh, okay, you know...?
Hey, hey, you know what?

16:49.384 --> 16:51.469
To avoid this little thing
in the future...

16:51.636 --> 16:54.264
...let's just say, you and me?
Never having sex again.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.017
- What?
- That's right! Sex is off the table!

16:57.183 --> 17:00.854
I am never having sex with you again!

17:07.068 --> 17:09.570
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?

17:12.281 --> 17:15.410
- Hey! How was lunch?
- We had a good time.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.454
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something.

17:18.621 --> 17:21.875
It would really mean a lot to me
if the baby was a boy...

17:22.041 --> 17:24.127
...that you name him after my father...

17:24.294 --> 17:26.421
...Jiminy Billy Bob.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.012
- Oh, really?
- No! Ha, ha.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.598
- You were right. That was fun.
- Ha-ha-ha.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.435
I'm gonna go finish packing.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.062
- Okay.
- Ha, ha.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.650
- So is she gonna take the test?
- No, she doesn't have to.

17:47.817 --> 17:50.153
- I found out who the father is.
- Oh, God.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.281
- It's Shovely Joe, isn't it'?
- No, it's not.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.532
How do you know?

17:54.699 --> 17:57.285
Erica didn't pay attention
in sex ed. class...

17:57.452 --> 17:59.913
...because the things she did
with that prison guy?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.165
It'd be pretty hard to make
a baby that way.

18:02.332 --> 18:06.669
Oh, God, what was it? The thing we
hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?

18:09.005 --> 18:10.673
The thing we never do.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.968
Shovely Joe.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.231
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right. Ahem.

18:34.864 --> 18:39.536
- I'm sorry, what's going on?
- Dude, come on, French it up.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.580
Joey, do you speak French?

18:49.838 --> 18:52.006
You know what?
I think this audition is over.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.635
Uh, excuse me?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.805
Uh, I am Régine Phalange.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.935
Uh, I was passing by when
I heard this man speaking...

19:04.102 --> 19:10.191
...the regional dialect of my
French town of Estée Lauder.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.987
You really think this man
is speaking French?

19:43.892 --> 19:46.561
Good job, little buddy.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.274
That was some really good French.

19:51.441 --> 19:54.277
But I think we're gonna go
with someone else for the part.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.947
- Oh, all right, but my French was good?
- It was great.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.532
Oh, ha, ha, see?

20:09.792 --> 20:12.629
- Emma's down for the night.
- Oh, good.

20:12.795 --> 20:16.674
- So, uh, I guess I'm gonna take oh'.
- Okay.

20:16.841 --> 20:19.594
Hey, listen, uh, just before you go...

20:19.761 --> 20:22.013
I just wanna say thank you
for coming with me.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.598
Oh, no problem.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.768
And also, you know, I, uh...

20:26.935 --> 20:31.689
I was thinking about what you said, uh,
you know, about the whole sex thing...

20:31.856 --> 20:35.360
Probably not a great idea
to go down that road again.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.905
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.407
It's a shame, though.
When we did it, it was pretty good.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.953
Yeah.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.455
Yeah, that's true.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.792
Hey, um, do you remember
that one really great time?

20:50.959 --> 20:52.752
- Oh, yeah!
- You know?

20:52.919 --> 20:56.172
- It was Valentine's Day.
- It was your birthday.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.550
Oh, yeah.

21:03.054 --> 21:06.891
Well, I guess that's all
in the past now.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.686
Mm-hm.

21:12.272 --> 21:15.108
- Not even one more time.
- Not even once.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.945
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it...

21:19.112 --> 21:20.989
- ...really bad.
- That's what we decided.

21:21.155 --> 21:24.075
Yeah, ha, ha, that's right.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.580
- It's kind of hard, though. You know?
- Yeah.

21:29.747 --> 21:34.085
When two people have a connection,
you know, that's...

21:34.544 --> 21:36.754
Just seems like...

21:36.921 --> 21:38.423
...such a...

21:38.589 --> 21:40.550
...waste.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.221
I hate waste.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.187
- Ross?
- Yes?

21:53.521 --> 21:55.189
Just so you know...

21:56.190 --> 21:58.026
...with us...

21:58.401 --> 22:00.737
...it's never off the table.

22:11.414 --> 22:14.667
Damn it, it's never off the table.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.846
- Okay, can you really tap-dance?
- No.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.057
It's off the résumé.

22:29.932 --> 22:32.268
- Archery?
- No.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.730
- Horseback riding?
- Would fall off a lot.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.734
You can drink a gallon of milk
in 10 seconds?

22:39.901 --> 22:41.527
That I can do.

22:41.861 --> 22:45.531
Come on, you can drink
a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?

22:45.698 --> 22:47.617
All right, watch me.

22:49.660 --> 22:54.207
- Okay, you time me, ready?
- Ready, go!

23:24.529 --> 23:25.571
You did it!
