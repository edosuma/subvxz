WEBVTT

00:13.352 --> 00:16.146
All right, grab all the cash
from the register and safe...

00:16.312 --> 00:17.523
...but don't eat nothing.

00:17.689 --> 00:19.191
Mrs. M's my great-auntie.

00:21.026 --> 00:23.987
So you'll rob the piggy bank,
but won't touch the cookie jar?

00:24.154 --> 00:26.240
You must qualify
for Nephew of the Year.

00:26.406 --> 00:29.243
- Twisted division.
- Spider-Man. Get him.

00:29.576 --> 00:32.412
"Spider-Man. Get him."
Really? Is that the best you got?

00:32.579 --> 00:35.582
I go to all this trouble to turn you
into famous Spider-perps.

00:35.749 --> 00:38.835
The least you could do
is keep things interesting. I always do.

00:46.885 --> 00:49.304
I'm really quite creative.

01:11.493 --> 01:13.495
Now, let's review that to-do list.

01:13.662 --> 01:15.080
Stopped the crime: Check.

01:15.539 --> 01:19.751
Took pictures of my web-slinging self
to win the <i>Daily</i> Bugle's photo contest:

01:19.918 --> 01:21.044
Check, check.

01:23.005 --> 01:25.841
Hightail it home before curfew:
Check, check, check.

01:26.008 --> 01:29.761
Yup, for once,
I'm making all the right moves.

01:29.928 --> 01:31.013
All the smart choices.

01:44.693 --> 01:47.446
- Curt?
- Yeah. Right there, hon.

03:18.537 --> 03:20.497
All these bills.

03:20.664 --> 03:23.959
I'm home.
And before 10, thank you very much.

03:24.334 --> 03:27.003
Peter, making your curfew
with only seconds to spare...

03:27.170 --> 03:29.005
...is hardly cause for celebration.

03:29.172 --> 03:30.924
Aunt May, don't stress, okay?

03:31.091 --> 03:33.343
I know you've been struggling
to make ends meet.

03:33.677 --> 03:36.930
But that's all about to change.
Believe me.

03:41.518 --> 03:42.978
Billy's reading about lizards?

03:43.270 --> 03:45.856
He wanted to know
about those new skinks at the lab.

03:47.107 --> 03:48.525
He's a Connors.

03:48.692 --> 03:51.194
Come on, let's go to bed.

04:01.621 --> 04:05.792
Yup, Aunt May's troubles are over.
That <i>Bugle</i> prize money is as good as--

04:05.959 --> 04:08.462
No. The window caught the flash.

04:09.171 --> 04:10.338
<i>They're all useless.</i>

04:30.233 --> 04:32.569
Curt, what is it?

04:42.245 --> 04:44.539
I can't believe it.

04:45.916 --> 04:47.042
It worked.

04:47.209 --> 04:49.044
What worked? What did you--?

04:49.211 --> 04:52.881
Curt, tell me you didn't use
that lizard DNA formula.

04:53.048 --> 04:54.758
Some lizards regenerate lost limbs.

04:54.925 --> 04:57.427
And some lizards stick to walls
and eat raw meat.

04:57.636 --> 05:00.597
- That doesn't mean you risk your life--
- Look at the results.

05:00.764 --> 05:04.434
Don't you see what this means?
To me? To the world?

05:04.643 --> 05:07.771
- We can literally heal millions.
- Mom?

05:07.938 --> 05:09.064
Dad?

05:09.898 --> 05:13.652
- Hey, partner.
- Whoa, Dad, your arm.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.292
There's Parker.

05:29.960 --> 05:32.963
This is perfect.
By the time we're through...

05:33.129 --> 05:36.299
...he'll be a shivering, wet rat.
I mean, more than usual.

05:39.928 --> 05:42.055
Dude, you missed.

05:42.222 --> 05:44.307
Dumb luck. Jerk's lousy with it.

05:44.933 --> 05:45.976
Hey, Puny Parker.

05:52.649 --> 05:54.401
What?

05:55.735 --> 05:56.820
Check out Parker.

05:56.987 --> 05:59.322
- They didn't nail him once.
- How'd he do that?

05:59.906 --> 06:02.784
<i>Oh, secret identities reek.</i>

06:02.951 --> 06:05.954
Come on, quarterback,
can't you complete a single--?

06:08.999 --> 06:10.625
Yeah.

06:12.752 --> 06:14.588
Move, geekette, or you're next.

06:14.754 --> 06:16.923
Please, you haven't got the game.

06:17.090 --> 06:20.510
If you could hit a target,
would we have lost to Bronx Tech?

06:20.677 --> 06:22.596
You choked like a cat with a hairball.

06:25.098 --> 06:26.141
Yeah.

06:26.349 --> 06:29.185
Dude, you want some aloe vera
for that burn?

06:29.352 --> 06:31.771
Come on, Einsteins.

06:41.031 --> 06:43.867
Anything's better
than just standing there and taking it.

06:44.034 --> 06:45.285
Excuse me?

06:45.452 --> 06:47.996
Standing there and taking it
is Nerd Survival 101.

06:48.163 --> 06:52.709
- Besides, I got bigger problems.
- Still no Spider-Man pictures, huh?

06:52.876 --> 06:56.129
Counting on winning that prize money
for your aunt might not be--

06:56.296 --> 06:57.714
What am I supposed to do?

06:57.881 --> 07:00.300
I never asked to be broke,
or semi-grounded...

07:00.467 --> 07:02.844
...or smart enough to be
Flash's drenching boy.

07:03.011 --> 07:04.346
You stop right there.

07:04.512 --> 07:06.890
I'm so not letting you
wish away your big brain.

07:07.057 --> 07:09.559
If it's so big,
how come it can't solve my problems?

07:09.768 --> 07:12.520
Big, but unripe.
Give it time, Cantaloupe Boy.

07:15.899 --> 07:18.234
About time.
The Connors are due back any minute.

07:18.401 --> 07:21.237
- Here, bro. We've still got cleaning--
- Save it for later.

07:21.404 --> 07:23.323
First, we celebrate.

07:23.490 --> 07:24.658
Cake.

07:24.824 --> 07:26.076
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.203
What exactly are we celebrat--?

07:28.370 --> 07:30.580
Your hand. Your right hand.

07:35.335 --> 07:36.753
You can do it. You can do it.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.713
Gotcha.

07:39.214 --> 07:40.715
- Sorry.
- What, are you kidding?

07:40.882 --> 07:43.677
Do you know how thrilled I am
to lose at arm-wrestling?

07:43.843 --> 07:46.388
Doc, this is huge.
Your lizard formula's the cure...

07:46.554 --> 07:49.349
...for, like, every lost limb
and amputation in the world.

07:49.516 --> 07:51.685
We're talking
guaranteed Nobel Prize.

07:52.268 --> 07:53.728
Slow down, Eddie.

07:53.895 --> 07:56.356
Bad enough my husband
used himself as a guinea--

07:58.608 --> 08:02.779
Billy, Eddie installed
"Space Wackos ll" on the computer.

08:02.946 --> 08:04.781
"Wackos"? Wicked.

08:04.948 --> 08:08.910
If you're gonna crank the volume,
close the door, please.

08:09.452 --> 08:11.913
- Take off your shirt, dear.
- What, are you kidding?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.415
It's freezing in here.

08:15.458 --> 08:16.751
All right.

08:28.555 --> 08:30.140
What?

08:31.599 --> 08:34.227
Lizard DNA is more primitive
than human...

08:34.394 --> 08:36.855
...and the reptilian part
of your brain is growing.

08:38.440 --> 08:44.362
It's growing. I'm regressing.
I can feel the change.

08:44.946 --> 08:46.364
Curt, please.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.950
You need to keep a clear head.

08:49.117 --> 08:53.788
No, you need to hurry.
I'm losing control.

08:56.332 --> 09:00.003
The formula creates new reptile
sequences faster than I can ID them.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.005
I don't know
how we'll knock them down.

09:02.172 --> 09:04.924
Wait, bro.
What if we work from the other end?

09:05.091 --> 09:06.801
Create a human DNA filter...

09:06.968 --> 09:10.305
...that knocks out the lizard code?
Like the noise filter on a phone.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.641
- Yeah, nice try, bro, but--
- No, wait.

09:13.808 --> 09:15.310
That could work.

09:15.477 --> 09:17.979
A gene cleanser.

09:18.146 --> 09:20.774
Yes. Yes, of course.

09:20.940 --> 09:22.692
I should've seen it before.

09:22.859 --> 09:25.195
My notes.
They'll have all the data we need.

09:25.403 --> 09:28.364
So it'll remove any nonhuman DNA.

09:28.531 --> 09:30.700
<i>Even spider.</i>

09:36.831 --> 09:39.876
Hey, Billy.
How long were you listening?

09:40.043 --> 09:42.712
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- Okay.

09:42.921 --> 09:44.839
What do you wanna talk about?

09:45.965 --> 09:48.843
The book says some lizards lay
hundreds of eggs...

09:49.010 --> 09:50.345
...and never see them hatch.

09:51.554 --> 09:54.390
Most of the babies
get eaten by predators.

09:54.557 --> 09:56.309
And the parents don't even care...

09:56.935 --> 09:59.729
...because they've only got
lizard brains.

09:59.938 --> 10:02.148
Billy, trust me.

10:02.315 --> 10:04.317
Your dad will always care about you.

10:04.734 --> 10:07.904
Even if he turns into a monster?

10:21.251 --> 10:22.961
Curt.

10:23.837 --> 10:29.551
I've made a terrible mistake.

10:57.162 --> 10:58.413
Curt.

10:58.580 --> 11:00.039
Curt, do you recognize me?

11:07.463 --> 11:09.883
Doc, stop. We just wanna--

11:26.065 --> 11:27.901
- Eddie.
- Finish the gene cleanser.

11:28.067 --> 11:30.904
I'll follow the doc
and call in with a location.

11:31.070 --> 11:34.616
I should get going too. Aunt May will
ground me if I'm not home by 10.

11:34.782 --> 11:37.452
Pete, you can't leave now.
We have to help.

11:37.619 --> 11:38.953
Well, <i>I</i> just--

11:39.120 --> 11:40.580
I can't be late. She worries.

11:42.373 --> 11:43.541
Peter, wait.

11:44.959 --> 11:47.212
- How could he just...?
- I guess...

11:47.378 --> 11:48.713
I guess he's scared.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.300
First Electro, now this.
It's overwhelming.

11:52.634 --> 11:55.637
- And he's only 16.
- I'm 16.

11:56.429 --> 12:00.099
I know. And thank you.

12:09.776 --> 12:12.946
Now, if I were a 6'5" lizard
instead of a 5'6" spider...

12:13.112 --> 12:14.614
...where would I hide?

12:18.284 --> 12:20.370
What is that thing?

12:20.536 --> 12:23.081
Duh, underground.

12:28.086 --> 12:31.214
Don't panic. Just head for the exit.

12:41.683 --> 12:44.060
Sorry, pal, no eating in the subway.

12:54.696 --> 12:58.366
Dr. Connors, we have to get you
back to the lab, understand?

12:58.533 --> 13:00.285
Dr. C, you in there?

13:01.160 --> 13:03.288
Okay, maybe not.

13:04.998 --> 13:07.083
Can you say halitosis?

13:08.001 --> 13:10.461
I knew that you could.

13:15.508 --> 13:19.304
Okay, doc, this is gonna hurt me
more than it hurts you.

13:22.056 --> 13:25.476
Oh, yeah.
Definitely hurts me more than you.

13:30.273 --> 13:32.734
Watch that third rail, web-head.

13:35.486 --> 13:39.073
Okay, Lizzie. Where'd you get to now?

13:39.240 --> 13:41.159
Hey, wall-crawling's my shtick.

13:41.617 --> 13:44.120
Hey, you start spinning a web
and I'll sue.

13:49.459 --> 13:51.252
<i>Number 2 Express to the Bronx.</i>

13:51.419 --> 13:54.380
<i>Please stand clear
of the closing doors.</i>

13:55.256 --> 13:56.841
Anyone get the number of that--?

14:28.998 --> 14:30.541
What?

15:08.287 --> 15:11.290
Okay, you big, dumb gecko.

15:22.510 --> 15:24.887
So much for plan A.

15:28.850 --> 15:30.017
We're done?

15:30.184 --> 15:32.603
I think so.
It all squares with Curt's research.

15:32.770 --> 15:37.650
There's only one way to test it,
and since Curt's hide is so thick...

15:37.817 --> 15:39.694
...we'll have to find a way
to make him.

15:39.861 --> 15:42.697
Maybe by asking for help
from a guy in a spider onesie?

15:42.864 --> 15:44.031
- Spider-Man.
- Spider-Man.

15:44.198 --> 15:47.076
- I get that reaction a lot.
- How did you know we needed you?

15:47.243 --> 15:49.787
My spider-sense was tingling?

15:51.706 --> 15:55.293
- Hello?
- It's me. He's at the Bronx Zoo.

15:57.795 --> 16:00.423
Tell your friend to stay clear
of the Lizard.

16:00.965 --> 16:02.133
I'm on my way.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.218
- Was that--?
- Our local hero.

16:04.385 --> 16:06.220
He'll be there. I'll be right behind.

16:06.387 --> 16:09.390
- Gwen, can you stay with Billy?
- Of course.

16:11.893 --> 16:13.769
Dr. Connors.

16:26.073 --> 16:27.742
I get that reaction a lot too.

16:27.909 --> 16:30.411
I think he's in there
with the other creepy-crawlies.

16:30.578 --> 16:32.246
Must've smelled them or something.

16:32.413 --> 16:34.081
Good. Stay put.

16:39.629 --> 16:43.674
Like a sauna in here.
And me without my Spidey trunks.

16:50.473 --> 16:52.183
Gotcha.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.894
Oh, perfect.

16:55.061 --> 16:56.687
In-laws.

17:37.144 --> 17:38.813
I thought I told you to stay put.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.982
- You're complaining?
- No way, bro--

17:41.315 --> 17:43.985
Guy. Look, we need a new strategy.

17:44.151 --> 17:45.987
Lizzie's not
in a medicine-taking mood.

17:46.153 --> 17:49.490
Not when he's so enjoying
his play date in the heated pool.

17:49.657 --> 17:51.325
Wait a minute.

17:53.244 --> 17:54.537
The fake swamp was heated...

17:54.745 --> 17:58.165
...but dunk a cold-blooded reptile
in freezing water and he'll slow up.

17:58.332 --> 17:59.959
Right. Slow enough for someone...

18:00.126 --> 18:02.545
...to force a little gene cleanser
down his throat.

18:02.753 --> 18:06.299
But first you need to get him here
with lizard bait.

18:06.465 --> 18:09.343
- Don't even think about--
- My choice. Try to stop me.

18:09.510 --> 18:10.886
I'm impressed, bro.

18:16.350 --> 18:17.560
Okay, prep time.

18:17.768 --> 18:20.896
First, make sure the polar bears
don't take a midnight swim.

18:23.274 --> 18:27.528
Check. Next, find the perfect spot
to bounce Lizard into the drink.

18:27.695 --> 18:29.155
Check, check.

18:29.322 --> 18:31.032
Perfect angle.

18:42.043 --> 18:44.837
<i>And now for the crucial element
of surprise.</i>

19:02.521 --> 19:04.190
Dad, stop!

19:04.357 --> 19:09.111
You don't have to be a lizard.
You're still my dad.

19:20.414 --> 19:25.252
- Did you skateboard here?
- I took a cab, duh.

19:56.992 --> 19:58.994
Brought you a present, Lizzie.

19:59.161 --> 20:02.456
Gene cleanser. Guaranteed to remove
your toughest stains.

20:02.623 --> 20:05.584
Grease, mustard, even lizard DNA.

20:26.147 --> 20:27.440
Pictures and everything.

20:27.940 --> 20:29.859
But who could've taken these?

20:30.025 --> 20:31.318
Check the byline.

20:35.281 --> 20:37.199
Did you see?
There's no shots of Billy...

20:37.408 --> 20:39.827
...or Dr. Connors
to prove that he was the Lizard.

20:40.161 --> 20:41.662
And that's supposed to--

20:41.829 --> 20:46.000
Bro, you ditched the antidote effort
to win a contest.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.127
Eddie, it's all right.

20:48.669 --> 20:54.842
Besides, I'm not exactly in a position
to throw stones.

20:56.010 --> 20:59.472
Peter, you're young.
And faced with difficult choices...

20:59.638 --> 21:01.724
...young people sometimes
make mistakes.

21:01.932 --> 21:04.727
- Thanks for understanding, I--
- I understand you.

21:04.935 --> 21:06.061
But I can't trust you.

21:06.479 --> 21:07.688
You're fired.

21:31.712 --> 21:35.925
<i>I never asked to be Spider-Man.
And I never asked for these powers.</i>

21:36.091 --> 21:38.260
<i>I never knew it would mean
a bashed up hand...</i>

21:38.469 --> 21:43.766
<i>...a hard 9 p.m. curfew, no job
and friends who all think I'm scum.</i>

21:43.974 --> 21:45.935
<i>It was all just</i> a <i>twist of fate.</i>

21:46.101 --> 21:49.522
<i>Bad luck. A random bug bite.</i>

21:50.606 --> 21:52.525
<i>Easiest decision I ever made.</i>

22:01.575 --> 22:04.537
<i>Except... Except I saved them.</i>

22:09.124 --> 22:12.127
<i>Spider-Man's no magic wand,
but thanks to the web-head...</i>

22:12.294 --> 22:15.214
<i>...Curt's cured,
and Billy gets his father back.</i>

22:15.381 --> 22:17.216
<i>So what if nobody threw a parade?</i>

22:19.718 --> 22:21.929
<i>Spidey stays
because Spidey's needed.</i>

22:22.096 --> 22:24.223
<i>For now, anyway.</i>
