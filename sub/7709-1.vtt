WEBVTT

00:32.566 --> 00:33.534
All right, Jim,

00:33.567 --> 00:36.304
your quarterlies
look very good.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.571
How are things going
at the library?

00:37.605 --> 00:40.074
Oh, I told you.
I couldn't close it, so...

00:40.108 --> 00:43.577
So you've come
to the master for guidance?

00:43.611 --> 00:46.180
[Chinese accent]
Is this what you're saying,
Grasshopper?

00:46.214 --> 00:47.815
Uh, actually,
you called me in here.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.383
But, yeah.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.120
All right, well, let me
show you how it's done.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.588
Yes, I'd like to speak
to your office manager, please.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.757
Yes, hello.
This is Michael Scott.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.459
I am the Regional Manager

00:58.492 --> 01:00.628
of Dunder Mifflin
paper products.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.697
Just wanted to talk to you
manager a manager.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.868
All right, done deal!

01:07.901 --> 01:09.437
[Irish accent]
Thank you very much, sir!

01:09.470 --> 01:13.107
You're gentleman
and a scholar.

01:13.141 --> 01:14.708
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.277
Okay.
I'm sorry.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.279
My mistake.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.313
[clears throat]

01:19.347 --> 01:21.582
That was a woman
I was talking to.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.552
So.
She had a very low voice.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.620
Probably a smoker.

01:26.654 --> 01:30.324
So...
[clears throat]

01:30.358 --> 01:31.592
So that's the way it's done.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.894
I've, uh, I've been
at Dunder Mifflin

01:33.927 --> 01:35.296
for 12 years.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.731
The last four
as regional manager.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.768
Uh, if you wanna
come through here.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.903
Ah, see, we have
the entire floor.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.639
So this is my kingdom,
far as the eye can see.

01:45.673 --> 01:48.309
Ah, this
is our receptionist Pam.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.178
[imitating Bam-Bam]
Pam! Pam, Pam!

01:50.211 --> 01:51.412
Pam Beasley.

01:51.445 --> 01:55.149
Uh, Pam has been with us,
um...for...forever.

01:55.183 --> 01:56.250
Right, Pam?

01:56.284 --> 01:57.318
Well, I don't know.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.286
If you think
she's cute now,

01:58.319 --> 01:59.787
you should have seen her
a couple of years ago.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.289
Reow, reow.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.290
What?

02:02.323 --> 02:03.624
Uh, any messages?

02:03.657 --> 02:06.694
Um...yeah.
Just a fax.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.629
Oh.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.563
Pam, this is from corporate.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.265
How many times
have I told you
I know...

02:11.299 --> 02:12.566
that there's
a special filing cabinet

02:12.600 --> 02:13.867
for things from corporate?

02:13.901 --> 02:14.902
You haven't told me--

02:14.935 --> 02:16.270
It's called
the wastepaper basket!

02:16.304 --> 02:18.606
[bawdy laugh]

02:18.639 --> 02:21.175
Look at that!

02:21.209 --> 02:22.710
Oh, look at that face.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.246
People say
I am the best boss.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.614
They go,

02:26.647 --> 02:28.349
"God, we've never worked
in a place like this before.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.251
"You're hilarious.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.420
And you get the best
out of us."

02:32.453 --> 02:34.955
Um...

02:34.988 --> 02:38.659
I think that
pretty much sums it up.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.794
I found it at Spencer Gifts.

02:43.731 --> 02:47.535
* Shall I play for you

02:47.568 --> 02:49.670
* Pa rum pa pum pum

02:49.703 --> 02:53.374
[imitating drums]

02:53.407 --> 02:56.344
* I have no gifts for you

02:56.377 --> 02:58.246
* Pa rum pa pum pum

02:58.279 --> 03:00.548
[imitating drums]

03:00.581 --> 03:03.917
My job is to speak to clients,
um, on the phone,

03:03.951 --> 03:07.555
about...
uh, quantities

03:07.588 --> 03:12.793
and, uh, type of...
copier paper.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.763
You know, whether
we can supply it to them,

03:15.796 --> 03:18.799
whether they can, uh...

03:18.832 --> 03:19.833
pay for it.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.802
And, um...

03:21.835 --> 03:24.872
[clicks tongue]

03:24.905 --> 03:28.742
I'm--I'm boring myself
just talking about this.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.582
Wassuuuup?

03:34.615 --> 03:35.883
Wassuuuup?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.751
I still love that
after seven years.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.820
Whasuuuup?

03:39.853 --> 03:42.490
Whasuuuup?

03:42.523 --> 03:44.258
Whasuuuuuuuuuup?

03:45.893 --> 03:46.860
Whassup?

03:46.894 --> 03:47.861
Oh, wow.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.669
[groans]

03:59.440 --> 04:00.841
What?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.676
Nothin'.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.044
Okay, all right.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.513
See you later.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.481
All right.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.849
Take care.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.384
Back to work!

04:14.855 --> 04:16.690
(woman)
Just try to reach him
sometime today.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.759
Um, I don't know,
just before lunch.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.894
That would be great.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.563
(Michael)
Corporate really doesn't
interfere with me at all.

04:22.596 --> 04:23.631
Jan Levenson-Gould--

04:23.664 --> 04:25.333
Jan! Hello!

04:25.366 --> 04:27.835
I call her
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.903
Right?
Not to her face, because, uh--

04:29.937 --> 04:32.740
Well, not because
I'm scared of her.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.542
Because I'm not.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.511
But, um, yeah.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.613
All right, was there anything
you wanted to add to the agenda?

04:39.647 --> 04:43.817
Mmm...me no get
an agenda.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.653
I'm sor--What?
I'm sorry?

04:45.686 --> 04:46.887
I didn't get
any agenda.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.889
Well, I faxed one over
to you this morning.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.924
Really? 'Cause it didn't,
uh, I didn't--

04:50.958 --> 04:53.026
Did we get a fax
this morning?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.862
Uh, yeah, the one--

04:54.895 --> 04:58.632
Then why--why isn't
it in my hand?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.768
Because a company runs
on efficiency of communication.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.703
Right? Just...
[imitates gun firing]

05:02.736 --> 05:04.405
Um, so what's the problem,
Pam?

05:04.438 --> 05:07.040
Why didn't, uh,
why didn't I get it?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.343
You put it
in the garbage can

05:09.377 --> 05:11.379
that was a special
filing cabinet.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.617
Yeah!
Uh, that was a joke.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.951
That was a joke
that, uh,

05:17.985 --> 05:19.787
was actually
my brother's.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.788
And it was--
[laughs]

05:20.821 --> 05:21.855
it was supposed
to be with bills,

05:21.889 --> 05:23.824
and it doesn't
work great with faxes.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.025
Do you wanna
look at mine?
Yeah.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.827
Yeah, I would.
Thank you.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.896
Okay, since
the last meeting,

05:28.929 --> 05:30.598
Alan and the board
have decided

05:30.631 --> 05:32.400
that we can't justify
a Scranton branch

05:32.433 --> 05:33.601
and a Stanford branch.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.768
Oh, okay.

05:34.802 --> 05:35.836
Michael, don't panic--

05:35.869 --> 05:36.970
No, no, no, no.
This is good.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.772
This is good.
This is fine, excellent.

05:38.806 --> 05:39.607
Michael, listen,
okay, don't panic.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.741
Although alarm bells
are kinda going

05:40.774 --> 05:43.076
ringy dingy dingy!
We haven't made
any decisions yet.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.478
I've spoken to Josh
in Stanford.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.879
I've told him
the same as you,

05:45.913 --> 05:47.815
and it's up to either
you or him to convince me

05:47.848 --> 05:48.882
that your branch
can incorporate the other.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.150
Okay, no problem.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.985
This does, however, mean that
there's going to be downsizing.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.887
Me no wanna
hear that, Jan.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.123
Because downsizing
is a bitch.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.726
It is a real bitch.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.962
And I wouldn't wish that
on Josh's men.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.831
I certainly wouldn't
wish it on my men.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.600
Or women,
present company excluded.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.968
Sorry, uh...

06:08.001 --> 06:11.138
Is Josh concerned
about downsizing, himself?

06:11.171 --> 06:12.573
Not downsizing himself,

06:12.606 --> 06:13.941
but is he concerned about
downsizing?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.112
Ha ha ha ha!

06:19.146 --> 06:21.014
Question: How long
do we have to act--

06:21.048 --> 06:23.083
[telephone rings]

06:23.116 --> 06:25.553
Oh, Todd Packer.
Terrific rep.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.687
Do you mind
if I take it?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.855
Go right ahead.

06:27.888 --> 06:28.722
Packman.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.190
(Todd)
Hey, you big queen!

06:30.223 --> 06:31.992
Oh, that's not...
appropriate.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.828
Hey, is old Godzillary
coming in today?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.096
Um, I don't know.
I don't know what you mean.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.433
Look, I've been meaning
to ask her one question.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.435
Does the carpet
match the drapes?

06:41.469 --> 06:42.903
Oh, my God.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.171
Ohh!

06:44.204 --> 06:46.974
That's...horrifying.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.943
And horrible.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.846
Horrible person.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.883
So do you think we could
keep a lid on this for now?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.918
I don't wanna worry people
unnecessarily.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.919
No, absolutely.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.220
Under this regime,

07:00.253 --> 07:01.889
it will not
leave this office.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.691
Just...like that.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.859
[whispering]
So what does downsizing
actually mean?

07:05.893 --> 07:06.960
Well...

07:06.994 --> 07:08.996
[whispering]
You guys gotta update
your resumes,

07:09.029 --> 07:09.997
just like I'm doing.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.765
I bet it's gonna be me.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.001
It's probably gonna be me.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.603
Yeah, it'll be you.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.004
I have an important
question for you.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.238
Yes?

07:18.271 --> 07:21.108
[laughing]
Um, are you going to Angela's
cat party on Sunday?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.844
Yeah. Stop.
That is ridiculous.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.679
(Michael)
Am I gonna tell them?
No, I'm not going to tell them.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.847
I don't see
the point of that.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.982
As a doctor, you would not
tell a patient

07:29.016 --> 07:30.751
if they had cancer.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.852
Hey!

07:31.885 --> 07:33.621
Hey!
This is Mr. Scott.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.589
Guilty!
Guilty as charged.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.024
Ryan Howard
from the temp agency.

07:37.057 --> 07:37.825
Uh-huh.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.560
Daniqua sent me down
to start today.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.962
Howard, like Moe Howard,
Three Stooges.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.797
Watch this, this is Moe.

07:43.831 --> 07:44.998
Nyuck! Nyuck! Nyuck!
Nyuck! Nyuck!

07:45.032 --> 07:47.735
Meeeeh!
Ha ha!

07:47.768 --> 07:49.169
Ah, right here.
Three Stooges.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.004
High five!
Oh, Pam.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.040
It's a guy thing, Pam.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.891
(Pam)
I don't think it would be

08:10.924 --> 08:12.893
the worst thing
if they let me go.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.195
Because then I might--

08:15.228 --> 08:16.997
I just, I don't think
it's many little girls' dream

08:17.030 --> 08:19.600
to be a receptionist.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.702
Um, I like to do
illustrations.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.205
Um, mostly watercolor.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.908
A few oil pencil.
Um...

08:27.941 --> 08:31.979
Jim thinks
they're good.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.882
Sure. Uh, Mr. Davis,
let me call you right back.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.684
Yeah, something just came up.
Two minutes.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.852
Thank you very much.

08:38.886 --> 08:39.953
Dwight,
what are you doing?

08:39.987 --> 08:41.855
What?
What are you doing?

08:41.889 --> 08:43.691
Just clearing my desk.
I can't concentrate.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.725
It's not on your desk.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.726
It's overlapping.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.595
It's all spilling
over the edge.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.630
One word, two syllables:
demarcation.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.591
(Dwight)
Downsizing?

09:17.625 --> 09:19.092
Yeah, I have
no problem with that.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.228
I have been
recommending downsizing

09:21.261 --> 09:23.163
since I first got here.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.265
I even brought it up
in my interview.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.968
I say bring it on.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.971
(Pam)
You just still have
these messages from yesterday.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.006
Relax, everything's
under control.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.108
Uh, yeah.
There we go, yeah.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.944
Oh, that's important.
Rrrright.

09:36.977 --> 09:41.114
Oh, this is so important
I should run to answer it.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.783
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

09:42.816 --> 09:45.018
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

09:45.052 --> 09:47.120
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

09:47.154 --> 09:49.356
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

09:49.389 --> 09:51.224
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

09:51.258 --> 09:54.027
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

09:54.061 --> 09:57.064
Sha-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta!

10:00.834 --> 10:01.835
What?

10:01.869 --> 10:03.170
Come on!

10:03.203 --> 10:04.972
Six Million Dollar Man!

10:05.005 --> 10:05.973
Steve Austin!

10:06.006 --> 10:08.341
Actually, that would be
a good salary for me,

10:08.375 --> 10:09.677
don't you think?

10:09.710 --> 10:10.778
$6 million?

10:10.811 --> 10:13.246
Memo to Jan:
I deserve a raise.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.915
Don't we all?

10:14.948 --> 10:16.249
I'm sorry?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.952
It's nothing.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.889
If you're unhappy
with your compensation,

10:21.922 --> 10:24.057
maybe you should
take it up with H.R.

10:24.091 --> 10:24.958
Okay?

10:24.992 --> 10:26.727
Not today, okay?

10:26.760 --> 10:29.062
Pam, just...
be professional.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.701
[sighs]

10:33.734 --> 10:36.069
(Michael)
I think I'm
a role model here.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.871
I think I garner
people's respect.

10:37.905 --> 10:40.741
Attention all Dunder Mifflin
employees, please.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.175
We have a meeting
in the conference room

10:42.209 --> 10:43.744
A.S.A.P.

10:43.777 --> 10:46.213
(Michael)
People I respect,
heroes of mine, would be...

10:46.246 --> 10:48.415
Bob Hope.

10:48.448 --> 10:53.020
Um...
Abraham Lincoln.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.455
Definitely.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.760
Bono.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.329
Uh, and probably God...

11:02.362 --> 11:05.899
would be the fourth one.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.901
And I just think
all those people

11:07.935 --> 11:11.071
really helped the world

11:11.104 --> 11:14.074
in so many ways

11:14.107 --> 11:16.844
that it's, um...

11:16.877 --> 11:18.846
it's really beyond words.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.917
[mispronouncing]
It's really incalcalacable.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.185
Now, I know there are
some rumors out there,

11:25.218 --> 11:27.054
and I just kinda wanna
set the record straight--

11:27.087 --> 11:28.922
I'm Assistant Regional Manger.
I should know first.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.223
Assistant
to the Regional Manager.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.292
Okay, um, can you
just tell me, please?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.127
Just tell me quietly.
Whisper it in my ear.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.729
I'm just about
to tell everyone.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.030
Can't you just
tell us--
Please!

11:37.064 --> 11:38.498
Okay?
Do you want me to tell them?

11:38.531 --> 11:40.167
You don't know
what it is.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.334
[chuckles]

11:41.368 --> 11:43.036
Okay, you tell them.
With my permission.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.237
I don't need--
Permission granted.
Go ahead.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.274
Corporate has
deemed it appropriate

11:47.307 --> 11:50.410
to enforce an ultimatum
upon me.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.313
And, uh, Jan is thinking
about downsizing

11:53.346 --> 11:55.348
either the Stanford branch
or this branch.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.525
Yeah, but, Michael,
what if they downsize here?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.860
Not gonna happen.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.795
It could be
out of your hands, Michael.

12:07.828 --> 12:11.198
It won't be out of my hands,
Stanley, okay?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.265
I promise you that.

12:12.299 --> 12:13.366
Oh, can you promise that?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.835
On his mother's grave.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.069
Well...

12:16.103 --> 12:17.404
No!

12:17.437 --> 12:19.439
Well, yeah,
it is a promise.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.208
And, frankly,
I'm a little bit insulted

12:21.241 --> 12:23.376
that you have to keep
asking about it.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.778
It's just
that we need to know.

12:24.812 --> 12:27.447
I-I know.
Hold on a second.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.816
I think Pam wanted
to say something.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.785
Pam, you, uh...

12:31.819 --> 12:34.287
had a look that you
wanted to ask a question

12:34.321 --> 12:36.790
just now.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.792
I was in the meeting
with Jan,

12:38.826 --> 12:40.961
and she did say
that it could be this branch

12:40.994 --> 12:42.129
that gets the axe.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.264
(Stanley)
Are you sure about that?

12:44.297 --> 12:45.532
Look, Pam...

12:45.565 --> 12:46.666
Uh, maybe
you should stick

12:46.699 --> 12:50.003
to the ongoing confidentiality
agreement of meetings.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.072
Pam, information is power.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.240
So...

12:53.273 --> 12:54.507
(Stanley)
So you can't say for sure

12:54.541 --> 12:55.976
whether it's gonna
be us or them, can you?

12:56.009 --> 12:57.010
No, no, no, no.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.378
Stanley, no.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.814
You did not see me
in there with her.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.383
I said if,
uh, if corporate

13:03.416 --> 13:05.452
wants to come in here
and interfere,

13:05.485 --> 13:07.354
then they're gonna
have to go through me.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.555
Right?

13:08.588 --> 13:10.858
You know, you can go
mess with Josh's people.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.525
But I'm the head
of this family,

13:12.559 --> 13:16.329
and you ain't gonna be
messin' with my chillun'.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.005
If I left,
what would I do with...

13:25.038 --> 13:28.475
all this useless
information in my head?

13:28.508 --> 13:33.080
You know?
Tonnage price of manila folders?

13:33.113 --> 13:35.582
Um, Pam's favorite
flavor of yogurt,

13:35.615 --> 13:37.017
which is mixed berry.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.589
Jim said mixed berries?

13:44.892 --> 13:47.627
Oh, well, yeah,
he's on to me.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.897
Um...

13:49.930 --> 13:51.965
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Watch out for this guy.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.001
Dwight Schrute
in the building.

13:54.034 --> 13:54.701
This is Ryan,
the new temp.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.003
What's up?
Nice to meet you.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.370
Introduce yourself.
Be polite.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.639
Uh, Dwight Schrute,
Assistant Regional Manager.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.942
Assistant
to the Regional Manager.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.411
So, uh, Dwight,
tell him about the Kung Fu

14:04.444 --> 14:06.446
and the car and everything.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.216
Uh, yeah, I got a '78 280Z.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.650
I bought it for 1,200,
fixed it up.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.651
It's now worth three grand.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.485
That is his profit.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.487
Yeah, uh, new engine,
suspension.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.656
I got a respray.
I got some photos.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.126
Oh! Damn it!

14:19.159 --> 14:19.960
Damn it! I--

14:19.993 --> 14:22.195
Hold on, hold on.
Judge is in session.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.931
What is the problem here?

14:23.964 --> 14:26.133
He put my stuff
in Jell-O again!

14:26.166 --> 14:28.501
[Pam laughing]

14:28.535 --> 14:29.970
That's real professional.
Thanks.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.538
This is the third time,
and it wasn't funny

14:31.571 --> 14:32.906
the first two times
either, Jim!

14:32.940 --> 14:34.141
It's okay here.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.509
Uh, but people sometimes
take advantage

14:36.543 --> 14:38.011
because it's so relaxed.

14:38.045 --> 14:41.982
I'm a volunteer sheriff's
deputy on the weekends.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.551
And you cannot
screw around there.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.619
It's sort of
one of the rules.

14:46.653 --> 14:47.620
[laughing]
What is that?

14:47.654 --> 14:48.621
That's my stapler.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.557
No, no!
Do not take it out.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.292
You have to eat it
out of there,

14:52.325 --> 14:53.961
because there are
starving people in the world,

14:53.994 --> 14:54.861
and, which I hate,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.097
and it it is a waste
of that kind of food.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.398
You know what?
You can be a witness.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.967
Can you reprimand him, please?

15:01.601 --> 15:02.936
How do you know it was me?

15:02.970 --> 15:03.803
(Dwight)
It's always you.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.238
Are you gonna
discipline him or not?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.174
Ooh, discipline, kinky!

15:07.207 --> 15:09.709
All right, here's
the deal, you guys.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.512
Thing about a practical joke
is that you have to know

15:12.545 --> 15:14.948
when to start
as well as when to stop.

15:14.982 --> 15:15.983
And, yeah,

15:16.016 --> 15:18.418
Jim, now is the time

15:18.451 --> 15:21.154
to stop putting
Dwight's personal effects

15:21.188 --> 15:23.656
into Jell-O.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.092
[clears throat]
Okay.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.960
Dwight, I'm sorry,
because...

15:26.994 --> 15:29.963
I have always been
your biggest flan.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.031
[laughs]

15:31.064 --> 15:33.200
Ho ho ho, nice!

15:33.233 --> 15:34.968
That's the way
it is around here.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.703
It just kind of goes
round and round and round.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.006
You, uh, you should have
put him in "custardy."

15:39.039 --> 15:40.974
Oh, hey!
Yes!

15:41.008 --> 15:43.376
New guy!
And he scores.

15:43.410 --> 15:44.511
Okay, that's great.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.479
I guess what I'm
most concerned with

15:46.513 --> 15:49.116
is damage
to company property.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.051
That's all.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.123
Pudding.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.690
Putting.

15:57.724 --> 16:01.661
I'm trying to think
what other dessert to do.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.363
[laughs]

16:03.396 --> 16:05.065
Do you like going out

16:05.098 --> 16:07.000
at the end of the week
for a drink?

16:07.034 --> 16:08.168
Yeah.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.203
Well, that's why
we're all going out.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.571
So that we can have
an end-of-the-week drink.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.672
So when are we going out?

16:12.705 --> 16:14.241
I don't know.
Tonight, hopefully.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.408
Okay, yeah.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.079
Hey, man.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.080
Hey!
What's going on?

16:20.113 --> 16:21.081
Hi, baby.
Hey.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.116
Uh, Roy is my fiancé.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.053
We've been engaged
about, um...

16:26.086 --> 16:27.220
about three years.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.057
And, uh, we were supposed
to get married in September,

16:30.090 --> 16:33.326
but I think we're gonna
get married in the spring.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.663
Do you mind if I go out
for a drink with these guys?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.198
Uh, no, no,
come on.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.200
Let's get out of here,
go home.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.103
Okay, um, I'm gonna be
a few minutes, though.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.272
It's only 20 past 5:00.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.140
I still have
to do my faxes.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.047
You know what?
You should come with us.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.048
Because, you know,
we're all going out,

16:55.082 --> 16:57.117
and it could be
a good chance for you to...

16:57.150 --> 16:59.086
see what people are like
outside of the office.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.088
You know, I think
it could be fun.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.155
No, it sounds good.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.290
Oh, no.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.524
Seriously,
we gotta get going.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.159
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:14.701 --> 17:19.739
Um...what's in the--
what's in the bag?

17:19.772 --> 17:21.241
Just tell her
I'll talk to her later.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.176
No, definitely.
All right, dude, awesome.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.477
Will do.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.582
(Jim)
Do I think

17:29.616 --> 17:32.352
I'll be invited
to the wedding?

17:39.426 --> 17:42.762
So, uh, have you
felt a vibe yet?

17:42.795 --> 17:44.464
We work hard,
we play hard.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.666
Sometimes we play hard
when we should be working hard.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.135
Right?

17:48.168 --> 17:51.338
Um, I guess the atmosphere
that I've created here

17:51.371 --> 17:53.340
is that I'm a friend first

17:53.373 --> 17:55.242
and a boss second.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.643
Probably, uh--
[knock on door]

17:56.676 --> 17:57.777
Entertainer third.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.747
Just a second!
Right?

18:00.780 --> 18:03.316
Oh, hey, do you, uh,

18:03.350 --> 18:05.285
do you like
The Jamie Kennedy Experiment?

18:05.318 --> 18:06.886
Yeah.
Punk'd and all
that kind of stuff?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.355
Okay, um...

18:08.388 --> 18:09.589
you are gonna
be my accomplice.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.890
Just go along
with it, okay?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.425
All right.
Just follow my lead.

18:12.459 --> 18:14.427
Don't pimp me, all right?
Come in!

18:14.461 --> 18:17.430
So, uh, corporate just
said that I don't want to--
You got a fax.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.865
Oh, thank you, Pam.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.268
Pam, can you come in here
for a sec?

18:21.301 --> 18:22.502
Just have a seat.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.770
I was gonna
call you in anyway.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.206
Um, you know Ryan.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.475
Um, as you know,

18:28.508 --> 18:30.610
there's going to be
downsizing.

18:30.643 --> 18:35.548
And you have made
my life so much easier

18:35.582 --> 18:39.919
in that I am going
to have to let you go first.

18:39.952 --> 18:42.222
What? Why?

18:42.255 --> 18:43.923
Why?
Well, theft.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.292
And stealing.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.293
Stealing?

18:46.326 --> 18:47.394
Mm-hmm.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.463
Um, what am I supposed
to have stolen?

18:50.497 --> 18:52.165
Post-it notes.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.700
Post-it notes?
Yeah.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.568
What are those worth,
like, 50 cents?

18:55.602 --> 18:56.669
50 cents, yeah.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.272
You steal 1,000 Post-It notes
at 50 cents apiece,

18:59.306 --> 19:02.642
and, you know, you've
made a profit...margin.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.944
You know, gonna run us
out of business, Pam.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.146
Are you serious?

19:08.281 --> 19:09.916
Yeah, I, um...

19:09.949 --> 19:12.752
Oh, my--
I can't believe this.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.655
I mean, I've never even
stolen as much as a paper clip,

19:15.688 --> 19:17.957
and now you're firing me.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.327
And the best thing about it
is that, uh,

19:20.360 --> 19:24.231
we're not gonna have
to give you any severance pay.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.967
Because that is
gross misconduct, and, uh...

19:28.000 --> 19:31.304
So just clean out your desk.
I'm sorry.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.312
[sniffling]

19:48.020 --> 19:51.258
You've been "Xed," punk!

19:51.291 --> 19:52.725
Surprise!
It's a joke!

19:52.759 --> 19:54.294
We were joking around!

19:54.327 --> 19:55.228
[laughs]
See?

19:55.262 --> 19:56.796
Okay, he was in on it.

19:56.829 --> 19:57.997
He was my accomplice.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.601
And it was just kind of
a morale booster thing.

20:01.634 --> 20:05.272
And we were showing
the new guy around, kind of--

20:05.305 --> 20:07.340
kind of giving him
the feel of the place.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.676
So you sh--

20:09.709 --> 20:11.978
God, you were--
We totally got you--

20:12.011 --> 20:14.314
You're a jerk!

20:14.347 --> 20:15.648
Ah, I don't know
about that.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.799
(Michael)
What is the most

20:32.832 --> 20:34.901
important thing
for a company?

20:34.934 --> 20:38.938
Is it the cash flow?
Is it the inventory?

20:38.971 --> 20:40.973
Nuh-uh.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.276
It's the people.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.578
The people.

20:45.612 --> 20:46.979
My proudest moment here

20:47.013 --> 20:50.417
was not when
I increased profits by 17%.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.919
Or when I cut expenses

20:52.952 --> 20:54.554
without losing
a single employee.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.323
No, no, no, no, no.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.359
It was a young
Guatemalan guy.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.295
First job in the country,
barely spoke English.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.531
Came to me and said,

21:04.564 --> 21:07.033
[Spanish accent]
"Mr. Scott,

21:07.066 --> 21:12.805
would you be the godfather
of my child?"

21:12.839 --> 21:15.942
Wow. Wow.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.677
Wow.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.415
Didn't work out in the end.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.283
We had to let him go.
He sucked.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.089
[sniffles]

21:30.122 --> 21:31.391
Hey.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.725
Hey.
Hi.

21:32.759 --> 21:33.693
How are you?
Good.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.429
I thought you were
going out for a drink with--

21:36.463 --> 21:37.897
Oh, no, no.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.467
Just going to, uh...

21:40.500 --> 21:42.001
How's your headache?

21:42.034 --> 21:43.336
It's better.
Thanks.
Good.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.071
Good, that's great.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.706
Is, uh--
Yeah?

21:46.739 --> 21:49.342
Um, are you, uh...

21:49.376 --> 21:50.510
Am I walking out?

21:50.543 --> 21:51.744
Yes.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.346
Yes.
Do you wanna?

21:53.380 --> 21:55.348
Yeah.
Great.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.949
Let me just--
[car horn honks]

21:56.983 --> 21:59.018
Oh, Roy.
Yeah.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.453
Listen,
have a nice weekend.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.755
Yeah, definitely.
You too.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.491
Enjoy it.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.396
[door closes]
