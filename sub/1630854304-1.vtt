WEBVTT

02:22.610 --> 02:24.144
Hey.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.380
Hey.

02:29.349 --> 02:30.618
Do you need a ride?

02:30.718 --> 02:31.485
No, I'm good.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.821
My boyfriend's picking me up.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.155
Okay.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.093
Hey, Phil.

02:39.192 --> 02:39.961
Hey, you ready?

02:40.061 --> 02:41.029
Yeah.

02:56.644 --> 03:00.114
And remember,
life is a precious gift

03:00.213 --> 03:02.650
and you have so much of it
ahead of you.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.252
If you're ever feeling lost
or hopeless,

03:05.352 --> 03:08.156
please talk to someone.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.190
This school is a safe space

03:10.290 --> 03:13.061
and the faculty's doors
are always open.

03:13.661 --> 03:17.497
Jane will remain in our hearts
now and always.

03:21.234 --> 03:22.904
It's so sad.

03:23.004 --> 03:24.237
You think she's okay?

03:24.337 --> 03:25.139
Of course not.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.007
They were best friends.

03:44.759 --> 03:46.527
Josa,
I've been loving your show.

03:46.627 --> 03:47.360
Thank you.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.261
Can't wait for the next episode.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.531
It's so great we're doing this.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.601
My co-stars and I have been
UNICEF ambassadors for a while.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.737
We actually got to visit
their emergency relief site

03:55.837 --> 03:56.871
in Honduras.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.606
It's so important.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.807
Yeah.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.877
Also, college interviewers
have been eating it up.

04:02.977 --> 04:03.711
Thanks, Josa.

04:03.811 --> 04:04.679
Thank you so much!

04:05.713 --> 04:06.981
Can I grab a cookie?

04:07.081 --> 04:08.415
-Oh yeah.
-Yeah.

04:09.751 --> 04:11.119
Why do only two
Greenwood students

04:11.219 --> 04:12.285
get into Stanford each year?

04:12.385 --> 04:13.755
Olivia, hi!

04:13.855 --> 04:14.789
How are you?

04:14.889 --> 04:16.524
Only Riya
and Alyssa got in last year.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.925
Well,
it varies from year to year,

04:18.025 --> 04:19.227
depending on the class.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.528
And only two got in
the year before that.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.497
Yes, but it's not
a steadfast rule.

04:23.598 --> 04:27.735
Look, don't get caught up
in all this quota nonsense.

04:27.835 --> 04:28.903
Okay.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.071
How many girls applied
early action this year?

04:31.404 --> 04:33.975
Olivia, you've had
a rough few months.

04:34.075 --> 04:37.879
Right now, you just need
to start focusing on yourself.

04:37.979 --> 04:41.414
Your application is strong,
you're a smart young woman,

04:41.516 --> 04:42.850
and you're gonna get in
somewhere great.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.552
Not somewhere.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.887
Stanford.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.322
Hey, welcome back.

04:50.958 --> 04:51.592
O Captain!

04:51.692 --> 04:52.226
My Captain!

04:53.594 --> 04:55.062
-Hey, Richardson.
-How you doing, Champ?

04:55.163 --> 04:56.631
-I'm good.
-Yeah?

04:56.731 --> 04:58.266
Ready to kick
some Oceanview butt?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.635
-You know it!
-Alright, let's do it.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.703
My opponent is goin'
to get up here and tell you

05:02.804 --> 05:04.639
that the only way
America can survive

05:04.739 --> 05:06.373
this competitive
global landscape

05:06.473 --> 05:07.809
is by looking inwards

05:07.909 --> 05:11.179
and cutting off all
foreign philanthropic efforts.

05:11.279 --> 05:13.480
But I'd like to remind you
that our aid,

05:13.581 --> 05:15.283
the wells we built in Somalia,

05:15.382 --> 05:17.350
the schools we set up
in Afghanistan,

05:17.450 --> 05:19.887
and the doctors we sent
to earthquake ravaged Haiti

05:19.987 --> 05:22.824
is the only thing helping us
maintain a positive image

05:22.924 --> 05:23.356
in this world.

05:26.594 --> 05:29.329
This is America,
land of the free,

05:29.429 --> 05:30.531
home of the brave,

05:30.631 --> 05:33.501
and protectors
of the disenfranchised.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.803
Let's remind everyone
that we truly believe that.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.771
Thank you.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.450
Hmm, great job in there.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.786
-Thanks.
-Yes.

05:51.886 --> 05:53.254
You're gonna have room
for another trophy?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.487
I think I can find a place.

05:54.589 --> 05:55.690
Was my second speech okay?

05:55.790 --> 05:56.858
I felt like I flubbed it
in the middle

05:56.958 --> 05:58.159
and I really didn't hit
that last--

05:58.259 --> 05:59.060
-No, you didn't!
-Hi, Mr. R!

05:59.160 --> 06:00.094
Oh, hey, Camille.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.329
Alright, great, this is perfect.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.297
I wanted to introduce you
to Olivia.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.032
She is our stellar
debate team captain.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.100
Olivia, this is Camille.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.134
Hi.

06:07.235 --> 06:08.803
It's so, so nice to meet you.

06:08.903 --> 06:10.838
She just transferred from
Fairstone High in New York

06:10.938 --> 06:13.040
and she's gonna be joining
our debate team.

06:14.008 --> 06:15.042
Yay.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.210
Yeah.

06:17.812 --> 06:18.913
Great.

06:19.013 --> 06:20.281
So I'm gonna introduce you
to the rest of the team.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.349
-Yeah?
-Yeah, sounds good.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.382
See you.

06:28.923 --> 06:29.389
Yeah.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.392
Hi, Sweetie, how was your day?

06:32.492 --> 06:33.895
It was fine.

06:33.995 --> 06:35.196
We won the tournament.

06:35.296 --> 06:35.963
Oh.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.365
That is great.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.200
Well, that debate stuff
is gonna look amazing

06:39.300 --> 06:40.167
on your college apps.

06:40.268 --> 06:41.569
Yeah,

06:41.669 --> 06:43.337
Stanford admission guys
definitely have a hard on

06:43.436 --> 06:44.639
for those trophies.

06:44.739 --> 06:46.406
Uh, please,
let's not talk about college,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.175
hard ons, and my daughter
while I'm trying to eat.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.144
Oh my God, Dad, please.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.512
-Your mom started first.
-Mm-mm.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.014
You know, anyways,
this food is very good, Dad.

06:53.114 --> 06:54.315
Thank you.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.182
- Oh, you're so welcome.
- Hmm.

06:55.283 --> 06:56.584
Change the subject.

06:56.684 --> 06:57.752
It is good, it's great.

06:57.852 --> 06:58.686
Thank you.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.006
It's not the end of the world.

09:00.641 --> 09:04.245
I'm always here
to talk through your options.

09:05.446 --> 09:08.282
Getting accepted in the spring
is still a possibility.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.688
Consider submitting a letter
to the admissions board.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.791
What kind of letter?

09:16.891 --> 09:18.492
Well,
students sometimes have success

09:18.592 --> 09:21.162
with personal appeals.

09:21.262 --> 09:22.363
Okay, I'll do that.

09:22.463 --> 09:24.265
Don't let this define you.

09:26.467 --> 09:27.802
We could discuss that.

09:27.902 --> 09:29.070
Yeah, that'd be great.

09:29.170 --> 09:30.037
Yeah. Perfect.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.205
Like after practice
or something.

09:31.305 --> 09:32.006
Yeah, that's like perfect.

09:32.106 --> 09:32.840
-Cool.
-Cool.

09:32.940 --> 09:33.407
Oh.

09:34.141 --> 09:34.742
Alright!

09:34.842 --> 09:36.243
Afternoon, everyone.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.945
By now we've all met Camille.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.213
So let's give her a warm
welcome

09:39.313 --> 09:40.047
for her first team practice.

09:40.147 --> 09:40.714
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:40.815 --> 09:41.550
Hi, guys.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.983
Thank you so much.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.485
Okay, we're gonna divide up
into practice groups,

09:44.618 --> 09:45.820
so Camille,

09:45.920 --> 09:47.321
why don't you join up
with Olivia for today?

09:47.421 --> 09:48.823
Sounds good.

09:48.923 --> 09:49.757
Alright, let's have Debbie
with Sydney,

09:49.857 --> 09:51.826
and Crystal with Amelia.

09:57.198 --> 09:58.365
Let's run the case.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.473
I won my last couple of
tournaments on this topic,

10:05.574 --> 10:07.808
but I'm happy to look over
your arguments.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.610
Thanks,
but obviously I won, too,

10:09.710 --> 10:12.079
so I don't really think
that's necessary.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.080
Right.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.715
I'm-- I'm talking about
real tournaments

10:14.815 --> 10:17.451
with more than just
a couple of schools attending.

10:17.552 --> 10:18.719
I took notes
during your last debate.

10:18.819 --> 10:19.887
We could start with that.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.056
Why don't you just
read what I have?

10:22.156 --> 10:27.628
Um, I don't remember seein' you
at Nationals last year.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.396
I just think that this team
could really benefit

10:29.497 --> 10:30.764
from my leadership.

10:35.369 --> 10:37.271
Are you feeling okay?

10:39.440 --> 10:41.242
I'm happy to help you out
anytime!

10:41.342 --> 10:42.143
Fuck you!

10:42.243 --> 10:43.110
Olivia!

10:44.979 --> 10:45.346
Olivia.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.889
Olivia, can you hear me?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.996
You okay?

11:03.632 --> 11:04.965
Okay,
practice is over for today.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.834
We'll--
we'll pick it up tomorrow.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.038
Here, try to drink some water.

11:21.215 --> 11:22.883
I'm sorry.

11:25.219 --> 11:26.320
Hey, I understand

11:26.420 --> 11:28.889
that this has been
a really tough time for you,

11:28.989 --> 11:30.824
but that doesn't make it okay
to disrespect a teammate.

11:30.925 --> 11:32.661
But she started it.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.827
I think it's best
if you sit out

11:33.928 --> 11:34.728
this weekend's tournament.

11:34.828 --> 11:35.930
No, please, Richardson.

11:36.030 --> 11:37.965
Olivia,
you're under a lot of stress,

11:38.065 --> 11:38.832
okay?

11:38.933 --> 11:41.268
It's just one competition.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.772
Take the opportunity
to decompress.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.328
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:21.442 --> 12:22.644
Hey.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.678
Hi.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.379
Looks like you can use a ride.

12:36.691 --> 12:38.492
Thanks again.

12:38.593 --> 12:40.361
Hey, Liv.

12:40.461 --> 12:42.329
I, um...

12:48.536 --> 12:50.572
I miss her, too.

12:51.740 --> 12:53.440
Thanks.

12:59.013 --> 13:01.982
Sweetie, it'll be okay.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.451
It's a deferral,
it's not a rejection.

13:04.552 --> 13:05.953
I know you'll turn this around,

13:06.053 --> 13:07.988
you'll get accepted
in the spring.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.759
Yeah, they'd be idiots
not to have you.

13:17.498 --> 13:18.733
I don't know.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.968
I mean I'm filling in
as Captain this weekend,

13:21.068 --> 13:22.870
but I'm pretty sure
Richardson's

13:22.970 --> 13:24.438
gonna make it permanent.

13:24.539 --> 13:27.308
I mean she literally passed out
during practice.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.176
It's just kinda sad, you know.

13:30.712 --> 13:32.079
Oh my God, that's so sad.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.347
The next thing you know,
she's gonna pass out

13:33.447 --> 13:33.981
during the debate.

13:35.416 --> 13:36.785
Well, I've been wanting
to see that,

13:36.884 --> 13:37.818
but only if I was
on the other team, so...

13:51.666 --> 13:52.266
Hey.

13:53.367 --> 13:54.468
Whoa.

13:54.569 --> 13:56.003
Did you-- did you see?

13:58.506 --> 13:59.774
N-- never mind.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.342
Okay.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.780
Anyways uh,
do you need a ride again?

14:05.879 --> 14:07.582
Um no, I'm-- I'm fine, thanks.

14:07.682 --> 14:09.116
I fixed my car.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.217
Cool.

14:12.654 --> 14:13.854
Actually...

14:17.391 --> 14:18.859
Yeah?

14:22.196 --> 14:24.365
Would you wanna get a coffee
or something?

14:24.465 --> 14:26.233
Uh...

14:26.333 --> 14:29.870
Um, no--
no pressure if you're busy.

14:30.705 --> 14:33.207
No, I don't have anything.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.676
Let's do it.

14:34.776 --> 14:36.110
Okay.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.683
Wow,
this girl sounds like the worst.

14:41.783 --> 14:42.617
You're not wrong.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.653
I am so over
high school politics,

14:45.754 --> 14:47.488
I'll kill myself if I don't
get in somewhere soon.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.960
I, uh...

14:54.962 --> 14:56.430
I didn't mean...

14:57.766 --> 14:58.899
No, I know.

15:03.772 --> 15:07.107
Who the hell transfers
beginning of senior year anyway?

15:10.077 --> 15:12.413
You said this girl went
to Fairstone High?

15:12.514 --> 15:14.749
Uh, yeah,
I think it's in New York.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.356
Wait, shut the fuck up.

15:23.691 --> 15:24.659
What?

15:24.759 --> 15:25.860
The dates line up.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.829
It's the same school,
it's Camille.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.531
There's no way to know that.

15:31.533 --> 15:34.468
Wait,
did this girl frame her teacher?

15:34.569 --> 15:35.269
Yes!

15:35.369 --> 15:36.704
You have so much on her now.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.238
No one just moves across the
country for no reason.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.207
Um, okay.

15:40.307 --> 15:41.676
What do you want me to do?

15:41.776 --> 15:43.477
Just like go up to her
in the middle of debate practice

15:43.578 --> 15:45.647
and be like, "Hey, heard you
fake fucked your teacher?"

15:47.080 --> 15:48.215
No.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.150
You don't have to
publicly shame her.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.787
just let her know that you're
onto her little secret

15:52.887 --> 15:54.756
and force her to back off.

15:54.856 --> 15:56.023
Easy.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.528
Isn't that what you wanted?

16:01.629 --> 16:03.665
I don't know.

16:03.765 --> 16:06.033
What if it's not even true?

16:15.008 --> 16:17.010
Um,
I have to get some work done,

16:17.110 --> 16:19.614
but it was nice to hang.

16:19.714 --> 16:21.982
Yeah, it was, uh...

16:22.617 --> 16:24.051
It was good to see you.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.688
Thanks for um, letting me vent.

16:52.580 --> 16:55.717
For what good is a structure
without its foundation?

16:55.817 --> 16:57.585
When every insignificant
thought

16:57.685 --> 16:59.186
is published for the worlds

16:59.286 --> 17:00.989
at a click of a button,

17:01.088 --> 17:03.992
does it not rock
that very foundation?

17:04.091 --> 17:06.694
A beginning implies the start
of a journey,

17:06.794 --> 17:11.164
but as ideas, photos, and more
become increasingly ephemeral,

17:11.265 --> 17:13.935
that journey's length
becomes truncated.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.404
No longer is the beginning
a substantial step

17:17.505 --> 17:19.306
for the world.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.419
I cannot believe you found this.

17:32.520 --> 17:33.521
We got lucky.

17:33.621 --> 17:35.122
She was already 18
when it happened.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.891
What are you gonna do?

17:36.991 --> 17:37.892
I don't know.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.461
Do you have any ideas?

17:41.563 --> 17:42.830
Mm...

17:42.931 --> 17:45.733
I mean you should find some way
to mess with her head a bit.

17:45.833 --> 17:49.704
Honestly, you should DM her
and let her know that you know.

17:50.838 --> 17:52.607
Oh, that's way too risky.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.443
I wish there was a way
we could do it anonymously.

17:56.544 --> 17:59.179
You could, mm...

17:59.279 --> 18:02.550
I mean you could
make a new Connect profile.

18:02.650 --> 18:03.818
She'd have no idea.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.855
That is perfect.

18:07.956 --> 18:08.656
I know.

18:09.991 --> 18:12.392
I think I left my bag in my car.

18:12.492 --> 18:13.861
Do you have your computer?

18:13.962 --> 18:16.396
Shit, um, I left it at school.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.298
Oh, but I do have my old one.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.934
- Okay.
- Hang on.

18:20.034 --> 18:22.102
Oh, bingo.

18:22.604 --> 18:23.605
Okay.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.616
What?

18:44.559 --> 18:46.561
How did you...

18:46.661 --> 18:49.864
She must have logged on
last time she was over.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.334
I haven't used this laptop
in months.

19:02.442 --> 19:09.249
Well, I mean Camille
doesn't know her.

19:11.184 --> 19:14.354
That's kinda fucked up.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.290
Aren't we tryin'
to mess with her head?

19:23.598 --> 19:26.067
Honestly,
Jane would have loved this.

19:28.703 --> 19:30.237
You're right.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.272
She totally would.

19:34.842 --> 19:37.377
Plus, there's no way
she'd know it was us.

19:39.981 --> 19:40.615
Okay.

19:40.715 --> 19:41.281
Okay, fine.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.083
Fine, I'm in.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.184
-I'm in.
-Okay.

20:16.349 --> 20:17.451
How about "Don't think
we haven't noticed you

20:17.552 --> 20:19.386
throwing yourself
at Mr. Richardson.

20:19.486 --> 20:22.123
Guess old habits die hard."?

20:23.191 --> 20:24.525
Well?

20:25.727 --> 20:26.460
Perfect.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.579
-Okay, bye.
-See you later.

21:28.723 --> 21:30.725
"Your rye-straw hats put on

21:30.825 --> 21:33.393
and these fresh nymphs
encounter--

21:34.762 --> 21:37.632
The minute of their plot
is almost come.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.201
Well done.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.169
Avoid.

21:41.269 --> 21:42.837
No more."

21:46.207 --> 21:49.076
Isabelle, please continue.

21:51.813 --> 21:53.648
"This is strange.

21:53.748 --> 21:57.350
Your father's in some passion
that works him strongly.

21:57.450 --> 22:00.188
Never till this day
saw I him touched with anger,

22:00.288 --> 22:01.488
so distempered."

22:07.128 --> 22:08.296
No way.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.565
Maybe there's something
on Connect?

22:11.398 --> 22:14.502
-Her profile's not there.
-What?

22:14.602 --> 22:17.238
Wait, we were just messaging
with her this morning.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.506
Shit.

22:18.606 --> 22:19.874
You don't think
she knows it's us, do you?

22:19.974 --> 22:22.877
Oh no, we'd be in Rhode's
office by now.

22:24.679 --> 22:27.414
Liv,
but isn't this what you wanted?

22:28.916 --> 22:30.885
-I don't know.
-Don't over think it.

22:30.985 --> 22:32.153
This is a good thing.

22:32.253 --> 22:33.721
Mission accomplished.

22:42.830 --> 22:44.932
Hey Richardson,
do you have a sec?

22:45.032 --> 22:45.700
Yeah, of course.

22:45.800 --> 22:46.167
What's up?

22:46.267 --> 22:46.801
I just--

22:48.102 --> 22:49.871
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior last week.

22:49.971 --> 22:51.438
I've been thinking a lot
about the team

22:51.539 --> 22:53.341
and more than anything,

22:53.440 --> 22:55.076
I really wanna do my part
to make it the best

22:55.176 --> 22:56.677
that it can be.

22:56.777 --> 22:59.146
Even if that means sharing
leadership with Camille.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.281
I'm glad to hear you say that.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.782
I really think
we can find a way

23:01.883 --> 23:03.584
to combine our strengths
and work together.

23:03.684 --> 23:05.319
NatQuals is just around
the corner

23:05.418 --> 23:06.754
and with a little more effort,

23:06.854 --> 23:08.356
I know we can get the team
to Nationals.

23:08.455 --> 23:09.790
Well, I...

23:09.891 --> 23:11.491
I really appreciate
the go-get-'em attitude,

23:11.592 --> 23:13.694
but unfortunately
Camille decided

23:13.794 --> 23:14.862
that Greenwood
wasn't a good fit,

23:14.962 --> 23:17.497
so she's no longer
a student here.

23:17.598 --> 23:19.901
Oh no, I'm--
I'm so sorry to hear that.

23:23.738 --> 23:25.706
Is there anything else
you wanna talk about?

23:27.808 --> 23:29.110
Um, no.

23:31.779 --> 23:32.513
Okay.

23:32.613 --> 23:35.082
Well, I'm here if that changes.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.052
Okay, thanks.

23:38.152 --> 23:39.654
See you at practice.

23:39.754 --> 23:40.955
Okay.

23:42.056 --> 23:43.456
Are you sure there isn't a
sample letter you can show me?

23:44.959 --> 23:47.561
Olivia, this is supposed to be
a personal appeal.

23:47.662 --> 23:48.796
Other students' letters
won't work.

23:48.896 --> 23:50.398
Well, what's the right message?

23:50.497 --> 23:52.566
There must be something
that they're looking for.

23:52.667 --> 23:55.770
Just draw from important
moments in your life.

23:55.870 --> 23:59.840
I mean nothing in your first
draft feels uniquely you.

23:59.941 --> 24:01.375
What's something
that they wouldn't already know

24:01.474 --> 24:02.710
from your application?

24:06.948 --> 24:09.917
Send me your next draft
and we can go from there.

24:13.220 --> 24:14.454
Oh my God.

24:20.661 --> 24:23.998
I have to say, Ladies,
I'm pretty disappointed.

24:24.098 --> 24:27.467
Let's hope next week's papers
are more coherent.

24:29.804 --> 24:31.872
...beginning, I--
I just couldn't fathom

24:31.973 --> 24:33.207
the words that were
coming out of her mouth.

24:33.307 --> 24:34.075
Hey.

24:34.775 --> 24:36.277
Hey!

24:36.377 --> 24:38.813
Anyways, she really went

24:38.913 --> 24:40.581
and gave us a big huge
massive paper.

24:40.681 --> 24:42.583
I'm like, "Mrs. West is
legitimately

24:42.683 --> 24:44.352
the worst teacher and I--
I just don't understand."

24:44.452 --> 24:45.485
No.

24:45.586 --> 24:46.220
Yeah, she's trying to
sabotage--

25:14.682 --> 25:15.216
Nope.

25:15.316 --> 25:16.584
No way.

25:16.684 --> 25:18.719
Mrs. West probably
doesn't even have a Connect.

25:18.819 --> 25:19.420
Look.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.588
Oh.

25:20.688 --> 25:22.189
Okay, that's pretty sad.

25:22.289 --> 25:22.957
Yeah.

25:23.057 --> 25:24.125
But we can't.

25:24.225 --> 25:25.393
Well, she knew Jane.

25:25.493 --> 25:27.428
And Jane hated her.

25:28.896 --> 25:30.898
And don't you think
we'd be pushing our luck?

25:30.998 --> 25:33.134
She has such a bullshit
holier-than-thou attitude.

25:33.234 --> 25:35.736
We have to show people
how shitty West is.

25:35.836 --> 25:36.871
Okay, yes, that's true.

25:36.971 --> 25:37.872
She probably wouldn't
give an A

25:37.972 --> 25:39.340
if her life depended on it.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.609
And she made Jane's life
a living hell.

25:41.709 --> 25:43.611
Oh, now this...

25:43.711 --> 25:45.413
This would look so good on you.

25:45.514 --> 25:46.414
Uh-huh.

25:46.515 --> 25:47.815
-Take it.
-Okay.

25:47.915 --> 25:48.983
Yeah.

25:49.083 --> 25:49.917
Okay.

25:52.153 --> 25:53.154
Oh no.

25:53.254 --> 25:53.988
Alright.

25:54.088 --> 25:55.122
Um...

25:56.023 --> 25:58.659
One of these better work
for tonight.

25:58.759 --> 25:59.894
What's tonight?

26:00.828 --> 26:02.496
I'm going to a party with Phil.

26:02.596 --> 26:04.899
He's been acting like
so weird lately.

26:04.999 --> 26:06.434
Oh.

26:06.535 --> 26:08.202
I'm sorry that's annoying.

26:08.302 --> 26:09.837
Yeah.

26:10.738 --> 26:11.906
No, I don't like this.

26:12.406 --> 26:13.207
Oh.

26:13.307 --> 26:15.376
Okay, come here.

26:15.476 --> 26:16.210
Oh!

26:16.310 --> 26:17.178
I like this a lot.

26:18.079 --> 26:18.813
-Really?
-Yeah.

26:18.913 --> 26:20.414
Should we like double cuff it?

26:20.515 --> 26:21.248
I don't know.

26:21.348 --> 26:22.316
Oh, okay.

26:24.785 --> 26:26.854
You know, there's no way
she'd know it was us.

26:27.522 --> 26:28.756
She's a teacher.

26:28.856 --> 26:30.257
A private message
is not gonna do anything.

26:30.357 --> 26:33.961
Well, I do have an idea.

26:43.170 --> 26:47.542
On June 28th, 1914,
Archduke Franz Ferdinand

26:47.641 --> 26:49.810
and his wife Sophie
were assassinated

26:49.910 --> 26:52.446
on a visit to Sarajevo.

26:52.547 --> 26:55.416
This may seem
like a small moment,

26:55.517 --> 26:58.786
but Ferdinand was the heir
to the Austro-Hungarian empire.

26:58.886 --> 27:01.122
His death was the final straw,

27:01.222 --> 27:03.624
fracturing Europe
and starting World War I.

27:05.826 --> 27:07.529
What's so funny?

27:09.263 --> 27:10.664
Okay, hilarious, Ladies.

27:10.764 --> 27:12.233
Can we please focus?

27:15.604 --> 27:17.404
Ha, ha, ha, very mature.

27:19.273 --> 27:21.242
If you cannot use your
computers responsibly,

27:21.342 --> 27:23.677
you cannot use them.

27:25.813 --> 27:26.548
Oh!

27:28.617 --> 27:29.850
That's it!

27:29.950 --> 27:32.419
Close your computers,
turn off your phones!

27:32.521 --> 27:34.589
What--
What the hell?

27:34.688 --> 27:36.123
-That's it!
-Hey!

27:36.223 --> 27:38.627
What are you doing,
you entitled bitches?

27:38.726 --> 27:39.594
Stop it!

27:39.693 --> 27:40.794
Mia, what are you typing?

27:40.895 --> 27:42.363
-Give me that computer.
-Let-- let go!

27:56.377 --> 27:58.812
It's been re-posted like
100 times.

27:58.913 --> 27:59.847
Yeah.

27:59.947 --> 28:01.148
People are super freaked out.

28:02.416 --> 28:04.318
Honestly, it's a nice break
from talking about

28:04.418 --> 28:06.754
college acceptances.

28:06.854 --> 28:08.856
-Seriously?
-Mmhmm.

28:09.790 --> 28:12.426
By the way uh,
where are you applying?

28:12.527 --> 28:14.995
Uh,
top choice is still Stanford.

28:15.095 --> 28:15.664
We'll see.

28:15.763 --> 28:16.363
Right, right.

28:16.463 --> 28:17.464
Duh.

28:17.566 --> 28:19.133
Well, I'm sure you'll get in.

28:23.638 --> 28:25.873
These headlines are insane.

28:25.973 --> 28:28.842
"Student posthumously exposes
abuse in the classroom.

28:28.943 --> 28:32.213
Elite LA private school's
mysterious scandal."

28:33.080 --> 28:35.849
Wait, her Connect is gone.

28:35.950 --> 28:37.484
She must have deleted it.

28:37.586 --> 28:40.287
Those headlines are kinda harsh.

28:41.590 --> 28:43.157
She's kinda harsh.

28:43.257 --> 28:45.694
Jane is just exposing people
for who they really are.

28:47.194 --> 28:49.063
Yeah.

28:49.163 --> 28:50.397
To Jane.

28:50.497 --> 28:51.131
To Jane.

29:28.570 --> 29:29.903
Who is behind Jane?

29:30.004 --> 29:31.606
I can't believe someone
would do that.

29:31.706 --> 29:32.674
I know, right?

29:39.046 --> 29:40.114
It's kind of fucked.

29:40.214 --> 29:41.815
It's kind of awesome.

29:43.951 --> 29:46.387
Good morning, ladies.

29:46.487 --> 29:49.256
I'd like to talk
about what happened yesterday.

29:49.356 --> 29:52.092
While I don't condone
Mrs. West's behavior,

29:52.192 --> 29:56.030
I also do not condone tampering
with school computers,

29:56.130 --> 29:59.366
publicly antagonizing teachers,
and most of all,

29:59.466 --> 30:03.804
using a former student's
internet presence to do so.

30:03.904 --> 30:05.072
Whoever is behind this,

30:05.172 --> 30:07.074
needs to take a hard look
at themselves

30:07.174 --> 30:08.710
and think
about how their actions

30:08.809 --> 30:10.811
might have triggered people.

30:11.412 --> 30:14.948
Our community is only as strong
as you make it.

30:15.049 --> 30:17.184
Either one of you
volunteers information

30:17.284 --> 30:22.089
or I will sit down
with everyone individually.

30:28.763 --> 30:30.831
Olivia.

30:30.931 --> 30:34.968
Well, we all saw the same thing
I think.

30:35.069 --> 30:36.604
It seemed like someone
was playing a prank

30:36.705 --> 30:38.305
with the projector.

30:38.405 --> 30:42.443
It was rude,
but pretty harmless.

30:42.544 --> 30:45.212
But-- but then,
Mrs. West started yelling

30:45.312 --> 30:48.382
and grabbing
our personal belongings.

30:48.482 --> 30:50.417
She really overreacted.

30:50.518 --> 30:53.153
It was pretty scary to see
a teacher lose control

30:53.253 --> 30:54.789
like that.

30:54.888 --> 30:58.125
I don't know how
it got on Jane's page, though.

30:58.859 --> 31:00.928
That was really upsetting.

31:01.028 --> 31:03.732
Thank you for your honesty.

31:03.832 --> 31:07.267
We never want our students
to feel unsafe.

31:07.368 --> 31:10.204
Mrs. West is no longer a member
of our faculty.

31:10.304 --> 31:13.040
However,
she was a well-regarded member

31:13.140 --> 31:15.976
of our community
for over a decade.

31:16.076 --> 31:18.546
It's my responsibility
to get to the bottom of this.

31:18.646 --> 31:19.913
Hmm?

31:32.594 --> 31:33.994
Wow!

31:34.094 --> 31:36.598
Jane has 10,000 followers.

31:38.198 --> 31:40.535
Wow, that--
that's a serious platform.

31:40.635 --> 31:42.002
She'd be obsessed!

31:43.070 --> 31:45.874
That wasn't really her thing.

31:45.973 --> 31:47.609
If you say so.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.314
So, who's next?

31:57.117 --> 31:58.986
Did you see
what Jane just posted?

32:40.862 --> 32:42.129
Early bird gets the worm!

32:42.229 --> 32:43.798
-Alright!
-Hey.

32:43.898 --> 32:45.466
Don't think I haven't noticed
all this hard work

32:45.567 --> 32:47.000
you're puttin' in.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.703
It's good
to have our captain back.

32:48.803 --> 32:50.437
Thanks.

32:52.941 --> 32:54.542
This one about Jenny is so sad.

32:54.642 --> 32:56.443
"It's easy to make it look
like you have a boyfriend

32:56.544 --> 32:57.912
when you crop their actual
girlfriend out

32:58.011 --> 32:58.813
of the group photos."

32:58.913 --> 32:59.581
Nice.

33:00.715 --> 33:01.850
Wait, what?

33:01.950 --> 33:03.317
I thought you wrote that?

33:04.351 --> 33:05.620
Huh?

33:05.720 --> 33:07.054
I'm pretty sure it wasn't me.

33:07.154 --> 33:09.356
I know it wasn't me.

33:11.291 --> 33:13.427
No one else has access to Jane,
right?

33:13.528 --> 33:14.127
Of course not.

33:14.228 --> 33:15.630
We changed her password.

33:17.832 --> 33:20.100
I haven't told anyone.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.769
Neither have I.

33:22.871 --> 33:23.805
Okay.

33:23.905 --> 33:27.274
Um, let's just think about this.

33:27.374 --> 33:29.409
I remember you talking about
Jenny in the car last week.

33:29.511 --> 33:32.446
Maybe you posted it then
without thinking.

33:33.548 --> 33:34.414
Yes, whatever.

33:34.516 --> 33:36.183
It's not even
that big of a deal.

33:36.818 --> 33:38.953
Okay.

33:39.052 --> 33:41.188
Um, why don't we just come up
with a rule

33:41.288 --> 33:42.524
where we only post
when we're together?

33:42.624 --> 33:45.225
It's more fun that way anyway,
right?

33:45.325 --> 33:46.561
Sure.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.541
Hey.

34:34.842 --> 34:36.945
I-- I just decided this morning.

34:37.979 --> 34:39.547
Congrats.

34:39.647 --> 34:41.883
I didn't know
you were applying early, too.

34:41.983 --> 34:44.819
Yeah, yeah,
it was super last minute.

34:44.919 --> 34:46.688
Any news?

34:46.788 --> 34:49.122
Deferred.

34:50.558 --> 34:52.426
I really hope
we get to go together.

34:52.527 --> 34:55.763
It's what she would have wanted.

35:23.357 --> 35:25.325
Getting tough on teachers
will increase

35:25.425 --> 35:26.794
the overall quality
of education,

35:26.894 --> 35:30.632
and uh, and in turn
will provide a strong uh,

35:30.732 --> 35:34.602
foundation for the growth
of our country.

35:34.702 --> 35:36.336
Thank you.

35:41.943 --> 35:44.779
In a unanimous decision,
we've decided to vote in favor

35:44.879 --> 35:46.047
of the negation.

35:46.146 --> 35:47.882
The Lynley School
wins the final round.

36:02.597 --> 36:05.867
Hey,
how are we doing, Champ?

36:05.967 --> 36:07.068
I'm okay.

36:07.167 --> 36:08.770
Closing argument was bullshit.

36:11.105 --> 36:13.641
Oh, hey, great job today, guys.

36:13.741 --> 36:15.777
Really, I mean uh, I think
we know what we need to do

36:15.877 --> 36:17.645
in order to get ready
for the National Qualifications,

36:17.745 --> 36:18.445
yeah?

36:18.546 --> 36:19.714
Yeah.

36:19.814 --> 36:21.015
So let's just prep hard,
let's get it done.

36:21.115 --> 36:22.050
Yeah.

36:22.150 --> 36:23.216
Uh, before I let you go, though,

36:23.316 --> 36:24.819
Principal Rhodes
asked the faculty

36:24.919 --> 36:27.421
to talk to the students
about the whole Jane business.

36:28.656 --> 36:31.191
Obviously, cyber bullying
is not cool

36:31.291 --> 36:35.228
but this is a whole another
level of messed up.

36:35.328 --> 36:38.032
So if it's bringin' up
anything difficult for you,

36:38.132 --> 36:39.801
I'm here.

36:39.901 --> 36:41.936
You know, I hope you guys
aren't mixed up

36:42.036 --> 36:43.805
with this shit-- stuff.

36:43.905 --> 36:45.073
So uh, okay.

36:45.173 --> 36:45.973
That's it for today.

36:46.074 --> 36:46.841
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:54.448 --> 36:56.184
Hey.

36:56.283 --> 36:58.318
I don't want things
to be weird again.

36:58.418 --> 37:00.955
So uh, look what I snagged.

37:02.990 --> 37:04.659
Can I come in?

37:04.759 --> 37:05.827
Sure, come on.

37:09.664 --> 37:11.065
Oh my God!

37:12.066 --> 37:13.433
The basketball team!

37:13.534 --> 37:15.503
Those uniforms
were not a good look.

37:15.603 --> 37:16.604
No.

37:17.304 --> 37:18.371
Remember--

37:18.472 --> 37:19.741
How we would go
to the pizza parlor

37:19.841 --> 37:21.576
across the street
and we'd shorten our skirts

37:21.676 --> 37:23.276
just in case
we saw any cute boys.

37:24.979 --> 37:26.981
That was just you and Jane.

37:28.950 --> 37:31.953
Oh well, it was pathetic.

37:39.160 --> 37:39.727
Hmm.

37:41.863 --> 37:44.766
You have to come at this party
with me.

37:44.866 --> 37:46.167
What party?

37:46.266 --> 37:47.969
It's at Phil's house.

37:48.836 --> 37:51.773
I don't wanna get into it,
but uh...

37:51.873 --> 37:53.508
We broke up this week.

37:54.008 --> 37:55.176
I'm so sorry.

37:55.275 --> 37:56.744
I had no idea.

37:56.844 --> 37:58.079
Look what I got you.

37:58.179 --> 37:59.781
You can wear this.

37:59.881 --> 38:00.380
Um...

38:00.480 --> 38:01.616
-Wooh!
-Ooh.

38:01.716 --> 38:02.349
Voilà.

38:02.449 --> 38:03.818
-Hmm, it's cute.
-Um, I--

38:03.918 --> 38:06.621
I-- I-- I don't think so.

38:06.721 --> 38:08.756
Please, don't make me go alone.

38:10.925 --> 38:12.960
Please, please.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.662
Please, please, please, please.

38:19.901 --> 38:21.468
Welcome.

38:24.038 --> 38:25.506
I need a drink.

38:34.282 --> 38:34.982
Josa knows Phil?

38:35.817 --> 38:38.586
Uh,
she's always at these things.

38:43.958 --> 38:45.092
Wait, what?

38:47.360 --> 38:48.896
Fuck.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.665
We literally just broke up.

38:52.033 --> 38:53.534
Everyone thinks she's as sweet
and wholesome

38:53.634 --> 38:55.102
as that character
she plays on her TV show,

38:55.203 --> 38:56.504
but she's really not.

38:56.604 --> 38:58.039
You know, the whole time
Phil and I were together,

38:58.139 --> 39:02.442
she was flirting with him
and all the boys in his frat.

39:02.543 --> 39:04.312
But you wanna know a secret?

39:04.411 --> 39:06.379
She totally has a coke problem.

39:06.479 --> 39:07.982
-No way.
-Yes way.

39:09.984 --> 39:10.651
Fuck it.

39:10.751 --> 39:11.686
We just need to go dance.

39:11.786 --> 39:12.887
Let's have a good time, okay?

39:12.987 --> 39:13.788
Okay.

39:15.990 --> 39:17.258
Yeah, there you go.

39:17.357 --> 39:18.659
There you go, come on.

39:20.795 --> 39:21.361
It's okay.

39:28.669 --> 39:30.204
Izzy, hey!

39:30.304 --> 39:31.239
Oh my God!

39:42.683 --> 39:43.985
Hey.

39:44.085 --> 39:45.119
-Josa.
-You okay?

39:45.219 --> 39:46.320
Um, yeah--

39:46.419 --> 39:47.755
How about you mind
your own business?

39:49.624 --> 39:51.826
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

39:55.296 --> 39:56.731
Come on.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.807
Come here.

40:11.245 --> 40:12.179
Perfect.

40:15.216 --> 40:16.449
Oh my God,

40:16.550 --> 40:17.752
I cannot stand
how she's roamin' around here

40:17.852 --> 40:19.787
acting like she's better
than everybody else.

40:19.887 --> 40:21.255
Well, she's not.

40:21.355 --> 40:22.857
It's so fake.

40:22.957 --> 40:24.258
Tell that to Phil.

40:28.195 --> 40:29.897
Maybe Jane could say something.

40:31.999 --> 40:32.600
I wish.

40:32.700 --> 40:33.501
No one would believe it.

40:33.601 --> 40:35.002
She has too many fans.

40:35.102 --> 40:37.138
We'd just look like
another stupid internet troll.

40:38.438 --> 40:39.907
Whatever.

40:40.007 --> 40:42.442
I'm just happy I won't have
to see any of them in the fall.

40:42.543 --> 40:44.278
On a more fun note--

40:45.913 --> 40:47.281
Do you want one?

40:47.381 --> 40:48.382
What is that?

40:48.481 --> 40:49.917
Molly.

40:50.017 --> 40:51.519
-Since when do you--
-It's harmless.

40:51.619 --> 40:53.354
It only lasts a few hours, okay?

40:53.453 --> 40:54.555
And I usually don't,

40:54.655 --> 40:56.590
but it seemed
like a special occasion.

40:57.457 --> 40:58.926
Come on, don't be nervous!

40:59.026 --> 41:00.661
It'll cheer us up
and give you enough energy

41:00.761 --> 41:02.797
to get back up
on the dance floor.

41:07.201 --> 41:09.437
Wait a minute!

41:09.537 --> 41:10.671
What?

41:12.472 --> 41:14.775
What if we slip some to Josa?

41:18.179 --> 41:18.980
What?

41:19.080 --> 41:20.114
Yeah.

41:20.214 --> 41:22.817
It'll show everyone how she's
not so perfect.

41:23.317 --> 41:24.885
No.

41:24.986 --> 41:26.120
Really?

41:27.188 --> 41:29.123
Damn.

41:29.223 --> 41:30.524
Okay, Liv.

41:36.931 --> 41:38.199
Okay.

41:41.068 --> 41:42.236
Fuck.

41:43.504 --> 41:45.306
One for you.

41:46.374 --> 41:47.541
One for me.

41:47.641 --> 41:49.510
And a little extra
for our guest of honor.

41:52.747 --> 41:54.348
Yeah, I'm obsessed with you,
Josa.

41:54.448 --> 41:55.082
No.

41:55.816 --> 41:56.717
Yeah.

41:56.817 --> 41:57.585
Can't stop watching the show.

41:58.519 --> 41:59.954
Yeah, I know.

42:00.054 --> 42:03.157
Oh my gosh, I am so sorry
for being such a bitch earlier.

42:03.257 --> 42:05.159
Um, it's okay.

42:05.259 --> 42:08.129
I was just really worried
about Olivia and I snapped.

42:08.229 --> 42:09.163
I feel much better now.

42:09.263 --> 42:11.132
Thank you for caring.

42:11.232 --> 42:12.867
Um, do you want one?

42:12.967 --> 42:14.435
I just really needed a break
from alcohol

42:14.535 --> 42:16.303
and this is all I could find.

42:16.404 --> 42:17.972
Thanks, I'm parched.

42:18.906 --> 42:20.608
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

42:21.375 --> 42:22.943
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

42:25.346 --> 42:26.847
Oh yeah, that's so good.

42:26.947 --> 42:28.382
Let's finish these up
and dance!

42:28.482 --> 42:29.383
-Hmm, hmm, hmm.
-Yeah.

42:29.483 --> 42:30.418
-Hmm, hmm.
-Yeah, yeah.

42:30.519 --> 42:31.452
Hmm.

42:31.552 --> 42:32.453
-Mm.
-Mm.

42:32.553 --> 42:34.155
-Mmhmm.
-Mmhmm.

42:34.255 --> 42:35.156
Come on.

42:40.494 --> 42:42.029
<i>♪  </i> I love you, guys!

42:44.131 --> 42:45.032
So much!

42:46.400 --> 42:48.235
Tonight is fucking amazing!

42:49.403 --> 42:50.371
My heart is racing.

42:50.471 --> 42:51.906
Hey guys, is your heart racing?

42:52.006 --> 42:54.141
I guess we danced a lot, huh?

43:03.250 --> 43:03.918
Josa!

43:04.018 --> 43:04.585
Josa, come here!

43:11.625 --> 43:13.461
She's right, though,
this is amazing!

43:33.314 --> 43:34.315
Oh no.

43:49.163 --> 43:50.865
What's wrong?

43:52.333 --> 43:54.301
Nothing.

43:54.401 --> 43:56.670
I'm really happy right now.

43:56.770 --> 43:59.106
This is the happiest I've felt
in a really long time.

44:02.209 --> 44:02.943
Same.

44:09.216 --> 44:11.185
These past few months
have really sucked.

44:13.654 --> 44:15.156
I know.

44:19.561 --> 44:21.195
I really miss her.

44:24.331 --> 44:25.966
Are you mad at me?

44:26.066 --> 44:27.468
What?

44:27.569 --> 44:29.036
No!

44:29.136 --> 44:30.004
I love you.

44:31.238 --> 44:33.140
I love you, too, but...

44:36.677 --> 44:38.879
Are you mad at me?

44:40.915 --> 44:43.184
I should have told you
about Stanford.

44:48.455 --> 44:50.424
I just...

44:52.693 --> 44:55.863
I wish you hadn't disappeared.

44:57.097 --> 44:59.668
I didn't know what else to do.

45:01.902 --> 45:03.971
Neither did I.

45:05.574 --> 45:08.809
But before...

45:11.779 --> 45:14.281
-You left us behind.
-I didn't leave.

45:16.717 --> 45:18.385
I didn't leave.

45:21.755 --> 45:24.792
I don't know,
let's just say

45:26.026 --> 45:27.562
everything was changing

45:27.662 --> 45:31.832
and I thought you guys
had each other.

45:40.508 --> 45:42.743
I just want things
to go back to normal again.

45:47.348 --> 45:49.551
Me, too.

45:49.651 --> 45:51.952
I'm really happy we're friends
again.

45:52.052 --> 45:52.753
-Yeah.
-Me, too.

45:55.456 --> 45:56.524
I missed you, Izzy.

46:02.863 --> 46:03.732
Call 911 or something.

46:04.965 --> 46:06.501
Someone get help!

46:11.905 --> 46:13.407
Yo, cut the music.

46:16.243 --> 46:16.745
Call 911.

46:16.844 --> 46:17.646
Josa?

46:17.746 --> 46:18.713
Oh my God!

46:21.315 --> 46:22.216
Help!

46:22.316 --> 46:24.485
I don't know.

46:24.586 --> 46:28.222
Let's get out of here.

46:28.322 --> 46:29.356
Everybody, out!

46:29.456 --> 46:30.525
Fuck, out!

46:53.881 --> 46:55.416
Izzy.

46:55.517 --> 46:56.685
Izzy?

46:56.785 --> 46:57.885
- Oh my God.
- Oh, I'm sleeping.

46:57.985 --> 46:59.486
No, you need to see this.

47:03.525 --> 47:05.025
What the hell?

47:05.125 --> 47:06.327
Why would you post this?

47:06.427 --> 47:07.796
I didn't.

47:07.895 --> 47:09.430
Then how did it end up there?

47:09.531 --> 47:11.533
I-- I-- I really don't know.

47:11.633 --> 47:13.501
We agreed not to post anything
after she got sick.

47:13.601 --> 47:14.902
Uh, maybe you blacked out?

47:15.002 --> 47:16.036
Where did that video
even come from?

47:16.136 --> 47:17.938
We didn't film that shit.

47:18.038 --> 47:20.407
- This is bad.
- Yeah.

47:20.508 --> 47:22.042
You swear you didn't tell any
of your friends about Jane?

47:22.142 --> 47:24.378
Of course not, I'm not an idiot!

47:24.478 --> 47:26.815
Okay, well,
I didn't tell anyone either.

47:26.914 --> 47:28.982
Obviously.

47:30.150 --> 47:32.086
Okay, well,
if you didn't tell anyone

47:32.186 --> 47:33.755
and I didn't tell anyone,
then who did?

47:33.854 --> 47:36.256
I have no clue.

47:36.357 --> 47:37.324
Okay.

47:38.492 --> 47:40.762
Okay, um,

47:40.861 --> 47:43.063
no more posting
until this blows over, okay?

47:43.163 --> 47:46.033
Actually, we-- we should
just delete the whole profile.

47:48.570 --> 47:51.071
Delete her?

47:51.171 --> 47:53.073
It's not even her anymore.

47:56.343 --> 47:57.545
Fine.

48:06.220 --> 48:08.322
-It's not working.
-Give it to me.

48:13.293 --> 48:14.461
It's done.

48:24.905 --> 48:28.510
Um, I-- I have to go.

48:29.109 --> 48:30.645
Text me later?

48:38.118 --> 48:41.188
Hey hon, how was your night?

48:41.288 --> 48:41.955
Fine.

48:42.055 --> 48:43.290
You look awful.

48:43.390 --> 48:44.793
Thanks, Mom.

48:44.893 --> 48:45.760
You hungry?

48:45.860 --> 48:46.761
I'm makin' your favorite.

48:46.861 --> 48:47.995
Uh, I'm good.

48:48.095 --> 48:49.263
I'm just gonna nap

48:49.363 --> 48:50.598
and then power through
some college apps.

48:50.698 --> 48:51.833
You should really soak up
whatever you drank

48:51.932 --> 48:53.333
with some food.

48:53.434 --> 48:57.806
By the way, Livi,
I got an email from your school.

48:57.906 --> 49:01.910
Something about Jane
and a cyber-bully.

49:02.009 --> 49:04.278
Parents have been asked
to notify your principal

49:04.378 --> 49:07.214
if they see
or hear anything.

49:07.314 --> 49:09.584
Is there anything
you wanna talk about?

49:10.350 --> 49:11.519
No.

49:11.619 --> 49:12.986
Well, make sure you stay away
from that stuff.

49:13.086 --> 49:14.221
You know, last year a bunch
of kids lost

49:14.321 --> 49:15.489
their college acceptances

49:15.590 --> 49:17.559
because of dumb shit
they posted online.

49:17.659 --> 49:20.160
It stays around forever,
it's not worth it.

49:20.260 --> 49:22.496
But I know you know that.

50:15.148 --> 50:18.051
How the hell could it
have possibly been reactivated?

50:18.151 --> 50:20.420
I have no idea.

50:21.288 --> 50:22.824
Attention, A block Seniors,

50:22.924 --> 50:27.160
please report to the library
student lounge immediately.

50:35.035 --> 50:36.538
It has come to my attention

50:36.638 --> 50:39.774
that a serious incident
took place on Saturday evening

50:39.874 --> 50:45.947
at a non-school affiliated event
attended by Greenwood students.

50:46.046 --> 50:48.983
One of your classmates
has been hospitalized

50:49.082 --> 50:52.787
after being slipped
150 milligrams

50:52.887 --> 50:55.188
of the drug MDMA.

50:57.124 --> 51:01.596
That student
is still in intensive care.

51:01.696 --> 51:05.232
Obviously, this is a deeply
upsetting situation,

51:05.332 --> 51:09.436
made worse by the fact that
footage of the attack was posted

51:09.537 --> 51:13.173
by the Connect profile
known as "Jane".

51:13.273 --> 51:18.111
An account I know you are all
familiar with.

51:19.714 --> 51:20.748
Over the coming week,

51:20.848 --> 51:24.052
I will sit down
with each and every one of you

51:24.151 --> 51:26.320
to get to the bottom
of the video post,

51:26.420 --> 51:29.356
as well as whoever is
manipulating the account.

51:29.456 --> 51:34.094
I assure you severe consequences
will land on any student

51:34.194 --> 51:37.632
who has hurt our community
or Jane's memory.

51:39.399 --> 51:41.201
Bet Stanford won't take Josa
after this.

51:41.301 --> 51:43.403
No, her parents can claim
she was drugged,

51:43.504 --> 51:45.707
but I hope she applied
to a safety.

51:47.174 --> 51:48.576
I can't believe
this is happening.

51:48.676 --> 51:50.210
I keep trying to delete
the page over and over again,

51:50.310 --> 51:51.646
it just keeps coming back.

51:51.746 --> 51:53.480
It m-- it must be some kind of
glitch or something.

51:53.581 --> 51:54.481
No, but that--

51:54.582 --> 51:56.884
Let's just get our story
straight, okay?

51:56.985 --> 51:57.852
Sure.

51:59.053 --> 52:00.153
Um, okay.

52:00.253 --> 52:02.489
Um, we-- we were at the party.

52:02.590 --> 52:04.926
Um, we-- we hung out with Josa.

52:06.193 --> 52:07.695
We didn't see
anything suspicious

52:07.795 --> 52:10.464
and we-- we don't know anything
about who's using Jane, right?

52:13.968 --> 52:15.202
Right.

52:18.740 --> 52:21.174
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

52:21.274 --> 52:22.610
We did this together.

52:25.747 --> 52:27.548
Will see you tomorrow.

52:59.914 --> 53:01.381
Olivia, come in.

53:08.089 --> 53:09.590
Close the door behind you.

53:16.964 --> 53:21.334
So far these interviews
have been incredibly helpful.

53:21.703 --> 53:23.671
Mm, I'm so glad.

53:23.771 --> 53:24.772
I'll dive right in.

53:24.872 --> 53:27.075
Did you have any interaction
with Josa Jacobs

53:27.175 --> 53:28.843
the night of the incident?

53:28.943 --> 53:31.012
Um, I-- I spoke with her
briefly

53:31.112 --> 53:32.613
earlier in the evening.

53:32.714 --> 53:35.149
Um, and I was near her
when she started getting sick.

53:35.248 --> 53:36.383
Oh.

53:36.483 --> 53:38.986
Would you say you ladies
were close?

53:39.754 --> 53:41.155
Not really.

53:41.254 --> 53:43.591
Did you see anything
or anyone suspicious

53:43.691 --> 53:44.592
at the party?

53:46.060 --> 53:47.360
No.

53:47.461 --> 53:50.297
It seemed like everyone
was supposed to be there.

53:50.397 --> 53:53.735
Did you witness anyone drinking
or doing drugs?

53:54.502 --> 53:57.538
Uh, there was alcohol.

53:57.638 --> 53:59.874
I'm-- I'm not really sure
about anything else.

53:59.974 --> 54:01.274
Mmhmm.

54:01.374 --> 54:04.178
And how about anyone
who would want to harm Josa?

54:04.545 --> 54:09.584
Any grudges, rivalries,
arguments?

54:10.218 --> 54:12.452
You know,
no one's coming to mind.

54:12.553 --> 54:14.722
Everyone really seems
to like her.

54:17.390 --> 54:21.863
And have you ever had any
interaction with Jane's account?

54:21.963 --> 54:23.998
Uh, not since she...

54:28.903 --> 54:32.073
WOMAN 4
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

54:32.173 --> 54:34.008
Anything else you wanna say?

54:35.042 --> 54:35.643
No.

54:37.078 --> 54:39.714
Olivia, your name has come up
a number of times

54:39.814 --> 54:40.715
in these sessions,

54:40.815 --> 54:42.617
and I know you and Jane
were very close,

54:42.717 --> 54:47.188
and I'm sure this year has been
incredibly difficult for you,

54:47.287 --> 54:49.624
but now is the time to speak up.

54:54.862 --> 54:57.198
I swear
I don't know anything else.

55:02.170 --> 55:03.303
Yeah, one moment.

55:03.403 --> 55:05.139
I have to take this.

55:05.239 --> 55:06.207
Hello.

55:06.306 --> 55:08.308
Yes, it's a fine time.

55:10.144 --> 55:11.378
We'll pick this up later.

55:12.814 --> 55:13.648
Yeah.

55:13.748 --> 55:15.082
Uh.

55:15.183 --> 55:16.684
Uh, yeah.

55:16.784 --> 55:22.355
Yes, the IP address responsible
for the account would be great.

55:22.455 --> 55:25.293
Well, the beginning of next
week would be just fine.

55:25.392 --> 55:28.129
Oh, really appreciate your help
and expertise...

55:40.340 --> 55:41.341
What?

55:48.481 --> 55:49.784
Olivia.

55:49.884 --> 55:51.719
Olivia, you okay?

55:51.819 --> 55:52.787
Olivia.

55:56.423 --> 55:58.593
Feeling better?

56:01.829 --> 56:04.532
Maybe it doesn't matter
if Rhodes gets the IP address.

56:04.632 --> 56:07.101
Maybe not to you,
but if she does,

56:07.201 --> 56:08.502
it'll lead her right here.

56:08.603 --> 56:09.637
The first time
we used the account

56:09.737 --> 56:11.639
was on my computer,
at my house.

56:11.739 --> 56:13.641
Remember?

56:13.741 --> 56:15.543
I logged in on mine, too.

56:18.378 --> 56:19.847
We have to come clean.

56:19.947 --> 56:20.781
No.

56:20.882 --> 56:21.716
Yes.

56:21.816 --> 56:23.551
They're gonna find out
anyways.

56:23.651 --> 56:26.419
This way we can control
the story.

56:26.520 --> 56:27.822
It's not too late.

56:27.922 --> 56:29.891
I-- I'm sure that we can
figure something else out.

56:29.991 --> 56:32.492
We can't keep digging
ourselves in this hole.

56:32.593 --> 56:34.295
Maybe if we come clean,
they'll appreciate it

56:34.394 --> 56:35.596
and they'll believe us

56:35.696 --> 56:36.898
when we say
we had nothing to do with Josa.

56:36.998 --> 56:37.832
Blame it on grief.

56:37.932 --> 56:39.267
Say...

56:39.367 --> 56:41.035
Say it got out of hand.

56:41.135 --> 56:42.370
And then what?

56:42.469 --> 56:43.537
You lose Stanford?

56:43.638 --> 56:44.972
We-- we don't graduate?

56:59.987 --> 57:02.723
That's interesting.

57:02.823 --> 57:04.158
What?

57:04.258 --> 57:05.660
Where's your router?

57:05.760 --> 57:09.429
Mm, somewhere in my dad's office
I think.

57:09.530 --> 57:11.032
-Why?
-Be right back.

58:07.555 --> 58:09.590
What are you doing?

58:09.690 --> 58:10.791
Everything's gonna be okay.

58:10.891 --> 58:11.726
What?

58:11.826 --> 58:14.962
-How?
-Your parents have a VPN.

58:15.062 --> 58:17.497
What about the IP address?

58:17.598 --> 58:20.101
When you have a VPN,
it hides your IP address.

58:20.201 --> 58:22.003
They can't find us.

58:22.103 --> 58:23.804
Are you sure?

58:23.904 --> 58:25.873
100%.

58:27.408 --> 58:28.843
Okay.

58:28.943 --> 58:30.611
Okay, great.

58:30.711 --> 58:32.380
I have to get ready
for this thing.

58:32.480 --> 58:34.949
You should see yourself out.

58:35.049 --> 58:36.517
Okay.

59:17.625 --> 59:19.493
Thank you, Izzy,
you've been very helpful.

59:19.593 --> 59:20.961
You're welcome.

59:30.371 --> 59:31.572
Hello, Ladies.

59:31.672 --> 59:33.641
Ah, just the one I want.
Just come with me.

59:33.741 --> 59:34.675
-Oh!
-I'm so sorry.

59:34.775 --> 59:35.910
No, no, it's okay.

59:36.010 --> 59:36.911
No worries.

59:37.011 --> 59:39.380
Hey, how is that letter
coming along?

59:39.480 --> 59:40.948
-So far so good.
-Good.

59:51.125 --> 59:51.992
Oh, s-- sorry.

59:52.093 --> 59:52.960
Hi.

59:53.060 --> 59:54.395
I um,
I didn't mean to scare you.

59:54.495 --> 59:56.097
Uh, no, it's okay.

59:57.098 --> 59:58.833
Hey, can I have
some black coffee, please?

59:58.933 --> 59:59.667
Thanks.

1:00:00.701 --> 1:00:01.836
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:00:01.936 --> 1:00:03.538
What-- what are you doing here?

1:00:03.637 --> 1:00:05.973
Oh, my-- my mom works
down the street.

1:00:06.073 --> 1:00:07.675
Do you have a few minutes
to chat?

1:00:07.775 --> 1:00:09.677
Um, not really.

1:00:09.777 --> 1:00:11.112
I have to get to debate soon.

1:00:11.212 --> 1:00:14.048
Right, but you have
like 10 minutes, right?

1:00:14.148 --> 1:00:15.349
Please?

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:17.852
Sure, yeah.

1:00:21.755 --> 1:00:24.658
I'm really glad I ran into you.

1:00:24.758 --> 1:00:27.529
I've been wanting to apologize
for how I acted.

1:00:27.628 --> 1:00:29.230
-Oh no, you don't have--
-No, no.

1:00:29.330 --> 1:00:31.799
I was super shitty to you.

1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:35.269
Honestly, I was dealing
with a lot of fucked up stuff.

1:00:35.369 --> 1:00:37.271
But that-- that's not an excuse.

1:00:38.005 --> 1:00:40.107
Especially,
''cause you were, too.

1:00:42.009 --> 1:00:43.344
What?

1:00:44.011 --> 1:00:48.015
I--
I learned the truth about Jane.

1:00:48.115 --> 1:00:49.183
I'm so sorry.

1:00:49.283 --> 1:00:51.452
I-- I can't imagine losing
a friend like that,

1:00:51.553 --> 1:00:53.654
and at the beginning of
senior year.

1:00:55.389 --> 1:00:57.992
Yeah, um, it's okay.

1:01:00.494 --> 1:01:01.729
Thank you.

1:01:03.532 --> 1:01:05.065
Uh, anyway um, how are you?

1:01:05.166 --> 1:01:06.934
Like how's school?

1:01:07.034 --> 1:01:09.470
I've been reading
about all this craziness.

1:01:09.571 --> 1:01:11.872
Yeah, it's been pretty wild.

1:01:11.972 --> 1:01:15.809
You know, I think I might have
been one of the first victims.

1:01:16.777 --> 1:01:19.514
Yeah, whoever is using her
is the reason

1:01:19.614 --> 1:01:22.082
why I got pulled out of school.

1:01:23.284 --> 1:01:25.319
Are you sure?

1:01:26.220 --> 1:01:29.723
Back home uh,
there was this teacher

1:01:29.823 --> 1:01:32.561
who harassed me
for about a year.

1:01:32.661 --> 1:01:36.797
Super inappropriate,
weird sexual stuff.

1:01:36.897 --> 1:01:40.701
I told my parents about it,
they didn't believe me.

1:01:40.801 --> 1:01:43.737
And then I went to the school
and they turned it

1:01:43.837 --> 1:01:45.806
into this big thing.

1:01:45.906 --> 1:01:47.841
Because there wasn't any
evidence,

1:01:47.942 --> 1:01:50.377
he made it look
like I was lying.

1:01:51.212 --> 1:01:54.081
He claims that I was infatuated
with him.

1:01:54.181 --> 1:01:56.016
Which is insane.

1:01:56.850 --> 1:02:00.120
But the school took his side.

1:02:01.021 --> 1:02:03.324
Then my parents
made us move here and--

1:02:03.424 --> 1:02:05.759
Yeah, they were too embarrassed
to stay in New York.

1:02:07.194 --> 1:02:08.963
That's horrible.

1:02:09.063 --> 1:02:13.100
Anyway, whoever it is
found out somehow

1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:16.571
and accused me of doing
the same thing here.

1:02:16.671 --> 1:02:19.106
And then my mom
saw the messages,

1:02:19.206 --> 1:02:21.809
and yet again,
believed some stranger

1:02:21.909 --> 1:02:23.377
over her own daughter.

1:02:23.477 --> 1:02:24.445
So...

1:02:25.647 --> 1:02:28.949
I'm so, so sorry.

1:02:29.783 --> 1:02:32.119
Hey, it's not your fault, right?

1:02:45.634 --> 1:02:46.735
Right?

1:02:46.834 --> 1:02:48.570
What?

1:02:48.670 --> 1:02:50.404
Oh, you have to get to debate,
right?

1:02:50.505 --> 1:02:51.640
Yeah, thanks.

1:02:52.139 --> 1:02:53.508
Hey,
it was really nice seeing you.

1:03:15.896 --> 1:03:17.064
Stop!

1:03:21.168 --> 1:03:22.336
Stop!

1:03:29.577 --> 1:03:31.045
This isn't you.

1:03:38.018 --> 1:03:39.320
Stop!

1:04:57.665 --> 1:05:00.167
Hey, we need to talk.

1:05:01.703 --> 1:05:02.804
What's up?

1:05:02.903 --> 1:05:05.406
I just found out
Josa got into Stanford.

1:05:06.140 --> 1:05:08.475
You didn't know that
before the party, did you?

1:05:08.576 --> 1:05:11.011
No, I had no idea.

1:05:11.111 --> 1:05:15.550
Hmm, okay, ''cause it just
seemed a bit coincidental.

1:05:16.851 --> 1:05:18.586
What are you trying to say?

1:05:18.686 --> 1:05:20.655
Nothing.

1:05:20.755 --> 1:05:23.691
I just had to ask.

1:05:23.792 --> 1:05:25.959
I'll see you around.

1:06:02.062 --> 1:06:03.731
Oh my God.

1:06:05.900 --> 1:06:07.635
First round starts in an hour,
okay?

1:06:10.437 --> 1:06:12.941
Okay, I'ma let you all
get your cases together.

1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:14.542
You got this.

1:06:14.642 --> 1:06:15.409
Yeah?

1:06:19.814 --> 1:06:20.882
Hey.

1:06:20.981 --> 1:06:22.817
Everything okay?

1:06:22.917 --> 1:06:25.252
Yeah.

1:06:25.352 --> 1:06:26.888
Yeah?

1:06:26.987 --> 1:06:28.623
Everything's great.

1:06:28.723 --> 1:06:29.557
Okay.

1:06:29.657 --> 1:06:30.825
Final Nat Quals!

1:06:32.794 --> 1:06:35.062
I'm really proud of you
for rallyin' this year.

1:06:37.498 --> 1:06:38.999
Thanks.

1:07:09.162 --> 1:07:12.466
- Hi!
- You're a liar.

1:07:12.567 --> 1:07:13.467
What do you mean?

1:07:13.568 --> 1:07:14.802
You lied about the VPN.

1:07:14.903 --> 1:07:16.370
I don't have a secure network.

1:07:16.470 --> 1:07:18.038
I-- I--
I didn't lie about the VPN.

1:07:18.138 --> 1:07:19.641
And I noticed you've been
deleting everything

1:07:19.741 --> 1:07:22.109
you posted on Jane.

1:07:22.209 --> 1:07:23.912
I-- I haven't deleted anything
I swear.

1:07:24.012 --> 1:07:25.747
What are you doing, dude?

1:07:25.847 --> 1:07:27.682
We're both in deep shit here,
so if you have a plan,

1:07:27.782 --> 1:07:29.984
please clue me in.

1:07:30.083 --> 1:07:32.286
Um, Izzy, we--
we don't need a plan.

1:07:32.386 --> 1:07:34.288
Um, you--
you have a private network.

1:07:34.388 --> 1:07:35.723
You know that's bullshit.

1:07:35.823 --> 1:07:37.057
And you know what?

1:07:37.157 --> 1:07:39.393
I think you're trying
to pin this all on me.

1:07:39.493 --> 1:07:41.629
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm calling Rhodes now

1:07:41.729 --> 1:07:42.797
and telling her everything.

1:07:42.897 --> 1:07:43.998
Wait, Izzy, please.

1:07:44.097 --> 1:07:45.299
Um, like can we
just talk about this?

1:07:45.399 --> 1:07:46.901
I can come over
and we can figure out a plan

1:07:47.001 --> 1:07:48.101
on how to come clean together,
okay?

1:07:48.201 --> 1:07:50.038
It's too late.

1:07:50.137 --> 1:07:52.139
Izzy?

1:08:34.314 --> 1:08:35.482
What are you doin' here?

1:08:35.583 --> 1:08:36.618
Hey, Iz.

1:08:36.718 --> 1:08:37.852
You can't just show up
in my backyard anymore,

1:08:37.952 --> 1:08:38.953
this is insane.

1:08:39.053 --> 1:08:40.253
I know.

1:08:40.354 --> 1:08:41.455
Um, can we please just talk?

1:08:41.556 --> 1:08:43.791
There's nothing to talk about.

1:08:43.891 --> 1:08:45.192
You tried to frame me.

1:08:45.292 --> 1:08:47.095
Did you really think you'd
get away with that?

1:08:48.195 --> 1:08:49.030
Just-- just let me explain.

1:08:49.129 --> 1:08:50.565
You're pathetic.

1:08:50.665 --> 1:08:53.067
The only person you care about
is yourself.

1:08:53.166 --> 1:08:54.736
You were too self-absorbed
to even notice

1:08:54.836 --> 1:08:56.104
Jane was depressed.

1:08:56.203 --> 1:08:57.872
That's not fair.

1:08:57.972 --> 1:08:59.907
You're a coward!

1:09:01.042 --> 1:09:03.011
You abandoned us!

1:09:03.111 --> 1:09:04.177
You really hurt her!

1:09:04.277 --> 1:09:06.213
You have no idea
how she was feeling!

1:09:06.313 --> 1:09:07.982
And then, where were you?

1:09:08.082 --> 1:09:09.249
I needed you.

1:09:09.349 --> 1:09:10.718
All you ever do
is hide behind Jane

1:09:10.818 --> 1:09:13.688
instead of dealing
with your own problems!

1:09:13.788 --> 1:09:15.623
I'm just happy I won't have
to see your ass at Stanford

1:09:15.723 --> 1:09:16.991
in the fall.

1:09:24.866 --> 1:09:26.668
You should leave.

1:09:29.871 --> 1:09:30.638
What the fuck!

1:09:39.047 --> 1:09:40.148
You fucking psycho!

1:10:21.055 --> 1:10:22.824
Izzy.

1:10:24.192 --> 1:10:25.626
Izzy?

1:10:25.727 --> 1:10:27.294
Izzy.

1:10:30.531 --> 1:10:31.165
Izzy!

1:10:32.232 --> 1:10:32.934
Izzy!

1:10:33.034 --> 1:10:33.868
Izzy!

1:10:45.179 --> 1:10:45.913
Izzy.

1:10:47.782 --> 1:10:49.050
Izzy.

1:10:52.220 --> 1:10:55.723
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1:10:55.823 --> 1:10:58.626
No, no, no.

1:10:58.726 --> 1:11:01.461
No, you wake up.

1:11:01.562 --> 1:11:02.530
Come on.

1:11:02.630 --> 1:11:03.097
Wake up.

1:11:03.197 --> 1:11:04.031
Please, wake up.

1:11:04.132 --> 1:11:05.499
Please, wake up.

1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:06.567
Please.

1:11:06.667 --> 1:11:07.802
Please.

1:11:07.902 --> 1:11:08.736
Please!

1:11:10.838 --> 1:11:11.304
No.

1:11:11.404 --> 1:11:13.174
Oh, please.

1:11:19.479 --> 1:11:20.982
What do I do?

1:11:58.553 --> 1:12:00.721
Come on, come on.

1:13:17.565 --> 1:13:18.833
Olivia!

1:13:19.499 --> 1:13:20.701
There you are.

1:13:20.801 --> 1:13:22.069
You're up.

1:13:22.169 --> 1:13:23.037
Let's go.

1:13:30.311 --> 1:13:31.212
To Nationals!

1:13:31.312 --> 1:13:32.013
To Nationals!

1:13:34.048 --> 1:13:34.515
Wooh!

1:13:35.783 --> 1:13:38.786
- Oh my God.
- What?

1:13:38.886 --> 1:13:40.688
- Poor Izzy.
- What is it?

1:13:40.788 --> 1:13:42.290
Check Connect.

1:13:48.062 --> 1:13:49.230
This can't be real.

1:14:05.478 --> 1:14:07.480
Oh, Honey.

1:14:07.581 --> 1:14:11.018
I am so sorry, Baby.

1:14:16.390 --> 1:14:18.893
Honey, if you're up for it,

1:14:18.993 --> 1:14:21.461
a few officers stopped by
to ask you some questions.

1:14:21.562 --> 1:14:22.797
They're in the living room.

1:14:22.897 --> 1:14:23.496
Okay.

1:14:23.597 --> 1:14:26.200
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1:14:28.502 --> 1:14:30.972
I know this is a really
difficult time.

1:14:31.072 --> 1:14:34.342
We appreciate you being willing
to talk with us.

1:14:34.442 --> 1:14:36.911
Did you notice any changes in
Isabelle's demeanour

1:14:37.011 --> 1:14:38.179
last few weeks?

1:14:38.279 --> 1:14:41.048
Any mood swings,
unusual behavior?

1:14:43.250 --> 1:14:44.552
No.

1:14:44.652 --> 1:14:47.455
I wish I could say I did.

1:14:48.456 --> 1:14:53.194
We're all under a lot of stress
with college applications,

1:14:53.294 --> 1:14:56.230
but Izzy seemed to be handling
it really well.

1:14:57.798 --> 1:15:01.635
I guess I thought the same
thing about Jane.

1:15:01.736 --> 1:15:03.571
Well, we can never really know
what's goin' on

1:15:03.671 --> 1:15:05.606
in someone else's head.

1:15:06.741 --> 1:15:09.276
Can you tell us a bit about
your friendship with Isabelle?

1:15:10.611 --> 1:15:12.580
Yeah, um...

1:15:13.914 --> 1:15:16.917
...we've been neighbors forever.

1:15:17.018 --> 1:15:20.688
We used to be best friends
when we were younger.

1:15:20.788 --> 1:15:23.791
We only became close again
recently.

1:15:25.559 --> 1:15:28.029
I just can't believe she would
do this.

1:15:28.929 --> 1:15:31.032
She had so many people
who loved her.

1:15:34.735 --> 1:15:37.805
And what about your phone call
today?

1:15:42.643 --> 1:15:43.778
It was logged
that she called you

1:15:43.878 --> 1:15:46.280
shortly before her time
of death.

1:15:46.380 --> 1:15:48.049
What did she say?

1:15:52.620 --> 1:15:55.389
I was at a debate tournament.

1:15:55.489 --> 1:15:57.658
She called me
to wish me good luck.

1:15:57.758 --> 1:15:59.860
Oh, Sweetie,
don't

1:16:03.898 --> 1:16:06.233
Thank you again for your help.

1:16:06.333 --> 1:16:08.169
We're so sorry for your loss.

1:16:08.269 --> 1:16:10.571
We may get in touch again
as we learn more.

1:16:10.671 --> 1:16:12.507
I'll walk you out.

1:16:24.919 --> 1:16:27.088
It's always a tragedy
to lose someone so young

1:16:27.188 --> 1:16:28.789
and full of potential.

1:16:28.889 --> 1:16:30.658
And to have it happen twice
in one year

1:16:30.758 --> 1:16:33.828
is truly devastating.

1:16:33.928 --> 1:16:36.831
Isabelle was
such a special young woman

1:16:36.931 --> 1:16:39.266
and I know
we'll all miss her dearly.

1:16:41.302 --> 1:16:47.509
As for our current students,
there is always another option.

1:16:47.608 --> 1:16:49.043
We're here for you.

1:16:49.143 --> 1:16:52.680
And we'll be providing
mandatory grief counseling

1:16:52.780 --> 1:16:54.516
over the coming weeks.

1:16:54.615 --> 1:16:56.383
This stops here.

1:16:58.085 --> 1:17:02.323
Now let's take a moment
of silence for Izzy.

1:17:12.366 --> 1:17:14.835
Dear Stanford Admissions
Committee,

1:17:14.935 --> 1:17:17.171
thank you for taking the time
to reconsider my application

1:17:17.271 --> 1:17:19.039
following my deferral.

1:17:19.140 --> 1:17:21.543
I could tell you how much I've
always wanted to go to Stanford,

1:17:21.642 --> 1:17:23.444
how committed I am
to academic excellence,

1:17:23.545 --> 1:17:26.714
and how much time I've put into
extracurricular activities,

1:17:26.814 --> 1:17:28.649
but you already know all that.

1:17:28.749 --> 1:17:31.553
Instead, I'd like to talk
about my best friend,

1:17:31.652 --> 1:17:33.187
Isabelle Morris.

1:17:33.287 --> 1:17:35.723
Izzy was not only
an intelligent, driven woman,

1:17:35.823 --> 1:17:37.892
but she had
an undeniable charisma

1:17:37.992 --> 1:17:40.629
and an amazing ability
to bring people together.

1:17:40.728 --> 1:17:42.763
She taught me how to look
beyond my GPA

1:17:42.863 --> 1:17:45.534
and to connect
with those around me.

1:17:45.634 --> 1:17:48.469
Izzy took her own life.

1:17:48.570 --> 1:17:50.371
I don't know why she did it.

1:17:50.471 --> 1:17:52.940
I don't know what
I could have done to prevent it.

1:17:54.275 --> 1:17:57.044
But what I do know is
that she left an indelible mark

1:17:57.144 --> 1:17:58.412
upon my world.

1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:01.715
When I first applied,
I put down "Undeclared"

1:18:01.815 --> 1:18:03.083
on my application.

1:18:03.184 --> 1:18:05.452
Despite my extensive resume,
I had no idea

1:18:05.554 --> 1:18:07.188
what I wanted to do
with my life.

1:18:09.490 --> 1:18:11.091
Now I do.

1:18:11.192 --> 1:18:13.595
I want to help people
like Izzy.

1:18:13.727 --> 1:18:15.930
I want to study mental health.

1:18:16.030 --> 1:18:17.965
I want to be there for others
in the same way

1:18:18.065 --> 1:18:21.001
that Izzy was there for me.

1:18:21.101 --> 1:18:22.469
I wasn't really living my life

1:18:22.571 --> 1:18:24.271
until she took me
under her wing.

1:18:25.706 --> 1:18:28.209
I vow to continue Izzy's legacy.

1:18:29.810 --> 1:18:32.446
Thank you for your time
and consideration.

1:18:37.885 --> 1:18:41.021
Sincerely, Olivia Brooks.
