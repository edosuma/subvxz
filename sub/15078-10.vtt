HER NAME FROM CONSIDERATION.

BUT HER HUSBAND
WAS RYLAND'S MENTOR,

OF THE CAMPAIGN STAFF

ABOUT IT, AND NOBODY DID.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.518

32:06.592 --> 32:07.693

I CAN'T FIGURE OUT

32:07.726 --> 32:09.561
IS WHY THEY KILLED RYLAND

I'M ASSUMING YOUR FIRM GRASP
ON REALITY

40:03.635 --> 40:05.737
MEANS THAT YOU'RE TAKING
YOUR MEDS.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.005
YEAH,
I THOUGHT A PILL A DAY

40:07.038 --> 40:08.640
WAS SUPPOSED TO KEEP
THE DOCTOR AWAY.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.742
MAX TOLD ME
WHERE TO FIND YOU.

40:10.776 --> 40:14.780
I CAME BY TO SAY
THAT THE MEDS AREN'T ENOUGH.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.114
IF YOU WANT
TO STAY HEALTHY,

40:16.147 --> 40:17.549
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
REGULAR TALK THERAPY.

40:17.583 --> 40:18.850
AND APPARENTLY,
YOU MAKE HOUSE CALLS.

40:18.884 --> 40:22.053
ACTUALLY,
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

40:22.087 --> 40:25.023
GIVEN YOUR
LONG-STANDING...

40:25.056 --> 40:27.459
RELATIONSHIP WITH NATALIE,

40:27.493 --> 40:29.728
I DON'T THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE

40:29.761 --> 40:31.797
FOR ME TO CONTINUE TO BE
YOUR PSYCHIATRIST.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.999
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
RECOMMEND SOMEBODY

40:34.032 --> 40:35.934
WHO'S NOT
AN INSUFFERABLE BORE.

40:35.967 --> 40:39.204
JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T BE
YOUR DOCTOR

40:39.237 --> 40:42.741
DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T BE YOUR FRIEND.

40:42.774 --> 40:46.111
IF YOU NEED ONE.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.850
I CAN'T HELP WONDERING...

40:51.883 --> 40:54.152
IF I HAD ACTUALLY
HAD THE NERVE

40:54.185 --> 40:56.922
TO APPROACH YOU
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO,

40:56.955 --> 40:59.858
WOULD YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
THE TIME OF DAY?

41:00.992 --> 41:04.129
I DON'T KNOW.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.732
BUT ONE THING YOU'LL FIND OUT
PRETTY QUICK

41:06.765 --> 41:08.867
IS THAT I'M NOBODY'S
FANTASY GIRL.

41:13.939 --> 41:16.608
47 ACROSS -- PARASOL.

41:20.879 --> 41:21.980
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

41:22.013 --> 41:23.715
UM, IF WE'RE
GONNA BE FRIENDS,

41:23.749 --> 41:25.717
ONE THING YOU'LL FIGURE OUT
PRETTY QUICK

41:25.751 --> 41:27.753
IS THAT I MAY NEED HELP
ONCE IN A WHILE,

41:27.786 --> 41:30.255
BUT I REALLY HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE
GIVE ME THE ANSWERS.

41:30.288 --> 41:33.625
SOMETIMES
THE BILLIONS OF NEURONS

41:33.659 --> 41:38.697
FIRING IN OUR BRAINS HELP US
CONCOCT ELABORATE SCENARIOS.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.868
WE IMAGINE OURSELVES
WITH A DREAM GIRL

41:42.901 --> 41:44.836
OR LANDING A DREAM JOB --

41:44.870 --> 41:48.607
AN ASTRONAUT, ROCK STAR,

41:48.640 --> 41:50.876
EVEN A UNITED STATES SENATOR.

41:50.909 --> 41:54.746
BUT FANTASIES CAN TURN DARK.

41:54.780 --> 41:59.150
WE START TO BELIEVE
THERE'S A MONSTER UNDER THE BED

41:59.184 --> 42:03.989
OR THAT EVIL FORCES ARE ALIGNING
THEMSELVES AGAINST US.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.958
ALL THESE FANTASIES --
GOOD AND BAD --

42:06.992 --> 42:09.895
STEM FROM
AN EVOLUTIONARY IMPERATIVE.

42:09.928 --> 42:13.164
OUR BRAINS ARE EXPLORING
POTENTIAL OUTCOMES

42:13.198 --> 42:17.168
THAT MIGHT HELP US ACHIEVE
OUR GOALS OR AVOID DANGER.

42:17.202 --> 42:21.673
BUT IF WE ALLOW FANTASY
TO OVERTAKE OUR THINKING...

42:24.209 --> 42:29.915
...WE CAN MISS THE REALITY
THAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US.

42:29.948 --> 42:33.184
AND SOMETIMES...

42:33.218 --> 42:37.088
REALITY'S NOT SO BAD.
