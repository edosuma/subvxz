WEBVTT

00:17.018 --> 00:19.384
Your move, pumpkin.

00:19.562 --> 00:21.848
I'm thinking.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.352
( panting )

00:35.203 --> 00:37.694
Mitch, grab that.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.120
Go on.
(grunts)

01:03.898 --> 01:05.809
Governor:
You can't think forever.

01:05.983 --> 01:09.271
Sooner or later,
you've got to make a move.

01:10.321 --> 01:13.188
You never let me win anyway.

01:13.366 --> 01:16.233
Well, that wouldn't be winning.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.701
That's what my daddy used to say.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.249
He used to beat me at chess, too.

01:29.173 --> 01:31.539
Heck, he used to beat me at everything.

01:48.234 --> 01:50.600
You know this guy?

01:52.571 --> 01:55.028
Was your dad mean?

01:55.199 --> 01:57.360
Sometimes.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.446
Were you bad?

02:01.539 --> 02:03.450
Sometimes.

02:12.258 --> 02:14.544
So you've been on the road
all this time?

02:17.221 --> 02:19.086
Yeah.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.302
Lily:
You okay, Brian?

02:41.245 --> 02:43.236
What is it, pumpkin?

02:44.957 --> 02:47.369
Am I bad?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.830
What?

02:51.005 --> 02:52.870
Hey.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.506
Why would you think that?

02:57.803 --> 03:01.295
My dad was always mean to me.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.341
Hey, you're good.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.469
You are.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.682
We've got a camp
about a half a mile from here.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.722
Hell, no, Martinez.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.641
We got too many mouths as it is.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.480
They got a kid, for Christ's sake.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.270
Hey, if you do come back with us,
there's two things you got to accept.

03:18.449 --> 03:20.360
One, I'm in charge.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.911
Two, no deadweight.

03:23.079 --> 03:25.741
That goes for everyone.

03:29.001 --> 03:32.539
Contribute or be cast out.

03:34.131 --> 03:38.090
Can you live with that, Brian?

03:40.805 --> 03:42.887
Governor:
You, me, your mom, and Aunt Tara,

03:43.057 --> 03:45.013
we're gonna be okay.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.345
'Cause we're good?

03:47.520 --> 03:49.181
All of us?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.747
Yourturn.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.460
Bﬁan?

04:24.390 --> 04:26.255
It's your turn.

04:31.272 --> 04:33.388
I'm thinking.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.102
(wind blowing)

04:52.376 --> 04:55.709
(theme music playing )

05:33.709 --> 05:35.791
Lily:
You going out there today?

05:35.961 --> 05:38.247
Supply run.

05:38.422 --> 05:41.209
Martinez and the Dolgen brothers.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.256
(sighs)

05:53.437 --> 05:55.928
I'm gonna set up a nurses' station
for the camp.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.607
They need one.

05:59.652 --> 06:02.564
- I'm sorry, Lily. This place is--
- Stop it.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.480
I wanted something better for us.

06:05.658 --> 06:08.024
This camp is good.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.193
We'll make it better.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.048
How's the fishing?

06:29.223 --> 06:31.635
There isn't any.
Pond's dead.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.639
As a doornail.

06:35.813 --> 06:40.603
We still got rabbits, skunks,
some possum out here.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.518
You better watch your ass, One Eye Bri.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.368
Mitch: You sure we're headed
in the right direction?

06:56.542 --> 06:58.703
Martinez:
If Howard's map is right.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.163
Mitch: We should have dragged
his ass out here to make sure.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.203
He's an old man.
He can barely walk.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.088
That's why I said dragged.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.795
Hope this is worth it.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.301
Supposedly this guy
was a survivalist type.

07:09.471 --> 07:11.257
His cabin might have stuff we can use.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.263
Hell, maybe he's still alive.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.140
I won't keep my fingers crossed.

07:19.398 --> 07:22.765
Hey, One Eye. What you doing?

07:50.554 --> 07:52.715
The hell is this?

07:52.890 --> 07:55.347
Mitch:
Somebody pissed somebody off.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.843
Who gives a shit?

07:59.021 --> 08:01.888
That guy's got nothing
to worry about anymore.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.602
Let's go.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.647
- It's a deep cut.
- No, that's nothing, ma'am.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.813
ljust got cute with my knife,
that's all. I'll be fine.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.993
So...

08:16.163 --> 08:17.699
Alicia.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.410
Alicia. Right.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.996
You in the Marines or something?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.502
Army. In the reserves.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.709
An M4, huh?

08:31.512 --> 08:32.843
You don't approve?

08:33.013 --> 08:36.050
I mean, don't get me wrong,

08:36.225 --> 08:38.181
an M4 is great for close combat,

08:38.352 --> 08:40.684
but as a field weapon?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.937
With all that dirt and dust,
no, thanks.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.979
I've never really been
into big guns anyway.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.109
I'm more of a Smith & Wesson gal.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.067
Less fuss, you know?

08:53.242 --> 08:55.358
You always this full of shit?

08:55.536 --> 08:56.946
( laughs)

08:58.038 --> 08:59.869
Yes, I am.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.524
Took himself out.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.778
You think he's the one
who 86'd those military guys?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.940
- He still has his head.
- Some of it, anyway.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.451
Let's see what he's got inside.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.013
(tapping )

10:43.143 --> 10:45.054
- ( whistles )
- ( banging )

10:45.229 --> 10:48.312
You hear that?
There's one in there.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.723
Must be stuck if it ain't coming out.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.687
We going in?

10:52.861 --> 10:55.147
You want us to wait till you finish
pissing in your pants?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.687
- No, I'm--
- Cut the chatter.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.730
( bangs)

11:00.577 --> 11:02.738
Hey. Let's go.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.893
( banging continues)

11:44.246 --> 11:47.204
(banging)

11:56.884 --> 11:59.717
- It's close.
- Quiet.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.680
(banging)

12:04.808 --> 12:07.220
(banging)

12:31.877 --> 12:34.960
-( bangs)
- ( door creaks open )

12:35.130 --> 12:37.416
- It's out.
- Shut up.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.502
-(snaﬂs)
- Oh! Get it off of me!

12:39.676 --> 12:41.587
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

12:41.762 --> 12:43.753
Get it off of me!

12:58.111 --> 13:00.648
Jeez!

13:02.783 --> 13:03.943
Pete!

13:05.702 --> 13:07.283
( floorboards creak )

13:07.454 --> 13:09.786
-(snaﬂs)
-(gaspS)

13:38.694 --> 13:40.810
Martinez:
If it was just you in that pit,

13:40.988 --> 13:44.947
I wouldn't have brought
you into the camp.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.859
If it weren't for the people
you were with...

13:49.329 --> 13:51.320
the girl...

14:00.173 --> 14:02.789
You seem different now.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.708
Changed.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.802
Are you?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.846
lam.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.347
Good.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.684
The guy had some good stuff.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.738
Canned food.

14:28.201 --> 14:32.035
Ooh. We got beer.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.874
( whistles )

14:42.883 --> 14:45.716
( laughs)

14:50.223 --> 14:52.635
Pete:
Man, what happened here?

14:52.809 --> 14:55.551
I mean, what the hell
was going on in this cabin?

14:55.729 --> 14:57.560
Was he storing those biters?

14:57.731 --> 14:59.722
They were his wife and kid, man.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.733
Pete:
No, they were biters.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.565
What about those heads?

15:05.739 --> 15:08.731
Belonged to the guys who did
the wrong thing to the wrong man.

15:08.909 --> 15:12.401
Probably best not to think
too much about it.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.911
Better listen to One Eye Bri, Pete.

15:17.501 --> 15:20.459
I can never tell if he's winking
or blinking.

15:22.631 --> 15:25.919
But you know how to regulate,
don't you, Bri?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.806
He was always like this, Martinez?

15:31.973 --> 15:35.340
Oh, yeah. Ice in the veins.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.601
You should have seen him
back in the day.

15:37.771 --> 15:38.760
What about you fellas, huh?

15:38.939 --> 15:40.930
What did you do before it all changed?

15:41.108 --> 15:43.099
l was...

15:43.276 --> 15:45.358
l was an ice cream truck driver.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.269
( laughs)

15:47.447 --> 15:49.779
Till I upgraded my life

15:49.950 --> 15:53.784
and I became a tank operator
for the US Army.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.694
Hoo-ah!

15:55.872 --> 15:57.328
Hoo-ah.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.581
Then when everything went tits up,

15:59.751 --> 16:02.037
I got the hell out
and took my ride with me.

16:03.547 --> 16:08.007
End of the world don't mean shit
when you got a tank.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.214
l was Army, too.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.755
Stationed out of Fort Benning.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.299
Stayed for a while after it all started.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.809
That's my Pete.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.891
He's too loyal to bounce.

16:24.401 --> 16:25.982
What about you, Brian?

16:26.153 --> 16:28.360
What did you do when it all went bad?

16:30.699 --> 16:32.906
I survived.

16:42.794 --> 16:45.001
(laughing)

16:45.172 --> 16:47.504
Wait, your father was a Catholic priest?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.005
That's right.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.757
So the father became a daddy?

16:50.927 --> 16:53.839
lt caused some problems
with the Church a little bit.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.175
This is all stuff Brian's heard before.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.010
We spent a lot of time
out there together.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.927
You've done all right here.
I mean this camp.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.686
It's the first time I've felt safe
since all this started.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.018
The place Brian and I lived
before kind of worked.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.524
I guess I wanted that again.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.355
Sounds like your old camp
was pretty sweet.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.565
Alicia:
You guys had walls, right?

17:12.991 --> 17:15.198
Yeah. Yeah, it was...

17:15.368 --> 17:17.279
it was a good place.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.446
Megan:
This place is good, too, right?

17:20.624 --> 17:23.115
Martinez:
You know it.

17:23.293 --> 17:25.079
I want to hear all about it someday.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.754
Brian won't say a word.

17:26.922 --> 17:29.288
I say leave the past in the past.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.545
Tara:
Well, for the first time in a long time,

17:33.720 --> 17:35.460
- l'm shitfaced.
- Lily: Tara.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.551
Sorry. Megan,
don't say that, okay?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.137
- You want to get out of here?
- Yeah.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.393
Thanks for the dinner.
Double thanks for the suds.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.020
Yeah. Boom.
There you go.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.315
( kisses )

17:49.486 --> 17:51.943
- Be safe.
- Tara: Yep.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.649
lthink, um--
lthink I'm gonna go.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.236
You sure?
I got a couple of skunky beers left.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.955
Whoa.
( laughing )

18:02.666 --> 18:04.577
I'm good, thanks.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.702
Brian, the roof's leaking again.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.088
You should fix that, man.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.124
I'll do that.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.337
Later, muﬁeca.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.681
( Governor sighs)

18:30.527 --> 18:32.518
( knocks )

18:40.328 --> 18:43.161
Almost forgot.
Got a surprise for you.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.618
Whoa.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.546
Martinez:
Aw, damn it.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.712
Hand me another one.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.517
You know he's dead, right?

19:06.688 --> 19:09.145
Shumpert?

19:09.316 --> 19:12.058
He was never the same after Woodbury.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.526
Oh!

19:15.697 --> 19:18.985
Yeah. He got reckless.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.659
Biter took a piece of him
right over there.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.368
I swear, he didn't try
to get out of the way.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.874
I put him down myself.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.502
Right over there.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.129
I'm sorry.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.258
There's some things
you just can't come back from.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.259
They become a part of who you are.

19:40.430 --> 19:42.591
Either you live with them or you don't.

19:42.766 --> 19:45.599
Well, you seem to be living with them
pretty well.

19:45.769 --> 19:48.010
( laughs )
So are you.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.522
That family,
they brought you back.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.189
You're lucky. I couldn't--

19:57.364 --> 20:00.106
I couldn't do that again.
Couldn't risk it.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.740
Couldn't sleep at night
knowing I was gonna lose them.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.742
I'm not gonna lose them.

20:04.913 --> 20:06.699
Yeah.

20:09.834 --> 20:13.952
What, you don't think
you can keep this place safe?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.711
I'll try.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.919
Hopefully we'll be prepared
for whatever comes.

20:21.054 --> 20:25.388
Now you're here,
maybe we can share the crown a little.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.888
Oh, Jesus.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.226
I should have taken some golf lessons
before the--

20:36.277 --> 20:39.405
(groaning)

20:39.572 --> 20:42.154
(groaning continues)

20:53.503 --> 20:55.459
( screams )

20:58.508 --> 21:01.341
( panting )

21:01.511 --> 21:03.001
(golf club thuds)

21:06.349 --> 21:08.635
Come on, let's go.

21:10.687 --> 21:13.178
(walkers snarling )

21:15.316 --> 21:17.102
Come on.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.942
I don't wanna do it!

21:24.117 --> 21:25.698
(screaming )

21:25.869 --> 21:28.110
I don't want it!
I don't want it!

21:28.288 --> 21:30.279
(shouts)

21:30.457 --> 21:32.448
You hear me?
I don't want it, damn it!

21:32.625 --> 21:34.832
(screaming )

21:41.468 --> 21:43.504
I don't want it.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.589
( flesh tearing )

21:45.763 --> 21:47.845
I don't want it.

22:02.322 --> 22:03.903
(crying)

22:04.073 --> 22:07.281
- ( door opens)
- Brian, we're home!

22:07.452 --> 22:09.238
Lily:
Megan, he's sleeping.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.989
Bﬁan?

22:14.167 --> 22:16.909
You're shaking.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.414
What is it?

22:24.219 --> 22:26.676
ljust had a bad dream, that's all.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.349
What was it?

22:38.942 --> 22:41.228
I can't remember.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.854
Listen up!

22:46.032 --> 22:50.446
We found what was left of Martinez
in a pit this morning.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.111
(crowd murmuring)

22:53.289 --> 22:55.541
Looks like he was
hitting some golf balls,

22:55.708 --> 22:57.619
he got drunk,

22:57.794 --> 22:59.409
he fell in.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.454
(crowd murmuring)

23:02.632 --> 23:05.044
So now what?

23:06.469 --> 23:07.970
I'm taking leadership of the camp.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.423
- Crowd: No. No.
- Hold on now. Hold on now!

23:10.598 --> 23:13.385
We should vote on who leads, right?

23:13.560 --> 23:16.051
- Yeah.
- You can't just take over.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.220
- Shut your mouth, you little bitch.
- What?

23:18.398 --> 23:20.684
- Hey!
- Pete: Hey, calm down!

23:20.858 --> 23:22.598
Calm down, all of you.

23:26.531 --> 23:30.069
We need each other
now more than ever.

23:30.243 --> 23:34.657
The only way we get through this,
through any of this, is together.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.118
Now this is temporary.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.955
We'll find some kind of way to do a vote
in the next couple of days.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.414
For now, it's business as usual.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.752
- Okay?
- ( crowd murmuring)

23:51.014 --> 23:53.596
You heard the man.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.301
Move!

24:00.273 --> 24:02.264
Please?

24:03.526 --> 24:05.482
Gear up.
We're going on a hunt.

24:09.449 --> 24:13.158
Pete:
Rationing, fences, medical supplies.

24:13.328 --> 24:17.116
There are 100 questions and people
are looking to me for answers.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.656
Well, it's hard to lead.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.041
Yeah, I could use some help.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.455
Hey.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.462
( people chatting )

24:46.235 --> 24:47.736
How many?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.561
10.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.197
Maybe less.

24:53.368 --> 24:56.485
They got a lot of supplies, though.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.328
Maybe we should take 'em in.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.330
Are you crazy?

25:01.501 --> 25:04.083
We barely got enough
to go around as it is.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.997
Look, Pete, I know you don't want
to hurt nobody.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.507
Neither do I,
but we need those supplies.

25:11.678 --> 25:15.011
Now let's just go over there
and take what we need and go home.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.842
No rough stuff.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.347
- You want to rob 'em?
- Why not?

25:18.518 --> 25:20.554
We need their stuff.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.271
They got guns,
but if we roll up on 'em quick--

25:25.441 --> 25:27.352
No.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.485
No, we can find our own supplies.

25:30.655 --> 25:32.145
Come on.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.839
- What a joke.
- We did all right.

25:56.013 --> 25:59.050
Yeah, a couple of damn squirrels,
some condensed milk.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.011
What do you want from me?
I'm trying here.

26:08.276 --> 26:09.857
Hey.

26:10.027 --> 26:11.528
Where you going?

26:32.425 --> 26:34.711
Son of a bitch.

26:34.886 --> 26:37.423
Son of a bitch!

26:38.890 --> 26:41.131
This wasn't biters.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.597
People did this.
Must have just happened.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.477
We would have had those supplies.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.434
You're worried about supplies?
These people are dead, Mitch.

26:49.609 --> 26:50.940
You're damn right they're dead!

26:51.110 --> 26:52.816
That was gonna happen either way.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.444
Now some other group's got our stuff.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.111
( moaning weakly )

27:04.457 --> 27:06.789
Mitch. Mitch, no!

27:20.848 --> 27:22.964
He might have lived.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.133
Might have.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.497
Here you go. Need this?

27:54.006 --> 27:55.837
Brian, what's going on?

27:56.008 --> 27:58.169
- Pack your things, now.
- What's happening?

27:58.344 --> 28:01.177
- Lily: Hold on, baby.
- Hey.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.180
Grab your clothes, pack some food.
Come on.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.760
Mommy?

28:05.935 --> 28:08.017
- Brian, stop.
- Get Tara.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.179
We need to leave.
It isn't safe here anymore.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.689
What are you talking about?

28:13.860 --> 28:15.691
We can'tjust run off.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.604
I'm the only nurse in camp.
Tara's got Alicia.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.317
What about Megan?

28:20.491 --> 28:23.028
Look, things are about to go
very wrong here.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.864
It's happened to me before.
I can't put you and Megan through that.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.994
Can't lose you again.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.537
What about Pete?

28:31.711 --> 28:33.201
You said he was a good man.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.620
- Well, l was wrong.
- But...

28:35.798 --> 28:38.255
Do you trust me?

28:38.426 --> 28:40.212
Do you trust me, Lily?

28:43.180 --> 28:45.557
Then pack your things.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.716
We're leaving tonight, okay?

28:47.894 --> 28:49.680
Come on.

28:49.854 --> 28:52.311
Mommy.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.346
Mommy.

28:57.069 --> 28:58.400
Alicia:
Where are we going?

28:58.571 --> 29:00.562
- Tara: Alicia.
- Maybe you should slow down.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.696
No, I don't understand this.
I don't understand this.

29:02.867 --> 29:04.482
Tara:
Hey, we're together, okay?

29:04.660 --> 29:07.402
We have everything back there.
We have food, we have shelter.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.070
- ( tires skid )
- ( gasps )

29:09.248 --> 29:12.240
(walkers snarling )

29:12.418 --> 29:15.000
- Brian.
- Oh, my God.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.253
Just stay in the car.

29:19.008 --> 29:21.715
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( slopping )

30:49.849 --> 30:51.339
What are you doing?

30:56.022 --> 30:58.354
Surviving.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.142
( door opens)

31:15.708 --> 31:17.699
( knocks )

31:22.548 --> 31:24.914
We need to talk.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.208
About Mitch.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.219
Come in.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.725
I knew this was coming.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.884
I've been getting him
out of trouble my--

31:36.062 --> 31:39.054
( muffled cries )

31:48.741 --> 31:52.404
Shh. Shh.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.604
Where's Pete?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.120
He's dead.

32:37.915 --> 32:40.247
You gonna kill me, too, now?

32:41.877 --> 32:44.744
Huh? For the old guy at the camp?

32:58.144 --> 32:59.680
Smoke?

33:02.565 --> 33:04.476
Why did you do my brother?

33:04.650 --> 33:07.483
You were right about that camp.
We should have taken their supplies.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.361
I don't care that you killed
the old man.

33:11.532 --> 33:14.899
Men like your brother,
always doing the right thing,

33:15.077 --> 33:18.035
even at the cost of their own people.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.161
Go on. Have a cigarette.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.451
lquit.

33:26.589 --> 33:28.500
Yeah, me, too.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.087
I remember the first smoke I ever had.

33:32.261 --> 33:34.343
Me and my brother
huddled in the garage

33:34.513 --> 33:37.346
puffing on one of my dad's
Lucky Strikes.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.007
He must have smelled the smoke,
because he came barging in

33:40.186 --> 33:42.142
looking to beat up on us.

33:42.313 --> 33:44.520
But my brother got between us.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.816
Said he stole them.

33:48.986 --> 33:52.228
Wasn't true. It was me.

33:52.406 --> 33:54.863
But that was my brother.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.694
Hero.

34:02.416 --> 34:05.533
He got two black eyes
and a broken rib for that.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.202
And I got beat anyway.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.540
Take one.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.776
I'm running things now,

34:36.951 --> 34:40.569
and I will do everything it takes
to protect this camp.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.904
Now, if you join me,

34:44.083 --> 34:46.665
I promise you you will never have to
worry about whether you were doing

34:46.835 --> 34:48.621
the right thing or the wrong thing.

34:48.796 --> 34:52.254
Because we will do

34:52.424 --> 34:55.416
the only thing.

35:19.034 --> 35:22.777
Mitch: What are we gonna tell
the camp about Pete?

35:24.415 --> 35:27.703
Governor: We'll tell them
he died on a supply run,

35:27.876 --> 35:29.958
saving our asses.

35:35.384 --> 35:38.251
Mitch: You think they're really
gonna believe that?

35:38.429 --> 35:40.511
Governor: People believe
what they want to believe.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.100
Everybody loves a hero.

35:56.864 --> 35:58.900
( chatter)

36:02.411 --> 36:04.242
Governor:
How's the perimeter coming?

36:04.413 --> 36:06.825
Alicia: It's good. We got cars ringing
almost the entire camp.

36:06.999 --> 36:09.706
I think a few more runs, we should
have ourselves a nice little buffer.

36:09.877 --> 36:10.866
Governor:
And the pits?

36:11.045 --> 36:12.581
Mitch: They keep coming,
we keep burning them.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.040
I don't know
if it's the heat or what,

36:14.214 --> 36:15.875
but there have been a hell
of a lot more of them lately.

36:16.050 --> 36:17.381
- And the armory?
- Solid.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.587
l rounded up
all the ammo in camp.

36:19.762 --> 36:22.003
We're officially stocked
in the bullet department.

36:22.181 --> 36:25.924
Still, tell your crews supply runs
are arrow only from now on.

36:26.101 --> 36:27.762
Gunshots are a luxury.

36:27.936 --> 36:29.551
Sooner or later
we're gonna need 'em.

36:29.730 --> 36:33.097
That's right,
and not just for the biters.

36:33.275 --> 36:36.893
Mitch and l and Pete, we saw
what people can do out there.

36:37.071 --> 36:40.063
You come across strangers,
you just avoid them.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.367
Come back here and tell us
where you saw them, okay?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.616
Let's go.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.368
(whispering )

36:54.296 --> 36:55.797
(sighs)

37:02.096 --> 37:04.633
Maybe we can find a better place.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.729
You know, if...

37:13.899 --> 37:16.231
we're willing to fight for it.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.901
We don't need to find a better place.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.692
This is home.

37:37.506 --> 37:38.837
You're it, Aunt Tara.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.963
What? I can't be it.
I'm on guard duty.

37:41.135 --> 37:43.501
l have to be a responsible adult.

37:43.679 --> 37:45.920
- You're it.
- Go get her.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.554
- No fair!
- Run, Megan.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.260
( laughs)

38:23.677 --> 38:25.963
You don't have to do this alone.

38:34.188 --> 38:35.519
Caught you.

38:35.689 --> 38:38.146
- ( snarling )
- ( screaming )

38:44.114 --> 38:46.901
Aunt Tara!
( screaming )

38:47.075 --> 38:48.326
Megan!

38:49.328 --> 38:52.240
Aunt Tara! No!

38:52.414 --> 38:54.575
(screaming )

39:02.508 --> 39:04.339
(gunshot)

39:04.510 --> 39:07.047
- Mommy!
- Megan!

39:07.221 --> 39:10.088
- Man: It's your fault!
- Woman: It's not.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.520
It's okay. It's okay.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.647
It's okay.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.997
( chatter)

42:10.320 --> 42:12.276
(cocks gun)

42:23.208 --> 42:26.041
(theme music playing )
