JAKE:
So, to make a long story short,

00:06.745 --> 00:08.240
they say it's my fault
for leaving the pistol

00:08.340 --> 00:09.673
on the seat of the Jeep.

00:09.675 --> 00:12.242
I say it's the general's fault
for sitting on it.

00:13.594 --> 00:16.980
But either way, I'm not allowed
to have a gun for a while.

00:16.982 --> 00:21.351
And a weary nation
breathes a sigh of relief.

00:21.353 --> 00:22.986
Yeah, yeah, terrific.

00:22.988 --> 00:24.871
Um, so, they've got you working
in the kitchen?

00:24.873 --> 00:26.256
Yeah, we call it the mess.

00:26.258 --> 00:29.059
SERGEANT: That corn's not
gonna cream itself, Harper!

00:29.061 --> 00:30.544
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

00:30.546 --> 00:32.162
Uh, I got to go back to work

00:32.164 --> 00:34.331

against terrorists and whatnot.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.099
Take care
of yourself, buddy.

00:36.101 --> 00:37.517
Don't worry, Dad.

00:37.519 --> 00:39.970
I'm being all I can be.

00:41.222 --> 00:42.856
Wow.

00:42.858 --> 00:44.024
Yeah.

00:44.026 --> 00:46.193
Seems like just yesterday
he was an adorable,

00:46.195 --> 00:48.061
chubby-cheeked little boy
catching a Frisbee

00:48.063 --> 00:49.563
on the beach in Santa Monica.

00:49.565 --> 00:51.715
Now he's a fuzz-faced
buck private

00:51.717 --> 00:54.785
catching the clap from
a whore in Tijuana.

00:54.787 --> 00:56.837
WALDEN:
Hey, guys.

00:56.839 --> 00:59.039
What do you think?

00:59.041 --> 01:00.791
Oh, yummy.

01:02.510 --> 01:04.044
You look like
the maitre d' in heaven.

01:04.046 --> 01:07.130
What's the occasion?

01:07.132 --> 01:08.248
It's Zoey's birthday.

01:08.250 --> 01:09.499
Oh, well,
tell her happy birthday.

01:09.501 --> 01:10.550
What are you gonna give her?

01:10.552 --> 01:11.918
The rest of my life.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.036
Beg your pardon?

01:13.038 --> 01:14.537
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

01:14.539 --> 01:16.389
Hello.
Are you serious?

01:16.391 --> 01:17.707
Absolutely.

01:17.709 --> 01:20.010
Wow, wow, that's, uh...

01:20.012 --> 01:22.562
What he's trying to say is,
once you're married,

01:22.564 --> 01:23.847
where's he gonna live?

01:23.849 --> 01:26.483
No, no, stop, please.

01:26.485 --> 01:28.051
No, what I'm
trying to say is,

01:28.053 --> 01:30.821
I think it's wonderful,
and I'm very happy for you.

01:30.823 --> 01:32.405
I figured, why not, you know?

01:32.407 --> 01:34.407
I mean, I love her,
I love her daughter.

01:34.409 --> 01:36.226
Yeah, it's win-win
for everybody.

01:36.228 --> 01:39.362
Gonna miss you.

01:39.364 --> 01:42.115
Hey, I don't want
to get ahead of myself,

01:42.117 --> 01:45.869
but I was hoping
you'd be my best man.

01:45.871 --> 01:48.121
Oh, uh, Walden,

01:48.123 --> 01:50.624
I'd be honored to be
the best man at your wedding.

01:52.126 --> 01:53.777
(chuckles)

01:53.779 --> 01:56.046
What's so funny?

01:56.048 --> 01:59.549
You wouldn't be the best man
at the Dinah Shore Golf Classic.

01:59.551 --> 02:01.468
(chuckles)

02:02.587 --> 02:04.471
All right, you can be
the maid of honor.

02:04.473 --> 02:05.856
(laughs)

02:05.858 --> 02:07.057
Okay, I got to go.

02:07.059 --> 02:08.725
Good luck with Zoey.

02:08.727 --> 02:10.610
Oh, thanks, but I mean,

02:10.612 --> 02:12.612
come on.

02:13.948 --> 02:15.431
How about that?

02:15.433 --> 02:16.933
The kid's getting married.

02:16.935 --> 02:18.485
Yeah. Crazy, huh?

02:18.487 --> 02:21.288
If I looked like him, I wouldn't
take myself off the market.

02:21.290 --> 02:23.073
Is that so?

02:23.075 --> 02:25.709
Oh, yeah, I'd be out
there every night

02:25.711 --> 02:28.295
wearing my penis
down to a nub.

02:30.031 --> 02:33.834
It would look
like a golf pencil.

Hi, Alan.

Uh, yes, bring him in.

06:25.921 --> 06:27.921
What happened?

06:27.923 --> 06:30.790
She said no.

06:30.792 --> 06:33.210
Oh, oh, Walden, I am so sorry.

06:34.345 --> 06:37.097
When I proposed, she just ran
out of the restaurant.

06:37.099 --> 06:39.966
Now she won't return my calls

06:39.968 --> 06:41.935
or e-mails or texts.

06:41.937 --> 06:43.770
It's like she's ignoring me

06:43.772 --> 06:46.473
across the entire
digital spectrum.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.860
It's like she's Amish.

06:49.862 --> 06:51.561
So...

06:51.563 --> 06:53.096
you went out drinking

06:53.098 --> 06:55.782
and ended up
picking up Michael Bolton?

06:55.784 --> 06:57.267
No.

06:57.269 --> 07:00.287
I hired him to sing
while I was proposing.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.956
I should've gone
with Josh Groban.

07:02.958 --> 07:05.825
Wait, you're gonna
blame me for this?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.747

08:33.231 --> 08:35.198

08:35.200 --> 08:37.033
it's usually

08:52.100 --> 08:54.100
"No."

09:35.894 --> 09:37.927
more than life itself

09:48.323 --> 09:50.240
When a woman says,

to know, but trust me,

09:52.160 --> 09:53.376

You're right.

10:02.054 --> 10:04.003

10:09.845 --> 10:11.227

10:18.937 --> 10:20.904
with guys who are down
on their luck,

10:20.906 --> 10:24.307
why don't you just shack up
with my loser friend?

10:29.864 --> 10:31.197
Um,

10:31.199 --> 10:32.449
I'm actually not available.

10:44.336 --> 10:46.687
Wait a minute,
there's another guy?

10:46.689 --> 10:47.688
Yep.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.523
Better than Walden?

10:49.525 --> 10:50.908
Apparently.

10:50.910 --> 10:52.442
I'm sorry,

10:52.444 --> 10:54.728
unless this new guy can fly
around the room

10:54.730 --> 10:56.846
and shoot fire out his ass,

10:56.848 --> 10:59.700
that bitch is crazy.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.451
Hey.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.370
Well, hey,
look who's finally up.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.655
How you feeling, buddy?

11:04.657 --> 11:06.356
A little hungover.

11:06.358 --> 11:08.208
Berta, you got
any pot brownies?

11:08.210 --> 11:11.628
Until they cure glaucoma.

11:12.797 --> 11:15.048
Thanks.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.416
You want a glass of milk

11:16.418 --> 11:17.885
or something
to wash that down with?

11:17.887 --> 11:19.253
No, I'm good. Thanks.

11:19.255 --> 11:22.306
Instead of getting loaded,
maybe you want to talk about it?

11:22.308 --> 11:26.009
(garbled): What is there
to talk about, Alan?

11:26.011 --> 11:28.262
She's with another guy!

11:28.264 --> 11:31.715
I changed my mind
about the milk.

11:31.717 --> 11:37.187
I mean, how can another
guy give her anything

11:37.189 --> 11:38.555
that I can't give her?

11:38.557 --> 11:41.408
Maybe he doesn't talk
with his mouth full.

11:42.893 --> 11:45.028
You know what?

11:45.030 --> 11:47.247
I don't think the other
guy <i>can</i> give her

11:47.249 --> 11:48.282
anything I can't.

11:48.284 --> 11:49.733
Well, you're probably right.

11:49.735 --> 11:51.168
Probably?

11:53.738 --> 11:55.122
Definitely!

11:56.291 --> 11:58.575
You know what?
Let's just make a list.

11:58.577 --> 12:00.910
Okay, here we go.
Look at this.

12:00.912 --> 12:02.796
Walden... and the other guy.

12:02.798 --> 12:04.464
Let's just call him "Dick."

12:04.466 --> 12:06.916
Okay.

12:06.918 --> 12:08.885
Ability to provide.

12:08.887 --> 12:10.187
Walden-- billionaire.

12:10.189 --> 12:12.105
Dick? Less.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.808
That's one point for me.

12:14.810 --> 12:15.859
Okay, looks.

12:15.861 --> 12:16.944
You win.

12:16.946 --> 12:20.097
Thank you, Berta.

12:20.099 --> 12:21.982
I didn't want to say so
myself.

12:21.984 --> 12:23.984
Oh! Humility.

12:23.986 --> 12:25.819
That's two more checks for me.

12:26.904 --> 12:29.906
Okay, what else? Oh, just
an all-around great guy.

12:29.908 --> 12:31.458
Everybody likes me.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.210
Who likes Dick?

12:38.416 --> 12:41.218
Um...
Berta, please.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.389
Oh, God.

12:45.391 --> 12:48.125
Zoey likes Dick.

12:49.010 --> 12:51.812
Who am I kidding?

12:51.814 --> 12:54.114
Zoey loves Dick!

12:55.767 --> 12:57.150
Oh, hey, hey.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.820
Take it easy.

13:07.195 --> 13:09.196
I miss her, Alan.

13:09.198 --> 13:10.998
I miss the way
she looks at me.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.416
Yeah.

13:12.418 --> 13:13.817
Her smile.

13:13.819 --> 13:15.669
Sure, sure.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.689
Her hair.

13:20.975 --> 13:22.509
Her cute little butt.

13:22.511 --> 13:25.512
Hello, sailor.

13:25.514 --> 13:29.182
Just the way our bodies
just fit perfectly together.

13:30.551 --> 13:33.570
Damn, I should've hugged him.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.893
Trust me, buddy,
a stranger in your bed

13:39.895 --> 13:42.229
is not gonna chase away
the memory of Zoey.

13:42.231 --> 13:44.481
What do you
suggest I do?

13:44.483 --> 13:47.818
Well, what usually helps me
is a bottle of supermarket vodka

13:47.820 --> 13:51.521
and masturbating using
my tears as lubricant.

13:51.523 --> 13:55.042
So I'm just supposed to accept
being alone forever?

13:55.044 --> 13:56.827
Hey, you will
never be alone

13:56.829 --> 13:58.695
because I will
never leave you.

13:58.697 --> 13:59.830
Thanks.

13:59.832 --> 14:01.164
Can't get rid of me.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.183
I'm like a dry cough.

14:04.001 --> 14:06.420
Yeah, you might be
onto something.

14:06.422 --> 14:08.805
Maybe I should just
give up women.

14:08.807 --> 14:09.890
We should go gay!

14:09.892 --> 14:12.092
(chuckles) Good one.

14:12.094 --> 14:13.593
But no, I'm serious.

14:13.595 --> 14:15.595
Really?

14:15.597 --> 14:19.182
Okay, okay, if we're gonna
do it, we got to do it right.

14:19.184 --> 14:20.884
We'll get married
in New Hampshire,

14:20.886 --> 14:23.153
uh, register at Pottery Barn,

14:23.155 --> 14:24.554
adopt a Chinese baby.

14:24.556 --> 14:26.523
Ooh, we can wear scarves
at our wedding!

14:26.525 --> 14:28.108
You would look
great in a scarf.

14:28.110 --> 14:30.193
It hides the turkey neck.

14:30.195 --> 14:32.696
We live together,
we like each other,

14:32.698 --> 14:34.030
we're halfway there.

14:34.032 --> 14:35.782
Sure, sure. Mailman already
thinks we're gay.

14:35.784 --> 14:37.751
Yeah, he does.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.619
At night, we could
sit out on the deck

14:39.621 --> 14:41.204
and grill up a
couple steaks.

14:41.206 --> 14:43.373
Steaks? Who are we kidding?
Seared ahi.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.175
Oh, better.
Maybe some couscous?

14:45.177 --> 14:47.094
I love couscous!
Yeah!

14:47.096 --> 14:48.244
Then, after dinner,

14:48.246 --> 14:50.246
we could go inside
and watch the game.

14:50.248 --> 14:51.515
Or if the game's
a blowout,

14:51.517 --> 14:53.183
we switch
to <i>Project Runway.</i>

14:53.185 --> 14:56.603
Yeah! Yeah, what
do you think?

14:56.605 --> 14:58.421
Mr. and Mr.
Walden Schmidt.

14:58.423 --> 15:01.892
So I would take your name?
Why wouldn't we take my name?

15:01.894 --> 15:03.493
'Cause I'm the
breadwinner.

15:03.495 --> 15:06.797
So you think making a home
isn't work?

15:06.799 --> 15:09.366
I am sorry.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.601
We'll hyphenate.

15:11.603 --> 15:13.269
Schmidt-Harper.

15:13.271 --> 15:14.621
Harper-Schmidt.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.406
Fine.

15:16.408 --> 15:17.607
I'll order the towels.

15:17.609 --> 15:23.046
So, listen, um, would we be
having sex like guys do?

15:23.048 --> 15:24.131
I would.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.500
You'd be having sex
more like a woman does.

15:27.985 --> 15:29.052
Hmm.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.287
Problem?

15:30.289 --> 15:33.673
No, I'm open to it.
No pun intended.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.926
But?

15:35.928 --> 15:38.428
Look, I'm willing
to take one for the team;

15:38.430 --> 15:41.297
it's just...
if this doesn't work out,

15:41.299 --> 15:44.401
I'd have to know
I'm gonna be provided for.

15:44.403 --> 15:46.303
What is that
supposed to mean?

15:46.305 --> 15:48.538
It means
I'm not signing a prenup.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.160
Excuse me, is
this seat taken?

15:53.162 --> 15:55.144
No, help yourself.

15:55.146 --> 15:57.030
Thanks.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.368

about giving up women.
