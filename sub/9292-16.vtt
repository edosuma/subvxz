00:14.320 --> 00:16.675
What we're doing here is very simple.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.719
We're going to release a certain substance
so it flows into your pipelines.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.350
Take the canisters
to the main distribution tank, quickly.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.193
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

00:26.280 --> 00:28.430
- No.
- Explain.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.034
We rolled his car,
but he survived and got away.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.511
- It was sloppy. be 11 make it right.
- You better. You know what's at stake.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.511
Get down!

00:46.080 --> 00:49.993
It's the truth. Audrey Raines was my contact
at the Department of Defense.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.230
- You met with her face to face?
- Yes.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.154
- Dammit, Audrey! Tell me the truth!
- I am telling you the truth!

00:56.240 --> 01:01.598
You already lied. Tell me what you know, or
I promise this will become very unpleasant.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.638
Bill, we have a connection.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.474
Henderson made calls to College.
That voids her agreement.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.471
You have three seconds to tell me
where the target is, or I will kill you.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.790
Where is the target?!

01:14.880 --> 01:17.474
A natural gas distribution centre.

01:17.560 --> 01:23.192
Once the Sentox hits the main tank and goes
right into the pipes, it's impossible to stop.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.111
From there, it goes to people's homes.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.793
The Sentox is in the system.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.509
- I need C4 and a timer. Get these people out.
- What are you doing?

01:34.600 --> 01:37.239
To deliver the Sentox,
it had to mix with natural gas.

01:37.320 --> 01:42.269
If we can ignite that gas before it leaves
the plant, the Sentox will be incinerated.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.236
Bierko!

01:55.720 --> 01:59.554
- That's it. The main tanks are going. Get out!
- Jack, are you clear?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.238
Jack, respond.

02:16.560 --> 02:19.870
Curtis. Curtis, this is Audrey.
Any sign of Jack?

02:19.960 --> 02:23.191
Nothing.
I've got men searching the main tank area.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.477
Rescue units have arrived.
They're assessing the situation.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.870
Chloe, what are we getting
from the air monitors?

02:29.960 --> 02:32.349
- Come on, Jack.
- Chloe.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.237
Trace readings of the nerve agent,
below danger levels.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.915
It looks like the Sentox was incinerated.
Jack's plan worked.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.472
I'm going to brief the White House.
Apprise me of any developments. Miles.

02:47.080 --> 02:50.117
Curtis,
have be searched the area for Jack?

02:50.200 --> 02:53.317
It's under way.
He hasn't gone out the north exit.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.793
CTU, Jack's OK.
Get a medical team over here now.

03:11.880 --> 03:15.156
Jack! Are you OK?

03:15.240 --> 03:17.071
Give me a hand.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.991
I got him.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.239
Bierko!

03:23.440 --> 03:24.668
Bierko!

03:25.480 --> 03:27.311
Bierko!

03:28.480 --> 03:31.472
- I need him conscious.
- Yes, sir.

03:31.560 --> 03:35.189
- The nerve gas, did it leave the plant?
- There's no trace. It worked.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.238
- Good.
- He's in shock. We need to transport him.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.232
- I want him taken back to CTU Medical.
- Yes, sir.

03:41.320 --> 03:45.029
Curtis, organize an escort team.
You get him back to CTU alive.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.270
You got it.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.749
On my count. Three, two, one.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.389
Team A, meet me by the staging area.
We need an escort to CTU.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.868
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Jack. Is your line still secure?

04:00.960 --> 04:04.032
- Yes.
- What's your status on Henderson?

04:04.120 --> 04:07.669
- He's still an active protocol.
- You need to make him a priority.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.672
Bill, listen to me. I know Henderson.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.275
He couldn't have planned this.
He's a soldier and a patriot.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.476
However misguided,
he believes what he's doing is right.

04:17.560 --> 04:21.632
He was willing to let his wife die
in order to protect someone very powerful.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.280
- Who?
- I don't know.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.313
I think this is bigger than anything
we could ever have imagined.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.154
Karen, you're not hearing me.
They managed to prevent an attack.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.597
It doesn't negate the fact CTU'S performance
has been one misstep after another.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.990
I'm not disputing that,
Mr Vice President.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.868
Then why hesitate to carry out your mandate?
Have Homeland absorb CTU.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.032
CTU is still actively looking
for Christopher Henderson.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.315
A shake-up right now could hamper that.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.631
I won't hold up this takeover
because of a procedural mop-up.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.156
- Henderson will be caught. Understood?
- Clearly.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.676
Whatever hoops you have to jump through,
just get it done.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.672
- Yes, sir.
- Keep me informed.

05:05.760 --> 05:10.231
- I guess we should get started.
- Buchanan is not donna take this lying down.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.630
Despite what the vice president said,
CTU saved a lot of lives.

05:13.720 --> 05:19.078
If Buchanan mounts a challenge, it will be
seen in that light. This could be reversed.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.110
If we were to find someone who would go
on record citing Buchanan's mismanagement,

05:25.200 --> 05:30.149
how he superseded Lynn McGill's authority,
how he allowed CTU to be compromised,

05:30.240 --> 05:33.357
it'd go a long way
to mitigating his successes.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.718
- It'd give us the protection we need.
- Buchanan's people are extremely loyal.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.076
I'm not thinking about a member of CTU.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.831
I'm thinking of Audrey Raines. She was here
all morning. She saw what went on.

05:46.920 --> 05:50.071
And her loyalty is split
between CTU and DOD.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.276
We could take advantage of that.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.069
Let me draft a statement and present it to her.

05:56.640 --> 06:01.191
We're being rolled up, Audrey.
Homeland's taking over.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.840
That's impossible.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.309
Karen told me herself.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.271
No, they can't do that.
Not after what you've accomplished today.

06:12.360 --> 06:15.352
I'd like to think we've earned a reprieve,
but I doubt it.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.477
CTU is in the middle of an investigation.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.596
Henderson is still at large.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.399
I know, it doesn't make any sense.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.868
Karen's taking orders from the vice president.
He wants this to happen.

06:28.960 --> 06:33.033
- Why?
- I've been asking myself the same question.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.994
- We lost him.
- How did you lose him?

06:41.080 --> 06:43.435
Palmer knocked Cobb out
and took his weapon.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.478
We tried to pursue,
but someone came to Palmer's aid.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.120
- Who?
- That's unclear.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.156
They got away.

06:51.240 --> 06:55.119
All right. We're going to our fall-back.
Scrub the scene and get over here.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.156
Yes, sir.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.715
You're all right, Mr Palmer.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.758
- Just take it slow.
- Aaron.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.516
We're at the presidential retreat.
Can you try to sit up?

07:31.360 --> 07:36.195
- I think we need to get you looked at, sir.
- There isn't enough time for that. I'm all right.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.552
Then maybe you can explain to me
what's going on.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.677
Why were those men trying to kill you?

07:43.720 --> 07:46.439
Because David had a source
inside the White House.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.273
Someone was trying
to prevent me from seeing her.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.555
Who's this source?

07:51.640 --> 07:54.200
Mrs Logan's assistant.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.999
- Evelyn Martin?
- Yeah.

07:57.080 --> 08:02.234
She and David were trading emmies. I need
to find out the content of those messages.

08:02.320 --> 08:07.678
I think David was killed
because of information Evelyn gave him.

08:13.240 --> 08:17.472
I drafted a letter to the families
of the victims of the Sunrise Hills Mall.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.869
- It's here for your review.
- Thank you.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.111
Your schedule's there.
You have a gam with the press office

08:23.200 --> 08:25.714
and the president
wants you in on his briefing.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.349
Evelyn, are you all right?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.355
It's been a long day.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.398
I'm surprised any of us got through it.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.996
Oh, do you have your credentials with you?
There's still a curfew in place.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.071
I have them with me.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.276
Good. Try to get some rest.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.749
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.951
Evelyn.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.594
- I really need to talk to you.
- I'm sorry, Mr Palmer. I need to go home.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.274
Madam, please.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.550
This won't take but a second.

09:28.760 --> 09:31.149
You were sending emails to my brother.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.319
- why?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

09:34.400 --> 09:40.396
I traced the IP account right to your address,
so, yes, you do know what I'm talking about.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.634
I need to know what you told David.

09:45.320 --> 09:49.279
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Evelyn.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.590
I have the record of your correspondence.

09:51.680 --> 09:55.832
David deleted the content of the messages,
but I know, Evelyn.

09:55.920 --> 10:01.392
I know you were in contact with him,
so please don't lie to me again.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.354
Tell me what I need to know.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.637
Someone killed David. They killed him.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.915
And then just tried to kill me.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.594
Now, I think they knew
I was coming here to see you,

10:14.680 --> 10:16.955
so I think that means we're both in danger.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.635
- Please, I have to go now.
- Give me what I need! Talk to me!

10:23.800 --> 10:26.473
They kidnapped my little girl.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.839
They kidnapped my little girl.

10:30.920 --> 10:33.309
They kidnapped my baby.

10:35.560 --> 10:40.270
They said they would give Amy back to me
if I gave them the evidence.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.430
What evidence?

10:43.680 --> 10:48.435
I have proof about who's behind
everything that's happened today.

10:49.880 --> 10:52.713
They're donna kill my baby.
They're donna kill...

10:52.800 --> 10:55.872
Listen to me. Listen.
Even if you turn over this evidence,

10:55.960 --> 11:01.398
they're not just donna give you back your
daughter. That's not what these people do.

11:01.480 --> 11:05.029
Now, you've gotta trust me, Evelyn.
Please, talk to me.

11:06.760 --> 11:08.751
Madam, if I may.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.999
Mr Palmer's right. You know too much.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.674
They'll kill you both.

11:24.320 --> 11:30.077
I'll give you the evidence that I have
if you get me back my daughter.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.988
I got Henderson's work records
for the past ten years. There's a lot.

11:47.080 --> 11:52.837
I'll start data mining, see if there's anything
we can use to track him down.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.996
That's Chloe O'Brian.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.799
That's Jim Hill from Homeland.

12:02.880 --> 12:06.589
I'm Jim Hill, Homeland Security.
Could you show me your station?

12:06.680 --> 12:08.750
- Chloe O'Brian?
- Yeah?

12:08.840 --> 12:11.798
I'm taking over your station.
I need your access codes.

12:11.880 --> 12:17.238
- Who are you? What's going on here?
- May I have your attention, please?

12:17.320 --> 12:20.357
These men and women
are from Homeland Security.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.479
I've just authorized
a unitwide backslash protocol.

12:24.560 --> 12:29.190
CTU is being absorbed
by the Department of Homeland Security.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.072
Ladies and gentlemen,
I realise this is sudden,

12:33.160 --> 12:36.038
and this has been a very difficult day,

12:36.120 --> 12:39.749
but let's cooperate
to make this transition as smooth as possible.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.956
There is still work to be done.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.235
Vladimir Bierko is en route to CTU,

12:44.320 --> 12:47.551
and Christopher Henderson
remains an open protocol.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.631
Thank you.

12:54.120 --> 12:58.079
Ms Raines, would you mind joining me
in the situation room?

12:58.160 --> 13:01.038
- Why?
- We need to speak in private.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.072
Fine.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.278
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Wayne Palmer.

13:16.720 --> 13:19.439
Are you all right?
I just heard about the explosion.

13:19.520 --> 13:25.470
I'm fine, but I wish the people responsible for
your brother's assassination were in custody.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.870
- Yeah, well, maybe I can help you with that.
- How?

13:28.960 --> 13:33.272
I'm at President Logan's retreat.
I'm with Evelyn Martin, Mrs Logan's assistant.

13:33.360 --> 13:39.230
- What does she have to do with this?
- She has proof other people were involved.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.311
- Who?
- She won't tell me.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.914
Why not?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.797
Her daughter's been kidnapped.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.238
They'll kill her
unless Evelyn hands over the evidence.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.551
- This has to be Henderson.
- They'll call with a place to meet.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.633
I hanna be on that call when it comes.
CTU will provide operational support.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.439
We're donna need a place to meet.

13:59.520 --> 14:03.433
I passed an old barn about a mile west
of the retreat, off service road 19.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.353
Service road 19.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.237
See you then.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.550
Jack's donna meet us. We should go.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.838
Listen, they may be watching you,
so I don't think we should leave together.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.639
- What do you want to do?
- We'll separate.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.998
- Get to your car. We'll meet in the parking lot.
- OK.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.389
See you soon.

14:31.880 --> 14:35.998
"The acting director's failure
to enhance security, in the light of the threat,

14:36.080 --> 14:40.870
effectively invited the subsequent attack
that resulted in loss of personnel"?

14:40.960 --> 14:43.394
You can't possibly expect me to sign this.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.598
It's a complete distortion, designed
to place blame on Bill Buchanan and CTU.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.959
But you agree that today's attacks represent
a serious failure that needs to be addressed?

14:53.040 --> 14:56.953
Thanks to CTU, hundreds of thousands
of people are alive who would be dead.

14:57.040 --> 15:02.478
But if CTU had been operating effectively,
those people would never have been at risk.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.712
I couldn't more strongly disagree
with this statement.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.360
Well, I'm disappointed with your decision,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.874
but I appreciate your loyalty.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.428
Of course.

15:14.520 --> 15:19.469
Oh, just to confirm,
as on-site liaison for DOD,

15:19.560 --> 15:23.030
you participated
in today's decision-making process.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.677
- What's your point?
- Serious mistakes were made here today

15:26.760 --> 15:30.036
that resulted in the loss of American lives.

15:30.120 --> 15:36.389
It would be a shame to see the taint of CTU'S
mismanagement spread to your agency.

15:37.400 --> 15:40.392
And your career.

15:40.480 --> 15:45.873
By signing this,
you isolate the fallout for today's mistakes

15:45.960 --> 15:49.157
to Bill Buchanan and CTU,

15:49.600 --> 15:51.750
where it belongs.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.595
I'm proud of what we did here today.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.918
The people of CTU are heroes,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.798
especially Bill Buchanan.

16:14.880 --> 16:18.634
This takeover is completely unwarranted,

16:18.720 --> 16:21.280
and I won't help you justify it.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.199
- Hello.
- It's Jack.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.670
- Jack, where are you?
- I'm on my way to see Wayne Palmer.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.795
Wayne Palmer?

16:35.880 --> 16:38.758
Wayne told me
the aide to the first lady has evidence

16:38.840 --> 16:41.957
that proves who's behind
David Palmer's assassination.

16:42.040 --> 16:46.318
She won't give it to Wayne because her
daughter's been kidnapped to keep her quiet.

16:46.400 --> 16:51.190
- They want to trade the evidence for the girl.
- Oh, my God, Jack.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.829
I'm donna need you to retask a satellite
to those coordinates.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.876
- That could be difficult.
- Why?

16:56.960 --> 17:01.670
CTU is being rolled up. Karen is replacing
everyone with people from Homeland.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.069
- What? That doesn't make sense.
- I know.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.277
Even if she has a reason to,
we're tracking down Henderson.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.510
We'll never bring her team up to speed.

17:09.599 --> 17:14.627
I know that she's taking orders
from Vice President Gardner himself.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.314
- Maybe you should talk to Karen directly.
- No.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.799
She's the one in control.

17:18.880 --> 17:23.396
When I was interrogating Henderson,
he was protecting someone very powerful.

17:23.480 --> 17:26.074
He'd have let his wife die
rather than give him up.

17:26.160 --> 17:29.072
And now Vice President Gardner
is shutting down CTU

17:29.160 --> 17:33.756
when we're actually in a position
to bring Henderson in.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.035
Do you really think Gardner's involved?

17:36.120 --> 17:39.749
We can't afford
to take the chance that he's not.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.879
- All right, what do you want me to do?
- Get Chloe to retask the satellite.

17:43.960 --> 17:47.191
Chloe has been let go,
along with the rest of her department.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.511
I need the satellite.
Figure out a way to get Chloe back on.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.239
All right, all right. I'll call you back.

18:00.440 --> 18:04.035
- I could approach senior CTU staff.
- That's a waste of time.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.193
They're worried about their jobs.
We could promise them some security.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.510
Excuse me.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.590
I've reconsidered my position.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.709
I'll sign your statement.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.678
May I ask why the sudden change of heart?

18:22.240 --> 18:24.708
I don't agree with everything in the statement,

18:24.800 --> 18:27.951
but I see the need to shield DOD
of any possible controversy

18:28.040 --> 18:30.873
that could reflect back on my father.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.797
Mllos.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.115
Thank you.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.875
- I want one thing in return.
- What's that?

18:43.960 --> 18:47.873
- That Chloe be kept on and assigned to me.
- Why Chloe?

18:47.960 --> 18:52.317
I'm donna need considerable server access
to compile my report for DOD.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.518
- Chloe can help me finish it in half the time.
- Other people can do that job.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.989
I have a working relationship with Chloe.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.148
She's an asset that you cannot afford to lose.

19:06.760 --> 19:08.876
Do we have a deal?

19:14.640 --> 19:16.790
Yes.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.871
Good.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.872
Evelyn Martin will leave
the presidential retreat in a couple of minutes.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.748
- It's time to get going.
- What about the girl?

19:33.080 --> 19:35.389
I'll take care of her.

19:55.480 --> 19:59.553
- Wayne Palmer.
- I'm at my car. No one's around.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.154
- I'm on my way.
- OK.

20:04.280 --> 20:08.319
I'm extremely uncomfortable
sending the two of you off without protection.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.757
We've been over this. If you leave the
compound again, we risk raising suspicion.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.037
I know it, sir, but I don't like it.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.031
Wayne.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.876
Well, this is a surprise.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.349
We didn't know you were coming.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.830
Are you here to see the president?

20:26.920 --> 20:28.512
No.

20:30.440 --> 20:36.117
Mr Palmer came here to give me a memento
from his brother. It's a service medal.

20:36.200 --> 20:40.671
Sorry, I just knew you and the president
were donna be dealing with this crisis today

20:40.760 --> 20:45.436
and I just... I didn't want you people
to feel obliged to see me.

20:45.520 --> 20:50.640
It would never ever be any obligation on
our part, especially under the circumstances.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.030
I just want you to know how sorry I am.

20:55.160 --> 20:59.836
Your brother was one of the greatest men
to ever occupy the office.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.390
His loss, to all of us,

21:05.080 --> 21:07.150
can't be expressed in words.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.359
Thank you.

21:10.440 --> 21:14.956
I know the president would also like
to express his condolences to you personally.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.589
That means a lot, sir,
but unfortunately I have a plane to catch.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.719
flying David's body back to Washington, so...

21:23.800 --> 21:26.030
Oh, I understand.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.156
Safe trip.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.630
- Thank you, sir.
- I'll walk you out, sir.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.671
Excuse me.

21:46.840 --> 21:48.831
Mr Buchanan.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.198
Ms O'Brian, we're not done here.

21:55.120 --> 21:59.636
- How can they get away with this?
- This is not over. Just follow instructions.

21:59.720 --> 22:03.872
- Everyone's getting fired.
- I'll do everything I can to get that rescinded.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.520
Once what we accomplished today
is made public,

22:06.600 --> 22:09.068
I am confident we'll be back at our posts.

22:09.160 --> 22:13.995
The best thing you can do is stay focused and
follow your orders. Do you understand me?

22:14.080 --> 22:15.991
- Yes, sir.
- It's donna be all right.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.436
O'Brian, don't transfer your station to Valerie.
You got a pass.

22:19.520 --> 22:23.035
- I did?
- Yeah. So get back to work.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.350
I don't understand. Why am I staying?

22:25.440 --> 22:29.479
Because Ms Raines requested
that you keep your position.

22:29.560 --> 22:32.711
What does Audrey Raines
have to do with this?

22:32.800 --> 22:39.319
Ms Raines signed a statement documenting
the numerous missteps made today by CTU...

22:40.680 --> 22:42.591
and by you in particular.

22:42.680 --> 22:46.593
So, for the moment, she gets what she wants,
and she wants O'Brian.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.956
Audrey would never sign anything like that.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.271
Why?

22:56.160 --> 22:57.991
Because it's the truth.

22:58.080 --> 23:02.278
You realise this effectively kills
any chance we have of rescinding that order?

23:02.360 --> 23:05.113
Yes, I know.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.111
Sorry.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.631
O'Brian.

23:19.920 --> 23:24.198
I got a call from a man about an hour ago
who told me that he had my daughter,

23:24.280 --> 23:28.114
and if I ever wanted to see her alive,
I'd have to follow his instructions.

23:28.200 --> 23:32.113
- Did he give you proof he had her?
- I talked to her. She sounded so scared.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.555
Did you tell anybody else about this?

23:34.640 --> 23:38.076
I couldn't.
He said that if I did, he would know.

23:39.040 --> 23:42.919
We have a deal. I'll do everything I can
to get your daughter back, but...

23:43.000 --> 23:48.518
No, I told you before. I can't tell
you anything until I have Amy back.

23:48.600 --> 23:51.239
You called David with this information.
Why him?

23:51.320 --> 23:53.197
I knew him.

23:53.280 --> 23:56.033
He and the first lady were friends.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.839
He was truly a wonderful man.

24:02.880 --> 24:04.677
Yes.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.270
Yes, he was.

24:10.840 --> 24:16.392
I still can't accept talking about him
in the past tense. It just...

24:18.240 --> 24:21.073
I just can't believe he's gone.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.436
I told him this information
because I trusted him.

24:24.520 --> 24:28.638
I never thought for a moment
that it would endanger him.

24:29.640 --> 24:33.394
I have your brother's blood on my hands
and I will never forgive myself.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.232
Evelyn...

24:35.320 --> 24:38.039
you did nothing wrong.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.800
It's them.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.037
Bauer.

24:47.120 --> 24:51.910
- Jack, the call's coming through.
- Patch me in.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.748
Are you ready for this?

25:00.280 --> 25:03.829
- Hello.
- Vfhat took you so long to answer, Evelyn?

25:03.920 --> 25:06.309
I was passing through security. I just left.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.391
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

25:08.480 --> 25:12.996
- Why was Wayne Palmer at the retreat?
- Wayne Palmer?

25:13.080 --> 25:17.870
Please don't waste my time. He was there
for a reason. It wasn't to drop off his resume.

25:17.960 --> 25:22.033
- I think he was there to speak with you.
- I didn't even know he was there.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.793
- I don't believe you.
- I didn't see him.

25:24.880 --> 25:28.031
If you're lying to me,
it is your daughter who will suffer.

25:28.120 --> 25:31.510
I'm telling you the truth.
Please, you have to believe me.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.955
Did you bring what we discussed?

25:34.040 --> 25:35.553
Yes.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.712
Please, let me talk to Amy.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.791
Very well.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.751
All right, sweetheart.
This is your mommy. Say hello.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.070
- Mommy?
- It's me, honey. Are you OK?

25:49.520 --> 25:51.958
Are you coming to get me now?

25:52.040 --> 25:54.679
Mommy's donna be there real soon.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.951
I want you to keep being brave, OK?

25:59.040 --> 26:02.157
- You promise me?
- I promise.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.515
I love you, my baby.

26:04.960 --> 26:09.715
- I love you too.
- OK, that's enough, sweetheart. Very good.

26:10.760 --> 26:16.357
Now take down this address.
4615 Tarpon Street.

26:16.960 --> 26:20.270
- Got it?
- Yes. I've got it.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.993
- Hello.
- Audrey, it's Jack. I just got of the call.

26:27.080 --> 26:30.789
It bas Henderson.
Have you got Chloe back online?

26:30.880 --> 26:34.156
- Audrey?
- Sorry, Jack. Yes, Chloe's still here.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.755
- I'll give you the address for the satellite.
- All right. Go ahead.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.752
4615 Tarpin.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.752
All right. Give me a few minutes.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.355
- Chloe, come with me.
- Don't talk to me.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.078
- It's for Jack.
- Jack?

26:56.160 --> 26:59.391
Chloe, Jack needs your help.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.118
Please.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.592
Fine.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.356
- What's going on?
- I had to keep Karen from replacing you.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.908
That's why I signed. I didn't have a choice.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.629
- I don't understand.
- You're the only one Jack and I trust here.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.154
Jack needs one of the satellites retailed.

27:18.240 --> 27:22.028
- Why?
- Here's the address. We need a full sweep.

27:22.120 --> 27:27.148
- I'm donna need an explanation.
- I will give you one, but we need to hurry.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.029
Something's wrong.

28:27.440 --> 28:28.793
Wayne.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.155
Jack.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.916
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's good to see you.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.560
Good to see you too.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.796
Evelyn, my name is Jack Bauer.

28:44.880 --> 28:47.997
I promise you
we're donna get your daughter back.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.356
But right now I need to know what you know.

28:51.440 --> 28:57.390
I already told them I wouldn't give up
any information until I have my daughter.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.391
Fine.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.119
Excuse me for one second.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.594
- Audrey Raines.
- Let me speak to Chloe.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.399
OK, Jack. Hold on.

29:18.480 --> 29:21.040
- You're on speaker.
- Jack, Audrey told me.

29:21.120 --> 29:25.955
- I can't believe the vice president's involved.
- I know. Where are we with the satellite?

29:26.040 --> 29:29.032
It's coming up now.

29:29.120 --> 29:33.238
I'm sending the image to your PDA.
There are men all over the place.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.834
- How many?
- I'm counting ten.

29:36.840 --> 29:41.994
OK, I want you to keep the satellite on target
and download real-time images to my PDA.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.878
- OK.
- Jack.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.875
I'll go with Evelyn to make the exchange.

29:47.960 --> 29:51.032
Find somewhere safe
and stay there until this is over.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.669
- I'm going with you.
- I can't allow that. This will be dangerous.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.990
- I was a marine, Jack.
- I know that, Wayne.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.230
And you never saw combat.

29:59.320 --> 30:04.838
There is a big difference between training
to kill someone and actually having to do it.

30:04.920 --> 30:11.109
I can't put you in harm's way, out of respect
to your brother. Your family needs you now.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.709
These are the people
who killed my brother, Jack.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.030
They shot a bullet right through his neck,

30:24.120 --> 30:26.156
and then he died in my arms.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.672
Put yourself in my position.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.228
Could you just walk away?

30:36.800 --> 30:38.631
No.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.154
Neither can I.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.038
I'm coming with you, Jack.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.479
Thank you for your support,
Mr Prime Minister.

30:54.400 --> 30:58.518
Give my regards to your lovely wife.
We'll talk soon.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.877
- It'll take me a day to return these calls.
- That's wonderful, Mr President.

31:03.960 --> 31:08.954
World leaders, prominent Americans - they're
all lining up to offer their congratulations.

31:09.040 --> 31:13.556
Sir, were you aware
that Wayne Palmer was on the premises?

31:14.560 --> 31:17.199
- He was?
- Yes, I just spoke with him a half-hour ago.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.475
He just left. You didn't speak with him?

31:19.560 --> 31:21.391
No.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.596
What was he doing here?

31:23.680 --> 31:28.674
He said he had a memento from President
Palmer to give to Aaron Pierce - a medal.

31:28.760 --> 31:32.753
That explains it.
David and Aaron were very close.

31:33.800 --> 31:38.032
I'm just surprised
he didn't want to speak with you.

31:38.120 --> 31:43.353
It's no secret that his brother and I had
our share of disagreements over the years.

31:43.440 --> 31:47.877
It's possible Wayne harbours
ill feelings towards me.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.428
That must be the reason.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.909
- Are you clear on the plan?
- I don't think I can do this.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.355
Do you want to see your little girl again?

32:08.440 --> 32:13.468
These men didn't hesitate to kill Palmer and
won't hesitate to kill you and your daughter.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.710
Right now I am your last chance.

32:16.640 --> 32:20.030
We have to stick to the plan.
Do you understand me?

32:20.120 --> 32:24.193
- Once you have your daughter in your arms...
- I know what to do.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.079
We are going to get her back.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.949
Let's go.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.673
Call out, "Testing, one, two, three."

32:49.760 --> 32:53.116
- Testing, one, two, three.
- Chloe, did you get that?

32:53.200 --> 32:56.078
You're coming through.
I'm refreshing your screen.

32:56.160 --> 32:59.709
OK, we're at the southeast corner entrance.

32:59.800 --> 33:06.319
There's a tunnel through that door that leads
to a conveyor belt to the middle of the plant.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.229
Be careful. There's a hostile at the exit.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.276
Copy that.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.274
Draw your weapon.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.311
Let's go.

33:45.480 --> 33:48.233
Bravo, check,
have you got a visual on the mark?

33:48.320 --> 33:51.596
Negative, sir. All units holding.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.477
Copy.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.991
This way.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.431
Let's go.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.438
There's too many of them.
We're running out of time.

34:39.520 --> 34:44.719
I need you to take out a guard so I can
climb this structure and take out the sniper.

34:44.800 --> 34:48.554
It's about 100 yards north of here
on the other side. Can you do that?

34:48.639 --> 34:51.552
- Yeah. I can do it.
- Wait!

34:51.639 --> 34:54.393
One of them's moving.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.233
Go.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.473
- Mr Palmer, can you hear me?
- copy.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.835
I'm south of the lower belt, moving west.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.150
Continue to the end. Your target's north.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.712
Jack, it's all clear.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.389
This is Bravo.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.755
I think I hear a car.

36:26.840 --> 36:31.709
Vehicle headed north.
Single occupant, female. Over.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.874
Bravo, what have you got?

36:42.920 --> 36:45.798
I repeat, Bravo, what have you got?

36:47.240 --> 36:49.310
Bravo, come in.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.358
Woman is alone in the car

36:53.360 --> 36:55.351
Say again. I didn't get that.

36:55.440 --> 36:58.830
I repeat, woman is alone in the car.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.676
Copy.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.880
We've taken out four men.
Evelyn is in position.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.679
- Wayne, I want you to wait for my signal.
- Copy.

37:24.760 --> 37:28.070
be need Henderson alive.
Do not shoot to kill.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.756
- Yes.
- Open all the doors and the trunk of the car.

37:48.720 --> 37:55.478
Very good, Evelyn. Now go to the front
of the car and drop the keys on the ground.

37:55.920 --> 37:59.879
I have the evidence with me.
I want my daughter.

38:02.320 --> 38:04.993
Bravo, hold your position. I'm coming out.

38:10.880 --> 38:13.678
I have a visual on Henderson and the girl.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.991
OK, Evelyn. Give me the evidence.

38:20.080 --> 38:24.119
I'll give you the evidence
once you give me Amy.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.872
Come on. Let her go.

38:26.920 --> 38:28.911
OK, honey. Go see Mommy.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.230
- Mommy!
- She's moving.

38:33.080 --> 38:36.152
Give me the evidence, Evelyn.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.393
Get down. Get down.

38:39.480 --> 38:42.995
Bravo, check, come in.
Bravo. Come in, Bravo.

38:56.400 --> 38:59.551
Wayne, I didn't get him.
If you've got a shot, take it.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.996
Henderson escaped in Evelyn's car.
Do you have him on satellite?

39:20.080 --> 39:24.392
We saw, but he's leaving the grid. We're
scanning the plant, not the neighbourhood.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.199
Well, then reprogram it. We can't lose him.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.192
- Is she all right?
- Evelyn's been hit.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.513
The bullet passed through.
It hasn't hit an artery.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.955
It's not serious, but it needs to be dressed.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.793
You got your daughter,
now tell me what I need to know.

39:55.880 --> 39:59.111
Who is behind this? Is it the vice president?

39:59.200 --> 40:03.876
- Evelyn, is it the vice president?
- He has nothing to do with this.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.914
You promised me
you would control this.

40:10.000 --> 40:14.437
I didn't count on Jack Bauer showing up, sir.
He outmanoeuvred me.

40:14.520 --> 40:19.116
Sir, Bauer and Palmer won't be around long
enough to tell anybody else what they know.

40:19.200 --> 40:23.273
I'm putting together another team.
I will handle this, sir, I promise you.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.314
I will not let you down.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.229
See that you don't.
