00:50.759 --> 00:53.010
Where's my blue bag?

01:00.185 --> 01:02.186
I don't care. No.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.993
-Pim, do you have him?
-I got him.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.703
He's leaving the house.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.705
He's late today.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.924
-Where are you? Are you right there?
-No, I'm across the street.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.226
-Get closer than that.
-I'm not gonna lose him.

01:42.394 --> 01:45.772
-I'm not gonna lose him.
-Pay attention, guys.

01:50.903 --> 01:55.031
9:01, down Granville Park. Again.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.161
Okay, switch to channel seven.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.965
Sarah !

02:14.301 --> 02:15.551
Hi.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.116
Control the flow of traffic.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.371
Come on ! Come here, Rusty!

02:50.587 --> 02:52.964
Rusty. Rusty, come here.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.508
Come-- Rusty!

02:56.134 --> 02:57.760
Come on, boy.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.054
Come on. We're gonna be late.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.765
Hello, Jack.

03:04.309 --> 03:07.270
-Sarah, could you turn it down, please?
-What?

03:07.437 --> 03:10.439
The music, if that's what it is.
Turn it down.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.525
-Why?
-Has anyone let the dog out yet?

03:12.860 --> 03:16.529
-It's Sarah's turn ! I did it last time!
-It takes, what, two seconds?

03:16.697 --> 03:18.739
Rusty, no! Leave it alone!

03:18.907 --> 03:20.533
Come on !

03:21.743 --> 03:23.327
Andy, stop it.

03:23.495 --> 03:27.832
Andy! Mom, tell Andy to get that thing
out of here. It's screwing up the TV.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.876
Idiot.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.670
Andy, a little help here, okay?

03:32.838 --> 03:34.964
-Moron.
-Idiot moron.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.383
-Moron idiot.
-Nobody's an idiot.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.677
-Except for her.
-Nobody's a moron.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.930
-Except for her.
-Andy, stop it!

03:43.098 --> 03:45.349
I'm trying to watch this.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.560
Those two home together all week?

03:47.728 --> 03:51.355
-There's no school till Monday.
-Oh, boy. What's your day like?

03:51.523 --> 03:55.067
Finish the details on the Morgan house.
They're pouring the footings today.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.071
Then I have to find a guitar teacher
for Sarah, pay some bills...

03:59.239 --> 04:00.615
...and schlepping the kids.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.535
You should get yourself a hobby,
keep yourself busy.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.871
-I already have a hobby.
-Yeah?

04:07.039 --> 04:09.665
And it's taking care of you.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.792
I don't deserve you.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.210
No, you don't.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.213
We owe Arlin and Vee a dinner.
Wanna do it this week?

04:16.380 --> 04:19.550
Well, they're home this week.
I just wanna be with the kids.

04:19.718 --> 04:23.804
-Mom ! Tell Andy to get that thing out!
-Really?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.600
You should have Marci drop
my blue suit off at the cleaners.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.852
Marci's in Manila till the 26th.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.855
Here, sport, give me this for a second.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.068
-Mom ! Excuse me, does anybody care?
-This is what's doing it.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.071
Put this in my office.
I'll show you how we can fix it.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.449
Okay? And, yes, I do care.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.912
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Jack.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.206
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, Andy.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.459
Don't torture your sister.

04:53.627 --> 04:58.547
Sarah, this dog needs to go out.
Don't forget his new collar.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.384
-Sarah.
-Bye, Jack.

05:07.057 --> 05:11.143
--getting a welcome break in the weather
before getting hit by a couple of storms.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.354
That'll make the drive more difficult.

05:13.522 --> 05:16.983
Looks like smooth sailing this morning
heading into downtown Seattle.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.862
We've been seeing slowdowns and
heavy traffic just about everywhere else....

05:46.805 --> 05:49.140
-Morning.
-Morning, Richard.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.810
-Morning, Cindy. How are you?
-Morning, Jack. Great, thanks.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.855
How do I say this, Bobby?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.607
-No.
-Come on, Janet. I don't see why not.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.986
Look, Bobby, here's how this works.
You ask me out, which you did.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.654
I say no, which I did.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.949
You say, "Okay," and ask somebody else.
You don't keep asking me.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.285
At what point does it become
sexual harassment?

06:09.453 --> 06:10.703
Right about now, Bobby.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.788
-Mr. Stanfield.
-Morning, boss.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.000
-Kid's persistent.
-I don't know why.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.836
-The usual reason, I suppose.
-Have you seen Ravi yet?

06:19.004 --> 06:20.796
No, I'm on my way now, though.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.506
Don't forget, merger meeting.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.677
-Nice flowers.
-Born-again Bobby.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.514
-Maybe he's trying to save your soul.
-He'd need bigger blossoms than that.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.569
-Good morning, Betty.
-Morning.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.280
-How we doing?
-Pike Street system's running slow.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.241
I'll tell Carol when she gets in.
We'll get after it.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.578
Merger goes through, we'll go in
and replace the whole thing.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.205
Yeah.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.167
-Morning, sir.
-Good morning, Rick.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.545
Hey, Ravi. What have we got?

07:02.881 --> 07:05.132
Brute-force login.
The interesting thing is...

07:05.300 --> 07:08.010
...he's coming in through Hong Kong,
Korea and Malaysia...

07:08.178 --> 07:11.388
...but he's trying sequential account
numbers. He's hacking all over.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.224
Move over for me.

07:15.310 --> 07:19.063
Let's try a rule change on him,
see what he does.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.733
Put in an IPS signature
that black-holes the pattern.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.404
-See if that slows him down.
-That'd slow me down.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.908
-That'd be resistant to false positives too.
-Yep.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.743
Thanks.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.748
Loss is higher than one would expect,
considering your level of security.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.375
Just write it off?

07:39.543 --> 07:41.585
That depends on how
you view the statistics.

07:41.753 --> 07:45.047
They're not particularly high,
given the fact that...

07:45.215 --> 07:49.593
...we're pushing the business into
some new and uncharted areas.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.221
Online banking is where
the business is heading.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.722
Where we have our branches...

07:53.890 --> 07:57.434
...we'll provide our customers with
more ways to control their money.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.812
As you can see by the chart,
after the merger...

07:59.980 --> 08:02.690
...Accuwest will have 1100 branches
in 13 states...

08:02.858 --> 08:06.277
...with over 100 billion in assets.
So to answer you, Harry, yes...

08:06.444 --> 08:11.407
...we do see a reasonable level of fraud loss
as a cost of doing business.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.368
-How many branches do you have?
-Twenty-seven.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.871
As head of network security, Jack...

08:17.038 --> 08:20.374
...you've never really had to think
in terms of economies of scale.

08:20.542 --> 08:24.670
-But your philosophy of risk is--
-Wait a second, Gary.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.341
Make this clear for me, will you?
What exactly is my philosophy of risk?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.678
-No need to take this personally.
-I take it personally, goddamn it.

08:32.846 --> 08:36.307
I've spent 20 years protecting this bank,
its customers and shareholders...

08:36.474 --> 08:37.975
...from unnecessary risk.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.395
Jack, I don't think you're hearing
what I'm saying.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.190
I hear what you're saying.
Fraud loss is inevitable...

08:44.357 --> 08:47.818
...pass it on to the customers
as the cost of doing business.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.653
We don't wanna do that, do we?

08:51.907 --> 08:54.825
We're all here to serve the customers.
Let's try and get along.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.662
-We can have the best of both worlds.
-Doesn't exist, Arlin.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.000
Look, I'm sorry. This went on
a little longer than I anticipated.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.003
There's stuff I really have to get to.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.508
-Okay, let's get on with it.
-Network attacks...

09:12.427 --> 09:13.677
...network activity.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.516
-Where is this guy?
-He's in reception.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.977
He said it's personal. Should I get him?

09:22.145 --> 09:24.021
No, I'll walk over there.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.819
Mr. Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.865
Jack Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.700
-Do I know you?
-I know you.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.745
-Do you have a card?
-Oh, yeah.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.209
DHD Financial. What can I do for you?

09:45.377 --> 09:47.211
You can give me
the $95,000 you owe me.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.047
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-No?

09:50.215 --> 09:53.008
I'm collecting for GambleNet U.S.A.
Does that ring a bell?

09:53.176 --> 09:56.887
-No, it doesn't.
-You racked up 95 grand in online wagers.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.515
And I got the paperwork to prove it.

09:59.683 --> 10:02.059
You got the wrong Jack Stanfield.
I don't gamble.

10:02.227 --> 10:06.021
-I don't have any debt. Check your facts.
-You're a deadbeat. See you in court.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.899
-Laurie, call security.
-Don't bother, sweetheart.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.362
Gambling's an addiction, Mr. Stanfield.
Get some help.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.883
Well, I thought the idea was
to match it to the curtains.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.678
-Yes, but if you do that....
-Nice flowers.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.179
Bobby?

10:39.347 --> 10:42.016
That would be the wrong thing to do,
don't you think?

10:42.892 --> 10:46.103
-What's up, partner?
-Take a look at this.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.275
Who were you betting on?

10:51.443 --> 10:53.110
I wasn't betting. I don't gamble.

10:53.278 --> 10:56.030
-I don't even know how.
-Well, that's obvious.

10:56.197 --> 10:59.825
You think somebody got my information off
the bank's internal network or what?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.952
Are you doubting yourself
in your old age?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.747
No. More likely a dumpster diver...

11:04.914 --> 11:07.499
-...somebody sifting through your trash.
-Maybe.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.420
A debt collector showed up
this morning about it.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.297
Don't worry. I'll clean it up.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.966
It's just a pain in the ass.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.968
Bill Cox? Guy from Atlanta.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.095
-Supposed to have a drink.
-I can do 5:30.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.014
I wanna get home early, pizza night.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.391
-Good. I'll let him know.
-Okay.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.565
-Hey, you.
-Hi, hon.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.985
Harry and I need to see a guy
for a few minutes after work.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.196
-Okay if I'm late?
-What are you thinking?

11:37.364 --> 11:40.157
I don't know, 45 minutes, tops.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.576
We'll see you when we see you.
Love you.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.953
Love you too. Bye.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.753
I see him. My question is this:

11:52.921 --> 11:56.840
Do we really wanna work
for those Accuwest morons?

11:57.008 --> 12:00.135
-I'll listen to what he has to say.
-This guy could be our future.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.346
Okay, okay.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.556
-Bill.
-Good to see you, Harry.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.351
-Bill Cox, Jack Stanfield.
-How are you?

12:07.519 --> 12:10.187
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Please, sit.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.772
Thank you.

12:19.030 --> 12:23.325
Sarah, the pizza's here.
My wallet's by the door.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.916
Is somebody gonna get that?

12:33.336 --> 12:35.462
-Here you go.
-So listen...

12:35.672 --> 12:38.799
...I don't know how much Harry's told you
about what I do.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.302
Not a lot. Just that you're in banking.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.389
I have a company that provides
banking-support services...

12:45.557 --> 12:48.892
...mainly in the South, but, really,
I'm an old-fashioned entrepreneur.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.941
If that's a scary movie, turn it off.
Your brother won't sleep for a week.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.320
-I'm so sorry to make you--
-Hello.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.742
-Sarah !
-Mom.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.035
Call 911 !

13:07.203 --> 13:10.038
There's over 200 regional banks
in the U.S. alone...

13:10.206 --> 13:14.585
...that have nothing like the sophistication
of the system you developed for Landrock.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.963
Sarah ! Leave her alone!

13:19.257 --> 13:21.425
With your system's software...

13:21.593 --> 13:24.761
...Harry's expertise in law enforcement
and the physical security...

13:24.929 --> 13:26.430
...you're an unbeatable team.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.891
Hey! Come here!

13:29.058 --> 13:30.267
No!

13:30.435 --> 13:33.270
-What are you doing to me? Get away!
-Shut up!

13:33.438 --> 13:35.063
You'd be your own bosses.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.399
I'd just supply the money.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.944
-Don't hurt my children.
-Shut up!

13:41.112 --> 13:43.363
Oh, my God, what do you want?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.949
I have to think about
a couple of other options...

13:46.117 --> 13:48.285
...but this sounds very attractive.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.703
Okay, good.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.624
I hate to break this up.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.459
-I gotta get home.
-Family man.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.462
No! Daddy!

14:00.465 --> 14:02.132
So how many kids do you have?

14:02.300 --> 14:05.594
Two. Boy, 8. Girl, 14.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.555
-Sure you don't need a ride?
-No, thanks, Harry. I'm fine.

14:08.723 --> 14:09.973
Going back tonight?

14:10.141 --> 14:15.812
-No, I've got some business here in town.
-Well, great meeting you. Take care.

14:30.995 --> 14:33.038
She has beautiful eyes, your daughter.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.374
What?

14:36.834 --> 14:39.211
Jesus, what--?

14:39.921 --> 14:41.505
Oh, my God. What do you want?

14:42.006 --> 14:44.550
I wanna get you home. It's pizza night.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.220
Drive.

14:49.347 --> 14:50.556
Drive.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.034
Liam, we're on our way.
Everything all right?

15:11.202 --> 15:15.205
Fine, the house is secure.
And we're setting up now.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.749
I wanna talk to my wife.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.252
You hear that, Liam?
He wants to talk to his wife.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.379
They can't talk right now.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.173
She's busy.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.627
Who are you?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.587
What's this about?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.425
What do you want from me?

16:28.738 --> 16:30.447
This is your exit, Jack.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.901
Three defenders had the chance
to put him on the ground.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.444
They're here.

17:09.612 --> 17:13.156
--as good as he's been down the years.
Tremendous effort to stay alive.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.218
-Where are they?
-Through here.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.018
Jesus.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.354
-What is this?
-Daddy.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.982
Why have you done this, for God's sake?

17:47.859 --> 17:50.068
It's okay. They're children !

17:51.112 --> 17:53.530
I said, "If they were trouble."
Were they trouble?

17:53.698 --> 17:57.075
-They were noisy.
-Yes, we made an executive decision.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.536
But you're a criminal, Willy,
not an executive.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.371
-But I thought you said--
-Shut up.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.040
-Daddy.
-I wanna know what you want...

18:04.208 --> 18:05.500
...and I wanna know now.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.794
Beth...

18:07.962 --> 18:11.214
...I'm sorry about all of this.
I am, but, well....

18:13.134 --> 18:14.718
There we are.

18:15.219 --> 18:18.805
I need you to talk to your husband.
He listens to you.

18:19.724 --> 18:23.226
I need you to make him understand that
if he doesn't do exactly as I ask...

18:23.394 --> 18:26.229
...I will kill you and your two children.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.900
But if you can make him listen, Beth...

18:30.568 --> 18:32.861
...if you can make him do what I want...

18:33.029 --> 18:36.239
...you'll all walk away from
this unpleasantness unscathed.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.033
Not because I'm a nice man...

18:39.202 --> 18:43.079
...simply because there'll be no reason
for me to hurt you.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.793
Make sense?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.423
Can I rely on your cooperation?

18:53.925 --> 18:56.426
-Just tell him yes.
-Yes.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.887
Sarah?

18:59.514 --> 19:01.264
Fine.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.601
And you, big fella?

19:05.019 --> 19:06.770
Maybe.

19:06.938 --> 19:10.106
-Andy.
-No, it's all right. It's honest.

19:12.527 --> 19:15.070
Do you keep a gun in the house, Jack?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.989
No.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.785
-Daddy!
-I'm okay.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.286
-It's okay.
-Don't worry.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.497
-It's okay.
-I'm all right. I'm okay.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.915
Pass me the gun.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.292
It's empty.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.298
You lied to me, Jack.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.969
Don't let it happen again.

19:40.972 --> 19:43.139
You have an excellent alarm system.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.475
What are alarms for, Andy?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.145
-To keep people out.
-That's right.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.773
And they also keep people in.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.943
I'll need the password, Jack.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.988
Lark.

20:00.283 --> 20:03.827
Lark. It's the name of our boat.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.453
All right.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.664
Untie them.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.716
Take it easy.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.718
Daddy.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.553
I'll be fine.

20:22.763 --> 20:26.474
Hi, this is Jack Stanfield,
account number 51216.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.312
I need to change our alarm code
and give you a new password.

20:30.730 --> 20:35.317
I know it's difficult for you,
but try and get some sleep.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.869
Mom, what's going on?

20:46.037 --> 20:49.706
-What do they want?
-I don't know, sweetheart.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.968
Do you want something to eat, Jack?

21:07.058 --> 21:10.101
-I'm not hungry.
-No?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.773
Do you have any wine?

21:18.694 --> 21:20.946
There's some in the bar.

21:23.532 --> 21:27.035
Pim, go and get me a nice bottle of red.

21:27.203 --> 21:30.580
I don't know shit about wine, man.
How do I know if it's nice?

21:30.748 --> 21:33.083
It'll be dusty.

21:35.586 --> 21:38.088
I didn't know he had a gun.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.715
They hit him so hard.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.094
He'll be fine.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.097
It's just a little lump on the head.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.728
-Let's think about something nice, okay?
-Okay.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.064
I know.

21:58.442 --> 22:00.527
We're onboard the Lark.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.697
And the sail's up.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.700
And the sun is shining.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.536
And it's warm.

22:10.121 --> 22:13.415
And, Andy, you're at the wheel
with your dad.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.422
Vel.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.133
Get Jack a blanket.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.803
He's got a busy day tomorrow.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.012
She's asleep. Get some yourself.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.557
-I'll wake you in an hour.
-Okay.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.116
Let's take a look,
show you what's going on.

23:30.284 --> 23:33.369
Yeah, we do have a big storm,
big section of the country.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.497
It's gonna bring a variety of weather....

23:35.664 --> 23:37.499
Morning, Jack.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.169
Time to get ready for work.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.714
You can look for some snow by tomorrow
through the upper Great Lakes.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.553
You have to do whatever they want.
I don't care what it is.

23:50.721 --> 23:54.057
It may not be that easy.
We've seen their faces.

23:54.225 --> 23:57.685
-But he said if we just cooperate--
-I know what they said, Beth.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.608
Did you ever notice
how big squirrels' teeth are?

24:03.776 --> 24:05.401
Where's Andy?

24:05.569 --> 24:07.278
Breakfast.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.407
-Count to three.
-One, two, three.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.910
Andy!

24:14.078 --> 24:15.620
Andy.

24:16.163 --> 24:18.164
This man is not our friend. Stay away.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.500
-But I want a pancake.
-Go see your mom.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.919
-Want some Cheerios?
-No.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.423
You're worried I'll give him
peanut oil, Jack.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.759
I know about his allergy.

24:30.261 --> 24:32.554
Don't imagine for one second...

24:32.721 --> 24:35.932
...that I just blundered in here
out of the rain.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.350
Don't touch him.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.018
Don't talk to him.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.479
And don't feed him anything.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.780
I'm fitting you with
two separate systems.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.782
Audio transmitter.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.618
We hear everything you do.

24:55.786 --> 24:59.122
-What do I do when I get to the office?
-You do your work, Jack.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.624
Chase that American dream.

25:02.710 --> 25:05.128
The video camera,
with a wide-angle lens.

25:06.255 --> 25:08.131
We see what you see.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.008
I've cloned your cell phone.

25:10.176 --> 25:13.678
Any call that you make or receive,
we can monitor.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.974
-What about my family?
-Oh, they'll be safe...

25:18.142 --> 25:19.684
...here with us.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.478
Now, tuck your shirt in and go to work.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.824
-Bye, pal.
-Bye, Dad.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.347
You're a young man.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.809
You don't need to be doing this.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.065
The longer it goes on...

26:07.233 --> 26:08.733
...the deeper in you are.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.362
Let's stop it right now,
before it gets worse.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.953
Same to you, kid.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.058
You're gonna love me.

26:42.226 --> 26:46.688
-Those tickets I couldn't get? I got them.
-I need five minutes.

27:23.517 --> 27:27.937
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
is up 16 points to 10,255...

27:28.105 --> 27:30.606
...on a volume of 22 million shares.

27:30.774 --> 27:33.109
The NASDAQ Composite
is up 11 points...

27:33.277 --> 27:37.196
...to 2,061 on a volume
of 1.6 million shares.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.948
Can you hear me?

28:22.159 --> 28:23.785
Can you hear me?

28:24.870 --> 28:27.997
If you can hear me, tell your boss
I wanna speak to him.

28:28.165 --> 28:32.085
Tell him to quit dicking me around
and tell me what he wants me to do.

28:32.252 --> 28:35.213
-Can you hear me?
-Jack? Are you okay?

28:36.090 --> 28:39.175
Yes, I'm just talking to myself.
What's up?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.260
Arlin wants to see you.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.014
Yeah.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.152
So you're an architect.

28:59.113 --> 29:00.530
Yes.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.699
And you designed this house.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.619
I did.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.623
It's nice.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.710
Thanks.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.462
How old is it?

29:16.630 --> 29:18.047
Seven years.

29:18.215 --> 29:22.385
-How much does a house like this go for?
-This is about robbing the bank, isn't it?

29:22.553 --> 29:25.680
You're using Jack to help you
rob the bank.

29:26.056 --> 29:28.182
Open a few doors
and press a few buttons.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.059
Just look after the kids, Beth.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.980
And, Vel, stick to your work.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.656
I need you to try and get along.

29:43.824 --> 29:47.827
Arlin, I'm tired of him patronizing me.
Gary is an idiot.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.037
Be that as it may, he's a fact of life...

29:50.205 --> 29:53.749
...on top of which, you may be working
for him in a couple of weeks.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.587
Okay. I'll take care of it.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.547
Jack. Are you okay?

29:59.715 --> 30:01.924
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

30:02.092 --> 30:03.759
And Beth and the kids?

30:06.763 --> 30:08.264
They're fine, Arlin.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.685
Listen, Jack, Gary doesn't like you
very much...

30:12.853 --> 30:16.439
...and based on your performance yesterday,
it's not hard to understand.

30:16.607 --> 30:19.859
Also, we had a debt collector here
yesterday asking questions.

30:20.027 --> 30:22.987
-What was that all about?
-Somebody compromised my identity...

30:23.155 --> 30:26.115
...and ran up $95,000 worth
of online gambling debt.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.618
Harry's taking care of it.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.037
You know me, I--

30:31.205 --> 30:34.207
I don't gamble. I don't have any debt.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.625
Talk to Gary now.

30:35.792 --> 30:39.128
-I want this merger to go smoothly.
-I can't today, I'm--

30:39.296 --> 30:41.255
Today, Jack.

30:41.423 --> 30:44.467
Okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.594
Are we on for dinner next week?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.807
Yeah, let me check with Beth.

30:55.229 --> 30:57.480
Looks good. Get it out there.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.362
Gary?

31:04.530 --> 31:06.656
Oh, yeah, Jack. Need something?

31:06.823 --> 31:09.283
Yeah, I just wanted to have a word.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.285
If....

31:11.495 --> 31:14.997
If I seemed like I was a little abrupt...

31:15.165 --> 31:17.833
...or difficult yesterday,
I wanna apologize.

31:18.001 --> 31:21.337
I want you to know I am committed
to this process.

31:22.631 --> 31:27.051
-Just having a bad day, that's all.
-Seem a little stressed. Everything okay?

31:27.219 --> 31:30.429
-Yeah. I'm just fine, Gary. Thank you.
-You sure?

31:32.683 --> 31:34.809
-Yeah.
-We can make this merger work...

31:34.977 --> 31:36.852
...for everyone's benefit.

31:37.020 --> 31:41.065
I'm here to help. If you ever do have
a problem, my door is always open.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.525
Thank you, Gary.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.001
Janet? Come in here
for a second, will you?

32:01.837 --> 32:03.713
We'll do some letters.

32:09.511 --> 32:13.723
Janet, if I've been difficult or distant...

32:13.890 --> 32:16.892
...for the last couple of days,
I hope you'll understand.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.519
-I wanna apologize.
-That's okay.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.062
We're a team, you and me.

32:21.189 --> 32:26.402
And I want you to understand how much
I appreciate what you do for me.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.530
-Thanks, Jack.
-It means the world to me.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.242
Sometimes I think I just need to...

32:36.038 --> 32:37.788
...relax.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.540
Okay.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.042
-Take a minute.
-Okay.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.544
Take five minutes out of the day...

32:43.712 --> 32:48.257
...and just sit quietly and take a break.

32:48.842 --> 32:52.553
-You know, just....
-Sure. Jack--?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.604
He's lost it. Completely lost it.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.814
Letter to Scott Smith.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.360
Dear Scott, pursuant to your request...

33:07.569 --> 33:10.863
...for further information regarding
the security-interface issues...

33:11.031 --> 33:14.492
...unfortunately, the information
that you requested is not available.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.285
Sorry for the inconvenience.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.454
Until the merger--

33:18.622 --> 33:21.499
Shit. Strike that.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.960
-Harry's in L.A. for a convention.
-Thanks for coming to tell me that.

33:25.128 --> 33:28.172
I can refer you to my associate,
Gary Mitchell...

33:28.340 --> 33:31.258
...who may be able to provide you
with the information.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.803
-Regards to the family, usual close.
-Jack?

33:34.513 --> 33:36.555
Jack, I've been looking for you.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.265
Shit.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.227
-There's a Bill Redmond here to see you.
-Shit!

33:41.395 --> 33:44.563
-Who?
-Redmond, from the Federal Banking Board?

33:44.731 --> 33:48.275
-What are you talking about, Federal--?
-Jack Stanfield?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.487
Bill Redmond. Pleased to meet you.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.158
Janet, close the door, please.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.580
-Look--
-Oh, Jack, Jack, Jack.

34:03.333 --> 34:07.294
Liam, take the boy downstairs
and break his knee.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.670
Don't do that.

34:08.839 --> 34:11.005
It's my fault, not his. It's my mistake.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.134
Don't take it out on the boy.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.553
Please.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.013
-Please don't.
-Liam?

34:18.181 --> 34:19.681
Let him go!

34:20.225 --> 34:22.184
Leave him be for now.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.608
I'd like a tour of the bank now, Jack.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.821
I'm sorry, I have a terrible memory.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.697
-What was your name?
-Janet Stone.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.449
-Janet, can I borrow a pen?
-Sure.

34:37.617 --> 34:43.706
That one'll do. I just need to write them
down once, and then they stick.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.041
I didn't know about your meeting.
Who set it up?

34:46.208 --> 34:49.085
It was a last-minute thing, Janet.
I forgot to tell you.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.882
Now, I'm gonna give Mr. Redmond
a tour of the bank.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.679
-Thanks.
-I'll find you if I need you.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.024
-Good morning, Mr. Stanfield.
-Good morning.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.901
-I have a guest, Mr. Redmond.
-Hi.

35:12.068 --> 35:13.444
Hi.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.951
Open sesame.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.840
Mr. Stanfield.

35:36.718 --> 35:41.347
You'd think with so much plastic, there
wouldn't be any need for this real money.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.945
How long do they keep the images
from those cameras?

35:56.112 --> 35:58.113
Fifteen days.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.626
Thank you.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.300
How do you expect
to get in and out of here?

36:18.468 --> 36:20.177
I don't.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.696
This is the real vault, isn't it, Jack?

36:38.864 --> 36:40.573
Binary code.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.408
Virtual money.

36:42.576 --> 36:46.620
Tell me, how can it be stealing
if you can't even touch it?

36:49.249 --> 36:52.877
That's it, huh? This is your plan?

36:53.044 --> 36:57.172
You think your schoolboy techie friend
can hack into these servers?

36:58.049 --> 37:00.801
This is what you kidnapped
my family for?

37:00.969 --> 37:03.679
I don't need to hack into anything.

37:03.847 --> 37:06.181
We're already inside.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.183
All we need to do is plug in.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.229
You're gonna log on to
a maintenance terminal...

37:12.397 --> 37:17.359
...and run a prioritized search selecting the
accounts of your 10,000 richest customers.

37:17.527 --> 37:21.864
And then with the program on this,
you'll withdraw $10,000 from each...

37:22.532 --> 37:26.410
...and transfer the money
to my offshore accounts.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.413
A hundred million dollars.
Wow, that's a lot of money.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.875
-That's a good plan.
-Thanks, we like it.

37:33.043 --> 37:34.376
At least it was last week.

37:34.544 --> 37:39.340
Look around. Do you see any
maintenance terminals to plug into, huh?

37:39.507 --> 37:43.052
The bank that took us over
had them removed.

37:43.219 --> 37:48.223
There's nothing accessible from this room
anymore. Not from this building.

37:50.560 --> 37:54.188
You're in the wrong town.
You should be in Wichita, Kansas, Bill.

37:57.651 --> 38:00.027
You designed the software...

38:01.237 --> 38:03.072
...you find me a way in.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.115
I wouldn't know where to start.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.536
Well, then you have
a big fucking problem.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.919
-Looks like it's almost done.
-Yeah.

38:41.569 --> 38:43.028
Andy!

38:47.325 --> 38:48.575
Let him go.

38:49.703 --> 38:51.453
-Come on--
-Okay, okay.

38:51.621 --> 38:53.914
Answer the goddamn phone.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.168
-Hello.
-It's Tom.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.753
-Hi, Tom.
-Something wrong?

38:59.921 --> 39:03.090
No, everything's okay.
I just dropped a bottle of milk...

39:03.258 --> 39:05.551
...and it's just made
a big mess everywhere.

39:05.719 --> 39:10.347
-Listen, I thought we'd stop by--
-Thanks, but we're all down with the flu.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.100
-All right, well--
-Okay. I gotta get back.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.269
-Thanks, Tom.
-Okay.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.646
-Mom.
-Come on.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.774
Are you all right? Okay, you're okay.

39:20.942 --> 39:23.819
Don't you ever touch my children again,
do you hear me?

39:23.987 --> 39:25.612
Shut your goddamn mouth.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.823
From now on, you do as you're told !

40:00.857 --> 40:02.191
-Roll down the window!
-What?

40:02.358 --> 40:04.610
-How much is he paying you?
-Get back in !

40:04.778 --> 40:08.530
-Five million dollars to get my family out.
-Get in the car or I call Bill.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.538
There are traps in the system.
He's gonna get caught.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.791
You're all gonna get caught, Willy.

40:18.958 --> 40:22.669
-Five million dollars, right now.
-In the car, I mean it!

40:23.129 --> 40:24.421
Get back in the car.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.691
-What the hell happened, man?
-Nothing.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.986
Exactly. So, what's the plan?
How do we get the money?

40:48.154 --> 40:51.156
You are really beginning to bore me.

40:56.788 --> 41:00.082
I want you and your wife
downstairs now.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.434
How was your day, Beth?

41:19.936 --> 41:21.937
Am I supposed to believe you care?

41:22.605 --> 41:25.607
Willy! Come down here!

41:25.775 --> 41:28.944
Jack has broken our agreement
and decided not to cooperate.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.238
Willy!

41:31.406 --> 41:32.614
What's he talking about?

41:32.782 --> 41:35.284
-It's just a game, honey.
-No, it's not a game.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.744
Listen to your wife, Jack.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.831
-Hey.
-Sit down, Willy.

41:43.293 --> 41:45.252
So, Willy...

41:45.420 --> 41:48.672
...what happened today?
How did Jack manage to hand over the pen?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.340
I'm not exactly sure.

41:50.508 --> 41:54.469
-I mean, everything seemed to be fine.
-Willy, I told you to watch him.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.972
Everything was cool.
And then all of a sudden--

41:57.140 --> 41:59.433
Listen, Willy...

41:59.601 --> 42:04.146
...how can I expect Jack to do
as he's told if you don't?

42:04.314 --> 42:05.981
Yeah, I don't know.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.901
-I made a mistake. Sorry.
-We all make mistakes, Willy.

42:09.068 --> 42:12.112
-Just not as many as you.
-Yeah, yeah, I said I was sorry.

42:15.825 --> 42:17.409
All right.

42:19.621 --> 42:20.829
Okay, you're sorry.

42:22.665 --> 42:23.957
Watch them.

42:29.589 --> 42:30.839
God Almighty.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.475
Get out.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.858
Oh, my God.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.654
-What happened?
-Clean this mess up.

42:53.821 --> 42:55.948
Shit! Liam, come here.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.366
-What?
-He shot him.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.952
Go through the basement.
Get the kids out of here.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.371
-Shut up, Vel.
-Don't tell me to shut up.

43:02.538 --> 43:04.957
Pretend to be watching television,
falling asleep.

43:05.124 --> 43:07.668
-Nine o'clock, I'll divert them.
-Sit down now!

43:07.835 --> 43:09.711
Beth, go to the bedroom.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.089
Jack, over there.

43:40.410 --> 43:42.536
Okay, honey.

43:44.038 --> 43:46.456
-Don't really go to sleep, okay?
-Okay.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.418
Just pretend to be asleep.

43:50.336 --> 43:51.920
-Okay.
-Okay.

43:53.423 --> 43:56.174
This is all gonna be over really soon.

44:02.849 --> 44:04.599
What are you planning?

44:06.519 --> 44:08.937
How are you gonna get me my money?

44:14.861 --> 44:16.862
I don't know yet.

44:18.072 --> 44:19.948
I'm working on it.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.909
You've got 12 hours
till the bank opens, Jack.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.952
Shit.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.746
Go. Get Daddy's flashlight.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.171
Okay, go.

45:17.006 --> 45:20.842
-What's going on, Vel?
-It's fine. It's just some local interference.

45:21.511 --> 45:23.220
Go check on Jack.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.692
It's back.

45:46.035 --> 45:47.661
Yeah, he's just sitting there.

45:51.374 --> 45:53.166
Pim !

45:53.793 --> 45:55.335
Vel, you stay here and watch.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.353
Okay, go, honey, go.

46:19.402 --> 46:20.902
Wait, honey.

46:21.737 --> 46:24.448
-Mom.
-Let me go first, honey.

46:25.575 --> 46:30.162
Pim, check the bedroom !
Vel, get these lights on now!

46:30.872 --> 46:33.874
Fast as you can. Fast as you can.
Andy, go.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.046
They're gone!

46:44.051 --> 46:46.094
Liam, we need him.

46:50.475 --> 46:51.725
They're not here!

46:56.314 --> 46:57.772
Hello!

46:57.940 --> 47:00.734
Yes, this is Jack Stanfield.

47:04.197 --> 47:06.781
-You okay?
-Yeah.

47:06.949 --> 47:10.452
I'm sorry. My son opened a door, and....

47:11.162 --> 47:12.412
Yeah, I know.

47:12.580 --> 47:15.081
Come on, honey, help me.
Ready? One, two....

47:18.628 --> 47:19.836
They're in the garage!

47:20.004 --> 47:23.298
Come here. Okay, go, go, honey.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.147
Get out of--!

47:39.315 --> 47:40.899
Mom !

47:46.906 --> 47:48.698
Open the goddamn door now!

47:55.498 --> 47:57.207
Stop!

47:57.959 --> 47:59.334
Mom !

48:00.836 --> 48:03.213
-Andy!
-Get them in !

48:03.381 --> 48:05.549
-Leave them alone.
-Get up!

48:05.716 --> 48:07.175
Mom !

48:12.848 --> 48:14.099
Beth. Beth.

48:14.725 --> 48:17.686
-Jack. Jack!
-All right! Move!

48:17.853 --> 48:19.854
-Okay...
-Move!

48:20.022 --> 48:21.773
...let's do this a different way.

48:59.270 --> 49:01.563
You'll find a way in, Jack.

49:01.731 --> 49:03.189
That's why we chose you.

49:05.776 --> 49:08.486
Hey, you mind if I watch TV?

49:12.825 --> 49:14.951
Where's my mom?

49:16.245 --> 49:18.788
She's upstairs, asleep.

49:19.415 --> 49:21.291
No, she's not.

49:23.169 --> 49:27.172
-Where's my dad?
-He's in his office, working.

49:27.340 --> 49:29.215
Well, can I see him?

49:31.093 --> 49:32.802
No.

49:36.015 --> 49:37.849
I know, I'm sorry.

49:38.017 --> 49:39.809
I made a rule.

49:42.438 --> 49:44.606
I'll let you see him in a bit, okay?

49:46.984 --> 49:49.319
-Okay.
-Good.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.782
Why have I got no sound?

49:54.283 --> 49:55.909
Is it broken?

49:56.661 --> 49:59.204
No. Give it to me.

50:02.208 --> 50:04.292
Fred, why don't you give up.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.419
So you're a genius.

50:07.088 --> 50:08.672
Thank you.

50:26.357 --> 50:31.069
-You want a cookie?
-Have they got nuts?

50:31.404 --> 50:34.864
-Why?
-I'm allergic.

50:35.950 --> 50:38.827
I'm sorry, Andy. I didn't know.
Let me check.

50:43.082 --> 50:44.833
No.

50:45.501 --> 50:47.168
No, no, no.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.879
Not a peanut in sight. You're fine.

50:53.217 --> 50:54.843
I promise.

51:21.996 --> 51:24.038
Jack! Jack!

51:24.206 --> 51:26.875
-Andy? Andy!
-Come on.

51:27.042 --> 51:28.752
Come on, baby.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.837
Breathe for Mommy. Come on, angel.

51:31.005 --> 51:32.922
Andy, breathe for Mommy.

51:33.090 --> 51:35.842
-He's going into shock.
-Is he breathing?

51:36.010 --> 51:39.345
-Is he breathing?
-Barely. He's just barely breathing.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.181
-It's not here.
-Come on, honey.

51:41.348 --> 51:42.724
Get his backpack. Come on.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.063
Stay with me, Andy. Stay with me.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.400
-It's not here.
-Mom, it's not here!

51:52.568 --> 51:54.277
Stay here. Stay here, Andy.

51:54.445 --> 51:59.407
Oh, God. Come on, honey.
Do something, he's dying.

51:59.575 --> 52:01.451
-Breathe for Mommy.
-Andy.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.411
Give it to me, please.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.873
I'll do whatever you want.
Give it to me, please.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.626
Please.

52:11.045 --> 52:12.921
Come on, breathe. Breathe!

52:13.464 --> 52:15.089
-I've got it.
-He's not breathing.

52:15.257 --> 52:16.591
I've got it.

52:17.218 --> 52:19.719
Come on, baby. He's not breathing.

52:25.184 --> 52:27.727
Okay. You're all right, honey.

52:27.895 --> 52:30.772
-You're okay.
-He's okay. He's okay.

52:33.609 --> 52:35.401
Are you all right, big fella?

52:39.406 --> 52:40.865
Good.

53:19.488 --> 53:23.950
I need my daughter's MP3 player
to use as a hard drive.

53:38.257 --> 53:40.008
Honey.

53:40.634 --> 53:43.261
I need to borrow your iPod.

53:44.096 --> 53:45.346
Will I get it back?

53:46.932 --> 53:48.808
Sure. I promise.

53:54.690 --> 53:56.357
Here.

53:56.734 --> 53:59.861
Thanks, sweetie. Go back to sleep.

54:03.699 --> 54:06.200
This is the scanner head
from the fax machine.

54:06.368 --> 54:07.577
Yeah.

54:07.745 --> 54:11.706
And you'll capture the images of
the account numbers off the server screen...

54:11.874 --> 54:13.207
...and transfer them to this.

54:13.375 --> 54:15.668
Ten thousand songs,
10,000 account codes...

54:15.836 --> 54:17.420
...it doesn't know the difference.

54:17.588 --> 54:20.131
-How will you run the actual file?
-I won't.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.926
I'll have the maintenance department
in Wichita do it.

54:23.677 --> 54:26.262
But they're still just images.
What are you gonna do?

54:26.430 --> 54:30.516
Use an OCR program to convert it to data
that the computer can use.

54:30.684 --> 54:35.563
-Then use my merge program from the CD.
-That's right.

54:36.607 --> 54:37.857
What about the money?

54:38.025 --> 54:42.236
Then I just need access to a wire-transfer
terminal, and you'll get your money.

54:43.238 --> 54:44.739
Vel?

54:44.907 --> 54:46.741
It should work.

54:47.534 --> 54:48.743
It better.

55:01.423 --> 55:04.133
-Hello?
-How'd it go?

55:06.011 --> 55:07.720
Fine, considering.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.098
How's it going at your end?

55:10.265 --> 55:12.642
I'll have it finished
by the time you get here.

55:14.019 --> 55:16.813
I guess I never thought we'd pull this off.

55:16.981 --> 55:19.357
I know. What time does your flight get in?
I'll pick you up.

56:00.274 --> 56:01.649
Fire her.

56:02.651 --> 56:04.402
What?

56:05.654 --> 56:08.406
Fire Janet? Why?

56:08.574 --> 56:10.992
I don't like the way she looks at me.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.785
Fire her.

56:14.830 --> 56:16.497
-Anything else?
-I'm good. Thanks.

56:16.665 --> 56:19.667
-You're the only banker who drinks tea.
-I am?

56:19.835 --> 56:21.961
Give us a minute, will you?

56:32.681 --> 56:36.768
Janet, I want you to pack up your stuff
and go home.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.020
What? What do you mean?

56:40.230 --> 56:41.939
Just what I said.

56:42.441 --> 56:44.609
Pack up your stuff and go home.

56:45.569 --> 56:46.819
Why?

56:47.696 --> 56:49.530
You're fired.

56:50.199 --> 56:53.367
-If this is a joke, it's not funny, Jack.
-No, this is not a joke.

56:53.535 --> 56:57.371
I'll call Human Resources. I'll get you a job
with somebody else at the bank.

56:57.539 --> 57:00.666
-Right now, just do what I said.
-What are you talking about?

57:00.834 --> 57:03.211
-Is this because of him?
-Don't argue with me.

57:03.378 --> 57:09.133
-But, Jack, I haven't done anything wrong.
-Pack up your shit and get out of here.

57:09.301 --> 57:10.968
Now.

57:11.220 --> 57:13.513
Screw you, Jack.

57:21.522 --> 57:23.022
When is Daddy coming home?

57:26.902 --> 57:30.154
As soon as he can get them
some money from the bank.

57:30.322 --> 57:32.281
And then they'll leave?

57:32.449 --> 57:34.117
And then they'll leave.

57:37.996 --> 57:42.625
It was a good knife when you first got it.
Maybe six months later, it got dull.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.460
Ever try to cut a tomato with these?

57:44.628 --> 57:47.171
Cox is gonna kill you.
You know that, don't you?

57:47.339 --> 57:49.423
Just like Willy.

57:49.591 --> 57:51.092
Willy made mistakes.

57:51.260 --> 57:53.386
You think he'll reward you
because you're good?

57:53.554 --> 57:55.304
-Shut up.
-Soon as he has the money...

57:55.472 --> 57:58.266
-...you'll be no more use to him.
-Go back into the bedroom.

58:00.310 --> 58:03.146
He has no reason to let any of you live.

58:08.735 --> 58:11.654
What I'm asking for isn't standard,
you know.

58:13.365 --> 58:14.907
They might not do it.

58:15.075 --> 58:16.742
They might say:

58:17.411 --> 58:20.788
"We did it yesterday" or "It's scheduled
for tomorrow" or something.

58:20.956 --> 58:23.249
Get on with it. Make it happen.

58:35.470 --> 58:38.806
-Operations.
-Stacy, Jack Stanfield in Seattle.

58:38.974 --> 58:40.725
Hi, Mr. Stanfield.

58:40.893 --> 58:43.019
I need you to run
a maintenance sort program...

58:43.187 --> 58:45.980
...weigh all online accounts,
largest to smallest.

58:46.148 --> 58:48.191
Give me a sec, I'll check.

58:50.110 --> 58:51.319
Okay, keycard.

58:52.070 --> 58:54.780
Coming up. There you go.

58:55.616 --> 58:57.533
Ready to run.

58:57.701 --> 59:00.661
-I'm telling you, Arlin....
-Go and deal with it.

59:01.622 --> 59:03.039
It's running, Stacy.

59:03.207 --> 59:04.457
Okay, if you need--

59:04.625 --> 59:06.000
Go.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.006
With money moving every nanosecond...

59:12.174 --> 59:14.467
...we have to provide a platform
for technology...

59:14.635 --> 59:17.595
...to be able to maintain and control risk.

59:18.013 --> 59:21.891
-You have to be thinking outside the box.
-Oh, I understand.

59:22.059 --> 59:25.895
These geeks with their laptops can
figure out ways to steal money from you.

59:26.063 --> 59:28.522
-Arlin, you lost?
-Hi, Jack.

59:28.690 --> 59:32.193
No, Gary's trying to teach me something
about the new technology.

59:32.361 --> 59:33.569
-Well, good luck.
-Yeah.

59:33.737 --> 59:36.739
I told him you've been trying that for years.
What are you up to?

59:36.907 --> 59:38.532
Well, there's a--

59:38.700 --> 59:40.910
I came down because there was...

59:41.078 --> 59:43.204
...a maintenance issue
with one of the servers.

59:43.372 --> 59:45.081
Got the engineers coming down.

59:45.249 --> 59:47.875
I asked to be notified
about all maintenance issues.

59:48.043 --> 59:50.836
No one told me a server was down.

59:51.046 --> 59:54.632
They probably didn't realize the procedures
changed. Wichita didn't call you?

59:54.800 --> 59:56.217
No.

59:56.385 --> 59:58.302
Who's "they"?

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.097
I don't know. Janet took the call.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.224
Did you fire her this morning?

01:00:03.392 --> 01:00:05.559
You know, Arlin,
it just wasn't working out.

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.770
Seems kind of sudden.

01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:11.440
Well, actually, it's been....

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:15.528
It's been building for a while.

01:00:15.696 --> 01:00:20.116
Well, care to join us?
Help Gary unlock my analog brain?

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:23.077
I think I'd better get back to the office.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:28.708
I'll check with you later.

01:00:30.002 --> 01:00:32.795
All right, Arlin, you gotta
understand two things:

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:36.424
-Number one, analog is for sissies.
-So I gathered.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:28.309
He didn't wash his hands.

01:01:28.477 --> 01:01:31.437
That's why you should never eat
peanuts off a bar.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.317
Let's go.

01:01:54.086 --> 01:01:56.253
Can I take his collar off?

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:59.673
-No, honey. He needs that.
-Beth, come with me, please.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.010
-Where?
-Just downstairs.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:04.845
Mom.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:07.348
-It's okay. I'll be right back.
-Now, Beth.

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:10.726
Why do you hate us so much?

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:15.022
I don't hate you, Sarah.
I just don't care about you.

01:02:19.027 --> 01:02:21.445
I need you to make a call.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:28.160
Why--? Why would I say this?

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.581
Make him believe you.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.722
Well, hopefully, that's the way....

01:02:57.566 --> 01:02:59.191
Which one is he?

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.569
The kid in the blue shirt.

01:03:07.534 --> 01:03:09.243
Come here.

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:15.499
Mr. Stanfield, sir?
Why did Janet get fired?

01:03:15.667 --> 01:03:18.377
-She didn't do anything.
-We know what you're up to, Bobby.

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:20.254
What I'm up to?
What do you mean?

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:23.674
You and Janet have made repeated
attempts to access secure information.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.134
No, that's ridiculous.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:28.095
She rolled over on you, Bobby.
She gave you up.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:29.763
What are you talking about, sir?

01:03:30.182 --> 01:03:33.100
Sit down. Sit down.

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:12.032
We'll be in touch, Bobby.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.534
Hello?

01:05:16.663 --> 01:05:18.330
It's done.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:20.791
Vel, is the money there?

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.168
Okay, good.

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:26.922
I've done everything you want.
When do I get my family back?

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.175
We have some tidying up to do.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:52.072
Sir, I just wanted to say, regardless
of what you may have heard--

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:59.246
There are hidden cameras
in all the public areas...

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:02.333
...and some of the more sensitive areas
on the secure floors.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.752
So you can see
the whole bank from here?

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:07.046
These are archive files.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:09.131
Ninety-one cameras
running on 20 screens.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.009
Wow, I bet you don't watch much TV
when you get home.

01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:13.927
I don't even have one.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.597
-Sorry. Sorry.
-I got it.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:39.662
Okay.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:44.458
-At least it didn't end up in the keyboard.
-Right.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:50.422
We better get out of here before
we completely screw things up.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.257
-Thanks. Sorry.
-Thank you.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:54.301
All right.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.855
-Where's Jack Stanfield?
-He just left.

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.858
-What was he doing in here?
-Making one hell of a mess.

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:13.028
-What the hell?
-What's wrong?

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:16.657
All the camera files have been deleted.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:32.589
-What is this?
-Just press "send."

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:46.812
Now there's no network,
no account details.

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:50.983
No trace of the 100 million.
Can I have the disk, please?

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:57.197
Vel has a real talent
for being destructive...

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.074
...do you not think?

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.913
See you at the house, Jack.

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:12.755
Jack, what's going on?
What are you up to?

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.591
-I haven't got time for this now.
-You're gonna make time.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:19.886
You'll stay here and explain what you were
doing in areas you're not supposed to be in.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.014
No, I'm not.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:25.559
-Mr. Stanfield, the network--
-Tell him.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:28.520
-What is it?
-The network just crashed.

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:30.606
-The whole floor?
-No, the whole building.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.491
Stanfield !

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:48.582
Jack! Stop right there!

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:50.417
Jack!

01:08:58.218 --> 01:09:00.010
-Get out of the car!
-Are you nuts?

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:01.678
-You're nuts!
-Get away.

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:06.058
Security-camera files are missing,
the computers just crashed...!

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.365
Call the police.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:24.326
Security. We're in the garage,
get the police.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.493
Shit.

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:44.136
Beth?

01:09:47.058 --> 01:09:48.809
Beth !

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:56.817
Beth !

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:01.780
Beth?

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:06.326
Oh, my God.

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.620
Where are they? Where's my family?

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.165
Yeah, we're leaving now.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.042
I'll meet you when I'm done.

01:10:55.752 --> 01:10:57.544
Yeah, will do.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.880
-Cox says goodbye.
-Are they alive?

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:01.840
Just tell me that. Are they alive?

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:04.468
-Come on, man, talk to me.
-We're leaving now, Jack.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:07.012
Why? Just kill me here.
Why should I make it easy?

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.891
You still think there's a chance you might
be able to help them. Now, let's go.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:12.703
Hi, it's Harry. Leave a message.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:17.040
Harry. Jesus, Harry, where are you?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:21.169
I'm in trouble. I'm in real trouble.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.005
I need....

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.589
I need to talk to you.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.633
Call me on my-- No, you can't.

01:12:26.801 --> 01:12:28.468
You can't call me on my cell.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:30.595
They're listening.

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:32.806
Shit.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:57.497
It's really coming down, huh?

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.254
-What a night.
-Well, it is Seattle.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:32.551
Harry. Jesus, Harry, where are you?

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.470
I'm in trouble. I'm in real trouble.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:37.055
I need to talk to you.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:40.392
Call me on my-- No, you can't.
You can't call me on my cell.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:43.937
They're listening. Shit.

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:48.900
This is Dr. Hay's office confirming
your 8 a.m. appointment Monday.

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:51.570
So we'll see you then.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:55.615
Harry, I did it. I finally left him.

01:14:55.783 --> 01:14:58.285
God, I love you so much.

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:03.999
I'm afraid. Get out of there, okay?
Come as soon as you can.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:07.127
I love you.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.296
Harry, it's Eric at Redline.

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:13.717
I found a guy who's selling those
Porsche 356 parts you--

01:15:16.596 --> 01:15:18.305
Yeah, come on in.

01:15:18.472 --> 01:15:20.056
Thank you.

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:23.685
Wow, quite a place.

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:28.315
Yeah. I wanted something sort of
Dean Martin-ish, you know what I mean?

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:30.025
Well, you nailed it.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.693
You know, I had my doubts.

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.153
But after our meeting...

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:36.489
...I could tell Jack was
definitely interested.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.241
And the timing was perfect.

01:15:38.409 --> 01:15:41.703
Without the merger, Jack would
never consider leaving the bank...

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.830
...and starting up on his own.

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:45.957
-How about a beer?
-No, I'm good, thanks.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:50.003
Once Jack gets his teeth into it,
there'll be no stopping him.

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:52.464
Thanks for pulling that proposal
together so fast.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:56.384
-You know, I think I will have that beer.
-You bet.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.529
Harry?

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:18.365
Harry?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.702
Oh, Jesus.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.721
Sure it wasn't the TV, Mrs. Levy?

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:45.767
No, it wasn't the damn TV. I'm telling you,
the guy had a gun in his hand.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.394
Okay, what'd the guy look like?

01:16:47.561 --> 01:16:50.230
He was wearing a gray suit with,
like, a necktie.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.785
Shit.

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:07.914
Taxi.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.917
Hey, taxi ! Taxi !

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:33.606
Let's go inside and play. Get your toy.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:35.567
Janet?

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:38.278
Janet--

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.115
Janet Stone. She--

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:44.326
-Thank you.
-Over there.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.744
Janet.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:49.289
-Janet. Janet, let me in, please.
-What are you doing here?

01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:52.000
-Get out of here, Jack. You're crazy!
-Let me in.

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.294
Get out!

01:17:58.299 --> 01:18:01.468
Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:18:01.635 --> 01:18:03.345
The man who was in my office.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.264
Mr. Redmond. He's a bank robber.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:09.726
He's got Beth and the kids.
He's gonna kill them.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.895
They may be dead already.
I need your help.

01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:16.316
Do you understand me?
I need your help to try and save them.

01:18:17.109 --> 01:18:18.568
Okay.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.654
-I understand.
-Don't scream.

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.331
-Sorry.
-Shouldn't we call the police?

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:36.836
No. No police.

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:38.755
What about Harry?

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:42.675
Harry's dead.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.720
Jesus.

01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:50.934
I was at Harry's apartment when Cox...

01:18:51.102 --> 01:18:53.770
...or Redmond, whatever his name is,
shot him.

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:56.439
People there saw me
with a gun in my hand.

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:59.317
There's a dead man in my house.

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:01.236
By the time I explain to the police...

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:05.657
-...Beth and the kids could be dead.
-God.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.700
I need you to help me find Bobby.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:09.828
-Bobby? Why?
-I need his cell phone.

01:19:09.995 --> 01:19:12.872
I used his phone to photograph
some account code numbers.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.126
I've gotta have it to get the money back.
Can you help me?

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.837
Yeah. I'll find his number.

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:41.526
Why can't you get
a rare burger anymore?

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:43.736
E. coli.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.033
-Everything all right?
-Yeah. Did you talk to Liam?

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:52.912
-No, not yet.
-Where the hell is he, man?

01:19:53.247 --> 01:19:54.956
-Let's go.
-Now?

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:56.916
Yeah, now!

01:19:58.502 --> 01:19:59.794
Shit.

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:02.922
You guys need to go to the washroom?

01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:05.758
Don't say I didn't ask.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:16.269
Jack.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:18.605
-Jesus.
-I found Bobby.

01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:20.899
Oh, great.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:27.405
-It's Cox.
-Are you gonna answer?

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:33.411
I'm not ready to talk to him yet.
I need Bobby's cell phone first.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:36.706
-And I'll need your laptop.
-No problem.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:40.585
-And can we use your car?
-Problem.

01:20:41.504 --> 01:20:43.671
Pop it! Pop it! Pop the clutch !

01:20:45.132 --> 01:20:47.634
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:51.638
Keep the gas up.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.155
I can't believe Harry's dead.

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:12.784
Was he involved with Cox?

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:14.702
No.

01:21:17.456 --> 01:21:20.500
No. Harry thought he was a businessman.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:24.170
But didn't Harry introduce you to Cox?

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:26.172
The whole...

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:29.842
...investment thing was just a scam.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:34.681
Cox was using Harry to get next to me.
Harry didn't know about the robbery.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:37.684
Cox killed him with my gun...

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:42.605
...to make it look as if I shot him
in a jealous rage over Beth.

01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:45.567
Harry and Beth? Give me a break.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:51.656
He planted a message from Beth
on Harry's answering machine.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:56.661
Saying she....

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:02.584
Saying she was leaving me.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:08.214
I also found some encrypted files
on his computer.

01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:12.385
I'm sure they'd tie him and me
together in the robbery.

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:15.054
Cox had it all planned out.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:16.806
Even the gambling debts.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:20.143
We hatch this plan to rob the bank...

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:22.729
...then I find out my buddy is
sleeping with my wife.

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:26.899
After the robbery, I go to his apartment,
I kill him and I....

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:30.903
I disappear with the money forever.

01:22:32.406 --> 01:22:34.866
Forever, as in dead?

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:41.247
I killed the man who was
supposed to kill me.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.559
Be right back.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:27.794
-What are you doing?
-I didn't tell Jack any of that stuff.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:31.673
-Why did he say you did?
-I don't know. I'm sorry about that.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.383
Can I borrow your cell phone?

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.803
Your cell phone, do you have it?
Can I borrow it?

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:39.180
Thanks.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:45.728
-Here.
-Great.

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:47.397
Please let this work.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.411
-Here we go.
-Now what?

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:03.955
I just need to find
a wire-transfer terminal.

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:07.291
Where are you gonna find
a bank open at this hour?

01:24:09.712 --> 01:24:13.548
Welcome to Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:21.431
Jack, you look like a bank robber.

01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:25.810
-Keep the motor running.
-Good luck.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.187
Thank you.

01:24:55.382 --> 01:24:57.383
We'll see you in the morning.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:02.889
I'm sorry, we're closed.

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:13.065
I need to get on your
wire-transfer terminal.

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:14.776
Absolutely. I'm sorry.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:18.154
We usually don't have
a supervisor here this late.

01:25:18.322 --> 01:25:19.906
-You can use this one.
-Thank you.

01:25:21.909 --> 01:25:23.493
The money is put away. I--

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:26.245
It's not about the money.
Sit down. Sit down.

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:29.040
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:35.254
8499116....

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:58.110
Liam, where have you been?

01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.112
Change of plans, asshole.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:04.283
Jack. Where are you?

01:26:04.451 --> 01:26:08.788
At a bank. I just hacked
into your Cayman Island accounts.

01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:10.998
-That's impossible.
-You think so?

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:15.044
I have your account details.
You just lost 20 million.

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:17.129
Bullshit.

01:26:26.557 --> 01:26:27.932
What's going on?

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.350
Check the accounts.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:32.353
-What for?
-Can you check the accounts, please?

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.605
Yeah.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.822
There goes another 20 million.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.408
-Come on.
-I'm going as fast as I can.

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:49.662
We're down 40 million.

01:26:49.872 --> 01:26:53.249
Now you know what it feels like
to lose what you love.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:56.919
-Another account just cleared.
-That was for Harry.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:59.630
Your family are dead. Do you hear me?
They are dead !

01:26:59.798 --> 01:27:01.799
For all I know, they're dead already.

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:04.135
He emptied another one.

01:27:04.303 --> 01:27:06.178
You're down to your last 20 million.

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:14.979
-Talk to your husband.
-Jack?

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:19.817
I love you. Just do whatever you can
to save the children.

01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:23.529
I am, baby. I love you too.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:29.160
Put the money back
or I'll put a bullet through her head.

01:27:29.328 --> 01:27:31.913
You do anything to her or my children...

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.998
...and you don't get a dime.

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.374
It's all gone.

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:38.294
Jack, calm down.
If you calm down, we can talk this--

01:27:38.462 --> 01:27:40.755
You'll get the money
when I get my family.

01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:43.841
Tomorrow morning, when the banks open.
I'll let you know where.

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:46.761
-Yeah, I'll be there.
-Do you hear me?

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.221
-I'll be there. Just--
-Don't bother calling me.

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:52.391
Because I've got nothing to say to you.

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:56.520
-You need to get out of here.
-What?

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:58.564
-I pushed the silent alarm.
-When?

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:02.026
A couple of minutes ago. I'm sorry.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.403
Liam was gonna take care of him.

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:05.988
Put the woman back in the van.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:10.159
-How you gonna give me my money?!
-Put her back in the van !

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.081
Shut up!

01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:21.253
Shit.

01:28:31.098 --> 01:28:32.932
-Move it!
-Just a second. Here he is.

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.601
-Get out of here, now.
-Sorry.

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:38.521
What happened?

01:28:39.064 --> 01:28:40.815
They're alive.

01:28:41.024 --> 01:28:42.274
Thank God.

01:28:42.442 --> 01:28:44.944
I just bet everything on Cox's greed.

01:28:45.112 --> 01:28:46.821
I got the money.

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:49.323
So we still got a chance.

01:28:50.117 --> 01:28:51.450
What are you gonna do?

01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:54.453
I'm gonna meet Cox at the bank
in the morning.

01:28:55.122 --> 01:28:57.415
-How are you gonna get in?
-I can't. You can.

01:28:57.582 --> 01:28:59.625
You fired me, remember?
I don't have a pass.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:07.133
Barking. Jesus, he was barking.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.551
-Jack?
-He was....

01:29:08.719 --> 01:29:10.469
Pull over. Pull over here.

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:21.814
Jack, what are you doing?

01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:25.151
I heard Rusty barking.

01:29:25.318 --> 01:29:28.279
-He's with Beth and the kids in the van.
-So?

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:30.197
He's got this...

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:33.784
...GPS. He's got this GPS thing.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:35.745
You're not making any sense.

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:37.997
He was running away all the time...

01:29:38.165 --> 01:29:40.416
...so we got him a collar
with a GPS locator.

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:43.377
It's from this website.
If he's still got it on....

01:29:47.299 --> 01:29:49.675
Got him. There they are.

01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:54.513
What are they doing?

01:29:54.681 --> 01:29:56.015
Driving out of town.

01:29:56.183 --> 01:29:59.351
Why is he doing that?
Didn't he say he would meet you here?

01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:02.938
-Here. Get in the car.
-What are you doing?

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:05.900
I'm gonna find my dog.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.209
Can you shut the dog up?

01:30:23.376 --> 01:30:24.877
It's okay, Rusty.

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:29.632
You know, you're never
gonna get that money now.

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:35.054
But if you turn around and take us back, my
husband can give you whatever you want.

01:30:35.222 --> 01:30:39.058
-You can split it between the two of you.
-Shut the damn dog up!

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:01.080
Jack.

01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:04.625
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:06.710
-You want me to drive?
-No. No, I'm fine.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.338
Where are they now?

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:11.841
They're still on the 2.

01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:40.953
They just turned off the road.

01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:44.874
There's nothing on this map
except a big lake and some railroad tracks.

01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:47.251
-How far?
-Twenty miles.

01:31:47.419 --> 01:31:50.045
Where the hell are they going?

01:31:53.425 --> 01:31:55.426
Shut up.

01:31:55.969 --> 01:31:58.971
Shut your goddamn dog up.
I swear to God.

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:00.723
It's okay, Rusty.

01:32:00.891 --> 01:32:02.975
-Come here, Rusty. Come here.
-Shut up!

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:07.479
That's it!

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:09.982
I warned you !

01:32:11.443 --> 01:32:13.986
What are you doing? No! Rusty!

01:32:14.237 --> 01:32:16.864
Shut up or you're going next!

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:20.492
-Rusty! Sorry, baby.
-Quiet!

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:22.661
You hear me?

01:32:53.693 --> 01:32:54.902
Put them in the back room.

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:57.696
Maybe we should just forget it.

01:32:57.864 --> 01:32:59.365
Let them all go.

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:03.786
Maybe you should do your job
and put them in the back room.

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.883
Why would he bring them
all the way out here?

01:33:18.885 --> 01:33:23.722
I don't think he was planning
on leaving anyone alive.

01:33:27.018 --> 01:33:28.727
God.

01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:38.445
-Hey.
-Oh, my God. Come here.

01:33:38.613 --> 01:33:39.905
-It's all right.
-Hey.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:42.992
-He can't breathe.
-Sit your ass down. I don't give a rat's ass.

01:33:43.159 --> 01:33:46.578
-I'm sick of you people, man.
-Honey.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:48.789
Vel.

01:33:49.499 --> 01:33:51.750
Please help us.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.887
We need to exchange you...

01:34:04.055 --> 01:34:08.017
...for the money,
and then we'll let you go.

01:34:09.269 --> 01:34:10.728
Okay?

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:14.106
You'll be all right.

01:34:14.274 --> 01:34:15.566
Thank you.

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:26.285
They're slowing down.

01:34:29.122 --> 01:34:30.956
Look.

01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:39.840
Rusty.

01:34:40.467 --> 01:34:41.759
Rusty.

01:34:41.926 --> 01:34:44.803
Come here, Rusty. It's okay.

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:47.973
Where are they, Rusty?

01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:50.392
Where have they gone?

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.728
Where's Andy?

01:34:57.275 --> 01:35:00.194
There's a house down there by the lake.
I see Beth's car.

01:35:00.362 --> 01:35:01.904
-You got a cell phone?
-Yeah.

01:35:02.072 --> 01:35:03.322
Call the police.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:05.949
Shouldn't we just wait here
for the police?

01:35:06.868 --> 01:35:08.494
No.

01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:10.412
I can't. I can't wait.

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.039
Thanks for everything.

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:14.291
You got your job back.

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:58.043
Will he call?

01:35:58.711 --> 01:36:01.004
You think he'll just give us the money,
no police?

01:36:02.048 --> 01:36:05.092
He knows I'll kill his family if he doesn't.

01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:11.348
I just need to up the ante a little.

01:36:16.563 --> 01:36:18.897
No. Please don't.
What are you doing?

01:36:19.065 --> 01:36:20.899
-Let her go!
-No!

01:36:21.067 --> 01:36:22.609
Stop it!

01:36:23.445 --> 01:36:24.736
-My God !
-Oh, my God !

01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:26.280
-Come on.
-Shut up!

01:36:26.448 --> 01:36:28.866
Why are you doing this?

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.367
Pim !

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.127
Come here!

01:36:53.224 --> 01:36:55.976
Where you at, sweetie? Wanna play?

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.437
Marco.

01:36:58.605 --> 01:37:00.272
Polo.

01:37:03.485 --> 01:37:05.360
Marco.

01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:07.988
Polo.

01:37:18.541 --> 01:37:19.958
Hey!

01:37:33.973 --> 01:37:35.641
-Help! We're in here!
-Come on !

01:37:42.232 --> 01:37:43.482
Dad !

01:37:44.359 --> 01:37:46.693
-Dad !
-Run, Sarah. Run and hide!

01:37:47.904 --> 01:37:49.696
-Move it!
-Dad !

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.324
Put him down. Let him go! Oh, my--

01:37:57.121 --> 01:37:59.581
Get upstairs now!

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.006
Come on, get up the stairs!

01:38:08.174 --> 01:38:11.468
-Move it! Move it!
-Let me go!

01:38:13.179 --> 01:38:15.514
Go on, now. Move it! Get up there!

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.735
Daddy!

01:38:30.989 --> 01:38:32.990
Daddy!

01:39:22.582 --> 01:39:24.082
-Jack!
-Run, Beth ! Run !

01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:25.959
Run.

01:40:35.655 --> 01:40:37.155
Beth.

01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:38.699
Beth !

01:40:40.159 --> 01:40:41.451
Jack?

01:40:41.619 --> 01:40:43.620
Beth !

01:40:46.499 --> 01:40:48.208
Jack!
