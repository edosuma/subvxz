10:11.577 --> 10:13.677
Can't we all just
skate along?

10:13.679 --> 10:15.045
I don't hang
with criminals.

10:15.047 --> 10:18.248
I'm out like your mom
in a beauty pageant.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.850
Peace!

10:19.852 --> 10:22.786
Skateboarding is not a crime!

10:22.788 --> 10:26.824
C'mon, Mikey.
Let's hang out at my place.

10:26.826 --> 10:27.891
Aw, man!

10:27.893 --> 10:29.760
(Casey)
Stupid talking lizard!

10:29.762 --> 10:32.830
Mikey's fallen for
your shtick,

10:32.832 --> 10:34.565
but not Casey Jones!

10:34.567 --> 10:37.234
[crash]
Huh?

10:37.236 --> 10:39.903
Who's there?

10:42.040 --> 10:42.973
[gasps]
[screams]

10:42.975 --> 10:45.075
[talking and grunting
as they play]

10:45.077 --> 10:47.811
- Ha ha!
- Come on, glove safe!

10:47.813 --> 10:48.712
[growls]

10:48.714 --> 10:49.346
Slap shot!

10:49.348 --> 10:52.149
[game beeping]
- Watch it, watch it, watch it--

10:52.151 --> 10:53.117
[laughing]

10:53.119 --> 10:54.752
- Raph for the win!
- Oh...

10:54.754 --> 10:57.087
In yo' face!
Who's next?

10:57.089 --> 11:00.224
Who can give me some
real competition?

11:00.226 --> 11:02.226
Casey?

11:02.228 --> 11:03.060
Oh, right.

11:03.062 --> 11:03.861
He's gone.

11:03.863 --> 11:06.363
"What kind of trouble
could they get into?"

11:06.365 --> 11:07.831
They've been gone
all night!

11:07.833 --> 11:09.133
Casey and Mikey
are big boys.

11:09.135 --> 11:12.870
They can take care
of themselves.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.605
Right.
I'm calling.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.639
[dials phone]

11:15.641 --> 11:16.640
[steady beeping]

11:16.642 --> 11:18.008
Casey's signal is lost.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.110
Mikey's not
picking up either.

11:20.112 --> 11:23.347
At least he still has
a signal I can track.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.815
Come on!

11:26.751 --> 11:27.718
Whoa!

11:27.720 --> 11:29.753
You live in the sewers, too?

11:29.755 --> 11:30.387
Of course.

11:30.389 --> 11:33.290
Mr. X has taken a lot
of us mutants in.

11:33.292 --> 11:34.258
Mr. X?

11:34.260 --> 11:35.693
You've never heard of Mr. X?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.262
Great man.
He gave me a home, a job.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.964
Maybe if he likes you, he could
give you a job, too!

11:40.966 --> 11:45.369
I already gots a job.
I'm a ninja, dog!

11:45.371 --> 11:46.737
Oh, ho, ho!

11:46.739 --> 11:49.106
[panting]

11:50.742 --> 11:53.177
Come on, dude.
Just a little further.

11:53.179 --> 11:53.944
Where are we?

11:53.946 --> 11:57.081
I've never seen this
part of the sewer before.

11:57.083 --> 11:58.849
Aah!
What the--

11:58.851 --> 12:01.251
[grunts]

12:01.253 --> 12:05.155
Run, run, run!
Before you get caught, run!

12:05.157 --> 12:07.958
Mikey, I'm sorry.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.226
Excellent job, amigo.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.962
You lured him
right into my trap.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.063
Fishface?

12:13.065 --> 12:14.698
That name is an insult!

12:14.700 --> 12:17.301
I am Xever!

12:17.303 --> 12:21.071
But you can call me
Mr. X.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.073
Mondo, how could you?

12:23.075 --> 12:25.109
I thought
we were pals, dude!

12:25.111 --> 12:28.679
You sure the turtles are
as bad as you say, Mr. X?

12:28.681 --> 12:32.149
Stamp out any sympathy
you might feel for him,

12:32.151 --> 12:34.752
for tonight, he races...

12:34.754 --> 12:35.786
to the death!

12:35.788 --> 12:36.453
[evil laugh]

12:36.455 --> 12:37.921
That wasn't the deal!

12:37.923 --> 12:40.791
I thought it was
just a normal race!

12:40.793 --> 12:41.358
Whoa!

12:41.360 --> 12:42.826
(Michelangelo)
Mondo!

12:42.828 --> 12:45.129
Why are you
doing this, Fishface?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.230
It is simple
economics, really.

12:46.232 --> 12:51.101
Mutants get entertained,
I make money, everyone wins.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.838
Well, not you--you are going
to lose, <i>tartaruga.</i>

12:54.840 --> 12:56.974
- [laughs]
- [grunts]

12:56.976 --> 12:58.876
[groans]

13:01.346 --> 13:02.813
Huh?

13:02.815 --> 13:06.483
(Donatello)
We're close.
Not much--

13:06.485 --> 13:07.451
Uh oh.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.786
That can't be good.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.020
Wait, listen to
the police radio!

13:10.022 --> 13:13.991
(man on radio)
3rd and Sullivan,
members of the Purple Dragons

13:13.993 --> 13:16.860
with the words
"For cops, from Casey"

13:16.862 --> 13:18.295
written on
one of their foreheads.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.430
Well, at least
we know we're close!

13:20.432 --> 13:22.366
Let's go!

13:23.034 --> 13:25.068
I don't want to say
"I told you so" about Mondo...

13:25.070 --> 13:30.274
No, wait, I totally
want to say "I told you so!"

13:30.276 --> 13:32.342
(Mondo)
Psst, guys!

13:32.344 --> 13:32.976
Mondo?

13:32.978 --> 13:35.112
Sorry about all this, dudes.

13:35.114 --> 13:37.781
Fishface is bogus!

13:38.049 --> 13:40.350
Totally getting you
out of here.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.519
[grunting]

13:42.521 --> 13:43.453
Huh?

13:43.455 --> 13:44.888
Aah!

13:44.890 --> 13:47.825
(Fishface)
Ohh, Jason, Jason, Jason.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.828
You were one of my most
promising errand boys.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.764
But helping the enemy escape?

13:53.766 --> 13:54.832
You are dead to me.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.167
In fact, let's
make that official, eh?

13:57.169 --> 14:00.237
You're going
to compete in the race...

14:00.239 --> 14:02.272
[chanting and stomping]
- Right now!

14:02.274 --> 14:04.241
[chanting and stomping]

14:04.243 --> 14:06.343
Double bogus.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.045
Totally.

14:11.416 --> 14:12.950
[crowd murmuring]

14:12.952 --> 14:14.384
(Fishface)
Ladies and gentlemutants!

14:14.386 --> 14:19.289
In tonight's race: four
competitors, one survivor!

14:19.291 --> 14:20.123
No rules!

14:20.125 --> 14:22.559
Whoever crosses
the finish line first wins!

14:22.561 --> 14:29.333
In "Mr. X's X-treme Skate
to the Death Death-a-thon 5000""

14:29.335 --> 14:31.568
Can you dig it?

14:31.570 --> 14:34.137
(Michelangelo)
Dude, you see that audience?

14:34.139 --> 14:37.140
It's like a "Who's Who"
of evil jerkfaces.

14:37.142 --> 14:38.208
[roars]

14:38.210 --> 14:39.543
Meet tonight's racers!

14:39.545 --> 14:41.545
First, we have
Michelangelo,

14:41.547 --> 14:45.215
the dumbest of all
the stupid, pathetic turtles!

14:45.217 --> 14:48.719
Hey, I'm smart!
I'm just the party dude!

14:48.721 --> 14:50.420
[jeering and booing]

14:50.422 --> 14:53.257
(Fishface)
Next, we have Casey Jones,

14:53.259 --> 14:57.427
vigilante
and obligatory human ally.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.463
I am not obli--

14:59.465 --> 15:00.731
oblidary!

15:00.733 --> 15:01.632
[all laughing]

15:01.634 --> 15:04.501
(Fishface)
And Jason, the gecko boy,

15:04.503 --> 15:07.204
a traitor
to mutants everywhere!

15:07.206 --> 15:10.674
- [roaring]
- [gasps]

15:10.676 --> 15:13.977
(Fishface)
And for the first time ever,

15:13.979 --> 15:15.746
I, Xever Montes,

15:15.748 --> 15:18.115
will personally
join the race!

15:18.117 --> 15:23.353
Ha! If I can't out-skate a fish,
I'm retiring my blades.

15:23.355 --> 15:26.356
Wrong, dude!
I've seen Mr. X on skates.

15:26.358 --> 15:30.560
He's way faster than us!
We are hosed, man!

15:30.562 --> 15:32.229
Seriously hosed!

15:32.231 --> 15:33.697
Calm down, Mondo!

15:33.699 --> 15:35.599
We need a plan.
Guys, bring it in.

15:35.601 --> 15:41.038
That's right, amigos!
These robolegs can't be beat!

15:41.040 --> 15:45.542
(buzzing)
Time to zzztart the razzze!

15:49.747 --> 15:52.149
Ready...

15:52.151 --> 15:53.684
You are going down.

15:53.686 --> 15:56.153
Zzzet...

16:00.458 --> 16:02.559
Go!

This isn't so bad, right, guys?

16:15.274 --> 16:16.239
Whoa!

16:16.241 --> 16:18.608
[confused noises]

16:23.247 --> 16:24.715

Rocket skates?

16:24.717 --> 16:32.456
No fair!

16:32.458 --> 16:33.390

16:33.392 --> 16:35.492

Take a seat already!

16:35.494 --> 16:37.294
Idiot!

16:37.296 --> 16:39.196
[retching]
[spits up]

16:39.198 --> 16:42.432
You did not
just do that.

16:44.068 --> 16:47.437
(Mondo)
Here comes more cheating!

16:54.445 --> 16:56.213
(Casey)
Look out!

17:13.332 --> 17:15.365
Who said worst?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.401
[chuckles]

17:24.308 --> 17:26.242
Aw, no!
The aquarium!

17:26.244 --> 17:28.879
How scary
can an aquarium be?

17:28.881 --> 17:31.848

Xever!

19:43.481 --> 19:45.582

20:04.002 --> 20:04.734
You cheaters!

20:04.736 --> 20:08.772
You are hideous examples
of bad sportsmanship!

20:08.774 --> 20:10.340
We didn't cheat!

20:10.342 --> 20:12.042
We looked out for
each other.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.276
You told me,
on the street

20:13.278 --> 20:15.412
it's every mutant
for himself.

20:15.414 --> 20:16.746
Well,
you're wrong, dude!

20:16.748 --> 20:22.552
Friends don't let friends get
kicked off of buildings!

20:50.581 --> 20:52.349
Ooh!

20:52.351 --> 20:53.083
[grunts]

20:53.085 --> 20:54.050
[landing grunts]

20:54.052 --> 20:55.685
Right, Raph.
Doesn't look like

20:55.687 --> 20:58.655
they got into any
trouble at all.

20:58.657 --> 21:01.925
You haven't heard
the last of me, turtles!

21:01.927 --> 21:04.060
[evil laugh]

21:04.062 --> 21:07.430
[repeated crunches and grunts]

21:08.532 --> 21:09.799
[all grumbling]

21:09.801 --> 21:11.901
Should've bet on yellow.

21:11.903 --> 21:16.406
Aw, and who's this lil' guy?
He's so cute!

21:16.408 --> 21:20.343
You ain't so bad yourself,
sweetheart...glah.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.045
Eugh!

21:22.047 --> 21:25.715
Mr. X isn't your
boss anymore, Jason.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.350
You're free.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.819
I'm...free?

21:33.958 --> 21:38.828
Gotta admit, you're a pretty
cool little gecko dude, dude.

21:38.830 --> 21:41.131
Thanks.
You guys are the best!

21:41.133 --> 21:45.368
So, Mikey...can I say
"booyakasha" sometimes?

21:45.370 --> 21:48.772
As long as I can say
"cowabunga" once in a while.

21:48.774 --> 21:50.507
Like right now!

21:50.509 --> 21:54.644
(both)
Cowabunga!

21:55.305 --> 22:01.522
