were battling it out

00:07.674 --> 00:10.969
to prove they're the best.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.888
The artists faced their most
extreme challenge yet.

00:13.972 --> 00:17.100
You must transform
your canvas...

00:17.183 --> 00:17.600
{\an3}Oh, God.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.894

- What the [bleep]?

00:21.354 --> 00:22.605
Oh my gosh.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.940
You want to turn yourself
into an animal?

the same look.

his own thing.

thing I know how to do.

goes home.

which artist on your team

00:50.800 --> 00:52.177
was the weakest.

I would not look at this image
and ever think New Orleans.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.160
But definitely some of
the best outlines

09:38.244 --> 09:39.704
we've seen from you so far.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.291

these crisp, sharp lines.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.796
It definitely has a
postcard vibe.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.840
The composition in this tattoo,
where you have the silhouette

09:50.923 --> 09:54.260
coming into the foreground, and
then the dynamic lettering

09:54.343 --> 09:56.804
going from thick to thin
creates a nice flow.

09:56.887 --> 09:57.972

to this tattoo,

10:02.768 --> 10:03.811
especially the "greetings from."

10:03.894 --> 10:06.689
But you definitely lost it in
the word Colorado.

10:06.772 --> 10:08.858
Doing negative letters
is very tricky.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.527

You have a very simple
composition.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.407
The color blends are
super smooth.

10:16.490 --> 10:19.201
The orange-yellow in the sky,
blue to light blue in the water.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.995
{\an5}(Chris)
The highlight is definitely
the postage mark.

10:21.078 --> 10:25.499

to this being a postcard.

Simple idea, but the way

of the lettering,

10:39.013 --> 10:39.847
cutting the postcard kind of
in half,

10:39.930 --> 10:41.849
and you have the bridge
on one side,

10:41.932 --> 10:43.392
and the Falls on
the other.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.186

Think you did a great job here.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.069
Without the word Arizona, you
still get a very descriptive,

10:53.152 --> 10:53.736
postcard feel.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.904
The composition's very nice.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.614
The cactus in the foreground,
with the iconic images

10:56.697 --> 11:00.743

easy to read.

nicely.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.668
The simple composition I think
stands out very strong.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.463
This is what defines being able
to see a bit of everything.

11:12.546 --> 11:13.923

a little bit more gap

between some of the letters,
especially in the word city.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.228
I have to tell you, man,
I got a problem with the apple.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.021
It looks like a big cherry
or a plum.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.482
The New York City apple symbol
is a very distinct apple shape.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.817
(Chris)
What is this tattoo?

11:32.900 --> 11:34.944
You have bubble letters
and a weird shaped apple.

11:35.027 --> 11:39.115
This is a New York City
postcard, are you kidding me?

His being black and gray really
stood out strong.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.000
(Chris)
There's a beautiful symmetry

11:50.084 --> 11:51.794

that lettering.

background has that

{\an1}Today, you had to
use composition

26:28.461 --> 26:31.339
{\an1}to create
a Trash Polka tattoo.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.758
Let's see how you did.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.803
Matt, start with you.

26:36.886 --> 26:38.388
{\an1}What really makes
your tattoo stand out

26:38.471 --> 26:40.015
was the detail
in both birds.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.850
{\an1}the ability to achieve
different tones,

26:41.933 --> 26:42.517
from the black
to the grays,

26:42.600 --> 26:43.852
and I like the composition.

26:43.935 --> 26:47.105
{\an1}You did something that's really
concentrated on the thigh

26:47.188 --> 26:48.648
in almost a big oval shape,

26:48.732 --> 26:51.192
{\an1}but you still created a lot
of movement through the tattoo,

26:51.276 --> 26:53.069
with the heavy, dark,
image at the bottom,

26:53.153 --> 26:54.904
and then some areas
of black throughout,

26:54.988 --> 26:57.907
so it doesn't just have
a straight block feel.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.704

27:02.787 --> 27:04.372
Composition in the tattoo:

27:04.456 --> 27:06.541
{\an1}everything's cluttered
to the bottom of the design.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.168
But what's got my attention:

27:08.251 --> 27:12.088
your outline in the hourglass
is very imperfect everywhere.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.965
{\an1}Your two balls on the top
of the hourglass

27:14.049 --> 27:15.800
{\an1}stand out immediately
like a sore thumb

27:15.884 --> 27:17.761
{\an1}against all the other red
circles that you have up there.

27:17.844 --> 27:21.056
{\an1}The craftsmanship you have here,
versus your post card,

27:21.139 --> 27:21.639
are night and day.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.397
{\an1}You've been riding high
for a while.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.732
{\an1}How are you feeling
you did here?

27:30.815 --> 27:32.817
{\an3}Matt targeted a few guys,
and I was one of them,

27:32.901 --> 27:33.360
and this was a tough one.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.236
Matt, is that true?

27:35.320 --> 27:36.571
{\an3}I wasn't trying to give him
an easy ride.

27:36.654 --> 27:37.447
Fair enough.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.573
{\an3}My subject matter was
sun, moon,

27:38.656 --> 27:39.574
{\an3}wave, stars
and palm trees.

27:39.657 --> 27:42.577
{\an1}Yeah, he definitely
handed you a tough one.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.412
{\an1}Well, Chris,
my main problem with it

27:44.496 --> 27:46.414
{\an1}is how it's so big,
but it's still hard to read.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.916
{\an1}You did so much black
in the wave,

27:47.999 --> 27:51.795
{\an1}and then so much black in the
sky behind, it's just dark.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.004
She wanted it nighttime.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.297
{\an3}That was something
I could not get her out of.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.256
(Oliver)
From a distance,

27:55.340 --> 27:56.800
she just has a big black spot.

27:56.883 --> 27:59.803
{\an1}It's just a strangely
unappealing tattoo.

28:01.888 --> 28:01.930
{\an1}Tyler.

28:05.308 --> 28:07.477
Looking at the tattoo,
it is very busy,

28:07.560 --> 28:09.813
but at the same time,
when I look at composition,

28:09.896 --> 28:11.981
if it's interesting,
I can overlook mistakes.

28:12.065 --> 28:15.276
But the Empire State Building's
lined pretty strange.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.736
That outline gets
a little crazy.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.570
I had to hold that kid down.

and this one, some of
the line work just gets away.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.452
{\an3}I wasn't trying to
go for clean.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.579
{\an3}I wanted to go for, like,
that messy, punk rock--

28:26.663 --> 28:29.499
In here, always go
for clean.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.460
Man.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.503
{\an1}Craig.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.799
{\an1}The crosshair pattern
with these circles

28:37.882 --> 28:39.175
sits nicely on the body

28:39.259 --> 28:41.344
{\an1}and I just think it's
one of the more creative

28:41.428 --> 28:43.721
{\an1}conceptual ideas
that we've seen today.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.723
{\an3}I wasn't planning
on going home today.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.475
Overall, man, the circles

28:47.559 --> 28:49.310
with the plane coming out
of the circles

28:49.394 --> 28:52.814
gives it a very cool, old,
war and propaganda feel.

28:52.897 --> 28:56.067
It shows a lot of
artistic creativity.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.529
This is a very competitive,
strong way to come out

28:59.612 --> 29:01.698

29:04.159 --> 29:05.160

29:07.036 --> 29:08.413
{\an1}I like the design
of the skull.

29:08.496 --> 29:09.831
{\an1}I like the technique,
the shading in it,

29:09.914 --> 29:13.209
{\an1}but this is definitely
Introduction to Trash Polka 101.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.503
{\an3}I went simple on purpose
because it was on the ribs,

29:15.587 --> 29:17.380
{\an3}and I didn't want to stick
myself with something

29:17.464 --> 29:18.298
{\an3}that I was not going to
be able to finish.

29:18.381 --> 29:21.342
But creativity in this
is pretty low.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.219

a lot of wow factor

29:32.437 --> 29:33.354
The composition in the tattoo

29:33.438 --> 29:34.898
is definitely something
that's throwing me.

29:34.981 --> 29:38.776
The large red line that you have
running down her side,

29:38.860 --> 29:40.528
you're not accenting
the curves of her body.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.696
{\an3}She definitely
wanted part of it

29:41.779 --> 29:43.990
{\an3}to peek on to
the front of her ribs,

29:44.073 --> 29:45.074
- And part of it--
- Yeah, but that--

29:45.158 --> 29:47.577
That stripe
needs to be flipped, 100%.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.786
You actually widened
her figure.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.542

29:54.626 --> 29:57.003
As far as composition goes,

you went out on a limb

really amazing here.

a really strong composition.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.234
It's open and airy
and breathable.

30:19.317 --> 30:23.321
Your red, it's just
a very strong color choice.

30:23.404 --> 30:24.697
You picked something
that was heavy and solid,

30:24.781 --> 30:27.033
and that accents well with
the stark black

30:27.116 --> 30:27.617
that you have around the clock.

her hair that comes off

30:40.672 --> 30:42.465
{\an1}and how that breaks up
with the dots coming off

30:42.549 --> 30:43.424
and the red coming through.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.510
I love where her neck
turns into the dots,

30:45.593 --> 30:47.679
{\an1}but...you jacked
the face.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.268

what your thought process was

30:53.351 --> 30:54.519
of shading that face.

30:54.602 --> 30:57.313
{\an1}It's just a very strange
layout and shape,

30:57.397 --> 30:59.440

you lose it

look at the most.

{\an1}I got a lot of problems
with this tattoo.

31:11.619 --> 31:13.997
{\an1}For starters, it's hard to read
that it's an explosion.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.081
It looks unfinished at the top.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.625
{\an1}The fact that you outlined
those stripes very weird

31:17.709 --> 31:19.335
{\an1}makes them look like
little pieces of broken fence

31:19.419 --> 31:20.878
that are floating there.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.046
I don't think you nailed it
for composition, and I also

31:22.130 --> 31:25.466
{\an1}don't think you nailed it
with technique, either.

Trash Polka before.

to look at what this stuff was

part of your tattoo, though.

but, like,

32:46.130 --> 32:49.467
{\an3}your whole composition
from the beginning was bad.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.053
- Well, my face was smooth.
- That was the only part.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.137
That's the important part.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.722
No, the whole part
of the challenge--

- Is composition!

- So what?

33:00.019 --> 33:01.437
{\an1}That doesn't mean anything--
what I'm saying is that

33:01.521 --> 33:02.939
that's still a composition.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.525

34:06.919 --> 34:08.713

{\an1}It was kind of a rocky road
for most people.

34:10.380 --> 34:11.841
Duffy made some
strange choices here.

The composition is really weak.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.344
This bird is missing
the angle and the depth

34:16.429 --> 34:17.722

that wing's coming out

34:17.804 --> 34:18.848
of the right part of the body.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.641
{\an1}It just looks like
the wing's sticking out.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.603

Big Ceeze did one of
the stranger pieces today.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.022
We have the face here,
which is somewhat redeeming,

34:26.105 --> 34:27.982
and everything else in it
is questionable.

But then, when we get to
Marisa's tattoo--

34:31.027 --> 34:31.985
(Chris)
It's the other way around.

34:32.069 --> 34:33.821
Her face is completely jacked.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.906
She really pointed out

34:34.989 --> 34:37.324
that she has no idea
how to shade a face.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.034
{\an3}She attacked this thing
with black.

34:39.118 --> 34:41.411
{\an3}She dipped in the wrong
cup or something.

up for elimination.

{\an8}- It's gonna be a tough one.
- Yeah.

{\an8}We're here to determine who had
the worst tattoo of the day.

34:51.714 --> 34:54.257
This is my tattoo,

Where all that black is
on the back of the head,

34:56.302 --> 34:59.347
{\an1}there should have been something
in there to give it depth.

34:59.430 --> 35:02.058
It just seems like there's
so much detail in the bomb,

35:02.141 --> 35:02.600
and not in the rest of it.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.977
It looks freehand.

Then he should've freehanded
the whole thing!

35:06.604 --> 35:09.524
The rest of it looks
so flat to me.

35:09.607 --> 35:12.151
This is my tattoo,

35:12.235 --> 35:13.694
The image was just Photoshopped
and traced onto my leg.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.655

I think, from a distance,

35:17.782 --> 35:19.033
I wouldn't know what that was.

35:19.116 --> 35:21.035
The Statue of Liberty
looks like crap.

To me this feels simple.

I feel like, with Trash Polka,
you can't go basic.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.216
I think that this should be
one of the worst,

35:35.299 --> 35:38.511
because he had free rein
to do whatever he wanted,

35:38.594 --> 35:40.054
