WEBVTT

00:11.875 --> 00:13.583
<i>It comes on a full moon...</i>

00:14.416 --> 00:15.416
<i>to feed.</i>

00:17.291 --> 00:18.833
<i>That's what Ma used to say.</i>

00:22.791 --> 00:23.916
When a wolf...

00:26.291 --> 00:27.958
crosses a maiden's grave.

00:31.500 --> 00:34.708
A pregnant girl who died before her time.

00:38.666 --> 00:39.666
That babe...

00:40.666 --> 00:41.833
starts growing...

00:43.458 --> 00:44.916
right in her belly.

00:54.291 --> 00:55.583
When it's big enough...

00:58.541 --> 01:00.750
that babe rips out.

01:06.416 --> 01:08.041
Only it ain't a babe no more.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.541
It's a monster.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.750
A vukodlak.

01:21.041 --> 01:23.541
I swear, Witcher, that's what got me.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.083
I swear I saw it.

01:26.166 --> 01:29.833
-I swear on my ma's grave, I saw it--
-Shh. Shh, shh.

01:31.416 --> 01:33.958
Three thousand orens. Up front.

03:19.375 --> 03:20.583
No!

03:43.375 --> 03:45.791
This...  I definitely know.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.041
<i>-♪ The vampiress bled ♪</i>

03:50.125 --> 03:52.500
<i>♪ As white as a sheet ♪</i>

03:53.416 --> 03:57.625
<i>-♪ And yet her dead heart did beat</i> ♪

03:59.333 --> 04:00.458
<i>♪ Did beat</i> ♪

04:05.208 --> 04:06.208
The kikimora?

04:14.625 --> 04:15.625
Mm.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.166
Hmm.

04:20.791 --> 04:23.250
I don't recall the bard
singing of this one.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.500
Who would dare
try and rob you of your treasure?

04:29.250 --> 04:30.333
A woman?

04:31.625 --> 04:32.625
Princess.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.041
Were you in love?

04:38.416 --> 04:39.416
What's her name?

04:40.791 --> 04:44.208
When you live as long as I do,
all the names start to sound the same.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.166
Were destiny a kinder bitch,
a whore like me

04:50.250 --> 04:52.875
wouldn't have to settle for
her client's telltales.

04:58.291 --> 05:01.708
A friend of yours came through here
last month headed for Temeria.

05:02.375 --> 05:03.250
Friend?

05:04.125 --> 05:05.333
Another witcher.

05:06.291 --> 05:10.416
Mm. Blessed that prick
with my fullest efforts, too,

05:10.500 --> 05:11.750
-and he--
-What's in Temeria?

05:11.833 --> 05:14.333
-Do you not just hear me talking?
-Shouldn't you know

05:14.416 --> 05:16.208
-when someone's pretending?

05:16.291 --> 05:18.041
- It's been three nights.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.291
Pay up or get out!

05:20.375 --> 05:21.375
Temeria?

05:22.958 --> 05:25.750
It's got a pest problem.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.791
A few miners rounded up 3,000 orens
to have it killed.

05:30.458 --> 05:32.625
Your boy took the coin and ran.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.458
- You hear me?

05:39.250 --> 05:41.083
Thank you... for...

05:42.208 --> 05:43.208
everything.

05:43.291 --> 05:45.125
- Witcher!

05:45.208 --> 05:46.333
Hmm.

05:46.416 --> 05:48.500
-What about the room?

06:00.625 --> 06:01.666
Don't judge me.

06:05.458 --> 06:07.500
I'll be back with payment in a few days.

06:08.208 --> 06:09.708
Anything happens to my horse...

06:09.791 --> 06:12.208
You don't scare me.

06:19.666 --> 06:20.916
Point me to Temeria.

06:56.583 --> 07:00.458
Years of attacks by this creature,
and the king does nothing.

07:01.208 --> 07:04.166
We must force his hand.
Lay down our picks...

07:04.791 --> 07:06.458
and refuse to work.

07:06.541 --> 07:07.583
Yeah.

07:07.666 --> 07:11.291
And a half-measure ain't gonna do!
We've got to move on.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.125
Plenty of work south of Sodden.

07:18.458 --> 07:19.458
My son...

07:20.833 --> 07:21.875
rest his soul...

07:23.583 --> 07:24.583
told me...

07:26.208 --> 07:27.333
in Nilfgaard...

07:28.333 --> 07:31.875
the king diddled whores
while his subjects starved.

07:34.666 --> 07:35.916
Then someone came.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.875
The Usurper.

07:38.958 --> 07:44.583
And he rallied the people,
and they took back what was theirs!

07:44.666 --> 07:45.708
Yeah!

07:45.791 --> 07:47.458
I say we follow their lead!

07:49.958 --> 07:51.916
You can't kill the vukodlak...

07:53.541 --> 07:55.166
so you decide to kill your king?

07:57.541 --> 07:58.541
Great plan.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.458
Another fuckin' witcher.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.750
Your kind already swindled us once.

08:03.833 --> 08:07.708
I take payment after the job is done
and for a third of the price.

08:07.791 --> 08:08.791
An apology...

08:09.833 --> 08:10.875
from my guild...

08:11.625 --> 08:12.625
to yours.

08:20.416 --> 08:21.958
And if you can't kill it?

08:23.083 --> 08:24.083
Then I die.

08:36.541 --> 08:37.541
Please.

08:40.583 --> 08:42.833
Everyone remain calm.

08:44.541 --> 08:47.541
Lower your weapons
and return to your homes.

08:47.625 --> 08:50.250
Do so quickly
and without further theatrics...

08:51.083 --> 08:54.791
and you have my word that our king
will not hear of this treason.

08:54.875 --> 08:57.500
Foltest commits treason.

08:58.791 --> 09:02.708
He hides in his winter castle
as we are eaten.

09:02.791 --> 09:03.791
Yeah!

09:09.000 --> 09:10.458
Mikal was a good boy.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.958
Revenge will not ease your pain.

09:31.625 --> 09:32.666
You know nothing...

09:33.708 --> 09:34.750
of my pain.

09:48.541 --> 09:50.041
Does Foltest have a plan?

09:51.458 --> 09:53.500
See this one to our borders.

09:53.583 --> 09:57.041
Temeria's had their fill... of witchers.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.458
Witcher.

10:36.291 --> 10:38.833
You can put down your sword.
I'm not here to hurt you.

10:38.916 --> 10:41.375
Says the witch hiding in the woods.

10:41.458 --> 10:42.916
Sorceress.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Witch.

10:48.833 --> 10:51.625
Triss Merigold.  I serve King Foltest.

10:51.708 --> 10:53.625
So he makes a show
of kicking me out...

10:54.458 --> 10:57.333
then sends his errand girl
to slip me some coin

10:57.416 --> 10:58.666
so I kill his monster.

11:00.625 --> 11:02.666
Not a very original plan for a king.

11:02.750 --> 11:03.875
It's my plan.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.083
My coin.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.750
And I don't want you to kill the beast.

11:09.833 --> 11:11.583
I want you to help me save it.

11:19.416 --> 11:20.416
Six years ago,

11:20.500 --> 11:23.375
stable hands started vanishing
at the castle above the city.

11:23.458 --> 11:26.250
Before long, citizens were disappearing
throughout all Temeria.

11:27.166 --> 11:30.708
Foltest's royal guards soon realized
the creature was coming from the crypt

11:30.791 --> 11:32.750
where the king's sister Adda is buried.

11:32.833 --> 11:37.083
Rumor has it she was having an affair
with a young man in town when she died.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.166
Was she pregnant?

11:39.458 --> 11:43.000
If she were, that would make her child
the sole heir to the throne

11:43.083 --> 11:44.291
as Foltest never married.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.500
The king fled the castle,
ignoring the rising death toll.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.208
After Nilfgaard overthrew their king,

11:50.291 --> 11:52.375
the Brotherhood
couldn't risk it happening again,

11:52.458 --> 11:55.291
so they sent me here three months ago
to cure the creature.

11:55.375 --> 11:57.208
Vukodlaks are freak mutations.

11:57.916 --> 12:00.333
-They can't be cured.
-Good thing it's not a vukodlak.

12:03.583 --> 12:07.208
Two thousand orens if you can tell me
what exactly killed these people.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.458
You didn't want the people to know
that it bested a witcher.

12:41.250 --> 12:43.916
And you let them believe
that he fled with their coin.

13:01.708 --> 13:03.708
You two clearly weren't acquainted.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.583
His heart's missing along with his liver.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.500
Only one creature I know
is that picky an eater.

13:15.750 --> 13:16.958
A striga.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.791
-Strigas are old wives' tales.
-They're very rare.

13:19.875 --> 13:22.041
The only way to make one
is through a curse.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.375
-Someone wanted Adda dead.
-Mm-hmm.

13:26.458 --> 13:30.166
But the curse didn't stop with Adda.
It turned her daughter into a monster.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.291
Her daughter?

13:31.375 --> 13:32.666
Strigas are female.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.375
This striga's a princess.

14:12.541 --> 14:14.375
Uh... can... can...

14:15.416 --> 14:16.750
Uh, can they do something?

14:17.541 --> 14:19.333
Uh, they-- they're just watching.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.666
It was a nice touch with the applause.

15:02.291 --> 15:04.833
So how many more times
do you think we get to do this?

15:04.916 --> 15:05.958
I don't know.

15:07.750 --> 15:11.041
Soon you'll be off to your ruins,
dashing explorer.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.291
Part-time dashing explorer.

15:13.375 --> 15:16.041
Stregebor says
Temeria leans heavily on its mages.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.791
So maybe you'll be too busy for me.

15:17.875 --> 15:21.666
Or maybe you'll be too busy for me
once you get a taste of Aedirn revelry.

15:21.750 --> 15:24.833
King Virfuril is handsome. Allegedly.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.541
If I do a good job...

15:28.625 --> 15:31.125
I can persuade him
to give you access to our ruins.

15:32.791 --> 15:35.541
-Maybe we'll do this forever.
<i>-</i>Yeah.

15:36.791 --> 15:39.250
Well, after the initiation today,
we're in charge.

15:40.041 --> 15:42.541
We get to make the decisions,
be who we want to be.

15:47.916 --> 15:48.916
What's wrong?

15:49.708 --> 15:52.625
Fringilla and the others
see their ideal selves so clearly.

15:53.541 --> 15:56.291
They know exactly what they want
for their enchantments.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.500
Stop worrying so much.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.333
Easy for a Ban Ard boy.

16:01.416 --> 16:04.583
You dolts needn't change a single wrinkle
before heading to court.

16:15.833 --> 16:16.833
What do you want?

16:24.666 --> 16:28.000
Remember that scared girl
who tumbled at your feet in this cave...

16:29.083 --> 16:30.625
totally unaware of her power?

16:36.708 --> 16:39.375
I want to go back home to Aedirn
and never be her again.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.250
-You're bound for Aedirn?
-Yes.

16:51.291 --> 16:56.208
Let me be candid. You are a...
first draft of what nature intended, yes?

16:57.125 --> 17:00.708
Lucky for you, I'm the final artist.

17:13.041 --> 17:17.916
Every girl I enchant
leaves Aretuza a living work of art.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Hmm?

17:20.125 --> 17:21.875
No matter how challenging the clay.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.583
Perfect for Aedirn.

17:48.666 --> 17:51.958
A gray dress assumes importance
without bald ambition.

18:00.500 --> 18:04.333
Ah. Not the final look. More a preview.

18:23.416 --> 18:25.708
There is not a person alive

18:25.791 --> 18:29.000
that does not look into the mirror
and see some deformity.

18:30.708 --> 18:31.958
Except for us.

18:33.791 --> 18:38.416
We remake ourselves on our terms.
The world has no say in it.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.333
Look.

18:43.958 --> 18:46.583
You can free the victim
in the mirror forever.

18:49.708 --> 18:51.125
I don't know where to begin.

18:53.958 --> 18:54.958
Close your eyes.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.541
I said close them.

19:05.791 --> 19:08.333
Imagine the most powerful woman
in the world.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.875
Her hair, the color of her eyes, yes...

19:14.875 --> 19:17.125
but also the strength of her posture.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.291
The poise of her entire being.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Do you see her?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.500
Yes.

19:45.708 --> 19:46.791
Open your eyes.

19:50.625 --> 19:51.666
She is stunning.

20:04.458 --> 20:08.250
Miss Merigold, you were dispatched
to settle a family affair,

20:08.333 --> 20:11.291
not to enlist a mutant mercenary
for a game of sleuthing.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.541
This is no game, Captain.
Tonight is a full moon,

20:14.625 --> 20:17.208
and Geralt has already proved himself
to be invaluable.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.208
We believe we can cure the creature.

20:19.291 --> 20:20.500
You say she's a girl.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.916
Then you will refer to her
as Her Royal Highness.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.416
Segelin, I believe urgency

20:27.500 --> 20:30.000
warrants flexibility in court decorum.

20:31.041 --> 20:35.208
The witcher's theory is nonsense.
Princess Adda was the people's angel.

20:35.291 --> 20:37.750
-Who'd wish to murder her?
-What about her lover?

20:39.291 --> 20:44.125
Seditious rumors. Idle courtesans
trading out boredom for jealousy.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.250
Perhaps if you called off your guards,

20:46.333 --> 20:48.250
if we were able
to search the abandoned castle,

20:48.333 --> 20:50.708
we could find clues as to who cursed her.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.708
Except this witcher
would kill the princess as she sleeps,

20:53.833 --> 20:56.250
-and collect the miners' coin.
-Call her a princess.

20:57.333 --> 20:59.166
Call her a unicorn if you'd like to.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.791
She grew inside Adda,
feeding on her petrified womb.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.750
-Have you no respect?
-Mutating.

21:05.541 --> 21:07.958
Growing for years
till she got so hungry...

21:09.458 --> 21:11.250
she was forced to slither out.

21:12.333 --> 21:16.875
Rotten muscle, bent bones,
two spidery legs,

21:16.958 --> 21:21.166
claws dragging in the dirt.
An overgrown abortion.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.625
Enough.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.458
- Your Highness?
-Leave.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.166
Hey!

21:48.250 --> 21:49.500
-Open the door!

21:50.166 --> 21:53.625
-Open this door! Protect the king!

21:57.875 --> 21:58.875
Witcher!

22:03.416 --> 22:07.875
-Who's the princess' father?
-My men will kill you, Witcher.

22:08.666 --> 22:11.250
Hmm. It's funny.

22:12.458 --> 22:15.916
You learn that your sister was murdered,
and you didn't even flinch.

22:17.916 --> 22:20.416
But the moment
I mention the girl's father...

22:23.291 --> 22:24.708
Why were you never married?

22:31.000 --> 22:32.291
You are speaking to a king.

22:32.375 --> 22:33.750
That is exactly my point.

22:34.708 --> 22:36.583
Why not produce your own heir?

22:36.666 --> 22:39.625
Why not kill the striga
and avoid this revolt?

22:41.083 --> 22:42.333
Why drag this all out?

22:45.208 --> 22:47.208
Between you and me...

22:49.000 --> 22:50.750
who is the striga's father?

23:03.000 --> 23:07.375
I remember hearing stories
about witchers when I was a child.

23:09.666 --> 23:10.875
Is it true what they say?

23:12.750 --> 23:16.333
That the mutations
that grant you your... abilities

23:16.416 --> 23:18.000
also erase your emotions?

23:19.416 --> 23:20.416
Must be.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.500
'Cause only a man devoid of all heart

23:22.583 --> 23:24.791
could accuse a brother
of bedding his murdered sister

23:24.875 --> 23:26.375
while urging him to kill her.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.166
Leave Temeria.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.208
Never return.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.958
Cintra continues their animosity
towards our organization.

23:56.041 --> 23:58.208
Don't tell me
they're employing druids

23:58.291 --> 24:00.250
or worse--fortune tellers.

24:02.333 --> 24:06.125
King Dagorad has banned mages from Cintra,
God knows why.

24:06.208 --> 24:07.958
I've heard rumors he's taken ill.

24:08.041 --> 24:12.250
Now, if the king dies, perhaps his heiress
will be more pliable. Princess...

24:12.333 --> 24:14.541
Calanthe? Good luck with that.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.958
Word is she's even more stubborn
than her father is.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.000
How fares Nilfgaard?

24:19.916 --> 24:24.208
King Fergus is proving to be
an effective and excitable young king.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.375
Horny, she means.

24:25.458 --> 24:28.833
Spending the kingdom's money on women
as his people starve to death.

24:28.916 --> 24:31.125
Fringilla will be in Nilfgaard
by week's end.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.541
She will bring sanity and bread
to the people.

24:33.625 --> 24:36.750
Your girl is-- With all due respect,

24:36.833 --> 24:40.625
your niece is only capable
of doing what she's told.

24:43.291 --> 24:46.500
No ambitious mage wants to be assigned
anywhere south of Sodden.

24:47.291 --> 24:49.333
But Nilfgaard needs correcting.

24:52.875 --> 24:57.041
Perhaps we consider sending someone there
with a bit more... spine.

24:57.125 --> 24:59.291
Stregobor, did you have anyone in mind?

24:59.958 --> 25:02.291
What about your hunchback protégé?

25:02.916 --> 25:05.083
How's her... spine?

25:06.250 --> 25:09.958
We agreed
Yennefer would thrive in Aedirn.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.250
King Virfuril
prefers mages from his kingdom,

25:12.333 --> 25:16.000
-and Yennefer was born in Vengerberg.
<i>-</i>Oh, we'd be spitting in Dagorad's face

25:16.083 --> 25:18.583
if we send Yennefer
to their biggest trade partner.

25:19.458 --> 25:24.666
The only thing Cintra hates
more than mages is... elves.

25:29.708 --> 25:31.333
Yennefer's of elven blood?

25:32.916 --> 25:33.916
Quarter elf.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.750
Watch a Cintran do that math.

25:36.833 --> 25:39.666
Let's not model our wisdom
on prejudice and paranoia.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.541
Prejudiced or not, you can't deny

25:41.625 --> 25:44.375
Cintra has operated
outside our influence far too long.

25:44.458 --> 25:48.833
Unchecked kings and queens
lead to rebellions. Massacres.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.375
It's the reason this chapter was formed.

25:51.458 --> 25:53.166
Still afraid of Falka, are you?

25:55.041 --> 25:57.958
And you, you spare your niece her duties?

25:58.041 --> 26:01.291
Not enough fragrance in Toussaint
to take the stench off that nepotism.

26:09.125 --> 26:13.916
Let the Chapter vote, then.
I'll even recuse myself.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.250
All in favor of Yennefer to Nilfgaard
instead of Fringilla?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.333
Your Excellence, it's an honor.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.791
-The honor is mine.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.541
King Fergus chose this.

26:38.500 --> 26:41.125
-Not me.
-King Fergus of Nilfgaard?

26:42.375 --> 26:44.208
-What are you talking about?

26:45.916 --> 26:46.916
Uh...

26:51.333 --> 26:53.083
I demand an audience with the Chapter.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.041
I handle court assignments, Yennefer.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.708
-Not the Chapter.
-You promised me Aedirn.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.375
New items came to light
which led me to believe

27:04.458 --> 27:06.416
that you would be a better fit
for Nilfgaard.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.000
There's no power in puppeting fools,

27:09.083 --> 27:12.250
especially one who'd sooner
fondle his sorceress than listen to her!

27:13.666 --> 27:15.666
I don't think new items came to light.

27:17.041 --> 27:18.541
I think the Chapter overruled you.

27:19.791 --> 27:22.416
Is that it? Yeah?

27:22.500 --> 27:24.833
The all-powerful sorceress
Tissaia de Vriess

27:24.916 --> 27:26.625
knocked down from her glass pedestal.

27:29.625 --> 27:30.625
'Twas your blood.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.375
Efforts in Cintra prevent the Brotherhood

27:36.458 --> 27:39.208
from placing a mage with elven blood
in Aedirn's court.

27:43.583 --> 27:45.083
How could you tell them?

27:47.791 --> 27:48.791
I did not.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.291
Stregobor did.

27:53.125 --> 27:54.125
Divine the rest.

28:26.541 --> 28:28.208
How many more hours?

28:28.291 --> 28:29.291
Too many.

28:31.708 --> 28:33.875
You were told to leave Temeria.

28:33.958 --> 28:34.958
But come on.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.083
These views.

28:38.916 --> 28:40.291
Are you going to kill her?

28:44.583 --> 28:46.333
I don't want the miners' coin.

28:46.416 --> 28:47.458
Or mine, apparently.

28:48.791 --> 28:50.083
What is this girl to you?

28:51.500 --> 28:52.541
Why do you care?

28:54.125 --> 28:55.125
You first.

28:55.791 --> 28:58.208
I saw how Foltest and his boy
spoke to you.

28:58.291 --> 29:00.083
Why help those who won't listen?

29:04.708 --> 29:06.875
I'm sure someone as legendary as you

29:06.958 --> 29:09.916
has already figured out several ways
to get past Segelin's guards.

29:23.791 --> 29:24.791
Move away.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.708
Temeria reeks of secrets.
I could sense them.

29:40.041 --> 29:42.458
Just like I could these bodies
before we entered.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.291
I imagine you sense them, too.

29:52.083 --> 29:55.666
Foltest and Adda. What happened to them?

29:58.166 --> 30:01.500
Not answering questions
is a pillar of your brooding charm.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.708
Pretty sure Foltest is the father.

30:29.250 --> 30:30.416
Adda's bedroom.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.750
Do you think he cursed her?

30:39.708 --> 30:40.708
Foltest?

30:43.083 --> 30:44.083
Maybe.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.208
Geralt.

31:42.833 --> 31:43.833
Letters.

31:44.666 --> 31:47.041
From Queen Sancia,
Foltest and Adda's mother.

31:50.416 --> 31:53.458
A Queen Mother
cursing her own children for their affair.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.500
This could destroy the throne.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.916
Sancia wanted Adda
to get rid of the child.

32:00.541 --> 32:02.791
It seems she refused. Repeatedly.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.625
And now she's taken that curse with her
to the grave.

32:06.708 --> 32:08.708
You've served the family for decades.

32:08.791 --> 32:11.166
Was Sancia involved in
dark sorcery of any kind?

32:11.250 --> 32:13.083
No. Of course not.

32:13.833 --> 32:15.625
What was your relationship to Adda?

32:16.416 --> 32:19.916
Well, I like to think that she saw me
as a confidant.

32:21.541 --> 32:23.250
And protector, even.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.041
We used to talk at great length
about her troubles.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.208
She could be very naive.

32:30.583 --> 32:32.291
She ever mention her brother?

32:33.625 --> 32:34.958
Certainly not like this.

32:35.791 --> 32:36.791
She was ashamed.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.083
Or she was frightened.

32:40.958 --> 32:42.708
What if the relationship was not...

32:44.375 --> 32:45.375
consensual?

32:46.208 --> 32:47.208
Hmm.

32:48.541 --> 32:51.541
You think he raped Adda,
then cursed the child to cover it up?

32:51.625 --> 32:53.541
Well, kings have done more for less.

32:55.208 --> 32:56.208
True.

32:57.916 --> 33:00.000
There's only one wrinkle, though.

33:06.458 --> 33:09.083
-Your scent was on her sheets.
-Geralt.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.166
Old ones...

33:11.000 --> 33:12.166
and new ones.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.541
What would I be doing
in a dead girl's bed?

33:19.250 --> 33:22.500
I smelled what you were doing.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.375
Foltest had no right!

33:38.541 --> 33:41.750
He seduced Adda. Abused his position.

33:42.750 --> 33:45.166
He was always nagging her
for attention.

33:46.083 --> 33:47.416
Always nagging!

33:48.041 --> 33:49.250
But he didn't love her.

33:50.875 --> 33:53.625
-I did.
-You cursed the woman you loved?

33:53.708 --> 33:55.958
I cursed Foltest, not her.

33:56.041 --> 33:58.083
Countless are dead
because of your jealousy.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.250
Countless are dead because of Foltest!

34:01.750 --> 34:03.875
He spoiled Adda with his seed.

34:03.958 --> 34:06.208
He refuses to kill this striga.

34:06.291 --> 34:10.416
He lies to his people.
And yet you wag your finger in my face.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.875
If you wanted him to suffer,
you could have just exposed the affair.

34:13.958 --> 34:15.083
And hurt Adda?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Never.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.208
Her memory will not be sullied,
not while I'm alive to protect it.

34:24.416 --> 34:26.291
Tell us how to lift the curse.

34:28.458 --> 34:29.458
No.

34:31.875 --> 34:36.416
Foltest will watch
as Temeria turns against him.

34:37.791 --> 34:40.458
Just as he turned Adda against me.

34:41.416 --> 34:42.458
Hmm.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.250
Unh.

34:47.083 --> 34:51.500
I, Sabrina Glevissig,
offer myself to the Brotherhood

34:51.583 --> 34:55.125
to make good on the promise
of the Spheres.

34:56.541 --> 35:00.625
-To not place power before virtue.

35:00.708 --> 35:03.166
-To respect...
-<i> Where is she?</i>

35:03.833 --> 35:05.541
<i>You didn't hear?</i>

35:05.625 --> 35:08.541
...for as long
as my flesh endures.

35:08.625 --> 35:12.583
Welcome to the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
You may perform your enchantment.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.083
Yenna.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.625
Yenna, what are you doing?

35:21.791 --> 35:23.041
Undoing what you've done.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.958
I'll have my father sign this deed
declaring me his natural-born daughter

35:28.041 --> 35:29.041
and not an elven bastard.

35:29.125 --> 35:32.375
Do you really think this slip of paper
will fool the Chapter? Yenna--

35:32.458 --> 35:33.916
Get your hands away from me!

35:36.458 --> 35:37.458
It was a test.

35:38.458 --> 35:42.083
It was, uh, an idiotic manipulation.
Forgive me.

35:42.166 --> 35:44.333
Can your apology save me from Nilfgaard?

35:45.375 --> 35:46.416
Take me to Aedirn?

35:47.291 --> 35:50.333
-Do they make me more than my blood?
-And you think this will?

35:53.125 --> 35:54.125
Fine.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
Tell them you lied.

35:56.791 --> 35:59.958
Say you concocted this slander
to gain the favor of your precious rector.

36:00.041 --> 36:03.458
It's too late. You missed initiation.

36:03.541 --> 36:05.916
The enchantments are done.
Think clearly.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.958
You're so smart, aren't you?
You know everything.

36:09.041 --> 36:12.291
I'm sorry. I had no way of knowing
how the information would be used.

36:12.375 --> 36:14.458
-But neither did you.
-Do not turn this on me.

36:14.541 --> 36:17.791
We're pretending your precious rectoress
never ordered you to spy on me?

36:21.291 --> 36:23.083
Look, I-I can fix this.

36:24.750 --> 36:28.833
The Brotherhood--they've offered me a seat
on the Research Chapter. Me.

36:29.875 --> 36:32.666
Okay? Neither of us have to go to court.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.375
-You can't be serious?
-We can travel the continent together.

36:39.166 --> 36:42.250
We can be together.
We can forge a whole new destiny.

36:45.416 --> 36:46.541
Ah.

36:47.875 --> 36:51.250
A life holding dustpans
while you brush off forgotten bones?

36:53.416 --> 36:54.625
That's not destiny.

36:57.333 --> 36:58.833
It's slow suicide.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.083
You don't mean that.

37:04.166 --> 37:07.875
Would it frighten you to know you're
not privy to every one of my thoughts?

37:14.750 --> 37:16.000
You are patronizing me.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.291
I was going to Temeria for you.

37:24.375 --> 37:25.708
That was your decision.

37:25.791 --> 37:28.875
You really think I wish to waste my days
gossiping at court?

37:28.958 --> 37:30.458
That's your fetish, not mine.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.375
A true man would state his desires.

37:32.458 --> 37:35.041
Well, how would I recognize them? Huh?

37:35.125 --> 37:38.708
You get off on disguising yours
as my own. Oh.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.166
Stregobor was right.

37:41.250 --> 37:44.083
That's exactly why you're here,
exactly what she taught you.

37:44.750 --> 37:45.750
Everyone's a pawn.

37:45.833 --> 37:47.375
I will not be schooled by a man

37:47.458 --> 37:50.083
who pimps the world
as some romantic adventure.

37:51.541 --> 37:52.958
My world is cruel.

37:53.041 --> 37:54.791
-Unpredictable.

37:54.875 --> 37:56.750
You enter, you survive, you die.

37:58.416 --> 38:01.583
-You know, victimhood is not your color.
-Nor heroism yours.

38:03.541 --> 38:06.583
You're just angry because
you lost your chance to be beautiful!

38:09.541 --> 38:10.791
I want to be powerful.

38:10.875 --> 38:13.333
Seen and adored with everyone watching.

38:13.416 --> 38:15.041
It is what I'm owed.

38:15.125 --> 38:18.208
No amount of power or beauty
will ever make you feel worthy of either.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.291
Let's take a rest, dear.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.833
Foltest, leave your sister be.

39:18.916 --> 39:20.666
Show Madame de Vriess some respect.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.666
What wonderful children, Your Highness.

39:24.750 --> 39:25.750
Thank you.

39:30.916 --> 39:32.250
Your Excellence.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.875
An Aedirnian would surely
have had better footing.

39:48.041 --> 39:51.000
You claim to be
quite the artist. Prove it.

39:52.416 --> 39:55.583
-The Chapter would have my head.
-Do they already have your cock?

40:02.791 --> 40:05.750
-I'll need time to prepare the herbs.
-That won't be necessary.

40:05.833 --> 40:08.375
Don't be foolish.
You can't be awake during the procedure.

40:09.666 --> 40:10.666
I can.

40:40.166 --> 40:42.583
Oh so quick to violence.

40:43.500 --> 40:47.458
Strange, considering what Miss Merigold
told me about you.

40:48.333 --> 40:51.000
-And what's that?
-She told me...

40:52.833 --> 40:53.833
to trust you.

41:03.916 --> 41:04.958
Will this work?

41:06.541 --> 41:07.625
Answer honestly.

41:13.625 --> 41:14.625
I don't know.

41:17.333 --> 41:18.333
Will my...

41:22.875 --> 41:23.958
will my daughter...

41:25.041 --> 41:26.041
be normal?

41:26.750 --> 41:28.166
She'll need special care.

41:29.333 --> 41:30.583
She's lived as an animal.

41:31.375 --> 41:32.750
All she's ever known is...

41:33.666 --> 41:35.666
rage and hunger.

42:18.375 --> 42:19.375
What is this?

42:21.083 --> 42:22.250
For the princess.

42:24.083 --> 42:25.583
If I can lift the curse.

42:27.750 --> 42:28.750
A gift.

42:32.125 --> 42:35.666
You're giving me this
because you do not expect to see morning.

42:35.750 --> 42:38.125
This isn't my first time
trying to save a princess

42:38.208 --> 42:39.625
who others see as a monster.

42:40.750 --> 42:42.416
What happened to that princess?

42:45.541 --> 42:46.541
I killed her.

42:52.625 --> 42:56.750
I did try to resist, at first, with Adda.
We both did.

42:59.125 --> 43:02.833
For all it brightens,
love casts long shadows.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.583
I envy you.

43:09.708 --> 43:10.750
To live...

43:11.625 --> 43:13.541
and never have to fall in love.

43:52.708 --> 43:53.708
Witcher.

43:54.875 --> 43:56.208
This is madness!

43:57.500 --> 44:00.208
What are we doing here? What's happening?

44:01.291 --> 44:02.541
How can I lift the curse?

44:04.333 --> 44:05.333
No.

44:06.250 --> 44:07.541
This is not right.

44:08.625 --> 44:11.000
Foltest must pay for what he did.

44:13.750 --> 44:15.166
Explain that to her.

44:18.625 --> 44:20.833
Carry me out. I order you.

44:22.041 --> 44:23.583
Tell me how to lift the curse.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.250
Sh-She was hiding from the Brotherhood.

44:33.166 --> 44:35.208
She sold me a lamb.

44:35.291 --> 44:38.166
Sh-She told me
to wait until a full moon,

44:38.250 --> 44:40.000
to wait and then to kill it.

44:41.333 --> 44:43.458
And then I recited some silly chant.

44:45.541 --> 44:49.416
And then I bathed in the lamb's blood
until sunrise.

44:49.500 --> 44:54.666
Until the rooster crowed three times.
And that is all.

44:54.750 --> 44:58.583
I swear. I swear.
Now please let us leave.

44:58.666 --> 45:00.291
What was the chant?

45:00.375 --> 45:02.708
It was years ago.

45:08.708 --> 45:10.250
It was Elven. Um...

45:29.750 --> 45:32.708
Wh-- what is it? The--
I-- I've done what you've asked.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.833
What more can I do?

45:35.916 --> 45:38.583
Nothing, unless you can
keep a striga out of her crypt

45:38.666 --> 45:40.750
until a fucking rooster
crows three times.

45:44.208 --> 45:46.375
You're gonna have to fight her till dawn.

45:56.750 --> 45:59.375
Leave my eyes. These as well.

46:10.708 --> 46:13.083
There is a cost to all creation.

46:14.458 --> 46:16.166
A sacrifice that is always made.

46:18.833 --> 46:19.916
To be reborn...

46:21.625 --> 46:22.791
you will bear no more.

46:23.916 --> 46:25.291
Do you understand?

46:28.708 --> 46:29.708
Good.

47:02.250 --> 47:05.166
No. No. Come back here.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.208
Please. Please!

47:08.416 --> 47:11.791
You'd leave a man
bound to die in such indignity?

47:11.875 --> 47:13.041
You're not a man.

47:47.375 --> 47:48.875
Please forgive me.

47:51.208 --> 47:52.375
It was Foltest.

47:53.541 --> 47:55.125
It was his fault.

47:58.625 --> 48:01.083
-I loved your mother.

49:23.541 --> 49:24.375
Fuck.

58:12.291 --> 58:13.666
Yennefer of Vengerberg.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.666
My apologies, Your Excellence.

58:15.750 --> 58:18.416
Please allow me to remove
this misguided girl.

58:18.500 --> 58:21.750
Now, what sort of a king refuses a dance
with one of his subjects?

58:22.666 --> 58:23.666
Vengerberg?

58:24.375 --> 58:27.250
Are you aware that I'm in the market
for just such a mage?

58:28.000 --> 58:30.083
On your lead, Your Excellence.

59:42.583 --> 59:43.875
<i>Geralt...</i>

59:45.416 --> 59:46.416
<i>Geralt.</i>

59:51.375 --> 59:52.375
Renfri.

59:52.708 --> 59:55.291
<i>The girl in the woods</i>
<i>will be with you always.</i>

1:00:02.833 --> 1:00:04.833
<i>People call you a monster too.</i>

1:00:07.375 --> 1:00:08.625
Renfri.

1:00:08.708 --> 1:00:09.875
<i>You choose...</i>

1:00:09.958 --> 1:00:11.916
- <i>You choose...</i>

1:00:21.166 --> 1:00:23.958
Your scars. You heal quite nicely.

1:00:25.416 --> 1:00:26.833
Your will to live is strong.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.208
The princess?

1:00:29.291 --> 1:00:32.333
I've arranged for her to stay a while
with  the Sisters of Melitele.

1:00:32.416 --> 1:00:33.416
But...

1:00:34.250 --> 1:00:35.250
I...

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:38.250
-Her neck?
-She'll heal, too.

1:00:41.041 --> 1:00:43.583
You should know
Foltest issued a statement.

1:00:43.666 --> 1:00:47.416
The honorable Lord Ostrit
gave his life to slay the vukodlak.

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:49.666
Miners are gathering ore for a statue.

1:00:52.083 --> 1:00:55.083
-Anyone else would've killed the princess.

1:00:55.166 --> 1:00:56.333
You chose not to.

1:00:56.416 --> 1:00:59.208
I'll take my coin now.

1:01:00.041 --> 1:01:01.791
I need to get back to my horse.

1:01:06.083 --> 1:01:07.083
Who's Renfri?

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:14.083
Hers was the only name you uttered
over and over in your sleep.

1:01:16.291 --> 1:01:17.291
My coin.

1:01:19.375 --> 1:01:21.000
So that's all life is to you?

1:01:22.375 --> 1:01:23.583
Monsters and money?

1:01:23.666 --> 1:01:25.083
It's all it needs to be.

1:01:31.708 --> 1:01:34.166
You say this is all life is to you,

1:01:34.250 --> 1:01:37.666
but there is a vortex of fate
around all of us, Geralt,

1:01:37.750 --> 1:01:40.375
growing with each and every one
of our choices...

1:01:41.416 --> 1:01:43.583
drawing our destinies in closer.

1:02:02.916 --> 1:02:05.083
I feel something out there waits for you.

1:02:07.625 --> 1:02:08.625
Something more.

1:03:13.125 --> 1:03:14.125
Ciri.

1:03:16.916 --> 1:03:18.250
<i>Ciri.</i>

1:03:19.416 --> 1:03:20.625
Ciri!

1:03:20.708 --> 1:03:22.500
Ciri! Ciri!

1:03:23.416 --> 1:03:25.541
Ciri! Ciri!

1:03:30.125 --> 1:03:31.333
Wha--

1:03:40.291 --> 1:03:42.250
Ciri!

1:03:43.875 --> 1:03:46.916
Ciri! Ciri!

1:04:02.333 --> 1:04:04.291
<i>Ciri.</i>

1:04:04.375 --> 1:04:05.875
<i>Ciri.</i>

1:04:05.958 --> 1:04:07.791
<i>Ciri. Ciri.</i>

1:04:08.958 --> 1:04:10.625
<i>Ciri.</i>
