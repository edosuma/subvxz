Well, the reason that

16:35.578 --> 16:37.037

And you're still

and then I make you

16:52.679 --> 16:55.807
a double scoop ice-cream sundae?

16:55.849 --> 16:57.600
You got it, dude.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.102
Next time,

16:58.852 --> 17:00.102
I'll skip the speech

17:00.144 --> 17:01.896
and go straight

17:00.144 --> 17:01.896
for the ice cream.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.568
Danny, I've got

17:05.900 --> 17:07.568
to talk to you.

17:07.610 --> 17:11.447
Just a minute. Few of Comet's

17:07.610 --> 17:11.447
friends left their coats behind.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.782
This is important.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.782
Listen.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.784
I was dancing with my old

17:12.824 --> 17:14.784
girlfriend Carrie

17:14.826 --> 17:16.327
and they played

17:14.826 --> 17:16.327
Muskrat Love, right.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.621
I had to run right out

17:16.369 --> 17:18.621
of the gym.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.956
You know, of all the songs

17:18.663 --> 17:19.956
about muskrats

17:19.998 --> 17:21.207
that one was my favorite.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.543

17:23.584 --> 17:26.004
Danny, please.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.255
Come on,

17:26.045 --> 17:28.255
I need your help here.

17:28.297 --> 17:32.092
I just kept thinking, what if I

17:28.297 --> 17:32.092
saw Carrie before I met Becky?

17:32.134 --> 17:34.094
You know, like, what if

17:32.134 --> 17:34.094
instead of 10-year reunions

17:34.136 --> 17:36.014
they had like

17:34.136 --> 17:36.014
7-year reunions?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.350
What if I saw her and

17:36.055 --> 17:39.350
what if I danced with her

17:39.392 --> 17:40.560
and what if I kissed her?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.144
And what if I liked it?

17:42.186 --> 17:44.397
What if Becky hears you?

17:42.186 --> 17:44.397
She's upstairs with the girls.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.858
- Becky's here?

17:44.438 --> 17:46.858
- Jess, Jess, come here.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.651
Calm down.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.905
Look, I think

17:48.693 --> 17:51.905
what you need to do

17:51.946 --> 17:53.781
is sort out your feelings

17:53.823 --> 17:56.034
like you'd sort out

17:53.823 --> 17:56.034
your laundry.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.117
Daniel.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.619
Now stay with me on this.

17:58.661 --> 18:02.415
Think of your feelings

17:58.661 --> 18:02.415
for Becky as your whites

18:02.456 --> 18:05.084
and your feelings

18:02.456 --> 18:05.084
for Carrie as your darks.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.711
Now make sure

18:05.125 --> 18:06.711
you do separate loads.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.963
Otherwise a red sock

18:06.753 --> 18:08.963
could get in with your whites

18:09.005 --> 18:10.798
and then you wind up

18:09.005 --> 18:10.798
with pink underwear.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.719
I'm sorry,

18:13.300 --> 18:14.719
these laundry analogies

18:14.761 --> 18:17.013
are highly sophisticated.

18:17.055 --> 18:20.516
Look, I think

18:17.055 --> 18:20.516
Becky's the greatest.

18:20.558 --> 18:23.185
But it's not fair for either

18:20.558 --> 18:23.185
of you to get married

18:23.227 --> 18:25.813
if you're not sure

18:23.227 --> 18:25.813
about your feelings.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.066
Whatever you need to

18:25.855 --> 18:28.066
do to sort this thing out

18:28.107 --> 18:29.400
you better do it right now.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.571
Hi, Jess.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.993
Who's that?

18:39.035 --> 18:40.369
It's the red sock.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.165
What are you doing here?

18:45.207 --> 18:48.878
I'm here to find out why you

18:45.207 --> 18:48.878
walked out on me tonight.

18:48.920 --> 18:52.339
Carrie, I'm sorry if I hurt

18:48.920 --> 18:52.339
your feelings, but..

18:52.381 --> 18:54.550
You know, I thought I had

18:52.381 --> 18:54.550
my whole life figured out.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.678
Then you show up and now

18:54.592 --> 18:57.678
I don't know what I'm doing.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.098
I think you're scared

18:57.720 --> 19:00.098
you still have feelings for me.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.645
There's only one way

19:03.559 --> 19:05.645
to find out.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.855
Carrie..

19:15.696 --> 19:16.990
Well?

19:20.118 --> 19:23.496
Well, that was

19:20.118 --> 19:23.496
a wonderful kiss.

19:23.537 --> 19:26.707
It made me think of all the

19:23.537 --> 19:26.707
great times we had together.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.836
But, Carrie,

19:28.084 --> 19:29.836
it made me realize

19:29.877 --> 19:32.130
that everything we have

19:29.877 --> 19:32.130
is in the past.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.800
So it's really over?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.345
It's really over.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.973
Well, I needed to know.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.725
Me, too.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.227
Thanks for the dance.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.605
Goodbye, Jesse.

19:55.778 --> 19:57.404
Goodbye, Carrie.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.917
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.336

20:09.959 --> 20:12.336
How was your re..

20:12.378 --> 20:13.546
...union?

20:13.587 --> 20:16.174
The most incredible

20:13.587 --> 20:16.174
thing happened.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.216
Really?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.425
I saw my old girlfriend

20:18.467 --> 20:20.887
and she looked so beautiful.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.680
Really?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.849
Yeah. Yeah.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.849
And then, get this

20:24.891 --> 20:27.185
we slow-danced

20:24.891 --> 20:27.185
to our song.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.728
Really?

20:28.769 --> 20:31.147
Yeah. And then

20:28.769 --> 20:31.147
we kissed, okay?

20:31.189 --> 20:32.523
You kissed her?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.067
Yeah, but listen, see--

20:34.108 --> 20:36.569
- You kissed her?

20:34.108 --> 20:36.569
- Listen, one second, Becky--

20:36.610 --> 20:38.821
- You kissed her?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.821
- Yes, I kissed her

20:38.863 --> 20:40.865
But the best part was

20:38.863 --> 20:40.865
after the kiss.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.366
I'll kill you.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.619
Becky, listen.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.121
When I kissed her

20:45.661 --> 20:47.121
I realized that

20:47.163 --> 20:48.748
I never wanna kiss

20:47.163 --> 20:48.748

20:48.789 --> 20:51.625

21:01.844 --> 21:03.846

21:07.225 --> 21:09.685
Well..

21:09.727 --> 21:12.897
It's just part of my past

21:09.727 --> 21:12.897
that I had to clear up.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.067
I mean, let's face it.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.902
Getting married

21:16.109 --> 21:17.902
is the biggest decision

21:17.944 --> 21:21.072
I've ever had to

21:17.944 --> 21:21.072
make in my life.

I didn't know

21:21.114 --> 21:23.741

21:23.783 --> 21:25.534
Well, not doubts exactly.

21:25.576 --> 21:26.702
