WEBVTT

00:01.958 --> 00:03.375
Dad.

00:03.375 --> 00:06.625
Since it looks like
I'm gonna be
the family wizard anyway,

00:06.625 --> 00:08.583
can I just take out
the garbage using magic?

00:08.583 --> 00:09.750
Come on, for practice.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.875
Magic to do your chores?

00:11.875 --> 00:13.708
Are you new here?

00:13.708 --> 00:16.125
Theresa, come on.

00:16.125 --> 00:17.625
A little practice
can't hurt.

00:17.625 --> 00:20.333
Mom, you can't resist
the pout.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Fine.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.208
Garbage man, dumpster land,
givin' a hand to the trash can.

00:40.625 --> 00:45.125
Ladies and gentlemen,
the future family wizard.

00:46.583 --> 00:48.000
What a nightmare.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.875
Keep the clapping going,

00:50.875 --> 00:53.125
because I have
a very big announcement.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.375
I have decided to quit
the wizard competition.

00:56.375 --> 01:00.708
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Russo family quitter.

01:00.708 --> 01:02.875
We are an impressive bunch.

01:04.583 --> 01:06.583
Alex, why would you want
to give up magic?

01:06.583 --> 01:09.958
Well, I figure I'm so far
behind, I won't even qualify.

01:09.958 --> 01:12.583
This way, I can put
all of my focus

01:12.583 --> 01:14.708
into my relationship
with Mason.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.625
And I intend to focus
on our relationship

01:16.625 --> 01:19.083
by giving up many
of my canine urges.

01:19.083 --> 01:22.583
Like rolling around in
this delightful trash.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.583
All right.

01:30.583 --> 01:33.125
Go ahead and
knock yourself out.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.291
She declares her love
for her werewolf

01:35.291 --> 01:37.708
by sacrificing her powers.

01:37.708 --> 01:39.875
Harper, what are you doing?

01:39.875 --> 01:41.416
I'm writing a romance novel.

01:41.416 --> 01:43.375
It's all about this
teenage witch in New York City

01:43.375 --> 01:45.708
who falls desperately in love
with a werewolf.

01:45.708 --> 01:48.333
Witch and a werewolf...
I'm not a witch.

01:48.333 --> 01:50.875
It's not all
about you, Alex.

01:50.875 --> 01:52.583
Well, then, what's
that witch's name?

01:52.583 --> 01:53.583
Al...

01:54.625 --> 01:56.000

02:49.458 --> 02:52.125
Hi. We're looking
for Max Russo.

02:52.125 --> 02:55.583
If he did something good,
it probably wasn't him.

02:55.583 --> 03:00.000
If he did something bad,
we're broke.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.125
Where is he, Daddy?
If I don't meet him,

03:02.125 --> 03:03.875
I'm going to throw away
all of my stuff,

03:03.875 --> 03:05.000
and make you
buy it all again.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.833
Not again, princess.
Please, tell me he's here.

03:10.416 --> 03:13.000
Hi. I'm Julie Cucuy.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.625
- Cucuy?
- This is my husband, Carlos,

03:15.625 --> 03:18.000
and our daughter Lisa.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.583
Lisa saw Max
on this month's cover
ofFuture Wizards.

03:21.583 --> 03:24.375
Wait, wait,
your last name is Cucuy?

03:24.375 --> 03:27.458
That's funny because
that's also the name

03:27.458 --> 03:29.833
of these scary Latino
mythical creatures

03:29.833 --> 03:31.250
that my mom used to
talk to me about

03:31.250 --> 03:33.375
to make me behave
as a child.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.875
That's us. Boo.

03:37.416 --> 03:39.000
We're real Cucuys.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.250
We live here in the real world
just like you wizards do.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.458
Excuse us.

03:43.458 --> 03:47.000
Theresa, I've heard about
these Cucuys.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.416
They are filthy rich.

03:48.416 --> 03:50.375
And it's always been
my lifelong dream

03:50.375 --> 03:53.375
to hang out with
the filthy rich.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.708
I thought your lifelong dream

03:54.708 --> 03:56.708
was to have
a vending machine couch.

03:56.708 --> 03:59.208
The filthy rich
would have that.

04:00.583 --> 04:04.125
Wait, if you guys
are real Cucuys,

04:04.125 --> 04:07.083
how come you're not as scary
as I remember you to be?

04:07.083 --> 04:10.833
In the summer of '79,
I put you to bed every night

04:10.833 --> 04:12.875
with my scary face
under my skin.

04:12.875 --> 04:13.875
Boo!

04:13.875 --> 04:16.000
Cucuys!

04:16.000 --> 04:19.166
I promise I'll behave, Mama!
I'm sorry!

04:23.083 --> 04:25.583
What's she saying?

04:25.583 --> 04:29.875
It sounded like she was
ordering a number four
from Fiesta Express.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.458
There he is.

04:32.458 --> 04:35.125
Max Russo,
the future wizard.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.625
Future wizard?!

04:36.625 --> 04:38.000
What?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.750
Oh, that's me.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.708
You didn't even win
the competition!

04:44.708 --> 04:48.000
That's it. I'm doing
whatever it takes
to get back into this thing.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.708
But first, I'm gonna
draw a silly mustache

04:50.708 --> 04:53.333
and maybe a unibrow
to express my discontent.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.000
Hi, Max.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.375
Hmmm. You're even cuter
in person.

04:59.375 --> 05:01.583
Yeah, we should date so I can
tell you what to wear.

05:01.583 --> 05:04.166
Well, can you start
by telling me to wear
a Viking helmet?

05:04.166 --> 05:05.708
Everything goes
with one of those.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.083
I don't think so.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.583
- Then I'm out.
- He's not out,
he's not out!

05:11.583 --> 05:14.291
You just made a big mistake.

05:19.625 --> 05:22.000
That was awesome.
You should have
opened with that.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.125
I'm Max Russo. Hi.

05:26.416 --> 05:28.625
Credit Union of Wiz World,

05:28.625 --> 05:30.583
John Doe Wiz World
City Prosecutor,

05:30.583 --> 05:34.458
Ah, Wizard Family Competition
Commissioner's Office. 15C.

05:48.125 --> 05:52.708
Welcome to the
Wizard Family Competition
Commissioner's Office.

05:52.708 --> 05:54.250
Can I help you?

05:54.250 --> 05:57.833
Uh, yes.
Hello there, Helen.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.166
I'm Justin Russo.

05:59.166 --> 06:02.000
- Justin Russo.
- Mm-hmm.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.208
Oh, yeah, here you are.

06:09.208 --> 06:12.166
Wait, you're the kid
who exposed wizardry?

06:12.166 --> 06:15.166
Might have slipped out.

06:15.166 --> 06:19.833
You have got some nerve
walking around here.

06:19.833 --> 06:23.583
I was wondering if there was
anything you can think of

06:23.583 --> 06:27.083
to, uh... get me back
into the running.

06:27.083 --> 06:29.250
Helen.

06:29.250 --> 06:32.500
Well...

06:32.500 --> 06:36.708
All right, we do offer
a community service program

06:36.708 --> 06:38.958
that might help you
gain a level.

06:38.958 --> 06:43.375
Let's see what current jobs
are available.

06:47.250 --> 06:52.375
OK. Centaur stable cleaner.

06:54.208 --> 06:57.458
Wizard grave digger.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.583
Really?

06:59.583 --> 07:03.375
Or tutoring a class of
delinquent WizTech students.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.375
Any of those suit your fancy?

07:05.375 --> 07:08.250
Tutoring suits my fancy.
Yes, tutoring.

07:08.250 --> 07:11.250
I was born to shape
young wizards' minds.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.875
- Really?
- Yeah!

07:12.875 --> 07:16.458
- That's so noble of you.
- They call me Noble Justin.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.750
Well...

07:19.250 --> 07:23.875
All right, then. They will be
at your lair tomorrow.

07:23.875 --> 07:25.000
Good luck.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.750
Excellent. Thank you.

07:26.750 --> 07:31.166
And, uh... It was good
seeing you, Helen.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.708
You got the gig, kid.
Give it a rest.

07:37.250 --> 07:38.250
Do it again.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.458
Do it again, do it again.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.500
I've already shown you
18 times.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.875
It's getting annoying.

07:49.875 --> 07:53.208
He was annoying to me,
too, at first.

07:53.208 --> 07:55.125
But he'll grow on you.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.416
There's my little princess.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.416
With her prince.

08:00.416 --> 08:04.291
The Cucuys!
How are ya? Hi!

08:04.291 --> 08:05.875
They are really
hitting it off.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.291
You might want to
put on sunglasses,

08:07.291 --> 08:09.708
'cause the sparks,
they are a-flying.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.625
Good, because we
wanted to invite Max

08:13.625 --> 08:15.333
to our yacht
for a dinner party.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.208
Do you think he would
enjoy that?

08:17.208 --> 08:19.625
Max would be up for anything.

08:19.625 --> 08:23.375
Um, but he doesn't go anywhere
without his family.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.250
I mean, he doesn't do
anything without us.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.625
Especially yachting.

08:27.625 --> 08:31.583
Terrific. You're all invited
to our yacht on the Hudson.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.250
Yacht on the Hudson?
Yacht on the Hudson?

08:35.250 --> 08:38.125
Max! We're going yachting
on the Hudson!

08:38.125 --> 08:40.583
Yachting on the Hudson.
Yachting on the Hudson.

08:42.583 --> 08:45.458
Thank you so much.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.958
We would love to attend.

08:54.333 --> 08:58.083
Uh... could you pop us
some more popcorn, love?

08:58.083 --> 08:59.083
Plain or caramel?

08:59.083 --> 09:01.416
Oh, that.
It was a gem.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.583
Let's embellish it
a little bit. All right.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.875
Um, how about you say,

09:05.875 --> 09:09.375
"Albert, I would
hike through plains

09:09.375 --> 09:11.166
and swim through an ocean
of caramel to be..."

09:11.166 --> 09:12.708
Hey, kids!

09:12.708 --> 09:14.458
Oh, Chancellor Tootietootie.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.125
Just popping in when there
might be someone around

09:17.125 --> 09:18.166
who shouldn't know
about magic.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.250
Just what
I was afraid of.

09:23.250 --> 09:24.958
You guys are still together.

09:24.958 --> 09:26.208
Of course we're together.

09:26.208 --> 09:27.583
That's what you do
when you're dating.

09:27.583 --> 09:30.500
When you're married is when
you do things separately.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.250
Well, I heard you dropped out
of the wizards' competition.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.125
If you're going to be
a mortal, you should know

09:35.125 --> 09:37.250
that the Wizard Love
and Romance Council

09:37.250 --> 09:42.208
strictly prohibits
werewolves and non-wizards
from being together.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.583
What? Why?

09:44.583 --> 09:48.416
The werewolf always ends up
eating the human.

09:48.416 --> 09:51.500
You know that. Werewolves
can't control their anger.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.333
It's just a fact of life.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.958
But we were gonna be together
forever and ever.

09:55.958 --> 09:58.291
So long that I
said "ever" twice.

09:58.291 --> 10:02.458
I would never eat
my little meatball.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.250
See, he's already
looking at you as food.

10:06.583 --> 10:09.083
You guys are through.
It's the rules.

10:09.083 --> 10:13.291
Sorry, but it's time to
board the train to Splitsville.

10:13.291 --> 10:15.458
Choo, choo!

10:15.458 --> 10:19.708
We can't...
We can't be together?

10:19.708 --> 10:21.750
Then that means...

10:23.291 --> 10:25.250
We have to break up.

10:30.291 --> 10:33.208
That's not Splitsville!

10:34.875 --> 10:37.708
I can't be without you.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.875
I can't be
without you either.

10:40.875 --> 10:45.250
After all that we've
been through, it just
can't end like this.

10:45.250 --> 10:48.208
This is awkward.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.708
I always wait too long
before I flash out.

10:53.708 --> 10:56.458
You keep going here
and I'll just leave. OK?

10:56.458 --> 10:58.125
No, no, no, no, no. Wait.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.333
It's actually good
that you're still here.

11:01.333 --> 11:04.250
Who do we have to talk to
at the Love and Romance Council

11:04.250 --> 11:06.083
to see about getting
this rule appealed?

11:06.083 --> 11:10.958
That would be me.
I'm the chairperson of
the Love and Romance Council.

11:10.958 --> 11:13.708
And now it's going to be
even more awkward

11:13.708 --> 11:16.750
when I inform you that
your appeal is denied.

11:16.750 --> 11:19.333
All right, let's
flash it out. Come on!

11:19.333 --> 11:23.125
Alex. Oh, hi,
Chancellor Tootietootie.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.583
Why aren't you getting ready
for the Cucuy yacht party?

11:25.583 --> 11:27.750
My two nightmares
rolled up into one.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.333
Boats and Cucuys.
What a treat.

11:31.875 --> 11:34.833
A Cucuy party?
You're so lucky.

11:34.833 --> 11:37.875
Well, you're lucky, too.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.708
Because we're inviting you
to tag along.

11:39.708 --> 11:43.458
Really? Even after I just
insensitively told you

11:43.458 --> 11:45.708
the heart-wrenching news
that you have to break up?

11:45.708 --> 11:48.750
Yeah. See, that's
the great thing about me

11:48.750 --> 11:50.958
is I do not hold a grudge

11:50.958 --> 11:54.166
or offer things insincerely

11:54.166 --> 11:56.125
in hopes of getting
something in return.

11:56.125 --> 11:59.583
I'm going to a Cucuy party!

11:59.583 --> 12:01.375
I better flash out,
before you change your mind.

12:03.208 --> 12:05.083
Harper, he's gone.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.458
Whoo, all right.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.291
Nicely played, Alex.

12:08.291 --> 12:10.458
For a second there,
I thought you guys were
gonna have to break up,

12:10.458 --> 12:12.083
But once he gets
to that Cucuy party,

12:12.083 --> 12:14.875
he'll be so grateful,
he'll bend all the rules
for you.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.875
Oh, now I get it.

12:16.875 --> 12:19.750
I just thought Alex was being
uncharacteristically generous.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.333
- Me?
- You, generous?

12:28.333 --> 12:30.708
Welcome, class.
Please have a seat.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.958
Make yourselves comfortable.

12:36.416 --> 12:38.458
Or make a mess.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.708
I'm your wizard tutor,
Justin Russo.

12:43.708 --> 12:47.000
I know a lot of you have been
written off by WizTech.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.416
But I'm here to write you on.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.458
It sounded way better
in my head.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.333
Ah. We have our
first latecomer.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.583
Let me guess. Big guy.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.333
Thinks he's too cool
for school.

13:05.333 --> 13:09.166
Let me guess.
Lame-o who irons his socks?

13:10.416 --> 13:14.625
There's nothing wrong
with a crisp toe crease.

13:14.625 --> 13:17.333
Yeah, but there's something
wrong with your mom.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.000
You met my mom?

13:23.875 --> 13:28.250
This is gonna
be a lot more work
than I had anticipated,

13:28.250 --> 13:31.458
but I tell you guys, I am
a person who likes challenges.

13:31.458 --> 13:33.000
Excellent. Let's throw down.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.458
C'mon, pull your
sleeves off right now.

13:34.458 --> 13:37.000
I'm wearing a tie.
I don't think so.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.625
All right, fine.
I'll do it for you.

13:40.125 --> 13:44.708
I just ironed both of them.

13:47.833 --> 13:49.458
Thank you for
having us, Carlos.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.375
This is a beautiful boat.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.583
Wow. How much does one
of these babies cost?

13:54.583 --> 13:55.708
You looking to buy one?

13:55.708 --> 13:57.458
No, just looking to brag.

14:02.458 --> 14:05.000
I am doing great.
Would you laugh?

14:15.708 --> 14:17.958
Man, these Cucuys
really know how to live.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.500
Thanks, Carlos.

14:21.166 --> 14:24.000
Hey, free caricatures
on the Lido deck.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.250
Let me ask you a question.
Is my head that big?
Be honest with me.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.625
No.

14:28.625 --> 14:30.375
I'm glad we brought you,

14:30.375 --> 14:32.583
so you could have
so much well-deserved fun.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.708
Yeah, which you wouldn't have
had if we didn't bring you here.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.875
And also you get to see
what a great couple we make.

14:37.875 --> 14:40.458
You know what?

14:40.458 --> 14:42.500
You do make a great couple.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.750
It would be a shame to
see you two break up.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.583
I like where this is going.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.333
There shouldn't be rules
keeping you apart.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.333
I'm gonna recommend to
the Love and Romance Council

14:51.333 --> 14:54.958
that the rule be overturned.
Congratulations.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.583
I love where this went.

14:57.583 --> 15:00.708
It worked!
We don't have to break up!

15:00.708 --> 15:02.291
What are they
so happy about?

15:02.291 --> 15:04.291
I don't know.

15:04.291 --> 15:07.750
I mean, he's a werewolf,
so what's not to be happy about?

15:07.750 --> 15:09.708
Oh, he's a werewolf?

15:09.708 --> 15:13.000
I like them.
They're cute and dangerous.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.458
That and they can be smooth
when they want to, and hairy
when they don't.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.750
Daddy, I changed my mind!

15:20.750 --> 15:22.458
I want him!

15:24.166 --> 15:28.333
Now, let's continue
our journey into education

15:28.333 --> 15:30.583
with some fun. All right?

15:30.583 --> 15:33.708
Who here has heard of
the Abraca-doodler?

15:33.708 --> 15:37.083
Uh, yeah. Your mom's
an abraca-doodler.

15:37.083 --> 15:38.875
Ooooh!

15:38.875 --> 15:41.250
Doesn't even make sense.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.583
OK. I want everyone
to turn their attention

15:44.583 --> 15:46.708
to this ancient
teaching device.

15:46.708 --> 15:50.458
Whatever I draw on it
will materialize.

15:50.458 --> 15:51.875
Watch.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.125
All right?

16:02.125 --> 16:04.375
- Oh.
- Yes, Felix.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.458
Can I try?

16:05.458 --> 16:08.166
Of course, yes. Yes.

16:08.166 --> 16:11.458
This is good. When you take your
first step towards education,

16:11.458 --> 16:15.250
education takes
a step towards you.

16:16.833 --> 16:19.583
That one sounded way better
out loud than in my head.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.458
A bell!

16:31.458 --> 16:34.458
Excellent. You have mastered
the Abraca-doodler.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.208
School's out.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.125
No, school is not out!

16:41.125 --> 16:43.500
Felix! You raised your hand.

16:43.500 --> 16:47.125
Check minuses, all of you.
It's done.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.750
Hey, Mason.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.083
Max just told me
you're a werewolf.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.750
So, do you want to be
my boyfriend?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.166
My dad will buy you
all the chew toys you want.

17:00.166 --> 17:02.250
Hi, Lisa. Yes.

17:02.250 --> 17:03.833
See, he's my boyfriend.

17:03.833 --> 17:06.208
We just fought for love
and won, so...

17:06.208 --> 17:08.583
And you're on a boat
named after me.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.000
So, I think I win.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.250
Come on, Mason.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.000
Let's go slow dance
in the ballroom.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.500
That's not a good idea.

17:14.500 --> 17:18.458
Ooh, a feisty werewolf.
Even better.

17:18.458 --> 17:21.750
Cucuys are usually terrified
of werewolves, but I'm not.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.583
Mason, I'll take care of this.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.833
You want to see
a feisty werewolf?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.125
You got it.

17:31.500 --> 17:33.291
Hey! Hey, everyone.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.625
Let's play a game called
"Embarrass Your Boyfriend."

17:35.625 --> 17:39.125
I'll go first.
Do you know Mason told me

17:39.125 --> 17:41.458
he sleeps in
a nightgown and cap,

17:41.458 --> 17:43.208
like Ebenezer Scrooge?

17:47.250 --> 17:49.000
What are you doing? I told you
to never tell anyone that.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.875
Oh, I'm sorry, Mason.
Are you getting upset?

17:51.875 --> 17:54.833
Did you know that Mason
can only ride in the car

17:54.833 --> 17:56.083
if his head is
sticking out the window

17:56.083 --> 17:58.875
and his tongue is
flapping in the wind?

18:01.208 --> 18:03.208
Alex, stop.
You're making me mad.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.583
Oh, and here's the best one.

18:05.583 --> 18:09.250
Mason cries if you
just sayOld Yeller.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.833
- Old Yeller.
- Stop it!

18:14.291 --> 18:16.750
Jerry, what is Alex doing?

18:16.750 --> 18:18.875
I don't know, but
the Cucuys are laughing,

18:18.875 --> 18:20.750
and when rich people laugh,
you laugh.

18:24.083 --> 18:27.375
Ooh, this is gonna be good.
It's werewolf time.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.166
Werewolf?!

18:37.583 --> 18:39.250
Cucuys!

18:44.166 --> 18:48.333
Hey! Polyester gets really
clingy when it's wet.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.958
Carlos, Julie,
I'll save you!

18:50.958 --> 18:53.166
- Jerry?
- She didn't mean it!

18:57.250 --> 19:00.125
Good thing I'm always
ready for a swim, huh?

19:03.875 --> 19:04.875
Cannonball!

19:08.291 --> 19:10.291
Maybe I should move.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.958
You can go in the easy way
or my way.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.208
Nice going, wolfy.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.250
Excellent work.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.458
You wrecked
a perfectly good party.

19:34.458 --> 19:38.166
Not to mention a near-authentic
admiral's uniform.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.291
See? What did I say?

19:40.291 --> 19:42.250
Werewolves can't
control themselves,

19:42.250 --> 19:44.291
and that will
put you in danger.

19:44.291 --> 19:45.583
No rule change.

19:45.583 --> 19:48.708
You two need to break up,
and the sooner the better.

19:48.708 --> 19:51.458
Now I'm going to flash out
before this clingy suit

19:51.458 --> 19:54.000
makes it really awkward
for you guys.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.458
Chancellor Tootietoot!

20:03.458 --> 20:05.250
Alex, why did you
make me do that?

20:05.250 --> 20:07.875
You completely blew our chance
of us ever being together.

20:07.875 --> 20:10.166
I know, I'm so sorry.
I just...

20:10.166 --> 20:13.208
I got jealous.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.291
What do we do?

20:16.291 --> 20:18.625
I guess we have to break up.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.875
But we can still
be close friends.

20:22.875 --> 20:25.708
There's no rules against that.

20:25.708 --> 20:31.375
Whatever we have to do
to still be around each other,

20:31.375 --> 20:32.875
I'll do.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.375
Friend.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.375
Me, too. Friend.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.708
- Sorry.
- Right.

20:46.708 --> 20:47.875
- Right.
- Friends.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.416
Friends.

20:50.208 --> 20:54.291
Awww! "The end."

20:54.291 --> 20:57.333
Aw, what a great
and tragic romance.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.458
I did it.
I finished my first novel.

21:00.458 --> 21:03.583
Harper, can you
give me a hand?

21:13.708 --> 21:16.958
I don't know
what I was thinking.

21:16.958 --> 21:20.875
I'm not a WizTech professor.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.291
I'm just a future non-wizard.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.625
Oh, listen, sweetie.

21:25.625 --> 21:29.166
You want to try
the centaur stable gig?

21:29.166 --> 21:31.000
It's not so bad...

21:31.000 --> 21:34.583
...if you have boots
up to your neck.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.833
Hey, Mr. Jeff.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.291
It's Justin.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.000
Yeah. Be happy I picked
a boy's name.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.583
Thanks for showing me that
Abraca-doodler thing.

21:46.583 --> 21:48.083
I'm gonna tell
the rest of the delinquents

21:48.083 --> 21:49.583
that it's cool to
come back tomorrow.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.500
Really?

21:51.500 --> 21:53.625
You hear that, Helen?

21:53.625 --> 21:55.583
Sure did.

21:55.583 --> 21:59.625
You could still turn them around
and get back in the competition.

21:59.625 --> 22:01.291
Yeah, Teach.

22:01.291 --> 22:07.000
Tell your mom you're
doing... a good job.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.375
Is that another mom insult?

22:09.375 --> 22:13.333
No, I just thought she'd
appreciate hearing it.

22:13.333 --> 22:17.625
Ah! You tell your mother
you're doing a good job, too.

22:17.625 --> 22:18.875
Don't talk about my mother.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.833
Just sewed 'em back on!
