00:01.108 --> 00:03.907
Anyone watching thinking
we know fuck all about knowing

00:03.908 --> 00:07.427
fuck all about owt,
needs to watch their back.

00:08.363 --> 00:11.482
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk, sending

00:11.483 --> 00:13.882
prices sky-high...literally.

00:13.883 --> 00:16.802
Literally taking the grass
from its own roots!

00:16.803 --> 00:19.962
And now you've got
your Con-Dem-nation...

00:19.963 --> 00:23.842
Liberals nozzing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.843 --> 00:27.722
Have we had a national fucking
stroke or what?!

00:27.723 --> 00:30.122
Is revolution a word
or was it never?

00:30.123 --> 00:34.122
Anybody watching needs to know,
we cope better than average

00:35.243 --> 00:36.882
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:36.883 --> 00:39.882
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:39.883 --> 00:43.882
and they charge us for water?!

00:44.083 --> 00:48.082
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:48.443 --> 00:51.642
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:51.643 --> 00:54.242
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak!

00:54.243 --> 00:57.522
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.523 --> 01:00.962
This is our England now.

01:00.963 --> 01:04.962
Pa-a-a-arty!

01:13.843 --> 01:17.002
'There was this one fella who
I used to deliver to called Max.

'Strangers are just friends

'I learned to take people on,
not to be afraid of folk,

01:30.523 --> 01:34.202

01:34.203 --> 01:37.082

people have let me down.

'My first boyfriend, that woman who

'Take 'em as you find 'em,

01:54.683 --> 01:58.682
'"suck it and see."'

02:02.603 --> 02:06.282
I'll mark you as a seven.
Usually go a bit younger, you see.

02:06.283 --> 02:08.282
Bigger tits and a tighter...

02:08.282 --> 02:10.521
Yeah all right...
get the picture.

02:10.523 --> 02:14.522
Maybe a six... Shame your boss ain't
a working girl. She'd be a nine.

02:16.963 --> 02:18.562
Lillian?!

02:18.563 --> 02:20.922
Pretty thing, big eyes and a f...

02:20.923 --> 02:23.122
In Lillian's absence, I'm the boss!

02:23.123 --> 02:24.722
Who fucking says so?!

02:24.723 --> 02:25.802
Lillian!

02:25.803 --> 02:29.802
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:30.003 --> 02:31.522
Right. I'm off.

02:31.523 --> 02:34.602
Trixie can't service
this lot on her own.

02:34.603 --> 02:36.042
You'll have to get
stuck in then, won't you?

02:36.043 --> 02:39.402
If you walk out of that door,
you won't ever be allowed back.

02:39.403 --> 02:41.962
I mean it. You're sacked!

02:41.963 --> 02:44.482
You can't sack me.
No?

02:44.483 --> 02:48.482
Huh! No.

02:51.763 --> 02:55.042
I was going to work for the council
but I wanted to spend less time on

02:55.043 --> 02:58.162
paperwork and more time on
the actual job, you know?

02:58.163 --> 02:59.322
Custard cream?

02:59.323 --> 03:00.362
My favourite.

03:00.363 --> 03:01.522
Take two.

03:01.523 --> 03:04.202
Oh, I couldn't.
A moment on the lips.

03:04.203 --> 03:05.162
A lifetime on the hips!

03:05.163 --> 03:07.842
Exactly!

03:07.843 --> 03:10.282
Three piles of dog mess!
I was hoping for much more.

03:10.283 --> 03:13.482
The MP won't take three seriously.

03:13.483 --> 03:15.962
Mum, this is Jenny.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.122
Jenny Taylor.

03:17.123 --> 03:19.642
Jenny's going to be your carer.

03:19.643 --> 03:21.482
Remember you said we
could do with a bit of help.

03:21.483 --> 03:23.922
I said no such thing!

03:23.923 --> 03:26.122
No wonder so many elderly people lose

03:26.123 --> 03:30.122
their marbles, alone all day,
no company except the television.

03:31.563 --> 03:34.682
Antiques here, attic there,
auction this, cash that rubbish.

03:34.683 --> 03:38.682
Oh, finally, a bit of food. I've
had nothing to eat but dust and air.

03:41.523 --> 03:43.442
And then you bring me this?

03:43.443 --> 03:47.442
A bowl of disdain
served up on a tray of neglect.

03:47.483 --> 03:49.362
I work! I have a job now, mother.

03:49.363 --> 03:53.242
You've bitten off more than you
can chew. You can't look after me

03:53.243 --> 03:55.882
and hold down a job.
I meant you should stop working.

03:55.883 --> 03:57.042
Should I just, erm...?

03:57.043 --> 03:59.322
No, no.
Yes!

03:59.323 --> 04:01.122
She's staying.She's not.

04:01.123 --> 04:02.362
She is.
She isn't.

04:02.363 --> 04:05.602
Is.
Isn't.

04:05.603 --> 04:09.602
Is.

04:21.283 --> 04:23.242
I've been chasing you for ages.

04:23.243 --> 04:24.762
Why? Is your phone broke?

04:24.763 --> 04:27.562
Must be, seeing as I get about
a dozen texts a day off you.

04:27.563 --> 04:29.402
Oh, yeah...

04:29.403 --> 04:31.722
sorry about that, I, er...

04:31.723 --> 04:33.762
So, go on,
what do you want this time?

04:33.763 --> 04:37.482
I was wondering if you...

04:37.483 --> 04:41.482
If you, erm...

04:43.483 --> 04:47.282
A hammer!

04:47.283 --> 04:50.362
If you've got a hammer,
I mean, that I can borrow

04:50.363 --> 04:53.202
to put a picture up to my room?

04:53.203 --> 04:55.482
I'm putting a picture up!

04:55.483 --> 04:59.482
I'll pop round as soon
as I get a chance.

04:59.483 --> 05:02.922
A hammer?

05:02.923 --> 05:06.922
Sorry I missed your call.
Been tied up with my stalker.

05:09.763 --> 05:11.522
Sita, Is everything OK?

05:11.523 --> 05:13.482
Chesney's out.

05:13.483 --> 05:17.482
Right.

05:19.723 --> 05:21.082
Are you OK?

05:21.083 --> 05:25.082
I am now.

05:57.483 --> 05:59.482
Kelly, love,
Bonnie's told me about...

05:59.483 --> 06:02.482
Bet she didn't tell you everything.
Swanning around saying she's boss!

06:02.483 --> 06:05.482
She is. When I'm not there, she is.

06:05.483 --> 06:08.082
I know you two have got
a few differences, but

06:08.083 --> 06:10.282
I'd like you to get along.

06:10.283 --> 06:11.002
She's sacked.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.242
She's sacked.
You can't sack me.

06:12.243 --> 06:13.002
I can do what the fuck I like!

06:13.003 --> 06:15.162
Stop it! The pair of you.

06:15.163 --> 06:18.162
You can't breeze in and out of
work whenever the mood takes you.

06:18.163 --> 06:21.042
And you can't sack anybody
unless you've talked to me first.

06:21.043 --> 06:22.682
You're letting her come back?

06:22.683 --> 06:24.562
She's a popular girl.

06:24.563 --> 06:28.562
Bonnie!

06:31.003 --> 06:35.002
Shane, get Lillian a drink.

07:00.803 --> 07:04.802
Marry me.

07:27.483 --> 07:31.402
Did you find everything
you were after today?

07:31.403 --> 07:33.642
Not everything, no.

07:33.643 --> 07:37.642
Well, if we haven't got what you
want, try somewhere else.

07:39.363 --> 07:42.882
You all right, mate?

07:42.883 --> 07:44.562
What's the matter with him?

07:44.563 --> 07:48.562
Search me.

08:07.803 --> 08:09.962
You weren't worried
about me, were you?

08:09.963 --> 08:11.842
I've had a couple
of drinks with Kelly.

08:11.843 --> 08:15.842
Thanks for waiting up for
me though, lovey, it's...

08:15.923 --> 08:17.562
Changing the locks?

08:17.563 --> 08:21.562
Thanks, sweetheart. You can go and
see Trixie now, she'll sort you out.

08:21.723 --> 08:25.162
You can't be too careful. Not round
here. Especially with all the work

08:25.163 --> 08:28.442
we've had done and lights, it's...

08:28.443 --> 08:30.362
Let me in, you daft ha'peth!

08:30.363 --> 08:31.202
Go away.

08:31.203 --> 08:32.001
Pardon?

08:32.003 --> 08:33.042
- Go away. - Pardon?
- Go away.

08:33.043 --> 08:37.042
Piss off out of it. Fuck off.

09:08.083 --> 09:12.082
Good morning!

09:14.683 --> 09:17.402
Now, I don't know how much
assistance you need.

09:17.403 --> 09:19.522
From you, none!

09:19.523 --> 09:21.122
But I thought I'd gently ease my way

09:21.123 --> 09:24.242
into your morning routine by making
a lovely bowl of porridge.

09:24.243 --> 09:25.362
I hate porridge.

09:25.363 --> 09:29.042
My mother used to love
her porridge of a morning.

09:29.043 --> 09:30.162
I am not your mother.

09:30.163 --> 09:32.282
No.

09:32.283 --> 09:36.282
Anyhoo, give it a whirl,
it's a bit of a speciality of mine.

09:42.723 --> 09:46.722
Oh! Too salty.

09:49.803 --> 09:53.802
Too sweet.

09:57.603 --> 10:01.602
Just right?

10:02.723 --> 10:06.722
Yes!

10:08.083 --> 10:10.442
Thanks for taking me
in last night, love.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.442
We weren't going to leave
you out here, were we?

10:16.923 --> 10:19.962
Love you, Mummy.

10:19.963 --> 10:21.922
Right, remember what I said.

10:21.923 --> 10:25.602
We've no idea what she'll do,
so be on your guard.

10:27.163 --> 10:31.162
All right, all right.

10:32.323 --> 10:33.802
Hiya, everyone!

10:33.803 --> 10:37.802
Come on in.

10:44.923 --> 10:48.162
What the fuck?!

10:48.163 --> 10:50.042
Still whiffs a bit
but what do ya reckon?

10:50.043 --> 10:50.922
Classy.

10:50.923 --> 10:52.522
Mint.

10:52.523 --> 10:54.202
Tacky.

10:54.203 --> 10:57.282
It's the kindest thing
anyone's ever done. Thank you.

10:57.283 --> 11:00.602
Did you have a nice time
at the hotel, Lills?

11:00.603 --> 11:02.162
Hotel?

11:02.163 --> 11:04.842
Yeah I booked her in, she couldn't
have stayed here

11:04.843 --> 11:06.162
last night, there were builders
all over the place.

11:06.163 --> 11:09.442
What've you done with all her stuff?
Photos, ornaments.

11:09.443 --> 11:12.122
I know it's not up to much
at the mo, but when Lills

11:12.123 --> 11:16.122
puts all her little piccies up
and that it'll be dead homely.

11:16.203 --> 11:17.522
And this?

11:17.523 --> 11:19.842
So she doesn't have to go down
to the kitchen to cook her meals.

11:19.843 --> 11:21.602
She gonna shit in a bucket and all?

11:21.603 --> 11:24.122
This is Lillian's house
and you can't...

11:24.123 --> 11:26.682
It's not. It's Bonnie's house now.

11:26.683 --> 11:30.682
I've signed it over to her. In case
I have to go into a care home.

11:32.323 --> 11:34.162
You don't need to go
into a care home.

11:34.163 --> 11:35.282
Not yet.

11:35.283 --> 11:38.962
She's my daughter, see. Not by blood.
I've adopted her.

11:38.963 --> 11:42.642
I'm officially Bonnie Tyler!

11:42.643 --> 11:44.402
Turn around, Bright Eyes.

11:44.403 --> 11:45.442
Twat.

11:45.443 --> 11:49.442
Fuck this.

11:53.283 --> 11:57.282
Why have you done this?
After everything we...

11:58.403 --> 12:00.322
I've looked after you, protected...

12:00.323 --> 12:01.842
Helped.

12:01.843 --> 12:03.442
Why do this?

12:03.443 --> 12:05.482
I need someone.

12:05.483 --> 12:09.482
You've got me, and I don't want
owt in return, you've got me.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.402
You've got your own life, love.

12:11.403 --> 12:15.402
Bonnie and me haven't.

12:27.795 --> 12:29.194
What would you like to do today?

12:29.345 --> 12:30.516
What do you propose?

12:32.010 --> 12:34.750
Well, one of the high number channels
has a Last of the Summer Wine marathon.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.074
No.

12:37.294 --> 12:39.417
The History Channel, for wartime?

12:39.418 --> 12:40.657
No.

12:40.658 --> 12:41.817
TV bingo?

12:41.818 --> 12:43.697
No.

12:43.698 --> 12:46.297
Ow! Concentrate on what
you're doing, will you?!

12:46.298 --> 12:48.177
Sorry.

12:48.178 --> 12:50.377
I've had a bellyful of
what this house has to offer.

12:50.378 --> 12:53.657
I want to get out and about
and see the world.

12:53.658 --> 12:56.697
Tatton Park, trip out to Fleetwood,

12:56.698 --> 12:59.697
the theatre.

12:59.698 --> 13:03.697
We Will Rock You
must be on somewhere.

13:08.938 --> 13:10.217
Jackson!

13:10.218 --> 13:13.977
Carl!

13:13.978 --> 13:17.657
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't punch your lights out!

13:17.658 --> 13:18.697
What the fuck?

13:18.698 --> 13:21.257
Letitia's a child!
My child! Stay away!

13:21.258 --> 13:22.577
Listen I'm not...

13:22.578 --> 13:24.697
Texting each other
every five minutes?

13:24.698 --> 13:27.017
That's her! Not me.

13:27.018 --> 13:29.977
She's been following me around.

13:29.978 --> 13:32.257
Look. She's been sending me
stuff like this

13:32.258 --> 13:34.697
all the time, right
and I don't know what to do.

13:34.698 --> 13:37.537
I've been trying to put her off
but she won't take no for an answer.

13:37.538 --> 13:41.537
Here.

13:42.258 --> 13:44.777
I'm sorry.

13:44.778 --> 13:45.937
I'll kill her!

13:45.938 --> 13:48.257
Jackson! You can't go in
with all guns blazing!

13:48.258 --> 13:51.017
Like you said, she's a child.

13:51.018 --> 13:55.017
We could mess her up forever
if we don't deal with this properly.

13:57.018 --> 13:59.097
Make her fall out of love with you.

13:59.098 --> 14:01.977
Do it nicely.
Break her heart and I'll kill you.

14:01.978 --> 14:05.537
I mean it.

14:05.538 --> 14:08.697
She's a sensitive soul,
takes after me.

14:08.698 --> 14:11.657
I am. I'm still scarred by this girl
dumping me when I was 14.

14:11.658 --> 14:13.097
Tracy Russell?

14:13.098 --> 14:15.017
Yeah. Tracy Russell.

14:15.018 --> 14:17.257
Tracy fucking Russell?!

14:17.258 --> 14:18.577
What was that for?

14:18.578 --> 14:21.497
I wouldn't mind,
but she was minging!

14:21.498 --> 14:25.497
She was gorgeous!

14:26.018 --> 14:28.017
That's a good flash, that.

14:28.018 --> 14:30.737
I don't think I were smiling.
Do you want to take another?

14:30.738 --> 14:33.577
No, it's perfect.
I'll upload it later.

14:33.578 --> 14:34.897
Upload it?

14:34.898 --> 14:37.457
To the website.
It pays to advertise, you see.

14:37.458 --> 14:38.697
With a picture of me?

14:38.698 --> 14:41.057
I'm expanding the business, Lills.

14:41.058 --> 14:42.697
Granny fucks, Wayne Rooney specials.

14:42.698 --> 14:44.177
I can't do that.

14:44.178 --> 14:47.057
I just run things, I don't
do things. I just run things.

14:47.058 --> 14:48.577
Not any more.

14:48.578 --> 14:50.617
I wouldn't be able to,
the mechanics...

14:50.618 --> 14:52.177
It's like riding a bike.

14:52.178 --> 14:56.057
But I don't want to. I don't like
it. Never have, truth be told.

14:56.058 --> 15:00.057
New house rules - you suck off
or you fuck off, same for everyone.

15:05.458 --> 15:09.457
Really strong air freshener. To get
rid of the stench of old people.

15:12.058 --> 15:13.497
I thought we were going out.

15:13.498 --> 15:15.457
We are out.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.577
I love you.

15:17.578 --> 15:18.817
Sssh!

15:18.818 --> 15:20.177
I don't care who hears.

15:20.178 --> 15:21.417
I do!

15:21.418 --> 15:22.697
I want us to be together.

15:22.698 --> 15:23.937
There is no us, Carl.

15:23.938 --> 15:25.617
No.

15:25.618 --> 15:29.617
There fucking isn't!

15:31.218 --> 15:34.377
She's not just another fuck! I swear,
I love her. I fucking love her.

15:34.378 --> 15:35.777
Then you're fucked.

15:35.778 --> 15:37.457
You heard of honour killings?

15:37.458 --> 15:39.017
Don't be daft.

15:39.018 --> 15:41.057
You don't know her family, mate.

15:41.058 --> 15:44.417
At the very least they'll cut her
out. She won't have anyone, or...

15:44.418 --> 15:48.217
She'll have me.

15:48.218 --> 15:50.937
It's all down to your faith.

15:50.938 --> 15:53.657
She could never be with
someone who wasn't a Muslim.

15:53.658 --> 15:55.097
I'll convert then.

15:55.098 --> 15:57.897
I mean it, I'll do whatever it takes.
I'll convert.

15:57.898 --> 15:59.697
It's not just about dressing up.

15:59.698 --> 16:02.577
To be a good Muslim,
you have to have a pure heart,

16:02.578 --> 16:04.577
live a good life.

16:04.578 --> 16:08.577
Yeah, I know. And I will.

16:13.538 --> 16:15.577
You've been dealing in stolen cars.

16:15.578 --> 16:18.857
And you've been driving them.

16:18.858 --> 16:21.137
Your admirer again?

16:21.138 --> 16:23.897
You need to sort that out.

16:23.898 --> 16:26.737
I want to sort this first.

16:26.738 --> 16:29.937
I know we've got something.

16:29.938 --> 16:33.737
The way we were yesterday...

16:33.738 --> 16:35.777
..I know you felt it, too.

16:35.778 --> 16:39.377
And I'm sorry for asking you to marry
me, maybe we should take our time.

16:39.378 --> 16:40.497
No.

16:40.498 --> 16:43.297
I'm getting married already.
I'm going to Pakistan.

16:43.298 --> 16:47.297
It's set and everything. Sorry.

16:52.218 --> 16:54.417
When a man and woman
love each other...

16:54.418 --> 16:57.297
But what about when a man loves a man
and a woman loves a woman?

16:57.298 --> 16:58.977
That's different.

16:58.978 --> 17:00.257
How?

17:00.258 --> 17:03.297
Let's just stick to
the matter in hand.

17:03.298 --> 17:06.936
Go on, then.

17:06.938 --> 17:09.656
When a man and a woman
love each other...

17:09.657 --> 17:13.656
You're not going to say a "special
kiss" or a "special hug" are you?

17:13.698 --> 17:16.896
No...

17:16.897 --> 17:20.337
Of course not.

17:20.338 --> 17:21.857
The sperm...

17:21.858 --> 17:24.457
..swims.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.017
It can swim?

17:26.018 --> 17:27.337
Yeah.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.297
Continue.

17:30.298 --> 17:32.377
It swims to the egg...

17:32.378 --> 17:34.817
How does it get there?

17:34.818 --> 17:37.457
I mean, I get the egg bit, yeah?

17:37.458 --> 17:41.217
But the sperm,
how does that get there?

17:41.218 --> 17:45.217
Erm...

17:47.778 --> 17:50.177
Erm...

17:50.178 --> 17:51.697
Er...

17:51.698 --> 17:55.697
Avril!

18:25.458 --> 18:29.457
Collectibles In Your Cellar's
on in a few minutes.

18:34.178 --> 18:35.697
They're mine.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.137
Those chocolates. They're mine.

18:38.138 --> 18:40.257
Oh.

18:40.258 --> 18:43.617
You know,
I don't think this is working out.

18:43.618 --> 18:46.657
Me and you.
I don't go anywhere, do anything.

18:46.658 --> 18:50.657
It's the same as it was before.
But with less chocolates.

18:51.178 --> 18:53.537
I think it'd be best
if you moved on.

18:53.538 --> 18:56.017
You can't ask me to move on.
Well, you can ask me,

18:56.018 --> 18:59.497
but it won't make any difference.
I'm employed by your daughter.

18:59.498 --> 19:03.497
You have absolutely no say
in the matter.

19:16.858 --> 19:20.057
As well as the makeover
and the installation

19:20.058 --> 19:24.057
of the CCTV system to make your working
environment safer and happier,

19:25.018 --> 19:27.537
Bruno here will be on hand 24/7.

19:27.538 --> 19:29.097
A pimp?

19:29.098 --> 19:31.297
His title is
Leisure and Recreation Manager.

19:31.298 --> 19:31.937
A pimp.

19:31.938 --> 19:35.297
Bruno will also ensure that your
payments are present and correct.

19:35.298 --> 19:36.577
Never had trouble before.

19:36.578 --> 19:39.137
Not just from the punters,
but also from the girls.

19:39.138 --> 19:43.137
This refurbishment costs.
This is payback time.

19:43.338 --> 19:45.577
House cuts will rise to 70%.

19:45.578 --> 19:46.777
Fuck off!

19:46.778 --> 19:50.137
You'll be no worse off, there's more
customers coming through the door already.

19:50.138 --> 19:53.297
It's a little knocking shop,
not the fucking Chicken Ranch!

19:53.298 --> 19:57.297
Bruno will also be collecting
200 week rent money from all of you.

19:57.298 --> 20:01.177
Taxi drivers rent their cars,
hairdressers hire their chairs,

20:01.178 --> 20:03.417
you ladies will be renting your beds.

20:03.418 --> 20:04.777
No way!

20:04.778 --> 20:06.977
Feel free to leave any time you want.

20:06.978 --> 20:08.617
I am doing.

20:08.618 --> 20:10.657
You're all free to ply your trade

20:10.658 --> 20:14.657
with the other 10 quid a throw
crackhead girls on the streets.

20:15.338 --> 20:19.337
Because I'd ensure no other parlour
in Manchester would take any of you.

20:25.578 --> 20:28.257
Wake up!
You fucking tramp!

20:28.258 --> 20:29.657
Oh, fuck.

20:29.658 --> 20:30.937
You slept here?

20:30.938 --> 20:33.777
Must've, yeah.

20:33.778 --> 20:35.777
You're turning into your dad.

20:35.778 --> 20:38.057
Look, the police have been round.

20:38.058 --> 20:41.057
They wanted a word with Sita
about that stolen car shit.

20:41.058 --> 20:42.977
Apparently she was IDed.

20:42.978 --> 20:44.457
Could it get any worse?

20:44.458 --> 20:46.817
Had a word with Letitia yet?

20:46.818 --> 20:48.217
Yeah, I'm on it.

20:48.218 --> 20:49.217
Liar!

20:49.218 --> 20:50.497
Go easy, won't you?

20:50.498 --> 20:51.457
Will do.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.377
No, you won't. You'll just stick your
head in the sand, like you always do.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.177
Yeah, and what's it
got to do with you?

20:56.178 --> 20:58.337
I thought you was trying to
be a good Muslim?

20:58.338 --> 21:00.617
What's the point?

21:00.618 --> 21:04.617
Sita's going, in't she.
Fucking arranged marriage bollocks.

21:05.578 --> 21:09.417
Sort yourself out,
Letitia and the police.

21:09.418 --> 21:13.417
Leave the arranged marriage to me.

21:20.738 --> 21:23.857
Oh, good. I was worried
I might have missed you.

21:23.858 --> 21:26.537
Would you take a look at that!

21:26.538 --> 21:28.457
It's all the fresh air, I think.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.057
We've had a trip out,

21:30.058 --> 21:33.337
to that woodland trail on the other
side of the estate. Mere Bottom?

21:33.338 --> 21:36.217
Oh, you don't know it?
Oh, it's lovely.

21:36.218 --> 21:39.057
I'll take you there,
get a nice picnic together and...

21:39.058 --> 21:40.097
What?

21:40.098 --> 21:41.457
It's nothing.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.777
Oh, go on. You can tell me.

21:43.778 --> 21:45.537
Oh, it's just Mum was complaining

21:45.538 --> 21:49.537
earlier that she never goes anywhere.
Clearly, she spoke too soon.

21:49.778 --> 21:53.777
It is quite common for a caree to be upset with
their carer, especially in the early days.

21:54.338 --> 21:58.337
They have expectations which can sometimes
be unrealistic. But not in your mother's case.

21:59.498 --> 22:01.577
There'll be plenty of trips out,
don't you worry.

22:01.578 --> 22:02.617
I'm sorry.

22:02.618 --> 22:06.177
Don't be, she's your mum
and you want the best for her.

22:06.178 --> 22:10.057
And you can talk to me
about anything, you know.

22:10.058 --> 22:14.057
Not just in my capacity
as a carer but also as a friend.

22:25.218 --> 22:28.177
We prefer groups to book ahead.

22:28.178 --> 22:30.137
A little bird
told me what you're up to.

22:30.138 --> 22:31.497
A little bottle-blonde bird?

22:31.498 --> 22:34.457
It's time you were fucking off.

22:34.458 --> 22:37.297
Give us the keys.

22:37.298 --> 22:38.857
Keys!

22:38.858 --> 22:42.537
It's all right. It's all right,
Bruno.

22:42.538 --> 22:45.577
Don't fuck me about, cuntstick.

22:45.578 --> 22:47.737
I can make you disappear for good.

22:47.738 --> 22:48.777
You'd kill me?

22:48.778 --> 22:51.097
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

22:51.098 --> 22:54.737
Well, if you do that, then the tape
of your little threat will be

22:54.738 --> 22:57.497
in police hands
before my body's cold.

22:57.498 --> 22:59.537
Got it?
I like to think I'm fair,

22:59.538 --> 23:02.737
and I respect you as
a fellow businesswoman.

23:02.738 --> 23:06.737
So, I'm going to up your
protection fee to, let's say, 20%?

23:08.978 --> 23:12.977
Plenty of other firms
will take it if you don't.

23:14.818 --> 23:16.257
Shane!

23:16.258 --> 23:20.257
Maguire business,
not Shane and Kelly business.

23:44.698 --> 23:46.217
Libby.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.897
Ssh.

23:47.898 --> 23:50.217
It's really early. I'm off to work.

23:50.218 --> 23:52.137
No, don't go.

23:52.138 --> 23:54.497
Just go back to sleep.

23:54.498 --> 23:56.937
Think Jenny will be here later,
take you out again.

23:56.938 --> 23:59.777
She's not kind...

23:59.778 --> 24:02.297
Just go back to sleep.

24:02.298 --> 24:06.297
I think she's drugging me.

24:09.258 --> 24:13.257
See you later.

24:14.818 --> 24:17.057
Don't go. Please.

24:17.058 --> 24:18.737
If you need anything, ask Bruno.

24:18.738 --> 24:20.977
He'll report back to me
on a weekly basis.

24:20.978 --> 24:24.617
I don't need anything,
I just need you.

24:24.618 --> 24:28.257
Bonnie, love. You're upsetting me,
and you're upsetting the girls.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.057
And you're wrecking people's lives.

24:30.058 --> 24:32.297
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

24:32.298 --> 24:35.737
It's business.
Cut away dead wood,

24:35.738 --> 24:38.377
highlight the assets,
maximise profitability.

24:38.378 --> 24:39.777
What about us?

24:39.778 --> 24:41.217
See ya.

24:41.218 --> 24:42.217
That yours?!

24:42.218 --> 24:43.057
Duh!

24:43.058 --> 24:44.217
Yes.

24:44.218 --> 24:47.537
If you're so well off, why are
you taking everything off me?

24:47.538 --> 24:51.537
I haven't taken, Lillian.
You've given.

24:54.258 --> 24:55.697
You all right?

24:55.698 --> 24:59.697
No, but I will be.

25:01.495 --> 25:05.494
Ah!

25:09.093 --> 25:13.092
Me leg!
I think I've pulled me G-string.

25:13.293 --> 25:17.292
Come on.

25:18.533 --> 25:22.532
Put your arm round.

25:26.579 --> 25:28.418
Had to slip into something cooler.

25:29.368 --> 25:31.887
I think something's wrong
with the central heating,

25:31.888 --> 25:34.127
it keeps playing up.
Brought you a drink too.

25:34.128 --> 25:36.127
So where's this thing
you wanted me to put up?

25:36.128 --> 25:40.127
Oh, that? Oh, I managed it, ta.

25:46.968 --> 25:50.327
Sorry, I tripped or something.
Let me dry it for you.

25:50.328 --> 25:53.087
It's all right. S'all right.

25:53.088 --> 25:54.247
No, come on.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.807
Leave it!

25:55.808 --> 25:57.927
It's a bit embarrassing.

25:57.928 --> 26:00.807
I've got this... skin thing.

26:00.808 --> 26:02.887
Eczema.

26:02.888 --> 26:06.407
But worse, it's flaky.

26:06.408 --> 26:08.727
It comes off in sheets.
And it's contagious.

26:08.728 --> 26:10.407
I'm not bothered, Carl.

26:10.408 --> 26:12.007
I am!

26:12.008 --> 26:13.167
My mum and dad are out.

26:13.168 --> 26:14.767
So who's this ugly lot? JLS?

26:14.768 --> 26:18.287
Jay-Z, Tupac, Snoop.

26:18.288 --> 26:20.447
Oh, right.

26:20.448 --> 26:21.927
You don't like all that shit, do you?

26:21.928 --> 26:22.967
Shit?

26:22.968 --> 26:25.607
Yeah, rap, it's music for
middle class white kids, innit?

26:25.608 --> 26:28.727
They're the only ones daft enough
to listen to all that

26:28.728 --> 26:32.727
pretend gangster bollocks.

26:45.208 --> 26:48.447
How do you know if your kid's got
a nut allergy?

26:48.448 --> 26:50.534
Dunno. Give 'em one, I suppose,
and see what happens.

26:50.535 --> 26:53.453
Give us a bag of dry roasted,
will ya?

26:53.454 --> 26:55.293
She's a bit young, in't she?

26:55.294 --> 26:57.533
Salted, then.

26:57.534 --> 26:59.733
Might go up to Mere Bottom again.

26:59.734 --> 27:01.373
Lovely.

27:01.374 --> 27:02.653
Thanks, Libby.

27:02.654 --> 27:04.053
Look who I bumped into!

27:04.054 --> 27:05.213
Hiya.

27:05.214 --> 27:06.493
That's me done.

27:06.494 --> 27:09.053
Could I have an orange juice please?
And?

27:09.054 --> 27:09.613
Pint.

27:09.614 --> 27:13.293
I could have one myself,
little post-work tipple.

27:13.294 --> 27:16.853
It's not as if I have to rush
back and attend to Mother, is it?

27:16.854 --> 27:18.373
So, you're Patty's carer, are you?

27:18.374 --> 27:18.813
Yeah.

27:18.814 --> 27:22.813
Must be nice to having bit of help?
I can't fault you, honestly I can't.

27:23.134 --> 27:26.853
My grandad lived with us
for years when I was a kid.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.693
He was losing his marbles.
Fucking torture.

27:29.694 --> 27:33.693
Don't get me wrong, loved him
to bits, like you and your ma.

27:34.214 --> 27:36.573
But it takes over your life,
doesn't it?

27:36.574 --> 27:38.253
It completely takes over.

27:38.254 --> 27:42.253
It was a blessing when he eventually
pegged it...know what I mean?

27:48.854 --> 27:52.013
Parents, eh? Can't live with them...

27:52.014 --> 27:56.013
And you can't kill 'em.

27:59.334 --> 28:01.213
Yeah. Yvonne Karib.

28:01.214 --> 28:03.733
She's there somewhere.

28:03.734 --> 28:06.133
It's me mum.

28:06.134 --> 28:09.653
Sorry, is there anyone there
who understands English?

28:09.654 --> 28:12.573
It's Pakistan.
Carl told me everything.

28:12.574 --> 28:16.573
See if we can get the
arranged marriage called off.

28:19.174 --> 28:20.013
I thought you wanted rid of me?

28:20.014 --> 28:21.053
Carl doesn't.

28:21.054 --> 28:22.613
It's got fuck all to do with Carl.

28:22.614 --> 28:23.653
What's going on?

28:23.654 --> 28:25.613
There is no arranged marriage.

28:25.614 --> 28:28.093
I made it up.

28:28.094 --> 28:29.373
Why?

28:29.374 --> 28:32.573
I'm a good Muslim girl,
studying to be a doctor and he's...

28:32.574 --> 28:35.533
He's not good enough for you?

28:35.534 --> 28:38.253
If you think you're better
than him... you're wrong.

28:38.254 --> 28:39.933
He's getting me involved
in all kinds of shit.

28:39.934 --> 28:41.053
Oh, boo hoo.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.213
The fucking police!

28:42.214 --> 28:46.213
I mean, how many junior doctors
do you know with a criminal record?

28:46.814 --> 28:49.013
So I'm going to Pakistan,

28:49.014 --> 28:51.093
but just for the summer,
and when I come back,

28:51.094 --> 28:53.293
I'll tell him I'm married and then
he'll have to leave me alone.

28:53.294 --> 28:57.293
If you go...you go for good.

29:03.054 --> 29:04.093
I went to the cop shop.

29:04.094 --> 29:05.133
And?

29:05.134 --> 29:07.213
Told 'em it was me.

29:07.214 --> 29:07.973
Did they believe you?

29:07.974 --> 29:09.933
Not until I told 'em my name.

29:09.934 --> 29:13.933
Reckon I might get a caution,
maybe community service.

29:15.014 --> 29:19.013
But the main thing is,
you're off the hook.

29:19.334 --> 29:20.653
I've sorted Letitia.

29:20.654 --> 29:24.213
He just wasn't the person
that I thought he was.

29:24.214 --> 29:25.813
They never are, love.

29:25.814 --> 29:27.253
In a good way.

29:27.254 --> 29:30.973
And I've proved that I can lead
a pure life, like a good Muslim.

29:30.974 --> 29:34.973
I've even quit my job
with the Maguires.

29:36.854 --> 29:40.213
I don't feel the same as you.

29:40.214 --> 29:43.813
Look, we had a laugh,
but it's time to move on now.

29:43.814 --> 29:45.893
Move on, grow up.

29:45.894 --> 29:48.373
No. No!

29:48.374 --> 29:50.373
I need to finish packing.

29:50.374 --> 29:51.413
Sita?

29:51.414 --> 29:55.413
You're nothing special, you know.
Just some chavvy lad with a hard-on.

29:56.974 --> 30:00.973
Go on, fuck off.

30:09.174 --> 30:11.293
Home alone!

30:11.294 --> 30:15.013
Hello, hello! Sorry I'm a bit late.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.813
I picked up a bit of shopping.

30:16.814 --> 30:19.173
Patricia? Where are you?

30:19.174 --> 30:22.853
In here.

30:22.854 --> 30:24.573
Isn't Aidan a bit old for marbles?

30:24.574 --> 30:28.573
He ought to be careful, leaving these lying
around. Someone could have an accident.

30:43.014 --> 30:47.013
Mum, I brought you back some chips
for your lunchish tea brunch.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.013
I know you probably won't want them,

30:50.014 --> 30:54.013
but if I hadn't got you any,
you'd just have pinched mine.

30:54.974 --> 30:58.973
S'funny.

31:06.207 --> 31:08.286
This rope's too tight!

31:08.287 --> 31:11.726
I know you're not going to run away,
but I don't want you falling out

31:11.727 --> 31:14.086
and hurting yourself.

31:14.087 --> 31:16.806
Not yet, anyway.

31:16.807 --> 31:20.806
The hurting comes later.

31:24.042 --> 31:26.921
That's it, good girl.

31:26.922 --> 31:30.921
Yes, good girl!

31:32.522 --> 31:36.521
Medicine time for Jenny, too.

31:44.122 --> 31:47.561
I always wanted to go camping.

31:47.562 --> 31:51.321
Never could, though.

31:51.322 --> 31:53.841
D'you know why?

31:53.842 --> 31:55.561
My parents were sick.

31:55.562 --> 31:59.561
All my life, I've been smothered,
confined,

31:59.962 --> 32:02.721
held back by sick old people.

32:02.722 --> 32:06.721
Daddy fell ill shortly after
I was born.

32:07.722 --> 32:09.561
I wasn't allowed to do anything.

32:09.562 --> 32:13.561
No chocolates and television for
Jenny, for fear of disturbing Daddy.

32:19.322 --> 32:23.321
He lay on a bed in our front room
dying throughout my entire childhood.

32:26.042 --> 32:29.601
And the smell, oh, my...

32:29.602 --> 32:33.441
Daddy eventually died
when I was about to leave school.

32:33.442 --> 32:37.321
I'd decided on a career
in medicine.

32:37.322 --> 32:39.801
Then mummy fell ill.

32:39.802 --> 32:43.241
I had to look after mummy,
nurse her until she died.

32:43.242 --> 32:46.921
And when she did eventually die,

32:46.922 --> 32:50.921
after many, many, many
years of sickness...

32:52.882 --> 32:56.881
I was free.

32:59.762 --> 33:03.761
Libby needs her freedom, too.

33:04.042 --> 33:08.041
Do you understand?

33:13.202 --> 33:14.281
Yeah.

33:14.282 --> 33:17.081
Like a collateralized
debt obligation, you know?

33:17.082 --> 33:21.081
A junior tranche will
have the main default risk,

33:21.322 --> 33:23.081
so, yeah, you'll
have to offer them a...

33:24.762 --> 33:26.281
Holy fuck!

33:26.282 --> 33:30.281
It's a bit parky up here, cock,
can you let us in?

33:32.962 --> 33:34.641
How did you get up here?

33:34.642 --> 33:38.641
Window cleaner.

33:51.642 --> 33:54.921
Have we met before?

33:54.922 --> 33:57.321
You think there's a big conspiracy?

33:57.322 --> 34:01.281
A revenge thing.

34:01.282 --> 34:03.201
Like you killed my sister?

34:03.202 --> 34:05.761
No, Lillian, we haven't met before.

34:05.762 --> 34:07.001
Are you sure?

34:07.002 --> 34:09.360
Name one place in the world
you've been

34:09.362 --> 34:10.721
I would have wanted to visit.

34:10.722 --> 34:12.041
Lytham St Annes?

34:12.042 --> 34:13.481
It doesn't make sense.

34:13.482 --> 34:16.561
If you're so successful,
why pick on Chatsworth and on me?

34:16.562 --> 34:19.041
You're a casualty of business,
that's all,

34:19.042 --> 34:23.001
there were dozens before you,
there'll be dozens after.

34:23.002 --> 34:27.001
Is there any way we could get
back to where we were before?

34:33.322 --> 34:35.400
Before we met?

34:35.402 --> 34:37.281
No, I mean Kelly
and the girls are really upset,

34:37.282 --> 34:40.440
and I'd like to make it all right
with them, but at the same time

34:40.442 --> 34:42.601
I don't want to lose you.

34:42.601 --> 34:45.001
You still want
some kind of relationship?

34:45.002 --> 34:49.001
A mother's love is unconditional.

35:36.362 --> 35:38.641
Maybe you should move on then?

35:38.642 --> 35:40.241
Find somebody your own age?

35:40.242 --> 35:42.441
Some brain-dead lad who
smells of yoghurt,

35:42.442 --> 35:46.441
and has pictures of Shakira
all over his bedroom walls? No, ta.

35:53.002 --> 35:55.321
Yeah.

35:55.322 --> 35:57.041
No!

35:57.042 --> 36:00.321
If Carl Gallagher thinks this is
over, he's got another thing coming.

36:00.322 --> 36:04.321
This is just the beginning.

36:05.402 --> 36:09.401
Right, time I was heading home,
see how me bidding's going on eBay.

36:10.402 --> 36:14.281
Charles and Diana
Royal Wedding china mug.

36:14.282 --> 36:17.001
Starting bid a pound,
can you believe that?

36:17.002 --> 36:18.121
I... I'm frightened.

36:18.122 --> 36:19.481
And I'm not?

36:19.482 --> 36:23.481
I've got to walk back on my own!

36:27.522 --> 36:28.881
I'm too young to die!

36:28.882 --> 36:30.241
Hardly.

36:30.242 --> 36:31.921
I haven't said my goodbyes.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.081
To who?

36:33.082 --> 36:35.041
My daughter,
the only thing I have.

36:35.042 --> 36:37.481
Don't pretend you love her now.

36:37.482 --> 36:39.041
But I do!

36:40.402 --> 36:44.401
You won't get very far
with flat tyres.

36:44.442 --> 36:45.921
Mum, Mum?

36:45.922 --> 36:49.921
Libby, Libby!

36:54.802 --> 36:57.761
She should be home,
not out here in the cold.

36:57.762 --> 36:59.361
She's drugging me!

36:59.362 --> 37:00.561
You and me...

37:00.562 --> 37:02.281
we're like Thelma and Louise!

37:02.282 --> 37:06.281
I hate to see you suffer, Libby,
I don't want you

37:06.402 --> 37:08.761
to have to go through
what I had to go through.

37:08.762 --> 37:09.481
It's not fair.

37:09.482 --> 37:11.161
What are you saying?

37:11.162 --> 37:12.201
We'll leave her.

37:12.202 --> 37:13.281
Here?

37:13.282 --> 37:16.081
It won't be murder,
or even assisted suicide.

37:16.082 --> 37:18.281
It'll be natural causes.
Exposure.

37:18.282 --> 37:19.481
She's my mum!

37:19.482 --> 37:21.721
She's a burden on us both.

37:21.722 --> 37:23.841
Well, you don't have to
worry about that any more.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.001
You're sacked.

37:25.002 --> 37:27.881
No!

37:27.882 --> 37:29.721
No, I'm your friend!

37:29.722 --> 37:33.721
You're not, you're really not.

37:34.442 --> 37:36.481
Come on, Mum,
let's get you out of here.

37:36.482 --> 37:40.481
Look out!

37:42.202 --> 37:43.841
You can't be serious!

37:43.842 --> 37:47.841
Time to say goodbye.

37:59.602 --> 38:00.841
Sorry, Mummy.

38:00.842 --> 38:02.241
I'm not your mummy!

38:02.242 --> 38:06.241
I'm not your mummy.

38:12.842 --> 38:14.721
I love you, Mum!

38:14.722 --> 38:15.761
Oh, be careful.

38:15.762 --> 38:16.961
My new coat.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.961
Come on now, get me home.

38:25.762 --> 38:28.041
The other week,
I went out with my friend,

38:28.042 --> 38:31.561
to celebrate my birthday,
my 17th.

38:31.562 --> 38:35.561
We had dinner in this restaurant,
drank champagne,

38:35.562 --> 38:39.561
and ended up in bed back at this
really zsuzsi hotel.

38:40.362 --> 38:44.001
That was my first time.

38:44.002 --> 38:48.001
The first time I had sex.

38:49.482 --> 38:53.041
Sex that I wanted.

38:53.042 --> 38:56.121
I'd done it before.

38:56.122 --> 38:59.441
But never wanted to.

38:59.442 --> 39:03.241
I was forced to.

39:03.242 --> 39:06.441
To make money.

39:06.442 --> 39:10.441
Men, all queuing up to fuck me,
fuck every part of me,

39:11.202 --> 39:15.201
and film me, group sex, one on one,
humiliation, domination...

39:17.002 --> 39:20.161
It's all on the internet,
for everyone to see.

39:20.162 --> 39:22.441
And I did it all.

39:22.442 --> 39:26.441
All from being ten.

39:28.242 --> 39:32.241
Ten years old,
I was put on the game.

39:32.882 --> 39:35.441
By my mum.

39:35.442 --> 39:37.121
Not step-mother.

39:37.122 --> 39:41.121
My actual, unconditional
loving mother.

39:57.682 --> 39:59.961
I'd prefer a cup of tea.

39:59.962 --> 40:03.481
This is 200 quid
a throw stuff, this!

40:03.482 --> 40:06.641
Why would anyone want to spend
200 on a drink?

40:06.642 --> 40:09.081
And what's all this?

40:09.082 --> 40:11.561
This place, your car...

40:11.562 --> 40:13.361
Why would anyone
want all this stuff?

40:13.362 --> 40:15.721
Wouldn't you?

40:15.722 --> 40:19.321
Oh, no, I'd be awake half the night
worrying if it was safe and that.

40:19.322 --> 40:22.361
There's more important
things in life than stuff.

40:22.362 --> 40:23.761
Like?

40:23.762 --> 40:24.801
Us.

40:24.802 --> 40:26.641
There is no 'us'.

40:26.642 --> 40:27.721
There isn't.

40:27.722 --> 40:31.441
I saw your face that day when I
adopted you, and you took my name.

40:31.442 --> 40:33.401
I can't believe that's it.

40:33.402 --> 40:36.481
You're a bit too old for a formal
adoption but a legal name change,

40:36.482 --> 40:39.321
that's a step
in the right direction.

40:39.322 --> 40:42.001
Welcome to the family, Bonnie Tyler.

40:42.002 --> 40:46.001
Thanks, Mum.

40:47.282 --> 40:48.921
It was all bollocks, Lillian,

40:48.922 --> 40:52.201
part of the plan,
I didn't give two shits.

40:52.202 --> 40:53.921
The best actresses in the world,

40:53.922 --> 40:56.321
the Farrah Fawcetts,
Mary Streep, Barbara Knox,

40:56.322 --> 40:59.761
they couldn't have
looked like you did that day.

40:59.762 --> 41:01.521
That wasn't fake.

41:01.522 --> 41:04.121
I looked into your eyes
and we were both a bit teary.

41:04.122 --> 41:05.361
Hay fever.

41:05.362 --> 41:09.281
I saw what I saw,
and I know what you thought,

41:09.282 --> 41:13.281
and that look that you had,
that was real.

41:37.282 --> 41:41.281
One last thing.

42:04.402 --> 42:06.361
I used to want things,

42:06.362 --> 42:09.881
then I realised
that stuff isn't important.

42:09.882 --> 42:13.881
True happiness is what
lies inside yourself.

42:14.802 --> 42:18.001
This might sound a bit daft,
but I've met a lot of people,

42:18.002 --> 42:19.841
and out of everyone
in this world,

42:19.842 --> 42:23.001
or in the previous life,
you are the only person

42:23.002 --> 42:26.401
that reminds me of myself.

42:26.402 --> 42:28.481
You and me are the same person.

42:28.482 --> 42:31.201
What the fuck are you on about?

42:31.202 --> 42:33.401
Me and my mum, and you and yours.

42:33.402 --> 42:35.601
The only difference
is yours loved you.

42:35.602 --> 42:38.361
Did she fuck!

42:38.362 --> 42:40.281
She stayed with you.

42:40.282 --> 42:42.361
Mine didn't,
she left me on a doorstep.

42:42.362 --> 42:44.647
Your mum must've loved you.
She kept you.

42:45.844 --> 42:47.123
Now, I'm not like my mum.

42:47.124 --> 42:48.483
I won't walk out on you.

42:48.484 --> 42:52.483
You've got me for life and there's
nothing you can do to separate us.

42:53.684 --> 42:55.483
I love you.

42:55.484 --> 42:58.443
And you don't have to say
anything back, it's OK.

42:58.444 --> 43:02.443
Silence speaks volumes.

43:05.444 --> 43:07.123
There's nothing I want from you,

43:07.124 --> 43:09.083
although the keys would be nice.

43:09.084 --> 43:12.363
And things to get back the way
they were with Kelly and the girls.

43:12.364 --> 43:14.323
I won't put any pressure on you.

43:14.324 --> 43:15.723
I won't be coming round.

43:15.724 --> 43:17.363
I'll just wait
for you to come to me.

43:17.364 --> 43:21.363
And you'll always be welcome,
darling.

43:59.724 --> 44:01.363
Bye, sweetheart.

44:01.364 --> 44:05.363
Love ya!

44:08.604 --> 44:12.403
'Kids can be horrible to their
mums, little kids, you know,

44:12.404 --> 44:14.763
'you'll see 'em shouting,
throwing tantrums,

44:14.764 --> 44:16.483
'even hitting their mums.

44:16.484 --> 44:19.043
'Nobody else on earth
puts up with that.

44:19.044 --> 44:21.283
'If you behave like that
with anyone else,

44:21.284 --> 44:23.883
'you'd fetch up with no friends,
no boyfriend.

44:23.884 --> 44:25.803
'But you'd always have a mum.

44:25.804 --> 44:27.529
'Mums make you soup
when you're poorly,

44:27.723 --> 44:29.514
'tuck you into bed
at the end of the day

44:29.803 --> 44:33.242
'and someone to give you a hug
when you've had your heart broken.

44:33.243 --> 44:36.282
'There's no-one else who'll do
that for you, 'cept your mum.

44:36.283 --> 44:38.682
'If you're lucky enough
to have one, that is.

44:38.683 --> 44:40.002
'I never had one, me.

44:40.003 --> 44:43.602
'I made me own soup, tucked
myself in and looked after myself.

44:43.603 --> 44:47.602
'It can harden you, that, make
you tough, cold-hearted or...

44:48.203 --> 44:52.162
'it can make you care, make you
want to look after someone else.

44:52.163 --> 44:54.602
'Someone less fortunate
than yourself.

44:54.603 --> 44:58.602
'Make you into a mum.'

44:58.923 --> 45:01.002
Uncle Robert!

45:01.003 --> 45:02.322
Bobbi. With an I.

45:02.323 --> 45:04.402
Scouse transvestite,
hardly convincing.

45:04.403 --> 45:06.002
Two days, Max,
and he's out of here.

45:06.003 --> 45:07.522
B.A.P.

45:07.523 --> 45:09.202
British Alliance Party.

45:09.203 --> 45:10.602
I hope you like white.

45:10.603 --> 45:12.962
I like most whites.

45:12.963 --> 45:14.002
I'm a woman.
Cock.

45:14.003 --> 45:16.162
Woman.
Cock.

45:16.163 --> 45:18.482
You'd do best to remember
who pays your wages.

45:18.483 --> 45:22.482
You work for me, or for him,
not both. It's time to choose.
