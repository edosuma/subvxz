WEBVTT

00:33.477 --> 00:35.345
Shoppers already?

00:35.412 --> 00:36.881
Hey, Monty,
I'm getting outta here, man.

00:36.948 --> 00:38.248
It's Thanksgiving.

00:40.151 --> 00:42.486
What time did they start
showing up last year?

00:43.688 --> 00:45.890
- About noon.
- Noon?

00:49.127 --> 00:50.661
Freaking vultures!

01:12.183 --> 01:13.484
Oh, shit.

01:46.283 --> 01:47.819
What the fuck is that?

02:18.850 --> 02:20.417
Monty.

02:20.484 --> 02:23.520
Yo, Monty!

02:30.695 --> 02:33.064
Oh, what the fuck, Monty?

02:33.131 --> 02:35.365
You had one job.

02:35.432 --> 02:36.935
Jesus Christ.

02:39.771 --> 02:42.874
Monty?

04:43.660 --> 04:46.563
All right, influencers,
time to go.

04:46.630 --> 04:49.300
Come on. Mom's is boring.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.703
Mom's house isn't boring.

04:51.769 --> 04:54.604
Her and Grant are...

04:54.671 --> 04:56.307
well, they're kinda lame.

04:56.374 --> 04:58.876
- He uses Axe body spray.
- I know.

04:58.943 --> 05:01.312
And he farts,
like, all the time.

05:01.379 --> 05:03.681
Come on, Dad.
We had Thanksgiving breakfast.

05:03.748 --> 05:05.850
Talk about sad.

05:05.917 --> 05:07.018
Mom's waiting. Let's go.

05:07.085 --> 05:09.253
Come on, let's go.
Come on, kiddo.

05:11.621 --> 05:13.257
Why do you have to work
on Thanksgiving, Dad?

05:13.324 --> 05:14.959
It's not fair.

05:17.362 --> 05:19.663
Listen, kiddo.

05:19.731 --> 05:22.467
Heroes work on the holidays,
okay?

05:22.532 --> 05:25.703
Cops, firefighters, your dad.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.639
Come on. Come on, let's go.

05:29.707 --> 05:31.075
- Come on.
- I love you, Daddy.

05:31.142 --> 05:33.144
I love you too, baby.
Give me a big hug.

05:33.211 --> 05:34.979
Oh, big squishes.

05:36.114 --> 05:37.749
Hey, hey.

05:37.815 --> 05:41.419
Grant does not work today.

05:41.486 --> 05:43.921
Take that for what you will,
okay?

05:43.988 --> 05:46.290
Okay, get out here.
Love you. I love you.

05:50.161 --> 05:52.196
That's a sweater, huh?

06:13.484 --> 06:15.953
Has anyone seen
my hand sanitizer?

06:16.020 --> 06:18.056
Uh, check the drawer
in the foyer.

06:18.122 --> 06:20.024
Yeah, maybe check
that shithole you call a room.

06:21.159 --> 06:22.592
- Hey, pass the pie, will ya?
- Yeah.

06:22.659 --> 06:24.062
Hey, has anyone
seen a new one?

06:24.128 --> 06:25.096
Uh, check the...

06:25.163 --> 06:26.531
Oh! My pocket's got it.

06:26.596 --> 06:27.698
Honey,
I think your ride's here.

06:27.765 --> 06:28.699
Christopher,
we're trying to enjoy

06:28.766 --> 06:30.368
Thanksgiving dinner, okay?

06:31.235 --> 06:33.438
- You have to work all weekend?
- I don't know.

06:33.504 --> 06:35.206
Is Dad still charging me rent?

06:36.741 --> 06:38.443
All weekend. I love you guys.

06:38.509 --> 06:40.044
Happy Thanksgiving, honey.

06:41.779 --> 06:43.081
Happy Black Friday.

06:55.293 --> 06:58.662
Coming to the ring,
weighing 35 pounds,

06:58.729 --> 07:00.765
looking like
an absolute vegetarian...

07:00.832 --> 07:02.033
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

07:02.100 --> 07:04.068
Chris Godecki!

07:06.636 --> 07:08.638
What's up, buddy?

07:08.706 --> 07:10.408
Come on.
Turn that frown upside down.

07:10.475 --> 07:13.244
You look like you don't want
to be working on Thanksgiving.

07:13.311 --> 07:14.946
Oh, nice booster seat.

07:15.012 --> 07:16.881
Got any juice boxes
for after the game?

07:18.116 --> 07:20.518
The booster seat's for you,
little man.

07:28.059 --> 07:29.393
I hate that this shift
is something

07:29.460 --> 07:30.828
I've done more than once.

07:32.130 --> 07:34.065
So you're feeling good, then?

07:34.132 --> 07:35.766
It's like, everyone's at home
watching football,

07:35.833 --> 07:37.468
eating pumpkin pie.

07:37.535 --> 07:38.736
This is so depressing.

07:38.803 --> 07:41.005
Buddy,
I had to hand my kids off

07:41.072 --> 07:43.508
to their mother at sundown.

07:43.574 --> 07:47.111
Gracie remarked how sad it was
we had Thanksgiving breakfast.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.883
That almost makes me
feel better.

07:51.949 --> 07:54.452
<i>We Luv Toys
loves Black Friday deals,</i>

07:54.519 --> 07:56.387
<i>so come on down!</i>

08:02.260 --> 08:03.261
That's weird.

08:03.327 --> 08:04.695
Why would they
be closed tonight?

08:04.762 --> 08:07.598
Whoa! Whoa!

08:07.664 --> 08:09.267
I guarantee that was
some soccer mom

08:09.333 --> 08:11.636
high on the thrill
of being a douche.

08:11.702 --> 08:14.405
- Black Friday massacre.
- Yeah.

08:21.345 --> 08:23.514
Oh, I don't...
I don't feel good.

08:23.581 --> 08:25.449
You're fine.

08:38.329 --> 08:41.065
Go clock in. You don't want
to talk to me for free.

08:41.132 --> 08:42.767
Ready for the shit show?

08:42.833 --> 08:44.635
What's up, man?

08:54.779 --> 08:56.147
I'd say be careful,

08:56.214 --> 08:58.416
but I bet you're tougher
than any guy here.

08:58.482 --> 09:00.451
You're too sweet.

09:00.518 --> 09:01.687
All set in the back?

09:01.752 --> 09:03.187
Should be.
Keys are in the truck

09:03.254 --> 09:05.356
and I've got
a shit ton of toys to unload.

09:05.423 --> 09:07.358
Thanks, Lou.
Your work's appreciated.

09:11.229 --> 09:12.563
Thought we said
we weren't gonna wear

09:12.630 --> 09:14.131
the same outfits tonight.

09:14.198 --> 09:16.702
Man, I guess
you should just go home, then.

09:16.767 --> 09:19.203
Huh. Don't tempt me.

09:19.270 --> 09:20.838
You brought the shopping
carts back in, right?

09:20.905 --> 09:22.773
Yeah, you bet.

09:25.309 --> 09:26.377
Knock, knock.

09:27.845 --> 09:29.447
Who's there?

09:29.513 --> 09:30.581
A doughnut.

09:30.648 --> 09:32.316
A doughnut who?

09:34.151 --> 09:36.220
I doughnut
fucking believe you.

09:38.089 --> 09:40.258
We still on
for pancakes tonight?

09:40.324 --> 09:41.892
Are you buying?

09:41.959 --> 09:43.361
I don't think
we've ever been introduced.

09:43.427 --> 09:45.763
I'm the artist formerly known
as half to my ex.

09:49.735 --> 09:51.535
Hey,
let me get my holiday bonus.

09:51.602 --> 09:52.837
Nice try, Bates,

09:52.903 --> 09:54.905
but you get it
when you clock out at 6:00.

09:56.207 --> 09:57.875
6:00?

09:57.942 --> 10:01.912
That's a ten-hour descent
into hell!

10:01.979 --> 10:03.314
Oh, my back.

10:04.448 --> 10:05.516
<i>We've got "I-View Sky"</i>

10:05.583 --> 10:07.351
<i>reporting
on tonight's meteor showers.</i>

10:07.418 --> 10:09.453
<i>We've got tips
on how to snap</i>

10:09.520 --> 10:11.322
<i>the perfect meteor...</i>

10:11.389 --> 10:13.124
<i>It's okay to be sad,
depressed, and even suicidal.</i>

10:13.190 --> 10:14.458
<i>Toy does not come

10:14.525 --> 10:16.060
- <i>or pieces that can be...</i>
- <i>Thanks, Sandy.</i>

10:16.127 --> 10:17.528
<i>And reports are telling us now</i>

10:17.595 --> 10:19.630
<i>people should go nowhere
near these things.</i>

10:19.698 --> 10:22.233
<i>And Chucky says
we're all going to die.</i>

10:22.300 --> 10:24.468
<i>Alice, who really
told you that?</i>

10:26.003 --> 10:27.471
Corporate sent cake?

10:27.538 --> 10:28.839
You don't have to eat it.

10:28.906 --> 10:30.641
It's just nice
to know they... care.

10:30.709 --> 10:32.744
They don't care about shit.

10:32.810 --> 10:33.944
I'll take it
to the storage area.

10:34.011 --> 10:35.846
Archie's guys will eat it.

10:44.021 --> 10:45.856
Yo, Godecki,
you see the line out there?

10:47.491 --> 10:50.061
Yeah, it's like something
out of my nightmares.

10:50.828 --> 10:52.229
Are you kidding me?
Old man Peruso

10:52.296 --> 10:54.165
offered to give me
a handy in the back alley

10:54.231 --> 10:56.267
if I promised
to save him a Dour Dennis.

10:57.902 --> 10:59.203
Congrats.

11:00.604 --> 11:02.106
Christopher.

11:02.173 --> 11:03.641
Happy Black Friday, Anita.

11:03.709 --> 11:06.243
Green Friday.

11:06.310 --> 11:07.244
What?

11:07.311 --> 11:09.213
Corporate said
Black Friday was racist,

11:09.280 --> 11:11.750
so they changed it
to Green Friday.

11:11.817 --> 11:14.686
Green like Christmas
and money.

11:14.753 --> 11:16.253
Good to know.

11:17.789 --> 11:20.124
Your undershirt is untucked.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.094
That's grounds for a write-up.

11:29.835 --> 11:31.268
Hey, guys.

11:31.335 --> 11:33.637
Hey, Daddy's at work. Look.

11:33.705 --> 11:36.073
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

11:42.613 --> 11:45.216
- Jesus fucking Christ, man.
- Come on, please.

11:45.282 --> 11:47.051
- Fuck.
- Bathroom.

11:47.118 --> 11:49.520
- Okay, okay.
- I'm parking a Buick, man.

11:49.587 --> 11:51.322
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:51.389 --> 11:53.692
It's in the back room, okay?

12:07.873 --> 12:09.708
Black Friday.

12:09.775 --> 12:11.642
What a bunch of suckers.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.823
Shit!

12:27.859 --> 12:29.427
Yo, Chris!

12:31.362 --> 12:34.298
Yo, Chris, open up!
I'm locked out here again, bro.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.436
Chris, come on!

12:38.502 --> 12:40.237
Don't make me take the main
entrance with those...

12:40.304 --> 12:42.440
Shoppers.

12:48.345 --> 12:49.313
My man.

12:49.380 --> 12:51.115
You know I hold things down.

12:51.182 --> 12:54.218
That's "hold you down."

12:54.285 --> 12:56.454
I'll... I'll get it, I swear.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.122
Thank you.

12:58.189 --> 13:00.291
How about a nonsexual back rub?

13:01.091 --> 13:02.026
Please don't.

13:02.092 --> 13:03.795
All right.

13:03.862 --> 13:06.197
More for me then, right?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.399
You see they gave Anita
employee of the month again?

13:09.300 --> 13:11.202
Yeah, I saw that.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.237
Fucking Jonathan, right?

13:13.304 --> 13:15.539
I came in early five times
this pay period.

13:15.606 --> 13:17.742
He made me learn how to work
a fucking forklift

13:17.809 --> 13:19.243
all for nothing.

13:19.310 --> 13:20.411
It might come in handy

13:20.478 --> 13:23.314
if you ever need
to do some forklifting.

13:24.148 --> 13:25.817
Everybody listen up.

13:37.161 --> 13:41.232
Happy Black Friday,
We Luv Toys.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.534
Some quick notes
before we open our doors.

13:43.601 --> 13:46.570
First off...

13:46.637 --> 13:48.439
<i>From OSHA.</i>

13:48.506 --> 13:50.809
<i>Uh, statistically
when it comes to retail,</i>

13:50.876 --> 13:54.545
<i>there's no day more harmful to
retail workers than this day.</i>

13:54.612 --> 13:56.948
Remember, OSHA
changed their rules

13:57.014 --> 13:59.550
after somebody
was trampled to death.

13:59.617 --> 14:03.454
So look out for each other,
okay?

14:03.521 --> 14:06.223
Also, Dour Dennis
has been recalled,

14:06.290 --> 14:08.559
so if anybody asks for it,
we don't have it.

14:08.626 --> 14:09.694
<i>We never had it.</i>

14:09.761 --> 14:11.662
<i>Some safety issue
with the battery.</i>

14:11.730 --> 14:13.564
<i>I'm not...
I'm not... I'm not doing well.</i>

14:13.631 --> 14:15.332
<i>Doing well... doing... doing...
doing well... doing well.</i>

14:15.399 --> 14:18.970
<i>I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm...
I'm exhausted, exhausted.</i>

14:19.036 --> 14:20.739
<i>Uh, finally,</i>

14:20.805 --> 14:24.943
um, corporate
has contacted me to inform you

14:25.010 --> 14:28.445
that they will not be able
to offer paid breaks tonight.

14:28.512 --> 14:30.414
Thank you
for your understanding.

14:30.481 --> 14:32.650
Fuck this.

14:34.118 --> 14:36.453
Let's quell this sitch,
please.

14:41.392 --> 14:44.194
I know that this
is not ideal,

14:44.261 --> 14:47.364
but this is a really big night.

14:47.431 --> 14:50.568
I would hate for a sour mood
to ruin our sales.

14:50.634 --> 14:52.469
What about our holiday bonus?

14:52.536 --> 14:54.305
Corporate promised us
time and a half

14:54.371 --> 14:55.740
for the holiday weekend.

14:56.908 --> 14:58.542
Yes.

14:58.609 --> 15:01.412
That is still...

15:01.478 --> 15:02.681
yes.

15:03.581 --> 15:05.115
<i>All right, game faces, team.</i>

15:05.182 --> 15:07.217
I want smiles.

15:07.284 --> 15:09.587
What do we love?

15:09.653 --> 15:11.088
Toys!

15:15.626 --> 15:17.494
Ugh.

15:17.561 --> 15:21.465
<i>I got a migra... migraine.</i>

15:21.532 --> 15:23.400
<i>My back hurts, hurts, hurts.</i>

15:25.102 --> 15:27.338
<i>Chris, back here.</i>

15:27.404 --> 15:29.473
<i>I'm not myself.</i>

15:29.540 --> 15:31.843
<i>You're on reg for the night.</i>

15:31.910 --> 15:33.344
All night?

15:33.410 --> 15:36.480
We're short-staffed.
We need the coverage up front.

15:36.547 --> 15:39.249
<i>I'm not doing
well, well, well.</i>

15:39.316 --> 15:41.753
Looks like your massage
will have to wait.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.120
<i>Bye, Chris.</i>

15:43.187 --> 15:44.388
<i>Yet others
are going through much worse,</i>

15:44.455 --> 15:46.223
<i>through much worse.</i>

15:46.290 --> 15:48.793
Wait, Mister? Wait up.

15:51.295 --> 15:53.397
Marnie said
I should shadow you.

15:53.464 --> 15:55.633
I'm Emmett,
but you can call me Em.

15:57.736 --> 15:58.937
No, I can't.

16:00.739 --> 16:02.807
You, uh...

16:02.874 --> 16:04.809
you ever work retail before?

16:04.876 --> 16:06.343
- Never.
- No?

16:07.277 --> 16:10.547
Well, uh...

16:10.614 --> 16:12.483
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret

16:12.549 --> 16:14.953
only a pro like me knows.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.221
Yeah.

16:17.287 --> 16:20.491
When I find myself
in a pickle...

16:20.557 --> 16:25.864
I take a deep breath
and I think to myself...

16:25.930 --> 16:27.699
"What would an idiot do?"

16:27.766 --> 16:30.334
For example, okay?

16:30.401 --> 16:32.169
If some crazy lady
comes up to me and asks me,

16:32.236 --> 16:33.705
"Where's the Duncan yo-yos?"

16:33.772 --> 16:35.272
I'd...

16:35.339 --> 16:37.207
Escort them
to the yo-yo section and then...

16:37.274 --> 16:38.777
No.

16:38.843 --> 16:41.112
No. No.
You're already trying too hard.

16:41.178 --> 16:42.814
You point them in the direction
of fucking wherever

16:42.881 --> 16:45.382
- and they'll find it, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:45.449 --> 16:46.450
- Okay?
- Yeah.

16:46.517 --> 16:47.752
- All right?
- Okay.

16:47.819 --> 16:49.087
All right, get on
out of here, youngster.

16:49.154 --> 16:51.188
<i>Hey, team, remember:</i>

16:51.255 --> 16:53.091
no matter how bad
these suburban savages

16:53.158 --> 16:55.559
get under your skin,
the customer is always right.

16:55.626 --> 16:57.962
Whoo! Yes! It's go time.

16:58.029 --> 16:59.329
Places, everyone.

16:59.396 --> 17:01.933
Smiles, please. Holiday cheer.

17:02.000 --> 17:08.106
I want faces that love toys.

17:08.173 --> 17:11.710
Brian, unleash the beast
in...

17:11.776 --> 17:12.777
five...

17:14.179 --> 17:16.014
Four,

17:16.081 --> 17:18.615
three,

17:18.683 --> 17:20.284
two.

17:20.350 --> 17:21.786
Go, baby!

17:21.853 --> 17:24.321
<i>Go, Black Friday!</i>

17:45.777 --> 17:47.011
Stop it!

18:02.459 --> 18:03.895
Aw, man!

18:24.916 --> 18:26.650
Good job.

18:29.553 --> 18:31.790
Thank you very much.
Happy holidays.

18:34.491 --> 18:35.592
Will you hurry up?

18:35.659 --> 18:36.861
Ma'am, I'm trying.

18:36.928 --> 18:39.296
Oh, get it together,
dickless!

18:47.138 --> 18:48.305
Ugh.

18:52.309 --> 18:54.344
Hey, my turn.

19:00.852 --> 19:02.653
Oh, oh!

19:02.720 --> 19:06.257
Oh, I must have
been good this year!

19:06.323 --> 19:07.959
Oh, Santa!

19:11.062 --> 19:12.063
What's the sitch here?

19:12.130 --> 19:15.266
Oh, pussy boy here
is taking forever.

19:15.332 --> 19:16.968
There's, like, jam
in the keyboard.

19:17.035 --> 19:18.435
Ah.

19:20.738 --> 19:21.739
Sorry, folks,
looks like I'm gonna

19:21.806 --> 19:23.241
have to shut this lane down.

19:26.311 --> 19:28.880
Ma'am, if you would head back
to the Santa's rear village,

19:28.947 --> 19:31.115
- someone will meet you there.
- Ugh!

19:31.182 --> 19:32.884
Dude, what the hell?

19:34.052 --> 19:35.186
Full discloszh,

19:35.253 --> 19:38.522
some guy just blew chunks
all over the ride-ons.

19:38.589 --> 19:40.024
You're cleaning it up.

19:43.194 --> 19:45.096
Th-throw up? Um...

19:45.163 --> 19:47.131
it's... it's a little germy, no?

19:47.198 --> 19:49.499
What about the floor workers?

19:49.566 --> 19:52.469
But I thought
you preferred the floor.

19:53.738 --> 19:55.707
Sawdust's
in the maint's closet.

20:00.044 --> 20:02.446
Ah, these fucking
idiot customers.

20:04.716 --> 20:06.217
Idiots!

20:06.284 --> 20:08.019
Is that what you think we are?

20:08.086 --> 20:09.386
Jesus Christ, lady.

20:09.453 --> 20:10.688
You watch your mouth,
asshole,

20:10.755 --> 20:13.423
or I'll rip this place apart,
including you!

20:15.559 --> 20:17.494
I believe you.

20:31.242 --> 20:33.745
Deep breaths. It's just barf.

20:33.811 --> 20:36.446
You don't have to touch it.
Don't breathe around it.

20:38.016 --> 20:39.416
Aah!

20:39.483 --> 20:41.485
That's way more
than I expected!

20:46.190 --> 20:49.526
Okay, um, sir?

20:49.593 --> 20:51.195
Sir, let's get you some help.

20:55.967 --> 20:58.002
Oh! Holy shit!

21:09.981 --> 21:11.249
Oh, fuck!

21:20.425 --> 21:22.894
Chris, what the fuck?

21:22.961 --> 21:26.731
<i>All customers must vacate
the premises of We Luv Toys.</i>

21:26.798 --> 21:29.000
<i>We apologize
for the inconvenience.</i>

21:29.901 --> 21:32.170
<i>All customers must vacate
the premises...</i>

21:32.236 --> 21:34.138
Yo, took me two years,

21:34.205 --> 21:35.639
but I finally got
the hang of this thing.

21:35.707 --> 21:36.874
Look at that.

21:36.941 --> 21:38.343
Whoa, whoa, watch this,
watch this.

21:38.409 --> 21:40.244
Oh!

21:40.311 --> 21:42.714
So what exactly happened
with that Chris guy?

21:44.481 --> 21:46.084
I don't know.

21:46.150 --> 21:48.853
I think he smashed some woman
with a mini pink SUV.

21:53.157 --> 21:54.993
Right.

21:58.763 --> 21:59.964
Um, ma'am, I'm sorry,

22:00.031 --> 22:01.933
but we're actually
closing early tonight.

22:05.970 --> 22:08.006
What happened?

22:08.072 --> 22:09.539
I don't know.

22:09.606 --> 22:11.976
Came out,
and it was a fucking disaster.

22:14.511 --> 22:16.881
Okay. Go check it out.

22:16.948 --> 22:18.316
I'll keep an eye on Chris.

22:19.784 --> 22:21.152
I'll be back.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.596
I told you guys.

22:32.662 --> 22:35.466
I am sorry
that I crushed that woman.

22:35.532 --> 22:37.634
But...

22:37.702 --> 22:39.303
Check the security footage!

22:39.370 --> 22:41.272
We don't have to check shit.

22:41.339 --> 22:43.174
This is a citizen's arrest.

22:45.276 --> 22:48.545
There is something
really wrong out there.

22:48.612 --> 22:51.416
Yes, something
is really wrong.

22:51.482 --> 22:53.051
We're one hour
into Black Friday

22:53.117 --> 22:55.753
and we're escorting customers
away from the store?

22:55.820 --> 22:57.621
Yeah,
of course that's his concern.

22:57.688 --> 23:01.225
No, no, no, Marnie, wait.
Please, you have to believe me.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.227
She attacked me.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.661
Ask Archie.

23:04.729 --> 23:06.563
Archie went to go check
on that nasty puke bitch

23:06.630 --> 23:09.300
you attempted to murder.

23:09.367 --> 23:12.203
You're going to jail, Chris.

23:14.172 --> 23:16.107
Uh, miss?

23:17.574 --> 23:19.343
Oh, oh, my God.

23:21.179 --> 23:22.612
No, no, no!

23:22.680 --> 23:24.248
Aah! No!

23:28.052 --> 23:29.619
Shit!

23:35.993 --> 23:37.661
Come on, kid. Let's go!

23:44.335 --> 23:47.038
What the hell
is going on out there?

23:47.105 --> 23:48.906
This is some
next-level bath salt shit.

23:48.973 --> 23:51.209
No, it's just Black Friday.

23:51.275 --> 23:52.810
Excitement is in the air.

23:52.877 --> 23:54.378
- Green Friday.
- That's right.

23:54.445 --> 23:56.747
Green Friday, baby.
It's all part of the fun.

23:56.814 --> 23:58.716
It's known
as competitive shopping.

23:58.783 --> 24:01.651
Anita got a black eye last year
and she took it like a champ.

24:01.719 --> 24:02.987
No, no. Fuck that.

24:03.054 --> 24:05.089
Some woman
just attacked Emmett.

24:05.156 --> 24:07.525
It's like she wasn't
a person anymore.

24:07.592 --> 24:09.494
I hit her
with a fucking skateboard.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.862
She didn't even feel it.

24:12.029 --> 24:14.232
- Try calling the cops.
- Oh, no. No.

24:14.298 --> 24:16.467
Do not call the cops.

24:16.534 --> 24:17.802
Are you kidding?

24:17.869 --> 24:19.971
You call the cops,
and this place shuts down.

24:20.037 --> 24:21.239
Now, if we work efficiently,

24:21.305 --> 24:23.207
we can reopen
by maybe 2:00 a.m.

24:23.274 --> 24:25.810
Reopen? Are you insane?

24:25.877 --> 24:28.813
Line's busy.
I got their voice mail.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.381
Did you know the police
had a voice mail?

24:30.448 --> 24:32.350
This is the biggest night
of the year, okay?

24:32.416 --> 24:35.920
Corporate expects us to do
six figures this weekend.

24:35.987 --> 24:37.822
I'm sure corporate
will understand.

24:37.889 --> 24:39.490
Relax. Okay?

24:39.557 --> 24:42.293
I know we all want to go home.
It's a holiday.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.529
Blardy blardy blar.
Let me tell you something...

24:44.595 --> 24:46.330
What was wrong
with that lady?

24:46.397 --> 24:48.065
Am I gonna be okay?

24:53.704 --> 24:55.907
Hey, bud.

24:55.973 --> 24:57.475
Can I get you anything?

24:57.542 --> 24:58.843
Oh, man.

24:58.910 --> 25:01.345
There is something wrong
with the shoppers.

25:01.412 --> 25:02.480
Christopher,

25:02.547 --> 25:05.683
you are not supposed
to provoke the customers.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.785
The training video says...

25:07.852 --> 25:10.288
♪ Leave them be
and then you'll see ♪

25:10.354 --> 25:13.558
♪ The love of toys
is all we need ♪

25:13.624 --> 25:17.828
Anita,
please shut the fuck up!

25:19.730 --> 25:22.200
You wonder why you never
get Employee of the Month.

25:22.266 --> 25:24.068
You know what?

25:24.135 --> 25:25.603
No one gives a flying fuck

25:25.670 --> 25:28.206
about your training videos
or your plaques, Anita.

25:28.272 --> 25:32.076
Oh, I know you don't,
but there are those who do.

25:32.143 --> 25:35.413
The ones who don't care
are the ones like you two,

25:35.479 --> 25:39.450
'cause you have squandered
every single opportunity

25:39.517 --> 25:42.987
that life has handed to you
to do a subpar job

25:43.054 --> 25:45.691
ringing people up
at We Luv Toys

25:45.756 --> 25:47.858
for the rest of your life!

25:50.027 --> 25:51.062
Stand back. Stand back.
Stand back.

25:51.128 --> 25:52.698
I got this. I got this.

25:52.763 --> 25:54.732
Hey, buddy. You all right?

25:54.799 --> 25:55.967
Here, come here. Come here.

25:56.033 --> 25:57.768
Hey, buddy. Hey. Okay.

25:57.835 --> 25:59.503
Okay. Spit it out.

25:59.570 --> 26:01.272
Holy fuck!

26:01.339 --> 26:03.207
Uh, okay. All right.

26:03.274 --> 26:05.876
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay. Hey.

26:05.943 --> 26:08.045
Somebody get me
a fucking pillow!

26:10.248 --> 26:12.850
- Okay. Okay. Fuck!
- Move!

26:12.917 --> 26:15.319
Okay. Okay.

26:15.386 --> 26:17.622
The handbook says
we're not really supposed

26:17.689 --> 26:19.357
to make physical contact.

26:36.107 --> 26:38.309
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:38.376 --> 26:40.244
Okay, okay! Enough!
Enough! Enough!

26:40.311 --> 26:42.513
Protect me.

26:42.580 --> 26:44.750
Oh, God!

26:44.815 --> 26:47.618
Hey, corporate sent that!

26:47.686 --> 26:48.986
Back the fuck up, homey!

26:49.053 --> 26:50.588
Hey!

26:50.655 --> 26:52.423
You're fucked now, Junior!

26:52.490 --> 26:54.792
Sit your ass down.

27:00.732 --> 27:02.033
Was that the new guy?

27:09.240 --> 27:10.608
Hello?

27:10.675 --> 27:12.877
Anyone?

27:12.943 --> 27:14.680
Bartlett won't pick up.

27:14.746 --> 27:15.813
We've got to separate
that kid

27:15.880 --> 27:17.281
from the rest of the shoppers.

27:17.348 --> 27:19.083
You know, the first time
I worked Black Friday,

27:19.150 --> 27:21.886
they separated
shoppers by race.

27:23.120 --> 27:26.490
Oh, great time
for that story, Ruth!

27:26.557 --> 27:28.259
Great time for that.

27:28.326 --> 27:30.594
That's it.
It's not safe in here.

27:30.661 --> 27:32.798
- Can someone please untie me?
- Schaumburg answered.

27:32.863 --> 27:34.298
I got Schaumburg.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.501
Hello, Schaumburg.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.403
This is Jonathan Wexler,
manager of store...

27:39.470 --> 27:41.038
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

27:41.105 --> 27:43.574
<i>Oh, thank God.
Our shoppers are going crazy.</i>

27:43.641 --> 27:46.944
<i>They're attacking us.
We can't get out!</i>

27:47.011 --> 27:48.646
Wait. What?

27:48.714 --> 27:49.980
<i>Listen to me.</i>

27:50.047 --> 27:51.750
<i>Whatever you do,
don't let them in.</i>

27:51.817 --> 27:54.753
<i>And for the love of God,
don't let them gather.</i>

27:54.820 --> 27:56.220
<i>They're building something.</i>

27:56.287 --> 27:57.455
What?

27:57.521 --> 27:59.725
<i>Get... I need...
just don't let them gather!</i>

27:59.791 --> 28:01.092
- <i>Don't let them...</i>
- Hello?

28:02.460 --> 28:03.894
Hello!

28:03.961 --> 28:06.197
Okay, hang up.

28:07.198 --> 28:09.567
Oh, we gotta do something.

28:10.167 --> 28:12.970
I mean, dying in a toy store
isn't how it ends for me.

28:14.638 --> 28:16.640
Does anyone have a car
big enough to fit us all?

28:18.142 --> 28:19.778
Dad-mobile.

28:19.845 --> 28:22.246
Fits seven, but, you know,
we could all squeeze.

28:22.313 --> 28:24.148
- Ew.
- Brian, don't start.

28:24.215 --> 28:25.883
Ken's truck won't be enough.

28:25.950 --> 28:27.184
There's people
on the sales floor.

28:27.251 --> 28:28.652
So we gotta make
a run for it, right?

28:28.720 --> 28:30.287
Do we?

28:30.354 --> 28:31.690
We don't even know what these
things are or what they want.

28:31.757 --> 28:33.090
They want to hurt us.

28:33.157 --> 28:36.227
Oh, yeah, speaking of,
can someone please untie me?

28:37.395 --> 28:39.230
Ruth can't run.

28:39.296 --> 28:43.367
Survival of the fittest...
and non-geriatric.

28:43.434 --> 28:45.603
Those things are the fittest.

28:45.669 --> 28:47.438
You saw Emmett.

28:47.505 --> 28:50.107
We have to stay here
and protect ourselves.

28:50.174 --> 28:52.376
Who knows where else
this is happening?

28:52.443 --> 28:55.546
I say we get everyone
together on the sales floor,

28:55.613 --> 28:58.482
lock the doors, hang tight
till this shit cools off.

29:00.451 --> 29:02.920
You guys are gonna feel dumb
when this all blows over.

29:07.558 --> 29:10.461
Jonathan,
this isn't blowing over.

29:12.596 --> 29:15.266
You know, the company
sends me this cheap champagne

29:15.332 --> 29:17.168
for making our sales goals.

29:17.234 --> 29:21.572
Now, they expect me
to generate revenue tonight.

29:21.639 --> 29:23.441
That's my job.

29:25.009 --> 29:27.545
Your job
is to be our manager.

29:27.611 --> 29:31.215
Protect us. Manage us.

29:32.650 --> 29:34.151
I can't.

29:41.192 --> 29:42.159
Let's move. Come on.

29:42.226 --> 29:43.994
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

29:47.398 --> 29:49.701
Find anyone you can and
reconvene at the service desk.

29:49.768 --> 29:50.836
Oh, and look out for Emmett.

29:50.902 --> 29:53.839
The less we have to interact
with the shoppers...

29:53.905 --> 29:55.072
the better.

29:55.139 --> 29:56.474
Where is everyb... oh.

29:56.540 --> 29:58.008
Shh.

30:10.654 --> 30:12.724
How did all these shoppers
get in here?

30:14.225 --> 30:15.259
The team must've tried
to leave

30:15.326 --> 30:17.394
through the employee exit.

30:17.461 --> 30:19.663
Who knows how many
of those things got in?

30:19.731 --> 30:21.365
I say we split up.

30:21.432 --> 30:23.768
Close that door.
Secure the store.

30:23.835 --> 30:26.570
Ken, you take Ruth and Marnie
through the back hall.

30:26.637 --> 30:28.672
Hole up in the office
until we get back.

30:28.740 --> 30:29.975
Yeah.

30:30.040 --> 30:32.076
Chris, Brian, Jonathan,

30:32.142 --> 30:34.278
we're gonna run recon
to that exit.

30:34.345 --> 30:36.347
No, no, I should be
with the other group

30:36.413 --> 30:39.049
'cause Brian represents me
on the sales floor.

30:40.451 --> 30:43.955
I will carry your grace
to the sales floor as always.

30:44.021 --> 30:44.990
Let's just go.

30:55.099 --> 30:56.066
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

31:15.286 --> 31:16.721
Where you going?

31:17.956 --> 31:18.924
To the bathroom.

31:18.990 --> 31:20.090
Why?

31:20.157 --> 31:21.693
'Cause I have to go.

31:21.760 --> 31:23.127
Ooh, I gotta go too.

31:23.193 --> 31:24.763
I've been holding it.

31:33.404 --> 31:36.507
Your man, so hunky.

31:36.574 --> 31:38.609
They don't make 'em
like that anymore.

31:38.676 --> 31:41.012
You know, fierce. Stern.

31:41.078 --> 31:43.180
A real smolder.

31:43.247 --> 31:45.449
Ruth, he's not my man.
We're not dating, okay?

31:45.516 --> 31:47.451
- Oh!
- Or... it doesn't matter.

31:47.518 --> 31:51.555
Oh, so... so more like
consensual fuck partners.

31:53.557 --> 31:54.926
Wow.

32:03.133 --> 32:05.269
Follow me. Stay low.

32:39.104 --> 32:40.705
Oh, no, no, no, no!

32:45.442 --> 32:48.612
What part of "follow me"
did you not understand?

32:48.680 --> 32:50.214
Follow me.

32:54.052 --> 32:55.586
Hey, so let me know
if you leave the bathroom,

32:55.653 --> 32:57.889
'cause I can always pinch
and run, okay?

33:06.131 --> 33:07.966
- Gotcha!
- What are you doing?

33:08.033 --> 33:10.200
Getting my stash, man.

33:11.069 --> 33:12.704
You can't do that!

33:12.771 --> 33:14.271
Circumstances have changed,
Jonathan.

33:14.338 --> 33:15.807
That's against the code!

33:27.351 --> 33:29.453
- Oh, no.
- What? What's going on?

33:34.425 --> 33:36.094
We gotta get to that door.

33:36.161 --> 33:38.029
Let's go.

33:38.096 --> 33:39.396
Brian, step back.

33:57.581 --> 33:59.450
We're clear.

34:14.565 --> 34:16.735
All set. Come on.

34:19.070 --> 34:21.906
So what do we do now?
They... they got the door shut.

34:28.645 --> 34:30.314
What are the shoppers doing?

34:34.485 --> 34:37.188
Ruth, wait here.

34:37.254 --> 34:38.857
Okay.

35:54.598 --> 35:56.901
You park that Buick?

36:00.138 --> 36:01.172
- Johnathan!
- Shit!

36:14.919 --> 36:15.987
Jonathan!

36:23.460 --> 36:25.730
Oh!

36:53.390 --> 36:55.226
Are we safe up here?

36:55.293 --> 36:56.660
Define safe.

37:01.498 --> 37:03.667
Ken, come on.

37:03.735 --> 37:05.402
I think we were safer
in my office.

37:06.237 --> 37:08.206
The doors are closed.
Now we wait, yeah?

37:08.273 --> 37:10.208
No, no, no. We can't wait.

37:10.275 --> 37:12.143
I'm with her.

37:12.210 --> 37:14.245
Lou was in there
and he was trying to eat me

37:14.312 --> 37:15.780
or pull me into him.

37:15.847 --> 37:18.049
- He was trying to...
- Gather?

37:18.116 --> 37:19.416
Exactly.

37:19.483 --> 37:20.752
Just like Schaumburg said.

37:20.818 --> 37:22.320
Yeah, they're doing it
at Santa's village.

37:22.387 --> 37:23.654
I saw something.

37:23.721 --> 37:25.023
I don't know what it was,
but I think the shoppers

37:25.089 --> 37:26.456
are trying to reach each other
and...

37:26.523 --> 37:28.625
At this point,
we're just in their way.

37:28.693 --> 37:30.128
We're gonna have to fight
whatever's left.

37:30.194 --> 37:31.561
Whoa, whoa.

37:31.628 --> 37:33.097
God damn it.

37:33.164 --> 37:34.564
What's wrong?

37:34.631 --> 37:36.533
I can't get dinner
with my kids.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.635
I can't get a drink at work.

37:38.703 --> 37:41.739
I can't even get
a goddamn text to send.

37:43.374 --> 37:45.209
Uh... I'll go get that.

37:46.411 --> 37:48.913
You know what?
I'm getting my bonus

37:48.980 --> 37:50.547
and I'm getting
the fuck outta here.

37:50.614 --> 37:52.516
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:52.582 --> 37:54.018
Jonathan, give me the keys.

37:54.085 --> 37:55.652
Oh, uh...

37:55.720 --> 37:57.989
I left the keys in my office.

37:59.023 --> 38:00.457
Archie.

38:11.869 --> 38:13.603
Where's the holiday bonuses?

38:16.240 --> 38:18.710
Are they, like,
in your office or something?

38:18.776 --> 38:20.845
I thought that I told you

38:20.912 --> 38:24.949
that there were gonna be
no holiday bonuses this year.

38:26.184 --> 38:27.685
What the fuck?

38:27.752 --> 38:30.487
Jonathan, this is bullshit
even for you.

38:33.791 --> 38:35.994
That's not what you told me.

38:36.060 --> 38:39.464
All you said was that there'd
be layoffs after the holidays.

38:39.563 --> 38:43.234
Whoa!
What the hell? Like who?

38:43.301 --> 38:45.569
I mean, fo' sho' you
with them bathroom breaks.

38:45.635 --> 38:47.105
I wash my fucking hands!

38:47.171 --> 38:48.638
This place is a cesspool!

38:48.706 --> 38:50.775
Hey, guys, shut up.

38:50.842 --> 38:53.711
Jonathan, is this true?

38:53.778 --> 38:56.014
♪ Little girl ♪

38:56.080 --> 38:57.715
Well...

38:57.782 --> 39:00.685
it isn't not untrue.

39:00.752 --> 39:03.021
- Oh, my God.
- I mean, yeah, yes, it's true.

39:06.257 --> 39:09.060
I quit, you fucking joke.

39:09.127 --> 39:10.161
For your nose.

39:12.063 --> 39:14.631
Ruth, get away
from the window.

39:14.699 --> 39:16.666
No, the police are here.

39:16.734 --> 39:18.870
Oh, thank God!

39:30.281 --> 39:33.017
Hey, Brian, wait up!

39:33.084 --> 39:34.318
No!

39:36.586 --> 39:38.588
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

39:42.260 --> 39:43.294
Go!

39:57.607 --> 39:59.744
Oh, God!

40:06.784 --> 40:08.019
They're all headed for that.

40:09.586 --> 40:11.322
What is that thing?

40:11.389 --> 40:12.356
Let's go.

40:16.727 --> 40:18.096
Chris, go.

40:18.162 --> 40:19.831
No, man.

40:19.897 --> 40:23.201
Chris, I'ma hold you down.

40:23.267 --> 40:24.634
Now go. Go!

40:48.392 --> 40:51.362
Got your doorbusters
right here, motherfucker.

42:14.645 --> 42:15.713
Oh!

42:24.222 --> 42:25.756
Ken, block the door!

42:40.805 --> 42:42.073
Oh!

42:52.183 --> 42:54.051
They're never really dead.

42:57.455 --> 42:58.856
Archie?

43:02.728 --> 43:05.529
If they got to him,
what the hell are we gonna do?

43:05.596 --> 43:08.099
I don't think this night
can get any worse.

43:14.405 --> 43:16.907
Okay.

43:16.974 --> 43:18.744
Does anybody else
just think that's funny?

43:22.480 --> 43:24.282
How long do you think
that door will hold?

43:26.450 --> 43:29.487
It's the only idea we've got
and it's gotten us this far.

43:29.553 --> 43:31.856
It's safe for now.

43:33.124 --> 43:35.092
My name is Emmett,
and I have loved toys

43:35.159 --> 43:36.927
since the first of the month.

43:46.037 --> 43:48.472
I think that
that is the shortest

43:48.539 --> 43:49.708
anyone has ever worked here.

43:59.751 --> 44:03.054
I have loved toys
for eight years.

44:04.855 --> 44:06.824
I wanted
to be a dentist, you know.

44:09.593 --> 44:11.797
Ten years.

44:11.862 --> 44:13.331
Got laid off.

44:14.733 --> 44:16.600
Told my wife it'd be temporary.

44:22.073 --> 44:23.607
Four years.

44:25.176 --> 44:28.079
I'd throw my name tag
in the middle, but I lost mine.

44:31.817 --> 44:33.117
Two years.

44:34.118 --> 44:35.419
Imagine making your living

44:35.486 --> 44:37.121
at the place
you begged your mom and dad

44:37.188 --> 44:38.889
to take you to
when you were younger.

44:45.629 --> 44:49.367
I ran home to tell my dad
after I got hired,

44:49.433 --> 44:50.935
and he goes...

44:52.970 --> 44:55.039
"Welcome
to corporate hell, kid."

44:56.207 --> 44:58.844
This place isn't impressive.

44:58.909 --> 45:02.580
It isn't fun or magical.

45:02.646 --> 45:04.348
It's a prison.

45:04.415 --> 45:05.950
It's a ruse.

45:08.720 --> 45:09.987
It's a lie.

45:11.322 --> 45:12.656
Well, that just sucks,
you know,

45:12.724 --> 45:16.026
'cause I always saw you
as manager material.

45:19.530 --> 45:21.132
Shut up, Jonathan.

45:22.633 --> 45:27.138
You guys want to know why
I applied here 27 years ago?

45:28.139 --> 45:29.974
I was lonely.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.710
I believe that there's
a place for everyone,

45:31.777 --> 45:34.345
and this is my place.

45:34.412 --> 45:35.747
It's a place
where you have worth,

45:35.814 --> 45:38.182
where regional managers
call you and ask for numbers,

45:38.249 --> 45:40.651
where you can reprimand
somebody

45:40.719 --> 45:43.855
and they have to listen to you.

45:43.921 --> 45:46.957
Where the women have to laugh
at all your corny jokes

45:47.024 --> 45:49.960
and even the coolest guys
have to obey.

45:51.462 --> 45:54.131
That's what We Luv Toys
means to me.

45:59.203 --> 46:01.372
That's some dark shit
right there.

46:01.439 --> 46:04.475
I legitimately always thought
you were a serial killer.

46:11.215 --> 46:12.751
I can't believe
I missed Thanksgiving

46:12.818 --> 46:15.519
with my family for this.

46:15.586 --> 46:18.690
Well, at least you were
invited to a Thanksgiving.

46:20.324 --> 46:23.594
I'm sorry. Truly.

46:28.232 --> 46:29.600
What are you doing?

46:52.623 --> 46:54.693
No one should be
without Thanksgiving.

46:57.963 --> 46:59.263
Turkey.

47:00.531 --> 47:02.132
Thank you.

47:02.199 --> 47:04.235
Cranberry.

47:05.837 --> 47:07.271
Football.

47:08.974 --> 47:10.040
Black Friday.

47:11.609 --> 47:13.377
Here's some Black Friday
trivia.

47:14.445 --> 47:16.614
The phrase was first used
by Philly cops

47:16.681 --> 47:17.716
to describe the crowds

47:17.782 --> 47:20.117
and the traffic
the day after the holiday.

47:20.184 --> 47:22.286
Mm!
And here's some retail trivia.

47:22.353 --> 47:25.757
The promise of savings
is an illusion

47:25.824 --> 47:28.425
'cause everything they put
out there is sold at a loss

47:28.492 --> 47:30.494
to get you through the door.

47:30.561 --> 47:32.663
Things are still selling
for a high margin too.

47:32.731 --> 47:34.498
So yeah, sure.

47:34.565 --> 47:36.600
Go ahead and get
that cheap flat-screen TV,

47:36.667 --> 47:39.136
but now you need
the wall mount and the cables.

47:40.070 --> 47:41.639
Customers aren't always right.

47:41.706 --> 47:43.708
They just want to think
that they are.

47:44.776 --> 47:45.710
Jesus Christ.

47:45.777 --> 47:47.244
Mm.

47:47.311 --> 47:49.446
Well,
for our last Thanksgiving meal,

47:49.513 --> 47:51.816
- it sure was informative.
- No.

47:51.883 --> 47:54.019
Don't say that.

47:54.084 --> 47:55.486
Don't say this
is our last.

47:55.553 --> 47:57.054
I think she was
just making a joke.

47:57.121 --> 47:58.790
No.
I got two kids out there

47:58.857 --> 48:00.257
that I plan to see again.

48:00.324 --> 48:02.961
Calm down. We get it.

48:03.028 --> 48:04.528
You don't know shit, Chris.

48:05.997 --> 48:08.566
- You don't have a...
- I don't have a what, Ken?

48:08.632 --> 48:10.702
A family that gives a shit
about me?

48:12.704 --> 48:13.571
Maybe you're right.

48:13.637 --> 48:15.272
But at least
I don't love it here.

48:16.206 --> 48:17.508
I don't love it here.

48:18.977 --> 48:20.444
Look at how hard you try

48:20.511 --> 48:23.080
to be the coolest person
working at We Luv Toys.

48:23.147 --> 48:24.716
Guys, can we not do this
right now?

48:24.783 --> 48:26.216
Me?

48:26.283 --> 48:27.384
You're the one that's always

48:27.451 --> 48:29.353
trying to get employee
of the month.

48:29.420 --> 48:31.088
It's a fake award, Christopher.

48:31.155 --> 48:33.123
Don't blame me
for trying my best.

48:33.190 --> 48:35.026
Your best.

48:35.092 --> 48:36.995
You call this your best?

48:37.062 --> 48:40.164
I've never seen a bigger waste
of potential in my life.

48:40.230 --> 48:42.666
Oh, fuck off!

48:42.734 --> 48:44.268
You try to give me
all these tips

48:44.335 --> 48:47.304
about how to live
and when you were my age.

48:47.371 --> 48:49.473
You're not my age.

48:49.540 --> 48:52.944
I still have time to realize
that this job was a mistake.

48:53.011 --> 48:54.846
You got a lot to learn, kid.

48:54.913 --> 48:56.881
"Kid."

48:56.948 --> 48:58.850
I'm not your kid.

48:58.917 --> 49:01.518
You see me way too often
to be your actual child.

49:10.795 --> 49:12.296
Don't.

49:12.363 --> 49:14.933
At least I acknowledge
that this job bums me out.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.569
But, my God, you treat it
like it's high school,

49:18.636 --> 49:20.604
like you're the cool guy
in shop,

49:20.671 --> 49:22.774
dating someone
20 years younger than you.

49:22.841 --> 49:24.675
Okay, we're not dating.

49:31.348 --> 49:32.717
I thought we were a thing.

49:32.784 --> 49:33.885
A thing, yeah.

49:35.285 --> 49:38.123
But, Ken,
you're almost my dad's age.

49:40.524 --> 49:42.459
I will fucking kill you,
nerd!

49:43.661 --> 49:44.996
What about
all the late-night shifts?

49:45.063 --> 49:46.597
What about the time we made out
on the train table?

49:46.664 --> 49:49.500
- You did what?
- We made out.

49:51.002 --> 49:52.937
It passes the time.

49:53.004 --> 49:54.706
But, Ken,
I don't really know you.

49:55.874 --> 49:57.641
I've never seen you
outside of the store.

49:57.709 --> 49:59.778
I mean, I've... I've never
even met your kids.

50:01.178 --> 50:03.148
Would we ever go out on a date?

50:03.213 --> 50:04.783
I don't think so, right?

50:05.950 --> 50:07.351
Pancakes.

50:11.856 --> 50:13.091
No?

50:25.070 --> 50:26.603
So that's it?

50:28.006 --> 50:31.341
You guys all think I'm some
sort of fucking loser, huh?

50:39.751 --> 50:40.819
I'm out of here.

50:43.287 --> 50:44.621
Let's go.

51:08.479 --> 51:10.380
What exactly
are we looking for?

51:10.447 --> 51:11.883
I'm fresh out of ideas.

51:17.254 --> 51:20.457
There's got to be a circuit
breaker or something in here.

51:38.209 --> 51:39.878
I can do you one better.

52:10.374 --> 52:12.110
Hey, what's the plan?

52:12.177 --> 52:13.510
Lou attacked you guys, right?

52:13.577 --> 52:15.379
Damn straight.
He showed Ken what's what.

52:15.445 --> 52:16.580
Right, which means the truck

52:16.647 --> 52:17.949
is still parked
in the loading dock.

52:18.016 --> 52:19.784
And the keys are still
in the truck. He told me.

52:19.851 --> 52:20.985
If we bust open those locks,

52:21.052 --> 52:22.386
we can get
into the bed of the truck.

52:22.452 --> 52:23.755
That's our way out of here.

52:23.822 --> 52:25.355
What happens when you
get into the truck bed?

52:25.422 --> 52:26.523
I figured there's got
to be a hatch

52:26.590 --> 52:28.092
to the front seat, right?

52:28.159 --> 52:30.295
Got it! Let's go.

52:30.360 --> 52:32.429
All right, team.

52:32.496 --> 52:34.232
Listen up.

52:34.299 --> 52:36.234
I've made a decision.

52:36.301 --> 52:39.336
As captain...

52:39.403 --> 52:40.705
I'm going down with the ship.

52:40.772 --> 52:42.339
- No!
- I'm staying behind.

52:42.406 --> 52:43.507
That's it.

52:43.574 --> 52:46.510
We had turkey together.

52:46.577 --> 52:47.879
And pretzels.

52:47.946 --> 52:51.182
Jonathan,
now is not the time, okay?

52:51.249 --> 52:53.350
Then when is my time, huh?

52:55.552 --> 52:58.622
Call me a fool,
but I love it here.

52:59.824 --> 53:01.658
This is my favorite place
in the whole world,

53:01.726 --> 53:05.029
and it would be an honor
to stay with the store

53:05.096 --> 53:06.965
in its final hours,

53:07.031 --> 53:09.834
as any good and strong
manager would.

53:13.403 --> 53:16.241
I told you they never die.

53:20.444 --> 53:23.047
Oh, this just got really bad.

53:47.805 --> 53:49.640
Go, get outta here!

53:58.683 --> 54:00.051
- Ken!
- Don't!

54:19.170 --> 54:22.907
Motherfucker! Ow! Ow!

54:34.185 --> 54:35.219
Ow!

54:36.453 --> 54:38.455
I think we're clear.

54:38.522 --> 54:39.891
Maybe they do die.

54:39.958 --> 54:41.125
- Ken.
- Are you okay?

54:41.192 --> 54:42.827
Wait, wait, wait.

54:42.894 --> 54:44.729
Stay back.
Do not come over here.

54:46.463 --> 54:47.899
Oh, my God.

54:47.966 --> 54:49.133
What happened?

54:49.200 --> 54:52.669
What does it look like?
Fucking new guy bit me.

54:54.638 --> 54:56.341
I can fix this.
We can fix this.

54:56.407 --> 54:57.709
No. No.

54:57.775 --> 54:59.543
You saw what happened
to Anita and Emmett.

54:59.609 --> 55:00.878
If they bite you,
you turn into one of them.

55:00.945 --> 55:02.512
No, no, no, no.
Don't say that.

55:02.579 --> 55:03.881
Well, that is the mythos,
right?

55:03.948 --> 55:06.150
Shut the fuck up, Jonathan!

55:06.217 --> 55:09.153
What happened to going down
with the ship, huh, Captain?

55:09.220 --> 55:10.788
I guess I changed my mind.

55:10.855 --> 55:12.656
We can cut the arm off.

55:12.724 --> 55:14.726
Let's lop it off.

55:14.792 --> 55:17.996
Guys, you already
took my dignity.

55:19.197 --> 55:20.530
Leave my arm.

55:22.300 --> 55:23.567
Get out of here.

55:23.633 --> 55:26.037
Put something in the door.
Don't let me out.

55:28.638 --> 55:30.008
Here.

55:31.409 --> 55:33.277
Ken, I'm... I'm sorry.

55:35.747 --> 55:37.547
Yeah, me too, kid.

56:05.476 --> 56:06.844
Fuck.

56:08.112 --> 56:11.149
Come on, man!
When are you gonna take me?

56:11.215 --> 56:13.518
Fuck!

56:13.583 --> 56:15.920
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

56:15.987 --> 56:19.223
<i>Want to go someplace new, new.</i>

56:19.290 --> 56:21.993
<i>Not my... not myself.</i>

56:22.060 --> 56:25.063
<i>Been a long...
been a long day, day, day.</i>

56:25.129 --> 56:27.799
<i>Been a long... been a long day.</i>

56:27.865 --> 56:29.367
Fuck off, Dour Dennis.

56:29.434 --> 56:31.635
<i>Yet others
are going through much worse.</i>

56:31.702 --> 56:33.171
Fuck off, man.

56:39.110 --> 56:40.945
You know what you're doing?

56:41.012 --> 56:43.748
No, but I figure
if I climb out of the hatch

56:43.815 --> 56:45.349
and get to the front seat,
it's our way out of here.

56:45.416 --> 56:47.085
Okay. Good plan.

56:47.151 --> 56:49.754
'Cause my Elks Lodge
is only about six miles away.

56:49.821 --> 56:51.355
Or the police station.

56:51.422 --> 56:53.491
The police are here
and they're monsters now.

56:53.558 --> 56:54.725
Now?

56:54.792 --> 56:57.829
Look,
I'll get us somewhere, okay?

56:57.895 --> 57:00.031
Brian, about a year ago,

57:00.098 --> 57:01.766
corporate sent
transportation...

57:01.833 --> 57:03.633
Hey, I hope you don't believe
what Ken said.

57:03.701 --> 57:05.103
It's not true.

57:06.270 --> 57:07.671
It's true.

57:07.738 --> 57:09.673
I don't know if he meant it,
but it's true.

57:11.342 --> 57:14.345
I made things uncomfortable by
bringing you into that fight.

57:15.680 --> 57:17.181
You're too good of a person.

57:17.248 --> 57:18.483
You remember
Christmas last year,

57:18.549 --> 57:19.851
we caught that woman stealing?

57:19.917 --> 57:21.252
I wanted to stop her. Y-y...

57:21.319 --> 57:24.288
She had kids.
She was stealing for them.

57:24.355 --> 57:25.456
What?

57:27.058 --> 57:29.060
What was I supposed to do,
call the cops

57:29.127 --> 57:31.429
so that she'd get arrested
and her kids would find out

57:31.496 --> 57:34.365
in the worst possible way
that Santa's not real?

57:34.432 --> 57:35.867
You let her do it?

57:35.933 --> 57:38.903
Marnie...
you did the right thing.

57:41.706 --> 57:43.040
Let's help Chris out.

58:03.728 --> 58:06.063
<i>Hey, how do you
feel today, feel today?</i>

58:06.130 --> 58:09.000
You know, I'm not doing
too good, Dour Dennis,

58:09.066 --> 58:10.434
but I appreciate the sentiment.

58:10.501 --> 58:13.371
<i>Just always
feel bad, bad, bad.</i>

58:13.437 --> 58:14.872
That's great.

58:14.939 --> 58:16.841
That's just fucking awesome.

58:21.779 --> 58:23.080
I'm good.

58:35.526 --> 58:37.128
Ah, fuck.

58:38.729 --> 58:40.431
God damn it, Brian!

58:46.170 --> 58:48.839
What are the odds
Chris fucks this up?

58:48.906 --> 58:50.875
You know, you are
a real boner killer,

58:50.942 --> 58:51.943
you know that?

58:59.483 --> 59:00.518
Bircher.

59:26.811 --> 59:29.681
<i>An emergency at-home order
has been put in place...</i>

59:31.649 --> 59:33.484
What do I do here?

59:33.551 --> 59:35.553
<i>Civilians are advised...</i>

59:35.620 --> 59:36.754
What is this?

59:36.821 --> 59:38.289
What are all these buttons?

59:38.356 --> 59:41.058
<i>I repeat: stay in your home.</i>

59:41.125 --> 59:44.195
<i>An emergency at-home order
has been put in place...</i>

59:44.262 --> 59:47.531
"You should have taken shop."
Shut the fuck up, Dad!

59:49.200 --> 59:50.702
<i>Civilians are advised
to avoid</i>

59:50.768 --> 59:52.603
<i>any and all retail areas.</i>

59:55.573 --> 59:57.208
<i>I can't do this at my house.</i>

59:57.275 --> 59:59.711
<i>My house is a mess,
mess, mess, mess.</i>

59:59.777 --> 1:00:01.445
Quiet, Dennis.
They'll hear us.

1:00:04.582 --> 1:00:06.150
Oh, fuck.

1:00:11.222 --> 1:00:12.423
<i>Get it together, together.</i>

1:00:12.490 --> 1:00:14.058
<i>It's not like my life
was my choice.</i>

1:00:14.125 --> 1:00:16.961
Hey!
This is for employees only!

1:00:19.030 --> 1:00:20.498
Come on, Dennis.

1:00:25.202 --> 1:00:26.937
<i>My wife left me, so I guess</i>

1:00:27.004 --> 1:00:29.407
<i>I can do
whatever the fuck I want.</i>

1:00:51.028 --> 1:00:52.897
What happened
to the plan, Chris?

1:00:52.963 --> 1:00:54.565
I can't drive this truck.

1:00:54.632 --> 1:00:56.735
That's what you get for not
taking shop class.

1:00:56.802 --> 1:00:58.602
Shh, shh!
The... they'll hear us.

1:00:58.669 --> 1:01:00.304
I saw Bircher outside.

1:01:00.371 --> 1:01:03.641
He was like Emmett.
He turned but maybe worse.

1:01:03.709 --> 1:01:05.543
I-I don't know.

1:01:05.609 --> 1:01:08.212
I don't think he saw me.

1:01:55.893 --> 1:01:57.294
Are you okay?

1:01:58.662 --> 1:02:00.131
Chris!

1:02:03.901 --> 1:02:05.603
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1:02:07.138 --> 1:02:08.840
Help!

1:02:12.943 --> 1:02:15.312
Aah!

1:02:15.379 --> 1:02:16.914
Shit!

1:02:16.981 --> 1:02:19.617
Jonathan, open the back door!

1:02:19.684 --> 1:02:21.152
We're safe in here, no?

1:02:21.218 --> 1:02:22.353
No! Obviously not.

1:02:22.420 --> 1:02:23.822
These things are fast
and strong.

1:02:23.889 --> 1:02:24.922
They'll rip this truck apart.

1:02:28.058 --> 1:02:29.660
Go! Go! Get the back!

1:02:29.728 --> 1:02:31.095
- Okay. Okay.
- GO! Go!

1:03:16.842 --> 1:03:18.442
What are we gonna do?

1:03:18.509 --> 1:03:22.246
Okay. Marnie, grab the back
of my sweater.

1:03:22.313 --> 1:03:24.448
Then Chris, Brian, you last.

1:03:24.515 --> 1:03:25.649
Me last?

1:03:25.717 --> 1:03:27.418
Well, unfortunately,
these things are hungry,

1:03:27.485 --> 1:03:30.020
and well, you're the slowest
and the juiciest.

1:03:46.337 --> 1:03:48.005
Are you crazy?
We can't see in there.

1:03:48.072 --> 1:03:49.507
You can't, maybe.

1:03:49.573 --> 1:03:52.042
I can walk through this whole
store with my eyes closed.

1:03:52.109 --> 1:03:54.178
Come on. Grab on. Let's move!

1:03:58.182 --> 1:03:59.684
I can't see anything.

1:03:59.751 --> 1:04:01.552
Shut the fuck up, juicy.

1:04:27.177 --> 1:04:28.479
This was a good call.

1:04:28.546 --> 1:04:30.314
Go high, you know.
That's what they say.

1:04:30.381 --> 1:04:32.918
- Who?
- I don't know, sports people?

1:04:32.984 --> 1:04:35.787
Marnie, where did the rest
of the shoppers go?

1:04:46.831 --> 1:04:48.365
<i>Hello, hello, hello.</i>

1:04:48.432 --> 1:04:51.435
<i>Maybe you could love me.
Maybe you could love me.</i>

1:05:04.248 --> 1:05:06.785
Guys, over here.

1:05:07.953 --> 1:05:09.553
Hey, uh,

1:05:09.620 --> 1:05:12.222
I'm totes sorry that I left you
on the sales floor.

1:05:12.289 --> 1:05:13.390
It's all right.
Forget about it.

1:05:13.457 --> 1:05:15.225
No, I've been a bitch.

1:05:15.292 --> 1:05:17.661
But I've totally taken control
since then.

1:05:17.729 --> 1:05:19.563
I totally helped with Ken.

1:05:19.630 --> 1:05:20.732
What?

1:05:22.132 --> 1:05:23.300
Oh, no!

1:05:23.367 --> 1:05:24.869
It's spreading too fast.

1:05:26.136 --> 1:05:29.273
No, no, no!
We got to put it out.

1:05:30.942 --> 1:05:32.811
No, no!

1:05:32.877 --> 1:05:35.279
I don't care how much smoke.
Back down the hatch!

1:05:42.119 --> 1:05:43.989
Oh, there they are.

1:05:44.055 --> 1:05:46.024
We don't have a way out.

1:05:46.091 --> 1:05:49.627
You know the worst thing
about holiday shoppers?

1:05:50.494 --> 1:05:53.263
They can never accept the fact
that the night is over.

1:05:54.099 --> 1:05:57.869
They have no idea what it takes
to work in retail.

1:05:57.936 --> 1:06:02.673
Year after year dealing with
hordes of unruly customers.

1:06:02.741 --> 1:06:04.709
You know what?

1:06:04.776 --> 1:06:08.780
My face hurts
because of all the fake smiles!

1:06:11.582 --> 1:06:14.719
My ears hurt from listening
to Air Supply

1:06:14.786 --> 1:06:17.922
50,000 times!

1:06:19.256 --> 1:06:24.161
Worst of all,
my fucking feet hurt!

1:06:24.228 --> 1:06:26.163
What is he doing?

1:06:26.230 --> 1:06:27.766
I think he's finally
had enough.

1:06:27.832 --> 1:06:31.903
It's right there
in the manager's handbook.

1:06:31.970 --> 1:06:36.206
The people that work for you
should be treated...

1:06:36.273 --> 1:06:37.709
like family.

1:06:37.776 --> 1:06:40.712
Well, these kids,
they're special to me.

1:06:41.913 --> 1:06:44.149
They're my family.

1:06:44.214 --> 1:06:45.850
Jonathan, what are you doing?

1:06:49.353 --> 1:06:51.923
So attention, shoppers,

1:06:51.990 --> 1:06:56.226
Black Friday is over!

1:06:56.293 --> 1:06:57.962
Whoo!

1:07:44.608 --> 1:07:46.477
Somebody say something.

1:07:49.313 --> 1:07:51.281
I bit Ken.

1:07:51.348 --> 1:07:52.382
You what?

1:07:56.888 --> 1:08:00.591
Ma'am, I have the right
to refuse service to anybody!

1:08:00.657 --> 1:08:03.061
And it doesn't matter appear
you're wearing a shirt

1:08:03.128 --> 1:08:05.964
or shoes, ma'am!

1:08:08.532 --> 1:08:10.667
I'll rip this place apart,
including you!

1:08:10.735 --> 1:08:12.771
Oh, get it together, dickless!

1:08:28.585 --> 1:08:31.421
I made a choice,
and I bit him.

1:08:33.057 --> 1:08:35.994
Ken Bates was no hero.

1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:38.328
He was a drunk and a creep.

1:08:39.898 --> 1:08:42.000
So I did us all a favor.

1:08:42.066 --> 1:08:45.136
You are a horrible person.

1:08:45.203 --> 1:08:47.272
You piece of shit.

1:08:47.337 --> 1:08:48.840
What the fuck?

1:08:48.907 --> 1:08:50.241
You didn't even think
about his daughters!

1:08:50.307 --> 1:08:51.475
Marnie! Marnie, please!

1:08:51.542 --> 1:08:52.911
These are more
than microaggressions!

1:08:52.977 --> 1:08:54.279
I fucking hate you!

1:08:54.344 --> 1:08:56.547
Guys, stop fighting, okay?
Not now.

1:08:56.613 --> 1:08:58.016
Grab some garland
and some lights.

1:08:58.082 --> 1:08:59.483
We can rappel off this thing.

1:09:43.328 --> 1:09:44.762
I'm okay!

1:09:46.130 --> 1:09:47.431
Yeah, me too!

1:09:47.497 --> 1:09:49.868
Oh, why are those things
so filthy?

1:09:51.401 --> 1:09:52.971
Guys, why is
the garbage so wet?

1:09:53.037 --> 1:09:55.039
Chris, you can do it.

1:09:56.207 --> 1:09:57.742
Three, two.

1:09:57.809 --> 1:09:58.675
Come on.

1:09:58.743 --> 1:10:00.345
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

1:10:00.410 --> 1:10:03.047
Oh! Five, four...

1:10:03.114 --> 1:10:05.216
Whoa!

1:10:05.283 --> 1:10:06.918
Oh, God.

1:10:06.985 --> 1:10:09.254
Are you okay?

1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:11.089
That thing just shook me off
the side of the roof,

1:10:11.155 --> 1:10:13.457
which is perfectly fine because
I was gonna jump anyway.

1:10:13.523 --> 1:10:14.424
It's, like, not even that bad
in here.

1:10:14.491 --> 1:10:16.493
Okay, Chris. Let's go.

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:18.997
Chris? What about me?

1:10:20.798 --> 1:10:24.335
You can stay here
with the rest of the trash.

1:10:24.401 --> 1:10:26.237
Ow!

1:10:26.304 --> 1:10:27.972
I'm sorry!

1:10:28.039 --> 1:10:31.075
He was kind of on
all of our shit, though, right?

1:10:31.142 --> 1:10:32.576
I mean, he said you were

1:10:32.643 --> 1:10:35.847
a waste of potential,
Chris, right?

1:10:35.914 --> 1:10:38.448
He said that you were
his girlfriend.

1:10:38.515 --> 1:10:40.450
Girl, bye!

1:10:40.517 --> 1:10:42.419
Dude was gonna lead us
to certain death

1:10:42.486 --> 1:10:44.621
'cause he was afraid
for his daughters.

1:10:45.690 --> 1:10:47.591
I did us all a favor!

1:10:49.827 --> 1:10:50.962
Hey!

1:11:00.004 --> 1:11:01.672
We have to make a run for it.

1:11:01.739 --> 1:11:03.908
Check every car,
and try to stay quiet.

1:11:09.914 --> 1:11:11.716
Any of those things
out here?

1:11:11.783 --> 1:11:14.686
I think they're
inside of that... thing.

1:11:14.752 --> 1:11:16.020
Looks like the coast is clear.

1:11:18.588 --> 1:11:20.224
This place is gonna blow.

1:11:20.291 --> 1:11:22.459
Try to find a car
that's unlocked.

1:11:22.526 --> 1:11:23.493
Jonathan would have had
a plan!

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:26.230
We need a plan!

1:11:26.297 --> 1:11:28.166
Oh, shit!

1:11:36.606 --> 1:11:38.343
Oh, Brian, God damn it!

1:11:42.512 --> 1:11:44.015
Let's go.

1:11:54.092 --> 1:11:56.660
What the fuck
is he doing now?

1:12:03.533 --> 1:12:06.004
Oh, my God.

1:12:08.306 --> 1:12:10.108
What is that thing?

1:12:18.349 --> 1:12:21.052
It's mom-fucking-Kong.

1:12:28.625 --> 1:12:29.894
What do we do now?

1:12:32.397 --> 1:12:34.032
It's all the shoppers.

1:12:40.104 --> 1:12:42.006
What if I can
get through to it?

1:12:46.310 --> 1:12:47.611
Are you crazy?

1:12:48.612 --> 1:12:50.748
It's a management thing.

1:12:50.815 --> 1:12:52.483
You'd never understand, Marnie.

1:12:58.256 --> 1:13:00.491
Hi there!

1:13:00.557 --> 1:13:02.960
My name is Brian.

1:13:03.027 --> 1:13:04.495
And I love toys!

1:13:13.504 --> 1:13:14.806
Okay.

1:13:14.872 --> 1:13:16.908
I know you're scared.

1:13:16.974 --> 1:13:20.378
I'm scared too. That's right.

1:13:20.445 --> 1:13:22.612
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:24.648
Come closer.

1:13:24.715 --> 1:13:26.851
You and I have been
through a lot, you know?

1:13:28.152 --> 1:13:31.055
You remember Black Friday 2016?

1:13:34.225 --> 1:13:37.728
Uh, I know
the shopper experience.

1:13:37.795 --> 1:13:40.465
I mean, as I always say,

1:13:40.531 --> 1:13:42.967
when in doubt, go shopping!

1:13:49.073 --> 1:13:52.210
You and me,
we have so many mems.

1:13:54.644 --> 1:13:56.646
If anyone knows,

1:13:56.714 --> 1:13:58.249
the customer's always r...

1:13:59.750 --> 1:14:01.352
Oh, my God.

1:14:03.855 --> 1:14:05.389
Shit. Shit.

1:14:05.456 --> 1:14:06.858
Ken's SUV is over there.

1:14:07.825 --> 1:14:09.659
He didn't give us the keys.

1:14:12.396 --> 1:14:15.166
And he didn't put
the fucking carts away!

1:14:15.233 --> 1:14:16.666
Knock, knock!

1:14:20.738 --> 1:14:23.774
You're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"

1:14:23.841 --> 1:14:25.977
- Now a bad time for a dad joke?
- Ken!

1:14:28.212 --> 1:14:29.847
We didn't think
you'd make it.

1:14:29.914 --> 1:14:31.349
Did you see Brian
get just fucking...

1:14:31.415 --> 1:14:32.517
Like a paper football.

1:14:36.687 --> 1:14:39.423
Ken, I'm sorry.

1:14:39.490 --> 1:14:42.527
I'm sorry too.
I was an asshole.

1:14:42.593 --> 1:14:43.828
You're too good
for a toy store.

1:14:43.895 --> 1:14:45.229
You both are.

1:14:45.296 --> 1:14:46.864
That's why
we need to get out of here.

1:14:46.931 --> 1:14:48.699
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go, go!

1:15:08.019 --> 1:15:09.320
What the hell
are we gonna do?

1:15:09.387 --> 1:15:11.822
If we run,
that thing's gonna pick us off.

1:15:12.924 --> 1:15:14.091
I have an idea.

1:15:19.897 --> 1:15:21.966
Chris,
please don't play hero.

1:15:22.033 --> 1:15:24.402
Can you distract that thing?

1:15:24.468 --> 1:15:25.703
I'ma hold you down.

1:15:25.770 --> 1:15:28.372
- Don't.
- No, Jonathan was right.

1:15:28.439 --> 1:15:30.007
It's fucking Thanksgiving.

1:15:30.074 --> 1:15:31.409
I'm deciding right here
right now,

1:15:31.475 --> 1:15:32.843
you guys are my family.

1:15:32.910 --> 1:15:34.111
- So can you do it?
- Yeah.

1:15:35.646 --> 1:15:37.582
No, I'll do it.
He's got kids.

1:15:37.648 --> 1:15:39.784
No, no, you won't. Hey! Hey!

1:15:39.850 --> 1:15:41.619
Whoa! Hey, right here!

1:15:41.687 --> 1:15:44.255
Hey, right here! Hey!

1:15:48.926 --> 1:15:51.028
I don't like you.

1:15:51.095 --> 1:15:53.164
I don't have to help you.

1:15:53.231 --> 1:15:55.566
I got your discount right here.

1:15:55.633 --> 1:15:57.802
Look at this.
Whoa, whoa, hey!

1:15:57.868 --> 1:15:59.971
Hey, check this out.
Check it out, huh?

1:16:00.037 --> 1:16:03.140
You see that? Hey! Hey!

1:16:03.207 --> 1:16:05.776
Right here, you big bitch!
Right here!

1:16:07.778 --> 1:16:10.181
I don't need to help you.

1:16:10.248 --> 1:16:13.584
I got your discount right here!
Look at this.

1:16:13.651 --> 1:16:16.220
Look here!

1:16:16.287 --> 1:16:18.122
Hey! Hey!

1:16:18.189 --> 1:16:20.057
Yo!

1:16:32.169 --> 1:16:33.739
Oh, no!

1:16:33.804 --> 1:16:36.574
Oh, no, Chris. No.

1:17:07.538 --> 1:17:09.307
Come on!

1:17:26.424 --> 1:17:28.092
Yes! Bang!

1:17:56.087 --> 1:17:57.855
I think I just pissed it off.

1:18:12.970 --> 1:18:14.572
Come on! I think we can
make it to my car.

1:18:14.638 --> 1:18:15.741
Let's go! Come on!

1:18:15.807 --> 1:18:16.974
Come on!

1:18:39.865 --> 1:18:41.665
Just a thing?

1:18:41.733 --> 1:18:43.300
Just a thing.

1:18:43.367 --> 1:18:44.435
Let's go.

1:18:48.439 --> 1:18:49.907
Leah texted.

1:18:49.974 --> 1:18:52.042
My daughters are okay.

1:18:52.109 --> 1:18:54.478
They set up safe havens
for people.

1:18:55.212 --> 1:18:57.214
Sounds good to me.
Let's do it.

1:18:58.349 --> 1:19:00.651
We gotta make a detour first.

1:19:00.719 --> 1:19:02.019
For what?

1:19:03.487 --> 1:19:04.689
For pancakes.

1:19:07.726 --> 1:19:08.959
Let's go!

1:19:11.362 --> 1:19:12.798
<i>Well...</i>

1:19:12.864 --> 1:19:14.932
<i>well... well... well,</i>

1:19:14.999 --> 1:19:17.201
<i>it's been a long day,
day, day.</i>

1:19:17.268 --> 1:19:20.438
<i>And this is surely the end.</i>
