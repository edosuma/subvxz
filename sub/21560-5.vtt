so Toshiaki had to open
the place up for a plumber,

that was my only chance.

with the heart on the back.

would drag the chair...

All right.

I'm heading home, but you're
on my way to the rink,

so if you want me to --

I've got my arms around it...

24:35.742 --> 24:38.177
I can't see it anymore.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.581
So we're talking
about the future again.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.017
I should call her back.

24:45.051 --> 24:49.088
Is this what you saw
10 years ago?

24:49.121 --> 24:50.790
Because it's not
what I saw for myself

24:50.823 --> 24:52.792

in my garage.

24:52.825 --> 24:56.162
That's the point.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.531
It was never about
where it ended up.

24:58.565 --> 25:03.035
It was...
about how it felt.

25:03.069 --> 25:06.873
When I saw it...

25:06.906 --> 25:11.744
I knew how it would feel
to build something with you.

what's next.

to have you here.

about my sex life

on you like this.

in the middle of something.

if we talk later?

but a sec.

No.

Look.

26:42.769 --> 26:44.904
I know what we said,

26:44.937 --> 26:47.774
and I wouldn't ask, Cam,
if there's any other way.
No!

26:47.807 --> 26:50.777
No. No. Bos, we said
no patches, no updates.

26:50.810 --> 26:51.978
It was a one-time deal.

No, it's nothing that grand.

the tech specs for the patent.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.017

26:58.050 --> 26:59.218
You're telling me he wrote
half the work,

26:59.251 --> 27:00.720
and he can't explain it
to you?

27:00.753 --> 27:01.954
Well, he could use
some guidance, huh?

on the phone.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.824

would never come back to me.

have to say something

are you talking about?
