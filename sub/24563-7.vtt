00:01.653 --> 00:02.785
[male narrator]
Previously on "Ninjago.."

00:02.872 --> 00:03.786
- Let's go, little Wu.
- Ha-ha.

00:03.873 --> 00:04.961
Harumi is the quiet one.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.310
We must warn Lloyd.

00:06.397 --> 00:07.920
The Quiet One
wouldn't let it pass.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.010
[screaming]

00:10.097 --> 00:12.925
[Lloyd]
We made it to the temple.

00:14.405 --> 00:17.017
[theme music]

00:32.641 --> 00:34.121
[engine revving]

00:35.774 --> 00:38.429
[laughing]

00:41.824 --> 00:44.957
[male narrator]
Episode 81, "Game of Masks."

00:54.054 --> 00:56.969
At last, the sword of fortune.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.190
Not so fast, Ninja.

01:00.277 --> 01:03.585
I am the shadow thief
and I'll never let you have it.

01:03.672 --> 01:07.197
Then, we battle
because Ninja never quit.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.677
Ye-ah-ah!

01:09.678 --> 01:12.594
[rumbling]

01:13.682 --> 01:14.639
What was that?

01:16.554 --> 01:19.775
Snake of a rather unusual size
is attacking Ninjago.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.821
If you're watching this now,
please, leave the city at once.

01:22.908 --> 01:23.996
[roaring]

01:27.609 --> 01:29.915
- We need to leave, now!
- But..

01:31.613 --> 01:34.485
[dramatic music]

01:35.530 --> 01:36.487
[beeps]

01:36.574 --> 01:38.359
[all screaming]

01:38.446 --> 01:39.838
We'll take the stairway.

01:42.145 --> 01:43.668
Where are the stairs?

01:45.235 --> 01:46.758
- Ah!
- There's no room.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.543
Take the next one.

01:48.630 --> 01:49.848
[grunts]

01:49.935 --> 01:52.721
- Please, take her.
- No.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.810
I wanna stay with you.

01:54.897 --> 01:57.900
Please. I wanna stay. Mamma!

01:57.987 --> 02:00.424
We'll, we'll see you
when we get down.

02:00.511 --> 02:01.599
I promise.

02:03.645 --> 02:05.516
[rumbling]

02:10.913 --> 02:12.697
Hmph! So much for the Ninjas.

02:12.784 --> 02:13.785
[sighs]

02:13.872 --> 02:15.265
Did you see that thing?

02:15.352 --> 02:18.268
Lord Garmadon single handedly
destroyed it.

02:18.355 --> 02:19.835
He's the real hero.

02:19.922 --> 02:22.142
Brave little girl you are.

02:22.229 --> 02:24.318
Where are your parents, child?

02:27.495 --> 02:29.149
Do you have a name?

02:31.238 --> 02:33.849
Well, aren't you the quiet one.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.899
[gushing]

02:42.858 --> 02:44.164
The Oni Temple.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.261
[grunting]

02:59.048 --> 03:00.005
[squeals]

03:08.275 --> 03:09.841
[grunts]

03:09.928 --> 03:10.929
[sighs]

03:12.017 --> 03:13.932
If the last mask is here

03:14.019 --> 03:15.456
it won't come easily.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.415
Trust me. I've had my share
of deadly tombs.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.764
Follow my every step.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.026
[grunts]

03:23.551 --> 03:25.248
[grunts]

03:25.335 --> 03:27.511
[rumbling]

03:27.598 --> 03:28.730
Lloyd!

03:28.817 --> 03:30.558
[grunts]

03:30.645 --> 03:34.475
Okay. Don't touch anything
with that symbol on it.

03:34.562 --> 03:37.434
[intense music]

03:41.090 --> 03:42.396
[rumbling]

03:42.483 --> 03:43.875
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.181
I didn't touch anything.

03:45.268 --> 03:46.400
Harumi, the exit!

03:46.487 --> 03:48.445
[rumbling]

03:48.532 --> 03:50.055
No. No, no, no!

03:52.710 --> 03:53.972
[sighs]

03:54.059 --> 03:55.496
Guess, there's
no turning back now.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.721
[ship whirring]

04:05.070 --> 04:07.769
[all laughing]

04:10.554 --> 04:11.642
[laughing]
Yeah!

04:11.729 --> 04:14.254
If you harm one hair
on his head..

04:14.341 --> 04:15.385
[Killow]
You'll what?

04:16.125 --> 04:17.387
Where is he?

04:17.474 --> 04:19.433
Where's the Green Ninja?

04:19.520 --> 04:21.478
Hah, like we'll ever tell you.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.654
Ah, Cole,
you don't argue with a man

04:23.741 --> 04:24.916
whose navel is that close.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.744
Mr. E found them.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.485
Good eye, Mr. E.

04:28.572 --> 04:32.097
The Oni Temple is just
15 miles north of here.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.230
Set a course for the Quiet One.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.884
You don't have to call her that.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.364
We know it's Harumi.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.322
[all laughing]

04:41.324 --> 04:43.544
Do you guys have any idea
what you're doing?

04:43.631 --> 04:45.850
She's planning on
resurrecting Garmadon.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.983
Lord Garmadon!

04:48.070 --> 04:50.290
I'm gonna guess you never
had the chance to met him.

04:50.377 --> 04:53.684
No, but we look forward to it.

04:53.771 --> 04:57.297
In our experience when the bad
guys to unearth an ancient evil

04:57.384 --> 04:59.168
it never ends well for the them.

04:59.255 --> 05:02.345
Yeah. Just ask Pythor,
Master Chen, Morro

05:02.432 --> 05:04.173
or even Garmadon himself.

05:04.260 --> 05:08.351
Hmm, then it's a good thing
the Quiet One isn't a bad guy

05:08.438 --> 05:10.310
but a bad girl.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.313
[all laughing]

05:14.488 --> 05:16.011
Careful, Ninja.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.448
I wouldn't wanna
upset the child.

05:18.535 --> 05:19.884
[giggles]

05:19.971 --> 05:22.583
Let's just hope Lloyd discovers
Harumi's secret

05:22.670 --> 05:24.367
before her help arrives.

05:27.936 --> 05:30.504
[Harumi screams]

05:30.591 --> 05:31.896
Almost there.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.420
[grunts]

05:33.507 --> 05:34.464
[both panting]

05:34.551 --> 05:36.597
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.381
But it's hard to see.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.087
What is this place?

05:51.002 --> 05:53.048
[instrumental music]

05:59.010 --> 06:01.273
- 'It's their story.'
- Who?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.753
The Oni.

06:02.840 --> 06:03.754
See there.

06:05.408 --> 06:06.366
It's amazing.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.675
They must have built
this place.

06:11.762 --> 06:15.113
When the first Spinjitzu master
escaped their world

06:15.200 --> 06:17.289
'they must've come
looking for him.'

06:17.377 --> 06:20.118
- Who?
- The Oni.

06:20.205 --> 06:23.774
He was the key to winning their
eternal war with the dragons.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.342
Ninjago was a new world
to them.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.344
The Oni must have holed up here.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.172
Explains all the traps.

06:30.259 --> 06:31.913
Must not have wanted
any visitors.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.050
[sighing]
This is a dead end.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.531
Look. The symbol from earlier.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.273
Maybe you can break through
one of these walls.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.970
If the symbol is on here

06:46.057 --> 06:47.929
this one must be booby trapped.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.365
Hmph!

06:49.452 --> 06:50.410
Worth a shot.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.590
What's wrong?

06:56.677 --> 06:58.940
If the Oni wanted
to protect the mask

06:59.027 --> 07:00.855
they would know anyone
who got this far

07:00.942 --> 07:02.422
would avoid the markings.

07:02.509 --> 07:03.684
What do you mean?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.163
This has to be the way.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.601
But you see the water.

07:07.688 --> 07:08.950
If you break the wrong wall

07:09.037 --> 07:11.300
this whole room will flood.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.781
Hm. Then I sure
hope I'm right.

07:13.868 --> 07:14.782
[grunts]

07:16.305 --> 07:17.437
[grunts]

07:17.524 --> 07:19.177
[clattering]

07:24.139 --> 07:25.096
[chuckles]

07:25.183 --> 07:26.141
[breathing heavily]

07:26.228 --> 07:27.185
Let's go.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.237
[gasps]

07:38.022 --> 07:39.415
[Harumi]
'The Mask of Hatred.'

07:40.938 --> 07:41.852
[sighs]

07:52.515 --> 07:53.473
[grunting]

07:55.736 --> 07:58.608
[intense music]

08:06.877 --> 08:07.791
[groans]

08:11.534 --> 08:13.797
Only someone with Oni blood
can take the mask.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.504
[dramatic music]

08:39.693 --> 08:40.998
Can I?

08:41.085 --> 08:42.826
Can I see it?

08:42.913 --> 08:44.306
I just wanna see it.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.917
How did you know?

08:47.004 --> 08:48.745
I-it's an Oni temple.

08:48.832 --> 08:51.139
It's safe to assume
only an Oni could take it.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.575
No.

08:52.662 --> 08:55.404
How could you know
that I was part Oni?

08:55.491 --> 08:58.407
You're related to the first
Spinjitzu master.

08:58.494 --> 08:59.800
He was an Oni.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.585
I never told you that.

09:02.672 --> 09:05.501
Jay and I were alone
when Mistake told us the story.

09:05.588 --> 09:06.807
You were never there.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.548
Then I must have
heard it from Jay.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.814
I don't wanna believe it.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.992
You're the Quiet One?

09:18.079 --> 09:19.776
How could you say that?

09:22.953 --> 09:24.607
It all makes sense now.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.261
The greatest villain
is the one

09:26.348 --> 09:28.785
you never knew was there
in the first place.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.700
- You said that.
- Oh, yes.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.572
I'm the criminal
mastermind.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.138
How could I
have done this?

09:34.225 --> 09:36.837
Do you realize
how silly you're sounding?

09:36.924 --> 09:38.969
I, I love you.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.409
- Stay back.
- Lloyd.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.977
[Lloyd]
You only wanted me to
get the mask you couldn't find.

09:47.064 --> 09:49.501
I didn't need you
to find the mask.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.025
It would've already been mine

09:51.112 --> 09:53.810
had your idiot friends
not stolen Wu from us.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.683
The baby is Master Wu?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.120
Oh, that's right.

09:59.207 --> 10:00.904
You didn't know.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.298
I knew to keep you close.

10:03.385 --> 10:05.561
Not everything goes to plan.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.869
- Give me the mask.
- No.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.653
I can't let you bring
my father back.

10:10.740 --> 10:11.872
Not like that.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.395
Well, then,
if you won't give to me..

10:13.482 --> 10:14.526
[grunting]

10:14.614 --> 10:15.963
[groans]

10:16.050 --> 10:17.921
Then, I will take it!

10:18.922 --> 10:21.751
[dramatic music]

10:23.579 --> 10:25.537
[grunting]

10:26.800 --> 10:27.714
[grunts]

10:31.587 --> 10:32.632
Why?

10:32.719 --> 10:35.286
I never asked to be princess.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.072
Just as I never asked
to be an orphan.

10:38.159 --> 10:41.292
But you gifted me that.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.338
- How did I do that?
- The Great Devourer.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.687
It was too strong

10:44.774 --> 10:47.168
too big for you
and your friends.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.083
[chuckles]

10:49.170 --> 10:51.868
Lloyd, you're aren't
so naive to think

10:51.955 --> 10:54.088
no one got hurt that day,
did you?

10:54.175 --> 10:55.959
[Lloyd grunts]

10:56.046 --> 10:59.833
It wasn't until the all mighty
Lord Garmadon saved the day.

10:59.920 --> 11:03.314
But he couldn't save my family.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.490
It was too late.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.144
I died that day too.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.801
Give me one reason not to
say goodbye to it, right now.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.237
I'll give you two.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.284
You want to see
your father again

11:16.371 --> 11:17.851
and you love me.

11:19.156 --> 11:22.594
Ah, your emotions.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.074
You can't get rid of them.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.686
It's hard to think, isn't it?

11:26.773 --> 11:29.645
[Harumi]
I felt those feelings too.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.952
We truly are kindred spirits.

11:32.039 --> 11:33.214
[screams]

11:33.301 --> 11:34.955
[both grunting]

11:37.305 --> 11:38.393
[both grunting]

11:38.480 --> 11:39.655
[clanking]

11:39.742 --> 11:40.700
[whirring]

11:40.787 --> 11:41.831
[Harumi groans]

11:41.918 --> 11:43.224
[grunts]

11:45.182 --> 11:46.575
[laughing]

11:46.662 --> 11:48.055
You have put the bug
on the ship.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.621
You caused the crash.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.058
A calculated risk.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.755
Your friends were so close
to the truth

11:52.842 --> 11:54.670
I couldn't let them stop me.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.977
Feeding the poor,
acting scared?

11:57.064 --> 11:58.369
It was all an act?

11:58.456 --> 12:01.329
Ah, yes, the damsel in distress.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.461
You Ninja really aren't
from another time.

12:03.548 --> 12:04.854
The emperor and the empress?

12:04.941 --> 12:07.422
They were never my parents.

12:07.509 --> 12:11.382
To protect Ninjago,
I had to repress those feelings.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.385
I had to wear a mask
until the time came

12:14.472 --> 12:16.692
for me to take control.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.781
I had to be smarter, stronger.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.044
You were never
protecting Ninjago.
