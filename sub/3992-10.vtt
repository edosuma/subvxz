WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:04.259
- Previously, on Hannibal.
- Admit what you are.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.189
- You still refuse to see
the monster growmg lnSIde you.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.798
- I want exclusive rights
to your story.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.503
- It's all yours, Freddie.
What is the heir to the Verger

00:12.540 --> 00:15.532
meatpacking dynasty
doing at my door?

00:15.580 --> 00:18.777
- We_have some
very srmllar Issues.
I tried to kill my brother.

00:18.810 --> 00:21.779
- I assume he had it coming.
- They're looking for you.

00:21.820 --> 00:24.186
It's important you do
exactly what I say.

00:28.420 --> 00:31.423
(dogs barking and whining)

01:06.600 --> 01:09.592
(dogs barking)

03:01.310 --> 03:03.699
- I'd say
this makes us even.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.970
I sent_someone
to kIll you...

03:09.020 --> 03:11.215
you sent someone
to kill me.

03:15.890 --> 03:17.881
Even-steven.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.221
- Consider it an act
of reCIprOCIty.

03:24.030 --> 03:28.239
- Polite society normally places
such a taboo on taking a life.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.602
- Without death,
we'd be at a loss.

03:32.610 --> 03:36.341
It's the prospect of death
that drives us to greatness.

03:36.380 --> 03:39.372
Did you kill him
with your hands?

03:41.750 --> 03:43.342
- It was...

03:50.490 --> 03:52.526
...intimate.

03:54.530 --> 03:56.998
- It deserves intimacy.

03:57.030 --> 04:00.238
You were Randall Tier's
final enemy.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.295
Don't go inside, Will.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.409
You'll want to retreat.

04:40.710 --> 04:42.678
You'll want it

04:42.710 --> 04:47.545
as the glint of the rail
tempts us when we hear
the approaching train.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.548
Stay with me.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.457
- Where else
would I go?

04:52.490 --> 04:56.085
- You have everywhere to go.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.055
You should be
quite pleased.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.955
Iam.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.991
- Of course you are.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.563
- When you killed Randall,

05:11.610 --> 05:13.999
did you fantasize
you were killing me?

05:27.490 --> 05:29.583
Most of what we do,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.497
most of what we believe,
is motivated by death.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.639
- I've never felt as alive
as I did when I was killing him.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.909
- Then you owe
Randall Tier a debt.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.546
How will you
repay him?

06:49.240 --> 06:52.732
***

07:17.600 --> 07:20.990
- The killer chose
not to dispose of the body,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.008
but to display it.

07:23.040 --> 07:27.079
- A jarring reminder
of the informality of death.

07:27.110 --> 07:29.078
- Randall Tier was

07:29.110 --> 07:33.649
denied the respectful end
that he himself denied others.

07:35.650 --> 07:37.618
- This is a humiliation,

07:37.650 --> 07:41.017
a final indignity.
- He isn't mocking him.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.483
This isn't disdain.

07:43.530 --> 07:47.751
He's... commemorating him.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.153
- This killer has no fear

07:49.200 --> 07:52.260
for the consequences
of what he's done.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.791
- No guilt.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.938
Hello again.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.961
(steady heartbeat)

08:35.780 --> 08:37.270
- Come closer.

08:37.310 --> 08:41.542
I want to see you.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.151
Can you see you?

08:52.090 --> 08:53.694
- Clearer and clearer.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.828
You forced me
to kill you.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.577
- I didn't force you
to enjoy it.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.818
YOU made me a monument.

09:13.850 --> 09:16.318
- You're welcome.

09:16.350 --> 09:21.686
- The monument is not to me;
it's to you.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.780
- I gave you what you want.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.822
This is who you are.

09:27.860 --> 09:34.129
What you feel finally matches
the reality of what I see.

09:34.170 --> 09:36.661
- This is my becoming.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.736
And it's yours.

09:44.310 --> 09:46.972
- This is my design.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.141
He knew his killer.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.886
There's a...

09:53.920 --> 09:55.888
familiarity here.

09:55.920 --> 09:59.128
Someone who met him,

09:59.160 --> 10:01.128
understood him.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.288
Someone like him.

10:04.330 --> 10:06.639
Different pathology,

10:06.670 --> 10:09.298
same instinct.

10:09.340 --> 10:12.002
- His killer empathized
with him?

10:12.040 --> 10:14.406
- Don't mistake understanding
for empathy, Jack.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.000
No, if there's
anything, it's...

10:17.050 --> 10:19.006
it's enw.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.268
- Enw?

10:21.320 --> 10:23.709
- Ra_ndall Tier came
Into hIs own

10:23.750 --> 10:27.288
much easier than
whoever killed him.

10:27.320 --> 10:31.780
- This was a fledgling killer.
He's never killed before,

10:31.830 --> 10:34.355
not like this.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.420
- Not like this, no.

10:39.470 --> 10:43.406
This is the nightmare that
followed him out of his dreams.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.171
(typing)

10:53.220 --> 10:55.347
(knocking on door)

10:55.380 --> 10:58.679
(knocking on door)

11:07.860 --> 11:10.465
- (Freddie): I've upped the ante
on my publishing deal.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.798
There's been movie interest.

11:12.840 --> 11:17.937
Hollywood is a fine place
for the obnoxious and wealthy.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.074
- You're not wealthy, Freddie.

11:20.110 --> 11:22.806
- Oh, I will be.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.808
No, I am a pariah
among journalists

11:25.850 --> 11:27.818
because I took
a different faith,

11:27.850 --> 11:29.841
but I am putting
that faith in you.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.818
Let's talk

11:33.860 --> 11:36.852
about the
Chesapeake Ripper.

11:36.890 --> 11:39.256
Frederick Chilton.
Who knew?

11:39.290 --> 11:41.258
- Who knew?

11:41.300 --> 11:45.088
- No one did. No one would,
not even you.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.394
You were so certain
the Chesapeake Ripper

11:47.440 --> 11:49.806
was Hannibal Lecter,
you tried to kill him.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.206
- You neglected
to say "allegedly".

11:52.240 --> 11:54.401
- No, I didn't.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.469
Hannibal Lecter is_
your psychiatrist again.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.148
What's up with that?

12:00.180 --> 12:03.843
- I was wrong about him;
that's what's up with that.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.983
- Maybe you were.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.981
Maybe you weren't.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.820
- Dr. Chilton was
the Chesapeake Ripper.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.362
- The Chesapeake Ripper
had surgical skills
Dr. Chilton did not.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.198
- They had the same profile.
- Dr. Chilton was

12:24.240 --> 12:27.038
a woeful surgeon -
dangerous, even.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.844
I've been chatting with some
of his old medical school chums.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.919
They say he fled to psychiatry
to avoid embarrassment.

12:41.220 --> 12:46.328
- My story with the Chesapeake
Ripper already has an ending,
Freddie.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.560
- Mine doesn't.

12:52.600 --> 12:56.809
Do you really think Dr. Chilton
killed Abigail Hobbs?

12:58.610 --> 13:01.431
I don't.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.404
Even if I let
this story go,

13:04.450 --> 13:07.044
I will never
let that go.

13:12.350 --> 13:14.352
- Trust me, Freddie...

13:17.090 --> 13:19.081
...neither will I.

13:27.100 --> 13:30.604
- You know you will
have to kill him, Margot.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.108
You've known it for years.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.515
- I may have missed
my opportunity.
- Do you know

13:40.550 --> 13:43.110
why you failed
to murder him, Margot?

13:45.250 --> 13:47.150
- Poor planning.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.090
- You failed to murder
your brother because
you still love him.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.990
In love, you take leave
of your senses, but in hatred,

13:59.030 --> 14:02.033
you must be present
to calculate your actions.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.634
Allow yourself
to hate him.

14:06.670 --> 14:10.242
Do you think Mason will just
give you what you want?

14:10.280 --> 14:14.216
You'll be begging him
for the rest of your life.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.241
Did begging help
when he tore you?

14:18.650 --> 14:22.381
Same thing as
taking his chocolate
and letting him have his way.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.223
- I'm lucky
I didn't kill him.

14:27.260 --> 14:30.127
Papa's will was very clear.

14:30.170 --> 14:33.537
Upon the passing
of his beloved son Mason,

14:33.570 --> 14:36.437
in the absence
of a legitimate male heir,

14:36.470 --> 14:41.134
the sole beneficiary shall be
the Southern Baptist Convention.

14:43.080 --> 14:46.072
- Even in death, Mason would
take everything from you.

14:48.350 --> 14:52.047
One of the most powerful forces
that shapes us as human beings

14:52.090 --> 14:54.217
is the desire
to leave a legacy.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.659
What legacy would you
leave behind?

14:58.690 --> 15:02.592
- I don't get a legacy.

15:02.630 --> 15:06.566
- Unless you make one.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.495
- Have a good ride?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.499
- Here, put him away.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.371
What do you want?

15:56.380 --> 15:59.178
- What do I want?
What do I want?

15:59.220 --> 16:01.711
What do I want?
What do I want?

16:01.760 --> 16:07.494
I... want... to...

16:07.530 --> 16:09.589
share something

16:09.630 --> 16:11.598
with you.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.393
This is

16:13.440 --> 16:16.091
Pavlov. Say hello, Pavlov.
(pig squealing)

16:16.140 --> 16:17.505
Say hello.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.771
Margot, say hello
to Pavlov.

16:20.810 --> 16:23.108
- Hi, pretty.

16:23.150 --> 16:27.246
- After Papa died,
I had a Christmas epiphany.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.785
I've seen exotic pigs
from all over the world.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.788
What would happen

16:33.820 --> 16:35.651
if I brought together

16:35.690 --> 16:39.421
the best of all
that I had seen?

16:41.430 --> 16:43.125
- You built a maze.

16:43.170 --> 16:46.219
I shudder to think.

16:46.270 --> 16:48.397
- I feel like Stradivarius.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.568
Our father was a pioneer

16:51.610 --> 16:56.104
in livestock production.
I think he'd be...

16:56.140 --> 16:58.142
he'd be proud
of my efforts.

17:01.450 --> 17:04.419
A pig is not like other animals.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.418
There is a spark
of intelligence,

17:06.450 --> 17:08.554
a terrible practicality
in pigs.

17:08.590 --> 17:12.822
(pigs snorting)

17:12.860 --> 17:15.351
- Well, you do have
an unparalleled understanding

17:15.400 --> 17:18.563
of piggishness.
(He laughs.)

17:18.600 --> 17:24.209
- Your mouth gets rough
when you're scared, Margot.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.333
Tough as a livery pony

17:26.370 --> 17:28.736
who is resentful
of the bit.

17:28.780 --> 17:31.840
The structure is designed

17:31.880 --> 17:36.146
to excite and_
antagonize the pigs.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.842
It's taken a while to find

17:38.890 --> 17:41.711
the perfect mix.
Any pig will eat a dead man,

17:41.760 --> 17:44.228
but to get him
to eat a live one,

17:44.260 --> 17:48.822
some... education is required.

17:48.860 --> 17:53.297
Carlo is experienced
in this field.

17:53.340 --> 17:57.401
He actually fed a man to pigs
in Tuscany 20 years ago.

17:59.670 --> 18:02.377
- That's one of my suits.

18:02.410 --> 18:05.208
- I'll buy you a new one.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.219
We... stuff the clothes
with meat,

18:08.250 --> 18:11.640
scent it with
human smells, and play

18:11.690 --> 18:14.579
the screams every time
they are fed.

18:14.620 --> 18:18.624
Come the real thing,
we won't need the recording.

18:18.660 --> 18:21.754
(woman screaming)

18:21.800 --> 18:25.224
(gate opening)

18:25.270 --> 18:28.694
(pigs snorting excitedly)

18:30.710 --> 18:32.632
It's not just about

18:32.670 --> 18:36.231
making Papa proud.
It's about us.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.272
It's about... family.

18:42.820 --> 18:45.641
I want you to be proud
of me too, Margot.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.251
You're all I have.

18:51.290 --> 18:55.329
And, uh...
I'm all you have.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.292
(pigs snorting excitedly)

19:08.440 --> 19:10.408
And this little piggy went

19:10.450 --> 19:16.138
"eeeeeeeeee-eeeeeee-eeee,"
all the way home.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.779
(theremin tone)

19:31.400 --> 19:33.766
- It sounds like I'm killing it.
- You are killing it.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.893
Don't kill it.

19:35.940 --> 19:39.239
A theremin is an instrument
that can create equISIte mu5Ic

19:39.270 --> 19:42.376
without ever needing
to be touched, but...

19:42.410 --> 19:44.378
it requires
the rare gift

19:44.410 --> 19:46.901
of perfect pitch
to play properly.

19:46.950 --> 19:48.941
(theremin tone)

19:51.450 --> 19:53.452
(knocking on door)

20:09.300 --> 20:11.609
- I've come to replenish
your stores.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.969
- Feel the vibration
moving through you.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.215
Feel it here.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.919
And here.

20:33.460 --> 20:37.362
- It's like composing
in thin air.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.494
- Thin air is
a musmran's canvas.

20:45.810 --> 20:48.631
- What happened
to your window?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.648
- A stag got lost
in the storm,

20:50.680 --> 20:52.545
came through there.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.677
Got a _few scratches
getting him out.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.519
- Are you scarred?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.687
- Probably more
than I know.

21:09.530 --> 21:12.294
- I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.332
- I don't have the right parts
for your proclivities, Margot.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.837
(theramin tone)

21:24.850 --> 21:26.408
- It's a very

21:26.450 --> 21:28.418
psychological instrument.
(both chuckling)

21:28.450 --> 21:31.840
- Yes, we work
with people the same way.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.912
Never touching...

21:36.960 --> 21:40.919
- Yeah.
- ...but guiding them from

21:40.960 --> 21:44.794
dissonance toward composition.

21:57.980 --> 22:00.540
- (Alana): But people
are not instruments.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.440
Whatever it is
you're playing, Hannibal,

22:05.490 --> 22:09.119
you have to listen
very carefully

22:09.160 --> 22:10.980
to what you're creating.

22:12.990 --> 22:15.424
- I am listening.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.325
I'm listening to you.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.569
You and I went so long
in our friendship

22:25.610 --> 22:29.728
without ever touching, yet
I always felt attuned to you.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.615
- Who did this to you?

22:38.750 --> 22:40.718
- My brother.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.354
Who shot you?

22:47.830 --> 22:49.559
- A friend.

25:44.840 --> 25:49.072
- I've always admired teachers,
molding impressionable
young minds.

25:49.110 --> 25:51.874
But you can only learn
so much and live.

25:51.910 --> 25:54.572
- No one likes
a know-it-all, Freddie.

25:54.620 --> 25:58.579
- Hannibal Lecter
taught you when you were
an impressionable young mind.

25:58.620 --> 26:01.259
- Your book's about Will Graham,
it's not about me.

26:01.290 --> 26:03.258
- Were you sleeping
with Hannibal Lecter

26:03.290 --> 26:07.181
when you were his student,
or is that a recent development?

26:07.230 --> 26:10.119
Oh, you are sleeping with him.
I was just guessing.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.128
Figured you had to be sleeping
with one of them.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.138
Maybe that's why
you can't see it.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.092
- See what?

26:16.140 --> 26:18.267
- Will Graham was right about.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.301
Hannibal Lecter...

26:20.340 --> 26:23.002
and I was right
about Will Graham.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.201
- I'm not having this

26:25.250 --> 26:28.242
or any other conversation
with you, Freddie.

26:28.280 --> 26:31.215
- Hannibal Lecter had
four patients die

26:31.250 --> 26:33.650
while under his care.
Three former patients die

26:33.690 --> 26:35.749
after his care, and then
there's Will Graham.

26:35.790 --> 26:39.624
All that fuss about Dr. Lecter.
Will even tried to kill him.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.197
And now they're back
in therapy together,

26:42.230 --> 26:44.369
and another
former patient is dead.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.221
- Will understands that
Hannibal Lecter can help him.

26:47.270 --> 26:50.330
- Maybe what Will
understands is,

26:50.370 --> 26:52.861
if you can't beat
Hannibal Lecter,

26:52.910 --> 26:54.901
join him.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.372
(pigs snorting)

27:33.150 --> 27:35.243
- Dr. Lecter.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.918
Mason Verger.

27:36.950 --> 27:39.043
So very nice to meet you.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.217
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.683
- I'm prone
to old-world politeness.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.686
Would have seemed rude
to say no.

27:45.730 --> 27:48.756
- Since I'm paying for Margot's
therapy, I thought I should

27:48.800 --> 27:51.360
at the very least
meet her psychiatrist.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.368
- I enjoy putting a face
to the name.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.095
(pigs snorting)

27:55.140 --> 27:58.200
Your swine are exceptional.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.869
Never seen pigs like these.

28:01.910 --> 28:05.107
- They're a special breed.

28:05.150 --> 28:07.141
Product of many years,
many litters.

28:09.150 --> 28:12.085
- What's your ground note?

28:12.120 --> 28:13.485
- We started with

28:13.520 --> 28:17.957
Giant Forest pigs,
6 teats, 38 chromosomes,

28:17.990 --> 28:19.719
a resourceful feeder,

28:19.760 --> 28:22.354
and an opportunistic omnivore.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.368
- Just like man.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.197
- You must know pigs

28:26.230 --> 28:28.198
as well as you
know people.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.960
- I do know pigs.
- Papa would've loved you.

28:32.010 --> 28:36.106
He could feel the face of a hog
and tell by the bone structure
its genetic makeup.

28:36.140 --> 28:39.109
Breeding was very important
to my father.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.846
Margot really pissed him off
with all her...

28:41.880 --> 28:45.316
button stitching.
No breeding there.

28:47.150 --> 28:50.859
Do you have a sister,
Dr. Lecter?

28:50.890 --> 28:52.380
- I had a sister.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.898
- Then you understand
my need to protect

28:54.930 --> 28:59.993
Margot - mostly from herself.
She's pathological.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.897
I'm sure she's told you
horrible things that I've done.

29:02.940 --> 29:07.263
- I can't tell you
what Margot's confessed to me.

29:07.310 --> 29:10.871
Fortunately for you,
I can't tell anyone.

29:12.910 --> 29:16.516
(laughing)

29:16.550 --> 29:19.781
(Mason clears his throat.)
- Got me.

29:22.060 --> 29:25.188
- Even the worst of us need
someone to talk to, Mason.

29:25.230 --> 29:28.051
Have you ever considered
therapy for yourself?

29:30.060 --> 29:31.925
- Maybe I should.

29:33.970 --> 29:37.428
Can I have Carlo
slaughter you a hog?

29:37.470 --> 29:41.076
A token of my appreciation
for all that you do for Margot.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.445
- Please.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.916
But I_ must insist _
on selecting my own pig.

29:47.950 --> 29:49.941
Always do.

29:52.220 --> 29:55.212
***
(Chopin "Raindrop" prelude)

30:02.100 --> 30:05.092
Brined and roasted...

30:05.130 --> 30:07.189
whole suckling pig.

30:11.110 --> 30:14.102
A gift from a friend.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.349
- A friend of yours,
not a friend of the pig's.

30:19.380 --> 30:21.519
- There are those
who raise livestock

30:21.550 --> 30:25.042
and have a genuine
affection for them.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.513
The farmer who hand rears
lambs loves them

30:27.550 --> 30:32.055
and sends them to slaughter.

30:32.090 --> 30:35.548
- They love and
kill what they love.
- And eat what they love.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.461
It's a paradox.

30:40.500 --> 30:44.960
- Freddie Lounds thinks
the two of you are a paradox.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.501
She sees something
no one else sees.

30:47.540 --> 30:50.270
- What's that?

30:53.150 --> 30:56.449
- That neither of you is
the killer she's writing about,

30:56.480 --> 31:00.109
but together,
you might be.

31:00.150 --> 31:03.517
- Freddie Lounds must consider
you a bland InterVIew subject

31:03.560 --> 31:06.529
if she's already resorted
to fiction.

31:10.330 --> 31:12.491
- She won't be
fenced in by something

31:12.530 --> 31:16.136
as malleable as the truth.
Freddie has no boundaries.

31:16.170 --> 31:18.536
- Someone with no boundaries
is a psychopath.

31:18.570 --> 31:20.435
Or a journalist.

31:26.410 --> 31:29.914
- Freddie isn't the only one
without boundaries.

31:33.090 --> 31:35.479
Your relationship doesn't
seem to know many.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.253
Patient and therapist,

31:39.290 --> 31:41.554
friend and enemy.

31:41.600 --> 31:46.321
- Crossing boundaries is
different than violating them.

31:51.370 --> 31:53.975
- Boundaries will always be
subject to negotiation.

31:58.750 --> 32:02.447
It's just hard to know
where you are with each other.

32:02.480 --> 32:06.041
- We know where we are
with each other.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.479
Shouldn't that be enough?

32:15.130 --> 32:17.121
- Better the devil you know.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.701
(dogs barking)

33:29.070 --> 33:32.062
(wind chimes)

35:49.740 --> 35:51.947
- There really is a very good
explanation for all this.

35:51.980 --> 35:54.949
- I don't want to hear it.

35:54.980 --> 35:57.710
- Not just
a little bit curious?

35:57.750 --> 35:59.547
- Get away from the door.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.411
- I can't let you
go, Freddie.

36:05.890 --> 36:08.450
Not till you've heard
what I have to say.

36:13.570 --> 36:15.390
I know you're scared.

36:15.440 --> 36:18.307
You only have
to be scared

36:18.340 --> 36:21.400
a moment longer.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.204
Give me the gun.

36:30.380 --> 36:31.916
(She screams.)

36:34.760 --> 36:36.853
Ah!

36:36.890 --> 36:38.619
- Ahh! Ah! N0!

37:01.650 --> 37:04.414
(Freddie screaming)

37:10.520 --> 37:13.921
(Freddie screaming)

37:13.960 --> 37:16.497
(Screaming cuts out.)

37:16.530 --> 37:19.363
- (Jack): Freddie Lounds left me
that message three hours ago.

37:19.400 --> 37:20.924
Her cell signal is dead now.

37:20.970 --> 37:23.495
Last call was traced _
to the nearest phone tower In,

37:23.540 --> 37:26.361
uh, Wolf Trap, Virginia.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.038
We have her on security cameras
at a gas station,

37:29.080 --> 37:31.036
filling up her car -

37:31.080 --> 37:33.401
six miles from your farm.

37:37.020 --> 37:38.988
- Freddie was supposed
to interview me.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.783
She never showed up.

37:40.820 --> 37:44.426
- Why are you granting
interviews to Freddie Lounds?

37:44.460 --> 37:46.724
- I owed her one.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.524
- Surely, Freddie Lounds
has more enemies than Will.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.290
- Not in Wolf Trap, Virginia.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.889
I live in the
middle of nowhere, Jack;
if someone wanted to take her,

37:57.940 --> 38:00.966
it's... not
a bad place to do it.

38:06.950 --> 38:09.441
And I provide the ingredients.

38:11.450 --> 38:13.680
You tell me what we should
do with them.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.711
- What's the meat?

38:18.460 --> 38:19.825
- What do you think?

38:28.030 --> 38:29.634
- Veal?

38:31.640 --> 38:34.370
(smelling)
Pork, perhaps?

38:36.780 --> 38:39.977
- She was a slim
and delicate pig.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.718
- I'll make you
lomo saltado.

38:44.750 --> 38:48.584
We will make it together.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.919
You slice the ginger.

***
(Mahler: Symphony #5, Adagietto)

39:43.510 --> 39:47.002
_- The meat has
an Interesting flavour.

39:47.050 --> 39:48.779
It's brazing.

39:50.780 --> 39:52.145
Notes of citrus.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.818
- My palate isn't
as refined as yours.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.151
it‘s more flavourful
for animals to be stress-free

40:04.200 --> 40:06.395
prior to slaughter.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.834
This animal tastes
frightened.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.576
- What does "frightened"
taste like?

40:20.580 --> 40:23.549
- It's acidic.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.146
- The meat is bitter

40:27.190 --> 40:30.819
about being dead.

40:38.600 --> 40:41.569
- This meat is not pork.

40:48.610 --> 40:50.601
- It's long pig.

41:09.630 --> 41:12.963
You can't reduce me to...

41:13.000 --> 41:15.889
a set of influences.

41:15.940 --> 41:18.602
I'm not the product
of anything.

41:18.640 --> 41:22.076
I've given up
good and evil

41:22.110 --> 41:24.101
for behaviourism.

41:30.550 --> 41:32.814
- Then you can't say
that I'm evil.

41:34.820 --> 41:36.811
- You're destructive.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.718
Same thing.

41:40.760 --> 41:44.594
- Evil is
just destructive?

41:44.630 --> 41:47.861
Storms are evil,
if it's that simple.

41:47.900 --> 41:52.030
And we have fire,
and then there's hail.

41:52.070 --> 41:55.574
Underwriters lump it all
under "Acts of God".

41:59.650 --> 42:02.539
Is this meat
an act of God, Will?
