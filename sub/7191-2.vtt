18:53.215 --> 18:55.217
- Why would he
ring the doorbell?

18:55.300 --> 18:56.385
It's his house.

18:56.802 --> 18:57.553
- Right.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.887
Right.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.889
It's probably just--

19:00.973 --> 19:02.474
Maddie and Ursula?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.855
Did you know
Emma invited them?

19:09.273 --> 19:11.441
- [excited]
It's Francisco's house!

19:12.651 --> 19:14.403
- Are you even allowed
to be here?

19:14.486 --> 19:15.445
- Yes!

19:15.529 --> 19:17.030
Of course I am.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.615
That, that
restraining order,

19:18.699 --> 19:21.952
that was just,
it was just...

19:22.035 --> 19:23.161
for 90 days.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.371
Where's
Francisco?

19:24.454 --> 19:25.414
- Not here.

19:25.497 --> 19:26.373
- Oh.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.916
- Where's Emma?
Is she late?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.419
Is there
even cake?

19:30.502 --> 19:32.296
- Everything's okay.
I'm making the cake.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.047
- Oh, well, Francisky Winky

19:34.131 --> 19:36.758
likes
vanilla anchovy sponge cake.

19:37.634 --> 19:38.510
Can you make that?

19:39.344 --> 19:41.013
- Where's
Proxy?

19:41.096 --> 19:42.431
- He's not invited.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.099
- Why wouldn't
you invite him?

19:44.182 --> 19:46.435
- Um, because it's Mr. Alonso's
birthday party

19:46.518 --> 19:47.603
and not my house.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.854
Plus, we didn't invite
Katie or--

19:48.937 --> 19:49.980
- Ha, we're here.

19:50.063 --> 19:50.272
- Surprise!

19:52.190 --> 19:53.150
[grunting]
- Not yet.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.151
I'll let you know when.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.485
- Why are they here?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.029
- Andi, help!
The mixer won't work!

19:57.112 --> 19:58.572
- I invited them,
of course.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.866
[girls giggling]

20:00.949 --> 20:03.201
I'll text Proxy and
invite them right now.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.787
And you better hope he gets here
on time for the surprise.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.496
- Surprise!
[straining]

20:06.580 --> 20:08.290
- Not yet,
not yet.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.374
- Emma didn't say you
could invite anyone else.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.378
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on here?

20:13.462 --> 20:14.504
- A-ha.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.131
Works better when
you plug it in.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.300
[mixer whirring suddenly]

20:21.970 --> 20:24.681
- Finally,
we can go home.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.309
- No, wait.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.645
"Emma and Jax, finish
the SOD before going home."

20:29.728 --> 20:31.939
- What? No!

20:32.022 --> 20:33.273
I'm already late!

20:33.357 --> 20:34.358
- We have to.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.234
- No way--I'm not doing
any more.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.904
I'm not missing
my dad's party for this.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.906
- Where are you going?

20:40.989 --> 20:42.324
- To find a way out
of here.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.325
- There's no point.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.576
You're wasting
your time.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.787
Agamemnon has
to let us go.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.664
- Where do you sleep?

20:48.747 --> 20:49.831
- The barracks.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.415
- Uh-uh.
I'm leaving.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.754
- Emma.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.172
This is a bad idea.

20:57.255 --> 20:59.675
If Agamemnon catches us, we
can kiss our powers good-bye.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.760
- You can stay.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.137
But I can't do this
to my dad.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.514
- Emma,
don't do it!

21:06.473 --> 21:08.016
Listen to me!

21:08.100 --> 21:09.101
Emma!

21:10.936 --> 21:11.436
[frustrated grunt]

21:19.611 --> 21:20.404
- Where are we?

21:22.698 --> 21:24.074
Is this
the cafeteria?

21:24.157 --> 21:25.367
I was trying
to tell you

21:25.450 --> 21:29.454
that the emergency exit
leads to Iridium High.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.415
- Great.
I'm closer to home.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.541
Now let's go
before Agamemnon--

21:32.624 --> 21:34.710
- Before Agamemnon what?

21:34.793 --> 21:37.045
Gets a snack?

21:37.129 --> 21:41.383
Or finds the two rogue
rebels running about?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.094
Boom.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.262
Got you.
