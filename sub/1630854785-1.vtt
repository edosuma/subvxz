14:38.600 --> 14:40.190
Oh.

14:40.390 --> 14:41.360
[nervous chuckle]

14:41.560 --> 14:44.240
I gave the bible
to Rosa from Paraguay,

14:44.440 --> 14:46.410
who understood immediately

14:46.610 --> 14:49.910
why a person would take
the bible out of the room.

14:50.110 --> 14:51.910
And she... she gave me soap.

14:52.110 --> 14:54.290
And she knew just enough English

14:54.490 --> 14:56.520
to tell me that
I'd go straight to hell.

14:57.270 --> 14:59.880
- Listen to me. Listen.
- [splutters] Okay.

15:00.080 --> 15:01.800
A lifetime of decent behavior

15:02.000 --> 15:04.170
while other people were
having more fun than us

15:04.370 --> 15:06.970
and ending up here together
because we're lonely

15:07.170 --> 15:09.100
couldn't possibly
get us into hell.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.180
Are you sure?

15:10.380 --> 15:12.520
Because it's a big deal.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.560
I'm sure.

15:13.760 --> 15:14.850
- You are?
- Yes.

15:15.050 --> 15:16.690
[smacks lips, sighs]

15:16.890 --> 15:18.860
- Wanna watch TV?
- Oh, yes.

15:19.060 --> 15:20.230
- Okay.
- [both laugh]

15:20.430 --> 15:22.500
Oh, there.
It's right here. [laughs]

15:24.590 --> 15:25.900
- There.
- [turns TV on]

15:26.100 --> 15:28.740
- [porno music plays]
- [woman screams in ecstasy]

15:28.940 --> 15:30.470
Do you wanna change the channel?

15:31.260 --> 15:32.340
No.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.910
That's how it's done?

15:36.110 --> 15:38.520
Well, those are professionals.

15:39.930 --> 15:41.460
- Do you like that?
- No, I don't.

15:41.660 --> 15:42.960
- I don't.
- Because--

15:43.160 --> 15:44.670
- [TV clicks off]
- Whew!

15:44.870 --> 15:46.010
Wha...

15:46.210 --> 15:48.220
I mean, how do I even
possibly belong in hell?

15:48.420 --> 15:50.180
I don't even know
what was, like,

15:50.380 --> 15:52.140
happening with those people.

15:52.340 --> 15:54.350
What? [nervous laugh]

15:54.550 --> 15:55.850
You're adorable.

15:56.050 --> 15:57.980
Has anyone ever told you that?
You wanna take a walk?

15:58.180 --> 15:58.940
Yeah!

15:59.140 --> 16:02.070
[traffic noise]

16:02.270 --> 16:05.280
Howard, we are
going on four months.

16:05.480 --> 16:08.460
This is just not the way
you do this after four months.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.630
What do you think is right?

16:12.180 --> 16:13.280
Feelings?

16:13.480 --> 16:15.700
You wanna talk
about your feelings?

16:15.900 --> 16:18.160
- No, that window closed.
- When?

16:18.360 --> 16:20.210
As soon as I said it,
I knew I wasn't gonna do it.

16:20.410 --> 16:21.710
Well, this wasn't about
feelings anyway.

16:21.910 --> 16:23.040
You wanna know
what this was about?

16:23.240 --> 16:24.630
- No.
- This is about

16:24.830 --> 16:26.840
leaving the lives we have

16:27.040 --> 16:30.300
to spend time
in the lives we deserve.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.890
Like an elegant hotel.

16:32.090 --> 16:33.470
Dinner with the right wine.

16:33.670 --> 16:36.770
Room service dessert that
you can't make at home, huh?

16:36.970 --> 16:38.560
And what about the boom-boom?

16:38.760 --> 16:41.900
Oh, I want to be wanted
in these surroundings.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.730
I want adventure.

16:43.930 --> 16:45.820
- Those are my feelings.
- Yeah.

16:46.020 --> 16:46.960
[sniffs]

16:47.920 --> 16:49.590
There's one feeling that I have.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.800
You are some kind of woman.

16:55.430 --> 16:57.010
Oh, well...

16:57.550 --> 16:58.930
thank you for that.

16:59.510 --> 17:00.890
How come?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.060
This is...

17:05.140 --> 17:07.360
the first time I've done
something like this.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.590
And it's incredible to me

17:10.790 --> 17:13.050
that you've been able
to turn a one-night stand

17:13.250 --> 17:16.030
into something that's taken
four months to get out of.

17:16.990 --> 17:19.330
[gentle instrumental music]

17:55.110 --> 17:57.450
It was the bridal
bouquet, Allen.

17:58.490 --> 17:59.990
And she threw it to me.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.600
Michelle--

18:02.800 --> 18:05.120
I was gonna jump in the air
like it was Swan Lake.

18:06.580 --> 18:09.360
And I was coming down
with those flowers.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.540
And you were gonna kiss me.

18:12.630 --> 18:14.710
And I was gonna kiss you.

18:15.670 --> 18:16.870
But the kind of kiss
that let you know

18:17.070 --> 18:18.930
you'd be loved
for the rest of your life.

18:21.390 --> 18:24.100
And your whole head
was gonna go, "Whoa!"

18:25.180 --> 18:26.540
And hold onto me way longer

18:26.740 --> 18:28.730
than appropriate
at somebody else's wedding.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.880
And me and my best friend
in the white dress

18:32.080 --> 18:33.590
could keep thinking
our beautiful thoughts

18:33.790 --> 18:35.050
about our children growing up

18:35.250 --> 18:36.940
and being best friends.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.780
Our kids.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.680
Who we're never gonna have now

18:42.880 --> 18:44.950
because I'm not gonna
let you touch me anymore.

18:45.660 --> 18:48.500
[gentle instrumental music
continues]

19:00.890 --> 19:02.970
I want a more elegant exit.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.580
I want lies that you enjoyed
your time in this place

19:07.780 --> 19:08.890
because of me.

19:10.810 --> 19:11.960
Okay.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.970
I am... grateful

19:14.170 --> 19:16.550
that you would think that I know

19:16.750 --> 19:18.690
how to be more sophisticated

19:19.280 --> 19:20.850
in this awkward moment.

19:21.050 --> 19:24.850
And I hope that you will not be
so terribly angry that I'm not.

19:25.050 --> 19:27.270
Oh, but I am terribly angry.

19:27.470 --> 19:28.770
No reason for me to be here
if you're angry.

19:28.970 --> 19:30.690
Not the kind of anger
that rises up quickly

19:30.890 --> 19:33.540
and then goes away.
That's anger for other people.

19:35.250 --> 19:38.090
Okay. What kind of anger
do you have?

19:38.760 --> 19:40.530
Well, the more I look at you,

19:40.730 --> 19:44.080
it's a... quiet,
sustaining anger

19:44.280 --> 19:47.290
that consumes me
on a cellular level,

19:47.490 --> 19:50.310
and motivates me
to start my new project.

19:51.100 --> 19:52.710
Oh, well, okay. Good.

19:52.910 --> 19:55.090
Uh, surely that has
nothing to do with me.

19:55.290 --> 19:58.260
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go right out this door.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.970
I mean, you find it so amusing,
this idea of pushing a button

20:01.170 --> 20:03.100
and then something
just suddenly doesn't exist.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.720
Well, this existed.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.390
I exist.

20:06.590 --> 20:07.980
And you hurt me.

20:08.180 --> 20:09.940
[laughing]
I don't think I hurt you.

20:10.140 --> 20:11.520
Well, I'm gonna make it
like you hurt me.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.730
So you walk out that door,

20:13.930 --> 20:15.650
I'm gonna hurt you back.

20:15.850 --> 20:18.450
I really don't think I hurt you.

20:18.650 --> 20:21.420
I'm gonna figure out
how to kill you

20:21.880 --> 20:23.240
and get away with it.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.120
[soft, upbeat music plays]

20:26.320 --> 20:27.710
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

20:27.910 --> 20:29.580
Because, while I've never
done anything like that,

20:29.780 --> 20:32.600
and I'm smart, I think
I can get away with it.

20:34.190 --> 20:35.880
Then does it matter
if I stay or go?

20:36.080 --> 20:37.880
Oh, you are free to leave.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.890
Just understand that if you
never wanna see me again,

20:41.090 --> 20:43.300
then you better make sure that
you never see me again.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.220
Because if you do,
then that's the day

20:45.420 --> 20:47.280
I'm gonna push that button...

20:48.740 --> 20:51.580
and you will cease to exist.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.580
I think that's fair.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.990
I always knew my life would be
a collection of hideous moments

21:00.190 --> 21:02.070
ever since my mother told me
I would never be a ballerina.

21:02.270 --> 21:04.530
Which was difficult for both of
us, but I knew she was right.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.180
[sighs]

21:08.390 --> 21:10.000
Do you want me to help you?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.970
You don't touch me.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.820
[grunting]

21:22.940 --> 21:24.510
I accept that when God made me

21:24.710 --> 21:28.640
he did not dip into his
reservoir of physical grace.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.620
So, I've always tried to make up
for that with quirk!

21:33.160 --> 21:37.440
Which has somehow saved me from
horrible moments of public shame

21:37.640 --> 21:38.420
until tonight.

21:39.670 --> 21:41.240
You did it, Allen.

21:41.440 --> 21:45.010
You are responsible for the most
humiliating moment of my life.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.700
All this time, I was sure
it would be me, but no.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.140
It was you.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.830
I don't even want to be
in the same room with you

21:54.030 --> 21:55.140
where there's a bed.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.720
I'll tell you what else God did.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.510
He put night between the days

22:06.710 --> 22:08.470
so tomorrow could be a new one.

22:08.670 --> 22:10.520
So, all you have to do is

22:10.720 --> 22:14.190
accept my very sincere apology,

22:14.390 --> 22:15.730
and then this day can be over.

22:15.930 --> 22:17.370
And we can go to sleep.

22:21.210 --> 22:23.670
And so can the people
in the surrounding apartments.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.240
Oh, am I being a little loud?

22:26.440 --> 22:27.950
[male neighbor]
Yes, you are, darling.

22:28.150 --> 22:30.590
I'm sorry!
We're having a fight here.

22:32.180 --> 22:34.080
It was a reflex action.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.880
I saw the flowers.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.730
I reached out
and I grabbed them.

22:38.770 --> 22:40.670
You climbed on a table,

22:40.870 --> 22:42.980
and threw yourself
across the room.

22:43.900 --> 22:45.430
It was the most awful moment

22:45.630 --> 22:47.930
in the whole history of women
being stuck with you idiots.

22:48.130 --> 22:49.260
Because I caught
the bridal bouquet?

22:49.460 --> 22:50.240
No!

22:51.530 --> 22:53.530
Because you knew
it meant something to me,

22:54.290 --> 22:56.080
and you left it in the street.

22:59.210 --> 23:00.960
[male neighbor] You bastard.

23:04.340 --> 23:05.450
[chatter]

23:05.650 --> 23:07.410
[siren in distance]

23:07.610 --> 23:09.280
[Grace] Well, this is nice.

23:09.480 --> 23:10.830
Could we get killed out here?

23:11.030 --> 23:12.160
[Sam] It's okay.

23:12.360 --> 23:15.460
Seriously, do you think
this could be a mistake?

23:15.660 --> 23:18.500
No, this is wonderful.
I'll tell you what's a mistake.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.350
Everything I've ever done.

23:21.730 --> 23:24.920
You know how many girlfriends I
took for a walk in high school?

23:25.120 --> 23:26.680
[chuckling] No.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.090
One. One girlfriend.

23:29.290 --> 23:30.140
- Oh?
- Martha.

23:30.340 --> 23:32.930
She had a pink angora sweater.

23:33.130 --> 23:34.430
Which was the end of me.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.850
The leaves would blow
off the trees and stick to it.

23:37.050 --> 23:39.190
And one time,
she let me pull them off.

23:39.390 --> 23:41.980
Oh, yeah.
We're diabolical like that.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.570
- That got me through winter...
- Uh-huh.

23:44.770 --> 23:46.450
...when I asked her
to go sledding with me

23:46.650 --> 23:48.110
but I didn't bring my sled.

23:48.310 --> 23:49.320
So there was only one sled.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.120
So we had to
lie on top of each other.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.290
Oh! Yeah.

23:53.490 --> 23:55.120
You guys are less clever.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.620
But, you know, we appreciate it

23:56.820 --> 23:58.810
when you include us
in your plans.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.920
We were soaked from the snow.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.690
- Uh-huh.
- We went back to her house.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.420
And she took off
all her clothes.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.300
Right in front of me.
And there she was, a naked girl.

24:09.500 --> 24:10.970
Smiling at me.

24:11.170 --> 24:13.430
Like I would know what
to do with a naked girl.

24:13.630 --> 24:14.820
Did you?

24:21.620 --> 24:23.520
Is there something
wrong with me?

24:23.720 --> 24:25.320
Because, in this time
we're spending together,

24:25.520 --> 24:27.240
that's all you really need
to figure out, right?

24:27.440 --> 24:29.250
So, is there something
wrong with me?

24:30.090 --> 24:32.300
Are you holding out
for a ballerina?

24:33.430 --> 24:35.550
You've always been
a ballerina to me.

24:36.470 --> 24:37.960
Oh, boy.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.750
If we weren't having
this argument right now,

24:39.950 --> 24:41.930
I'd be kissing
everything you got.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.400
Here, you can have two.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.760
Don't you think
our relationship works?

24:51.960 --> 24:54.510
Why would we change
something that works?

24:54.710 --> 24:57.140
Less people are getting
married, you know.

24:57.340 --> 24:58.780
What if they're onto something?

25:00.660 --> 25:02.020
I have a different thing.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.080
Okay. What do you got?

25:04.830 --> 25:05.980
I've got, this thing works

25:06.180 --> 25:07.650
because I thought
it was going somewhere.

25:07.850 --> 25:09.570
Now that I know you think we've
arrived at where we're going,

25:09.770 --> 25:11.070
it's gonna start
not working so good.

25:11.270 --> 25:13.660
I love what we are.

25:13.860 --> 25:16.700
I'm happy with what we are
together. Is that no good?

25:16.900 --> 25:18.410
You decide what I am to you.

25:18.610 --> 25:19.930
I love you right now.

25:20.510 --> 25:21.620
And now.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.270
You don't even get
to say that anymore.

25:28.190 --> 25:30.130
How do you know you're not
gonna meet someone better?

25:30.330 --> 25:32.740
I'm telling you
I'll stop looking forever.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.220
How do you know that now?

25:35.420 --> 25:37.030
Are you a scared man?

25:38.200 --> 25:39.220
No.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.330
Because I don't want
a scared man.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.060
You're just lucky
what you did tonight

25:43.260 --> 25:44.960
doesn't stop me
from knowing who you really are.

25:45.830 --> 25:47.420
I am lucky, but...

25:48.420 --> 25:50.420
I don't get
to touch you anymore.

25:51.170 --> 25:53.590
Is that all you want? Here.

26:01.930 --> 26:03.390
This is my heart.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.190
This is my mind.

26:08.020 --> 26:11.440
All this can be yours if you
call within the next 24 hours.

26:12.190 --> 26:13.820
Operators are standing by.

26:14.650 --> 26:18.280
[soft, upbeat instrumental
music playing]

26:41.760 --> 26:44.710
You've got one day to tell me
we're on the road to somewhere.

26:44.910 --> 26:46.880
Not that we're here
and this is it.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.810
because this is not it.

26:53.110 --> 26:55.150
Anything besides a "yes"
is a "no."

27:00.160 --> 27:01.890
[door closes]

27:02.090 --> 27:04.770
[faint siren]

27:04.970 --> 27:07.940
So, Martha and I had
more romantic evenings,

27:08.140 --> 27:10.420
and what was awkward became...

27:12.040 --> 27:15.700
Well... [chuckles]
I became proficient.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.410
I just thought,

27:17.610 --> 27:19.660
what good is it
having this skill

27:19.860 --> 27:22.410
but Martha's going to be
the only one who knows it.

27:22.610 --> 27:25.000
I just wanted
to show someone else

27:25.200 --> 27:26.580
what I could do.

27:26.780 --> 27:28.670
And word would get
around the halls,

27:28.870 --> 27:32.090
and everyone would know
what Martha and I had.

27:32.290 --> 27:33.880
That's... That's all I wanted.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.630
- That was my plan. [chuckles]
- Yeah?

27:36.830 --> 27:38.140
What do you think?

27:38.340 --> 27:40.800
I don't know. I mean,
how did it work out for you?

27:41.000 --> 27:43.020
I took another girl to bed.

27:43.220 --> 27:46.390
Which was easy, because
I belonged to somebody else.

27:46.590 --> 27:48.230
And you got caught.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.360
Martha walked in on us.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.070
I, um...

27:52.270 --> 27:53.730
I looked up at her and I said,

27:53.930 --> 27:56.780
"Hi. I'm doing this for us."

27:56.980 --> 27:58.860
I never saw such a look

27:59.060 --> 28:02.410
of complete disappointment.

28:02.610 --> 28:05.140
Except on my wife's face
all the time.

28:06.720 --> 28:08.500
Martha never talked to me again.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.460
But you want to know what?

28:10.660 --> 28:12.380
When I was with the other girl,

28:12.580 --> 28:15.560
in my head, it was
always Martha anyway.

28:16.150 --> 28:18.260
You never heard from her again?

28:18.460 --> 28:21.930
One time. I got a letter
with no return address.

28:22.130 --> 28:25.770
It said, "Sam, I'm married now
and I love my husband."

28:25.970 --> 28:28.850
"But when I love him the most,
he reminds me of you."

28:29.050 --> 28:31.360
Oh. That's devastating.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.770
Oh! I was thrilled.

28:33.970 --> 28:37.860
Because, as hard as I try,
I can't satisfy my wife.

28:38.060 --> 28:40.320
But here, without trying,
without even being there,

28:40.520 --> 28:43.340
someone was thinking
nice things about me.

28:44.010 --> 28:46.220
I think nice things
about you, Sam.

28:47.680 --> 28:51.080
You know, no matter what tricks
you picked up in high school,

28:51.280 --> 28:54.710
I don't know how I could have
had a better time than tonight.

28:54.910 --> 28:57.690
[soft, upbeat

29:00.320 --> 29:02.570

29:24.300 --> 29:26.120
Can you have my car brought up,
please? Thank you.

Our doorman will be happy
to assist you, ma'am.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.920
Ma'am? Ooh.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.330
Look at you.

29:33.530 --> 29:35.480
Aren't you lovely?

29:36.350 --> 29:40.020
And this hair, oh! Good for you.

29:40.940 --> 29:42.110
Look at me.

29:44.030 --> 29:45.990
Come on, you looked at me
before. Look at me now.

Oh, honey.

Well, you know,

33:46.870 --> 33:48.590
we just have to decide

33:48.790 --> 33:52.050
whether we get married
or break up.

33:52.250 --> 33:53.840
Honey!

33:54.040 --> 33:56.430
You can't think about
spending your life with someone

33:56.630 --> 33:58.770
or never seeing them again
at the same time.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.430
Well, sure you can.

34:00.630 --> 34:02.080
Those are the choices.

That make sense to you?

34:05.890 --> 34:06.920
What?

34:09.500 --> 34:13.880
Well, it doesn't have to make
sense to be what you've got.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.240
- Okay?
- Why is it always me?

34:18.440 --> 34:20.500
- Because it's always you.
- Oh.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.910
You okay? Why aren't you
in your apartment?

35:00.110 --> 35:01.450
I was standing around
talking to the wall.

35:01.650 --> 35:03.210
So, I figured it was best
I wasn't there.

35:03.410 --> 35:04.830
- [Sam chuckles]
- I still have a room here?

35:05.030 --> 35:07.250
[Monica]
Of course you do, baby!

35:07.450 --> 35:08.540
And you are always
welcome to it,

35:08.740 --> 35:10.130
especially if that girl
that you're with

35:10.330 --> 35:12.610
has failed to live up
to my expectations.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.260
- Mom.
- Honey!

35:16.460 --> 35:18.570
[both] Mmm!

35:19.400 --> 35:20.970
That's a very pretty robe.

35:21.170 --> 35:22.020
Do you like it?

35:22.220 --> 35:23.730
I love it. You look great in it!

35:25.090 --> 35:26.850
- Doesn't she look great in it?
- Sure.

35:27.050 --> 35:28.650
Oh, stop trying to save
our relationship.

35:28.850 --> 35:30.440
You got out, you came back.
You fool.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.230
That is a pretty robe, Monica.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.610
And you do look good in it.
When did I buy that for you?

35:34.810 --> 35:35.780
You didn't. It was a gift.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.450
Michelle wants to marry me.

35:37.650 --> 35:38.950
What for?

35:39.150 --> 35:41.910
I came home
to consider the idea.

35:42.110 --> 35:44.660
[Monica] Well, how exactly
would that work?

35:44.860 --> 35:47.920
You would ask yourself
the only question that matters.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.420
"Does this girl carry within her

35:50.620 --> 35:53.590
the potential to suck out
your soul like a Nosferatu

35:53.790 --> 35:57.180
and turn you into
an undead, desiccated husk

35:57.380 --> 35:59.390
that in any strong wind
would leave you afraid

35:59.590 --> 36:02.780
you will blow out of your shoes
and turn into ashes?"

36:04.160 --> 36:05.240
No.

36:06.410 --> 36:07.910
Then go forward, my son.

36:10.330 --> 36:11.940
I thought you were
happy with her?

36:12.140 --> 36:13.280
I am happy with her.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.780
I'm happy with her every
moment we're together.

36:14.980 --> 36:16.780
But that's not enough for her.
She...

36:16.980 --> 36:19.490
She wants me to be happy
with her in the future.

36:19.690 --> 36:20.870
I think that sounds romantic.

36:21.070 --> 36:23.410
Ha! I think
it's science fiction.

36:23.610 --> 36:24.680
All right.

36:26.220 --> 36:28.100
Why are you happy with her now?

36:30.140 --> 36:32.090
She's the first person
I want to talk to

36:32.290 --> 36:33.710
about anything
that happens to me.

36:33.910 --> 36:36.340
Aww. Well then, why do you
want that to change?

36:36.540 --> 36:37.420
Why would it change?

36:37.620 --> 36:38.800
When you change
the relationship,

36:39.000 --> 36:40.550
- the relationship changes.
- I said that to her.

36:40.750 --> 36:43.050
He said that to her!
This boy that we made

36:43.250 --> 36:45.100
applied sound logic.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.320
And what did she say?

36:47.490 --> 36:49.410
She wants me to jump
off a cliff with her.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.560
I mean, is there value in that?

36:51.760 --> 36:54.480
In... holding someone's hand
and closing your eyes?

36:54.680 --> 36:57.070
[Monica] That's very young.

36:57.270 --> 36:59.700
She's traditional, Allen.

36:59.900 --> 37:02.070
You know, a perky believer
in the happily-ever-after.

37:02.270 --> 37:04.580
Which is strange. I thought
she was quite intelligent

37:04.780 --> 37:07.080
and aware of the world
in which she actually lives.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.660
- Hey, Monica--
- [Monica] But you may have found

37:08.860 --> 37:12.040
the last woman on earth
who assumes a happy ending.

37:12.240 --> 37:13.560
Hey, Monica!

37:15.230 --> 37:16.840
Mon...

37:17.040 --> 37:18.860
would you make us
a pot of coffee?

37:19.770 --> 37:21.970
I'm sorry,
what did you say to me?

37:22.170 --> 37:24.850
Because, you know, it's late
and we're not thinking clearly.

37:25.050 --> 37:27.100
And what could be
more important than this?

37:27.300 --> 37:28.680
Please, make coffee.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.690
Allen, would you tell your
father how offensive that is?

37:30.890 --> 37:32.810
Because I am standing here
talking to my son

37:33.010 --> 37:34.810
about his future.

37:35.010 --> 37:37.530
I said "please". I used
polite and cordial words.

37:37.730 --> 37:39.990
Well, I'm not finished talking
to him. I'll tell you what.

37:40.190 --> 37:42.160
Why don't you go in the kitchen
and you make the coffee?

37:42.360 --> 37:45.030
By the time you come back, I'll
have set him on the proper path

37:45.230 --> 37:47.450
and then you can talk to him
as long as you want.

37:47.650 --> 37:50.750
I tell you what. How about
you get your ass in the kitchen

37:50.950 --> 37:52.420
and make a pot of coffee

37:52.620 --> 37:55.850
or I pick you up and throw you
right the fuck out the window?

37:56.770 --> 37:59.630
Oh, my. Okay.

37:59.830 --> 38:00.650
Huh!

38:01.940 --> 38:03.260
[Allen] Dad?

38:03.460 --> 38:05.100
She's confused
by my show of strength.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.280
We've got, like, a minute.
Allen.

38:07.950 --> 38:10.270
This girl loves you.
I don't care what you think

38:10.470 --> 38:13.310
in your youth and indecision,
she loves you!

38:13.510 --> 38:16.540
How does someone know that?
How do I know if I love her?

38:17.580 --> 38:18.940
You don't have to.

38:19.140 --> 38:21.110
Love is just a word
we've attached

38:21.310 --> 38:23.700
to describe a feeling
we won't really understand

38:23.900 --> 38:25.820
until we're old enough
to look back on it.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.630
And wonder if we ever did.

38:28.220 --> 38:30.550
- What?
- [chuckles]

38:32.010 --> 38:33.540
Do you love me?

38:33.740 --> 38:35.020
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

38:36.140 --> 38:37.940
- Because I do.
- Why?

38:38.690 --> 38:40.960
Because you've cared for me.
You've seen to my well-being.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.260
- Why? Why?!
- Maybe ask a different question?

38:43.460 --> 38:45.430
- Because you're my father!
- Yes!

38:45.630 --> 38:47.100
That's it. That's right.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.510
That's all. I'm your father.

38:49.710 --> 38:52.390
And that's what we've got.
We've got mothers and fathers.

38:52.590 --> 38:54.770
We've got parents and children.

38:54.970 --> 38:57.980
And I... I dedicated
myself to you.

38:58.180 --> 39:01.440
We've grown up together,
and you've made me proud.

39:01.640 --> 39:04.820
But, Allen, I didn't choose you.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.530
You were given to me.

39:06.730 --> 39:08.760
You're not a choice that I made.

39:09.590 --> 39:11.490
But what if you were?

39:11.690 --> 39:13.080
What if we didn't
know each other,

39:13.280 --> 39:15.370
and we saw each other
on the street?

39:15.570 --> 39:18.040
Would there be some
sort of pull between us

39:18.240 --> 39:20.210
that made you know,
"This is my father"?

39:20.410 --> 39:22.260
Would I know, "This is my son"?

39:22.460 --> 39:25.880
Or would I walk away and
not give you a second thought?

39:26.080 --> 39:28.430
But the doctor said,

39:28.630 --> 39:31.680
"This one is yours."

39:31.880 --> 39:33.060
"Take him home."

39:33.260 --> 39:37.100
And I understood that
relationship completely.

But to go out and choose someone

39:40.310 --> 39:43.280

the benefit of a doctor saying,

39:43.480 --> 39:45.820
"This one's yours.
Take her home."

39:46.020 --> 39:49.170
What kind of a responsibility
is that for a person?

39:50.380 --> 39:51.910
I've never thought
about it like that.

Allen, look what
this girl has done.

39:58.490 --> 40:01.090
She's made herself
vulnerable for you.

40:01.290 --> 40:03.510
And don't worry about
if you love her now.

40:03.710 --> 40:07.340
It takes a lifetime
to love someone.

40:07.540 --> 40:10.050
It's the thing we most aspire to

40:10.250 --> 40:12.430
because no one has ever
figured it out.

40:12.630 --> 40:16.580

and you know everything's okay.

We're talking about you.

40:25.850 --> 40:27.550
It's your world now, Allen.

40:28.710 --> 40:30.490
If you value my advice,

40:30.690 --> 40:33.470
and, Allen, I've been there,

40:34.680 --> 40:36.290
marry her.

40:36.490 --> 40:37.660
Marry Martha.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.000
- Michelle.

Can I ask you something?

40:52.380 --> 40:53.850
And I understand
if you can't answer me.

40:54.050 --> 40:55.370
I'll answer you.

40:57.370 --> 40:59.330
If you had to do it
all over again,

41:01.250 --> 41:02.960
would you still marry Mom?

41:05.250 --> 41:07.860
Look what I've done!
It's magnificent.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.250
May I speak with my son now?

41:11.090 --> 41:12.910
- Yes.
- Thank you.

41:13.110 --> 41:15.580
Because it took both of us
to make you, Allen.

41:15.780 --> 41:18.100
I've never been able
to walk away knowing that.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.540
What have you done here?

41:24.740 --> 41:27.510
I made us some high tea.

41:27.710 --> 41:29.760
It's lemongrass chamomile.

41:29.960 --> 41:31.590
And cucumber sandwiches

Well, I always improve upon
his smaller expectations,

41:40.510 --> 41:42.600

unappreciated.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.160
No! No.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.870
It stays where it is,
and you wanna know why?

47:31.070 --> 47:32.640
Because every day

47:33.430 --> 47:35.290
I see that when
I put on my underwear.

47:35.490 --> 47:38.670
And the symbolism of that is:
I am married,

47:38.870 --> 47:41.000
and I am covering up
my situation.

47:41.200 --> 47:43.380
[groans]

47:43.580 --> 47:46.280
I wanna see the ring.

47:48.740 --> 47:50.220
So do I. Where is it?

47:50.420 --> 47:52.600
In my night table drawer.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.980
Next to the bible. Get it.

47:55.180 --> 47:57.330
You're a good woman, honey.

48:02.040 --> 48:04.090
You two are fabulous,
you know that?

48:05.590 --> 48:08.660
It's your fault
I believe in all this stuff.

48:08.860 --> 48:10.950
Look, we've already established
she's an old-fashioned girl.

48:11.150 --> 48:13.040
Maybe she just loves
to cook and clean.

48:13.240 --> 48:14.620
Why don't you have her over
to do the house?

48:14.820 --> 48:16.080
Hey!

48:16.280 --> 48:18.670
Are you really going to give
the rest of your life

48:18.870 --> 48:20.920
to someone because
they cook and clean?

48:21.120 --> 48:23.670
Are you gonna leave it up to us
to help you make this decision?

48:23.870 --> 48:25.460
I came to you both
to learn something.

48:25.660 --> 48:27.380
This shouldn't have
anything to do with us.

48:27.580 --> 48:29.260
Oh, but it really does.

48:29.460 --> 48:30.990
Well, what should it
have to do with?

48:31.900 --> 48:33.510
It should have to do with love.

48:33.710 --> 48:35.270
- I found it. Look at that.
- [Grace] Oh!

48:35.470 --> 48:37.140
Look at that. Uh-huh.

48:37.340 --> 48:39.900
That is the symbol of our love.

48:40.100 --> 48:42.020
Put it on, honey.

48:42.220 --> 48:44.150
Um... You know, I--

48:44.350 --> 48:46.780
Boy, I... I don't think it's
gonna fit these fingers.

48:46.980 --> 48:48.300
You wanna kiss 'em?

48:49.960 --> 48:51.910
Here.
You know what I'm gonna do?

48:52.110 --> 48:54.870
- [grunts aggressively
- Yeah, you hurt me.

48:55.070 --> 48:57.890
I'm sorry. Never take that
off again, okay?

48:58.810 --> 49:00.600
I understand your position,
honey.

49:03.270 --> 49:04.800
Look at that.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.260
Bing.

49:06.460 --> 49:08.760
That's really on now.
That's on there good. Bing!

49:08.960 --> 49:10.430
- Oh, yeah.
- [Grace] Mm-hmm.

49:10.630 --> 49:14.010
On there forever just because
I asked her one question.

49:14.210 --> 49:15.780
Do you love me?

49:17.530 --> 49:18.770
What do you mean?

49:18.970 --> 49:21.250
And if the answer is yes,
I wanna know why.

49:22.410 --> 49:23.940
I was originally captured

49:24.140 --> 49:26.670
by your strong sense
of interior design.

49:28.040 --> 49:29.380
That's why you love me?

49:30.500 --> 49:32.160
Does Michelle make you happy?

49:32.360 --> 49:33.450
I think so.

49:33.650 --> 49:35.200
How can you not know
if you're happy?

49:35.400 --> 49:36.760
Are you happy, Dad?

49:37.850 --> 49:39.680
I'm as happy as I'm gonna get.

49:41.140 --> 49:43.630
[Howard] Michelle, we're fine
with whatever you do.

49:43.830 --> 49:46.630
We just hope that
we were good influences.

49:46.830 --> 49:48.010
We always told you the truth

49:48.210 --> 49:50.340
that we believed
at the time, honey.

49:50.540 --> 49:52.680
Like when you said
I would never be a ballerina?

49:52.880 --> 49:54.760
I know, honey.
I'm sorry. You won't.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.310
[scoffs]

49:56.510 --> 49:57.560
- Here's truth.
- Okay.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.640
These people are as much
to blame as we are

49:59.840 --> 50:01.730
for all of us
arriving at this point.

50:01.930 --> 50:04.110
You think they'd have the
courtesy to invite us to dinner?

50:04.310 --> 50:05.560
[scoffs]

50:05.760 --> 50:07.730
I mean, our kid
sleeps with their kid.

50:07.930 --> 50:10.240
Doesn't that entitle us
to a dinner?

50:10.440 --> 50:12.610
He's right. Yes!
Just get him over here.

50:12.810 --> 50:14.240
- [Howard] Yes.
- Mom, seriously?

50:14.440 --> 50:16.830
Oh, I'm not gonna be blamed
for what I taught you, okay?

50:17.030 --> 50:18.370
[Howard] Go!

50:18.570 --> 50:20.000
[Grace] Yeah.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.470
Come on, let's do it.

50:23.270 --> 50:25.210
Except, why can't we go there?

50:25.410 --> 50:27.040
[sighs]

50:27.240 --> 50:29.710
Why does everything
have to be expensive for me?

50:29.910 --> 50:32.510
[line ringing]

50:32.710 --> 50:34.030
[cell phone vibrates]

50:34.990 --> 50:36.850
Michelle, my bell!

50:37.050 --> 50:38.180
- Yikes.
- How are you?

50:38.380 --> 50:40.280
We were just talking about you.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.770
Hi. You were?

50:42.970 --> 50:44.190
Endlessly.

50:44.390 --> 50:45.560
Yes-- [grunts]

50:45.760 --> 50:46.560
Howdy.

50:46.760 --> 50:48.370
Howdy to you too.

50:49.250 --> 50:50.820
Here's an interesting thing
that's gonna happen,

50:51.020 --> 50:53.300
but first, I miss you.

50:55.050 --> 50:56.260
I miss you too.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.080
Great.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.250
My parents wanna have you guys
over for dinner tonight.

51:01.450 --> 51:04.010
They think it would be nice
if we all finally got together.

51:05.560 --> 51:07.710
I'd rather just get married.

51:07.910 --> 51:09.630
So, I'll see you tonight?

51:09.830 --> 51:11.900
Instinctively, a bad idea.

51:13.770 --> 51:15.320
[whispers] Do it.

51:16.990 --> 51:20.930
So, Michelle and her parents

51:21.130 --> 51:24.060
would like to have you
over for dinner tonight.

51:24.260 --> 51:26.810
- All of us?
- No. I'm not going to that.

51:27.010 --> 51:27.940
Mute. Where's mute?

51:28.140 --> 51:29.770
No, absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

51:29.970 --> 51:32.070
This is a sucker play.
They're throwing out the net.

51:32.270 --> 51:34.280
She's gonna reel you in
like a trout.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.260
You take care of it.
Go ahead, Sam, take care of it.

51:38.380 --> 51:40.630
- [phone beeps]
- Hi, Michelle.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.300
- Hi.
- Listen.

51:44.140 --> 51:45.500
We'd love to come.

51:45.700 --> 51:48.000
- [Monica] What?!
- [Michelle] Amazing.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.880
My parents are so excited
to meet you guys.

51:51.080 --> 51:53.170
How's seven o'clock?

51:53.370 --> 51:55.720
That's great.
Can we bring anything?

51:55.920 --> 51:58.680
Just yourselves.
I'm sure that will be plenty.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.240
Looking forward to it.

52:01.660 --> 52:03.220
Why don't you wanna
meet these people?

52:03.420 --> 52:05.870
What could we possibly
have in common?

52:08.250 --> 52:10.980
Whoo! Yay!

52:11.180 --> 52:13.540
[rock music interlude]

52:25.850 --> 52:28.040
I'm in Mamaroneck.

52:28.240 --> 52:30.960
There isn't enough alcohol
in the world.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.230
[heavy sigh]

52:34.270 --> 52:36.400
I have a little bit
of a buzz on.

52:37.440 --> 52:41.150
This one's a lack of awareness
bordering on hallucination.

52:41.650 --> 52:43.320
[doorbell rings]

52:44.990 --> 52:46.280
I'll get it!

52:52.120 --> 52:54.190
God bless us, everyone.

52:54.390 --> 52:56.290
Michelle, hi.

53:00.670 --> 53:01.970
Yep.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.180
Michelle.

53:06.010 --> 53:08.580
Darling! Aww, mwah!

53:08.780 --> 53:10.430
- Mmm.
- Oh, right.

53:11.430 --> 53:13.750
Oh, what a lovely little house.

53:13.950 --> 53:16.590
Look, Sam, this is exactly
what we would have

53:16.790 --> 53:18.340
if I did quaint.

53:18.540 --> 53:21.570
And mama and papa,
where are they?

53:22.190 --> 53:25.220
[chuckles]
You did say seven, didn't you?

53:25.420 --> 53:27.020
You are right on time.

53:27.220 --> 53:28.930
They're just running
a little late.

53:29.130 --> 53:31.020
Well, we could come back
another time, couldn't we?

53:31.220 --> 53:32.190
What works for you, sweetheart?

53:32.390 --> 53:33.770
- Mother!
- [Grace] Yeah!

53:33.970 --> 53:36.570
I should've been ready, like,
twenty-flaggh minutes ago.

53:36.770 --> 53:39.530
[curious instrumental
music plays]

53:39.730 --> 53:41.090
[Michelle chuckles nervously]

53:41.710 --> 53:44.580
Hey! Oh, my goodness. Allen, hi.

53:44.780 --> 53:46.410
- Hi.
- And wait a minute.

53:46.610 --> 53:48.080
Of course,
you must be Allen's mother.

53:48.280 --> 53:52.670
Monica. It is so nice
to finally meet you.

53:52.870 --> 53:54.250
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah.

53:54.450 --> 53:56.250
Thank you. We really should've
done this a long time ago.

53:56.450 --> 53:57.590
- Right?
- Yeah.

53:57.790 --> 53:59.050
Well, now that
you've met my mother,

53:59.250 --> 54:00.900
I'd like to introduce you to...

54:01.900 --> 54:03.320
Dad?

54:04.030 --> 54:05.850
Well, Allen,
where is your father?

54:06.050 --> 54:07.310
Couldn't he make it?

54:07.510 --> 54:09.390
My husband,
did he leave us here?

54:09.590 --> 54:11.390
The door's open, so, maybe...

54:11.590 --> 54:14.580
- He's outside?
- Oh, dear. Really?

54:20.250 --> 54:21.300
Dad?

54:26.880 --> 54:28.580
Hey, everybody!

54:28.780 --> 54:30.290
Sorry I'm a little late.

54:30.490 --> 54:31.870
[both gasp]

54:32.070 --> 54:34.040
[laughs] Hey!

54:34.240 --> 54:35.880
[whispers] You're in my house?

54:36.080 --> 54:38.050
[chuckles] Yeah.
It's even worse than that.

54:38.250 --> 54:40.670
You can't kill me now.
I've got company.

54:40.870 --> 54:41.670
- Guess what?
- What?

54:41.870 --> 54:43.300
- What?
- I'm the company.

54:43.500 --> 54:44.590
Ha-ha!

54:44.790 --> 54:45.760
No, no, no...

54:45.960 --> 54:47.150
Dad?

54:48.410 --> 54:50.320
[curious music continues]

55:05.800 --> 55:07.910
Yeah! That's my son Allen

55:08.110 --> 55:10.260
who's with your wife,
holding your daughter.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.160
Oh, dear God.

55:13.360 --> 55:14.210
[laughs]

55:14.410 --> 55:16.790
Howard, uh, this is Monica.

55:16.990 --> 55:19.560
And, Monica, this is
my husband, Howard.

55:20.230 --> 55:22.610
How do you do? [muffled laugh]

55:24.780 --> 55:26.760
Hi. I'm Howard.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.110
- [Monica giggling]
- This is where I live.

55:30.610 --> 55:32.600
This is my daughter, Michelle.

55:32.800 --> 55:35.770
I am the father of her.
You know where I live now.

55:35.970 --> 55:39.080
I found your little house. Mmm.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.630
Instinctively, bad idea.

55:51.470 --> 55:54.120
Um, yeah. You know what this is?

55:54.320 --> 55:56.250
This is, um,
what would you call this,

55:56.450 --> 55:59.000
a little free-floating anxiety?

55:59.200 --> 56:01.920
- More.
- Way more.

56:02.120 --> 56:03.590
Right. Right, because

56:03.790 --> 56:05.880
everyone knows how important
this is, sweetie, really.

56:06.080 --> 56:07.380
And so, we're just trying
to make sure

56:07.580 --> 56:09.220
that it's an evening
to remember.

56:09.420 --> 56:11.530
- [Monica laughs]
- [doorbell rings]

56:12.200 --> 56:13.680
Oh, that must be my husband.

56:13.880 --> 56:16.390
Oh! Oh, well, I'll let him in.

56:16.590 --> 56:18.560
And we'll all loosen up
right now.

56:18.760 --> 56:20.310
You'll see. You'll see.

56:20.510 --> 56:21.290
[opens door]

56:27.300 --> 56:30.700
Oh! Well...

56:30.900 --> 56:32.550
No, no. I, um...

56:33.220 --> 56:35.080
That actually wasn't
your husband. [chuckles]

56:35.280 --> 56:38.710
But can I ask you a couple
questions about your husband?

56:38.910 --> 56:40.670
- Mom.
- Huh?

56:40.870 --> 56:43.920
Because it's... it's all
really too much, honey.

56:44.120 --> 56:45.460
It's just... It's like...
I mean...

56:45.660 --> 56:48.840
This could decide
the rest of our lives.

56:49.040 --> 56:50.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I think she's right.

56:50.880 --> 56:52.510
- Yeah.
- I think...

56:52.710 --> 56:54.320
I think that everybody...

56:55.660 --> 56:57.280
should go home.

56:57.990 --> 56:58.980
What?

56:59.180 --> 57:00.850
As clearly as I could,
I said it.

57:01.050 --> 57:03.650
Guys, this is happening.

57:03.850 --> 57:06.690
We... We want to decide
the rest of our lives.

57:06.890 --> 57:08.380
Well, we don't, actually.

57:09.460 --> 57:12.320
We do, and we can't
if you don't open the door.

57:12.520 --> 57:14.430
[heavy sigh]

57:17.800 --> 57:20.140
[hums]

57:20.720 --> 57:22.680
[mumbling exhale]

57:24.690 --> 57:26.400
[softly] Pray for Grace.

57:27.940 --> 57:29.420
Um...

57:29.620 --> 57:30.820
Oh!

57:31.740 --> 57:34.610
- Uh...
- [Sam clears throat]

57:36.200 --> 57:37.450
[Grace sighs heavily]

57:40.790 --> 57:42.290
Look what you did to him.

57:44.540 --> 57:46.150
[scoffs]

57:46.350 --> 57:48.570
No, you're right.
We should do this more often.

57:48.770 --> 57:49.860
You have to do something.

57:50.060 --> 57:51.550
You have to do something.
It's your house.

57:54.420 --> 57:56.370
Would anyone care for a drink?

57:56.570 --> 57:58.500
- [all] Yes!
- Ah, Michelle.

57:58.700 --> 57:59.710
Allen?

57:59.910 --> 58:01.250
We'll have wine, thank you.

58:01.450 --> 58:03.670
Wine. Grace, a drink?

58:03.870 --> 58:05.210
I do now. [awkward laugh]

58:05.410 --> 58:06.980
Oh, yes.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.130
I'll have the usual.

58:10.330 --> 58:12.300
[nervous chuckle] Come on.

58:12.500 --> 58:15.140
All right. Tanqueray martini.
Extra dry with a twist.

58:15.340 --> 58:17.910
- Ow!
- Oh, now it's "ow"?

58:18.740 --> 58:19.930
What's his name?

58:20.130 --> 58:21.690
- [Monica] Sam.
- Sam!

58:21.890 --> 58:24.060
- Yeah.
- What are you drinking, buddy?

58:24.260 --> 58:26.150
- Bourbon.
- How about a double?

58:26.350 --> 58:28.830
- How about the bottle?
- [all laugh]

58:30.000 --> 58:31.110
Who could blame you?

58:31.310 --> 58:32.860
[Grace] Oh...

58:33.060 --> 58:35.030
Look, why don't I help him
make the drinks,

58:35.230 --> 58:36.660
and you take everyone
on a tour of the house?

58:36.860 --> 58:38.240
Neither one
should take very long.

58:38.440 --> 58:40.290
[Allen] Actually, Michelle and I
have a lot to talk about.

58:40.490 --> 58:41.790
Would you like to step outside?

58:41.990 --> 58:44.220
I was wondering if you had
a place I might feel safe?

58:45.180 --> 58:47.170
Mom, show Allen's father around.

58:47.370 --> 58:48.420
Oh! Of course.

58:48.620 --> 58:50.510
You will love him.

58:50.710 --> 58:52.010
What a thing to say, honey.

58:52.210 --> 58:53.880
What a thing to say. Hi.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.740
Um, here.

58:56.320 --> 58:57.400
Um...

58:58.410 --> 59:00.240
Just, uh... Um...

59:02.200 --> 59:04.600
You didn't tell me
that you have children.

59:04.800 --> 59:06.810
You told me your son
was six years old.

59:07.010 --> 59:08.520
He was once.

59:08.720 --> 59:11.820
And you told me
that you were 54.

59:12.020 --> 59:14.570
- I was once.
- Oh!

59:14.770 --> 59:16.240
So, what are you now?

59:16.440 --> 59:17.200
Sixty-seven.

59:17.400 --> 59:19.200
Oh, 67!

59:19.400 --> 59:22.160
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be 68 last year.

59:22.360 --> 59:25.540
Oh, no!
I was making it with a corpse.

59:25.740 --> 59:28.630
Oh, lovely. Really lovely.

59:28.830 --> 59:31.460
I mean, why would anyone
ever leave you?

59:31.660 --> 59:35.900
Oh, you are not leaving me.

59:40.700 --> 59:42.810
I'm already gone, Morticia.

59:43.010 --> 59:45.770
[laughs] No. I think
we just had an off night.

59:45.970 --> 59:48.290
No! Monica, what...

59:48.870 --> 59:50.150
- Look... Look at me.
- Mmm.

59:50.350 --> 59:51.480
We don't even like each other.

59:51.680 --> 59:53.320
Why keep this going?

59:53.520 --> 59:55.200
You don't understand
how difficult it is

59:55.400 --> 59:57.200
to start a new
clandestine relationship.

59:57.400 --> 59:59.910
You have to keep track
of what guy goes with what.

1:00:00.110 --> 1:00:01.910
Sam thinks I'm angry at him.
I'm not angry at him.

1:00:02.110 --> 1:00:03.290
I just lost track of him.

1:00:03.490 --> 1:00:06.040
Well, you're not mad
at me either.

1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:09.460
[curious instrumental
music plays]

1:00:09.660 --> 1:00:11.090
You screwed up your own life.

1:00:11.290 --> 1:00:13.670
You're the only one
who can figure out a way

1:00:13.870 --> 1:00:16.130
to find some kind of happiness
or whatever you're looking for.

1:00:16.330 --> 1:00:17.860
I don't care.

1:00:18.400 --> 1:00:19.720
I'm still killing you.

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:21.760
[exasperated sigh] Monica,

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.770
nobody has to kill anyone.

1:00:23.970 --> 1:00:26.080
Time is doing
a fine job of that.

1:00:28.910 --> 1:00:31.400
- Grace...
- This is our backyard.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:33.020
And this is where we go

1:00:33.220 --> 1:00:35.590
when we want to come
to the back of the house.

1:00:36.250 --> 1:00:37.460
Last night

1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:40.450
was the sweetest night
I can remember.

1:00:40.650 --> 1:00:43.910
Oh, well, for me too, Sam.

1:00:44.110 --> 1:00:46.200
But we really can't
think about that now,

1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:48.290
because what if the kids
get married?

1:00:48.490 --> 1:00:50.380
Well, that'd be fantastic.

1:00:50.580 --> 1:00:52.000
Things couldn't work out
any better.

1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:54.800
We'd... We'd have excuses
to see each other all the time.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:55.960
Oh. Mmm.

1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:58.480
Is that incest?
I mean... It's...

1:01:00.190 --> 1:01:02.260
Grace, I think

1:01:02.460 --> 1:01:05.490
fate meant us to be together.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:09.900
Look, last night was the best
night I've had in a long time.

1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:13.150
But I want to hear those words
and feel those feelings

1:01:13.350 --> 1:01:14.920
with my husband.

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.290
[sighs]

1:01:19.340 --> 1:01:21.820
Last night, I had feelings
about my marriage too.

1:01:22.020 --> 1:01:23.450
Mmm. What?

1:01:23.650 --> 1:01:25.160
I hate my wife.

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:26.700
- You do not.
- I hate her guts.

1:01:26.900 --> 1:01:27.950
Why would you say that?

1:01:28.150 --> 1:01:29.930
- I live with her.
- Sam!

1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:32.130
Because she hates me.

1:01:32.330 --> 1:01:35.840
There's too much love in you
to hate anybody.

1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:38.130
And there is too much
love in you

1:01:38.330 --> 1:01:39.720
to not have it returned.

1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:41.690
Let me return it, Grace.

1:01:42.650 --> 1:01:44.110
[sighs]

1:01:55.580 --> 1:01:57.070
We live a long time.

1:01:57.270 --> 1:01:59.150
And we'll have kids.

1:01:59.350 --> 1:02:00.860
We'll watch them grow.

1:02:01.060 --> 1:02:02.550
And we'll be 50.

1:02:03.380 --> 1:02:05.330
Please understand that
that's a good thing.

1:02:05.530 --> 1:02:08.120
I understand it's a good thing
when we're us.

1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:09.870
But, Michelle, they were us.

1:02:10.070 --> 1:02:11.540
They believe what you believe.

1:02:11.740 --> 1:02:13.770
They believed they wouldn't
lose their minds.

1:02:14.890 --> 1:02:16.630
All I've been asking

1:02:16.830 --> 1:02:19.610
is what happens to us
on the way to them.

1:02:22.440 --> 1:02:24.300
Do we wake up

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:25.800
on some cloudy Tuesday

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.910
and we're just not excited
by each other anymore?

1:02:30.990 --> 1:02:33.600
You will always
be excited by me.

1:02:33.800 --> 1:02:36.000
Look at me.
I'm on my little bed.

1:02:45.510 --> 1:02:47.760
Don't get on my bed
looking like that.

1:02:48.590 --> 1:02:50.370
I got dressed for your parents.

1:02:50.570 --> 1:02:52.560
My mother wears turtlenecks.
Get it off.

1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:57.590
Get it off. Get it off!

1:02:57.790 --> 1:03:00.480
[both laughing]

1:03:03.900 --> 1:03:07.050
You don't touch me anymore,
remember?

1:03:07.250 --> 1:03:09.030
Oh, yeah.

1:03:18.670 --> 1:03:20.380
Now you can get in bed with me.

1:03:35.470 --> 1:03:37.020
Don't say anything.

1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:38.690
Just don't.

1:03:42.980 --> 1:03:45.900
Do we spend the greater part of
our lives as crazy as they are?

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:49.430
Do you really think
they're crazy?

1:03:49.630 --> 1:03:52.100
[Sam and Grace
argue indistinctly]

1:03:52.300 --> 1:03:53.980
Because I don't.

1:03:54.180 --> 1:03:57.230
I had feelings last night.

1:03:57.430 --> 1:03:59.810
I didn't know
I was still capable

1:04:00.010 --> 1:04:01.900
of having feelings like that.

1:04:02.100 --> 1:04:03.190
Yeah?

1:04:03.390 --> 1:04:05.700
There's only one possible
thing we can do.

1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:07.450
Forget it ever happened.

1:04:07.650 --> 1:04:10.050
You and me,

1:04:10.550 --> 1:04:13.240
- Tahiti.
- Oh, so I'm way off here.

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:15.410
This isn't coincidence.

1:04:15.610 --> 1:04:17.170
Things happen on purpose

1:04:17.370 --> 1:04:19.460
so that we can figure out
what to do with our lives.

1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:21.630
And our lives have led us here.

1:04:21.830 --> 1:04:23.170
It's not real.

1:04:23.370 --> 1:04:25.940
Sam! This isn't real.

1:04:27.190 --> 1:04:29.840
Wouldn't you want this
with a nice, younger woman?

1:04:30.040 --> 1:04:32.430
Well, my wife
is younger than me.

1:04:32.630 --> 1:04:35.810
So, what I've learned
from that is... no.

1:04:36.010 --> 1:04:37.350
And she's real.

1:04:37.550 --> 1:04:39.690
She's as real as it gets.

1:04:39.890 --> 1:04:41.980
But forgetting last night
happened isn't real,

1:04:42.180 --> 1:04:43.570
because it did.

1:04:43.770 --> 1:04:46.440
What's real is that it did.

1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:48.820
I mean, what do you think
happened last night?

1:04:49.020 --> 1:04:51.830
Sam, nothing happened.

1:04:52.030 --> 1:04:53.240
Everything happened.

1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:56.330
We talked. We had conversation.

1:04:56.530 --> 1:04:59.670
When's the last time
you really talked to someone?

1:04:59.870 --> 1:05:03.130
We shared the intimacy
that matters the most

1:05:03.330 --> 1:05:06.520
because I think that
by not touching each other,

1:05:07.900 --> 1:05:09.610
we touched each other.

1:05:11.950 --> 1:05:15.450
And... it's what I want, Grace.

1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:18.370
- Don't you?
- [sighs]

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:22.650
I grew up with them.
I watched them stay together

1:05:22.850 --> 1:05:25.400
while all my friends' parents
fell apart.

1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:26.880
I admired it.

1:05:27.420 --> 1:05:28.800
I've watched mine too.

1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:30.740
I can only go by what I've seen.

1:05:30.940 --> 1:05:33.050
And if that
is built into the deal,

1:05:34.010 --> 1:05:36.950
will we be smart enough
to recognize it when it comes?

1:05:37.150 --> 1:05:38.580
Will we recognize

1:05:38.780 --> 1:05:41.120
how easy it is to arrive at
a place where I'm not allowed

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:44.100
to say "I love you" even though
I really think I do.

1:05:45.060 --> 1:05:46.500
Allen.

1:05:46.700 --> 1:05:49.550
We're so good together.
What are you doing?

1:05:49.750 --> 1:05:52.150
I don't want it to happen to us.

1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:55.320
So, help me out, okay?
You help me out.

1:05:56.450 --> 1:05:58.600
How do you marry
a person you love?

1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:00.870
How do you do that to somebody?

1:06:01.870 --> 1:06:03.350
Wow.

1:06:03.550 --> 1:06:04.830
You're angry at me?

1:06:05.620 --> 1:06:07.250
How could I be?

1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:10.800
This has nothing to do
with you and me at all.

1:06:29.150 --> 1:06:32.360
Oh, my goodness.
Have you come to a decision?

1:06:38.200 --> 1:06:40.280
I'm gonna try one last time.

1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:42.560
Don't let what
you don't know is coming

1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.910
get in the way of what
you know we have now.

1:06:46.080 --> 1:06:47.540
I do know what's coming.

1:06:48.540 --> 1:06:50.030
I understand
there's gonna be easy parts,

1:06:50.230 --> 1:06:51.950
like our wedding day and
the birthdays of our children,

1:06:52.150 --> 1:06:53.910
and I understand we're gonna
be all over each other

1:06:54.110 --> 1:06:55.120
for the first five years.

1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:56.800
Thanks for the image, kid.

1:07:00.390 --> 1:07:02.100
But what about the hard parts?

1:07:02.930 --> 1:07:04.670
What about the day
that we don't remember

1:07:04.870 --> 1:07:07.250
we gave each other
the best parts of our lives?

1:07:07.450 --> 1:07:11.010
Because...
Because we're too busy

1:07:11.210 --> 1:07:13.590
blaming each other for being
two middle-aged potatoes.

1:07:13.790 --> 1:07:14.880
Oh, God.

1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:17.300
Honesty can't hurt us.
So, you make me see.

1:07:17.500 --> 1:07:19.860
What keeps that from being
the rest of our lives?

1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:23.790
You're wrong
about the easy part.

1:07:24.370 --> 1:07:25.650
The easiest thing we could do

1:07:25.850 --> 1:07:27.060
is smash this up and move on

1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:28.900
and keep asking ourselves
the same questions

1:07:29.100 --> 1:07:30.290
but with other people.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:33.440
And if I do...

1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:36.240
If I do find somebody else,
the difference will be

1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:38.840
that I already knew you.

1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:42.160
You will be my frame of
reference for loving somebody,

1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:45.060
and I will compare them to you
and they will fail.

1:07:46.060 --> 1:07:47.640
Why would you do that to me?

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:53.690
And if we do someday
have children with someone else,

1:07:55.070 --> 1:07:57.220
your little girl
won't look like me.

1:07:57.420 --> 1:07:59.470
You won't be able
to see me and everything

1:07:59.670 --> 1:08:01.010
we've gone through
over the years in her face.

1:08:01.210 --> 1:08:02.520
And when she finds her person,

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.580
it'll never remind you of what
you and I had together.

1:08:07.580 --> 1:08:10.110
That's how we hang onto the best
parts of our lives, Allen.

1:08:10.310 --> 1:08:12.360
That's what saves us.

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:15.130
[gentle guitar music playing]

1:08:19.170 --> 1:08:20.680
Jump with me.

1:08:23.590 --> 1:08:26.330
How can you ask me to promise
you we won't go crazy later?

1:08:26.530 --> 1:08:28.140
You're crazy now.

1:08:32.770 --> 1:08:34.440
Unless you found something.

1:08:35.150 --> 1:08:37.570
Have you finally found
something wrong with me?

1:08:38.230 --> 1:08:39.800
You've had enough time,
so just tell me.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.280
Just tell me. What's wrong with
this girl right here, right now?

1:08:48.540 --> 1:08:49.910
We're us, Allen.

1:08:51.370 --> 1:08:53.120
Nobody else.

1:08:55.750 --> 1:08:58.880
And I will miss you
for the rest of my life.

1:09:01.470 --> 1:09:03.550
Honey, come on...

1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:06.890
Allen...

1:09:09.430 --> 1:09:11.850
Go after her, please.

1:09:13.730 --> 1:09:17.230
No, he's gotta do this
by himself, buddy.

1:09:19.820 --> 1:09:22.490
[gentle piano music playing]

1:09:25.450 --> 1:09:26.530
Nothing.

1:09:29.290 --> 1:09:31.290
There's nothing
the matter with you.

1:09:34.420 --> 1:09:36.710
I've never not ever
found one thing wrong.

1:09:45.930 --> 1:09:47.830
You raised the most wonderful
person I know.

1:09:48.030 --> 1:09:50.180
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

1:09:51.100 --> 1:09:52.810
And she's my best friend.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:09:57.310
I don't care
what she does to me.

1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:00.400
Now that's a good way
to go into this.

1:10:15.790 --> 1:10:17.330
We did this to them?

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:20.420
Mostly you.

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:24.700
I always wondered why
babies are born so helpless

1:10:24.900 --> 1:10:29.250
and why we get them
when they can't do anything.

1:10:29.450 --> 1:10:32.710
And I always thought
that was for us.

1:10:32.910 --> 1:10:36.170
So that we'd look back
when they grew up,

1:10:36.370 --> 1:10:39.880
and be proud that we taught them
everything that they knew.

1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:42.090
Because they didn't
know anything.

1:10:42.290 --> 1:10:46.430
But it wasn't for us
at all, was it?

1:10:46.630 --> 1:10:47.820
It's for them.

1:10:48.700 --> 1:10:50.350
It's to keep them from realizing

1:10:50.550 --> 1:10:54.160
that we don't know what we're
doing for as long as possible.

1:10:54.910 --> 1:10:56.870
[sighs] But you know what?

1:10:57.670 --> 1:10:59.880
They figure it out anyway.

1:11:01.670 --> 1:11:02.920
[Howard chuckles softly]

1:11:05.470 --> 1:11:06.920
We knew what we were doing.

1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:08.870
You heard him.

1:11:09.070 --> 1:11:13.140
We've raised
an incredible daughter.

1:11:13.930 --> 1:11:16.040
I want another chance.

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:17.460
What?

1:11:17.660 --> 1:11:19.400
I would get it right this time.

1:11:27.070 --> 1:11:28.890
We got a lot of it right.

1:11:29.090 --> 1:11:30.720
No. Didn't you see her?

1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.530
She's a ballerina
and I missed it.

1:11:35.580 --> 1:11:37.330
[sighs] Okay.

1:11:38.370 --> 1:11:40.320
Well, we can't do it again.

1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.360
You get one ride.

1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:44.700
- And one ride only.
- Uh-huh.

1:11:44.900 --> 1:11:46.950
We've done what we've done.

1:11:47.150 --> 1:11:48.780
Well, why didn't you
just stop me

1:11:48.980 --> 1:11:50.990
from becoming a potato?

1:11:51.190 --> 1:11:52.790
- [both laugh]
- You're not a potato.

1:11:52.990 --> 1:11:54.910
I am, I am. I'm a potato.

1:11:55.110 --> 1:11:57.500
And it was your responsibility
to stop me when

1:11:57.700 --> 1:12:00.130
- I started turning into one.
- Grace. It...

1:12:00.330 --> 1:12:02.210
But you weren't
paying attention.

1:12:02.410 --> 1:12:03.840
[both sigh]

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:06.220
I'm sorry I made you
feel that way.

1:12:06.420 --> 1:12:09.760
I think my son
is absolutely right.

1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:10.860
About what?

1:12:11.660 --> 1:12:14.480
Honesty cannot hurt us.

1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:16.060
Sure it can.

1:12:16.260 --> 1:12:18.900
Would everyone like to start out
with some little hot dogs?

1:12:19.100 --> 1:12:21.190
- No.
- [Grace] I made them because

1:12:21.390 --> 1:12:24.820
everyone likes them
and nothing bad has happened

1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:27.410
- when I make them.
- The four of us, for instance.

1:12:27.610 --> 1:12:29.660
Have we really been honest
with each other?

1:12:29.860 --> 1:12:32.030
- [both] Monica!
- Oh, right. You... You should...

1:12:32.230 --> 1:12:34.000
- Probably take this, yeah.
- Yeah, it's my house,

1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:36.290
- so I spoke up, but she's--
- My wife, so I guess--

1:12:36.490 --> 1:12:37.790
On you, yeah.

1:12:37.990 --> 1:12:39.630
- Unless you'd rather--
- No.

1:12:39.830 --> 1:12:42.380
I, for one, have
absolutely no intention

1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:44.380
of living out
the rest of my life

1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:48.340
even remotely being thought of
as a potato.

1:12:48.540 --> 1:12:49.890
Nobody thinks of you
as a potato.

1:12:50.090 --> 1:12:51.350
Oh, really?
What do they think of me as?

1:12:51.550 --> 1:12:53.510
That thing that
mashes the potato.

1:12:53.710 --> 1:12:55.390
- [quiet chuckle]
- But I will be living

1:12:55.590 --> 1:12:57.270
the rest of my life honestly.

1:12:57.470 --> 1:13:00.400
And so, I don't want to talk
about tonight anymore.

1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:01.980
I think she's right.

1:13:02.180 --> 1:13:03.980
I think whatever happens,
the kids have this well in hand.

1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:06.130
I want to talk about last night.

1:13:07.380 --> 1:13:09.910
This evening is not about
what you want, Monica.

1:13:10.110 --> 1:13:11.280
Oh, what's it about?

1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:14.410
It's about Michelle and Allen,

1:13:14.610 --> 1:13:16.540
and our part in the decision
they're making.

1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:18.290
They've watched us
their whole lives.

1:13:18.490 --> 1:13:20.630
They know who we are,
and they don't want to be us.

1:13:20.830 --> 1:13:21.880
I don't want to be us either.

1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:23.750
Monica, I'd like to talk to you.

1:13:23.950 --> 1:13:25.510
You do?
You wanna talk to me, really?

1:13:25.710 --> 1:13:27.470
Well, you go right ahead, Sam.

1:13:27.670 --> 1:13:30.260
- Not here.
- Oh. Where would you prefer?

1:13:30.460 --> 1:13:31.940
Someplace private.

1:13:32.990 --> 1:13:34.640
The bedroom?
The bedroom's private.

1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:37.140
Do you wanna talk in the bed...
May we borrow your bedroom?

1:13:37.340 --> 1:13:38.560
We're just gonna talk in it.

1:13:38.760 --> 1:13:40.100
We don't kiss or do
anything like that anymore.

1:13:40.300 --> 1:13:43.310
We used to kiss every night
before we went to bed.

1:13:43.510 --> 1:13:46.030
We made a point of it,
and I liked that.

1:13:46.230 --> 1:13:48.690
- [Sam sighs]
- It was hopeful.

1:13:48.890 --> 1:13:49.960
What was it he said?

1:13:51.050 --> 1:13:52.620
Do you even remember

1:13:52.820 --> 1:13:55.790
that we gave each other
the best parts of our lives?

1:13:55.990 --> 1:13:57.790
I remember everything.

1:13:57.990 --> 1:14:00.000
But when you stop kissing
each other good night,

1:14:00.200 --> 1:14:02.420
and you just say "goodnight"
or sometimes you don't say that,

1:14:02.620 --> 1:14:05.130
and then you just turn out your
little light and roll over

1:14:05.330 --> 1:14:06.980
and you leave me sitting there,

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:11.320
then it's necessary to go
elsewhere for hopeful.

1:14:11.820 --> 1:14:13.010
Do you know what I'm saying?

1:14:13.210 --> 1:14:16.100
- [all] No!
- Or look elsewhere

1:14:16.300 --> 1:14:20.490
for a memorable evening
with the lights on.

1:14:21.620 --> 1:14:23.730
What do you think I do at night

1:14:23.930 --> 1:14:25.580
when I'm not at home, Sam?

1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:27.440
I try not to think about it.

1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:28.940
Oh, why don't you
think about it?

1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:30.570
Because it doesn't matter to me.

1:14:30.770 --> 1:14:33.530
Because I just want to
turn over and go to sleep.

1:14:33.730 --> 1:14:34.870
Okay, you asked your question.

1:14:35.070 --> 1:14:37.080
- You got your answer.
- Well, it matters to me.

1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:39.640
It matters to me
what happened last night.

1:14:41.510 --> 1:14:45.080
So, in the continuing search
for a memorable evening,

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:47.590
I'm just gonna sparkle
this one up a little.

1:14:47.790 --> 1:14:49.840
No! It wasn't me.

1:14:50.040 --> 1:14:51.270
I wasn't with him.

1:14:53.110 --> 1:14:54.090
No, honey,
you don't have this right.

1:14:54.290 --> 1:14:55.850
- What?
- I knew I'd get caught.

1:14:56.050 --> 1:14:58.530
Next time, why don't I
just send invitations?

1:14:59.370 --> 1:15:00.990
Why do you both
not have this right?

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:03.940
I was home
in front of the television,

1:15:04.140 --> 1:15:06.190
and you know that, Howard,
and you know that.

1:15:06.390 --> 1:15:08.870
Of course you were.
Of course I know that. Yeah.

1:15:11.210 --> 1:15:12.990
I wasn't, Howard.

1:15:13.190 --> 1:15:14.460
I wasn't home.

1:15:15.170 --> 1:15:18.200
Grace, what the hell
are you talking about?

1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:19.990
What the hell are you
talking about?

1:15:20.190 --> 1:15:23.430
I'm talking about me and Grace.
What are you talking about?

1:15:24.850 --> 1:15:27.350
Well, I was talking about
me and Howard.

1:15:29.650 --> 1:15:31.920
But, obviously,
the news is elsewhere.

1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:33.170
Howard!

1:15:33.370 --> 1:15:35.510
Grace,
I made a terrible mistake.

1:15:35.710 --> 1:15:37.320
I mean, obviously!
You know her now.

1:15:38.610 --> 1:15:40.310
[screams]
How could you do this?!

1:15:40.510 --> 1:15:42.180
How could I? How could you?

1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:44.270
The same way you could.

1:15:44.470 --> 1:15:46.440
And since when could you?

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:47.710
I could and I'm good at it.

1:15:55.630 --> 1:15:57.800
I just killed you.
Now it's over.

1:15:58.510 --> 1:16:00.280
Have a nice day.

1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:02.830
[retreating footsteps]

1:16:03.030 --> 1:16:05.260
[soft jazz instrumentals]

1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:11.350
How long have you known my wife?

1:16:12.690 --> 1:16:14.300
Four months.

1:16:14.500 --> 1:16:15.440
How long have you?

1:16:16.570 --> 1:16:17.740
One night.

1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:20.650
Hardly seems fair.

1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:22.450
[music ends]

1:16:23.780 --> 1:16:25.140
- She have fun?
- What?

1:16:25.340 --> 1:16:26.850
Did my wife have fun?

1:16:27.050 --> 1:16:29.160
We had one wonderful evening.

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:31.400
Good. That's good.

1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:32.860
You're not angry about that?

1:16:33.060 --> 1:16:35.040
Yeah, well, who am I
supposed to be angry at, her?

1:16:36.170 --> 1:16:38.450
Like she doesn't deserve
to have whatever she wants?

1:16:38.650 --> 1:16:39.550
You...?

1:16:40.420 --> 1:16:41.530
[scoffs]

1:16:41.730 --> 1:16:43.720
You seem like
the sweetest guy alive.

1:16:46.810 --> 1:16:48.970
All we did
was talk to each other.

1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:50.420
What?

1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:52.520
That's all. We talked for hours.

1:16:54.310 --> 1:16:56.340
You talked for hours?

1:16:56.540 --> 1:16:58.220
About every little thing.

1:16:58.420 --> 1:17:00.090
She wouldn't let
anything else happen.

1:17:00.290 --> 1:17:01.570
That's all she wanted.

1:17:02.450 --> 1:17:05.950
She continues to prove herself
to be a better person than me.

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:08.730
So, what are we
supposed to do now?

1:17:08.930 --> 1:17:10.040
I don't know.

1:17:10.830 --> 1:17:12.460
Wanna beat each other up?

1:17:15.540 --> 1:17:16.780
Yeah.

1:17:16.980 --> 1:17:18.590
[Howard] N... No...

1:17:21.050 --> 1:17:23.530
- Okay. Ca-ca-ca...
- Come on, get up.

1:17:23.730 --> 1:17:26.330
- Get up.
- [laughs] Okay.

1:17:26.530 --> 1:17:28.120
[soft jazz resumes]

1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:29.560
[makes whooshing sounds]

1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:31.830
Are you in love with my wife?

1:17:32.030 --> 1:17:34.000
- [laughs]
- Huh?

1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:36.050
What, are you kidding me? No!

1:17:36.250 --> 1:17:37.940
No! No!

1:17:38.730 --> 1:17:40.090
Damn it.

1:17:40.290 --> 1:17:42.640
No. Come on. I'm sorry.

1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:45.140
[splutters] Sam.

1:17:45.340 --> 1:17:47.410
Sam, I'm sorry.
It was a mistake.

1:17:49.030 --> 1:17:51.700
- It was a mistake.
- [gentle music playing]

1:17:52.790 --> 1:17:54.400
Yeah, probably for me too.

1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:56.130
Yeah. Sam.

1:17:56.710 --> 1:17:58.090
It's okay, it's okay.

1:17:58.540 --> 1:18:01.840
- Yeah. Sam, buddy.
- [heavy sigh]

1:18:04.260 --> 1:18:06.950
There's a whole big world
out there for you.

1:18:07.150 --> 1:18:08.540
Guy like you,

1:18:08.740 --> 1:18:10.710
what kind of world would this be

1:18:10.910 --> 1:18:12.930
if there wasn't a happy ending
for a guy like you?

1:18:14.890 --> 1:18:16.300
[Sam sighs]

1:18:16.500 --> 1:18:18.020
Maybe it's possible.

1:18:18.980 --> 1:18:21.110
Your wife taught me
that I can love again.

1:18:23.110 --> 1:18:24.700
Yeah, great.

1:18:26.110 --> 1:18:27.620
That's really great.

1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:34.400
You really have feelings
for her, don't you?

1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:36.770
I want to go to Tahiti with her.

1:18:36.970 --> 1:18:38.250
[wry laugh]

1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:41.840
Well, I probably shouldn't
allow that, should I?
