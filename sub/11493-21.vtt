Hmm.

00:25.660 --> 00:28.744
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's the ticket.

01:37.532 --> 01:39.014

01:54.698 --> 01:56.499
Yeah, you and Zoey
don't really gel,

01:56.501 --> 01:58.384
so, I just thought
it'd be for the best.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.970
Oh, oh, that's fine.
Uh, but, uh, you know,

02:00.972 --> 02:04.139
just for the record, I gel
with pretty much everybody.

02:04.141 --> 02:08.009

02:08.012 --> 02:10.679

So, the plan is, I come
back after a week?

02:13.601 --> 02:16.735
Uh, you might want to think of
this as a trial run of your own.

Zoey and I do decide to

and someone who's trying to get
into her mother's pants.

03:45.624 --> 03:48.675
All right, look, it's not going
to be any extra work for you.

03:48.677 --> 03:50.660

take care of, I'll handle.

03:50.662 --> 03:51.995

All right, look, Berta, if you
don't want to help me with this,

04:54.443 --> 04:55.992
I will find another housekeeper

Why?
