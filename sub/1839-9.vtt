09:42.734 --> 09:46.934
I THINK SOMEONE'S
ABOUT TO GET JUICED.

09:46.934 --> 09:51.300
MAN, I'D HATE TO BE
THAT GUY.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.100
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.967
BEFORE YOU JUICE ME,
CAN I ASK YOU
ONE QUICK QUESTION?

10:02.967 --> 10:04.567
OH, YEAH, IT HURTS.

10:04.567 --> 10:05.700
NO, NO, NO. I WAS
JUST CURIOUS.

10:05.700 --> 10:09.967
UM, HOW MANY LUNCHES
WOULD YOU SAY YOU SNATCH
A DAY?

10:09.967 --> 10:12.367
I DON'T KNOW. 10, 20.

10:12.367 --> 10:15.700
AND HOW MANY DO YOU
ACTUALLY EAT?

10:15.700 --> 10:17.500
WHAT IS THIS, A TEST?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.767
'CAUSE I DON'T TEST WELL.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.233
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S, UM...

10:20.233 --> 10:22.900
IT'S--IT'S NOT A TEST.
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.000
UM, OUT OF ALL
THOSE LUNCHES YOU SNATCH,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.900
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE ONES
YOU DON'T EAT?

10:27.900 --> 10:31.133
I JUICE 'EM, LIKE
I'M TRYING TO DO
TO YOUR HEAD,

10:31.133 --> 10:32.233
BUT YOU KEEP TALKING.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.567
SEE? SEE? SEE?
RIGHT THERE, OK?

10:34.567 --> 10:36.500
YOU SHOULD BE<i>SELLING </i>
THOSE LUNCHES

10:36.500 --> 10:39.667
BACK TO THE KIDS
YOU'RE SNATCHING 'EM FROM.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.500
I COULD<i>DO </i>THAT?

10:41.500 --> 10:42.400
YEAH. YEAH.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.200

THEY ARE SCARED.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.834
THEY'RE HUNGRY.
THEY'RE HUNGRY.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.600
AND, HEY, THEY'RE
THE PERFECT CUSTOMERS.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.200
HEH HEH HEH.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.600
HOW MUCH SHOULD
I SELL 'EM FOR?

10:51.600 --> 10:52.734
OH, OH...

11:25.567 --> 11:28.900
MAN, I SHOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT.

11:28.900 --> 11:29.467
WHAT?
NOTHING.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.867
I WAS JUST THINKING
OF YOUR FAVORITE COLOR,

11:31.867 --> 11:33.900
WHICH IS, UH...

11:34.600 --> 11:36.233
CHARTREUSE.

11:36.233 --> 11:42.200

WHICH IS...6.

11:42.200 --> 11:47.567
OR YOUR FAVORITE ICE CREAM,
WHICH SO HAPPENS TO BE
SOY BEAN--

11:48.233 --> 11:50.200

11:56.133 --> 11:58.100
I'M SORRY
I SNAPPED AT YOU.
HEY...

11:58.100 --> 12:00.066
IT'S JUST...
I DON'T KNOW--

12:00.066 --> 12:00.667
I HATE
WHEN WE FIGHT.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.800
IT'S LIKE--MAKES ME
WANT TO CRY,
YOU KNOW?

12:02.800 --> 12:05.100
KIND OF LIKE
WHEN I WATCH
MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.667
I KNOW YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT ONE IS.

12:06.667 --> 12:09.667
OF COURSE I DO.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:12.400 --> 12:13.300
I WOULD REMEMBER IT FASTER

12:13.300 --> 12:15.900
IF YOU LET GO OF
MY THINKING HAND!

12:19.600 --> 12:24.834
UM...WELL,
I WAS THINKING THAT
IT'S UH...

12:26.000 --> 12:27.567

12:27.567 --> 12:28.900

12:28.900 --> 12:31.000
YES! YES, IT IS
<i>THE WIZARD OF OZ.</i>

12:31.000 --> 12:35.767
I WAS JUST MAKING SURE
THAT YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.400
AND I DID.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.967
CHELS, CONGRATULATIONS.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.500
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.500
YOU'RE AMAZING.

12:44.867 --> 12:47.000
OOH, RAE, YOU SMUDGED
YOUR THINKING HAND,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.734
LIKE, ALL OVER
YOUR FOREHEAD.

12:48.734 --> 12:49.900
OH, SNAP!

12:49.900 --> 12:50.767
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:50.767 --> 12:54.400
YOU DON'T HAVE
A THINKING HAND.
NOBODY DOES.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.800
[GASPS] HEY!

12:57.800 --> 12:59.367
WHAT IS ALL

13:00.066 --> 13:02.567
CHELS, YOU GOT ME.
I CALLED YOUR MOM,

13:02.567 --> 13:04.400
AND I TOOK SOME NOTES, OK?

13:04.400 --> 13:05.000
WHAT?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.500
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY BEST FRIEND,

13:06.500 --> 13:07.700
AND YOU NEEDED
A CHEAT SHEET?

13:07.700 --> 13:08.600
I WOULDN'T NEED
A CHEAT SHEET

13:08.600 --> 13:11.100
IF YOU WEREN'T HUNG UP
ON ALL THE STUPID DETAILS.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.400
THOSE STUPID DETAILS
ARE MY LIFE.

13:13.400 --> 13:14.967
WHICH TURNS OUT
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.767
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS WHOLE ARGUMENT
IS STUPID.

13:16.767 --> 13:19.033
MAYBE OUR WHOLE
FRIENDSHIP IS STUPID.

13:19.033 --> 13:21.567
HERE. WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE BACK THIS STUPID
SWEATER YOU LOANED ME?

13:21.567 --> 13:23.800
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WILL.
AND IT WASN'T STUPID

13:23.800 --> 13:29.000
UNTIL YOU PUT IT ON
AND YOU TURNED IT STUPID.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.767
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TAKE YOUR STUPID
RAINBOW CD BACK.

13:31.767 --> 13:35.367
OH, IF IT WAS SO STUPID,
WHY'D YOU LISTEN TO IT
A MILLION STUPID TIMES?!

13:35.367 --> 13:39.467
'CAUSE I COULDN'T EVEN
FATHOM HOW STUPID IT WAS.

13:39.467 --> 13:41.900
OK, HERE. TAKE BACK
THIS STUPID CLIP.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.300
TAKE BACK YOUR
STUPID SUNGLASSES!

13:44.300 --> 13:46.467
OK, OK, TAKE BACK

13:54.567 --> 13:58.133
IS THAT THE FRIENDSHIP
BRACELET I GAVE YOU

13:59.900 --> 14:01.767
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
THIRD GRADE.

14:01.767 --> 14:03.834
AND YOU KEPT IT
ALL THIS TIME?

14:03.834 --> 14:04.934
WELL, YEAH.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.300
OOH, JUICE. GET ME

14:44.934 --> 14:46.867
IT'S NOT THAT KIND
OF JUICE, CHELS. OK?

14:46.867 --> 14:49.467
HE'S ABOUT TO GET
HIS HEAD SQUEEZED.

14:49.467 --> 14:52.200

15:26.900 --> 15:29.734
STAY AWAY FROM THE JUICE.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.567
I THINK I'LL STICK
WITH THE MEATBALLS.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.867
IS IT ME, OR
WAS THE LUNCH LADY

15:47.867 --> 15:51.000
TOTALLY HITTING

15:55.100 --> 15:57.934
CORY...

15:57.934 --> 15:59.900
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

15:59.900 --> 16:00.467

16:00.467 --> 16:04.300
DUDE, YOUR IDEA TO
SELL THESE LUNCHES
BACK TO THESE LOSERS

16:04.300 --> 16:06.667
IS MAKING ME
A FORTUNE.

16:08.233 --> 16:12.100
OOPS! EHH. SORRY.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.200
I DROPPED MY BEAUTY MARK.

AIN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

16:25.834 --> 16:27.300
HERE'S A LUNCH
I DIDN'T LIKE.

16:27.300 --> 16:32.600
GO SELL IT BACK

WHY--WHY--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!

16:59.100 --> 17:00.800
WELL, I HAD A VISION
THAT YOU WERE GONNA
GET JUICED,

17:00.800 --> 17:03.767
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU AND THE JUICER
ARE WORKING TOGETHER.

17:03.767 --> 17:06.100
LISTEN, I'M JUST TRYING
TO SURVIVE.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.834
AND SINCE WHEN
DO YOU CARE?

17:07.834 --> 17:09.567
YOU ONLY THINK
ABOUT YOURSELF.

17:09.567 --> 17:11.767
OH...YEAH.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.133

ANY QUESTIONS.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.734
JUST GIVE ME $3.00,

17:39.734 --> 17:42.000
OK, BUT IF YOU'RE
TAKING THAT LUNCH LADY OUT,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.400
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
