A NETFLIX SERIES

00:14.625 --> 00:15.791
What do you mean?

00:19.083 --> 00:19.916
Caraíva.

00:21.416 --> 00:22.375
Remember Vanessa?

00:24.250 --> 00:25.083
So,

00:26.708 --> 00:27.666
she's my mother.

00:33.666 --> 00:34.500
Yasmin?

00:38.000 --> 00:39.416
What's the matter?

00:44.583 --> 00:46.500
It's that Yasmin

00:47.541 --> 00:50.958
has an issue with some papers…

00:53.125 --> 00:55.541
but I'll sort it out, okay?

00:56.916 --> 00:59.458
-Is everything okay, Yasmin?
-Yes.

01:00.916 --> 01:02.833
Maresia took care of it.

01:03.708 --> 01:05.750
Get some rest, tomorrow will be intense.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.666
Can you file these for me, please?

01:08.750 --> 01:10.333
-Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

01:20.541 --> 01:21.500
<i>I talked to him.</i>

01:22.875 --> 01:26.708
<i>I spit out everything</i>
<i>that I kept inside for years.</i>

01:30.250 --> 01:31.708
<i>You know what he did?</i>

01:32.583 --> 01:33.416
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:35.291 --> 01:37.208
<i>He pretended it wasn't with him.</i>

01:53.208 --> 01:54.708
<i>Mom was right.</i>

01:55.583 --> 01:57.250
<i>I shouldn't have come.</i>

02:00.833 --> 02:03.750
<i>Everything about this island</i>
<i>is different from me.</i>

02:06.208 --> 02:10.166
GIVE OUR HOMES BACK

02:10.250 --> 02:11.500
<i>Almost everything.</i>

02:15.250 --> 02:18.083
FISHERMEN ARE EVICTED

02:31.291 --> 02:35.041
EVICTION ORDER

02:36.625 --> 02:40.916
THE ISLAND BELONGS TO ALL

02:43.041 --> 02:45.750
You know what? I'm going back to our hood.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.250
But, first, I'll wake these people up.

03:40.750 --> 03:43.083
DO NOT DISTURB

03:44.166 --> 03:45.541
It's too hot.

03:48.791 --> 03:51.375
-Good morning, team.
-Good morning.

03:51.458 --> 03:52.708
My goodness.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.041
First thing,

03:54.125 --> 03:57.041
work as if I couldn't know
you partied last night.

03:57.125 --> 04:00.083
Don't worry, boss.
Everything is under control.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.250
Right.

04:01.916 --> 04:03.541
Second thing, towels.

04:03.625 --> 04:07.958
Keep the room towels in the rooms
and pool towels by the pool, okay?

04:08.041 --> 04:09.916
Aren't all towels the same?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.958
And last, but not least,
guests are like trolls.

04:14.041 --> 04:18.250
They're on vacation, nothing to do.
At some point, what will they do?

04:18.333 --> 04:21.166
-Complain.
-Exactly. We can't give them a reason to.

04:22.666 --> 04:23.750
Thanks, guys.

04:23.833 --> 04:26.666
Go wash those faces. You look awful.

04:27.708 --> 04:31.416
We'd have slept better
if the air-conditioning was working.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.458
Right?

04:34.125 --> 04:35.750
Thank you, Yasmin.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.833
We ordered the service,
but it hasn't been approved yet.

04:40.375 --> 04:41.208
Yasmin?

04:41.875 --> 04:46.250
Why don't you use your insightful eye
and take pictures for the hotel profile.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.583
Your resume says you take pictures.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.916
Catarina will be
at the reception all morning.

04:53.000 --> 04:53.833
It'd be cool.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.250
Sounds good.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.750
Great. The passwords are in the notebook.

04:59.791 --> 05:00.791
Yasmin?

05:01.958 --> 05:03.458
First lesson in Miguel Land,

05:04.750 --> 05:06.916
the less attention you draw, the better.

05:24.125 --> 05:24.958
Yasmin.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.375
I was looking for you.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.166
This place makes great pictures, right?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.666
You have no idea.

05:39.083 --> 05:39.916
It's

05:40.916 --> 05:43.166
about yesterday, I'm sorry, I--

05:44.416 --> 05:46.125
You were too straightforward.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.291
Then, Vilma arrived--

05:49.791 --> 05:51.916
-I needed time.
-Time?

05:53.125 --> 05:54.833
To understand it--

05:56.916 --> 06:00.541
-It's a lot, right?
-Yeah. Okay, Maresia.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.708
-Take your time. I've got work to do.
-No, Yasmin.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.125
Yasmin.

06:18.833 --> 06:20.958
My God! Shit!

06:35.958 --> 06:38.041
#TheIslandBelongsToThePeople

06:39.458 --> 06:42.041
SHARE

06:43.791 --> 06:44.625
My God.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.166
Thanks for waking me up.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.041
I'd comb my hair.

06:50.625 --> 06:54.958
You know how it is. The front desk is
the hotel's first and last impressions.

06:55.708 --> 06:56.583
Yasmin.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.333
Listen, you're a smart girl.

07:00.833 --> 07:01.791
Follow my logic.

07:01.875 --> 07:05.291
We share the room, the reception desk,

07:05.375 --> 07:07.916
we'll be sharing the toothpaste soon.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.166
We're on the same boat.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.250
You're a smart girl, Catarina.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.250
Eventually, you'll understand
we're not even in the same ocean.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.750
Good morning, front desk.

07:22.291 --> 07:23.458
Yes.

07:23.958 --> 07:26.458
It's late, but it won't take much longer.

07:27.583 --> 07:28.500
You're welcome.

07:30.458 --> 07:33.125
Don't say I'm being tough on you.

07:33.625 --> 07:35.541
-I took your order.
-What's that?

07:36.291 --> 07:37.500
A full brunch,

07:37.583 --> 07:40.125
ten warm croissants, fruit jam

07:41.000 --> 07:44.625
and pancakes, one regular and nine vegans.

07:44.708 --> 07:46.333
Why do I have to bring it?

07:47.208 --> 07:49.791
They requested you. Bungalow 12.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.083
Great.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.375
-Have a good day.
-You too.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.458
-Excuse me.
-Look who's here.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.625
That took a while. Damn!

08:14.958 --> 08:18.875
-Apologies for the delay.
-Aw, "apologies for the delay."

08:18.958 --> 08:21.833
The poor thing. So cute wearing a uniform.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.208
It's her first day. Be nice.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.958
Miss, the juice
should be freshly squeezed.

08:32.541 --> 08:34.458
We need our vitamin C, right?

08:37.416 --> 08:38.458
Bring another one.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.958
Of course. I'll be right back.

08:55.291 --> 08:56.750
Almost there.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.333
Now we're talking.

09:03.416 --> 09:07.916
Where I come from,
we call it "breeze from the hood."

09:08.000 --> 09:09.333
Enjoy.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.666
Thank God.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.375
<i>It's here! It's time!</i>

09:13.458 --> 09:14.291
No way!

09:14.375 --> 09:16.625
<i>Boom!</i>

09:16.708 --> 09:19.791
Finally, the birthday boy
has reached maturity age.

09:19.875 --> 09:22.708
-I can't believe it.
-What's going on?

09:22.791 --> 09:26.000
This poor guy was abandoned
in the Lost and Found.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.708
And the hotel policy says

09:27.791 --> 09:31.416
that if in four months the owner
doesn't claim it, this phone--

09:31.500 --> 09:32.708
Is ours.

09:32.791 --> 09:36.833
Now, you are free. Free to fly!

09:40.208 --> 09:42.000
Guys, I have an idea.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.291
What if we use the money
we make with the phone

09:45.375 --> 09:47.500
to help the fishermen?

09:47.583 --> 09:48.458
Hold on.

09:48.541 --> 09:52.541
Our goal is to survive
the summer, the nights, this job

09:53.333 --> 09:54.708
by buying an AC unit.

09:54.791 --> 09:56.500
But I just made one.

09:59.666 --> 10:01.291
Great.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.875
Okay, I know it's tough.
But this is serious.

10:06.375 --> 10:09.125
They were expelled
from the island we work on.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.875
It's hard to come to work every day.
Maresia doesn't care.

10:13.833 --> 10:14.916
It could be us.

10:18.291 --> 10:21.875
Yeah, but it's hard to sleep in this heat.

10:22.375 --> 10:25.666
We can't sleep well, work well.
We're not productive.

10:26.416 --> 10:29.666
If you want, I can sell this in one day.

10:30.791 --> 10:34.875
Okay. The most democratic thing is
to take a vote, right?

10:36.291 --> 10:37.125
Right, Miguel?

10:37.875 --> 10:39.208
-What?
-To take a vote.

10:40.166 --> 10:41.916
Yeah, let's vote.

10:42.416 --> 10:43.500
Sure.

10:45.791 --> 10:48.625
Raise your hand
if you want to buy an AC unit.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.125
All right, guys.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.833
It's easier to pretend
nothing is happening.

11:10.791 --> 11:11.916
It's so hot, right?

11:20.708 --> 11:23.625
#TheIslandBelongsToThePeople

11:27.333 --> 11:30.583
Conrado, tonight is our grand opening.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.458
-Are you singing with me?
-No.

11:34.541 --> 11:36.625
I wanted to, but it's not my thing.

11:36.708 --> 11:40.500
By the way, I need your help. Cool?

11:48.166 --> 11:49.666
What do we have here?

11:50.625 --> 11:54.666
I mixed some weed I had left
with mint and cilantro.

11:54.750 --> 11:55.583
<i>Voilà!</i>

11:56.083 --> 11:59.083
Now, I need your innocent look,

12:00.625 --> 12:03.583
your nerdy face,

12:03.666 --> 12:05.458
and the final touch…

12:10.375 --> 12:13.916
That's what I'm talking about.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.750
What are you talking about?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.541
This is our Bossa Blend.

12:23.375 --> 12:27.083
A mixture of herbs grown
in the purple soil of Petrópolis.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.666
The imperial city.

12:30.333 --> 12:35.583
And its genetic base
encompasses a flowering variety,

12:35.666 --> 12:39.291
with citrus tones
and a very high THC level.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.916
-Right.
-Right, indeed.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.708
Do you think I'd sell you crap?

12:46.791 --> 12:49.791
-How long have you known me?
-I think it's good.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.458
The taste is great.

12:52.541 --> 12:53.500
Of course.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.333
Okay, then.

12:59.416 --> 13:00.916
-It's fruity.
-Really?

13:08.666 --> 13:09.875
Now,

13:11.083 --> 13:11.958
smoke with us.

13:27.666 --> 13:28.500
Hit it.

13:31.208 --> 13:32.125
Nice vibe.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.125
-Come on, man.
-Come on!

13:35.208 --> 13:37.833
-Sure. Bossa Blend.
-Here.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.583
-Go, man.
-This is--

13:41.166 --> 13:42.375
This is good stuff.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.833
I get high.

13:45.708 --> 13:48.458
-I can see it. Go for it.
-I get really high.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.666
What are you doing, man? Easy.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.625
He inhaled too much.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.750
Burn it!

14:06.833 --> 14:13.375
Burn it!

14:20.833 --> 14:22.250
Welcome back.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.750
-Did you enjoy the ride?
-It was awesome.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.125
Thank you.

14:27.208 --> 14:29.875
It's important to rest
and get hydrated, okay?

14:29.958 --> 14:31.750
-See you later.
-Thank you.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.541
I'll see you in class.

14:34.625 --> 14:35.458
All right.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.208
-My class is ruined!
-Why?

14:39.291 --> 14:40.833
You tired them out.

14:40.916 --> 14:42.833
In the first "om", they'll be asleep.

14:42.916 --> 14:47.083
I doubt they have the courage
to provoke Ms. "Namastension."

14:47.166 --> 14:48.708
But you do, right?

14:48.791 --> 14:51.750
I've got a buyer!

14:51.833 --> 14:54.875
-That's great.
-So soon? You're fast.

14:54.958 --> 14:56.541
I've got contacts in Floripa.

14:57.166 --> 14:59.625
Diego is going there, too. Go with him.

14:59.708 --> 15:00.791
-Now?
-No!

15:02.208 --> 15:03.416
It'll be a bit hectic.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.708
It's up to you.
You're the ones sleeping in the heat.

15:07.791 --> 15:08.875
I'll get to class.

15:09.791 --> 15:10.875
Have a good class.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.208
I'll get it.

15:17.958 --> 15:18.833
Front desk.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.458
Okay, I'm on my way.

15:24.416 --> 15:25.708
I'll meet you at the pier.

15:27.000 --> 15:27.833
Okay.

15:29.708 --> 15:31.541
Hey, gringo. Come here.

15:31.625 --> 15:35.291
Do you prefer "The Fight Goes On"
or "The Island Has Woken Up"?

15:37.083 --> 15:40.791
-What?
-The latter is better. I like it.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.125
Can I take everything?

16:13.750 --> 16:16.541
Listen, I wanted to apologize for earlier.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.500
They went too far.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.416
It hurts to see you like this.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.500
You know you can count on me, right?

16:50.250 --> 16:51.916
I pity you, Rodrigo.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.625
For having such an empty life.
All your friends are leeches.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.500
It must be awful.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.083
That's not my problem anymore.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.791
I'll ask someone to take this.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.333
Come on.

17:16.791 --> 17:19.250
-Leave me alone, please.
-What happened?

17:19.333 --> 17:21.125
Leave. I want to be alone.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.041
-What's the matter?
-Relax, man.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.125
-It's checkout time. Go home.
-Are you crazy?

17:26.208 --> 17:27.375
-Okay!
-Move it.

17:28.625 --> 17:30.208
You're crazy, man. Fuck this.

17:52.958 --> 17:55.750
What's happening, Conrado?
Are you all right?

17:56.625 --> 17:58.500
I'm thirsty. Very thirsty.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.583
-Thirsty. Okay.
-I'm nervous and stressed too.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.791
The devil is acting up.

18:09.666 --> 18:10.916
What's in this?

18:11.708 --> 18:15.333
It's sugar. Fruit. Do you want some more?

18:17.625 --> 18:18.500
It's good.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.166
Santiago, right?

18:35.708 --> 18:39.958
I love it. Dinner at the Bellavista,
ski in Valle Nevado.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.875
-Do you like it?
-I do.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.541
Don't you miss it?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.166
Not at all.

18:47.791 --> 18:50.000
This place is perfect.

18:57.000 --> 18:57.833
Need help?

18:58.541 --> 18:59.458
Yeah.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.000
<i>Gracias.</i>

19:05.666 --> 19:06.500
Welcome.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.208
This is my home now.

19:11.625 --> 19:12.625
Your home has

19:13.541 --> 19:14.458
a great view.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.916
What are you doing in Floripa?

19:19.958 --> 19:22.375
I have stuff from the past to sort out.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.375
But now, I'll help you sell the phone.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.458
The city is dangerous.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.333
It's all good, gringo.
I can take care of myself.

19:51.125 --> 19:53.666
<i>Tell me what you want</i>

19:53.750 --> 19:54.666
Say it!

19:55.208 --> 19:57.916
<i>This is not the last round</i>

19:58.000 --> 20:00.708
<i>Last night, I dreamed</i>

20:00.791 --> 20:04.791
<i>We were in the shower</i>
<i>Doing silly things</i>

20:04.875 --> 20:05.916
<i>Say it, Brazil</i>

20:06.000 --> 20:09.541
<i>Get down, get up</i>
<i>Go smooth</i>

20:09.625 --> 20:13.125
<i>Get it all soaped up</i>

20:13.208 --> 20:16.875
<i>Get down, get up</i>
<i>Go smooth</i>

20:16.958 --> 20:20.416
<i>Shake that booty and show me</i>

20:23.041 --> 20:25.125
I want you, Conrado!

20:25.208 --> 20:28.208
-Come to Team Helena!
-Thank you, Brazil!

20:28.291 --> 20:29.625
Cool!

20:29.708 --> 20:31.875
-Oh my God! Crap!
-Oh God. Damn.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.541
-It was you.
-Hold on. Let's stop now.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.833
If Vilma sees us like this,
we'll be in trouble.

20:37.916 --> 20:42.375
I need two sake drinks at the beach
to the guest in room 11.

20:43.833 --> 20:45.875
-Hi.
-Yasmin, I missed you!

20:47.208 --> 20:48.958
What happened to him?

20:49.458 --> 20:51.375
Heatstroke, I don't know.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.333
I missed you.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.291
Did you see the post
I shared with the group?

20:56.916 --> 20:59.916
Girl, we can't talk right now.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.791
-Later, I promise. I'm sorry.
-All right, I'll get to work.

21:04.541 --> 21:05.875
<i>Get up, get down</i>

21:05.958 --> 21:08.083
-Enough.
-Where are you going?

21:08.166 --> 21:11.541
-Good luck.
-We need to work, too.

21:19.291 --> 21:22.541
-Look at this. We scored.
-Totally.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.875
Look! Awesome.

21:25.833 --> 21:28.041
Cool. Put that away.

21:28.125 --> 21:30.208
-What?
-Put it away, it's dangerous.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.375
What? Don't I have a bodyguard?

21:43.083 --> 21:45.250
RESTAURANT CLOSED

21:46.750 --> 21:48.416
Here, drink some water.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.583
Do you know what I--

22:03.625 --> 22:05.458
I mean,

22:06.041 --> 22:08.833
I always pretended
to understand, but I don't?

22:09.958 --> 22:11.208
The Holy Trinity.

22:11.708 --> 22:12.541
Really?

22:13.625 --> 22:15.250
How can one thing

22:16.625 --> 22:17.916
be three?

22:19.875 --> 22:20.875
There's no way.

22:20.958 --> 22:21.791
Look at this.

22:22.583 --> 22:24.500
Look at the sky, look at…

22:26.500 --> 22:29.375
the air, the ocean. Look at all this.

22:31.333 --> 22:34.000
I love your <i>The</i> <i>Sound of Music</i> vibe.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.791
Singing, dancing…

22:37.916 --> 22:38.958
and being free.

23:00.291 --> 23:01.125
Yeah.

23:02.333 --> 23:04.708
Tell me something, gringo.

23:04.791 --> 23:08.458
Didn't you say you had some things
from your past to sort out?

23:08.541 --> 23:10.541
I do. It's near here.

23:11.625 --> 23:12.458
So,

23:13.291 --> 23:14.125
go ahead.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.666
I have things about my future to sort out.

23:17.750 --> 23:18.750
-Really?
-Yes.

23:18.833 --> 23:19.958
-Now?
-Now.

23:21.416 --> 23:22.500
You're dismissed.

23:23.583 --> 23:27.500
-Okay, boss. See you later.
-Bye. I'll see you at the hotel.

23:27.583 --> 23:28.666
It was a pleasure.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.500
You're not enjoying this.

24:23.375 --> 24:24.250
What?

24:27.666 --> 24:28.500
I'm sorry.

24:29.583 --> 24:30.541
I don't know.

24:32.250 --> 24:36.500
This hotel-- One day, my parents are here,
the next, I'm selling drugs,

24:36.583 --> 24:39.083
doing my nails, and now I'm here with you.

24:41.500 --> 24:44.125
-Wow. I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

24:44.208 --> 24:46.125
-I'm truly sorry.
-It's fine.

24:47.416 --> 24:48.958
Don't be hard on yourself.

25:05.416 --> 25:06.250
Yasmin!

25:06.875 --> 25:09.125
I saw your post on the hotel profile.

25:10.083 --> 25:13.916
Who sold you the weed you smoked?
I don't want any competition.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.833
You're the one tripping, Miguel.

25:15.916 --> 25:18.708
Sometimes, I think
I'm the most clearheaded person here.

25:18.791 --> 25:21.916
I've already told you
the rules in Miguel Land.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.500
-It's best to fly under the radar.
-For whom?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.458
-For Maresia?
-Yasmin.

25:28.291 --> 25:30.166
I need to have a word with you.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.208
I'll take care of it.

25:39.166 --> 25:44.166
Yasmin, I hate to do this, especially
with someone with such potential,

25:44.250 --> 25:46.083
but you gave me no choice.

25:49.541 --> 25:52.333
It's fine. I was on my way out.

25:52.416 --> 25:53.333
Excuse me.

26:02.208 --> 26:04.625
Hey. Did something happen?

26:04.708 --> 26:05.708
Hey, bro.

26:06.666 --> 26:07.500
You want some?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.625
No, I've got a shift at the bar.

26:10.708 --> 26:14.083
Since when is that a problem? Have a seat.

26:14.583 --> 26:18.041
Let's play some video game.
Enjoy the AC here, it's hot outside.

26:18.541 --> 26:19.375
Come on.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.333
-Just the video game.
-That was easy.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.250
I'll kick your ass.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.916
PRESS ANY BUTTON

26:36.958 --> 26:39.500
Look at that perfect cutback!

26:39.583 --> 26:41.583
Where's your swing? You're weak.

26:41.666 --> 26:44.416
Enjoy it. In real life, you're lame.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.791
Right. Look.

26:45.875 --> 26:49.791
In the game, I can have the board
and everything you have,

26:49.875 --> 26:52.750
and I win all of them. Look!

26:53.916 --> 26:56.916
Where is daddy's trophy
for this beautiful victory?

26:57.000 --> 26:59.541
-Say, "You're the best."
-Two out of three.

26:59.625 --> 27:02.625
I won't say anything
until you win two out of three.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.250
Catarina.

27:16.166 --> 27:18.458
I'm sorry to make you wait, dear.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.208
But now,

27:21.375 --> 27:22.291
I'm all ears.

27:24.541 --> 27:27.708
You look great.
Conchas Island is being good for you.

27:28.208 --> 27:29.541
Thanks, Uncle.

27:29.625 --> 27:32.458
Any news from my mother?
When can I see her?

27:32.541 --> 27:35.916
It'll take a while.
Your mother's schedule is full.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.291
Procurators, me, papers to sign,
pissed-off clients--

27:40.375 --> 27:42.750
Bless her heart, she's busy.

27:44.166 --> 27:45.541
But I have good news.

27:46.541 --> 27:49.291
Remember the money
for your MBA in Switzerland?

27:49.375 --> 27:51.458
-The IRS didn't seize that.
-Really?

27:52.333 --> 27:53.333
That's great.

27:53.416 --> 27:57.666
But, unfortunately,
other arrangements had to be made.

27:57.750 --> 27:58.958
What arrangements?

27:59.041 --> 28:01.750
Look, I know you call me uncle,

28:02.458 --> 28:06.583
but I'm providing a service
to your mother, and it has a cost.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.500
My fees are late.

28:09.583 --> 28:12.791
Not to mention the filing fees.
You know how it is.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.583
-Did my mother authorize that?
-Yes.

28:21.541 --> 28:24.666
Well, you had no good news for me, then.

28:24.750 --> 28:25.958
Nobody has.

28:26.041 --> 28:28.125
See how practical your mother is?

28:28.666 --> 28:30.125
She always says,

28:30.208 --> 28:34.125
"There's a right way to do things,
and there's a way that works."

28:35.208 --> 28:36.500
You're like your mom.

28:36.583 --> 28:40.958
You'll figure out some way
to make things work.

28:46.666 --> 28:48.250
Brag now!

28:48.333 --> 28:50.666
Brag now!

28:50.750 --> 28:54.000
-Tell me, who's the king? Is it Ro?
-Hold on, man.

28:54.083 --> 28:57.750
-It's Ro!
-Wait!

28:58.791 --> 29:00.791
-Damn, Rodrigo.
-Sorry, man.

29:00.875 --> 29:05.125
I miss when we were kids
and played video games all day long.

29:08.083 --> 29:10.666
I'm tired of hanging out
with those idiots.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.625
They can't tell a real joint
from one made of oregano.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.291
Who told you to change providers?

29:17.791 --> 29:20.916
You're my provider.
Oregano joints are your trademark.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.333
Gimme some time.
I'll give you your money back.

29:29.416 --> 29:32.250
No, Miguel! Come on, look at me.

29:33.916 --> 29:36.166
Stop. Don't freak out again.

29:36.250 --> 29:37.375
The money is yours.

29:37.958 --> 29:40.500
You need it more than I do. Relax.

29:43.291 --> 29:44.125
Thanks.

29:47.958 --> 29:48.791
Thanks.

29:52.208 --> 29:53.041
Thanks.

30:01.041 --> 30:02.125
What a day.

30:04.083 --> 30:05.791
We need to talk about Yasmin.

30:07.083 --> 30:07.958
We do.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.625
I'm glad you agree,
because we broke a record.

30:12.125 --> 30:13.250
What record?

30:13.333 --> 30:15.708
How quick we fire someone.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.500
Who got fired?

30:19.625 --> 30:21.625
Don't look at me like that, Maresia.

30:22.125 --> 30:24.041
She practically begged to be fired.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.458
-Did you see her post?
-Where's Yasmin?

30:26.541 --> 30:28.833
What happened?

30:28.916 --> 30:30.708
-Where's Yasmin?
-What happened?

30:30.791 --> 30:31.666
Where is she?

30:31.750 --> 30:34.250
I don't know, at the pier. Why? Calm down!

30:34.750 --> 30:36.666
Maresia, what happened?

30:37.291 --> 30:38.958
She said she is

30:39.666 --> 30:40.666
my daughter.

30:57.625 --> 31:00.291
I've never seen anyone
leave this paradise so fast.

31:00.375 --> 31:04.166
Yeah, Mr. Dimas.
Paradise for some, hell for others.

31:05.250 --> 31:08.625
I've seen this movie before.
I don't need a rerun.

31:08.708 --> 31:09.625
Yasmin!

31:15.791 --> 31:18.416
I'm sorry. I was a jerk yesterday.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.125
Today, too.

31:21.166 --> 31:24.583
You can go if you want to,
but let me explain.

31:41.166 --> 31:44.583
Do you understand why I was so blown away?

31:45.125 --> 31:46.666
The subject of children

31:47.250 --> 31:49.166
is complicated with Vilma.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.375
She never wanted kids, we--

31:52.333 --> 31:54.208
Yeah, I noticed that.

31:54.708 --> 31:55.666
I did.

31:59.583 --> 32:02.625
I just don't get you, Maresia.

32:04.583 --> 32:07.583
I saw the graffiti the townspeople made.

32:08.833 --> 32:11.041
And I know about the eviction notice.

32:11.541 --> 32:14.625
People are losing their homes
because of your hotel.

32:14.708 --> 32:16.375
I thought, "Is that my dad?"

32:16.916 --> 32:19.375
"The jerk who doesn't care about anyone?"

32:19.458 --> 32:20.416
But I do care.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.666
It's a complicated issue.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.791
Everything is complicated for you.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.500
No. This subject is.

32:29.416 --> 32:32.541
You just got here.
You don't know what's going on.

32:33.041 --> 32:34.916
Stay, so you can understand.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.166
I think it's great that you're worried
about the fishermen.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.458
I was the same at your age.

32:41.541 --> 32:43.208
-I had this--
-The same?

32:43.291 --> 32:46.625
-The same!
-Were you a Black woman from the ghetto?

32:54.916 --> 32:56.333
Okay, I wasn't the same.

32:57.125 --> 32:58.041
You're right.

33:00.125 --> 33:03.250
-We come from different worlds.
-Yes.

33:06.041 --> 33:07.583
And I think it'll be great

33:08.750 --> 33:13.375
if we try to bring those worlds closer.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.333
Stay a bit longer.

33:17.958 --> 33:18.916
Just a bit.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.458
I didn't even know what I was doing.

33:26.541 --> 33:27.833
I have nowhere to go.

33:28.333 --> 33:31.333
I need my first paycheck to leave.

33:31.416 --> 33:34.125
So stay a month and get that paycheck.

33:35.250 --> 33:38.416
I think that if you stay a month,
you'll want to stay longer.

33:39.166 --> 33:40.000
I bet.

33:41.458 --> 33:43.458
-Wanna bet money on it?
-I do.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.250
Okay, then.

33:55.916 --> 33:57.375
Yeah. Thank you.

33:58.458 --> 34:03.125
It's very special that you reminded me

34:04.583 --> 34:06.708
that being on the fence

34:07.958 --> 34:09.500
is not me at all.

34:11.833 --> 34:12.666
I'm glad.

34:13.875 --> 34:15.666
If you care, you pick a side.

34:16.833 --> 34:17.708
See you.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.875
-Cool.
-Cool.

34:32.750 --> 34:33.708
Look.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.833
What's that, man?
Did you just steal my ice cube?

34:44.916 --> 34:47.250
In this heat, ice cubes have no owners.

34:47.333 --> 34:48.958
-I see.
-Tell me something.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.833
How did you not get fired?

34:51.416 --> 34:53.791
Let's say I'm giving this place a chance.

34:55.166 --> 34:56.791
I talked to Maresia.

34:58.083 --> 35:01.000
He decided to own up to a few things.

35:01.958 --> 35:05.125
I think you're too tough on him.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.958
You should take it easy.

35:07.583 --> 35:10.291
There's something about Maresia
I wanted to tell you--

35:10.375 --> 35:12.541
It was awful!

35:13.875 --> 35:14.708
Catarina?

35:14.791 --> 35:16.416
What happened? You're pale!

35:16.500 --> 35:19.500
They took everything!
I was mugged on my way back.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.583
-What?
-They took everything!

35:21.666 --> 35:22.666
Are you okay?

35:22.750 --> 35:23.958
I'll get some water.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.875
-Did they hurt you?
-No.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.750
But they took the money
we got for the phone.

35:29.833 --> 35:31.708
-Everything I had.
-Don't worry.

35:31.791 --> 35:33.333
-You're fine.
-It's okay.

35:33.416 --> 35:35.291
-Drink this.
-Breathe, Catarina.

35:35.375 --> 35:38.666
It was too fast, I couldn't react.

35:38.750 --> 35:39.583
You know?

35:40.708 --> 35:42.541
-We got you.
-I was so stupid!

35:42.625 --> 35:45.125
-Don't worry.
-We're glad you're okay.

36:05.375 --> 36:06.625
I didn't know.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.625
Her mother never told me anything.
I had no idea.

36:14.541 --> 36:16.333
It was before we met.

36:19.125 --> 36:20.625
And she told you last night?

36:20.708 --> 36:24.333
One second before you walked in.
That's why I was stunned.

36:25.375 --> 36:27.250
Haven't you spoken to her since?

36:27.333 --> 36:29.125
I wanted to talk to you first.

36:29.625 --> 36:30.958
But I couldn't.

36:33.958 --> 36:36.458
Now I understand
why she was behaving like that.

36:38.375 --> 36:40.500
She waited all day for an answer.

36:40.583 --> 36:41.958
Yes, it's my fault.

36:42.041 --> 36:45.416
I didn't know how you'd react.

36:46.125 --> 36:48.083
We fight when we talk about kids.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.375
-That issue is solved.
-It was solved.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.375
-It is solved.
-It was before the girl showed up.

37:00.583 --> 37:03.333
I know you always pretended

37:04.125 --> 37:07.083
you didn't want kids because of me.

37:09.375 --> 37:11.291
I've never thanked you for that.

37:12.875 --> 37:15.041
This is very hard for me.

37:15.625 --> 37:19.041
This girl showing up is very special.

37:20.250 --> 37:24.208
I want to see,
I need to see where this goes.

37:25.916 --> 37:28.083
But not without you by my side.

37:30.500 --> 37:31.583
Help me with this.

37:36.541 --> 37:38.333
I can't promise you anything.

37:40.333 --> 37:41.500
But I will try.

37:48.666 --> 37:52.458
Someone who smells great
owes me information on Maresia.

37:53.708 --> 37:54.541
So,

37:55.458 --> 37:58.375
he has nothing to do
with the hotel's expansion.

37:59.125 --> 38:02.333
Elias, who's a partner
and Rodrigo's father, owns the spa.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.541
-He's the one who evicted everyone.
-Really?

38:07.041 --> 38:10.750
Yeah. Thanks to Maresia,
some people still live in the village.

38:11.625 --> 38:12.458
Like who?

38:13.916 --> 38:16.875
People who have no means to leave.

38:17.750 --> 38:18.583
Like me.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.458
You're here. I thought you had left.

38:38.541 --> 38:41.083
Not before kissing you.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.000
I have news for you.

38:46.583 --> 38:48.041
What are you up to?

38:48.125 --> 38:49.083
Look at this.

38:53.333 --> 38:54.166
Hey.

38:56.791 --> 38:59.791
-Application for a lifeguard job?
-Yes, a lifeguard.

39:00.291 --> 39:01.333
Okay, but--

39:01.833 --> 39:03.000
What's this, Diego?

39:03.583 --> 39:07.125
You're always talking about dreams,
owning your studio.

39:07.958 --> 39:11.208
Yes, having my own business,
being an independent woman.

39:11.291 --> 39:14.416
It's completely different.
This is not being independent.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.500
What? Didn't you like it?

39:16.583 --> 39:20.041
I just thought you wanted
something better for yourself.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.875
A career, money, future.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.208
This is the career I want.

39:32.583 --> 39:35.166
I'm sorry, Diego. I'm sorry.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.916
My mind is on Sofia,
I need to pick her up.

39:39.833 --> 39:40.666
I'm sorry.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.458
-I'll go to the lodge.
-Okay.

39:44.250 --> 39:45.083
Come on.

39:48.291 --> 39:49.875
-Hey.
-Hi.

39:50.416 --> 39:51.458
Welcome.

39:54.458 --> 39:55.291
I'm sorry.

39:56.208 --> 39:58.458
-I didn't know.
-Don't worry.

39:58.541 --> 39:59.958
I'm sorry, too.

40:00.041 --> 40:02.416
I didn't have to behave like that.

40:02.916 --> 40:03.750
I'm sorry.

40:03.833 --> 40:06.208
Could we have a new start?

40:08.500 --> 40:09.791
Welcome to our house.

40:11.166 --> 40:12.666
Welcome to our staff.

40:13.416 --> 40:16.125
Your pictures are great,
but leave the posting to me.

40:16.208 --> 40:17.208
All right.

40:17.791 --> 40:20.875
Come here, we want to show you something.

40:28.541 --> 40:31.083
I started surfing with this board.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.875
If you like it,

40:35.750 --> 40:36.875
you can borrow it.

40:38.416 --> 40:40.333
And if you want,

40:41.666 --> 40:43.583
you can stay in this room.

40:45.416 --> 40:47.083
Wow, Maresia. This is…

40:48.166 --> 40:49.000
For you.

40:52.833 --> 40:54.625
I don't want to be ungrateful,

40:54.708 --> 40:59.500
but it'll be weird for the guys
to find out about it now.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.750
Do you understand?

41:03.208 --> 41:04.083
Sure.

41:04.166 --> 41:06.291
You can take your time.

41:07.458 --> 41:09.291
The room is not going anywhere.

41:11.875 --> 41:13.541
You're a cool dude, Maresia.

41:16.791 --> 41:18.875
I'd better go.

41:56.416 --> 41:57.458
<i>Diego!</i>

42:00.666 --> 42:01.750
<i>Diego…</i>

42:04.375 --> 42:05.583
<i>Diego!</i>

42:08.083 --> 42:09.166
<i>Diego, help me!</i>

42:09.666 --> 42:10.708
<i>Diego, help me!</i>

42:12.000 --> 42:13.125
<i>Diego!</i>

42:56.250 --> 42:58.416
I knew I shouldn't have left you.

42:59.083 --> 43:00.041
It was dangerous.

43:01.708 --> 43:02.875
Relax, Diego.

43:04.208 --> 43:05.541
It'd have happened anyway.

43:06.291 --> 43:07.125
No.

43:08.416 --> 43:10.500
I'm the best bodyguard in the area.

43:11.000 --> 43:11.958
Remember?

43:14.833 --> 43:16.708
Yeah, maybe.

43:21.250 --> 43:22.333
Beautiful night.

43:25.916 --> 43:26.750
Let's go back?

43:27.416 --> 43:29.208
Are you leaving because of me?

43:29.291 --> 43:31.416
-The couple can stay.
-Stop, Rodrigo.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.500
Gringo, she's fooling you, you know?

43:34.291 --> 43:38.375
The Peso is undervalued.
You'll need to work hard to buy her stuff.

43:38.458 --> 43:39.666
Don't let him get to you!

43:40.250 --> 43:43.458
Diego, let's go, please.

43:44.125 --> 43:46.125
Rodrigo! Are you insane?

43:46.208 --> 43:47.458
Leave, you jerk!

43:47.541 --> 43:48.750
-I know you.
-Let's go.

43:48.833 --> 43:51.500
-You can't live without money.
-Shut up!

43:51.583 --> 43:54.083
-You're just like your mother!
-Shut up!

44:09.666 --> 44:11.500
I'm leaving this fucking hotel.

44:42.958 --> 44:44.000
SURF LEAGUE

44:47.916 --> 44:51.458
YOUTH CHAMPION
RODRIGO AIRES AGUIAR

45:01.333 --> 45:04.708
When you throw a punch,
always leave your thumb outside the fist.

45:06.083 --> 45:06.916
Thanks.

45:29.625 --> 45:31.208
Wake up, princess.

45:32.750 --> 45:36.333
Remember what you said
about sharing toothpaste and all?

45:36.416 --> 45:38.541
I'm out. So I'm getting yours, okay?

45:44.291 --> 45:45.125
What?

45:49.333 --> 45:51.458
You were mugged and went shopping?
