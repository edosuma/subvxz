WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.440
He's doing it again.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.080
We will get Bren.
I promise you.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.320
Nikki's gone.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.800
If I get as much
as a fucking whisper

00:12.000 --> 00:13.520
that she's been blabbing
her mouth off,

00:13.640 --> 00:15.536
you'll be digging her up
in the Dublin Mountains.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.720
Fuck!

00:16.960 --> 00:18.416
The word is out
that Bren is hiring.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.720
What for?
Don't know.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.160
So it must be something big
he's planning.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.160
I'd watch your back
if I was you.

00:36.560 --> 00:37.640
I'll tell you what,

00:37.840 --> 00:39.456
I'll set you up with something
before I go.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.480
Go where?

00:40.481 --> 00:41.880
Somewhere nice.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.240
I want you to keep this

00:43.400 --> 00:45.080
just between you and me, okay?

00:45.280 --> 00:47.600
And don't you worry,
'cause I'll sort everything.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.360
- Did you get them?
- Yeah. Go, go, go.

00:53.560 --> 00:54.560
Watch, watch, watch!

00:54.800 --> 00:56.120
Fuck!

00:56.280 --> 00:58.800
Just fucking drive!

01:22.080 --> 01:23.440
What the fuck happened?!

01:23.640 --> 01:26.600
She came out from nowhere, Bren.
Right in front of the car.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.000
Nothing I could've done.
Is she gonna be okay?

01:30.200 --> 01:33.640
What do you fuckin' think?

01:33.880 --> 01:37.360
Get your clothes off.
Put them in there.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.496
The gun's in the car.
Do you want me to get that, too?

01:39.520 --> 01:41.280
No.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.400
Leave it there.
We'll put them in the crusher.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.840
Where's your change of clothes?

01:56.000 --> 01:57.520
On the bench.

01:57.720 --> 01:59.480
Go get dressed.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.960
Go on.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.240
Go on, Anthony.
Get his legs.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.880
I am not having you pay
for his fuck-up.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.800
There's only two people know
you were there tonight --

03:10.960 --> 03:14.360
you and me.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.240
You'll keep it that way.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.960
There's a lot of fuckin' snakes
in this family.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.400
Okay?

03:21.600 --> 03:22.680
Yeah.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.840
I've spoken to Eric
about what we're planning.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.000
And he's agreed to help us.
Why?

04:10.360 --> 04:13.680
Bren's been making threats
against Nikki.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.480
And I'm not fuckin' having that.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.080
Eric wants something in return.

04:18.280 --> 04:19.840
What?

04:20.040 --> 04:23.040
He wants to be allowed
to reopen the houses...

04:23.240 --> 04:25.080
run them himself.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.160
I want to be me own boss,
deal with things my way.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.040
He's part of this family.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.920
Having him look after retail
would be good. For everyone.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.640
Do you want me
to fuckin' help youse or not?

04:43.880 --> 04:47.360
You'd have to source everything
that you sell from us.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.320
That's the only way.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.680
Yeah. Okay.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.840
Okay.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.400
So?
When's it all happening?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.280
Tomorrow.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.480
You're fuckin' jokin'.

05:05.640 --> 05:06.960
Bren's hiring.

05:07.200 --> 05:10.520
The longer we wait,
the harder it will be to do.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.440
We need this done.
Quickly.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.440
You're doing the shooting.
I take it Jimmy's driving?

05:22.640 --> 05:25.280
We haven't spoken to Jimmy yet.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.400
Bren's Jimmy's dad, too.
He should know.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.880
I'm gonna talk to him.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.000
Look.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.000
What the fuck?

05:47.400 --> 05:49.800
Uh, can I fuckin' help you?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.880
Ah, Eric.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.280
- You know who Glenn Wright is?
- No.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.640
He's the lad who shot you
and Jamie last year.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.320
So?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.480
He was killed
earlier this evening.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.776
Let me know
if you catch whoever did it.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.880
I'll buy them a drink.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.520
Oh, we'll get them, alright.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.080
They knocked down a woman
when they were getting away.

06:15.320 --> 06:19.080
Don't look at me.
I was at Birdy's earlier.

06:19.320 --> 06:21.160
Came here together.
She'll vouch for that.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.200
Don't worry, Eric.

06:23.440 --> 06:26.800
We know exactly where you were.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.200
This was under the driver's side
of your car.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.800
And Wright had an app
on his phone.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.240
Following all
your movements on it.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.880
When he was shot,
he had a gun, gloves,

06:39.040 --> 06:41.080
and a balaclava
in the boot of his car.

06:41.320 --> 06:43.280
You were very lucky tonight,
Eric.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.160
Anthony.
Let's go inside.

07:09.400 --> 07:11.360
The boy who shot Jamie...

07:14.040 --> 07:15.640
was killed tonight.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.720
That's good. Isn't it?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.280
Come here, Anthony.

07:49.440 --> 07:50.720
Alright, Da.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.520
Here. Did you hear?
What?

07:53.720 --> 07:56.960
That cunt that shot Jamie.
Been killed.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.960
What?
Who fucking did it?

08:00.160 --> 08:01.520
Who gives a fuck?

08:01.720 --> 08:03.960
He's dead now.
That's all that matters.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.440
Here, John!
Bottle of champagne down here.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.840
We're celebrating.
That should have been me.

08:09.040 --> 08:12.040
I should have done it for Jamie.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.720
You had a whole fuckin' year
to do something about that.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.440
But you stood around
with your hand on your prick.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.960
So don't come shouting now

08:20.160 --> 08:22.240
because someone else
wiped your eye.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.640
Tonight's a good night, Jimmy.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.640
You should be celebratin'.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.320
We should have fuckin' done it.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.840
Here.
Go up and get that into you.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.240
I should've done it.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.800
Yes.

09:37.040 --> 09:39.600
Nuray, this is Amanda Kinsella.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.680
I know who it is.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.520
I just wanted to call you
and tell you how sorry I was

09:46.760 --> 09:49.240
to hear about
your father's death.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.680
Can only imagine how difficult

09:50.920 --> 09:53.320
the last couple of days
have been.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.920
Thank you.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.640
I'm sorry to have to bring up
business at this time,

10:00.920 --> 10:03.760
but there's something
I need to discuss with you.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.360
Hamza.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.360
Huh?

11:00.400 --> 11:01.800
Hm.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.520
Birdy!

12:11.280 --> 12:12.800
Birdy!

12:26.200 --> 12:27.200
Birdy!

12:28.880 --> 12:31.840
Let me in!
Go to bed, Brendan.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.440
Open the door.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.320
No, I-I'm sleeping!

12:35.520 --> 12:37.720
I only want to say hello!

12:37.920 --> 12:39.176
I'll talk to you in the morning.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.840
Ah, come on, Birdy.
Open up.

12:44.840 --> 12:48.360
I said fuckin' open up!

12:48.560 --> 12:50.600
Open up this fucking door!

12:50.840 --> 12:52.720
I have me phone here.
I'm ringin' Mikey.

12:52.920 --> 12:55.240
You think I give a fuck
about that?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.520
I'm ringin' him right now!

12:56.760 --> 12:59.400
Fuck Michael.
Fuck off!

12:59.600 --> 13:02.880
You fucking shower of cunts!

13:03.120 --> 13:05.600
I don't give a fuck
about Michael.

13:07.520 --> 13:10.520
I don't give a fuck
about any of youse!

13:10.680 --> 13:12.720
Fucking shower of cunts.

14:23.760 --> 14:26.040
I talked to Nuray.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.480
The Batuks are arriving today.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.840
I can handle them.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.960
You just talk to Jimmy.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.920
You sure?

14:40.520 --> 14:42.000
Yeah.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.800
Good luck.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.440
Yeah, you too.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.200
You hungry, Brendan?

15:24.400 --> 15:25.880
Starvin'.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.440
I had a few too many last night.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.960
Sit down.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.640
I'll make you a fry.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.280
That'd be lovely.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.320
Did you see Frank?

15:49.520 --> 15:51.680
Hm?

15:51.880 --> 15:54.280
You said you were going
to talk to him,

15:54.480 --> 15:57.640
put a stop
to all this God shite.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.360
Oh, I did, yeah.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.520
And?

16:02.800 --> 16:05.200
I talked to him.
It's gonna be grand.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.680
What did he say?

16:07.880 --> 16:12.080
He said he quit
all this God and mass stuff.

16:12.280 --> 16:15.360
He knows it's not on.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.080
Anything else?

16:17.280 --> 16:18.640
What do you mean?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.440
I mean, did he have
anything else interesting

16:21.640 --> 16:23.280
to say for himself?

16:24.880 --> 16:25.920
About what?

16:26.160 --> 16:28.840
I don't know.
You tell me.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.720
No.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.120
You like roast beef, don't you?

16:43.320 --> 16:45.280
I was thinking of
doing it on Sunday.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.120
Yeah. Yeah.
I'd like that.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.720
What's going on?

17:18.960 --> 17:22.800
I have a job.
For someone we can trust.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.520
What about Bren?

17:25.800 --> 17:27.240
He's not gonna know about this.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.800
Dublin's a small place.
Word gets around.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.720
Tell me how much you want
for two days' work.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.400
Look, I appreciate
you thinking of me,

17:34.560 --> 17:35.840
but I don't need the grief.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.040
60,000.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.600
For two days?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.320
20,000 bonus
if everything goes well.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.320
What do I need to do?

18:00.160 --> 18:01.920
You alright?

18:02.120 --> 18:04.440
Yeah.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.000
You can't have people
lying to you

18:07.240 --> 18:09.800
and sneaking around
behind your back.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.960
You've got to stamp it out.
No exceptions.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.840
I-I know that.
But it's fucking Frank.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.840
No fucking "buts" about it, son.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.880
This is what it is.
Right. Come on.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.000
Fuck it.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.360
Everything okay, Bren?

18:50.600 --> 18:53.640
Yeah.
Why wouldn't it be?

18:53.760 --> 18:55.960
Frank.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.480
So what's the story, Bren?

19:04.720 --> 19:07.160
If I'd have known
you wanted to talk to me,

19:07.400 --> 19:09.240
I would have called over
to the pub.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.720
Is there something wrong?

19:12.920 --> 19:14.320
You tell me.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.040
I don't think so.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.360
You sure about that, Frank?

19:23.560 --> 19:26.120
Yeah.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.800
'Cause I heard
you're leaving us.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.440
What do you mean?

19:31.680 --> 19:35.280
I mean I heard you're off
somewhere sunny, Frank.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.720
Somewhere sunny

19:36.920 --> 19:40.200
with lots of young tan boys
to suck your dick.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.080
Huh?
Is that the plan, Frank?

19:43.280 --> 19:44.880
Ugh!
For fuck's sake, Da.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.320
I asked you a fuckin' question.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.936
Bren, where are you
getting this from?!

19:47.960 --> 19:49.320
Don't fucking lie to me!

19:49.520 --> 19:51.240
Jesus Christ, Da!
What are you doing?!

19:51.480 --> 19:53.480
This is between me
and my brother.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.800
So you stay the fuck out of it.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.520
He's a fucking snake,

19:57.760 --> 20:00.000
running away
and betraying his family.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.000
That what you're doing,
Frank, is it?

20:02.200 --> 20:04.520
Huh? Running away?

20:06.280 --> 20:07.816
- Where's your passport?
- I don't know.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.680
Where?!

20:13.600 --> 20:16.200
I will beat you unconscious,
you cunt.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.400
I'm gonna tear
your fuckin' house apart.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.000
Now, where is that passport?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.280
In the desk.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.840
In a drawer in the office.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.800
What the fuck are you doing
with an office here?

20:29.440 --> 20:32.600
Go get that.
Go on!

20:32.760 --> 20:35.200
You fucker.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.080
Put that away.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.880
Or I'll cut your
fucking dick off with it.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.640
Da.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.520
Right. In future...
if you want to go somewhere,

20:58.760 --> 21:00.840
you come and see me and I decide

21:01.080 --> 21:02.440
whether you get that back
or not.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.160
Is that fuckin' clear?

21:05.320 --> 21:06.720
Come on, you.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.920
I'm sorry, Frank.

21:32.253 --> 21:35.253
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just a sec.

21:35.413 --> 21:36.773
Paul?

21:36.933 --> 21:39.613
I gotta call you back.

21:39.853 --> 21:41.493
Thought you'd be interested.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.773
Those bank details you found
are for a shell company

21:43.853 --> 21:45.093
registered in Dubai,

21:45.333 --> 21:47.773
and yesterday we had
our first activity in it.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.773
Please --
tell me it's the Kinsellas.

21:50.933 --> 21:52.853
Wayne Madigan.

21:53.093 --> 21:55.453
A large transfer arrived in
from an account linked to him

21:55.693 --> 21:57.893
that was then forwarded on
to the Central Bank of Syria.

21:57.933 --> 21:59.693
You report that?
Of course.

21:59.853 --> 22:01.333
What about the shell company?

22:01.613 --> 22:03.773
Can we link that to the
Kinsellas? Not so far.

22:03.973 --> 22:06.173
It's owned by another shell
company registered in London

22:06.253 --> 22:09.573
that's owned by another shell
and so on and so on.

22:09.813 --> 22:12.093
I know. This would have been
the icing on the cake.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.869
But with everything
we got on the dealership

22:13.893 --> 22:15.973
and her current businesses,
we have more than enough

22:16.213 --> 22:18.293
to make the money-laundering
charge stick.

22:24.333 --> 22:25.933
Let's pull the trigger.

22:37.773 --> 22:42.093
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Betty Duggan.

22:42.293 --> 22:43.693
That's her over there.

22:51.013 --> 22:52.933
Betty?

22:53.093 --> 22:55.533
Have you got a minute?

22:55.693 --> 22:57.853
Sure.

22:58.013 --> 23:00.973
In private.

23:01.173 --> 23:02.773
Won't take long.

23:08.093 --> 23:10.373
What can I do for you?

23:10.573 --> 23:13.293
I'm Eric Kinsella's auntie.

23:13.453 --> 23:16.013
If I call the Guards,
they'll be here in five minutes.

23:16.253 --> 23:19.773
I'm not here to hurt you
or threaten you.

23:19.973 --> 23:22.613
Your family
have been calling Jess

23:22.893 --> 23:24.293
and making vile threats.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.293
And that was wrong.
And I had no part of it.

23:26.533 --> 23:28.253
And I-I don't agree with it.

23:28.453 --> 23:30.613
So what do you want?

23:30.813 --> 23:33.173
Jess to rethink
what she's doing.

23:35.173 --> 23:40.293
Your nephew left
my granddaughter without a dad.

23:40.533 --> 23:43.093
And I'm not gonna pretend that
Eric is any kind of an angel,

23:43.253 --> 23:45.973
but neither was Kem.

23:47.573 --> 23:49.253
He was a drug dealer.
And a murderer.

23:49.453 --> 23:52.453
Of course
you're going to say that.

23:52.653 --> 23:54.933
You know that shooting last year
at the Vara supermarket?

23:55.093 --> 23:57.813
That was Kem.

23:58.053 --> 24:01.253
He set up his friend Fudge
to be killed.

24:01.493 --> 24:03.693
He organized the murder
of Gerard Delaney.

24:03.893 --> 24:05.693
You can google that.

24:07.213 --> 24:10.493
And he betrayed people
he shouldn't have betrayed.

24:10.693 --> 24:13.773
You think that justifies
what happened to him?

24:16.573 --> 24:19.213
Yeah. I do.

24:20.933 --> 24:22.453
Kem knew the rules.

24:24.173 --> 24:26.773
What's happening
with your Jess, though...

24:26.933 --> 24:29.613
that is not right.

24:29.853 --> 24:32.453
The Guards know
she's grieving and she's angry.

24:32.693 --> 24:35.813
They are using her
to get at my family.

24:38.013 --> 24:40.613
They don't care that she's --
she's gonna spend

24:40.933 --> 24:45.333
the rest of her life
in witness protection.

24:45.533 --> 24:47.013
They don't care
that she won't be able

24:47.133 --> 24:50.493
to see her friends or family...

24:50.693 --> 24:53.093
or that you and your husband
are gonna miss

24:53.293 --> 24:55.173
your granddaughter growing up.

24:55.373 --> 24:59.013
All those birthdays,
Christmases,

24:59.253 --> 25:05.453
special occasions that you
won't get to spend with Jess...

25:05.613 --> 25:07.333
or Chloe.

25:09.133 --> 25:12.173
Your family would pay
a very high price. And for what?

25:14.973 --> 25:18.453
Jess' statement
is all they have.

25:19.693 --> 25:21.693
Might not even be enough
to take it to court.

25:21.933 --> 25:23.973
The whole thing's crazy.

25:26.933 --> 25:29.013
Jess and Nikita
aren't criminals.

25:29.213 --> 25:30.933
They should be kept out of this.

25:31.173 --> 25:33.413
- Betty.
- Just give me a minute, Paul.

25:38.173 --> 25:41.413
I can see you're very busy.

25:41.613 --> 25:43.413
I won't hold you up any longer.

25:46.013 --> 25:50.853
Tell Jess if she withdraws
her statement,

25:51.093 --> 25:53.653
she can return home
with no fear for her safety.

25:56.573 --> 25:58.293
You have my word on it.

26:08.853 --> 26:10.773
Nice meetin' you.

26:38.133 --> 26:40.573
Well? What'd she say?

26:40.733 --> 26:42.213
Nothing.

26:43.613 --> 26:45.293
For fuck's sake.

26:45.453 --> 26:46.933
No.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.613
Just means
she's thinking about it.

26:52.013 --> 26:54.453
I've got a good feeling
about this.

26:54.653 --> 26:56.053
You think so?

26:56.213 --> 26:58.693
Yeah. Trust me.

27:02.573 --> 27:04.253
Thanks, Birdy.

27:13.653 --> 27:15.093
I have a bit of business
to do here.

27:15.293 --> 27:16.653
You can go.

27:23.013 --> 27:24.453
Hey, Bren.

27:24.653 --> 27:26.533
- Got some lobster meat?
- Yeah.

28:07.653 --> 28:09.453
You, uh --
You want a beer?

28:09.653 --> 28:12.093
I know it's serious
if you're offering me a drink

28:12.293 --> 28:15.333
in the middle of the day.

28:15.533 --> 28:18.213
Yeah. There's some stuff
I need to talk to you about.

28:20.413 --> 28:22.173
Now I am worried.

28:24.293 --> 28:26.613
Spit it out, Michael.

28:26.853 --> 28:28.893
Da's a problem.
He has to go.

28:29.093 --> 28:30.653
"Go"?
Hm.

28:34.813 --> 28:37.053
It's gonna be you?

28:37.213 --> 28:39.653
Yeah.

28:39.933 --> 28:42.013
I suppose you're doing this
for Amanda, yeah?

28:42.173 --> 28:45.613
And Eric. And Birdy.

28:45.893 --> 28:48.533
And I'm sure Frank will be
on board if we asked him.

28:52.013 --> 28:54.413
What exactly has Da done?

28:54.653 --> 28:56.973
He's destroying everything.

28:57.133 --> 28:58.293
Let me get this right.

28:58.493 --> 29:00.413
You're gonna kill Da
'cause he's a fucking prick?

29:00.453 --> 29:02.429
Ah, it's a little bit more than
that, though, Jimmy, isn't it?

29:02.453 --> 29:05.933
I mean, look at the shit
he's caused since he got out.

29:06.173 --> 29:08.293
He hurts people.
It's what he does.

29:08.533 --> 29:10.333
Why are you even
telling me this?

29:10.573 --> 29:11.893
'Cause you have a right to know.

29:12.093 --> 29:13.573
Uh-huh.

29:13.773 --> 29:15.693
Could use your help.

29:17.053 --> 29:19.573
No. Fuck you, man.

29:19.813 --> 29:21.053
Okay.
He's our fucking Da.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.133
All I'm asking you to do
is drive a car.

29:23.293 --> 29:25.253
I said no!

29:25.453 --> 29:26.533
You're putting me

29:26.773 --> 29:28.069
in a real difficult position
here, Michael.

29:28.093 --> 29:29.709
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with this now?

29:29.733 --> 29:31.429
I can't stop you warning him,
but I'm doing it either way,

29:31.453 --> 29:32.613
so I thought you should know.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.549
Da doesn't deserve this,
not for what he's done.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.813
He's been sniffing around Anna,
too.

29:39.253 --> 29:40.973
And I can't have that.

29:44.013 --> 29:45.893
What's that supposed to mean?

29:46.053 --> 29:47.853
You know what it means.

29:53.133 --> 29:54.893
He's not a fucking paedo.

29:57.053 --> 29:58.453
Michael.

30:02.733 --> 30:05.213
He's not a fucking paedo.

30:11.973 --> 30:13.973
You're just making up shit.
You're making up shit

30:14.213 --> 30:15.493
to justify what you're doing.

30:15.733 --> 30:18.013
Why do you think Mam left?

30:21.373 --> 30:23.173
She was protecting
little Jenny from him.

30:23.373 --> 30:24.973
Bollocks!
Why would I make that up?

30:25.173 --> 30:26.533
To get me to fucking help you!

30:26.733 --> 30:29.853
You know I'd never do that.

30:30.053 --> 30:32.493
You don't believe me, ask Birdy.

30:32.653 --> 30:35.493
She helped them.
She helped them disappear.

30:39.493 --> 30:41.213
Ask her.
She knows the truth.

30:45.813 --> 30:47.773
How long have you known?

30:49.613 --> 30:51.213
Always.

30:57.293 --> 30:59.349
I don't believe you. I don't
fucking believe you. Fine.

30:59.373 --> 31:00.813
That's 'cause
he was easier on you.

31:01.053 --> 31:02.749
He didn't come after you like
he did with me and Jenny.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.029
I always tried to stand up for
you, both of you. You know that.

31:05.053 --> 31:07.133
I know that. And I'm not
blaming you for any of this.

31:07.253 --> 31:09.893
Why didn't you tell me
what was going on? Why?

31:10.133 --> 31:12.693
So I could fucking help you!

31:14.493 --> 31:15.933
Help me now.

32:52.733 --> 32:54.093
You did the right thing.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.549
You never would have been
in charge

32:55.573 --> 32:59.013
with him there, undermining you.

32:59.213 --> 33:02.013
This is better for both of us.

33:53.903 --> 33:56.663
A business partnership
benefits both our families.

33:56.903 --> 33:59.543
If we're partners,
we'll give you 5%

33:59.783 --> 34:04.383
of our annual profits
in perpetuity.

34:04.623 --> 34:08.823
That will mean hundreds
of millions for your family.

34:09.023 --> 34:11.943
What about this Wayne Madigan?

34:12.183 --> 34:13.543
Is he going to be a problem?

34:13.783 --> 34:15.623
I know he's transferred money
for drugs

34:15.823 --> 34:17.783
to the Syrian Central Bank.

34:17.943 --> 34:20.703
That kind of transaction gets
flagged to Europol and the FBI,

34:20.903 --> 34:24.623
so I don't think
he'll trouble us anymore.

34:24.903 --> 34:26.783
Don't you ever
get tired of this?

34:30.223 --> 34:32.183
No.

34:32.383 --> 34:33.983
Because I'm good at it.

34:36.103 --> 34:37.903
And I like that.

34:39.743 --> 34:43.183
But I am gonna
have a baby, so...

34:45.223 --> 34:47.103
that might change everything.

35:11.903 --> 35:13.423
Yeah, I meant to leave
the Teddy there,

35:13.463 --> 35:14.823
where Glen was killed.

35:15.063 --> 35:16.279
I think I just seen
Anthony Kinsella

35:16.303 --> 35:18.903
at Angela's vigil.

35:19.063 --> 35:21.503
Why would he be there?

35:21.703 --> 35:23.903
That's what I thought.

35:24.103 --> 35:26.583
- Did you hear that, Ma?
- You sure it was him?

35:26.743 --> 35:28.263
Yeah.

35:41.463 --> 35:43.223
What's the problem?

35:43.343 --> 35:44.863
Where are the tablets now?

35:45.103 --> 35:47.303
My colleagues are sending them
from Birmingham tomorrow.

35:47.543 --> 35:48.783
Tell them to stop the shipment.

35:48.983 --> 35:50.463
This has all been arranged.

35:50.663 --> 35:53.263
I have a friend in the Guards,
and he says they know

35:53.503 --> 35:55.503
about the payment I made
for those tablets.

35:55.743 --> 35:57.663
I don't understand.
How could that have happened?

35:57.903 --> 36:00.583
Because they tried to fuck us!

36:00.823 --> 36:03.063
The account I put it into
was being monitored.

36:03.303 --> 36:06.063
The Kinsellas
had me use that account

36:06.303 --> 36:08.663
but paid for their own half
in cash.

36:08.903 --> 36:11.343
They were setting us up.

36:11.503 --> 36:13.543
But now we know.

36:13.743 --> 36:15.863
We can do something about it.

36:39.903 --> 36:43.023
Your phones.
Eric has the number.

36:43.223 --> 36:46.863
He'll text you when he gets
to the pub when he sees Bren.

36:47.103 --> 36:48.943
You let him know
when you're five minutes away.

36:48.983 --> 36:51.103
He'll bring him in the front.

36:51.303 --> 36:52.983
Okay.

36:53.143 --> 36:54.783
Got everything else?

36:54.943 --> 36:56.423
Yeah.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.423
You're doing this for Jenny.

37:05.063 --> 37:06.623
And you, Birdy.

37:43.343 --> 37:44.783
Frank!

37:49.263 --> 37:51.263
Frank!

37:51.423 --> 37:53.023
Frank!

38:04.263 --> 38:05.823
Fuck's sake, Frank,
what happened?

38:05.983 --> 38:07.103
Did you tell him?

38:09.223 --> 38:11.343
Who?
Bren.

38:11.583 --> 38:13.383
Did you fucking tell him?

38:15.503 --> 38:17.119
Look, Frank,
I didn't know he was gonna --

38:17.143 --> 38:20.063
You ever come around here again,
I will fucking kill you.

38:20.303 --> 38:22.903
- Frank.
- Shut the fuck up!

38:26.543 --> 38:29.903
I'm going upstairs now,
and I'm getting a gun.

38:30.103 --> 38:31.703
Don't be here when I come back.

38:33.583 --> 38:37.223
I trusted you.
I fucking trusted you!

39:14.343 --> 39:16.503
Nikki! Nikki.

39:16.783 --> 39:18.479
She doesn't want
to talk to you, Eric!

39:18.503 --> 39:20.143
Nikki.

39:20.343 --> 39:21.879
Don't worry.
I'm just taking what's mine.

39:21.903 --> 39:23.439
You can take what you want.
I don't care.

39:23.463 --> 39:25.823
Eric, I have to go.

39:26.023 --> 39:29.383
You see that lad
who was shot last night?

39:29.583 --> 39:31.423
He was on his way over
to kill me.

39:31.663 --> 39:33.583
The Guards found a tracker
on my car.

39:33.783 --> 39:35.223
He had a gun and a bally,

39:35.503 --> 39:37.543
and he was on his way
to get me when he was clipped.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.063
When I heard how close
I was to dying,

39:39.103 --> 39:40.263
all I could think of was you.

39:40.463 --> 39:42.063
Eric, will you just stop?
I swear to God.

39:42.103 --> 39:45.543
Just you. Nothing else.

39:45.743 --> 39:50.183
Look. You're not gonna change
my mind about any of this.

39:50.423 --> 39:52.303
Give us some fucking privacy,
will ya?

39:57.143 --> 39:58.343
Look.

39:58.543 --> 40:01.103
I know I fucked up.
Okay?

40:01.263 --> 40:02.543
But I can fix this.

40:02.743 --> 40:04.863
It's too late.
It's not too late.

40:05.143 --> 40:06.943
I'm getting
your charges dropped.

40:07.143 --> 40:10.263
And no one's getting hurt.

40:10.503 --> 40:15.383
Birdy spoke to Jess' mam.
It's all gonna be fine.

40:15.623 --> 40:18.063
And I'm done with Bren.
Yeah, sure.

40:18.303 --> 40:21.063
I swear.
I'm fucking finished with him.

40:24.103 --> 40:25.623
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:25.903 --> 40:27.783
I can fix it.
I can fix it.

40:27.943 --> 40:29.383
Please stop.

40:29.583 --> 40:31.623
Just watch.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.503
You have to trust me.

40:39.623 --> 40:42.663
Fuck. Look.
I have to go.

40:44.463 --> 40:46.903
This is gonna be okay.
Trust me.

41:28.023 --> 41:29.383
Where the fuck
have you been?

41:29.463 --> 41:31.543
Taking care of that Nikki thing.
Like you asked me.

41:31.743 --> 41:33.623
And?

41:33.903 --> 41:37.423
Yeah. Grand.
It's all gonna get sorted.

41:39.703 --> 41:42.423
Eric, this is Derek, an old pal
of mine from way back.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.023
Alright, Eric?

41:44.263 --> 41:46.863
Now get yourself a drink
and join us.

41:47.023 --> 41:48.703
Yeah. No bother.

41:51.023 --> 41:52.503
John. A whiskey.

41:56.223 --> 41:57.503
Cheers.

42:08.703 --> 42:09.903
Alright. Bren's there.

42:15.343 --> 42:17.543
You know what I keep thinking?

42:17.703 --> 42:19.183
What?

42:22.503 --> 42:25.023
Why Mam didn't take us with her
when she was going.

42:28.023 --> 42:29.943
You ever wonder where they are?

42:33.223 --> 42:34.543
Not anymore.

42:35.863 --> 42:37.663
I do.

42:39.543 --> 42:41.263
All the fuckin' time.

42:46.023 --> 42:47.023
Text Viking.

42:47.223 --> 42:48.983
Tell him
that we're five minutes out.

43:15.103 --> 43:16.903
Ohh.

43:30.183 --> 43:32.223
You seen Bren?

43:32.383 --> 43:34.623
No.

43:34.823 --> 43:36.583
Fuck's sake.

44:00.663 --> 44:02.183
What the fuck?

44:05.463 --> 44:06.703
Bren?!

44:15.943 --> 44:17.423
Fuck.

44:25.943 --> 44:28.503
Anyone fuckin' seen Bren?

44:28.743 --> 44:30.703
Yeah, he's out the front there
with Derek.

44:32.623 --> 44:33.663
- Bren.
- Yeah.

44:33.863 --> 44:35.383
Someone outside
I want you to meet.

44:35.583 --> 44:36.863
Hey!
What have I told you

44:37.063 --> 44:39.183
about bringing that
dribbly bollocks in here?

44:39.423 --> 44:40.423
- Bren!
- Sorry, Bren.

44:40.663 --> 44:42.103
- Bren!
- What?!

44:42.383 --> 44:44.263
There's someone outside
I want you to meet. Who?

44:44.303 --> 44:45.623
It's a fella who says he knows

44:45.903 --> 44:47.383
where Jess Duggan's
been holed up.

44:47.583 --> 44:49.383
Well, bring him in.
I already asked him.

44:49.623 --> 44:52.383
He won't come in.
He says he's too nervous.

44:57.943 --> 45:00.903
Jesus, Da.
What happened to your face?

45:05.303 --> 45:08.383
Oh, you finally grew
a pair of fuckin' balls.

45:15.343 --> 45:17.343
What the fuck is going on?

45:19.023 --> 45:20.903
Pull over. Stop the car.

45:42.663 --> 45:45.503
What the fuck happened?

45:45.663 --> 45:46.983
I shot him.

46:34.183 --> 46:36.943
Is everything okay?

46:37.103 --> 46:38.903
There's something
I need to tell you.

47:28.063 --> 47:29.343
Can we get you anything, Da?
