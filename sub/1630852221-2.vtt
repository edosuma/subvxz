04:25.800 --> 04:32.560
GOMORRA

05:06.920 --> 05:07.879
Here's the check.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.639
I'l pay.

06:00.639 --> 06:02.040
Why didn't you come back?

06:03.800 --> 06:08.000
The person who sent me here said
it was the only way to save you,

06:08.079 --> 06:10.600
so you and your family
could live in peace.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.079
You saw what happened to the person
who sent you here.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.319
Let's go back to Naples now, Ciro.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.920
Me and you.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.759
We'll settle everything together.

06:34.079 --> 06:35.680
I'm not going back, Genna'.

06:36.639 --> 06:38.720
There's no going back.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.879
The world I knew doesn't exist anymore.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.240
Everything I loved is destroyed,

06:51.759 --> 06:54.920
what was worth living for is dead.

06:57.319 --> 06:59.199
Well, I still believe in it.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.959
I thought it was the same for you
but I was wrong.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.560
What happens now
that Don Aniello's dead?

07:15.680 --> 07:18.240
Tonight I'm meeting
the new Russian contact,

07:18.319 --> 07:20.839
I gotta explain to him
why the drugs aren't coming.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.759
- It's a problem for me.
- I'll come with you tonight.

07:24.839 --> 07:27.800
We'll introduce him to his new supplier.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.800
If you could do it all over,
what would you do?

07:44.639 --> 07:48.399
Everything I did,
even giving my life for you.

07:49.519 --> 07:51.959
But then you left me on my own.

07:53.399 --> 07:55.240
I did it to protect you.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.399
You don't know what it feels like
to think you killed a brother.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.440
- Dimitri!
- Ciro!

09:32.519 --> 09:35.000
This is Gennaro Savastano.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.759
I bet 5,000 euros on him.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.000
Really!

10:43.519 --> 10:45.879
Ilya Kurianov.
Ciro Di Marzio.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.440
I've heard great things
about you, Ciro Di Marzio.

11:02.519 --> 11:04.879
We were in the secret service together.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.080
The market's expanding.

11:11.399 --> 11:13.759
Word of your quality and prices

11:14.080 --> 11:16.080
has spread as far as St Petersburg.

11:16.159 --> 11:17.840
How much do you need?

11:18.320 --> 11:19.480
100.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.000
Is 100kg too much to start with?

11:28.360 --> 11:29.919
Not a problem.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.159
He's your broker from today.

11:33.720 --> 11:35.440
He's the best in the world.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.279
Ilya, it's a stroke of luck
to have you with us.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.960
Two strokes of luck.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.600
The pleasure of seeing a friend again

11:49.799 --> 11:52.039
and that of meeting
new business partners.

11:54.919 --> 11:57.639
Let's make a toast
with our best champagne.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.879
What did you say to him?

12:16.960 --> 12:20.120
That my friend is the best
in the world in his field.

12:22.919 --> 12:25.399
Friendship is the best thing that exists,

12:26.600 --> 12:29.679
having a friend is better
than having a woman.

12:29.759 --> 12:32.200
Love for a friend is absolute.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.120
But a friend's always
gotta be sincere, loyal.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.960
If a friend betrays you,
is he still a friend?

12:46.320 --> 12:48.279
I've never betrayed you.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.120
What a great night!

13:04.639 --> 13:06.200
We've made an excellent deal,

13:09.480 --> 13:11.440
with good friends.

15:55.759 --> 15:57.039
Move it.

15:59.679 --> 16:00.840
Faster!

16:18.039 --> 16:19.799
Gimme your belt.

16:21.159 --> 16:22.080
C'mon.

16:25.159 --> 16:26.679
Ring and necklace.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.600
The necklace.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.200
The shipment will be here
by the end of the month.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.480
This is the container number.

18:30.039 --> 18:32.920
It's okay for now.
But then what?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.799
I can send you shipment
every two months.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.880
Same amount, same quality.

18:40.759 --> 18:41.880
The best in the world.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.200
I guess we have a deal.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.200
I want to see him.

18:58.440 --> 18:59.440
Of course.

19:00.759 --> 19:02.200
Let's go.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.480
You know what this place is?

21:44.640 --> 21:46.880
They call it a gulag.

21:48.559 --> 21:51.599
It's like a prison, but not only.

21:54.519 --> 21:56.400
It's a place of atonement,

21:58.000 --> 21:59.640
of suffering.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.720
You only get out of here
after paying for all your sins.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.680
And that often happens after you die.

22:12.480 --> 22:14.799
Why are you doing this to me?

22:19.079 --> 22:20.680
Why?

22:22.200 --> 22:23.799
Are you serious?

22:28.079 --> 22:31.480
Because when I needed you,
you didn't give a shit.

22:35.039 --> 22:37.400
You abandoned me
and didn't give a fuck.

22:40.880 --> 22:44.079
You said it yourself, no?
Our world is dead.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.119
I'm dead.

22:51.160 --> 22:55.319
You wanted to go on by yourself
as always, ditching everyone.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.400
But this time I'm stopping you.

22:59.119 --> 23:02.240
You're making
the biggest mistake of your life.

23:02.319 --> 23:04.960
I contacted the Russian before I came.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.920
I reimbursed him for the shipment
you and your friend stole,

23:14.000 --> 23:15.839
that's how we became partners.

23:20.400 --> 23:24.440
But before getting to all this,
I had to look you in the eye,

23:24.519 --> 23:26.279
I had to understand.

23:42.079 --> 23:45.119
From now on they'll take care of you.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.880
You'll spend every day
of your life in here,

23:48.839 --> 23:52.680
without knowing if it's morning
or night, rainy or sunny.

23:55.480 --> 23:57.640
They'll give you food, water,

23:59.359 --> 24:00.880
if you're sick they'll look after you.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.279
You'll grow old thinking of the people

24:03.359 --> 24:05.680
who loved you but you killed them.

24:05.759 --> 24:07.599
Like Deborah.

24:09.079 --> 24:10.759
Like Maria Rita.

24:14.279 --> 24:16.119
And like me.

24:19.599 --> 24:22.359
I would have shared the world with you.

24:32.559 --> 24:35.880
You've never been able
to keep up with me.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.480
You're still that kid
that wakes up scared,

24:43.960 --> 24:45.759
that can't sleep at night

24:46.680 --> 24:48.960
and wakes up crying for help.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.880
You're still the wrong son
of that father.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.359
Don Pietro had more respect for me

24:58.440 --> 25:00.920
when I killed him
than he ever did for you.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.799
That's why you're locking me in here,
you know, right?

25:05.839 --> 25:09.079
As long as I'm around,
you'll always come second.

25:15.559 --> 25:18.240
Pray that I never get out of here.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.279
Not eating, you son of a bitch?

29:10.319 --> 29:11.240
Get up!

30:50.960 --> 30:53.880
Not even my dog would eat this shit.

31:39.640 --> 31:40.960
Igor, get in here!

31:44.599 --> 31:45.720
Untie him!

31:53.279 --> 31:54.519
Hurry up.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.200
If he dies we're fucked.

32:06.279 --> 32:09.359
- We gotta let Kurianov know.
- Go, I'll stay here with him.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.359
Viktor!

33:17.319 --> 33:20.240
- He escaped, we gotta find him!
- Hurry, fuck!

33:21.759 --> 33:23.599
Careful, he's armed.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.839
Quick!

34:19.599 --> 34:21.880
He went that way!

34:22.199 --> 34:24.880
He ran into the woods!

35:46.360 --> 35:48.480
He's heading for the river.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.159
Who are you? What do you want?

38:45.920 --> 38:47.360
Here.

39:02.480 --> 39:04.000
You like it?

39:05.320 --> 39:07.119
I made it.

39:07.519 --> 39:08.679
Thank you.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.639
It's very good.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.639
Have some bread too.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.360
You can rest before you leave.

39:36.199 --> 39:38.360
They're still looking for me,

39:38.440 --> 39:39.639
it's not safe.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.719
The woods aren't safe at night,
it's better if you stay.

40:38.199 --> 40:39.880
Good evening.

40:57.119 --> 40:59.000
We're looking for a man,

40:59.840 --> 41:01.159
an Italian.

41:02.159 --> 41:04.119
We haven't seen anyone.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.239
Look inside!

41:13.559 --> 41:16.760
One in there and the other over there.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.920
- I didn't say you could go in.
- I don't trust you.

41:20.719 --> 41:22.079
Latvian shitbag!

42:37.760 --> 42:39.280
Goodbye.

42:41.159 --> 42:42.559
Take care.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.320
Where will you go?

44:18.639 --> 44:20.320
To visit a friend.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.599
IN THE NEXT EPISODE
