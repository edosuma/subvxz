This programme contains adult humour

00:35.012 --> 00:37.444
Eh, The Avengers?

00:37.444 --> 00:39.106
Naw.

00:39.106 --> 00:42.243
People in plastic suits
flying aboot like diddies.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.524
Aye.

00:43.524 --> 00:45.316
Ironing Man.

00:45.316 --> 00:46.914
Iron Man!

00:46.914 --> 00:48.515
What did I say?Ironing Man.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.012
Huh! He'd be a rubbish superhero,
Jack, eh?

00:51.012 --> 00:54.722
Standing there watching EastEnders
rattling through a washing,

00:54.722 --> 00:57.475
"I'll have this done in no time,
for I am Ironing Man!"

00:57.475 --> 00:59.012
CHUCKLES

00:59.012 --> 01:00.048
Right enough.

01:00.048 --> 01:02.786
OK, Wendy's Wild Flower?

01:02.786 --> 01:04.387
Oh, what's that aboot?

01:04.388 --> 01:07.459
It's a young couple of lovers
at it like knives,

01:07.459 --> 01:09.058
sweat bailing aff them,

01:09.060 --> 01:11.108
no even stoppin' for a plate o' soup
or nothing.

01:11.108 --> 01:15.908
Daein' it in phone boxes, in cars,
up closes, aw that. It's an 18.

01:15.908 --> 01:18.019
Och, naw, the place'll be full
of women.

01:18.019 --> 01:21.090
Aye, we'll be sitting up the back
like perverts

01:21.090 --> 01:23.587
with a couple of storkies.

01:23.587 --> 01:26.594
Awright, this one is about zombies.

01:26.596 --> 01:28.834
Undead Rising.
What happens in that?

01:28.834 --> 01:30.628
The undead rise.

01:30.628 --> 01:33.060
Start eatin' people's brains
cos they're brain daft.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.683
Ach, I cannae be bothered
with aw that, Jack.

01:35.683 --> 01:38.563
Do ye want to just go doon the
Clansman and get a couple of pints?

01:38.563 --> 01:40.611
Nah, I think we should go and see a
movie.

01:40.611 --> 01:42.722
I think it would keep oor
mind aff things,

01:42.724 --> 01:44.644
otherwise we're just going into
the Clansman

01:44.644 --> 01:46.884
and lookin' at two empty seats
where Tam and Eric used tae sit.

01:46.884 --> 01:50.980
And Winston's to lose his other leg
soon.

01:50.980 --> 01:52.772
The old band ain't what it used
to be.

01:52.772 --> 01:56.611
Aye. Like The Drifters -
doon tae its original member

01:56.611 --> 02:00.387
and a bunch o' deadbeat hangers-on
just tryin' to keep the numbers up.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.730
He should be called "The Drifter".

02:01.730 --> 02:03.203
CHUCKLES

02:03.203 --> 02:07.171
Listen, Jack, I've been thinking a
wee bit lately aboot my ain funeral.

02:07.171 --> 02:08.705
Aye, that'll cheer us up.
Let's talk aboot that.

02:08.705 --> 02:10.241
Shut up. Hear me out.

02:10.241 --> 02:12.098
SIGHS
I'm no wanting one.

02:12.098 --> 02:15.299
Ye've got to have a funeral!
Otherwise naebody knows you're deid.

02:15.300 --> 02:18.306
Listen. It's my funeral,
and I'm no wanting one.

02:18.306 --> 02:20.227
Like that David Bowie fella,

02:20.228 --> 02:23.235
he never had one.
Didnae want tae put his pals
through all that misery,

02:23.235 --> 02:26.050
you know? He just...skipped it.

02:26.050 --> 02:29.251
What's miserable aboot it?
You get planted, we get pished.

02:29.252 --> 02:30.723
That's a good day oot.

02:30.723 --> 02:33.603
It's no often you get a good day oot
at oor age.

02:33.604 --> 02:35.780
Aye. And how's that a good day out
for me, Jack, eh,

02:35.780 --> 02:38.467
lying in my box looking up
at you lot getting pished?

02:38.467 --> 02:41.667
No havin' a funeral
fur Davie Bowie's OK,
because he was a pop legend.

02:41.668 --> 02:42.948
A man of mystery.

02:42.948 --> 02:44.419
Baith his eyes were
different colours.

02:44.419 --> 02:46.467
It looked as if he wis fae
another planet.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.730
So, when he dies, well,
it seems as if he went back there.

02:49.730 --> 02:52.931
But you, well,
you're a nae-mark pensioner.

02:52.931 --> 02:54.914
And anyway,
baith your eyes are the same colour.

02:54.914 --> 02:57.538
Oh, but here, if ye want to go
like David Bowie,

02:57.538 --> 02:59.524
what I'll dae is I'll get a blue
Smartie

02:59.524 --> 03:01.508
and I'll stick it the eye
of your dead corpse.

03:01.508 --> 03:07.972
Then I'll sing Ashes To Ashes.

03:07.972 --> 03:10.914
Of course, I'll no be singing
at your funeral, Jack.

03:10.914 --> 03:12.650
I'll be dancin'...on yer grave.

03:12.650 --> 03:20.962
CHUCKLING

03:20.962 --> 03:29.218
What will I say?

03:29.218 --> 03:35.364
You'll say nothing,
ye silly old bastard.

03:35.364 --> 03:36.900
Can I help you, Winston?

03:36.900 --> 03:38.449
Naw.

03:38.449 --> 03:40.292
Aye.

03:40.292 --> 03:42.532
Naw. Mebbe. Mebbe. Och, naw.

03:42.532 --> 03:45.218
Have I to pick one?

03:45.218 --> 03:48.804
I was wondering if you could explain
something to me.

03:48.804 --> 03:49.890
At Tam's do,

03:49.890 --> 03:53.474
I got a really strange phone call...

03:53.474 --> 03:56.036
..fae Tam's phone.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.020
You think he's phoning you
fae beyond the grave?

03:58.020 --> 04:00.132
I just...

04:00.132 --> 04:01.924
Look, I'm sorry.
I shouldnae have come.

04:01.924 --> 04:04.370
It was me.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.634
I keep his phone in ma bag.

04:05.634 --> 04:07.043
I like to have it close.

04:07.044 --> 04:10.627
Sometimes when I've reached in,
I've dialled somebody by mistake.

04:10.627 --> 04:12.227
I should put the phone in a drawer.

04:12.228 --> 04:13.828
Och, I'm awful sorry, hen.

04:13.828 --> 04:15.747
I...I didnae mean to upset you.

04:15.747 --> 04:33.348
No, it's awright. It's awright,
Winston. Thanks for stopping by.

04:33.348 --> 04:34.627
JACK: Zombies.

04:34.627 --> 04:36.355
SCOFFS
A lot o' garbage.

04:36.355 --> 04:37.507
Aye.

04:37.507 --> 04:40.514
Probably been better aff goin' tae
see that sci-fi movie,
Hidden Spaceship.

04:40.516 --> 04:42.180
What do you imagine that was aw
aboot?

04:42.180 --> 04:44.355
Oh, I don't know, Jack,
I'm no film critic,

04:44.355 --> 04:46.723
but might it be about a spaceship

04:46.723 --> 04:47.747
that was hidden?

04:47.747 --> 04:49.348
CHUCKLES

04:49.348 --> 04:51.908
See if a zombie came at me,
I dunno, in the Clansman, like...

04:51.908 --> 04:53.956
Oh, right, what would you dae there?

04:53.956 --> 04:56.579
Well, your zombie's main objective
is tae wire intae the brain.

04:56.579 --> 04:57.795
CHOMPING

04:57.795 --> 04:59.074
I'd just act doolally.

04:59.076 --> 05:03.684
"Is that you, Brian?
Oh, I've no seen ye in ages, son!"

05:03.684 --> 05:05.540
The zombie'd be like that,
"Ach, that's a shame.

05:05.540 --> 05:08.548
"That poor auld bastard's
brain's turned tae mush.
I'm no eatin' that!"

05:08.548 --> 05:11.235
Aye, cos your zombies are like that,
aren't they?

05:11.235 --> 05:14.050
They kick the door o' the pub in,
wander up tae the pensioner,

05:14.052 --> 05:17.449
and they're like that, "Oh, haud on.
I'm gonnae have tae assess

05:17.449 --> 05:20.579
"this poor pensioner's mental state
of health." That's right.

05:20.579 --> 05:21.923
"Before I chow down on his brain,

05:21.923 --> 05:23.651
"I'm going to have to
take the blood pressure,

05:23.651 --> 05:25.764
"get my wee doctor's torch out,
shine it in the eyes,

05:25.764 --> 05:27.172
"and a urine sample."

05:27.172 --> 05:30.754
Of course, you widnae need that
because you've pished yerself
already.

05:30.754 --> 05:33.250
He'd be better aff wi' Boabby's
brains. Much younger.

05:33.252 --> 05:35.172
LAUGHING

05:35.172 --> 05:37.411

05:37.411 --> 05:42.084
That's a light snack.
Aye, a starter...

05:42.084 --> 05:44.708
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

05:44.708 --> 05:47.524
Eh, well, a zomb...

05:47.524 --> 05:53.987

06:12.995 --> 06:15.235
You should gie it a go.

Especially that small chunk pickle.

08:48.836 --> 08:50.628

10:36.226 --> 10:40.259
He's no even cauld yet
and you're pishing yersel'.

10:40.259 --> 10:42.692
How long did you gie it
after your Harry died

10:42.692 --> 10:44.355
before you had a good laugh, Isa?

10:44.355 --> 10:46.274
Aye, well, it was actually...

10:46.274 --> 10:49.475
..as the box was burnin',
but...but that was nerves.

10:49.475 --> 10:54.082
In terms of actual laughing,
bus-stop laughing,

10:54.082 --> 10:55.682
well,

10:55.682 --> 10:59.010
four to six weeks
would be an accepted waiting time.

10:59.010 --> 11:01.250
Well, here's what I'll dae, Isa.

11:01.250 --> 11:04.706
I'll just head back up the road,
get back intae ma black dress

11:04.706 --> 11:07.524
and sit there weeping
till you chap ma door

11:07.524 --> 11:13.730
and gie me the all clear to snigger,
at least.

11:13.730 --> 11:15.650
RADIO: Sweeties and biscuits
aren't the same

11:15.652 --> 11:16.932
as what they used to be, are they?

11:16.932 --> 11:19.364
Whatever happened to Sherbet Dabs?

11:19.364 --> 11:20.706
We've got them in the shop.

11:20.706 --> 11:22.692
And Opal Fruits?

11:22.692 --> 11:25.508
They're called Starburst now.
Get over it. Arsehole.

11:25.508 --> 11:28.644
And when I was a kid,
Wagon Wheels were HUUUUUGE!

11:28.644 --> 11:30.884
Aye, that's cos yer hands were tiny!

11:30.884 --> 11:34.730
It's an optical illusion called
growing, you brainless bastard!

11:34.730 --> 11:38.307
Och, now look what you made me do,
ya wanker!

11:38.307 --> 11:41.330
TYRES SCREECH

11:41.330 --> 11:50.082
Tam?!

11:50.082 --> 11:58.211
Haw!

11:58.211 --> 12:01.923
FRUSTRATED YELL

12:01.923 --> 12:05.058
Look at this mad rocket, man,
he's the Terminator!

12:05.058 --> 12:07.235
What ye expecting us tae dae?

12:07.235 --> 12:10.250
An abandoned van
crammed full of sweeties!

12:10.250 --> 12:11.844
Look what's happened noo!

12:11.844 --> 12:21.250
We've tanned
yer crammed abandoned van, man!

12:21.250 --> 12:26.883
Navid?

12:26.884 --> 12:30.082
Gie's a double brandy, Boabby.
You don't drink.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.369
Single, then.

12:31.370 --> 12:32.706
That's still drinking.

12:32.706 --> 12:34.115
Campari and soda then.

12:34.115 --> 12:35.268
Still alcohol.

12:35.268 --> 12:36.676
Low-alcohol lager?

12:36.676 --> 12:39.043
Still booze.
Low booze, but still booze.

12:39.043 --> 12:56.962
Well, gie's a pack of they
Scampi Fries, then.

12:56.964 --> 12:59.524
Have those Scampi Fries
settled yer nerves, Navid?

12:59.524 --> 13:00.676
Naw.

13:00.676 --> 13:03.490
Hit me with more Scampi Fries,
barman.

13:03.490 --> 13:06.889
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I think you've had enough.

13:06.889 --> 13:10.596
Why are you all janglin'?

13:10.596 --> 13:17.572
I just saw Tam.

13:17.572 --> 13:20.330
Navid, you've imagined it.

13:20.330 --> 13:24.292
No. I'm no an alkie pensioner
like you lot.

13:24.292 --> 13:25.379
I know what I saw.

13:25.379 --> 13:28.196
This would explain Frances's
laughing.

13:28.196 --> 13:30.500
You seen him, Jack.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.292
Something's no right.

13:32.292 --> 13:33.316
Now wait a minute.

13:33.316 --> 13:36.388
You and him think ye seen him.

13:36.388 --> 13:39.010
Two maybe sightings.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.826
Aye, if we'd a third sighting
that we could rely on.

13:41.826 --> 13:44.514
Well, as a matter of fact, I seen
him.

13:44.514 --> 13:49.826
Well, as I say, if there was
a third sighting we could rely on...

13:49.826 --> 13:52.451
What do you think, Boabby?
What do I think?

13:52.451 --> 13:55.460
I think yous are all
aff your rockers.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.058
Wait till I tell Winston
all this pish.

13:57.058 --> 13:58.914
Naw, naw, naw, naw,
ye cannae dae that.

13:58.916 --> 14:02.052
Winston and Tam were big pals
for a lot of years.

14:02.052 --> 14:03.394
Aye, it's tactless, that.

14:03.394 --> 14:06.019
You don't want to go upsettin' him.
He's got a lot on his plate.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.644
Aye, listen to the boys, Boabby.

14:08.644 --> 14:10.947
You'll just need tae keep your trap
shut.

14:10.947 --> 14:15.812
LAUGHTER

14:15.812 --> 14:17.604
Very funny.

14:17.604 --> 14:20.690
Navid, did you see his face?

14:20.690 --> 14:23.940
As plain as I'm looking at yours.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.091
So what did ye dae?

14:25.091 --> 14:26.562
I chased him.

14:26.562 --> 14:29.506
But I had to break off the chase
because two wide-os stole my van.

14:29.508 --> 14:33.860
The van was full of cash-and-carry,
so that chase took precedent.

14:33.860 --> 14:36.100
I chased them for four streets,
and they stalled it.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.556
And then I battered the shite
out of the pair of them.

14:39.556 --> 14:42.562
I went in a wee bit too hard,
though, so I gave them a Curly Wurly
each

14:42.562 --> 14:44.482
to buy their silence
and avoid court.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.274
I'll tell you this, though,

14:46.274 --> 14:48.067
they'll be sucking
they Curly Wurlys noo,

14:48.067 --> 14:53.379
cos they've nae teeth left.

14:53.379 --> 14:56.004
Hello, Mr Ingram. What you after?

14:56.004 --> 14:59.010
Can I wait? I'm waiting on a...

14:59.010 --> 15:00.291
..um, on a...

15:00.292 --> 15:02.658
Are you on a date?Maybe.

15:02.658 --> 15:03.746
What's her name?

15:03.748 --> 15:05.346
Never you mind, baby Isa.

15:05.346 --> 15:07.331
A date in here?

15:07.331 --> 15:10.850
What's wrang wi' this place?
Well, it's a bit shite, innit?

15:10.850 --> 15:13.410
I'd go aff ma nut if ma Fergie
brought me in here.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.460
Well, is there anything you can dae

15:15.460 --> 15:18.850
to make this place
more of a romantic setting?

15:18.850 --> 15:24.100
Aye.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.532
Is that it, then?Aye.

15:26.532 --> 15:33.956
That's you ready for yer roll
and yer hole.

15:33.956 --> 15:36.004
Noreen.

15:36.004 --> 15:39.202
Winston.

15:39.202 --> 15:40.674
Lovely to meet you.

15:40.676 --> 15:44.836
It's lovely to meet you too.

15:44.836 --> 15:45.988
Can I get you a beverage?

15:45.988 --> 15:47.716
What do you have?

15:47.716 --> 15:49.892
Coffee, tea or Bovril.

15:49.892 --> 15:52.580
I'll try a Bovril.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.370
What aboot you, shagger?

15:54.370 --> 15:57.315
Bovril!

15:57.316 --> 15:58.980
You look great.

15:58.980 --> 16:00.649
Just what I expected.

16:00.649 --> 16:02.434
You look even better in person.

16:02.436 --> 16:04.548
Thank you.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.211
So often you go out on these things

16:06.211 --> 16:08.130
and people have bummed themselves
up.

16:08.130 --> 16:12.291
Ha! Aye. Wi' me,
what you see is what you get.

16:12.292 --> 16:15.940
It's better to be honest, isn't it?

16:15.940 --> 16:17.604
Eh... On that,

16:17.604 --> 16:20.932
I...I...I think it's important
to tell you that,

16:20.932 --> 16:22.082
in the next couple of weeks,

16:22.082 --> 16:24.067
I'm going to have my remaining leg
took aff.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.754
Oh, that's terrible.

16:26.754 --> 16:28.610
I'm so sorry to hear that.

16:28.610 --> 16:30.914
Well, that's good of you.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.899
I just wanted to be straight.

16:32.899 --> 16:35.586
And I appreciate that.

16:35.586 --> 16:37.572
I'm just going to powder my nose.

16:37.572 --> 16:41.154
Of course.

16:41.154 --> 16:43.010
You ready to order?

16:43.010 --> 16:45.634
Aye. Just a wee minute, hen.
She's just away to powder her nose.

16:45.634 --> 16:52.610
Where's the powder room,
in that taxi?Eh?

16:52.610 --> 17:02.980
Dirty, shallow bastard.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.858
ISA:I feel bad aboot this.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.419
You're feeling bad aboot
creeping aboot looking for info,

17:08.420 --> 17:10.722
trying to get to the bottom
of a mystery?

17:10.722 --> 17:12.528
No, fair play.

17:12.528 --> 17:15.714
I'm lovin' ma life.

17:15.714 --> 17:17.507
What is it we're looking for?

17:17.508 --> 17:19.810
Anything. Clues. A document.

17:19.810 --> 17:27.747
Evidence.

17:27.748 --> 17:28.770
Where is everybody?

17:28.770 --> 17:31.076
I dunno.

17:31.076 --> 17:32.290
Bowls.

17:32.290 --> 17:36.644
Bingo.

17:36.644 --> 17:38.500
It's this creepy bastard.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.328
He empties the place.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.106
Another Dark Heart, please,

17:43.106 --> 17:45.220
and whatever Mr Ingram's having.

17:45.220 --> 17:49.250
Oh, large goldie, please.

17:49.250 --> 17:53.604
LOUDLY:Doesnae seem like
a creepy bastard to me, Boabby.

17:53.604 --> 17:55.010
Yer health, Mr Sheathing.

17:55.010 --> 17:56.355
And yours, Mr Ingram.

17:56.355 --> 17:58.914
So, how was your date?

17:58.914 --> 18:00.451
Good. Aye.

18:00.451 --> 18:03.714
We laughed, we chatted,

18:03.714 --> 18:05.891
and then 45 seconds later, she left.

18:05.892 --> 18:07.940
SNORTS

18:07.940 --> 18:09.220
What went wrang?

18:09.220 --> 18:12.674
I told her about ma leg
and she rubbed salt into the wound

18:12.674 --> 18:15.234
by using her legs
to run outside and intae a taxi.

18:15.236 --> 18:17.284
CHUCKLING

18:17.284 --> 18:20.548
See? Truth gets ye naewhere.

18:20.548 --> 18:22.852
And you were laughing at me!

18:22.852 --> 18:23.940
SCOFFS

18:23.940 --> 18:25.858
Everybody laughs at you, Boabby.

18:25.858 --> 18:29.634
See if you'd've swept some details
under the carpet,

18:29.634 --> 18:33.154
you might have been on the bones
right now.

18:33.154 --> 18:38.596
Look, you stick to your game plan
and I'll stick to mine.

18:38.596 --> 18:41.930
DOOR OPENS

18:41.930 --> 18:43.394
Suzanne?

18:43.394 --> 18:44.932
No!

18:44.932 --> 18:49.412
LAUGHS

18:49.412 --> 18:51.971
Right, c'mon, boys.

18:51.971 --> 18:53.250
This is a wash-oot.

18:53.250 --> 18:56.962
Haud on.

18:56.962 --> 18:59.088
ANSWERPHONE:Tuesday. 5pm.

I mean, I want a discount.

19:07.848 --> 19:09.634
What with me no bein'...

19:09.634 --> 19:14.692

CLICK, BEEP

19:14.692 --> 19:17.250
FILM:I've got to tell you,
Mrs Johnson, it's not good.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.618
Your husband's going to spend
the rest of his life in a
wheelchair.

19:19.618 --> 19:23.971
We're removing both those legs
tonight.

19:23.971 --> 19:26.530
Listen. There's something
I havnae telt you.

19:26.530 --> 19:27.810
What is it?

19:27.810 --> 19:29.603
You know how I told you I've only
one leg?

19:29.604 --> 19:32.482
Uh-huh.
And I told you it doesnae bother me.

19:32.482 --> 19:36.451
Aye, and I appreciate that.

19:36.451 --> 19:38.564
But the other one's to come aff
shortly.

19:38.564 --> 19:41.762
Oh, my God!

19:41.762 --> 19:46.371
That's terrible.

19:46.372 --> 19:50.338
Would you like me to get you
some popcorn?

19:50.338 --> 19:56.355
SIGHS
Aye.

19:56.355 --> 20:04.548
Don't forget your coat.

20:04.548 --> 20:06.722
CLAMOURING

20:06.722 --> 20:09.666
Four pints, Boabby.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.075
This is ridiculous.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.250
It's the last time I listen
to yous two.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.556
The bar's never been busier
and I'm losing money?!

20:15.556 --> 20:22.788
"Trust us, Boabby! If Tam's alive,
he'll no be able to resist this! "

20:22.788 --> 20:25.538
Gie it another five minutes,
Boabby, eh?Aye, c'mon, Boabby.

20:25.538 --> 20:27.138
We've got to know for sure!

20:27.140 --> 20:34.692
Boabby! I'm trying tae
get a game of pool here!

20:34.692 --> 20:36.482
Right!

20:36.482 --> 20:41.090
Every bastard oot.

20:41.092 --> 20:45.700
Get oot!

20:45.700 --> 20:49.220
Gie's a carry-oot, Boabby.
There's Â£1 -

20:49.220 --> 20:52.740
that equals ten cans.

20:52.740 --> 20:54.084
Party's over.

20:54.084 --> 21:02.211
Sling yer hook!

21:02.211 --> 21:05.604
SIGHS
Well, pardon the pun,

21:05.604 --> 21:07.778
but that is the final nail
in the coffin.

21:07.778 --> 21:08.808
Aye.

21:08.808 --> 21:10.530
He's away.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.028
Well, you were right about
something, Isa.

21:13.028 --> 21:14.626
Grief does strange things.

21:14.626 --> 21:17.634
Aye, it does that, boys.

21:17.634 --> 21:21.604
Cannae take nae pleasure
in being right aboot that.

21:21.604 --> 21:23.010
BOABBY:Jack, Victor, Isa,

21:23.010 --> 21:34.019
you might want tae come and huv

21:34.019 --> 21:44.002
Look.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.884
Oh-ho-ho!

21:46.884 --> 21:48.170
VICTOR:Jesus Christ!

21:48.170 --> 22:00.002
Welcome back, Tam.

22:00.002 --> 22:02.500
This is it, son.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.188
Your last throw of the dice.

22:05.188 --> 22:07.875
Strike out here
and...you're retired.

22:07.875 --> 22:10.434
CLEARS THROAT

22:10.434 --> 22:12.994
Green coat? You must be Winnie.

22:12.996 --> 22:15.556
And you must be Winston.

22:15.556 --> 22:17.284
It's nice to meet you.

22:17.284 --> 22:20.996
So, gonnae sit yerself doon?

22:20.996 --> 22:23.940
Aye, I will in a minute. Eh...

22:23.940 --> 22:27.586
Listen, I've no been having
a great deal of success

22:27.586 --> 22:31.426
wi' this dating malarkey,
and...and I'll tell you for why.

22:31.428 --> 22:35.522
The day after tomorrow,
I...I'm going into the hospital

22:35.522 --> 22:38.787
for an operation that's gonnae
put me in a wheelchair.

22:38.788 --> 22:42.756
So if ye want to walk away,
I'll no hold it against you.

22:42.756 --> 22:46.980
CHUCKLING:Well, that might be
a wee bit difficult.

22:46.980 --> 22:48.650
How's that?

22:48.650 --> 22:55.810
Because that chair
there belongs to me.

22:55.810 --> 22:58.692
THEY LAUGH

22:58.692 --> 23:00.420
Look...

23:00.420 --> 23:03.106
I know what you're gonnae say.

23:03.106 --> 23:06.115
"How would that work?
Two pensioners in chairs?"

23:06.115 --> 23:08.996
Well...aye.

23:08.996 --> 23:14.884
Well, I'll no hold it against you
if you leave.

23:14.884 --> 23:20.962
Thanks, Winnie.

23:20.962 --> 23:23.010
It was lovely meeting you.

23:23.010 --> 23:24.932
Good luck wi' it.

23:24.932 --> 23:28.002
And do you have a good wee network
of friends round about you?

23:28.002 --> 23:29.474
Oh, aye, aye.

23:29.476 --> 23:49.250
They're always there to dig you out.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.682
Mrs Drennan,
what is it that we're doing here?

23:51.682 --> 23:53.220
I was watching A Place In The Sun.

23:53.220 --> 23:59.618
You'll see in a minute,
ya wee black-hearted twister, ye!

23:59.618 --> 24:01.489
Mrs Drennan,
you're actually frightening me now.

24:01.490 --> 24:02.692
Oh!
CHUCKLES

24:02.692 --> 24:04.290
That's funny, in't it?

24:04.290 --> 24:07.298
Me and the undertaker
walking through the graveyard,

24:07.298 --> 24:10.050
and it's you that's
shiteing yourself!

24:10.050 --> 24:16.848
Just a little further.

24:16.848 --> 24:19.267
OWL HOOTS

24:19.268 --> 24:21.892
Evening, Mr Sheathing.

24:21.892 --> 24:24.644
What's the meaning of this?

24:24.644 --> 24:27.586
Oh, look at that, Victor.
Making oot as if he doesnae know
what's happening!

24:27.586 --> 24:28.866
About what?

24:28.866 --> 24:33.730
We are of the belief that were
we to dig this grave six feet,

24:33.730 --> 24:37.378
we'd find nothing but an empty box.

24:37.380 --> 24:40.962
If you were to dig this grave,
you would find not only your friend,

24:40.962 --> 24:43.460
but yourselves in police custody -

24:43.460 --> 24:44.996
for desecration.

24:44.996 --> 24:49.092
Good words, ya lanky, Sinestro,
Pale Rider bastard.

24:49.092 --> 24:53.250
This crime we're committing pales
into insignificance against yours.

24:53.250 --> 24:55.810
You faked the death o' oor pal.

24:55.810 --> 24:57.666
That's worse than discretion.

24:57.666 --> 24:59.651
Desecration, Jack.
What did I say?

24:59.652 --> 25:02.788
Discretion.
By all means, gentlemen,

25:02.788 --> 25:05.730
satisfy your curiosity.

25:05.730 --> 25:11.690
But make no mistake -
you'll be digging your own graves.

25:11.690 --> 25:16.368
Shut up.

25:16.368 --> 25:18.530
Ready, Jack?Oh, aye.

25:18.530 --> 25:21.090
Ready, Victor.

25:21.092 --> 25:23.332
Stop!

25:23.332 --> 25:25.316
You win.

25:25.316 --> 25:45.796
Where's Tam?

25:45.796 --> 25:47.210
I've died, right?

25:47.210 --> 25:49.124
You're still with us.

25:49.124 --> 25:52.067
As am I.

25:52.067 --> 25:53.474
Hello, Winston.

25:53.476 --> 25:56.036
Frances, hen,
are you seeing what I'm seeing?

25:56.036 --> 25:58.608
I am.

25:58.608 --> 26:01.795
But I want you to know,
this wasnae my idea.

26:01.796 --> 26:03.332
Naw.

26:03.332 --> 26:04.932
Naw, it was my idea.

26:04.932 --> 26:07.368
To do what?

26:07.368 --> 26:08.515
Hello, Tam.

26:08.516 --> 26:10.050
To fake his ain death.

26:10.050 --> 26:11.971
Why would ye dae that?

26:11.971 --> 26:14.084
Well, I...did it for you.

26:14.084 --> 26:17.154
I looked oot my insurance policy.

26:17.154 --> 26:19.076
23 grand.

26:19.076 --> 26:21.570
Gonnae be enough
to send you to Switzerland.

26:21.570 --> 26:24.194
I'm no goin' to Switzerland!

26:24.194 --> 26:27.010
I know what they dae tae pensioners
in they Swiss hotels.

26:27.010 --> 26:29.442
Boiled egg for breakfast
and a bullet for lunch.

26:29.442 --> 26:31.810
It's only my leg, for Christ's sake!

26:31.810 --> 26:34.883
Which you'll be keeping.
Thanks to that money.

26:34.884 --> 26:42.756
Frances?

26:42.756 --> 26:46.914
Naw. You put us all
through the mill.

26:46.914 --> 26:50.115
Well, I didnae really have
any other option, did I?

26:50.115 --> 26:52.740
Just take the bloody money, Winston.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.596
I'm deid noo, anyhow.

26:54.596 --> 26:56.324
Oh, aye. And how ye gonnae fix that?

26:56.324 --> 26:58.307
I suppose for a period of time

26:58.307 --> 27:00.355
you'll need to call me...Gerald,

27:00.355 --> 27:01.826
or something. No, no.

27:01.826 --> 27:04.067
Do you know what I've always
fancied?

27:04.067 --> 27:05.412
Clint.

27:05.412 --> 27:08.163
Or Dick, maybe?

27:08.163 --> 27:12.324
Well, here's the bad news,
Clint, Gerald, Dick.

27:12.324 --> 27:14.372
I'm no daein' it.

27:14.372 --> 27:15.652
I'm a Labour man.

27:15.652 --> 27:18.530
I worked all ma days on the Clyde.

27:18.530 --> 27:21.603
If the leg's coming aff, it's coming
aff. I'm no queue-jumping.

27:21.604 --> 27:23.202
You're no jumping any queues.

27:23.202 --> 27:24.482
You're next in the queue.

27:24.482 --> 27:27.364
You're goin' doon to that theatre
the morrow to get that whipped off.

27:27.364 --> 27:29.730
That cheque there
is your passport to savin' that leg.

27:29.730 --> 27:30.946
Jack's right.

27:30.948 --> 27:32.228
I mean, this silly bastard's

27:32.228 --> 27:35.568
gone to ridiculous lengths
to obtain that money.

27:35.568 --> 27:37.090
Take it.

27:37.092 --> 27:45.284
Get yourself to Switzerland,
and get that leg kept.

27:45.284 --> 27:46.564
Jack.

27:46.564 --> 27:47.714
Aye.

27:47.714 --> 27:49.378
See that sign up there?

27:49.380 --> 27:50.722
Uh-huh.

27:50.722 --> 28:26.563
Want tae rip it doon
and get me a fish supper?

28:26.564 --> 28:27.906
CHUCKLING

28:27.906 --> 28:31.171
Green coat? You must be Winnie.

28:31.172 --> 28:32.962
I am indeed.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.010
And you must be Winston.

28:35.010 --> 28:39.298
Winston and Winnie.
It's good that, in't it?

28:39.298 --> 28:42.115
I got you a gift...Oh!

28:42.115 --> 28:43.778
..fae Switzerland.

28:43.778 --> 28:46.914
GASPS
What is it?

28:46.914 --> 28:50.692
What else could it be?

28:50.692 --> 28:51.652
Oh!
