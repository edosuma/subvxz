WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.629
Try not to be
scared when you see him, okay?

00:04.755 --> 00:07.799
Mom, I've seen him sick.
I'm not scared.

00:07.925 --> 00:08.925
This time's different.

00:09.051 --> 00:11.302
The doctors gave him an extra course
of radiation and chemo...

00:11.428 --> 00:12.845
I know.

00:13.097 --> 00:16.557
And you understand how proud
we are of you, right?

00:17.893 --> 00:19.310
Gloves, mask.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.978
Matty, you said you wanted to see your
brother before the procedure.

01:03.564 --> 01:07.859
I know I look like an alien,
but I promise not to eat your brain.

01:10.738 --> 01:14.365
When this is done, will you be able
to play out back with me?

01:14.950 --> 01:17.326
I'll rip anything you
put near the strike zone.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.997
Let your brother rest up,
while we take some of your marrow.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.549
You don't need to be
in an isolation room,

01:31.675 --> 01:34.761
but I pulled some strings so you could
be next door to your brother.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.387
How many games will I miss?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.055
Well, you only have
to be here overnight,

01:38.182 --> 01:39.807
but you do have to
take it easy for a little bit.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.058
- I already missed two.
- Matty...

01:41.185 --> 01:42.810
I know. It's okay.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.812
It must have been a drag.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.856
We just had to make sure
you weren't exposed to any bugs,

01:46.982 --> 01:49.442
because your healthy bone marrow
is what's gonna cure

01:49.568 --> 01:51.110
your brother's leukemia.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.924
Go on.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.004
He sneezed.
Maybe it's just an allergy.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.339
Not with an enlarged spleen
and a fever.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.175
He's got one of 10,000
possible infections,

03:38.302 --> 03:41.721
even if it's just the common cold, I do
the transplant, he kills his brother.

03:41.847 --> 03:42.847
How long do we have?

03:42.973 --> 03:44.891
Radiation obliterated
his immune system.

03:45.017 --> 03:49.395
Even in a clean room,
he's got four, maybe five, days left.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.398
No way we can solve this that fast.
You need to find another donor.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.608
They're African American.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.902
It makes it nearly impossible
to find a full match.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.905
Tell me about it. I can't even find
the one I've got working for me.

03:59.448 --> 04:00.990
Where is Foreman?

04:08.957 --> 04:12.793
Nothing like a dead patient to send you
back to your choir boy roots.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.797
Hey, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.133
Wilson just killed a kid
same way you did.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.426
He's not dead.

04:20.552 --> 04:24.764
Five days are gonna fly by. He didn't
look both ways before he nuked.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.516
You done talking to
your imaginary friend?

04:27.643 --> 04:29.602
Because I thought, maybe,
you could do your job and just...

04:29.728 --> 04:32.688
Start the donor brother
on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.691
Great idea, if you're looking
to save exactly one kid.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.153
Broad-spec will take at least a week
to work. We need narrow-spec.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.529
How old is Hector?

04:40.656 --> 04:42.239
Our patient's name is Matty.
His brother's Nick.

04:42.366 --> 04:44.951
Hector's my dog.
He's about 17?

04:45.077 --> 04:49.997
Seventeen? That's, like, a 119 in human
years. Why is he still alive?

04:50.123 --> 04:53.417
Five days minus 20 seconds
talking about Wilson's dog.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.545
We need to start testing. Stool samples
for parasites, antibody tests...

04:56.672 --> 04:58.631
Blood panel was negative
for all the usual suspects.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.800
That's because the
infection is too small.

05:00.926 --> 05:03.761
We start testing now, it's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.639
We draw blood, odds are we're just
gonna come up with hay.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.808
We need to
grow more needles.

05:12.270 --> 05:15.439
Okay, that probably needs
further explanation.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.191
We make the donor kid sicker.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.819
We freeze him, we soak him,
break down his immune system.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.988
Suddenly we're looking at some needle
that a camel

05:22.114 --> 05:23.114
can pass through the eye of.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.158
Making him sicker risks spreading the
infection all throughout his body.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.952
True, but who cares?

05:28.078 --> 05:30.621
Once we know what the infection is,
we'll know exactly how to treat it.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.331
As long as he isn't dead yet,
we're cool.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.749
We should do
what we normally do.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.002
Go to the kid's house,
check for sources of the infection.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.712
Waste of time.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.256
You think it's in the house.
I know it's in the patient.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.717
Safer than intentionally
making the kid sicker.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.511
Fine, go.

05:52.394 --> 05:56.313
So exactly how sick
are you gonna make Matty?

05:56.523 --> 05:57.940
He could get quite ill.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.192
It certainly won't be a pleasant
experience for anyone,

06:00.318 --> 06:01.152
but it's our only...

06:01.278 --> 06:03.904
Ever get caught in the rain
without an umbrella?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.115
That's all we're
talking about here. Sign the form.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.827
It's a little more complicated than
that. We'll also be doing leukapheresis.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.412
We run Matty's blood
through a machine

06:11.538 --> 06:12.788
that filters out
his white blood cells.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.583
But without his white cells,
how could he get better in time?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.627
We'll pump the white blood cells back
as soon as we have a diagnosis.

06:18.754 --> 06:21.297
Then we should be able to cure the
infection in time to do the transplant.

06:21.423 --> 06:22.631
But you can't guarantee?

06:22.758 --> 06:25.718
We're not GM.
No recalls, no rebates.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.804
Anymore questions
while your son's life slips away?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.896
You really think
we should do this?

06:37.272 --> 06:38.522
Yes.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.484
Sorry. Your patient,
you tell them.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.448
This is your family.
It needs to be your decision.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.834
All you had to do was
say, "Yes, I do."

06:58.960 --> 07:01.253
God knows it's a phrase that you've used
often enough in your life.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.381
It was a mistake every time.
Give it a break. They said yes.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.967
That's not enough for you. You need them
to feel good about saying yes.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.888
I treat patients for months,
maybe years, not weeks, like you.

07:11.014 --> 07:11.972
I'm taller.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.724
If they don't trust me,
I can't do my job.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.519
The only value of that trust
is that you can manipulate them.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.978
You should write
greeting cards.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.898
Giving the parents a chance
to make a bad choice was a bad choice.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.274
At least it would have
been their choice.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.528
One they'd regret
at their son's funeral.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.197
Kitchen and bathrooms were immaculate.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.157
Whatever the kid's got,
he didn't get here.

07:30.617 --> 07:34.620
No, whatever the kid got, he didn't get
from the kitchen or the bathroom.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.122
Nobody cleans swing sets.

07:36.248 --> 07:39.917
Yeah, because their kid's 10
and hasn't used it since he was six.

07:40.168 --> 07:44.130
You obviously think your time could be
better spent. Why'd you come along?

07:45.257 --> 07:46.799
You feel bad about
what happened last week.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.092
I'm handling it.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.552
Think the family's gonna sue?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.054
She only had her grandparents,
and they weren't close.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.557
Well, that's good.
For you, I mean.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.143
A lawsuit makes it even harder
to put behind you.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.270
You put yours behind you?

08:00.188 --> 08:01.397
Nope.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.861
When I woke up
this morning I...

08:06.987 --> 08:09.363
I couldn't remember what she was wearing
when I admitted her.

08:10.031 --> 08:10.865
Memories fade.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.909
I killed her a week ago and I can't
remember what color top she was wearing.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.705
I was grateful when
I could wake up not thinking about her.

08:17.956 --> 08:18.789
I'm not like you.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.376
Your patient died because you were
distracted over the death of your dad.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.336
I made a calculated decision.

08:25.922 --> 08:31.093
You acted like a human being.
I acted like House.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.399
Could be Mucor or
Strongyloides in this dirt.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.403
No pulmonary symptoms,
setting well, breathing easily.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.008
Mom, I'm freezing.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.723
How long do I have to wait?

09:17.849 --> 09:20.392
Matty, we found an old water pump
in your backyard.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.435
You ever drink from it?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.312
Yeah, it was gross.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.648
We gotta test
for Mycobacteria, leptospirosis.

09:25.774 --> 09:26.941
When did you drink the water?

09:27.317 --> 09:28.525
Last summer?

09:30.445 --> 09:33.864
You sure? You haven't even taken a sip
to cool off?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.658
It was really gross.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.245
My shoulder's bugging me.
Does that matter?

09:39.704 --> 09:42.248
It could. Did you
do anything to hurt it?

09:42.374 --> 09:45.960
Just threw the ball around
the other day, for a couple hours.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.963
It's probably just a muscle ache.
Let us know if it gets worse.

09:51.549 --> 09:56.762
So soreness and stuff,
that's not 'cause I'm sick?

09:56.888 --> 09:58.430
Is something else bugging you?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.227
Sort of.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.649
- He has acute scrotum.
- Adorable.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.110
Please, I thought you
were dignified.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.321
Come on, how am I not supposed
to make that joke?

10:14.447 --> 10:18.284
Best thing about big, honking gonads,
well, one of the best things,

10:18.410 --> 10:20.869
is that there's only
a few infections that could cause it.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.288
Do urinalysis and cultures

10:22.414 --> 10:25.124
for E. coli, Klebsiella, TB,
and Brucella.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.835
Blood tests for enteroviruses
and adenoviruses.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.463
Hopefully, the needles have grown as
fast as his sack, and we can find it.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.382
Can Chase and Cameron
cover that?

10:35.552 --> 10:36.719
Mind if I ask why?

10:37.262 --> 10:40.389
I want to recheck the National Marrow
registry for an alternate donor.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.516
In case we're wrong?

10:42.809 --> 10:43.976
It's been known to happen.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.479
Fine, go.

10:53.695 --> 10:58.365
Negative for E. coli and TB.
Why is House taking it easy on Foreman?

10:58.533 --> 10:59.491
He deserves a break.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.952
Yeah, House is all about
giving breaks to people in need.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.455
No on Klebsiella.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.459
And it's Tuesday.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.421
It's got nothing to do with
Foreman or House. It's just...

11:12.630 --> 11:16.925
It's the day I remind you I like you,
and I want us to be together.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.928
Thank you, I'd forgotten.

11:22.932 --> 11:26.018
No on Brucella
and both viral antibodies.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.811
You're really gonna
do this every Tuesday?

11:27.937 --> 11:31.023
You take the day off,
I'll pick it up on Wednesday.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.777
What if we're looking for
the wrong thing?

11:34.903 --> 11:37.029
These are the only infections
that cause swollen testicles.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.907
Why don't you just say it four times now
and leave me alone for a month?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.533
Well, what if it's
not an infection?

11:41.659 --> 11:43.869
His temperature's through the roof.
There's mucous pouring out of him.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.037
I know he has an infection,

11:45.163 --> 11:47.498
but what if it didn't directly
cause the scrotum issue?

11:47.791 --> 11:52.169
What if it just caused
the thing that caused the scrotum issue?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.046
CK-MB is elevated.

11:56.007 --> 11:57.758
Slightly.
There's nothing wrong with...

11:57.967 --> 12:00.135
Indicates cardiac injury.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.639
We stuck him in that room,

12:03.765 --> 12:06.058
put his stupid, little runny-nose
infection into hyperdrive.

12:06.184 --> 12:07.518
What if it went to his heart?

12:12.941 --> 12:14.942
Pulmonary valve looks clean.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.779
Wait. Stop. Mitral valve,
there's a growth.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.784
He'll need a month
of antibiotics to clear that.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.078
His brother only has
four days to live.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.130
The infection in Matty's
mitral valve rules him out as a donor.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.131
This is perfect.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.799
We drove the infection
into his heart.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.594
Okay, perfect is too strong of a word,
but it's very, very good.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.097
Now we know
where the infection is.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.683
All we've got to do is remove
the valve, ID the infection,

12:47.809 --> 12:48.892
target and destroy it.

12:49.018 --> 12:49.852
Remove the valve?

12:49.978 --> 12:52.896
He'll be fine on antibiotics.
He doesn't need open-heart surgery.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.066
He'll be heartbroken,
on account of his dead brother.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.903
Either way he's got a dead brother.
The infection isn't just in the valve.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.405
Even with targeted medication,

13:01.531 --> 13:03.198
there's no way
we can clear his system in time.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.076
We don't have to.
We have to clear his marrow.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.412
After the surgery,
we harvest the marrow,

13:08.663 --> 13:11.874
marinate it in the targeted
antibiotic, simmer and serve.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.918
- Could work.
- It's insane.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.336
It is better than
a dead brother.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.006
I'm running this by Cuddy.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.092
Fine. Go.
In fact, let's all go.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.056
This surgery is dangerous
and life-altering,

13:28.183 --> 13:30.017
and clearly not in
the interest of our patient.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.643
It is, if he
likes his brother.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.895
We have a conflict
of interests.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.354
The parents don't.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.314
Of course they do.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.066
They already sacrificed Matty's health
to benefit his brother once.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.818
They made his cold worse.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.154
We screwed up his heart valve
by making his cold worse.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.697
Do you have anything
to add to this debate?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.407
Wilson's right.
Foreman's wrong.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.202
Your shirt is way too
revealing for the office.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.747
What do you want me to do?

13:51.956 --> 13:55.000
We should call child services and have
them appoint a guardian for Matty.

13:55.919 --> 13:56.877
No.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.339
Go explain the choices to the parents,
and don't let House bully them.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.302
House.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.137
Did he really think I was gonna do that?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.096
I didn't.

14:08.223 --> 14:10.265
- Then, why did you let him...
- I'm trying to cut him some slack.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.642
Nice of you.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.228
I think he's got the yips.

14:15.563 --> 14:19.816
Steve Blass, Scott Norwood,
David Duval all got the yips.

14:20.235 --> 14:23.820
Great athletes, lost their confidence
and immediately started sucking.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.115
And you're giving him time
to work through it?

14:28.952 --> 14:31.286
Four days, and he's fired.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.791
You don't get better
from the yips.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.170
Open-heart surgery?

14:41.256 --> 14:44.258
If you want both kids to live,
it's the only choice.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.926
Due to the valve replacement,

14:46.052 --> 14:48.887
Matty will have to be on blood thinners
to prevent potential clots.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.305
- For how long?
- Forever.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.808
He couldn't participate
in contact sports,

14:52.934 --> 14:53.892
because of the risk of hemorrhage.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.812
What about the marrow registry?
Maybe they'll find a match.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.897
Maybe they'll ride it here
on a unicorn.

14:59.023 --> 15:01.108
I'm afraid finding
a viable new donor

15:01.234 --> 15:04.528
isn't something we can
realistically depend on.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.201
Either we cripple one son,
or kill the other.

15:11.327 --> 15:16.415
He won't be able to play baseball.
That doesn't make him a cripple.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.168
What should we do?

15:28.428 --> 15:32.556
You should protect your family as a
whole. You should do the surgery.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.728
- That was awesome.
- Shut up.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.646
I gotta start
pretending to care.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.440
I did exactly what
Cuddy told us not to do.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.734
No you didn't. You did exactly
what she told me not to do.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.819
You're completely
in the clear.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.821
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.157
You're actually upset.
You just said what you believed.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.451
I also believe in patients
making their own choices.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.911
Because it lessens your guilt
if things go wrong.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.831
You're not protecting their choices.
You're soothing your conscience.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.374
By that logic, a sociopath

15:59.500 --> 16:01.918
would make the best patient
advocate in the world.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.046
Am I blushing?

16:11.596 --> 16:12.804
You ready?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.681
Yeah.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.225
Thanks.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.019
You'd do the same for me.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.448
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.825
You think I'll be better in time
to pitch in the playoffs?

16:34.952 --> 16:36.495
Maybe next season.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.251
We should have told him.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.380
He loves his brother, but if he
understood what we were asking of him...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.049
He loves his brother
more than he loves baseball.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.717
You did the right thing.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.637
Putting any part
of this decision on him...

16:54.013 --> 16:57.224
It's impossible for you guys
to deal with this.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.934
How's a 10-year-old
supposed to do it?

17:15.243 --> 17:16.952
Cannula in place.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.540
Sutures are holding.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.463
We're all set to go.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.966
Switch him over to bypass.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.465
- Yeah?
- I didn't do the surgery.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.759
You woke me up
to tell me that you're lazy?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.969
We biopsied a piece
before we started cutting.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.637
I'm tired. Get to the point.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.972
We didn't replace the valve

18:19.098 --> 18:21.725
because the growth was fibrous tissue.
It wasn't infectious.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.185
We've got to be wrong about...

18:23.311 --> 18:24.686
- Oh, God.
- What?

18:24.812 --> 18:25.729
You know what's wrong
with Matty?

18:25.855 --> 18:28.690
I think Hector's
committed suicide.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.649
What are you talking about?

18:30.026 --> 18:30.859
He took some pills.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.527
Is he alive?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.237
He ate half my stash.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.240
Of course he's...

18:43.873 --> 18:47.292
He's stoned. I'll be right in.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.925
We cut all the way
into this kid's heart,

18:55.092 --> 18:58.678
and all we got was this lousy,
non-infectious fibrous tissue.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.138
How did we miss this?

19:00.348 --> 19:03.266
Matty had a fever. He got sicker when we
suppressed his immune system.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.851
That all points to infection.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.647
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not our fault. Fibrous tissue.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.567
Something is turning
his healthy heart valve into gristle.

19:12.693 --> 19:17.405
Fibrous tissue, enlarged spleen,
fever... Could mean autoimmune.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.410
Autoimmune diseases aren't passed along
in bone marrow.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.871
He can still donate.
We confirm, I do the surgery.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.416
Lupus and Behçet's are our best bet.
Do an ANA and pathergy test.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.460
Or it could be infection.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.462
My memory's not
what it used to be,

19:32.588 --> 19:35.048
but didn't we just
rule that out eight seconds ago?

19:35.258 --> 19:36.925
Just because it's not
what screwed up his valve,

19:37.051 --> 19:38.260
it doesn't mean
it's not in his system.

19:38.386 --> 19:41.930
Uh-huh, and has the obvious
advantage of making us right all along.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.182
Little disadvantage
of making big brother dead.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.059
That's your argument? A better outcome?

19:46.185 --> 19:47.018
It fits.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.438
The family has one kid
with leukemia and one with autoimmune.

19:50.565 --> 19:51.940
I wouldn't stand next to them
in a rain storm.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.150
That's your argument?
It sucks for them?

19:54.277 --> 19:56.361
It fits, and we can
still help big brother.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.905
National Marrow Registry
came up with four out of six donors.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.491
Six out of six is two better
than four out of six, right?

20:01.617 --> 20:03.285
I mean, I know two
is so small,

20:03.411 --> 20:05.787
but since it means that he's gonna get
Graft-Versus-Host Disease,

20:05.913 --> 20:09.457
the marrow will attack his body,
and he'll die a painful death.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.044
Find out what
autoimmune it is.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.971
Is this autoimmune better or worse
than the new heart valve?

20:23.097 --> 20:24.931
It depends on which autoimmune
it is.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.808
With early detection,
most are manageable.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.184
How long will testing take?

20:28.311 --> 20:29.644
That's the other good thing
about this.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.688
There's literally
thousands of possible infections,

20:31.814 --> 20:33.732
but only a handful of
autoimmune conditions.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.567
We'll have the answer
in a few hours.

20:35.693 --> 20:36.776
Hey, Doctor?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.448
Is this bad?

20:50.082 --> 20:51.917
Wanna catch a movie?

20:52.043 --> 20:53.168
It's one in the morning.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.961
I know a place.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.923
Although, I wouldn't recommend
wearing those shoes.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.509
How exactly does a dog
unscrew a bottle of pills?

21:01.677 --> 21:02.719
Is that a riddle?

21:02.845 --> 21:04.220
It requires
an opposable thumb.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.388
I must have left it off.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.556
On the floor?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.141
I think he hopped up
onto the bathroom counter.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.643
He has arthritis.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.775
- Not me this time.
- No! It's your damn dog.

21:17.944 --> 21:22.072
He chews everything. I was missing
a file. Found paper in his stool.

21:22.198 --> 21:25.200
An original Sun Record 78
Elvis recording, gone.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.036
Who the hell chews vinyl?
He's vindictive.

21:29.080 --> 21:32.290
He's had a good, long life.
It's his time.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.708
Are you okay?

21:33.918 --> 21:36.878
I just tripped over
Wilson's self-righteousness.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.255
What do you got?

21:39.674 --> 21:41.967
Matty's negative for everything.
It's not autoimmune.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.426
So, we're back to infection.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.637
Nick's starting
to deteriorate fast.

21:45.763 --> 21:46.930
He's got bruising
all over his arms.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.264
His capillaries
are leaking blood.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.933
If it happens in his brain,
he's dead.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.602
We've got to go
with the four-out-of-six donor.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.897
Did I mention my concerns
about four being less than six?

21:56.440 --> 21:58.984
Wilson's first wife
ignored a similar issue.

21:59.110 --> 22:01.361
Of course, that time,
it was only fatal to their marriage.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.239
It's either that, or we start
randomly testing Matty for infections.

22:04.365 --> 22:05.949
I know how you hate
the word "random."

22:06.075 --> 22:09.786
Do it alphabetically. We're not doing
that damn transplant.

22:10.955 --> 22:11.997
Where's Foreman?

22:12.123 --> 22:13.748
We've found a donor.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.711
It's not an ideal match, but four out
of six still gives Nick a chance.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.763
A partial match transplant
is extremely dangerous.

22:28.889 --> 22:29.806
Doctor Foreman explained...

22:29.932 --> 22:33.685
Did he also explain what sort of pain
your son will experience

22:33.811 --> 22:36.521
- if he gets Graft-Versus-Host Disease?
- Yes.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.982
Apparently, he didn't explain it
vividly enough.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.066
Let me give it a whack...

22:40.317 --> 22:42.527
He also explained that if we did
nothing,

22:42.653 --> 22:45.030
Nick could start
bleeding into his brain.

22:45.156 --> 22:49.117
Matty is a perfect match. Just give us
a little more time to figure out...

22:49.243 --> 22:50.285
How much time?

22:50.411 --> 22:52.162
Doctor House is
the best diagnostician...

22:52.288 --> 22:53.997
How much time?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.708
I don't know.

22:57.126 --> 23:01.463
And Nick can start bleeding into
his brain without any warning?

23:01.589 --> 23:04.466
Yes, but the chances of
complications from a mismatch are...

23:04.592 --> 23:06.342
My boys have suffered enough.

23:07.011 --> 23:08.178
Get Matty better,

23:08.596 --> 23:12.640
and give Nick the transplant
from the new donor.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.148
Foreman screwed us.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.609
No, you screwed us.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.862
What is the point in being able
to control people

23:25.988 --> 23:27.822
if you won't actually do it?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.784
It's like training a dog and
letting him go on your rug,

23:30.910 --> 23:31.743
which, by the way...

23:31.869 --> 23:33.661
Once Foreman got his mitts
on them, well, there was no way...

23:33.788 --> 23:37.540
You don't explain chances
and probabilities, you lie to them.

23:37.666 --> 23:40.502
You tell them Foreman's a moron, which
isn't even much of a lie right now.

23:40.628 --> 23:41.461
You've got to talk to him.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.837
I've got no problem
with what Foreman did.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.923
He undercut us,
and he may have cost that kid his life.

23:45.049 --> 23:48.259
Foreman did what he thought was right.
You, on the other hand, sucked out.

23:48.969 --> 23:49.803
When the decision
really mattered,

23:49.929 --> 23:51.846
you didn't have the guts
to tell them what to do.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.724
If that kid dies,
it's because Foreman was wrong,

23:54.850 --> 23:56.184
and because you're a coward.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.929
Oh, goodness,
I've left my door open.

24:33.639 --> 24:40.186
My poor dog must have run away and been
hit by a car or a truck or a train.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.230
Or an anvil.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.118
Thank God, you're still here.

24:55.953 --> 24:57.537
He's still here!

25:01.584 --> 25:02.417
Where's my stereo?

25:30.279 --> 25:32.155
How are you feeling?

25:32.281 --> 25:33.281
A little itchy.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.534
It's weird, huh?

25:37.077 --> 25:40.121
You still have no idea
what's wrong with me,

25:40.247 --> 25:41.748
but those meds will
make me better.

25:42.041 --> 25:46.336
We put you on a variety of medications
that will fight all kinds of infections.

25:47.588 --> 25:51.674
Nick, you know exactly
what's wrong with him,

25:51.800 --> 25:53.509
but maybe he's gonna die,
anyway.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.094
Hopefully,
the new marrow will...

25:55.262 --> 25:56.721
I can't go in there, can I?

26:01.685 --> 26:03.144
Your infection would kill him.

26:04.563 --> 26:09.609
So, I won't be able to
be with him when he dies?

26:10.736 --> 26:13.780
You'll be able to be with him
when he gets better.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.576
What's wrong?

26:18.702 --> 26:19.827
It really itches.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.255
Hello?

26:42.726 --> 26:44.686
Why am I meeting you here?

26:44.812 --> 26:47.939
You're paying for my new cane.
It was your dog.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.276
So, that's it?
You call me a coward, life goes on?

26:51.402 --> 26:53.736
Apparently. You showed up.

26:55.739 --> 26:56.906
Hey.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.786
I'm sorry.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.422
You're pathetic.
I didn't actually mean that.

27:12.589 --> 27:15.300
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't to infinity.

27:15.426 --> 27:16.551
Yes, you did.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.511
- You're pathetic.
- Yeah?

27:19.346 --> 27:20.513
When?

27:21.640 --> 27:23.641
What did the labs say?

27:29.690 --> 27:32.025
Why don't you buy your cane
at a medical supply store

27:32.151 --> 27:33.276
like a normal cripple?

27:33.402 --> 27:34.902
Fewer bitching choices.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.197
Okay. What do you got
in bitching?

27:38.532 --> 27:39.657
Right this way.

27:40.743 --> 27:41.576
That was Cameron.

27:41.702 --> 27:44.954
The kid that wasn't all that
sick is now all that sick.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.040
- He's bleeding out of his ears.
- Blood counts?

27:47.166 --> 27:48.458
Down.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.834
Schistocytes on the smear?

27:50.252 --> 27:53.796
His body's not making new blood cells.
His bone marrow's crashing.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.423
This is
one of our top sellers.

27:56.633 --> 27:59.427
It's a little too Marilyn Manson
in a retirement home.

28:00.220 --> 28:01.929
The meds are suppressing
his bone marrow.

28:02.056 --> 28:04.182
Or the infection's doing it.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.392
Pretty cool.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.937
Genuine bull penis,
stretched over a metal rod.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.275
Penis canes are murder.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.277
Right.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.071
Let me see the one on the end.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.072
You got it.

28:19.490 --> 28:20.865
We need to stop Matty's meds.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.077
If the marrow rebounds, it's the meds.
If it doesn't, it's an infection.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.495
And if it's the infection?

28:25.621 --> 28:28.206
Maybe I was wrong
about which kid's gonna die.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.005
Bitching.

28:56.527 --> 28:57.944
Flames?

28:58.529 --> 29:02.031
It makes it look like I'm going fast.
Now, how's our dying kids?

29:02.324 --> 29:04.283
Nick's developed blisters
all over his feet and legs.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.494
He's got grade four
Graft-Versus-Host.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.287
Increase his dosage
of methylprednisolone.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.206
Already did. It's not working.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.000
Feeling guilty?

29:14.002 --> 29:15.420
I did the right thing.

29:15.546 --> 29:16.921
Always a comfort.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.174
Okay, what's
the other kid's status?

29:20.300 --> 29:21.217
We're done with Nick?

29:21.427 --> 29:22.718
God is done with Nick.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.554
We know what he has.
We know how to treat it.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.932
We're doing it, it's not working.
Life is for the living.

29:28.058 --> 29:29.976
Matty's been off his meds
for a few hours,

29:30.102 --> 29:31.477
but his blood count's still tanking.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.771
Means the meds aren't to blame.
It's the infection.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.859
If we don't get this under control, his
blood will literally turn into water.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.031
Cultures still
aren't growing anything.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.032
Why not?

29:45.159 --> 29:49.412
Because you did the right thing.
Convinced the parents to treat the kid.

29:49.538 --> 29:51.456
All you did was yank the weed
out of the ground.

29:51.582 --> 29:55.084
Its roots are still killing their
beautiful lawn. We just can't see it.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.919
If we can't see it,
we don't know what it is.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.796
If we don't know what it is,
we can't kill it.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.634
So we got to wait for it
to grow back again.

30:04.178 --> 30:06.471
Now, the soil is arid.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.725
So both he and his brother
will be dead by the time...

30:16.773 --> 30:20.568
What if the dandelion
was in fertile soil?

30:21.737 --> 30:24.489
What if we take the roots
from Matty, and put them in Nick?

30:24.615 --> 30:26.908
Turn the kid into
a petri dish, only better.

30:27.034 --> 30:28.826
A petri dish can't
tell you when it hurts.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.912
You want to give him
his brother's infection?

30:31.038 --> 30:33.664
The very thing we've been trying to
avoid since the brother sneezed?

30:33.790 --> 30:36.667
- Leukemia kid's got no defenses.
- Which is why he'll die.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.712
But before he does,
the infection will spread fast.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.049
Fast enough to tell us
what it is, in time to save his brother.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.806
Do you see any other way?

30:53.310 --> 30:57.313
The infection
is decimating Matty's bone marrow.

30:57.439 --> 31:04.237
But if we give that marrow to Nick, his
symptoms could let us diagnose Matty.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.656
- But, it'll kill Nick.
- Yes.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.908
You're...

31:09.034 --> 31:11.410
You're saying we should
kill one son to save the other?

31:11.537 --> 31:12.745
Nick is gonna die either way.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.956
You don't know that. I mean,
he's in pain right now, but...

31:15.082 --> 31:17.792
Nick's Graft-Versus-Host
is not responding to medication.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.835
That can change.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.256
Maybe he... He'll rally.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.133
Hey, my Nick is a fighter.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.010
Graft-Versus-Host
isn't gonna go away

31:28.136 --> 31:30.846
because of Nick's sunny smile
and positive outlook.

31:30.973 --> 31:34.183
Nick has survived
three reoccurrences of his leukemia.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.519
He's being torn apart
from the inside out.

31:36.812 --> 31:40.022
His pain's gonna get worse
and worse, until he dies.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.066
You're just dragging it out.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.278
You have only
one decision to make.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.780
You can leave here
with one dead son, or two.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.414
Tell them.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.712
You should let us do this.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.014
No!

32:17.686 --> 32:20.021
We're not giving up on Nick.

32:22.274 --> 32:23.774
Not!

32:38.624 --> 32:42.293
The patient's parents apparently
don't want to be parents anymore.

32:42.586 --> 32:46.297
You're a sneaky bastard.
Any ideas how we get around this?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.299
- Court order?
- It's hardly sneaky.

32:48.467 --> 32:49.842
We can still save Matty.

32:50.010 --> 32:52.720
Run more tests, find out what infection
is destroying his marrow.

32:52.846 --> 32:56.098
Ten-thousand possible infections,
at least 20 minutes per test.

32:56.224 --> 32:57.683
It'll take you
approximately eight years.

32:57.809 --> 33:01.354
Actually, four months, assuming the last
one I test is the right one,

33:01.480 --> 33:03.939
and, if it's the first, it will take me
approximately 20 minutes.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.858
He's right. It's worth a shot.

33:05.984 --> 33:09.570
He's timid. Testing blindly is not gonna
save this kid.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.947
But standing around here will.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.605
Wow, he sure is hurting.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.400
The nurses say he maxed out
on his pain meds.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.361
If I had a nickel for
every time I heard that...

33:54.658 --> 33:56.158
Pharmacy's
on the ground floor.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.995
I'm gonna go get you
some more pain medication, okay?

34:00.122 --> 34:01.831
Thank you.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.682
It's not gonna help.

34:22.144 --> 34:23.602
You're dying.

34:23.729 --> 34:27.898
Nothing's gonna change that. These drugs
will just make you go easier.

34:28.442 --> 34:29.692
I know.

34:31.027 --> 34:34.864
Fourteen years on the planet,
most of them spent suffering.

34:36.616 --> 34:41.328
Dying before you even
got to drive a car,

34:41.455 --> 34:44.290
take off a girl's bra,
drink a beer.

34:46.209 --> 34:49.211
Believe me, there's plenty
you haven't done.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.255
Really good stuff.

34:54.468 --> 34:57.511
Must make it hard
to believe in God,

34:57.637 --> 35:01.891
or fairness, larger purpose.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.564
But your life
doesn't have to be meaningless.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.066
You can save your brother.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.738
How?

35:18.825 --> 35:20.284
Negative for CMV.

35:20.410 --> 35:21.827
Negative for amoebas.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.913
House called you timid.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.748
He's called me a lot worse.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.918
To him, there is nothing worse.
He's gonna fire you.

35:29.044 --> 35:30.920
Even if we run 100 tests,

35:31.046 --> 35:33.380
that only gives us a one percent chance
of saving these kids.

35:33.507 --> 35:35.466
Better than zero.
You don't care if you get fired?

35:35.592 --> 35:36.592
I don't know.

35:36.718 --> 35:39.637
There's got to be a way to better our
odds from a 99-percent chance of death.

35:39.763 --> 35:40.805
You've got to know.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.224
It's not food-borne, because no one else
in the family is sick.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.892
You either care about
your job, or you don't.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.561
And Matty's the only one who drank from
that water pump in the back yard,

35:47.687 --> 35:49.188
and we eliminated Pseudomonas
and cholera.

35:49.314 --> 35:52.566
If you care, you fight to keep it.
If you don't, you quit.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.945
I thought they lived
in the suburbs.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.030
They do. Why?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.448
And they've got a water pump?

36:04.538 --> 36:06.163
Please, I...
I want to do it.

36:06.331 --> 36:10.000
No, Nicky,
it's not your decision.

36:10.877 --> 36:14.046
I'm dying. There's nothing
that's gonna change that.

36:14.172 --> 36:20.094
Hey, hey, hey. Don't say that. Okay?
You can't give up.

36:20.554 --> 36:22.596
It's time for me to go, Dad.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.100
You got to let me go.

36:29.062 --> 36:30.771
No.

36:33.441 --> 36:34.859
Please, son.

36:36.653 --> 36:41.657
I can't... I can't...
I can't!

36:43.493 --> 36:48.080
Let me do it for Matty.
Let me do it for you guys.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.251
So you won't be alone.

37:02.345 --> 37:05.514
- Are you sure?
- No, but he is.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.186
Get Nick back
to the clean room.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.938
The parents agreed
to infect him.

37:13.064 --> 37:16.775
We figured out
what's wrong with Matty, histoplasmosis.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.611
Well, what is that?
I mean, why did it...

37:18.737 --> 37:20.779
Fungal infection.
It grows in chicken feces.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.823
The dirt that Matty used
to build his pitcher's mound

37:22.949 --> 37:24.575
must have sat under
a chicken coop.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.411
Your whole neighborhood
was built on top of farmland.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.496
We didn't test for it earlier,
because we didn't...

37:29.706 --> 37:31.916
Can you fix him?

37:32.042 --> 37:35.085
Full course of amphotericin
and he should be fine.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.715
And Nick?
I mean, can you clean Matty's marrow?

37:40.008 --> 37:42.051
Just like you were talking about doing
it, but do it fast,

37:43.136 --> 37:44.929
and get it into Nick.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.724
I'm sorry, the reason
Matty is so sick

37:48.850 --> 37:52.102
is because the infection
is attacking his marrow.

37:52.228 --> 37:57.024
He doesn't have enough left to safely
take from him and give to his brother.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.284
I'm gonna get better now?
That's it?

38:07.911 --> 38:09.203
That's it.

38:09.329 --> 38:10.746
And what about Nick?

38:17.212 --> 38:20.839
Your brother was willing
to risk his life to save you.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.883
Are you willing to
do that for him?

38:24.803 --> 38:27.930
I can't sedate you.
You're too sick.

39:07.262 --> 39:12.516
Please, please stop. Please.
Please. You're done, right?

39:12.642 --> 39:15.019
Sorry, I need a lot more.

39:15.937 --> 39:18.439
No, stop! Stop!

39:29.075 --> 39:31.285
How much heat are you taking
from the parents?

39:31.411 --> 39:32.494
They're calming down.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.079
I think it has something to do
with both their kids

39:34.205 --> 39:36.915
being alive, awake, and eating.

39:37.042 --> 39:38.917
The marrow transplant took.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.462
Welcome back, Foreman.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.713
You should talk to him.

39:42.839 --> 39:43.839
Tell him how proud I am?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.883
Hey, if you're ashamed of him,
tell him that.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.594
Pride and shame only apply to people

39:48.720 --> 39:51.972
we have a vested interest in,
not employees.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.183
How many hours a day
do you have to spend with someone

39:54.309 --> 39:55.684
before they're
basically family?

39:55.810 --> 39:56.977
Good point.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.604
But, first, I've got to tell
Cameron and Chase

39:58.730 --> 40:00.189
that
they're violating God's will.

40:00.315 --> 40:04.276
I'm just asking you to have
an adult conversation to let him know...

40:04.402 --> 40:06.737
That he did a good job?
He knows it.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.615
Adults don't need adult
conversations,

40:09.741 --> 40:11.909
just like I
don't need this conversation.

40:12.452 --> 40:13.869
Have you killed Hector yet?

40:14.120 --> 40:15.412
Obviously not.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.208
Oh. He's quiet. He's...

40:21.002 --> 40:23.128
Is that my stethoscope?

40:24.339 --> 40:25.672
Bad dog.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.968
Listen...

40:30.970 --> 40:34.807
Bonnie joined her homeowner's
association and staged a coup.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.517
Pets are now allowed.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.269
Oh.

40:39.479 --> 40:40.813
If you want to keep him,

40:40.939 --> 40:43.524
she wants a new puppy anyway.
She'll understand.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.734
Why would I want to keep him?

40:45.860 --> 40:47.486
You're sure?

40:50.657 --> 40:52.032
Come on, boy.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.837
Accidents happen.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.216
Candy?

41:11.803 --> 41:38.162
Good boy.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.765
You did good.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.020
I did what you would have.

42:04.606 --> 42:06.940
Well, maybe I'm biased, but...

42:07.066 --> 42:08.233
I tortured the kid.

42:08.359 --> 42:10.611
Because you knew it was right.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.989
You knew you were
saving his brother.

42:14.115 --> 42:15.490
I know.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.785
I don't like that I know.

42:19.787 --> 42:22.873
I hate that I can listen
to a kid screaming in pain

42:22.999 --> 42:26.919
and not even take a moment to question
whether I'm doing the right thing.

42:27.629 --> 42:30.756
I hate that in order
to be like you, as a doctor,

42:30.882 --> 42:33.634
I have to be like you
as a human being.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.512
I don't want to turn into you.

42:40.767 --> 42:41.975
You're not.

42:43.394 --> 42:47.022
You've been like me
since you were eight years old.
