00:14.347 --> 00:16.182
So he just cut you off?

00:16.266 --> 00:17.475
No communication.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.270
Guys aren't great
with communication when they're mad.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.396
Hey…

00:21.479 --> 00:23.773
Benoît's not mad. He's done.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.067
That's what's hurtful
and hard to understand.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.529
If he was feeling insecure
about Nicolas or whatever,

00:29.612 --> 00:30.697
just, let's talk.

00:30.780 --> 00:33.908
I'm sure he's going to write
a great song about it someday.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.535
That is so annoying.

00:35.618 --> 00:36.870
I honestly feel you.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.080
I've got my own
communication issues going on.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.458
With Antoine.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.168
Are you guys having boy trouble?

00:43.668 --> 00:47.714
Listen, Antoine and I aren't
on the same page when it comes to money.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.757
Hmm?

00:48.840 --> 00:51.009
He likes to spend it
and not worry about it.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.053
I'm spending
all my time worrying about it.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.512
You sound like my father.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.016
In business, you have to spend money
to make money, right?

00:58.099 --> 01:00.435
True. We're about
to launch his new fragrance.

01:01.519 --> 01:04.355
We could just really use some fresh cash.

01:04.439 --> 01:08.151
[gasps] Nicolas just texted me… again.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.153
Wait, do you…

01:10.236 --> 01:12.655
Do you think he could actually be into me?

01:16.576 --> 01:17.619
Oh, he's hot, too.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.372
Okay, well, mourning period's
officially over.

[cell phone chimes]

01:37.138 --> 01:38.765
Just walked by Sylvie's office,

01:38.848 --> 01:42.477
and she was being very polite
to someone on the phone.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.645

Oh, my God.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.938
[in English]
That's never good.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.065
[Sylvie] Bad news.

01:47.649 --> 01:51.736
The hilltop fortress that promised to host
our McLaren experience dropped out.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.738
We're a week out. They can't do that.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.031
Well, they did.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.243
Some cultural minister wants it
for a classical music concert.

01:58.910 --> 02:02.789
So we have to
find a venue near the Grand Prix

02:02.872 --> 02:04.582
suitable for a list of VIPs.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.167
Fast.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.293
How?

02:07.877 --> 02:10.964
How? We'll never find anything better.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.216
That fortress was in a Bond film.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.386
What about a race track?

02:16.469 --> 02:19.347
With a week's notice,
we'd be lucky to get a dog track.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.351
[gasps]

02:25.395 --> 02:26.896
Are we bothering you, Emily?

02:27.522 --> 02:28.356
What?

02:28.439 --> 02:29.399
No. Sorry.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.318
Apparently, Antoine owns
a chateau in Provence?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.736
Actually, a bastide.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.613
Why are we talking about this?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.533
Let me show you something.

Oh! Uh…

Lucky girl.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.666
No, Antoine's place.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.586
Yes, I know it well,
it's certainly impressive.

02:50.044 --> 02:53.006
Isn't the special-edition McLaren
that we're promoting lavender?

02:53.923 --> 02:57.552
What's a more perfect place
to be showcasing this car than here?

02:57.635 --> 03:02.140
The 10th-century medieval fortress
that was in a Bond movie!

03:02.223 --> 03:05.560
Maybe he'll throw in your chef
for the event, you know?

03:05.643 --> 03:08.563
The one you have that
"will they or won't they" thing with.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.857
-They won't.
-But they did.

03:10.940 --> 03:11.816
Shh!

03:12.483 --> 03:13.526
I like it.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.864
We can keep the fees in-house,
it'll be good exposure for Antoine. <i>Bravo.</i>

03:19.032 --> 03:22.118
Speaking of exposure, can you swipe back?

[jazz music playing]

03:33.504 --> 03:34.881
Emily saves the day again.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.967
And a free trip for us to Provence.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.636
-It's a work trip.
-Whatever.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.512
Guys, I'm so jealous.

03:41.596 --> 03:42.722
Provence is gorgeous.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.265
You're not coming with us?

03:44.349 --> 03:47.227
Yeah, I thought we could make it
like a couples thing.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.480
I wish. But this is
the last weekend of Sofia's show.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.689
I have so much to do.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.525
I didn't realize
that Sofia was still in town.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.611
Yeah, the show is a huge success.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.863
I'm just sad
there are only a few days left.

04:01.407 --> 04:03.701
This is a rough draft
of the menu for McLaren.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.204
I was thinking about keeping it
earthy, organic.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.666
So maybe some saffron-marinated lamb
with rosewater beetroot.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.209
And for dessert,

04:11.292 --> 04:13.628
raspberry mille-feuille
with a bit of lavender.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.339
The lavender's genius.
I love a local tie in.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.508
They'll be so impressed.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.926
Of course they will.

Look after our man for me,
won't you, Emily?

Yup. All set.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.295
and we might even get some time

at L'Esprit du Luberon.

04:58.923 --> 04:59.757
What's that?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.593
It's a Michelin-star restaurant.
I've always wanted to try it.

if everything's on track.

I hope you'll be comfortable
in the guest room for a change.

Of course, Catherine. I'll manage.

and it ended well before we met.

here before. With him?

and way better company.

we'll have to cut the tour short.

but leaves more room for error.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.974
There's not such a big difference.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.517
[in French] Of course, you're not a nose.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.060
My reputation is on the line.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.564
Antoine, if you stayed around
a little longer to oversee,

12:54.148 --> 12:56.275
maybe we wouldn't be in such a mess. Okay?

12:56.358 --> 12:57.860
Instead of playing restauranteur…

12:57.943 --> 12:59.779
<i>"Monsieur"</i> plays restauranteur in Paris!

12:59.862 --> 13:00.780
Crazy.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.073
[in English] We need to start over.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.825
With the original batch as our control,

13:04.909 --> 13:06.285
we'll replicate it correctly.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.746
That sounds pretty expensive.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.332
-Cost doesn't matter.
-Of course it does.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.418
Maybe we can dump it to a wholesaler. No?

13:14.502 --> 13:16.045
[Antoine] To become what?

13:16.128 --> 13:17.463
A Victoria's Secret body spray?

13:17.546 --> 13:18.464
Why not?

13:18.547 --> 13:20.216
[in French] Bernard, my office!

13:23.844 --> 13:27.473
[in English] Don't let him roll over you
like he did with the last CFO.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.687
Shit.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.695
I can't have another bite.

13:42.613 --> 13:43.447
Me neither.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.451
[in French] I hope everything
was to your liking?

13:47.535 --> 13:50.120
Chef Olivier. It was perfect.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.040
[in English] This is Emily.
And I'm Gabriel.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.667
Everything was fabulous.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.920
Thank you. And so many people
like to sit on the bag stool.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.338
Don't worry about it, huh?

13:59.421 --> 14:00.714
Oh, my God, you saw that?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.133
[chuckles nervously]

14:03.217 --> 14:04.969
I heard so much about your cooking,

14:05.052 --> 14:08.472
but nothing prepared me
for how incredible this was going to be.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.391
Thank you.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.685
[in French] Papa, Papa, can we go play?

14:13.477 --> 14:15.479
Yes. Did you finish your lunch?

14:16.063 --> 14:17.064
[chuckles]

14:18.107 --> 14:20.317
[in English] <i>Merci.</i> No, it's okay.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.694
I'm glad you enjoyed the food.

14:21.777 --> 14:23.445
I wish my kids felt the same.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.947
They're so adorable.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.824
Yes, well, when they choose to be.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.909
[both chuckle]

14:29.493 --> 14:32.329
Chef, I have myself a restaurant in Paris…

14:33.747 --> 14:35.666
Honestly, you've figured it all out.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.837
Beautiful restaurant in the country
with kids running around…

14:40.337 --> 14:43.340
I can't help but wonder,
how do you balance it all?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.010
Well, the kids, they force you to.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.470
Without them it'd be all work, no play.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.641
But, you know,
you two will figure it out as well.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.893
When the time comes.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.145
And if your kids like your cooking,

14:56.228 --> 14:58.188
come back and tell me your secret.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.694
Oh, my God, he thinks we're together too.

15:03.777 --> 15:06.155
He also thinks
my kids won't enjoy my cooking.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.489
He has no idea.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.491
[in French] There you go, sir.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.784
<i>-Merci.</i>
<i>-Merci.</i>

15:10.868 --> 15:11.785
[Gabriel in English]
No, please.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.204
-I invited you.
-No, this one's on Antoine.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.709
I think he left us some notes.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.754
[reading in French]

15:23.547 --> 15:26.342
[in English] "What a pleasure
to serve such a lovely couple."

15:28.010 --> 15:29.345
Huh. Well…

15:30.638 --> 15:32.097
We sure fooled him.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.057
Uh-huh.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.654
I'm gonna miss having you at the gallery.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.614
And in your hotel room.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.659
[Sofia] And in the taxi yesterday.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.160
[Camille chuckles]

15:59.375 --> 16:00.751
I don't want to leave.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.628
I don't want you to leave either.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.966
Maybe I can get the gallery
to extend the show.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.719
Come to Greece with me.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.307
I'll be on Hydra.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.060
So many wonderful artists live there,

16:18.143 --> 16:20.270
and I can show you
the next piece I'm working on.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.814
I would love to,

16:21.897 --> 16:24.733
and I'd love to get away from Paris
to spend more time--

16:24.817 --> 16:25.818
So you'll come?

16:27.611 --> 16:29.571
Sofia, you know I have a boyfriend.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.866
Yes. Who is so busy
he won't even notice you're gone.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.453
And who I do love very much.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.043
It's not "either or," Camille.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.880
Are we really here
to just love one person?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.134
[jazz music playing]

17:14.533 --> 17:18.162
<i>Bienvenue</i> to the McLaren Experience.
May I have your name?

17:18.662 --> 17:19.538
Theodule.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.623
Deedle-do?

17:23.000 --> 17:23.959
The-odule.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.045
That's such a lovely name.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.755
Would you mind pointing it out?

17:27.838 --> 17:28.672
Yeah.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.092
Okay.

17:33.761 --> 17:34.595
Theodule.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.222
Oh, Ted! Got it.

17:37.723 --> 17:38.724
[chuckles]

17:51.111 --> 17:52.654
[in French] The car…

17:53.989 --> 17:56.366
[in English] Why don't you
let me hold that.

17:57.076 --> 17:57.993
Go ahead.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.164
Oh, gorgeous.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.626
Make sure you delete that one.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.586
[cell phone chimes]

18:09.797 --> 18:10.798
Oh.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.593
I have to go take care of something.
Can you handle this?

18:14.676 --> 18:15.511
Of course.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
All right.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.349
Big smile. Yeah.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.517
All right, very good.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.560
-Thanks.
-Where's my glass?

18:27.731 --> 18:29.650
I hope your day was better than mine.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.735
We've got a full-scale disaster
on our hands.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.070
What? Why?

18:33.153 --> 18:34.404
The juice went bad.

18:35.155 --> 18:37.199
-Juice?
-It's what they call the perfume.

18:37.282 --> 18:38.408
It got ruined somehow.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.412
There's one small batch that's good,
and whole vats that we can't use.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.749
-I mean, the timing couldn't be worse.
-Oh, my God, that stinks.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.835
Sorry. Poor choice of words.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.130
You've got a problem of your own
heading your way.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.050
Do your thing.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.385
I'll be over here

18:56.468 --> 18:58.720
toasting to the shortest job
I've ever had.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.056
<i>Merci.</i>

19:02.015 --> 19:02.850
Hi.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.687
Emily, show me the list.
Is my husband invited to this event?

19:07.771 --> 19:10.649
It's all French names.
There's like 20 Laurents.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.526
[in French]
Shit.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.195
[in English]
I should've known he'd be invited.

19:15.696 --> 19:19.408
Every McLaren owner in the South
has been to his club in St. Tropez.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.494
Oh. <i>Bienvenue</i> to the McLaren experience.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.204
[in French]
Your name, please?

19:25.164 --> 19:28.083
[in English] I'll handle this.
Say hello to the McLaren executive.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.419
-[in French] Your name, please?
-Endeng.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.337
It's good.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.345
[in English] A pleasure meeting you both.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.889
-Excuse me, Tim Davies?
-Yes?

19:41.972 --> 19:43.724
Now there's a name I can pronounce.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.059
Emily Cooper from Agence Grateau.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.896
Emily. So nice to meet you.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.314
Everything's just perfect.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.733
Thank you for making things
so spectacular.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.152
Of course,
it had to be as special as your car.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.237
Especially this one. First of its kind.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.948
High-powered sports car
with the fuel efficiency of a hybrid.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.367
Since we only made
a few hundred of them,

20:02.451 --> 20:05.120
it's "exclusive"
and car collectors want them more.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.830
How do you decide who gets one?

20:07.331 --> 20:09.917
They're carefully allocated
to our best customers.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.920
Once they hit the open market,
prices really go crazy.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.380
-Scarcity creates demand.
-Mmm.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.799
Exactly. If you have the right product.

20:17.883 --> 20:18.884
Mmm.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.469
Will you excuse me?

20:26.975 --> 20:28.227
[jazz musiz playing]

20:28.310 --> 20:30.229
[camera shutter clicking]

20:38.487 --> 20:39.404
[in French]
It's good.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.656
Have a good evening.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.957
[Erik in English] You've got
to be kidding me.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.544
[in French] Your name?

20:56.672 --> 20:57.756
Laurent Grateau.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.383
[chuckles]

20:59.508 --> 21:01.385
Sorry, you're not on the list.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.595
Really?

21:05.764 --> 21:07.766
May I speak to your boss?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.476
Emily? Is that her name?

21:09.559 --> 21:11.186
[laughs sarcastically] Very funny.

21:11.853 --> 21:13.730
Why didn't you tell me you'd be here?

21:13.814 --> 21:15.315
I assumed you knew.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.150
Didn't you invite me?

21:17.234 --> 21:20.112
Honestly, I didn't realize we did.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.156
-And tonight might not be the best--
-Laurent.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.495
[in English] You have an interesting way
of popping up everywhere.

21:30.998 --> 21:31.915
Hello, Erik.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.583
Nice to see you too.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.837
How cute. The two of you working together.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.756
Why don't you grab yourself
a glass of champagne

21:39.840 --> 21:41.675
and say hello to the car? Hmm?

21:42.217 --> 21:43.135
Sure.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.137
Thank you for having me.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.057
Even if you didn't intend to.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.438
Sylvie, what is this?

21:54.521 --> 21:56.898
He was just at your apartment
and now he's here?

21:57.858 --> 22:00.819
I'm just as surprised
to see him as you are, Erik.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.738
I don't understand.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.991
You're married to him
and having an affair with me

22:06.074 --> 22:10.329
or you're in a relationship with me
having an affair with your husband.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.540
I'm not having an affair
with anyone, Erik.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.667
Then why are you still married?

22:21.214 --> 22:23.133
You said you were a photographer once.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.551
Where are you going?

22:25.677 --> 22:26.636
Back to Paris.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.013
What?

22:28.096 --> 22:29.056
Erik.

22:29.973 --> 22:30.807
Erik!

22:32.225 --> 22:33.393
Fuck. Erik!

22:33.977 --> 22:36.897
I hired you to support me
in these situations, not my wife.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.732
You hired me
because I'm good at what I do.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.108
I'm not picking sides.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.319
I'm advising you on how to make a profit,

22:42.402 --> 22:44.696
and we shouldn't
scrap this entire production.

22:46.782 --> 22:47.783
<i>Bonsoir,</i> Antoine.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.952
I hope you don't mind,
but I heard what happened at the factory.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.412
[chuckles]

22:52.871 --> 22:53.789
Terrific.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.625
So my new CFO is untrustworthy
and indiscreet.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.669
Sorry. I assumed she's part of the team.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.421
That's for me to decide.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.299
I promise I'll never speak to her
about anything again.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.468
Actually, this is my fault.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.303
I tortured it out of him.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.348
But it sounds more like an opportunity
than a problem to me.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.225
Oh.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.393
And how is that?

23:15.435 --> 23:17.604
Release what you have
as a limited-edition perfume

23:17.687 --> 23:19.523
like what McLaren's doing tonight.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.526
It all comes down
to the quality of the fragrance.

23:22.609 --> 23:25.153
Put it in an amazing bottle
and make it available

23:25.237 --> 23:27.364
only to your best customers, at a premium.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.492
Once it hits the open market,
the price could go crazy.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.036
[Antoine] Hmm.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.750
Thank you for explaining to me
the simple law of supply and demand.

23:40.043 --> 23:41.378
Next stop, the World Bank.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.259
That wasn't good, was it?

23:47.342 --> 23:48.218
No, love.

23:49.469 --> 23:50.595
Not good at all.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.391
[Alfie sighs]

23:59.438 --> 24:02.482
[people chattering indistinctly]

24:04.651 --> 24:06.653
[glass clinking]

24:09.322 --> 24:10.532
Thank you for being here

24:10.615 --> 24:13.493
at the McLaren experience weekend
hosted by Maison Lavaux.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.412
[all applauding]

24:16.788 --> 24:17.789
Whoo!

24:20.041 --> 24:21.418
So honored you chose us to host.

24:21.501 --> 24:23.295
-No, thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.630
Honored to be paid to rescue your event.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.549
In the spirit of our new friendship,

24:28.049 --> 24:30.844
and inspired by
the limited-edition purple McLaren,

24:31.344 --> 24:34.097
I'm thrilled to announce that
Maison Lavaux will be introducing

24:34.181 --> 24:36.516
its own limited-edition purple fragrance,

24:36.600 --> 24:37.934
Lavande de Lavaux.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.396
As exclusive as the McLaren itself,

24:42.189 --> 24:45.525
it promises to be one of
the most luxurious perfumes on the market.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.360
Please enjoy this wonderful night.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.779
I wonder who came up
with that brilliant idea.

24:49.863 --> 24:53.158
As long as he's happy
and you still have a job, I'm all good.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.009
[melancholy music playing]

25:18.975 --> 25:19.893
Thank you.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.150
[in French] Where's Erik?

25:27.234 --> 25:28.318
He left.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.406
Because of me?

25:36.076 --> 25:38.161
He wants to know why we're still married.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.374
And, honestly, I ask myself that too.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.128
[Laurent chuckles]

25:53.176 --> 25:54.386
Come for a walk with me?

26:02.727 --> 26:04.854
[Sylvie] We really need to do something.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.315
How do you want us to move forward in life

26:07.399 --> 26:09.401
if, on paper, we're still married?

26:11.278 --> 26:12.529
Do you want a divorce?

26:13.321 --> 26:14.406
Do you?

26:14.489 --> 26:15.490
Well, I…

26:17.576 --> 26:19.286
All I want is for you to be happy.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.788
Married or not,
doesn't change anything.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.039
I'm here for you.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.917
Anyway, I'm too busy with work.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.004
Hold on…

26:30.255 --> 26:32.882
Is that the only reason
we stay married, you and me?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.475
-[gasps]
-[bees buzzing]

26:42.559 --> 26:43.435
What?

26:43.518 --> 26:45.020
[shrieks]

26:46.021 --> 26:47.230
Bees!

26:47.314 --> 26:48.648
Run!

26:51.943 --> 26:54.195
They're in my dress!

26:54.279 --> 26:55.655
[Laurent] They're in my pants!

26:56.990 --> 26:58.825
Okay, okay, run, run!

27:03.913 --> 27:04.748
Where are we?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.556
[both panting]

27:24.142 --> 27:28.271
[both laughing]

27:34.986 --> 27:36.696
[sensual music playing]

27:52.545 --> 27:53.922
[moaning]

28:03.014 --> 28:05.600
[Sylvie and Laurent
chattering indistinctly]

28:11.564 --> 28:12.982
[Catherine clears throat]

28:15.777 --> 28:17.570
How's it going?
The room was comfortable?

28:17.654 --> 28:18.988
Wonderful.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.574
Thank you for having us.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.034
The pleasure is mine.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.121
-I'll put the suitcases in the car.
-Yes.

28:27.914 --> 28:30.041
I'm glad to see you happy, Sylvie.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.001
With whichever man you choose.

28:32.585 --> 28:33.837
As long as it's not my husband.

28:34.587 --> 28:35.672
Well, that makes two of us.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.978
[Alfie in English]
I'll call us a cab.

28:51.229 --> 28:52.856
[Catherine] Are you heading out?

28:52.939 --> 28:55.275
Thank you for coming through
for Maison Lavaux.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.401
I appreciate it.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.902
It was our pleasure.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.488
And Alfie, I'm so glad you're our new CFO.

29:00.572 --> 29:04.617
We desperately needed someone
willing to go toe to toe with Antoine

29:05.201 --> 29:07.287
and rein in his extravagant tendencies.

29:07.912 --> 29:11.249
Well, that's why we love him,
and I think he's coming around.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.420
Two of my favorite colleagues,
and my lovely wife.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.213
Emily.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.591
Thank you for the inspiration.

29:19.674 --> 29:23.428
Some of the McLaren team preordered
numbered bottles of Lavande de Lavaux.

29:23.511 --> 29:25.138
They want to promote it with the car.

29:25.221 --> 29:26.431
Oh, my God, yay!

29:26.514 --> 29:29.017
That's amazing,
it's not a complete loss.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.185
On the contrary.

29:30.727 --> 29:31.978
Now, darling…

29:32.061 --> 29:35.690
Don't be mad, but how can I produce
a purple scent without a purple car?

29:37.901 --> 29:38.735
She's my muse.

29:38.818 --> 29:40.487
[Catherine] Are you kidding me?

29:40.570 --> 29:43.948
I'm your muse, and we can't afford this.
Alfie, please.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.076
Antoine, we just nearly avoided a crisis.

29:47.577 --> 29:50.038
I mean, is this really necessary?

29:50.830 --> 29:53.750
Luxury is a necessity
that begins when necessity ends.

29:53.833 --> 29:55.668
Mmm. Coco Chanel.

29:56.294 --> 29:59.172
Exactly, and I think she knew
what she was talking about.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.969
Do you mind? I don't have time
to drive it back to Paris.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.597
Well, I mean, I'm sure I can…

30:08.097 --> 30:10.225
I'm sure I can find a way to write it off.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.810
I thought you might.

30:12.393 --> 30:13.770
I'll see you back at the office.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.150
This is not what I meant
by reining him in.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.445
Anyway, have a good trip back.

30:23.154 --> 30:23.988
Bye.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.033
-[Alfie laughs]
-Oh, boy.

30:30.495 --> 30:31.871
I always wanted to do that.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.164
[laughs]

30:33.248 --> 30:34.332
I meant to ask.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.543
How was the food at that Michelin place?

30:36.626 --> 30:38.628
[Emily] Oh. It was incredible.

30:38.711 --> 30:41.297
Everything we tasted
was the best I've ever had.

30:41.381 --> 30:42.382
Nice.

30:42.465 --> 30:43.758
Give us a receipt.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.093
And I'll put it through.

30:49.681 --> 30:50.723
Um…

30:52.392 --> 30:53.268
It's not here.

30:53.351 --> 30:54.477
Gabriel must have it.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.438
[Alfie] You're almost as bad as Antoine.

31:00.567 --> 31:01.901
Whoo!

31:01.985 --> 31:03.194
Come on, Cooper.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.195
Okay.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.365
Oh, yeah, she's in.

31:07.448 --> 31:08.783
Let's see how fast this can go.

31:11.828 --> 31:13.329
[engine revs]

31:14.289 --> 31:15.707
[upbeat music playing]

31:20.920 --> 31:22.213
Whoo!

31:25.592 --> 31:27.093
[screams]

31:27.176 --> 31:28.261
Oh, my God!

31:28.845 --> 31:30.930
[Emily screams and laughs]

31:43.067 --> 31:45.236
[theme music playing]
