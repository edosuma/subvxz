01:31.357 --> 01:32.483
No potty breaks.

01:32.959 --> 01:37.453
Dude, stop the truck.
You can leave us here. It"s fine.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.779
Hey, how far is the lake?

02:00.286 --> 02:01.253
About a mile east.

02:01.688 --> 02:04.350
Perfect, because I need a bath.

02:20.473 --> 02:24.534
Not that I don"t love this sexy,
impulsive thing, "cause I do.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.878
But what are the chances
we"re gonna get lost

02:27.981 --> 02:31.781
and, you know, we"re gonna die horribly?

02:32.919 --> 02:36.946
Look, you keep talking like that
and you"re gonna start lactating.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.006
Wow. It"s so beautiful here.

03:01.147 --> 03:02.774
And real scary, huh?

03:03.550 --> 03:04.539
Okay, fine.

03:05.084 --> 03:06.779
Make fun of me.

03:06.886 --> 03:11.516
But when a Wolverine comes out
and mauls you, you"re gonna be sorry.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.084
And you"re naked.

03:14.694 --> 03:15.991
You noticed.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.556
God.

03:29.442 --> 03:30.875
What are you laughing at, pal?
I meant to do that.

03:35.248 --> 03:36.510
Come on.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.607
-You laughing at me?
-Yeah.

03:39.185 --> 03:40.709
Are you? I see.

03:44.424 --> 03:45.448
Hey, what"s that?

03:45.925 --> 03:48.450
Come on, the water"s cold. It shrinks a bit.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.757
What? I don"t hear anything.

03:55.802 --> 03:59.238
-Hey, come on. I got an idea.
-Cool.

04:14.821 --> 04:16.083
God, something bit me.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.286
Yeah, right. Perhaps Wolverine.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.390
I"ve never heard you be so verbal.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.835
Take it easy, cowboy.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.736
Now, you see,
that"s what l"ve been talking about.

04:39.646 --> 04:40.670
Help!

04:43.049 --> 04:44.038
Help!

04:48.087 --> 04:49.076
Oh, my God!

05:33.833 --> 05:36.233
Hey, big guy. You wanna come inside?

05:36.502 --> 05:37.560
Your mom needs some help.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.296
-Sure, Dad.
-Okay.

05:52.151 --> 05:53.277
Sadie!

06:17.310 --> 06:20.973
No cell phone reception.
It"s like we"ve gone back in time.

06:22.281 --> 06:25.876
How can this place smell of cookies
and foot cream simultaneously?

06:26.519 --> 06:28.953
Well, they were
two of Aunt Sadie"s favorite things.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.079
That and dropping F-bombs.

06:32.325 --> 06:35.021
I am not gonna miss that at Thanksgiving.

06:35.128 --> 06:38.097
-Didn"t she always blame it on the dog?
-Yeah.

06:39.298 --> 06:44.565
You know, as both your wife
and your real estate agent,

06:45.738 --> 06:50.607
I can pretty much say with confidence
that most of this crap has gotta go.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.075
It"s gonna be a huge job.

06:56.182 --> 06:59.481
Yeah, but we can"t bring it all back
to the house.

07:02.121 --> 07:03.452
She was eccentric.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.384
Really?

07:05.958 --> 07:08.893
Yeah, a different word
popped into my mind.

07:12.365 --> 07:15.596
You know, everything"s almost exactly
how I remember it.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.669
I mean, I never thought that...

07:18.037 --> 07:20.369
Well, I never thought
that we"d be cleaning out her cabin, so...

07:22.708 --> 07:25.802
I feel like l"m selling part of my childhood
with this place.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.972
I know, honey. But it"s best we stay in town.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.774
-Can I have that?
-No.

07:35.755 --> 07:36.847
-Yeah, sure.
-No.

07:36.989 --> 07:37.956
-Yeah.
-Yes.

07:44.564 --> 07:48.864
I have a pop quiz for you,
Mr. EPA Scientist. Okay?

07:49.435 --> 07:53.531
So what kind of animal
lives in a tank like that one?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.540
The smart money"s on that lizard right there.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.940
-What?
-ls there nothing there?

07:59.045 --> 08:00.512
Well, that was probably my mistake,
I thought it was...

08:00.947 --> 08:02.209
Funny!

08:02.315 --> 08:04.044
Freak out the city girl.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.812
Just "cause I don"t share
the Bickerman infatuation with...

08:06.919 --> 08:09.615
What? Life? Nature?

08:09.722 --> 08:12.520
Nature to you. Disgusting creatures to me.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.759
All right, well, heads up for both of you,

08:14.861 --> 08:17.489
there might be an escaped lizard
somewhere in the house.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.224
Can we keep it?

08:19.332 --> 08:22.768
Absolutely not. No.
Besides, you already have a pet.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.200
Crocodiles aren"t pets.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.395
Well, they are to some people, pal.

08:25.671 --> 08:26.695
Not if they"re stuffed.

08:26.839 --> 08:27.863
You know what?

08:28.274 --> 08:33.006
If we find any kind of vermin in the house,
your dad is gonna take care of it.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.005
Dad?

08:36.115 --> 08:39.414
In a completely humane way, of course.

08:39.751 --> 08:40.878
Sure. Sit down.

09:01.874 --> 09:05.037
-Mr. Bickerman?
-Hey, Nate. Nathan. Come on in.

09:09.849 --> 09:10.873
Sheriff Willinger.

09:10.983 --> 09:12.575
-Hey. Susan.
-Hey.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.312
It"s been a while.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.613
Almost a year since Sadie passed.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.984
I was going by, I saw your vehicle.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.258
I thought l"d drop in and say hey.

09:20.359 --> 09:21.451
-Yeah, of course.
-Yeah.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.419
Takes after Sadie, huh?

09:24.931 --> 09:27.991
Connor, could you give us a minute, please?

09:28.267 --> 09:29.666
-Okay.
-Thanks.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.768
Yeah, we haven"t told him, so...

09:37.343 --> 09:38.332
I don"t blame you.

09:38.444 --> 09:41.004
A boy his age, that would raise questions
you don"t have answers to.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.708
Hell, l"d like to know what your aunt
was doing feeding wild crocs.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.811
Well, she was lonely.

09:48.821 --> 09:50.413
I mean, I know we live in town.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.616
We don"t get out here that much. And with...

09:52.725 --> 09:54.556
You know, ever since Connor was born,
and our jobs, it"s...

09:54.660 --> 09:55.718
Well, there"s never enough time.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.356
And now the place is for sale.

10:00.299 --> 10:04.235
It took a year for us to drive out here
to clean up Sadie"s stuff. It"s...

10:04.337 --> 10:07.500
You know, believe me,
this isn"t easy for me. We...

10:07.607 --> 10:10.269
If we had a choice,
we probably wouldn"t even sell it.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.436
Yeah, but it"s not like we can come out here
and have a picnic

10:13.546 --> 10:14.672
and forget about what happened.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.442
I don"t even like bringing Connor here
for a few hours.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.080
Well, that"s understandable.

10:20.186 --> 10:24.179
I"d like you to know
that l"ve been all over that lake.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.350
Back to front, top to bottom,
had a sonar rig brought in.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.021
I can tell you, ma"am, there ain"t nothing
swimming in that lake bigger than a trout.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.995
Yeah, but you can never be sure.

10:33.099 --> 10:37.399
-Right?
-Ma"am, when my predecessor left the job,

10:37.503 --> 10:39.494
-the county wanted to hire somebody...
-Hey, where are you going?

10:39.605 --> 10:41.232
...who could guarantee
that what happened here

10:41.340 --> 10:42.932
didn"t happen again, and that"s me.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.407
Now, you"re gonna have to trust me.

10:45.344 --> 10:48.404
You know? I"ve seen things that are
a lot worse than what happened here.

10:48.514 --> 10:52.644
Hell, I had a 6"5"" cross-dresser
come at me with a machete.

10:56.255 --> 10:58.086
What l"m trying to say is,

10:58.991 --> 11:02.552
in this world it"s the people
you gotta worry about, not the animals.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.625
-l"m gonna be on my way, here.
-Sure, sure.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.754
Thank you for coming by.

11:07.266 --> 11:08.893
You take care, now.

11:29.955 --> 11:33.652
All l"m saying is that if the lake is cleared,
there"s no reason to sell.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.853
Nathan, we didn"t even come here
when Sadie was alive.

11:36.962 --> 11:40.693
I know. But, I mean, no one knows better
than you how bad the market is right now.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.995
I"m just saying, why don"t we wait?

11:43.102 --> 11:45.468
You know, test it out. We could... Please?

11:47.573 --> 11:50.974
You know what? Fine. Okay.
We can wait until the market recovers.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.841
-But Connor is not swimming in that lake.
-Done.

11:53.946 --> 11:54.913
But he"s not gonna make any friends

11:55.014 --> 11:57.278
if we keep dragging him off
to the middle of nowhere.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.440
Well...

11:58.651 --> 11:59.811
Connor?

12:01.687 --> 12:03.848
-Where"d he go?
-I don"t know.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.094
Come here, little guy.
I"m not gonna hurt you.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.953
Looks like I got a pet after all. Lots of them.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.157
Connor! Don"t run off
without telling us, okay?

12:49.268 --> 12:50.826
-Sorry.
-Come on.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.961
We"re driving back to town.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.688
It"s 6:.00 a.m. and you"re not on the trail.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.988
-You going soft on me?
-Yeah.

13:16.095 --> 13:18.563
-I thought you had a big day.
-I do.

13:19.832 --> 13:22.528
Don"t I at least get a ""good morning""?

13:22.668 --> 13:25.262
Sorry. We lost another one.

13:26.672 --> 13:29.072
The signal from the elk"s radio collar
went and became erratic,

13:29.175 --> 13:32.201
and then we lost it completely
yesterday afternoon, so...

13:32.311 --> 13:33.903
This one is gonna be the last one.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.140
Meaning you know
what"s been happening to them?

13:36.248 --> 13:37.340
I think it"s a poacher.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.984
I think they"re bringing hunters
onto state land. I think it"s a business.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.212
And...

13:45.424 --> 13:47.790
I hope you find your bad guy.

13:49.795 --> 13:50.819
Good morning.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.798
And don"t forget to say goodbye
to your zoologist-in-training.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.767
Right. Right. Hey, is Vica coming by today?

13:58.871 --> 14:00.600
She has to take her dog to the vet.

14:00.706 --> 14:02.833
Something about
it having another panic attack,

14:02.942 --> 14:06.708
but I promised Connor
I would spend the day with him anyway, so...

14:06.812 --> 14:09.337
Hey, Connor, l"m heading out the door.

14:09.448 --> 14:12.781
You wanna say goodbye to me
before I leave? Love you.

14:13.552 --> 14:17.454
-Goodbye? When did you get back?
-Late last night. Something came up at work

14:17.590 --> 14:20.787
and I will tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

14:20.893 --> 14:23.293
-But, Dad...
-Hey, I got to go, okay?

14:25.397 --> 14:26.421
Bye.

15:00.266 --> 15:04.362
God! Mother of...
Next year, you are going to summer school.

15:05.371 --> 15:09.239
You"ve been on there all morning.
When are you gonna be done?

15:09.341 --> 15:12.037
Soon, honey. There are a lot of cabins
that need renting

15:12.144 --> 15:14.908
and I have so many people counting on me.

15:18.183 --> 15:20.549
Two hours, tops, okay? I promise.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.954
Honey, why don"t you just go play outside?

15:28.394 --> 15:29.554
Connor?

15:45.577 --> 15:46.635
Hey, guys.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.643
Hey, guys.
Do you wanna see something cool?

15:50.582 --> 15:53.415
""Hey, guys. Wanna see something cool?""

15:56.789 --> 15:59.758
-What a freaking jester.
-What a dork.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.537
Feeding time.

16:41.633 --> 16:42.691
That"s all I got.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.671
Hey, no eating the cook.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.035
I"ll try to bring more next time.

17:09.294 --> 17:10.659
Where is it?

17:11.463 --> 17:14.329
Around back. Tried to take a chunk
out of one of my customers.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.367
It"s wicked big.

17:22.074 --> 17:23.905
I think he came up through the toilet.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.884
You"re wasting my time.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.188
Take it easy, Tony.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.388
Willinger.

17:44.463 --> 17:45.760
Yes, dear.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.765
Yes, dear. Yeah. Yeah.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.401
Here, could you hold on? Hold on, dear.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.004
Willinger.

17:57.342 --> 17:58.934
I got a lead on my missing elk.

17:59.044 --> 18:01.308
Seems she"s wandering around
somewhere near Sadie"s lake.

18:01.713 --> 18:04.147
Nathan, I don"t wanna hear anything
about crocodiles.

18:04.249 --> 18:08.185
There"s nothing in that lake
bigger than a trout. Just stay put.

18:11.056 --> 18:12.853
That was productive.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.356
Yes, dear.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.161
Well, you shouldn"t have put it
in the microwave.

18:42.521 --> 18:43.988
I Wish I could believe you.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.122
It Was a one-night stand, Marsha.
She meant nothing to me.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.023
-I have absolutely no feelings for her.
-ut this is hoW...

18:49.128 --> 18:51.926
He was kissing Jessica
before the last commercial.

18:52.030 --> 18:55.830
...SusanBs little one? The little one
With the same hair and eyes as yours.

18:56.101 --> 18:59.366
Susan? Susan means
absolutely nothing to me.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.572
Where"s my mom?

19:01.673 --> 19:03.140
Connor, where have you been?

19:03.242 --> 19:04.334
Forgot my phone.

19:05.477 --> 19:06.910
Where are you going?

19:07.012 --> 19:10.971
Honey, I am so sorry, but I have a thing.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.982
What was I saying?

19:16.088 --> 19:17.749
I have a last minute open house.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.315
So I am gonna leave you with Vica
for the rest of the day

19:21.426 --> 19:23.792
and tomorrow we will go see a movie.
I promise.

19:23.896 --> 19:24.863
But you said that we"d...

19:24.963 --> 19:26.828
Connor, this is important.
Please understand.

19:26.965 --> 19:28.592
But I need to show you something.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.025
Well, show me when I get home,

19:31.069 --> 19:32.627
I love you so much.

19:32.738 --> 19:33.762
Bye.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.389
Connor! What are you doing?

19:56.061 --> 19:59.724
You smell like dead goat. Go take bath.

20:00.299 --> 20:04.497
I"m going to the store
to get some baseball cards.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.765
I don"t care about your baseball cards.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.110
Connor! You didn"t take bath.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.273
You got to stay away
from those cookies, boy.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.579
You seem to have gained
quite a bit of weight since I last saw you.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.154
About two minutes ago.

21:32.391 --> 21:33.517
Well, l...

21:34.493 --> 21:36.927
If it were me, l"d kick your little butt.

21:38.096 --> 21:41.224
Parents" number.
And not the fake one, either.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.398
Gotta be out here somewhere.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.203
God!

21:57.316 --> 21:58.578
Sorry. Sorry.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.580
Thanks. I think you knocked out a filling.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.383
Well, I know the name of a good dentist
in town, if you need one.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.822
Thanks for the tip.
Maybe we can call it with your space phone.

22:09.227 --> 22:12.958
Space phone? Yeah, good one.
No, it"s a radar antenna. Are you okay?

22:13.765 --> 22:14.993
Yeah, l"ll let you know.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.194
I"m a zoologist.
I"m doing a project for the EPA on elk, so.

22:19.604 --> 22:23.165
Elk? Like deer with big antlers?

22:23.742 --> 22:25.767
Yeah, but don"t tell the deer that.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.753
-Seriously, Connor? Stealing meat?
-No, l...

22:40.559 --> 22:45.428
Mr. Dimitri, I am so sorry.
He"s never done anything like this before.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.024
Really?

22:48.867 --> 22:53.327
Yeah, he just loves meat.
Ever since he was wee high...

22:53.739 --> 22:54.831
Well, goody-goody for him.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.302
All he has to do now is pay for it.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.207
Nobody wants to buy used meat.

23:00.545 --> 23:01.569
No, of course.

23:01.847 --> 23:03.144
-lt"s not for me, it"s for...
-Connor,

23:04.015 --> 23:05.846
I want you to go straight home
and wait for me in your room.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.484
-But, Mom...
-Now.

23:13.558 --> 23:17.688
Look, I promise this will never happen again.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.457
He"s a good kid, really. He"s just...

23:22.000 --> 23:23.058
He"s a little bored,

23:23.869 --> 23:25.803
and that is my fault, not his.

23:27.205 --> 23:30.003
So, how much do I owe you?

23:30.976 --> 23:34.571
Just to let you know,
the chicken went off sale yesterday.

23:35.213 --> 23:38.114
So, are they usually like that?

23:38.950 --> 23:41.942
Well, unless there"s a species
of flying-elk-head I haven"t heard of,

23:42.053 --> 23:43.884
I"m gonna go out on a limb and say no.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.017
Sorry. Excuse me.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.290
-Hello.
-Hey.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.225
I just got pulled away
from one of the biggest commissions

23:56.568 --> 24:00.163
of my life to bail your son from DimitriBs,

24:00.272 --> 24:02.866
where he was being held for shoplifting.

24:03.708 --> 24:09.943
Shoplifting? Okay, tell Dimitri
we"ll pay for whatever candy bar he stole.

24:10.048 --> 24:13.575
I paid for it, honey, but it wasn"t candy.

24:14.686 --> 24:16.950
No, he had a backpack full of meat.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.680
He"s stealing meat?

24:18.990 --> 24:23.723
Yeah. And apparently,
he"s taken up smoking.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.420
Smoking?

24:26.665 --> 24:29.395
So, remind me to put a lock
on the wine cabinet.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.763
He said theyBre VicaBs
but she doesnBt even smoke.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.734
And speaking of Vica,

24:34.840 --> 24:37.172
why are we paying her to sit at home
and watch TV

24:37.275 --> 24:39.175
whilst Connor is out shoplifting?

24:39.277 --> 24:41.507
Well, at least we"re keeping one of them
off the street.

24:42.514 --> 24:45.950
Did we not feed Connor the right things
as a baby?

24:46.051 --> 24:48.815
Did I eat too much chili
when he was in my womb,

24:48.920 --> 24:50.785
and now he"s a sociopath?

24:50.889 --> 24:52.880
What? He"s not a sociopath.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.618
I mean, every kid does something like this
at some point.

24:54.726 --> 24:56.216
He"s just... He"s being a little boy.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.455
A little boy who"s been unsupervised.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.795
Okay, put him on the phone,
I wanna talk to him.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.291
I sent him home.

25:04.069 --> 25:08.062
Sorry about your day. For what it"s worth,
mine isn"t going much better.

25:08.206 --> 25:13.439
Really? Sorry.
Okay, well, l"ll see you at home.

25:13.545 --> 25:15.035
Okay. Bye, babe.

25:15.146 --> 25:19.378
Yeah. And I just hope you don"t become
a vegetarian any time soon.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.117
I"m voting for pork chops.

25:21.820 --> 25:22.844
Bye.

25:28.426 --> 25:31.987
Sorry about that. Cell reception out here
is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so...

25:32.097 --> 25:34.691
Hey, what could have eaten the body?
A bear?

25:35.000 --> 25:37.298
I told you, I saw cougar tracks over there.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.936
He wasn"t asking you, Charlie.
He was asking the zookeeper.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.062
Zoologist.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.466
-lsn"t that what I said?
-No.

25:44.242 --> 25:47.678
I don"t think it was a bear,
but it may have been a cougar.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.574
What did I say?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.508
A cougar named Reba.

25:54.986 --> 25:57.216
-You know what you did?
-Yeah.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.898
Excuse me, sugar, could you pick that up?

26:14.773 --> 26:16.798
Thank you, handsome. You can keep it.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.378
Why would a hunter chop off the head?

26:25.483 --> 26:27.348
Yeah, isn"t the head
supposed to be the best part?

26:27.886 --> 26:32.619
Well, that"s what I keep trying to tell you,
but you don"t wanna go for it.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.893
Well, it doesn"t make rational sense, no.
But that might be the point.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.054
She might be trying to mess with me.

26:40.131 --> 26:41.223
Hunters are weird.

26:41.900 --> 26:42.958
Yes.

26:43.201 --> 26:46.568
So if it wasn"t this cougar lady,
then what was it?

26:47.138 --> 26:48.571
I don"t know.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.031
Look, if you guys run into any trouble,

26:51.142 --> 26:53.167
there"s a cabin
just on the other side of that point.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.974
You can duck in there if you"d like, okay?

26:56.081 --> 26:57.742
Yeah, what kind of trouble?

26:58.083 --> 27:01.075
Just be safe and don"t mess with the elk.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.413
All right? Sorry.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.320
-I hope you find your moose killer.
-Elk!

27:08.860 --> 27:09.918
Whatever.

27:10.228 --> 27:13.288
Excuse me,
is there a Reba around here anywhere?

27:14.099 --> 27:15.794
Just there? Thanks.

27:17.836 --> 27:18.860
Excuse me.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.636
-You Reba?
-Depends on who"s asking.

27:22.173 --> 27:23.401
I contacted you, l"m Brett.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.739
Then that would make me Reba. Have a seat.

27:33.952 --> 27:39.390
Now, if I may say so, that photo in your ad,
it just don"t do you no justice, Reba.

27:40.525 --> 27:42.390
Now, my good buddy Walt here and myself,

27:43.395 --> 27:46.762
we thought we were just getting ourselves
a hunting guide,

27:46.865 --> 27:50.824
but, girl, you are one fine package.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.797
Well, aren"t you just such a sweet talker.

27:59.611 --> 28:04.241
Once we"re miles away from civilization,
been out there a few days,

28:04.349 --> 28:08.080
missed everything you shot at,
and your belly starts grumbling,

28:08.186 --> 28:13.385
you"re gonna appreciate my aim
a lot more than my other assets.

28:13.725 --> 28:14.987
If you receive my meaning.

28:16.394 --> 28:20.592
Well, l, for one, am a multi-tasker
and I plan on appreciating both.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.660
So,

28:27.238 --> 28:30.264
Brett, was it? How"d you hear about Reba?

28:31.843 --> 28:32.867
Internet.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.140
Internet.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.313
How about you two load your gear
into my truck?

28:40.418 --> 28:42.511
It"s the big one out front.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.111
Boat on the back, gun rack up front,

28:45.857 --> 28:49.884
mildly offensive bumper-sticker. You"ll see.

28:50.095 --> 28:52.393
All right. Let"s go, Walt.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.553
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.066
All right. There.

29:00.371 --> 29:01.497
Thank you.

29:05.677 --> 29:07.042
So, Brett?

29:08.980 --> 29:11.448
You play your cards pretty close to the vest,

29:13.685 --> 29:16.119
but I think I deserve to know
what you"re really doing here.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.377
Your website said that...

29:18.923 --> 29:20.754
I don"t have a website.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.358
Well, let"s just say you"re kind of a legend.

29:31.236 --> 29:32.464
A legend?

29:33.371 --> 29:34.804
Of what sort?

29:34.906 --> 29:37.397
Bigfoot? Crop circles?

29:38.143 --> 29:39.167
Global warming?

29:39.277 --> 29:43.077
No. You know how to find things
that don"t wanna be found.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.740
I"m looking for a girl.

29:47.952 --> 29:50.182
A girl that hangs out in the woods?

29:50.889 --> 29:53.119
Or the lake. I"m not really sure.

29:56.027 --> 29:58.587
All right, look. I don"t have a chance
of finding her on my own,

29:58.696 --> 30:00.664
and you"re the only guide
that goes into the area.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.625
All right, then.

30:06.838 --> 30:11.969
Elks for the yahoos.
One Lois Lane for Superman here.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.049
Where is it?

30:40.138 --> 30:41.298
The meat stealer.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.069
Your mother called. Go to room.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.574
-Lost something? Like a lighter?
-Give it back.

30:48.479 --> 30:49.776
You tried to get me in trouble

30:49.881 --> 30:51.940
by putting this and the cigarettes
in my backpack.

30:52.317 --> 30:53.579
Give it back right now.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.380
And you can ask my mom
for the cigarettes.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.051
Teddy? Teddy?

31:26.117 --> 31:30.315
Connor! Come back here.
Your mother will be mad at me.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.270
Devil child, where did you go?

32:26.277 --> 32:30.338
Okay, so l"m down to one hotdog.
You guys are gonna have to share.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.413
Connor!

32:41.025 --> 32:42.390
It was here.

32:47.565 --> 32:51.331
Nathan, I am sick and tired
of these false alarms and pranks.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.131
Now, I drove all the way out here
because you promised me a bloody mess.

32:55.239 --> 32:58.436
-Now, where is it?
-lt was right here.

33:03.181 --> 33:04.808
Teddy, stay.

33:05.249 --> 33:06.841
Come on, Teddy, get away from there.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.280
Wait.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.294
Teddy, no.

33:20.999 --> 33:21.988
Watch yourself.

33:24.635 --> 33:26.899
Teddy, no! Come back, Teddy. No.

33:41.786 --> 33:42.878
It"s a stick.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.312
Yeah.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.553
Poor Teddy,
now I know why you have a panic attack.

34:00.905 --> 34:03.237
-How many elk did you say you"ve lost?
-ln the last six months?

34:03.441 --> 34:04.430
Yeah.

34:05.009 --> 34:07.341
Too many.
I"m starting to think it"s not a poacher.

34:08.312 --> 34:12.179
Hey, I checked that lake three times.

34:12.550 --> 34:16.077
And, Nathan, I swear to God
my eyes were open the whole time.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.815
Now look, I may be from the city,
but I know my way around the wilderness.

34:19.290 --> 34:23.021
Last time you checked that lake was a year
and a half ago, and things change.

34:23.127 --> 34:25.721
Now, we owe it to the community
to make sure that lake is clear.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.663
I don"t live with my head in the sand.
I need evidence.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.427
Well, what if something just came
and ate it?

34:31.002 --> 34:33.766
And what if the evidence is a stick?

34:34.806 --> 34:37.536
I don"t have sophisticated sonar equipment.

34:37.675 --> 34:40.235
We"d have to order it in.
That would take days.

34:42.112 --> 34:43.137
Okay.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.751
But we do have the next best thing
back at the station.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.552
Well, great.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.687
So you and l, we"ll go back,
we"ll come here, we"ll check the lake.

34:53.791 --> 34:56.282
Now, nothing would make me happier
than for you to be right.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.623
All right. All right, let"s go fishing.

35:24.989 --> 35:26.286
Yes, dear.

35:26.991 --> 35:29.482
Yes, dear. Why don"t you do that?

35:32.463 --> 35:34.761
I bought this with my own money.

35:35.433 --> 35:38.698
You know, in New York City we got people
who swear they"ve seen Elvis

35:38.803 --> 35:40.703
at 63rd and Park.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.467
We got people
who swear they"ve been abducted by aliens

35:43.574 --> 35:47.635
and, yes, we"ve even got people
who swear they"ve seen albino crocodiles

35:48.012 --> 35:49.309
-in the subway.
-Sheriff!

35:49.413 --> 35:50.471
Shut up!

36:02.627 --> 36:06.688
Wow! That"s a little much
for Aroostook County, don"t you think?

36:07.265 --> 36:12.259
I believe a boy scout
should always be prepared.

36:13.704 --> 36:15.365
Especially one from Jersey.

36:15.473 --> 36:16.633
Connor?

36:23.548 --> 36:24.606
Vica?

36:28.019 --> 36:29.179
Connor!

36:47.805 --> 36:51.536
I think the sun is better over here.

37:25.076 --> 37:28.136
Connor? Connor, are you here?

37:29.981 --> 37:32.677
You know, I told you to go straight home.

37:33.217 --> 37:34.377
Connor!

37:36.320 --> 37:37.309
Mom,

37:38.422 --> 37:39.753
I think I did something bad.

37:39.857 --> 37:42.223
-Sweetie, is that blood?
-No, no, no.

37:42.326 --> 37:44.521
-What is...
-lt"s not my blood. It"s...

37:45.463 --> 37:46.589
I was by the lake...

37:58.943 --> 38:01.639
In the water. He"s in the water!

38:17.395 --> 38:18.384
You coming, Ellie?

38:19.063 --> 38:20.087
Isn"t it a little cold?

38:21.299 --> 38:22.630
That"s why we came out here.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.802
Get out into the real world,
the way things used to be.

38:26.470 --> 38:29.337
You know, when our ancestors came here,
there were no heated pools.

38:29.907 --> 38:32.603
There didn"t have iPods either,
but I noticed you brought yours.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.308
Hey, at least you got away
from he-who-must-not-be-named.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.040
Yeah, let"s not talk about it, okay?

38:37.448 --> 38:40.144
I bought a new bikini for this trip,
so I have to use it,

38:40.251 --> 38:42.014
whether the water is freezing or not.

38:43.020 --> 38:44.078
See, now she"s got the right idea.

38:45.723 --> 38:47.884
Or, I have a better idea.

38:48.459 --> 38:50.518
Why don"t we all just jump in naked?

38:50.628 --> 38:52.687
That"d be hilarious, right?

38:53.864 --> 38:55.195
You guys first.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.304
It worked!

39:01.072 --> 39:03.632
Yeah, I guess the image of you naked
really did the trick.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.488
He actually thought
we were gonna jump in there naked.

39:18.589 --> 39:19.886
I know. He is so...

39:19.990 --> 39:21.981
-Obnoxious, right?
-I was gonna say funny.

39:22.827 --> 39:23.851
You"re kidding.

39:23.961 --> 39:26.156
Not like ""l"m gonna sleep with him"" funny,

39:26.263 --> 39:28.857
but like, ""l"d set him up
with one of my fat friends"" funny.

39:28.999 --> 39:31.297
Like you have any fat friends.

39:31.402 --> 39:33.893
-Clarissa put on a ton of weight recently.
-Tara!

39:34.271 --> 39:37.297
-What?
-She"s pregnant, not fat.

39:37.742 --> 39:41.735
It"s not all baby. She"s not giving birth
to, like, Andre the freaking Giant.

39:41.912 --> 39:43.174
You"re terrible.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.941
Just being realistic.

39:48.619 --> 39:49.950
That"s a really cute bikini.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.351
-Where"d you get that?
-Thanks. Clarissa"s closet.

39:51.689 --> 39:52.986
Have you heard from Brett?

39:53.090 --> 39:55.115
No, if I wanted to talk to Brett,
I would have called him, so...

39:55.559 --> 39:57.254
Well, you"re not gonna let him apologize?

39:57.361 --> 40:00.228
I"m gonna let him stew for a few days,
or weeks. I haven"t decided.

40:00.698 --> 40:01.722
Would you?

40:02.166 --> 40:03.360
Does he know about you and Aaron?

40:03.567 --> 40:04.591
What?

40:04.702 --> 40:06.795
No, there"s nothing to know.

40:06.904 --> 40:10.340
Yeah, and l"m not gonna hook up
with the lacrosse team.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.606
-Seriously, there"s nothing.
-Yeah, right.

40:12.977 --> 40:14.001
Honest.

40:15.012 --> 40:16.036
You ready?

40:16.147 --> 40:18.638
-Yeah, let"s go.
-lt"s gonna be cold.

40:32.863 --> 40:34.296
Oh, God.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.336
Oh, my God!

40:54.785 --> 40:56.548
It"s good though, eh?

41:08.999 --> 41:12.298
-What"s going on?
-I can"t get through to my wife.

41:12.536 --> 41:15.630
I haven"t been able to get through to mine
since "86.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.606
Connor, try 911 again.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.243
It won"t go through.

41:26.283 --> 41:27.580
Vica? Vica? Hold still, honey.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.514
This is gonna hurt even worse.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.856
Connor, find me something
to soak up the blood. Now, now, now.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.485
Well, Susan isn"t gonna believe this.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.093
I mean, ""What did you do today?""

41:43.067 --> 41:44.625
""l hunted a crocodile.""

41:46.370 --> 41:47.564
You"re all worked up over this, aren"t you?

41:48.105 --> 41:49.129
Yeah.

41:51.575 --> 41:53.543
Okay. Here.

41:57.147 --> 41:58.205
I"m sorry.

41:59.350 --> 42:03.411
Okay. Connor, start talking.

42:04.121 --> 42:05.611
I just wanted a pet.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.050
Sweetie, what was it?

42:13.430 --> 42:14.488
Mom!

42:21.272 --> 42:22.261
Hey, Suze, guess what?

42:22.573 --> 42:23.631
Vica...

42:23.741 --> 42:25.333
-You there?
-We donBt knoW What...

42:26.010 --> 42:27.170
-Can you hear me?
-Okay, Susan,

42:27.645 --> 42:29.203
try to speak a little more slowly

42:29.313 --> 42:30.678
-and calm down.
-...at the cabin.

42:30.915 --> 42:32.576
She"s at the cabin. She"s terrified.

42:32.683 --> 42:35.652
-And... And I donBt knoW What...
-Okay. Hey...

42:38.022 --> 42:39.614
Come on. Let"s load the guns.

42:48.532 --> 42:51.126
It"s not that I didn"t wanna let
the poor bastard live,

42:51.235 --> 42:55.001
it"s just, how many times do you get
to shoot a giraffe?

42:56.507 --> 42:58.270
-Hey.
-Anyway, the zoo

42:58.776 --> 43:02.906
demoted me to the souvenir shop after that.
Can you imagine?

43:04.114 --> 43:05.411
You"re joking, right?

43:06.083 --> 43:07.846
You shot an animal in captivity?

43:07.952 --> 43:10.750
Just further proving
that my philosophy is correct.

43:11.488 --> 43:15.754
Hunting"s not fair,
so there"s no point in pretending otherwise.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.863
What"s that?

43:20.965 --> 43:25.868
This is what guarantees you a shot
at the big game.

43:27.838 --> 43:30.534
Big game is what you"re after. Right, Brett?

43:32.676 --> 43:35.509
Nothing like shooting and eating an animal
you"re not supposed to.

43:38.048 --> 43:39.538
Stop the boat.

43:39.917 --> 43:42.647
I usually don"t take orders,
but l"ll let that one slide.

43:43.587 --> 43:45.179
What"d you see, college boy, a turtle?

43:45.422 --> 43:46.446
Quiet.

43:46.590 --> 43:51.550
Okay, that one l"m not gonna let slide.
That"s gonna cost you an extra 20.

44:05.075 --> 44:07.407
What did you see?
Did you see Vica get bitten?

44:07.511 --> 44:08.910
-No.
-Then whose blood is this?

44:10.381 --> 44:11.439
Teddy"s.

44:12.282 --> 44:13.340
He went too close to the water

44:13.450 --> 44:16.715
and I tried calling him
and he wouldn"t listen.

44:20.524 --> 44:21.548
Mom?

44:22.359 --> 44:23.417
Yeah?

44:24.094 --> 44:25.254
I fed them.

44:26.530 --> 44:27.519
What?

44:29.500 --> 44:31.127
The meat from our freezer.

44:31.235 --> 44:34.602
And that"s why I stole from the store,
because I couldn"t feed them enough.

44:35.606 --> 44:37.870
That"s why they ate Vica"s dog.

44:38.108 --> 44:39.132
Connor,

44:41.011 --> 44:42.876
you"ve been coming here,
when we told you not to?

44:43.414 --> 44:44.506
On my bike.

44:45.249 --> 44:46.910
You knew there were dangerous animals
in the lake

44:47.017 --> 44:49.349
-and you didn"t tell us?
-You would have made Dad kill them.

44:50.621 --> 44:54.113
Oh, my God. No, no, sweetie, he would...
He would never have done that.

44:54.224 --> 44:55.714
He would have moved them

44:55.826 --> 44:58.090
and taken them someplace safe.

45:01.665 --> 45:02.654
Is she going to be okay?

45:04.935 --> 45:07.233
I don"t know, sweetie. I...

45:08.605 --> 45:11.005
Try the phone again, please.

45:15.579 --> 45:19.071
Okay. Okay, Connor,

45:21.151 --> 45:22.618
we have to get Vica into the car

45:23.454 --> 45:25.388
and get her to the hospital. Okay?

45:26.256 --> 45:28.156
Yeah, but what if they come back?

45:42.673 --> 45:45.733
Doesn"t all this take
some of the fun out of it?

45:49.046 --> 45:51.207
You know what? You"re right.

45:52.116 --> 45:53.549
I think that actually,

45:53.650 --> 45:57.347
we should track their footprints
and sniff the ground

45:57.454 --> 46:00.048
to see where they mark their territory.

46:02.559 --> 46:04.322
All right, guys, close enough.

46:04.428 --> 46:07.022
We"ll let your predator instincts
take over from here, okay?

46:07.131 --> 46:08.428
-Yep.
-All right.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.532
This is the fun part.

46:31.288 --> 46:34.018
Walt! Walt! Walt!

46:58.148 --> 47:01.311
No. No. Get off of me.

47:03.987 --> 47:05.921
-Hurry up.
-There"s a crocodile.

47:06.023 --> 47:07.854
-Walt!
-Come on, get her here.

47:12.930 --> 47:16.422
No. Get off of me. Get off of me. Walt!

47:16.533 --> 47:18.000
No, don"t be an idiot.

47:19.069 --> 47:20.297
Now get off!

47:23.407 --> 47:28.344
Damn it. That ain"t right.
That ain"t anything close to right.

47:28.445 --> 47:30.106
We need to get the hell out of here.

47:30.214 --> 47:32.478
Yeah? To where?

47:32.583 --> 47:33.948
Hey, you"re the guide, you tell me.

47:42.059 --> 47:44.721
-No. No. We can"t just leave Walt.
-Of course we can.

47:45.796 --> 47:47.787
Something just ripped him
to pieces back there.

47:47.898 --> 47:51.527
But I know, let"s all get back in the water.
You grab an arm, you grab a leg

47:51.635 --> 47:54.069
-and l"ll just bring up the rear.
-Shut up.

47:54.771 --> 47:55.738
Shut up?

47:57.341 --> 47:59.536
-Shut up? Shut up?
-Just calm down. Relax.

47:59.643 --> 48:00.803
-Come on.
-You shut up!

48:00.911 --> 48:02.105
Hey!

48:09.219 --> 48:10.208
Charlie?

48:10.621 --> 48:14.990
Hey, man, Tara needs you.
Somebody needs to check her for ticks.

48:21.665 --> 48:24.133
Okay, Charlie. Enough"s enough.

48:24.601 --> 48:27.001
This isn"t funny anymore.
Get your ass back here.

48:27.104 --> 48:29.470
God. Which direction did he go?

48:30.407 --> 48:33.774
Knowing Charlie, he"s probably finding
a quiet spot to whack off.

48:34.444 --> 48:37.072
Why did we have to bring him?
He gives me the creeps.

48:37.214 --> 48:39.307
We shouldn"t have brought either of them.

48:39.416 --> 48:43.113
It would have given us a chance to be alone
and get to know each other better.

48:44.121 --> 48:46.385
So, that"s what this is about, huh?

48:46.790 --> 48:48.382
I thought it was pretty obvious.

48:50.527 --> 48:52.688
You know, the first time I met you,

48:54.031 --> 48:56.727
well, you had me after hello.

48:58.702 --> 49:01.933
Look, let"s find Charlie first, okay?

49:02.372 --> 49:05.000
Then we can talk
about what other movie lines you know.

49:06.944 --> 49:11.210
First you said you didn"t like it out here,
and then it was too cold,

49:11.315 --> 49:14.011
now you wanna waste your time
looking for Charlie goofball.

49:14.117 --> 49:16.881
You certainly bitch and moan a lot.
You know, I thought you"d be grateful

49:16.987 --> 49:18.887
I asked you along,
considering the alternative.

49:29.099 --> 49:30.999
You guys?

49:31.335 --> 49:33.929
Charlie, is that you?

49:44.047 --> 49:46.015
Mail order piece of crap.

49:47.384 --> 49:48.646
It doesn"t work.

49:54.524 --> 49:56.924
Here, this is for you.

50:00.998 --> 50:03.091
This has got explosive shells in it.

50:05.035 --> 50:08.266
And this, this is a shark stick.

50:08.939 --> 50:11.840
Works like a shotgun, but under water.

50:11.975 --> 50:14.842
One shot from this
will take the head right off a great white.

50:15.512 --> 50:18.345
You"re not a tranquilizer dart
sort of guy, are you?

50:19.750 --> 50:21.411
Damn straight.

50:21.518 --> 50:26.922
If we run into this mythical ""crocodile""
of yours, let"s get one thing straight.

50:27.024 --> 50:30.516
I don"t want any of your EPA,
endangered species crap.

50:30.627 --> 50:32.356
-Are we on the same page?
-Yeah.

50:34.564 --> 50:37.658
God, Charlie. If you wanna be
a Peeping Tom, l"ll save you the trouble.

50:39.603 --> 50:44.768
What the... Ellie, Aaron!
There"s another one of those deer things.

50:56.453 --> 50:57.647
What"s that?

50:59.689 --> 51:00.917
Where"d it come from?

51:03.560 --> 51:05.084
I"m not even sure I heard it.

51:08.265 --> 51:09.562
Ellie.

51:14.104 --> 51:16.095
So, what do you think did this?

51:16.907 --> 51:18.169
I bet it was a shark.

51:20.944 --> 51:22.275
A big shark, a Megalodon.

51:23.180 --> 51:26.206
A megalo-what?
What the hell have you been smoking?

51:26.850 --> 51:28.818
That"s Charlie Burman,
he"s a college student.

51:28.919 --> 51:33.322
He"s here on a backpacking trip.
He"s friends with this guy I know.

51:34.558 --> 51:37.356
I came out here to find my girlfriend
to stop her from doing something stupid.

51:39.196 --> 51:42.757
Yeah, well, it seems like coming out here
was already pretty stupid.

51:45.902 --> 51:47.699
Sorry about your friend.

51:48.271 --> 51:52.537
I hated him. He"s an idiot and a pervert.

51:53.844 --> 51:57.302
Yeah? Then l"m sorry he smells so bad.

52:13.096 --> 52:14.358
So, what do we do now?

52:14.965 --> 52:17.126
In your case, l"d finish high school.

52:17.234 --> 52:19.930
Until then, get back to the lake
and find our guns.

52:21.571 --> 52:22.799
They"re back.

52:23.306 --> 52:27.037
Connor, come away from the window.
They can smell you through the glass.

52:27.144 --> 52:29.772
-ls that true?
-I don"t know, honey. Just...

52:41.892 --> 52:43.086
-Connor.
-Dad!

52:46.830 --> 52:47.956
Nathan!

52:48.365 --> 52:50.765
Susan, stay away from the window!

52:52.235 --> 52:54.135
The bathroom.
There"s thick walls in the bathroom.

52:54.237 --> 52:55.431
Help me with Vica.

52:59.976 --> 53:01.773
Let them get closer.

53:03.847 --> 53:05.838
Lay down. Here you go.

53:08.585 --> 53:09.574
Five,

53:12.022 --> 53:15.185
four, three...

53:15.292 --> 53:16.919
Down, honey. Down.

53:17.794 --> 53:20.490
...two, one.

53:43.687 --> 53:45.882
Honey, it"s fine. Stay here, okay?

53:45.989 --> 53:47.286
-But, Mom...
-Connor!

54:12.382 --> 54:14.009
Oh, my God.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.981
-Nathan!
-Hey, you okay?

54:48.652 --> 54:50.916
-Where"s Connor?
-Dad!

54:51.021 --> 54:53.353
-Connor! Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

55:31.094 --> 55:33.187
-Tony?
-Open up.

55:40.837 --> 55:43.203
I officially owe you an apology.

55:46.543 --> 55:49.944
Great. Now she"s gone.
Where the hell is she?

55:50.347 --> 55:51.609
Tara!

55:53.116 --> 55:56.483
No. No. No! No!

55:58.088 --> 56:00.318
She was... She was...

56:01.591 --> 56:05.687
It"s okay. It"s okay. Come on. Come on.
It"s okay. It"s okay.

56:05.795 --> 56:09.026
Don"t worry. Don"t worry.
It"s going to be okay.

56:19.142 --> 56:20.734
Could be a gator.

56:24.814 --> 56:29.342
I"m sure she"s fine,
this damsel in distress of yours.

56:30.720 --> 56:35.282
This is about another guy. Yeah.
She goes on a camping trip without you,

56:35.392 --> 56:40.455
so you hire a hunting guide
to help you stalk her through a state forest.

56:40.563 --> 56:41.757
Totally normal.

56:44.567 --> 56:46.728
For a complete jealous psycho.

56:47.837 --> 56:49.702
What she do,
forget her chastity belt at home?

56:50.740 --> 56:54.335
It"s a little more complicated than that,
and it"s not your damn problem.

56:55.245 --> 56:56.507
Not my problem?

56:56.613 --> 57:01.016
Hey, getting you all back in one piece
is my responsibility,

57:01.184 --> 57:04.017
and I take it very seriously,
thank you very much.

57:04.587 --> 57:06.680
So the least you could do

57:06.790 --> 57:11.090
is drop your ""l got a stick
up my college educated butt"" attitude.

57:14.164 --> 57:17.258
Yes, she came with another guy.

57:21.438 --> 57:22.871
Damn, l"m good.

57:26.376 --> 57:30.210
Hey, now guess what I found.

57:34.751 --> 57:39.779
Now, before we all got unceremoniously
jacked from my boat,

57:39.989 --> 57:42.753
we were following a tracking signal
from an elk.

57:42.859 --> 57:44.690
Now that elk, it seems, is actually

57:44.794 --> 57:48.286
passing through the digestive tract
of our gator friend.

57:51.901 --> 57:55.200
I"m sorry to put it this way,
but predators go to where their food is.

57:55.305 --> 57:59.264
So whatever killed smelly over there
knows where your girlfriend is.

57:59.375 --> 58:01.775
Now, all we have to do is follow him. Okay?

58:04.581 --> 58:07.550
Come on, baby. Come on, talk to Mama.

58:09.619 --> 58:10.881
Yes.

58:14.290 --> 58:17.350
We could go to that guy"s cabin
across the lake, try to find some help.

58:17.460 --> 58:18.449
Relax.

58:18.561 --> 58:20.722
That guy who works for the state,
he"d know who to call.

58:20.830 --> 58:23.355
We don"t need any help, I can handle this.

58:26.002 --> 58:29.096
Isn"t this what you wanted?
A bit of time away from the world?

58:29.205 --> 58:34.233
I wanted to forget about Brett for a few days.
Not get lost in the land of the lost.

58:35.111 --> 58:38.410
Hell, at least if Brett was here,
he wouldn"t give up on finding his friends.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.278
Well, you seem to have forgotten
about him all right.

58:41.684 --> 58:46.348
Look, l"m just trying to help. That"s all.

58:50.226 --> 58:55.630
Seriously? My best friend is missing.
We need to get help.

59:18.588 --> 59:19.816
Nothing bigger than a trout?

59:24.827 --> 59:28.024
I"d say that thing"s
a little bigger than a goddamn trout!

59:29.933 --> 59:34.529
I know this is just a job for you,
but everyone I have left is in this room,

59:34.637 --> 59:37.936
and they"re in danger because I trusted you.

59:39.442 --> 59:41.000
It"s gotta be 25 feet long.

59:41.678 --> 59:44.943
I screwed up. Is that what you wanna hear?
I"m sorry.

59:45.048 --> 59:48.711
The big one, I have no idea.
It could have been dropped from the sky.

59:48.818 --> 59:50.251
Yeah, dropped from...

59:56.759 --> 59:57.817
The elk.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:04.158
Three years ago, the EPA re-introduced elk
just down the river.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.660
Predators move towards their food.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:13.208
It is possible that it didn"t show up
on your sonar because it wasn"t in the lake.

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:16.437
Question is, why"d they come back here?

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:17.535
I don"t...

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.706
I mean, did the big one follow the elk
into the area?

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:20.783
I don"t know.

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:26.179
It"s an answer for the big one,
but the smaller ones,

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.816
they"ve been here for months.
Talk to your son.

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.898
Hey, l"m gonna go check and see
what kind of shampoo you use.

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:50.340
You knew about them?

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:01.919
Come here. Come here.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.151
Is this where you"ve been going
on your bike every day?

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.761
You know, they almost killed Vica?
You know they can kill you?

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:15.800
-Never hurt me.
-Listen! They"re not your friends.

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:20.866
They"re wild animals. And wild animals
live by a set of rules to ensure their survival.

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:24.572
One of the rules is that they eat
anything smaller than they are.

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:29.247
Do you understand that?
They"re not your friends.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:33.448
It was just something cool to play with.
Both of you left me alone.

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.154
You care more about your stupid elk
than me,

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:38.250
and Mom"s always working.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:43.030
You know, I thought it was a rule of nature
that parents took care of their kids.

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:45.366
My mistake.

01:02:05.588 --> 01:02:06.555
Hey.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.818
So, still think we can get a good price
for this place?

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:28.877
It"s a fixer-upper, real curb-appeal,
pets included.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:35.646
Yeah. And l, for one, am ready
to say goodbye to lake-side living forever.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.947
Sweets, I think we should
make a break for it.

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:44.049
I don"t think Vica"s gonna make it if we wait

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.219
and we still have a couple hours
of daylight left.

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.820
-Yeah, but she can"t walk.
-We can carry her.

01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.129
I know you"re scared.

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:59.436
But with Willinger covering us,
we should be able to make it.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.204
Okay.

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.148
You sure?

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:15.552
We"re gonna have to get the car close
if we"re gonna get everyone inside.

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:17.649
-All right.
-Okay.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:22.755
Connor, take care of your mother. Okay?

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.059
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.670
Looks like
we"re actually gonna do this thing.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:32.932
I love you.

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.414
-lf something happens...
-lt won"t.

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:48.948
But if it does, l"ll keep Connor safe, okay?

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:52.254
Well, I was gonna say, ""Come save us.""

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:09.900
Let"s do this.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.225
Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.296
Go.

01:04:30.533 --> 01:04:32.057
-Let"s go!
-l"m trying!

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.085
That one"s new!

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:02.289
Mom, Mom, what are you doing?

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:04.025
Connor, stay here. I mean it.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:09.703
-Mom, you have to press the red button.
-What?

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:16.375
-How do you know that stuff?
-lt"s always the red button.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.247
Mom!

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.010
Susan, get back in the house.

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:30.351
Susan!

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:39.556
Mom!

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.338
Hey! Get away from her.

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:52.439
Come on.

01:05:58.354 --> 01:05:59.878
No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:22.167
Susan, get to the cabin!

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:26.972
Go now! Go!

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:38.550
It"s locked!

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:44.356
-Vica!
-Vica, open the door.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.230
-Vica!
-Vica!

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:48.633
Open the door!

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:05.219
Go, go. Back there.

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.789
-I wanna help!
-Now, Connor!

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:13.126
Vica! Vica!

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.129
He"s coming through.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.579
You got us turned around.
I don"t even know which way camp was.

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:42.816
I heard a noise towards this way.

01:07:42.925 --> 01:07:45.758
You heard gunshots.
Do we really wanna go towards gunshots?

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:48.193
We wanna go towards...

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.870
Oh, my God!

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:59.074
Oh, my God. We need to get the hell
away from here. Now!

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:00.904
-Tara!
-Who the hell cares about Tara?

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:02.341
-Get up. Don"t cry. Come on.
-I can"t.

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.413
-I can"t.
-l"m not gonna say it again.

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:07.744
Get up, damn it.
Stop being a little bitch and get up.

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:11.649
Look, l"m going this way
with or without you.

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.453
-Look, it"s Brett"s jacket. Brett"s jacket.
-What, are you crazy?

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.924
I don"t know what the hell is going on here,
but we need to leave.

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.288
I think he"s looking for me.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:25.500
You can"t be serious.
You think Brett gives a rat"s ass about you?

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.296
You think he cares enough about you
to get his shoes dirty?

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:31.532
If that were true, you wouldn"t be here
with me in the first place.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.371
He"s cheating on you, Ellie,
and everybody at school knows it but you.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:40.278
No, no, no, no.
Maybe he heard the gunshots.

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.247
Or maybe, maybe he fired them.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:45.149
Why do you put him on such a pedestal?

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:48.519
He doesn"t give a rat"s ass about you,
he told me so himself.

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:52.126
He"s not out looking for you.

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:56.220
He"s back at school, probably
in some freshman"s dorm room right now.

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.256
We got a camp a few miles away from here.

01:08:58.367 --> 01:09:00.733
We find the camp
and we can find our way home.

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.934
No, no.
We"ve been turned around for an hour now.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.009
The only way we know
is towards the gunshots.

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:13.707
Make your choice. Let someone who really
cares about you save you,

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:18.042
or you can go crying to Brett like usual.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:24.385
No. Please, please don"t leave me.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.394
You go in that direction
and you"re walking alone.

01:09:27.496 --> 01:09:29.020
Please come with me.

01:09:30.765 --> 01:09:32.734
Aaron! Aaron.

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.690
This is actually the most fun
l"ve had in quite a while.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:04.795
Some fun. I can"t tell if l"m excited,

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.834
or if l"m going to throw up in my mouth
from the terror.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.564
-Just in case it"s the latter.
-All right.

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.370
We don"t even know
what the hell this thing is yet,

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:22.507
and l"m already picking out
a spot on my wall for its head.

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:27.315
You know what?
Maybe it"s mutating and has two heads.

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:30.218
If that happens to be the case,
I get them both.

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.191
If there"s three heads, you can have one.

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:34.592
Guys, I can hear you. My girlfriend?

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.991
You know, if he wants one of the heads,
l"m not giving him one of mine.

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.431
He can"t have mine neither.

01:10:39.535 --> 01:10:41.628
I didn"t come out here to fight wild animals.

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:45.332
Hey, hey, you know what? Look, we can"t
find your girlfriend if we"re all gator crap.

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:51.171
Last chance, Brett. You gonna tell us
why you"re stalking your own girlfriend?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.611
Wait a minute.

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:55.741
If this is about a restraining order,
there are ways around that.

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.842
Believe me, I know.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.715
She"s being lied to, about me.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:07.156
There"s this guy, Aaron. He"s a grad student.
He was tutoring her for a while.

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:10.527
He told her there was another girl and
he used that opportunity to get between us.

01:11:10.633 --> 01:11:12.498
And now, he takes her with him on this trip

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.068
and you can only guess
what he"s hoping to do with her.

01:11:14.536 --> 01:11:15.867
I love it out here.

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.035
Where"s Dr. Phil when you need him?

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:24.377
Who"s Dr. Phil?

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:41.456
It"s not her.

01:11:46.702 --> 01:11:47.828
Oh, my God. It"s Tara.

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:50.598
-Brett, get back.
-lt"s her best friend. She must be close.

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:54.233
We gotta find her. Ellie! Can you hear me?

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:55.435
Shut up.

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:57.102
Well, that"s one way to bring them closer.

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:58.873
Can you hear me?

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.506
Shut up! Jonas, you ready for this?

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.217
-Try not to mess up its head.
-Heads.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.447
Ellie!

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:34.107
Man, that"s gotta be the hottest thing
l"ve ever seen.

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:56.371
Shit.

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.502
He"s awake.

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.240
-All right, get Connor ready to run.
-Right.

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:16.851
Need a bigger gun.
Definitely need a bigger gun.

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.260
Wait!

01:13:20.362 --> 01:13:21.329
Stop!

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:22.618
What was I thinking?

01:14:22.724 --> 01:14:24.248
Give me that.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:30.962
I"m afraid that I have to ban you
from ever participating

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:34.433
in one of my hunting expeditions,
ever again.

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:37.664
Something in the contract
about not blowing holes in the guide.

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.968
No complaints from me.

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:43.670
That bastard ruined my pants
and he stole my knife.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.174
Well, you stabbed him in the face.

01:14:46.748 --> 01:14:50.445
Yeah, I know. And I would have
carved my name in his hide

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:52.383
had it not got stuck in his head.

01:14:52.821 --> 01:14:54.220
As for your bellyaching,

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:58.385
it"s not the first time
l"ve been shot by someone I know.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.826
God! It is the first time l"ve been hit.

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:11.201
I"m afraid l"m not going to be able
to walk out of here.

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:17.334
The boat.

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:24.719
The boat? Yeah. Getting in the water
sounds like a fine idea to me, college boy.

01:15:24.953 --> 01:15:26.921
Well, unless you can think of another way.

01:15:27.022 --> 01:15:29.582
Actually, no, I can"t.

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:33.022
No way to keep our orientation
with the sun going down.

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:35.824
When we get in the boat, where do we go?

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:38.228
Only one place to go.

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:43.169
There"s a cabin on the other side of the lake.

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:48.736
I"m having a bit of a misunderstanding
with the owner,

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:54.282
so if anybody"s there when we get there,
just keep the elk poaching on the down low.

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:03.316
I"m the one with the injured leg,
Rambo, okay? Let"s go.

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:04.483
What about Ellie?

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:09.152
We can"t... We can"t go looking for her now.
We wouldn"t know where to look.

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:12.563
-You think she"s dead, don"t you?
-I didn"t say that.

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.993
Look, I can"t know for sure,

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:19.267
but we wouldn"t do her any good
if we get ourselves killed, would we?

01:16:19.374 --> 01:16:22.366
Those were crocodiles.
I"ve read enough about crocodiles

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:25.378
to know they don"t stop killing food
just because they"re full.

01:16:25.814 --> 01:16:28.305
They also don"t travel very far
if they don"t have to. She"s nearby.

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:33.445
Whatever you do, do not start screaming
like you did the last time.

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.250
She"s my girlfriend!

01:16:35.357 --> 01:16:37.587
If you had any kind of normal relationships,
you"d understand.

01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:39.523
Normal?

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:47.165
Jonas and I chase
after a killer crocodile for you,

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.567
practically playing 20 questions

01:16:49.671 --> 01:16:54.040
trying to figure out what would drive you
to follow Ellie in here to begin with.

01:16:54.142 --> 01:16:58.408
And may I point out that we didn"t
even know the damsel"s name

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:01.778
until you start screaming it
at the top of your lungs,

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:06.047
attracting that monster that came out
of the woods and bit off Jonas" head.

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:11.281
And how the hell do you know
I don"t have any normal relationships, huh?

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:15.329
I know all about you.
All about your boo-hooing about Miss Ellie,

01:17:15.497 --> 01:17:18.830
but did you ask me one question,
one question about me and my life?

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:20.060
Okay!

01:17:23.438 --> 01:17:24.427
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:31.042
No. No, I don"t have a boyfriend, dumbass.

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:33.540
That was hypothetical.

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:40.213
Now that you know all about me,
let"s get in the boat and go someplace safe.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:42.818
No, I won"t.

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:44.585
-Really?
-Not without Ellie.

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:55.066
Fine, we"ll see how you like being dragged.

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:17.357
-Johnny Law.
-Nathan, actually.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.952
I would have introduced myself last time,
but when I asked for your hunter"s license

01:18:21.063 --> 01:18:22.928
you spit tobacco juice on my shoes.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:25.659
Yeah? I"m a shy girl.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:33.035
You know, you got a bit of an infestation
of a very unusual variety out there.

01:18:34.276 --> 01:18:36.107
Yeah, it looks like they got you pretty bad.

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:38.679
There were four of us. And the other two

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:45.817
didn"t fare as well.

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.316
But the crocs didn"t shoot me.

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:53.957
-That one did.
-I already said I was sorry.

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:58.595
Thanks for taking us in,
but we need to get back out there.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.497
-l"m Brett, by the way.
-Nathan.

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:02.229
Hey. Susan. This is Connor.

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:04.271
Why would you wanna go back outside?
Are you crazy?

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:06.636
Because my girlfriend"s out there
on the lake.

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:10.510
We were looking for her
when Reba decided to come here instead.

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:14.207
It"s better off behind a closed door
than running around in the dark.

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:17.080
Exactly why we need to get back on the boat
and find Ellie.

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.379
We"ve been trapped in here for hours

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.978
and there"s the very real possibility
that help isn"t coming.

01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.818
Now, we can"t let you take
our only means of transportation

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:23.948
and go and get yourself killed.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:27.358
Especially when that only means
of transportation belongs to me.

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:31.159
We get back in the boat. We find Ellie,
and then we get the hell away from here.

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.598
Ellie"s on the lake.
Now we need to get to safety.

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.169
That"s connecting to the river
and going down to town.

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.328
Those are opposite directions.

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.838
No! This isn"t up for debate.
We"re not leaving her.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.135
We don"t even know where she is.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.370
Now my wife and my son are right here
and I can"t risk their lives

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:45.469
based on the chance or the possibility
that she might be out there.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:48.572
Sensible conversation
didn"t get me very far with her.

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.547
I"m sorry to have to do this.

01:19:55.991 --> 01:19:58.221
I already shot someone today.
I don"t mind doing it again.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:19:59.554
Get away from the door.

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:02.191
Now"s a fine time to grow yourself a pair.

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:10.368
I will come back for you, promise.
Just as soon as I find her.

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.146
Ellie!

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:38.325
Ellie!

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.225
Brett?

01:20:41.069 --> 01:20:43.094
Ellie!

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.368
Ellie!

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:51.873
Brett!

01:20:52.247 --> 01:20:53.737
Ellie!

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.542
Brett!

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:04.057
Be back sooner than I thought.

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:06.252
Brett! Brett!

01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:07.791
I"m coming back!

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.794
Brett, l"m here!

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:11.664
Ellie!

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:15.964
I"m here, baby. I"m here.
I knew. I knew. Brett!

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:24.442
Connor, get in the bathroom
and lock the door. Go!

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:46.359
Brett!

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:47.492
No, no.

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.832
Oh, my God. I knew. I knew.

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.667
Move away from the water!

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.498
What?

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:57.806
Get away from the water!
Get away from the water!

01:22:24.739 --> 01:22:25.797
Ellie!

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:31.776
Oh, my God!

01:22:42.824 --> 01:22:44.314
What is that?

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:51.359
-l"m so sorry.
-Hey...

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:53.297
Hey, hey. No. You don"t need to apologize.

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:56.165
-l"m sorry for going with him. With Aaron.
-Don"t apologize. Don"t.

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.171
No. No, don"t apologize.

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:05.646
-I love you. I love you.
-I love you.

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:13.813
Ellie, go. Go now. Go! Run! Now!

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:18.751
Oh, my God. What is... What is that?

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:25.693
Oh, my God!

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.783
Nicely done.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:53.460
Let"s get the hell out of here, now.

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:04.836
That"s okay.
I can always come back for the head later.

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:09.970
Connor, stay close.

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:16.109
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:24:17.385 --> 01:24:20.252
-Help me. It killed... It killed him.
-Who? Who?

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:21.413
-Brett?
-Brett.

01:24:21.523 --> 01:24:24.822
-Get us in the boat, now!
-Right. Go! Go! Connor, come.

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.755
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:33.295
Keep trying.

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:40.332
Okay, plan B.

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:49.711
Here we go.

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:52.852
Yeah, I think we"re safe.

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.014
What is that?

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:01.387
Go. Go. Go. Come on. Go.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.229
Got her?

01:25:12.073 --> 01:25:13.597
-Hello!
-Hello!

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:14.732
Come on!

01:25:16.077 --> 01:25:17.169
Over there.

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:20.372
What makes you think Dimitri"s
not gonna have locked his doors?

01:25:28.089 --> 01:25:29.147
What now?

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:34.085
After you.

01:25:42.704 --> 01:25:44.569
-Okay, let"s put her down.
-l"ll call for help.

01:25:44.672 --> 01:25:45.696
All right.

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:49.002
-Does anybody have a quarter?
-No. No.

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:51.578
-lt"s 91 1, you don"t need any money.
-Okay, okay.

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:09.795
No, no, no, no, no. It"s going to be okay.
We"re gonna get out of here.

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:26.906
What about Connor? This is all my fault.
I should have been there for him.

01:26:27.015 --> 01:26:28.107
This is my fault.

01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:48.692
It"s you. Little Bickerman! Don"t you...

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:55.435
Oh, my God! Run. Go, go, go!

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:36.682
Help! Help! Help!

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.480
Help!

01:27:43.057 --> 01:27:45.355
Help! Help!

01:28:10.952 --> 01:28:13.420
Connor! Susan! Backdoor"s open. Go!

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:31.694
No keys.

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:34.297
-Don"t you know how to hot-wire?
-l"m a zoologist.

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:36.907
-Connor!
-Connor?

01:28:40.748 --> 01:28:41.806
Keys.

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:46.214
This is the one and only time
you"re allowed to steal something.

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:18.551
Connor. Go.

01:29:34.736 --> 01:29:37.170
-Are we 07 or 08?
-07!

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.251
Connor!

01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:58.220
Dad! Lighter!

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:21.081
-Nate! Nate!
-No. Dad!

01:30:57.718 --> 01:31:01.347
I would like to present to you today
an absolutely extraordinary case,

01:31:01.889 --> 01:31:05.290
and proof that we are not in control.

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:11.556
We"re not in control of our jobs,
we"re not in control of our children

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:16.098
and we are certainly not in control
of this planet.

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:20.271
There are no hard and fast rules in nature.

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:25.542
There"s no way to create a system
by which we can catalog and analyze

01:31:25.646 --> 01:31:28.308
and predict where an animal is gonna go

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:32.575
or what an animal is gonna do.

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.322
Having said all that,
I would like to now regale you

01:31:36.424 --> 01:31:42.056
with the story of a most unique species,
the Maine River Crocodile.

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:46.130
For the record, it"s extinct.

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:52.263
Come along.

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:57.607
So, did you guys have time
to read the pamphlets? Anyone?
