FORTUNE AND MEN'S WEIGHT

00:08.903 --> 00:11.823
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

00:11.990 --> 00:16.579
- How does a beer sound?
- I finish 'em before they get a word in.

00:19.498 --> 00:23.795
Aren't you a bit dressed up
to come here and suck on taps?

00:23.962 --> 00:28.633
If you must know, I've other plans
for this evening. I've a date.

00:29.593 --> 00:32.012
- Who is it?
- A blind date.

00:32.179 --> 00:35.474
- Dangerous.
- Walking into a minefield.

00:35.641 --> 00:39.688
A friend set us up.
He assures me she's perfect for me.

00:39.855 --> 00:41.899
That's what they all say.

00:42.065 --> 00:47.029
She had good table manners, great
personality and an excellent posture?

00:47.195 --> 00:50.074
They always make it sound good.

00:50.241 --> 00:54.120
As a matter of fact,
he said she was easy on the eye.

00:54.287 --> 00:56.707
You're a dead man, Norm.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.458 --> 02:17.713
- Where do you want it?
- Want what? I didn't order that.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.716
- Cheers, right?
- Yeah.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.221
Coach, did you buy this?

02:24.388 --> 02:28.642
- Not me, Sam.
- Your name is on the invoice.

02:28.809 --> 02:31.729
It's a mistake. Why would I buy a crate?

02:35.900 --> 02:39.362
- It's an antique scale.
- I bought the scale.

02:39.529 --> 02:43.242
Now that I look at it, I'm disappointed.

02:44.785 --> 02:47.496
We're in a hurry. Can you sign it?

02:47.663 --> 02:54.087
Why did you do this? Don't buy anything
for the bar without checking with me.

02:54.254 --> 03:00.511
I'm sorry, Sam. That salesman, I couldn't
resist him. He had a way about him.

03:00.678 --> 03:06.435
- One of those fast talkers?
- No. Big tall skinny guy with a beard.

03:06.602 --> 03:12.191
Reminded me of somebody in history.
The president who freed the slaves.

03:12.357 --> 03:17.071
- Abraham Lincoln?
- Only this guy wasn't nice at all.

03:17.238 --> 03:20.366
As a matter of fact,
he was kind of mean.

03:20.533 --> 03:25.789
He reminded me of that little guy
in Germany with the moustache.

03:25.956 --> 03:31.587
- Adolf Hitler?
- Don't play trivia with this guy.

03:31.754 --> 03:35.175
A cross between
Abraham Lincoln and Hitler?

03:35.342 --> 03:39.346
Normie, I don't know.
He was strange, Normie.

03:39.512 --> 03:43.309
He was dressed in black,
his eyes shined like coals

03:43.476 --> 03:46.729
and he had a deep voice
and he said to me,

03:46.896 --> 03:53.278
"This scale will not only tell you your
weight, but it will tell you your destiny. "

03:53.445 --> 03:56.198
- He had an accent?
- No.

03:57.950 --> 04:03.039
Then why did you say it like your weight
and your destiny?

04:03.206 --> 04:06.542
Just a little colour, Carla.

04:06.709 --> 04:13.634
- I'm calling him to say we don't want it.
- I'd like to see what it looks like.

04:13.801 --> 04:16.805
And it tells your fortune.

04:16.971 --> 04:19.224
- Go on. Open it.
- Goody.

04:19.391 --> 04:21.434
I'm still sending it back.

04:21.601 --> 04:24.980
Coach, give Norman a screwdriver,
please.

04:25.147 --> 04:28.609
I've got a big date.
I don't want to get pits.

04:28.776 --> 04:31.195
Come on. It won't be that hard.

04:36.284 --> 04:39.996
We'll stop you
before your shoes get squishy.

04:44.210 --> 04:49.465
Here's an opening hint from a guy
who's opened a lot of these rascals.

04:49.632 --> 04:54.263
If you smack this baby here,
it'll open up like a big walnut.

04:54.430 --> 04:57.474
That's the epicentre of the fulcrum.

04:57.641 --> 05:02.897
Step back, Diane.
This thing'll shear your kneecaps off.

05:08.904 --> 05:12.908
- Are you all right?
- I can't find my shoes, Clyde.

05:13.075 --> 05:18.039
- I think the dog got them.
- Sit right here. Here we go.

05:21.626 --> 05:23.920
Let's get her out.

05:28.801 --> 05:32.972
- Ain't that nice?
- I like it. Can we keep it?

05:33.139 --> 05:38.896
I'm afraid we're going to have to.
The number's been disconnected.

05:39.062 --> 05:41.482
The guy's obviously a conman.

05:41.648 --> 05:46.029
I knew he was a conman
the minute I laid eyes on him.

05:46.196 --> 05:52.203
As a collector of antiques, I think it might
some day be worth what you paid for it.

05:52.369 --> 05:55.372
Or a fraction thereof.

05:55.539 --> 06:01.546
Sam, the salesman also said, "This
scale is not being made any more. "

06:01.713 --> 06:05.759
"This one was in a cellar
for over 40 years. "

06:05.926 --> 06:09.513
Coach, you shouldn't have bought it.

06:09.680 --> 06:14.227
- This has been fun, but I gotta go.
- Normie, get on the scale.

06:14.393 --> 06:17.146
See how you'll make out tonight.

06:17.314 --> 06:22.569
Come on. It doesn't have
any fortunes left after all these years.

06:24.947 --> 06:27.367
Do you get tired of being wrong?

06:27.533 --> 06:30.954
"Your most troublesome problem
will be solved. "

06:31.120 --> 06:35.834
Sounds like you're going to get a trim
on the old antlers tonight.

06:36.001 --> 06:39.463
Norm,
what's your most troublesome problem?

06:39.630 --> 06:45.303
That's tough to say, Coach.
Let's see. I'm overweight, unemployed,

06:45.470 --> 06:49.432
separated, depressed,
starting to drink too much.

06:49.599 --> 06:53.854
I guess my biggest problem
is I've never been happier.

06:55.147 --> 06:59.610
- I'm going next.
- Wait. Men in uniform first, Carla.

06:59.777 --> 07:05.117
They love it. It will be bigger
than that amusement park in California.

07:05.283 --> 07:09.121
- The one with the mouse and the duck.
- Disneyland.

07:10.206 --> 07:13.584
You're tough, Sam,
but I'm gonna get you.

07:22.553 --> 07:26.725
- "Sanderson, Florist. "
- What's the occasion, Sam?

07:26.891 --> 07:28.935
For Diane.

07:29.102 --> 07:31.187
Did she die?

07:31.354 --> 07:34.607
- Of course not.
- Is she dying?

07:34.774 --> 07:37.820
Is she suffering? Throw me a bone.

07:37.987 --> 07:42.992
No. She'll be mad cos I didn't take her
to some stupid art show.

07:43.159 --> 07:47.873
Flowers are the way to calm her down.
Hi. Sanderson, Florist?

07:48.039 --> 07:53.463
There's my guy.
Give me a big smoocheroo.

07:57.967 --> 08:01.430
- You're not mad?
- Of course not.

08:01.597 --> 08:04.558
I just missed you so, you big lug.

08:07.019 --> 08:10.190
Keep up the good work.

08:10.356 --> 08:14.360
- Hey, everybody.
- What's up, Normie?

08:14.527 --> 08:19.784
- The corners of my mouth.
- Sounds like that blind date paid off.

08:19.950 --> 08:23.329
It turns out my buddy
played a trick on me.

08:24.413 --> 08:27.792
Guess who the date turns out to be?
My ex. Vera.

08:29.711 --> 08:33.423
Ready for the punch line?
We're back together.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.842
Norman, that's wonderfuI.

08:36.009 --> 08:39.679
I feeI so good,
I'd like to set up the entire bar.

08:39.847 --> 08:45.562
But as that's financially impossible,
I'll settle for buying Cliff a drink.

08:47.064 --> 08:51.068
Thank you, Norm. Chivas on the rocks.

08:51.235 --> 08:55.865
What, 12-year-old Scotch?
I was thinking more like a beer.

08:56.032 --> 08:59.077
Come on. This is great news.
You got Vera back.

08:59.244 --> 09:03.207
Yeah, Vera. Not Nastassja Kinsky. Vera.

09:04.458 --> 09:06.085
Beer, Coach.

09:06.252 --> 09:12.384
What's it like to go out on a blind date
and then you find out it's your own wife?

09:12.550 --> 09:16.096
Well,
we were both kind of nervous at first.

09:16.263 --> 09:22.645
Then we split some clams casino and a
little Chateaubriand, her favourite wine.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.899
Next thing, we went back
to what used to be our place

09:27.066 --> 09:30.654
and... we kind of made love.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.240
You can't kind of make love.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.076
You don't know Vera.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.498
- Oh, my God!
- What?

09:40.665 --> 09:42.500
It's happening!

09:42.667 --> 09:48.465
She's losing what's left of her grey
matter and I don't mean her underwear.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.678
- What's wrong?
- It's his fortune.

09:52.845 --> 09:57.225
The machine said his worst problem
would be solved and Vera's back.

09:57.392 --> 10:00.562
Carla, that was entirely fortuitous.

10:00.729 --> 10:06.736
You're right, Diane. My little card said
I would hear from a distant loved one.

10:06.902 --> 10:12.034
Sure enough, a half hour later,
my daughter in Pennsylvania calls me.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.329
No. That doesn't count.
She always calls you.

10:16.496 --> 10:21.627
- Pennsylvania's not that distant.
- She called me from California.

10:21.794 --> 10:25.006
She's on vacation there.

10:25.173 --> 10:29.178
It had nothing to do with your fortune,
or Norman's.

10:29.344 --> 10:35.142
Yeah? How about this? My fortune said,
"Time waits for no one. "

10:35.309 --> 10:41.316
Last night, I get home late and my kids
had started a fire cooking their dinner.

10:41.483 --> 10:45.403
- Explain that.
- Easy. You're an idiot.

10:47.656 --> 10:53.454
Look, there are things you eggheads
can't explain away in this world.

10:53.621 --> 10:57.876
Listen, nothing and nobody
controls what happens to us.

10:58.043 --> 11:01.296
You had a lucky piece when you pitched.

11:01.463 --> 11:06.844
A lot of good it did me. The only battles
I ever won in life, I won on my own.

11:07.929 --> 11:12.726
- That was brilliantly put.
- You said that to me a few days ago.

11:12.893 --> 11:17.105
But you remembered it
and used it in the proper context.

11:18.982 --> 11:22.570
Yeah, they should carve his face
on a mountain.

11:22.737 --> 11:29.077
You've been with Diane so long, you
can't see the facts in front of your nose.

11:29.244 --> 11:31.872
This machine has powers.

11:33.332 --> 11:37.711
I guess I should get on
and see what the future holds for me.

11:37.878 --> 11:40.131
Don't joke about this.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.678
What on earth are you doing?

11:44.844 --> 11:50.101
I'm warding off eviI spirits.
If you weren't stupid, you'd do the same.

11:50.268 --> 11:52.311
Preposterous.

11:58.735 --> 12:03.448
- What does the card say?
- What difference does it make?

12:04.534 --> 12:07.495
"Deception in romance proves costly. "

12:07.662 --> 12:11.416
You see.
You know how she feels about honesty.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.586
She likes it.

12:13.752 --> 12:16.797
- Honest as the day is long.
- Absolutely.

12:16.964 --> 12:20.175
Now, can we all go back to work,
please?

12:20.342 --> 12:22.387
Good idea.

13:00.786 --> 13:02.830
Are you all right?

13:02.996 --> 13:07.627
That's $20 postage due, sir,
and how are we today?

13:07.794 --> 13:13.049
- Cliff, you're in Cheers.
- Cheers. Yes, sir. I know where that is.

13:17.138 --> 13:21.976
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Just bruised my knee.

13:23.770 --> 13:27.482
I hope I'll be able
to do my postaI round tomorrow.

13:27.649 --> 13:32.989
- Do you want to get an X-ray?
- No. I'll just check it out here.

13:38.035 --> 13:40.080
I'm fine.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.919
Wait a minute, Cliff.

13:46.086 --> 13:49.966
You got a fortune from that machine.
What was it?

13:50.133 --> 13:52.260
What was it?

13:52.427 --> 13:56.306
Did it say anything
about falling down stairs?

13:56.472 --> 13:59.852
I remember. It was "Talk to bigwigs".

14:00.019 --> 14:04.064
- What "ooh"?
- I don't know yet.

14:04.231 --> 14:07.611
But there must be a connection.

14:08.862 --> 14:14.534
- You're not in the ballpark on this one.
- Wait. I got it. Bigwig, right?

14:14.702 --> 14:18.956
- Who is the biggest bigwig of them all?
- Sinatra.

14:28.008 --> 14:30.719
- No. Even bigger.
- Ronald Reagan.

14:30.886 --> 14:33.598
- No. Bigger.
- Sinatra.

14:41.982 --> 14:49.239
If you ask me who runs this country, it's
big oiI companies. Who runs Texaco?

14:49.407 --> 14:52.535
At my station, Dave and his son Herbie.

14:56.414 --> 14:58.626
Machmoud does the windows.

14:59.710 --> 15:04.048
You can't get much bigger
than Herbie, Dave and Machmoud.

15:05.132 --> 15:11.139
I am talking about God.
God is the biggest wig of them all.

15:11.306 --> 15:15.895
Cliff, did you pray
before you left home this morning?

15:17.939 --> 15:23.945
There you go. If you had prayed,
none of this would have happened.

15:26.699 --> 15:32.831
Come on. If you stretch it this far, you
can make anything out of those fortunes.

15:32.997 --> 15:37.001
- I hope this is nothing. Mine was bad.
- What was it?

15:37.168 --> 15:43.801
It said, "Your valuables are in jeopardy. "
I'll show it to you. It's in my wallet.

15:43.968 --> 15:46.262
Somebody lifted my wallet.

15:47.346 --> 15:51.476
Carla, will you take it easy?
He'll owe you the tip.

15:58.608 --> 16:01.028
How do you explain that, Sammy?

16:01.863 --> 16:05.533
- I found it.
- What do you say about that, Carla?

16:07.368 --> 16:13.709
It makes no difference. The machine has
been right up untiI now. I say it's eviI.

16:15.294 --> 16:19.841
It heard me. I'm sorry.

16:20.008 --> 16:22.427
Forgive me.

16:22.594 --> 16:27.224
Stop it. Everybody's looking.
Come on.

16:27.391 --> 16:34.024
I don't want to hear any more about it. It
is not magic. You can't take it seriously.

16:34.191 --> 16:39.529
It's a sad world we live in when Sam
Malone becomes the voice of reason.

16:42.867 --> 16:48.331
What am I talking for? Diane talks good.
Tell them how dumb they're being.

16:49.957 --> 16:52.377
You're being dumb.

16:57.507 --> 16:59.551
Had enough?

17:11.397 --> 17:17.948
Well, I guess I'd better get one more
just to make sure it's safe to go home.

17:27.833 --> 17:31.545
I can't look.
Sam, would you read it for me?

17:32.421 --> 17:34.841
Don't read it if it's terrible.

17:35.926 --> 17:39.346
It's OK.
"You will grow lips on your forehead. "

17:42.557 --> 17:45.186
Very funny.

17:47.397 --> 17:53.779
- It's OK. See you tomorrow.
- Good night, Carla. See you, kid.

17:53.946 --> 17:58.575
- Keep it up. You'll pay.
- Thank you, Carla. Bye-bye.

17:58.742 --> 18:01.496
- Night, Sam.
- Good night, Coach.

18:07.502 --> 18:10.923
- What are you doing?
- Seeing if I gained weight.

18:11.090 --> 18:15.636
- You didn't. Get off.
- What's wrong? You're acting strange.

18:15.803 --> 18:19.516
- I'm acting fine.
- Let me get my weight here.

18:19.683 --> 18:23.937
- Sam, don't.
- Will you tell me what's going on?

18:24.104 --> 18:27.066
You're coming unglued here.

18:28.776 --> 18:31.195
I feeI like I'm losing my mind.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.993
- That scale has me spooked.
- You're kidding me?

18:36.160 --> 18:41.123
You're the last person
I expect to fall for that voodoo stuff.

18:41.290 --> 18:45.336
- Do you remember that fortune I got?
- No.

18:48.339 --> 18:53.971
- "Deception in romance proves costly. "
- So?

18:54.138 --> 18:58.768
I took another man
to that show last night.

19:00.436 --> 19:02.522
You mean, like a guy?

19:05.066 --> 19:11.491
At least pay attention. He's a classmate
of mine. A male classmate.

19:11.657 --> 19:15.745
So you took some pimply wimp
from schooI. Big deaI.

19:15.912 --> 19:20.542
His complexion is as clear as mine
and we had a wonderfuI time.

19:23.003 --> 19:25.631
At the performance?

19:29.219 --> 19:32.472
Of course he took me home.

19:33.848 --> 19:35.935
And?

19:36.101 --> 19:40.397
I invited him in. We had coffee.
He left. That was it.

19:41.482 --> 19:47.072
Instant coffee
or did you grind the beans?

19:48.532 --> 19:53.246
It wasn't the same as it is with you.
I didn't grind them fine.

19:54.789 --> 19:57.667
You did grind the beans?

19:58.793 --> 20:01.712
All we did was talk.

20:02.965 --> 20:07.594
- You didn't kiss him?
- I kissed him good night. It was nothing.

20:07.761 --> 20:11.516
It was barely on the lips.
On the side. Very dry.

20:19.692 --> 20:22.111
I have to be honest.

20:22.278 --> 20:25.406
It was so good to talk to someone.

20:26.490 --> 20:31.121
I miss talking about the things
I can't talk about with you.

20:32.205 --> 20:35.709
I didn't tell you because you'd be angry.

20:35.875 --> 20:38.963
- I'm not angry.
- Of course you are.

20:39.130 --> 20:45.262
No, I'm not. As a matter of fact,
I'm kind of gratefuI.

20:45.429 --> 20:48.932
I think I see our relationship
in a new light.

20:50.183 --> 20:56.190
The truth is I don't fulfiI all your needs
and you don't fulfiI all mine.

20:56.357 --> 20:59.110
So maybe we should call it quits.

21:00.903 --> 21:06.618
What are you doing?
I have one innocent evening with a guy.

21:06.785 --> 21:12.042
I come to you to make a clean breast
of it and this is the reaction I get.

21:12.208 --> 21:17.589
You're even less understanding
than I feared. Fine. I want out of this.

21:17.756 --> 21:20.885
Out of what? I already broke it off.

21:22.636 --> 21:28.810
You said, "Maybe we should call it quits. "
I'm saying it's definitely over.

21:28.977 --> 21:33.523
Hey, I don't care what I said.
In my mind, it was definite.

21:33.690 --> 21:37.945
That ship has sailed.
Our relationship is through.

21:39.655 --> 21:45.661
No, we're not through,
unless I say we're through.

21:46.830 --> 21:51.210
We're through. Now we're through.

21:51.376 --> 21:55.799
I'm not having an argument
about who broke up with who first.

21:55.965 --> 22:01.513
With somebody I broke up with. I'm not
going to acknowledge your presence.

22:02.597 --> 22:09.021
Is anybody here? Somebody I used
to go with? No. It's just Diane. Silly me.

22:12.818 --> 22:15.821
- Don't do this.
- It's already done.

22:18.198 --> 22:22.370
Sam, please.
Please don't joke about this.

22:23.454 --> 22:25.498
I'm scared.

22:27.542 --> 22:33.549
We can't break up because a pile
of metaI springs said we were going to.

22:35.133 --> 22:37.386
There's too much at stake.

22:42.934 --> 22:44.978
I'm sorry.

22:46.062 --> 22:48.315
Forgive me.

22:48.482 --> 22:53.195
- Tell me you didn't break up with me.
- Of course I didn't.

22:53.362 --> 22:55.615
Then I'm first.

22:56.658 --> 23:01.246
- You are history.
- That was a rotten...

23:01.413 --> 23:06.752
Now I know why I broke up with you
long before you broke up with me.

23:08.963 --> 23:11.382
Who's talking?

23:12.425 --> 23:14.469
It's just my employer.

23:25.356 --> 23:28.943
Sam, we got a fortune.

23:29.110 --> 23:32.072
- So?
- Aren't you going to read it?

23:32.239 --> 23:34.366
No. What's the point?

23:38.746 --> 23:43.084
Our destiny may be in that card.
I know it. I can feeI it.

23:45.128 --> 23:50.092
- You're crackers. You know that?
- Then read it.

23:53.596 --> 23:55.639
OK. Fine.

23:59.269 --> 24:01.521
You sure we should do this?

24:02.647 --> 24:05.902
We've got to.
There might be no other way.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.112
All right.

24:09.781 --> 24:13.493
"Machine empty.
Order more fortunes today. "

24:51.410 --> 24:52.411
