<font color="#00FFFF">there's no secret,</font>

04:09.160 --> 04:11.359
<font color="#00FFFF">what I said to the boys and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">everybody,</font>

04:11.360 --> 04:14.919
<font color="#00FFFF">when you came down the stairs, I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">instantly felt an attraction</font>

04:14.920 --> 04:17.719
<font color="#00FFFF">particularly towards you, a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">connection and things.</font>

04:17.720 --> 04:21.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I think, like, from talking to you,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you are very engaging.</font>

04:21.839 --> 04:24.799
<font color="#00FFFF">Looking at you, you got beautiful</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">eyes and things like that.</font>

04:24.800 --> 04:27.919
<font color="#00FFFF">You are obviously very attractive.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You are a really nice girl.</font>

04:27.920 --> 04:31.240
<font color="#00FFFF">I get the impression that you are a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really open and honest, nice girl.</font>

04:35.720 --> 04:37.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you eyeing up the banana split?</font>

04:37.720 --> 04:39.999
<font color="#11FF11">I was just looking at your...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Presentation?</font>

04:40.000 --> 04:41.919
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Wanna try it?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah.</font>

04:41.920 --> 04:44.079
<font color="#FFFF00">What are you trying? </font><font color="#11FF11"> The banana.</font>

04:44.080 --> 04:48.440
<font color="#FFFF00">I've ate half of it in the kitchen,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">anyway.</font>

04:49.880 --> 04:53.240
<font color="#FFFF00">So, was that third choice or were</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you saving the best to last?</font>

04:54.360 --> 04:56.999
<font color="#11FF11">I'm not telling you that.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You're not telling me that?</font>

04:57.000 --> 04:59.359
<font color="#FFFF00">You're a little bit mysterious,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">aren't you?</font>

04:59.360 --> 05:01.519
<font color="#11FF11">Do you like it? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I find it quite</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">intriguing, yeah.</font>

05:01.520 --> 05:05.199
<font color="#FFFF00">Because quite a lot of people said</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that about me when I first came in.</font>

05:05.200 --> 05:07.319
<font color="#FFFF00">And I think people were shocked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about the decisions</font>

05:07.320 --> 05:09.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I have probably made in here. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah.</font>

05:11.120 --> 05:12.880
I don't think it...

05:14.000 --> 05:17.399
If we hadn't of came on here, we ever
would have met.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.919
And neither would we have had a
reason to.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.639
Obviously, you are a doctor, I'm a
car salesman.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.559
<font color="#00FFFF">That's what's great, the fact that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you can meet...</font>

05:25.560 --> 05:29.719
<font color="#00FFFF">It's funny, people always say to me,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I bet you want a really super geeky,</font>

05:29.720 --> 05:31.799
<font color="#00FFFF">intelligent girl, and obviously</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you are...</font>

05:31.800 --> 05:33.959
You don't want someone the same as
you.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.679
<font color="#00FFFF">No, but, obviously you are a very</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">switched on girl.</font>

05:36.680 --> 05:37.959
<font color="#00FFFF">People assume that.</font>

05:37.960 --> 05:39.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm like, hang on, it's not about</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that.</font>

05:40.000 --> 05:42.159
<font color="#00FFFF">It's about having a connection,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">being on a wavelength.</font>

05:42.160 --> 05:44.719
<font color="#00FFFF">That's nothing to do with what you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">do, where you are from,</font>

05:44.720 --> 05:48.519
<font color="#00FFFF">how much money you have, or that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">kind of stuff. It's all crap.</font>

05:48.520 --> 05:51.199
<font color="#FFFF00">So what are you like? Is this your</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">idea of a first date?</font>

05:51.200 --> 05:55.079
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah. I like doing activities and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">stuff.</font>

05:55.080 --> 05:57.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Would you go go jet skiing with me?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Yes!</font>

05:57.480 --> 06:00.799
<font color="#FFFF00">You said you were spontaneous. How</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">spontaneous?</font>

06:00.800 --> 06:03.319
<font color="#11FF11">Very spontaneous. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> All right.</font>

06:03.320 --> 06:06.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, I'm so serious with work, but</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">as soon as the doors are shut,</font>

06:06.800 --> 06:09.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I am a completely different person.</font>

06:09.080 --> 06:11.399
<font color="#11FF11">People say exactly the same thing</font>
<font color="#11FF11">about me.</font>

06:11.400 --> 06:13.199
<font color="#11FF11">Literally the exact same thing.</font>

06:13.200 --> 06:15.279
<font color="#FFFF00">Do you think we are similar? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah.</font>

06:15.280 --> 06:18.919
<font color="#00FFFF">It's very intense, because you are</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on top of each other 24/7.</font>

06:18.920 --> 06:21.399
<font color="#00FFFF">But you are thinking the worst right</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">now.</font>

06:21.400 --> 06:24.119
Obviously, I took it further with
him the other night,

06:24.120 --> 06:27.239
and I am sure it means something to
me. I never do a one night stand.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.639
If I'm doing something with you,
it's because I like you.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.639
For him then, two days later, to
potentially go on this date

06:34.640 --> 06:38.399
and think "Rosie is not for me",
that's embarrassing, again.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.759
<font color="#11FF11">So what's the deal with Rosie, then?</font>

06:40.760 --> 06:42.280
<font color="#FFFF00">D'you know what it is?</font>

06:43.360 --> 06:46.359
<font color="#FFFF00">I think things have been going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">reasonably well,</font>

06:46.360 --> 06:50.239
<font color="#FFFF00">but I'm quite open with the fact,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I tell her all the time,</font>

06:50.240 --> 06:51.999
<font color="#FFFF00">it is early doors.</font>

06:52.000 --> 06:55.599
<font color="#FFFF00">I openly say that we are not in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">category of, like, Jack and Dani,</font>

06:55.600 --> 06:57.399
<font color="#FFFF00">because I'm not that person.</font>

06:57.400 --> 06:59.279
<font color="#FFFF00">I would always give somebody the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">chance.</font>

06:59.280 --> 07:01.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Today, when I had a chat with her on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the swing,</font>

07:01.320 --> 07:03.399
<font color="#FFFF00">I said, if you think that I'm not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">going to give</font>

07:03.400 --> 07:05.879
<font color="#FFFF00">someone a chance that wants to speak</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to me, you're wrong.</font>

07:05.880 --> 07:08.119
<font color="#FFFF00">It is one of them things and I do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want to get to know you.</font>

07:08.120 --> 07:12.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I think, depending on how people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">act, I can't tiptoe around anyone,</font>

07:12.080 --> 07:13.759
<font color="#FFFF00">I won't walk on egg shells.</font>

07:13.760 --> 07:16.919
<font color="#11FF11">I feel like that is what you have</font>
<font color="#11FF11">been doing a little bit, though.</font>

07:16.920 --> 07:19.880
<font color="#FFFF00">There is a lot of territory being</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">marked, isn't there?</font>

07:22.120 --> 07:23.919
I obviously like you.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.119
But I want to make sure that you are
not just doing it

07:27.120 --> 07:30.519
because I have said that I like you
and you've had a bit of...

07:30.520 --> 07:33.599
I want you to like me for the right
reasons.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.599
<font color="#00FFFF">I could easily think, there's two</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">girls coming in, you know,</font>

07:36.600 --> 07:38.639
<font color="#00FFFF">they could be going for the single</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">guy.</font>

07:38.640 --> 07:40.599
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel confident that that is not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like that.</font>

07:40.600 --> 07:43.919
That is why I wanted to reassure you
that from the start,

07:43.920 --> 07:47.359
before anything happened, you were my
top three.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.959
I think it is always important to
know that, because...

07:49.960 --> 07:53.359
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel a connection. You can't fake</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a connection with someone.</font> No.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.679

<font color="#00FFFF">I think you're gorgeous.</font>
Thank you.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.320
I think you're gorgeous too. <font color="#00FFFF">Thank</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you.</font>

08:09.800 --> 08:12.600
What are we doing? One kiss, cos it's
our first date.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.399
<font color="#00FFFF">Thank you very much for the date.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Thanks for asking me, and maybe...</font>

08:23.400 --> 08:25.559
No problem.
I hope we have another one.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.239
<font color="#00FFFF">I really hope so too.</font>

<font color="#11FF11">Was it like... Tell me when to stop.</font>

09:42.600 --> 09:45.119

<font color="#00FFFF">I wanted to flip the table.</font>

09:56.440 --> 09:58.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Of course, I just took a sip of the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wine instead.</font>

09:58.960 --> 10:00.839
<font color="#00FFFF">But it was a great feeling.</font>

<font color="#11FF11">How did your one go?</font>

10:08.560 --> 10:13.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Like, from the moment I sat down,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that eye contact, the flirtiness,</font>

10:13.160 --> 10:15.879
<font color="#FFFF00">mate, she is funny as well.</font>

10:15.880 --> 10:19.479
<font color="#FFFF00">You know, but she is dry funny, like</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me. We are so similar.</font>

10:19.480 --> 10:22.879
<font color="#FFFF00">She was making remarks of, "how do</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you think Rosie will react?"</font>

10:22.880 --> 10:25.319
<font color="#FFFF00">And I was like, "I'm not worried</font>

10:25.320 --> 10:28.399
<font color="#FFFF00">just to know what I want".</font>
<font color="#11FF11">So, you know them both now.</font>

<font color="#11FF11">can he?</font>

10:42.840 --> 10:45.599
<font color="#11FF11">Zara's come through the door, he's</font>
<font color="#11FF11">seen her and thought,</font>

10:45.600 --> 10:47.119
<font color="#11FF11">"yep, prefer her, don't I?"</font>

10:47.120 --> 10:49.279
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know how he</font>
<font color="#11FF11">gets away with it.</font>

10:49.280 --> 10:51.799
<font color="#11FF11">He's like a God, isn't he?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">In his own right.</font>

10:51.800 --> 10:53.279
<font color="#11FF11">So, yeah, I think there's...</font>

10:53.280 --> 10:55.279
<font color="#11FF11">(IMITATING ADAM) ..no more Rosie.</font>

10:55.280 --> 10:56.720
<font color="#FFFF00">Who was your favourite date?</font>

10:58.520 --> 10:59.919
<font color="#11FF11">Hmm.</font>

10:59.920 --> 11:04.040
<font color="#11FF11">I dunno, probably Eyal or Adam were</font>
<font color="#11FF11">my favourites.</font>

11:05.720 --> 11:09.119
I think mine was Alex. <font color="#FFFF00">Really?</font>

11:09.120 --> 11:10.959
Yeah. <font color="#00FFFF">He ticks all the boxes.</font>

11:10.960 --> 11:14.119
<font color="#00FFFF">I said some girl is gonna be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">besotted with you, because</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you've got it all.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">I always tell him that. </font><font color="#11FF11"> He is fit.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

11:16.720 --> 11:18.480
So, yeah.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.959
<font color="#11FF11">Emotions are definitely running</font>
<font color="#11FF11">high.</font>

11:21.960 --> 11:24.239
<font color="#11FF11">Obviously, I know I have upset</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Rosie,</font>

11:24.240 --> 11:26.799
<font color="#11FF11">because my date with Adam went</font>
<font color="#11FF11">really well.</font>

11:26.800 --> 11:31.679
<font color="#11FF11">But I think people's maturity is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">really showing right now.</font>

11:31.680 --> 11:35.999
<font color="#FFFF00">How are you feeling?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Not good. Not good.</font>

11:36.000 --> 11:37.919
<font color="#FFFF00">You're not, are you? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> No.</font>

11:37.920 --> 11:41.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't suss her out, you know.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">She's frigging ballsy.</font>

11:41.160 --> 11:43.999
<font color="#00FFFF">She's just sat there and said he was</font>

11:48.040 --> 11:50.279
<font color="#00FFFF">I know I'm in camo, but Jesus.</font>

11:50.280 --> 11:52.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm gonna call them over.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">No, don't.</font>

11:52.640 --> 11:55.639

<font color="#00FFFF">fucking talk to me,</font>

12:00.040 --> 12:02.079
<font color="#00FFFF">don't let him come because</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we've called him over.</font>

12:02.080 --> 12:04.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Why ain't he coming over then?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Cos he's a bellend.</font>

12:04.720 --> 12:08.239
<font color="#11FF11">Who just called you? Dan, did you</font>
<font color="#11FF11">call Adam?</font>

12:08.240 --> 12:09.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Do I lose my shit?</font>

12:10.000 --> 12:11.879
<font color="#00FFFF">Do I just stop talking to him?</font>

12:11.880 --> 12:17.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's just stay pleasant, but he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">will be coming over, cos...</font>

12:17.320 --> 12:18.839
<font color="#11FF11">You all right?</font>

12:18.840 --> 12:21.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Have you missed us? </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, I have,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">actually.</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">You all right, Adam?</font> Yeah, I'm good.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.760
<font color="#FFFF00">Nice to see you.</font>

12:28.600 --> 12:30.399
<font color="#FFFF00">What's going on with you, anyway?</font>

12:30.400 --> 12:31.839
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, how was your date?</font>

12:31.840 --> 12:34.800
Me? My date was good. It was good.
She's a good girl.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.199
<font color="#00FFFF">Right, I want to talk to you, come</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on.</font>

12:38.200 --> 12:39.639
Who, me? <font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

12:39.640 --> 12:41.040
Yeah? <font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

12:46.440 --> 12:48.960
<font color="#FFFF00">He is acting a bit like a doughnut,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">though.</font>

12:50.880 --> 12:53.319
<font color="#11FF11">The thing is though, Dani, he does</font>
<font color="#11FF11">what he wants to do.</font>

12:53.320 --> 12:56.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Listen, you're gonna back him,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">because he's your mate,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I'm gonna back her.</font>

12:56.920 --> 12:59.360
<font color="#11FF11">It ain't nothing to do</font>
<font color="#11FF11">with us though, is it?</font>

13:02.000 --> 13:05.039
<font color="#00FFFF">What's actually going on with you?</font>
What do you mean?

13:05.040 --> 13:06.879
<font color="#00FFFF">You haven't spoken to me all day.</font>

13:06.880 --> 13:10.759
How have I not spoken to you all day?
<font color="#00FFFF">You've just ignored me, basically.</font>

13:10.760 --> 13:13.519
I haven't ignored you, I don't need
to reassure you.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.239
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not asking you to reassure me.</font>

13:15.240 --> 13:17.599
<font color="#00FFFF">It would be nice you to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">speak to me like normal.</font>

13:17.600 --> 13:19.759
<font color="#00FFFF">You haven't acted normal, for some</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">reason.</font>

13:19.760 --> 13:23.639
I've been exactly myself today. I've
been exactly how I normally am. <font color="#00FFFF">OK.</font>

13:23.640 --> 13:26.639
Why are you on the defence?
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not, I'm just, like...</font>

13:26.640 --> 13:29.999
If you're telling me you haven't had
a bee in your bonnet when I came over
it's ridiculous.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.999
<font color="#00FFFF">I haven't had a bee in my bonnet.</font>

13:32.000 --> 13:35.399
You've just been arsey from the
start. <font color="#00FFFF">I've not been arsey.</font>

13:35.400 --> 13:37.559
You're sitting there with a face
like a smacked arse.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I was laughing and smiling with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Dani.</font> Oh, you weren't.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.359
I'm not daft. I know when there's
something up.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.079
<font color="#00FFFF">There is something, you haven't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">spoken to me all day.</font>

13:46.080 --> 13:49.319
<font color="#00FFFF">You've been different, you can't say</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you haven't been.</font> I haven't been.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.919
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, my God, you definitely have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and everyone can see it.</font>

13:51.920 --> 13:54.839
As soon as I came over there, that
was arsey from the minute...

13:54.840 --> 13:56.599
<font color="#00FFFF">You were sat that far away from me,</font>

13:56.600 --> 13:58.439
<font color="#00FFFF">as if you didn't want to speak</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to me.</font>

13:58.440 --> 14:01.079
As soon as I spoke
about the date, it was a good date.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm glad you had a good date.</font>

14:02.640 --> 14:04.679
<font color="#00FFFF">It's not... It's not a thing for me.</font>

14:04.680 --> 14:06.119
It is.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.119
<font color="#00FFFF">It's genuinely not a thing.</font>

14:08.120 --> 14:10.119
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you wanna know something?</font>

14:10.120 --> 14:12.879
<font color="#00FFFF">You said you came here for something</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">real, yeah?</font> Yeah.

14:12.880 --> 14:16.599
<font color="#00FFFF">You're not gonna get something real</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">if you're always looking for more.</font>

14:16.600 --> 14:18.719
<font color="#00FFFF">You can't like every girl that comes</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in here,</font>

14:18.720 --> 14:20.359
<font color="#00FFFF">you can't just go off on me.</font>

14:20.360 --> 14:22.639
I don't like every girl that comes in
here.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.039
You asked us if I fancied Megan and
no, I don't.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.079
Yeah, probably do fancy Zara.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.919
Didn't really mean anything before
you acted like a child.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.279
<font color="#00FFFF">I haven't acted like a child at all.</font>
Well, we'll agree to disagree.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.119
<font color="#00FFFF">Stop being a dickhead. Come on.</font>
I'm not being a dickhead.

14:36.120 --> 14:39.879
<font color="#00FFFF">It's not nice when you, you've come</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">over and sit a metre away from me</font>

14:39.880 --> 14:42.759
<font color="#00FFFF">and you don't wanna touch me or be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">near me.</font>

14:42.760 --> 14:45.519
Oh, my God, you're looking into
everything.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.399
I'm just pissed off with that.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.879
I think it's ridiculous, to be quite
honest. <font color="#00FFFF">Sit down, please.</font> No.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.599
<font color="#00FFFF">Why?</font> I'm going now.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam, don't be...</font>

14:53.160 --> 14:55.599
<font color="#00FFFF">You're just being childish now.</font>

14:55.600 --> 14:57.520
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, for God's sake.</font>

15:00.200 --> 15:01.679
<font color="#11FF11">Do you want to comfort eat?</font>

15:01.680 --> 15:04.239
Pardon? <font color="#11FF11">D'you want to come and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">comfort eat?</font>

15:04.240 --> 15:07.879
<font color="#FFFF00">We're having ice cream.</font>
I'm going to go to the toilet first.
Thank you very much, though.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.839
<font color="#00FFFF">Classic Adam, using excuses,</font>

15:09.840 --> 15:12.719
<font color="#00FFFF">blaming me for his behaviour, shall</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we say.</font>

15:12.720 --> 15:15.639
<font color="#00FFFF">He is not content with any girl.</font>

15:15.640 --> 15:17.639
<font color="#00FFFF">He always thinks he has the power</font>

15:17.640 --> 15:19.519
<font color="#00FFFF">and he always thinks he deserves</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">better.</font>

15:19.520 --> 15:23.399
<font color="#00FFFF">He's just gone, "You've pushed me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">away in 48 hours, I fancy Zara".</font>

15:23.400 --> 15:26.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Is that what he said to you?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">He said he fancied her.</font>

15:26.560 --> 15:29.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you joking me?</font> He's a dickhead.

15:29.480 --> 15:34.119
<font color="#00FFFF">If he wants to go off and get</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">another girl that has come in,</font>

15:34.120 --> 15:35.999
<font color="#00FFFF">all he needs to do is say it.</font>

15:36.000 --> 15:39.519
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't need the excuses. Don't make</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">up shit excuses.</font>

15:39.520 --> 15:40.799
<font color="#11FF11">Has he said that though?</font>

15:40.800 --> 15:42.639
<font color="#00FFFF">He said he fancies Zara.</font>

15:42.640 --> 15:46.039
But don't blame it on you, just say,
"D'you know what? I fancy someone
else".

15:46.040 --> 15:49.239
<font color="#00FFFF">And now he's just stormed off and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">walked away and blamed it all on me.</font>

15:49.240 --> 15:50.879
<font color="#00FFFF">OK.</font>

15:50.880 --> 15:54.439
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought he liked me, Jack, I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">genuinely thought the last few days,</font>

15:54.440 --> 15:58.079
<font color="#00FFFF">the last seven days we have been in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">here,</font>

15:58.080 --> 16:02.799
<font color="#00FFFF">we've progressed in a nice way.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Maybe he is not ready for love.</font>

16:02.800 --> 16:05.399
<font color="#00FFFF">Maybe he needs to go back out and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">shag another 200 girls.</font>

16:05.400 --> 16:07.719
<font color="#00FFFF">Because this clearly isn't working</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for him.</font>

16:07.720 --> 16:09.319
<font color="#00FFFF">You can't keep looking for more.</font>

16:09.320 --> 16:11.359
<font color="#00FFFF">If you want love, you have to be</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">content.</font>

16:11.360 --> 16:13.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not being funny, I don't do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">things with people</font>

16:13.840 --> 16:15.399
<font color="#00FFFF">unless they mean something.</font>

16:15.400 --> 16:17.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I did it because I thought this was</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">something real.</font>

16:17.840 --> 16:19.479
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought we had something.</font>

16:19.480 --> 16:23.399
<font color="#00FFFF">And he has literally taken it and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thought, got what I want with her,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">onto the next one.</font>

16:23.400 --> 16:25.959
<font color="#FFFF00">He is not fair. How long can Adam</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get away with this for?</font>

16:25.960 --> 16:29.879
<font color="#FFFF00">It upsets me because he's not really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">admitting it.</font>

16:29.880 --> 16:33.839
<font color="#FFFF00">He's just making Rosie feel like it</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is all her fault,</font>

16:33.840 --> 16:36.559
<font color="#FFFF00">and "this is why I am doing it,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my head's been turned</font>

16:36.560 --> 16:40.439
<font color="#FFFF00">because of this". No, mate, you want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your cake and you want to eat it.</font>

16:40.440 --> 16:42.439
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not fair. I don't like it.</font>

16:42.440 --> 16:43.959
<font color="#00FFFF">That vile.</font>

16:43.960 --> 16:46.759
<font color="#00FFFF">That using and abusing people. You</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">can't do that.</font>

16:46.760 --> 16:50.080
<font color="#00FFFF">I thought he meant everything he</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">said.</font>

16:51.120 --> 16:53.679
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, fucking idiot, Rosie.</font>

16:53.680 --> 16:55.159
<font color="#00FFFF">You are an idiot.</font>
You're not.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.959
You liked him and he thought he was
being honest.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.919
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't believe I've done that to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">someone who literally just wants</font>

17:01.920 --> 17:04.398
<font color="#00FFFF">to dip his dick into any girl that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">walks in.</font>

17:04.400 --> 17:06.239
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't be arsed.</font>

17:06.240 --> 17:10.039
<font color="#00FFFF">As far as I am concerned with Adam,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I am done.</font>

17:10.040 --> 17:12.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not even gonna give him the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">chance to try and give</font>

17:12.800 --> 17:14.598
<font color="#00FFFF">me his wishy-washy excuses.</font>

17:14.599 --> 17:17.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I've had enough. What a little boy.</font>

17:17.839 --> 17:21.239
Better update my Adam cracking on
Love Island wallchart.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.559
It's like my World Cup wallchart, but
there's loads more rounds.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.398
And after Wes' date with Ellie, more
trouble is brewing

17:27.400 --> 17:29.319
over on the swing seat.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.599
<font color="#FFFF00">In the villa, if you care about</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">someone,</font>

17:32.600 --> 17:34.759
<font color="#FFFF00">if there's a situation where that</font>

17:34.760 --> 17:38.839
<font color="#FFFF00">person naturally feels insecure and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">jealous,</font>

17:38.840 --> 17:41.799
<font color="#FFFF00">and are standing off, in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">nicest way,</font>

17:41.800 --> 17:44.399
<font color="#FFFF00">to give you a chance to do what you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">want,</font>

17:44.400 --> 17:46.999
<font color="#FFFF00">because they don't want to suffocate</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you,</font>

17:47.000 --> 17:50.999
<font color="#FFFF00">I think it is your position to make</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an effort with them.</font>

17:51.000 --> 17:54.399
<font color="#FFFF00">If I stand off from you to give you</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">space... </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You don't need to.</font>

17:54.400 --> 17:56.479
<font color="#FFFF00">I know I don't need to, but that is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">just me,</font>

17:56.480 --> 17:59.399
<font color="#FFFF00">and that is the way I want to be.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I just want you to respect that.</font>

17:59.400 --> 18:02.599
<font color="#00FFFF">When you said you were trying, you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">were standing off today,</font>

18:02.600 --> 18:04.759
<font color="#00FFFF">I was not going to chase you around</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the gaffe,</font>

18:04.760 --> 18:06.999
<font color="#00FFFF">just because you think I was being</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">off with you.</font>

18:07.000 --> 18:09.759
<font color="#FFFF00">No, but what I want to say is, don't</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you then stand off as well.</font>

18:09.760 --> 18:11.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Or we're not going to fucking speak</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to each other.</font>

18:11.840 --> 18:15.159
<font color="#00FFFF">Today, I went about my normal</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">villa life, but you stood off.</font>

18:15.160 --> 18:17.879
<font color="#FFFF00">No, you didn't, cos if you were</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">being your normal villa life,</font>

18:17.880 --> 18:19.639
<font color="#FFFF00">you would have come up to me more.</font>

18:19.640 --> 18:21.719
<font color="#00FFFF">I just didn't think you needed to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">stand off,</font>

18:21.720 --> 18:24.599
<font color="#00FFFF">and you think I needed to talk to</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you. Fair enough. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I told you why.</font>

18:24.600 --> 18:27.679
<font color="#FFFF00">I am trying to respect your fucking</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">situation. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> I understand.</font>

18:27.680 --> 18:30.199
<font color="#00FFFF">I understand your situation.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I've done a fucking mature thing.</font>

18:30.200 --> 18:33.279
<font color="#FFFF00">You have been standoffish with me,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">whether you think it or not.</font>

18:33.280 --> 18:35.559
<font color="#FFFF00">I only started that in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">afternoon.</font>

18:35.560 --> 18:37.319
<font color="#FFFF00">I started it in the afternoon,</font>

18:37.320 --> 18:40.119
<font color="#FFFF00">because you were off with me in the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">morning. Like you always are.</font>

18:40.120 --> 18:42.319
<font color="#FFFF00">You're always in a fucking mood in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the morning.</font>

18:42.320 --> 18:44.239
<font color="#00FFFF">We had a complete difference in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">opinions,</font>

18:44.240 --> 18:47.199
<font color="#00FFFF">and I still have a complete</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">different opinion with Laura.</font>

18:47.200 --> 18:48.919
<font color="#00FFFF">It did get heated.</font>

18:48.920 --> 18:51.239
<font color="#00FFFF">Not to the point that we we're</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">screaming at each other,</font>

18:51.240 --> 18:53.559
<font color="#00FFFF">but to the point where we couldn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">see eye to eye,</font>

18:53.560 --> 18:54.719
<font color="#00FFFF">and I still don't.</font>

18:54.720 --> 18:58.439
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel very responsible for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">everyone's happiness</font>

18:58.440 --> 19:00.199
<font color="#FFFF00">that is around me.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You don't need to be.</font>

19:00.200 --> 19:01.559
<font color="#FFFF00">But I am.</font>

19:01.560 --> 19:04.439
<font color="#00FFFF">And so am I, she was feeling real,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she was like,</font>

19:04.440 --> 19:07.599
<font color="#00FFFF">"Oh, my God, I'm so nervous".</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Please, please, please, please.</font>

19:07.600 --> 19:11.239
<font color="#FFFF00">Honestly, infuriation is brewing in</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my body,</font>

19:11.240 --> 19:13.279
<font color="#FFFF00">if you are actually putting her</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">feelings</font>

19:13.280 --> 19:15.679
<font color="#FFFF00">as a priority before mine right now.</font>

19:15.680 --> 19:17.159
<font color="#00FFFF">When have I just said that?</font>

19:17.160 --> 19:20.839
<font color="#FFFF00">I really don't care if she is upset.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Because I am more upset.</font>

19:20.840 --> 19:23.319
<font color="#FFFF00">It is about me and you before it is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about Ellie.</font>

19:23.320 --> 19:25.399
<font color="#00FFFF">Of course it is. I've not said that,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">have I?</font>

19:25.400 --> 19:28.239
<font color="#00FFFF">I said to her at the table, I'm</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">really happy with Laura.</font>

19:28.240 --> 19:31.239
<font color="#00FFFF">She understands that she is</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">second-best in every single aspect.</font>

19:31.240 --> 19:33.079
<font color="#FFFF00">Second-best, what?</font>

19:33.080 --> 19:35.359
<font color="#00FFFF">In terms of your priorities,</font>

19:35.360 --> 19:37.760
<font color="#00FFFF">she is nowhere near a priority</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">at the moment.</font>

19:39.000 --> 19:40.599
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God.</font>

19:40.600 --> 19:43.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Obviously I didn't want Wes to give</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me space,</font>

19:43.440 --> 19:49.359
<font color="#FFFF00">I thought it was his position to</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">come to me and make me feel secure.</font>

19:49.360 --> 19:50.879
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't care about the date.</font>

19:50.880 --> 19:54.280
<font color="#FFFF00">I just don't like the second</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">guessing.</font>

20:10.000 --> 20:13.319
<font color="#11FF11">Rosie doesn't realise that she is</font>
<font color="#11FF11">just pushing him away more</font>

20:13.320 --> 20:14.999
<font color="#11FF11">by acting the way she is.</font>

20:15.000 --> 20:18.279
<font color="#11FF11">She's giving him drama and grief</font>
<font color="#11FF11">over the fact that I chose him</font>

20:18.280 --> 20:19.719
<font color="#11FF11">to go on a date.</font>

20:19.720 --> 20:23.279
<font color="#11FF11">Like, that's not his fault.</font>

20:23.280 --> 20:26.359
<font color="#11FF11">I walk past her and she has not made</font>
<font color="#11FF11">eye contact.</font>

20:26.360 --> 20:28.520
What I'm trying to say is, like...

20:54.280 --> 20:55.799
<font color="#00FFFF">It was a nice date.</font>

20:55.800 --> 20:58.160
<font color="#00FFFF">I'd be lying if I said I wasn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">excited.</font>

20:59.400 --> 21:00.600
<font color="#00FFFF">Erm, with Ellie.</font>

21:02.920 --> 21:04.880
<font color="#11FF11">I'm gonna sleep with Rosie tonight.</font>

21:07.560 --> 21:09.279
<font color="#FFFF00">Where is she?</font>

21:09.280 --> 21:11.520
<font color="#11FF11">She's outside. I'm not leaving her</font>
<font color="#11FF11">like that.</font>

21:13.840 --> 21:16.559
<font color="#00FFFF">It doesn't matter who walked through</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that front door,</font>

21:16.560 --> 21:19.119
<font color="#00FFFF">this scenario would have happened</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in terms of Rosie.</font>

21:19.120 --> 21:20.879
<font color="#00FFFF">You couldn't have behaved any</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">better.</font>

21:20.880 --> 21:23.799
<font color="#FFFF00">No, you've been lovely, it's not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you, at all.</font>

21:23.800 --> 21:25.920
<font color="#11FF11">Budge up, you silly muffin.</font>

21:28.320 --> 21:29.840
<font color="#00FFFF">You're a good little friend, you.</font>

22:58.480 --> 23:01.559
Coming up, Adam makes his move.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.400
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel like this is really awkward,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but can I touch your boob?</font>

23:05.520 --> 23:07.320
<font color="#FFFF00">Second base there already.</font>

23:17.680 --> 23:20.519
'It's morning, Rosie and Georgia are
sleeping outside

23:20.520 --> 23:22.799
so I can't use
my curtain remote control.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.439
I'll gently rouse them.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.960
Wake up!'

23:58.040 --> 24:01.399
<font color="#00FFFF">The worst thing is, I don't think</font>

24:03.640 --> 24:07.719
<font color="#00FFFF">I genuinely think he's meant it. I</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">yeah, I do want to get to know you,</font>

24:42.640 --> 24:45.199

24:45.200 --> 24:47.679
<font color="#00FFFF">even if there was nothing there</font>

24:47.680 --> 24:50.199

<font color="#00FFFF">someone like that.</font>

24:50.200 --> 24:53.040
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. That's fair enough. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> That's it.</font>

25:00.560 --> 25:04.799
<font color="#FFFF00">I was all right until I just walked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">past Zara sitting on the bed with</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Adam.</font>

25:04.800 --> 25:07.960
<font color="#FFFF00">I can't deal with this.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I really can't.</font>

25:10.040 --> 25:14.159
<font color="#FFFF00">I just feel like so stupid,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like I've been properly used.</font>

25:14.160 --> 25:15.960
<font color="#FFFF00">Really used.</font>

<font color="#00FFFF">Making breakfast for Ellie.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Surprise breakfast.</font>

25:28.760 --> 25:31.679
<font color="#FFFF00">You are so happy,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and I'm so happy for you.</font>

25:31.680 --> 25:34.639
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm quite chirpy this morning.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I have good reason to be.</font>

25:34.640 --> 25:38.519
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you reckon she will like this?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">She will absolutely love this.</font>

25:38.520 --> 25:40.319
<font color="#00FFFF">They will make a chef out of me yet.</font>

25:40.320 --> 25:41.559

25:53.320 --> 25:56.839

<font color="#00FFFF">that lays it on thick or whatever.</font>

25:56.840 --> 25:59.839
<font color="#00FFFF">So I'm just going to see how things</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">pan out, really.</font>

25:59.840 --> 26:01.800
<font color="#11FF11">Right, no-one's naked?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, they are!</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">You need me? Why?</font>

26:14.200 --> 26:16.239
<font color="#00FFFF">I have got the scrambled egg,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mushrooms, bacon.</font>

26:16.240 --> 26:19.479
<font color="#11FF11">That is so cutesy. She will love it.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">She's coming now, actually.</font>

26:19.480 --> 26:20.999
<font color="#00FFFF">Is she? What shall I say?</font>

26:21.000 --> 26:22.799
<font color="#FFFF00">Say, "Darling..."</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">No, don't say that.</font>

26:22.800 --> 26:25.919

26:30.400 --> 26:32.639

26:34.960 --> 26:36.199
(LAUGHTER)

26:36.200 --> 26:38.959
<font color="#FFFF00">It was really, really, really sweet.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm chuffed with that.</font>

26:38.960 --> 26:41.599
<font color="#FFFF00">So what did you think of last night?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you enjoy it?</font>

26:41.600 --> 26:43.959
<font color="#00FFFF">It was great.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It was a nice date, wasn't it?</font>

26:43.960 --> 26:47.399
<font color="#00FFFF">I was quite surprised, when I sat</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">down, I wasn't really sure.</font>

26:47.400 --> 26:50.679
<font color="#00FFFF">I knew how we were,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like we had a bit of a click</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and all that kind of stuff,</font>

26:50.680 --> 26:53.359
<font color="#00FFFF">but I didn't expect you to be as</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">direct as you were.</font>

26:53.360 --> 26:54.599
<font color="#00FFFF">You were, like, boom.</font>

26:54.600 --> 26:58.199
<font color="#00FFFF">I had hardly put the banana split</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on the table, and you were like,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">"What's going on?"</font>

26:58.200 --> 27:02.319
<font color="#FFFF00">The way I see that opportunity was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it was a chance to ask people things</font>

27:02.320 --> 27:06.359
<font color="#FFFF00">that I probably wouldn't have got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an honest answer for</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in a group situation.</font>

27:06.360 --> 27:08.839
<font color="#FFFF00">I feel, like, all giddy and excited</font>

27:08.840 --> 27:11.199
<font color="#FFFF00">because we had a lovely date</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">last night,</font>

27:11.200 --> 27:13.919
<font color="#FFFF00">and then we've woke up</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and had breakfast together.</font>

27:13.920 --> 27:16.199
<font color="#FFFF00">So I am feeling very happy</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about Alex.</font>

27:16.200 --> 27:18.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah. So far, so good.</font>

27:18.560 --> 27:21.679
<font color="#11FF11">Guys, I just want to check</font>
<font color="#11FF11">everything is OK over here.</font>

27:21.680 --> 27:23.439
<font color="#00FFFF">Everything is good.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah.</font>

27:23.440 --> 27:26.359
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, OK. Do you need anything?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">How was your meal?</font>

27:26.360 --> 27:29.519
<font color="#00FFFF">I think you've burnt the bacon a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Burnt the bacon. That's fine.</font>

27:29.520 --> 27:31.919
<font color="#FFFF00">Bless you. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, I've been running</font>
<font color="#11FF11">this place for a while now.</font>

27:31.920 --> 27:35.279
<font color="#11FF11">Give me a shout if you need</font>
<font color="#11FF11">anything. Enjoy your morning.</font>

27:35.280 --> 27:37.959
<font color="#00FFFF">Cheers for coming for breakfast.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Cheers.</font>

27:37.960 --> 27:40.360
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a nice little date.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Thank you for the second date.</font>

27:41.360 --> 27:43.679
<font color="#00FFFF">Only a few days ago, I was nearly</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">going home</font>

27:43.680 --> 27:46.279
<font color="#00FFFF">and staring into the lovely</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">eyes of Caroline Flack,</font>

27:46.280 --> 27:48.119
<font color="#00FFFF">but for the wrong reasons.</font>

27:48.120 --> 27:51.279
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm glad just to still be here.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Now I've got the opportunity</font>

27:51.280 --> 27:54.679
<font color="#00FFFF">and I'm getting to know someone,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we both kind of like each other</font>

27:54.680 --> 27:56.839
<font color="#00FFFF">and there's a lot of features I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like in Ellie.</font>

27:56.840 --> 27:59.239
<font color="#00FFFF">So it's a good position to be in.</font>

Warning: The following scene contains

28:21.560 --> 28:23.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Rosie, is that my hat?</font>

28:23.480 --> 28:26.639
<font color="#11FF11">I dunno, someone just gave it to me.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, it is my hat. </font><font color="#11FF11"> Soz.</font>

<font color="#FFFF00">Do you want to swap with this one?</font>

28:28.560 --> 28:30.719
<font color="#11FF11">Why?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Because this is not my hat.</font>

28:30.720 --> 28:32.079
<font color="#11FF11">If you really want to.</font>

28:32.080 --> 28:34.640
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, that would be fantastic,</font>

28:37.080 --> 28:39.239

28:52.240 --> 28:55.199
<font color="#00FFFF">otherwise I don't think his eyes</font>

look really nice, babe.

<font color="#11FF11">It's not for me, though.</font>

29:19.640 --> 29:21.959

<font color="#11FF11">The only thing I'm upset about is</font>

29:23.520 --> 29:26.639
<font color="#11FF11">that he did what he did in bed with</font>
<font color="#11FF11">me, and then just sacked me off.</font>

29:26.640 --> 29:29.159
<font color="#11FF11">I think that is just a bit</font>
<font color="#11FF11">disgusting, to be honest.</font>

why Laura got upset after he cooked
Ellie a romantic dinner

29:39.160 --> 29:40.559
right under Laura's nose.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.919
Wes, I hear you.
Women are so complicated!

29:43.920 --> 29:47.599
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, Wes, I think it was just one of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">those days, yesterday, weren't it?</font>

29:47.600 --> 29:50.559
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm the 20-year-old and she is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the 29-year-old in the relationship.</font>

29:50.560 --> 29:53.039
<font color="#FFFF00">And I feel like I was being</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a bit more mature. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Mm.</font>

29:53.040 --> 29:56.759
<font color="#00FFFF">It's just mad, innit, how a little</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">bit of miscommunication</font>

29:56.760 --> 29:58.839
<font color="#00FFFF">and a little bit of, just,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what are we doing,</font>

29:58.840 --> 30:01.799
<font color="#00FFFF">if you just miss that part,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">it can be just murder, can't it?</font>

30:01.800 --> 30:05.359
<font color="#00FFFF">It just makes you realise</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that if yous both think,</font>

30:05.360 --> 30:06.999
<font color="#00FFFF">say what are we doing,</font>

30:07.000 --> 30:08.999
<font color="#00FFFF">rather than dragging out all day.</font>

30:09.000 --> 30:11.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Glad you see where I'm coming from.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah.</font>

30:11.440 --> 30:17.080
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you all right? </font><font color="#11FF11"> I'm just going to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">see. (GUFFAWS) Are you OK? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Yep.</font>

30:18.760 --> 30:21.559

<font color="#FFFF00">yesterday.</font>

30:21.560 --> 30:24.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, you learn from arguments, but</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you never forget them.</font>

30:24.440 --> 30:27.479
<font color="#FFFF00">And that's not necessarily a bad</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">thing.</font>

30:27.480 --> 30:29.599
<font color="#FFFF00">You can learn from something, but</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">don't forget it.</font>

30:29.600 --> 30:32.479
<font color="#FFFF00">Because if it keeps repeating, it is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">an ongoing problem,</font>

30:32.480 --> 30:34.719
<font color="#FFFF00">the problem is then going to start</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to fester</font>

30:34.720 --> 30:36.919
<font color="#FFFF00">and start to become a bigger</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">problem.</font>

30:36.920 --> 30:38.519
<font color="#FFFF00">And it's going to be a burden.</font>

30:38.520 --> 30:41.399
<font color="#11FF11">(What are you guys talking about?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Tell me right now.)</font>

30:41.400 --> 30:43.359
<font color="#00FFFF">Huh? No, he was just saying about...</font>

30:43.360 --> 30:44.799
<font color="#11FF11">What?</font>

30:44.800 --> 30:48.399
<font color="#00FFFF">Just arguing and that. He said it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">was just annoying.</font>

30:48.400 --> 30:52.959
<font color="#00FFFF">A little argument and that. It's</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">annoying. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> He's annoyed? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> You're going</font>

30:52.960 --> 30:59.959
<font color="#00FFFF">to be fine. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> We will see, but if he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is sulking today. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> He's not, he's not</font>

30:59.960 --> 31:05.159
<font color="#00FFFF">slagging you off or anything. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have no patience with it. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> He's</font>

31:05.160 --> 31:07.000
<font color="#00FFFF">just being a boy.</font>

31:09.160 --> 31:12.759
<font color="#FFFF00">I can just see us clashing.</font>

31:12.760 --> 31:14.839

<font color="#FFFF00">communication levels and what we</font>

31:22.240 --> 31:26.079
<font color="#FFFF00">think is a priority. I thought we</font>

31:26.080 --> 31:30.119
<font color="#FFFF00">discussing our relationship, clearly</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we're not. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> That was your first</font>

31:30.120 --> 31:36.639
<font color="#00FFFF">little, oh. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> We shall see. I'm not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">going to hold my breath. Today is</font>

31:36.640 --> 31:40.199
<font color="#FFFF00">make or break. If he is sulking and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in a mood and doesn't give me any</font>

31:40.200 --> 31:45.319
<font color="#FFFF00">affection, and isn't making me feel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like a priority, I am not going to</font>

31:45.320 --> 31:48.599
<font color="#FFFF00">waste my time on someone that makes</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">me feel like shit. There are plenty</font>

31:48.600 --> 31:53.320
<font color="#FFFF00">more people I could be spending time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with.</font> You are right, how about Adam?

31:55.200 --> 31:58.960
Based on his track record, he will be
bang up for it by teatime tomorrow.

32:01.160 --> 32:08.479
<font color="#FFFF00">This is really awkward, but can I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">touch your boob? I got to 2nd base,</font>

32:08.480 --> 32:11.600
<font color="#FFFF00">already.</font>

32:12.840 --> 32:18.640
<font color="#11FF11">So I have a question for you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Are things over with you and Rosie?</font>

32:22.560 --> 32:30.319
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes. </font><font color="#11FF11"> OK. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> Things with me and</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Rosie are done. </font><font color="#11FF11"> It's not all because</font>

32:30.320 --> 32:35.479
<font color="#11FF11">of me? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I mean, it is quite because</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of you. I am human, it's not my</font>

32:35.480 --> 32:43.439
<font color="#FFFF00">fault if I fancy you. Just</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">hypothetically. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> What do you think</font>

32:43.440 --> 32:46.640
<font color="#00FFFF">about the Adam, Rosie, Zara love?</font>

32:50.200 --> 32:52.479
<font color="#00FFFF">He has lost his head a bit.</font>

32:52.480 --> 32:55.479
<font color="#FFFF00">He's like a kid in a sweet shop.</font>

32:55.480 --> 32:58.839
<font color="#00FFFF">He needs to try and remember that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">everyone has got</font>

32:58.840 --> 33:03.839
<font color="#00FFFF">feelings. I am a big believer that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you should do what makes you happy</font>

33:03.840 --> 33:08.319
<font color="#00FFFF">in life, but the caveat to that,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the sidenote is that as long as it</font>

33:08.320 --> 33:12.839
<font color="#00FFFF">doesn't hurt anyone else.</font> Alex, I
couldn't agree more. For Rosie, Adam

33:12.840 --> 33:14.360
did not get the memo.

33:22.760 --> 33:30.399
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">You don't deserve this, babe. I know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it's shit, nothing anyone says is</font>

33:30.400 --> 33:34.959
<font color="#FFFF00">gonna help you, but do not blame</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">yourself, he will continue doing</font>

33:34.960 --> 33:41.479
<font color="#FFFF00">this. You have forgiven him and he</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">has done it again. It's not like it</font>

33:41.480 --> 33:45.879
<font color="#FFFF00">is you, it's him. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> It's hard because</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">he is doing all of this and nobody</font>

33:45.880 --> 33:50.919
<font color="#00FFFF">has said anything to him. I came and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">had wanted to find something like</font>

33:50.920 --> 33:54.040
<font color="#00FFFF">you and Jack. </font><font color="#FFFF00"> I am sorry.</font>

33:57.840 --> 34:00.320
<font color="#FFFF00">I wish they could all be like Jack,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I do.</font>

34:02.440 --> 34:07.000
<font color="#FFFF00">Honestly, I know it's shit now,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but karma does come back around.</font>

34:20.679 --> 34:24.998
Still to come, Adam and Rosie face
off. <font color="#FFFF00">You've just nodded at me, don't</font>

34:25.000 --> 34:29.599
<font color="#FFFF00">nod at me. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> If I want to nod at you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you after the way you have treated</font>

34:29.600 --> 34:31.400
<font color="#00FFFF">me, I'll bloody nod at you.</font>

34:38.880 --> 34:42.159
Yesterday evening,
Ellie dated Wes and Alex,

34:42.159 --> 34:43.799
and took a shine to both of them.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.478
Now she's had some thinking time,

34:45.480 --> 34:47.958
Ellie's got
a burning question for Wes.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.998
<font color="#FFFF00">Why don't we do a game of</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">'would you rather?'</font>

34:52.000 --> 34:53.480
<font color="#00FFFF">Go on, then.</font>

34:54.679 --> 34:57.359
<font color="#FFFF00">No, can you start.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I need a bit of time.</font>

34:57.360 --> 34:59.559
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't come here</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with all the game ideas</font>

34:59.560 --> 35:01.439
<font color="#00FFFF">and then no ideas. Come on.</font>

35:01.440 --> 35:03.199
<font color="#00FFFF">Would you rather cats or dogs?</font>

35:03.200 --> 35:06.159
<font color="#FFFF00">That's quite a basic one.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Dogs, always. I hate cats.</font>

35:06.160 --> 35:07.639
<font color="#00FFFF">OK, there you go, bang.</font>

35:07.640 --> 35:09.719
<font color="#FFFF00">Dubai or Thailand?</font>

35:09.720 --> 35:11.919
<font color="#00FFFF">Never been to Thailand,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">never been to Dubai.</font>

35:11.920 --> 35:15.159
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, but one's like...</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Probably Thailand.</font>

35:15.160 --> 35:17.639
<font color="#FFFF00">I think I would say Thailand too.</font>

35:17.640 --> 35:21.199
<font color="#00FFFF">I think Ellie is a really nice girl,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she's obviously an attractive girl.</font>

35:21.200 --> 35:24.919
<font color="#00FFFF">She's very like-minded.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It doesn't necessarily mean</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm trying to jump ship.</font>

35:24.920 --> 35:27.119
<font color="#00FFFF">But I want to find</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the best match for me.</font>

35:27.120 --> 35:29.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I want to go to Dubai for my 21st.</font>

35:29.080 --> 35:31.519
<font color="#00FFFF">When are you 21? </font><font color="#FFFF00"> February.</font>

35:31.520 --> 35:34.719
<font color="#FFFF00">When are you 21? I can't believe</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're the same age as me. </font><font color="#00FFFF"> March.</font>

35:34.720 --> 35:37.119
<font color="#FFFF00">Am I 21 before you?</font>

35:37.120 --> 35:39.639
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I'm still the youngest</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in the fucking villa.</font>

35:39.640 --> 35:41.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Mad. Where's the milk? </font><font color="#00FFFF"> Y'all right?</font>

35:41.840 --> 35:44.639
<font color="#11FF11">There might only be the almond one.</font>

35:44.640 --> 35:47.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll just have almond milk.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I like almond milk.</font>

35:47.080 --> 35:48.559
<font color="#FFFF00">I do like Wes.</font>

35:48.560 --> 35:51.879
<font color="#FFFF00">Last night, he said to me that</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">he did want to get to know me.</font>

35:51.880 --> 35:56.119
<font color="#FFFF00">But I'm not getting the impression</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that Wes's head has been turned yet.</font>

35:56.120 --> 35:58.959
<font color="#FFFF00">But I'm getting the impression</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that it could be.</font>

35:58.960 --> 36:04.720
<font color="#11FF11">It's so obvious to me</font>
<font color="#11FF11">that Ellie fancies Wes.</font>

36:05.720 --> 36:07.839
<font color="#00FFFF">She is full-out with it.</font>

36:07.840 --> 36:09.760
<font color="#11FF11">So, that is fine.</font>

36:12.520 --> 36:14.000
<font color="#11FF11">I do not know.</font>

36:15.360 --> 36:16.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Wes, smashed it.</font>

36:16.840 --> 36:21.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Like pasta with a fillet of salmon</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and King prawns. I was like, oh my</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">God.</font>

36:21.680 --> 36:28.000
<font color="#00FFFF">Look at the face on him, so smug.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That is smug as hell.</font>

36:29.160 --> 36:31.039
<font color="#11FF11">From what West told me the other</font>
<font color="#11FF11">day,</font>

36:31.040 --> 36:34.279
<font color="#11FF11">he was not leading her on, so why</font>
<font color="#11FF11">try and push it?</font>

36:34.280 --> 36:36.159
<font color="#11FF11">Why be friends with me?</font>

36:36.160 --> 36:40.959
<font color="#11FF11">She is constantly trying to get to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">him. She was saying to him,</font>

36:40.960 --> 36:44.479
<font color="#11FF11">I can't believe we're both 20.</font>

36:44.480 --> 36:46.920
<font color="#11FF11">They really have something in</font>
<font color="#11FF11">common.</font>

36:48.400 --> 36:50.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Nobody likes the girl that is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">flirting</font>

36:50.440 --> 36:52.159
<font color="#FFFF00">with the guy that you are seeing.</font>

36:52.160 --> 36:54.199
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm just wondering what she's going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to do</font>

36:54.200 --> 36:56.719
<font color="#FFFF00">and how far she can get before I</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">snap.</font>

36:56.720 --> 37:02.080
<font color="#FFFF00">Step away from the man, the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">muscles, do not touch him.</font>

37:03.120 --> 37:04.959
<font color="#00FFFF">What's your favourite then?</font>

37:04.960 --> 37:08.919
<font color="#11FF11">Well I think the main, just because</font>
<font color="#11FF11">anybody can make a banana split.</font>

37:08.920 --> 37:11.639
<font color="#11FF11">Effort-wise, it will be Wes.</font>

37:11.640 --> 37:14.519
<font color="#11FF11">On taste, I would always pick</font>
<font color="#11FF11">desert.</font>

37:14.520 --> 37:16.559
<font color="#00FFFF">You don't get an award, mate.</font>

37:16.560 --> 37:18.920
<font color="#00FFFF">For effort on the lettuce.</font>

37:24.200 --> 37:25.919
<font color="#00FFFF">Oi! What is that?</font>

37:25.920 --> 37:27.360
<font color="#00FFFF">Piss off.</font>

37:29.040 --> 37:31.399
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not used.</font>

37:31.400 --> 37:35.759
<font color="#11FF11">I definitely think that when me and</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Wes are having a conversation, there</font>

37:35.760 --> 37:40.879
<font color="#11FF11">is definitely a presence, eyes</font>
<font color="#11FF11">burning on the back of your head.</font>

37:40.880 --> 37:43.399
<font color="#11FF11">Yes, everyone needs to chill out.</font>

37:43.400 --> 37:44.799
<font color="#00FFFF">Anybody want cream?</font>

37:44.800 --> 37:46.080
No.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.439
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey baby!</font>

37:51.440 --> 37:54.120
<font color="#11FF11">I bet youse are enjoying that</font>
<font color="#11FF11">a wee bit too much.</font>

37:56.760 --> 37:58.840
<font color="#11FF11">Babe, I didn't mean that.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I promise you.</font>

38:00.320 --> 38:02.759
<font color="#FFFF00">No, the fucking shit</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">is burning my eyes.</font>

38:02.760 --> 38:04.799
<font color="#11FF11">Do you want me to lick your eyeball?</font>

38:04.800 --> 38:08.799
<font color="#00FFFF">It was obvious what Laura is doing.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">It was obviously not just</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a bit of fun.</font>

38:08.800 --> 38:10.439
<font color="#00FFFF">She has definitely done it to sort</font>

38:10.440 --> 38:14.079
<font color="#00FFFF">of interrupt the conversations</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">between me, Ellie and the lads.</font>

38:14.080 --> 38:15.799
<font color="#00FFFF">She did not want that to happen.</font>

38:15.800 --> 38:17.839
<font color="#00FFFF">I think that is the first of many</font>

38:17.840 --> 38:20.240
<font color="#00FFFF">things she's probably going to do</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">as a roadblock.</font>

38:27.880 --> 38:32.519
Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to
present a Love Island first.

38:32.520 --> 38:36.799
Adam in bed with a woman he is not
try to crack on with.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.839
<font color="#FFFF00">Which one would you prefer?</font>

38:38.840 --> 38:41.479
<font color="#11FF11">I don't know because I feel after</font>
<font color="#11FF11">last night,</font>

38:41.480 --> 38:43.359
<font color="#11FF11">I have nothing else to say.</font>

38:43.360 --> 38:44.799
<font color="#11FF11">Nothing happened.</font>

38:44.800 --> 38:47.679
<font color="#11FF11">Last night was a bit like first</font>
<font color="#11FF11">impressions,</font>

38:47.680 --> 38:49.839
<font color="#11FF11">to me of proper first impressions.</font>

38:49.840 --> 38:52.079
<font color="#FFFF00">I actually think</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that Wes wants to get</font>

38:52.080 --> 38:54.079
<font color="#FFFF00">on with you, I think he is scared.</font>

38:54.080 --> 38:56.480
<font color="#FFFF00">I think he feels like really scared.</font>

38:59.560 --> 39:02.960
<font color="#FFFF00">You're a lot closer to his age,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it is better for him.</font>

39:04.480 --> 39:08.039
<font color="#FFFF00">Who do you think you are more</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">attracted to?</font>

39:08.040 --> 39:12.759
<font color="#11FF11">If I had to go purely on looks,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">whereas Wes will be the full</font>
<font color="#11FF11">package,</font>

39:12.760 --> 39:15.640
<font color="#11FF11">then Alex, and it is not about looks</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for me at all.</font>

39:26.640 --> 39:30.799
<font color="#00FFFF">I just think you have got to be so</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">cold to do that in front of</font>

39:30.800 --> 39:33.440
<font color="#00FFFF">somebody when you know she has been</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">upset all day.</font>

39:34.880 --> 39:37.080
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm hurting, like I'm actually</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">hurting.</font>

39:40.680 --> 39:43.640
<font color="#11FF11">We shall have to see, my friend.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We will see.</font>

39:48.120 --> 39:49.559
<font color="#FFFF00">Stop fake yawning.</font>

39:49.560 --> 39:51.679
<font color="#FFFF00">I think Ellie fancies you.</font>

39:51.680 --> 39:54.879
Well Wes has that something that
other men don't.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.479
His mom's secret recipe.

39:57.480 --> 40:01.559
Up on the terrace, Rosie is cooking
up a battle plan.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.359
<font color="#FFFF00">What are you gonna say tonight?</font>

40:03.360 --> 40:07.679
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm just gonna close this chapter.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I do need closure.</font>

40:07.680 --> 40:11.759
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm never can have anything real</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with him, it is done.</font>

40:11.760 --> 40:13.559
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, so what about Zara?</font>

40:13.560 --> 40:16.599
<font color="#00FFFF">I think the way she has handled it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">has been very disrespectful.</font>

40:16.600 --> 40:19.959
<font color="#00FFFF">She would have done it completely</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">differently.</font>

40:19.960 --> 40:23.479
<font color="#00FFFF">She came in here</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wanting to take Adam, she succeeded.</font>

40:23.480 --> 40:25.239
<font color="#00FFFF">Best of luck to her.</font>

40:25.240 --> 40:29.279
{\an1}<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not have anything to do with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that, with either of them. I'm done.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Good for you.</font>

40:29.280 --> 40:32.640
<font color="#11FF11">You know what you're going to</font>
<font color="#11FF11">say, say that as a strong woman.</font>

40:34.480 --> 40:37.079
<font color="#00FFFF">I just want him to see that he has</font>

40:37.080 --> 40:39.639
<font color="#00FFFF">actually hurt someone by the way he</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">is being.</font>

40:39.640 --> 40:42.599
<font color="#FFFF00">You go in and hand it in.</font>

40:42.600 --> 40:44.919
<font color="#00FFFF">But I'm not the kind of girl who</font>

40:44.920 --> 40:47.439
<font color="#00FFFF">will let someone do that to me over</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and over again.</font>

40:47.440 --> 40:48.840
<font color="#FFFF00">Ar you ready, honey?</font>

41:00.000 --> 41:03.760
<font color="#00FFFF">I just want to close the Rosie and</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Adam chapter today, and move on.</font>

41:10.080 --> 41:12.439
<font color="#11FF11">Is this the worst tension it has</font>
<font color="#11FF11">been?</font>

41:12.440 --> 41:16.079
<font color="#FFFF00">By a million percent.</font>

41:16.080 --> 41:17.679
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, my God!</font>

41:17.680 --> 41:19.879
<font color="#00FFFF">Why do I feel like I'm going for a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">boxing match</font>

41:19.880 --> 41:21.560
<font color="#00FFFF">whenever I come out here?</font>

41:29.200 --> 41:31.120
<font color="#11FF11">OK, she is coming out now.</font>

41:34.000 --> 41:35.640
<font color="#00FFFF">She's walking as sassy as fuck.</font>

41:39.040 --> 41:41.759
<font color="#11FF11">Good luck. You're going to need it.</font>

41:41.760 --> 41:42.960
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't lose your head.</font>

41:47.240 --> 41:49.999
<font color="#FFFF00">What was that, a nod?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, you coming?</font>

41:50.000 --> 41:53.960
<font color="#FFFF00">That is just you all over.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Yes, it is always me.</font>

42:02.120 --> 42:04.719
<font color="#00FFFF">That's more than what you've given</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">me in two days, babe.</font>

42:04.720 --> 42:06.200
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's be honest.</font>

42:07.480 --> 42:09.040
<font color="#00FFFF">(SIGH)</font>

42:11.040 --> 42:12.920
<font color="#00FFFF">Why are you looking at me like that?</font>

42:15.320 --> 42:18.879
<font color="#00FFFF">You think this is all funny, like a</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">big game to you.</font>

42:18.880 --> 42:21.560
<font color="#FFFF00">I just think the way you react is</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">funny.</font>

42:23.120 --> 42:25.439
<font color="#00FFFF">You literally had no shame all day</font>

42:25.440 --> 42:28.399
<font color="#00FFFF">and did everything in front of my</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">face.</font>

42:28.400 --> 42:30.519
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't think you have any idea how</font>

42:30.520 --> 42:33.040
<font color="#00FFFF">much you actually hurt me and really</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">upset me.</font>

42:34.720 --> 42:37.599
<font color="#00FFFF">The worst thing is that I don't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">think you actually care.</font>

42:37.600 --> 42:39.920
<font color="#00FFFF">You are literally like stone.</font>

42:40.920 --> 42:44.080
<font color="#00FFFF">I shared I night with you that I</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">wouldn't share with other people.</font>

42:45.880 --> 42:49.959
<font color="#00FFFF">You literally had what you wanted</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and ditched me.</font>

42:49.960 --> 42:52.759
<font color="#00FFFF">It's always been a very clever game</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with you.</font>

42:52.760 --> 42:56.200
{\an1}<font color="#FFFF00">The fact that you came over then</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">said right, I want to speak to you.</font>

42:58.400 --> 43:00.519
<font color="#00FFFF">I think I've got every right</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to be arsey with you</font>

43:00.520 --> 43:03.879
<font color="#00FFFF">when you have spent two days</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">over a girl you've known for five</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">minutes.</font>

43:03.880 --> 43:06.800
<font color="#FFFF00">You have just nodded at me. Do not</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">fucking nod at me.</font>

43:08.440 --> 43:11.479
<font color="#00FFFF">You haven't spoken to me all day.</font>

43:11.480 --> 43:13.279
<font color="#00FFFF">You spent 10 days with me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and then you</font>

43:13.280 --> 43:15.839
<font color="#00FFFF">say don't nod at me like you're</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the king of the world.</font>

43:15.840 --> 43:17.199
<font color="#00FFFF">If I want to nod at you</font>

43:17.200 --> 43:20.159
<font color="#00FFFF">u after the way you treated me,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll bloody nod at you.</font>

43:20.160 --> 43:22.119
<font color="#00FFFF">You cannot treat girls like that.</font>

43:22.120 --> 43:25.439
<font color="#00FFFF">You will never be happy because</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you're constantly searching for</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">more.</font>

43:25.440 --> 43:28.439
<font color="#00FFFF">You trick girls into thinking that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you are into a serious relationship,</font>

43:28.440 --> 43:30.879
<font color="#00FFFF">you're not, you're in here to rack</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">up your numbers, Adam.</font>

43:30.880 --> 43:34.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Because you know what, you made me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">believe that we really had</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">something.</font>

43:38.360 --> 43:39.639
<font color="#00FFFF">We had things in common.</font>

43:39.640 --> 43:43.519
<font color="#00FFFF">We were building and building,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and you can't say we weren't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because we were.</font>

43:43.520 --> 43:47.960
<font color="#00FFFF">And you have literally been with</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a girl that you do not know.</font>

43:51.120 --> 43:54.319
<font color="#00FFFF">I would never ever, ever, make</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">anyone feel</font>

43:54.320 --> 43:57.559
<font color="#00FFFF">like crap because that is not me.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't do it but you believed</font>

43:57.560 --> 44:00.799
{\an1}<font color="#00FFFF">a girl you knew for five minutes</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">over someone you spent 10 days with.</font>

44:00.800 --> 44:04.799
<font color="#00FFFF">Someone who shares things that she</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">does not share with a lot of people.</font>

44:04.800 --> 44:08.119
{\an1}<font color="#00FFFF">Because I trusted you and I never</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">thought you would hurt me like this.</font>

44:08.120 --> 44:09.959
<font color="#00FFFF">I do not think</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">you would do that to me.</font>

44:09.960 --> 44:12.120
<font color="#00FFFF">You just threw it all away.</font>

44:17.760 --> 44:21.799
<font color="#00FFFF">As far as I'm concerned, if you want</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to go with her, that is fine.</font>

44:21.800 --> 44:23.359
<font color="#00FFFF">I will be happy for you.</font>

44:23.360 --> 44:26.199
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm here to find a boy that I can</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">take home to mum and dad.</font>

44:26.200 --> 44:28.679
<font color="#00FFFF">I have genuinely come in here</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to find something real.</font>

44:28.680 --> 44:30.440
<font color="#00FFFF">I do not think you have.</font>

44:32.880 --> 44:35.639
<font color="#00FFFF">It wasn't me that pushed Zara away,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she did not want</font>

44:35.640 --> 44:37.799
<font color="#00FFFF">to be my friend because</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">she wanted you.</font>

44:37.800 --> 44:40.799
<font color="#FFFF00">You have not pushed Zara away.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You have pushed me away.</font>

44:40.800 --> 44:43.359
<font color="#00FFFF">I've not done anything wrong.</font>

44:43.360 --> 44:45.400
<font color="#00FFFF">You made a decision</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">when she walked in.</font>

44:47.920 --> 44:51.759
<font color="#00FFFF">You have got a girl actually</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">speaking to you, telling you that</font>

44:51.760 --> 44:56.079
<font color="#00FFFF">you actually hurt her and she hasn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">done anything wrong.</font>

44:56.080 --> 44:57.880
<font color="#00FFFF">Why are you rolling your eyes?</font>

44:59.760 --> 45:02.639
<font color="#00FFFF">You've literally broke my heart</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">today</font>

45:02.640 --> 45:07.199
<font color="#00FFFF">and you sit here now and you're</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">still cocky and smug about it.</font>

45:07.200 --> 45:10.559
<font color="#00FFFF">And yes, if I'm the person</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">in the wrong,</font>

45:10.560 --> 45:15.479
<font color="#00FFFF">you really need to look at it.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm sorry, but I've really tried.</font>

45:15.480 --> 45:18.800
<font color="#00FFFF">But I cannot do this.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Whatever game you are playing.</font>

45:21.000 --> 45:23.919
<font color="#00FFFF">I can't talk to you when you've got</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a face like that.</font>

45:23.920 --> 45:28.440
<font color="#00FFFF">Go and enjoy the next bombshell that</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">comes in, because this one is done.</font>

45:35.520 --> 45:48.839
<font color="#00FFFF">He is a vile.</font>

45:48.840 --> 45:53.079
In the villa, it is getting tougher
by the minute.

45:53.080 --> 45:56.159
<font color="#00FFFF">I am the second girl, Megan was the</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">third, you are the fourth. And it</font>

45:56.160 --> 45:58.159
<font color="#00FFFF">has been two weeks. Be careful.</font>

45:58.160 --> 46:00.680
<font color="#FFFF00">We are not boyfriend and girlfriend.</font>

46:02.560 --> 46:04.200
<font color="#00FFFF">I hate this place.</font>
