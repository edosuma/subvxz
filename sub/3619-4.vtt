All set.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.967
The kids are asleep.

00:11.141 --> 00:13.274
What about Phoebe
and Paige?

00:13.448 --> 00:15.450
You want me to put
them to bed, too?

00:16.842 --> 00:19.367
Paige is at school, and...

00:19.541 --> 00:20.803
Phoebe went
to the movies.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.587
Really-- on a date?

00:22.761 --> 00:25.851
No, with a friend.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.070
Well, that's good.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.680
At least she's
taking advantage

00:28.854 --> 00:30.334
of not having to be
at work in the morning.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.989
That's, that's good.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.425
You're stalling.

00:34.599 --> 00:37.124
But don't make it
a bigger deal than it is.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.429
You're just one Elder
calling on another

00:38.603 --> 00:39.648
to see if you can help.

00:39.822 --> 00:42.129
But what if they found out?

00:42.303 --> 00:43.260
They haven't.

00:43.434 --> 00:44.696
We already talked about this.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.611
Look, you're not gonna
be able to move on

00:46.785 --> 00:48.483
if you don't let go of the past.

00:48.657 --> 00:51.486
That's the reason
you're doing this, remember?

00:51.660 --> 00:52.443
What?

00:52.617 --> 00:53.792
You'll think I'm crazy.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.707
I already think you're crazy.

00:58.536 --> 00:59.450
What is it?

00:59.624 --> 01:03.193
It's just...

01:03.367 --> 01:06.109
I've been seeing things lately.

01:06.283 --> 01:07.632
Hearing voices

01:07.806 --> 01:10.505
that make me feel
like I can't come back

01:10.679 --> 01:12.768
and I don't know if they're real
or not, but they...

01:12.942 --> 01:14.509
seem like they are.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.902
Well, that's probably
just self-doubt. Ignore it.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.469
Or a guilty conscience.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.689
But you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.604
What happened was
out of your control.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.997
All that matters
is what happens next.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.044
So, go play nice
with the other Elders.

01:40.883 --> 01:43.842
Please let him get through this.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.239
Hello, Leo.

01:49.413 --> 01:50.980
Hey.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.199
Thanks for coming.

01:52.373 --> 01:53.504
How have you been?

01:53.678 --> 01:54.592
Good.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.639
Great.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.945
Actually, that's sort of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.122
We can't let you back up there

02:02.296 --> 02:03.340
if that's
what you want.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.951
No. Uh, I understand.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.346
So...

02:09.520 --> 02:12.044
any word on who killed Zola yet?

02:12.219 --> 02:13.698
No.

02:13.872 --> 02:14.960
But we'll find who did it.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.353
We have to.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.141
So... what can I help youwith?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.012
Well, actually,

02:23.186 --> 02:24.753
I was hoping
to help you.

02:24.927 --> 02:26.494
I mean, you know, as an Elder.

02:26.668 --> 02:27.799
I don't quite follow.

02:27.973 --> 02:28.974
Well, I...

02:29.149 --> 02:31.107
want to do what I used to do--

02:31.281 --> 02:32.108
before Gideon.

02:32.282 --> 02:33.544
I'm just

02:33.718 --> 02:35.198

02:35.372 --> 02:39.202
A couple of whitelighters
have lost track

02:39.376 --> 02:41.073
of their
charges recently.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.163
Two in the last three nights.
It may be nothing.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.600
Charges? You mean
whitelighters-to-be? Or witches?

02:45.774 --> 02:47.297
Witches.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.560
Just practitioners.
Not powerful, but still...

02:49.734 --> 02:51.301
I'll get the sisters
right on it.

02:51.475 --> 02:52.302
Good.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.130
Keep me posted.

can't trust him.

You know, I don't understand
why I can't find them.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.607
I tried sensing them,
I tried summoning them,

05:46.781 --> 05:47.825
I tried scrying for them.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.611

Or maybe there's
nothing to overlook.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.051
I mean, let's face it,
like the Elder said,

05:56.225 --> 05:57.444
this could be nothing.

05:57.618 --> 05:58.967
They're still missing,
aren't they?

Still, maybe you're
trying too hard.

Piper, he wants me to do this.

to me unless it was something.

Okay, so...

06:07.236 --> 06:08.716

the common denominators?

06:10.631 --> 06:12.850
Well, besides the fact
that they're witches,

06:13.024 --> 06:15.810
um, the fog rolled in
just before they disappeared.

rolled in, it's San Francisco.

taking Wyatt to the nursery--
he's fine, I might add--

06:38.398 --> 06:41.749

and said, "Excuse me."

Alert the authorities.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.927
You didn't
let me finish.

since I took over Magic School.

06:55.763 --> 06:56.938

You're damn right,
I'm obsessing.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.158

this instead:

around the city

when the fog
rolls in.

07:07.992 --> 07:09.646
That's what you've got?

07:09.820 --> 07:11.039
That's all the Elders know.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.563
We haven't been able
to find out much else.

07:13.737 --> 07:14.782
You spoke to the Elders?

07:14.956 --> 07:16.218
Yes.

07:16.392 --> 07:17.785
And I promised
we'd help.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.091
Good for you.

07:20.265 --> 07:22.398
You know, this actually

I'm gonna go
scry for them.

We already tried that,
it didn't work.

Too much time has passed
since the last one disappeared.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.369
Okay, why don't
we try to find out

07:37.544 --> 07:39.502
if anyone has disappeared
more recently?

07:39.676 --> 07:41.286
I'm sure the Elders
would have told me.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.550
Not if they don't
know about it yet.

07:43.724 --> 07:45.377
Hmm. Well, what
about Morris?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.597
I'm sure he can ask
Missing Persons.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.426
Yeah, go ahead,
you can go ask him.

sample back east

08:36.298 --> 08:37.560

you mean you can't find it?

see us, right?

what it is,

knocked out.

Okay, wow,
that's better.

the press about?

09:31.440 --> 09:32.920

09:33.094 --> 09:34.791

and we need to find them.

want to help Sheridan

09:43.104 --> 09:44.758
hang us out to dry,
that's your business.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.716

about that.

help us or not?

hurry up and

Don't you just love clichés?

11:22.072 --> 11:23.987
Well, don't just
stand there,

11:24.161 --> 11:25.641
you fool. Bring her closer.

11:28.775 --> 11:29.645
[sniffing]

11:29.819 --> 11:32.430
Ahh. The stench of witch.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.084
I'd know that
anywhere.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.564
What do you want?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.305
I want you to die...

11:37.479 --> 11:39.263
but not too fast.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.138
[gasps]

11:44.312 --> 11:47.141
One of your kind cursed me with
this a very long time ago.

11:47.315 --> 11:48.577
Of course,

11:48.751 --> 11:51.101
then I used it
to cut her heart out.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.452
Aah!

11:54.626 --> 11:55.584
Take her away.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.717
But what about the Charmed Ones?

11:57.891 --> 11:59.849
All good things
to those who wait.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.198
Do as I say

12:01.372 --> 12:02.896
or I'll have you in irons.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.114
[squawks]

12:05.246 --> 12:06.464
Oh.

12:14.559 --> 12:15.386
Knock, knock.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.910
Phoebe.

12:17.084 --> 12:18.085
Hey, uh,

12:18.259 --> 12:19.303
what are you doing here?

12:19.477 --> 12:21.262
I'm just returning
your phone call.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.526
Wow, returning
my call, um...

12:24.700 --> 12:27.964
most people return
phone calls with, uh...

12:28.138 --> 12:29.661
I don't know,
phone calls?

12:29.836 --> 12:32.621
Yeah, well, I kind of needed
to get out of the house.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.145
We're experiencing
a bit of a pest problem.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.756
Well, is it serious?

12:36.930 --> 12:38.061
Too soon to tell.

12:39.454 --> 12:40.716
So what did you call about?

12:40.890 --> 12:42.239
Well, it was...

12:42.413 --> 12:44.285
a little timely.
I had to make a decision but...

12:44.459 --> 12:46.374
you did give me free reign,
didn't you?

12:46.548 --> 12:48.419
Yes, absolutely.

12:48.593 --> 12:51.509
I mean, how else would
I be enjoying my sabbatical,

12:51.683 --> 12:53.598
right?
Exactly.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.081
So that's it,

12:58.255 --> 12:59.735
huh?
Nothing else

12:59.909 --> 13:01.476
you needed to talk to me about?

13:01.650 --> 13:03.652
Um... nope, I-I can't
think of anything.

13:03.826 --> 13:04.914
Ask me...
nothing?

13:05.088 --> 13:06.568
Nah.

13:06.742 --> 13:07.874
Okay.

13:09.701 --> 13:10.528
Uh, wait, there was...

13:10.702 --> 13:12.356
one thing,

13:12.530 --> 13:14.054
actually. I was, uh...
I was looking through

13:14.228 --> 13:15.751
some of your notes and ideas
last week,

13:15.925 --> 13:17.361
and I found something about

13:17.535 --> 13:18.972
a contest?

13:19.146 --> 13:20.538
Oh, the "Win a Date
with Phoebe" contest.

13:20.712 --> 13:21.713
Yeah, that was Elise's idea.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.541
Yeah, I think it's a great idea.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.369
I mean, readers
love to be talked

13:25.543 --> 13:27.502
to and not down to. I think
going on a date gives you

13:27.676 --> 13:28.938
a chance to make them feel like
you're...

13:29.112 --> 13:30.244
you're really a part
of their lives.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.636
Really?
You know, it's

13:31.811 --> 13:32.899
it's a great PR move.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.726
Uh... [stammers]I mean I really

13:34.901 --> 13:36.424
I would love to leave you
with more readers than,

13:36.598 --> 13:37.599
than you had when I came.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.340
That's really sweet, Leslie.

13:39.514 --> 13:40.602
Uh...

13:40.776 --> 13:42.952
but I think I'm taking a break

13:43.126 --> 13:44.345
from the dating world, as well.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.216
Besides,

13:46.390 --> 13:48.001
you never know who's going
to win a contest like that.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.393
Well, I would win it.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.744
I mean... just to
protect you, of course.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.572
Are you asking me out on a date?

13:54.746 --> 13:57.097
Strictly professional.

13:57.271 --> 13:58.750
Look, how

13:58.925 --> 13:59.795
about this? We go tonight,
we get it over with.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.405
"Get it over with?"

14:01.579 --> 14:02.972
Well, yeah,
so we don't infringe on

14:03.146 --> 14:04.104
your life away
from here anymore

14:04.278 --> 14:05.714
than we already have.
Okay.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.629
Well, call me stupid, but...

14:07.803 --> 14:09.239
shouldn't you actually run

14:09.413 --> 14:10.588
the contest
in the paper

14:10.762 --> 14:12.590
before you decide who wins it?Oh,

14:12.764 --> 14:14.636
details... I'll just...
I'll hold the copy on the date

14:14.810 --> 14:15.680
and-and print it afterwards.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.378
So what do you say?

14:17.552 --> 14:18.553
Maxine's, 8:00?

14:18.727 --> 14:20.033
Hmm...

14:21.251 --> 14:23.645
All right. 8:00.

14:39.704 --> 14:40.662
Can I help you?

14:40.836 --> 14:42.098
Hi, I'm Paige Matthews.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.187
I'm here about, uh,
Brenda Castillo?

14:44.361 --> 14:45.841
Are you from the police?

14:46.015 --> 14:48.452
No, I'm just somebody
who's concerned

14:48.626 --> 14:49.540
about her.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.281
I'm sorry.

14:51.455 --> 14:54.806
No, please... Is Brenda
a witch, by any chance?

14:54.981 --> 14:56.983
Because if she is, I think
I can help find her.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.290
Come in.

15:04.294 --> 15:06.818
Are you one, too?

15:06.993 --> 15:08.864
A witch, I mean?

15:09.038 --> 15:11.127
Yeah, you?

15:11.301 --> 15:12.433
Oh, no.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.609
No, that's Brenda's thing.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.916
Oh, you don't believe
in witchcraft?

15:17.090 --> 15:18.830
I will if it'll
help find her.

15:19.005 --> 15:21.094
She wouldn't just not
come home, you know.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.486
She never has.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.793
But the police, they
won't do a thing.

15:24.967 --> 15:28.144
Yeah, it's the whole
24-hour deal, right?

15:29.972 --> 15:31.843
You guys seem pretty close.
Are you sisters,

15:32.018 --> 15:32.932
roommates?

15:33.106 --> 15:36.805
Um... no, partners.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.807
That's another
reason the police

15:38.981 --> 15:40.200
won't do anything, you know,

15:40.374 --> 15:42.593
they think it's just
a lover's quarrel

15:42.767 --> 15:44.334
or something. Like it's

15:44.508 --> 15:45.814
just a big joke.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.642
I know, it's not a joke.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.470
Look, if I'm going
to find her,

15:49.644 --> 15:52.429
I'm going to need something,
anything to go off of.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.736
Maybe this'll help.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.478
I found it

15:57.652 --> 16:00.698
on the floor when I got home,
I'd never seen it before.

16:04.180 --> 16:06.008
What do you
think it means?

16:16.410 --> 16:18.238
Brenda.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.023
Brenda.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.507
Brenda.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.081
Go away. Hurry.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.702
CAPTAIN CUTTING:
Took you long
enough, dearie.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.486
We've been waiting for you.

16:49.660 --> 16:50.661
[squawks]

16:55.666 --> 16:58.408
CAPTAIN CUTTING:
You wouldn't just orb
out and leave an innocent

16:58.582 --> 16:59.670
stranded, would you, witch?

16:59.844 --> 17:01.281
You look like

17:01.455 --> 17:02.891
you've been out to sea
for quite some time.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.588
Nearly 300 years.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.242
In a place beyond

17:06.416 --> 17:08.157
time and space.

17:08.331 --> 17:11.291
Only when the mystical fog rolls
in do we get a chance to come

17:11.465 --> 17:14.076
and play in fair port
cities like your own.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.252
You see, I would
have chosen London.

17:16.426 --> 17:18.080
I did, they didn't have
what I want.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.603
And what's that?

17:19.777 --> 17:21.736
You... and your sisters.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.477
Only you

17:23.651 --> 17:25.783
can get me the treasure
I so desire.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.655
Oh, I guess I forgot
where I buried it.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.309
You're very quick
with the tongue.

17:29.483 --> 17:30.788
Let me ask you,

17:30.962 --> 17:33.008
when the gathering
storm arrives here,

17:33.182 --> 17:34.879
will you be
making jokes then, huh?

17:35.054 --> 17:39.623
Gathering storm, I'm so sorry,
I don't speak pirate, matey.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.452
This is not pirate lore,
this is something very real...

17:42.626 --> 17:44.106
and very dangerous.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.934
And I don't intend

17:46.108 --> 17:47.762
to be stuck here
when it arrives.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.070
Sword.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.077
[squawks]

17:58.251 --> 17:59.208
REZNOR:
Excuse me.

17:59.382 --> 18:02.081
Would you mind?

18:03.691 --> 18:04.648
[pirates laugh]

18:04.822 --> 18:06.476
Okay, you're supposed to be...

18:06.650 --> 18:07.564
Dead.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.784
He wishes.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.309
That's going to leave a mark.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.791
You let her escape.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.706
I let her go.
She's no good to us alone.

18:18.880 --> 18:19.794
But her sisters...

18:19.968 --> 18:21.230
Will come. When they realize

18:21.404 --> 18:22.666
they've got no choice.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.886
Are you questioning
me, first mate?

18:25.060 --> 18:26.409
Remember your oath?

18:26.583 --> 18:29.586
You do as I say, when I say it.
Understand?

18:29.760 --> 18:33.808
You all will, or this hell
we're in will never end.

18:36.202 --> 18:37.681
What about the golden chalice?

18:37.855 --> 18:39.466
[pirates muttering]

18:39.640 --> 18:40.989
[squawks]
We've had trouble

18:41.163 --> 18:42.730
procuring it, sir.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.732
There may be another way.

18:44.906 --> 18:46.690
For now, make yourselves scarce.

18:46.864 --> 18:50.607
We want the witches
to rescue her...

18:50.781 --> 18:52.870
remember.
Aye... Aye.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.490
All right, you need to
slow down and relax.

19:03.664 --> 19:07.146
Okay, I can't because
we need to find Brenda.

19:07.320 --> 19:11.019
Look, whatever their angle is,
whatever the reason is,

19:11.193 --> 19:12.890
we can't go in there blind
like you did,

19:13.064 --> 19:14.805
which, I may add,
was very dangerous.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.765
All I did was scry for her
with the coin; is that so bad?

19:17.939 --> 19:19.984
LEO:
And look where
it got you.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.248
If you go back in again, you
could be walking the plank.PAIGE: Cute.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.989
Strangely,
there is nothing in here

19:25.164 --> 19:26.034
about pirates.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.166
Leo, do you know anything?

19:27.340 --> 19:28.254
About pirates?

19:28.428 --> 19:30.038
A little
before my time.

19:30.212 --> 19:33.084
Are you sure there's nothing
in here?

19:33.259 --> 19:34.434
You need glasses there, ma'am?

19:34.608 --> 19:36.784
No, I'm just a little woozy.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.002
Which is why we need to

19:38.177 --> 19:38.829
know what
we're up
against.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.309
Yeah, well, okay.

19:40.483 --> 19:41.832
Then, we need to go
to Magic School

19:42.006 --> 19:43.225
since they're obviously
not of this time.

19:43.399 --> 19:44.531
PHOEBE:
Who's not?

19:44.705 --> 19:47.447
PIPER:
Oh, just,
you know, pirates.

19:47.621 --> 19:48.970
Pirates, like hot
Johnny Depp pirates?

19:49.144 --> 19:51.059
Yeah, probably not.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.756
PIPER:
Tell her, Paige.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.193
Tell her what? Why we left
an innocent stranded?

19:54.367 --> 19:55.281
PIPER:
No...

19:55.455 --> 19:57.587
why we almost lost a sister.

19:58.719 --> 20:00.764
If they had wanted to kill me,
they would have.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.418
They're obviously
after something else.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.028
PIPER:
Yeah,

20:04.203 --> 20:05.552
like wanting
to kill all of us.

20:06.770 --> 20:07.728
Okay, what's going on, you two?

20:07.902 --> 20:09.033
We'll catch you up

20:09.208 --> 20:10.339
on the way to Magic School.
Right now,

20:10.513 --> 20:11.819
we need to go brush up

20:11.993 --> 20:13.124
on our pirate lore.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.517
Can you watch the kids?LEO:
Yeah,

20:14.691 --> 20:15.997
but...PIPER:
No, no.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.781
You already did your part,
now let us do ours.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.348
PHOEBE:
Okay, what if we
don't find anything?

20:19.522 --> 20:21.481
I mean, pirates aren't
known to be magical.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.396
Do you have
a better idea?
PHOEBE:
Actually,

20:23.570 --> 20:25.267
yes.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.008
I might.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.792
Pirate movies?
You want to know
about pirate movies?

20:28.966 --> 20:30.620
Yeah, I do. Just tell me
everything you know.

20:30.794 --> 20:31.795
I thought you were
on sabbatical.

20:31.969 --> 20:32.883
It's not for my column,

20:33.057 --> 20:34.015
it's personal.

20:34.189 --> 20:35.451
Okay, well,

20:35.625 --> 20:37.192
I guess Mutiny On
the Bounty

20:37.366 --> 20:40.369
is the very best pirate movie,
the Clark Gable version.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.416
Wait, that's not
a pirate movie.

20:43.590 --> 20:44.373
That's a swashbuckler.

20:44.547 --> 20:45.722
There's a big difference.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.289
Oh, sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.421
PHOEBE:
Do you have
your doctorate

20:48.595 --> 20:49.944
in pirates, as well?

20:50.118 --> 20:51.685
No, I grew up watching
pirate movies with my Dad.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.817
Hey, I got this.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.429
Captain Bloodand Cutthroat Island,  Blackbeard's Ghost...

20:56.603 --> 20:58.213
I mean, I've seen 'em all.

20:58.387 --> 21:01.216
Even Yellowbeard,
it's a great spoof.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.870
You're just full of
surprises, aren't you?

21:03.044 --> 21:04.132
Wait until tonight.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.351
[laughs]

21:05.525 --> 21:06.308
Well, we're still on,
aren't we?

21:06.482 --> 21:07.440
Come on. You wouldn't want

21:07.614 --> 21:08.702
to break the pirate's oath.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.660
The pirate's oath?
What's that?

21:10.834 --> 21:13.315
Oh, yeah, pirate's oath.
If a Captain gives
his word to his crew,

21:13.489 --> 21:15.274
he's gotta hold to it
or face mutiny.

21:15.448 --> 21:16.753
Hmm.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.581
And would I be
the captain or the crew

21:18.755 --> 21:19.582
in that analogy?

21:19.756 --> 21:21.149
Well, it is your column.

21:21.323 --> 21:24.021
Yeah, I wouldn't want to
disappoint my readers.

21:24.195 --> 21:27.329
So what else do you want
to know about pirates?

21:27.503 --> 21:29.679
SHERIDAN:
Tell me this isn't happening.

21:29.853 --> 21:31.028
I cannot freakin' believe

21:31.202 --> 21:32.508
he's gonna pull us
off this case.

21:32.682 --> 21:33.901
Listen, the truth is,
we don't really have

21:34.075 --> 21:35.294
that much to go on.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.078
Oh, we've got plenty
to go on, Morris.

21:37.252 --> 21:38.427
And we'd have a hell of a lot
more if you came clean.

21:38.601 --> 21:41.474
You think I know more
than what I do.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.432
Look, don't
insult me, okay?

21:43.606 --> 21:45.608
We both know that you're
covering for them,

21:45.782 --> 21:48.002
so don't pretend
like you're not.

21:49.917 --> 21:53.616
All I know is, the Halliwells
are really good people.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.009
[scoffs]

21:55.183 --> 21:56.445
They do good things.
Yeah.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.273
Like send us
on a wild goose chase

21:58.447 --> 22:00.231
so that they can do
God only knows what.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.277
Six years

22:02.451 --> 22:03.974
of unsolved crimes of all types,

22:04.148 --> 22:06.063
all mysteriously connected
to them.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.023
I don't care
what you say, Morris.

22:09.197 --> 22:10.459
That's not good people.

22:13.897 --> 22:14.855
Who are you calling?

22:15.029 --> 22:16.073
Captain wants tangible proof.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.901
I'm calling the Feds.

22:18.075 --> 22:20.034
See what happened
to that damn
blood sample

22:20.208 --> 22:21.470
once and for all.

22:22.558 --> 22:24.125
[ringing stops]

22:25.996 --> 22:27.346
You want the Feds?

22:28.869 --> 22:30.261
You got 'em.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.752
I think I found something.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.363
Huh?

22:44.537 --> 22:46.365
I said I think
I found something.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.454
What, are you
deaf now, too?
[sighs]

22:48.628 --> 22:50.369
Well, you're gonna
go deaf first.

22:50.543 --> 22:51.935
Don't forget,
you're the older sister.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.241
Yeah, I love you, too.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.764
Okay, so,

22:54.938 --> 22:56.897
uh, does Black Jack Cutting
sound familiar?

22:57.071 --> 22:58.986
No. Actually, we weren't
formally introduced.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.509
Well, it says here,

23:00.683 --> 23:02.990
he tricked a witch
into falling for him

23:03.164 --> 23:05.775
in the 18th century
so she could give
him immortality.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.081
Hm, that's quite a spell.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.430
Yeah, it didn't
help her much.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.737
Um, he cut her heart out

23:10.911 --> 23:13.087
with the same athamé
she used to curse him.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.567
Who?

23:14.741 --> 23:15.785
What do you mean,
who? The Captain.

23:15.959 --> 23:16.917
The guy we're
talking about.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.440
Right. Right, right.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.529
Uh... Wait.
What was the question?

23:20.703 --> 23:21.878
Are you all right?

23:22.052 --> 23:23.227
You don't look so good.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.838
I look fine.

23:25.012 --> 23:27.275
And, yeah, I'm just concerned
with Brenda, I guess.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.103
I don't know.
Okay, let's see.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.626
He did say something

23:30.800 --> 23:33.237
about a storm,
a gathering storm.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.283
Well, there was nothing
about a storm.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.111
Just the curse.Hmm.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.853
Well, I guess I'd better make
these potions a little stronger.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.768
[footsteps approaching]

23:41.942 --> 23:43.639
Yo, ho, hello!

23:43.813 --> 23:45.554
Did you just call me a ho?

23:45.728 --> 23:47.121
PIPER:
How'd you get here?

23:47.295 --> 23:49.428
A pirate never betrays his vow
of secrecy.

23:50.603 --> 23:51.604
Leo orbed me.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.083
Go ahead, ask
me anything

23:53.257 --> 23:54.563
you want to know
about buccaneers.

23:54.737 --> 23:56.304
I know everything.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.828
You see a movie critic,
and suddenly you're an expert.

23:59.002 --> 24:00.351
No, I ran into Leslie,

24:00.526 --> 24:02.528
and he taught me
everything he knows.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.660
Mm, I bet.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.576
Looking forward
to your date tonight?

24:07.750 --> 24:09.230
No, I'm not. It's just
a publicity stunt.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.145
Mm-hmm, right.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.234
[glass breaking]PAIGE:
Oops!

24:13.408 --> 24:15.323
PIPER:
Paige? What...?

24:15.497 --> 24:17.020
PHOEBE:
What happened, honey?

24:17.194 --> 24:18.195
What's wrong
with your hand?

24:18.369 --> 24:20.459
Uh...

24:20.633 --> 24:22.765
I don't know.

24:22.939 --> 24:25.464
I think that athamé
did more damage than we thought.

24:25.638 --> 24:28.945
I'm gonna just go sit
on the couch, okay? Uh...

24:29.119 --> 24:31.426
maybe you guys concentrate
on Brenda and

24:31.600 --> 24:34.821
making more potions.

24:46.702 --> 24:48.922
Are you sure that we're talking
about the same man?

24:49.096 --> 24:50.837
All right.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.839
Thank you.

24:53.013 --> 24:56.146
Okay, Agent Brody,
you check out...

24:56.320 --> 24:57.887
for now.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.367
Great.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.674
Now can we get to work?

25:02.805 --> 25:04.503
What agency did they
say he was from?

25:04.677 --> 25:06.461
Homeland Security.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.202
What division?

25:08.376 --> 25:10.073
The classified one.

25:11.597 --> 25:13.424
You're, uh, pretty protective
of the sisters,

25:13.599 --> 25:15.035
aren't you,
Lieutenant?

25:15.209 --> 25:16.515
I've known them a long time.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.952
Six and a half years,
to be exact.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.344
I do my homework.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.432
So, what are you doing here?

25:21.607 --> 25:23.130
What do you want?

25:23.304 --> 25:25.219
I want to know where you got
that blood sample from.

25:25.393 --> 25:26.612
Why?

25:26.786 --> 25:29.005
Because whatever it is,
it's not human.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.095
DNA showed a triple helix.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.401
Now, we've only got two.

25:33.575 --> 25:34.924
Plus, plasma, platelets,

25:35.098 --> 25:36.447
RH factors--

25:36.622 --> 25:37.971
they're all incredible.
Somebody messed up.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.581
You were not supposed
to find that blood.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.279
I don't understand.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.325
You want to explain it to her?

25:44.499 --> 25:46.806
Explain what?

25:46.980 --> 25:49.417
What kind of being
that sample came from.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.114
DARRYL:
Being?

25:51.288 --> 25:52.463
How would I know?

25:54.335 --> 25:55.945
Don't worry, Lieutenant.

25:56.119 --> 25:57.425
I'm not after you.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.166
I'm after the Halliwells.

26:00.297 --> 26:03.083
Now, the recent rash
of missing women

26:03.257 --> 26:04.214
that you've been ignoring

26:04.388 --> 26:05.738
matches a pattern

26:05.912 --> 26:06.913
that goes back for decades.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.089
Barbados, Panama,

26:09.263 --> 26:11.831
Newfoundland,
New Orleans, and now here.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.660
Except they aren't
missing women.

26:16.357 --> 26:17.924
They're missing witches.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.795
Witches?

26:19.969 --> 26:22.276
Just like the three sisters,
and if I'm right, then, uh,

26:22.450 --> 26:23.973
one will lead us
to the other.

26:24.147 --> 26:27.281
So, you're saying that
the Halliwells are not human?

26:27.455 --> 26:28.935
No, no, they're human,
all right.

26:29.109 --> 26:32.025
But the sample just came
from something... else.

26:33.722 --> 26:36.812
So, if I were you,
I'd watch my step.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.771
People tend to disappear
around these girls.

26:38.945 --> 26:41.382
Especially cops.

26:41.556 --> 26:44.690
Now I have been looking
for a long time

26:44.864 --> 26:46.213
to prove my theories.

26:46.387 --> 26:48.911
Now all I got to do
is catch 'em in the act.

26:49.085 --> 26:50.478
But how?

26:50.652 --> 26:52.741
You got any golden chalices
lying around?

27:09.105 --> 27:10.846
Maybe Paige scared them away.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.501
It's possible.

27:13.675 --> 27:16.286
Pirates don't run from fights,
they lure you into them.

27:16.460 --> 27:21.335
[woman moaning faintly]

27:22.641 --> 27:23.554
Piper...

27:23.729 --> 27:24.991
come here!
Grab that lantern.

27:25.165 --> 27:28.908
[woman groaning]

27:33.782 --> 27:35.523
You must leave.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.743
Who did this to you?

27:37.917 --> 27:39.570
Pirates.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.791
He cut me with the athamé.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.227
[shuddering]

27:44.401 --> 27:45.489
Wait a minute.

27:45.664 --> 27:46.795
Who are you?
What's your name?

27:46.969 --> 27:48.667
Brenda.

27:49.929 --> 27:51.191
Save your sister.

27:51.365 --> 27:54.237
[shuddering]

27:54.411 --> 27:56.500
[moans gently]

27:58.285 --> 28:00.113
We got to
go get Paige.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.946
PHOEBE:
Paige, are you okay?

28:09.992 --> 28:11.385
Paige?

28:12.865 --> 28:13.909
Well...

28:14.083 --> 28:16.999
nowI'm a ma'am.

28:25.791 --> 28:26.966
Oh!

28:27.140 --> 28:28.968
Easy, easy, easy. We
got you, we got you.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.448
It took a little more out of me
than I thought.

28:31.622 --> 28:32.928
Yeah, here.
Couch, couch.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.582
Leo, get up here!

28:34.756 --> 28:37.498
Oh, are you two
back together?

28:37.672 --> 28:38.804
Oh, I forget.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.153
Oh. Leo!

28:40.327 --> 28:41.589
LEO:
What's the matter?

28:41.763 --> 28:43.547
What happened?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.810
Just heal this

28:44.984 --> 28:45.898
now.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.334
Heal... heal what?

28:47.508 --> 28:48.117
It's Paige!

28:48.291 --> 28:49.162
It's just Paige.

28:49.336 --> 28:50.729
She's just...

28:50.903 --> 28:52.121
Don't ask, just fix her.

28:52.295 --> 28:53.122
Fix it? What happened?

28:53.296 --> 28:54.558
Well, she got cut

28:54.733 --> 28:56.778
by a cursed athamé,
and she's aging.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.562
Aging. Well,
I can't
fix aging.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.912
I can't find
a reversal

29:00.086 --> 29:01.565
to the curse in
here anywhere.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.045
Naturally.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.786
PHOEBE:
Still, Captain
Cutting

29:04.960 --> 29:06.875
must be banking on us finding
a reversal to the curse

29:07.049 --> 29:08.572
so that we could save them both.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.313
Maybe I should go check with
the Elders, see

29:10.487 --> 29:12.098
if they know...No, we don't have time.

29:12.272 --> 29:13.882
She's gaining years by the hour.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.101
PAIGE:
Forget about me.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.885
You have to save Brenda first.

29:17.059 --> 29:19.627
Uh, sweetie, we
lost her already.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.324
Yeah, but we're not
gonna lose you, too.

Shiver me britches...

29:25.285 --> 29:26.590
Shiver me britches.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.678
[squawks]

29:27.853 --> 29:29.289
You've got to be kidding me.

29:29.463 --> 29:30.203
No, Piper,

29:30.377 --> 29:31.770
don't blow him up!

Fine!

29:33.075 --> 29:34.947
[squawks]

29:35.121 --> 29:36.862
Obviously, it was sent here
for a reason.

29:43.390 --> 29:44.391
What's it say?

29:44.565 --> 29:45.435
LEO: "Captain
Blackjack Cutting

[chuckles]

29:58.361 --> 29:59.754
Now you wouldn't
want to be

29:59.928 --> 30:01.277
violating
parlay, would you?

30:01.451 --> 30:02.975
PIPER:
Phoebe...

30:03.149 --> 30:05.325
now is not the time
for stupid pirate facts.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.414
How would you know
about parlay?

30:07.588 --> 30:09.720
Actually, I know
everything about parlay.

30:09.895 --> 30:10.939
Everyone does.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.506
It's the sacredness

30:12.680 --> 30:14.551
of the captain's word,
right, Piper?

30:14.725 --> 30:15.726
PIPER:
Hmm?

30:15.901 --> 30:16.640
PHOEBE:
You remember,

30:16.815 --> 30:17.641
Pirates Of The Caribbean?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.208
[stammers]... okay. So?

30:19.382 --> 30:20.731
PHOEBE:
So...

30:20.906 --> 30:23.038
it's what keeps
the crew from mutiny.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.084
Yeah,

30:25.258 --> 30:27.347
it's the oath of
the pirates, right?

30:27.521 --> 30:29.088
As long as the

30:29.262 --> 30:30.741
captain keeps his word,

30:30.916 --> 30:33.222
you're bound
to him forever.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.441
Yeah.

30:34.615 --> 30:37.009
And what's it to you?

30:37.183 --> 30:40.273
Well, quite honestly,
it just doesn't seem fair.

30:40.447 --> 30:41.970
I mean, he's the one
that's cursed,

30:42.144 --> 30:43.450
not you, right?

30:44.625 --> 30:47.846
I mean, how are you
ever supposed to move on?

30:50.892 --> 30:51.632
What are you jabbering

30:51.806 --> 30:52.938
about over there?

30:53.112 --> 30:53.982
Bring 'em closer!

30:54.156 --> 30:56.071
Whoa! Easy!

30:58.813 --> 31:00.902
Come to save your sister,
have you?

31:01.076 --> 31:02.861
How noble of you.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.514
[parrot squawks]PHOEBE:
You're wasting your time.

31:04.688 --> 31:06.038
We don't know how
to reverse the curse.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.126
You don't have to.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.605
Just need to call

31:08.779 --> 31:10.781
forth the Fountain of Youth.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.264
That's a myth.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.179
So are 300-year-old
pirates

31:17.353 --> 31:19.878
who sail the high seas
searching for revenge!

31:20.052 --> 31:23.925
Take if from me, the Fountain
of Youth is very real.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.927
Only Ponce de León had it wrong.

31:26.101 --> 31:27.450
I've got it right.

31:27.624 --> 31:30.018
And finding it is the only way

31:30.192 --> 31:32.760
to save your precious
sister's life.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.631
[parrot squawks,
Cutting chuckles]

31:37.373 --> 31:39.071
He wants you to do what?

31:39.245 --> 31:41.508
You heard me--
break into a museum.

31:41.682 --> 31:42.857
To find the Fountain of Youth.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.815
No, to steal a golden chalice

31:44.990 --> 31:46.774
that turns on
the Fountain of Youth.

31:46.948 --> 31:47.906
Piper, you can't do this.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.472
I don't have a choice.

31:49.646 --> 31:50.952
Without the chalice,
I can't cast a spell.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.606
Without the spell,
I can't save Paige.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.738
So there you go.Well, what if
you get caught?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.566
Thas is exactly what
Sheridan wants.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.438
Forget about her,
this is about family--

31:58.612 --> 32:01.093
a family, by the way, you have
to be able to take care of

32:01.267 --> 32:02.224
if anything happens to us.

32:02.398 --> 32:03.791
Piper...

32:03.965 --> 32:05.271
No, I mean it, Leo.
You need to promise me

32:05.445 --> 32:06.794
you'll be able
to take care of them.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.448
I can't believe
you're saying this.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.233
Well, believe it.

32:11.407 --> 32:13.583
Ignore the voices,
and you'll be fine.

32:13.757 --> 32:14.845
You have to be.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.248
So far, so good.

32:26.422 --> 32:27.728
Oh, yeah?

32:27.902 --> 32:31.210
Oh... wow.

32:31.384 --> 32:34.039
If we pull this off,
Paige owes me Prada.

32:34.213 --> 32:37.303
And babysitting
for a year.

32:45.528 --> 32:46.877
[cell phone buzzing]

32:47.052 --> 32:48.662
[whispers]:
Ooh! You're getting a call now?!

32:48.836 --> 32:50.272
Oh, no. Oh, no.

32:50.446 --> 32:51.534
Piper, it's Leslie.

32:51.708 --> 32:52.971
I totally forgot
about our date.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.537
Don't you mean
your publicity stunt?

32:54.711 --> 32:56.148
What do you
want from me?

32:56.322 --> 32:58.106
I want you to admit that
maybe you like him a little.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.152
No.Well, are you
gonna answer it?

33:00.326 --> 33:01.762
No, I'm not gonna
answer it, we're a
little busy right now.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.720
What am I gonna tell him?
We're robbing a museum?

33:03.894 --> 33:06.071
[line ringing]

33:06.245 --> 33:08.551
[diners chatting indistinctly]

33:08.725 --> 33:11.685
[elegant piano music playing]

33:17.691 --> 33:20.259
Okay, deep breath,
clear your mind,

33:20.433 --> 33:23.914
think positive, think positive,
ready, ready, ready.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.830
Okay, after you.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.484
[sighs]

33:30.486 --> 33:31.835
Ooh!

33:38.364 --> 33:39.756
Easy.

33:47.068 --> 33:47.590
[whispers]:
Careful!

33:51.725 --> 33:54.075
[panting]

34:10.526 --> 34:11.875
Okay.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.139
Now what?

34:16.228 --> 34:18.708
[glass shattering]Oh! Oh! Uh...

34:18.882 --> 34:21.189
Nicely done.

34:31.547 --> 34:32.331
[alarm ringing]

34:32.505 --> 34:33.723
Oh...

34:38.206 --> 34:41.296
This is bad.
This is bad.

34:42.906 --> 34:44.473
How did you know they'd be here?

34:44.647 --> 34:45.866
What are you doing?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.041
What do you mean?
I'm gonna bust them.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.477
Not with that thing
you're not.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.610
Besides, I don't want
to catch them stealing.

34:50.784 --> 34:52.394
I want to catch them
using magic.

35:09.803 --> 35:11.239
Welcome back, ladies.

35:11.413 --> 35:12.414
Stow it!

35:12.588 --> 35:13.676
Here's your chalice.

35:13.850 --> 35:14.895
What's your hurry?

35:15.983 --> 35:17.202
[squawking]

35:21.119 --> 35:23.947
[sighs]

35:25.949 --> 35:28.561
Now the spell,

35:28.735 --> 35:31.477
if you will.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.609
PIPER:
"With these
offerings, I call

35:33.783 --> 35:35.045
"on thee, the goddess
of fertility.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.526
"Rise now, show
us the truth,

35:37.700 --> 35:40.442
give us the gift
of eternal youth."

35:42.488 --> 35:44.620
Look!
[men exclaiming]

35:48.189 --> 35:50.235
[gasps]

35:50.409 --> 35:51.584
[sniffs]

36:01.507 --> 36:02.812
PIRATE:
He's young again!

36:04.727 --> 36:05.815
Mother of God.

36:05.989 --> 36:06.773
[squawks]

36:07.817 --> 36:09.689
PIRATE [whispers]:
It works!

36:09.863 --> 36:11.169
Now... my sister.

36:13.432 --> 36:14.476
What about her?

36:15.564 --> 36:16.435
Run them through!

36:17.914 --> 36:18.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:19.133 --> 36:20.134
He just broke his oath.

36:20.308 --> 36:21.396
He promised not

36:21.570 --> 36:23.006
to hurt us, remember?

36:23.181 --> 36:24.573
I said kill them.
What are you waiting for?

36:24.747 --> 36:26.271
[screams]He doesn't care
about his oath

36:26.445 --> 36:27.794
or parlay.
All he cares

36:27.968 --> 36:29.970
about is himself.

36:30.144 --> 36:32.015
He promised you treasures,
right?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.800
He promised you freedom,
but where is it?

36:33.974 --> 36:35.367
He lied!

36:36.368 --> 36:38.021
He broke his oath
and now you can, too.

36:38.196 --> 36:42.025
[pirates muttering]

36:42.200 --> 36:43.984
CAPTAIN CUTTING:
I'll have you drawn
and quartered,

36:44.158 --> 36:48.423
sir, raised from the
highest yardarm until
the sun rots your skin.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.773
Then I'll feed you
to the sharks.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.691
Looks like mutiny to me.

36:55.865 --> 36:57.215
You'll die, too, you know.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.217
You're only alive because of me.

36:59.391 --> 37:03.960
It's a fate worse than death,
I can assure you.

37:04.134 --> 37:04.570
[groans]

37:04.744 --> 37:05.484
Ooh!

37:16.799 --> 37:18.366
Thank you.

37:23.545 --> 37:25.112
[squawks]

37:28.942 --> 37:30.422
Nice speech.

37:30.596 --> 37:33.599
There's still some left.
We got to get it to Paige.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.296
Wait!

37:35.470 --> 37:38.256
We don't want this happening
anytime again soon.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.824
SHERIDAN:
Hold it right there!

37:41.998 --> 37:44.610
I don't know how you did that,
but just don't move.

37:44.784 --> 37:45.785
Uh-oh.

37:45.959 --> 37:46.568
Darryl, do something.

37:46.742 --> 37:47.743
I can't.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.049
Face down, on the ground!

37:49.223 --> 37:50.268
Now!

37:50.442 --> 37:52.226
[whoosh]

37:55.882 --> 37:57.144
Dart gun.

38:04.238 --> 38:07.241
Told you, Morris,
I wasn't after you.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.069
She'll be all right.

38:09.243 --> 38:10.636
She's gonna wake up with
a hell of a headache, though.

38:10.810 --> 38:11.593
Who are you?

38:11.767 --> 38:13.116
Someone you owe now.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.859
Go on, get out of here.
I'll take care of her.

38:17.033 --> 38:19.079
You got a sister to save, right?

38:27.609 --> 38:29.611
Think you can give me
a hand with her?

38:30.786 --> 38:33.789
Seriously, I think
I'm gonna need some help.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.940
PAIGE:
Hey.

38:54.114 --> 38:55.028
Hey.

38:55.202 --> 38:56.551
How you feeling?

38:56.725 --> 38:59.032
I feel young,
I feel grateful.

38:59.206 --> 39:00.903
You're not gonna hear me
complain

39:01.077 --> 39:03.515
about getting old again
till I'm at least 75.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.648
The good news is, you know,
you'll be there before I am.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.258
You're right.

39:08.433 --> 39:11.261
Hey, uh, what did that
Agent Brody guy want, anyway?

39:11.436 --> 39:14.439
I don't know,
but that's tomorrow's problem.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.007
[baby cooing]

39:22.360 --> 39:23.665
He did a good job.

39:23.839 --> 39:24.710
Yeah.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.625
He did.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.670
Think he'll stay
that way?

39:28.844 --> 39:30.368
I hope so.

39:32.152 --> 39:33.675
All right,
good night, sweetie.

39:33.849 --> 39:36.069
Good night... ma'am.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.338
It's not over yet,
you know.

39:46.122 --> 39:48.255
His wounds
won't easily heal.

39:48.429 --> 39:50.213
They may never.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.650
I know.

39:51.824 --> 39:53.303
Just don't give up on him,
Piper.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.915
We're all going
to need him back

39:56.089 --> 39:58.483
before the gathering storm.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.059
[door creaks]

40:11.931 --> 40:13.672
[typing at keyboard]

40:18.590 --> 40:20.156
Knock, knock.

40:28.948 --> 40:30.471
Oh, you're really
mad, aren't you?

40:30.645 --> 40:32.778
No, no, no,
I get stood up
all the time.

40:32.952 --> 40:34.649
I'm sure
that's not true.

40:34.823 --> 40:35.824
Listen, uh...

40:35.998 --> 40:37.565
I would have
called you, but I...

40:37.739 --> 40:39.219
But what?
Why didn't you?

40:39.393 --> 40:40.916
Uh, you know what?
It's kind of complicated.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.788
You know what?
You use that excuse a lot.

40:42.962 --> 40:44.746
I mean, is it something
you're not telling me

40:44.920 --> 40:46.313
or-or do you just
think I'm stupid?

40:46.487 --> 40:48.010
No, of course, I don't think
you're stupid.

40:48.184 --> 40:49.577
Well, then what is it?
What are you afraid of?

40:49.751 --> 40:51.753
Who says I'm afraid of anything?

40:51.927 --> 40:53.407
You're afraid of
commitment, aren't you?

40:53.581 --> 40:54.582
Commitment?!

40:54.756 --> 40:55.540
Wait, what are you
talking about?

40:55.714 --> 40:56.715
What commitment? I thought

40:56.889 --> 40:57.933
this was just
a publicity stunt.

40:58.107 --> 41:00.414
Oh, the hell you did.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.764
I mean, come on, why can't you
just admit you like me?
What is the big deal?

41:02.938 --> 41:05.158
Oh, you're one
to talk, mister.

41:05.332 --> 41:07.247
You're the one that had
to orchestrate

41:07.421 --> 41:08.857
this whole "contest"

41:09.031 --> 41:10.424
because you were too afraid
to ask me out straight.

41:10.598 --> 41:11.469
That is not true.

41:11.643 --> 41:13.253
Oh, no?
It's not true.

41:13.427 --> 41:15.211
Oh, really? Okay...

41:15.385 --> 41:17.126
then how come you didn't tell me
about it

41:17.300 --> 41:19.085
until after
you already printed it?

41:19.259 --> 41:20.260
Until after

41:20.434 --> 41:22.088
you "won" the contest?

41:22.262 --> 41:23.568
Yeah, that's right.

41:23.742 --> 41:24.917
I knew the whole time.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.222
And you didn't say anything.

41:26.396 --> 41:27.354
No, youdidn't say anything.

41:27.528 --> 41:28.660
You never called me back.

41:28.834 --> 41:30.531
Oh, you know what, that's lame.

If you knew about the contest,

41:32.228 --> 41:32.794
why did you agree
to go through with it?

41:32.968 --> 41:34.317
Well, because...

41:34.492 --> 41:35.231
Because of what? Come on.

41:35.405 --> 41:36.406
Honestly,

41:36.581 --> 41:37.843
you want
to know the truth?

41:38.017 --> 41:39.932
I didn't want to embarrass you.

[imitates buzzer]
Wrong answer.

41:41.934 --> 41:43.544
You know what?
You don't know me.

41:43.718 --> 41:44.719
You won't let me know you.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.068
That's not true.

41:46.242 --> 41:47.679
You're afraid of getting
involved with me

41:47.853 --> 41:48.941
because you're afraid
of getting hurt again.

41:49.115 --> 41:50.638
Save the advice
for your readers.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.422
You read me...
