WEBVTT

00:49.400 --> 00:52.600
No way!
He's back for round two.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.240
Nah, just having a look.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.600
Hey.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.760
They wanted to know
where Stairway was, so...

01:01.840 --> 01:04.240
So, Anchor Cove let you in?

01:04.320 --> 01:05.640
Not yet.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.200
They're still deciding.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.920
Is it working?

01:09.000 --> 01:09.880
Not yet.

01:09.960 --> 01:12.480
Probably tomorrow after that
low pressure system moves off.

01:12.560 --> 01:16.560
Oi Gibson,
last year when Marlon piked,

01:16.640 --> 01:19.120
did you get cooked doing the
jump or out at the reef break?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.680
The reef but,
I don't really remember.

01:21.760 --> 01:24.320
Chill bro, let's keep it going.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.040
You should
come back tomorrow.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.680
See how it's meant to be done.

01:47.720 --> 01:49.600
Whoo and a wipeout!

01:49.680 --> 01:50.800
All right, hold on...

01:50.880 --> 01:52.160
It's a local tradition.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.520
Stairway's pumping
like once a year,

01:53.600 --> 01:55.240
so everyone gets obsessed
over the big waves.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.840
Let's do it then.
It can be my big send off.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.000
Any of you thinking
of going up there

01:59.080 --> 02:01.760
you're barred from the Club
all right. So just relax.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.680
I can't believe

02:04.760 --> 02:06.800
you're going back to
New York in a week.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.480
Our lives are going
to be so empty.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.360
Hey you know it's true.

02:10.440 --> 02:12.280
Yo, you guys should come
visit me in New York.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.480
Yes, and then
let's go to Hawaii.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.240
Pops, Hawaii's on
the way to New York.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.200
I know that.
It's also on the way back.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.440
-Think about it.
-You think about it.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.920
Sorry, I'll be
back in a second.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.600
Oi boofheads!

02:28.680 --> 02:30.640
Stop trying to
avoid crafternoon.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.120
Oh I love
your hair this length.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.760
It's absolutely gorgeous.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.760
It's been the same for ages.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.520
Well, it's working.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.760
You really don't
have to do this.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.520
Oh Topher's got a garage full
of boards. He won't miss it.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.800
It's great you guys are
raising money for the Club.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.560
And I'm happy to contribute.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.920
So good to see the Boardriders
up and running again.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.200
You can take it now.
Rob Brooks original.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.360
Isn't it cool?

03:20.440 --> 03:21.760
Yeah, it's amazing.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.320
-Thanks.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.560
I was thinking of swinging by
the fundraiser tomorrow.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.080
Catch up with a few people.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.720
I think Dad's
going to be there.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.880
Well he hasn't been
returning my calls,

03:35.960 --> 03:38.280
so personally I
wouldn't mind a catch up.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.360
It's been two years, I'm pretty
sure we can keep it civil.

03:45.360 --> 03:46.800
Okay.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.200
-Okay.
-See you there.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.720
Yeah.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.880
Hey. Come and give me a hand
getting this in the car.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.440
If I break Honey's track
then I am a dead man.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.160
Yeah, no worries.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.760
You right mate?
You look a bit wrecked.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.320
Um!

05:08.560 --> 05:10.600
Yeah, Dad,
I was wondering...

05:11.960 --> 05:14.400
..have you ever been
freaked out?

05:14.480 --> 05:16.480
When you're out in the surf?

05:16.560 --> 05:18.920
Yeah, course mate.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.040
Happens to everyone
at some point.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.720
What happened?

05:22.800 --> 05:25.000
Nothing specific,

05:25.080 --> 05:26.440
it's more just I--

05:26.520 --> 05:30.280
Hey, um, there's been
a bit of a development.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.880
Where's Summer?

05:31.960 --> 05:33.680
She's in the
back garden with Honey,

05:33.760 --> 05:35.840
collecting more
of the 'contestants'.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.120
Um, they want to extent
Margot's Middle East thing.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.360
So she's asked if Summer
can stay with us a bit longer.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.040
About three months longer.

05:47.240 --> 05:48.800
Can we make that work?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.800
Well shouldn't we ask
Summer if that's okay?

05:51.880 --> 05:55.760
Ah well Margot hasn't
spoken to her yet.

05:55.840 --> 06:00.200
Look, um, until they talk,
let's not mention it to Summer.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.640
Or to Honey.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.440
All right we better get going

06:04.520 --> 06:07.000
or we'll be late
for the fundraiser.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.240
Hey if you're
not feeling up to it

06:08.320 --> 06:09.920
you know you can
stay home all right?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.960
No, um, I'm good.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.960
Welcome to the
Boardriders' Fundraiser.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.440
Hope these guys
are okay in here.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.520
Great to
see everyone here.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.760
So this is everyone?

06:25.840 --> 06:28.160
In Shorehaven? Yes it is.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.200
Your support is what keeps
Shorehaven Boardriders afloat.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.440
Frigg's Fish and Chips
is donating five bucks

06:35.520 --> 06:37.600
for every minute our
Boardriders' champs

06:37.680 --> 06:38.920
stay in the ice bath.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.160
And our brave coach has
volunteered to go first.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.520
Everybody give him
a warm welcome.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.840
This is how much
I love Shorehaven!

06:50.640 --> 06:53.800
And your
time starts now!

06:58.200 --> 07:01.640
Look who's come
crawling back, the traitor.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.640
Harsh, but fair.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.520
There, I helped.
I'm going to go.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.960
Hey, I agreed
to this weeks ago.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.400
If you want any rides

07:13.480 --> 07:16.600
to any more competitions ever,
you'll stay.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.480
Snail race starts
in 30 minutes people.

07:20.560 --> 07:23.760
Come choose your
gastropod! Yep!

07:23.840 --> 07:25.040
You don't want to miss it.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.880
So you knew she was coming?

07:37.960 --> 07:40.560
Yes, but I knew you wouldn't
come if she was here.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.800
She said you've been
screening her calls.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.520
Yeah, well, I've been busy.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.320
Here, your shirt's unbuttoned.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.480
I need to start selling these
raffle tickets in a minute.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.400
Mhm

07:54.480 --> 07:55.920
Can you try and have fun?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.800
Yeah, I'm going to have fun.
I'm here to party.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.160
I can tell from the shirt.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.800
Hey!

08:07.080 --> 08:09.200
And they're off!

08:09.280 --> 08:10.720
Lettuce Machine,
the hot favourite,

08:10.800 --> 08:12.680
fails to get the
start he wanted.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.640
Shelley MacLaine,
no doubt looking

08:14.720 --> 08:16.680
for the fastest
part of the track.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.600
Slytherin, yet to
emerge from his shell,

08:18.680 --> 08:20.520
but he's a real
late charger fellow.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.440
Mrs. Shelley, move your butt!

08:22.520 --> 08:24.440
That's five bucks on
Lettuce Machine?

08:24.520 --> 08:25.720
-You got it.
-Thanks.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.560
That's two-to-one on
Lettuce Machine, you all.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.080
Go get yourself a ticket.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.920
Thanks, we'll be drawing
the raffle in a few hours.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.320
Thank you,
that's the winning one.

08:43.560 --> 08:45.240
How long since
they even talked?

08:45.320 --> 08:46.640
Over a year, probably.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.840
It's way overdue.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.360
That wasn't too hard, was it?

08:59.440 --> 09:01.000
She wants custody.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.760
She wants you to live with her.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.440
Mum made a lot of food.
Like, a lot.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.040
Look, you're not
actually thinking

09:21.120 --> 09:23.080
of surfing Stairway
are you?

09:23.160 --> 09:25.240
Best time for the jump is 3pm.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.840
We're going to meet
just before then.

09:27.960 --> 09:30.160
You know Griff doesn't
decide who gets in the Club.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.600
You have nothing to prove.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.160
Easy for you to say.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.320
You're the guy who jumped.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.160
Look, Mars, there's still a
spot for you in Shorehaven.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.160
Just go to Manu and say,

09:42.240 --> 09:45.160
"Sorry, bro, I was
a bit of a pelican."

09:45.240 --> 09:46.840
It's too late for that, Gibson.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.240
No, no it's not!

09:56.880 --> 09:58.800
You know you caught a
wave that day, right?

10:01.160 --> 10:02.000
What?

10:03.360 --> 10:04.720
You paddled past the reef,

10:05.720 --> 10:08.320
and you got this
monster, massive wave.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.160
And you almost made it.

10:11.480 --> 10:14.000
What does it matter?
I barely remember anything.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.160
I think about it all the time.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.240
And it's like,
if I can just beat it,

10:23.360 --> 10:25.960
you know, face the beast,

10:27.600 --> 10:28.840
I can move on.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.920
Maybe I should come with you.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.200
No, you know you can't.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.880
No, just to make
sure you're safe.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.280
Yo Ari, come on Manu says
you're next up in the ice bath.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.040
Could you please
give us a second?

10:44.120 --> 10:44.840
What is going on?

10:44.920 --> 10:47.200
You Gibsons have been
acting super squirrely.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.160
We're talking about
surfing the Stairway.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.000
Conditions might not be
right for another year, so.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.000
Okay, so the dumbest
idea on the planet.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.360
No, no, no. We're not
actually surfing Stairway.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.920
Yeah, right. Exactly
how many panic attacks

10:58.000 --> 10:59.200
do you want to have, Ari?

10:59.720 --> 11:01.120
Panic attacks?

11:01.200 --> 11:02.840
Nothing, a stupid joke.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.760
I'm sure your parents
will find it hilarious.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.560
Summer, stop.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.800
No, I'm saving you
from your own stupidity.

11:07.880 --> 11:10.040
No wonder your mum
doesn't want you back.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.400
She still hasn't
called you, has she?

11:19.080 --> 11:20.520
What are you talking about?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.280
She's staying
in the Middle East

11:22.360 --> 11:24.600
and you are staying here,

11:24.680 --> 11:27.680
which is so,
so great for all of us.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.520
All I suggested was you might
want to spend more time with me.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.400
He's acting like a child.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.120
How much time we talking about?

11:45.680 --> 11:50.320
I was thinking,
every other week?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.720
Topher and I have moved
into the house now and

11:54.400 --> 11:55.800
his kids love it there.

11:56.760 --> 11:58.240
I think you would too.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.960
Sorry,
I'd rather stay with Dad.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.920
I know how much you
take care of him.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.680
You shouldn't be
in that position.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.280
How did we end up
in this position?

12:12.960 --> 12:13.800
Okay.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.440
I can see I'm not forgiven yet.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.240
I don't want to push anything.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.040
I've been checking the rankings,

12:25.520 --> 12:28.040
you're still in with a
chance for the State Team.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.320
Tiny one.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.960
Sometimes that's all you need.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.680
Whoa, 12 minutes,
we have a new record!

12:41.760 --> 12:44.880
Unfortunately, it's getting
a little bit boring.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.960
Hey, Pops,
sorry to distract you.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.520
Please, distract me.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.160
When you get out, I kind
of stuffed up with Summer.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.440
Summer!

13:07.000 --> 13:09.240
Summer I'm so
glad you've called.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.120
I just got back
from this hellish job

13:12.200 --> 13:14.240
and everything went wrong.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.680
That's funny because I heard
things are going great for you.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.360
Has Abbie explained everything?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.320
Not really, no.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.520
Well, my editors love
what I've been doing

13:24.600 --> 13:25.760
and it seemed like things

13:25.840 --> 13:27.840
were going so well
for you over there,

13:27.920 --> 13:28.880
I thought you
wouldn't mind

13:28.960 --> 13:30.520
staying an extra few months.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.960
Extra months?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.320
Yeah, I meant
to call you sooner,

13:35.400 --> 13:37.600
but it's just been
so crazy with work

13:37.680 --> 13:41.120
and also I wanted to
make sure Abbie and Thommo

13:41.200 --> 13:42.200
were happy to have you

13:42.280 --> 13:44.840
for a little longer
before I ran it by you.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.960
Yeah right, because what
I want always comes last.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.640
Sum, would you give me a break?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.200
It's clear to anyone
that you're having

13:51.280 --> 13:52.640
a better time
of it in Shorehaven

13:52.720 --> 13:53.760
than you were in New York.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.760
You're getting this from what?

13:54.840 --> 13:55.960
A couple of selfies
you happen to see

13:56.040 --> 13:58.240
as you jumped in a Humvee?

13:58.320 --> 13:59.680
Always has to be a fight, right?

13:59.760 --> 14:01.720
Yeah, with you Margot, always.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.960
You know, maybe we just,
just face the fact,

14:03.040 --> 14:04.760
that we do better
when we're apart.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.160
Wow.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.400
Finally the truth.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.280
Hey, Ari told us
about the news.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.160
And he feels really bad
for how it came out.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.120
Yeah, totally.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.240
I'm sorry things
still aren't good

14:40.320 --> 14:41.280
with your mum or whatever, but

14:41.360 --> 14:43.240
we're so, so stoked
you're staying longer.

14:43.320 --> 14:44.680
What if I don't want
to stay any longer?

14:44.760 --> 14:46.400
Did anyone think of that?

14:46.480 --> 14:47.800
Kind of looked like you
were having a good time.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.880
Because I knew I was leaving!

14:49.960 --> 14:51.760
Even the most boring
stinkhole in the universe

14:51.840 --> 14:53.560
can be fun for five minutes.

14:53.640 --> 14:57.560
Okay, didn't realise it was
so painful hanging out with us.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.600
Do the math, Poppy.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.560
You're literally
the only people in town.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.160
I did the best
with what I had.

15:23.760 --> 15:24.800
Hey!

15:25.600 --> 15:29.040
Don't panic, but Shelley
MacLaine has gone missing.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.000
What're you up to?

15:32.080 --> 15:34.400
I was thinking of
surfing Stairway.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.760
You are such a crack up.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.960
I know.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.880
Anyway, can I leave you
to search this area?

15:43.960 --> 15:45.720
Shelley's very fast.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.640
Thank you.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.800
-One meat tray.
-Cheers.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.600
-Snacks for days, bro.
-Thanks

16:03.680 --> 16:05.040
Enjoy.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.160
Alright, folks,
now for the main event.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.320
She can't have meant all that.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.800
Or maybe we're finally
seeing the real Summer.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.840
The 1978
Rod Brook's original.

16:15.920 --> 16:18.320
With the signature
lightning bolt design.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.000
And the winning ticket is,

16:22.080 --> 16:23.560
B47!

16:26.360 --> 16:27.360
B47!

16:28.360 --> 16:30.120
Anyone?

16:30.200 --> 16:31.560
You beauty!

16:34.440 --> 16:35.600
Matthias!

16:35.680 --> 16:38.160
Awesome mate,
keeping it in the family.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.240
It's definitely here,
I definitely remember seeing it.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.040
So, here you go.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.120
Yeah, Matthias,
just hang on for a sec mate,

16:45.200 --> 16:46.400
I got to find the ticket.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.560
He doesn't want it,
he's just kidding.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.400
No, no. I'm not kidding, I mean
have a look at this thing.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.880
Hey, everyone, if I could
have your attention

16:53.960 --> 16:55.800
I just want to say
a big thank you to

16:55.880 --> 16:57.760
Jacqui Laurent
and her other half

16:57.840 --> 17:00.720
for generously donating
this amazing bit of gear.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.560
A big round of applause
for Jacqui, hey.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.440
So great having people like
you digging really deep.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.240
Puts some of us to shame,
doesn't it?

17:11.720 --> 17:13.400
Dad,

17:13.480 --> 17:14.400
please stop.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.200
I'm just kidding.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.400
Do a redraw, hey?

17:25.200 --> 17:26.920
Okay folks.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.440
Looks like ah,

17:29.400 --> 17:31.560
looks like we've got
a redraw on our hands.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.000
D21!

17:39.120 --> 17:41.720
So I guess this has been
a really fun day for you.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.880
You better not let Poppy
catch you in here.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.040
You want me to go?

17:48.960 --> 17:50.320
No,

17:50.400 --> 17:51.280
it's okay.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.280
I genuinely thought
that if my parents

17:59.360 --> 18:00.480
just saw each other in person

18:00.560 --> 18:04.720
they'd start working everything
out like a dumb 80s movie.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.840
You see the best in people,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.400
that's what makes you amazing.

18:10.680 --> 18:14.400
It's just a shame we can't
all be as amazing as you.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.120
You're very funny.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.360
Marlon, no.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.000
Sorry, sorry.
Thought there was a vibe.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.400
There's no vibe.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.560
I've missed you, that's all.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.800
Bodhs, you okay?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.080
Yeah, I'm great.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.560
What did you say to her?

18:45.640 --> 18:46.760
Aren't you in the
wrong Clubhouse?

18:46.840 --> 18:47.680
Poppy.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.560
Don't worry, I'm going.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.680
Alright, everyone! This is
the last race of the day.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.800
Get in here, place your bets.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.960
Sadly, we've had
a late scratching.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.720
Five dollars,
thank you so much.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.960
That's really helpful.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.280
Hey Ari, have you seen Marlon?

19:15.560 --> 19:17.120
No, it's been a second.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.200
If you do, please tell him

19:19.280 --> 19:20.800
he's required for
barbecue clean up.

19:20.880 --> 19:22.480
His career depends on it.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.800
Hey, can I put a bet on
Shells Bells? Thanks.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.360
Oi!

19:56.280 --> 19:58.040
So you're actually
going to do this?

19:59.520 --> 20:02.320
Griff and his crew,
they're not coming.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.800
It's just us.

20:36.840 --> 20:38.240
Hello boys.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.320
-No, no, no, no, no.
-She's kidding me.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.360
You're not
up to this, Summer.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.320
It's over, we can't go in
now. She'll jump in after us.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.960
What're you even doing here?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.800
Felt like I was losing my edge.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.360
Talked to Margot, didn't you?

20:55.440 --> 20:57.320
What did she say to you?

21:02.600 --> 21:04.960
Look, this is crazy.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.200
Let's just
go home, okay, yeah?

21:07.280 --> 21:09.440
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we're going home.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.960
You don't get to
tell me what to do.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.520
Summer!
Hey, hey! Hey!

21:17.600 --> 21:19.160
Summer!

21:23.360 --> 21:25.000
Summer!

21:53.520 --> 21:56.200
Summer!
Get on your board!

22:01.280 --> 22:02.520
Hang on.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.920
Come on, start paddling.
We'll go straight out.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.840
You've got to get
past the reef.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.240
Hold up. Look.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.240
Let's go home.

23:22.960 --> 23:24.560
Oh, no.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.520
It's Dad.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.040
Get in.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.400
They were out of tartare.

23:48.120 --> 23:50.120
Don't worry,
I didn't make a scene.

23:51.240 --> 23:52.560
That's a relief.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.120
Look, I'm sorry.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.880
This is a calamari
based apology.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.280
Dad, I know you're still
angry about Mum bailing on us.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.640
But it's like I've been
staying angry for you.

24:19.760 --> 24:21.440
You need to move on.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.160
So what does that mean?

24:26.200 --> 24:27.400
After the State Championships,

24:27.480 --> 24:29.360
I might stay with her
for a few days.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
See how it goes.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.600
Yeah, but we're a team.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.040
I need you here.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.880
I'll be around
when you need me.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.600
But I want my mum back.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.600
Even when I
was out there I thought,

25:00.680 --> 25:01.800
surely he's not going
to do this again,

25:01.880 --> 25:03.320
surely he's not going
to be that deluded.

25:03.400 --> 25:06.040
After everything
that you've been through.

25:06.120 --> 25:07.440
After everything
we've been through.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.000
What was going
through your head?

25:09.080 --> 25:10.520
I don't know.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.160
So your mum's
coming to get you?

25:13.240 --> 25:14.560
Yeah.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.000
I guess they don't trust me
on a plane by myself.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.960
Can I come with you?

25:25.000 --> 25:26.440
I'd be down with that.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.320
Central Park has a very
active birding community.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.760
Come here.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.280
Honey! Bed time now please.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.600
Bye.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.520
Help me to
try and understand

25:43.600 --> 25:44.760
why you would
have done this.

25:44.840 --> 25:47.320
The only reason I
went in was to help Summer.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.280
Nah, I don't buy that.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.600
You can kiss the rest
of your season goodbye mate.
