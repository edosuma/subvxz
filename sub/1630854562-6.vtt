WEBVTT

00:10.478 --> 00:12.480
I hope we're not so late,
we've missed all the fun.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.514
Aha!

00:13.514 --> 00:15.549
<i>There has to be
a letter from Christine here.</i>

00:15.549 --> 00:16.650
<i>But I'm about to become</i>

00:16.650 --> 00:18.219
<i>the most powerful surgeon
in France.</i>

00:18.219 --> 00:20.354
<i>She tried to take my husband.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:22.656
And when that failed,
she cut her wrists before me.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.558
<i>You asked me
to seduce this woman,</i>

00:24.558 --> 00:26.761
<i>yet you give me
no proof of her wrong.</i>

00:26.761 --> 00:27.762
<i>She took everything</i>

00:27.762 --> 00:28.763
<i>that mattered from me.</i>

00:28.763 --> 00:30.097
<i>Valmont!</i>

00:30.097 --> 00:31.399
<i>Break the engagement.</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:32.800
<i>Then you will have
your letter,</i>

00:33.033 --> 00:35.669
<i>and you can pretend
to be a good wife and mother</i>

00:35.669 --> 00:37.471
while you fuck our queen.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.173
Stop this, Camille.

00:39.173 --> 00:42.309
<i>It seems we cannot
trust one another after all.</i>

00:43.310 --> 00:45.212
Musket makes a fool of you

00:45.212 --> 00:47.648
<i>and libels the very heart
of this monarchy</i>

00:47.648 --> 00:49.316
<i>with her immorality.</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:51.118
<i>You should marry your equal.</i>

00:51.118 --> 00:52.586
<i>You should marry me.</i>

01:20.181 --> 01:22.817
Are you a spirit now, Valmont,

01:22.817 --> 01:25.653
come to haunt me in this crypt?

01:25.653 --> 01:28.823
I hope you're here
to apologize.

01:28.823 --> 01:31.091
I received a visit
from the chevalier.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.327
Told me Christine de Sevigny
is ruined.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.699
He is prone to drama.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.602
I was there too.
She's... humbled.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.771
It will soon pass.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.206
She is disowned...

01:46.407 --> 01:48.442
...her head shaved already
for her sins.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.678
She's to go to the convent.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.279
She will never see
her daughter again.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.814
Emilie will also bear
her shame.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.583
Are you listening to me?

01:55.583 --> 01:57.451
She's ruined!

01:57.451 --> 01:58.786
Maurice too.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.855
They're pariahs because
of accusations of infidelity

02:00.855 --> 02:03.457
and a higher scandal too,

02:03.457 --> 02:05.226
which apparently
was revealed in her letter.

02:05.226 --> 02:07.728
Were these pawns
not captured in your game?

02:07.728 --> 02:10.397
Prove to me
you did not use my letter

02:10.397 --> 02:11.398
to bring her destruction.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.735
Bring it to me,
or I will walk away from you

02:14.735 --> 02:15.769
and never come back.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.705
Why does she matter to you?

02:21.408 --> 02:23.143
<i>Jacqueline's right.</i>

02:24.812 --> 02:28.382
To get what you want,
you will destroy anyone.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.560
I cannot bear the sight of you.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.978
<i>Finally,
someone to tell us the truth</i>

04:03.978 --> 04:05.412
<i>about Rambouillet.</i>

04:05.412 --> 04:06.814
<i>What happened there?</i>

04:06.814 --> 04:09.016
<i>You know I'm not one
for gossip, Léonard.</i>

04:09.249 --> 04:12.453
<i>Scandal, then.</i>

04:13.887 --> 04:16.023
I heard there was a letter

04:16.256 --> 04:19.493
full of the Comtesse's
wicked secrets.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.929
Do you recall
a letter, Camille?

04:25.933 --> 04:29.903
We witnessed the same
awful event, Vicomtesse,

04:29.903 --> 04:32.539
a lesson to all
who fall from the path.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.375
Christine didn't fall.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.943
She was pushed.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.912
She's ruined and, through her,
poor Maurice.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.882
That is a fate akin
to stepping on a kitten.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.418
Though dullness
might be considered a crime,

04:44.418 --> 04:46.286
might it not?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.288
Perhaps the real crime
is that men do not suffer

04:48.288 --> 04:49.957
for their own failings,

04:49.957 --> 04:52.726
only the failings
of their wives.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.962
Mademoiselle, shall we?

04:56.063 --> 04:58.565
Yes, let us not
keep you, Camille.

04:58.565 --> 05:02.536
And let us hope the Masked Ball
isn't similarly overshadowed.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.304
It's the event of the year.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.875
They say the king and queen
themselves will be there...

05:09.576 --> 05:13.714
...which is why I cannot fathom
how you've been invited.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.482
I haven't.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.818
I'm the Marquis' guest,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.019
though I suppose
he could hardly

05:19.019 --> 05:21.555
leave his new fiancée at home,
could he?

05:38.472 --> 05:41.642
It's a crime how such a face

05:41.642 --> 05:43.644
leads one to presume
you are an innocent,

05:43.644 --> 05:46.680
when I know how little
you can be trusted.

05:47.981 --> 05:51.652
Someone should warn
your misguided fiancé,

05:51.652 --> 05:55.989
even if only to prevent
his fortune dwindling.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.527
When do we choose our masks,
Madame Berthe?

06:00.527 --> 06:02.563
Do you need another one?

06:02.563 --> 06:05.833
Paris is a lonely place
without friends

06:05.833 --> 06:08.135
but a lethal one with enemies.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.506
I'm sorry you are lonely.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.941
Come.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.151
<i>Your candle, madame.</i>

06:32.159 --> 06:34.795
<i>I see these masks
not as facades</i>

06:34.795 --> 06:36.697
<i>but as reflections.</i>

06:36.697 --> 06:39.500
<i>Choosing them
is my private pleasure.</i>

06:41.568 --> 06:43.837
What did you choose for me?

06:45.172 --> 06:48.108
The fox, of course.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.511
<i>It's like looking
in the mirror, no?</i>

06:50.511 --> 06:52.880
Now, this mask
must be kept secret.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.782
<i>The women arrive first--</i>

06:54.782 --> 06:57.785
time to gossip,
take in their rivals,

06:57.785 --> 06:59.953
don their masks.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.989
Then the men arrive.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.458
That's when the game begins.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.194
Tell me who will wear
which mask.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.797
I'm nervous
I will offend the marquis

07:09.797 --> 07:13.100
through some liaison
of mistaken identity.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.702
One can get away
with almost anything

07:15.702 --> 07:17.938
when masked
at the Maison de Rieux.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.073
<i>And it is true
that all of society</i>

07:20.073 --> 07:23.811
will be there,
even Madame de Montrachet?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.747
I heard all she attends
is church.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.149
How she has anything left
to confess is beyond me.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.152
I think we met long ago.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.054
I'd love to be reacquainted.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.691
All the pious...

07:39.927 --> 07:41.461
...will be lambs.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.602
And her husband?

07:48.602 --> 07:50.671
He will be a lamb too?

07:51.672 --> 07:54.842
Monsieur de Montrachet...

07:54.842 --> 07:55.943
is not a lamb.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.117
He's a wolf.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.047
Azolan!

08:54.134 --> 08:55.769
Forgive my intrusion.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.105
It's not an intrusion if you
were already in my thoughts.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.841
My husband
has informed me he is...

09:00.841 --> 09:03.277
to receive a great advancement
in his work.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.078
I'd congratulate him,
but I cannot.

09:05.078 --> 09:07.881
This advancement
will mean...

09:07.881 --> 09:10.584
we will be required
at Versailles...

09:10.584 --> 09:11.885
indefinitely.

09:14.588 --> 09:18.292
That being so,
I-I came to ask if-if...

09:18.292 --> 09:20.727
if you...

09:20.727 --> 09:22.996
could come to the ball tonight.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.801
It might be the last time
that we see each other

09:27.801 --> 09:28.936
for some time.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.643
I don't want you to go.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.786
I have to stay
beside my husband.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.224
If you are beside him,
then where will I stand?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.960
Behind me, before me.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.696
I will always turn to face you.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.369
I'll pray on it.

10:07.874 --> 10:12.045
Monsieur Lucienne,
should you come...

10:12.045 --> 10:15.882
I will be wearing
the mask of a lamb.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.188
<i>I hope you will come.</i>

10:40.173 --> 10:41.842
Come.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.011
It makes me happy to spoil you.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.114
If it's happiness you want,
don't marry the Marquis.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.683
I'm beginning to think you
don't want me to marry anyone.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.085
<i>Valmont or Jean de Merteuil?</i>

10:52.953 --> 10:54.087
Valmont and I are finished.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.822
Well, then forgive
my lack of enthusiasm

10:55.822 --> 10:56.890
for your remaining choice.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.092
Should I forgive
your naivety too?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.995
Do you think
becoming a Marquise

11:01.995 --> 11:03.964
<i>was the destiny
for someone like me?</i>

11:03.964 --> 11:06.433
A woman with nothing
is a whore or a maid,

11:06.666 --> 11:08.301
and I will no longer be either.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.736
With him, you'll be both.

11:09.736 --> 11:13.006
No, I will do as Madame did.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.410
I will perfect a facade,
build walls around my heart

11:16.410 --> 11:18.045
for a life completely mine.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.681
And I will do it for us
so we will be safe.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.920
<i>Stop making enemies.</i>

11:26.920 --> 11:29.056
Then perhaps we will be safe.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.325
<i>Ondine, Florence,
the entire Sevigny family.</i>

11:32.325 --> 11:34.094
<i>And I hope you're not
going to the ball tonight</i>

11:34.094 --> 11:36.296
<i>because of the de Montrachets.</i>

11:36.296 --> 11:38.799
Walk away and find peace, Camille...

11:42.369 --> 11:45.072
...or you will lose me.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.083
Keep it...

11:56.083 --> 11:57.317
please.

11:58.819 --> 11:59.953
It will suit you.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.324
I do not want to lose you.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.358
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for the ball?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.534
Isn't it a chance
to show me off?

12:48.902 --> 12:51.138
Are you sure it's not
the other way around?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.942
I have an ancient title.
I'm very rich.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.246
I understand the attraction.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.151
You think that of me?

13:05.986 --> 13:09.055
That you're no different
to any of these women--

13:09.055 --> 13:12.192
Emilie, Christine, Ondine...

13:13.960 --> 13:15.862
...my late wife,
for that matter?

13:18.398 --> 13:19.933
Perhaps.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.470
Is that why you've been
avoiding me

13:23.470 --> 13:26.006
since we returned
from Rambouillet?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.414
Perhaps it's safer
to remain a widower.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.495
<i>Monsieur Lucienne,</i>

13:48.495 --> 13:52.299
<i>I do not know
which is the greater sin:</i>

13:52.299 --> 13:56.369
<i>lying to myself that I can
live without knowing you...</i>

13:56.369 --> 13:57.571
Monsieur.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.239
<i>...or that of knowing you.</i>

14:01.474 --> 14:03.877
<i>Tonight I do not care.</i>

14:03.877 --> 14:05.512
<i>In the anonymity of our masks,</i>

14:05.512 --> 14:09.282
<i>I want to exist
without such questions,</i>

14:09.282 --> 14:13.053
<i>beyond sin or purity,
truth or lies.</i>

14:16.122 --> 14:17.324
A present?

14:17.324 --> 14:19.226
<i>And if you want me...</i>

14:21.528 --> 14:23.463
<i>...know that I am yours.</i>

14:25.899 --> 14:27.033
<i>Jacqueline.</i>

14:32.906 --> 14:34.407
You going to the Masked Ball?

14:34.407 --> 14:35.909
<i>No.</i>

14:35.909 --> 14:38.378
<i>But what about
Madame de Montrachet?</i>

14:40.213 --> 14:42.082
She's better off without me.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.923
<i>Jean thinks
he can push me away,</i>

14:49.923 --> 14:51.458
<i>but I will win him back.</i>

14:51.458 --> 14:53.660
He has already turned you down.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.533
No one turns me down.

15:11.645 --> 15:14.347
I require your advice.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.684
Don't you know
everything already?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.352
An opinion, then.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.195
How far should I cinch
the waist on this corset?

15:36.469 --> 15:39.172
I'm going to the ball.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.282
Not without my invitation.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.586
You won't deny me that.

15:55.322 --> 15:59.392
Of course...
you could come with me.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.961
And I could share
some of those secrets

16:01.961 --> 16:03.263
that are in my possession.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.169
Like a fox...

16:09.169 --> 16:11.237
tearing through hens.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.358
Aha.

16:42.435 --> 16:46.005
I don't need a trail
of destruction in your wake.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.121
Destruction...

17:01.121 --> 17:03.790
is power in the wrong hand.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.629
Control is power
in the right one.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.236
It would be my gift to you...

17:16.236 --> 17:18.705
for all the kindness
you've shown me.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.414
I wasn't born to be alone, Jean.

17:30.083 --> 17:35.054
If your heart is truly
closed to me...

17:35.054 --> 17:36.823
I will find another.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.493
You will not go without me.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.635
Good.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.440
Get ready, then.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.804
Boo! Boo!

19:39.212 --> 19:40.747
<i>Feels like
I have you back again,</i>

19:40.747 --> 19:43.583
that it's like
old times between us.

19:48.555 --> 19:49.956
<i>Come on, let's go in.</i>

19:50.189 --> 19:50.957
<i>No, wait.</i>

19:55.628 --> 19:58.364
<i>Camille, what's wrong?</i>

19:58.364 --> 20:00.466
Good evening,
Madame de Montrachet.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.572
<i>She is why we're here.</i>

20:06.873 --> 20:09.275
<i>I have to take this chance.</i>

20:09.275 --> 20:11.511
I'm going to be the Marquise, Victoire.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.447
This marriage
will make me someone

20:14.447 --> 20:15.982
of higher rank than her,

20:16.215 --> 20:18.551
<i>someone people will listen to.</i>

20:18.551 --> 20:22.989
The Montrachets betrayed me
in the worst of ways.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.692
<i>But they cannot
dismiss me now.</i>

20:28.227 --> 20:30.663
My revenge.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.503
<i>Come.</i>

20:43.843 --> 20:45.645
Victoire.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.812
Good evening.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.047
Mademoiselle,
your name, please.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.549
Camille.

21:26.019 --> 21:29.455
Ah, Camille, beautiful.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.331
<i>I need a name.</i>

21:54.681 --> 21:57.583
<i>Ladies, welcome,
welcome, welcome, welcome.</i>

22:16.736 --> 22:20.339
<i>What else
but the most ornate of birds?</i>

22:20.339 --> 22:22.508
I've always been fond of you,
Madame Berthe.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.510
Let me help you
tie your lace.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.787
- Victoire.
- No, no, no.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.855
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

23:08.855 --> 23:09.922
Close the door, Azolan.

23:09.922 --> 23:10.990
Where she is,
so too is Camille,

23:10.990 --> 23:12.692
and I want
neither of them in here.

23:12.692 --> 23:13.793
<i>Please, Valmont.</i>

23:13.793 --> 23:15.762
I don't know what to do,
how to help her.

23:15.762 --> 23:17.830
Camille is no longer
my concern.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.700
Camille's going to marry Jean.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.471
She has chosen her equal.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.041
- Congratulate her.
- I cannot live with him.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.177
I cannot live with her.
She's not in her right mind.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.812
That's the first
smart thing you've said.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.013
I mean because of her obsession

23:34.013 --> 23:35.782
with Jacqueline de Montrachet.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.752
It's made her unwell,

23:39.752 --> 23:40.787
and it's scaring me.

23:40.787 --> 23:41.854
Jealousy has made her unwell.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.055
Jacqueline wronged her.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.757
Oh, really? How?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.093
I do not know all the details.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.828
All the details,
some of the details,

23:48.828 --> 23:50.029
any of the details--

23:50.029 --> 23:51.697
that is who this woman is.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.432
She is incapable of honesty.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.802
Do you want to know
what Jacqueline did?

23:55.802 --> 23:57.837
Nothing.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.739
Her only wrongdoing
was being married to a man

23:59.739 --> 24:01.107
that Camille wanted
for herself.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.208
- No.
- Yes.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.776
- No.
- Yes!

24:06.045 --> 24:07.146
<i>Yes.</i>

24:20.626 --> 24:23.462
She's going to destroy
Jacqueline at the ball tonight.

24:25.198 --> 24:28.534
Please, help me.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.945
The men are here!
The men are here!

24:38.945 --> 24:39.979
<i>Come!</i>

24:52.191 --> 24:53.726
Mademoiselle, lovely to...

24:54.694 --> 24:55.862
Mademoiselle.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.703
Did you tear
through the henhouse already?

25:37.703 --> 25:40.239
And have you miss
all the delicious details?

25:42.742 --> 25:44.043
<i>Do you see the ship?</i>

25:44.043 --> 25:45.978
<i>That is Eloise de Chalon.</i>

25:45.978 --> 25:48.147
Her husband is impotent.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.616
As, I'm sure, are half
the men in this room.

25:50.616 --> 25:51.884
<i>Doesn't it make you wonder</i>

25:51.884 --> 25:53.786
<i>where her son came from,</i>

25:53.786 --> 25:57.957
the son that will inherit
all the Chalon fortune?

25:57.957 --> 26:01.060
<i>She also has
uncommonly sensitive lips...</i>

26:01.060 --> 26:03.763
not the ones you speak with.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.998
<i>You see the woman
in the butterfly mask?</i>

26:05.998 --> 26:07.733
<i>The Chancellor's wife?</i>

26:07.733 --> 26:09.235
There's no secrets on him.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.671
I should know; I've tried
hard enough to find one.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.005
She has two lovers.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.942
I know the first,
a louche Parisienne.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.344
The other
is from the English court.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.213
You may thank me
with an engagement ring.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.816
If it were anything but gossip.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.986
I have written proof
of all these secrets,

26:26.986 --> 26:29.889
<i>private letters
I have intercepted.</i>

26:29.889 --> 26:32.591
All these letters will be yours
when we marry.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.161
Consider them
my wedding gift to you.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.237
<i>Honored guests,</i>

26:45.237 --> 26:48.708
good evening to you all,

26:48.708 --> 26:51.143
you, the most beautiful people

26:51.143 --> 26:53.279
<i>in all of France.</i>

26:53.279 --> 26:55.948
<i>This evening,
I take this opportunity</i>

26:55.948 --> 26:59.785
to perform an excerpt
of my new opera...

27:01.754 --> 27:04.023
<i>...dedicated to our queen,</i>

27:04.023 --> 27:05.624
wherever she may be.

27:26.712 --> 27:28.047
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

27:58.377 --> 27:59.745
Your name, monsieur?

27:59.745 --> 28:01.113
Monsieur Lucienne.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.355
I'm a guest
of Monsieur de Montrachet.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.760
Get your hands off me.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.896
- We're with the dog.
- Off you go.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.367
Come.
Let's find another way.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.971
Monsieur.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.156
Theo.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.758
Pascal.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.226
Not tonight, my friend.

28:47.226 --> 28:50.262
I'm in disguise in name
as well as mask.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.897
I heard your music.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.899
What are you worried about?

28:53.899 --> 28:56.402
It's magnificent.
Your opera will be a success.

28:56.402 --> 28:59.071
I have every note
written and rehearsed.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.406
Even I am transfixed.

29:00.406 --> 29:03.275
But the-the story,

29:03.275 --> 29:05.845
the queen has torn
through every version--

29:05.845 --> 29:07.880
not modern enough,
not female enough,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.815
not surprising enough,

29:09.815 --> 29:12.852
Which in itself is no surprise,
given my librettist is so old,

29:12.852 --> 29:14.019
he served our last king.

29:17.156 --> 29:20.426
I need a story for our times.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.332
Come to my place
tomorrow night.

29:26.332 --> 29:28.434
I'll give you a story.

29:28.434 --> 29:32.238
But now...
I need to find a lamb.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.874
Have you seen one?

29:37.409 --> 29:39.278
There you are, my dear.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.548
She moves as if
being led to the slaughter.

29:49.421 --> 29:50.456
She may well be.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.106
<i>Dance with me, mademoiselle.</i>

30:07.106 --> 30:08.941
<i>Very well.</i>

30:17.116 --> 30:18.317
Thank you, Jacqueline.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.120
It is so important
you are by my side tonight,

30:21.120 --> 30:23.055
that we appear in good spirits.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.960
I know all of this offends you.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.597
I know my ambition
offends you also.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.134
But I hope my gratitude
does not.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.273
I'm not offended. I'm bored.

30:58.991 --> 31:01.293
Your hand is cold,
Madame de Montrachet.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.965
Let me warm it.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.872
You prayed on it.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.207
Yes.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.112
Excuse me.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.313
One more dance, ma'am.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.148
Monsieur, please.

31:32.958 --> 31:36.328
Monsieur de Montrachet.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.430
Do we know one another?

31:38.430 --> 31:40.633
No, but we should.

31:40.633 --> 31:43.135
I know you by reputation:

31:43.135 --> 31:46.205
the most talented
surgeon in Paris.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.277
Your hands, in fact,

31:51.277 --> 31:54.613
have a reputation
all of their own.

31:55.681 --> 31:57.349
And you are?

32:03.522 --> 32:05.257
An admirer.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.593
The Vicomtesse de Valmont.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.528
The Widow de Valmont.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.265
Call on me.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.488
We must find somewhere to talk.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.478
Jacqueline.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.012
Lucienne.

33:34.012 --> 33:37.049
I'm, uh--I'm trembling.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.370
There is someone here.

34:04.309 --> 34:06.278
<i>Oh, no.</i>

34:06.278 --> 34:07.379
<i>I did not mean
to bring you here.</i>

34:07.379 --> 34:08.614
I am so sorry.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.352
Forgive me for what I want.

34:22.528 --> 34:25.431
I have prayed God intercede,
but He has not.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.099
Stop.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.700
Jacqueline, please.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.403
You are too good a woman

34:31.403 --> 34:32.604
to fall to a man like me.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.448
Wait.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.088
Jacqueline, please.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.790
I care for you too much.

34:53.292 --> 34:56.328
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

34:56.328 --> 34:58.163
It is a mortal sin.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.474
<i>Jacqueline...</i>

35:08.474 --> 35:09.708
come.

35:11.176 --> 35:13.545
Let me take you
from this debauched place.

35:15.581 --> 35:16.849
Come.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.454
Little fox,
your fur is getting matted.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.391
<i>Do you remember Christine
last year</i>

35:59.391 --> 36:01.159
<i>when she fell while dancing</i>

36:01.159 --> 36:02.528
and got up laughing?

36:02.528 --> 36:05.197
She was completely shameless,

36:05.197 --> 36:06.532
certainly in her ambition

36:06.532 --> 36:10.235
and... in other things too,
so I hear.

36:11.537 --> 36:14.840
I wonder how Jean
discovered her affair.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.342
Where is your new fiancé,
Camille?

36:17.342 --> 36:19.578
- Who are you marrying?
- The Marquis de Merteuil.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.580
The ward becomes the wife.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.382
How does that happen, I wonder?

36:23.382 --> 36:24.950
True love.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.685
Perhaps some air,
Mademoiselle Camille?

36:26.685 --> 36:29.454
How convenient
that anyone in the way

36:29.454 --> 36:31.690
of your advantageous marriage

36:31.690 --> 36:33.926
dies or goes to ruin.

36:33.926 --> 36:38.297
Does Jean know
his bride is so lethal?

36:38.297 --> 36:39.631
<i>Let's warn him.</i>

36:39.631 --> 36:41.767
In fact, let's warn everyone.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.802
<i>Has anybody here
seen the queen?</i>

36:43.802 --> 36:47.372
I hear whispers
she's here already.

36:47.372 --> 36:50.242
I have something
delicious to tell.

36:50.242 --> 36:53.979
The Montrachets are leaving
for Versailles this week.

36:54.212 --> 36:58.550
Henri is to be appointed
royal physician to the king.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.788
<i>He will have so much sway.</i>

37:02.788 --> 37:06.224
<i>When Monsieur de Montrachet
has the king's ear,</i>

37:06.224 --> 37:09.595
he will be able to have
whatever he wants.

37:11.296 --> 37:12.898
<i>Whatever he wants.</i>

38:08.720 --> 38:10.689
Camille, Camille,
please, stop this.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.858
- Come away.
- Victoire, go home.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.793
- I need to finish this.
- Valmont says there's something

38:14.793 --> 38:16.895
between you and Jacqueline
de Montrachet's husband.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.398
And you believe him?

38:19.398 --> 38:20.499
What am I supposed to believe

38:20.499 --> 38:21.566
if you won't tell me the truth?

38:21.566 --> 38:23.435
<i>You're scaring me, Camille.</i>

38:23.435 --> 38:24.736
If you are scared, go.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.071
I have no further need
of you tonight.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.674
Don't treat me like a servant.

38:28.674 --> 38:29.841
I'm your friend.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.544
Every day,
I've watched over you.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.746
I have done everything
to keep you safe.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.615
I have sold myself
so you did not have to.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.684
I was never for sale.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.986
But you sell yourself
over and over again!

38:40.986 --> 38:42.988
No servant
speaks to me that way.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.023
Go home, Victoire!

39:55.961 --> 39:59.698
<i>The Montrachets
are leaving for Versailles.</i>

39:59.698 --> 40:03.735
<i>Does Jean know
his bride is so lethal?</i>

40:05.670 --> 40:07.739
<i>When Monsieur de
Montrachet has the king's ear,</i>

40:07.739 --> 40:10.876
<i>he will be able to have
whatever he wants.</i>

40:15.781 --> 40:17.616
Henri de Montrachet!

40:19.718 --> 40:21.853
I'm the girl you raped

40:21.853 --> 40:23.989
and threw in the gutter
like I was nothing.

40:23.989 --> 40:26.558
I'm not nothing now.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.000
Pascal.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.005
I almost cut you.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.009
Why didn't you stop me?

40:44.009 --> 40:48.046
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.981
I'm sorry.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.683
Come.

41:06.631 --> 41:07.833
Tell me.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.473
Tell me what happened, please.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.955
They took me in...

41:31.923 --> 41:35.794
...the good, fine Montrachets.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.835
I was so innocent.

41:43.835 --> 41:48.573
<i>And he was so kind...
at first,</i>

41:48.573 --> 41:50.976
<i>but it was a lie.</i>

41:53.979 --> 41:56.648
He came into my room.

42:23.775 --> 42:26.011
He made me swear
I would not tell.

42:30.815 --> 42:33.084
She could see I was with child.

42:33.084 --> 42:38.056
<i>And she dismissed
the stable hand,</i>

42:38.056 --> 42:41.026
<i>even though I told her
the truth...</i>

42:42.093 --> 42:44.696
...that it was her husband's,

42:44.696 --> 42:46.865
and that he forced me.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.001
<i>And they kept me
out of sight...</i>

42:51.569 --> 42:54.706
...with this thing
growing inside of me.

42:57.709 --> 42:59.577
And I wanted it to die...

43:02.580 --> 43:04.816
...as I wanted to die

43:04.816 --> 43:06.885
<i>for what he'd done.</i>

43:12.057 --> 43:14.225
But then I felt her...

43:19.097 --> 43:21.599
...her skin on mine.

43:26.104 --> 43:29.074
Then I saw her eyes.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.916
And I knew she was innocent...

43:40.685 --> 43:43.355
...and that I wanted her
to be mine forever.

43:50.195 --> 43:53.098
But I was tired, and I...

43:56.334 --> 43:58.370
<i>...I fell asleep.</i>

44:09.080 --> 44:12.283
I shouldn't have fallen asleep.

44:15.053 --> 44:17.722
<i>She wasn't strong,</i>

44:17.722 --> 44:20.125
<i>but she was mine.</i>

44:24.829 --> 44:27.332
They didn't let me bury her.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.343
Even God does not forgive.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.952
<i>I had nowhere to go.</i>

45:02.133 --> 45:05.170
<i>And they left me for dead.</i>

45:20.051 --> 45:21.986
I will cut his throat.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.357
No.

45:28.393 --> 45:32.263
I want to ruin them
the way they've ruined me.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.201
Tonight I thought
I was powerful enough

45:36.201 --> 45:37.936
to vanquish him.

45:40.772 --> 45:43.007
And then he became
the king's man.

45:45.043 --> 45:46.878
And I will not fail you.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.349
I'll destroy her...

45:51.349 --> 45:53.184
destroy them both.

45:53.184 --> 45:55.253
Don't go back inside.

45:57.122 --> 45:59.224
Don't go near those people.

46:02.227 --> 46:04.195
Go back to Saint-Honoré.

46:04.195 --> 46:07.065
Then come to me tomorrow.

46:07.065 --> 46:09.434
I'll make a good life for us.

46:10.835 --> 46:12.237
I promise you.

46:16.307 --> 46:17.842
I love you.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.046
I'm yours.

46:23.515 --> 46:25.884
I'm yours.

46:25.884 --> 46:27.418
Camille

47:23.208 --> 47:25.143
Camille, where are you?

47:26.511 --> 47:28.279
<i>Camille!</i>

47:55.240 --> 47:56.441
Are you unwell?

47:59.877 --> 48:01.980
Do you ever have this feeling

48:01.980 --> 48:06.317
as if you cannot seem
to draw quite enough breath?

48:06.317 --> 48:07.619
<i>Often.</i>

48:07.619 --> 48:10.455
I believe
it is called a corset.

48:10.455 --> 48:12.590
Do you need help
loosening yours?

48:13.891 --> 48:17.195
It is not the corset.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.302
I think it is...

48:24.302 --> 48:26.537
when there is too much feeling.

48:30.441 --> 48:32.910
I lost a friend quite recently.

48:34.646 --> 48:38.082
She... broke my heart

48:38.082 --> 48:39.684
with her betrayal...

48:41.386 --> 48:45.456
...but the pain of her absence
is worse.

48:47.959 --> 48:51.696
I keep imagining I see her,
but it's not her.

48:53.431 --> 48:58.403
I must, of course, act as if
I am not at all affected.

48:58.403 --> 49:01.306
That is my great challenge.

49:02.240 --> 49:06.978
If you are in pain, it is
because you have loved fully.

49:09.547 --> 49:11.716
I have loved fully.

49:13.217 --> 49:16.387
I know this much to be true.

49:16.387 --> 49:19.390
You will love
and be loved again.

49:58.429 --> 50:01.366
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

50:01.366 --> 50:06.337
<i>eight, seven, six,</i>

50:06.337 --> 50:09.340
five, four,

50:09.340 --> 50:12.777
- three, two, one!
- Your Majesty.

52:31.315 --> 52:32.583
Victoire!

52:39.190 --> 52:41.192
Victoire.

52:41.192 --> 52:43.227
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

52:43.227 --> 52:45.229
I'm sorry.

53:07.685 --> 53:09.587
<i>My dear Camille,</i>

53:09.587 --> 53:12.623
<i>I never dreamed I would miss
our old world,</i>

53:12.623 --> 53:14.926
<i>our old lives.</i>

53:14.926 --> 53:17.395
<i>But I knew who you were then:</i>

53:17.395 --> 53:19.764
<i>my friend, as I was yours.</i>

53:19.764 --> 53:21.632
<i>Now I see
that I must find my own way</i>

53:21.632 --> 53:24.702
<i>and that we're on
different paths.</i>

53:24.702 --> 53:27.772
<i>So know that I will
always love you.</i>

53:27.772 --> 53:30.675
<i>But do not come looking for me</i>

53:30.675 --> 53:32.877
<i>or the letters I have taken.</i>

53:32.877 --> 53:36.213
<i>I will destroy them
before they destroy you.</i>

53:36.213 --> 53:37.748
<i>Yours, Victoire.</i>

54:05.676 --> 54:06.877
I couldn't find you.

54:14.352 --> 54:15.886
You're not my equal.

54:19.790 --> 54:22.893
I'm relieved
to hear you say it.

54:25.329 --> 54:26.564
I wanted to talk to you too.

54:26.564 --> 54:27.999
You're more than my equal.

54:29.967 --> 54:32.670
The feeling when I
couldn't find you, Camille...

54:33.938 --> 54:36.707
I don't want to be without you.

54:47.618 --> 54:49.887
Marry me.
