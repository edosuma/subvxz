Looks to be strangled, too.

Doesn’t look like a robbery
from what they left behind.

in the apartment?

01:17.702 --> 01:19.704
Miss Wyatt was supposed to get
the windows washed today.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.790
Last time, they made a mess,
so I promised her

01:21.873 --> 01:23.500
I would personally move the orchids
away from the windows,

01:23.625 --> 01:24.834
and put the birds in a safe place.

-That’s what I came up to do.
-What do you know about her?

01:28.004 --> 01:31.633
Very nice person, generous, considerate.
I liked her... I liked her a lot.

You know what she did for a living?

who knows what now, right?

01:36.221 --> 01:38.181
-She was a hooker.
-How’d you know that?

Not really.

There was one who was here a lot.

01:49.984 --> 01:53.238

in a black Mercedes.

-Gray hair, kind of big.

Could've been a banker or lawyer.
Never said but two words to me.

Duffy didn’t change his mind,

from Medavoy’s night.

-Yep.

-No, huh?

I’m not sure any of us can.

and I would appreciate
her not finding out about it.

to the relationship.

-But it was her birthday,

07:10.138 --> 07:13.266
and I bought her a small,
fairly insignificant gift.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.476
Did you know if she was seeing
anybody else?

07:15.560 --> 07:19.522
Well, not to put too fine a point on it,
but Pamela was a prostitute.

07:19.772 --> 07:22.775
She was discriminating to a degree,
she was expensive.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.612

periodically proclaiming

07:26.696 --> 07:29.657
her intention to get out of that life,
that is what she was.

then tell him the details. I hated him.

who they may have had threesomes with?

11:44.161 --> 11:46.372
Her name was Anne Marie.
I don’t know her last name.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.332
Any idea where we can find her?

11:48.666 --> 11:52.044
No. I know she’s lying low
ever since she got busted.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.337
What did she get busted for?

11:53.713 --> 11:56.173
She propositioned a cop
outside the Mercer Hotel.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.050
(CHUCKLES) It’s funny, you know,

11:58.467 --> 12:00.970
Pamela wanted to keep that part
of her life such a secret.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.764
At the same time,
she wanted me to know all about it.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.226
I think when I moved back into the city,
she realized how...

12:08.686 --> 12:10.396
how much she wanted to have a sister.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.942
(SOBS, SNIFFLES) Um... excuse me.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.039
All right, thanks. That was Ortiz.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.583
The sister gave the name of a pross,

12:30.666 --> 12:33.169
who used to have threesomes
with the DOA and Heilbrenner.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.045
-He’s a regular rock star, this guy.
-BALDWIN: Yeah.

There’s no last name,
but the first name’s Anne Marie,

12:37.715 --> 12:39.633
and she took a collar in the 5th Precinct
sometime last month.

a ride out there,

-Yeah.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.459
Where’d you drive him?

13:14.168 --> 13:17.421
Well, I picked up Mrs. Heilbrenner
at around a quarter to eight,

13:17.630 --> 13:20.382
drove her to Le Bernardin
on West 51st Street,

13:20.633 --> 13:22.885
waited outside the restaurant
till probably 9:30.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.094
And when they both came out,

13:24.178 --> 13:27.640
I drove them to their apartment
on 5th Avenue and 76th Street.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.809
What time did you pick up
Mr. Heilbrenner this morning?

13:30.309 --> 13:31.936
Seven, 7:15.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.813
Let’s talk about Pamela Wyatt.

-She and Mr. Heilbrenner get along?
-Yeah.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.318
-No arguments?
-None that I saw.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.111
I mean, I’m not supposed to pay
too close attention

13:41.195 --> 13:42.530
to what’s going on in the back seat,

13:42.613 --> 13:45.241
but from what I could tell,
they were usually holding hands,

13:45.324 --> 13:48.118
whispering to each other, they were...
they were like a couple on a date.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.080
-Did you ever drive Pamela by yourself?
-A few times.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.332
-RAY: She ever call you?
-He would.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.042
Why would he do that?

13:56.752 --> 13:58.963
When Mr. Heilbrenner called me
to pick her up,

13:59.046 --> 14:01.048
it was because she was messed up on dope,

14:01.131 --> 14:03.384
and he just wanted to make sure
she got home safe.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.804
-Where would you pick her up from?
-DALE: Restaurants, bars.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.430
Did she ever indicate,
when you’d pick her up,

14:08.556 --> 14:10.724
where she was getting the dope from
or who she might have been with?

14:10.808 --> 14:14.353
No, she’d just thank me,
curl up under her coat and go to sleep.

about him, Anne Marie.

that's what I need to do.

but at a certain point,

15:24.924 --> 15:26.675
He got nastier with the things
he was saying,

15:26.842 --> 15:28.260
and he started whipping us harder.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.137
Hard enough so we started bleeding.

There was a time when I think
she was in love with him.

15:38.395 --> 15:42.274
Or... maybe just in love with the things
he could provide for her.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.110
She told me that he was gonna
leave his wife for her.

he’s not the type of guy that does that."

She said, "No, Anne Marie you’re wrong.

-And then he dumped her.
-Why was that?

to divorce him.

She kissed him and then proceeded to spend
about 20,000 dollars of our money

22:28.889 --> 22:32.225
-on outfits for herself.
-Did you confront him?

22:32.351 --> 22:35.395
I did. I told him either he broke off
all relations with her

22:35.520 --> 22:37.022
or I would divorce him.

22:37.314 --> 22:38.440
What was his response?

22:38.648 --> 22:41.109
You know, at first,
he broke down and cried,

22:41.360 --> 22:44.363
told me how worthless he felt,
how much he was afraid of dying.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.782
He was hoping I’d say,
"It’s all right, Robert.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.034
"You can have your Pamela. I’ll be fine."

22:49.576 --> 22:50.660
You didn’t do that.

22:51.119 --> 22:53.038
-Would you?
-No, ma’am.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.832
I told him I’d lined up a lawyer
and a forensic accountant

22:56.124 --> 22:59.252
and was prepared to start going over
the books the next morning at nine a.m.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.380
-He promised to get rid of her?
-Right.

23:02.005 --> 23:04.174
-Did he make good on that?
-I believe he did.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.760
-Because he said so?
-Because I watched the money.

23:06.968 --> 23:10.389
A girl like this doesn’t hang around
to be thrown 1,000 dollars now and then.

23:10.680 --> 23:14.601
Kind of money she costs,
I’d know if he were coming up with it.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.978
-Did he ever hit you?
-Never.

23:17.187 --> 23:20.607
Did he ever get rough with you
as a means to stimulate himself sexually?

23:20.857 --> 23:22.025
My God! No!

23:22.275 --> 23:25.737
I would never be party to such behavior,
number one, number two,

23:25.821 --> 23:29.366
it’s not something that would serve
as stimulation for him. He'd abort.

23:30.033 --> 23:32.577
That’s not necessarily
the information we’ve been getting.

23:32.702 --> 23:36.039
I suggest you check carefully
the sources of that information.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.458
My husband is a very wealthy man,

23:38.667 --> 23:41.294
who a great many people
would like to take advantage of.

23:41.586 --> 23:45.882
I promise you, I will not stand idly by
while his name is sullied.

23:55.225 --> 23:57.727
-Sipowicz?
-Yes, sir, chief.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.480
-In your office.
-Why don’t we just go down here?

24:00.605 --> 24:03.817
The office is still in the process
of getting moved into.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.402
DUFFY: Fine.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.078
-What the hell are you doing?
-What do you mean?

24:15.287 --> 24:16.705
You got a confession on this homicide

24:16.788 --> 24:18.165
why are your detectives
still working the case?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.126
I think they felt there were questions
about the legitimacy of the confession.

24:21.418 --> 24:24.713
Are you kidding me? It’s done.
The perp was a client of the DOA.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.173
You were looking at him
before he confessed.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.300
Now, you got a statement
with all kinds of details that he did it.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.427
But because he’s got diplomatic immunity,

24:30.510 --> 24:33.221
the consequences of a false confession
are a lot less.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.390
Sergeant, that’s not your business.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.143
You had an inspector
from police intelligence

24:38.226 --> 24:42.230
and an FBI agent go over that confession.
They were satisfied, it was legitimate.

24:42.397 --> 24:44.232
Now You’re telling me,
’cause you got a hard-on

24:44.441 --> 24:46.026
to lock somebody up,
you got people out there

24:46.276 --> 24:49.613
-bothering Robert Heilbrenner’s wife?
-We want to be sure we got the right guy.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.616
We got the right guy.
You heard it from me.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.243
Now, this investigation is over.
Is that understood?

24:56.453 --> 24:57.996
-Understood.
-Good.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.184
JOHN: Well, we appreciate you coming in,
Mr. Nikada.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.603
We want to talk to you about your nephew.

25:22.395 --> 25:24.564
-What is there to talk about?
-Were you close to him?

25:24.731 --> 25:25.774
He was my family.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.442
Were you aware
of his frequenting prostitutes?

25:28.193 --> 25:29.194
No.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.531
Were you aware of his ever having
behaved violently towards women?

25:32.614 --> 25:34.407
-No.
-What about gambling?

25:34.491 --> 25:36.826
My nephew was an outstanding student
in Japan.

25:37.619 --> 25:41.122
He received a graduate degree
from London School of Economics.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.500
He had a trusted position
with the Japanese mission

25:43.625 --> 25:45.043
to the United Nations.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.546
He’s always been a considerate
and respectful nephew.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.131
-Did he gamble?
-He has confessed to murder.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.591
What does it matter if he gambled?

25:51.883 --> 25:53.426
It may have something to do
with why he confessed.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.763
We’re not convinced he actually did
what he confessed to doing.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.224
Why would he have confessed, then?

25:59.891 --> 26:02.269
Why would he have brought
this kind of shame on his family?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.854
Mr. Nikada, did your nephew
have gambling debts?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.399
That’s not something
he would discuss with me.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.776
-Not after the last time.
-The last time for what?

26:10.735 --> 26:13.321
He owed a man money
from having bet on horse races.

26:14.114 --> 26:17.158
He was afraid if he did not pay him
that he would get hurt,

26:17.242 --> 26:19.452
that the man would cause him
embarrassment at work.

26:20.704 --> 26:24.124
-Thirty-five thousand dollars, I paid.
-Who was the man?

26:25.375 --> 26:27.252
I only knew him as Mr. Seigal.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.921
Howard Seigal?
Takes book in the back of a dry cleaners?

26:30.547 --> 26:31.590
Yes.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.426
I used to have the foot post
where that dry cleaner’s is.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.095
Does the name Robert Heilbrenner
mean anything to you?

26:37.262 --> 26:39.764
My nephew introduced me to him
at a restaurant one time.

26:39.889 --> 26:40.974
What’d he tell you about him?

26:41.099 --> 26:43.852
He told me that he was a powerful
and influential man,

26:44.477 --> 26:46.813
that he might one day take
his diplomatic experience

26:46.896 --> 26:48.940
and go to work for him.

-How you doing, John?
-JOHN IRVIN: Great.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.408
-Hey, Greg!
-I was just showing an apartment

26:58.533 --> 27:00.118
in the neighborhood.
I thought I’d stop by.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.787
Why you didn’t waste any time
getting started with the new job,

27:02.871 --> 27:04.372
-did you?
-No, I didn’t.

27:04.539 --> 27:05.749
Hey, Medavoy, how’s it going?

27:06.666 --> 27:09.753
-Aren’t you going back downstairs?
-Andy’s the new squad commander.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.675
-That’s great, Andy. Well deserved.
-Thanks.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.927
-Hey, look who’s here.
-Hey, buddy.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.471
Hey, partner.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.641
It turns out Nikada has a history
of going in the hole

27:22.766 --> 27:24.351
-for betting the ponies.
-ANDY: Who was he betting with?

27:24.476 --> 27:27.020
Howard Seigal’s the bookie.
His uncle bailed him out with last time.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.023
But he also told us that
Nikada knew Heilbrenner.

27:30.607 --> 27:34.319
Go talk to Heilbrenner’s driver again.
See how committed he is to that alibi.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.906
Why don't you guys go talk to the bookie.
Find out if that marker’s been paid.

27:40.575 --> 27:42.577
-You guys just transferred in?
-Yeah.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.413
Yeah, well, stick with this guy.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.207
He’ll tell you everything
you need to know.

27:47.666 --> 27:49.668
It’s good to see you, buddy.
I’m sorry, I got to run.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.503
-All right? I’ll talk to you later.
-GREG: Yeah.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.675
-Squad commander.
-ANDY: Yeah.

any cars registered to him

28:01.763 --> 28:02.972
or members of his family.

-Medavoy, I got to run downstairs.
-Yeah, okay. Go ahead, go ahead.

about Johnny Nikada, Howard?

I can tell you anything?

We don’t care about bookmaking.

Except that if you’re gonna lie to us,
we’ll be all over you.

There’s a bunch of young cops in vice

They’ll make your life miserable
for the next five years.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.028
This stays between us?

28:59.404 --> 29:00.780
As long as you had nothing to do
with the homicide.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.658
-What do you want to know about him?
-Did he put down for a bet or two?

29:04.492 --> 29:08.037
The Japanese bet bicycle races.
They bet motorboat races.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.749
Forget about it when they get their noses
open with horses.

29:10.957 --> 29:13.418
-This guy was crazy even for them.
-What was he into you for?

29:14.252 --> 29:15.545
Hundred and ten thousand.

29:16.087 --> 29:20.175
Six months ago, he hit the trifecta
at Arlington. Paid 27-1.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.302
He walked away with 40,000 dollars.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.637
And believe me,
I was only too happy to pay him.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.431
’Cause then he started to lose.

29:27.348 --> 29:30.226
And this after having to get bailed out
by his uncle first time.

29:30.435 --> 29:31.770
How hard you lean on him?

What am I gonna do?
It’s not a student loan.

29:33.813 --> 29:37.025
I told him it’s serious number
and he has to make restitution.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.902
-Did he?
-Just today.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.030
He came in with 110,000 cash
just before noon.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.289
-Thanks, Oscar.
-Anytime.

Hey, where you going?

-DALE: What?
-We want to talk to you.

-Where are the other guys?
-They’re tied up.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.089
They already talked to me though.

30:00.298 --> 30:02.258
Yeah, we just got to straighten out
a couple details.

30:02.550 --> 30:05.386
-I’m working now, guys.
-Oh, why? Is he coming down now?

30:05.720 --> 30:08.515
No, I just got to get the car washed,
got to get gas.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.683
Mr. Heilbrenner
needs me back here at 6:30.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.228
He and his wife have
a formal affair to attend.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.896
Oh! We’ll have you back by then.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.357
-I got a choice?
-No, not really.

30:18.399 --> 30:21.402
-Want me to follow you?
-How about you let me chauffeur you?

30:22.946 --> 30:23.947
Get in.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.744
-I like this.
-Yeah, I bet you do.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.672
Ever know Heilbrenner
to go at girls a little hard?

30:40.922 --> 30:42.841
-Smack them around a little bit?
-Hey, I'm his driver,

30:42.966 --> 30:45.218
-I didn’t double-date with the guy.
-We know that he did.

30:45.301 --> 30:47.178
Different strokes
for different folks, right?

30:47.387 --> 30:48.847
He used to whip Pamela with his belt.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.850
Well, I told those other guys the two
of them seemed to be into each other.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.686
So, whatever he did,
he couldn’t have been hurting her too bad.

30:54.894 --> 30:58.147
-Mrs. Heilbrenner found out about Pamela.
-I don’t know anything about that.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.816
She and her husband
never had it out in the car?

31:00.108 --> 31:02.735
Like I told the other guys,
I try not to pay attention

31:02.861 --> 31:04.153
to what’s going on in the back seat.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.322
You see Dale, here’s the thing.

31:08.324 --> 31:12.328
Heilbrenner pays you a good salary,
probably takes care of your family,

31:12.537 --> 31:14.455
and you want to be a loyal employee
to him and that's fine.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.374
But the problem is,
we think that he killed this girl,

31:16.457 --> 31:17.542
and you’re helping him cover it up.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.169
JOHN: That takes it way beyond
being a loyal employee, Dale.

31:20.461 --> 31:23.381
That puts it under the heading
"accessory after the fact."

31:23.673 --> 31:25.174
I don’t know what you guys
are talking about.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.509
You know what,
"accessory after the fact" means, Dale?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.803
That means you go to prison
along with him.

31:29.304 --> 31:30.638
Now, the decision you have to make

31:30.722 --> 31:32.682
is whether or not you’re gonna
get taken down with him.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.687
No, I don’t need this.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.190
I mean, I got a wife, I got a kid,

31:41.691 --> 31:43.776
I got another one on the way,
and I don’t need this.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.361
Tell us what happened.

31:48.072 --> 31:51.993
I get a phone call
around four o'clock in the morning.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.120
He was at her apartment.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.831
He told me to be downstairs
as fast as I could get there.

31:56.998 --> 31:58.666
When he came out of the building,
I could see right away

31:58.750 --> 32:00.335
-that something was wrong.
-Why?

32:00.627 --> 32:02.629
'Cause he was white and shaking.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.173
He told me to take him to his office,

32:05.673 --> 32:07.383
and go upstairs
to get him a change of clothes

32:07.467 --> 32:09.969
-while he waited in the car.
-Why did he need a change of clothes?

32:10.345 --> 32:12.555
I could see in the mirror
that he had blood on him.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.516
And he told you what to say
when you were questioned?

32:15.892 --> 32:19.145
He said he was gonna
take care of me for life...

32:20.063 --> 32:21.356
Me and my family.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.484
I told him I didn’t know what happened
in the apartment,

32:25.443 --> 32:26.945
but it bothered me to lie like that.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.864
He said, "What happened in the apartment
was an accident."

32:29.989 --> 32:32.033
-Why didn’t he say it was an accident?
-I asked him that.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.828
He said people wouldn’t understand.

32:36.412 --> 32:38.206
We’re gonna need to take
a statement from you.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.668
Yeah, well, whatever you got to do.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.838
I keep seeing that girl’s face
every time I close my eyes.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.759
I don’t want to see it no more.

33:03.856 --> 33:05.149
What’s going on?

33:05.858 --> 33:07.902
Mr. Heilbrenner,
we’re placing you under arrest

33:08.027 --> 33:09.404
for the murder of Pamela Wyatt.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.531
-You must be kidding.
-We’re not.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.492
What is it? Someone down at the department
has a vendetta against me

33:14.993 --> 33:16.536
that I don’t know anything about?

33:16.786 --> 33:19.247
If you cooperate with us,
we’ll put the handcuffs in front,

33:19.330 --> 33:22.625
-so you can cover them with your coat.
-You are not cuffing me anywhere, dear.

33:22.750 --> 33:25.336
Yeah, we are. This time,
the handcuffs are going on you.

33:25.503 --> 33:29.465
I am going to have my lawyer down here
in about 30 seconds flat.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.467
Your lawyer can meet us at the precinct.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.386
What’s going on?

33:33.803 --> 33:36.222
These idiots, they think
they’re going to arrest me!

33:36.514 --> 33:38.349
-For what?
-Your husband can tell you.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.144
Like Detective Ortiz said,
we’re willing to put them on the front.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.146
give us a hard time,
they’re going on the back.

33:43.479 --> 33:45.189
I don’t understand
what’s going on, Robert.

33:45.356 --> 33:48.401
You... just call Greenhouse.
Tell him to meet me...

33:48.568 --> 33:49.986
-Where are we going?
-LAURA: Fifteenth Precinct.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.031
I want to know
what you’re arresting him for.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.033
For the murder of the girl, Felicia.

33:55.908 --> 33:58.161
I... I thought someone
already confessed to that.

33:58.619 --> 33:59.704
Someone did.

34:12.341 --> 34:13.634
-Hi, lieutenant.
-John.

34:14.218 --> 34:17.096
-How are you feeling?
-Well enough to gather up my things.

34:17.221 --> 34:20.475
-Can I help you?
-It’s all right. I’d rather do it myself.

34:29.859 --> 34:32.153
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

34:33.446 --> 34:34.447
He’s here.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.491
Hey, sergeant.

34:36.616 --> 34:39.660
-Are you all right, Bob?
-I’m fine, Basil. Just take care of it.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.705
-I’d like to see my client alone.
-You gonna allow him to give a statement?

34:42.914 --> 34:43.956
(SCOFFS) You got to be kidding.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.666
In that case, you can meet him in court.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.586
Hey, you’re not gonna
give them five minutes?

34:48.669 --> 34:51.464
Not now. You want, you can get it
on record with the desk officer

34:51.547 --> 34:52.673
that you were here.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.726
-We’ll start with the fives.
-All right.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.110
You put him in handcuffs
in front of his wife?

35:12.276 --> 35:13.277
We had no choice.

35:13.402 --> 35:15.321
No? How about picking up the phone
and calling me?

35:15.613 --> 35:18.199
-What about letting me bring him in?
-What do I do When he jumps on the plane,

35:18.282 --> 35:20.827
he keeps out at Teterboro
and skips down to Costa Rica?

35:21.911 --> 35:25.540
You could have had me as a friend.
Instead, you have me as an enemy.

35:26.582 --> 35:29.043
And for what? A dead pross.

35:29.585 --> 35:33.047
Whatever it is you’re gonna do
to me, chief, right now I got work to do.

35:38.928 --> 35:42.181
-How you feeling, lieutenant?
-Not bad. How are you feeling?

35:44.517 --> 35:45.518
In the office.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.408
When I was in earlier today,
what did I tell you I wanted done?

36:00.533 --> 36:02.326
ANDY: There were some loose ends
in the investigation

36:02.410 --> 36:03.870
-that had to be run down.
-DUFFY: Answer the question!

36:04.036 --> 36:06.122
-What did I tell you to do?
-ANDY: Close the case.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.415
DUFFY: You do it?

36:07.540 --> 36:09.709
ANDY: We were getting information
I thought was worth pursuing.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.043
DUFFY: Did you call me
and let me know that?

36:11.169 --> 36:12.795
-ANDY: No, sir.
-DUFFY: Did you call the Borough?

36:12.879 --> 36:14.255
-ANDY: No sir.
-DUFFY: Did you call anybody

36:14.338 --> 36:16.716
in the off chance
I may find out what’s going on?

36:17.008 --> 36:19.552
Things were jumping off fast pretty fast,
I hadn’t gotten to it yet.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.970
Oh, you hadn't got into it yet.

36:21.095 --> 36:22.722
Letting me know
is the first thing you get to!

36:22.889 --> 36:24.724
With all due respect, sir, I told you

36:24.974 --> 36:27.935
I thought that there were questions
about the legitimacy of the confession.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.646
DUFFY: Did you make your case to me
about what those questions were?

36:30.897 --> 36:31.981
-I tried.
-DUFFY: You tried.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.734
That's right, and since I didn’t appear
to be getting anywhere,

36:34.901 --> 36:38.404
I decided to continue
the investigation on my own initiative.

36:38.487 --> 36:42.450
I’m sorry, but I think my first obligation
was to work the case

36:42.825 --> 36:44.827
according to the evidence
that we were coming up with.

36:45.161 --> 36:48.164
No, your first obligation
is to make sure I don’t find out

36:48.247 --> 36:50.166
what happens in my command
on the six o'clock news!

36:50.333 --> 36:52.293
-You get that, sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.171
Now, I put you in this job.
Already, I regret it.

36:55.838 --> 36:58.007
You embarrass me again,
you’re gonna regret it.

37:19.695 --> 37:22.073
(SIGHS) CompStat files are on the shelf.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.370
-When are we up for review?
-A week from tomorrow.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.461
Thinking about taking a foot post
in the midtown tunnel?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.841
It’s a shaky perch you’re on, sergeant.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.219
You have to answer
to the people above you,

37:43.928 --> 37:45.513
look after the people below you,

37:46.722 --> 37:48.349
and you have to be able to live
with yourself.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.226
What are my chances?

37:50.893 --> 37:53.062
As far as the last two go,
I’d say they’re decent.

37:54.772 --> 37:55.898
Good luck with the first one.

38:01.821 --> 38:02.863
Thanks.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.667
It’s all yours.

38:34.061 --> 38:35.646
-We’re leaving now, sarge.
-Okay.

38:36.522 --> 38:38.107
We’re sorry if we loused anything up.

38:38.983 --> 38:40.860
Don’t worry about it.
Everything came out fine.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.820
Not exactly thanks to us.

38:43.404 --> 38:46.449
You’re gonna make good detectives, guys.
Give yourselves time.

38:47.533 --> 38:48.576
Thanks.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.202
We’re real glad
to be working for you, sarge.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.502
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-Good night, sergeant.

38:59.628 --> 39:00.838
Good night, John.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.056
Hey. Feel like celebrating?

39:10.973 --> 39:12.933
-Not tonight.
-Yeah, we figured.

39:13.768 --> 39:16.395
-Sometime, we should celebrate, though.
-Sure.

39:17.271 --> 39:18.439
We’re proud of you.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.461
-We’re gonna take him now, down to court.
-Yeah, all right.

39:43.005 --> 39:45.216
Hey, any doubts
about you running the squad, Andy...

39:45.674 --> 39:47.176
Well, today, you put them all to rest.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.372
How’s it feel?

40:17.665 --> 40:20.751
-Takes some getting used to.
-Not from where I’m standing.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.254
Good work today.

40:25.506 --> 40:26.507
Good night.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.260
Boss.
