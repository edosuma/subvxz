[boy] <i>You gotta hook me up.</i>
<i>I need the answers for chemistry.</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:46.460
-Yeah, no, it's totally fine.
<i>-I just need to pass my class.</i>

00:47.673 --> 00:50.433
[sighs] Okay, so, uh, chemistry?

00:50.509 --> 00:52.219
[boy] <i>Yeah. The test is tomorrow.</i>

00:52.344 --> 00:55.184
-It's gonna be 30.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.425
Well, you know, last minute costs double.
I don't know.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.598
Do you wanna pass or not?
I'm the one that can give you an A.

Jet! Come on. No, we're done.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.937
-But I wasn't done with that.
-I don't care.

-Yeah, I'm still finishing my homework.

That's the rule.

You promised Mom
you'd pick her up this morning.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.837
You know what? Now I'm tutoring
Maverick Bowman in chemistry.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.460
And I have an English paper,

01:28.588 --> 01:31.588
and I have to finish
my scholarship application by Friday.

01:31.717 --> 01:34.847
I can't keep carting her around
just because she wrecked her car!

01:34.928 --> 01:36.138
It's out of the shop in a few days.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.721

-What did you say?

01:43.186 --> 01:47.816

you can be kind of a bitch.

Okay. It's okay.

-I'm gonna hit you with this.
-Whoa! Hey. Back up, back up.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.660
Let's put the TV down, all right?
Everything's gonna be fine.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.706

-Stop it!

03:33.088 --> 03:36.378
Freedom! Freedom!

03:38.927 --> 03:41.757
[Deidra] So I asked the public defender,
"Why is my mom's bail so high?"

03:41.888 --> 03:46.308
And he said that Good Buy is calling it
an act of domestic terrorism.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.855
But they don't think that really.
I mean, I think they just get

03:49.980 --> 03:52.400
a bigger insurance payment
if they call it terrorism.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.242
The public defender said
that you're not talking to him.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.370
But he's patient. And he has, like,
a lot of other cases to keep him busy.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.290
Would you shut up?
We need to get her serious.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.950
-We need to get her right, look at her.
-You know what's great

04:06.079 --> 04:09.579
about being in here? I mean, great.

04:09.708 --> 04:14.708
I get to choose
between kitchen or laundry.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.507
One or the other. Yeah.

04:16.630 --> 04:21.471
I mean... [laughs] I gotta tell you guys,
chopping carrots just...

04:21.595 --> 04:23.715
[mimics chopping]

04:25.849 --> 04:30.229
-It's therapeutic. It's, um... zen.
-That's... [clears throat]

04:30.353 --> 04:32.403
-That's great.
-Yes! Oh, get this.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.362
Did you guys know there's a law
in this state

04:34.483 --> 04:36.993
that says they have to serve salad
with every single meal in jail?

04:37.110 --> 04:41.320
Every meal has a salad. Yeah, salad law!

04:41.448 --> 04:43.988
-Do you have a playground?
-I do.

04:44.117 --> 04:48.037
And you know what? Mommy's doing yoga.
I'm surprisingly flexible.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.333
-I've always wanted to try--
-You know what? Enough, enough.

04:52.375 --> 04:55.085
I really hope that you are coming up
with a good excuse

04:55.212 --> 04:58.052
as to why you went all Rambo
on a Good Buy store.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.433
Baby, I gotta tell you something.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.391
That fact that you are taking
such good care of this family

05:04.513 --> 05:08.603
while I am away, it makes me feel so...

05:11.520 --> 05:13.020

I'm hoping for a more cogent
and scientific argument from you. Please.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.071
-Um...
-[taps pen on desk]

06:40.191 --> 06:43.861
Free will versus determinism.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.027
Free will,

06:45.113 --> 06:48.373
is that not the basic requirement
for human consciousness?

06:48.450 --> 06:51.540
I mean, the fact that humanity continues
to make scientific

06:51.661 --> 06:55.121
and artistic progress proves
that we are not simply repeating

06:55.248 --> 06:59.128

or environment.

"I wanna go to any college that's
at least a two-day drive

07:19.522 --> 07:21.692
from this goddamn hillbilly town."

07:22.400 --> 07:24.990
You wrote that,
on your college intent form.

07:25.111 --> 07:30.331
And you are the one and only senior
in your entire class

07:30.450 --> 07:32.790
who actually has the grades to do that.

07:33.787 --> 07:37.417
So why did you miss ten days
in the last three weeks?

07:37.540 --> 07:38.790
I wasn't keeping count.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.337
And what about your scholarship deadline?

07:42.337 --> 07:46.087
I had the recommendation letter ready
to go. I'm serious.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.256
Deidra, what do you wanna be?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.676
-What-- what do I wanna be?
-Yeah.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.096
You do realize that for thousands of years
of human history,

07:56.184 --> 07:59.194
the question, "What do you want to be"
didn't exist?

07:59.312 --> 08:02.572
No Mesopotamian farmer
asked his son, "What do you wanna be?"

08:02.691 --> 08:07.151
-I mean, you just be'd what you were.
-Well, you're "being" stupid.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.818
Thinking like that is quicksand
and you know it.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.618
Deidra Tanner does not feel stuck.
Deidra Tanner feels fierce.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.004
[chuckles] Okay--I, uh-- is that--

08:19.124 --> 08:22.504
Does everyone know that?
Okay, yes, that is true.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.707
That is true,
if I get one student into a college

08:25.839 --> 08:29.469
that does not have the word
"community" in the title,

08:29.592 --> 08:32.642
I could possibly get to teach
at a inner city school

08:32.761 --> 08:35.272
that's much... nicer than this one.

08:35.347 --> 08:40.097
But that does not mean I don't care
about the students here at this school.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.186
You deserve to get out.
We deserve to get out.

Do you know, in prison,
they serve a salad with every meal?

08:51.072 --> 08:52.572
Why don't we have that?

08:53.116 --> 08:54.986
Would you come to school for salad?

08:56.453 --> 08:58.873
I'll bring you a salad.
I'll get you any salad you want.

Could you repeat the question?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.910
I'll answer while she thinks.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.789
I would choose to meet Mary Tyler Moore.

09:40.914 --> 09:46.214
Because she used her television roles
to bring America smart, independent women.

09:47.170 --> 09:50.800
-And she is why I wanna be an actress.
-Wow, Claire, that was perfect.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.592
I would meet Taylor Swift.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.259
No way, that was my answer.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.308
-No way.
-No way.

I will announce the finalists.

Laney, what's wrong?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.298
I went from being nothing in school

10:30.421 --> 10:34.341
-to a nothing with a crazy mom.
-Hey, that's not true.

10:35.135 --> 10:39.755
Soon, people are gonna remember
how wonderful you are. I promise.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.979
Like, how you come
to these meetings with me

10:42.100 --> 10:45.270
-even though I know you hate it. [laughs]
-Yeah. I hate it.

my mom would go to jail.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.282
[woman] Okay, ladies.

10:59.784 --> 11:04.374
The time has come. We have four finalists.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.327
Ahem.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.456
Number one-- can I have a drum roll,
please? Just kidding, no drum roll.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.535

And for the rest of you
who did not make it,

11:46.122 --> 11:49.172
I still expect you to sell ten tickets
to the pageant.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.712
And then maybe,
you'll have better luck next year.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.054
For those of you who are seniors...

11:55.173 --> 11:57.513
I'm sorry. It's over for you.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.465
I didn't see you leave. [chuckles]

12:02.764 --> 12:05.684
Congrats on making finalist.
Of course, I knew you would.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.228
But... I mean,
we all know I'm the surprise.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.113
Um...

12:15.234 --> 12:16.574
This is cool, right?

12:17.320 --> 12:20.700
Laney, you were supposed to be there
and support me through all of this.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.333
-I just sat there.
-And now what,

12:22.450 --> 12:24.700
we're gonna compete
against each other? God!

12:25.578 --> 12:27.458
You're crazy.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.461
You're about as crazy as your weird mom,

12:30.583 --> 12:34.883
if you think this is ever
gonna be cool, okay?

12:40.760 --> 12:41.640
[sighs]

12:43.137 --> 12:45.217
Look, as long as there's food

12:45.348 --> 12:48.978
and you or another adult in the house,
we're gonna get along.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.936
-Great.
-But...

12:52.438 --> 12:57.438
if there is no food and no adult,
your siblings are gone.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.046
[sighs]

13:20.008 --> 13:23.758
Chief Manuelito, Treaty of 1868.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.057
Thank you.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.766
It's true, true, false.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.483
-Good.
-Thanks.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.396
It's "hk" not "kh."

13:38.151 --> 13:39.901
It's <i>nosotros somos.</i>

13:41.612 --> 13:42.742
Thank you.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.128
You don't wanna sell weed.
You broke up with me for selling.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.264
No, I broke up with you
because you have no ambition, but...

14:01.382 --> 14:03.182
I need a chunk of money, fast.

14:03.301 --> 14:07.011
-Yeah, well, I don't sell anymore.
-Come on, you support yourself here?

14:07.138 --> 14:10.098
-Hey, I do stuff.
-Really?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.483
I'm an entrepreneur.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.692
Oh, that's fancy.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.192
If you're hurting so bad,
why don't you apply for food stamps

14:17.315 --> 14:18.685
-like a normal person?
-Well, food stamps

14:18.816 --> 14:23.146
aren't gonna get me into college.
And I already tried to apply.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.069
Turns out my dad used to sell them outside
of the Piggly Wiggly

14:26.199 --> 14:28.659
when I was a kid.
Now the Tanners can't get them.

14:28.785 --> 14:29.865
Whoa.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.294
-What?
-You got a dad?

14:32.413 --> 14:33.373
[groans]

14:33.498 --> 14:34.958
Why are you begging me?
Hit up the old man.

14:35.083 --> 14:39.753
I'm-- I'm not gonna-- no.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.842
Killer boots, Kid Blammo.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.973
I should get me some boots like that.

14:47.095 --> 14:50.845
They would look good on me.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.193
Oop, oop. Watch them nuts. [chuckles]

14:57.355 --> 14:59.685
-Sweet pea?
-Hi.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.936
-What are you--
-Dad.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.445
Uh, hey, come inside.

15:07.281 --> 15:09.161
[groans]

15:09.283 --> 15:11.373
-Do you want some--
-No.

15:12.495 --> 15:16.245
Oh! And, uh, hold on.
I got something for you.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.343
Maybe a five in there.
Maybe even be a couple.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.299
So I mean, no child support
since Jet was born,

15:26.426 --> 15:30.386
and... you only saved $13.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.273
Yeah, but it's cash.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.720
It's not about the mo--

15:33.850 --> 15:37.060
Look, I'm the best dad
when it comes to moral support.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.056
-What?
-I am always there when you need me,

15:39.188 --> 15:42.398
-gone when you don't.
-Yeah, well, we can't eat moral support.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.985
-Do you still have that truck?
-Oh, yeah.

15:45.111 --> 15:48.241
-Yeah? Could you sell it?
-What? Sell my truck?

15:48.364 --> 15:51.914
-Why?
-Well... [sighs] No.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.334
-It won't be enough money anyway.
-How would I get to work?

15:54.454 --> 15:57.084
-This was a dumb idea. I'm gonna go.
-How would I get--

15:57.206 --> 15:59.996
Wait, wait! No, sweet pea, don't go!

16:00.126 --> 16:02.206
I don't ever get to see you.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.798
Come here! What--
Do you wanna see your old man on TV?

16:06.924 --> 16:08.724
-No, I don't.
-Yeah, no, come look at this.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.643
I was on TV. They made a video file
that fits on my phone.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.222
-No.
-No, you gotta see this. Real quick.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.808
So I was filling a slot in Salt Lake,

16:16.934 --> 16:19.194
and they came to do an interview.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.732
Wasn't me, but it was of this...

16:20.855 --> 16:23.105
<i>We're here at the Pacific</i>
<i>Western Rail train yard</i>

16:23.232 --> 16:25.032
<i>where more than $3 million</i>
<i>of merchandise has...</i>

16:25.151 --> 16:27.571
-There I am. [laughing]
<i>-disappeared over the last couple months.</i>

16:27.695 --> 16:30.235
Look who's part of the newscast.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.534
Your old man. There he is.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.828
<i>Thank you for doing this.</i>
<i>Mr. Truman, let's start with--</i>

16:34.952 --> 16:36.832
<i>-Detective Truman.</i>
<i>-Detective Truman. Excuse me.</i>

16:36.954 --> 16:39.754
<i>-Let's talk about what...</i>
-Oh, there he goes. [laughs]

16:39.874 --> 16:43.134
-Wait, so people still rob trains?
-Oh, yeah.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.342
They do it all the time. It's easy.
But not that I've personally--

16:46.464 --> 16:48.424
See, the companies,
they pay for insurance,

16:48.549 --> 16:49.879
then the insurance
just reimburses the companies.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.389
And then we as the consumers,

16:51.511 --> 16:53.891
we pay, like, a 10% markup
on everything anyway.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.263
It covers the theft, so...

16:55.389 --> 16:57.639
<i>So no new information</i>
<i>about what was stolen?</i>

16:57.767 --> 16:59.637
[Deidra] Well, rail police?

16:59.769 --> 17:03.309
Like... police, police?

17:03.439 --> 17:04.769
That's what they call themselves.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.989
They're just there to cover the company's
ass. It's corporate bullshit.

17:08.109 --> 17:10.359
Yeah, and the whole yard got sacked
in New Orleans.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.568
So Abe's gonna transfer down there
to fill a slot,

17:12.698 --> 17:16.907
which opens up a slot for head mechanic.
Guess who's gonna slide in there.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.915
-Thanks.
-I've gotta go.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.290
What? Wait, why?
I'm gonna be head mechanic, babe!

18:03.040 --> 18:04.000
A pageant?

18:04.125 --> 18:06.455
I only joined because Claire told me
to come with her.

18:06.586 --> 18:12.586
-I'm sorry, Claire?
-She's-- she's my only friend after...

18:13.551 --> 18:15.221
You have friends?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.310
[sighs]

18:17.430 --> 18:22.180
-Nothing good ever happens to me.
-Hey, no. Laney bug.

18:22.310 --> 18:26.610
-You won that Geography Bee, remember?
-That was Deidra.

18:27.523 --> 18:31.113
Yes, it was Deidra, wasn't it?
Um...

18:31.235 --> 18:34.855
Hey, did I ever tell you
that I was Teen Miss Idaho?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.739
Oh, yeah.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.776
Right when I was your age.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.699
I had a crown and a sash
and a dress and the whole thing.

18:41.829 --> 18:45.459
I felt so special.
I even got to audition for <i>Teen Life.</i>

18:45.583 --> 18:49.173
-Oh. What's that?
-<i>Teen Life,</i> the TV show.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.337
It was the reality show of the '90s.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.465
Every teenager in the world wanted
to be on it

18:55.593 --> 18:58.643
and the producers, they loved me.
They said that I was spunky.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.523
What? You didn't do it?

19:02.767 --> 19:05.767
No, no, couldn't do it.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.895
I got pregnant with your sister.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.822
Thought I could reach
for something more, but...

19:12.777 --> 19:16.947
-"More" is not for us.
-No, baby, I don't think it is.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.707
[sobs and sniffles]
Okay, uh, we should go.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.580
-Come on. We gotta go.
-Huh?

19:26.707 --> 19:29.287
-Laney bug?
-Bye, Mama.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.346
-[grunting]
-[metal snaps]

20:25.224 --> 20:27.524
Shit, shit, shit.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.824
[kernels popping]

20:43.534 --> 20:44.584
[beeps]

20:48.831 --> 20:50.831
Sorry, buddy, it's not much.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.668
We're out of food, and the power's out.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.513
-I'll add it to my list.
-Where were you?

21:45.137 --> 21:48.137
I, uh, went to see Chet.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.728
I went to see Mom.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.982
[sighs] Remember, um...

21:56.690 --> 21:59.110
Remember when Chet used
to let us ride the trains?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.775
[chuckles] Yeah. Stupid.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.620
[sighs]

22:07.993 --> 22:10.663
I got finalist
for the Teen Miss Idaho pageant.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.504
I'm gonna rob the train.

22:19.755 --> 22:23.375
-Well, why did I think you'd care?
-I'm not joking.

22:23.509 --> 22:27.469
I mean, forget school, glitter bunny.
Do you know what's going on here?

22:27.596 --> 22:30.676
Yeah. Mom's in jail,
and you're talking about train robbing.

22:30.808 --> 22:34.138
No, I'm about to give up going to college
so that I can get a full-time job

22:34.270 --> 22:37.770
to support you and Jet.
And even then, I might not make enough.

22:37.898 --> 22:41.358
What about savings?
Mom said everything would work out.

22:41.485 --> 22:45.065
Look how we live.
Does it seem like things work out for Mom?

22:46.031 --> 22:47.371
What if we lose the house?

22:47.491 --> 22:50.541
What if CPS lady comes back
and the power's still out?

22:50.661 --> 22:53.501
You and Jet would go to foster care.

22:54.665 --> 22:57.455
We would only need a little over 11,000.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.745
I mean, that would cover the bills,
Mom's bail.

22:59.878 --> 23:03.088
She could go back to work,
and our lives would go back to normal.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.675
You said it. We used to ride the trains
when we were kids.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.181
No way. Wait, what?

23:08.304 --> 23:10.724
-I tried it myself and it didn't--
-You what?

23:10.848 --> 23:12.678
-Look, I didn't get caught.
-Dee!

23:12.808 --> 23:15.138
I didn't get caught. I just...

23:15.269 --> 23:17.979
I need somebody to spot me. That's it.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.355
I promise I won't let anything happen
to you.

23:20.482 --> 23:23.112
No, you can't find someone else?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.485
Who else is gonna help me rob trains?

23:27.281 --> 23:28.281
Dee...

23:33.078 --> 23:36.078
[train horn blaring]

23:38.250 --> 23:39.250
Fine.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.763
But it's not gonna work. So...

23:44.923 --> 23:46.593
Yes, it is, glitter bunny.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.257
[horn blaring]

23:57.311 --> 24:00.481
[Deidra]
<i>So how does one rob a train?</i>

24:01.398 --> 24:03.568
<i>Well, there are dozens of different cars.</i>

24:03.692 --> 24:07.822
<i>Like grain cars, oil cars...</i>

24:07.946 --> 24:09.066
<i>box cars.</i>

24:09.198 --> 24:12.578
<i>The goods we want travel</i>
<i>in containers on flat cars.</i>

24:15.913 --> 24:19.253
<i>But the container doors</i>
<i>are locked with steel bolts.</i>

24:19.375 --> 24:22.165
<i>We'll need something strong enough</i>
<i>to cut through them.</i>

24:26.048 --> 24:28.048
[line ringing]

24:30.427 --> 24:33.217
<i>The shippers might figure out</i>
<i>a container's been opened.</i>

24:33.347 --> 24:37.347
<i>But with 138,000 miles of track in the US,</i>

24:37.476 --> 24:40.096
<i>they'll never know</i>
<i>where the break-in happened.</i>

24:40.229 --> 24:42.519
If you get caught, don't snitch.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.938
Over here we have the train schedule,
so we know exactly when they're coming.

24:46.068 --> 24:51.318
8,000 and 10,000. And then bingo.

24:51.448 --> 24:52.568
Give me some skin.

<i>five to pick boxes</i>

It's funny, right?

Sure about--
Oh, you mean the robbery

26:03.145 --> 26:05.475
that we've been planning all week?
Yeah, I'm sure about it.

26:05.606 --> 26:09.026
Okay, but wait. Planning it is one thing,
but actually doing it?

26:09.151 --> 26:12.071
Laney, we are going to rob a train, okay?

26:12.196 --> 26:15.446
Do you wanna bail Mom out?
Because this is how we're gonna do it.

He knows he's not supposed
to play over here.

-[shushing]
-Laney!

28:12.024 --> 28:14.654
-Go, go, go! We gotta split up!
-What?

28:48.727 --> 28:51.057
[train horn blaring]

29:01.823 --> 29:04.663
[crossing bells clanging]

29:14.503 --> 29:16.593
[train horn blaring, faint]

29:52.833 --> 29:53.883
Dee!

29:55.168 --> 29:56.168
Dee.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.086
[sighs] Are you okay?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.135
Okay, come on.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.316
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.617
-[Deidra] Shut up.
-[Laney] Wait.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.202
-Okay. I got it, I got it.
-Okay.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.698
Oh, Lord have mercy.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.789
-Okay.
-All right.

30:32.873 --> 30:33.753
[grunting]

30:33.832 --> 30:36.502
-Hurry. One, two, three.
-Okay.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.585
[laughing]

30:39.546 --> 30:41.506
-Oh, shit! Get down!
-Oh, shit.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.716
Remember when you
pushed me off the train?

30:45.969 --> 30:49.929
Remember when I made you carry
freight boxes back to the house?

30:50.557 --> 30:53.977
Towels, three microwaves and...

30:57.230 --> 30:58.650
Jeans.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.824
This is Deidra.

31:00.942 --> 31:04.152
Straight A queen.
This is G Dog and Wally.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.120
Check it out.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.504
Where'd you get all this?

31:13.622 --> 31:16.122
Do you want this stuff or not,
Mr. Entrepreneur?

31:16.249 --> 31:18.629
Socks?
What the hell are we gonna do with socks?

31:18.752 --> 31:22.012
-There's other stuff, too.
-Laundry detergent!

31:23.590 --> 31:25.260
What? That shit's expensive.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.734
All right.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.317
[bell dings]

31:42.442 --> 31:44.532
[receipt printer buzzing]

31:50.492 --> 31:52.832
I am not letting you drop out.
No slouching.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.293
Why? I mean, you've seen me during Q&A.

31:56.415 --> 32:00.835
People are staring at me. I get all hot.
My brain turns to cat food.

32:00.961 --> 32:01.961
Cat food?

32:03.130 --> 32:06.880
Sweetie, you were never supposed
to make finalist.

32:06.967 --> 32:09.257
But a girl in Lakewood dropped out
because she was pregnant,

32:09.386 --> 32:12.386
and the judges said I could choose
whoever I wanted, and so here you are.

32:12.514 --> 32:15.144
Why me? There are tons
of other not-pregnant girls.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.767
I could see you needed it the most.

32:18.770 --> 32:23.610
Believe it or not, I was once like you.
Shy, constantly embarrassed.

32:23.733 --> 32:27.703
And then I realized, I wasn't shy at all.
I was just out of place.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.951
I was a Princess Kate living
in a Kardashian world.

32:31.074 --> 32:35.954
-I'm... just a Tanner.
-We'll see about that.

32:36.079 --> 32:37.619
Unh-unh. Handle.

32:38.373 --> 32:41.843
Four fingers down, pinkie up. Like a lady.

32:42.919 --> 32:46.759
-Hey! [laughing]
-You said you would call. What happened?

32:46.882 --> 32:48.132
Look.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.337
Yeah, well...

32:50.469 --> 32:53.259
-So tonight?
-Again?

32:54.139 --> 32:56.349
Do you have something better to do?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.847
-No.
-No. Oh, my God.

34:06.044 --> 34:10.474
-Uh... maybe. Yeah.
-So, uh...

34:13.510 --> 34:18.179
So there's this pageant dress rehearsal
next week at school

34:18.306 --> 34:20.226
and they're inviting parents,
and I was wondering

34:20.350 --> 34:24.350
if maybe you wanna come.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.768
Hell no. That sounds terrible.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.487
Yeah, it will be.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.239
You know, why do you care
about this pageant stuff?

34:33.362 --> 34:35.373
I mean, we have bigger things
to deal with.

34:35.489 --> 34:38.870
Well, I tried to drop out
because Claire's super pissed,

34:38.994 --> 34:42.254
-but Ms. Fowler won't let me.
-Claire? Who is that?

34:42.371 --> 34:44.752
Claire, my best friend, you know.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.420
-I have friends.
-Man, get back at her by winning.

34:48.545 --> 34:51.585
-Funny.
-Why's that funny?

34:52.716 --> 34:55.085
You say "winning" like it's not hard.

34:55.217 --> 34:58.888
Is it, though?
We're talking about a human dog show.

34:59.014 --> 35:02.644
Well, Mom was Teen Miss Idaho.
She was gonna be a reality TV star,

35:02.767 --> 35:05.347
but then she had us,
and her life went to crap.

35:06.062 --> 35:09.322
Wait a minute. Whoa, wait. What?

35:09.441 --> 35:12.361
[sighs] Her point being
that I am nobody

35:12.485 --> 35:15.775
because I am meant to be nobody,
and there's no use in trying.

35:15.905 --> 35:19.195
So she gets herself nowhere,
and now she blames us?

35:21.661 --> 35:25.081
You know what? You are not nobody.

35:25.206 --> 35:29.246
You are a badass who robs trains.

35:30.337 --> 35:32.837
You're my Sundance Kid.

35:34.341 --> 35:35.841
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.797
Bring it in. Mmm! Just like that.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.806
-Now come over here and help me.
-Okay.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.666
[woman] <i>And no screw-ups like last time.</i>

36:11.795 --> 36:13.625
I thought he was my suspect.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.545
Night watchmen should wear
brightly-colored uniforms.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.215
<i>Well, you're teaming with local PD.</i>

36:18.343 --> 36:21.513
Oh, well, that's very helpful.
Thank you very much.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.771
[Chet] Hey!

36:25.975 --> 36:26.975
I know you.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.397
We were on TV together.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.438
What you up to, buddy?

36:33.525 --> 36:37.315
I'm trying to think of a small word
that means "ignoramus."

36:41.366 --> 36:43.906
Well... all right then.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.101
You told her not to even try.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.313
Have you met your daughter?
She can barely order pizza over the phone.

37:08.435 --> 37:10.725
-Deidra, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.768
What if this is something that she needed?

37:13.898 --> 37:17.148
-You said that we ruined your life.
-What?

37:17.277 --> 37:19.447
No. Deidra, that is not what I meant.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.201
You know what?
I am gonna take care of Laney now.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.704
[Goldie] That's not what I meant.

37:32.834 --> 37:33.884
[man] Right there.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.422
The height, the build, the energy,
these are obviously teenagers,

37:36.546 --> 37:38.296
and they're probably mine.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.803
Or maybe they could be very short adults.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.046
-Ever think of that, Mr. Truman?
-Detective Truman.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.509
And I know the difference
between teenagers and midgets.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.809
Don't say that word.
Nobody says that word anymore.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.983
I understand the students
in this school ascend

37:51.102 --> 37:54.942
-to a particular level of miscreancy.
-They're not my students.

37:55.064 --> 37:57.194
I mean,
I'm transferring to a better school

37:57.317 --> 37:59.067
as soon as I get all
the college applications.

37:59.194 --> 38:03.204
Trust me, I'm as embarrassed to be
in this godforsaken burg as you are.

38:03.323 --> 38:06.623
I am Pacific Western Railroad's
top investigator.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.293
I never partner with local PD.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.081
I never babysit rent-a-cops.
New experience for both of us, I guess.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.166
I typically take down
organized criminal syndicates.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.212
I do not want
to be investigating teenagers.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.722
Now, I know that you're gonna feel
the need to protect your students,

38:21.841 --> 38:24.181
but any information you have

38:24.302 --> 38:27.972
that could make this investigation
go faster would be appreciated by me,

38:28.097 --> 38:30.887
my railroad
and the United States government.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.022
[sighs]

39:21.526 --> 39:23.566
Excuse me, ladies,
have you seen Deidra Tanner?

39:23.695 --> 39:26.815
Okay. Has anyone seen Deidra Tanner?

39:26.948 --> 39:29.328
Okay. Mr. Morrissey, hi.
Have you seen Deidra Tanner?

39:29.450 --> 39:31.700
Hmm... I don't think she's been
in class all week.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.711
I need the light!

39:38.042 --> 39:40.212
-I need--
-[Laney] Where's Mr. Bear?

39:41.045 --> 39:42.295
Thank you.

39:46.801 --> 39:50.011
-Dee, there's cameras!
-What? No! Laney!

39:50.096 --> 39:52.926
Oh, God! Please!

39:54.183 --> 39:55.523
I'm gonna kill you.

39:56.185 --> 39:58.265
Those cameras weren't there yesterday.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.856
So what?
It's not like anybody watches them.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.862
[knock on door]

40:06.279 --> 40:08.109
-Who's that?
-I don't know. Just answer the door.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.239
Answer the door.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.615
-I don't want to.
-Just get it.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.792
-We'll be fine.
-What are you gonna do with that?

40:12.911 --> 40:14.581
If you don't answer the door,
I swear to God.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.714
-All right.
-Just... be cool.

40:17.790 --> 40:20.170
-Hey, there.
-Hey, there.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.553
-I'm looking for Deidra.
-[whispers] I'm not here.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.295
She's not here right now.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.144
-She's not here?
-Nope.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.760
She's right here.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.057
-Like right here?
-Laney!

40:32.180 --> 40:34.430
Deidra, get your things.
We're going to school.

40:42.357 --> 40:45.897
-Now's not a good time.
-I cannot believe you did this.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.947
I can't believe that one day
random cells started to divide

40:49.072 --> 40:51.622
and form complex organisms,
but it happened.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.531
Is it you and your sister?
Is this a trend?

40:53.660 --> 40:55.540
-Are there more people? Who is it?
-Nobody.

40:55.662 --> 40:57.872
-I'll guarantee that.
-I'm gonna have to tell Principal Wagner.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.077
-No, no.
-We're on a zero tolerance policy.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.208
-No, you don't have to tell.
-I do have to tell.

41:03.336 --> 41:06.836
There was a Pacific Western rail cop
in my office two days ago

41:06.965 --> 41:10.965
-looking for teenage train robbers.
-I was just doing what you said.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.854
-What did I say?
-You told me to get desperate

41:12.971 --> 41:14.931
so I can bail my mom out
and come back to school.

41:15.056 --> 41:18.386
-That is not what I meant.
-Well, now college is back on the table.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.648
I mean, rolling deadlines are still open,

41:20.770 --> 41:23.770
and I'm actually saving money
for my first semester.

41:24.524 --> 41:27.994
-I can apply to any college you want.
-Even the Ivies?

41:29.654 --> 41:33.494
Why am I even considering this? No.
You are a thief and an extortionist.

41:33.616 --> 41:36.236
You know, if I go to jail,
your valedictorian

41:36.369 --> 41:38.499
-is gonna be Stacy Alberts.
-Oh, God.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.081
The girl who wants to major
in domestic engineering.

41:41.207 --> 41:44.087
She'll bring up cast iron cookware
in her speech.

41:49.048 --> 41:51.428
Deal. [groans]
Now, I'm an accomplice.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.341
-Okay.
-Oh, sorry.

41:53.469 --> 41:56.009
Tell me about this train cop.

41:56.139 --> 42:00.139
And finally we can never invest too much
in Pre-K education.

42:00.268 --> 42:05.148
Way to go, Claire. Excellent answer.
Laney, you're next.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.776
Oh, wow, that's a really nice dress.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.951
Did your mom make that
in a prison sweatshop?

42:11.070 --> 42:16.030
Laney, name your favorite school holiday
and why.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.793
My favorite school holiday is...

42:21.456 --> 42:24.956
Columbus Day. Because we
wouldn't be here without Columbus.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.877
Unless you're Indian,
Native American, then...

42:29.839 --> 42:32.679
Martin Luther King Day. Duh.

42:34.719 --> 42:38.009
Okay. Well, most of your answers
blew me away.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.477
Ladies,
that signifies the end of rehearsal.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.404
-[grunts]
-[all gasping]

42:46.272 --> 42:48.902
[laughing]

42:52.904 --> 42:55.574
-[stammers] I already told my kid.
-With the cop poking around,

42:55.698 --> 42:59.658
-I can't promote someone with a record.
-I'm not the one stealing this time.

42:59.786 --> 43:02.206
[telephone ringing]

43:02.330 --> 43:03.540
Yeah, go.

43:04.874 --> 43:08.134
Yeah.
He dropped a traction motor on his toe?

43:08.252 --> 43:10.002
That's what happens
when you promote the wrong people.

43:10.129 --> 43:13.509
I'm coming right down. Just a sec.
Next time it comes around.

43:13.633 --> 43:15.803
There may not be a next time!

43:18.513 --> 43:21.973
Mr. Bear? What are you doing here?

43:23.101 --> 43:28.151
Good afternoon.
My name is Victor Truman,

43:28.272 --> 43:34.282
and I have been deployed here
by the Pacific Western Railroad Company...

43:34.904 --> 43:36.704
to enlighten all of you

43:36.823 --> 43:41.413
as to the lethal dangers of rail traffic.

43:49.669 --> 43:50.669
Ha ha!

43:50.753 --> 43:52.463
-[laughs]
-Dee, stop it.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.047
What the hell is this?

43:54.132 --> 43:57.512
I don't know. Some guy came into school
today and gave us a speech.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.885
-Oh, my God, this is disgusting.
-[sighs]

44:01.013 --> 44:03.273
What do you think it means?
Do you think they know?

44:03.975 --> 44:08.645
No. No, of course not.
I mean, they have that every year.

44:08.771 --> 44:10.611
I had to sit through it last year.

44:10.731 --> 44:14.321
The health teacher has a stack of those
on his desk next to the bowl of condoms.

44:14.443 --> 44:16.283
I've never heard of...

44:16.404 --> 44:18.874
Well, you don't pay very much attention
in school.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.992
Maybe it's something to think about.

44:22.118 --> 44:25.498
-What is?
-Packing up shop, bringing Mom home.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.961
I feel like we're not getting
enough money out of this.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.712
No, we're not.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.090
Oh, shit!

44:34.213 --> 44:37.133
It's CPS day.
Laney, you were supposed to be home!

44:37.258 --> 44:39.178
You were supposed to be home!

44:46.350 --> 44:47.850
[Laney] Oh, my God!

44:49.729 --> 44:52.569
Hey, don't be so dramatic, honey.

44:52.690 --> 44:56.440
You know, every time Uncle Dennis
comes in and does a little housework,

44:56.569 --> 44:59.239
-they act like they've seen Bigfoot.
-[chuckling]

45:00.197 --> 45:04.157
-[woman] You are just a hoot.
-No sasquatch here.

45:05.077 --> 45:07.577
-More pancakes?
-[woman] You know, I probably will.

45:07.705 --> 45:11.165
You are gonna make
an excellent husband someday.

45:12.668 --> 45:13.788
Thank you.

45:14.921 --> 45:17.511
Well, Gloria, kinda hate to see you go.

45:17.632 --> 45:20.132
-Oh, well, thank you.
-Yeah.

45:20.259 --> 45:24.389
With all of these kids running around,
it's nice to have an adult conversation.

45:24.513 --> 45:27.853
-Ooh, I'm an adult. [laughing]
-Just barely.

45:27.975 --> 45:29.805
Barely legal.

45:30.728 --> 45:35.608
-So are you gonna be here next week?
-Well, I'm hoping so. Will you?

45:36.859 --> 45:38.649
-It's a date.
-Okay.

45:38.778 --> 45:41.568
Well, you know, a court-ordered meeting.

45:41.697 --> 45:46.237
Or a date.
You got a little syrup right there.

45:46.369 --> 45:48.579
-Got it.
-Thanks.

45:48.704 --> 45:51.214
-Okay. Bye now.
-Bye.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.629
[car engine starts]

45:56.963 --> 45:58.713
Chet, what are you doing here?

46:00.800 --> 46:03.640
Chet? Chet, what are you doing here?

46:03.761 --> 46:05.181
-Chet, no! Don't!
-Wait!

46:05.304 --> 46:07.604
[Chet] Well, lookee what we have here.

46:07.723 --> 46:09.433
I'll give you one point for organization.

46:09.558 --> 46:11.558
That little thermometer chart,
that's a nice touch.

46:11.686 --> 46:14.556
But minus three points
for your dumb shittery.

46:14.689 --> 46:19.609
What are you thinking? Huh?
These can't be here.

46:19.735 --> 46:22.025
Any Joe Piss can wander down the street
and look back here,

46:22.154 --> 46:24.034
and you're looking at county lockup,
three years minimum.

46:24.156 --> 46:25.736
Chet, you can't be here legally.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.486
Burn these. That's the best way
to destroy the evidence,

46:28.619 --> 46:29.869
but do not tell your mother.

46:29.996 --> 46:32.366
What if that CPS lady figures out
who you really are?

46:32.498 --> 46:35.168
-I mean, what if she sees your record?
-Manifest Destiny.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.132
A man has a right to protect his family
regardless of the law.

46:38.254 --> 46:40.264
-That is not Manifest Destiny.
-You know something?

46:40.381 --> 46:43.301
Your Uncle Dennis
did a little recognizance.

46:43.426 --> 46:47.176
It turns out old Gloria, she has
over 200 cases in this county alone.

46:47.304 --> 46:49.064
So she ain't gonna be looking me up.

46:50.099 --> 46:52.019
Honey, come give me a hand with this one.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.733
No. No, don't do that.
I can handle this myself.

46:55.855 --> 46:58.225
Oh, can you? Okay.

46:58.357 --> 47:00.607
How's that cop
gonna run his investigation?

47:00.735 --> 47:03.485
-A cop?
-You don't know.

47:03.612 --> 47:06.202
-Oh, my God.
-You don't know.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.623
But I do because I've been investigated
many times.

47:09.577 --> 47:12.997
-Not cool.
-You girls know how you got caught?

47:13.122 --> 47:14.872
-The dude from school?
-Nope.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.289
On the bottom of each shipping container,
there's a sticker.

47:17.418 --> 47:19.458
And on the sticker, there's a bar code.

47:19.587 --> 47:22.127
And that bar code
matches the shipping manifest.

47:22.256 --> 47:25.376
So when you open the container,
it rips the sticker, destroys the bar code

47:25.509 --> 47:27.139
so it can't be scanned
at the next checkpoint.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.851
-An investigation?
-Oh, yeah.

47:31.057 --> 47:32.597
The cameras.

47:33.225 --> 47:37.515
-[mutters]
-Oh, and, uh... recognize him?

47:38.522 --> 47:39.362
Mr. Bear?

47:40.483 --> 47:43.113
I gave you Mr. Bear
at your eighth birthday party,

47:43.235 --> 47:45.855
right before your mom kicked me out
when my dealer ate the cake.

47:45.988 --> 47:47.618
-Could you just stay? Come.
-Laney.

47:47.698 --> 47:48.528
[Laney] No.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.293
I ain't got nowhere to go.

47:51.410 --> 47:52.910
A cop?

47:55.998 --> 47:58.828
Spencer told me on Monday,
but it's not a big deal.

47:58.959 --> 47:59.919
Not a big deal?

48:00.044 --> 48:04.844
-Our felon father is in the backyard.
-I will try to get rid of Chet.

48:04.965 --> 48:05.965
-No. No.
-Okay?

48:06.092 --> 48:09.972
-He knows. We have to stop.
-No, look, this is Chet, okay?

48:10.096 --> 48:12.846
He will probably get bored
and go home tomorrow.

48:12.973 --> 48:14.143
[slurping]

48:14.266 --> 48:18.186
-[Wally] We told you not to bring anyone.
-He promised he would be quiet.

48:19.355 --> 48:20.765
We're still trying to move the backpacks.

48:20.898 --> 48:21.898
-Backpacks?
-What?

48:22.024 --> 48:24.074
What? No. What is this, Walmart?

48:24.193 --> 48:26.033
-Chet, shut up.
-What's our cut?

48:26.904 --> 48:28.784
-Forty percent.
-Forty percent, no.

48:28.906 --> 48:30.866
-That's highway robbery.
-That's exactly what this is.

48:30.991 --> 48:34.291
We need to make money too, all right?
I'm saving up for the culinary institute.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.581
I like your style, but listen to this.

48:36.705 --> 48:39.875
What if I can guarantee you
electronics, cosmetics...

48:40.000 --> 48:41.630
I'm talking name brands.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.802
-You can't do that.
-I can do that.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.341
-No.
-Yep, I can.

48:45.464 --> 48:47.634
-You give my girl 60% here.
-Sixty?

48:47.758 --> 48:51.098
Sixty percent and you'll be graduating
from the French toast to the brioche.

48:51.220 --> 48:53.180
-We can't do that.
-We can do that.

48:53.305 --> 48:54.515
-[Jerry] Can you?
-No.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.640
We can. Do we have a deal?

49:06.443 --> 49:08.823
-Sixty percent.
-Sixty percent.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.196
-Name brands.
-Name brands.

49:10.322 --> 49:14.542
-Electronics.
-Electronics.

49:14.660 --> 49:17.200
-You got a deal. Whoo!
-All right.

49:17.329 --> 49:18.539
Hey!

49:20.916 --> 49:23.456
-I did not need you to speak for me.
-Why?

49:23.586 --> 49:25.746
I'll just log some hours
at the switching station.

49:25.880 --> 49:27.380
That way, we know exactly
what's coming in.

49:27.506 --> 49:30.046
Everything that we have right now,
I got myself.

49:30.176 --> 49:33.136
-Without you or Mom.
-Of course you did.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.391
But that's because of me, too.

49:35.514 --> 49:38.064
Look, honey. We're the same chunks of DNA.

49:38.184 --> 49:40.734
We run around
influencing each other's actions.

49:40.853 --> 49:44.523
-Now I was a mess when you were little.
-Yeah.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.898
That helped you to learn for yourself.

49:47.526 --> 49:52.236
Are you seriously trying to take credit
for all of my hard work and success?

49:52.364 --> 49:55.414
No. I'm just saying that...

49:55.534 --> 49:59.794
you finally need my help
for something that I'm good at.

50:07.963 --> 50:11.223
-I was thinking...
-Yeah?

50:12.760 --> 50:15.760
-About the stickers.
-Stickers, yeah.

50:17.556 --> 50:20.306
If you swipe the shipping manifest,

50:20.434 --> 50:23.064
I could print new stickers
in the computer lab.

50:23.187 --> 50:27.267
Yes! Yeah, see,
that is that Tanner ingenuity.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.608
-Let's go!
-I don't have the keys.

50:31.612 --> 50:32.992
Got 'em.

50:42.957 --> 50:44.327
[Deidra] Look for the X.

50:44.458 --> 50:46.498
Look for the-- oh, there it is!

50:46.627 --> 50:48.297
Go! Go, go, go.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.484
-[chuckling] Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

51:31.672 --> 51:33.342
None of the seals were broken.

51:33.465 --> 51:36.635
[woman] <i>Then why am I missing</i>
<i>three TVs and a case of cell phones?</i>

51:36.760 --> 51:38.930
<i>You said you would have this</i>
<i>done in a week.</i>

51:39.054 --> 51:42.814
Yes, I know I did, but I cannot figure
this out snooping around a school

51:42.933 --> 51:48.063
with a pacifist cop and a counselor
who clearly needs to be on medication.

51:48.188 --> 51:50.978
-Please give me back my gun.
<i>-Are you serious?</i>

51:51.108 --> 51:52.688
<i>After what happened in Arizona?</i>

51:52.818 --> 51:54.488
<i>You are lucky I let you</i>
<i>carry a flashlight.</i>

51:54.612 --> 51:56.322
Yes, I know. I got the memo.

51:57.865 --> 51:59.025
Goldie...

52:00.200 --> 52:02.750
You look ten years younger
and 20 years finer.

52:02.870 --> 52:05.540
If the table wasn't here,
I'd put another baby in you.

52:05.664 --> 52:07.334
What are you doing living with my kids?

52:07.458 --> 52:10.208
Our kids.
'Cause I'm the best dad in the world.

52:10.336 --> 52:11.666
I'm there when you need me,
I'm gone when you don't.

52:11.795 --> 52:14.375
-We don't. They don't.
-Listen.

52:16.508 --> 52:18.888
There's a big debt. It's still there.

52:19.011 --> 52:21.681
And only you can fix that debt.

52:21.805 --> 52:25.135
Only you can heal that debt,
from the heart.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.597
So...

52:27.728 --> 52:30.108
-Why am I so attracted to you?
-[mutters]

52:30.230 --> 52:32.780
-And I wonder why--
-Can I just...

52:36.362 --> 52:40.072
-Your nails look nice.
-Thank you. They do 'em in here.

52:40.199 --> 52:41.739
-Can I just...
-They did a good job.

52:41.867 --> 52:43.737
-Chet.
-Yeah?

52:43.869 --> 52:46.289
-I hate you so much.
-I hate you too.

52:46.413 --> 52:48.963
-I hate you so much.
-I hate you more.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.673
I hate you so much, Chet.

52:50.793 --> 52:53.383
-[man] Guard! Guard!
-Hey! Hey!

52:53.504 --> 52:55.014
Okay, that's it!

52:55.130 --> 52:57.380
-Break it up! Break it up!
-Get the spot, baby.

52:57.508 --> 52:58.878
-Phyllis! Phyllis!
-Yeah, I got it.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.639
-Oh, my God. Chet.
-You both get off!

53:00.761 --> 53:01.971
-[alarm blaring]
-Okay, okay.

53:02.096 --> 53:03.676
-Okay, okay.
-Okay, okay!

53:03.806 --> 53:06.266
Come on, baby! Come on! Okay!

53:06.392 --> 53:08.272
-No! She's coming with me!
-Just one more, just one more.

53:08.394 --> 53:10.104
-She's coming with me!
-We're going in the hall.

53:10.229 --> 53:13.819
[Truman] Overnight, this operation
has gone from erratic

53:13.941 --> 53:16.241
to the most sophisticated I've seen
in my career.

53:16.360 --> 53:20.280
So our investigation has to evolve.
I'm gonna start interviewing students.

53:20.406 --> 53:25.366
Anyone who lives within
a five-mile perimeter of that train yard

53:25.494 --> 53:27.834
gets interviewed by me.

53:45.180 --> 53:46.930
We are so screwed.

53:49.726 --> 53:51.016
We're gonna be so rich.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.904
I'm confused.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.360
The Federal Mint.

53:57.693 --> 53:59.613
The Federal Mint has a car?

53:59.736 --> 54:01.066
-Like, to ship money?
-Yeah.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.696
But it's rare, and guys like me
never know which train it's in.

54:03.824 --> 54:07.744
-This is a great opportunity.
-That's the night of my pageant.

54:07.870 --> 54:10.910
-Laney! Do you care about this at all?
-Yeah.

54:11.039 --> 54:14.289
I mean, train dude is bringing us in
for questioning tomorrow.

54:14.418 --> 54:15.918
-I know.
-Are you ready for that?

54:16.044 --> 54:18.264
Yeah, what are you gonna say
when train dude starts questioning you?

54:18.839 --> 54:20.089
-Um--
-What are you gonna do, Laney?

54:20.215 --> 54:21.425
Um...

54:21.550 --> 54:24.550
No. Cops see "ums" as confessions. No ums.

54:24.678 --> 54:28.468
Eye contact or jail? Answers or jail?

54:31.977 --> 54:34.437
-Well?
-I don't know.

54:34.563 --> 54:35.983
Would you stop being a baby?

54:39.234 --> 54:40.364
Ohh...

54:43.906 --> 54:45.696
What is your problem, glitter bunny?

54:45.824 --> 54:50.834
Chet's supposed to leave, right? No.
He stays. And the Federal Mint car.

54:50.954 --> 54:53.754
This is too much. This is like real crap!

54:53.874 --> 54:56.424
Shut up! You rob trains, too,
so you need to stop whining.

54:56.543 --> 54:57.963
Stop it!

55:04.510 --> 55:05.970
I knew there was money missing.

55:07.262 --> 55:10.182
What the hell? What is this?

55:10.307 --> 55:12.597
Keep your voice down.

55:12.726 --> 55:16.856
-You-- you're taking money?
-Yeah.

55:17.856 --> 55:20.526
This is supposed to be going towards
getting Mom home!

55:20.651 --> 55:24.201
You know what?
We don't have to stop at Mom's bail.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.871
I can make enough money
so that I can go to college,

55:26.990 --> 55:29.620
-I can pay for my first semester.
-That wasn't the plan.

55:29.743 --> 55:31.123
-This is my plan.
-Of course.

55:31.245 --> 55:34.245
-Why can't you see the bigger picture?
-Because I'm not you!

55:34.373 --> 55:37.383
Yeah. You are, all right?
You're a Tanner, too.

55:37.501 --> 55:41.261
We're all part
of the same shitty chunks of DNA!

55:44.925 --> 55:46.835
[sobbing]

55:51.014 --> 55:52.064
Fine.

56:00.274 --> 56:04.194
It says here that your home is
in close proximity

56:04.319 --> 56:07.659
to the Pacific Western railroad
train yard, is that correct?

Welcome back, students.

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:18.014
I know you may think
that your future looks bleak.

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:19.886
You're probably thinking,

01:24:20.013 --> 01:24:25.193
how could a kid like me in a school
like this make anything of myself?

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.980
You're probably thinking
I may as well make meth

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:33.395
or sell my body for money
or start a fight club.

01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:36.067
Or rob a train.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:38.485
But you don't have to do that

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:43.035
because you have the best college
and career planning counselor

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:45.411
in the entire state.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:49.749
Last year, I got one student
into 27 top-tier colleges

01:24:49.876 --> 01:24:51.996
and you idiots can do the same thing!

01:24:52.129 --> 01:24:54.209
With my help, you're all going to college!

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.929
You're going to college!
You're going to college!

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:58.510
You're going to college!

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:01.505
I'm gonna revamp the hell out
of this school! Say it with me!

01:25:01.638 --> 01:25:03.718
College! College!

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:07.559
College! College! College! College!

01:25:07.686 --> 01:25:11.516
Yes! We're gonna do it.
I'm gonna turn this school around.

01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:12.938
Whoo!
