11:04.613 --> 11:08.845
l'm just plum out of ideas.

11:19.293 --> 11:20.093
Well, l think we all know
what happens now.

11:20.093 --> 11:22.755
Well, l think we all know
what happens now.

11:22.796 --> 11:25.392
-Uh, Jeb, don't start.
-Now we all get eaten.

11:25.433 --> 11:26.900
-Jeb?
-What? What?

11:26.935 --> 11:29.129
You don't think people in town
eat animals?

11:29.170 --> 11:31.797
But who would eat a chicken?
Heh heh.

11:31.838 --> 11:34.602
Come on, guys. There must be
something we can do.

11:34.641 --> 11:36.633
What? What could we do?

11:36.677 --> 11:38.506
Ohh...

11:38.544 --> 11:41.742
-This just isn't fair.
-Fair!

11:41.782 --> 11:43.749
Good call, Curly!

11:43.783 --> 11:45.149
-Ollie.
-Ollie.

11:45.185 --> 11:47.119
Uh, what is?

11:47.153 --> 11:49.644
Listen. What would you say
if l told you...

11:49.688 --> 11:52.453
that you could win big money--

11:52.491 --> 11:55.255
and see
beautiful downtown Chugwater--

11:55.294 --> 11:57.524
if you went to the County Fair?

11:57.563 --> 11:59.030
Ohh.

11:59.064 --> 12:00.827
Thank you for your input, but--

12:00.866 --> 12:03.097
Come on! Let the new cow talk!

12:03.137 --> 12:05.830
New cow! New cow! New cow!

12:05.869 --> 12:10.170
Come on, Mrs. C. You've got
a real good-lookin' bunch here.

12:10.209 --> 12:11.937
<i>l see some real potential.</i>

12:11.976 --> 12:13.466
Aw, shucks.

12:13.512 --> 12:15.478
Now, the fair is two weeks away.

12:15.512 --> 12:18.346
l say we go to town, butter up
that sheriff's horse...

12:18.383 --> 12:20.510
and get him
to give us more time.

12:20.552 --> 12:22.782
What are we waitin' for, Maggie?
Let's go.

12:22.821 --> 12:25.288
That's right.
What do you say, Caloway?

12:25.322 --> 12:28.314
Bah! Absolutely not.

12:28.357 --> 12:30.690
l will not abandon Pearl
in her hour of need...

12:30.727 --> 12:32.059
<i>for such a ridiculous plan.</i>

12:32.096 --> 12:35.223
She would be devastated
if she found us missing.

12:35.265 --> 12:37.528
As far as l'm concerned,
that's not an option.

12:37.567 --> 12:40.537
All right. Suit yourself.

12:40.571 --> 12:44.131
Come on, Grace.
We've got a farm to save.

12:46.743 --> 12:50.007
Oh, you'll have to excuse her.
She's just a little tense.

12:50.047 --> 12:53.742
Tense. What's her specialty,
sour cream?

12:55.619 --> 12:57.610
Going to town.

12:57.654 --> 13:00.143
Of all the ill-conceived i--

13:03.692 --> 13:06.593
Now, don't look at me
so crossly.

13:06.628 --> 13:08.062
l know what
you're going to say--

13:08.097 --> 13:10.087
<i>that Maggie and Grace
will need someone...</i>

13:10.131 --> 13:11.529
<i>with my eye for detail...</i>

13:11.565 --> 13:15.525
<i>to keep them
on the straight and narrow.</i>

13:15.570 --> 13:18.504
Say no more. l'll go.

13:18.539 --> 13:21.406
Now, tut tut. No mushy
good-byes, my little ones.

13:21.442 --> 13:25.106
You know how l get
about overly emotional displays.

13:25.146 --> 13:26.942
<i>Ahem. Ladies?</i>

13:28.115 --> 13:29.445
<i>Mrs. C.</i>

13:29.483 --> 13:33.716
Well,
what made you change your mind?

13:33.755 --> 13:36.517
-l'd rather not talk about it.
-lt's a chick thing.

13:39.726 --> 13:41.216
<i>Good luck, girls!</i>

13:41.261 --> 13:43.230
-See ya!
-Bye!

13:43.264 --> 13:46.993
-They're stew meat.
-Hurry back!

She better hurry up
around that mountain...

14:08.453 --> 14:10.215
'cause l cannot take this
much longer.

14:10.254 --> 14:12.622
Maggie, may l be frank?

14:12.659 --> 14:15.558
Only if you let me wear the hat.

14:15.593 --> 14:19.587
Ahem. Lowbrow remarks
may work for you...

14:19.631 --> 14:22.792
but we prefer
the gentle approach.

14:22.832 --> 14:25.301
Well, she better
stick a sock in it soon.

14:25.336 --> 14:28.237
The vultures
are starting to circle.

14:29.606 --> 14:31.768
Hey, she's not dying!

14:42.920 --> 14:44.750
Roger dodger, out like the wind!

14:44.788 --> 14:47.621
Hey, Maggie, Mrs. C?
How do we find...

14:47.657 --> 14:49.592
the sheriff's office
when we get into town?

14:49.626 --> 14:51.253
Elementary, my dear Grace.

14:51.294 --> 14:53.421
lf we find Buck,
we find the sheriff.

14:53.463 --> 14:56.556
That horse is a legend
in his own mind.

14:56.598 --> 14:58.534
<i>Ah ha ha ha ha!</i>

14:58.534 --> 15:00.169
<i>Ah ha ha ha ha!</i>

15:13.548 --> 15:15.949
So, you think
you got the drop on me?

15:15.985 --> 15:17.281
Well, think again.

15:17.318 --> 15:18.615
Wahoo!

15:18.653 --> 15:20.347
<i>Wah! Wah!</i>

15:20.387 --> 15:22.049
<i>Wah!</i>

15:22.090 --> 15:23.853
Yah-hoo! Hyah!

15:26.893 --> 15:28.554
Hmm.

15:28.596 --> 15:29.857
Wooh!

15:31.599 --> 15:32.793
Aah!

15:36.269 --> 15:39.568
Haaay! Jump back! Kiss myself!

15:39.606 --> 15:43.337
<i>Buck. Earth to Buck? Buck!</i>

15:43.377 --> 15:45.776
lt's your move.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.249
Ohh...great.

15:55.887 --> 15:58.756
You were sleep-fighting again.
Almost threw a shoe.

15:58.792 --> 16:00.316
Ohh. Sorry. Heh.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.416
lt just--it seems like
all the other horses...

16:03.460 --> 16:06.022
are out there fighting bad guys
and takin' names!

16:08.266 --> 16:10.532
Uhh! Who put this here?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.798
Oh, Buck,
this ain't no Dodge City...

16:12.837 --> 16:15.031
but we get our share
of excitement.

16:15.073 --> 16:16.597
<i>Hey, sheriff!</i>

16:16.641 --> 16:19.906
<i>Been waitin' a long time

16:21.145 --> 16:24.206
Oh, howdy, Morse.
What you got there?

16:24.249 --> 16:26.580
<i>Hmm. ''Got Evil Eye Joe. Stop.</i>

16:26.617 --> 16:28.848
''Bringing him today. Stop.

16:28.887 --> 16:31.650
Have money ready. Signed, Rico.''

16:33.156 --> 16:36.924
Ha! Oh, yeah!
Rico caught another one already.

16:36.961 --> 16:39.257
Might as well give him
the key to my safe.

16:39.295 --> 16:41.423
You hear that, Rusty?
Rico's comin'.

16:41.465 --> 16:44.195
Yeah, Rico.
l'm old. l ain't deaf.

16:44.233 --> 16:45.758
Boy, wouldn't that be the life?

16:45.803 --> 16:48.169
Ridin' with Rico,
cleanin' up the west.

16:48.205 --> 16:51.070
Kickin' bad-guy behind!
Whoo! Wah-yah!

16:51.105 --> 16:54.338
Watch out, sucker!

17:00.282 --> 17:02.877
All right, girls.
We're goin' in.

17:02.918 --> 17:07.183
Look! There's no fences.

17:07.221 --> 17:09.214
What keeps the people
from roaming?

17:09.258 --> 17:11.089
<i>They appear to be domesticated.</i>

17:11.127 --> 17:13.252
lt doesn't feel dangerous
at all.

17:13.294 --> 17:16.924
lt's perfectly safe.
Quiet as a farm at milkin' time.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.488
What was that?

17:18.531 --> 17:19.965
lt's a gunfight!

17:25.705 --> 17:28.607
-Aah! Hit the dirt!
-Who lives like this?

17:28.642 --> 17:30.304
What do we do? What do we do?

17:30.345 --> 17:31.902
Look,
there's a star on that door!

17:31.946 --> 17:33.778
That must be
the sheriff's office.

-Get those cows off the stage!

17:51.332 --> 17:52.992
Maybe we came at a bad time.

17:53.032 --> 17:55.192
Charge!

17:55.234 --> 17:57.795
Uhh!

17:57.836 --> 18:00.805
Oh! Oh!

18:00.839 --> 18:01.931

-Ha ha ha!

18:01.974 --> 18:06.274

Aah! Oh! Ow! What did l do?

18:28.734 --> 18:30.360
<i>That does it!</i>

18:30.401 --> 18:32.368
<i>Hoof it on out of here, ladies!</i>

18:32.402 --> 18:34.870
-Go on!
-Oh, come back!

18:34.906 --> 18:37.237
That was the best dang show
we ever had!

18:37.274 --> 18:40.005
Aw, you've been on the trail
too long, you old coot.

18:40.044 --> 18:43.034
Ohh. What kind of
sheriff's office is that?

18:43.078 --> 18:44.980
Dancing girls, gambling...

18:45.016 --> 18:47.007
Ha! How does he ever
get any work done?

18:47.050 --> 18:51.511
lf that's the sheriff's office,
this town rocks.

18:52.722 --> 18:55.953
Well, if it isn't
three maids a-milkin'.

18:55.992 --> 18:59.756
You girls a little far
from home, aren't ya?

18:59.794 --> 19:02.094
Well, if it isn't
the phony express.

19:02.132 --> 19:04.998
We want a word with you
about this.

19:06.634 --> 19:08.431
-What's that?
-What is that?

19:08.469 --> 19:11.495
l believe you left this
on our farm.

19:11.540 --> 19:14.066
Wai--whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

19:14.109 --> 19:18.238
The place went bankrupt.
Your farm is history.

19:18.278 --> 19:20.180
Don't you heifers get it?

19:20.215 --> 19:21.910
Hold on, you two!

19:21.950 --> 19:23.111
Give us two more weeks...

19:23.152 --> 19:25.551
and we'll have at least
sixty bucks in prize money to--

19:25.587 --> 19:28.249
Ah-ah-ah. You got three days
to pay or get on your way.

19:28.289 --> 19:30.415
And sixty bucks don't cut it.

19:30.457 --> 19:32.722
Looks like you need about...

19:32.760 --> 19:35.125
Hmm, l'd say...

19:35.162 --> 19:37.756
seven hundred and fifty of 'em.

19:37.798 --> 19:40.232
But, Maggie, where are we
gonna get all that money?

19:40.267 --> 19:44.169
Well, maybe Maggie
can just pull it out of her ear.

19:44.204 --> 19:45.761
Hey, watch it, Caloway.

19:52.178 --> 19:54.145
-Rico.
-Rico.

19:55.616 --> 19:56.742
-Rico.
-Rico.

20:14.431 --> 20:16.400
Who is that?

20:17.769 --> 20:20.236
-Shh.
-Sorry.

20:23.140 --> 20:26.907
Don't you know a hero
when you see one, huh?

20:26.944 --> 20:28.242
That's Rico...

20:28.279 --> 20:31.339
the best dang bounty hunter
this side of the Pecos.

20:31.382 --> 20:33.783
l could guess
from here to tomorrow...

20:33.817 --> 20:35.843
but l don't know
how you do it, Rico.

20:35.887 --> 20:38.354
-Mmf!
-Where's my money?

20:38.388 --> 20:41.824
Well, all right,
l got it right here for you.

20:41.858 --> 20:44.225
Hey, they're giving away
free money!

20:44.261 --> 20:45.489
Oh! Maggie!

20:45.529 --> 20:47.587
So, who else is out there?

20:47.630 --> 20:48.756
The only varmint left...

20:48.798 --> 20:52.096
is that low-down,
good-for-nothin' Alameda Slim.

20:52.134 --> 20:53.831
Cattle rustler.

20:53.871 --> 20:57.328
-What's the bounty?
-$750.

20:57.373 --> 21:00.001
l got it!

21:00.043 --> 21:02.602
Why don't we go nab
that Alameda Slim...

21:02.644 --> 21:05.170
and use the reward money
to save the farm?

21:05.214 --> 21:07.943
Oh, that is a sensible idea.

21:07.983 --> 21:09.952
l knew you'd love it!

21:09.986 --> 21:13.648
Tch. Don't they have sarcasm
where you come from?

21:13.689 --> 21:17.125
Oh, wake up and smell
the alfalfa! lt's perfect!

21:17.159 --> 21:18.717
l'm gonna need a fresh horse.

21:19.927 --> 21:23.863
Hmm, a horse. A horse.

21:23.898 --> 21:25.126
Let me think.

21:25.166 --> 21:28.625
l reckon you'd want
a fast horse, huh? Real fast?

21:28.670 --> 21:30.934
Course, he'd also have
to be able to go...

21:30.972 --> 21:34.462
<i>for days
without food or drink...</i>

21:34.507 --> 21:38.444
<i>stealthy,
sure-footed in any terrain...</i>

21:38.479 --> 21:40.037
<i>Well, huh...</i>

21:40.081 --> 21:42.641
-Look at me!
-What about that horse?

21:42.683 --> 21:45.344
What, you mean Buck here?

21:45.385 --> 21:47.045
-Eee!
-Boy, l don't know.

21:47.087 --> 21:50.681
Buck's fast, all right,
but he's kind of a handful.

21:50.723 --> 21:54.490
-He'll do.
-Well, suit yourself.

21:54.528 --> 21:56.722
Hey, Rusty!

21:56.763 --> 21:59.425
Rico's saddle!
l'm wearing Rico's saddle!

21:59.466 --> 22:01.092
l'm wearing Rico's saddle!

22:01.132 --> 22:03.499
Great. l'll leave you two alone.

22:03.535 --> 22:05.401
Ohh, oh, no. No, no, no.

22:05.438 --> 22:07.429
There is no way
in heaven or earth...

22:07.474 --> 22:09.201
that cows can catch an outlaw.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.004
Look, all we've got to do...

22:11.042 --> 22:14.501
is follow this chuck wagon
to a cattle drive.

22:14.546 --> 22:17.072
Ahh. And then, you see...

22:17.117 --> 22:19.016
we let the bad guys come to us.

22:19.050 --> 22:21.611
Oh! We've
no reason to believe...

22:21.653 --> 22:24.519
this chuck wagon is heading off
to a cattle drive.

22:24.555 --> 22:27.524
Hey, Tommy!
Have fun on that cattle drive!

22:27.558 --> 22:29.583
All right, then. Mm-hmm.

22:29.627 --> 22:32.652
l think it is
headed toward a cattle drive.

22:32.696 --> 22:36.723
Shh. We are not following
this wagon, and that is final.

30:41.959 --> 30:44.257

l lost track of everything.

30:46.930 --> 30:49.627

How about a song?

34:02.616 --> 34:04.243
l'm gonna get you for this.

34:09.688 --> 34:13.350
Ha ha! 5,000 Texas longhorns.

34:13.391 --> 34:16.054
Not bad for one night's work.

34:16.094 --> 34:18.120
<i>Pick a color.</i>

34:18.164 --> 34:21.224
<i>l said,
not bad for one night's work.</i>

34:21.266 --> 34:23.291
-What?
-Thank you.

34:23.333 --> 34:26.235
And judging by the ear mark...

34:26.271 --> 34:30.367
l'd say these are the last
of Big Mike Donald's herd.

34:30.408 --> 34:32.431
Big Mike Donald had a farm?

34:32.476 --> 34:33.966
-E-l-E-l--
-E-l-E-l--

34:34.012 --> 34:35.946
-Ohh...
-Ohh...

34:35.980 --> 34:39.608
That's right. He had a farm.
Heh heh heh.

34:39.650 --> 34:41.380
Now that all his cash cows
have disappeared...

34:41.418 --> 34:43.510
<i>that poor sap's
gonna be flat broke.</i>

34:43.554 --> 34:46.319
<i>Perfect time for a certain
upstanding land owner...</i>

34:46.357 --> 34:48.688
to step in
and take all the land.

34:48.725 --> 34:50.283
Aah! Who are you?

34:50.326 --> 34:52.591
What did you do
with Uncle Slim?

34:52.629 --> 34:55.598
Put up your dukes,
Mr. Fancy Britches.

34:55.630 --> 34:56.895
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah-aah!

34:56.935 --> 34:58.764
lt's me. Hello?

34:58.801 --> 35:00.701
This here
is the disguise l use...

35:00.736 --> 35:02.500
to sneak into
all them auctions...

35:02.539 --> 35:05.974
and buy all the land,
you brainless monotone monkeys.

35:06.008 --> 35:10.001
Shoot, you got to be the richest
land baron in the west.

35:10.046 --> 35:13.141
Yes, but the part
that really warms my heart...

35:13.182 --> 35:15.743
is watching those homesteaders
suffer.

35:18.353 --> 35:19.615
Back in the day, l worked...

35:19.654 --> 35:22.452
the highfalutinest ranches
you ever seen...

35:22.491 --> 35:26.826
but those stuck-up ranch bosses
couldn't appreciate my talents.

35:26.863 --> 35:29.126
Maybe they just didn't like
your singing.

35:29.164 --> 35:32.157
My singing?

35:34.035 --> 35:37.026
Songbirds sing.

35:37.071 --> 35:39.198
<i>Saloon gals sing.</i>

35:39.240 --> 35:43.176
Little bitty snot-nosed
children sing.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.269
l yodel!

35:45.312 --> 35:47.542
And yodeling is an art!

35:47.581 --> 35:50.641
Well, maybe they just
didn't like your yodeling.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.054
He didn't mean it, Uncle Slim.

35:56.090 --> 35:57.614
<i>Everybody likes yodeling.</i>

35:57.658 --> 35:59.489
Hmm?

35:59.527 --> 36:05.259
Why, it's one of the funniest,
cornball, goofy, silly sounds...

36:05.298 --> 36:06.697
in the whole west.

36:06.733 --> 36:09.134
Yaah! Aah! Yaah!

36:12.939 --> 36:15.271
-Uh, Gil?
-Uh-huh?

36:15.308 --> 36:18.368
Am l correct in assuming
that each and every time...

36:18.410 --> 36:21.277
we brought a herd back
to this secret lair...

36:21.313 --> 36:24.770
you've managed to sit
in the exact same spot...

36:24.817 --> 36:28.718
blocking that choice
piece of property from my view?!

36:28.754 --> 36:32.553
This is my comfy place.

36:32.590 --> 36:35.559
What? Aah!

36:35.594 --> 36:37.652
<i>lt's called
Patch of Heaven, Uncle Slim.</i>

36:37.696 --> 36:40.323
Goes on auction
Thursday morning.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.264
Perfect. Pencil it in.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.463
Thursday morning--right after
we sell off this herd.

36:45.503 --> 36:48.163
But it's just
a little old dirt farm.

36:48.204 --> 36:49.605
Ah, what's the difference?

36:49.640 --> 36:56.410
When you're talking revenge,
every last acre counts.

37:12.462 --> 37:13.689
l don't get it.

37:13.729 --> 37:15.856
Weren't the cows
supposed to come back?

37:15.898 --> 37:18.629
Daddy, what's going to happen
if they don't come back?

37:18.667 --> 37:21.227
Oh, but they are coming back.

37:21.271 --> 37:24.363
Hogwash! We all know
they're never coming back.

37:24.405 --> 37:25.929
What? Ooh! Ooh!

37:25.974 --> 37:29.911
You don't know that, Jeb.

37:29.945 --> 37:31.913
Everybody knows that bovines...

37:31.947 --> 37:35.609
are the most intelligent,
crafty animals in the west.

37:35.650 --> 37:37.277
Yeah. He's right, you know.

37:37.317 --> 37:40.014
lt doesn't take a cow
to figure out...

37:40.054 --> 37:41.886
they saw
the writing on the wall...

37:41.923 --> 37:43.982
and flown the coop
while the getting was good.

37:44.025 --> 37:45.082
What?

37:45.125 --> 37:48.151
Oh, no!
They tricked us and deserted us!

37:48.195 --> 37:49.823
No, no. Aud-Audrey.

37:51.132 --> 37:53.725
Excuse me. Excuse me.

37:53.767 --> 37:56.998
Excuse me!

37:59.641 --> 38:03.871
Oh, uh, let's not forget
who we're talkin' 'bout.

38:03.909 --> 38:06.937
Audrey, remember when
Grace helped you figure out...

38:06.981 --> 38:09.345
<i>why you crossed the road?</i>

38:09.381 --> 38:12.977
And, Jeb, Miss Caloway
knew just what to do...

38:13.019 --> 38:15.145
when your head got stuck
in that spittoon.

38:15.186 --> 38:16.313
Get off my case!

38:16.355 --> 38:19.346
And Maggie
was gonna make us all winners.

38:19.391 --> 38:22.189
l truly believe
there ain't nothin'...

38:22.227 --> 38:24.627
those three cows can't do.

38:32.003 --> 38:33.163
Aw...

38:33.204 --> 38:37.107
Well, whatever they're gonna do,
they better do it soon.

38:37.143 --> 38:41.340
l'm so very sorry, Pearl.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.836
lt's a real shame. lt is.

38:51.322 --> 38:53.313
Ollie,
l don't know what's worse--

38:53.357 --> 38:56.189
losing my farm
to the highest bidder...

38:56.225 --> 39:01.755
or knowing that--that my girls
are lost and alone out there.

39:05.702 --> 39:08.135
-Yee-haw!
-Come on, girls.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.538
Either
l'm getting good at this...

39:10.574 --> 39:12.064
or his scent
is getting stronger.

39:12.109 --> 39:14.702
Go get him, Maggie.
Look out, Slim!

39:14.744 --> 39:18.144
-No. lt can't be.
-We're on your trail!

39:18.180 --> 39:19.944
Hmm.

39:34.262 --> 39:35.752
Hoo hoo!

39:39.200 --> 39:40.667
<i>Oops.</i>

39:40.702 --> 39:42.931
<i>This has Buck
written all over it.</i>

39:42.970 --> 39:45.804
We're not gonna let
this dumb old trick stop us.

39:45.840 --> 39:49.708
Sooner or later, all these paths
will hook up, and then...

39:51.144 --> 39:53.705
<i>Oh, no, the tracks!</i>

39:53.748 --> 39:55.442
Hurry up, girls.
Don't lose that trail.

39:55.482 --> 39:58.509
What trail?
l can't see anything.

40:00.086 --> 40:01.950
Look out!

40:03.823 --> 40:06.553
Oh! Flash flood!

40:06.593 --> 40:08.619
Get to high ground!

40:11.865 --> 40:14.356
-Oh.
-Maggie!

40:16.436 --> 40:18.402
Oh!

40:46.164 --> 40:47.323
Maggie!

41:01.278 --> 41:05.908
No! Come on, girls,
we can't give up!

41:05.948 --> 41:09.441
Maggie, that's enough.
The minute this lets up...

41:09.486 --> 41:12.511
we're heading straight home
to Patch of Heaven.

41:12.555 --> 41:15.456
But what about catching Slim
and collecting the reward?

41:15.491 --> 41:16.856
We never had a prayer...

41:16.892 --> 41:18.292
of catching Slim
in the first place.

41:18.328 --> 41:19.956
<i>This whole ridiculous plan...</i>

41:19.997 --> 41:24.159
is just so you can get revenge
on those cattle rustlers.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.465
Hey!
For your information, duchess...

41:27.503 --> 41:30.802
this whole ridiculous plan
is about us saving our farm.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.307
Huh. Our farm might've had
a fighting chance...

41:33.341 --> 41:34.603
until you came along.

41:34.642 --> 41:36.337
What's that supposed to mean?

41:36.377 --> 41:39.837
Strutting around with
your vulgar show-cow behavior.

41:39.882 --> 41:41.075
Look, l was just having--

41:41.115 --> 41:43.709
<i>Wasting our time
on your foolish plans.</i>

41:43.751 --> 41:45.514
Through the years,
Patch of Heaven...

41:45.553 --> 41:48.181
has survived every hardship
that nature can dish out...

41:48.223 --> 41:49.350
but you, Maggie...

41:49.390 --> 41:53.257
are the biggest catastrophe
to ever hit our farm.

41:53.293 --> 41:55.353
Well, if that's the way
you feel about it...

41:55.396 --> 41:57.694
maybe we should just go
our separate ways.

41:57.732 --> 41:59.823
Now, that's the first
good idea you've ever had.

41:59.866 --> 42:01.062
-Fine!
-Fine!

42:01.102 --> 42:03.296
-Fine!
-Fine!

42:11.778 --> 42:15.406
Yeah. Fine.

42:15.448 --> 42:17.212
lt's not like your farm...

42:17.250 --> 42:20.219
was ever gonna feel like home
to me anyways.

-Wake up.
-Check, please!

45:13.515 --> 45:15.679
lt tasted a lot better
in my sleep.

45:15.719 --> 45:18.846
Well, l suppose
you'll be off now.

45:18.888 --> 45:21.686
-Mm-hmm.
-Where will you go?

45:21.724 --> 45:24.283
Oh, probably check out
the Grand Canyon.

45:24.326 --> 45:26.260
See Utah before l die.

45:26.295 --> 45:28.491
Wait a minute. Where's Grace?

45:28.532 --> 45:31.328
Hi, there.
Boy, am l glad you guys are up.

45:31.366 --> 45:33.129
Hey, come look at this.

45:33.168 --> 45:36.195
What on earth?
Where did all this come from?

45:36.238 --> 45:40.435
Hey, it's green, it's leafy,
and it's free. Shut up and eat.

45:40.475 --> 45:42.102
Good morning, ladies.

45:42.143 --> 45:43.769
l see you're already
tucked into your appetizer.

45:43.811 --> 45:46.076
Never knew a pretty lady
that didn't have an appetite.

45:46.114 --> 45:48.105
Oh, now, see here, you ruffian--

45:48.148 --> 45:50.548
He's not a ruffian,
Mrs. Caloway.

45:50.584 --> 45:55.079
He's a genuine desert shaman--
our very own wise man.

45:55.123 --> 45:57.614
Shaman, chef, chief cook,
and bottle washer.

45:57.658 --> 46:00.525
l'm a jackrabbit of all trades
and at your service.

46:00.561 --> 46:03.053
Folks around these parts
call me Lucky Jack.

46:03.098 --> 46:05.657
Yep, they used to come
from miles around...

46:05.699 --> 46:08.394
just to get one rub
of my lucky rabbit's foot.

46:08.434 --> 46:10.403
Whoo! Dagnabit!

46:14.341 --> 46:16.934
This happens all the time.
Now, where was l?

46:16.976 --> 46:19.466
Ah. Voila.

46:19.511 --> 46:21.537
<i>Now let me just
get this on the fire...</i>

46:21.581 --> 46:23.879
and it'll be ready directly.

46:23.916 --> 46:26.579
Mm-huh. Ow! Yow!

46:26.620 --> 46:28.519
Look, we don't eat meat.

46:28.553 --> 46:30.612
lt's kind of like
a professional courtesy.

46:30.655 --> 46:32.920
Perhaps we'll dine with you
some other time.

46:32.959 --> 46:35.426
You see, Grace and l
are returning to our farm...

46:35.460 --> 46:37.394
to say our last good-byes.

46:37.429 --> 46:40.298
Yeah. We need closure.

46:40.334 --> 46:42.458
Well, l can sympathize there,
sister, l truly can.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.730
Until recently,
l, too, had a home.

46:44.769 --> 46:46.464
Echo Mine it was called.

46:46.505 --> 46:51.000
Us jackrabbits lived there
for generation after generation.

46:51.042 --> 46:54.874
Till some land-grabbing bandit
moved in...

46:54.911 --> 46:58.905
and flushed us out
like yesterday's oatmeal.

46:58.950 --> 47:03.249
Ahem. Excuse us. My good fellow,
we must be on our way.

47:03.287 --> 47:05.150
Wait! There he is!

47:09.026 --> 47:11.254
Aah!

47:11.293 --> 47:14.423
Slim! You mean
this no-good varmint...

47:14.465 --> 47:17.297
is hiding out in Echo Mine
right now?

47:17.333 --> 47:20.096
-Without a doubt.
-Maggie, what are you thinking?

47:20.136 --> 47:23.902
Look, l got a score to settle
with that rhinestone fat boy...

47:23.940 --> 47:25.134
and nothing to lose.

47:25.175 --> 47:28.041
But it'll be dangerous going
after Slim all by yourself.

47:28.076 --> 47:30.670
Hey, l got the rabbit.

47:30.711 --> 47:34.649
That's not all you got, Maggie.
You got us.

47:34.684 --> 47:37.175
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

47:37.220 --> 47:39.813
We are sticking to our plan
and going home.

47:39.854 --> 47:42.015
Hold on, you two.

47:42.056 --> 47:46.460
As strange as this sounds,
Grace is actually making sense.

47:46.495 --> 47:48.688
-Thank you.
-You want the money...

47:48.728 --> 47:50.629
and l want to get even
with Slim.

47:50.665 --> 47:52.792
The three of us go together,
and we're sure to get him.

47:52.833 --> 47:56.634
Once you collect the reward,
l'll walk out your front gate...

47:56.671 --> 48:00.004
and l'll stay out of it forever.
Deal?

48:01.375 --> 48:06.334
Your powers of persuasion
are uncanny. Deal.

48:06.379 --> 48:09.907
Ha! Bovine bounty hunters!
Now l've seen everything.

48:09.951 --> 48:10.016
Let's get moving, ladies.

48:10.016 --> 48:11.814
Let's get moving, ladies.

48:11.853 --> 48:17.312
Time for an underground
smackdown. Yee-haw!

-Who am l?
-Uncle Slim?

48:47.084 --> 48:49.054
Correct! Heh.

48:49.088 --> 48:51.611
Now, l put on my hat...

48:51.655 --> 48:54.591
then l put on my spectacles--

48:54.626 --> 48:57.686
-Aah! Hey! Who're you?
-Where's Uncle Slim?

48:57.729 --> 49:01.028
Ohh! lt's still me!

49:01.065 --> 49:03.191
Can't you stupid
sack of hammers get it right?

49:04.401 --> 49:07.235
Oh, the ever-punctual
Mr. Weaseley.

49:07.272 --> 49:10.171
<i>OK, everybody make way...</i>

49:10.206 --> 49:12.801

49:22.318 --> 49:23.877
-Aah!
-Hey, who're you?

49:23.921 --> 49:25.855
<i>All right, come on!</i>

49:25.888 --> 49:28.321
<i>Move it, Bessie, or
l'll tan your hides right here.</i>

49:28.357 --> 49:31.223
l--hey, hey, hey!
Watch the suit! Watch the suit!

49:31.260 --> 49:32.487
Feast your eyes.

49:32.528 --> 49:36.896
5,000 cows on the barrelhead
as promised, Mr. Weaseley.

49:36.931 --> 49:38.957
The name's Wesley.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.094
So, Slim, what do you say
we get a move on...

49:41.136 --> 49:44.003
and load these cash cows
onto the train A.S.A.P., huh?

49:44.039 --> 49:45.165
Let's go.

49:45.206 --> 49:50.075
Yes, yes, of course. Just as
soon as l finish counting. Hmm.

49:55.215 --> 49:57.580
<i>Lucky Jack, you did it!
We're here!</i>

49:57.617 --> 50:00.087
<i>Well,
l take my hat off to you, Jack.</i>

50:00.121 --> 50:01.781
But you've got us here
in one piece.

50:01.822 --> 50:03.483
Well, seein' is believin'.

50:03.524 --> 50:05.583
And l don't believe what l see.

50:05.626 --> 50:06.853
<i>Oh, it's Buck!</i>

50:06.893 --> 50:08.861
<i>Stallion of the Cim-moron.</i>

50:08.895 --> 50:10.329
l'm supposed to be here
just in case...

50:10.364 --> 50:11.593
one of the horses get tired.

50:11.632 --> 50:12.860
Cows only.

50:12.900 --> 50:15.629
Look, friend, you don't
understand my situation.

50:15.669 --> 50:18.831
No, you don't understand...

50:18.870 --> 50:20.964
<i>so l'll say it again.</i>

50:21.007 --> 50:24.443
<i>The only critters
that get by me are cows.</i>

50:24.477 --> 50:26.877
<i>Cows only.</i>

50:26.913 --> 50:30.040
Oh, come on!
Look, cut me a break.

50:30.082 --> 50:31.310
Now what?

50:31.350 --> 50:33.318
Aww, what are you doing here?

50:33.352 --> 50:36.481
Ha ha! Sorry we're late.
We got separated from the herd.

50:36.522 --> 50:38.490
Right this way, little lady.

50:38.524 --> 50:40.186
Tell 'em Junior sent you.

50:40.226 --> 50:41.920
Ohhh...

50:41.960 --> 50:43.188
-Howdy, partner!
-Ahem.

50:43.228 --> 50:46.686
-Nice hat, ma'am.
-Oh! Cheeky devil.

50:46.731 --> 50:49.859
Excuse me, reject.
Coming through.

50:49.900 --> 50:52.527
Oh! Hey, what gives?!

50:52.570 --> 50:54.231
How come
they got to go through?

50:54.272 --> 50:55.829
They're cows.

50:55.872 --> 50:57.807
What?!
But what about the rabbit?

50:57.842 --> 51:00.709
Well, obviously,
he was with the cows.

51:00.745 --> 51:02.975
Ha! l'm with the cows, too!

51:03.014 --> 51:06.210
Yeah! Hey! Hey, cows! W-wait up!

51:06.249 --> 51:08.273
You got to tell this guy
you know me!

51:08.317 --> 51:09.718
See, Junior, we're old friends!

51:09.754 --> 51:13.883
Come on, Margie! Uh, Gretchen!
Miss, uh--uh, Hat Cow!

51:13.923 --> 51:16.551
Come on,
it's your old pal Buck, see?

51:16.593 --> 51:18.560
Buck...Buck...

51:18.594 --> 51:20.721
Oh, Buck!

51:20.763 --> 51:22.231
Nah, doesn't ring a bell.

51:22.265 --> 51:24.927
No, no, no, wait!
Hey, come back! No!

51:24.969 --> 51:27.629
Hang on--hang on a second.
Heh heh heh.

51:27.669 --> 51:29.728
They're just kidding.
You see, if you could--

51:29.772 --> 51:33.504
Oh, hey! Hey!
Hey, cows! Cows! Oof!

51:33.543 --> 51:35.533
Don't make me hurt you.

51:35.577 --> 51:37.238
Heh heh.

51:39.314 --> 51:42.112
Rico.

51:42.151 --> 51:46.086
l gotta go, but let's throw on
the old feedbag sometime.

51:46.120 --> 51:49.521
Stay cool.
Ha ha ha! lt's hero time.

51:51.926 --> 51:53.484
So what's the plan?

51:53.528 --> 51:55.392
Well, let's see...

51:55.429 --> 51:57.763
You two get his attention
while l sneak up behind him...

51:57.800 --> 51:59.391
and then
l'll knock him into the cart...

51:59.435 --> 52:01.924
and then we'll rope him up
and wheel him to justice!

52:01.968 --> 52:03.435
And for extra measure...

52:03.470 --> 52:05.961
how about we conk him
on the noggin with this?

52:06.006 --> 52:08.237
You go, cowgirl!
That's usin' the old hat.

52:08.276 --> 52:10.836
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now, you lost me here, missy.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.810
Look, Jack, it's simple.

52:12.845 --> 52:16.612
Cart, smack, rope, roll,
justice. Come on, Jack, focus.

52:16.650 --> 52:20.108
<i>Now is not the time to get
all scatterbrained and flaky.</i>

52:25.424 --> 52:27.790
Oh, good, l'm not too late.

52:27.827 --> 52:30.057
Sorry. Still stakin' out
your quarry, huh?

52:30.096 --> 52:31.563
Yeah, pretty much. Why?

52:31.596 --> 52:35.556
Listen, l came to warn you, one
equine to another, about Rico.

52:35.601 --> 52:37.262
As soon as he nabs
that rustler...

52:37.302 --> 52:39.271
he's gonna be in a big hurry
to collect that reward.

52:39.305 --> 52:40.828
-So?
-So?!

52:40.872 --> 52:43.807
Once he catches his man, that's
when the horsewhip comes out...

52:43.843 --> 52:45.435
and he's not shy
about using it, either!

52:45.479 --> 52:46.944
-Horsewhip?
-Horsewhip!

52:46.978 --> 52:49.137
And not only are you
gonna be carrying Rico...

52:49.178 --> 52:50.477
but that rustler as well.

52:50.515 --> 52:52.107
Have you seen that guy?
He's huge!

52:52.151 --> 52:53.276
What should l do?

52:53.317 --> 52:54.511
-Run!
-OK.

52:54.551 --> 52:56.283
Yeah, run like the wind,
partner, and save yourself!

52:56.323 --> 52:57.448
l'm going!

52:57.490 --> 53:00.183
Go on, take off! Fade!
Ride into the sunset!

53:00.223 --> 53:02.557
-All righty, l'm outta here!
-Aah! Scram!

53:02.594 --> 53:04.289
OK, thanks, buddy!
l owe you one!

53:04.329 --> 53:05.920
Godspeed, my friend!

53:05.963 --> 53:08.023
So long, sucker! Ha ha!

53:08.066 --> 53:11.090
He must be takin' stupid lessons
from that buffalo.

53:11.134 --> 53:13.159
Uh-oh.

53:13.202 --> 53:16.262
<i>-1,420...
-4,334...</i>

53:16.305 --> 53:18.433

53:25.214 --> 53:27.614
-Ohh!
-4,337...

53:27.649 --> 53:29.516
Can't you morons
count to yourselves?

53:29.552 --> 53:30.678
Come on.

53:30.720 --> 53:32.187
Gotta start all over!

53:32.220 --> 53:34.688
-There he is.
-Come on, let's go!

53:34.723 --> 53:36.087
Hold on!

53:36.124 --> 53:38.820
You're both forgetting
Slim's hypnotic control...

53:38.860 --> 53:40.920
over those
with less than perfect pitch.

53:40.963 --> 53:42.487
Jack, l hope you can forgive me.

53:42.531 --> 53:44.829
-For what, missy? Aah!
-For that.

53:44.866 --> 53:45.924
Now, you watch it there, toots!

53:47.668 --> 53:50.194
Grace, how practical!

53:50.239 --> 53:51.900
Done countin'!

53:51.941 --> 53:55.637
-What do we got?
-4,997.

53:55.677 --> 53:57.906
-What?
-Huh? Wait, wait, what?

53:57.945 --> 53:59.810
l thought you said 5,000 even.

53:59.847 --> 54:03.078
Of course l did. Gil must've
just miscounted, that's all.

54:03.117 --> 54:04.310
Huh?

54:04.351 --> 54:06.877
<i>There's one up there!</i>

54:06.921 --> 54:08.980
The others can't be far behind.

54:09.023 --> 54:10.684
<i>Just you watch.</i>

54:10.723 --> 54:14.181
You're gonna like this.
Yodeling's an art.

54:14.227 --> 54:16.127
Ahem.

54:25.172 --> 54:26.433
Huh?

54:32.377 --> 54:35.905
Ha ha ha!
What's the deal, Slimbo?

54:35.949 --> 54:38.543
Maybe she wasn't an art lover.

54:38.584 --> 54:39.710
Philistine!

54:39.751 --> 54:42.276
Shut up, you greenhorns!

54:42.321 --> 54:45.779
A bovine ain't been born
that can resist my charms.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.620
Ahem.

54:56.001 --> 54:58.058
Watch your back, Uncle Slim!

54:58.101 --> 55:02.130
Got you!
Where do you think you're going?

55:03.974 --> 55:05.636
Ooh!

55:05.676 --> 55:07.267
-Now, Jack!
-OK!

55:07.310 --> 55:09.938
What in the rootin'-tootin'
blazes is goin' on here?!

55:09.980 --> 55:11.471

l guess l gotta do everything
around here myself!

58:13.354 --> 58:17.585
Call me crazy, but l think
these cows got it in for me.

58:17.624 --> 58:19.956
Maybe they just don't like
your singing.

58:19.994 --> 58:21.824
Shut up! Ahem.

58:21.861 --> 58:25.389
Mr. Weaseley,
my money, if you please.

58:25.433 --> 58:28.229
Heh heh heh. l was just
keeping it safe for you, Slim.

58:28.267 --> 58:29.393
Sure you were.

58:29.435 --> 58:32.963
<i>Protecting my investments
is what l pay this fellow for.</i>

58:33.006 --> 58:34.803
Mr. Weaseley, let me present...

58:34.841 --> 58:38.139
the most traitorous,
double-crossin' gun for hire...

58:38.177 --> 58:42.477
<i>that l've ever had the pleasure
to call partner--Rico.</i>

58:42.514 --> 58:44.881
You're too kind, boss.

58:44.917 --> 58:46.816
No, it can't be.

58:46.851 --> 58:49.946
His reputation as
a bounty hunter is well-known...

58:49.988 --> 58:52.821
but lately he's been doing
a little moonlighting...

58:52.858 --> 58:54.721
and covering my tracks.

58:54.758 --> 58:57.388
Rico's going to see you
to the border...

58:57.429 --> 59:01.022
so that nothing else goes wrong.

59:01.065 --> 59:03.124
Tck-tck.

59:03.168 --> 59:05.794
Now, if you'll all pardon me...

59:05.836 --> 59:08.067
there's
a little Patch of Heaven...

59:08.105 --> 59:10.095
on the auction block
this morning.

59:10.140 --> 59:13.770
He's going to buy our farm!

59:13.811 --> 59:17.473
Adios! Yee-haw!

59:17.514 --> 59:20.074
l don't know
how you got here, skittish...

59:20.116 --> 59:22.208
but stick with me,
and you may get to like...

59:22.252 --> 59:24.516
the other side of the law.

59:24.554 --> 59:26.885
Get on there! Hyah!

59:26.922 --> 59:28.446
<i>All right, come on! Come on!</i>

59:28.492 --> 59:30.790
<i>Move it, Bessie! Get in there!</i>

59:30.827 --> 59:32.691
Hurry up!
You don't want to be late...

59:32.728 --> 59:34.127
for that big round-up
in the sky!

59:35.698 --> 59:40.294
Hah! Skittish, whoa!

59:40.336 --> 59:42.462
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

59:42.504 --> 59:46.373
Get in there!
Come on, you stupid cows!

59:46.408 --> 59:47.636
Come on!

59:47.676 --> 59:50.337
Unh!

59:50.378 --> 59:52.539
<i>Lovely.
Now get the engine fired up...</i>

59:52.580 --> 59:53.978
<i>and let's make tracks.</i>

59:55.618 --> 59:57.414
Huh?

59:57.452 --> 59:59.975
<i>Make a break for it,
ladies! Run!</i>

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.546
Whoa! Hah! Skittish, whoa!

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:04.682
Buck, have you gone crazy?!

01:00:04.725 --> 01:00:07.752
Now, that's entirely possible!
Yo!

01:00:07.795 --> 01:00:12.232
Or maybe l just figured out
who the real heroes are!

01:00:12.266 --> 01:00:14.894
Wait! What if this is
some kind of trick?

01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:17.402
Whoo! Whassah!

01:00:17.437 --> 01:00:21.601
Oh, this isn't a trick!
lt's a miracle! Come on!

01:00:23.142 --> 01:00:25.543
So you think
you got the drop on me...

01:00:25.579 --> 01:00:27.546
well, think again! Hyah!

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.549
Oh!

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:32.848
Whassah!

01:00:32.886 --> 01:00:36.116
-Whoo!
-Unh...

01:00:37.122 --> 01:00:38.488
This is useless.

01:00:38.524 --> 01:00:42.051
Let's put our heads together.
More brains and less brawn.

01:00:42.094 --> 01:00:43.585
All right!

01:00:45.764 --> 01:00:49.359
Grr!

01:00:49.402 --> 01:00:53.633
OK, Caloway, fetch!

01:00:59.578 --> 01:01:01.569
-Kaboosh!
-Hyah!

01:01:07.952 --> 01:01:10.148
Oof! Unh!

01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:12.314
Ha! Lucky shot!

01:01:12.356 --> 01:01:15.051
Mother of mercy.
ls this the end of Rico?

01:01:16.962 --> 01:01:18.896
Uh...ha...

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:21.522
Wow! Bravo!

01:01:21.564 --> 01:01:23.794
Bravo! You stopped Rico cold!

01:01:23.834 --> 01:01:26.165
Aw, shucks. T'weren't nothin'.

01:01:26.202 --> 01:01:28.602
Fat lot of good it done us.

01:01:28.639 --> 01:01:31.766
Alameda Slim
has already flown the coop.

01:01:31.808 --> 01:01:33.070
She's right.

01:01:33.108 --> 01:01:36.635
Unless we sprout wings, we'll
never make it back in time.

01:01:36.678 --> 01:01:38.442
l can't believe
what l'm hearing.

01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:41.678
This train
goes right by Patch of Heaven.

01:01:41.718 --> 01:01:44.015
What is in the cud
you've been chewin'?

01:01:44.052 --> 01:01:46.850
How are we supposed
to drive that thing?

01:01:46.888 --> 01:01:50.483
How? How? l'll tell you how!

01:01:50.525 --> 01:01:53.859
The same way we walked off
the farm into the unknown.

01:01:53.896 --> 01:01:57.489
The same way we fought off
those burly barmaids.

01:01:57.531 --> 01:02:01.558
And the same way we braved
the western wilderness...

01:02:01.603 --> 01:02:04.539
without the benefit
of food or water.

01:02:04.574 --> 01:02:09.566
We caught Slim once,
and we shall do it again!

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:11.009
Who's with me?

01:02:13.214 --> 01:02:17.513
Get out of here, you bulls!
Head for the hills! Whoo!

01:02:23.724 --> 01:02:25.189
Unh!

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.824
-Let's get it on!
-Cows rule!

01:02:29.863 --> 01:02:32.161
<i>Howdy, darlin'! Down here!</i>

01:02:32.197 --> 01:02:35.224
Yeah! Look--look down!
Hello there!

01:02:35.267 --> 01:02:36.393
Oh, no!

01:02:36.435 --> 01:02:40.872
l got two words for you guys--
cold shower!

01:02:40.906 --> 01:02:42.965
We don't have time
for this nonsense!

01:02:43.008 --> 01:02:44.406
We have a farm to save!

01:02:44.442 --> 01:02:47.743
-Well, maybe we can help you.
-Maybe we can help each--oof!

01:02:47.781 --> 01:02:50.543
-Other!
-Ohh!

01:02:50.582 --> 01:02:52.947
Bye!
Come up and see us sometime!

01:02:52.984 --> 01:02:54.144
Grace!

01:03:03.761 --> 01:03:07.253
Oh, no!
lt's the Morning Express!

01:03:07.297 --> 01:03:08.765
There's a switch up ahead!

01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:11.394
Way ahead of you, pops!
Hop on!

01:03:11.436 --> 01:03:14.562
-Come on, mule!
-Let's ride!

01:03:16.239 --> 01:03:17.706
<i>Yee-haw!</i>

01:03:19.377 --> 01:03:21.037
Ha! Ha!

01:03:26.983 --> 01:03:30.885
-Whoa!
-Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:32.114
Aah!

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:38.549
Roadhogs!

01:03:39.962 --> 01:03:41.088
Aah!

See you back at the farm, girls!

01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:44.597
<i>Good luck!</i>

to Mr. Yancy O'Del.

01:03:56.712 --> 01:04:00.339
Pleasure doing business
with you. Heh heh heh.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:03.748
O'Del's the name,
foreclosure's the game.

01:04:03.785 --> 01:04:06.548
Well,
just set yourself over yonder.

01:04:06.587 --> 01:04:10.989
Sign this deed,
and the property is all yours.

01:04:11.023 --> 01:04:12.581
<i>Much obliged, sheriff.</i>

01:04:12.625 --> 01:04:15.254
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

01:04:19.066 --> 01:04:22.126
-There it is!
-Home and hearth!

01:04:22.169 --> 01:04:25.433
And a holy hallelujah

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:27.439
-Oh, quick, the brakes!
-No time for that!

01:04:27.473 --> 01:04:30.442
-But won't we jump the tracks?
-We are makin' our own tracks!

01:04:30.476 --> 01:04:31.911
This is going to be messy!

01:04:38.317 --> 01:04:43.755
Hee hee hee! The whole territory
belongs to me. Huh?

01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:45.484
Five cents for these chicks.

01:04:45.525 --> 01:04:48.493
Come on, now,
do l hear two cents?

01:04:48.527 --> 01:04:49.790
-Behind you!
-B-behind you!

01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:53.127
Whoa! Whoa! Hold your britches!

Whoa! Run for your lives!

01:04:58.537 --> 01:05:00.163
Watch yourself!

01:05:04.709 --> 01:05:08.610
What's the idea of crashing
your train on my property?

01:05:08.646 --> 01:05:10.135
What? Uh...

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.206
lt can't be!

01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:29.655
Hold it right there!

Owww!

01:05:46.348 --> 01:05:50.148
Oh, come on! Ow! Oof!

01:05:50.185 --> 01:05:53.881
You wanna get nuts?
Let's get nuts!

01:05:53.921 --> 01:05:55.049
Ow! Aah!

01:05:56.257 --> 01:05:58.088
Aaah!

01:05:58.124 --> 01:06:00.890
Ohhhh! Oof!

01:06:03.531 --> 01:06:07.490
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

01:06:07.535 --> 01:06:09.229
lt's Alameda Slim!

01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:11.329
You think you've won?

01:06:11.372 --> 01:06:14.466
lt ain't over
till the fat man sings!

01:06:29.389 --> 01:06:32.516
Alameda Slim,
you're under arrest.

01:06:33.927 --> 01:06:37.089
Nobody messes
with Pearl's girls!

01:06:37.129 --> 01:06:39.461
-Say, girls, got milk?
-Buck!

01:06:39.498 --> 01:06:40.624
Just kidding.

01:06:41.834 --> 01:06:46.134
Take him away, boys!
Hope you like stripes.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:49.972
Pearl, your cows can't do much
with Slim's reward money.

01:06:50.009 --> 01:06:51.771
<i>Think you can find
some use for it?</i>

01:06:51.809 --> 01:06:54.779
Whoo-eee! My farm is saved!

01:06:54.813 --> 01:06:55.939
Awww!

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:05.150
Where's Maggie?

01:07:14.564 --> 01:07:17.557
l can't believe she just left.

01:07:17.602 --> 01:07:19.830
l'm gonna miss her.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.462
So shall l, Grace.

01:07:21.505 --> 01:07:24.168
Her brash manner,
her bullheadedness.

01:07:24.208 --> 01:07:28.575
She risked her life for us,
and who are we but strangers?

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:33.105
We were privileged to know her.
She was a cow like no other!

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:36.914
Right down to her appalling
bodily eruptions.

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:40.611
-Ahh, that was good!
-Maggie!

01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:43.022
l was just having
one for the road...

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.857

all the nice stuff...

01:07:44.895 --> 01:07:46.861
you guys were saying about me.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.591
You know, maybe l could
hang around a while.

01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:51.599
-How about forever?
-Oh!

01:07:51.633 --> 01:07:54.727
Hmm.
Well, it's your call, Caloway.

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.635
ls this barnyard big enough
for the both of us?

01:07:57.672 --> 01:08:00.936
Only if you let me wear the hat.

01:08:00.975 --> 01:08:02.966
Yee-haw!

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.206
Come on, move your hides, girls.

01:08:05.246 --> 01:08:07.839
Last one to the barn
sleeps standing up!

01:08:07.881 --> 01:08:10.181
Awww.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:10.386
OK, everyone, big smiles!

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:12.250
