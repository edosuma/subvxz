WEBVTT

00:54.179 --> 00:58.892
Ah, Cham Syndulla,
the liberator of Ryloth.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.312
Now the traitor of Ryloth.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.023
Attempting to assassinate
your own senator?

01:05.106 --> 01:07.359
How unfortunate for your people
to see you fall.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.736
They won't believe your lies.

01:09.819 --> 01:13.656
Taa said you'd be a challenge,
but he was mistaken.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.993
Your loyal followers will be even easier
to deal with.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.370
Your daughter too.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.792
Surely you know how dangerous
it can be out there.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.461
You don't know Hera.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.090
Eleni, you're the reasonable one.

01:30.173 --> 01:33.677
Tell us where she is and I will ensure
she is returned to you safely.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.015
I have seen
how you treat your allies, Admiral.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.601
I prefer to be your enemy.

01:43.728 --> 01:44.729
Have it your way.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.246
Scour the entire planet if you have to.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.457
I want all of Syndulla's sympathizers
found and arrested.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.127
Sir, the people are not insurgents.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.796
We have no cause to arrest them.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.340
They're supporting a menace.

02:12.424 --> 02:16.469
Syndulla's forces attacked our transport
and shot Senator Taa.

02:16.553 --> 02:17.846
I was there.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.932
That blast didn't come from
Cham or his fighters.

02:21.599 --> 02:22.642
Is that so?

02:23.601 --> 02:27.439
Then please enlighten me.
Who is responsible?

02:28.231 --> 02:31.151
I don't know, sir.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.362
Leave the thinking to me, Captain.

02:34.446 --> 02:35.822
You have your orders.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.077
Yes, sir.
I'll locate Hera Syndulla myself.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.497
That's not necessary.
Another squad is handling that.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.042
It's only a matter of time
before she's found.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.975
Chopper. Shh. I'm here. Hang on.

03:15.653 --> 03:16.988
We searched the house.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.074
The Syndulla girl's gone.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.992
She could've already fled the planet.

03:21.076 --> 03:24.621
Not without her parents. Find her.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.172
New plan, Chop. Meet me at the base.

03:34.255 --> 03:37.092
We need to send out a transmission,
and fast.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.561
Uh-oh.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.979
What's going on here?

03:50.563 --> 03:53.942
Gonky's prime power source
won't fully charge. I'm fixing it.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.736
You can't. He's a defective unit.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.071
Hunter.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.659
Don't worry, we're defective too.

04:03.284 --> 04:08.081
We are receiving a recorded transmission,
but I do not recognize this frequency.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.165
Patch it through.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.294
Omega, it's Hera.
You have to come back to Ryloth.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.672
-Isn't she the kid from the weapons drop?
-

04:15.755 --> 04:16.589
Hera?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.010
The Empire's taken my parents,
and they're after me now too.

04:20.593 --> 04:24.973
I'm sending coordinates.
Please hurry. I need your help.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.142
You gave her our comm channel?

04:27.225 --> 04:30.270
For emergencies,
and that sounded pretty urgent.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.354
We have to go.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.525
Perhaps the situation
is not as dire as described.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.360
Children often overreact.

04:37.444 --> 04:41.197
No, we don't. You heard her. She needs us.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.743
Omega, it's a big galaxy.

04:45.410 --> 04:49.330
We can't put ourselves on the line
every time someone's in trouble.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.750
Why not? Isn't that what soldiers do?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.218
What's his problem?

05:43.301 --> 05:44.552
Thank you for coming.

05:45.970 --> 05:47.514
I wasn't sure you would.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.933
You said you were in trouble.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.477
Care to tell us
why the Empire is after you?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.979
Because my father is Cham Syndulla.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.524
The freedom fighter?

05:57.607 --> 06:00.944
Yes. This was his old command outpost.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.821
It's where I've been hiding.

06:02.904 --> 06:06.366
The Empire's begun targeting
anyone loyal to him.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.493
What do you want us to do?

06:08.576 --> 06:12.372
Free my parents from the Capitol.
That's where they're being held.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.127
They can pay you if you get them out.

06:17.669 --> 06:21.214
Please. I don't have anyone else to ask.

06:29.139 --> 06:33.351
Let's see what we're up against first.
But no guarantees.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.414
Citizens of Ryloth,

06:54.497 --> 06:58.209
the shocking attack on your beloved
senator has left you shaken,

06:58.293 --> 07:04.007
but Orn Free Taa's condition continues to
improve, and he will make a full recovery.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.304
But...

07:09.387 --> 07:13.308
The perpetrators of this heinous
assassination attempt have been captured.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.976
-Assassination attempt?
- Rest assured,

07:15.060 --> 07:18.146
-Cham Syndulla and his insurgents...
-That's not what happened.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.273
...will answer for their betrayal.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.610
Hunter... Crosshair's here.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.781
Great. Just what we need.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.748
The plasma bridge into the city's
been deactivated.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.501
Well, I say we fly in
and blow our way out.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.170
The Capitol scanners
would detect our ship.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.838
I don't like the look of this.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.758
The troop presence here
is similar to that of Raxus.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.010
This is a military occupation.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.346
Ryloth's not a Separatist planet.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.555
Exactly my point.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.311
Wait here.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.538
Oh, good. A probe droid.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.623
The Empire will know we're here.

08:18.707 --> 08:21.376
And so will Crosshair.
Come on. Let's move.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.629
Come on.

08:29.300 --> 08:33.138
Command received a transmission
from a probe droid in sector five.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.405
All my father wanted was peace on Ryloth.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.699
Why is this happening?

08:53.366 --> 08:56.369
He's a voice the people stand behind.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.830
That makes him a threat to the Empire.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.082
I don't care about any of that.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.876
I just want my parents back.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.258
We're all over the Imperial comm channels.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.635
They've increased patrols within the city.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.471
Crosshair will expect an attack.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.974
The element of surprise is gone.
There's nothing we can do.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.809
Wait, you can't leave.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.270
I told you no guarantees.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.065
We'll get you off world
and take you some place safe.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.149
Stop!

09:27.984 --> 09:29.611
I'll pay you double.

09:29.694 --> 09:33.823
All the money in the galaxy
won't matter if we're dead.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.869
What you're asking us to do,
it's not worth the risk.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.371
Not to you.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.710
You shouldn't have said that.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.172
Being strategic means knowing
your limitations, Omega.

09:49.839 --> 09:54.177
She's trying to save her family, Hunter.
I'd do the same for you.

10:01.810 --> 10:06.564
No, Howzer. "Some" isn't good enough.
I want all of Syndulla's supporters found.

10:07.107 --> 10:12.904
Sir, if we continue rounding up peaceful
citizens, it will incite an uprising.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.784
Then they will be arrested too.
Peace has a cost, Captain.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.163
Clone Force 99 is on Ryloth.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.793
They were spotted near the Capitol.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.255
We have a battalion of troopers
right outside.

10:30.338 --> 10:34.384
That's not enough.
I know what they're capable of.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.470
I'm more worried about
what you're capable of.

10:38.138 --> 10:43.226
Since your squad has yet to locate
Hera Syndulla, I suggest you stay on task.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.186
Or I will find someone who can.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.455
-

11:03.538 --> 11:05.457
I don't need a lecture, Chop.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.419
I didn't give up. He did.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.463
Hunter means well.

11:12.881 --> 11:16.718
I know you're scared, but don't give up.
He'll come around.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.429
Why do you trust him so much?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.473
Because he's my brother.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.850
-Brother? Him?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.311
They all are.

11:27.937 --> 11:28.938
You're lucky.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.359
You can trust them too.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.404
All we need to do is think of a plan
and convince Hunter.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.031
Why would he listen to me?

11:38.656 --> 11:40.033
Because it's strategic.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.037
Ryloth is your home.
You know it better than us.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.539
Yes, I do.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.681
So this is the side you've chosen?

12:03.264 --> 12:05.392
Look.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.562
You both attacked an Imperial convoy.
What did you think would happen?

12:09.646 --> 12:13.149
Taa gave us no choice.
We had to protect Hera.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.696
That's what I'm trying to do.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.784
Admiral Rampart's squad
is out there looking for her.

12:22.867 --> 12:23.910
She's in danger.

12:25.620 --> 12:29.791
So please, if you know where she is,
tell me.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.084
I'll protect her.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.753
Like how you swore to protect Ryloth?

12:34.337 --> 12:36.381
We trusted you, Howzer.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.259
I won't make that mistake again.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.648
Attack the Capitol? Wh-- That was my plan.

12:53.732 --> 12:57.819
Not the Capitol,
the Imperial refinery on the outskirts.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.863
I've been spying on their activity.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.364
I know their routine.

13:01.448 --> 13:05.118
If we attack there, reinforcements
will be diverted from the Capitol.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.121
We can use that distraction
to rescue Hera's parents.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.124
Any heavy defenses at the refinery?

13:11.207 --> 13:14.335
Five perimeter cannons,
but they are unmanned.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.422
Auto cannons are extremely vulnerable.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.299
Where is the control console?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.801
Right inside the main gate.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.011
It is heavily guarded,

13:23.094 --> 13:27.307
but Chopper can slip inside with
the other droids and disable the cannons.

13:30.977 --> 13:35.523
All right. You two go with Chopper
as backup, but at a distance.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.483
-Really?
-Really?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.236
By themselves?

13:40.320 --> 13:44.199
Tech, Wrecker. Wait until those cannons
are down and move in.

13:44.282 --> 13:47.744
Echo and I will scale the Capitol wall
and free Hera's parents.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.413
I guess we'll follow your lead.

13:57.629 --> 13:58.797
We are in position.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.889
Have your chain codes out
and ready for inspection.

14:19.401 --> 14:21.528
They're approaching the checkpoint.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.113
Get ready, Chop.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.283
-

14:53.768 --> 14:55.895
-

15:02.027 --> 15:05.321
What do you mean it won't work?
You said you could disable the cannons.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.786
Hey! You don't belong here!

15:13.830 --> 15:15.707
We have to help Chopper.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.798
We will, but first,
we need to take the console off-line.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.884
Uh, how are we going to do that?

15:25.967 --> 15:27.385
With one of those.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.721
You said you wanted to be a pilot, right?

15:30.972 --> 15:31.973
Yeah.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.767
Well, come on.

15:45.904 --> 15:46.905
Huh?

15:47.697 --> 15:49.199
A little help?
- Hey.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.839
My parents would never approve
of this plan.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.466
I won't tell if you won't.

16:22.691 --> 16:26.486
Omega, has Chopper deactivated
the perimeter cannons?

16:26.569 --> 16:31.491
No, but Hera and I are working on it.
Just don't shoot down our shuttle.

16:31.574 --> 16:32.951
Wait. What shuttle?

16:33.576 --> 16:34.703
Here we go.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.338
Sorry!

16:50.677 --> 16:52.512
We've got a security breach!

16:52.595 --> 16:54.514
Unauthorized launch from shuttle two!

17:13.950 --> 17:17.912
Omega, I am registering
multiple explosions near the refinery.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.540
That was us. Cannons are down.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.337
Do some damage, Wrecker.
-

17:25.420 --> 17:26.963
That, I can do!

17:29.299 --> 17:30.425
Hang on.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.719
Whoa!

17:44.022 --> 17:45.398
Call in reinforcements!

17:54.491 --> 17:55.700
The refinery is under attack.

17:55.784 --> 17:59.162
I'll handle it.
Stay here and guard the Capitol.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.302
-What are you doing here?
- Breaking you out.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.428
You know them?

18:15.512 --> 18:18.932
They are mercenaries.
But I didn't hire them for this.

18:19.015 --> 18:19.974
Hera did.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.936
Hera? Where is she? Is she safe?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.314
We're getting the hang of this.

18:28.942 --> 18:31.319
Yes, your dangerous
and uncontrolled maneuvering

18:31.403 --> 18:33.905
is as confusing to them as it is to us.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.454
Stop.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.499
The admiral said to protect the refinery.

18:44.582 --> 18:47.252
That's not their target.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.004
Then why are they attacking it?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.382
Cham, wait!

19:35.008 --> 19:36.634
You're walking into a trap.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.471
There's a squad out there waiting.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.978
Why should we trust you?

19:47.562 --> 19:49.689
Because I'm on your side.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.361
What the Empire is doing is wrong.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.615
You have to get out of here.
They have the exits blocked.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.160
We can use Senator Taa's shuttle
in his private tower hangar.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.622
I'm sorry, General.
I should've stopped this sooner.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.041
Our fight for Ryloth is not over.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.876
We will return.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.254
You can't stay here.
They'll know you helped us.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.507
I will not abandon my squad.

20:15.590 --> 20:16.591
They're good men.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.511
I have to try to get through to them.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.638
Go, while there's still time.

20:39.781 --> 20:42.325
Tech, Omega, we have alternate transport.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.660
Meet at the rendezvous.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.746
Gladly. Because there are multiple
Imperial vessels inbound.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.379
Commander, should we move in?

20:54.462 --> 20:56.256
Stay in position.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.843
This is their way out.

21:12.397 --> 21:15.817
Brothers. What are we doing?

21:15.900 --> 21:20.697
We came here to free Ryloth
from Separatist control, and we succeeded.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.282
But look around you.

21:23.116 --> 21:28.204
We're now being ordered to target
the very people we swore to protect.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.249
And I will not be a part of it any longer.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.462
Who will stand with me?

21:48.600 --> 21:50.393
Arrest those traitors.

22:38.733 --> 22:40.735
Here's the payment Hera promised.

22:41.444 --> 22:42.987
Keep it. You'll need it.

22:43.822 --> 22:47.367
These occupations are happening
on other planets besides Ryloth.

22:47.450 --> 22:53.123
I hoped to have fought my last war,
but our people need us now more than ever.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.582
We must organize.

22:54.666 --> 22:57.794
Well, that's not something
we can help with, General.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.171
I have my own people to look out for.

23:01.840 --> 23:06.302
If a war is coming,
it will be their fight as much as ours.

23:07.595 --> 23:08.638
Come along, Hera.

23:11.766 --> 23:14.269
Tech showed me how to scramble
a ship's signature.

23:14.352 --> 23:17.105
We will soon see how well it works.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.607
It is time for us to go.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.198
Well, copilot, we didn't do too bad.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.200
Do you have to go?

23:29.826 --> 23:32.912
For now, but I'm sure I'll see you around.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.832
And keep an eye on your brothers.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.001
They need it.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.586
I will.

23:41.796 --> 23:44.090
Thanks. For believing in me.

24:17.582 --> 24:21.336
It would seem
I underestimated your four friends.

24:22.337 --> 24:26.091
If only they were fighting for us
instead of against us.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.220
Request permission to hunt them down.

24:30.303 --> 24:31.304
Hmm.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.223
Granted.
