02:19.506 --> 02:21.440
Hello, dusty.
Oh, here she is.

02:21.442 --> 02:22.341
Hi.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.676
Welcome to Jefferson high.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.644
Thank you.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.313
Let me show you around.
This way.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.216
So homeroom starts
promptly at 7:30.

02:31.218 --> 02:33.886
You get two 10-minute breaks
at 11 and 1:45.

02:33.888 --> 02:35.721
And here is your locker.

02:35.723 --> 02:39.424
And this is the combination
for the lock.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.560
Nice boots.
Not.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.931
It's a friendly bunch.

02:45.933 --> 02:49.635
Just give them some time.
It's a good school.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.136
Come on.

02:51.138 --> 02:52.838
Samuel Langhorne Clemens?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.907
Well, maybe you've heard
of mark twain.

02:54.909 --> 02:57.242
I'm sure you've heard of him.
Hi, Mr. Murphy.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.444
This is our new student, dusty.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.346
Howdy, sir.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.683
Um, class?
This is dusty.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.752
Hi.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.024
All right, why don't you take
a seat in this row right here?

03:12.026 --> 03:13.392
Yeah.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.105
Yeehaw!
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

03:32.145 --> 03:33.445
Whoever said that,

03:33.447 --> 03:36.648
try to act your age
and not your IQ.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.484
Okay, back to
<i>the adventures of tom Sawyer.</i>

03:44.691 --> 03:45.991
Sugar?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.726
Sugar.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.761
Here you are, sugar.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.496
Thank you.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.632
How about a plate?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.801
In this cupboard right here.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.870
And don't worry,
you'll get the hang of it.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.138
Thank you.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.441
And thank you for letting
me and dad stay here.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.009
Are you kidding me?

04:04.011 --> 04:07.045
It's a dream come true
having you stationed here

04:07.047 --> 04:08.780
in my home base.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.349
You want some?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.851
Well, we're indebted
to you, dad. You know that.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.353
Oh, will you be quiet?

04:14.355 --> 04:16.088
We've always been there
for each other,

04:16.089 --> 04:17.755
and we always will be.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.459
Honey, are you gonna be
comfortable in that room?

04:20.461 --> 04:22.561
Oh, yeah. It's perfect.
Thank you.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.529
Now, you can decorate it
any way you want.

04:24.531 --> 04:27.966
I've got your dad's old bug
and spider collection.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.736
We can put it on the wall
if you like.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.939
I'm good.
Yeah. Thank you, though.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.974
Okay.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.980
Okay, don't take it all.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.552
Hey, incoming.

04:50.523 --> 04:54.660
Hey, cowgirl!
Where's your horse?

04:54.662 --> 04:57.029
Maybe she doesn't have a horse.

04:57.031 --> 05:00.499
Oh, she has a horse.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.846
Yes, sir.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.617
That's right, sir.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.687
My team is ready.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.927
When you give me the word,
I can travel in one hour.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.395
Yes, sir.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.965
Who was that?

05:35.134 --> 05:37.269
Lieutenant Bryant.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.271
What'd he want?

05:39.273 --> 05:41.873
Just for me to be ready.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.377
Why do both of my parents
have to be in the army?

05:47.347 --> 05:48.747
That's how we met.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.950
No army, no dusty.

05:54.654 --> 05:58.256
I was at an officers' dance
with my buddies,

05:58.258 --> 06:00.659
and I looked up
this long staircase.

06:00.661 --> 06:05.530
And there you saw the most
beautiful woman at the dance

06:05.532 --> 06:07.032
with the most beautiful legs

06:07.034 --> 06:09.301
this side
of the Mississippi river.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.103
Have I told you
this story before?

06:11.105 --> 06:12.404
Once or twice.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.607
She was beautiful,

06:15.609 --> 06:18.577
but I could tell
that she was also tough.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.012
And we just have to remember
that while she's deployed

06:21.014 --> 06:24.616
that she is one tough lady
who can take care of herself.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.152
I know that.

06:29.188 --> 06:31.556
But, dad, I just...

06:31.558 --> 06:35.460
I can't stop feeling
so helpless, you know?

06:35.462 --> 06:38.063
Like there's nothing
that I can do.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.566
Maybe there is something
you can do.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.212
Would you like to donate?
Support our troops?

06:54.214 --> 06:55.580
No, thanks.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.051
This a great idea.
Thanks so much for doing this.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.953
Thank you.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.790
You are going to be
our first donation of the day.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.391
Excellent.
Good luck.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.093
Thanks.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.930
Would you guys like
to support our troops?

07:17.069 --> 07:19.204
Um, what are you doing?

07:19.206 --> 07:23.108
Raising money to buy things
for our troops overseas.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.343
Why?

07:25.345 --> 07:27.412
Because it means a lot
to a soldier

07:27.414 --> 07:30.682
to receive a package...
Books, cookies,

07:30.684 --> 07:33.618
anything to remind them
that they aren't alone.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.855
Seems to me like
a lot of people don't even know

07:36.857 --> 07:38.590
there's a war going on
right now.

07:40.159 --> 07:41.827
Yeah.

07:41.829 --> 07:45.263
My father,
he used to be a ranger.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.798
Wait, really?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.267
My dad, he's a ranger too.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.602
Really?
Yeah, my mom,

07:50.604 --> 07:52.671
she's an army helicopter pilot.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.573
She's in Afghanistan right now.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.675
I'm dusty Rhodes.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.977
Dusty Rhodes?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.880
My parents have a very
questionable sense of humor.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.783
I like it.
I'm Savanah Stocker.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.451
I like that too.
Thanks.

08:06.453 --> 08:09.488
I... my friends
are waiting for me.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.956
Yeah.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.058
Hey.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.493
Rangers lead the way?

08:23.369 --> 08:24.469
All the way.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.605
See ya.
Bye, Savanah.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.774
We were walking
across the grass,

08:29.776 --> 08:31.409
and it was just lying there.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.812
So we picked it up
and we brought it in school,

08:33.813 --> 08:35.647
and that's when you found us.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.048
You expect me to believe

08:37.049 --> 08:38.984
this bottle doesn't
belong to you?

08:38.986 --> 08:40.818
This is the third time, Savanah,

08:40.821 --> 08:43.788
and you know suspension
is the next step.

08:44.657 --> 08:47.092
I've tried to go easy on you

08:47.094 --> 08:49.060
because of the loss
of your father.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.397
I-I just can't ignore
your behavior anymore.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.599
You are so smart and so pretty,

08:54.601 --> 08:56.468
and you're just
throwing it all away.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.836
It's mine.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.874
I asked Savanah
to hold it for me.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.911
Yours?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.981
Yes, ma'am.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.983
Yeah. Ahem.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.753
It's hers.
I was going to tell you.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.724
Well, Ms. Rhodes,
I don't know

09:19.726 --> 09:21.960
about where you come from,
but here,

09:21.962 --> 09:24.262
it is illegal
for a minor to drink alcohol,

09:24.264 --> 09:27.399
and it certainly
doesn't belong on campus.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.234
I was just...

09:29.236 --> 09:31.369
Feeling the pressure
of being new to school.

09:31.371 --> 09:35.173
And, um...
It won't happen again.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.610
Because you're new

09:38.612 --> 09:41.179
and because
your mother is overseas,

09:41.181 --> 09:45.417
I will give you
a one-time pass.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.085
Thank you.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.295
Why'd you do that?

09:58.497 --> 09:59.898
Savanah, I'm...

10:01.701 --> 10:02.981
I'm really sorry about your dad.

10:06.806 --> 10:11.142
I don't need you or anyone else
feeling sorry for me.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.310
Got it?

10:27.159 --> 10:29.661
This is not my day.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.096
You need some help?

10:31.098 --> 10:33.198
Uh... no.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.599
Yes.
Heh, heh.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.867
Thank you.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.971
You know, you didn't have to do
what you did for Savanah.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.841
Oh, yeah, no, I don't know
what I was thinking.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.677
I must have had a brain freeze.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.078
I'm Trevor.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.014
Oh, dusty.

10:49.016 --> 10:53.018
So, uh, how are you liking
Jefferson high so far?

10:53.020 --> 10:54.552
Well...

10:54.554 --> 10:58.423
It is definitely better
than being eaten by cannibals.

11:00.359 --> 11:01.693
Everything's relative, right?

11:01.695 --> 11:02.994
I reckon so.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.732
Well, um,
I will see you in class.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.167
Yes, you will.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.071
Thanks for the help.
Yeah.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.510
Guys, this report
is a big deal, okay?

11:18.512 --> 11:20.478
This is 20 percent
of your grade.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.880
I don't have...

11:21.882 --> 11:23.815
I don't know who you guys
are gonna choose yet.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.050
Do you know
who you're gonna choose?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.251
Do you know
who you're gonna choose?

11:26.253 --> 11:27.786
My pen's not working.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.387
You have two weeks left.
Here.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.623
All right? I don't even know
what's going on here.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.258
What about you?
Take it.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.126
<i>On the road</i> by Kerouac.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.895
There's many books you can do.
Thank you.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.797
All right? Just choose one.

11:46.205 --> 11:49.407
Oh, hey, dusty Rhodes,
why don't you sit with us?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.975
Thanks.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.211
Guys, this is dusty Rhodes.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.014
Meryl, Cinda, Dale,
and that's Trevor.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.249
Hello again.
Hi.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.018
Like your costume.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.753
I like your costume.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.822
It's not a costume.
It's my... it's my shirt.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.890
Mine too.
Don't mind Dale.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.093
His mom dropped him on his head
when he was a baby.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.162
Multiple times.
It's not funny.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.530
Okay.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.233
Look, we're all pretty nice
once you get to know us.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.502
Not that that's going to happen.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.370
Wouldn't expect it to.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.072
Why are you here?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.374
Savanah just invited me
to sit here.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.411
No. Like, why are you here
at Jefferson high?

12:26.413 --> 12:28.880
My father was reassigned.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.416
Well, a little advice?
Please.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.284
If you want to fit in
around here,

12:33.286 --> 12:37.522
you might want to lose
the whole... Cowgirl thing.

12:37.524 --> 12:40.558
Oh. Well, thank you
for that advice, Meryl,

12:40.560 --> 12:42.594
but, you see,
I actually like the way I am.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.829
And I definitely don't want
to fit in if fitting in

12:44.831 --> 12:47.232
means being a sniveling,
insecure sheep, so...

12:47.234 --> 12:50.635
Baa! Would you like
some ice with that burn?

12:50.637 --> 12:53.138
I like him.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.806
I guess I'll take this to go.

12:54.808 --> 12:55.874
Thank you.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.542
Later, cowgirl.
Trevor.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.814
Is she saying that I'm
a sniveling, insecure sheep?

13:02.816 --> 13:04.582
No. No, really...

13:04.584 --> 13:06.251
Yeah, I didn't get that.
At all.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.956
Okay.
Okay.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.859
Spill the secret.
Is there any city Wi-Fi?

13:14.861 --> 13:16.394
No, no, no.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.763
Around here, we still do it
the old-fashioned way.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.665
Our communication?

13:20.667 --> 13:23.101
Face-to-face.
Goody.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.971
You still worried
about your mom?

13:28.808 --> 13:31.009
I always am.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.844
Honey, she's gonna be okay.

13:32.846 --> 13:36.514
God is watching over Helen.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.917
How can you be so sure?

13:38.919 --> 13:42.320
That god is watching over her?

13:42.322 --> 13:45.023
I believe it in my heart.
He is.

13:46.025 --> 13:48.259
Is there any actual proof?

13:49.595 --> 13:51.796
Well, sometimes, dusty,

13:51.798 --> 13:53.698
the only thing
that can lift us up,

13:53.700 --> 13:57.869
the only thing that can see us
through those difficult times,

13:57.871 --> 14:01.739
is the simple act
of having faith.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.175
See, faith comes from the heart,
not just from the mind.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.846
It's not mathematical.
It's not rational.

14:07.848 --> 14:11.182
You just feel it.
You know it.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.419
And the most important thing
about faith

14:14.421 --> 14:16.988
is it's all or nothing.

14:16.990 --> 14:20.892
You can't do faith halfway.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.797
Mmm, I knew you were gonna
say something like that.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.666
Well, you asked.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.268
Let's go.
Okay.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.005
Thanks, Gramps.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.380
Hey.
Hey, cowgirl.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.183
What are you gonna sign up for?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.151
Honestly?

14:47.153 --> 14:49.454
I'm not too excited
about any of them.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.523
Yeah, me neither.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.899
Equestrian drill team?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.233
Yes, ma'am.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.002
What exactly is that?

15:04.004 --> 15:06.037
It's a horse riding team.

15:06.039 --> 15:08.006
We do drills, perform at rodeos,

15:08.008 --> 15:09.641
football games, stuff like that.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.879
Well, I don't exactly see
a groundswell of demand

15:14.881 --> 15:16.014
for such a group.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.649
Do you?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.386
Before there was Starbucks,

15:21.388 --> 15:23.354
we didn't know
that we needed it, right?

15:25.024 --> 15:26.591
Mrs. Preston,
as you know,

15:26.593 --> 15:29.727
I am having a very tough time
right now.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.796
With my mom being deployed
in a combat war zone,

15:31.798 --> 15:34.666
I am just looking for something
to keep me occupied.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.603
How many girls to a team?

15:38.605 --> 15:41.039
A minimum of eight.

15:41.041 --> 15:43.207
Well, if you can get
eight girls to sign up,

15:43.209 --> 15:44.976
you can have your team.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.244
Yes!

15:46.246 --> 15:47.645
But there are
no school funds left.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.247
So whatever the costs
for this team,

15:49.249 --> 15:50.715
you'll have to cover
on your own.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.950
Absolutely, of course.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.451
That is exactly
what sponsors are for.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.586
I promise
you will not regret this.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.728
Hmm.

16:11.070 --> 16:14.706
Hi. Would y'all like to sign up
for the equestrian drill team?

16:14.708 --> 16:16.140
Um, no.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.375
Like, giddyup.

16:17.377 --> 16:20.278
Yippie Yi-yo ki-yay,
whatever.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.886
Hi. Would you like to sign up
for the equestrian drill team?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.922
No, thanks.

16:30.924 --> 16:32.623
Do you ride?

16:32.625 --> 16:34.092
Yeah, a little.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.561
Well, then this would be
perfect for you.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.662
No, thanks.

16:42.601 --> 16:43.601
Hey.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.269
Hey.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.305
What's an equestrian drill team?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.575
Oh, it's doing maneuvers
on horseback.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.343
Well, I'd kill myself.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.713
Why are you making that face?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.715
Are you trying to guilt me
into joining?

16:57.717 --> 16:58.950
No.

16:58.952 --> 17:00.351
Yeah, you think
I owe you just 'cause

17:00.353 --> 17:02.020
you took the blame for me
the other day.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.756
I would never do that.
Mm.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.260
Look, cowgirl, I do owe you,

17:09.262 --> 17:10.862
but I'm not getting on no horse.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.329
No way.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.965
Don't sign up
for anything else yet, okay?

17:14.968 --> 17:16.800
So you can at least
think about it.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.536
Fine.

17:21.106 --> 17:25.042
Not every girl grows up
loving horses, dusty.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.414
Yeah, some girls like pigs.

17:32.351 --> 17:34.719
Thank you for that.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.654
That was fun, wasn't it?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.056
I'm gonna be honest.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.991
I think we ought to cut you down
on the cookies.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.125
You're a little bit bigger.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.660
It's the truth.

17:44.630 --> 17:47.398
You know what I don't
understand?

17:47.400 --> 17:50.268
Those kids.
They don't get it.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.571
I don't think they understand
how much fun it would be.

17:55.307 --> 17:57.742
If only they could see
you and me in action.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.348
That's it.

18:05.551 --> 18:09.087
You are a genius!

18:09.089 --> 18:10.588
Yes, you are.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.626
She's always holding
her glasses,

18:15.628 --> 18:17.128
like just get
a pair of contacts.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.163
Look at that.

18:35.581 --> 18:38.683
You can't bring
a horse on campus.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.319
This is star.
He's me promotional tool.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.588
The basketball team
has a basketball hoop,

18:43.590 --> 18:46.157
so we figured
why not have a horse

18:46.159 --> 18:47.658
for the equestrian drill team?

18:47.660 --> 18:51.028
There is no
equestrian drill team.

18:51.030 --> 18:54.132
Sign-ups are over
in an hour, dusty.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.100
And so far,

18:56.102 --> 18:58.569
you're the only name
on the list.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.638
And me.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.374
I'd like to sign up
for the team.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.910
I'd like to sign up too.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.679
I mean, if it's okay
for someone like me to join.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.047
Of course.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.716
My dad is in the army too.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.819
I mean, I don't know
a ton about horses,

19:14.821 --> 19:16.888
but I could learn.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.290
I'll do it!
Me too.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.325
Sure, sounds fun.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.027
We want to join the team!

19:23.029 --> 19:24.195
Giddyup!

19:24.197 --> 19:26.998
Well, good luck.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.566
You're gonna need it.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.602
We have a team!

19:31.604 --> 19:33.070
Here, guys, come meet star.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.415
You each have
your own horse now,

19:44.417 --> 19:46.784
courtesy of our
first official sponsor,

19:46.786 --> 19:49.487
Mr. Sage carver
of the carver stables.

19:49.489 --> 19:52.890
Hello, girls.
And, gentlemen.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.525
Here is Jason carver.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.495
He's his son and will be
helping us out.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.596
Howdy.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.166
This is my horse, star.

20:02.168 --> 20:03.935
He knows me better
than any person

20:03.937 --> 20:05.236
in the entire the world.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.438
Now, remember,
a horse is pure of heart,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.740
so you gotta be the same...
No agendas, no games.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.576
Respect your horse,
look after your horse,

20:11.578 --> 20:14.712
and he or she
will literally die for you.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.115
Okay, ladies,
first things first.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.117
Let's get up beside our horses,

20:20.119 --> 20:22.286
put your reins in your hand,

20:22.288 --> 20:24.055
put your foot in your stirrup,

20:24.057 --> 20:25.923
and pull yourself straight up.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.661
Just like that.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.731
Just put it right there.

20:44.343 --> 20:45.843
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.246
There's something wrong
with my horse.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.615
The only thing wrong
with that horse is you.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.184
Big pull. You ready?

20:53.186 --> 20:54.685
One, two, three, pull!

20:54.687 --> 20:56.320
Come on.
You got it.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.989
Oh, big pull.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.758
I'm good.
All right.

21:02.828 --> 21:05.062
Looking good, Savanah.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.597
Thanks, miss dusty.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.432
So are we even now, cowgirl?

21:08.434 --> 21:09.767
Oh, I reckon so.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.701
But let's be real...

21:10.703 --> 21:14.038
Do friends really need
to keep track?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.574
I reckon not.
Heh-heh-heh.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.876
I think I'm gonna have
a sore butt tomorrow.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.845
Oh, you are most definitely

21:20.847 --> 21:23.014
going to have
a sore butt tomorrow.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.715
Yay.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.065
This is why you're
the pooper scooper

22:14.067 --> 22:15.466
and I'm the rider.

22:15.468 --> 22:16.801
Are these
for that throwing game?

22:16.803 --> 22:18.669
It's a shoe for the horse.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.138
Horses wear shoes?
They do.

22:45.965 --> 22:46.997
Baa!

22:46.999 --> 22:50.067
Dusty, I know you did this.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.402
You better watch your back,

22:51.404 --> 22:53.838
because one good prank
deserves another.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.375
Okay, okay.
I've been warned.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.876
Nicely played, Dale.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.778
Baa!

23:04.249 --> 23:05.916
So, I did some research,

23:05.918 --> 23:09.587
and I think that this place
might want to sponsor us.

23:11.923 --> 23:14.091
I'm not going in there.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.093
Why not?
I'm not.

23:16.095 --> 23:19.397
Savanah, you're going.
It's good for the team, okay?

23:28.306 --> 23:30.007
Hello, Savanah.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.675
Hi, Mr. Janson.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.210
You two know each other?

23:33.212 --> 23:36.447
Yeah, Mr. Janson and my father
used to be business partners.

23:38.216 --> 23:41.585
Oh.
Uh, well, I am dusty.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.687
Mr. Janson.
Pleasure to meet you.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.723
How's your mom, Savanah?

23:45.725 --> 23:47.792
She's... she's really well.
Ahem.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.661
Has a job, high-paying.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.763
Give her my best, will you?

23:52.765 --> 23:54.932
I will.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.436
So, what can I do
for you girls today?

23:58.438 --> 23:59.904
Uh, Savanah and I have started

23:59.906 --> 24:02.873
our very own equestrian
drill team at a high school,

24:02.875 --> 24:04.975
and we're looking for a sponsor

24:04.977 --> 24:07.611
who will help pay
for the feed for our horses.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.614
What does something
like that cost?

24:10.616 --> 24:14.385
Not as much
as you'd think, actually.

24:14.387 --> 24:16.687
Plus, it can be
a tax write-off for you.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.590
And we would happy to help
promote your store

24:19.592 --> 24:21.759
in any way that...

24:23.261 --> 24:24.995
Any way that we can.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.600
A thousand dollars!

24:29.602 --> 24:31.469
That was too easy.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.337
We are not cashing that check.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.705
Why not?

24:36.508 --> 24:37.908
He gave you that check
out of guilt

24:37.910 --> 24:39.577
because of what he's done
to my family.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.278
What has he done to your family?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.047
He stole from us.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.648
How?

24:44.650 --> 24:46.150
After my dad died,

24:46.152 --> 24:48.419
we couldn't find
an old baseball card he owned.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.020
I know he left it
with Mr. Janson,

24:50.022 --> 24:51.422
but he denies he ever had it.

24:51.424 --> 24:53.190
A baseball card?

24:53.192 --> 24:54.592
It's valuable.
Come on.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.727
A 1914 babe Ruth.

24:58.797 --> 25:01.799
Look, I don't... I don't know
what you want me to say.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.268
We really need this money, okay?

25:04.270 --> 25:06.904
It's gonna make
all the difference to the team.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.106
You do what you have to do.

25:09.108 --> 25:10.941
I have my own ways
of getting even.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.711
What does that mean?

25:21.953 --> 25:23.587
You need to give that back
right now.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.756
No way! He owes my mom and I
a hundred laptops.

25:25.758 --> 25:27.958
I don't care
if he owes you 500 laptops.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.426
That is wrong.

25:29.428 --> 25:31.495
You're no fun, dusty.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.230
Has anyone ever told you that?

25:37.469 --> 25:39.703
They have now.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.157
You can't beat the Apache.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.626
It's the weapon of choice,
in my opinion.

26:05.731 --> 26:08.098
Oh, my god.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.867
Dude, I fully agree
with you on that.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.902
That's insane.
That's what I mean.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.837
You don't see anything
like it out there.

26:13.839 --> 26:17.241
Do you guys have
anything better to do?

26:17.243 --> 26:21.879
Nothing better
than watching the enemy die.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.048
Oh, dude, look.
Dude, look.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.620
What's wrong?

26:29.622 --> 26:31.088
Oh, nothing.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.158
I, um... I'm fine.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.627
Really?

26:36.629 --> 26:38.596
I was in the cafeteria,
and these guys

26:38.598 --> 26:40.631
were watching war footage

26:40.633 --> 26:42.132
like it was some sort
of video game.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.969
It just freaked me out,
that's all.

26:46.738 --> 26:49.206
Do you want to go
on a hike this afternoon?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.674
Yeah.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.911
Uh, wait, but Savanah...
She won't mind?

26:53.913 --> 26:56.513
Oh, no, she's taking
her mom to the doctor.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.916
Great.
Come on.

27:21.206 --> 27:22.840
It's beautiful.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.608
This is where my brothers
and I would come

27:24.610 --> 27:26.176
when we needed to escape.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.747
Why did you need to escape?

27:31.016 --> 27:33.584
Uh, well, before my parents
got a divorce,

27:33.586 --> 27:37.054
they had some...
Pretty good fights.

27:39.592 --> 27:42.626
It was either stay
and play referee,

27:42.628 --> 27:47.264
which never worked,
or run for the hills.

27:48.266 --> 27:49.800
Literally.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.940
I'm sorry.

27:56.942 --> 27:59.443
I didn't get much sleep
last night.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.844
Why not?

28:01.780 --> 28:05.716
I keep having this dream.

28:07.452 --> 28:08.719
What about?

28:10.288 --> 28:12.289
Nothing, it's stupid.

28:14.426 --> 28:19.730
You know that you could
tell me if you wanted to.

28:21.399 --> 28:23.634
Um...

28:23.636 --> 28:26.136
I dream about my mom.

28:27.505 --> 28:28.972
She's flying her helicopter,

28:28.974 --> 28:32.943
and I'm on the ground
waiting for her to pick me up.

28:32.945 --> 28:36.413
She lowers the rope,
and it swings all around me,

28:36.415 --> 28:39.149
but I can't catch it.

28:39.151 --> 28:43.554
She yells, "grab the rope,
dusty, grab the rope!"

28:43.556 --> 28:46.223
But I can't.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.125
All this time,
the wind from the rotors

28:48.127 --> 28:52.162
are blowing me over,
and I can barely stand up.

28:54.466 --> 28:58.202
Finally, she has to leave
because the enemy's closing in.

29:00.138 --> 29:04.608
I watch as she flies
higher and higher

29:04.610 --> 29:06.443
until she disappears.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.915
The soldiers start
to close in on me,

29:11.917 --> 29:14.885
and before they can
reach me, I wake up.

29:16.654 --> 29:18.388
Told you it was stupid.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.290
No.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.893
Is Savanah okay
that we hang out?

29:22.895 --> 29:24.962
Yeah.
Why wouldn't it be?

29:24.964 --> 29:27.464
Uh, because
she's your girlfriend?

29:28.833 --> 29:30.968
Yeah, uh, people think
that we're a couple

29:30.970 --> 29:33.003
because we're together
all the time,

29:33.005 --> 29:37.808
but I've just known her
for, like, ever.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.176
We're actually related.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.612
Oh.
Yeah, third cousins.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.280
Of course.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.817
That is good to know.

29:48.386 --> 29:49.653
Yeah.

30:09.073 --> 30:10.808
What are you doing?

30:14.779 --> 30:16.213
No.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.316
I told my dad
we wouldn't be welcome here.

30:20.618 --> 30:24.888
That...
That is not true, okay?

30:25.690 --> 30:27.491
Look, whoever did this

30:27.493 --> 30:31.295
is narrow-minded
and stupid, and...

30:32.764 --> 30:35.866
And I think I might know
who did it.

30:35.868 --> 30:37.935
It blew up the entire compound.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.070
It's insane.
No, it was so...

30:40.072 --> 30:43.340
I've never seen anything like it.
Ha, ha! Hey.

30:43.342 --> 30:47.878
So some jerk spray-painted
the side of my friend's car.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.146
Oh.
Yeah.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.848
That sucks.
So?

30:57.622 --> 30:58.989
Oh.

31:01.060 --> 31:04.061
Go spread your hatred
somewhere else.

31:06.097 --> 31:07.631
Are you just
gonna let her take it?

31:07.633 --> 31:08.899
It was empty anyways.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.835
No, it wasn't.
Yes... yes... yes, it was.

31:12.838 --> 31:15.005
Hey, Trevor.
Hi.

31:15.007 --> 31:16.840
Have you seen Savanah?

31:16.842 --> 31:18.909
No, she didn't come
to school today.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.011
We should go see her.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.881
She doesn't really
like visitors.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.349
Do I care?

31:26.351 --> 31:28.085
Come on.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.987
We should call Jason.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.304
Hey.

31:47.306 --> 31:50.173
You didn't come to school today.

31:50.175 --> 31:53.577
Uh, just dealing with things.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.380
Is everything okay?

31:56.382 --> 32:00.851
Savanah, who is it?

32:00.853 --> 32:03.754
Just some friends from school.

32:03.756 --> 32:06.223
- Well, bring 'em in!
- I want to meet 'em!

32:07.759 --> 32:10.227
They don't want to come in.

32:10.229 --> 32:12.362
Bring them in!

32:24.276 --> 32:26.043
What's with all the boxes?

32:26.045 --> 32:27.711
We're moving.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.290
You know, Savanah never
brings her friends around

32:40.292 --> 32:42.626
'cause she's embarrassed by me.

32:43.895 --> 32:46.063
That's not true, mom.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.665
This is dusty and Jason.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.834
Hi.
Howdy, ma'am.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.803
"Howdy, ma'am"?

32:52.805 --> 32:54.438
Oh, you must be the ones

32:54.440 --> 32:57.274
who put Savanah up
to this horse nonsense.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.677
Yeah, well, Savanah needs a job,

33:00.679 --> 33:02.446
not some horse club.

33:03.414 --> 33:06.783
She's really good on a horse.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.719
And, uh...

33:08.721 --> 33:12.022
Maybe you could come
and watch her sometime.

33:13.591 --> 33:15.926
That's never gonna happen.

33:15.928 --> 33:17.661
She really likes it.

33:18.930 --> 33:21.598
Just at my family ranch.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.968
Oh. How much does it pay?

33:24.970 --> 33:26.470
It doesn't pay, but it's fun.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.605
Uh, I'm sure they will also...

33:30.142 --> 33:31.908
Oh, you're going to college.

33:31.910 --> 33:35.412
I didn't realize you could get
into college with your grades.

33:47.392 --> 33:49.593
I don't know how you Ace
every test.

33:49.595 --> 33:52.295
You know I'm actually related
to Albert Einstein?

33:52.297 --> 33:55.665
OMG, really?
Uh, no.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.203
Hey!

34:01.205 --> 34:03.073
Hey, dusty.

34:04.642 --> 34:06.676
Hey!
Hey.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.878
Where are you going?

34:07.880 --> 34:09.545
Where do you think, Einstein?

34:10.848 --> 34:13.350
You saw me talking to that girl.

34:13.351 --> 34:16.386
You seem totally into her.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.522
I'm not totally into her.

34:18.524 --> 34:22.292
If you want to know,
she asked me to the dance.

34:23.094 --> 34:24.761
How nice for you.

34:26.964 --> 34:29.866
Dusty, dusty.
Yeah.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.601
I said no.

34:31.603 --> 34:32.835
Oh.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.737
That I wanted to go
with somebody else.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.576
If you're talking about me...

34:39.578 --> 34:41.378
I am.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.081
Okay, well,
I don't do dances, so.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.119
Dusty...

34:49.121 --> 34:51.721
Will you go
to the dance with me?

34:54.292 --> 34:56.159
I'll have to think about it.

34:59.931 --> 35:00.997
Okay.

35:11.977 --> 35:13.977
Why are you so happy?

35:13.979 --> 35:16.913
Well, if you must know,

35:16.915 --> 35:20.717
Trevor asked me
to the dance next weekend.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.221
Wait, are you okay with that?

35:24.223 --> 35:26.690
I don't care.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.860
It makes me happy
you guys are going.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.027
Me too.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.798
Are you going?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.600
No one's asked me.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.302
Anyway, I don't really
have the money.

35:41.839 --> 35:43.907
Hey, Jason.
Yeah.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.710
Savanah needs someone to take
her to the dance next weekend.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.079
Dusty!
What?

35:49.081 --> 35:51.014
I'll take Savanah to the dance.

35:51.016 --> 35:54.084
I mean, if you need
someone to go with.

35:54.086 --> 35:56.086
She does.
And she'll go.

35:56.088 --> 35:59.523
Yep, it is a done deal.
Next.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.358
I didn't put her up
to this, Jason.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.425
You don't have to take me.

36:02.427 --> 36:04.528
No, i... I want to.

36:05.530 --> 36:07.130
Okay.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.565
Okay.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.434
M'Kay!

36:11.436 --> 36:14.171
All right, uh, yeah, bye.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.639
Bye.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.974
I am like your fairy godmother.

36:17.976 --> 36:19.543
No one asked you to be.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.748
I don't know how I'm going
to pay for a dress.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.818
Don't worry.

36:28.820 --> 36:32.556
We are going to find you
the perfect dress.

37:03.454 --> 37:05.655
Oh...

37:12.763 --> 37:14.197
It's mom.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.233
<i>Hello?</i>

37:16.235 --> 37:17.834
Hi, mom.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.403
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

37:20.405 --> 37:23.573
Man, it's so good to see you.
I miss you so much.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.109
<i>I miss you too.
How is everything?</i>

37:26.111 --> 37:29.312
Kind of crazy, actually.

37:29.314 --> 37:31.047
My drill team's having
its first performance

37:31.049 --> 37:34.351
this weekend down in Dalton,
and then, later that night,

37:34.353 --> 37:36.686
I am going to
the Sadie Hawkins dance.

37:36.688 --> 37:39.789
<i>You are going to a dance?</i>

37:40.959 --> 37:43.827
<i>Gosh, that kid
must be one special boy.</i>

37:43.829 --> 37:46.029
He is just a friend.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.398
<i>Well, I know you're gonna
be a huge hit</i>

37:48.400 --> 37:50.267
<i>at the rodeo and the dance.</i>

37:50.269 --> 37:52.602
I wish you could be here.

37:52.604 --> 37:53.970
<i>I wish I could too, baby.</i>

37:53.972 --> 37:56.306
<i>But I'm there with you
in spirit.</i>

37:56.308 --> 37:59.576
Uh, hey, here, talk to dad.

38:01.178 --> 38:03.213
How's my girl?

38:03.215 --> 38:04.814
Everything okay?
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

38:04.816 --> 38:06.783
<i>You know you don't have
to worry about me.</i>

38:06.785 --> 38:08.585
I can't help it.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.053
What are you doing?

38:10.055 --> 38:12.555
<i>You know, just the usual,
shuttling...</i>

38:14.159 --> 38:15.825
Helen?

38:15.827 --> 38:16.960
Mom?

38:16.962 --> 38:19.262
Helen?
Mama?

38:28.239 --> 38:30.874
She sounded good.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.142
She did.

38:48.859 --> 38:50.327
Welcome, girls.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.829
Hi, we are the rangers

38:52.831 --> 38:55.699
and we're performing today.
Oh, welcome.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.535
It's so nice to have a team here
from Jefferson high school.

38:58.537 --> 39:01.004
Oh, here's a form
you might want to fill out.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.639
Yeah.
I'll do it.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.608
Savanah?

39:06.410 --> 39:07.944
It's Mrs. Harkins.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.513
From the Johnson county
juvenile center.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.881
Don't you remember?

39:11.883 --> 39:14.451
We used to talk all the time
about your future.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.456
Yeah, I-i remember.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.458
But I didn't know you ride.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.761
I didn't know I did either
until a month ago

39:24.763 --> 39:26.696
when this crazy girl
made me do it.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.932
Well, I'm proud of you.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.000
You talked all the time
about the great things

39:31.002 --> 39:33.837
you were gonna do with
your future when you got out.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.238
Thank you.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.573
Excuse me.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.583
Hey.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.219
I should've told you
I was in that place.

39:49.221 --> 39:52.655
What were you in for?
Wait, no, let me guess.

39:52.657 --> 39:55.458
Um, could it have been
for stealing?

39:55.460 --> 39:56.893
Look...

39:58.195 --> 40:00.764
I made some mistakes,

40:00.766 --> 40:04.067
but I've paid
for those mistakes.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.902
What did you do?

40:10.442 --> 40:12.675
I broke into
Mr. Janson's house.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.545
Twice.

40:17.014 --> 40:19.482
Anything... anything else
I should know?

40:21.786 --> 40:23.686
Just...

40:23.688 --> 40:26.856
I really treasure you
as a friend, dusty.

40:28.692 --> 40:31.528
And I'm trying to get
my life together.

40:34.198 --> 40:37.133
But when you lose a parent...

40:37.135 --> 40:40.403
You lose yourself and...

40:40.405 --> 40:43.306
It's like you shatter
into a million pieces

40:43.308 --> 40:45.975
and they get scattered
in the wind.

40:47.378 --> 40:50.013
I don't know how to feel normal.

40:52.416 --> 40:55.051
I am trying, though.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.487
Every day I try.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.123
I'm sorry.

41:01.625 --> 41:04.394
Let's go ride, okay?

41:04.396 --> 41:05.595
Okay.

41:11.402 --> 41:12.936
All right, you girls,
are you ready?

41:12.938 --> 41:14.804
Yeah.
I can't hear you!

41:14.806 --> 41:16.940
Yeah!
Are you ready?

41:16.942 --> 41:18.241
Yeah!
Whoo!

41:18.243 --> 41:19.676
Rangers lead the way!

41:19.678 --> 41:21.277
All the way!

41:21.279 --> 41:22.879
Come on!

42:00.217 --> 42:03.253
Hey! To the rangers!
Long may they ride!

42:03.255 --> 42:06.422
I am so proud of you guys.
That was a great performance.

42:06.424 --> 42:08.558
It was!

42:08.560 --> 42:10.860
Is there a cowgirl here
named dusty?

42:10.862 --> 42:12.529
There she is.
No.

42:12.531 --> 42:14.163
Well, dusty, do you know
a little dance

42:14.165 --> 42:16.533
called the cowgirl stomp?
I'm afraid that I do not.

42:16.535 --> 42:19.502
She started an equestrian
drill team,

42:19.504 --> 42:22.472
but she can't do
the cowgirl stomp!

42:22.474 --> 42:23.740
Well, you know what this means?

42:23.742 --> 42:25.775
I don't.
Follow me.

42:25.777 --> 42:27.343
Oh, no, I'm good.
Come on, come on.

42:27.345 --> 42:29.512
Really, I don't dance.
Go! Go!

42:29.514 --> 42:31.748
I don't dance!
I don't dance!

42:31.750 --> 42:33.950
Was this you?
I got you, cowgirl!

42:33.952 --> 42:35.885
All right,
the cowgirl stomp is easy!

42:35.887 --> 42:37.587
Oh, no.
It goes like this.

42:37.589 --> 42:39.322
Two steps to the left.
Okay.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.890
Two steps to the right.
Yeah.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.059
A shimmy and a kick.
Okay.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.761
And a Kung-fu fight.

42:44.763 --> 42:47.730
Now clap your hands
with a whomp-whomp-whomp.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.800
Put her in the barn
with a stomp-stomp-stomp.

42:50.802 --> 42:52.035
You got that, dusty?

42:52.037 --> 42:54.137
I think so.
You guys wanna try it?

42:54.139 --> 42:56.940
Yeah!
Okay.

42:56.942 --> 43:00.577
Two steps to the left.
Two steps to the right.

43:00.579 --> 43:03.279
A shimmy and a kick
and a Kung-fu fight.

43:03.281 --> 43:05.748
Clap your hands
with a whomp-whomp-whomp.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.585
Put 'em in the barn
with a stomp-stomp-stomp.

43:08.587 --> 43:11.487
Heck, you're a lot smarter
than you look.

43:11.489 --> 43:13.790
Mwah! Well, thank you.
Let's go!

43:13.792 --> 43:16.092
Listen up, everybody.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.629
We're gonna do a little thing
called the cowgirl stomp.

43:19.631 --> 43:21.431
It goes like this.

43:34.479 --> 43:36.579
Whoo!
Come on, y'all.

44:06.911 --> 44:09.012
Whoo!

44:21.660 --> 44:24.227
Whoo!

44:56.260 --> 44:57.960
The cowboy stomp.

44:57.962 --> 44:59.729
Girl. It's actually
the cowgirl stomp.

44:59.731 --> 45:01.731
Oh. My bad.

45:01.733 --> 45:03.599
Why does it get so cold here?

45:03.601 --> 45:05.568
Here.

45:05.570 --> 45:06.736
Really?

45:06.738 --> 45:08.538
Yeah, take it.

45:08.540 --> 45:10.573
Thanks.

45:10.575 --> 45:11.974
You know, i...

45:11.976 --> 45:14.877
I keep waiting for you
to turn into a psychopath.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.046
But I'm serious.

45:17.048 --> 45:19.048
If we're going to be
hanging out with each other,

45:19.050 --> 45:20.850
there should be
no secrets between us.

45:20.852 --> 45:22.952
Okay.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.123
Cats or dogs?

45:27.125 --> 45:30.126
It's a real question.
Yeah, um...

45:30.128 --> 45:31.627
Dogs.

45:31.629 --> 45:33.062
Okay.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.298
No, come on, if you get
to ask me something,

45:35.300 --> 45:38.367
I should be able to ask you
something, all right?

45:38.369 --> 45:40.470
If you want.

45:40.472 --> 45:43.639
Okay, let's think.
Um...

45:43.641 --> 45:45.708
Zombies or vampires?

45:45.710 --> 45:47.677
Zombies.

45:47.679 --> 45:48.711
Summer or winter?

45:48.713 --> 45:50.313
Winter.

45:50.315 --> 45:51.814
Uh...

45:51.816 --> 45:53.349
Day or night?

45:55.085 --> 45:56.319
Night.

45:57.888 --> 46:00.623
Favorite superhero power?

46:00.625 --> 46:02.125
Flying.

46:02.127 --> 46:05.194
Although being invisible
would be pretty sick too.

46:05.196 --> 46:07.230
Mine's flying too.

46:19.576 --> 46:20.877
Uh...

46:21.812 --> 46:23.312
It's my dad.

46:24.848 --> 46:27.784
Let me get this.
Yeah, go ahead.

46:27.786 --> 46:29.786
Hi, dad.

46:33.857 --> 46:36.292
What? Now?

46:38.228 --> 46:40.496
Yeah, no, no, we're...
We're coming home.

46:51.308 --> 46:52.375
Why tonight?

46:52.377 --> 46:53.876
We've talked about this
a million times.

46:53.878 --> 46:55.111
I know that, I just don't get

46:55.113 --> 46:57.313
why both of my parents
have to go.

46:59.883 --> 47:01.050
I have to do my duty,

47:01.052 --> 47:03.085
which is to fight
for our country.

47:03.087 --> 47:04.720
And you have to do your duty,

47:04.722 --> 47:07.223
which is to be brave
and go to school

47:07.225 --> 47:09.058
and take care of things
here at home.

47:09.060 --> 47:12.261
Can you do that
for your mother and me?

47:12.263 --> 47:13.329
Yes.
Hooah!

47:13.331 --> 47:15.398
Plane takes off in 45 minutes.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.432
Dad...

47:16.434 --> 47:18.334
Grandpa'll take
good care of you.

47:22.406 --> 47:25.575
Guys, can you gather round here
just one more minute?

47:25.577 --> 47:26.976
One more minute.

47:28.245 --> 47:30.379
Father, your word says

47:30.381 --> 47:33.149
you'll never leave
or forsake us.

47:34.318 --> 47:36.018
And we're claiming
your word tonight

47:36.020 --> 47:38.888
because we love
and trust in you.

47:38.890 --> 47:40.756
Please watch over
Randall and Mike

47:40.758 --> 47:43.092
when they're in harm's way

47:43.094 --> 47:45.995
and deliver them back
to us safely.

47:45.997 --> 47:47.363
We pray and believe for this

47:47.365 --> 47:49.498
in the name
of our lord and savior.

47:49.500 --> 47:50.533
Amen.

47:53.470 --> 47:55.404
I love you, dusty.

47:55.406 --> 47:57.940
I'll be home before you know it.

48:00.510 --> 48:02.011
Dad.

48:07.751 --> 48:09.952
Be safe, okay?

48:17.828 --> 48:19.562
Take care of my girl, dad.

48:37.648 --> 48:39.181
Hey!

48:40.083 --> 48:42.218
So this is it.

48:43.654 --> 48:46.222
I know.
It's a dump.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.192
Why do you even have to move?

48:51.495 --> 48:54.864
Because we were evicted
out of our house.

48:54.866 --> 48:56.432
Couldn't make the payments.

48:57.634 --> 48:59.702
Wait, isn't the government
supposed to help

48:59.704 --> 49:01.170
when a soldier dies?

49:01.172 --> 49:03.139
I mean, we got some money,

49:03.141 --> 49:06.475
but it ran out a long time ago.

49:10.381 --> 49:13.249
Middle class to white trash
in three years.

49:14.918 --> 49:16.552
That's not true.

49:19.323 --> 49:21.057
Okay...

49:21.059 --> 49:24.026
So this is my room.

49:24.028 --> 49:26.329
Huh.
I think I'm gonna cry.

49:26.331 --> 49:29.699
No, no, no, it is not that bad.

49:29.701 --> 49:30.733
Really.
I mean, look.

49:30.735 --> 49:32.702
We put a throw rug right here

49:32.704 --> 49:34.170
and we paint the walls,

49:34.172 --> 49:37.373
and you've got
a pretty cozy room.

49:38.408 --> 49:40.176
You guys will really
help me paint?

49:40.178 --> 49:41.610
Of course we will.

49:41.612 --> 49:45.481
If we can paint a horse,
we can paint a room.

49:45.483 --> 49:48.284
I don't know what I'd do
without you guys.

49:48.286 --> 49:50.586
Well, it's a good thing
you'll never have to find out.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.505
Thank you so much
for all of your support

50:09.507 --> 50:10.406
towards the team.

50:10.408 --> 50:11.907
We really do appreciate it.

50:11.909 --> 50:15.811
My pleasure.
It's a tax write-off.

50:15.813 --> 50:18.180
Um... just one more thing.

50:18.182 --> 50:19.715
And I hope you don't
mind me asking,

50:19.717 --> 50:22.518
but there seems to be
a misunderstanding

50:22.520 --> 50:24.487
between Savanah
and her mom and you.

50:25.622 --> 50:27.390
Really?

50:27.392 --> 50:29.392
What kind of misunderstanding?

50:29.394 --> 50:33.696
Savanah believes that you have
withheld something from them

50:33.698 --> 50:37.600
after the death of her father,
lieutenant Stocker.

50:37.602 --> 50:39.702
She's wrong.

50:42.572 --> 50:45.408
This war...

50:45.410 --> 50:49.278
Has hit a lot of families
very hard, Mr. Janson.

50:50.647 --> 50:54.050
But it has hit the Stockers
especially cruelly.

50:55.218 --> 50:58.087
I thought her mother
had some high-paying job.

50:59.723 --> 51:02.091
Her mother has no money.

51:03.193 --> 51:05.294
She has no job.

51:06.430 --> 51:08.097
They were just kicked
out of their home

51:08.099 --> 51:10.566
that's been in their family
for 80 years.

51:12.836 --> 51:16.639
When Savanah's father died,
he owed me money,

51:16.641 --> 51:18.307
money I couldn't recover.

51:18.309 --> 51:21.844
So, what, then you just
kept the baseball card?

51:21.846 --> 51:25.147
No.
Of course not.

51:25.982 --> 51:27.583
Look...

51:27.585 --> 51:29.852
I feel bad
about their situation.

51:29.854 --> 51:31.454
I really do.

51:31.456 --> 51:33.622
But there's nothing I can do.

51:38.028 --> 51:40.863
Well, then you have...

51:40.865 --> 51:42.965
A good day, Mr. Janson.

51:42.967 --> 51:45.301
I will.

51:47.504 --> 51:50.372
Are you really eating a moonpie?

51:50.374 --> 51:52.775
Do you have a problem with that?

51:52.777 --> 51:54.810
No.

51:54.812 --> 51:56.612
But you eat redneck food.

51:56.614 --> 51:59.448
I do not eat redneck food!

51:59.450 --> 52:02.184
Oh, okay.

52:02.186 --> 52:03.519
What... what else
you got in there?

52:03.521 --> 52:06.689
I bet you anything
it's redneck food.

52:10.894 --> 52:12.328
Pork rinds.

52:12.330 --> 52:15.164
You are such a hick!
No.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.867
Hey, Jason!

52:17.869 --> 52:21.470
You like moonpies,
now, don't you?

52:21.472 --> 52:24.940
Yeah. You know,
they're pretty good deep-fried.

52:24.942 --> 52:26.408
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

52:26.410 --> 52:27.977
- Deep fried?
- Yeah.

52:27.979 --> 52:29.845
You both are total Hicks.

52:31.015 --> 52:33.015
Deep-fried country Hicks.

52:33.017 --> 52:36.452
You know, that is actually
a really good name for a band.

52:36.454 --> 52:38.420
"Dusty and the deep-fried
country Hicks."

52:38.422 --> 52:40.890
You know, I never thought
I'd be hanging out

52:40.892 --> 52:42.591
with two real-life Hicks.

52:42.593 --> 52:43.993
Well, it is your lucky day.

52:43.995 --> 52:46.228
- Here, try a pork rind.
- No, you don't.

52:46.230 --> 52:47.796
No, you have to try one.

52:49.033 --> 52:50.633
Trevor, try it!

52:52.970 --> 52:54.937
Hey.
Hey.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.974
There's blood on star's nose.

52:58.976 --> 53:00.309
What?

53:00.311 --> 53:02.945
What's wrong with you, baby?

53:02.947 --> 53:06.916
Oh, my gosh.
Should we call the vet?

53:06.918 --> 53:10.486
Yes, yeah. Um, wait,
will you just call one?

53:10.488 --> 53:11.687
Yeah.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.222
What happened?

53:21.231 --> 53:23.199
Hey, I need to talk to you.

53:25.168 --> 53:27.403
What's going on with you
and that girl?

53:27.405 --> 53:29.972
Her name's Savanah.

53:29.974 --> 53:32.107
Look, I know you like her,

53:32.109 --> 53:33.842
but do you know who she is,

53:33.844 --> 53:36.045
where she's been,
what's in her past?

53:36.047 --> 53:38.013
Yes, I do, dad.

53:38.015 --> 53:39.615
She's a really good person.

53:39.617 --> 53:41.450
All right, have you taken

53:41.452 --> 53:43.352
a good, strong look
at her mother?

53:43.354 --> 53:45.788
She is a mess.

53:45.790 --> 53:47.790
Apple doesn't fall
very far from the tree.

53:47.792 --> 53:50.292
Now, look, I don't want
to talk about her.

53:50.294 --> 53:51.527
I'm worried about you.

53:51.529 --> 53:54.296
I'm 18.
I have responsibilities, dad.

53:54.298 --> 53:55.764
I understand that.

53:55.766 --> 53:58.234
I just wish you'd think
about it and take your time.

53:58.236 --> 54:00.502
It's like you're just
falling over her.

54:10.714 --> 54:12.448
You know, I gotta say,

54:12.450 --> 54:14.250
I'm glad we got coffee
this trip.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.521
<i>Hey.</i>

54:19.523 --> 54:21.457
<i>I just wanted you
to know that I arrived.</i>

54:21.459 --> 54:22.958
<i>I miss you already.</i>

54:22.960 --> 54:24.627
<i>They're keeping us real busy,</i>

54:24.629 --> 54:27.463
<i>so you may not hear
from me for a while.</i>

54:27.465 --> 54:29.999
<i>Dad, make sure dusty
feeds the goldfish.</i>

54:30.001 --> 54:32.801
<i>We don't want 'em to end up
like the hamster.</i>

54:32.803 --> 54:34.970
<i>And remember,
they can't be in tap water.</i>

54:34.972 --> 54:38.474
<i>Has to be the special stuff
next to the washer.</i>

54:38.476 --> 54:40.276
<i>Okay, I gotta go.</i>

54:40.278 --> 54:41.744
<i>I love you both a lot.</i>

54:41.746 --> 54:42.746
<i>Bye.</i>

54:44.148 --> 54:45.881
Sounds good.

54:47.717 --> 54:49.618
I guess so.

54:49.620 --> 54:51.720
Let's go feed the goldfish.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.825
Love you, too, dad.

55:01.632 --> 55:03.832
It sounds like
he twisted his gut.

55:03.834 --> 55:05.467
What?

55:05.469 --> 55:08.003
And seems like there might be
a bacterial infection.

55:09.407 --> 55:11.407
Let's put him on a heavy
regimen of antibiotics

55:11.409 --> 55:12.975
and see if that helps.

55:12.977 --> 55:17.046
Okay, but... I mean,
he's gonna be okay, right?

55:17.048 --> 55:19.315
Yeah, most likely.

55:19.317 --> 55:22.351
We'll know more
in 24 to 48 hours.

55:23.987 --> 55:26.221
Baby.

55:27.358 --> 55:30.359
Please get better.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.761
<i>The eastern border
with Pakistan...</i>

55:32.763 --> 55:33.629
Thanks.

55:33.631 --> 55:36.031
I'll go save us a table.

55:36.033 --> 55:39.501
<i>Yesterday, us army rangers
began engaging the Taliban...</i>

55:39.503 --> 55:41.503
Wanna watch, cowgirl?

55:41.505 --> 55:44.173
I think I'll pass.

55:44.175 --> 55:45.541
Suit yourself.

55:45.543 --> 55:47.543
<i>Also known
as the valley of death.</i>

55:47.545 --> 55:49.578
<i>Backed by Apache helicopters,</i>

55:49.580 --> 55:52.147
<i>the rangers are meeting
fierce resistance,</i>

55:52.149 --> 55:54.950
<i>and early reports indicate
they are taking heavy...</i>

55:54.952 --> 55:58.287
<i>Go home! Go home! Go home!</i>

55:58.289 --> 55:59.988
<i>Go home! Go home!</i>

55:59.990 --> 56:02.024
Hey!
Leave her alone!

56:02.026 --> 56:04.960
Her father is fighting
Afghanistan right now!

56:04.962 --> 56:07.496
And she is more American
than you'll ever be!

56:07.498 --> 56:09.598
Hey, Calhoun's dad
was killed in 9/11.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.667
So? My hamster
died last week,

56:11.669 --> 56:13.969
and I don't go around
acting like a jerk!

56:16.906 --> 56:18.607
Look...

56:18.609 --> 56:21.143
Don't listen to them, okay?

56:21.145 --> 56:22.511
They're just bullies.

56:28.051 --> 56:31.687
So, I only have two of you
who've given me the books

56:31.689 --> 56:33.455
that you're gonna do
on your book report.

56:34.625 --> 56:35.958
Everybody needs to choose
a book.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.659
It's not that hard.
I can help you.

56:37.661 --> 56:40.596
Come see me after class.
But this is a big deal, guys.

56:40.598 --> 56:42.097
This is 20 percent
of your grade,

56:42.099 --> 56:44.566
so those of you
who aren't doing so well,

56:44.568 --> 56:46.635
you can use this
to boost your grade.

56:46.637 --> 56:48.570
And if you're already
doing well, well, then,

56:48.572 --> 56:51.306
it should just only reinforce
what you're doing, okay?

56:51.308 --> 56:53.308
He's selling the card.

56:53.310 --> 56:54.910
How do you know it's him?

56:54.912 --> 56:57.646
Because there's only three
of that card in existence.

56:57.648 --> 56:59.114
One's in the baseball
hall of fame,

56:59.116 --> 57:01.617
the other's owned
by some family in Europe,

57:01.619 --> 57:05.087
and the third
is in the United States.

57:05.089 --> 57:09.057
The auction is in one week
and the starting bid is...

57:10.760 --> 57:12.294
600.

57:12.296 --> 57:14.129
Six hundred?

57:14.131 --> 57:15.531
Thousand.

57:16.699 --> 57:17.966
Oh.

57:17.968 --> 57:19.635
Yeah, we need to go.

57:31.347 --> 57:33.015
How do you know it's in there?

57:33.017 --> 57:37.419
He still uses the same safe
that he and my dad used.

57:37.421 --> 57:39.087
I saw it when we were in there.

57:41.791 --> 57:44.726
And I know the combination.

57:47.197 --> 57:48.597
Don't even think about it.

57:48.599 --> 57:50.466
Come on, Savanah,
you know what would happen

57:50.468 --> 57:52.201
if you were caught
breaking in in there.

57:52.203 --> 57:53.669
I don't care!

57:53.671 --> 57:55.838
My father left that card for us,

57:55.840 --> 57:58.440
to take care of us if he died.

57:58.442 --> 58:02.444
And you know what?
He did die.

58:02.446 --> 58:04.313
I sense him, dusty.

58:04.315 --> 58:07.816
Every day I feel his presence,
and I can tell that he's sad

58:07.818 --> 58:09.785
because his wishes
weren't honored

58:09.787 --> 58:12.020
and because my mom
and I are struggling.

58:13.022 --> 58:15.057
You would do it
if you were in my shoes.

58:15.059 --> 58:16.592
You know you would.

58:17.961 --> 58:20.829
Are you asking me
to break in there with you?

58:22.599 --> 58:24.566
Savanah, if we get caught,

58:24.568 --> 58:27.402
you're definitely
going back to prison,

58:27.404 --> 58:28.837
probably Alcatraz.

58:28.839 --> 58:31.340
Alcatraz is no longer a prison.

58:31.342 --> 58:32.808
It's a national park.

58:32.810 --> 58:35.043
That doesn't matter.
It's still wrong.

58:39.649 --> 58:41.250
Are you gonna help me or not?

58:44.020 --> 58:48.223
If I help you...

58:48.225 --> 58:50.158
It will just be
a fact-finding mission.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.593
Okay?
Of course.

58:51.595 --> 58:53.595
You cannot take anything.
I won't touch a thing.

58:53.597 --> 58:55.397
And if the card is in that safe,

58:55.399 --> 58:56.732
you're going to keep it there

58:56.734 --> 58:59.167
and we are going to call
the cops, okay?

58:59.169 --> 59:00.602
Thank you, dusty.

59:05.576 --> 59:07.543
I see your smile.

59:10.113 --> 59:11.780
Okay, let's go.
You're a lot of work.

59:11.782 --> 59:13.048
You love me.

59:13.050 --> 59:16.184
I reckon
this'll make us even now.

59:16.186 --> 59:18.687
But who's keeping track
anyway, right?

59:20.189 --> 59:22.124
This is crazy.
We shouldn't do this, Savanah.

59:22.126 --> 59:24.126
It's fine, okay?
What do you mean, it's fine?

59:24.128 --> 59:27.296
It's... it's fine.
What are you doing?

59:27.298 --> 59:30.098
What? I'm lifting...

59:30.100 --> 59:32.868
I'm both impressed and extremely
disappointed in you right now.

59:32.870 --> 59:34.937
- Help me.
- Yeah.

59:34.939 --> 59:36.138
Go.

59:37.240 --> 59:39.575
Here, you go first.

59:39.577 --> 59:41.143
It's fine.

59:46.916 --> 59:48.750
I don't know where...

59:51.554 --> 59:53.188
Be careful.
I'm sorry.

59:53.190 --> 59:55.524
I'm not a professional
breaker-inner like you.

59:55.526 --> 59:57.159
It's "burglar."

59:57.161 --> 59:59.361
What? Same thing.

59:59.363 --> 01:00:00.495
No, it's not.

01:00:00.497 --> 01:00:01.663
Where are we supposed to go?

01:00:01.665 --> 01:00:03.198
Shh!
What?

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:16.111
I told you.

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:17.379
Is that it?

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:28.957
It worked.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.094
Is that it?

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.139
Oh, my god.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.712
You weren't kidding.

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:52.881
Hello, Mr. Ruth.

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:58.420
What is that?
I don't know.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.762
Dusty.
What?

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:09.498
What does it say?

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.000
"Pete...

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.836
Will you hold onto
my babe Ruth Ba...

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:18.874
Babe Ruth baseball card
while I'm overseas?

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:20.976
In the event
that I'm killed in action,

01:01:20.978 --> 01:01:24.713
please make sure Cheryl
and Savanah get this.

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:27.816
Your friend and partner,
John Stocker."

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:30.218
Dad.

01:01:31.421 --> 01:01:33.321
He left it for us.

01:01:35.558 --> 01:01:38.660
He loved you both so much.

01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:40.328
Yeah, he did.

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.332
You were right.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.904
Okay, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

01:01:48.906 --> 01:01:51.406
Hey, put it back.
Put it back, Savanah.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.376
No. No, this is mine.
This is mine, dusty.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:57.946
You have to put it back, okay?
You promised me.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:00.949
Put it back.
Please.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.265
Hello, officers.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.633
I am so sorry.
This is not...

01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:19.935
Not what it looks like.

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:22.137
It's exactly what it looks like.

01:02:22.139 --> 01:02:24.606
Got a b&e,
breaking and entering.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:26.208
Come with me right now, ladies.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:27.309
Of course.

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:28.276
I didn't know "b&e"

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:29.911
stood for
"breaking and entering."

01:02:32.015 --> 01:02:34.249
I'm telling you,
the man who owns the business

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.917
stole a baseball card
from my family,

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.619
and we were just
verifying he had it.

01:02:37.621 --> 01:02:39.321
Really?
A baseball card.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:41.289
Yes, she's telling the truth.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.592
It's a rare card,
and it's worth a lot of money.

01:02:43.594 --> 01:02:45.627
A 1914 babe Ruth.

01:02:45.629 --> 01:02:48.330
Don't worry about it, ladies.
The judge will handle it.

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:49.931
Go ahead and have a seat.
Here?

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.567
Right here.
Really?

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:01.343
I'm sorry.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:02.844
It's okay.

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:12.521
Call him back.
See if they're available.

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:19.261
Oh, hello, officers.
I'm a military chaplain.

01:03:19.263 --> 01:03:20.762
That's my granddaughter there.

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:22.998
I don't know what she's here for

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.900
or what you think happened,

01:03:24.902 --> 01:03:27.736
but I hope you can have
some compassion

01:03:27.738 --> 01:03:28.870
for what we're doing here.

01:03:28.872 --> 01:03:30.672
She's a good girl.

01:03:30.674 --> 01:03:32.941
Go get miss Rhodes, please.

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:35.310
Dusty Rhodes?

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.513
Just me?

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:42.417
Okay?

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.626
Gramps.

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:54.896
Dusty, sweetheart...

01:03:54.898 --> 01:03:59.835
Your mom's helicopter went down.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.710
It... it went...
It went down?

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:10.078
Yes.

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.648
Like, it crashed?

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:15.450
Yes.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.389
Is... is she alive?

01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:22.490
They think so, okay?

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:24.993
There are search teams
looking for her now.

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:40.308
All things considered,
you guys can go home now.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:44.679
Thank you.
Let's go home and pray.

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.281
Wait.

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:49.651
Savanah.

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.954
No, Savanah can't go.

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:54.623
You know she has a prior record.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:55.891
She...
No.

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.893
No, go.
Just go.

01:04:57.895 --> 01:04:59.561
I'm not leaving
without you, okay?

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:02.197
I'm okay, just go.
No, you're not. Come.

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:11.172
I can't leave without her.

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:20.015
The property owner said
that nothing is missing.

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:22.817
You can both go,
but we will follow up

01:05:22.819 --> 01:05:26.121
on the breaking and entering,
so don't leave town.

01:05:26.123 --> 01:05:28.957
Thank you.
Let's go, girls.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:17.005
Hey, Jason, wait up.
What's wrong?

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:19.107
Why haven't you returned
any of my texts?

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:21.209
Nothing's wrong.
I've been busy, okay?

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:24.446
Was I just imagining that there
was something between us?

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:30.151
No, you weren't
just imagining it.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.954
Okay, fine.

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:35.457
Then what happened?

01:06:38.861 --> 01:06:41.396
Savanah...

01:06:41.398 --> 01:06:45.333
You're so beautiful
and worldly and everything.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:48.236
Just...
After the party,

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:51.206
I thought that you wouldn't
want to have anything to do

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:54.275
with a deep-fried
country hick like me.

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:59.547
You... you've been ignoring me
'cause I called you a hick?

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.516
I was kidding.

01:07:01.518 --> 01:07:03.651
My family...

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:05.787
They want me to start
running the family business,

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:11.192
and I'm probably gonna be
in college next year.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:13.261
And where would that
leave us, huh?

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:21.069
Your father doesn't want you
to see me, does he?

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:24.506
Because I was in juvie.
Because I'm poor.

01:07:24.508 --> 01:07:28.009
Savanah, that's...
That's not it...

01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:31.379
Is that all it took
for you to walk away?

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:33.581
I would have fought for you.

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.653
Because I felt something
I've never felt before.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:45.627
You're right, though.

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.296
We are different.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:52.867
And not because I'm city
and you're country.

01:07:52.869 --> 01:07:54.436
We're different

01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:57.672
because I'm not afraid
to fight for what I want.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.743
You should try that sometime.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:16.124
Why is that happening?

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:17.358
Shh, it's okay.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.893
It's gonna
make you better, star.

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:20.228
It's gonna make you better.

01:08:39.247 --> 01:08:41.983
It's okay.

01:08:45.055 --> 01:08:48.590
You're the best horse ever.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:50.492
My best friend.

01:08:52.094 --> 01:08:54.562
I love you so much.

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.332
I love you.

01:08:58.434 --> 01:09:00.702
Star was a great horse.

01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:04.639
He always whinnied
when he saw me,

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.309
and that's how he showed me
that he loved me

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:10.411
just like I loved him.

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:14.916
I don't know why
one horse dies and...

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.518
Another one doesn't.

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:24.091
And I don't know
why one soldier dies

01:09:24.094 --> 01:09:26.861
and the other one doesn't.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.765
Life can be so beautiful
at one moment

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:36.203
and... So heartbreaking
the next.

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.843
I want to trust
that god has a plan,

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:44.511
but it is moments
like these that...

01:09:46.948 --> 01:09:49.317
I'm just not so sure.

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:54.889
Thank you,
Jason and Mr. carver,

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.659
for letting star rest
in this beautiful spot.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.553
We're gonna go.

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:36.731
Dusty, dusty,
can I tell you something?

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.067
Please.

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:42.303
God loves horses.

01:10:42.305 --> 01:10:44.606
He created them.

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:46.874
And the Bible says
when Jesus comes again,

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:52.747
he's gonna be riding
on a big white horse.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:57.018
And I think we're gonna
see star again.

01:10:59.722 --> 01:11:01.356
I hope so.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:05.720
Sweetheart? You okay?

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:09.857
No.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.360
I know.

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:16.964
Any news?

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:19.934
Well, they have widened
the search area.

01:12:19.936 --> 01:12:22.470
That's all Mike could tell me.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.841
She could be gone.

01:12:29.211 --> 01:12:32.046
I know this is the hardest thing
you've ever gone through...

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:34.916
We've ever gone through.

01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:36.918
It is.

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:42.557
And I just keep on wondering...

01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:44.726
Where is god?

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.528
You know...

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:51.466
Where is god when we...

01:12:51.468 --> 01:12:54.402
When we really need him?

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:59.140
Honey, I don't have
all the answers.

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:01.275
I do know...

01:13:01.277 --> 01:13:03.277
He has a plan for all of us,

01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:05.413
but I don't know
what that plan is.

01:13:06.749 --> 01:13:09.817
That's why we have to have
faith in his wisdom.

01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:13.221
This is not
my first rodeo with god.

01:13:13.223 --> 01:13:14.956
Don't give up on him, dusty.

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:18.426
Don't give up on him,
and I promise

01:13:18.428 --> 01:13:20.027
he won't give up on you.

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:24.966
Whatever his will is,
we will carry on.

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:29.270
We will live our lives.
We'll... we'll be okay.

01:13:29.272 --> 01:13:32.673
By god's grace, we will be okay.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.228
Hey.

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:06.667
Hey.

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:12.807
Sorry about your horse.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.913
Thanks.

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:26.220
What are you doing here?

01:15:26.222 --> 01:15:27.255
I'm just hanging.

01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:29.156
I...

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.559
I feel...

01:15:31.561 --> 01:15:34.128
Peaceful when I sit in here.

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:38.432
I'm surprised the walls
are still standing.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:41.602
Yeah, I know.

01:15:46.376 --> 01:15:49.610
My whole life I've been so...

01:15:49.612 --> 01:15:53.047
Angry about my father.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:56.617
I... I was sure there...
There couldn't be a god,

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:58.352
because how could...

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:01.556
How could a god
let that happen to my dad?

01:16:01.558 --> 01:16:03.124
I mean, he didn't...

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:04.725
He didn't even work
in those towers.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:08.029
He just... he just happened
to be there.

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.965
I mean, it's totally random.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:13.401
Could have happened to anyone.

01:16:15.138 --> 01:16:17.738
After you gave me
that beat-down...

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.076
I ended up in here,
in this church.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:25.846
And for some reason...
Heh, heh.

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:28.749
I... I actually prayed.

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:32.219
And i...
And I felt better.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.726
I felt lighter,
like... like...

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:40.561
Like maybe I wasn't alone.

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:42.063
You know, maybe...

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:44.832
Maybe I didn't have
to go through life alone.

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:49.170
You know, it...
For the first time, i...

01:16:49.172 --> 01:16:51.973
I was willing to consider
the possibility that...

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.076
maybe there is a god.

01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:06.287
I'm really...
Sorry about your dad.

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:10.191
I'm sorry about your mom.

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:13.894
And your hamster.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:18.199
I can't believe I said that.

01:17:20.370 --> 01:17:22.670
You did, but it's okay.

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:24.171
I forgive you.

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:29.043
Do you...

01:17:29.045 --> 01:17:30.945
Do you want to pray together?

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:40.554
I'm sorry, but I don't...
I don't really do that.

01:17:40.556 --> 01:17:42.490
But...

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:46.427
I feel like there's a reason
you walked in here today.

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:47.862
Don't you?

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.402
I could try.

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:03.471
Hey.

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:06.807
You're back.

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:10.644
Uh... Not exactly.

01:19:10.646 --> 01:19:12.446
I just, um...

01:19:13.682 --> 01:19:15.516
came to get this.

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.953
Well, that new stallion came in,

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:20.287
if you want to meet him.

01:19:21.623 --> 01:19:23.390
No, thank you.

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:25.993
How's Savanah?

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.897
I don't know.

01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:31.732
Maybe <i> you</i> should ask her.

01:19:31.734 --> 01:19:35.469
Dusty... come on, now.

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:41.842
She really liked you,
Jason, a lot.

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:46.413
But you messed it up.

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:02.963
What?

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.934
Oh, no, I've...
I've heard about you.

01:20:06.936 --> 01:20:09.804
Jason just told me
all about you.

01:20:11.741 --> 01:20:13.073
I know that you think
you're cute.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:16.710
You are,
but I'm not interested, okay?

01:20:16.712 --> 01:20:21.749
So you can go do your cute
little thing for someone else.

01:20:21.751 --> 01:20:25.319
I said, someone else.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:28.656
I'm not... I'm not looking
for another horse, okay?

01:20:28.658 --> 01:20:30.825
I know that you think
that you're the only horse

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:33.360
in the world, but you're not.

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:37.398
Gosh.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.200
Wish me luck.

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.941
Everyone's been trying
to get ahold of you.

01:20:46.943 --> 01:20:48.976
I'm right here.

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:54.114
Look, Trevor, I am so sorry
that I shut you out.

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:55.382
You mean so much to me...

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:57.952
Dusty, your father's
been wounded.

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:02.489
How bad?

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:07.661
The sergeant I talked to
doesn't know.

01:21:07.663 --> 01:21:09.663
But it happened a few days ago.

01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:11.665
Where is he?

01:21:11.667 --> 01:21:14.869
There's a lot of confusion
right now,

01:21:14.871 --> 01:21:16.904
and it sounds crazy,

01:21:16.906 --> 01:21:19.406
but he might already
be at the Va.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:20.875
Here?
Yeah.

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:23.577
Can you take me?

01:21:23.579 --> 01:21:25.312
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.069
Ahem, hi, um,

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.472
is lieutenant Randall Rhodes
a patient here?

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:52.907
I'm his daughter.

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.450
Dusty?

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:06.954
Daddy!

01:22:07.822 --> 01:22:09.323
Daddy, you're okay.

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:12.092
I'm okay, sweetheart.
Oh, my gosh.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.827
You came home.

01:22:13.829 --> 01:22:15.896
I told you I would.

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:19.300
It's okay, I'm here.

01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:21.969
The latest report
is that her helicopter went down

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:23.904
on the Afghani/Pakistan border.

01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:25.906
There are search teams
and drones

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:27.808
searching every square mile
of that area.

01:22:27.810 --> 01:22:29.977
Thank you, Mike.

01:22:29.979 --> 01:22:33.113
Daddy, these are my friends.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:36.216
Thanks for looking after dusty
while I was gone.

01:22:36.218 --> 01:22:38.585
She's a lot of work,
that's for sure.

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:40.220
Hey.

01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:43.657
Tell me about it.
Can you imagine 17 years?

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.927
- Nope, I can't.
- Hey!

01:22:46.929 --> 01:22:49.129
Don't encourage her.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.564
You know,
someone told me you all

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:53.133
were riding
in a rodeo this weekend.

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:57.004
Yeah, dad, uh, we were going to,

01:22:57.006 --> 01:22:58.906
but we told them
to find somebody else.

01:22:58.908 --> 01:23:00.774
Well, that's too bad.

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:02.376
I could've used a night out.

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:07.581
You would have been up
for something like that?

01:23:09.385 --> 01:23:10.617
Yeah.

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:13.354
I think I can handle it.

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:16.824
Dusty, um, I'll bet
they haven't found

01:23:16.826 --> 01:23:18.892
a team to replace you.

01:23:18.894 --> 01:23:21.061
I bet not.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.432
So what do you guys say?

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.868
Should we do something special

01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:29.737
for my mom?

01:23:29.739 --> 01:23:31.605
I think it's meant to be.

01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:36.076
Go, rangers!
Go, rangers!

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:39.580
Yahoo!

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.093
Yeah.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.363
Hey, dusty.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:58.198
Calhoun.

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:02.036
She's right over there.

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:03.037
Thank you.

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:06.006
Um, welcome home, sir.

01:24:06.008 --> 01:24:07.508
Thank you.

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:16.250
What's that all about?

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:18.919
That...

01:24:18.921 --> 01:24:21.221
Is kind of a miracle...

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:24.191
right before our eyes.

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:43.277
What are you doing here?

01:24:43.279 --> 01:24:45.879
I convinced her to come.

01:24:45.881 --> 01:24:48.415
Took a lot of convincing.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.251
Basically, she's more
stubborn than a mule.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:54.321
Yeah, well, this cowboy here
is pretty persuasive

01:24:54.323 --> 01:24:58.058
'cause he convinced me
to get up off my butt and...

01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:00.627
come out and support
my daughter.

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.931
So here I am.

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:06.133
I'm really glad you're here.

01:25:09.671 --> 01:25:11.171
Come meet my horse.

01:25:11.173 --> 01:25:12.539
Okay.

01:25:28.857 --> 01:25:30.424
Thank you.

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:33.193
My pleasure.

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.377
Hello, chaplain.
Hi, Pete.

01:25:50.379 --> 01:25:52.412
I appreciated
our talk yesterday.

01:25:52.414 --> 01:25:55.816
Now, you just do whatever
you feel in your heart, okay?

01:25:55.818 --> 01:25:57.551
Yes, sir.
Let's go.

01:25:58.653 --> 01:26:01.922
All right, you got
some big hooves to fill.

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:06.793
You see,
star was a special horse,

01:26:06.795 --> 01:26:10.497
but I think there's something
special about you too.

01:26:11.933 --> 01:26:13.834
So let's go out there,

01:26:13.836 --> 01:26:16.870
and let's give them
one heck of a show tonight.

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.541
For my mom, okay?

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:23.744
Hey.
Hey.

01:26:23.746 --> 01:26:25.279
Uh...

01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:26.880
Everything's been
so crazy lately,

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:30.384
I haven't really had
a chance to talk to you.

01:26:30.386 --> 01:26:34.321
But I just wanted to tell you...

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.957
good luck.

01:26:38.092 --> 01:26:39.793
Thank you.

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:45.966
One more thing.

01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:47.301
Yeah?
One more thing.

01:26:54.075 --> 01:26:56.310
So i...
I'll see you later.

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.780
Good luck.
Thanks.

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:10.257
What are you looking at?

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:16.964
Mom, someone's coming.

01:27:23.471 --> 01:27:26.573
Cheryl, Savanah...

01:27:26.575 --> 01:27:29.276
I hope that someday
you can forgive me

01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:32.679
for not...
Not giving this to you sooner.

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:41.154
John asked me
to give that to you

01:27:41.156 --> 01:27:43.056
in the event of his death.

01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:45.325
But then I didn't.

01:27:45.327 --> 01:27:47.461
I don't know why,

01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:50.697
or how I could've done
something so terrible.

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:53.834
But you didn't deserve
to lose a husband and a father

01:27:53.836 --> 01:27:55.435
and then be cheated
out of something

01:27:55.437 --> 01:27:57.537
he intentionally meant
for you to have.

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:01.842
Thank you.

01:28:02.844 --> 01:28:04.778
Good man, Pete.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:09.583
I-I am a much better man
than my actions have shown.

01:28:11.185 --> 01:28:12.619
I am, and I won't blame you

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:16.123
if you need to press charges
against me.

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:18.492
Just know I'll cooperate fully.

01:28:20.963 --> 01:28:24.331
We won't be pressing charges,
Mr. Janson.

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:29.670
But I will be keeping
that laptop I took from you.

01:28:31.707 --> 01:28:33.240
Good.

01:28:33.242 --> 01:28:35.809
I'm sure you can
use it in school.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.978
Thanks.

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:40.047
Have a good performance.

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:49.289
It's a great day.

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:52.392
It truly is.

01:28:52.394 --> 01:28:54.127
Thank you.

01:28:54.129 --> 01:28:56.029
Don't thank me.

01:29:03.738 --> 01:29:06.907
I just saw Mr. Janson.
What was that about?

01:29:06.909 --> 01:29:08.175
Dusty.
What?

01:29:08.177 --> 01:29:10.110
He gave the card back.

01:29:10.112 --> 01:29:11.878
He did?
He did.

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:12.846
He did?
He did.

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:16.483
Savanah, that...

01:29:16.485 --> 01:29:18.485
I am so happy for you.

01:29:18.487 --> 01:29:19.786
Thank you.

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:25.425
You know...

01:29:25.427 --> 01:29:29.129
A hundred times
I've sensed my father.

01:29:29.131 --> 01:29:33.133
And now the feeling
is stronger than it's ever been.

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:39.906
He's here...
Watching us right now.

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:42.109
I can feel him too.

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:51.785
And I can tell that he's...
He's finally at peace.

01:29:53.421 --> 01:29:57.324
And somehow,
I feel at peace too.

01:29:57.326 --> 01:29:58.525
Like...

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:02.396
Maybe everything
is gonna be okay.

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:08.168
Everything is going to be okay.

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.177
Come on.

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:26.520
All right, girls, this is it!

01:30:26.522 --> 01:30:29.289
I could not be more proud
of you guys.

01:30:29.291 --> 01:30:30.657
Thank you, dusty.
Thanks, dusty!

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:32.592
Love you, dusty!
Love you.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:34.428
Love you, cowgirl.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:37.631
All right.

01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:39.266
Rangers lead the way?

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:41.535
All the way!

01:30:41.537 --> 01:30:43.837
Let's go!
Whoo!

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.543
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:52.312
<i>there they are,
riding for Jefferson high</i>

01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:56.349
<i>and the United States army,
the rangers!</i>

01:31:44.065 --> 01:31:45.699
Welcome, everyone.

01:31:45.701 --> 01:31:47.834
Today we are honoring
the soldiers

01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:50.337
who are fighting
to protect our country

01:31:50.339 --> 01:31:51.805
and all of the men and women

01:31:51.807 --> 01:31:55.442
who have fought
and given so much.

01:31:55.444 --> 01:31:58.612
Some of the brave soldiers
are here with us tonight,

01:31:58.614 --> 01:32:00.881
including my father,

01:32:00.883 --> 01:32:03.483
first lieutenant Randall Rhodes.

01:32:07.889 --> 01:32:11.258
My dad was seriously injured
in Afghanistan,

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:15.462
but he never lost his faith.

01:32:15.464 --> 01:32:17.531
You know, someone once told me

01:32:17.533 --> 01:32:20.934
that you can't do faith halfway.

01:32:22.403 --> 01:32:26.640
And now, more than ever...

01:32:26.642 --> 01:32:30.277
I know that that is true.

01:32:30.279 --> 01:32:34.481
Thank you for serving
this country, dad.

01:32:34.483 --> 01:32:36.383
And thank you for being
the best father

01:32:36.385 --> 01:32:38.084
a girl could ever hope for.

01:32:44.458 --> 01:32:46.526
As some of you may know,
my mother,

01:32:46.528 --> 01:32:47.861
lieutenant Helen Rhodes,

01:32:47.863 --> 01:32:50.597
is currently missing
in Afghanistan.

01:32:50.599 --> 01:32:52.532
Please bow your heads
as chaplain Rhodes

01:32:52.534 --> 01:32:54.901
recites a prayer for her

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:57.370
and all of the brave men
and women serving

01:32:57.372 --> 01:32:59.506
to keep our country safe.

01:32:59.508 --> 01:33:01.141
Grandpa?

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:08.048
Father, I offer these words...

01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:10.750
They're your words
from the Bible...

01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:13.887
As a special prayer
for every man and woman

01:33:13.889 --> 01:33:18.959
in the American military
now and always.

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.462
The lord...

01:33:22.464 --> 01:33:24.564
Is my Shepherd.

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:26.700
I shall not want.

01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:30.737
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

01:33:30.739 --> 01:33:34.174
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

01:33:34.176 --> 01:33:36.910
He restoreth my soul.

01:33:36.912 --> 01:33:39.379
He leadeth me
in paths of righteousness

01:33:39.381 --> 01:33:41.214
for his namesake.

01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:44.351
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

01:33:44.353 --> 01:33:46.286
of the shadow of death,

01:33:46.288 --> 01:33:49.789
I will fear no evil
for thou art with me.

01:33:49.791 --> 01:33:53.126
Thy rod, thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:56.429
Thou preparest a table before me

01:33:56.431 --> 01:33:58.832
in the presence of my enemies.

01:33:58.834 --> 01:34:01.301
Thou annointest my head
with oil.

01:34:01.303 --> 01:34:03.903
My cup runneth over.

01:34:03.905 --> 01:34:08.541
Surely goodness
and mercy shall follow me

01:34:08.543 --> 01:34:11.111
all the days of my life,

01:34:11.113 --> 01:34:15.081
and I will dwell
in the house of the lord...

01:34:15.083 --> 01:34:17.017
Forever.

01:34:17.019 --> 01:34:18.585
Amen.

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:27.527
Really?
Okay, all right.

01:34:27.529 --> 01:34:28.995
I've got this.

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:32.999
Thank you, chaplain Rhodes,
and thank you, dusty.

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:35.568
And how about it
for our ranger cowgirls?

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:46.946
Sometimes it seems that
when the day is the darkest,

01:34:46.948 --> 01:34:49.182
when it appears
that there is no hope,

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.851
a shaft of light
breaks through the clouds

01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:56.189
and touches us and reminds us
of god's grace.

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:57.924
Dusty, Randall,

01:34:57.926 --> 01:35:00.393
I know you've been
worried sick about Helen.

01:35:00.395 --> 01:35:05.231
Well, hang on to your hats,
because miracles do happen.

01:35:05.233 --> 01:35:07.834
She's being driven up right now.

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:14.741
Mom? Mom!
