00:21.320 --> 00:24.560
Criminal case 19504,

00:24.560 --> 00:27.440
United States
versus Zaid al-Safarini.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.200
Welcome to
the United States District Court.

00:32.200 --> 00:36.280
I invite anyone who would like to
speak to the court today to do so.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.320
We never talk about it.

00:48.960 --> 00:51.080
35 years have gone by.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.160
But some things stay in the memory.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.600
Mr Maisel.
Thank you, Your Honour.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.040
We are here to remember.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.400
Reports coming in on the apparent
hijacking of a Pan American 747.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.040
We are here to recount.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.880
We are here to bear witness.

01:15.320 --> 01:18.400
We are here to punish.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.000
I hope he suffers.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.400
We are here for justice.
Safarini?

01:40.760 --> 01:45.960
TWA flight 847 with 39 Americans
taken hostage for 17 days.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.200
Rome Airport,
just days after Christmas.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.840
This incredibly dangerous
and dramatic situation...

01:51.840 --> 01:53.480
People are being held here
as hostage...

01:58.080 --> 02:01.000
Terrorists are not freedom fighters
or anything else.

02:05.800 --> 02:09.800
Palestine is a battlefield
and it is our land.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.120
A ten-year-old boy inherits the gun
of the dead Fedayeen.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.720
He could well become a terrorist.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.560
As terror spreads
across the Middle East,

02:26.560 --> 02:30.600
the '80s had surely become the age
of the airline attack.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.400
I hope nothing happens.
I think we'll be fine.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.760
And, of course, Libya has a finger
in most terrorist pies.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.520
My fellow Americans,
at seven o'clock this evening,

02:41.520 --> 02:45.320
air and naval forces
launched a series of strikes

02:45.320 --> 02:47.160
against Muammar Gaddafi.

02:48.160 --> 02:51.720
The raid on Colonel Gaddafi's
headquarters in Tripoli

02:51.720 --> 02:56.280
killing an adopted daughter.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.560
This pre-emptive action
will provide him with incentives

02:59.560 --> 03:02.040
and reasons to alter
his criminal behaviour.

03:39.560 --> 03:42.840
Karachi was just to pick up
passengers, drop off people

03:42.840 --> 03:44.960
from Bombay, and then carry on.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.600
I was desperate to get home.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.880
I had a couple of friends
hiking with me in Pakistan.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.960
We had walked up
to Broad Peak base camp,

03:57.960 --> 03:59.560
which is right at the foot of K2.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.480
Every day it was incredibly hot.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.040
We hadn't had a decent meal.

04:08.040 --> 04:12.280
And I felt exhausted
at the end of all of that.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.560
In the Pan Am office, a woman said,

04:17.560 --> 04:21.160
"Yes, I have a flight from Karachi
to Frankfurt to London."

04:21.160 --> 04:24.680
It was a business-class seat.
I had never flown business class.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.680
And I thought, "This is fantastic."

04:40.040 --> 04:44.560
I made my parents
buy me a ticket to India

04:44.560 --> 04:47.240
and spend my summer vacation there.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.600
It was a great summer.
But you wanna get back home.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.440
I was travelling
as an unaccompanied minor.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.240
I really had to persuade my mom
to send me.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.160
I'm her only child. I told her,

05:05.160 --> 05:07.920
"It'll be great,
I'll be a good boy."

05:07.920 --> 05:10.560
The one thing my mom
was very keen on is,

05:10.560 --> 05:13.360
"Hey, listen,
I want you to come back,

05:13.360 --> 05:18.840
so don't lose your passport,
Dwijal, or else."

05:22.720 --> 05:25.520
We were travelling
to the US that day.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.280
I finished my masters
and she finished her education

05:29.280 --> 05:33.440
and then we decided to move there
for better studies.

05:33.440 --> 05:37.200
We were sitting in the aisle seat
in the middle in economy class.

05:37.200 --> 05:42.400
My sister Sana and my brother Imran.
Three of us.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.440
I was 24.

05:45.480 --> 05:50.000
I was 24? I was born in '62, so...

05:51.080 --> 05:53.960
I don't know how old I was.
I stopped counting my age.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.680
The first thing I heard
was shouting.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.720
Move or we will kill!

06:15.720 --> 06:18.080
We heard automatic fire.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.840
Move in!

06:19.840 --> 06:23.200
And saw the security guy
holding onto a passenger.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.600
My first thought was

06:25.600 --> 06:28.080
maybe the passenger was a criminal
or something.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.040
Down! Everyone sit down!

06:32.040 --> 06:34.480
I saw a man struggling
with one of the flight attendants

06:34.480 --> 06:36.520
in the second doorway.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.040
I didn't think of,
sort of, running away.

06:39.040 --> 06:42.440
I just stared at him and thought,
"That's a man with a gun."

06:42.440 --> 06:44.240
Everybody get down!

06:44.240 --> 06:47.080
Behind me, in the front doorway,

06:47.080 --> 06:50.720
there was another man in uniform
with a rifle.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.560
I thought that he was on my side.
You have been hijacked!

06:54.560 --> 06:59.120
There were four of them on board.
Two guys came from the front.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.320
Look down! Don't look at me!

07:01.320 --> 07:03.440
And then there was two guys
at the back.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.800
They were wearing blue uniforms,
light-blue uniforms.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.120
Look down!

07:09.120 --> 07:12.880
They look like safety guys. They are
the policemen. What's happening?

07:12.880 --> 07:15.520
Everyone sit down!

07:15.520 --> 07:17.760
Sit down! Hands up!

07:17.760 --> 07:21.400
I saw a man shouting, "Hands up!"

07:21.400 --> 07:23.640
Hands up, like that. Like that.

07:23.640 --> 07:27.520
Up!
We saw, like, the hand grenade.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.000
And that was the point
when you just freeze.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.200
Don't look at me! Higher! Up! Up!

07:35.200 --> 07:37.960
One of the guys looked like a kid.

07:37.960 --> 07:40.120
Nobody move!

07:40.120 --> 07:44.800
The young hijacker,
he looked into my eyes.

07:46.040 --> 07:49.960
It's very hard for me to forget.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.080
Don't look at me!
What did I tell you?

07:52.080 --> 07:55.800
And he was a bit harsh, you know.
A bit harsh?

07:57.280 --> 08:01.120
Hijack!
Anyone move and they get hurt!

08:01.120 --> 08:03.760
My 11-year-old brain

08:03.760 --> 08:06.280
was used to going through drills,

08:06.280 --> 08:08.600
fire drills at school,
earthquake drills.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.880
"Ah, it's just another drill.
It's a hijack drill."

08:13.320 --> 08:16.640
I do remember other children
starting to cry

08:16.640 --> 08:21.440
and I remember at the time
priding myself cos I wasn't crying.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.960
You, too! Look down! Don't move!

08:23.960 --> 08:27.920
I dialled the emergency number
for the cockpit.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.320
And then I gave the code
for a hijacking.

08:34.039 --> 08:39.000
On this 747, the cockpit crew
is on the upper deck.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.480
So they would not be able to see
what was happening in the main deck.

08:43.600 --> 08:47.520
My flight engineer,
he came right back in the cockpit

08:47.520 --> 08:49.280
and was in a panic.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.520
I felt very frightened.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.880
And then we had the first
announcement in English.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.640
"Ladies and gentlemen,
the group responsible apologise

09:01.640 --> 09:04.960
for the inconvenience caused.
Their argument is not with you.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.000
They do not wish to hurt anyone.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.120
But if you make any sudden movement,
you will be shot."

09:19.000 --> 09:23.160
When I saw that the ad for Pan Am
said they were hiring

09:23.160 --> 09:25.920
flight attendants
from Mumbai, India,

09:25.920 --> 09:28.520
I was excited.

09:29.880 --> 09:33.800
Pan Am was an international carrier.
It kind of made history.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.040
There were 10,000 applications.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.320
They had never done
anything like that before.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.880
They'd only ever had
flight attendants from the US.

09:46.920 --> 09:51.800
I was born in Bombay. I always
wanted to be a flight attendant.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.040
Pan Am was a legend.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.440
Anywhere in the world you went,
there's two names people knew.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.520
Coca-Cola and Pan Am.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.160
'More style,
more luxury in the sky.'

10:08.160 --> 10:12.320
It had the reputation of being one
of the best airlines in the world.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.680
So prestigious,
you want to give it your best.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.120
Because being America,
you had to be super slim.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.080
You had to look a certain way.
You had to dress a certain way.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.760
You had to act a certain way.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.520
We were a young bunch of
enthusiastic, excited young people.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.080
I was over the moon.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.880
A dream come true.

10:46.360 --> 10:48.960
It was that bond that we shared.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.920
It was about two and a half months

10:55.920 --> 10:59.400
we had started as full-fledged crew.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.360
I had done
about eight or nine flights.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.760
10 to 12 flights.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.680
I just... I loved it.
I just loved it.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.040
Keep your hands up, all of you!

11:14.040 --> 11:16.680
Don't look at me! Look down!

11:22.160 --> 11:24.640
One of them shouted
a list of instructions.

11:24.640 --> 11:29.520
It sounded to me as if this was
the leader of the terrorists.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.280
I didn't want to look him in the eye.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.200
Move. You, come!

11:33.200 --> 11:38.480
He was the real deal.
Quick! Come! Where are the pilots?

11:48.800 --> 11:52.320
'An aircraft on the ground,
effectively immobilised,

11:52.320 --> 11:56.080
is the best solution
to reduce risk of harm to hostages.'

11:58.920 --> 12:01.600
We knew that we had to do
everything we could

12:01.600 --> 12:05.840
to make this airplane unusable
and to exit and get out of here.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.120
'Your possibilities for survival
are greatly reduced

12:09.120 --> 12:11.560
when the plane is airborne.'

12:11.560 --> 12:13.120
Open the door. Open it!

12:13.120 --> 12:16.200
'Remember to keep the hijacker
out of the cockpit if possible.'

12:16.200 --> 12:19.280
Open the door!
Captain, can you hear me?

12:23.320 --> 12:26.040
Key.
I do not have a key, sir.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.800
Captain.
Open the door.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.400
I had the key all the time.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.600
Open the door.
I do not have access.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.840
Open the door.
I am asking them to open the door.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.280
Captain, can you come to the door,
- please?
- Move, move!

12:39.280 --> 12:41.640
The flimsiest door in the world.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.840
He just pushed me aside
and kicked it in.

12:48.040 --> 12:50.520
'In security training,
crew members have been told

12:50.520 --> 12:53.040
to consider the possibilities
of escaping.'

12:59.320 --> 13:03.040
He was in shock.
Like, "Now what do I do?"

13:03.040 --> 13:05.120
You wear the hat.

13:05.120 --> 13:09.360
I'm not the captain,
I can't fly a plane, so no.

13:15.640 --> 13:16.760
Move.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.480
Your knowledge of past hijackings,

13:27.480 --> 13:30.480
emergency procedures
and aircraft equipment

13:30.480 --> 13:33.040
will help you
to assess the situation

13:33.040 --> 13:36.000
and take the actions
you believe to be appropriate

13:36.000 --> 13:38.680
in order to minimise danger.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.680
The cockpit crew had left
and I knew how they would have

13:41.680 --> 13:44.040
because we learned that in training.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.760
I felt deserted,

13:46.760 --> 13:52.520
that they had left us to handle
this... ordeal on our own.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.400
It was hard to leave the cockpit,

13:57.400 --> 14:02.080
to leave the flight attendants
with these terrorists.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.920
You feel like you're abandoning them.

14:07.080 --> 14:11.440
You don't know what's gonna happen,
what's next.

14:16.520 --> 14:20.240
Everybody get up. Out of your seats.
Move!

14:20.240 --> 14:21.880
Up! Move!

14:21.880 --> 14:25.200
'Obviously, it is not possible
to plan a specific course of action

14:25.200 --> 14:27.720
for every emergency.'
Move!

14:27.720 --> 14:29.680
'Each situation is unique

14:29.680 --> 14:33.480
and judgements appropriate
to the situation must be made.'

14:33.480 --> 14:38.160
- Move!
- They wanted the passengers
to be collected in one place.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.720
Move!
Sardined together in the centre.

14:42.280 --> 14:43.680
Walk.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.080
Hands up.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.200
People were crowding.
There was no room to move.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.000
That's kind of when it hit me, like,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.840
"OK, maybe this is not a drill."

15:01.520 --> 15:05.440
There was an announcement made
to lower the window shades.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.160
People outside couldn't see in,
we couldn't see out.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.000
We were sealed off.

15:17.960 --> 15:23.800
That sort of discomfort with extreme
fear, it really gets to you.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.760
I just wanted to get up and scream.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.200
The gentle, plinky-plonky music
that they used to play

15:36.200 --> 15:39.640
before they took off
was on this endless loop.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.880
The Entertainer

15:43.880 --> 15:46.880
playing again and again and again.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.600
It just played all day.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.680
Again and again and again.

15:53.680 --> 15:57.400
Don't look at me!

16:02.320 --> 16:04.160
'Now you know.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.320
Pan Am will bring you
the world's first 747.'

16:09.320 --> 16:13.080
I did 30 years
with Pan American World Airways...

16:14.080 --> 16:18.600
...working on Boeing 707, 747,

16:18.600 --> 16:23.360
whether it was electrical,
radio, mechanical, you name it,

16:23.360 --> 16:25.720
physically working on the airplane.

16:27.160 --> 16:32.080
In 1982, I was made the head
of Pan American for Pakistan

16:32.080 --> 16:34.560
and Iran and Afghanistan.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.120
On that particular day,
I was at home.

16:42.120 --> 16:46.040
They woke me up.
I immediately went to the airport.

16:47.760 --> 16:52.440
I must have arrived half an hour
after the incident had taken place.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.440
Nobody knew at that time that they
were hijackers or what they want.

17:01.960 --> 17:07.359
The door opened and one
of the crew members... called out...

17:07.359 --> 17:10.640
Please come and talk to us.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.319
And there was nothing coming from
any of the government officials

17:15.319 --> 17:17.480
to say what we should do.

17:17.480 --> 17:20.040
It was their responsibility.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.599
It's not for me to do that.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.720
The main hijacker,
he wasn't willing to...

17:28.720 --> 17:33.160
to speak over the megaphone,
and I would speak on the megaphone.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.000
Please, come and talk to us.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.560
I thought, "If I don't go out there

17:41.560 --> 17:44.240
and if this guys keeps calling out,

17:44.240 --> 17:46.800
he may do something drastic...

17:47.880 --> 17:50.320
...because no-one was coming
in front of him."

17:52.160 --> 17:54.040
Please, somebody.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.120
So I said, "I have to go out
and speak to them."

18:03.760 --> 18:06.880
They didn't say, "Don't do it,"
or anything like that.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.400
They said, "Thank you very much."

18:11.480 --> 18:14.760
He says where is the crew
to fly the plane?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.200
I was terrified.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.840
I, too, wanted the captain back.

18:21.840 --> 18:24.520
I have no idea
where the crew have gone.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.320
All I know is that they've got off
the plane and gone somewhere.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.400
I was lying, of course.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.480
I was not going to tell him
that they were in my office.

18:39.480 --> 18:42.040
The whole idea was to buy time.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.360
Because what we would do next
would depend upon

18:45.360 --> 18:47.480
what the government of Pakistan decided.

18:50.840 --> 18:54.320
When I went back, they wanted to
know, "Who was he? What did he..."

18:54.320 --> 18:58.520
And I told them that it appears he's
from some Middle Eastern country.

19:00.720 --> 19:03.840
The government official
instructed police

19:03.840 --> 19:07.080
to go to every hotel in Karachi.

19:08.240 --> 19:12.160
We had to find the passport
the passenger has to give

19:12.160 --> 19:14.760
when he checks into the hotel.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.640
Thank God they stayed
in the Taj Mahal Hotel

19:17.640 --> 19:19.840
on the main airport road.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.160
To work it out was easy because
they had all checked in together

19:24.160 --> 19:28.160
and they all had the same
type of passport with them.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.680
They were Palestinians.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.000
We just got word
from the Associated Press

19:33.000 --> 19:36.240
of a hijacking tonight
in Karachi, Pakistan.

19:36.240 --> 19:39.520
A Pan Am 747, flight 73,

19:39.520 --> 19:41.840
with 390 passenger on board.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.800
We've just received
satellite pictures

19:43.800 --> 19:46.400
of the scene at Karachi Airport,
where hijackers are holding

19:46.400 --> 19:50.120
a Pan Am jumbo jet
with nearly 400 people aboard.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.760
There is Karachi Airport
in Pakistan.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.480
There is the aircraft.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.440
They came back
with photocopies of the passport

20:01.440 --> 20:03.920
and I said,
"Yes, this is the gentleman."

20:05.280 --> 20:07.440
His name was Safarini.

20:33.560 --> 20:37.280
Palestinian guerrillas insist
that their acts of violence

20:37.280 --> 20:40.480
are the only way they can bring
world attention to their cause.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.840
Abu Nidal is the most dangerous
terrorist in the world at present

21:02.840 --> 21:05.360
and his group is in many ways
the most reckless and dangerous

21:05.360 --> 21:08.800
of all the Palestinian groups.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.960
Rome Airport,
just days after Christmas.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.080
The nightmare voyage of the
hijacked cruise ship Achille Lauro.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.840
TWA flight 847, with 39 Americans,
taken hostage for 17 days.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.800
Terrorists are not guerrillas

21:23.800 --> 21:26.680
or freedom fighters
or anything else.

21:26.680 --> 21:31.920
They are terrorists and they should
be identified as such.

21:53.240 --> 21:57.120
â™ª Home of the brave â™ª

22:06.960 --> 22:10.920
Safarini wanted to find out
if they were on the news.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.800
Hijacking was something
that happened.

22:26.400 --> 22:31.040
I knew that this might well be
the Westerners' problem.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.080
There was a Pakistani man
and his daughter sitting

22:36.080 --> 22:38.240
just beside me on the floor.

22:41.640 --> 22:45.960
They were probably looking at me
thinking, "He's in front of us."

22:48.880 --> 22:52.000
I was sitting next to
a middle-aged man and his wife.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.440
I just whispered to the man,
"Where are you from?"

22:57.440 --> 23:00.480
And he muttered back,
"North America."

23:04.640 --> 23:08.040
It's not something that I'm proud of,
to think that, you know,

23:08.040 --> 23:10.080
I would prefer the Americans
to be in front of me,

23:10.080 --> 23:14.280
but... when it comes down to it,
that's what you do.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.240
You work out the odds.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.240
On the second time
when I went spoke to him,

23:24.240 --> 23:28.160
his demand was better communication.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.240
OK!

23:30.240 --> 23:33.400
He was not that good in English.
He was asking the girl

23:33.400 --> 23:35.560
what was I saying. And I said,

23:35.560 --> 23:39.840
"Would it be alright if I stand on
top of the stair and speak to you?"

23:39.840 --> 23:41.040
No!

23:45.120 --> 23:48.200
I'll give you a walkie-talkie.
No!

23:48.200 --> 23:54.280
He was angry and he said he wanted
to fly to Larnaca, Cyprus.

23:54.280 --> 23:58.360
And he said
there were a lot of their friends

23:58.360 --> 24:02.040
who were incarcerated in Larnaca.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.120
And they want to go there
to get them released.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.520
And he said, "Where is the crew?

24:07.520 --> 24:10.000
I want the crew to come back
to fly the plane out."

24:10.000 --> 24:13.640
I asked him, "Would you consider
letting the women and children go?"

24:13.640 --> 24:15.320
No!

24:16.760 --> 24:18.880
And he closed the door.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.840
The Pakistani officials' approach
was,

24:28.840 --> 24:33.040
"Let's get the crew back
and let's fly the aeroplane out."

24:33.040 --> 24:36.720
They felt that if anything happens
to the aircraft

24:36.720 --> 24:41.320
on the Pakistan soil, the Americans
are going to get upset.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.800
I was told by the officials
that if need be,

24:46.800 --> 24:50.480
they would get a volunteer crew
who would fly the plane out.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.400
And I said,
"I have the responsibility

24:53.400 --> 24:55.680
of 300 people on that plane.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.480
Now the plane is on the ground
and we can negotiate,

24:58.480 --> 25:00.720
we can talk and solve the problem.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.840
But once up in the air,
nobody has control over that plane."

25:16.760 --> 25:21.280
Safarini kept trying to see
if he was on the news.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.200
But there wasn't anything.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.840
And the first person in the aisle he
just grabbed and brought up front.

25:31.280 --> 25:35.160
Medium height.
Looks like somebody from India.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.200
And they were taking him.

25:47.240 --> 25:50.880
Safarini said,
"If you don't get the pilots,

25:50.880 --> 25:52.960
I'm going to shoot him."

26:03.720 --> 26:07.680
He was so terrified
and he looked to me to...

26:07.680 --> 26:09.880
to support him, to comfort him.

26:13.720 --> 26:18.480
I said to him, "Don't worry.
I'm here. Nothing's gonna happen."

26:21.200 --> 26:24.440
He asked him, "Why are you crying?
Are you a man?"

26:26.800 --> 26:30.320
He was just... It was sad to see.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.400
He did tell me that he was travelling
with his elderly grandmother.

26:37.720 --> 26:42.480
And asked if I would look after her
should anything happen to him.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.360
I assured him I would.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.920
I said, "If you shoot him,

26:58.920 --> 27:02.720
it'll be very difficult to convince
the government of Pakistan

27:02.720 --> 27:05.760
to find somebody
to fly the plane out."

27:07.760 --> 27:12.160
"Give me 20 minutes, I'll go back
to the officials, talk to them,

27:12.160 --> 27:14.280
and then maybe
we can sort this out."

27:15.520 --> 27:18.000
And he said, "OK."
OK!

27:37.400 --> 27:39.440
He shot him in the head.

27:41.840 --> 27:46.680
And this young man fell.
He slumped at my feet.

27:49.120 --> 27:51.160
And then...

27:51.160 --> 27:54.840
Safarini kicked his body out.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.640
And that was the turning point.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.960
Because he also said,

28:13.960 --> 28:18.040
"Every 20 minutes, I'll bring
one passenger and shoot them."

28:19.040 --> 28:21.280
Now the situation
was totally different.

28:24.360 --> 28:28.680
Someone said, "They killed someone.
Someone got shot."

28:30.000 --> 28:34.160
I don't remember hearing a shot,
but the fact that

28:34.160 --> 28:38.920
they were starting to kill people
made me really nervous.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.880
"What did I do wrong?"
was the biggest thought.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.920
Like, "Oh, my God, how did I
get myself in this situation?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.120
Why did I tell my mom
I wanted to go to India?"

28:54.360 --> 28:57.040
Sitting in that seat, I felt...

28:58.680 --> 29:04.840
...very frightened, and I felt I had
to try to get control of myself.

29:04.840 --> 29:09.320
Safarini was... furious.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.440
"They made me do it.
They made me do it.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.480
I did not want to do it.
They made me do it."

29:14.480 --> 29:18.920
He was talking about the Americans
and the Israelis.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.800
Safarini told me
to collect passports.

30:06.960 --> 30:11.000
He wanted white Americans
or Israeli.

30:17.840 --> 30:21.640
I took my British passport
out of my pocket.

30:21.640 --> 30:26.040
I thought this was a Pan Am plane
and it would be full of Americans.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.920
If they were white Americans,

30:44.920 --> 30:48.480
I just dropped their passports
into their laps.

30:48.480 --> 30:52.640
I managed to drop
quite a few that way.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.960
I heard, "Sunshine, come up front.
Come back, come back."

31:05.320 --> 31:07.200
Give me American passport.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.600
I wanted to try
and hide the passports.

31:16.920 --> 31:20.880
I knew there was a risk.
I knew the way he was standing,

31:20.880 --> 31:23.480
he could turn at the wrong moment
and see me,

31:23.480 --> 31:28.000
but... I was trying to keep
the passengers from...

31:29.280 --> 31:31.560
...being killed.

31:32.680 --> 31:35.280
And I hid them under the seat.

31:39.280 --> 31:43.080
I said,
"These are all Indian Americas,

31:43.080 --> 31:45.480
so there's no white Americans
on board."

31:53.240 --> 31:56.280
He said, "Who are these white people
on the plane?"

31:58.160 --> 32:01.440
We explained to him that
they were different nationalities.

32:01.440 --> 32:05.560
You know, some were British,
some Italian, there were Canadians.

32:06.920 --> 32:09.000
His frustration was building up

32:09.000 --> 32:10.960
because they've come into
an aircraft

32:10.960 --> 32:12.880
which doesn't have American crew,

32:12.880 --> 32:15.640
doesn't have enough American passengers,

32:15.640 --> 32:18.280
the cockpit crew who were there left.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.920
He didn't know what to do now.

32:22.920 --> 32:25.680
There's no Americans. Now what?

32:30.080 --> 32:32.400
"Can Michael John Thexton

32:32.400 --> 32:34.760
please make his way
to the front of the plane."

32:34.760 --> 32:38.480
I think I was... numb
hearing my name.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.960
I was trying to convince myself that
there was some innocent explanation

32:48.960 --> 32:51.200
and maybe they were gonna
let me off the plane.

32:51.200 --> 32:55.000
Erm... but...
I kept coming back to the fact

32:55.000 --> 32:58.360
that surely they were picking me out
to shoot me.

32:58.360 --> 33:03.960
And it is not really possible
to describe in words how that feels.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.880
The State Department in Washington
is following closely

33:28.880 --> 33:31.440
the takeover
of a Pan American jumbo jet.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.760
Four Arabic-speaking gunmen
demanded to be flown to Cyprus.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.400
The hijackers,
dressed as security guards,

33:37.400 --> 33:40.800
took over the airliner shortly after
it stopped over at Karachi.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.200
They're known to have
automatic weapons with them

33:43.200 --> 33:46.040
and have already shot one passenger
through the head.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.480
I felt... absolutely desperate.

34:20.159 --> 34:24.280
And I said, "My parents have
no-one else. Please don't hurt me."

34:26.520 --> 34:30.880
And I tried to say something
about my brother's death.

34:31.920 --> 34:35.320
But he just waved a hand as if to
say, "I haven't got time for that."

34:38.600 --> 34:40.840
Peter was six years older than me.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.920
He was the one
who did the exciting things.

34:47.880 --> 34:51.880
He was the doctor
on an expedition to K2

34:51.880 --> 34:55.239
in 1983

34:55.239 --> 34:58.480
and he died of altitude sickness.

35:03.160 --> 35:07.160
In 1986, I'd taken the summer off
to go on a mountaineering expedition

35:07.160 --> 35:09.280
to the Karakoram Himalaya.

35:09.280 --> 35:14.240
I wanted to... I wanted to see
where he died and say goodbye.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.920
I was absolutely convinced
that I was gonna die.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.920
The main thing I thought about
in that moment

35:30.920 --> 35:34.360
was how sorry I was for my parents.

35:35.640 --> 35:39.280
I thought about...
what they had gone through,

35:39.280 --> 35:41.560
what we had all gone through,
when my brother died.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.560
I just felt so sad

35:45.560 --> 35:48.760
that they had lost my elder brother

35:48.760 --> 35:51.400
and now they were gonna lose me,
as well.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.960
I whispered
to one of the flight attendants,

35:58.960 --> 36:03.000
"Please tell my family
that I love them very much."

36:25.120 --> 36:27.440
He got me to open the door.

36:28.840 --> 36:33.360
Safarini stood one of the flight
attendants in that crack of daylight

36:33.360 --> 36:37.600
and she was speaking on a megaphone

36:37.600 --> 36:40.120
to somebody who was under the plane.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.720
OK!

36:42.720 --> 36:48.440
Safarini used Mike Thexton
as a prod to Viraf.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.320
He told me to tell you that...

36:51.320 --> 36:55.080
You don't get the pilots,
I'm going to shoot... Him.

37:00.560 --> 37:03.240
I thought that Safarini
would shoot me

37:03.240 --> 37:05.440
and I'm just waiting
for that to happen.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.640
At that point, I think I made

37:12.640 --> 37:15.440
one of the toughest decisions
of my life.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.760
I had no choice.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.480
There is a staff member of mine
on the aeroplane.

37:24.640 --> 37:28.040
I told him about one of my staff,

37:28.040 --> 37:33.040
Meherjee Kharas,
an aircraft maintenance man,

37:33.040 --> 37:36.440
trapped inside
when the hijackers took the plane,

37:36.440 --> 37:40.000
who will work the cockpit
radio communication.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.640
At least now he will be appeased

37:43.640 --> 37:45.920
with better communication,
which he wanted,

37:45.920 --> 37:49.640
and he would calm down
and not shoot anybody else.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.560
Move.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.720
Hello?

38:01.720 --> 38:05.440
Flight 73.
Flight 73, I can hear you.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.240
The way it was set up was

38:09.240 --> 38:12.480
they would call
the operations office of Pan Am.

38:12.480 --> 38:15.440
"Pan Am flight 73."

38:15.440 --> 38:18.880
Safarini was not fluent in English.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.320
He wanted to speak with somebody
in Arabic.

38:24.480 --> 38:29.000
So eventually, somebody said that,
"OK, we found a gentleman

38:29.000 --> 38:32.720
who used to work
for Saudi Arabian Airlines

38:32.720 --> 38:35.320
in their catering services."

38:35.320 --> 38:39.680
And we roped him in
to come and speak to him

38:39.680 --> 38:42.800
from the operations office
in Arabic.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.760
The man had never done
anything like this.

39:14.000 --> 39:20.160
By that time, a government official
was already in my operations office.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.960
He was telling him
what to tell the hijackers.

39:24.480 --> 39:29.640
Now I'm not able to speak to him,
I don't know what he's saying.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.760
That was the most defeating thing
for me.

40:12.280 --> 40:15.200
At that point, of course,
we still didn't know

40:15.200 --> 40:18.760
exactly who
these Palestinian people were

40:18.760 --> 40:22.240
because no group had come forward
to claim responsibility.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.720
They started the killing
very early on.

40:26.720 --> 40:30.600
It must mean that they are one of
the professional Middle East gangs.

40:30.600 --> 40:34.000
Possibly the Abu Nidal gang.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.680
Pan Am 73 in September of 1986,
it's not a one-off event.

40:40.720 --> 40:44.560
Libya has a finger in most terrorist
pies in one way or another.

40:45.640 --> 40:50.040
Reagan and Gaddafi
had been confronting each other.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.400
Like hornets in a bottle.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.920
Gaddafi wanted to be the leader

40:55.920 --> 40:59.240
of the radical world
against the West.

40:59.240 --> 41:02.400
This mad dog of the Middle East
has a...

41:02.400 --> 41:05.720
Reagan purposely tried to compare
Gaddafi to a dog,

41:05.720 --> 41:08.040
which in Arab culture
is one of the biggest insults

41:08.040 --> 41:10.400
you can make to a man.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.560
The game kept getting raised
up, up, up and up.

41:13.560 --> 41:16.800
At Vienna Airport, three men
threw four hand grenades,

41:16.800 --> 41:19.240
opened up with Kalashnikov
submachine guns...

41:19.240 --> 41:23.880
Libya was behind the attack
at the Rome and Vienna Airports.

41:23.880 --> 41:26.440
Libya was targeting
US service people.

41:26.440 --> 41:28.480
The wreckage of a night club
in Berlin,

41:28.480 --> 41:30.800
a gathering place
for young American soldiers.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.600
It was proven that Libya was behind

41:32.600 --> 41:35.600
the La Belle Disco bombing
in West Berlin in '86.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.600
President Reagan decided
he had to make a statement.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.760
And kill Gaddafi.

41:44.640 --> 41:48.280
Fellow Americans,
at seven o'clock this evening...

41:49.280 --> 41:52.040
...air and naval forces
launched a series of strikes

41:52.040 --> 41:53.960
against Muammar Gaddafi.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.920
By golly, we were gonna show

41:55.920 --> 41:58.880
the mad dog of the Middle East
America's back.

41:58.880 --> 42:02.080
But the raid on Tripoli
was a failure.

42:02.080 --> 42:04.840
And if you're gonna go after
the king,

42:04.840 --> 42:07.000
you better kill him.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.360
Gaddafi realised this was personal.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.960
It was time for payback.

42:14.960 --> 42:18.120
But it was a lot easier
to contract out the terror.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.720
By having one step removed, there's
fewer fingerprints, less DNA.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.640
I'll give him X million dollars,

42:53.640 --> 42:57.200
and Abu Nidal, who himself
never went on these missions,

42:57.200 --> 43:00.520
but he would recruit young believers
to carry it out.

43:01.960 --> 43:05.440
Pan Am was the flagship US carrier.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.720
Five months after
the raid on Gaddafi,

43:10.720 --> 43:14.080
the attack on Pan Am 73 occurred
in Karachi, Pakistan.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.640
At some point in the day,
they were going to make a demand,

43:34.640 --> 43:38.360
it wasn't going to be met,
and they would shoot me.

43:43.960 --> 43:46.440
I had this really strong thought

43:46.440 --> 43:50.040
that you shouldn't let
the sun go down on your anger.

43:53.080 --> 43:55.520
And I would offer
to shake Safarini's hand

43:55.520 --> 43:57.400
if he came down
and said he was gonna shoot me.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.120
I knew how a British gentleman
was supposed to behave

44:02.120 --> 44:04.120
in this sort of extremity.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.480
It was probably nonsense,

44:07.480 --> 44:11.440
but... I found it comforting
in that moment.

44:14.720 --> 44:18.080
It's very important to make sure
that the hijackers are calm

44:18.080 --> 44:21.360
and they have trust in you.
I believe that we have established

44:21.360 --> 44:24.920
that kind of rapport.
The situation remains the same.

44:24.920 --> 44:29.880
They are wanting the American crew
to come and take them away.

44:31.120 --> 44:35.440
The official of the government who
was sitting in the Pan Am office,

44:35.440 --> 44:39.400
he was getting instructions
from the government of Pakistan.

44:40.440 --> 44:44.040
My fear was, "How long will we
just communicate with them

44:44.040 --> 44:47.400
without knowing what is
the next thing we want to do?"

44:49.560 --> 44:53.080
So I went to see the state governor,

44:53.080 --> 44:55.280
who was at the airport.

44:55.280 --> 44:58.600
I went to ask him to tell me
what is plan B?

44:59.600 --> 45:03.040
I was told, "I'm sorry, you can't
speak to the governor just now.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.080
He's having his lunch."

45:05.080 --> 45:07.200
Without thinking, I just said,

45:07.200 --> 45:10.840
"300 people's lives are at stake
and he's having his lunch?"

45:14.560 --> 45:19.200
Right in the tail of the aeroplane
is the aircraft power unit.

45:20.880 --> 45:24.800
And that unit
supplies electrical power

45:24.800 --> 45:28.160
and air-conditioning power
for the aircraft

45:28.160 --> 45:30.200
whilst it is on the ground.

45:31.200 --> 45:36.280
The APU is designed to run
for maybe two hours, three hours.

45:36.280 --> 45:40.560
It's not designed to run
for 15 hours or 16 hours.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.200
If the APU fails,

45:44.200 --> 45:46.440
the aeroplane
will just heat up quickly

45:46.440 --> 45:51.480
and it will be stiflingly hot inside
with people unable to breathe.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.560
And there'll be no radio contact.

45:55.560 --> 45:58.080
No communication. Nothing.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.880
I spoke with a government official.

46:02.880 --> 46:06.320
I said, "We need to have
a ground power unit connected

46:06.320 --> 46:09.880
just in case the aircraft power unit
shuts down."

46:09.880 --> 46:14.200
And he said, "I don't want
any piece of equipment

46:14.200 --> 46:17.120
or vehicle near the plane."

46:25.400 --> 46:28.880
And I have this late piece of copy
that has just been handed to me.

46:28.880 --> 46:31.360
Pakistani officials
are saying that the hijackers

46:31.360 --> 46:34.480
have offered to release
the Pan Am jet's passengers

46:34.480 --> 46:39.560
if a flight crew is brought on board
and they are flown to Cyprus.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.920
They communicated to him

47:03.920 --> 47:06.240
that Pan Am had arranged
for a volunteer crew

47:06.240 --> 47:10.360
which was on its way from Germany,
but it would take time.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.480
By the afternoon,

48:15.480 --> 48:18.320
press people found out
that we were in the operations room.

48:18.320 --> 48:20.440
They were trying to get
into the office.

48:22.080 --> 48:26.800
Phone lines were inundated,
non-stop, with people.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.960
They had loved ones on the plane.

48:36.040 --> 48:39.280
I was in graduate school in Seattle
at that time.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.360
It was very early hours
of the morning.

48:45.240 --> 48:48.080
My brother called me from Texas.

48:49.080 --> 48:51.600
And he said,
"It appears that Pan Am's plane

48:51.600 --> 48:53.840
has been hijacked in Karachi."

48:54.880 --> 48:57.160
My parents were coming here
for a wedding

48:57.160 --> 49:00.480
and the first trip
out of the country for both of them

49:00.480 --> 49:02.400
was Pan Am flight 73.

49:02.400 --> 49:05.160
They had never been outside
the country, either one of them.

49:08.600 --> 49:12.080
The first reaction
is just pure disbelief.

49:12.080 --> 49:15.520
And then there is this...

49:16.520 --> 49:18.480
...absolute feeling of terror.

49:22.080 --> 49:26.640
400 passengers and cabin attendants
are being held at this hour.

49:26.640 --> 49:30.560
The hijackers have shot
one passenger, it seems,

49:30.560 --> 49:33.600
through the head
and threw him off the aircraft.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.880
Passengers were boarding
for a flight to New York,

49:35.880 --> 49:39.160
but the cockpit crew escaped
just before the takeover.

49:39.160 --> 49:42.000
Isn't this a dereliction of duty?
Absolutely not.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.840
The commander of the plane did
exactly what we expected him to do.

49:44.840 --> 49:48.600
It is long... Let me finish!
It's long-standing Pan Am...

49:48.600 --> 49:51.520
Everybody was calling me.
"Have you heard anything more?"

49:51.520 --> 49:55.600
The hijackers demanded a new flight
crew be brought to the plane

49:55.600 --> 49:57.760
in exchange
for some of the passengers.

49:57.760 --> 50:01.480
And they promise that as soon
as the crew is provided to them,

50:01.480 --> 50:04.200
that they will release
the passengers.

50:05.200 --> 50:08.560
All these horrific scenes
going through your mind

50:08.560 --> 50:12.120
is absolutely terrorising.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.640
My parents were on that plane.

50:34.360 --> 50:37.400
After... Many, many hours...
I think seven, eight hours,

50:37.400 --> 50:39.160
they were easing off, you know.

50:40.720 --> 50:42.720
They calmed down.

50:50.840 --> 50:55.160
For a long time,
we didn't have any food or drinks.

50:55.160 --> 50:58.240
We were well into many hours.

51:03.440 --> 51:05.840
Do you want a drink?

51:05.840 --> 51:08.400
Beer? Whisky?

51:09.480 --> 51:11.640
Er, a glass of water would be nice.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.280
Get him a drink.

51:19.760 --> 51:22.840
Eventually,
I remember them passing out

51:22.840 --> 51:25.480
I think they were
cucumber and chutney sandwiches

51:25.480 --> 51:28.280
or something of that sort.

51:33.760 --> 51:35.840
It got monotonous.

51:43.640 --> 51:47.560
Your mind kind of focuses
on different things.

51:48.880 --> 51:51.640
Like, "Wow, why do they keep
playing this song?

51:51.640 --> 51:53.400
There has to be another song."

51:55.840 --> 51:58.080
I kind of shut down a little bit.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.760
But eventually,

52:05.760 --> 52:10.240
I heard this kid next to me
who was upset.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.400
I wanted to make him feel better.

52:18.280 --> 52:21.160
And playing with him
made me feel better.

52:23.920 --> 52:28.920
A moment of happiness
in this really tense situation.

52:30.760 --> 52:34.960
That little kid really helped me.

52:36.120 --> 52:37.560
Yeah.

52:49.160 --> 52:52.880
I was very scared, deep inside,

52:52.880 --> 52:55.800
but, you know,
I was trying to look calm.

52:57.160 --> 53:00.320
And trying to do
her elder sister's duty.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.040
And that situation,

53:08.040 --> 53:11.520
it was so tiring, so boring.

53:14.720 --> 53:19.640
And my brother, Imran,
started to get angry.

53:19.640 --> 53:24.240
He was planning just to take the gun
from the young guy.

53:28.600 --> 53:33.120
My brother was six feet tall
and he was a sportsman.

53:33.120 --> 53:38.840
He was an athlete and he had all the
qualities of an athlete, you know?

53:40.000 --> 53:43.600
He said, "Let's go from this side,
I'll go from that side,

53:43.600 --> 53:45.520
and we take the gun.

53:47.840 --> 53:50.320
They're gonna kill us anyway.

53:50.320 --> 53:53.920
Why are they all
sitting like ducks?"

53:53.920 --> 53:57.920
And I still don't know
why people in that situation,

53:57.920 --> 54:01.880
they just sit and don't do nothing.
Because they have guns.

54:01.880 --> 54:05.520
Yeah, so maybe three people
be will be dead, four.

54:12.440 --> 54:15.240
I was scared to lose him, you know?

54:15.240 --> 54:18.520
I did not want my little brother dead.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.960
So I was telling him to calm down.

54:27.200 --> 54:29.600
Just hold on.

54:36.600 --> 54:41.040
There was one point where
Safarini sat down opposite me.

54:42.840 --> 54:45.120
Are you married?

54:47.360 --> 54:48.920
I have a girlfriend.

54:50.480 --> 54:53.720
And he just said,
"I'm sorry about this.

54:53.720 --> 54:56.040
I don't like this fighting,
this killing.

54:56.040 --> 54:59.520
I would like to go out dancing,
go out drinking, go out with women.

55:00.520 --> 55:03.320
But the Americans and Israelis
have stolen my country,

55:03.320 --> 55:06.400
and without my country,
these things are no good."

55:29.360 --> 55:32.600
I wouldn't in any way
condone what he was doing.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.800
But I remember feeling...

55:37.800 --> 55:42.720
...sorry for him. He thought that
terrorism would do some good.

55:42.720 --> 55:46.720
And yet it would only increase
all of the anger and suffering.

55:46.720 --> 55:49.240
I just felt that
that was terribly sad.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.560
But as time went on,

55:59.560 --> 56:03.520
somehow I was beginning
to have some hope

56:03.520 --> 56:07.160
that it would all resolve itself peacefully.

56:13.960 --> 56:17.000
Safarini seemed to be
in control of the situation.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.520
He didn't seem worried.

56:22.080 --> 56:27.440
He said, "The captain's coming back
and we're gonna fly to Cyprus.

56:27.440 --> 56:31.000
But where do you all wanna go?"
He was actually joking with us.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.120
And he named Bangkok.

56:33.120 --> 56:35.440
"Cos I can take you all anywhere."

56:37.000 --> 56:41.160
He said, "It's my 24th birthday."

56:43.480 --> 56:47.760
And he asked for me to open
a bottle of champagne.

56:48.760 --> 56:50.480
Cheers.

56:50.480 --> 56:53.280
Champagne is normally
for good times.

56:54.440 --> 56:57.560
But I felt I had to drink with him.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.080
He started flirting.

57:02.400 --> 57:07.760
He asked me if I would go to the
disco with him if he came to Mumbai.

57:13.760 --> 57:16.920
I saw a belt around his waist.

57:18.400 --> 57:22.040
I asked what that was and he said,

57:22.040 --> 57:26.000
"This has been given to me
by my mother to prevent pain."

57:30.920 --> 57:35.520
It definitely looked like
it contained enough explosives

57:35.520 --> 57:39.200
to blow up the entire plane.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.560
That was the most stressful drink
of my life.

58:05.080 --> 58:08.400
- What is this?
- It's OK!

58:08.400 --> 58:11.680
Suddenly,
there was a loud, jarring sound.

58:11.680 --> 58:14.120
Go! Go!
OK.

58:14.120 --> 58:19.160
I told him, "It's OK. It's just
someone in the toilet smoking."

58:24.920 --> 58:28.120
Safarini's mood got a lot worse.

58:28.120 --> 58:30.320
He took me into the cockpit.

58:30.320 --> 58:31.360
Soldier.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.200
Soldier.

58:34.200 --> 58:37.920
He was afraid of snipers outside.

58:42.800 --> 58:45.760
Good morning. Pan American flight 73,

58:45.760 --> 58:50.560
hijacked about 12 hours ago by four
gunmen, is still on the ground...

58:50.560 --> 58:54.600
Back to the hijack, and Pan Am in
London has issued a telephone number

58:54.600 --> 58:57.520
for anyone concerned about
passengers on the Karachi jet.

59:19.400 --> 59:22.640
I suggested we listen to his demand

59:22.640 --> 59:26.920
and put lights all around the plane
so that they'd know

59:26.920 --> 59:31.480
there is no untoward incident
planned to try and storm the plane.

59:33.360 --> 59:36.080
The officials wouldn't listen.

59:42.120 --> 59:44.440
At this point,
I think he believed that

59:44.440 --> 59:46.960
perhaps the negotiators
are stalling.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.040
Safarini was upset.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.920
"Clipper 73."

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:14.440
When the cockpit radio came on...

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.320
"Clipper 73, come in, please."

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.280
...he told me, "Ignore it."

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.280
Clipper 73, come in, please.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.080
At that point, I knew...
Come in, please.

01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.080
...that time was running out.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.440
After running for 15 hours or so...

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.320
...the power unit finally shut down.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.000
Move! What is this?

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.600
Kharas explained
the power had failed

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.760
and that the emergency lighting

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.400
would not last for longer
than 15 minutes,

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:32.720
after which it would not be possible
to restore the lights at all

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.600
and there would be no power
for the plane to take off.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.680
There was a very bright light

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.840
right above
the first officer's seat.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.600
Cover! Cover the light!

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:48.040
And Safarini believed
that people from the outside

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.840
could see very clearly
into the cockpit.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.400
Clipper 73.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.280
They said, "The aircraft is not
responding when we are calling out.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:01.000
Maybe the APU has failed,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.680
which means there is no way
to talk to the hijackers."

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.240
I said, "I've got to take a look."

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:09.440
Out!

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.680
Wake up!

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.600
Move!

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.600
The music had stopped, the hiss
of the air-conditioning had stopped,

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.760
and the lights were definitely
dimmer. And it was getting hotter.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:30.360
Hey.

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.720
Move it! Up, up!

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.560
Jamal shook me awake,
- kept pushing me.
- Go!

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.520
Sit down! And everyone be quiet!

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.280
Get up. Get back.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.640
Safarini saw me right in front
and he told me to go behind,

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.840
so I climbed over two people,

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:52.200
and he made me go further behind.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.440
I said, "Is this OK?"
And he says, "Yes, sit."

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.000
I saw a window seat this time

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.200
and I thought,
"I'm back with the others.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.880
I stand the same chance as anybody.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.840
This is unbelievable."

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.920
I sat down on the floor
with Kharas seated in front of me.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.800
It became challenging to even take
a nice, fresh breath of air.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.000
And I just wanted
to get out of there.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.360
I remember the lights flickering.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.520
And then all of a sudden,
they shut off.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.240
You, up.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.600
Safarini said,
"Make an announcement.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.960
I am trying to restore the lights."

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.760
Please stay quiet and do not move.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.240
Sit.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:09.840
When I got there,
the airplane was in total darkness.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:15.880
I said,
"Let's put the tarmac lights on

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.320
so they know that
there's nothing happening."

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.080
He said, "There is no switches. We
cut the wire to put the lights off."

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:34.880
An older lady leaned forward to me
and very quietly said...

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.600
..."They're going to kill us now,
aren't they?"

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.320
I patted her arm and I said,

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.720
"No, no. It's going to be alright."

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.200
Everybody was bracing themselves

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.560
for whatever it was
that was going to happen.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:07.400
And I got as low in the seat
as I could get.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:09.520
I prayed.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.760
I prayed continuously.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:16.280
My brother, he told me,

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:20.200
"Just pray to God
and remember our parents.

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.400
This is it. We are gonna die."

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.320
I needed to convince Safarini

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.440
that we are doing everything
possible to get the power on again.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.480
I instinctively... dropped

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.520
in between my seat
and the seat in front of me.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.760
Cos... I didn't know
what was happening.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.440
And I felt gun shells
hitting my arm.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.920
I looked up and that's when I saw

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.040
that the hijacker was shooting...

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.640
everywhere, aimlessly.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.800
The passengers were howling.

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:32.880
It was like mass howling.
It was unearthly.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.160
The young hijacker...

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:41.040
..I saw him
throwing the hand grenade on us.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.240
And the hand grenades
they threw on our feet.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.040
My brother,
he was sitting next to me.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.680
My leg and his leg,
we were all, like, you know,

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.800
blown up with the hand grenade.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.160
And... I thought I'm dead.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.120
I thought,

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.960
"This it is.
I don't think I'm gonna make it."

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.680
I looked down and I saw my, erm...

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.200
...co-worker, the Pan Am
maintenance man, Kharas...

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.520
...was no more.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.520
Someone started climbing over me

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.200
to get into the aisle.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:33.640
So I reached for the little boy
who I was playing with.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:37.360
As I reached out for him,
I just saw him laying there,

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.160
like he was sleeping.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.440
I just blocked him out of my mind.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.680
And I just kept going.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.720
I feel, erm... guilty.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.560
Like, "Why did I live
and he didn't?"

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.320
The hijackers
began throwing hand grenades

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.200
and firing into the helpless people
huddled together.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.800
When I opened my eyes,
I was alive and in so much pain.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:23.600
You can imagine, if a hand grenade
blew up on your feet.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.640
And then I try to get up from
my seat... Where was I at that time?

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.800
You were on the seat.
All of you were, like, fainted.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:36.600
When the firing stopped,
there were cries of pain

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.240
that could be heard
throughout the cabin.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.160
People started getting up
and running towards the doors.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.720
I just remember everyone

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:49.279
just crowding around the door,
trying to get it open.

01:08:49.279 --> 01:08:53.439
Somebody, I don't know who,
emergency open

01:08:53.439 --> 01:08:55.880
and the people jump out.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:00.319
So I drag her
and throw her from the chute.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.960
It was easy for me
because she was petite and young.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.200
And my brother was six feet tall.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.680
It was not easy to drag him,

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.800
but I didn't give up.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:16.240
Love make you very strong.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.800
We got out as fast as we could,

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.439
either down the chutes or onto
the wing and jumping off the edge

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:24.120
and then...

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:29.279
I saw a gentleman leapt off the wing
and he fell

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:33.840
and I hear him screaming really loud
as he hit the ground.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.680
When I was on the wing, I saw...

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.920
...two of the hijackers

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.520
jump off into the slide,

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.080
along with the passengers.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.680
They threw all their weapons
to try and escape as a passenger.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.640
I took my two kids
and I hid them under the chair.

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:01.240
And then I could see
their legs and hands,

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.480
so I didn't want them to get hurt
on their legs and hands,

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.400
so I laid myself on top of...

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:13.680
In the terminal building,
it was just chaos.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.000
They took me to a hall area, which...

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.400
which... was just benches laid out

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.800
and bodies on it covered,

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.360
and they pulled back every sheet

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.320
to see if any of them
was a hijacker.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.400
And none of them were.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.800
Two of the terrorists
tried to escape.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.000
They were set upon and beaten
by passengers on the ground

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.920
before being taken into custody
by Pakistani police.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.920
They said
they had caught some people.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:48.920
And they take me to this truck...

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.360
...with these three guys.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.960
And they made them stand up,
look at me, and I identified them.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.360
Then they took me to identify
the fourth guy.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.680
Safarini was in hospital,
where they wheeled him out.

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.280
Safarini was injured.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.520
Shot by one of his own men.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.920
At the hospital,
it was a scene of complete chaos.

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.040
Doctors and nurses
were dealing with patients

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:29.520
on the floor and on beds.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.200
When they were trying to take out
the shrapnel from my back,

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.160
I had cardiac arrest and they
announced me clinically dead.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:45.000
I saw a flight attendant, Neerja,
on the floor

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.560
and I went to a doctor and I tugged
at his sleeve and I said,

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.800
"Come and help me." And he said,
"Everybody here is a critical case."

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.080
I kept calling Karachi
to get some information.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.400
Eventually, I got a call

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.400
that said, "Your parents are safe."

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.760
After I... got the news,
it was this tremendous relief.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:29.880
I can still remember thinking,
"This is not real.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.360
I'm going to wake up in a minute
and I'll be back on that plane."

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.120
It's one of the biggest medical
evacuations Pakistan has ever seen.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.360
Many still speechless in shock.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.040
Also on the Bombay flight,
the remains of one of the dead,

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.600
as Indian hostess called Neerja,

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.560
her chipboard coffin shuddering up
the conveyer belt into the hold.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.160
She was trying to help two children
to get out

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.120
while the shooting was taking place.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.600
She was trying to get them out
through the door.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.840
And in the process, she got shot.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:25.160
Saturday morning,
my mother called me.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:31.440
She said, very calm...

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.520
...very dignified, and she said...

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.920
..."Your father's life story
has come to an end."

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.040
That was the first thing
out of her mouth.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.280
And I kept saying,
"Where is he? Where is he?"

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.360
And she said, "He is no more."

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.920
She said,
"I don't want you to get upset.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:00.640
It'll hurt me more than
it'll hurt you if you lose it.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.960
You hang in there." And...

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:07.080
I'll take a drink of water.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.920
We keep asking everyone,
"How is Imran? How is Imran?"

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.920
And later on, we find out
that the whole hospital

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.040
was guided not to tell us
that he is no more with us.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.320
Some of the shrapnels
go into his head.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.720
He got heart attack and he died.

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.720
During that time,
I thought he's alive.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:53.120
We went to the Sheraton

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:56.440
where they had a copy
of the local paper.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.400
The headline was something like,

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:02.600
"Daring commando raid
frees hijack passengers."

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.160
Army commandos
approached the aircraft.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.680
The hijackers apparently saw them
and began shooting.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.840
And the commandos stormed the plane.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.080
After hearing gunfire
and explosions,

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.680
Pakistani commandos
stormed the stricken plane,

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.080
firing their weapons.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:23.800
There were no commandos there
to save us.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.400
No, there were no security forces
around the airplane.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.160
I looked when I came out, I looked
under the airplane and on the sides.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.480
There was no Pakistani action
that I know of.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.240
They didn't. That's all a fallacy.
No commandos came on.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.440
They do say that
a lie goes round the world

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.200
before the truth
has got its trousers on.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.720
It turns out
that Pakistani commandos

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.920
were actually storming the plane
at the same time

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.080
the panicked passengers were
rushing through the emergency doors.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.880
Please come here.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.000
Oh, this is the press conference.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.280
How could four hijackers
inside the plane,

01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:07.640
busy shooting at passengers,
hold back your commandos,

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.760
who you'd had all day
to get into place?

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.200
Don't mind it, but I haven't
understood a word from your accent.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.280
Could somebody speak
in a different accent and let me...

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.960
At the point
when the shooting started,

01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.720
the commandos, they were half a mile
away from the aircraft.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.520
So by the time they would... get up

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.880
and pick up their weapons
and get into a bus and come there,

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.080
it was all over.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.480
With me now is Pakistan's
ambassador to London.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.480
There have been criticisms,
largely that it was 25 minutes

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:40.040
before your special guys
actually got on the plane.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.800
I spoke to the Secretary of Defence
and he told me

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.400
that it took them
exactly three minutes

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.800
to reach the plane

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.960
and to save the people.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.680
Ambassador, we must stop there.
Thank you so much for joining us.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:00.120
President Zia was full of praise
for the way his security forces

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.360
handled the hijack crisis.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:06.480
The Pakistani government at the time
saw Pan Am 73 as an embarrassment

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:09.160
that it took place on their watch,
if you will.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:11.960
And they don't like to be embarrassed.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.920
They deal with it by trying to
cover it up and make it go away.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:19.120
I'm very proud of them because I
think the handling was professional,

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.280
it was bravely handled,

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.880
and the result was totally
what we expected.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.800
The FBI turned up in Karachi
and interviewed people.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.400
But General Zia was very firm

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.800
that the Pakistanis
would deal with the hijackers.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.120
We have now a very effective law,

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.720
the punishment of which
is death sentence.

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.760
So I was aware of the trial

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:52.400
and I was aware that
they had been found guilty

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.400
and they were given a death sentence.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:57.760
I just assumed that
that was how it was going to stay.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.520
But after various reductions,
that just came down to being

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:05.600
a 15-year sentence, a very short
time for all those deaths.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.400
Libya today categorically denied

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:12.880
that it was involved in any way
with the Karachi hijacking.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:17.480
Politics, it's a game with rules
that are not written down.

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:21.960
And that's why professional
diplomats and politicians play it.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.240
Administration officials
have been very cautious

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.000
about linking Libya
to the Pan Am hijacking.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.400
Libya and Colonel Gaddafi, we cannot
connect this one at this time.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.040
- Are you gonna look, however?
- Well,
we will always be, er, vigilant

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.280
in our efforts to find out
who commits acts of terrorism,

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.360
to prevent them and...

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.720
Why was the US hesitant to point to
Libya as the culprit in Pan Am 73?

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.000
Optics. Put it this way, I think it
was embarrassing for Ronald Reagan.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.440
You know, trying to kill Gaddafi
in Tripoli

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.720
was a failure.

01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.880
I thought you taught Gaddafi
a lesson,

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.040
but three months later,
he's, you know, doing this stuff.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:09.840
But remember what Pan Am 73
was supposed to be.

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.600
It wasn't supposed to be carnage
on the ground in Karachi, Pakistan.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:17.000
That is not what the terrorists
wanted to do.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.440
They wanted to hijack a jumbo jet
loaded with fuel and passengers,

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.520
crash it into a symbolic target

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.440
in a spectacular suicide mission,
if you will,

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:31.080
and do it in a way that it'll be
broadcast around the world,

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.680
in every newspaper and television
station, for months and years.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.880
Clearly Pan Am 73, in hindsight,

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.680
was a forerunner of the attacks
of September 11.

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:24.080
We've arrested a known terrorist,

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.440
Zaid Hassan Safarini.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.880
He's not affiliated with Al-Qaeda.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.280
Yet he's an example

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.160
of the wider war on terrorism
and what we intend to do.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.840
Safarini?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.960
We got him and today
the United States of America

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.000
will charge him with murder.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.520
We travelled to Washington

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.840
for his hearing.

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.800
They were calling upon
all survivors,

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.280
witnesses,

01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.640
family members, crew,

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.000
to testify in court.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.920
I thought, "I have to see
what happens to him.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.880
He was the man
that was going to shoot me."

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.760
I didn't wanna go.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.400
I didn't want to see his face.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.720
I wanted him to be dead.

01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:46.160
Defendant Safarini
is directly responsible

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.680
for the deaths of 20 people,

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:54.080
the attempted murder
of about 358 other hostages,

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:59.440
and the injury of at least
100 surviving passengers and crew.

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:07.880
It was a shock to see Safarini
in shackles, surrounded by marshals.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.960
He looked very different.

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.360
I thought he looked
a pathetic, broken man.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:25.720
I do remember calling him a murderer

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:29.680
and how he cost the lives
of many people,

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.560
and how he just didn't hurt them,

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.560
he hurt their loved ones
and their family.

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.640
He spoke with a dead voice,

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:39.240
like, "I am sorry
for what happened, blah, blah."

01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:42.600
Like, no remorse at all.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:46.240
I don't think that any apology
that he could've given

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.640
would have remotely satisfied

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.400
the people who were
so angry with him.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:56.280
I'll be very honest, I didn't wish
a death penalty for him,

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.760
simply because that would be
too sweet and too sudden for him.

01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.640
Mr Safarini,
you have pleaded guilty.

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.760
Are you prepared to be sentenced?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.280
The sentence that he was given,

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.920
it almost sounds medieval.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.400
The total agreed-upon sentence...

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.600
...is 160 years in prison.

01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:30.320
I'm disappointed.
I think he deserves worse.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.920
Tell us now what you told the court

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.200
about what you'd like to do
with the defendant.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.360
No, not on camera.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.960
He's gonna live his life
thinking about why he's there.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.840
And I hope he suffers.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:50.040
I got a call
from several family members.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.280
Effectively,
what I do is I pursue claims

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:54.120
against sovereign governments.

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.160
They came to me and said, "We've
read about you, heard about you.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:00.160
Do you think you could take on
our case against Libya for PA73?

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.720
That's what we want. Justice.

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:05.960
We want a judge to say
Libya did it."

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.840
And we were fairly close
to going to trial.

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:15.520
But... there's a bigger diplomatic
stage beyond the courtroom.

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:18.520
Politics will trump justice.

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.960
And after 9/11,
things changed dramatically.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.240
Blair made his trip to the desert
to welcome Muammar Gaddafi

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.360
back in from the cold.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:33.600
Gaddafi had got out
of the terrorism business.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.920
He actually was cooperating
on going after Al-Qaeda.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.400
And he was back on the world stage.
Extraordinary. A mass murderer.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.600
Gaddafi gave up his WMD
and he gave the West what it wanted.

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.320
Clean oil, easy to get,
cheap to transport.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.720
You now have Gaddafi
as a source of intel

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.240
rather than
as the focus of the intel.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.160
In 2008, President Bush and Gaddafi
entered into

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:05.440
a $1.5 billion settlement

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.720
to resolve all pending cases
against Libya.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.000
Pan Am 73 was one of them,

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.680
but only Americans
are included in the settlement.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.000
How about food
and something to drink?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.360
Passengers must have been asking
plenty of questions.

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.800
From the beginning,
there was no panic.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.240
Passengers were calm
and supportive of our efforts.

01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:35.800
We were, as much as it was possible,
in low voices,

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.000
keeping passengers...

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:14.840
They had an awards ceremony
where the hijack crew got a pen.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.240
It has the Pan Am logo on it.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:21.800
A gift for your...
Yeah. For...

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.920
For whatever. Our bravery.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.360
I don't know what it was for.
It was just a gesture.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:33.720
And, erm...
yep, I've kept it all these years.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.040
And this is a letter
from one of the passengers.

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:42.160
"I want you to know
how appreciative I am

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.960
of the courageous action you took

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.640
in hiding the passports
of the American passengers.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.200
My sincere thanks
for your quick thinking and bravery.

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.560
I hope to hear from you soon."

01:26:56.480 --> 01:27:00.600
That's a nice letter.
Yeah, it is. It was... It was nice.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.480
I didn't expect anything like that.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.400
Because everyone was so traumatised,
you know.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:09.000
But it... it was nice of him.

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.240
I get flashbacks of what happened

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.360
and I... think a lot of it
was guilt.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.760
And I think that was the most
difficult thing to carry on with.

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:35.400
Not because I survived,
but because I couldn't do more.

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.240
And these are some letters
that I wrote to and received

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.560
from Zaid Safarini in jail.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.480
In the supermax facility.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:00.080
I wrote, really, because I thought

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:02.720
if he were to say publicly

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:05.400
that he now realised
it was a mistake,

01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:08.520
that might discourage
somebody, somewhere

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.080
from doing something similar. Erm...

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:15.440
I asked him the questions
that I wanted answers to.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:19.440
I've never understood what triggered
the end of the hijack

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:21.480
and the violence.

01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:25.560
He said, "I will be more than glad

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.880
to discuss with you
any subject you wish to talk about.

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.400
I strongly believe this is
your basic right to know everything.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.600
If you wish,
you can send me your phone number

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.840
and I will try to call you one day."

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.680
Yes.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:31.720
I just wonder, what did you hope
would happen?"Ohh."

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.760
Do you remember?

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.560
I was expecting
that you would shoot me.

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.880
And you didn't, you know.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:34.040
You put me back with the others.

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.920
My brother had died in the mountains, yes.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.400
Wow.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:10.160
Thank you, Zaid. Goodbye.
"Bye-bye."

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.400
It doesn't really change
how awful it was

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.400
for all those people. It just...

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.480
...makes me feel
that my brother saved my life.

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.760
This is a picture of my brother, Imran.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.360
I named my son after my brother

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.120
and he has all the qualities
of my brother.

01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:01.400
- He's very brave.
- Oh, my God.
He's something else.

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.040
Sometimes it feels like
he has his soul.

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.080
He's very bold.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.320
He's very kind, compassionate. And...

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:16.360
...actually,
he's the reason I am alive.

01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:15.040
