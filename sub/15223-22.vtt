01:09.100 --> 01:11.901
Hey, Lou, you'll never believe
what happened to me.

01:11.934 --> 01:12.901
What's that?

01:12.934 --> 01:14.634
I pick up this fare
at the airport, right?

01:14.667 --> 01:16.734
Some foreign guy.
So he tells me,

01:16.767 --> 01:19.133
"Take me to the Plaza Hotel,"
which I do.

01:19.167 --> 01:21.767
When I get there,
there's $17 on the meter.

01:21.801 --> 01:24.601
The guy takes out
a hundred-dollar bill

01:24.634 --> 01:27.267
and asks me, "Is this enough?"

01:27.300 --> 01:29.767
Ooh, my Lord... whoo!

01:29.801 --> 01:31.968
Ooh, you lucky slob.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.400
Cabbie heaven!

01:33.434 --> 01:35.934
Oh, you know,
I drove a cab 15 years,

01:35.968 --> 01:37.267
waiting for something
like that to happen.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.434
It was
really wild.

01:38.467 --> 01:39.734
Ooh, a hundred dollars.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.834
Ooh, you must be
living right, Banta.

01:41.868 --> 01:42.901
What'd you do with the money?

01:42.934 --> 01:44.601
I gave him $83 change.

01:45.601 --> 01:46.901
Hey, Louie! Oy!

01:48.400 --> 01:49.367
You okay?

01:49.400 --> 01:50.367
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.901
I think I need
a cold drink.

01:52.701 --> 01:54.000
What happened
to <i>him?</i>

01:54.033 --> 01:56.334
Oh, Alex, I'm so
glad I caught you.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.634
Listen, I have a big
favor to ask you.

01:58.667 --> 02:01.000
I just found out that my aunt
up in Buffalo is sick,

02:01.033 --> 02:03.634
so I'm gonna go up there to
spend a couple days with her.

02:03.667 --> 02:04.968
I'm taking Jennifer with me,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.067
but my problem is Jason.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.234
See, he's got this big
spelling bee competition

02:08.267 --> 02:10.167
and the district finals
are this Saturday.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.667
I'd hate to have him miss it
after he's come this far.

02:12.701 --> 02:14.767
So, do you think it
would be all right

02:14.801 --> 02:16.267
if he stayed with you
a couple of days?

02:16.300 --> 02:18.067
Oh, please don't
feel pressured
into saying yes,

02:18.100 --> 02:21.100
but please say yes.

02:21.133 --> 02:23.601
What was that, Elaine?
I-I wasn't listening.

02:23.634 --> 02:24.968
Oh, ah, yeah, sure, sure.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.400
Yeah, yeah, I'd be
glad to. Why not?

02:26.434 --> 02:27.834
Oh, Alex, you're a doll!

02:27.868 --> 02:28.868
Oh, thanks so much.

02:28.901 --> 02:30.701
Oh, he-he's just in the car.
I'll go get him. Thanks.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.167
You don't have to thank me--
it'd be fun.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.901
I don't want to do this.

02:35.934 --> 02:37.300
What am I talking about?

02:37.334 --> 02:38.634
I <i>can't</i> do this.

02:38.667 --> 02:40.601
Thursday I'm supposed to
have dinner with my sister.

02:40.634 --> 02:41.801
Friday I've got this
really great date.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.000
Hey, Bobby, can
you help me out?

02:43.033 --> 02:44.734
Sure, I'll take your date out.

02:44.767 --> 02:46.000
What's she look like?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.667
Bob-Bobby, come on, will you?

02:47.701 --> 02:50.767
Aah, Alex, I don't know anything
about taking care of kids.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.734
Oh, all right.

02:54.767 --> 02:56.067
I'll help you out Thursday,

02:56.100 --> 02:57.968
but Friday I got
an acting class, all right?

02:58.000 --> 02:58.968
Great, great.
Okay.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.767
Hey, Tony, can you
help me out Friday?

03:01.767 --> 03:04.167
I guess I could, uh...

03:04.200 --> 03:05.334
Oh, but Friday afternoon

03:05.367 --> 03:08.334
I promised this guy I'd
spar with him at the gym.

03:08.367 --> 03:10.834
Oh, shoot.

03:10.868 --> 03:13.400
Hey, Alex, aren't you
going to ask me?

03:13.434 --> 03:15.734
Oh, sure, John. Can you
help me out Friday afternoon?

03:15.767 --> 03:17.200
No, I have a class.

03:17.234 --> 03:19.667
I just wanted to be
asked, that's all.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.534
Hey, maybe I could
take him Friday morning

03:21.567 --> 03:23.033
if Tony could switch
his sparring.

03:23.067 --> 03:25.133
Great. Maybe I could switch
my date to Friday afternoon

03:25.167 --> 03:26.534
if you could switch
your sparring...

03:26.567 --> 03:29.434
Oh, how did I get
myself into this here?

03:29.467 --> 03:30.968
Hey, this must be Jason!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.234
How are you, Jason?

03:32.267 --> 03:34.267
Jason, this is
Alex Rieger,
Hi.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.267
Bobby Wheeler,
Kid, how are you doing?

03:36.300 --> 03:37.300
John Burns....

03:37.334 --> 03:38.300
Hi.

03:38.334 --> 03:39.667
...and Tony Banta.

03:39.701 --> 03:41.000
Hi.

03:41.033 --> 03:42.400
Alex, I really
have to run.

03:42.434 --> 03:44.100
Are you sure you
can handle this?

03:44.133 --> 03:46.901
Yeah, yeah, yeah. the guys
said they'd volunteer.

03:46.934 --> 03:48.567
Hey, listen, you just,
uh, you just go ahead

03:48.601 --> 03:50.100
and, uh, make sure
your aunt gets well.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.367
Quick.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.501
Aw, thanks, guys.

03:52.534 --> 03:54.300
You're really
the greatest.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.634
( <i>kissing loudly</i> ):
Ooh! Mmm...

03:55.667 --> 03:56.834
I'm gonna miss you.

03:56.868 --> 03:58.934
Good luck on the
spelling bee Saturday.

03:58.968 --> 04:00.267
Okay, you be
a good boy now.

04:00.300 --> 04:01.100
Oh, I love you.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.200
Bye-bye.
Thanks, guys.

04:02.234 --> 04:05.234
Bye, Elaine.
Take care.
Yeah, Take it easy.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.968
( <i>chuckling</i>
 <i>nervously</i> )

04:16.100 --> 04:18.132
Well, I'll see
you guys later.
I got to go.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.634
Yeah, I got to run.
Nice meeting you, Jason.

04:19.666 --> 04:20.701
Gee, 10:00 already.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.000
Hey, Bob-Bobby,
listen, uh,

04:22.033 --> 04:23.167
I got to get something
from my locker.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.501
Would you just stay here
just a few minutes

04:24.534 --> 04:25.367
and talk to Jason, please?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.033
What-what am I going
to say to him?

04:27.067 --> 04:28.467
I don't know. You'll think
of something to say.

04:28.501 --> 04:29.968
Just for a few minutes.
I'll be right back.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.934
Hey, listen, Jason, we'll go get
some breakfast, okay? Thanks.

04:39.801 --> 04:40.968
( <i>exhales</i> )

04:42.601 --> 04:44.834
So you're a kid, huh?

04:47.267 --> 04:49.334
I try.

04:54.067 --> 04:55.968
Mom told me
you're an actor.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.167
Uh... yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.467
She says you're great.

04:59.501 --> 05:01.000
Oh, yeah?

05:01.934 --> 05:03.267
Can I ask you something?

05:03.300 --> 05:04.434
Oh, sure.
Here, come on.

05:04.467 --> 05:05.601
I'll put you up here.

05:05.634 --> 05:06.601
( <i>grunting</i> )

05:06.634 --> 05:07.767
Okay, shoot.

05:07.801 --> 05:09.567
You know, I'm really
scared about

05:09.601 --> 05:11.100
this spelling bee Saturday.

05:11.133 --> 05:13.100
How do you keep
from getting nervous

05:13.133 --> 05:14.968
when you have to stand up
in front of all those people?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.367
Everybody gets nervous
in front of an audience.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.367
Okay, Jason, let's go
grab a bite, okay?

05:19.400 --> 05:21.701
Hey, that's okay, Alex.
You've got things to do.

05:21.734 --> 05:23.334
I'll take Jason
out to breakfast.

05:23.367 --> 05:25.167
Yeah? That's
nice of you, Bob.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.167
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.467
Yeah. I'll bring him
over to your house

05:27.501 --> 05:28.501
when we're through,
all right?

05:28.534 --> 05:29.501
Okay.All right.

05:29.534 --> 05:30.701
Bye.
Take care
of his books.

05:30.734 --> 05:32.100
Bye.
What do you want
to eat, kid?

05:32.133 --> 05:33.734
Food.
Mmm...

05:36.434 --> 05:37.968
Hey, Alex.
Yeah?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.400
Kid gone yet?

05:40.934 --> 05:42.234
Yeah. Bobby just
took him out.

05:42.267 --> 05:43.400
Wh-Wh-What's wrong
with you?

05:43.434 --> 05:45.234
I don't know,
I guess I just panicked.

05:45.267 --> 05:47.033
I don't know what to do
around a kid.

05:47.067 --> 05:49.200
Do what you do
when you were a kid.

05:49.234 --> 05:50.868
You want me to punch him?

05:52.834 --> 05:54.367
Let's go get some
breakfast, okay?

06:01.734 --> 06:03.133
Yes, ma'am.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.567
Yes, I hear you.

06:04.601 --> 06:07.601
You say one of our drivers
was rude to you.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.701
What was it he said exactly?

06:10.834 --> 06:12.234
I see.

06:12.267 --> 06:14.834
And how fat <i>are</i> you?

06:16.067 --> 06:17.534
Come on!

06:17.567 --> 06:18.634
I'll get you.

06:18.667 --> 06:19.734
Come here!

06:22.801 --> 06:25.734
Oh, man, you were
great today, man.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.133
Hey, Louie, you should
have seen him.

06:27.167 --> 06:28.033
Two boxing lessons

06:28.067 --> 06:29.501
and he can already
beat my brains out.

06:29.534 --> 06:31.501
What took him so long?

06:31.534 --> 06:33.367
Would you hold on
a minute, please?

06:33.400 --> 06:35.767
Burns is looking for
you guys. He's upstairs.

06:35.801 --> 06:37.267
Oh, man, he must be mad
'cause we're late.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.067
I'm gonna go get him.

06:38.100 --> 06:39.501
Okay, thanks again
for today, Tony.

06:39.534 --> 06:40.501
That's all right.

06:40.534 --> 06:41.901
Listen...

06:41.934 --> 06:44.467
Yeah, don't you worry, really.

06:44.501 --> 06:47.501
I'm gonna give that driver
a severe reprimand.

06:47.534 --> 06:51.534
We here at the Sunshine Cab
Company expect all our cabbies

06:51.567 --> 06:54.467
to be kind and courteous
to every passenger

06:54.501 --> 06:56.701
especially you blimpos.

06:58.434 --> 07:00.000
Don't mention it.

07:03.334 --> 07:05.300
That was a complaint.

07:05.334 --> 07:07.334
That's one of the
most difficult things

07:07.367 --> 07:09.033
about being
a dispatcher--

07:09.067 --> 07:13.367
handling these delicate
situations with tact.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.901
You know something, it's funny.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.734
I don't dislike you
as much as I do most kids.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.200
Thank you.

07:19.234 --> 07:22.234
I guess that's 'cause we've
got something in common.

07:22.267 --> 07:24.701
I was raised
by my mother, too.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.234
Tell me something,
do... do you smoke?

07:29.267 --> 07:29.801
You drink?

07:30.834 --> 07:33.267
Use foul language?

07:33.300 --> 07:36.934
Yeah, it's really tough
without a father to teach you.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.033
Hey, John.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.033
Huh?

07:41.067 --> 07:42.234
I'm sorry
we were so late,

07:42.267 --> 07:44.901
but I was having such fun
that I forgot all about time.

07:44.934 --> 07:46.200
Oh, that's okay,
we have half an hour

07:46.234 --> 07:47.033
before the movie starts.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.033
Oh, yeah?
What are you gonna see?

07:48.067 --> 07:49.100
 <i>Death on the Nile.</i>

07:49.133 --> 07:51.167
Hey, I saw it last week.
I sat through it three times.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.167
It was that good, huh?

07:52.200 --> 07:54.901
Nah, I just couldn't remember
where I came in.

07:57.667 --> 07:59.467
Hey, I figured
we'd go to the movies.

07:59.501 --> 08:00.467
How do you like that?

08:00.501 --> 08:01.767
Yeah, sure.

08:01.801 --> 08:04.501
The only thing is, I really
haven't finished studying

08:04.534 --> 08:06.167
for my spelling bee yet.

08:06.200 --> 08:11.000
Oh. Well, that's okay.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.367
We don't have to
go to the movies.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.434
Hey, what are you
worried about?

08:15.467 --> 08:17.067
I can tell you
how it ends anyway.

08:17.100 --> 08:19.133
Or was that the middle?

08:19.167 --> 08:22.033
Anyhow, I guess I'd
better call Suzanne.

08:22.067 --> 08:23.567
She was gonna
meet us afterwards.

08:23.601 --> 08:25.100
JASON:
Mm.No, really, John.

08:25.133 --> 08:27.234
Please, let's go to the movie.

08:27.267 --> 08:29.167
I got plenty of time
to study.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.300
I'm almost through
the whole dictionary.

08:31.334 --> 08:33.000
I'm already up
to the S's.

08:33.033 --> 08:35.333
Okay! We'll see you, Tony.

08:35.366 --> 08:36.900
ALEX:
Hey, you two
off somewhere?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.100
Yeah, we're going
to the movies.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.433
Make sure
it's a "G" rating.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.067
Hey, look, John, will you
get him back by 6:00?

08:41.100 --> 08:43.234
I've got tickets
to the Knicks game tonight.

08:43.267 --> 08:45.667
All right!
Yeah, we'll
be back.

08:45.701 --> 08:46.767
Thanks, John.See ya.

08:46.801 --> 08:47.801
Okay, I'll
see you guys.

08:47.834 --> 08:48.801
Yeah, bye.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.133
Bye, Mr. De Palma.

08:50.167 --> 08:51.467
LOUIE:
Oh.

08:51.501 --> 08:53.133
Cute kid,
isn't he?

08:53.167 --> 08:54.300
Yeah.
Hey, incidentally,

08:54.334 --> 08:55.701
did you check with Harris
on the day shift to see if

08:55.734 --> 08:56.968
he could take care of
the kid tomorrow night?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.400
Yeah, I talked to him.
He's busy.

08:58.434 --> 09:00.434
There's no way I can
get back on time.

09:00.467 --> 09:03.234
I'd love to, but I've got to go
to acting class tomorrow night.

09:03.267 --> 09:04.234
I'm doing a scene.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.200
So who we gonna get
to take care of Jason?

09:06.234 --> 09:07.868
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

09:11.133 --> 09:12.267
Gee, I... I...
I don't know.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.601
I mean, that's
a real problem.

09:13.634 --> 09:15.334
There's got to be somebody
around here that can do it.

09:15.367 --> 09:16.467
Yeah, somebody.

09:16.501 --> 09:18.968
( <i>coughing</i>
 <i>loudly</i> )

09:21.434 --> 09:22.467
I mean, it
would only be

09:22.501 --> 09:23.467
for a couple
of hours.

09:23.501 --> 09:24.467
There must
be somebody

09:24.501 --> 09:25.501
who could
help us out.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.367
Uh... let's see...
look around...

09:30.400 --> 09:31.367
Who's here?

09:31.400 --> 09:34.567
( <i>hacking loudly</i> )

09:34.601 --> 09:36.701
TONY:
I can't think
of a soul.

09:36.734 --> 09:38.133
Nobody I can
think of.

09:38.167 --> 09:39.133
Me either.

09:39.167 --> 09:40.167
Hmm...

09:40.200 --> 09:42.968
( <i>hacking loudly</i> )

09:43.000 --> 09:46.734
( <i>clearing throat loudly</i> )

09:46.767 --> 09:48.367
I got it.
What?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.567
Why don't
we ask Louie?

09:50.601 --> 09:52.567
Nah, I don't
want Jason to
catch his cold.

09:52.601 --> 09:53.767
Yeah.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.467
JASON:
Alex, you home?

10:04.501 --> 10:06.868
Yeah, I'm in here.
I'm just changing.

10:06.901 --> 10:09.367
Louie and his mother took me
to the wrestling matches.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.601
Great fight.Hey.

10:10.634 --> 10:13.200
Hey, Louie, I didn't
know you smoked cigars.

10:13.234 --> 10:17.267
I don't as a rule, but Ma
couldn't finish it, so...

10:17.300 --> 10:19.767
So are you guys going
someplace else?

10:19.801 --> 10:21.801
Yeah, well, I thought we might
go out and get some ice cream.

10:21.834 --> 10:22.567
What do you say?

10:22.601 --> 10:23.567
Whoo.Gee, I don't know.

10:23.601 --> 10:25.734
I really should
do some studying

10:25.767 --> 10:27.000
for the spelling
bee tomorrow.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

10:28.033 --> 10:29.634
Hey, listen, we've been
keeping you so busy,

10:29.667 --> 10:30.901
you haven't had
a chance to study.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.834
You sure you're going to be
all right for tomorrow?

10:32.868 --> 10:36.601
Yeah, sure. I just need one good
night's work and I'll be fine.

10:36.634 --> 10:38.534
Well, I got to go.
Ma's in the car.

10:38.567 --> 10:40.300
She didn't feel like coming in.

10:40.334 --> 10:41.868
She's really self-conscious.

10:41.901 --> 10:43.834
She spilled beer
all over her dress.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.067
( <i>car horn honks</i> )

10:45.100 --> 10:46.067
That's her.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.067
I got to go.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.601
Hey, thanks again
for tonight, Louie.

10:48.634 --> 10:49.801

I give, I give!

10:49.834 --> 10:51.434
( <i>horn honking</i> )

10:51.467 --> 10:52.567
I got to get going.

10:52.601 --> 10:54.100
I don't like to keep
my mother waiting.

10:54.133 --> 10:55.267
( <i>honk honking</i> )

10:55.300 --> 10:58.267
Keep your pants on, crazy lady!

10:59.801 --> 11:00.801
See you.

11:04.567 --> 11:07.267
Well, look, kid, I'll
get out of your way.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.400
Are you sure
you're not too tired

11:09.434 --> 11:11.267
from all this
running around, huh?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.200
Not at all; the running around
has been fun.

11:13.234 --> 11:15.334
Now I feel like getting to work.

11:15.367 --> 11:16.667
Okay.

11:16.701 --> 11:18.667
Go get 'em, champ.

11:18.701 --> 11:19.801
Right.

11:38.100 --> 11:41.100
( <i>snoring</i> )

11:55.801 --> 11:58.534
Oh, Jason, uh...
you feel ready?

11:58.567 --> 12:01.033
You want to go over
a few more words

12:01.067 --> 12:02.667
just to make sure?

12:02.701 --> 12:05.100
Um, spell, um...

12:05.133 --> 12:06.834
"Encyclopedia."

12:06.868 --> 12:09.734
E-n-c-y-c-l-o-p-e-d-i-a.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.400
Is that right?

12:13.567 --> 12:14.634
Yeah.

12:14.667 --> 12:15.968
Good, good.
You're ready.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.968
( <i>chuckles</i> )

12:17.000 --> 12:18.434
Hey, look
who's here.

12:18.467 --> 12:19.801
Hey!
Hi!

12:19.834 --> 12:21.601
Hey, Alex.
Excuse me.

12:21.634 --> 12:24.033
You mean everybody
came to watch me?

12:24.067 --> 12:25.300
Looks that way.

12:25.334 --> 12:26.901
Surprise!
We're all here!

12:26.934 --> 12:28.901
And Suzanne sends
her luck, too.

12:28.934 --> 12:30.100
JASON:
This is super!

12:30.133 --> 12:32.734
Hey, Louie! You
came here for this?

12:32.767 --> 12:34.133
Why shouldn't I come?

12:34.167 --> 12:36.167
I happen to love
spelling bees.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.834
Look who's here.

12:37.868 --> 12:39.501
How about this?

12:39.534 --> 12:40.901
You got nothing
to worry about.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.000
I can tell just by looking
at the rest of them,

12:43.033 --> 12:45.000
they're all losers.

12:45.033 --> 12:46.400
Okay, pal.

ANNOUNCER:
May I have your attention,
please?

12:48.634 --> 12:51.934
Would the contestants please
take their places onstage?

12:51.968 --> 12:54.300
You show them
how to spell, man.

12:54.334 --> 12:55.701
All right!

12:55.734 --> 12:56.734
Guys, sit down.

13:05.767 --> 13:08.133
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

13:08.167 --> 13:10.167
welcome to the district finals

13:10.200 --> 13:12.667

Spelling Bee Contest.

13:12.701 --> 13:14.300
Now, without any further delay,

13:14.334 --> 13:16.167
let me introduce
the contestants.

13:16.200 --> 13:21.501
Our first finalist,
from PS 25 in the Bronx,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.901
is Miss Christa Fowler.

13:23.934 --> 13:25.300

13:26.667 --> 13:28.300
Uh, that's my daughter.

13:28.334 --> 13:29.367
Hmm...

13:29.400 --> 13:30.901
Well, she's a loser.

13:30.934 --> 13:31.934
Hey.

13:39.667 --> 13:43.033
Our second finalist,
from PS 33 in New York,

13:49.133 --> 13:50.801
( <i>cheering</i> )

13:52.167 --> 13:55.667
20 bucks says
my kid beats your kid.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.534
I beg your pardon?

13:57.567 --> 13:58.534
What's the matter?

13:58.567 --> 13:59.567
A little wager
on the side.

13:59.601 --> 14:00.601
What do you say?

14:00.634 --> 14:03.300
I do not bet
on my child.

14:03.334 --> 14:05.868
That's 'cause you
know she's a loser.

14:05.901 --> 14:07.367
Hey, Louie, will
you get over here?

14:07.400 --> 14:08.934
How about you? You want
to put a little money on it?

14:08.968 --> 14:10.300
Louie! Look,
sit down.

14:14.434 --> 14:17.834
And our fifth finalist,
from PS 55 in Queens,

14:17.868 --> 14:19.934
is Marilou Hartman.

14:19.968 --> 14:22.400
( <i>applause</i> )

14:22.434 --> 14:24.367
That concludes
our introductions,

14:24.400 --> 14:27.734
so if the judges are ready,
let the contest begin.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.067
Please step to the microphone,
our first contestant.

14:33.234 --> 14:35.968
The word is "coagulate."

14:36.000 --> 14:38.067
"Coagulate."

14:38.100 --> 14:43.033
C-o-a-g-u-l-a-t-e.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.901
Correct.

Contestant number two.

( <i>applause</i> )

14:50.033 --> 14:51.067
Okay, here we go.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.801
The first round
is always the
toughest.

14:52.834 --> 14:54.133
You ought
to know, Banta.

14:54.167 --> 14:56.000
It's the only one
you ever fight in.

14:57.934 --> 15:01.267
The word is "phosphorous."

15:02.868 --> 15:04.701
"Phosphorous."

15:04.734 --> 15:09.834
P-h-o-s-p-h-o-r-o-u-s.

15:11.100 --> 15:11.834
Correct.

15:11.868 --> 15:15.067

15:15.100 --> 15:17.267
Jason! Jason! Jason!

15:19.367 --> 15:21.334
( <i>weak chuckle</i> )

15:21.367 --> 15:22.901
You'll have
to excuse us.

15:22.934 --> 15:24.367
We're a little
excited.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.634
Yeah... we're
his father.

15:32.367 --> 15:37.267
Marilou, the word
is "hypochondriac."

15:37.300 --> 15:39.033
"Hypochondriac."

15:39.067 --> 15:46.868
H-y-p-e-r-c-h-o-n-d-r-i-a-c.

15:46.901 --> 15:48.467
I'm sorry,
that's incorrect.

15:48.501 --> 15:49.734
Audience:
Oh...

15:49.767 --> 15:51.400
Hmm.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're now down

15:54.434 --> 15:56.367
to our final
two contestants.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.167
Now, should either of them
now miss a word,

15:58.200 --> 16:00.067
the other one will have
to spell it correctly

16:00.100 --> 16:03.367
before he or she can be
declared the winner.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.133
Christa...

16:06.167 --> 16:09.634
the word is "onomatopoeia."

16:09.667 --> 16:13.400
"Onomatopoeia."

16:13.434 --> 16:18.968
O-n-o-m-a-t-o-p-o-e-i-a.

16:20.033 --> 16:21.100
Correct!

16:21.133 --> 16:23.100
( <i>applause</i> )

16:26.667 --> 16:28.167
Lucky guess.

16:29.801 --> 16:32.033
Louie, give her
credit; she's good.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.033
I know...

16:33.067 --> 16:34.334
I hate her.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.000
Jason, the word is
"chlorophyll."

16:40.033 --> 16:41.033
Ooh!

16:41.067 --> 16:42.767
Is that with
one "l" or two "l's"?

16:42.801 --> 16:43.834
Probably.

16:43.868 --> 16:47.467
"Chlorophyll."

16:47.501 --> 16:53.868
C-h-l-o-r-o-p-h-y-l...

16:53.901 --> 16:55.167
...-l.

16:56.200 --> 16:56.934
Correct.

16:56.968 --> 17:01.234
( <i>applause</i> )

17:01.267 --> 17:02.634
That was close.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.032
ANNOUNCER:
Christa...

17:04.067 --> 17:07.166
The word is "sesquipedalian."

17:07.200 --> 17:09.733
Why does she get
all the easy ones?

17:11.867 --> 17:14.300
"Sesquipedalian."

17:14.334 --> 17:20.634
S-e-s-q-u-i-p-e-d-a-l-i-a-n.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.567
Correct!

17:24.534 --> 17:25.901
Jason...

17:25.934 --> 17:28.801
The word
is "vermeil."

17:28.834 --> 17:30.434
"Vermeil."

17:30.467 --> 17:33.367
V-e-r-m...

17:33.400 --> 17:34.734
i-e-l.

17:35.567 --> 17:36.901
That is incorrect.

17:36.934 --> 17:37.901

Christa, you must now spell
the word correctly

17:43.133 --> 17:44.267
if you wish to be...

17:44.300 --> 17:45.467
"Vermeil."

17:45.501 --> 17:48.868
V-e-r-m-e-i-l.

new district champion!

( <i>grumbling</i> )

18:09.934 --> 18:11.300
Hey, you did
your best.

18:11.334 --> 18:12.901
That's the main thing,
man. Come on.

18:12.934 --> 18:13.968
Hey, let me tell you.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.234
Coming in second
ain't the worst
thing in the world.

18:16.267 --> 18:19.634
Right. Tony does it
all the time.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.667
Hey, Jason, you shouldn't
feel bad about losing.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.067
It wasn't your fault.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.868
No? Whose fault was it?

18:25.901 --> 18:27.701
Ours.

18:27.734 --> 18:28.934
I mean, how could he study?

18:28.968 --> 18:30.701
He was so exhausted
from all the boxing

18:30.734 --> 18:32.167
and the movies
and the wrestling.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.767
If anybody should feel bad
right now, it ought to be us.

18:34.801 --> 18:35.767
Hi, guys!

18:35.801 --> 18:36.767
And her.

18:36.801 --> 18:37.701
Hey, Elaine!

18:37.734 --> 18:38.734
Hey, Elaine,
how you doing?

18:38.767 --> 18:39.734
Hi, Elaine.

18:39.767 --> 18:40.734
( <i>loud kiss</i> )

18:40.767 --> 18:41.734
Hey, how's
your aunt?

18:41.767 --> 18:42.767
She's much better. Thanks.

18:42.801 --> 18:44.234
Ooh, how's my boy?

18:44.267 --> 18:46.067
How did you do
in the spelling bee?

18:46.100 --> 18:48.434
Not so well, Mom. I lost.

18:48.467 --> 18:49.801
Aw... well.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.000
I think you should know,
Elaine,

18:51.033 --> 18:52.434
it wasn't his fault,
it was our fault.

18:52.467 --> 18:53.634
BOBBY:
Yeah, that's right.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.801
We were having such
a good time with him

18:55.834 --> 18:57.467
that he never had
a chance to study.

18:57.501 --> 18:59.000
It was our fault, really.

18:59.033 --> 19:01.167
That's nice of
you guys to say,

19:01.200 --> 19:03.300
but I'm the one
who blew it.

19:03.334 --> 19:06.234
Studying was supposed
to be my responsibility,

19:06.267 --> 19:07.634
not anybody else's.

19:07.667 --> 19:10.067
It was nobody's
fault but mine.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.133
You know something?

19:14.167 --> 19:17.901
If I had to choose
between your winning

19:17.934 --> 19:20.501
or losing and saying
what you just said...

19:21.834 --> 19:23.667
I'd still take winning,
but this was close.

19:23.701 --> 19:25.100
( <i>all laughing</i> )

19:25.133 --> 19:27.300
Come on, your sister's
in the car. Let's go home.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.467
Bye, J.

19:30.501 --> 19:31.634
Hey, go get
'em, Jason.

19:31.667 --> 19:32.767
You did good,
Jason.

19:32.801 --> 19:34.267
You come back
and visit us,
all right?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.267
You'll get it...

19:35.300 --> 19:36.801
JASON:
Good-bye, Mr. De Palma.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.634
See you, Jason.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.167
Mm, thanks from me, too, guys.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.667
You're the greatest.

19:42.701 --> 19:46.167
No, we're not... but I'll
tell you one thing, Elaine.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.834
That is some kid
you got there, you know?

19:48.868 --> 19:51.434
I know. Bye-bye. Thanks.

19:51.467 --> 19:53.267
See you.
Later, Elaine.

20:04.734 --> 20:08.634
Okay, I got something I was
saving for a real occasion.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.834
I'm going to share it
with you guys.

20:10.868 --> 20:12.400
This is an occasion?

20:12.434 --> 20:15.834
Whenever Louie shares anything,
it's an occasion.

20:18.234 --> 20:20.767
I'll bet you've never tasted
stuff like this before.

20:20.801 --> 20:21.767
What's that?

20:21.801 --> 20:23.400
12-year-old Scotch.

20:24.734 --> 20:27.901
You know, I never thought much
about having kids before,

20:27.934 --> 20:29.534
but if I was gonna have one,

20:29.567 --> 20:31.434
I think that'd be
the kid I want.

20:31.467 --> 20:33.968
Yeah, Suzanne and I
have talked about kids,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.767
but we decided to wait
until we find out how.

20:39.801 --> 20:41.467
I mean, how to raise them.

20:41.501 --> 20:44.801
I mean, gee, you see
how good Elaine did, you know.

20:44.834 --> 20:46.400
It makes you think
that you could, too.

20:46.434 --> 20:48.801
It's kind of funny, you know,

20:48.834 --> 20:50.934
getting tied down
with a wife and kids.

20:50.968 --> 20:54.300
I must have spent half my life
trying to avoid that, but, uh...

20:54.334 --> 20:56.467
now I'm starting to wonder
what I'm missing.

20:56.501 --> 20:59.367
What have you got
to worry about?

20:59.400 --> 21:01.100
You're young.

21:01.133 --> 21:03.501
You still got a chance.

21:03.534 --> 21:06.534
I'm never gonna have a son.

21:06.567 --> 21:07.801
Me...

21:07.834 --> 21:09.801
Louie De Palma.

21:09.834 --> 21:12.033
And I'd have made
a great old man, too.

21:12.067 --> 21:13.434
What are you talking about,
Louie?

21:13.467 --> 21:14.634
You could still have a kid.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.033
Nah!

21:17.067 --> 21:19.467
First you got to find a woman.

21:21.801 --> 21:24.100
You got to fall in love...

21:24.133 --> 21:25.601
get married...

21:25.634 --> 21:27.300
talk to her. Hmm.

21:28.801 --> 21:30.834
It ain't worth it.

21:32.667 --> 21:35.501
You know, you guys are just
looking at the good stuff.

21:35.534 --> 21:38.100
What about all the money
it takes to raise a kid?

21:38.133 --> 21:41.367
Not to mention the heartache
and the worry that goes into it.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.234
You worry from the day they're
born and it never stops.

21:44.267 --> 21:46.868
Are they eating enough?
Are they eating too much?

21:46.901 --> 21:48.701
Are their teeth
coming in straight?

21:48.734 --> 21:50.167
You worry when they're sick.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.167
You worry when they don't
come home from school on time.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.300
You worry about their grades.

21:53.334 --> 21:54.300
You worry about
whether they're...

21:54.334 --> 21:56.133
they're running around
with the right kids.

21:56.167 --> 22:00.067
You worry if they're gonna meet
the right girl, about a job...

22:00.100 --> 22:01.367
I mean it never ends.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.067
So what's it all for?

22:04.100 --> 22:06.434
I mean, what's the best
you get out of it?

22:06.467 --> 22:08.400
Maybe a hug and a kiss
every now and then

22:08.434 --> 22:10.234
because the kid
feels like he has to.

22:10.267 --> 22:14.234
All in all...

22:14.267 --> 22:16.000
it's not a bad deal.

22:30.033 --> 22:35.434
* Climb upon my knee,
sonny boy... *

22:43.634 --> 22:46.534
* You're
only three... *

22:46.567 --> 22:48.100
What's my name?

22:48.133 --> 22:51.334
* Sonny boy. 

22:51.367 --> 22:52.834
What's there no way of?

22:52.868 --> 22:55.267
* There's no way
of knowing... *

22:55.300 --> 22:57.300
What else is there
no way of?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.934
* There's no way
of showing... *

22:59.968 --> 23:01.467
What means who to who?

23:01.501 --> 23:04.868
* Oh, what you
mean to me... *

23:04.901 --> 23:06.567
What's my name again?

23:06.601 --> 23:11.033
* Sonny boy. 

23:11.067 --> 23:14.434
* Oh, when there
are gray skies... *

23:14.467 --> 23:17.033
Oh, I hate the gray skies,
don't you?

23:17.067 --> 23:20.234
* I don't mind
the gray skies... *

23:20.267 --> 23:22.534
How do you
explain that?

23:22.567 --> 23:25.767
* You make
them blue... *

23:25.801 --> 23:26.767
Would you
believe it?

23:26.801 --> 23:28.300
I forgot
my name again.

23:28.334 --> 23:29.734
* Sonny boy. 

23:29.767 --> 23:32.300
That's it.

23:32.334 --> 23:35.234
* Friends may
forsake me... *

23:35.267 --> 23:38.334
It wouldn't
surprise me a bit.

23:38.367 --> 23:41.534
* Let them all
forsake me... *

23:41.567 --> 23:43.767
That's a rather
cavalier attitude.

23:43.801 --> 23:55.734
ALL:
* I still have you, Sonny boy. 

23:58.000 --> 24:00.801
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:25.033 --> 24:26.701
WOMAN:
Good night, Mr. Walters.

24:26.734 --> 24:27.934
( <i>Walters grunts</i> )
