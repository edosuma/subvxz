01:22.790 --> 01:25.540
You've been staring
at that same file for ten minutes now.

01:26.210 --> 01:28.710
It's like watching
the world's worst nature documentary.

01:31.250 --> 01:34.340
Have you lost the power of speech
alongside the ability to read?

01:34.420 --> 01:37.220
Have you achieved
your final form? [chuckles]

01:37.760 --> 01:39.720
What am I supposed
to do with that, Lucifer?

01:40.970 --> 01:42.350
How am I supposed to react?

01:42.430 --> 01:44.600
[hesitates] I don't follow.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.940
Well, I know you're the Devil now.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.690
You come at me with these sort of funny,
kind of clever insults, I give back.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.440
We go into a little insult dance,

01:54.110 --> 01:55.360
and that's a Tuesday.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.200
But now everything's changed.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.660
Don't be ridiculous, Daniel.
Nothing's changed.

02:00.740 --> 02:04.120
I'm still the same person,
charming, beloved.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.460
And you're still the same person too,
useless, tolerated.

02:07.540 --> 02:10.460
Hmm. Doesn't have the same effect anymore.

02:10.540 --> 02:13.170
It's like being teased
by Genghis Khan or Darth Vader.

02:14.130 --> 02:16.460
I'm not some bloody villain, Daniel.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.930
Oh, well,
if you're gonna be cruel about it.

02:20.510 --> 02:22.220
Don't be coming to me for any favors.

Detective Douche
is a real joy to be around today.

02:30.850 --> 02:33.400
You just have to give him some time.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.650
Remember what I did
when I first found out the truth?

02:35.730 --> 02:41.030
Yes, you ran off to Europe for a month.
Oh, maybe Dan could do with a vacation.

02:41.110 --> 02:42.620
Who do I know in one of those countries

02:42.700 --> 02:45.030
where they hunt
American tourists for sport?

02:45.830 --> 02:50.870
Right. Look, I'm sorry you're hurt
that you can't annoy Dan.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.460
Why would I be hurt?

02:52.540 --> 02:56.090
Uh, well,
because it's the strange little game

02:56.170 --> 02:58.170
that you two play
to show that you're friends.

02:58.260 --> 03:00.090
-But he's not participating anymore.
-[scoffs]

03:00.170 --> 03:02.220
So just give him some time.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.850
Detective Douche can take all the time
he needs, as far as I'm concerned.

03:06.390 --> 03:08.270
Now, please tell me we have a case,

03:08.350 --> 03:11.690
some puzzle to solve,
some criminal to bring in and punish.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.110
It's right here,
and we do have someone to bring in,

03:14.190 --> 03:16.320
but she's already been apprehended.
Extradition.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.400
A Los X banger,
got caught south of the border.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.860
Extradition?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.410
We catch murderers, Detective.
We don't carpool them.

03:23.490 --> 03:27.160
Lucifer… we do,

03:27.240 --> 03:28.540
when we're understaffed.

03:28.620 --> 03:31.920
-I know it's grunt work, but we have to--
-Grunt work, you say?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.340
Hmm.

03:38.630 --> 03:41.090
[sighs] All right.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.970
"All right"? That's it?

03:44.050 --> 03:46.600
[sighs] Chloe has Trixie tonight,

03:46.680 --> 03:49.350
and honestly,
I think a drive might be good for me.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.350
[Lucifer groans]

03:50.430 --> 03:52.940
It'll give me some time
to think about things.

03:53.020 --> 03:53.850
[Lucifer] Huh.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.650
Hey, Dan.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.320
Did you notice the name of
the processing officer on the other end?

04:06.490 --> 04:07.990
-Luis Navarro.
-[Chloe] Uh-huh.

04:08.080 --> 04:11.660
I just wanna remind you of the last time
you worked a task force together.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.670
I remember. Look, you don't have to worry.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.710
Yes, we were friends,
but I know what kind of cop this guy is.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.800
The kind of cop who likes to cut corners,

04:19.880 --> 04:23.510
the kind of cop looking to play angles
on a slippery slope to being a criminal--

04:23.590 --> 04:27.680
The kind of cop
that I haven't been for a very long time.

04:27.760 --> 04:31.430
I'm sorry, I know.
I'm not your mother, and I'm not…

04:33.310 --> 04:35.560
even your wife anymore,
but I am your friend.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.400
I know it's been a crazy time lately.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.780
I think the last voice that you need
in your head right now is one like Luis'.

04:42.860 --> 04:46.910
I know you're trying to look out for me,
and I appreciate that, but I'm fine.

04:47.950 --> 04:50.200

05:23.940 --> 05:26.030
Luis, what are we doing in a bar?

05:26.110 --> 05:28.360
I'm here
for the extradition of a prisoner.

05:28.450 --> 05:29.870
[laughing]

05:29.950 --> 05:32.080
[in English] Hermano, your Spanish

05:32.160 --> 05:34.830
is about as rusty
as that squad car outside.

05:34.910 --> 05:37.250
You need
to stay down here a little longer.

05:37.330 --> 05:40.960
-Get a little Spanish immersion.
-Yeah, I'll talk to my captain about it.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.010
Listen, why are we not meeting
at the police station, bro?

05:44.090 --> 05:46.510
Oh, crap. You didn't get the message?

05:47.550 --> 05:48.510
What message?

05:49.180 --> 05:50.470
Sorry, man.

05:51.010 --> 05:53.060
There was a screwup in the paperwork.

05:53.140 --> 05:55.680
The prisoner won't be discharged
till tomorrow morning.

05:55.770 --> 05:58.520
What, are you kidding me, bro?
I drove all the way down here.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.480
I know. I know, but I got it. It's fine.
I made sure that they got you a room.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.400
-It's a few blocks away.
-[sighs]

06:05.490 --> 06:09.240
All right, all right, yeah. Uh… just for
the night. I gotta get back, all right?

06:09.320 --> 06:12.120
Hey, compadre!

06:12.200 --> 06:13.990
-[clears throat]
-Now we get caught up.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.870
-Yeah.
-I wanted you to see this place.

06:15.950 --> 06:17.330
I own a little piece of it.

06:17.410 --> 06:19.750
-Nice.
-Let's get some drinks for old times.

06:19.830 --> 06:22.000
I don't know, man.
It's really late, you know.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.130
If I gotta get on the road early
in the morning, I don't think so.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.510
Daniel. I get it.

06:27.590 --> 06:28.670
I do, okay?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.550
Maybe those old times,

06:30.640 --> 06:33.390
they weren't so good, okay?
We used to play it fast and loose.

06:33.470 --> 06:35.310
And I know you don't do that anymore.

06:35.390 --> 06:38.600
And the truth is, I admire you for that.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.060
I'm turning myself around too, and,

06:41.150 --> 06:44.730
I just wanted to get some advice
from someone who did it before I did.

06:44.820 --> 06:46.110
That's all.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.450
One drink.

06:50.530 --> 06:54.200
-[shouting in Spanish]
-[in English] One, just one. No!

-[Dan] Salud.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.960
-Oh, man.
-[exhales]

07:02.080 --> 07:03.250
I've had my few beers.

07:03.330 --> 07:06.840
I think I should go check out
the hotel room and watch some HBO.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.260
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.800
-One more drink so I can ask you.
-[sighs]

07:11.880 --> 07:14.430
Back in the day,
when you had that old partner.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.350
You guys had some fun extracurriculars.

07:18.850 --> 07:20.810
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-What changed that for you?

07:21.390 --> 07:24.480
Uh, it's pretty simple, really. Uh…

07:25.150 --> 07:29.030
Couple years back, I got into
some trouble on Palmetto Street.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.110
Long story short,
I got in way over my head,

07:32.950 --> 07:35.320
and I realized that
when your motives are bad

07:35.410 --> 07:37.580
and when you're only out for yourself,

07:37.660 --> 07:39.330
your actions have consequences.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.500
But now?

07:43.040 --> 07:43.960
Ah, it's just…

07:46.380 --> 07:48.550
Let's just say that I had

07:48.630 --> 07:50.050
a moment of clarity.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.590
Think God and the Devil.
Let's say they're real, right?

07:54.680 --> 07:57.010
-Like, as real as you and me.
-Huh.

07:57.100 --> 07:58.350
You find that out…

07:59.720 --> 08:02.390
makes you worry more. Not less.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.690
You mean like your soul?

08:04.770 --> 08:06.940
[laughing]

08:07.020 --> 08:09.650
No, man. Worse, way worse.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.700
Because if God is like you and me,

08:12.780 --> 08:14.070
that means he's fallible.

08:15.410 --> 08:16.780
He makes mistakes.

08:17.950 --> 08:22.410
And if God can make a mistake,
what does that say about the universe?

08:22.500 --> 08:25.460
I mean, who's even in charge?

08:25.540 --> 08:27.420
How could anything even matter anymore?

08:28.670 --> 08:29.750
That's heavy, man.

08:33.050 --> 08:35.800
But if you're feeling like
nothing really matters, then…

08:36.720 --> 08:40.640
maybe you'll consider joining me
in a business venture.

08:40.720 --> 08:41.600
[Dan groans]

08:41.680 --> 08:44.520
I run these holistic crystals up to LA.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.520
Housewives up there love this shit, okay?

08:47.610 --> 08:50.070
I tell them that
they're ancient Aztec cenotes.

08:50.150 --> 08:52.860
But really they're just beach rocks,
my friend.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.200
I pick them from my sister's property
in Rosarito. Pure profit!

08:56.280 --> 08:59.120
I thought you said you weren't
into anything illegal any more.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.160
Illegal? They're rocks.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.620
So it's legit?

09:02.700 --> 09:04.540
It's legit money. Huh?

09:04.620 --> 09:05.540
It's low-risk.

09:05.620 --> 09:09.880
I just need a man on the other end
to make sure that it runs smooth.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.340
Just not me anymore, man.

09:14.130 --> 09:15.090
Can't help you.

09:16.510 --> 09:17.800
I understand.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.560
It's no problem. Stupid idea. Okay?

09:20.640 --> 09:21.810
[laughs]

09:21.890 --> 09:23.810
I'm just happy you're here now.

09:24.390 --> 09:25.230

-Oh, come on.

09:31.150 --> 09:33.900
This is Benito. He's my partner.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.740
-You know why Benito is always smiling?
-Why?

09:36.820 --> 09:40.030
-He's got the best tequila in town.

Where's my phone? We need help!

10:30.830 --> 10:31.670
[panting]

10:31.750 --> 10:34.340
-What? Why are you naked?
-[Dan] What?

10:35.300 --> 10:39.340
Oh, uh, uh, because I sleep naked.
It's a thing. Don't worry about it.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.470
Benito. He's dead!

10:43.350 --> 10:47.430
If this is some kind of sick joke,
Danimal, I swear…

10:47.520 --> 10:50.230
[groans]

10:50.310 --> 10:52.440
Oh, God. You're right.

10:53.020 --> 10:53.860
He's dead.

10:53.940 --> 10:55.610
Yeah. [panting]

10:55.690 --> 10:57.820
Look, man, we need to call this in.

10:57.900 --> 11:01.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.620
Hold on.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.080
Take a breath.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.990
Let's think this through.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.620
What do you mean, think this through?

11:09.790 --> 11:11.210
Wait, you don't think that…

11:12.630 --> 11:16.050
Luis, I don't fully remember
whatever the hell happened last night,

11:16.130 --> 11:17.880
but I did not kill anybody.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.340
I know you didn't kill anyone, my friend.

11:21.590 --> 11:23.220
Because I know who did.

11:26.470 --> 11:29.020
Okay, so those crystals
I was talking about?

11:29.100 --> 11:32.520
Maybe the risk wasn't quite
as low as I led you to believe.

11:33.100 --> 11:36.650
That's why I was hoping
you'd sign up as my man in LA.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.730
To replace the guys who are there now.

11:38.820 --> 11:39.650
Russian guys.

11:39.740 --> 11:42.450
So what are you saying,
these are the guys who killed Benito?

11:42.530 --> 11:43.360
Why?

11:43.450 --> 11:45.490
Because they're Russian mob.

11:45.570 --> 11:48.080
And they knew
Benito was in the scam with me.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.540
I figure they must've hit him
when he left here last night.

11:50.620 --> 11:51.540
So then what?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.290
He came in here looking for help maybe?

11:55.290 --> 11:57.750
Goes to the back room,
collapses, and that's that?

11:58.750 --> 12:00.130
Why would they wanna kill Benito?

12:03.760 --> 12:04.640
Wait a minute.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.010
How much do you owe them?

12:08.350 --> 12:10.270
-Two hundred thousand dollars.
-[sighs]

12:10.350 --> 12:13.270
But I have it. I can pay them,
I was going to pay them.

12:13.350 --> 12:15.060
Okay? I just wanted one more day.

12:15.150 --> 12:17.570
Okay, there was
this horse race this afternoon.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.530
Daniel, I swear. It was a sure thing.

12:19.610 --> 12:22.400
I would've doubled my money,
I could have paid with interest.

12:22.490 --> 12:24.950
I really wanted to believe
that you'd turned things around.

12:25.030 --> 12:28.080
But this has gotta be
the most reckless thing you've ever done!

12:28.160 --> 12:29.410
I can't believe this.

12:29.490 --> 12:31.040
Look, I know I screwed up,

12:31.120 --> 12:35.000
but I didn't think that the Russian mob
in LA was gonna come after me like this!

12:35.080 --> 12:37.170
I'm all the way down here, and I'm police!

12:37.250 --> 12:40.710
Well, then you obviously don't know
how the Russian mob operates, do you?

12:40.800 --> 12:41.920
No.

12:45.010 --> 12:46.720
But you do, don't you?

12:50.510 --> 12:51.350
No.

12:52.180 --> 12:54.520
No way am I getting involved
in this with you, Luis.

12:55.100 --> 12:59.270
The thing for you to do right now is turn
yourself in, tell your people about it.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.400
-They'll protect you.
-Protect me?

13:01.480 --> 13:04.070
Half of my department is
on some gangster's payroll.

13:05.530 --> 13:09.370
Daniel, they'll come after my family.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.540
Maria, little Oscar.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.080
He's three.

13:14.330 --> 13:17.120
I need to stay here
and make sure they're safe.

13:17.750 --> 13:21.130
All I ask is that
you deliver the money that I owe.

13:23.420 --> 13:25.630
Luis, I came down here
for a prisoner transfer.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.220
Exactly. And that's exactly what you do.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.890
You go get her. By the time you come
back, I'll have the money ready for you.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.970
Okay? It's a small detour.

13:34.060 --> 13:35.560
And while you handle that,

13:35.640 --> 13:38.100
then I'll call in poor Benito's murder.

13:40.190 --> 13:41.690
Please, Daniel.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.030
For my family.

13:46.950 --> 13:47.820
[sighs]

13:56.540 --> 13:58.670
So, what's in the box?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.080
Nothing. Stop talking.

14:00.790 --> 14:02.460
Something important, huh?

14:02.550 --> 14:03.960
Maybe not straight-up legal?

14:04.050 --> 14:06.420
I saw that dude's face
when he handed it to you.

14:06.510 --> 14:07.760
Look, can you sit back?

14:08.300 --> 14:11.010
-Sit back, please! Thank you.
-Okay, okay. No problem.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.430
You know, just saying.

14:13.510 --> 14:17.390
You all sweaty, with mysterious boxes.
I know corruption when I see it,

14:17.480 --> 14:20.440
but, you know, none of my business.
We all got our demons.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.940
It's not corrupt, okay?
It's the exact opposite, actually.

14:24.020 --> 14:25.690
-Hmm.
-I'm helping somebody.

14:25.780 --> 14:28.150
-Hmm.
-And I don't have any demons.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.990
Unless you count the fact
I've been working with the Devil

14:31.070 --> 14:34.200
for the last few years, but that's,
you know, out of my control.

14:34.910 --> 14:36.500
Man, I hear you.

14:36.580 --> 14:40.080
I was riding with the devil myself
for a few years, you know. Cocaine?

14:40.170 --> 14:43.460
-That's not what I'm talking--
-You don't have to justify yourself to me.

14:43.540 --> 14:44.550
I feel you. It's hard.

14:44.630 --> 14:46.510
It got a hold of me for a while.

14:46.590 --> 14:51.090
Yeah, I was banging with the X's,
getting up to notorious shit.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.510
And I wasn't proud of it,
so I turned it around.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.970
Oh, right, you turned it around, huh?

14:56.060 --> 14:57.850
Yeah, man, I did.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.390
-And you know what helped me do it?
-What?

15:00.480 --> 15:01.310
God.

15:02.150 --> 15:05.400
He saved me, man,
and I ain't trying to preach to you.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.860
You wanna get out of this?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.240
Find God.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.650
[laughs]

15:10.740 --> 15:12.200
Oh, I found God.

15:13.070 --> 15:15.990
And he exploded my entire body
for sleeping with his wife,

15:16.080 --> 15:18.830
so I don't think
he's quite the guy you think he is.

15:18.910 --> 15:21.330
Whatever. God is whoever you say he is.

15:21.420 --> 15:26.130
And I say that God is someone that
gives me the strength to do better.

15:26.210 --> 15:27.840
And I know I can be better.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.470
Not just for God, but for me.

15:31.590 --> 15:34.050
Look, I hope
this works out for you, I really do.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.390
But you need to be careful, okay?

15:37.010 --> 15:38.720
Because you think you know things,

15:38.810 --> 15:41.270
but then life has
a way of blindsiding you.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.270
[engine revs]

15:54.160 --> 15:56.370
[animals calling]

15:56.450 --> 15:57.910
[Dan groaning]

16:04.540 --> 16:05.380
[grunts]

16:09.340 --> 16:10.300
[seat belt unclips]

16:10.380 --> 16:12.130
[grunts]

16:13.340 --> 16:15.340
[panting]

16:17.350 --> 16:18.720
Huh!

16:24.480 --> 16:25.940
[shouts]

16:26.020 --> 16:28.020
[panting]

16:31.240 --> 16:33.400
Of course it's dead! [huffs]

16:33.490 --> 16:34.570
[car approaches]

16:48.290 --> 16:49.210
Dan?

16:50.130 --> 16:51.090
Espinoza?

16:51.800 --> 16:52.630
Ryan?

16:52.720 --> 16:56.220
Yeah, it's me, Ryan, and Kevin from class.

16:56.970 --> 16:57.800
Hey.

16:57.890 --> 17:01.140
Hey, you know,
we haven't seen you in improv in ages.

17:01.220 --> 17:05.980
We're just driving back from a show
at the El Cerrito Community Center. Yeah.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.310
You know,
you're missing out on a lot of sweet gigs.

17:08.900 --> 17:09.980
Yeah.

17:10.070 --> 17:13.110
Uh, yeah, I've been--
I've been pretty busy lately. [chuckles]

17:13.780 --> 17:14.610
Yeah.

17:15.740 --> 17:16.860
You got a little, uh…

17:17.660 --> 17:19.450
What? Ugh.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.660
-What?
-Oh, yeah.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.410
-Oh, man. 
-Gentle.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.170
[groans] I think it's spray paint.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.630
I was, uh-- I was ambushed by Los X's.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.050
-They're a notorious street gang.
-Oh!

17:33.130 --> 17:35.300
They T-boned my car, tagged it.

17:35.380 --> 17:37.130
My face must have been in the way.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.100
Do you need some help?

17:42.720 --> 17:46.270
Uh, y-yeah.
Actually, you think I can get a ride?

17:46.850 --> 17:49.730
-Yes. And?
-[laughing]

17:49.810 --> 17:52.980
Yes, it's improv 101!

17:53.070 --> 17:54.900
[Ryan and Kevin continue laughing]

17:54.990 --> 17:57.030
-Right. Improv 101.
-[laughs] Oh, God!

17:57.110 --> 17:58.570
-Where do you need to go?
-Oh.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.120
-Just get in the back.
-Yeah.

18:00.200 --> 18:04.040
Jiggle the handle. The belt doesn't work,
so you just gotta yank it hard.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.410
[classical tune playing]

18:06.500 --> 18:08.500
[elevator bell dings]

18:18.340 --> 18:19.340
Daniel!

18:19.430 --> 18:21.600
Fancy seeing you here.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.390
Well, not fancy at all, actually.

18:24.470 --> 18:29.100
You look-- Well, it's hard to tell
sometimes, but you look truly awful.

18:29.690 --> 18:30.810
[sighs]

18:32.060 --> 18:33.400
Lucifer, uh…

18:35.780 --> 18:36.740
[exhales]

18:38.200 --> 18:39.450
I need a favor.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.450
[chuckles]

18:45.950 --> 18:48.620
[laughing]

18:50.620 --> 18:54.750
Really, Daniel, I'd do a spit take,
but this is single malt.

18:54.840 --> 18:56.260
[laughing]

18:56.340 --> 18:58.090
Come on, man. Are you done?

18:58.170 --> 19:01.590
Well, I was until I remembered
the last time you lost a fugitive.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.100
12-year-old girl? You soiling
yourself on that roller coaster?

19:04.180 --> 19:08.140
I didn't soil myself, Lucifer.
And look, this isn't like that, okay?

19:08.930 --> 19:11.270
This girl was rescued by her gang.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.150
And I know their hangout.

19:14.060 --> 19:15.900
It's a bike shop in Van Nuys.

19:16.610 --> 19:19.400
-If we go there, we're gonna find her.
-"We"?

19:19.490 --> 19:22.200
Well, why do you need my help?
You're a police officer.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.660
If you need backup making an arrest,
you have the entire LAPD.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.200
It's not that simple, man.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.370
Los X's didn't just
spring my fugitive, they also…

19:31.670 --> 19:35.710
sort of, stole something from me.
Something that I need to get back.

19:36.300 --> 19:40.920
Oh, so if the police get involved,
the drugs will be confiscated.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.180
It's not drugs!

19:42.840 --> 19:45.850
[sighs] It's money
that an old friend needs me to deliver

19:45.930 --> 19:47.890
so he can get clear
of some dangerous people.

19:47.970 --> 19:51.060
Now it's in the hands of a street gang
who probably don't realize what they have,

19:51.140 --> 19:55.560
and you need to get it back
before they do. Oh, Daniel. [laughs]

19:55.650 --> 19:57.440
This could only happen to you.

19:58.650 --> 20:00.400
Oh, man, I swear.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.620
Sometimes it feels like
the entire universe is against me.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.120
[Lucifer] Oh.

20:06.700 --> 20:07.740
Wait a minute.

20:08.830 --> 20:11.000
You don't think your dad
could be behind this, do you?

20:11.080 --> 20:14.460
[laughs] No. Definitely not.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.460
No.

20:16.540 --> 20:17.920
My father is, um…

20:18.000 --> 20:19.800
Well, I don't exactly know where he is,

20:19.880 --> 20:23.800
but I can guarantee he's dealing
with something much bigger than this.

20:24.380 --> 20:27.350
[exhales] Okay.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.730
So, can you help me?

20:32.560 --> 20:33.890
I mean, you're invincible, right?

20:33.980 --> 20:37.060
You can go in there. You can beat up
the entire gang, and I can grab the box.

20:37.150 --> 20:39.190
I'm not your muscle, Daniel.

20:39.270 --> 20:42.530
I don't just go in
and beat people up like some hired goon.

20:42.610 --> 20:45.700
Look, man, I'm not--
I'm not trying to offend you.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.780
Okay? But there are lives at stake here.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.160
[sighs] I can't do it without you.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.000
Fine.

20:56.250 --> 20:59.710
But we'll do things my way,
no vulgar strong-arm stuff.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.550
-You say they own a bike shop?
-[exhales]

21:01.630 --> 21:04.510
We'll let money do the talking.
And me, of course.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.300
[rap song playing in Spanish]

21:31.410 --> 21:33.410
[shouts, grunts]

21:36.120 --> 21:37.540
[exhales]

21:47.090 --> 21:50.100
[loud clattering]

22:04.650 --> 22:06.700
Hello, gang members.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.450
I understand you sell bikes,

22:08.530 --> 22:11.490
and I would like to purchase
your most expensive one, please.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.200
You wanna buy one of our bikes?

22:16.290 --> 22:17.460
Mm-hmm.

22:20.330 --> 22:23.500
Oh. Oh, I thought you sold motorbikes.

22:23.590 --> 22:25.460
Oh, that's embarrassing.

22:26.050 --> 22:29.840
Well, looks like I'm gonna
have to rethink this entire thing.

22:30.590 --> 22:32.550
Nobody rides motorbikes.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.100
All that noise?

22:34.180 --> 22:36.180
Plus, you get killed on those things.

22:36.270 --> 22:37.140
This is the hype.

22:37.980 --> 22:39.440
Well, wouldn't be the first time

22:39.520 --> 22:42.440
I've spent far too much money
on something I don't know how to use.

22:42.520 --> 22:45.820
Your British ass so fancy
you never learned how to ride a bicycle?

22:45.900 --> 22:49.150
Hey, mija,
not everybody had their pops around

22:49.240 --> 22:51.160
to teach them everything
when they was young.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.240
Don't go making hurtful assumptions.

22:53.990 --> 22:55.620
You don't know this man's story.

22:55.700 --> 23:00.250
[hesitates] Well,
actually, that is my story. To a T.

23:01.460 --> 23:02.500
I feel you.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.050
My old man was never around either.

23:05.130 --> 23:08.420
I'm trying to make better decisions now,
but it's hard, you know?

23:08.510 --> 23:09.880
Never had my role model.

23:11.220 --> 23:12.340
I feel you.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.180
And you, homes. [chuckles]

23:18.770 --> 23:19.940
[creaking]

23:36.830 --> 23:37.950
I mean, it's typical.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.370
I haven't seen him in essentially forever,

23:41.460 --> 23:43.210
and then he turns up out of nowhere

23:43.290 --> 23:46.130
and announces that
he's getting old and he's retiring.

23:46.210 --> 23:49.050
I mean,
what am I supposed to do with that?

23:49.130 --> 23:49.970
[sighs]

23:50.050 --> 23:53.340
Or maybe he wants
to spend time with you, ese.

23:54.050 --> 23:57.760
When my papi retired
from working as a guard up in Pelican Bay,

23:58.350 --> 24:01.980
it was awkward at first, but we actually
got to know each other really well.

24:02.060 --> 24:04.440
Even better than
when I was locked up in there.

24:04.940 --> 24:07.650
Well, my dad was my jailer too.

24:07.730 --> 24:10.440
It's a very specific
kind of pain, isn't it?

24:10.530 --> 24:13.700
And mine had to turn me in
for stealing credit card numbers, homes.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.320
It was my birthday too. [sighs]

24:15.910 --> 24:17.990
Mm-hmm. Right.

24:27.290 --> 24:28.750
That doesn't belong to you.

24:28.840 --> 24:29.710
Hand it over.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.090

You're not a Los X.

24:32.170 --> 24:35.550
Actually, it does belong to me.
Or my-- my friend.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.430
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
I have the gun, give me the box.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.150

No, bro.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.780
I'm correcting one.

25:25.140 --> 25:28.980
So let's stop projecting
and start reflecting.

25:29.060 --> 25:33.440
One thing I've learned in therapy is
that we need to be gentle with ourselves

25:33.530 --> 25:37.110
before we're gentle
with anybody else. Hmm? [kisses]

Nah, that's probably nothing. Come on.

25:44.250 --> 25:46.120
That's not nothing! That's something.

25:46.210 --> 25:48.000
Trucha. Something's going on.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.380
Wait! Let's just give it a minute.
I'm sure it'll be fine. [chuckles]

25:51.460 --> 25:53.380
[Dan] Not a good doggie! Ow! Ow!

25:53.460 --> 25:54.510
Bad dog!

25:54.590 --> 25:56.720
-Bad dog!
-[barking continues]

25:56.800 --> 25:59.140
Hey, that's that cop
that was taking me to jail!

25:59.220 --> 26:03.390
Yes, and unfortunately, he's with me, and
it appears he's gotten what he came for,

26:03.470 --> 26:05.480
so we'll be off, thank you very much.

26:06.060 --> 26:07.560
We were having a moment, homes.

26:07.640 --> 26:10.860
And it was a sincere moment.
We shared, and we bonded, didn't we?

26:10.940 --> 26:13.730
So we're all friends now.
There's no need for us to fight.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.990
Uh… oh, dear.

26:16.070 --> 26:17.650
Dan, go.

26:17.740 --> 26:20.450
If this really is an emergency,
I'll take care of them.

26:20.530 --> 26:23.370
[panting] Right.
Give me your keys. I need your keys.

26:23.450 --> 26:26.450
There's no way in the world
I'm letting you drive my car, Daniel.

26:26.540 --> 26:27.370
What am I to do?

26:27.460 --> 26:28.870
-Use your imagination.
-What?

26:28.960 --> 26:31.330
You think you're gonna
take on all of us solo?

26:32.170 --> 26:33.960
Unfortunately, yes.

He kept the books for me,
and he betrayed me.

He was secretly working
with the Russians for months.

You need to adjust that attitude, Danimal,
because I'm not done with you yet.

28:53.060 --> 28:56.440
I had a perfectly good plan
to throw the Russians into chaos,

28:56.520 --> 28:59.020
and you had to screw up
and lose that head.

28:59.110 --> 29:01.070

But it got stolen from you. Remember?

And when I heard,
I sent my man Vargas to recover it,

29:09.330 --> 29:11.950
and then he runs into you
at the bike shop,

29:12.040 --> 29:14.210

That's your guy?

Apology accepted.

29:22.380 --> 29:23.670
Small thing, though.

I also tasked Vargas
with a hit on the Russians' bookkeeper.

since they made me kill mine.

29:31.100 --> 29:32.270

is turn yourself in, Luis.

I can't believe how far gone you are.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.910

30:19.440 --> 30:21.940
Do I look like a man who's not for real?

30:23.820 --> 30:25.990
You have ten hours to kill the bookkeeper.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.410
-Cool.
-Hmm.

31:12.490 --> 31:15.290
Listen, um, so I have this case…

31:16.040 --> 31:20.210
where I think, uh, someone
might have actually faked a murder.

31:20.290 --> 31:22.830
And it got me thinking,
how would you do that?

31:22.920 --> 31:25.630
You mean, how could you
tell if a murder was faked?

31:25.710 --> 31:27.380
Yeah… Uh…

31:27.460 --> 31:29.090
No, uh, what--

31:29.170 --> 31:33.640
um, I wanna-- I wanna
get inside the head of the criminal.

31:33.720 --> 31:37.970
Really figure out what it would take
to pull something like this off.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.560
It's pretty crucial.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.560
For the case.

31:41.640 --> 31:45.020
Okay, well, maybe I can look at the file?

31:46.150 --> 31:47.980
[hesitates] Look, here's the thing.

31:49.780 --> 31:54.370
You are the best forensic scientist
I have ever worked with.

31:55.070 --> 31:57.160
I mean,
you're probably the best in the city.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.290
So I was thinking, if anyone
could figure this out, it would be you.

32:01.000 --> 32:01.910
Okay.

32:02.500 --> 32:03.670
Real talk now.

32:04.630 --> 32:05.960
No more bull crud.

32:08.300 --> 32:11.550
I actually do know how
to fake the perfect murder.

32:12.340 --> 32:13.380
Because…

32:15.970 --> 32:18.560
I've been working on it for my novel.

32:19.060 --> 32:21.520
Aren't you-- oh! Oh!

32:21.600 --> 32:23.850
That's-- that's great.
-I know. I know, right?

32:23.940 --> 32:27.360
So, it's about a forensic scientist
who talks to ghosts.

32:27.440 --> 32:31.820
Right? But I had to confront her
with an almost impossible puzzle,

32:31.900 --> 32:35.070
because she herself
is an impossible puzzle.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.990
She's super cheerful, but really tortured.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.160
Totally transparent, but full of secrets.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.210
So what about the, uh, the murder?

32:42.290 --> 32:44.040
Oh, right.

32:44.120 --> 32:47.750
So, what I came up with is pretty awesome.

32:47.840 --> 32:51.710
Almost foolproof, but ugh!
It is really hard.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.970
I mean, you would have
to arrange the crime scene just right.

32:56.050 --> 32:59.560
Could you pull it off in,
say, nine and a half hours?

32:59.640 --> 33:02.520
That's oddly specific, but let me see.

33:02.600 --> 33:05.650
That would take about, uh…
Two hours and you add another one…

33:05.730 --> 33:07.020
A two and…

33:07.110 --> 33:08.560
-Ella!
-One second.

33:08.650 --> 33:13.070
Yep, yep, you should be able to do it,
but you would need to move it outdoors.

33:13.150 --> 33:16.070
Which means wrapping up your footwear
in a specific kind of slipper.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.620
Yeah, hold on, just one second.

33:17.700 --> 33:20.490

but I'm not on official business.

give me everything I need.

34:32.190 --> 34:35.690

but I can explain everything.

I am near Lake Arrowhead,
about 80 miles east of LA.

and smoke coming out of the chimney.

maybe, like, 100 yards south of a pond.

There's a lot of buildings in this area
that match that description.

Oh, this? Yeah.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.550
It's-- it's a long story.
Don't worry about it.

36:18.210 --> 36:20.970
-[sighs]
-Dan, I'm your friend.

36:22.010 --> 36:24.140
I'm also an angel. I can help.

36:24.220 --> 36:25.430
I-- I…

36:26.350 --> 36:28.470
Look, I-- [sighs] Look, I'm so sorry, man.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.180
I really appreciate your help,
but you know what?

36:31.270 --> 36:32.230
I can figure it out.

36:32.310 --> 36:36.270
Hmm. Listen, if you didn't want my help,
why did you call me here?

36:36.360 --> 36:37.230
I do.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.730
I do. I need some help.

36:38.820 --> 36:42.320
All right, somebody stole my car,
and they stranded me here and then…

36:42.400 --> 36:44.950
[panting]

36:45.990 --> 36:47.870
[breathes deeply]

36:47.950 --> 36:48.950
Dan.

36:50.490 --> 36:51.580
I'm not an Uber.

36:52.160 --> 36:53.080
I know.

36:53.790 --> 36:57.170
I know, and I wouldn't call you
if I had any other choice.

36:57.250 --> 37:00.380
But right now
I'm 100 miles away from home,

37:00.460 --> 37:02.840
and I need to get back
as soon as possible.

37:04.220 --> 37:05.050
Please.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.140
[Amenadiel sighs]

37:11.100 --> 37:13.350
[sighs] Okay.

37:13.430 --> 37:14.600
So how does this work?

37:14.690 --> 37:17.610
Do, uh-- You gonna pick me up,
or do I sort of climb on?

37:18.560 --> 37:19.480
Okay.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.320
Oh!

37:22.110 --> 37:25.320
Okay, so just so you know, I may pass out.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.490
Or puke.

37:27.660 --> 37:28.490
Or both.

37:30.530 --> 37:32.120
-[exhales]
-Okay, I'm ready.

37:35.040 --> 37:38.420
Uh, yeah. I'm trying to reach the head
of the chemistry department at UCLA.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.630
I have a question about a substance
called "ayquina." It's something--

37:41.710 --> 37:43.380
-What's up, Dan?
-[gasps]

37:43.460 --> 37:45.380
Maze! [panting]

37:45.470 --> 37:47.180
What the hell are you doing here?

37:49.100 --> 37:51.720
Well, I'm not really talking
to Lucifer right now,

37:51.810 --> 37:55.390
but I did overhear him saying that
you were spinning out of control. So…

37:56.640 --> 37:58.270
I had to come see that for myself.

37:58.350 --> 38:00.730
[both laugh]

38:01.820 --> 38:03.440
[sobs]

38:04.030 --> 38:04.940
You okay?

38:06.950 --> 38:08.780
Do I look okay, Maze?

38:08.860 --> 38:12.370
I'm having the worst day of my life.
I feel like I'm losing my mind,

38:12.450 --> 38:16.120
and I've had, like, three concussions
in six hours. That can't help!

38:16.830 --> 38:17.920
[exhales]

38:19.750 --> 38:21.500
[Mazikeen sighs]

38:23.500 --> 38:26.170
So, tell me about it.

38:28.010 --> 38:28.840
No.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.600
Amenadiel asked me the same thing,
and I can't get you guys involved.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.140
Amenadiel?

38:34.220 --> 38:36.180
God's greatest goody-two-shoes?

38:36.270 --> 38:37.850
Come on, Dan!

38:37.940 --> 38:39.020
I'm a demon.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.520
You think there's something
you can't tell me?

38:42.360 --> 38:46.070
-We killed a guy together.
-For the last time, we didn't kill a guy.

38:46.150 --> 38:48.030
We made sure some
dangerous people found him.

38:48.110 --> 38:50.320
Yeah, yeah, blah-blah-blah. Point is,

38:51.740 --> 38:52.660
this is me.

38:53.950 --> 38:55.450
No secrets.

38:57.620 --> 38:58.460
Fine.

38:59.620 --> 39:01.830
But you gotta promise
you're not gonna laugh.

39:04.630 --> 39:07.720
[laughing]

39:07.800 --> 39:10.590
Come on, Maze. [exhales]

39:10.680 --> 39:13.430
I can't believe Amenadiel carried you.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.680
In his arms.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.520
Like a little baby.

39:18.600 --> 39:20.690
[laughing]

39:20.770 --> 39:21.980
Oh, what?

39:22.060 --> 39:25.900
Come on, you gotta have
a sense of humor about these things.

39:25.980 --> 39:29.280
I've only got six hours
to figure out how to live past tonight

39:29.360 --> 39:31.740
and get out from under Luis' thumb,
even if I do survive.

39:31.820 --> 39:34.410
So please excuse me, Maze,
if I don't find that hilarious.

39:34.490 --> 39:36.830
Oh, God, you're such a dumbass.

39:37.410 --> 39:38.910
Just set up a meet with Luis,

39:39.000 --> 39:41.960
get your antidote,
and serve him up to the Russians.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.710
Duh, we've done this before.

39:43.790 --> 39:45.840
I can't get the antidote
without showing proof

39:45.920 --> 39:48.210
that I actually killed
the Russian bookkeeper, so…

39:48.300 --> 39:50.930
Well, that's easy. I can get you
proof of death, no problem.

39:51.010 --> 39:53.510
Come on,
you can't actually kill her, Maze.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.510
Fine.

39:57.310 --> 39:58.970
I'll whip something up.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.310
First I'll get in touch
with my Russian contacts.

40:01.390 --> 40:04.190
Then I'll set up a meet
with you and them to explain the deal.

40:04.270 --> 40:07.400
Then you set up
a meeting with Luis tonight,

40:07.480 --> 40:09.400
with the Russians lying in wait.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.700
-[snaps fingers]
-I'll get you your proof.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.320
Sure.

40:13.410 --> 40:16.950
Easy. Just follow a plan whipped up
spur-of-the-moment by a demon

40:17.030 --> 40:19.450
to deliver a psychopath
to a bunch of murderers,

40:19.950 --> 40:22.250
after I scam him
into saving my life. [chuckles]

40:22.330 --> 40:24.040
It'll work perfectly.

40:24.130 --> 40:25.920
Just don't screw it up.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.260
Also, I'm telling the Russians
your name is Joe Stone.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.380
Why Joe Stone?

40:32.130 --> 40:34.590
Because Dan Espinoza sounds like a cop.

40:35.180 --> 40:36.600
Joe Stone sounds cool.

40:37.640 --> 40:40.640
You need to be… cool with these people.

40:41.930 --> 40:42.980
Hey, Maze.

40:44.480 --> 40:45.480
Thank you.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.480
I'm sorry about the demon stuff.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.990
It means a lot you're helping me.

40:52.610 --> 40:54.820
I'm only helping you because it's you.

40:55.910 --> 40:56.870
[exhales]

41:08.960 --> 41:12.550
So that's the play.
You hide out on the balcony.

41:13.220 --> 41:15.630
Once I've conducted my business with Luis…

41:16.760 --> 41:18.180
then you swoop in and take him.

41:20.310 --> 41:21.640
Play sounds good.

41:25.440 --> 41:29.440
But we don't know
who the hell you are, Mr. Joe Stone.

41:33.990 --> 41:34.860
[sighs]

41:35.650 --> 41:38.620
But Mazikeen says you're okay, so…

41:38.700 --> 41:39.660
[Linda] Dan?

41:42.200 --> 41:43.040
Hi, Dan.

41:44.870 --> 41:45.710
[man] Dan?

41:45.790 --> 41:47.080
Who is Dan?

41:49.590 --> 41:51.300
You are Joe Stone, right?

41:51.380 --> 41:52.340
Yeah.

41:52.420 --> 41:54.340
Uh, gentlemen, I just need…

41:56.010 --> 41:57.760
one minute. [clears throat]

42:00.300 --> 42:02.640
Linda, what the hell are you doing here?

42:02.720 --> 42:06.270
Oh, I have lunch here every Tuesday.
I mean, the pierogis, right? Okay.

42:06.350 --> 42:09.440
Are you okay?
Your-- your eyes are bulging.

42:09.520 --> 42:10.650
I need you to hit me.

42:11.610 --> 42:13.400
Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but--

42:13.480 --> 42:15.490
[grunts]

42:16.860 --> 42:18.450
-You're undercover, right?
-Yes.

42:18.530 --> 42:19.450
Don't laugh.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.620
I'll explain everything later.

42:22.700 --> 42:23.580
Okay.

42:25.000 --> 42:25.830
[exhales]

42:28.580 --> 42:30.960
My side piece. [chuckles]

42:31.040 --> 42:33.050
I never give her my real name, right?

42:33.130 --> 42:34.340
I mean, you can see why.

42:35.550 --> 42:36.380
Cuckoo.

42:40.260 --> 42:41.600
[chuckles]

42:44.970 --> 42:46.770
That's for what you did to me.

42:51.270 --> 42:53.480
Mistresses are like KGB.

42:54.230 --> 42:56.610
Meddle in everything, torture you forever.

42:57.950 --> 43:00.740
[chuckles] I like you, Joe Stone.

43:03.740 --> 43:05.450
See you at club tonight.

43:06.410 --> 43:07.450
[snorts]

43:13.590 --> 43:14.750
So how do I look?

43:15.960 --> 43:17.670
Pretty good, actually.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.050
Yeah. I feel pretty good too, man.

43:21.640 --> 43:25.430
I closed Lux for a private party,
and your guests should arrive shortly.

43:26.020 --> 43:27.270
Everything's in place.

43:27.350 --> 43:29.060
We're gonna pull this off, right?

43:29.640 --> 43:31.690
Oh, Daniel.

43:31.770 --> 43:36.480
I never lie, and I promise you
the plan is gonna work perfectly.

43:36.570 --> 43:38.190
-[Dan chuckles]
-[glasses clink]

43:38.280 --> 43:40.740
I really appreciate you
having my back out there.

43:41.490 --> 43:43.200
Oh, no, I'm not gonna be there.

43:44.620 --> 43:45.780
[gulps] You what?

43:45.870 --> 43:47.620
Well, I have history with the Russians.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.830
Trust me,
this won't work properly if I'm there.

43:49.910 --> 43:52.040
Yeah, but I don't have
any backup down there.

43:52.120 --> 43:55.130
Maze isn't gonna be there for a while.
If things get hairy, what do I do?

43:55.210 --> 43:58.300
Daniel, I realize
this is your first crime-boss summit,

43:58.380 --> 44:00.220
so you'll have to take my word for it,

44:00.300 --> 44:02.090
but there won't be any actual violence.

44:02.180 --> 44:05.180
It's all about appearances,
hence why I insisted on the suit.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.350
And as for backup,

44:07.430 --> 44:09.680
all you need are people who can act tough,

44:09.770 --> 44:14.610
and I think I have found
exactly the right guys.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.570
[Dan huffs]

44:17.650 --> 44:18.900
You've got this!

44:19.740 --> 44:20.690
All over it.

44:22.070 --> 44:22.910
Right.

44:36.670 --> 44:39.050
-[Ryan] Hey, Dan.
-[sighs]

44:39.130 --> 44:41.510
How about this place, right?

44:41.590 --> 44:45.300
-Ryan, what are you guys doing here?
-Lucifer said you needed us for a gig.

44:45.390 --> 44:47.600
What, uh-- How? When?

44:47.680 --> 44:50.100
After we dropped you off,
we stuck around for drinks.

44:50.180 --> 44:51.390
Networking, you know.

44:51.480 --> 44:54.520
He said he could book us some gigs,
and then three hours later,

44:54.600 --> 44:56.940
boom-shaka-laka! He's a cool guy.

44:57.020 --> 44:59.150
I don't think you understand what this is.

44:59.230 --> 45:03.360
No, no, no. We got it. We just gotta be
your backup. Stand around, look tough.

45:03.450 --> 45:06.410
-[clears throat]
-Oh, yeah, everybody came prepared.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.950
[huffs] No. No!

45:10.040 --> 45:10.950
That is a rental.

45:11.040 --> 45:12.410
It is way too dangerous.

45:13.000 --> 45:17.670
So, Danimal, are we gonna do this or what?

45:21.420 --> 45:22.260
Yes.

45:23.550 --> 45:24.430
And…

45:25.760 --> 45:27.090
this is my crew.

45:27.180 --> 45:29.010
Showing up with your own crew?

45:30.640 --> 45:33.180
Power move. I'm impressed.

45:33.890 --> 45:35.020
Yeah.

45:35.100 --> 45:36.230
Yeah, hell, yeah.

45:37.190 --> 45:38.980
Look, let's just get to this, okay?

45:39.060 --> 45:41.730
Where's the antidote?
I don't have a lot of time here.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.610
Where is my proof?

45:46.860 --> 45:48.120
It's on its way.

45:48.820 --> 45:49.950
It'll be here.

45:50.030 --> 45:51.290
Soon, I hope.

45:51.990 --> 45:53.950
Are you starting to get the sweats yet?

45:55.370 --> 45:56.960
That's how it starts.

45:57.040 --> 46:00.920
Hey, you best recognize
when you talk to my boy Dan.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.210
Don't test me.

46:02.300 --> 46:04.340
Prison changed me.

46:04.920 --> 46:06.260
Yeah, Ryan, Ryan, chill.

46:06.340 --> 46:09.340
You better put
a leash on that dog, Danimal,

46:09.430 --> 46:11.640
because I'll walk out of here right now.

46:11.720 --> 46:14.730
-[Mazikeen] Then you'd miss all the fun.
-[Svetlana gasping]

46:14.810 --> 46:16.390
Oh, Maze, what the hell?

46:17.060 --> 46:18.440
You had one job.

46:18.520 --> 46:19.610
I know.

46:20.770 --> 46:24.030
I know I was supposed to bring proof.

46:25.190 --> 46:28.660
But proof can be faked.

46:29.700 --> 46:32.200
Don't freak out, I'm not gonna kill her.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.330
He can.

46:35.410 --> 46:39.250
What better way for him to be sure
she's dead so you can get your antidote.

46:39.330 --> 46:43.550
-Maze, this is not what we talked about.
-No one is going to kill Svetlana.

46:43.630 --> 46:47.170
[guns cocking]

46:47.260 --> 46:50.430
You sold me out. Now you're
not getting the antidote, Danimal.

46:51.390 --> 46:52.220
"Danimal"?

46:52.930 --> 46:57.770
So you have been lying
to us all along, Joe Stone.

47:00.150 --> 47:02.560
All right, everybody,
just take a breath, all right?

47:02.650 --> 47:06.030
This has gotten completely nuts! [panting]

47:06.110 --> 47:08.450
I have no idea how we got here.

47:11.740 --> 47:15.120
None of this makes any sense.
It's like one crazy thing after another.

47:15.620 --> 47:16.660
[huffs]

47:19.370 --> 47:21.460
But we have the power to stop this.

47:22.920 --> 47:23.880
Right now.

47:25.670 --> 47:26.590
Look…

47:27.550 --> 47:29.880
I know it can seem
like things just happen,

47:29.970 --> 47:32.180
and that we don't have
any control over them.

47:32.260 --> 47:35.720
Like, like there's no order,
or-- or meaning.

47:37.350 --> 47:39.690
But if the world is senseless and random,

47:40.730 --> 47:44.650
well, then all we can do is just
what we think is best. [panting]

47:44.730 --> 47:50.570
And there is no way anybody thinks
it's best if we all die here today.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.530
Right?
