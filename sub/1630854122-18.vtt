WEBVTT

01:14.833 --> 01:16.317
And stop trying to--

01:37.511 --> 01:38.822
Cheers.

01:38.822 --> 01:40.134
We have his photo out everywhere.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.840
Budapest.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.547
- Did it?
- Yeah.

03:57.547 --> 04:00.240
Cam, happy belated.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.931
Maya.

04:04.658 --> 04:06.556
No way!

04:06.556 --> 04:07.937
As soon
as the weather warms up.

04:07.937 --> 04:09.628
It's run
by a former stuntwoman here.

04:09.628 --> 04:11.009
I thought it was a massage.

04:11.009 --> 04:14.046
Advanced motorcycle course?
Brilliant.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.256
You'll never get a course
like this in the States.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.154
The regulations
are damn near irresponsible.

04:18.154 --> 04:19.604
It's dope.

04:19.604 --> 04:21.261
It's crazy thoughtful.
Thank you.

04:26.127 --> 04:29.786
You know, when one of us
starts dating someone new,

04:29.786 --> 04:32.720
we can get a little protective.

04:34.170 --> 04:36.241
But you,

04:36.241 --> 04:38.657
you're exactly
what Raines needs.

04:38.657 --> 04:41.384
I'll drink to that.

04:41.384 --> 04:44.284
So how exactly
did you find this stunt course?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.458
It's so random,
now that I think about it.

04:46.458 --> 04:49.081
We had this Australian guy
who kept coming into Zizi's.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.980
All the regulars knew him.

04:50.980 --> 04:52.878
And he had this insane tattoo

04:52.878 --> 04:54.294
I kept noticing
literally every time...

05:16.902 --> 05:18.387
The answer is darkness.

05:18.387 --> 05:20.699
What is it with you Langley
guys and these riddles?

05:20.699 --> 05:22.218
Your presence is requested.

05:22.218 --> 05:24.979
Tell your partner relax.
We're not going far.

05:35.714 --> 05:37.578
Make sure your phone is off.

06:01.844 --> 06:03.915
I'll let you catch up.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.096
- Scott Forrester.
- Pavel Novikoff.

06:13.096 --> 06:15.202
It's been a while.
- Since Croatia.

06:15.202 --> 06:18.170
- Shouldn't you be stateside?
- I still am, on paper.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.346
You know, we pulled a lot
of strings to get you asylum.

06:21.346 --> 06:23.486
Guy with your clearance
betraying the motherland?

06:23.486 --> 06:25.488
You are high up
on Russia's hit list.

06:25.488 --> 06:28.560
Well, I'm not here
because I missed the goulash.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.391
Trust me when I say this is
important--life or death.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.395
What I'm about to share
is highly sensitive.

06:36.223 --> 06:39.847
Does the name of
Vladislav Pavlovic ring a bell?

06:39.847 --> 06:41.918
Yeah.

06:41.918 --> 06:43.817
We traded a ballerina
getting her big break

06:43.817 --> 06:46.544
for Vlad getting 50 years.

06:46.544 --> 06:48.753
But I can see on your face
something's changed.

06:48.753 --> 06:51.825
Apparently he caught wind
about an imminent transfer

06:51.825 --> 06:53.551
to maximum security.

06:53.551 --> 06:57.624
Five days ago, there was
a prison break in Omsk.

06:57.624 --> 06:59.073
Vlad's out.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.145
And you think
he's coming to Budapest?

07:02.145 --> 07:04.113
Yeah, it seems like when
you took his brother's life,

07:04.113 --> 07:05.701
you made yourself a target.

07:05.701 --> 07:07.012
It's not like I had a choice.

07:07.012 --> 07:08.186
There was only one of us
walking out of there.

07:08.186 --> 07:09.532
What threat level
are we talking here?

07:09.532 --> 07:12.362
The highest. This is
a vendetta, a blood feud.

07:12.362 --> 07:14.399
Vlad has dozens of bodies
to his name,

07:14.399 --> 07:17.402
and he's just sprung from a
Siberian prison to get to you.

07:17.402 --> 07:19.059
Clawing one's way out
of Russia.

07:19.059 --> 07:20.336
That's a lot of ground
to cover.

07:20.336 --> 07:22.338
Dominoes are already falling.

07:22.338 --> 07:25.341
A Jeep was found
on an airstrip outside Omsk--

07:25.341 --> 07:27.032
dead pilot inside.

07:27.032 --> 07:29.932
They've hijacked his plane.
- They?

07:29.932 --> 07:32.831
We believe
Vlad has an accomplice.

07:32.831 --> 07:35.351
I appreciate the heads-up
and you coming all this way,

07:35.351 --> 07:36.697
but my team
can take it from here.

07:36.697 --> 07:39.320
This intel I've offered up,

07:39.320 --> 07:41.599
you'd never hear it
from official channels.

07:41.599 --> 07:43.393
It's not safe
for you in Budapest.

07:43.393 --> 07:45.499
I'm alive today because
of the American government.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.638
Because of you, Scott.

07:46.638 --> 07:48.398
Let me repay the debt.

07:48.398 --> 07:50.884
I'm already here,
and like it or not,

07:50.884 --> 07:52.955
you're on the edge
of a precipice.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.613
You're signing off on this?

07:55.613 --> 07:59.133
No, I'm just a sucker
for the jet lag.

07:59.133 --> 08:01.204
Try to keep our asset
in one piece.

08:04.173 --> 08:05.933
Vladislav Pavlovic.

08:05.933 --> 08:07.521
Blue-chip contract killer
who operated

08:07.521 --> 08:10.144
out of Moscow,
St. Petersburg, and Minsk.

08:10.144 --> 08:12.595
43 confirmed kills to his name,

08:12.595 --> 08:16.634
including a CIA case officer,
Michael Rafferty.

08:16.634 --> 08:19.257
Now, Vlad was on deck to serve
his official sentence

08:19.257 --> 08:22.018
in an Omsk supermax,
but clearly he had other plans.

08:22.018 --> 08:25.401
Piotr Efremov's dodging me.
Not a single call returned.

08:25.401 --> 08:28.300
The deal we made was
for Vlad to stay shackled.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.199
We're short by about 50 years.

08:30.199 --> 08:32.753
- What about Vlad's accomplice?
- Sergei Diatchenko.

08:32.753 --> 08:35.411
He's a corrections officer
at the prison.

08:35.411 --> 08:37.689
Now, we found that he had
no prior connection to Vlad,

08:37.689 --> 08:40.140
so the two must have met
when he transferred there.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.591
And so far, his criminal record
came up empty.

08:42.591 --> 08:45.110
We've recently confirmed
a twin-engine plane

08:45.110 --> 08:47.423
was found ditched
in a Turkish airfield.

08:47.423 --> 08:49.459
Tail number proves
it's Russian,

08:49.459 --> 08:52.048
linked to the dead pilot
they found in Omsk.

08:52.048 --> 08:54.257
Meaning Vlad
is officially out of Siberia.

08:55.362 --> 08:56.536
Put out a Red Notice.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.813
If he's inching this way,

08:57.813 --> 09:00.056
I want every cop in Europe
to know about it.

09:01.782 --> 09:04.060
Hey, we've got to get you out
of the country.

09:04.060 --> 09:05.268
I'm not hiding.

09:05.268 --> 09:06.753
Sorry, Scott.
It's protocol.

09:06.753 --> 09:10.066
Me leaving Budapest,
it is not gonna stop this guy.

09:10.066 --> 09:12.068
If I run, it only is
gonna put more bodies

09:12.068 --> 09:13.414
between me and Vlad.

09:13.414 --> 09:15.416
You want to stay local, fine,

09:15.416 --> 09:17.349
but we're implementing
some safety measures.

09:26.669 --> 09:28.015
You'll be safe here.

09:28.015 --> 09:30.155
RSO hooked it up.

09:30.155 --> 09:32.054
The building
was recently renovated,

09:32.054 --> 09:33.262
and there's cameras out front.

09:33.262 --> 09:34.470
Vo has agreed
to the night shift.

09:34.470 --> 09:36.058
Kellett,
I've got to be honest,

09:36.058 --> 09:38.750
this whole thing
feels overblown.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.338
Scott, you've been marked,

09:40.338 --> 09:42.340
and the threat
is more than credible.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.480
A safe house is
the bare minimum.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.275
Our pal, Novikoff,
he's pretty convinced

09:46.275 --> 09:48.070
that Vlad
is not gonna let this go.

09:48.070 --> 09:50.037
Novikoff is the other reason
I'm on edge.

09:50.037 --> 09:51.487
I mean,
he is a spy who defected.

09:51.487 --> 09:53.075
Can we really trust this guy?

09:53.075 --> 09:56.250
My mother did, and he's given
me no reason to doubt him.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.907
I thought he was
a high-priority asset.

09:57.907 --> 10:00.669
Why would the CIA send him over
in person for this?

10:00.669 --> 10:02.394
And why is all of it
off the record?

10:02.394 --> 10:05.052
I--

10:05.052 --> 10:06.398
Yeah?

10:06.398 --> 10:08.677
Novikoff's back channels
came through.

10:08.677 --> 10:10.368
We got a line
on Sergei's phone.

10:10.368 --> 10:12.059
Service is tied
to a Russian provider,

10:12.059 --> 10:14.406
but we can track his signal
with the cell towers here.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.891
Hey, you got your laptop
near you?

10:15.891 --> 10:17.582
- Yeah.
<i>- Stand by.</i>

10:25.314 --> 10:26.591
- All right, got it.
<i>- All right.</i>

10:26.591 --> 10:28.110
<i>Now you're seeing
what we're seeing.</i>

10:28.110 --> 10:30.215
Sergei's been using
his phone in short bursts

10:30.215 --> 10:31.838
ever since they landed
in Turkey.

10:31.838 --> 10:34.703
You're looking at every tower
hit over the last 48 hours.

10:34.703 --> 10:36.670
His phone is only on
for a few minutes at a time,

10:36.670 --> 10:38.810
<i>but it's enough
to track the position</i>

10:38.810 --> 10:40.536
<i>and frequency
of these triangulations.</i>

10:45.334 --> 10:47.819
Check out these timestamps.

10:47.819 --> 10:50.063
Sergei's really legging it.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.860
He's on a moving train.
Smitty, get the HNP mobilized.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.344
<i>If Sergei is here,</i>

10:55.344 --> 10:56.241
<i>there's still good chance
Vlad is with him.</i>

10:56.241 --> 10:57.449
ID that train.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.796
We intercept at the next stop.

11:02.316 --> 11:04.180
It's the N-40 out of Sofia.

11:04.180 --> 11:08.771
Last phone hit
was near Szeged an hour ago.

11:08.771 --> 11:10.255
Train's already in Hungary.

11:10.255 --> 11:12.499
He's coming right for you.

11:12.499 --> 11:13.500
Take him.

11:41.666 --> 11:43.185
All right.
Clear the way.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.155
Hey, stay in your seat.

11:48.155 --> 11:50.295
It's all right.
- Stay calm.

12:01.444 --> 12:02.998
Oh, no! No, please!
Please don't shoot!

12:02.998 --> 12:04.102
Don't shoot.
- Where is he?

12:04.102 --> 12:05.207
Where's Vlad?
- I don't know.

12:05.207 --> 12:06.795
He--he left me.

12:12.145 --> 12:13.767
Guys.

12:37.687 --> 12:39.241
- Forrester.
<i>- What is it?</i>

12:39.241 --> 12:41.277
We lost Vlad.
He's off the train.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.598
Four dead bodies
at the prison,

12:51.598 --> 12:52.875
one on the airstrip.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.463
Guy on the train makes six.

12:54.463 --> 12:55.913
You and Vlad have been busy.

12:57.431 --> 12:59.192
Please, my phone.

12:59.192 --> 13:01.090
I need my phone!

13:01.090 --> 13:02.436
Why?

13:02.436 --> 13:04.266
So you can check in
with your co-conspirator?

13:04.266 --> 13:07.200
We know you linked up with
Vlad while he was behind bars.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.718
What's the nature
of your relationship?

13:08.718 --> 13:09.823
Relationship?

13:09.823 --> 13:11.825
I was nothing.
A servant.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.447
Whatever he needed inside,
I would get--

13:13.447 --> 13:14.794
phone calls, packages.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.036
I'm in his pocket, you see?

13:16.036 --> 13:17.727
- He paying you?
- No.

13:17.727 --> 13:19.005
Raines.

13:21.455 --> 13:23.492
Yuri and Alexei.

13:23.492 --> 13:24.804
My boys.

13:27.772 --> 13:30.292
There is a man in Omsk.

13:30.292 --> 13:33.053
I'm told he has no family,
no home.

13:33.053 --> 13:35.815
He is a killer,
watching my sons,

13:35.815 --> 13:39.059
and he waits on an order
from Vladislav.

13:39.059 --> 13:40.992
I had no choice
but to cooperate.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.718
So you helped him
escape under duress?

13:42.718 --> 13:45.928
I did what any father would
do to keep his children alive!

13:45.928 --> 13:47.136
How did you two
make it this far?

13:47.136 --> 13:49.035
He arranged for everything.

13:49.035 --> 13:50.899
A stolen plane
got us to Ankara.

13:50.899 --> 13:53.004
From there, forged documents
put us on trains.

13:53.004 --> 13:55.110
Yeah, so Vlad needed you
to smuggle him

13:55.110 --> 13:57.215
through every checkpoint
that you set up.

13:57.215 --> 13:58.872
It's the only reason
I'm still breathing.

13:58.872 --> 14:01.599
As soon as we got to Budapest,
he had no more use for me.

14:01.599 --> 14:04.360
Yeah, he must have
some refuge here in Budapest.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.121
He been in contact with anyone?

14:06.121 --> 14:09.089
I swear, if I knew anything,
I would tell you.

14:09.089 --> 14:11.574
You were basically
his hostage for five days.

14:11.574 --> 14:12.886
He must have said something.

14:12.886 --> 14:14.474
Most men,
when they leave prison cell,

14:14.474 --> 14:15.889
they want three things:

14:15.889 --> 14:19.617
a bottle of vodka, a woman,
and a warm beach.

14:19.617 --> 14:21.550
Not Vladislav.

14:21.550 --> 14:23.621
Something else consumes him.

14:23.621 --> 14:25.623
There is no reasoning with him.

14:25.623 --> 14:28.868
And now that he's gone, there
is no telling what he will do.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.076
Please!

14:30.076 --> 14:33.079
I need to know my sons are OK!

14:38.705 --> 14:40.120
Keep it on speaker.

15:01.038 --> 15:02.556
Yuri?

15:48.085 --> 15:49.845
Sergei is just a cog in this.

15:49.845 --> 15:53.090
Vlad never divulged anything
about his agenda in Budapest.

15:53.090 --> 15:54.677
We'll keep him in custody
for now,

15:54.677 --> 15:56.334
but we are back to square one.

15:56.334 --> 15:58.854
At least Sergei's kids
appear to be safe.

15:58.854 --> 16:02.168
Maybe the fact they're brothers
garnered sympathy from Vlad.

16:02.168 --> 16:05.171
The guard was a stepping
stone to get him here.

16:05.171 --> 16:06.551
Now Vlad wants the trophy,

16:06.551 --> 16:09.106
but he won't strike
at Forrester right away.

16:09.106 --> 16:11.108
The way some predators
taunt their prey,

16:11.108 --> 16:12.833
tiring them out first.

16:12.833 --> 16:14.007
What, like a game?

16:14.007 --> 16:16.320
A hunt.
Big difference.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.633
Vlad's been living with his
brother's death for some time.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.566
A plan's in motion.

16:21.566 --> 16:23.396
If he gets to Forrester,

16:23.396 --> 16:26.019
nothing about it will be swift.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.262
Now that he's made it
back to the city,

16:27.262 --> 16:28.677
where do you think he's going?

16:28.677 --> 16:30.023
Being blacklisted by Russia,

16:30.023 --> 16:32.232
his remaining allies
will quickly disappear.

16:32.232 --> 16:34.959
But there's one group
he could still go to.

16:34.959 --> 16:37.375
The Bratva.
The Russian mob.

16:37.375 --> 16:41.414
If Vlad has any favors
to cash in, it'd be with them.

16:41.414 --> 16:43.209
They have an outfit here
in Budapest.

16:43.209 --> 16:45.176
Even if that was our way
to get to Vlad,

16:45.176 --> 16:47.213
the mob prides itself
on a code.

16:47.213 --> 16:48.973
There's no way in hell
they'll talk to us.

16:48.973 --> 16:51.113
It would have to be
one of their own.

16:57.395 --> 16:59.432
Forrester.
- Hey, what's going on?

16:59.432 --> 17:01.227
When you first started out
in Budapest,

17:01.227 --> 17:03.229
<i>you had an informant
in Russian OC, right?</i>

17:03.229 --> 17:05.024
Yeah, Gregor Lebedev.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.818
He started off
as a low-level soldier,

17:06.818 --> 17:09.269
<i>worked his way up the chain
and became an avtoritet.</i>

17:09.269 --> 17:10.822
<i>It's sort of like a captain.</i>

17:10.822 --> 17:12.341
Sounds like someone who'd
have his ear to the ground.

17:12.341 --> 17:14.102
Are you guys putting
Forrester back in play?

17:14.102 --> 17:15.620
Vlad's still out there.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

17:15.620 --> 17:17.312
<i>And every second that passes
buys him more time</i>

17:17.312 --> 17:18.727
<i>to plot a better offensive.</i>

17:18.727 --> 17:20.487
<i>I mean, I hate to say it,
but the Bratva</i>

17:20.487 --> 17:22.558
might be our best shot
at getting a lock on Vlad.

17:22.558 --> 17:24.595
And for that,
we need Forrester

17:24.595 --> 17:26.286
to make contact
with his old source.

17:26.286 --> 17:27.874
You want backup, just say.

17:27.874 --> 17:29.496
<i>Listen, put a wire on me,</i>

17:29.496 --> 17:31.119
<i>but it's best
if Kellett and I handle this.</i>

17:31.119 --> 17:33.638
Gregor has always been
a little bit jumpy.

17:33.638 --> 17:36.400
Hey, can I talk to you two?
In private?

17:45.754 --> 17:47.307
I ran background

17:47.307 --> 17:49.447
on the passenger
Vlad took out on the train.

17:49.447 --> 17:51.829
Our DOA wasn't
just some civilian.

17:51.829 --> 17:54.521
- FSB.
- Low to mid-level.

17:54.521 --> 17:56.282
Vlad's a convict.
It makes sense

17:56.282 --> 17:58.629
that Russia's security service
is hunting him too.

17:58.629 --> 18:00.251
They knew they'd find him
on the train.

18:00.251 --> 18:01.563
It's possible
they've been chasing him

18:01.563 --> 18:03.634
since the jailbreak in Siberia.

18:03.634 --> 18:05.463
But my concern is
whether someone local

18:05.463 --> 18:07.741
has been feeding them intel.

18:07.741 --> 18:10.468
Novikoff.

18:10.468 --> 18:13.299
The FSB didn't mobilize
until after our guest of honor

18:13.299 --> 18:14.921
was already en route
to Budapest.

18:14.921 --> 18:16.198
How's that for timing?

18:16.198 --> 18:17.682
You think
he's playing both sides?

18:17.682 --> 18:19.753
A defector trying
to win his way back

18:19.753 --> 18:21.341
into Russia's good graces?

18:21.341 --> 18:24.517
In the U.S., he was
6,000 miles away from Moscow.

18:24.517 --> 18:26.691
Here, it's a fraction of that.

18:26.691 --> 18:28.797
Something about his arrival
feels off.

18:28.797 --> 18:30.833
We're about to send Forrester
into Russian hands.

18:30.833 --> 18:34.251
And if Novikoff is compromised,
we need to know.

19:01.761 --> 19:06.317
I see your Russian
hasn't gotten any better.

19:06.317 --> 19:09.734
Well, it was decent enough
to avoid me getting shot.

19:19.019 --> 19:22.091
This is a nice place you got.

19:22.091 --> 19:24.715
What, are you really pedaling
back of house these days?

19:24.715 --> 19:26.268
Nothing.
This is all legit.

19:26.268 --> 19:27.511
My own curation.

19:27.511 --> 19:29.409
Permits, taxes, all of it.

19:29.409 --> 19:30.859
You finally went straight.

19:30.859 --> 19:33.206
It's not that easy
to walk away from the family.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.552
I'm finished
with their ways,

19:34.552 --> 19:37.348
but I still have
to look over my shoulder.

19:37.348 --> 19:40.903
And frankly, seeing you here
makes me anxious.

19:42.146 --> 19:45.114
I'm not trying to jam you up.

19:45.114 --> 19:46.702
I got some trouble
coming my way.

19:46.702 --> 19:48.014
How bad?

19:48.014 --> 19:50.706
Vladislav Pavlovic.

19:50.706 --> 19:54.538
I know the Pavlovic brothers
only by name.

19:54.538 --> 19:57.334
As far as assassins go,
they earned their reputation.

19:57.334 --> 19:59.025
He fled Russia
by the skin of his teeth.

19:59.025 --> 20:00.406
This is a one-way ticket
for him.

20:00.406 --> 20:02.062
I just assumed
he needed resources.

20:02.062 --> 20:03.478
Well,
I haven't heard of any--

20:03.478 --> 20:05.894
Um...

20:05.894 --> 20:09.035
If you need my help,
what else can you tell me?

20:09.035 --> 20:11.624
Wait.
You don't need a gun, OK?

20:11.624 --> 20:13.212
Please, you don't need a gun.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.489
No, no, no.
Please, please, please.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.186
This is why
you wanted out of Bratva.

20:22.186 --> 20:24.188
Say hello to Léna.

20:24.188 --> 20:25.500
My wife.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.811
You have a new family.

20:26.811 --> 20:29.158
Scary proposition
in this line of work.

20:29.158 --> 20:32.610
The people we care for
become our biggest liability.

20:32.610 --> 20:34.440
Our enemies can sniff that out.

20:46.728 --> 20:48.108
I still need your help, Gregor.

20:49.386 --> 20:51.077
With the heat on Vlad,

20:51.077 --> 20:53.597
if contact was made,
it would be kept quiet.

20:53.597 --> 20:55.426
As I said,
I haven't heard much.

20:55.426 --> 20:57.152
And would the Bratva
come at me themselves?

20:57.152 --> 20:58.809
Too messy.

20:58.809 --> 21:01.398
Not a good time for
our countrymen to stir the pot.

21:01.398 --> 21:02.744
But they might have
given Vlad wheels,

21:02.744 --> 21:05.850
a safe house, weapons,
under the table.

21:05.850 --> 21:08.025
You're really the one
who put Stepan Pavlovic

21:08.025 --> 21:09.268
six feet under?

21:10.234 --> 21:12.340
That's right.

21:12.340 --> 21:14.238
Károlyi Garden in two hours.

21:14.238 --> 21:16.516
Meet there
after I do some digging.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.327
You do trust him, right?

21:34.327 --> 21:36.053
Gregor has never
crossed me before.

21:36.053 --> 21:37.330
Priorities change.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.711
He's about to have
three mouths to feed.

21:38.711 --> 21:40.678
Yeah, well, we'll know
in a couple of hours.

21:43.681 --> 21:45.062
And when Gregor said
the Bratva doesn't want

21:45.062 --> 21:47.478
to tangle with the feds,
are we sure about that?

21:47.478 --> 21:49.273
Because we have a tail.

21:50.999 --> 21:52.725
Could be Vlad.

21:54.968 --> 21:56.142
It's not him.

21:56.142 --> 21:57.764
Just a crew
doing his dirty work.

21:59.456 --> 22:01.009
- Pull over.
- What?

22:01.009 --> 22:03.563
Their plates aren't local.
This doesn't feel like the mob.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.715
Is there a problem?

22:17.715 --> 22:20.166
Thought maybe
I had a busted tail light.

22:21.132 --> 22:25.274
This man is wanted in Russia
for aiding a fugitive.

22:25.274 --> 22:27.449
We would like
to escort him back.

22:27.449 --> 22:28.519
I haven't seen him.

22:28.519 --> 22:30.832
Have another look.

22:30.832 --> 22:33.041
That was your colleague
taken out on the train.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.319
You two are FSB.

22:35.319 --> 22:36.803
Given the body count
being racked up,

22:36.803 --> 22:38.702
I figured Vlad would be
your first priority here.

22:38.702 --> 22:41.049
If you do see
Sergei Diatchenko,

22:41.049 --> 22:43.223
will you let him know
it's time to come home?

22:43.223 --> 22:45.364
Why? So as soon
as he touches down,

22:45.364 --> 22:47.262
you can execute him?

22:47.262 --> 22:49.816
Look, we both need Vlad gone.

22:49.816 --> 22:51.404
Maybe we can help each other.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.096
Our objectives
concerning Vladislav Pavlovic

22:54.096 --> 22:55.822
do not align.

22:58.549 --> 23:00.724
I know
you're looking for him.

23:09.940 --> 23:12.770
Is it me, or did it sound
like they wanted Vlad alive?

23:12.770 --> 23:14.807
He's wiped out
six Russians in a week,

23:14.807 --> 23:16.325
and they're handling him
with kid gloves.

23:16.325 --> 23:17.534
What the hell is going on?

23:17.534 --> 23:19.570
The CIA is keeping us
in the dark.

23:19.570 --> 23:21.710
My guess, it's got to do
with plans for Vlad.

23:21.710 --> 23:24.126
You think the CIA
wants him alive too?

23:24.126 --> 23:25.852
I'm sure they would love
to haul in Rafferty's killer,

23:25.852 --> 23:28.614
but what does the CIA care
about even more than justice?

23:28.614 --> 23:30.754
- Intel.
- Yeah.

23:30.754 --> 23:32.376
I think you were right.

23:32.376 --> 23:34.136
The reason
Novikoff's here in person,

23:34.136 --> 23:36.518
it's got nothing to do
with my protection.

23:59.852 --> 24:01.716
Gregor?

24:17.663 --> 24:18.940
Someone took out Gregor.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.356
What?
His people get to him?

24:21.356 --> 24:22.633
<i>Knife wound,
close range.</i>

24:22.633 --> 24:23.979
They must have snuck up on him.

24:23.979 --> 24:25.464
It could have been Bratva,
but I don't know.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.051
Scott, what are you doing?

24:27.051 --> 24:29.053
You're a target in that park.
Get the hell out of there.

24:29.053 --> 24:30.158
Hang on.

24:31.987 --> 24:33.057
I got something.

24:47.002 --> 24:48.452
This was Vlad.

24:54.769 --> 24:55.942
CCTV overlooking
the northeast exit

24:55.942 --> 24:57.426
caught someone
leaving the park.

24:57.426 --> 25:01.223
Now, I can't be 100% sure,
but it looks like Vlad.

25:01.223 --> 25:03.191
We lost him in the city
after that.

25:03.191 --> 25:05.227
Gregor sniffing around
would have alerted him,

25:05.227 --> 25:07.091
but clearly,
the message was for us.

25:07.091 --> 25:09.404
We accessed
the thumb drive left behind.

25:09.404 --> 25:13.201
No password or encryption.

25:13.201 --> 25:15.203
Just three photographs
stored on it.

25:15.203 --> 25:17.792
Metadata confirms
these photos were taken

25:17.792 --> 25:20.208
on an FT-30 DSLR
three weeks ago,

25:20.208 --> 25:23.004
here in Budapest.

25:23.004 --> 25:26.594
Vlad wants all of us to know
he's had you in his crosshairs,

25:26.594 --> 25:29.735
even from behind bars
thousands of miles away.

25:29.735 --> 25:32.945
This is his mission,
not the Bratva's.

25:32.945 --> 25:35.844
What about
the numbers 17-11?

25:35.844 --> 25:38.053
We've been crossing things
off the list.

25:38.053 --> 25:40.366
It doesn't signify
a time or date.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.333
Not an address,
not a password.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.404
- Raines has a theory.
- OK.

25:45.751 --> 25:47.407
Leviticus.

25:47.407 --> 25:49.099
From the Old Testament.

25:49.099 --> 25:50.859
It's been a minute
since Sunday school.

25:50.859 --> 25:52.896
The gist is,

25:52.896 --> 25:56.693
blood is the only ordained way
to atone for what you've done.

25:58.280 --> 26:00.628
The price is paid with a life.

26:02.699 --> 26:04.666
It all comes back
to his brother.

26:06.081 --> 26:08.014
If Vlad was locked up
when these were taken,

26:08.014 --> 26:11.397
it means he had help here long
before he approached the mob.

26:11.397 --> 26:13.572
Ansel Adams
might just be a local.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.126
If we find him,
that might lead us to Vlad.

26:16.126 --> 26:17.817
Well, the FT-30 camera
has a feature

26:17.817 --> 26:19.578
where it uploads photos
to the cloud

26:19.578 --> 26:21.476
as soon as there is
a secure Wi-Fi connection.

26:21.476 --> 26:23.961
So if those photos were synced
to the internet,

26:23.961 --> 26:26.101
I mean, the metadata can show
us exactly where it happened,

26:26.101 --> 26:27.724
and we can find
our photographer.

26:27.724 --> 26:29.277
Great.
I need that info yesterday.

26:29.277 --> 26:31.175
- Hey.
- Yeah?

26:31.175 --> 26:32.625
We have a Novikoff problem.

26:34.109 --> 26:36.698
I know.

26:36.698 --> 26:38.700
Come on.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.357
We're short on time,

26:40.357 --> 26:42.083
so let's skip to the part
where you come clean.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.809
Why are you off leash
in Budapest?

26:43.809 --> 26:46.328
Is it for the same reason
the FSB wants Vlad alive?

26:46.328 --> 26:47.571
I don't know.

26:47.571 --> 26:49.228
Your specialty
is counterintelligence.

26:49.228 --> 26:50.816
I bet you've got
a pretty good idea.

26:50.816 --> 26:53.439
I've been in your country's
custody for a year already.

26:53.439 --> 26:54.613
Think I've been
sipping Mai-Tais

26:54.613 --> 26:56.269
and putting my toes
in the sand?

26:56.269 --> 26:57.754
They've been
putting me to work.

26:57.754 --> 26:59.859
And the more secrets
I deliver to the U.S.,

26:59.859 --> 27:02.897
the less valuable I become.
- Oh, so that's it.

27:02.897 --> 27:04.484
If the FSB captures Vlad first,

27:04.484 --> 27:06.901
he becomes a chip
to bring you home.

27:06.901 --> 27:08.350
This has really been a trade.

27:08.350 --> 27:09.904
If they don't
need me anymore,

27:09.904 --> 27:13.424
I'm sure the U.S. would love
to pick his brain next.

27:13.424 --> 27:14.598
I'm guessing
you'd prefer

27:14.598 --> 27:16.565
we find Vlad
before the Russians do.

27:16.565 --> 27:18.775
Obviously,
a trade with the FSB

27:18.775 --> 27:22.226
would be very bad
for a man in my shoes.

27:22.226 --> 27:25.195
They don't forgive traitors.

27:25.195 --> 27:28.232
We can't be your safety net
this time.

27:37.345 --> 27:38.898
Hey, we got something.

27:38.898 --> 27:41.211
It was buried in code,
but we snagged an IP address.

27:41.211 --> 27:42.384
Vo cross-checked it

27:42.384 --> 27:43.731
with the telecom companies
in town.

27:43.731 --> 27:46.561
And a name hit.
- Aron Németh, 36 years old.

27:46.561 --> 27:48.805
A private investigator
born and raised in Budapest.

27:48.805 --> 27:50.738
We've got an address.
It's in District Six.

27:50.738 --> 27:52.394
Raines, you're with me
on this one. Come on.

28:04.717 --> 28:08.100
I don't always know who
hires me for these things, OK?

28:08.100 --> 28:09.895
We agree, they pay.

28:09.895 --> 28:11.448
I don't ask any questions.

28:11.448 --> 28:13.139
The prison guard said
he was sending packages

28:13.139 --> 28:14.934
on behalf of Vlad.

28:14.934 --> 28:17.385
Sergei Diatchenko.
That your contact?

28:17.385 --> 28:19.525
My business relies
on discretion.

28:19.525 --> 28:21.838
I was given your name,
and I did the rest.

28:21.838 --> 28:24.392
When the job was done,
I mailed the photos on a USB.

28:24.392 --> 28:25.600
And it didn't
strike you as odd,

28:25.600 --> 28:26.912
being asked
to tail an FBI agent

28:26.912 --> 28:28.914
and send your findings
back to Russia?

28:28.914 --> 28:30.674
I didn't think
I was doing anything wrong.

28:30.674 --> 28:31.813
Forrester.

28:36.162 --> 28:38.026
It's all of us.

28:38.026 --> 28:39.372
Every Fly Team member.

28:39.372 --> 28:41.098
They paid
for full surveillance--

28:41.098 --> 28:43.480
him and his closest contacts.

28:46.759 --> 28:47.933
Raines.

28:55.561 --> 28:57.494
You sent all these
to your client?

28:57.494 --> 29:00.152
Hey, answer me!
Has Vlad seen these?

29:00.152 --> 29:01.394
Yes.

29:01.394 --> 29:04.018
That was the job.

29:11.611 --> 29:14.304
Come on.
Come on.

29:14.304 --> 29:15.788
<i>Hi, it's Maya.</i>

29:15.788 --> 29:17.997
<i>Leave a message
after the beep.</i>

29:29.181 --> 29:30.389
That's Maya's bike.

29:37.154 --> 29:39.087
Maya!

29:39.087 --> 29:40.813
Babe!

29:40.813 --> 29:42.332
Maya!

29:42.332 --> 29:43.920
Anything?

29:50.858 --> 29:52.652
Is that--

29:54.827 --> 29:56.035
Blood.

30:06.390 --> 30:07.633
<i>Sorry.
We're closed.</i>

30:09.048 --> 30:10.739
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

30:10.739 --> 30:13.190
<i>Stop! Hey!
What the--</i>

30:13.190 --> 30:16.538
<i>Help!</i>

30:21.095 --> 30:23.580
<i>Help!</i>

30:34.971 --> 30:36.213
I should have been here.

30:36.213 --> 30:38.526
Hey,
we're gonna get her back.

30:41.149 --> 30:42.633
What?
- I hooked up

30:42.633 --> 30:44.187
the entire wireless system
inside the bar.

30:44.187 --> 30:46.051
I know all the components.

30:47.328 --> 30:49.675
This isn't one of ours.

30:49.675 --> 30:51.297
We're being watched.

31:13.975 --> 31:15.321
Is she alive?

31:15.321 --> 31:18.083
<i>Red Star train yard.
Come alone.</i>

31:18.083 --> 31:21.603
<i>If I see agents,
I promise you blood.</i>

31:21.603 --> 31:23.157
<i>She will die first.</i>

31:26.263 --> 31:28.507
What did he say?

31:28.507 --> 31:29.853
He wants to meet.

31:29.853 --> 31:31.165
- Then what are we waiting for?
- Just me.

31:31.165 --> 31:33.892
- Like hell.
- Maya's alive.

31:33.892 --> 31:38.241
Vlad said if anyone else comes,
he'll kill her.

31:40.105 --> 31:43.073
I know that this is impossible,

31:43.073 --> 31:44.281
but you've got
to trust me, Raines.

31:44.281 --> 31:45.489
What do you
expect me to do, man?

31:45.489 --> 31:46.732
I'll handle it.

31:46.732 --> 31:47.871
You're not pushing me
to the side,

31:47.871 --> 31:49.355
not when that son of a bitch
has Maya!

31:49.355 --> 31:51.150
The people that we love
become our biggest liability.

31:51.150 --> 31:52.393
I've been where you are.

31:52.393 --> 31:53.773
You want me to step aside?

31:53.773 --> 31:55.499
You're gonna have to make me.

31:55.499 --> 31:57.087
Move!

31:57.087 --> 31:58.744
Fine.

31:58.744 --> 32:01.920
But he knows we're together,
so we have to be smart.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.231
We split up.

32:03.231 --> 32:05.820
One target, two sides.

32:05.820 --> 32:08.029
Pincer move. Got it.

32:09.582 --> 32:10.652
Let's go.

32:20.248 --> 32:21.629
I know your instinct

32:21.629 --> 32:24.045
is to protect people
in the line of fire.

32:24.045 --> 32:27.290
Just so you know,
it's the same for me.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.990
Hey, I'm gonna need a favor.

32:55.180 --> 32:58.286
No. No way.

32:58.286 --> 32:59.874
He played me?
- No.

32:59.874 --> 33:01.082
This is
about getting Maya back.

33:01.082 --> 33:02.463
Where's Vlad at?

33:02.463 --> 33:05.190
Look, just tell me
where Forrester is going.

33:05.190 --> 33:07.399
You can fix this right now.

33:07.399 --> 33:09.918
He didn't say,
but this was a direct order.

33:09.918 --> 33:12.645
Cameron, Jamie, please!

33:12.645 --> 33:14.682
Look, I need to know
where Maya was taken.

33:14.682 --> 33:15.994
Come on!

33:16.684 --> 33:19.307
I know it feels like you're
getting shut out right now,

33:19.307 --> 33:20.722
but Forrester,
he knows what to do.

33:20.722 --> 33:22.034
He'll bring her back.

33:22.034 --> 33:23.415
He won't let Vlad
get away with this.

33:23.415 --> 33:25.831
We have seen what
that bastard is capable of!

33:25.831 --> 33:28.454
Come on!

33:28.454 --> 33:31.112
If anything happens to her,
to either of them,

33:31.112 --> 33:32.838
that's on all of us.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.791
I'm here.
Now let her go.

34:29.791 --> 34:31.103
You think you're in control?

34:31.103 --> 34:33.209
She's got nothing
to do with this.

34:33.209 --> 34:35.349
"The life of the flesh
is in the blood,

34:35.349 --> 34:38.352
"and I have given it to make
atonement for your souls,

34:38.352 --> 34:41.113
for it is the blood that
makes atonement by the life."

34:41.113 --> 34:43.253
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

34:43.253 --> 34:45.186
You want me to pay
for what I took.

34:45.186 --> 34:49.501
A debt of spilled blood
can only be paid one way.

34:49.501 --> 34:50.743
Weapon.

34:57.854 --> 35:00.995
I'm here now,
so let's end this.

35:25.157 --> 35:28.609
I failed my brother,
and I've answered for that.

35:28.609 --> 35:30.024
Now it's your turn.

35:56.568 --> 35:59.260
Maya, hey. Hey.

35:59.260 --> 36:00.951
Oh, thank God.

36:00.951 --> 36:02.712
It's OK.
I got you.

36:02.712 --> 36:04.196
It's OK.

36:06.267 --> 36:07.786
You're OK.

36:24.112 --> 36:26.563
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

36:26.563 --> 36:28.358
- You sure?
- Yeah.

36:33.087 --> 36:35.123
We'd like to examine you
at the hospital.

36:38.265 --> 36:39.576
I'm not leaving your side.

36:39.576 --> 36:43.787
Hey, I promise
I'll be right behind you, OK?

36:43.787 --> 36:45.306
All right.
Come on.

36:48.033 --> 36:50.553
Just give me a sec.

37:00.079 --> 37:02.047
Is she OK?

37:02.047 --> 37:04.083
I think you know.

37:06.672 --> 37:08.295
Are we OK?

37:31.007 --> 37:33.009
When Vlad got that bullet,

37:33.009 --> 37:35.770
any deal between the FSB
and the U.S. government

37:35.770 --> 37:37.462
evaporated then and there.

37:37.462 --> 37:40.430
With the hitman gone
and nothing to swap...

37:40.430 --> 37:42.743
Finally,
you'll get those Mai-Tais.

37:44.814 --> 37:48.680
Once again,

37:48.680 --> 37:50.198
I owe you my life.

37:50.198 --> 37:52.200
I'm glad
it worked out for you.

37:53.547 --> 37:54.720
Oh, look.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.584
My ride is here.

38:09.839 --> 38:11.875
So now I'm curious.

38:11.875 --> 38:13.118
If you did secure Vlad,

38:13.118 --> 38:14.568
what would have happened
to Novikoff?

38:14.568 --> 38:16.535
Come on, we were never
gonna give up the old man.

38:16.535 --> 38:17.812
That would undermine
the government's

38:17.812 --> 38:20.228
entire asylum program.

38:20.228 --> 38:21.575
Uh-huh.

38:38.281 --> 38:40.007
I'm right here,
if you need me.

38:43.010 --> 38:44.598
I can't.

38:44.598 --> 38:46.116
I don't want
to go back in there.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.498
Hey, it's OK.

38:48.498 --> 38:49.568
Baby, you don't have to.

38:53.779 --> 38:54.987
Come here.

38:59.992 --> 39:02.132
I'm sorry for not being there.

39:05.481 --> 39:08.553
I need to tell you something. Um...

39:08.553 --> 39:11.141
At the train yard,

39:11.141 --> 39:13.489
when I was alone with that man,

39:13.489 --> 39:16.837
he said something.

39:16.837 --> 39:18.494
He told me
the minute he saw you,

39:18.494 --> 39:20.944
he was gonna
put a bullet in me.

39:20.944 --> 39:24.465
He wanted you to witness.

39:24.465 --> 39:26.640
I was so sure
you were gonna see it happen.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.230
But it was like you knew.

39:32.818 --> 39:35.373
And that might be the reason
I'm alive right now,

39:35.373 --> 39:38.617
because
he didn't see you there.

39:40.654 --> 39:42.932
I'm so glad you're OK.
