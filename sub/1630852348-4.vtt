00:17.517 --> 00:20.478
NARRATOR: <i>Our story begins in the library</i>
<i>of an enchanted castle.</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:23.398
<i>Where everyday household objects</i>
<i>have come alive.</i>

00:23.940 --> 00:26.109
<i>Oh. What are you doing in here,</i> mon chéri?

00:26.192 --> 00:28.820
<i>Why aren't you at dinner</i>
<i>with your best friend Belle and the Beast?</i>

00:28.945 --> 00:31.948
Well, I just wanted to give Belle
and the Beast some alone time.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.117
Besides, it's starting
to feel a little bit like

00:34.200 --> 00:36.411
Beauty and the Beast and the third wheel.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.787
NARRATOR: <i>But Belle is your best friend.</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:39.831
<i>I'm sure she wouldn't mind</i>
<i>you tagging along.</i>

00:39.998 --> 00:43.418
I know, it's just after seeing Belle
and all her wonderful friends

00:43.501 --> 00:46.463
in the castle, I sort of want an adventure
of my own.

00:46.671 --> 00:49.758
NARRATOR:<i> Oh, I see you have the spirit</i>
<i>of a true </i>originale.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.468
<i>Perhaps,</i>
<i>there's something I can do for you.</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:54.137
Do you mean it?
I wouldn't wanna put you out.

00:54.262 --> 00:58.433
NARRATOR: <i>Please. Here you are a guest,</i>
<i>and we love to make our guests happy.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:00.268
(SIGHS) This is amazing.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.520
NARRATOR: <i>I think you'll find</i>
<i>there's something amazing and magical</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:03.813
<i>around every corner here.</i>

01:03.938 --> 01:05.398
-Will you show me?
-NARRATOR: Oui.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.233
<i>-I'd be happy to, </i>mon chéri.
-(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:08.401 --> 01:10.153
NARRATOR:
<i>But I think I may need to ask for help.</i>

01:11.321 --> 01:13.740
<i>Allow me to introduce you</i>
<i>to three exceptional teams,</i>

01:14.199 --> 01:15.867
<i>of the world's best food artists.</i>

01:16.701 --> 01:20.330
<i>Introducing veteran competitors,</i>
<i>the Food Fanatics.</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:25.502
<i>Expert carvers and chocolatiers,</i>
<i>the Creative Villains.</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:31.633
<i>And the Weirdoughs,</i>
<i>three rising pastry superstars.</i>

01:32.008 --> 01:35.261
<i>Which of these three teams</i>
<i>can entertain Belle's best friend</i>

01:35.970 --> 01:39.057
<i>and win the coveted Disney</i> Foodtastic<i> pin.</i>

01:39.224 --> 01:41.976
<i>An item as rare as Gaston on a cheat day.</i>

01:42.477 --> 01:47.565
(MAGICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

01:51.736 --> 01:54.531
RYSE: Wow, she's so pretty.

01:55.156 --> 01:59.828
(CALM MUSIC PLAYING)

02:04.833 --> 02:09.587
A girl... born to a provincial life
in a small town

02:09.754 --> 02:12.549
who uses books to escape her reality,

02:12.674 --> 02:14.759
who yearns for something more.

02:14.884 --> 02:18.054
Like Belle, people all over
the world dream of bigger

02:18.138 --> 02:19.222
and better things.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.517
This is <i>Foodtastic.</i>

02:25.019 --> 02:27.814
Today, we're in a place
with a cursed prince,

02:27.981 --> 02:30.275
and an enchanted rose.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.654
Welcome to the world
of<i> Beauty and the Beast,</i> food artists.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.406
ALL: (CHEER)

02:36.948 --> 02:38.741
I'm glad I'm not in this alone.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.870
Thankfully, joining us is a duo
who can guide us

02:42.036 --> 02:45.623
through the dark and mysterious woods
of the food art world.

02:45.707 --> 02:50.170
Our food art experts,
Amirah Kassem and Benny Rivera.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.421
ALL: (CHEER)

02:51.546 --> 02:53.798
<i>Bonjour,</i> Benny and Amirah.

02:54.716 --> 02:59.637
Food artists, your task today
is to take these legendary characters

02:59.846 --> 03:02.599
and put them into new scenarios,
where they're trying

03:02.807 --> 03:06.227
to hilariously cheer up
Belle's best friend.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.605
-Okay. We could do that. We could do that.
-My God, yeah. We could.

03:08.730 --> 03:13.526
That means, perfect details,
beautiful colors and stunning texture.

03:13.985 --> 03:18.740
Your characters need to be recognizable
from <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

03:19.032 --> 03:20.992
We want you to make us believe

03:21.075 --> 03:24.954
that these characters
are inanimate objects coming to life.

03:25.163 --> 03:29.042
Storytelling is so, so important
to what Disney does with their magic.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.670
The characters you choose need
to be used in fresh ways.

03:32.795 --> 03:37.592
Show me how creative you are by putting
your own little spin on this fairytale.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.428
KEKE: And please know,
any food you do not use

03:40.553 --> 03:43.056
in your build will be donated to charity.

03:43.306 --> 03:48.478
Now, while this tale may be as old
as time, you don't have that long.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.273
And like the Beast,
we will be telling time

03:52.398 --> 03:53.983
via an enchanted rose.

03:55.985 --> 03:59.906
As time goes on, petals will fall.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.699
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)

04:03.660 --> 04:05.203
-Oh.
-KEKE: And when that final petal

04:05.286 --> 04:07.497
hits the ground, your time is up.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.963
Now, go play with your food!

04:15.338 --> 04:17.090
-YAYA: Okay.
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

04:17.340 --> 04:19.968
-NANCY: Clock is ticking.
-All right. So...

04:20.677 --> 04:22.387
To help cheer up Belle's best friend,

04:22.762 --> 04:25.598
we're gonna do a giant
fruit-carved archway.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.810
<i>For our foodscape, we're building</i>
<i>an enchanted winter wonderland</i>

04:28.935 --> 04:31.062
<i>that's gonna have Sultan,</i>
<i>the little ottoman dog,</i>

04:31.229 --> 04:32.272
<i>and the Coat Rack.</i>

04:32.355 --> 04:33.898
DOMINIC:
<i>Coat Rack is gonna be four foot tall.</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:35.441
All different techniques of chocolate.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.861
To cheer up Belle's best friend,
Sultan and Coat Rack decided

04:39.028 --> 04:42.198
to have a snowball fight
in the enchanted winter garden

04:42.323 --> 04:43.700
just outside the castle grounds.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.286
Can you guide me a little bit on...
on the techniques...

04:46.411 --> 04:48.871
-Yeah, sure.
-BRANDON: What's unique about this garden

04:48.955 --> 04:50.707
is it only blooms in the winter

04:50.790 --> 04:52.333
-because it is enchanted.
-Oh yeah.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.502
I do fruit and vegetable carving
and sculpting.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.629
So, we're gonna have a giant arch

04:56.754 --> 04:59.799
of all beautifully carved fruits,
vegetables.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.052
How are you guys planning to build such
an elaborate structure?

05:03.136 --> 05:07.223
That's gonna be a tricky part.
We're gonna try to get an arch support

05:07.473 --> 05:09.642
and actually kinda
shish-kebab them on there.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.311
-BENNY: Okay.
-Just be careful because as that weight

05:11.394 --> 05:14.397
comes from the top, those start to go
into the rod

05:14.480 --> 05:17.066
-from the weight of the top.
-Yup. It's definitely a worry. Yup.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.862
RYSE: We are making Chef Bouche.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.489
-Yeah.
-Chef Bouche is a giant...

05:23.656 --> 05:24.782
-Beast of an oven.
-Right.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.659
LINDSEY: You know
what'd really drive Bouche nuts is

05:26.743 --> 05:28.536
if we put a bunch of kids in the kitchen

05:28.619 --> 05:29.954
-and mess up his kitchen.
-RYSE: Oh.

05:30.079 --> 05:32.665
So, Chip, maybe all of his siblings too.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.208
-Siblings. Yup.
-Siblings to create more chaos.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.585
-LINDSEY: All right.
-RYSE: I'm going to make Chip

05:35.668 --> 05:36.586
out of jicama,

05:36.669 --> 05:39.213
because jicama does not oxidize
and it's white.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.049
We gotta make the grey stuff.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.884
-LINDSEY: Oh yeah, the grey stuff.
-RYSE: It is delicious.

05:42.967 --> 05:44.010
-AMIRAH: Weirdoughs!
-BENNY: Hi!

05:44.093 --> 05:45.094
Hi, guys.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.513
And I don't mean weirdo,
I mean Weirdoughs.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.015
-BENNY: Yes. Yes.
-We're both.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.351
And what do you guys do usually?
What's your skill set?

05:51.517 --> 05:52.810
We are all pastry chefs actually.

05:52.894 --> 05:53.853
-We all are.
-Wow.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.564
I like to work in a lot
of different mediums.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.483
RYSE:<i> I like to work with cheese,</i>

05:58.608 --> 06:01.069
<i>pumpkins. Biodegradable art...</i>

06:01.194 --> 06:02.820
-AMIRAH: (CHUCKLING)
<i>-...that's what I like to call it.</i>

06:02.904 --> 06:04.364
-Do you work together?
-We work together.

06:04.447 --> 06:08.743
I met Lindsey
when we were in culinary school.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.953
And then Erin, I met...

06:11.120 --> 06:12.663
-At a bar.
-...at a bar.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.915
ALL: (LAUGH)

06:14.040 --> 06:16.709
So, what's the plan?
I mean, I see a lot of details here.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.378
Do you know the scene
where they open the cupboard...

06:18.461 --> 06:20.171
Yes, and they start jumping around.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.881
...when they go to bed and all of the kids
are in there.

06:21.964 --> 06:25.051
So we thought that will be really fun
to play off of that

06:25.134 --> 06:29.055
<i>and Chef Bouche is trying to make</i>
<i>all these wonderful treats</i>

06:29.138 --> 06:33.142
<i>to try to cheer up Belle's best friend.</i>
<i>Then, the kids come in and try to help.</i>

06:33.267 --> 06:35.853
<i>I will be carving all of Chip</i>
<i>and the siblings.</i>

06:35.978 --> 06:39.899
-So Chef Bouche, who's grandiose.
-LINDSEY: He's about ten feet tall.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.859
-Did you say ten feet?
-LINDSEY: Yeah.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.862
-Wow.
-So we thought scale would be important

06:44.946 --> 06:48.658
to this challenge. So, if we need to make
a tiny teacup then the stove can't be...

06:48.741 --> 06:50.618
Nobody wants to see Chip be this big so...

06:50.743 --> 06:52.161
-That's a good point. I like to hear that.
-RYSE: Yeah.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.497
MARK: Brunch for Belle's best friend.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.832
-Brunch for Belle's best friend. Got it.
-Yes.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.458
NANCY: So, Cogsworth.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.461
<i>He's gonna be standing</i>
<i>on some recipe books...</i>

07:00.545 --> 07:01.546
-JEAN:<i> Okay.</i>
<i>-...that are carved</i>

07:01.671 --> 07:02.713
<i>-...out of cheese. Perfect.</i>
-MARK: <i>Cheese.</i>

07:02.797 --> 07:05.633
-Wardrobe? Wardrobe...
-JEAN: <i>Well, that would be a nice big</i>

07:05.758 --> 07:07.718
<i>-centerpiece right there.</i>
-NANCY:<i> Cogsworth,</i>

07:07.844 --> 07:10.138
<i>the Wardrobe and Feather Duster</i>

07:10.263 --> 07:15.101
<i>are putting together the most</i>
<i>delightful, amazing, food-art breakfast.</i>

07:15.226 --> 07:17.937
This is Disney. We have to nail
these expressions in these characters.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.355
-Yes, absolutely.
-All about the expressions.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.316
-JEAN: I think, this looks amazing.
-I'm excited to work with you guys.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.111
I mean, you guys are all very talented
and I think we can pull this off.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.404
-Yeah.
-It's a dream come true.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.864
-Yeah, I mean.
-We got energy.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.574
-Yes.
-We got age.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.909
-Yeah. (LAUGHS)
-We have the experience.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.454
I've done numerous competitions,
12 years now.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.955
I have the bug. I love doing it.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.331
High five, guys. Let's go.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.375
ALL: (GRUNT)

07:39.500 --> 07:43.546
This is just like something so super cool
that we've never be able to do before.

07:43.671 --> 07:48.050
What do the young people say?
We... We be vibin'. (LAUGHS)

07:48.217 --> 07:49.886
-I don't know if I've heard that one.
-Yeah.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.514
-I don't know if I heard that one before.
-Maybe a generation back a few.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.849
DOMINIC: Come on, guys.

07:55.391 --> 07:58.644
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

07:58.978 --> 08:02.273
-DOMINIC: (LAUGHING) So much stuff to use.
-LINDSEY: (LAUGHING) Oh my goodness.

08:02.565 --> 08:06.986
BRANDON:<i> Squash, zucchini, radishes,</i>
<i>celery. I can carve it.</i>

08:07.069 --> 08:09.071
-Whoa! (CHUCKLING)
-NANCY: What!

08:09.155 --> 08:11.115
-MARE: Holy cow!
-RYSE: Amazing.

08:11.824 --> 08:12.992
-LINDSEY: Oh, my God.
-ERIN: So good!

08:13.284 --> 08:14.869
<i>That pantry is incredible.</i>

08:17.038 --> 08:20.791
RYSE: This is a great big jicama. Yes.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.252
BRANDON:
Look at all these vegetables. Holy cow.

08:23.336 --> 08:27.215
-And pasta. Okay, those would be his arms.
-All right, let's get it.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.509
BRANDON: <i>It is time.</i>

08:30.885 --> 08:34.472
I'm just gonna start shaping up some
of this flat bread for Wardrobe.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.767
Nancy, I'm gonna make the modelling
chocolate for Wardrobe's face.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.018
NANCY: Oh, perfect.

08:39.101 --> 08:43.481
So, I'm starting to stack the cake at...
which is gonna be the very, very top

08:43.564 --> 08:47.151
of Bouche's hat right now,
that's what I have in front of me.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.028
For me, winning this competition
would be huge

08:49.153 --> 08:51.906
<i>because I just want validation</i>
<i>and the recognition</i>

08:51.989 --> 08:55.451
in this industry of being a food artist.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.662
ERIN:<i> Buttercream as glue.</i>

08:57.828 --> 08:59.997
If we could take home that Disney pin...

09:00.081 --> 09:01.624
-RYSE: "When?"
-(LAUGHING)

09:02.041 --> 09:06.003
...for myself, it would really be a help
to my confidence.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.798
This thing's... really heavy.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.592
BRANDON: How're you doing, Dom?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.844
DOMINIC: Pretty good,
just melting chocolate.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.221
Yaya, what's your game plan?

09:15.304 --> 09:19.058
So after I've carved out his edges,
I'm gonna cover Sultan

09:19.183 --> 09:21.143
in red fondant and just bring him to life,

09:21.269 --> 09:23.646
make it look like he jumped right out
of <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

09:23.729 --> 09:28.734
Each one of our strengths is detail work.
We're gonna work separately on our pieces

09:28.818 --> 09:30.903
<i>because they require so much attention</i>
<i>to detail</i>

09:30.987 --> 09:33.948
and when we all put them together,
it's just gonna have that wow factor.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.783
DOMINIC: How are you doing with
your carvings over there? What you got?

09:35.866 --> 09:38.202
I am working
on just some different varieties

09:38.286 --> 09:41.831
of flowers that are gonna fill our garden
and the arch.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.876
So, it's... it's pretty much just, uh,
line work on this melon.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.962
You make a cut, you trace it,

09:48.170 --> 09:50.548
and then you make another cut
to reveal that cut.

09:50.631 --> 09:53.175
Pretty much
all ancient Thai carving techniques

09:53.342 --> 09:55.845
are gonna be
your really detailed carvings.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.264
But yeah, this is just a honeydew.

09:58.347 --> 10:01.684
-You can do like one melon in 20 minutes.
-I can.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.311
-YAYA: Those look so good.
-DOMINIC: Looks amazing!

10:03.436 --> 10:04.562
YAYA: Those are amazing.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.939
DOMINIC: <i>You know, chocolate melts</i>
<i>at different phases.</i>

10:07.064 --> 10:08.774
<i>So, that's why you bring it up to 118,</i>

10:08.899 --> 10:11.193
<i>and then you wanna bring it down</i>
<i>as fast as possible.</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:12.903
<i>And that's what gives chocolate</i>
<i>its strength.</i>

10:13.029 --> 10:15.656
<i>If the base doesn't happen,</i>
<i>nothing happens.</i>

10:15.781 --> 10:17.074
<i>You really can't go back,</i>

10:17.158 --> 10:20.620
and then Coat Rack's gonna
be not a Coat Rack, you know. (LAUGHS)

10:20.703 --> 10:22.663
-AMIRAH: Hello, Dom.
-Hello, how's it going?

10:22.913 --> 10:25.374
-You're tempering chocolate over here?
-Yup, I'm...

10:25.499 --> 10:26.667
-Ooh.
-I've been doing different batches.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.170
DOMINIC: We want it to be nice, shiny,
you can see it from the top.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.172
It's <i>Beauty and the Beast,</i>
and it's so beautiful.

10:31.297 --> 10:34.508
And you need that silky smooth,
where your chocolate's tempered.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.053
And, uh, this is gonna be the base
for Coat Rack.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.555
The body, I'm gonna do some hooks
to give it flair.

10:39.680 --> 10:42.266
The head, and then on top,
we're gonna do that nice top hat. (LAUGHS)

10:42.433 --> 10:44.602
-Okay.
-All right, we're excited to see that.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.812
AMIRAH: Let's check out
what's going on over here.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.606
-BENNY: Yeah.
-AMIRAH: (GASPS) Look at this.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.733
-Lots of roses, lots of flowers...
-BENNY: That's beautiful. Beautiful.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.818
-...lots of carvings.
-Oh my goodness.

10:52.902 --> 10:56.822
Now, if you notice, he have this piece
wrapped in paper towel, completely wet.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.491
-AMIRAH: Totally, you don't want it...
-BENNY: That's the technique.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.201
AMIRAH: ...drying out.
I mean, you might be the fastest carver

11:00.284 --> 11:01.535
-I've ever seen.
-I try.

11:01.619 --> 11:02.912
AMIRAH: What are you doing over here?

11:03.037 --> 11:04.955
It seems like you're defying gravity
with this cake.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.458
Do you think that the weight isn't going
to bounce off...

11:07.625 --> 11:09.502
-Nope.
-...as you start working on it.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.253
-Pretty sturdy.
-That's sturdy.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.256
Once your structure is down,
it's never gonna fall.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.092
-(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
-(MACHINE WHIRRING)

11:16.217 --> 11:20.638
-AMIRAH: Mark, what are you working on?
-I am creating marbleized floor tiles.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.557
I am sculpting the head for Cogsworth.

11:23.641 --> 11:27.186
I'm very confident
I can pull off his very recognizable face.

11:27.436 --> 11:31.273
I wanna get at least one
of these recipe books knocked out.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.943
They're crucial for Cogsworth to set on.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.571
The cheese isn't as big
as I usually work with. That's okay,

11:37.655 --> 11:41.075
because I can use some dowels, splice it
together, then start forming the book.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.576
Don't worry about the seams.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.413
Not a lot of that's gonna show up
when we paint it with gel.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.373
We're just using like a mild cheddar.

11:47.748 --> 11:51.293
Cheese is just like sculpting
any subtractive medium,

11:51.544 --> 11:54.797
unlike if I was sculpting marble
or even pumpkin,

11:54.880 --> 11:57.758
once it's gone, it's gone.
But with cheese, it's almost like clay.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.095
There's a lot of tricks that you can use
to hide seams and such.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.556
<i>You know, when people</i>
<i>come across my sculptures,</i>

12:03.889 --> 12:08.018
<i>a lot of times, they don't realize</i>
<i>that it's cheese.</i>

12:08.102 --> 12:09.979
<i>When they finally realize it's cheese,</i>
<i>they're like,</i>

12:10.062 --> 12:12.815
<i>"Well, you put that in a mold, right?"</i>
<i>They just don't know what to think.</i>

12:13.315 --> 12:15.484
Hey, Mark, I'm almost done
with this first book.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.861
-MARK: Cool.
-NANCY: And then I think I need

12:16.944 --> 12:18.779
to get started on that Wardrobe.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.823
-MARK: Okay.
-NANCY: So, would you tag team?

12:20.948 --> 12:23.659
-MARK: Yeah.
-I think our team dynamic is great.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.829
We all trust each other's skills,
and this is where it's great

12:27.037 --> 12:31.125
that we're intercrossing and crossing
the beams, um, to get this done.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.419
This is the perfect pliability.

12:57.359 --> 13:00.613
-It's awesome. That is insane. It's good.
-NANCY: That's insane. That is so spot on.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.739
-Okay.
-MARK: Perfect.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.157
All right. I think I'm done
with this book.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.868
-NANCY: Wow.
-Oh, it looks good!

13:05.951 --> 13:08.788
I think winning this competition,
you know, might validate,

13:08.871 --> 13:12.541
yeah, that we're better than the others,
which I think we all believe we are.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.294
With a name like Food Fanatics,
it sounds like

13:15.461 --> 13:17.880
you were made for <i>Foodtastic.</i>
How you doing, Mark?

13:17.963 --> 13:19.215
-JEAN: (CHUCKLING) Right!
-MARK: Good. How you doing?

13:19.298 --> 13:21.217
I'm so good. What are you doing over here?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.677
-MARK: I am marbleizing fondant.
-Ooh!

13:23.844 --> 13:25.971

of our display.

for this piece right here?

13:28.057 --> 13:29.225
The sculpting that's been done on here.

I mean, you guys are ahead,

13:36.899 --> 13:38.400
you say you've been doing it for a while.

-I mean, what's the secret tool?
-Well, we're older, that's why.

-Bouche is a beast.

is really important.

-and that's what goes up on top.

the weight of that piece?

-Oh. Look at those guns.

RYSE: Definitely not.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.700
I hope you still have enough time
for all the details.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.120
Yes, me too. We're working hard
to get 'em all in there.

14:31.287 --> 14:34.248
What make you guys leave
the rice cereal panels

14:34.415 --> 14:35.624
on the actual board?

14:35.749 --> 14:38.544
We're gonna cover all of this
with buttercream,

14:38.794 --> 14:41.297
and then we're just using the buttercream
as an adhesive,

14:41.380 --> 14:42.965
and we're gonna be putting nori

14:43.382 --> 14:44.884
-on the outside of all of it.
-BENNY: Okay.

14:45.009 --> 14:50.014
Now, I see a lot of cake here.
You have to be careful with this choice.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.682
Buttercream is really soft.

14:51.807 --> 14:55.060
If you're gonna place such a tall layer
of buttercream,

14:55.144 --> 14:57.521
there's the risk of gravity to,
kind of, like...

14:57.938 --> 15:00.274

-No risk, no reward, Benny.

-All right.

-There's more than enough to fill this.
-DOMINIC: Yeah.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.493
That's what we wanted. There we go.

-DOMINIC: Yeah.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.664

15:19.627 --> 15:23.005

Then you just go back and smooth it

15:23.172 --> 15:24.465
-after you shave it.
-DOMINIC: Yeah.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.966
-Nice.
-DOMINIC: This is gonna be the base

15:26.050 --> 15:28.010
for the hat. What's great about
smoothing it out,

15:28.135 --> 15:29.762
is that we're gonna get those edges off,

15:29.845 --> 15:31.597
and then it's gonna
have a more natural feel.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.433
Kinda like the brim of a hat,
kinda has that rounded edges.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.603

of their work seems really good.

-It's going, Nancy.
-BENNY: I have to say that,

15:53.410 --> 15:55.704
so far, they are the only team

15:55.788 --> 15:58.749

the Disney characters coming to life.

-just even layering to hold it together.
-RYSE: (SIGHS) Okay.

to the basics.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.757
Okay, back to work. Those rose petals

18:53.841 --> 18:56.260
won't stay on forever, people.
Get to the pantry. Now!

18:56.552 --> 18:57.928
MARK: Come on, let's go. Go.

18:58.428 --> 19:03.559
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

19:07.229 --> 19:08.772
YAYA: Oh, look at this.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.692
-We have some lychees, strawberries.
-Strawberries.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.277
-Smell it. Smells good right there.
-Yeah.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.571
-YAYA: Nothing...
-And a beet. I like the beet.

19:16.029 --> 19:19.616
-ERIN: This thing is like so weird.
-RYSE: Oh, it's stinky.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.160
(LAUGHS)

19:21.243 --> 19:26.206
-Well, I've never seen that before either.
-ERIN: This thing is very weird looking.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.583
RYSE: It's a really good

19:27.708 --> 19:29.835
-mixture of colors.
-LINDSEY: Yeah.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.754
These will be really good additions
for our treats.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.922
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Yeah.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.218
-So, this jackfruit is, uh, hideous.
-YAYA: I think...

19:38.302 --> 19:39.595
BRANDON:
This will be kinda hard to work in.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.762
...this heirloom tomato
takes the cake. Ugh.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.556
-BRANDON: Yeah, that's not good either.
-DOMINIC: Look at that.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.475
-What do you do with that?
I'm gonna do something with it.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.228
-BRANDON: It will make a great leaf.
-Okay.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.813
BRANDON:
Definitely gonna carve this into a rose.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.523
This can definitely be carved.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.193
<i>This is gonna add, just,</i>
<i>way more dimension to the entire garden.</i>

19:54.484 --> 19:57.654
You know, I just see funny little faces.
We need to transform 'em more.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.282
<i>How about we make Wardrobe a pantry?</i>

20:00.365 --> 20:02.701
MARK: <i>Maybe, she transforms</i>
<i>because she's enchanted.</i>

20:02.910 --> 20:04.203
NANCY:<i> Excellent. I love it.</i>

20:04.328 --> 20:07.039
<i>Then the story of Wardrobe</i>
<i>has been transformed</i>

20:07.164 --> 20:10.209
<i>and the vegetables in the pantry</i>
<i>have come to life.</i>

20:10.292 --> 20:13.754
So, I am making hybrid fruit people,
out of these imperfect foods.

20:13.837 --> 20:17.674
I love oddly-shaped things.
I don't like perfection.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.969
So, even with the addition
of this, um, new challenge,

20:21.053 --> 20:23.722
I think it's very clear by seeing how much
we have done,

20:23.805 --> 20:25.766
we can lap the young'uns.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.227
This is a very big jicama.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.647
So, I'm quickly working on the teacups.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.858
Lindsey, right now, is making
the gelatin bubbles

20:35.150 --> 20:37.486
that will be coming out of the tap.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.489
I am making the body of the teacups out
of jicama.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.700
I use the knife to get rid of like
the bulk of what I don't want.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.620
And then I come in with the micro plane
and shape it.

20:48.914 --> 20:53.252
RYSE: <i>I am making the foot of the teacup</i>
<i>out of Japanese eggplant.</i>

20:53.585 --> 20:56.880
It's not really quite as belled
as I want it to be at the bottom.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.132
In the movie,
the bottom of the teacup,

20:59.216 --> 21:02.552
it almost has a like a little skirt,
little foot to it.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.889
And these ones are more like
a pants situation going on.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.226
Just wondering if I can maybe fudge it,
if I carve it out

21:09.351 --> 21:12.479
of butternut squash and then cover
with a eggplant peel.

21:13.063 --> 21:17.067
RYSE:<i> My brain is going a thousand miles</i>
<i>a minute. We'll figure it out.</i>

21:17.526 --> 21:19.820
-Hey, hey, hey, ladies!
-BENNY: Hi, guys.

21:19.945 --> 21:23.240
So, I'm excited because I'm seeing
this stove come together, girls.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.117
-ERIN: Finally! (CHUCKLES)
-KEKE: How are you feeling?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.077
Is that kinda taking away any nervousness?

21:27.160 --> 21:28.954
Or are you guys still kinda like,
"Okay..." (HESITATES)

21:29.079 --> 21:31.456
RYSE:
I mean, a little bit because it's scary.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.333
-(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
-(CHIMING)

21:33.417 --> 21:34.418
KEKE: Uh-oh.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.128
-You guys! So, wait a minute.
-No.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.212
The plot thickened.

21:37.337 --> 21:42.259
How do you feel about tying in
these imperfect fruits to your foodscape?

21:42.426 --> 21:43.760
LINDSEY:
<i>We're hoping to try to incorporate</i>

21:43.844 --> 21:46.471
<i>some of the extra vegetables in our treats</i>

21:46.596 --> 21:49.308
<i>that Chip and his friends</i>
<i>have been making.</i>

21:49.391 --> 21:52.561
<i>It's a good way to add color.</i>
<i>It's a good way to add texture.</i>

21:52.894 --> 21:55.689
Obviously, we've spoke a lot
about the size of your foodscape.

21:55.772 --> 21:58.358
But aside from that, is there anything
that's concerning you?

21:58.442 --> 22:01.653
-We need more petals.
-ALL: (LAUGH)

22:01.778 --> 22:05.407
Yes. Exactly. I think everybody here
can agree on that.

22:06.992 --> 22:08.660
MARK: I'm gonna do the floor right now
so that can dry out a little bit.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.496
-NANCY: Okay. Yeah, the floor's priority.
-Yeah, I know.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.915
MARK:<i> So, the reason we're using</i>
<i>marbleized fondant for this</i>

22:13.999 --> 22:15.751
is because it will dry and set up fast.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.838
<i>And it'll be a nice pattern that</i>
<i>really adds some character to the floor.</i>

22:19.963 --> 22:22.966
<i>We wanna make sure that</i>
<i>it looks seamless with our display.</i>

22:23.258 --> 22:27.179
<i>Sixty-four tiles, 12 by 12, it's a lot</i>
<i>of space to cover.</i>

22:27.262 --> 22:29.765
JEAN: It's looking really good, Mark.
Seriously.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.600
-Nancy, how does her face look?
-Yeah?

22:32.059 --> 22:37.105
I'm in love with it.
Right now, the floor is mostly done.

22:39.024 --> 22:44.321
<i>Fifi and Cogsworth, they're in good shape.</i>
<i>The wardrobe is pretty much on track.</i>

22:44.529 --> 22:46.490
-MARK: Just spot me.
-NANCY: I don't want to...

22:46.656 --> 22:48.075
Yeah, just slide it up there.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.619
-We've got it!
-MARK: Drop it.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.080
-JEAN: Just spot me.
-Okay.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.750
-MARK: Yay!
-Okay.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.920
Even though everyone's pieces
are really large,

23:00.212 --> 23:03.590
I think we have more focused
detail pieces, you know?

23:03.882 --> 23:05.258
MARK: I agree.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.968
Look at the chocolate work
coming together.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.971
Look at the flowers opening up, you know?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.848
BRANDON: I put a zucchini in ice water
like this,

23:12.099 --> 23:13.767
they come out looking like this.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.604
And then I'm gonna toothpick a carrot
in the center for a stamen.

23:17.687 --> 23:22.109
And then I have all kinds of other things
that curl in water, like, celery, squash.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.319
And we're gonna use it to decorate
our whole piece.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.531
-And I know I have a headless dog now.
-DOMINIC: I know. No, I can...

23:27.614 --> 23:29.241
-It's coming together.
-DOMINIC: We can see it.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.159
YAYA:
I'm feeling really good about Sultan.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.537
I'm gonna add some gold tassels
around him.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.498
Once you add all the details,
you're gonna see him come to life.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.459
-BRANDON: Are the arms hardening up?
-DOMINIC: Yeah, arms are good.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.503
BRANDON: All right, guys, I think
I have enough melons

23:41.586 --> 23:43.380
to start filling our, uh, arch.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.881
You guys ready to pull out
the secret weapon?

23:44.965 --> 23:46.800
-Yeah, I think we're ready.
-BRANDON: <i>We're basically gonna make</i>

23:46.883 --> 23:50.262
<i>a giant shish kebab of watermelons,</i>
<i>honeydews,</i>

23:50.470 --> 23:53.890
<i>all the different fruits and vegetables</i>
<i>on a four-foot-tall archway.</i>

23:54.015 --> 23:56.685
All right. These ones... This is where
the juice starts happening.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.855
This is actually their biggest moment
in this build.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.858
-YAYA: That looks so good already.
-Yeah, it's gonna be sick.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.695
I just hope that the entire piece is able
to hold the weight.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.322
AMIRAH: And now, as he's stacking it,
look, it's dripping.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.700
It's just creating a whole puddle
down there.

24:14.077 --> 24:16.079
-(CHIMING)
-RYSE: No!

24:16.413 --> 24:18.248
-Oh no! Oh gosh!
-No!

24:18.498 --> 24:19.791
-RYSE: Cover faster.
-ERIN: Cover faster.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.626
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

24:22.127 --> 24:25.422
All right, Bouchey-baby.
Let's... Let's get you covered.

24:28.383 --> 24:32.137
We are starting to cover Chef Bouche
with our nori sheets.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.974
He's got different shades of metal
that he's made of, so, we're hoping

24:36.099 --> 24:40.437
the texture of the nori would kind of
mimic that cast iron.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.522
Let's talk about Weirdoughs.

24:42.856 --> 24:46.443
I got to be honest
that I'm really scared for them.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.403
(GASPS) Shoot!

24:48.487 --> 24:51.698
KEKE: They have a lot of cool elements.
But I do feel that they're nervous.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.950
-RYSE: Whoop! Dang it!
-I do feel like they're...

24:54.075 --> 24:55.285
-Yes.
-...you know crunched against time.

24:55.368 --> 24:59.372
To build such a huge piece.
It's still a lot of work to do.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.458
-KEKE: Yeah.
-AMIRAH: But when you look at the art

25:01.541 --> 25:04.336
and the depth in story,
they can still wow us.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.880
I mean, that would be the greatest
comeback story, honestly.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.466
RYSE: All right. Ladies, I feel like
we're catching up here.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.344
Let's move onto the Creative Villains.
I'm so happy they got

25:12.469 --> 25:14.054
-the watermelon arches done.
-AMIRAH: Totally.

25:14.137 --> 25:16.681
The one thing that worries me
is that water.

25:16.765 --> 25:20.018
It needs to stay fresh.
And it's the first thing they put on.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.728
That's the last thing I would have put on.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.897
They have so many details
that we're yet to see.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.982
I don't know that they have enough time
to actually do that.

25:26.149 --> 25:29.528
-KEKE: So, I mean, Food Fanatics, y'all.
-You have to be very careful

25:29.653 --> 25:32.239
in the way that you're gonna apply
the airbrushing layers.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.659
Because too much can take away
a little bit of the natural color,

25:35.784 --> 25:38.328
and the natural beauty, and the texture
that they already have placed.

25:38.453 --> 25:41.957
I feel like they're taking something
so iconic, like Wardrobe,

25:42.040 --> 25:45.126
-and just filling it with something else.
-Rose petals continue to fall

25:45.252 --> 25:47.462
-and our food artists continue to build.
-Yeah.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.006
-RYSE: Beast-mode engage.
-ERIN: Team beast-mode!

25:51.174 --> 25:53.385
-RYSE: Yes!
-ERIN: I got it.

25:54.386 --> 25:55.762
Yank the sheet tray out, go.

25:56.429 --> 25:57.472
ERIN: We did it!

25:57.597 --> 26:00.559
He looks so much more like Chef Bouche
when he's wearing his hat.

26:00.642 --> 26:04.771
I felt the weight of the hat come off
of my shoulders.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.731
Wow!

26:06.940 --> 26:08.316
We gotta stay in beast-mode.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.818
Faster, faster, faster.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.237
(CHIMING)

26:12.487 --> 26:15.949
There's only one petal left on the rose!

26:16.074 --> 26:19.202
That means you've only got one hour
to finish your foodscape.

26:19.369 --> 26:22.872
So, get a move on, or Belle's BFF
may as well be thrown

26:22.956 --> 26:25.375
-to the wolves outside the castle!
-Pressure's on.

26:25.542 --> 26:30.297
-MARK: Get the stuff on the display.
-NANCY: Yeah. Drop it like it's hot.

26:31.423 --> 26:35.844
<i>We have three characters.</i>
<i>And we have such a variety of food.</i>

26:35.927 --> 26:39.180
If I were judging it... (CHUCKLES)
...certainly, we'd win.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.808
-ERIN: What do you want me to do?
-Maybe get his mustache on.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.853
We finally have
Bouche's main structure done.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.563
And now, we gotta do all the detail work.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.232
ERIN: <i>So, Lindsey is baking</i>
<i>croissant dough</i>

26:49.316 --> 26:51.735
<i>into the shape of Bouche's mustache,</i>

26:51.818 --> 26:53.653
<i>eyebrows, and nose.</i>

26:53.737 --> 26:55.071
You can take it, Bouche.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.949
<i>The body is covered in nori seaweed.</i>

26:58.074 --> 27:00.118
BRANDON:
Dom, you gotta get that hat up, man.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.663
DOMINIC: <i>With Coat Rack, his hat,</i>
<i>we really wanted to add some color.</i>

27:03.747 --> 27:05.081
<i>So, I sprayed it with cocoa butter.</i>

27:05.165 --> 27:06.958
What do you think, Yaya? Now I see it
in the light, that's...

27:07.042 --> 27:10.629
-Oh! That is so nice!
-DOMINIC: That pops. Are you ready?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.339
So, you're gonna heat up the base
of the hat.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.090
-You're gonna heat up the top of this.
-DOMINIC: Yes.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.926
You're gonna put them together,
and I'm gonna spray it as you put it down.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.970
-DOMINIC: Yes.
-So, look at Dom.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.348
He has to be extremely careful with that.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.641
No, if we heat it more...

27:22.724 --> 27:23.933
BRANDON: No, we need to
heat it up more, or it...

27:24.017 --> 27:25.518
YAYA: Yeah, if you heat it more,
it will soften the chocolate.

27:25.602 --> 27:29.147
-Yeah. Better heat it more then.
-Mind your fingers.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.858
(SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

27:32.150 --> 27:33.610
DOMINIC: Add some support
with freeze spray.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.071
Yeah.

27:38.531 --> 27:39.532
Yes.

27:41.701 --> 27:42.786
NANCY: They're having so much fun

27:42.911 --> 27:44.913
the kitchen that things
have gotten out of hand,

27:44.996 --> 27:47.582
-and they've just made a really big mess.
-You cool if I just put a bunch of fruit

27:47.666 --> 27:48.958
-down here along with this stuff...
-NANCY: Yep.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.128
-...so, it's mixed in? Random fruit.
-JEAN: Well, 'cause it's a mess.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.089
This looks like a fine breakfast brunch.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.465
-Ah, it does, doesn't it?
-It does.

27:55.590 --> 27:56.883
JEAN:
I think it looks really, really good.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.009
-I really do.
-MARK: Yes!

27:58.510 --> 28:01.763
-What's happening?
-RYSE: The Food Fanatics are already done.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.431
DOMINIC:
Yaya, how you doing with the Sultan?

28:03.515 --> 28:05.725
Good. Just adding a few final touches.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.018
(MUSIC PLAYING)

29:43.114 --> 29:46.409
We're so excited to get into all of this.
I mean, you guys are the only team,

29:46.493 --> 29:50.663
I think, we've ever seen that actually
got done a little bit early.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.540
-I mean, so, how do you feel?
-Amazing.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.667
I mean, it's just incredible what
we created, you know,

29:54.751 --> 29:59.297
out of all this food. It's just...
I'm flabbergasted, happy, relieved, done.

29:59.798 --> 30:03.384
Okay, well, walk me through the story
that your foodscape is telling.

NANCY: <i>Belle's best friend,</i>
<i>she's just at her wit's end.</i>

<i>So, Cogsworth, and Feather Duster,</i>
<i>and Wardrobe</i>

30:16.564 --> 30:20.944
<i>are cooking up a fun brunch for her.</i>
<i>They are just letting loose,</i>

30:21.027 --> 30:22.570
<i>and they've spilled a little.</i>

30:23.780 --> 30:27.534
<i>And then Wardrobe, she comes into this</i>
<i>enchanted kitchen,</i>

30:27.826 --> 30:31.329
<i>and she transforms into a pantry.</i>

30:31.871 --> 30:35.542
<i>The wardrobe, she's primarily flatbread</i>
<i>and decorative cookies.</i>

-The plot thickened.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.182
So, Feather Duster is...

30:51.266 --> 30:54.018
<i>her base is made of napa cabbage</i>
<i>and red cabbage.</i>

30:54.143 --> 30:56.104

<i>and add some detail.</i>

31:19.502 --> 31:21.713
We're all so familiar
with the dinner scene.

31:21.921 --> 31:25.383
And I feel like you guys are giving us
a daytime feel to the castle.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.594
These characters would have brunch.

31:27.719 --> 31:32.181
And I have to say, Cogsworth is one
of the most beautiful pieces

31:32.265 --> 31:34.726
that I have seen. I love, love, love

31:34.809 --> 31:37.854
the way that Feather Duster, is,
sort of doing this,

31:38.021 --> 31:41.983
and she has this sassy face.
You've captured her movement so well.

31:42.108 --> 31:45.486
But out of all the characters
in the castle,

31:45.612 --> 31:50.366
Cogsworth and Feather Duster
are the two least likely to make a mess.

31:50.533 --> 31:55.204
Feather Duster is literally cleaning,
and Cogsworth is just like, the strict,

31:55.330 --> 31:57.415
keep this castle tip-top shape.

31:57.790 --> 32:00.668
And Wardrobe has been turned
into a pantry,

32:00.752 --> 32:04.756
but I feel like you could've still done
a lot more clothing into it,

32:04.839 --> 32:07.675
just because it is traditionally Wardrobe.

32:07.842 --> 32:10.345
So, I feel like that's something
that's throwing me off a little bit.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.555
-They're enchanted.
-(LAUGHING)

32:12.931 --> 32:18.478
The only thing that's bothering me
is the floor. I think the color is bright,

32:18.561 --> 32:21.606
<i>and it, kind of, takes away</i>
<i>from the other elements</i>

32:21.689 --> 32:25.485
<i>that are placed on the actual floor.</i>
<i>Also, you can be messy,</i>

32:25.568 --> 32:27.028
<i>but in an organized way.</i>

32:27.487 --> 32:31.449
Now, if you are going to replicate
an original character,

32:31.532 --> 32:35.411
you better nail it. In this case,
they look very recognizable.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.747
<i>The carving of the book, stunning.</i>

32:37.997 --> 32:41.292
<i>Details of the pages</i>
<i>on the side turned out really great.</i>

32:41.542 --> 32:44.420
I love how you guys used
the different shapes of the bread,

32:44.504 --> 32:47.256
<i>and the different types of the bread</i>
<i>to create the drawers</i>

32:47.340 --> 32:52.553

you work, I have to be honest.

<i>And they're trying to cheer up</i>
<i>Belle's best friend.</i>

33:28.715 --> 33:30.800
<i>So, they decided, "Well, you know what?</i>
<i>Let's have a snowball fight."</i>

33:30.883 --> 33:33.052
<i>Sultan, he's a puppy.</i>
<i>He's a little mischievous,</i>

<i>so, he's throwing snowballs at Coat Rack</i>

<i>and block them out.</i>
<i>So, that's exactly what we see here.</i>

33:38.474 --> 33:41.561
So, when we think Coat Rack,
I thought all chocolate. The base of it,

33:41.686 --> 33:45.064
<i>we got modelling chocolate. And then</i>
<i>the structure of it, tempered chocolate.</i>

33:45.148 --> 33:47.942
<i>The hooks are made with cocoa butter</i>
<i>and cocoa powder.</i>

33:48.026 --> 33:50.903

Pure perfection.

34:30.276 --> 34:34.864
that you had to go to build
those tiny details,

34:34.989 --> 34:36.616
just mind blowing.

34:37.533 --> 34:40.286
And then, of course, the plot thickened,
and you guys had to change

these imperfect, or should I say beastly,

34:43.206 --> 34:45.124

with this story is the characters. Sultan,

If we rub his belly, will it laugh?

He's playful.

<i>He's in the garden.</i>
<i>He's about to throw a snowball.</i>

35:15.947 --> 35:18.866
<i>He is in action. And it's not just</i>
<i>the fact that you have him tilting up.</i>

35:18.991 --> 35:23.121
It's the tail when he's excited, right?
Because after all, it is a puppy.

<i>it's in motion. It's in play.</i>
<i>It's magical.</i>

and placed him in this position.

well done.

AMIRAH: <i>With Coat Rack, I love that silky,</i>
<i>smooth look.</i>

<i>But in this case, I just wish</i>
<i>I saw a little bit more of that movement,</i>

35:43.391 --> 35:45.977
sort of, like you have done
with Sultan here.

35:46.310 --> 35:49.564
I agree with Amirah a little bit. I would
probably would have placed him just

35:49.647 --> 35:52.733
<i>in a different position to give</i>
<i>the illusion of emotion.</i>

You guys were definitely
up against the clock in a lot of moments

36:14.839 --> 36:17.758
because you took on such
a big foodscape design.

I mean, we probably might pick
a slightly smaller character next time.

Chef Bouche wanted to

36:32.148 --> 36:36.152
<i>create a true Be-Our-Guest experience</i>
<i>for Belle's best friend,</i>

36:36.235 --> 36:40.364
<i>so decided to make a plethora</i>
<i>of amuse-bouches for her.</i>

36:40.448 --> 36:42.909
<i>Because when you're bored,</i>
<i>what do you wanna do?</i>

36:43.117 --> 36:47.622
<i>You wanna eat. And Chip being a kid,</i>
<i>they love to help in the kitchen.</i>

36:47.830 --> 36:51.667
<i>And they make a mess,</i>
<i>but they have fun while they're doing it.</i>

36:52.001 --> 36:57.006
So, for the stove, we used corn husk,
we used cake, we used rice cereal treats,

36:57.089 --> 36:59.675
<i>croissants, nori, cheese, lasagna.</i>

37:00.259 --> 37:03.221
<i>To make Chip and all of his friends</i>
<i>we used jicama,</i>

37:03.346 --> 37:08.142
<i>butternut squash, eggplant,</i>
<i>two kinds of gum, and black licorice.</i>

37:08.267 --> 37:11.354
This little guy down here
is actually eating some of his grey stuff

37:11.437 --> 37:13.814
<i>that he just created</i>
<i>for Belle's best friend,</i>

37:13.898 --> 37:17.526
<i>which is hummus,</i>
<i>and chocolate sandwich cookies.</i>

37:17.610 --> 37:21.239
Well, guys. Chef Bouche,
I freaking love him!

37:21.322 --> 37:27.245
It's just amazing, how you guys
were able to create this old rustic,

37:27.328 --> 37:30.706
-black technique. That is a seaweed, no?
-Yeah.

37:30.998 --> 37:34.835
It's stunning. It gives you
that natural texture of metal bronze.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.964
<i>And just the simple light effect</i>
<i>inside the oven,</i>

37:38.047 --> 37:39.840
it's just taking you to another level.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.635
AMIRAH: <i>To me, the most creative thing</i>
<i>that you've done</i>

37:42.718 --> 37:45.471
<i>is that you've actually taken</i>
<i>that story and brought it to life.</i>

37:45.596 --> 37:46.973
<i>You see the trail...</i>

37:47.098 --> 37:50.017
<i>BENNY: And you can see how</i>
<i>they are interacting between each other,</i>

37:50.101 --> 37:53.229
-and how much fun they're having.
-And that part really shows.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.900
The one thing I would've done differently
is the grey stuff.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.278
I'm just a little bummed that it's more,
like, brown stuff.

38:00.486 --> 38:04.156
-It actually darkened as it sat.
-As it sat. Yeah.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.409
AMIRAH:
<i>If the grey stuff was actually grey,</i>

38:06.492 --> 38:09.203
that would've been the literal cherry
on top.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.747
It's very healthy grey stuff. Okay?

38:12.832 --> 38:15.668
AMIRAH: <i>Such a brilliant choice</i>
<i>to use that for the teacups,</i>

38:15.751 --> 38:19.505
<i>because not only does</i>
<i>it have this very china texture to me...</i>

38:19.755 --> 38:22.008
-but they don't change color, they look...
-Yeah, you're right.

38:22.091 --> 38:26.095
...perfect. I mean, that is just such
a smart choice of using a root vegetable

38:26.178 --> 38:28.180
<i>that isn't going to oxidize over time.</i>

38:28.264 --> 38:32.435
There's a lot of hidden beastly produce
in there.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.978
Front and center, we got Chip

38:34.061 --> 38:37.356
-with his Buddha hand party hat on.
-(LAUGHING)

38:37.481 --> 38:42.153
RYSE: <i>There's a strawberry rose on top</i>
<i>of a celeriac tart.</i>

38:42.236 --> 38:44.113
ERIN: <i>I braided the stems</i>

38:44.238 --> 38:47.283
<i>from the beet hanging</i>
<i>over the sides of the bowls.</i>

38:47.366 --> 38:50.161
Yes. I was suspecting, guys, for you
to include them in a more, like,

38:50.244 --> 38:53.456
artistic way
to create something beautiful.

38:53.622 --> 38:56.208
Not just place them as if another piece
of food.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.503
You know you guys really went beast-mode.
Y'all got it done.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.797
-So, wishing you the best of luck.
-Thank you.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.424
-Thank you.
-See you guys in a bit.

39:03.507 --> 39:04.884
-See you, guys.
-RYSE: Thank you, guys.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.510
KEKE: Okay, so I mean let's talk about it.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.888
We really have seen
some really great work out here.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.473
So, Amirah, I'm gonna start with you.

39:10.556 --> 39:14.310
Part of the Disney magic is the story,
and how they're developed as characters.

39:14.393 --> 39:16.187
And not just what they look like.

39:16.270 --> 39:18.898
So, I feel like,
that's very important for me.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.484
Technique wise, it's just like,
so many beautiful

39:21.567 --> 39:23.110
techniques in all of the pieces.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.030
So, it's just, like, really hard,
and what direction

39:26.113 --> 39:27.740
you really wanted to go with this.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.576
-My heart is beating in my throat.
-I know, right?

39:30.785 --> 39:33.329
BENNY: Now one team did bring more emotion

39:33.412 --> 39:35.998
and animation to their foodscape
than the others.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.417
What are they saying? Can you hear them?

39:40.169 --> 39:41.295
You guys know who it's gonna be?

39:41.462 --> 39:43.005
-Yes. I think so.
-I think so.

39:43.464 --> 39:44.590
KEKE: Let's go.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.178
(MAGICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

39:49.345 --> 39:50.888
RYSE: Oh. That's so beautiful.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.932
-It's so beautiful.
-Wow.

39:53.015 --> 39:54.517
-Cool. Look at the waterfall.
-Oh, wow.

39:54.600 --> 39:58.854
As you can tell, we love your creations.
And we think Belle's BFF

39:58.979 --> 40:02.650
will adore them too. But only one can win.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.860
MARK: Look at that!

40:05.611 --> 40:06.612
-Oh, wow.
-Wow.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.155
It's like a bubble shower.

40:08.656 --> 40:09.698
(LAUGHING)

40:11.659 --> 40:13.119
So many bubbles.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.204
I got one right on my head.

40:15.287 --> 40:18.249
KEKE: The team that created the most

40:18.374 --> 40:22.336
Foodtastic <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>
foodscape is...

40:22.795 --> 40:24.255
Oh, my God.

40:25.798 --> 40:27.591
Is she going for that big one?

40:28.509 --> 40:30.928
JEAN: Oh, it came down.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.849

-KEKE: Congratulations, guys.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.495

40:56.579 --> 41:00.541
-We just won <i>Foodtastic!</i>
-Even the backs are Mickeys!

41:00.749 --> 41:03.043
ERIN: <i>The validation and the recognition.</i>

41:03.210 --> 41:06.046
This is one of the things you work
for in this industry.

41:06.130 --> 41:09.842
<i>This is a new level,</i>
<i>and it's pretty exciting to be here.</i>

41:09.967 --> 41:13.012
This looks pretty sweet with our outfits,
too.

41:13.095 --> 41:16.307
-Oh! That's special.
-KEKE: And now, remember,

41:16.390 --> 41:18.350
never stop playing with your food.

NARRATOR:<i> As celebrations continue,</i>

41:20.561 --> 41:24.482

41:25.524 --> 41:27.860
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

41:28.819 --> 41:33.491
Wow! Not only is this castle full
of more surprises than I ever imagined,

41:33.657 --> 41:37.453
but you also proved to me
that imperfections are beautiful,

41:37.536 --> 41:39.163
just in their own way.

41:39.246 --> 41:40.456
NARRATOR: <i>You see, </i>mon chéri,

41:40.539 --> 41:42.583
<i>what you learn</i>
<i>when you put your service to the test.</i>

41:42.666 --> 41:45.878
You really
are a full-service enchanted castle.

41:45.961 --> 41:50.883
I know my very own Prince Charming
is out there, imperfections and all.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.761
NARRATOR:<i> Exactly. And now, you know</i>
<i>that it's our imperfections</i>

41:53.844 --> 41:55.971
<i>-that make us beautiful.</i>
-I really do.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.974
And speaking of imperfections
that are beautiful,

41:59.058 --> 42:00.768
is the kitchen staff still here?

42:00.851 --> 42:03.521
I could really
go for some more of that grey stuff.

42:04.146 --> 42:05.231
<i>Au revoir!</i>
