WEBVTT

00:58.119 --> 01:00.960
GOING TO TIJUANA
TO TRY OUT OUR ACT!

01:06.359 --> 01:08.000
-Barry.
-Sally?

01:08.079 --> 01:11.239
You told me you can break into
Diane's house and scare her.

01:11.319 --> 01:13.959
-Yeah.
-I need you to do that to Natalie.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.760
BARRY
Season 3, Episode 8

01:15.840 --> 01:19.680
Johnson slipping and picked off!
Looking for blockers, on his feet!

01:20.280 --> 01:24.599
-We would like you to do Our Town.
-With us?

01:24.920 --> 01:28.200
It'll be starring you, of course,
and your favorite students,

01:28.280 --> 01:30.599
and we can market your
class around it.

01:30.680 --> 01:36.319
The audience will watch kids
audition and get cast.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.760
And the final show will be
a live performance shot out

01:39.840 --> 01:43.879
to movie theaters
across the country.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.879
This is live theater at the movies.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.840
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna do Annie's play.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.439
-Gene.
-You wrote a play?

01:55.000 --> 01:56.480
What's it called?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.040
Chrome Fuck Number Nine.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.000
It was the late '70s.
It's very experimental.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.200
Sorry. I have to take this.

02:06.599 --> 02:10.479
-Crone Fuck Number Nine?
-Chrome Fuck Number Nine.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.960
-Like, like on a trailer hitch.
-Chrome Fuck.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.159
-Hello?
-Gene, how we doin'?

02:17.479 --> 02:19.080
We're good.

02:19.159 --> 02:22.639
Good.
I'm callin' because I wanna talk.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.800
About Janice.
Can you come over?

02:25.599 --> 02:29.199
-No, my schedule is just packed.
-How about now?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.919
-Now?
-Within the hour.

02:33.800 --> 02:37.960
-Okay.
-It takes 17 minutes, with traffic.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.280
Okay. Bye.

02:49.039 --> 02:50.560
Is this yours?

02:54.960 --> 02:57.840
-The fuck is that?
-We ran your prints.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.360
You're Monroe Fuches.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.120
We found your tooth
at Goran Pazar's murder scene.

03:05.159 --> 03:07.479
We know you work
for the Chechen mob.

03:10.199 --> 03:11.719
I'll take a lawyer.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.800
Is Albert still not answering?

03:16.879 --> 03:20.080
Haven't seen him since he left
and cocked his gun in front of us.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.280
He's probably out seein' the sights.
I wish he would take me with him.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.000
What did Fuches say to him?

03:28.159 --> 03:30.120
Here you go, Mister Johnson.

03:32.159 --> 03:34.039
Here you go, Mister Fuches.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.639
I'm the Raven.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.240
The what?

03:41.599 --> 03:43.759
It took you 20 minutes
to get here.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.960
I had to explain leaving a brunch.
I got here as quickly as I could.

03:48.039 --> 03:50.719
Three minutes. I guess I was right.

03:53.439 --> 03:56.599
Come on, I wanna show you something
in the garage.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.719
-Do you love my daughter?
-Yes.

04:19.040 --> 04:23.000
-You love my daughter.
-Of course. Yes, I do.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.120
You love my daughter.

04:28.839 --> 04:33.439
-Jim, l just told you.
-Do you, Gene, love my daughter?

04:35.360 --> 04:38.920
-I don't know what you want me to say.
-Her name was Janice.

04:40.319 --> 04:42.560
-Her name, Gene, was Janice.
-I know.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.079
-Her name was Janice.
-I know.

04:49.360 --> 04:52.439
-Her name was Janice Moss.
-I know. Janice Moss.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.199
-Detective Janice Moss.
-I love Detective Janice Moss.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.480
Do you love Barry Berkman?

05:05.720 --> 05:08.319
Do you love Barry Berkman?

05:09.360 --> 05:12.920
-Jim, I...
-Do you love Barry Berkman?

05:13.560 --> 05:16.439
I care for all of my students.

05:18.079 --> 05:20.240
Do you love Barry Berkman?

05:23.079 --> 05:25.639
Do you love Barry Berkman?

05:28.279 --> 05:31.240
-Do you love Barry Berkman?
-No.

05:31.319 --> 05:33.839
-Do you love Barry Berkman?
-No, I don't.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.399
Did Barry Berkman love my daughter?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.879
Did Barry Berkman love my daughter?

05:55.759 --> 06:01.079
Look at a man when he talks to you!
Did he love my daughter, Gene?

06:01.959 --> 06:05.560
-My baby girl, Janice Moss?
-No.

06:10.639 --> 06:13.519
-Why are you protecting him?
-I'm not.

06:14.319 --> 06:18.839
-Why are you protecting him?
-I'm not protecting Barry Berkman.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.439
-Did you love my daughter?!
-Yes. I loved your daughter.

06:24.279 --> 06:26.839
Why are you protecting
Barry Berkman?

06:36.319 --> 06:39.759
I brought you into the fold.
This is how you repay me!

06:39.839 --> 06:41.680
I peeled your carrots for you.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.759
Cunt!

06:43.839 --> 06:45.560
Jesus.

06:45.639 --> 06:50.480
I've drawn a map of her house.
You'll break in while she's asleep.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.360
First, take a picture.
Send it to her the next day

06:53.439 --> 06:55.959
with something scary written
underneath. I'll come up with it.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.240
-Sally.
-What?

06:57.319 --> 07:00.839
-Phase two, break into her car.
-Sally, you don't wanna do this.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.279
What? You said you'd do it
to Diane. Why is this different?

07:04.360 --> 07:08.399
Because I know
where I'm going after all this.

07:08.480 --> 07:09.920
After what?

07:10.240 --> 07:11.839
When I die,

07:11.920 --> 07:17.040
I know where I'm going. I don't want
you to go to the same place.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.680
What fucking place?
I'm talking about Natalie's house.

07:21.079 --> 07:23.959
No, that's where it starts.
Don't you understand?

07:24.920 --> 07:28.040
-We can't do that. You can't do it.
-Barry.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.279
What the fuck?
Did you poke me in the eye?

08:45.879 --> 08:47.519
Fuckin' bitch!

08:49.679 --> 08:51.399
What is that, metal?

08:55.600 --> 09:00.960
What the fuck did you put in my eye?
Fuck, you fuckin' bitch.

09:08.639 --> 09:13.320
-What the fuck did you do...
-You piece of shit!

09:31.360 --> 09:34.240
-Sally! Stop!
-You fucking...

09:37.080 --> 09:38.799
Come here.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.759
It's okay. Look at me!

09:41.559 --> 09:43.159
Look at me.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.519
Look at me.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.639
I did this.

09:52.519 --> 09:54.000
Listen!

09:55.000 --> 09:58.440
-I did this, okay? I did this.
-I did this.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.600
-Who did this?
-I did this.

10:00.679 --> 10:02.120
No, I did this.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.799
I did this. Look at me!

10:04.519 --> 10:07.080
I did this.
Say, "Barry did this."

10:07.159 --> 10:10.960
-Barry did this.
-Barry did this. Say it again.

10:11.039 --> 10:14.840
Barry did this.
Barry did this.

10:14.919 --> 10:17.480
-Say it again.
-Barry did this.

10:17.559 --> 10:20.399
-That's it. You're gonna go home.
-Home.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.080
You're gonna go home.
You were never here.

10:24.639 --> 10:26.799
Okay. Go.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.440
Hank!

10:39.200 --> 10:42.159
-Hank!
-What? What is it?

10:42.960 --> 10:44.399
I'm free.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.080
We are going to overpower
the gunmen when they come in.

10:49.159 --> 10:52.120
-Then we will release you.
-Okay.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.600
How did you guys get out
of other handcuffs?

11:07.159 --> 11:08.919
No, please.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.519
No! Look, I am still handcuffed!

11:13.600 --> 11:15.759
No, please. Please!

11:20.720 --> 11:24.120
No! We want to stop!
Please get us out of here!

11:24.200 --> 11:26.639
-No! Please!
-Fuck! No!

11:26.720 --> 11:28.240
No, please!

14:41.840 --> 14:43.279
Look at him dancing.

14:44.120 --> 14:48.559
Look at his face, his muscles.
Look at him, Cristobal!

14:57.720 --> 15:00.559
Don't stop.
Take a good look.

15:00.639 --> 15:02.759
Do you like this, Cristobal?

15:02.840 --> 15:04.919
Do you like this?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.480
Do you want more?

15:21.440 --> 15:22.799
Gustavo. Piano.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.480
Piano!

15:29.360 --> 15:31.840
-I look in your eyes...
-Shut up, you idiot!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.559
Get up, Papito.

15:37.799 --> 15:39.519
Cristobal, look at me.

15:41.039 --> 15:42.679
Look at my lips.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.879
Look at my neck.

15:50.159 --> 15:53.720
Cristobal, look at me!
Papito, please.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.879
Touch me!
Don't you like it?

15:57.759 --> 16:01.559
Caress my skin.
Caress me!

16:20.960 --> 16:22.360
Cristobal?

16:24.679 --> 16:26.039
Cristobal?

16:27.960 --> 16:29.279
Hi.

17:18.799 --> 17:20.160
Berkman!

17:39.920 --> 17:41.839
What are you doing, Berkman?

17:47.839 --> 17:50.119
How much you get
for that asshole?

17:54.720 --> 17:56.200
How much they pay?

17:58.599 --> 18:00.480
How much did you get for Chris?

18:07.279 --> 18:08.720
How much, Berkman?

18:10.279 --> 18:12.440
How much did they give you
for Chris?!

18:13.680 --> 18:15.759
'Cause he was an innocent, Barry.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.559
You gotta tell me right now,
Barry.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
Why? Why Chris?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.000
He was a sweetheart.
He looked up to you.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.319
But you had to take him out, right?
You need to tell me, Barry.

18:36.359 --> 18:37.920
Why Chris?

18:43.640 --> 18:45.039
Tell me, Barry!

18:46.480 --> 18:47.799
Tell me!

18:48.960 --> 18:50.599
Tell me right now!

18:52.680 --> 18:57.519
Don't just sit there, you tell me!
You need to tell me!

18:57.920 --> 19:00.119
Enough! Enough!

19:00.839 --> 19:02.279
Shut up!

19:15.279 --> 19:16.519
Don't.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.680
God, Barry. Barry.

19:30.839 --> 19:32.799
Barry, listen to me.
Calm down.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.039
I got a daughter.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.480
Her name is Elsie. She's eight.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.079
She wouldn't be here
if you hadn't saved my life.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.920
I know evil, Barry.

19:55.359 --> 19:57.079
And you're not evil.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.640
But this has to stop.

20:04.839 --> 20:06.720
All of it's gotta stop.

20:09.759 --> 20:11.119
Hear me?

20:14.759 --> 20:17.119
Starting now.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.720
-You got nothin' to worry about.
-What happens now?

20:53.279 --> 20:56.599
I'll pick up some shit from my house
and I'll come get you.

20:57.240 --> 21:00.079
-Where are we going?
-I don't know. Pick a place.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.839
Sally...

21:05.839 --> 21:07.319
I love you.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.240
Love you, too.

21:18.279 --> 21:21.920
Passengers Rodriguez and Savage,
please report to gate 19B.

21:23.079 --> 21:27.240
Passengers Rodriguez and Savage,
please report to gate 19B.

21:33.079 --> 21:36.119
-Hello?
-Mr Berkman, this is Jim Moss.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.480
I just talked to Gene Cousineau
about my daughter's death.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.400
I'd like to speak with you about it.
Are you available?

21:44.480 --> 21:46.039
No, I'm not.

21:47.319 --> 21:49.319
I need you to come to my home.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.240
-Can I call you tomorrow?
-I need you to come now.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.920
Look, I gotta call you back.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.559
-He wants to take us down, Barry.
-What'd you say to him?

22:13.279 --> 22:16.720
He's gonna ruin me.
I can't have that.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.519
Where are you?

22:19.599 --> 22:22.039
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to do.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.960
Wait, Mr Cousineau,
where are you?

22:25.680 --> 22:29.319
I gotta do this, Barry.
I don't know what else to do.

23:05.799 --> 23:07.440
You have a gun on you?

23:07.519 --> 23:09.599
-A motherfuckin' gun?
-No!

23:10.000 --> 23:12.759
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-He lives right there.

23:13.279 --> 23:16.119
-Are you nuts?
-I don't know what else to do.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.640
-Were you gonna shoot him?
-You don't know what he's capable of.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.599
Barry, he'll ruin me. He'll destroy
everything I've worked for.

23:25.279 --> 23:28.440
-Get out of here. I'll go talk to him.
-You can't.

23:28.880 --> 23:32.559
He only wants revenge.
You cannot talk to him. He's crazy.

23:33.799 --> 23:36.400
He knows everything, Barry.

23:38.319 --> 23:42.519
He knows you killed Janice.
I'm so sorry.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.519
Let's get in the car and go.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.680
-Get out of here. Get out of here.
-No, please.

23:52.759 --> 23:56.279
-Barry, please don't go in there.
-Get the fuck out of here.

23:56.359 --> 23:58.480
-Don't go in there.
-Get out of here.

23:59.279 --> 24:00.640
Get out of here!

24:01.160 --> 24:03.960
No, don't go in there.
Don't go in there!

24:29.960 --> 24:34.160
Johnson slippin' in, picked off!
Looking for Blocker, still on his feet.

24:34.680 --> 24:36.680
Edwards inside the 30,

24:37.799 --> 24:39.799
almost got through!

25:05.640 --> 25:08.279
Freeze!
Drop the fucking gun!

25:09.839 --> 25:11.200
Drop the gun!

25:11.559 --> 25:14.079
Berkman, drop the fucking gun!

25:15.400 --> 25:18.720
-Berkman, drop the fucking gun!
-Put it down!

25:18.799 --> 25:21.200
Drop the fucking gun or we shoot!

25:22.599 --> 25:26.279
-Put the gun down!
-Berkman, put it fucking down!

25:29.240 --> 25:30.759
Put it down!

25:31.119 --> 25:32.880
-Drop it!
-Berkman!

25:34.559 --> 25:37.000
Drop the fucking gun!

25:38.039 --> 25:39.720
Get him! Grab him!

27:07.599 --> 27:09.960
