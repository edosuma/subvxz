00:12.792 --> 00:14.375
<i>My old man, Vic Hill,</i>

00:14.458 --> 00:17.792
is of the firm belief that
people are born fully fixed.

00:17.833 --> 00:21.250
Some people are born kind,
some people are born evil,

00:21.292 --> 00:24.542
and that he was born
just plain naughty.

00:55.208 --> 00:57.125
Stay where you are!

00:57.167 --> 00:58.667
Put down your weapon!

01:14.167 --> 01:15.750
Off, now!

01:22.333 --> 01:24.042
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:24.083 --> 01:26.309
He's never known what it's
like to earn a straight living

01:26.333 --> 01:28.083
and never had any
interest in finding out.

01:28.167 --> 01:30.417
He'd rob banks, blow the
shutters off armored trucks,

01:30.500 --> 01:32.980
and have a crack at cracking any
safe that couldn't be cracked.

01:42.792 --> 01:44.750
Happy New Year, Dad.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.375
Happy New Year, Albert.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.958
Looks like I'm
in the doghouse again, son.

01:58.708 --> 02:01.000
Yeah, Mum went to sleep.

02:01.042 --> 02:02.792
I need to tell you
something, Albert,

02:02.833 --> 02:05.499
and I need you to listen
very carefully.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.018
You know when a kid at school has
got something that you really want,

02:08.042 --> 02:11.309
and you spend all your time thinking about
how to get that same thing for yourself,

02:11.333 --> 02:14.999
and you sit there, scratching your
noggin, plotting all the different ways

02:15.000 --> 02:19.666
that you can earn the money to get
that BMX that you want so badly,

02:19.667 --> 02:22.792
and you slave your
little bollocks off every day,

02:22.833 --> 02:27.000
and you just can't seem to squirrel
away enough money to get that bike.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.292
And I really wanted that bike.

02:29.333 --> 02:33.500
Yeah, well, Albert,
there is a way to get it.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.542
You just have to take it!

02:39.583 --> 02:41.333
- Take it?
- Yeah.

02:41.375 --> 02:44.667
You must not get caught.

02:44.708 --> 02:48.083
You make sure that you're super
duper smart and cover your tracks,

02:48.167 --> 02:50.500
because if you do get caught...

02:50.542 --> 02:54.500
the bubbles will go flat
in your pop.

02:59.958 --> 03:02.292
Have the bubbles gone
flat in your pop, Dad?

03:02.333 --> 03:06.167
It seems that way.

03:06.250 --> 03:11.125
Now, you... take this.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.750
It's a lucky charm.
Now, go upstairs

03:16.792 --> 03:20.958
and don't come back down
no matter what you hear.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.708
No tears, son.

03:23.750 --> 03:25.542
You're a Hill,

03:25.583 --> 03:28.542
and Hill's don't cry
over flat pop.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.708
Go.

05:22.042 --> 05:23.417
- Mornin', mate.
- Hello.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.917
You're all right? Yeah, good.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.351
- Morning, Albert.
- Hello, my love.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.458
- How are you?
- Good, love.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.667
Thank you!

05:31.708 --> 05:32.917
Morning, Albert.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.792
Hello, Eddie. It's for you.

05:41.833 --> 05:43.292
- Hello, Mum.
- Morning, Albert.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.666
- Good. Give me those.
- They're all overdue.

05:45.667 --> 05:46.976
Bills don't pay
themselves, Albert.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.417
Yeah, well, don't worry.
I'll sort it.

05:49.458 --> 05:50.958
- Charlie in?
- Since we opened.

05:59.083 --> 06:01.167
So have we gone
artisanal, Charlie boy?

06:01.208 --> 06:03.250
Brahms and List.

06:03.292 --> 06:05.292
A vanilla and cardamom infusion.

06:05.333 --> 06:08.958
Wholesaling at 400% markup
on piss-cheap Serbian vodka.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.708
And you found some tourist stupid enough
to buy all this hipster shite, have ya?

06:12.750 --> 06:14.125
Come on, Charlie,
you know we need

06:14.167 --> 06:16.059
as much cash as we can
to bet on Billy's fight tonight.

06:16.083 --> 06:19.332
Yeah, the mixologist is my second
cousin on the Cavendish Scott side.

06:19.333 --> 06:22.792
Ooh! A deal stamped in blue blood.
That imbues me with confidence.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.958
Yeah, I mean, we could always just flog
it out of the back of a van again,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.840
but that business model hasn't really
worked for us to date, has it, Al?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.499
You know, when
Billy wins tonight,

06:32.500 --> 06:35.332
we can start to leave all this
small-time shit behind us.

06:35.333 --> 06:37.434
I mean, let's face it,
this is not sustainable, is it?

06:37.458 --> 06:39.250
Head down, arms swinging out.

06:39.292 --> 06:40.917
Yeah? All right.

06:40.958 --> 06:43.059
You be a good boy and load all
that into the back of the van,

06:43.083 --> 06:44.583
and I'll see you in a few.

06:44.625 --> 06:46.625
What did your last peon die of?!

06:57.667 --> 07:00.083
All right, Albert?

07:00.167 --> 07:02.167
Morning, Patsy. I was
gonna call you today.

07:02.208 --> 07:04.088
Yeah, well, I thought
I'd save you the bother.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.167
Which way's the wind
blowing, Albert?

07:08.958 --> 07:11.792
I do need a bit more time.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.999
Come on, Patsy, I am good for it.
You know that, don't ya?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.166
Well, I'm starting
to wonder, son.

07:16.167 --> 07:20.166
You been tap-dancing around me quicker
than Fred Astaire on the nose candy.

07:20.167 --> 07:22.542
- Listen, Patsy...
- No.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.458
You listen.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.750
Don't think because you're Vic Hill's
boy, I won't come down on you.

07:27.792 --> 07:30.542
Money's owed,
and money will be paid.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.333
You got until the weekend...

07:33.375 --> 07:35.417
or I take a finger...

07:35.458 --> 07:38.000
and the florist's.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.667
I've always fancied
having me own concession.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.625
All right, mate?

07:57.667 --> 07:59.167
Keep working!

08:01.333 --> 08:02.917
Hands up, all the time!

08:02.958 --> 08:05.542
And a... Yeah! One-two, one-two!

08:05.583 --> 08:08.125
Come in behind that left!
Beauty!

08:12.167 --> 08:14.833
Would you tidy this place up, Billy?
It's a shit hole in here!

08:14.875 --> 08:17.042
Don't remember exactly
inviting you over.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.042
Right, and what are these?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.417
Thought we had an agreement.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.999
No funny business 48 hours
in the lead up to the fight.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.667
Don't worry about it, Al.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.000
I only went three rounds,
you know.

08:32.792 --> 08:34.499
What's up with you?
You know what's up with me.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.832
I told you this fight is important.
We're six unbeaten now.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.832
We win tonight, I might
be able to push things forward,

08:38.832 --> 08:40.999
make some proper money
for a change.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.625
I'm sick of scraping by
hand-to-mouth, Bill.

08:43.667 --> 08:47.042
I'm sick of living on that freezing
cold barge, you living in here.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.667
I'm sorry to break it to ya,
that's every day shit.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.137
So you gonna tell me
what's really going on?

08:57.500 --> 09:00.300
So I'm right on the back foot with
the bills, you know that, don't ya?

09:02.375 --> 09:05.735
I took out a loan against the florist to
cover 'em and now I'm late on the payments.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.750
Who'd you get the money off, Al?

09:13.333 --> 09:16.101
You went to Patsy. Well, listen, when
you're the offspring of Vic Hill

09:16.125 --> 09:17.518
you're not exactly
welcome at the bank!

09:17.542 --> 09:19.458
Well, does your mum know?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.832
She will do when he kicks her door
down, 'cause I ain't paid him back.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.792
And how much do you owe?

09:23.833 --> 09:25.832
- Twenty grand.
- Twenty grand?!

09:25.833 --> 09:28.375
- And counting, unfortunately.
- Jesus.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.934
Anyway, I'm gonna go and do a
bit of business with Charlie.

09:37.958 --> 09:39.500
I'll come grab you
before the fight.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.125
Look after yourself today!

09:41.167 --> 09:42.250
Stay hydrated.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.750
See ya in a bit.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.250
So which one of you Girl Scouts
is game for a little cuddle then?

10:08.917 --> 10:12.333
Lovely lox this, Hate 'Em All.
Where'd you source it?

10:12.375 --> 10:13.542
The Friendly Screw, Vic.

10:13.583 --> 10:16.167
Well, he is a man
one can rely on.

10:16.208 --> 10:19.458
A quality rarely seen
in our line of work these days.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.042
Used to be you knew
who you knew.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.208
Yeah, and stood where
you fucking stood.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.434
Well, you're right,
anyway, look.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.875
What you in the mood for today?

10:25.917 --> 10:29.332
Apple or pear?

10:29.333 --> 10:32.167
I think I'll go with the mix today.
Apples and pears it is then.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.000
- There you are.
- Lovely.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.040
Well, lighten yourself up,
Mrs. H is on the phone.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.250
Fifteen years in the shovel,

10:47.292 --> 10:50.000
and still yet to enjoy
a peaceful bit of breakfast.

10:50.042 --> 10:52.667
I was just telling Hate 'Em
that my greatest achievement

10:52.708 --> 10:56.458
is having you stay married to me
for all these years, Lily.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.083
You got egg
on your chin, Victor.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.167
Be at a loss without ya.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.583
Hello, Mrs. H, yeah?

11:01.625 --> 11:02.625
Hello, handsome.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.917
So, what's the gossip, Lil?

11:04.958 --> 11:07.417
Just everything shipshape
for Johnny Reid's big send-off.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.875
- We make a few quid out of it?
<i>- Hardly.</i>

11:09.917 --> 11:11.708
But all money
is good money, right, love?

11:11.750 --> 11:13.708
Good luck to him
at the pearly gates.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.351
Wonder if St. Peter will take a bung
and let him in, the vicious bastard.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.875
Is that Albert?

11:18.958 --> 11:21.000
I haven't heard from him
in a couple of weeks.

11:21.042 --> 11:22.832
<i>- He's a busy boy.</i>
- Busy with what?

11:22.833 --> 11:24.167
Flogging moonshine?

11:24.250 --> 11:26.583
Busy doing what he can
to keep us above water.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.666
It's not roses
at the minute, Vic.

11:28.667 --> 11:33.208
Albert needs to understand that this
small-time stuff is simply not sustainable.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.125
More chances to get nicked.

11:35.167 --> 11:37.542
If he's gonna play the game,
he needs to go in heavy.

11:37.583 --> 11:40.167
Come on, you were still trying
to find your feet at his age.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.375
Yeah, but I had ambition.

11:42.417 --> 11:44.434
So does Albert, he's managing
Billy's fight career.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.309
He's gotten him a decent
ticket tonight as it happens.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.500
Billy's fighting tonight?
Where's that, then?

11:48.542 --> 11:50.708
You keep your beak
out of it, Vic Hill.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.332
Any chance of a viewing, Lil?

11:52.333 --> 11:54.708
Come on, I could really do
with a good night in.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.018
No, I wasn't planning on going.

11:56.042 --> 11:57.792
I don't like seeing
Billy fighting.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.708
Ooh, you could put on
that red dress I really like,

12:00.792 --> 12:02.375
the one with the low-cut front.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.667
Show 'em all what I'm missing.

12:04.750 --> 12:06.768
Turn it. What's the matter? I'm
trying to have me breakfast.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.083
You daft sod.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.499
I'm only daft for you,
sweetheart.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.083
I'm only daft for you.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.208
Hey, Vic?

12:16.250 --> 12:20.542
Did you know that the robin redbreast is
actually five and 3/4 inches in length?

12:27.958 --> 12:30.499
El Flamingo?

12:30.500 --> 12:33.375
Did you fall off your
rocking horse, Charlie?

12:33.417 --> 12:36.332
Everyone knows this place
is fronted by Sonny Castillo.

12:36.333 --> 12:40.042
<i>And that insane, wannabe Cuban
has a zero tolerance policy</i>

12:40.125 --> 12:43.018
for any liberties of any description
being taken inside his establishment.

12:43.042 --> 12:45.458
It's urban legend, Al.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.083
Sonny Castillo is
a legitimate businessman.

13:14.542 --> 13:17.500
I'm not an accountant, Sonny,
but I can count heads,

13:17.542 --> 13:20.458
and we had a club
full last night.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.667
That was down to me.

13:22.708 --> 13:24.708
We made a deal.

13:24.792 --> 13:28.833
Ten percent of the takings,
and this is not ten percent!

13:31.458 --> 13:34.000
Always with the drama, Lotti.

13:35.292 --> 13:38.500
You need to center
your fire, baby girl.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.292
Yeah.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.750
You're right.

13:44.125 --> 13:47.208
I'll torch this place
to the ground with you in it.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.333
Hey, hey!

13:56.917 --> 13:58.667
You make me wanna salsa.

13:58.708 --> 14:00.332
I swear to God,
you got to have Cuban blood.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.625
Give me what you owe me, you
pig, or I'll leave you so fast.

14:05.292 --> 14:08.958
No one leaves Santiago Castillo.

14:10.750 --> 14:11.958
Now...

14:13.000 --> 14:14.832
You be a good girl.

14:14.833 --> 14:18.958
Go shopping, and buy
yourself something...

14:19.000 --> 14:22.375
transparent to wear tonight.

14:26.958 --> 14:28.750
Okay, baby.

14:28.792 --> 14:30.792
I'll turn some heads.

14:44.333 --> 14:49.042
And now, the distillation process
takes place in stainless steel vats

14:49.125 --> 14:51.125
for over several months.

14:51.167 --> 14:54.292
The, timing
of the distillation is as such...

14:54.333 --> 14:56.999
Oi, what is it with you boys
and your bullshit?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.958
Just pour the shit.

15:00.042 --> 15:03.143
Where's Charlie's cousin? Just always
expected to be dealing with him directly.

15:03.167 --> 15:06.917
He got caught with his dirty, thieving
fingers in the till last night.

15:06.958 --> 15:11.042
Lil' Manny here had a chin-wag with
him, threw him out with the empties.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.375
Well, you know, he was always
the black sheep of the family.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.417
Pour.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.875
You got a good pour.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.833
That smells like shit.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.333
Give me that, Beanie.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.083
Cardamom vanilla.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.083
You've got some bollocks.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.875
Yeah, well, if it's
not to your liking,

15:44.917 --> 15:49.208
we can be on our way, can't we?
Not to my liking? It's inspired.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.958
Inspired?

15:51.000 --> 15:52.292
Well, that's good, right?

15:52.333 --> 15:53.583
How many cases do you have?

15:53.625 --> 15:55.083
Dozen out in the van.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.875
We'll take the lot.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.208
Pay these boys.

16:05.042 --> 16:06.333
Cash works, fellas.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.166
Well, that went
to plan, didn't it?

16:10.167 --> 16:12.333
"Went to plan," you penis?

16:12.375 --> 16:15.583
We were seconds away from getting
the carpet treatment in there.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.393
I just made us two grand. When are
you gonna give me a pat on the back?

16:18.417 --> 16:20.666
When you start adding some
risk-averse value to this operation.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.332
"Risk-averse value"?

16:22.333 --> 16:24.809
I think you might want to reconsider
our chosen line of work, Al.

16:24.833 --> 16:27.375
You know it was never
a choice for me.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.684
Yeah, and I was born with
a silver spoon up my ass, right?

16:29.708 --> 16:32.125
- I didn't say that, Charlie.
- Didn't have to.

16:32.167 --> 16:34.208
I know what you and Billy think.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.500
"Charlie, he's not the offspring of a
bank robber or a bare-knuckle fighter.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.726
No, he couldn't possibly know his
way around "a bit of business."

16:39.750 --> 16:41.750
I don't have time for this now!

16:41.833 --> 16:44.893
We have to concentrate on finding more folding
to put down on Billy's fight tonight!

16:44.917 --> 16:47.667
This ain't gonna cut it, and you
know that mental case, Patsy

16:47.708 --> 16:50.667
is gonna be sharpening his garden
scissors and dreaming of daffodils.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.832
Where you going? Charlie?

16:53.833 --> 16:55.333
Charlie, where you going?

16:55.375 --> 16:57.792
To dip my fingers
in the family coffers,

16:57.833 --> 17:00.417
so you can remain
in possession of all of yours.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.500
You're Albert Hill.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.041
Vic Hill's son, right?

17:07.833 --> 17:10.125
That's right.

17:10.166 --> 17:13.916
Thought you'd have more about you
than flogging rebottled piss water.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.333
But then again...

17:16.375 --> 17:18.518
maybe you're just like all the
other losers in this neighborhood.

17:18.541 --> 17:20.018
And you're fulfilling
your dreams, are you?

17:20.041 --> 17:23.332
Knocking about
with Sonny Castillo?

17:23.333 --> 17:25.708
I haven't even started
to live my dreams, yet, mate.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.166
All right, nobody move a muscle.

17:39.167 --> 17:40.917
Vic, we got three bars here.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.393
Don't do drugs, Albert,
you'll end up in prison.

17:57.417 --> 17:59.208
Drugs are really expensive
in prison.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.434
- Well, I'll bear that in mind, Dad.
<i>- Listen, I've had a think.</i>

18:01.458 --> 18:03.499
Gonna work the odds
on Billy Boy's fight tonight.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.851
- How'd you know about Billy's fight?
<i>- Have him smack the fella</i>

18:05.875 --> 18:07.726
around for three rounds
without putting him away.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.332
The odds are gonna shorten on the
win, so we go in heavy on a loss.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.500
Have Billy catch a cold
in the fourth. Boom.

18:12.542 --> 18:14.542
No, I'm not having
Billy take a fall. No way!

18:14.625 --> 18:16.018
I'm trying to build
something here, Dad.

18:16.042 --> 18:19.208
Okay. I appreciate that...
but it's page one.

18:19.292 --> 18:22.226
When the odds are there to be worked, we
work 'em. Gonna make a packet out of this.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.101
Get back to your winning ways
the next go around.

18:24.125 --> 18:27.083
I've got ten grand stashed with
Clive at the battle cruiser.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.750
Go and grab it,
and put it on the wager.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.809
And since when did you have
ten grand stashed at the pub?

18:30.833 --> 18:32.500
Rainy day readies.

18:32.542 --> 18:33.708
You forget I'm a bank robber?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.208
Get your head straight, son.

18:39.250 --> 18:40.625
Billy goes down in the fourth.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.208
Bollocks!

18:50.708 --> 18:52.708
Dad just called me.

18:52.750 --> 18:55.625
- Did he now?
- Knows about the fight.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.167
Wants Billy to take a fall.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.042
Told me we'd "make
a packet out of it."

19:00.125 --> 19:02.167
- And what did you say?
- What do you think I said?

19:02.250 --> 19:05.226
He didn't give me a chance to say anything,
did he? You know what he gets like.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.583
Your dad sees things
in simple terms, love.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.875
If there's a bulletproof way to turn
over a pound, he'll take it every time.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.237
Well, that equaled out perfectly
for all of us, didn't it?

19:14.833 --> 19:16.458
Don't be too tough on him, love.

19:16.500 --> 19:20.875
I mean, he's just... trying to
stay relevant. "Stay relevant?"

19:20.917 --> 19:22.934
What about me? I'm just trying
to get fucking relevant.

19:22.958 --> 19:24.583
- Language, Albert.
- No, Mum!

19:24.625 --> 19:26.518
We've been up against it
ever since Dad got nicked.

19:26.542 --> 19:29.832
Unpaid bills up to our ears! We
haven't had any help from anyone!

19:29.833 --> 19:33.499
You're still peddling fake designer shirts,
and look at me, I'm still wearing 'em.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.101
Dad put us in this situation in the
first place, and he thinks he can just

19:36.125 --> 19:38.518
call me up and get me to do whatever
he wants whenever he wants.

19:38.542 --> 19:41.542
Was that a statement
or a question, Albert?

19:41.625 --> 19:43.958
'Cause what I see
is a young man,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.458
and he should be making
his own choices.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.833
Yeah.

20:06.708 --> 20:10.917
Hello, Staff.! Good
afternoon, Master Charles.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.750
Are my parents home?

20:12.833 --> 20:16.708
Well, if you mean "parents"
in the biological context,

20:16.750 --> 20:19.999
pertaining to an organism, cell,
or complex molecular structure

20:20.000 --> 20:22.999
that generates
or produces another, then yes,

20:23.000 --> 20:28.417
your "parents" are indeed...
in residence.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.292
Thank you, Staff.

20:35.208 --> 20:36.708
Afternoon, Charlie.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.792
Everything ticking along
all right, old chap?

20:46.833 --> 20:48.667
Head down,
arms swinging, Father.

20:48.708 --> 20:51.083
Good boy.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.101
Do me a favor, would you,
and pop into the bedroom

21:02.125 --> 21:04.292
and remind your mother
that the plumber was called out

21:04.333 --> 21:07.999
to disencumber...
the pipes and not her.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.417
Okay.

21:10.458 --> 21:12.625
TMI. Jesus.

21:22.292 --> 21:23.917
Christ.

21:46.542 --> 21:47.809
Work the odds
a little bit, Alby.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.499
We'll make a packet
out of it, Alby.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.250
Course Billy
goes down in the fourth,

21:51.292 --> 21:53.434
'cause you have to run my life
from inside the nick, don't ya?

21:53.458 --> 21:55.309
He ain't going down. Why does
he go down in the fourth?

21:55.333 --> 21:57.351
He ain't gonna take a dive, you
ain't gonna shorten the odds,

21:57.375 --> 21:58.708
he ain't going down
in the fourth.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.958
Not going down in the...

22:03.833 --> 22:04.917
All right, Albert?

22:04.958 --> 22:06.458
Vic called, said
you'd be dropping by.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.220
And like a rabbit
out of a hat, here I am.

22:10.792 --> 22:13.167
Any thoughts on the fight, son?

22:16.208 --> 22:17.833
Too close to call, Clive.

22:33.417 --> 22:34.958
Good afternoon.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.417
And how may I be of assistance?

22:37.458 --> 22:40.750
Um, S-Saul Gold, please.

22:40.792 --> 22:44.000
Mr. Gold is occupied,
but I'd be more than happy

22:44.042 --> 22:45.958
to help you with any
inquiry you may have.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.542
Inquiry, yeah, I may have...

22:49.875 --> 22:52.875
Right, , yeah, um...

22:52.917 --> 22:54.125
yeah.

22:54.167 --> 22:59.875
Um, I have a very rare,
gold, antique fob watch.

22:59.917 --> 23:02.333
Mint condition.

23:02.375 --> 23:05.708
Been in my family,
the Cavendish-Scotts,

23:05.792 --> 23:08.666
for over four generations.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.167
Um, I'd like an appraisal
for a potential sale.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.958
It's sub-mint, as indicated
here by the wear on the bezel.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.083
The weight of the watch is 100
grams, so mass value is nominal.

23:22.667 --> 23:27.292
Not antique, but placed into
the mid-century modern era.

23:27.333 --> 23:31.500
The fob watch is not a style that
is in vogue in the current market.

23:31.542 --> 23:36.125
So, we could make you a purchase
price offer of 3,000 pounds.

23:39.333 --> 23:44.083
Would that be satisfactory, sir?

23:44.167 --> 23:48.667
Yeah, what? How-how much? Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that-that-that-that's satisfactory.

23:53.542 --> 23:55.833
Pleasure doing business with you, Mr.
Cavendish-Scott.

24:02.917 --> 24:05.333
Go in. Ask her out.

24:05.375 --> 24:08.250
Or call her later? Now? Later?

24:08.292 --> 24:09.708
Too soon?

24:10.792 --> 24:12.333
Too soon.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.000
Billy, I wanna run
something past ya.

24:31.875 --> 24:35.625
It's about the fight.
And what about it?

24:35.667 --> 24:39.250
Well, I've been thinking... you know
if we work the odds on this a bit,

24:39.292 --> 24:41.772
well, you know, we can make a
packet out of it. Work the odds?

24:42.667 --> 24:44.500
I ain't taking a dive, Al.

24:44.542 --> 24:46.167
- Not a chance.
- Listen, Billy.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.625
You know I'd never
ask you to do that.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.125
So what're you asking then?

24:56.625 --> 24:59.833
Take a few slaps
in the first three rounds.

24:59.875 --> 25:01.684
Right, we let the odds lengthen
on you winning,

25:01.708 --> 25:04.332
we lay down our bet, and you poleaxe
this prick in the fourth round.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.832
You want me to do
the rope-a-dope?

25:06.833 --> 25:09.913
I know it's a lot to ask of ya, but I'm
right on the back foot here, ain't I?

25:12.458 --> 25:15.125
I do this...
and our problem goes away?

25:15.167 --> 25:16.458
Like it never happened.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.833
- All right, then.
- Yeah?

25:21.917 --> 25:24.000
What, seriously?!

25:24.083 --> 25:26.792
Well, you know I've never been
shy about taking a few digs, Al.

25:26.833 --> 25:28.667
- Come here.
- Oi, easy there!

25:28.708 --> 25:30.500
Feint! Protect
yourself at all times.

25:30.542 --> 25:31.833
You're lucky!

25:34.083 --> 25:35.458
And what?

25:45.250 --> 25:46.875
Albert Hill!

25:46.917 --> 25:49.667
What's occurring, Blud? This and
that, Tip Top, you know me.

25:49.708 --> 25:53.792
So, is your half-Pikey pal
ready for a proper tear up?

25:53.833 --> 25:55.167
What do you think?

26:02.833 --> 26:06.292
Fighter weighs in at 162 pounds.

26:15.333 --> 26:17.500
You promised us
a "proper ding dong" Tip Top.

26:17.542 --> 26:20.042
We're fighting Castillo's boy.

26:20.083 --> 26:22.723
Keep your head straight, Billy, all right?
Keep your head straight.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.750
I'm comin' for you!

26:43.792 --> 26:45.083
It's fight night!

26:55.833 --> 26:57.083
Come on, Al.

26:57.125 --> 26:58.750
You've wrapped me
three times already.

26:58.792 --> 27:01.073
Yeah, well, these babies
are our ticket to the big time.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.500
- All right, girls?
- There he is.

27:04.542 --> 27:07.417
Where've you been? Getting
your bottom spanked by Staff?

27:07.500 --> 27:10.999
No, raising funds to extract
your broke ass from the gutter.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.625
- Yeah, all right.
- A "little risk-averse value."

27:14.667 --> 27:17.332
Three bags to up the ante.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.792
Three grand? Shit.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.833
Fair play, Charlie Boy.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.832
Fifteen grand, all right?

27:28.833 --> 27:31.667
All of it to go down
on Billy to win in the fourth.

27:31.708 --> 27:34.458
And don't put it down till the
end of round three, we good?

27:34.500 --> 27:35.625
Good as gold.

27:42.583 --> 27:43.958
Oi.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.833
Round four.

27:45.875 --> 27:47.542
- Fourth round.
- Right.

27:50.333 --> 27:51.583
- Hate 'Em?
- Yeah?

27:51.667 --> 27:53.167
- Fight time.
- Fine.

27:53.208 --> 27:54.833
I'll be back for you,
little man.

27:54.875 --> 27:57.309
Keep them custard creams on ice
for me, all right? Yeah, right.

27:57.333 --> 27:59.253
All right, let's get
the old lady on the phone.

28:00.667 --> 28:02.375
Hey.

28:08.500 --> 28:09.667
Sit right here, baby.

28:10.750 --> 28:13.000
- All right, love?
- Hello, beautiful.

28:13.042 --> 28:14.667
You get us some ringside seats?

28:14.708 --> 28:17.750
Well, the Hill name still holds
some sway around here, babe.

28:17.792 --> 28:19.333
Check this out.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.250
Come on!
You're the man! You got this!

28:31.333 --> 28:32.500
Billy Boy!

28:45.792 --> 28:47.792
Okay, let's have some fun!

28:52.583 --> 28:54.167
Center of the ring,
please, boys.

28:58.458 --> 29:00.500
Right. I want a good,
clean fight.

29:00.542 --> 29:02.417
Leave the monkey business
in the zoo.

29:02.458 --> 29:05.458
To your corners.
To your corners!

29:08.792 --> 29:10.101
Boys, can you keep
the noise down?

29:10.125 --> 29:12.042
The fight's about
to start. Sweet.

29:14.042 --> 29:16.282
Listen to me, stick to the
plan, and we're home and dry.

29:16.333 --> 29:17.393
Stick to the plan, all right?

29:17.417 --> 29:19.292
No knockout until
the fourth, yeah?

29:19.333 --> 29:21.500
Right, that's
when he's getting it.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.332
I hope he remembers to go down.

29:23.333 --> 29:24.708
He'll go down.

29:35.125 --> 29:36.417
Go, Billy!

29:37.542 --> 29:38.708
Come on!

29:45.708 --> 29:48.375
Come on, Chepe!

29:48.417 --> 29:50.750
- Referee, he's holding now!
- He's holding!

29:54.667 --> 29:55.708
Referee!

30:04.125 --> 30:05.167
Slow down, Billy Boy.

30:19.458 --> 30:21.000
Have a live wire
in that boy, innit?

30:21.042 --> 30:23.708
Yeah, Billy Boy, you know the script.
You know the script.

30:24.708 --> 30:26.875
Ref! Wake up!

30:29.708 --> 30:31.708
What are you doing in there?!

30:31.750 --> 30:34.083
- I barely touched him.
- Well, touch him less.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.750
Less touching, please.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.333
Touch him, touch him!

31:05.792 --> 31:08.672
- Too early, too early.
- I know, but he's makin' it look good, isn't he?

31:29.375 --> 31:31.167
Nice! Come on!

31:39.667 --> 31:40.792
- No.
- No.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.433
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31:44.667 --> 31:45.667
Come on, Billy!

31:49.208 --> 31:50.417
Oi!

32:00.917 --> 32:03.166
After the bell, that.

32:03.167 --> 32:06.487
- Round four, we're done, we're done. We're home dry.
- Sweet, this is it, we're in.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.167
How you feeling?

32:13.208 --> 32:15.667
- Good as gold, Al.
- Yeah?

32:15.750 --> 32:18.125
What action you offering
Billy Ayers in the fourth?

32:18.167 --> 32:20.417
It's a carpet.
Three to one odds.

32:20.458 --> 32:23.750
- Fifteen large.
- Fifteen large?

32:23.792 --> 32:25.542
Do I stutter?

32:25.583 --> 32:28.223
Well, I'll have to go up the totem
pole to get an aye on this one.

32:38.625 --> 32:40.917
I will take your folding,
big bollocks.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.667
- Lovely.
- Nice one.

32:47.667 --> 32:50.499
Fourth round, Bill.
Fourth round, Bill?

32:50.500 --> 32:52.458
Put him on his ass.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.875
- Come on, Billy, you know what to do.
- You got this, Bill.

33:03.500 --> 33:04.792
- Billy!
- No!

33:07.542 --> 33:08.833
No!

33:08.875 --> 33:09.833
What is he doing?!

33:09.875 --> 33:12.042
Billy! Billy! Come on then!

33:13.375 --> 33:14.583
- One.
- Get up.

33:14.625 --> 33:16.042
Two.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.375
Three.

33:18.417 --> 33:20.917
Four.
I need you to get up, Chepe.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.375
Come on, come on!

33:23.417 --> 33:25.250
- Six.
- Are you counting down or what?

33:25.333 --> 33:27.013
- Seven.
- Are you counting there or what?!

33:30.208 --> 33:32.292
Nine.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.333
Move it.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.833
Box!

33:36.875 --> 33:38.125
Shit!

33:42.333 --> 33:44.499
Ref! He's gouging his eye there!

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
- He gouged his eye!
- He thumbed his eye!

33:47.625 --> 33:49.000
Sit your ass down.

33:54.958 --> 33:56.542
Ho, ho, ho!

33:56.583 --> 33:57.667
Yeah!

33:59.833 --> 34:01.250
- Boom!
- There he is!

34:10.000 --> 34:11.500
- Bye-bye, good night.
- Stay down.

34:13.833 --> 34:17.167
One, two, three, four...

34:17.208 --> 34:19.166
- Billy, stand up!
- Five!

34:19.167 --> 34:23.666
Six.

34:23.667 --> 34:25.625
Seven.

34:25.667 --> 34:27.667
Bill! Get your ass up!

34:27.708 --> 34:29.750
- Eight!
- Eight!

34:32.833 --> 34:35.750
Nine!

34:35.792 --> 34:37.375
No.

34:43.208 --> 34:46.500
Chepe Vago is the winner by TKO!

34:46.542 --> 34:49.000
Son!

35:05.417 --> 35:07.833
Oi! Hey, what's your game now?

35:07.917 --> 35:09.292
Ten seconds, can you count?

35:09.333 --> 35:10.976
Waving off after nine,
what's your problem?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.417
- That's it mate, that's it.
- You're a mug, you're a mug!

35:23.333 --> 35:25.167
Whoo! Whoo!

35:34.333 --> 35:36.500
Let's get out of here.

35:36.542 --> 35:39.708
I mean, he turned us over!
Castillo properly turned us over!

35:39.792 --> 35:41.500
All that money, Billy, gone.

35:46.833 --> 35:48.833
Shit!

35:48.917 --> 35:50.809
We're fucked! Yeah, and not
to mention the small issue

35:50.833 --> 35:52.833
that Vic Hill thinks
he just won a small fortune.

35:52.875 --> 35:55.268
I'm well aware that I'm now 30
grand in the hole to my old man.

35:55.292 --> 35:58.708
Thank you very much, Charlie. Yeah, well, I
say we go back there and lodge a protest.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.083
Let's go back and kick
the shit out of him.

36:02.250 --> 36:03.250
Hey!

36:15.667 --> 36:17.542
All right, boys?

36:21.208 --> 36:23.333
What do you want?

36:23.375 --> 36:25.333
Sonny hustled you guys.

36:25.417 --> 36:29.083
- I think you mean your boyfriend hustled us.
- Soon to be ex-boyfriend.

36:29.125 --> 36:30.792
Time to move along.

36:30.833 --> 36:32.666
Your eye all right, tough guy?

36:32.667 --> 36:35.000
Still in its socket.

36:35.042 --> 36:36.583
You haven't answered
my question.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.250
It was me who turned
El Flamingo from a dive bar

36:39.292 --> 36:40.875
into the hottest
spot around here.

36:42.708 --> 36:45.792
Sonny's been shortchanging me
out of my cut for months.

36:45.833 --> 36:47.750
I want what's mine.

36:47.792 --> 36:50.542
My guess is you want
what's yours.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.917
Thought we could help each other.
Go on.

36:54.708 --> 36:57.042
Sonny's got a collection
going out this morning.

36:57.083 --> 37:02.332
5:00 a.m. A security van picks up this
month's takings from El Flamingo.

37:02.333 --> 37:07.332
I'm talking couple
of hundred grand?

37:07.333 --> 37:11.166
I give you the route, you figure out
the best place to hit the truck.

37:11.167 --> 37:12.999
"Hit the truck"?

37:13.000 --> 37:16.250
And what makes you think we'd be
stupid enough to rob Sonny Castillo?

37:16.292 --> 37:19.625
Maybe the rumors
about you are right.

37:19.667 --> 37:22.083
The apple did fall
far from the tree.

37:23.417 --> 37:25.333
But if you boys
decide to man up...

37:27.708 --> 37:29.417
I'm only 11 digits away.

37:42.667 --> 37:45.332
We've gotta go after him, Al.

37:45.333 --> 37:49.458
I can't just sit on my hands. For once,
I think I actually agree with Billy.

37:49.500 --> 37:52.332
And you think you've got the minerals to
hold up a security van, do you, Charlie?

37:52.333 --> 37:54.125
Actually, yeah, I think I might.

37:54.167 --> 37:56.476
Yeah, well, Sonny Castillo is a
proper nut, and if we get this wrong?

37:56.500 --> 37:59.518
We are bang in trouble, and I'm talkin' "two
in the back of the head" kind of trouble.

37:59.542 --> 38:00.833
What do you think Vic'd do?

38:00.875 --> 38:02.375
We all know what Vic would do!

38:02.417 --> 38:04.917
This entire neighborhood
knows what Vic Hill would do!

38:08.000 --> 38:11.200
Now, you wanna go and do a 20 stretch in
the nick, you go and knock yourself out.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.500
Get inside, boys, come on.

38:23.958 --> 38:26.958
There's no shame
in what happened tonight, Billy.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.208
You had him beat,
and you were robbed.

38:29.292 --> 38:31.333
Bloody robbed.

38:33.167 --> 38:36.125
I'm, sorry about
the towels, Mrs. H.

38:36.167 --> 38:38.792
Don't you worry, love.
You know it's not the first time

38:38.833 --> 38:43.083
I've had to clear up a mess in this house.
Most likely won't be the last.

38:45.167 --> 38:46.792
Albert?

38:46.833 --> 38:48.125
Kitchen.

38:51.583 --> 38:53.625
So I take it you bet on the win.

38:53.667 --> 38:55.976
Yeah, and we would have won
if we hadn't been turned over.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.042
Somebody's always getting turned
over in this game, Albert,

38:59.083 --> 39:00.500
you should know that by now.

39:02.833 --> 39:05.666
Well, I feel like
I'm losing control, right?

39:05.667 --> 39:08.018
Paddlin' upstream, trying to steer
things in the right direction,

39:08.042 --> 39:10.333
and as soon as I feel
like I'm gettin' somewhere...

39:11.458 --> 39:12.833
Everything turns to shit.

39:14.083 --> 39:15.167
Yeah.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.708
Why is it so hard to get ahead?

39:19.750 --> 39:20.875
Why?

39:25.667 --> 39:26.958
Listen.

39:28.708 --> 39:32.208
I know life has dealt you
a tough hand,

39:32.250 --> 39:34.958
but it is what it is,

39:35.000 --> 39:37.042
and we are where we are,

39:37.083 --> 39:40.417
and the only part of it
you can control

39:40.500 --> 39:43.332
is how you react to the
crap that is thrown at you.

39:43.333 --> 39:45.832
So, you can either be a mark,

39:45.833 --> 39:47.833
or make a mark, Albert.

39:49.333 --> 39:52.125
No one can make
that choice for you.

39:54.833 --> 39:56.667
I'm gonna turn in.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.417
Get up, boys.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.750
We're gonna hit that truck.

41:12.375 --> 41:13.625
Two trucks?!

41:16.292 --> 41:17.583
Think, think!

41:25.125 --> 41:26.542
Shit!

41:34.292 --> 41:36.583
Right. Let's be having ya!

41:37.792 --> 41:39.708
No, you bloody well don't!

42:17.125 --> 42:18.125
What's that?

42:20.250 --> 42:21.500
We've rung the bell.

42:30.042 --> 42:33.042
Charlie... can you bring
the van 'round, please, mate?

42:36.542 --> 42:38.625
That's gangsta!
