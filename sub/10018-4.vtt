WEBVTT

00:06.921 --> 00:08.499
Previously on E.R.

00:08.534 --> 00:10.914
Hulda, that's Mark. Mark, that's Hulda.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.318
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:12.319 --> 00:14.745
Peter, I'm not ready to walk out
on my marriage.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.363
Hi, I'm Randi. I'm the new clerk.

00:17.364 --> 00:20.003
- Get her off my back.
- Her?

00:20.004 --> 00:20.804
- Weaver.

00:20.805 --> 00:25.105
She's really quite competent,
but her attitude is openly hostile.

00:25.106 --> 00:26.843
It's probably a communication thing.

00:28.145 --> 00:29.849
- I'm gonna get Benton.
- No, he's my patient.

00:29.850 --> 00:30.568
We should go out.

00:30.569 --> 00:31.569
- Really?
- Definitely.

00:31.944 --> 00:34.647
- You're not abandoning this baby!
- I'll be back.

00:34.682 --> 00:36.500
I'm dying inside, Susie.

00:38.681 --> 00:40.860
"What Life?"

00:42.534 --> 00:46.069
Mark? Mark, are you asleep?

00:51.626 --> 00:55.244
Wake up, sleepy one. It's your wife.

00:55.421 --> 00:56.796
What?

00:56.964 --> 00:59.454
- Where?
- On the phone.

00:59.632 --> 01:02.206
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

01:13.894 --> 01:16.431
Hello? Jen?

01:17.021 --> 01:18.432
Jen?

01:19.149 --> 01:21.473
- Did I hang up?
- Daddy?

01:21.650 --> 01:24.983
Hi, Rachel. Hi, honey.
Is Mommy calling me?

01:27.238 --> 01:30.441
- Doug already gone?
- Still sleeping.

01:31.491 --> 01:34.860
Of course it's me.
What do you mean I sound funny?

01:35.036 --> 01:37.243
- Can I talk to Mommy?
- How does this look?

01:39.040 --> 01:40.450
My ankle.

01:40.666 --> 01:44.034
Well, can she talk while
she gets your Froot Loops?

01:44.210 --> 01:48.670
The ankle looks healed.

01:52.051 --> 01:56.547
Listen, Rachel, is Mommy...?
She seem a little mad?

01:56.722 --> 02:00.340
Jen! Hi! You're up early.

02:00.516 --> 02:02.592
Wow, what a nice surprise.

02:02.768 --> 02:04.345
Yeah.

02:12.526 --> 02:18.065
Oh, yeah. We're on a roll now.
Aren't we, Susie? Yes!

02:18.239 --> 02:19.733
Okay.

02:22.951 --> 02:24.410
Yeah.

02:24.578 --> 02:28.160
Yes, yes, yes. Here we go.
Here we go.

02:28.749 --> 02:32.615
Oh, boy. Good timing.

02:32.793 --> 02:35.544
Okay. Diapers.

02:43.927 --> 02:48.056
That's why God created
convenience stores, huh? Yeah.

02:48.681 --> 02:52.215
Yeah, it'll be okay, Susie.
I promise. Okay?

02:52.434 --> 02:54.973
I don't want a loaner.
I want my own damn car!

02:55.146 --> 02:58.181
That's why Walter told you
to replace that starter.

02:58.357 --> 02:59.851
Careful of those surgeon hands.

03:00.025 --> 03:03.856
- Jackie, I can't be late today.
- Oh, doing a big brain transplant?

03:04.028 --> 03:08.073
It's my first gastroplasty,
and my whole day is backing up.

03:08.241 --> 03:11.858
Mine too, okay? I was counting on you
to take me to work.

03:12.035 --> 03:15.368
- Let Peanut take the car...
- He doesn't touch it. Where's Walter?

03:15.538 --> 03:20.532
- How long does a test drive take?
- It's a Porsche. He'll be a while.

03:21.584 --> 03:25.203
And don't blame your bad mood
on Walter. He tried to warn you.

03:25.380 --> 03:26.707
About what?

03:27.880 --> 03:29.624
Messing with a married woman.

03:33.218 --> 03:35.378
Where's the loaner?

03:40.642 --> 03:44.141
Yeah. Oh, how can you sleep?

03:44.437 --> 03:46.761
How can you sleep?

03:53.735 --> 03:55.728
No. No, thanks.

03:55.947 --> 03:57.321
Doc?

03:59.909 --> 04:02.658
You're my doc! Come on, you...

04:02.827 --> 04:06.776
You really saved my life.
You fixed my feet. Remember?

04:06.956 --> 04:09.873
- Oh! Right.
- Listen, you used some Demerol.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.866
- You used Demerol. Do you...?
- I don't have any right now, so...

04:14.044 --> 04:17.495
Well, listen. I'm gonna stop by
and see you again. Okay?

04:17.672 --> 04:20.209
- I'm sure you will. Take care.
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.

04:20.382 --> 04:22.007
All right. Thanks.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.922
Hey! Hey!

04:29.808 --> 04:34.433
- You forgot these.
- Oh, my God! Thanks. I'm in a rush.

04:36.897 --> 04:40.063
- Is this a little boy or a little girl?
- Don't! Don't!

04:40.234 --> 04:42.559
She's afraid of strangers.

04:42.736 --> 04:44.230
Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:44.404 --> 04:47.274
We're late. Thank you.

04:51.826 --> 04:54.115
Carter, come on.
I've got gridlock already.

04:54.287 --> 04:56.493
- Where is Dr. Benton?
- Three more night floats.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.201
Can't we admit them now
and Benton can sign off later?

04:59.374 --> 05:02.624
It's not up to me. Ask Hal.

05:02.919 --> 05:05.042
Surgical cosign incomplete.

05:05.212 --> 05:09.126
- Carter, what about this gangrenous toe?
- Waiting on Dr. Benton.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.501
Carol? Bet you're glad to hear
my voice. Can you come in today?

05:12.677 --> 05:15.250
It's not a dress code, it's a suggestion.

05:15.429 --> 05:18.134
Your appearance should
make patients feel comfortable.

05:18.307 --> 05:21.343
What number of earrings do you think
wouldn't upset my patients?

05:21.519 --> 05:24.352
Two would be my recommendation.
One in each ear.

05:24.561 --> 05:26.934
So I shouldn't count the one
in my navel?

05:27.106 --> 05:29.430
Or anywhere else.

05:29.607 --> 05:32.229
What is this? Patients in the hall?

05:32.402 --> 05:35.688
Diverticulitis, rule-out appy, lap choly.

05:35.905 --> 05:39.403
- All waiting to be admitted.
- They can't wait here. Where's Benton?

05:39.616 --> 05:42.700
- He's...
- Dr. Hicks? Could you help Mr. Carter?

05:42.868 --> 05:47.578
- Not right now. Where's Dr. Benton?
- On his way. On his way.

06:16.481 --> 06:18.721
- This section is for surgeons.
- Oh, yeah?

06:18.899 --> 06:21.853
- You need a surgical sticker here.
- And where's yours?

06:22.028 --> 06:25.395
It's a loaner. Look, move.
I don't have time to call Security.

06:25.612 --> 06:29.111
- Look, find your own spot.
- You can't park here.

06:29.365 --> 06:32.284
Well, I am parked here.

06:32.452 --> 06:35.820
So what are you gonna
do about it, doctor?

06:49.674 --> 06:51.916
Shit! Damn!

07:50.554 --> 07:55.842
Oh, my God. I am so late.
Slow morning, huh? Thank goodness.

07:56.015 --> 07:59.963
Susie! You look 100% cotton today.

08:00.184 --> 08:02.425
Who makes this?

08:02.602 --> 08:05.092
- I'm gonna run her upstairs real fast.
- Okay.

08:05.270 --> 08:07.096
- I'll be back in five.
- Okay.

08:07.271 --> 08:09.393
- Where is everyone?
- Outside.

08:09.564 --> 08:11.142
Some rush-hour traffic thing.

08:17.027 --> 08:18.734
- Go on. I got her.
- Thanks.

08:19.778 --> 08:22.103
Collision. Chest to steering wheel.
Head to dash.

08:22.280 --> 08:24.817
GCS, 10. BP, 90/50. Pulse, 120.

08:24.990 --> 08:27.822
Facial lacs, splinted at left tib-fib.
Right ankle's funky.

08:27.991 --> 08:31.191
- Any more coming in?
- Child passenger. Ross has it.

08:31.367 --> 08:34.984
Careful with this line. I had to stick
her 10 times to get it.

08:38.203 --> 08:40.409
Where did they take my mom?

08:40.580 --> 08:43.330
Doctors are taking care of mom, okay?
How are you?

08:43.499 --> 08:46.333
The only injury's a bruise on his hip.
Kid wore a seat belt.

08:46.500 --> 08:51.042
We could use one right now.
I'll check if he's as strong as he acts.

08:53.212 --> 08:55.204
We got another one.

08:59.716 --> 09:05.135
- I'll pick you up, I guess, at 8:00?
- Okay.

09:05.343 --> 09:07.632
Yeah? All right.

09:09.513 --> 09:12.678
So dinner last night went okay.

09:14.849 --> 09:17.766
Let's get a CBC,
type and cross six units.

09:17.934 --> 09:20.056
IV's infiltrated. I'll start a central line.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.475
Good morning, Susan.
We were starting to worry. I'll do the IJ.

09:23.645 --> 09:26.314
Get X-ray in here.
Cross-table C-spine,

09:26.315 --> 09:28.983
chest, pelvis, lower extremities.

09:29.147 --> 09:33.014
- And see what Dr. Greene needs.
- Pulse, 120. Resps, 28.

09:33.193 --> 09:37.022
Check the board, Susan. I think you're
assigned to the bounced-back bellyache.

09:38.446 --> 09:40.899
Increase oxygen, 15 liters.

09:45.699 --> 09:48.782
There. That is a much better
look for you.

09:48.951 --> 09:52.034
- Dr. Weaver hasn't seen you yet today?
- No. Why?

09:52.203 --> 09:53.779
I just wanna be there.

09:54.663 --> 09:57.745
- I thought you finished your ride-alongs?
- I did.

10:00.499 --> 10:04.032
We were just going shopping. Shep
has to cook for the station tomorrow.

10:04.209 --> 10:07.327
- Shep? His name is Shep?
- You say the man cooks too?

10:07.502 --> 10:10.287
- Elvis had a dog named Shep.
- They all cook.

10:10.462 --> 10:13.793
- Those dual-function gentlemen.
- Hard to resist.

10:19.717 --> 10:24.043
- A little more curl to the lip. Yeah.
- Please don't encourage him.

10:24.219 --> 10:27.219
I need a GI cocktail for Mr. Perry
in Curtain 3.

10:29.181 --> 10:32.879
Can you give me another minute,
and then I'll get her up to daycare?

10:33.057 --> 10:34.682
Sure. We're having a ball.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.474
How did it go with the attorney?

10:36.643 --> 10:39.595
I have to wait three months
before I can claim abandonment.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.638
Well, maybe Chloe will have
second thoughts.

10:42.812 --> 10:46.393
She left her own baby.
She's not entitled to second thoughts.

10:47.983 --> 10:49.988
Mr. Perry, I ordered medications.

10:49.989 --> 10:52.394
If your pain is gastrointestinal,
you'll get relief.

10:52.569 --> 10:56.433
- The man had a heart attack.
- Frieda, stop. It's heartburn.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.944
Given your husband's diet last night,
gastritis seems likely.

11:00.114 --> 11:04.406
He gets three-alarm chili over spicy fries
all the time, never bothered him before.

11:04.575 --> 11:06.898
It could've been a Burrito Grande
during Leno.

11:07.076 --> 11:10.158
She's a little freaked.
My old man had a coronary.

11:10.911 --> 11:12.572
You'll need to lay off these.

11:13.288 --> 11:18.363
Your pain could be cardiac-related
but we'll run some tests to rule that out.

11:20.833 --> 11:24.165
- How long will that take?
- A few hours. Have to be somewhere?

11:24.377 --> 11:27.495
No, I was just wondering
when you serve lunch around here.

11:35.342 --> 11:37.378
- Hi!
- Hey, hi!

11:37.550 --> 11:40.254
- I had fun last night.
- Told you you'd like the mosh pit.

11:40.427 --> 11:42.668
- Are we still on for tonight?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:42.845 --> 11:45.086
Let's do something less crowded,
like food.

11:45.263 --> 11:46.721
- Food's good.
- Okay.

11:46.888 --> 11:48.431
Carter?

11:48.599 --> 11:52.724
Weaver nixed your MRI on the John Doe
with a possible hand fracture.

11:52.892 --> 11:55.512
I hate to agree with management,
but she's got a point.

11:55.686 --> 11:58.436
You're absolutely right.
I don't know what I was thinking.

11:59.354 --> 12:01.263
MRI?

12:03.814 --> 12:05.273
- How is it?
- Completely healed.

12:05.441 --> 12:07.728
- You were in X-ray so long.
- Need some more ice?

12:10.443 --> 12:13.609
- Is there a fracture?
- No.

12:13.779 --> 12:16.149
A dislocation in the interphalangeal joint.

12:16.321 --> 12:20.317
- Tip of your index finger.
- I know where it is, Carter.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.317
Well, it's great there's no fracture.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.408
You can forget about the gastroplasty,
but a fracture...

12:25.576 --> 12:27.615
...could've kept you
out of surgery months.

12:28.036 --> 12:30.906
- What are you doing?
- We have to numb it and get a reduce.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.821
You want me to call somebody else?

12:34.122 --> 12:35.914
Get on with it.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.702
- Must hurt like crazy.
- Yeah.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.496
- Slammed it in the car door, did you?
- Yeah.

12:42.669 --> 12:44.246
Carter, is Dr. Benton...?

12:46.128 --> 12:49.164
They need you in Trauma 1, Peter,
right away.

12:53.299 --> 12:56.169
- I can't find it either.
- BP's falling. 70/30.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.426
- This guy's in fib.
- Pulse, 150. I can barely feel it.

12:59.594 --> 13:02.464
- What do we got?
- Multiple trauma. Hypovolemic shock.

13:02.638 --> 13:06.716
- Can't get a central line.
- Cut-down time. Carter will do it.

13:11.393 --> 13:13.300
He's ready.

13:14.186 --> 13:17.304
- You're ready.
- Okay. Let's go.

13:20.564 --> 13:24.062
Not the ankle, femoral.
And the saphenous is superficial here.

13:24.233 --> 13:27.601
And believe me, you do not
want to transect it. Okay?

13:31.279 --> 13:33.768
- Any luck with sitters?
- I've got a few leads.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.903
She needs a change, Joanie.

13:36.073 --> 13:38.397
We don't recommend extended care
for infants.

13:38.907 --> 13:42.654
Well, it's only temporary.
Chloe kind of left me in a lurch.

13:42.826 --> 13:45.114
Us too. Susie's bill
is three weeks overdue.

13:45.328 --> 13:47.402
No, it's my bill,
and I'll pay you tomorrow.

13:47.578 --> 13:51.076
Just try and make it up
a couple of times today, okay?

13:53.373 --> 13:56.160
Okay, okay. Bye-bye.

13:59.710 --> 14:02.035
Save her noon bottle for me.

14:16.468 --> 14:20.416
Randi, I have a babysitter coming
around 4:00 for an interview.

14:20.595 --> 14:23.263
- Could you keep an eye out for her?
- You bet.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.003
- Did anyone find you a lab coat yet?
- Doesn't fit.

14:26.182 --> 14:28.886
- Tonight there's just the two of us.
- No Hulda?

14:29.059 --> 14:32.177
- She's off to Helsinki.
- People come and go so quickly.

14:32.352 --> 14:35.221
We will drink beer and watch the Bears.

14:35.395 --> 14:38.644
Dr. Ross, what do we do with this?
She said she didn't have to wait.

14:38.814 --> 14:42.644
This is a "Go directly to Dr. Ross" card.
Is anybody in Iso?

14:42.816 --> 14:46.858
- I don't think so.
- Hey, Mei-Sun. How's our boy today?

14:47.193 --> 14:49.481
Okay? Okay.

14:51.779 --> 14:54.732
- How are things going?
- Keeping busy.

14:54.906 --> 14:57.231
- I haven't seen Chloe lately.
- None of us have.

14:57.407 --> 15:00.110
- How is she doing in school?
- You got a few minutes?

15:00.283 --> 15:04.658
Mark, sorry to interrupt.
There's a patient threatening to sue.

15:04.827 --> 15:08.277
- Is it okay if I handle it?
- Would you? Bless you.

15:09.705 --> 15:13.487
- What were you saying?
- Just how busy we've all been.

15:13.665 --> 15:16.914
Excuse me, I got a weak-and-dizzy
to check on.

15:18.376 --> 15:21.874
Thanks for giving me a chance with
that cut-down. I think it went smooth.

15:22.045 --> 15:24.879
- That was lidocaine without epi, right?
- Does it matter?

15:26.463 --> 15:29.961
Joke. I'm joking. No epi.
How does it feel?

15:30.132 --> 15:32.754
- It's numb.
- Get ready, because I'm gonna pull it.

15:32.927 --> 15:34.835
Just do it.

15:36.803 --> 15:39.210
Okay. And flex.

15:39.388 --> 15:42.341
Looks pretty good.
Check lateral stability.

15:42.515 --> 15:45.882
- The tendons are okay.
- Congratulations. What a relief.

15:47.475 --> 15:49.551
You're welcome.

15:49.727 --> 15:52.845
- County General, this is Unit 47.
- Go ahead, 47.

15:53.020 --> 15:57.846
- Calling for a noon radio check.
- We did the a. m. Check an hour ago.

15:58.023 --> 16:02.683
- Go ahead. Switch to Med 4.
- I'm sending you some calibrations.

16:02.859 --> 16:05.016
Read calibrations, 10-2.

16:05.193 --> 16:07.269
Great. I'll see you
when I see you, County.

16:07.445 --> 16:11.571
- What was that about?
- I'd say he wanted to hear your voice.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.653
Car door, huh? Get it splinted,
and you're gonna need an MRI.

16:16.824 --> 16:19.196
The x-rays looked good.
I don't think it's broken.

16:19.369 --> 16:22.118
If you end up with a leave,
you'll screw up my schedule.

16:22.286 --> 16:25.451
- You don't have to worry...
- $6000 worth of prosthetics.

16:25.621 --> 16:30.410
- Listen, how about I buy you lunch?
- Somebody's gonna pay for those!

16:30.581 --> 16:32.539
Maybe a little soup.

16:32.709 --> 16:35.745
I got a call for a pickup. Dvorak Park.

16:36.138 --> 16:39.704
Park bench, southwest corner.
She was laid out just like this.

16:40.211 --> 16:42.833
Okay. Let's get her inside.

16:43.006 --> 16:47.048
This was pinned to her.
It's got some cash inside.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.133
- I took out my fare.
- Yeah, great.

16:54.261 --> 16:58.472
- My, my, what do you know?
- She's pregnant at 14.

16:58.640 --> 17:02.302
And her mom's along.
We keeping you up?

17:02.474 --> 17:05.592
Susie woke up six times last night.
How did you raise four?

17:05.767 --> 17:09.598
Graveyard shift, no OT for four years
and a husband who works flex time.

17:09.770 --> 17:11.394
Just shoot me now.

17:11.561 --> 17:14.098
Pay close attention.
You'll practice this drill a lot.

17:14.271 --> 17:15.999
I thought we'd never get out of here.

17:16.074 --> 17:17.876
Today's all-city finals, volleyball.

17:17.925 --> 17:20.435
Amy's the only freshman playing varsity.

17:20.609 --> 17:25.150
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- I knew it must be pretty bad.

17:25.319 --> 17:30.026
She claims that it's cramps,
but I had appendicitis when I was 12.

17:30.197 --> 17:34.987
- I'm not 12.
- Lf you'll step outside, I'll examine Amy.

17:35.158 --> 17:38.074
I'll stay. I always do.

17:38.410 --> 17:42.157
We've found that kids,
after a certain age...

17:42.329 --> 17:45.328
...develop a better rapport with doctors
if they're one on one.

17:45.497 --> 17:48.532
- I like your earrings.
- Thanks.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.955
My daughter and I
don't have any secrets.

17:53.127 --> 17:57.536
Harper, why don't you get started,
and I'll show Mrs. Tubbs to the lounge.

17:59.297 --> 18:04.121
You did the right thing. It's just an ear
infection, but you can't be too careful.

18:04.299 --> 18:08.129
- Is okay with his HIV?
- It's fine. I'll be right back.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.258
- I need to talk about my assignments.
- It's a random rotation.

18:14.429 --> 18:17.843
I've been randomly rotating through
headaches and gas pains all week.

18:18.014 --> 18:20.219
- I'm only getting the boring cases.
- Look...

18:20.392 --> 18:25.098
...maybe I am going light on you. I've
noticed you have personal obligations.

18:25.269 --> 18:28.635
- I thought you might need slack.
- I've got a kid with chickenpox.

18:28.811 --> 18:31.847
- Put him in the Iso Room.
- Okay. This way.

18:33.189 --> 18:38.145
If there's anything affecting my ability
to do my job, I'll let you know.

18:38.317 --> 18:42.064
- No, there's somebody already in there!
- It's not on the board.

18:42.278 --> 18:46.441
He's a kid with AIDS. He doesn't
need to be exposed to chickenpox.

18:46.656 --> 18:50.187
No kidding. Maybe you could let us in
on the secret that he's here.

18:50.364 --> 18:52.856
Lydia, why don't you see
if Exam Room 4 is open?

18:53.034 --> 18:55.903
Doug, next time, make sure
your patient's on the board.

18:56.370 --> 18:59.868
Kerry, wanna take a look at this?

19:04.081 --> 19:06.867
It's not appendicitis, is it?

19:09.626 --> 19:11.783
How long have you been sexually active?

19:11.961 --> 19:15.044
I told him that stuff wouldn't work
without a condom.

19:15.212 --> 19:17.204
Well, it didn't.

19:19.256 --> 19:20.998
Don't tell my mom.

19:21.883 --> 19:25.878
- By law, I'm not permitted to tell her.
- Good.

19:26.385 --> 19:30.132
Okay. We'll talk about your options
when all your results are in.

19:30.303 --> 19:35.212
Since you had unprotected sex, we'll
test for gonorrhea, chlamydia and HIV.

19:35.389 --> 19:36.717
I don't have that.

19:36.890 --> 19:38.799
- Have you had more than one partner?
- No.

19:38.976 --> 19:41.179
Has he?

19:46.729 --> 19:50.475
Amy, whatever the results are,
or whatever you decide to do...

19:52.023 --> 19:54.560
...you're gonna need
someone's support.

19:56.444 --> 19:58.185
Your mom seems to care.

20:03.364 --> 20:07.109
- She was delivered by taxi?
- No name, but her history's all there.

20:07.281 --> 20:10.446
End-stage multiple sclerosis.
Partially paralyzed, incontinent...

20:10.616 --> 20:12.775
...sight impaired, possible dementia.

20:12.952 --> 20:15.986
- Beautifully brushed hair.
- "She likes an open window at night. "

20:16.161 --> 20:19.114
- She's also got pneumonia.
- Did you call the cops?

20:19.330 --> 20:22.863
- Then what else can we do?
- Admit her.

20:23.749 --> 20:25.824
I'll call upstairs.

20:29.710 --> 20:31.203
Mr. Carter.

20:32.337 --> 20:35.005
Looks like you and I
have a gastroplasty in an hour.

20:35.798 --> 20:38.546
Are you up to speed
with the procedure?

20:40.883 --> 20:44.002
- Yes, I am.
- Good. I'll see you both there. Peter...

20:44.219 --> 20:47.717
...I know you can't scrub in,
but there's a lot to learn by watching.

20:53.723 --> 20:55.762
No, I don't understand.

20:55.933 --> 21:00.509
If you have three discharges and one
admit, you should have two open beds.

21:01.395 --> 21:06.553
Yes, she has MS. She's also got
pneumonia, so Neuro can't take her.

21:06.730 --> 21:09.220
Well, when can you get back to me?

21:09.733 --> 21:15.518
Excuse me. I got a Deluxe Jalapeño,
fried, for a Tom Perry in Curtain 3.

21:15.693 --> 21:17.150
- There.
- Thanks.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.231
- It'll just be a few moments.
- I saw the ultrasound machine.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.692
- She's pregnant, isn't she?
- I can't discuss it.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.856
- Of course not. I'm her mother...
- I know...

21:25.032 --> 21:28.779
...the one who spent 14 years sacrificing
so that she could have every chance.

21:28.950 --> 21:33.028
I'll have to foot the bill for this baby or
face our priest when she doesn't have it.

21:33.203 --> 21:34.529
So sure, ignore me.

21:34.702 --> 21:38.035
- I understand that this is difficult...
- You're not a mother, are you?

21:38.205 --> 21:40.955
- No, I'm not.
- Then don't dismiss me.

21:43.416 --> 21:45.872
And don't try to keep me away
from my baby.

21:47.293 --> 21:49.203
- Call Security.
- There's no need.

21:49.378 --> 21:52.711
- The girl's privacy...
- She's ready to tell her mom.

21:53.757 --> 21:58.961
Sometimes it's the boring case
that turns into the real challenge.

22:02.719 --> 22:05.504
If you're considering violence,
count me in.

22:05.679 --> 22:07.754
It's not just me!

22:11.182 --> 22:14.015
There's no politically correct way
to describe that woman.

22:14.183 --> 22:15.593
I'll see if I can find her.

22:15.767 --> 22:20.261
- Anybody seen Dr. Weaver?
- Follow the trail of digested Residents.

22:21.645 --> 22:23.389
Dr. Lewis. Childcare called.

22:23.564 --> 22:26.349
Should they hold Susie's noon bottle?
It's almost 1:00.

22:26.565 --> 22:28.971
Tell them to feed her.
I'll be up as soon as I can.

22:29.191 --> 22:31.764
Go on up, take a break.
You're allowed to have a life.

22:31.943 --> 22:34.895
- I'm waiting on some labs.
- Weaver has you playing her game.

22:35.069 --> 22:38.567
You think if you ace all the details,
she's gonna stop nitpicking?

22:38.738 --> 22:40.647
Probably not.

22:40.822 --> 22:45.696
"You know, Susan, you didn't put
your X's in the middle of the box. "

22:45.866 --> 22:50.528
"I know it's trivial, but could you say
'sahntimeter' instead of centimeter?"

22:50.786 --> 22:53.988
"Couldn't you second-guess
yourself sometimes...

22:54.163 --> 22:56.914
...instead of me always having to do it?"

23:28.556 --> 23:32.303
What does that mean, they "may"
have a bed after 7? Are they building it?

23:32.475 --> 23:35.047
I called all the nursing homes.
Nobody's AWOL.

23:35.227 --> 23:38.925
We know she didn't walk to the park
and call her own taxi.

23:40.481 --> 23:43.017
County General, this is Unit 47.

23:43.190 --> 23:44.980
This is County General. Go ahead, 47.

23:45.149 --> 23:47.816
We're at the scene
with an adolescent female.

23:47.982 --> 23:51.315
GSW to the chest, guessing a 9 mm.

23:51.484 --> 23:56.644
She's unresponsive, shallow resps
at eight. Pulse, 13. BP, 9/5.

23:56.822 --> 23:59.655
- Have you started fluids?
- Two IVs going. Wide open.

23:59.823 --> 24:02.492
- Copy that. What's your ETA?
- Just about to pull out.

24:02.659 --> 24:04.365
We ought to be there...

24:05.243 --> 24:07.945
- Damn!
- What's going on?

24:08.160 --> 24:10.735
They're shooting at us.
Gunfire at the scene!

24:11.080 --> 24:13.485
- Let's get out of here!
- Somebody's down out there.

24:13.663 --> 24:14.991
I'm going after him!

24:15.164 --> 24:17.868
- 47?
- Don't do that, man.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.579
Shep? Shep?

24:28.214 --> 24:31.746
So I pull the trocar through
the stomach. CDH, 29.

24:31.922 --> 24:34.592
- What other options would we have?
- Roux-en-Y.

24:34.759 --> 24:37.628
Anastomose the jejunum
to the stomach.

24:37.802 --> 24:40.884
Benini and Forse claim
that vertical-banded gastroplasty...

24:41.054 --> 24:43.969
...preserves the gastroduodenal
continuity.

24:44.179 --> 24:47.593
- Where did you read that?
- Gastroenterology. This month.

24:47.764 --> 24:51.975
Okay, I gave it a shot, but that
rain-forest crap is driving me nuts.

24:52.185 --> 24:54.853
Toilets flushing.
That's how they make that sound.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.555
Peter, you're not sterile.
Would you mind changing it?

24:58.939 --> 25:00.267
Any requests?

25:01.313 --> 25:03.022
Silence is fine.

25:08.986 --> 25:11.225
Okay. We're ready.

25:11.403 --> 25:14.107
RL 90 stapler, please.

25:15.406 --> 25:17.812
It's all yours, Mr. Carter.

25:22.701 --> 25:26.827
Any words of wisdom for your student
before he staples his first stomach?

25:27.036 --> 25:28.695
Or have you done one of these?

25:30.664 --> 25:33.285
No, I haven't.

25:34.332 --> 25:37.285
You only get one chance,
and there's no undoing it.

25:37.502 --> 25:40.618
Calm and steady.
Advance the pin button.

25:41.961 --> 25:44.533
Line up the gap indicator.

25:47.339 --> 25:49.876
Release the trigger safety.

25:52.466 --> 25:53.842
Fire.

25:59.555 --> 26:01.011
Nice.

26:03.807 --> 26:07.471
Are you kidding? All the single-parent
kids I see? You should be scared.

26:07.642 --> 26:09.930
I'm worried about what's best
for Little Susie.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.390
- Told Mark yet?
- No, and I'd rather you didn't.

26:12.562 --> 26:17.269
If you do consider adoption,
there's a neurosurgeon up on eight.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.312
His name's Kevin Halloran, a great guy.

26:19.481 --> 26:22.814
He and his wife have adopted already,
and they've been looking.

26:22.983 --> 26:26.268
No. I mean, I was thinking of
adopting Susie.

26:27.403 --> 26:28.730
Oh. Okay.

26:34.157 --> 26:36.397
- Feeling better?
- Hey, doc!

26:36.574 --> 26:40.617
The hospital food didn't sit too well,
so I ordered me up some takeout...

26:40.785 --> 26:43.357
...to settle my stomach.
- You have to stop eating.

26:44.912 --> 26:46.240
For how long?

26:46.705 --> 26:49.490
We'll try an hour. See how you're doing.

26:49.664 --> 26:54.905
Your cardiac workup's negative, but if
you keep gorging, it won't stay like that.

26:55.084 --> 26:58.416
It's hard for him.
He really loves his food.

26:58.585 --> 27:01.834
If he eats himself to death by 40,
he'll miss a lot of meals.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.921
Could you order up me another
of those drinks? It seemed to help.

27:07.132 --> 27:09.088
Promise not to chase it with an éclair?

27:11.426 --> 27:13.086
Éclair.

27:15.511 --> 27:19.376
I'm at County General. The paramedic
unit was calling from Archer Court.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.713
We need some help here.

27:25.559 --> 27:29.056
Single GSW to the chest.
BP, 100/60. Pulse is 102.

27:29.269 --> 27:31.889
Resps at 32,
diminished breath sounds on the right.

27:32.062 --> 27:34.268
Would've called in,
but our radio got shot out.

27:34.439 --> 27:37.887
- Is there another victim?
- Guy in the street playing possum.

27:38.066 --> 27:40.603
- Didn't want to get shot.
- Sounds smart.

27:41.607 --> 27:46.067
Okay. Here we go.
Watch yourself, guys. Hang on.

27:46.486 --> 27:49.735
On my count. Ready. One, two, three.

27:49.905 --> 27:52.312
That's a big 12-year-old.

27:52.782 --> 27:55.105
She's got a hemothorax.
Set up a chest-tube tray.

27:55.323 --> 27:57.447
- 28 French?
- Sounds about right.

28:02.954 --> 28:07.578
It's a little crowded in here, 47. Why not
take out your stuff and wait in the hall?

28:13.668 --> 28:17.368
- How's our mystery guest doing?
- The same.

28:17.670 --> 28:19.709
She stopped moaning.

28:22.922 --> 28:25.163
- Okay, we're moving her.
- Found a bed?

28:25.340 --> 28:28.007
Not yet. But it's a big hospital.

28:28.884 --> 28:30.924
Got it? Let's go.

28:32.094 --> 28:35.343
- Listen, lady, now, you got to tell me!
- Sir, just simmer down.

28:35.513 --> 28:37.505
But she's my niece!

28:37.681 --> 28:40.349
- Where is she?
- Hey, buddy, what can we do for you?

28:40.516 --> 28:43.088
- He's the uncle of the girl you brought.
- She's okay?

28:43.267 --> 28:46.266
- Sir, your niece was shot...
- No, not Poovey! I got to see her!

28:46.435 --> 28:48.676
- Lf you could calm down...
- Where is she?

28:48.853 --> 28:50.180
Hey, hey, hey!

28:50.354 --> 28:54.812
- 200 cc's in the Thora-Seal.
- Good bilateral breath sounds.

28:54.981 --> 28:57.686
Take the IV out. Pulse rate is up.

28:57.859 --> 29:00.894
- Pulse ox up to 100.
- Oh, mercy.

29:04.195 --> 29:06.566
She must be carrying a kilo.

29:13.325 --> 29:15.897
- Hey! Hey!
- He may have a gun, you guys!

29:21.745 --> 29:23.619
You dumb, dealing son of a bitch!

29:24.163 --> 29:26.950
Were you shooting at us? Were you?

29:27.166 --> 29:31.161
Were you shooting at us? Watch out!
Huh? Did you shoot at that kid?

29:31.335 --> 29:35.377
Did you shoot? Out of my way!
Did you shoot that little girl?

29:36.295 --> 29:39.379
I am gonna kick your ass. Come here!

29:42.257 --> 29:44.960
Did you shoot that kid?

29:47.886 --> 29:50.589
- Did you? Huh?
- Take him in, take him in!

29:50.762 --> 29:52.588
Got them both, got them both.

29:53.304 --> 29:56.424
Don't inhale this stuff. It'll mess you up.

30:10.648 --> 30:14.146
Susan, your babysitter is here.
I sent her to the snack bar.

30:14.317 --> 30:17.066
- Half an hour ago. I forgot.
- Oh, my God.

30:17.233 --> 30:21.361
Lily, could you give 30 cc's of this
to Mr. Perry in Curtain 3?

30:21.527 --> 30:24.362
- You bet. Go on. Go.
- Okay, thanks. Thanks.

30:27.324 --> 30:30.488
- What do you think?
- Right feels lucky.

30:38.328 --> 30:40.784
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

30:40.956 --> 30:43.908
I'm Mark Greene, Attending in the ER.
Maybe we spoke.

30:44.124 --> 30:45.451
Nothing in there.

30:45.624 --> 30:47.782
- We're looking for a room.
- A bed would do.

30:47.958 --> 30:51.906
- A room would be much better.
- You know the proper channels.

30:52.085 --> 30:55.334
I tried them, and this nice lady still
had no room for the night.

30:55.504 --> 30:58.208
What do we have here?
Hey, look, there's a bed.

30:58.381 --> 31:01.167
And it has an open window.

31:04.468 --> 31:08.132
- This is perfect. We'll take it.
- Do you want me to call the supervisor?

31:08.303 --> 31:11.256
Not unless you wanna explain why
you won't handle an admit...

31:11.431 --> 31:14.679
...45 minutes before
the end of your shift.

31:15.932 --> 31:17.758
Thank you.

31:20.434 --> 31:22.307
I think she likes it.

31:23.687 --> 31:27.184
- Three hours a day would be perfect.
- That would help me so much.

31:27.356 --> 31:30.189
I just can't stand having Susie
in daycare for so long.

31:30.357 --> 31:35.478
I know. I thought about putting Theresa
in one for two minutes. Not my child.

31:35.650 --> 31:38.603
- I'm sure the one here is very nice.
- Yeah, it is. It's great.

31:40.112 --> 31:43.444
She's still breast-feeding.
There's a lot of salt in those.

31:43.822 --> 31:45.648
Oh, right.

31:46.532 --> 31:50.445
Well, where shall we start?
I'm on days till Monday.

31:50.743 --> 31:54.027
- Until Monday?
- My shift changes every three weeks.

31:54.203 --> 31:57.202
Twelve-hour days, 12-hour nights.

31:57.371 --> 32:01.284
- You'd need help at different times?
- We can work it out in advance.

32:01.457 --> 32:03.532
I didn't understand that on the phone.

32:04.333 --> 32:07.701
When I'm on nights, I do expect
to patchwork a little extra help.

32:09.544 --> 32:12.662
I'm so sorry. I can't help.
Theresa and I have a schedule.

32:12.838 --> 32:16.336
I thought I could work Susie in,
but I can't reshuffle week to week.

32:16.506 --> 32:20.004
- I understand.
- This is not a flexible time for us.

32:20.175 --> 32:24.337
You know babies.
They're such little creatures of habit.

32:24.511 --> 32:28.342
They need their patterns
to develop a sense of security.

32:33.307 --> 32:37.469
Hurry, hurry. It's his heart.
I knew when I saw it.

32:37.643 --> 32:39.017
- Did he drink this?
- Yes.

32:39.185 --> 32:40.727
The whole thing?

32:43.062 --> 32:48.646
- We've gotta pump his stomach, now!
- Whose patient is this?

32:54.819 --> 32:59.526
Hold still. You need this to inactivate
any Donnatal left in your stomach.

33:01.489 --> 33:05.270
- What happened?
- Mr. Perry just had a gastric lavage.

33:05.449 --> 33:09.943
After ingesting 500 cc's of Maalox,
lidocaine and Donnatal.

33:10.118 --> 33:12.489
- He drank the whole bottle?
- She gave it to us.

33:12.661 --> 33:15.531
- I gave him an ounce.
- But you left the bottle in here?

33:15.705 --> 33:18.657
Poor physician instructions
are not your responsibility.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.622
You don't know about my instructions.

33:20.791 --> 33:23.078
There was nothing on the chart.
You were gone.

33:23.250 --> 33:25.408
He has respiratory arrest
and you disappeared.

33:25.585 --> 33:28.999
- I told Randi...
- It's not her job to keep track of staff.

33:29.170 --> 33:31.791
Kerry, Susan, outside.

33:41.010 --> 33:45.336
It would've made no difference
if I had written a book on his chart.

33:45.512 --> 33:48.548
Obviously, I did not order him
to guzzle a quart of GI cocktail.

33:48.722 --> 33:52.303
So your carelessness didn't matter.
Shall we wait till someone dies?

33:52.517 --> 33:57.852
That's enough. When I'm finished,
I'll see you both in the lounge.

34:07.233 --> 34:09.639
- Still working?
- Yeah.

34:09.817 --> 34:12.022
I gotta cancel. Dr. Hicks
wants me to monitor...

34:12.023 --> 34:14.228
our gastroplasty in recovery.

34:14.402 --> 34:18.647
- Wow. Grown-up stuff.
- I was looking forward to tonight.

34:18.821 --> 34:20.779
Well, rain check.

34:22.782 --> 34:25.107
- Those are really nice.
- Thanks.

34:25.284 --> 34:27.525
How do you get them so even?

34:27.869 --> 34:31.152
Just practice. You'll get there.

34:33.163 --> 34:34.906
Am I in your light?

34:35.789 --> 34:37.366
No, no.

34:47.545 --> 34:49.501
Anything wrong, doc?

34:54.132 --> 34:55.710
We'll do it soon.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.544
Doc?

34:57.801 --> 35:01.086
No, sir. No, everything is fine.

35:04.139 --> 35:06.094
Please, sit down.

35:06.931 --> 35:10.263
What happened in front of that patient
can't ever happen again.

35:10.433 --> 35:14.014
You two have to work together.
I depend on both of you too much.

35:14.894 --> 35:17.135
I'm to blame for this situation.

35:17.312 --> 35:20.810
I haven't backed you up in the more
unpleasant aspects of your job.

35:20.981 --> 35:24.598
And I may have left the impression
that I don't support your work.

35:24.775 --> 35:26.518
So let me go on record.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.015
I am behind Kerry 100 percent.

35:29.192 --> 35:31.268
If you disagree with anything
she's doing...

35:31.446 --> 35:33.816
...assume that she's acting
with my approval.

35:33.988 --> 35:38.777
But if this department impedes
any Resident from doing their best...

35:38.948 --> 35:41.983
...then as chief, you have to respond.

35:44.326 --> 35:46.364
Any questions?

35:48.079 --> 35:49.868
That's it.

35:55.250 --> 35:58.748
Kerry, hold on. Susan is one of
the most gifted doctors I know.

35:58.918 --> 36:02.699
If she's having trouble working with you,
it's a problem I expect you to solve.

36:02.877 --> 36:06.825
Fine. I'll accept your criticism anytime,
but not in front of a Resident.

36:07.922 --> 36:10.757
It undermines my authority
and is completely inappropriate.

36:10.925 --> 36:15.418
That's how Susan felt when she was
being critiqued in front of a patient.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.341
I'd like to apologize for
what happened earlier today.

36:23.555 --> 36:27.802
It was inexcusable, and I am sorry.

36:27.976 --> 36:30.725
Apology accepted.

36:35.979 --> 36:38.648
What happened earlier today?

36:40.106 --> 36:43.391
It was a misunderstanding.
Having fun being where the buck stops?

36:43.566 --> 36:46.518
- Bring on the TV and beer.
- Well, no, actually...

36:46.693 --> 36:48.567
Hope you don't mind a threesome.

36:48.736 --> 36:51.737
- No problem.
- See you later. Let's go.

36:55.948 --> 36:57.774
Ortho concurred. No tendon damage.

36:57.949 --> 37:01.032
Keep the splint for 10 days
and you shouldn't need a leave.

37:01.201 --> 37:04.651
- That's good news.
- Get yourself a physical-therapy regimen.

37:04.828 --> 37:08.825
- You know Jeanie Boulet, right?
- I'll take care of it.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.794
- Multiple trauma just pulled up.
- I'll get it.

37:19.253 --> 37:21.125
I'll join you in 2.

37:27.257 --> 37:29.361
35-year-old recycling worker...

37:29.362 --> 37:31.466
fell 15 feet off a
catwalk onto a machine.

37:31.634 --> 37:34.634
BP's 50 palp, pulse, 56.
No spontaneous resps.

37:34.803 --> 37:37.470
GCS, five.
Moves extremities times four.

37:37.637 --> 37:39.925
- What is that thing?
- Some kind of a crusher.

37:40.097 --> 37:42.716
No distal pulse in that extremity.

37:43.891 --> 37:46.345
- Hot date tonight?
- Almost.

37:46.517 --> 37:49.220
- When did her husband show up?
- Half an hour ago.

37:49.393 --> 37:51.301
Social worker is on her way.

37:51.479 --> 37:55.261
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I didn't wanna send you away...

37:55.438 --> 37:58.439
...but I couldn't shampoo your hair
the way you like it.

37:59.565 --> 38:01.808
Or get your pills straight.

38:02.775 --> 38:04.648
Or change the bed.

38:07.319 --> 38:10.687
I never thought the day would come
when I couldn't pick you up.

38:10.863 --> 38:14.811
Even after the boys were gone,
you were always a feather.

38:15.367 --> 38:18.735
I can't afford the kind of place
that you should have.

38:19.202 --> 38:21.192
But I...

38:24.829 --> 38:27.782
I thought it would be better for you here.

38:34.667 --> 38:36.292
I missed her too much.

38:45.382 --> 38:47.919
Damn it, we're losing the arm.
Where's maintenance?

38:48.134 --> 38:50.374
Here. I found these.

38:50.593 --> 38:53.297
BP's 50 palp. This guy's bleeding out.

38:53.511 --> 38:56.130
No, he's not. No internal injuries.
Lavage is negative.

38:56.346 --> 38:58.422
Come on.

38:59.848 --> 39:01.391
No pelvic fracture.

39:02.891 --> 39:05.595
- CBC is normal.
- Come on.

39:05.810 --> 39:07.917
- Come on!
- Anion gap,

39:07.918 --> 39:09.794
metabolic acidosis.

39:10.354 --> 39:12.843
- Do they use chemicals?
- This place was a real dump.

39:13.021 --> 39:16.638
Recycled junk everywhere.
A lot of old x-ray cartridges.

39:16.816 --> 39:20.433
Blood gas shows decreased
AV differential. Could be cyanide.

39:20.610 --> 39:22.269
- Doesn't make sense.
- Why not?

39:22.444 --> 39:25.610
Stripping x-rays, they could be using
cyanide illegally.

39:29.115 --> 39:33.191
We need a pressure dressing here.
How are those retinal veins?

39:33.365 --> 39:36.982
Bright red. Get a cyanide kit.
300 sodium nitrate.

39:40.495 --> 39:43.363
Hang the thiosulfate, 50 cc's.

39:50.792 --> 39:53.875
Yeah, he's pinking up.
Guess you were right.

39:54.420 --> 39:56.908
Remind me never to arm wrestle you.

39:57.086 --> 40:00.418
Damn, we're an hour over.
I had dinner plans.

40:00.588 --> 40:04.335
Oh, Susie! What time is it?
Daycare closes at 7. Can you call them?

40:04.758 --> 40:09.630
- You can go. I'll take him up to OR.
- No, it's okay. I'll stay.

40:15.348 --> 40:19.638
Stay on top of it and see what
the social worker comes up with.

40:19.807 --> 40:22.972
- Carol, long day?
- Yeah, for my day off.

40:23.141 --> 40:25.219
- Is Susan still around?
- I don't think so.

40:25.395 --> 40:28.228
She had to get out early,
picking up Little Susie and all.

40:28.396 --> 40:32.806
- She spends a lot of time with that baby.
- Yeah, since Chloe flew the coop.

40:32.981 --> 40:35.935
- Chloe's gone?
- Where have you been?

40:36.107 --> 40:37.850
I gotta get that.

40:41.903 --> 40:46.562
- County General, this is 47.
- It's the other one. What's his name?

40:46.738 --> 40:51.198
- County General. I read you, 47.
- Raul. Is he dating anyone?

40:51.367 --> 40:54.651
Calling in for a radio check
on our new set.

40:54.826 --> 40:57.066
I hear you loud and clear.

40:59.913 --> 41:02.747
If there's nothing else, I'll sign off.

41:02.914 --> 41:06.033
Just thought that you ought to
answer your phone.

41:06.916 --> 41:09.750
- 47 out.
- I was wondering if we should get that.

41:19.924 --> 41:23.670
- Hello?
- Nurse Hathaway. Look...

41:23.883 --> 41:27.499
...I'm sorry if I got in your way
on that last call.

41:27.676 --> 41:29.301
You didn't.

41:29.469 --> 41:32.256
- I thought I made you angry.
- You didn't.

41:32.429 --> 41:36.341
Let me just ask you.
If you weren't mad...

41:36.514 --> 41:41.341
...were you maybe worried?

41:41.518 --> 41:44.352
About what? You running out
in the middle of sniper fire...

41:44.519 --> 41:46.926
...or chasing an armed man
through the ER?

41:48.313 --> 41:50.305
You were worried!

41:52.150 --> 41:54.225
I thought something was going on here.

41:54.401 --> 41:57.732
I thought maybe I was getting to you,
and I know you're getting to me.

41:57.902 --> 42:01.186
That's great. You were worried.

42:01.362 --> 42:03.768
All right. So what if I was?

42:08.366 --> 42:12.409
Oh, hello.
I thought you were flying out today.

42:12.577 --> 42:15.362
Fog. No Doug yet.

42:15.577 --> 42:18.115
No? Good. I mean...

42:18.288 --> 42:21.786
Would you like to go out
for a drink quick? A quick drink?

42:21.998 --> 42:24.915
- I'm not dressed.
- Yeah, I've noticed that about you.

42:25.084 --> 42:27.916
But if you got dressed, we could go out.

42:28.377 --> 42:31.329
Mark, are you flirting with me?

42:31.504 --> 42:34.502
No, I was just going out
for a drink anyway.

42:34.671 --> 42:37.956
I'm just gonna drop off my dinner.

42:38.132 --> 42:42.626
- So why don't we go?
- Okay, I come.

42:43.969 --> 42:46.671
- Now, don't be long.
- Okay.

42:52.098 --> 42:55.300
Oh, great.
Mark, you've got the cards out?

42:55.475 --> 42:57.680
No, I...

43:00.478 --> 43:02.434
Something wrong?

43:03.813 --> 43:07.143
Mark, should I...? Doug. Hello.

43:07.314 --> 43:08.808
- Hello.
- Hello.

43:11.316 --> 43:13.984
My friend Hulda and I,
we were just going.

43:14.193 --> 43:15.567
Relax, Mark.

43:15.735 --> 43:20.976
I think Hulda and I can read
the situation. I'm Linda.

43:21.156 --> 43:23.608
Did we have a scheduling mix-up?

43:24.950 --> 43:26.905
Looks that way.

43:27.074 --> 43:30.856
So one, two, three, four.
Let's have a drink.

43:31.035 --> 43:34.402
- Sounds great.
- Or play bridge. Nice, even number.

43:34.579 --> 43:37.696
Thanks, but no thanks.
I gotta call my wife.

43:38.207 --> 43:40.777
So let me count, that makes three.
Am I right?

43:40.956 --> 43:42.617
Mark, it's early.

43:45.043 --> 43:47.249
Have fun. Good night.

43:58.007 --> 44:00.498
Hi. I'm not in.

44:01.259 --> 44:04.295
Hi, Susan. Mark.
I found out about Chloe.

44:05.429 --> 44:08.132
Guess we haven't been talking much.

44:08.472 --> 44:12.004
Listen, if you need anything, call. Okay?

44:12.559 --> 44:14.514
I'm at Doug's.

44:15.183 --> 44:16.760
Miss you.
