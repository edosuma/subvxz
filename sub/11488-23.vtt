00:00.640 --> 00:02.510
真遗憾你必须要走了

00:02.520 --> 00:04.290
I don't have to go.

00:04.300 --> 00:07.210
I mean,i'm sorry i have work to do,
so you can't stay.

00:07.220 --> 00:10.380
Didn't you hear me?
I can stay.

00:10.390 --> 00:13.900
Yeah,i wish you could...

00:15.020 --> 00:19.360
But there's no way i'd be able to
 concentrate with you around.

00:19.370 --> 00:22.030
Don't forget your sweater.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.620
Oh,you are so thoughtful.
Most guys aren't.

00:24.630 --> 00:30.110
Most guys are selfish,hateful bastards,
who just want to use you and throw you away.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.510
Damn them.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.560
Anything else you might have overlooked-- 

00:36.570 --> 00:40.780
Cell phone,earrings?Any medications?

00:41.600 --> 00:45.150
Hang on.Nope,i'm all set.

00:45.160 --> 00:48.350
Good,good.
Okay,well,i'll see you soon.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.290
- How soon?
- Very soon.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.400
- So you'll call?
- What do you think?

00:52.410 --> 00:56.360
- I think you'll call.
- Well,there you go.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.700
- So when will you call?
- Soon.

00:59.710 --> 01:02.950
- How soon?
- We're back on this ride,huh?

01:03.340 --> 01:06.870
Okay,very soon.
Bye-bye now.

01:11.770 --> 01:15.410
- When will i learn?
- soon.

01:16.010 --> 01:18.000
Very soon.

01:18.010 --> 01:22.440
Don't tell me,tell the cockeyed optimist
 in my pants.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.860
- So where'd you find this one?
- The animal shelter.

01:26.520 --> 01:31.420
- So,we getting a pet?
- Are you crazy?We've already got your kid.

01:32.250 --> 01:34.080
Then what were you doing there?

01:34.090 --> 01:37.640
Standing within earshot of attractive 
women and mumbling

01:37.650 --> 01:41.830
gee,i wish i could adopt them all.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.860
It's foolproof.

01:44.870 --> 01:47.140
Listen,there's something 
i need to talk to you about.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.770
You know the difference between you and me,alan?

01:49.780 --> 01:52.890
I don't scream when i pee?

01:52.900 --> 01:55.760
I took care of that.

01:55.770 --> 02:00.860
No,the difference between you and me 
is i have vision-- i see what others don't.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.180
Terrific.Anyway,the thing i wanted to tell you...

02:02.190 --> 02:07.120
You look at an animal shelter and see homeless
 dogs and kitties about to be put to death.

02:07.130 --> 02:10.880
Me-- i see an ass farm.

02:10.889 --> 02:13.540
Okay,i'm speechless.

02:13.550 --> 02:18.090
No words necessary.
Silent admiration is all i ask.

02:18.810 --> 02:22.350
So,what is it you wanted to tell me?

02:26.860 --> 02:28.890
The railing's a little loose.

02:39.940 --> 02:44.010
oh,i got to stop falling off the deck sober.

02:47.030 --> 02:49.940
Buenos dias.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.620
Huevos rancheros.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.320
Morning.How are you feeling?

02:59.330 --> 03:04.030
Like i feel eight feet onto splintered wood,
wet sand and a dead crab.

03:04.040 --> 03:08.430
I can only think your highly inflated ego might 
have broken your fall.

03:08.440 --> 03:12.760
So where'd you find pancho bob villa out there?

03:13.650 --> 03:16.390
- You know those fliers that get left in your mailbox all the time?
- Yeah.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.750
Well,i take them and file them 
according to category.

03:21.790 --> 03:25.330
Take-out menus,rug sales,carpet cleaning,
plumbing,tiling...

03:25.340 --> 03:29.340
Fernando was under handyman services

03:30.190 --> 03:33.670
You're going to live here forever,aren't you?

03:33.680 --> 03:37.130
He's licensed,he's bonded,he's punctual 
and he's reasonably priced.

03:37.140 --> 03:38.780
Are you paying him?

03:38.790 --> 03:43.100
No,but i'm saving you 20% with 
this valuable coupon.

03:43.460 --> 03:46.790
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:46.800 --> 03:51.200
What in the heck is...
Oh,yum.

03:52.270 --> 03:55.880
- Who is that?
- He's a handyman.

03:55.890 --> 03:58.960
Ooh,nice.Can we keep him?Can we,can we?

03:58.970 --> 04:01.710
- He's just here to fix the deck.
- Great.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.290
There's a lot of work that
 can be done in here,too.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.620
Like what?

04:05.630 --> 04:09.750
Well,for starters,that cabinet door's 
coming off its hinges.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.930
Really?

04:17.130 --> 04:19.579
No,it's not.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.310
Yeah,it is.

04:30.430 --> 04:35.370
He looks parched.
I'll take him some rum.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.810
See,my problem is,is that i'm a giver.

04:42.820 --> 04:47.370
I love too much.
And it's always the wrong man.

04:47.380 --> 04:51.420
- You have romance in your heart.
- Oh,i have romance all over me.

04:51.430 --> 04:55.800
I reek of it.Another mojito?

04:55.810 --> 04:59.060
Oh,no-- one is my limit 
when i work with power tools.

04:59.070 --> 05:04.320
That's smart.We wouldn't want you to 
lose one of those beautiful thumbs.

05:04.330 --> 05:07.200
- Berta?
- What?

05:07.210 --> 05:10.640
- I just thought maybe it's almost lunchtime...
- Oh,yeah.

05:10.650 --> 05:13.140
Quesadilla,bright eyes?

05:13.150 --> 05:15.760
- Thank you.
- Coming up.

05:15.770 --> 05:17.200
Actually,i'd rather have a sandwich...

05:17.210 --> 05:21.750
- I'm making quesadillas!
- Quesadillas,fine.

05:22.210 --> 05:25.980
So,fernando,how's it going?

05:26.280 --> 05:28.830
Oh,sorry to tell you this,
but you have a problem here.

05:28.840 --> 05:32.690
Just don't let her corner you in the 
laundry room and you'll be fine.

05:32.700 --> 05:36.720
No,the deck.
When is the last time you put sealant on it?

05:36.730 --> 05:40.850
Well...Uh...What?

05:40.860 --> 05:44.150
Oh,ser,you cannot have wood untreated 
this close to the ocean.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.540
The moisture,she gets in and rots 
it from the inside.

05:47.550 --> 05:51.690
Where have i heard that before?
Oh right,my doctor.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.680
But it wasn't moisture,it was scotch.

05:53.690 --> 05:57.990
You need to replace the entire railing,
parts of the deck and the stairway to the beach.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.420
Well,why can't i just put on some of that sealant?

06:02.430 --> 06:06.880
You could do that,but it would be,
as we say order a una vaca muerta.

06:06.890 --> 06:10.870
- What's that mean?
- Milking a dead cow.

06:12.810 --> 06:18.640
Well,maybe before i commit to all this work,
i should get a second opinion.

06:18.650 --> 06:22.100
I understand.You are a smart and careful man.

06:25.770 --> 06:30.200
But i would hurry up before your deck falls off.

06:30.210 --> 06:33.360
Something else my doctor told me.

06:37.120 --> 06:38.940
Hello.

06:38.950 --> 06:42.370
Oh,hang on,i'll see if he's here.

06:43.590 --> 06:46.070
It's chloe.

06:47.170 --> 06:49.530
I need more than that,alan.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.150
The girl you adopted at the animal shelter.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.320
- Oh,god,she won't leave me alone.
- What do you want me to say?

06:57.330 --> 07:01.060
- I don't know; tell her i'm sick.
- Okay.

07:01.070 --> 07:04.970
- What do you have?
- What are you talking about?

07:04.980 --> 07:08.080
Are you bedridden or ambulatory?

07:09.370 --> 07:12.320
- Bedridden.
- Got it.

07:12.830 --> 07:16.510
- Is if viral or bacterial?
- What?

07:16.520 --> 07:19.550
If i'm going to lie convincingly,i need details.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.440
I don't know-- i got a bug.

07:21.450 --> 07:24.520
Intestinal or bronchial?

07:24.530 --> 07:28.520
- Just tell her i got the flu,all right?
- Oh,good,the flu.

07:28.530 --> 07:31.420
Is it coming out both ends?

07:31.430 --> 07:34.490
Just give me the freakin' phone.

07:37.410 --> 07:40.000
No,it's okay,i want to talk to her.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.110
hello,chloe.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.550
No,i'm fine.Just a little bug.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.930
Doctor said i should be okay in a couple of weeks.

07:52.310 --> 07:56.720
Me too,baby.I'll call you.Soon.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.130
Very soon.

08:01.140 --> 08:03.730
See?Was that so hard?

08:03.740 --> 08:08.210
Well,to be fair,you had the advantage of
 making it a performance piece.

08:08.930 --> 08:11.370
- Hey,dawgs.
- Hey,jake.

08:11.380 --> 08:15.490
Alan,here,i need you to sign these papers
 for jake's summer school.

08:15.500 --> 08:19.230
- Summer school,again?
- Why not?He's getting good at it.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.920
Oh,my lord.Who is that?

08:23.230 --> 08:24.780
- That's my handyman.
- Really?

08:24.790 --> 08:26.860
I've been looking for a good handyman.

08:26.870 --> 08:30.670
- Well,it's a little soon to know how good he is...
- I'll find out.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.730
I'm starting to see a trend here.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:43.809 --> 08:47.040
That boney bitch!

08:52.130 --> 08:55.470
Yep,definitely a trend.

08:59.190 --> 09:02.060
Summer school three years in a row.

09:02.070 --> 09:04.850
They might as well just make you the janitor.

09:06.770 --> 09:08.620
Yeah,well,school sucks.

09:08.630 --> 09:12.010
That's because you go year-round.

09:12.330 --> 09:16.190
Imagine if you had a couple months
 off in the summer.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.920
If i were you,i'd start teaching him
 how to throw sawdust on vomit.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.940
I can do that.

09:22.950 --> 09:24.970
Why don't you just go start your homework?

09:24.980 --> 09:27.440
What's the point?
I'm already going to summer school.

09:27.450 --> 09:28.390
Jake...

09:28.400 --> 09:31.670
And if i flunk there,what can they do?
Send me to regular school?

09:31.680 --> 09:33.410
Go.

09:34.790 --> 09:39.020
Actually,that sawdust job may be a pipe dream.

09:41.270 --> 09:44.270
Is the big one gone?

09:44.280 --> 09:47.720
Yeah,she went to get something waxed.

09:47.730 --> 09:50.740
We were scared to ask what.

09:50.750 --> 09:53.900
I just wanted to tell you i was able to 
save you some money on the redwood.

09:53.910 --> 09:55.270
Oh,that's terrific.How?

09:55.280 --> 09:59.060
My cousin-- he works at a lumberyard and...

09:59.680 --> 10:02.190
That's all you need to know.

10:02.200 --> 10:05.980
- Well,thanks.
- No problem.I'll get back to work.

10:05.990 --> 10:08.830
- I like this guy.
- Of course you do.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.210
What's that supposed to mean?

10:10.220 --> 10:13.400
Charlie,he's a younger version of you.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.610
Oh yeah,that must be it.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.780
i'll get it.

10:17.790 --> 10:21.240
There you go.He could be a doorman.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.450
- Charlie,i really don't appreciate...
- I'm not saying right away.

10:23.460 --> 10:26.620
He could work his way up from doorstop.

10:26.630 --> 10:30.430
- Uncle charlie,it's chloe.
- Aw,geez,did you let her in?

10:30.440 --> 10:33.110
No,she's on the front porch.
I told her i'd see if you were home.

10:33.120 --> 10:37.810
Attaboy.See?
He'll make doorman in no time.

10:37.820 --> 10:41.310
- She brought soup.
- Why would she bring soup?

10:41.320 --> 10:44.800
You told her you had a bug.
So she assumed it was bronchial.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.910
If you'd been more specific,like i suggested,
you could have precluded this.

10:49.460 --> 10:53.550
Nobody just drops by when 
they think you have diarrhea.

10:55.690 --> 10:59.100
And i bet they don't bring soup either.

10:59.110 --> 11:02.360
All right,all right,i'm gonna sneak out
 the back door.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.680
Just tell her i had a doctor's appointment.

11:04.690 --> 11:07.850
Gp or specialist?

11:07.860 --> 11:12.700
Alan,i swear to god,i will rip off your head 
and use your neck as a bedpan.

11:13.060 --> 11:15.350
Charlie,you cannot keep lying
 to this girl forever.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.530
Oh,i think i can.

11:17.540 --> 11:22.200
Just go out there and tell her you're not 
interested in a relationship and be done with it.

11:22.830 --> 11:26.180
Yeah...I guess you're right.

11:26.190 --> 11:29.890
I say we eat the soup before you tell her.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.510
Smelled like minestrone.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.630
Listen,chloe,we need to talk...

11:38.680 --> 11:40.940
Chloe?

11:46.660 --> 11:49.780
- Looks like your problem's solved.
- Are you crazy?

11:49.790 --> 11:53.630
That rat bastard is stealing my girlfriend.

11:54.160 --> 11:57.830
Forget the girl,he's stealing our soup!

12:02.350 --> 12:05.070
Hey,baby,thanks so much for coming to see me.

12:05.080 --> 12:08.490
Yeah,well,that's what friends are for.

12:09.510 --> 12:14.880
So,um,charlie,did you know that fernando volunteers
 to build homeless shelters in his spare time?

12:14.890 --> 12:19.910
No,i didn't.Did you know his cousin steals wood?

12:20.410 --> 12:23.970
Really?That is fascinating.

12:23.980 --> 12:27.090
Why don't you come on inside,so we can visit.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.400
I'll see you later,fernando.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.190
Well,thank you for your thoughtful soup.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.500
It nourishes my body as your beauty
 nourishes my soul.

12:38.570 --> 12:41.050
Find something to saw.

12:42.150 --> 12:46.610
- So,chloe,what's new?
- Huh?Oh,nothing.

12:46.620 --> 12:51.290
- What is he,like,colombian?
- I don't know.

12:51.300 --> 12:54.690
But i gotta tell you,
i do feel much better seeing you.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.430
God,it's like his eyes are 
looking inside your soul.

12:59.410 --> 13:02.490
Yeah,kinda creepy.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.960
The way he speaks,it's so romantic.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.850
Hey,i almost forgot.

13:10.860 --> 13:13.200
- I wrote you a song.
- Really?

13:13.210 --> 13:18.020
Well,chloe,you've been on my mind a lot,
and i wanted to find a way to express my feelings.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.370
What's it called?

13:21.290 --> 13:23.840
chloe's song.

13:24.730 --> 13:28.100
I haven't put any words to it yet,
but it goes something like this.

14:02.710 --> 14:06.440
You should use those words.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.190
Thanks again for stopping by.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.350
- Yeah,i'm glad you're feeling better.
- So when am i gonna see you again?

14:19.360 --> 14:21.910
- Soon.
- How soon?

14:21.920 --> 14:24.970
I'll call you.
Bye,fernando.

14:24.980 --> 14:28.880
- Hasta luego,serita.
- oh,god...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.850
Call me.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.480
You have a beautiful lady,ser harper.

14:39.490 --> 14:43.290
- Thank you.
- She must make you feel...

14:43.300 --> 14:47.270
How do you say...Young again?

14:51.510 --> 14:55.450
Yeah.That's what i'm feeling.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.660
Hey,listen,charlie,i was thinking-- 
after fernando's done with the deck

15:00.670 --> 15:03.300
he could patch that hole in the roof 
where the squirrels get in.

15:03.310 --> 15:05.950
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

15:05.960 --> 15:08.470
I like squirrels.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.560
Hey,me too.

15:11.870 --> 15:15.230
But they get into the crawl space,
where they breed and die.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.880
That's what i like about 'em,alan.

15:19.510 --> 15:22.050
I like their little hands.

15:22.060 --> 15:26.250
- Come on,charlie,all fernando would have to do-
- forget fernando.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.270
I'm having second thoughts about him
even finishing the deck.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.950
- What,you want to fire him?
- I don't want to...

15:32.960 --> 15:35.250
I just don't think his work is very professional.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.230
I mean,he's wasting a lot of wood.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.090
And you know,wood doesn't just grow on tree...
He's gotta go.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.770
Charlie,you're not fooling anybody.
You're jealous.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.070
Jealous?

15:45.080 --> 15:49.600
You know what's cooler than squirrels?
Anteaters.They're just crazy-lookin'.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.000
I'm not jealous.

15:53.010 --> 15:56.490
And their name tells you what to feed 'em.

15:57.820 --> 15:59.500
Why would you say i'm jealous?

15:59.510 --> 16:01.990
I'm an omnivore.
That means i eat anything.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.030
Yeah,we've noticed.
Now shut up.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.550
I'm not jealous.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.750
Charlie,you want to fire this guy just 
because he's younger and better-looking than you.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.520
And he can sing.

16:11.530 --> 16:14.400
This has nothing to do with that.
And i can sing too.

16:14.410 --> 16:17.820
Yeah,but you stink.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.500
Hey,i'm done for the day.
I'll see you in the morning?

16:21.510 --> 16:24.830
Hold on,fernando.
I want to talk to you.

16:24.840 --> 16:27.760
Yes?

16:28.260 --> 16:32.300
- Never mind.Good night.
- Is there a problem?

16:32.310 --> 16:34.740
Because i want everything to be perfect for you.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.270
You're a good man and i respect you.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.940
You remind me of my sainted father.

16:41.590 --> 16:42.870
Thank you.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.570
He was wise and strong 
until syphilis made him crazy.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.600
Again,thanks.Good night.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.730
Buenas noches.

16:57.800 --> 17:02.060
I thought you were gonna get rid of him.
Or did you go crazy there for a second?

17:03.650 --> 17:06.660
I don't know,i just...
I just couldn't.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.579
Yeah,i think it's his eyes.

17:08.589 --> 17:11.020
It's like they're looking right into my soul.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.890
That's what mom said.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.050
Women used to say that about my eyes.

17:17.060 --> 17:20.560
Really?'Cause now they're kind 
of milky and bloodshot.

17:22.540 --> 17:25.980
Actually,the one on the right is 
starting to look a little lazy.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.569
You know,you're right.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.880
Okay,okay,that's enough.

17:30.890 --> 17:34.360
Come on,charlie,you can't expect to 
compete with a guy half your age.

17:34.370 --> 17:35.710
I am not competing.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.040
Well,you shouldn't,because it's perfectly natural.

17:38.050 --> 17:41.790
Each generation passes the torch on to the next.

17:41.800 --> 17:46.320
The child becomes the hunter,the hunter 
becomes the revered elder.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.210
When you're too old to chase the buffalo,

17:48.220 --> 17:51.860
it's time to stay back with the old women 
and make necklaces.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.530
Necklaces?

17:55.540 --> 18:00.570
Or weave blankets,tend the fire,
teach the kids to whittle...

18:02.120 --> 18:06.330
Buffaloes are cool,too.
They're like bad-ass cows.

18:15.770 --> 18:19.580
- Charlie...
- Yeah,hi.

18:19.590 --> 18:23.430
I was just in the neighborhood,
and i thought i'd drop off your soup thermos.

18:23.440 --> 18:27.680
Thanks.What did you do to yourself?

18:27.690 --> 18:28.930
Me?Nothing,nothing.

18:28.940 --> 18:33.080
I was just doing a little work outdoors,
got some sun.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.530
What's up with your teeth?

18:35.540 --> 18:39.080
Oh,i just brushed 'em real good.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.060
- So,can i come in?
- Oh,gee,charlie,i really...

18:44.420 --> 18:47.110
Wish you would've called.

18:47.370 --> 18:49.840
Ser harper...

18:53.720 --> 18:55.710
I was,how do you say...

18:55.720 --> 18:58.150
About to sleep with my girlfriend?

18:58.160 --> 19:01.160
Okay,about to.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.200
I am so sorry.

19:06.210 --> 19:09.070
I would understand if you fired me.

19:12.930 --> 19:15.410
Hey,it's no big deal,pal.

19:15.420 --> 19:17.510
This is the natural course of events.

19:17.520 --> 19:21.390
You're the next generation young,
vibrant,good-looking,

19:21.400 --> 19:23.520
you can buy chloe expensive jewelry...

19:23.530 --> 19:25.550
I cannot buy her expensive jewelry.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.780
Oh,right,that's me.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.840
What do you say,chloe-- want to go shopping?

19:31.850 --> 19:34.910
I'll go get my purse.

19:37.190 --> 19:40.150
And yeah,you're fired.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.500
Charlie,when are you coming back to bed?

19:50.510 --> 19:53.180
- Soon.
- How soon?

19:53.660 --> 19:55.880
I'll be right up,baby.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.750
Okay...Let me see if i got this right.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.640
You bought diamonds for the girl
 you were trying to get rid of 

20:06.650 --> 20:09.850
in order to win her from the handyman you fired.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.480
I'm sensing some judgement here.

20:13.470 --> 20:15.920
You're very astute.

20:16.310 --> 20:20.030
Okay,first of all,i got fernando another job.

20:20.040 --> 20:24.400
But the most important thing to remember is,i won.

20:25.300 --> 20:29.720
You're a lecherous old guy who bought a young 
woman's affection with shiny baubles.

20:29.990 --> 20:33.660
True.But i won.

20:38.830 --> 20:41.230
Are you sure we cannot open up a window?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.490
No,i like it hot.

20:49.240 --> 20:53.270
Okay,well,time for the victor to reap the spoils.

20:53.650 --> 20:55.970
Oh,charlie,aren't you ashamed?

20:55.980 --> 20:59.450
Alan,you know the difference between you and me?

21:12.290 --> 21:16.960
*****
