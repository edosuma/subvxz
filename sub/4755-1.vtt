03:34.420 --> 03:36.354
The heart...

03:44.330 --> 03:45.763
...for Smoke Frog.

03:45.832 --> 03:47.094
Thank you.

03:53.239 --> 03:55.298
This liver for Curl Nose.

03:55.642 --> 03:57.371
Thank you.

04:02.181 --> 04:03.443
Cocoa Leaf...

04:03.616 --> 04:04.776
...the ears.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.214
Thank you.

04:09.088 --> 04:10.646
And for you Blunted...

04:13.459 --> 04:15.051
...the balls.

04:18.363 --> 04:19.490
Not this again.

04:19.932 --> 04:20.921
I'm helping you.

04:21.134 --> 04:22.260
Then you eat them!

04:22.435 --> 04:24.767
I don't need them.
Neither do the rest of the fellows.

04:24.871 --> 04:25.895
Do you fellows?

04:25.972 --> 04:26.734
No.

04:26.806 --> 04:27.773
Of course not!

04:27.840 --> 04:29.102
Sometimes!

04:29.342 --> 04:30.138
What do you think?

04:30.510 --> 04:31.306
No!

04:31.377 --> 04:32.275
No, no!

04:32.879 --> 04:34.642
But how many times does it take?

04:34.881 --> 04:37.509
I have eight older sisters
and one brother.

04:37.850 --> 04:41.251
Father took tapir balls all ten times.

05:21.828 --> 05:23.193
Shall I tell him?

05:25.231 --> 05:27.529
I'm sorry. The balls are useless.

05:29.769 --> 05:30.963
You've never had them?

05:31.270 --> 05:33.738
Couldn't tell you what they taste like.

05:34.741 --> 05:35.833
None of you?

05:37.844 --> 05:40.506
No, but it's been fun watching you...

05:46.352 --> 05:47.376
This was your idea!

05:50.356 --> 05:51.653
Get him off me!

05:58.531 --> 06:00.158
Calm down!

06:17.617 --> 06:20.586
Why do you let them treat you like this?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.610
Be strong.

06:23.289 --> 06:24.688
Where is your pride?

06:29.729 --> 06:32.789
It all works... Yes?

06:36.235 --> 06:37.429
Yes...

06:37.970 --> 06:40.734
...I just can't make children.

06:46.179 --> 06:48.739
There is something I will tell you...

06:49.449 --> 06:52.714
...but I warn you, it's very powerful.

06:54.353 --> 06:55.149
What do you speak of?

06:55.955 --> 06:57.547
The soanzo leaf.

06:58.958 --> 07:00.323
The soanzo leaf?

07:00.593 --> 07:03.255
From the great marshes in the south...

07:08.100 --> 07:11.126
This is what gave me my ten children.

07:17.477 --> 07:19.672
No! No! Wait...

07:21.013 --> 07:23.345
You have to rub them on... down there.

07:24.050 --> 07:26.314
Just before you next try.

07:26.552 --> 07:28.611
Apply it generously...

07:33.226 --> 07:35.285
I don't know how to thank you.

07:37.296 --> 07:40.459
If this works...
maybe she'll stop bothering me.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.992
Your wife?

07:42.468 --> 07:44.299
No, her mother.

07:44.637 --> 07:47.037
The old hag wants grandchildren.

07:56.582 --> 07:58.140
Give me some meat.

07:58.651 --> 08:00.642
Here, work on this...

08:01.053 --> 08:02.884
...pure meat...

08:04.557 --> 08:06.889
...ball breath.

09:11.324 --> 09:12.450
What do you want?

09:16.896 --> 09:18.193
What do you want?

10:13.686 --> 10:18.851
I am Flint Sky. I have hunted
this forest from the day I came of age.

10:20.359 --> 10:24.762
My father hunted this forest
with me and before me.

10:26.399 --> 10:28.333
Jaguar Paw, my son.

10:28.634 --> 10:30.966
He hunts this forest with me.

10:32.505 --> 10:35.997
He will hunt it with his son
after I am gone.

10:56.162 --> 10:57.527
A good catch?

10:58.364 --> 11:00.332
Good waters here.

11:03.002 --> 11:04.469
The forest gives much here.

11:10.576 --> 11:12.510
We ask only to pass through.

11:13.379 --> 11:14.676
Pass.

11:20.553 --> 11:22.384
Keep safe as you pass.

11:26.025 --> 11:27.583
Let's go.

12:04.396 --> 12:06.557
Our lands were ravaged.

12:07.433 --> 12:09.367
We seek a new beginning.

12:16.342 --> 12:17.900
Your lands were ravaged?

12:21.647 --> 12:23.274
Yes...

12:24.583 --> 12:27.279
We seek a new beginning...

12:27.853 --> 12:29.115
Be still.

12:29.355 --> 12:30.287
My son!

12:32.291 --> 12:33.553
Be still.

12:38.697 --> 12:39.994
Back to the village.

13:13.732 --> 13:18.635
I ask you not to speak
of what you saw in the forest today.

13:22.541 --> 13:24.668
You are troubled.

13:24.910 --> 13:26.639
Yes, I am.

13:43.162 --> 13:47.292
Those people in the forest,
what did you see on them?

13:47.833 --> 13:48.993
I do not understand.

13:50.102 --> 13:51.569
Fear.

13:54.874 --> 13:57.843
Deep rotting fear.

13:58.410 --> 14:00.970
They were infected by it.

14:01.847 --> 14:03.144
Did you see?

14:03.682 --> 14:05.843
Fear is a sickness.

14:11.123 --> 14:15.253
It will crawl into the soul
of anyone who engages it.

14:17.062 --> 14:21.226
It has tainted your peace already.

14:23.435 --> 14:27.531
I did not raise you
to see you live with fear.

14:30.075 --> 14:31.770
Strike it from your heart.

14:31.977 --> 14:34.673
Do not bring it into our village.

14:35.214 --> 14:38.843
At first light
we will gather with the elders...

14:39.752 --> 14:42.880
...at the sacred hill of our fathers.

14:43.656 --> 14:47.922
There we will call on
their spirits to guide us.

14:59.104 --> 15:00.799
Oh, here he is!

15:01.774 --> 15:03.105
The big lump!

15:03.943 --> 15:05.410
He's useless.

15:06.111 --> 15:07.601
He can't do it.

15:09.415 --> 15:10.905
You! Yes you!

15:11.650 --> 15:15.051
With your height and your girth.
You have deceived us.

15:16.121 --> 15:17.383
Get inside!

15:22.928 --> 15:24.452
Damn you! Get in there!

15:24.797 --> 15:26.287
Old woman, please.

15:26.699 --> 15:27.666
Move it!

15:32.037 --> 15:33.504
You don't work!

15:36.041 --> 15:37.508
What are you laughing about?

15:45.484 --> 15:49.978
Give me a grandchild
or I will have you replaced.

15:51.156 --> 15:53.021
Mother, that's enough.

15:54.026 --> 15:57.120
Do not come out until you make a child.

15:58.797 --> 16:00.321
Two would be better!

16:00.566 --> 16:01.498
What?

16:03.168 --> 16:05.159
Twins you oaf.

16:13.912 --> 16:14.674
Mother.

16:15.647 --> 16:19.981
Can you go away?
He says he can't with you sitting there.

16:20.419 --> 16:21.784
Just get busy.

16:23.055 --> 16:24.352
Mom...

16:28.994 --> 16:30.461
She's gone.

17:14.039 --> 17:16.769
Mother, what do you say we should
have at the feast tonight?

17:17.041 --> 17:19.738
I have tapir...
but I also found this boy.

17:20.445 --> 17:21.174
I say boy.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.278
Roasted!

17:22.548 --> 17:25.175
The tapir smells better.
I think it's more fresh.

17:25.584 --> 17:27.518
No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!

17:27.719 --> 17:30.517
I'll just hang the boy here
in case we change our minds.

17:34.093 --> 17:34.787
Wait...

17:34.993 --> 17:37.860
That's our Turtles Run.
That's our eldest.

17:38.063 --> 17:40.531
Yes it's me. It's your eldest!

17:41.433 --> 17:44.732
In that case, a crush for my eldest...

17:48.340 --> 17:50.638
...and a crush for my youngest.

17:51.910 --> 17:54.242
Tapir it is.

19:00.345 --> 19:01.778
One day, old man!

19:02.347 --> 19:04.645
One day you won't be able
to run anymore!

19:22.367 --> 19:25.495
And a Man sat alone.

19:26.939 --> 19:29.464
Drenched deep in sadness.

19:30.175 --> 19:32.973
And all the animals
drew near to him and said:

19:33.612 --> 19:37.412
"We do not like to see you so sad...

19:39.218 --> 19:42.654
"Ask us for whatever you wish
and you shall have it."

19:43.689 --> 19:48.058
The Man said:
"I want to have good sight."

19:49.461 --> 19:52.658
The vulture replied:
"You shall have mine."

19:55.701 --> 19:58.898
The Man said: "I want to be strong."

20:02.608 --> 20:04.371
The jaguar said:

20:06.745 --> 20:09.680
"You shall be strong like me."

20:11.650 --> 20:17.520
Then the Man said: "I long
to know the secrets of the earth."

20:19.091 --> 20:24.051
The serpent replied:
"I will show them to you."

20:25.964 --> 20:28.455
And so it went with all the animals.

20:30.168 --> 20:32.898
And when the Man had
all the gifts that they could give...

20:33.105 --> 20:34.732
...he left.

20:36.308 --> 20:38.572
Then the owl said to the other animals:

20:39.511 --> 20:43.379
"Now the Man knows much
and is able to do many things...

20:44.483 --> 20:47.816
"Suddenly I am afraid."

20:51.023 --> 20:53.821
The deer said:
"The Man has all that he needs."

20:54.960 --> 20:56.951
"Now his sadness will stop."

20:57.596 --> 20:59.587
But the owl replied: "No."

21:02.267 --> 21:05.134
"I saw a hole in the Man...

21:06.138 --> 21:09.904
"Deep like a hunger
he will never fill...

21:10.942 --> 21:15.436
"It is what makes him sad
and what makes him want."

21:18.717 --> 21:21.777
"He will go on taking and taking...

21:22.988 --> 21:26.185
"Until one day the World will say:

21:26.958 --> 21:31.088
"I am no more
and I have nothing left to give."

22:17.843 --> 22:19.674
Come back to me...

22:24.015 --> 22:25.880
Come back to me.

22:54.780 --> 22:56.771
My son is dancing.

22:58.483 --> 23:00.610
Your son is happy.

23:53.004 --> 23:54.665
What do you want?

24:10.689 --> 24:12.418
Run!

24:27.973 --> 24:32.000
Now that you're up,
can you please kill that dog?

24:45.156 --> 24:47.215
The dog.

26:14.846 --> 26:16.438
Get up! Get up! Now!

27:32.190 --> 27:33.782
Go to the forest.

27:34.225 --> 27:36.056
Run! Do not look back.

28:01.853 --> 28:03.684
No! No! I am afraid!

28:04.055 --> 28:06.080
Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes.

28:06.424 --> 28:07.482
Be strong...

28:07.926 --> 28:09.018
I am afraid!

28:09.627 --> 28:11.151
Be strong.

29:09.587 --> 29:10.451
Tie him up!

30:28.600 --> 30:29.624
Father!

30:31.035 --> 30:33.196
The others. I have to help.

30:34.339 --> 30:36.068
No, don't leave us!

30:36.374 --> 30:39.036
I will come back, I promise.

30:39.344 --> 30:40.538
Don't you leave!

30:40.845 --> 30:41.675
I promise.

30:41.746 --> 30:42.644
Stay, please stay.

30:42.881 --> 30:44.007
Father, don't go.

31:40.638 --> 31:42.037
Very nice.

32:29.053 --> 32:30.077
Stop!

32:38.896 --> 32:40.193
Tie him up!

32:44.569 --> 32:45.968
I want him alive.

33:06.524 --> 33:07.786
Sorry Father.

33:26.911 --> 33:28.811
That's enough!

33:39.424 --> 33:41.187
Stand him up.

33:48.933 --> 33:50.560
Move away.

34:04.415 --> 34:06.178
My son.

34:17.061 --> 34:18.858
Don't be afraid.

35:17.188 --> 35:19.656
Almost...

35:34.572 --> 35:37.166
...that's your name.

35:38.176 --> 35:41.339
"Almost".

35:57.228 --> 35:59.696
Our life is over.

36:05.102 --> 36:06.399
Shame...

36:14.445 --> 36:15.673
Shame!

36:19.850 --> 36:21.909
Cowards!

39:55.599 --> 39:57.362
Let's move!

42:17.041 --> 42:18.406
We move out now.

42:18.809 --> 42:20.242
They are back.

42:23.280 --> 42:24.611
Get up!

42:27.418 --> 42:28.851
Heave!

42:36.060 --> 42:38.790
Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.

42:41.799 --> 42:43.096
Hold still.

42:52.810 --> 42:53.936
Can you see?

42:56.347 --> 42:57.279
Yes.

42:57.748 --> 42:59.545
Get back to your line.

44:00.978 --> 44:02.172
Come with us...

44:54.531 --> 44:55.725
Get up.

45:08.312 --> 45:10.576
Leave him alone, "Almost".

45:12.750 --> 45:14.615
I said get up.

45:43.180 --> 45:44.909
Up, up...

45:45.415 --> 45:46.973
...that's it.

45:49.119 --> 45:50.450
Let's go!

45:54.324 --> 45:57.225
This man is a good friend of yours...

46:32.129 --> 46:34.097
Don't worry...

46:37.668 --> 46:39.636
I'll take care of them.

46:42.573 --> 46:44.871
They are mine now.

46:52.149 --> 46:56.210
Gentle lxchel. Tender mother of mercy.

46:58.055 --> 47:03.186
Keep them from harm. Please. Keep them.

47:39.096 --> 47:40.688
One more.

48:04.321 --> 48:06.016
Ready?

49:06.950 --> 49:08.508
Hold on! Hold on!

49:12.456 --> 49:14.014
Wait...

49:15.559 --> 49:17.356
...let's see what happens.

49:25.369 --> 49:26.267
That's it!

49:33.510 --> 49:34.704
Hurry!

49:35.679 --> 49:37.613
Pull! Be strong!

49:56.666 --> 49:58.497
Yes! You did it!

50:02.372 --> 50:04.033
Good work!

50:16.853 --> 50:19.583
Can you breathe? Good.

50:49.386 --> 50:50.284
Wait here.

51:23.653 --> 51:25.314
What's become of my capture?

51:29.126 --> 51:30.559
Dead weight.

51:32.262 --> 51:34.492
He nearly took the rest with him.

51:36.766 --> 51:38.461
I let him go.

51:42.706 --> 51:44.435
You. Let him go?

51:51.515 --> 51:55.007
Shall we now do what you want?

51:59.356 --> 52:02.325
Let us try that.

52:25.582 --> 52:28.380
Don't let any others go.

52:35.058 --> 52:36.320
Let's move.

52:51.608 --> 52:53.735
Get up "Almost".

52:54.844 --> 52:58.405
We don't want to lose you just yet.

53:48.598 --> 53:50.589
Stand up, boy.

53:59.342 --> 54:01.867
You proved yourself today, my son.

54:02.579 --> 54:06.379
You're now worthy to stand
with the rest of us.

54:08.952 --> 54:11.477
Thank you Father.

54:21.531 --> 54:22.930
Take it...

54:23.667 --> 54:24.895
...it's yours.

54:29.005 --> 54:31.633
It has taken many lives.

54:44.020 --> 54:45.453
Get some rest.

54:59.969 --> 55:01.129
Resting brothers...

55:01.404 --> 55:04.771
...fathers, mothers, wives.

55:05.809 --> 55:09.973
You felt the cold
of this day's early morning.

55:10.914 --> 55:15.112
Now you cannot feel
the coldness of its night.

55:17.821 --> 55:19.812
She stopped screaming...

55:22.025 --> 55:24.994
...too long before they returned,
she had stopped screaming.

55:25.862 --> 55:28.524
We saw how she fought them.

55:29.566 --> 55:31.397
But in the final moment?

55:33.002 --> 55:34.902
If she let them...

55:37.574 --> 55:42.204
...the Goddess of the Scaffold
shows no mercy for the weakness...

55:44.247 --> 55:48.707
Her soul waits for yours
in the shade of the Ceiba Tree.

55:59.896 --> 56:01.591
I need to know.

56:03.099 --> 56:07.900
Before this day's end
I will leave this world.

56:09.806 --> 56:15.267
I will take as many
of these bastard dogs with me as I can.

56:17.614 --> 56:22.415
And I will gladly embrace
the torments of hell...

56:24.587 --> 56:27.954
...if I do not find my Sky Flower there.

56:34.998 --> 56:36.465
Don't rain.

57:19.809 --> 57:21.606
I am walking here.

57:54.410 --> 57:56.435
Keep away, she has the sickness.

58:22.038 --> 58:23.699
Get back!

59:16.593 --> 59:18.720
You fear me?

59:20.129 --> 59:22.723
So you should...

59:23.399 --> 59:26.800
...all you who are vile.

59:29.839 --> 59:33.366
Would you like to know how you will die?

59:40.416 --> 59:44.250
The sacred time is near...

59:46.422 --> 59:50.586
Beware the blackness of day.

59:53.796 --> 59:58.563
Beware the man who brings the jaguar.

01:00:01.471 --> 01:00:06.135
Behold him reborn from mud and earth...

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:13.080
For the one he takes you to
will cancel the sky...

01:00:14.217 --> 01:00:17.084
...and scratch out the earth.

01:00:18.221 --> 01:00:20.519
Scratch you out.

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:24.487
And end your world.

01:00:31.067 --> 01:00:34.195
He's with us now.

01:00:41.177 --> 01:00:44.010
...day will be like night.

01:00:44.547 --> 01:00:49.109
And the man jaguar
will lead you to your end.

01:02:00.089 --> 01:02:02.353
Where are they taking us?

01:02:06.662 --> 01:02:11.065
We tell stories of a place stone-built.

01:02:12.602 --> 01:02:14.126
What happens there?

01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:16.470
I do not know...

01:02:18.007 --> 01:02:21.534
...but the earth bleeds.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.480
We are near.

01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:09.783
Salvation!

01:03:10.393 --> 01:03:13.453
He has the laughing sickness.

01:03:14.463 --> 01:03:16.488
He likes you!

01:03:19.068 --> 01:03:20.296
Help me!

01:03:28.678 --> 01:03:30.509
Save me.

01:03:38.421 --> 01:03:39.979
Die like a man.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:21.675
Welcome back.

01:06:22.818 --> 01:06:24.285
Have you been successful?

01:06:24.887 --> 01:06:25.979
Ask my son.

01:06:27.923 --> 01:06:29.288
How many captives?

01:06:29.525 --> 01:06:30.492
Deal with my son.

01:06:32.595 --> 01:06:33.653
A fair price.

01:06:35.097 --> 01:06:36.860
As always, trust me.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:38.359
Good.

01:06:56.218 --> 01:06:58.914
How much will you give me?

01:08:00.649 --> 01:08:02.549
Who will buy this woman?

01:08:03.619 --> 01:08:04.984
No... she's too old.

01:08:06.322 --> 01:08:08.119
She can be useful.

01:08:08.624 --> 01:08:10.319
She can cook... clean...

01:08:11.861 --> 01:08:13.920
Useless old woman!

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.124
No sale.

01:08:24.874 --> 01:08:26.238
Go!

01:08:27.343 --> 01:08:28.604
Go on.

01:13:29.411 --> 01:13:33.711
These are the days of our great lament.

01:13:38.187 --> 01:13:40.087
The land thirsts.

01:13:42.524 --> 01:13:46.927
A great plague infests our crops.

01:13:49.765 --> 01:13:53.826
The scourge of sickness
afflicts us at whim.

01:13:59.842 --> 01:14:03.437
They say this strife has made us weak.

01:14:05.681 --> 01:14:07.512
That we have become empty.

01:14:10.319 --> 01:14:12.583
They say that we rot.

01:14:24.299 --> 01:14:27.166
Great people of the banner of the sun...

01:14:28.003 --> 01:14:29.470
I say...

01:14:30.672 --> 01:14:32.469
...we are strong.

01:14:36.979 --> 01:14:39.038
We are a people of destiny.

01:14:43.852 --> 01:14:47.117
Destined to be the masters of time.

01:14:51.193 --> 01:14:54.458
Destined to be nearest to the gods.

01:15:10.412 --> 01:15:13.540
Mighty Kukulkan!

01:15:15.183 --> 01:15:19.711
Whose fury could scorch
this earth to oblivion...

01:15:22.357 --> 01:15:24.655
Let us appease you with this sacrifice.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.057
To exalt you in your glory.

01:15:27.930 --> 01:15:30.524
To make our people prosper.

01:15:31.633 --> 01:15:34.363
To prepare for your return.

01:15:37.439 --> 01:15:40.203
Warrior, unafraid and willing!

01:15:40.776 --> 01:15:43.108
With your blood you renew the world!

01:15:43.645 --> 01:15:45.442
From age to age.

01:15:46.882 --> 01:15:48.509
Thanks be to you.

01:16:03.265 --> 01:16:05.426
The heart of god!

01:18:49.162 --> 01:18:51.426
Come back to me.

01:19:00.374 --> 01:19:02.239
Brother...

01:19:04.144 --> 01:19:05.941
Journey well...

01:19:08.115 --> 01:19:09.013
No.

01:19:10.517 --> 01:19:11.643
I can't go.

01:19:13.186 --> 01:19:14.744
Not now...

01:21:34.494 --> 01:21:39.329
People of the banner
of the sun do not fear.

01:21:40.267 --> 01:21:42.098
Rejoice!

01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:46.396
Kukulkan has drunk his fill of blood.

01:21:46.773 --> 01:21:49.571
We have sated his thirst.

01:21:50.711 --> 01:21:52.406
Great god.

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.610
Show us that you are pleased.

01:21:55.882 --> 01:21:59.477
Let your light return upon us.

01:23:04.851 --> 01:23:06.910
What of these captives?

01:23:11.625 --> 01:23:13.525
Dispose of them.

01:23:47.961 --> 01:23:50.122
I need a finisher.

01:23:55.168 --> 01:23:56.465
You.

01:24:02.576 --> 01:24:04.134
Release them.

01:24:12.419 --> 01:24:14.046
You watch.

01:24:34.941 --> 01:24:35.999
I'm ready!

01:24:41.014 --> 01:24:43.983
There's your jungle beyond the corn.

01:24:46.953 --> 01:24:48.352
Go to it.

01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:50.588
You're free...

01:24:52.459 --> 01:24:53.824
...now run.

01:24:57.163 --> 01:24:58.494
I said run.

01:25:02.903 --> 01:25:04.165
Run!

01:26:17.811 --> 01:26:18.903
Not bad.

01:26:37.063 --> 01:26:38.394
Your turn.

01:26:46.239 --> 01:26:47.763
Run.

01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.117
Run!

01:29:19.626 --> 01:29:21.184
Sleep.

01:29:22.162 --> 01:29:24.392
Sleep, sleep now my son.

01:29:25.465 --> 01:29:27.797
The pain will be no more.

01:29:29.769 --> 01:29:31.031
Sleep.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.247
He didn't come this way.

01:35:36.536 --> 01:35:38.504
He's in the trees.

01:35:40.273 --> 01:35:41.501
Spread out.

01:35:42.375 --> 01:35:43.899
Keep your eyes up.

01:36:06.299 --> 01:36:07.357
Quiet.

01:36:18.978 --> 01:36:20.172
He's coming right at us.

01:36:36.896 --> 01:36:37.555
There!

01:38:35.781 --> 01:38:38.511
He would have wanted me to have it.

01:38:40.686 --> 01:38:43.621
The omen is bad...

01:38:45.558 --> 01:38:48.618
Mighty Ek Chuah we beg you...

01:38:49.895 --> 01:38:54.127
Forgive us for this trespass
against your son the Jaguar.

01:38:56.135 --> 01:38:58.626
The omen is bad...

01:39:00.372 --> 01:39:02.340
Lift yourself up Drunkards Four...

01:39:03.209 --> 01:39:06.201
...the omen was foretold...

01:39:08.581 --> 01:39:11.778
...and now we have a fear more grave...

01:39:12.752 --> 01:39:16.153
...today I saw the day
become like night...

01:39:22.695 --> 01:39:26.324
I saw a man run with the Jaguar...

01:39:30.236 --> 01:39:34.332
...we must not let this man
make feet from us.

01:39:35.074 --> 01:39:36.234
Enough.

01:39:40.012 --> 01:39:41.877
Your words mean nothing.

01:39:43.249 --> 01:39:45.479
He runs because he is afraid.

01:39:46.852 --> 01:39:50.481
When I catch him,
I will peel his skin...

01:39:53.526 --> 01:39:56.256
...and have him watch me wear it.

01:40:03.969 --> 01:40:05.197
We leave now.

01:42:12.831 --> 01:42:14.025
Stay back.

01:43:24.970 --> 01:43:26.096
Here!

01:43:50.662 --> 01:43:52.789
The omen was bad...

01:43:56.502 --> 01:43:57.628
He's fucked.

01:44:00.939 --> 01:44:02.338
Help... please...

01:44:03.175 --> 01:44:04.437
Hanging Moss...

01:44:06.111 --> 01:44:07.738
See him out.

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:31.863
Open your veins. It's quicker.

01:44:44.583 --> 01:44:46.676
Travel well.

01:47:52.504 --> 01:47:55.234
So much for your prophecies.

01:48:01.113 --> 01:48:02.341
It's not over!

01:48:28.373 --> 01:48:30.000
I am Jaguar Paw...

01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:32.267
Son of Flint Sky...

01:48:33.712 --> 01:48:37.079
My father hunted
this forest before me...

01:48:38.817 --> 01:48:40.785
My name is Jaguar Paw.

01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:43.212
I am a hunter.

01:48:44.823 --> 01:48:47.087
This is my forest.

01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:52.788
And my sons will hunt it
with their sons after I am gone...

01:48:55.667 --> 01:48:56.895
Come on!

01:48:59.571 --> 01:49:01.266
We are going over.

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:04.570
We climb down around.

01:49:05.844 --> 01:49:07.937
We cannot let him get away.

01:49:08.647 --> 01:49:09.773
We cannot afford...

01:49:30.001 --> 01:49:32.128
We all jump.

01:52:29.147 --> 01:52:30.774
I am Jaguar Paw.

01:52:32.651 --> 01:52:34.482
This is my forest.

01:52:36.555 --> 01:52:39.251
And I am not afraid.

01:54:46.685 --> 01:54:49.245
You go. I'll wait here.

02:00:18.783 --> 02:00:20.580
Almost...

02:00:47.445 --> 02:00:50.141
Resting fathers, fly me your strength.

02:01:17.175 --> 02:01:18.938
Get up here.

02:01:33.825 --> 02:01:35.383
Go back!

02:02:04.789 --> 02:02:05.483
Quick!

02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:07.057
Hurry up!

02:08:33.911 --> 02:08:35.776
What are they?

02:08:37.448 --> 02:08:39.279
They bring men.

02:08:43.921 --> 02:08:45.821
Should we go to them?

02:08:54.131 --> 02:08:55.928
We should go to the forest.

02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:04.740
To seek a new beginning.

02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:11.313
Come Turtles Run...
