WEBVTT

00:08.876 --> 00:11.079
URKEL, WOULD YOU
HOLD STILL?

00:11.145 --> 00:13.547
I'VE GOT TO FINISH
THIS FOR ART CLASS.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.715
SORRY, EDDIE.

00:14.782 --> 00:19.087
I'M FLATTERED TO BE
THE MODEL FOR YOUR GREEK GOD.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.728
URKEL, WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU DOING?

00:27.795 --> 00:30.264
POSING AS A GREEK GOD.

00:30.331 --> 00:34.001
DOES SEEING ME LIKE THIS
GIVE YOU ANY IDEAS?

00:34.068 --> 00:35.669
ACTUALLY, IT DOES.

00:35.736 --> 00:39.373
MOM TOLD ME
TO GO TO THE MARKET...

00:39.440 --> 00:42.143
AND PICK UP A CHICKEN.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.887
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

00:53.954 --> 00:55.489
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

00:55.556 --> 00:58.792
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

00:58.859 --> 01:02.396
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:02.463 --> 01:05.599
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:06.967 --> 01:10.204
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:10.271 --> 01:12.840
* INSIDE
THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:14.375 --> 01:17.745
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:17.811 --> 01:21.182
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:22.750 --> 01:25.786
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:25.853 --> 01:29.857
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:29.923 --> 01:32.626
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:32.693 --> 01:36.297
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

01:36.364 --> 01:40.033
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:40.100 --> 01:43.371
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU,
ROOM FOR ME *

01:43.437 --> 01:47.408
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

01:47.475 --> 01:50.844
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:50.911 --> 01:54.415
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:07.127 --> 02:08.629
HI, EVERYBODY.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.130
HI, RODNEY.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.532
GREAT NEWS--

02:11.599 --> 02:14.802
EDDIE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE FRESHMAN CLASS.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.537
THAT'S GREAT.
CONGRATULATIONS, BABY.

02:16.604 --> 02:19.407
WAIT. I SAID
I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.743
EDDIE, DO IT.
YOU'VE GOT CHARISMA.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.178
YOU THINK SO?

02:24.245 --> 02:27.147
I USE
A DANDRUFF SHAMPOO.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.252
NO. I MEAN,
I THINK YOU COULD WIN.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.554
THE ONLY OTHER CANDIDATE
IS MARGIE FLEGMAN.

02:34.688 --> 02:38.326
I'M NOT SURE
IF POLITICS IS FOR ME.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.128
YOU KNOW, HONEY, THERE'S
SOMETHING VERY APPEALING

02:41.195 --> 02:42.896
ABOUT A MAN IN CHARGE.

02:42.963 --> 02:46.133
WOMEN ARE ALWAYS THROWING
THEMSELVES AT POLITICIANS.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.100
THEY ARE?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.369
SURE.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.671
WHY ELSE WOULD ANYONE
DATE HENRY KISSINGER?

02:53.307 --> 02:55.309
RODNEY, I'M RUNNING.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.444
IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO

02:56.510 --> 02:59.347
FOR ALL THE BABES
IN FRESHMAN CLASS.

03:10.624 --> 03:14.762
"5 x 2 IS 10.
5 x 3 IS 15.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.397
5 x 4 IS 20."

03:16.464 --> 03:18.699
CAN'T YOU
DO THAT SILENTLY?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.304
NO.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.141
THEN DO IT UPSTAIRS.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.479
ACTUALLY, THAT'S
NOT A BAD IDEA.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.681
I GUESS
SHE TOLD YOU.

03:35.283 --> 03:38.252
AND YOU GO HELP HER.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.589
HI, GUYS.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.523
HI.
HI.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.924
LOOK WHAT
I'M COLLECTING--

03:43.991 --> 03:45.693
EMPTY SODA CANS.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.928
WELL, EVERYBODY
NEEDS A HOBBY.

03:49.597 --> 03:50.831
NO, CARL.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.934
I'M RESEARCHING AN ARTICLE I'M
WRITING ON THE ENVIRONMENT.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.537
WE'RE DESTROYING
THE EARTH,

03:56.604 --> 03:59.373
SO I DECIDED TO DO MY PART
AND START RECYCLING.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.241
THAT'S A VERY
GOOD IDEA.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.910
ABSOLUTELY.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.879
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL CHIP IN
AND HELP SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.950
ARE YOU GOING OFF
THE DEEP END WITH THIS?

04:10.017 --> 04:13.287
OH, NO. I'M JUST
DOING RESEARCH FOR MY ARTICLE.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.023
I GOT IT
UNDER CONTROL.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.927
NO!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.698
WHAT?

04:24.765 --> 04:27.234
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

04:27.301 --> 04:30.471
I WAS TRYING TO SPRAY
WONDER WHIP ON MY PIE.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.406
THIS IS
IN AN AEROSOL CAN.

04:32.473 --> 04:36.109
THOSE FLUOROCARBONS
ARE DESTROYING THE OZONE LAYER.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.479
ALL I WANTED
WAS A SNACK.

04:38.546 --> 04:40.348
GO AHEAD.
EAT THE PIE.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.149
DESTROY THE WORLD.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.685
BOY! DO PEOPLE
WANT TO LEARN?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.987
NO. THEY WANT
TO EAT PIE.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.492
I'M GLAD SHE DIDN'T
GO OFF THE DEEP END.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.571
RODNEY, I'M GOING TO NEED
A BETTER SLOGAN

05:03.637 --> 05:06.139
THAN
"EDDIE FOR PRESIDENT."

05:06.206 --> 05:07.775
OKAY. OKAY, I'VE GOT IT.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.343
LISTEN TO THIS--

05:09.410 --> 05:12.480
"VOTE FOR EDDIE."

05:15.616 --> 05:18.552
WITH THAT SLOGAN
YOU'LL GET EXACTLY ONE VOTE--

05:18.619 --> 05:22.022
THAT IS, IF RODNEY
CAN MAKE AN "X."

05:22.089 --> 05:23.223
OH, YEAH?

05:23.290 --> 05:25.025
WHAT WOULD YOU
DO DIFFERENTLY?

05:25.092 --> 05:27.160
FIRST I'D FIND
A BETTER SLOGAN,

05:27.227 --> 05:29.296
SOMETHING LIKE...

05:29.363 --> 05:30.731
"WIN WITH WINSLOW."

05:30.798 --> 05:33.434
SEE, WITH "WIN"
ALREADY IN THE NAME,

05:33.501 --> 05:35.403
IT'S A NATURAL
CONNECTION.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.672
AND YOU WERE TRYING
TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF "SLOW."

05:43.477 --> 05:46.346
THEN I'D DEVELOP
A PLATFORM OF POPULAR IDEAS,

05:46.414 --> 05:47.815
THINGS LIKE, UM,

05:47.881 --> 05:52.085
LESS HOMEWORK, LONGER LUNCH
BREAKS, AND BIGGER LOCKERS.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.522
SO SHE'S GOT
GOOD IDEAS.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.625
I'VE GOT BUTTONS.

05:59.226 --> 06:02.530
WHO'S EDIE WINSLOW?

06:04.331 --> 06:06.400
NO. IT SAYS
"EDDIE WINSLOW."

06:06.467 --> 06:09.002
SINCE WHEN DO YOU SPELL
EDDIE WITH ONE "D"?

06:11.405 --> 06:14.408
SINCE WE GOT
1,000 OF THESE?

06:14.475 --> 06:17.611
YOU GOT 1,000 BUTTONS
THAT CALL ME EDIE?

06:18.446 --> 06:19.447
IT'S ALL
WE COULD AFFORD.

06:19.513 --> 06:22.382
THEY CHARGE
BY THE LETTER.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.418
LET ME LAY IT OUT.

06:24.485 --> 06:27.054
YOU'VE GOT
ONE CHANCE TO WIN.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.423
MAKE ME
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.091
I DON'T KNOW, LAURA.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.393
LET ME THINK ABOUT IT.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.429
OKAY, YOU'RE IN.

06:40.668 --> 06:44.204
OKAY, YOUR FIRST LESSON
OF THE DAY--

06:44.271 --> 06:45.673
THIS IS ALUMINUM.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.008
ALUMINUM
CAN BE RECYCLED.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.445
RECYCLING IS EASY AND GOOD
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.

06:51.512 --> 06:55.983
SEE? IT GOES
RIGHT IN HERE.

06:57.050 --> 06:57.951
THERE, NOW.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.187
CAN YOU SAY,
"ENVIROMENTALIST"?

07:03.857 --> 07:06.460
CAN YOU SAY,
"RECYCLE"?

07:09.863 --> 07:12.466
HOW ABOUT "MAMA"?
CAN YOU SAY "MAMA"?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.705
RACHEL, WHAT ARE
ALL THESE CANS?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.873
OH, I GOT US SET UP
FOR RECYCLING.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.941
WHEN THEY'RE FULL,

07:21.008 --> 07:23.176
THEY'LL GO TO THE
RECYCLING CENTER.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.712
I GOT STACKS
OF PAPER,

07:24.778 --> 07:29.116
CANS FOR PLASTIC,
CLEAR GLASS, COLORED GLASS,

07:29.182 --> 07:31.785
ALUMINUM,
AND OTHER METALS.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.154
WELL, WHAT'S
THIS ONE FOR?

07:35.923 --> 07:38.492
WHOA!

07:38.559 --> 07:40.628
WHAT IS IN THERE?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.830
THOSE ARE DIRTY DIAPERS.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.899
YOU WANT TO TAKE THOSE
OUT ON THE PORCH?

08:02.115 --> 08:05.485
HERE'S A COUPON FOR
A FREE SUSHI DINNER.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.557
YOU HATE RAW FISH.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.960
WE'LL GET IT TO GO,
BRING IT HOME, AND COOK IT.

08:17.698 --> 08:21.134
WOW, EDDIE,
YOU LOOK GREAT.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.871
MEET THE NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE FRESHMAN CLASS.

08:23.937 --> 08:27.107
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
AND GET THEIR VOTE?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.141
[DEEP VOICE]
HI, THERE.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.078
[DEEPER VOICE]
HI.

08:31.144 --> 08:33.313
I'M EDWARD WINSLOW,
AND I'M SEEKING YOUR VOTE

08:33.380 --> 08:34.582
FOR FRESHMAN CLASS
PRESIDENT.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.217
IF ELECTED, I PROMISE
TO SERVE THE STUDENTS

08:37.284 --> 08:39.653
TO THE BEST
OF MY ABILITY.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.089
I'D LIKE
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.992
IT'S MY MOTTO--
"WIN WITH WINSLOW."

08:45.058 --> 08:48.361
AND WITH YOUR SUPPORT,
WE CAN BOTH BE WINNERS.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.697
ALLOW ME.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.899
OW!

08:56.503 --> 08:58.005
SORRY, DAD.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.407
WELL, SON,
OTHER THAN BLEEDING,

09:00.473 --> 09:02.242
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.611
WAIT A MINUTE.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.745
HE FLASHED
YOU A SMILE

09:04.812 --> 09:06.647
AND STUCK YOU
WITH A BUTTON.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.917
IN BETWEEN
HE SAID NOTHING.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.184
GO GET HER.

09:16.223 --> 09:20.493
EXCUSE ME, BUT DIDN'T I
SEE YOU ON 227?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.696
GIVE ME A BREAK.

09:23.764 --> 09:25.365
I KNEW IT WAS
ONE OF THOSE SHOWS.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.867
ANYWAY...

09:29.269 --> 09:31.872
I JUST WANTED TO SAY
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE

09:31.939 --> 09:34.241
YOUR SUPPORT FOR
FRESHMAN CLASS PRESIDENT.

09:34.307 --> 09:36.677
AND DID I MENTION
WHAT A WONDERFUL OUTFIT THAT IS

09:37.878 --> 09:40.881
AND WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
SMILE YOU HAVE?

09:44.051 --> 09:45.753
HE'S GOOD!

09:48.188 --> 09:49.657
HE JUST MIGHT WIN.

09:49.723 --> 09:53.060
HE'S GOT MY VOTE.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.228
HEY, HONEY,

09:55.295 --> 09:57.564
HERE'S A TWO-FOR-ONE
COUPON TO THE MOVIES.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.232
IT'S ONLY GOOD
TILL 6 P.M.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.035
IF WE HURRY,
WE'LL MAKE IT.

10:02.102 --> 10:02.903
WHAT'S PLAYING?

10:02.970 --> 10:06.707
WHO CARES?
I'M GETTING IN FREE.

10:06.774 --> 10:07.875
GOODNIGHT, KIDS.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.811
BYE, MOM.
BYE, DAD.

10:10.878 --> 10:11.879
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
EDDIE.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.647
YOU'RE REALLY
DOING GREAT.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.548
THANKS.
AND WHO KNOWS?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.118
MAYBE I'LL BE
THE NEXT DAN QUAYLE.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.190
EDDIE, UM,
I DON'T THINK

10:23.256 --> 10:25.392
YOU WANT TO BE
SAYING THAT IN PUBLIC.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.996
ALRIGHT.

10:29.062 --> 10:29.863
WHAT NOW?

10:29.930 --> 10:32.565
WE LAY LOW
THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.534
IF WE CAN AVOID
BIG GROUPS

10:34.601 --> 10:36.336
AND BEING ASKED
LOTS OF QUESTIONS,

10:36.403 --> 10:38.038
WE'LL WIN.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.241
GUYS, GREAT NEWS--

10:41.308 --> 10:43.877
I ARRANGED A DEBATE
WITH MARGIE FLEGMAN TOMORROW

10:43.944 --> 10:46.313
IN FRONT
OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

10:46.379 --> 10:48.248
A DEBATE?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.183
WITH QUESTIONS?

10:50.250 --> 10:53.053
IN FRONT
OF PEOPLE?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.856
WELL, UNLESS WE FIND
A PICTURE OF MARGIE

10:55.923 --> 10:57.657
ON A YACHT
WITH GARY HART,

10:57.725 --> 10:59.927
WE'RE DEAD MEAT.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.974
LAURA, I THINK MURDER GOES
ON YOUR PERMANENT RECORD.

11:16.844 --> 11:19.212
I THOUGHT A DEBATE WOULD BE
GREAT EXPOSURE.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.615
IT'S JUST QUESTIONS FROM THE
EDITOR OF THE SCHOOL PAPER.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.351
OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

11:24.417 --> 11:25.685
WE'LL AVOID
THE ISSUES.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.354
FORGET ABOUT CONTENT.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.856
WE'LL USE
EMPTY PHRASES,

11:28.922 --> 11:31.391
LIKE, "I'M GLAD YOU ASKED
THAT QUESTION,

11:31.458 --> 11:34.361
BUT I WON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
UNTIL THE FACTS ARE IN."

11:34.427 --> 11:36.596
THAT'S GOOD.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.866
I COULD USE THAT
IN CLASS.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.834
GREAT. YOU TAKE CARE
OF EDDIE.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.035
I'M GOING TO DRAW
MUSTACHES

11:42.102 --> 11:44.237
ON MARGIE FLEGMAN'S
POSTERS.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.741
HI, RODNEY.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.209
HI, URKEL.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.945
WHAT'S THAT
ON YOUR SHIRT?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.947
WHERE?

11:54.014 --> 11:55.415
OW!

11:58.485 --> 11:59.987
HEH! HEH! HEH! HEH!

12:00.053 --> 12:03.190
YOU GOT TO TEACH ME
THAT TRICK SOMEDAY.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.925
YEAH. RIGHT.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.260
[SNORT]

12:11.865 --> 12:14.234
HI, LAURA.

12:14.301 --> 12:17.670
MY, YOU LOOK LOVELY
THIS EVENING.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.173
I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.274
GO HOME.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.109
I CAN'T.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.710
IT'S MY PARENTS'
BRIDGE NIGHT,

12:23.777 --> 12:25.913
AND I'M NOT ALLOWED
NEAR THEIR FRIENDS.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.285
OKAY. YOU CAN STAY,

12:32.352 --> 12:33.954
BUT JUST DON'T
SAY ANYTHING.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.223
I PROMISE.
NOT A WORD.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.860
OKAY.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.795
NOW, THE KEY TO
WINNING THIS DEBATE IS--

12:41.862 --> 12:44.131
[HUMMING]

12:46.533 --> 12:48.268
URKEL.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.402
STOP HUMMING.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.138
WAS THAT ME?

12:53.907 --> 12:55.876
CAN WE PLEASE GET BACK
TO MY ELECTION?

12:55.943 --> 12:58.778
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.580
YOU'RE RUNNING
FOR FROSH PREZ

13:00.647 --> 13:02.449
AGAINST
MARGIE FLEGMAN.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.852
SAY HI
TO HER FOR ME.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.219
YOU KNOW HER?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.520
WHY, SURE.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.989
WE GO TO THE SAME
EYE DOCTOR,

13:09.056 --> 13:11.424
DERMATOLOGIST,
AND ALLERGIST.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.930
SHE'S A REAL NERD.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.800
YOU'RE CALLING HER
A NERD?

13:20.868 --> 13:21.869
WHY, SURE.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.037
I MEAN,
SHE'S NICE AND ALL,

13:24.104 --> 13:26.907
BUT SOCIALLY,
SHE'S A REAL DUD.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.312
URKEL, YOU JUST
GAVE ME AN IDEA.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.882
DOES IT INVOLVE
YOU AND ME ALONE

13:34.948 --> 13:37.584
ON A DESERT ISLAND?

13:41.121 --> 13:43.323
STEVE, IT'S
THAT TIME AGAIN.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.993
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, YOU'VE
OVERSTAYED YOUR WELCOME.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.695
DID I SAY SOMETHING?
DID I BELCH?

13:48.761 --> 13:51.965
I DO THINGS
UNCONSCIOUSLY SOMETIMES.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.368
GOODBYE, STEVE.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.441
THANK YOU FOR
A LOVELY EVENING.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.964
WELL, EDDIE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.467
JUST REMEMBER, SMILE
AND AVOID THE ISSUES.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.436
IN OTHER WORDS,
ACT LIKE A PRESIDENT.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.503
GOT IT.

14:30.570 --> 14:35.408
ATTENTION. EVERYBODY
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.910
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

14:36.977 --> 14:38.778
AS YOUR STUDENT
COUNCIL PRESIDENT,

14:38.845 --> 14:40.480
I WELCOME YOU
TO THE DEBATE

14:40.547 --> 14:43.816
BETWEEN THE FRESHMAN CLASS
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.986
MARGIE FLEGMAN,
EDWARD WINSLOW,

14:46.053 --> 14:48.421
PLEASE TAKE
YOUR POSITIONS.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.958
THE MODERATOR
WILL BE REBECCA SANDLER,

14:51.024 --> 14:52.926
EDITOR OF
THE MONTHLY BEACON.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.228
THANK YOU.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.599
HEY, LAURA.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.769
THE SPONTANEOUS
DEMONSTRATIONS

15:02.835 --> 15:05.405
ARE ALL PLANNED.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.074
GREAT.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.142
OUR FIRST QUESTION
WILL GO TO EDDIE WINSLOW.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.143
EDDIE,

15:10.210 --> 15:12.179
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT SCHOOL ACTIVITIES

15:12.245 --> 15:14.881
THAT HELP THE COMMUNITY?

15:14.948 --> 15:16.283
YOU TALKING TO ME?

15:16.349 --> 15:17.750
YES.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.886
OH. UM,

15:19.953 --> 15:22.022
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU ASKED
ME THAT QUESTION.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.757
I'VE FORMED A COMMITTEE
TO LOOK INTO THAT.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.426
I'LL ISSUE
A FULL STATEMENT

15:26.493 --> 15:29.662
AS SOON AS I READ
THEIR REPORT.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.797
ALRIGHT!

15:30.863 --> 15:33.500
WINSLOW! WINSLOW!
WINSLOW! WINSLOW!

15:33.566 --> 15:34.701
[GAVEL POUNDS]

15:34.767 --> 15:38.838
PEOPLE, PEOPLE,
PEOPLE...

15:38.905 --> 15:39.872
THANK YOU.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.010
UH, MARGIE,
THE SAME QUESTION.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.113
IS THIS OFF?

15:49.049 --> 15:51.618
I WAS THINKING
OUR SCHOOL COULD TRY

15:51.684 --> 15:55.222
TO COEXIST HAND IN HAND
WITH OUR COMMUNITY,

15:55.288 --> 15:57.424
BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN
DOING ENOUGH.

15:57.490 --> 16:01.161
LAST YEAR, WE HAD ONE
FOOD AND CLOTHING DRIVE.

16:01.228 --> 16:04.564
MAYBE WE COULD HAVE
TWO EACH SEMESTER.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.798
WE REALLY SHOULD HELP

16:05.865 --> 16:07.134
THOSE WHO ARE
LESS FORTUNATE.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.103
BOO! SIT DOWN,
FLEGMAN!

16:12.205 --> 16:14.074
EDDIE, WHAT STEPS
WOULD YOU TAKE

16:14.141 --> 16:17.510
TO IMPROVE OUR SCHOOL'S
ACADEMIC AVERAGE?

16:17.577 --> 16:18.478
WELL,

16:18.545 --> 16:21.348
BEFORE I BEGIN, REBECCA,
I WANT TO SAY

16:21.414 --> 16:23.516
THAT'S A LOVELY DRESS
YOU'RE WEARING.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.885
OH, THANK YOU.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.354
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.622
I WANT THE BEST
FOR MY FELLOW STUDENTS,

16:29.689 --> 16:32.259
AND I'M PROUD
TO BE AN AMERICAN.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.262
EDDIE! EDDIE!
EDDIE! EDDIE!

16:36.029 --> 16:38.465
[GAVEL POUNDS]

16:38.531 --> 16:39.532
THANK YOU.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.468
THANK YOU!

16:41.534 --> 16:43.670
LET'S GIVE MARGIE
EQUAL TIME.

16:43.736 --> 16:45.672
BOO!

16:45.738 --> 16:48.475
MARGIE,
THE SAME QUESTION.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.677
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THE STRONGER STUDENTS

16:50.743 --> 16:52.812
TUTORING THOSE
WHO NEED SOME HELP.

16:52.879 --> 16:56.283
WE COULD KEEP THE LIBRARY
OPEN LONGER HOURS.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.118
EVERYONE WILL HAVE
TO PUT IN

16:58.185 --> 16:59.319
A LOT OF HARD WORK.

16:59.386 --> 17:03.022
NO WORK! NO WORK!
NO WORK! NO WORK!

17:03.090 --> 17:06.293
NO WORK! NO WORK!
NO WORK! NO WORK...

17:11.531 --> 17:14.901
HARRIETTE, WHAT IS
GOING ON IN HERE?

17:14.967 --> 17:16.269
I DON'T KNOW.

17:16.336 --> 17:20.006
I THINK THERE USED TO BE
A KITCHEN HERE SOMEWHERE.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.275
I NEED AN ASPIRIN.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.477
THERE'S SOME
IN THE PANTRY, BABY.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.494
WHERE IN THE PANTRY?

17:46.999 --> 17:48.668
HI, GUYS.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.069
RACHEL,

17:50.137 --> 17:51.338
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:51.404 --> 17:54.341
THIS PLACE LOOKS LIKE
A RECYCLING CENTER.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.277
IT IS
A RECYCLING CENTER.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.850
WHY?

18:06.052 --> 18:08.155
WELL, THERE WASN'T
ONE AROUND HERE.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.158
RACHEL, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THIS.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.926
I GUESS I DID GO OVERBOARD
A LITTLE BIT.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.462
LITTLE BIT?

18:15.528 --> 18:19.065
I NEARLY GOT A CONCUSSION
TRYING TO GET AN ASPIRIN.

18:19.132 --> 18:20.600
LOOK, RACHEL,

18:20.667 --> 18:23.170
WE BELIEVE IN DOING
WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO

18:23.236 --> 18:24.571
TO SAVE OUR PLANET,

18:24.637 --> 18:29.008
BUT THIS BELONGS IN A PARKING
LOT, NOT OUR KITCHEN.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.410
I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING

18:30.477 --> 18:32.345
TO HELP WITH
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.047
RACHEL, YOU ARE
DOING SOMETHING.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.283
THAT ARTICLE
YOU'RE WRITING

18:36.349 --> 18:38.985
WILL INSPIRE A LOT
OF PEOPLE TO RECYCLE.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.421
WE'LL CONTINUE
TO RECYCLE, TOO,

18:41.488 --> 18:43.089
BUT WE'LL DO IT
REASONABLY.

18:43.156 --> 18:47.460
NO ONE COULD STICK
TO THE PLAN YOU SET UP.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.629
I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.298
LOOK,

18:51.364 --> 18:54.033
I'M SORRY I JUMPED OFF
THE DEEP END...

18:54.100 --> 18:56.336
AGAIN.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.205
YOU WRITE
A GOOD ARTICLE,

18:58.271 --> 19:00.173
AND WE'LL
FORGET ABOUT IT.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.209
OKAY. I'M GOING TO CHECK
ON LITTLE RICHIE.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.944
THEN I'LL COME DOWN
AND CLEAN THIS UP.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.779
OKAY.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.161
HOW DID YOUR PARENTS EVER
SURVIVE HER WONDER YEARS?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.803
WE CAN ALSO IMPROVE
STUDENT/FACULTY RELATIONS

19:30.870 --> 19:33.206
WITH SMALL
AND INFORMAL DINNERS.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.774
NOT BAD.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.511
EDDIE, HOW WOULD YOU IMPROVE
STUDENT/FACULTY RELATIONS?

19:38.578 --> 19:40.012
OOH...

19:40.079 --> 19:41.948
THAT'S
A TOUGH QUESTION.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.016
AND I DON'T...

19:44.083 --> 19:45.385
HAVE ANY IDEA,

19:45.452 --> 19:47.687
BUT I LIKED
WHAT MARGIE SAID.

19:47.754 --> 19:51.558
EDDIE! EDDIE!
EDDIE! EDDIE!

19:52.825 --> 19:55.862
PEOPLE, WE ONLY HAVE
THE GYM FOR ONE HOUR.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.466
MARGIE, A LEADER
MUST BE ABLE

19:59.532 --> 20:01.000
TO WORK WELL
WITH OTHERS.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.770
DO YOU HAVE
THIS QUALITY?

20:03.836 --> 20:04.737
I DO HAVE THE ABILITY

20:04.804 --> 20:06.873
TO WORK WELL
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

20:06.939 --> 20:09.342
NERD! NERD! NERD!

20:09.409 --> 20:12.445
MY BEING RECORDING SECRETARY
FOR THE CHESS CLUB

20:12.512 --> 20:14.814
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS
PROVES THAT FACT.

20:14.881 --> 20:18.685
NERD! NERD!
NERD! NERD!

20:18.751 --> 20:20.853
I AM WHO I AM...

20:20.920 --> 20:23.823
I'LL DO THE BEST
I CAN.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.825
HEY!

20:25.892 --> 20:28.395
HEY, COME ON!
BE QUIET!

20:29.629 --> 20:30.563
YOU GUYS HAVEN'T
BEEN LISTENING

20:30.630 --> 20:33.300
TO WHAT MARGIE'S
BEEN SAYING.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.134
SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S ORGANIZED,

20:35.201 --> 20:37.437
AND SHE'LL
GET THINGS DONE.

20:37.504 --> 20:39.872
I'M ONLY DOING THIS
TO GET GIRLS.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.809
I LOVE YOU, EDDIE!

20:45.044 --> 20:46.178
BUT YOU'RE TREATING THIS

20:46.245 --> 20:48.180
LIKE IT'S
A POPULARITY CONTEST.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.450
THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT SHOULD BE.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.085
YOU SHOULD ELECT THE PERSON
WITH THE BEST IDEAS,

20:53.152 --> 20:56.689
NOT THE BEST LOOKS.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.358
SORRY, MARGIE.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.930
IN FACT, TO MAKE THINGS
EASY FOR YOU,

21:03.996 --> 21:06.633
I'M DROPPING OUT.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.870
IF YOU'RE SMART,
YOU'LL VOTE FOR MARGIE.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.640
I KNOW I WILL.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.028
LAURA, CAN WE TALK?

21:39.198 --> 21:41.434
WHAT IS THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

21:41.501 --> 21:43.370
YOU HAD IT ALL
LOCKED UP.

21:43.436 --> 21:46.305
THE CROWD
WAS WITH YOU.

21:46.373 --> 21:50.042
I JUST DECIDED WHAT
I WAS DOING WAS WRONG.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.611
I COULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.880
EDDIE, YOU
WOULD HAVE WON.

21:53.946 --> 21:56.783
ISN'T THAT THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING?

21:56.849 --> 21:59.619
NOT WHEN IT'S BASED
ON DIRTY TRICKS.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.789
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
YOU KNOW IT'S WRONG, TOO.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.459
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
THAT BAD.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.295
COME ON, ADMIT IT.

22:09.362 --> 22:12.365
YOU GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE POWER OF POLITICS.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.101
MAYBE THERE WERE
A FEW THINGS

22:15.167 --> 22:17.604
I COULD HAVE DONE
DIFFERENTLY.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.838
LAURA,

22:18.905 --> 22:20.707
A FEW THINGS?

22:20.773 --> 22:24.444
OKAY, OKAY,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.679
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

22:26.746 --> 22:30.049
I JUST WANTED
TO WIN SO BADLY.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.351
THERE ARE SOME THINGS

22:32.419 --> 22:35.287
THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN WINNING.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.024
I KNOW.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.260
I'M SORRY I GOT YOU INVOLVED
IN ALL THAT STUFF.

22:41.327 --> 22:44.163
I WAS WRONG.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.665
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.267
MARGIE WILL MAKE
A BETTER PRESIDENT.

22:48.334 --> 22:51.370
OH, YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.

22:51.438 --> 22:54.073
YOU COULD HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT IT FOR A SECOND.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.643
SORRY.

22:56.709 --> 22:57.577
WELL,

22:57.644 --> 23:01.113
I GUESS I WON'T
BE NEEDING THESE.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.148
I'LL JUST
PUT THEM AWAY

23:02.214 --> 23:06.519
UNTIL YOU GET
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.829
AUNT RACHEL!
