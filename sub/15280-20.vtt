WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:10.489
Scotch.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.201
That's what we're missing.

00:13.210 --> 00:20.070
The smooth, smoky flavor of a single
barrel scotch, juicy porterhouse.

00:27.330 --> 00:29.537
I was really hoping
you would get your appetite back.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.374
You're going to need to eat.
You're going to need your strength.

00:52.460 --> 00:56.373
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

00:57.620 --> 00:58.609
What?

00:59.460 --> 01:01.451
We've only been here an hour.
You've made two calls.

01:01.460 --> 01:02.529
And?

01:02.540 --> 01:05.247
-You hate the phone, Elle.
-I don't hate the phone.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.660
Actually, you do.

01:06.670 --> 01:08.877
Hey, did you know that
Alexander Graham Bell and Eli Gray

01:08.880 --> 01:11.576
both simultaneously invented
electronic sound transmission devices?

01:11.580 --> 01:13.741
It came down to a race betwixt the two.

01:13.750 --> 01:17.322
Yeah, and Bell beat Gray to
the patent office by a matter of hours.

01:18.380 --> 01:19.699
Common knowledge.

01:20.290 --> 01:21.951
Why are you acting so weird?

01:23.290 --> 01:26.612
We're sitting with a guy who knows
that there are 800 kernels of corn

01:26.620 --> 01:29.418
-on the average cob...
-Arranged in 16 separate rows.

01:29.420 --> 01:31.570
And you're calling me weird?

01:31.580 --> 01:33.992
You're getting some loving, aren't you?
You got a boyfriend.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.161
You are basing this on what, exactly

01:36.170 --> 01:38.377
That's all you've got

01:38.380 --> 01:41.247
You've been a profiler for how long,
Derek, and that is... That's weak.

01:41.250 --> 01:42.956
-That's weak.
-What's weak?

01:42.960 --> 01:44.746
-Morgan thinks Elle has a boyfriend.
-Nothing.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.116
-"Nothing." See, you just denied it.
-Do you?

01:47.120 --> 01:48.417
It's more fun not to answer that question.

01:48.420 --> 01:51.742
That right there's a yes, baby.
I knew it. I told you.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.160
She didn't really admit to anything, man.

01:53.170 --> 01:56.207
-Thank you.
-Reid, trust me, you got a lot to learn.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.826
FBI Tampa has been investigating
a series of murders

01:58.830 --> 02:01.412
over the past two months along
Florida's central Gulf coast.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.911
I consulted with the SAC down there.
They had a strong lead.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.410
And DNA evidence.

02:05.420 --> 02:09.038
All four women were killed by this man,
Mark Gregory.

02:09.040 --> 02:11.873
Wait. If they know who he is,
he's not really an UnSub.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.245
Why are they calling us?

02:13.250 --> 02:15.741
They were unable to arrest him before
he disappeared.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.913
They let a serial killer get away

02:18.920 --> 02:23.072
About 36 hours, along with
this woman, Nicole Wegener.

02:23.620 --> 02:25.201
What do we know about the other victims?

02:25.210 --> 02:28.702
They were all abducted
within a 60-mile radius,

02:28.710 --> 02:31.611
tortured and then drowned
in hotel bathtubs.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.668
They were all found a couple of days
after they were reported missing.

02:35.670 --> 02:36.876
Same geographical area

02:36.880 --> 02:39.667
and he's killing in hotels instead of
private, controlled environments.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.991
Well, he can pay for
privacy in a hotel room.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.911
Let's just hope
he's not heading for Orlando.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.320
It's second only to Las Vegas
in the number of hotel rooms.

02:46.620 --> 02:48.872
Well, knowing who he is,
is certainly part of the equation,

02:48.880 --> 02:50.871
but it's a long way
from knowing where he is.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.825
A serial killer_who's been sussed out
and IS on the loose,

02:52.830 --> 02:54.377
he's got two choices.

02:54.380 --> 02:56.996
He's either hiding or worse,
he's on the run.

02:57.620 --> 02:59.781
And if Gregory feels like he's got
nothing to lose...

02:59.790 --> 03:01.530
He's got the whole country ahead of him.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.492
The French philosopher
Voltaire wrote,

03:42.500 --> 03:44.707
"There are some that only employ words

03:44.710 --> 03:47.201
"for the purpose of disguising
their thoughts."

03:47.710 --> 03:50.918
All right, this is everything
the Tampa office has on Mark Gregory.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.037
He's a single, white male, 38 years old.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.917
Graduated from FSU.,

03:55.920 --> 03:59.913
Started his own real estate company
with a business partner five years ago.

03:59.920 --> 04:04.414
He frequently travels for work around
the country, sometimes overseas.

04:04.420 --> 04:08.618
Just last year he purchased
a very lavish home in Sarasota.

04:08.620 --> 04:10.247
What was he doing
before he got into real estate?

04:10.250 --> 04:13.538
Says he raced cars after college,

04:13.540 --> 04:15.576
even worked as a chef
at a French restaurant.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.162
Yeah, he's plenty mastered.

04:18.920 --> 04:21.320
He worked as a staff photographer
for a couple of magazines

04:21.330 --> 04:23.491
along the Central Coast
before transitioning to work

04:23.500 --> 04:24.990
with models in Miami.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.709
It's strange so many serial killers
make a hobby of photography.

04:28.710 --> 04:30.871
Must have something to do with
the act of voyeurism.

04:31.330 --> 04:32.911
What about his bank accounts
and credit cards?

04:33.330 --> 04:36.288
They seized everything after
he disappeared 36 hours ago.

04:36.290 --> 04:37.996
So when he uses his credit cards

04:38.000 --> 04:40.742
or goes to his house or work,
then they've got him.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.991
I heard enough about Mark Gregory.
I want to hear about his victims.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.826
Gregory used different forms
of torture with each one.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.240
F.B.I. Temporary Command Center
SARASOTA, FLORIDA

04:47.250 --> 04:49.241
Choking, burning, suspension, and beating.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.569
Drowning was the only constant.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.457
They were all classified as wet drownings,

04:52.460 --> 04:55.702
which means the victim was alive
when they were submerged.

04:55.710 --> 04:58.531
They could feel their lungs
filling up with water.

04:58.540 --> 05:02.249
-It's an extremely painful way to die.
-Why would he take the time?

05:02.250 --> 05:04.457
They were barely alive
after all the torture.

05:04.460 --> 05:08.328
Well, drowning's a form of torture,
too, and it's all part of his signature.

05:08.330 --> 05:09.957
SSA Raymond McCarthy.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.076
SSA Jason Gideon, we spoke on the phone.

05:12.080 --> 05:13.490
Sorry for the temporary setup.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.912
We wanted you closer to where
Mark Gregory lives.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.035
Please, continue.

05:17.290 --> 05:20.327
Oh, we were just discussing drowning
as a cleansing ritual.

05:20.330 --> 05:21.820
If we look back into Gregory's childhood,

05:21.830 --> 05:23.661
we may find what he needs to purge.

05:23.670 --> 05:25.285
You think that's the best use of our time?

05:25.290 --> 05:27.201
We're itching to find this guy.
He got away on our watch.

05:27.210 --> 05:29.075
Well, by studying
his behavior as a child,

05:29.080 --> 05:31.071
it helps us understand why
he does what he does.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.822
You know everything about this killer,
except why he does it.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.879
So, the further we go back,
the further ahead of him we might get.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.916
Were you able to connect Gregory
to all four victims?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.457
He had a previous relationship
with the first woman he killed.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.325
Oh, we can look into that
as the possible stressor.

05:43.330 --> 05:45.457
The second and third were
acquaintances from busnness deals.

05:45.460 --> 05:47.416
The fourth worked at a restaurant
the same time he did.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.320
What's his connection to the missing girl?

05:49.330 --> 05:52.322
We can't find anything.
Gregory's big news in Florida.

05:52.330 --> 05:54.958
When do we hold a press conference
to alert the entire country?

05:54.960 --> 05:57.747
Hopefully we'll find Gregory
before we have to.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.537
So, if we split up,
we'll cover more ground.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.576
Does he still have family in the area?

06:02.580 --> 06:04.116
His dad's close by.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.953
Why don't we start from the present
and work our way backwards?

06:07.670 --> 06:09.615
Reid and I will go to Gregory's house.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.373
Elle and I will go and talk with the
business partner, Hank Bloomberg.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.075
I'll comb through
some of the evidence here.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.162
Garcia's going to want an update.
I'll catch up with her.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.614
Good,
let's meet back here in two hours.

06:17.620 --> 06:19.872
If he's following a previous pattern,
we have less than 12 hours

06:19.880 --> 06:21.245
to find Nicole Wegener alive.

06:21.580 --> 06:22.740
Mark Gregory's Office
SARASOTA, FLORIDA

06:22.750 --> 06:23.819
Mr. Bloomberg?
-Yes.

06:23.830 --> 06:25.821
Agents Hotchner and Greenaway, FBI.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.377
Well, I've already talked to the police.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.075
We're from the Behavioral Analysis Unit,

06:29.080 --> 06:30.991
and I'm sure we'll have
some different questions.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.116
We're looking for some insight
into Mark Gregory's behavior

06:33.120 --> 06:34.826
right before the killings started.

06:34.830 --> 06:37.378
Things you might not think are important
could actually be helpful.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.996
Well, I don't know why he disappeared.
You're sure you got the right guy?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.458
Usually when someone takes off,
it gives us reason to be suspicious.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.207
Well, I've never noticed any odd behavior.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.917
We've worked together for five years.
I've known him for 10.

06:50.790 --> 06:54.112
He helped coach
my son's soccer league this past fall.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.246
He's my best friend.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.956
What about his relationship with women?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.706
Mark's a consummate ladies' man.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.075
He always had a different woman
on his arm.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.072
-Never had a problem getting a date.
-Yes, well, dating doesn't do it for him.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.991
He likes to torture and drown them.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.611
What do you know about his history
with women?

07:09.290 --> 07:12.111
He was married once in his early 205.
Swore he'd never do it again.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.496
Did you know her?

07:13.920 --> 07:15.740
No, it was before I met him.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.286
Do you know if she's still in the area?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.110
Wait a minute.
You think he did something to his ex-wife?

07:22.120 --> 07:24.702
We're looking for what we call a stressor,

07:24.710 --> 07:26.917
what could have made him lose it.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.320
We have to look into
all the possibilities.

07:29.330 --> 07:31.537
If we need to ask you
any more questions, we'll find you.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.160
Thank you.

07:36.380 --> 07:38.200
I bet Gregory's been killing
a lot longer than we think,

07:38.210 --> 07:39.245
long before he disappeared.

07:42.380 --> 07:45.076
This is a really large house
with hardly any furniture.

07:45.080 --> 07:51.417
Typical bachelor pad.
Large sofa, big-screen TV, white walls.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.829
I noticed a luxury car in the garage,
but it's at least 10 years old.

07:55.830 --> 07:57.286
Where are the dogs?

08:02.540 --> 08:04.280
Gideon, check this out.

08:05.250 --> 08:08.242
This guy's got, like, 20 different suits.

08:08.830 --> 08:12.789
Some Italian, some tailored,
some leisure suits.

08:14.380 --> 08:15.950
He's got a mechanic's uniform.

08:18.210 --> 08:20.952
Wide assortment of watches and wallets,

08:20.960 --> 08:23.417
approximately 20 different pairs of shoes.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.911
Look at all these driver's licenses.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.742
He could start his own DMV.
Feed those to Garcia.

08:31.420 --> 08:35.993
He travels around the country
to buy and sell different properties.

08:36.620 --> 08:39.282
Probably reinvents himself with each
deal he makes. You know?

08:39.290 --> 08:41.451
Plays a different role.

08:41.960 --> 08:47.114
Dresses up to impress a rich investor,
dresses down for a poor farmer.

08:47.670 --> 08:51.663
This guy is a chameleon,
he can adapt to any situation.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.321
You know, from the outside
this house seems clean and shiny,

08:56.330 --> 08:57.615
you know, but it's like it's all for show.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.703
Like it's a facade to hide
what's really going on.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.075
Drawer full of catalogs.

09:10.670 --> 09:15.039
Uniforms for law enforcement,
construction, janitorial, military.

09:16.170 --> 09:17.876
What do you think he needs these for?

09:18.420 --> 09:21.571
Probably has something to do with this.

09:21.580 --> 09:24.242
Someone's trying to disguise himself.

09:52.460 --> 09:53.996
Room service.

09:59.580 --> 10:00.877
Room service.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.497
We received your call to pick up
last night's dinner, Mr. Gregory.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.706
Yes. Come in.

10:16.670 --> 10:17.955
Was everything okay?

10:18.540 --> 10:22.419
My porterhouse was juicy and rare,
just the way I like it,

10:22.420 --> 10:26.993
but my wife wasn't feeling very well,
hoping a hot bath will do the trick.

10:27.500 --> 10:31.459
Honey, how is everything in there?
I guess pretty good.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.206
Thank you very much, Oscar.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.531
Angel,
Mark Gregory was such a bad boy.

10:45.540 --> 10:46.666
How bad?

10:46.670 --> 10:48.160
Well, when he was, like, a kid,

10:48.170 --> 10:49.876
he was caught peeking
in a neighbor's window.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.199
And I'm sure it gets worse, right?

10:51.210 --> 10:53.326
Mmm-hmm. At the ripe age of 18, he...

10:53.330 --> 10:54.536
How do I put this delicately,

10:55.120 --> 10:57.247
had an intense affection for ladies
With learner's permits.

10:57.830 --> 11:00.913
Well, that sounds like statutory rape,
I'm not surprised. You talk to Hotch?

11:00.920 --> 11:03.912
Yeah, it turns out his marriage
lasted only 23 days.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.410
Our boy's got serious commitment issues.

11:05.420 --> 11:07.115
And fret not, my sweet,
that poor girl who married him

11:07.120 --> 11:08.246
is still out there somewhere.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.490
If she were dead,
it would be easier to find her.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.957
Well, that's a good thing, because
we're going to want to talk to her.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.327
Some of his deviant behavior must've
leaked into other parts of his life.

11:16.330 --> 11:17.570
At least she got out alive.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.878
We found evidence at his house
that he acclimates well

11:30.880 --> 11:33.667
to different surroundings.
Possible disguises.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.207
He's emptied his bank accounts
and he's put his dogs in a kennel.

11:37.210 --> 11:40.168
We're certain he's left the area
and he's not coming back.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.991
And since he's on the run,
this classifies him as a spree killer.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.709
Usually this type of killer goes through
two phases, guided and random.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.828
Guided means that this killer stays in
his particular geographic area

11:50.830 --> 11:52.741
or comfort zone until he breaks down.

11:52.750 --> 11:55.241
That's why he killed the first
four women in a 60-mile radius?

11:55.250 --> 11:57.457
That's right,
and we're hoping he's still there.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.452
In the guided phase, they usually have
a final destination in mind.

12:00.830 --> 12:02.616
Like Edmund Kemper and Andrew Cunanan,

12:02.620 --> 12:05.077
they saved their most
meaningful kills until last.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.287
We should find out who that would be
for Gregory.

12:07.290 --> 12:10.748
When the random phase begins,
the kills seem to be without design,

12:10.750 --> 12:13.822
there's less time in between them.
At that point, he's lost total control.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.918
And as he devolves,
he's going to take more victims

12:16.920 --> 12:19.912
-and become less noticeable.
-What does that mean?

12:19.920 --> 12:22.741
In Gregory's case,
his MO is the torture.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.327
That would mean he will torture less

12:26.330 --> 12:31.700
and spend more time on the thing that
gives him sexual release, drowning.

12:31.710 --> 12:34.372
So it's very important that we find
him while he's still in the comfort zone.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.786
After that, there's no telling
where he'll be.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.451
- -Excuse me.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.826
We'll get a release out to
all the major networks.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.913
His face, possible disguises will be
all over the country by dinner time.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.036
Got it.
They just found the missing girl's body.

12:46.540 --> 12:48.952
-Close by?
-No, Georgia.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.452
Come on, Elle.
Looks like we're going to Georgia.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.206
Elle and Morgan just landed in Georgia.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.030
They'll be at the hotel
in about 20 minutes.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.826
So, Florida's not his only comfort zone.

13:05.830 --> 13:08.116
No, apparently he set up businesses
throughout the southern US.

13:08.540 --> 13:10.952
Well, we have warnings along I-95 and I-10

13:10.960 --> 13:13.030
in case he decides to travel along
the Gulf Coast.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.702
Well, now that he's crossed state lines,
it's a nationwide search.

13:15.710 --> 13:17.780
He doesn't want to get caught,
so he'll probably alter his route

13:17.790 --> 13:20.167
-and drive quieter roads.
-We'|l prepare for that, too.

13:20.170 --> 13:21.239
These records indicate

13:21.250 --> 13:23.115
that he went to high school
in four different states.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.829
So he moved around a lot.
Let's talk to his father. Find out why.

13:26.830 --> 13:29.071
Maybe he's revisiting places
where he feels comfortable.

13:29.080 --> 13:32.709
The latest ho_tel records indicate that
he checked in usmg his own name.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.951
You know, if he doesn't want us
to catch him then what's he doing?

13:34.960 --> 13:36.666
No, taunting would imply

13:36.670 --> 13:38.535
that this is some sort of game. It isn't.

13:38.540 --> 13:40.667
He's made it very clear
that he has no intention

13:40.670 --> 13:43.616
of going back to his life as it was.
This is a one-way trip.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.168
There's DNA proving he's the offender.

13:46.170 --> 13:48.991
No point in covering his tracks now.
That would only slow him down.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.571
And if he wanted us to catch him,
he'd simply stop running.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.912
It's not likely.
He's got 400 grand in cash.

13:54.330 --> 13:57.117
That type of money,
he could charter a plane or buy a ticket

13:57.120 --> 13:58.872
virtually anywhere in the world.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.609
Well, he's not hiding, he's hunting.

14:00.620 --> 14:01.826
Besides, driving works for him.

14:01.830 --> 14:04.162
It's anonymous
and he can cover a lot of territory.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.286
We should notify the Mexican
and Canadian border patrols.

14:06.290 --> 14:07.700
He might try to leave the US.

14:07.710 --> 14:10.372
Let them know that most
spree kill send with suicide by cop.

14:10.380 --> 14:12.746
Could be how he plans on
getting out of this mess.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.571
ATLANTA, GEORGIA

14:21.170 --> 14:23.661
Wow, Mark Gregory splurges on
hotel rooms, doesn't he?

14:23.670 --> 14:25.285
Yeah, great guy.

14:25.750 --> 14:29.743
He offers them a nice, warm robe
right before he drowns them.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.207
He spent a lot of time
with Nicole Wegener.

14:32.620 --> 14:35.919
Picked her up in Tampa,
drove her all the way to Georgia.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.286
But unlike his other victims,

14:38.290 --> 14:40.326
there was no type of relationship
to link the two of them.

14:40.330 --> 14:43.322
A random victim with
her whole life ahead of her.

14:43.330 --> 14:44.570
She was beautiful.

14:44.580 --> 14:46.241
She was also a stranger,

14:46.250 --> 14:47.786
so it means he had to lure her somehow.

14:50.330 --> 14:52.070
Mark Gregory, photographer.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.117
So, what if he preyed on
this woman's vanity.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.112
He's a photographer, he offers her
a professional modeling career.

15:00.500 --> 15:05.039
Well, if he has a legitimate web site
and portfolio,

15:05.040 --> 15:06.780
right credentials,
why wouldn't she trust him?

15:07.500 --> 15:09.661
And a perfected ruse would explain
how he was able to get her

15:09.670 --> 15:12.070
through the lobby of a
five-star hotel with no one looking.

15:12.670 --> 15:15.616
It's just a matter of time before
he finds himself another victim.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.322
I think I just left it in the car.
We got time, right, honey?

15:36.330 --> 15:37.570
Yeah,
we got at least another 10 minutes.

15:37.580 --> 15:41.414
We're not going to be running late?
All right, yeah...

15:44.250 --> 15:45.615
Hotchner.

15:45.620 --> 15:47.281
Who is your daddy?

15:47.620 --> 15:49.417
-I'm sorry?-This has not been easy.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.285
This woman seriously covered her tracks.

15:51.290 --> 15:53.918
-Do you have the right number

15:53.920 --> 15:56.491
-You found her?
-Yeah, still in the Sunshine State.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.661
-Settled down in Bradenton.-We'll pick her up.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.610
Well, that's understandable.

16:01.620 --> 16:05.659
I'm more surprised that you found me.
I paid a lot to have my past erased.

16:06.790 --> 16:09.452
Are you saying you're not surprised
that Mark is a serial killer?

16:09.460 --> 16:10.916
I knew something was wrong.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.785
That's why we were only married
for three weeks.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.787
Have you been in hiding because you
were afraid he would come after you?

16:15.790 --> 16:18.782
He stalked me for a few years
after the annulment.

16:18.790 --> 16:21.668
I had to disappear if I wanted to survive.

16:22.170 --> 16:25.321
I know it was a long time ago,
but what was life with him like?

16:26.380 --> 16:29.372
Terrible. He was controlling.
Didn't trust me.

16:29.380 --> 16:32.918
Insisted I was cheating on him
with anyone, with everyone.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.070
I couldn't leave the house.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.490
I'm sorry to dredge all this up,

16:36.500 --> 16:38.070
but you've definitely helped us
understand him.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.326
He dated his first victim,
and if she cheated on him

16:41.330 --> 16:44.208
it may have been the thing that,
that started him killing.

16:46.250 --> 16:48.912
I still can't understand how my son
could be responsible for this.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.241
SARASOTA, FLO RI DA

16:51.250 --> 16:53.741
Yo_ur son's a narcissist
With split-personality.

16:53.750 --> 16:57.163
He's able to gain his victim's trust
before inflicting pain upon them.

16:57.170 --> 17:00.913
This is most likely derived from an
incredible amount of self-awareness.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.286
Mark has mastered the art of manipulation.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.451
Only allows you to see his good side.

17:05.460 --> 17:06.916
This is a nightmare.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.110
Why don't you sit down, Mr. Gregory?

17:20.080 --> 17:23.038
You moved around_a lot
when Mark was growmg up?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.746
Mark never complained.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.492
I guess it's because
he was always good at making friends.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.320
He fit in wherever we went.

17:29.330 --> 17:31.412
We know he's been to Georgia.
Do you know where else he might go?

17:31.420 --> 17:34.207
Any places he loved to visit

17:34.210 --> 17:37.998
We lived here the longest.
He would consider Florida home.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.530
Mark's mother isn't in any photos.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.780
Elizabeth died in a car accident.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.739
I'm sorry.

17:55.250 --> 17:56.786
How old was Mark when that happened?

17:56.790 --> 17:58.109
Ten.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.496
Were they close?

17:59.500 --> 18:00.990
She was his mother.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.913
Typically when a child loses a mother,
he sees her as a victim.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.320
Which, you know, theoretically,
he'd want to protect women.

18:07.330 --> 18:09.321
More likely to lash out
against the father,

18:09.330 --> 18:13.073
blaming men for needing punishment,
but Mark didn't do that.

18:13.080 --> 18:15.207
-Because you and Mark were close.
-Yes.

18:15.210 --> 18:17.610
Any reason he would've blamed his
mother for her death?

18:17.620 --> 18:18.871
-Was she drinking and driving...
-No.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.700
-...falling asleep at a wheel, anything?
-No.

18:20.710 --> 18:22.746
No, no, nothing like that.

18:23.420 --> 18:27.163
Maybe he blames her because
he thinks she abandoned him?

18:27.670 --> 18:30.707
The loss of a female figure
could explain why...

18:30.710 --> 18:32.996
Peeping Tom in adolescence.

18:33.580 --> 18:37.493
Are you telling me that young boys
aren't curious?

18:37.500 --> 18:40.162
Sure, they're curious,
but not all of them peek into windows.

18:40.170 --> 18:43.913
-What about the statutory rape charge?
-Oh, no.

18:43.920 --> 18:49.119
Mark had just turned 18
and his girlfriend was 15.

18:49.830 --> 18:52.287
They were kids, for God's sake.

18:52.290 --> 18:55.498
It was her parents that pressed charges.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.412
Did Mark ever have to take
responsibility for anything?

18:58.420 --> 19:00.206
Look, what are you saying?

19:00.580 --> 19:05.700
That being a protective parent
has turned my child into a killer?

19:05.710 --> 19:09.032
No, I'm saying you're making excuses.
I'm not sure it did him any favors.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.578
You're going to be okay. Yeah.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.029
Wake up.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.495
Based on these interviews,

20:22.500 --> 20:24.411
it looks like the first victim
wasn't being unfaithful.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.661
She had a husband
and was trying to keep it secret.

20:26.670 --> 20:27.876
Sounds like he found out.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.609
Yeah, there must have been
something major in his past

20:29.620 --> 20:31.497
to trigger such an extreme reaction.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.957
Maybe something
with his parents' relationship

20:33.960 --> 20:36.451
Hey, guys]

20:36.460 --> 20:39.532
I found Mark Gregory's car
at Atlanta International Airport.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.917
That's pretty smart.
There's a sea of cars at the airport.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.161
But he parked in short-term
and he got a ticket.

20:44.170 --> 20:46.035
There must have another reason
for him to dump it there.

20:46.290 --> 20:49.282
Guys, I know we ruled out flying,
but it's hard to ignore the fact

20:49.290 --> 20:50.746
that his last known location was a place

20:50.750 --> 20:53.617
that literally had thousands of
international flights a day.

20:54.170 --> 20:55.819
Thousands of people, all possible victims.

20:55.830 --> 20:56.910
Hey, Garcia,

20:56.920 --> 20:59.115
is it possible to run the face recognition
sobeare at the airport?

20:59.120 --> 21:01.577
I'm already on it. I went ahead
and started with security footage

21:01.580 --> 21:03.571
at the parking garage
since we know he was in there.

21:03.580 --> 21:06.162
Knowing what he looks like's
got to be some advantage to us.

21:06.170 --> 21:12.609
And it is. I'm uploading to you right now.

21:12.620 --> 21:13.780
Thanks.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.916
She seemed like his type.
HOTCH: Yeah,

21:28.830 --> 21:31.742
he's looking for the easiest target.
He doesn't have time to waste.

21:32.830 --> 21:34.912
Who doesn't trust
a man in uniform?

21:36.790 --> 21:37.996
He helps her.

21:40.080 --> 21:42.321
She returns the favor
and gives him a ride.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.286
Fatal mistake.

21:48.330 --> 21:51.914
As you can see in the footage,
he's been able to access uniforms.

21:51.920 --> 21:55.788
Most likely he'll use those of authority
to try and invoke a feeling of safety.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.786
He may also be using disguises.

21:58.790 --> 22:02.169
He's suspected of having approached
a woman with a photography ruse.

22:02.830 --> 22:04.616
Gregory has credentials.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.168
He was a photographer in Miami for years.

22:08.790 --> 22:12.999
He's well-traveled and conducts business
throughout the southern United States.

22:14.420 --> 22:18.072
There's no chance of predicting
where he'll strike next.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.288
That's why we are asking you
to be aware and on the lookout

22:21.290 --> 22:23.611
for this 38-year-old white male.

22:25.710 --> 22:29.168
He appears to be very confident,
trustworthy, and charming.

22:46.710 --> 22:50.032
Let's review what we know.
Gregory Will continue to drown.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.747
The question is why does he have to?

22:52.750 --> 22:56.322
We know someone who murders
by drowning wants to invoke fear.

22:56.330 --> 22:59.379
If water symbolizes emotion
it says they're overwhelmed

22:59.380 --> 23:03.202
by their own unresolved issues
or facing some sort of major life crisis.

23:03.960 --> 23:07.999
It suggests a release of the old is
necessary to emerge and begin anew.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.208
So there's something
he's trying to purge or cleanse

23:12.210 --> 23:15.031
Yeah, I think that's exactly right.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.032
Excuse me, gentlemen.

23:18.460 --> 23:19.609
Sorry to interrupt.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.707
You really don't know someone
until you take a road trip with them.

23:26.460 --> 23:29.281
-What are you trying to say?
-Look at this car, man.

23:29.290 --> 23:32.782
There's empty soda cans
and fast food wrappers everywhere.

23:33.210 --> 23:34.325
You're a slob.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.070
You know, back at Quantico,
your desk is all neat,

23:36.080 --> 23:38.492
but I bet you if you looked in those
drawers, you'd find a mess.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.821
Okay, we have been on the road
way too long.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.997
-Aw, that must be the boyfriend.
-Yes, it is.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.418
Hey, Gideon. Uh-huh.

23:50.540 --> 23:51.529
Okay.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.951
Yeah. Got it. Yep.

23:58.250 --> 24:01.708
They found the woman from
the Atlanta airport in South Carolina.

24:01.710 --> 24:03.575
You know, it feels like
we're driving from body to body.

24:03.580 --> 24:05.070
Yeah, well, we know that South Carolina's

24:05.080 --> 24:06.911
part of his business route.

24:06.920 --> 24:08.876
So, he's probably going back
to what he knows.

24:22.960 --> 24:25.076
See something?

24:25.080 --> 24:27.571
No, I was just thinking about
the information we released about

24:27.580 --> 24:29.878
-Mark Gregory at the press conference.
-What about it?

24:29.880 --> 24:32.030
Well, we described him
as someone who's engaging,

24:32.040 --> 24:34.281
confident, poses as people with authority,

24:34.290 --> 24:36.417
but this is a guy who's flying
under the radar.

24:36.420 --> 24:39.241
-So what, we made a mistake?
-No, not at all, no.

24:39.250 --> 24:42.879
We're dealing with a killer who's highly
intelligent and incredibly resourceful.

24:42.880 --> 24:46.111
You would think that we've pushed him
to change what he's doing.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.206
To what?

24:48.210 --> 24:50.496
Maybe he's not using
a simple ruse anymore?

24:50.500 --> 24:53.116
He could alter his appearance
so he's barely recognizable,

24:53.120 --> 24:54.246
just like in the sketch book.

24:54.620 --> 24:57.919
If he does that,
we have no idea what we're looking for.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.372
SOUTH CAROLINA

25:05.880 --> 25:07.370
FBI. Morgan and Greenaway.

25:12.170 --> 25:15.116
-This place...
-Is a hole-in-the-wall.

25:15.790 --> 25:19.248
I don't know why he's checking into
a fleabag motel. Gregory's got cash.

25:19.250 --> 25:22.413
He's obviously devolved into
the random phase of his kills.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.240
It must have something to do with
how he views his victims.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.706
Well, if he doesn't know these women,

25:25.710 --> 25:28.531
maybe he thinks
that they're not worthy or dirty.

25:28.540 --> 25:31.577
-You the manager

25:31.580 --> 25:33.992
Yeah. Do you recognize this man?

25:34.000 --> 25:35.956
Yeah, that kind of looks like the guy.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.326
He paid his bill in cash
about three hours ago.

25:38.330 --> 25:41.959
-You sure about the time?
-Absolutely. My stories were on.

25:41.960 --> 25:45.612
Well, given the lividity,
I'd say she died right before that.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.070
Did you happen to see what he was driving?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.616
Yeah, one of those black SUVs.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.497
That's the victim's car
from the Atlanta Airport.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.070
Did you notice if it had Georgia plates?

25:53.080 --> 25:55.321
No, they definitely had
South Carolina plates.

25:55.330 --> 25:57.616
When he was filling out the forms
for the motel,

25:57.620 --> 26:00.248
he couldn't remember the numbers
so I went outside to write it down.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.741
That's why we can't track him,
he's switching plates.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.325
Can you get us those numbers, please?

26:04.330 --> 26:06.742
-Sure, I'll be right back.
-Thank you.

26:09.170 --> 26:10.569
Well, there's the pilot's uniform.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.782
Well, we know his identity,
we know he likes to use disguises,

26:13.790 --> 26:15.917
and he doesn't care about leaving them.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.740
Look at the level of torture here.

26:18.330 --> 26:19.661
He spent the least
amount of time with her,

26:19.670 --> 26:21.456
but he still shocked her enough
to turn her feet black.

26:21.460 --> 26:24.748
No normal human being
can sustain this kind of torture.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.456
I mean,

26:26.460 --> 26:29.167
if he shocked her over and over again,
then she must've died.

26:29.170 --> 26:30.990
But the cause of death was a wet drowning.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.456
The only way he could have done that,

26:32.460 --> 26:34.781
resuscitate her every time,
just so he can drown her again.

26:34.790 --> 26:36.951
We know that he was spending
two days with these women,

26:36.960 --> 26:39.952
but he picked her up
at the airport yesterday.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.951
So, he's spending half as much time
with them now.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.531
And now he's probably
got himself another one.

26:46.380 --> 26:47.449
Hotchner.

26:47.460 --> 26:49.530
-Who's the answer to all your
dreams?-I'm going to put you on speaker.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.576
Oh, you completely suck.

26:51.580 --> 26:55.164
Hospital records show Mark Gregory
fractured a vertebra when he was 10.

26:55.170 --> 26:57.877
He suffered damage to his spine,
ligaments, and neck.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.280
Whiplash.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.877
Behold the wonderful genius
of Dr. Spencer Reid.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.110
Honey, that's exactly what the rest
of the hospital record says.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.451
Now, I did some more digging.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.031
I found an article in the Polk County
paper describing the crash.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.496
-What did it say?-Well, the headline reads

27:11.500 --> 27:13.616
that Elizabeth Gregory
died in the crash, but here we go,

27:14.040 --> 27:15.496
her 10-year-old son was only injured.

27:16.420 --> 27:19.162
-Mark Gregory was in the car with her?-Apparently.

27:20.290 --> 27:21.700
We need to talk to Gregory's father,

27:21.710 --> 27:23.496
find out what else he's keeping from us.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.747
Do you need some help with your bags, sir?

27:38.750 --> 27:40.456
No. I'm good. Thank you very much.

27:40.460 --> 27:41.700
-Oh.
-Oh.

27:41.710 --> 27:44.247
-Oh.
-Oh, my.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.326
-Thank you.
-No problem.

27:47.170 --> 27:50.788
You know, actually,
I would like a little help. Thank you.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.820
Perfect. That's what I'm here for.

28:01.250 --> 28:05.163
Well, I know you guys didn't come here
to look at pictures of my son.

28:05.170 --> 28:07.115
Did something happen?

28:07.580 --> 28:09.411
Why are there
no memories of your wife here?

28:09.420 --> 28:13.163
Why would I want to remind my son

28:13.170 --> 28:15.570
of the most horrible thing
that ever happened to him?

28:15.960 --> 28:17.825
Normally when a parent dies,

28:17.830 --> 28:20.037
the other parent tends to overcompensate

28:20.040 --> 28:22.417
by building a shrine of pictures,

28:22.420 --> 28:25.537
leaving their personal effects untouched,
sometimes for years.

28:25.540 --> 28:27.701
-Well...
-You didn't happen to do that.

28:27.710 --> 28:30.417
Why didn't you tell us your son was
in the car when your wife died?

28:31.330 --> 28:33.787
I didn't think it was important.

28:35.830 --> 28:37.536
You didn't think it was important?

28:37.540 --> 28:39.201
You didn't think
it was important to tell us

28:39.210 --> 28:42.282
-your son witnessed his mother dying?
-No.

28:42.290 --> 28:46.078
The fact that he witnessed his mother
die at such a young age,

28:46.080 --> 28:48.116
it clearly affected how he regards women.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.748
Do you know why your son was
married for such a short period of time?

28:50.750 --> 28:54.038
-Yes, it was a mistake, he was young.
-Oh.

28:54.040 --> 28:55.530
Well, we talked to his ex-wife.

28:55.540 --> 28:58.247
Mark was obsessed with thinking
she was unfaithful.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.072
-It could happen.
-Well, she never was,

29:02.080 --> 29:04.617
but he made life unbearable for her.
She couldn't leave the house.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.951
She couldn't take a breath
without worrying about it.

29:06.750 --> 29:09.708
Something must've happened
to feed that distrust

29:09.710 --> 29:12.873
and give him such a distorted view
of relationships.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.745
How were things with your wife,
Mr. Gregory?

29:15.210 --> 29:17.531
Normal and uneventful.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.536
-Was she being unfaithful

29:20.790 --> 29:22.701
Did she pick men up,
Mark find out, catch her in the act?

29:22.710 --> 29:25.076
No! All right, all right, enough. Stop it.

29:27.380 --> 29:28.608
Uh...

29:30.420 --> 29:34.709
When she couldn't find a baby-sitter,
she would take him with her

29:34.710 --> 29:38.077
to the motel and let him play by the pool.

29:38.620 --> 29:41.578
This went on for over a year.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.912
What kind of mother would do that?

29:44.540 --> 29:46.917
You ever take him to therapy, Mr. Gregory?

29:46.920 --> 29:48.205
-No.
-Why?

29:48.210 --> 29:51.373
-I didn't think he needed it.
-You didn't think he needed it?

29:51.380 --> 29:53.416
-No.
-A boy watches his mother die.

29:53.420 --> 29:55.160
He lives. She dies.

29:55.170 --> 29:56.785
You don't think that's confusing
to a 10-year-old kid?

29:56.790 --> 29:58.667
-I didn't say that.
-You did say that.

29:59.170 --> 30:00.819
Mark was smart enough
to know what was going on.

30:00.830 --> 30:03.572
That explains his issues with infidelity,
his hatred towards women,

30:03.580 --> 30:06.287
and now why he tortures and drowns them.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.201
His first victim was married.

30:09.210 --> 30:13.829
She was having an affair with him,
which it clearly reminded him

30:13.830 --> 30:15.411
of what his mother did to you.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.417
Do you think your wife's death
was an accident?

30:18.420 --> 30:20.206
I honestly don't know.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.201
Well, what do you know, Mr. Gregory What do you feel?

30:22.210 --> 30:23.575
Do you even know what I'm talking about?

30:23.580 --> 30:26.037
Well, okay, I had my suspicions.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.167
Well, your son did what you thought
about doing a hundred times.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.821
These are innocent women,
innocent women, Mr. Gregory.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.162
Ever occur to you your son might be
trying to stand up for you

30:34.170 --> 30:36.206
in his own sick, demented way
because you weren't there?

30:36.210 --> 30:38.531
-You weren't there, Mr. Gregory!
-Well, I...

30:40.000 --> 30:43.322
Help us, before he kills
again and again and again.

30:43.790 --> 30:45.872
Help us, Mr. Gregory. Help us.

31:01.290 --> 31:05.909
Gideon! Gideon, you do know that
Doug Gregory isn't the killer, right?

31:06.920 --> 31:10.492
Yes, I know that, but he protected one,

31:10.500 --> 31:12.616
and now at least six women
are dead because of it.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.371
Come on. Move it.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.660
No.

31:23.210 --> 31:24.370
No. No!

31:42.500 --> 31:45.412
Hey, you can't be in the pool
with your clothes on.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.319
Hey, man.

31:48.330 --> 31:50.958
-Is everything okay?
-Help me, my wife,

31:50.960 --> 31:52.200
she fell in the pool and she can't swim.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.166
All right.
Well, bring her over to the side.

31:54.170 --> 31:56.912
I don't know CPR, do you?

31:58.670 --> 32:00.615
Please, help me. Help her.

32:00.620 --> 32:03.578
All right. All right.
Boy, she's not breathing.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.075
Please, help her.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.991
Look, man, I'm doing the best that I can.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.410
Why don't you go call 911?

32:11.750 --> 32:13.456
Go call 911, man.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.378
Oh, there we go. There you go.
Get it out. Get it out.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.200
All right. There you go, honey.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.326
-That's right. You keep breathing.
-No, no, no.

32:26.330 --> 32:28.537
Hey, it's all right.
It's okay. It's all right.

32:28.540 --> 32:31.111
It's all right. Keep... You're breathing.
There you go, honey.

32:31.120 --> 32:32.667
You're all right.

32:32.670 --> 32:34.740
Your husband's going to be right back.

32:34.750 --> 32:35.785
-Yeah.
-No.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.111
Have you found any other suspicious
drownings the last couple of days?

32:42.120 --> 32:44.532
Aaron, do you have any idea
how many people drown every day?

32:44.540 --> 32:46.781
Well, yes, there are more
in the summer for obvious reasons,

32:46.790 --> 32:50.419
but I think it averages to what,
6,500 a year, which is 17 a day.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.450
-Is this Reid

32:52.460 --> 32:54.451
I am, slick, I am.

32:54.790 --> 32:56.610
You've been doing your research,
haven't you?

32:57.880 --> 33:00.917
Hey, this one sounds particularly creepy.

33:02.040 --> 33:03.667
Garcia found a lead in Tennessee.

33:03.670 --> 33:06.116
Allyson Glennon was snatched from
a grocery store a couple hours ago

33:06.120 --> 33:08.452
and survived an attempted drowning
in a motel pool.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.451
Motel pool?
That doesn't sound like our guy.

33:10.460 --> 33:12.872
Yeah, I know except that she's identified
Gregory as her attacker,

33:12.880 --> 33:15.451
and the place is less
than an hour from the last killing.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.746
Garcia's giving Elle and Morgan
details right now.

33:17.750 --> 33:18.819
Good.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.491
Reid and I had another talk
with Mark's father.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.536
We need to get everybody on the phone.

33:25.670 --> 33:26.785
Hey, Gideon.

33:26.790 --> 33:29.202
We think Mark's first victim
was his mother.

33:29.210 --> 33:30.370
What?

33:30.380 --> 33:33.952
I'm sorry. You're saying
a 10-year-old killed his own mom?

33:33.960 --> 33:36.576
Well, it's a common theory
that sons can fixate on their mothers

33:36.580 --> 33:38.878
since their mothers
are their introduction to love.

33:38.880 --> 33:40.871
And if that mother had
a negative influence on him,

33:40.880 --> 33:43.667
in this case, she was an adulteress,
it invalidated not only the father,

33:43.670 --> 33:45.456
but it reflected poorly onto the son.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.701
Mark Gregory was a child,
but he was old enough to understand

33:47.710 --> 33:48.825
what his mother was doing.

33:48.830 --> 33:51.708
He was protecting a weak, impotent,
passive-aggressive father

33:51.710 --> 33:52.825
who wanted his wife dead.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.912
He read the old man like a book
and lived the life he couldn't.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.785
Because she was his mother,
he saw her as a saint,

33:56.790 --> 33:59.281
but because she was a cheater,
he also saw her as a sinner.

34:00.670 --> 34:02.615
There's a good chance
he caused the car to crash.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.702
Do you think the father knew his son
was a murderer?

34:04.710 --> 34:05.779
Yes.

34:05.790 --> 34:06.870
It's why he's so
overprotective of him.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.996
We need to go through all
of the evidence from the car accident.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.570
Absolutely everything.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.537
News articles, medical records,
police reports. I'm on it.

34:13.540 --> 34:14.871
We need to do it
as quickly as possible.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.326
He's a killer on the run, and he's
grabbing women as he sees them.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.871
I got done sooner than I thought,

34:19.880 --> 34:22.576
so I'll be able to pick up the kids
after the bell.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.821
Oh, okay, see you then.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.991
Do exactly as I say or you'll die.

34:41.620 --> 34:42.746
COPPERHILL, TENNESSEE

34:42.750 --> 34:44.240
Anyway, when I got to the pool,
he said he was gonna call for help,

34:44.250 --> 34:45.569
but he just disappeared.

34:45.580 --> 34:47.536
So, you're thinking,
why wouldn't I trust this guy, huh?

34:47.540 --> 34:49.451
What kind of psycho would kill
somebody in front of witnesses?

34:49.460 --> 34:53.078
Yeah, yeah and I've seen the news,
but, well, this man didn't look like

34:53.080 --> 34:54.786
the one you're looking for.

34:54.790 --> 34:58.669
He left his glasses in the pool,
and when he left he walked with a limp

34:58.670 --> 35:03.073
and nobody said anything about
glasses or a limp, so...

35:03.460 --> 35:05.667
He might be in a hurry,
but he's not looking to get caught.

35:06.250 --> 35:07.820
Because he's not done killing yet.

35:07.830 --> 35:10.617
Here's the police photo of the car
Gregory's mother was killed in.

35:10.620 --> 35:12.611
Right there. See the water dripping
from the under the car?

35:12.620 --> 35:14.531
It doesn't look like
it'd be a fatal car crash.

35:14.540 --> 35:17.498
All the damage was done on
the passenger side?

35:17.920 --> 35:20.241
-What was her official cause of death?
-I'll ask Garcia.

35:20.880 --> 35:25.112
We've got a possible abduction.
Kelly Dalton, 28.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.328
Eyewitness saw her leaving a parking lot
with a man who resembled Gregory.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.372
She was supposed to pick up her son,
never made it.

35:34.620 --> 35:35.609
Thanks, Hotch.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.031
He's picked up a new victim.
Hey, we got to get to the mall.

35:40.540 --> 35:42.952
Jump on 113, take 10 minutes.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.168
It was better when he _had a ruse.
At least that reqUIred a little planning.

35:47.170 --> 35:49.456
...believed to have
left the parking lot and headed...

35:49.460 --> 35:51.280
They were driving
a green Jeep with Tennessee plates.

35:51.290 --> 35:52.530
Last seen on route 60...

35:53.290 --> 35:56.032
If you see this vehicle,
please contact the state highway patrol...

35:56.040 --> 35:58.247
Do you want money or something?
Because I've got a rich husband

35:58.250 --> 35:59.660
and I know he'd pay a lot to get me back.

35:59.670 --> 36:02.070
He's described as a Caucasian male,
38 years old with dark blonde hair.

36:02.080 --> 36:04.992
So, he's got a victim and a car.
Now all he needs is the location.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.037
Okay, there are five sources
of water nearby.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.667
Closest to the accident is...

36:09.670 --> 36:12.241
-Rock Creek in...-Copperhill, Tennessee.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.161
That's where Kelly Dalton was abducted.

36:14.170 --> 36:17.788
-Morgan and Elle are there right now.
-Reid, one more thing.

36:17.790 --> 36:19.451
Elizabeth Gregory's
official cause of death

36:19.460 --> 36:22.497
was asphyxia caused by immersion in fluid.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.029
She drowned?

36:26.170 --> 36:29.822
With no discernible damage done to her,
keeping her trapped in the car,

36:29.830 --> 36:33.709
what would cause a tal_ler mother to
drown and a smaller child to survwe?

36:34.880 --> 36:36.529
There's only one way.

36:38.080 --> 36:41.789
Mark Gregory held his mother's head
under whatever water was in the car.

36:43.170 --> 36:45.115
His first kill was his most powerful.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.701
Well, at least we know where he's going.

36:53.330 --> 36:55.207
Back to where it all started.

37:06.540 --> 37:08.997
Please, I have two boys. They need me.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.319
Shut up.

37:10.330 --> 37:12.616
The police report
said the accident was on route 60

37:12.620 --> 37:14.576
near East-West Highway.

37:14.580 --> 37:17.117
We're on route 60 about a quarter
of a mile from Rock Creek.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.532
I'm pulling over.
We're going to check it out.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.661
-This is all your fault.
-What is?

37:31.170 --> 37:33.206
I saw you every week with that man.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.820
You think I don't know what was going on?

37:35.830 --> 37:38.958
-I've never met you before.
-Shut up! You're a liar!

37:40.040 --> 37:41.280
Turn here.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.661
Yeah, Gideon, he's not here.

37:58.210 --> 37:59.700
Hey, slow down.

38:01.620 --> 38:02.917
Stop!

38:04.170 --> 38:05.740
Stop! Stop!

38:12.580 --> 38:14.411
You guys hear that?
-Yeah, I heard it.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.411
It's over there. Come on, let's go.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.662
No! No!

39:06.670 --> 39:07.659
Please!

39:08.540 --> 39:10.417
-No one will hear you.
-Somebody help me!

39:10.420 --> 39:12.706
-It's just the two of us here.
-Help!

39:30.540 --> 39:32.531
It's clear. Nobody in the car.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.706
We just found her car, it's empty.

39:34.710 --> 39:36.917
We're going into the woods.
Keep you posted.

39:37.170 --> 39:39.286
-Which way to the water?
-It's over there.

39:45.540 --> 39:48.168
Help me! Help me!

39:48.670 --> 39:51.707
-Somebody help! Help!
-It's coming from up over there.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.376
How does that feel?

40:07.330 --> 40:09.207
Shut up. Nobody can hear you.

40:42.420 --> 40:46.038
Mark Gregory. FBI!
Put it down. Put it down.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.701
Come here. I got you.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.609
You okay?

40:57.290 --> 41:00.111
Come on. I got you. You're okay. Come on.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.410
Okay. It's okay.

41:09.790 --> 41:11.951
Come on. It's okay.

41:18.120 --> 41:19.997
Hey, it's Morgan.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.877
Kelly Dalton's going to be okay.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.536
Gregory's dead. We're coming home.

41:51.460 --> 41:54.031
