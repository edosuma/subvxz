02:27.347 --> 02:28.915
The <i> Bubble Tug</i> here

Hi!

ALL:
Good morning, Mr. Grouper.

03:16.963 --> 03:18.364

everyone.

03:18.431 --> 03:22.969

03:26.272 --> 03:28.174
Wha--?

03:28.241 --> 03:30.410
What does "ahoy" mean?

03:30.476 --> 03:32.612
"Ahoy" is how
sailors say "hello".

03:32.679 --> 03:34.314
That's right, Nonny.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.516
Are you guys sailors
on boats?

03:36.583 --> 03:39.285
No, but we met
the captain of a tugboat.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.621
He said "ahoy".

03:41.688 --> 03:44.591
The captain is the person
who's in charge of the boat.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.060
{\an8}I like boats.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.060
{\an8}Me too.

03:47.126 --> 03:49.495
{\an8}Oh, I do too.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.431
{\an8}Boats come in so many different
shapes and sizes,

03:51.497 --> 03:54.300
{\an8}but they all have
one thing in common:

03:54.367 --> 03:55.902
{\an8}they float
on top of the water.

03:55.969 --> 04:00.873
Have you seen
a boat float before?

04:00.940 --> 04:04.510
Yep! All boats
float on the water.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.814
Let's think about boats!

04:07.880 --> 04:11.050
Boats turn around when the
captain turns the steering...

04:14.087 --> 04:15.288
{\an3}Wheel!

04:15.355 --> 04:16.889
That's right.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.156
The steering wheel.

04:18.224 --> 04:21.494
And boats stop moving when
the captain lowers the...

04:24.764 --> 04:26.165
{\an3}Anchor!

04:26.232 --> 04:28.801
The anchor, that's right!

04:28.868 --> 04:30.870
Some boats
are pushed by the...

04:34.440 --> 04:35.842
{\an3}Wind!

04:35.908 --> 04:37.477
Right, the wind.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.512
Sailboats use wind power,

04:39.579 --> 04:43.650
and other boats
use people power like rowboats,

04:43.716 --> 04:48.054
or are machine-powered
like speedboats.

10:51.450 --> 10:54.186
We're islanders.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.956
Islanders who love boats.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.058
Once upon a time...

10:59.125 --> 11:02.395
<i>There were three islanders</i>
<i>who loved to go boating</i>

11:02.461 --> 11:04.730
<i>in their speedboat.</i>

11:04.797 --> 11:07.833
Whoo!

11:09.001 --> 11:10.770
I love waterskiing!

11:10.836 --> 11:13.406
Me too! Go faster!

11:14.707 --> 11:16.776
Okay.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.378
Whoo!

11:22.448 --> 11:25.518
NONNY:
<i>When suddenly...</i>

11:25.584 --> 11:26.619
(Engine puttering)

11:26.685 --> 11:28.721
Oh, no,
we're out of gas!

11:30.623 --> 11:33.359
{\an3}BOTH:
Uh-oh!

11:34.226 --> 11:36.195
{\an3}(Coughing)

11:36.262 --> 11:37.463
Now what do we do?

11:37.530 --> 11:41.133
We have to
swim to that island.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.208
(All gasping)

11:49.275 --> 11:53.045
How are we going to get off this
island without our speedboat?

11:55.448 --> 11:58.017
I know!
We can make another boat.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.453
But we don't have any gas
for the motor.

12:00.519 --> 12:03.022
How are we going to
power the boat?

12:03.089 --> 12:05.091
(Wind blowing)

12:05.157 --> 12:07.193
We can make a sailboat.

12:07.259 --> 12:10.496
Yeah. The wind can push
our sailboat through the water

12:10.563 --> 12:12.231
all the way home.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.733
Okay, we need
three main parts.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.504
A bottom
that floats in water.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.872
That's where we sit,

12:19.939 --> 12:22.341
and it's the part
that floats on the water.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.977
It's called the hull.

12:25.044 --> 12:27.346
We also need a sail.

12:27.413 --> 12:31.550
The wind pushes the sail to
move the boat across the water.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.353
And we need a tall pole
to hold up the sail.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.921
That's called the mast.

12:35.988 --> 12:36.922
{\an5}I'll get the hull.

12:36.989 --> 12:40.493
I'll get a mast.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.928
And I'll find something
we can use for a sail.

12:42.995 --> 12:46.198
<i>And so the three islanders</i>
<i>went to find things</i>

12:46.265 --> 12:47.900
<i>to make their sailboat.</i>

12:47.967 --> 12:50.269
<i>Islander Gil</i>
<i>got the hull.</i>

12:50.336 --> 12:52.438
We can use this log
to sit on.

12:52.505 --> 12:53.506
(Barking)

12:53.572 --> 12:56.609
See? It floats.

12:56.675 --> 13:00.779
<i>When suddenly,</i>
<i>a very big monkey appeared.</i>

13:02.781 --> 13:05.084
Big monkey!

13:06.685 --> 13:09.388
<i>Meanwhile, on</i>
<i>the other side of the island,</i>

13:09.455 --> 13:11.690
<i>islander Goby</i>
<i>found a mast.</i>

13:11.757 --> 13:15.261
I can use one of these long
bamboo stalks to make a mast

13:15.327 --> 13:17.229
to hold the sail up.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.198
<i>When suddenly...</i>

13:19.265 --> 13:21.800
{\an3}Big monkey!

13:25.404 --> 13:27.706
<i>And on another part</i>
<i>of the island...</i>

13:27.773 --> 13:30.643
I can use one of these big
leaves to make a sail.

13:30.709 --> 13:34.180
<i>But before</i>
<i>she could get one...</i>

13:34.246 --> 13:36.682
{\an3}Big monkey!

13:41.987 --> 13:43.189
{\an3}There's a--
There's a--

13:43.255 --> 13:45.991
{\an1}I know!

13:43.255 --> 13:45.991
I saw it too!

13:46.058 --> 13:47.893
And I didn't
get the sail.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.196
We have to build our boat
and get out of here

13:50.262 --> 13:51.597
before that monkey
gets here.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.400
We have to
find a leaf, quick!

13:56.602 --> 13:57.603
We need your help.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.339
This shape has three sides.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.007
That means
it's a triangle.

14:02.074 --> 14:05.844
We need to find a leaf
shaped just like this.

14:05.911 --> 14:08.480
Which one of these leaves
has the same sides

14:08.547 --> 14:10.649
that we need
for our sail?

14:10.716 --> 14:13.852
This one, this one,
or this one?

14:17.957 --> 14:18.958
{\an1}That one!

14:19.024 --> 14:20.359
Right!

14:20.426 --> 14:23.929
This triangle has the right
kinds of sides that we need.

14:23.996 --> 14:28.267
<i>And so they built their</i>
<i>sailboat as fast as they could.</i>

14:28.334 --> 14:33.138
Let's get out of here.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.175
ALL:
Big monkey!

14:36.242 --> 14:38.677
Three big monkeys!

14:42.915 --> 14:45.217
Oh, we made it.

14:45.284 --> 14:49.121
And the wind's pushing our
sailboat back toward home.

14:49.188 --> 14:52.925
(Sobbing)

14:55.227 --> 14:57.263
I feel kind of bad.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.431
{\an3}Me too.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.701
Why are you guys crying?

15:02.768 --> 15:06.639
We want
to go on a boat too.

15:06.705 --> 15:10.175
Well, then,
why didn't you say so?

15:10.242 --> 15:11.977
(Exclaiming)

15:12.044 --> 15:14.480
<i>And so, the monkeys</i>
<i>and the islanders</i>

15:14.546 --> 15:17.983
<i>became good friends.</i>

15:18.050 --> 15:22.821
And they all lived
happily ever after.

15:22.888 --> 15:26.392
(Cheering)

15:26.458 --> 15:29.161
Come on, everybody,
