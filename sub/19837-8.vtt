00:04.120 --> 00:07.960
<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.120 --> 00:12.530
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.670 --> 00:18.530
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.420 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

02:01.500 --> 02:03.160
<b>One more!</b>

02:12.190 --> 02:14.190
<b>You just used your right hand!</b>

02:17.190 --> 02:19.010
<b>I did it!</b>

02:19.010 --> 02:21.940
<b>Hooray...</b>

02:28.000 --> 02:33.000
<b>Decision x By x Majority?</b>

02:34.470 --> 02:35.880
<b>Dawn breaks,</b>

02:35.880 --> 02:38.050
<b>as the airship carrying Gon and his friends</b>

02:38.050 --> 02:40.000
<b>approaches its destination.</b>

02:41.080 --> 02:44.380
<b>The Third Phase of the Hunter Exam 
is about to begin.</b>

02:48.810 --> 02:52.270
<b>I apologize for the long wait.</b>

02:52.270 --> 02:56.280
<b>The airship will soon arrive 
at its destination.</b>

02:56.280 --> 02:58.030
<b>Wow!</b>

02:58.030 --> 03:00.880
<b>Is that where the next test will be held?</b>

03:04.280 --> 03:06.050
<b>What is this place?</b>

03:06.050 --> 03:07.540
<b>There's nothing here.</b>

03:07.540 --> 03:09.040
<b>Ahem...</b>

03:09.460 --> 03:12.790
<b>Everyone, the exam's Third Phase 
will begin here,</b>

03:13.200 --> 03:16.410
<b>at the top of Trick Tower.</b>

03:16.410 --> 03:18.050
<b>Trick Tower?</b>

03:18.050 --> 03:19.680
<b>To pass this phase,</b>

03:19.680 --> 03:22.530
<b>you must reach the tower's base alive.</b>

03:23.060 --> 03:26.560
<b>The time limit is seventy-two hours.</b>

03:26.830 --> 03:30.310
<b>With that, we will now begin 
the Third Phase.</b>

03:30.530 --> 03:33.090
<b>I will pray for your success.</b>

03:30.930 --> 03:32.670
<b>No way.</b>

03:39.090 --> 03:41.280
<b>So it's finally my turn?</b>

03:52.470 --> 03:55.800
<b>Best of luck to everyone!</b>

04:00.170 --> 04:03.030
<b>Are we supposed to climb down?</b>

04:03.030 --> 04:05.160
<b>That would be suicide...</b>

04:06.820 --> 04:08.430
<b>Maybe for a normal person.</b>

04:12.650 --> 04:17.130
<b>But a top-class rock climber can 
handle this, no problem.</b>

04:17.690 --> 04:19.220
<b>Wow...</b>

04:19.220 --> 04:21.690
<b>He's going down pretty fast.</b>

04:22.820 --> 04:27.680
<b>Looks like I'll be the first one 
to pass the Third Phase...</b>

04:40.500 --> 04:41.920
<b>Stop! Stay away!</b>

04:43.530 --> 04:45.500
<b>Stop! Stop it!</b>

04:47.390 --> 04:49.230
<b>Help!</b>

04:52.650 --> 04:56.320
<b>G-Guess we can't climb down the side...</b>

04:57.250 --> 04:58.510
<b>Yeah.</b>

05:15.300 --> 05:16.250
<b>What's up?</b>

05:16.250 --> 05:17.980
<b>There are fewer people around.</b>

05:17.980 --> 05:19.000
<b>What?</b>

05:19.610 --> 05:21.430
<b>I count twenty-three,</b>

05:21.430 --> 05:24.730
<b>which suggests almost half of the 
applicants have already found an exit.</b>

05:26.010 --> 05:28.510
<b>No way. When did they do that?</b>

05:28.510 --> 05:30.660
<b>That means there must be</b>

05:30.660 --> 05:34.580
<b>some hidden doors that lead below.</b>

05:34.580 --> 05:37.300
<b>Kurapika! Leorio!</b>

05:38.760 --> 05:40.320
<b>What is it, Gon?</b>

05:40.320 --> 05:43.280
<b>Look. I found a hidden door.</b>

05:45.970 --> 05:47.490
<b>I see now.</b>

05:47.490 --> 05:50.800
<b>So we can descend by flipping the stones.</b>

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
<b>Okay!</b>

05:51.800 --> 05:52.950
<b>Great job, Gon!</b>

05:52.950 --> 05:54.540
<b>Let's head on down!</b>

05:54.540 --> 05:57.000
<b>But I'm confused.</b>

05:57.000 --> 05:59.290
<b>About what?</b>

05:59.290 --> 06:02.710
<b>There are also hidden doors here, 
there, over there,</b>

06:02.710 --> 06:05.670
<b>and over there, as well.</b>

06:05.670 --> 06:07.160
<b>That many?</b>

06:07.800 --> 06:11.180
<b>Five hidden doors, 
located in the same area.</b>

06:11.180 --> 06:13.100
<b>It sounds suspicious to me.</b>

06:13.100 --> 06:15.310
<b>Some could be traps.</b>

06:15.310 --> 06:16.990
<b>And it looks as though</b>

06:16.990 --> 06:19.670
<b>each door can only be used once...</b>

06:19.670 --> 06:21.060
<b>Seriously?</b>

06:22.070 --> 06:26.240
<b>We tried opening a door 
someone else used,</b>

06:26.240 --> 06:27.720
<b>but it wouldn't budge.</b>

06:29.070 --> 06:31.080
<b>Judging by the door's size,</b>

06:31.080 --> 06:33.810
<b>only one can fit at a time.</b>

06:33.810 --> 06:37.220
<b>In other words, only one person 
can use each door.</b>

06:37.220 --> 06:40.580
<b>We'll have to split up.</b>

06:40.580 --> 06:44.740
<b>Gon and I decided that we're each 
going to choose a door.</b>

06:44.740 --> 06:46.970
<b>No hard feelings if one 
of us springs a trap!</b>

06:46.970 --> 06:49.090
<b>What are you guys gonna do?</b>

06:49.090 --> 06:50.310
<b>I can live with that.</b>

06:50.310 --> 06:52.720
<b>Luck is part of the game...</b>

06:52.720 --> 06:54.500
<b>I have no objection.</b>

06:54.500 --> 06:56.100
<b>Then that settles it.</b>

06:59.410 --> 07:02.670
<b>Let's go, on the count of three.</b>

07:02.670 --> 07:05.610
<b>I guess this is goodbye for now.</b>

07:05.980 --> 07:07.860
<b>We'll meet up again, at the tower's base.</b>

07:08.240 --> 07:09.430
<b>Let's go...</b>

07:09.430 --> 07:10.490
<b>One!</b>

07:10.490 --> 07:11.740
<b>Two!</b>

07:11.740 --> 07:12.740
<b>Three!</b>

07:22.590 --> 07:23.290
<b>Huh?</b>

07:26.360 --> 07:28.180
<b>Huh? What?</b>

07:31.550 --> 07:33.940
<b>That was quite a brief farewell.</b>

07:33.940 --> 07:35.150
<b>Oh,</b>

07:35.150 --> 07:39.570
<b>so all the doors led to the same room...</b>

07:46.400 --> 07:48.320
<b>"The five of you</b>

07:48.320 --> 07:54.070
<b>must follow the will of the majority 
to reach the goal."</b>

07:54.070 --> 07:55.400
<b>Five of us?</b>

07:55.400 --> 07:58.330
<b>Look... There are five stopwatches.</b>

07:58.330 --> 08:01.330
<b>There's an O and an X button.</b>

08:01.330 --> 08:06.590
<b>Could it be that we won't be 
able to leave this room</b>

08:07.000 --> 08:09.580
<b>until another person drops in?</b>

08:10.340 --> 08:11.860
<b>That is correct!</b>

08:11.990 --> 08:12.720
<b>Who's that?!</b>

08:12.720 --> 08:15.040
<b>My name is Lippo.</b>

08:15.040 --> 08:16.550
<b>I am the prison warden here,</b>

08:16.550 --> 08:19.180
<b>as well as the Third Phase examiner.</b>

08:19.180 --> 08:21.060
<b>Prison warden?</b>

08:21.540 --> 08:25.560
<b>Multiple routes through this tower 
have been prepared.</b>

08:25.560 --> 08:28.940
<b>You have chosen the path 
of majority rule.</b>

08:29.420 --> 08:30.680
<b>Cooperation will be key</b>

08:30.680 --> 08:34.450
<b>if you wish to clear this 
phase of the exam.</b>

08:34.450 --> 08:38.920
<b>One person's selfish behavior 
can derail an entire group.</b>

08:38.920 --> 08:42.800
<b>And you can't start until you 
have five members.</b>

08:43.460 --> 08:45.830
<b>Best of luck, gentlemen!</b>

08:48.730 --> 08:52.070
<b>We can't move on until 
someone else arrives?</b>

08:52.070 --> 08:53.570
<b>What do we do?</b>

08:53.570 --> 08:56.130
<b>We have to wait, I guess...</b>

09:11.000 --> 09:13.070
<b>Did you need something, warden?</b>

09:13.610 --> 09:15.260
<b>The test begins now.</b>

09:15.260 --> 09:17.570
<b>Take your assigned positions.</b>

09:17.570 --> 09:19.560
<b>Okay.</b>

09:28.030 --> 09:30.040
<b>Oh, come on!</b>

09:30.590 --> 09:32.960
<b>It's been two hours...</b>

09:32.960 --> 09:36.970
<b>What if the others all took 
different routes?</b>

09:36.970 --> 09:40.720
<b>Only a fool would still be at 
the top of the tower!</b>

09:40.720 --> 09:42.510
<b>Calm down, Leorio.</b>

09:42.510 --> 09:43.970
<b>Complaining won't help.</b>

09:43.970 --> 09:45.080
<b>But...</b>

09:45.080 --> 09:48.480
<b>What if no one shows up before 
we reach our time limit?</b>

09:48.730 --> 09:49.710
<b>Hey!</b>

09:50.480 --> 09:51.640
<b>I can't just sit here and...</b>

09:51.640 --> 09:53.070
<b>Quiet!</b>

09:53.070 --> 09:54.020
<b>Huh?</b>

09:54.670 --> 09:55.990
<b>That sound...</b>

10:11.920 --> 10:13.750
<b>Good grief...</b>

10:13.750 --> 10:15.360
<b>Tonpa-san.</b>

10:15.360 --> 10:16.770
<b>Oh.</b>

10:16.770 --> 10:18.460
<b>It's the old man.</b>

10:21.510 --> 10:22.850
<b>Okay!</b>

10:29.380 --> 10:30.610
<b>I see.</b>

10:30.610 --> 10:32.850
<b>So the door appears</b>

10:32.850 --> 10:35.030
<b>once five people arrive and 
put on the stopwatches.</b>

10:35.030 --> 10:39.530
<b>"At this door, select 
O to open, X not to open."</b>

10:39.530 --> 10:41.970
<b>Forcing us to use majority rule already?</b>

10:41.970 --> 10:44.540
<b>The answer should be obvious...</b>

10:46.390 --> 10:47.790
<b>What?</b>

10:48.170 --> 10:51.250
<b>Who pushed the X button?</b>

10:52.010 --> 10:54.000
<b>Sorry, that was me.</b>

10:54.000 --> 10:55.550
<b>I pressed the wrong button 
by mistake.</b>

10:56.040 --> 10:58.640
<b>Stop screwing around, old man!</b>

10:58.640 --> 11:00.680
<b>Are you blind?</b>

11:00.680 --> 11:02.900
<b>Like I said, it was an accident.</b>

11:02.900 --> 11:05.870
<b>How can you accidentally press 
the wrong button?!</b>

11:06.810 --> 11:08.010
<b>It doesn't matter.</b>

11:08.010 --> 11:09.980
<b>The door opened.</b>

11:09.980 --> 11:11.600
<b>No, it does matter!</b>

11:11.600 --> 11:14.820
<b>This guy deliberately pressed 
the wrong button...</b>

11:14.820 --> 11:15.680
<b>Let's go.</b>

11:15.680 --> 11:17.510
<b>We don't have time to bicker.</b>

11:17.510 --> 11:19.000
<b>That's right...</b>

11:19.000 --> 11:22.180
<b>Even if he keeps pressing 
the wrong one,</b>

11:22.180 --> 11:24.870
<b>the rest of us just need to 
press the right one.</b>

11:27.430 --> 11:28.610
<b>Fine.</b>

11:29.970 --> 11:31.390
<b>Okay, let's go!</b>

11:31.390 --> 11:33.440
<b>Damn...</b>

11:34.800 --> 11:36.010
<b>Seriously...</b>

11:36.010 --> 11:38.840
<b>Another question so soon?</b>

11:38.840 --> 11:40.600
<b>"Which way do you want to go?</b>

11:40.600 --> 11:43.340
<b>O for right. X for left."</b>

11:45.420 --> 11:46.640
<b>Right...</b>

11:48.540 --> 11:50.100
<b>Or left...</b>

11:53.080 --> 11:54.100
<b>Huh?!</b>

11:54.100 --> 11:56.700
<b>Wh-Why would you choose to go right?</b>

11:56.700 --> 11:58.860
<b>Normally, you should go left...</b>

11:58.860 --> 12:00.260
<b>That is true.</b>

12:00.260 --> 12:05.030
<b>Studies have indicated that people 
who are lost or stuck at forks</b>

12:05.030 --> 12:08.240
<b>unconsciously tend to go left.</b>

12:08.240 --> 12:10.620
<b>I've heard that before, too.</b>

12:10.960 --> 12:14.200
<b>Wait! The numbers don't add up!</b>

12:14.200 --> 12:16.380
<b>Which button did you press?</b>

12:16.570 --> 12:17.300
<b>Right.</b>

12:17.590 --> 12:18.480
<b>Right.</b>

12:18.860 --> 12:21.380
<b>Y-You guys...</b>

12:21.380 --> 12:23.740
<b>That's why they chose to go right...</b>

12:23.740 --> 12:26.270
<b>To outfox the examiner.</b>

12:26.270 --> 12:29.170
<b>If the examiner knows that 
people tend to go left,</b>

12:29.170 --> 12:31.890
<b>the left path will be more difficult.</b>

12:35.740 --> 12:37.900
<b>So we're just simple-minded!</b>

12:37.900 --> 12:39.000
<b>We?</b>

12:51.660 --> 12:54.180
<b>Wh-What is this place?</b>

12:57.970 --> 12:59.670
<b>Look over there.</b>

13:04.140 --> 13:05.980
<b>The applicants have arrived.</b>

13:05.980 --> 13:07.930
<b>Remove the shackles.</b>

13:12.130 --> 13:13.740
<b>Jeez...</b>

13:21.080 --> 13:24.220
<b>I'm finally free.</b>

13:31.100 --> 13:41.170
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

13:37.000 --> 13:41.170
<b>Tonpa</b>

13:45.550 --> 13:47.430
<b>Allow me to explain, gentlemen.</b>

13:48.300 --> 13:53.680
<b>Before you are some of 
Trick Tower's prisoners.</b>

13:53.680 --> 13:55.180
<b>Prisoners?</b>

13:55.740 --> 13:58.330
<b>The Hunter Exam Committee</b>

13:58.330 --> 14:02.140
<b>has also officially hired them 
as examiners.</b>

14:02.820 --> 14:06.890
<b>You will be fighting against 
the five of them.</b>

14:07.570 --> 14:09.470
<b>The fights will be one-on-one.</b>

14:09.470 --> 14:11.850
<b>Each person may only fight once.</b>

14:12.450 --> 14:14.410
<b>You are free to use any method you like.</b>

14:14.410 --> 14:16.080
<b>There will be no draws.</b>

14:16.080 --> 14:19.020
<b>A win is declared when the 
opponent admits defeat.</b>

14:20.460 --> 14:23.970
<b>You may pick your order.</b>

14:23.970 --> 14:25.960
<b>It's majority rule.</b>

14:25.960 --> 14:29.470
<b>So secure three wins, and you may pass.</b>

14:29.830 --> 14:32.030
<b>The rules are simple.</b>

14:32.030 --> 14:32.770
<b>Tsk...</b>

14:32.770 --> 14:34.820
<b>Majority rule again?</b>

14:34.820 --> 14:37.480
<b>Well, I prefer straightforward rules.</b>

14:38.310 --> 14:41.230
<b>However, the actual fights will 
not be quite so simple.</b>

14:42.040 --> 14:44.230
<b>The prisoners' sentences will be reduced</b>

14:44.230 --> 14:48.420
<b>by one year, for every hour they 
delay the applicants here.</b>

14:49.060 --> 14:53.250
<b>In other words, their goal 
is also to buy time.</b>

14:53.740 --> 14:55.500
<b>I understand...</b>

14:55.500 --> 15:01.250
<b>And we must reach the goal 
within seventy-two hours.</b>

15:01.250 --> 15:05.270
<b>So time will be critical during these fights.</b>

15:09.230 --> 15:12.300
<b>Okay, I'm up first.</b>

15:09.280 --> 15:13.760
<b>Bendot 
199-year sentence, robbery and murder</b>

15:12.300 --> 15:13.760
<b>Choose your combatant!</b>

15:13.760 --> 15:15.250
<b>What should we do?</b>

15:15.250 --> 15:17.420
<b>He said that we can fight 
with any method.</b>

15:17.420 --> 15:20.020
<b>So that means anything goes.</b>

15:20.020 --> 15:23.270
<b>We don't know what they'll try to pull...</b>

15:23.610 --> 15:25.650
<b>There's too much at stake without knowing</b>

15:25.650 --> 15:27.750
<b>what they have up their sleeves.</b>

15:27.750 --> 15:28.900
<b>Given that, I shall...</b>

15:28.900 --> 15:30.400
<b>No, I'll go!</b>

15:31.910 --> 15:33.340
<b>Tonpa-san?</b>

15:33.910 --> 15:35.650
<b>I'll act as a guinea pig,</b>

15:35.650 --> 15:38.240
<b>so we can discover what they're up to.</b>

15:38.240 --> 15:40.410
<b>Consider this an apology for before.</b>

15:40.410 --> 15:42.790
<b>Hey, are you serious?</b>

15:42.790 --> 15:43.850
<b>Sure.</b>

15:43.850 --> 15:48.300
<b>Plus, you guys don't actually 
trust me, right?</b>

15:48.300 --> 15:54.730
<b>Do you really want me to be the tiebreaker, 
when the score is 2-2?</b>

15:54.730 --> 15:56.930
<b>You have a point...</b>

15:56.930 --> 15:59.430
<b>Then it's settled.</b>

15:59.430 --> 16:02.190
<b>Tonpa, you're...</b>

16:25.960 --> 16:28.300
<b>Th-That was a surprise...</b>

16:28.300 --> 16:30.490
<b>I didn't expect Tonpa to volunteer.</b>

16:30.490 --> 16:33.720
<b>He called himself a guinea pig.</b>

16:33.720 --> 16:36.510
<b>Will Tonpa-san be okay?</b>

16:39.250 --> 16:42.980
<b>Now, let us determine the 
method of combat.</b>

16:43.420 --> 16:46.230
<b>I propose a death match.</b>

16:47.230 --> 16:48.660
<b>A death match?</b>

16:48.660 --> 16:51.310
<b>They fight until one dies?</b>

16:51.310 --> 16:52.490
<b>No...</b>

16:52.870 --> 16:55.010
<b>Don't let him provoke you!</b>

16:55.520 --> 16:57.240
<b>Well?</b>

16:58.480 --> 16:59.940
<b>Very well...</b>

16:59.940 --> 17:02.250
<b>I accept!</b>

17:02.250 --> 17:03.330
<b>Huh?</b>

17:03.330 --> 17:04.750
<b>Seriously?</b>

17:05.110 --> 17:07.500
<b>I commend you for your courage!</b>

17:37.030 --> 17:38.690
<b>T-Tonpa...</b>

17:39.620 --> 17:41.910
<b>Let the fight begin!</b>

17:50.320 --> 17:51.340
<b>I...</b>

17:51.340 --> 17:53.840
<b>I give!</b>

17:53.840 --> 17:54.700
<b>Huh?</b>

17:55.900 --> 17:56.690
<b>What?</b>

18:00.850 --> 18:04.750
<b>Did he just give up?</b>

18:04.750 --> 18:08.150
<b>M-Maybe he meant "Give me a sec"?</b>

18:09.100 --> 18:11.440
<b>What did you just say?</b>

18:11.440 --> 18:15.060
<b>You win if I admit defeat, right?</b>

18:15.060 --> 18:15.990
<b>I give up...</b>

18:15.990 --> 18:17.300
<b>I lose!</b>

18:18.610 --> 18:21.450
<b>Wha... Wha... Wha...</b>

18:26.900 --> 18:28.310
<b>All right...</b>

18:28.310 --> 18:30.710
<b>I win this round.</b>

18:31.900 --> 18:36.220
<b>If we win two more rounds, you lose.</b>

18:36.220 --> 18:39.680
<b>You won't be able to advance or turn back.</b>

18:39.680 --> 18:45.240
<b>You'll be stuck here until the 
seventy-two hours are up.</b>

18:45.240 --> 18:46.510
<b>Should that come to pass,</b>

18:46.510 --> 18:51.230
<b>our sentences will be reduced 
by seventy-two years.</b>

18:54.230 --> 18:56.420
<b>Man, that was a disgrace.</b>

18:56.420 --> 18:59.240
<b>He looked a lot stronger up close...</b>

18:59.240 --> 19:00.490
<b>Bastard...</b>

19:01.480 --> 19:03.740
<b>You just confirmed all my suspicions!</b>

19:03.740 --> 19:07.080
<b>You're a worthless piece of trash,</b>

19:07.080 --> 19:09.250
<b>who's only good for sabotaging 
other applicants!</b>

19:09.250 --> 19:11.040
<b>Exactly.</b>

19:11.040 --> 19:13.260
<b>That's what I do every year.</b>

19:13.260 --> 19:16.390
<b>And I plan to continue the tradition.</b>

19:16.390 --> 19:18.010
<b>Wh-What?</b>

19:18.410 --> 19:22.470
<b>I'm not looking to pass the Hunter Exam.</b>

19:22.470 --> 19:24.010
<b>I'm only in it for the thrills.</b>

19:24.010 --> 19:25.880
<b>The thrills?</b>

19:25.880 --> 19:27.020
<b>Yes.</b>

19:28.020 --> 19:30.920
<b>The Hunter Exam is a trial meant</b>

19:30.920 --> 19:33.530
<b>to crush confident young people's dreams.</b>

19:33.530 --> 19:37.690
<b>The moment of despair, 
when ambition and hope give way,</b>

19:38.260 --> 19:42.660
<b>gives me a sense of exquisite pleasure.</b>

19:43.310 --> 19:49.250
<b>Especially when I'm actively 
shattering these rookies' dreams.</b>

19:50.120 --> 19:54.050
<b>I don't plan on becoming a Hunter.</b>

19:54.700 --> 19:57.130
<b>I've already had enough fun this year.</b>

19:57.550 --> 20:00.880
<b>It's time for me to bow out.</b>

20:01.260 --> 20:02.280
<b>You bastard...</b>

20:02.280 --> 20:03.390
<b>Stop, Leorio!</b>

20:03.390 --> 20:04.490
<b>But...</b>

20:06.250 --> 20:10.140
<b>They want us to waste our time, 
fighting amongst ourselves.</b>

20:12.120 --> 20:13.150
<b>However,</b>

20:13.150 --> 20:16.350
<b>if their goal is to buy time,</b>

20:16.890 --> 20:19.260
<b>then the old man made 
the correct choice.</b>

20:19.260 --> 20:20.400
<b>Huh?</b>

20:20.840 --> 20:22.370
<b>That bald guy is probably</b>

20:22.370 --> 20:24.910
<b>a former soldier or mercenary.</b>

20:24.910 --> 20:26.580
<b>Had you fought him,</b>

20:26.580 --> 20:28.890
<b>he would have started by 
crushing your throat,</b>

20:28.890 --> 20:31.410
<b>so you couldn't have given up.</b>

20:32.040 --> 20:34.760
<b>Then he would have tortured you, 
without killing you,</b>

20:34.760 --> 20:36.960
<b>for the rest of the remaining time...</b>

20:37.820 --> 20:40.810
<b>Th-That was one of the possibilities 
I took into consideration...</b>

20:41.380 --> 20:43.180
<b>You look sick.</b>

20:43.180 --> 20:46.210
<b>My plan was disrupted.</b>

20:46.210 --> 20:50.910
<b>I was going to take my time, 
punishing him...</b>

20:50.910 --> 20:53.140
<b>Don't worry. Everything will be fine.</b>

20:56.210 --> 21:00.670
<b>Sedokan 
149-year sentence, serial bombings</b>

20:57.370 --> 20:59.850
<b>If we defeat two of the remaining four,</b>

20:59.850 --> 21:01.390
<b>then we win.</b>

21:02.190 --> 21:07.620
<b>Regardless, we need to win 
three rounds and advance.</b>

21:07.620 --> 21:09.200
<b>Who's going next?</b>

21:09.200 --> 21:11.950
<b>Me! I'll go!</b>

21:13.850 --> 21:14.930
<b>Are you sure?</b>

21:14.930 --> 21:16.210
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

21:16.210 --> 21:20.210
<b>The next opponent doesn't 
look too strong.</b>

21:20.210 --> 21:22.840
<b>But you can't let your guard down.</b>

21:22.840 --> 21:25.940
<b>He's still a criminal.</b>

21:25.940 --> 21:27.660
<b>Uh-huh, I know.</b>

21:33.300 --> 21:35.260
<b>Tonpa's actions</b>

21:35.260 --> 21:38.540
<b>have placed Gon and his friends 
at a disadvantage.</b>

21:38.540 --> 21:40.460
<b>What is their next opponent,</b>

21:40.460 --> 21:45.740
<b>Sedokan, planning to do in this match?</b>

21:48.430 --> 21:50.330
<b>At the start of the Hunter Exam's Third Phase,</b>

21:50.330 --> 21:52.170
<b>there were 40 applicants.</b>

21:52.170 --> 21:54.540
<b>With 1 eliminated,</b>

21:54.540 --> 21:57.210
<b>only 39 remain.</b>

23:28.260 --> 23:30.590
<b>Next time: Beware x Of x Prisoners.</b>

23:30.590 --> 23:32.560
<b>And watch your back!</b>

23:32.560 --> 23:34.290
<b>Be careful when you're out late.</b>
