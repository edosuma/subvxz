00:01.202 --> 00:05.673
(intro to "Burning Down the
House" by Talking Heads plays)

00:11.479 --> 00:13.247
* Ah...

00:13.281 --> 00:15.416
(singing along with music):
* Watch out

00:15.449 --> 00:17.585
* You might get
what you're after *

00:17.618 --> 00:19.087
* Cool babies

00:20.288 --> 00:22.723
* Strange but not a stranger

00:22.756 --> 00:27.828
* I'm an ordinary guy

00:27.861 --> 00:29.497
* Burning down the house

00:29.530 --> 00:30.764
(bird calling)

00:30.798 --> 00:32.366
NIKKI: No, seriously.
Seriously, I can get you

00:32.400 --> 00:33.701
whatever you need, all right?

00:33.734 --> 00:35.669
GhostCredit.com-- check it out.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.440
DON (over radio):
Those two aren't on the list.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.075
NIKKI:
Low-level players.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.676
Yeah, well, keep looking.
And David-- where is he?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.312
LIZ:
He's in the lobby making a sale.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.379
DON:
Give me audio.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.115
DAVID (over radio):
Classic: $12.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.416
Visa Gold: $14.50.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.384
MasterCard: $19.50.

00:50.418 --> 00:52.286
American Express: $36 a pop.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.288
Being invisible to the man--

00:54.322 --> 00:55.523
that's priceless.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.259
And I can discount you guys
if you buy more than a hundred.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.394
Uh, we also have, uh,
ATM skimmers,

01:00.428 --> 01:02.296
uh, bank PIN numbers.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.465
GhostCredit.com.

01:04.498 --> 01:08.469
* Fighting fire with fire

01:08.502 --> 01:11.139
* Ah, all wet

01:11.172 --> 01:13.341
* Yeah, you might
need a raincoat *

01:13.374 --> 01:15.809
* Shakedown

01:15.843 --> 01:18.846
* Dreams walking
in broad daylight... *

01:18.879 --> 01:20.248
One-stop shopping, fellas.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.382
What do you want?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.684
DON (over radio): David,
possible match. Close the deal.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.853
Nikki, keep your eyes open.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.322
He should be heading upstairs.

01:28.356 --> 01:31.325
* Sometimes I listen to myself

01:31.359 --> 01:33.494
* Going to come in first place

01:33.527 --> 01:35.563
For a legitimate computer
conference, there's a lot

01:35.596 --> 01:37.331
of criminal activity out here.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.666
- How's it going?
- DON: Hey.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.435
LIZ: Well, we got seven or eight
good arrests so far,

01:41.469 --> 01:42.670
but The Fist still
hasn't shown up yet.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.405
DON:
Well, let's be sure.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.673
(chuckling): The Fist.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.541
What an online name.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.544
CHARLIE: You know, this guy's
got to be scrawny with backne.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.347
* Burning down the house

01:53.381 --> 01:54.682
I don't want
to underestimate him, Charlie.

01:54.715 --> 01:55.816
Last year, his black market

01:55.849 --> 01:57.551
pulled down millions
in identity theft.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.187
We still don't know who he is

01:59.220 --> 02:00.388
or what he looks like.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.790
* Everything's
stuck together... *

02:02.823 --> 02:04.492
(applause, whistling)

02:04.525 --> 02:06.760
- DON: Here we go.
- CHARLIE: Okay, now,

02:06.794 --> 02:08.629
The Fist is meeting David

02:08.662 --> 02:10.231
at Amita's talk, right,
so he's somewhere

02:10.264 --> 02:11.565
- in that crowd?
- LIZ: Should I go in?

02:11.599 --> 02:13.534
Yeah, but hold back
till I say, all right?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.269
- Then tail him?
- Uh-huh.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.737
Wait, uh...

02:16.770 --> 02:18.339
why tail him?

02:18.372 --> 02:19.907
I thought he was buying
a truckload of 3-D printers

02:19.940 --> 02:21.375
- from David.
- Still want to I.D. him,

02:21.409 --> 02:22.743
even if it doesn't go down.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.946
AMITA: More and more,
we live in virtual worlds.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.216
Not only those of us
who are gamers,

02:28.249 --> 02:29.517
but all of us.
(beep)

02:29.550 --> 02:31.385
* Transportation is here
* Here

02:31.419 --> 02:34.355
* Close enough,
but not too far *

02:34.388 --> 02:36.857
* Maybe you know where you are

02:36.890 --> 02:38.559
* Fightin' fire...

02:38.592 --> 02:40.828
With holograms
and 3-D technology,

02:40.861 --> 02:43.631
imaginary worlds
are becoming more lifelike,

02:43.664 --> 02:45.766
blurring the boundaries
between

02:45.799 --> 02:47.935
reality and fantasy.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.404
This machine works
in the opposite direction,

02:50.438 --> 02:53.774
taking what is virtual--
an image on a computer--

02:53.807 --> 02:56.444
and making it real
just by hitting "Print."

02:56.477 --> 02:57.711
AMITA: This is the disruptive
technology...

02:57.745 --> 02:59.213
Whoa, whoa...
Charlie. Is that Dad?

02:59.247 --> 03:00.514
CHARLIE:
I told him not to come.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.915
DON:
Just deal with him.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.517
AMITA:
It views 3-D

03:03.551 --> 03:06.420
objects as 2-D slices...
(door opens, shuts)

03:06.454 --> 03:08.222
...using powders or plastics

03:08.256 --> 03:11.459
to print the slices one atop
the other to build an object.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.594
The applications
are almost endless.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.429
(knock on door)
MAN: Augie, you're up.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.367
(inhales deeply, grunts)

03:20.501 --> 03:22.303
- Hey.
- ALAN: Hey.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.971
- What are you doing here?
- Charlie.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.274
This is Kath Berry,
president of Phrizz Software.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.475
She's my boss.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.709
Dr. Eppes,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.911
it's an absolute thrill
to meet you.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.980
Thank you. Thanks.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.748
Why is it called PenTest?
What does that mean?

03:34.782 --> 03:36.284
It's Pen...
it's Penetration Testers.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.919
When I was growing up,
we used to call that dating.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.788
(Alan chuckles)

03:40.821 --> 03:43.891
Cyber-hackers who test systems
by attacking them.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.926
- Legally?
- Well, a lot of these guys

03:45.959 --> 03:47.361
switch between
white hat hacking

03:47.395 --> 03:49.297
and black hat hacking.
But listen--

03:49.330 --> 03:51.465
no matter what you see
in the next few minutes,

03:51.499 --> 03:52.633
just play it cool.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.001
What do you mean?

03:54.034 --> 03:56.604
AMITA: ...we have to protect
against, as this

03:56.637 --> 03:59.640
technology falls in the hands of
criminal enterprises.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.609
3-D printing can be used

04:01.642 --> 04:03.644
for reproducing keys
from photographs,

04:03.677 --> 04:06.614
reproducing credit cards,
creating stamps

04:06.647 --> 04:08.048
to emboss fake documents

04:08.081 --> 04:09.883
like passports
or government bonds,

04:09.917 --> 04:11.352
counterfeiting money,

04:11.385 --> 04:12.886
creating fake fingerprints...

04:12.920 --> 04:13.821
There's...

04:13.854 --> 04:16.023
- Look. That's...
- Yeah, I know. I know.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.659
Oh. I got it.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.827
What's going on?

04:19.860 --> 04:20.894
FBI business.

04:20.928 --> 04:21.995
(laughs)

04:22.029 --> 04:24.532
We need your silent cooperation.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.936
AMITA:
I designed this dagger

04:28.969 --> 04:30.838
for my gaming fantasy.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.507
(computers chirping)

04:34.442 --> 04:37.010
(buzzing)

04:37.044 --> 04:39.547
3-D printing
can make real weapons

04:39.580 --> 04:41.549
able to pass
through metal detectors.

04:41.582 --> 04:45.085
Like all progressive technology
throughout history,

04:45.118 --> 04:47.921
this one has its upsides
and its downsides:

04:47.955 --> 04:49.523
Counterfeiting money,

04:49.557 --> 04:51.759
- creating fake fingerprints...
- DON: I got him.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.061
White guy on the couch,
green hat.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.397
AMITA: And we have to be aware
of its possibilities

04:56.430 --> 04:57.998
as it enters our lives
every day.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.900
CHARLIE: All right,
let's go get her. Come on.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.007
PENTEST HOST:
Dr. Amita Ramanujan!

05:07.040 --> 05:09.109
Excellent,
provocative presentation

05:09.142 --> 05:10.844
from the hottest nerd

05:10.878 --> 05:12.813
in the house.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.783
Buy one of these, put it on,
get her to sign it, man.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.451
Get her to touch your body.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.988
Next, we have a
PenTest favorite.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.091
Augie Harris, intrepid hacker,
come to tell us

05:24.124 --> 05:25.959
about the death of the magnetic
strip.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.427
Liz, stay with him.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.362
HOST:
Augie!

05:28.396 --> 05:30.698
(crowd applauding)

05:31.899 --> 05:33.801
Nikki, get back to the truck.

05:38.539 --> 05:41.141
AUGIE: Dudes, have I got
a surprise for you.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.044
Traitors walk among us--
I kid you not.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.913
See the movie, buy the T-shirt.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.848
PenTest brothers and sisters,

05:47.881 --> 05:51.519
we have been infiltrated
by the FBI:

05:51.552 --> 05:53.954
Funded But Incompetent.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.725
Big, bad Agent Sinclair,

05:57.758 --> 06:00.027
smokin' hot Agents Warner

06:00.060 --> 06:01.995
and Betancourt,
they are running a bogus

06:02.029 --> 06:04.064
- David, Liz.
- credit card market...

06:04.097 --> 06:06.066
AUGIE:
GhostCredit.com.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.468
It is a sting.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.036
Nikki, grab this jackass.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.939
AUGIE: If you've bought
from either of these two,

06:11.972 --> 06:14.074
game over, thanks for playing.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.075
Turn around.

06:15.108 --> 06:15.976
Whoa. Usually,
I make the first move, but this

06:16.009 --> 06:17.878
is cool. I'm Augie.
(handcuffs click)

06:19.179 --> 06:21.782
(rhythmic beeping starts,
then stops)

06:21.815 --> 06:22.716
What'd you do?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.685
That wasn't supposed to happen.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.119
(gunshots)

06:33.561 --> 06:35.663
(tires screeching)

06:51.745 --> 06:53.180
Hey.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.414
- Anything?
- In the wind.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.884
Killed the valet, jacked the
car, dumped it five miles away.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.519
Now, why does
a credit card scammer

06:58.552 --> 06:59.720
move up to first-degree murder?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.889
Obviously, there's more going on
than we know about, right?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.156
- Where are we going?
- There.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.558
He's The Fist, right?

07:04.592 --> 07:06.226
DAVID: Yeah, looks like it--
we're no closer

07:06.259 --> 07:08.195
to his real identity than when
we started this operation.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.864
How long have we been putting
this thing together?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.199
Not as long as I'm going
to be answering for it.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.000
This is what I found

07:13.033 --> 07:14.868
on the GhostCredit.com
Web site.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.169
"Pwned"? What's that?

07:16.203 --> 07:18.906
"Pwned." It means,
"You are owned."

07:18.939 --> 07:21.008
DAVID: Why say "pwned"
if you mean "owned"?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.510
Started as typo,

07:22.543 --> 07:24.912
became an inside joke
called "leetspeak,"

07:24.945 --> 07:26.747
as in elite computer shorthand

07:26.780 --> 07:28.749
for crackers and hackers
using symbols,

07:28.782 --> 07:30.618
numbers, letters, words, memes.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.552
So, what does it mean?

07:31.585 --> 07:32.620
Means someone's taken over
the Web site.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.522
It means we no longer
have any control over it.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.757
And I would guess
he knows something about it.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.626
Yeah, why don't you
get on that, huh?

07:38.659 --> 07:39.727
Wh-What... what's up with Dad?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.028
What was he doing here?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.497
Oh, you know, I guess
his boss insisted, and...

07:43.531 --> 07:44.732
She's kind of...

07:44.765 --> 07:46.233
I think she's hot.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.068
I was going to say
she's assertive, but yeah,

07:48.101 --> 07:49.169
she's pretty...
she's pretty hot.

07:49.202 --> 07:49.837
(phone rings)

07:49.870 --> 07:51.004
I sent them home with Amita.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.673
Ah, great. The ASAC.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.674
All right, look...

07:53.707 --> 07:55.008
call me, all right?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.746
August Harris, known hacker.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.614
Augie.

08:00.648 --> 08:01.949
How did you get our pictures?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.618
I infiltrated the FBI database.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.955
Carding sites are notorious
for rippers, cheats and Feds.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.757
Who do you work for, Augie?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.224
Myself.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.626
DAVID:
Right.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.029
Did this man here pay you
to do this?

08:16.063 --> 08:18.298
I run my own network.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.100
Uh, actually,
I believe I run all four

08:20.133 --> 08:21.869
major carding networks
at the moment.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.804
You took over

08:23.837 --> 08:25.138
four illegal markets
at the same time?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.006
Yeah.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.309
That would require
a lot of planning.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.678
(whooshing)

08:30.711 --> 08:32.279
A lot of power.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.682
Yeah, uh, the electrical failure
was not part of my plan.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.150
I really need to assess
my hardware upstairs.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.552
DAVID:
Check that out.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.187
I'll be down here.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.662
How'd you get
all this in here?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.798
I had to tip the hell
out of the bellboy.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.666
Hey, could you just
undo my hands here

08:52.700 --> 08:53.834
- so I can...?
- No.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.035
- AUGIE: Really?
- NIKKI: Really.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.304
AUGIE: I'm a valuable
asset to the FBI.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.039
- NIKKI: Really?
- AUGIE: Really.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.308
You'll see.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.043
CHARLIE: So, this setup drained
the power from the rest

09:03.076 --> 09:05.746
of the hotel, and it never...
never went off-line?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.014
Yeah, battery backup.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.749
Um, could you just push "Return"

09:08.782 --> 09:10.117
on that one right...
right here?

09:10.150 --> 09:11.284
CHARLIE:
No, that could be a command

09:11.318 --> 09:13.687
to... to blow up
this whole hotel,

09:13.721 --> 09:15.055
or some kind of kill switch
or something, right?

09:15.088 --> 09:16.757
No, don't touch anything
in this room.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.758
(Augie chuckling)

09:17.791 --> 09:19.092
No, you don't understand, man.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.994
Look at the screen
at the end there.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.696
I'm not into explosives.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.697
(trilling)

09:28.702 --> 09:30.137
You really did this.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.905
You're really controlling

09:31.939 --> 09:34.274
four illegal credit card markets
from this room,

09:34.307 --> 09:35.976
including the FBI sting site.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.879
Best hacker in the world.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.113
You've got international

09:40.147 --> 09:41.348
criminal cartels after you now.

09:41.381 --> 09:42.716
Yeah, I know.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.886
Why do you think
I let you catch me?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.255
I'm safe in your hands,
Agent Betancourt.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.623
Can I call you Nikki?

09:49.657 --> 09:50.791
Nicola?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.325
You want to check out my loft?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.638
DAVID:
Augie Harris hijacked

10:04.672 --> 10:06.707
four underground online markets,

10:06.740 --> 10:07.941
all at the same time.

10:07.975 --> 10:11.812
The Eastern Europeans
who sell PIN numbers,

10:11.845 --> 10:14.014
credit cards, Social Security
numbers, skimmers...

10:14.047 --> 10:17.117
Weedy Luzon's Filipino
counterfeiting cartel...

10:17.150 --> 10:19.853
An Israeli group
run by The Fist.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.122
DON: This is the guy
we're thinking slipped out?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.658
DAVID:
Yeah, and our sting market.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.826
Who is this kid?

10:25.859 --> 10:27.661
LIZ: Augie Harris has
been operating

10:27.695 --> 10:29.196
a small-time market called Ooze.

10:29.229 --> 10:30.998
DAVID: Yeah, smart guy,
dropped out of MIT.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.767
But nobody figured
he had the sack for this.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.769
Yeah, what he did was
he exploited a weakness

10:35.803 --> 10:37.437
in the basic structure
of the Internet.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.673
It's the domain
name system, DNS.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.108
It's a directory assistance
for Web sites.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.743
It's been around
since the early '80s.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.878
It's primitive,
but it's trusting.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.847
It's kind of like
the U.S. Postal system.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.181
Kind of.

10:48.215 --> 10:51.885
When a person wants mail
forwarded to a new address,

10:51.919 --> 10:53.887
he simply needs
one canceled letter

10:53.921 --> 10:55.689
with his name
and old address on it

10:55.723 --> 10:56.890
as proof he lives there.

10:56.924 --> 10:57.991
People move so often

10:58.025 --> 11:00.894
that it would be impossible
to verify each change,

11:00.928 --> 11:03.731
so the system is trusting-- it
requires very little evidence

11:03.764 --> 11:05.232
before rerouting the mail.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.068
Augie created fake pages
to mirror these Web sites--

11:08.101 --> 11:10.237
which easily fooled
the domain name system--

11:10.270 --> 11:12.305
and then he made
a change of address,

11:12.339 --> 11:15.475
which funneled every transaction
into his site.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.477
Now, as long as his site's
still active,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.312
the cartels are going
to hack him back.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.981
Yeah, they're, they're
losing big money.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.084
We could adapt the sting program
to I.D. those attackers,

11:24.117 --> 11:24.885
get locations.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.486
DON: We're
gonna have to move fast.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.756
They'll try it for a day,
but they'll put up new ones.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.990
CHARLIE: I need to check out
Augie's setup,

11:30.023 --> 11:32.292
and there may be
a kill switch on it,

11:32.325 --> 11:34.327
so this will go a lot faster
if he works with us.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.829
Well, can we trust him?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.231
Let's find out.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.267
I don't understand why Augie
let himself get caught.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.002
This kid could've gotten rich.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.237
Listen, all he cares
about is the hack.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.139
I mean, he pierced

11:46.173 --> 11:49.977
military-grade encryptions
on four sites at the same time,

11:50.010 --> 11:51.945
including the FBI's.

11:51.979 --> 11:53.413
This is his calling card.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.283
Calling card for who?
For what?

11:56.316 --> 11:59.052
I want to work with you,
DARPA, NSA, the CIA.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.154
We're not going to hire you,
we're going to prosecute you.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.890
You need me
to get to the cartels.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.925
- We got cyber-geeks of our own.
- Mm.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.027
My setup is rigged-- anybody
tries to touch my equipment,

12:07.060 --> 12:08.996
it'll crash and send out
vicious worms.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.898
My malware will twist you good.
You need me, baby, I'm your man.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.266
Nobody needs you, and
stop calling me "baby."

12:13.300 --> 12:14.802
I have a feeling we were
in a past life together--

12:14.835 --> 12:15.803
star-crossed lovers--

12:15.836 --> 12:16.837
and this is the lifetime
we finally make it work.

12:16.870 --> 12:20.240
You really don't get
what you just stepped in.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.242
You stole
from criminal conspiracies

12:22.275 --> 12:23.343
who will come after you.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.512
Virtual gangs.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.314
Yeah, they'll come
after me online.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.115
I say bring it.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.117
NIKKI:
You think this is a game?

12:30.150 --> 12:32.519
Come on, I want you
to meet someone.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.124
Hey, Estelle.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.058
How are you?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.894
They have me signing
another deposition.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.930
You made an arrest?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.798
It's Augie Harris.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.333
He steals identities
for a living.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.168
It's all insured money.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.237
Mrs. Brown is our Victim Zero.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.372
She's the reason we started
the sting operation.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.075
Tell him what happened, Estelle.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.945
Someone stole my husband's
Social Security

12:57.978 --> 12:59.312
and bank numbers,

12:59.346 --> 13:00.881
sold our house

13:00.914 --> 13:03.216
and emptied our savings

13:03.250 --> 13:04.584
before we knew anything
was wrong.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.421
Well, it-it'll take you
some time,

13:08.455 --> 13:09.857
but you'll get it all back.

13:09.890 --> 13:11.959
I don't think so.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.560
I'll hack the bank for you.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.362
How much do you want?
A hundred grand?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.166
My husband couldn't
take the stress.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.803
He had a heart attack and died.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.207
You going to hack him back
for me, too?

13:30.077 --> 13:33.046
How many IDs you think
you've stolen, Augie?

13:33.080 --> 13:35.215
Hundreds? Thousands?

13:35.248 --> 13:38.085
It was just a way to prove

13:38.118 --> 13:40.420
that I could crack the system.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.299
I'm sorry.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.073
(door opens)
DON: Hey.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.108
(door closes)
What are you doing here?

14:01.141 --> 14:03.376
Oh, I'm picking up Amita.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.945
Couldn't you send somebody?

14:04.978 --> 14:07.948
Mm, feel like driving lately.

14:07.981 --> 14:12.185
Uh-oh. I could see the red
convertible sports coupe coming.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.253
I don't know about that.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.988
Not red, anyway.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.156
Midlife crisis mobile.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.325
No, I wanted one at 45, yeah.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.459
Corvette Stingray.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.161
Really? You, a Vette?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.896
Your mother talked me out of it.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.097
I like to drive.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.265
What can I say?

14:25.298 --> 14:26.333
Where's she at?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.001
Out in the garage
with my boss,

14:28.035 --> 14:30.303
getting grilled on 3-D printers.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.471
Some wine?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.306
No, I can't.
And you know you barged

14:33.340 --> 14:34.407
right into the middle
of a sting today.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.575
I didn't know.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.110
It's a public event, right?

14:38.411 --> 14:41.381
Look, I'm considered one
of the older consultants

14:41.414 --> 14:42.615
at this young, hip
software company.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.484
So I decided to pick up
some brownie points

14:44.517 --> 14:47.587
by bringing my boss, Kath,
to see Amita speak.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.589
And it seems to be working,
anyway.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.590
(door opens)

14:50.623 --> 14:52.592
- AMITA: Hey.
- Oh, uh, uh,

14:52.625 --> 14:54.594
Kath, my son, Don.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.364
Oh, my, the heroic brother.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.999
AMITA:
So, I'm ready to go.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.567
I just need to get my
bag out of Alan's car.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.035
- Oh, uh...
- I'll meet you out front?

15:02.069 --> 15:03.036
AMITA:
All right.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.037
All right.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.405
You are really very strong.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.474
You must be what, 42, 43?

15:07.507 --> 15:08.308
Where do you work out?

15:08.341 --> 15:09.376
The FBI have a gym?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.211
Uh, yeah, actually, uh, they do.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.245
I'm staring down 45,

15:12.279 --> 15:13.180
and it's starting
to freak me out.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.215
So, how do you stay fit--
circuit training

15:15.248 --> 15:18.218
and carrot juice or...
just lots of sex?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.686
(laughs)

15:19.719 --> 15:21.354
What's your secret?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.056
My lips are sealed.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.292
I hope not.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.997
I cracked the FBI.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.431
I mean, when you think about it,
it was perfect.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.432
It was a felony.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.367
(stammers)

15:34.401 --> 15:38.305
Now you know that I can find
the weakness in your system.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.340
I proved that I'm
the dominant hacker.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.309
We like employees
who don't steal.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.379
I'm not into hurting anybody.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.149
I do altruistic hacking.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.118
I take down kiddie porn sites.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.153
I'm a good guy.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.454
You stole millions of dollars

15:54.487 --> 15:56.089
of financial information.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.357
(alarm blaring)

15:58.491 --> 16:00.427
What's the matter?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.362
Fire alarm.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.167
- Come on.
- All right.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.538
- Hey, did you do this?
- Innocent of the charges.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.705
LIZ:
Was he near a computer?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.307
No. Why, what's going on?

16:14.341 --> 16:15.342
Security reported smoke

16:15.375 --> 16:17.444
on our floor and the one below.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.117
(wailing sirens approaching)

16:31.624 --> 16:33.726
(sirens stop,
garbled radio communication)

16:35.462 --> 16:36.563
I don't see any smoke.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.797
I'll check with the fire chief.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.500
Okay, seriously,
can you offer me a deal?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.069
Somebody, somewhere
in the federal system

16:42.102 --> 16:43.203
has to show me some love.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.371
Personally, I'd like it
to be you.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.438
I'm just saying.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.407
NIKKI: The FBI is going
to want you to cooperate.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.042
You tell us what you know
about these cartels,

16:49.076 --> 16:50.610
then we'll see about a deal.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.045
AUGIE:
I know... a lot.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.146
DAVID:
Gun!

16:53.180 --> 16:54.347
(gunshot)

16:59.552 --> 17:02.055
(gunshot, screaming)

17:02.089 --> 17:02.789
(body thuds)

17:06.526 --> 17:07.360
- Hey, you all right?
- DAVID: Yeah.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.743
(people shouting)
DAVID: Liz?

17:23.776 --> 17:25.445
- LIZ: Dead.
- DAVID: Give me

17:25.478 --> 17:27.214
a secure perimeter-- two blocks

17:27.247 --> 17:29.582
- in every direction.
- On it!

17:29.616 --> 17:30.450
I want all surveillance video

17:30.483 --> 17:32.085
from the outside
of this building. Okay?

17:32.119 --> 17:34.454
Hey, hey, don't let anybody
touch the body!

17:34.487 --> 17:36.356
Don't let anybody
leave! Thank you.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.358
(sharp exhale)

17:38.391 --> 17:39.559
I need LAPD helicopters.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.828
I want to know of any vehicle
trying to leave the area.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.663
What just happened?
What just happened?!

17:43.696 --> 17:46.333
I mean... Oh, my gosh!

17:46.366 --> 17:48.235
(stammering): There's no fire!
There's no fire!

17:48.268 --> 17:49.436
Someone-someone hacked

17:49.469 --> 17:50.737
into a fire alarm
to try to kill me?

17:50.770 --> 17:51.771
Did you recognize him?

17:51.804 --> 17:52.772
No, I-I've never...

17:52.805 --> 17:54.241
I've never seen that guy before.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.408
I've never seen him bef...

17:55.442 --> 17:56.776
He shot at me. He shot...

17:56.809 --> 17:58.811
I've never been shot at before.
Am I hit?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.513
Am I hit? 'Cause I-I
hear that you-you

18:00.547 --> 18:02.249
you can be shot and not know it.
(stammering)

18:02.282 --> 18:04.551
I mean, I didn't feel any-any
bee stings or any, like,

18:04.584 --> 18:05.518
bites or anything
like that, but...

18:05.552 --> 18:07.520
Augie, look at me, all right?
You're okay.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.788
Okay, you're safe.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.290
I don't want you going
into shock, all right?

18:10.323 --> 18:11.324
Am I hyperventilating?

18:11.358 --> 18:13.260
DAVID:
Is he all right?

18:13.293 --> 18:14.561
I'm going into shock.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.363
He's fine.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.497
Did you see his
fighting style?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.698
Yeah, Krav Maga.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.268
That's specialty of Israeli
Defense Forces.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.270
- NIKKI: And that gun...
- .25 caliber

18:23.303 --> 18:25.372
with a half load.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.374
Also Mossad style.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.309
The Israeli army is after me?

18:30.443 --> 18:31.644
Stow him with the U.S. Marshals.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.246
Do not use his real name.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.182
I gotta call Don.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.383
Wait, wait.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.851
Uh, this just might be
the shock talking,

18:38.885 --> 18:41.854
but y-you just saved my life
over there,

18:41.888 --> 18:43.756
and I'm, I'm, I'm feeling
some pretty intense emotions

18:43.790 --> 18:44.791
about you right now.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.793
Actually, it was Agent Sinclair,

18:46.826 --> 18:48.728
but I'll let him know
how you feel.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.399
CHARLIE:
Hey, do we even need to work

18:52.432 --> 18:54.267
from Augie's hardware
at the hotel?

18:54.301 --> 18:56.903
He's using the private WiFi
set up for PenTest.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.505
I think I can breach
his firewalls

18:58.538 --> 18:59.472
without touching the physical
setup.

18:59.506 --> 19:00.573
Good.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.309
And can you tell if he's rigged
it to destroy data?

19:02.342 --> 19:04.344
I don't think so,
but it'd be a lot faster

19:04.377 --> 19:05.878
if we could get his password.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.447
Hey, so is Augie Harris
cooperating?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.315
Well, he was just shot at,

19:08.348 --> 19:09.816
so I'd say
he's getting about ready.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.618
Oh. Can we get him over here?

19:11.651 --> 19:12.719
No way. He's too hot.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.787
Look, if I can get his
access code, I can do this.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.823
All right, let me see
if I can get that.

19:16.856 --> 19:17.957
Yeah, once we're inside
his system...

19:17.990 --> 19:19.726
Yeah, we can see who's attacking
it and where they are.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.494
- Hey.
- NIKKI: Yeah, Don.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.562
- Hi, Donald.
- DON: Yeah, look.

19:22.595 --> 19:26.433
Augie, I need the access
code to your hotel setup.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.234
What'll you give me for it?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.835
25 to life if you
don't cooperate.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.337
Look, pal,
you were just shot at.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.639
You need our protection.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.207
Jockstrap.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.242
What?

19:35.275 --> 19:36.243
Jockstrap?

19:36.276 --> 19:37.344
That's the code?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.177
- That's what he said.
- Jockstrap.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.513
- Written in leetspeak.
- DON: What?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.349
- In leetspeak?
- Oh, I got it. -j, 0...

19:42.382 --> 19:43.683
left parentheses, pipe,

19:43.716 --> 19:48.455
left brace, dollar, 7, r, 4, p.

19:49.889 --> 19:50.957
It worked.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.927
Jockstrap?

19:54.961 --> 19:56.596
I've got them by the...

19:56.629 --> 19:58.331
Nice.

19:59.466 --> 20:02.302
So, love of my life,

20:02.335 --> 20:05.638
uh, jail is not the place
for me.

20:05.672 --> 20:08.541
Why don't we go to a hotel,
like in the movies?

20:08.575 --> 20:10.877
You can show me your big guns,
we'll order room service.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.279
Not going to happen.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.448
I don't do well
in testosterone-rich areas.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.584
Uh, I'm a big swinging hack
online,

20:17.617 --> 20:19.952
but in person,
I'm a cuddle-bunny.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.454
It's not like I'm tossing you
in the drunk tank.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.523
You'll be in protective custody.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.793
Let me help you
with the investigation.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.561
Augie, people want to kill you.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.929
I want to kill you.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.864
In a good way?

20:33.433 --> 20:36.035
In custody with the marshals
is the safest place.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.003
Nobody'll know where you are.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.373
You'll be in a cell
a day, two at the most.

20:41.674 --> 20:42.942
When all this is over,

20:42.975 --> 20:46.012
and you finally realize
what a great guy I am,

20:46.045 --> 20:48.448
will you go out with me?

21:00.493 --> 21:03.563
Interpol says the shooter who
went after Augie was ex-Mossad.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.465
Arrested and released
in Tel Aviv last year

21:05.498 --> 21:07.434
on gunrunning charges
that didn't stick.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.502
Look who he's been
hanging out with-- The Fist.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.670
Zal Feigenbaum.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.038
What, he was just
another kid, huh?

21:12.071 --> 21:15.408
Yeah, Feigenbaum is Israeli,
a child computer genius,

21:15.442 --> 21:17.477
busted at 13
for hacking the Knesset.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.512
Up to serious badness
ever since.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.749
Okay, so, Zal Feigenbaum sells
high-tech weaponry

21:22.782 --> 21:25.084
to Hamas, al Qaeda, North Korea,

21:25.117 --> 21:26.886
- anyone who will pay him.
- DON: What do we got?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.588
An Israeli selling weapons
to Hamas?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.556
DAVID:
Yeah, not just guns.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.724
Also sells software--
access to military,

21:31.758 --> 21:33.593
top-secret computer systems.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.727
Okay, so what's the deal?

21:34.761 --> 21:36.596
He comes, he wants to check out
our-our cool printer...

21:36.629 --> 21:38.898
So he can make weapons that pass
through metal detectors.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.467
He's on the terrorist
no-fly list.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.569
Killed the valet, 'cause
if we get our hands on him,

21:42.602 --> 21:44.471
he's on his way back to Israel.

21:44.504 --> 21:47.374
DAVID: Look, why does a guy like
this risk sending an assassin

21:47.407 --> 21:48.375
onto FBI property,

21:48.408 --> 21:51.110
just so he can kill a gnat
like Augie Harris?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.912
Can't let Harris steal from him?

21:52.945 --> 21:54.381
Makes him look weak.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.382
Nah, I say it's more than that.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.049
I say this kid,
Augie's got something on him.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.652
I showed him Feigenbaum's photo,
he didn't recognize him.

21:59.686 --> 22:00.720
Maybe he doesn't know what
he has.

22:00.753 --> 22:01.821
LIZ: We did grab him

22:01.854 --> 22:03.456
before he could check
the results of his big hack.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.425
See what Charlie
and Amita say about that.

22:05.458 --> 22:09.496
I'm gonna get working on witness
protection for the kid.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.798
AUGIE: Okay, uh, this isn't
right. I'm, like,

22:11.831 --> 22:14.000
the number-one
hacker in the world right now,

22:14.033 --> 22:15.668
but who's keeping track?

22:15.702 --> 22:17.770
Hey, this is the guy
we called you about.

22:17.804 --> 22:19.806
We need you to keep him
for a day or two.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.475
- Name's William Gates.
- We can do that.

22:22.509 --> 22:23.576
Gates? Really?

22:23.610 --> 22:24.877
(door buzzing)
Uh...

22:24.911 --> 22:26.546
final offer-- the Hilton?

22:26.579 --> 22:27.514
Steaks by the pool?

22:27.547 --> 22:30.016
- Me, you, the moon?
- See you, Mr. Gates.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.785
Uh...

22:32.819 --> 22:35.154
any chance of getting
a single cell?

22:35.187 --> 22:36.556
Uh, an amoeba.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.958
It's a biology joke. Get it?

22:38.991 --> 22:40.059
I'll take an amoeba
with pay-per-view,

22:40.092 --> 22:41.894
if you can swing it.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.063
MARSHAL:
Nervous, kid? Come on.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.532
(buzzing)

22:46.866 --> 22:48.568
Do you think
I should be concerned

22:48.601 --> 22:49.636
with Penetration Testing,
Marshal?

22:49.669 --> 22:51.170
(chuckling)

22:51.203 --> 22:52.439
(camera shutter clicks)

22:55.642 --> 22:57.176
MARSHAL:
Okay, kid.

22:57.209 --> 22:59.812
AMITA: The Eastern Europeans
are making the biggest push

22:59.846 --> 23:01.814
to grab back Augie's
credit card site.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.617
Yeah, but all their attacks
are originating in Europe.

23:04.651 --> 23:06.553
Yeah. Weedy Luzon's hits
are coming

23:06.586 --> 23:08.755
from the Philippines and China.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.122
One from Korea.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.591
Where is Zal Feigenbaum?

23:11.624 --> 23:12.859
I don't know.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.695
We can try to figure it out, but
he has to try to hack us first.

23:15.728 --> 23:16.529
It's weird, because, you know,

23:16.563 --> 23:18.565
he makes an attempt
on Augie's life,

23:18.598 --> 23:21.668
and he's the only one who hasn't
made an attempt on Augie's site.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.002
(sighs)

23:23.035 --> 23:24.537
You know what?

23:24.571 --> 23:26.906
Why don't you check
the code history

23:26.939 --> 23:29.642
where Augie hacked
Feigenbaum's carding site?

23:29.676 --> 23:31.611
Right. There could be
a back door--

23:31.644 --> 23:33.646
some hidden connection
between Feigenbaum's

23:33.680 --> 23:35.682
credit card business
and his weapons sales.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.149
I mean, that would be a reason
to kill Augie.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.719
And maybe a way
to find Feigenbaum.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.721
Okay, this is gonna
take me a while.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.524
What do you think
of my dad's new boss?

23:44.557 --> 23:45.992
(chuckles)

23:46.025 --> 23:48.595
Oh, she's kind of driven, but

23:48.628 --> 23:49.662
I like her.

23:49.696 --> 23:52.532
Did you notice, she seemed
to be coming on to Alan?

23:52.565 --> 23:54.701
Actually, I felt she
was giving me a bit

23:54.734 --> 23:56.569
of her erotic attention.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.104
Really?

23:58.137 --> 23:59.906
- Yes.
- Hmm.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.908
I was quite uncomfortable

24:01.941 --> 24:04.110
and oddly flattered.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.679
You're blushing.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.715
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah.

24:08.748 --> 24:10.683
And gloating.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.619
(Amita laughs)

24:22.729 --> 24:24.631
So, how's it going?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.568
Overcrowding in the California

24:28.601 --> 24:30.269
penal system's
a real bitch, huh?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.838
Shut up and sit down.

24:35.274 --> 24:38.711
How would you guys like
to make some money?

24:38.745 --> 24:41.147
You gonna pay me so I don't pull
your tongue out of your head?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.615
Better idea.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.017
Can you get me an old cell phone
in here?

24:45.051 --> 24:46.986
I need a particular
make and model.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.154
Shut him up, please.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.691
(whispering):
I can...

24:51.724 --> 24:53.660
I can hack bank accounts
with it.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.962
(sighs)

24:58.197 --> 24:59.766
How many you want?

25:04.737 --> 25:06.706
Augie inserted a back door
into every site he hacked.

25:06.739 --> 25:07.874
Okay.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.876
- A back door?
- A secret entrance

25:09.909 --> 25:10.743
into all
Feigenbaum's computer files.

25:10.777 --> 25:11.811
Yeah, we open it up,

25:11.844 --> 25:13.279
it's like a gold
mine of evidence--

25:13.312 --> 25:14.781
weapons shipments to terrorists,

25:14.814 --> 25:16.816
sales of top-secret data.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.184
It may even tell us
where Feigenbaum is.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.186
- Great. How do we open it?
- We need Augie.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.954
Yeah. Where is he?

25:21.988 --> 25:23.923
(buzzing)
Gates.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.825
At your service.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.828
MARSHAL: Your release papers
came through.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.698
I thought the FBI
was coming for you.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.766
Got me.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.202
So... we're good?

25:36.235 --> 25:38.605
Solid.

25:38.638 --> 25:39.606
(buzzing)

25:44.143 --> 25:46.212
Ciao, baby.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.546
Phew!

25:55.788 --> 25:58.858
He forged his release documents
on a cell phone? Come on.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.260
There's an old model
that can be adapted for WiFi

26:01.293 --> 26:02.862
if you know what you're doing.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.230
It's mostly used for illegal
bank transfers, but...

26:04.263 --> 26:05.832
It's got to be a first.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.634
Well, Augie's resourceful.
You got to give him that.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.769
Well, he's gonna be dead
if we don't get to him soon.

26:09.802 --> 26:10.737
I can tell you that.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.639
All right, I'm gonna
go see how Amita's doing

26:12.672 --> 26:13.706
- with cracking the back door.
- All right, good.

26:13.740 --> 26:14.974
Thanks.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.844
I just got off the phone with
Estelle Brown, our Victim Zero.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.712
Someone just transferred 100
grand into her bank account.

26:19.746 --> 26:20.880
That's got to be Augie.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.682
What is he, Robin Hood now?

26:22.715 --> 26:24.016
I'm straightening it out.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.284
Look, he meant well.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.787
I don't get it.
Why is the kid running?

26:27.820 --> 26:29.221
He was totally safe.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.158
He wants
to be a rock star hacker,

26:32.191 --> 26:33.960
not some jerk in a jail cell

26:33.993 --> 26:36.195
about to be relocated
to Pacoima.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.364
Come on, you can't blame him.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.633
What, you got a little
soft spot for him?

26:40.667 --> 26:41.968
No.

26:44.236 --> 26:47.273
Well, this is his only relative
not in Jersey.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.008
Rose Harris.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.777
You think
he's hiding out with his aunt?

26:50.810 --> 26:52.812
He's broke, he doesn't have
a car, he ain't local,

26:52.845 --> 26:54.881
so why don't you find David
and get over there?

26:54.914 --> 26:56.048
Yeah.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.851
Augie's witness protection
deal-- did it come through?

26:58.885 --> 27:00.219
No, better-- Fort Meade.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.754
The NSA wants him?

27:01.788 --> 27:02.922
Alive, preferably.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.771
NIKKI:
So, looks like the NSA wants

27:18.805 --> 27:20.272
to hire Augie.

27:22.141 --> 27:24.076
(David laughs)
What?

27:24.110 --> 27:25.878
You like this Augie guy.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.113
No way.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.781
Okay.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.919
He makes me laugh.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.822
Let's just try and keep him
from getting dead, all right?

27:37.056 --> 27:38.124
Okay.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.861
AMITA:
Back door's locked.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.763
I've got a program

27:43.796 --> 27:45.932
trying to decode it,
but it could take days.

27:45.965 --> 27:48.835
Still no sign of Feigenbaum
trying to attack Augie's site.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.369
No, and Zal Feigenbaum

27:50.402 --> 27:52.471
is easily as good a hacker
as Augie.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.407
Yeah, he's probably trying
to decode the back door, too.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.811
You know what? What if he's not
trying to hack Augie?

27:58.845 --> 28:01.180
I mean, what if
he's trying to find him?

28:01.213 --> 28:03.449
IRC-- Internet Relay Chat.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.051
It's how hackers talk

28:05.084 --> 28:07.053
when they don't want
to be overheard.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.221
It's a pretty
primitive chat program.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.991
Think of it like
shipping channels in the ocean.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.125
You can't see them

28:13.159 --> 28:15.194
until a boat cuts through
the water, leaving a wake.

28:15.227 --> 28:17.029
If two boats meet in the middle
of the ocean

28:17.063 --> 28:18.865
to swap a load of illegal drugs,

28:18.898 --> 28:20.733
you have to catch them
in real time.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.835
Otherwise, there's no evidence
of the meeting left behind.

28:22.869 --> 28:25.204
No names, no accounts,
no records of exchange.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.006
Well, how do they see
each other?

28:27.039 --> 28:28.307
Online names.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.175
Okay, so what?

28:29.208 --> 28:31.310
We got The Fist,
and-and what's Augie's?

28:31.343 --> 28:34.146
OOzemeister.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.048
I'll set up an alarm to alert us

28:36.082 --> 28:37.917
if either name enters
an IRC channel.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.185
And can we see
what they're saying?

28:39.218 --> 28:40.920
In leetspeak.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.088
Luckily, I speak leet.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.023
That's so hot.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.191
(Don sighs)

28:45.224 --> 28:46.926
(laughs)

28:46.959 --> 28:48.327
(waves crashing)

28:48.360 --> 28:49.862
DAVID:
Ms. Harris,

28:49.896 --> 28:51.463
Augie's in a lot of trouble.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.332
NIKKI:
He hasn't been here.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.500
Somebody tried to kill him.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.235
He didn't tell me that.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.503
So you talked to him?

28:57.536 --> 28:59.872
Why would anyone want
to hurt Augie?

29:03.475 --> 29:05.511
L.A. Detention Center.
(sighs)

29:07.213 --> 29:10.049
Okay. He wasn't here long.

29:10.082 --> 29:10.917
Where'd he go?

29:10.950 --> 29:12.418
I told him to go back
to New Jersey,

29:12.451 --> 29:13.786
but who listens to me?

29:13.820 --> 29:15.021
What did he say?
What did he tell you?

29:15.054 --> 29:16.488
That some people
were mad at him,

29:16.522 --> 29:18.157
but that he was going to fix it.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.158
Did he say how?

29:19.191 --> 29:22.128
You think he'd tell me?

29:22.161 --> 29:25.064
I gave him my laptop
and some money.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.999
I love that boy.

29:27.033 --> 29:29.501
But he's too smart
to tell me anything.

29:36.242 --> 29:37.376
(computer trilling)

29:37.409 --> 29:39.278
CHARLIE:
All right, Feigenbaum's online.

29:39.311 --> 29:40.279
Yeah, I'll get Don.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.048
What are they saying?

29:42.081 --> 29:43.115
(trilling, beeps)

29:46.018 --> 29:47.920
Okay. "Got a surprise for you."

29:47.954 --> 29:50.522
AMITA (reading):
"Funny. Got one for you, too."

29:50.556 --> 29:52.291
You got a trace?

29:52.324 --> 29:54.160
Yeah, but they're probably
bouncing off a hundred IPs.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.863
I mean, they'll be off-line
before we get a location.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.564
AMITA:
"We should meet."

29:58.597 --> 29:59.999
AMITA:
"Ha-ha.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.000
"Touch my system

30:01.033 --> 30:02.334
and it will eat your young."

30:02.368 --> 30:04.036
Okay, that was Augie.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.471
All right, so what?
Feigenbaum wants to meet.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.472
Augie's rewriting his code.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.373
Okay, wait, you guys, wait.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.075
This is going to be
over in a second.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.076
LIZ:
Can we get a screen shot?

30:10.109 --> 30:12.178
(typing)
Got it.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.180
CHARLIE:
It's gone, the channel's gone.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.082
(Don sighs)
Okay.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.583
Augie's daring Feigenbaum
to attack,

30:17.616 --> 30:19.018
says he's embedded
a vicious worm

30:19.051 --> 30:19.986
in the system.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.520
For Augie to rewrite his code,

30:21.553 --> 30:23.122
he's got to be using
the PenTest system,

30:23.155 --> 30:23.822
which means
he's back at the hotel

30:23.856 --> 30:25.191
in range
of the PenTest WiFi.

30:25.224 --> 30:26.358
I'll get over there.
You keep me posted.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.293
All right.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.062
(typing)

30:30.096 --> 30:33.332
Feigenbaum is sending
a photograph for Augie.

30:33.365 --> 30:34.466
Where? Can you open it?

30:40.306 --> 30:41.640
Don, wait.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.042
Feigenbaum posted this
for Augie.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.289
(siren wailing)

30:57.323 --> 30:59.992
(tires screeching)

31:02.094 --> 31:03.930
Look at this.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.432
Feigenbaum has already tried to
kill Augie.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.167
He doesn't want any hostages.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.501
He's luring Augie out of
hiding.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.336
Yeah.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.638
(tires screeching)

31:12.671 --> 31:14.106
(siren wailing)

31:15.241 --> 31:17.343
Fist, I'm here.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.513
Take me, let her go.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.249
She's just an old lady.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.951
That's not fair game.

31:27.453 --> 31:31.323
I'll give you... I'll give you
the key to the castle.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.458
I'll work for you, all right?

31:32.491 --> 31:34.060
You win.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.500
I got, like, I got, like, half
a million credit card numbers

31:41.533 --> 31:43.235
on my laptop-- they're yours.

31:43.269 --> 31:45.571
Okay?

31:45.604 --> 31:47.039
Fist?

31:48.407 --> 31:50.376
Aunt Rose?

31:50.409 --> 31:52.344
Fist?

31:56.082 --> 31:57.516
(whispers):
Oh, my God.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.153
(whispers):
Aunt Rose...

32:04.223 --> 32:05.191
No...

32:05.224 --> 32:06.625
(choked sob)

32:07.994 --> 32:09.095
(door opens)

32:18.537 --> 32:19.605
(two gunshots)

32:27.213 --> 32:28.547
(tires screeching)

32:37.423 --> 32:39.758
Backup will be here
in a few minutes.

32:39.791 --> 32:40.726
Meanwhile...

32:40.759 --> 32:43.029
- Let's take a look.
- Yeah.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.179
(outside door opening)

33:05.817 --> 33:08.620
No! (shouting in Hebrew)

33:08.654 --> 33:10.056
(gunshot)

33:10.089 --> 33:11.690
(David grunts)

33:13.759 --> 33:15.261
(gunshot)

33:20.632 --> 33:22.601
(panting)

33:24.236 --> 33:26.038
Augie, give it up!

33:26.072 --> 33:27.406
You're out of your league!

33:29.675 --> 33:31.177
(gunshots)

33:34.080 --> 33:36.182
DAVID:
Feigenbaum!

33:36.215 --> 33:38.417
Feigenbaum, FBI.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.551
You lower your weapon.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.297
FBI! Stop where you are!

33:53.132 --> 33:54.666
FBI! Stop!

33:56.368 --> 33:58.304
(gunshots)

34:04.576 --> 34:05.277
(groans)

34:07.746 --> 34:09.281
(groans)

34:09.315 --> 34:11.283
Only way out is through me!

34:11.317 --> 34:13.385
That'll work!

34:17.156 --> 34:19.225
(glass clatters)

34:20.859 --> 34:22.761
You should stick to computers!

34:22.794 --> 34:25.631
Put your hands behind your back.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.233
(groaning)
Let's move!

34:40.279 --> 34:41.747
(panting)

34:45.584 --> 34:47.753
You okay?

34:47.786 --> 34:51.323
They... they kill...
they killed my Aunt Rose.

34:53.459 --> 34:56.094
I'm sorry, Augie.

34:57.896 --> 35:01.533
(sobbing):
It's my... it's my fault.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.308
What did... what did I do?

35:15.581 --> 35:17.483
(sobbing)

35:32.698 --> 35:35.234
(distant siren blares)

35:35.267 --> 35:37.236
ALAN: Come on, tell me,
what did you buy?

35:37.269 --> 35:39.505
DON: Well, you'll just have to
wait and see, now, won't you?

35:39.538 --> 35:41.340
You sure it's a new car
you need?

35:41.373 --> 35:42.608
Maybe just a new relationship?

35:42.641 --> 35:45.344
Where are you with Robin
these days?

35:45.377 --> 35:46.812
She's in Portland on a trial,

35:46.845 --> 35:49.515
but we're fine for two people
who barely see each other.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.217
Why don't you just
join a hockey league

35:51.250 --> 35:53.619
or a softball team
and do something to feel alive

35:53.652 --> 35:55.287
that costs a little less?

35:55.321 --> 35:56.288
I like to drive.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.290
Oh, come on.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.926
Donnie, this is
a major investment.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.229
Where are you going?

36:06.265 --> 36:11.803
1,100 cc's, built for speed
and nice, winding roads.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.239
(sighs)

36:13.272 --> 36:14.706
Pretty sweet, eh?

36:14.740 --> 36:15.707
(whistles)

36:15.741 --> 36:16.808
How fast it go?

36:16.842 --> 36:17.809
Well...

36:17.843 --> 36:19.678
(engine starts)

36:19.711 --> 36:21.313
ALAN:
Huh?

36:21.347 --> 36:22.648
I'll have to let you know.

36:22.681 --> 36:26.385
You mind driving
my car home for me?

36:26.418 --> 36:27.553
Yeah, sure.

36:27.586 --> 36:30.222
(engine revs)

36:33.325 --> 36:35.327
Yeah, that's what I love--

36:35.361 --> 36:38.330
a good midlife crisis.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.400
AMITA:
So Augie's gonna

36:41.433 --> 36:42.801
- work for the NSA.
-(chuckling): Yeah.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.803
Well, at least now his
brilliant mind's on our side.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.037
I think he's a really good guy.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.374
I just think he blurred the
boundaries between the virtual

36:48.407 --> 36:50.576
and the real and found
his morality compromised.

36:50.609 --> 36:53.379
The neurochemical pathways
in the brain are the same

36:53.412 --> 36:55.514
for an image
experienced in reality

36:55.547 --> 36:56.648
and one seen in a
virtual 3-D world.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.451
In other words, uh...
the virtual is alive and real

36:59.485 --> 37:01.820
- in our minds.
- Well, that's how

37:01.853 --> 37:04.656
images from dreams can get
mixed with actual memories.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.825
Very confusing thing,
being a person.

37:06.858 --> 37:07.826
(Amita chuckles)

37:07.859 --> 37:08.860
What's this?

37:08.894 --> 37:10.729
Uh, that's something Kath sent.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.498
Oh, for my dad?
(door opens)

37:12.531 --> 37:14.766
Ah, perfect timing.
Dinner's ready.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.402
ALAN: Hey, wait till you
guys see what Don...

37:16.435 --> 37:18.470
Uh, uh... I'll show 'em
after dinner.

37:18.504 --> 37:19.538
(Alan chuckles)
CHARLIE: Hey, Dad,

37:19.571 --> 37:20.639
Kath Berry sent this over
for you.

37:20.672 --> 37:21.640
Oh, for me?

37:21.673 --> 37:23.041
What is it?

37:23.074 --> 37:26.745
Not good for your boss
to have the hots for you, is it?

37:26.778 --> 37:29.047
Uh-uh, guys, she was definitely
giving me the vibe.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.882
I don't know, I think
she's into the brainy type.

37:30.916 --> 37:31.317
Wh...

37:31.350 --> 37:32.484
What is this?

37:32.518 --> 37:34.320
It's like a dominatrix.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.554
(chuckles)
You know what that is?

37:35.587 --> 37:36.688
That's...
that's Amita's avatar.

37:36.722 --> 37:37.956
That's your avatar, right?

37:37.989 --> 37:39.558
It's a 3-D print.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.793
Um, Kath must have made it
with her new printer.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.329
Oh, well, how nice.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.330
That's so cool.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.331
Let's see.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.433
"Amita, a token
of appreciation.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.902
Can I take you to lunch,
dinner, a weekend in Sonoma?"

37:50.936 --> 37:51.937
- No.
- CHARLIE: That's what it says.

37:51.970 --> 37:52.771
AMITA: Okay.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.472
ALAN: Wait a minute, wait a
minute,

37:53.505 --> 37:54.172
does that mean that she's...?

37:54.205 --> 37:56.842
Me and my avatar are spoken for.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.510
(laughs)

37:58.544 --> 37:59.745
You guys hungry?

37:59.778 --> 38:01.447
I don't know
how I feel about this.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.082
Well, there goes
my sexual harassment lawsuit.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.618
Say, a weekend in Sonoma.

38:06.652 --> 38:07.953
This girl definitely has
an agenda.

38:07.986 --> 38:10.622
Well, I do like wine tasting.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.724
And to think,
I had designs on this woman.
