01:13.574 --> 01:15.976
[laughing]

01:17.077 --> 01:19.480
[music playing]

01:23.551 --> 01:24.452
Come on, Dad!

01:24.552 --> 01:26.487
I want to go see the movie.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.156
Hold on there, Bobalouis.

01:28.256 --> 01:32.760
I want to check out
this her cute waitress.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.463
Excuse me, miss,
when you get a minute.

01:35.563 --> 01:39.032
Yeah, you'll be
the first to know.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.368
So what about you, DJ?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.270
You got a kiss for your old
ma, or would you rather have

01:42.370 --> 01:43.937
a hot poker in the eyeball?

01:44.037 --> 01:45.806
Poker, please.

01:45.906 --> 01:46.774
[smooching]

01:46.874 --> 01:47.675
Yuck!

01:51.179 --> 01:54.948
So what are you boys up to?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.851
Oh, just going
upstairs to the cineplex.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.753
You going to go
see 101 Dalmatians?

01:59.853 --> 02:00.921
Nah.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.891
He won't go for that
unless 95 of them blow up.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.627
Hey, on your way home, don't
forget to pick up some mushroom

02:06.727 --> 02:08.028
soup and that macaroni, OK?

02:08.128 --> 02:10.764
Because I'm making your dad's
favorite tuna casserole.

02:10.864 --> 02:11.665
Yuck.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.033
I know.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.502
It's god awful, isn't it?

02:14.602 --> 02:18.005
And especially
the way I make it.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.541
Oh, Christmas in January,
with old Ed Conner.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.343
Same was when I was a kid, man.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.577
Always on the road.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.978
But that's how he
kept ahead of all

02:25.078 --> 02:27.147
the other salesmen who stayed
at home with their families

02:27.248 --> 02:28.982
for the holidays.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.384
Oh, Dan, if you're
just going to sit

02:30.484 --> 02:32.320
here and gripe about your dad,
you've got to order something.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.388
Come on, DJ, let's go.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.356
See ya, Crystal.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.790
- Bye, guys.
- Bye!

02:36.890 --> 02:38.158
Now, you know what to do.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.361
You go up to the window and ask
for two children's' tickets.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.565
I don't understand
why Dan didn't

02:44.665 --> 02:46.033
get along with his father.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.968
I've always found Ed
to be a wonderful man.

02:48.068 --> 02:48.869
Well, me too.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.338
I get along with him great.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.640
Of course, I'm a people person.

02:52.740 --> 02:53.941
[telephone ringing]
There's the phone.

02:54.041 --> 02:54.842
Excuse me.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.848
Hello, Rodbell's Coffee Shop.

03:00.948 --> 03:01.849
Home of the quick serve.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.319
What?

03:05.419 --> 03:06.320
I can't hear you, Darlene.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.289
Tell Becky to stop screaming.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.189
OK.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.758
Now, what did DJ do?

03:10.858 --> 03:12.893
How-- how could he do
anything like that?

03:12.993 --> 03:15.329
He's not even home.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.431
All right so-- now,
where'd you find it?

03:20.133 --> 03:21.435
All right.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.606
Well, just put it in a bag, and
I'll bury it when I get there.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.507
OK.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.408
Bye.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.976
Problem?

03:29.076 --> 03:29.877
Oh.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.512
It's just DJ.

03:31.612 --> 03:34.448
He needs some little
friends to play with.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.350
You ought to bring Lonnie
around this weekend.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.818
I know he'd love
to play with him.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.021
Uh, Lonnie's at his
grandma's for the weekend.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.155
Well, then next weekend.

03:42.256 --> 03:46.660
Roseanne, Lonnie
is scared of DJ.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.561
Oh.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.863
OK.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.800
Well, at least
DJ has a father.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.868
I tell you, I feel
real bad about Lonnie

03:54.968 --> 03:56.236
growing up without a father.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.106
Oh, Crystal, don't get upset.

03:59.206 --> 04:03.411
Somewhere out there, there is
a guy who is perfect for you.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.583
Excuse me a minute.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.088
Hey, Donald, do you
like tuna casserole?

04:15.188 --> 04:16.690
Not very much Roseanne.

04:16.790 --> 04:20.093
Eh, you'll eat it anyway.

04:20.193 --> 04:22.062
[music playing]

04:28.001 --> 04:29.870
So Crystal doesn't even
know this dinner's a fix up?

04:29.970 --> 04:30.971
No.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.239
She don't even know
she's coming for dinner.

04:32.340 --> 04:35.743
She thinks she's just
dropping off the fondue pot.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.345
What's the guy think?

04:37.445 --> 04:40.047
Well, you know, he's a single
guy, and we got hot food.

04:40.147 --> 04:43.183
That's all he needs to know.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.685
Hey, put more cheese in there.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.487
The regular cheese
or the stinky cheese?

04:46.587 --> 04:48.422
Stinky.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.323
Yuck.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.460
It smells like Dad's feet.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.027
Lunch sure smells good.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.201
Hey Darlene, put another
box of macaroni in there.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.570
Well, how much should I put?

05:02.670 --> 05:05.005
The box says serves 10.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.607
Well, there's 8 of us.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.276
So two boxes ought to do it.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.444
Hey, my Dad's coming.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.579
That's six.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.447
Well, I run into
Crystal at the mall today.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.348
Seven.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.416
And she seemed
kind of lonely--

05:15.516 --> 05:16.717
Eight.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.186
Roseanne, you're not playing
matchmaker again, are ya?

05:19.286 --> 05:20.988
Every time you do, it
blows up in your face.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.322
What are you talking about?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.924
I fixed up your friend
Pete and his wife.

05:24.024 --> 05:24.825
Yeah.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.127
And they're divorced now.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.496
Really?

05:28.596 --> 05:31.331
He would be perfect for Jackie.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.232
[doorbell ringing]

05:32.332 --> 05:33.300
DJ: Grandpa!
- Oh.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.201
Cool.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.102
Presents.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.239
You coming?

05:39.339 --> 05:40.874
Plenty of time.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.175
You got to make it tough.

05:42.275 --> 05:43.377
Right, Conner?
- No.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.645
I just want to
finish this article.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.047
Oh.
You're reading Cosmo?

05:47.147 --> 05:47.948
Yeah.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.820
Eeh!

05:52.920 --> 05:54.688
- For Becky.
- Thanks a lot, Grandpa.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.623
For Darlene.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.824
Thank you, Grandpa.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.125
For Grandpa.

05:58.225 --> 05:59.026
What'd you bring me?

05:59.126 --> 05:59.927
What'd you bring me?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.495
It's right here.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.464
I got you, uh, a set of books.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.867
I'm kidding.

06:06.967 --> 06:07.801
I'm just kidding.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.069
It's a death ray.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.804
Great!

06:10.904 --> 06:11.939
What'd you bring me?

06:12.039 --> 06:12.840
What'd you bring me?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.274
Hey, Rosebud!

06:14.374 --> 06:17.611
You look younger and more
beautiful every time I see you!

06:17.711 --> 06:21.649
You know, you're a lying sack
of skin, Ed, but I love ya.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.216
How are you doing?

06:23.316 --> 06:24.752
I couldn't be better, Rosie.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.754
So where's that,
uh, bum you married.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.489
He's out there in the kitchen.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.357
I'm supposed to
go to him, right?

06:30.458 --> 06:31.859
Well, I think that's the plan.

06:31.959 --> 06:32.760
OK.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.200
- Dad.
- Danny boy!

06:40.300 --> 06:41.101
Come here!

06:41.201 --> 06:42.803
[laughing]

06:42.903 --> 06:44.237
Getcha, getcha, getcha.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.277
- How's business, Dad?
- Great!

06:50.377 --> 06:52.112
I'm having the best
year of my life.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.516
I picked up one of these
lines of fancy coffees,

06:55.616 --> 06:59.119
Dutch mocha, amoretta cream.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.621
Ah, here we go.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.989
Chocolate parfait.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.525
We've got this great
advertising campaign.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.227
For the quiet
moments of your life.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.598
Well, I haven't had a
quiet moment in 17 years.

07:10.698 --> 07:11.865
What else you bring me?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.868
Just so happens, I did
bring you a little something.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.369
You didn't have
to do that, Dad.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.337
What, Danny?

07:17.437 --> 07:18.639
It's a gift.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.307
I mean, that's what you call
it when you give somebody

07:20.407 --> 07:21.509
something you don't have to.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.176
When you have to
it's called alimony.

07:23.276 --> 07:27.447
Har, har, har, har, har, har.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.683
Grandpa, you got
us video tapes.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.418
Well, you don't like
the movies I picked?

07:31.519 --> 07:32.452
Oh no, we love them.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.654
We just don't have a VCR.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.455
Oh.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.057
we do now.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.392
All right, Grandpa!

07:39.493 --> 07:41.061
A VCR, Beck.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.963
The Conner family
leaps into the 80s.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.702
Now, listen you two, you
take it into the living room.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.638
I'll come in in a second,
help you, uh, hook it up.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.639
You know.
- Thanks, Grandpa.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.841
Yeah, now we really love you.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.643
[laughing]

07:55.743 --> 07:58.078
Uh, listen, there's um--

07:58.178 --> 07:59.880
there's something I've got
to talk to you too about.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.181
Is that what the VCR is for?

08:01.281 --> 08:02.482
To soften us up?

08:02.583 --> 08:06.186
No, the VCR was a second
prize in a sales contest.

08:06.286 --> 08:09.089
If I ha won the first prize,
I'd be in Hawaii right now.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.558
You wouldn't have to
put up with me at all.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.759
- Jeez, Dan.
- All right.

08:11.859 --> 08:12.793
All right.
Yeah.

08:12.893 --> 08:13.493
What do you want to
talk to us about?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.494
[sighing]

08:14.595 --> 08:15.829
Maybe this is not
the right moment.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.164
Let's wait till after supper.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.635
Where are you going?

08:21.735 --> 08:23.604
Unload the truck.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.139
Is this how it's going to be
the whole time he's visiting?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.741
You acting like
a great big baby?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.309
Did you here that
crack about alimony?

08:29.409 --> 08:31.111
He never pays my mother
a dime in alimony.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.781
It's a joke, Dan.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.616
Johnny Carson does
alimony jokes.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.919
And you're laying there, not now
Roseanne, Johnny's on a roll.

08:39.019 --> 08:39.820
OK.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.021
It's a joke.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.123
I just see him pulling
the same stuff on my kids

08:43.223 --> 08:44.858
as he pulled on me.
He's never around.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.093
And then he thinks
he can buy them

08:46.193 --> 08:48.762
off with presents, like
they think he's Santa Claus.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.664
Well, so they love
their grandfather.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.599
And that's great.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.167
They hate everybody else, Dan.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.535
You should give them a break.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.337
I mean, this is the guy that
helped you with your homework,

08:57.437 --> 08:59.006
and taught you how
to ride a bike,

08:59.106 --> 09:01.975
and took you to
the baseball games.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.376
He never did any of that.

09:06.113 --> 09:06.914
Well, so what?

09:07.014 --> 09:08.048
He got us a VCR.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.217
Same thing.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.686
[music playing]

09:16.757 --> 09:18.659
Roseanne, here.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.360
I brought the fondue pot.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.261
I hope I'm not too late.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.429
No, you're right on time.

09:22.529 --> 09:23.597
Give me that.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.432
Hey, I want you to
stay for dinner.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.967
Oh no, Roseanne,
I couldn't impose.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.268
Oh, no.
Nonsense.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.937
Aw, gee.
Are you still wearing that?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.839
You look like hell.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.140
God she's smooth.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.574
[beeping]

09:34.675 --> 09:36.977
Oh-- oh-- aw, you got me.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.445
I'm vaporized.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.347
Bebebe.

09:40.447 --> 09:41.615
Oh, hi Chrissie.

09:41.715 --> 09:45.118
Hey Ed, how are you.

09:45.218 --> 09:49.289
DJ, uh, give me just a
minute to get my molecules

09:49.389 --> 09:50.457
reorganized, all right?

09:50.557 --> 09:51.358
OK.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.361
I'll go kill Dad.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.229
Looks like we're
getting close here, huh?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.665
I'll go wash up.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.132
It's really good to
see you again, Crystal.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.471
Rosanne, I was just thinking,
maybe Ed would like it to be,

10:04.571 --> 10:05.639
you know, just him
and the family.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.774
Oh, nonsense.

10:06.874 --> 10:07.875
Now, quit whining Crystal.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.076
Men hate that.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.544
Go in my bedroom and
borrow some earrings

10:11.645 --> 10:12.512
and a scarf, or something.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.014
Becky, go with her.

10:14.114 --> 10:14.948
All right.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.453
You know what the sad part is?

10:20.553 --> 10:21.822
She doesn't suspect a thing.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.624
There's the groom.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.525
[door shutting]

10:25.625 --> 10:26.827
Hey, everybody.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.395
Hey what are you doing here?

10:28.495 --> 10:29.596
I'm hungry.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.865
Well, I didn't
invite you for dinner.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.067
When have I ever
waited for an invitation?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.039
Get the door,
Darlene, and let him in.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.273
Be nice to him.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.009
He's skittish.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.877
Who's skittish.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.079
Oh, just this guy from the mall.
Nobody you know.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.347
Nobody you'd like.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.049
How do you know I
wouldn't like you.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.317
You know, he ain't your type.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.686
He's shy, and really quiet.

10:52.786 --> 10:55.856
And I mean, the manages
this camera shop, you know?

10:55.956 --> 10:56.857
Whose type is he?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.392
He's Crystal's
type, so back off.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.593
Oh.

11:00.694 --> 11:01.528
Oh.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.196
You wouldn't want
to introduce me

11:03.296 --> 11:06.099
to some great guy with a job.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.101
Crystal looks hot, Mom.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.337
We went with the purple scarf
and the silver earrings.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.542
I begged you for
those silver earrings.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.676
What is going on?

11:16.777 --> 11:19.012
First you're all on my
case about not dating.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.181
And then you go doll
Crystal up so she can

11:21.281 --> 11:24.785
snag some great guy with a job.

11:24.885 --> 11:25.719
He's cute!

11:28.121 --> 11:30.023
He's not your type.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.591
What is my type, Roseanne?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.027
Some unemployed rodeo clown?

11:34.127 --> 11:34.928
Oh, oh.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.364
Bachelorette number two.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.899
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

11:38.999 --> 11:39.833
Hey, Mom!

11:39.933 --> 11:41.468
Go shoot your sister.

11:41.568 --> 11:42.669
OK.

11:42.770 --> 11:45.605
Hey, I promise the
next guy is for you, OK?

11:45.705 --> 11:46.807
But this one's for crystal.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.541
Now, if you want to go for
dinner, pull up a chair

11:48.641 --> 11:50.177
and set yourself a place, OK?

11:50.277 --> 11:51.611
But hands off the camera guy.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.428
[laughing]

12:21.174 --> 12:24.277
Donald, I don't believe
you've met my sister Jackie.

12:24.377 --> 12:26.046
It's a pleasure to meet you.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.514
[laughing]

12:27.614 --> 12:29.917
[music playing]

12:35.856 --> 12:37.124
So you went to Lanford High.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.125
Yes, Donald.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.359
They're the Fighting
Tigers, right?

12:39.459 --> 12:40.460
Mm-hmm.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.628
Have they always been
the fighting tigers?

12:41.728 --> 12:43.797
I don't know!

12:43.897 --> 12:46.099
Let me go find out.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.400
So Dan, you work in drywall.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.637
That's 12 questions in a
row, in case you're counting.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.539
Oh, he's just
nervous, you know.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.707
That's how he tries
to make conversation.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.244
Get him off my back.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.046
You were begging me
to fix you up with him.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.915
That was before I found
out he was the question man.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.283
What kind of car do you drive?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.717
Does it get good mileage?

13:04.818 --> 13:06.053
What's your favorite
kind of soup?

13:06.153 --> 13:07.754
So did you do it in here?

13:07.855 --> 13:09.222
I didn't design
this kitchen, Donald.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.123
Who did?

13:10.223 --> 13:11.291
Some guy named Garvin Eddy.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.960
Jackie, were
you a cheerleader?

13:13.060 --> 13:14.761
No, Donald.

13:14.862 --> 13:18.231
Did you try out and not make
it, or just not try out?

13:18.331 --> 13:21.168
You know, Crystal was
on the pompom squad.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.469
- Really?
- Oh, dear.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.773
Do you bring your
own pompoms or does

13:26.874 --> 13:27.774
the school give them to you?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.542
They gave them to me.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.079
You know, Jackie was on
the field hockey team.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.446
No kidding.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.748
[laughing]

13:36.783 --> 13:39.252
Do you use a ball or a puck?

13:39.352 --> 13:42.255
Hey, you know what's really
great after a great big dinner

13:42.355 --> 13:43.590
is a nice drive.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.092
Jackie, why don't
you take Donald

13:45.192 --> 13:46.126
on a nice little drive, huh?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.928
- Roseanne.
- Oh, I know.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.898
You want to borrow one of my
Isidora Duncan type of scarves.

13:50.998 --> 13:54.734
Well, I've got it right
here in the bedroom.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.470
Can I buy this at a store, or
do I have to order it from you?

13:57.570 --> 14:00.307
Hey, I promised the kids I'd
watch one of those movie tapes

14:00.407 --> 14:01.208
with them.

14:01.308 --> 14:04.644
Oh, I'll go with you.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.114
[laughing]

14:10.150 --> 14:11.818
So Donald, you work
in a camera shop.

14:11.919 --> 14:12.920
Do you develop your film?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.721
Do you send it to a lab?
What kind of a lab?

14:14.821 --> 14:18.191
Is it a big lab?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.093
I want that guy
to get out of here.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.594
So tell him to leave.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.862
No, I can't tell him to leave.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.031
You tell me to leave.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.032
Yeah, and take him with you.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.399
Not on your life.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.002
You're not going
to believe this.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.670
I come in here, in
his bedroom, and what

14:30.770 --> 14:32.973
do you think I see, right
here on this spot, right here?

14:33.073 --> 14:35.909
Crystal and Ed
(WHISPERED) kissing.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.544
Making out?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.746
Like trying to
climb each other.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.681
My god!

14:41.781 --> 14:43.283
See, so I figure
I can find out

14:43.383 --> 14:44.851
what's going on if you
and the quiz-master

14:44.952 --> 14:46.053
will get the hell out of here.

14:46.153 --> 14:46.954
OK.

14:47.054 --> 14:47.955
Yeah.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.222
But I want to hear
about this later.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.690
I'll-- I'll call
you, for sure.

14:50.790 --> 14:52.692
What if he hits on me?

14:52.792 --> 14:54.661
Oh, Jackie, he's annoying.

14:54.761 --> 14:55.728
He's not desperate.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.601
[screaming]

15:01.701 --> 15:04.037
[banging]

15:06.773 --> 15:08.475
- What's wrong with DJ?
- Oh.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.676
His death ray broke.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.211
How did that happen?

15:11.311 --> 15:13.846
Oh, that's not important.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.648
OK, Donald!

15:15.748 --> 15:16.616
I'm ready.
Let's go.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.751
Great.
So where do you want to go?

15:18.851 --> 15:19.752
Whose car do you want to take?

15:19.852 --> 15:20.887
I-- is it far?

15:20.988 --> 15:22.255
Oh, you'll find out
when you get there.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.124
Listen, Donald, uh,
thanks for coming.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.425
Yeah, bye.
- OK.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.626
Adult time.

15:26.726 --> 15:27.660
Everybody upstairs.
Go on.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.962
Run along.
Go on.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.097
Come on.

15:30.197 --> 15:30.763
That's not fair we're
watching a videotape.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.165
Oh, yeah, you're right.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.600
Boy, there's logic for you.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.734
Can't wait till I have kids.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.569
Just tell them they're
right and they'll have

15:36.669 --> 15:37.737
to do every little thing I say.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.209
Funny how Donald and
Jackie hit it right off.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.611
I would have said Donald was
more, say, Crystal's type,

15:44.711 --> 15:46.213
but what do I know?

15:46.313 --> 15:48.281
Absolutely nothing, my pet.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.422
So, Ed, Crystal, what's new?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.361
Well, Danny, you
know, I told you before

16:01.461 --> 16:02.762
and I wanted to
tell you something.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.332
Dad, before you say anything,
I was way out of line before.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.234
You come over here, your
intentions are good,

16:07.334 --> 16:08.368
and I was a complete jerk.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.203
Uh, maybe I should
leave you all alone.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.504
This is a family moment.

16:11.604 --> 16:12.672
No, Crystal, stay, please.

16:12.772 --> 16:13.673
I want you to.

16:13.773 --> 16:14.641
Listen, Dan.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.576
Dad this is
really tough for me.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.677
Let me get the whole thing out.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.017
Whatever happened
between you and Mom,

16:24.117 --> 16:27.854
and between you
and me, is history.

16:27.954 --> 16:28.755
Let's start over.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.794
That's great, son.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.796
I can't tell you how long I
wanted to hear those words.

16:36.896 --> 16:38.398
I--

16:39.432 --> 16:41.068
and you're right.

16:41.168 --> 16:41.968
You're right.

16:42.069 --> 16:47.740
We've got to start over, because

16:47.840 --> 16:48.775
starting over's good.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.111
I mean, it's just
a good, good thing.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.480
Uh, and-- as a matter of
fact, in the last year,

16:53.580 --> 16:57.217
I've been sort of starting all
over myself, you know, because

16:58.751 --> 17:00.087
Crystal and I have
been seeing each other.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.400
What do you mean, seeing?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.502
Well, you know, since
last Thanksgiving,

17:15.602 --> 17:18.671
uh, I mean, we just started
getting together whenever my--

17:18.771 --> 17:20.373
you know, I had a
break in my schedule.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.309
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about it Roseanne.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.444
But we didn't know how
you two would take it.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.849
Well, are you happy?

17:29.949 --> 17:31.184
Yes I am.

17:31.284 --> 17:36.856
Well, then, I'm happy for you.

17:36.956 --> 17:41.060
As to how Dan's going to
take it, well, take it, Dan.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.100
You're more than 20
years older than she is.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.168
I've done the math.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.502
You've known her
since she was a girl.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.970
She's a woman now.

17:51.070 --> 17:51.904
With a kid.

17:52.004 --> 17:52.839
I met him.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.108
What-- what do
you want from me?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.376
I wanted you to know.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.610
I felt like an
idiot coming around

17:57.710 --> 17:59.045
here and not stopping by.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.547
I mean, we felt like we
were sneaking around.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.681
Well, now we know.

18:01.781 --> 18:02.582
Good.

18:05.552 --> 18:09.055
Dan, I'm going
with it Roseanne.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.123
You're not upset?

18:13.059 --> 18:15.428
Well, to be honest with you,
I feel a little bad for Donald.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.701
Donald, the question man?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.236
Oh, I'm glad you're
good with this, son,

18:23.336 --> 18:24.604
because we're getting married.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.773
That's it.

18:26.873 --> 18:27.674
Where are you going?

18:27.774 --> 18:30.377
Somewhere else.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.280
Dan!

18:33.380 --> 18:34.781
I'm Sorry.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.048
Get inside, Crystal.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.116
I'm not going, Dan.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.385
Crystal, it's
freezing out here.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.253
We want your blessing, Dan.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.193
You don't know what you're
getting yourself into.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.695
You think you're getting a
husband a companion, a father

18:48.795 --> 18:50.197
for Lonnie, forget about it.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.364
He's not going to
be there for you.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.132
Dan, I love him.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.434
Why?

18:54.534 --> 18:59.606
He's kind, and he's, uh,
generous, and he's funny.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.342
He reminds me a lot of you, Dan.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.510
I got to hand it
to you, Crystal.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.878
You figured out the
exact wrong thing to say.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.248
Well, it's true, you know?

19:08.348 --> 19:10.683
You just don't give
the man any credit.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.720
I've known him
all my life, honey.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.622
I know exactly what's
going to happen.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.457
A year from now you're going
to be lonelier than you've

19:17.557 --> 19:18.491
ever been in your life.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.659
And you're going to
be married so you

19:19.759 --> 19:20.993
won't even be able
to date the clowns

19:21.093 --> 19:22.229
Roseanne sets you up with.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.896
Well, that's a chance
I'm willing to take.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.998
Well, then we got nothing
more to say to each other.

19:26.098 --> 19:28.034
Dan, it can't be like this.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.969
Whether you like it or
not, your father and I

19:30.069 --> 19:31.070
are getting married.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.206
And, well, I'll kind
of be like your mother.

19:38.044 --> 19:38.845
I want your blessing.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.016
I'm sorry, Crystal.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.019
Well then, Dan Conner, you
don't get your coat back.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.959
Thanks, Mom.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.362
[music playing]

20:01.167 --> 20:02.068
Got anymore coffee?

20:02.168 --> 20:02.969
Whole pot.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.272
Pour it on me.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.775
Anything you say, dearest.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.645
You know, a lesser man would
have come back in for his coat.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.980
I didn't want to see my father.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.948
I got some thinking to do.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.217
We've got to figure out how
to deal with this, Roseanne.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.586
Deal with what?

20:19.686 --> 20:21.621
We buy a gift and we
show up for the wedding.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.723
I think I'm going to
buy her an electric wok.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.425
I know she doesn't have one.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.359
[laughing]

20:26.459 --> 20:28.094
I'm not going to the wedding.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.529
Yes, you are.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.430
You're the best man.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.131
And I'm the matron of honor.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.866
We're going to walk
down that aisle together

20:33.966 --> 20:35.568
and it'll be just
like old times,

20:35.668 --> 20:37.270
only this time we
need a wider aisle.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.474
Oh, yeah?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.610
Who decided all this?

20:43.710 --> 20:46.779
My best friend Crystal asked
me to help plan her wedding

20:46.879 --> 20:48.247
and I said yes.
- What?

20:48.348 --> 20:49.148
Are you crazy?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.017
This whole thing is a mistake.

20:51.117 --> 20:51.918
No.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.553
I don't know that Dan.

20:53.653 --> 20:56.122
I just see two people who
obviously love each other.

20:56.222 --> 20:59.058
And you know, they're just
looking for some support

20:59.158 --> 21:00.660
from their family and friends.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.895
You're not doing
this Roseanne.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.564
You know, you're
really sexy when

21:04.664 --> 21:06.032
you attempt to be assertive.

21:08.134 --> 21:09.268
I'm not kidding.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.303
You're not going.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.071
Neither am I. And
that's an end to it.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.845
No it ain't.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.247
[music playing]

21:27.587 --> 21:29.389
Wh-- what do you do?

21:29.489 --> 21:30.857
I'll bet you're good
at it though, you know.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.291
You're good at it, right?

21:32.392 --> 21:33.960
I sell cameras right
here in the mall.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.595
You ever use a camera?

21:35.695 --> 21:37.497
[thudding]

21:37.597 --> 21:40.967
Boy, that must have hurt.

21:41.067 --> 21:43.135
Do you need an aspirin?

21:43.235 --> 21:44.937
Anybody got an aspirin?

21:45.037 --> 21:47.940
You want a regular
or a buffered?

21:48.040 --> 21:48.841
Jackie.

21:48.941 --> 21:49.742
Jackie?

21:54.046 --> 21:56.716
[sound effect playing]
