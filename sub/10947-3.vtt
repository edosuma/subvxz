00:02.420 --> 00:03.630
KATARA: <i>Water...</i>

00:04.800 --> 00:05.970
<i>Earth...</i>

00:06.670 --> 00:07.880
<i>Fire...</i>

00:08.970 --> 00:10.050
<i>Air.</i>

00:11.180 --> 00:14.430
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.350 --> 00:18.650
<i>Then everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.650 --> 00:20.770
<i>Only the Avatar,</i>

00:20.860 --> 00:22.320
<i>master of all four elements,</i>

00:22.400 --> 00:23.570
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:23.650 --> 00:25.400
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:25.490 --> 00:26.740
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.200 --> 00:28.360
<i>A hundred years passed,</i>

00:28.450 --> 00:30.870
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar,</i>

00:30.950 --> 00:32.950
<i>an airbender named Aang,</i>

00:33.030 --> 00:35.080
<i>and although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:38.330
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:38.870 --> 00:41.920
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:03.860 --> 01:05.450
AANG: Wait till you see it, Katara.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.200
The air temple
is one of the most beautiful places

01:07.280 --> 01:08.410
in the world.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.280
Aang, I know you're excited,

01:10.370 --> 01:11.580
but it's been a hundred years

01:11.660 --> 01:12.990
since you've been home.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.540
That's why I'm so excited!

01:14.870 --> 01:17.460
It's just that a lot can change
in all that time.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.540
I know,

01:18.630 --> 01:20.040
but I need to see it for myself.

01:22.460 --> 01:24.340
( SNORING )

01:24.420 --> 01:25.880
Wake up, Sokka.

01:25.970 --> 01:27.680
Air temple, here we come!

01:27.760 --> 01:29.260
( GROAN )

01:29.340 --> 01:31.140
Sleep now. Temple later.

01:31.220 --> 01:32.760
( SNORING )

01:38.310 --> 01:39.650
Sokka, wake up!

01:39.730 --> 01:41.650
There's a prickle snake
in your sleeping bag!

01:42.440 --> 01:43.480
Aah!

01:43.570 --> 01:44.900
Get it off! Get it off!

01:44.990 --> 01:45.990
Aah!

01:46.110 --> 01:47.280
Heh heh heh!

01:47.360 --> 01:48.610
Great. You're awake.

01:48.700 --> 01:49.700
Let's go.

01:54.830 --> 01:56.160
Uncle, I want the repairs made

01:56.250 --> 01:57.290
as quickly as possible.

01:57.370 --> 01:58.710
I don't want to stay too long

01:58.790 --> 02:00.000
and risk losing his trail.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.290
You mean the Avatar?

02:01.380 --> 02:02.670
Don't mention his name on these docks.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.590
Once word gets out that he's alive,

02:04.670 --> 02:06.720
every firebender
will be out looking for him,

02:06.800 --> 02:08.630
and I don't want anyone
getting in the way.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.680
Getting in the way of what,

02:10.760 --> 02:11.930
Prince Zuko.

02:12.010 --> 02:13.470
Captain Zhao.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.890
It's commander now.

02:14.970 --> 02:16.350
And General Iroh,

02:16.430 --> 02:18.480
great hero of our nation.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.230
Retired general.

02:20.310 --> 02:21.940
The Fire Lord's brother and son

02:22.020 --> 02:23.900
are welcome guests anytime.

02:24.230 --> 02:25.690
What brings you to my harbor?

02:25.780 --> 02:27.570
Our ship is being repaired.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.160
That's quite a bit of damage.

02:31.530 --> 02:34.030
Yes. You wouldn't believe
what happened.

02:34.740 --> 02:36.830
Uncle, tell Commander Zhao
what happened.

02:36.910 --> 02:38.580
Yes, I will do that.

02:38.870 --> 02:40.920
It was incredible.

02:41.330 --> 02:42.920
What, did we crash or something?

02:43.000 --> 02:46.500
Yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.

02:47.010 --> 02:48.010
Really?

02:48.090 --> 02:51.220
You must regale me
with all the thrilling details.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.600
Join me for a drink?

02:53.930 --> 02:55.310
Sorry, but we have to go.

02:55.390 --> 02:56.770
Prince Zuko,

02:56.850 --> 02:59.180
show Commander Zhao your respect.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.940
We would be honored to join you.

03:02.020 --> 03:05.520
Do you have any ginseng tea?
It's my favorite.

03:05.610 --> 03:06.900
( GRUNT )

03:12.610 --> 03:14.370
( RUMBLES )

03:14.450 --> 03:16.030
Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right?

03:16.120 --> 03:17.870
I'm trying to find us some food.

03:24.710 --> 03:27.340
Hey! Who ate all
my blubbered seal jerky?

03:27.420 --> 03:29.510
Oh. That was food?

03:29.590 --> 03:31.670
I used it to start
the campfire last night.

03:31.760 --> 03:32.880
Sorry.

03:32.970 --> 03:34.510
You what?

03:34.590 --> 03:35.800
Aww.

03:35.890 --> 03:37.930
No wonder the flames smelled so good.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.770
AANG: The Potola mountain range!

03:41.850 --> 03:43.350
We're almost there!

03:43.440 --> 03:45.360
Aang, before we get to the temple,

03:45.440 --> 03:47.570
I want to talk to you
about the airbenders.

03:47.650 --> 03:48.780
What about them?

03:48.860 --> 03:49.940
Well...

03:50.030 --> 03:51.400
I just want you to be prepared

03:51.490 --> 03:52.950
for what you might see.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.280
The Fire Nation is ruthless.

03:55.370 --> 03:57.370
They killed my mother,

03:57.450 --> 03:58.580
and they could have done the same

03:58.660 --> 04:00.080
to your people.

04:00.410 --> 04:02.330
Just because no one
has seen an airbender

04:02.410 --> 04:04.120
doesn't mean the Fire Nation
killed them all.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.540
They probably escaped.

04:05.630 --> 04:07.420
I know it's hard to accept.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.130
You don't understand, Katara.

04:09.210 --> 04:10.590
The only way to get to
an airbender temple

04:10.670 --> 04:12.170
is on a flying bison,

04:12.260 --> 04:14.340
and I doubt the Fire Nation
has any flying bison.

04:14.430 --> 04:15.550
Right, Appa?

04:15.640 --> 04:16.800
( APPA GROWLS )

04:16.890 --> 04:18.050
Yip yip!

04:33.190 --> 04:36.870
AANG: There it is,
the Southern Air Temple.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.330
Aang, it's amazing!

04:40.200 --> 04:42.370
We're home, buddy. We're home.

04:47.460 --> 04:48.630
And by year's end,

04:48.710 --> 04:50.840
the Earth Kingdom capital
will be under our rule.

04:51.670 --> 04:53.970
The Fire Lord will finally claim

04:54.050 --> 04:55.260
victory in this war.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.010
If my father thinks
the rest of the world

04:57.090 --> 04:58.260
will follow him willingly,

04:58.340 --> 04:59.550
then he is a fool.

05:00.010 --> 05:01.010
Two years at sea

05:01.100 --> 05:02.770
have done little
to temper your tongue.

05:03.730 --> 05:07.230
So, how's your search
for the Avatar going?

05:07.310 --> 05:09.400
( CRASH )

05:09.690 --> 05:12.190
Uh... My fault entirely.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.610
We haven't found him yet.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.530
Did you really expect to?

05:16.610 --> 05:18.870
The Avatar died a hundred years ago

05:18.950 --> 05:21.490
along with the rest of the airbenders.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.830
Unless you found some evidence

05:24.910 --> 05:26.540
that the Avatar is alive.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.630
No. Nothing.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.630
Prince Zuko,
the Avatar is the only one

05:31.710 --> 05:32.880
who can stop the Fire Nation

05:32.960 --> 05:34.460
from winning this war.

05:34.550 --> 05:36.590
If you have an ounce of loyalty left,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.640
you'll tell me what you found.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.100
I haven't found anything.

05:41.850 --> 05:43.010
It's like you said―

05:43.100 --> 05:46.270
The Avatar probably died
a long time ago.

05:46.850 --> 05:48.730
Come on, uncle. We're going.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.940
MAN: Commander Zhao,

05:51.020 --> 05:53.020
we interrogated the crew
as you instructed.

05:53.110 --> 05:54.480
They confirmed Prince Zuko

05:54.570 --> 05:56.360
had the Avatar in custody

05:56.440 --> 05:57.990
but let him escape.

05:58.780 --> 06:00.700
Now remind me,

06:00.780 --> 06:04.990
how exactly was your ship damaged?

06:12.920 --> 06:14.500
So where do I get something to eat?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.800
You're lucky enough
to be one of the first outsiders

06:17.880 --> 06:19.970
to ever visit an airbender temple,

06:20.050 --> 06:22.010
and all you can think about is food?

06:22.300 --> 06:24.850
SOKKA: I'm just a simple guy
with simple needs.

06:26.060 --> 06:27.230
So that's where my friends and I

06:27.310 --> 06:28.430
would play airball,

06:28.520 --> 06:30.600
and over there is where
the bison would sleep.

06:30.690 --> 06:31.690
And...

06:31.770 --> 06:32.900
( SIGH )

06:32.980 --> 06:34.230
What's wrong?

06:34.320 --> 06:37.150
This place used to be full of monks
and lemurs and bison.

06:37.490 --> 06:39.030
Now there's just a bunch of weeds.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.410
I can't believe how much
things have changed.

06:45.370 --> 06:46.370
SOKKA: So, uh,

06:46.450 --> 06:48.120
this airball game― How do you play?

07:01.090 --> 07:02.180
Ugh!

07:02.260 --> 07:03.340
Ooh!

07:04.470 --> 07:05.760
Ha ha ha!

07:06.430 --> 07:08.770
Aang seven, Sokka zero.

07:09.230 --> 07:10.600
Making him feel better

07:10.690 --> 07:12.150
is putting me in a world of hurt.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.280
Katara, check this out.

07:20.530 --> 07:21.610
Fire Nation.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.950
We should tell him.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.700
Aang, there's something
you need to see.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.410
Ok.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.580
Oh!

07:33.670 --> 07:34.790
What is it?

07:34.880 --> 07:38.090
Uh... Just a new
waterbending move I learned.

07:38.170 --> 07:40.050
Nice one. But enough practicing.

07:40.510 --> 07:42.380
We have a whole temple to see.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.010
You know,
you can't protect him forever.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.810
Katara, firebenders were here.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.270
You can't pretend they weren't.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.360
I can for Aang's sake.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.320
If he finds out that the Fire Nation
invaded his home,

08:01.400 --> 08:02.610
he'll be devastated.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.950
AANG: Hey, guys!

08:04.360 --> 08:05.660
I want you to meet somebody.

08:05.740 --> 08:06.780
Who's that?

08:06.870 --> 08:08.280
Monk Gyatso,

08:08.370 --> 08:09.910
the greatest airbender in the world.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.750
He taught me everything I know.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
But the true secret
is in the gooey center.

08:20.590 --> 08:21.590
Hmm.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.800
My ancient cake making technique

08:23.880 --> 08:25.930
isn't the only thing on your mind,

08:26.010 --> 08:27.680
is it, Aang?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.600
This whole Avatar thing―

08:29.680 --> 08:31.890
Maybe the monks made a mistake.

08:32.230 --> 08:33.850
The only mistake they made

08:33.940 --> 08:36.650
was telling you before you turned 16.

08:36.730 --> 08:39.520
But we can't concern ourselves
with what was.

08:39.610 --> 08:42.030
We must act on what is.

08:46.610 --> 08:47.910
But, Gyatso,

08:47.990 --> 08:49.830
how do I know if I'm ready for this?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.250
Your questions will be answered

08:52.330 --> 08:56.370
when you're old enough
to enter the air temple sanctuary.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.960
Inside, you will meet someone

08:59.040 --> 09:01.300
who will guide you on your journey.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.550
Who is it?

09:02.630 --> 09:04.170
When you are ready,

09:04.260 --> 09:06.340
he will reveal himself to you.

09:06.430 --> 09:07.430
Hmm.

09:07.510 --> 09:08.680
Now...

09:09.300 --> 09:12.140
Are you going to help me
with these cakes

09:12.220 --> 09:13.350
or not?

09:13.430 --> 09:14.730
All right.

09:16.190 --> 09:18.520
One... Two...

09:18.600 --> 09:19.610
Three.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.990
( LEMURS CHATTERING )

09:26.900 --> 09:29.070
( LAUGHING )

09:29.530 --> 09:31.490
Your aim has improved greatly,

09:31.580 --> 09:33.540
my young pupil.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.420
You must miss him.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.710
Yeah.

09:40.790 --> 09:42.130
Where are you going?

09:42.210 --> 09:43.760
The air temple sanctuary.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.340
There's someone I'm ready to meet.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.470
KATARA: But, Aang,

09:54.560 --> 09:55.890
no one could have survived in there

09:55.980 --> 09:57.600
for a hundred years.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.230
It's not impossible.

09:59.310 --> 10:01.270
I survived in the iceberg
for that long.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.360
Good point.

10:02.650 --> 10:04.400
Katara, whoever's in there

10:04.480 --> 10:06.280
might help me figure out
this Avatar thing.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.450
And whoever's in there
might have a medley

10:08.530 --> 10:11.410
of delicious cured meats.

10:12.370 --> 10:13.580
Ooh!

10:13.660 --> 10:14.660
Unh!

10:14.740 --> 10:15.950
Ohh.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.870
I don't suppose you have a key.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.750
The key, Sokka, is airbending.

10:49.610 --> 10:50.990
Hello?

10:51.410 --> 10:52.820
Anyone home?

11:05.210 --> 11:06.590
ZHAO: So a 12-year-old boy

11:06.670 --> 11:08.840
bested you and your firebenders.

11:09.550 --> 11:11.380
You're more pathetic than I thought.

11:11.470 --> 11:12.890
I underestimated him once,

11:12.970 --> 11:14.300
but it will not happen again.

11:14.390 --> 11:15.760
No, it will not,

11:15.850 --> 11:17.600
